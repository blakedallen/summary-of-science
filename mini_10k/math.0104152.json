Quick overview. Recently we managed to prove the existence of integral\ncanonical models of Shimura varieties of preabelian type with respect to primes p \u2265 3\n(cf. [Va2, 6.4.1 and defs. of 3.2.6]; see [Va2, 6.8] and either 4.6.4 or [Va3] for the case\nof Shimura varieties of preabelian type which are neither of compact type nor of abelian\ntype, and see \u00a76 and [Va5] for the case p = 3). For the general theory of such integral\nmodels we refer to [Va2, \u00a73]; for different types of Shimura varieties we refer to [Va2,\n2.5]. With this paper, which is a natural continuation of [Va2], we start an extensive\nprogram of proving that many well known results for integral canonical models of Siegel\nmodular varieties remain true (under proper formulation) for all integral canonical models\nof Shimura varieties of preabelian type. Here we are concerned with points of these\nmodels with values in regular, formally smooth schemes over rings of Witt vectors of a\ngiven length (finite or infinite) of a perfect field. Special attention is paid to points with\nvalues in (the Witt ring of) a perfect field.\nFor the sake of generality and motivated by applications to many other geometric\ncontexts, most of the things are stated in the context and language of Fontaine categories\n(see 1.2.4 and 1.2.9). So this paper (together with the ones continuing it) represents:\nF1. A foundation for integral aspects of Shimura varieties, and\nF2. A foundation for Fontaine categories.\nFor a faster publication of our main results pertaining to the program, we split them\nin three parts, to be published separately. The first part is the present paper and so\ncontains \u00a71-4, the second part will contain \u00a75-10 and the third part will contain \u00a711-14.\nThe results mentioned in [Va2, 1.6-7] are proved in \u00a72-14. In \u00a71-4 we concentrate (this\nwas the initial goal) in reobtaining in a new manner:\n\u2022 the theory (due to Serre\u2013Tate; see [Me, Appendix] for its first features) of ordinary\nabelian varieties and p-divisible groups (over perfect fields of characteristic p) and of\ntheir canonical lifts,\n\u2022 the theory (due to Serre\u2013Tate and Dwork; see [Ka1] and [Ka3-4]) of canonical coordinates of the formal moduli scheme of deformations of an ordinary abelian variety\nover an algebraically closed field,\n\u2022 a proof of Manin's problem (first solved in [Ta, p. 98]),\nand in extending these theories to the geometric context of integral canonical models of\nShimura varieties of preabelian type and even more generally, to the abstract context\n(see 1.1) of Shimura \u03c3-crystals. The case p = 2 is treated in maximal generality (like\nno restriction in the abstract context and, in the geometric context, we logically restrict\n5\n\n\fto integral canonical models of Shimura varieties of abelian type in mixed characteristic\n(0, 2) whose existence is proved here).\nOn the way we obtain many other results pertaining to p-divisible groups, to abelian\nvarieties, to the mentioned integral canonical models and to Fontaine categories.\nWith p \u2265 2, two things are worth being mentioned from the very beginning. First,\nwe show that the number of isomorphism classes of p-divisible groups of a given rank over\nan algebraically closed field k\u0304 of characteristic p which are definable over a fixed finite\nfield Fpq (with pq elements; here q \u2208 N), is finite and does not depend on k\u0304 (see 1.6.4).\nSecond, we construct versal global deformations, i.e. versal deformations over the p-adic\ncompletion of (a particular type of) pro-\u00e9tale schemes over smooth, affine schemes over\nWitt rings of perfect fields (of characteristic p), of p-divisible groups over such fields, cf.\nTheorem 1 of 3.15.1. Theorem 1 of 3.15.1 complements:\n\u2013 Grothendieck's theorem of [Il, 4.4] (we get stronger forms than what the combination of loc. cit. and Artin's approximation theorem can produce);\n\u2013 Raynaud's theorem of [BBM, 3.1.1] (it is effective, i.e. it has \u2013cf. its proof\u2013\nan explicit, concrete aspect and it offers in many regular contexts \u2013see the application\nof its proof to the Theorem of 3.15.2\u2013 more information on embeddings of finite, flat,\ncommutative group schemes of p-power order into p-divisible groups);\n\u2013 Faltings's theorem of [Fa1, 7.1] (it is effective and works for p = 2 as well);\n\u2013 de Jong's theorem of [dJ2, first main result] (it is effective; moreover it handles\nthe case of truncations as well: for instance, see its application in the proof of Theorem\nof 3.15.2).\nOver algebraically closed fields of characteristic p, the words \"p-adic completion\"\nand \"pro-\u00e9tale\" can be dropped (cf. Theorem 13 of 1.12).\n1.1. Introducing Shimura (filtered) \u03c3-crystals. In what follows k is a perfect\nfield of positive characteristic p, W (k) is the ring of (infinite) Witt vectors of k and \u03c3\nis the Frobenius automorphism of W (k) or of B(k) := W (k)[ p1 ]. We denote by \u0112 the\nalgebraic closure of a field E. The proof of the basic result 5.1 of [Va2] leads to the\nstudy of \u03c3-crystals over k endowed with an extra structure (cf. [Va2, 5.6.5]). Moving\nfrom the geometric context of loc. cit. to a more general and abstract context, we start\nconsidering a \u03c3-crystal (M, \u03c6) over k (so M is a free W (k)-module of finite rank and\n\u03c6 is a \u03c3-linear endomorphism of M producing a \u03c3-linear automorphism of M [ p1 ]) and a\nquasi-split reductive subgroup G of GL(M ) satisfying the following axioms:\ni) There is a family of tensors (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J in spaces of the form M \u2297n \u2297W (k) M \u2217\u2297m [ p1 ] (with\nM \u2217 the dual of M and with n, m \u2208 N \u222a {0}), such that \u03c6(t\u03b1 ) = t\u03b1 , \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 J , and G\nis the Zariski closure of the subgroup of GL(M [ p1 ]) fixing t\u03b1 , \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 J , in GL(M );\nii) There is a cocharacter \u03bc : Gm \u2192 G producing a direct sum decomposition M =\nF 1 \u2295 F 0 such that \u03b2 \u2208 Gm (W (k)) acts through \u03bc on F i as the multiplication with\n\u03b2 \u2212i , i = 0, 1. Moreover F 1 is a proper direct summand of M (this last condition is\ninserted just to avoid trivial cases, cf. 2.2.9 11));\n6\n\n\fiii) The triple (M, F 1 , \u03c6) is a filtered \u03c3-crystal (i.e. we have \u03c6( p1 F 1 + M ) = M ).\nThe triple (M, \u03c6, G) (resp. quadruple (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G)) is called a Shimura (resp. a\nShimura filtered) \u03c3-crystal. The pair (Lie(G), \u03c6) is called the Shimura Lie \u03c3-crystal\nattached to (M, \u03c6, G). Here Lie(G) is the Lie algebra of G and we still denote by \u03c6\nthe resulting \u03c3-linear Lie automorphism of Lie(G)[ p1 ] obtained via the logical inclusion\nLie(G) \u2282 End(M ) and the natural action of \u03c6 on End(M )[ p1 ] that takes m \u2208 End(M )[ p1 ]\ninto \u03c6 \u25e6 m \u25e6 \u03c6\u22121 \u2208 End(M )[ p1 ]. Axiom i) guarantees that \u03c6 normalizes Lie(G)[ p1 ]; we have\n\u03c6(pLie(G)) \u2282 Lie(G), cf. axiom iii). See 2.1 for the (standard) way \u03c6 acts on the spaces\nof i).\nFixing the group G, the family of tensors (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J and the G(W (k))-conjugacy class\n[\u03bc] of the cocharacter \u03bc, every \u03c3-linear endomorphism \u03c61 of M corresponding to any\nother \u03c3-crystal (M, \u03c61 ) satisfying the logical analogues of axioms i) to iii), up to G(W (k))conjugation, can be put in the form \u03c61 = g\u03c6, with g \u2208 G(W (k)) (cf. the second paragraph\nof \u00a73).\nIf G = GL(M ), then we can take the set J of indices to be the empty set and so we\nregain the classical context of Serre\u2013Tate's (ordinary) theory.\n1.2. The core: some basic results. The case p = 2 is treated as asides. So, in all\nthat follows, without a special reference we assume p > 2. Our basic results are grouped\nin 3.1 and 3.6.\n1.2.0. On the first group of basic results. In 3.1 we present the first group of\nbasic results. For our (standard) conventions on Newton polygons see 2.1. We have:\nTheorem 1. a) Among all Shimura \u03c3-crystals (M, g\u03c6, G) (with g \u2208 G(W (k))),\nthe ones which have the smallest Newton polygon (in the sense that all others have a\nNewton polygon strictly above it) are precisely the ones (M, g1 \u03c6, G) (called G-ordinary\n\u03c3-crystals) for which there is a cocharacter \u03bc : Gm \u2192 G (as in the above axioms), such\nthat the parabolic Lie subalgebra p1 of Lie(G) corresponding to non-negative slopes of\nthe Shimura Lie \u03c3-crystal Lie(G), g1 \u03c6) (see 2.2.3 3)) is contained in the Lie algebra\nF 0 (Lie(G)) of the parabolic subgroup of G normalizing the direct summand F 1 of M\ndefined (as in 1.1 ii)) by \u03bc.\nb) If (M, g1 \u03c6, G) is a G-ordinary \u03c3-crystal, then there is a unique Shimura filtered\n\u03c3-crystal (M, F 1 , g1 \u03c6, G) (called the G-canonical lift of (M, g1 \u03c6, G)) such that for each\nx \u2208 p1 , we have x(F 1 ) \u2282 F 1 .\nc) Among all Shimura \u03c3-crystals (M, g\u03c6, G) (with g \u2208 G(W (k))), the ones which\nhave the smallest Newton polygon of their attached Shimura Lie \u03c3-crystals (Lie(G), g\u03c6),\nare precisely the G-ordinary \u03c3-crystals.\nd) Any Shimura \u03c3-crystal (M, g\u03c6, G) is the specialization of a GW (k1 ) -ordinary \u03c31 crystal (M \u2297W (k) W (k1 ), g1 (\u03c6 \u2297 \u03c31 ), GW (k1 ) ), with g1 \u2208 G(W (k1 )) (here \u03c31 is the Frobenius automorphism of the Witt ring of a perfect field k1 containing k; we can take k1 to\nbe the field of fractions of the perfection of k[[X]], where X is an independent variable).\n7\n\n\fReferring to a), the quadruple\n(Lie(G), g1 \u03c6, F 0 (Lie(G)), F 1 (Lie(G))),\nwith F 1 (Lie(G)) as the unipotent radical of F 0 (Lie(G)), is called the Shimura filtered\nLie \u03c3-crystal attached to (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G) and the inclusion p1 \u2282 F 0 (Lie(G)) is interpreted\nas (cf. def. 2.2.12 a)): it is of parabolic type. See 3.1.1.2 for the interpretation of the\nmentioned inclusion (resp. of the uniqueness part of b)) in terms of (see def. of 2.2.8 7)\nand of 2.2.9 6)) G-endomorphisms (resp. of automorphisms); so 3.1.1.2 represents the\ngeneralization of the classical result that any endomorphism of an ordinary p-divisible\ngroup over k lifts to its canonical lift.\n1.2.1. On the proof of Theorem 1. The proof of Theorem 1 is achieved by first\n(an idea suggested by G. Faltings) proving it for Shimura Lie \u03c3-crystals (Lie(G), g\u03c6).\nTo achieve this and to complete the proof of Theorem 1 we construct (see 3.6.7 for the\nexact form needed) global deformations of such (as in 1.1) Shimura filtered \u03c3-crystals;\ntheir goal is: to connect any Shimura \u03c3-crystal (M, g\u03c6, G) (with g \u2208 G(W (k))) with\n(the extension to k\u0304 of) a G-ordinary \u03c3-crystal (M, g1 \u03c6, G). Here by global we mean:\ndeformations over the p-adic completion of pro-\u00e9tale schemes over smooth, affine W (k)schemes, whose special fibres are connected and have a dense set of k\u0304-valued points. This\ntakes care of (a stronger form of) d) of Theorem 1, as it can be checked easily starting\nfrom Grothendieck\u2013Katz specialization theorem (see [Ka2, 2.3.1-2]) and from 1.2.1.0 2)\nand 3) below.\n1.2.1.0. Tools from the Lie context. The proof of Theorem 1 for Shimura Lie\n\u03c3-crystals (Lie(G), g\u03c6) (with g \u2208 G(W (k))), means three things:\n1) there is g1 \u2208 G(W (k)) such that for any x \u2208 p1 (defined in a) of Theorem 1) we have\nx(F 1 ) \u2282 F 1 (cf. 3.2.3);\n2) for any g \u2208 G(W (k)), the Newton polygon of (Lie(G), g\u03c6) is strictly above or equal\nto the Newton polygon of (Lie(G), g1 \u03c6);\n3) if in 2) we have equality of Newton polygons, then an explicit expression of g can be\ndetermined and the \u03c3-crystal (M, g\u03c6) has the same Newton polygon as the \u03c3-crystal\n(M, g1 \u03c6) (cf. 3.4.11 and 3.4.13).\nPart 1) is easy (as G is a quasi-split reductive group), while 3) is implicitly obtained\non the way \u2013see below\u2013 of proving 2) (cf. 3.4.8-11 and 3.7.4). From 1) to 3) and 1.2.1 we\nget a) and c) of Theorem 1 (see 3.2.4). Based on the fact that [\u03bc] is uniquely determined\nby (M, \u03c6, G) (cf. Fact 2 of 2.2.9 3)), the uniqueness part of b) of Theorem 1 is just a\nsimple property of parabolic subgroups of G (cf. 3.2.8).\nFor the proof of 2) we first show that for any g \u2208 G(W (k)), the Newton polygon of\n(Lie(G), g\u03c6) can not be strictly below the Newton polygon of (Lie(G), g1 \u03c6) (cf. 3.4.12).\nThis is achieved (cf. the proof of 3.4.6 needed to get 3.4.8, and so needed to get 3.4.12) by\nusing Lie stable p-ranks of Shimura \u03c3-crystals, via their interpretation (see 3.4.5.1 B; see\nalso the proof of 3.9.2) in terms of multiplicities of (suitable \u2013i.e. minimal in some relative\nsense\u2013 non-positive) slopes of Newton polygons of attached Shimura Lie \u03c3-crystals.\n8\n\n\fThe Lie stable p-rank of a Shimura \u03c3-crystal (M, \u03c6, G) is a non-negative integer\nassociated to (Lie(G), \u03c6): though it is defined just in 3.9.1 and 3.9.1.1, the very essence\nof its definition is already captured in 3.4.5 and 3.4.5.1. Here is a sample of how it can\nbe computed. If the adjoint group Gad of G is an absolutely simple group and \u03bc of 1.1\nii) does not factor through the center of G, then it is the dimension over k of the stable\nimage (i.e. of the image of the \"sufficiently high\" iterate) of the \u03c3-linear endomorphism\nF SHW of Lie(Gk ) = Lie(G)/pLie(G) defined by the reduction mod p of the \u03c3-linear\nendomorphism p\u03c6 of Lie(G) (warning: here \u03c6 is viewed as a \u03c3-linear automorphism of\nEnd(M )[ p1 ] and so p\u03c6 denotes its multiplication by p). As p\u03c6 normalizes the Lie algebras\nof the derived group Gder of G as well as of the adjoint group Gad of G (see 2.2.13 for\nthe adjoint context), this Lie stable p-rank can be computed as well (see 3.9.6) using the\nresulting \u03c3-linear endomorphism F SHW der (resp. F SHW ad ) of Lie(Gder )/pLie(Gder )\n(resp. of Lie(Gad )/pLie(Gad )).\n3.4.6 is a theorem on such Lie stable p-ranks capturing the very essence behind 2),\n3) and Theorem 2 below. Its proof is carried out in 3.5. It involves standard techniques\npertaining to (Lie algebras of) parabolic subgroups of Gk\u0304 : the well known classification\nof Shimura varieties of Hodge type (see [De2]; see also [Sa] or the abstract context of\n[Se2, \u00a73]), allows us to restate 3.4.6 in terms of\n\u2013 possible dimensions of suitable intersections of Lie algebras of unipotent radicals\nof such parabolic subgroups, and of\n\u2013 suitable inclusions between such intersections.\nAccordingly, the language of root systems occupies a central stage in 3.4-5.\nTo conclude the proof of 2) we use standard specialization arguments in the context\nof the mentioned global deformations (cf. 1.2.1; see 3.7.1 and 3.7.6).\n1.2.1.1. Variants and complements. For a simpler way of proving a) and c)\nof Theorem 1 see 3.4.14. See also the last sentence of 1.4.1 for a third approach. For\nthe sake of completeness and of future references, 3.4-5 handle as well with full details\nthe cases of Shimura Lie \u03c3-crystals (see def. 2.2.11) which are not attachable to some\nShimura \u03c3-crystals (like the ones involving the E6 and E7 Lie types, etc.).\nThe first group of basic results and their proofs are presented in 3.1-5 and 3.7, while\n3.8 shows that Theorem 1 remains true even if G is just a reductive group (i.e. it is not\nnecessarily quasi-split). The construction of the global deformations mentioned in 1.2.1\nis carried out in 3.6, being in fact part of the second group of basic results.\n1.2.1.2. On the organization of 2.2. In 2.2 we present basic facts pertaining to\nShimura (adjoint) (filtered) (Lie) (\u03c3- or F -) crystals; most of them are indispensable for\nthe reading of \u00a73-4 (and so of 3.1-5). Special attention is paid to the Lie context (see\nthe first paragraph of 2.2.3 4) for a justification): see 2.2.2-3, 2.2.4 B, 2.2.8 b), 2.2.11-13,\n2.2.16.5, 2.2.23 B, etc. The notion of Shimura p-divisible groups (these are p-divisible\ngroups endowed with a family of crystalline \u2013de Rham\u2013 tensors and satisfying an axiom\ninspired from the axioms of 1.1) is introduced in 2.2.20. See 2.2.22 (resp. 2.2.23) for some\n9\n\n\fcomplements on Shimura (Lie) \u03c3-crystals (resp. on quasi-polarizations); in particular,\n2.2.22 3) deals with different classification problems.\n1.2.2. A supplement to 1.2.0. We have (cf. 3.9.2) the following important\nsupplement to 1.2.0:\nTheorem 2. A Shimura \u03c3-crystal (M, \u03c6, G) is a G-ordinary \u03c3-crystal iff for any\ng \u2208 G(W (k)), the Lie stable p-rank of (M, g\u03c6, G) is smaller than or equal to the Lie\nstable p-rank of (M, \u03c6, G).\nIn particular, any Shimura \u03c3-crystal (M, g\u03c6, G) having the same Lie stable p-rank as\na G-ordinary \u03c3-crystal (M, g1 \u03c6, G), is a G-ordinary \u03c3-crystal itself. Theorem 2 represents\nthe generalization of the characterization of ordinary p-divisible groups over k in terms of\np-ranks of Hasse\u2013Witt maps or matrices: we get Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Hasse\u2013Witt (reduced\nor adjoint) maps and matrices \"encoding\" the values of these Lie stable p-ranks (cf. 3.4.5,\n3.9.1, 3.9.6, 4.3.7 and 4.3.9; see also 3.13.7.6 for their non-compact variant). The essence\nof its proof is 3.5. The \u03c3-linear endomorphism F SHW der (resp. F SHW ad ) of 1.2.1.0, is\nthe most elementary sample of a Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Hasse\u2013Witt map (resp. adjoint map);\nthe dimension over k of its stable image is nothing else but the multiplicity of the slope\n\u22121 of the isocrystal (Lie(G)[ p1 ], \u03c6). Such maps can be defined as well in global contexts\n(like when k gets replaced by some regular, formally smooth k-scheme Sk and we deal\nwith a suitable F -crystal with tensors \u2013see 2.2.10 for samples\u2013 over Sk ).\nWe can refer to Lie stable p-ranks as well as Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Hasse\u2013Witt invariants. As we speak about Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Hasse\u2013Witt maps as well as (see 1.6.1) stratifications, and as in more general contexts (like of the class CL3 of 1.2.9), there is a\ndemarcation between the two (see 3.13.7.9 for some explanations), to be short and to\navoid confusion, in \u00a71-14, in connection to Shimura Lie \u03c3-crystals we refer just to Lie\nstable p-ranks of them.\n1.2.2.1. A mod p interpretation. Theorem 2 implies: the fact that (M, g\u03c6, G) is\nor is not G-ordinary depends only on the expression of g mod p (cf. 3.9.3). See 3.13.7.1.2\nfor a more of a principle formulation of this, closer in spirit to the classical context of\nSerre\u2013Tate's (ordinary) theory; so 3.13.7.1.2 represents the generalization of the following\nwell known result: the fact that a p-divisible group D over k is ordinary or not can be\nread out from its maximal subgroup D[p] annihilated by p.\n1.2.3. The list of principles. In section 3.6 we start the presentation of twelve\nfundamental principles of the crystalline theory. These principles are:\nPR1 the \u2207 principle (cf. 3.6.1.3, 3.6.18.4 and 3.6.18.6 a); see also 3.6.18.4.4 1) and\n3.6.18.9);\nPR2 the moduli principle (cf. 3.6.1.3 1) and 3.6.18.4.2);\nPR3 the surjectivity principle (cf. 3.6.1.3 5), 3.6.8.1.2 a), 3.6.8.2, 3.6.18.4.5 and\n3.6.18.6 b));\nPR4 the uniqueness principle (cf. 3.6.1.2, 3.6.18.8 and 3.6.18.8.1);\n10\n\n\fPR5 the (very) (weak) gluing principle (cf. 3.6.2.2 and 3.6.19);\nPR6 the integrability principle (cf. 3.6.18.4.1 and 3.6.18.4.1.1);\nPR7 the deformation principle (cf. 3.6.14 and 3.6.14.1-4);\nPR8 the boundedness principle (cf. 3.15.7; see also 1.6.3);\nPR9 the purity principle (cf. 3.6.8.1.4, 3.15.10 and 4.5.16.1);\nPR10 the (local) integral Manin problems (cf. a great part of 4.12);\nPR11 the invariance principle (cf. 4.13 and \u00a79-10);\nPR12 the slice principle (cf. \u00a77).\nThese principles are accompanied by eight other useful properties:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nthe\nthe\nthe\nthe\nthe\nthe\nthe\nthe\n\nconstructibility property (cf. 3.6.8.1.2 b));\nconstancy property (cf. 3.6.8.9);\ntouching property (cf. 3.6.18.4.3);\ninducing property (cf. 3.6.18.5);\nliftability property (cf. 3.6.18.5.2, 3.6.18.5.4 1) and 3.6.18.5.9);\ninductive property (cf. 3.9.7.2);\nhomomorphism property (cf. Corollary of 3.15.8);\nrigidity property (cf. \u00a77; see also 3.6.1.4 5) and 3.13.5.4).\n\n3.6.18.4-6 can be extended to a relative situation (i.e. to a situation where a smooth\ngroup \u2013not necessarily reductive\u2013 is involved, as in the context of 1.1): see the whole of\n3.6.18.7. It would be too long to fully describe these principles (or properties) here. So\nwe concentrate in outlying some of the main features.\n1.2.4. The first three principles in a convenient Shimura \u03c3-crystal con\u2207\ntext. For the definition of Fontaine categories MF[0,1] (X) and MF[0,1]\n(X), of their\np-divisible objects and for how (p-divisible) objects are pulled back through pro-\u00e9tale,\naffine morphisms see 2.1, 2.2.1 c) and respectively 3.6.1.1.1 1), 2) and 5). Here X stands\nfor a regular, formally smooth, affine W (k)-scheme such that either itself or its p-adic\ncompletion is endowed with an arbitrary (but fixed) Frobenius lift compatible (see 2.1)\nwith \u03c3; we always assume that the sheaf \u03a9Xk /k on Xk of relative differentials is locally\nfree of finite rank. Though in this introduction we deal just with such an X, it is worth\npointing out that in many situations X can be non-affine. For instance, when we are\n\u2207\ndealing with MF[0,1]\n(X), X can be non-affine and moreover we do not need to assume\nthat a Frobenius lift is specified (cf. 2.2.1 c)).\nWe come back to 1.1. Let U = Spec(R) be an open, affine subscheme of G such that\nthe identity element a0 of G(W (k)) belongs to U (W (k)). We assume the existence of an\n\u00e9tale morphism U \u2192 Spec(W (k)[x1 , ..., xd(G)]), where d(G) is the relative dimension of\nG, such that a0 factors through the closed subscheme of U defined by xi = 0, i = 1, d(G);\nhere we identify naturally each xi with an element of R. Let R\u2227 be the p-adic completion\nof R and let \u03a6R be the Frobenius lift of U \u2227 := Spec(R\u2227 ) which at the level of rings\n11\n\n\ftakes xi (identified naturally with an element of R) into xpi , \u2200i \u2208 {1, ..., d(G)}, and is\ncompatible with \u03c3 (for the case of a general type Frobenius lift \u03a6R compatible with \u03c3\nsee 3.6.18.8.3). Let MU be the p-divisible object of MF[0,1](U ) defined by the triple\n(M \u2297W (k) R\u2227 , F 1 \u2297W (k) R\u2227 , \u03a6MU ).\nHere \u03a6MU is the \u03a6R -linear endomorphism of M \u2297W (k) R\u2227 which takes an element m \u2208 M\ninto u(\u03c6(m)), with u \u2208 G(R\u2227 ) as the universal element naturally defined by the inclusion\nU \u0592\u2192 G. So \u03a6MU (t\u03b1 ) = t\u03b1 , \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 J . m and t\u03b1 's are viewed naturally as tensors of the\ntensor algebra of (M \u2295 M \u2217 ) \u2297W (k) R\u2227 [ p1 ] and \u03a6MU acts in the standard way (see 2.1) on\nthis tensor algebra.\nThe \u2207, the moduli and the surjectivity principles in their simplified and convenient\nform involving Shimura \u03c3-crystals can be formulated as follows (cf. 3.6.1.3):\nTheorem 3. There is a pro-\u00e9tale, affine morphism l : U1 = Spec(R1 ) \u2192 U , with\nthe special fibre of U1 a geometrically connected k-scheme, such that:\na) The pull back MU1 of MU to (the p-adic completion of ) U1 , is a p-divisible object of\n\u2207\nMF[0,1]\n(U1 ). In other words (cf. 3.6.1.1.1 2)), there is a unique connection\n\u2207 : M \u2297W (k) R1\u2227 \u2192 M \u2297W (k) \u03a9R/W (k) \u2297R R1\u2227\nfor which the Frobenius endomorphism \u03a6MU1 of M \u2297W (k) R1\u2227 (defined by \u03a6MU ; the\nFrobenius lift of R1\u2227 being the one naturally induced from \u03a6R via l) is \u2207-parallel\n(in the usual sense); \u2207 is integrable and nilpotent mod p. Moreover, \u2207 respects the\nG-action (i.e. we have \u2207(t\u03b1 ) = 0, \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 J );\nb) There is a closed subscheme B of the special fibre Uk of U not containing the origin\nof Gk , with the property that the fibres of l above points of Uk \\ B are non-empty.\nFrom Theorem 3 and [Fa1, 7.1] we deduce the existence of a p-divisible group D1\nover Spec(R1\u2227 ) corresponding (via the antiequivalence of loc. cit. applied in the context\n\u2207\nof a suitable projective system) to this p-divisible object of MF[0,1]\n(U1 ) (cf. 3.6.2.0; see\nalso b) of the Fact of 3.6.19). As \u2207 annihilates t\u03b1 , \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 J , the pair D1 := (D1 , (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J )\nis a Shimura p-divisible group.\nIn their full form, the above three principles in the context of MU and \u03a6R describe\nas well how we can choose l to get an universal property and what extra properties it\nenjoys (subject to this special choice).\n1.2.5. The essence of the second group of basic results: the first six\nprinciples. For the sake of generality, we now describe PR1-6 in wider contexts (then\nthe one of 1.2.4). Let X be as in 1.2.4. The \u2207 principle for an arbitrary object C of\nMF[0,1](X) shows the existence, in the \u00e9tale topology of X (i.e. when we pass to an \u00e9tale,\naffine morphism X \u2032 \u2192 X, surjective mod p), of connections on the pull back CX \u2032 of C to\nX \u2032 ; such connections satisfy all equations except the ones referring to the integrability\npart (see 3.6.1.1.1 1), 2) and 4)) needed to be satisfied in order that CX \u2032 is obtainable\n12\n\n\f\u2207\nfrom an object of MF[0,1]\n(X \u2032 ) by forgetting its connection. It also computes the number\n\u2207(C) of connections on C (in the case when the special fibre of X is a local strictly\nhenselian scheme), cf. 3.6.18.4.4 1), and expresses upper bounds for this number (in the\ngeneral case), cf. 3.6.18.9.\nThe \u2207 principle for a p-divisible object C of MF[0,1] (X) shows the existence of\nsuch connections in the pro-\u00e9tale topology of X (i.e. when we pass to a pro-\u00e9tale, affine\nmorphism X \u2032 \u2192 X, surjective mod p) and (under some conditions on X; see b) of Fact of\n3.6.19 and see 3.15.4 for some extensions of it) asserts (via the integrability principle to\nbe mentioned below) the existence of a p-divisible group DX \u2032 over the p-adic completion\nX \u2032\u2227 of X \u2032 whose associated filtered F -crystal, when viewed just as a p-divisible object\nof MF[0,1] (X \u2032 ) (i.e. when viewed without connection), is the pull back of C to X \u2032 ; to\nbe consistent with 1.2.4, X \u2032\u2227 is viewed here as an affine scheme. In many cases the\nuniqueness of DX \u2032 is implied by [Fa1, 7.1] (see b) of Fact of 3.6.19); when loc. cit. does\nnot apply, we rely on the fully faithfulness results of [BM, \u00a74] and the deformation theory\nof [Me, ch. 4-5] in order to get more general uniqueness statements (see 3.15.2-4).\nRegardless of C being an object or a p-divisible object, the \u2207 principle also describes\nhow such an X-scheme X \u2032 can be obtained: always Xk\u2032 is an affine Xk -scheme of a very\nparticular type. To detail this we work locally in the Zariski topology of Xk . So we\nconsider the context in which C is a p-divisible object, \u03a9Xk /k is a free sheaf on Xk and\nthe underlying sheaf of C (see defs. of 2.2.1 c)) is as well free. We have (cf. 3.6.18.4.2 b)\nfor the mod p part):\n\nKey Property. Xk\u2032 is the projective limit of schemes Xm , m \u2208 N, where Xm is\nobtained from Xm\u22121 (with X0 := Xk ) by using a quasi Artin\u2013Schreier system of equations\n(in a number of variables which does not depend on m), while X \u2032 itself is obtained as a\nprojective limit of schemes by just lifting what we get mod p.\nThese systems of equation (cf. the terminology of 3.6.18.4.6 A; they are also called of\nfirst type, cf. 3.6.8.9) are systems of n equations in n variables x1 ,..., xn with coefficients\nin an Fp -algebra R(p), of the form\n(1)\n\nxi = Li (xp1 , ..., xpn),\n\ni \u2208 {1, ..., n}, where Li 's are linear forms (not necessarily homogeneous). Here n \u2208 N.\nAny such system of equations defines naturally an \u00e9tale, affine Spec(R(p))-scheme (see\n3.6.8.1.2 a)).\nThe uniqueness principle tells us when the number \u2207(C) is 1. There are two forms\nof it: one in terms only of the Frobenius lift of X (or of its p-adic completion) (see\n3.6.18.8) and another one in terms only of the Frobenius endomorphism of (the underlying\nsheaf of) C (see 3.6.18.8.1 a)). The integrability principle asserts that all connections,\nwhose existence is asserted by the \u2207 principle, are in fact integrable. The ideas involved\nin obtaining it rely on a natural algebraization process (which allows us \u2013via Chinese\nRemainder Theorem\u2013 to perform suitable global deformations to a generic \u2013i.e. ordinary\u2013\ncontext) and on the touching property; they can be easily grasped from 3.6.18.4.1. These\n13\n\n\flast two principles together with the inducing property of 3.6.18.5 form a natural extension\nof [Fa2, th. 10].\nThe moduli principle shows the existence of a moduli formal scheme of connections\n(satisfying the equations mentioned in the first paragraph of 1.2.5) on (pull backs of)\nan arbitrary object or p-divisible object C of MF[0,1](X). One form of the surjectivity\nprinciple asserts that, in the case of a p-divisible object C, any connected component of\nthe special fibre of a such resulting moduli formal scheme, maps onto an open, dense\nsubscheme of a connected component of the special fibre of X (cf. 3.6.18.4.5).\nThe gluing principle has many variants (cf. 3.6.19). One such variant shows that in\nmany cases two filtered F -crystals (which are \"modeled\" on Shimura p-divisible groups)\nover the (assumed to be connected) special fibre Yk of a separated, smooth W (k)-scheme\nY , under some conditions which make them to look similar \"around\" a k-valued point y\nof Y and modulo logical changes of filtrations, are isomorphic over a connected Yk -scheme\nwhich is the special fibre of a pro-\u00e9tale, affine morphism Y1 \u2192 Y whose image contains\nan open, dense subscheme of Yk and to which y lifts.\n1.2.5.1. Some ideas. The guiding main new idea for obtaining these principles: we\nwork inductively mod pn , n \u2208 N (even in the case of a regular ring of formal power series\nover W (k)). What we gain by doing this: the systems of equations we get (as in 1.2.5,\nby working locally in the Zariski topology of Xk ) are of a very simple and practical form\n(for instance, see 3.6.8; see also the simple, independent Fundamental Lemma 3.6.8.1,\nwhose proof is based on intersection theory).\nUsing a subclass of quasi Artin\u2013Schreier systems of equations (i.e. the class of the\nso called Artin\u2013Schreier systems of equations) with coefficients in Fp -algebras, we define\nArtin\u2013Schreier fundamental groups (of different levels) of Fp -algebras whose spectra are\nconnected (see 3.6.18.4.6 A and B). See 3.6.18.4.6 C and D for the Fundamental Lemma\nof the \u03c01 -theory in positive characteristic.\nThe idea behind the surjectivity principle is the constancy property: the quasi Artin\u2013\nSchreier systems of equations we get working with different powers of p are very close (in\nshape) one to another, i.e. they differ, cf. 3.6.8.9, only by adding some constants to the\nlinear forms involved (so the abstract surjectivity principle of 3.6.1.8.2 a) applies). For an\napplication of 3.6.8.1 to difference systems of equations see 3.6.8.1.1. We view 3.6.8.1.2\nc) and part of 3.6.8.1 as the purely algebraic analogue of the well known theorem of S.\nLang on connected algebraic groups over finite fields.\n1.2.6. Some details on the contents of 3.9-10 and 3.12-14. In 3.9.4-5 we\npresent the notion of refined Lie stable p-rank of a Shimura \u03c3-crystal (M, \u03c6, G) and a\ntheorem for it similar to Theorem 2. The idea behind this is: for each factor of the\nadjoint group Gad of G whose generic fibre has a Lie algebra normalized by \u03c6, we can\ndefine a Lie stable p-rank; so the \"refined\" part refers to the fact that we keep track of\nall these Lie stable p-ranks and not only of a particular sum of them. Strictly speaking,\nin 3.4-5 we just deal with Lie stable p-ranks associated to a fixed such factor of Gad (see\ntheir parts referring to I0 of 3.4.0).\n14\n\n\fIn 3.10 we introduce the terminology (and notion) of cyclic Shimura (adjoint) Lie\n\u03c3-crystals to be constantly used, as well as logical formulas (see 3.10.6-7) for them.\n \u0303 (deIn 3.12 we show that for many Shimura filtered F -crystals (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G, H, f)\nfined in 2.2.10; so H is a smooth subscheme of G such that H(W (k)) contains a0 of 1.2.4),\nthe Shimura \u03c3\u03bd -crystal over the algebraic closure \u03bd of the field of fractions of the completion of the special fibre of H in the special fibre of a0 , is a GW (\u03bd) -ordinary \u03c3\u03bd -crystal\n(here \u03c3\u03bd is the Frobenius automorphism of W (\u03bd)). 3.12.1 is an immediate consequence\nof d) of Theorem 1 and of (restatement 2.2.21 UP of) [Fa2, rm. iii) after th. 10].\nBy a lift of a Shimura \u03c3-crystal (M, \u03c6, G) we mean a direct summand F 1 of M such\nthat the quadruple (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G) is a Shimura filtered \u03c3-crystal. Our hopes for a good\n(understandable and useful) theory of lifts of Shimura \u03c3-crystals (M, \u03c6, G) which are not\nG-ordinary (or are not potentially cyclic diagonalizable; see defs. 2.2.1 d) and 2.2.22 1))\nare gathered in 3.13: we define different (too many to be itemized) deviations of Shimura\n(filtered) (Lie) \u03c3-crystals. Here deviations are thought as measures of how far (or close)\na Shimura \u03c3-crystal is from being G-ordinary or potentially cyclic diagonalizable. We\ndraw attention to Conjecture 3.13.3.1 3) and to Problem 3.13.4 7).\nThe case p = 2 is treated in 3.14: with very few exceptions (all of them are explicitly\nitemized), everything we get for p \u2265 3 remains true for p = 2 without any significant\nmodification. In particular, Theorems 1, 2 and 3 remain true for p = 2. With p \u2265 3,\n3.5.4 a) is a well known statement on standard sl2 -subalgebras of the Lie algebra of a\nsemisimple group SG over k\u0304 which has a simple adjoint; it plays an important role in the\nproofs of 3.5. Unfortunately it is not true in general for p = 2. However, for p = 2 one\ngets around this problem by using any one (the choice depends on the context and so on\nSG) of the following three things (see 3.14 C; see also Step 2 of 3.13.7.3 and 3.14 J):\na) a slightly more involved argument pertaining to root systems;\nb) reduced structures of some normalizing group schemes over k\u0304 in order to make\nthem smooth;\nc) the classification of SG's for which 3.5.4 a) does not hold.\n1.2.7. Some conclusions and Dieudonn\u00e9's theories. Some conclusions (with\np \u2265 2) obtained by combining the basic results of 3.1 and 3.6, are included in 3.15 (see\nalso 3.1.8); they are detailed below and in 1.6.3-4. Some of them are refined in \u00a74 (like\nTheorem 1 of 3.15.1 is refined \u2013see Theorem 13 of 1.12\u2013 in 4.12.12 and 4.12.12.2).\nIn different parts of \u00a73, we reobtain many well known results of crystalline Dieudonn\u00e9\ntheories over (special fibres of) regular, formally smooth W (k)-schemes; moreover, in\nmany situations we weaken \u2013see below\u2013 the often used restriction on such special fibres\nto be locally of finite type, as well as in many situations we work in a context involving\nfinite, flat, commutative group schemes of p-power rank instead of one of (truncations\nof) p-divisible groups. For samples, see 3.6.18.5.1, 3.6.18.5.3, 3.6.18.5.7-8, Fact of 3.6.19,\n3.6.20 3), 3.14 B and 3.15.2-3. To our knowledge, some results are new; like 3.15.2 (and\nits variants referred to in 3.15.3 3) and 6) and in 3.15.4). The idea behind 3.15.2 is the\nmoduli principle; so, though a major result, it is not stated explicitly in this introduction.\nHere, in connection to these theories we just mention:\n15\n\n\f\u2022 In 3.6.20 3) and 3.15.3 4) we show that (for p \u2265 3) the results [Fa1, 7.1] and [Fa2,\nth. 10] can be deduced one from another (to our knowledge this is the first time when\nglobal Dieudonn\u00e9 theories \u2013like [Fa1, 7.1]\u2013 are used to get local ones \u2013like [Fa2, th. 10]\u2013;\nusually the implications go the other way round, see [dJ2] and the proof of Theorem 2 of\n3.15.1);\n\u2022 In 3.6.20 3), in 3.14 B6-8, in the proofs of the two Theorems of 3.15.1 and in 3.15.3\n3) and 6) we make the connection with [dJ1-2];\n\u2022 The new ideas we introduce are based on (a more systematic use of) the theory of\nprojective systems of (quasi-coherent sheaves on) schemes (see [EGA IV, \u00a78]) and on some\nof the first six principles of 1.2.3. So some of the results are proved in wider contexts,\nlike the ones involving pro-\u00e9tale morphisms or finite, flat, commutative group schemes\nof p-power rank; moreover, we are stating everything in terms (i.e. in the language)\nof Fontaine categories (even when we deal with the special fibre of a regular, formally\nsmooth W (k)-scheme; see 3.14 B6 for a sample): see 2.2.1.0 for Dieudonn\u00e9's crystalline,\ncontravariant functor in the language of such categories.\nMany of the ideas presented in \u00a71-4, can be easily adapted to wider contexts, which\nare either not necessarily regular, formally smooth (cf. 3.6.20 4)) or are involving a (nonperfect) field having a finite p-basis (cf. 3.15.3 6) and 3.15.4.1); as our work on p-divisible\ngroups emerged from the smooth context of a standard Hodge situation (see 1.3), these\nextensions are just very partially exploited here.\n1.2.8. On the context of 3.11. The special features of the case k = k\u0304 and some\nof their applications are presented in 3.11. Using defs. 2.2.1 d), 2.2.22 1) and 2.2.12, we\nhave (cf. also 2.2.9 6)):\nTheorem 4. If k = k\u0304, then all G-canonical lifts (M, F 1 , g\u03c6, G) (g \u2208 G(W (k)))\nare isomorphic to each other (under isomorphisms defined by elements of G(W (k))), are\ncyclic diagonalizable and their Shimura filtered Lie \u03c3-crystals are cyclic diagonalizable\nand of Borel and parabolic type.\nIn particular, if k = k\u0304 there is a W (k)-basis {ei |i \u2208 B(M )} of M and a permutation\n\u03c0 of the set B(M ), such that\ng\u03c6(ei ) = p\u03b5i e\u03c0(i) ,\nwhere \u03b5i is 1 or 0 depending on the fact that ei is or is not in F 1 . All proofs of Theorem\n4 presented (or mentioned) in 3.11.1 are in essence based on 1.2.1.0 3) and on properties\nof parabolic subgroups of G which allow us to use the fact (see 3.6.8.1) that quasi Artin\u2013\nSchreier systems of equations with coefficients in k have always solutions. If G = GL(M )\nthen we can assume \u03c0 is the trivial permutation (cf. 3.1.1.1).\nUsing Theorem 4, we get (see 3.1.4 and 3.11.2 A) that for any G-ordinary \u03c3-crystal\n(M, \u03c6, G), there is a unique cocharacter \u03bc : Gm \u2192 G as in 1.1 ii) and such that the\nelements of the parabolic Lie subalgebra of Lie(G) corresponding to non-negative (resp.\nto non-positive) slopes of (Lie(G), \u03c6) take F 1 (resp. F 0 ) into itself; it is referred as\nthe canonical split of (M, \u03c6, G). It is the inverse of the canonical split cocharacter of\n16\n\n\f(M, F 1 , \u03c6, G) as defined in [Wi], cf. 3.1.5. Useful direct sum decompositions (in the \u00e9tale\ncontext with Zp -coefficients or in the integral crystalline context) can be found in 3.11.8.1\n(see also 3.11.9).\n1.2.9. General Fontaine categories.

Such categories were first used in [FL] (resp. in [Fa1]) for the case when X = Spec(W (k)) (resp.\nwhen X is smooth over W (k) and either it is affine or we are in situations in which, based\non gluings arguments as in [Fa1, proof of 2.3], we do not need to specify a Frobenius lift).\nHere we just point out four things.\nFirst, we define a wide (and wild) variety of (subcategories of) Fontaine categories (of\nobjects of or p-divisible objects): see 2.2.1.7 for a glimpse. Different tannakian considerations are gathered in 2.2.4. In particular, we draw attention to the list of \u03c01 -groupoids\nof 2.2.4 J. They are of interest among themselves. Moreover, they also form the first\nattempt to:\n\u2013 define (quotients of) crystalline fundamental groupoids (and so indirectly groups)\nwith integral coefficients, and to\n\u2013 (simultaneously) work as well in other contexts.\nWe recall that previous works of Deligne (see [De6]) and others (more recently see\n[Shi1-2] and [HK]) were centered on a rational, unipotent context. Here, by \"other\ncontexts\" we mean contexts which do pay (at least partially) attention to reductive\n(group) aspects and by integral coefficients we mean Zp or W (k) coefficients (versus Qp\nor B(k)). We go as far as:\ni) to present some tools (which hopefully will be used later on and) which pertain\nto Fontaine categories (see all of 2.2.4);\nii) to define, without assuming that X or its p-adic completion has a Frobenius lift,\na category MF \u2207(p+tens) (X) which has most of the features one could think of (the still\nto be defined) category \"MF \u2207 (X)\" (see 2.2.4 C and D);\niii) to speak about tannakian categories and almost fibre functors over Wn (k), n \u2208 N\n(see ii) and 2.2.4 F);\niv) to define Fontaine's crystalline fundamental W (k)-groupoid of a proper, smooth,\ngeometrically connected W (k)-scheme (see 2.2.4 K);\nv) to define the crystalline fundamental W (k)-groupoid in crystals of the special\nfibre Xk of X (see 2.2.4.1 1));\nvi) and to include general affine versions of iv).\nSecond, most of the properties and principles we mentioned for MF[0,1](\u2217) in 1.2.4-5,\nare either not true (in general) or are true in a much weaker form for MF[a,b] (\u2217); this is\n17\n\n\fso due to the fact that working as usual modulo powers of p and following the approach\nof 1.2.5, we get systems of equations in n variables which besides the equations of (1) of\n1.2.5 do involve in general some extra equations (cf. 3.6.8.9; we refer to such systems of\nequations of being of third type).\nThird, some of the results have to be stated not in terms of multiplicities of the\nslopes 0 and 1 or of the slope \u22121 (as we usually do in the context of MF[0,1] (\u2217): see\n3.6.18.4, 3.6.18.7.0, etc.) but in terms of suitable pseudo-multiplicities of the slope \u22121,\nas defined in 3.6.18.5.5 B. The reason is: the liftability property referred to in 1.2.3 does\nnot hold (in general) in the context of MF[a,b] (\u2217).\nFourth, in the study of (truncations of) p-divisible objects of MF (W (k)) (see 2.2.1 c)\nfor defs.) endowed with some extra structures, we distinguish five major classes. Working\n(for simplicity of language) in a non-filtered context, they are listed below in such a way\nthat the next ones contain the previous ones:\n1) The class CL1 of Shimura \u03c3-crystals;\n2) The class CL2 of generalized Shimura p-divisible objects over k (see 2.2.8 3) and\n4));\n3) The class CL3 of p-divisible objects with a reductive structure over k (see 2.2.8\n3a) and 4a));\n4) The class CL4 of \u03c3-S-crystals (see 3.6.1.5);\n5) The most general context (involving a non-necessarily smooth group scheme).\nThis division is based on degrees of complexities. A great part of the results of\n1.2.1-8 (pertaining to CL1 ) extend automatically to CL2 and even to CL3 or to CL4 .\nFor instance, this paper \"handles\" entirely CL2 (i.e. everything we get here for CL1 is\nobtained as well for CL2 ). For the (local and global) deformation theory in the context\nof CL2 we refer to 3.6.18.7.1 c), 3.6.18.7.3 C and 3.15.6. One might wonder (based on\nthe above use of the word entirely), why we do not treat CL2 and CL1 as just one class.\nWe have two reasons for this:\n\u2013 presently, in general, we do not have geometric interpretations for representatives\nof CL2 (like p-divisible groups, Verschiebung maps of them or the existence of integral\ncanonical models of Shimura varieties of preabelian type);\n\u2013 occasionally we prove results pertaining to CL2 by reduction to the context of CL1\n(like the integrability principle; see 3.15.6 D).\nMost of the ideas apply as well directly to CL3 ; however, in Step 1 of Appendix we\nstate the things only as far as all details are obviously the same as for CL2 . One think is\nworth mentioning: we do not present a deformation theory for CL3 ; however, such a theory can be substituted from many points of view (like \"smallest Newton polygons\") either\nby 3.6.6, 3.6.6.0 and Grothendieck\u2013Katz' specialization theorem or by [RR] (see Step 1\nof Appendix). For avoiding repetitions, some results pertaining to CL2 are stated just in\nStep 1 of Appendix, as refinements of results pertaining to CL3 . In connection to CL4\n18\n\n\f(resp. to CL5 \\ CL4 ) we refer to 3.6.1.6 and Appendix (resp. to 3.9.9). In 3.9.9 we construct quasi-versal (in the sense of 3.6.19 B) global deformations (over W (k)-schemes as\nin 1.2.1) in contexts provided by suitable quintuples (M, F 1 , \u03c6, H, G), with (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G)\nas in 1.1 and with H a closed (but not necessarily smooth), integral subgroup of G; in\nparticular, we get such global deformations for quasi-polarized p-divisible groups over\nW (k).\n1.3. Standard Hodge situations. For a better presentation of geometric applications (see \u00a74) of the basic results of \u00a73, we introduce in 2.3 the standard Hodge situation;\nit generalizes [Ko2, ch. 5].\n\u0001\nWe start with an injective map f : Sh(G, X) \u0592\u2192 Sh GSp(W, \u03c8), S of Shimura pairs.\nHere the pair (GSp(W, \u03c8), S) defines a Siegel modular variety, cf. [Va2, 2.5]. Let Z(p) be\nthe localization of Z with respect to the rational prime p \u2265 3.\nLet v be a prime of the reflex field E(G, X) dividing p and let O(v) be the localization\nof the ring of integers of E(G, X) with respect to v. We assume the existence of a Z(p) lattice L(p) of W which is crystalline well positioned for the map f with respect to v (cf.\n\u0001\ndef. 2.3.4; see also below). The triple f, L(p) , v is called a standard Hodge situation.\n\nLet Kp := {g \u2208 GSp(W, \u03c8)(Qp ) g(L(p) \u2297Z(p) Zp ) = L(p) \u2297Z(p) Zp }. The hypothesis\non L(p) first implies: L(p) is a good Z(p) -lattice with respect to f . This means (see\ndef. [Va1, 5.8.3]) that \u03c8 induces a perfect form L(p) \u2297Z(p) L(p) \u2192 Z(p) (i.e. the induced\nmap from L(p) into its dual L\u2217(p) is an isomorphism) and the Zariski closure GZ(p) of\nG in GSp(L(p) , \u03c8) is a reductive group over Z(p) . So Kp is a hyperspecial subgroup of\nGSp(W, \u03c8)(Qp ) and the intersection\nH := GSp(W, \u03c8)(Qp ) \u2229 Kp\n\nis a hyperspecial subgroup of G(Qp ).\nLet e \u2208 N be such that 2e = dimQ (W ). We choose a Z-lattice LZ of W such that\n\u03c8 induces a perfect form \u03c8 : LZ \u2297Z LZ \u2192 Z and L(p) = LZ \u2297Z Z(p) . Let (v\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J be a\nfamily of tensors in spaces of the form W \u2217\u2297n \u2297Q W \u2297n , with n \u2208 N and with W \u2217 as the\ndual of W , such that G is the subgroup of GSp(W, \u03c8) fixing v\u03b1 , \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 J . The choice of\nthe lattice LZ and of the family (v\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J allows the interpretation of Sh(G, X)(C) as the\nset of isomorphism classes of principally polarized abelian varieties over C of dimension\ne, carrying a family of Hodge cycles indexed by the set J and satisfying some additional\nconditions and level structures (cf. [Va2, 4.1]).\nIt is known (for instance, see [Va2, 3.2.9 and 4.1]) that the Z(p) -scheme M parameterizing isomorphism classes of principally polarized abelian schemes of dimension e over\nZ(p) -schemes, having level-N symplectic similitude structure for any N \u2208 N relatively\nprime to p, together with the canonical action of GSp(W, \u03c8)(Apf ) on it, is an integral\n\u0001\ncanonical model of Sh GSp(W, \u03c8), S /Kp . These structures and this action are defined\nnaturally \u2013see [Va2, 4.1]\u2013 via L. See 2.1 for the Q\u2013algebras Apf and Af .\nThe normalization N of the Zariski closure of Sh(G, X)/H in MO(v) is (cf. 2.3.3)\nthe integral canonical model of Sh(G, X)/H (or of Shimura quadruple (G, X, H, v); see\n19\n\n\f[Va2, 3.2.6] for the definition of these quadruples). Let k(v) be the residue field of v.\nThe universal principally polarized abelian scheme over M gives birth, by pull back, to\na principally polarized abelian scheme (A, PA ) over N , which we call special.\n1.3.1. A basic assumption. The crystalline well positioned property of L(p)\nfor the map f with respect to v also says: any point z \u2208 N (W (k)) gives birth to a\nprincipally polarized abelian scheme (A, pA ) over W (k) (obtained from (A, PA ) by pull\nback) endowed naturally with a family (w\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J of Hodge cycles such that the filtered\n1\n\u03c3-crystal (M, F 1 , \u03c6) (with M := Hcrys\n(A/W (k)), with \u03c6 as the \u03c3-linear endomorphism\n1\nof M and with F as the Hodge filtration of M defined by A) gets a natural structure\nof a \"not necessarily quasi-split\" Shimura filtered \u03c3-crystal (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G\u0303W (k) ). In other\nwords:\n(*) The subgroup\nof GL(M ) obtained by taking the Zariski closure of the subgroup of\n\u0001\nGL M [ p1 ] fixing the perfect alternating form pA : M \u2297W (k) M \u2192 W (k)(1) (induced\nby the polarization pA of the abelian variety A and still denoted by pA ) and the\nde Rham component t\u03b1 of w\u03b1 (this component is a tensor in the tensor algebra of\n(M \u2295 M \u2217 )[ p1 ] fixed by \u03c6, cf. the Corollary of 2.3.10), \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 J , is a reductive group\n(not a priori quasi-split) G\u0303W (k) over W (k).\nThere is a finite, nilpotent Galois cover Spec(W (k1 )) of Spec(W (k)) of index of\nnilpotency at most two and of a very particular type (see 2.3.9 b) and d)) such that\nG\u0303W (k1 ) is isomorphic to GW (k1 ) . Moreover, for many standard Hodge situations we can\nshow (see 2.3.9 c)) that G\u0303W (k) is in fact automatically isomorphic to GW (k) . So, just for\nthe sake of convenience, we make the convention (see 2.3.9.2) that, without any extra\nreference, we consider from now on only points Spec(k) \u2192 N with the property that for\na (any) lift of it Spec(W (k)) \u2192 N , the reductive group over W (k) we get as in (*), is\n(isomorphic to) GW (k) and so is quasi-split. The proof of 2.3.9 uses Fontaine's comparison\ntheory, properties of reductive groups as well as a great part of [Va2, 6.4-6]. Based on this\nconvention, the triple (M, \u03c6, GW (k)) (resp. the quadruple (M, F 1 , \u03c6, GW (k) )) is called the\nShimura \u03c3-crystal (resp. the Shimura filtered \u03c3-crystal) attached to the point y \u2208 N (k)\ndefined by z (resp. attached to z). When we want to emphasize pA we also speak about\nthe principally quasi-polarized Shimura (resp. Shimura filtered) \u03c3-crystal attached to y\n(resp. to z). Notation: (M, \u03c6, GW (k) , pA ) (resp. (M, F 1 , \u03c6, GW (k) , pA )).\n1.3.1.1. Remark. (*) and the local deformation theory of [Va2, 5.4] imply (see\n2.3.11): for any regular, formally smooth W (k)-scheme \u0168 and for every morphism \u0168 \u2192\nN , we get naturally (via pull back) a principally quasi-polarized Shimura p-divisible\ngroup over \u0168 .\n1.3.2. The deformation principle. This principle in its essence says (cf. 3.6.14):\nTheorem 5. We consider a point y : Spec(k) \u2192 NW (k) . We assume that a starting\nassumption (see SA1 of 3.6.14) is satisfied for it. Then there is a smooth morphism\nN (y) \u2192 NW (k) and a pro-\u00e9tale morphism m1 : N (y)1 \u2192 N (y), with N (y)1 and affine\nscheme having a geometrically connected special fibre N (y)1k , such that:\n20\n\n\fa) Im(m1 ) contains an open, dense subscheme of N (y)k and y \u2208 m1 (N (y)1 (k)), and\nb) the principally quasi-polarized Shimura p-divisible group D 1 over the p-adic completion of N (y)1 , obtained by natural pull back (see 1.3.1.1), has a very nice (down to\nearth) expression.\nWhat we mean by b): D 1 is obtained by pulling back (through the p-adic completion\nof a pro-\u00e9tale morphism) the principally quasi-polarized Shimura p-divisible group D1\nover Spec(R1\u2227 ) produced entirely as in Theorem 3, but starting from the principally quasipolarized Shimura \u03c3-crystal attached to y (so here U is a suitable open subscheme of the\nsubgroup of GW (k) fixing the perfect alternating form pA on M ).\nWe get this principle by combining standard arguments with our approach of working inductively modulo powers of p; though lengthy, the proof of Theorem 5 is very\ninstructive. The starting assumption refers to the fact that, working mod p, the variant\nof Theorem 5, obtained by working with henselizations of localizations of smooth Nk schemes in k-valued points lifting y, is a priori satisfied. In practice it is very hard to\ncheck if a starting condition is satisfied or not. However the proof of Theorem 5 involves\nsome very important techniques and its variants modulo powers of p (see 3.6.14.4) involving no assumption, are also very useful for different local computations. Moreover,\nthe fact that a starting condition is satisfied or not, is at the very root of many extremely\nimportant problems (see \u00a75-8; see also 3.6.19 and the idea of 4.10.5).\nThere are variants of this principle: we work with a point yH0 : Spec(k) \u2192 NW (k) /H0\n(here H0 is a compact, open subgroup of G(Apf ) such that the quotient morphism N \u2192\nN /H0 is a pro-\u00e9tale cover and (A, PA ) descends to N /H0 ) or with an \u00e9tale morphism\nN (y) \u2192 NW (k) , cf. 3.6.14.1-3.\n1.4. Main geometric concepts. Starting from Theorem 1, we are able to\n\u2013 reobtain (see 4.6.1 3)) the well known results (pertaining to integral canonical\nmodels of Siegel modular varieties and to universal principally polarized abelian schemes\nover them) concerning the existence of an ordinary type and the existence of the canonical\nlift of a (principally polarized) ordinary abelian variety,\n\u2013 as well as to extend them to any integral canonical model N of a Shimura variety\nSh(G, X) of Hodge type and to every special principally polarized abelian scheme (A, PA )\nover N , arising (as in the end of 1.3) from a standard Hodge situation (f, L(p) , v).\nFor instance, with the notations of 1.3 we get the following three things.\na) First we get a Shimura-ordinary type \u03c4 (cf. 4.1). It depends only on f and v and\nnot on the choice of L(p) . It can be described as follows.\nThe isomorphism L(p) \u2192L\n \u0303 \u2217(p) induced by \u03c8 allows us to identify GZ(p) with a subgroup\nof GL(L\u2217(p) ). Let L\u2217p := L\u2217(p) \u2297Z(p) Zp ; so GZp is naturally a subgroup of GL(L\u2217p ). Let T\nbe a torus of GZp such that:\n1) there is a cocharacter \u03bc : Gm \u2192 TW (k(v)) which over an embedding of W (k(v)) in\nC (extending the composite inclusion O(v) \u2282 E(G, X) \u2282 C) is G(C)-conjugate to\n21\n\n\fthe cocharacters \u03bc\u2217x : Gm \u2192 GC , x \u2208 X, which are the cocharacters \u03bcx mentioned\nin [Va2, 2.2], but viewed in the dual context (so they are the cocharacters of GC\ndefining the Hodge Q\u2013structures on W \u2217 associated to points x \u2208 X);\n2) there is a Borel subgroup B of GZp containing T and whose Lie algebra is such that\nits elements take the F 1 -filtration F 1 of L\u2217p \u2297Zp W (k(v)) defined by \u03bc into itself.\nWe recall that \u03bc gives birth to a direct sum decomposition L\u2217p \u2297Zp W (k(v)) = F 1 \u2295F 0 ,\nwith \u03b2 \u2208 Gm (W (k(v))) acting through \u03bc on F i as the multiplication with \u03b2 \u2212i , i = 0, 1;\nso 2) can be restated as: b(F 1 ) \u2282 F 1 , \u2200b \u2208 Lie(B).\n\u03c4 is the formal isogeny type associated to the \u03c3-crystal over k(v)\n(L\u2217p \u2297Zp W (k(v)), \u03c6)\ndefined by \u03c6 := \u03c3 \u25e6 \u03bc( p1 ). Here \u03c3 acts as identity on L\u2217p and as Frobenius automorphism\n\u0002 \u0003\u0001\u0001\non W ((k(v)), while p1 \u2208 Gm W k(v) p1 . Due to 1) and the expression of \u03c6, the slopes\nof \u03c4 have as denominators divisors of the degree [k(v) : Fp ] (see 4.6 P4).\nb) Second we get G-ordinary (or Shimura-ordinary) points of Nk(v) (cf. 4.2). One\nway to define them: they are those points, with values in fields, which have the property\nthat the abelian varieties, obtained from A by pull backs via them, have \u03c4 as their formal\nisogeny type. They are dense in Nk(v) .\nc) Third we get G-canonical (or Shimura-canonical) lifts of G-ordinary points of\nNk(v) with values in perfect fields (cf. 4.4); they are uniquely determined (see 1.5).\nThese G-canonical lifts are points of N with values in Witt rings over perfect fields.\n1.4.1. On the passage from abstract to geometric contexts. 1.4 b) and c) are\na consequence of Theorems 1 and 2, via a natural algebraization process (see 2.3.15-16)\nof the local deformation theory of [Va2, 5.4]; this process is supported by:\n\u2013 the natural interpretation of loc. cit. in terms of filtrations (see 2.3.17; see also\n2.4 for an abstract presentation in the right context of PD-hulls);\n\u2013 Fontaine's comparison theory (it is the essence behind 4.2.3, for instance, cf. [Va2,\n5.2.17.2]);\n\u2013 and by a general Lemma (see 3.6.6) on Shimura \u03c3-crystals.\n\u03c4 is a usual ordinary type (i.e. it is the formal isogeny type e(1, 0) + e(0, 1); see 2.1)\nif and only if k(v) is Fp (cf. 4.6 P1: it is an immediate consequence of how \u03c4 is defined).\nIf k(v) = Fp , then the abelian variety over W (k) obtained from A by pull back through\nany W (k)-valued G-canonical lift of N , is the canonical lift of an ordinary abelian variety\n(cf. 4.6 P2: it is a consequence of 4.6 P1 and of b) of Theorem 1; cf. also 2.3.17).\nThe proof of 3.6.6 relies heavily on the language of root systems and of the classification mentioned in 1.2.1.0. In fact 3.6.6 (in the form of the Exercise 3.6.6.0) is from\nsome points of view equivalent to a) and c) of Theorem 1: see Step 1 of Appendix.\n22\n\n\f1.5. Shimura (filtered) Lie \u03c3-crystals attached to points. Let y : Spec(k) \u2192\nNk(v) . The Shimura Lie \u03c3-crystal (g, \u03c6) attached to the Shimura \u03c3-crystal attached to y,\nis also referred as the Shimura Lie \u03c3-crystal attached to y (cf. 2.3.10; see also 1.3.1); here\ng := Lie(GW (k) ). Similarly (see 4.3.1), we speak about the Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Hasse\u2013Witt\n(adjoint) map attached to y.\nAny lift z : Spec(W (k)) \u2192 N of y, makes (g, \u03c6) to be a filtered Lie \u03c3-crystal, i.e.\nit makes it to be a p-divisible object of MF[\u22121,1] (W (k)) endowed naturally with a Lie\nstructure. So we get a filtration\n0 = F 2 (g) \u2282 F 1 (g) \u2282 F 0 (g) \u2282 F \u22121 (g) = g\nsuch that\n\u03c6\n\n\u0001\n1 1\nF (g) + F 0 (g) + pg = g;\np\n\nF 0 (g) is a parabolic Lie subalgebra of g having F 1 (g) as its nilpotent radical, F 1 (g) is\nabelian and [g, F 1 (g)] \u2282 F 0 (g). We refer to the quadruple (g, \u03c6, F 0 (g), F 1 (g)) as the\nShimura filtered Lie \u03c3-crystal attached to z. a) of Theorem 1 implies (via 2.3.17): y is\na G-ordinary point iff there is a W (k)-valued point z of N lifting it and whose attached\nShimura filtered Lie \u03c3-crystal is of parabolic type. Such a lift z, when exists, is unique\n(cf. b) of Theorem 1 and 2.3.17) and defines the G-canonical lift of y.\nThe G-ordinary points of Nk(v) (resp. the G-canonical lifts of G-ordinary points)\nwith values in perfect fields have all usual properties of ordinary points (resp. of canonical\nlifts of ordinary points) of M with values in perfect fields, which can be read out from\nShimura (resp. Shimura filtered) Lie \u03c3-crystals attached to points of MFp with values\nin perfect fields (resp. in Witt rings of perfect fields). As samples of this philosophy\nsee 1.7-9 and 4.4.4. Of course, these properties have to be reformulated accordingly (if\nk(v) 6= Fp ).\n1.5.1. A new, more general concept: U -ordinariness. A natural question\narises: for which other k-valued point of Nk(v) we can (identify and) define naturally a\nlift of it to a W (k)-valued point of N , which is uniquely determined by some conditions?\nIn 4.4.13, as a digression, we answer partially this question: we define U -ordinary points\nand U -canonical lifts. The U -ordinary points of Nk(v) with values in k are those points\nwhose attached Shimura \u03c3-crystals have a unique lift of quasi CM type in the sense of\n2.2.17 (and so in particular are potentially cyclic diagonalizable): these unique lifts define\nthe U -canonical lifts. Any G-ordinary point is a U -ordinary point and any G-canonical\nlift is a U -canonical lift (see 4.4.13.3); but there are tremendously many examples of\nstandard Hodge situations for which we have (plenty of) U -ordinary points which are\nnot G-ordinary. These examples do not show up in the classical setting of M: they\ntypically show up when Gad\nQp has certain simple factors which are not absolutely simple.\nSee 4.4.13.3.1 for first examples, in the abstract context of Shimura (Lie) \u03c3-crystals. The\nsimplest concrete geometric examples can be obtained starting from 4.12.12.6.6 3).\n23\n\n\fThe passage from G-ordinary points to U -ordinary points is achieved via (see\n4.4.13.2): we move from keeping track of parabolic Lie subalgebras of Lie(GW (k) ) corresponding to non-negative slopes, to keeping track of Lie subalgebras (they are automatically reductive in the potentially cyclic diagonalizable context, cf. 2.2.19.1-2) of\nLie(GW (k) ) corresponding only to the slope 0; here slopes are with respect to some \u03c6 as\nin 1.3.1. When we are in the context of U -ordinary points and these last Lie subalgebras\nare abelian, we get a subclass of U -ordinary points which we call T -ordinary points. The\nG-ordinary points are just exceptionally T -ordinary points (see 4.6 P7).\nOur hopes for good (i.e. unique in some sense) lifts for other k-valued points of Nk(v)\nare expressed in question Q3 ) of 4.5.15.\n1.6. Stratifications. The Newton polygons of (isocrystals defined by) Shimura\nLie \u03c3-crystals attached to points of Nk(v) with values in perfect fields, achieve (cf. 4.5)\na stratification (called the canonical Lie stratification) of Nk(v) into G(Apf )-invariant,\nreduced, locally closed subschemes. It is similar (in nature and properties) to the well\nknown Newton polygon stratification of MFp .\nMore generally, for any representation\n\u03c1 : GZp \u2192 GL(N ),\nwith N a free Zp -module of finite rank, we define (via Newton polygons, see 4.5.4) a\n\u03c1-stratification of Nk(v) in G(Apf )-invariant, reduced, locally closed subschemes. The\nintersection of all these \u03c1-stratifications defines the absolute stratification. This absolute\nstratification is the most refined stratification of Nk(v) which can be obtained naturally\n(i.e. in an adequate Shimura context, involving representations of GZp ) with the help of\nNewton polygons. The \u03c1-stratification depends only on the restriction of \u03c1 to Gder\nQp (cf.\n4.5.6 9)); however, there is a lot of data lost if we consider just such restrictions (see end\nof 4.5.4 for a glimpse and see 1.15.1 for a general principle).\nIn particular, we also define (see 4.5.2) the refined canonical Lie stratification of\nNk(v) : it is the intersection of those \u03c1-stratifications which have \u03c1 as a subrepresentation\nad\nad\nof the adjoint representation of GZp on Lie(Gad\nZp ). If (G , X ) has all its simple factors\nof Cn type or of some particular Bn type, with n \u2208 N, then this stratification coincides\n(see 4.5.6.1) with the absolute stratification; but this is not necessarily true in general\n(see 4.5.6.2). The G-ordinary points of Nk(v) are points of the generic (i.e. dense) open\nstratum (it does not matter which stratification we use, cf. 4.5.6 8)).\n1.6.1. The (quasi-) ultra stratification. Warning: till 1.9.1 we assume k = k\u0304.\nA long list of other types of stratifications of Nk(v) is presented in 4.5.9 and 4.5.15. To\nexplain them let us start mentioning some main points.\n\u2022 Many of them are refinements of the absolute stratification of Nk(v) (see question\nQ2 ) of 4.5.15).\n\u2022 The most useful ones are the pseudo-ultra, the quasi-ultra (or the Faltings\u2013\nShimura\u2013Hasse\u2013Witt) and the ultra stratification (see 4.5.15.1).\n24\n\n\f\u2022 The quasi-ultra stratification is defined purely in terms of inner isomorphism classes\n(over algebraically closed fields) of Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Hasse\u2013Witt adjoint maps attached\nto points of Nk(v) with values in such fields, while the ultra stratification is defined\nas the intersection of the quasi-ultra and the absolute stratifications (it is 4.2.10 which\nallows us to speak about inner isomorphism classes; for instance, referring to the map\nF SHW ad and notations of 1.2.1.0, we allow only those isomorphisms between F SHW ad\nand ig \u25e6 F SHW ad , with ig as the inner automorphism of Lie(Gad )/pLie(Gad ) defined by\ng \u2208 Gad\nk (k), which are defined as well by such inner automorphisms).\n\u2022 In order to define these last two stratifications we either assume that the set of\nsuch inner isomorphism classes is finite (we expect \u2013see 4.5.15.1; see also 1.6.2\u2013 that this\nset is always finite, under no restrictions) or allow stratifications (they are formalized in\n2.1) with potentially an infinite number of strata.\n\u2022 The quasi-ultra stratification can be studied without using any Verschiebung map;\nits main properties can be listed as follows (see 3.13.7.1-7, 4.5.15.2 and 4.5.15.2.1-5 for\nmore details):\na) its strata are in one-to-one correspondence to a subset of the set of orbits of some\nalgebraic group action GA over the algebraic closure F of Fp : GA is constructed purely\nin terms of Gad\nFp and of the special fibre of the cocharacter \u03bc of 1.4 1) (in the abstract\ncontext, see T0 of 3.13.7.1); more precisely, the number of its strata is conjectured to\nbe the number of elements of the quotient set of the Weyl group W G of Gad\nF which\nparameterizes orbits of GA defined naturally by elements of W G (this can be grasped\nfrom 1.6.2; see 4.12.12.6 for why all elements of W G do show up);\nb) which stratum specializes to which stratum can be read out from GA (see end of\n4.5.15.2.1);\nc) all its strata are regular (this is a consequence of a) and of 2.3.15);\nd) the dimensions of its strata can be read out from GA; in particular, their codimensions are given by dimensions of automorphism groups of Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Hasse\u2013Witt\nadjoint maps attached to F-valued points of Nk(v) (again this is a consequence of 2.3.15);\ne) if f is an isomorphism (i.e. if N = M), it coincides with the canonical stratification as defined (for suitable quotients of MFp ) in [EO] (see also its published first\npreliminary version [Oo3]);\nf ) the quasi-affineness property of loc. cit. implies that all its strata are quasi-affine.\nSo the philosophy of the quasi-ultra stratification is:\nPh. Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Hasse\u2013Witt adjoint maps are the adjoint Lie analogue (in any\nrelative context pertaining to Shimura Lie \u03c3-crystals) of truncations mod p of p-divisible\ngroups over Fp -schemes.\nThe only thing we use in \u00a71-14 from [Oo3] (cf. the quasi-affineness part of f)), can\nbe in fact entirely avoided, cf. 4.9.17.0.0.\n25\n\n\f1.6.2. A main expectation. The main expectation on the precise number of\norbits of GA can be formulated (with the def. of 2.2.14) in an abstract context as follows\n(the notations are as in 1.1-2):\nExpectation (the CM level one property). For any Shimura \u03c3-crystal (M, \u03c6, G)\nover k, there is a lift F 1 of it such that the truncation mod p of (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G) is isomorphic, under an isomorphism defined by an element of G(k), to the truncation mod p of\n(M, F 1 , g\u03c6, G), where g \u2208 G(W (k)) is such that, for a maximal torus T of the parabolic\nsubgroup of G normalizing F 1 , the quadruple (M, F 1 , g\u03c6, T ) is a Shimura filtered \u03c3crystal.\nThis should be provable by slightly refining the proofs of 3.4.6 and 3.6.6, cf. 3.5.3-4\nand the way the group actions T and T0 of 3.13.7.1 are constructed. 3.13.7.2 makes the\nconnection between this Expectation and inner isomorphism classes of Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013\nHasse\u2013Witt adjoint maps. In 3.13.7.1 we develop some steps towards the proof of this\nExpectation: it gets reduced to checking that a Bruhat decomposition (naturally associated to (M, \u03c6, G)) holds for G(k), see 3.13.7.1.3-4. We do believe that such decompositions can be also checked abstractly, in an adequate \u03c3- or F -context pertaining to\nTits systems: see 3) of 3.13.7.4 D for a precise statement on such decompositions in the\nF -context for reductive groups. Here \"F -\" is used as in the Steinberg's reformulation of\nLang's theorem (see [Hu2, 8.3]).\nFor some extra reduction steps towards the proof of the existence of such decompositions (and so towards the proof of this Expectation), see 3.13.7.3-4, 3.13.7.6 and\n4.6.7-8. For the case when we are dealing with a reductive group whose adjoint has all\nits simple factors of A1 Lie type, such decompositions are proved to exist in 3.13.7.5.\nSee also 3.13.7.6.0 for how they can be used in connection to inner isomorphism classes\nof Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Hasse\u2013Witt adjoint maps which are \u03c3-linear endomorphisms of the\nLie algebra of an adjoint group over k of whose simple factors are all of A1 Lie type. In\nturns out that the mentioned A1 Lie type case is just a particular case of the so called\nessentially Borel subgroup case: see Corollary 2 of 3.13.7.5 and 3.13.7.8.2 for precise\nstatements and a description of such a case.\n1.6.2.1. Some generalizations. A great part of the theories of 1.6.1-2 can be redone in terms of (inner isomorphism classes of) truncations mod p of Shimura \u03c3-crystals\n(see 2.2.14 for defs.): see 4.5.15.2.4 3) for (geometric) justifications of why we still prefer the adjoint context. Despite this and the philosophy of 1.6.1, we view the refined\ncanonical stratifications hinted at in 4.5.9 as the right generalization of the canonical\nstratification of [EO]. If one wants, the quasi-ultra stratifications are the generalization\nof the generalized canonical stratifications. Motivation: they provide the right context\nwhich can be immediately extended to any geometric context involving p-divisible objects\nwith a reductive structure over k.\nIn other words, the abstract Expectation of 3) of 3.13.7.4 D has often significant and\nextremely important (adaptable to geometric) interpretations (similar to the ones of 1.6.1\nand referring to isomorphism classes) in the much wider context of CL3 : see 3.13.7.8 for\ndetails; see 3.13.7.8.1 for a very concrete example. See also [Va12] for geometric examples\n26\n\n\finvolving other classes of polarized varieties (like polarized K3 surfaces or cubic fourfolds,\netc.). Here we will just mention that in 2.2.14.2 we introduce Fontaine truncations:\nthey provide the right context for such extensions and interpretations, leading to the\nmost general possible Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Hasse\u2013Witt stratifications. See 3.13.7.9 for the\ngeneral form of Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Hasse\u2013Witt (all types of) maps. See also 3.13.7.8.3-4,\n4.5.15.2.4 3), 4.14.5 and Appendix for some extra useful aspects and comments.\n1.6.3. The boundedness principle and some new stratifications. In all\nthat follows we speak only about stratifications of Nk(v) and we allow them to have\nan infinite number of strata. Accordingly, till the end of 1.6.3 we take k = F and we\nconsider (see the conventions of 2.1) for the simplicity of language, only those strata\nwhich are locally closed subschemes of Nk(v) . In 4.5.16 and 4.9.9.1 we start a deep study\nof the ultra stratification of Nk(v) . We introduce two extra types of stratifications: the\nFaltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Dieudonn\u00e9 and the ultimate stratifications. Each one of these types\nhas three variants: adjoint, principal or standard; warning: most common we drop the\nword standard.\nThe Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Dieudonn\u00e9 principal stratification (resp. adjoint stratification) is the stratification of Nk(v) defined by (warning!) inner isomorphism classes of\nprincipally quasi-polarized Shimura \u03c3-crystals (resp. of Shimura adjoint Lie \u03c3-crystals)\nattached to k-valued points of Nk(v) . Related to the use of the word inner we mention\ntwo things. First, in the adjoint context it is 4.2.10 which allows us to speak about\ninner isomorphisms between Shimura adjoint Lie \u03c3-crystals attached to k-valued points\nof Nk(v) . Second, in the principally quasi-polarized Shimura \u03c3-crystals, the fact that\nthe subgroup of GW (k) fixing pA of 1.3.1 is connected (see the part of 2.3.3 referring\nto G0Zp ), we can speak about isomorphism classes of quadruples (M, \u03c6, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J , pA )\n(of elements) as in 1.3.1; they are referred as inner isomorphism classes of principally quasi-polarized Shimura \u03c3-crystals attached to k-valued points of Nk(v) . The\nFaltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Dieudonn\u00e9 (standard) stratification is defined similarly to the Faltings\u2013\nShimura\u2013Dieudonn\u00e9 principal stratification but without keeping track of principal quasipolarizations. The Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Dieudonn\u00e9 (standard or adjoint) stratification is\nG(Apf )-invariant (see Fact 6 of 2.3.11) and (cf. 4.9.9) invariant under the automorphism\ngroup Aut(G, X, H) (see 2.3.5.4 for a review on it). In many cases (like when the center of\nG is a torus and the connected components of Nk(v) are permuted transitively by G(Apf )),\nthe Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Dieudonn\u00e9 stratification and the Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Dieudonn\u00e9 adjoint stratification coincide but we are not able to list all cases when this happens. Also,\n) = \u22121, then they also coincide with\nif these last two stratifications coincide and if ( \u22121\np\nthe Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Dieudonn\u00e9 principal stratification; we do not know what to say\nif ( \u22121\n) = 1. See 4.5.16.0 2) for the last two sentences. Warning: the principal quasip\npolarizations (as pA at the end of 1.3.1) are viewed here as fixed cycles and not up to\nGm (Zp )-multiples (of such fixed cycles).\nThe ultimate stratification of Nk(v) is the G(Apf )-invariant, Aut(G, X, H)-invariant\nmaximal refinement of the Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Dieudonn\u00e9 stratification obtainable by decomposing its strata into open closed subschemes. One can define as well the ultimate\n27\n\n\fprincipal stratification of Nk(v) : we just have to replace G(Apf ) and Aut(G, X, H) by their\nmaximal subgroups leaving invariant the Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Dieudonn\u00e9 principal stratification; as we do not know how to compute these groups, in \u00a74 we do not mention it. For\ngetting nice functorial purposes (see end of 1.10.1), the ultimate adjoint stratification of\nNk(v) is obtained similarly (but slightly different) from the Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Dieudonn\u00e9\nadjoint stratification of Nk(v) ; see 4.9.9.1.\nSo the ultimate adjoint stratification is a refinement of the Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013\nDieudonn\u00e9 adjoint stratification, which is a refinement of the ultra stratification, which\nat its turn is a refinement of the quasi-ultra or of the absolute stratification. Also, there\nis nothing we can refine to the ultimate stratification, from any point of view pertaining\nto Shimura p-divisible groups attached to points of Nk(v) . These new two types of stratifications have one disadvantage: in general their number of strata is infinite; however,\nsee rm. 4.9.9.3. We have (cf. 4.5.16 and 4.5.16.1):\nTheorem 6 (the third form of the purity principle and a geometric form\nof the boundedness principle). The Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Dieudonn\u00e9 (principal) stratification is well defined, i.e. its strata are indeed reduced, locally closed subschemes of\n(suitable pull backs of ) Nk(v) . It satisfies the purity property (as defined in 2.1) and\neach stratum of it is regular, quasi-affine and all its connected components have the same\ndimension.\nWe have versions of this (see 4.5.16, 4.5.16.1, 4.9.9 and 4.9.9.1) for the Faltings\u2013\nShimura\u2013Dieudonn\u00e9 adjoint stratification or for the ultimate types of stratifications. The\nidea of the proof of Theorem 6 is very simple: its very essence is the Fundamental Lemma\n3.6.15 B. The simplest form of 3.6.15 B asserts that for any Shimura \u03c3-crystal (M, \u03c6, G)\nand for any h \u2208 G(W (k)), there is n \u2208 N such that (M, h\u03c6, G) and (M, gh\u03c6, G) are isomorphic under an isomorphism defined by an element e(h, g) of G(W (k)), \u2200g \u2208 G(W (k))\ncongruent to the identity mod pn . Its proof involves some fundamental techniques: in\ngeneral we can not choose e(h, g) to be congruent to the identity mod pn ; so in order\nto be able to use the fact that any quasi Artin\u2013Schreier system of equations with coefficients in k has a solution in k, we use the stairs method, i.e. we consider suitable\nW (k)-submodules of Lie(G) which (warning!) do not pay at all attention to the Lie\nstructure but are obtained using Dieudonn\u00e9's classification (see [Di] or [Man]) of isocrystals over k (so 3.6.15 B is true even in the context of CL5 ; see rm. 1) of 3.15.7 B). Simple\nestimates (see 3.15.7 C) show that n can be taken to be independent on h. This is the\nmain ingredient needed to get (via standard techniques of algebraic geometry) that the\nFaltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Dieudonn\u00e9 (principal) stratification of Nk(v) is well defined. The estimates of 3.15.7 C handle the most general context of (see 2.1) latticed isocrystals over\nk.\nThe essence of the above paragraph is presented as the boundedness principle in\n3.15.7. See 3.15.8 for the homomorphisms form of 3.6.15 B; it is based on the fact that\nwe can always choose e(h, g) to be congruent to the identity mod pn\u2212m , where (for n\nbounded below as in 3.6.15 B) m \u2208 N does not depend as well on h. Using it, we get\n(see 3.15.8) a new proof of \"Katz' open part\" of the Grothendieck\u2013Katz' specialization\n28\n\n\ftheorem.\nThe third form of the purity principle can be checked immediately using schemes of\nisomorphisms between two finite, flat, commutative group schemes over the same base.\nEven more, in 3.15.10 we show how the homomorphism form of 3.6.15 B can be used\nto get the second form of the purity principle, i.e. to get that all stratifications by\nNewton polygons defined by (see 2.1 for conventions on them) F -crystals in locally free\nsheaves of locally finite ranks over suitable Fp -schemes S, satisfy the purity property. This\nwas obtained previously under the hypothesis that S is locally noetherian in [dJO, 4.1].\nThe philosophy (which among other things allows a weakening of this local noetherian\nassumption; see 3.15.10 and 3.15.10.1 1) and 2)) is:\nPh. Newton polygons are entirely \"encoded\" in the existence of suitable morphisms\nbetween truncations modulo effectively computable (positive, integral and high) powers of\np of F -crystals in locally free sheaves of locally finite ranks.\nOur interest in Newton polygons is considerably reduced (cf. the Real Problem of\n1.6.5); so this second form of the purity principle is presented at the very end of \u00a73. It\nis worth pointing out that in 3.15.10 we use only tools which were already available in\nprint in 1979 (i.e. we use besides 3.6.15 B \u2013its proof uses the simplest type of quasi\nArtin\u2013Schreier systems of equations with coefficients in k which obviously have solutions\nover k\u2013 just [Ka2, 2.7.4]). One might wonder why it took 21 years to get [dJ0, 4.1] (and\nthat by using strong tools \u2013like alterations, overconvergent F -crystals, etc.). We think\nthe reason is: too little mathematical effort was put in connection to the Real Problem\n(according to us, most of what has been done previously from the rational point of view\n\u2013like Newton polygons, etc.\u2013 has to be redone entirely \u2013unfortunately, often starting from\nthe very scratch\u2013 from the perspective of the Real Problem).\nWe came across Theorem 6 being motivated by the integral Manin problem (see\n1.12), cf. 3.6.15 A. There is extremely few literature in connection to it. The most we\ncan say: [LO] has some material which can be used to have more computations performed\n(unfortunately, very little of loc. cit. can be adapted to the context of Shimura p-divisible\ngroups; moreover, loc. cit. can not be used in connection to CL2 , provided we are in a\ncontext involving the Shimura Lie \u03c3-crystals mentioned in 1.2.1.1). We refer to \u00a79-10 for\nour computations involving different stratifications we mentioned above. Warning: we\npresently have no reason to think that in general the ultimate (adjoint) and the Faltings\u2013\nShimura\u2013Dieudonn\u00e9 (adjoint) stratifications of Nk(v) coincide; [IKO, 2.10] is a nice result\npertaining to isomorphism classes of principal polarizations on products of supersingular\nelliptic curves over k, which tells us to be cautious in trying to identify these last two\n(adjoint) stratifications.\n1.6.4. The First Main Corollary. Theorem 6 and its abstract analogues represent, in our opinion, a turn in the study of (Shimura) p-divisible groups: we need to\nbuild up their \"libraries\" (i.e to list them). For instance, the following consequence of\n3.6.15 B tells us that it is possible to build an \"atlas\" for isomorphism classes of Shimura\np-divisible groups over F which are defined over a fixed finite field, similar to the well\nknown \"atlas\" for finite groups or to [Cr]. We have:\n29\n\n\fFirst Main Corollary. Let q \u2208 N. Let Fpq be the field with pq elements. The\nnumber D(r, d, q) of isomorphism classes of p-divisible groups of fixed rank r \u2208 N and\ndimension d \u2208 {0, ..., r} over k which are definable over Fpq is finite and does not depend\non k. Similarly, for any Shimura \u03c3-crystal over k, the number D(Cl(M, \u03c6, G), q) of\nelements of the class Cl(M, \u03c6, G) (see 2.2.22 2); it is a set formed by isomorphism classes)\ndefinable over Fpq is finite and does not depend on k.\nSee 3.15.7 G for concrete (though very gross) upper bounds for D(r, q) or for\n2\nD(Cl(M, \u03c6, G), q). For instance, we get D(r, q) \u2264 pqr h(r) , where h : N \u2192 N is an\neffectively (and easily) computable function.\n1.6.5. Grothendieck's specialization categories. Presently we have full control\non the Expectation of 1.6.2 for Shimura varieties of An , Cn or DnH Lie types (cf. 4.6.78). So, based on this and the last sentence of 1.6.4, in 4.9.9.2 we already introduce\nGrothendieck's (adjoint) specialization category of Nk (or of Nk(v) ) which keeps track of\nspecializations between strata of the ultimate (adjoint) stratification of Nk(v) ; some of\nthe most natural invariants associated to it are mentioned in 4.12.12.8. The philosophy\nbehind this category can be roughly summarized as follows.\nThe Real Problem. Let p \u2265 2. The real problem of the theory of Shimura pdivisible groups over some convenient perfect field k\u0303 (usually finite or algebraically closed)\nof characteristic p, is to list (often using families) their isomorphism classes and decide\nwhich such isomorphism classes specialize to which other. The same applies to the theory\nof p-divisible objects with tensors over k\u0303 (we mostly have in mind the context of CL3 but\nnot only).\nNot to make this paper too long, we include here extremely few applications of\nTheorem 6 (see \u00a79-11 for many such applications, cf. also 1.15.6). A last think: we have\na result similar to Theorem 6 in the abstract context of CL2 (see [Va6]; see also 3.15.6 D\nand E).\n1.6.6. (Refined) Artin\u2013Schreier stratifications. Each quasi Artin\u2013Schreier\nsystem of equations with coefficients in a reduced Fp -algebra R, defines naturally (based\non 3.6.8.1.2 a)) an Artin\u2013Schreier and a refined Artin\u2013Schreier stratification of Spec(R)\nin a finite number of strata, cf. 3.6.8.1.3. In 4.5.18, we extend these notions of types\nof stratifications to an arbitrary reduced Fp -scheme: examples (abstract as well as concrete ones pertaining to Nk(v) ) and comments are included. We draw attention to the\nConjecture of 4.5.18.1. It is related to the first form (pertaining to quasi Artin\u2013Schreier\nsystems of equations; see 3.6.8.1.4) of the purity principle: it conjectures that the second\nand third form of this principle are particular cases of its first form.\n1.6.7. Toric points. In 4.5.11 we enlarge the class of U -ordinary points: we\nintroduce toric points; the k-valued toric points of Nk(v) are defined by requiring that\ntheir attached Shimura \u03c3-crystals have lifts of quasi CM type, without imposing the\nuniqueness of such lifts.\n1.7. On the contents of 4.3 and 4.6. In 4.3 we restate 1.2.2 in the context of\na standard Hodge situation as in 1.3. We use refined Lie stable p-ranks: each simple\n30\n\n\ffactor of Gad\nZp can be used (cf. 4.2.10) to define (independent) Lie stable p-ranks of its\ncorresponding cyclic adjoint factors (see 3.10.1 for their definition) of Shimura \u03c3-crystals\nattached to points of Nk(v) with values in k.\nIn 4.6 we include some examples to illustrate the general theory presented in 4.1-5\nand to point out the complexities which are arising. One sample: in 4.6.1 1) we point\nout that it can happen that the formal isogeny type \u03c4 introduced in 1.4 does not have\nintegral slopes. We also list the main properties of the general theory; some particular\nsituations are also referred to (for instance, see 4.6 P11 for the case when the centralizer\nof G in GSp(W, \u03c8) is a 1 dimensional torus). As a simple and straightforward application\nof 1.4 b) and of [Va2, 5.8.6] we get a general principle concerning non-ordinary reductions\nof an abelian variety A over a number field E, with respect to primes of E:\nTheorem 7 (the non-ordinary reduction criterion). If the reflex field of the\nShimura variety defined naturally (see 2.1) by the Mumford\u2013Tate group of A, is not Q,\nthen A has a non-ordinary reduction with respect to an infinite number of primes of E.\nMoreover, there are very precise recipes of how \"to cook\" such primes (see 4.6.2.1; see\nalso 4.6.2.2).\n4.6.5-8 contain different complements meant to emphasize how complexities or simplifications arise depending on the type of f , on k(v) and of the types of the simple factors\nof (Gad , X ad ). In connection to 4.6.4 see 1.14.3.\n\u0001\n1.8. Crystalline coordinates. We consider a standard Hodge situation f, L(p) , v\nas in 1.3. Let v ad be the prime of E(Gad , X ad ) divided by v and let d be the dimension\nof X as a complex manifold. Let y : Spec(k) \u0592\u2192 NW (k) be defined by a G-ordinary point\ny0 : Spec(k) \u2192 Nk(v) and let (Ay , pAy ) := y0\u2217 (A, PA ). The principally quasi-polarized\nfiltered F -crystal (associated to the natural pull back of (A, PA )) over the completion\nk[[x1 , . . . , xd ]] of the local ring of y in Nk , can be put in a very practical form (cf. 4.7.2).\nUsing this we get:\nTheorem 8. The moduli formal scheme My of G-deformations (i.e. of deformations factoring through N ) of (Ay , pAy ) over spectra of artinian local W (k)-algebras\nhaving k as their residue field, is naturally isomorphic to the formal torus of the completion Td of Gdm (viewed over W (k)) in the special fibre of its identity element section.\nUnder such an isomorphism, the principally polarized abelian scheme over Spec(W (k))\nobtained by pull back via the G-canonical lift of y0 , corresponds to the identity element of\nTd (W (k)).\nTheorem 8 and its logical (abstract) variants in contexts without (principal) polarizations (see 4.7.11 6)) represents a generalization of the following three things:\n\u2022 the main result of [No1] (in the less general case of a standard Hodge situation);\n\u2022 [De3, 2.1.3];\n\u2022 [Ka3, 3.7.1-3 and 4.3.1-2] (see 4.7.11 8); for p = 2 cf. also with 4.14.3 E).\nSo we obtain G-multiplicative (crystalline) coordinates of My . When k(v ad ) = Fp ,\nthe situation is very close in spirit to the one in [De3, 1.4] (cf. 4.7.5-29; see also its abstract\n31\n\n\fgeneralization of 4.7.11 4) and 8)): we obtain G-canonical multiplicative (crystalline)\ncoordinates. In order to make the connection with previous works, the proofs of 4.7.5-22\nfollow the pattern of [De2, 1.4.2 and 1.4.7] (cf. 4.7.10).\nTheorem 8 is a very particular case of 4.7.11 6) and so is part of a general theory of\ncrystalline coordinates for Shimura p-divisible groups over k presented in 4.7.11. It is the\ninducing property of 3.6.18.5 \u2013and its variants of 3.6.18.7 in the relative context\u2013 which\nallows significant simplifications and advancements in such a theory: our approach in\n4.7.11 is \"cook and pick\". By this we mean: we consider a priori a p-divisible object with\ntensors of some (logical) Fontaine category MF[0,1] (W (k)[[x1 , ..., xm]]), m \u2208 N, and then\nwe pick up a connection (see 3.6.18.4 and 3.6.18.7.0) which makes it to be viewed as a\n\u2207\np-divisible object with tensors of MF[0,1]\n(W (k)[[x1 , ..., xm]]) and whose Kodaira\u2013Spencer\nmap is injective (cf. a) and b) of 4.7.11 2)); the \"cooking\" is done in such a way that\nthe \"picking\" is possible (it is enough to be able to \"perform the picking\" mod p, cf. the\nlifting property). This approach, in most cases (like the ones of the classical situation of\n[De2] and [Ka3-4] or like the ones pertaining to the case k(v ad ) = Fp ), avoids entirely\nany computation (even for p = 2, cf. 4.14.3 E).\nAs a particular case of this general theory we have (see 4.7.14.1 for arguments):\nCorollary. If Ak is an abelian variety over k of dimension d0 having a lift A (over\nW (k)) of quasi CM type (see def. 2.2.17), then the moduli formal scheme of deformations\nd2\n\nof Ak is naturally isomorphic to the formal torus Td20 obtained by completing Gm0 (viewed\nover W (k)) in its identity element section, with the abelian variety A corresponding to\nthe identity element of Td20 (W (k)).\nThis is the most general (abelian varieties) context in which we can (presently) prove\nthe existence of \"good\" (i.e. useful and natural) crystalline coordinates. For variants of\nTheorem 8 and of this Corollary, including the additive case, see 4.7.14.2 and 4.7.11 5)\nand 6); here, for instance, in the context of Theorem 8, by the additive case we mean that\nthe Frobenius lift of W (k)[[x1 , ..., xd]] is as in 4.7.1 and we try to get even more practical\nforms of 4.7.2. The main merit of the Theorem of 4.7.11 6) is: its simple form works out\nin all cyclic diagonalizable cases.\n1.8.1. Complements. For a list of the new types of equations (differential or\nnot) showing up in the theory of crystalline coordinates when we move from a classical\nordinary context to a cyclic diagonalizable one, see end of 4.7.11 1). For a digression\non crystalline coordinates in the context of an ordinary K3 surface over k (including the\ncase p = 2) see 4.7.11 2A). For a sample of the lifting process (to be fully elaborated in\n\u00a77 and [Va12]) which allows the passage (of many properties) from a Shimura (filtered)\n\u03c3-crystal context to the attached Shimura (filtered) Lie \u03c3-crystal context, see 4.7.11 2B).\nIn 4.14.2 we point out that all of 4.7.11 can be performed in the context of CL2 , without\nany reference (even if possible via a lifting process) to p-divisible groups.\n1.9. A Galois property. In 4.8 we present the following Galois property of Gordinary points of Nk(v) ; it answers a question of C. -L. Chai. We consider a standard\n32\n\n\fHodge situation (f, L(p) , v). With the notations of 1.3, we consider a G-ordinary point\nSpec(k) \u2192 Nk(v) and a lift of it z : Spec(V ) \u2192 N , with V a DVR which is a finite, flat\n\u0002 \u0003\nextension of W (k). Let K := V p1 and let AV := z \u2217 (A). We have (see 4.8.2):\n\nTheorem 9. There is a finite field extension K1 of K such that the Galois representation\n1\n\u03c1 : Gal(K\u0304/K1 ) \u2192 GL(H\u00e9t\n(AK\u0304 , Zp ))(Zp ) = GL(L\u2217(p) \u2297Z(p) Zp )(Zp )\n\nfactors through the group of Zp -valued points of an integral, solvable subgroup of GZp .\n1\nThe identification H\u00e9t\n(AK\u0304 , Zp ) = L\u2217(p) \u2297Z(p) Zp used here is not canonical, cf. [Va2,\ntop of p. 473]. The proof of Theorem 9, as R. Pink pointed out to us, is a direct\nconsequence of Theorem 4 and of 4.7.2 (and so of the proof of Theorem 8). For variants\nof this Galois property (including the case of a finite field) see 4.8.3 d) and e).\n\n1.9.1. The abstract generalized Serre\u2013Tate (ordinary) theory. a) to c) of\nTheorem 1, Theorems 2 and 4, the abstract form of Theorem 9 (see 4.8.3 e)) as well as\n3.1.1.2, 3.1.4-5, 3.9.3, 3.9.4 and 3.13.7.1.2 form the abstract generalization of the Serre\u2013\nTate's (ordinary) theory for Shimura \u03c3-crystals (or Shimura p-divisible groups) over k;\nsee 1.13 for the case p = 2. See Step 1 of Appendix for the context of CL2 .\n1.10. On the passage from the Hodge type to the preabelian type. The\nphenomena of 1.4-8 involving N are an intrinsic \"property\" of N (and of Nk(v) ), i.e. do\nnot depend on the special principally polarized abelian scheme (A, PA ) we got over N\n(only \u03c4 of 1.4 a) does depend on it); so they \"hold\" for (i.e. can be transferred to) special\nfibres of integral canonical models of Shimura varieties of preabelian type. For instance,\nwe have (cf. 4.9.8 and 4.9.8.2) the following combined version of the density property of\nShimura-ordinary strata and of the existence of refined canonical Lie stratifications and\nof Shimura-canonical lifts.\n1\n1\nTheorem 10. Let Nk(v\nof\n1 ) be the special fibre of an integral canonical model N\na Shimura variety Sh(G1 , X 1 ) of preabelian type with respect to a prime v 1 of E(G1 , X 1 )\n1\ndividing a rational prime p > 2. Then Nk(v\n1 ) has a refined canonical Lie stratification in\np\n1\nG (Af )-invariant, reduced, locally closed subschemes; it has precisely 1 open stratum (if\ndimC (X 1 ) \u2265 1 then its complement is of pure codimension 1). In the case of a standard\nHodge situation we regain the refined canonical Lie stratification mentioned in 1.6. The\npoints (with values in fields) of the open stratum are called G1 -ordinary (or Shimura1\nordinary) points of Nk(v\n1 ) ; any such point with values in k, has a uniquely determined\n(in the same \u2013parabolic type\u2013 way as in 1.5 but expressed over k\u0304) G1 -canonical (also\ncalled Shimura-canonical) lift Spec(W (k)) \u2192 N 1 .\nThe refined canonical Lie stratifications and the Shimura-canonical lifts are functorial\nwith respect to finite maps (see def. [Va2, 2.4 and 3.2.6]) between Shimura quadruples.\n\nIn 4.9 we present a proof of this for primes p \u2265 5 (for the case p = 3 see \u00a76). The\nproof relies on the following result.\n33\n\n\fThe Existence Property. We consider a Shimura quadruple (G0 , X0 , H0 , v0 ),\nwith (G0 , X0 ) defining a Shimura variety of adjoint, abelian type, with v0 a prime of\nE(G0 , X0 ) dividing a rational prime p \u2265 3 such that G0 is unramified over Qp , and\nwith H0 a hyperspecial subgroup of G0 (Qp ). Then there is a standard Hodge situation\n(f 0 , L0(p) , v 0 ), with\nf 0 : Sh(G0 , X 0 ) \u0592\u2192 Sh(GSp(W, \u03c8), S)\nan injective map such that (G0ad , X 0ad ) = (G0 , X0 ) and v 0 divides v0 , and with G0der as\nthe maximal isogeny cover of G0ad allowed by the abelian type (for p \u2265 5, cf. [Va2, 6.4.2]\nand the translation of [Va2, 5.1, 5.6.5 and 5.6.9] \u2013see 2.3.6\u2013 in the language of standard\nHodge situations; for p = 3, cf. \u00a76). Moreover, if we define a hyperspecial subgroup H 0\nof G0 (Qp ) as in 1.3, we can assume (cf. [Va2, 3.2.7.1]) that H 0ad = H0 .\nIn order to get Theorem 10 from this result, we need to use a diagonal trick (see\n4.9.2): its goal is to \"combine\" (i.e. put together) two standard Hodge situations involving\ntwo Shimura quadruples having the same adjoint, in order to show the independence on\nwhich such standard Hodge situation we use to define (or get) some properties. The\ndiagonal trick itself is supported:\na) by the density part of 1.4 b);\nb) by a variant (see 4.9.2.0 A) of 2.3.13 in a non a priori reductive context;\nc) by the direct sum decompositions of 3.11.8.1;\nd) and by Fontaine's comparison theory (used \u2013for p = 3\u2013 in a way similar to the\ndetailed one of the review \u2013with p = 2\u2013 2.3.18.1 E but in the adjoint context).\nFor the G1 (Apf )-invariant part of Theorem 10 we use the strong approximation theorem for adjoint Q\u2013groups (see 4.9.7.1 for a second possible approach).\n1.10.1. Extension of terminology. Strictly speaking 1.10 a) to d) are not needed\nto prove Theorem 10, as in connection to Newton polygons we can work just rationally.\nHowever, they are indispensable for integral purposes. In other words, using 1.10 a)\nto d) and standard arguments on right translations by Hecke operators, we define (see\n4.9.17) Shimura adjoint (resp. Shimura adjoint filtered) Lie \u03c3-crystals attached to points\n1\nof Nk(v\n1 ) with values in algebraically closed fields (resp. with values in Witt rings of such\nfields); so we define also toric points (in particular, U -ordinary and T -ordinary points)\n1\nof Nk(v\n1 ) (see 4.9.17.2 and 4.9.17.5), as well as U -canonical lifts of U -ordinary points\nwith values in perfect fields. Moreover, Theorem 10 has variants (see 4.9.9) in other\ncontexts, like the one of the Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Dieudonn\u00e9 adjoint (or the quasi-ultra,\nor the ultimate adjoint, etc.) stratifications; again, for these variants 1.10 a) to d) are\nindispensable.\n1.11. Dense Hecke orbits and functorial aspects. We do expect (cf. 4.10.1;\np\n1\n1\ncf. also [Ch2, p. 441]) that the open stratum of Nk(v\n1 ) is the smallest G (Af )-invariant,\n1\nopen subscheme of Nk(v\n1 ) . This is proved for MFp in [Ch2]. Using Theorem 10, we prove\n34\n\n\fit for Shimura curves (cf. 4.10.3). For a more substantial approach to the general case\nsee 4.10.5.\nIn 4.11 we prove the functorial behavior of G-ordinary points and of G-canonical\nlifts of them. Let f0 : (G, X, H, v) \u0592\u2192 (G1 , X1 , H1 , v1 ) be an injective map between two\nShimura quadruples of Hodge type, having integral canonical models N and respectively\nN1 . We assume v is relatively prime to 2. We have a natural morphism (still denoted\nby) f0 : N \u2192 N1 (cf. [Va2, 3.2.7 4)]). We also assume the existence of an injective map\n\u0001\nf1 : (G1 , X1 , H1 , v1 ) \u0592\u2192 GSp(W, \u03c8), S, GSp(W, \u03c8)(L(p) \u2297Z(p) Zp ), p\n\n(with L(p) a Z(p) -lattice of W for which we have a perfect form \u03c8 : L(p) \u2297Z(p) L(p) \u2192 Z(p) )\nsuch that (f1 , L(p) , v1 ) and (f1 \u25e6 f0 , L(p) , v) are standard Hodge situations. So the Zariski\nclosure of G (resp. of G1 ) in GSp(L(p) , \u03c8) is a reductive group GZ(p) (resp. G1 Z(p) ) over\nZ(p) . Let k(v) and k(v1 ) be the residue field of v and respectively of v1 . We have (cf.\n4.11.1.1 and 4.11.2):\nTheorem 11. A G-ordinary point of Nk(v) is mapped by f0 into a G1 -ordinary\npoint of N1k(v1 ) iff there is a torus T of GZp such that:\n1) there is a cocharacter \u03bc : Gm \u0592\u2192 TW (k(v)) , which over an embedding of W (k(v))\nin C, extending the composite inclusion O(v) \u2282 E(G, X) \u2282 C, is G(C)-conjugate to the\ncocharacters \u03bc\u2217x , x \u2208 X, defined as in 1.4 (see also 2.3.1);\n2) there is a parabolic subgroup P1 of G1 Zp containing T and a Borel subgroup of\nGZp and whose Lie algebra has the property that its elements take the F 1 -filtration of\nL\u2217(p) \u2297Zp W (k(v)) defined by \u03bc (as in 1.4 a)) into itself.\nMoreover, if these conditions hold, then a G-canonical lift of N is mapped by f0 into\na G1 -canonical lift of N1 .\nThe equivalent conditions of Theorem 11 imply k(v) = k(v1 ) but the converse of this\ndoes not hold (see 4.11.4-6). The proof of Theorem 11 relies on 1.4 a), 4.4.13.2 and on\nstandard arguments on reductive groups over Zp or W (k).\n1.12. Some important applications. Till 1.13 we assume k = k\u0304. In 4.12-13\nwe present two important applications inspired from the deformation principle of 3.6.14.\nFirst, in 4.12 we formulate the integral Manin problem for a standard Hodge situation as\nwell as for integral canonical models of Shimura varieties of preabelian type with respect\nto primes relatively prime to 2. For a standard Hodge situation (f, L(p) , v), with the\nnotations of 1.3, the problem is to determine all principally quasi-polarized Shimura \u03c3crystals attached to k-valued points of (a connected component of) Nk . A solution (cf.\n\u00a711; see the proof of 4.12.12 for some particular cases) to this problem is provided by\nMilne's conjecture (see d) of 4.4.1 3) and 1.15.1) and by the completion property. The\ncompletion property is stated in 3.6.15 A as an expectation and will be proved in \u00a711,\nstarting from the isogeny property to be referred in 1.15.7 and from the strong form of the\ngeneralized Manin problem (see B) of Theorem 14); see the proof of 4.12.12 and 4.12.12.0\nfor samples (in contexts in which the isogeny property can be checked immediately).\n35\n\n\fFor the initial motivations behind the completion property, see 3.6.15 B and 3.6.14.4.1.\nIn the language of 1.6.5, the completion property (over F) says: the Grothendieck's\nspecialization category of Nk has as many objects as we can think of.\nThere is a second approach to the completion property of 1.12: see 4.12.12.7.\nFor different local (resp. global) integral Manin problems see 4.12.14-19 (resp.\n4.12.21). For a new (though very close in spirit to [Ta]) and simple solution to the\noriginal Manin problem we refer to 4.12.12.4.\nSecond, in 4.13 we present (partially; to be continued in \u00a79-10, cf. 1.15.6) the\ninvariance principle. Let p \u2265 3 be a rational prime. Let (Gi , Xi , Hi , vi ), i = 1, 2, be\ntwo Shimura quadruples of preabelian type, with vi dividing p. Let Ni be the integral\ncanonical model of (Gi , Xi , Hi , vi ), i = 1, 2. Let H0i \u2282 Gi (Apf ) be a subgroup such that\nthe subgroup H0i \u00d7 Hi of Gi (Af ) is smooth for the pair (Gi , Xi ) (see def. [Va2, 2.11])\nand an extra mild condition holds (satisfied for instance, if the image of H0i in Gad\ni (Ql ),\nfor some prime l different from p, has no pro-p subgroup), i = 1, 2. Let yi : Spec(k) \u2192\nNik /H0i , i = 1, 2, be points such that the non-trivial part of the Shimura adjoint Lie\n\u03c3-crystal attached to y1 is isomorphic to the non-trivial part of the Shimura adjoint Lie\n\u03c3-crystal attached to y2 (see 2.3.10 and 3.10.1 for definitions). Let Oyi be the local ring\nof yi (in NiW (k) ) and let Oyh\u2227\nbe the p-adic completion of its henselization, i = 1, 2. The\ni\nrefined canonical Lie stratification of Nik(vi ) makes Spec(O(p)hyi ) := Spec(Oyh\u2227\n/pOyh\u2227\n) to\ni\ni\nbe a stratified scheme. One variant of the local form of the invariance principle is (see\n4.13.1; see 4.13.2 and 4.13.3 3) for other variants):\nTheorem 12. Let n \u2208 N. There is an isomorphism\nh\u2227\n\u03c1 : Spec(Oyh\u2227\n)\u2192Spec(O\n \u0303\ny2 )\n1\n\ninducing an isomorphism\nh\n\u03c1(p) : Spec(O(p)hy1 )\u2192Spec(O(p)\n \u0303\ny2 )\n\nof stratified schemes, such that the pull back through \u03c1 of the non-trivial part of the\nShimura adjoint filtered Lie F -crystal over Spec(O(p)hy2 ) defined by the natural morphism Spec(Oyh\u2227\n) \u2192 N2 , when taken mod pn , is isomorphic to the non-trivial part taken\n2\nn\nmod p , of the Shimura adjoint filtered Lie F -crystal over Spec(O(p)hy1 ) defined by the\nnatural morphism Spec(Oyh\u2227\n) \u2192 N1 (see 4.9.20 and 4.13 for the definition of these Lie\n1\nF -crystals).\nTheorem 12 is a consequence of variants modulo powers of p of Theorem 5.\nAs a direct application of what the completion property says in some particular cases\nin which Gad is of An type, for future references, we state here the combined version of\n4.12.12, 4.12.12.2 and 4.12.13 2). We have:\nTheorem 13. We assume p \u2265 2. Let (d, r \u2212 d) be a pair of non-negative integers. There is q \u2208 N, a geometrically connected, projective, smooth scheme L(r,d\u2212r) over\n36\n\n\fW (Fpq ) and a p-divisible group DL(r,d\u2212r) over L(r,d\u2212r) of rank r and dimension d such\nthat:\na) DL(r,d\u2212r) is versal in each k-valued point of L(r,d\u2212r) ;\nb) the relative dimension of L(r,d\u2212r) over W (Fpq ) is exactly d(r \u2212 d);\nc) any p-divisible group over W (k) of rank r and dimension d is obtained by pulling\nback DL(r,d\u2212r) via a W (k)-valued point of L(r,d\u2212r) .\nMoreover L(r,d\u2212r) is of general type.\nTheorem 13 represents as well a second (totally independent) proof of the ordinary\nspecialization result of 3.1.8.1. We refer to L(r,d\u2212r) as a complete Shimura envelope (or\nlibrary). The word library is a more recent terminology suggested by [LO, \u00a74] and [dJO,\n\u00a75] which speak about catalogues of p-divisible groups. Warning: the catalogues of loc.\ncit. are \"complete\" in their specialized class of p-divisible groups (i.e. from the point of\nview c)) but not from the point of view of the projectiveness of L(r,d\u2212r) .\n1.12.1. Null strata and the generalized Manin problem. For some more\napplications of Theorem 13 and its proof we refer to:\n\u2013 4.12.12.5 and 4.12.13 4) (they represent a new \u2013independent\u2013 approach to the\ndeformation theory of p-divisible groups, in the complete, local, Noetherian case having\na perfect residue field), and to\n1\n\u2013 4.12.12.6 (it says that each integral canonical model Nk(v\n1 ) mentioned in Theorem\n10 has k-valued toric points of all possible, i.e. expected, types; this is the second part\nof B) below).\n4.12.12.6 has itself many applications (see 4.12.12.6.1-3). Here we will just mention\nthree of them. First, when combined with 3.13.7.6.0 it allows us (mainly see 4.12.12.6.2\nA) to list all the main properties of the A1 Lie type case of the quasi-ultra stratifications\nmentioned in 1.10.1; this (together with its p = 2 version, see 4.14.3 J) represents the\ngeneralization of [GO]. Some properties are completely new, like the simple formula (see\nend of 4.12.12.6.6 3)) computing the number of strata of such a quasi ultra-stratification\n(in the A1 Lie type case) having U -ordinary points.\nSecond (see 4.12.12.6.3-4 for proofs), we have:\n1\nTheorem 14. A) The null stratum of the special fibre Nk(v\n1 ) of an integral canonical\nmodel as in Theorem 10 has toric points (and so it is always non-empty).\nB) (the strong \u2013Weyl\u2013 form of the generalized Manin problem) Any stratum\n1\nof the absolute stratification of Nk(v\n1 ) has a toric point and all expected toric points do\nshow up.\n1\nC) The number of strata of the absolute stratification of Nk(v\n1 ) is at most equal to\nthe number of elements of the Weyl group of G1C .\n1\nThe null stratum of Nk(v\n1 ) is the stratum of the refined canonical Lie (or absolute)\nstratification, which is \"opposite\" to the open, dense stratum and is the natural generalization of the supersingular stratum of MFp . With the notations of 1.3-5, a point\n\n37\n\n\fy : Spec(k) \u2192 Nk(v) is a point of the null stratum iff the Shimura Lie \u03c3-crystal attached\nto it has all slopes 0. Obviously, the null stratum is closed. In the classical situation\nof MFp one shows that its supersingular stratum is non-empty by taking products of\nsupersingular elliptic curves. In the general context, for the proof of A) (as well as of\n4.12.12.6) we use the following two things:\na) the proof of Theorem 10, to reduce the situation to the context of a standard\nHodge situation (so in b) to e) below we use the notations of 1.3-5);\nb) [Har, 5.5.3] and standard properties of Shimura subpairs of (G, X) (see [Va2,\n3.2.11 and 3.3.3]; see also 4.12.12.6.0 2)); based on them we show the existence of suitable\nmaximal Z(p) -tori of GZ(p) .\nSee 4.12.12.6.4.3 for abstract (general) forms of A) (and so implicitly of b)). B) is a\nconsequence of the following three things:\nc) the logical abstract form of A) in the context of Shimura \u03c3-crystals;\nd) 4.12.12.6;\ne) the (abstract) inductive property of 3.9.7.2.\nThe idea of 3.9.7.2 is: if k = k\u0304 and if (M, \u03c6, G) is a Shimura \u03c3-crystal with the\nproperty that not all slopes of (Lie(G)[ p1 ], \u03c6) are zero, then from many points of view\n(including Newton polygons), the study of (M, \u03c6, G) gets reduced to the study of a\nShimura \u03c3-crystal (M, \u03c61 , G1 ) with G1 a reductive subgroup of G different from G. This\ninductive approach (of dropping the relative dimension of G) applies to CL2 as well;\nhowever, the arguments of 3.9.7.2 do not apply (in general) to CL3 , though one could\nhope to mimic them in many situations.\nTo our knowledge, the strong \u2013Weyl\u2013 form of the generalized Manin problem was\nnot known before even for Siegel modular varieties; implicitly, the Fact of 4.12.9 1) was\nnot known previously. A weaker form of B) can be roughly formulated as: all Newton\npolygons \"showing up\" are the ones obtained using specializations of (see [Va2, 2.10])\nspecial points of N with values in fields of fractions of DVR's of mixed characteristic;\nthis was predicted implicitly by the Langlands\u2013Rapoport conjecture (see the definition of\nadmissible homomorphisms in [Mi1, \u00a74]; see also [Ch3, rm. after Theorem 1] for a down\nto earth translation).\nThird, the study of the orbit map of the group action GA of 1.6.1 a) splits up in terms\nof double cosets of suitable parabolic subgroups of Gad\nF (see Fact of Step 3 of 3.13.7.3 and\n3.13.7.6.1 for the abstract context). 4.12.12.6 allows us to list out all cases when there\nis such a double coset consisting just of 1 orbit and corresponding to a stratum of the\nquasi-ultra stratification of Nk(v) of dimension 0 (see 3.13.7.6.1-2 for the abstract context\nand see 4.12.12.6.2 B for the geometric context of special fibres of the integral canonical\nmodels of Theorem 10). We have:\nTheorem 15. In the listed cases, there is a unique stratum of the quasi-ultra stratification of Nk(v) of dimension 0. All its points are toric points, called pivotal. Even\nmore, the Shimura adjoint Lie \u03c3-crystals attached to k-valued points of it are all inner\n38\n\n\fisomorphic (it is 4.2.10 which allows us to speak about inner; restricting to a connected\ncomponent of Nk(v) , we have a form of this in terms of Shimura \u03c3-crystals attached to\nk-valued points of it).\nThe toric part of Theorem 15 is an application of the reduction steps of 3.13.7.4 B\nand 3.13.7.6.0 and of a (significantly simplified form of) the inductive proof of 3.6.15 B\n(see 3.13.7.6.3 for the abstract context). Theorem 15 represents the generalization of the\nfollowing classical result: if k = k\u0304, then any \u03c3-crystal (M, \u03c6) over k whose truncation\nmod p is isomorphic to the truncation mod p of the \u03c3-crystal (M, \u03c61 ) of a product of\nsupersingular elliptic curves over k, is in fact isomorphic to (M, \u03c61 ). In the classical\nsituation, one uses the fact that \u03c621 is p times a \u03c3 2 -linear automorphism of M . This\nelementary trick does not work in the general context and this explains why we need all\nthe \"Weyl staff\" of 3.13.7.1-6 for proving Theorem 15.\nIn the remaining (i.e. not listed) cases (involving most of Shimura varieties of An or\ntype) it can be checked using relatively simple computations the existence of strata\nof the quasi-ultra stratification of Nk(v) having dimension 0 and toric points: we refer to\n\u00a79-10 for these computations (see also Corollary 2 of 4.6.7).\n\nDnH\n\nIt is worth mentioning that 3.13.7.6.1 and 3.13.6.7.3 apply as well to the class CL2 ,\ncf. 3.13.7.7.\n1.12.2. Degrees of definition. One of the things which comes again and again\nis: degrees of definition. To detail what we mean by this we refer to 1.6.2. 3.6.15 B\nimplies: if k = F, then (M, \u03c6, G) is obtained from a Shimura \u03c3-crystal over a finite field\nby extension of scalars. So roughly speaking the degree of definition of (M, \u03c6, G) is the\nsmallest possible degree over Fp of such a finite field. As this definition is too technical\nfor practical computations, in most of the cases we allow k to be arbitrary and moreover:\n\u2013 we either restrict (see 3.11.3) to specific Shimura \u03c3-crystals for which we can define\n(using some logical lifts) immediately its degree of definition (later on we will check that\nthe two definitions coincide; for instance, this is done implicitly in 3.11.8 for the Shimuraordinary context), or\n\u2013 we work with potentially cyclic diagonalizable Shimura filtered \u03c3-crystals and we\ndefine (see 2.2.16.4 and 2.2.22 1)) their degrees of definition using their canonical split\ncocharacters (of [Wi]).\nSimilarly, in adjoint Shimura contexts we define A-degrees of definition. For samples,\nsee 2.2.16.4-5, 3.11.3, etc.\n1.13. The geometric picture of the case p = 2. For the case of a p = 2\nstandard Hodge situation introduced in 2.3.18, see 4.12.12.1 and 4.14.3. The needed well\nknown facts from crystalline cohomology pertaining to the mixed characteristic (0, 2) are\nreviewed (parts of it with new personal proofs) in 2.3.18.1. For instance, based on them\nand on 3.14, we get that all of 1.4-6 holds for a p = 2 standard Hodge situation (f, L(2) , v)\nmodulo two modifications (cf. 4.14.3).\n39\n\n\fFirst, we do not prove that the U -canonical lifts of 1.5.1 (and so implicitly the Gcanonical lifts of 1.4 c)) can be always uniquely identified, i.e. determined (we recall that\nto locally lift a 2-divisible group over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 2 it\nis not enough to lift the filtration in the crystalline cohomology context; see 2.3.18.1).\nSo presently, it is convenient to allow a finite number of U -canonical lifts of a k-valued\nU -ordinary point y of Nk(v) : a W (k)-valued point of N lifting y is a U -canonical lift\niff its attached Shimura filtered \u03c3-crystal is a U -canonical lift. Accordingly, 3.1.1.2 in\ngeometric situations has to be slightly modified for p = 2 (for instance, as in 4.14.3 B4).\nOn the other hand, 4.14.3 B3 shows that we can define uniquely a U -canonical lift of y,\nprovided the Shimura adjoint Lie \u03c3-crystal attached to y does not have slope \u22121.\nSecond, the part of 1.12.1 referring to 4.12.12.6 has to be weaken as suggested by\n4.14.3 J (however, 4.14.3.2.5 points out variants where such a weakening can be considerably eliminated).\n1.13.1. The D case of PEL type embeddings for p = 2. Warning: as in [Mi1,\n1.1], in the definition of Shimura varieties of PEL type \u2013and so of PEL type embeddings\u2013\nwe allow Q\u2013semisimple algebras which are not necessarily simple. For the case p = 2 of\na PEL type embedding involving the D case (see [Ko2, ch. 5] for the meaning of this),\nleft aside in loc. cit. and in [LR], see 2.3.18 B: it represents the first new instances of\np = 2 standard Hodge situations (while reobtaining all previous ones). 2.3.18 B finally\ncompletes the proof of the existence and uniqueness of integral canonical models in the\nintegral context of PEL type embeddings. This proof was started in the original edition\n(dated 1965) of [MFK] and continued \u2013as a direct application of loc. cit. and of Serre\u2013\nTate and Grothendieck\u2013Messing deformation theories (see [Me])\u2013 in [LR] and [Ko2]. We\nformulate 2.3.18 B here, in a slightly different (and weaker) form, more convenient to\nmake the passage from [Ko2] (without using too much of the language of this paper). Let\nf , L(2) and v (resp. F) have the same significance as in 1.3 (resp. 1.6.1) but for p = 2.\nWe assume that \u03c8 induces a perfect form L(2) \u2297Z(2) L(2) \u2192 Z(2) , that the Zariski closure\nof G in GL(L(2) ) is a reductive group GZ(2) over Z(2) and that all simple factors of Gad\nare of some Dn Lie type. Let B be a Z(2) -subalgebra of End(L(2) ) such that:\n\u2013 it is self dual with respect to \u03c8;\n\u2013 over W (F) is a product of matrix W (F)-algebras;\n\u2013 G is the connected component of the origin of the subgroup of GSp(W, \u03c8) fixing\nits elements.\nLet H, K2 , M and O(v) be defined as in 1.3. We have:\nTheorem 16. The normalization N of the Zariski closure of Sh(G, X)/H in MO(v)\nis the integral canonical model of the Shimura quadruple (G, X, H, v).\nThe new ideas needed to handle this left aside case (i.e. to prove Theorem 16),\nbesides the ones of [Ko2, ch. 5] and [Va2, \u00a75], consist in:\na) a slight refinement of parts of [Ko2] (for instance, we have in mind 7.1-2 of loc.\ncit.) in the p = 2 context of the D case (see 2.3.18 B2-3);\n40\n\n\fb) a slight refinement of [Fa2, th. 10] (see iii) to v) of 2.3.18 B9);\nc) performing a greater part of [Va2, 5.2-3] in the context of the W (F)-algebra Re\ninstead of the W (F)-algebra R\u0303e of loc. cit.\nSee below for why N is uniquely determined as an integral canonical model.\n1.13.2. Uniqueness of integral canonical models in mixed characteristic\n(0, 2). 2.2.1.4 fulfills [Va2, 3.2.1.4 5)]. The new thing it brings: any regular, formally\nsmooth scheme over a DVR of mixed characteristic (0, 2) and index of ramification 1\nis healthy in the sense of [Va2, 3.2.1 2)]. 2.2.1.4 implies (see 2.2.1.5) the uniqueness of\n(local) integral canonical models of Shimura varieties in mixed characteristic (0, 2). This\nlast result was not known previously, even for the Siegel modular variety of dimension\n3 or 6 (i.e. of genus 2 or 3). What 2.2.1.4 brings new to Step B of [Va2, 3.2.17]: we\nalternate using an \"analysis\" mod p (with p \u2265 2) with the approach of loc. cit. pertaining\nto mixed characteristic; so we can appeal to the language of 2.2.1.0 and so to the results\nof [Fa1, p. 31-3].\nSee 2.2.1.5.2 for a second approach to the uniqueness of projective (local) integral\ncanonical models of Shimura varieties of compact type in arbitrary mixed characteristic.\n1.13.3. The passage from the Hodge type to the abelian type in mixed\ncharacteristic (0, 2). 4.14.3.2 achieves the passage of the existence of integral canonical\nmodels in mixed characteristic (0, 2) from the Hodge type to the abelian type. [Va2, 6.2.2\na)] has a very restricted application in mixed characteristic (0, 2). So in order to achieve\nthe mentioned passage, i.e. to get a p = 2 version of [Va2, 6.2.2 b)], as we have 2.2.1.5,\nwe just need to get p = 2 variants of the corrected versions (see AE.4 and AE.4.1-2)\nof [Va2, 6.2.2.1]. They are developed along different parts of this paper (for instance,\nsee 4.14.3.2.1-2) and involve mild conditions. For instance, the main assumption we\nneed in order to achieve the mentioned passage refers to the fact that we start from a\np = 2 standard Hodge situation (f, L(2) , v) whose associated integral canonical model N\nis such that each connected component of Nk(v) has k-valued quasi-pivotal points (i.e.\ntoric points whose attached Shimura adjoint Lie \u03c3-crystals do not have slope \u22121). The\np = 2 version of 4.12.12.6 implies that this holds, provided the connected components\nof Nk(v) are permuted transitively by G(A2f ) (for instance, if the Shimura pair (G, X)\ninvolving f is of compact type, cf. 2.3.3.1 and its p = 2 version). This assumption is\nrelated to the fact (it is just a natural extension of the part of 2.3.18.1 C referring to\nno slope 0 or no slope 1) that for k-valued quasi-pivotal points, the lifts of it to W (k)valued points of N are in one-to-one correspondence to (logical) lifts of filtrations in the\ncrystalline cohomology context, cf. 4.14.3 B3.\nWarning: we still do not know how to show that [Va2, 6.8.2] applies as in [Va2,\n6.8.3] for p = 2, i.e. we still do not know how to achieve in mixed characteristic (0, 2) the\npassage from the abelian type to the preabelian type.\nSee 2.4.1-2 for abstract variants of 2.3.17 for p = 2; the approach to them is based\non [Fa2, th. 10] and the remarks after.\n41\n\n\f1.13.3.1. Generalized Serre lemma. 4.14.3.2.1-2 lead to a form of the generalized\nSerre lemma of [Va2, 6.4.6 6)] (see also AE.4.2) in mixed characteristic (0, 2), see 4.14.4.1.\nUsing this we regain the classical Serre lemma of [Mu, p. 207]: see 4.14.4.2. To our\nknowledge, this is the first proof of loc. cit. in a p-adic (and not l-adic) context.\n1.13.4. Some samples of results with p = 2. It is worth mentioning, as samples,\nsome of the things we get in connection to Theorem 16. For instance, we have (all these\ncan be read out from different parts of 4.14.3 \u2013see 4.14.3.3\u2013, cf. also the above part of\n1.13):\na) The special fibre Nk(v) of N has a Zariski dense set of Shimura-ordinary points.\nFor all such points with values in a perfect field k of characteristic 2 we identify a finite\nset of Shimura-canonical lifts via: their attached Shimura adjoint filtered Lie \u03c3-crystals\nare of parabolic type. The W (F)-valued Shimura-canonical lifts give (by pulling back A)\nto abelian varieties over W (F) having complex multiplication.\nb) If (G, X) is of compact type, then any Shimura quadruple of abelian type having\nthe same adjoint as (G, X, H, v), has a uniquely determined integral canonical model.\nc) The quasi-ultra stratification of Nk(v) has regular, quasi-affine strata whose codimensions can be easily computed. Its number of strata is at least as expected (i.e.\npredicted in terms of a quotient set of the Weyl group of GC ).\nad\nd) If Gad\nZ2 is absolutely simple of Dn Lie type and if either n is even and GZ2 is split\nor n is odd and Gad\nZ2 is non-split, then Nk(v) has pivotal points to which the p = 2 version\nof Theorem 15 applies.\ne) If k = k\u0304 and the residue field of the prime of E(Gad , X ad ) divided by v is F2 , then\nthe completion of N in any k-valued Shimura-ordinary point y has a canonical structure\nof a formal torus, with the Shimura-canonical lifts of y corresponding to its 2-torsion\npoints.\n1.14. Afterthoughts, the Second Main Corollary and advices. Here we\ninclude the Second Main Corollary and different specifications meant to ease the reading.\n1.14.1. List of invariants. 4.14.6 contains the complete list of invariants of a given\n(p = 2) standard Hodge situation, introduced along different parts of \u00a72-4; the main class\ninvariants (in the sense of 2.2.22 2)) are listed in 4.14.6.1, while 4.14.6.2 contains references\nto the types of points (with values in fields) defined in different parts of \u00a74.\n1.14.2. More on the overall organization. Following \u00a74, there is an addenda and\nerrata to [Va2]. We refer to it as AE. The reading of AE.4 is indispensable to different\nparts of 2.3.3-11 and 4.4-14. To AE.0-3 and AE.5-6, the reader ought to look only if\nneeded. Some afterthoughts are presented in 4.14 and in Appendix. Appendix makes the\nconnection and comparison with [RR] and so in particular contains some general forms\nof the results of \u00a72-4 (see also the last paragraph of 1.2.9).\nTwo proofs of Theorem 1 are presented. The first one, less than 24 pages, starts in\n3.1 and ends in 3.4.14, via 3.5; it completely avoids the use of 3.6. The second one is just\na more elaborated form of the first one, in the sense that it leads to a much stronger form\n42\n\n\fof d) of Theorem 1 (cf. Theorem 2 of 3.15.1). It starts in 3.1 and ends in 3.7.4; it uses\nfrom 3.6 just the part till 3.6.8 inclusive. Also for 4.1-8 and 4.11 which form a sequence\ncontinuing 2.3, we need from 3.6 just 3.6.6: 3.6.6 is independent of the other parts of 3.6\nexcept of the first sentence of 3.6.0.\nThe parts 3.6.13-14 are needed just in 3.6.19, in 4.3.6 (as an exemplification) and in\n4.12-14 (for p = 2 we need to add 3.14 E and 4.14.3 K). They are independent of what\nfollows after them in 3.9 and 3.11-12; so we do not hesitate to use for their proofs results\nstated in 3.9 and 3.11-12 and so, their reading should proceed only after the reading of 3.9\nand 3.11-12. We felt that it is appropriate to include them as part of 3.6, for having the\ndeformation theory part (i.e. one of the most beautiful parts) of \u00a71-4 presented fluently.\n3.6.15-16 (resp. 3.6.17) are first used in 3.15.7-10 (resp. in 3.11.1).\nThe sequence 3.6.17-20 is very little related to what follows after it; so it can be read\nat any (needed) time after 3.6.1-14. To make \u00a74 as little dependent as possible on \u00a73 and\nto avoid repetitions, in few places of \u00a72-3 we refer to \u00a74: as a typical situation is the proof\nof 2.2.16; these references are made either as possible variants or in such a way that the\nreader will have no difficulty at all in looking in advance at one or two paragraphs of \u00a74\nfor some independent arguments.\nFor the present work we were motivated by very concrete problems, emerging from\nthe theory of Shimura varieties. Whenever we were aware from the very beginning that\nthings work out in a more general context, we worked in such a general context; when\nnot or when pedagogical reasons required, we stated (or presented) the things in the\nmore general context as remarks following the \"simpler\" context. We tried to present\nthe ideas in the most natural order. But we did not hesitate (in order to bring deeper\nunderstanding) to point out different connections between them, which somehow were\ngoing against this order.\n1.14.3. Starred results. There are two facts stated (and referred) here whose\nproofs are postponed to future papers: 4.2.8.1 and d) of 4.4.1 3); they are labeled with a\n\u2217. Whenever we use them we present a second proof entirely independent of them. The\nonly two exceptions are:\n\u2013 the starred Claim of the proof of 4.11.2, as its use is entirely avoidable, and\n\u2013 the starred answer of 4.12.5, as it is easy to restate it in a way which does not rely\non d) of 4.4.1 3) (see the paragraph following it); also we would like to point out that for\nmost purposes (like ones involving Newton polygons), the Zp -structures of 2.2.9 8) are\n\"equally good\" (though not as precise) as d) of 4.4.1 3).\nOccasionally we mention other results to be proved in \u00a75-14: they are never used\nhere and so they are not starred. So \u00a71-4 are self contained modulo the existence of\nintegral canonical models of Shimura quadruples (G, X, H, v) of preabelian type with v\ndividing p = 3; warning: the limitations of [Va2, 6.8.6] are removed in 4.6.4.\nIn other words, in 4.6.4 we prove that the criterion [Va2, 6.8.2 b)] holds (with p \u2265 3);\nthe proof relies on the simple fact that, in the context of a standard PEL situation, the\nabelian varieties obtained by natural pull backs via G-canonical lifts of G-ordinary points\n43\n\n\fwith values in F, are having complex multiplication (cf. 4.4.5; see also 1.15.8). As a\nconclusion we get (cf. 4.6.4 B):\nSecond Main Corollary. Everywhere in [Va2] the single stars (i.e. all stars except\nthe two ones of [Va2, 5.6.5 h)]) can be removed.\nSo the reader, if desires, can everywhere we are dealing with:\n\u2013 a standard Hodge situation (f, L(p) , v) such that v divides 3 and not all simple\nfactors of Gad are of some An Lie type (cf. 2.3.5.1), can add the assumption that N a\npriori exists;\n\u2013 a Shimura quadruple (G, X, H, v) such that v divides 3 and not all simple factors of\nG are of some An Lie type, can add the assumption that there is a standard Hodge situation (f 1 , L1(p) , v 1 ) such that (G1ad , X 1ad , H 1ad , v 1ad ) = (Gad , X ad , H ad , v ad ) and G1der\nis maximal among isogeny covers of Gad allowed by the abelian type (i.e. can add that\nthe analogue of [Va2, 6.4.2] holds; cf. also the Existence Property of 1.10).\nad\n\n1.14.4. Promises. 2.2.1.4, the Second Main Corollary and 4.9.8.2 are among the\nfirst places meant to fulfill (in due time) all promises and expectations of [Va2].\n1.14.5. Some extra tips. Due to the fact that the results of \u00a71-4 have been largely\ndetailed above, most common we do no stop at the beginning of the other chapters \u00a72-4\n(or of their sections), to outline their contents. However, wherever the title of a section\ndoes not make its main goal entirely obvious, this main goal is stated explicitly in the\nopening paragraph.\nAt the first lecture, the reader can skip the case p = 2, 3.6.8.3 and Step 2 of the\nsecond way (solution) of 4.6.4 A. Moreover, the reader will benefit by having a general\nlook on 3.6.8 from the very beginning; to avoid repetitions, in some more general contexts\nwe still refer to it (even if it uses very concrete situations) (cf. also 3.6.8.4 1) to 3)). \u00a71-4\nis organized as a foundation: inevitably, in some places (very few in number), it contains\nmaterial which seems isolated from the rest of it but which is used quite a lot in \u00a75-14.\nFor instance, many of the concepts of 2.2.4, 2.2.22 2), 3.13.1-6 and 3.13.8-9 are just very\npartially exploited (or referred) here. As a very wide variety of terminology is introduced\nand used, often, for convenience, we point backwards to (i.e. we remind) some definitions.\nFor us, techniques used for proving some results are equally important as these\nresults. So thus, many results in this paper are getting two or more proofs. Moreover, we\ndo not hesitate to include results which are particular cases of our future work, as long as\ntheir proofs are involving interesting techniques or are much simpler; as a sample: 2.3.18\nB is a very particular case of the p = 2 theory of Shimura varieties of abelian type to be\nfully developed in \u00a76, [Va5] and [Va3]. We strongly encourage the reader to peruse all\ntechniques introduced in this paper. Motivation: we consistently strove to capture the\nvery essence of the mathematical problems we dealt with here.\nWarning: many (relatively well known) results pertaining to reductive groups are\nmentioned with proofs or appropriate references at different parts of \u00a71-4; we felt this\n44\n\n\foffers pedagogical advantages (in comparison with a gathering of them \u2013in tens of pages\u2013\nin one section) even if few and small repetitions are made.\nWarning: based on the Second Main Corollary, in 4.9-14 we refer to results of [Va2]\nhaving a single star, without mentioning each time that all such stars have been removed\nby 4.6.4 B.\nBesides the results mentioned in 1.2-15, this paper contains many other ideas, exercises and examples. The ideas we did not have time to deal with, are presented in the\nform of problems and questions or as remarks. 63 (4.5.6 itself counts as 10) instructive\nand simple exercises, almost all with full hints or solutions, are included in \u00a72-4 and\nAE.4.2.\n1.15. On the contents of \u00a75-14. We present now in a very brief manner the\ncontents of the other two parts continuing this paper. We recall that without stating the\nthings otherwise we assume p \u2265 3.\n1.15.1. On \u00a75. In \u00a75 we elaborate on the notion of Shimura p-divisible group\nintroduced in 2.2.20 and prove the conjecture of Milne stated in [Va2, 5.6.6], in the wider\ncontext of Shimura p-divisible groups; so we also prove d) of 4.4.1 3) and remove the two\nstars of [Va1, 5.6.5 h)].\nAs a corollary of Milne's conjecture we get the integrality theorem of Shimura pdivisible groups and so also the integrality theorem of Shimura varieties of Hodge type.\nHere we formulate it only for a W (k)-valued point of an integral canonical model of a\nShimura variety of Hodge type (using 2.3.13.1 it can be stated for many other valued\npoints; see also 4.4.12).\nIf (f, L(p) , v) is a standard Hodge situation then, with the notation of 1.3, the pcomponent of the \u00e9tale\u0001component of w\u03b1\u0001 is integral (i.e. it is an element of the tensor\n1\n1\nAK0 , Zp )\u2217 , where K0 is the algebraic closure of B(k))\nAK0 , Zp \u2295 (H\u00e9t\nalgebra of H\u00e9t\niff t\u03b1 is integral (i.e. it is an element of the tensor algebra of M \u2295 M \u2217 ). What is worth\nremarking: there is no restriction on the degree of w\u03b1 , \u03b1 \u2208 J , and it also holds for p = 3.\nWe use Milne's conjecture to show how, to a standard Hodge situation (f, L(p) , v)\nand to a representation \u03c1 : GZp \u2192 GL(N ) (with N a finitely generated Zp -module,\nnot necessarily free) it is naturally associated and object (if N as a set is finite) or\na non-trivial almost p-divisible object (otherwise) C\u03c1 of MF \u2207(big\u2212p+tens) (N ) (with\nMF \u2207(big\u2212p+tens) (N ) as in 2.2.4.1 5); so the necessary precautions are taken in cases\nwe do not get something to which the gluing arguments of [Fa1, proof of 2.3] apply).\nFor almost p-divisible objects we refer to 2.2.1.7 1). If N is a free Zp -module of finite\nrank, then C\u03c1 is a filtered F -crystal in locally free sheaves on Nk(v) (cf. the conjecturally\nexpected result mentioned in [Ch2, end of (Q1)D ]). The association \u03c1 \u2192 C\u03c1 is functorial and respects the usual operations (tensor products, identity elements, duals when\ndefined, etc.). It is uniquely determined by requesting two other natural properties to be\nsatisfied.\nIn the last part of \u00a75 we introduce the notion of automorphic vector bundle on an\nintegral canonical model of a Shimura variety. We use the existence of C\u03c1 's to prove\n45\n\n\fthe existence and uniqueness of automorphic vector bundles on N (associated to representations of GZ(p) on Z(p) -free modules of finite rank or to representations of GO(v) on\nO(v) -free modules of finite rank) or on N \u00d7O(v) O(v1 ) (with O(v1 ) a local ring which is\nan \u00e9tale O(v) -algebra) (associated to representations of GO(v1 ) on O(v1 ) -free modules of\nfinite rank). We also extend these results to Shimura varieties of preabelian type, under\nslight conditions (as in [Mi4, ch. III]) on the representations involved.\n1.15.2. \u0001On \u00a76. In \u00a76 we prove that for any injective map f : (G, X) \u0592\u2192\nGSp(W, \u03c8), S , every Z(p) -lattice L(p) (of W ) good with respect to f , is automatically\ncrystalline well positioned for the map f (with respect to any prime of E(G, X) dividing p). We also prove the existence of integral canonical models of Shimura varieties of\npreabelian type with respect to primes dividing 3 and the existence of integral canonical models of Shimura varieties of Hodge type with respect to primes dividing p \u2265 3\nand (plenty of) non-hyperspecial subgroups. Related to proofs we just mention: Milne's\nconjecture of 1.15.1 is the main new ingredient besides [Va2] needed to overcome the\nlimitations of [Va2, 5.1] for p = 3.\n1.15.3. On \u00a77. In \u00a77 we introduce a method by which, from particular Shimura\n\u03c3-crystals, we construct integral, normal, faithfully flat schemes over local rings which\nare DVR's formally \u00e9tale over Z(p) , with p \u2265 2, which either have fibres having a dense\nset of formally smooth points or have the extension property (of [Va2, 3.2.3 3)]). By this\nmethod we recover all connected components of integral canonical models of Shimura\nvarieties of Hodge type. We (conjecturally) expect to get some other interesting integral\nmodels, even smooth ones; this expectation is a heuristic extrapolation of the existence of\ngeneralized Shimura p-divisible objects (M, \u03c6, G) over k for which the pair (Lie(Gad ), \u03c6)\nhas factors of one of the special E6 , E7 or Dnmixed types (see 3.10.5-6 for the definition of\nthese types). We call these normal schemes twisted connected Shimura schemes. These\nschemes and their variants (obtained using generalized Shimura p-divisible objects) are\nsupposed to lead to the construction of integral canonical models of Shimura varieties of\nspecial type. Also, they either lead to very beautiful mathematics or provide a negative\nanswer (which we do not expect) to Oort's conjecture [Oo1, p. 6].\n\u00a77 contains as well many other complements on Shimura (Lie) \u03c3-crystals (like the\nslice principle, the rigidity property, etc.). See also 2.2.6 4).\n1.15.4. On \u00a78. In \u00a78 (as a continuation of [Va10]), we apply some of the ideas\nof \u00a73, \u00a75 and \u00a77 to prove the Mumford\u2013Tate conjecture for many abelian varieties over\nnumber fields. We also present a simple strategy meant to prove the following general\ncriterion (it is known that it implies this conjecture):\nExpectation (the split criterion). Let A be an abelian variety over a number\nfield E. There is N (A) \u2208 N (very easily expressible in terms of A) such that, if l is\na prime greater or equal to N (A) and the reductive group GQl over Ql , defined as the\nconnected component of the origin of the algebraic envelope of the Galois representation\n1\n\u03c1 : Gal(\u0112/E) \u2192 GL(H\u00e9t\n(A\u0112 , Ql ))(Ql ), is a split reductive group, then the Mumford\u2013\nTate conjecture is true for A with respect to l, i.e. we have GQl = HAQl . Here HA is the\nMumford\u2013Tate group of A.\n46\n\n\f1.15.5. On \u00a79. In \u00a79 we deal in great detail with the null stratum of the special\nfibre of an integral canonical model of a Shimura variety of preabelian type: influenced\nby properties (see [LO, 0.2]) of supersingular strata of special fibres of integral canonical\nmodels of Siegel modular varieties, we formulate our expectations about the properties\nenjoyed by these null strata and prove some of these expectations. In particular, we get a\nnon-supersingular criterion similar to the non-ordinary one of 1.7. Warning: referring to\n1.6, the null stratum of Nk(v) is not always the pull back of the supersingular stratum of\nMk(v) via the morphism N \u2192 M (see 1.3), as the toric part (Gab , X ab ) of (G, X) plays\na role in the definition of this morphism.\n1.15.6. On \u00a710. The first goal of \u00a710 is to show that the number N (G, X, v) of\nstrata of the refined canonical Lie stratification of the special fibre of an integral canonical\nmodel (of a Shimura variety Sh(G, X) of preabelian type with respect to a prime v of\nE(G, X) dividing p > 2) and the dimensions of the geometrically connected components\nof these strata are easily and effectively (algorithmically) computable. To achieve this\nfirst goal, the first philosophy is:\nPh. The number N (G, X, v), the mentioned dimensions, as well as the local geometry\nof strata (like the type of singularities in the \u00e9tale topology of a given stratum, like which\nad\nstratum specializes to which stratum, etc.) depend only on the pair (Gadnc\nQp , \u03bcg ), where\nGadnc\nis the smallest direct product factor of Gad\nQp\nQp with the property that the generic fibre\nad\nad\nad\n\u03bcg of the cocharacter \u03bc : Gm \u2192 GW (k(v ad )) (with k(v ad ) as the residue field of the prime\nto B(k(v ad )).\nv ad of E(Gad , X ad ) divided by v) factors through the extension of Gadnc\nQp\nad\nHere \u03bcad is a cocharacter such that \u03bcad\ng becomes (under an embedding of B(k(v )) in\nC extending the inclusion E(Gad , X ad ) \u2282 C) Gad (C)-conjugate to the cocharacters \u03bcx ,\nx \u2208 X ad , of [Va2, 2.2].\nThis forms the global form of the invariance principle. The second philosophy, meant\nto express very concretely what we mean by \"easily and effectively\", is \"captured\" by\n3.6.14.4, by the formulas of 4.5.15.2 and 4.5.15.2.1 computing the dimensions of the strata\nof the quasi-ultra stratifications, by the CM level one (expected to hold) property (of\n1.6.2) and by the completion property (or by its weaker \u2013intermediary\u2013 form 4.12.12.6).\nWe have versions of this Ph for the other stratifications of 1.10.1 as well as for the\n(presently abstract) context of CL2 .\nThe second goal of \u00a710 is to continue the study of the ultimate types of stratifications\nand to get progress with respect to the Real Problem of 1.6.5. Implicitly we include an\nextensive study of Grothendieck's (adjoint) specialization categories and of the invariants\nintroduced in 4.12.12.8. In particular, starting from the methods of \u00a71-4, we generalize\n[dJO, \u00a75] from four points of view:\n1) we include global forms of different isogeny properties (like of [dJO, 2.17]);\n2) we work in a reductive context with cycles (warning: [dJO, \u00a75] can not be adapted\nto such a context);\n47\n\n\f3) we do not restrict to the isocline context (i.e. to the context of Shimura p-divisible\ngroups having only one slope);\n4) we go beyond [dJO, 5.13] by being, in many situations, very specific on which\np-divisible groups specializes to which p-divisible group (i.e. we introduce and solve in\nmany situations Grothendieck's integral problem).\nThese generalizations are possible due to the fact that 3.6.15 B has logical global\nvariants; for the constant Newton polygon context they are essentially obvious (cf. also\n3.15.10.1 3)) and this takes care of 1) and 2) for this context. The main tools for 3) and\n4) are: Theorems 3 and 6 and 3.15.7-9 (specifically, see 3.15.7 BP2). See [Va6] for extra\ngeneralizations of [dJO, \u00a75] in the context of CL2 .\n1.15.7. On \u00a711. The main purpose of \u00a711 is to prove the isogeny property mentioned in [Va2, 1.7]. The idea is: we follow entirely the pattern of [FC, 4.3, p. 264] but\nin the crystalline context provided by Fontaine categories; this approach is supported by\nthe fact that the isogeny property is trivial for G-ordinary points. The hard part is when\nwe deal with points of the null strata; for such points we need to combine loc. cit. with\nideas of [Mi1].\n1.15.8. On \u00a712. In \u00a712 (and \u00a76) we prove the following result. Let (G, X, H, v)\nbe a Shimura quadruple, with (G, X) a Shimura pair of adjoint, abelian type and with\n(v, 2) = 1. Then there is an injective map f : (G0 , X0 , H0 , v0 ) \u0592\u2192 (G1 , X1 , H1 , v1 ) such\nthat:\nad\n1) (Gad\n0 , X0 ) = (G, X) and (under the natural inclusion E(G, X) \u2282 E(G0 , X0 )) v0\ndivides v;\n\n2) (G1 , X1 , H1 , v1 ) is the quadruple of a Shimura variety of PEL type, with all simple\nfactors of Gad of some Al Lie type (l \u2208 N depends on the factor);\n3) provided (G, X) has no simple factor of DnH type (n \u2208 N, n > 3), the residue field\nk(v0 ) of v0 is the same as the residue field k(v1 ) of v1 ;\n4) there is an injective map f1 : (G1 , X1 ) \u0592\u2192 (GSp(W, \u03c8), S) and a Z(p) -lattice\nL(p) of W (with p the rational prime divided by v), with the property that the triples\n(f1 , L(p) , v1 ) and (f1 \u25e6 f, L(p) , v0 ) are standard Hodge situations;\n5) if (G, X) has no simple factor of DnH type (n \u2208 N, n > 3) (so we have k(v0 ) =\nk(v1 )) or if some other (simple to check) conditions hold, then we are in a context in\nwhich Theorem 11 applies.\nAs a consequence of this and its proof we prove the result concerning special points\nmentioned in [Va2, 1.6.1] as well as the following result.\n1.15.8.1. A result. Let A be an abelian scheme over the ring W (k) of Witt vectors\nof a finite field k of characteristic p \u2265 3. Let (s\u03b2 )\u03b2\u2208I be a family of Hodge cycles of A,\nincluding a polarization of degree relatively prime to p. We assume the Zariski closure\nof the subgroup Gp of GL(Lp [ p1 ]) fixing the p-components of the \u00e9tale components of the\n1\nHodge cycles of the family (s\u03b2 )\u03b2\u2208I in GL(Lp ), with Lp := H\u00e9t\n(AB(k) , Zp ), is a reductive\n48\n\n\fgroup over Zp . Let \u03c0 be the Frobenius endomorphism of Ak . Then a positive, integral\n1\npower of \u03c0, as an automorphism of Hcrys\n(Ak /W (k))[ p1 ], fixes the de Rham component of\ns\u03b2 , \u2200\u03b2 \u2208 I.\n1.15.9. On \u00a713-14. In \u00a713-14, we prove the results (pertaining to Langlands\u2013\nRapoport conjecture) stated in [Va2, 1.7].\n1.16. Some history. A small part of the results presented in \u00a71-4 (essentially\nTheorems 1 and 2 in the context of a standard Hodge situation and their applications,\npresented in a) and b) of 1.4), is a revised and improved version of the second part of our\nthesis [Va1] (see also [Va2, 1.6]). Strictly speaking b) of Theorem 1 was not stated in [Va1];\nhowever all ingredients needed for getting it can be found in loc. cit. In particular, the\nstarting idea for getting a) and c) of Theorem 1, of using Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Hasse\u2013Witt\nshifts (see 3.4.5), which is the essence of all types of computations (for instance, like the\nones involving some types of Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Hasse\u2013Witt maps), was first introduced\nin [Va1, 5.5.4] based on a suggestion of G. Faltings (and this explains our terminology).\nTo our knowledge, Shimura-ordinary types were first defined in [Va1, 5.1.3] and the use\nof Weyl elements in connection to the truncation mod p of Shimura (Lie) \u03c3-crystals was\ninitiated in [Va1, 5.6.2-3]. Implicitly, cyclic factors over (truncation mod p) of Lie \u03c3crystals (see 3.10 for elaborated definitions) were first used in [Va1, \u00a75]; see also [Va2, p.\n495] and the part of AE.4 referring to it.\n[Va13] was the initial draft (version) of this paper. Proposition 2.3.15, which is very\nuseful for different local computations, was already part of [Va13] (being just the logical\nglobalization of part of [Va2, 5.4]).\nWe came across quasi Artin\u2013Schreier systems of equations (resp. integral Manin\nproblems) on Oct. 1997 (resp. Feb. 1996): they were part of the version of this paper\nreleased on Dec. 1997.\n1.16.1. Supplementary references. Many results of \u00a71-4 are completely new; so,\nthere is relatively very few literature to be mentioned in connection to most of them. The\nliterature which influenced us and is directly related to the present work, is mentioned\n(directly or indirectly) at different moments along the manuscript. The most we can add\nto what was mentioned in 1.0-15 is as follows:\na) we do not know if weaker forms of Theorem 3 for ordinary elliptic curves are\ntraceable in the literature;\nb) Theorems 2 and 5 and the First and Second Main Corollaries are untraceable in\nthe literature;\nc) tiny bits of 1.9.1 and of 1.4 were known before (for instance, see references in\n3.1.8.1 and 4.6.1 3));\nd) in connection to Theorem 7 we refer to 4.6.2.5;\ne) if k(v) = Fp , then Theorem 9 is a consequence of Serre\u2013Tate and Dwork theories\nof coordinates mentioned in 1.0;\n49\n\n\ff ) except some very particular cases (basically pertaining to curves), there is no\nliterature in connection to Theorem 10;\ng) outside of the case k(v1 ) = k(v2 ) = Fp (which is trivial), there is no literature in\nconnection to Theorem 11;\nh) in connection to Theorem 12 we refer to 4.13.3 1);\ni) Theorem 14 was not known before outside of the case of Siegel modular varieties\nand of trivial cases (like of Shimura curves).\nAlso we do not hesitate to make connections to the literature which did not influence\nus, even if this literature appeared later than the first versions of this paper.\n1.16.2. Acknowledgements. We would like to thank Prof. Gerd Faltings for\nhis encouragement to approach the topics of 1.2, 1.4 and 1.7, for his deep insights and\nfor his suggestion mentioned in 1.2 and in 1.16. Here, as well as in [Va2], we are very\nmuch obliged to [Fa1, ch. II and VII] and [Fa2, \u00a77]. Though most of the results from\nthe mentioned two loc. cit. are restated in different parts of this paper (see 2.2.1.1 2),\n2.2.21, etc.), we still often (as a homage) refer directly to them. Directly (for instance,\nsee [Fo], [FL], [FI] and [CF]) or indirectly (via [Fa1-3] and [Wi]) we are very much obliged\nto the work of Prof. Jean-Marc Fontaine. We would like to thank Prof. Richard Pink for\npointing out the thing mentioned in 1.9, and Prof. Arthur Ogus for some comments and\nquestions, for the suggestion of 3.6.1.4 2) and for explaining us things in connection to\nthe case p = 2 for ordinary elliptic curves (these things motivated us to include 2.3.18.1).\nWe benefitted from two seminar talks of Prof. Minhyong Kim on [HK] and [Shi1-2]: for\nthem and for some answers we thank him (2.2.4 I to K had them as the very starting\npoint). Parts of AE.6 are based on discussions with Prof. James Stuart Milne: we thank\nhim for them. We would like to thank Ms. Rahel Boller for the typing of [Va13]. We\nwould like to thank FIM, ETH Z\u00fcrich, UC at Berkeley, Univ. of Utah and Univ. of\nArizona for providing us with very good conditions for the writing of this manuscript.\nThis work was partially supported by the NSF grant DMS 97-05376.\n\n50\n\n\f\u00a72 Preliminaries\n\n2.1. Notations, conventions and some definitions. Reductive groups over\nfields are always assumed to be connected. So the fibres of a reductive group over a\nscheme are connected. For a reductive group G over a scheme X we denote by Gder ,\nZ(G), Gab and Gad , respectively, the derived group of G, the center of G, the maximal\nabelian quotient of G and the adjoint group of G (see [SGA3, Vol. III, p. 257] for derived\ngroups and abelianizations). The group scheme over X parameterizing automorphisms\nof G is denoted by Aut(G) (see [SGA3, Vol. III, p. 328]). G is called quasi-split, if it has\na Borel subgroup.\nWe consider now an arbitrary affine group scheme G over X. The identity element of\nthe group G(X) is often referred as the origin; if X is connected, the connected component\nof G containing the origin is referred as the connected component of the origin. We denote\nby Lie(G) the Lie algebra of G. For an approach to it via representable contravariant\nfunctors from the category of X-schemes into the category of Lie algebras over different\nrings of global sections, see [SGA3, Vol. I, Exp. II]. If G is smooth or if X is integral and\nthe tangent space of the origin of any geometric fibre of G has the same dimension, then\nwe always identify Lie(G) with a quasi-coherent locally free sheaf Lie(G) on X endowed\nwith a Lie structure; if moreover X = Spec(R) is affine, we identify Lie(G) with a Lie\nalgebra over R whose underlying R-module is locally free of locally finite rank. Often we\ndenote Lie(G) by g. For any cocharacter \u03bc : Gm \u2192 G and for any affine X-scheme X 1\nwe denote by [\u03bcX 1 ] the G(X 1 )-conjugacy class of cocharacters defined by the extension\n\u03bcX 1 of \u03bc to X 1 ; if X 1 = Spec(R1 ) is affine, we denote [\u03bcX 1 ] also by [\u03bcR1 ].\nLet p be a rational prime. We say that a reductive group G over Q is unramified\nover Qp if GQp is unramified over Qp , i.e. if GQp is quasi-split and splits over the maximal\nunramified algebraic field extension Qun\np of Qp . The set of rational primes l such that G\nis unramified over Ql is denoted by U(G) (cf. [Va2, 6.7]). If G is a reductive group over\nS, where S is either a DVR of mixed characteristic (0, p) or the field of fractions of such\na DVR, we denote by t(G) \u2208 N the biggest non-negative, integral power of p dividing the\norder of an element of G(S) of finite order. If G is a reductive group over Q, its small\ntorsion number t\u0303(G) \u2208 N is defined by\nt\u0303(G) :=\n\nY\n\np\u2208U (G)\n\nt(GZp )\n\nY\n\nt(GQp ),\n\np\u2208U\n/ (G), p a prime\n\nwhere, for p \u2208 U(G), GZp is a reductive group ([Ti2] implies that it does not matter which\none) over Zp having GQp as its generic fibre (the existence of such numbers t(\u2217) can be\neasily deduced from the part of AE.4 referring to n \u2208 N and the Hints of the Exercise\n51\n\n\fof AE.4.2). Here and in what follows we refer to the chapter \"Addenda and Errata to\n[Va2]\" as AE. We use freely the Definitions 1 and 2 of AE.4.\nIf X is a set endowed with an equivalence relation R \u2282 X \u00d7 X, then for any element\nx \u2208 X, we denote by [x] \u2208 X/R the equivalence class of x. Let n, m \u2208 N. An n + m-tuple\nwhose entries contain (in the proper order) the entries of an n-tuple tn , is referred as an\nextension of tn . We always look at an m-tuple (n1 , ..., nm ) whose entries are (denoted\nby a lower right index to the same small letter and are) in Z from the circular point of\nview; so for q \u2208 Z we refer, without extra comment, to nq := nq1 , where q1 \u2208 {1, ..., m}\nis such that m|q \u2212 q1 . We denote by |B| the number of elements of a finite set B. For a\nhermitian symmetric domain D which is a disjoint union of the same connected hermitian\nsymmetric domain D0 , we denote by mid(D) the maximal (irreducible) dimension (as a\ncomplex manifold) of an irreducible factor of D0 , cf. [He, p. 381].\nOur main source of references on Shimura varieties is [Va2]. The expression (G, X)\nalways denotes a pair defining a Shimura variety, E(G, X) denotes its attached reflex field\nand Sh(G, X) denotes the Shimura variety defined by it, identified with the canonical\nmodel of the complex variety. For an arbitrary compact subgroup K of G(Af ), we\ndenote by ShK (G, X) or Sh(G, X)/K, the quotient of Sh(G, X) by K. Any x \u2208 X and\n\u03b1 \u2208 G(Af ) define a complex point [x, \u03b1] of ShK (G, X). As in this paper we encounter\nseveral quadruples and triples, the quadruples (resp. triples) introduced in [Va2, 3.2.6]\nare called Shimura quadruples (resp. triples). Warning: we use freely the notations and\nterminology of [Va2, 2.4 and 3.2.6]. For generalities on Shimura varieties of PEL type,\nwe refer to [Ko2, ch. 5] and to [Mi1, p. 161]; warning in last loc. cit. one needs to add\nthat the axiom [Mi1, (SV2)] holds. The embeddings in Siegel modular varieties defining\nShimura varieties of PEL type used in [Mi1, p. 161] are referred as PEL type embeddings.\nIf A is a set and f : A \u2192 A is an endomorphism of it, we denote by f m the m-times\ncomposite of f with itself; the identity bijection of A is denoted by 1A . If f : A \u2192 B and\ng : B \u2192 C are morphisms in some category we refer to g \u25e6 f as the composite of f with\ng. If 0 \u2192 A \u2192 B \u2192 C \u2192 0 is any short exact sequence, we refer to B as the extension\nof C by A.\nIf k is a field we denote by k\u0304 its algebraic closure. Let Gal(k) the group of automorphisms of k\u0304 acting identically on (the perfection of) k. For a field k of characteristic p,\nW (k) is the DVR of Witt vectors of k, while B(k) := W (k)[ p1 ] is the field of fractions\nof W (k). We denote Gal(B(k)) by \u0393k . \u03b1p is the finite, flat, commutative group scheme\nover k of rank p, defined as the kernel of the Frobenius endomorphism F : Ga \u2192 Ga .\nFor D a p-divisible group or a finite, flat, commutative group scheme over k, we denote\nby a(D) := dimk (Hom(\u03b1p , D)) its a-number. Occasionally, we use the Witt ring W (R),\nwith R an arbitrary k-algebra, and Wn (R) := W (R)/pn W (R).\nIn all that follows we assume k is perfect. We denote by \u03c3 (resp. \u03c3) the Frobenius\nautomorphism of W (k) and B(k) (resp. of W (k\u0304) and B(k\u0304)). Often, to avoid repetitions\nand for the sake of preciseness, we also denote \u03c3 by \u03c3k .\nBy a \u03c3-crystal (over k) we mean a pair (M, \u03c6), with M a free W (k)-module of finite\nrank and with \u03c6 a \u03c3-linear endomorphism of M which is a \u03c3-linear automorphism of\n52\n\n\fM [ p1 ]. We refer to (M, \u03c6n ) as a \u03c3 n -crystal. Warning: by a filtered \u03c3-crystal (over k)\nwe mean a triple (M, F 1 , \u03c6), with (M, \u03c6) a \u03c3-crystal and with F 1 a W (k)-submodule\nof M which is a direct summand of M such that \u03c6( p1 F 1 + M ) = M ; this convention\nis not standard but, as we often deal just with contexts involving p-divisible groups,\nit is very practical. We always denote by F 0 a direct supplement of F 1 in M . By a\nprincipal quasi-polarization of a \u03c3-crystal (M, \u03c6) we mean a perfect alternating form\n\u03c8 : M \u2297W (k) M \u2192 W (k) such that \u03c8(\u03c6(x), \u03c6(y)) = p\u03c3(\u03c8(x, y)), \u2200x, y \u2208 M . We often\nwrite it as \u03c8 : M \u2297W (k) M \u2192 W (k)(1).\nBy a \u03c3 n -isocrystal (over k) we mean a pair (M, \u03c6), with M a finite dimensional\nB(k)-vector space and with \u03c6 a \u03c3 n -linear automorphism of M . We still denote by \u03c6\nthe Frobenius endomorphism of any free W (k)-submodule or B(k)-vector subspace N\nof different tensor products (taken in any order) of a given number of copies of M with\na given number of copies of its dual M \u2217 , which is taken by \u03c6 into itself; here \u03c6 takes\nf \u2208 M \u2217 into \u03c3 n \u25e6 f \u25e6 \u03c6\u22121 \u2208 M \u2217 and acts in the usual tensor way on all such tensor\nproducts. Warning: if \u03c6 takes N into N , then \u2200m \u2208 N we make the convention that pm \u03c6\nacts on N via the rule: n \u2208 N is mapped into pm \u03c6(n); so pm \u03c6 is an abbreviation for\n(pm 1N ) \u25e6 \u03c6. In particular, \u03c6 takes e \u2208 End(M ) = M \u2297B(k) M \u2217 into \u03c6 \u25e6 e \u25e6 \u03c6\u22121 , while p\u03c6\ntakes e into p(\u03c6 \u25e6 e \u25e6 \u03c6\u22121 ). By a latticed \u03c3 n -isocrystal (over k) we mean a pair (M, \u03c6),\nwith M a free W (k)-module of finite rank, such that the pair (M [ p1 ], \u03c6) is a \u03c3 n -isocrystal.\nA morphism between two latticed \u03c3 n -isocrystals (M1 , \u03c61 ) \u2192 (M2 , \u03c62 ) is a W (k)-linear\nmap f : M1 \u2192 M2 such that by inverting p it is a morphism between \u03c3 n -isocrystals.\nWhen n = 1, we speak simply about (latticed) isocrystals (over k).\nAlways V0 denotes a Witt ring over an algebraically closed field of positive characteristic and then K0 automatically denotes its field of fractions. If v is a prime of a number\nfield E, we denote by k(v) the residue field of it and by O(v) the localization of the ring\nof integers of E with respect to it. The normalization of Z(p) in E is denoted by E(p) .\nb respectively its henselization, its strict\nIf O is a local ring, we denote by O h , O sh and O\nhenselization and its completion.\nWe usually write Z(p) instead of O(p) . The ring of finite ad\u00e8les \u1e90 \u2297Z Q is denoted by\nAf and the ring of finite ad\u00e8les with the p-component omitted is denoted by Apf . So we\nhave Af = Apf \u00d7 Qp . We use freely different Tate-twists: Q(1), Qp (1), Zp (1), Af (1) etc.\nWe denote by Fpd the field with pd elements (d \u2208 N) and by F its algebraic closure. If G\nis a reductive group over Q, then its torsion number t(G) \u2208 N is defined by\nY\nY\nt(G) :=\nt(GW (F) )\nt(GB(F) ).\np\u2208U (G)\n\np\u2208U\n/ (G), p a prime\n\nWe have: t\u0303(G) divides t(G). An integral, separated Fp -scheme is called perfect if it has\nan open, affine cover by spectra of perfect Fp -algebras.\nIf R is a faithfully flat Z(p) -algebra, we denote by R\u2227 its p-adic completion. Similarly,\nif X = Spec(R), with R as before, we denote X \u2227 := Spec(R\u2227 ).\nBy a p-adic formal scheme X we mean a formal scheme which locally can be obtained\nby completing a faithfully flat Z(p) -scheme along its special fibre. By a morphism from X\n53\n\n\finto another p-adic formal scheme Y or into a scheme Y , we mean a morphism f : X \u2192 Y\nof locally ringed spaces; we refer to f as a p-adic formal scheme over Y . So we have a\nnatural morphism X \u2192 Spec(Zp ). The fibre XZp /ps Zp is a scheme, \u2200s \u2208 N. If X is a\nflat Zp -scheme, we denote by X \u2227 the p-adic formal scheme it defines naturally. Warning:\nif X = Spec(R), then without a special reference X \u2227 denotes Spec(R\u2227 ); accordingly,\nwithout a special reference, the p-adic completion of an affine scheme (resp. of a morphism\nf between affine schemes) is viewed as an affine scheme (resp. as a morphism f \u2227 between\naffine schemes). The sheaf of local rings implicit in the definition of a scheme or of a\nformal scheme X, is denoted by OX . The category of locally free OX -sheaves of locally\nfinite ranks (resp. of coherent OX -sheaves) is denoted by LF (X) (resp. by (COH(X)).\nBy a geometric point of a scheme we mean a point of it with values in an algebraically\nclosed field.\nThe category of p-divisible groups (resp. of finite, flat, commutative group schemes\nof p power order) over a (formal) scheme S is denoted by p\u2212DG(S) (resp. by p\u2212F F (S)).\nThe reduced scheme of a scheme S is denoted Sred . If S is an Fp -scheme, then without a\nspecial reference on their type, all crystals and F -crystals on S are in locally free sheaves\nwhich locally have finite ranks and, if they are filtered, the filtrations are given by direct\nsummands. All F -crystals are such that by pulling them back through geometric points\nof S we get isocrystals over algebraically closed fields as defined above. If S is a Z(p) scheme (resp. W (k)-scheme) on which p is locally nilpotent, the crystalline site we use\nCRIS(S/Spec(Zp )) (resp. CRIS(S/Spec(W (k)))) is Berthelot's crystalline site as used\nin [Be, ch. III, \u00a74] and [BM]. The PD-structure on the ideal (p) of Zp (resp. of W (k)))\nis the usual one from characteristic 0.\nA morphism X1 \u2192 X of formal schemes is called \u00e9tale, if locally in their topology\nit is defined by a morphism Spf(A1 ) \u2192 Spf(A), where A (resp. A1 ) is complete with\nrespect to the topology defined by an ideal I of itself (resp. with respect to the topology\ndefined by its ideal IA1 ), such that the morphism Spec(A1 /I s A1 ) \u2192 Spec(A/I s ) is \u00e9tale,\n\u2200s \u2208 N. Similarly we define formally \u00e9tale morphisms between formal schemes.\nIf G is an affine group scheme over W (k), the W (k)-valued point of the p-adic\ncompletion of G or of the completion of G with respect to its origin, defined by the origin\nof G, is still referred as origin.\nLet K be an arbitrary field. By a stratification S of a reduced K-scheme S in\npotentially an infinite number of strata, we mean that:\na) for any field L which is either K or an algebraically closed field containing K\u0304 but\ndifferent from K\u0304, a set SL of disjoint reduced, locally closed subschemes of SL is given\nsuch that each L\u0304-valued point of S factors through an element of it;\nb) if i12 : L1 \u0592\u2192 L2 is an embedding between two fields as in a), then the pull back to\nL2 of any member of SL1 , is an element of SL2 (so we have a natural transition injective\nmap S(i12 ) : SL1 \u0592\u2192 SL2 ).\nMost of the time, we just mention how SK is constructed (as the constructions of\nSL 's and of S(i12 )'s are automatic). The inductive limit of all maps S(i12 ) is a class\n54\n\n\fwhich in general is not a set. We refer to it as the class of S. Each element of some\nSL is referred as a stratum of S. S is said to satisfy the purity property if for each L\nas above, any element of SL is an affine S-scheme; this is a more practical and general\ndefinition then any other one relying on codimension 1 statements on complements (of\ncourse, if S satisfies the purity property and SL is locally noetherian, then the Zariski\nclosure T1 of any irreducible component T0 of an element of SL in SL is such that T1 \\ T0\nis either empty or of pure codimension 1). Without a special reference, we always deal\nwith stratifications of S such that all transition injective maps S(i12 ) are bijections and\nSK is a finite set.\nBy a Frobenius lift of a Z(p) -scheme X (resp. of a Z(p) -algebra R) we mean an\nendomorphism of X (resp. of R) which mod p is the usual Frobenius endomorphism\n(for instance, for R/pR, it takes x \u2208 R/pR into xp ). If R and S are two arbitrary Z(p) algebras having Frobenius lifts \u03a6R : R \u2192 R and respectively \u03a6S : S \u2192 S, if M is a\nprojective R-module endowed with a \u03a6R -linear map \u03c6 : M \u2192 M , and if b : R \u2192 S is a\nZ(p) -homomorphism compatible with the mentioned Frobenius lifts, we denote by \u03c6 \u2297 1\nthe \u03a6S -linear map on M \u2297R S induced from \u03c6 via b. As above, if R is a flat Z(p) -algebra\nand if \u03c6 becomes an isomorphism by inverting p, we still denote by \u03c6 the \u03a6R -linear\nendomorphism of any R-submodule or R[ p1 ]-submodule of a tensor product of a number\nof copies of M [ p1 ] with a number of copies of its dual, taken by \u03c6 into itself. Moreover,\nwe use the same convention on pm \u03c6, m \u2208 N, as above (in the case R = W (k)).\nLet a, b \u2208 Z, b \u2265 a. Let S(a, b) := {a, a + 1, ..., b \u2212 1, b} and let SS(a, b) :=\n\u2207\n{a \u2212 b, a \u2212 b + 1, ..., b \u2212 a \u2212 1, b \u2212 a}. We denote by MF[a,b] (\u2217), MF (\u2217), MF[a,b]\n(\u2217) and\nMF \u2207 (\u2217) the categories introduced in [Fa1, ch. II]; here \u2217 \u2208 {R, X}. Whenever required\n(see loc. cit.), the p-adic completion of \u2217 is equipped with a Frobenius lift. We refer to\nthem as Fontaine categories (of objects); an arbitrary such category is often denoted as\nF C. We allow R (resp. X) to be (the p-adic completion of) a regular, formally smooth\nW (k)-algebra (resp. W (k)-scheme or p-adic formal scheme over W (k)). The objects of\nF C are denoted using tuples. For instance, fixing a Frobenius lift \u03a6R of R\u2227 , an object of\n\u2207\nMF[a,b]\n(R) is denoted as a quadruple (M, (F i(M ))i\u2208S(a,b) , (\u03c6i )i\u2208S(a,b) , \u2207): M is an Rmodule such that each element of it is annihilated by some power of p, (F i (M ))i\u2208S(a,b) is\na decreasing filtration of M , \u03c6i : F i (M ) \u2192 M is a \u03a6R -linear map, and \u2207 is a connection\non M (the axioms being as in loc. cit.). Warning: in 2.2.4 we adopt the (naive) point\nof view that all Fontaine categories are small, i.e. its morphisms are forming a set. This\ncan be fully formalized using the notion of universe as in [SGA4]; however, we prefer to\nkeep the requirements to the minimum and so we never mention such a universe (i.e. we\nthink that from the point of view of 2.2.4 J, the naive approach is \"enough\", as we can\nwork as well with skeletons of categories).\nWe always assume, for the sake of simplicity of presentation, that the R/pR-module\n\u03a9R/pR/k (resp. the OXk -sheaf \u03a9Xk /k ) of relative differentials is projective (resp. is\nlocally free) of locally finite rank in each point of Spec(R/pR) (resp. of Xk ). In what\nfollows we refer to [Fa1, 2.1], with R and X as in the above paragraph, without any\nother further comment: the proofs of loc. cit. apply entirely to the context we have\n55\n\n\fallowed (working in the faithfully flat topology we can assume R is a complete, local ring\nhaving an algebraically closed residue field; for this context the inductive argument on\ndimensions of loc. cit. applies entirely). We refer to [Fa1, 2.3] as the standard gluing\nprocess (or arguments) in the context of Fontaine categories involving connections (the\nword \"gluing\" is used for the first time in the last sentence of the paragraph before [Fa1,\ne) of p. 35]).\nWe can speak as well about Fontaine categories for regular, formally smooth, affine\nformal schemes (when allowed just formal schemes) over W (k), as well as we can replace\nW (k) by Wn (k) (in this last case we deal only with objects annihilated by pn in the\nlogical sense recalled in 2.2.1 c) below); the context of formal schemes (which are not\nnecessarily p-adic formal schemes) shows up just in 3.15.4.\nAs a policy, besides some definitions, we always start with some Fontaine category\ninvolving a scheme X and, as the constructions force us, we move to some Fontaine\ncategories involving a p-adic formal scheme over X. Just one exception: 3.6.18.4.2 is\nstated simultaneously in the context of schemes as well as of p-adic formal schemes.\nWe often refer to \u03a6R as a Frobenius lift of Spec(R) and so we write as well \u03a6R :\nSpec(R) \u2192 Spec(R). If r : W (k) \u2192 R is a Z(p) -homomorphism and \u03a6R (r(x)) = r(\u03c3(x)),\n\u2200x \u2208 W (k), we say \u03a6R is compatible with \u03c3. In what follows, we always assume that the\nFrobenius lifts of W (k)-algebras are compatible with \u03c3. The same applies to the context\nof regular, formally smooth (p-adic formal) schemes over W (k).\nWe use freely [Be, 1.6.5, p. 247] as well as its filtered version; accordingly, we have a\n\u2207\nnatural functor F[0,b] from the category MF[0,b]\n(X) to the category of filtered F -crystals\non Xk on coherent sheaves; here b \u2208 N \u222a {0} or b \u2208 S(0, p \u2212 1) depending on the fact\nthat X \u2227 is or is not equipped with a Frobenius lift. For instance, if X = Spec(R\u2227 ) and a\nFrobenius lift of X is fixed, then F[0,b] takes an object (M, (F i (M ))i\u2208S(0,b), (\u03c6i )i\u2208S(0,b) , \u2207)\n\u2207\nof MF[0,b]\n(X) into the filtered F -crystal on Xk whose evaluation at X is the quadruple\ni\n(M, (F (M ))i\u2208S(0,b), \u03c60 , \u2207) (the action of F[0,b] on morphisms being the logical one).\nFor fitting the convention of [De2, 1.1.6] on Hodge structures, the canonical split\n(cocharacters) of objects of p\u2212MF (W (k)) (see 2.2.1 c) for the definition of this category)\nto be used are the inverses of the ones defined in [Wi, p. 512]. So whenever we refer to\nthem we mean the inverses of the cocharacters of loc. cit., though they are still referred\nas canonical splits. We use freely (the functorial aspect of) loc. cit. in the formed\nmentioned.\nThe zero element of any module or ring is denoted by 0. For any finitely generated\nprojective module M over a commutative ring R, we denote by M \u2217 its dual. The R-span\n(i.e. the R-submodule of M ) generated by a finite number of elements e1 ,..., es of M , is\ndenoted by < e1 , ..., es >. We denote by M \u2297s \u2297R M \u2217\u2297t , with s, t \u2208 N \u222a {0}, the tensor\nproduct of s-copies of M with t-copies of M \u2217 taken in this order. If v \u2208 M \u2297s \u2297R M \u2217\u2297t ,\nwe denote by deg(v) := s + t its degree, and we call it a homogeneous tensor of degree\ns + t. By the essential tensor algebra of M \u2295 M \u2217 we mean\nT (M ) := \u2295s,t\u2208N\u222a{0} M \u2297s \u2297R M \u2217\u2297t .\n56\n\n\fWe do not use the natural structure of T (M ) as an R-algebra (it is non-commutative\nif the rank of M is at least 2 in some point of Spec(R)). We always identify End(M )\nwith M \u2297R M \u2217 . So End(End(M )) = End(M \u2297R M \u2217 ) = M \u2297R M \u2217 \u2297R M \u2217 \u2297R M is\nalways identified (by changing the order) with M \u22972 \u2297R M \u2217\u22972 . A family of tensors of\nT (M ) is denoted in the form (v\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J , with J as the set of indices; if all its tensors are\nhomogeneous of degree not greater than u \u2208 N \u222a {0}, we say it is of degree at most u. Let\nM1 be another finitely generated, projective R-module. Any isomorphism f : M \u2192M\n \u0303 1\nextends naturally to an isomorphism T (M )\u2192T\n \u0303 (M ) and so we often speak about f taking\nvj into some specific element of T (M1 ).\nIf M is endowed with a decreasing filtration by direct summands F i (M ), i \u2208 Z, then\nT (M ) gets naturally equipped with a filtration (called the tensor product filtration) by\ndirect summands; moreover, whenever we have a direct summand N of T (M ) such that\nits intersection with any direct summand F i (T (M )) of T (M ) which is part of its tensor\nproduct filtration, is a direct summand of N , we endow it with this intersection (also\ncalled induced) filtration; so F i (N ) := N \u2229 F i (T (M )), \u2200i \u2208 Z. We refer to F i (T (M ))\n(resp. to F i (M )) as the F i -filtration of T (M ) (resp. of M ). In particular, we often refer\nto the F 0 -filtration of T (M ) or of End(M ) or to the F 1 -filtration of End(M ). If F 1 is\na direct summand of M , by the F 0 -filtration of T (M ) defined by it, we mean the F 0 filtration of T (M ) defined by the filtration of M defined by: F 2 (M ) = {0}, F 1 (M ) = F 1\nand F 0 (M ) = M .\nAll filtrations of M to be considered are decreasing and such that F i (M ) = M for\ni << 0 and F j (M ) = {0} for j >> 0; so often we just mention those direct summands\nF i (M )'s which are different from {0} and M . Warning: this does not apply to Fontaine's\nrings of 2.3.18.1 E and of 4.9.2.0. By a range of a filtration of M we mean an interval\n[a, b], with a, b \u2208 Z, such that F a (M ) = M and F b+1 (M ) = {0}. If F 2 (M ) = {0} and\nF 0 (M ) = M , then we just mention the direct summand F 1 (M ), and we usually denote\nit (in a simpler way) by F 1 ; moreover, a direct supplement of F 1 in M is denoted by\nF 0 . If we use some lower right index j to denote the filtration of M (i.e. if we work with\nFji (M ), i \u2208 Z), then we automatically use the same type of index for all other filtrations\nintroduced in the above paragraph: we write Fji (T (M )), Fji (N ), etc. Warning: we still\nrefer to Fji (T (M )) as the F i -filtration of T (M ), etc. Similarly, the right lower indices\nare transfered in the context of F 1 and F 0 : we often consider Fj1 and a supplement of it\nFj0 in M .\nSimilarly, we define the essential tensor algebra T (F ) of F \u2295 F \u2217 , for a locally free\nOX -sheaf F of locally finite rank on a ringed space (X, OX ). If this ringed space is a\nscheme, then GL(F ) is the reductive group scheme over it of OX -linear automorphisms\nof F .\nA bilinear form on M is called perfect if it induces an isomorphism from M into its\ndual M \u2217 . A pair (M, \u03c8) with M as above and \u03c8 : M \u2297R M \u2192 R a perfect alternating\nform on it, is called a symplectic space over R. GL(M ), SL(M ), Sp(M, \u03c8), GSp(M, \u03c8),\netc., are viewed as group schemes over R; so, for an R-algebra R1 , GL(M )(R1 ) denotes\nthe group of R1 -valued points of GL(M ) (i.e. the group of R1 -linear automorphisms\n57\n\n\fof M \u2297R R1 ), etc. Warning: if G is a closed subgroup of GL(M ), we often identify a\nmorphism Spec(R1 ) \u2192 G, with a matrix automorphism of M \u2297R R1 ; in particular, we\noften refer to 1M as the identity element of G(R). If f1 and f2 are two Z-endomorphisms\nor automorphisms of M (or of the localization of M with respect to some element of\nR), most common we denote f1 \u25e6 f2 by f1 f2 . We usually use the same notation for\ntwo perfect bilinear forms if they are obtained one from another by an extension of\nscalars; the same applies to tensors of two essential tensor algebras obtained one from\nanother by an extension\nof scalars. If (W, \u03c8) is a symplectic space over Q, we denote\n\u0001\nby Sh GSp(W, \u03c8), S the Siegel modular variety associated to it (for instance, see [Va2,\nExample 2 of 2.5]).\nFor a finite field extension k0 \u0592\u2192 k and for a reductive group G over k, Resk/k0 G\ndenotes the group scheme over k0 obtained from G by Weil restriction of scalars (see\n[BLR, 7.6]). If f : G \u2192 G1 is a homomorphism of group schemes which is a closed\nembedding, then we identify G with its image (through f ) in G1 .\nWe use freely the terminology of Hodge cycles of abelian varieties over a field of\ncharacteristic 0 used in [De4] and, by natural extension, this terminology is also used\nfor abelian schemes over a reduced Q\u2013scheme S. Even more: if S is a reduced, flat\nZ(p) -scheme and A is an abelian scheme over S, we speak about Hodge cycles of A,\nthough strictly speaking, we should speak about Hodge cycles of the generic fibre of A.\nAny polarization of an arbitrary abelian scheme A is denoted by pA (sometimes PA )\nand, by abuse of notation, we also denote by pA the different maps on the cohomologies\n(homologies) of A induced by it. Pairs of the form (A, pA ) always denote a polarized\nabelian scheme. If S is a set of rational primes and if Z[ S1 ] is the subring of Q generated\nby Z and the inverses of all primes of S, then by a Z[ S1 ]-isogeny between two abelian\nschemes A1 and A2 defined over a scheme, we mean a Q\u2013isomorphism which induces an\nisomorphism A1 [N ]\u2192A\n \u0303 2 [N ], \u2200N \u2208 N which is relatively prime to all primes in S.\nWe consider an abelian scheme or a p-divisible group A over a scheme S. We denote\nby At its dual and by A[pn ] the kernel of its multiplication by pn . We now assume S is the\nspectrum of a perfect field k1 of positive characteristic p. By the \u03c3k1 -crystal (resp. by the\nisocrystal) of (or attached to) A we mean the \u03c3k1 -crystal defined by the first crystalline\ncohomology group of A with coefficients in W (k1 ) (resp. we mean the isocrystal over\nk1 defined by such a \u03c3k1 -crystal). Similarly, if S = Spec(W (k1 )), we speak about the\nfiltered \u03c3k1 -crystal of (or attached to) A. If S = Spec(k1 ), with k1 arbitrary, by the\nformal isogeny type of A, we mean the formal isogeny type (see [Man]) defined by the\nisocrystal of Ak1 . We use the notation (n, m) instead of the notation Gn,m of loc. cit; so\n(1, 1) is the formal isogeny type of (the isocrystal of) a supersingular elliptic curve, etc.\nIf S is the spectrum of a field of characteristic zero and if A is an abelian variety,\nthen we speak about the Shimura variety Sh(G, X) attached to A: choosing an arbitrary polarization pA of A, the Shimura pair (G, X) is defined as in [Va2, 2.12 3)]; it is\nindependent on the choice of pA .\nFor Artin's approximation theorem we refer to [BLR, p. 91]. We use it freely as\nwell as its intermediary form of [BLR, th. 12 of p. 83]. For classical Dieudonn\u00e9 theories\n58\n\n\fover k or W (k) we refer to [Fo]; mainly we need [Fo, p. 152 and 160 and \u00a75 of ch. 4].\nFor Lang's theorem on (torsors of) connected algebraic groups over finite fields, we refer\nto [Bo2, 16.3-4 and 16.6]. For standard properties and terminology of involutions on\nsemisimple algebras over fields we refer to [KMRT, ch. 1]. For the specialization theorem\n(of Grothendieck\u2013Katz) we refer to [Ka2, 2.3.1-2]. For Grothendieck's algebraization\ntheorem we refer to [EGA III, ch. 5]. For Serre\u2013Tate's deformation theory we refer to\n[Me, ch. 5] and [Ka3, ch. 1]. For Zariski's Main Theorem we refer to [Ra, ch. IV]. For\nthe ordinary conjecture concerning the ordinary reductions of an abelian variety over a\nnumber field, we refer to [Oo1, p. 11]. We use freely the fact that any regular, p-adically\ncomplete, formally smooth W (k)-algebra has Frobenius lifts.\nAll limits and colimits to be used are assumed to be filtered. Projective systems\nof (formal) schemes have affine transition morphisms. A projective limit of a projective\nsystem indexed in the standard manner by elements of N, is referred as an N-projective\nlimit, while the projective system itself is called an N-projective system; similarly we\nspeak about an N-inductive limit or system or about an N-pro-\u00e9tale scheme over another\nscheme. As the transition morphisms are affine, the projective limit of a projective system\nof formal scheme with \u00e9tale transition morphisms, does exist as as formal scheme. So\nsimilarly, we speak about an (N-) pro-\u00e9tale formal scheme over another formal scheme.\nOccasionally, we refer to the N-pro-\u00e9tale topology of a scheme: this can be defined\nentirely similar to the \u00e9tale topology. What we need: a property P pertaining to an\n\"object\" O over a scheme S is satisfied locally in the N-pro-\u00e9tale topology of S, if for\neach point y of S with values in a field there is an N-pro-\u00e9tale morphism S1 \u2192 S whose\nimage contains y, such that P holds for the (assumed to make sense) pull back of O to\nS1 . The same applies to the context of formal schemes.\nWe often refer to a Newton polygon being below, above, strictly below or strictly\nabove another one, in the usual sense (so the Newton polygon of a supersingular elliptic\ncurve over k is strictly above the Newton polygon of an ordinary elliptic curve over k).\nThe Newton polygon of a set of Newton polygons which is below all of them, is called the\nsmallest Newton polygon of the set. We use freely the specialization theorem to define\nstratifications using Newton polygons, even in a context where we are not dealing with an\nF -crystal over an Fp -scheme S but with \"modifications\" of such an F -crystal, where the\nFrobenius endomorphisms of modules over flat Zp -algebras associated naturally to it are\ndivided by the same positive, integral power of p. This applies in particular to the context\nof Lie F -crystals as to be defined below (for instance, see 2.2.2). In particular, we allow\nNewton polygons which have negative slopes and so, we deviate from the initial approach\nsuggested in [Va2, 1.6.2] of using Tate twists in order to get only non-negative slopes.\nBy the Newton polygon of a latticed isocrystal (M, \u03c6) we mean the Newton polygon of\n(M [ p1 ], \u03c6).\nThe set (often viewed as a matrix algebra over R) of m\u00d7m matrices with coefficients\nin R is denoted by Mm (R); the group of invertible such matrices is denoted by GLm (R).\nIf pR = {0} and B \u2208 Mm (R), then B [p] denotes the matrix whose entries are p-powers\nof entries of B.\n59\n\n\fMost common we avoid using \"an index to another index\"; for instance, if G1 (resp.\nG ) is a reductive Q-group, then its extension to Qp (resp. its derived subgroup) is\nder\nusually denoted by G1Qp (resp. by G1der ) and not by G1Qp (resp. by G1 ).\nFor the theories of healthy schemes and of different extension properties (like EP ,\nEEP , SEP , etc.) see [Va2, 3.2.1-3]. The expression \"with respect to\" is abbreviated as\nw.r.t. For minimal weights we refer to [Bou3, ch. 8, \u00a77.3], to [Sa] and to [De2, p. 261].\nFor the theory of well positioned families of tensors we refer to [Va2, 4.3.4-17] (see also\nAE.3 for the correction of [Va2, 4.3.6 3)]); we use freely the terminology of [Va2, 4.3.4].\n1\n\n2.2. Fontaine categories and Shimura crystals. In what follows we introduce\na language to be consistently used in \u00a72-14 as well as in the subsequent papers (like [Va312]). It is an \"interplay\" between the general, abstract contexts of Fontaine categories and\nthe particular, concrete contexts which have direct applications to the study of Shimura\nvarieties. Let k be an arbitrary perfect field of characteristic p > 0.\n2.2.1. Basic definitions and few comments. a) Let r \u2208 Q. An isocrystal\n(M, \u03c6) over k is said to be r-symmetric, if \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 Q such that r \u2212 \u03b1 is a slope of it, r + \u03b1\nis also a slope of it of the same multiplicity.\nb) We say that a k-scheme Xk :\n\u2013 has the ALP property, if the only open subscheme of it containing all its k\u0304-valued\npoints is Xk itself;\n\u2013 is an almost global (to be abbreviated as AG) k-scheme, if for any connected\ncomponent C of it there is a partition of the reduced scheme Cred in a finite number of\nreduced, locally closed subschemes, each stratum being an N-pro-\u00e9tale cover of a k-scheme\nof finite type.\nALP stands for \"algebraic points\". The ALP property is stable under pro-\u00e9tale\ncovers; so any AG k-scheme has the ALP property.\nc) Let R be a regular, formally smooth W (k)-algebra. We have in mind mainly the\ncase when Spec(R/pR) has the ALP property (like the case when Spec(R/pR) is a local\nor an AG k-scheme); but for the sake of generality we do not assume we are dealing just\nwith such a case. Let \u03a6R be a Frobenius lift of R (resp. of R\u2227 ).\nA finitely generated projective R-module (resp. R\u2227 -module) M , together with a\ndecreasing filtration (F i (M ))i\u2208Z of it by direct summands and a \u03a6R -linear endomorphism\n1\n1\n\u03c6 : M [ ] \u2192 M [ ],\np\np\nis said to be a p-divisible object of MF (R) if for any i \u2208 Z, \u03c6 restricted to F i (M ) is of\nthe form pi \u03c6i , with\n\u03c6i : F i (M ) \u2192 M,\nand the R-linear (resp. R\u2227 -linear) map\n\u03c6Z : \u2295i\u2208Z F\u0303 i (M ) \u2297R\n60\n\n\u03a6R R\n\n\u2192M\n\n\f(resp. \u03c6Z : \u2295i\u2208Z F\u0303 i (M ) \u2297R\u2227 \u03a6R R\u2227 \u2192 M ), whose restriction to the summand F\u0303 i (M ) \u2297R\ni\n\u2227\n\u03a6R R (resp. to F\u0303 (M ) \u2297R\u2227 \u03a6R R ) acts as \u03c6i \u2297 1, is an isomorphism; here, for i \u2208 Z,\ni\nF\u0303 (M ) is a direct supplement of F i+1 (M ) in F i (M ). We denote such a p-divisible object\nby a triple\nC := (M, (F i (M ))i\u2208Z , \u03c6).\nFor any n \u2208 N, M/pn M together with the filtration (F i (M )/pn F i (M ))i\u2208Z of it and\nthe induced family of \u03a6R -linear maps (\u03c6i )i\u2208Z is an object of MF (R) (we recall, cf. 2.1,\nthat F\u0303 i (M ) = {0} for i very big or very small); here we still denote by \u03c6i its reduction\nmod pn . We denote this object by C/pn C and we call it the truncation mod pn of C;\noften, for the sake of convenience, as \u03c6 and F i (M )'s determine \u03c6i 's, we denote it also by\nthe triple\n(M/pn M, (F i (M )/pn F i (M ))i\u2208Z , \u03c6)\ninstead of the triple (M/pn M, (F i (M )/pn F i (M ))i\u2208Z , (\u03c6i )i\u2208Z ); warning: here we do not\nthink of \u03c6 as some reduction modulo some power of p. We refer to M as the R-module\n(resp. the R\u2227 -module) underlying C and to M/pn M as the R/pn R-module underlying\nC/pn C. We refer to (F i (M ))i\u2208Z as the filtration underlying C, etc. Similarly, we speak\nabout the (filtered) module or sheaf (of modules) underlying an object of any Fontaine\ncategory and about the truncation mod pn of any such object; if an object is isomorphic\nto its truncation mod pn , we say it is annihilated by pn . If F 0 (M ) = M , then \u03c6 takes M\ninto M and we refer to it as a Frobenius endomorphism of M and we write \u03c6 : M \u2192 M .\nIf F 0 (M ) 6= M , then we refer to \u03c6 as the Frobenius endomorphism of M [ p1 ].\nThe notations MF (R) and MF (R\u2227) always denote the same category. Accordingly,\nif M is a projective R-module, we identify this p-divisible object C with the one obtained\nfrom it by the extension of scalars from R to R\u2227 ; in other words, we identify C with the\np-divisible object CR\u2227 := (M \u2297R R\u2227 , (F i (M ) \u2297R R\u2227 )i\u2208Z , \u03c6 \u2297 1), the Frobenius lift of R\u2227\nbeing the p-adic completion of \u03a6R . However, as we do not want to lose the information on\nC of being \"algebraizable\", we always prefer to work with C (resp. with C/pn C) instead\nof CR\u2227 (resp. of CR\u2227 /pn CR\u2227 ).\nIf C1 = (M1 , (F i (M1 ))i\u2208Z , \u03c61 ) is another such p-divisible object of MF (R) with M1\nan R-module (resp. an R\u2227 -module), then by a morphism from C to C1 , we mean an\nR-linear map q : M \u2192 M1 \u2297R R\u2227 (resp., when M and M1 are R\u2227 -modules, we mean\nan R\u2227 -linear map q : M \u2192 M1 ) respecting the filtrations and Frobenius endomorphisms.\nNotation:\nC \u2192 C1 .\nThe Zp -module of morphisms from C to C1 is denoted by Hom(C, C1 ). We get the category\np \u2212 MF (R) of p-divisible objects of MF (R); it is a Zp -linear category.\nWarning: a p-divisible object of MF (R) is not a particular type of object of MF (R)\n(of course, it is an object of p \u2212 MF (R)); it is (i.e. it can be identified with) a suitable Nprojective system of objects of MF (R). In other words, we can identify (cf. definitions)\nC with the naturally obtained N-projective system defined by C/pn C, n \u2208 N. So the\ncategory p \u2212 MF (R) is equivalent to a full subcategory of the category N \u2212 pro \u2212 MF (R)\n61\n\n\fof N-projective systems of objects of MF (R); we rarely use this equivalence, as we think\nthe notations involving projective R-modules (resp. R\u2227 -modules) are much simpler than\nthe ones involving N-projective systems.\nIf moreover we fix a family of tensors (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J of the F 0 -filtration of T (M [ p1 ]) fixed\nby \u03c6, then we speak about a p-divisible object with tensors of MF (R). Notation: a\nquadruple (M, (F i (M ))i\u2208Z , \u03c6, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ) or a pair (C, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ).\n\u2207\nWe also speak about p-divisible objects (with tensors) of MF[a,b] (R), of MF[a,b]\n(R)\n\u2207\nor of MF (R), or about p-divisible objects (with tensors) of MF[a,b] (X), etc., with\na, b \u2208 Z, b \u2265 a, and with X a regular, formally smooth W (k)-scheme (resp. a regular,\nformally smooth p-adic formal scheme over W (k)). Warning: in this last case (pertaining\nto X) the tensors are global sections of sheaves of the form T (F )\u2297Z(p) Q, with F a locally\nfree OX \u2227 -sheaf (resp. OX -sheaf) of locally finite rank. Without specific references, we\nalways assume that either X itself or its p-adic completion is equipped with a Frobenius\nlift or we are in a situation where the standard gluing process of [Fa1, 2.3] applies, i.e.\n\u2207\nwe are in the context of MF[a,b]\n(X), with b \u2212 a \u2264 p \u2212 1 (however, see 2.2.4 C and\nD for natural extensions). Warning: as the connections involving objects of MF \u2207 (X)\nare p-nilpotent (see [Fa1, p. 34]), the restriction p > 2 in (the proof of) [Fa1, 2.3] is not\nneeded; so in what follows, we refer to loc. cit. and its proof without extra comment even\nfor p = 2. We also speak about Zp -linear categories defined by such p-divisible objects\n(resp. by N-projective systems of objects): p \u2212 MF[a,b] (R) (resp. N \u2212 pro \u2212 MF[a,b] (R)),\netc. When we speak about a p-divisible object with tensors of MF \u2207 (R), etc., we require\nthe tensors to be (as well) horizontal, i.e. to be annihilated by the (natural extension\nto T (M ) of the) connection involved. We speak as well about truncations of p-divisible\nobjects of MF[a,b] (R), or of MF \u2207 (R), etc.\nWe recall from 2.1, that whenever we deal with some (object or p-divisible object of\na) Fontaine category involving a regular, formally smooth (p-adic formal) scheme Y over\nW (k), we always assume \u03a9Yk /k is a locally free OYk -sheaf of locally finite rank. Warning:\nas we allowed R (or X) to be regular, formally smooth (and not only smooth) over W (k),\nsome precautions are in order. In the case of a p-divisible object of MF \u2207 (R), we work\nwith the p-adic completion \u03a9\u2227\nR/W (k) of the R-module of relative differentials \u03a9R/W (k) of R\nover W (k); the same applies in the context of X. For instance, if R = W (k)[[z1 , ..., zm ]],\nm \u2208 N, and if M is a free R-module of finite rank, then all connections\n\u2207 : M \u2192 M \u2297W (k) \u03a9R/W (k)\nto be considered, factor through M \u2297R \u03a9\u0304R/W (k) , where \u03a9\u0304R/W (k) is the free R-submodule of\n\u03a9R/W (k) generated by dz1 ,..., dzm ; we have a natural identification \u03a9\u0304R/W (k) = \u03a9\u2227\nR/W (k) .\nA p-divisible object of MF \u2207 (R) is denoted as a quadruple (M, (F i(M ))i\u2208Z , \u03c6, \u2207)\nor as a pair (C, \u2207), where C is as above; warning: due to the conventions of the previous\nparagraph, we always consider M to be an R\u2227 -module.\nWe use freely tensor products of (p-divisible) objects of some Fontaine category,\nwhenever they are defined (when we are dealing with a Fontaine category of objects\n62\n\n\finvolving filtrations in a fixed range, like MF[a,b] (R), then such tensor products might\nbe defined just in a \"larger\" Fontaine category, like MF (R)). For instance, if above M\nand M1 are R\u2227 -modules, C \u2297R\u2227 C1 is the p-divisible object of MF (R) whose underlying\nfiltered R\u2227 -module is M \u2297R\u2227 M1 endowed with the tensor product filtration, the Frobenius\nendomorphism of M [ p1 ] \u2297R\u2227 [ p1 ] M1 [ p1 ] = M \u2297R\u2227 M1 [ p1 ] being \u03c6 \u2297 \u03c61 .\nWe speak about a principal quasi-polarization of a p-divisible object of MF[0,1](R)\n\u2207\nor of MF[0,1]\n(R). For instance, if C = (N, F 1 , \u03c6) is a p-divisible object of MF[0,1](R)\nwith N an R\u2227 -module, the dual C\u2217 of C is a p-divisible object of MF[\u22121,0] (R) and so\nC\u2217 (1) is a p-divisible object of MF[0,1](R); so by a principal quasi-polarization of C, we\nmean an isomorphism\niC : C\u2192C\n \u0303 \u2217 (1)\nproducing a perfect alternating form\npC : C \u2297R\u2227 C \u2192 R\u2227 (1)\n(pC is a morphism in the category p \u2212 MF[0,2](R)). Here, for m \u2208 Z,\nR\u2227 (m) := R\u2227 \u2297W (k) W (k)(m)\nis the p-divisible object of MF[m,m] (R) defined by the R\u2227 -module R\u2227 and the \u03a6R -linear\nmap of R\u2227 [ p1 ] which takes 1 into pm . Usually we identify canonically iC with pC; we\nrefer to the pair (C, pC) or to the quadruple (N, F 1 , \u03c6, pN ) (with pN : N \u2297R\u2227 N \u2192 R\u2227\ndefining pC) as a principally quasi-polarized p-divisible object of MF[0,1](R). We often\nwrite pN : N \u2297R\u2227 N \u2192 R\u2227 (1). The truncation mod pn of R\u2227 (m) is also denoted as\nR/pn R(m).\nSimilarly, we speak about principally quasi-polarized objects of MF[0,1] (R) or of\n\u2207\nMF[0,1]\n(R); most commonly we get such principally quasi-polarized objects by taking\ntruncations (modulo some integral positive power of p) of principally quasi-polarized p\u2207\ndivisible objects (of MF[0,1] (R) or of MF[0,1]\n(R)). The last two paragraphs apply as\nwell in the context of X.\nd) A p-divisible object C = (M, (F i (M ))i\u2208S(a,b) , \u03c6) of MF[a,b] (W (k)) is said to be\ncyclic diagonalizable if M 6= {0} and there is a W (k)-basis B = {ei |i \u2208 A} of M , with\nA := S(1, dimW (k) (M )), such that the following two conditions hold:\ni) \u2200i \u2208 S(a, b), a subset of B is a W (k)-basis of F i (M );\nii) there is a permutation \u03c0 of A with the property that \u03c6(ei ) = pn(i) e\u03c0(i) , \u2200i \u2208 A, where\nn(i) \u2208 S(a, b) is uniquely determined by requesting ei \u2208 F n(i) (M ) \\ F n(i)+1 (M ).\nWhen \u03c0 = 1A we drop the word cyclic. If \u03c0 is an |A|-cycle, then we often replace\nthe word cyclic by circular.\nSimilarly, we speak about the truncation mod pn of C of being cyclic (or circular)\ndiagonalizable; keeping i) we just need to replace in ii) the equality \u03c6(ei ) = pn(i) e\u03c0(i) by\n63\n\n\fthe requirement that \u03c6n(i) (ei ) mod pn is e\u03c0(i) mod pn ; here \u03c6i 's are obtained from \u03c6 as\nin c).\ne) Let O be a DVR and let u be a uniformizer of it. If S is an O-scheme, then an\nOS -sheaf is said to have the DC property (here DC stands for direct cyclic) if it is a finite\ndirect sum of OS -sheaves of the form OS /un OS , with n \u2208 N \u222a {0}. Similarly, if R is an\nO-algebra, then an R-module is said to have the DC property if as an OSpec(R) -sheaf it\nhas the DC property. If we allow n to be \u221e as well (with OS /u\u221e OS := OS ), then we\nspeak about the EDC property, with E standing for extended.\nf ) We refer to the morphism C \u2192 C1 of c). We denote it by q. We assume M and M1\nare R\u2227 -modules. q is called an epimorphism or a monomorphism if q is so. q is called an\nisogeny if q becomes an isomorphism by inverting p and moreover there is m \u2208 N such that\nq(M ) contains pm M1 . If q after inverting p is an isomorphism, then we define Coker(q)\nas follows. We can assume Xk is connected. Let n \u2208 N. M2 := M1 /q(M ) is p-adically\ncomplete. Moreover, M2 /pn M2 locally has the DC property (being the underlying R\u2227 module of Coker(C/pn C \u2192 C1 /pn C1 ), cf. [Fa1, p. 31-33]). So, as M2 [ p1 ] = {0} and as\nXk is connected, using a Teichm\u00fcller lift of Spec(R\u2227 ) with values in the Witt ring of a\nperfect field, we get that we can assume pn M2 = {0}. So we take:\nCoker(q) := Coker(C/pn C \u2192 C1 /pn C1 );\nit is well defined independently of the choice of n (subject to pn M2 = {0}). The same\napplies to all other Fontaine categories of p-divisible objects.\nSimilarly, if C (resp. C1 ) is a p-divisible object (resp. an object annihilated by pn )\nof the same Fontaine category F C, then the torsion Zp -module\nHom(C, C1 ) := HomF C (C/pn C, C1 )\nis well defined independently of the choice of n (subject to the mentioned property) and\nany element q of it is referred as a morphism C \u2192 C1 . If at the level of underlying\nmodules q is an epimorphism, we say q is an epimorphism and we refer to C as a lift of\nC1 ; if moreover the resulting epimorphism C/pC \u2192 C1 is an isomorphism, we refer to C\nas a strict lift of C1 .\n2.2.1.0. The crystalline, contravariant Dieudonn\u00e9 functor in the language of Fontaine categories. The initial motivation for using (p-divisible objects of)\nFontaine categories, stems from the existence of the crystalline, contravariant Dieudonn\u00e9\nfunctor D. Let X, R and \u03a6R : R\u2227 \u2192 R\u2227 be as in 2.2.1 c).\nWe have a contravariant, Zp -linear functor\n\u2207\np \u2212 DG(X) \u2192 p \u2212 MF[0,1]\n(X).\n\nIts existence is a particular case of Grothendieck\u2013Messing theory (see [Me, ch. 4-5]), via\na natural limit process; in other words, the functor associates to a p-divisible group D\n64\n\n\f\u2207\nover X the p-divisible object of MF[0,1]\n(X) defined naturally by the N-projective system\n\u2207\nof objects of MF[0,1]\n(X), whose object corresponding to n \u2208 N is annihilated by pn\nand is naturally defined (via reduction mod pn ) by the dual of the Lie algebra of the\nuniversal vector extension of the pull back (warning!) of D[pn+1 ] to X \u00d7W (k) Wn+1 (k).\nSuch a functor is also constructed in [BBM, ch. 3]. In [BM, ch. 3] it is shown the\ncompatibility of the two constructions (warning: [BM, 3.2.11] applies here even for p = 2\ndue to the fact that we are not dealing with crystals on CRIS(XWn+1 (k) /Spec(W (k)))\nbut just with locally free OXWn+1 (k) -sheaves obtained by evaluated them at XWn+1 (k) ).\nFollowing [BBM, ch. 3], this functor is denoted by D.\nWe recall briefly the construction of D, in the wider (in fact intermediary) context of\np \u2212 F F (X), i.e. of finite, flat, commutative group schemes of p-power order over X. Let\nG and G\u0303 be such group schemes. We first assume that X = Spec(R\u2227 ), that G (resp. G\u0303)\nis a closed subgroup of an abelian scheme A (resp. \u00c3) over R\u2227 and that there is m \u2208 N\nsuch that both G and G\u0303 are annihilated by pm . Let A1 := A/G. Let C (resp. C1 ) be the\n\u2207\np-divisible object of MF[0,1]\n(R) naturally defined by A (resp. by A1 ). We recall that the\n\u2227\n1\nunderlying R -module of C is Hcrys\n(A/R\u2227 ) and is naturally equipped with a \u03a6R -linear\n1\nendomorphism, that the filtration of Hcrys\n(A/R\u2227 ) is the Hodge filtration, and that the\n1\n\u2227\nconnection on Hcrys (A/R ) is the p-adic completion of the Gauss\u2013Manin connection.\nSimilarly, we get C1 .\nNow (cf. [Fo] for the particular case R = W (k) and cf. [BBM, 3.1.2] for the general\ncase; see also [BM, p. 190-1])\n\nD(G) = (M, F 1 , \u03a60 , \u03a61 , \u2207)\nis defined as the cokernel (see 2.2.1 f)) of the isogeny C1 \u0592\u2192 C associated to the natural\nisogeny A \u0589 A1 . M is annihilated by pm .\nSimilarly we define D(G\u0303). If fG : G \u2192 G\u0303 is a homomorphism, then the homomorphism (1G , fG ) : G \u2192 G \u00d7 G\u0303 is a closed emebedding. So D(fG ) : D(G\u0303) \u2192 D(G) is defined\nnaturally via the epimorphism\nD(G) \u2295 D(G\u0303) = D(G \u00d7 G\u0303) \u0589 D(G)\nassociated naturally to (1G , fG ); here D(G \u00d7 G\u0303) is computed via the product embedding\nof G \u00d7 G\u0303 in A \u00d7 \u00c31 . One checks that D(G) and D(fG ) are well defined (i.e. do not depend\non the choices made) in the standard diagonal way. For instance, if G is a closed subgroup\nof another abelian scheme B over R\u2227 , then by embedding G diagonally in A \u00d7R\u2227 B, we\nget (via standard arguments involving the snake lemma in the context of any one of the\ntwo projections of A \u00d7R\u2227 B onto its factors) that D(G) defined via A \u00d7R\u2227 B is canonically\nisomorphic to D(G) defined via A or B.\nTo define D(G) in general, we use Raynaud's theorem of [BBM, 3.1.1]: locally in the\nZariski topology of X, G is a subgroup of an abelian scheme and is annihilated by pm for\nsome m \u2208 N; so D(G) is defined as above, via standard arguments of gluing (based on\nthe previous paragraph).\n65\n\n\fWarning: in [BBM], [BM] or [dJ1-2] the language of Fontaine categories is not used.\nReferring to the case X = Spec(R\u2227 ), the mentioned places (with [BBM, ch. 3] as the main\nreference) are using instead of the \u03a6R -linear map \u03a61 : F 1 \u2192 M , a Verschiebung R\u2227 -linear\nmap V : M \u2192 M \u2297R\u2227 \u03a6R R\u2227 ; identifying \u03a61 with an R\u2227 -linear map F 1 \u2297R \u03a6R R\u2227 \u2192 M ,\nwe have\nV \u25e6 \u03a61 (x) = x,\n\n(V P HION E)\n\u2200x \u2208 F 1 \u2297R\u2227\nwe have\n\n\u03a6R R\n\n\u2227\n\n. Similarly, identifying \u03a60 with an R\u2227 -linear map M \u2297R\n\n\u03a6R R\n\n\u2227\n\n\u2192 M,\n\nV \u25e6 \u03a60 (x) = px,\n\n(V P HIZERO)\n\u2200x \u2208 M \u2297R\u2227\n\n\u03a6R R\n\n\u2227\n\n. As M is generated by the images of \u03a61 and \u03a60 , we get:\n\nFact 1. V is uniquely determined by \u03a60 and \u03a61 .\nSo we feel it is appropriate to denote (M, F 1 , \u03a60 , \u03a61 , \u2207) by D(G); so in what follows,\n(the functor) D is used for p \u2212 F F (X) as well as for p \u2212 DG(X).\nIf now D is a p-divisible group over X, then D(D) is the N-projective system defined naturally by D(D[pn ]), n \u2208 N: one checks that the underlying OX /pn OX -sheaf\nof D(D[pn ]) is projective of rank equal to the rank of D and D(in ) is an epimorphism,\n\u2200n \u2208 N; here in : D[pn ] \u0592\u2192 D[pn+1 ] is the natural inclusion. Argument: based on [Fa1,\n2.1 ii)], using Teichm\u00fcller lifts (of open, affine subschemes of X endowed with a Frobenius lift) it is enough to consider the case when X = Spec(W (k)). But this case is a\nconsequence of the classical Dieudonn\u00e9 theory. We get the first sentence of:\nFact 2. D(D)/pn D(D) is naturally identifiable with D(D[pn ]). It depends only on\nthe pull back of D[pn+1 ] to XWn+1 (k) .\nThe second sentence follows from the above part referring to [Me] or to the connection\nbetween V and \u03a61 .\nThe language to be used in what follows: to any p-divisible group D over X (resp.\nover Spec(R) or Spec(R\u2227 )) it corresponds (or it is associated) a p-divisible object D(D) of\n\u2207\n\u2207\nMF[0,1]\n(X) (resp. of MF[0,1]\n(R)); similarly, we say: to a finite, flat, commutative group\nscheme G of p-power order over X (resp. over Spec(R) or Spec(R\u2227 )) it corresponds (or\n\u2207\n\u2207\nit is associated) an object D(G) of MF[0,1]\n(X) (resp. of MF[0,1]\n(R)).\nWhenever D is uniquely determined by D(D), we also say D is associated to D(D);\n[BM, \u00a74] and [Me, ch. 4-5] can be combined to give plenty of situations, with p > 2, in\nwhich D is uniquely determined by D(D).\n2.2.1.1. Remarks. 1) One might wonder if the terminology p-divisible objects is\nthe right one. Our justification is: the below philosophies of 2) and of 3.6.18.5.1. We do\nthink that:\n66\n\n\f\u2013 the terminology \"Barsotti\u2013Tate objects\" would have complicated very much the\nterminology (for instance, later on \u2013see 2.2.8 3)\u2013 we introduce Shimura p-divisible objects);\n\u2013 the terminology \"formal objects\" would have forced us to always be in a formal\ncontext and moreover it would have not allowed us to speak about p-adic formal schemes\nas a way of emphasizing the type of formal schemes we are mostly dealing with;\n\u2013 the terminology \"torsion free objects\" offers some advantages (i.e. in some sense\nit is more accurate) but using it the results below would have been significantly less\nuniformly stated;\n\u2013 the terminology of [FL, \u00a71] used for the case of W (k) is neither practical nor\naccurate for the general cases of R's and X's as in 2.2.1 c) (that is why [Fa1] speaks just\nabout objects).\n2) If p > 2 and X is the p-adic completion of a smooth W (k)-scheme, then [Fa1,\n7.1] can be restated as follows. The contravariant, Zp -linear functor\n\u2207\nD : p \u2212 F F (X) \u2192 MF[0,1]\n(X)\n\u2207\nis an antiequivalence of categories. This implies: D : p \u2212 DG(X) \u2192 p \u2212 MF[0,1]\n(X) is an\n\u22121\nantiequivalence of categories. So occasionally, we refer to D .\n3) In general, the categories of objects or p-divisible objects introduced in 2.2.1 c)\n\u2207\ndo depend on the choice of Frobenius lifts. However, the category MF[0,p\u22121]\n(X) does\nnot depend (up to canonical isomorphisms) on such choices, cf. [Fa1, 2.3]. One of the\nmain advantages of working with p-divisible objects instead of objects is:\n\u2207\nFact. p \u2212 MF[a,b]\n(X) (as well as p \u2212 MF \u2207 (X)) does not depend (up to canonical\nisomorphism) on the choice of a Frobenius lift of X.\n\nThis is a consequence of the fact that, when we have no p-torsion involved, canonical\nisomorphisms can be constructed as in loc. cit. Argument: we can assume a = 0 and so,\nto check that some gluing maps (constructed as in [De3, 1.1.3.4] using Taylor series) do\ndefine isomorphisms, we can work locally in the faithfully flat topology; for the case of\nX = Spec(W (k)[[x1 , ..., xm ]]) we refer to loc. cit.\n\u2207\nWe always identify p \u2212 MF[0,b]\n(X) with a full subcategory of the category of filtered\n\u2207\nF -crystals on Xk (to be compared with the case of MF[0,b]\n(X) of 2.1); here b \u2208 N \u222a {0}.\n4) Any cyclic diagonalizable p-divisible object is a direct sum of circular ones. Moreover, any circular diagonalizable p-divisible object has a unique slope.\n5) MF (X) and MF (X \u2227 ) denote the same category of objects; the same applies\nto all other Fontaine categories of objects or of p-divisible objects. Moreover, we always\n\u2207\nidentify MF[a,b] (X) (resp. MF[a,b]\n(X)) with a full subcategory of MF[a\u2032 ,b\u2032 ] (X) (resp.\n\u2207\nof MF[a\u2032 ,b\u2032 ] (X)) and of MF (X) (resp. of MF \u2207 (X)), where a\u2032 \u2264 a \u2264 b \u2264 b\u2032 are integers.\nAlso, we always identify MF (R) with MF (Spec(R)), etc. Warning: the natural functor\n\u2207\nF ORG : MF[a,b]\n(X) \u2192 MF[a,b] (X)\n\n67\n\n\fwhich \"forgets connections\" is not full in general.\n6) All Fontaine categories of 2.2.1 c) involving objects are abelian, cf. [Fa1, Cor. of\np. 33] (it extends automatically to the context involving connections). This is not true for\nthe context of p-divisible objects (the problem being with cokernels). However, it is trivial\nto see that all Fontaine categories of 2.2.1 c) involving p-divisible objects have kernels,\nimages and arbitrary finite fibre products. Moreover, if a, b, R and \u03a6R : R\u2227 \u2192 R\u2227 are\nas in 2.2.1 c), we have:\nFact. Locally in the Zariski topology of R, any object of MF[a,b] (R) is annihilated\nby p for some n \u2208 N and is the cokernel of an isogeny between two p-divisible objects of\nMF[a,b] (R).\nn\n\nProof: Let C1 := (M, (F i (M ))i\u2208S(a,b) , (\u03c6i )i\u2208S(a,b) ) be an object of MF[a,b] (R). We\nchoose a direct summand F\u0303 i (M ) of F i+1 (M ) in F i (M ), cf. [Fa1, 2.1 i)], i \u2208 S(a, b).\nLocalizing, we can assume M = \u2295j\u2208S(1,m) R/pnj R, with m \u2208 N \u222a {0} and all nj 's in N,\ncf. [Fa1, 2.1 ii)]. So we can take n := max{nj |j \u2208 S(1, m)}.\nLocalizing further on we can assume all F\u0303 i (M )'s have the DC property. The argument goes as follows. F\u0303 i (M )/pF\u0303 i (M )'s are projective R/pR-modules and so localizing\nwe can assume they are free. We work with a fixed i \u2208 S(a, b). By induction on n,\ni\nwe can assume pF\u0303 i (M ) has the DC property. Let {e1i , ..., em\ni }, with mi \u2208 N \u222a {0}, be\na set of elements of F\u0303 i (M ) such that pF\u0303 i (M ) is a direct sum of the cyclic R-modules\ngenerated by peji , j \u2208 S(1, mi ), and the annihilator of each such peji is an ideal of R\ngenerated by a positive, integral power of p. This implies that the R/pR-submodule of\nF\u0303 i (M )/pF\u0303 i (M ) generated by the images of eji 's is free of rank mi ; it is easy to see that\ni +1\nis as well a direct summand. So let {em\n, ..., eqi i } be a set of elements of F\u0303 i (M ) such\ni\nthat the images of eji , j \u2208 S(1, qi ), in F\u0303 i (M )/pF\u0303 i (M ) are forming an R/pR-basis of this\nfree R/pR-module. By replacing each eji , with j \u2208 S(mi + 1, qi ), by a linear combination\nof esi 's, with s \u2208 S(1, mi ), we can assume peji = 0, \u2200j \u2208 S(mi + 1, qi ). Let s(i, j) \u2208 N be\nsuch that ps(i,j) R is the annihilator of eji , j \u2208 S(1, qi ). We get: F\u0303 i (M ) is (isomorphic to)\nthe direct sum \u2295j\u2208S(1,qi ) (R/ps(i,j)R)eji .\nWe now consider the free R\u2227 -module MR having as an R\u2227 -basis a set formed by\nelements fij , i \u2208 S(a, b) and j \u2208 S(1, qi ). We consider the R\u2227 -epimorphism\nq : MR \u0589 M\nthat takes each fij into eji . For i \u2208 S(a, b), let F i (MR ) be the R\u2227 -submodule of MR\ngenerated by those fij\u2032 , with i\u2032 \u2208 S(i, b) and j \u2208 S(1, qi\u2032 ). F i (MR ) \u2229 Ker(q) is a free\n\u2032\nR\u2227 -module having {ps(i ,j) fij\u2032 |i\u2032 \u2208 S(i, b) and j \u2208 S(1, qi\u2032 )} as an R\u2227 -basis. We consider\na \u03a6R -linear endomorphism \u03c6 of MR [ p1 ] that takes fij into pi gij , where gij \u2208 MR is an\n\narbitrary element with the property that q(gij ) = \u03c6i (eji ). The elements gij , i \u2208 S(a, b)\nand j \u2208 S(1, qi ), generate MR , as this is so mod p (q mod p being an isomorphism). So\nthe triple (MR , (F i (MR ))i\u2208S(a,b) , \u03c6) is a p-divisible object C of MF[a,b] (R). Moreover,\nfrom the very construction q defines a morphism C \u2192 C1 and so (cf. also on the above\n68\n\n\fpart on Ker(q)) Ker(q) is the underlying R\u2227 -module of a p-divisible subobject C2 of C.\nObviously C1 is the cokernel of the natural inclusion C2 \u0592\u2192 C. This proves the Fact.\nFrom the part of the proof referring to F\u0303 i (M ) having the DC property, we get:\nCorollary. An R-module has the DC property iff R/pR and pR have it.\nExercise. Show that the kernel of a morphism from a p-divisible object into an\nobject of the same Fontaine category FC is well defined and is a p-divisible object of FC.\nHint: use the fact that FC is an abelian category and the above proof.\n7) If F C is a Fontaine category of objects, we denote by F C[pn ] (resp. by p \u2212 F C)\nits full subcategory formed by objects annihilated by pn (resp. the category of p-divisible\nobjects of F C). We refer to it as a Fontaine category of objects annihilated by pn or as\nthe truncation mod pn of F C (resp. as the Fontaine category of p-divisible objects of\nF C). The operation of taking truncations mod pn can be viewed as a functor\nT Rn (F C) : p \u2212 F C \u2192 F C[pn ].\nCorollary. If F C = MF (R) with R local, then T R1 (F C) is essentially surjective.\nProof: The proof of 6) implies T R1 (F C) is surjective on objects; but its arguments\ncan be used as well for morphisms. This ends the proof.\nWe assume Xk has a finite number of connected components. Let F C be any one\n\u2207\nof the following four categories: MF (X), MF \u2207 (X), MF[a,b] (X) or MF[a,b]\n(X). Let\nq : C \u0592\u2192 C1 be a monomorphism of p \u2212 F C. We have:\nFact. There is a canonical epimorphism e : C1 \u0589 C2 of p \u2212 F C such that e \u25e6 q = 0\nand the factorization C \u0592\u2192 Ker(e) is an isogeny.\nProof: Based on the canonical aspect of the Fact, we can work locally and so we can\nassume X = Spec(R), with R local and as in 2.2.1 c). The proof in the context involving\nconnections is entirely the same. So not to introduce extra notations we assume we are in\nthe context of q of 2.2.1 c), with M and M1 as R\u2227 -modules and with q a monomorphism.\nLet M1\u2032 := {x \u2208 M1 |pn x \u2208 q(M ) for some n \u2208 N}. The quotient module\nM2 := M1 /M1\u2032\nis a locally free R\u2227 -module. The argument for this goes as follows. M1 /q(M ) is p-adically\ncomplete and so is the N-projective limit of M1 /pn M1 +q(M )'s, n \u2208 N. M1 /pn M1 +q(M )\nis the underlying R-module of the kernel of the truncation mod pn of q and so it has the\nDC property. We write it as the direct sum of a free R/pn R-module M1 (n) and of an\nR/pn\u22121 R-module N1 (n). There is n0 \u2208 N such that N1 (n) = N1 (n0 ), \u2200n \u2265 n0 : this can\nbe seen using Teichm\u00fcller lifts (one for each connected component of Spec(R\u2227 ); the Fact\nis trivial for Witt rings as we can argue at the level of lattices). So for n \u2265 n0 , we have\nM1 (n + 1)/pn M1 (n + 1) = M1 (n). So M2 is the projective limit of M1 (n)'s and so is\na free R\u2227 -module. We also get that we can identify M1 /q(M ) with N1 (n0 ) \u2295 M2 . The\n69\n\n\fsame arguments apply for filtrations: the image of F i (M1 ) in M1 /q(M ) = N1 (n0 ) \u2295 M2\nis a direct sum of a direct summand of N1 (n0 ) and of a direct summand F i (M2 ) of M2 ,\n\u2200i \u2208 Z.\nFor i \u2208 Z, the \u03a6R -linear endomorphism of the image of F i (M ) in M1 /q(M ) naturally\ndefined by p\u2212i \u03c61 takes F i (M2 ) into M2 (as \u03c61 becomes an isomorphism after inverting p).\nIt is easy to see that this implies that M2 together with (F i (M2 ))i\u2208Z and the \u03a6R -linear\nendomorphism of M2 [ p1 ] defined naturally by \u03c61 is an object C2 of p \u2212 F C and moreover\nthe R\u2227 -epimorphism M1 \u0589 M2 defines an epimorphism e : C1 \u0589 C2 of p \u2212 F C having\nthe required properties. This proves the Fact.\nFrom this Fact and 6) we deduce that the category\nisog \u2212 p \u2212 F C := p \u2212 F C \u2297Zp Qp\nof isogeny classes of p-divisible objects of F C is an abelian, Qp -linear category.\n2.2.1.2. A result of Wintenberger. We recall a simplified form of the main result\nof [Wi]. If (M, (F i (M ))i\u2208Z , \u03c6, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ) is a p-divisible object with tensors of MF (W (k)),\nthen (cf. loc. cit. and the convention of 2.1 pertaining to it) there is a cocharacter\n\u03bc : Gm \u2192 GL(M ) such that:\n\u2013 the image of \u03bc fixes t\u03b1 , \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 J ;\n\u2013 it produces a direct sum decomposition M = \u2295i\u2208Z F\u0303 i , with \u03b2 \u2208 Gm (W (k)) acting\nthrough it on F\u0303 i as the multiplication with \u03b2 \u2212i , and with F\u0303 i as a direct supplement of\nF i+1 (M ) in F i (M ).\n2.2.1.3. Pull backs. We consider a W (k)-morphism m : X1 \u2192 X, where each X\nor X1 is either a regular, formally smooth W (k)-scheme or is a regular, formally smooth,\np-adic formal scheme over W (k); warning: if X is a formal scheme, then X1 is also\n(automatically) a formal scheme.\n\u2207\nLet a \u2208 Z. For any object (resp. p-divisible object) C of MF[a,a+p\u22121]\n(X), we can\n\u2217\ndefine its pull back m (C) (to X1 or through m). The construction of the object (resp.\np-divisible object) m\u2217 (C) of MF \u2207 (X1 ) can be obtained by entirely following the pattern\nof [Fa1, p. 34-35] (for the case of p-divisible objects it is somehow more convenient to\nfollow the pattern of the top of [Fa2, p. 135] referring to M\u0303 ).\nTo be shorter, we briefly recall the construction of m\u2217 (C) under the extra assumption\n(automatically satisfied if m is a formally closed embedding or is formally smooth, or if\nit factors as a composite of such morphisms), that locally in the Zariski topology of Xk\nand X1 k , we can choose Frobenius lifts of the p-adic completions of X and X1 which\nare compatible with m (these are the situations we need in what follows). So, due to\n[Fa1, 2.3], we can assume that X = Spec(R) and X1 = Spec(R1 ) are affine schemes,\np-adically complete and endowed with Frobenius lifts \u03a6R and respectively \u03a6R1 which are\ncompatible with the natural W (k)-homomorphism (still denoted by m) m : R \u2192 R1 .\nWe also assume C is a p-divisible object (M, (F i (M ))i\u2208S(a,a+p\u22121) , \u03c6, \u2207): the case of an\nobject is entirely the same. We now take\nm\u2217 (C) := (M \u2297R R1 , (F i (M ) \u2297R R1 )i\u2208S(a,a+p\u22121) , \u03c6 \u2297 1, \u22071 ),\n70\n\n\fwhere \u22071 is the connection on M \u2297R R1 naturally induced by \u2207.\nIn case X and X1 are equipped with Frobenius lifts compatible with m, then we can\ndefine in the same manner the pull back m\u2217 (C) (to X1 or through m) of any object or\np-divisible of MF (X) or of MF \u2207 (X).\nIn case X = Spec(R) and X1 = Spec(R1 ) are affine W (k)-schemes, we also refer to\nsuch an object or p-divisible object m\u2217 (C) as the extension of C to R1 or to X1 (through\nm) or as the extension of C through m. We also say: m\u2217 (C) is induced from C via the\nW (k)-homomorphism m : R \u2192 R1 .\n2.2.1.4. An application. Let O be a DVR of mixed characteristic (0, p) having\nindex of ramification 1. Referring to the end of 2.1, we have:\nProposition. Any regular, formally smooth O-scheme is healthy and p-healthy.\nProof: The case p \u2265 3 is well known, see [Va2, 3.2.2 1) and 3.2.17]: loc. cit. proves\neven more for such primes; but the new proof below, under above restrictions on O, works\nfor all primes. Following the Steps of [Va2, 3.2.17], only Step B of loc. cit. needs to be\nredone differently. We just need to show that any p-divisible group D over U extends to\na p-divisible group over Y := Spec(W (k\u0304)[[T ]]), where U is the only open subscheme of\nY different from Y and such that (Y, U ) is an extensible pair (see def. [Va2, 3.2.1 1)]).\nLet O be the local ring of Y which is a DVR faithfully flat over W (k\u0304). Let O1 be a\ncomplete DVR which has an algebraically closed residue field and index of ramification\n1 and which is a faithfully flat O-algebra. From [FC, 6.2, p. 181] we get that for any\nn \u2208 N, D[pn ] extends uniquely to a finite, flat group scheme Gn over Y . We just need to\nshow that for any n, m \u2208 N the sequence\n(SEQ)\n\n0 \u2192 Gn \u2192 Gn+m \u2192 Gm \u2192 0\n\nnaturally defined by the standard short exact sequence\n0 \u2192 D[pn ] \u2192 D[pn+m ] \u2192 D[pm ] \u2192 0,\nis in fact a short exact sequence. Let\n(DSEQ)\n\n0 \u2192 D(Gm ) \u2192 D(Gn+m ) \u2192 D(Gn ) \u2192 0\n\n\u2207\nbe the complex of MF[0,1]\n(Y ) induced by (SEQ) via 2.2.1.0. Let Mm , Mm+n and Mn be\nthe underlying W (k\u0304)[[T ]]-modules of D(Gm ), D(Gn+m ) and respectively of D(Gn ). From\nthe proof of 2.2.1.1 6) we get: they have the DC property. We claim that the complex\n\n(M OD)\n\n0 \u2192 Mm \u2192 Mn+m \u2192 Mn \u2192 0\n\nof W (k\u0304)[[T ]]-modules defining (DSEQ) is a short exact sequence. To prove this, due to\n[Fa1, 2.1], it is enough to check that the sequence (MODT) obtained from (MOD) by\ninverting T is a short exact sequence. But (MODT) over O1 is nothing else but the short\n71\n\n\fexact sequence defined by pulling back (SEQ) to O1 and applying D (for instance, cf.\nthe classical Dieudonn\u00e9 theory over the residue field of O1 ). Another way to see this is\nto use the arguments of 2.2.1.0 on the independence of D(G) on the embedding of G in\nan abelian scheme; over O1 we can use as well embeddings into p-divisible groups over\nO1 (cf. also [BM, p. 190-1]).\nWe conclude (DSEQ) is a short exact sequence. Using the DC property and simple\narguments involving lengths of artinian W (k\u0304)-modules, we get that (DSEQ) mod T is as\nwell a short exact sequence. So from the classical Dieudonn\u00e9 theory we get that:\n\u2013 if p > 2, (SEQ) mod T is a short exact sequence;\n\u2013 if p = 2, (SEQ) mod (2, T ) is a sort exact sequence.\nRegardless of the parity of p, using Nakayama's lemma we get that Gn is a closed\nsubgroup of Gn+m . This implies: Gm = Gn+m /Gn . So (SEQ) is a short exact sequence.\nThis ends the proof.\n2.2.1.4.1. Corollary. Let (Y, U ) be an extensible pair, with Y a regular, formally\nsmooth O-scheme of dimension two. Then any short exact sequence of finite, flat, commutative group schemes of p-power order over U extends to a short exact sequence of\nfinite, flat group schemes over Y .\nProof: We can assume Y is as in the proof of 2.2.1.4 and so the Corollary follows\nfrom this proof.\n2.2.1.4.2. Corollary. Any regular, formally smooth Z-scheme is healthy.\nThe case p = 2 of 2.1.4.1-2 answers a question of P. Deligne.\n2.2.1.4.3. Remark. One might wonder if in the proof of 2.2.1.4, the condition O\nis of index of ramification 1 is needed or not. A great part of the proof of 2.2.1.4 can\nbe adapted (even for p = 2) for an arbitrary index of ramification: however, (presently)\nthere is one obstacle. We sketch what this \"obstacle\" is (see \u00a76 for precise definitions\nand more details). We assume k = k\u0304. If V is a finite, flat, totally ramified DVR\nextension of V0 := W (k), then following the pattern of [Fa2, \u00a73] we define a category\n\u2207\n] [0,1] (RV [[T ]]) of p-divisible objects, whose underlying modules are free RV [[T ]]p \u2212 MF\nmodules of finite ranks; here RV is a W (k)-algebra obtained from V in the same way\nas Re was constructed in [Va2, 5.2.1], starting from the choice of a uniformizer \u03c0V of\nV . Here the tilde on the top of MF refers to the fact that F 1 -filtrations of underlying\nRV [[T ]]-modules are not defined by direct summands. There is a logical passage from\n\u2207\n] [0,1] (RV [[T ]]) of objects) and a\np-divisible objects to objects (so we get the category MF\nsimilar functor D as in 2.2.1.0. So the \"obstacle\" shows up as a question:\n\u2207\n\ng\nQ. For which morphisms of MF\n[0,1] (RV [[T ]]) can [Fa1, 2.1] be adapted?\n\nOne approach towards answering this question is to try to associate to any mor\u2207\n] [0,1] (RV [[T ]]) \"a pull back\" of it (via the natural W (k)-epimorphisms\nphism of MF\n72\n\n\f\u2207\nRV [[T ]] \u0589 V [[T ]] \u0589 k[[T ]]) to a morphism between two objects of MF[0,1]\n(W (k)[[T ]])[p].\nSuch \"pull backs\" can be constructed in many cases: it is easy to see that any ob\u2207\n] [0,1] (RV [[T ]]) is obtained by extension of scalars from an object of\nject of p \u2212 MF\n\u2207\n\n] [0,1] (W (k)[[T1 , T ]]), where W (k)[[T1 ]] is the ring of formal power series \"defining\"\np \u2212 MF\nRV starting (see [Va2, 5.2.1]) from the W (k)-epimorphism W (k)[[T1 ]] \u0589 V , which takes\nT1 into the chosen uniformizer of V .\nThe same method could be be used in connection to other regular O-schemes whose\nspecial fibres are having some properties (like are irreducible, etc.). Within these lines,\nwe hope to achieve the classification of S-healthy schemes \"tentatively defined\" in [Va2,\ntop of p. 430].\nFrom 2.2.1.4, as in [Va2, 3.2.4], we get:\n2.2.1.5. Corollary. Any (local) integral canonical model N of a Shimura quadruple\n(G, X, H, v), with v dividing 2, has the SEP and so it is uniquely determined.\nThis result was known previously just for zero dimensional Shimura varieties (see\n[Va2, 3.2.8]). However, if Sh(G, X) is the elliptic modular curve, then it can be easily\nchecked that (G, X, H, v) has a uniquely determined smooth integral model having the\nSEP. If Sh(G, X) is a Siegel modular variety of genus at least 2, it was not known\npreviously that (G, X, H, v) has a uniquely determined smooth integral model having\neither the SEP or the EP.\n2.2.1.5.1. Corollary. In [Va2, 3.2.7 4)], the conditions (v, 2) = 1 and (p, 2) = 1\ncan be removed. In particular, referring to 2.2.1.5, we get that the group Aut(G, X, H)\nof automorphisms of (G, X, H) (see [Va2, 3.2.7 9)]) acts naturally on N . Moreover in\n[Va2, 3.2.12] the condition e < p \u2212 1 can be replaced by e \u2264 max{1, p \u2212 2}.\n2.2.1.5.2. Uniqueness of projective integral canonical models: a second\napproach. It is worth pointing out that there is a second approach (besides the one\nbased on 2.2.1.4) to the uniqueness of a projective (local) integral canonical model N of\na Shimura quadruple (G, X, H, v) of compact type, with v dividing an arbitrary prime p.\nTo present it, we work in a slightly more general context and as the arguments for the\nlocal context (over Ov ) are the same, we concentrate just on integral canonical models.\nLet N1 be another integral canonical model of (G, X, H, v) which is quasi-projective. Let\nH0 be a compact, open subgroup of G(Apf ) such that N1 (resp. N ) is a pro-\u00e9tale cover of\nthe O(v) -scheme N1 /H0 (resp. N /H0 ) of finite type. We can assume H0 is small enough\nso that the connected components of ShH0 \u00d7H (G, X) are of general type.\nTo show that N = N1 , it is enough to show that N /H0 = N1 /H0 . It is enough\nto show that N1 /H0 is projective over O(v) (cf. [MM, Theorem 2]). Using Nagata's\nembedding theorem (see [Vo]) we deduce that each connected component C0 of N1 /H0\nis embeddable as an open subscheme into an integral, proper O(v) -scheme C. We can\nassume CE(G,X) = C0E(G,X) . If N1 /H0 is not projective over O(v) , then C0 is not C. So\nlet mC : Spec(V ) \u2192 C be a morphism, with V a strictly henselian complete DVR of mixed\ncharacteristic (0, p), such that the special point of Spec(V ) maps into a point of C \\ C0 .\n73\n\n\fLet KV := V [ p1 ]. Let mV := Spec(KV ) \u2192 ShH0 \u00d7H (G, X) be the resulting morphism.\nIt extends to a morphism Spec(V ) \u2192 N /H0 (as N /H0 is proper over O(v) ). It lifts to\na morphism Spec(V ) \u2192 N . As N1 has the EP, the generic fibre of this last morphism\nextends to a morphism Spec(V ) \u2192 N1 . This contradicts the choice of mC . We conclude:\nN1 is canonically isomorphic to N .\n2.2.1.6. The non-filtered context. Occasionally we speak about non-filtered\nFontaine categories of p-divisible objects: p \u2212 M(\u2217), p \u2212 M[a,b] (\u2217), p \u2212 M\u2207 (\u2217) and\np \u2212 M\u2207\n[a,b] (\u2217), with \u2217 \u2208 {R, X}, where R and X are as in 2.2.1 c), as well as about\nobjects of them with tensors. Not to be long, as a variation, we detail the definition of\nan object with tensors of p \u2212 M\u2207\n[a,b] (R). A triple (M, \u03c6, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ) is called an object with\n\u2207\ntensors of p \u2212 M[a,b] (R), if locally in the Zariski topology of Spec(R), can be extended to\na quadruple (M, (F i(M ))i\u2208S(a,b) , \u03c6, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ) defining a p-divisible object with tensors of\n\u2207\nMF[a,b]\n(R). The morphisms in non-filtered Fontaine categories of p-divisible objects are\nthe logical ones (for instance, in the context without connections, they are morphisms\nbetween underlying sheaves respecting \u2013after inverting p\u2013 Frobenius endomorphisms).\nWarning: if a < 0 then \u03c6(M ) is not necessarily included in M .\nMoreover, we speak about pull backs of objects of p \u2212 M\u2207 (X) through points of Xk\nwith values in perfect fields: we can assume X is local and that a Frobenius lift of X \u2227\nis fixed; considering Teichm\u00fcller lifts of X \u2227 with values in the Witt rings of such fields,\nthe pull backs are defined as in 2.2.1.3 (by just ignoring filtrations).\nWe could define as well non-filtered Fontaine categories of objects: as we do not\nuse them at all in this paper, except if (a, b) = (0, 1) or if we are in the context of kschemes S for which we do not know that \u03a9S/k is free or of finite type, these excepted\ncontexts are detailed just at appropriate places (see b) of 2.2.4 B, 3.15.2 and 3.15.810 below). However, we always identify p \u2212 M\u2207\n[0,b] (X) with a full subcategory of the\ncategory of F -crystals on Xk ; so we speak about morphisms between truncations of\nobjects of p \u2212 M\u2207\n[0,b] (X): we view them as morphisms between F -crystals on Xk in\ncoherent sheaves.\n2.2.1.7. Complements. 1) We refer to the category N \u2212 pro \u2212 MF (R) of 2.2.1\nc). Each object C of MF (R) can be identified with the projective limit of C/pn C, n \u2208 N.\nSo we view MF (R) as a full subcategory of N \u2212 pro \u2212 MF (R). By an almost p-divisible\nobject of MF (R) we mean an object C of N \u2212 pro \u2212 MF (R) which is the extension\nof a p-divisible object C1 of MF (R) by an object C2 of MF (X); when both C1 and\nC2 are not the zero object of N \u2212 pro \u2212 MF (R), we speak about a non-trivial almost\np-divisible object C of MF (R). The usefulness of this notion springs from the fact that\noften the cokernel of a morphism of p\u2212MF (R) is an almost p-divisible object of MF (R).\nStarting from 2.2.1.1 6) and 7), it is easy to see that the full subcategory a \u2212 p \u2212 MF (R)\nof N \u2212 pro \u2212 MF (R) whose objects are almost p-divisible objects of MF (X) is abelian\nand Zp -linear. Its objects can be interpreted in a similar way to 2.2.1 c) (i.e. using finitely\ngenerated R\u2227 -modules which are direct sums of projective ones and of ones which locally\nin the Zariski topology have the DC property).\n74\n\n\fSimilarly we define a \u2212 p \u2212 F C for any Fontaine category F C of objects.\n2) We always identify MF (W (k)) with MF \u2207 (W (k)). An object of MF (R) or of\nMF \u2207 (R) is called trivial, if it is either the zero object or it is the extension of scalars\nof some object of MF (W (k)) of the form Wq (k)(m), q \u2208 N, m \u2208 Z. If m = 0 then we\nspeak about a totally trivial object. A short exact sequence 0 \u2192 O1 \u0592\u2192 O2 \u0589 O3 \u2192 0 in\nMF (R) or in MF \u2207 (R) is said to be of direct summand type, if the underlying R-module\nof O1 is a direct summand of the underlying R-module of O2 .\nAn object of MF (R) or of MF \u2207 (R) is called solvable (resp. topologically solvable)\nif it is obtained from trivial ones via a finite number of short exact sequences of direct\nsummand type (resp. via a finite number of short exact sequences). An object of MF (R)\nor of MF \u2207 (R) is called unipotent (resp. topologically unipotent) if it is obtained from\ntotally trivial ones via a finite number of short exact sequences of direct summand type\n(resp. via a finite number of short exact sequences). An object of MF (R) or of MF \u2207 (R)\nis called quasi-solvable (resp. quasi-unipotent), if locally in the N-pro-\u00e9tale topology of\nSpec(R) is solvable (resp. unipotent). Here, if Spec(Q) \u2192 Spec(R) is an \u00e9tale morphism\ndefined by a homomorphism m : R \u2192 Q, then we endow Q\u2227 with the unique Frobenius\nlift \u03a6Q such that \u03a6Q \u25e6 m\u2227 = m\u2227 \u25e6 \u03a6R and the pull back operations of objects of MF (R)\nor of MF \u2207 (R) are as in 2.2.1.3. Similarly, an object of MF (R) or of MF \u2207 (R) is\ncalled topologically quasi-solvable (resp. topologically quasi-unipotent), if locally in the\nN-pro-\u00e9tale topology of Spec(R) is topologically solvable (resp. topologically unipotent).\nSimilarly we define (topologically) (quasi-) solvable and (quasi-) unipotent objects\n(resp. p-divisible objects) for any Fontaine category F C (resp. p \u2212 F C) of objects (resp.\nof p-divisible objects). We get the full subcategories top \u2212 q \u2212 solv \u2212 F C, top \u2212 solv \u2212 F C,\ntop \u2212 q \u2212 unip \u2212 F C, top \u2212 unip \u2212 F C, q \u2212 solv \u2212 F C, solv \u2212 F C, q \u2212 unip \u2212 F C and\nrespectively unip\u2212F C of F C whose objects are topologically quasi-solvable, topologically\nsolvable, topologically quasi-unipotent, topologically unipotent, quasi-solvable, solvable,\nquasi-unipotent and respectively unipotent. Similarly, we get top \u2212 q \u2212 solv \u2212 p \u2212 F C,\ntop \u2212 solv \u2212 p \u2212 F C, top \u2212 q \u2212 unip \u2212 p \u2212 F C, top \u2212 unip \u2212 p \u2212 F C, q \u2212 solv \u2212 p \u2212 F C,\nsolv\u2212p\u2212F C, q\u2212unip\u2212p\u2212F C and unip\u2212p\u2212F C. Of course, 1) and 2) can be combined.\nMoreover, the same applies to F C[pn ] (n \u2208 N): we speak about top \u2212 q \u2212 solv \u2212 F C[pn ],\ntop\u2212solv\u2212F C[pn ], q\u2212solv\u2212F C[pn ], solv\u2212F C[pn ], etc.; here, for instance, solv\u2212F C[pn ]\nis the full subcategory of solv \u2212 F C formed by objects annihilated by pn . An object of\nF C[p] is solvable (resp. unipotent) iff it is topologically solvable (resp. topologically\nunipotent).\n3) We summarize different connections between most of the categories we have defined so far. Let F C be a Fontaine category of objects. Denoting a full subcategory by\na hook right arrow and a subcategory by the inclusion sign, we have\nF C[p] \u0592\u2192 F C[p2 ] \u0592\u2192 ... \u0592\u2192 F C[pn ] \u0592\u2192 ... \u0592\u2192 p \u2212 F C \u0592\u2192 a \u2212 p \u2212 F C \u0592\u2192 N \u2212 pro \u2212 F C\nunip \u2212 F C \u0592\u2192 solv \u2212 F C \u0592\u2192 q \u2212 solv \u2212 F C \u0592\u2192 top \u2212 q \u2212 solv \u2212 F C\nunip \u2212 F C \u0592\u2192 q \u2212 unip \u2212 F C \u0592\u2192 top \u2212 q \u2212 unip \u2212 F C \u0592\u2192 top \u2212 q \u2212 solv \u2212 F C,\n75\n\n\fand, with X as in 2.2.1 c), we have\nisog \u2212 p \u2212 MF (X) \u2283 p \u2212 MF (X) \u2282 p \u2212 M(X)\nisog \u2212 p \u2212 MF (X) \u2283 p \u2212 MF \u2207 (X) \u2282 p \u2212 M\u2207 (X).\n4) Let X (resp. R) be a flat scheme or algebra over W (k). We assume a Frobenius\nlift of X \u2227 (resp. of R\u2227 ) is chosen. As in 2.2.1 c) (resp. in 2.2.1.6) we define MF (X),\nMF \u2207 (X), p \u2212 MF (X), p \u2212 MF \u2207 (X), p \u2212 M(X), p \u2212 M\u2207 (X), etc. Warning: we do\nnot claim that all properties of the smooth context extend as well. For instance, we do\nnot know when MF (X) is abelian.\n5) Let Xk be a regular, formally smooth k-scheme. We consider the full subcategory\nU N IP (Xk ) (resp. T OP \u2212 U N IP (Xk )) of the category of crystals on Xk on coherent\nsheaves with the property that each object Ob of it has the following three properties:\ni) there is n \u2208 N (depending on Ob) such that all sheaves of modules we get by\nevaluating Ob at different thickenings of Xk -schemes are annihilated by pn ;\nii) if X\u0303 is an arbitrary regular, formally smooth W (k)-scheme lifting an open subscheme X\u0303k of Xk , the OX\u0303W (k) -sheaf F obtained by evaluating Ob at X\u0303Wn (k) (cf. also\nn\n\ni)), locally in the Zariski topology of X\u0303Wn (k) has the DC property;\niii) the pair (F , \u2207), with \u2207 the connection on F defined by Ob, is unipotent, i.e. is\nobtained via short exact sequences of direct summand type in the same sense as of 2)\n(resp. via short exact sequences) from pull backs of Wn (k)-modules of finite type (and\nendowed with trivial connections).\nWe refer to U N IP (Xk ) (resp. to T OP \u2212 U N IP (Xk )) as the category of unipotent\n(resp. of topologically unipotent) objects on Xk . As in 1), 2.2.1 c) and 2.2.1.1 7) we define\nthe following 5 categories p \u2212 U N IP (Xk ), isog \u2212 p \u2212 U N IP (Xk ), N \u2212 pro \u2212 U N IP (Xk ),\nU N IP (Xk )[pn ], a \u2212 p \u2212 U N IP (Xk ) (resp. p \u2212 T OP \u2212 U N IP (Xk ), isog \u2212 p \u2212 T OP \u2212\nU N IP (Xk ), N \u2212 pro \u2212 T OP \u2212 U N IP (Xk ), T OP \u2212 U N IP (Xk )[pn ], a \u2212 p \u2212 T OP \u2212\nU N IP (Xk )) as well as truncations mod pm , m \u2208 N, of their objects. U N IP (Xk ) is a\nfull subcategory of T OP \u2212 U N IP (Xk ) and the same remains true in the context of the\nmentioned 5 categories. To check ii) and iii) it is enough to deal with specific lifts of the\nmembers of an arbitrary open, affine cover of Xk .\n2.2.1.8. Samples for 2.2.1 a) and d). The isocrystal of an abelian variety over k\nis 1/2-symmetric. If k = k\u0304 then the filtered \u03c3-crystal of the canonical lift of an ordinary\nabelian variety over k is diagonalizable and a p-divisible object of MF[0,1](W (k)).\n2.2.2. Definitions. 1) Let a \u2208 Z. An a-Lie \u03c3-crystal (resp. a Lie isocrystal over\nk) is a pair (g, \u03c6), with g a Lie algebra over W (k) (resp. over B(k)), which as a W (k)module (resp. as a B(k)-vector space) is free of finite rank (resp. of finite dimension),\nand with \u03c6 a \u03c3-linear Lie automorphism of g \u2297W (k) B(k) such that \u03c6(pa g) \u2282 g (resp.\nwith \u03c6 a \u03c3-linear Lie automorphism of g). If a = 1 we drop it.\n76\n\n\f2) A Lie \u03c3-crystal is said to be ordinary or of ordinary type, if the slopes of the\nisocrystal (g \u2297W (k) B(k), \u03c6) are (warning!) precisely \u22121, 0 and 1, with the multiplicity\nof the slope 1 equal to the multiplicity of the slope \u22121.\n3) A filtered Lie \u03c3-crystal is a quadruple (g, \u03c6, F 0 (g), F 1 (g)) such that:\n\u2013 the pair (g, \u03c6) is a Lie \u03c3-crystal;\n\u2013 F 0 (g) and F 1 (g) are Lie subalgebras of g, which as W (k)-submodules are direct\nsummands of g;\n\u2013 F 1 (g) is abelian and [g, F 1 (g)] \u2282 F 0 (g);\n\u2013 the quadruple (g, F 0 (g), F 1 (g), \u03c6) is a p-divisible object of MF[\u22121,1] (W (k)), i.e.\n\u0001\n\u03c6 1p F 1 (g) + F 0 (g) + pg = g (we have g = F \u22121 (g) and F 2 (g) = {0}).\n\n4) Let R and \u03a6R : R\u2227 \u2192 R\u2227 be as in 2.2.1 c). By a Lie p-divisible object of\n\u2207\nMF[\u22121,1] (R) (resp. of MF[\u22121,1]\n(R)) we mean a p-divisible object L of MF[\u22121,1] (R)\n\u2207\n(resp. of MF[\u22121,1]\n(R)) together with a morphism\nmL := L \u2297R\u2227 L \u2192 L\n\u2207\nbetween p-divisible objects of MF[\u22122,2](R) (resp. of MF[\u22122,2]\n(R)) satisfying the usual\naxioms of a Lie algebra. In practice the Lie algebra structure of L is obvious (i.e. is\nin-built in the underlying R\u2227 -module g of L) and so we always omit mentioning mL ; so\n\u2207\nthe notations are as in 3) above. We also refer to a Lie p-divisible object of MF[\u22121,1]\n(R)\nas a filtered Lie F -crystal over R/pR (this matches to 3) above in the case R = W (k));\nwhen we do not want to mention its filtration we refer to it as a Lie F -crystal over R/pR.\nAll these apply to the context when we are dealing with an X as in 2.2.1 c) instead\nof R or when we are dealing with objects instead of p-divisible objects.\n\n2.2.3. Remarks. 1) The slopes of a Lie (resp. filtered Lie) \u03c3-crystal are rational\nnumbers of the interval [\u22121, \u221e) (resp. of the interval [\u22121, 1]). Most common:\n\u2013 for Lie \u03c3-crystals (g, \u03c6), g is the Lie algebra of a reductive group and so [g, g]\u2297W (k)\n\u0001\nB(k), \u03c6 is a 0-symmetric isocrystal (i.e. the multiplicity of a slope \u03b1 is the same as the\nmultiplicity of the slope \u2212\u03b1; this is a consequence of the fact that the Killing form on\n[g, g] \u2297W (k) B(k) is non-degenerate and \u2013as \u03c6 preserves the Lie bracket\u2013 fixed by \u03c6; see\nalso 3) below) whose slopes belong to the interval [-1,1];\n\u2013 for filtered Lie \u03c3-crystals (g, \u03c6, F 0 (g), F 1 (g)), g is the Lie algebra of a reductive\ngroup and F 0 (g) is a parabolic Lie subalgebra of g having F 1 (g) as its nilpotent radical.\nWe sometimes need to use Lie \u03c3-crystals (g, \u03c6), with g as a Lie subalgebra of the Lie\nalgebra of a reductive group over W (k).\n2) We introduce similarly\n\u0001 to 2.2.2 3) the notion of an [a, b]-filtered Lie \u03c3-crystal\na+1\nb\nL := g, \u03c6, F\n(g), . . . , F (g) , where a, b \u2208 Z, b \u2265 a, by requiring that it is a p-divisible\nobject of MF[a,b] (W (k)) and g has a natural Lie algebra structure such that the Lie\nbracket morphism g \u2297W (k) g \u2192 g defines a morphism L \u2297W (k) L \u2192 L between objects\n77\n\n\fof p \u2212 MF[2a,2b] (W (k)). So an [\u22121, 1]-filtered Lie \u03c3-crystal is the same as a filtered Lie\n\u03c3-crystal. Forgetting the Lie structure, the pair (g, \u03c6) becomes a latticed isocrystal (if\na\u2208\n/ N then it is a \u03c3-crystal). As in 2.2.3 4), we define (filtered) [a, b]-Lie F -crystals. We\nalways drop [\u22121, 1].\n3) We recall the following well known result:\nLemma. Any isocrystal (V, \u03c6V ) over k is a direct sum of isocrystals having only\none slope.\nProof (slightly sketched): Dieudonn\u00e9's classification (see [Di] or [Man]) of isocrystals over k\u0304 implies that this holds over k\u0304 and moreover V \u2297B(k) B(k\u0304) has a nice W (k\u0304)lattice L. The word \"nice\" is used here in the following sense: there is n such that\npn (\u03c6V \u2297 1)(L) \u2282 L and L is a direct sum of W (k\u0304)-lattices taken by pn (\u03c6V \u2297 1) into\nthemselves in such a way that the Hodge numbers of the restriction of pn (\u03c6V \u2297 1) to any\nmember of this direct sum, are all the same. But any such W (k\u0304)-lattice L is defined over\nthe strict henselization of W (k) and so over W (k1 ), with k1 a finite field extension of k.\nUsing (here is the sketched part) standard matrix computations over W (k1 ) (similar to\nthe ones defining the F 1 -filtrations of canonical lifts of ordinary p-divisible groups over\nk1 ) the statement of the Lemma is true over k1 . Using standard Galois descent, the\nLemma follows.\nSo if \u03b1 \u2208 R and if (N, \u03c6N ) is an isocrystal (resp. a latticed isocrystal) over k, then\nwe can speak about the B(k)-vector subspace (resp. W (k)-submodule which is a direct\nsummand) W\u03b1 (N, \u03c6N ) of N corresponding to slopes of (N, \u03c6N ) greater or equal to \u03b1:\nW\u03b1 (N, \u03c6N ) is maximal with the property that it is taken by \u03c6N (resp. by \u03c6N times\nsome positive, integral power of p) into itself and all slopes of (W\u03b1 (N ), \u03c6N ) are greater\nor equal to \u03b1. Similarly, we define W \u03b1 (N, \u03c6N ), by replacing \"greater\" by \"smaller\", and\nW (\u03b1)(N, \u03c6N ) by deleting \"greater or\". So\nW (\u03b1)(N, \u03c6N ) \u2283 W\u03b1 (N, \u03c6N ) \u2229 W \u03b1 (N, \u03c6N )\nand by inverting p we have an isomorphism.\nLet (g, \u03c6) be a Lie isocrystal over k. Then p\u22650 := W0 (g, \u03c6) is a Lie subalgebra of g.\nWe call the (Lie) isocrystal (p\u22650 , \u03c6) (resp. the Lie algebra p\u22650 ) the (Lie) subisocrystal\nof (g, \u03c6) (resp. the Lie subalgebra of g) corresponding to non-negative slopes of (g, \u03c6).\nSimilarly we define things for non-positive (or positive, or negative) slopes, or for the\nslope 0, or for slopes greater (resp. smaller) than some r \u2208 [0, \u221e) (resp. than some\nr \u2208 (\u2212\u221e, 0]). In particular, p\u22640 := W 0 (g, \u03c6) and p=0 := W (0)(g, \u03c6) are often used.\nSimilarly, we denote by p>0 (resp. by p<0 ) the Lie subalgebra of g corresponding to\npositive (resp. negative) slopes of (g, \u03c6). Warning: similarly we define and denote things\nfor a Lie \u03c3-crystal.\nClaim. If g is the Lie algebra of a semisimple group over B(k), then p\u22650 is a\nparabolic Lie subalgebra of g.\n78\n\n\fProof: As this well known Claim is used a lot in what follows, we include a proof\nof it. Let (cf. Lemma)\ng = \u2295\u03b1\u2208SL c\u03b1\nbe the slope decomposition of g achieved by \u03c6. So the isocrystal (c\u03b1 , \u03c6) has only one\nslope \u03b1, \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 SL. Let GB(k) be the adjoint group over B(k) having g as its Lie algebra.\nc\u03b1 is perpendicular on c\u03b2 w.r.t. the Killing form KIL on g, provided \u03b2 \u2208 SL is different\nfrom \u2212\u03b1 \u2208 SL. Denoting Cs = {0}, if s \u2208\n/ SL, this is a consequence of the following Lie\nbracket property\n(LBP )\n\n[c\u03b1 , c\u03b2 ] \u2282 c\u03b1+\u03b2 ,\n\n\u2200\u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 SL.\nAs the center of g is trivial, p=0 is the Lie subalgebra of g normalizing c\u03b1 , \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 SL.\nSo (see [Bo2, 7.1 and 7.4]) it is the Lie algebra of a connected subgroup P=0 of GB(k) .\nWe know that the restriction of KIL to p=0 is non-degenerate. From [Bou1, ch. 1, th.\n4] we get that P=0 is a reductive group.\nWe can assume k = k\u0304. So we can assume there is a maximal torus T of P=0 whose\nLie algebra is stable under \u03c6. The centralizer of T in GB(k) is a reductive group C(T ) (see\n[Bo2, 11.12]) whose Lie algebra is normalized by \u03c6. The restriction of KIL to this Lie\nalgebra is still non-degenerate and T = C(T ) \u2229P=0 ; so to check that T is a maximal torus\nof GB(k) we just need to check that C(T )der is trivial. It is enough to show: if C(T )der\nis non-trivial, then (Lie(C(T )der ), \u03c6) has slope 0 with positive multiplicity. Shifting our\nattention from C(T )der to GB(k) (in order to use previous notations), we need to show\nT is non-trivial. If T is trivial then P=0 is trivial and then, for \u03b1 \u2208 SL \u2229 (0, \u221e] and for\nthe greatest element \u03b2 \u2208 SL we get [c\u03b2 , c\u2212\u03b2 ] = {0}, [c\u03b2 , c\u03b1 ] = {0} and [c\u2212\u03b2 , c\u2212\u03b1 ] = {0};\nso (cf. Jacobi's identity) c\u03b2 and c\u2212\u03b2 are perpendicular w.r.t. KIL and so are included\nin the annihilator of KIL. Contradiction. So T is a maximal torus of GB(k) .\nLet \u03a6 be the set of roots of the action of TB(k) via inner conjugation on g\u2297B(k) B(k),\nand let \u03a6\u22650 be its subset corresponding to the action of TB(k) on p\u22650 . \u03a6\u22650 is stable under\naddition inside \u03a6 and moreover \u03a6 = \u2212\u03a6\u22650 \u222a \u03a6\u22650 . This last equality is a consequence\nof the fact that c\u03b1 is the dual of c\u2212\u03b1 w.r.t. KIL, \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 SL. It is easy to see that this\nimplies \u03a6\u22650 contains a base of \u03a6. So the Claim follows from [Bo2, 14.17-18] applied over\nB(k).\nComments. As p>0 is perpendicular on p\u22650 w.r.t. KIL and as p=0 is reductive,\nfrom [Bou1, Prop. 6 b) of p. 81] we get that p>0 is the nilpotent radical of p\u22650 and so it\nis included in a Borel Lie subalgebra of g \u2297B(k) B(k) containing Lie(T ) \u2297B(k) B(k). So, as\nT normalizes c\u03b1 , from [Bo2, p. 184] applied over B(k), we get that c\u03b1 is the Lie algebra\nof a unipotent subgroup of GB(k) , \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 SL. From [Bo2, 7.1] we get that all these hold\nfor any (perfect) k.\nWe have a duality of language: positive versus negative, non-negative versus nonpositive, etc. So the Claim implies as well that p\u22640 is the Lie algebra of a parabolic\n79\n\n\fsubgroup of GB(k) . However, often in problems pertaining to Lie \u03c3-crystals it is more\nconvenient to work with a specific choice (like with p\u22650 instead of p\u22640 , etc.); warning:\nthe choice depends on the problem.\nThe above Claim still makes sense over W (k) due to the following general simple\nFact:\nFact. Let D be an integral Dedekind scheme such that all its closed points are of\npositive characteristic. Let GD be a reductive group scheme over D. Then the Zariski\nclosure in GD of any parabolic (resp. Borel) subgroup of the generic fibre of GD , is a\nparabolic (resp. Borel) subgroup PD (resp. BD ) of GD . In particular, GD is a quasi-split\nreductive group iff its generic fibre is.\nProof: As the operation of taking the Zariski closure is compatible with flat morphisms, we can assume D is the spectrum of a complete DVR V having an algebraically\nclosed residue field. Let KV be the field of fractions of V . We can restrict just to the\npart involving PD . The special shape of D implies GD is split; we deduce the existence of\n1\na parabolic subgroup PD\nof GD whose generic fibre is GD (KV )-conjugate to the generic\nfibre of PD (cf. also [Bo2, 21.11] applied over KV ). Using Iwasawa's decomposition (see\n1\n[Ti2, 3.3.2]), we get that PD and PD\nare GD (D)-conjugate and so the Fact follows.\n4) One may ask: why Lie \u03c3-crystals? There are three reasons. First, this is the best\nway to keep track of the relative situation which involves tensors (independently of some\nfixed \"embedding\": see 2.2.8 for a sample; see also 4.9.8 below). Second, we have natural\n\u2207\nequivalences between different categories MF[a,b] (\u2217) and MF[a+c,b+c](\u2217) (or MF[a,b]\n(\u2217)\n\u2207\nand MF[a+c,b+c] (\u2217)), with a, b, c \u2208 Z, b \u2265 a. When we take End's of their objects (see\n2.2.4 B below), c goes automatically away; so we have a better way to express our results\n(as samples see 3.6.18.7.0, 3.6.18.8.1 b), 4.7.11 4), etc.) and moreover, we do not want\nto lose track of the extra Lie structure of such End's objects. Third, we can read very\neasily different versal conditions (involving deformations of \u2013to be defined in 2.2.8 4a)\u2013\ngeneralized Shimura p-divisible objects over k) by looking at attached Lie F -crystals.\nIn some sense, \u00a71-4 grew out of a systematic exploitation of Lie \u03c3-crystals. Accordingly, to always have a good way of keeping track (without always emphasizing\nthe extra Lie structures) of when we are dealing with filtered Lie \u03c3-crystals instead of\njust some p-divisible objects of MF[\u22121,1](W (k)), most of the time we use the ordering\n(g, \u03c6, F 0 (g), F 1 (g)) instead of the standard one (g, F 0 (g), F 1 (g), \u03c6); the same applies to\nthe situation when W (k) is replaced by some R or X as in 2.2.1 c).\n2.2.4. Operations with (p-divisible) objects. In this section we deal with\ndifferent \"tannakian\" considerations. We mostly concentrate on what we need; however,\nsome material which is not needed in the rest of this paper is as well included. In what\nfollows we use the tannakian language as of [De5, ch. 2] (see also [Mi4, p. 288-9]) except\nthat we allow the base scheme not to be necessarily the spectrum of a field. Till end of\n2.2.4.1 we have n \u2208 N.\nA. Duals. No Fontaine category F C of objects has identity object with respect to\ntensor products. However, F C[pn ], p\u2212F C and isog\u2212p\u2212F C do have such identity objects.\n80\n\n\fFor instance, referring to 2.2.1 c), R/pn R(0) is the identity element of MF (R)[pn]. So\nwe can define duals of objects of F C[pn ], of p \u2212 F C and of isog \u2212 p \u2212 F C. For instance,\nif C is an object of F C[pn ], then its dual\nC\u2217 := HomF C (C, R/pnR(0))\nis computed as follows. Let us assume F C = MF[a,b] (X) (the \u2207 context is the same).\nIf C = (M, (F i (M ))i\u2208S(a,b) , (\u03c6i )i\u2208S(a,b) ), then\nHomF C (C, R/pn R(0)) := (HomR (M, R/pnR), F i (HomR (M, R/pn R))i\u2208S \u2212 , (\u03c6\u0303i )i\u2208S \u2212 ),\nwith S \u2212 := S(\u2212b, \u2212a), with\nF i (HomR (M, R/pn R)) := Ker(HomR (M, R/pnR), HomR (F 1\u2212i (M ), R/pnR))\nand with \u03c6\u0303i defined by the formula\n\u03c6\u0303i (fi )(\u03c6j (xj )) := p\u2212i\u2212j fi (xj ),\nwhere i \u2208 S(\u2212b, \u2212a), j \u2208 S(a, b), xj \u2208 F j (M ) and fi \u2208 F i (HomR (M, R/pn R)). This\nlast equality makes sense as for i + j > 0 we have fi (xj ) = 0. It does not depend\non the choice of n such that C is an object of F C[pn ]: the natural monomorphism\nR/pn R(0) \u0592\u2192 R/pn+1 R(0) defined by the multiplication (inside the ring R/pn+1 R) with\np, achieves a natural isomorphism\nn+1\nHomF C (C, R/pnR(0))\u2192Hom\n \u0303\nR(0)).\nF C (C, R/p\n\nIf Xk has a finite number of connected components, then\nF C = \u222an\u2208N F C[pn ]\n(cf. [Fa1, 2.1] ii)). So, as the dual objects can be defined restricting to each connected\ncomponent of X \u2227 , we get that, in general, each object of F C has a uniquely determined\n(up to isomorphism) dual.\nSimilarly, referring to 2.2.1.7 5) we have:\nLemma. a) T OP \u2212 U N IP (Xk )[pn ] and U N IP (Xk )[pn ] are Z/pn Z-linear, abelian\ncategories endowed with tensors products and duals.\nb) We assume that any object of U N IP (Xk )[p] (resp. of T OP \u2212 U N IP (Xk )[p]) is\nthe cokernel of an isogeny between two objects of p \u2212 U N IP (Xk ) (resp. of p \u2212 T OP \u2212\nU N IP (Xk )). Then any object of U N IP (Xk ) (resp. of T OP \u2212 U N IP (Xk )) is the cokernel of an isogeny between two objects of p\u2212U N IP (Xk ) (resp. of p\u2212T OP \u2212U N IP (Xk )).\nProof: We can assume Xk is connected. a) is just a variant of [Fa1, p. 31-3]:\nonly the abelian part is not entirely trivial. As we have duals (this is as above), we\n81\n\n\fjust need to check that U N IP (Xk )[pn ] and T OP \u2212 U N IP (Xk )[pn ] have kernels and\nimages. We first consider the case of T OP \u2212 U N IP (Xk )[pn ]. Its object (OXk , d), where\nd is just the d-operator viewed as a connection on OXk , is simple (i.e. has no proper\nsubobjects) and moreover, each object of T OP \u2212 U N IP (Xk )[pn ] is obtained from it\nthrough a finite sequence of short exact sequences. Let m : U1 \u2192 U2 be a morphism of\nT OP \u2212 U N IP (Xk )[pn ]. Using induction on the length of the underlying W (k1 )-module\nof the pull back of U1 \u2295 U2 via a W (k)-morphism z1 : Spec(W (k1 )) \u2192 X, with k1\na perfect field containing k, based on the fact that OXk is the only simple object of\nT OP \u2212 U N IP (Xk )[pn ], we can assume U1 = U2 = (OXk , d). In this case m is either\nan isomorphism or it is the zero morphism. The passage from T OP \u2212 U N IP (Xk )[pn ]\nto U N IP (Xk )[pn ] is an immediate consequence of the following Sublemma, whose easy\nproof is left as an exercise.\nSublemma. Let O and \u03c0 be as in 2.2.1 e). Let RO be a flat O-algebra. Let\n0 \u2192 M1 \u0592\u2192 M \u0589 M2 \u2192 0 be a short exact sequence of direct summand type, with M ,\nM1 and M2 as RO -modules having the DC property. Let N be a RO -submodule of M\nsuch that N , N \u2229 M1 and N/N \u2229 M1 have the DC property. Then N \u2229 M1 is a direct\nsummand of N .\nFor b) we can restrict to the case U N IP (Xk ) (as the case of T OP \u2212 U N IP (Xk )\nis entirely the same). Let now U be an object of U N IP (Xk ). To check b) for it, we\nuse again induction on the length of the underlying W (k1 )-module of the pull back of U\nthrough z1 . If U = (OXk , d), then U is the truncation mod p of (OX , d). For the general\ncase, we use a short exact sequence\n0 \u2192 (OXk , d) \u0592\u2192 U \u0589 U1 \u2192 0.\nBy induction, we consider an epimorphism e1 : U 1 \u0589 U1 , with U 1 = (F1 , d1 ) an object of\np \u2212 U N IP (Xk ). Let e2 : U 2 \u2192 U and U 2 \u2192 U 1 be the morphisms of a \u2212 p \u2212 U N IX(Xk )\ndefining the fibre product of U \u2192 U1 and e1 . pU2 is an object of p \u2212 U N IP (Xk ) (this\ncan be checked easily by \"evaluating\" at X\u0303 \u2227 's as in 2.2.1.7 5)). Using the short exact\nsequence\n0 \u2192 pU2 \u0592\u2192 U2 \u0589 U2 /pU2 \u2192 0,\nand similar arguments involving pull backs, it is enough to show that U2 /pU2 is the\ncokernel of an isogeny between objects of p \u2212 U N IP (Xk ). But this is or hypothesis. This\nends the proof.\nRemark. We assume X is proper and geometrically connected. We can assume (cf.\nGrothendieck's algebraization theorem) that all objects of p \u2212 U N IP (Xk ) involve locally\nfree OX -sheaves and connections on them. The hypothesis of b) is satisfied if different\ncohomological conditions hold (one such condition could be: H 1 (X, F ) is a torsion free\nW (k)-module and the restriction map H 1 (X, F ) \u2192 H 1 (Xk , F /pF ) is surjective, for all\nlocally free OX -sheaves which are obtained via short exact sequences from OX ).\nB. Ends. Let R, \u03a6R : R\u2227 \u2192 R\u2227 , a and b be as in 2.2.1 c). Let C =\n(M, (F i (M ))i\u2208S(a,b), (\u03c6i )i\u2208S(a,b) ) be an object of MF[a,b] (R). We can assume Spec(R/pR)\n82\n\n\fhas a finite number of connected components; so we view M as an R-module (and not\njust as an R\u2227 -module). For j \u2208 SS(a, b), let\nF j (End(M )) := {m \u2208 End(M )|m(F i (M )) \u2282 F i+j (M ), \u2200i \u2208 S(a, b)}.\nAs F i (M )'s (as R-modules) are direct summands of M (see [Fa1, 2.1 i)]), F j (End(M ))'s\nare as well direct summands (as R-modules) of End(M ). The object of MF[a\u2212b,b\u2212a] (R)\nEnd(C) := (End(M ), (F j (End(M )))j\u2208SS(a,b), (\u03c6\u0303j )j\u2208SS(a,b) )\nis called the End object of C. \u03c6\u0303j 's are obtained from \u03c6i 's in the logical way: if m \u2208\nF i (End(M )) and x \u2208 F j (M ), then\n(EN DF R)\n\n\u03c6\u0303i (m)(\u03c6j (x)) := \u03c6i+j (m(x)).\n\nSo, if M is a projective R/pn R-module for some n \u2208 N, then \u03c6\u0303j 's are obtained via\nthe canonical identification End(M ) = M \u2297R/pn R M \u2217 . The natural Lie bracket map\nEnd(M ) \u2297R End(M ) \u2192 End(M ), defines a morphism\nEnd(C) \u2297R End(C) \u2192 End(C)\nbetween objects of MF[2a\u22122b,2b\u22122a] (R).\nSimilarly, we define End's of objects of F C or of p \u2212 F C, for an arbitrary Fontaine\ncategory F C of objects. In particular, if C is a p-divisible object of MF[0,1](W (k)) (i.e.\nif C is a filtered \u03c3-crystal), then any Lie p-divisible subobject of End(C) is a filtered Lie\n\u03c3-crystal.\nSimilarly one defines Hom objects (resp. p-divisible objects): they are direct summands of suitable End objects (resp. p-divisible objects). Moreover, we have a natural,\nfunctorial (bilinear) identification Hom(C, C1 ) = C\u2217 \u2297 C1 .\nIf X or X \u2227 is not equipped with a Frobenius lift, then for the definition of End's of\n\u2207\nobjects of MF[a,b]\n(X) we assume b \u2212 a \u2264 p \u2212 1 and we think of End(C) as the collection\nof End objects indexed by pairs (U, \u03a6U ), where U is an open subscheme of X having a\nnon-trivial special fibre and \u03a6U is a Frobenius lift of U \u2227 , the End object corresponding\nto such a pair being End(CU ), with CU as the pull back (restriction) of C to U . The\nnatural gluings (see [Fa1, p. 34-35]) between such restrictions result in natural gluings\nbetween End(CU )'s. See C and D below for a fancier presentation of such gluings.\nWarning: taking End's is not a functorial process.\nExercise. a) We assume Xk has a finite number of connected components. Then\nfor any 2 objects C1 and C2 of MF (X), the Zp -module Hom(C1 , C2 ) is finite.\nb) Let b \u2208 N \u222a {0}. We assume k = k\u0304. Let C1 = (M1 , \u03c61 ) and C2 = (M2 , \u03c62 )) be two\nobjects of p \u2212 M[0,b] (W (k)). Then the Zp -module of morphisms between C1 /pn C1 and\nC2 /pn C2 which lift to morphisms between C1 /pn+b C1 and C2 /pn+b C2 is finite and by pull\n83\n\n\fbacks via the canonical morphism Spec(W (k1 )) \u2192 Spec(W (k)), with k1 an algebraically\nclosed field containing k, it remains the same. Here morphisms are interpreted in terms\nof OX \u2227 -modules endowed with Frobenius endomorphisms.\nHints. For a), using Teichm\u00fcller lifts we can assume X = Spec(W (k)); using\ndevisage and the existence of Hom-objects the situation gets reduced to case when both\nC1 and C2 are annihilated by p. For b), as above we can speak about Hom(C1 , C2 ) =\n(Hom(M1 , M2 ), \u03c6) and about the maximal W (k)-submodule M0 of Hom(M1 , M2 ) taken\nby \u03c6 into Hom(M1 , M2 ); each morphism we are interested in can be interpretated defines\nuniquely an element of M0 /pn M0 fixed by \u03c6.\nC. Tensorial closures. The problem we face (see the last part of B) is: if X \u2227 is\n\u2207\nnot equipped with a Frobenius lift, then just MF[a,a+p\u22121]\n(X) is presently well defined;\nfrom a tannakian point of view this is slightly inconvenient (see E and F below; see the\nproof of J below for the use of the word slightly). So it is desirable to define in some way\n\u2207\nMF[a,a+p+i]\n(X), with i \u2208 N\u222a{0}. There are many ways to proceed: accordingly, as below\nwe deal with four such ways, the first (resp. the second, the third and the fourth) one will\nhave the upper index \u2207(tens) (resp. \u2207(loc \u2212 tens), \u2207(p + tens) and \u2207(p + loc \u2212 tens))\ninstead of \u2207. The constructions have to be performed for each connected component of\nX \u2227 ; so we assume Xk is connected (i.e. is integral). Let\nU(X)\nbe the set of pairs (U, \u03a6U ) as in B. As in what follows we work with two or more Frobenius\nlifts of the p-adic completion of some fixed open subscheme of X, to emphasize which\nFrobenius lift we use to define Fontaine categories involving connections, we denote by\n\u2207\nMF[a,b]\n(U, \u03a6U ) and by MF \u2207 (U, \u03a6U ) the Fontaine categories defined by (U, \u03a6U ) \u2208 U(X)\n\u2207\nand which previously were defined just by MF[a,b]\n(U ) and respectively by MF \u2207 (U ).\nThe pull back functor\n\u2207\nMF[a,a+p\u22121]\n(X) \u2192 MF \u2207 (U, \u03a6U ),\nis faithful; in general it is not fully and this motivates what follows. If \u03a61U is a second\nFrobenius lift of U \u2227 , then (see [Fa1, proof of 2.3]) we have a canonical isomorphism of\ncategories\n\u2207\n\u2207\n1\ni(U, a, \u03a6U , \u03a61U ) : MF[a,a+p\u22121]\n(U, \u03a6U )\u2192MF\n \u0303\n[a,a+p\u22121] (U, \u03a6U )\n\nand, if \u03a62U is a third Frobenius lift of U \u2227 , we have the following cocycle condition\ni(U, a, \u03a61U , \u03a62U ) \u25e6 i(U, a, \u03a6U , \u03a61U ) = i(U, a, \u03a6U , \u03a62U ).\nDefinition. If T C is a tensorial category which is small, then by the tensorial closure\nin T C of a subcategory SC of T C we mean the smallest tensorial subcategory (i.e. the\nintersection of all tensorial subcategories) of T C having SC as a subcategory.\n84\n\n\fLet\n\nMF \u2207(tens) (U, \u03a6U )\n\n\u2207\nbe the tensorial closure of the union of the categories MF[c,c+p\u22121]\n(U, \u03a6U ) taken inside MF \u2207 (U, \u03a6U ). We will not include here a big ado about tensorial closures of arbitrary abelian categories. We just point out that there is a standard way to check that\nMF \u2207(tens) (U, \u03a6U ) does not depend (up to canonical isomorphism) on the choice of \u03a6U .\nWe have:\n\nLemma. There is a uniquely determined isomorphism\n\u2207(tens)\ni(U, \u03a6U , \u03a61U ) : MF \u2207(tens)(U, \u03a6U )\u2192MF\n \u0303\n(U, \u03a61U )\n\nof tensorial categories which extends i(U, c, \u03a6U , \u03a61U ), \u2200c \u2208 Z.\nProof: We consider the product category\nT S := MF \u2207 (U, \u03a6U ) \u00d7 MF \u2207 (U, \u03a61U )\nand the smallest tensorial subcategory SC of it containing the union of the categories\n\u2207\nMF[c,c+p\u22121]\n(U, \u03a6U ), c \u2208 Z, embedded into T S via the natural inclusion\n\u2207\nicU,\u03a6U : MF[c,c+p\u22121]\n(U, \u03a6U ) \u0592\u2192 MF \u2207 (U, \u03a6U )\n\nand the composite of i(U, c, \u03a6U , \u03a61U ) with the similarly defined natural inclusion icU,\u03a61 .\nU\n\nWe consider the natural (projection) functors F : SC \u2192 MF \u2207(tens)(U, \u03a6U ) and\nF1 : SC \u2192 MF \u2207(tens) (U, \u03a61U ). From very definitions we get: they are surjective (on\nmorphisms). We also consider the functor F F : MF \u2207 (U, \u03a6U ) \u2192 MF (W (k1 )) (resp.\nF F1 : MF \u2207 (U, \u03a61U ) \u2192 MF (W (k1 ))) defined by pull back through a \u03a6U -Teichm\u00fcller lift\nof U \u2227 in a k1 -valued point of it, with k1 an arbitrary perfect field. The fact that F and\nF1 are injective (on morphisms), results from the following two Facts.\n\u2207\nF1. \u2200c \u2208 Z, the image of MF[c,c+p\u22121]\n(U, \u03a6U ) in MF (W (k1 )) \u00d7 MF (W (k1 )) defined naturally via F F and F F1 factors through MF (W (k1 )) diagonally embedded in\nMF (W (k1 )) \u00d7 MF (W (k1 )).\n\u2207\nF2. \u2200c \u2208 Z, the image of MF[c,c+p\u22121]\n(U, \u03a6U ) in COH(U ) \u00d7 COH(U ) defined\nnaturally via the functor that associates to an object Ob of T S the underlying OU sheaves of F F (Ob) and of F F1 (Ob) factors through COH(U ) diagonally embedded in\nCOH(U ).\n\nBoth these two Facts can be checked locally (so we can assume U is affine) and so\nare a consequence of [Fa1, proof of 2.3]. We get: F and F1 are isomorphisms of categories\nand so we can take\ni(U, \u03a6U , \u03a61U ) := F1 \u25e6 F \u22121 .\nThis ends the proof.\n85\n\n\fCorollary. We have the following cocycle condition\ni(U, \u03a61U , \u03a62U ) \u25e6 i(U, \u03a6U , \u03a61U ) = i(U, \u03a6U , \u03a62U ).\n\u2207(tens)\n\nWe define MF[a,a+p+i] (X) to be the category whose objects are obtained from the\n\u2207\nones of the categories MF[c,c+p\u22121]\n(X), c \u2208 Z, through the following 4 operations:\n\u2013 taking duals and tensor products as well as kernels and cokernels compatible with\nthe standard gluings and whose underlying OX \u2227 -sheaves are having filtrations in the\nrange [a, a + p + i];\nits maps (morphisms) are defined in the logical way. Similarly, by not specifying the\nrange of filtrations, we define MF \u2207(tens)(X).\nTo fully formalize the definition of MF \u2207(tens)(X), we recall (see [Fa1, p. 34-5]) that\nMF[c,c+p\u22121](X) is the subcategory of\nF(X) := \u00d7(U,\u03a6U )\u2208U(X) MF \u2207 (U, \u03a6U )\nwhose morphisms are families of morphisms (mU,\u03a6U )(U,\u03a6U )\u2208U(X) , with each mU,\u03a6U as a\n\u2207\nmorphism of MF[c,c+p\u22121]\n(U, \u03a6U ), such that for any functor i(U, c, \u03a6U , \u03a61U ) as above we\nhave\ni(U, c, \u03a6U , \u03a61U )(mU,\u03a6U ) = mU,\u03a61U .\nSo we define MF \u2207(tens) (X) as the tensorial closure of the union of MF[c,c+p\u22121](X)'s\n(c \u2208 Z) in F(X).\nRemarks. 1) Each morphism of MF \u2207(tens)(X) defines a family of morphisms\n(mU,\u03a6U )(U,\u03a6U )\u2208U(X) , with each mU,\u03a6U as a morphism of MF \u2207(tens)(U, \u03a6U ), such that\nfor any functor i(U, \u03a6U , \u03a61U ) as in the Lemma the following equality\n(GLU E)\n\ni(U, \u03a6U , \u03a61U )(mU,\u03a6U ) = mU,\u03a61U\n\nmakes sense and holds.\nWe denote by MF \u2207(loc\u2212tens) (X) the subcategory of F(X) formed by all such families\nof morphisms. We do not stop to study when the natural inclusion of categories\nMF \u2207(tens)(X) \u2282 MF \u2207(loc\u2212tens) (X)\nis an isomorphism.\n2) If X \u2227 has a Frobenius lift, then MF \u2207(loc\u2212tens) (X) is naturally a subcategory of\nMF \u2207 (X).\n3) We consider an open cover (Ui )i\u2208I of X. In the definition of MF \u2207(tens) (X) (or\nof MF \u2207(loc\u2212tens) (X)) we can restrict to the subset of U(X) whose elements are of the\nform (U, \u03a6U ), with U an affine, open subscheme of Ui , for some i \u2208 I.\n86\n\n\f4) As the category COH(X) is tensorial, following the pattern of F2 we get that for\neach object of MF \u2207(tens)(X) we can speak about its underlying OX -sheaf (it has the\nDC property) and about its filtration by direct summands. So the gluing performed by\n(GLUE) of 1) is just at the level of Frobenius endomorphisms.\nD. Two other variants. The problem with MF \u2207(tens)(X) is: the category p \u2212\nMF \u2207 (X) is already well defined (see 2.2.1.1 3)). But there is nothing to guarantee\nthat under the operation of taking truncations mod pn , n \u2208 N, we get a functor from\np \u2212 MF \u2207 (X) to MF \u2207(tens)(X). So as a second variant, we define MF \u2207(p+tens) (X) to\nbe the tensorial closure in F(X) of the union of MF \u2207(tens) (X) and of the images of the\ntruncation mod pm functors from p \u2212 MF \u2207 (X) to F(X), m \u2208 N. 4) of C still applies to\nit. Similarly, we define MF \u2207(p+loc\u2212tens) (X).\n\u2207(tens)\n\nExercise. a) We define MF[a,a+p\u22121] (X) to be the full subcategory of MF \u2207(tens)(X)\nwhose objections are involving filtrations in the range [a, a + p \u2212 1]. Show that we have\n\u2207(tens)\n\u2207\na canonical identification MF[a,a+p\u22121]\n(X) = MF[a,a+p\u22121] (X). The same holds, with\nMF \u2207(tens) (X) being replaced by MF \u2207(loc\u2212tens) (X).\nb) The category of p-divisible objects of MF \u2207(p+tens) (X) (defined following the\npattern of 2.2.1 c)) is naturally identified with p \u2212 MF \u2207 (X).\nc) Define p \u2212 MF \u2207(tens) (X). Show that it is a subcategory of p \u2212 MF \u2207 (X).\nd) Perform c) as well for N \u2212 pro \u2212 MF \u2207(tens) (X) and for isog \u2212 p \u2212 MF \u2207(tens) (X).\nHint: use the proof of the Lemma of C.\nE. Rigidity. All Fontaine categories involving filtrations (of sheaves) in a finite\nrange are not stable under tensor products and so are not rigid. However, if X is as\nin 2.2.1 c) and X \u2227 is equipped with a Frobenius lift (resp. is not equipped with a\nFrobenius lift) and if F C is any one of the following two (resp. four) categories MF (X)\nand MF \u2207 (X) (resp. MF \u2207(tens) , MF \u2207(loc\u2212tens) , MF \u2207(p+tens) and MF \u2207(p+loc\u2212tens) ),\nthen F C[pn ], p \u2212 F C and isog \u2212 p \u2212 F C are rigid.\nF. Fibre functors. Let O be DVR and let u \u2208 O be a uniformizer. Let T C be\na tensorial category over O/un O. [De5] and [Mi4] are stated over fields; however, the\ndefinition of a fibre functor as defined in [De5, 2.8] can be adapted for tensorial categories\nover (quotients of) O as follows.\nDefinitions. 1) Let X be a flat O/un O-scheme. A tensorial subcategory SC of\nCOH(OX ) over O/un O is said to be a good subcategory on X if it has the property that\neach object of it, locally in the Zariski topology of X has the DC property.\n2) By an almost fibre (resp. by a fibre) functor of T C we mean an O/pn O-linear\nfunctor which respects tensor products, identity elements and the standard constraints\nA, U, and C (see [De5, 2.7]) from T C to COH(X1 ) (resp. to LF (X1 )), with X1 an\nO/un O-scheme which is not necessarily flat, which is the composite of an O/pn O-linear,\nexact, tensorial functor\nT C \u2192 COH(X)\n87\n\n\ffactoring through a good subcategory on X (resp. T C \u2192 LF (X)), with X a flat O/un Oscheme, with the natural pull back functor m\u2217 : COH(X) \u2192 COH(X1 ) (resp. m\u2217 :\nLF (X) \u2192 LF (X1 )) defined by some O/un O-morphism m : X1 \u2192 X.\n3) T C is called tannakian if it has an almost fibre functor.\nFact. Any almost fibre functor of T C is exact.\nProof: Let SC be as in the Definition. We need to show that the restriction m\u2217 |SC\nto it of any pull back functor m\u2217 : COH(X) \u2192 COH(X1 ), with m : X1 \u2192 X an\nO/un O-morphism, is exact. We can assume X is connected. We consider a short exact\nsequence\n(SES)\n\n0 \u2192 O1 \u0592\u2192 O2 \u0589 O3 \u2192 0\n\nin SC. To show that the complex\n(COM )\n\n0 \u2192 m\u2217 (O1 ) \u2192 m\u2217 (O2 ) \u2192 m\u2217 (O3 ) \u2192 0\n\nis exact, we proceed by induction on q \u2208 S(1, n) such that uq annihilates O2 . It is enough\nto show that the complex 0 \u2192 m\u2217 (O1 ) \u2192 m\u2217 (O2 ) is exact. If q = 1 then (SES) locally\nin the Zariski topology of X (or of Xk ) splits and so (COM ) is exact. The passage from\nq \u2212 1 to q is argued as follows. We use a second induction on the rank rk(O2 ) of the\nlocally free OXO/uO -module\nq\nX\nui\u22121 O2 /ui O2 .\ni=1\n\nWe can assume O3 is non-zero. We have a standard short exact sequence\n0 \u2192 uq\u22121 m\u2217 (O1 ) \u0592\u2192 m\u2217 (O1 ) \u0589 m\u2217 (O1 /uq\u22121 O1 ) \u2192 0.\n\u2032\nDenoting by O12 the image of O1 in O2 /uq\u22121 O2 and by O12\nthe kernel of O1 \u2192 O12 , we\nget a short exact sequence\n\n(SES1)\n\n\u2032\n0 \u2192 O12\n\u0592\u2192 O1 \u0589 O12 \u2192 0.\n\nAs O3 is non-zero, we have rk(O1 ) < rk(O2 ). So by the induction statements, the pull\n\u2032\nback through m\u2217 of (SES1) and of the exact complexes 0 \u2192 O12\n\u0592\u2192 uq\u22121 O2 and 0 \u0592\u2192\nO12 \u2192 O1 /un\u22121 O1 , are exact. These imply that the complex 0 \u2192 m\u2217 (O1 ) \u0592\u2192 m\u2217 (O2 ) is\nexact. This ends the proof.\nFor the language of groupoids we refer to [De5, p. 113-5 and \u00a73] and [Mi4, Appendix\nA]; again we allow the base to be an arbitrary Z-algebra RZ . For simplicity, as we deal\nwith very explicit groupoids, a groupoid acting on an RZ -scheme X is usually denoted\njust as an RZ -scheme. The definition of a representation of a O/un O-groupoid acting on\nan O-scheme X is as in [De5, 3.3] (so an arbitrary quasi-coherent OX -sheaf V is allowed\nto be the target \u2013see [De5, p. 114]\u2013 of such a representation).\n88\n\n\fLet X and F C be as in E. In all that follows, for simplicity of presentation, we\nassume Xk is connected. As the only global sections of OXk fixed by the Frobenius\nendomorphism of Xk are the ones defined by elements of Fp , we have\nEndF C (XWn (k) (0)) = Z/pn Z;\nhere XWn (k) (0) is the pull back of Wn (k)(0) to X. Accordingly, we view as well XWn (k)\nas a Z/pn Z-scheme.\nFact. F C[pn ] and all its rigid full subcategories (like q\u2212unip\u2212F C[pn ], solv\u2212F C[pn ],\netc.) are tannakian categories over Z/pn Z.\nTo see this we just need to point out (cf. the Fact) that there is a canonical almost\nfibre functor\nCAF Fn (F C) : F C[pn ] \u2192 COH(XWn (k) );\nit associates to any object of F C[pn ] its underlying OXWn (k) -sheaf (the action on morphism being the logical one). We have the following compatibility property: identifying COH(XWn (k) ) with a full subcategory of COH(XWn+1 (k) ), the restriction of\nCAF Fn+1 (F C) to F C[pn ] is CAF Fn (F C).\nSimilarly, if X is affine (resp. is proper over W (k)), then isog \u2212p\u2212F C is a tannakian\ncategory over Qp : the canonical fibre functor\nCAF F\u221e (F C)\nof it takes values in LF (X \u2227 \u2297Zp Qp ) (resp. takes values, cf. Grothendieck's algebraization\ntheorem, in LF (XB(k) )).\nG. Pull backs. All pull back operations of 2.2.1.3 are functorial, Zp -linear, respect\ntensor products and (when appropriate) identity objects. Moreover, they do extend to\nthe context of MF \u2207(tens)(X) and of MF \u2207(p+tens) (X) (for instance, cf. 3) and 4) of C).\nH. Fontaine's comparison theory. We assume that p > 2 and that X is\nan integral, regular, formally smooth W (k)-scheme having a connected special fibre.\nWe also assume that we can speak about Fontaine's comparison theory for objects of\n\u2207\nMF[c,c+p\u22122]\n(U ), for any affine, open subscheme U of X which is faithfully flat over\nW (k) and formally \u00e9tale over W (k)[x1 , ..., xm][ Q 1 x ], with m equal to the relative\ni\u2208S(1,m)\n\ni\n\ndimension of X over W (k) ([Fa1, 2.6] says that X smooth over W (k) would do; this\ncan be easily extended to pro-\u00e9tale covers of smooth W (k)-schemes). By this we mean\n\u2207\nthat there is a natural fully faithful, contravariant functor DU from MF[c,c+p\u22122]\n(U ) to\nthe category of representations of \u0393U on Zp -modules of finite length which respects the\ntype as defined in [Fa1, p. 37]; here \u0393U is a suitable (like in [Fa1, p. 38-40]) quotient\nof the fundamental group \u03c01 ((U \u2227 )B(k) , \u03b7U ), with \u03b7U as the generic point of U \u2227 . We\ndeduce the existence of a fully faithful, contravariant functor (still denoted by) DU from\n\u2207\np \u2212 MF[c,c+p\u22122]\n(U ) to the category of representations of \u0393U on free Zp -modules of finite\n89\n\n\frank. Let \u0393\u0303X be a suitable fundamental group obtained as in [Fa1, rm. of p. 41] such\nthat we can \"glue\" the above functors DU , to get a fully faithful, contravariant functor\n\u2207\nDX from p \u2212 MF[c,c+p\u22122]\n(X) to the category of representations of \u0393\u0303X on Zp -modules\nwhich are free of finite rank. For instance, if X is proper over W (k), then we can take\n(see [Fa1, 2,6*]) \u0393\u0303X = \u03c01 (XB(k) , \u03b7X ), with \u03b7X as the generic point of X.\nWe consider the subcategory F CT \u2212 isog \u2212 p \u2212 MF \u2207 (X) of isog \u2212 p \u2212 MF \u2207 (X)\nwhich is obtained through the four operations of C but performed starting from the\n\u2207\ncategories isog \u2212 p \u2212 MF[c,c+p\u22122]\n(X)'s, c \u2208 Z. As in C, we can define it in a fancier way\n\u2207\nas the tensorial closure of the union of the categories isog \u2212 p \u2212 MF[c,c+p\u22122]\n(X)'s, c \u2208 Z,\n\u2207\nin isog \u2212 p \u2212 MF (X). We have a natural fibre functor\nDX : F CT \u2212 isog \u2212 p \u2212 MF \u2207 (X) \u2192 Rep(\u0393\u0303X ; Qp )\ninto the category of Qp -linear representations of \u0393\u0303X : it is the tensorial extension of the\n\u2207\nrestriction of D to the union of the categories isog \u2212 p \u2212 MF[c,c+p\u22122]\n(X)'s, c \u2208 Z (so\nit is obtained via the above operations \u2013of taking kernels, cokernels, tensor products\nand duals\u2013 from Qp -representations of \u0393\u0303X obtained by making p-invertible in the Zp \u2207\nrepresentations of it associated (via DX ) to objects of p \u2212 MF[c,c+p\u22122]\n(X). Its existence\ncan be checked as in (the proof of) C, using tensorial closures.\n\u2207\nI. The quasi-solvable context. The category isog\u2212unip\u2212p\u2212MF[0,0]\n(X) is a full,\n\u2207\ntensorial subcategory of isog \u2212 q \u2212 unip \u2212 p \u2212 MF[0,0] (X), as well as this last category is\na full, tensorial subcategory of F CT \u2212 isog \u2212 p \u2212 MF \u2207 (X). So in H, we can speak about\n\u2207\n\u2207\nthe restriction of DX to isog \u2212unip\u2212p\u2212MF[0,0]\n(X) or to isog \u2212q\u2212unip\u2212p\u2212MF[0,0]\n(X)\nas being a fibre functor; we do not know if (or when) we can replace here unip by solv.\n\nIt is worth pointing out that:\n\u2207\nFact. isog \u2212 unip \u2212 p \u2212 MF[0,0]\n(X) can be naturally identified with the category of\nunipotent F -isocrystals on Xk .\n\nProof: We just need to show that any unipotent F -isocrystal C on Xk is obtained\n\u2207\nfrom an object of unip \u2212 p \u2212 MF[0,0]\n(X) by making p-invertible. Let n be the rank\nof C. Let C1 \u2282 C2 \u2282 ... \u2282 Cn = C be a filtration of it by F -subisocrystals such that\n\u2200i \u2208 S(1, n \u2212 1), Ci+1 /Ci is a trivial F -isocrystal of rank 1. Let Cint be an F -crystal on\n\u2207\nXk having C as its F -isocrystal. We view it as a p-divisible object of MF[0,0]\n(X) (this can\nbe checked using Teichm\u00fcller lifts: the slopes of any unipotent F -isocrystal over a perfect\nfield k1 are all zero and so any \u03c3k1 -crystal producing it can be viewed as a p-divisible\nobject of MF[0,0](W (k1 ))). But now, based on this and on Fact of 2.2.1.1 7), we get\ndirectly that the intersection of Cint with Ci taken inside C is a p-divisible subobject Cint\ni\nint\n\u2207\nof Cint and that the quotient Cint\ni /Ci\u22121 is a trivial object of p \u2212 MF[0,0] (X), \u2200i \u2208 S(1, n).\nThis ends the proof.\nJ. \u03c01 -groupoids. What follows is not used at all in \u00a72-4; however, we hope to\ncome back soon to its important (unexploited) ideas. We refer to E. We assume Xk is\n90\n\n\fconnected. We consider the Z/pn Z-groupoid\n\u03c01 (F C, n)\nacting on XWn (k) and defined (as in [De5, 1.11]) by automorphisms of the almost fibre\nfunctor CAF Fn (F C).\nThe case n = 1 is simpler as CAF F1 (F C) is in fact a fibre functor; so (cf. [De5,\n1.12]) \u03c01 (F C, 1) is faithfully flat over Xk \u00d7Fp Xk and the tannakian category F C[p]\nis isomorphic (in the tannakian sense) to the tannakian category of representations of\n\u03c01 (F C, 1). Unfortunately loc. cit. deals only with the case of a base scheme BS which\nis the spectrum of a field and with (see [De5, 2.8]) locally free sheaves of locally finite\nrank on some BS-scheme. So we do not stop to check here that similar properties hold\nfor n \u2265 2. As F C[pn\u22121 ] is a full subcategory of F C[pn ] as well as a quotient category of\nF C[pn ] (via the functor truncation mod pn\u22121 ), we have a canonical identification\n\u03c01 (F C, n)Wn\u22121 (k) = \u03c01 (F C, n \u2212 1),\n\u2200n \u2208 N, n \u2265 2. So it makes sense to speak about the projective limit of \u03c01 (F C, n), n \u2208 N;\nit is a Zp -groupoid\n\u03c01 (F C, n \u2192 \u221e)\non the p-adic formal scheme X \u2227 .\nSimilarly, in the isog \u2212 p context, we will not try to work with groupoids over\nanalytic spaces: whenever we refer to a Qp -context we assume X is either an affine or a\nproper W (k)-scheme. Let now X be affine (resp. proper W (k)-scheme). Starting from\nisog \u2212 p \u2212 F C, we similarly define\n\u03c01 (F C, \u221e)\nto be the Qp -groupoid acting on X \u2227 [ p1 ] (resp. on XB(k) ) defined by the fibre functor\nCAF F\u221e (F C). Loc. cit. implies \u03c01 (F C, \u221e) is faithfully flat over X \u2227 [ p1 ] \u00d7B(k) X \u2227 [ p1 ]\n(resp. over XB(k) \u00d7B(k) XB(k) ).\nWe expect that in many cases \u03c01 (F C, \u221e) is \"algebraizable\" in a natural sense. To\nexemplify here what we mean by natural sense, we restrict t the case X is affine. In such\na case \u03c01 (F C, n \u2192 \u221e) is algebraizable, i.e. it is obtained naturally from a Zp -groupoid\n\u03c01 (F C, alg) on X \u2227 . Warning: \u03c01 (F C, alg) is not necessarily flat over Zp .\nHowever, denoting by \u03c01 (F C, alg)Qp the natural pull back of \u03c01 (F C, alg) to a Qp groupoid on X \u2227 [ p1 ], we have a natural homomorphism\nmF C : \u03c01 (F C, alg)Qp \u2192 \u03c01 (F C, \u221e);\nit is defined by the natural \"inverting p\" functor a\u2212p\u2212F C \u2192 isog \u2212p\u2212F C which passes\nto isogeny classes. See 7) below for a study of it. Here we just point out that if X is a\n91\n\n\fproper W (k)-scheme, one should similarly be able to construct a natural algebraization\nof \u03c01 (F C, n \u2192 \u221e) and a natural homomorphism mF C . Warning: in this paragraph, in\ncase X \u2227 is not equipped with a Frobenius lift, we take F C = MF \u2207(p+tens) (X).\nWe have lots of variants and properties. 1) to 7) below are just samples of what one\ncan do.\n1) The unip and solv variants. Similarly we define \u03c01unip (F C, n), \u03c01unip (F C, \u221e),\n\u03c01solv (F C, n) and \u03c01solv (F C, \u221e), by working in the unip or solv context. For instance,\nif X is proper over W (k), \u03c01unip (F C, \u221e) is the groupoid acting on XB(k) defined by\nautomorphisms of the restriction of CAF F\u221e (F C) to isog \u2212 unip \u2212 p \u2212 F C.\nIn general, we have natural homomorphisms of groupoids on XWn (k)\n\u03c01 (F C, n) \u2192 \u03c01solv (F C, n) \u2192 \u03c01unip (F C, n)\nand in case X is an affine or a proper W (k)-scheme\n\u03c01 (F C, \u221e) \u2192 \u03c01solv (F C, \u221e) \u2192 \u03c01unip (F C, \u221e).\n2) Cocharacters. One of the nice features: whenever we consider a W (k1 )-valued\npoint of X, with k1 a perfect field containing k, [Wi] allows us to define cocharacters of the\nresulting pull back groupoids. For instance (see 2.2.14.1 below), we get a cocharacter of\nthe Z/pn Z-groupoid on Wn (k1 ) obtained by pulling back \u03c01 (F C, n) to a Z/pn Z-groupoid\non Wn (k1 ). Such pull backs are extremely useful in studying the flatness of different\nZ/pn Z-groupoids we defined.\n3) Fontaine's comparison theory variant. Let now X be as in H. Let\n\u03c01 (F CT (X)) (resp. \u03c01unip (F CT (X))) be the group scheme over Qp defined as the automorphism of the fibre functor DX of H (resp. of its restriction to isog \u2212 unip \u2212 p \u2212\nMF[0,0](X)). Similarly, let \u03c01 (\u0393\u0303X ) be the group scheme over Qp which is defined by\nautomorphisms of the tautological fibre functor of Rep(\u0393\u0303X ; Qp ). We get natural homomorphisms\n\u03c01 (\u0393\u0303X ) \u2192 \u03c01 (F CT (X)) \u2192 \u03c01unip (F CT (X)).\n4) Pull backs. If m : X1 \u2192 X is a morphism as in 2.2.1.3, then the above\nconstructions of groupoids are compatible with pull backs. Just one example. We take\nF C = MF \u2207(p+tens) (X) and F C1 = MF \u2207(p+tens) (X1 ). Then, corresponding to the pull\nback operation of 2.2.1.3 (see also G) we have a natural morphism\n\u03c01 (F C1 , n) \u2192 m\u2217 (\u03c01 (F C, n))\nof Z/pn Z-groupoids on X1Wn (k) .\n5) The extra feature of the case k = Fp . If k = Fp and if z \u2208 X(Zp ), then the pull\nback of \u03c01 (F C, n) via z, is a group scheme over Z/pn Z equipped naturally with a Z/pn Zvalued point defined naturally by the Frobenius automorphisms \u03c6Z of MF (Zp )[pn ]) (they\n92\n\n\fare obtained as in 2.2.1 c) starting from direct sum decompositions produced by canonical\nsplit cocharacters; see 2.2.14.1 below for the mod pn version of such cocharacters).\n6) Some extra features of the MF[0,0](\u2217) case. We just include two samples.\nThe Frobenius endomorphism of Xk gives birth, via the interpretation of Fact of I, to a\n\"Frobenius\" endomorphism of \u03c01unip (MF \u2207(p+tens) (X), \u221e).\nThe previous paragraph is just a property of the [0, 0] range. If F C is MF (X)\n(resp. any one of the Fontaine categories of E involving connections) let F C0 [pn ] :=\n\u2207\nMF[0,0](X)[pn ] (resp. let F C0 [pn ] := MF[0,0]\n(X)[pn]). F C0 [pn ] is a full tensorial subcategory of F C[pn ]. So the restriction of CAF Fn (F C) to it is an almost fibre functor: we\ndenote by \u03c010 (F C, n) the Z/pn Z-groupoid on XWn (k) it defines. It is naturally equipped\nwith a Frobenius lift. Moreover, we have a natural homomorphism of Z/pn Z-groupoids\n\u03c01 (F C, n) \u2192 \u03c010 (F C, n).\n7) The Zp -context. If X \u2227 is not equipped with a Frobenius lift, then below we\nwork with F C = MF \u2207(p+tens) (X). We have a variant \u03c01 (F C(ESS), n) of \u03c01 (F C, n),\nobtained by replacing F C[pn ] with the tensorial closure of the image F C(ESS)[pn ] of\np \u2212 F C in F C[pn ] via the truncation mod pn functor. Here (ESS) refers to: essentialized.\nWe have a similar natural identification (with n \u2265 2)\n\u03c01 (F C(ESS), n)Wn\u22121(k) = \u03c01 (F C(ESS), n \u2212 1)\nand a natural homomorphism (with n \u2265 1)\n\u03c01 (F C, n) \u2192 \u03c01 (F C(ESS), n)\ncompatible with restrictions (from mod pn to mod pn\u22121 , with n \u2265 2). So passing to limit,\nwe get a homomorphism of Zp -groupoids\nmF C,n\u2192\u221e : \u03c01 (F C, n \u2192 \u221e) \u2192 \u03c01 (F C(ESS), n \u2192 \u221e).\nIf X is affine, then \u03c01 (F C(ESS), n \u2192 \u221e) is as well algebraizable, i.e. is defined naturally\nby a Zp -groupoid \u03c01 (F C(ESS), alg) on X \u2227 . Moreover, mF C,n\u2192\u221e is defined naturally\nby a homomorphism\nmF C,alg : \u03c01 (F C, alg) \u2192 \u03c01 (F C(ESS), alg).\nIt seems to us that the pull back of it to a Qp -groupoid is an isomorphism. We have a\nnatural factorization of mF C through mF C,alg Qp : we denote it by mF C(ESS) . We have\nthe following philosophy:\nPh. \u03c01 (F C(ESS), alg) is the \"standard Zp \" part, while \u03c01 (F C, alg) \"captures\" the\n\"exotic p-torsion\" as well.\n93\n\n\fProposition. We assume X is proper and geometrically connected over W (k).\nThen there is a uniquely determined Zp -groupoid \u03c01 (F C(ESS), alg) on X having the\nproperties:\na) Its p-adic completion is canonically identified with \u03c01 (F C(ESS), n \u2192 \u221e).\nb) Its pull back to a Qp -groupoid on XB(k) is canonically identified with \u03c01 (F C, \u221e).\nc) For any affine, open subscheme U of X having a non-empty special fibre, the pull\nback to U := U \u2227 \u00d7W (k) B(k) of the identifications of a) and b) are compatible with the\ncanonical homomorphism mF C(ESS) U : \u03c01 (F C(ESS), n \u2192 \u221e)U \u2192 \u03c01 (F C, \u221e)U .\nProof: In essence, this is obvious: so we go quickly through the main details. We\nuse freely Grothendieck's algebraization theorem. We need the following obvious Fact.\nFact. Any finite subcategory of p \u2212 isog \u2212 F C is obtained from a finite category of\np \u2212 F C by making p-invertible.\nWe recall that we adopted (see 2.1) the point of view that F C is a small category.\nTo avoid using the notion of universes (which we do not mention any way), the reader if\ndesires, for what follows can work with a skeleton of p \u2212 F C. We consider the set S(F C)\nformed by finite subcategories of p \u2212 F C. We order it under the relation of inclusion: it\nis a filtered set. For each \u03b1 \u2208 S(F C), we consider the functor\nF\u03b1 : \u03b1 \u2192 LF (X)\nwhich associates to each object of \u03b1 the algebraization of its underlying OX \u2227 -module\nand which acts on morphisms in the logical way (via algebraizations). Let G\u03b1 be the\nZp -groupoid on X parameterizing automorphisms of F\u03b1 .\nIf \u03b11 , \u03b12 \u2208 S(F C) are such that \u03b11 \u2282 \u03b12 , then the restriction of F\u03b12 to \u03b11 is F\u03b11 .\nWe deduce that we have a natural homomorphism of Zp -groupoids\nf\u03b12 ,\u03b11 : G\u03b12 \u2192 G\u03b11 .\nWe take\n\u03c01 (F C(ESS), alg) := proj. lim.\u03b1\u2208S(F C) G\u03b1\nvia f\u03b12 ,\u03b11 's. The Fact implies that its fibre over Qp is \u03c01 (F C, \u221e). Similarly, the natural\nmorphism\n\u03c01 (F C(ESS), n) \u2192 \u03c01 (F C(ESS), alg)Wn(k) = proj. lim.\u03b1\u2208S(F C) G\u03b1Wn (k)\nis an isomorphism. The equality part is due to the fact that tensor products commute\nwith inductive limits. The fact that the arrow is an isomorphism is a consequence of\nthe fact that F C(ESS)[pn] is the tensorial closure of the image of T Rn (F C) (of 2.2.1.6\n7)): from the point of view of groupoids of automorphisms of almost fibre functors, the\noperation of taking the tensorial closure is irrelevant (cf. the exactitude of almost fibre\nfunctors and the list of 4 operations of C). This takes care of a) and b). c) can be checked\n94\n\n\flocally; it boils down to: if R is a flat Zp -algebra, then the only Zp -subalgebra R1 of R[ p1 ]\nsuch that R1 [ p1 ] = R[ p1 ] and R1\u2227 = R\u2227 , is R itself. This is a consequence of the fact that\nR = R[ p1 ] \u2229 R\u2227 , the intersection being taken inside R\u2227 [ p1 ]. This ends the proof.\nK. Some comparisons. We will be brief. Whatever was done above in the context\nof Fontaine categories can be redone in the de Rham context (of X). One defines different\ntannakian categories of vector bundles on XWn (k) (or on X or XB(k) , etc.) which are or\nare not endowed with some specific type of connections. So we get, as above, plenty of\n\u03c01dR groupoids. It is natural to try to \"compare\" them. The unipotent case is by far the\neasiest, cf. the following general Fact.\nFact. Let O and u be as in F. Let K := O[ u1 ]. Let X be a proper, flat O-scheme\nwhose ring of global sections is O. Then any pair (F , \u2207), with F a locally free OXK -sheaf\nof finite rank r and with \u2207 a connection on it, which is obtained from the pair (OXK , d)\n(with d as the connection annihilating 1) via short exact sequences, is obtained, up to\nisomorphism, from a similar pair (F (X), \u2207) on X by making u invertible.\nProof: We proceed by induction on r. The case r = 1 is trivial. We now consider a\nshort exact sequence\n(SES)\n\n0 \u2192 (F1 , \u22071 ) \u0592\u2192 (F , \u2207) \u0589 (OXK , d) \u2192 0,\n\nsuch that (F1 , \u22071 ) = (F1 (X), \u22071 )K , with (F1 (X), \u22071 ) a pair obtained from (OX , d) via\nshort exact sequences. M := Ext1 (OX , F1 (X)) is a finitely generated O-module. Let\n\u03b3 \u2208 M [ u1 ] be the class of (SES) viewed without connections. Considering the pull back\nof (SES) via the automorphism of (OXK , d) defined by um , with m \u2208 N and big enough,\nwe can assume that \u03b3 \u2208 M and that \u2207 takes the OX -sheaf F (X) (which is the extension\nof OX through F1 (X)) defined by \u03b3 into F (X) \u2297OX \u03a9X/O . This ends the proof.\nThe tannakian category isog \u2212 unip \u2212 p \u2212 MF (X) used here is different from the\none used in [Shi1-2]: loc. cit. uses unipotent isocrystals and not unipotent F -isocrystals,\ni.e (cf. the below Lemma) uses isog \u2212 p \u2212 U N IP (Xk ).\nLemma. Any object C of p \u2212 U N IP (Xk ) is a unipotent crystal, i.e is obtained from\nshort exact sequences of direct summand type from objects of p \u2212 U N IP (Xk ) which are\ncrystals on Xk in invertible sheaves.\nProof (slightly sketched): Let Dn be the maximal subobject of C/pn C which is\nobtained by pulling back a Wn (k)-module of finite type (and endowed with the trivial\nconnection); its existence is implied by the fact that U N IP (Xk )[pn ] is an abelian category\nhaving direct sums and of the fact that any quotient object of any such pull back is as\nwell a pull back of a Wn (k)-module of finite type. By very definitions, the OXWn (k) -sheaf\nof the evaluation of Dn at XWn (k) is non-trivial. We consider the maximal subobject\nEn of Dn with the property that the OXWn (k) -sheaf of its evaluation at XWn (k) is free.\nFor m \u2208 N, we have a natural monomorphism in,m : En+m [pn ] \u0592\u2192 En . Let Fn be the\nintersection of the images of all in,m , m \u2208 N. By reasons of ranks, we get a natural\nisomorphism jn,1 : Fn+1 [pn ] \u0592\u2192 Fn . The projective limit of jn,1 's define a subobject F of\n95\n\n\fC. It is easy to see that F is the pull back of a free W (k)-module of positive rank and\nthat C/F is an object of p \u2212 U N IP (Xk ). So the Lemma follows by induction on the rank\nof C.\nWe can perform B to J in the context of U N IP (Xk ). As in E (resp. in\nF) we get that U N IP (Xk )[pn ], p \u2212 U N IP (Xk ), isog \u2212 p \u2212 U N IP (Xk ) are rigid\n(resp. that U N IP (Xk )[pn ] is tannakian over Wn (k); its canonical almost fibre functor CAF Fn (U N IP (Xk )) is defined by evaluations at XWn (k) ). As in G we speak about\npull backs of objects of U N IP (Xk ), of p \u2212 U N IP (Xk ), etc., under morphisms X1 \u2192 X.\nb) of Fact of A holds as well for unip \u2212 MF \u2207 (X). So very often, for unipotent contexts\nwe do not need to make distinction between some \"essentialized\" or not (see 7) of J).\nHowever, to simplify the things below we work in \"essentialized\" contexts.\nFrom now on we assume X is proper. By replacing in the Proposition of J,\nF C(ESS) by unip \u2212 F C(ESS) and by U N IP (Xk )(ESS) we speak respectively about\n\u03c01unip (F C(ESS), alg) and about the unipotent, crystalline fundamental W (k)-groupoid\n\u03c01unip,crys (Xk , X) on X of Xk ; so\n\u03c01unip,crys (Xk , XWn (k) ) := \u03c01unip,crys (Xk , W (k))Wn (k)\nis the groupoid of automorphisms of the canonical almost fibre functor obtained by restricting CAF Fn (U N IP (Xk )) to U N IP (Xk )(ESS)[pn]. The combination of the Fact\nand of the Lemma implies that its fibre over B(k) is the same as the B(k)-groupoid\non XB(k) we get using vector bundles endowed with a flat connection and which are\nunipotent in the natural sense.\nWe have a natural forgetful functor (which forgets the Frobenius endomorphisms)\nunip \u2212 p \u2212 MF (X) \u2192 p \u2212 U N IP (Xk )\nand so, at the level of W (k)-groupoids we get a homomorphism\nmunip : \u03c01unip,crys (Xk , X) \u2192 \u03c01unip (MF \u2207(p+tens) (X)(ESS), alg)W (k).\nThere are situations when munip is an isomorphism; however, in general we have to look\nat \u03c01unip (MF \u2207(p+tens)(X), alg) as a quotient (often trivial) of \u03c01unip,crys (Xk , X).\nIf X \u2227 is not (resp. is) equipped with a Frobenius lift, then the fibre product\n\u03c01F (X)\nof munip with the natural homomorphism\n\u03c01 (MF \u2207(p+tens) (X)(ESS), alg)W (k) \u2192 \u03c01unip (MF \u2207(p+tens) (X)(ESS), alg)W (k)\n(resp. with \u03c01 (MF \u2207 (X)(ESS), alg)W (k) \u2192 \u03c01unip (MF \u2207(p+tens) (X)(ESS), alg)W (k)) is\ncalled Fontaine's crystalline fundamental W (k)-groupoid of X; it is on X.\n96\n\n\f2.2.4.1. Complements. 1) \u03c01unip,crys (Xk , X) is a W (k)-groupoid on X and so it\ndoes depend on X. On the other hand U N IP (Xk ) depends only on Xk . To reconcile\nthese two things, we can proceed in two ways. In the first way, we start with an arbitrary\nregular, formally smooth k-scheme Yk . We define the unipotent crystalline fundamental\ncrystal in W (k)-groupoids\n\u03c01 := \u03c01unip,crys (Yk )\nas follows. We work with CRIS(Yk /W (k)). If (Z, i, \u03b4) is an arbitrary object of it (i.e.\na thickening of some Yk -scheme Sk ; so i : Sk \u0592\u2192 Z is a closed embedding and \u03b4 is a\nPD-structure on the ideal sheaf defining i), to define \u03c01 (Z, i, \u03b4) we can assume that Z is\naffine, that pn = 0 in Z, and that there is a W (k)-morphism mZ,\u1ef8 from Z to an affine,\nregular, formally smooth lift \u1ef8 of an open subscheme \u1ef8k of Yk whose restriction to Sk is\nthe k-morphism Sk \u2192 Yk . Then we take\n\u03c01 (Z, i, \u03b4) := m\u2217Z,\u1ef8 (\u03c01unip,crys (\u1ef8k , \u1ef8Wn (k) )).\nAs the objects of U N IP (Yk ) are crystals in coherent sheaves, it is trivial to check that \u03c01\nis indeed a crystal in W (k)-groupoids. For this definition of \u03c01 , it is enough to have Xk\nsuch that locally in the Zariski topology, Xk has flat lifts to W (k) which, when viewed\nnaturally as thickenings of Xk , are final objects of CRIS(Xk /W (k)); in particular, the\n\u03c01 crystal in groupoids can be defined for arbitrary perfect k-schemes.\nFor the second way, we assume Yk is connected. Then the pull back of \u03c01 via any\ny \u2208 Yk (k1 ), with k1 a perfect field containing k, is a crystal on Spec(k1 ) in group schemes.\nSo it can be identified with an affine group scheme \u03c01 (y) = Spec(Ry ) over W (k1 ) (cf.\nalso the Proposition of J; we view Spec(W (k1 )) as a proper scheme over itself). We\nwill not stop to check if (or when) \u03c01 (y) does not depend on y \u2208 X(W (k1 )). It is well\nknown that the generic fibre \u03c01 (y)B(k1 ) does not depend on y. Argument: \u03c01 (y)B(k1 ) is\na pro-unipotent group scheme and so H 1 (\u0393k , \u03c01 (y)B(k1 ) (B(k))) = 0; on the other hand\n[De5, 1.12] and [Mi1, Cor. A.9] tell us that \u03c01 (y1 )B(k1 ) is an inner form of \u03c01 (y)B(k1 ) ,\n\u2200y1 \u2208 Yk (k1 ). However, this seems not to be enough to conclude that \u03c01 (y) does not\ndepend on y.\nDenoting, Iy := Ker(Ry \u2192 Ry \u2297W (k1 ) B(k1 ))), the group scheme naturally defined\nby Spec(Ry /Iy ) is referred as the flat part \u03c01flat (y) of \u03c01 (y). We do not stop to check\nwhen \u03c01flat (y) is of finite type (over W (k1 )). Even if its generic fibre is of finite type (over\nB(k1 )), we can not conclude from the proof of Proposition of J that it is of finite type;\nhowever, referring to the Fact of 2.2.4 K, we can always choose (F (X), \u2207) to be maximal\nin some sense and this is our guarantee that at least in many cases \u03c01flat (y) is of finite\ntype. However, \u03c01 is only one of the numerous possible variants: we can always restrict\nour attention to subcategories of p \u2212 U N IP (Xk ) of interest; for instance, referring to\n2.2.4 J, we can work as well with some G\u03b1 having the property that its generic fibre is\nthe group scheme (assumed to be of finite type) \u03c01 (y)B(k1 ) .\n2) We refer to 7) of 2.2.4 J. The study of mF C,alg is related to the study of objects\nof F C which have lifts. If 0 \u2192 O1 \u0592\u2192 O2 \u0589 O3 \u2192 0 is a short exact sequence in F C, b)\n97\n\n\fof 2.2.4 A points out that often O2 has a lift if O1 and O3 do have. In general, O1 has\na lift if O2 does. Using this one gets that often any morphism between objects of F C\nhaving a lift is the cokernel of a commutative (square) diagram in p \u2212 F C. Still this is\nnot enough to get that mF C,alg has a section. The problem is with pairs of morphisms\nof F C of the form\nO1 \u2192 O \u2190 O2\nwhere O1 and O2 have lifts while O does not. Usually we overcome this problem by\nconsidering only objects of F C which are self dual. Briefly, we denote by SD \u2212 F C the\ncategory:\n\u2013 whose objects are pairs (O, f ), with O an object of F C and with f : O\u2192O\n \u0303 t an\nisomorphism of F C;\n\u2013 whose morphisms are the logical ones (if (O1 , f1 ) is another object of (O, f ), then\nthe morphisms from (O, f ) to (O1 , f1 ) are given by morphisms h : O \u2192 O1 of F C such\nthat we have f1 \u25e6 h = ht \u25e6 f , with ht : O1 \u2192 O as the dual of h).\nIt is a tensorial, Zp -linear category. Similarly, we get SD \u2212 F C(ESS). mF C,alg has\nan analogue in the context of SD\u2212F C(ESS); it can be checked that it has a section. This\npoints out that we can speak about self dual (or orthogonal or symplectic) fundamental\ngroupoids (cf. also 2.2.23 below).\n3) All above can be redone over finite, ramified, DVR extensions of W (k) of index\nof ramification at most p \u2212 1 (cf. also 2.2.1.4.3). To us, based on the Fact of I and of\na logical ramified version of it, the comparisons in the unipotent F -context (of isog \u2212\nunip \u2212 p \u2212 MF (X)) or of F CT \u2212 isog \u2212 p \u2212 MF \u2207 (X) are all a consequence of Fontaine's\ncomparison theory of [Fa2, th. 5*]. So to us the interesting cases of comparisons are\nthe ones involving MF \u2207(p+tens)(X) or p \u2212 MF \u2207 (X) or an index of ramification which\nis greater than p \u2212 1. We hope to come back to them. We end by mentioning that the\nwhole of 2.2.4 can be adapted to the log-smooth context (see [Shi1-2] in connection to\nisog \u2212 p \u2212 U N IP (Xk )).\n4) Warning: in the almost p-divisible context (for instance, of a \u2212 p \u2212 F C), though\nwe have an identity object, we do not have duals; so, working with EDC instead of\nDC, we do not get useful extensions of 2.2.4 F. However, we can work with almost\np-divisible objects in order to construct directly different algebraizations of (W (k)-) Zp groupoids; for instance, we have a variant of the Proposition of 2.2.4 J in the context of\n\u03c01 (F C, n \u2192 \u221e): we just need to replace in its proof p \u2212 F C by a \u2212 p \u2212 F C.\n5) We refer to 2.2.4 C. We have a variant\nMF \u2207(big\u2212tens)(X)\n(resp. MF \u2207(big\u2212p+tens)(X)) of MF \u2207(tens)(X) (resp. of MF \u2207(p+tens)(X)) obtained by\nallowing besides the mentioned 4 operations (of 2.2.4 C) an extra one:\n\u2013 taking subobjects compatible with all gluings (see (GLUE) of C) of objects obtained\nnaturally by changes of Frobenius lifts of the p-adic completion of open, affine subschemes\nof X.\n98\n\n\fWarning: we do not know when we can define pull backs for these variants. However,\nsee 1.15.1 and 2.2.20.1 9) for their usage. The same apply in the context of \u2207(loc \u2212 tens).\n6) All of 2.2.4 can redone in the topologically (q-) solvable (or unipotent) context.\nThough it might look premature to say, it seems to us that such topological contexts\nare right contexts for making important steps towards the understanding of \"the whole\"\ncrystalline cohomology group of Xk 's as above (and not only of their unipotent counterparts).\n2.2.5. Definitions. Let X be a connected scheme.\n1) A Shimura group pair over X is a pair (G, [\u03bc]), with G a reductive group over\nX and with [\u03bc] a G(X \u2032 )-conjugacy class of cocharacters \u03bc : Gm \u2192 GX \u2032 defined over a\nconnected \u00e9tale cover X \u2032 of X, such that the induced (via inner conjugation) action of Gm\non Lie(GX \u2032 ) is defined (warning!) precisely by the characters: the null, the identical and\nthe inverse of the identical character of Gm . So \u03bc is automatically a closed embedding.\nIf moreover G is an adjoint group, then we speak about a Shimura adjoint group pair.\n2) Two such Shimura group pairs (G, [\u03bc1 ]) and (G, [\u03bc2 ]) over X (with \u03bci : Gm \u2192 GXi\ndefined over a connected \u00e9tale cover Xi of X, i = 1, 2) are said to be identical if there is a\nconnected \u00e9tale cover X \u2032 of X, dominating X1 and X2 and over which \u03bc1 and \u03bc2 define\nthe same G(X \u2032 )-conjugacy class of cocharacters of GX \u2032 .\n3) For any such Shimura group pair (G, [\u03bc]) over X, we denote by [Lie(\u03bc)] the\nG (X \u2032 )-conjugacy class of the (rank one) direct summand d\u03bc(Lie(Gm )) of Lie(GX \u2032 ).\nWe refer to the pair (Lie(G), [Lie(\u03bc)]) as the Shimura Lie pair (over X) attached to the\nShimura group pair (G, [\u03bc]).\nad\n\n4) Two such Shimura Lie pairs (Lie(G1 ), [Lie(\u03bc1 )]) and (Lie(G2 ), [Lie(\u03bc2 )]) over X\n(with \u03bci as a cocharacter of GXi , for Xi a connected \u00e9tale cover of X), are said to be\nisomorphic if:\na) there is an isomorphism of Lie algebras \u03c1 : Lie(G1 )\u2192Lie(G\n \u0303\n2 ), taking the kernel\nof the natural Lie homomorphism (between locally free OX -sheaves endowed with a Lie\nstructure) q1 : Lie(G1 ) \u2192 Lie(Gad\n1 ) onto the kernel of the similarly defined natural\nLie homomorphism q2 : Lie(G2 ) \u2192 Lie(Gad\n2 ), and such that the resulting isomorphism\nad\nIm(q1 )\u2192Im(q\n \u0303\n)\nis\nobtained\nnaturally\nfrom\nan isomorphism Lie(Gad\n \u0303\n2\n1 )\u2192Lie(G\n2 ) induced\nad\nad\n \u0303 2 ;\nby an isomorphism G1 \u2192G\nb) over a connected \u00e9tale cover X \u2032 of X, dominating X1 and X2 , \u03c1 takes [Lie(\u03bc1 X \u2032 )]\nonto [Lie(\u03bc2 X \u2032 )].\n2.2.6. Remarks. 1) Most common in 2.2.5 1), either:\na) G is split and X is local henselian, or\nb) X = Spec(Qp ) (resp. X = Spec(Zp )) and G (resp. GQp ) is unramified over Qp .\nIn case a) we can take X \u2032 = X. Argument: we consider a cocharacter of G which\nsep\nsep\nover the spectrum of the separable closure kX\nof the residue field kX of X is G(kX\n)sep\nconjugate to \u03bckX , and so we can assume X is strictly henselian. We just need to show\n99\n\n\fthat any two cocharacters \u03bc1 and \u03bc2 of G which over kX are identical, are in fact G(X)conjugate. Based on [SGA3, Vol. III, 6.1 of p. 32] (applied to the centralizers of the\nimages of \u03bc1 and \u03bc2 in G) and [SGA3, Vol. III, 1.5 of p. 329], we can assume \u03bc1 and \u03bc2\nfactor through the same torus of G. This implies \u03bc1 = \u03bc2 .\nFor future references we also point out that\n(DER)\n\nGad (X) = Tad (X)q(G(X)),\n\nwhere Tad is an arbitrary maximal torus of Gad and q : G \u0589 Gad is the natural epimorphism (this formula can be obtained by simply using two short exact sequences\n0 \u2192 Z(Gder ) \u0592\u2192 Gder \u0589 Gad \u2192 0 and 0 \u2192 Z(Gder ) \u0592\u2192 Tder \u0589 Tad \u2192 0, with Tder\nas the pull back of Tad to Gder , in the cohomological context of the \u00e9tale or flat topology\nof X).\nIn case b) there is a smallest unramified cover X \u2032 of X such that the Shimura group\npair involved is definable by a cocharacter \u03bc: Gm \u2192 GX \u2032 , cf. [Mi3, 4.6-7] (resp. cf. loc.\ncit., [Bo2, 15.14] and the fact \u2013it can be deduced from [Ti2]\u2013 that GX \u2032 has a maximal\nsplit torus whose generic fibre is as well a maximal split torus).\n2) We can work 2.2.5 in terms of the faithfully flat (or \u00e9tale) topology of X but for\nthis paper, the present form of 2.2.5 is all that we need.\n3) Based on 2.2.5 1) and 2), we speak about morphisms (maps) between two Shimura\ngroup pairs (G1 , [\u03bc1 ]) and (G2 , [\u03bc2 ]) over X: these are homomorphisms f : G1 \u2192 G2 such\nthat for a simply connected pro-\u00e9tale cover X \u2032 of X, [\u03bc1 X \u2032 \u25e6 fX \u2032 ] = [\u03bc2 X \u2032 ]. We denote\nsuch a morphism by\nf : (G1 , [\u03bc1 ]) \u2192 (G2 , [\u03bc2 ]).\nIt is called an injective map (resp. an isomorphism), if as a group homomorphism is a\nclosed embedding (resp. is an isomorphism). We get the category ShGp(X) of Shimura\ngroup pairs over X.\n4) A study of Shimura group pairs over\u0001 Zp together with their symplectic embeddings\n(i.e. injective maps into GSp(WZp , \u03c8), [\u03bc] ; here (WZp , \u03c8) is a symplectic space over Zp ,\nwhile [\u03bc] is uniquely determined by requiring that \u03bc : Gm \u2192 GSp(WZp , \u03c8) acts on WZp\nvia the null and the inverse of the identical character of Gm ), is implicitly started in 3.10\nand is fully developed in \u00a77. See 4.6.7-8 below for samples.\n5) Any Shimura variety Sh(G, X) of dimension \u2265 1 gives birth to a Shimura group\npair (G, [\u03bc]) over Spec(Q). Here \u03bc : Gm \u2192 GE 1 (G,X) is a cocharacter, with E 1 (G, X)\na finite field extension of E(G, X), which over C under an E(G, X)-monomorphism\nE 1 (G, X) \u0592\u2192 C, is G(C)-conjugate to anyone of the cocharacters \u03bcx , x \u2208 X, def. in\n[Va2, 2.2]. The association: (G, [\u03bc]) to Sh(G, X), is functorial.\n2.2.7. Remark. Let l \u2208 N. If X is local henselian and if G is an X-simple, adjoint,\nsplit group, then the Shimura group pairs (G, [\u03bc]) are implicitly classified by [De3, 1.3.9]\n(cf. also [Sa]); it is [SGA3, Vol. III, 6.1 of p. 32 and 1.5 of p.\n329]\n\u0002 l+1\n\u0003 which allows us to\ntreat the situation as if X is the spectrum of a field. We have 2 isomorphism classes\n100\n\n\fif G is of Al (l \u2265 1) Lie type, 2 isomorphism classes if G is of Dl Lie type (l \u2265 5), and\none such class if G is of D4 , E6 , E7 , Bl or Cl Lie type (l \u2265 1). There are no Shimura\ngroup pairs (G\u0303, [\u03bc\u0303]) with G\u0303 an X-simple, adjoint group of E8 , F4 or G2 Lie type.\nMoreover any Shimura group pair (G1 , [\u03bc1 ]) over such an X, with G1 an adjoint\ngroup, can be written uniquely (up to isomorphism) as a product of pairs (G2 , [\u03bc2 ])\nwhich are either having \u03bc2 as the trivial cocharacter or are Shimura group pairs having\nG2 as an X-simple, adjoint group. This is a consequence of the classification of adjoint\ngroups over a field (see [Ti1]).\n2.2.8. Basic definitions and notations. 1) A Shimura filtered \u03c3-crystal over k\nis a quadruple (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G), with (M, F 1 , \u03c6) a filtered \u03c3-crystal such that F 1 is a proper\ndirect summand of M and with G a quasi-split reductive subgroup of GL(M ), for which\nthe following condition is satisfied:\na) There is a family of tensors (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J of the F 0 -filtration of T (M [ p1 ]) defined by\n\u0001\nF 1 , such that \u03c6(t\u03b1 ) = t\u03b1 , \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 J , and GB(k) is the subgroup of GL M [ p1 ] fixing t\u03b1 ,\n\u2200\u03b1 \u2208 J .\nThe following two properties (introducing extra notations) are implied by this condition a):\n\u0001\n\u0001\u0001\nb) The quadruple Lie(G), \u03c6, F 0 Lie(G) , F 1 Lie(G) is a filtered Lie \u03c3-crystal;\nhere\n\u0001\n\u0001 \b\nF 0 Lie(G) := Lie(G) \u2229 F 0 End(M ) = x \u2208 Lie(G) x(F 1 ) \u2282 F 1\nand\n\n\u0001\n\u0001 \b\nF 1 Lie(G) := Lie(G) \u2229 F 1 End(M ) = x \u2208 Lie(G) x(F 1 ) = {0} and x(M ) \u2282 F 1 ;\nc) There is an injective cocharacter \u03bc : Gm \u0592\u2192 G producing a direct sum decomposition M = F 1 \u2295 F 0 , with \u03b2 \u2208 Gm (W (k)) acting through \u03bc on F i as the multiplication\nwith \u03b2 \u2212i , i = 0, 1.\nThe argument for why a) implies b) and c) goes as follows. c) is a consequence of\n2.2.1.2 and of the\nassumption that F 1 is a proper direct summand\nof M . From c) we get\n\u0001\n\u0001\ni\ni\nthat F Lie(G) \u2297W (k) k is the intersection of\n\u0001 F End(M ) \u2297W (k) k with Lie(G) \u2297W (k) k.\n1 1\n0\nSo \u03c6 pLie(G) + F (Lie(G)) + p F (Lie(G) is a direct summand of End(M ); as it is\nincluded in Lie(G)[ p1 ] (this is a consequence of a)), it is Lie(G) itself. c) implies F 0 (Lie(G))\nis a parabolic Lie subalgebra of Lie(G) having F 1 (Lie(G)) as its unipotent radical and\nwe have [Lie(G), F 1 (Lie(G))] \u2282 F 0 (Lie(G)); so b) follows.\n2) A Shimura \u03c3-crystal over k is a triple (M, \u03c6, G) which can be extended to a\nquadruple (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G) defining a Shimura filtered \u03c3-crystal over k. F 1 itself or this\nquadruple, is called a lift of (M, \u03c6, G).\n3) A generalized Shimura p-divisible object of MF[a,b] (W (k)) is a quadruple\n(M, (F i(M ))i\u2208S(a,b) , \u03c6, G),\n101\n\n\fwhere the triple (M, (F i (M ))i\u2208S(a,b), \u03c6) is a p-divisible object of MF[a,b] (W (k)) (so a, b \u2208\nZ, with a \u2264 b) and G is a quasi-split reductive subgroup of GL(M ), for which the following\nthree conditions hold:\na') The condition a) above holds under the modification that the F 0 -filtration of\nT (M ) is defined (see 2.1) by the filtration (F i (M ))i\u2208S(a,b) of M ;\n\u0001\n\u0001\nb') The condition b) holds but with F 0 Lie(G) and F 1 Lie(G) as direct summands\nof Lie(G) induced (see 2.1) from the tensor product filtration of T (M );\nc') The cocharacter \u03bc : Gm \u2192 G obtained by applying 2.2.1.2 to the quadruple\n(M, (F i (M ))i\u2208S(a,b), \u03c6, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ) (cf. a')) and producing a direct sum decomposition M =\n\u2295i\u2208S(a,b) F\u0303 i , with \u03b2 \u2208 Gm (W (k)) acting through \u03bc on F\u0303 i as the multiplication with \u03b2 \u2212i ,\ni = a, b, and with F i (M ) = \u2295j\u2208S(i,b) F\u0303 j , is such that at least two of the W (k)-submodules\nF\u0303 i , i = a, b, are non-zero, and so in particular it is injective.\n3a) If in 3) we do not impose b') and we just assume that G is reductive, then we\nspeak about a p-divisible object with a reductive structure of MF[a,b] (W (k)).\n4) A generalized Shimura p-divisible object over k is a triple (M, \u03c6, G) which can be\nextended to a quadruple (M, (F i (M ))i\u2208S(a,b) , \u03c6, G), called a lift of (M, \u03c6, G), defining a\ngeneralized Shimura p-divisible object of MF[a,b] (W (k)).\n4a) Similarly to 4), starting from 3a) we speak about a p-divisible object with a\nreductive structure over k (in the range [a, b]) and about its lifts.\n5) Let n \u2208 N. A Shimura \u03c3 n -isocrystal over k is a triple (MB(k) , \u03c6, GB(k) ), where\n(MB(k) , \u03c6) is a \u03c3 n -isocrystal over k and GB(k) is a reductive subgroup of GL(MB(k) ), for\nwhich there is a family of tensors (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J of T (MB(k) ) such that \u03c6(t\u03b1 ) = t\u03b1 , \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 J ,\nand GB(k) is the subgroup of GL(MB(k) ) fixing t\u03b1 , \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 J .\n6) A Shimura filtered \u03c3 n -isocrystal over k is a quadruple\n(MB(k) , (F i (MB(k) ))i\u2208Z , \u03c6, GB(k) ),\nwhere (MB(k) , \u03c6, GB(k) ) is a Shimura \u03c3 n -isocrystal over k and (F i (MB(k) ))i\u2208Z is a decreasing filtration of MB(k) , such that, with the notations of 5), we can moreover choose\nthe family of tensors (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J to be in the F 0 -filtration of T (MB(k) ) defined by the filtration (F i (MB(k) ))i\u2208Z of MB(k) . When n = 1 we drop it.\n7) By an endomorphism of a Shimura (resp. Shimura filtered) \u03c3-crystal (M, \u03c6, G)\n(resp. (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G)) we mean an element f \u2208 Lie(G) (resp. f \u2208 F 0 (Lie(G))) fixed by\n\u03c6. We denote it by f : (M, \u03c6, G) \u2192 (M, \u03c6, G) (resp. f : (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G) \u2192 (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G)).\nThe set of such endomorphisms has a natural structure of a Lie algebra over Zp . Similarly,\nwe define endomorphisms for 3) to 6).\n2.2.9. Remarks, facts and variants. 0) We often drop out mentioning \"over k\".\n\u0001\n1) We refer to 2.2.8 1). We saw that condition a) implies \u03c6 Lie(G)[ p1 ] = Lie(G)[ p1 ].\nIt is \"almost\" implied by b), cf. [Fa2, rm. iii) after th. 10]: in loc. cit. we do have\n102\n\n\fto consider Tate-twists as well; moreover, according to us, the first (warning: not the\nsecond) part of loc. cit. involving the existence of the line L0 is not correct as it stands\n(this is why we used condition a) to define Shimura filtered \u03c3-crystals).\nTo argue this, let C0 := (M0 , F01 , \u03c60 ) be a filtered \u03c3-crystal. Let \u03c10 : \u0393k \u2192\nGL(N0 )(Zp ) be the Galois representation defined by the dual of the Tate-module of\nany p-divisible group D0 over W (k) of whose associated filtered \u03c3-crystal is C0 . If p = 2\nwe assume D0 exists (it does exist after replacing k by an abelian extension of degree\ndividing a power of 2 which depends only on (M0 , F01 ), cf. the Corollary of the review\n2.3.18.1 D below). So N0 is a free Zp -module of the same rank as M0 . If p \u2265 3, then \u03c10\nis uniquely determined by C0 (for instance, cf. [Fa2, th. 7]). Let G0 be the flat, closed\nsubgroup of GL(N0 ) which is the algebraic envelope of \u03c10 (see [Se1]). Let G1 be an\narbitrary integral, closed subgroup of GL(N0 ) normalized by G0 . Let G\u03031 be the integral,\nclosed subgroup of GL(M0 ) corresponding to G1 via Fontaine's comparison theory (for\np = 2 it is recalled in 2.3.18.1 E below). We assume it is smooth and its Lie algebra is the\nunderlying module of a Lie p-divisible subobject of End(C0 ) (if p \u2265 5, the second part\nof this assumption is implied by the first one, cf. [Fa1, 2.6]). It is very easy to adjust\nthe situation such that G\u03031 has a connected special fibre as well. But if a line L0 exists\nas in [Fa2, rm. iii) after th. 10], then G0 is contained in a subgroup of GL(N0 ) which\nis the extension of Gm by G1 . This is not always so. So what is missing in loc. cit.?\nThe mistake consists in: the Zp -submodules of T (N0 ) of rank 1 and normalized by G1 ,\nare not fixed by G0 but just permuted (and the orbits under the resulting permutation\nare not necessarily finite). In other words, there are two ingredients missing in loc. cit.:\ncondition c) as well as the passage to an algebraic field extension of k (see the Fact below).\nWe come back to our situation of 2.2.8 1). As already pointed out c) results from\na). On the other hand, we have:\nFact. If k = k\u0304 and the conditions b) and c) hold, then a) holds automatically.\nProof: We just need to use a standard argument involving Zp -structures (it is\nrecalled in 8) below) and the fact that GB(k) is reductive: with the independent notations\nof 8), GQp is the subgroup of GL(M a [ p1 ]) fixing some tensors of T (M a )) (cf. [De4,\n3.1 c)]); viewing these tensors as tensors of T (M ) (via the natural identification M =\nM a \u2297Zp W (k)) we do get that a) holds automatically.\nSo no doubt, a great part of the essence of def. 2.2.8 1) is expressed by b). All above\napplies as well to the context of 2.2.8 3).\n1') 1) suggests the introduction of pseudo Shimura (filtered) \u03c3-crystals: instead of\na) of 2.2.8 1) we assume just b) of 2.2.8 1). Similarly, if b) and c) hold and a) holds after\na passage to W (k1 ), with k1 a finite field extension of k (resp. with k1 = k\u0304), then we\nspeak about quasi (resp. potentially) Shimura (filtered) \u03c3-crystals. Warning: for these\nnotions we still keep G to be a quasi-split reductive group over W (k). The greatest part\nof the terminology to be introduced below for Shimura \u03c3-crystals makes sense (and so it\nis used as well without extra comment) for these pseudo, quasi or potentially contexts.\n103\n\n\fWe have the following Galois interpretations. Not to introduce extra notations, we\nrefer to the context of a pseudo Shimura filtered \u03c3-crystal (M0 , F01 , \u03c60 , G\u03031 ) as in 1) (so\nG\u03031 is a quasi-split reductive group and G0 normalizes G1 ; for p = 2 we assume D0 exists).\nFact. (M0 , F01 , \u03c60 , G\u03031 ) is a Shimura (resp. quasi Shimura) filtered \u03c3-crystal iff G0\n(resp. the Zariski closure in GL(N0 ) of the connected component of the origin of G0Qp )\nis a subgroup of G1 .\nProof: Below we use freely the passage (via Fontaine's comparison theory) from tensors in the F 0 -filtration of T (M0 [ p1 ]) fixed by \u03c6 to tensors of T (N0 [ p1 ]) fixed by \u03c10 (\u0393k ). For\ninstance, it implies (via arguments involving torsors) G1Qp is a reductive group. So loc.\ncit. applies again to the representation of G1Qp on N0 [ p1 ]. Based on this, the part \"without quasi\" is obvious. We deal now with the part \"involving quasi\". If (M0 , F01 , \u03c60 , G\u03031 )\nis a quasi Shimura filtered \u03c3-crystal, then the image through \u03c10 of a compact, open subgroup of \u0393k is contained in G1 (Zp ) (see 2.2.8 a)); so the connected component of the\norigin of G0Qp is a subgroup of G1Qp .\nWe assume now that the connected component of the origin of G0Qp is a subgroup\nof G1Qp . So the canonical split cocharacter \u03bc : Gm \u2192 GL(M0 ) of (M0 , F01 , \u03c60 ), factors\nthrough G\u03031 . But, as G\u03031 is reductive, using an argument involving Qp -structures entirely\nsimilar to the one of the proof of the Fact of 1) but performed in the \u00e9tale context, we get\nthat the restriction of \u03c10 to \u0393k\u0304 factors through G1 (Zp ). So, as the number of connected\ncomponents of G0Qp is finite, we deduce the existence of a finite Galois extension k1 of\nk, such that the restriction of \u03c10 to \u0393k1 factors through G1 (Zp ). So, based once more on\na similar Qp -argument as in the proof of 1) but performed in the \u00e9tale context, we get\nthat the extension of (M0 , F01 , \u03c60 ) to k1 is a Shimura filtered \u03c3k1 -crystal. This ends the\nproof.\nAs in 2.2.8 7), we define endomorphisms of pseudo or quasi or potentially (filtered)\nShimura \u03c3-crystals.\n2) If in 2.2.8 1) we have F 1 (Lie(G)) 6= 0, then the pair (G, [\u03bc]) defines a Shimura\ngroup pair over Spec(W (k)). Similarly, the cocharacter \u03bcad : Gm \u2192 Gad (induced naturally by the cocharacter \u03bc of c') of 2.2.8 3)) is either trivial or gives birth (cf. 2.2.9 b'))\nto a Shimura adjoint group pair (Gad , [\u03bcad ]) over Spec(W (k)).\n3) We refer to 2.2.8 1). The G(W (k))-conjugacy class CCP of the parabolic Lie subalgebra F 0 (Lie(G)) of Lie(G), is uniquely determined by the Shimura \u03c3-crystal (M, \u03c6, G).\nThis is a consequence of the fact that the direct summand F 1 /pF 1 of M/pM is uniquely\ndetermined by \u03c6 and of the following Fact:\nFact 1. Two parabolic subgroups P1 and P2 of G having the same special fibre, are\nG(W (k))-conjugate.\nProof: As this well known result plays an important role in many parts of \u00a72-14,\nwe include a proof of it. Let Tk be a maximal torus of P1k = P2k and so of Gk (cf. [Bo2,\n18.2 (i)]). From [SGA3, Vol. II, 3.6 of p. 48] we deduce that Tk lifts to a maximal torus\nTi of Pi , i = 1, 2. To loc. cit. we need to add that:\n104\n\n\fSubfact. Any closed subscheme of G\u2227 which mod pm is a torus T\u0303m , \u2200m \u2208 N, is\nobtained by completing p-adically a uniquely determined torus T\u0303 of G.\nThe argument goes as follows. We can assume k = k\u0304 and G = GL(M ). We consider\nthe direct sum decomposition M/pm M = \u2295\u03b2\u2208CHm M\u03b2 (m), with CHm as the set of\ncharacters of T\u0303m , naturally defined by the action of T\u0303m on M/pn M . As T\u0303m+1 lifts T\u0303m ,\nCHm does not depend on m and so we can denote it by CH; moreover, \u2200\u03b2 \u2208 CH, there\nis (as M is p-adically complete) a direct summand M (\u03b2) of M such that M\u03b2 (m) is the\nreduction mod pm of it, \u2200m \u2208 N. So we get an action of the (abstract) torus T\u0303 whose\nreductions modulo positive, integral powers of p are T\u0303m 's, on M\u0303 : T\u0303 acts on M (\u03b2) via \u03b2.\nIt is a closed embedding (this is a matter of characters and so it follows from the fact\nthat mod p we have a closed embedding). The Subfact follows.\nThis addition to loc. cit. is not repeated in the subsequent places relying on it.\nAlso from loc. cit. we deduce the existence of g \u2208 G(W (k)) which mod p is the\nidentity, such that under its inner conjugation T1 is taken onto T2 . So we can assume\nT1 = T2 . But P1W (k\u0304) and P2W (k\u0304) are determined by the set of roots (i.e. of characters of\nT1W (k\u0304) ) of the action (via inner conjugation) of T1W (k\u0304) on their Lie algebras. As these\nsets can be read out from this action mod p, we get P1 = P2 . This ends the proof.\nWe call CCP as the filtration class of the Shimura \u03c3-crystal (M, \u03c6, G). About \u03bc (or\nthe G(W (k))-conjugacy class [\u03bc] defined by \u03bc) we say it defines CCP.\nFact 2. [\u03bc] itself is uniquely determined by (M, \u03c6, G).\nProof: Let \u03bc1 : Gm \u2192 G be another cocharacter producing (as in c) of 2.2.8 1))\na direct sum decomposition M = F11 \u2295 F10 such that (M, F11 , \u03c6, G) is a Shimura filtered\n\u03c3-crystal. Based on Fact 1 we can assume F10 (Lie(G)) = F 0 (Lie(G)). Let P0 be the\nparabolic subgroup of G having F 0 (Lie(G)) as its Lie algebra; both \u03bc and \u03bc1 factor\nthrough it. Let T be a maximal split torus of P0 : it is obtained by the usual lifting\nprocess (of loc. cit.), from a maximal split torus of P0k . Applying [Bo2, 15.14] to P0k , we\ncan assume that the special fibres of \u03bc and \u03bc1 factor through Tk . Based again on [SGA3,\nVol. II, 3.6 of p. 48] (applied to P0 and its cocharacters \u03bc and \u03bc1 ) we can assume \u03bc and\n\u03bc1 themselves factor through T . In particular, we get: their images are commuting to\neach other. As F11 /pF11 = F 1 /pF 1 , this implies F11 = F 1 and F0 = F01 ; so \u03bc = \u03bc1 . This\nends the proof.\nCorollary. The Gad (W (k))-conjugacy class [\u03bcad ] defined by the cocharacter \u03bcad :\nGm \u2192 Gad induced by \u03bc, is uniquely determined by (M, \u03c6, G). Moreover, if G is a torus,\nthen \u03bc itself is uniquely determined.\n4) Generalized Shimura p-divisible objects over k show up in this paper in: 3.1.7, the\nbeginning paragraph of 3.4 (and so implicitly in many parts of 3.4-5), 3.6.1.5-6, 3.15.6,\n4.5.6 8), 4.4.13, 4.9.18, 4.12.12.0, 4.14.2 and Appendix. They will be used much more\nfrequently in \u00a75-10 (cf. also 4.5.4 below). Similarly, the \"with a reductive structure\"\ncontext of 2.2.8 3a) and 4a) shows up concretely just in 3.13.7.8-9 and in Appendix. The\nwhole of 1), 1') and of 3) as well as the whole of 5), 6), 8), 9) and 10) below can be entirely\n105\n\n\fadapted to this last context: as no modifications are needed (besides always assuming in\n1) that \u03c10 exists), we do not restate the things. Warning: when we speak about pseudo\n(or quasi or potentially) p-divisible objects with a reductive structure, we do not assume\nthat the reductive group involved is quasi-split.\nWe use freely the terminology to be introduced for Shimura (filtered) \u03c3-crystals and\nwhich depends only on their attached (cf. 2.2.13 below) Shimura Lie \u03c3-crystals, in the\ncontext of generalized Shimura p-divisible objects over k or of MF (W (k)); as a sample\nsee 2.2.22 2) below. Any context involving generalized Shimura p-divisible objects is often\nreferred as a generalized Shimura context.\n5) When we want to emphasize a family of tensors (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J as in a) of 2.2.8 1), we\ndenote a Shimura \u03c3-crystal by a quadruple (M, \u03c6, G, (t\u03b1)\u03b1\u2208J ). Similarly we denote a\nShimura filtered \u03c3-crystal by a quintuple (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ). Strictly speaking we\nshould refer to (M, \u03c6, G, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ) as a Shimura \u03c3-crystal with an emphasized family of\ntensors but we rarely do so; the same about the filtered case.\nIf m \u2208 N \u222a {0} is such that all homogeneous components of t\u03b1 are of degree at most\nm, \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 J , then we say (M, \u03c6, G) is of degree at most m; by the degree\ndeg(M, \u03c6, G) \u2208 N \u222a {0}\nwe mean the smallest such possible value m, where the family (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J is allowed to vary\nsubject to the constraint of a) of 2.2.8 1). If deg(M, \u03c6, G) = 0, then G = GL(M ).\n6) If (M, \u03c6, G, (t\u03b1)\u03b1\u2208J ) and (M1 , \u03c61 , G1 , (t1\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J1 ) (resp. if (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J )\nand (M1 , F11 , \u03c61 , G1 , (t1\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J1 )) are two Shimura (resp. two Shimura filtered) \u03c3-crystals,\nthen an isomorphism between them is given by an isomorphism t : M \u2192M\n \u0303 1 taking the triple (\u03c6, G, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ) into (\u03c61 , G1 , (t1\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J1 ) (resp. taking the quadruple\n \u0303 1 is a bijection and if the\n(F 1 , \u03c6, G, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ) into (F11 , \u03c61 , G1 , (t1\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J1 )). If j : J \u2192J\nisomorphism t takes t\u03b1 into t1j(\u03b1) , then we call t a j-isomorphism. In particular, an 1J isomorphism between two Shimura \u03c3-crystals (M, \u03c6, G, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ) and (M, \u03c61 , G, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J )\nis given by an element g \u2208 G(W (k)) such that \u03c61 = g\u03c6g \u22121 . An isomorphism of (M, \u03c6, G)\ndoes not need to fix the family of tensors (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ; easy examples can be constructed if\nk = Fp and so, by natural extension, over any k.\nWarning: the 1J -automorphisms are not in general those endomorphisms which are\ninvertible.\n7) The condition G quasi-split, used in 2.2.8 1) to 4), is not really needed (cf. 3.8\nbelow). It is inserted just to be able to be concrete in 3.2.3 below. Also Theorem 2.3.9\nbelow makes it very convenient for applications to Shimura varieties of Hodge type. When\nwe do not know that G is quasi-split or when it is not, we speak about a Shimura (filtered)\n\u03c3-crystal of being not necessarily quasi-split.\n8) If in 2.2.8 1) we have k = k\u0304, then writing \u03c6 = a \u25e6 \u03bc( p1 ), a becomes a \u03c3-linear\nautomorphism of M and so of T (M ) (and in particular of Lie(G)), and\nM a := {x \u2208 M |a(x) = x}\n106\n\n\fis a free Zp -module of rank dimW (k) (M ). Moreover,\nLie(G)a := {x \u2208 Lie(G)|a(x) = x} = Lie(G) \u2229 End(M )a \u2282 End(M a )\nis the Lie algebra of a reductive subgroup GZp of GL(M a ); the extension of GZp to W (k)\nis the reductive subgroup G of GL(M ). As \u03bc and \u03c6 fix t\u03b1 , we have t\u03b1 \u2208 T (M a )[ p1 ],\n\u2200\u03b1 \u2208 J .\nLet B(Fpd ) be the field of definition of the G(B(k))-conjugacy class of the cocharacter\n\u03bcB(k) : Gm \u2192 GB(k) (cf. [Mi3, 4.6-7] applied to GQp ; GQp splits over a finite unramified\nextension of Qp ). Here d \u2208 N. Let TZp be a maximal torus of GZp which over W (Fpd )\ncontains a maximal split torus of GW (Fpd ) . Let \u03bc0 : Gm \u2192 GW (Fpd ) be a cocharacter\nwhich over W (k) is G(W (k))-conjugate to \u03bc and which factors through TW (Fpd ) . The\nexistence of \u03bc0 is guaranteed by loc. cit. and by the fact (see [Ti2]) that the generic fibre\nof a split torus of GW (Fpd ) is a maximal split torus of GB(Fpd ) . We deduce the existence of\n\u0001\nan element g \u2208 G(W (k)) such that the Shimura filtered \u03c3-crystal M, F 1 , g\u03c6, G, (t\u03b1)\u03b1\u2208J\nis 1J -isomorphic to the extension to k of a Shimura filtered \u03c3-crystal\n\u0001\n1\nM a \u2297Zp W (Fpd ), F\u03bc10 , a \u25e6 \u03bc0 ( ), GW (Fpd ) , (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J\np\nover Fpd , where F\u03bc10 \u2282 M a \u2297Zp W (Fpd ) is the F 1 -filtration associated as usual to \u03bc0 (here\nwe still denote by a its restriction to M a \u2297Zp W (Fpd )). If G is a torus, then g = 1M .\nSo, from many points of view, for the study of Shimura \u03c3-crystals over a perfect field\nk0 of characteristic p, we can assume k0 is a finite field (if k0 6= k0 , then passing to a\nfinite field extension k1 of k0 , M a , defined as above but working with g(\u03c6 \u2297 1) instead of\n\u03c6 for a suitable g \u2208 G(W (k1 )), is still a free Zp -module of rank dimW (k) (M )).\n9) Any filtered \u03c3-crystal (M, F 1 , \u03c6), with F 1 a proper direct summand of M , is identified with the Shimura filtered \u03c3-crystal (M, F 1 , \u03c6, GL(M )), and any \u03c3-crystal (M, \u03c6)\nwhich can be extended to a filtered \u03c3-crystal (M, F 1 , \u03c6), with F 1 a proper direct summand of M , is identified with the Shimura \u03c3-crystal (M, \u03c6, GL(M )).\n10) Any Shimura (filtered) \u03c3-crystal over k gives birth to a Shimura (filtered) isocrystal over k, by making p invertible. But not any Shimura (filtered) isocrystal over k is\nobtained in this manner: for instance, the Shimura isocrystals over k can have slopes\nwhich do not belong to the interval [0, 1] and the reductive groups involved are not necessarily quasi-split.\n11) The condition (of 2.2.8 1)) F 1 is a proper direct summand of M as well as the\ncondition (of 2.2.8 3)) at least two of the submodules F\u0303 i 's are different from {0}, are\ninserted just to avoid the trivial cases. So the cocharacter \u03bc of c) of 2.2.8 1) (or of c')\nof 2.2.8 3)) does not factor through the center of GL(M ). When we have F 1 = {0} or\nF 1 = M in 2.2.8 1) (resp. we have M = F\u0303 i for some i \u2208 S(a, b) in 2.2.8 3)), we speak\nabout a trivial Shimura (filtered) \u03c3-crystal (resp. about a trivial generalized Shimura\np-divisible object of MF (W (k))). Without a special reference, we always assume we are\nin a non-trivial situation.\n107\n\n\f12) For the sake of flexibility it is important in 2.2.8 1) not to assume that (M, \u03c6)\nhas a principal quasi-polarization or that dimW (k) (F 1 ) = dimW (k) (F 0 ) (as we have in\nsituations emerging from principally polarized abelian varieties over W (k)). So we completely ignore the phenomenon of Tate-twists. However, when we have a principal quasipolarization\npM : M \u2297W (k) M \u2192 W (k)(1)\nnormalized by G, we speak about a principally quasi-polarized Shimura (filtered) \u03c3crystal. As notation, we put pM as part of some n-tuple at the very end; example: (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J , pM ). Moreover we do not assume GB(k) is the subgroup of\nGL(M [ p1 ]) fixing t\u03b1 , \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 J : we just assume it is the subgroup of GSp(M [ p1 ], pM ) fixing\nthese tensors.\nLet now k = k\u0304. We consider a Zp -structure GZp of G obtained as in 8). As \u03bc is\ninjective, G does not fix pM . So Z(GZp ) contains a split torus of dimension 1 which\nnormalizes pM without fixing it. The elements of Z(GZp )(Zp ) are naturally identified\nwith 1J -automorphisms of (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G, (t\u03b1)\u03b1\u2208J ) but not of (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J , pM ).\n2.2.10. Shimura filtered F -crystals. Let (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G) be a Shimura filtered \u03c3crystal. Let H be a smooth subscheme of G such that the origin of G factors through H.\nLet R be the W (k)-algebra of the completion of H at this factorization o. We consider\na W (k)-isomorphism f \u0303 : R\u2192W\n \u0303 (k)[[x1 , . . . , xd ]], with d the relative dimension of H over\nW (k) in o; we view it as an identification. Let \u03a6R be the Frobenius lift of R taking (via\nthis identification) xi to xpi , i = 1, d. Let \u03a9\u0304R/W (k) be the free R-submodule of \u03a9R/W (k)\ngenerated by dx1 ,..., dxd .\nWe consider the p-divisible object of MF[0,1] (R) defined by the following triple\n(M \u2297W (k) R, F 1 \u2297W (k) R, \u03a6), with\n\u03a6 := h(\u03c6 \u2297 id)\ndefined by the universal element h \u2208 H(R) of H. [Fa2, th. 10] guarantees that there is a\nunique connection\n\u2207 : M \u2297W (k) R \u2192 M \u2297W (k) \u03a9\u0304R/W (k)\nsuch that \u03a6 is \u2207-parallel in the sense of [Fa2, ch. 7]; from [Fa2, th. 10] we also deduce it\nis integrable and nilpotent mod p. In 3.6.18.4 we reobtain in a completely new manner\nthe existence and the uniqueness of \u2207, while in 3.6.18.4.1 we reobtain in a completely\nnew manner the fact that \u2207 is automatically integrable and nilpotent mod p.\nThe quadruple\n(M \u2297W (k) R, F 1 \u2297W (k) R, \u03a6, \u2207)\nis a filtered F -crystal over R/pR. We call it a Shimura filtered F -crystal over R/pR\n(defined by (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G)) and we denote it by a sextuple\n \u0303\n(M, F 1 , \u03c6, G, H, f).\n108\n\n\f \u0303 when d = 0 we keep denoting\nWhen H = G, we denote it by a quintuple (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G, f);\nit by (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G). Usually H is a smooth subgroup of G. When we want to emphasize\nthe family of tensors (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J , then\n\u0001 we denote a Shimura filtered F -crystal also by a\n1\n \u0303\n7-tuple M, F , \u03c6, G, H, f, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J and then, by abuse of notation (cf. 2.1), we still\nwrite (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J for this family of tensors, when viewed as being formed by tensors of\nT (M \u2297W (k) R[ p1 ]). We have:\nFact 1. \u2207(t\u03b1 ) = 0, \u03a6(t\u03b1 ) = t\u03b1 and t\u03b1 belongs to the F 0 -filtration of T (M \u2297W (k)\nR[ p1 ]) defined by F 1 [ p1 ], \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 J .\nThe fact that \u2207(t\u03b1 ) = 0 is implied by [Fa2, rm. ii) after th. 10], while the other\nparts of Fact 1 are obvious. So the R-linear endomorphism of M \u2297W (k) R taking m \u2208 M\n\u2202\n)(m) belongs to Lie(G) \u2297W (k) R, \u2200i \u2208 S(1, d). Accordingly, we still denote by\ninto \u2207( \u2202x\ni\n\u2207 the natural connection on T (M ) \u2297W (k) R or on N \u2297W (k) R, with N a direct summand\nof T (M ) normalized by G, induced by the connection \u2207 on M \u2297W (k) R; in particular,\nthis applies to Lie(G) \u2297W (k) R \u2282 (M \u2297W (k) M \u2217 ) \u2297W (k) R.\nFact 1 implies directly the following two Facts:\nFact 2. The quadruple\n(Lie(G) \u2297W (k) R, \u03a6, F 0(Lie(G)) \u2297W (k) R, F 1 (Lie(G)) \u2297W (k) R, \u2207)\nis a filtered Lie F -crystal over R/pR.\nFact 3. For any point of Spec(R/pR) with values in a perfect field k1 , we get from\n \u0303 by pulling back, a Shimura \u03c3k -crystal over k1 .\n(M, F 1 , \u03c6, G, H, f)\n1\nSimilarly to the end of 2.2.1 c) or to 2.2.9 12), we speak about principally quasipolarized Shimura filtered F -crystals. Moreover, the conventions of 2.2.9 12) apply as\nwell. Warning: if (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G, pM ) is a principally quasi-polarized Shimura filtered \u03c3crystal, then whenever we want to keep pM as the cycle of a principal quasi-polarization\n \u0303 we need to take H to be as well a subscheme of Sp(M, pM ).\nof (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G, H, f),\n2.2.10.1. Comments. 2.2.10 can be performed as well for the context of a W (k)morphism fH : H \u2192 G for which there is a W (k)-morphism zH : Spec(W (k)) \u2192 H\nsuch that zH \u25e6 fH is the origin of G, with H an arbitrary regular, formally smooth\nW (k)-scheme (so Spec(R) is now the completion of H in zH ). The resulting quadruple\n(M \u2297W (k) R, F 1 \u2297W (k) R, \u03a6, \u2207) is still referred as a Shimura filtered F -crystal over R/pR\nbut the notation is (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G, fH \u25e6 zH , f \u0303).\nHowever, in such a generality we often prefer to speak about filtered F -crystals (with\ntensors) over the special fibre SH = Spec(R/pR) of the completion of H in zH : we feel\ninclined to reserve the terminology Shimura filtered F -crystals just for contexts where we\ndo have some closed embedding into the completion of G in its origin. Similarly, when we\n\u2207\nare in the context of a p-divisible object with tensors of MF[0,1]\n(H) which is modeled on\n2.2.10, then we often prefer to use the alternating terminology filtered F -crystals (with\ntensors) instead of the one of Shimura filtered F -crystals.\n109\n\n\fAny Shimura (filtered) \u03c3-crystal over k is a Shimura (filtered) F -crystal over k; we\nuse this second terminology only when k is not specified.\n2.2.11. Definitions. 1)\n\u0001 A non-trivial Shimura filtered Lie \u03c3-crystal is a filtered Lie\n0\n1\n\u03c3-crystal g, \u03c6, F (g), F (g) , with g the Lie algebra of a reductive group G over W (k),\nfor which there is an injective cocharacter \u03bc : Gm \u0592\u2192 Gad such that:\n\u2013 (Gad , [\u03bc]) is a Shimura group pair over Spec(W (k));\n\u2013 it defines F 0 (g) and F 1 (g); in other words, we have g = g0 \u2295 g1 \u2295 g\u22121 , with g1 6= 0,\nwith \u03b2 \u2208 Gm (W (k)) acting through \u03bc on gi as the multiplication with \u03b2 \u2212i , i = \u22121, 1,\nand with F 1 (g) = g1 and F 0 (g) = g0 \u2295 g1 .\n2) A non-trivial Shimura Lie \u03c3-crystal is a Lie \u03c3-crystal (g, \u03c6) \u0001which can be extended\u0001\nto a non-trivial Shimura filtered Lie \u03c3-crystal g, \u03c6, F 0 (g), F 1 (g) . g, \u03c6, F 0 (g), F 1 (g)\nor just F 0 (g) itself is called a lift of (g, \u03c6); as F 1 (g) is determined by F 0 (g), being its\nnilpotent radical, we never refer to (F 0 (g), F 1 (g)) as a lift of (g, \u03c6).\nWriting \u03c6 = a \u25e6 \u03bc( p1 ), a is a \u03c3-linear automorphism of g, whose class\n[a] \u2208 Aut\u03c3\u2212lin (g)/Gad (W (k))\n(modulo inner automorphisms of g) does not depend (cf. Corollary of 2.2.9 3)) on the\nchoice of \u03bc. We call [a] the automorphism class of (g, \u03c6).\n3) A Lie \u03c3-crystal (g, \u03c6), with g the Lie algebra of a reductive group G over W (k)\nand with \u03c6(g) = g, is called a trivial Shimura Lie \u03c3-crystal; in such a case the quadruple\n(g, \u03c6, g, {0}) is referred as a trivial Shimura filtered Lie \u03c3-crystal. When we do not bother\nabout trivial or non-trivial, we speak about Shimura (filtered) Lie \u03c3-crystals.\n4) If in 1) to 3), G is an adjoint group then we speak about a Shimura adjoint\n(filtered) Lie \u03c3-crystal.\n2.2.11.1. Remark. We refer to 2.2.11 1) and 2). From the existence of \u03bc we get:\nF 0 (g) is a parabolic Lie subalgebra of g, having F 1 (g) as its nilpotent radical. Facts 1 and\n2 of 2.2.9 3) apply entirely, cf. the below general Fact and the fact that F 0 (g)/pF 0 (g) is\nuniquely determined by \u03c6, being the kernel of the restriction to g/pg of p\u03c6 mod p. So we\nuse the same terminology: the Gad (W (k))-conjugacy class of F 0 (g) is called the filtration\nclass of (g, \u03c6) and we say that [\u03bc] (or just \u03bc or F 0 (g)) defines it.\n1\n2\nFact. We consider two parabolic subgroups PH\nand PH\nof a reductive group H over\na field L. The following four statements are equivalent:\n1\n2\na) PH\nis a subgroup of PH\n;\n2\n1\nb) Lie(PH ) \u2282 Lie(PH );\n2\n2\n1\n1\nc) The unipotent radical NH\nof PH\nis a subgroup of the unipotent radical NH\nof PH\n;\n1\n2\nd) Lie(NH ) \u2282 Lie(NH ).\n1\nPH\n\nProof: We can assume we are over an algebraically closed field. It is known that\n2\n\u2229 PH\ncontains a maximal torus of H (see [Bo2, 14.22 (ii)]). So the fact that a) is\n110\n\n\fequivalent to b) follows from [Bo2, 14.17-18]. Similarly we get that c) is equivalent to d).\nFrom loc. cit. we also get that a) implies c). We now assume c) holds. From [Bo2, 14.22\n1\n2\n(i)] we get that PH\n\u2229 PH\nis a parabolic subgroup of H. Using [Bo2, 14.17-18] once more,\nwe get that a) holds. This ends the proof.\n\u0001\n2.2.12. Definitions. Let g, \u03c6, F 0 (g), F 1 (g) be a Shimura\nfiltered Lie \u03c3-crystal.\n\u0001\n0\n1\nWe use the notations of 2.2.3 3) for (g, \u03c6). g, \u03c6, F (g), F (g) is said to be:\na) of parabolic type, if p\u22650 \u2282 F 0 (g);\nb) of Borel type, if there is a Borel Lie subalgebra b of g contained in F 0 (g) and\nsuch that \u03c6(b) \u2282 b;\nb\u2032 ) of strong Borel type, if it is of Borel type and if the parabolic Lie subalgebra of g\ncorresponding to non-negative slopes of (g, \u03c6) is a Borel Lie subalgebra (so there is only\none parabolic Lie subalgebra of g contained in F 0 (g) and taken by \u03c6 into itself);\nc) cyclic diagonalizable (if the permutation \u03c0 of ii) below is 1A , then we drop the\nword cyclic), if there is a W (k)-basis {ei |i \u2208 A} of g, with A := S(1, dimW (k) (g)) assumed\nto be non-empty, such that the following three conditions are satisfied\ni) for subsets C \u2282 B \u2282 A, {ei |i \u2208 C} is a W (k)-basis of F 1 (g) and {ei |i \u2208 B} is a\nW (k)-basis of F 0 (g);\nii) there is a permutation \u03c0 of A for which we have \u03c6(ei ) = p\u03b5i e\u03c0(i) , with \u03b5i \u2208 {\u22121, 0, 1}\nequal to 1 if i \u2208 C, equal to 0 if i \u2208 B\\C and equal to \u22121 if i \u2208 A\\B;\niii) \u2200i, j \u2208 A, either [ei , ej ] \u2208 W (k)ek(i,j) , for some k(i, j) \u2208 A, or a power of \u03c6 acts\ntrivially on [ei , ej ].\nd) of toric type, if the Lie subalgebra of g corresponding to the slope 0 of (g, \u03c6) is\ncontained in F 0 (g).\n2.2.12.1. Remarks. 1) We refer to the context of 2.2.12 a). As p\u22650 \u2282 F 0 (Lie(G)),\nat the level of their unipotent radicals we have F 1 (Lie(G)) \u2282 p>0 . We get a filtered\n\u03c3-crystal\n(p\u22650 , F 1 (Lie(G)), \u03c6).\nA p-divisible group D (resp. Dk ) over W (k) (resp. over k) whose associated filtered \u03c3crystal (resp. \u03c3-crystal) is (p\u22650 , F 1 (Lie(G)), \u03c6) (resp. is (p\u22650 , \u03c6)), is called a p-divisible\ngroup of (g, \u03c6, F 0 (g), F 1 (g)) (resp. of (g, \u03c6)). Dk is always uniquely determined (cf. [Fo,\np. 152 and p. 160]). If p \u2265 3, then D itself is uniquely determined (cf. loc. cit. and [Me,\nch. 4-5], or cf. 2.2.1.1 2); see also [Fo, ch. 4, \u00a75]). For p = 2, D still exists: we can take\nit to be the direct sum of an \u00e9tale 2-divisible group with a 2-divisible group having all\nslopes in the interval (0, 1) (cf. the fact that F 1 (Lie(G)) \u2282 W\u03b5 (p\u22650 , \u03c6) for \u03b5 > 0 small\nenough; see also 2.3.18.1 C below).\nSimilarly, in the context of 2.2.12 b), we get a filtered \u03c3-crystal (b, F 1 (Lie(G)), \u03c6). So\nthe triple (g/b, F 0 (g)/b, \u03c6) is a p-divisible object of MF[\u22121,0] (W (k)). So p>0 is contained\nin b and so in F 0 (g).\n2) From many points of view, the study of Shimura filtered Lie \u03c3-crystals of parabolic\nor Borel type, gets reduced to the study of suitable filtered \u03c3-crystals. In general, the\n111\n\n\fsimplest type of p-divisible objects of MF[\u22121,1] (W (k)), are those which are the extension\nof a p-divisible object of MF[\u22121,0] (W (k)) (resp. of MF[0,1] (W (k))) by a p-divisible object\nof MF[0,1] (W (k)) (resp. of MF[\u22121,0] (W (k))).\n3) A Shimura filtered Lie \u03c3-crystal of parabolic type is of toric type; but the converse\nis not true (for examples see 4.4.13 below).\n4) If k = k\u0304, then in 2.2.12 c) it is enough to assume \u03c6(ei ) is p\u03b5i e\u03c0(i) times an\ninvertible element of W (k). The same applies to 2.2.1 d).\n5) Condition iii) of 2.2.12 c) is included in order to keep better track of the Lie\nstructure (to be compared with 2.2.1 d)); we rarely make use of it. Warning: in iii) of\n2.2.12 c) it is unreasonable to require [ei , ej ] \u2208 Zek(i,j) instead of [ei , ej ] \u2208 W (k)ek(i,j) .\n2.2.13. Remarks. Any Shimura \u03c3-crystal (M, \u03c6, G) has attached to it (cf. b) of\n2.2.8 1)) a Shimura Lie \u03c3-crystal\n(Lie(G), \u03c6). It also has attached to it a Shimura adjoint\n\u0001\nLie \u03c3-crystal Lie(Gad ), \u03c6 (we always identify Lie(Gad ) with a W (k)-Lie subalgebra\nof Lie(Gder )[ p1 ] and so of Lie(G)[ p1 ]). Argument: if F 1 is a lift of (M, \u03c6, G), then the\nquadruple\n\u0001\nLie(Gad ), \u03c6, F 0 (Lie(Gad )), F 1 (Lie(Gad )) ,\n\nwith F i (Lie(Gad )) := Lie(Gad ) \u2229 F i (End(M ))[ p1 ], i = 0, 1, is a Shimura adjoint filtered\nLie \u03c3-crystal (we can assume k = k\u0304 and so we can refer to 2.2.9 8): Lie(Gad\nZp ) is included\n1\n1\nin Lie(GQp ) and so is fixed by a; moreover \u03bc( p ) normalizes Lie(Gad )[ p ]). Similarly, for\nany Shimura filtered \u03c3-crystal we speak about the Shimura (adjoint) filtered Lie \u03c3-crystal\nattached to it. The same applies to the generalized Shimura context.\n\nWe refer to 2.2.2 4). We assume g is the Lie algebra of an adjoint group G over\nR\u2227 . Then we refer to L as a Shimura adjoint filtered Lie F -crystal over R/pR. The fact\nthat this matches with 2.2.11 1) and 4) for R = W (k) can be checked as follows. The\ncomposite homomorphism\nAd\n\nG \u2192 Aut(g) \u0592\u2192 GL(g)\nis a closed embedding (for the passage from B(k) to W (k), cf. [Va2, 3.1.2.1 c)]) and\nunder it GB(k) is the connected component of the origin of Aut(g)B(k) . So the canonical\nsplit cocharacter of (g, F 0 (g), F 1 (g), \u03c6) factors through Aut(g) (cf. the functorial aspect\nof it and the Lie structure of L) and so through G. We also get: for R = W (k), G is\nuniquely determined.\n2.2.13.1. An interpretation. We consider a Shimura adjoint Lie \u03c3-crystal (g, \u03c6).\nLet G be as above. Then the triple (g, \u03c6, G) is a quasi p-divisible object with a reductive structure over k (starting from the above part referring to Aut(g)B(k) , this can be\nchecked as in Fact of 2.2.9 1')). Also, if (g, \u03c6, F 0 (g), F 1 (g)) is a lift of (g, \u03c6), then the\nquintuple (g, F 0 (g), F 1 (g), \u03c6, G) is a quasi p-divisible object with a reductive structure\nof MF[\u22121,1] (W (k)).\n2.2.13.2. Terminology. Whenever we want to emphasize k in 2.2.11, we speak\nabout a Shimura (adjoint) (filtered) Lie \u03c3-crystal of being over k. If the reductive group\n112\n\n\fG is split, then we speak about split Shimura (adjoint) (filtered) (Lie) \u03c3-crystals. If\njust Gad is split then we speak about split Shimura (adjoint) (filtered) Lie \u03c3-crystals.\nWe also speak about Shimura (adjoint) (filtered) Lie isocrystals (over k), obtained from\nShimura (adjoint) (filtered) Lie \u03c3-crystals, by making p invertible. For instance, with the\nnotations of 2.2.8 1), (Lie(G)[ p1 ], \u03c6) is a Shimura Lie isocrystal.\n2.2.13.3. Remark. Let (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G) be a Shimura \u03c3-crystal. Let P be the\nparabolic subgroup of G having F 0 (Lie(G)) as its Lie algebra. Let P 1 be its image in\nGad . From Fact 1 and Fact 2 of 2.2.9 3), as PB(k) is its own normalizer in GB(k) , we get\nthat the lifts of (M, \u03c6, G) are in bijection with the W (k)-valued points of the completion\nof G/P in its W (k)-valued point defined by the origin of G. Similarly, from 2.2.11.1 we\nget that the lifts of the Shimura (adjoint) Lie \u03c3-crystal attached to (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G) are in\nbijection with the W (k)-valued points of the completion of Gad /P 1 in its W (k)-valued\npoint defined by the origin of Gad . As P contains Z(G), G/P can be canonically identified\nwith Gad /P 1 . We get:\nFact. Any lift of the Shimura (adjoint) Lie \u03c3-crystal attached to (M, \u03c6, G) is defined\nuniquely (via the attachment process) by a lift of (M, \u03c6, G).\n2.2.13.4. Variants. Referring to 2.2.8 3a) and 4a), we similarly define the (adjoint)\nfiltered [a\u2212b, b\u2212a]-Lie \u03c3-crystal attached to a p-divisible object with a reductive structure\nof MF[a,b] (W (k)) and the (adjoint) b \u2212 a-Lie \u03c3-crystal attached to a p-divisible object\nwith a reductive structure over k in the range [a, b].\n2.2.14. Truncations. Let n \u2208 N and let (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G) be a Shimura filtered\n\u03c3-crystal. By its truncation mod pn we mean the quintuple\n(M/pn M, F 1 /pn F 1 , \u03c6, \u03c61 , GWn (k) ),\nwhere (M/pn M, F 1 /pn F 1 , \u03c6, \u03c61 ) is the truncation mod pn of (M, F 1 , \u03c6) (here as well as\nbelow we denote different reductions of \u03c6 still by \u03c6 and not by \u03c60 ). As in 2.2.9 6) we\ndefine the notion of isomorphism between truncations mod pn of two Shimura filtered\n\u03c3-crystals over k.\nFor each \u03b1 \u2208 J such that t\u03b1 6= 0, let m(\u03b1) \u2208 Z be the smallest integer such that\nm(\u03b1)\np\nt\u03b1 \u2208 T (M ); if t\u03b1 = 0 let m(\u03b1) = 0. Let tn\u03b1 be the reduction mod pn of pm(\u03b1) t\u03b1 : it\nis an element of T (M/pn M ). The quintuple\n(M/pn M, F 1 /pn F 1 , \u03c6, \u03c61 , GWn (k) ), (tn\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J )\nis called the truncation mod pn of (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G, (t\u03b1)\u03b1\u2208J ). Similarly, if VM is the \u03c3 \u22121 linear endomorphism of M such that \u03c6 \u25e6 VM = p1M , the quadruple (resp. quintuple)\n(M/pn M, \u03c6, VM , GWn (k) )\n(resp. (M/pn M, \u03c6, VM , GWn (k) , (tn\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J )) is called the truncation mod pn of (M, \u03c6, G)\n(resp. of (M, \u03c6, G, (t\u03b1)\u03b1\u2208J )). We refer to (M/pn M, F 1 /pn F 1 , \u03c6, \u03c61 , GWn (k) ) as a lift of\n113\n\n\f(M/pn M, \u03c6, VM , GWn (k) ); the same applies to the context with tensors. Above, we still\nwrite VM for its reductions mod pn .\nAs in 2.2.8 7) and 2.2.9 6) we define endomorphisms and automorphisms and (in\nthe context of tensors 1J -automorphisms) of these truncations mod pn . Warning: in\ngeneral, GWn (k) is not the subgroup of GL(M/pn M ) fixing tn\u03b1 , \u2200 \u2208 J . So by an inner\n1J -automorphism of any of the mentioned truncations mod pn involving tensors, we mean\nan automorphism defined by an element of G(Wn (k)).\nWe have variants of the above definitions, in the principally quasi-polarized context.\nPutting aside the part involving Verschiebung maps and tensors, we have a variant of\ntruncations in the Shimura filtered Lie context. In particular, we speak (cf. end of 2.2.13)\nabout inner automorphisms of Shimura adjoint (filtered) Lie \u03c3-crystals.\n2.2.14.0. Exercise. Let \u03bc and F 0 be as in 2.2.8 c). Let a be the \u03c3-linear automorphism of M such that \u03c6 = a \u25e6 \u03bc( p1 ). We still denote by a its reduction mod p. If g1 ,\ng2 \u2208 G(W (k)) are such that the truncations mod p of (M, g1 \u03c6, G) and (M, g2 \u03c6, G) are\nidentical, show that g2\u22121 g1 mod p belongs to the connected, smooth, unipotent subgroup\nNk of Gk centralizing a(F 0 /pF 0 ) and M/pM/a(F 0 /pF 0 ) (so the Lie algebra of Nk is the\nimage of the \u03c3-linear endomorphism of Lie(Gk ) defined by p\u03c6). Hint: we can assume\nG = GL(M ).\n2.2.14.1. Remark. Using the functorial aspect of the canonical split cocharacters\nof [Wi], 2.2.1.2 as well as such cocharacters make sense in the context of objects of\nMF (W (k)). In detail: any such object Ob is the cokernel of an isogeny m : Ob1 \u0592\u2192 Ob2\nbetween two p-divisible objects of MF (W (k)) (cf. Fact of 2.2.1.1 6)); using standard\nproperties (as in the part of 2.2.1.0 referring to A and B) of abelian categories (cf. 2.2.1.1\n6)) the canonical cocharacter \u03bcOb of the GL-group of the underlying W (k)-module of Ob\nobtained from the canonical split cocharacters of the GL-groups of the underlying W (k)modules of Ob1 and Ob2 by passing to quotients, is independent of the choice of m.\nIn particular, working with Ob := (M/pn M, F 1 /pn F 1 , \u03c6, \u03c61 ) we get a canonical\ncocharacter\n\u03bcOb : Gm \u2192 GL(M/pn M )\nfactoring through GWn (k) and producing a direct sum decomposition\nM/pn M = F 1 /pn F 1 \u2295 Fn0 ,\nwith \u03b2 \u2208 Gm (Wn (k)) acting through \u03bcOb trivially on Fn0 and as the multiplication by\n\u03b2 \u22121 on F 1 /pn F 1 . Fn0 is the reduction mod pn of the maximal direct summand of M\non which the canonical split cocharacter of (M, F 1 , \u03c6) acts trivially. Usually we use\nthe canonical aspect of \u03bcOb in the form: it does not depend on which Shimura filtered\n\u03c3-crystal (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G) we use to define Ob.\n2.2.14.2. Fontaine truncations. The above approach to truncations of (M, \u03c6, G)\nmodulo powers of p does not generalize to the context of p-divisible objects of MF (W (k))\nor more generally of MF \u2207 (X) or of MF (X), with X as in 2.2.1 c). So here we propose\n114\n\n\fa second approach whose generalization is entirely trivial. Not to be long, we work\ndirectly with a p-divisible object (M, (F i (M ))i\u2208S(a,b) , \u03c6, G) with a reductive structure of\nMF[a,b] (W (k)). As for s \u2208 S(a, b), we have\n\u2212s\n\n(p\n\n\u03c6)\n\n\u22121\n\n(M ) \u2229 M =\n\ns\u2212a\nX\n\npj F s\u2212j (M ),\n\nj=0\n\nby decreasing induction on s we get that the filtration (F i (M )/pF i (M ))i\u2208S(a,b) of M/pM\nis uniquely determined by (M, \u03c6, G). Based on this, following entirely the proofs of 2.2.9\n3), we also get:\nFact. Any other filtration (F1i (M ))i\u2208S(a,b) of M such that (M, (F1i (M ))i\u2208S(a,b), \u03c6, G)\nis a p-divisible object with a reductive structure of MF[a,b] (W (k)), is uniquely determined by (M, \u03c6, G) up to conjugation by elements of G(W (k)) which take F i (M ) into\nPi\u2212a j i\u2212j\n(M ), \u2200i \u2208 S(a, b).\nj=0 p F\n\nObviously, such elements of G(W (k)) normalize (F i (M )/pF i (M ))i\u2208S(a,b) . Warning: if (M, \u03c6, G) is a generalized Shimura p-divisible object over k, then any element of\nG(W (k)) normalizing (F i (M )/pF i (M ))i\u2208S(a,b) is such that, \u2200i \u2208 S(a, b), it takes F i (M )\nPi\u2212a\ninto j=0 pj F i\u2212j (M ); but this does not hold in the general case.\nLet F be the set of all filtrations (F1i (M ))i\u2208S(a,b) of M as in the Fact. By Fontaine\ntruncation mod pn of (M, \u03c6, G) we mean the set\nFn ((M, \u03c6, G))\nof isomorphism classes of truncations mod pn of lifts of (M, \u03c6, G) defined by elements\nof F . Similarly we define Fn ((M, \u03c6, G, (t\u03b1)\u03b1\u2208J )) (resp. Fninner ((M, \u03c6, G, (t\u03b1)\u03b1\u2208J ))) by\nspeaking about isomorphism classes (resp. inner isomorphism classes) of truncations\nmod pn of (arbitrary) lifts of (M, \u03c6, G, (t\u03b1)\u03b1\u2208J ). Here inner isomorphisms refers as:\nisomorphisms between two such lifts defined by elements of G(Wn (k)).\nA last thing: the Fact of 2.2.13.3 can be entirely adapted to the context of lifts of\n(M, \u03c6, G) and of its attached adjoint.\n2.2.14.3. Weak truncations. If (M, \u03c6, G, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ) is a p-divisible object with a\nreductive structure of MF[0,a] (W (k)), with a \u2208 N \u222a {0}, by its weak truncation mod pn\nwe mean the quadruple (M/pn M, \u03c6, GWn (k) , (tn\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ), with tn\u03b1 's defined as in 2.2.14, and\nwith \u03c6 still denoting its reduction mod pn .\n2.2.15. Comment. Though G. Shimura never dealt with the type of crystals we\nhave introduced, we still feel that the terminology Shimura crystals used in 2.2-14 is\nappropriate, as G. Shimura was the first one (see the report [Sh]) to consider abelian\nvarieties endowed with (algebraic) cycles whose adequate integral crystalline realization\nare providing the very first examples of the type of \u03c3-crystals with extra structure defined\nin 2.2.8 2). Similarly we think the terminology Shimura group or Lie pair is justified. One\n115\n\n\fcould argue if defs. 2.2.8 5) and 6) are justified. We think it is a convenient terminology,\nvery much related to the one introduced in 2.2.8 1) to 4); the study of such isocrystals,\nto our knowledge, was started (motivated by the context of Shimura varieties of Hodge\ntype) implicitly in [Ko1].\n2.2.16. Lemma. We assume k = k\u0304. Let (M, F 1 , \u03c6) be a filtered \u03c3-crystal over k,\nwith F 1 a proper direct summand of M . It is cyclic diagonalizable iff there is a torus T\nof GL(M ) such that (M, F 1 , \u03c6, T ) is a Shimura filtered \u03c3-crystal.\nProof: If (M, F 1 , \u03c6) is cyclic diagonalizable, then we take T to be the maximal\ntorus of GL(M ) which normalizes the W (k)-submodule of M generated by ei , \u2200i \u2208\nS(1, dimW (k) (M )), where {e1 , ..., edimW (k) (M ) } is a W (k)-basis of M as in 2.2.1 d). Lie(T )\nis included in F 0 (End(M )) and is normalized by \u03c6; so it has a W (k)-basis formed by\nelements fixed by \u03c6. So the canonical split cocharacter \u03bc : Gm \u2192 GL(M ) of (M, F 1 , \u03c6)\nfactors through T . From the Fact of 2.2.9 1), we get: (M, F 1 , \u03c6, T ) is a Shimura filtered\n\u03c3-crystal.\nIf there is a torus TW (k) of GL(M ) such that (M, F 1 , \u03c6, TW (k) ) is a Shimura filtered\n\u03c3-crystal, then the proof of cyclic diagonalizability of (M, F 1 , \u03c6) is entirely as of 4.1.2\nbelow. In other words, if T is the Zp -structure of TW (k) obtained as in 2.2.9 8), and\nif W (k(v)), with k(v) a finite field, is the smallest Witt subring of W (k) such that the\ncocharacter \u03bc : Gm \u2192 TW (k) (obtained as in c) of 2.2.8 1)) is obtained from one of\nTW (k(v)) by pull back, then we can move from \"the over k\" context to \"the over k(v)\"\ncontext: not to introduce extra notations we assume k = k(v). So we can entirely copy\n(so this is not a forwarding but a convenient replacement) the notations of 4.1.1.1-4 which\npertain just to the quintuple (M, F 1 , \u03c6, T, k(v)) to get as in 4.1.2, that (M, F 1 , \u03c6) is a\ncyclic diagonalizable filtered \u03c3-crystal. The only difference: as we are not necessarily in\na principal quasi-polarized context, the set I\u03c6\u03040 (see 4.1.1.4) can have 1 element as well.\nThis proves the Lemma.\n2.2.16.1. Remark. In practice we take T to be the smallest torus of GL(M ) such\nthat Lie(T ) is normalized by \u03c6 and contains \u03bc(Lie(Gm )), where \u03bc : Gm \u2192 GL(M ) is the\ncanonical split of (M, F 1 , \u03c6).\nFor the case p = 2 of 2.2.16.2-3 below see 2.3.18.2.\n2.2.16.2. A Galois interpretation. We assume p \u2265 3 and k = k\u0304. Let (M, F 1 , \u03c6)\nbe a filtered \u03c3-crystal over k. Let\n\u03c1 : \u0393k \u2192 GL(N )(Zp )\nbe its attached Galois representation, obtained via Fontaine's comparison theory; so N\nis a free Zp -module of rank equal to the rank of M over W (k). We have:\nCorollary. (M, F 1 , \u03c6) is cyclic diagonalizable iff \u03c1 factors through the group of\nZp -valued points of a torus T1 of GL(N ).\nProof: We can assume F 1 is a proper direct summand of M . If (M, F 1 , \u03c6) is cyclic\ndiagonalizable, then let T be a maximal torus of GL(M ) such that (M, F 1 , \u03c6, T ) is a\n116\n\n\fShimura filtered \u03c3-crystal (cf. the proof of 2.2.16). Lie(T ) is generated by elements fixed\nby \u03c6. Any such element can be viewed as an endomorphism of (M, F 1 , \u03c6) and so (cf.\nthe functorial aspect of Fontaine's comparison theory), as an endomorphism of N fixed\nby Im(\u03c1). The Lie subalgebra L of End(N ) generated by such endomorphisms is the\nLie algebra of a maximal torus T1 of GL(N ): this can be seen moving from GL(N ) to\nGL(N \u2297Zp W (k)) and using the fact that Lie(T ) = L \u2297Zp W (k) is generated by projectors\nof M onto W (k)-submodules of M of rank one. As T1 is the centralizer of L in GL(N ),\n\u03c1 factors through the Zp -valued points of T1 .\nThe converse can be proved in entirely the same manner: we can assume T1 is a\nmaximal torus of GL(N ). This proves the Corollary.\n2.2.16.2.1. Remark. Referring to the proof of 2.2.16.2, we have a natural\nidentification of T1W (k) with T : both can be recovered as the invertible elements of\nLie(T ) = L \u2297Zp W (k) (viewed as endomorphisms of M or of N \u2297Zp W (k)).\n2.2.16.3. Corollary. We assume p \u2265 3 and k = k\u0304. If we have a proper direct\nsum decomposition (M, F 1 , \u03c6) = (M1 , F11 , \u03c61 ) \u2295 (M2 , F21 , \u03c62 ), then (M, F 1 , \u03c6) is cyclic\ndiagonalizable iff (M1 , F11 , \u03c61 ) and (M2 , F21 , \u03c62 ) are cyclic diagonalizable.\nProof: This is implied by the Corollary of 2.2.16.2.\n2.2.16.4. Degree of definition. Let (M, F 1 , \u03c6) be a cyclic diagonalizable \u03c3crystal. Let \u03bc : Gm \u2192 GL(M ) be the canonical split cocharacter of it. Let M = F 1 \u2295 F 0\nbe the direct sum decomposition it produces (so \u03b2 \u2208 Gm (W (k)) acts through \u03bc as the\nmultiplication with \u03b2 \u2212i on F i , i = 0, 1, cf. 2.1). Let h be the projector of M on F 1\nassociated to it. Let d \u2208 N be the smallest number such that \u03c6d (h) = h. The existence of\nd can be seen moving to k\u0304 and applying the part of the proof of 2.2.16 referring to k(v):\nfrom very definitions we have d = [k(v) : Fp ]. We refer to d as the degree of definition\nof (M, F 1 , \u03c6). Passing to a perfect field containing k, it remains the same. Let a be the\n\u03c3-linear automorphism of M such that \u03c6 = a \u25e6 \u03bc( p1 ).\nDefinition. (M, F 1 , \u03c6) is called strongly cyclic diagonalizable, if the Zp -submodule\nM of M formed by elements fixed by a, has rank equal to dimW (k) (M ).\na\n\nIt is easy to see that the fact that (M, F 1 , \u03c6) is strongly cyclic diagonalizable implies\nk contains Fpd . Moreover, d has the following (geometric) interpretation.\nFact. We assume k = k\u0304. We have:\na) (M, F 1 , \u03c6) is the extension from Fpd to k of a strongly cyclic diagonalizable filtered\n\u03c3Fpd -crystal;\nb) if (M, F 1 , \u03c6) is the extension from Fpm to k of a strongly cyclic diagonalizable\nfiltered \u03c3Fpm -crystal (M\u0303 , F 1 (M\u0303 ), \u03c6\u0303), then d|m.\nProof: a) is a consequence of the part of 2.2.9 8) referring to the case of a torus\nand of the above interpretations of d in terms of k(v). For b), we first remark that \u03c6\u0303m\nis a W (Fpm )-linear endomorphism of M\u0303 . Let T be as in the proof of 2.2.16 and let L\n117\n\n\fbe as in 2.2.16.2.1; so we identify L with the set of elements of Lie(T ) fixed by \u03c6. But,\ndue to our hypothesis, any e \u2208 L belongs to End(M\u0303 ) and is fixed by the B(Fpm )-valued\npoint of GL(M\u0303 ) defined by \u03c6\u0303m . So \u03c6\u0303m is a B(Fpm )-valued point of the torus of GL(M\u0303 )\nwhose extension to W (k) is T ; so it fixes the image of the canonical split cocharacter of\n(M\u0303 , F 1 (M\u0303 ), \u03c6\u0303). We get: \u03c6m (h) = \u03c6\u0303m (h) = h and so d|m. This ends the proof.\n2.2.16.5. About the (adjoint) Lie case. All the above part of 2.2.16 can be\nadapted to the context of Shimura (adjoint) filtered Lie \u03c3-crystals; the only difference:\nthe restriction p \u2265 3 encountered in 2.2.16.2-3 has to be replaced by the restriction p \u2265 5.\nWe do not present here the details: we just mention some new important features, in the\nlarger context of filtered Lie \u03c3-crystals.\n\u0001\nWe start with a filtered Lie \u03c3-crystal g, \u03c6, F 0 (g), F 1 (g) . We assume p \u2265 5 and\ng 6= {0} but we do not require k to be algebraically closed. Let \u03c1 : \u0393k \u2192 GL(N )(Zp )\nbe its attached Galois representation (cf. [Fa1, 2.6] applied modulo positive, integral\npowers of p). N [ p1 ] (resp. N ) has \u2013via Fontaine's comparison theory\u2013 a natural Lie\nalgebra structure if p \u2265 5 (resp. if p \u2265 7). Let GN be the Zariski closure in GL(N ) of\nthe subgroup of GL(N [ p1 ]) formed by Lie automorphisms of N [ p1 ]. \u03c1 factors through the\ngroup of Zp -valued points of GN . In general the structure of GN can\n\u0001 be very complicated.\n0\n1\nSo for simplicity, in all that follows we assume g, \u03c6, F (g), F (g) is a Shimura adjoint\nfiltered Lie \u03c3-crystal. We have:\nFact. In such a case Lie(GN )[ p1 ] is isomorphic to N [ p1 ] and so is a Qp -form of\ng \u2297W (k) B(k).\nProof: The first (resp. second) part is a consequence of the fact that any semisimple\nLie algebra over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0 has no differentiations\nwhich are not inner, i.e. which are not defined by its elements (resp. of Fontaine's\ncomparison theory).\nIt is worth pointing out: [Va2, 4.3.10 b)] can be used to get criteria when the Zariski\nclosure in GN of the connected component of the origin of the generic fibre of GN is an\nadjoint group over Zp . However, from the point of view of\u0001 cyclic diagonalizability this\nis not relevant: if k = k\u0304 and moreover g, \u03c6, F 0 (g), F 1 (g) is cyclic diagonalizable, we\nconsider the Zariski closure T0 in GN of the connected component of the origin of the\ngeneric fibre of the intersection of GN with some maximal torus T1 of GL(N ); so T0 is\n(for instance, see [Va2, 4.3.9]) a subtorus of T1 and so of GN . Here T1 is obtained as\nin the proof of 2.2.16.2 from a suitable maximal torus T of GL(g); so (cf. the proof of\n2.2.16) T is a maximal torus of GL(g) whose Lie algebra is contained in F 0 (End(g)) and\nis mapped by \u03c6 onto itself.\nWe now assume that k is arbitrary (so p \u2265 2). Let G be the \u0001adjoint group over W (k)\nof whose Lie algebra is g, cf. end of 2.2.13. If g, \u03c6, F 0 (g), F 1 (g) is cyclic diagonalizable,\nwe can work as well the previous paragraph in the crystalline context: we consider the\nZariski closure TG in G of the connected component of the origin of the generic fibre of\nthe intersection of G with T . As above, TG is a torus\nof G; as in the proof of 2.2.16\n\u0001\n0\n1\nwe get that the canonical split of g, \u03c6, F (g), F (g) is a cocharacter of GL(g) factoring\n118\n\n\fthrough TG . So, as in 2.2.16.4, if (g, \u03c6) is non-trivial we define the\n\u0001 degree of definition,\n0\n1\nto be referred as the A-degree of definition, of g, \u03c6, F (g), F (g) .\n\nAlso, the above Fact still holds, provided we just state it rationally from the very\nbeginning, i.e. we work with a Galois Qp -representation \u03c1Qp : \u0393k \u2192 GL(N [ p1 ]) (we do\nassume that such a representation does exist: in most cases pertaining to p|6 this is\nobvious; [CF] and [La, th. 3.2] imply that in fact it always exists provided we define it\nusing the semistable version of Fontaine's ring of W (k)).\n2.2.17. Definitions. Let (M, \u03c6, G) be a Shimura \u03c3-crystal over k. By a lift of it of\nquasi CM type we mean a direct summand (filtration) F 1 of M such that the quadruple\n(M, F 1 , \u03c6, G) is a Shimura filtered \u03c3-crystal with the property that the intersection of\nF 0 (Lie(GB(k) )) with the Lie subalgebra p=0 of Lie(GB(k) ) corresponding to the slope\n0 of (Lie(GB(k) ), \u03c6), contains a Lie subalgebra of a maximal torus of GB(k) which is\nnormalized by \u03c6. We also say: (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G) is a lift of quasi CM type of (M, \u03c6, G).\nBy a lift of an abelian variety Ak over k of quasi CM type we mean an abelian\nvariety A over W (k) lifting Ak and such that the filtered \u03c3-crystal of A is a lift of quasi\nCM type of the \u03c3-crystal of Ak (here we use the identifications of 2.2.9 9)). Above, the\nabbreviation CM refers to complex multiplication.\n2.2.17.1. Remark. A Shimura \u03c3-crystal can have more than one lift of quasi CM\ntype. For instance, this is the case for the \u03c3-crystal of (a product of) supersingular elliptic\ncurves over k\u0304. Instead of slope 21 we can work equally fast and well with any other slope\na\na\nr , with r \u2208 N, r \u2265 2, (a, r) = 1, and with any \u03c3-crystal of rank r and pure slope r and\nwhich has a lift of quasi CM type: we get an infinite number of lifts of quasi CM type.\nThese examples are very simple; but in some sense (see 4.4.13 below) they are typical.\n2.2.18. Proposition. We assume k = k\u0304. Let F 1 be a lift of quasi CM type of a\nShimura \u03c3-crystal (M, \u03c6, G). Then the filtered \u03c3-crystal (M, F 1 , \u03c6) is cyclic diagonalizable.\nProof: Let \u03bc : Gm \u2192 GL(M ) be the canonical split cocharacter of (M, F 1 , \u03c6). From\nits functoriality we deduce (cf. def. 2.2.8 1)) that \u03bc factors through G. We consider (see\n2.2.17) a B(k)-Lie subalgebra LIE of F 0 (Lie(GB(k) )) normalized by \u03c6 and which is the\nLie algebra of a maximal torus TB(k) of GB(k) . All slopes of (LIE, \u03c6) are 0. So, as k = k\u0304,\nwe get: LIE is generated by elements fixed by \u03c6. Again from the functoriality of \u03bc we\n1\nget: \u03bc fixes such elements. So the generic fibre of \u03bc factors through TB(k) . Let TB(k)\nbe\nthe smallest subtorus of TB(k) such that the generic fibre of \u03bc factors through it and its\n1\nLie algebra is normalized by \u03c6. The Zariski closure of TB(k)\nin GL(M ) is a torus T 1 of G:\nit is generated by Gm subgroups of GL(M ), commuting among themselves and obtained\nfrom the image of \u03bc via iterates of \u03c6. So \u03bc factors through T 1 . We get a Shimura filtered\n\u03c3-crystal (M, F 1 , \u03c6, T 1 ) (cf. Fact of 2.2.9 1)). Now everything results from 2.2.16. This\nends the proof.\n2.2.19. Remark. There are plenty of examples of filtered \u03c3-crystals (M, F 1 , \u03c6),\nwith dimW (k) (M ) = 2 dimW (k) (F 1 ), such that the \u03c3-crystal (M, \u03c6) does not have a lift\n119\n\n\fof quasi CM type. The idea of constructing such examples is: if k = k\u0304, then a \u03c3-crystal\n(M, \u03c6) which has a lift of quasi CM type is a direct sum of \u03c3-crystals having only one\nslope (cf. 2.2.1.1 4) and 2.2.18). Moreover, the different invariants (like Hodge numbers,\netc.) of such summands are of particular type, and so very easy computable. So we just\nhave to pass to an adequate isogeny. Here is an example involving slopes having 3 as\ntheir denominators.\nExample 1. Let M be of rank 6 over W (k). Let \u03c6 be such that it sends the elements\nof a W (k)-basis {e1 , ..., e6 } of M into the B(k)-basis {pe2 , pe3 , e1 , pe5 , e6 , e4 } of M [ p1 ], the\nordering being preserved. Let M \u2032 be the W (k)-lattice of M [ p1 ] generated by M and by\ne1 +e4\n. If F 1 :=< e2 , e4 , e3 + e6 >, then the triple (M \u2032 , F 1 , \u03c6) is a filtered \u03c3-crystal; its\np\nslopes are 13 and 23 . From 2.2.1.1 4) and 2.2.18 we deduce C := (M \u2032 , \u03c6) has no lift of\nquasi CM type. Moreover, the \u03c3-crystal C \u2295 C\u2217 (1) has a principal quasi-polarization but\n(the argument is the same; see also 2.2.16.3 and its p = 2 version of 2.3.18.2 below) it\nhas no lift of quasi CM type.\nAlso, it is worth pointing out that the Lie subalgebra of End(M \u2032 ) corresponding to\nthe slope 0 (resp. to positive slopes) of (End(M \u2032 ), \u03c6) is L0 := End(M1 ) \u2295 End(M2 ) (resp.\nis L>0 := Hom(M2 , M1 )), where M1 :=< e1 , e2 , e3 > and M2 :=< e4 , e5 , e6 >. But\nL0 /pL0 and L>0 /pL>0 have a non-zero intersection (inside End(M \u2032 /pM \u2032 )); so L0 is not\nthe Lie algebra of a Levi subgroup of the parabolic subgroup of GL(M \u2032 ) whose generic\nfibre has L0 [ p1 ] \u2295 L>0 [ p1 ] as its Lie algebra. In particular L0 is not the Lie algebra of a\nreductive subgroup of GL(M \u2032 ).\nAlso, we would like to recall (see Example 2 below) that there are filtered \u03c3-crystals\n(M, F 1 , \u03c6), with dimW (k) (M ) = 2 dimW (k) (F 1 ), such that there is a lattice M \u2032 of M [ p1 ]\nwith the property that the pair (M \u2032 , \u03c6) is a \u03c3-crystal which can not be extended to a\nfiltered \u03c3-crystal. So above, we have to be careful in choosing \"adequate isogenies\".\nExample 2. Let M be of rank 4 over W (k). Let \u03c6 be such that it sends the elements\ne0 , e1 , f0 and f1 of a W (k)-basis of M , into pe0 , e1 , pf1 and respectively f0 . Let M \u2032 be\n0\nthe lattice of M [ p1 ] generated by e0 , e1 , e0 +f\nand f1 . The \u03c3-crystal (M \u2032 , \u03c6) can not be\np\nextended to a filtered \u03c3-crystal.\n2.2.19.1. Definition. A Shimura adjoint Lie \u03c3-crystal (g, \u03c6) is said to be of\nreductive type, if W (0)(g, \u03c6) is the Lie algebra of a reductive subgroup of the adjoint\ngroup whose Lie algebra is g.\n2.2.19.2. Exercise. Show that the Shimura adjoint Lie \u03c3-crystal attached to a\nShimura \u03c3-crystal (M, \u03c6, G) having a lift of CM type, is of reductive type. Hint: if\nG = GL(M ), then this follows from 2.2.18, 2.2.16 and 2.2.1.1 4); if G is not GL(M ), use\n2.2.3 3) and a relative argument of passing things from GL(M ) to G.\n2.2.20. Shimura p-divisible groups. Let X be a regular, formally smooth,\nfaithfully flat W\u0303 (k)-scheme, where W\u0303 (k) is a DVR whose completion is W (k). A Shimura\np-divisible group over X is a pair (D, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ) comprising from a p-divisible group D\nover X and a family of sections (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J of the essential tensor algebra of F \u2297Z(p) Q,\n120\n\n\fwhere F is the first crystalline cohomology OX \u2227 -sheaf of D \u00d7 Dt , satisfying the following\naxiom:\nAX. There is an open, affine covering of X, such that for any member U = Spec(R)\n1\nof it whose special fibre is non-empty, denoting MR := Hcrys\n(DU /U \u2227 ), the mentioned\nsections produce sections (we keep the same notation) of T (MR [ p1 ]) satisfying:\ni) they are crystalline sections, i.e. they are annihilated by the natural connection\non MR , are in the F 0 -filtration of T (MR [ p1 ]) defined by the natural F 1 -filtration F 1 (MR )\nof MR , and are fixed by every \u03a6R -linear endomorphism \u03a6MR of MR defined (via DU ) by\nany Frobenius lift \u03a6R of R\u2227 ;\nii) the Zariski closure of the subgroup of GL(MR [ p1 ]) fixing t\u03b1 , \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 J , in GL(MR )\nis a reductive group G\u0303R over R\u2227 ;\niii) F 1 (MR ) is a proper direct summand of MR in each geometric point of the special\nfibre of U .\n2.2.20.1. Remarks. 1) Any p-divisible group whose associated filtered F -crystal\nhas a structure of a Shimura filtered \u03c3-crystal (or of a Shimura filtered F -crystal) with\nan emphasized family of tensors, gets naturally the structure of a Shimura p-divisible\ngroup.\n2) The importance of this notion (of Shimura p-divisible groups) springs from 1.15.1.\nIn \u00a71-4 we need it mostly just to simplify the presentation.\n3) As in 2.2.9 6), we speak about isomorphisms and 1J -isomorphisms between two\nShimura p-divisible groups over the same base X.\n4) Sometimes we need to speak about principally quasi-polarized Shimura p-divisible\ngroups. The extra thing we need for this is: D has a principal quasi-polarization pD ,\nwhich as a perfect form on MR is normalized by G\u0303R , for any U as above. Notation:\n(D, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J , pD ). Moreover we allow 2.2.20 ii) to be modified as in 2.2.9 12).\n5) If X1 is a regular, formally smooth, faithfully flat W\u0303 (k)-scheme, then the pull\nback of a Shimura p-divisible group over X through a W\u0303 (k)-morphism X1 \u2192 X, is also\na Shimura p-divisible group (over X1 ).\n6) Instead of crystalline sections we can use, as a variant, \u00e9tale sections (in the Qp context). But in the case when X is not (the p-adic completion of) a pro-\u00e9tale scheme\nover a smooth W\u0303 (k)-scheme, it is more convenient to work with crystalline sections:\nsee the way [Fa1, 7.1] is stated and proved and see the easiness of expressing an integral\nreductiveness condition in 2.2.20 ii). Moreover, in \u00a75 we define Shimura p-divisible groups\nover larger classes of schemes (including ones of characteristic p) and so often the \u00e9tale\nQp -context is not suited at all.\n7) It is convenient to allow the family of tensors (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J to vary under the constraint\nthat the reductive groups G\u0303R of 2.2.20 ii) remain the same. In other words, by enlarging\nJ or by passing to a subset of J subject to the mentioned constraint we consider that we\nhave essentially the same Shimura p-divisible group. This leads to the notion of quasiisomorphism: two Shimura p-divisible groups over X, E 1 = (D1 , (t1\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J 1 ) and E 2 =\n121\n\n\f \u0303 2\n(D2 , (t2\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J 2 ), are said to be quasi-isomorphic if there is an isomorphism t : D1 \u2192D\nsuch that for any U as in 2.2.20, the reductive group G\u03031R over R\u2227 we get via E 1 is mapped\n1\n(via the isomorphism of Hcrys\n's groups induced by tU ) isomorphically into the reductive\ngroup G\u03032R over R\u2227 we get via E 2 . Similarly for the principally quasi-polarized context.\n8) We would like to point out that the terminologies of Shimura p-divisible groups\nand crystals do not quite match: in 2.2.20 we do not require G\u0303R to become quasi-split\nover geometric points of Spec(R/pR), while in 2.2.8 the accent does not fall on tensors.\nThe reason we adopted these terminologies is of purely practical matters: in the case of\nShimura p-divisible groups we are (besides problems involving classifications, reductions\nand Newton polygons) very much interested in understanding the tensors and the refined\nstructures of the reductive groups (like G\u0303R ) involved, while we mainly use Shimura \u03c3crystals as a tool for accomplishing these goals (see 1.15 for a sample).\nThe condition iii) of 2.2.20 AX is inserted to match 2.2.9 11). The conventions of\n2.2.9 11) extend naturally to the context of Shimura p-divisible groups.\n9) To simplify the notations, we assume W\u0303 (k) = W (k). Let D = (D, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ) be a\nShimura p-divisible group over X. We have:\nFact. If p \u2265 3 or if p = 2 and X \u2227 is equipped with a Frobenius lift (resp. if p = 2\nand X \u2227 is not equipped with a Frobenius lift) then for any n \u2208 N, Dn := D(D[pn ])\n\u2207\n(see 2.2.1.0) is an object of MF[0,1]\n(X) with the property that the Lie object End(Dn )\n\u2207(big\u2212tens)\n\n\u2207\nof MF[\u22121,1]\n(X) (resp. of MF[\u22121,1]\n\n(X)) has a natural Lie subobject g(Dn ): the\n\nunderlying R-module of the pull back of g(Dn ) to U is Lie(G\u0303R ) \u2297R R/pn R.\nProof: We first show that the induced filtration of Lie(G\u0303R ) \u2297R R/pn R is defined by\ndirect summands and Lie(G\u0303R ) \u2297R R/pn R is generated by \u03a6MR (F 0 (Lie(G\u0303R )) \u2297R R/pn R),\n\u03a6MR ( p1 F 1 (Lie(G\u0303R ))\u2297R R/pn R) and p\u03a6MR (Lie(G\u0303R )). This is a local statement and so, by\ncompleting, we can assume R is noetherian. So (by multiplying by some power of p) we\ncan assume t\u03b1 \u2208 T (MR ), \u2200 \u2208 J . This implies that Lie(G\u0303R ) is the kernel of the evaluations\nof endomorphisms of MR at these sections. As End(MR ) is a p-adically complete and\nnoetherian R\u2227 -module, we get that Lie(G\u0303R ) \u2297R R/pn R is the image in End(MR /pn MR )\nof the kernel of the reduction mod pn+m of these evaluations, with m \u2208 N big enough.\nAs these last evaluations can be viewed as morphisms between objects of MF \u2207 (R) (and\nso, by forgetting the connections, of MF (R)), the statement follows from the strictness\npart of [Fa1, 2.1 iii)] (cf. also 2.2.1.1 6)).\nTo end the proof, we just need to add: if p = 2 and X \u2227 is not equipped with\n\u2207\na Frobenius lift, then we are dealing with objects of MF[\u22121,1]\n(U ), with U as in 2.2.20,\n\u2207\nwhich are obtained via a natural process from ones of MF[0,1](X), and so they canonically\nget glued together (cf. also 3) of 2.2.4 C).\nWe refer to the pair\n(Dn , g(Dn ))\n(resp. to g(Dn )) as the crystalline counterpart (resp. as the Lie subobject) of the kernel\n122\n\n\fof the multiplication by pn of D. Similarly, we use the same language in the principally\nquasi-polarized context. We also say: the pair (D(D), (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ) is associated to D.\n2.2.21. A result of Faltings: universal deformations. We consider a Shimura\nfiltered \u03c3-crystal (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ) with an emphasized family of tensors. Let P be\nthe parabolic subgroup of G normalizing F 1 . Let H be a smooth closed subscheme of G\nsuch that we get naturally an open embedding H \u0592\u2192 G/P (for instance, we can take H\nto be a nilpotent subgroup of G). We assume H(W (k)) contains the identity element of\nG(W (k)). Let R and f \u0303 be as in 2.2.10.\nLet D be a p-divisible group over W (k) such that its corresponding filtered \u03c3crystal is (M, F 1 , \u03c6); for p = 2 we assume it exists. We get a Shimura p-divisible group\nD := (D, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ) over Spec(W (k)). There is a uniquely determined Shimura p-divisible\ngroup DR = (DR , (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ) over Spec(R) whose associated filtered F -crystal with ten \u0303 (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ) and whose pull back through the closed embedding\nsors is (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G, H, f,\nz : Spec(W (k)) \u2192 Spec(R) defined by xi 's being made to be 0, is (identifiable with) D\nitself. This is just a restatement of part of [Fa2, th. 10]. In [Fa2, p. 136-7] the uniqueness of DR is stated just in [Fa2, rm i) after th. 10]: however, going through the proof\nof [Fa2, th. 10] we do get the uniqueness part. Also it is worth pointing out that the\nuniqueness part follows as well from previous work: DR/pR is uniquely determined, cf.\n[BM, ch. 4] (or [dJ1, th. of intro.]). But the ideal of p(x1 , ..., xd) of R has nilpotent divided powers modulo any positive, integral power of (x1 , ..., xd). As R is complete w.r.t.\n \u0303 we construct\nthe (x1 , ..., xd)-topology, starting from D, DR/pR and (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G, H, f)\nuniquely DR (see [Me, ch. 4-5]). Moreover, [Fa2, rm. iii) after th. 10] can be restated as\nfollows. We have (cf. also the comments of 2.2.9 1)) the following universal property.\nUP. For any Shimura p-divisible group DR1 over Spec(R1 ) = Spec(W (k))[[y1 , ..., ym]],\nwith m \u2208 N, whose pull back through the closed embedding z1 : Spec(W (k)) \u2192 Spec(R1 )\ndefined by yj 's being made to be 0, is (identifiable with) D, there is a unique W (k)morphism zR : Spec(R1 ) \u2192 Spec(R) such that zR \u25e6z1 = z and we have an 1J -isomorphism\n\u2217\nzR\n(DR )\u2192D\n \u0303 R1 which in z1 achieves (i.e. is compatible with) the mentioned identifications.\nIn loc. cit., the above UP is (implicitly) stated in terms of filtered F -crystals with\ntensors. In what follows we refer to the UP above in both contexts: of Shimura p-divisible\ngroups or of filtered F -crystals with tensors. To DR we refer as a (or as the) universal\nShimura p-divisible group (defined by D); for p \u2265 3 it is uniquely determined by the\nquadruple (M, \u03c6, G, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ) (see 2.3.18 why this is not always so for p = 2). There is\na natural variant of this UP in a principally quasi-polarized context; in particular, we\nspeak about universal principally quasi-polarized Shimura p-divisible groups.\n2.2.21.1. Remark. 2.2.10 and 2.2.21 make sense for the context of not necessarily\nquasi-split Shimura filtered \u03c3-crystals.\n2.2.22. Complements on Shimura (Lie) \u03c3-crystals. Below we deal with four\nsuch complements.\n1) Extra terminology. A Shimura (resp. Shimura filtered) \u03c3-crystal (M, \u03c6, G)\n(resp. (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G)) over k is said to be:\n123\n\n\f\u2013 quasi cyclic diagonalizable, if there is a torus T of G such that (M, \u03c6, T ) (resp.\n(M, F 1 , \u03c6, T )) is a quasi Shimura (resp. quasi Shimura filtered) \u03c3-crystal;\n\u2013 cyclic diagonalizable, if there is a lift F 1 of it such that (resp. if) (M, F 1 , \u03c6) is\ncyclic diagonalizable in the sense of 2.2.1 d);\n\u2013 strongly cyclic diagonalizable, if there is a torus T of G such that (M, \u03c6, T ) (resp.\n(M, F 1 , \u03c6, T )) is a cyclic diagonalizable Shimura (resp. Shimura filtered) \u03c3-crystal and\n(M, F 1 , \u03c6) is strongly cyclic diagonalizable (here, for the non-filtered context, F 1 is the\nunique direct summand of M such that (M, F 1 , \u03c6, T ) is a Shimura filtered \u03c3-crystal, cf.\nCorollary of 2.2.9 3));\n\u2013 potentially cyclic diagonalizable if over k\u0304 it is cyclic diagonalizable.\nWe have:\nFact. For Shimura (filtered) \u03c3-crystals, the cyclic diagonalizability implies the quasi\ncyclic diagonalizability.\nProof: Let (M0 , F01 , \u03c60 , G\u03031 ) be a cyclic diagonalizable Shimura filtered \u03c3-crystal.\nWe use the notations of 2.2.9 1). We can assume \u03c10 is well defined; so G1 contains\nG0 (cf. Fact of 2.2.9 1')). In the first paragraph of the proof of 2.2.16, working with\nan arbitrary k, as the Weyl group of G is finite, the quadruple (M, F 1 , \u03c6, T ) is a quasi\nShimura filtered \u03c3-crystal. So by passing to a finite field extension of k, we can assume we\nhave a Shimura filtered \u03c3-crystal (M0 , F01 , \u03c60 , T1 ) with T1 a maximal torus of GL(M0 ).\nSo the Fact follows from the Fact of 2.2.9 1') applied to the quadruple (M0 , F01 , \u03c60 , T2 ),\nwith T2 as the Zariski closure of the connected component of the origin of the intersection\nT1B(k) \u2229 G\u03031B(k) in G\u03031 (as in 2.2.16.5 we argue T2 is a torus).\nIf k = k\u0304, then the converse holds (cf. 2.2.16); this is not necessarily true if k 6= k\u0304\n(simple examples can be obtained by looking at ordinary elliptic curves over algebraic\nextensions of finite fields).\nIf G = GL(M ), it is easy to see that the above notion of cyclic (resp. strongly cyclic)\ndiagonalizable filtered \u03c3-crystal coincides (via 2.2.9 9)) to the previous one of 2.2.1 d)\n(resp. of Def. of 2.2.16.4). If k = k\u0304, then the cyclic diagonalizability implies the strongly\ncyclic diagonalizability; this is not necessarily true if k 6= k\u0304 (cf. the Fact of 2.2.16.4).\nAs in 2.2.16.4, we speak about the degree of definition of a potentially cyclic diagonalizable filtered \u03c3-crystal; in particular, we speak about the degree of definition of a\npotentially Shimura \u03c3-crystal (M, \u03c6, T ), with T a torus. As any maximal torus of Gad is\nits own centralizer in Gad , from the Fact of 2.2.9 1') we get:\nCriterion. Referring to (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G), we assume there is a maximal torus of Gad\nof whose Lie algebra is contained in F 0 (Lie(Gad )) and is normalized by \u03c6 (resp. and is\nW (k)-generated by elements fixed by \u03c6). Then (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G) is potentially cyclic diagonalizable (resp. there is a maximal torus T of G such that (M, F 1 , \u03c6, T ) is a Shimura\nfiltered \u03c3-crystal).\n124\n\n\fFollowing the above pattern, a Shimura filtered Lie \u03c3-crystal over k is called quasi\n(resp. potentially) cyclic diagonalizable, if its extension to k1 is cyclic diagonalizable,\nwith k1 a finite field extension of k (resp. with k1 = k\u0304).\nLet n \u2208 N. The Shimura filtered \u03c3-crystal (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G) is said to be:\n\u2013 cyclic (resp. quasi, potentially or strongly cyclic) diagonalizable of level n, if there\nis a cyclic (resp. quasi, potentially or strongly cyclic) diagonalizable Shimura filtered\n\u03c3-crystal (M, F 1 , g\u03c6, T ), with g \u2208 G(W (k)) and with T of torus of G, such that the\ntruncations mod pn of (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G) and of (M, F 1 , g\u03c6, G) are isomorphic.\nSimilarly, we speak about Shimura filtered \u03c3-crystals (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ) with an\nemphasized family of tensors which are cyclic (resp. quasi, potentially or strongly cyclic)\ndiagonalizable of level n: above we just need to replace isomorphic by 1J -isomorphic (see\n2.2.9 6)).\nExercise. We assume k = k\u0304. (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G) is cyclic diagonalizable of level n iff all\niterates under \u03c3 of the canonical split (cocharacter of GWn (k) ) of its truncation mod pn\n(see 2.2.14.1) are commuting among themselves. Hint: just interpret 2.2.16 mod pn (it\nis [SGA3, Vol. II, p. 48] which allows us to lift tori of GWn (k) and their cocharacters to\ntori of G and respectively to their cocharacters).\nIf G = GL(M ), it is easy to see that the truncation mod pn of (M, F 1 , \u03c6) is cyclic\ndiagonalizable in the sense of 2.2.1 d) iff (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G) is cyclic diagonalizable of level\nn. Similarly, a Shimura filtered Lie \u03c3-crystal is said to be cyclic (resp. quasi or potentially cyclic) diagonalizable of level n if its truncation mod pn is isomorphic (under\nan isomorphism respecting the Lie structures) to the truncation mod pn of a Shimura\nfiltered Lie \u03c3-crystal which is cyclic (resp. quasi or potentially cyclic) diagonalizable. As\nan application of 2.2.16.5 we have:\nCorollary. We assume k = k\u0304. Then (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G) is cyclic diagonalizable of level\nn iff its attached Shimura adjoint filtered Lie \u03c3-crystal LC is so.\nProof: One implication is easy, as in general, the Shimura adjoint filtered Lie \u03c3crystal attached to a strongly cyclic diagonalizable Shimura filtered \u03c3-crystal is cyclic\ndiagonalizable (see the passage from 4.1.2 to 4.1.4 below). For the other implication, we\njust need to show (cf. the Exercise) that the canonical split cocharacter of the truncation\nmod pn of (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G) is such that its iterates under \u03c3 are commuting with each other.\nBut to check this, it is enough to deal with their images in Gad and so, cf. end of 2.2.13,\nwith their images in GL(Lie(Gad\nWn (k) )). But the fact that these last images are commuting\namong themselves, is implied by the fact that LC is cyclic diagonalizable of level n. This\nends the proof.\nAlso, from Exercise we get: if k = k\u0304, (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G) is cyclic diagonalizable of level n\niff (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G, (t\u03b1)\u03b1\u2208J ) is.\n2) Classes and isogeny classes. Let (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G) be a Shimura filtered \u03c3-crystal.\nBy the class of (M, \u03c6, G) we mean the set Cl(M, \u03c6, G) of isomorphism classes of Shimura\n125\n\n\f\u03c3-crystals of the form (M, g\u03c6, G), with g \u2208 G(W (k)). By the isogeny class of (M, \u03c6, G)\nwe mean the set Iso(M, \u03c6, G) of isomorphism classes of Shimura \u03c3-crystals obtained from\nthe set of Shimura filtered \u03c3-crystals of the form\n(g(M ), g(F 1), \u03c6, G(g)),\nwith g \u2208 G(B(k)) and with G(g) as the Zariski closure of GB(k) in GL(g(M )), by forgetting the filtrations. Obviously G(g) is a reductive group over W (k) isomorphic to G\n(see also the general result of [Ti2, end of 2.5]). For any representative (g(M ), \u03c6, G(g))\nof an isomorphism class of Iso(M, \u03c6, G), we have Iso(g(M ), \u03c6, G) = Iso(M, \u03c6, G). If\nIso(M, \u03c6, G) has only 1 element, we say (M, \u03c6, G) has constant isogeny class. As\n(g(M ), g(F 1), \u03c6, G(g)) is isomorphic to (M, F 1 , g \u22121 \u03c6g, G), and as g \u22121 \u03c6g can be put in\nthe form g1 \u03c6, with g1 \u2208 G(W (k)), Cl(M, \u03c6, G) is a disjoint union of different isogeny\nclasses. We say Iso(M, \u03c6, G) is an isogeny class of Cl(M, \u03c6, G).\nSimilarly, we denote and define the class and the isogeny class of a Shimura (adjoint)\nLie \u03c3-crystal and, even more generally, of a p-divisible object with a reductive structure\nover k.\nIf a property P pertaining to Shimura \u03c3-crystals defining the same class Cl(M, \u03c6, G),\nis enjoyed by any representative of an isomorphism class of an isogeny class of Cl(M, \u03c6, G)\n(resp. of an isomorphism class of Cl(M, \u03c6, G)) once it is enjoyed by a Shimura \u03c3-crystal\n(M1 , \u03c61 , G1 ) defining this isogeny class (resp. defining Cl(M, \u03c6, G)) then we refer to it as\nan isogeny invariant (resp. as a class invariant) property. For instance, the automorphism\nclass of (Lie(G), \u03c6) is a class invariant.\nAll above extend to the context of an emphasized family of tensors (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ; so\nwe speak about Cl(M, \u03c6, G, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ) (its elements are isomorphism classes up to 1J isomorphisms) and Iso(M, \u03c6, G, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ), etc.\nDefinition. A class of Shimura adjoint Lie \u03c3-crystals is said to be torsionless, if any\nShimura adjoint Lie \u03c3-crystal defining it has no automorphism of order p.\nFor instance, if p does not divide t(Gad ) then the Shimura adjoint Lie \u03c3-crystal associated to (M, \u03c6, G) has no inner automorphisms of order p. In \u00a713 we will see that there\nare examples (involving An Lie types) with k = k\u0304, when p|t(Gad ) and still Cl(Lie(Gad ), \u03c6)\nis torsionless.\n3) Classification. Any isocrystal over k\u0304 can be put in a cyclic diagonalizable form,\ncf. Dieudonn\u00e9's classification of isocrystals over k\u0304. So the simplest type of \u03c3-crystals over\nk are those which can be put similarly in a cyclic diagonalizable form. Though def. 2.2.1\nd) has a general form, for simplicity, in what follows we mostly focus our attention on\nfiltered \u03c3-crystals (see the conventions of 2.1). However, see L and 3.15.7 A below.\nA. Let n \u2208 N and let In := S(1, n). Till J below we consider only n-tuples\n(e1 , e2 , ..., en) with ei \u2208 {0, 1}, \u2200i \u2208 In . We are interested in them (cf. 2.1) only from the\ncircular point of view: for us (e1 , ..., en) is \"equally good\" as (ej , ej+1 , ..., en, e1 , ..., ej\u22121 ),\nwhere j \u2208 S(2, n). By the dual of such an n-tuple (e1 , e2 , ..., en) we mean the n-tuple\n(1 \u2212 e1 , 1 \u2212 e2 , ..., 1 \u2212 en ).\n126\n\n\fAn n-tuple (e1 , ..., en) is said to be in the standard form if\n(1)\n\nn\nX\ni=1\n\nei 2\n\nn\u2212i\n\n\u2265\n\nn\nX\n\ndi 2n\u2212i ,\n\ni=1\n\nfor any other n-tuple of the form (d1 , ..., dn) = (ej , ..., en, e1 , ..., ej\u22121 ), for some j \u2208 S(2, n).\nWe denote by (e\u22171 , ..., e\u2217n) the n-tuple which is in the standard form, and which is obtained\n\u2217\n\u2217\nfrom the dual of (e1 , ..., en) via a circular rearranging. If (e1 , ..., en) = (eP\n1 , ..., en ) then we\nsay (e1 , ..., en) is self dual. If (e1 , ..., en) is self dual then n is even and i\u2208In ei = n2 .\n\nB. In what follows (cf. 2.1) the right lower indices of entries of an n-tuple are\nconsidered mod n. So e1 = en+1 , etc. For any n-tuple (e1 , ..., en) which is in the standard\nform we can construct a circular diagonalizable filtered \u03c3-crystal (M, F 1 , \u03c6) as follows.\nConstruction. M is a free W (k)-module of rank n, \u03c6(ai ) = pei ai+1 , where {ai |i \u2208\nIn } is a W (k)-basis of M , while F 1 is the W (k)-submodule of M generated by all ai 's\nwith ei = 1.\nAbout (M, F 1 , \u03c6) we say: it is in the standard form associated to (e1 , ..., en) or that\nit has type (e1 , ..., en); about (e1 , ..., en) we say: it is a type of (M, F 1 , \u03c6). From the\nvery def. 2.2.1 d) we get: any filtered \u03c3-crystal which is cyclic diagonalizable is a direct\nsum of circular diagonalizable ones; moreover, any filtered \u03c3-crystal which is circular\ndiagonalizable has a type.\nWe say (e1 , ..., en ) is indecomposable if the extension of (M, F 1 , \u03c6) to k\u0304 does not\nhave a proper direct summand. Otherwise we say (e1 , ..., en) is decomposable. Warning:\nsome of the types can be decomposed; example: the type (1, 0, 1, 0) \"corresponds\" (over\nk\u0304) to a \"direct sum\" of two copies of the type (1, 0).\nC. Proposition. Any circular diagonalizable filtered \u03c3-crystals has a unique type.\n\nProof: Let (e1 , ..., en) and (d1 , ..., dn) be two n-tuples in the standard form. If\n(e1 , ..., en) = (0, ..., 0) then the statement is trivial. So we can assume e1 = 1. Let\n(M1 , F11 , \u03c61 ) and (M2 , F21 , \u03c62 ) be respectively the circular diagonalizable filtered \u03c3crystals having these types. We can assume that inequality (1) above holds. We assume\nthe existence of an isomorphism\n1\nf : (M1 , F11 , \u03c61 )\u2192(M\n \u0303\n2 , F2 , \u03c62 ).\n\nWe use a W (k)-basis {a1 , ..., an} of M1 as above,\nPnas well as a similarly constructed\nW (k)-basis {b1 , ..., bn} of M2 . We write f (a1 ) = i=1 \u03b1i bi , with \u03b1i \u2208 W (k), \u2200i \u2208 In .\nLet j \u2208 In be such that \u03b1j is non-zero mod p. In what follows we do not need that\nf is an isomorphism: we just need that it is a morphism and that such a j does exist.\nBy induction on l \u2208 In we prove that (e1 , ..., el) = (dj , ..., dj+l\u22121 ); due to (1) and the\nstandard forms of (e1 , ..., en) and (d1 , ..., dn), this implies (e1 , ..., en) = (d1 , ..., dn).\nAs \u03c61 (a1 ) = pa2 and f is a morphism, we get dj = 1; so the case l P\n= 1 holds. Let now\nn\nl \u2265 2. We assume (e1 , ..., el\u22121 ) = (dj , ...dj+l\u22122 ). This implies f (al ) = i=1 \u03b1i,l\u22121 bi , with\n127\n\n\f\u03b1j+l\u22121,l\u22121 non-zero mod p (here \u03b1i,l\u22121 \u2208 W (k), \u2200i \u2208 In ). So if el = 1, then dj+l\u22121 must\nbe also 1. If el = 0 and dj+l\u22121 = 1, then we reach a contradiction with the inequality\n(1). So we have el = dj+l\u22121 . This ends the inductive argument and so the proof.\nFrom now on till the end of I below we assume k = k\u0304; however, part of the arguments\nbelow (like the one of the below Corollary) just require that k contains a \"sufficiently\nbig\" finite field.\nCorollary. (M, F 1 , \u03c6) has a principal quasi-polarization iff (e1 , ..., en) is self dual.\nProof: Let C := (M, F 1 , \u03c6). Then C\u2217 (1) is in the standard form associated to\n(e\u22171 , ..., e\u2217n). So if we have an isomorphism C\u2192C\n \u0303 \u2217 (1), then (cf. Proposition) (e1 , ..., en) is\nself dual.\nIf (e1 , ..., en) is self dual, then C and C\u2217 (1) are isomorphic. Let {a1 , ..., an} be a W (k)basis of M as above. Let {a\u22171 , ..., a\u2217n} be the dual W (k)-basis of M \u2217 . The underlying W (k)module of C\u2217 (1) is M \u2217 and the Frobenius endomorphism of it takes a\u2217i into p1\u2212ei a\u2217i+1 .\nLet h \u2208 In be such that (e\u22171 , ..., e\u2217n) = (1 \u2212 eh , 1 \u2212 eh+1 , ..., 1 \u2212 en , 1 \u2212 e1 , ..., 1 \u2212 eh\u22121 ). We\ntake the smallest such h. We have ei + ei+h\u22121 = 1, \u2200i \u2208 N. So ei = ei+2h\u22122 , \u2200i \u2208 N. Let\nd = (2h \u2212 2, n). As n is even, so d is. We get ei = ei+d , \u2200i \u2208 N. As h was taken to be the\nsmallest possible value and as d can not be h \u2212 1, we conclude d = 2h \u2212 2. So 2h \u2212 2|n.\nLet m \u2208 N be such that n = m(2h \u2212 2).\nIf m is odd, we consider an isomorphism iC : C\u2192C\n \u0303 \u2217 (1) that takes a1 into ua\u22171+ n ,\n2\nn\nwith u \u2208 Gm (W (k)) such that \u03c3 2 (u) = \u2212u. It is easy to see that starting from iC we\nget a perfect alternating form \u03c8 : M \u2297W (k) M \u2192 W (k)(1).\nn\n\nIf m is even then 4|n. Accordingly, for j \u2208 {1, 2}, let ej1 := \u03c3 2 (vj )e1 + vj e1+ n2 , with\nn\nvj \u2208 Gm (W (k)) such that \u03c3 n (vj ) = vj , and v1 v2\u22121 mod p is not fixed by \u03c3 2 . We get\na direct sum decomposition (M, F 1 , \u03c6) = (M1 , F11 , \u03c6) \u2295 (M2 , F21 , \u03c6), such that ej1 \u2208 Mj .\nThe type of (Mj , Fj1 , \u03c6) computed starting from ej1 is an n2 -tuple which is also self dual.\nSo we can apply induction (the case n = 2 is well known). This proves the Corollary.\nD. The uniqueness property. We assume now p \u2265 3 (see 2.3.18.2 below for\nthe case p = 2). From very definitions, any cyclic diagonalizable filtered \u03c3-crystal is\na direct sum of circular diagonalizable filtered \u03c3-crystals which have (cf. 2.2.16.3) an\nindecomposable type. Moreover we have:\nProposition. Such a decomposition is unique up to isomorphisms.\nProof: We start with a cyclic diagonalizable filtered \u03c3-crystal (M, F 1 , \u03c6). We can\nassume it has a unique slope \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1]. Moreover, we can assume \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1): otherwise\nthe uniqueness part is trivial. This implies F 1 is a proper summand of M . Let T be a\ntorus of GL(M ) obtained as in 2.2.16.1. Let \u03c1 and N be as in 2.2.16.2. Let T0 be the\ntorus of GL(N ) corresponding to T via Fontaine's comparison theory. \u03c1 factors through\nthe Zp -valued points of T0 and in fact, due to the smallness property expressed in 2.2.16.1,\nT0 is the algebraic envelope of \u03c1. So to decompose (M, F 1 , \u03c6) into direct summands is\nthe same as to decompose N into direct summands normalized by T0 . Based on 2.2.16.2,\n128\n\n\fthe Proposition is equivalent to: N can be decomposed uniquely (up to isomorphism)\ninto a direct sum of indecomposable T0 -subrepresentations. But this is a consequence of\nthe following two well known facts:\n\u2013 the representation of T0Fp on N/pN is semisimple;\n\u2013 any subrepresentation of the representation of T0Fp on N/pN lifts to a subrepresentation of the representation of T0 on N defined by a direct summand of N .\nThis proves the Proposition.\nAs in the above proof, the torus T0 does not depend on which algebraically closed\nfield k we use to define it, we get: the notion of indecomposable type is well defined,\nwithout specifying such a field.\nLet Tn be the set of indecomposable n-tuples (e1 , ..., en) which are in the standard\nform. Let\nT\u221e := \u222a\u221e\nn=1 Tn .\nThe above Proposition says that to any cyclic diagonalizable filtered \u03c3-crystal (M, F 1 , \u03c6),\nwith M 6= {0}, we can associate uniquely a formal sum\nX\nm(\u03c4 )\u03c4,\n\u03c4 \u2208T\u221e\n\nwhere m(\u03c4 ) \u2208 N \u222a {0} is the number of distinct factors having type \u03c4 in a direct sum\ndecomposition of (M, F 1 , \u03c6) in circular diagonalizable filtered \u03c3-crystals which have an\nindecomposable type. For all but finite m(\u03c4 ) = 0; moreover, at least 1 number m(\u03c4 ) is\nnon-zero. From the Corollary of C we get:\nCorollary. (M, F 1 , \u03c6) has a principal quasi-polarization iff m(\u03c4 ) = m(\u03c4 \u2217 ), \u2200\u03c4 \u2208\nT\u221e .\nE. Examples. We come back to p \u2265 2.\na) The quadruples (1, 1, 0, 0) and (1, 0, 1, 0) are producing (under the construction of\nB) non-isomorphic filtered \u03c3-crystals, cf. C. Another way to see this: the Hodge numbers\nof their resulting \u03c3 2 -crystals are not the same. Also the degree of definition of a cyclic\ndiagonalizable filtered \u03c3-crystal having type (1, 1, 0, 0) (resp. (1, 0, 1, 0)) is 4 (resp. 2),\ncf. def. 2.2.16.4.\nb) There are precisely 10 isomorphism classes of cyclic diagonalizable filtered \u03c3crystals (M, F 1 , \u03c6), with M of rank 6, whose isocrystals are 21 -symmetric. Four of them\ndo involve the slopes 0 and 1, one involves the slopes 31 and 32 , while the other five\nare involving just the slope 12 . Among these 5, only 3 of them have principal quasipolarizations: the types (1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0) and (1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0) are dual to each other and so\nare not self dual; so the cyclic diagonalizable filtered \u03c3-crystals having any one of these\ntwo types do not have principal quasi-polarizations (cf. the Corollary of C or of D). So\namong these 10 classes, only 8 are principally quasi-polarizable.\nP\nc) An n-tuple (e1 , ..., en) such that (n, i\u2208In ei ) = 1 is indecomposable.\n129\n\n\fF. Corollary. We assume p \u2265 3. The degree of definition of a cyclic diagonalizable\nfiltered \u03c3-crystal is equal to the least common multiple of the ranks of the circular filtered\n\u03c3-crystals which are direct summands of it and have an indecomposable type.\nProof: We just have to show (cf. D) that if (e1 , ..., en) is an indecomposable type,\nthen the cyclic diagonalizable filtered \u03c3-crystal (M, F 1 , \u03c6) constructed in B, has n as\nits degree of definition. To see this, we can assume k = F. Obviously, the degree of\ndefinition d of (M, F 1 , \u03c6) is a divisor of n. The fact that it is precisely n can be read\nout from 4.1.1.4 below: as (e1 , ..., en ) is indecomposable, the permutation \u03c6\u0304 (constructed\nas in 4.1.1.4) is a cycle of some length dl , and the W (Fpdl )-module p Ff \u0304l (constructed as\nin 4.1.1.4) has rank 1. So M has rank dl . As dl |d (see 4.1.1.4), the conclusion follows.\nWarning: 4.1.1.4 can be read independently at any time, by just picking up the definition\nof h\u0304i 's in 4.1.1.1 below.\nG. Let p \u2265 2. We consider an n-tuple (e1 , ..., en ) in the standard form. Let\n(M, F 1 , \u03c6) be the circular diagonalizable filtered \u03c3-crystal constructed in B. From the\nproof of 2.2.16 and from Corollary of 2.2.9 3), we deduce that the canonical split cocharacter \u03bc : Gm \u2192 GL(M ) of it, is such that \u03b2 \u2208 Gm (W (k)) acts through \u03bc trivially on\nall those ai 's for which ei = 0. So, from the very def. 2.2.16.4, we get: the degree of\ndefinition of (M, F 1 , \u03c6) is equal to the smallest number h \u2208 In such that ei = ei+h ,\n\u2200i \u2208 In . We have:\nCorollary. We assume p \u2265 3. A type (e1 , ..., en) is indecomposable iff the circular\ndiagonalizable filtered \u03c3-crystal having type (e1 , ..., en), has n as its degree of definition.\nProof: One implication follows from F. We assume now that the degree of definition\nis n. We can assume e1 = 1. We assume we have a direct sum decomposition (M, F 1 , \u03c6) =\n(M1 , F11 , \u03c61 ) \u2295(M2 , F21 , \u03c62 ), with M1 and M2 as proper W (k)-submodules of M and with\n(M1 , F11 , \u03c61 ) an indecomposable cyclic diagonalizable filtered \u03c3-crystal. Let (d1 , ..., dm)\nbe its type. Its degree of definition is m and divides n. Let ds+ml := ds , where l \u2208\nn\n\u2212 1) and s \u2208 S(1, m). We get an n-tuple (d1 , ..., dn). If inequality (1) of A\nS(1, m\nholds, then following the first proof of C in the context of the projection of (M, F 1 , \u03c6)\non (M1 , F11 , \u03c61 ) we get that (e1 , ..., en) = (d1 , ..., dn). This contradicts the fact that\nthe degree of definition\nof (M,P\nF 1 , \u03c6) is n. If the inequality (1) does not hold, then\nPn\nn\nn\u2212i\nwe can assume i=1 di 2\n> i=1 ei 2n\u2212i . Using the monomorphism (M1 , F11 , \u03c61 ) \u0592\u2192\n(M, F 1 , \u03c6), we similarly reach a contradiction. This ends the proof.\nFor the case p = 2 of Corollaries of paragraphs F and G see 2.3.18.2.\nH. Combinatorics. There are many problems of combinatorial nature involving\ncyclic diagonalizable filtered \u03c3-crystals. Usually such problems are either very elementary\nor too hard. In what follows, just to point out the flavor of the problems, we mention\njust two such problems of elementary nature.\nFrom G above we get: the number n |Tn | can be interpreted as the number of functions Z/nZ \u2192 {0, 1} which are not periodic. So we have the following recursive formula\n130\n\n\fcomputing the number of elements of Tn :\nX\n\nq |Tq | = 2n .\n\nq|n,q\u2208N\n\nIn particular, |T1 | = 2, |T4 | = 3, |T6 | = 9 and, for q a prime, |Tq | =\n\n2q \u22122\nq .\n\nThe number of isomorphism classes of filtered \u03c3-crystals (M, F 1 , \u03c6), with M of\nrank 2n, which are cyclic diagonalizable and have a principal quasi-polarization, is 2n .\nWe do not explain this fact here; we just mention that this number 2n can be easily\nobtained by combining [Oo3] and 4.12.4 below (see \u00a79-10 for details). This second problem\nis a particular case (corresponding to GM = GSp(M, \u03c8M ), for some principal quasipolarization \u03c8M : M \u2297W (k) M \u2192 W (k)(1)) of the first of the following two general\nproblems (to be analyzed in \u00a79-10).\nProblem 1. Let (M, F 1 , \u03c6, GM ) be a Shimura filtered \u03c3-crystal. Find the number\nof isomorphism classes of cyclic diagonalizable filtered \u03c3-crystals of the form (M, F 1 , g\u03c6),\nwith g \u2208 GM (W (k)).\nProblem 2. Find the set SDD(M, \u03c6, GM ) of degrees of definitions of the cyclic\ndiagonalizable filtered \u03c3-crystals of the form (M, F 1 , g\u03c6), with g \u2208 GM (W (k)).\nExample. If GM = GSp(M, \u03c8M ), then SSD(M, F 1 , GM ) is the set\n{l.c.m.[ba1, ..., bam]|m \u2208 N, b \u2208 {1, 2} and a1 , ..., am \u2208 N, with 2\n\nm\nX\n\naj = dimW (k) (M )}.\n\nj=1\n\nThis is a consequence of the Corollaries of D and F (for p = 2 cf. also 2.3.18.2 below).\nI. Classification and standard invariants. Let m \u2208 N and let q \u2208 N \u222a \u221e.\nLet s := (d1 , ..., dm) be an arbitrary m-tuple, not necessarily in the standard form. We\nassume p \u2265 3 (see 2.3.18.2 for p = 2). Let (M, F 1 , \u03c6) and m(\u03c4 )'s be as in D. We refer to\nm(\u03c4 )'s as the classification invariants. From them we can obtain many other invariants.\nThe number\nF L(M, F 1 , \u03c6) :=\n\nX\n\nm(\u03c4 )\n\n\u03c4 \u2208T\u221e\n\nis referred as the factor length of (M, F 1 , \u03c6). The maximum IL(M, F 1 , \u03c6) of the numbers\nm(\u03c4 )'s is referred as the isotype length of (M, F 1 , \u03c6). The number SKL(M, F 1 , \u03c6) of\nnon-zero m(\u03c4 )'s, is referred as the skeleton length of (M, F 1 , \u03c6). The greatest (resp. the\nnumber of) n \u2208 N such that there is \u03c4 \u2208 Tn with m(\u03c4 ) 6= 0, is referred as the cyclic length\n(resp. the slope denominator length) of (M, F 1 , \u03c6) and is denoted by CL(M, F 1 , \u03c6) (resp.\nby SDL(M, F 1 , \u03c6)). These five types of length, together with the degree of definition of\n(M, F 1 , \u03c6) (i.e. the least common multiple of all such n's), are the most useful simple\ntypes of invariants of (M, F 1 , \u03c6).\n131\n\n\fFor any n \u2208 N and for every \u03c40 := (e1 , ..., en ) \u2208 Tn , let s(\u03c40 ) be the number of i \u2208 In\nsuch that ei+j = dj , for j = 1, m. By the sq -invariant of (M, F 1 , \u03c6) we mean the number\n1\n\nsq (M, F , \u03c6) :=\n\nq X\nX\n\nm(\u03c4 )s(\u03c4 ).\n\nn=1 \u03c4 \u2208Tn\n\nWhen q = \u221e, we drop it as a right lower index of s.\nMany of these invariants have geometric interpretation (see \u00a79-10 for plenty of examples). Here we just point out that: if s = (1) then s(M, F 1 , \u03c6) = dimW (k) (F 1 ), if\ns = (0) then s1 (M, F 1 , \u03c6) is the p-rank of (M, \u03c6), and if s = (1, 0) or if s = (0, 1) then\ns(M, F 1 , \u03c6) computes the a-number of the p-divisible group over k of whose associated\n\u03c3-crystal is (M, \u03c6).\nJ. The adjoint Lie case. Parts A to D above can be adapted to some extend to\nthe case of Shimura adjoint filtered Lie \u03c3-crystals which are cyclic diagonalizable. There\nare two main new features. First, we have to consider n-tuples whose entries are elements\nof the set {\u22121, 0, 1}. Second, except for the trivial context (of 2.2.11 3)) we are never in\na circular context (this can be checked starting from the part of 2.2.16.5 referring to TG ).\nSo, starting from such an n-tuple, we can imitate the construction of B, to get a p-divisible\nobject of MF[\u22121,1] (W (k)); but it is not at all clear how to put some Lie structure on it.\nSo in what concerns B to D, it is more appropriate to concentrate on analyzing particular\ncases showing up in geometric situations, rather than trying to present a whole general\ntheory. Another approach: we totally forget the adjoint Lie structure and proceed as in\nL below.\nK. Variant mod pm . Let m \u2208 N. All of A to J above makes sense and remains\ntrue modulo pm , i.e. for truncations mod pm of cyclic diagonalizable filtered \u03c3-crystals;\nno modifications of arguments are needed (besides using \u2013see 2.2.1 c)\u2013 \u03c60 and \u03c61 instead\nof \u03c6).\nL. Extensions. The arguments of A to I and of K above are such that the motivated\nreader can easily extend them to the context of cyclic diagonalizable p-divisible objects\nof MF[0,m] (W (k)); the only modifications needed to be performed are as follows:\ni) the role of 2 in A is just of a positive integer greater than m;\nii) the dual of an n-tuple (e1 , ...en ) formed by elements of S(0, m), is defined to be\nthe n-tuple (m \u2212 e1 , ..., m \u2212 en );\niii) in the Corollaries of C and E above, we have to situate ourselves in the self dual\ncontext of 2.2.23 d) below;\niv) in paragraphs D, F and G we need p \u2265 m + 2 (this can still be weaken, as their\nreferences to 2.3.18.2 for p = 2 point out; see 2.3.18.3 below);\nv) in H above, 2n has to be replaced by (m + 1)n .\nRelated to iv) we could add that 2.2.16-19 have analogues in the context of p-divisible\nobjects MF[0,m](W (k)) (for p \u2265 m + 2 no modifications of arguments are needed, just of\nlanguage).\n132\n\n\fM. The non-filtered context. In the first proof of C, the fact that f (F11 ) = F21\nplayed no role. So starting from this one can check that all invariants of (M, F 1 , \u03c6)\ndefined in I above are in fact invariants of (M, \u03c6) itself (in other words, if k = k\u0304 and\nif (M, F11 , \u03c6) and (M, F 1 , \u03c6) are both cyclic diagonalizable filtered \u03c3-crystals, then they\nare isomorphic). More generally, we have:\nCorollary. We assume k = k\u0304. Any object (N, \u03c6N ) of p \u2212 M(W (k)) which is\nobtained from a cyclic diagonalizable object of p \u2212 MF (W (k)) by forgetting the filtration,\nis uniquely decomposed (up to isomorphism) as a direct sum of objects of p \u2212 M(W (k))\nwhich are obtained from circular diagonalizable objects of p \u2212 MF (W (k)) by forgetting\nthe filtrations and which can not be decomposed further on in non-trivial direct summands\nhaving this property.\nProof: We just need to show the uniqueness part. Let\n2\n\n1\n\n(N, \u03c6N ) = \u2295ni=1 (Ni1 , \u03c6Ni1 ) = \u2295ni=1 (Ni2 , \u03c6Ni2 )\nbe two such maximal decompositions; so each (Nij , \u03c6N j ) is obtained from a circular\ni\ndiagonalizable object Cij of p \u2212 MF (W (k)) by forgetting the filtration and can not be\ndecomposed into non-trivial direct summands which are obtainable in the same way,\nj = 1, 2, i \u2208 S(1, nj ), with n1 , n2 \u2208 N. Let \u03c4ij = (eji (1), ..., eji (aji )) be the type (defined as\nin A and B) of Cij , with aji \u2208 N. We can assume all entries of \u03c4ij 's are non-negative; let a\n(resp. b) be the least common multiple (resp. the greatest) of aji 's, j = 1, 2, i \u2208 S(1, nj ).\nThe essence of the argument is the proof of G. So let \u03c4ij (ext) be the a-tuple obtained by\nputting aaj -copies of \u03c4ij together. We are interested in them from the circular point of\ni\n\nview and we order them w.r.t. base b + 1 (in a way similar to inequality (1) of A involving\nbase 2); let \u03c4ij00 = (e1 , ..., ea ) be the greatest a-type among \u03c4ij (ext)'s w.r.t. this ordering.\nWe can assume j0 = 1. We proceed by induction on d := dimW (k) (N ); so we assume that\nthe Corollary holds for d smaller than some r \u2208 N. We now prove it for d = r.\nFollowing the proof of G (and so the first proof of C) we get that \u03c4i10 (ext) = \u03c4i21 (ext),\nfor some i1 \u2208 S(1, n2 ), and that Ni10 projects surjectively onto Ni21 ; here we do need to\nuse the fact that a1i0 is the smallest number h \u2208 N such that ei = ei+h , \u2200i \u2208 S(1, a)\n(if it would not be, then using similar arguments as the ones of the last paragraph of\nC we reach a contradiction to the \"indecomposition\" of (Ni10 , \u03c6Ni1 )). This implies: we\n0\n\ncan assume that Ni10 = Ni21 . By passing to quotients (defined by N/Ni10 ) and using the\ninductive assumption, the Corollary follows.\nWarning: the above proof does not apply to get an analogue of 2.2.16.3 in the context\nof MF (W (k)).\nN. Exercise. Show that the converse of 2.2.19.2 does not hold in general. Hint:\nfirst use the types (1, 0) and (1, 1, 0, 0) in the same way as in Example 1 of 2.2.19 and\nthen use the non-filtered version of the proof of G, to argue that we do not get something\nwhich is cyclic diagonalizable.\n133\n\n\f4) The deformation dimension. By the deformation dimension of the Shimura\n\u03c3-crystal (M, \u03c6, G) we mean the number\ndd((M, \u03c6, G)) := dimW (k) (Lie(G)/F 0 (Lie(G))) = dimW (k) (F 1 (Lie(G))).\nHere F 0 (Lie(G)) and F 1 (Lie(G)) are defined as in 2.2.8 1) starting from any (it does not\nmatter which one, cf. Fact 1 of 2.2.9 3)) lift F 1 of (M, \u03c6, G).\n2.2.22.1. a-invariants. Let n \u2208 N. For any n-tuple \u03c4 = (e1 , ..., en) of integers we\ndenote by a+ (\u03c4 ) (resp. by a\u2212 (\u03c4 )) the number of j \u2208 S(1, n) such that (0, 1) = (ej , ej+1 )\n(resp. such that (1, 0) = (ej , ej+1 )). We refer to it as the a+ -invariant (resp. as the\na\u2212 -invariant) of \u03c4 . The number\na(\u03c4 ) :=\n\na+ (\u03c4 ) + a\u2212 (\u03c4 ) 1\n\u2208 Z\n2\n2\n\nis referred as the a-invariant of \u03c4 .\nWe assume k = k\u0304. For any cyclic diagonalizable p-divisible object C of MF (W (k))\n(and so implicitly for the object of p \u2212 M(W (k)) obtained from it by forgetting its\nfiltration) we define its a+ -invariant (resp. the a\u2212 -invariant and the a-invariant) by the\nfollowing two rules (cf. Corollary of M of 2.2.22 3)):\na) they are additive with respect to direct sum decompositions;\nb) if C is circular and is not decomposable as a direct sum of two cyclic diagonalizable\np-divisible objects of MF (W (k)), then it is the a+ -invariant (resp. the a\u2212 -invariant\nand the a-invariant) of the type (it is defined as in A and B of 2.2.22 3)) of C.\nExercise. Show that the a-invariant of a cyclic diagonalizable Shimura \u03c3-crystal\n(M, \u03c6, GL(M )) is the same as the a-number of the p-divisible group whose associated\n\u03c3-crystal is (M, \u03c6).\nIf k 6= k\u0304, by the a+ -invariant (or the a\u2212 -invariant or the a-invariant) of any potentially cyclic diagonalizable Shimura (filtered) adjoint Lie \u03c3-crystal we mean the a+ invariant (or the a\u2212 -invariant or the a-invariant) of its extension to k\u0304. It is easy to see\nthat, under field extensions, all these invariants are the same.\nExample. Let (M, F 1 , \u03c6) be a cyclic diagonalizable filtered \u03c3-crystal. We use the\nnotations of 2.2.1 d), with all n(i)'s belonging to {0, 1}. Let b1 (resp. b2 , b3 and b4 ) be\nthe number of i \u2208 A such that (n(i), n(\u03c0(i)) is (0, 0) (resp. is (0, 1), (1, 0) and (1, 1)). We\nhave:\ni) a1 := b2 = b3 is the a-invariant of (M, \u03c6);\nii) b1 + b4 = dimW (k) (M ) \u2212 2a1 ;\n\u2212\niii) the a+ -invariant (resp. the a\u2212 -invariant) a+\n2 (resp. a2 ) of (End(M ), \u03c6) is b1 b2 +\n+\n\u2212\nb3 b4 (resp. is b1 b3 + b2 b4 ) and so a2 = a2 ;\niv) the a-invariant a2 of (End(M ), \u03c6) is a1 dimW (k) (M ) \u2212 2a21 .\n\n134\n\n\fSo fixing the rank of M , a2 is determined by a1 . Moreover: knowing a2 , we have at\nmost two choices for a1 .\n2.2.23. Complements on quasi-polarizations. In what follows we generalize\nthe notion of principal quasi-polarization introduced in 2.2.1 c). Let n \u2208 N. Let R be\na regular, formally smooth W (k)-algebra. Let \u03a6R be a Frobenius lift of R\u2227 . Let C :=\n(M, (F i (M ))i\u2208S(a,b), \u03c6) (resp. C := (M, (F i (M ))i\u2208S(a,b), (\u03c6i )i\u2208S(a,b) )) be a p-divisible\nobject (resp. an object) of MF[a,b] (R), whose underlying module M is a projective\nR\u2227 -module (resp. projective R/pn R-module).\nA. Definitions. a) C is said to be a symmetric p-divisible object (resp. object) if\nthere is a morphism C \u2297R\u2227 C \u2192 R\u2227 (a + b) (resp. C \u2297R/pn R C \u2192 R/pn R(a + b)) defined (at\nthe level of underlying modules) by a perfect symmetric form pM : M \u2297R\u2227 M \u2192 R\u2227 (resp.\npM : M \u2297R/pn R M \u2192 R/pn R). pM is referred as a symmetric principal quasi-polarization\nof C.\nb) C is said to be an alternating p-divisible object (resp. object) if there is a morphism\nC \u2297R\u2227 C \u2192 R\u2227 (a + b) (resp. C \u2297R/pn R C \u2192 R/pn R(a + b)) defined (at the level of\nunderlying modules) by a perfect alternating form pM : M \u2297R\u2227 M \u2192 R\u2227 (resp. pM :\nM \u2297R/pn R M \u2192 R/pn R). pM is referred as an alternating principal quasi-polarization\nor just as a principal quasi-polarization of C.\nc) If M is a projective R\u2227 -module, then any morphism C \u2297R\u2227 C \u2192 R\u2227 (a + b) defined\nby a symmetric form pM : M \u2297R\u2227 M \u2192 R\u2227 which becomes perfect after inverting p,\nis called a symmetric quasi-polarization of C. As in b) above, we have a variant where\nsymmetric is replaced by alternating.\nd) C is said to be a self dual p-divisible object (resp. object) if there is a morphism\nC \u2297R\u2227 C \u2192 R\u2227 (a + b) (resp. C \u2297R/pn R C \u2192 R/pn R(a + b)) defined (at the level of\nunderlying modules) by a perfect bilinear form pM : M \u2297R\u2227 M \u2192 R\u2227 (resp. pM :\nM \u2297R/pn R M \u2192 R/pn R). pM is referred as a bilinear principal quasi-polarization of C\nor as a perfect bilinear form of C.\ne) In a) to d) above we have a variant where MF[a,b] (R) is replaced by an arbitrary\nFontaine category of objects.\nB. Examples. We just restrict to situations emerging from the context of a\nShimura filtered \u03c3-crystal (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G) over k. If there is a symmetric perfect form\npM : M \u2297W (k) M \u2192 W (k)(1) such that G normalizes pM , then we refer to the quintuple\n(M, F 1 , \u03c6, G, pM ) as a symmetric principally quasi-polarized Shimura filtered \u03c3-crystal;\nthis notion will play an important role in \u00a75-14.\nLet now Tr (resp. KIL) be the natural trace (resp. Killing) form on Lie(G) (resp.\non Lie(Gad )). They are both fixed by \u03c6 and by inverting p they become perfect. Let\ngR\u2227 \u2208 G(R\u2227 ). We consider the Lie p-divisible objects of MF[\u22121,1] (R)\nC := (Lie(G) \u2297W (k) R\u2227 , gR\u2227 (\u03c6 \u2297 1), F 0 (Lie(G)) \u2297W (k) R\u2227 , F 1 (Lie(G)) \u2297W (k) R\u2227 )\nand\nCad := (Lie(Gad ) \u2297W (k) R\u2227 , gR\u2227 (\u03c6 \u2297 1), F 0 (Lie(Gad )) \u2297W (k) R\u2227 , F 1 (Lie(Gad )) \u2297W (k) R\u2227 ).\n135\n\n\fWe have symmetric quasi-polarizations\nTr : C \u2297R\u2227 C \u2192 R\u2227 (0)\nand\n\nKIL : Cad \u2297R\u2227 Cad \u2192 R\u2227 (0).\n\nIf Tr (resp. KIL) is a perfect form, then C (resp. Cad ) is a symmetric p-divisible object\nof MF[\u22121,1] (R) and C/pn C (resp. Cad /pn Cad ) is a symmetric object of MF[\u22121,1] (R).\nLet now (g, \u03c6, F 0 (g), F 1 (g)) be a Shimura adjoint filtered Lie \u03c3-crystal over k. We\nassume all simple factors of g are either of classical Lie type or of E6 or E7 Lie type. If\nnone of these simple factors are of Am or Cm Lie type with p dividing 2(m + 1), or of\nBm Lie type with p dividing 2(m \u2212 1), or of Dm Lie type with p dividing 2(2m \u2212 1), or\nof E6 or E7 Lie type with p dividing 6, then the Killing form on g is perfect, cf. [Hu2,\np. 48-9] for the E6 and E7 Lie types and cf. [Va2, 5.7.2 and 5.7.2.1] for the classical Lie\ntypes. Loc. cit. excludes the case p = 3 just for the simple reason that [Va2] was focused\non p \u2265 5; but the argument for it is entirely the same (cf. also [Va2, 6.6.6]).\nIf p > 2 and all simple factors of g are of Bm or Cm Lie type with m \u2265 2, or of Dm\nLie type with m \u2265 4, then the classical trace form on g is perfect. To recall the definition\nof the classical trace form for the mentioned Lie types, we can assume all simple factors of\ng are of the same Lie type. Then the classical trace form on g is the multiple of the Killing\nform KIL on g by some r \u2208 Gm (Q), such that its extension to W (k\u0304), when restricted\nto a simple factor F of g \u2297W (k) W (k\u0304), is the trace form associated to the classical (it is\nuniquely determined up to isomorphism; for its complex version we refer to [He, \u00a78 of ch.\n3]) representation of F of dimension d(m) (as p > 2 g is the Lie algebra of any semisimple\ngroup of whose adjoint is the adjoint group over W (k) \u2013it is uniquely determined, cf. end\nof 2.2.13\u2013 having g as its Lie algebra); here d(m) is 2m + 1 or 2m depending on the fact\nthat g is or is not of Bm Lie type.\nSimilarly, if p = 2 and all factors of g are of A2m Lie type, m \u2208 N, then the classical\ntrace form (it is defined similarly to the above paragraph) on g is perfect. So we get:\nFact. If p > 3 and g has no simple factor of Apm\u22121 Lie type with m \u2208 N, or if\np = 3 and g has no simple factor of E6 , E7 or of Apm\u22121 Lie type with m \u2208 N, or if\np = 2 and all factors of g are of some A2m Lie type, m \u2208 N, then (g, F 0 (g), F 1 (g), \u03c6) is\na symmetric p-divisible object of MF[\u22121,1] (W (k)).\nC. Exercise. a) We assume Spec(R/pR) has the ALP property. Show that any\n\u2207\nbilinear principal quasi-polarization of an object C of MF[0,1]\n(R)[p] whose pull backs via\nany W (k)-morphism Spec(W (k\u0304)) \u2192 Spec(R) is symmetric, is in fact symmetric.\nb) We assume p = 2. Show that any symmetric object C of some category\nMF[0,1](\u2217)[2] is alternating.\nHints. We can assume we are in the context of a) of 2.2.23 A, with n = 1, (a, b) =\n(0, 1), k = k\u0304 and R = W (k)[[x1 , ..., xm]], for some m \u2208 N \u222a {0}; moreover M is an R/pRmodule. From very definitions, if mi = \u03c6i (ni ) with ni \u2208 F i (M ), we have pM (mi , mi ) = 0,\n136\n\n\fi \u2208 {0, 1}. But any m \u2208 M can be written as m = a0 m0 + a1 m1 , with a0 , a1 \u2208 R. So, in\ncase b) as pM is symmetric and p = 2, we have pM (m, m) = 0. In case a) we can assume\n\u03a6R takes xi into xpi . Using the fact that pM (m1 , m0 ) = \u03a6R (pM (n1 , n0 )), by induction on\nq \u2208 N we get that pM is symmetric modulo the ideal (x1 , ..., xm)q of R/2R.\n2.2.24. Semisimple elements. Let (M, \u03c6, G) be a quasi p-divisible object with a\nreductive structure over a finite field k. Let k1 be a finite field extension of k such that\nthe extension of (M, \u03c6, G) to k1 is a p-divisible object with a reductive structure over k1 .\nLet m \u2208 N be such that k1 = Fpm . Then for any n \u2208 N, \u03c6mn is a linear automorphism of\nM [ p1 ] and so (as it can be seen by extension to B(k1 )) it is identifiable with an element\nhmn \u2208 G(B(k)). Let hsmn \u2208 G(B(k)) be its semisimple part. The slopes of (M, \u03c6) and\ntheir multiplicities are computed in the standard way from the p-adic valuations and the\nmultiplicities of the eigenvalues of hsmn (see [Man]).\n2.2.24.1. If k is arbitrary, then we can work as well with the semisimple element h(\u03c6)\nof GL(M )(B(k)) which acts on W (\u03b1)(M [ p1 ], \u03c6) as the multiplication with p\u03b1 dimW (k) (M )! .\nAs the slope decompositions of 2.2.3 3) are functorial w.r.t. morphisms between (latticed)\nisocrystals, we get (cf. def. 2.2.8 3a) and 4a)) that h(\u03c6) \u2208 G(B(k)). The image of h(\u03c6)\nin Gab (B(k)) is a class invariant (i.e. by replacing \u03c6 by g\u03c6, with g \u2208 G(W (k)), it remains\nthe same). We conclude:\nFact. If the image of h(\u03c6) in Gad (B(k)) is trivial, then h(\u03c6) is uniquely determined\nby Cl(M, \u03c6, G).\nProof: Any element of Z(Gder )(B(k)) is defined by an element z \u2208 Z(Gder )(W (k))\nby making p invertible; as h(\u03c6) and z commute, if z is non-trivial then the eigenvalues\nof h(\u03c6)z acting on M [ p1 ] are not all integral powers of p. From this the Fact follows.\n2.3. The standard Hodge situation. The whole of 2.3 is dedicated to the foundation of integral aspects of integral canonical models of Shimura varieties of Hodge type: a\nlanguage, a context and many general important features are presented. Implicitly, parts\nof what follows represent the generalization of different parts of [Ko2] (especially of ch. 5\nof loc. cit.). However, the things are far more technical then loc. cit., due to the passage\nfrom tensors of degree 2 (endomorphisms, polarizations, etc.) to tensors of arbitrary degree; here \"tensors\" are thought as some realizations of Hodge cycles of abelian varieties.\nLater on (see 2.3.8 2)) it turns out that the context we introduce (see 2.3.4), though in the\nbeginning might look unnatural or restricted, it is the most general one could think of in\nterms of Hodge embeddings in a reductive Zp -context. In Grothendieck's and Chevalley's\nspirit of foundations of algebraic geometry, we work in a context about which (at least for\np \u2265 3), in \u00a76 we are able to show it is \"free\" of any restriction (assumption) on tensors.\nWe rely heavily on [Va2]. In 2.3.1-17 (resp. 2.3.18) we deal with the case p \u2265 3 (resp.\np = 2).\n2.3.1. The Z(p) setting. Let (W, \u03c8) be a symplectic space over Q and let\nf : Sh(G, X) \u0592\u2192 Sh GSp(W, \u03c8), S\n137\n\n\u0001\n\n\fbe an injective map. Let p \u2265 3 be a rational prime. We assume the existence of a\nZ(p) -lattice L(p) of W such that \u03c8 induces a perfect form\n\u03c8 : L(p) \u2297Z(p) L(p) \u2192 Z(p)\nand the Zariski closure GZ(p) of G in GSp(L(p) , \u03c8) is a reductive group over Z(p) (if needed\nwe can multiply \u03c8 by an element of Gm (Q), cf. [Va2, 4.1.6]). We call such a Z(p) -lattice\ngood w.r.t. the map f (cf. [Va2, 5.8.3]). This assumption implies G is unramified over\nQp . Let v be a prime of E(G, X) dividing p. It is unramified over p, cf. [Mi3, 4.7]. We\nalways view C as an O(v) -algebra (cf. the definition of E(G, X); for instance see [Va2,\n2.6]). Let K := GSp(L(p) , \u03c8)(L(p) \u2297Z(p) Zp ) and let H := K \u2229 G(Qp ). K is a hyperspecial\nsubgroup of GSp(W, \u03c8)(Qp ) (as \u03c8 : L(p) \u2297Z(p) L(p) \u2192 Z(p) is a perfect form) and H is a\nhyperspecial subgroup of G(Qp ) (as GZ(p) is a reductive group and as H = GZ(p) (Zp )).\nLet\ndimQ (W )\ne :=\n\u2208 N.\n2\nLet (v\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J be a family of homogeneous tensors of the essential tensor algebra\nT (W \u2217 ) of W \u2217 \u2295 (W \u2217 )\u2217 = W \u2217 \u2295 W , such that G is the subgroup of GSp(W, \u03c8) fixing v\u03b1 ,\n\u2200\u03b1 \u2208 J (cf. [De4, 3.1 c)]). Sometimes it is more convenient to work with an extended\nfamily\n(v\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J \u2032\n(so J \u2282 J \u2032 ) of such tensors, such that G is the subgroup of GL(W ) fixing v\u03b1 , \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 J \u2032 .\nAlso it is convenient to consider that all elements of Lie(Z(G)) are part of this extended\nfamily (here we identify canonically End(W ) with End(W \u2217 )). As G(Q) contains the\ngroup of scalar automorphisms of W , \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 J \u2032 we have v\u03b1 \u2208 W \u2217\u2297n\u03b1 \u2297Q W \u2297n\u03b1 , with\n\u03b1)\n.\nn\u03b1 := deg(v\n2\nLet G0Z(p) be the maximal reductive subgroup of GZ(p) fixing \u03c8. So\nG0Z(p) = Sp(L(p) , \u03c8) \u2229 GZ(p) ,\nas the center of G0Q has \u22121W as a Q\u2013valued point: this is a consequence of the definition\nof X as a G(R)-conjugacy class of homomorphisms ResC/R Gm \u2192 GR ; so the maximal\ncompact subgroup of ResC/R Gm (R) is connected and, when viewed as a subgroup of\nG(R), contains \u22121W \u2297Q R and is contained in G0Z(p) (R).\nWe have a natural short exact sequence 0 \u2192 G0Z(p) \u0592\u2192 GZ(p) \u0589 Gm \u2192 0 and so a\nnatural isogeny Gm \u00d7 G0Z(p) \u2192 GZ(p) whose kernel is \u03bc2 .\nTo any x \u2208 X it corresponds an injective cocharacter \u03bcx : Gm \u0592\u2192 GC (see [Va2,\n2.2]). We often prefer to view G as a subgroup of GL(W \u2217 ) or of GSp(W \u2217 , \u03c8\u0303), where \u03c8\u0303 is\nthe perfect form on W \u2217 induced naturally by \u03c8, and to emphasize this we denote \u03bcx by\n\u03bc\u2217x ; so \u03bc\u2217x defines, as in [Va2, 2.2], the Hodge structure on W \u2217 corresponding to x \u2208 X.\n\u03bc\u2217x achieves a direct sum decomposition W \u2217 \u2297Q C = Fx1 \u2295 Fx0 , with \u03b2 \u2208 Gm (C) acting\nthrough it on Fxi as the multiplication with \u03b2 \u2212i , i = 0, 1.\n138\n\n\f2.3.2. The moduli setting for the Siegel modular variety. We get an injective\nmap\n\n\u0001\nf : (G, X, H, v) \u0592\u2192 GSp(W, \u03c8), S, K, p\n\nof Shimura quadruples. Let M be the extension\u0001 to O(v) of the integral canonical model\nof the Shimura quadruple GSp(W, \u03c8), S, K, p . It is known (for instance see [Va2,\n3.2.9 and 4.1]) that M parameterizes isomorphism classes of principally polarized abelian\nschemes of dimension e over O(v) -schemes having, in a compatible way, level-N symplectic\nsimilitude structure for any N \u2208 N relatively prime to p; the choice of a Z-lattice L of\nW such that L \u2297Z Z(p) = L(p) and \u03c8 : L \u2297Z L \u2192 Z (makes sense and) is a perfect form\nis implicit here, cf. [Va2, 4.1]. Here, as well as everywhere else, the level structures and\ntheir compatibilities are as in [Va2, paragraph before 4.1.0].\n2.3.3. The integral canonical model. Let N be the integral canonical model of\n(G, X, H, v) (for p \u2265 5 cf. [Va2, 6.4.1] and the defs. of [Va2, 3.2.6]; for p = 3 cf. \u00a76). As\nM has the extension property (see [Va2, 2.3.3 3) and 6)]), we have (cf. also [Va2, 3.2.7\n4)]) a natural O(v) -morphism\niN : N \u2192 M.\n[Va2, 3.2.12] implies: N is the normalization of the Zariski closure of ShH (G, X) in M.\nFrom the proof of [Va2, 3.4.1] we deduce: iN is a finite morphism and not just pro-finite.\nThe universal principally polarized abelian scheme over M gives birth, by pull back,\nto a principally polarized abelian scheme (A, PA ) over N . A is naturally endowed with\na family (w\u03b1A )\u03b1\u2208J \u2032 of Hodge cycles. Argument: due to the existence of level structures,\nthis can be read out from an \u00e9tale Ql -context, with l a prime different from p; in other\nwords, all Hodge cycles of the pull back of A to Sh(G, X) are already Hodge cycles of A\nand so [Va2, 4.1.1-2] applies. So the points of N with values in fields K of characteristic\n0, give birth to principally polarized abelian varieties (obtained from (A, PA ) by pull\nback), having a family (w\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J \u2032 of Hodge cycles (obtained from (w\u03b1A )\u03b1\u2208J \u2032 by pull back)\nand compatible level-N symplectic similitude structures, for any N \u2208 N with (N, p) = 1,\nsuch that some additional conditions are satisfied (cf. loc. cit.).\nWe denote by H0 an arbitrary compact, open subgroup of G(Apf ) such that:\na) the quotient morphism N \u2192 N /H0 is a pro-\u00e9tale cover;\nb) there is a principally polarized abelian scheme (AH0 , PAH0 ) over N /H0 , with\n(A, PA ) obtained from it by pull back via the pro-\u00e9tale cover N \u2192 N /H0 .\nN /H0 is a quasi-projective, smooth O(v) -scheme, cf. [Va2, 6.4.1]: this is a consequence of the fact that the morphism iN is finite. Warning: we do not assume that the\nfamily of Hodge cycles (w\u03b1A )\u03b1\u2208J \u2032 is definable over N /H0 (i.e. is obtained by pulling back\na family of Hodge cycles of AH0 ); also we do not assume H0 \u00d7 H is included in (some\nspecific compact, open subgroup of) GSp(L\u0303, \u03c8)(L\u0303 \u2297Z \u1e90) for some Z-lattice L\u0303 of W such\nthat we have a perfect form \u03c8 : L\u0303 \u2297Z L\u0303 \u2192 Z (however, in many cases, the proof of [Va2,\n6.7.2] can be used to show that we can assume that such an inclusion does exist). Also\n139\n\n\ffor the sake of future study (involving twists), we do not impose any restriction (besides\nb)) on (AH0 , PAH0 ); in particular, even if we have\n(IN CL)\n\nH0 \u00d7 H \u2282 K(N ) := {g \u2208 GSp(L, \u03c8)(L \u2297Z \u1e90)|g \u2261 1L\u2297Z \u1e90 mod N },\n\nfor some N \u2208 N \\ {1, 2}, with (N, p) = 1, we do not assume it is the pull back of the\nuniversal principal polarized abelian scheme over M/K p (N ) having level-N symplectic\nsimilitude structure. Here K p (N ) \u2282 GSp(W, \u03c8)(Apf ) is a subgroup such that we have a\nnatural identification K(N ) = K p (N ) \u00d7 K. However, by passing to a normal, open subgroup of H0 , (AH0 , PAH0 ) becomes isomorphic to such a pull back, under an isomorphism\nwhich over N it becomes the one of b). Warning: despite the notation (AH0 , PAH0 ), this\npair does not depend only on H0 .\nLet H\u03030 be an arbitrary compact, open subgroup of G(Apf ). We denote by cp (H\u03030 )\n(resp. by cp (H\u03030 , v)) the number of connected components of the generic (resp. special)\nfibre of N /H\u03030 . From [Va2, 6.4.6 3)] (see also [Va2, 3.2.7 2)]) we get: this number is\nindependent of which hyperspecial subgroup H of G(Qp ) we are dealing with and so the\nnotations are justified.\n2.3.3.1. The compact type case. If (G, X) is of compact type, then N /H0 is a\nprojective, smooth O(v) -scheme, cf. [Va2, 6.4.1.1 2)] (the proof of loc. cit. applies to the\ncase p = 3 as well).\n2.3.3.2. The abelian and adjoint counterparts. We denote by N ad (resp.\nby N ab ) the integral canonical model of the adjoint (resp. toric) Shimura quadruple\n(Gad , X ad , H ad , v ad ) (resp. (Gab , X ab , H ab , v ab )) of (G, X, H, v). In connection to the\nexistence of N ad for p = 3 (resp. of N ab for p \u2265 3) we refer to \u00a76, cf. also [Va2, 6.2.2\nb)] and AE.4.1 (resp. we refer to [Va2, 3.2.8]). Let H0ad (resp. H0ab ) be a compact,\nopen subgroup of Gad (Apf ) (resp. of Gab (Apf )) such that under the natural epimorphism\nG \u0589 Gad (resp. G \u0589 Gab ) it contains the image of H0 . Warning: we do not assume\nN ad /H0ad is smooth over O(v ad ) . On the other hand, N ab /H0ab is always an \u00e9tale cover\nof Spec(O(v ab ) ), cf. [Va2, 3.2.8]. In the same way we got the existence of iN , we get the\nexistence of an O(v) -morphism\nqN : N \u2192 NOad(v) \u00d7O(v) NOab(v) .\nFrom [Va2, 6.4.5 b)] (cf. also [Va2, 6.2.2-3] and AE.4.1) we get that it is a pro-finite,\npro-\u00e9tale morphism (for p = 3 cf. also \u00a76). If N ad is a pro-\u00e9tale cover of the smooth\nO(v ad ) -scheme N ad /H0ad , then the similarly defined O(v) -morphism\nqN (H0 ) : N /H0 \u2192 NOad(v) /H0ad \u00d7O(v) NOab(v) /H0ab\nis an \u00e9tale cover of its image.\n2.3.4. Definition. The Z(p) -lattice L(p) of W is said to be crystalline well positioned\nfor the map f w.r.t. v, if, besides the property mentioned in 2.3.1 (i.e. it is good w.r.t.\nf ), it also satisfies the following property:\n140\n\n\f(\u2217) for any perfect field k of characteristic p and for every z \u2208 N (W (k)), the triple\n(A, (w\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J , pA ) := z\u0001\u2217 (A, (w\u03b1A )\u03b1\u2208J , PA ) is such that the Zariski closure in GL(M ) (with\n1\n1\nM := Hcrys\nA/W (k) = HdR\n(A/W (k))) of the subgroup of GL(M [ p1 ]) fixing the perfect\nalternating form pA : M \u2297W (k) M \u2192 W (k)(1) (induced by the polarization pA ) and the\ncrystalline (de Rham) component t\u03b1 of w\u03b1 (t\u03b1 is a homogeneous tensor of T (M [ p1 ])),\n\u2200\u03b1 \u2208 J , is a reductive group G\u0303 over W (k).\nIf L(p) is crystalline well positioned for the map f w.r.t. any prime v of E(G, X)\ndividing p, then we say L(p) is crystalline well positioned for the map f .\n2.3.5. Basic definition. A triple (f, L(p) , v) as in 2.3.1, with L(p) a Z(p) -lattice of\nW which is crystalline well positioned for the map f w.r.t. v, is called a standard Hodge\nsituation, abbreviated SHS. If moreover there is a Z(p) -subalgebra B of End(L(p) ), which\nover W (F) is a product of matrix W (F)-algebras, which is self dual w.r.t. \u03c8, and is such\nthat the subgroup of GSp(W, \u03c8) fixing its elements has G as its connected component of\nthe origin, then the quadruple (f, L(p) , v, B) is called a standard PEL situation (we recall\nthat PEL stands for polarization, endomorphisms and level structures).\n2.3.5.1. Exercise. Let (G0 , X0 ) be an adjoint Shimura pair such that all its\nsimple factors are of An type for some n \u2208 N. Let p > 2 be a prime such that G0 is\nunramified over Qp . Show that there is an injective map f : (G, X) \u0592\u2192 (GSp(W, \u03c8), S),\nwith (Gad , X ad ) = (G0 , X0 ), and a Z(p) -lattice L(p) of W good w.r.t. f , such that for\nany prime v of E(G, X) dividing p we get a standard PEL situation (f, L(p) , v, B), for\na suitable Z(p) -subalgebra B of End(L(p) ). Hint: [Va2, 6.5.1] allows us to assume G0 is\nQ\u2013simple and for such a case see [Va2, 6.5.1.1 and Case 2 of 6.6.5.1]; in other words, loc.\ncit. handles the case p \u2265 5 and so, for p = 3 we just have to literally copy the arguments\nfor p \u2265 5.\n2.3.5.2. The factors. Let (f, L(p) , v) be a SHS. Let\n(Gad , X ad ) =\n\nY\n\n(Gj , Xj )\n\nj\u2208F(Gad )\n\nbe the direct factor decomposition in simple, adjoint Shimura pairs. Here F (Gad ) is a\nfinite set of indices, indexing the Q\u2013simple factors of Gad . We have:\nFact 1. For any j \u2208 F (Gad ) there is an injective map fj : (Gj , X j ) \u0592\u2192 (G, X) such\nthat:\na) Gjder is the semisimple subgroup of G naturally isogeneous to Gj (so (Gjad , X jad ) =\n\nad\n(Gad\nj , Xj ));\n\nb) (f \u25e6 fj , L(p) , vj ) is a SHS, for any prime v j of E(Gj , X j ) dividing v.\nProof: [Va2, 3.2.7 11)] takes right away care of a) and to get b) we just need to\nuse simple arguments. Following loc. cit., we can assume Gj is generated by Gjder and\nby a maximal torus of G whose Zariski closure in GZ(p) is a maximal torus of GZ(p) ; so\n141\n\n\f(cf. [Va2, 3.1.6]) the Zariski closure of Gj in GZ(p) is a reductive subgroup GjZ(p) . Let\nH j := H \u2229 Gj (Qp ). Let N j be the integral canonical model of the Shimura quadruple\n(Gj , X j , H j , v j ). In the same way we got iN , we get naturally a finite O(v j ) -morphism\nijN : N j \u2192 NO(vj ) .\nThe fact that the triple (f \u25e6 fj , L(p) , vj ) is a SHS, can be deduced immediately from [Va2,\n3.1.6] via [Va2, 4.3.13] (to be compared with the proof of [Va2, 5.7.1]). To recall the\ndetails, we refer to 2.3.4, with z factoring through Nj . Defining G\u0303j in the similar way,\n[Va2, 4.3.13] \"takes care\" of the maximal subtorus of Z(GjZ(p) ) (i.e. it implies that the\nZariski closure in GL(M ) of the connected component of the origin of Z(G\u0303jB(k) ) is a\ntorus), while the fact that (f, L(p) , v) is a SHS \"takes care\" of the derived part of GZ(p)\n(i.e. it implies that the Zariski closure in GL(M ) of G\u0303der\njB(k) is a semisimple group); it is\n[Va2, 3.1.6] which \"takes care\" of combining the toric part with the derived part. This\nproves Fact 1.\nSo from many points of view (for instance, see Fact 2 below), for the study of a SHS\n(f, L(p) , v), we can assume Gad is a simple Q\u2013group; however, for the sake of generality,\nwe never assume this a priori.\nLet qGad be the order of the center of the simply connected group cover of Gder\nC . We\nhave:\nFact 2. A connected component C0 of NW (F) is a quotient of the product \u00d7j\u2208F(Gad ) C0j ,\nj\n2\nwith C0j a connected component of NW\n(F) , through a pro-finite, qGad -torsion abelian group.\nProof: First, it is irrelevant which connected components we choose, cf. [Va2, 3.3.2].\nSecond, we need to apply [Va2, 3.2.16] to the Shimura quadruple\nY\nY\nY\n(\nGj ,\nXj ,\nH j , w),\nj\u2208F(Gad )\n\nj\u2208F(Gad )\n\nj\u2208F(Gad )\n\nwhere w is the prime of the composite field of all reflex fields E(Gj , X j )'s dividing all\nvQj 's. Third, we need to consider a cover (G\u0303, X\u0303, H\u0303, \u1e7d) \u2192 (G, X, H, v), such that G\u0303der =\nder\nj\u2208F(Gad ) Gj , cf. [Va2, 3.2.7 10)]. So, Fact 2 follows by combining [Va2, 6.2.3 and\n6.2.3.1].\nThe mentioned torsion abelian group is trivial if Gder = \u00d7j\u2208F(Gad ) Gjder , cf. [Va2,\n6.2.3]; in fact here the word if can be replaced by iff, as it can be easily deduced from\n[Va2, 3.3.1] and [De2, 2.1.7].\n2.3.5.3. PEL-envelopes. The PEL-envelope f1 : (G1 , X1 ) \u0592\u2192 (GSp(W, \u03c8), S) of\nf was introduced in [Va2, 4.3.12]: G1 is the connected component of the origin of the\nsubgroup of GSp(W, \u03c8) centralizing the Lie algebra BQ of endomorphisms of W fixed by\nG, while X1 is uniquely determined by requiring f to factor through f1 . Let\nB := BQ \u2229 End(L(p) ).\n142\n\n\fLet v1 be the prime of E(G1 , X1 ) divided by v. If the quadruple (f1 , L(p) , v1 , B) is a\nstandard PEL situation, then we refer to it as the PEL-envelope of (f, L(p) , v).\n2.3.5.4. Automorphisms. The group of automorphisms of the Shimura triple\n(G, X, H) (or quadruple (G, X, H, v)) is a subgroup Aut((G, X, H)) of Aut(GZ(p) )(Z(p) ),\ncf. [Va2, 3.2.7 9)] and AE.0. We consider the natural homomorphism\na(G,X,H) : Aut((G, X, H)) \u2192 Aut(Gad\nZ(p) )(Z(p) ).\nIf Gab itself is the smallest subtorus of Gab through whose extension to R the homomorab\nphism ResC/R Gm \u2192 Gab\nfactors, then a(G,X,H) is injective and its image\nR defining X\n(identifiable with Aut((G, X, H))) is a subgroup of finite index of Aut(Gad\nZ(p) )(Z(p) ). So,\n(cf. also [De1, 1.6]) we have\nAut((GSp(W, \u03c8), S, K)) = Aut(GSpad (L(p) , \u03c8))(Z(p) ).\nThe subgroup of this last group normalizing f (i.e., under this identification, normalizing\nG and \u2013over R\u2013 taking X onto itself) is called the automorphism group of (f, L(p) , v) and\nis denoted by Aut(f, L(p) , v).\nLet now g \u2208 Aut(f, L(p) , v). We denote by ag the O(v) -automorphism of M it defines\nnaturally (cf. 2.2.1.5.1 and natural extension of scalars). It leaves invariant the closed\nsubscheme ShH (G, X) of ME(G,X) and so it gives birth to an O(v) -automorphism bg of\nN ; we have:\niN \u25e6 bg = ag \u25e6 iN .\n2.3.5.5. Standard covers. We consider a reductive subgroup G1 of GL(W ) containing G and such that Gder\n= Gder . Let X1 be the G1R (R)-conjugacy class of any\n1\nelement of X. We get a Shimura pair (G1 , X1 ) (see the axioms of [Va2, 2.3]). We have\nE(G, X) = E(G1 , X1 ). If G1 6= G (resp. if G1 6= G and G1 is a subgroup of GSp(W, \u03c8)),\nthen (G1 , X1 ) is an enlargement of (G, X) (resp. of (G, X) in (GSp(W, \u03c8), S)) in the\nsense of [Va3, 4.3.1 and 4.3.1.1].\nIn practice G1 is generated by G and by a maximal torus of the centralizer of G in\nGL(W ). In such a case Z(G1 ) is a torus: it is the group of invertible elements of the\nsemisimple, commutative Q\u2013subalgebra Lie(Z(G1 )) of End(W ). So we get:\nad\nFact 1. The adjoint map a1 : (G1 , X1 ) \u2192 (Gad\n1 , X1 ) is a cover (in the sense of\n[Va2, 2.4]). So X1 = X ad (cf. [Mi1, 4.11]).\n\nWe refer to a1 as a standard cover defined by f . We can assume G1 is unramified\nover Qp , cf. [Va2, 3.1.4]. If moreover the Zariski closure G1Z(p) of G1 in GL(L(p) ) is a\nreductive group over Z(p) , then we refer to a1 as a standard cover defined by (f, L(p) );\nthe Shimura quadruple (G1 , X1 , H1 , v), with H1 := G1 (Qp ) \u2229 GL(L(p) )(Z(p) ), is referred\nas a standard extension of (G, X, H, v) obtained via (f, L(p) ).\nFact 2. If the centralizer CZ(p) of Gder\nZ(p) in GL(L(p) ) is a reductive group over Z(p) ,\nthen standard covers defined by (f, L(p) ) do exist.\n143\n\n\fProof: We consider (see [Har, 5.5.3]) a maximal torus of CZ(p) and we take G1 to\nbe generated by its generic fibre and by Gder . The fact that G1Z(p) is a reductive group,\nis implied by [Va2, 3.1.6]. This ends the proof.\nWe assume now that a1 is a standard cover defined by (f, L(p) ). Let N1 be the\nintegral canonical model of (G1 , X1 , H1 , v), cf. [Va2, 6.2.3]. Based on [Va2, 3.2.7 4) and\n3.2.15], we have a natural open closed O(v) -embedding i1 : N \u0592\u2192 N1 . Moreover the\nnatural O(v) -morphism\nqN1 : N1 \u2192 NOad(v)\nis a pro-\u00e9tale cover (cf. [Mi1, 4.13] and [Va2, 6.4.5.1 b)]; for p = 3 cf. also \u00a76). From the\nvery definition of X1 , we have:\nFact 3. The monomorphisms ResC/R Gm \u0592\u2192 G1R defined by elements of X1 , factor\nthrough GR and so through GSp(W \u2297Q R, \u03c8).\n2.3.5.6. Remark. Fact 3 allows the interpretation of N1E(G,X) as a moduli scheme\nof principally Z(p) -polarized abelian varieties over E(G, X)-schemes of dimension e, endowed with a family of Hodge cycles (still indexable by J \u2032 ) and having compatibly\nlevel-N structures (not necessarily symplectic similitude ones), \u2200N \u2208 N with (N, p) = 1,\nand satisfying some axioms. As this is very much the same as [Va2, 4.1 and 4.1.0] (we\njust need to allow principal Z(p) -polarizations as well as level-N structures which are not\nnecessarily symplectic similitude ones), we will not repeat the details here.\n2.3.5.6.1. Variants. A. We refer to 2.3.5.5. We assume G1 is unramified over Qp\nbut the Zariski closure of G1 in GL(L(p) ) is not a reductive group. From [Va2, 3.1.1 and\n3.2.7.1] we deduce the existence of a hyperspecial subgroup H1 of G1 (Qp ) containing H\nand which is the group of Zp -valued points of a reductive group G1Z(p) having G1 as its\ngeneric fibre and having GZ(p) as a closed subgroup. So, we can still speak about i1 and\nqN1 . Based on [Va2, 3.3.1-2], 2.3.5.6 still makes sense in such a situation.\nWe consider a Z(p) -lattice L1 (p) of W such that the Zariski closure of G1 in GL(L1 (p) )\nis G1Z(p) , cf. [Ja, 10.4 of Part I] and [Va2, 3.1.2.1 c)]. We refer to a1 as a standard cover\ndefined by (f, L1 (p) ). Even better, we consider the standard monomorphism\nsm : SL(L1 (p) ) \u0592\u2192 GSp(L1 2(p) , \u03c81 )\n(as in [Va2, 6.6.5 d1)]; to be compared with [Va2, 6.5.1.1 v)]), with \u03c81 a suitable perfect\nalternating form on L1 2(p) := L1 (p) \u2295 L1 (p) . Let W1 := L1 2(p) \u2297Z(p) Q. We get naturally an\ninjective map\nf \u0303 : (G, X) \u0592\u2192 (GSp(W1 , \u03c81 ), S1 )\n(the restriction of f \u0303 to G0 is the composite of the monomorphism G0 \u0592\u2192 SL(W ) with\nthe generic fibre of sm) such that G1Z(p) is naturally a subgroup of GL(L1 2(p) ).\nB. We have a variant of 2.3.5.5-6 and A, where G1 is generated by G and by the\ncenter of the centralizer of G in GL(W ). What we gain in this case: the torus Z(G1 ) is\n144\n\n\fthe group of invertible elements of a semisimple, commutative Q\u2013subalgebra of End(W )\nleft invariant by the involution of End(W ) defined by \u03c8. So we have the following logical\ntwo extensions of the interpretation of 2.3.5.6.\n(INTR1) If moreover Gder is the derived subgroup of the connected component of the origin\nG\u2032 of the centralizer C(G1 ) of Z(G1 ) in GSp(W, \u03c8), then a similar interpretation\nas in 2.3.5.6 holds for N1 itself: we just need to replace Hodge cycles by Z(p) endomorphisms and to use Serre\u2013Tate's deformation theory (to be compared with\n[Ko2, ch. 5]). Warning: if C(G1 ) 6= G\u2032 , then we still do not need to mention Hodge\ncycle which are not Z(p) -endomorphisms, as C(G1 ) is a subgroup of G1 .\n(INTR2) If Gder is not the derived subgroup of G\u2032 , then denoting by X \u2032 the G\u2032 (R)-conjugacy\nclass of homomorphisms ResC/R Gm \u2192 G\u2032R generated by X, we get a PEL type embedding f \u2032 : (G\u2032 , X \u2032 ) \u0592\u2192 (GSp(W, \u03c8), S). Let v \u2032 be the prime of E(G\u2032 , X \u2032 ) divided\n\u2032\nby v. As Z(G1 ) is unramified over Qp (it splits over Qun\np as G1 does), G is as\n\u2032\n\u2032\nwell unramified over Qp . If G1 and respectively N1 have (by working with v \u2032 ) the\nsame meaning for G\u2032 as G1 and N1 have for G, we get naturally (see iN of 2.3.3) a\nfinite O(v \u2032 ) -morphism N1 \u2192 N1\u2032 and so to any F-valued point of N1 it is attached\nnaturally (cf. (INTR1)) a principally Z(p) -polarized abelian variety over F of dimension e, endowed with a family of Z(p) -endomorphisms (indexed by the elements of\nLie(Z(G1 )) \u2229 End(L(p) )) and having compatibly level-N structures (not necessarily\nsymplectic similitude ones), \u2200N \u2208 N with (N, p) = 1.\n2.3.5.7. Remark. We refer to the Existence Property of 1.10. From [Va2, 6.5.1.1\ni) and the first part of 6.6.5.1] we deduce that we can moreover assume that the representation of G0der\nW (F) on GL(L(p) \u2297Z(p) W (F)) is a direct sum of irreducible representations\nsuch that:\n\u2013 each simple (irreducible) direct factor of it is a representation associated to a\nminimal weight of a product factor of G0der\nW (F) having a simple adjoint, and so its special\n(cf. also [Bo1, 6.4 and 7.3]).\nfibre is an irreducible subrepresentation of G0der\nF\nSo in such a case CZ(p) is a reductive group, and so Fact 2 applies. Moreover, referring\nto 2.3.5.6.1 B, we have: as the Zariski closure of Z(G1 ) in GL(L(p) ) is a torus of GL(L(p) )\nwhose Lie algebra B is self dual w.r.t. \u03c8, the triple (f \u2032 , L(p) , v \u2032 , B) is a standard PEL\nsituation.\n2.3.5.8. An application: the proof of AE.4.2 a). The case p = 3 is very much\nthe same (see \u00a76). So, to be simpler in references, we assume p \u2265 5. Let (G1 , X1 , H1 , v1 )\nbe a Shimura quadruple of preabelian type, with v1 dividing p. Let N1 (resp. N1ad ) be its\nintegral canonical model (resp. be the integral canonical model of its adjoint), cf. [Va2,\n6.4.2] and AE.4.1. Let H01 be a subgroup of G1 (Apf ) such that H01 \u00d7 H1 is a subgroup\nof G1 (Af ) smooth for (G1 , X1 ). If p does not divide t(Gad\n1 ), the fact that N1 is a pro\u00e9tale cover of N1 /H01 is implied by the Proposition of AE.4. We now assume p|t(Gad\n1 )\nand H01 \u00d7 H1 is p-smooth for (G1 , X1 ). We need to show that N1 is a pro-\u00e9tale cover\nof N1 /H01 . As this is a problem of connected components of N1W (F) , we can assume\n145\n\n\f(cf. Definition 1 of AE.4), that there is a prime l different from p and such that the\nad\nimage of H01 in Gad\n1 (Ql ) is contained in a compact, open subgroup H01l having no pro-p\np,l\nlad\nsubgroups. Let H01\nbe a compact, open subgroup of Gad\n1 (Af ) containing the image of\nH01 in it; here Ap,l\nf denotes the ring of finite ad\u00e8les whose both p- and l-components are\nomitted.\nad\nAs the natural O(v1 ) -morphism N1 \u2192 N1O\nis pro-\u00e9tale (see [Va2, 6.4.5 b)]), and\n(v1 )\nas the quotient O(v1 ) -morphism N1 \u2192 N1 /H01 factors through the natural morphism\nad\nad\nN1 \u2192 N1O\n/H\u030301\n, with\n(v )\n1\n\nad\nlad\nad\nH\u030301\n:= H01\n\u00d7 H01l\n,\n\nwe can assume G1 is adjoint. Based on [Va2, 3.4.5.1], it is enough to show that the\nlad\nlad\nmorphism N1ad \u2192 N1ad /H01\nis a pro-\u00e9tale cover; here the role of H01\nis that of an\np,l\nad\narbitrary compact subgroup of G1 (Af ). Based on this and on [Va2, 3.2.16], we can\nassume G1 is Q\u2013simple. So based on 2.3.5.7, not to introduce extra notations, (by moving\nback to a G1 which is not adjoint but has a Q\u2013simple adjoint) we can assume that:\n\u2013 we have a SHS (f, L(p) , v) and we are in the context of a standard cover a1 :\nad\nad\nad\n(G1 , X1 ) \u2192 (Gad\n1 , X1 ) = (G , X ) defined by (f, L(p) );\np\nad\n\u2013 with the notations of 2.3.5.5, we are dealing with a subgroup H\u030301\nof Gad\n1 (Af ) which\nad\nhas the above shape and properties (so in particular, H\u030301\n\u00d7 Gad\n1Z(p) (Zp ) is p-smooth for\nad\n(Gad\n1 , X1 )).\nad\nlad\n0\nA connected component of N1W\n(F) /H01 is a quotient of a connected component C\nof N1W (F) through a group of automorphisms GA of N1W (F) leaving invariant C 0 and\ndefined by translations by a subgroup of G1 (Apf ) whose image in Gad\n1 (Ql ) is trivial, cf.\n0\n[Mi1, 4.13] and [Va2, 3.3.1]. If h \u2208 GA fixes y \u2208 C (F), then as in AE.4.1 we get that\nh acts trivially on C 0 (F) (we need to work precisely with l). Warning: here we dot\nneed to bother about Hodge cycles which are not defined by endomorphisms, i.e. in\nconnection to the Z(p) -automorphism a we get (as in AE.4.1) we are bothered just about\nZ(p) -polarizations, level structures (and if one desires, about Z(p) -endomorphisms), cf.\n2.3.6.1 (INTR2). So C 0 is a pro-\u00e9tale cover of C 0 /GA. This ends the proof of AE.4.2 a).\n\n2.3.5.8.1. Variant. What follows is a natural extension of AE.4.1.1 and so provides\na variant of the last paragraph of 2.3.5.8; so we can assume Gad is Q\u2013simple. If it is of\nsome An Lie type with p|n + 1, then we can proceed as in AE.4.1.1 to get that we can\nassume that moreover h \u2208 G(Apf ). If Gad is not of An Lie type with p|n + 1, then qGad\n(see 2.3.5.2) is relatively prime to p and so for any h\u0303 \u2208 Gad (Apf ) there is q\u0303 \u2208 N, with\n(q\u0303, p) = 1, such that h\u0303q\u0303 belongs to the image of Gder (Apf ) in Gad (Apf ). So, as in AE.4.1.1,\nwe can assume that h \u2208 G(Apf ); we conclude:\nRegardless of how Gad is, in the last paragraph of 2.3.5.8, the use of \"Z(p) -\" in front\nof polarizations (and isogenies) can be entirely avoided.\n146\n\n\f2.3.6. Examples. We refer to 2.3.1. If the family of tensors (v\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J is Z(p) -well\npositioned w.r.t. \u03c8 for the group G, if it is enveloped by L(p) (see [Va2, 4.3.4] for the\nmeaning of these), and if it is of degree at most 2(p \u2212 2), then the triple (f, L(p) , v)\nis a SHS (cf. [Va2, 5.1 and 5.6.5]). More generally, if there is a family of tensors of\nT (L(p) \u2297Z(p) W (F)) which is W (F)-well positioned for GW (F) and of degree at most\n2(p \u2212 2), then the triple (f, L(p) , v) is a SHS, cf. [Va2, 5.6.9].\nIn particular, if f is a good embedding w.r.t. p (see def. [Va2, 5.8.1]), then there\nis a Z(p) -lattice of W which is crystalline well positioned for the map f . From this the\nExistence Property of 1.10 follows.\n2.3.6.1. The d-invariants. Let W\u0303 be a finite dimensional vector space over a\nfield k\u0303. We assume k\u0303 is either of characteristic 0 or it is perfect of arbitrary positive\ncharacteristic. We consider a faithful representation f \u0303 : G\u0303 \u0592\u2192 GL(W\u0303 ), with G\u0303 a reductive\ngroup over k\u0303. We assume it is not an isomorphism. If G\u0303 contains the 1 dimensional torus\nT\u03031 of scalar automorphisms of W\u0303 , then we also assume the existence of a non-degenerate\nbilinear form \u03c8\u0303 on W\u0303 or on its dual normalized by G\u0303. The existence of the numbers\nintroduced by the following definition is a consequence of [De4, 3.1 c)] and of the finite\ndimensionality of W\u0303 .\nDefinition. Let d(f \u0303) \u2208 N \u222a {0} (resp. d0 (f \u0303) \u2208 N \u222a {0}) be the smallest number\nsuch that there is a family of tensors of T (W\u0303 ) of degree at most d(f \u0303) (resp. at most\nd0 (f \u0303)) such that the subgroup of GL(W\u0303 ) fixing all its members and, in case G\u0303 contains\nT\u03031 , normalizing \u03c8\u0303, is G\u0303 (resp. has G\u0303 as the connected component of its origin). We refer\nto d(f \u0303) (resp. to d0 (f \u0303)) as the d-invariant (resp. as the d0 -invariant) of f \u0303.\nWe have d(f \u0303) \u2265 d0 (f \u0303). By enlarging k\u0303, these numbers remain the same. So let d1 (f \u0303)\n(resp. d2 (f \u0303)) be the d-invariant (resp. the d0 -invariant) of the natural representation of\nan arbitrary maximal torus of G\u0303 on W\u0303 . Let d3 (f \u0303) (resp. d4 (f \u0303)) be the d-invariant (resp.\nthe d0 -invariant) of the natural representation of G\u0303der on W\u0303 . Let d5 (f \u0303) (resp. d6 (f \u0303))\nbe the d-invariant (resp. the d0 -invariant) of the natural representation of the maximal\nsubtorus of Z(G\u0303) on W\u0303 .\nExample. We refer to 2.2.9 5). We assume G does not contain the 1 dimensional\nsplit torus of scalar automorphisms of M . Then the d-invariant of the representation of\nGB(k) on M [ p1 ] is deg(M, \u03c6, G). The proof of this is very much the same as the proof of\nthe Fact of 2.2.9 1').\nIf (f, L(p) , v) is a SHS, we refer to the numbers d(f ), d0 (f ), d1 (f ),..., d6 (f ), d(fp ),\nd0 (fp ), d3 (fp ) and d4 (fp ) as its d-invariants. Here f is identified with a representation of\nG on W and\nfp : GFp \u0592\u2192 GL(L(p) /pL(p) )\nis the (alternating) faithful representation defined naturally by the closed embedding\nGZ(p) \u0592\u2192 GL(L(p) ). Warning: simple arguments involving representations of tori show\nthat we have di (fp ) = di (f ) for i \u2208 {1, 2, 5, 6}; but we have no a priori reason to think\nthat in general this automatically holds for i \u2208 {0, 3, 4} or that d(f ) = dp (f ). From the\n147\n\n\fsecond paragraph of 2.3.1, we get: d(f ), d0 (f ), d1 (f ), d2 (f ), d5 (f ) and d6 (f ) are even\nnumbers. Any one of the conditions d(f ) = 0 or d0 (f ) = 0 are equivalent to f being an\nisomorphism.\nUsing the language of [Va2, 4.3.1], we have: if (G, X) is saturated in (GSp(W, \u03c8), S),\nthen d0 (f ) \u2264 4. In general we do not know when d0 (f ) = 4. If we have a standard PEL\nsituation (f, L(p) , v, B), then d0 (f ) \u2208 {0, 2} but (see the D case in [Ko2, \u00a75]) it can happen\nthat d(f ) \u2265 4.\n2.3.7. Convention. Whenever we consider a SHS (f, L(p) , v), we use freely the\nnotations of 2.3.1-3 and of 2.3.5.2.\n2.3.8. Remarks. 1) We do not know when the converse of 2.3.6 is true. That\nis, we do not know for which SHS (f, L(p) , v) there is a family (v\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J of homogeneous\ntensors of the essential tensor algebra of W \u2217 \u2295 W , which is Z(p) -well positioned w.r.t. \u03c8\nfor G, is enveloped by L(p) , and is of degree at most 2(p \u2212 2). It is not hard to see, that\nfor p = 3 we do need that at least one of the following two conditions is satisfied:\n\u2013 d0 (f ) is 0 or 2;\n\u2013 there is a saturated enlargement (G1 , X1 ) (see def. [Va2, 4.3.1]) of (G, X) in\n(GSp(W, \u03c8), S) such that the d0 -invariant of the representation of G1 on W is 2.\n2) A major result of \u00a76 states that any Z(p) -lattice L(p) of W good w.r.t. f is\nautomatically crystalline well positioned for the map f . In particular, we will see in \u00a76\nthat in 2.3.5.6.1 A we get a SHS (f \u0303, L1 2(p) , v).\n3) Usually when we mention the polarizations we use the set of indices J (i.e. we\nwould like to \"carry\" as few Hodge cycles as possible); when we do not, then we use J \u2032 .\nIf this is confusing to the reader, the reader can assume J = J \u2032 .\n4) We consider a quadruple (f, L(p) , v, B) which satisfies all requirements of a standard PEL situation, except that (f, L(p) , v) is a SHS. Then such a quadruple is a standard\nPEL situation. For the case when BQ := B \u2297Z(p) Q is a simple Q\u2013algebra, cf. [LR] and\n[Ko2, ch. 5] (cf. also [Va2, 5.6.3] and AE.1 for very detailed proofs in the spirit of arbitrary SHS's). Warning: in the way we defined a standard PEL situation, BQ := B \u2297Z(p) Q\nis not necessarily a Q\u2013simple algebra and so Gad does not necessarily have all its simple\nfactors of the same Lie type. However, [Va2, 4.3.11] and its slight correction of AE.1, still\napply (versus [Va2, 5.6.3]) to such a general Z(p) -algebra B: just the third paragraph of\n[Va2, p. 469] has to be modified (we need to define separately a number n \u2208 N as in loc.\ncit. for each simple factor of BQ ).\n2.3.8.1. Exercise. Let (G, X, H, v) be a Shimura quadruple of Hodge type, with v\ndividing p \u2265 3. Assuming 2.3.8 2), show that there is a SHS (f, L(p) , v) for which we do\nhave H = GZ(p) (L(p) \u2297Z(p) Zp ). Hint: just restate the proof of [Va2, 6.7.2].\n2.3.9. Theorem. Let (f, L(p) , v) be a SHS. We consider the context and notations\nof 2.3.4. We have:\na) G\u0303 is an inner form of GW (k) ; moreover G\u0303ab is a split torus.\n148\n\n\fb) The reductive group G\u0303 splits over a finite Galois cover Spec(W (k1 )) of Spec(W (k))\nof order dividing a fixed power of qGad . Moreover, the Galois group Gal(k1 /k) is nilpotent\nof index of nilpotency at most two. If for each simple factor (Gj , Xj ) of (Gad , X ad ) of\nDnR type with n \u2208 2N, n \u2265 6, the semisimple subgroups of Gder\nC naturally isogeneous to a\nsimply factor of GjC , are simply connected, then this Galois group is abelian.\nc) If all factors of Gad are of Cn or An Lie type for some n \u2208 N, and if for any simple\nder\nfactor G\u2032Q of Gad\nQ of An Lie type, the semisimple subgroup of GQ naturally isogeneous\nto it is a simply connected semisimple group, then G\u0303 is isomorphic to GW (k) , regardless\nof the choice of the W (k)-valued point z of N .\nd) If Gder is a simply connected semisimple group, then the Galois group of b) is\nabelian of exponent 2.\nProof: For the sake of future references, we index the main paragraphs by capital\nletters.\nA. Let N \u2208 N with (N, p) = 1. As (A, PA ) has level-N symplectic similitude\nstructure, so does (Ak , pAk ). So the N -th roots of unity are contained in k. We conclude:\nk \u2283 F = k(v). So also B(k) \u2283 B(F). The Proposition is a consequence of this last\ninclusion and of Fontaine's comparison theory. We present the instructive details. We\nrecall that:\nTheorem. Let q be a prime. Any Hodge cycle of an abelian variety over the field of\nfractions F R of a complete DVR of mixed characteristic (0, q) having a perfect residue\nfield, is a de Rham cycle, i.e. under the isomorphism of the de Rham conjecture, its de\nRham component is mapped into the q-component of its \u00e9tale component.\nThe case when the abelian variety is definable over a number field contained in F R,\nthis result was known since long time (for instance, see [Bl, (0.3)]). This extra hypothesis\nwas removed in [Va2, 5.2.16] (in the part of [Va2, 5.2] preceding [Va2, 5.2.16] an odd\nprime is used; however the proof of loc. cit. applies to all primes).\nB. As G is unramified over Qp , GB(F) is a split group. So GW (k) is a split group.\nFontaine's comparison theory implies G\u0303B(k) is an inner form of GB(k) (cf. Theorem of\nA). But G\u0303 splits over a finite \u00e9tale extension of W (k). So over this extension it becomes\nisomorphic to GW (k) , cf. the uniqueness of a split reductive group associated to a given\nroot datum (see [SGA3, Vol. III, p. 313-4]). As Gad\nW (k) (W (k)) is that maximal bounded\nad\nsubgroup of Gad\nW (k) (B(k)) (see [Ti2, 3.2]) which normalizes Lie(GW (k) ), we get: any\nautomorphism of GW (k) which generically is inner, is inner. We deduce: G\u0303 is an inner\nform of GW (k) . So G\u0303ab is a split torus. This takes care of a).\nC. Now we prove simultaneously the other parts. Any element of T (L\u2217(p) [ p1 ]) fixed\nby GQp gives birth (cf. the identification of [Va2, top of p. 473]) through Fontaine's\ncomparison theory to an element of T (M [ p1 ]) fixed by G\u0303 (again cf. Theorem of A; as we\nare over W (k) we can use as well Fontaine's comparison theory in a purely crystalline\ncontext). As B(k) \u2283 B(F), we can use B(F)-linear combinations of such elements. We\n149\n\n\fdenote by\nFix(GB(F) )\nthe set of tensors of T (L\u2217(p) \u2297Z(p) B(F)) fixed by GB(F) . So any element of Fix(GB(F) ) has a\ncounterpart in T (M [ p1 ]). As GB(F) is a split group and all simple Lie factors of Lie(Gad\nB(F) )\nare classical, split, simple Lie algebras over B(F), we can often \"capture\" the fact that\nGB(F) is split by just using the set Fix(GB(F) ). The most useful elements of Fix(GB(F) )\nare its projectors: they single out different subrepresentations of the representation of\nGB(F) on T (L\u2217(p) \u2297Z(p) B(F)) which can \"encode\" useful information on Gder\nB(F) .\nD. We first assume that:\nad\nad\n(*) for any simple factor AD of Gad\nB(F) \"coming\" from a simple factor of (G , X ) of An\n(n \u2208 N, n \u2265 2) or DnR type (n \u2208 2N, n \u2265 6), the semisimple subgroup SSS of Gder\nB(F)\nnaturally isogeneous to it, is simply connected and the representation of GB(F) on\nL\u2217(p) \u2297Z(p) B(F) does contain a subrepresentation WSSS (not necessarily irreducible)\non which the connected component of the origin of Z(GB(F) ) acts as multiplication\nwith scalars and on which Gder\nB(F) acts through a quotient of it which is naturally\nisomorphic to SSS.\n\nThe image of GB(F) in GL(WSSS ) is a reductive group GSSS which has a quotient\nQG which is either a GLn+1 -group or is a GSO(2n)-group. From [De4, 3.1 (a)] we\ndeduce that the classical representation of QG (defined as in 2.2.23 B) \"shows up\" as\na subrepresentation of GSSS on T (WSSS ) factoring through QG. From this, Weyl's\ncomplete reductibility theorem, the structure of the irreducible representations of a direct\nsum of absolutely simple, split, semisimple Lie algebras over B(F), and the fact that the\nirreducible subrepresentations of the representation of a simple Lie factor of Lie(Gad\nB(F) )\n\u2217\non L(p) \u2297Z(p) B(F) are given by minimal weights (see [Sa] or [De2, p. 261]) we deduce:\nFact. For any simple factor g0 of Lie(Gad\nB(F) ), we can single out a subrepresentation\nad\n\u2217\nof the representation of Lie(GB(F) ) on T (L(p) \u2297Z(p) B(F)) which is the tensor product T P\nof the classical faithful representation (viewed as a monomorphism) g0 \u0592\u2192 End(W0 ) (over\nB(F); for its complex version we refer to [He, \u00a78 of ch. 3]) with other representations\nof the same type of the other simple factors of Lie(Gad\nB(F) ), just by using (a projector of )\nFix(GB(F) ); moreover, the bilinear form (if it is not zero, then it is non-degenerate and\nunique up to a non-zero scalar) b0 on W0 annihilated by g0 (if g0 is of An Lie type,\nn \u2208 N \\ {1}, then this bilinear form is zero), gives birth to a bilinear form on T P fixed\nby Gder\nB(F) and normalized by GB(F) . If g0 = Lie(AD), then T P = W0 .\nAs G\u0303 is an inner form of GW (k) , all simple factors of G\u0303ad are absolutely simple\nfactors. From the Fact and Fontaine's comparison theory, we get the existence of an\nabsolutely simple factor g\u03030 of Lie(G\u0303ad\nB(k) ), which is an inner form of g0 and which has a\nfaithful representation on W\u03030 := W0 \u2297B(F) B(k), annihilating a bilinear form b\u03030 on W\u03030 .\nb\u03030 is a non-degenerate form iff the Lie type of g0 is not An , with n \u2208 N, n \u2265 2. We\n150\n\n\frecall that the dual of a tensor product of representations is the tensor product of the\ndual representations.\nWe now treat the case when all factors of Gad are of some An or Cn Lie type\n(n \u2208 N). By reasons of dimensions (resp. due to the existence of the alternating nondegenerate form b\u03030 ) in case g0 is of An (resp. of Cn ) Lie type, we get: g\u03030 is isomorphic\nto g0 \u2297B(F) B(k). We deduce g\u03030 is a split Lie algebra over B(k). So G\u0303der is a split group.\nSo (cf. a)) G\u0303 is a split group. As G\u0303B(k) and GB(k) are both split and inner forms of each\nother, they are isomorphic. We conclude (as in B): G\u0303 is isomorphic to GW (k) . This ends\nthe proof of c) under the assumption (*).\nE. Coming back to the general situation (of the assumption (*)), it is enough to\nshow: if b\u03030 is a non-degenerate symmetric form (i.e. if g0 is of Bn or Dn Lie type), then\ng\u03030 and g0 \u2297B(F) B(k) become isomorphic to each other over a finite, unramified abelian\nextension B(k1 ) of B(k) of order a divisor of 2N(W0 ) , where N (W0 ) \u2208 N depends only on\nm := dimB(F) (W0 ).\nTo see this, let G\u03030 be a semisimple group over W (k) whose generic fibre is the\nconnected component of the origin of O(W\u03030 , b\u03030 ) = Aut(W\u03030 , b\u03030 ). Its existence is implied\nby the fact that G\u0303 is a reductive group. It is enough to show that G\u03030k splits over a\nfinite abelian extension k1 of k whose Galois group is a 2-torsion group of whose order is\nbounded in terms of m. We consider a W (k)-lattice L\u03030 of W\u03030 such that G\u03030 is a closed\nsubgroup of GL(L\u03030 ), cf. [Ja, 10.4 of Part I] and [Va2, 3.1.2.1 c)]. The existence of b\u03030\nimplies (very easy exercise; see also the general result in [Ja, 10.9 of Part I]) the existence\nof a non-degenerate, symmetric bilinear form on L\u03030 /pL0 fixed by G\u03030k . With respect to\nsomeP\nk-basis of L\u03030 /pL0 , the quadratic form of this new bilinear form, can be written as a\nm\nsum i=1 ai x2i , where ai 's are non-zero elements of k. We get: G\u03030k splits over the abelian\nextension k1 of k obtained by adjoining square roots of not more than [ m\n2 ] elements of k.\n]\n[m\nSo [k1 : k]|2 2 . This ends the proof of b) and d) under the assumption (*).\nF. To prove b), c) and d) in general we use the standard techniques of [Va2, 6.2.3.1,\n6.2.3, 6.4.2 and 6.4.5.1] (for the case p = 3 cf. \u00a76). In other words, cf. 2.3.6 and loc. cit.,\nthere is another SHS (f 1 , L1(p) , v 1 ) such that:\n\u2013 the adjoint quadruples of Shimura quadruples (G1 , X 1 , H 1 , v 1 ) and (G, X, H, v)\nare isomorphic;\n\u2013 (*) is satisfied for it (for its last part pertaining to subrepresentations cf. also\n[Va2, 6.5.1.1 and 6.6.5]: they rely on [De2, proof of 2.3.10] and for loc. cit. it is obviously\nsatisfied);\n\u2013 there is a natural isogeny G1der \u2192 Gder .\nFor this new SHS we use the standard notations, except that we put an upper right\nindex 1 everywhere. As k is an F-algebra, from [Va2, 6.2.3 and 3.2.7 10)] we get: we can\n1\n1\nassume that each connected component of NW\n(k) /H0 is an abelian cover of a connected\ncomponent of NW (k) /H0 . Moreover, we can assume that the degree d(H0 , H01 ) of this\ncover divides a fixed power of qGad (cf. [Va2, 6.2.3.1]) and that all Hodge cycles of A1\n151\n\n\fare as well Hodge cycles of A1H 1 . So the standard trick of using Segre's embeddings as in\n0\n[Va2, Example 3 of 2.5] (it is fully recalled in 4.9 below; here we need just the rational\nversion of 4.9.3-4 below and so from 4.9.2.0 only its C part is needed), allows us to shift\nour attention to the new SHS; by doing this we might need to replace W (k) by W (k1 ),\nwhere k1 is an abelian extension of k of degree a divisor of d(H0 , H01 ). But for the new\nsituation we can apply the last paragraph of D and E. So we get b), c) and d), as the\npart of b) involving nilpotency is entirely trivial. This ends the proof of the Theorem.\n2.3.9.1. Remark. We do not know precisely for which SHS (f, L(p) , v) the reductive\ngroup G\u0303 of 2.3.4 is automatically isomorphic to GW (k) . The fixed power of qGad referred\nin 2.3.9 b) is effectively computable, as the degree d(H0 , H01 ) is effectively computable\n(over C).\nIf Gder is a simply connected semisimple group, then the Galois group of 2.3.9 b)\nis the product of at most r(Gad ) copies of Z/2Z. Here r(Gad ) is a sum indexed by the\nsimple factors of Gad\nC of Bn or Dn Lie type (like the term of the sum corresponding to a\nSO(2, m)ad\nfactor\nis\n[ m+2\nC\n2 ], etc.).\n2.3.9.2. Convention. From now on, for the sake of simplifying the notations, we\nassume that whenever we consider a point Spec(k) \u2192 N or a point Spec(W (k)) \u2192 N ,\nthe reductive group G\u0303 we get as in 2.3.4 is (isomorphic to) the split group GW (k) . This\nconvention is motivated by 2.3.9 and 2.3.9.1. It does not apply to the similar type of\npoints of a quotient of N (like N /H0 ).\n2.3.10. Shimura crystals attached to points of N . Let (f, L(p) , v) be a SHS.\nWe use the notations of 2.3.4 (with G\u0303 = GW (k) ). Let \u03c3 := \u03c3k . Let \u03c6 be the Frobenius\n1\nendomorphism of M = Hcrys\n(A/W (k)). For future references, we state here explicitly as\na Corollary, part of 2.3.9 A and C.\nCorollary. We have \u03c6(t\u03b1 ) = t\u03b1 , \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 J \u2032 .\nWarning: once we know N is smooth, the Corollary follows as well from the previous\nsh\nforms of the Theorem of 2.3.9 A, as one can check using a density argument of O(v)\n-valued\npoints of N .\nMoreover, t\u03b1 is a tensor of the F 0 -filtration of T (M [ p1 ]) defined by the Hodge\nfiltration F 1 of M defined by A. So the triple (M, \u03c6, GW (k) ) (resp. the quadruple\n(M, F 1 , \u03c6, GW (k) )) is (cf. 2.2.8 1) and 2)) a Shimura (resp. a Shimura filtered) \u03c3crystal, called the Shimura (resp. the Shimura filtered) \u03c3-crystal attached to the point\ny : Spec(k) \u2192 Nk(v) defined by z (resp. attached to z).\nWe deduce (see c) of 2.2.8 1)) the existence of an injective cocharacter \u03bc\u0303 : Gm \u0592\u2192\nGW (k) such that we have a direct sum decomposition M = F 1 \u2295 F 0 with \u03b2 \u2208 Gm (W (k))\nacting through \u03bc\u0303 on F i as the multiplication with \u03b2 \u2212i , i = 0, 1. Another proof of the\nexistence of such a cocharacter \u03bc\u0303 can be obtained by entirely following the construction\nof a cocharacter in [Va2, 5.3.1], as 2.3.9.2 tells us that GW (k) is split.\nAlso, either from loc. cit. or from the proof of Fact 2 of 2.2.9 3), we deduce that\nif the cardinality of W (k) as a set is not greater than the one of C, then for any O(v) 152\n\n\fmonomorphism W (k) \u0592\u2192 C, \u03bc\u0303C is G(C)-conjugate to the cocharacters \u03bc\u2217x , x \u2208 X, of\n2.3.1.\nWhen we want to emphasize the family of tensors (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J \u2032 then we also write\ndown (M, \u03c6, GW (k), (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J \u2032 ) and (M, F 1 , \u03c6, GW (k) , (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J \u2032 ). We also speak about the\nShimura (adjoint) Lie \u03c3-crystal attached to y, about the Shimura (adjoint) filtered Lie\n\u03c3-crystal attached to z, about the Shimura (adjoint) (Lie) isocrystal attached to y, and\nabout the Shimura (adjoint) filtered (Lie) isocrystal attached to z (cf. 2.2.13 and 2.2.13.2).\nWhen we want to emphasize the principal polarization pA , we speak about the\nprincipally quasi-polarized Shimura (resp. Shimura filtered) \u03c3-crystal attached to y (resp.\nto z) and denote it by (M, \u03c6, GW (k) , pA ) or by (M, \u03c6, GW (k) , (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J \u2032 , pA ) (resp. by\n(M, F 1 , \u03c6, GW (k) , pA ) or by (M, \u03c6, GW (k) , (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J \u2032 , pA )).\nWe consider now a morphism z : Spec(W (k)) \u2192 N /H0 , with k a perfect field. Let\n(A, pA ) := z \u2217 (AH0 , PAH0 ). Over a finite, \u00e9tale extension W (k1 ) of W (k), AW (k1 ) gets\nnaturally a family (w\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J \u2032 of Hodge cycles (see 2.3.3). As the set of all Hodge cycles\nof AW (k1 ) is invariant under the Galois group Gal(W (k1 )/W (k)) = Gal(k1 /k), we get\nthat the principally quasi-polarized filtered \u03c3-crystal (M, F 1 , \u03c6, pA ) attached to (A, pA )\nhas a natural structure of a principally quasi-polarized quasi Shimura filtered \u03c3-crystal\n(M, F 1 , \u03c6, G\u0303W (k) , pA ) which is not necessarily quasi-split. Argument: we take G\u0303W (k) to\nbe the Zariski closure in GL(M ) of the subgroup of GL(M \u2297W (k) B(k)) whose extension\nto B(k1 ) is the subgroup of GL(M \u2297W (k) B(k1 )) fixing the de Rham component of w\u03b1 ,\n\u2200\u03b1 \u2208 J \u2032 ; b) and c) of 2.2.8 1) hold, as they hold after this extension, and moreover a)\nholds (cf. Corollary) after this extension. Warning: we have no reason to consider G\u0303W (k)\nto be an inner form of GW (k) . However, if it is an inner form and if k is finite, then we\nhave G\u0303W (k) = GW (k) (cf. Lang's theorem applied over k).\nThis allows us to speak about the not necessarily quasi-split Shimura \u03c3-crystal or\nabout the Shimura (adjoint) Lie \u03c3-crystal or isocrystal attached to a point of N /H0\nwith values in a perfect field, and about the not necessarily quasi-split Shimura filtered\n\u03c3-crystal or Shimura (adjoint) filtered Lie \u03c3-crystal or isocrystal attached to a point of\nN /H0 with values in the Witt ring of such a field. Warning: all of them depend on the\nchoice of AH0 .\n2.3.10.1. Comment. Shimura Lie \u03c3-crystals attached to points y : Spec(k) \u2192\nNk(v) play a central role in \u00a71-14. We can not refrain from commenting why they have\nnot been used before. We think that mainly due to two reasons. The first reason is: in\nthe case of special fibres of integral canonical models of Siegel modular varieties, all the\ninformation provided by the Shimura Lie \u03c3-crystal attached to such a point, can be read\nout directly from the principally quasi-polarized Shimura \u03c3-crystal \"producing it\". The\nsecond reason is: the way of thinking of points of Nk(v) was mainly rational, i.e. was\ninvolving an analysis of the Shimura isocrystals defined by Shimura \u03c3-crystals attached\nto these points, even though for standard PEL situations (see [Ko2, ch. 5] and 2.3.5) was\nobvious (cf. [Va2, 4.3.11]; see also [LR] and [Ko2]) that \"we get\" Shimura \u03c3-crystals.\n2.3.10.2. Example. We consider a special point Spec(B(k)) \u2192 N (see def. [Va2,\n2.10]); as N has the extension property (see [Va2, 3.2.3 3) and 6)]), we get that it extends\n153\n\n\fto a morphism z1 : Spec(W (k)) \u2192 N . As F is a subfield of k (see 2.3.9 A), and as we\nare dealing with special points, we can assume k = F. So, following the proof of 2.2.18\nwe get: the Shimura filtered \u03c3-crystal attached to z1 is cyclic diagonalizable.\n2.3.11. Some simple properties. Let (f, L(p) , v) be a SHS. All the local deformation theory presented in [Va2, 5.4] can be applied for it (for N ), cf. the reductiveness\nproperty expressed in 2.3.4. In particular, the fact that N is the normalization of the\nZariski closure of ShH (G, X) in M, results also from [Va2, 5.4-5] (see [Va2, 5.4.8 and\n5.5]).\nWe have variants of [Va2, 5.4]: we work over an arbitrary perfect field k (instead\nof F), or we work with G0W (k) (instead of Gder\nW (k) ), or we work with N /H0 (instead of\nN , i.e. we work with a finite level symplectic similitude structure, instead of all level-N\nsymplectic similitude structures, N \u2208 N, (N, p) = 1). This is so due to the fact that [Fa2,\nth. 10] is true for any perfect field. Here we just state one such form of these variants. We\nconsider a point z \u2208 NW (k) (W (k)). Let (M, F 1 , \u03c6, GW (k) , (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J , pM ) be its attached\nprincipally quasi-polarized Shimura filtered \u03c3-crystal. We have:\nTheorem. There are formally smooth W (k)-morphisms from the completion G\u0303 of\nin its origin into NW (k) such that:\n\nGder\nW (k)\n\n\u2013 the origin of G\u0303 is mapped into z;\n\u2013 the principally quasi-polarized filtered F -crystal with tensors over G\u0303k defined naturally (via pull back) by (A, PA ) and its natural family of (de Rham components of )\nHodge cycles, is isomorphic to a principally quasi-polarized Shimura filtered F -crystal of\nthe form\n \u0303\n(M, F 1 , \u03c6, GW (k) , Gder\nW (k) , f , (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J , pM )\nunder an isomorphism which in z is the natural identification of (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G) with itself.\nFrom [Va2, 5.4.8] we get (as in [Va2, 5.5]):\nCorollary. The finite W (k)-morphism NW (k) \u2192 MW (k) defined by iN is a formal\nembedding in each k-valued point of NW (k) .\nWe consider now the locally free ON /H0 -sheaf\n1\nLH0 := RdR\n(AH0 /N /H0 )\n\nof rank 2e. PAH0 makes it to be naturally equipped with a perfect alternating form \u03c8LH0 .\nLet L be the pull back of LH0 to N . We have:\n1\nL = RdR\n(A/N ).\n\nThe essential tensor algebra T (LE(G,X) ) of the direct sum of the pull back of L to NE(G,X)\nand of the dual of it, comes equipped with a family of sections (tA\n\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J \u2032 defined by the\nA\n\u2032\nde Rham components of the family of Hodge cycles (w\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J of A. Let\nGN\n154\n\n\fbe the Zariski closure in GL(L) of the subgroup of GL(LE(G,X) ) fixing these sections.\nWorking in the faithfully flat topology, from Theorem we get:\nFact 1. GN is a reductive subgroup of GL(L).\nLet now H1 be a normal, open subgroup of H0 such that GN is obtained from a\nsubgroup of GL(LH1 ) by pull back via the quotient morphism N \u2192 N /H1 ; here LH1\nis the pull back of LH0 via the quotient morphism i10 : N /H1 \u2192 N /H0 . We assume\nthat all the sections of T (LE(G,X) ) we have considered are obtained by pull back from\nsections of the pull back of T (LH1 ) to the generic fibre of N /H1 (i.e. we assume H1 is\nsmall enough). As the quotient morphism N /H1 \u2192 N /H0 is an \u00e9tale cover and we can\nassume that the finite group H0 /H1 permutes the (pull back to generic points of N /H1\nof the) last family of sections, we get (see also 2.3.10):\nFact 2. GN is obtained by pull back from a reductive subgroup GN /H0 of GL(LH0 ).\nWe consider the principally quasi-polarized p-divisible object\n(LH0 , pLH0 )\n\u2207\nof MF[0,1]\n(NW (k(v)) /H0 ) corresponding to the principally quasi-polarized p-divisible\ngroup\n(DH0 , PDH0 )\n\nof (AH0 , PAH0 ). The underlying O(NW (k(v)) /H0 )\u2227 -sheaf of LH0 is the p-adic completion\nof LH0 , while its connection is the p-adic completion of the Gauss\u2013Manin connection on\nLH0 defined by AH0 . From Fact 2 and 2.2.20.1 9) applied to i\u221710 (LH0 ) and from Corollary\nof 2.3.10 applied generically (in the context of i\u221710 (LH0 ), i.e. in the context of N /H1 ), we\n\u2207\nget: the End p-divisible object End(LH0 ) of MF[\u22121,1]\n(NW (k(v)) /H0 ) has a natural Lie\np-divisible subobject\nGH0 ,\nwhose underlying Lie O(NW (k(v)) /H0 )\u2227 -sheaf is the p-adic completion of the Lie algebra of\nGN /H0 . We conclude:\nFact 3. For any morphism U \u2192 N (resp. U \u2192 N /H1 ), with U a regular, formally\nsmooth scheme over a faithfully flat O(v) -algebra which is a DVR having a perfect residue\nfield and index of ramification 1, we get naturally a principally quasi-polarized Shimura\np-divisible group\n(DU , (tD\n\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J , pDU )\nover U .\nHere (DU , pDU ) is the principally quasi-polarized p-divisible group over U obtained\nby pulling back (DH0 , PDH0 ) via the composite morphism U \u2192 N /H0 , while the family\nof crystalline sections (tD\n\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J is naturally obtained from the mentioned sections of the\ngeneric fibre of T (LH1 ). The change of the original family of tensors (v\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J (for instance, if we work with J \u2032 instead of J ), corresponds to a passage to quasi-isomorphic\n155\n\n\fprincipally quasi-polarized Shimura p-divisible groups, cf. 2.2.20.1 7). We have a logical\nversion of Fact 3 in terms of F -crystals: such a version encompasses the part of 2.3.10\nreferring to 2.3.4.\nFrom 2.2.21 and the above first two paragraphs (referring to [Va2, 5.4-5]), we get:\nFact 4. If the morphism U \u2192 N /H1 identifies U with the completion of NW (k) /H1\nin a W (k)-valued point of it, then (DU , (tD\n\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J , pDU ) is a universal principally quasipolarized Shimura p-divisible group.\nThe pull back of (A, PA ) via an automorphism of N defined by the right translation\nwith an element of G(Apf ), gives birth to a principally polarized abelian scheme over N\nwhich is naturally Z(p) -isogeneous to (A, PA ) (see [Va2, p. 454]); strictly speaking, cf.\nloc. cit., for this statement we have to consider principal polarizations up to Gm (Z(p) )multiples. So we have a natural continuous right action of G(Apf ) on L, viewed as an\naffine scheme over N . This implies that L does not depend on the choice of a Z-lattice\nL of W as in 2.3.2. We can assume that under this action the considered global sections\nof LE(G,X) are permuted. We get (cf. also AE.4.2 a)):\nFact 5. Let H\u03030 be a compact subgroup of G(Apf ) such that either H\u03030 \u00d7 H is p-smooth\nfor (G, X) or p 6 |t(Gad ) and H\u03030 \u00d7 H is smooth for (G, X). Let LH\u03030 be the quotient of L\nunder the action of H\u03030 on it. Then in Fact 2 we can replace H0 by H\u03030 .\nFact 6. Under right translation by elements of G(Apf ), the Shimura (resp. Shimura\nfiltered) \u03c3-crystals attached\nto k-valued (resp. to W (k)-valued) points of N are the same.\n\u0001\nIf k = k\u0304 and if \u22121\n=\n\u22121,\nthen\nthe same holds in the principally quasi-polarized context.\np\n\u0001\n= \u22121, then\nFor the principally quasi-polarized context, we just need to add: if \u22121\np\n(as p \u2265 3) \u2200\u03b2 \u2208 G\u0001m (Zp ), either \u03b2 or \u2212\u03b2 is the square of an element of Gm (Zp ). So if\n= \u22121, then \u2200\u03b1N \u2208 Gm (Zp ), a principally quasi-polarized Shimura\nk = k\u0304 and if \u22121\np\n\u03c3-crystal (N, \u03c6N , GN , pN ) over k is isomorphic to (N, \u03c6N , GN , \u03b1N pN ) under a scalar\nautomorphism of N defined by an element of Gm (Zp ).\nLet now O1 be a local, formally \u00e9tale, faithfully flat O(v) -algebra such that the\nrepresentation of GO1 on L\u2217(p) \u2297Z(p) O1 is a direct sum of two non-zero subrepresentations.\nThis can be codified in terms of projectors which are O1 -linear combinations of Betti\ncomponents of Hodge cycles which are defined by endomorphisms of A. So, if these\nendomorphisms are obtained from endomorphisms of AH0 via pull back, we get:\nFact 7. The pull back of LH0 to NO1 /H0 gets naturally a direct sum decomposition\ninto two non-zero summands.\nFact 7 just points out a first property of the general theory of automorphic vector\nbundles in mixed characteristic, whose elaboration will be started in \u00a75 (cf. end of 1.15).\n2.3.12. Some extra standard notations. We start with a closed point z :\nSpec(W (k)) \u0592\u2192 NW (k) /H0 . Let y : Spec(k) \u0592\u2192 Nk /H0 be defined by z. We use the\nnotations of 2.3.10. So F 1 is the Hodge filtration of M defined by A. For simplifying the\n156\n\n\fpresentation, we assume that the family of Hodge cycles (w\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J \u2032 of AW (k1 ) is definable\nover W (k) and that the group G\u0303W (k) of 2.3.10 is in fact (isomorphic to) GW (k) . We\ncan always achieve this by replacing k by a finite field extension k1 of it. Let Oy be\ncy are its henselization and respectively its completion.\nthe local ring of y. So Oyh and O\nLet (Ahy , pAhy ) be the principally polarized abelian scheme over Spec(Oyh ) obtained from\n(AH0 , PAH0 ) by pull back through the natural morphism Spec(Oyh ) \u2192 N /H0 . Let\n1\n(Ahy /Oyh ),\nMyh := HdR\n\nand let Fy1h be its Hodge filtration defined by Ahy .\nAs N is formally smooth over Z(p) , Oyh is an integral domain. Let Kyh be the field\nof fractions of Oyh . Let (w\u03b1h )\u03b1\u2208J \u2032 be the family of Hodge cycles with which AhyK h is\ny\nnaturally endowed: as we assumed that the family (w\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J \u2032 is defined over W (k), the\nfamily (w\u03b1h )\u03b1\u2208J \u2032 is defined over Oyh and not only over its strict henselization. This is a\nconsequence of the following obvious fact:\nFact. A Hodge cycle of a deformation which is 0 in a point is 0 (everywhere).\nLet th\u03b1 be the de Rham component of w\u03b1h . It is a homogeneous tensor of T (Myh \u2297Oyh\nKyh ).\n2.3.13. Lemma. There is an isomorphism fy : Myh \u2192M\n \u0303\n\u2297W (k) Oyh taking Fy1h onto\nF 1 \u2297W (k) Oyh , pAhy into pA , and th\u03b1 into t\u03b1 , \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 J \u2032 (here we view pAhy and pA as perfect\nforms on Myh and respectively on M \u2297W (k) Oyh ).\ncy , cf. Fact 4 of 2.3.11. The obstruction to\nProof: Such an isomorphism exists over O\nthe existence of fy is measured by an element \u03b3 \u2208 Hf1f (Oyh , PO0 h ); here P 0 is the parabolic\ny\n\nsubgroup of G0W (k) normalizing F 1 , while the lower right index f f refers to the faithfully\ncy . As Oyh is the henselization of the excellent ring\nflat topology. So \u03b3 becomes 0 over O\nOy , using Artin's approximation theorem we get \u03b3 = 0. This proves the Lemma.\n\n2.3.13.1. Corollary. There is an \u00e9tale morphism a : Y = Spec(R) \u2192 NW (k) /H0\nto which the point y lifts, and there is an isomorphism MR \u2192M\n \u0303\n\u2297W (k) R taking FR1 onto\n\u2032\n1\nR\nF 1 \u2297W (k) R, pAY into pA , and tR\n\u03b1 into t\u03b1 , \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 J (here MR , FR , (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J \u2032 , pAY have\n1\na meaning similar to the one in the case of Oyh ; for instance, MR := HdR\n(AY /R), where\nAY := AH0 \u00d7N /H0 Y , the morphism Y \u2192 N /H0 being naturally induced by a).\n2.3.13.2. Corollary. To check that 2.3.4 (*) holds, we just need to consider z \u2208\nN (W (F)).\n2.3.14. Warning: Sp or GSp? Once for all we have to decide if we use GSp(W, \u03c8)\nor Sp(W, \u03c8) (and so GW (k) or G0W (k) ). The use of Sp(W, \u03c8) corresponds to a permanent\nmentioning of polarizations (and so to a very precise presentation but more complicated\nnotations). The use of GSp(W, \u03c8) corresponds to a loose treatment of polarizations (and\n157\n\n\fso to a less precise presentation but simpler notations). We decided to go along with\nSp(W, \u03c8): this explains the form of 2.3.15 below.\nThe idea behind this comment is: we can work out [Va2, 5.4.4-5] using not only (the\nW (k)-versions of) Sp(W, \u03c8) and Gder (or of G0 ) but also (the W (k)-versions of) GSp\nand G. The use of GSp(W, \u03c8) means that the cycle of the polarization is not exactly\npA but pA times some invertible element up . To exemplify what we mean by this, we\nconsider a particular case: denoting by Spec(R1 ) the completion of GSp(M, pA ) in its\norigin, the natural universal element gR1 \u2208 GSp(M, pA )(R1 ) takes pA into \u03b3p pA , where\n\u03b3p \u2208 Gm (R1 ) is congruent to the identity modulo the ideal I1 of R1 defining the origin\nof Spec(R1 ). If \u03a6R1 is a Frobenius lift of R1 as in 2.2.10 (so it takes I1 into I1p ), then\nup \u2208 Gm (R1 ) and \u03b3p are related through the formula \u03a6R1 (up )\u03b3p = up . It is easy to see\nthat there is a unique such up which mod I1 is the identity.\nIn general, this element \u03b3p can be made to be the identity, by considering a square\nroot x of \u03b3p (as p > 2, x \u2208 R1 ); in our example involving R1 , the automorphism gx\u22121\nof M \u2297W (k) R1 defined by scalar multiplication with x\u22121 , \"brings back\" \u03b3p pA into pA .\nSo, to keep pA as the cycle of a principal quasi-polarization, we have to replace gR1 by\ngx\u22121 gR1 \u2208 Sp(M, pA )(R1 ).\nIn fact, due to the existence of the cocharacter \u03bc\u0303 of 2.3.10, in general, we can make\n\u03b3p to be the identity element without using that p is odd; for instance in the example\ninvolving R1 , instead of gx\u22121 we can use \u03bc\u0303(\u03b3p ) in order to bring back \u03b3p pA into pA .\nSo indeed the difference in the mentioned two choices is mostly of notations and of\npreciseness.\n2.3.15. Proposition. There is a smooth morphism a : Y = Spec(R) \u2192 NW (k) /H0\nsuch that:\na) The scheme a\u22121 (z) contains a W (k)-valued point z1 ;\nb) We have an isomorphism MR \u2192M\n \u0303 \u2297W (k) R taking FR1 onto F 1 \u2297W (k) R, pAY into\nR\n\u2032\n1\npA , and t\u03b1 into t\u03b1 , \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 J (here MR := HdR\n(AY /R), with AY defined as in 2.3.13.1,\netc.; the logical notations);\nc) There is a Frobenius lift \u03a6R of R\u2227 of the form zi \u2192 zip , i \u2208 I, where the elements\nof the subset {zi |i \u2208 I} of R are forming a regular system of parameters of z1 in Y ;\n\u2207\nd) Based on b), the p-divisible object C of MF[0,1]\n(R) associated to the p-divisible\n\u0001\n\u2227\n1\ngroup of AY , can be put in the form M \u2297W (k) R , F \u2297W (k) R\u2227 , gY (\u03c6\u22971), \u2207R\u2227 , with the\nperfect alternating form pA on M \u2297W (k) R\u2227 corresponding to pAY , with \u2207R\u2227 a connection\non M \u2297W (k) R\u2227 annihilating t\u03b1 , \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 J \u2032 , and with gY \u2208 G0W (k) (R\u2227 ) defined by a\nmorphism (still denoted by gY )\n\ngY : Y \u2227 \u2192 G0\u2227\nW (k) .\nMoreover, we can assume the special fibre of gY is \u00e9tale (so |I| = dimQ (G0Q )) and the\ncomposite of (the p-adic completion of ) z1 with gY defines the origin of G0\u2227\nW (k) .\n158\n\n\fProof: Let \u011c0 = Spec(R\u03020 ) be the completion of G0W (k) in its origin. As in [Va2,\n5.4.4] (see 2.3.11) we construct a formally smooth morphism\n\u00e2\n\n\u011c0 \u2192 NW (k) /H0\nsuch that z factors through the origin of \u011c0 and the principally quasi-polarized filtered\nF -crystal with tensors \u01080 associated to the principally quasi-polarized p-divisible group\nover \u011c0 obtained naturally from (DH0 , PDH0 ) (by pull back through the composite of\n\u00e2 with the natural morphism NW (k) /H0 \u2192 N /H0 ) and its natural family of de Rham\nsections (see Fact 3 of 2.3.11 and 2.3.12), is a principally quasi-polarized Shimura filtered\nF -crystal (M, F 1 , \u03c6, GW (k) , G0W (k) , f \u0303, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J \u2032 , pA ) (so z \u2217 (\u01080 ) is naturally identified with\n(M, F 1 , \u03c6, G, (t\u03b1)\u03b1\u2208J \u2032 )). Here f \u0303 : W (k)[[x1 , ..., x|I| ]]\u2192\n \u0303 R\u03020 is a W (k)-isomorphism. For\nthe part referring to formal smoothness, cf. also [Va2, 5.4.7-8].\nLet n \u2265 2 be an integer and let I be the ideal of R\u03020 defining the origin of \u011c0 (so\nR\u03020 /I = W (k)). Let (cf. Artin's approximation theorem) Y = Spec(R) be a smooth\nW (k)-scheme such that:\ni) there is a smooth morphism a : Y \u2192 NW (k) /H0 such that the point z lifts to a\npoint z1 : Spec(W (k)) \u2192 Y ;\nii) if I1 is the ideal of R defining z1 , the natural morphism Spec(R/I1n ) \u2192 NW (k) /H0\ndefined by a is obtained from the natural morphism Spec(R\u03020 /I n ) \u2192 NW (k) /H0 defined\nn\nby \u00e2 via a W (k)-isomorphism in : R\u03020 /I n \u2192R/I\n \u0303\n1.\nReplacing if needed Y with Y \u2032 = Spec(R\u2032 ), where Y \u2032 \u2192 Y is an \u00e9tale morphism\nsuch that z1 lifts to a W (k)-valued point of Y \u2032 , we can achieve (cf. 2.3.13.1) that the\nmorphism a endows the abelian scheme AY with a family of Hodge cycles (w\u03b1R )\u03b1\u2208J \u2032 and\nthat b) and c) are satisfied (here zi \u2208 R is such that in (f \u0303(xi )) is congruent to zi modulo\nI1n ).

Due the smoothness of P 0 over W (k), any element\nof P 0 (R/I1n ) congruent to the identity mod I1 , lifts, potentially after a replacement of Y\nwith an Y \u2032 as above, to an element of P 0 (R) and so to an element hcorr of P 0 (R\u2227 ). From\nproperty ii), by replacing gY (\u03c6 \u2297 1) by hcorr gY (\u03c6 \u2297 1)h\u22121\ncorr for a suitable such correction\nelement hcorr , we get that we can assume (simple argument at the level of tangent spaces)\nthat gY is defined by a W (k)-morphism gY : Y \u2227 \u2192 G0\u2227\nW (k) , \u00e9tale mod p and having the\nproperty that the composite of the p-adic completion of z1 with gY defines the origin of\nG0\u2227\nW (k) . This takes care of d) and ends the proof.\n159\n\n\fFrom the proof of 2.3.15, by removing extra regular parameters we get:\n2.3.15.1. Corollary.

Moreover, we can assume that:\n\u2013 the composite of (the p-adic completion of ) z\u03031 with g\u1ef8 defines the origin of G0\u2227\nW (k) ;\nb\u0303 of R\u0303 w.r.t. its ideal ((z ) ),\n\u2013 modulo the ideal J := p((zi )i\u2208I \u0303)2 of the completion R\ni i\u2208I \u0303\nb\u0303\ng\u1ef8 defines an isomorphism ISO from Spec(R/J) into the completion N\u0302 of a commutative, unipotent subgroup N of G0W (k) in its origin, taken modulo the ideal defined by\np times the second power of the ideal sheaf of N\u0302 defining its origin; N can be any\nsuch subgroup achieving an open embedding N \u0592\u2192 GW (k) /P (so g\u1ef8 mod p is a formal closed embedding in the special fibre \u1ef91 of z\u03031 ) and even more, if a Frobenius lift of\nN\u0302 = Spec(W (k)[[\u03c91 , ..., \u03c9dimC (X) ]]) taking \u03c9l to \u03c9lp , l = 1, dimC (X), is chosen, we can\nalso assume that such an isomorphism ISO is compatible with the Frobenius lifts;\ne) The special fibre of \u1ef8 is connected.\nThe c) of 2.3.15 (resp. of 2.3.15.1) is automatically satisfied by passing to a suitable\nopen, affine subscheme of Y (resp. of \u1ef8 ); it is included in order to state its following d)\naccurately.\n2.3.16. Corollary. There is an open, dense subscheme Uk of Gk such that: for any\ny1\ngeometric point Spec(k1 ) \u2192 Uk (with k1 = k1 \u2283 k), there is a point z1 \u2208 N /H0 (W (k1 )),\nlifting a k1 -valued point of the same connected component of Nk\u0304 /H0 through which the\npoint y \u25e6 ik factors, with ik : Spec(k\u0304) \u2192 Spec(k) as the natural morphism, and having the\nproperty that the Shimura filtered \u03c3k1 -crystal attached to it is isomorphic to M \u2297W (k)\n\u0001\n\u0001\nW (k1 ), F 1 \u2297W (k) W (k1 ), g1 (\u03c60 \u2297 1), GW (k1 ) , where g1 \u2208 GW (k) W (k1 ) mod p is (i.e.\ndefines) the point y1 .\nProof: Working with G0 instead of G, this is a direct consequence of 2.3.15: we\ncan take as Uk0 the image of the special fibre of Y \u2227 through the formally \u00e9tale morphism\n160\n\n\fgY : Y \u2227 \u2192 G0\u2227\nW (k) of 2.3.15; this can be read out from the existence of Teichm\u00fcller\nlifts Spec(W (k1 )) \u2192 Y \u2227 . Now, as Uk , we can take (cf. the Subfact of 2.3.11) an open\nsubscheme of Gk contained in the image of Uk0 \u00d7 Gm through the natural isogeny (see\n2.3.1) G0k \u00d7 Gm \u2192 Gk .\nThe argument for this (to be compared with 2.3.14) goes as follows: for any \u03b1 \u2208\nGm (W (k)), there is \u03b2 \u2208 Gm (W (k)) such that \u03b1 = \u03c3(\u03b2)\u03b2 \u22121 ; accordingly a Shimura \u03c3crystal (N, \u03c6N , GN ) over k is isomorphic to the Shimura \u03c3-crystal (N, \u03b1N \u03c6N , GN ), where\n\u03b1N is the automorphism of N defined by scalar multiplication with \u03b1. This proves the\nCorollary.\n2.3.16.1. Comment. Warning: by working with GW (k) and not with G0W (k) ,\nwe have to give up mentioning the principal quasi-polarizations; so the isomorphism\nof 2.3.16 is just of Shimura filtered \u03c3-crystals. For applications to problems involving\nNewton polygons or truncations of Shimura Lie F -crystals this is equally good. If we\nwant to keep track of the principal quasi-polarizations, we have to restate 2.3.16, with\nUk being replaced by Uk0 of its proof.\n2.3.17. Proposition. With the notations of 2.3.12, the Shimura filtered \u03c3-crystal\n(M, F11 , \u03c6, GW (k) ) attached to another lift z1 : Spec(W (k)) \u0592\u2192 NW (k) /H0 of y, satisfies\nF11 = g(F 1 ),\nwith g \u2208 GW (k) (W (k)) such that mod p it normalizing F 1 /pF 1 . Conversely, for any such\ng there is a unique lift zg : Spec(W (k)) \u0592\u2192 NW (k) of y, whose attached Shimura filtered\n\u03c3-crystal is (M, g(F 1 ), \u03c6, GW (k)).\nProof: As the parabolic subgroups of GW (k) normalizing F 1 and respectively F11\nare having the same special fibre, the first statement follows from Fact 2 of 2.2.9 3)\napplied in the context of the canonical split cocharacters (they factor through GW (k) )\nof (M, F 1 , \u03c6) and of (M, F11 , \u03c6). Also we would like to point out, that the approach\nof [Va2, 5.3.1] represents another way to see that these two parabolic subgroups are\nGW (k) (W (k))-conjugate.\nThe converse is a direct consequence of the smoothness of GW (k) and of NW (k) , of\nthe Corollary of 2.3.11 (or of Fact 4 of 2.3.11) and of the local deformation theory of\nabelian varieties (over k) (see also the existence of the isomorphism F IL0 of 2.4 below).\nThis proves the Proposition.\n2.3.17.1. Corollary. Let g \u2208 GW (k) (W (k)) be such that mod p it normalizes\nF /pF 1 \u2282 M/pM . Then the principally quasi-polarized Shimura filtered \u03c3-crystal\n(M, g(F 1), \u03c6, GW (k) , pA ) is induced from the principally quasi-polarized Shimura filtered\nF-crystal\n(M, F 1 , \u03c6, GW (k) , G0W (k) , f \u0303, pA )\n1\n\n(of the proof of 2.3.15) through a W (k)-epimorphism R\u03020 \u0589 W (k).\nThe 2.2.21 UP suggests (to be compared with 3.12 below) variants of this Corollary,\nwhere we replace G0W (k) by suitable smooth subschemes of GW (k) containing the origin.\n161\n\n\f2.3.17.2. Exercise. Show that 2.3.17.1 is a property of (principally quasi-polarized)\nShimura \u03c3-crystals over a perfect field k of characteristic p \u2265 3. Hint one: just look at\n2.4 below and use 2.2.21 UP. Hint two: if we feel more comfortable with the context of\nprincipally polarized abelian schemes, first assume k = k\u0304 and follow the (independent)\nideas of 4.12.12 and 4.12.12.0 or just 4.12.12.5 below, and then use Galois descent.\n2.3.18. The p = 2 SHS. The case p = 2 presents some particular features and so\nwe felt it is appropriate to single it aside.\nA. Working with p = 2, we can keep 2.3.1-2. But for 2.3.3 we have to assume N\nexists: the proof of [Va2, 3.2.12] still applies (via [Va2, 3.4.1]) to give us that N is the\nZariski closure of the normalization of ShH (G, X) in M (cf. 2.2.1.5.1). 2.3.3.1 needs no\nmodification. In connection to N ad (resp. to N ab ) of 2.3.3.2 we refer to 4.14.3.2.3 below\n(resp. to [Va2, 3.2.8]).\nWe keep 2.3.4-5 but we prefer to abbreviate the things differently: the resulting\ntriple (f, L(2) , v) (resp. quadruple (f, L(2) , v, B)) is referred to as a p = 2 SHS (resp. as a\np = 2 standard PEL situation). All of 2.3.6.1 makes sense for p = 2. 2.3.5.1 remains true\nfor p = 2 as its hint does, while 2.3.5.3 makes sense for p = 2 as well (cf. also B below).\nRelated to Fact 1 of 2.3.5.2, we define N j to be the normalization of the Zariski closure\nof ShH j (Gj , X j ) in N . The fact that N j is smooth, \u2200j \u2208 F (Gad , X ad ), is proved in the\nsame manner as for the A and C cases of a p = 2 standard PEL situation (this is reviewed\nin B below): GjZ(2) is the centralizer of a torus T of GZ(2) and so we have a relative PEL\nsituation (in the sense of [Va2, 4.3.16]; see also [Va2, 4.3.14]); so one just needs to combine\n[Va2, 4.3.13] (applied in the context of the monomorphisms T \u0592\u2192 GZ(2) \u0592\u2192 GL(L(2) )),\nwith the Steps B4-10 of B below (i.e. with the fact that (f, L(2) , v) is a p = 2 SHS and\nwith the deformation theory of endomorphisms of abelian schemes). Related to Fact 2 of\n2.3.5.2 and to the part of 2.3.5.5 pertaining to qN1 , we refer to 4.14.3.2.3. 2.3.5.4 needs no\nmodifications (as 2.2.1.5.1 handles the case p = 2 as well). Except the mentioned part of\n2.3.5.5, 2.3.5.5-6 and 2.3.5.6.1 A need no extra comment; the fact that 2.3.5.6.1 B holds\nfor p = 2 is implied by the Theorem of B below. However, we postpone to \u00a76 and [Va5]\n(resp. to 4.14.3.2) for a p = 2 analogue of 2.3.5.7 (resp. of 2.3.5.8 and of 2.3.5.8.1).\nB. The fact that 2.3.8 4) has a p = 2 analogue is just partially documented in the\nliterature; for instance, in [Ko2] (see end of p. 391 of loc. cit.) the so called D case is\navoided for p = 2. The following Theorem fills out this gap in the literature and so it\nprovides (via Lemma 2 of 4.6.4 below) the first new instances of p = 2 SHS's.\nTheorem. We consider a quadruple (f, L(2) , v, B) which satisfies all properties of a\np = 2 standard PEL situation, except the fact that (f, L(2) , v) is a p = 2 SHS. Then the\ntriple (f, L(2) , v) is a p = 2 SHS, and so the quadruple (f, L(2) , v, B) is a p = 2 standard\nPEL situation.\nProof: If G is a torus, then the Theorem is easy: it is a consequence of [Va2, 4.3.13]\n(cf. also [Va2, 3.2.8 and 3.3.2]). From now on we assume G is not a torus. We itemize\nthe ideas by numbers attached to B.\n162\n\n\fB1. We define N \u2032 (resp. N ) to be the Zariski closure (resp. the normalization of the\nZariski closure) of ShH (G, X) in M. Let (A, PA ) be defined as usual. In what follows,\nnot to complicate the notations we still denote by B the set of Z(2) -endomorphisms with\nwhich A is naturally endowed and so, with which any abelian scheme obtained from A by\npull back is endowed. Let B1 be the centralizer of B in End(L(2) ). Let \u2217 be the involution\nof B or of B1 defined by \u03c8. Till the end of 2.3.18, we use orderings of the form (A, PA , B)\ninstead of usual orderings of the form (A, B, PA ).\nB2. Let n \u2208 N, n \u2265 4. We consider the group scheme Dn1 over Z(2) fixing a quadratic\nform QF := x1 x2 + ... + x2n\u22121 x2n in 2n independent variables. It is known (see [Bo2,\n23.6] for the picture over F2 ) that the group Dn over Z(2) defined as the Zariski closure\nof the connected component of the origin of the generic fibre of Dn1 in Dn1 , is a split,\nsemisimple group of Dn Lie type. So we get a 2n dimensional faithful representation\n\u03c1n : Dn \u0592\u2192 GL(Z2n\n(2) );\nit is associated to the minimal weight \u03c91 (see [De2] and [Bou2, planche IV]). Its special\nfibre is absolutely irreducible (simple argument at the level of dimensions) and (cf. [Bo2,\n23.6]) it is alternating; so the perfect, symmetric bilinear form BF on Ln := Z2n\n(2) fixed\nby Dn (and naturally defined by QF ; it is unique up to multiplication with an invertible\nelement of Z(p) ), when taken mod 2 is alternating. We have:\nCorollary. Let R be a reduced, faithfully flat Z(2) -algebra. Let MR be a free Rsubmodule of Ln \u2297Z(2) R[ 21 ] of rank 2n and such that we get a perfect bilinear form BF :\nMR \u2297R MR \u2192 R (so MR [ 21 ] = Ln \u2297Z(2) R[ 21 ]). If the Zariski closure Dn (R) of Dn R[ 12 ] in\nGL(MR ) is a semisimple group, then BF restricted to MR /2MR is alternating.\nProof: Localizing in the \u00e9tale topology, we can assume Dn (R) is split and R is local.\nWe consider a Borel subgroup BR of Dn R and a maximal torus TR of BR . Applying\n[SGA3, Vol. III, 1.5 of p. 329] over R[ 21 ], we get that we can assume TR[ 12 ] and BR[ 12 ]\nextend to a torus and respectively to a Borel subgroup of Dn (R). Based on [SGA3, p.\n313-4 and 1.3 of p. 328] we deduce that we can assume Dn (R) = Dn R . But this implies\nthat 2q(MR ) MR = Ln \u2297Z(2) R, for some q(MR ) \u2208 Z (this can be checked immediately\nstarting from the decompositions of MR and of Ln \u2297Z(2) R in irreducible TR -modules and\nthe fact that \u03c1n mod 2 is irreducible). As BF restricted to MR and to Ln \u2297Z(2) R are\nperfect, we get q(MR ) = 0 and the Corollary follows.\nWe also get that the involution of B1 \u2297Z(2) F has all its simple factors (i.e. the\ninvolutions restricted to simple factors of B1 \u2297Z(2) F left invariant by \u2217 or to products of\ntwo such simple factors permuted by \u2217) are either of second type or of alternating first\ntype. We refer to this property as the ALT property.\nParts a) and b) of the following Exercise complement parts of [Ko2] (like 7.2-3 of loc.\ncit., etc.). a) can be viewed as a converse of the Corollary (in our geometric context).\nB3. Exercise. Let R be a local Z(2) -algebra such that B \u2297Z(2) R is a product of\nmatrix R-algebras. Let mR be the maximal ideal of R; we assume R/mR has characteristic 2. Let \u03c81 : L(2) \u2297Z(2) L(2) \u2297Z(2) R \u2192 R be a perfect alternating form such that\n163\n\n\fB \u2297Z(2) R is self dual w.r.t. it and the resulting involution of B \u2297Z(2) R is the same as the\none defined by \u03c8. We assume the involution of B1 \u2297Z(2) R/2R induced by \u03c81 has all its\nfactors (in the same sense as above) either of second type or of alternating first type. We\nhave:\na) We assume R is a reduced, flat Z(2) -algebra. Then, the Zariski closure G\u0303R\nin GL(L(2) \u2297Z(2) R) of the connected component of the origin of the subgroup of\nGSp(L(2) \u2297Z(2) R[ 21 ], \u03c81 ) fixing the elements of B, is reductive.\nb) We assume R is a complete DVR of mixed characteristic (0,2) and with an\nalgebraically closed residue field. We also assume the triples (L(2) \u2297Z(2) R, \u03c81 , B \u2297Z(2) R)\nand (L(2) \u2297Z(2) R, \u03c8, B \u2297Z(2) R) become isomorphic by inverting 2. Then there is an\nisomorphism of triples\ni1 : (L(2) \u2297Z(2) R, \u03c81 , B \u2297Z(2) R)\u2192(L\n \u0303 (2) \u2297Z(2) R, \u03c8, B \u2297Z(2) R).\nc) We assume R is an artinian algebra of perfect residue field. Let I be an ideal of\nR. Then any two representations of B \u2297Z(2) R isomorphic modulo I, are isomorphic.\nd) Referring to c), if \u03c81 is congruent to \u03c8 modulo I, then there is a reductive\nsubgroup of GSp(L(2) \u2297Z(2) R, \u03c81 ) fixing each element of B \u2297Z(2) R and of the same\ndimension as G.\ne) We assume all simple factors of Gad are of some An or Cn Lie type (n \u2208 N). Then\nB is a family of tensors strongly Z(2) -very well positioned w.r.t. \u03c8 for G (in the sense of\n[Va2, 4.3.4]).\nHints and proof of a) in the orthogonal case. For the a) part use the splitness\nproperty in the context of the classification of the possible Cases (A, C or D) of [Ko2,\ntop of p. 375 and p. 395]. The fact that the same classification holds over R, can be\ndeduced from the splitness part by using geometric points of Spec(R[ 21 ]).\nRelated to the orthogonal case, we can assume we are dealing with an involution\nof a matrix algebra End(MR ) of rank 4n2 over R which is defined (in the usual sense;\nsee [KMRT, ch. 1]) by a perfect, symmetric bilinear form (still to be denoted BF ) on\nthe free R-module MR of rank 2n. We can assume R is local and 2-adically complete.\nBF restricted to MR /2MR , being alternating, has the same standard diagonal form: its\nblocks are formed by 2 \u00d7 2 matrices whose entries are 0 on the diagonal and 1 otherwise.\nBut if u, v \u2208 MR /4MR are such that BF (u, v) = 1, BF (u, u) = 2b and B(v, v) = 2a,\nwith a, b \u2208 R/4R, for any x \u2208 R/4R we have BF (u + xv, u + xv) = 2(b + x + x2 a) (here\nwe still denote by BF its reduction mod 4).\nWe get immediately that by passing to an \u00e9tale extension of R which mod 2 is defined\nby at most n equations of the form\nx + cx2 + d = 0,\nwith c, d \u2208 R/2R, and by completing 2-adically, we can assume BF restricted to\nMR /4MR has the standard diagonal form. But, as R is 2-adically complete, by induction we get that we can assume that BF itself has the standard diagonal form. So,\n164\n\n\fas the operation of taking the Zariski closure is well behaved w.r.t. flat extensions, we\ncan assume (by giving up the requirement that R is 2-adically complete) that R is Z(2)\n,\nitself, that MR = Ln and that we are dealing with BF of B2. But QF (v) := BF (v,v)\n2\nv \u2208 Ln , is exactly the quadratic form we considered in B2 and so the first paragraph of\nB2 applies.\nb) follows from a): using an arbitrary maximal split torus of G\u0303R and the description\nof possible Cases in [Ko, p. 395], the situation gets reduced to an abstract one, in a\ncontext where B \u2297Z(2) R is a matrix algebra and we are dealing with a direct sum of at\nmost two copies of its standard representation. c) is trivial. d) follows from a), by using\na natural lifting process. For e), just combine a) with the standard reduction steps of\n[Va2, 4.3.7 5')].\nB4. We start with a morphism y : Spec(F) \u2192 NW (F) . Let\n\u0001\n(A, pA ) := y \u2217 (A, PA )NW (k) .\n\nThe problem we face is: the formal deformation space DS of the triple (A, pA , B) is\nformally smooth over W (F) of relative dimension equal to dimC (X) iff Gad has all its\nsimple factors of some An or Cn Lie type; if Gad has factors of some Dn Lie type (n \u2265\n4), then DSF has a tangent space of dimension greater then dimC (X) (for instance, if\nGad is an absolutely simple Q\u2013group of Dn Lie type then the tangent space of DSF\nhas dimension n + dimC (X); this can be deduced from B2 and from the dimensions of\nhermitian symmetric domains denoted in [He, p. 518] as D III or as C I). To overcome\nthis problem, let (as in [Va2, 5.1.2])\nz : Spec(V ) \u2192 NW (F)\nbe a lift of y, with V a finite, faithfully flat, DVR extension of W (F); it is not a priori a\nclosed embedding. Let\n(AV , pAV ) := z \u2217 ((A, PA )W (F) ),\nand let (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J \u2032 be the family of de Rham components of the family of Hodge cycles with\n1\nwhich AV is (as in 2.3.3) naturally endowed. Let G\u0303V be the subgroup of GL(HdR\n(AV /V ))\n1\n1\nobtained as the Zariski closure of the subgroup of GL(HdR (AV /V )[ 2 ]) fixing t\u03b1 , \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 J \u2032 .\n1\nLet F 1 be the Hodge filtration of HdR\n(AV /V ) defined by AV .\nB5. From Fontaine's comparison theory with Q2 coefficients (used as in 2.3.9 and\nin [Va2, 5.2.17.2]), and the determinant condition of [Ko2, p. 389-90], we deduce that\nthe extra condition of B3 b) (pertaining to making 2 invertible) is satisfied for R = V\nand for the context CON T of the following two triples: (L(2) \u2297Z(2) V, \u03c8, B \u2297Z(2) V ) and\n1\n((HdR\n(AV /V ))\u2217 , pAV , B \u2297Z(2) V ); here we still denote by pAV the perfect alternating form\n1\non (HdR\n(AV /V ))\u2217 defined naturally by pAV (via Fontaine's comparison theory or via de\nRham cohomology). Strictly speaking, in order to appeal to B3, we need to choose an\n1\n\u2217\nisomorphism (L(2) \u2297Z(2) V, B \u2297Z(2) V )\u2192((H\n \u0303\ndR (AV /V )) , B \u2297Z(2) V ); in what follows we\nwill not mention it.\n165\n\n\fHowever, in order to apply B3 b) we need to check that, modulo 2, in the context of\nthe second triple of CONT, involutions of orthogonal first type do not show up.\nB6. Exclusion of involutions of orthogonal first type. We consider a simple\nfactor B2 of B1 \u2297Z(2) Z2 left invariant by \u2217 and such that the resulting involution of B2 [ 12 ]\nis of orthogonal first type. As a Z2 -algebra, it is a matrix algebra M2n (W (F2m )) of a 2n\ndimensional free W (F2m )-module V2n , with m \u2208 N and with n as in B2 (the Brauer group\nof a finite field is trivial). To be consistent with the usual cohomological aspect of this\npaper, it is more convenient to view B and B1 (resp. B2 ) as being semisimple subalgebras\nof End(L\u2217(2) ) (resp. of End(L\u2217(2) \u2297Z(2) Z2 )). Let \u0393 be the Galois group of V [ 12 ] and let\n\u03c1 : \u0393 \u2192 GL2n (W (F2m ))\nbe the Galois representation obtained naturally from the Galois representation on the\ndual of the Tate-module of AV [ 21 ] , by \"concentrating\" only on the part corresponding to\nB2 (viewed in the dual context); the identifications of [Va2, top of p. 473] (performed in\nour present p = 2 context) tell us that this makes sense.\n\u03c1 is a symmetric representation. Moreover, from ALT we get that \u03c1 mod 2 is\nalternating. We consider the 2-divisible group DV of AV . The Zp -algebra M2n (W (F2m ))\nsplits over W (F2m ). So DV [2] \u2297Z2 W (F2m ) gets naturally decomposed (using a W (F2m )endomorphism which is a projector) as a direct sum E1 \u2295 E2 in such a way that E1 [ 21 ] is\nnaturally associated to \u03c1W (F2m ) mod 2. So E1 comes equipped naturally with a bilinear\nprincipal W (F2m )-quasi-polarization. Here \"bilinear principal\" is used as in d) of 2.2.23\nA. Looking at E1 [ 21 ], as \u03c1 mod 2 is alternating, we get that the word \"bilinear\" can be\ndropped. If one wants to avoid using tensor products of the form DV [2] \u2297Z2 W (F2m ),\nthen one needs to restate everything in terms of symmetric quasi-polarizations (bilinear\nforms) on W (F2m )2n viewed as a Z2 -module, which are moreover W (F2m )-bilinear.\nUsing the fact that the Dieudonn\u00e9's functor D on p \u2212 F F (Spec(V /2V )) is faithfully\nflat (cf. the complete intersection situation of [BM, 4.3.2]), all these can be transferred\ninto the crystalline cohomology (and so homology) context (for the convenience of the\nreader, a proof of this \u2013which can be read at any time\u2013 is included in B9 below). In\nparticular, we get that the involution of each simple factor of B2 \u2297F2 V /2V (viewed as a\n1\nfactor of the centralizer of B \u2297Z(2) V /2V in End(HdR\n(AV /V ) \u2297V V /2V ))) is alternating.\nThis ends the argument of the exclusion process.\nB7. So the conditions of B3 a) are satisfied for CON T . We deduce: G\u0303V is a\nreductive group over V ; as V is complete having F as its residue field, it is split and so\nwe (can) identify it with GV . So, (cf. also the p = 2 analogue of 2.3.13.2) to show that\n(f, L(2) , v)) is a SHS, we just have to show that N is formally smooth over O(v) .\nAs in [Va2, 5.3.1] we deduce the existence of a cocharacter \u03bcV : Gm \u2192 GV giving\n1\nbirth to a direct sum decomposition HdR\n(AV /V ) = F 1 \u2295 F 0 , with \u03b2 \u2208 Gm (V ) acting\nthrough \u03bcV on F i as the multiplication with \u03b2 \u2212i , i = 0, 1.\nFor future references, we point out that from B3 b) applied to the two triples of\nCONT we also get:\n166\n\n\ff) They are in fact isomorphic.\nB8. To show that N is formally smooth over O(v) we follow very closely the approach\nof [Va2, 5.2-5]. We recall that some parts of loc. cit. were dealing just with odd primes.\nHowever, as we are dealing essentially just with Hodge cycles which are coming from\nendomorphisms, we can go around the limitations of loc. cit; here the use of \"essentially\"\nhas to do with the fact that the connected component of the origin of the subgroup G1\nof GSp(W, \u03c8) fixing the elements of B, is G. To explain this \"roundaboutness\", we need\nquite a lot of preliminaries.\nLet e(V ) := [V : W (F)]. Let R\u0303e(V ) (resp. Re(V )) be the subring of\nB(F)[[T ]] (with\nP\u221e\nn\nT an independent variable) which is formed by formal power series\nn=0 an T , with\nn\nan \u2208 B(F) such that bn := an [ e(V ) ]! \u2208 W (F), \u2200n \u2208 N \u222a {0} (resp. such that the sequence\n(bn )n\u2208N is formed by elements of W (F) and converges to 0). For q \u2208 N, let I(q) be the\nideal of R\u0303e(V ) formed by formal power series with a0 = a1 = ... = aq\u22121 = 0. Re(V ) and\nR\u0303e(V ) have natural Frobenius lifts \u03a6Re(V ) and respectively \u03a6R\u0303e(V ) : they take T to T 2 .\nWe follow closely [Va2, 5.2.1]. We choose a uniformizer \u03c0V of V . Let fe(V ) \u2208\nW (F)[[T ]] be the Eisenstein polynomial of degree e(V ) having \u03c0V as a root of it. So\nV = W (F)[[T ]]/(fe (V )). Let Se(V ) be the subring of B(F)[[T ]] generated by W (F)[[T ]]\nfn\n\n)\nSe(V ) can be defined also as\nand by e(V\nn! , n \u2208 N. As fe(V ) is an Eisenstein polynomial,\nT en\nthe subring of B(F)[[T ]] generated by W (F)[[T ]] and by n! , n \u2208 N. Its 2-adic completion\nis Re(V ). Warning: we do not have an interpretation for R\u0303e(V ), similar to the one of\nloc. cit. pertaining to odd primes.\n\nBy mapping T to \u03c0V , as V is 2-adically complete, we get a W (F)-epimorphism\nq(\u03c0V ) : Re(V ) \u0589 V.\nWe denote by qn (\u03c0V ) the Wn (F)-epimorphism obtained from q(\u03c0V ) by tensoring with\nWn (F). Ker(qn (\u03c0V )) is an ideal of Re(V )/2n Re(V ) endowed with a natural structure of\ndivided powers (induced from the natural one of Ker(q(\u03c0V ))); unfortunately we do not\nhave nilpotent divided powers. Due to this and the fact that q(\u03c0V ) does not factor through\na W (F)-epimorphism from R\u0303e(V ) to V , [Va2, 5.2-5] needs substantial \"adjustments\". We\nneed the following obvious statement:\nFact. \u2200n \u2208 N, Re/2n Re is the inductive limit of its local artinian Wn (F)-subalgebras\ntaken by \u03a6Re(V ) mod 2n into themselves (and ordered under the relation of inclusion).\nB9. Preliminary assumption. We first assume the triple (AV , pAV , B) lifts to a\n1\n(similar) triple (ARe(V ) , pARe(V ) , B) over Re(V ). Let M := HdR\n(ARe(V ) /Re(V )), let \u03c8M\nbe the perfect form on M defined by pARe(V ) and let \u2207M be the 2-adic completion of the\nGauss\u2013Manin connection on M defined by ARe(V ) . Let \u03a6M be the \u03a6Re(V ) -linear endomorphism of M defined by ARe(V ) . B \u2297Z(2) Re(V ) acts naturally on M . Let F 0 (End(M ))\nbe the maximal direct summand of End(M ) taking the Hodge filtration of M defined by\nARe(V ) into itself.\n167\n\n\fAs Ker(q(\u03c0V )) has a natural divided structure, from the existence of the Dieudonn\u00e9's\nfunctor D as a crystal (see [BM]), we get that the quintuple (M, \u03a6M , \u2207M , \u03c8M , B) is well\ndefined without mentioning (i.e. assuming the existence of) (ARe(V ) , pARe(V ) , B). As the\nelements of B, viewed as endomorphisms of M are fixed by \u03a6M , we get that the involution\nof End(M ) defined by \u03c8M leaves invariant B, producing the same involution of it as \u2217. In\nother words, it is easy to see that two elements of F 0 (End(M )) fixed by \u03a6M and which\ncoincide mod Ker(q(\u03c0V )), are the same; one just needs to use the fact that\nKer(q(\u03c0V )) \u2229 \u2229s\u2208N \u03a6sRe(V ) (Re(V )) = {0}.\nMoreover, the last paragraph of B6 extends automatically to the whole crystalline\nsite CRIS(Spec(V /pn V )/Spec(Z2 )), \u2200n \u2208 N. We get that each simple factor of the\ninvolution of the reduction mod 2 of the centralizer of B in End(M ) induced by \u03c8M is\neither of second type or of alternating first type. We present an argument (in the spirit\nof this paper) for this well known fact (stated first in B6). We can assume we are in the\ncontext of a truncation mod 2 E of a 2-divisible group over V /2V which has a principal\nquasi-polarization pE : E \u2192E\n \u0303 t . We have a natural involution\nIN V : SP \u2192SP\n \u0303\non the space SP of lifts of E to (truncations mod 2 of 2-divisible groups) over some\nfixed artinian W (F)-algebra AL2 lifting AL1 := V /2V in such a way that the kernel\nof the W (F)-epimorphism AL2 \u0589 AL1 is annihilated by the maximal ideal of AL2 : it\ntakes such a lift \u1ebc into the lift \u1ebc t , viewed via pE , as a lift of E. The elements of SP\nfixed by IN V are in one-to-one correspondence to pairs (\u1ebc, p\u1ebc ), with \u1ebc as mentioned\nbefore and with p\u1ebc : \u1ebc \u2192\n \u0303 \u1ebc t an isomorphism lifting pE . But any F-linear automorphism\nof order 2 of a non-trivial F-vector space, has non-zero fixed points. Based on this and\non Grothendieck's deformation theorem of [Il, 4.4 c) and e)] (applied repeatedly to a\nprojective system (ALn )n\u2208N ) we get easily that the pair (E, pE ) lifts to a pair (E1 , pE1 )\nover W (F)[[T ]], with E1 as the truncation mod 2 of a 2-divisible group over W (F)[[T ]]\nand with pE1 an isomorphism E1 \u2192E\n \u0303 1t . So first a) and then b) of 2.2.23 C apply entirely\nto D(E1 ) and to its bilinear principal quasi-polarization defined naturally by pE1 . Using\nthe natural W (k)-monomorphism W (F)[[T ]] \u0592\u2192 Re(V ), we get that the bilinear form on\nthe extension to Re(V ) of the underlying module of D(E1 ) is alternating.\nSo from B3 a) we deduce that we have a natural reductive subgroup of GL(M ); as\nin [Va2, 5.2.2.1 and 5.2.17] we get that it is isomorphic to GRe(V ) .\nFrom the Fact of B8 we get that the level-N symplectic similitude structures of\n(AV , pAV ), with (N, 2) = 1, lift compatibly to level-N symplectic similitude structures of\n(ARe(V ) , pARe(V ) ).\nNext we apply [Va2, 5.3.3]. As in loc. cit., to (ARe(V ) , pARe(V ) ) and its symplectic\nsimilitude structures, it corresponds a morphism\nmRe(V ) : Spec(Re(V )) \u2192 M.\n168\n\n\fThe affine transformation\ng\u03030 : Re(V ) \u2297W (F) V \u2192 Re(V ) \u2297W (F) V\ne(V )\u22121\n\nwhich is V -linear and takes T into \u03c0V\nT + \u03c0V is still well defined. Warning: this is\nnot so if we replace Re(V ) by R\u0303e(V ). We consider an O(v) -monomorphism iV : V \u0592\u2192 C.\nSo, as in [Va2, 5.3.3.1] we construct a W (F)-monomorphism\ng\u0303 : Re(V ) \u0592\u2192 C[[T ]],\nwhich, when composed with the C-epimorphism C[[T ]] \u0589 C defined by T goes to 0,\nbecomes iV \u25e6 q\u03c0V . Warning: the naive way of defining (here or in loc. cit.) g\u0303 directly\nby T goes to T + iV (\u03c0V ) leads into problems of convergence of formal power series with\ncoefficients in C and evaluated at iV (\u03c0V ).\nAs G is the connected component of the origin of G1 and as Re(V ) is an integral ring\nof characteristic 0, \u2207M respects the GRe(V ) -action. We explain what we mean by this.\nThe triple (M, \u03c8M , B) is obtained from a triple (M0 , \u03c80 , B) over W (F) by extensions of\nscalars. This can be proved in many ways: one way relies on the hint for b) of B3; another\nway can be deduced easily from the approach of B10 below. However, here we adopt a\nslightly different approach: denoting by \u2217| the restriction of the involution of End(M ) to\nthe centralizer of B in End(M ), the triple (M, \u2217|, B) is obtained from a (similar) triple\n(M0 , \u2217|, B) over W (F) by extensions of scalars. Argument: the only non-trivial (i.e the D)\ncase is a consequence of the proof of a) of B3 (Re(V ) is strictly henselian and 2-adically\ncomplete, cf. B8). So identifying M = M0 \u2297W (F) Re(V ), (regardless of the fact that we\nuse (M0 , \u03c80 , B) or (M0 , \u2217|, B)) \u2207M is of the form \u03b4 + \u03b2end , with \u03b4 as the connection on\nM annihilating M0 and with (this is what we mean by \u2207M respects the GRe(V ) -action)\n\u03b2end \u2208 Lie(GRe(V ) ) \u2297 dT .\nSo, as in [Va2, 5.3.3.1] we get that mRe(V ) factors through N \u2032 . There is one detail\nwhich needs to be pointed out, as G is not always the subgroup of GSp(W, \u03c8) fixing the\nelements of B; so in order to apply loc. cit. we need to add any one of the following two\nthings:\ni) [Va2, 5.2.2.1 and 5.2.15] make sense for p = 2 as well (being just rational statements) and so we can use all de Rham components of the Hodge cycles with which A is\nnaturally endowed, in order to fully use [Va2, 4.1.5] exactly as mentioned in [Va2, 5.3.3.1];\nii) Lie(G) is the Lie subalgebra of Lie(GSp(W, \u03c8)) annihilating the elements of B\nand so we can still apply [Va2, 4.1.5] without mentioning the extra Hodge cycles of i),\nas loc. cit. relies (as [Fa2, end of rm. iii) after th. 10] does) just on facts involving Lie\nalgebras.\nThe arguments below show that (the p = 2 analogue of) [Va2, 5.3.4] can be skipped.\nLet (A0 , pA0 , B) be the triple we get over W (F) by pulling back (ARe(V ) , pARe(V ) , B)\nvia the W (F)-monomorphism z0 : Spec(W (F)) \u0592\u2192 Spec(Re(V )), defined at the level of\nrings by: T goes to 0.\n169\n\n\fWith its construction we are essentially done, as [Fa2, th. 10 and the remarks after]\ntreat as well the case p = 2. In other words, as in [Va2, 5.4.5] (see also 2.3.11) we construct\na versal deformation (AR , pAR , B) of the triple (A0 , pA0 , B) over R := W (F)[[x1 , ..., xm]],\nwith m := dimC (X). We consider the triple (AR\u0303e(V ) , pAR\u0303e(V ) , B) over R\u0303e(V ) obtained\nfrom the triple (ARe(V ) , pARe(V ) , B) via the W (F)-morphism\nie(V ) : Spec(R\u0303e(V )) \u2192 Spec(Re(V ))\ndefined by the logical W (F)-monomorphism Re(V ) \u0592\u2192 R\u0303e(V ). It is easy to see that it is\nobtained from (AR , pAR , B) by pull back via a W (F)-morphism\nzR\u0303e(V )) : Spec(R\u0303e(V )) \u2192 Spec(R)\nsuch that zR\u0303e(V )) \u25e6 z\u03030 at the level of rings is defined naturally by: xi 's go to 0; here we\ndenote by z\u03030 the natural factorization of z0 through ie(V ) . To see this, we work in the\ncrystalline cohomology context and mimic entirely [Fa2, th. 10 and rm. iii) after it].\nThough R\u0303e(V ) is not isomorphic to W (F)[[T ]], it has all ring properties of W (F)[[T ]]\nneeded in order to be able to mimic loc. cit.:\niii) R\u0303e(V ) is the projective limit of the quotients R\u0303e(V )/I(q) (the transition W (F)epimorphisms being the logical ones);\niv) \u2200q \u2208 N, the quotient I(q)/I(q + 1), as a W (F)-module, is free of rank one;\nv) \u03a6R\u0303e(V ) takes I(q) into I(q + 1), \u2200q \u2208 N.\nIt is the freeness part of iv) which guarantees that we have no obstructions from the\nfact that G1 is not necessarily connected: as Lie(G1 ) = Lie(G), the part of [Fa2, rm. iii)\nafter th. 10] involving strictness for filtrations applies entirely in the same manner.\nTo conclude that NW (F) is formally smooth over W (F) in y, we just have to remark\nthat in the same way we applied [Va2, 4.1.5] in [Va2, 5.4.5], we can apply it in the\npresent situation. In other words, the morphism mR : Spec(R) \u2192 M corresponding\nto (AR , pAR ) and its natural symplectic similitude structures (lifting those of (A0 , pA0 )),\nfactors through NW (F) and (as in [Va2, 5.4.7-8]) the resulting W (F)-morphism is formally\n\u00e9tale. We just need to add: the morphism Spec(W (F)) \u2192 M defined by (A0 , pA0 ) and\nits natural symplectic similitude structures factors through N \u2032 as mRe(V ) does, and so\nmR factors through N \u2032 and so through NW (F) . This proves the Theorem modulo the\nchecking that the preliminary assumption of the beginning of this B9 always holds.\nB10. Argument for the preliminary assumption. It goes in two main steps:\nfirst we work mod 2 and then we use induction modulo (higher) powers of 2.\nThe mod 2 part. First of all we need to show that the triple T RI1 obtained\nfrom (AV , pAV , B) by taken it mod 2, lifts to a triple (ARe(V )/2Re(V ) , pARe(V )/2Re(V ) , B)\nover Re(V )/2Re(V ). V /2V can be identified with F[[T ]]/(T e(V ) ) and so q1 (\u03c0V ) factors\nthrough R\u0303e(V )/2R\u0303e(V ); we denote by\nzV /2V : Spec(V /2V ) \u2192 Spec(R\u0303e(V )/2R\u0303e(V ))\n170\n\n\fthis factorization, viewed at the level of schemes. We recall from B9, that the quintuple\n(M, \u03a6M , \u2207M , \u03c8M , B) is well defined (without any assumption) and that we have naturally\na reductive subgroup GRe(V ) of GL(M ). We have:\nLemma. The cocharacter \u03bcV lifts to a cocharacter \u03bcRe(V ) of GRe(V ) .\nThe proof of this is very much the same as of [Va2, 5.3.2]. The only difference: we\ncan not be so explicit in writing done some ideals and in fact we have to deal as well with\nW (F)-monomorphisms (between W (F)-algebras) and not just with W (F)-epimorphisms.\nSo, based on the Fact of B8, we consider a sequence\n(An )n\u2208N ,\nwith An a Wn (F)-subalgebra of Re(V )/2n Re(V ), such that \u2200n \u2208 N we have:\nP1 An is included in An+1 mod 2n ;\nP2 under qn (\u03c0V ), An is mapped surjectively onto V /2n V ;\nP3 GRe(V )/2n Re(V ) is obtained from a reductive group GAn over An by extension of\nscalars and the reduction of GAn+1 mod 2n is naturally identified with the logical\npull back (see P1) of GAn .\nBy induction on n \u2208 N we get (as in loc. cit.) a cocharacter \u03bcn of GAn lifting (see\nP2) the reduction of \u03bcV mod 2n and such that \u03bcn+1 mod 2n is obtained by natural pull\nback (see P3) from \u03bcn . So to get the Lemma we just need to take \u03bcRe(V ) such that its\nreduction mod 2n is obtained from \u03bcn by natural pull back (see P3), \u2200n \u2208 N.\n0\n1\nproduced by \u03bcRe(V ) (so\n\u2295 FM\nWe consider the direct sum decomposition M = FM\ni\n1\n\u03b2 \u2208 Gm (Re(V )) acts through \u03bcRe(V ) on F (M ) by multiplication with \u03b2 \u2212i ). FM\nlifts the\n1\n1\ndirect summand F of HdR (AV /V ) = M/Ker(q(\u03c0V )).\n\nSo, without having (A0 , pA0 , B) we can construct its filtered \u03c3-crystal endowed with a\n1\n, \u03a6M , B) via z0 . So, as in [Va2, 5.4.5]\nfamily of endomorphisms by just pulling back (M, FM\n(see also 2.2.21 UP) we can construct (without having (AR , pAR , B)) a versal, principally\nquasi-polarized filtered F -crystal CR over R/2R endowed with a family B of endomorphisms; here R is as in B9. From [dJ1, th. of intro.] (the form of it we need is reproved\nin 3.14 B6 below) and from Serre\u2013Tate's deformation theory we deduce the existence of\na unique triple (AR/2R , pAR/2R , B) lifting the special fibre (AV , pAV , B)F of (AV , pAV , B)\nand whose F -crystal over R is obtained from CR and its family of endomorphisms by\nforgetting the filtration of the underlying R-module of CR .\nThe extension of (M, F 1 , \u03a6M , \u2207M , B) to R\u0303e(V ) is obtained from (CR , B) by pull\nback via a W (F)-morphism zR\u0303e(V ) : Spec(R\u0303e(V )) \u2192 Spec(R): this is nothing else but the\ncorresponding part of B9, performed just in terms of principally quasi-polarized filtered\nF -crystals endowed with endomorphisms and not in terms of principally polarized abelian\nschemes with endomorphisms.\nAs V /2V is a complete intersection, again based on [BM, 4.3.2], we get that the pull\nback of (AR/2R , pAR/2R , B) via the composite of zV /2V with zR\u0303e(V ) mod 2, is nothing else\n171\n\n\fbut T RI1 . But from the Fact of B8, we get that the resulting F-morphism R/2R \u2192 V /2V\nlifts to an F-morphism R/2R \u2192 Re(V )/2Re(V ). This ends the mod 2 part.\nThe inductive part. The second step is to lift, by induction on n \u2208 N, the triple\nT RI(1) over Re(V )/2Re(V ) lifting T RI1 to a triple T RI(n+1) over Re(V )/2n+1 Re(V )\nlifting naturally (i.e. in a compatible way) the reduction T RIn+1 mod 2n+1 of the triple\n1\n(AV , pAV , B). We can assume FM\nmod 2 is the filtration of M/2M defined by the\nlift of AV /2V to Re(V )/2Re(V ) we got (we just have to redo the Lemma once more).\nAccordingly, we want T RI(n + 1) in such a way that the filtration of M/2n+1 M it\n1\ndefines is nothing else but FM\nmod 2n+1 .\nAs the ideal 4Re(V ) of Re(V ) has a natural divided power structure, nilpotent\nmodulo any ideal 2m Re(V ) with m \u2208 N, m \u2265 3, we get that we can assume n = 1.\nWe consider two ideals of Re(V )/4Re(V ): I1 is the ideal generated by 2, while I2 is\nKer(q2 (\u03c0V )). Their intersection is nothing else but 2I2 and so its induced divided power\nstructure is nilpotent. There is a unique triple\n(A(Re(V )/4Re(V ))/2I2 , pA(Re(V )/4Re(V ))/2I2 , B)\nlifting T RI(1) and T RI2 at the same time. So, due to the just mentioned nilpotent part, there is a unique way of lifting (A(Re(V )/4Re(V ))/2I2 , pA(Re(V )/4Re(V ))/2I2 , B) to\nRe(V )/4Re(V ) in the way prescribed by F 1 mod 4. This takes care of n = 1 and so ends\nthe inductive part.\nConclusion. Due to the mentioned compatibility the triple (AV , pAV , B) lifts to\na triple over Spf(Re(V )); as we are in a principally polarized context, we can replace\n(cf. Grothendieck's algebraization theorem) \"Spf\" by \"Spec\". So indeed the triple\n(AV , pAV , B) lifts to a triple (ARe(V ) , pARe(V ) , B) over Spec(Re(V )). This ends the argument for the preliminary assumption and so the proof of the Theorem.\nB11. Remarks. 1) It is worth pointing out that the above proof does not use\nFontaine's comparison theory (if in B9 we go ahead with ii) and not with i) and if we\nare not bothered to get f) of B7; warning: B5 can be worked out as well in the de Rham\ncontext). To be compared with the proof of [Va2, 5.1] which relies on such a theory.\n2) B3 a) points out that the theory of [Va2, 4.3] of O-well positioned families of\ntensors (with O a DVR) can be \"extended\":\na) we use tensors which are not necessarily linear (like the function QF (v) of the\nproof of it: we have QF (\u03b1v) = \u03b12 v, \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 MR );\nb) we impose restrictions on tensors modulo the maximal ideal of O.\nHowever, such theories are not easily adaptable to (i.e. usable in) the crystalline\ncontext of [Fa2, \u00a74].\n3) We refer to [Va2, 4.1] for notations. B9 ii) points out that [Va2, 4.1.3-5] have\nversions, where we replace the set J of loc. cit., with a subset J0 of it such that the\nsubgroup of GSp(W, \u03c8) fixing s\u03b1 , \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 J0 , has G as its connected component of the\n172\n\n\forigin. For these versions, we just need to replace in [Va2, 4.1.3] \"becomes a quadruple of\nA(G, X, W, \u03c8)\" by \"can be extended (by adding tensors indexed by J \\J0 ) to a quadruple\nof A(G, X, W, \u03c8)\".\n4) R\u0303e(V ) is the simplest example of the class of GD-rings (here GD stands for good\ndeformation) to be axiomatized in \u00a76 (starting from iii) to v) of B9).\n5) Using [Va2, 5.6.4] we get immediately (cf. also B4) that N = N \u2032 , provided Gad\ndoes not have factors of some Dn Lie type (n \u2265 4). However, loc. cit. does not apply to\nthe case of such factors.\nC. 2.3.8 3) and conventions 2.3.7 and 2.3.9.2 apply but not 2.3.8 1). However, if we\nreplace 2(p \u2212 2) by max{2, 2(p \u2212 2)} in 2.3.8 1) (in order to accommodate the case p = 2),\nthen the p = 2 analogue of (the modified) 2.3.8 1) is the Theorem of B. 2.3.6 makes no\nsense for p = 2. It is premature to state a morally supportive variant of 2.3.8.1; however,\nthe proof of [Va2, 6.7.2] can be used with the same purpose for p = 2 as well. Similarly,\nit is premature to deal with the p = 2 analogue of 2.3.8 2).\nD. The parts a) and c) of 2.3.9 remain valid without any modification as (cf. A)\n2.3.5.1 holds for p = 2. Moreover, 2.3.9 d) applies as well provided (*) of 2.3.9 D holds:\nthe part of the proof of 2.3.9 referring to [Ja, 10.4 of Part I] applies as well. Briefly, this\ngoes as follows. The difference is that, with the notations of the proof of 2.3.9, G\u03030k is\nthe subgroup of GL(L0 /pL0 ) fixing a non-degenerate quadratic form Q\u03030 in m variables\n(argument: this is so over k\u0304, cf. [Bo2, 23.6] and its lift version to W (k\u0304); but such a\nquadratic form is unique modulo an invertible element and so, using Hilbert's Theorem\n90, we can assume it is defined over k). Now after a finite (computable) number n(m) of\nGalois extensions (the first one of k) of degree 2 we can bring Q\u03030 in the standard form\nx10 + x1 x2 + ... + x2n\u22121 x2n (resp. x1 x2 + ... + x2n\u22121 x2n ) if m = 2n + 1 is odd (resp. if\nm = 2n is even). We postpone to refer to any p = 2 equivalent of 2.3.9 b).\nE. 2.3.10-16 remain valid: this is so due to the fact that [Fa2, th. 10] and the remarks\nfollowing it are still true for p = 2; so [Va2, 5.4] and its variants (see 2.3.11) remain true\nfor p = 2. But in connection to 2.3.17 we have to be more careful: for p = 2 the second\nparagraph of the proof of 2.3.17 has to be modified slightly, as a 2-divisible group over\nW (k) is not determined by its associated filtered \u03c3-crystal; however it applies to 2.3.17\nin the same way (see 2.3.18.1 B and C and 2.4.1 below), provided:\n\u2013 for the uniqueness part of 2.3.17 we restrict to the case when (M, \u03c6) does not have\nslope 0;\n\u2013 for the existence part of the whole of 2.3.17 (inclusive 2.3.17.2) we restrict to the\ncase when k has no abelian extensions of degree 2 or to the case when (M, \u03c6) does not\nhave slope 0 or does not have slope 1.\n2.3.18.1. A review. Here we recall some known facts on 2-divisible groups D over\na perfect field k of characteristic 2, for which we could not find a good reference.\nA. We write D as a product\nD = D1 \u00d7 D2\n173\n\n\fsuch that D1 is ordinary, while D2 has all its slopes in the interval (0, 1). Let (M, \u03c6)\nbe its \u03c3-crystal and let M = M1 \u2295 M2 be the corresponding direct sum decomposition.\nFor simplifying the presentation, we choose a lift of D to a 2-divisible group D(2) over\nW2 (k). Let n \u2208 N \u222a {0} be such that k n is the k-linear space parameterizing lifts of D\nto W2 (k), with D(2) corresponding to the origin. Let Tdef be the vector group scheme\nit defines naturally. Let k n be the k-linear space which parameterizes lifts of the F 1 filtration of M/2M (defined as the kernel of \u03c6 mod 2) to F 1 -filtrations of M/4M , with\nthe F 1 -filtration of M/4M defined by D(2) as the origin; let Tfil be the vector group\nscheme it defines naturally.\nIn what follows we assume n > 0: if n = 0 all results below are trivial. There is a\nnatural morphism (of schemes):\nmD : Tdef \u2192 Tfil .\nIts existence can be seen easily using crystalline cohomology theory (i.e. using the D\nfunctor in the context of the universal deformation space of D over W (k)[[x1 , ..., xn]]; see\n2.2.1.0 and [Il, 4.8]); see also 2.4 below for a second approach via PD-hulls and crystals.\nWe would like to point out that the role of D(2) is irrelevant here: above, instead of\nk-vector spaces, we can consider as well affine spaces (in the classical sense of Euclidean\nGeometry); a change of D(2) corresponds to a change of the origins of Tdef and of Tfil .\nWe have:\nB. Fact. mD is a dominant, finite morphism. Generically, the field extension of\nthe field of fractions F F of Tfil we get, is the composite of at most n extensions of degree\n2 of F F .\nProof: We first mention the case when D is an ordinary 2-divisible group over k\nand its lift D(2) to W2 (k) is modeled on (i.e. lifts to) its canonical lift. But in such a\ncase this Fact can be checked without difficulty, starting from the theory of canonical\ncrystalline coordinates. In other words, [Ka3, 4.3.1] and the standard formulas of pulling\nback F -crystals (see [De3, 1.1]; for mod 4 versions of loc. cit. see also [Fa1, p. 36-37] and\nthe reference to it in 2.2.1 c)) reduces the situation to the case when D is the 2-divisible\ngroup of an ordinary elliptic curve. For this last case we refer to [Og, 3.14] (from loc. cit.\nwe get: mD can be identified with a morphism Spec(k[t]) \u2192 Spec(k[t]) which at the level\nof rings takes t into t2 \u2212 t). We conclude: mD is a Galois cover of whose Galois group is\n(Z/2Z)n .\nTo treat the general case without appealing to heavy computations, we use a specialization argument. So let V (k) be the normalization of k[[x]] in the algebraic closure of\nk((x)). Let DV (k) be a 2-divisible group over V (k) lifting D and whose generic fibre is ordinary (for instance, cf. 3.1.8.1 below; it can be read at any time). Let DV (k) (2) be a lift of\n1\nit to W2 (V (k)) which also lifts D(2) (cf. [Il, 4.4]). Let MV (k) := Hcrys\n(DV (k) /W (V (k))).\nV (k)\n\nV (k)\n\nAs in A, we denote by Tdef (resp. by Tfil ) the n dimensional affine V (k)-scheme\nwhose V (k)-valued points parameterize lifts of DV (k) to W2 (V (k)) (resp. lifts. of\nthe F 1 -filtration of MV (k) /2MV (k) defined naturally by DV (k) to an F 1 -filtration of\n174\n\n\fMV (k) /4MV (k) ), with DV (k) (2) (resp. with the F 1 -filtration of MV (k) /4MV (k) defined by\nDV (k) (2)) corresponding to its origin. We get (easy argument at the level of V (k)-valued\npoints): mD is the special fibre of a natural morphism\nV (k)\n\nmDV (k) : Tdef\n\nV (k)\n\n\u2192 Tfil\n\n(whose generic fibre is constructed as mD is).\nIt is easy to see that mD has finite fibres (see also E below). So mD is a dominant\nmorphism. From Zariski's Main Theorem, we get that Tdef is an open subscheme of\nthe normalization of Tfil in the field of fractions of Tdef . But Ank can not be an open\nsubscheme of an integral, affine k-scheme S such that S \\ Ank is non-empty: otherwise\nwe would get that the polynomial ring k[x1 , ..., xn] has invertible elements which do not\nbelong to k. So mD is also a finite morphism. As the generic fibre of mDV (k) is a Galois\ncover of whose Galois group is (Z/2Z)n , the Fact follows.\nC. From B we get that the natural map\nmD (k\u0304) : Tdef (k\u0304) \u2192 Tfil (k\u0304)\ndefined by mD is surjective.\nIn general, the fibres of mD (k\u0304) are related to the passage to some particular isogenies\n(involving the 2-torsion). So using (see E below) Fontaine's comparison theory with integral coefficients in the context of 2-divisible groups over W (k), such a fibre mD (k\u0304)\u22121 (\u03b1)\ncan have more than 1 element precisely in the case when M1 has both slopes 0 and 1\nwith positive multiplicity. So, if (M1 , \u03c6) has only the slope 0 or only the slope 1 or if\nM1 = {0}, then mD (k\u0304) is a bijection.\nD. On the other hand, to lift a 2-divisible group D(m) over Wm (k) lifting D, with\nm \u2208 N, m \u2265 2, to a 2-divisible group over Wm+q (k), with q \u2208 N, we just have to lift the\nF 1 -filtration of M/2m M defined by D(m) to an F 1 -filtration of M/2n+m M . This is a\nconsequence of [Me, ch. 4-5], as the ideal 2m Wm+q (k) of Wm+q (k) is equipped naturally\nwith a nilpotent divided power structure (which is not the case for the ideal 2Wm+q (k)\nof Wm+q (k)). Combining this with the Fact of B, we get:\nCorollary. For any direct summand F 1 of M such that the triple C := (M, F 1 , \u03c6)\nis a filtered \u03c3-crystal, there is an abelian extension k1 of k of Galois group a subgroup of\nZ/2Zn , such that the extension of C to k1 is associated to a 2-divisible group over k1 .\nE. We now recall how Fontaine's comparison theory with integral coefficients in\nthe context of 2-divisible groups over W (k) applies in C. We follow [Fa2, ch. 4 and\nch. 6]. Warning: in [Fa2, ch. 1] it is stated that in [Fa2, ch. 2-6] an odd prime is\nused. However, in [Fa2, ch. 8] (especially see the ending paragraph of loc. cit.) it is\nexplained why the things are fine for p = 2 as well; so below we do refer to [Fa2, ch.\n4 and ch. 6] even for p = 2. Let B + (W (k)) be the Fontaine's ring constructed as in\n[Fa2, ch. 4 and ch. 8], using the 2-adic topology (for completing); the reason we do\n175\n\n\fnot use the PD topology (for completing) is that we could not convince ourselves that\nwe still get a natural Frobenius lift (see also [Fa2, p. 125] where the arguments refer\nonly to odd primes). We recall: B + (W (k)) is an integral,\nlocal W (k)-algebra, endowed\n\u0001\ni\n+\nwith a separated, decreasing filtration F (B (W (k)) i\u2208N\u222a{0} , with a Frobenius lift F R,\nand with a natural Galois action by \u0393k (cf. also [FI, 1.3]). Moreover we have a natural\nW (k)-epimorphism compatible with the natural Galois actions by \u0393k\n\u2227\n\nsW (k) : B + (W (k)) \u0589 W (k) ,\n\u2227\n\nwhere W (k) is the 2-adic completion of the normalization of W (k) in B(k). Its kernel\nis F 1 (B + (W (k))) and so we can identify\ngr 0 := F 0 (B + (W (k)))/F 1 (B + (W (k)) = B + (W (k))/F 1 (B + (W (k))\n\u2227\n\nwith W (k) . So\ngr 1 := F 1 (B + (W (k))/F 2 (B + (W (k))\n\u2227\n\nis naturally a W (k) -module: it is free of rank one; let u be a generator of it. Let\n\u03b20 \u2208 F 1 (B + (W (k))) be defined as in [Fa2, p. 125] (in [FI, 1.2.3 and 1.3.3] it is denoted\n\u2227\nby t); its image in gr 1 is 2u times an invertible element i\u03b20 of W (k) and, even more,\n\u03b20\n\u2208 F 1 (B + (W (k)))\n2\nand\nF R(\u03b20 ) = 2\u03b20\n(cf. any one of the last two loc. cit.).\n1\n(D0 ) be the dual of its\nLet D0 be a 2-divisible group over W (k) lifting D. Let H\u00e9t\n1\n1\nTate-module. Let F be the F -filtration of M it defines naturally. Let F 0 be a direct\nsupplement of F 1 in M . We have a B + (W (k))-monomorphism\n1\niM (D0 ) : M \u2297W (k) B + (W (k)) \u0592\u2192 H\u00e9t\n(D0 ) \u2297Z2 B + (W (k))\n1\nrespecting the tensor product filtrations (the filtration of H\u00e9t\n(D0 ) is defined logically by:\n1\n1\n0\n1\n1\nF (H\u00e9t (D0 )) = {0} and F (H\u00e9t (D0 )) = H\u00e9t (D0 )), the Galois actions, and the Frobenius;\nall these Frobenius endomorphisms of modules are still denoted by F R.\nIts existence is just a particular case of [Fa2, th. 7] (cf. end of [Fa2, ch. 8]). From\nthe way loc. cit is stated, clearly the prime 2 is also treated. However, we need to point\nout that the ring RV used in loc. cit., as p = 2, is not definable as in [Fa2, ch. 2] (for\ninstance, if k = F, then the ring RV of loc. cit. is not the ring R\u0303e(V ) used in 2.3.18 B8\nbut the ring Re(V ) of the mentioned place). Moreover, our case is very simple: W (k)\nhas no ramification and so, as B + (W (k)) is a W (k)-algebra, we can trivially define the\ncrystalline cohomology group of D0 relative to B + (W (k)), using (cf. end of [Fa2, ch. 8])\n\n176\n\n\fCRIS(Spec(k)/Spec(W (k))). It can be checked that, working with the mentioned site,\nthe homology and the cohomology of Q2 /Z2 can still be computed similarly to [Fa2, p.\n132-3] (see [BM, ch. 2]).\nThe part of [Fa2, th. 7] expressing the fact that the cokernel of iM (D0 ) is annihilated\nby the element \u03b20 , in its simpler form, can be restated as (cf. also the strictness part of\n[Fa2, th. 5] and the above part pertaining to i\u03b20 ):\n\u2227\n\nKey Property. The W (k) -linear map\n1\njM (D0 ) : F 0 \u2297W (k) gr 1 \u2295 F 1 \u2297W (k) gr 0 \u2192 H\u00e9t\n(D0 ) \u2297Z2 gr 1 ,\n\ninduced naturally from iM (D0 ) at the level of one gradings, is injective and its cokernel\nis annihilated by 2.\nIf now D01 is another 2-divisible group over W (k) lifting D, producing the same F 1 filtration F 1 of M , then via the similarly constructed B + (W (k))-monomorphism iM (D01 ),\n1\n1\n1\nH\u00e9t\n(D10 ) is (cf. the Key Property) a Z2 -lattice of H\u00e9t\n(D0 )[ 21 ] containing 2H\u00e9t\n(D0 ) and\n1 1\n1\ncontained in 2 H\u00e9t (D0 ). Using a well known theorem of Tate, we get that D0 is determined\nby such a Z2 -lattice, and this takes care (cf. also paragraph D) of the finiteness part of\n1\n1\nthe fibres of mD . If H\u00e9t\n(D0 ) 6= H\u00e9t\n(D01 ), i.e. if D0 6= D01 as lifts of D, let\n1\n1\nH 1 := H\u00e9t\n(D0 ) \u2229 H\u00e9t\n(D01 ).\n1\nLet H01 be a direct summand of H 1 contained in 2H\u00e9t\n(E), with E \u2208 {D0 , D01 }: we do\nhave non-zero such summands; warning: we do not require H01 to be \u0393k -invariant. So,\nvia jM (E), H01 \u2297Zp gr 1 is a direct summand of F 0 \u2297W (k) gr 1 \u2295 F 1 \u2297W (k) gr 0 . We deduce\nthe existence of an element\n\na \u2208 F F 1 := F 0 \u2297W (k) F 1 (B + (W (k)) \u2295 F 1 \u2297W (k) B + (W (k))\nsuch that the following three things hold:\na) F R(a) = 2a;\nb) its image in F 0 \u2297W (k) gr 1 \u2295 F 1 \u2297W (k) gr 0 is non-zero modulo the maximal ideal\n\u2227\n\nmbig of W (k) ;\nc) its image in H 1 \u2297Zp gr 1 belongs to H01 \u2297Zp gr 1 and moreover its image in H01 \u2297Zp\ngr 1 /mbig gr 1 is non-zero.\nFor instance, we can take a := iM (E)( 2b \u03b20 ), where b \u2208 H01 generates a direct sum1\nmand of it and moreover 2b \u2208 H\u00e9t\n(E); as 2b \u03b20 = b \u03b220 , we get that a) to c) hold.\nWe assume now that (M, \u03c6) does not have integral slopes, i.e. we assume M1 = {0}.\nWe want to reach a contradiction. We can assume k = k\u0304. We choose a W (k)-basis B1 =\n{e1 , ..., edimW (k) (M ) } (resp. B2 = {f1 , ..., fdimW (k) (M ) }) of an arbitrary W (k)-submodule\nN of M (resp. of M ) such that \u03c6l (ei ) = 2ni ei , \u2200i \u2208 S(1, dimW (k) (M )), with l \u2208 N and\n177\n\n\fwith all ni 's belonging to the set S(1, l \u2212 1) (resp. such that it is formed by elements of\nF 0 and of F 1 ). Let q \u2208 N be such that pq M \u2282 N . We write\ndimW (k) (M )\n\na=\n\nX\n\n\u03b1i fi ,\n\ni=1\n\nwith \u03b1i belonging to F 1 (B + (W (k)) if fi \u2208 F 0 and to B + (W (k)) if fi \u2208 F 1 . Let m :=\nl(q + 1). We have (l \u2212 1)(q + 1) + q < m. As {\u03c6m (fi )|i \u2208 S(1, dimW (k) (M ))} is a\nB(k)-basis of M [ p1 ] formed by elements of N \\ p(q+1)(l\u22121)+q M , and as F Rm (a) = 2m a \u2208\n2m M \u2297W (k) B + (W (k)), we get that \u2200i \u2208 S(1, dimW (k) (M )) such that fi \u2208 F 1 , \u03b1i is\nnot an invertible element. So the image of a in F F 1 /mbig F F 1 belongs to the image of\n\u2227\nF 0 \u2297Zp gr 1 into this last W (k) /mbig -module (i.e. k-vector space).\nFrom this, c) and the structure of B + (W (k))/F 2 (B + (W (k)) (as an extension of\ngr by gr 1 ), we deduce the existence of an element b0 \u2208 F 0 such that iM (E)(b0 ) \u2208\nH 1 \u2297Zp B + (W (k)) is non-zero modulo the maximal ideal of B + (W (k)). This implies\n(M, \u03c6) has slopes 0. Contradiction. So M1 is non-zero.\n0\n\nWe assume now that (M, \u03c6) does not have slope 1. So (M1 , \u03c6) has pure slope 0. Let\n1\n1\nH0 be the direct summand of H\u00e9t\n(D0 ) and of H\u00e9t\n(D01 ) such that H0 [ 21 ] corresponds (via\nFontaine's comparison theory) to the filtered isocrystal (M1 [ 21 ], 0, \u03c61 ). It is also a direct\nsummand of H 1 . So we can choose H01 such that H01 \u2295 H0 is still a direct summand of\nH 1 . Based on the same arguments as above, we can assume b0 \u2208 M2 . So (M, \u03c6) has the\nslope 0 with multiplicity greater than the rank of M1 . Contradiction. So (M, \u03c6) has the\nslope 1 with positive multiplicity. Using the standard Cartier duality, we get that (M, \u03c6)\nhas as well the slope 0 with positive multiplicity. This takes care of the bijectiveness part\nof C.\n2.3.18.1.1. The fibres of mD . We assume now that D0 is the product of the\ncanonical lift of D1 with an arbitrary lift D2 of D2 . The same arguments of 2.3.18.1 E\ncan be used to give that any lift D10 of D as in the mentioned place is a product of a lift of\nD1 with D2 (we can also use the fact that the Galois representation associated to D2 [2]\ndoes not fix any non-zero element and that D01 is the extension of a 2-divisible group by\nD2 ). In general we have:\nFact. All fibres of mD (k\u0304) (of 2.3.18.1 B) have exactly 2s(\u22121) points, where s(\u22121) is\nthe multiplicity of the slope \u22121 for (End(M ), \u03c6).\nProof: Let D0 and F 1 be as in 2.3.18.1 E. D0 is the extension of an \u00e9tale 2-divisible\ngroup D01 by another 2-divisible group D02 over W (k) whose special fibre does not have\nslope 0. D02 is uniquely determined by F 1 , cf. 2.3.18.1 C. D02 itself is the extension of\na 2-divisible group D03 which does not have integral slopes by a 2-divisible group D04 of\nmultiplicative type. We have a short exact sequence of k-vector spaces\n(EXT )\n0 \u2192 Ext1 (D01 W2 (k) , D04 W2 (k) ) \u0592\u2192 Ext1 (D01 W2 (k) , D02 W2 (k) ) \u0589 Ext1 (D01 W2 (k) , D03 W2 (k) ) \u2192 0\n178\n\n\f(the surjectivity part is checked by reasons of dimension). D0 W2 (k) is given by an\nelement \u03b3 \u2208 Ext1 (D01 W2 (k) , D02 W2 (k) ); its image in Ext1 (D01 W2 (k) , D02 W2 (k) ) is determined by F 1 /4F 1 (again cf. 2.3.18.1 C). So (cf. also 2.3.18.1 D) the number\nof lifts D0 of D giving birth to F 1 are in one-to-one correspondence to the number of elements in Ext1 (D01 W2 (k) , D04 W2 (k) ) giving birth to the same F 1 -filtration of\n1\nHcrys\n(D04k \u00d7 D01k /W2 (k)). So, as s(\u22121) is the product of the ranks of D01 and D04 , the\nFact follows from the first paragraph of the proof of 2.3.18.1 B.\n2.3.18.1.2. Exercise. Using 2.3.18.1.1 show that the morphism mD of 2.3.18.1 B\nis a Galois cover. Hint: the situation gets reduced to the ordinary case.\n2.3.18.2. The case p = 2 for some parts of 2.2. We assume k is an algebraically\nclosed field of characteristic 2. First we refer to 2.2.16.2. Any cyclic diagonalizable filtered\n\u03c3-crystal (M, F 1 , \u03c6) is a direct sum of circular diagonalizable filtered \u03c3-crystals. From\n2.3.18.1 C and E we deduce that if the Newton polygon of (M, \u03c6) does not have slope\n0 or 1, then we have attached to it a uniquely determined Galois representation with\ncoefficients in Z2 ; so in such a context the Corollary of 2.2.16.2 still holds, as the part of\nits proof involving endomorphisms still holds.\nAccordingly, as we can always isolate aside the slopes 0 and 1 (as in 2.3.18.1 A),\n2.2.16.3 remains true for p = 2 as well. Similarly, we get that the Proposition of D of\n2.2.22 3) remains true for p = 2. This implies that the whole of D, F, G, H, I, K and M\nof 2.2.22 3) remains true for p = 2.\n2.3.18.3. Remark. Let now p be an arbitrary prime. 2.3.18.1 E can be adapted\nto p-divisible objects of MF[a,p\u22121+a] (W (k)) as follows. Performing a Tate twist we\ncan assume a = 0. [Fa1, p. 35-36] explains how to associate Galois representations to\ntruncations of such p-divisible objects; using projective limits we can associate a Galois\nrepresentation \u03c1 to a p-divisible object C of MF[0,p\u22121] (W (k)). Of course, one needs to see\nwhen it involves a free Zp -module N of the same rank as the underlying module of C. We\nwill not stop to argue this (it is a consequence of [CF]); we will just mention that in the\ncase C is cyclic diagonalizable, it is easy to see based on loc. cit. that indeed N is free and\nhas the right rank. Moreover, following the pattern of 2.3.18.1 E it can be checked that,\nif C either does not have direct summands which are p-divisible objects of MF[0,0](W (k))\nor does not have direct summands which are p-divisible objects of MF[p\u22121,p\u22121] (W (k)),\nthen C is uniquely determined by its associated Galois representation. So referring to iv)\nof L of 2.2.22 3), we can replace p \u2265 m + 2 by p \u2265 m + 1.\n2.4. Some identifications. What follows is thought as an appendix of \u00a72: we\ndetail [Va2, 5.5.1] (slightly reformulated) in the abstract context of Shimura \u03c3-crystals;\nmoreover the case p = 2 is included as well. Based on the end of 2.2.10 and of 2.2.21,\nthere is no need to restate all things below in a principally quasi-polarized context. So,\nbased on Fact 4 of 2.3.11 (and its p = 2 version), everything below applies to the context\nof a (p = 2) SHS.\nWe start with a Shimura p-divisible group (D, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ) over W (k), with k an arbitrary perfect field. Let (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ) be its attached non-necessarily quasi-split\n179\n\n\fShimura filtered \u03c3-crystal. Let R := W (k)[[x1 , ..., xm]], with m := dd((M, \u03c6, G)). Let\nDR := (DR , (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ) be a universal Shimura p-divisible group over Spec(R) which in the\nW (k)-valued point of Spec(R) defined by making all xi 's to be 0, is (D, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ). Let\nP (resp. PM ) be the parabolic subgroup of G (resp. of GL(M )) normalizing F 1 . Let\nSpec(R1 ) be the completion of G/P in its W (k)-valued point defined by the origin of G.\nAs a W (k)-algebra, R1 is isomorphic to R (cf. 2.2.22 4)).\nLet RP D (resp. R1P D ) be the p-adic completion of the PD-hull of the maximal ideal\nof R (resp. of R1 ). The pull back to Spec(RP D /pRP D ) of the F -crystal with tensors over\nR/pR defined by DR is trivial, i.e. it can be identified with (M \u2297W (k) RP D , \u03c6\u22971, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J )\n(see [BM]). So, corresponding to the F 1 -filtration of M \u2297W (k) RP D defined by the pull\nback of DR to Spec(RP D ), we get naturally a W (k)-morphism\nF IL : Spec(RP D ) \u2192 GL(M )/PM .\nIt factors through G/P as it can be checked using W (k)-valued points of Spec(RP D ) (see\nFact 2 of 2.2.9 3)). As RP D /pn RP D is an inductive limit of its artinian local Wn (k)subalgebras (this is the same as the Fact of 2.3.18 B), \u2200n \u2208 N, we get that F IL factors\nthrough Spec(R1 ) and so through R1P D . The resulting W (k)-morphism\nF IL0 : Spec(RP D ) \u2192 Spec(R1P D ),\nis an isomorphism if p \u2265 3 or if p = 2 and each W (k)-valued point of Spec(R1P D ) lifts\nuniquely to a W (k)-valued point of Spec(RP D ), as it can be checked immediately at the\nlevel of tangent spaces, starting from the fact that DR is universal. By the identification\nof [Va2, 5.5.1] we meant such W (k)-isomorphisms as F IL0 (with p \u2265 3).\nAny W (k)-automorphism gR : Spec(R)\u2192Spec(R)\n \u0303\nextends to a W (k)-automorphism\nPD\ngR\nof Spec(RP D ). We assume now that there is g \u2208 Gad which mod p normalizes\nF 0 (Lie(Gad ))/pF 0 (Lie(Gad )) and such that:\n\u2013 the F 0 -filtration Fg0\u2217 (z) of Lie(Gad ) defined by the pull back through gR of any\nR\nSpec(W (k))-section z of Spec(R) whose attached Shimura adjoint filtered Lie \u03c3-crystal\nis defined by an F 0 -filtration Fz0 of Lie(Gad ), is nothing else but g \u22121 (Fz0 ).\nDenoting still by g, the W (k)-automorphism of Spec(R1 ) (resp. of Spec(R1P D ))\ndefined by inner conjugation by g (resp. defined by inner conjugation by g and passage\nto the p-adic completion of P D-hulls), we get:\nPD\nFact. g \u25e6 F IL0 = F IL0 \u25e6 gR\n.\n\nProof: It is enough to check this equality at the level of W (k)-valued points of\nSpec(RP D ); but for such points, the equality holds, cf. the assumption.\nCorollary. We assume that either p \u2265 3 or p = 2 and each W (k)-valued point of\nSpec(R1P D ) lifts uniquely to a W (k)-valued point of Spec(RP D ). Let V be a faithfully flat\nW (k)-algebra which is a complete DVR of index of ramification at most p \u2212 1. If gR acts\nfreely on Spec(R[ p1 ]), then g acts freely on the set of V -valued points of Spec(R1 [ p1 ]).\n180\n\n\fProof: We just have to add that any V -valued point of Spec(R) (resp. of Spec(R1 ))\nlifts uniquely to a V -valued point of Spec(RP D ) (resp. of Spec(R1P D )).\nG\nG\n2.4.1. The case p = 2. We assume now p = 2. Let Tdef\n(resp. Tfil\n) be the tangent\nspace of R/pR (resp. of R1 /pR1 ), viewed as a dd((M, \u03c6, G)) dimensional affine space\nover k. Its k-valued points are in one-to-one correspondence to lifts of the maximal point\nSpec(k) \u2192 Spec(R) to a W2 (k)-valued point of Spec(R) (resp. of lifts of F 1 /2F 1 to a\nF 1 -filtration F41 of M/4M defined as usual by a cocharacter of GW2 (k) ), with the lift\nprovided by all xi 's being 0 (resp. by F 1 /4F 1 ) corresponding to the origin. F IL0 gives\nbirth naturally to a k-morphism\nG\nG\nmG\nD : Tdef \u2192 Tfil .\n\nFrom 2.3.18.1 B we get that mG\nD is dominant and finite, generically obtained by using a\ncomposite of extensions of degree 2.\nLet CR be the Shimura filtered F -crystal with tensors over Spec(R/pR) associated\nto DR . We have:\nClaim. If k = k\u0304, then the induced map at the level of k-valued points mG\nD (k) :\nG\n\u2192 Tfil\n(k) is surjective and all its fibres have the same number of elements which\nis a non-negative, integral power of 2.\n\nG\nTdef\n(k)\n\nProof: This is a consequence of 2.3.18.1.1.2. We now include a more useful second\nproof, based on 2.2.21 UP. It is more convenient to work with W (k)-valued points instead\nof W2 (k)-valued points (cf. 2.3.18.1 D).\nSo let zi : Spec(W (k)) \u2192 Spec(R), i = 1, 2, be two different W (k)-morphisms giving\nbirth to the same filtration F01 := Fz11 = Fz12 of M (if such W (k)-morphisms do not\nexist we have nothing to prove). From 2.2.21 UP we deduce the existence of a unique\nW (k)-isomorphism z12 : Spec(R)\u2192Spec(R)\n \u0303\nsuch that:\ni) z12 \u25e6 z2 = z1 , and\n\u2217\n(CR ) is isomorphic to CR , under an isomorphism i12 lifting (in z2 ) the canonical\nii) z12\nidentification (M0 , Fz12 , \u03c6, G, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ) = (M0 , Fz11 , \u03c6, G, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ).\nAs CR has no automorphism whose pull back through z2 is the identity, the isomorphism i12 is canonical. So from 2.2.21 UP and from i) and ii) we get:\na) z12 does not fix any W (k)-valued point of Spec(R);\nb) For any z \u2208 Spec(R)(W (k)), the F 1 -filtrations of M defined by z and z12 \u25e6 z are\nthe same;\nc) If we have a third point z3 (not necessarily different from z1 or z2 ) such that\n1\nFz3 = F01 , then z12 \u25e6 z23 = z13 (the convention being that z13 or z23 is the identity\nautomorphism of Spec(R) if respectively z1 = z3 or z2 = z3 ).\nG\nIn other words, if \u03b1 \u2208 Tfil\n(k) is defined by Fz11 /4Fz11 , we have an injective map\n(thought as a monodromy map)\n\u22121\nmz1 : mG\n(\u03b1) \u0592\u2192 AutW (k) (Spec(R)),\nD (k)\n\n181\n\n\fwhich takes the element of mD (k)\u22121 (\u03b1) defining z3 into z13 . The image of mz1 does not\ndepend on z1 (cf. a) and b)). So all fibres of mG\nD (k) have the same number of elements.\nSo the Claim follows from the sentence on extensions of degree 2 before it.\n2.4.2. Corollary. z12 is an automorphism of order 2.\nProof: The fact that z12 is of finite order is implied by the finiteness of the fibres\nof mG\nD (k) and by its uniqueness. From the fact that the special fibre of DR is a versal\ndeformation, [dJ1, th. of intro.] (the form of it we need is reproved in 3.14 B6 below)\n2\nimplies z12 mod 2 is the trivial automorphism of Spec(R/2R). So z12\nmod 4 is the trivial\nautomorphism of Spec(R/4R) and so (being of finite order) is the trivial automorphism\nof Spec(R).\n\n182\n\n\f\u00a73 The basic results\n\nLet k be a perfect field of characteristic a prime p \u2265 2. Let \u03c3 be the Frobenius\nautomorphism of W (k). Let (M, \u03c6, G) be a Shimura \u03c3-crystal over k (cf. 2.2.8 2)). From\nits very definition, we deduce (see 2.2.8 1) and 2)) the existence of a cocharacter \u03bc : Gm \u2192\nG which produces a direct sum decomposition M = F 1 \u2295 F 0 (with \u03b2 \u2208 Gm (W (k)) acting\nthrough \u03bc on F i as the multiplication with \u03b2 \u2212i , i = 0, 1) such that (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G) is a\nShimura filtered \u03c3-crystal. We also deduce that F 0 and F 1 are proper direct summands\nof M . The G(W (k))-conjugacy class [\u03bc] of the cocharacter \u03bc is uniquely determined by\n(M, \u03c6, G) (cf. Fact 2) of 2.2.9 3)). We consider a family (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J of tensors of T (M )[ p1 ]\n\u0001\nsuch that \u03c6(t\u03b1 ) = t\u03b1 , \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 J , and GB(k) is the subgroup of GL M [ p1 ] fixing t\u03b1 , \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 J .\nIf convenient, one can assume that all tensors t\u03b1 are homogeneous. Let\ng := Lie(G).\nFixing the group G, the family of tensors (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J and the G(W (k))-conjugacy\nclass [\u03bc], any other Shimura \u03c3-crystal (M, \u03c61 , G), with \u03c61 fixing t\u03b1 , \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 J , and\nwith [\u03bc] defining its filtration class, up to isomorphism (cf. 2.2.9 6)), can be put in\nthe form \u03c61 = g\u03c6, with g \u2208 G(W (k)). To see this, we consider two Shimura filtered\n\u03c3-crystals (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ) and (M, F11 , \u03c61 , G, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ) having the same filtration\nclass. Changing the second one by an isomorphism, we can assume F 1 = F11 . But then\n\u03c61 = g\u03c6 with g \u2208 GL(M )(W (k)). As \u03c61 and \u03c6 are both fixing t\u03b1 , \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 J , we get that\nactually g \u2208 G(W (k)). Let\ndM := dimW (k) (M ).\n3.0. The starting setting. We consider Shimura \u03c3-crystals (M, \u03c61 , G) and\nShimura filtered \u03c3-crystals (M, F 1 , \u03c61 , G), with \u03c61 fixing t\u03b1 , \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 J , and with [\u03bc] defining\ntheir filtration class. In other words, we consider Shimura \u03c3-crystals with an emphasized\nfamily of tensors whose class is Cl(M, \u03c6, G, (t\u03b1)\u03b1\u2208J ) (cf. 2.2.22 2)) as well as their lifts.\nOccasionally, for the sake of accuracy, we repeat this. We use freely 2.2.3 3).\nIn 3.1-13 we assume p \u2265 3; see 3.14 for the modifications needed to be made for\np = 2. In 3.1-5, 3.7-9 and 3.11 we mostly deal with the generalization of the classical\nSerre\u2013Tate (ordinary) theory to the context of Cl(M, \u03c6, G, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ); in particular, we\nalso deal with problems involving Newton polygons. In 3.6 (resp. 3.12) we mostly deal\nwith global (resp. local) deformations in the context of Cl(M, \u03c6, G, (t\u03b1)\u03b1\u2208J ). In 3.10 we\nintroduce a language and formulas pertaining to Shimura (adjoint) Lie \u03c3-crystals. In 3.13\nwe mostly deal with truncations mod p in the context of Cl(M, \u03c6, G, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ). Often, in\n3.1-14 we deal as well with more general contexts then the one of Cl(M, \u03c6, G, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ).\n183\n\n\fIn 3.15 we gather different refinements which can be obtained by combining different\nparts of 3.1-14.\nWarning: from now on, without a special reference, we assume p \u2265 3.\n3.1. The first group of basic results.\n3.1.0. Theorem. a) Among all \u03c3-crystals (M, g\u03c6) with g \u2208 G(W (k)) (i.e. among\nall Shimura \u03c3-crystals (M, \u03c61 , G, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ) whose filtration class is defined by [\u03bc]), the\nones which have the smallest Newton polygon P (in the sense that all others have a\nNewton polygon strictly above it) are precisely the ones (M, g0 \u03c6) for which there is a\nShimura filtered \u03c3-crystal (M, F01 , g0 \u03c6, G) such that p0 := W0 (g, g0 \u03c6) is contained in the\nparabolic Lie subalgebra F00 (g) of g formed by elements which take F01 into itself.\nb) For any Shimura \u03c3-crystal (M, g0 \u03c6, G) having P as its Newton polygon, there\nis a unique filtration F01 of M , such that (M, F01 , g0 \u03c6, G) is a Shimura filtered \u03c3-crystal\nsatisfying (with the notations of a)) p0 \u2282 F00 (g).\nc) Among all \u03c3-crystals (M, g\u03c6) with g \u2208 G(W (k)) (i.e. among all Shimura \u03c3crystals (M, \u03c61 , G, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ) whose filtration class is defined by [\u03bc]), the ones which have\nthe smallest Newton polygon LieG (P) (in the sense that all others have a Newton polygon\nstrictly above it) of their attached Shimura Lie \u03c3-crystals (g, g\u03c6), are precisely the ones\nhaving P as their Newton polygon.\n \u0303 such that the Shimura\nd) There is a Shimura filtered F -crystal CF = (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G, f)\nF -crystal we get (cf. Fact 3 of 2.2.10) over a geometric point over the generic point of\nthe scheme over which this CF is, has P as its Newton polygon.\n\u0001\n3.1.1. Definitions. a) Any Shimura \u03c3-crystal M, \u03c61 , G, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J of whose filtration class is defined by [\u03bc] and has P as its Newton polygon, is called a G-ordinary \u03c3crystal (or a Shimura-ordinary \u03c3-crystal or, even better, a (G, [\u03bc], [a])-ordinary \u03c3-crystal,\nas P depends not only on the faithful representation G \u0592\u2192 GL(M ) but also on the filtration class defined by [\u03bc] and on the automorphism class [a] of (g, \u03c61 ) as defined in 2.2.11\n2)).\nb) The formal isogeny type of a G-ordinary \u03c3-crystal (M, g0 \u03c6, G) (resp. such a\nG-ordinary \u03c3-crystal), is called the G-ordinary type or the Shimura-ordinary type (resp.\nis called a G-ordinary \u03c3-crystal) produced by (or attached to) the Shimura \u03c3-crystal\n(M, \u03c6, G) we started with.\nc) A Shimura filtered \u03c3-crystal (M, F11 , \u03c61 , G) such that W0 (g, \u03c61 ) is contained in\nthe parabolic Lie subalgebra of g formed by elements taking F11 into itself, is called\nthe G-canonical lift (or the Shimura-canonical lift) of (the (G, [\u03bc], [a])-ordinary \u03c3-crystal)\n(M, \u03c61 , G). Occasionally, we refer to F11 itself as the G-canonical lift of (M, \u03c6, G). Pairs of\nthe form (D\u22121 (M, F11 , \u03c61 ), (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ) are called Shimura-canonical p-divisible groups over\nW (k), while pairs of the form (D\u22121 (M, F11 , \u03c61 )k , (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ) are called Shimura-ordinary\np-divisible groups (over k).\n3.1.1.1. Exercise. If G = GL(M ), then the G-ordinary type we get is an ordinary\ntype (i.e. its associated Newton polygon has only the slopes 0 and 1). Hint: this should\nbe obvious; if it is not, then look at 3.1.8.1 or at 3.2.3 below.\n184\n\n\fFrom 3.1.0 a) and b) and from defs. 2.2.8 7) and 2.2.9 6) we get:\n3.1.1.2. Corollary. Any endomorphism (resp. automorphism or 1J -automorphism)\nof a Shimura-ordinary \u03c3-crystal over k, is as well an endomorphism (resp. automorphism\nor 1J -automorphism) of its canonical lift.\n3.1.2. Remarks. 1) The terminology G-ordinary \u03c3-crystals and G-canonical lifts\nwas suggested to us by F. Oort and R. Pink in June 1995. It is a convenient terminology\nfor the abstract context; in geometric situations we will use gradually more and more the\nterminology Shimura-ordinary \u03c3-crystals and Shimura-canonical lifts.\n2) The class of Shimura-ordinary \u03c3-crystals is stable under perfect field extensions\n(cf. 3.1.0 b)). So, we speak about a Shimura-ordinary (resp. a Shimura-canonical) pdivisible group over k even if by chance in 3.1.1 c) we do not have a quasi-split reductive\ngroup G.\n3.1.2.1. Convention. Whenever we pass to a perfect field k1 containing k, for not\noverloading the notations, we still use the terminology G-ordinary, instead of GW (k1 ) ordinary (\u03c3k1 -crystals).\n3.1.3. Reformulation of 3.1.0 in terms of sets. 3.1.0 asserts the following five\nthings:\na) Among all Newton polygons of \u03c3-crystals (M, g\u03c6) with g \u2208 G(W (k)), there is one\nP which is the smallest; let AG be the set of g \u2208 G(W (k)) such that the Newton polygon\nof (M, g\u03c6) is P.\nb) Among all Newton polygons of Shimura Lie \u03c3-crystals (g, g\u03c6) with g \u2208 G(W (k)),\nthere is one LieG (P) which is the smallest; let BG be the set of g \u2208 G(W (k)) such that\nthe Newton polygon of (g, g\u03c6) is LieG (P).\nc) AG = BG = CG , where CG is the set of g \u2208 G(W (k)) such that (M, g\u03c6) has the\nproperty that there is a Shimura filtered \u03c3-crystal (M, Fg1 , g\u03c6, G) for which W0 (g, g\u03c6) is\ncontained in the parabolic Lie subalgebra of g formed by elements taking Fg1 into itself\n(i.e. having the property that there is a Shimura filtered \u03c3-crystal (M, Fg1 , g\u03c6, G) whose\n\u0001\nattached Shimura filtered Lie \u03c3-crystal g, g\u03c6, Fg0 (g), Fg1 (g) is of parabolic type in the\nsense of def. 2.2.12 a)).\nd) If g \u2208 CG , then there is a unique lift Fg1 of (M, g\u03c6, G) as in c).\ne) Any Shimura \u03c3-crystal can be deformed (using specific Shimura filtered F crystals) so that it is the specialization of a G-ordinary \u03c3k1 -crystal over a (suitable)\nperfect field k1 containing k.\n3.1.4. Proposition. For any G-ordinary \u03c3-crystal (M, \u03c6\u0303, G), there is a unique\ncocharacter \u03bc\u0303 : Gm \u2192 G producing a direct sum decomposition M = F\u0303 1 \u2295 F\u0303 0 (with\n\u03b2 \u2208 Gm (W (k)) acting through \u03bc\u0303 on F\u0303 i as the multiplication with \u03b2 \u2212i , i = 0, 1) such that\n(M, F\u0303 1 , \u03c6\u0303, G) is a G-canonical lift and all elements of W0 (g, \u03c6\u0303) (resp. of W 0 (g, \u03c6\u0303)) take\nF\u0303 1 (resp. F\u0303 0 ) into itself.\n185\n\n\fFor a first proof of this Proposition see 3.11.1-2 below. A second proof of it can be\nobtained by just copying the proof of a) of 4.4.1 3) below (where we work in the context\nof Shimura varieties of Hodge type) and so, for making \u00a74 as little dependent on \u00a73 as\npossible, it is reproduced only there.\n3.1.5. Exercise. The cocharacter \u03bc\u0303 of 3.1.4, when viewed as a cocharacter of\nGL(M ), is the canonical split of (M, F\u0303 1 , \u03c6\u0303).\nSolution. We can assume k = k\u0304. From 3.11.1 a) or c) below we deduce that we can\nassume G is a torus (cf. also Fact of 2.2.22 1)). So Exercise follows from the functoriality\nof canonical splits (to be compared with 2.2.1.2) and from Corollary of 2.2.9 3).\nA second solution can be obtained using the proof of b) of 4.4.1 3) below. Warning:\n3.1.4-5 are not referred before 4.5, so no vicious circle is created (the terminology of\n3.1.6 below is used in 3.11.2 just to introduce some extra terminology in 3.11.3-4 and\nso in 4.3.8.3). Also 3.1.5 can be deduced from 3.1.4, using just the functorial aspect of\ncanonical split cocharacters (cf. 3.1.1.2 and the Claim of 2.2.3 3)).\nThe uniqueness part of 3.1.4 implies:\n3.1.5.1. Corollary. \u03bc\u0303 is fixed by any automorphism of (M, \u03c6\u0303, G).\n3.1.6. Definition. The cocharacter \u03bc\u0303 of 3.1.4 is called the canonical split (cocharacter) of (M, \u03c6\u0303, G) (or of (M, F\u0303 1 , \u03c6\u0303, G), cf. [Wi]).\n3.1.7. Remark. The whole of 3.1.0-6 (as well as the greatest part \u2013i.e. the\npart which does not mention p-divisible groups or Shimura varieties\u2013 of this chapter\n\u00a73) remains valid in the context of generalized Shimura p-divisible objects over k. See\n3.15.6 and Appendix for reformulation of some of the results in this extended context; one\nexception: 3.4-5 below are organized in such a way that this generalized context is handled\nsimultaneously with the context of (M, \u03c6, G). The extension of 3.2.1.1, 3.2.2, 3.2.3, 3.2.8,\n3.3.1-3 below to generalized Shimura p-divisible objects over k is trivial. But this is not\nquite so for the deformation theory of 3.6: occasionally the deformation theory in the\ngeneralized Shimura context requires some additional arguments (see 3.6.1.6, 3.6.18.7.1\nc), 3.6.18.7.3 C and 3.15.6 below).\nFrom 3.1.0 d) and 2.2.9 9) we get (cf. 3.1.1.1):\n3.1.8. Corollary. Any p-divisible group D over a perfect field k\u0303 of characteristic\np > 2 is the specialization of an ordinary p-divisible group.\n3.1.8.1. Comment. 3.1.8, for the case when D has a quasi-polarization over a field\nextension of k\u0303 was first obtained in [NO]. For the case when the a-number of D is at most\n1 (resp. when the Newton polygon of D has only one slope) see [Oo2] (resp. see [dJO,\n5.15]). The last three loc. cit. handle the case p = 2 as well. The general case, including\nthe case p = 2, though considered to be well known, it is untraceable in the literature.\nIt can be easily deduced from [Fa2, th. 10] through a simple algebraization process (see\n3.6.18.4.1 below for another form of it), based on an elementary analysis of Hasse\u2013Witt\ninvariants. This goes as follows.\n186\n\n\fWe can assume we are in a context involving Shimura \u03c3k\u0303 -crystals, cf. 2.2.9 9).\nSo we use the previous notations of the beginning paragraph of \u00a73, with G = GL(M )\nand k\u0303 = k, but with p \u2265 2. If p = 2 we need to choose F 1 such that (M, F 1 , \u03c6)\nis associated to a 2-divisible group over W (k). Writing GL(M ) = Spec(RGL ) =\n1\nSpec(W (k)[x11 , ..., xdM dM ][ DET\n], with DET as the determinant of the matrix of whose\n\u2227\nentries are the variables xij 's, we choose a Frobenius lift of RGL\ntaking xij into xpij if\ni 6= j, and taking xii \u2212 1 into (xii \u2212 1)p , \u2200i, j \u2208 S(1, dM ).\n\u2227\nWe work with the Frobenius endomorphism of M \u2297W (k) RGL\ndefined by gl(\u03c6 \u2297 1),\n\u2227\nwith gl as the universal element of GL(M )(RGL ). Let g \u2208 GL(M )(W (k)) be such that\ng\u03c6(F 1 ) = pF 1 . So the multiplicity of the slope 0 (resp. 1) for (M, g\u03c6) is dimW (k) (M/F 1 )\n(resp. is dimW (k) (F 1 )). But gl mod p specializes to g mod p. So the Hasse\u2013Witt invariant\nof gl(\u03c6 \u2297 1) over the generic point of the completion of Spec(RGL ) in its origin is as well\ndimW (k) (M/F 1 ). So, based on the construction of 2.2.10 (involving a Shimura filtered\n \u0303 the conclusion follows from 2.2.21 UP.\nF -crystal (M, F 1 , \u03c6, GL(M ), f)),\nThe same proof works to show that any principally quasi-polarized p-divisible group\nover k\u0303 is the specialization of a principally quasi-polarized, ordinary p-divisible group.\n3.2. The outline of the proof of 3.1.0. As the proof of 3.1.0 involves a couple\nof pages, we start outlying its main features.\n3.2.1. Lemma. If (N, \u03c6i ), i = 1, 2, are two \u03c3-crystals over k such that \u2200m \u2208 N,\n\u03c6m\n=\nhm \u03c6m\n1\n2 , with hm \u2208 GL(N )(W (k)), then they have the same Newton polygon.\nMoreover, \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 [0, \u221e) we have W\u03b1 (N, \u03c61 ) = W\u03b1 (N, \u03c62 ).\nm\nProof: The condition \u03c6m\n1 = hm \u03c62 , with hm \u2208 GL(N )(W (k)), implies that the\nm\nHodge numbers of the \u03c3 m -crystals (N, \u03c6m\n1 ) and (N, \u03c62 ) are the same. But the Newton\npolygon of a \u03c3-crystal is determined by the Hodge numbers of its iterates [Ka2, 1.4.4].\nThis takes care of the first part.\nTo see the second part we can assume k = k\u0304. Let r \u2208 N be such that \u03c6ri acts\ndiagonally w.r.t. a B(k)-basis {ei1 , ..., ein} of N \u2297W (k) B(k) formed by elements of N \\ pN ,\ni \u2208 {1, 2}; here n := dimW (k) (N ). Let iN \u2208 N \u222a {0} be such that, \u2200i \u2208 {1, 2}, piN N is\ncontained in < ei1 , ..., ein >. We assume that if l, s \u2208 S(1, n), with l < s, then \u03c6ri (eil ) =\ni\ni\npnl eil and \u03c6ri (eis ) = pns eis , with nil and nis non-negative integers such that nil \u2265 nis . Let SL\nbe the finite set of slopes of (N, \u03c61 ) or of (N, \u03c62 ). Let \u03b1 \u2208 SL. Let Wi (\u03b1) := W\u03b1 (N, \u03c6i ).\nWe use mathematical induction on the decreasing values of elements of SL to show that\nW1 (\u03b1) = W2 (\u03b1).\nWe assume that \u2200\u03b2 \u2208 SL, with \u03b2 > \u03b1, we have W1 (\u03b2) = W2 (\u03b2). We need to show\nW1 (\u03b1) = W2 (\u03b1). Let t \u2208 S(0, n) be such that {ei1 , ..., eit} is a B(k)-basis of Wi (\u03b20 ), with\n\u03b20 as the smallest element of SL \u2229 (\u03b1, \u221e) (t = 0 iff this last intersection is the empty\nset). Let s \u2208 S(1, n) be such that {ei1 , ..., eis} is a B(k)-basis of Wi (\u03b1), i = 1, 2; we have\ns > t. For q \u2208 {t + 1, ..., s} we write\n\ne1q\n\n=\n\nn\nX\n\ncl,q e2l ,\n\nl=1\n\n187\n\n\fwith cl,q \u2208 B(k). We apply the hypothesis with m running through all positive multiples\nof r; so let m = rm0 , with m0 \u2208 N. We get\n1\n1\npm0 nq h\u22121\nm (eq )\n\n(HY P )\n\n=\n\nn\nX\n\n2\n\n\u03c3 m (cl,q )pm0 nl e2l .\n\nl=1\n\n2\n\n1\n\nSo piM \u03c3(cl,q )pm0 (nl \u2212nq ) \u2208 W (k), \u2200l \u2208 S(1, n). Taking m0 \u2208 N big enough (we need\nm0 \u2212 iM to be greater than the greatest p-adic valuation of all these coefficients cl,q ), we\nget: if cl,q 6= 0, then n2l \u2265 n1q . But\nn1\nn2u\nn1\n< \u03b1 = t+1 = s ,\nr\nr\nr\nif u \u2208 S(s + 1, n). So cl,q = 0 for l \u2208 S(s + 1, n). We deduce e1q \u2208 W2 (\u03b1). We conclude\nW1 (\u03b1) \u2282 W2 (\u03b1). By reasons of dimensions we get W1 (\u03b1) = W1 (\u03b1). This proves the\nLemma.\n3.2.1.1. Corollary. If (N, \u03c6i , GN ), i = 1, 2, are two Shimura \u03c3-crystals such that\nm\n\u2200m \u2208 N, \u03c6m\n1 = hm \u03c62 , with hm \u2208 GN (W (k)), then, \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 Q, W\u03b1 (Lie(GN ), \u03c6i ), does\nnot depend on i \u2208 {1, 2}; so the Newton polygon of (Lie(GN ), \u03c6i ), does not depend on\ni \u2208 {1, 2}.\nProof: We just need to apply 3.2.1 to the \u03c3-crystals (Lie(GN ), p\u03c6i ), i \u2208 {1, 2}.\n3.2.2. The trivial situation. We come back to the Shimura filtered \u03c3-crystal\n(M, F 1 , \u03c6, G) considered in the beginning of \u00a73. For the meaning of F 0 (g) and F 1 (g) see\n2.2.8 1). The following assertions are (obviously) equivalent:\na)\nb)\nc)\nd)\n\nF 1 (g) = {0};\nF 0 (g) = g;\nthe cocharacter \u03bc : Gm \u2192 G factors through the center of G;\nthe G(W (k))-conjugacy [\u03bc] of \u03bc has a unique representative \u03bc : Gm \u2192 G.\n\nIf these four assertions are true (for instance, this is so if G is a torus), then for\nany g \u2208 G(W (k)), \u03c6 \u25e6 g = g1 \u25e6 \u03c6, with g1 \u2208 G(W (k)). By induction, \u2200m \u2208 N we have\n(g \u25e6 \u03c6)m = gm \u25e6 \u03c6m , with gm \u2208 G(W (k)). So in this case, 3.1.0 is a direct consequence\nof 3.2.1 and 3.2.1.1.\n3.2.2.1. Convention. In all that follows till the end of \u00a73, we assume the assertions\na) to d) of 3.2.2 are not true; the only exceptions: in 3.11.1 and 3.11.2 A to C we do\nnot assume this. So (G, [\u03bc]) is a Shimura group pair over Spec(W (k)) (cf. def. 2.2.5).\nHowever, we point out that all results of 3.6, 3.11 and 3.14 below are valid without this\nassumption (for G a torus, these results are either trivial or are not of any real use).\n3.2.3. A special example. Let P be the parabolic subgroup of G having F 0 (g)\nas its Lie algebra. As G is quasi-split, it has a Borel subgroup B. We can assume B\nis a subgroup of P (cf. [Bo2, 21.12] applied to GB(k) and the Fact of 2.2.3 3)). Let\n188\n\n\fT be a maximal torus of B. It contains a maximal split torus of G. As any two such\nmaximal split tori are G(W (k))-conjugate (following the proof of Fact 1 of 2.2.9 3), this\nis a consequence of [Bo2, 15.14]), we can assume \u03bc factors through T ; so \u03bc can be also\nviewed as a cocharacter \u03bc : Gm \u2192 T .\nLet t (resp. b) be the Lie algebra of T (resp. of B). We have inclusions t \u2282 b \u2282 F 0 (g),\nand F 1 (g) \u2282 b. We get \u03c6(t) \u2282 \u03c6(b) \u2282 g. As t/pt does not intersect F 1 (g)/pF 1 (g), \u03c6(t)\nis a direct summand of g.\nLet T0 be a maximal torus of G having \u03c6(t) as its Lie algebra. The existence of T0\nas a maximal torus of G can be checked as follows. A regular element of t[ p1 ] is mapped\nthrough \u03c6 into a regular element of g[ p1 ]. We deduce the existence of a maximal torus\nof GB(k) having \u03c6(t)[ p1 ] as its Lie algebra; we define T0 as its Zariski closure in G. If it\nis a torus of G, then its Lie algebra is automatically \u03c6(t), as \u03c6(t) is a direct summand\nof g. But to verify that indeed T0 is a torus of G we can assume k = k\u0304. As \u03bc factors\nthrough T , it is appropriate to use 2.2.9 8). Writing \u03c6 = a \u25e6 \u03bc( p1 ), a becomes a \u03c3-linear\nautomorphism of M and so of T (M ). We have \u03c6(t) = a(t). As a(t\u03b1 ) = t\u03b1 , \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 J , a\ninduces a \u03c3-linear Lie automorphism of g as well. a takes the Lie algebra of a torus of\nGL(M ) into the Lie algebra of a torus of GL(M ) (easy argument at the level of projectors\nof M onto direct summands of it of rank 1). So (cf. also the part of [Va2, 4.3.9] involving\ntori) T0 is a torus of G.\nAs \u03c6 is a \u03c3-linear automorphism of g[ p1 ], there is a Borel subgroup of GB(k) having\n\u03c6(b)[ p1 ] as its Lie algebra. Its Zariski closure in G is (cf. the Fact of 2.2.3 3)) a Borel\nsubgroup B0 of G. Lie(B0 ) contains \u03c6(b). We recall that any two Borel subgroups\nof G are G(W (k))-conjugate: this can be deduced from [Bo2, 15.14] (applied to Gk )\nand Fact 1 of 2.2.9 3). So there is an element g0 \u2208 G(W (k)) such g0 B0 g0\u22121 = B. Let\nT1 := g0 T0 g0\u22121 \u2282 B. Let k1 be an algebraic field extension of k such that Gk splits over k1 ;\nwe usually take k1 to be k\u0304 or a finite field extension of k. So T and T1 split over W (k1 ). So\nsimilarly, we deduce the existence of g1 \u2208 B(W (k1 )) such that g1 T1 W (k1 ) g1\u22121 = TW (k1 ) .\nLet \u03c60 := g0 \u03c6 and let \u03c40 be the formal isogeny type of the \u03c3-crystal\n\u0001 (M, \u03c60 ). We\nconsider the following Shimura \u03c3k1 -crystal M \u2297W (k) W (k1 ), \u03c61 , GW (k1 ) defined by\n\u03c61 := g1 (\u03c60 \u2297 1).\n\nWe have \u03c60 (b) \u2282 b and \u03c60 (b[ p1 ]) = b[ p1 ]. Similarly, we have\n\u03c61 (b \u2297W (k) W (k1 )) \u2282 b \u2297W (k) W (k1 )\nand\n\u03c61 (t \u2297W (k) W (k1 )) = t \u2297W (k) W (k1 ).\n3.2.4. Implications. Theorem 3.1.0 is a direct consequence of the results 3.2.5-8\nbelow and of the specialization theorem:\n\u2013 3.2.6 and 3.2.7 b) imply 3.1.3 b) and that LieG (\u03c4 ) is the Newton polygon of (g, \u03c60 );\n189\n\n\f\u2013 3.2.6 implies 3.1.3 a) and e) and that P is the Newton polygon attached to \u03c40 ;\n\u2013 3.2.5 implies (via the above interpretation of LieG (\u03c4 )) BG \u2282 AG ;\n\u2013 3.2.7 b) implies AG \u2282 CG \u2229 BG ;\n\u2013 3.2.7 c) implies CG \u2282 AG (so we get AG = BG = CG , i.e. we get 3.1.3 c));\n\u2013 3.2.8 implies 3.1.3 d).\nIn these implications, in order to benefit from the deformation aspect of 3.2.6, we\nused implicitly 3.2.5-7 for other perfect fields containing k.\n3.2.5. Claim. Among all Shimura Lie \u03c3-crystals (g, g\u03c6) with g \u2208 G(W (k)), there is\nno one whose Newton polygon is strictly below the Newton polygon of (g, \u03c60 ). Moreover,\nany \u03c3-crystal (M, g\u03c6), with g \u2208 G(W (k)), having the property that (g, g\u03c6) and (g, \u03c60 )\nhave the same Newton polygon, has the formal isogeny type \u03c40 .\n3.2.6. Lemma. For any g \u2208 G(W (k)) there is a Shimura filtered F -crystal\n \u0303 such that the resulting F -crystal over the algebraic closure of the field\n(M, F 1 , g\u03c6, G, f)\nof fractions of the generic point of the special fibre of the completion of G in its origin,\nhas the formal isogeny type \u03c40 .\n3.2.7. Proposition. a) p0 := W0 (g, \u03c60 ) is contained in F 0 (g).\nb) The Shimura \u03c3-crystals (M, g2 \u03c6, G) (with g2 \u2208 G(W (k))) having \u03c40 as the formal\nisogeny type are precisely the ones which, up to isomorphisms defined by elements of\nG(W (k)), can be extended to Shimura filtered \u03c3-crystals of the form (M, F 1 , p\u0303\u03c60 , G),\nwith p\u0303 a W (k)-valued point of the parabolic subgroup P0 of G satisfying Lie(P0 ) = p0 .\nFor any p\u0303 \u2208 P0 (W (k)), W0 (g, p\u0303\u03c60 ) is p0 (and so it is included in F 0 (g)), and (g, \u03c60 ) and\n(g, p\u0303\u03c60 ) have the same Newton polygon.\nc) Any Shimura filtered \u03c3-crystal (M, F21 , \u03c62 , G) with the property that W0 (g, \u03c62 ) is\ncontained in F20 (g), is such that (M, \u03c62 ) has the formal isogeny type \u03c40 .\n3.2.8. The uniqueness part. The uniqueness of the filtration mentioned in 3.1.0,\nresults from the fact that any two such filtrations are conjugate by an element of G(W (k))\n(cf. Fact 2 of 2.2.9 3)) and from the fact that two G(B(k))-conjugate parabolic subgroups\nof GB(k) , containing the same parabolic subgroup, are the same (cf. [Bo2, 14.22 (iii)]).\n3.2.9. Warning. We present two proofs of 3.2.5-7. The first one ends in 3.4.14 (via\n3.5); from many points of view it is just the generalization of the last two paragraphs\nof 3.1.8.1. The second one ends in 3.7.1-5 for 3.2.6-7 and (cf. 3.3) in 3.4.13 for 3.2.5; it\nrelies on 3.6.0-8.\n3.2.10. An extra set. Let DG be the set of g \u2208 G(W (k)) such that\n(F ORM )\n\ng\u03c60 = g3 p0 \u03c60 g3\u22121 ,\n\n1\nwith p0 \u2208 P0 (W (k)) and with g3 \u2208 G(W (k)) normalizing F 1 /pF 1 . Let DG\n\u2282 G(W (k1 ))\nbe defined similarly but with \u03c60 replaced by \u03c61 .\n\n190\n\n\f3.3. About the proof of 3.2.5. The statement of 3.2.5 is such that we can replace\nk by a finite field extension k1 of it. So by a suitable passage from W (k) to W (k1 ), with\nk1 as mentioned, we can assume G is split. As G is split, we can choose T in 3.2.3 to be\nsplit, and so T0 and T1 are as well split. So we can take g1 \u2208 B(W (k)) to define \u03c61 as in\n3.2.3. We recall that any Borel subgroup of G is its own normalizer in G.\nThe claim 3.2.5 is a direct consequence of the following 4 items.\n3.3.1. There is b \u2208 B(W (k)) such that \u03c60 = b\u03c61 : we can take b = g1\u22121 . Even more,\n\u2200b1 \u2208 B(W (k)) we have \u03c61 b1 = b\u20321 \u03c61 , with b\u20321 \u2208 B(W (k)). Argument: as \u03c60 (b[ p1 ]) =\n\u03c61 (b[ p1 ]) = b[ p1 ], b1 normalizes b[ p1 ] and so b1 \u2208 B(B(k)) \u2229 G(W (k)) = B(W (k)). So by\ninduction on n \u2208 N, we get: \u03c6n0 = b(n)\u03c6n1 , for some b(n) \u2208 B(W (k)).\n3.3.2. We use freely the Fact of 2.2.11.1 and of 2.2.3 3). B is a subgroup of P1 ,\nwhere P1 is the parabolic subgroup of G defined by the equality Lie(P1 ) = W0 (g, \u03c61 ).\nArgument: as b \u2282 F 0 (g), we have \u03c61 (b) \u2282 b; so (b, \u03c61 ) is a \u03c3-crystal having only\nnon-negative slopes and so b \u2282 W0 (g, \u03c61 ).\nMoreover, from 3.2.1.1 and 3.3.1 we get Lie(P1 ) = p0 . So P1 = P0 .\n1\n3.3.3. 3.3.1 implies that g1 \u2208 DG and that DG\nis the right translation of DG by\n= g1 . Let g2 \u2208 G(W (k)). The Newton polygon of (g, g2 \u03c6) is strictly below or equal\nto the one of (g, \u03c60 ) iff g2 \u2208 DG . Warning: this holds without the assumption G is split.\nThe first (resp. second) assertion is proved in 3.4.11 (resp. in 3.4.13).\n\nb\u22121\n1\n\n3.3.4. If g \u2208 DG , then (g, g\u03c60 ) (resp. (M, g\u03c60 )) has the same Newton polygon as\n(g, \u03c60 ) (resp. as (M, \u03c60 )). Argument: we can assume that in 3.2.10, g3 is the identity;\nthen, as in 3.3.1, we have (p0 \u03c60 )n = pn\u22121 \u03c6n1 , with pn\u22121 \u2208 P0 (W (k)) = P1 (W (k)),\n\u2200n \u2208 N, and so 3.2.1 and 3.2.1.1 apply. Here we can replace \u03c60 and DG respectively by\n1\n\u03c61 and DG\n, cf. 3.3.3.\n3.4. Split Shimura Lie \u03c3-crystals. This section and the next one (3.5) are the\nvery heart of the proof of 3.1.0. As a secondary goal of it, we introduce some notations\nand language to be consistently used in the rest of this paper and in the subsequent ones.\nWarning: not all cases to be considered below in 3.4-5 can show up in our context of\nShimura \u03c3-crystals; we have in mind the so called special cases: cases e6) and e7) of\n3.4.3.2, as well as the case d) of 3.4.3.2 with the set A to be introduced in 3.5.1 having\nthree elements or having two elements which via outer automorphisms of g1 are not\nidentifiable (cf. [Sa, p. 458-60] and its obvious passage from R to an arbitrary field of\ncharacteristic 0; see also [De2, 1.3.9-10] or [Se2, \u00a73]). However, all such cases do show\nup in the generalized Shimura context. So, for the sake of completeness and of future\nreferences, in 3.4-5 we treat these cases as well, without any extra comment. The only\ntwo modifications needed to be made in the whole of 3.4-5 in order to accommodate this\ngeneralized Shimura context:\n\u2013 the element h\u0304 of 3.4.0 has to be modified accordingly;\n191\n\n\f\u2013 the g3 elements of 3.2.10 (this is in connection to 3.4.11), 3.4.9 and 3.4.13 have\nto be modified accordingly (see the part of 2.2.14.2 referring to a generalized Shimura\ncontext).\nSo, the reader interested just in the context of Shimura p-divisible groups (i.e. in\nwhat we considered till now in 3.2-3), can entirely ignore these cases.\nWe refer to the situation of the beginning of 3.3: G and T are split and g1 \u2208 G(W (k)).\nWe have a direct sum decomposition\n1\n1 M\n1\ng[ ] = z[ ]\n\u2295i\u2208I gi [ ]\np\np\np\nof Lie algebras over B(k). Here z is the Lie algebra of the maximal subtorus Z(G)0 of\nZ(G), while gi is the Lie algebra of a semisimple subgroup Gi of G, such that\nGad =\n\nY\n\nGad\ni\n\ni\u2208I\n\n(cf. [Ti1, p. 46] applied over k and logically lifted to W (k)), with Gad\ni an absolutely\nsimple, split, adjoint group over W (k), \u2200i \u2208 I. It is defined by a Lie monomorphism\niG : z \u2295\n\nM\n\ngi \u0592\u2192 g\n\ni\u2208I\n\nwhich becomes an isomorphism by inverting p. iG is not always surjective; as we assumed\np \u2265 3, the failure of surjectivity can happen only when p = 3 and there are factors Gi\nof E6 Lie type or when p is arbitrary and there are factors Gi of Al Lie type, with p\ndividing l + 1.\nMoreover, we have a natural isogeny\nZ(G)0\n\nYY\n\nGi \u2192 G\n\ni\u2208I\n\nwhich at the level of Lie algebras defines iG .\n3.4.0. Notations. \u03c61 normalizes z and permutes the factors gi [ p1 ], i \u2208 I, producing\na permutation \u03b3 of I. We write\nY\n\u03b3=\n\u03b3s\ns\u2208J0\n\nas a product of disjoint cyclic permutations \u03b3s . Warning: trivial permutations are allowed, i.e. each i \u2208 I fixed by \u03b3 defines an element si \u2208 J0 such that \u03b3si is the trivial\npermutation of I and so of {i}; for such an i, we still say \u03b3si permutes cyclically the\nsubset {i} of I. As z \u2282 F 0 (g), the \u03c3-crystal (z, \u03c61 ) has all slopes 0. We start working\nwith just one cycle \u03b30 of \u03b3 (so we consider that 0 \u2208 J0 ) permuting cyclically a subset I0\n192\n\n\fof I. We can assume that I0 = S(1, n), n \u2208 N, and that \u03b30 is the permutation: i \u2192 i + 1\n(with n + 1 = 1). Let\nM\ng0 :=\ngi .\ni\u2208I0\n\nWe fix an element g2 \u2208 G(W (k)); let\n\u03c62 := g2 \u25e6 \u03c61 .\nLet h\u0304 : M \u2192 M be the endomorphism defined by: h\u0304(x) = 0 if x \u2208 F 0 and h\u0304(x) = x\nif x \u2208 F 1 . We recall that the cocharacter \u03bc : Gm \u2192 G (of the beginning of \u00a73) produces\na direct sum decomposition M = F 1 \u2295 F 0 , with \u03b2 \u2208 Gm (W (k)) acting through \u03bc on F i\nas the multiplication with \u03b2 \u2212i , i = 0, 1; so\nh\u0304 \u2208 d\u03bc(Lie(Gm )) \u2282 Lie(T ) = t \u2282 End(M ).\n\u0002 \u0003\nLet h\u0304i be the component of h\u0304 in gi p1 (corresponding to the direct sum decomposition\nL\ng[ p1 ] = z[ p1 ] \u2295i\u2208I gi [ p1 ]). If h\u0304i = 0 then gi \u2282 F 0 (g). If h\u0304i 6= 0 then h\u0304i is a semisimple\n\u0002 \u0003\nelement of gi 1p . When viewed as an endomorphism of gi [ p1 ] (via zi \u2208 gi is mapped into\n[h\u0304i , zi ]), its eigenvalues are precisely \u22121, 0 and 1.\n\b\nWe have F 1 (g) = x \u2208 g [h\u0304, x] = x ; so\n(HBAR)\n\n\b\nF 1 (gi ) := F 1 (g) \u2229 gi = x \u2208 gi [h\u0304i , x] = x .\n\n\b\nSimilarly, F 0 (g) = x \u2208 g [h\u0304, x] = 0 or x and so\nLet F j (g0 ) :=\n\nL\n\n\b\nF 0 (gi ) := F 0 (g) \u2229 gi = x \u2208 gi [h\u0304i , x] = 0 or x .\n\ni\u2208I0\n\nF j (gi ), j = 0, 1. We get:\n\n\u0001\n3.4.1. Lemma. The quadruple g0 , \u03c6j , F 0 (g0 ), F 1 (g0 ) is a Shimura filtered Lie\n\u03c3-crystal, j = 1, 2.\nProof: As \u03bc is a cocharacter over W (k), we have F s (gi )/pF s (gi ) \u0001 = gi /pgi \u2229\nF (End(M ))/pF s (End(M )), \u2200s \u2208 {0, 1}. So \u03c6j p1 F 1 (gi ) + F 0 (gi ) + pgi is a direct\n\u0002 \u0003\nsummand of g of rank dimW (k) (gi ) = dimW (k) (gi+1 ); it is included in gi+1 1p and so it\n\u0001\nis gi+1 (\u2200i \u2208 I0 and \u2200j \u2208 {1, 2}). So g0 , \u03c6j , F 0 (g0 ), F 1 (g0 ) is a Lie p-divisible\nQobjectadof\nMF[\u22121,1] (W (k)). It is a Shimura filtered Lie \u03c3-crystal, as the cocharacter of i\u2208I0 Gi ,\nQ\nobtained by composing \u03bc with the natural epimorphism G \u0589 i\u2208I0 Gad\ni , shows that the\nconditions of 2.2.11 1) are satisfied. This ends the proof.\ns\n\n3.4.1.1.\nWe can workPequally well 3.4.1 (as well as all\n\u0001\n\u0001\nP that follows)\nP Remark.\n1\nad\nwith Lie\n=\ni\u2208I0 Gi )\ni\u2208I0 Gi (we have g0 \u2282 Lie(\ni\u2208I0 Gi ) \u2282 g0 [ p ]) or with Lie (\nP\nad\n\u2295i\u2208I0 Lie(Gi ) instead of g0 (cf. 2.2.13); here i\u2208I0 Gi is the semisimple subgroup of G\ngenerated by all Gi 's, i \u2208 I0 .\n193\n\n\f3.4.1.2. The non-trivial context assumption. We assume F 1 (g0 ) 6= 0; otherwise there is nothing to be done (to be compared with 3.2.2): the Newton polygons of\n(g0 , \u03c61 ) and of (g0 , \u03c62 ) have only one slope 0 and so are the same.\n3.4.1.3. A convenient context. Let G\u03030 be the subgroupQof G generated by the\nad\ntorus T and by the semisimple subgroups Gi , i \u2208 I0 . So G\u0303ad\n0 =\ni\u2208I0 Gi . In the same\nway we got iG , we get that g0 is (identifiable with) a Lie subalgebra of Lie(G\u03030 ). As the\ncocharacter \u03bc of 3.2.3 can be viewed as well as a cocharacter of G\u03030 (still denoted by \u03bc),\nwe get (cf. also 2.2.9 1) and 1')) that the triple (M, \u03c61 , G\u03030 ) is a potentially Shimura\n\u03c3-crystal. Moreover, we get a Shimura group pair (G\u03030 , [\u03bc]) over W (k).\n3.4.2.\n\u0001 Slopes (w.r.t. I0 ). Let H2 (resp.\n\u0001 H1 ) be the set of slopes of the isocrystal\ng0 [ p1 ], \u03c62 (resp. of the isocrystal g0 [ p1 ], \u03c61 ). The sets H2 and H1 are subsets of the\nreal interval [\u22121, 1]. We have slope type direct sum decompositions\nM\n1\ngj (\u03b1),\ng0 [ ] =\np\n\u03b1\u2208Hj\n\nwith gj (\u03b1) := W (\u03b1)(g0 [ p1 ], \u03c6j ), j = 1, 2 (cf. 2.2.3 3)). As \u03c6n1 and \u03c6n2 normalize any one\nof gi [ p1 ], i \u2208 I0 , we get:\n(3.4.2.1)\n\ngj (\u03b1) =\n\nM\n\ngj (\u03b1) \u2229 gi\n\ni\u2208I0\n\n\u00021\u0003\n,\np\n\n\u2200j \u2208 {1, 2} and \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 Hj .

Fact. \u2200j \u2208 {1, 2}, the dimension of gj (\u03b1) \u2229gi [ p1 ] does not depend on i \u2208 I0 .\n3.4.3.\u0002 \u0003Roots. Let ti (resp.\n\u0002 \u0003 bi ) be the component of t (resp. of b) in gi ; so\nti := gi \u2229 t p1 (resp. bi := gi \u2229 b p1 ). Let \u2206i be the base of roots defined by the action\n(via inner conjugation) on gi of the image Tiad in Gad\ni of the maximal torus Ti of Gi\nhaving ti as its Lie algebra, corresponding to the Borel Lie subalgebra bi of gi . Let \u03a6i be\nthe set of roots of gi relative to the torus Tiad . So \u03a6i is a finite set of characters of Tiad .\n\u2212\nThen \u03a6+\ni (the set of positive roots) and \u03a6i (the set of negative roots) are defined w.r.t.\n\u2206i .

As \u03c61 (t) = t, \u03c61 permutes the B(k)-vector subspaces g\u0303i (\u03b1)[ p1 ] of g[ p1 ]. We get a\npermutation \u03b3\u03a6 of the disjoint union \u222ai\u2208I \u03a6i . We have\n\u0001\n\u0001\n(1)\n\u03c61 g\u0303i (\u03b1) = psi (\u03b1) g\u0303\u03b3(i) \u03b3\u03a6 (\u03b1) ,\n\nwhere si (\u03b1) \u2208 {\u22121, 0, 1} is such that the cocharacter \u03bc : Gm \u2192 T has the property that\n\u03bc(\u03b2) acts on elements of g\u0303i (\u03b1) as the multiplication with \u03b2 \u2212si (\u03b1) , \u2200\u03b2 \u2208 Gm (W (k)).

So, forgetting the Lie structure, the pair (Lie(P1 ), \u03c61 ) is a\n\u03c3-crystal.\n\n3.4.3.1. The number e (w.r.t.

Let e be the order of \u03c01 . It is very convenient to work\nsimultaneously with the Shimura Lie \u03c3-crystal\n(e)\n\n(ge0 , \u03c6j ),\n(e)\n\nwhere ge0 := g0 \u2295 * * * \u2295 g0 (e summands) and \u03c6j is the \u03c3-linear automorphism of ge0 [ p1 ]\nacting like \u03c6j on any direct summand gi , i \u2208 I0 , of a g0 copy of ge0 , but sending the gn\ndirect summand of the s-th g0 copy to the g1 direct summand of the (s + 1)-th g0 copy,\n(e)\n\u2200s \u2208 Z/eZ.

On multiplicities of \u03b4. The pair (g0 , \u03a802 ) is a \u03c3-crystal. We have\nW (g0 , \u03a802 ) = g2 (\u03b4) \u2229 g0 and W\u22122\u03b4 (g0 , \u03a802 ) = g2 (\u2212\u03b4) \u2229 g0 .

Let m \u2208 N be a multiple of en such\n\nthat\ns := \u22122m\u03b4 \u2208 N.\nWe consider the Zp -submodule M2 (s) of g2 (\u2212\u03b4) \u2229 g1 generated by elements on which Lm\nacts as scalar multiplication with ps . Its rank is dimW (k) (g2 (\u2212\u03b4) \u2229 g1 ). Let N2 (s) be the\nW (k)-submodule of g2 (\u2212\u03b4) \u2229 g1 generated by M2 (s). We can assume Lm (g2 (\u2212\u03b4) \u2229 g1 ) \u2282\ng2 (\u2212\u03b4) \u2229 g1 .\nIt is easy to see (based on 3.4.1 and the definition of \u03b5i 's) that for any x \u2208 g1 \\ pg1 ,\nL (x) \u2208\n/ ps+1 g1 ; moreover, if Lm (x) \u2208 ps g1 , then x mod p belongs to s\u03b51 (if m is big\nenough we also get that x \u2208 g2 (\u2212\u03b4) \u2229 g1 ). In particular, all Hodge numbers of the\n\u03c3 m -linear endomorphism Lm of g2 (\u2212\u03b4) \u2229 g1 are at most s. As the length of g2 (\u2212\u03b4) \u2229\ng1 /Lm (g2 (\u2212\u03b4) \u2229 g1 ) and of N2 (s)/Lm (N2 (s)) as W (k)-modules are the same, we get that\nall these Hodge numbers must be s and so the Fact follows.\nm\n\nA. Corollary. We have N2 (s) = g2 (\u2212\u03b4) \u2229 g1 .\nB. As Lm (N2 ) \u2282 N2 and the slopes of (N2 , Lm ) are all 0, as in the above proof we\nget Lm (N2 ) = N2 . So, if k = k\u0304, N2 is generated by elements fixed by Lm . On the other\nhand, it is well known that N2 /pN2 is \u2229q\u2208N L\u0303q (g1 /pg1 ), where L\u0303 is the truncation mod p\nof the restriction of Lm to g1 .\n3.4.6. Theorem.

Corollary. The fact that this multiplicity is m\u03b4 or not depends only on the\nexpression of g2 mod p.\nBefore proving 3.4.6, we first mention some of its immediate implications. Not to\ncomplicate the notations by introducing extra indices, in 3.4.8-12 below we allow g2 to\nvary as needed.\n3.4.8. Proposition. The Newton polygon of (g0 , \u03c61 ) is not strictly above the\nNewton polygon of any other Shimura Lie \u03c3-crystal of the form (g0 , g2 \u03c61 ), with g2 \u2208\nG\u03030 (W (k)).\nProof: We assume 3.4.8 is false; let g2 \u2208 G\u03030 (W (k)) for which 3.4.8 is not true. As\n\u03b4 \u2208 H1 , from 3.4.4 and 3.4.6 we deduce that the multiplicity of the slope \u03b4 \u2208 H2 for\n(g0 , \u03c62 ) is also m\u03b4 .\nLet P2 be the parabolic subgroup of G\u03030 whose Lie algebra is W0 (Lie(G\u03030 ), \u03c62 ). p\u03c62\ntakes Lie(P2 ) into itself. (SUB) implies that P2 k is included in Pk0 (cf. also the Fact\nof 2.2.11.1); here P 0 is the parabolic subgroup of G\u03030 having F 0 (g) \u2229 Lie(G\u03030 )\u0001 as its Lie\nalgebra. We deduce the existence of an element g3 \u2208 Ker G\u03030 (W (k)) \u2192 G\u03030 (k) such that\nP3 := g3\u22121 P2 g3 is a subgroup of P 0 (to be compared with Fact 1 of 2.2.9 3)). As 3.4.8 is\na statement involving Newton polygons, by replacing \u03c61 by \u00e3\u03c61 \u00e3\u22121 , with \u00e3 \u2208 P 0 (W (k)),\nwe can assume b \u2229 Lie(G\u03030 ) is included in Lie(P3 ).\nLet \u03c63 := g3\u22121 \u03c62 g3 . We can write \u03c63 = g4 \u03c61 , with g4 \u2208 G\u03030 (W (k)). (g0 , \u03c63 ) and\n(g0 , \u03c62 ) have the same Newton polygon. Let B0 be the Borel subgroup of G\u03030 whose Lie\nalgebra is b \u2229 Lie(G\u03030 ). We have B0 \u2282 P 0 , cf. 3.2.3. Repeating the argument of 3.2.3, we\ndeduce the existence of an element g5 \u2208 P3 (W (k)) such that \u03c64 = g5 \u03c63 takes t onto t and\nLie(B0 ) into Lie(B0 ). For s \u2208 N we get \u03c6s4 = p3,s \u03c6s3 , with p3,s \u2208 P3 (W (k)) and p3,1 = g5 ;\nalso \u03c6s4 = b(s)\u03c6s1 , with b(s) \u2208 B0 (W (k)) and b(1) = g5 g4 (all these are as in 3.3.1 and\n3.3.4; the fact that in 3.4.1.3 we are just in a potentially context does not represent an\nobstruction, as we can see moving to k\u0304). This implies Lie(P3 ) = Lie(G\u03030 \u2229 P1 ), cf. 3.2.1.1;\nso P3 = P10 := G\u03030 \u2229 P1 . This implies: (g0 , g2 \u03c61 ) has a lift of parabolic type.\nFrom 3.2.1 and 3.2.1.1 we also get that (g0 , \u03c62 ) and (g0 , \u03c61 ) have the same Newton\npolygon. Contradiction. This ends the proof of the Proposition.\n3.4.9. Corollary. If g2 \u2208 G\u03030 (W (k)) is such that the Shimura Lie \u03c3-crystals\n(g0 , g2 \u03c61 ) and (g0 , \u03c61 ) have the same Newton polygon, then (M, g2 \u03c61 ) and (M, \u03c61 ) have\nthe same Newton polygon and g2 \u03c61 is of the form g3 p1 \u03c61 g3\u22121 , with p1 \u2208 P10 (W (k)) (P10 is\nas in the proof of 3.4.8) and with g3 \u2208 G\u03030 (W (k)) such that mod p it normalizes F 1 /pF 1 .\n3.4.10. Corollary. If h0 \u2208 G\u03030 (W (k)), then the multiplicity of the slope \u03b4 for\n(g0 , h0 \u03c61 ) is less or equal to m\u03b4 . If we have equality, then (g0 , h0 \u03c61 ) and (g0 , \u03c61 ) have\nthe same Newton polygon.\n3.4.9-10 are consequences of 3.4.6 and of the proof of 3.4.8. 3.4.11-12 below result\nfrom 3.4.6-10, by working with all cyclic permutations \u03b3s , s \u2208 J0 , at once (i.e. we work\nwith the direct sum of \u03c3-linear maps \u2295s\u2208J0 \u03a8sj , where \u03a8sj is defined as \u03a80j of 3.4.5 but for\nan arbitrary s \u2208 J0 ).\n199\n\n\f3.4.11. Corollary. If g2 \u2208 G(W (k)) is such that the Shimura Lie \u03c3-crystals\n(g, g2 \u03c61 ) and (g, \u03c61 ) have the same Newton polygon, then the \u03c3-crystals (M, g2 \u03c61 ) and\n1\n(M, \u03c61 ) have the same Newton polygon and g2 \u2208 DG\n(see 3.2.10). Moreover the fact that\n(g, g2 \u03c61 ) has the same Newton polygon as (g, \u03c61 ) depends only on the expression of g2\nmod p.\n3.4.12. Corollary. The Newton polygon of the Shimura Lie \u03c3-crystal (g, \u03c61 ) is\nnot strictly above the Newton polygon of any other Shimura Lie \u03c3-crystal of the form\n(g, g2 \u03c61 ), with g2 \u2208 G(W (k)).\n1\n3.4.13. Remark. 3.4.11-12 remain true if we replace \u03c61 and DG\nby \u03c60 and respectively by DG and we do not assume G is split (assumption made at the beginning of\n3.4). This is an easy consequence of 3.3.1, of the translation part of 3.3.3 and of the fact\nthat two parabolic subgroups of G which over W (k\u0304) are G(W (k\u0304))-conjugate are in fact\nG(W (k))-conjugate (this fact results from [Bo2, 20.9] applied over B(k) and Iwasawa's decomposition of [Ti2, 3.3.2]). So if g2 \u2208 G(W (k)) is such that g2 (\u03c6 \u2297 1) = g3 p0 (\u03c60 \u2297 1)g3\u22121 ,\nwith p0 \u2208 P0 (W (k\u0304)) and g3 \u2208 G(W (k\u0304)) normalizing F 1 \u2297W (k) k\u0304, as every parabolic subgroup is its own normalizer, we get that we can assume g3 \u2208 G(W (k)); this implies\np0 \u2208 G(W (k)) \u2229 P0 (W (k\u0304)) = P0 (W (k)).

With the notations of 3.4.4-5 it is enough to show that\n(0)\n\ndimW (k) (N2 ) \u2264 dimW (k) (\n\n\\\n\ni\u2208I \u03031\n\nr\u03b5 i ) =\n\nm\u03b4\n,\nn\n\nand, if equality holds, then (SUB) is true, with i = 1.\nFor i \u2208 I \u03030 , let \u1e21i := gi \u2297W (k) k. For i \u2208 I \u03031 , let \u03a0\u03b5i be the projector of \u1e211 of whose\nkernel is p\u0304\u03b5i := p\u03b5i \u2297W (k) k and of whose image is r\u0304\u03b5i := r\u03b5i \u2297W (k) k; also we define\ns\u0304\u03b5i := s\u03b5i \u2297W (k) k and q\u0304\u03b5i := q\u03b5i \u2297W (k) k.\nFollowing the image of \u1e211 under the s-th iterate of \u03c8\u030420 , and identifying \u1e21i with \u1e21i \u2297k k\n(the homomorphism k \u2192 k being the Frobenius automorphism \u03c3) with \u1e211 (this is allowed\nas we are dealing here just with images), we come across k-vector spaces of the form\n(1)\n\nhs\n\n\u03a0\u03b5 i s\n\nhs\u22121\n\n\u03a0\u03b5is\u22121 * * *\n\nh2\n\n\u0001\u0001\u0001\n\u03a0\u03b5i2 (h1 r\u0304\u03b51 ) * * * ,\n\nhl\nwhere h1 , . . . , hs \u2208 Gad\n, l = 1, s,\n1 (k). Here and in what follows the left upper index\nmeans inner conjugation by hl : it is used for conjugating groups as well as Lie subalgebras\nor elements of g1 ; except for elements we do not use parentheses, i.e. we write h1 r\u0304\u03b51 instead\nof h1 (r\u0304\u03b51 ), etc. Also, in what follows, to simplify the presentation, we consider k = k\u0304: the\n\n200\n\n\fstatements of 3.4.6 are such that this is allowed. So the homomorphism G1 (k) \u2192 Gad\n1 (k)\nis surjective; accordingly, we always assume h1 , . . . , hs \u2208 G1 (k).\n3.5.0. Computation of N2 \u2297W (k) k. Taking s \u2208 N big enough and a multiple of\nI \u03031 , the k-vector space of (1) becomes nothing else but N2 \u2297W (k) k (cf. 3.4.5.1 B). We\nallow such an s to vary. We first prove (0), i.e. that the dimension\nT of the k-vector spaces\nof (1) computing dimk (N2 \u2297W (k) k) is less or equal to dimW (k) ( i\u2208I \u03031 r\u03b5i ).\n3.5.1. The set A. Let\n\nA := {\u03b5i |i \u2208 I \u03031 }.\nSo \u2229i\u2208I \u03031 r\u03b5i = \u2229a\u2208A ra . The set A can have more than 1 element only when g1 is in case\na), d) or e6). In case d) A has at most 3 elements. In case e6) A has at most 2 elements.\nIn case a) A can have even more than 3 elements but in this case a), regardless of the\nvalue |A| we have\n\\\nra = ra0 \u2229 ra1 ,\na\u2208A\n\nwith a0 (resp. a1 ) as the smallest (resp. as the greatest) element of A. This is so because\nany positive root containing \u03b1a0 and \u03b1a1 in its expression as sums of elements of \u22061 ,\nautomatically contains \u03b1a2 in its expression, for any a2 \u2208 S(a0 , a1 ) (see [Bou2, planche\nI]).\n3.5.2. Notations. Let \u1e201 := G1 k , T\u03041 := T1 k and T\u03041ad := T1ad k (see 3.4.3). We call\nan element w \u2208 \u1e201 (k) normalizing T\u03041 , a Weyl element. For any \u03b5i \u2208 A, let Q\u0304\u03b5i (resp.\nP\u0304\u03b5i ) be the parabolic subgroup of \u1e201 having q\u0304\u03b5i (resp. p\u0304\u03b5i ) as its Lie algebra. It contains\nT\u03041 as it can be checked immediately starting from the Fact of 2.2.11.1.\n3.5.3. The first properties. We study closer a k-linear endomorphism of \u1e211 of\nthe form \u03a0a g \u03a0b , with a, b \u2208 A. We have the following main property:\n(2)\n\nIm(\u03a0a g \u03a0b ) = Im( g\u0303 \u03a0a w\u0303 \u03a0b ), with g\u0303 \u2208 \u1e201 (k) and with w\u0303 a Weyl element.\nWe also have the following inversion property:\n\n(3)\n\n\u03a0a w \u03a0b =\n\nw\n\n\u22121\n\n\u03a0b w \u03a0a w ,\n\nfor any Weyl element w \u2208 \u1e201 (k).\nFor any g \u2208 \u1e201 (k) we have the following elimination property\n(4)\n\nIm(\u03a0a g \u03a0a ) \u2282 Im(\u03a0a ).\n\nProofs: The elimination property is trivial. The inversion property can be checked\neasily, using Weyl's decomposition of \u1e211 w.r.t. T\u03041ad . The proof of (2) is more involved:\nit needs some preliminaries.\n201\n\n\f\u2212\nLet w0 \u2208 \u1e201 (k) be a Weyl element that takes \u03a6+\n1 into \u03a61 (i.e. which takes the Borel\nsubgroup of \u1e201 having b1 \u2297W (k) k as its Lie algebra into its opposite B\u03041opp w.r.t. T\u03041 ). Let\n\u03a0w\u22121 (a) be the projector of \u1e211 of whose kernel is w0\u22121 (p\u0304a ) and of whose image is w0\u22121 (r\u0304a ).\n0\nSo we have\n\u22121\n\u03a0a = w0 \u03a0w\u22121 (a) w0 .\n0\n\nThe Bruhat decomposition of \u1e201 (see [Bo2, 14.12]) allows us to write w0\u22121 g = ba wqb ,\nwith qb \u2208 Q\u0304b (k), with w \u2208 \u1e201 (k) a Weyl element and with ba \u2208 B\u03041opp (k). Lie(B\u03041opp ) is\nincluded in the kernel of \u03a0w\u22121 (a) . As B\u03041opp is the semidirect product of T\u03041 and of its\n0\nunipotent radical, using [Bo2, 14.5 (2)] applied to this unipotent radical (and T\u03041 ), we can\nwrite\nba = b1a b2a\nwhere b1a \u2208 B\u03041opp (k) normalizes the image of \u03a0w\u22121 (a) and b2a is a k-valued point of the\n0\nsmooth, connected, unipotent subgroup of B\u03041opp generated by Ga subgroups normalized\nby T\u03041 and whose Lie algebra is the opposite of the image of \u03a0w\u22121 (a) w.r.t. the action of\n0\nT\u03041ad . Obviously\n1\n1\n\u03a0w\u22121 (a) ba = ba \u03a0w\u22121 (a) .\n0\n\n0\n\nAlso we have\n\n2\n\n\u03a0w\u22121 (a) ba = \u03a0w\u22121 (a) .\n0\n\n0\n\nIn other words, for any xa \u2208 w0\u22121 (r\u0304a ), we have\nb2a\n\n(5)\n\n(xa ) = xa + ya ,\n\nwhere ya \u2208 w0\u22121 (p\u0304a ). To check this, we can assume (cf. loc. cit.) that b2a is a k-valued\npoint of a mentioned Ga subgroup as well as xa \u2208 b1 \u2297W (k) k is normalized by T\u03041 . So\nformula (5) is an immediate consequence of the formulas of [BT, 4.2]. Besides loc. cit.,\nwe just need to remark that this formula (5) is trivial if \u1e201 is of A1 Lie type; the reason\nwe have to remark this is: loc. cit. deals only with pairs of roots whose sum is non-zero.\nWe conclude\n1\n\u03a0w\u22121 (a) ba = ba \u03a0w\u22121 (a) .\n0\n\n0\n\ng\n\nTo compute the image of \u03a0a \u03a0b , we can assume qb is the identity elements. We\nhave:\n\u22121\n\nIm(\u03a0a g \u03a0b ) = Im( w0 \u03a0w\u22121 (a) w0\n0\n\ng\n\n1\n\n\u22121\n\n\u03a0b ) = Im( w0 \u03a0w\u22121 (a) ba w \u03a0b ) = Im( w0 ba w0\n0\n\n1\n\nw0\n\n\u03a0w\u22121 (a) w \u03a0b ).\n0\n\n\u22121\n\nBut this last Im can be rewritten as Im( w0 ba w0 \u03a0a w0 w \u03a0b ). So we can take w\u0303 := w0 w\nand g\u0303 := w0 b1a w0\u22121 . This proves (2).\n3.5.3.1. The proof of inequality (0). We are now ready to prove, in four steps,\nthe first statement of 3.4.6 (i.e. to prove 3.5 (0)). We can assume that any two consecutive\n\u03b5ij and \u03b5ij+1 of 3.5 (1) are distinct (cf 3.5.3 (4)).\n202\n\n\f1) If |A| = 1, we have nothing to prove (i.e. 3.5 (0) is a consequence of the Fact of\n3.4.5.1 and of 3.5.0).\n2) If |A| = 2, then in any sequence hs \u03a0\u03b5is ... h1 \u03a0\u03b51 \"computing\" N2 \u2297W (k) k, we get\na subsequence \u03a0a g \u03a0b , with A = {a, b} and g \u2208 \u1e201 (k). So, we get that dimW (k) (N2 ) \u2264\ndimW (k) (ra \u2229 rb ), provided the inequality\ndimk (\u03a0a (g r\u0304b )) \u2264 dimk (r\u0304a \u2229 r\u0304b )\nis checked. This last inequality can be proved in many ways. Using property (2), we are\nreduced to the case when g is a Weyl element and so\ndimk (\u03a0a (g r\u0304b )) = dimk (r\u0304b ) \u2212 dimk (g r\u0304b \u2229 p\u0304a ) = dimk (r\u0304b ) \u2212 dimk (p\u0304a ) + dimk (g p\u0304b \u2229 p\u0304a )\n(the second equality due to the fact that g is a Weyl element). This proves the first part\nof the following Claim:\nClaim. The dimension of \u03a0a (g r\u0304b ) is maximal precisely when the dimension of the\nintersection g p\u0304b \u2229 p\u0304a of parabolic Lie subalgebras of \u1e211 is maximal, i.e. when the intersection g p\u0304b \u2229 p\u0304a contains a Borel Lie subalgebra of \u1e211 .\nProof: The Fact of 2.2.11.2 points out that it is irrelevant if we work with inclusions\nbetween parabolic subgroups of \u1e201 or between inclusions of their Lie algebras: this will\nbe used freely in what follows. If the intersection g p\u0304b \u2229 p\u0304a contains a Borel Lie subalgebra\nof \u1e211 , then this intersection has the same dimension as the intersection p\u0304b \u2229 p\u0304a . Argument:\nwe can assume Lie(B\u03041 ) \u2282g p\u0304b \u2229 p\u0304a and so the statement follows from [Bo2, 14.22 (iii)].\nSo if dimk (g p\u0304b \u2229 p\u0304a ) < dimk (p\u0304b \u2229 p\u0304a ), then g p\u0304b \u2229 p\u0304a does not contain the Lie algebra of\na Borel subgroup of \u1e201 . Based on this, the part of the Claim pertaining to \"i.e.\" can\nbe checked easily, case by case, starting from the fact that g is a Weyl element and from\n[Bou2, planche I, IV and V].\nThe case A = {1, l \u2212 1}, with g1 of Dl Lie type, is treated for the sake of convenience\nin the fourth paragraph of 4) below. The case e6) is left as an exercise: though in [Bou2,\nplanche V] the structure of the Weyl group associated to the E6 Lie type is not given,\nthis exercise can be solved in the same manner as the two cases below, by working not\nin terms of vectors \u03b5i 's (of loc. cit.) but directly in terms of roots; however see [Bou2,\np. 219 and Exc. 2) of \u00a74 of ch. VI] (also the case e6) can be checked immediately using\ncomputers). We are left with the following two cases.\nCase 1: g is of Al Lie type. So A = {i0 , i1 } with 1 \u2264 i0 < i1 \u2264 l + 1. We can\nassume b = i0 and a = i1 , cf. 3.5.3 (3). For this paragraph we use the notations of [Bou2,\nplanche I]: so \u03b5i 's are not any more some integers in the set S(0, l) but some vectors\nin Rl+1 . The roots \u03b2 \u2208 \u03a6\u2212\n1 such that g\u03b2 \u2282 rc , with c \u2208 A, are of the form \u2212\u03b5i + \u03b5s ,\nwith i \u2264 c < s \u2264 l + 1. We consider a Weyl element h \u2208 \u1e201 (k). By abuse of notation,\nwe identify it with an element of the Weyl group of loc. cit.; so we identify it with a\npermutation h of the set S(1, l + 1) via the formula h(ei ) = eh(i) .\nSo the intersection h r\u0304i0 \u2229 r\u0304i1 has as many elements as the number of pairs (i, j) such\nthat i \u2264 i0 < j and h(i) \u2264 i1 \u2264 h(j). Obviously the number of such pairs is of the form\n203\n\n\f\u01290 (l + 1 \u2212 \u01291 ), where \u01290 \u2208 S(1, i0 ) and \u01291 \u2208 S(i1 , l + 1), and so it is at most i0 (l + 1 \u2212 i1 ).\nThe equality holds precisely when h maps the set S(1, i0 ) into the set S(1, i1 ) and maps\na subset of the set S(i0 + 1, l + 1) onto the set S(i1 + 1, l + 1). But it is easy to see that\nany such permutation can be written as a product h = h1 h2 , where h2 (resp. h1 ) is the\npermutation of S(1, l+1) leaving invariant each one of the sets S(1, i0 ) and S(i0 +1, l+1)\n(resp. each one of the sets S(1, i1 ) and S(i1 + 1, l + 1)). As any Weyl element defining\nh2 (resp. h1 ) normalizes pi0 (resp. pi1 ), h p\u0304i0 \u2229 p\u0304i1 contains the Lie algebra of a Borel\nsubgroup of \u1e201 and we are through.\nCase 2: A = {l \u2212 1, l}, with g1 of Dl Lie type. For this paragraph we use the\nnotations of [Bou2, planche IV]. We have:\n\u2013 the roots of \u03a6\u2212\n1 corresponding to the action (via inner conjugation) of T\u03041ad on\nr\u0304l\u22121 are either of the form \u2212\u03b5i + \u03b5l , with 1 \u2264 i < l, or of the form \u2212(\u03b5i + \u03b5j ), with\n1 \u2264 i < j < l;\n\u2013 the roots of \u03a6\u2212\n1 corresponding to the action (via inner conjugation) of T\u03041ad on r\u0304l\nare of the form \u2212(\u03b5i + \u03b5j ), with 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 l.\nWe assume b = l. We consider a Weyl element h \u2208 G\u03031 (k); we identify it with an\nelement of the Weyl group WDl of loc. cit. If h sends \u03b5l into \u03b5l , then the intersection\nh\nelements, with equality iff h leaves invariant the set\nr\u0304b \u2229 r\u0304a has at most (l\u22122)(l\u22121)\n2\n{\u03b51 , ..., \u03b5l\u22121 }; in such a case h normalizes both p\u0304a and p\u0304b .\nIf h sends \u03b5l into \u2212\u03b5l , then the intersection h r\u0304b \u2229r\u0304a has s+ (s\u22121)s\nelements, where s is\n2\nthe number of elements i \u2208 S(1, l\u22121) such that h(\u03b5i ) \u2208 {\u03b51 , ..., \u03b5l\u22121 }; as s \u2264 l\u22122 (cf. the\nstructure of WDl as a semidirect product mentioned in loc. cit.), this number is less or\nequal to (l\u22122)(l\u22121)\n, with equality iff s = l \u2212 2. If s = l \u2212 2, let h2 \u2208 WDl be the involution\n2\n(\u03b5l , \u03b5i0 ), where i0 \u2208 S(1, l \u2212 1) is the unique element such that h(\u03b5i0 ) \u2208 {\u2212\u03b51 , ..., \u2212\u03b5l\u22121 }\n(so h(\u03b5i0 ) = \u2212\u03b5i0 ). We have: h2 (resp. hh\u22121\n2 ) normalizes p\u0304b (resp. p\u0304a ).\nIf h sends \u03b5l into an element of the set {\u2212\u03b51 , ..., \u2212\u03b5l\u22121 }, then the intersection h r\u0304b \u2229r\u0304a\nhas s+ s(s\u22121)\nelements, where s is the number of elements of the set {\u03b51 , ..., \u03b5l\u22121 } mapped\n2\nthrough h into this set. As s \u2264 l\u22122, this number is less or equal to (l\u22122)(l\u22121)\n. If s = l\u22122,\n2\nthen h normalizes p\u0304a . If h sends \u03b5l into \u03b5j , with j \u2208 S(1, l \u2212 1), then the intersection\nh\nelements, where s is the number of i \u2208 S(1, l \u2212 1) such that\nr\u0304b \u2229 r\u0304a has s + (s\u22121)s\n2\nh(\u03b5i ) \u2208 {\u03b51 , ..., \u03b5j\u22121 , \u03b5j+1 , ..., \u03b5l\u22121 }; as s \u2264 l \u2212 2, this number is less or equal to (l\u22122)(l\u22121)\n,\n2\nwith equality iff s = l \u2212 2. If s = l \u2212 2, then h normalizes p\u0304b .\nSo in all cases h p\u0304b \u2229 p\u0304a contains the Lie algebra of a Borel subgroup of \u1e201 and we\nare through.\nThis proves the Claim.\nFrom Claim and the first paragraph of its proof we get: dimk ( g p\u0304b \u2229 p\u0304a ) \u2264 dimk (p\u0304b \u2229\np\u0304a ).\n3) If |A| \u2265 3, then using repeatedly properties (2) and (3), we can bring together a\nshort sequence of the form \u03a0a g \u03a0b , if g1 is in case a), with a the smallest element of A\n204\n\n\fand with b the greatest element of A, or of the form \u03a0a g \u03a0b h \u03a0c if g1 is in case d), with\nA = {a, b, c}. This proves 3.5 (0) if g1 is in case a) (cf. 2)).\n4) We assume we are in case d) with |A| = 3.\nLet g1 be of Dl Lie type (l \u2265 4). So A = {1, l \u2212 1, l}. Using property (2), we can\nassume \u03a0a g \u03a0b h \u03a0c is such that h is a Weyl element. Due to the circular form of the\nexpressions of 3.5 (1), we can assume c = 1 and b = l \u2212 1. But in this case the dimension\nof the image of \u03a0a g \u03a0b h \u03a0c is less or equal to\nl \u2212 2 = dimk (r\u0304a \u2229 r\u0304b \u2229 r\u0304c ).\nTo check this, we use the notations of loc. cit. We have:\n\u2013 the roots of \u03a6\u2212\n1 corresponding to the action (via inner conjugation) of T\u03041ad on r\u03041\nare of the form \u2212\u03b51 \u00b1 \u03b5j , with 2 \u2264 j \u2264 l.\nSo if the element h of the Weyl group of loc. cit. sends \u03b51 into an element of the set\n{\u2212\u03b51 , \u2212\u03b52 , . . . , \u2212\u03b5l\u22121 , \u03b5l } then we have r\u0304l\u22121 \u2229 h r\u03041 = {0} and we are done. If h sends \u03b51\ninto an element \u03b5i0 \u2208 {\u03b51 , \u03b52 , . . . \u03b5l\u22121 , \u2212\u03b5l }, then r\u0304l\u22121 \u2229 h r\u03041 has dimension exactly l \u2212 1.\nIf dimk (r\u0304l\u22121 \u2229 h r\u03041 ) = l \u2212 1, then h = h1 h2 where h1 is the transposition (\u03b51 , \u03b5i0 ) and\nwhere h2 := h\u22121\n1 h fixes \u03b51 . As h2 (resp. h1 ) normalizes r\u03041 and p\u03041 (resp. r\u0304l\u22121 and p\u0304l\u22121 )\nthe intersection q\u0304l\u22121 \u2229 h q\u03041 contains a Borel subalgebra of \u1e211 .\nThe arguments of the proof of (2) show that we can assume g is a Weyl element as\nwell. So we can apply the same arguments as in the\n\u0001 proof of Case 2 of the Claim of 2),\ng\nh\nin order to conclude that dimk r\u0304l \u2229 (r\u0304l\u22121 \u2229 r\u03041 ) is at most l \u2212 2. Briefly, this goes\nas follows. We can assume h is the identity element. If g sends \u03b51 into {\u2212\u03b51 , ..., \u2212\u03b5l },\u0001\nthen r\u0304l \u2229 g (r\u0304l\u22121 \u2229 r\u03041 ) = {0}. If g sends \u03b51 into {\u03b51 , ..., \u03b5l}, then dimk r\u0304l \u2229 g (r\u0304l\u22121 \u2229 r\u03041 )\nis equal to the number of elements of the set {\u2212\u03b52 , ..., \u2212\u03b5l\u22121 , \u03b5l } sent by g into the set\n{\u2212\u03b51 , ..., \u2212\u03b5l\u22121 , \u2212\u03b5l }. Based on the structure of the Weyl group WDl we get that the\nnumber of such elements is at most l \u2212 2. If it is l \u2212 2, we distinguish two situations.\nIf \u03b51 is sent by g into \u03b5l , then g normalizes p\u0304l . If \u03b51 is sent by g into \u03b5s , with s \u2208\nS(1, l \u2212 1), we write g as g1 g2 , with g2 as the Weyl element which leaves invariant each\n\u03b5i , i \u2208 S(1, l \u2212 1) \\ {s0 } and which sends \u03b5l into the same element \u2212\u03b5s0 as g does. g1\n(resp. g2 ) normalizes p\u0304l (resp. p\u0304l\u22121 \u2229 p\u03041 ).\nThis ends the proof of 3.5 (0) and so of the first statement of 3.4.6.\n3.5.4. The proof of (SUB). We assume now dimW (k) (N2 ) = mn\u03b4 . To prove (SUB)\nwe first remark:\n\u0001\n\u0001\nFact. The Lie subalgebra g2 (\u2212\u03b4) \u2229 g1 \u2297W (k) k of\u0001 \u1e211 is of the form g \u2229a\u2208A s\u0304a , with\nT\ng \u2208 P\u0304\u03b51 (k), and so its normalizer in \u1e201 is g a\u2208A P\u0304a \u2282 P\u0304\u03b51 .\n\u0001\nProof: We start pointing\nout:\nif\nthe\nLie\nsubalgebra\ng\n(\u2212\u03b4)\n\u2229\ng\n\u2297W (k) k of \u1e21\u00011\n2\n1\n\u0001\nT\nis of the form g \u2229a\u2208A s\u0304a , with g \u2208 \u1e201 (k), and if its normalizer in \u1e201 is g \u0001 a\u2208A P\u0304a ,\nthen automatically g \u2208 P\u0304\u03b51 (k). To see this, we first remark that g2 (\u2212\u03b4) \u2229 g1 \u2297W (k) k\nis included in s\u0304\u03b51 = F 1 (\u1e211 ) (cf. the Fact of 3.4.5.1) and so the Lie algebra F 1 (\u1e211 ) being\n205\n\n\f\u0001\nabelian is included in the normalizer of g2 (\u2212\u03b4) \u2229\u0001g1 \u2297W (k) k in \u1e211 . Using Fact of\nT\n2.2.11.1 and [Bo2, 14.22 (i)] we get that g a\u2208A P\u0304a contains a Borel subgroup of P\u0304\u03b51 ;\nusing P\u0304\u03b51 (k)-conjugates, we can assume this Borel subgroup\nis also included in \u2229a\u2208A P\u0304a\n\u0001\nand so [Bo2, 14.22 (iii)] implies \u2229a\u2208A P\u0304a =g \u2229a\u2208A P\u0304a . As any parabolic subgroup of \u1e201\nis its own normalizer, we conclude: g \u2208 P\u0304\u03b51 . So we are left to check:\n\u0001\n\u0001\ng\nClaim. The subspace g2 (\u2212\u03b4)\n\u2229\ng\ns\u0304\n\u2297\nk\nof\n\u1e21\nis\nof\nthe\nform\n\u2229\nand its\n1\na\n1\na\u2208A\nW\n(k)\n\u0001\nT\ng\nnormalizer in \u1e201 is\na\u2208A P\u0304a .\n\nTo prove this Claim we need some preliminaries. Let \u1e21\u03b1 := g\u03b1 \u2297W (k) k. We recall\nthe following three well known properties:\n\na) [\u1e21\u03b1 , \u1e21\u2212\u03b1 ] is a 1 dimensional k-vector subspace of Lie(T\u03041 ) = t1 /pt1 (this is the first\nplace where we need p > 2);\nb) If |A| \u2265 2 and if \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b1 + \u03b2 \u2208 \u03a61 , then \u03b1 and \u03b2 generate a root system of rank 2\nof A2 Lie type (the inequality |A| \u2265 2 implies that all roots of \u03a61 have the same length,\ncf. [Bou2, planche I, IV, and V]);\nc) The differential map of the commutator map ca : \u1e201 \u2192 \u1e201 , defined by ca (g) =\ngag \u22121 a\u22121 is given by the formula dca = 1g1 \u2212 Ad(a) (for instance, cf. [Bo2, 3.16]).\nIf |A| \u2265 2, from [BT, 4.2-3] and b) we get (via c)) the following formula\n(6)\n\n[\u1e21\u03b1 , \u1e21\u03b2 ] = \u1e21\u03b1+\u03b2 ,\n\nwhere \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b1 + \u03b2 \u2208 \u03a61 . It can be as well checked directly, inside the SL-group of a 3\ndimensional k-vector space; it is true even if p = 2 (for an arbitrary simple, adjoint group\nover k). Also, regardless of the value of |A|, from [BT, 4.2-3] we get (again via c)) the\nfollowing inclusion\n(7)\n\n[\u1e21\u03b1 , \u1e21\u03b2 ] \u2282 \u1e21\u03b1+\u03b2 ,\n\nwhere \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 \u03a61 are such that \u03b1 + \u03b2 6= 0; if \u03b1 + \u03b2 \u2208\n/ \u03a61 \u222a {0} then \u1e21\u03b1+\u03b2 := {0}.\nWe are now ready to prove the Claim. We first consider the case when A = {a} has\nonly 1 element. Let\n\u039b1 := {\u03b1 \u2208 \u03a6\u2212\n1 |g\u03b1 \u2282 ra }.\nIn this case, the first part of the Claim is a consequence of the Fact of 3.4.5.1, while for\nthe second part we just need to remark: if xa \u2208 \u2295\u03b1\u2208\u039b1 \u1e21\u03b1 normalizes s\u0304a , then \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 \u039b1 ,\nfrom the inclusion [\u1e21\u2212\u03b1 , xa ] \u2282 s\u0304a , we get, cf. a) and (7), that the component of xa in \u1e21\u03b1\nis 0; so xa = 0.\nIf |A| \u2265 2, in order to benefit from the previous notations, we prove this Claim working with notations involving negative roots: the reductions to Weyl elements performed\nin 3.5.3 allows us to shift from positive to negative roots, as we like. We need to consider\nthree cases.\n206\n\n\fCase 1. If |A| = 2, with A = {a, b}, we just have to show:\nSubfact. If the image of the endomorphism \u03a0a w \u03a0b , with w \u2208 \u1e201 (k) a Weyl ele\u22121\nment, has dimension dimk (r\u0304a \u2229r\u0304b ), then r\u0304b \u2229 w r\u0304a is \u1e201 (k)-conjugate to r\u0304a \u2229r\u0304b , and the\nnormalizer of r\u0304a \u2229 r\u0304b is Q\u0304a \u2229 Q\u0304b .\nThe first part of the Subfact is easy. Argument: Q\u0304a and w Q\u0304b must contain a Borel\nsubgroup of \u1e201 (cf. Claim of 3.5.3.1 2) and Fact of 2.2.11.1); as any two Borel subgroups\nof \u1e201 are \u1e201 (k)-conjugate, we can assume this Borel subgroup is B\u03041opp and so, based on\n[Bo2, 14.22 (iii)], we can assume w Q\u0304b = Q\u0304b . For the second part of it, as any parabolic\nsubgroup of a reductive group over k is connected, it is enough to show that the Lie\nsubalgebra of \u1e211 normalizing r\u0304a \u2229 r\u0304b is Lie(Q\u0304a \u2229 Q\u0304b ). To check this, let\n\u039b2 := {\u03b1 \u2208 \u03a6+\n1 |g\u03b1 \u2282 sa \u222a sb }.\nLet xab \u2208 \u2295\u03b1\u2208\u039b2 \u1e21\u03b1 normalizing r\u0304a \u2229 r\u0304b . Let \u03b1 \u2208 \u039b2 . Let \u03b2 \u2208 \u03a6\u2212\n1 be such that:\ni) g\u03b2 \u2282 ra \u2229 rb ;\nii) either \u03b2 + \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a61 or \u03b2 = \u2212\u03b1.\nThe existence of such a root can be read out from [Bou2, planche I, IV and V]. We\ninclude a discussion case by case, in a way needed to be used in 3.14 C (in connection to\nthe p = 2 case).\nPq\nIf we are in case a) with a < b and \u03b1 = s=m \u03b1s , where either m \u2264 a and q \u2265 a\nPmax{q,b}\nor\nm\n\u2264\nb\nand\nq\n\u2265\nb,\nthen\nwe\ntake\nrespectively\neither\n\u03b2\n=\n\u2212\u03b1s or \u03b2 =\ns=m\nPq\ns=min{m,a} \u2212\u03b1s .\nP6\nIf we are in case e6) with 1 = a < b = 6 and \u03b1 = s=1 bs \u03b1s , where bs \u2208 {0, 1, 2, 3}\nand\nP5 either b1 or b6 is 1, then we can assume b1 = 1 and so we take \u03b2 = \u2212\u03b11 \u2212 \u03b16 \u2212\n( s=2 cs \u03b1s ) where:\n\u2013 c3 = c4 = c5 = 1 and c2 = 0 if b2 = b6 = 0;\n\n\u2013 ci = 1, i = 2, 5, if b2 = 1 and b6 = 0;\n\u2013 ci = bi , i = 2, 5, if b6 = 1.\nFor an exemplification in 3.14 C below, we also point out that we can also take:\n\u2013 ci = 1, i = 2, 5, if b2 = 0 and b6 = 1;\n\u2013 c2 = 1 and c3 = c4 = c5 = 2 if b2 = b6 = 1 and b3 , b4 , b5 \u2208 {1, 2} are such that\neither only one of them is 1 or all three of them are 1;\n\u2013 c2 = c3 = c5 = 2 and c4 = 3, if b6 = b2 = 1 and either b4 = 3 or b4 = 2 and b3 = b5 ;\n\u2013 c2 = 1, c3 = c4 = c5 = 2, if b2 = 2 and b6 = 1.\nIf we are in case d), we need to consider two situations. First we assume A = {1, l \u2212\nPl\u22121\nPl\u22121\n1}. If \u03b1 does not contain \u03b1l in its expression, we take \u03b2 = \u2212 s=1 \u03b1s ; if \u03b1 = s=1 \u03b1s\nthen we can also take \u03b2 = \u2212\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b1l . If \u03b1 does not contain \u03b1l\u22121 in its expression but it\n207\n\n\fPl\nPl\ndoes contain \u03b11 , then we take \u03b2 = \u2212 s=1 \u03b1s . If \u03b1 = s=s0 \u03b1s , with s0 \u2265 2, or if \u03b1\nPl\nis the maximal root, then we take \u03b2 = \u2212 s=1 \u03b1s . If \u03b1 contains \u03b1l , \u03b1l\u22121 and \u03b11 in its\nexpression but is not the maximal root, then we take \u2212\u03b2 to be this maximal root. If \u03b1\ncontains \u03b1l , \u03b1l\u22121 and \u03b1s0 in its expression, with s0 \u2265 2, and does not contain \u03b1s1 , for\nPs0 \u22121\nany s1 \u2208 S(1, s0 \u2212 1), then we take \u03b2 = \u2212\u03b1 \u2212 s=1\n\u03b1s .\n\nWe consider now the case A = {l \u2212 1, l}. We can assume \u03b1 contains \u03b1l\u22121 in its\nexpression. If \u03b1 does not contain \u03b1l in its expression and it is different from \u03b1l\u22121 , then\nPl\nwe take \u03b2 = \u2212\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b1l . If \u03b1 = \u03b1l\u22121 , then we take \u03b2 = \u2212 s=l\u22122 \u03b1s . If \u03b1 contains \u03b1l in its\nexpression, then, not to introduce an s0 as above, we can assume \u03b1 contains as well \u03b11\nin its expression; so the choice of the previous paragraph of \u03b2 in such a situation applies\nas well in the context of A = {l \u2212 1, l}.\n\nWe now come back to xab . From the inclusion [\u1e21\u03b2 , xab ] \u2282 r\u0304a \u2229 r\u0304b , from formulas (6)\nand (7), from property a) and from i) and ii) we get that the component of xab in \u1e21\u03b1 is\n0. So xab = 0.\nCase 2. If |A| \u2265 3 and g1 is of Al Lie type, then we have to work with \u03a0a w \u03a0b ,\nwith a and b the smallest and respectively the greatest element of A and with w \u2208 \u1e201 (k)\na Weyl element. So this case gets reduced to the case |A| = 2.\nCase 3. If |A| = 3 and g1 is of Dl Lie type, then we have to work with \u03a0a w \u03a0b w0 \u03a0c ,\nwhere A = {a, b, c} and w, w0 \u2208 G1 (k) are both Weyl elements (cf. end of 3.5.3.1 4)).\nThe same argument at the level of Lie algebras as in Case 1 applies: based on 3.5.3.1\n4), we just need to show that the normalizer of r\u0304a \u2229 r\u0304b \u2229 r\u0304c is Q\u0304a \u2229 Q\u0304b \u2229 Q\u0304c . To get\nthis we just need to replace everywhere (in Case 1) ra \u2229 rb by ra \u2229 rb \u2229 rc , r\u0304a \u2229 r\u0304b by\nr\u0304a \u2229 r\u0304b \u2229 r\u0304c , Q\u0304a \u2229 Q\u0304b by Q\u0304a \u2229 Q\u0304b \u2229 Q\u0304c , s\u0304a \u222a s\u0304b by s\u0304a \u222a s\u0304b \u222a s\u0304c and xab by xabc . The\nexistence of a root \u03b2 in this case is argued entirely as in the d) case of Case 1. To see\nthis, let \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a6+\ng\u03b1 \u2208 s1 \u222a sl\u22121 \u222a sl . If \u03b1 does not contain \u03b1l\u22121 and \u03b1l in\n1 be such that P\nPl\u22121\nl\nits expression, we take \u03b2 = \u2212 i=1 \u03b1i . If \u03b1 = i=s , with s \u2208 S(1, l \u2212 1), then we take\nPl\nPl\u22122\n\u03b2 = \u2212 i=1 \u03b1i \u2212 i=s \u03b1i . If \u03b1 contains \u03b11 , \u03b1l\u22121 and \u03b1l in its expression, then we take\n\u03b2 as in Case 1 (for when we are in case d)). If \u03b1 contains just \u03b1s 's in its expression, with\nPs0 \u22121\ns \u2208 S(s0 , l), with s0 \u2208 S(1, l \u2212 1), then we take \u03b2 = \u2212\u03b1 \u2212 i=1\n\u03b1i . This ends the proof\nof the Claim and so of the Fact.\n3.5.4.1. End of the proof of\nL 3.4.6. We are now\u0001 ready to prove (SUB). The\nparabolic subgroup of \u1e201 having\n\u03b1\u2208H1 \u2229[0,1] g0 (\u03b1) \u2229 g1 \u2297W (k) k as its Lie algebra\n\u0001\nnormalizes g2 (\u2212\u03b4) \u2229 g1 \u2297W (k) k. So the Fact of 3.5.4 implies that it is included in P\u0304\u03b51 .\nThis ends the proof of (SUB) and so of 3.4.6.\n3.5.5. Variants. It is easy to see that 3.4.1-8, 3.4.10, the logical variants of 3.4.9 and\n3.4.11 (involving, cf. the beginning paragraph of 3.4.0, a generalized Shimura context),\nas well as the whole of 3.5 remain true if, instead of g2 \u2208 G(W (k)) (resp. h0 \u2208 G\u03030 (W (k))\nfor 3.4.10) we work with any inner automorphism of GW (k) (resp. of G\u03030 ). Warning: in\ngeneral this is not so if we use an outer automorphism, as such an automorphism can\n208\n\n\fchange the automorphism class of (g, \u03c6), \"producing\" a different G-ordinary type \u03c4 . In\nparticular, based on 3.4.11 and 3.4.13 we get:\nCorollary. Let g \u2208 Gad (W (k)).\n1) If (g, \u03c60 ) and (g, g\u03c60 ) have the same Newton polygon, then at the level of \u03c3linear Lie automorphisms of g we have g\u03c60 = g3 p4 \u03c60 g3\u22121 , where g3 is a W (k)-valued\npoint of Gad which mod p defines a k-valued point of the parabolic subgroup of Gad having\nF 0 (g)[ p1 ]\u2229Lie(Gad ) as its Lie algebra, and where p4 is a W (k)-valued point of the parabolic\nsubgroup of Gad having Lie(P0 )[ p1 ] \u2229 Lie(Gad ) as its Lie algebra. Moreover, (g, g\u03c60 ) has\na lift of parabolic type.\n2) The fact that (g, \u03c60 ) and (g, g\u03c60 ) have the same Newton polygon or not depends\nonly on the expression of g mod p.\n3) 1) and 2) remain true if instead of g we work with Lie(Gad ). Moreover, we have\nvariants of these for when we work with g0 instead of g or with \u2295i\u2208I0 Lie(Gad\ni ) instead of\nLie(Gad ).\nIn the above Corollary, the role of (g, \u03c60 ) is precisely of an arbitrary Shimura Lie\n\u03c3-crystal having a lift of Borel type.\n3.5.6. An expectation. We expect that the following statement is true:\nExpectation. Let H be a split, semisimple group over an arbitrary field k\u0303. Let\nPH (1),..., PH (n) be n parabolic subgroups of it (n \u2208 N). Then the dimension of the intersection of the Lie algebras of n parabolic subgroups P\u03031 ,..., P\u0303n of H which are respectively\nH(k\u0303)-conjugate to PH (1),..., PH (n), is maximal precisely in the case when there is a\nBorel subgroup of H contained in the intersection \u2229ni=1 P\u0303i .\nThe case n = 2 is easy (to be compared with 3.5.3.1 2)). For n > 2 we can prove it\nin many situations but we do not have a proof which works in the general case.\n3.6. The second group of basic results: global deformations and some\nprinciples for different Fontaine categories. We start constructing global deformations: 3.6.0-11 form a sequence; they deal with global deformations in the context of\nShimura \u03c3-crystals. However, along this sequence some digressions are as well included;\nthey are 3.6.1.1.1 4) and 5), 3.6.1.1.2, 3.6.1.5-6, 3.6.6.2, 3.6.8.1 till 3.6.8.1.5 inclusive,\n3.6.8.3 and 3.6.8.9; these digressions can be looked at just at the needed moments. As\nmentioned in 1.14.5, the readers should look at 3.6.8 from the general point of view from\nthe very beginning. In 3.6.12-14 we deal with the geometric context of a SHS. 3.6.1517 contain complements. 3.6.18-19 deal with different principles of Fontaine categories;\nwarning: the global deformations in the generalized Shimura context are constructed\nin 3.15.6 (cf. also the relative moduli principle of 3.6.18.7.3 C). Some conclusions are\ngathered in 3.6.20.\nWe preserve the previous\nnotations of 3.0-3. Let G = Spec(R) and let g2 \u2208 G(W (k)).\n\u0001\nLet eM := dim GL(M ) = d2M .

Some preliminaries. From now on, till the end of 3.6.8, we assume k is an\ninfinite field. For the case of a finite field see 3.6.9 3).\nR/pR is an integral domain (cf. [Ti2, 3.8.1]). So the intersection U0 \u2229 U2 is nonempty. Moreover, [Bo2, 18.3] guarantees the existence of a dense set of k-valued points\nof (U0 \u2229 U2 )k . We choose a W (k)-monomorphism\nh : Spec(W (k)) \u0592\u2192 U0 \u2229 U2\nsuch that the two W (k)-epimorphisms W (k)[z1 , . . . , zd ] \u0589 W (k) associated to b0 \u25e6 i02 \u25e6 h\nand b2 \u25e6 i20 \u25e6 h (with i02 and i20 as the inclusions of U0 \u2229 U2 into U0 and respectively\ninto U2 ) send zi , i = 1, d, into elements of Gm (W (k)). Composing the W (k)-morphisms\nc0 and c2 with W (k)-automorphisms of Z of the form zi \u2192 ui zi , with ui \u2208 Gm (W (k)),\ni = 1, eM , we can assume that both these two W (k)-epimorphisms send zi to 1, i = 1, d.\nLet U00 , U20 , W00 and W20 be the right translations of U0 , U2 , W0 and respectively\nW2 by h\u22121 . So the W (k)-monomorphism Spec(W (k)) \u0592\u2192 GL(M ) defining 1M factors\nthrough U00 , U20 , W00 and W20 .

So for\nany n \u2208 N, MRj /pn MRj is an object of MF[0,1] (Rj ) and MSj /pn MSj is an object of\nMF[0,1](Sj ).

We also call it the extension of MRj to W (k1 ); we\nview Rj W (k1 ) as a W (k1 )-algebra.\nIn a similar manner we define the pull back of any object (or p-divisible object) of\nMF[\u00e3,b\u0303] (R3 ), with R3 a regular, formally smooth W (k)-algebra for which a Frobenius\nlift of R3\u2227 is chosen (fixed), through a formally \u00e9tale, affine W (k)-morphism Spec(Q\u0303\u2227\n3) \u2192\n\u2227\nSpec(R3 ), or through the natural affine W (k)-morphism Spec(R3W (k1 ) ) \u2192 Spec(R3 ),\nwith k1 as above.\nAll the above terminology conforms to 2.2.1.3.\n\u2227\n3.6.1.1.1.

Warning: the system of equations obtained by\nputting (E1 ) and (E2 ) together, does not depend on the choice of the direct supplement\nF 0 of F 1 in M ; moreover, as we chose \u03a6(Q\u0303j )0 and \u03a6(Q\u0303j )1 to be Frobenius maps (i.e.\ni\nn\n\u03a6Q\u0303j -linear maps) and not Q\u0303\u2227\nj -linear maps, we got m \u2208 F \u2297W (k) Q\u0303j /p Q\u0303j and not in\n\nF i \u2297W (k) \u03c3 Q\u0303j /pn Q\u0303j .\nWe say \u2207 respects the G-action, if \u2200i \u2208 S(1, d), the Q\u0303j /pm Q\u0303j -endomorphism of\nM \u2297W (k) Q\u0303j /pn Q\u0303j that takes m \u2208 M into\n\u2207(\n\n\u2202\n)(m) \u2208 M \u2297W (k) Q\u0303j /pn Q\u0303j ,\n\u2202ti (j)\n\nis an element of Lie(G) \u2297W (k) Q\u0303j /pn Q\u0303j .\n\u2207\nWe say MQ\u0303j /pn MQ\u0303j potentially is an object of MF[0,1]\n(Q\u0303j ) if there is precisely one\nconnection \u2207 on it; about this connection \u2207 we say it makes (or allows) MQ\u0303j /pn MQ\u0303j\n\u2207\npotentially to be an object of MF[0,1]\n(Q\u0303j ).\n\nWe use the same language for the case of p-divisible objects, i.e. when n = \u221e.\nWarning: in such a case\n\u2227\n\u2207 : M \u2297W (k) Q\u0303\u2227\nj \u2192 M \u2297W (k) \u03a9Q\u0303j /W (k) ,\n\nand we also say that \u03a6(Q\u0303j )0 is \u2207-parallel.\nIf in any of the above cases the connection \u2207 is integrable, then we drop the word\npotentially.

So Zk = Spec(k).\n4) For an arbitrary regular, formally smooth W (k)-algebra R3 as in the end of\n3.6.1.1, and for any (p-divisible) object of MF[\u00e3,b\u0303] (R3 ), with \u00e3, b\u0303 \u2208 Z, \u00e3 \u2264 b\u0303, we use\nthe same language as in 2) but always working with connections satisfying the Griffiths\ntransversality condition. The equations needed to be satisfied are similar to the ones of\n(E1 ) and (E2 ) of 2) (for instance, see [Fa1, p. 33]). Warning: in such a generality, the\nword potentially is not for the time being (cf. 3.6.18.5.5 below).\nAs a quick exemplification, we refer to the context of C of 2.2.1 c), with M a projective\nR -module.

All connections on some object of some Fontaine category of objects not\ninvolving connections, are nilpotent mod p, regardless of the fact that they are or are not\nintegrable.\n3.6.1.1.3. The convenience assumption. Sometimes it is convenient to make the\nassumption that the closed subscheme of Spec(Rj0 /pRj0 ) defined by ti (j) = 0, i running\nthrough the elements of an arbitrary subset of S(1, d), is connected (so in particular, Zk\nis the closed subscheme of Uj0 k defined by ti (j) = 0, \u2200i \u2208 S(1, d)).\nThis can always be achieved by removing a closed subscheme of Uj0 which is not Uj0\nitself. This should be done before the choice of h so that we do not lose track of the\nmorphisms a0 and a2 . It can be done as follows: we choose an open, affine subscheme\nU = Spec(RU ) through which the origin of G factors and an \u00e9tale morphism bU : U \u2192 Y ,\nsuch that the closed subscheme Spec(RU /(p, (zi )i\u2208Id )) of U, with Id an arbitrary subset\nof S(1, d), is connected and the logical W (k)-morphism Spec(RU /((zi )i\u2208I )) \u2192 G is the\norigin. We can take now U0 = U and U2 = g2 U; as the morphisms b0 and b2 we take bU\nand respectively the composite of the left translation by g2\u22121 isomorphism U2 \u2192U\n \u0303 0 with\nbU .\nWarning: unless specifically stated we do not work under above assumption.\n3.6.1.2.

For any perfect field k1 containing\nk, we get similarly (cf. 3)) a reduced, closed subscheme Bj (k1 ) of Gk1 having similar\nproperties as Bj (k); in fact we can take Bj (k1 ) := Bj (k)k1 .\n6) Spec(Qj /pQj ) is an AG k-scheme.\nThe proofs of 3.6.1.2-3 are presented in 3.6.8, after we include some remarks (see\n3.6.1.4-6), some direct applications (see 3.6.2-5), and some extra applications (see 3.6.7)\nwhich rely on some independent results of 3.6.6.\n3.6.1.4. Remarks. 1) Based on 3.6.18.4.2 below, it can be checked that in many\nsituations we can take Qj,n = Rj (so d(n) = 0), \u2200n \u2208 N. All these situations will be\nlisted in \u00a77, after we present (in \u00a77) the classification of Shimura group pairs over Zp ,\nand introduce (see 3.10) some extra terminology. See also 3.11.4 below.\n\u2227\n2) The W (k)-morphism lj,n is an \u00e9tale cover iff Q\u2227\nj,n = Rj (cf. i) of 3.6.1.3 1)). A\nsimple example when lj,1 is not an \u00e9tale cover was suggested by A. Ogus.\nWe take dM = 2 and G = GL(M ). We assume (M, F 1 , h\u03c60 ) is the filtered \u03c3crystal of the canonical lift of an ordinary elliptic curve over k. We also assume the\nexistence of a W (k)-basis {x, y} of M such that h\u03c60 takes x and y respectively into x\nand py. We choose a Frobenius lift of G\u2227 such that under the canonical identification\n1\n]) defined by the above ordered basis of\nG = Spec(W (k)[x11 , x12 , x21 , x22 ][ x11 x22 \u2212x\n21 x12\np\np\nM , x12 goes to x12 , x21 goes to x21 , while xii \u2212 1 goes to (xii \u2212 1)p , i = 1, 2. We can take\nU0 = U2 = G.\nTo see that lj,1 is not an \u00e9tale cover, it is enough to see that any natural pull back of\nMRj /pMRj to a pro-\u00e9tale cover of G\u2227\na , with Ga viewed as the subgroup of G acting trivially on x and on the quotient module M/W (k)x, has no connection on it. This is easy: we\ncan assume k = k\u0304; identifying Ga = Spec(W (k)[t]), with t := x12 , the unique connection\nwe get on M \u2297W (k) W (k)[[t]] making the pull back of MRj through the natural W (k)\u2207\nmorphism Spec(W (k)[[t]]) \u2192 G to be a p-divisible object of MF[0,1]\n(Spec(W (k)[[t]])),\nannihilates x and takes y into \u03b1(t)xdt, where\n\u03b1(t) = \u2212\n\n\u221e\nX\n\ni\n\ntp\n\n\u22121\n\n.\n\ni=0\n\nThe same holds mod p. But \u03b1(t) mod p satisfies the equation (in u)\ntp\u22121 up = u + 1.\nThis equation defines an \u00e9tale scheme over Ga k = Spec(k[t]) which is not an \u00e9tale cover:\nit is obtained from the \u00e9tale cover Spec(k[t, v]/(v p \u2212 v \u2212 t)) of Ga k by removing its closed\nsubscheme (is a disjoint union of p \u2212 1 copies of Spec(k)) defined by t = 0, v 6= 0.\n217\n\n\fIn this example, coming back to the general notations, the k-morphism\nl\u2032j : l\u22121\nj (Spec(Rj /pRj [ Qd\n\n1\n\ni=1 ti (j)\n\n]) \u2192 Spec(Rj /pRj [ Qd\n\n1\n\ni=1 ti (j)\n\n]) := Wj\n\nis an N-pro-\u00e9tale k-morphism of infinite degree. Here d = 4, ti (j) = xii \u2212 1 and ti+2 (j) =\nxi,3\u2212i , with i \u2208 {1, 2}. It defines an N-pro-\u00e9tale cover above the open subscheme of Wj\ndefined by t1 (j) 6= \u22121, as it can be easily checked starting from 3.6.18.4 B) below.\n3) The estimate d(n) \u2264 d2 is not the best possible. For instance if G = GL(M ) it\n2\ncan be checked (this is explained in 3.11.4 below) that we can replace d2 by d4 . For better\nestimates of the real numbers d(n), see 3.11.4. For the time being, we just remark that\nthe bound d2 is independent on n. We do not know (if or) when d(n) = d(1), \u2200n \u2208 N.\n4) We do not know if (or when) the k-morphism defined by the special fibre of lj\nis surjective. Similarly about the k-morphisms defined by the special fibres of lj,n and\nlnj , n \u2208 N, j \u2208 {0, 2}. 3.6.18.5.2 below implicitly motivates why it is natural to expect\n(under some conditions) such k-morphisms to be surjective.\nn\n5) MQj,m /pn MQj,m and (MQj,m /pn MQj,m , \u2207m\nj mod p ), m, n \u2208 N, n \u2264 m, are\nrigid objects in the sense that they have few endomorphisms. For instance, their endomorphisms (called G-endomorphisms) which as elements of End(M/pn M ) \u2297Wn (k)\nQj,m /pn Qj,m belong to g/pn g \u2297Wn (k) Qj,m /pn Qj,m , are often such that these elements\nare the reduction mod pn of those elements of the Lie algebra of the maximal subtorus of\nZ(G) which are fixed by h\u03c60 . This remains true in many cases for the set of all endomorphisms, the group Z(G) being replaced by the centralizer of G in GL(M ). This important\nphenomenon is elaborated in \u00a77, being an essential tool in the strategy of proving part\nof the split criterion of 1.15.4. There are variants of it when we pass to \u00e9tale, affine\nSpec(Qj,m )-schemes. In these variants extra endomorphisms can show up: like the ones\nad\nspringing from direct factors of Lie(Gad\nW (k1 ) ) contained in W (0)(Lie(GW (k1 ) ), h\u03c60 \u2297 1);\nhere k1 is a finite field extension of k.\n6) iii) and 3.6.1.3 UP can be formulated for arbitrary formally \u00e9tale Rj\u2227 -schemes,\nnot necessarily affine (cf. also 3.6.18.4.2 below).\n3.6.1.5. \u03c3-S-crystals. Let \u00e3, b\u0303 \u2208 Z, with \u00e3 \u2264 b\u0303. Let (M\u0303 , (F i (M\u0303 ))i\u2208S(\u00e3+1,b\u0303) , \u03c6\u0303) be\na p-divisible object of MF[\u00e3,b\u0303] (W (k)). Let G\u0303 be a smooth, closed subgroup of GL(M\u0303 )\nhaving connected fibres and such that:\n\u2013 Lie(G\u0303)[ p1 ] is stable under the action of \u03c6\u0303;\n\u2013 Lie(G\u0303) together with the induced filtration (from the natural induced filtration of\nEnd(M\u0303 ); see 2.1) and Frobenius endomorphism \u03c6\u0303 of Lie(G\u0303)[ p1 ], is a p-divisible subobject\nof the p-divisible object (End(M\u0303 ), (F i (M\u0303 ))i\u2208SS(\u00e3,b\u0303) , \u03c6\u0303) of MF (W (k)) (adding the Lie\nstructure it is an [\u00e3 \u2212 b\u0303, b\u0303 \u2212 \u00e3]-filtered Lie \u03c3-crystal in the sense of 2.2.3 2)).\nThe quadruple\n(M\u0303 , (F i (M\u0303 ))i\u2208S(\u00e3+1,b\u0303) , \u03c6\u0303, G\u0303)\n218\n\n\fis called a filtered \u03c3-S-crystal (over k); here S stands for subobject and refers to the\nsecond of the above two conditions. As in 2.2.8 2) or 4) we get \u03c3-S-crystals. As examples\nwe mention the pseudo Shimura \u03c3-crystals (cf. 2.2.9 1')) and the p-divisible objects with\na reductive structure over k (cf. 2.2.8 4a)). We would like to point out that we did not\nassume the existence of a cocharacter \u03bc : Gm \u2192 G\u0303, normalizing F i (M\u0303 ), \u2200i \u2208 S(\u00e3, b\u0303),\nwith \u03b2 \u2208 Gm (W (k)) acting through it on F i (M\u0303 )/F i+1 (M\u0303 ) as the multiplication with \u03b2 \u2212i\n(to be compared with 2.2.8 3), where this is a consequence of the hypothesis involved).\nWhen such a cocharacter does exist, we speak about (filtered) \u03c3-S-crystals for which the\nW -condition holds (the letter W stands to honor [Wi]). It is easy to see that the Facts of\n2.2.9 1) and 1') apply to the present context of (filtered) \u03c3-S-crystals (in connection to\n2.2.9 1') for p \u2264 1 + b\u0303 \u2212 \u00e3 we need to assume that a corresponding Galois representation\ndoes exist); keeping in mind what S stands for, we felt it is appropriate not to use the\nword \"pseudo\" in front of the above terminology if the W -condition does not hold.\nOne could allow the fibres of G\u0303 not to be connected; but this can create problems.\nFirst, the Lie algebra of a smooth group H\u0303 over W (k) is determined by its connected\ncomponent of the origin. Second, if the special fibre is not connected, then we can get into\ntrouble with problems involving Newton polygons, as for such problems it is important\nonly how the p-adic completion of H\u0303 looks like. On the other hand: in [Fa2, rm. ii) after\nth. 10] the group involved does not necessarily have a connected special fibre.\n3.6.1.6. Remark. It is expected that everything in 3.6.1.3 (when properly formulated; see the paragraphs below) remains true in the context of \u03c3-S-crystals.\nThis is true for (\u00e3, b\u0303) = (0, 1) as well as for the context of generalized Shimura pdivisible objects of MF (W (k)). The proof in the case when (\u00e3, b\u0303) = (0, 1) is entirely the\nsame (cf. also 3.6.8.4 1) and 3) below).\nIn the other case we have to interpret 3.6.1.3 as a property of Shimura filtered Lie \u03c3crystals. For instance, in many cases, we can construct a Shimura filtered \u03c3-crystal whose\nShimura adjoint filtered Lie \u03c3-crystal is isomorphic to the one of our Shimura p-divisible\nobject of MF (W (k)); for details see 4.6.7. The general case for this interpretation is\nexplained in 3.6.18.7.3 C and 3.15.6. There is a second approach to this interpretation:\nthe duality aspects of 2.2.23 B are the very root of it. In other words, the philosophy (to\nbe elaborated in \u00a77) is:\nPh. A great part of this 3.6 pertaining to p-divisible objects (or just objects) of\nsome category MF[0,1](\u2217) can be extended to symmetric or alternating objects and to pdivisible objects which have symmetric or alternating quasi-polarizations, of some category\nMF[\u22121,1] (\u2217).\nIn the above two cases we can introduce as in 2.2.10 and 2.2.10.1 the notion of\nfiltered F -S-crystal and respectively of generalized Shimura (filtered) F -crystal or pdivisible object of some category MF[\u00e3,b\u0303] (\u2217); here \u2217 stands for regular, formally smooth\nW (k)-algebras or (when possible) (p-adic formal) W (k)-schemes.\nWhat we meant above by \"properly formulated\": following the discussion of 3.6.8.9\nbelow, we might have to work with a different Frobenius endomorphism of the module\n219\n\n\funderlying the p-divisible objects involved (i.e. we do not use a natural equivalent ej \u2208\nG\u0303(\u2217\u2227 ) of rj of 3.6.1 but some other element \u1ebdj \u2208 G\u0303(\u2217\u2227 ), very carefully chosen; warning:\nwe do have in mind the requirement that \u1ebdj mod p is ej mod p).\n3.6.2. First consequences. We now look at some immediate implications of\n3.6.1.2-3. It is known (see 2.2.1.1 2); here \u2013as well as in all subsequent places relying\n\u2207\non it\u2013 is the second place where we need p \u2265 3) that the category MF[0,1]\n(Qj,n ) is\n\u22121\n\u2227\nantiequivalent (via the D functor) to p \u2212 F F (Spec(Qj,n )), j \u2208 {0, 2}. So corresponding\nto MQj,n /pn MQj,n and \u2207nj , we get a finite, flat, commutative group scheme\nDj,n\nndM\nover Spec(Q\u2227\n. Due to the uniqueness of \u2207nj , (lnj )\u2217 (Dj,n ) can be naturally\nj,n ) of rank p\nidentified with Dj,n+1 [pn ], \u2200n \u2208 N, j \u2208 {0, 2}. So the objects MQj /pn MQj together with\nthe connection on M \u2297W (k) Qj /pn Qj obtained from \u2207j,n by extension of scalars, n \u2208 N,\nwhen put together (i.e. when we consider the limit of the N-projective system they define\nnaturally) \"give birth\" under the mentioned antiequivalence to a p-divisible group Dj\nover Spec(Qj ): we have Dj [pn ] = Dj,n Spec(Qj ) . Let \u2207j be the connection on M \u2297W (k) Qj\n\u2207\nwhich makes MQj to be a p-divisible object of MF[0,1]\n(Qj ). As the connections \u2207nj ,\nn \u2208 N, respect the G-action, \u2207j respects as well the G-action; so \u2207j (t\u03b1 ) = 0, \u2200 \u2208 J . We\nconclude:\n\nCorollary. The pair\nD(j) := (Dj , (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J )\nis a Shimura p-divisible group over Qj .\n3.6.2.0. A fact. Let l\u0303j be as in 3.6.1.3 4). From the UP of 3.6.1.3 4) we get:\n \u0303 j ) = D((l\u0303\u221e )\u2217 (Dj )).\n(MQ\u0303j , \u2207\nj\n3.6.2.1. Some properties. For simplifying the notations we assume now, till the\nend of 3.6.5, that k = k\u0304. We also assume h\u22121 (resp. g2 h\u22121 ) mod p does not define a\npoint of B0 (k) (resp. of B2 (k)). So we have the following properties (the first three, i.e.\na) to c), are a consequence of the shape of the Frobenius lift \u03a6Rj of Rj\u2227 of 3.6.0).\na) a\u2217j (D(j)) is the Shimura p-divisible group (D\u22121 (M, F 1 , h\u03c60 ), (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J )), j \u2208 {0, 2}.\nb) The pull back of D(0) through any W (k)-morphism Spec(W (k)) \u2192 Spec(Q0 )\nwhich composed with l0 is the W (k)-morphism Spec(W (k)) \u2192 U00 defining h\u22121 , is the\nShimura p-divisible group (D\u22121 (M, F 1 , \u03c60 ), (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J )).\nc) The pull back of D(2) through any W (k)-morphism Spec(W (k)) \u2192 Spec(Q2 )\nwhich composed with l2 is the W (k)-morphism Spec(W (k)) \u2192 U20 defining g2 h\u22121 , is the\nShimura p-divisible group (D\u22121 (M, F 1 , g2 \u03c60 ), (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J )).\nd) We denote by\nO0 := W (k)[[w1 , . . . , wd ]]\n220\n\n\fthe W (k)-algebra of the completion of G (or of U00 or U20 ) in a0 . It is the same as the\nW (k)-algebra of the completion of Spec(Qj ) in aj , j \u2208 {0, 2}; so we have O0 = R\u030200 = R\u030220 .\nThe pull backs of D(0) and D(2) to Spec(O0 ) are denoted by D00 and respectively by D20 .\n\u2207\nThe p-divisible objects with tensors of MF[0,1]\n(O0 ) they define are both Shimura filtered\nF -crystals: (M, F 1 , h\u03c60 , G, f \u03030 , (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ) and respectively (M, F 1 , h\u03c60 , G, f \u03032 , (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ).\nWarning: the Frobenius lift of O0 corresponding to D00 (i.e. defined by f \u03030 ) is different from the Frobenius lift of O0 corresponding to D20 (i.e. defined by f \u03032 ).\nBut these two Shimura filtered F -crystals are induced one from each other, cf. [Fa2,\ni) and iii) after th. 10] (the mentioned two Frobenius lifts of O0 are as needed for\napplying loc. cit., cf. the way we defined \u03a6Rj in 3.6.0). This means that there are\nW (k)-homomorphisms\nO0\n\n\u03c90\n\u21d2\n\u03c92\n\nO0\n\nsuch that the Shimura filtered F -crystal with tensors associated to the pull back of Dj0\nthrough the morphism of schemes associated to \u03c9j , is 1J -isomorphic (in the same sense as\nin 2.2.9 6)) to (M, F 1 , h\u03c60 , G, f \u03032\u2212j , (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ), under an isomorphism lifting the identity\nautomorphism of the Shimura p-divisible group of a), \u2200j \u2208 {0, 2}.\n3.6.2.2. Terminology. We call this last fact, that D00 and D20 are induced one\nfrom each other, the very weak gluing principle. It is trivial to check, using 2.2.21, that\nwe can actually choose \u03c9j , j \u2208 {0, 2}, to be isomorphisms of W (k)-algebras, and we call\nthis fact the weak gluing principle.\n3.6.3. Pull backs to Witt rings. We consider (cf. 3.6.2) the following Lie\n\u2207\np-divisible object of MF[\u22121,1]\n(Qj ):\nEnd(MQj ) := End(M ) \u2297 Qj , rj \u25e6 lj (h\u03c60 \u2297 1), F 0 (End(M )) \u2297 Qj , F 1 (End(M )) \u2297 Qj , \u2207j\n\n\u0001\n\n(all tensors products are over W (k)). Here, as in 2.2.10, we still denote by \u2207j the natural\nconnection on End(M ) \u2297W (k) Qj .\nSimilarly, we define gQj by working with g instead of End(M ). For any n \u2208 N,\n\u2207\nEnd(MQj /pn Qj ) := End(MQj )/pn End(MQj ) is a Lie object of MF[\u22121,1]\n(Qj ), having\nn\n(as \u2207j respects the G-action and rj lj \u2208 G(Qj )) gQj /p gQj as a Lie subobject, j \u2208 {0, 2}.\nAs in Fact 3 of 2.2.10 (see also the general principle of 2.2.20 5)), we get:\nFact. For any W (k)-morphism z : Spec(W (k 1 )) \u2192 Spec(Qj ), with k 1 a perfect\nfield containing k, the pull back of (MQj , \u2207j , (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ) through z is a Shimura filtered\n\u03c3k1 -crystal with an emphasized family of tensors\n\u0001\nM \u2297W (k) W (k 1 ), F 1 \u2297W (k) W (k 1 ), \u03c61j , GW (k1 ) , (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ,\nwhere \u03c61j = gj1 \u03c60 for some element gj1 \u2208 G(W (k 1 )).\n\nSo we can speak about the Shimura filtered Lie \u03c3k1 -crystal attached to it: its underlying W (k 1 )-module is Lie(GW (k1 ) ) = g \u2297W (k) W (k 1 ) \u2282 End(M \u2297W (k) W (k 1 )).\n221\n\n\f3.6.4. Generic pull backs. Considering an arbitrary point z j : Spec(W (kj )) \u2192\nSpec(Qj ), with kj a perfect field containing k, such that the induced point Spec(kj ) \u2192\nSpec(Qj /pQj ) sits over the generic point of Spec(Qj /pQj ), we get (cf. 3.6.3) a Shimura\nfiltered \u03c3kj -crystal\n\u0001\nCj := M \u2297W (k) W (kj ), F 1 \u2297W (k) W (kj ), \u03c6j , GW (kj ) ,\nwith \u03c6j = g j \u03c60 for some element g j \u2208 G(W (kj )). The Shimura filtered Lie \u03c3kj -crystal\nLie(Cj ) := g \u2297W (k) W (kj ), \u03c6j , F 0 (g) \u2297W (k) W (kj ), F 1 (g) \u2297W (k) W (kj )\n\n\u0001\n\nhas a Newton polygon which does not depend on j \u2208 {0, 2} (cf. 3.6.2 d)) and is below\nthe Newton polygon of (g, \u03c60 ) (as C0 specializes to (M, F 1 , \u03c60 ), cf. 3.6.2 b)). Moreover\nC2 specializes to (M, F 1 , g2 \u03c60 ) and so Lie(C2 ) specializes to (g, g2 \u03c60 ) (cf. 3.6.2 c)).\n3.6.5. Remarks. 1) We could have worked to achieve the connection of the\nShimura \u03c3-crystal (M, g2 \u03c60 , G) to a Shimura \u03c3-crystal expected to be G-ordinary working with just one deformation, cf. 3.6.7 below. We preferred to work with two global\ndeformations (over Q0 and Q2 ) as we hope that this method will be useful in other contexts: we have in mind applications to the construction of integral models of Shimura\nvarieties of special type by using moduli schemes of p-divisible groups when possible and\nwhen not of generalized Shimura p-divisible objects, as well as applications to p-adic\nuniformizations of Shimura varieties, cf. also 3.6.19 below.\n2) Theoretically it can happen that h\u22121 mod p belongs to B0 (k) or that g2 h\u22121 mod\np belongs to B2 (k) (cf. the constructions of 3.6.8.2 below). Then we can not go ahead\nwith 3.6.2-4. So we have to proceed more carefully, cf. 3.6.7 below.\n3) We denote the p-divisible group Dj as well as the Shimura p-divisible group D(j)\nover Spec(Qj ) introduced in 3.6.2 by\nD(Uj0 , \u03a6Rj , M, F 1 , h\u03c60 , G),\nin order to emphasize the data needed to construct them.\n3.6.6. Lemma. We consider the set L of k-valued points of G obtained from the\nset DG of 3.2.10 by reduction mod p. We have: it is dense in Gk .\nProof: Let H be the Zariski closure of L in Gk . Writing g = p1 n1 , with p1 normalizing F 1 and with n1 \u2208 Ker(G(W (k)) \u2192 G(k)), we get that L is the image at the level\nof k-valued points of a k-morphism\nmH : H\u0303 \u2192 H\nof varieties: we take H\u0303 := P0 k \u00d7k Pk \u00d7 Uk , with Pk as the parabolic subgroup of Gk\nnormalizing F 1 /pF 1 and with Uk as the affine k-variety defined naturally by the k-vector\nspace underlying g/pg + F 0 (g); the morphism mH is easily describable starting from\n222\n\n\f3.2.10 (FORM) by working mod p. As H\u0303(k) is Zariski dense in H\u0303 (see [Bo2, 18.3]) we\nget that mH is a dominant k-morphism.\nFor a Galois extension k1 of k, we denote by L1 \u2282 G(k1 ) and H1 \u0592\u2192 Gk1 the analogues\nof L and H obtained by working over W (k1 ) instead of W (k). L1 is stable under the\nnatural action of the Galois group Gal(k1 /k) on G(k1 ) and moreover L is a subset of\nthe subset of L1 formed by elements fixed by it. In fact the similarly constructed k1 morphism mH1 is nothing else but the extension of mH to k1 (see the end of the previous\nparagraph). So if H1 = Gk1 then H = Gk . So we can assume k = k\u0304 (in fact for most\nof below arguments it is enough to assume G is split). This allows us to replace (in the\ndefinition of L and H) \u03c60 by \u03c61 (cf. 3.2.3, 3.3.1-2 and the translation part of 3.3.3).\nWe use the notations of 3.4.0-3. H is Z(Gk )-invariant and Z(Gk ) \u2282 H. It is enough\nto work with a subset I0 of I corresponding to a cycle \u03b30 of \u03b3; we just need to show that\nH contains the subgroup of G generated by Gi , i \u2208 I0 .\nFor i \u2208 I0 , let Ni+ be the integral, connected, smooth, unipotent, abelian subgroup\nof Gi having F 1 (gi ) as its Lie algebra and let Ni\u2212 be the integral, connected, smooth,\nunipotent, abelian subgroup of Gi which is the opposite of Ni+ w.r.t. the action of Ti\n(via inner conjugation) on Gi . So we have\nLie(Ni\u2212 ) =\n\nM\n\ng\u0303i (\u2212\u03b1).\n\n\u03b1\u2208\u03a6+\ni\n\ng\u0303i (\u03b1)\u2282Lie(Ni+ )\n\nWe consider the following two cases:\n1) I \u03030 = 1, and\n2) I \u03030 \u2265 2.\nWe first treat the case 1). So I \u03030 = I1 = I0 = {1} = {i}. Let exp be the exponential map which takes x \u2208 pLie(Ni\u2212 ) into the W (k)-valued point of G defined by the\nautomorphism 1M + x of M . Let P0 (i) := Gi \u2229 P0 . Working with an arbitrary element\np0 \u2208 P0 (i)(W (k)) and with\n\u0001\ng \u2208 exp pLie(Ni\u2212 ) ,\n\nwe deduce (as \u03c61 (pLie(Ni\u2212 )) = Lie(Ni\u2212 ), cf. 3.4.3.2 and the fact that I \u03030 has only 1\nelement) that H contains the product of P0 (i)k and of Ni\u2212 k ; from [Bo2, 14.14] we get\nthat H contains Gi k .\nThe case 2) is very much the same. For i \u2208 I \u03030 , we define Gi := Gi\u2032 , where i\u2032 \u2208 I0 is\nsuch that n = |I0 | divides i \u2212 i\u2032 ; similarly we use the same approach mod n for different\n+\nother groups or Lie algebras or sets of roots indexed by i \u2208 I \u03030 (so \u03a6+\ni = \u03a6i\u2032 , etc.).\nWarning: sometimes, in what follows we specifically state that i \u2208 I0 , i.e. sometimes the\ncorrect set of indices is I0 and not I \u03030 ; when this is not stated explicitly, then i \u2208 I \u03030 .\n223\n\n\fLet\nMi :=\n\nX\n\nGa,\u03b1(i) .\n\n\u03b1\u2208\u03a6\u2212\ni\ng\u0303i (\u03b1)6\u2282Lie(Ni\u2212 )\u2295Lie(P0 (i))\n\nHere Ga,\u03b1(i) is the GP\na subgroup of Gi having g\u0303i (\u03b1) as its Lie algebra, P0 (i) := Gi \u2229 P0 ,\nwhile the sum sign\nrefers to the fact that we take the subgroup of Gi generated by\nthese Ga subgroups. Mi is a connected, unipotent, smooth subgroup of Gi .\nQ\nWe choose g = i\u2208I \u03030 gi , with gi \u2208 Gi (W (k)) of the form gi = vi wi , where\nvi \u2208 exp pLie(Ni\u2212 )\n\nand\n\n\u0001\n\nwi \u2208 Mi (W (k)),\n\u2200i \u2208 I \u03030 . We also choose\np0 =\n\nY\n\npi0 ,\n\ni\u2208I \u03030\n\nwith pi0 \u2208 P0 (i)(W (k)). For g\u0303 \u2208 G(W (k)) normalizing F 1 /pF 1 , we denote\n\u03c61 (g\u0303) := \u03c61 g\u0303\u03c6\u22121\n1 \u2208 G(W (k)).\nWe have e \u2208 {1, 2}, cf. 3.4.3.1 and the beginning paragraph of 3.4. To study h\u0303 defined\nby the equality h\u0303\u03c61 = gp0 \u03c61 g \u22121 , we consider two subcases.\nWe first assume |I0 | = 1; so I \u03030 = 2. We consider the Zp -structure GZ of G\np\n\n1\n\nconstructed as in 2.2.9 8) starting from (M, F , \u03c61 , G). Using it, it makes sense to speak\nabout \u03c3 acting on W (k)-valued or k-valued points of G. We take v2 , w2 and p20 to be\n1M . We get h\u0303 = v1 w1 p10 \u03c61 (w1\u22121 )\u03c61 (v1\u22121 ). So h\u0303 mod p is\nw\u03041 p\u030410 \u03c3(w\u03041\u22121 )s\u03041 ,\nwhere w\u03041 , p\u030410 and s\u03041 are the reduction mod p of respectively w1 , p10 and \u03c6(v1\u22121 ). The role\nof s\u03041 is that of an arbitrary element of \u03c3(N1\u2212 )(k).\nWe write s\u03041 = m\u03041 s\u030411 , with m\u03041 \u2208 M1 (k) \u2282 \u03c3(N1\u2212 )(k) and with s\u030411 \u2208 \u03c3(N1\u2212 )(k).\nWe have \u03c3(w\u03041\u22121 )m\u03041 = m\u03041 \u03c3(w\u03041\u22121 )s\u030311 , with s\u030311 \u2208 N1\u2212 \u2229 \u03c3(N1\u2212 )(k); this is an immediate\nconsequence of the formula of [BT, 4.2 (1)]. Using [SGA3, Vol. III, 4.1.2 of p. 172], we\ncan write\np\u030410 m\u03041 = m\u030411 p\u03041,1\n0 ,\nwith m\u030411 \u2208 M1 (k) and with p\u03041,1\n\u2208 P0 (1)(k), provided we choose p\u030410 to be a k-valued\n0\npoint of a small enough open subscheme of P0 (1)k containing its origin. We can always\nchoose m\u03041 such that w\u03041 m\u030411 is the identity element. Denoting s\u0304111 := s\u030311 s\u030411 , we get that\nh\u0303 mod p can be written as\n\u22121\np\u03041,1\n0 \u03c3(w\u03041 )s\u0304111 .\n224\n\n\f\u22121\np\u030411\n0 , \u03c3(w\u03041 ) and s\u0304111 are running independently through the k-valued points of an open\nsubscheme of P\u03040 (i)k containing the origin, of \u03c3(M1 )k and respectively of \u03c3(N1\u2212 )k . So,\nfrom [Bo2, 14.14] we get that L contains the k-valued points of an open, dense subscheme\nof \u1e201 ; so H contains \u1e201 .\nFrom now on we assume |I0 | \u2265 2.

Moreover, \u00d1i0 is the semidirect product of \u00d1i2 and of \u00d1i1 . The role of\n\u22121\n) is that of an arbitrary element of \u00d1i0 (W (k)).

Loc. cit.\ncan be applied as the product P0 (i)\u00d1i1 is an open subscheme of the parabolic subgroup\nof Gi generated by P0 (i) and \u00d1i1 . Fixing some i \u2208 I \u03030 , n\u03041i , p\u0303i0 , \u00f12i and \u00f1i are allowed to\n225\n\n\frun independently through open, dense subschemes through which the origin of G factors\nof subgroups of Gi of whose Lie algebras are forming a direct sum decomposition of gi ;\nwe refer to this property as IND.\nWe write wi = w\u0303i2 w\u0303i1 , with w\u0303i1 \u2208 \u00d1i1 (W (k)) and with w\u0303i2 a W (k)-valued point\nof the connected, smooth subgroup of Mi of whose Lie algebra is the direct summand\nof Lie(\u00d1i1 ) in Lie(Mi ) normalized by T .

Warning: such components are always written down on the right side of products\nof two elements. Redenoting p\u0303i := p\u03030i , we get\nhi = vi w\u0303i2 w\u0303i1 n\u03041i p\u0303i \u00f12i \u00f1i .\nKey point. The 1 dimensional B(k)-vector spaces g\u0303i (\u03b1)[ p1 ], i \u2208 I0 , which are not\nincluded in Lie(P1 )[ p1 ] = Lie(P0 )[ p1 ] (see 3.3.2 for this identification), are permuted by \u03c61\nin such a way that in any resulting cycle there is such a B(k)-vector space contained in\nLie(Ni\u2212 )[ p1 ], for some i \u2208 I1 .\nThe key point is a consequence of 3.4.3.0 (1) and of the signs of si (\u03b1)'s as explained\nin 3.4.3.0 (based on the end of 3.2.3). So we have:\nClaim. \u2200i \u2208 I \u03030 , h\u0303i mod p runs independently through the k-valued points of an open,\ndense subscheme of Gi ad\nk .\nTo prove the Claim, we fix arbitrarily some i \u2208 I \u03030 ; for simplifying the presentation,\nwe assume it is the biggest element of I \u03030 . As vi is congruent to the identity mod p, h\u0303i\ncan be defined as well as the image of vi\u22121 hi in Gad\ni (k). We choose wi to be an arbitrary\npoint of an open, dense subscheme of Mi containing the origin and small enough. We\nnow choose gi\u22121 and pi0 (i.e. we choose n\u03041i , p\u0303i0 , \u00f12i and \u00f1i , cf. IND) such that vi\u22121 hi is\nan arbitrary element of an open, dense subscheme of Gi containing the origin. So the\nClaim holds for h\u0303i mod p. We can choose gi\u22121 (more precisely n\u03041i ) to depend only on the\ncomponent w\u03031 of wi . Next, we choose inductively on s \u2208 S(2, I \u03030 \u22121}) elements gi\u2212s and\ni\n\n\u22121\nsuch that vi+1\u2212s\nhi+1\u2212s is an arbitrary element of an open, dense subscheme of\nGi+1\u2212s through which the origin factors. Moreover, we can assume gi\u22122 depends only on\nthe component w\u0303i12 \u2208 \u00d1i12 (W (k)) of w\u0303i1 , where \u00d1i12 is the connected, smooth subgroup\n1\nof \u00d1i1 whose Lie algebra is \u03c61 (Lie(\u00d1i\u22121\n)) \u2229 Lie(\u00d1i1 ), etc. This takes care of the Claim\nexcept for 1. The above key point implies: v1\u22121 h1 is as well an arbitrary element of an\nopen, dense subscheme of G1 containing the origin. In other words, a similar choice of\ngi (i.e. of wi and vi ) and of p10 is possible, which does not depend on the initial choice of\n12...|I \u03030 |\n12...|I \u03030 |\u22121\nwi (i.e. the last component w\u0303i\n\u2013 we define inductively is 1M ). So we\n\u2013of w\u0303i\ncan choose as the \"new\" wi , the initial element wi we started with. So the Claim holds\nas well for 1; this proves the Claim.\n\np1+i\u2212s\n0\n\n226\n\n\fFrom the Claim and (EXPR) we get: ZH (I0 ) is\nthe Lemma.\n\nQ\n\ni\u2208I0\n\nGad\ni k . This ends the proof of\n\n3.6.6.0. Exercise. If g2 \u2208 DG and g3 \u2208 G(W (k)) mod p is the identity element,\nthen (M, g3 g2 \u03c60 ) has \u03c40 as its formal isogeny type and (g, g3 g2 \u03c60 ) has the same Newton\npolygon as (g, \u03c60 ). Hint: use the ideas of the proof of 3.6.6 and of b) of 4.4.1 2) below;\nby induction on m \u2208 N show that we can assume g3 mod pm is the identity element and\nso, choosing m big enough, 3.3.4 and [Ka2, 1.4.4] apply.\nThis Exercise is referred in what follows just to point out some alternatives or possible\nshortcuts in 3.6.6.1 2), 4.6.6 and Appendix, and so it is not used before Appendix. See\n3.6.17 for a solution of it (deviating to some extent from its hint).\n3.6.6.1. Remarks. 1) Another proof of 3.6.6 (and actually of the stronger fact\nthat L \u2283 U1 (k), with U1 an open subscheme of Gk containing its origin; warning: the\nabove proof of 3.6.6 also obtains this stronger fact) can be obtained using 3.4.8, 3.4.11\nand 3.6.10 below.\n2) A fast proof of 3.1.3 a) and b) together with the inclusion AG \u2282 BG can be\nobtained by putting together 3.6.6, 3.3.4, 3.4.11 and 3.6.10 below; also: the use of 3.4.11\ncan be substituted by 3.6.6.0.\n3.6.6.2. Some extensions of 3.6.6. 3.6.6 can be entirely adapted (cf. its proof)\nto the generalized Shimura context. One just needs to show that the case e = 3 can be\ntreated entirely similar. For e = 3, the subcase |I0 | \u2265 2 of the Case 2) of 3.6.6 needs\nno modifications: one just needs to take pn+1\n,..., p02n to be as well identity elements;\n0\nthe subcase |I0 | = 1 and I \u03030 = 3 can be treated entirely similar to the first subcase\nof the Case 2) of 3.6.6. The exponential map as used in 3.6.6, still makes sense in the\ngeneralized Shimura context: it can be used with the same purpose (as we can see mod\np2 ); this is still part of the first place where we need p \u2265 3.\n3.6.7. One global deformation. Section 3.6 started with the desire of connecting\nthe (arbitrary) Shimura filtered \u03c3-crystal (M, F 1 , g2 \u03c60 , G) with the (extension to k\u0304 of\nthe) Shimura filtered \u03c3-crystal (M, F 1 , \u03c60 , G) or with another Shimura filtered \u03c3\u0304-crystal\nwhich is \u2013supposed to be\u2013 a G-ordinary \u03c3\u0304-crystal. This is achieved as follows.\nLet U = Spec(R1 ) be an open, affine subscheme of G, with U(W (k)) containing 1M .\nWe assume there is an \u00e9tale W (k)-morphism bU : U \u2192 Y , with the origin of G factoring\nthrough the closed subscheme of U obtained as the inverse image through bU of the closed\nsubscheme of Y defined by zi = 0, i = 1, d. If needed, we replace U by a suitable open,\naffine subscheme of it, so that the condition ii) of the beginning of 3.6 is satisfied for bU .\nLet \u03a6R1 be the Frobenius lift of U \u2227 obtained through bU from the Frobenius lift of Y\nwhich (at rings' level) takes zi to zip , i = 1, d.\nLet D1 := D(U, \u03a6R1 , M, F 1 , g2 \u03c60 , G) be the p-divisible group over the p-adic completion Spec(Q1 ) of an N-pro-\u00e9tale, affine scheme over U, obtained as in 3.6.1.3, cf. 3.6.5 3).\nSometimes, not to complicate the notation, we also refer to D1 as a Shimura p-divisible\ngroup, the Shimura structure being the natural one. From 3.6.1.3 5) and 3.6.6 we deduce\n(as in 3.6.3-4 and 2.3.16) that:\n227\n\n\f3.6.7.1. Corollary. The Shimura \u03c3k1 -crystal C1 associated to the pull back of D1 to\nthe spectrum of the algebraic closure k1 of the field of fractions of Q1 /pQ1 , specializes to\n(M, g2 \u03c60 , G) and to a Shimura \u03c3\u0304-crystal of the form (M \u2297W (k) W (k\u0304), g3 (\u03c60 \u2297 1), GW (k\u0304) ),\nwith g3 \u2208 G(W (k\u0304)) which mod p belongs to the set L(k\u0304) defined as the set L of 3.6.6 but\nworking over W (k\u0304) instead of over W (k).\n3.6.8. The proofs of 3.6.1.2-3. From many points of view this 3.6.8 is the very\nheart of the whole of 3.6; so, though it uses very concrete situations, the reader should\nalways keep in mind that it captures the very essence of most of what follows after it in\n3.6.9-20. We work with just one index j: 0. We have the following 14 steps, supported\nby the Lemma 3.6.8.2.\n1) The complete local case. We recall \u03a6R\u03020 is induced from \u03a6R0 . There is a\n0\n\nunique connection \u2207R\u03020 on M \u2297W (k) R\u030200 which makes MR\u03020 potentially to be viewed as a\n0\n\n0\n\n\u2207\np-divisible object of MF[0,1]\n(R\u030200 ); it is integrable and nilpotent mod p. For these facts\ncf. [Fa2, th. 10] (and its proof for the uniqueness part): the part of the paragraph before\n3.6.1 involving Frobenius lifts allows us to apply loc. cit.\n\n2) The G-action. \u2207R\u03020 respects the G-action, i.e. it is of the form \u03b40 + \u03b2, with\n0\n\n\u03b2 \u2208 R\u030200 \u2297R0 (g \u2297W (k) \u03a9R0 /W (k) )\n(cf. [Fa2, rm. ii) after th. 10]). Here and in what follows, for any formally \u00e9tale\nR0 -algebra R\u03030 , \u03b40 is the (truncation modulo some positive, integral power of p of the)\nconnection on M \u2297W (k) R\u03030 annihilating M .\n3) The general form of connections. Let S(M ) := S(1, dM ). Let S(G) :=\nS(1, d). We choose a W (k)-basis {ei |i \u2208 S(M )} of M . Let {eis |i, s \u2208 S(M )} be the\ncanonical W (k)-basis of End(M ) w.r.t. this chosen W (k)-basis of M ; so eis (es ) = ei . For\nthe sake of generality, for the time being, we make this choice arbitrarily. Later on we\nspecialize to a proper choice (see 3.6.8.5) suitable for computations. \u03a9R0 /W (k) is a free\nR0 -module having {dtl (0)|l \u2208 S(G)} as a basis.\nLet  \u0303l0 : Spec(Q\u0303\u2227\n0 ) \u2192 Spec(R0 ) be a formally \u00e9tale, affine W (k)-morphism, with Q\u03030\na W (k)-algebra. An arbitrary connection \u2207 on M \u2297W (k) Q\u0303\u2227\n0 can be written in the form\nX\n(0)\n\u2207 = \u03b40 +\nxisl eis \u2297 dtl (0),\n(i,s,l)\u2208S(M )\u00d7S(M )\u00d7S(G)\n\nwith xisl \u2208 Q\u0303\u2227\n0 , \u2200(i, s, l) \u2208 S(M ) \u00d7 S(M ) \u00d7 S(G). Similarly, if n \u2208 N, and if \u2207 is\na connection on M \u2297W (k) Q\u03030 /pn Q\u03030 , then we have the same expression for it but with\nxisl \u2208 Q\u03030 /pn Q\u03030 .\n4) The equations. We start treating the case n = 1. The condition that a\nconnection \u2207 on M \u2297W (k) Q\u03030 /pQ\u03030 makes MQ\u03030 /pMQ\u03030 potentially to be viewed as an\n\u2207\nobject of MF[0,1]\n(Q\u03030 ), is expressed (cf. 3.6.1.1.1 2)) by the following equations\n(1)\n\n\u2207 \u25e6 \u03a6(Q\u03030 )0 (m) = p\u03a6(Q\u03030 )0 \u25e6 d\u03a6Q\u03030 \u2217 /p \u25e6 \u2207(m) = 0,\n228\n\n\fif m \u2208 F 0 \u2297W (k) Q\u03030 /pQ\u03030 , and\n(2)\n\n\u2207 \u25e6 \u03a6(Q\u03030 )1 (m) = \u03a6(Q\u03030 )0 \u25e6 d\u03a6Q\u03030 \u2217 /p \u25e6 \u2207(m),\n\nif m \u2208 F 1 \u2297W (k) Q\u03030 /pQ\u03030 .\n5) A new way of looking at these equations. The above equations are replaced,\nusing the chosen form (0) of \u2207 (with xisl \u2208 Q\u03030 /pQ\u03030 ), by equations involving xisl , (i, s, l) \u2208\nS(M ) \u00d7 S(M ) \u00d7 S(G), and the Frobenius transforms of some lifts of them to Q\u03030 taken\nmod p (i.e. and their p-powers). These equations have coefficients in R0 /pR0 and so\nthey define an affine scheme S 1 of finite type over S 0 := Spec(R0 /pR0 ). S 1 is a moduli\nscheme of connections. Let\nl(0) : S 1 \u2192 S 0\nbe the k-morphism we get.\nThe nice thing is that these equations involving xisl 's take the form\n(3)\n\nxisl = Lisl (xp111 , xp112 , ..., xpdM dM d ) + aisl ,\n\nwhere the form Lisl is homogeneous and linear in each variable and has coefficients in\nR0 /pR0 and where aisl \u2208 R0 /pR0 . We have such an equation for each triple (i, s, l) \u2208\nS(M ) \u00d7 S(M ) \u00d7 S(G). This nice shape (3) of the equations involving xisl 's is obtained\nas follows. Let i \u2208 S(M ). Choosing a W (k)-basis {\u1ebdu1 , ..., \u1ebdudimW (k) (F u ) } of F u , u = 0, 1,\nwe can write\n(DIV )\n\nei =\n\n(k) (F\n1 dimWX\nX\n\nu=0\n\nu\n\n)\n\naq (u)\u03a6(R0 )u (\u1ebduq ),\n\nq=1\n\nwith all aq (u)'s as elements of R0\u2227 (we recall: MR0 is a p-divisible object of MF[0,1] (R0 )).\nSumming up as suggested by (DIV) the equations obtained by plugging \u1ebd0q 's and \u1ebd1q 's in\n(1) and respectively in (2) of 4), we get the mentioned shape for the equations involving\nxisl , (s, l) \u2208 S(M ) \u00d7 S(G), in the left hand side of (3). By doing this for any i \u2208 S(M ),\nwe obtain \"all\" equations in the variables xisl (i.e. any other equation produced by (1)\nand (2) is a linear combination of the ones of (3)).\n6) The uniqueness argument. The existence of another (i.e. different) connection on M \u2297W (k) Q\u03030 /pQ\u03030 making MQ\u03030 /pMQ\u03030 potentially to be viewed as an object of\n\u2207\nMF[0,1]\n(Q\u03030 ) corresponds to a non-trivial solution (with values in Q\u03030 /pQ\u03030 ) of the system\nof equations\n(4)\n\nxisl = Lisl (xp111 , xp112 , ..., xpdM dM d ),\n\n(i, s, l) \u2208 S(M )\u00d7S(M )\u00d7S(G). Let I be the ideal of R0 /pR0 generated by tl (0), l \u2208 S(G).\nThe coefficients of the linear forms Lisl are elements of I p\u22121 . This is so due to the fact\nthat \u03a6R0 (tl (0)) = tl (0)p .\n229\n\n\fTo prove 3.6.1.2 for n = 1, we can assume Q\u03030 is a complete, local ring with the\nmaximal ideal generated by I and residue field k\u0304. By induction on q \u2208 N, we get\nthat any solution of the above system (4) of equations, belongs to I p\u22121+pq Q\u03030 /pQ\u03030 . So\nwe get that any such solution must be the trivial one, given by xisl = 0, \u2200(i, s, l) \u2208\nS(M ) \u00d7 S(M ) \u00d7 S(G). This proves 3.6.1.2, for n = 1.\n7) The \"non-empty\" \u00e9tale part. From the shape of the equations of (3) we get\n\u03a9S 1 /S 0 = {0}. On the other hand, the criterion of formal smoothness is satisfied for l(0).\nArgument: we need to show that for any R0 /pR0 -algebra R(0) and for every ideal I(0)\n0\nof it such that I(0)2 = {0}, any solution (y111\n, ..., yd0M dM d ) of (3) in R(0)/I(0) lifts to\na solution of (3) in R(0); but if (y111 , ..., ydM dM d ) is an arbitrary d2M d-tuple formed by\n0\nelements of R(0) and lifting (y111\n, ..., yd0M dM d ), then\np\np\nL111 (y111\n, ..., ydpM dM d ) + a111 , ..., LdM dM d (y111\n, ..., ydpM dM d ) + adM dM d\n\n\u0001\n\n0\nis a solution of (3) in R(0) lifting (y111\n, ..., yd0M dM d ).\nSo S 1 is \u00e9tale over S 0 . Let S01 be the maximal open closed subscheme of S 1 with\nthe property that any connected component of it has a non-empty intersection with the\nclosed subscheme l(0)\u22121 (Zk ) of S 1 . From 6) we get that l(0)\u22121 (Zk ) is either empty\nor Spec(k). So S01 is a connected, affine k-scheme. There are to ways to see that it is\nnon-empty. For the first way we just need to point out: from 1) we deduce the existence\nof a natural formally \u00e9tale R0 /pR0 -morphism\n\nm00 : Spec(R\u030200 /pR\u030200 ) \u2192 S 1\nfactoring through S01 . For the second way, avoiding the use of 1), see 8) below.\nLifting now S01 to a smooth, affine W (k)-scheme (this is standard), we get a formally\n\u2227\n\u00e9tale, affine W (k)-morphism l0,1 : Spec(Q\u2227\n0,1 ) \u2192 Spec(R0 ), with Q0,1 a smooth W (k)1\nalgebra such that Spec(Q0,1 /pQ0,1 ) = S0 , which lifts the k-morphism S01 \u2192 S 0 defined\nnaturally by the k-morphism l(0) of 5). From its construction and from 6) we deduce\nthat ii) and iii) of 3.6.1.3 1) are satisfied for n = 1 (the fact that the connection \u220710\non M \u2297W (k) Q0,1 /pQ0,1 we get is integrable, nilpotent mod p and respects the G-action\nresults from the existence of m00 , cf. 1)).\nNext we present the second way to see that S01 is non-empty.\n8) The \"non-empty\" \u00e9tale part: a new approach. MR0 is the pull back of\nMS0 through the natural inclusion i00 : U00 \u0592\u2192 W00 respecting the Frobenius lifts. So to\nprove that S01 is non-empty, we can work with MS0 instead of MR0 , i.e. we can assume\nG = GL(M ) and R0 = S0 . So d = d2M . But in this case in 5) we have d2 = d4M equations\nin d2 variables. So the fact that S01 is non-empty is handled by the below Lemma (applied\n\u2013cf. the \u00e9taleness part of 7)\u2013 to the reduction of (3) of 5) modulo I); we return to the\nproofs of 3.6.1.2-3 in 3.6.8.2, after a short intermezzo exploiting it to a greater extend.\n3.6.8.1. Fundamental Lemma. Let m, l \u2208 N and let k1 be a field of characteristic\np > 0. We consider an affine k1 -scheme Y0 defined via a system of m equations in m + s\n230\n\n\fvariables x1 , ..., xm+s, s \u2208 N \u222a {0}, of the form\nl\n\nxi = Li (x1 , ..., xm+s)p + c(i),\n\n(5)\n\ni = 1, m, where Li is a homogeneous polynomial of degree 1 with coefficients in k1 and\nc(i) \u2208 k1 , \u2200i \u2208 S(1, m). Then Y0 is a non-empty, smooth k1 -scheme of pure dimension\ns.\nIf s = 0 then Y0 is \u00e9tale over k1 and the number of elements of the set Y0 (k1 ) is\nfinite and equal to plm1 , with m1 \u2208 S(0, m). Moreover, m1 depends only on the coefficients\nof the homogeneous linear forms Li , i \u2208 S(1, m), and not on the free coefficients c(i),\ni \u2208 S(1, m). We also have: m1 is less or equal to the rank rL of the m \u00d7 m matrix AL\nobtained using the coefficients of Li as its rows, i \u2208 S(1, m).\nProof: It is trivial to check (as in 7)) the criterion of formal smoothness for the\nk1 -morphism Y0 \u2192 Spec(k1 ). As Y0 is of finite type over k1 we deduce Y0 is smooth over\nk1 . \u03a9Y0 /k1 is a free OY0 -sheaf of rank s: dxm+1 ,..., dxm+s is a basis of it; so Y0 is of pure\ndimension s. For the other things we can assume s = 0; so Y0 is \u00e9tale over k1 . For the\npart involving Y0 (k1 ), we can assume k1 is algebraically closed.\nWe use mathematical induction. The case m = 1 is obvious. Let now m \u2265 2. We\nintroduce a new variable x0 , so that the equations become homogeneous:\n(6)\n\nl\n\nl\n\nl\n\nxi xp0 \u22121 = Li (x1 , ..., xm)p + c(i)xp0 .\n\nThese equations are defining a closed subscheme Y of Pm\nk1 . By repeatedly using the\nprojective dimension theorem (cf. [Ha, p. 48]), we get it is non-empty. If it has no\npoint in the hypersurface of Pm\nk1 defined by x0 = 0, then we are done: Y0 = Y and\nml\n|Y0 (k1 )| = p , cf. the intersection theory. If Y has a point with x0 = 0, then we get\nthat the homogeneous polynomials Li of degree 1,Pi = 1, m, are linearly dependent, i.e.\nm\nthere are constants a(i) \u2208 k1 , not all 0, such that i=1 a(i)Li = 0. So also\nm\nX\n\nl\n\nl\n\na(i)p Lpi = 0.\n\ni=1\n\nWe can assume a(m) is different from 0 and so we can assume it is 1.\nSo the initial system of (non-homogeneous) equations is equivalent to the system of\nequations, where we preserve the first m \u2212 1 equations, while we replace the last equation\n(obtained for i = m) by the linear equation\nxm +\n\nm\u22121\nX\n\npl\n\na(i) xi = c(m) +\n\ni=1\n\nm\u22121\nX\n\nl\n\nc(i)a(i)p .\n\ni=1\n\nThis last equation allows us to eliminate xm . We come across a system of m\u22121 equations\nin m \u2212 1 variables of the same type as the original one. Moreover, the coefficients of the\n231\n\n\fnew homogeneous linear forms in the variables x1 , x2 ,..., xm\u22121 depend on Li , i \u2208 S(1, m),\nbut do not depend on c(i), i \u2208 S(1, m). So we can proceed by induction. The last part\nabout the estimate of m1 is obvious: as above, we can eliminate m \u2212 rL variables at once.\nThis proves the Lemma.\n3.6.8.1.0. More on m1 . m1 can be smaller than rL . In fact easy examples show\nthat, if rL < m, then m1 can take any value of the set S(0, rL ). Here, we just mention\none example to illustrate this phenomenon. We take m = 2 and we consider the system\nl\nl\nl\nl\ndefined by the following two equations x1 = xp1 \u2212 xp2 and x2 = xp1 \u2212 xp2 . So rL = 1. But\nm1 = 0 as the only solution of this system of equations is the pair (x1 , x2 ) = (0, 0).\nOn the other hand, if rL = m (i.e. if AL is an invertible matrix) then the system (5)\nof equations for s = 0 is equivalent to a system of equations of the form\n(7)\n\nl\n\nyip = L\u0303i (y1 , ..., ym ),\n\ni = 1, m, with L\u0303i as non-homogeneous linear forms; so in this case Y = Y0 and m1 = m.\n3.6.8.1.1. Corollary. Let m \u2208 N and let (E, \u03c4 ) be a pair comprising from a field\nE and an automorphism \u03c4 of it. Let Li (x1 , ..., xm) be linear forms in m variables with\ncoefficients in E, i = 1, m. We consider the difference system DS of equations\n(8)\n\nyi = Li (\u03c4 (y1 ), ..., \u03c4 (ym)),\n\ni = 1, m. We have: DS is non-empty, i.e. it has a solution in the difference closure of\n(E, \u03c4 ).\nProof: We recall that the difference closure is a pair (E1 , \u03c41 ), with E1 a field containing E and with \u03c41 an automorphism of it extending \u03c4 , such that each difference variety\nover (E, \u03c4 ) (see [Hr, \u00a75] for a definition) has a point in (E1 , \u03c41 ) and there is no subpair\n(E2 , \u03c42 ) of it, with E1 6= E2 , having all these properties. Its existence and uniqueness up\nto isomorphism can be proved in the same way as in the case of the algebraic closure of\na field.\nWe can assume (E, \u03c4 ) is equal to its difference closure. The emerging philosophy of E.\nHrushovski and A. Macintyre (see [Hr]) allows us to assume (via ultraproducts of fields)\nthat E = F and that \u03c4 is an integral, non-zero power q of its Frobenius automorphism\nhaving Fp as its fixed field. As the subfield of F generated by the coefficients of Li 's is\nfinite, we can assume q > 0. So the Corollary follows from 3.6.8.1.\n3.6.8.1.2. Corollary. Let m, n \u2208 N. Let R(0) be an Fp -algebra. Let Li (x1 , x2 , ..., xm)\nbe homogeneous linear forms in m variables with coefficients in R(0), i = 1, m. We have:\na) (the abstract surjectivity principle) For any m-tuple (c(1), ..., c(m)) of elements of R(1), with R(1) an Fp -algebra containing R(0), the system of equations\n(9)\n\nn\n\nn\n\nn\n\nxi = Li (xp1 , xp2 , ..., xpm ) + c(i),\n232\n\n\fi = 1, m, defines an \u00e9tale, affine Spec(R(1))-scheme Spec(R(2)). The resulting morphism\nm(2) : Spec(R(2)) \u2192 Spec(R(1)) is surjective.\nMoreover, there is an open, dense subscheme U (0) of Spec(R(0)) such that, regardless\nof the choice of the m-tuple (c(1), ..., c(m)), m(2) defines an \u00e9tale cover above U (1) :=\nSpec(R(1)) \u00d7Spec(R(0)) U (0).\nb) (the abstract constructibility property) Let R(\u221e) be the N-inductive limit\nof Fp -algebras R(q), q \u2208 N, q \u2265 2, with R(q) as the R(q \u22121)-algebra defined by a system of\nequations of the form of (9) but with c(i) replaced by some c(i)q \u2208 R(q\u22121), i = 1, m. Then\nthe image of any connected (resp. irreducible) component of Spec(R(\u221e)) in Spec(R(1)) is\na constructible, dense subset of a connected (resp. irreducible) component of Spec(R(1)).\nMoreover the image of any open closed subscheme of Spec(R(\u221e)) in Spec(R(1)) is an\nopen subscheme.\nb') (the AG property) If R(0) is of finite type over k, then Spec(R(\u221e)) is an AG\nk-scheme and so has the ALP property.\nc) If R(0) is a strictly henselian local ring, then the additive map\nL(n) : R(0)m \u2192 R(0)m\ndefined by\nn\n\nn\n\nn\n\nn\n\nL(n)(x1 , ..., xm ) := x1 \u2212 L1 (xp1 , ..., xpm ), ..., xm \u2212 Lm (xp1 , ..., xpm )\n\n\u0001\n\nis surjective. Moreover, all its fibres have the same number of elements equal to pnm1 ,\nfor some m1 \u2208 S(0, m).\nProof: We first prove a). As the number of the coefficients of the forms L1 ,..., Lm\nis finite, we can assume R(0) is a finitely generated Fp -algebra. In particular R(0) is a\nnoetherian ring. As in 7) we get that the system (9) of equations (of 3.6.8.1.2) defines an\n\u00e9tale, affine morphism m(2) : Spec(R(2)) \u2192 Spec(R(1)). 3.6.8.1 implies it is surjective.\nFor the last part, we can assume R(0) is an integral domain. So we just have to show\nthat U (2) := Spec(R(2)) \u00d7Spec(R) U (0) is finite over U (1), with U (0) a non-empty, open,\naffine subscheme of Spec(R(0)) which depends only on the forms Li , i = 1, m. We can\nalso assume that the pn -th roots of the coefficients of the linear forms Li are in R(0). So\nn\nn\nwe can write Li (xp1n , ..., xpm ) = L\u0303i (x1 , ..., xm)p , with L\u0303i as homogeneous linear forms.\nWe follow the proof of 3.6.8.1. We proceed by induction on m \u2208 N. The case m = 1\nis obvious. Let now m \u2265 2. If the linear forms L\u0303i are linearly dependent over the field\nof fractions K(0) of R(0), by localizing R(0) w.r.t. some non-zero element of it, we can\neliminate one variable as in the proof of 3.6.8.1; so the induction applies. If the linear\nforms L\u0303i are linearly independent over K(0), then they are linearly independent, over\nany point of a non-empty, open, affine subscheme U (0) of Spec(R(0)). So the systems of\nequations defining U (2) over U (1) can be put in a similar form to 3.6.8.1.0 (7) and so\nU (2) is a finite U (1)-scheme; we get: U (2) is an \u00e9tale cover of U (1). This proves the a)\npart.\n233\n\n\fb) and b') are a consequence of a) using standard noetherian induction on the topological space underlying the spectrum of the Fp -subalgebra of R(0) generated by the\ncoefficients of L1 ,..., Lm .\nc) is a direct consequence of 3.6.8.1 and of the \u00e9tale property expressed in a). This\nends the proof of the Corollary.\n3.6.8.1.3. Definitions. We assume R(0) is reduced. The maximal open subscheme\nU (0) of Spec(R(0)) having the property of 3.6.8.1.2 a) is called the Artin\u2013Schreier open\nsubscheme defined by the linear homogeneous forms L1 ,..., Lm . Using the reductions\nof L1 ,..., Lm modulo the ideal of R(0) defining the complement Spec(R(0)) \\ U (0) with\nits reduced scheme structure, we get similarly an Artin\u2013Schreier open subscheme U (1)\nof Spec(R(0)) \\ U (0): it is dense. In this way, by induction, we get a stratification of\nSpec(R(0)) in reduced, locally closed subschemes; as the Fp -subalgebra of R(0) generated\nby the coefficients of the forms L1 ,..., Lm is noetherian, this stratification has a finite\nnumber of strata U (q), q = 1, nL , where nL \u2208 N depends on Li 's. We call it the Artin\u2013\nSchreier stratification of Spec(R(0)) defined by the linear forms L1 ,..., Lm .\nLet now c(1),..., c(m) \u2208 R(0) be arbitrary elements. We take R(1) to be the R(0)algebra defined by the system (9) of equations; it is reduced as R(0) is. We similarly define\nthe refined Artin\u2013Schreier stratification of Spec(R(0)) defined by the linear homogeneous\nforms L1 ,..., Lm . The only difference: instead of U (0), we take its open closed subscheme\nU (0)\u2032 such that the number of geometric points of Spec(R(1)) above any geometric point\ny of U (0)\u2032 is maximal (i.e. does not depend on y and is strictly greater than the number\nof geometric points of Spec(R(1)) above geometric points of Spec(R(0)) \\ U (0)\u2032 ). So, as\nR(1) is an \u00e9tale R(0)-algebra, it is the stratification indexed by the number of geometric\npoints of Spec(R(1)) we get above geometric points of Spec(R(0)) (see also [EGA IV,\n15.5.9]). Its strata are similarly indexed: U (q)\u2032 , q = 1, n\u2032L , with n\u2032L \u2208 N. We have\nnL \u2032 \u2265 nL .\nThe nice think about above two stratifications of Spec(R(0)) is: their strata are\nnaturally indexed.\n3.6.8.1.4. Lemma (the first form of the purity principle). All Artin\u2013Schreier\nstratifications and all refined Artin\u2013Schreier stratifications satisfy the purity condition.\nProof: We can assume R(0) is a finitely generated, reduced Fp -algebra. The following well known result allows us to assume R(0) is as well integral and normal.\nExercise. Let S be an affine, reduced scheme. An open subscheme U of it is affine iff\nthe normalization U n of Ured in a finite, normal extension of the ring of fractions of S is.\nHint: We need to show U is affine if U n is. This is a consequence of Chevalley's theorem\n(see [Ha, Exc. 4.2 of p. 222]). Loc. cit. is stated with lots of unneeded hypotheses. Using\nthe fact that the morphism U n \u2192 U is surjective, we get that U is quasi-compact. So\nusing [EGA IV, \u00a78] we can assume S is finitely generated over a field; so loc. cit. applies\n(cf. also [Ma, 31.H]).\nUsing induction, we can assume q = 0. Let K(0) be the field of fractions of R(0).\nLet R(0)n be the normalization of R(0) in the ring of fractions K(1) of R(1). Spec(R(1))\n234\n\n\fis an open, affine subscheme of Spec(R(0)n ). So its complement C(1) is either empty or\nof pure codimension 1 (easy consequence of [Ma, th. 38, p. 124]). The same holds for its\nimage in Spec(R(0)) which is Spec(R(0)) \\ U (0). As R(0) is integral, U (0) = U (0)\u2032 . This\nends the proof.\n3.6.8.1.5. Remark. 3.6.8.1 and 3.6.8.1.1-4 remain valid if Li 's are not necessarily\n(homogeneous) linear forms (in m variables) but sums of monomials which are some ppowers (not necessarily equal) of just one of the variables involved. The reason is: we\ncan introduce new variables and equations of the form yi = xpi , so that the new system\nof equations is of the same form as the one of 3.6.8.1.2 a), with n = 1 and (potentially)\nwith an increased number of variables.\nWe come back to the proof of 3.6.1.2-3.\n3.6.8.2. Lemma (the explicit form of the surjectivity principle). There is\na reduced, closed subscheme B0 (k) of Gk not containing the origin, depending only on\nthe linear forms Lisl and not on the coefficients aisl , (i, s, l) \u2208 S(M ) \u00d7 S(M ) \u00d7 S(G),\nand such that the fibres of l0,1 above points of Spec(R0 /pR0 ) not belonging to B0 (k), are\nnon-empty.\nProof: All schemes to be introduced below are reduced. There is a closed subscheme\nR(0) of Spec(R0 /pR0 ), different from Spec(R0 /pR0 ), and such that denoting by T (0) its\nopen complement, the morphism l\u22121\n0,1 (T (0)) \u2192 T (0) is an \u00e9tale cover. By elementary\nmatrix operations we see that R(0) depends only on the linear forms Lisl and not on the\ncoefficients aisl (cf. 3.6.8.1.2 a) and its proof). We start constructing B0 (k).\nIn what follows J (\u0129) are finite set of indices, \u0129 = 0, d \u2212 1. All irreducible components\nof R(0) not passing through the origin of Gk will be locally closed subschemes Su (0), u \u2208\nJ (0), of B0 (k). For any irreducible component of R(0) passing through the origin of Gk ,\nwe have to repeat the argument. Let C 1 be the union of all such irreducible components,\nviewed as a connected, closed subscheme of Spec(R0 /pR0 ). There is (cf. 3.6.8.1.2 a)) an\nopen, dense subscheme T (1) of C 1 , again depending only on the reduction of Lisl 's modulo\nthe ideal of R0 /pR0 defining C 1 and not on the reduction modulo it of the coefficients\naisl , (i, s, l) \u2208 S(M ) \u00d7 S(M ) \u00d7 S(G), such that the k-morphism l\u22121\n0,1 (T (1)) \u2192 T (1) is\n1\nan \u00e9tale cover. Let R(1) be the subscheme of C defined by the complement of T (1) in\nC 1 . The irreducible components of R(1) not passing through the origin of Gk , will be\nsubschemes Su (1), u \u2208 J (1), of B0 (k). We keep going with those irreducible components\nof R(1) passing through the origin of Gk .\nBy induction on \u0129 \u2208 S(0, d \u2212 1) we construct (d is the dimension of Gk ):\na) a connected, closed subscheme C \u0129+1 of Spec(R0 /pR0 ) of dimension at most d\u2212\u0129\u22121,\nand which is either empty or contains the origin (so C d is either empty or is Zk );\nb) a maximal open, dense subscheme T (\u0129) of C \u0129 , with C 0 := Spec(R0 /pR0 ), such\nthat the k-morphism l\u22121\n0,1 (T (\u0129)) \u2192 T (\u0129) is an \u00e9tale cover;\nc) closed subschemes Su (\u0129) of Spec(R0 /pR0 ), u \u2208 J (\u0129); they are the irreducible\ncomponents not containing the origin of the closed subscheme of Spec(R0 /pR0 ) defined\n235\n\n\fas the complement R(\u0129) of T (\u0129) in C \u0129 .\nThe formula which allows us to apply the inductive argument is: C \u0129+1 is the union of\nthe irreducible components of R(\u0129) containing the origin. So, from constructions, R(d\u22121)\nis either empty or has dimension 0.\nB0 (k) is defined as the Zariski closure in Gk of the (finite) union of these subschemes\nSu (\u0129), u \u2208 J (\u0129), with \u0129 running from 0 to d \u2212 1. It does not contain the origin of Gk .\nFrom its construction we deduce that it does not depend on the coefficients aisl ,\n(i, s, l) \u2208 S(M ) \u00d7 S(M ) \u00d7 S(G), and that for any perfect field k1 containing k we have\nB0 (k1 ) = B0 (k)k1 . Moreover, we obviously have:\nFact. The disjoint union \u222a\u0129\u2208S(0,d) T (\u0129) is a stratification of the complement of Bk in\nSpec(R0 /pR0 ). Here T (d) is either empty or is Zk , depending on the fact that there is\nor there is not an \u0129 \u2208 S(0, d \u2212 1) such that Zk is a closed subscheme of T (\u0129). The Zariski\nclosure of any non-empty T (\u0129) contains Zk .\nFrom the Fact and b) the Lemma follows.\n9) End of the proof for the case n = 1. From the fact that the coefficients\n1\nof Lisl are in I we deduce that the closed subscheme l\u22121\n0,1 (Zk ) of S0 is Spec(k). This\nimplies iv) of 3.6.1.3 1). Related to the part of 3.6.1.3 2) referring to l0,1 , we just need to\n2\nshow that the fibres of l0,1 over geometric points have at most pd points. This can be\nchecked as follows. The equations of (3) of 5), are obtained working with the W (k)-basis\n{eis |i, s \u2208 S(M )} of End(M ). Using a second W (k)-basis of End(M ) such that a subbasis\nof it is a W (k)-basis of g, as we are dealing with connections respecting the G-action,\nour variables xijl 's are as well solution of a system of d2M d \u2212 d2 -linear equations with\ncoefficients in R0 /pR0 whose rank is precisely d2M d \u2212 d2 in each point of Spec(R0 /pR0 ).\nAs in the proof of 3.1.8.1, we can eliminate d2M d \u2212 d2 -variables at once: so S01 is a\nconnected component of an Spec(R0 /pR0 )-scheme obtained using a system of equations\nwith (coefficients in R0 /pR0 and with) the property that a subsystem of it is entirely\nsimilar to (3) of 5) but involving just d2 variables; so 3.6.8.1 applies to give us the desired\nbound on the number of points of geometric fibres of l0,1 . This ends the proof of 3.6.1.3\n1) and 2) involving n = 1.\n10) The inductive statement. By induction on n \u2208 N we prove 3.6.1.2 and 3.6.1.3\n1). We assume we managed to construct Q0,m , for any m \u2208 N smaller than n + 1. We\nnow construct Q0,n+1 and show that 3.6.1.2 holds for n + 1.\n\u2227\n11) The general form of a lift. Let l\u03030 : Spec(Q\u0303\u2227\n0 ) \u2192 Spec(Q0,n ) be a formally\n\u00e9tale, affine W (k)-morphism, with Q\u03030 a W (k)-algebra. The general form of a connection\non M \u2297W (k) Q\u03030 /pn+1 Q\u03030 lifting the scalar extension of \u2207n0 , is of the form\nX\n(10)\n\u2207 = \u2207n0 +\npn xisl eis \u2297 dtl (0),\n(i,s,l)\u2208S(M )\u00d7S(M )\u00d7S(G)\n\nwith all xisl 's belonging to Q\u03030 /pQ\u03030 ; here we still denote by \u2207n0 a fixed lift of the mentioned\nscalar extension to a connection on M \u2297W (k) Q\u03030 /pn+1 Q\u03030 respecting the G-action.\n236\n\n\f12) The key point. The condition that this connection \u2207 is a connection on\nMQ\u03030 /pn+1 MQ\u03030 is expressed by a system of equations involving xisl 's, which is of the\nsame type as the system (3) of 5). The key point is:\nFact. We get the same linear forms Lisl , \u2200(i, s, l) \u2208 S(M ) \u00d7 S(M ) \u00d7 S(G)!\nHowever, the new feature is that the free coefficients aisl of 5) are replaced by new\ncoefficients aisl (n) \u2208 Q0,n /pQ0,n . The fastest way to see this Fact and the new feature,\nis to use the same trick as in 8) (for G = GL(M ) they are obvious).\nAs the coefficients aisl have played no role in the steps 5) to 9), we can repeat the\narguments of 5) to 9). So we get a moduli scheme S n+1 of connections, which is an\n\u00e9tale scheme over S0n := Spec(Q0,n /pQ0,n ). We define S0n+1 in the similar manner: it is\nthe maximal open closed subscheme of S n+1 such that each connected component of it\nintersects the pull back of Zk through the natural k-morphism S n+1 \u2192 Spec(R0 /pR0 ).\nThis repetition takes care of 3.6.1.2 and of 3.6.1.3 1) for n + 1 (again iv) is implied\nby i), while 1) implies \u2013as in 7)\u2013 that \u2207n+1\nis integrable, nilpotent mod p, and respects\n0\nthe G-action).\n13) Some conclusions. 3.6.1.3 4) results from 3.6.1.3 1). 3.6.1.3 3) is obvious.\nThe fact that the morphism ln0 mod p is:\n\u2013 \u00e9tale, results from the same argument used in 7) (cf. also 3.6.8.1.2 a));\n\u2013 of finite type results from the construction of Spec(Q0,n+1 /pQ0,n+1 ) (it is a closed\nsubscheme of a scheme of finite type over S0n );\n2\n\n\u2013 quasi-finite, with geometric fibres of cardinality at most pd , results from the fact\nthat \u22070n+1 respects the G-action (and so we actually have only d2 variables) and from\nthe intersection theory (cf. 9)).\nThis takes care of 3.6.1.3 2).\n14) End of the proof. 3.6.1.3 5) and 6) are a consequence of the proof of 3.6.8.2\nand of Fact of 12) (cf. 3.6.8.1.2 a) and b')). More precisely, for any n \u2208 N we construct\nan open subscheme S1n of S0n , such that, under the W (k)-morphism ln0 , S1n+1 projects\nsurjectively onto S1n , as well as S11 , under the W (k)-morphism l0,1 , projects surjectively\nonto the open subscheme of Spec(R0 /pR0 ) defined by the complement of B0 (k).\nS1n is formed by removing from S0n the closed subscheme formed by the union of\n\u22121\n1\nall irreducible components of l\u22121\n0,n (C\u0129 ) not containing the closed subscheme l0,n (Zk ) =\nSpec(k), for C\u01291 running through all irreducible components of the scheme R(\u0129) defined\nin 3.6.8.2, with \u0129 as its turn running through the set S(0, d \u2212 1).\nWe check now that S1n+1 projects surjectively onto S1n (the argument for the fact\nthat S11 projects surjectively onto the open subscheme of Spec(R0 /pR0 ) defined by the\ncomplement of B0 (k) is entirely the same). First, any integral subscheme of S1n+1 containn\ning (resp. not containing) l\u22121\n0,n+1 (Zk ) = Spec(k) is mapped through l0 into an integral\n237\n\n\fsubscheme of S1n containing (resp. not containing) l\u22121\n0,n (Zk ) = Spec(k). So we do get a\nnatural \u00e9tale k-morphism\nl\u0304n0 : S1n+1 \u2192 S1n .\nTo check it is surjective, it is enough to show that any k\u0304-valued point yn of S1n lifts to a\nk\u0304-valued point of S1n+1 .\nLet \u0129n \u2208 S(0, d) be such that the image of yn in Spec(R0 /pR0 ) is a point of T (\u0129n )\n(see the notations of 3.6.8.2). As l\u0304n0 is an \u00e9tale k-morphism (and so its image is open),\nas (l0,m )\u22121 (T (\u0129n )) \u2192 T (\u0129n ), with m \u2208 {n, n + 1}, is an \u00e9tale cover (cf. 3.6.8.2 b) and\n3.6.8.1.2 a)), and as S1n+1 is a non-empty k-scheme (we have l\u22121\n0,n+1 (Zk ) = Spec(k) \u2282\nn+1\nn+1\nS1 ), we get that yn lifts to a k\u0304-valued point of S1 .\nThis ends the proof of 3.6.1.2-3.\n3.6.8.3. A digression. What follows is a digression meant just for specialists; it is\nneither quoted nor used anywhere else, besides the isolated remark 3.6.8.4 4).\nA natural question arises: how to compute the connections \u2207nj and so, how to\nconstruct the W (k)-morphisms lnj (write down the equations defining Qj,n )? This is not\nvery difficult (cf. 3.6.8 5); see also 3.6.8.5 and 3.6.18.4 below). Here, as a digression,\nwe show how using Shimura varieties of An type (n \u2208 N) we can construct a formally\n\u2227\n\u00e9tale, affine W (k)-morphism Spec(Q\u0303\u2227\nj,1 ) \u2192 Spec(Rj ) which factors through lj,1 . We can\nassume k is the algebraic closure of a countably generated field over Fp ; so in particular\nwe have k = k\u0304. We work again with only one index j: 0.\n1) MR0 is the pull back of MS0 through the inclusion i00 : U00 \u0592\u2192 W00 . So we can\nwork with MS0 instead of MR0 , i.e. we can assume from now on that G = GL(M ) and\nthat R0 = S0 .\n2) Substituting M with M\u0303 := M \u2295 W (k) and the direct sum decomposition M =\nF \u2295 F 0 with M\u0303 = F 1 \u2295 F\u0303 0 , where F\u0303 0 := F 0 \u2295 W (k), we replace the Shimura \u03c3-crystal\n(M, h\u03c60 , GL(M )) with the Shimura \u03c3-crystal (M\u0303 , \u03c6\u0303, GL(M\u0303 )) (with \u03c6\u0303 acting as h\u03c60 on\nM and as \u03c3 on the W (k) summand of M\u0303 ). This is achieved in the following 4 items.\n1\n\na) We choose arbitrarily a W (k)-basis {v1 , ..., vdM } of M ; it gives birth to a W (k)basis {v1 ,...,vdM +1 } of M\u0303 , where vdM +1 is 1 of the summand W (k) of M\u0303 .\nb) We view GL(M ) as a subgroup of GL(M\u0303 ) (with bM \u2208 GL(M )(W (k)) acting as\nbM on the summand M of M\u0303 and as the identity on the other summand W (k) of M\u0303 ).\nM\nc) We choose S\u03030 to be an open, affine subscheme of GL(M\u0303 ) of the form S0 \u00d7 G2d\n\u00d7\na\nGm (the Ga factors correspond to elements of GL(M\u0303 )(W (k)), viewed as matrices, having\n1 on the diagonal and 0 anywhere else, except at the intersection of an i1 -th row with\nan i2 -th column, where i1 and i2 are distinct elements of the set {1, 2, ..., dM + 1} such\nthat the intersection {i1 , i2 } \u2229 {dM + 1} is non-empty; the Gm factor is the subgroup of\nGL(M\u0303 ) normalizing the summand W (k) of M\u0303 and fixing M ). In order that such a choice\nof S\u03030 to be possible, we might have to replace S0 by a suitable open, affine subscheme of\nM\nit (cf. [SGA3, Vol. III, 4.1.2 of p. 172]; so S0 \u00d7 G2d\n\u00d7 Gm is embedded in GL(M\u0303 ) using\na\nproducts of elements, ordered adequately).\n238\n\n\fd) We choose a Frobenius lift of the p-adic completion of S\u03030 of the form \u03a6S0 \u00d7 \u03a61\n(corresponding to the above product decomposition of S\u03030 ), with \u03a61 as the Frobenius lift\nM\nof the p-adic completion of G2d\n\u00d7Gm = Spec(W (k)[x1 , ..., x2dM +1 ][ x2d 1 +1 ]) which takes\na\nM\nxs to xps , \u2200s \u2208 S(1, 2dM ), and x2dM +1 \u2212 1 to (x2dM +1 \u2212 1)p .\n3) The same argument which allowed us to assume G is GL(M ), allows us to replace\nGL(M ) with GL(M\u0303 ), if p|dM . So we can assume p does not divide dM .\n4) We remark that there is a SHS (f, L(p) , v) defined by an injective map f :\n\u0001\n(G0 , X) \u0592\u2192 GSp(W, \u03c8), S (here we put exceptionally a lower right index 0, i.e. we write\nG0 , 2e0 = dimQ (W ) and J0\u2032 , not to create confusion with the meaning of G = GL(M ),\neM = dimW (k) (G) = dimW (k) (GL(M )) and J \u2032 ) such that we have a natural monomorphism\nG = GL(M ) \u0592\u2192 G0W (k) ,\nresulting into a natural identification Gder\n0W (k) = SL(M ) (so the confusion between G and\nG0W (k) would have not been too serious), and having the property that the Shimura\nLie pairs attached to the Shimura group pairs (G, [\u03bc]) and (G1 , [\u03bc\u0303\u2217x ]), are isomorphic\n(cf. def. 2.2.5 3) and 4)). Here G1 is the subgroup of G0 W (k) generated by Gder\n0W (k)\nand by the image of any cocharacter \u03bc\u0303\u2217x : Gm \u2192 G0W (k) , whose extension, under an\nO(v) -monomorphism W (k) \u0592\u2192 C, is G0 (C)-conjugate to the cocharacters \u03bc\u2217x , x \u2208 X.\n1\n0\nSo Gder\n0R must be SU (p0 , q0 )R , with p0 := dimW (k) (F ) and q0 := dimW (k) (F ) =\ndimW (k) (M/F 1 ). We can take Gder\nto be an arbitrary Q\u2013form of Gder\n0\n0R which splits over\nQp (to be compared with Example 4 of 4.6 below). [Va2, 6.4.2] guarantees the existence\nof a SHS as above if p \u2265 5; the existence of such a SHS for p = 3 is not a problem: we\ncan assume we have a standard PEL situation (f, L(p) , v, B), cf. 2.3.5.1. For instance,\nif p0 = 1 and q0 = 2, we can work with a Picard surface Sh(G0 , X) (cf. [Go]) having\na reflex field E(G0 , X) in which p is totally split. The general case is just an obvious\nextension of the case p0 = 1, q0 = 2 (we have p0 q0 6= 0 due to 3.2.2.1). In what follows,\nas p does not divide dM , we assume (f, L(p) , v) is obtained as in [Va2, 6.5.1.1].\nWe have a natural \u00e9tale isogeny G1 \u2192 G = GL(M ) (as p does not divide dM ). It\nallows us to identify the completion of G1 in its origin with the completion Spec(O0 ) of\nG in its origin. So g1 := Lie(G1 ) = g.\n\n5) We now assume the existence of z \u2208 NW (k) /H0 (W (k)) (cf. the standard notations\n2.3.1-3 for the SHS introduced\n\u0001 in 4)), such that its attached Shimura filtered \u03c3-crystal\n1\nz\n\u2032\nMz , Fz , \u03c6z , G0 W (k) , (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J0 (cf. 2.3.10 and the assumption k = k\u0304) has the prop\u0001\nerty that the Shimura filtered Lie \u03c3-crystal g1 , \u03c6z , Fz0 (g1 ), Fz1 (g1 ) , which is naturally\na Lie p-divisible subobject of its attached Shimura filtered \u03c3-crystal (as g1 is naturally\na Lie subalgebra of Lie(G0W (k) )), is isomorphic to the Shimura filtered Lie \u03c3-crystal\n(End(M ), h\u03c60 , F 0 (End(M )), F 1 (End(M ))).\n6) From the assumed existence of z, we get that gR0 = End(M )S0 is (p-adically)\nalgebraizable. To explain what we mean by this, we start with a formally smooth W (k)morphism mz : Spec(O0 ) \u2192 NW (k) /H0 lifting z and such that the pull back (through\n239\n\n\fits composite with the natural morphism mnat : NW (k) /H0 \u2192 N /H0 ) of the p-divisible\ngroup DH0 of AH0 and of de Rham components of the family of Hodge cycles AH0 is\nnaturally endowed with), has associated to it a Shimura filtered F -crystal\nC := Mz , Fz1 , \u03c6z , G0W (k) , G1 , f \u0304, (tz\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J0\u2032\n\n\u0001\n\nover O0 /pO0 (with f \u0304 : O0 \u2192W\n \u0303 (k)[[z1 , ..., zeM ]] the W (k)-isomorphism naturally induced\nby the W (k)-morphism c0 of ii) before 3.6.0). The existence of mz , is just [Va2, 5.4] (cf.\nthe first two paragraphs of 2.3.11). Using Artin's approximation theorem (as in the proof\nof 2.3.15), we get:\nl\n\n1\n7) a smooth morphism Spec(S1 ) \u2192\nNW (k) /H0 and a formally \u00e9tale, affine morphism\n\nl\n\n\u2207\nSpec(S1\u2227 ) \u2192 W10 := Spec(S0 ) \u00d7G G1 such that the p-divisible object of MF[0,1]\n(S1 )\n\u22121\nassociated to (mnat \u25e6 l1 ) (DH0 ) can be put in the form\n\n\u0001\nCl1 = Mz \u2297W (k) S1\u2227 , Fz1 \u2297W (k) S1\u2227 , h1 (\u03c6z \u2297 1), \u2207z ,\n\nwith h1 \u2208 G0 W (k) (S1\u2227 ) which mod p is defined by l (we view Spec(S0 ) \u00d7G G1 as an open\nsubscheme of G1 and so as a locally closed subscheme of G0 W (k) ); if pr1 : Spec(S1\u2227 ) \u2192\nSpec(S0\u2227 ) is the p-adic completion of the composite of l with the projection W10 \u2192\nSpec(S0 ), then we choose the Frobenius lift \u03a6S1 of S1\u2227 such that the diagram\nSpec(S1\u2227 )\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\u03a6\ny S1\n\nSpec(S1\u2227 )\n\npr1\n\n\u2212\u2192 Spec(S0\u2227 )\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\u03a6\ny S0\npr1\n\n\u2212\u2192 Spec(S0\u2227 )\n\nis cartesian. Warning: the fact that we chose \u03a6S1 to be obtained via l and pr1 , means\nthat we know that h1 only mod p is defined by l;\nd0\n\n8) a point Spec(W (k)) \u0592\u2192 Spec(S1 ) such that l1 \u25e6 d0 = z and l \u25e6 d\u2227\n0 is the origin of\n0\nW1 \u2282 G1 ;\n9) modulo a power Idn0 (n \u2208 N\\{1}) of the ideal Id0 of S1 defining d0 , Cl1 is isomorphic\nto C modulo the n-th power of the ideal of O0 defining the origin of Spec(O0 ).\n7) to 9) are just a variant of 2.3.15: the fact that we are not mentioning the polarizations, allows us (see also 2.3.14) to work such a variant in the context of G0 W (k) itself\nand not only of G00 W (k) ; by removing extra variables (in the same way we got 2.3.15.1\nfrom 2.3.15), we can assume h1 mod p is defined by l.\n10) So the Lie p-divisible subobject of the Lie p-divisible object End(Cl1 ) of\n\u2207\nMF[\u22121,1]\n(S1 ), whose underlying S1\u2227 -module is g \u2297W (k) S1\u2227 , is\n\u0001\ngS1 := g \u2297W (k) S1\u2227 , h1 (\u03c6z \u2297 1), F 0 (g) \u2297W (k) S1\u2227 , F 1 (g) \u2297W (k) S1\u2227 , \u2207z .\n240\n\n\f11) So the pull back of End(MS0 )/pEnd(MS0 ) = gS0 /pgS0 through pr1 , can be\n\u2207\nviewed as a Lie object (identifiable with gS1 /pgS1 ) of MF[\u22121,1]\n(S1 ). This implies the\n1\nexistence of an \u00e9tale k-morphism Spec(S1 /pS1 ) \u2192 S0 which composed with l0,1 (see 3.6.8\n5) for notations) is the k-morphism Spec(S1 /pS1 ) \u2192 Spec(S0 /pS0 ) defined by taking pr1\nmod p.\nIn other words, we can regain the connection of MS1 /pMS1 from the one of Mz \u2297W (k)\nS1\u2227 and from the one of End(MS1 )/pEnd(MS1 ). In fact, from the proof of [Va2, 6.5.1.1],\nas G0 Zp is a split group, we get that (cf. also 2.3.16.1 for the passage from the Lie algebras\ncontext of 5) to the level of GL-groups) we can assume there is a monomorphism\niz : (M, F 1 , h\u03c60 ) \u0592\u2192 (Mz , Fz1 , \u03c6z )\nbetween p-divisible objects of MF[0,1] (W (k)), with iz (M ) as a direct summand of Mz\nnormalized by G0 W (k) and such that the image of G0 W (k) in GL(iz (M )) is GL(iz (M ))\nitself.\n12) If there is no z \u2208 NW (k) /H0 (W (k)) as in 5), we have to choose\nz0 \u2208 NW (k) /H0 (W (k))\n\u0001\nsuch that its attached Shimura filtered \u03c3-crystal Mz0 , Fz10 , \u03c6z0 , G0 W (k) has the property\n\u0001\nthat its corresponding Shimura Lie \u03c3-crystal g, \u03c6z0 , Fz00 (g), Fz10 (g) is isomorphic to a\nShimura filtered Lie \u03c3-crystal\n\u0001\nEnd(M ), g3\u03c60 , F 0 (End(M )), F 1 (End(M )) ,\n\nwith g3 \u2208 GL(M )(W (k)) a W (k)-valued point of a \"small\" open subscheme U3 of U0 \u2229U2\ncontaining h (cf. 2.3.16). Let U30 be the right translate of U3 by h\u22121 .\nGoing once more through the arguments of 5) to 11) but performed just mod p,\nwe can use this part involving a \"near by\" point z0 , to get that the spectrum Z\u0303 of the\nnormalization of the S0 /pS0 -subalgebra of R\u030200 /pR\u030200 (we recall that R0 = S0 ) generated\nby the coefficients of \u03b2 of 3.6.8 1) taken mod p, is generically \u00e9tale over Spec(S0 /pS0 ).\nAs some trouble might result if S 1 is not connected or if (theoretically) it is of\ndimension greater than eM , this statement on Z\u0303 can be seen in two ways. Either by\nrecalling that the system (4) of equations of 3.6.8 6) gives birth to an \u00e9tale scheme over\nSpec(S0 /pS0 ) (so somehow we go back to the general ideas) or by using the Kodaira\u2013\nSpencer map (here is the place where we need U3 to be \"small\": we can assume that\nthis map defined using the coefficients of the mentioned \u03b2 still has a image of the right\nrank in g3 mod p) and an argument of gluing (performed around a suitable point of U3 k )\nentirely similar to the one of 3.6.2.1 d) but performed mod p. The need of working mod\np is implied by the fact that we do not know a priori that the spectrum of the S0 -algebra\ngenerated by the coefficients of \u03b2, is smooth over W (k) in a (suitable) W (k)-valued point\nof it lifting g3 ; on the other hand we can assume that g3 mod p lifts to a smooth point\nof Z\u0303. So the lifting property of 3.6.18.5.2 below used in a relative context (see 3.6.18.7\n241\n\n\fbelow) implies that the gluing argument of 3.6.2.1 d) can be performed (i.e. taken) mod\np as well.\nWe do not detail fully this second way here, as actually a point z as in 5) always\nexists: as k = k\u0304, 3.6.15 A below applies, as we can assume N has the completion\nproperty (cf. 4.12.12.0 below). We just point out that it is based on the fact that\nwe can \"regain\" Spec(S0 /pS0 ), from the (coefficients w.r.t. some k-basis of M/pM of\nthe) Frobenius endomorphism of the S0 /pS0 -module underlying MS0 /pMS0 . The above\nmentioned gluing argument performed mod p, is the only way we can presently think of\nshowing that Z\u0303 is an \u00e9tale Spec(R0 /pR0 )-scheme, without using the general theory (of\nequations) of 3.6.8 but just using the fact (here is the place where z0 \u2013and so g3 \u2013 plays a\nrole) that it has a suitable section (cf. 5) to 11) performed mod p) in the \u00e9tale topology.\n3.6.8.4. Remarks. 1) The special form of the Frobenius endomorphism of M \u2297W (k)\nR0 played no role in the proofs of 3.6.1.2-3. This allows us to use the method employed\nin 3.6.8 in (all) other situations (for instance in 3.6.18.4 below).\n2) In the proof of the surjectivity principle (for instance, of 3.6.8.2), the special shape\nof U0 played no role. So it can be used in all other situations.\n3) The Frobenius lift \u03a6R0 of R0\u2227 did play a role in the above proofs of 3.6.1.2-3; it is\nnot entirely essential: if we are dealing with an arbitrary Frobenius lift of R0\u2227 , (DIV) of\n3.6.8 5) still applies to give us systems of equations of the same shape as of (3) of 3.6.8\n5). However, for the case of a general type of a Frobenius lift of R0\u2227 , 3.6.1.3 i) and all\nthe other parts of 3.6.1.3 depending on it have to be reformulated (so 3.6.1.2 has to be\nreformulated as well), see 3.6.18.8.3 below.\n4) Let (f, L(p) , v) be a SHS defined by an injective map f : (G0 , X) \u0592\u2192 (GSp(W, \u03c8), S);\nin order to refer to 3.6.8.3, we use G0 instead of G. If we already know that the Shimura\nfiltered \u03c3-crystal (M, F 1 , h\u03c60 , G) is isomorphic to the Shimura filtered \u03c3-crystal attached\nto a point z : Spec(W (k)) \u2192 NW (k) /H0 , then 3.6.8.3 is significantly simplified: the replacement of G by GL(M ) (see 3.6.8.3 1) to 3)) is not needed. This implies that (for\n3.6.8.3) we do not need the property ii) of the beginning of 3.6, as well as in 3.6.0 we do\nnot need the \"complication\" with W0 , W2 , W00 , W20 , \u03a6S0 , \u03a6S2 , etc.\n5) We do not know if (or when) we have Spec(Q0,n /pQ0,n ) = S n . We do expect this\nequality (at least in the majority of cases).\n3.6.8.5. The closed subscheme B0 (k). It is very much desirable to have a good\ndescription of the closed subscheme B0 (k) of Gk introduced in 3.6.8.2. In what follows\nwe explain a simpler approach for determining its intersection with U00 .\nIt is enough to determine B0 (k\u0304) (cf. 3.6.8.2); so we can assume k = k\u0304. We choose\nthe W (k)-basis {ei |i \u2208 S(M )} of M in such a way that:\nThere is a permutation \u03c0\u0303 of the set S(M ) with the property that h\u03c60 (ei ) mod p is\neither 0 or is e\u03c0\u0303(i) mod p.\nThe existence of such a W (k)-basis is guaranteed by [Mu, cor. p. 143], applied to\nthe \u03c3-linear map M/pM \u2192 M/pM defined by h\u03c60 mod p, and by the standard Jordan\nform of a nilpotent \u03c3-linear endomorphism (this is the same as in the k-linear context).\n242\n\n\f1) Rewriting the equations of 3.6.8 5) skillfully, for the above chosen W (k)-basis of\nM , we come across equations of the form\ntl (0)p\u22121 xpisl = L\u0303isl (x11l , x12l , ..., xdM dM l ) + b\u0303isl ,\n\n(11)\n\n\u2200(i, s, l) \u2208 S(M ) \u00d7 S(M ) \u00d7 S(G) such that h\u03c60 (es ) is zero mod p and h\u03c60 (ei ) is non-zero\nmod p, and of the form\n(12)\n\nL\u0303isl (x11l , ..., xdM dM l ) = b\u0303isl ,\n\n\u2200(i, s, l) \u2208 S(M ) \u00d7 S(M ) \u00d7 S(G) such that h\u03c60 (es ) is non-zero mod p or h\u03c60 (es ) and\nh\u03c60 (ei ) are both 0 mod p. Here L\u0303isl is a homogeneous linear form and b\u0303isl \u2208 R0 /pR0 ,\n\u2200(i, s, l) \u2208 S(M ) \u00d7 S(M ) \u00d7 S(G).\nThese equations are obtained by first plugging es in the equations (1) and (2) of 3.6.8\n4) and then identifying the coefficients of r0 \u25e6  \u0303l0 (ei )dtl (0), (i, s, l) \u2208 S(M ) \u00d7 S(M ) \u00d7 S(G)\n(we recall that \u03a6(Q\u03030 )0 = r0 \u25e6  \u0303l0 (h\u03c60 \u2297 1), cf. 3.6.1.1.1).\n2) Denoting\nyisl := tl (0)xisl ,\n\u2200(i, s, l) \u2208 S(M ) \u00d7 S(M ) \u00d7 S(G), this system of equations (defined by (11) and (12))\n] is equivalent to a system of equations of the form\nwhen restricted to R0 /pR0 [ Qd 1\ni=1\n\nti (0)\n\np\nyisl\n= L\u0303isl (y11l , ..., ydM dM l ) + tl (0)b\u0303isl ,\n\n(13)\n\nif (i, s) \u2208 S(M ) \u00d7 S(M ) is such that h\u03c60 (es ) mod p is 0 and h\u03c60 (ei ) is non-zero mod p,\nand of the form\n(14)\n\nL\u0303isl (y11l , ..., ydM dM l ) = tl (0)b\u0303isl ,\n\nif (i, s) \u2208 S(M ) \u00d7 S(M ) is such that h\u03c60 (es ) mod p is non-zero or h\u03c60 (es ) and h\u03c60 (ei )\nare both 0 mod p; here l runs through the elements of S(G).\nThis new system of equations is simpler than the one in 3.6.8 5). It can be used\nto get a very good description of the intersection of R(0) (of the proof of 3.6.8.2) with\nSpec(R0 /pR0 [ Qd 1\n]).\ni=1\n\nti (0)\n\n3) Similarly, for any subset S(t) of S(G), reducing the system of equations of 2) to\n1\n], we get a system of equations similar to the one in\nR0 /(p, (ti (0))i\u2208S(t) )[ Q\nti (0)\ni\u2208S(G)\\S(t)\n\u0001\n2), involving yisl , (i, s, l) \u2208 S(M ) \u00d7 S(M ) \u00d7 S(G) \\ S(t) . It is easier to determine the\n1\nintersection of B0 (k) with Spec(R0 /(p, (ti(0))i\u2208S(t) )[ Q\n]) using it instead of\nt (0)\ni\u2208S(G)\\S(t)\n\ni\n\nanother one, similar to the one of 3.6.8 5). This motivates why we get simplifications if\nwe work under the convenience assumption of 3.6.1.1.3.\n4) Let now G\u0303 be a smooth subgroup of G having connected fibres and such that the\nLie algebra of its generic fibre is normalized by h\u03c60 . The whole of 3.6.1.3 can be redone\n243\n\n\fin this context (cf. 3.6.1.6), with the group G replaced by G\u0303. Warning: not to complicate\nthe story, below we use the same notations, with G being replaced everywhere by G\u0303.\n3.6.8.6. The matrix form of the equations of 3.6.8. For future references, and\nfor small applications in 3.6.8.7 and 3.6.18.7 below, we include here as well the matrix\nform of the equations of 3.6.8 5). We consider a W (k)-basis {e1 , ..., edM } of M as in 3.6.8\n2), such that {e1 , ..., edimW (k) (F 1 )} is a W (k)-basis of F 1 .\nFor l \u2208 S(G), let Xl be the square matrix whose entries are xisl 's. Let EG be the\nsquare matrix with entries in R0 /pR0 of the R0 /pR0 -endomorphism of M \u2297W (k) R0 /pR0\nthat takes ei mod p into \u03a6(Q\u03030 )1 (ei ) mod p if i \u2208 S(1, dimW (k) (F 1 )) and into \u03a6(Q\u03030 )0 (ei )\nmod p if i \u2208 S(1 + dimW (k) (F 1 ), dM ), computed w.r.t. the R0 /pR0 -basis of M \u2297W (k)\nR0 /pR0 defined naturally by the chosen W (k)-basis {e1 , ..., edM } of M . Let Mh\u03c60 be\nthe square matrix of the k-endomorphism of M/pM that takes ei mod p into h\u03c60 ( p1 ei )\nmod p if i \u2208 S(1, dimW (k) (F 1 )) and into h\u03c60 (ei ) mod p if i \u2208 S(1 + dimW (k) (F 1 ), dM ),\ncomputed similarly. We view Mh\u03c60 as having entries in R0 /pR0 . Let\n\u03c0(F 0 ) : MdM (R0 /pR0 ) \u2192 MdM (R0 /pR0 )\nbe the R0 /pR0 -linear projector which takes a matrix A \u2208 MdM (R0 /pR0 ) having entries\n(aij )i,j\u2208S(1,dM ) into the matrix whose entries (\u00e3ij )i,j\u2208S(1,dM ) are defined by the rule: \u00e3ij\nis aij if i > dimW (k) (F 1 ) and j \u2264 dimW (k) (F 1 ) and is 0 otherwise.\nWe write\nd(EG ) =\n\nd\nX\n\nCl dtl (0),\n\nl=1\n\nwith Cl 's as square matrices with entries in R0 /pR0 and with the d-operator acting on a\nmatrix via its action on the entries. So now, the equations of 3.6.8 5) can be rewritten\nin the matrix form as follows\n(M F )\n\n[p] \u0001\n\nCl + Xl EG = EG \u03c0(F 0 ) tl (0)p\u22121 Xl\n\n,\n\n\u2200l \u2208 S(G).

As MR0 is a p-divisible object, EG and Mh\u03c60 are invertible matrices.\nSo (MF) can be put as well in the following convenient matrix form\n(CM F )\n\n[p] \u0001\n\n\u22121\nCl EG\n+ Xl = EG \u03c0(F 0 ) tl (0)p\u22121 Xl\n\n\u22121\n,\nEG\n\n\u2200l \u2208 S(G).\n\u22121\n3.6.8.6.1.

As\n0\n1\n0\nthe direct sum decomposition M = F \u2295 F is defined by the cocharacter \u03bc of G, we\nhave\nDG \u2208 G(R0 /pR0 )\n\n244\n\n\fand\n\u03c0(F 0 )(g/pg \u2297k R0 /pR0 ) \u2282 g/pg \u2297k R0 /pR0 .\nFor this last inclusion we use the standard identification of MdM (R0 ) with End(M \u2297W (k)\n\u22121\n\u22121\nR0 ) defined naturally by the chosen W (k)-basis of M . So Cl Mh\u03c6\n= dDG and Cl EG\n=\n0\n\u22121\ndDG DG belong to g/pg \u2297k R0 /pR0 . We have:\n[p] \u0001 \u22121\nFact. If Xl \u2208 g/pg \u2297k R0 /pR0 , then EG \u03c0(F 0 ) tl (0)p\u22121 Xl EG\n\u2208 g/pg \u2297k R0 /pR0 .\n\nProof: As we are dealing with W (k)-bases of M and not with R0\u2227 -bases of M \u2297W (k)\nR0\u2227 , the statement of the Fact has a linear aspect. So we can assume k = k\u0304 and that\n{e1 , ..., edM } is in fact a Zp -basis of a Zp -module MZp of M constructing as in 2.2.9 8)\n[p]\nbut for (M, F 1 , h\u03c60 , G). In such a case Xl \u2208 g/pg \u2297k R0 /pR0 and Mh\u03c60 \u2208 G(W (k)).\nThe Fact follows.\nSo, in our context of connections respecting the G-action, we can view (CMF) as\n|S(G)| equalities between elements of g/pg \u2297k R0 /pR0 or as an equality between two\nelements of g/pg \u2297k \u03a9R0 /pR0 /k .\n\nSimilarly, when passing from things mod pn to things mod pn+1 , we come across a\nsystem of equations SEn which can be put in a similar to (MF) or to (CMF) matrix form;\nthe only difference: Cl gets replaced by some other matrix Cl (n), l \u2208 S(G). Moreover,\n\u22121\n\u22121\n, Cl (n)EG\n\u2208\nin our context of connections respecting the G-action, we have Cl (n)Mh\u03c6\n0\ng/pg \u2297k R0 /pR0 . So we can view as well SEn as |S(G)| equalities between elements of\ng/pg \u2297k R0 /pR0 .\n3.6.8.6.2. Digression. If we choose a different Frobenius lift of R0\u2227 which mod p2\ntakes all ideals (tl (0))'s into themselves, then following the pattern of 3.6.8 5), we get a\nsystem of equations which can be put similarly in the matrix form: the only difference\nwe have is that the matrix which is tl (0)p\u22121 times the identity matrix IdM of MdM (R0 )\nis replaced by another scalar multiple of IdM . More generally, if we consider an arbitrary\n[p]\nFrobenius lift of R0\u2227 , then \u2200l \u2208 S(G), the matrix tl (0)p\u22121 Xl has to be substituted by a\nlinear combination\n(COM B)\n\nX\n\n[p]\n\nbll\u2032 Xl\u2032 ,\n\nl\u2032 \u2208S(G)\n\nwhere all bll\u2032 's are elements of R0 /pR0 .\n3.6.8.7. The abelian situation. We assume now that we are in the context of\n3.6.8.5 4), with G\u0303 an abelian group. We speak about the abelian situation. The nice\nthing in this case is:\nFact. \u2200(i, s, l) \u2208 S(M )\u00d7S(M )\u00d7S(G\u0303), the coefficients of L\u0303isl are elements of W (k).\n\u2207nj\n\nProof: This is a consequence of the fact that G\u0303 is abelian and that the connections\nwe get respect the G\u0303-action. In other words, referring to (MF) above with EG (resp.\n245\n\n\fDG ) being denoted by EG\u0303 (resp. by DG\u0303 ), we have: DG\u0303 commutes with Xl , \u2200l \u2208 S(G\u0303);\nso (MF) can be rewritten as\n[p] \u0001\n\n\u22121\nDG\u0303\nCl + Xl Mh\u03c60 = Mh\u03c60 \u03c0(F 0 ) tl (0)p\u22121 Xl\n\n,\n\n\u2200l \u2208 S(G\u0303). The Fact follows.\nFrom Fact and 3.6.8.5 2) we get: in the abelian situation the open subscheme T (0)\nof Spec(R0 /pR0 ) introduced in the proof of 3.6.8.2, contains Spec(R0 /pR0 [ Q 1 t (0) ]).\ni\u2208S(G\u0303)\n\ni\n\nThe argument can be repeated for the closed subscheme Spec(R0 /(p, (ti (0))i\u2208S(t) ), with\nS(t) an arbitrary subset of S(G\u0303), to get the following result:\n\n3.6.8.8. Proposition. Under the convenience assumption, in the abelian situation,\nthe W (k)-morphisms lj,n when taken mod p, n \u2208 N, are defining \u00e9tale covers of (i.e.\nabove) the locally closed subschemes of Spec(Rj /pRj ) defined by making some of the\nvariables ti (j) to be 0 while inverting all others. In particular, we can take Bj (k) to be\nthe empty scheme.\n3.6.8.9. The constancy property. We call the fact that when we pass in the proof\nof 3.6.1.2-3 from things mod p to things mod pn , we get the same homogeneous forms\n(see 3.6.8 (3) and (4), 3.6.8.5 (11), (12), (13) and (14), and 3.6.8 12)), as the constancy\nproperty. A system of equations with coefficients in an Fp -algebra and which can be put\nin the same shape as of (3) is said to be of first type. The system of equations defined by\n(11) and (12) is said to be of additive second type. The system of equations defined by\n(13) and (14) is said to be of adjusted additive second type. For extra terminology see\n3.6.18.4.6.\nAs (implicitly) mentioned in 3.6.8.4 1) and 3), this constancy property remains true\nin the context of a (truncation of a) p-divisible object of MF[0,1](R), with R a regular,\nformally smooth W (k)-algebra whose p-adic completion is equipped with a Frobenius lift\n\u03a6R . We can replace everywhere MF[0,1] by MF[c,c+1], c \u2208 Z. So, the natural question\narises:\nQ. What about (truncations of ) p-divisible objects of MF[a,b] (R), with a, b \u2208 Z,\nb \u2265 a + 2, which are not p-divisible objects of MF[c,c+1](R) for some c \u2208 S(a, b)?\nLet C = (MR , (F i (MR ))i\u2208S(a,b) , \u03a6MR ), with MR a projective R\u2227 -module, be such\na p-divisible object. Due to the fact that the connections have to satisfy the Griffiths\ntransversality condition, the counting argument (of equations and variables) performed\nbefore 3.6.8.1, gives us in this context (of C), more equations than variables. Assuming\nthat \u03a9R/pR/k is a free R/pR-module of rank rR \u2208 N and that MR is as well free, to\nget a connection on C/pC is the same thing as to solve (in R/pR) a (suitable) system of\nequations of the following form:\n(15)\n\nxi + ci = Li (xp1 , ..., xpm),\n246\n\n\ffor i \u2208 S(1, m), and\n(16)\n\nci = Li (xp1 , ..., xpm),\n\nfor i \u2208 S(m + 1, m + s); based on 3.6.1.1.1 4), the argument for this is entirely the same\nas the one of 3.6.8 5) relying on its (DIV). Here ci \u2208 R/pR and Li is a homogeneous\nlinear form with coefficients in R/pR, \u2200i \u2208 S(1, m + s), while m, s \u2208 N \u222a {0}. We have:\n\u2013 m + s is rR times the rank of End(MR );\n\u2013 m is rR times the rank of the F \u22121 -filtration of End(MR ) defined by (F i (MR ))i\u2208S(a,b) .\nOur assumption of the question (pertaining to c \u2208 Z) implies s > 0. In general, if\ns > 0 we say that a system of equations of the same type as (15) and (16) with coefficients\nin an Fp -algebra, is of third type (in m variables and s extra equations).\nIn our situation (of C) ms > 0 and so it easy to see that there are systems of equations\nof the above type which do not have any solution or which do not define an \u00e9tale scheme\nover Spec(R/pR). However the constancy property remains:\nThe constancy property. Let n \u2208 N. To lift a connection on C/pn C to a connection on C/pn+1 C, is the same thing as to solve (in R/pR) a similar system of equations as\nof the one of (15) and (16) above but where ci is replaced by ci (n) \u2208 R/pR, \u2200i \u2208 S(1, m+s)\n(this holds even if C is a p-divisible object of MF[c,c+1](R) for some c \u2208 S(a, b): in such\na case s = 0).\nThis is still a very useful fact: see 3.6.18.5.5, 3.6.18.8 and 3.6.18.8.1 b) below. Also\nthe following two approaches can produce lots of results.\nA1. (15) defines (cf. 3.6.8.1.2 a)) an \u00e9tale, affine Spec(R/pR)-scheme Spec(R1 ). So\nto have (16) satisfied as well we just need to consider the closed subscheme Spec(R2 ) of\nSpec(R1 ) of solutions of (16); we are interested only in its maximal open closed subscheme\nwhich is \u00e9tale over Spec(R/pR). We refer to Spec(R1 ) as the \u00e9tale part of the system of\nequations defined by (15) and (16).\nA2. For many W (k)-algebras R (like the local strictly henselian ones), the above\nsystem of equations defined by (15) and (16), when viewed as being in the m + s variables\nx1 ,..., xm , cm+1 ,..., cm+s , has a solution in R/pR, regardless of the values of the coefficients c1 ,..., cm or of the forms Li 's. Using this, one could get nice criteria of when 3.6.8\nabove can be worked out for such a (truncation of a) p-divisible object C, after suitable\nmodifications (corresponding to the new values of cm+1 ,..., cm+s ) of \u03a6MR . We hope to\ncome back to these ideas in a future paper: the reason we do not persuade them here is\nrelated to the fact that we have not being able to fully understand how these \"suitable\nmodifications\" could be performed. Here we just mention two things:\na) these \"suitable modifications\" should be performed only from lifting things mod\np to things mod pn+1 , n \u2208 N, so that the shapes of the forms Li 's do not get changed;\nn\n\n247\n\n\fb) to perform them for lifting things in the context of a), everything comes down to\nsolving some linear partial differential systems of equations of the form\n(LP DSEQ)\n\n\u2202f0\n= a j f0 + bj ,\n\u2202wj\n\n\u2200j \u2208 S(1, rR ), with f0 and all aj 's and bj 's in End(MR /pMR ) and with w1 ,..., wrR \u2208 R/pR\nsuch that {dw1 , ..., dwrR } is an R/pR-basis of \u03a9R/pR/k ; here bj 's are related to elements\ncm+1 ,..., cm+s of R obtained as above (i.e. such that they are part of a solution of suitable\nsystems of equations similar to the one defined by (15) and (16)).\nUnfortunately, even if R/pR = k[[w1 , ..., wrR ]] such a system (LPDSEQ) does not\nnecessarily have a solution.\nComing back to systems of equations of third type, we have the following Corollary\nof 3.6.8.1.\n3.6.8.9.0. Corollary. The number of solutions of a system of equations of third\ntype in m equations and s extra variables with coefficients in an algebraically closed field\nk1 of characteristic p, is either 0 or of the form pm1 , where m1 \u2208 S(0, m).\nProof: We use the notations of (15) and (16) above, with the role of R being replaced\nby the one of k1 . If Lm+1 ,..., Lm+s are all 0, then the Corollary is obvious (based on\n3.6.8.1). If one of these s linear forms is non-zero and m > 2, then taking the p-th root\nof it, as in 3.6.8.1 we can eliminate one variable and the sum m + s drops by 1 at least;\nwarning: s itself does not necessarily drop by 1. Using induction on m+s, we are reduced\nto the case m = 1, which is trivial, or to the case s = 0, which is handled by 3.6.8.1.\nWarning: under specialization, the number of solutions of a system of equations of\nthird type can increase.\n3.6.8.9.1. Comment. It is worth commenting why for some time (see [Va13]) we\nthought that we can work out 3.6.1.3 using (mod p) just \u00e9tale, affine morphisms instead\nof N-pro-\u00e9tale, affine morphisms. Referring to 3.6.1.3, once we obtained Qj,1 , we thought\nthat the free coefficients aisl (n) of 3.6.8 12) we obtain inductively for n \u2208 N, do not\ndepend on n. But most common this is not so.\nHowever, in many cases, proceeding as follows, we can avoid the passage (mod p) to\nN-pro-\u00e9tale morphisms. Warning: what follows has to be interpreted up to a passage to\nan \u00e9tale Spec(Qj,n )-scheme, for some n \u2208 N; so Spec(Qj,m ), with m \u2265 n, are replaced\naccordingly by resulting pull backs. We have to make a decision:\nDecision. Either we work with \"wild\" connections (their behavior modulo high powers of the prime p can not be controlled, i.e. can not be prescribed a priori) but with a\nvery nice (for instance, like in 3.6.1) Frobenius endomorphism of M \u2297W (k) Rj , and so\nlater on we hope to get (sort of ) a completion property (see 3.6.15 A) and (of ) a slice\nprinciple (see \u00a77), or we work with very nice connections and with a very \"wild\" Frobenius\nendomorphism of M \u2297W (k) Rj .\n248\n\n\fWe explain this. We have the following obvious property:\nFact. The homogeneous linear forms Lisl of 3.6.8 (3) depend only on the expressions\nof \u03a6(Rj )0 and \u03a6(Rj )1 mod p and of the expression of \u03a6Rj mod p2 .\nBut the coefficients aisl (n) depend on the expressions of these three maps modulo\nhigher powers of p. But we can try to modify \u03a6(Qj,1 )0 and \u03a6(Qj,1 )1 with something\nwhich is 0 mod p (so we do not change the forms Lisl , and so we do not affect the \u00e9tale\nproperty expressed in 3.6.1 through rj mod p being a universal element), in order to make\naisl (n) = 0, \u2200(i, s, l) \u2208 S(M ) \u00d7 S(M ) \u00d7 S(G) and \u2200n \u2208 N, n \u2265 m for some given m \u2208 N:\nfirst we can try to modify \u03a6(Qj,1 )0 and \u03a6(Qj,1 )1 modulo p2 to get all aisl (1)'s to be 0\nand then, looking at what results, we can try to modify it mod p3 by something which\nis 0 mod p2 to get all aisl (2)'s to be 0, etc. Warning: we want all these modifications\nnot to change \u03a6(Qj,1 )0 and \u03a6(Qj,1 )1 modulo the ideal defining the lift (it is unique) to\nSpec(Qj,1 ) of the origin a0 of Spec(Rj ).\nWhy should this be possible? Answer: there are four reasons. First, \u2200(l, n) \u2208\nS(G)\u00d7N, we can assume the endomorphism of M \u2297W (k) Qj,n /pQj,n defined by the square\nmatrix whose coefficients are aisl (n), i, s \u2208 S(M ), is an element of g \u2297W (k) Qj,n /pQj,n\n(see the part of 3.6.8.6.1 referring to 3.6.8.6 (CMF)). Second, any time we have to pass\nfrom things mod pn to things mod pn+1 , we lift the connection (we got mod pn ) (as in\n3.6.8 11)), not blindly but in such a way that the resulting coefficients aisl (n) are linear\ncombinations (with fixed coefficients of Rj /pRj ) of p-power elements of Qj,n /pQj,n ; after\nthis careful lift we start to modify \u03a6(Qj,n )i , i = 0, 1, by trying to achieve all aijl (n)'s to\nbe 0. Third (resp. fourth), we have Raynaud's (resp. Grothendieck's) theorem of [BBM,\n3.1.1] (resp. of [Il, 4.4]).\nSo the situation (after suitable modifications) should get stabilized: we expect (at\nleast if k is of some special type, i.e. \"almost\" algebraically closed in some sense which\nwe can not specify too much: just that it is related to the defs. of 3.6.18.4.6 F below)\nthe existence of m \u2208 N such that (after suitable modifications) we can take Qj,n = Qj,m\n\u2200n \u2208 N, n \u2265 m. From many points of view, it is preferable to have (if possible) aisl (n) = 0,\n\u2200n \u2208 N, n \u2265 m; so the problem of such a stabilization is a very important one. If such\na stabilization is possible, then we do not have to pass (mod p) to N-pro-\u00e9tale covers:\nthis is so due to the fact that Qj,n /pQj,n , n \u2265 m, is a connected component of the \u00e9tale\nscheme over Spec(Qj,m /pQj,m ) defined by the system (4) of equations of 3.6.8. This\ngives a very nice expression (fully controllable) of the resulting connections \u2207nj but the\ncontrol on \u03a6(Qj,n )0 and \u03a6(Qj,n )1 is much less; for instance, we can not regain the (sort\nof) completion property or (of) the slice principle.\nOnce we gained the completion property and the slice principle, the second approach\n(trying to avoid the use of N-pro-\u00e9tale morphisms), looks, from many points of view, more\nconvenient. In all concrete cases we analyzed (for instance, this is automatically so if we\nare in a context involving polarized abelian varieties, or which can be reduced to such\na context: see 4.12.12 and 4.12.12.0) the situation (after suitable modifications) gets\nstabilized. Warning: neither Grothendieck's nor Raynaud's theorems mentioned above\nare enough to imply such a stabilization, even for situations where we can assume that\n249\n\n\fall tensors (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J are related to (i.e. are defined by) endomorphisms of M . We will\ncome back to this in \u00a710.\n3.6.9. Remarks. 1) We could have worked 3.6.1 with U0 and U2 as open subschemes of Gder . This is the most common case needed for applications. For example, a\n\u03c3-crystal (M, tg2 \u03c60 ), with t \u2208 Z(G)(W (k)) and g2 \u2208 G(W (k)), is very much the same as\nthe \u03c3-crystal (M, g2 \u03c60 ); so we often (for instance when k = k\u0304 and p does not divide the\norder of the center of Gder ) can consider only elements g2 \u2208 Gder (W (k)).\n2) The assumption ii) of the beginning of 3.6 is not really needed: it has been\ninserted just to be able to be faster in 3.6.8 8) and 12) and so to give an alternative way\nin 3.6.8 7) which is not based on 3.6.8 1). Obviously, the property ii) of the beginning\nof 3.6, is implied by the property i) of the mentioned place, provided we replace U0 and\nU2 by suitable open, affine subschemes of them. This makes life easier (cf. 3.6.9.1 and\n3.6.10 below); in particular 3.6.11 below can be expressed in a simpler form, without\nmentioning U or b.\n3) Looking back to 3.6.1-8 we see that the only two places we used the fact that k\nis an infinite field are:\n\u0001\n\u2013 3.6.0, where we needed the existence of an element h \u2208 U0 \u2229 U2 (k), which as a\npoint of U0 (resp. of U2 ) is different from the point obtained by taking the special fibre\nof a0 (resp. of g2 );\n\u2013 3.6.6, where we needed L to be infinite.\nSo if we are not bothered about gluing things (\"over W (k)\") (cf. 3.6.5), we can work\nwith only one deformation, cf. 3.6.7. So, in this context of just one deformation, the\nwhole of 3.6.1 makes sense and remains true even in the case when k is a finite field.\n3.6.9.1. Potential-deformation sheets. Let k be a perfect field of characteristic\np > 2. A locally closed, affine subscheme U of a reductive group G\u0303 over W (k) (resp. an\naffine scheme U over W (k)), with U (W (k)) containing the identity element of G\u0303(W (k))\n(resp. such that a z \u2208 U (W (k)) is fixed), is said to be a potential-deformation reductive\nsheet (resp. just sheet), if there is an \u00e9tale morphism (resp. a formally \u00e9tale morphism)\nbU : U \u2192 Spec(W (k)[x1 , ..., xd(U) ]),\nfor some d(U ) \u2208 N, such that the identity element of G\u0303(W (k)) (resp. z) factors through\nthe closed subscheme of U defined by xi = 0, i \u2208 S(1, d(U )). If moreover, we have:\n\u2013 the closed subscheme of U defined by the identity element of G\u0303(W (k)) (resp.\ndefined by z) is the closed subscheme of U defined by xi = 0, i = 1, d, and\n\u2013 the closed subscheme of Uk defined by xi = 0, with i running through an arbitrary\nsubset of S(1, d(U )), is connected,\nthen we speak about a convenient potential-deformation reductive sheet (resp. just sheet).\nVery often we denote a potential-deformation reductive sheet (resp. just sheet) by a\npair (U, bU ) (resp. by a triple (U, bU , z)). For any potential-deformation sheet we denote\nby \u03a6U the Frobenius lift of U \u2227 which takes xi into xpi , \u2200i \u2208 S(1, d(U )).\n250\n\n\fThis definition of a (convenient) potential-deformation (reductive) sheet is suggested\nby 3.6.9 2) and the convenience assumption 3.6.1.1.3.\n3.6.10. Corollary. For any g3 \u2208 G(W (k)) and for every open, affine subscheme\nU3 = Spec(R3 ) of G which is a potential-deformation reductive sheet, there is a uniquely\ndetermined N-pro-\u00e9tale, affine morphism\nl4 : U4 = Spec(R4 ) \u2192 U3\nsuch that:\n\u2013 there is a closed subscheme of Gk not containing the origin of Gk , with the property\nthat the fibres of l4 above points of the special fibre of U3 not belonging to it, are nonempty;\n\u2013 the special fibre of U4 is a geometrically connected, AG k-scheme;\n\u2013 l\u22121\n4 (Zk ) = Spec(k) and so the origin of G, when viewed as a W (k)-valued point of\nU3 , can be lifted uniquely to a point a4 \u2208 U4 (W (k)) = U4\u2227 (W (k));\n\u2013 there is a p-divisible group D(U3 , \u03a6U3 , M, F 1 , g3 \u03c60 , G) over U4\u2227 , whose associated\n\u2207\np-divisible object of MF[0,1]\n(U4 ) (the Frobenius on U4\u2227 being the one induced from a fixed\nFrobenius lift \u03a6U3 of U3\u2227 as in 3.6.9.1), is isomorphic to\n\u0001\n(MR4 , \u22074 ) = M \u2297W (k) R4\u2227 , F 1 \u2297W (k) R4\u2227 , h4 (g3 \u03c60 \u2297 1), \u22074 ,\nwith h4 \u2208 G(R4\u2227 ) as the universal element of G defined by U4\u2227 and with \u22074 a connection\non M \u2297W (k) R4\u2227 respecting the G-action;\n\u2013 we have the following universal property:\nUP. For any formally \u00e9tale, affine morphism l\u03034 : \u01684 = Spec(R\u03034 ) \u2192 U3 , such that the\nclosed subscheme l\u0303\u22121\n4 (Zk ) has a non-empty intersection with all connected components of the special fibre of \u01684 and for which we get a p-divisible group D\u03034 over\n\u01684\u2227 , defining (by forgetting the connection of D(D\u03034 )) a p-divisible object NR\u03034 of\nMF[0,1] (R\u03034 ) isomorphic to MR\u03034 , there is a unique morphism l : Spec(R\u03034\u2227 ) \u2192\n\u2227\n\u2217\n1\nSpec(R4\u2227 ) such that l\u2227\n4 = l\u03034 \u25e6l and D\u03034 is isomorphic to l (D(U3 , \u03a6U3 , M, F , g3 \u03c60 , G))\nunder an isomorphism IS such that, by forgetting the connections, D(IS) is the mentioned isomorphism NR\u03034 \u2192M\n \u0303 R\u03034 .\nHere MR3 is defined as in 3.6.1.1: it allows us to get MR4 and MR\u03034 as in 3.6.1.1.\n3.6.11. Corollary. Let H\u0303 be a smooth subgroup of G having a connected special\nfibre. Let eH\u0303 := dimW (k) (H\u0303). Let UH\u0303 = Spec(R5 ) be an open, affine subscheme of H\u0303\nfor which there is an open subscheme U of G containing UH\u0303 such that there are \u00e9tale\nmorphisms b and c making the diagram\nUH\u0303\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\nyb\n\nSpec W (k)[z1 , . . . , zeH\u0303 ]\n\ni\n\nH\u0303\n\u2212\u2192\n\n\u0001\n\na\n\n\u2212\u2192\n251\n\nU\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6c\ny\n\nSpec W (k)[z1 , . . . , zd ]\n\n\u0001\n\n\fto be cartesian (with iH\u0303 as the natural inclusion, with a as the natural closed embedding\ndefined by: zi goes to zi , for i \u2208 S(1, eH\u0303 ), and to 0 otherwise) and the origin a0 factors\nthrough the closed subscheme of UH\u0303 defined by zi = 0, i = 1, eH\u0303 . Let the Frobenius lift\n\u03a6R5 of R5\u2227 be defined by: zi (viewed via c as an element of R5 ) goes to zip , i = 1, eH\u0303 .\nThen for any g\u0303 \u2208 G(W (k)), there is an N-pro-\u00e9tale, affine morphism\nl6 : U6 = Spec(R6 ) \u2192 UH\u0303 ,\nwith the special fibre of U6 a geometrically connected, AG k-scheme and with l\u22121\n6 (Zk ) =\nSpec(k) (so there is a unique a6 \u2208 U6\u2227 lifting the factorization of a0 through UH\u0303 ), such\nthat:\n\u2207\n\u2013 there is a p-divisible group over U6\u2227 whose associated p-divisible object of MF[0,1]\n(R6 )\nis isomorphic to\n\n\u0001\n(MR\u22276 , \u22076 ) = M \u2297W (k) R6\u2227 , F 1 \u2297W (k) R6\u2227 , h6 (g\u0303\u03c60 \u2297 1), \u22076 ,\nwith h6 as the universal element of H\u0303 defined by the p-adic completion of l6 ; \u22076 respects\nthe G-action;\n\u2013 we have a universal property similar to the one described at the end of 3.6.10;\n\u2013 there is a closed subscheme of B\u0303k not containing the origin of H\u0303k and such that\nthe fibres of l6 above points of the special fibre of UH\u0303 not belonging to it, are non-empty.\nThe results 3.6.10-11 are a direct consequence of 3.6.1.3 and its proof and of 3.6.9 2)\nand 3). We just need to mention two things (for instance in connection to 3.6.10). First,\nl is uniquely determined by requiring D(D\u03034 ) to be isomorphic to l\u2217 (M4 , \u22074 ). Second,\nR\u03034 /pR\u03034 has a finite p-basis, as R3 /pR3 does have, and so the passage from filtered F crystals to p-divisible groups is achieved via the fully faithfulness property of [BM, 4.1.1]\nand via Grothendieck\u2013Messing theory of [Me, ch. 4-5] (cf. also 3.6.2.0); the usage of this\nlast theory is part of the second place where we need p > 2.\n3.6.11.1. Notations. We denote by D(UH\u0303 , \u03a6R5 , M, F 1 , g\u0303\u03c60 , G) the p-divisible\ngroup over U6\u2227 mentioned in 3.6.11. For n \u2208 N, we denote by U6,n = Spec(Q\u2227\n6,n ) the\nscheme constructed as in 3.6.1.3 1), starting from the data of the sextuple\n(UH\u0303 , \u03a6R5 , M, F 1 , g\u0303\u03c60 , G).\n\u2227\nn\n\u2227\n\u2227\nWe use morphisms l6,n : Spec(Q\u2227\n6,n ) \u2192 Spec(R6 ), and l6 : Spec(Q6,n+1 ) \u2192 Spec(Q6,n ),\nhaving the same significance as in 3.6.1.3. We can take as U6 the limit of the N-projective\nsystem ln6 , n \u2208 N, and as l6 we can take the resulting W (k)-morphism U6 \u2192 UH\u0303 . Let\nQ6 be the W (k)-algebra such that U6\u2227 = Spec(Q6 ).\n\n3.6.12. Remark. We refer to 3.6.11. We can replace \"G-action\" by H\u0303 1 -action,\nwhere H\u0303 1 is the smallest smooth, connected subgroup of G containing H\u0303 and the image\nof \u03bc and whose Lie algebra is taken by pg\u0303\u03c60 into itself, cf. [Fa2, rm. ii) after th. 10] and\n252\n\n\fFact of 2.2.9 1). Moreover, it is enough to assume UH\u0303 is a locally closed subscheme of G\nthrough which a0 factors, having a geometrically connected special fibre and smooth over\nW (k), without assuming that it is the open subscheme of a smooth subgroup H\u0303 of Gder .\nHowever, in practice H\u0303 is either a subgroup containing Gder or is an abelian subgroup of\ne\nG isomorphic to GaH\u0303 ; in this last situation we can take UH\u0303 = H\u0303.\n3.6.13. The standard deformation setting in the context of a SHS. As\nexplained in 1.14.2, the reading of 3.6.13-14 should proceed only after the reading of 3.9\nand 3.11-12. We start moving towards geometric contexts.\nLet (f, L(p) , v) be a SHS defined by an injective map f : (G\u0303, X) \u0592\u2192 GSp(W, \u03c8), S).\nWe use the standard notation of 2.3.1-3 but with G replaced everywhere by G\u0303. Let k be\na perfect field of characteristic p and let\nz : Spec(W (k)) \u2192 NW (k) /H0 .\nLet (M, F 1 , g\u03c60 , G\u2032 , \u03c8\u0303M ) be its attached principally quasi-polarized (not necessarily\nquasi-split) quasi Shimura filtered \u03c3-crystal (cf. 2.3.10). Here G\u2032 is a form (not a priori\ninner) of G\u0303W (k) . For simplifying the presentation we assume G\u2032 = G\u0303W (k) ; so we do not\nhave to mention any more \"not necessarily quasi-split\". Let G be the subgroup of G\u2032 such\nthat under the last identification it is G\u03030W (k) (see 2.3.1 for the meaning of G\u03030Z(p) ). Here\ng \u2208 G(W (k)); strictly speaking \u03c60 is obtained from g\u03c60 , as in 3.2.3 (i.e. the Shimura adjoint filtered Lie \u03c3-crystal attached to (M, F 1 , \u03c60 , G\u0303W (k) ) is of Borel type). We use some\nof the previous notations of this 3.6, adjusted as need (the adjustments are mentioned\nat the right time). In particular we have a direct sum decomposition M = F 1 \u2295 F 0 and\na0 denotes the origin of G; in the case of this direct sum decomposition, the wording\n\"adjusted as needed\" refers to the fact that we are not bothered that it is associated to\na cocharacter \u03bc of G\u0303W (k) and not of G itself.\nLet U3 = Spec(R3 ) be an open, affine subscheme of G = G\u03030W (k) which is a\npotential-deformation\nreductive sheet. Let (MR4 , \u22074 ) = M \u2297W (k) R4\u2227 , F 1 \u2297W (k)\n\u0001\n\u2207\nR4\u2227 , h4 (g\u03c60 \u2297 1), \u22074 be the p-divisible object of MF[0,1]\n(R4 ) mentioned in 3.6.10 for\n\ng3 = g \u2208 G(W (k)). We use the notations of 3.6.10; strictly speaking (M, F 1 , g\u03c60 , G, \u03c8\u0303M )\nis not a principally quasi-polarized Shimura filtered \u03c3-crystal but it is \"close enough\" (cf.\n2.2.9 1) and 1'): we are in a pseudo context) to justify this usage (cf. 3.6.1.6 or 3.6.11).\nLet Az := Spec(W (k)) z \u00d7NW (k) /H0 AH0 . For similar reasons, we also assume the\nsubgroup H0 of G(Apf ) is \"small enough (w.r.t. z)\" so that the family of Hodge cycles\n(w\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J \u2032 with which the abelian variety Az \u00d7W (k) Spec(W (k\u0304)) over W (k\u0304) is naturally\nendowed (through any lift Spec(W (k\u0304)) \u2192 NW (k) of z), is defined over W (k) and so it\ngives birth to a family (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J \u2032 of de Rham components of the F 0 -filtration of T (M )\nand implicitly of the F 0 -filtration of T (M \u2297W (k) R4 ). To be more concrete, we assume\nH0 = H1 , where H1 is as in 2.3.11. This assumption is not really needed (cf. 3.6.14.2\nbelow); however, it allows us to avoid using the word \"quasi\".\nWe have: \u22074 (t\u03b1 ) = 0 (as \u22074 respects the G-action) and h4 (g\u03c60 \u2297 1)(t\u03b1 ) = t\u03b1 ,\n\u2200\u03b1 \u2208 J \u2032 . The fact that G fixes \u03c8\u0303M , implies that \u03c8\u0303M defines a principal quasi-polarization\n253\n\n\fof MR4 . Let\nM\u0303R4 := (MR4 , \u22074 , \u03c8\u0303M ).\n\u2207\nIt is a principally quasi-polarized p-divisible object of MF[0,1]\n(R4 ). Sometimes we prefer\n\u2032\nto regard it as being with tensors (they are t\u03b1 , \u03b1 \u2208 J ).\n\u2227\nWe denote by mnat the natural morphism (NW (k) /H0 ) \u2192 N /H0 .\nb = Spec(R\nc3 ) = Spec(R\nc4 ) be the completion of G in its origin (or the\nSA1. Let G\ncompletion of U4 in a4 ). From [Va2, 5.4.4] (see 2.3.11 or the proof of 2.3.15) we deduce\nb\nthe existence of a W (k)-morphism zG\nb : G \u2192 NW (k) /H0 such that the completion of\na4 is mapped into z and the two principally quasi-polarized Shimura p-divisible groups\nb obtained by pulling back the ones over NW (k) /H0 (see Fact 3 of 2.3.11) and over\nover G\nSpec(R4\u2227 ) (see 3.6.10) are isomorphic, through an isomorphism lifting the identity in (the\ncompletion of) a4 . Warning: we assume zG\nb mod p factors through the henselization of\nthe localization of Spec(R4 /pR4 ) in the k-valued point defined by a4 .\n\n3.6.14. Theorem (the deformation principle: the expanded form). There\nis an integral, affine scheme VG = Spec(SG ), which is the p-adic completion of an\nN-pro-\u00e9tale scheme over a smooth W (k)-scheme, and there are W (k)-morphisms a :\n\u2227\nSpec(W (k)) \u0592\u2192 VG , b : VG \u2192 (NW (k) /H0 ) and c : VG \u2192 U4\u2227 such that:\n\na) a4 = c \u25e6 a and the p-adic completion of z is b \u25e6 a;\nb) b is obtained by taking the p-adic completion of the composite of an N-pro-\u00e9tale\nmorphism with a smooth morphism while c is the p-adic completion of an N-pro\u00e9tale morphism;\nc) The special fibre of VG is geometrically connected and the image of c mod p contains\nan open, dense subscheme of the special fibre of U4\u2227 ;\nd) If NSG = (N, FS1G , \u03a6N , \u2207N , \u03c8\u0303N ) is the principally quasi-polarized p-divisible object\n\u2207\nof MF[0,1]\n(SG ) defined by the principally quasi-polarized p-divisible group of the principally polarized abelian scheme VG b0 \u00d7NW (k) /H0 (AH0 , PAH0 ) over VG , then there is an\nisomorphism of NSG into M\u0303SG (the pull back of M\u0303R4 through the W (k)-morphism c)\ntaking the de Rham component tS\u03b1G (of the Hodge cycle w\u03b1SG of VG b0 \u00d7N /H0 AH0 ; it is\nviewed as a tensor of N [ p1 ] and is obtained similarly to 2.3.12-13) into t\u03b1 , \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 J \u2032 (here\nb0 := mnat \u25e6 b).\nLet H\u0303 be the unipotent radical of the parabolic subgroup of G\u03030W (k) normalizing the\ndirect summand F 0 of M . Let UH\u0303 = Spec(R5 ) be an open, affine subscheme of H\u0303 such\nthat the conditions of 3.6.11 are satisfied. We use the notations of 3.6.11 and 3.6.11.1,\nwith g\u0303 = g. So eH\u0303 = dimC (X). Similarly to M\u0303R4 above, we define a principally quasi\u2207\npolarized p-divisible object (sometimes viewed of being with tensors) of MF[0,1]\n(R6 )\nM\u0303R6 := (MR6 , \u22076 , \u03c8\u0303M ).\nSA2. As in SA1 we now assume that the similarly defined W (k)-morphism from\nthe completion of UH\u0303 in the origin into NW (k) /H0 , when taken mod p, factors through\nthe henselization of the localization of Spec(Q6 /pQ6 ) in its k-valued point defined by a6 .\n254\n\n\fWe refer to this assumption (as well as of the one of SA1) as the starting assumption.\n3.6.14.1. Theorem (the deformation principle). There is an integral, affine\nscheme VH\u0303 = Spec(SH\u0303 ), which is the p-adic completion of an N-pro-\u00e9tale scheme over a\nsmooth W (k)-scheme, and there are W (k)-morphisms a : Spec(W (k)) \u0592\u2192 VH\u0303 , b : VH\u0303 \u2192\n\u2227\n(NW (k) /H0 ) and c : VH\u0303 \u2192 U6\u2227 such that:\na) a6 = c \u25e6 a and the p-adic completion of z is b \u25e6 a;\nb) b and c are p-adic completions of N-pro-\u00e9tale morphisms;\nc) The special fibre of VH\u0303 is geometrically connected and the image of c mod p contains\nan open, dense subscheme of the special fibre of U6\u2227 ;\nd) If NSH\u0303 = (N, FS1 , \u03a6N , \u2207N , \u03c8\u0303N ) is the principally quasi-polarized p-divisible object\nH\u0303\n\u2207\nof MF[0,1]\n(SH\u0303 ) defined by the principally quasi-polarized p-divisible group of the principally polarized abelian scheme VH\u0303 b0 \u00d7NW (k) /H0 (AH0 , PAH0 ) over VH\u0303 , then there is an\nisomorphism of NSH\u0303 into M\u0303SH\u0303 (the pull back of M\u0303R\u22276 through the W (k)-morphism c)\nS\n\nS\n\ntaking the de Rham component t\u03b1H\u0303 (of the Hodge cycle w\u03b1H\u0303 of VH\u0303 b0 \u00d7N /H0 AH0 ; it\nis viewed as a tensor of N [ p1 ] and is obtained as in 2.3.12-13) into t\u03b1 , \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 J \u2032 (here\nb0 := mnat \u25e6 b).\nProof: The proof of 3.6.14 is entirely similar to the proof of 3.6.14.1, just the\npresentation in the case of 3.6.14.1 is slightly more complicated. So we prove here only\n3.6.14.1. We do not hesitate (though this makes the proof longer) to take the necessary\ntime to explain in detail what the systems of equations of first type as defined in 3.6.8.9\n(can) bring new (besides 3.6.1.3) to the deformation theory of Shimura p-divisible groups.\nAlso, as mentioned in 1.14.2, we do not hesitate to refer to parts of 3.9 and 3.11-12. We\ncan assume dimC (X) > 0: if G\u0303 is a torus the above Theorems are trivial.\n1\nA.

Here xi 's are independent variables.\n\nC. Let H\u0303 0 be the completion of H\u0303 (or of UH\u0303 ) in its origin. From [Fa2, th. 10 and\nthe remarks after] (cf. D) and the proof of 2.3.15) we deduce the existence of a unique\nUH\u0303 -morphism\n0\nmH\u0303 : H\u0303 0 = Spec(SH\u0303\n) \u2192 Y16,\u221e ;\nY16,\u221e is naturally a Spec(Q6 )-scheme and so a UH\u0303 -scheme. We have a natural factorization fZ of hZ through mH\u0303 . The key point is:\n256\n\n\fE) We can assume the morphism mH\u0303 mod p factors through the Y16 -scheme \u1ef81 \u00d7Y16\nY16,\u221e , where the Y16 -scheme \u1ef81 is defined by l\u03036 of the following fibre product:\nc\u0303\n\n1\n\u1ef81 \u2212\u2192\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\nyl\u03036\n\nY1\u2227\n\nc\n\n1\n\u2212\u2192\n\nSpec(Q6 )\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6l\ny6\nUH\u0303 .\n\nD. E) is a consequence (in fact a restatement) of SA2. We stop to digress why\nthe statement of the starting assumption is not automatically satisfied. We first remark\nthat the composite of fZ with the morphism H\u0303 0 \u2192 \u1ef81 is a canonical closed embedding\naZ : Z \u0592\u2192 \u1ef81 (cf. D) and B). The completion of \u1ef81 w.r.t. the ideal defining this\nembedding, can be identified with H\u0303 0 (cf. B)). Let c\u030301 and l\u030306 be the natural W (k)morphisms (obtained through this identification) from H\u0303 0 to Spec(Q6 ) and respectively\n0\nto Y1\u2227 . Let m \u2208 N, m \u2265 2. Let I \u03030 := I0 SH\u0303\n. Referring to [Fa2, th. 10], when we have to\npass from things modulo I \u03030m to things modulo I \u03030m+1 , we do not know a priori that the\nk-morphism c\u030301 mod p is not changed. To argue this, let P be the parabolic subgroup of\nG normalizing F 1 ; so Lie(P ) = F 0 (Lie(G)). The obstruction of lifting things modulo I \u03030m\nto things modulo I \u03030m+1 , is given by some element\n\u03b3m \u2208 pLie(G) \u2297W (k) I \u03030m /I \u03030m+1\n(cf. C') and D) for m = 2). We can modify (as in loc. cit.) c\u030301 by something which is 0\nmod p so that we have \u03b3m \u2208 F 0 (Lie(G)) \u2297W (k) I \u03030m /I \u03030m+1 . But this element corresponds\n0\n(as in loc. cit.) to a replacement of a Frobenius endomorphism \u03a60H\u0303 of M \u2297W (k) SH\u0303\n(defined for instance via D1 ) by another one (1 \u2212 \u03b3m )\u03a60H\u0303 (1 \u2212 \u03b3m )\u22121 isomorphic to it. The\nnew obstruction we get is given by some new element\n\u03b3m+1 \u2208 Lie(G) \u2297W (k) I \u03030m+1 /I \u03030m+2 .\nBut \u03b3m+1 is not a priori divisible by p (however: if \u03b3m is divisible by p2 , then \u03b3m+1 is\ndivisible by p). So the induction does not apply. That is why we need SA2.\nE. Let now n \u2208 N. The principally quasi-polarized, finite, flat, commutative group\nscheme we naturally have over Spec(Q\u2227\n6,n+1 ) (see 3.6.2) is defined over the spectrum\n\u2227\nof a Q6,n+1 -subalgebra Q\u03036,n+1 of Q6,n+1 of finite type. So Y16,n+1 is obtained from a\nscheme Y16,n+1,al of finite type over Y1 \u00d7W (k) Spec(Q\u03036,n+1 ) by pull back through the\nnatural W (k)-morphism Spec(Q6 ) \u2192 Spec(Q\u03036,n+1 ). From [BLR, th. 12 of p. 83] we\ndeduce that the resulting W (k)-morphism H\u0303 0 \u2192 Y16,n+1,al factors through a smooth,\naffine Spec(Q6,n+1 )-scheme W16,n+1 (the fact that W (k) is an excellent DVR and U3\nis a potential deformation reductive sheet implies that all hypotheses of loc. cit. are\nsatisfied).\n257\n\n\fThere is an affine Y16,n -scheme Z16,n which (via the natural projection Spec(Y16,n ) \u2192\nSpec(Q6 )) is smooth over Spec(Q6 ): for instance we can take Z16,n to be the pull back\nto Spec(Q6 ) of the Spec(Q\u2227\n6,n+1 )-scheme\n1\nZ16,n\n:= Spec(Q\u2227\n6,n+1 ) \u00d7Spec(Q6,n+1 ) W16,n+1 ;\n1\nas Z16,n\nmod pn+1 is the same as W16,n+1 mod pn+1 , we have a natural W (k)-morphism\nZ16,n \u2192 Y16,n (cf. 2.2.1.1 2) and Fact 2 of 2.2.1.0).\nFrom this and D), using a slice, we get an affine W (k)-morphism\n\nt(n) : Spec(Tn ) \u2192 Y16,n\nsuch that, when composed with the projections of Y16,n on Y1 and respectively on\nSpec(Q6 ), it gives birth to a formally \u00e9tale, affine morphism q(n) and respectively to\nan \u00e9tale, affine morphism s(n) (the fact that q(n) mod p is formally \u00e9tale can be also\nchecked using arguments on Kodaira\u2013Spencer maps). Moreover we can assume that the\ninduced (by hZ ) W (k)-morphism Z \u2192 Y16,n factors through t(n), producing an affine\nW (k)-morphism\nhn : Z \u2192 Spec(Tn ),\nand that (cf. E)) t(n) mod p factors through \u1ef81 \u00d7Y16 Y16,n ; so the special fibre of the\nW (k)-morphism H\u0303 0 \u2192 Y16,n defined by mH\u0303 factors through the special fibre of t(n).\nAlso we can assume Spec(Tn /pTn ) is a geometrically connected k-scheme of finite type.\nBy induction on n \u2208 N we check that we can choose the things in such a way that\nthere is an \u00e9tale morphism\ntn : Spec(Tn+1 ) \u2192 Spec(Tn )\nfor which we have:\nF) s(n + 1) = s(n) \u25e6 tn , tn+1 \u25e6 hn+1 = hn and tn \u25e6 t(n + 1) \u2261 t(n) \u25e6 tn mod pn+1 .\nF. Proof of F): the ordinary case. The proof of F) is related to the following\nstatement: for suitable m \u2208 N \u222a {0}, we can not have two formally \u00e9tale morphisms from\nSpec(Tn+m ) into Y 1 which are different mod pn but identical mod p, whose images mod\np contain an open subset U 1 of the special fibre of Y 1 and are such that the pull backs\nof AY1 [pn+m ] and of its principal quasi-polarization through them are the same (i.e. are\nisomorphic). We refer to this statement as the statement (n, m).\nThe idea is: it is enough to check a statement (n, m) at G\u0303W (k) -ordinary points of U 1\n(due to the fact that Spec(Tn /pTn ) is connected), by using (good) G\u0303W (k) -multiplicative\ncoordinates; here G\u0303W (k) -ordinary points of U 1 are in the sense of 3.9.3.1 below. As the\ntheory of such coordinates is developed just in 4.1-4 and 4.7 below, we have to work\naround. Such a theory of ordinary points and canonical coordinates is already available\n(cf. [De3] and [No1]) for the particular case in which the Shimura-ordinary type associated\n258\n\n\fto N (see 4.1) is an ordinary type. So we first prove \u2013based on [Ka3, ch. 2]\u2013 statement\n(n, n) and F) for the particular case in which we assume the existence of a dense set of\nordinary points of Nk(v) .\nWe can assume s(n + 1) = s(n) \u25e6 tn and tn+1 \u25e6 hn+1 = hn . For the congruence\nmod pn of tn \u25e6 t(n + 1) and t(n) \u25e6 tn , it is enough to check that q(n + 1) is congruent to\nq(n) \u25e6 tn mod pn . So we start checking that q(n) \u25e6 tn+1 is congruent to q(n + 1) modulo\npm(n) for a sufficiently large m(n) \u2208 N. From [Ka3, p. 151] we deduce that, at the ring\nlevels, q(n) \u25e6 tn is congruent to q(n + 1) modulo the [ n+1\n2 ]-power of any maximal ideal\nof Tn corresponding to an ordinary point Spec(Tn )(k\u0304) (with the notations of loc. cit.,\nif x \u2208 A(k)[pn ], then p2n x\u0303 = 0). But the ordinary points of Spec(Tn /pTn ) are dense\n(cf. our density assumption and the fact that ordinary points can be recognized working\nmod p). So we can take m(n) = [ n+1\n]. This takes care of the statement (n, n). After a\n2\nrelabeling (like T2n becomes Tn ), we get F). This ends the proof of F) in the mentioned\nparticular (ordinary) case.\nG. We come back to the general case and assume (for the time being) that property\nF) holds. Let Spec(T\u221e ) be the limit of the N-projective system defined by tn , n \u2208 N.\nFrom F), we deduce the existence of a W (k)-morphism\n\u2227\nSpec(T\u221e\n) \u2192 Y16,\u221e\n\u2227\nsuch that hZ factors through it. Moreover, Spec(T\u221e\n) together with the W (k)-morphism\n\u2227\n\u2227\nSpec(W (k)) \u2192 Spec(T\u221e ) defined via hZ and the logical W (k)-morphisms Spec(T\u221e\n)\u2192\n\u2227\n\u2227\n\u2227\nU6 and Spec(T\u221e ) \u2192 (NW (k) /H0 ) , satisfies all requirements of 3.6.14.1, except of c).\nSo to get 3.6.14.1 c), we have to work in a more refined way: we have to show that\nSpec(T\u221e /pT\u221e ) can be obtained from Spec(T1 /pT1 ) using systems of equations \"closed\nin spirit\" to those of first type, in the same manner as in the proof of the last part of\n3.6.8.1.2 a); on the way of achieving this we also prove F) in the general case. The needed\nrefinement is present in H to K below.\n\nH. Proof of F): the general case. We work in the general case. We reached\nthe situation: over Spec(T1 ) there are two principally quasi-polarized Shimura p-divisible\ngroups such that their kernels under the multiplication by p are isomorphic; as Spec(T1 )\nis a regular, formally smooth W (k)-scheme it makes sense to speak about an isomorphism\npreserving the tensors: by this we mean a filtered isomorphism between filtered, projective\nT1\u2227 -modules underlying the filtered F -crystals of these two p-divisible groups, preserving\nthe quasi-polarizations and (in the sense of 1J \u2032 -isomorphisms) the tensors, and which mod\np results in an isomorphism I1 between truncations mod p of principally quasi-polarized\n\u2207\np-divisible objects of MF[0,1]\n(T1 ). We have:\nG) There is a formally \u00e9tale, p-adically complete, affine Spec(T1 )-scheme Z\u0303\u221e through\nwhich the W (k)-morphism h1 factors, such that over the special fibre \u1ef8\u221e of Z\u0303\u221e , the\ntwo principally quasi-polarized p-divisible groups we got naturally over Spec(T1 /pT1 ),\nare isomorphic, under an isomorphism which, when viewed (by forgetting the filtrations) as an isomorphism between p-divisible objects of M\u2207\n[0,1] (Z\u0303\u221e ), lifts the exten259\n\n\fsion of I1 to Z\u0303\u221e , preserves the tensors and in the Z-valued point defined by the\nfactorization of h1 , is the one defined naturally via hZ .\nThis is a consequence of F). As we proved property F) only in the ordinary case,\nwe need to point out that G) is also a consequence of SA2. To see this we just need to\nremark that SA2 implies directly:\nFact. Let n \u2208 N. The integral closed subscheme of the Spec(T1 /pT1 )-scheme parameterizing isomorphisms between the kernels of the multiplication by pn of the two\nprincipally quasi-polarized p-divisible groups we got over Spec(T1 /pT1 ), through which\nthe composite morphism of m\u0303H mod p and of the natural k-morphism Y16,\u221e k \u2192 Y16,1 k\nfactors naturally, is generically finite over Spec(T1 /pT1 ) and so \u00e9tale over Spec(T1 /pT1 )\nin its k-valued point obtained from the one of H\u0303 0 , via this factorization.\nIt is worth pointing out that the generically finiteness part of this Fact results also\nfrom the following obvious Subfact (which is a particular case of b) of 2.2.4 B):\nSubfact. Let k1 \u2282 k2 be two algebraically closed fields containing k. We consider\nisomorphisms over W (k2 ) between truncations mod pn of two Shimura p-divisible groups\nD\u0303(1) = (D(1), (t(1)\u03b1)\u03b1\u2208J ) and D\u0303(2) = (D(2), (t(2)\u03b1)\u03b1\u2208J ) over W (k1 ), preserving the\ntensors, in the sense that they lift to 1J \u2032 -isomorphisms (as in 2.2.9 6)) between D\u0303(1) and\nD\u0303(2). Then the number of such isomorphisms is finite and all of them are defined over\nW (k1 ).\nWe come back to the proof of F). We now show that G) implies F). From the\nFact we deduce that we can assume Z\u0303\u221e is the p-adic completion of an affine, N-pro\u00e9tale Spec(T1 )-scheme. We write Z\u0303\u221e = Spec(T\u0303\u221e ). From G) we deduce the existence\nof a natural morphism mfil\nk : Z\u0303\u221ek \u2192 Y16,\u221e . We consider the underlying T\u0303\u221e -module\nM\u0303\u221e of the F -crystal over Z\u0303\u221ek associated to the p-divisible group over Z\u0303\u221ek (defined\nby the pull back of any of the two p-divisible groups over Spec(T1 /pT1 )). The two F 1 filtrations F11 (M\u0303\u221e ) and F21 (M\u0303\u221e ) of M\u0303\u221e defined respectively via D1 and D2 , might not\nbe the same. We consider the principally polarized abelian scheme P P A over Z\u0303\u221e we\nget from (AY1 , pAY1 ) via natural pull backs. The \"replacement\" of F11 (M\u0303\u221e ) by F21 (M\u0303\u221e ),\ncorresponds to a \"replacement\" of P P A by another principally polarized abelian scheme\nP P A\u2032 over Z\u0303\u221e , which still lifts the special fibre of P P A, cf. Serre\u2013Tate's deformation\ntheory (this is part of the second place where we need p > 2). The pull backs (via h1 ) of\nP P A and P P A\u2032 to Spec(W (k)) are the same.\nClaim. Passing to an \u00e9tale cover of Z\u0303\u221e through which h1 still factors, P P A\u2032 becomes isomorphic (under an isomorphism which in h1 is the identity) to the pull back\nof (AH0 , PAH0 ) through a uniquely determined O(v) -morphism mfil\n1 : Z\u0303\u221e \u2192 N /H0 lifting\nfil\nthe k(v)-morphism Z\u0303\u221ek \u2192 Nk(v) /H0 naturally defined by mk .\nThe existence of mfil\n1 , with Z\u0303\u221e being replaced by its completion in its k-valued\npoint naturally defined by the factorization of h1 , is a consequence of 2.2.21 UP (cf.\nFact 4 of 2.3.11). By passing to an \u00e9tale cover of Z\u0303\u221e defined by replacing H0 by a\ncompact, open, normal subgroup of it such that (AH0 , PAH0 ) is the natural pull back\n260\n\n\fof the universal principally polarized abelian scheme over M/K p (N ) (for notations cf.\n2.3.3), the existence of mfil\n1 becomes a statement in the faithfully flat topology and so\nit is a consequence of variants of the deformation theory of [Va2, 5.4.4-6] mentioned in\n2.3.11. By combining the last two sentences, the Claim follows.\nWe conclude: mfil\n1 defines naturally a W (k)-morphism\nmfil : Z\u0303\u221e \u2192 Y16,\u221e\nthrough which hZ factors and whose special fibre is mfil\nk . As Z\u0303\u221e is the p-adic completion\nof an affine, N-pro-\u00e9tale Spec(T1 )-scheme, we have a version of mfil mod pn+1 in which\nY16,\u221e is replaced by Y16,n and Z\u0303\u221e is replaced by an \u00e9tale Spec(T1 )-scheme (again cf.\n2.2.1.1 2) and Fact 2 of 2.2.1.0). This ends the proof of F) in the general case.\nI. To explain in detail this property G), we need some notations. Let \u03a62 be the\nFrobenius endomorphism of M \u2297W (k) T1\u2227 induced from the Frobenius endomorphism of\nM \u2297W (k) Q6 and let \u03a61 be the Frobenius endomorphism of M \u2297W (k) T1\u2227 defined via C)\nand the pull back of the natural p-divisible group on Y1 through q(1). For computing \u03a61\nand \u03a62 , we choose (for instance) the Frobenius lift \u03a6T1 of T1\u2227 to be the one induced from\nthe one of Q6 . Let Spec(T1h ) be the henselization of the localization of Spec(T1 ) w.r.t.\nthe k-valued point defined naturally by h1 .\nWe can assume the isomorphism I1 (see H) is defined by 1M \u2297W (k) T1 /pT1 . Property\nG) is equivalent to: there is h\u0303\u221e \u2208 G(T1h\u2227 ) such that mod p is the identity and over T1h\u2227\nwe have:\n(17)\n\nh\u0303\u221e \u25e6 (\u03a61 \u2297 1) = (\u03a62 \u2297 1) \u25e6 h\u0303\u221e .\n\nWorking as in 3.6.1.3, modulo powers of p, starting from equation (17) we construct an\nN-pro-\u00e9tale scheme over Spec(T1 /pT1 ) as follows. We start working mod p2 . So we are\ntrying to find an element h\u03031 \u2208 G(T1\u2227 ) which mod p is the identity and for which we have:\n(18)\n\n\u03a62 \u25e6 h\u03031 (m/p) \u2261 h\u03031 \u25e6 \u03a61 (m/p) mod p2 ,\n\nfor m \u2208 F 1 , and\n(19)\n\n\u03a62 \u25e6 h\u03031 (m) \u2261 h\u03031 \u25e6 \u03a61 (m) mod p2 ,\n\nif m \u2208 F 0 . The above congruencies are between elements of M \u2297W (k) T1\u2227 .\nFor solving the system of equations defined by (18) and (19), only the expression of\nh\u03031 mod p3 is important. Moreover as we already know the existence of I1 , we can assume\nh\u03031 mod p2 defines an element of P (T1 /pT1 ). So let \u03b3h\u03031 \u2208 Lie(P ) \u2297W (k) T1 /pT1 be such\nthat h\u03031 mod p2 is 1M \u2297W (k) T1 /p2 T1 + p\u03b3h\u03031 (warning: here p\u03b3h\u03031 \u2208 pLie(P ) \u2297W (k) T1 /pT1 =\nLie(P )\u2297W (k) pT1 /p2 T1 ). We choose arbitrarily a W (k)-basis {\u1ebd1 , ..., \u1ebddimW (k) (P ) } of Lie(P )\n261\n\n\fand a W (k)-basis {n1 , ..., neH\u0303 } of Lie(H\u0303). We can assume {\u1ebd1 , ..., \u1ebdeH\u0303 } is a W (k)-basis\nof F 1 (Lie(G)). We write\ndimW (k) (P )\nX\nxi \u1ebdi ,\n\u03b3h\u03031 =\ni=1\n\nwith xi as variables (thought as elements of T1 /pT1 ). Moreover we can write h\u03031 mod p3\nas follows\neH\u0303\nX\n2\n1M \u2297W (k) T1 /p3 T1 + p\u03b3\u0303h\u03031 + p\nyj nj ,\nj=1\n\nwith yj as extra variables (thought as elements of T1 /pT1 ) and with 1M \u2297W (k) T1 /p3 T1 +\np\u03b3\u0303h\u03031 \u2208 P (T1 /p3 T1 ) which mod p2 is 1M \u2297W (k) T1 /p2 T1 + p\u03b3h\u03031 . The above equations (18)\nand (19) get translated in a system of equations involving xi 's and yj 's. It defines an\naffine Spec(T1 /pT1 )-scheme Spec(T1\u2032 ). Usually it is not reduced; below we are interested\njust in the reduced scheme it defines.\nJ. 3.9.3.1 allows us to speak about G\u0303W (k) -ordinary points of Spec(T1 /pT1 ); their\ndefinition does not depend on which of the two p-divisible groups over Spec(T1 ) (i.e. on\nwhich of the morphisms q(1) and s(1)) we use to define them (cf. the existence of t(1)).\nFrom 3.12.1 (applied either in the context of 2.3.11 or in the abstract context of the pull\nback of (D(UH\u0303 , \u03a6R5 , M, F 1 , g\u03c60 , G), \u03c8\u0303M ) to H\u0303 0 ) we get that they are dense. We have:\nH) Spec(T1\u2032 ) has finite fibres over G\u0303W (k) -ordinary points of Spec(T1 /pT1 ) with values in\nk\u0304, having the same number of points which is a non-negative, integral power of p.\nWe get this by looking at the system of equations SEinit in xi 's and yj 's we got in\nthe following standard manner:\n\u2013 the right (resp. left) hand sides of (18) and (19) when combined, can be viewed\nas a product h\u03031 g1 (resp. h\u03032 g1 ) mod p2 , where g1 is the \u03a6T1 -linear endomorphism of\nM \u2297W (k) T1\u2227 defined by the formula \u03a61 = g1 \u03bc( p1 ), with \u03bc is as in 3.6.13, and where\nh\u03032 \u2208 G(T1\u2227 ) is congruent to the identity mod p;\n\u0001\n\u0001\nPeH\u0303\nPdimW (k) (P )\nxi (2)\u1ebdi + p\n\u2013 considering a sum 1M \u2297W (k) T1\u2227 + p\ni=1\nj=1 yj (2)nj which\nmod p2 is h\u03032 .\nSo, by computing xi (2)'s and yj (2)'s (in terms of Frobenius transforms of xi 's and\nyj 's) and by identifying the coefficients of \u1ebdi 's and nj 's, SEinit is obtained by combining\nthe equations of (20) and (21) below\n(20)\n\nxi = Li (xpe\n\nH\u0303 +1\n\n, ..., xpdimW (k) (P ) , y1p , ..., yepH\u0303 ),\n\ni \u2208 S(1, dimW (k) (P )), and\n(21)\n\nLi (xpe\n\nH\u0303 +1\n\n, ..., xpdimW (k) (P ) , y1p , ..., yepH\u0303 ) = 0,\n262\n\n\fi \u2208 S(dimW (k) (P ) + 1, dimW (k) (G)); warning: it is not of third type. Here Li is a nonhomogeneous linear form with coefficients in T1 /pT1 , i \u2208 S(1, dimW (k) (G)). A system of\nequations with coefficients in an Fp -algebra having the same form as (20) and (21), is\ncalled of fourth type.\nThe first eH\u0303 equations of (20) allow us to eliminate the variables x1 ,..., xeH\u0303 . So, over\nthe perfection Spec(T1 /pT1 )perf (of Spec(T1 /pT1 )), the last dimW (k) (P ) \u2212 eH\u0303 equations\nof (20) together with the p-th roots of the equations of (21), define a system of equations\nSE in dimW (k) (G) \u2212 eH\u0303 variables, which is very close in spirit to one of first type.\nIn fact, in any G\u0303W (k\u0304) -ordinary point of Spec(T1 /pT1 ) with values in k\u0304 (it defines\nuniquely a k\u0304-valued point of Spec(T1 /pT1 )perf ), SE becomes a system of equations with\ncoefficients in k\u0304 which is reduced-equivalent to one of first type. Here reduced-equivalent\nmeans that the reduced schemes of their affine k\u0304-schemes of solutions are the same\n(i.e. are isomorphic). To see this let (M \u2297W (k) W (k\u0304), g(yG )(\u03c60 \u2297 1), G\u0303W (k\u0304) ) be the\nShimura \u03c3\u0304-crystal of the pull back of D2 through a G\u0303W (k\u0304) -ordinary point yG : Spec(k\u0304) \u2192\nSpec(T1 /pT1 ). We consider the \u03a6T1 -Teichm\u00fcller lift zG : Spec(W (k\u0304)) \u2192 Spec(T1\u2227 ) of yG .\nThe proof of 3.11.1 c) below shows that there is h\u03033 \u2208 G(W (k)) congruent to the identity\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\nmod p and such that h\u03033 zG\n(\u03a61 \u2297 1) = zG\n(\u03a62 \u2297 1)h\u03033 . As the replacement of zG\n(h\u03031 ) by\n\u2217\nzG (h\u03031 )h\u03033 corresponds to a change of the extension to W (k\u0304) of the chosen W (k)-basis of\nLie(P ) and of Lie(H\u0303), we can assume we are dealing with W (k\u0304)-bases of PW (k\u0304) and of\nH\u0303W (k\u0304) such that the W (k\u0304)-submodules they generate are permuted by pg(yG )(\u03c60 \u2297 1) as\n\u2217\n(SE) is equivalent to a system of equations (in ui 's) with\nin 3.4.3.0. So we get that yG\ncoefficients in k\u0304 of the form\nai ui = up\u03c0(i) ,\ni = eH\u0303 + 1, dimW (k) (P ) + eH\u0303 ; we have: ai = 0 iff i \u2265 1+dimW (k) (P ). Here \u03c0 is a suitable\npermutation of the set S(1, dimW (k) (P ) + eH\u0303 ). Obviously, it is reduced-equivalent to one\nof first type. So the part of H) pertaining to a power of p (resp. to the same number of\npoints) follows from 3.1.8.1 (resp. from 3.11.1 c)).\nK. G) guarantees that Spec(T1\u2032 ) is not an empty scheme and that h1 mod p factors through the normalization Spec(T10\u2032 ) of the integral, closed subscheme of Spec(T1\u2032 )\nthrough which the special fibre of Z\u0303\u221e factors naturally. So Spec(T10\u2032 ) is a geometrically connected Spec(T1 /pT1 )-scheme. Moreover, it is an \u00e9tale cover over an open, dense\nsubscheme U1 of the G\u0303W (k) -ordinary locus L1 of Spec(T1 /pT1 ).\nThe same argument as the one used in the proof 3.6.8.1.2 a) applies to give us that\nwe can choose U1 to depend only on the coefficients of the homogeneous parts of the forms\nLi , i = 1, dimW (k) (G). We state this explicitly as a Lemma; its notations are independent\nof the previous ones and its proof (just an application of 3.6.8.9.0 and 3.6.8.1.2 a)) is left\nas an exercise.\nLemma. Let m, n \u2208 N, with m \u2264 n. We consider a system of equations of fourth\ntype\n\nui = Li (up1 , ..., upn),\n263\n\n\fi = 1, m and\n\n0 = Li (up1 , ..., upn),\n\ni = m + 1, n, with coefficients in an integral Fp -algebra R. We assume that its affine\nSpec(R)-scheme of solutions has finite non-empty fibres.\nThen there is an open, dense subscheme U of Spec(R) such that for any affine, dominant, integral Spec(R)-scheme Spec(R1 ) and for every n-tuple (c1 , ..., cn) of elements of\nR1 such that the affine Spec(R1 )-scheme Spec(R2 ) of solutions of the system of equations\nobtained by replacing above the linear form Li by Li + ci , \u2200i \u2208 S(1, n), has generically a\nfinite number of points, Spec(R2 ) \u00d7Spec(R) U is a finite scheme over Spec(R1 ) \u00d7Spec(R) U .\nSo we can repeat the arguments, for things modulo pn (n \u2208 N, n > 1). We obtain\nnew systems of equations, involving similar linear forms Li (n); moreover the homogeneous\npart of Li (n) is the same as of Li , \u2200i \u2208 S(1, dimW (k) (G)) and \u2200n \u2208 N \\ {1}.\nSo, entirely similar to 3.6.8.1.2 a), we deduce that we can assume \u1ef8\u221e is an affine\nSpec(T1 /pT1 )-scheme which is a non-trivial N-pro-\u00e9tale cover above U1 . In other words,\ncoming back to the paragraph G, we can assume the morphism Spec(T\u221e /pT\u221e ) \u2192\nSpec(Q6 /pQ6 ) has an image which contains an open subscheme of Spec(Q6 /pQ6 ). This\ntakes care of 3.6.14.1 c), ending the proof of 3.6.14.1.\n3.6.14.2. Exercise. Show that 3.6.14 and 3.6.14.1 remain true, as mentioned in\n3.6.13, without the assumptions made in 3.6.13. Hint: the only difference is that we have\nto work with different de Rham tensors, which become linear combination of de Rham\ncomponents of Hodge cycles, after passage to an \u00e9tale morphism.\n3.6.14.3. Exercise. Restate 3.6.14.1 and 3.6.14.1 in terms of a k-valued point y of\nNW (k) /H0 , instead of a W (k)-valued point z of NW (k) /H0 .\n3.6.14.4. Variants. We do not know when the starting assumptions SA1-2 are\nsatisfied. Instead of open subschemes of G = G0W (k) or of H\u0303, we can work with \u00e9tale\nschemes over them; so the chances of being able to verify such starting assumptions, in\nnew contexts which can be still of great use, are much higher. When there are no hopes\nto get any useful starting condition, in 3.6.14 d) and 3.6.14.1 d) we have to work with\ntruncations mod pn of p-divisible objects involved (n \u2208 N); in such a situation we do\nnot need to pass to N-pro-\u00e8tale morphisms. There are three variants of working with\ntruncations mod pn : below we detail them in the context of 3.6.14.1 (so that we can\nuse the notations of the proof of 3.6.14.1). Warning: for below variants, no starting\nassumption is needed.\nIn the first variant we entirely ignore the extra Shimura structure and keep track\njust of principally quasi-polarized, finite, flat, commutative group schemes; it stops at\nthe existence of the W (k)-morphism t(n) of 3.6.14.1 E.\nIn the second variant we essentially ignore the tensors but we keep track of the\nextra Shimura (Lie) structures. Let \u1ef816,n = Spec(R\u030316,n) be the integral, closed, affine\nsubscheme of Y16,n through which the composite of mH\u0303 with the natural W (k)-morphism\nY16,\u221e \u2192 Y16,n factors. \u1ef816,n might not be formally smooth over W (k). However, it is\n264\n\n\f1\n\u2227\nfaithfully flat over Zp and so we can still speak about Hj1 := Hcrys\n(Dj \u1ef816,n /\u1ef816,n\n) and so\n\nabout the R\u030316,n -submodule gj of End(Hj1 /pn Hj1 ) obtained naturally by pulling back the\nLie submodule of the kernel of the multiplication by pn of D1 , j = 1, 2. We have a natural\nidentification of H11 mod pn with H21 mod pn and so of their End's; these identifications\npreserve the filtrations. We consider the maximal closed subscheme Z\u030316,n of \u1ef816,nWn (k)\nwith the property that under this identification of End's, g1 mod pn is g2 mod pn ; as g2\nand End(H21 )/pn End(H21 ) are free R\u030316,n /pn R\u030316,n -modules, its construction is obvious.\nUsing n times [BLR, th. 12 of p. 83] we deduce, cf. the existence of mH\u0303 , that we can\nassume t(n) factors through \u1ef816,n in such a way that mod pn it factors through Z\u030316,n :\nfirst time, we achieve this factorization mod p, then mod p2 , etc. (as in 3.6.14.1 E we\ncan \"put\" everything in a finite type context). We conclude (cf. 2.2.20.1 9)):\nFact. We can assume that over Spec(Tn ), the crystalline counterparts of the kernel\nof the multiplication by pn of (D1 , PD1 ) and of (D2 , PD2 ) become isomorphic.\nIn the third variant we fully keep track of the tensors: it is easy to state the above\nsecond variant in a way that keeps full track of the tensors, provided we either assume\nt\u03b1 \u2208 T (M ), \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 J , or we treat the tensors as in 2.2.14 (we just have to define Z\u030316,n in\na way that keeps track of these tensors as well).\n3.6.14.4.1. It seems to us possible to prove directly, using (at least in the case\n(G, X) is of compact type) just the techniques of 3.6.14, the following expected result.\nExpectation. We assume k = k\u0304. Let n \u2208 N. There is a W (k)-valued point of\nNW (k) /H0 whose special fibre factors through the same connected component of Nk as y,\nsuch that the crystalline counterpart (see 2.2.20.1 9)) of the kernel of the multiplication\nby pn of the Shimura p-divisible group we get over W (k) through it, is isomorphic to the\ncrystalline counterpart of the same type of kernel of the Shimura p-divisible group we get\nthrough an arbitrary W (k)-valued point of Spec(Q6 ).\n3.6.15. The completion property. For the sake of presenting most of the twelve\nfundamental principles (of 1.2.3) in a reasonable compact form, we now include the\nfollowing expected result. We continue to refer to the context of 3.6.13 and to assume\nk = k\u0304. Let y : Spec(k) \u2192 NW (k) /H0 be defined by z.\nA. Expectation (the completion property). Giving g1 \u2208 G\u03030W (k) (W (k)), there\nis a point z1 : Spec(W (k)) \u2192 NW (k) /H0 lifting a k-valued point of the same connected component C 0 of Nk /H0 through which y factors and such that its attached prin\u0001\ncipally quasi-polarized Shimura filtered \u03c3-crystal M1 , F11 , \u03c61 , G\u0303W (k) , (t1\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J \u2032 , \u03c8\u0303M1 is\n\u0001\n1J \u2032 -isomorphic to M, F 1 , g1 \u03c60 , G\u0303W (k) , (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J \u2032 , \u03c8\u0303M .\nThis Expectation is proved in \u00a711; see also 4.12 below. The initial motivation for\nthis expectation is based on 3.6.14.4.1 and on the following Fundamental Lemma.\n\nB. Fundamental Lemma. Let (M, \u03c6, G) (resp. (M, \u03c6, G, pM )) be an arbitrary\n\u03c3-S-crystal over k (resp. an arbitrary \u03c3-S-crystal over k endowed with a perfect bilinear\n265\n\n\fform pM : (M, \u03c6) \u2297W (k) (M, \u03c6) \u2192 W (k)(n(\u03c6)) normalized by G and for which the W condition holds; here n(\u03c6) \u2208 Z). Then there is n \u2208 N, such that for any hn \u2208 G(W (k))\ncongruent to the identity mod pn (resp. congruent to the identity mod pn and centralizing pM ), (M, hn \u03c6, G) (resp. (M, hn \u03c6, G, pM )) is isomorphic to (M, \u03c6, G) (resp. to\n(M, hn \u03c6, G, pM )) under an isomorphism defined by an element of G(W (k)).\nProof: We can assume v := dimB(k) (Lie(GB(k) )) is at least 1. We first deal with the\ncontext without pM . Let sL (\u03c6) \u2208 N \u222a {0} be the smallest number such that psL (\u03c6) \u03c6 takes\nLie(G) onto itself. Using Dieudonn\u00e9's classification of isocrystals over k for the isocrystal\n(Lie(GB(k) ), \u03c6), we consider a B(k)-basis\nB = {e1 , ..., ev }\nof Lie(GB(k) ) formed by elements of Lie(G) such that there is a permutation \u03c0L of S(1, v)\nwith the property that it can be decomposed into a product of disjoint cycles C1 ,..., Cs ,\nwith s \u2208 N, each such cycle Ci0 = (a1 , ..., aq ), with i0 \u2208 S(1, s), having the property that\n\u03c6(eaj ) = eaj+1 if j \u2208 S(1, q \u2212 1) and \u03c6(eaq ) = pn((a1 ,...,aq )) ea1 , with\nn((a1 , ..., aq )) \u2208 Z\nrelatively prime to q \u2208 N. Let m \u2208 N be such that pm Lie(G) is included in the W (k)-span\nE of B. We take n \u2208 N such that\n(EST )\n\nn \u2265 2m + 1 + sL (\u03c6).\n\nWe want to show that there is h \u2208 G(W (k)) congruent to the identity mod\np\nand such that hhn \u03c6 = \u03c6h. By induction on t \u2208 N we show that there is\nh \u2208 G(W (k)) congruent to the identity mod pn+t\u22121\u2212m and such that hhn \u03c6h\u22121 \u03c6\u22121 \u2208\nG(W (k)) is congruent to the identity mod pn+t . It is enough to deal with the case t = 1.\nWe use what we call the stairs method (modeled on < e1 , ..., ev >).\nm+1+sL (\u03c6)\n\nWe take h = h\u03031 h\u03032 , where\n(P ROD)\n\nh\u03031 :=\n\nY\n\n(1M + xl pul el ),\n\nl\u2208S(1,v)\n\nwith ul \u2208 N depending only on the cycle C of \u03c0L to which l belongs and with xl \u2208 W (k),\nand where h\u03032 \u2208 GL(M )(W (k)) is congruent to the identity mod pn+1+sL (\u03c6) . We always\ntake ul as the maximal possible value allowed by hn in the sense that hn , up to elements of\nGL(M )(W (k)) congruent to the identity mod pn+1+sL (\u03c6) , can be similarly written down\nas such a product hn = h1n h2n . In particular, we always have ul \u2265 n \u2212 m \u2265 m + 1 + sL (\u03c6)\nand so the order in which products of the above form (PROD) are taken is irrelevant mod\np2(n\u2212m) and so mod pn+1+sL (\u03c6) ; this also guarantees that hn , up to elements congruent to\nthe identity mod pn+1+sL (\u03c6) , can be similarly written down as such a product. Warning:\nh\u03031 is not in general an element of G(W (k)); however, mod pn+1+sL (\u03c6) it is and so,\n266\n\n\fas G is smooth, we can always choose h\u03032 such that h \u2208 G(W (k)). The expression of\nhhn \u03c6h\u22121 \u03c6\u22121 \u2208 G(W (k)) mod pn+1 does not depend on h\u03032 .\nQ\nMoreover, if h\u2032 = l\u2208S(1,v) (1 + x\u2032l pul el ), with all x\u2032l 's in W (k), then hh\u2032 is congruent\nQ\nmod pn+1+sL (\u03c6) to l\u2208S(1,v) [1 + (x\u2032l + xl )pul el ]. We call this property as ADD.\n\nWe need to show that we can choose xl 's such that hhn \u03c6h\u22121 \u03c6\u22121 \u2208 G(W (k)) is\ncongruent to the identity mod pn+1 . This boils down to: if hn is not congruent to the\nidentity mod pn+1 , then we can choose xl 's such that writing hhn \u03c6h\u22121 \u03c6\u22121 \u2208 G(W (k))\nas a product as in (PROD), we can replace ul by ul + 1, \u2200l \u2208 S(1, v). Concentrating on\na fixed cycle C := Ci0 of \u03c0L , we need to show the existence of solutions of a system of\nequations over k of the following circular form\nbj x\u0303aj = dj x\u0303paj\u22121 + cj ,\n\n(22)\n\nj \u2208 S(1, q) (here q + 1 = 1), where cj , dj \u2208 k, and with:\n\u2013 bj = 1 for all j \u2208 S(1, q), if n(C) \u2265 0, and with\n\u2013 bj = 1 for all j \u2208 S(1, q \u2212 1) and with bq = 0 and all dj 's equal to 1, if n(C) < 0.\nThe above system of equations is viewed over k and its shape can be obtained as\nusual, by working mod p in the context of the W (k)-submodule of E generated by all\nthese pul el 's. In other words, based on ADD, the variable x\u0303aj is defined as:\n\u2013 xaj mod p, if n(C) \u2265 0;\n\u2013 xaj mod p for j 6= q and as yaq mod p for j = q, where yaq \u2208 W (k) is defined by\nthe identity xaq = p\u2212n(C) yaq (i.e. we take xaq to be divisible by p\u2212n(C) ), if n(C) < 0.\nSo, we just need to show that such a system of equations does have a solution: in\ncase n(C) \u2265 0, 3.6.8.1 (with s = 0 and l = 1) applies directly (as k = k\u0304), while in case\nn(C) < 0 we can just apply the fact that k is perfect; if n(C) \u2265 0 it is easy to see, without\nappealing to 3.6.8.1, that (22) does have solutions in k. This ends the proof in the context\nwithout pM .\nWe now deal with the context involving pM . We can assume G does not fix pM . Let\nT be a 1 dimensional torus of Z(G) which does not fix pM and which has a split Zp structure TZp such that the elements of TZp (Zp ) = Gm (Zp ) are naturally isomorphisms\nof (M, \u03c6, G); this is nothing else but end of 2.2.9 12) adapted to (M, \u03c6, G, pM ). Let rf\nbe the rank of the maximal finite, flat group subscheme of T fixing pM . Let\nm(rf ) \u2208 N\nbe the smallest number such that any element of Gm (Zp ) congruent to 1 mod pm(rf ) is\nthe rf -th power of an element of Gm (Zp ). We get:\nFact. \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 Gm (Zp ) congruent to the identity modulo pm(rf ) , (M, \u03c6, G, pM ) and\n(M, \u03c6, G, \u03b1pM ) are isomorphic under an isomorphism defined by an element of T (Zp ).\n267\n\n\fSo the Lemma in the context involving pM follows from this Fact and from its part\nin the context without pM : we just need to take n \u2208 N such that\n(EST P )\n\nn \u2265 max{2m + 1 + sL (\u03c6), m(rf )}.\n\n3.6.16. Definitions and remarks. 1) We say N has the completion property, if\n3.6.15 A holds.\n2) The smallest possible value of the number n of 3.6.15 B, is called the isomorphism\ndeviation of (M, \u03c6, G) and is denoted by isom \u2212 d(M, \u03c6, G).\n3) To our knowledge, 3.6.15 B was not known previously even for the classical\nsituation when G = GSp(M, pM ) and (M, \u03c6) is an object of p \u2212 M[0,1] (W (k)), with M\nof rank big enough (like greater than 7).\n3.6.16.1. Terminology. All connections used in 3.6.1-16 as well as in 2.2-3 are\ncalled (in the honor of their source [Fa2, th. 10 and the remarks after]) Faltings connections.\n3.6.17. Solution of 3.6.6.0. We proceed by induction. We can assume g2 \u2208\nP0 (W (k)) and k = k\u0304. So we can replace \u03c60 by \u03c61 (we recall that P0 = P1 , cf. 3.3.2). But\n(M, F 1 , g2 \u03c61 ) is itself cyclic diagonalizable: based on 3.3.4 and 2.2.3 3), the elements of\ng[ p1 ] fixed by g2 \u03c61 take F 1 [ p1 ] into itself and form a reductive Qp -Lie subalgebra of g[ p1 ] of\nthe same rank as g[ p1 ]. So 2.2.18 applies and so (cf. its proof or cf. the Fact of 2.2.22 1))\nthere is a torus of P0 whose Lie algebra is normalized by g2 \u03c60 . Using Zp -structures as in\n2.2.9 8), we get that we can assume it is a maximal torus. Arguments as in the proof of\nFact 1 of 2.2.9 3), show that, up to isomorphisms defined by elements of P0 (W (k)), we\ncan assume it is T itself. So g2 \u2208 P0 (W (k)) normalizes T and so g2 \u03c61 has all properties\nof \u03c61 we needed to get 3.4.3.0. Not to introduce extra notations, we can assume g2 = 1M .\nLet g3 \u2208 G(W (k)) be congruent to the identity mod pm , m \u2208 N. So g3 mod pm+1\ncan be written down as 1M + pm x, with x = x1 + x2 , where x1 \u2208 p0 and x2 belongs to the\nLie algebra p<0 of g corresponding to negative slopes of (g, \u03c61 ). We take h \u2208 G(W (k))\nsuch that mod pm+2 is\nm\n\nm\n\n1M + p e0 + p\n\ns1\nX\n\ndimW (k) (p<0 )\nm+1\n\nys es + p\n\ns=1\n\nX\n\nys es ,\n\ns=s1 +1\n\nP\nwhere e0 \u2208 p0 , ys 's are elements of W (k), s1 :=\ndimW (k) (Mi ) and {e1 , ..., es1 }\nQ i\u2208I\nQ\n(resp. {es1 +1 , ..., edimW (k) (p<0 ) }) is a W (k)-basis of i\u2208I Mi (resp. of i\u2208I Ni\u2212 ) formed\nby elements normalized by T (cf. the proof of 3.6.6 for notations).\nLet B0 be an arbitrary W (k)-basis of p0 . Let B1 be the W (k)-basis of Lie(G) obtained by putting B0 and {e1 , ..., edimW (k) (p<0 ) } together. As in the proof of 3.6.15 B, the\ncongruence hg3 \u03c61 h\u22121 \u2212 1M \u2261 0 mod pm+1 gets translated in a system of equations SE\nwith coefficients in k in the d variables obtained by taking the reduction mod p of all ys 's\n268\n\n\fand of the coefficients zs 's, s \u2208 S(dimW (k) (p<0 ) + 1, d), of e0 w.r.t. B0 ; the equations\nof SE are obtained by identifying with 0 the coefficients of hg3 \u03c61 h\u22121 \u2212 1M mod pm+1\nw.r.t. reduction mod pm+1 of B1 . SE is a direct sum of two subsystems SE1 (involving\njust the variables zs 's) and SE2 (involving just the variables ys 's). SE1 is a system of\nequations of first type in dimW (k) (p0 ) variables. Moreover, as k = k\u0304, SE2 is a disjoint\nunion of systems of equations of exactly the same type as the ones obtained in the proof\nof 3.6.15 B, corresponding to n(C) < 0 (cf. the Weyl decomposition of 3.4.3.0). So as in\nthe mentioned proof, SE1 and SE2 have solutions in k. So using induction, up to inner\nisomorphisms, we can assume g3 = 1M . This solves 3.6.6.0.\n3.6.18. General principles for connections in Fontaine categories. Let\nm \u2208 N \u222a {0}. The notations to be used in 3.6.18-20 are entirely independent from the\nprevious notations of \u00a73, except that k and \u03c3 will have the same meaning. We keep\nassuming p \u2265 3, though all arguments below, except very few exceptions, work for p = 2\nas well; these exceptions are listed in 3.14. In this section\nR := W (k)[[z1 , ..., zm ]]\nis the ring of formal power series in m variables with coefficients in W (k). Let \u03a6R be an\narbitrary Frobenius lift of R.\nAny object of a category MF[a,b] (R) lifts to a p-divisible object (see Fact of 2.2.1.1\n6) and 2.2.1 f)). So we prefer to look at such objects as being obtained from truncations\n(mod pn , for some n \u2208 N \u222a {0}) of p-divisible objects, by a repeated finite process of\nextensions (via short exact sequences).\nWe start with a p-divisible object\nC := (M \u2297W (k) R, F 1 \u2297W (k) R, \u03a6),\nof MF[0,1] (R). Here M is a free W (k)-module of finite rank, F 1 is a direct summand of\nM , while \u03a6 is a \u03a6R -linear endomorphism of M \u2297W (k) R producing an isomorphism (still\ndenoted by \u03a6) of R-modules\n1\n \u0303\n\u2297W (k) R.\n\u03a6 : (M + F 1 ) \u2297R \u03a6R R\u2192M\np\nA natural question arises:\nQ Is there a p-divisible group over R, whose corresponding p-divisible object of\n\u2207\nMF[0,1]\n(R), when viewed just as a p-divisible object of MF[0,1] (R), is C?\nIf its answer is yes, we say C is induced from a p-divisible group. Similarly we speak\n\u2207\nabout C being induced (cf. also 2.2.1.3) from a p-divisible object of MF[0,1]\n(R1 ) via a\nW (k)-homomorphism R1 \u2192 R, where R1 is a regular, formally smooth W (k)-algebra.\n3.6.18.0. Types of Frobenius lifts of R. [Fa2, th. 10] can be restated: the\nanswer to Q is yes provided \u03a6R is of the form \u03a6R (zi ) = zip , i = 1, m. This assumption\n269\n\n\f(on the special shape of \u03a6R ) has been made in [Fa2, ch. 7] (quoting) \"for technical\nreasons\".\nLet S(m) := S(1, m) and let S(M ) := S(1, dimW (k) (M )). Any Frobenius lift \u03a6R of\nR is uniquely determined by equations\n(23)\n\n\u03a6R (zi ) = zip + pPi (z1 , ..., zm) + pLi (z1 , ..., zm ) + p\u03b3i ,\n\nP\u221e\nwhere Pi = l=2 Qil , with Qil a homogeneous polynomial of degree l \u2265 2 in m variables,\nwhere Li is a linear homogeneous polynomial and \u03b3i \u2208 W (k), \u2200i \u2208 S(m). It is easy to\nsee that by replacing zi by zi + p\u03b4i , with \u03b4i \u2208 W (k) conveniently chosen, \u2200i \u2208 S(m), we\ncan assume \u03b3i = 0, \u2200i \u2208 S(m): by induction on l \u2208 N we can check that we can assume\npl divides p\u03b3i ; this is the general argument showing the existence of (the well known)\nTeichm\u00fcller lifts. We assume this from now on.\nWe can write the Frobenius endomorphism \u03a6 of M \u2297W (k) R in the form\n\u03a6 = gR (\u03c6 \u2297 1),\nwhere gR \u2208 GL(M )(R) modulo the ideal (z1 , ..., zm ) of R is the identity element 1M of\nG(W (k)) and where \u03c6 is the \u03c3-linear endomorphism of M obtained from \u03a6 by taking\nzi = 0, \u2200i \u2208 S(m). So what we are trying to do (for answering Q), is nothing else but\nto deform over R the p-divisible group DW (k) := D\u22121 (M, F 1 , \u03c6) over W (k), in the way\n\"prescribed\" by C. The use of D\u22121 is part of the second place (see 3.6.2) where we need\np > 2.\nWe write\nm\nX\naij zj ,\nLi (z1 , ..., zm ) =\nj=1\n\nwith aij \u2208 W (k), \u2200i, j \u2208 S(m). We obtain a matrix A(\u03a6R ) \u2208 Mm (W (k)), having aij as\nits entries. Let\n\u0100(\u03a6R ) \u2208 Mm (k)\nbe the matrix obtained by taking A(\u03a6R ) mod p. We call A(\u03a6R ) (resp. \u0100(\u03a6R )) the linear\npart (resp. the k-linear part) of \u03a6R w.r.t. z1 , ..., zm . To study how A(\u03a6R ) changes under\na W (k)-automorphism of R which modulo its ideal (z1 , ..., zm ) is the identity, we can\nrestrict\nto linear W (k)-automorphisms, i.e. to W (k)-automorphisms of R taking zi to\nPm\nj=1 bij zj , with bij \u2208 W (k) defining an invertible matrix B \u2208 GLm (W (k)) (argument:\na W (k)-automorphism of R which is the identity modulo (z1 , ..., zm )2 , does not changes\nA(\u03a6R )). Under such a linear W (k)-automorphism the matrix A(\u03a6R ) is replaced by\n\u03c3(B)A(\u03a6R )B \u22121 ; so \u0100(\u03a6R ) is replaced by\nB\u0304 [p] \u0100(\u03a6R )B\u0304 \u22121 ,\nwith B\u0304 \u2208 GLm (k) equal to B mod p (see end of 2.1 for the meaning of B\u0304 [p] ).\nIn what follows it is important only how \u0100(\u03a6R ) looks like.\n270\n\n\f3.6.18.0.1. Terminology. If \u03a6R (zi ) = zip (resp. if \u03a6R (zi ) = (zi + 1)p \u2212 1),\n\u2200i \u2208 S(m), we speak about an additive (resp. multiplicative) type Frobenius lift of R.\nIf A(\u03a6R ) (resp. \u0100(\u03a6R )) is an invertible (resp. a nilpotent) matrix, we speak about an\nessentially multiplicative (resp. additive) type Frobenius lift of R. We also say that \u03a6R\nis of (essentially) multiplicative (or additive) type.\n3.6.18.0.1.1. The global context. Here, as a digression, we globalize the above\nterminology. We consider now an arbitrary regular, formally smooth W (k\u0303)-scheme X\u0303\nequipped with a Frobenius lift \u03a6X\u0303 , where k\u0303 is an arbitrary perfect field. We consider\na closed embedding \u1ef9 : Spec(k\u03031 ) \u0592\u2192 X\u0303, with k\u03031 an algebraic field extension of k\u0303. We\nsay \u03a6X\u0303 is a multiplicative (or additive, or essentially multiplicative or additive) type\nFrobenius lift of X\u0303 in \u1ef9, if the Frobenius lift of (the W (k\u0303)-algebra of global sections of)\nthe completion of X\u0303 in \u1ef9 induced naturally by \u03a6X\u0303 , is of the corresponding type.\n3.6.18.1. Notations. Let f (0) := dimW (k) (M/F 1 ) and f (1) := dimW (k) (F 1 ). We\ndenote by s(i) the multiplicity of the slope i for (M, \u03c6), i \u2208 {0, 1}. So s(0)s(1) is the\nmultiplicity of the slope \u22121 of the Lie \u03c3-crystal (End(M ), \u03c6). Let r be the number of\nnon-zero eigenvalues (counted with their multiplicities) in k\u0304 of \u0100(\u03a6R ); we refer to it as\nthe rank of \u03a6R .\n3.6.18.1.1. Remarks. It is easy to see that r is well defined regardless of all\nchoices (cf. also 3.6.18.4 B) below). In particular the notion of essentially additive type\nFrobenius lift of R (case r = 0) is well defined. We can have r = 0 without \u0100(\u03a6R ) being\n0. So, if m \u2265 2, we have plenty of essentially additive type Frobenius lifts of R which are\nnot of additive type.\nOn the other, if k = k\u0304 it can be easily checked that, up to a suitable change of\nvariables, the notions of multiplicative type and of essentially multiplicative type coincide.\nWe sketch the argument for this well known fact. If \u03a6(zi ) = (zi + 1)p \u2212 1, i = 1, m, and\nif \u03a61 is an essentially multiplicative type Frobenius lift of R taking (z1 , ..., zm) into itself,\nthen by induction on q \u2208 N we show that (up to a change of variables) we can assume\n\u03a6(zi ) \u2212 \u03a61 (zi ) \u2208 p(z1 , ..., zm )q+1 , \u2200i \u2208 S(1, m). For q = 1 this is a consequence of the\nfact that for any A \u2208 GLm (W (k)), there is B \u2208 GLm (W (k)) such that \u03c3(B)B \u22121 = A.\nAssuming that the statement is true for q \u2212 1, to prove it for q, we show by induction on\nl \u2208 N that we can assume \u03a6(zi )\u2212\u03a61 (zi ) \u2208 pl+1 (z1 , ..., zm)q +p(z1 , ..., zm )q+1 , \u2200i \u2208 S(1, m):\nif \u03a6(zi ) \u2212 \u03a61 (zi ) \u2261 pl Pi (z1 , ..., zm ) modulo pl+1 (z1 , ..., zm)q + p(z1 , ..., zm)q+1 , with Pi 's as\nhomogeneous forms of degree q, then replacing zi by zi \u2212pl\u22121 Pi (z1 , ..., zm ) we get that we\ncan assume that Pi 's are all 0. As Rm is (p, z1 , ..., zm )-adically complete, the conclusion\nfollows.\nBut this is not so if k 6= k\u0304; example: if k = Fp then \u03a6R (zi ) = (zi + 1)p \u2212 1 + p2 zi is\nnot of multiplicative type, as its linear part w.r.t. z1 , ..., zm is not conjugate over Zp to\nthe identity matrix of Mm (Zp ).\n3.6.18.1.2. Exercise. We assume r = 0. Show that there is a sequence of ideals\n(In )n\u2208N\u222a{0} of R such that I0 = R, \u2229n\u2208N In = pR, In\u22121 /In is isomorphic to k as an\nR-module and d\u03a6R \u2217 /p(In ) \u2282 In+1 \u03a9\u2227\nR/W (k) , \u2200n \u2208 N. Hint: we can assume \u0100(\u03a6R ) is\n271\n\n\f\u0001\nnilpotent and lower triangular; so d\u03a6R \u2217 /p(zi ) \u2208 p, zi+1 , ..., zm) + (zjs )j,s\u2208S(1,i) \u03a9\u2227\nR/W (k) ,\n2\n2 2\n\u2200i \u2208 S(1, m) (so we can take I1 = (p, z1 , z2 , ..., zm ), I2 = (p, z1 , z2 , z1 z2 , z3 , z4 , ...., zm),...,\nIm = (p) + (z1 , ..., zm )2 , Im+1 = (p) + (z2 , ..., zm)2 + (z13 ) + z1 (z2 , ..., zm ), etc.).\n3.6.18.2. The generic situation. This is obtained by requiring:\na) (M, \u03c6) to have all slopes 0 and 1 and (M, F 1 , \u03c6) to be diagonalizable;\nb) \u03a6R (zi ) = (zi + 1)p \u2212 1, \u2200i \u2208 S(m);\nc) k = k\u0304.\nWe have:\nFact. For any n \u2208 N, there are precisely\npnmf (0)f (1)\nconnections on C/pn C, regardless of the shape of gR . They are all integrable and nilpotent\nmod p.\nProof: The first part is just a very particular case of 3.6.18.4 B) below (which\nis proved independently of this proof). However, we felt it is appropriate to include a separate proof of it, to make the connection to previous work (in particular, see [De3]) and to prepare the reader for the general case. We consider a W (k)basis B = {e1 , ..., edimW (k) (M ) } of M such that \u03c6(ei ) = p\u03b5i ei , with \u03b5i \u2208 {0, 1},\n\u2200i \u2208 S(1, dimW (k) (M )). Let I 0 (resp. I 1 ) be the set of those i's such that \u03b5i = 0\n(resp. \u03b5i = 1); so f (0) = I 0 and f (1) = I 1 . We can assume that gR fixes all ei 's with\ni \u2208 I 0 and that, \u2200i \u2208 I 1 we have\nX\ngR (ei ) \u2212 ei =\naij ej ,\nj\u2208I 0\n\nwith all aij 's in R. The argument for this is entirely the same as the inductive argument\nof 3.6.18.1.1.\nBut any connection \u2207n on M \u2297W (k) R/pn R which makes C/pn C potentially to be\nviewed as an object of MF[0,1](R) annihilates all ei 's with i \u2208 I 0 and, \u2200i \u2208 I 1 it takes ei\ninto\n(N ABLA)\n\nm X\nX\n\naijl ej dzl ,\n\nl=1 j\u2208I 0\n\nwith aijl \u2208 R/pn R such that mod pn we have\n(24)\n\naijl = \u03a6R (aijl )(zl + 1)p\u22121 + bijl ,\n\n\u2200(j, l) \u2208 I0 \u00d7 S(1, m). Here bijl 's are elements of R such that we have equalities\n(25)\n\nm\nX\n\nbijl dzl = daij ,\n\nl=1\n\n272\n\n\f\u2200(i, j) \u2208 I1 \u00d7 I0 . Starting from the shape of \u2207 we get that, \u2200l \u2208 S(1, m) and \u2200fr \u2208 R,\nwe have:\n\u2207(\n\n(N 0)\n\n\u2202 p\n) (fr ei ) \u2261 0 mod p\n\u2202zl\n\nif i \u2208 I0 and\n\u2207(\n\n(N 1)\n\n\u2202 2p\u22121\n)\n(fr ei ) \u2261 0 mod p\n\u2202zl\n\nif i \u2208 I1 . So \u2207n is nilpotent mod p (we could just quote 3.6.1.1 2) but (N1) is slightly\nmore precise than loc. cit.). To check that \u2207n is integrable, we just need to show that\nthe differential form\nX\n(DF )\nw :=\naijl eij dzl\n(i,j,l)\u2208I1 \u00d7I0 \u00d7S(1,m)\n\nis closed, where {eij |i, j \u2208 S(1, dimW (k) (M ))} is the W (k)-basis of End(M ) defined\nnaturally (as in 3.6.8 3)) by B. But from (24) we get that\n(EQ)\n\ndw =\n\nX\n\n\u03a6R (daijl )eij (zl + 1)p\u22121 dzl = \u03a6R\u2217 /p(dw).\n\n(i,j,l)\u2208I1 \u00d7I0 \u00d7S(1,m)\n\nSo the differential 2-form dw is zero mod p. Plugging this in the right hand side of (EQ)\nwe get that dw is zero mod p2 , etc. Using mathematical induction we get dw = 0.\nAs \u03a6R (aijl ) mod p is apijl mod p and as zl + 1 is invertible in R, the number of such\nconnections \u22071 is pms(0)s(1) (cf. (24)). But using the constancy property (see 3.6.8.9),\n3.6.8.1.2 a) and c) and induction on n \u2208 N, the Fact gets reduced to the case n = 1. This\nproves the Fact.\n3.6.18.2.1. Two philosophies. The reason we call this the generic situation is\nrelated to [De3, 1.4.7]. There are two philosophies at play:\n\u2013 any p-divisible group over k is the specialization of an ordinary p-divisible group\n(cf. 3.1.8 and 3.1.8.1);\n\u2013 whatever we can prove for the standard situation and does not involve the precise\nnon-negative, integral power of p of the number of solutions we get for different systems\nof equations (in the other cases we get smaller powers of p), can be proved in the general\ncase (in particular we always get solutions).\nAs samples for this second philosophy see 3.6.18.4 below. This second philosophy\nworks also in the more general context where the category MF[0,1](R) is replaced by\nanother one MF[a,b] (R), with a, b \u2208 Z, a < b (so we keep 3.6.18.2 b) and c), while\n3.6.18.2 a) is modified accordingly; see 3.6.18.5.5 below).\n273\n\n\f3.6.18.2.2. Remark. Let C0 be an object of MF[0,1](R) which is the extension of\nan object of MF[1,1] (R) by an object of MF[0,0] (R). Then the same arguments of the\nproof of 3.6.18.2 apply to get that any connection on C0 is integrable.\n3.6.18.3. Example. It is easy to see that the question Q does not always have a\npositive answer. Here is a simple example for which the answer to Q is no. Let R = Zp [[t]]\nwith \u03a6R (t \u2212 1) = (t \u2212 1)p . We take M to be a free Zp -module of dimension 2. Let {x, y}\nbe a Zp -basis of M such that {y} is a Zp -basis of F 1 . Let \u03a6(x) = x and \u03a6(y) = py + ptx.\nThere is no connection \u2207 on M \u2297Zp R for which \u03a6 is \u2207-parallel. Argument: such a\nconnection must annihilate x and takes y into axdt (to be compared with 3.6.1.4 2)),\nwhere a \u2208 R, when taken mod p, must satisfy the equation up (t \u2212 1)p\u22121 = u + 1 in u with\ncoefficients in R/pR; as the equation v p = v + 1 has no solution in Fp , no such a exists.\nOn the other hand, it can be checked by directly computing a (for instance, cf. the proof\nof 3.6.18.2; see also 3.6.18.4 below) that, if we move from Zp to W (F) (i.e. if we replace\nFp by its algebraic closure), (M \u2297Zp W (F)[[t]], F 1 \u2297Zp W (F)[[t]], \u03a6 \u2297 1) is induced from a\np-divisible group over W (F)[[t]]. So the \"obstruction\" in the existence of \u2207 is: the field\nFp is not \"big enough\".\n3.6.18.3.1. Lemma. If there is an integrable connection \u2207 on M \u2297W (k) R which\n\u2207\nmakes C to be viewed as a p-divisible object of MF[0,1]\n(R), then C is induced from a\np-divisible group.\nProof: The connection \u2207 is also nilpotent mod p, cf. [Fa1, p. 34] or 3.6.1.1.2. So\nit allows us to change the Frobenius lift of R to one of additive type, cf. [De3, (1.1.2.1)].\nNow everything results from 2.2.21 UP.\n3.6.18.4. Theorem (the universal local \u2207 principle for MF[0,1] ). We assume\nk = k\u0304. We have:\nA) There are connections on C.\nB) Let n \u2208 N. The number of connections on C/pn C is pnrs(0)s(1) ; this number is\nsmaller or equal to pnmf (0)f (1) . Each such connection lifts to precisely prs(0)s(1) connections on C/pn+1 C.\nProof: A) follows from B); in fact its proof is contained in the proof of 3.6.1.3, cf.\n3.6.8.4 1) to 3) and the constancy property of 3.6.8.9. For future references the proof of\nB) is divided into parts, indexed by numbers attached to the right of the letter P .\nP1. The inequality part of B) is obvious. From 3.6.8.1.2 c) and the constancy\nproperty of 3.6.8.9 we deduce that for the counting part of B) it is enough to show that\nthe number of connections on C/pC is precisely prs(0)s(1) . As k = k\u0304, from 3.6.18.0 we\ndeduce that we can assume the matrix \u0100(\u03a6R ) is upper triangular. To construct (get) a\nconnection on C/pC is the same thing (see 3.6.8 (3)) as getting a solution in R/pR of a\nsystem of equations of the form\nxijl = Lijl (xp111 , ..., xpdimW (k) (M ) dimW (k) (M )m ) + cijl ,\n274\n\n\f(i, j, l) \u2208 S(M )\u00d7S(M )\u00d7S(m), where Lijl are linear homogeneous forms in m dimW (k) (M )2\nvariables and where cijl \u2208 R/pR, \u2200(i, j, l) \u2208 S(M ) \u00d7 S(M ) \u00d7 S(m).\nP2. This system of equations defines an \u00e9tale, affine scheme over Spec(R/pR), cf.\n3.6.8.1.2 a). We consider the ideal I := (z1 , ..., zm ) of R/pR. As R/pR is a strictly\nhenselian ring, it is enough to look at this system of equations modulo I. Due to the\nupper triangular form of \u0100(\u03a6R ), this system of equations modulo I can be \"separated\":\nFact. In the expression of Lijl modulo I only those variables xijl\u2032 show up for which\nl \u2264 l.\n\u2032\n\nSo this allows us to assume m = 1: first we solve the subsystem of equations we get\nin variables xij1 's; we use any solution of it to get a new system of equations in variables\nxij2 's (in other words, xij1 's become constants for this new system of equations involving\njust xij2 's); etc. (the induction applies; warning: all these are modulo I). From now on,\nas m = 1, we drop the index l. So modulo I we get a system S of dimW (k) (M )2 equations\nin dimW (k) (M )2 variables with coefficients in k.\nP3. If \u0100(\u03a6R ) \u2208 k is 0, then the system S is of the form xij = dij , (i, j) \u2208 S(M ) \u00d7\nS(M ), with dij \u2208 k. Obviously it has a unique solution. So we can assume \u03b2 := \u0100(\u03a6R ) \u2208\nk is non-zero (in fact we can assume \u03b2 = 1).\nModulo I, gR contributes only to the coefficients dij (obtained by taking cij modulo\nI). So 3.6.8.1.2 c) implies we can assume gR is the identity element of GL(M )(R).\nP4. We present first the particular case when (M, F 1 , \u03c6) is cyclic diagonalizable.\nWe consider a W (k)-basis {ei |i \u2208 S(M )} of M . We can assume there is a subset S(F 1 )\nof S(M ) such that {ei |i \u2208 S(F 1 )} is a W (k)-basis of F 1 and there is a permutation \u03c0 of\nS(M ) such that \u03c6(ei ) = pe\u03c0(i) , if i \u2208 S(F 1 ), and \u03c6(ei ) = e\u03c0(i) , if i \u2208\n/ S(F 1 ) (cf. 2.2.1 d));\nlet d(\u03c0) \u2208 N be the order of \u03c0. We always take \u03c0 such that: if \u03c6v (ei ) = pu ei for any i\nbelonging to a v-cycle of \u03c0, with v \u2208 N and u \u2208 {0, v}, then this cycle has just 1 element\n(i.e. v = 1). The system S is of the form\n(26)\n\nx\u03c0(i)\u03c0(j) + dij = \u03b2\u03b1ij xpij ,\n\ni, j \u2208 S(M ), where \u03b1ij is 1 or 0 depending on the fact that (i, j) is or is not in (S(M ) \\\nS(F 1 )) \u00d7 S(F 1 ) and where dij \u2208 k (cf. (E1 ) and (E2 ) of 3.6.1.1.1 2)). So if \u03c0(i) 6= i or\nif \u03c0(j) 6= j, or if \u03c0(i) = i and \u03c0(j) = j but (i, j) \u2208\n/ (S(M ) \\ S(F 1 )) \u00d7 S(F 1 ), then in\nthe sequence of elements \u03b1ij , \u03b1\u03c0(i)\u03c0(j) ,..., \u03b1\u03c0 d(\u03c0)\u22121 (i)\u03c0 d(\u03c0)\u22121 (j) , at least one is 0; so such\nan xij is uniquely determined. For any pair (i, j), with \u03c0(i) = i and \u03c0(j) = j and with\ni\u2208\n/ S(F 1 ) and j \u2208 S(F 1 ), we have precisely p (independent) choices for xij . The number\nof such pairs is s(0)s(1). This handles the particular case.\nP5. We come back to the general case. We write\n(M, \u03c6) = (M1 , \u03c6) \u2295 (M0 , \u03c6) \u2295 (M01 , \u03c6)\nsuch that all slopes of (M1 , \u03c6), (M0 , \u03c6) and (M01 , \u03c6) are 1, 0 and respectively belong to the\ninterval (0, 1) (cf. the existence of the filtration F 1 of M ). Let B(\u03c6) \u2208 MdimW (k) (M ) (k) be\n275\n\n\fthe matrix formed naturally (i.e. it acts naturally on M/pM ) by a solution of the system\nS. From the shape of (E1 ) and (E2 ) of 3.6.1.1.1 2) we get that B(\u03c6) annihilates the\nimage of \u03c6(M ) in M/pM . This implies that B(\u03c6) annihilates M0 /pM0 \u2295 M(0,1) /pM(0,1) :\nif y1 \u2208 M(0,1) is non-zero mod p, then in the sequence of elements yu \u2208 M(0,1) \\ pM(0,1) ,\nu \u2208 N, u 6= 1, defined inductively by the rule \u03c6(yu ) = p\u03b5u yu\u22121 , with \u03b5u \u2208 {0, 1}, there is\na first element yu0 such that \u03b5u0 = 0; as in the particular case we (inductively) get that\nB(\u03c6) annihilates the reductions mod p of yu0 \u22121 ,..., y1 .\nSo we just need to look at the action of B(\u03c6) on the image in M1 /pM1 of elements\ne \u2208 M1 satisfying \u03c6(e) = pe. Writing \u2207( \u2202z\u2202 1 )(e) mod I as e0 +e1 +e01 , with e0 \u2208 M0 /pM0 ,\ne1 \u2208 M1 /pM1 and e01 \u2208 M01 /pM01 , we get (cf. (E2 ) of 3.6.1.1.1 2)) that e0 + e1 + e01 =\n\u03b2\u03c6(e0 + e1 + e01 ). So e1 and e01 are both 0. So B(\u03c6)(e) belongs to M0 /pM0 and so\nB(\u03c6) belongs to a s(0)s(1) dimensional k-vector subspace of End(M/pM ). The same\nargument of 3.6.8 9) (based on 3.6.8.1 and pertaining to number of points) shows that\nwe have at most ps(0)s(1) possibilities for B(\u03c6). From this we deduce (via 3.6.18.2) that\nthere are precisely ps(0)s(1) possibilities for B(\u03c6) and so solutions of S.\nP6. Another way (shorter and faster) to get this last sentence goes as follows. We\ncan assume \u03a6R (z1 ) = z1p + pz1 (so \u03b2 = 1); so working modulo (z1 ) instead of modulo\n(p, z1 ), we get similarly a matrix B\u0303(\u03c6) \u2208 MdimW (k) (M ) (W (k)) lifting B(\u03c6) and such that,\nwhen viewed as an endomorphism of M , we have (cf. (E1 ) and (E2 ) of 3.6.1.1.1 2) and\nthe fact that gR is the identity element of G(R))\n(27)\n\np\u03c6(B\u0303(\u03c6)) = B\u0303(\u03c6);\n\nit is 3.6.8.1.2 c) and the constancy part of 3.6.8.9 which allow us to consider such a lift\nB\u0303(\u03c6). (27) says that B\u0303(\u03c6) is an element of End(M ) fixed by p\u03c6. But the Zp -submodule\nSL\u22121 (resp. the W (k)-submodule) of End(M ) generated by such elements is of rank\ns(0)s(1) (resp. is a direct summand of rank s(0)s(1)).\nP7. One can combine the above two ways: without using any lifting argument (of\nB(\u03c6) to B\u0303(\u03c6)), we get (cf. (ENDFR) of 2.2.4 B): B(\u03c6) is fixed by the reduction mod p\nof the \u03c3-linear endomorphism p\u03c6 of End(M ) and so it belongs to SL\u22121 mod p.\nThis ends the proof of B) and so of the Theorem.\nP8. Exercise. Starting from 3.6.18.1.2, give a second proof of B).\n3.6.18.4.1. Theorem (the integrability principle for MF[0,1](R)). All connections \u2207 proved to exist in 3.6.18.4 are integrable and nilpotent mod p.\nProof: Let Ral := W (k)[z1 , ..., zm ]. Here the upper right index \"al\" stands for algebraization. The fact that a connection is integrable is expressed through some algebraic\nequations. In our case it is enough to check (regardless of which n \u2208 N \u222a {\u221e} we work\nwith) that these equations are satisfied modulo the ideal Jr := (p, z1 , ..., zm )r of R, for\nany r \u2208 N. But these equations modulo Jr depend only on the expressions of \u03a6 and\n\u03a6R modulo Jr+2 . This allows us to algebraize the things. From the Chinese Remainder\nTheorem we deduce the existence:\n276\n\n\fal\n\u2013 of a Frobenius lift \u03a6Ral of Ral which modulo its ideal Jr+2\n:= (p, z1 , ..., zm )r+2 is the\nsame as \u03a6R modulo Jr+2 and which modulo its ideal I1r+2 , with I1 := (p, z1 \u22121, ..., zm \u22121),\nis isomorphic to the one coming from a generic situation as in 3.6.18.2;\nal\n\u2013 of an element gRal \u2208 GL(M )(Ral ) such that modulo Jr+2\nit is gR modulo Jr+2 ,\nr+2\nal r+2\nand modulo I1 is an element g1 \u2208 GL(M )(Wn (k)) \u2282 GL(M )(R /I1 ) for which the\nFrobenius endomorphism of M \u2297W (k) Ral /I1r+2 defined by g1 (\u03c6 \u2297 1) is isomorphic to one\ncoming from a generic situation.\n\nWe assume n \u2208 N. Let \u2207n be a connection on M \u2297W (k) R/pn R which makes C/pn C\npotentially to be viewed as an object of MF[0,1](R). As in 3.6.1.3 (and its proof) we\nconstruct for the p-divisible object\nCal := (M \u2297W (k) Ral , F 1 \u2297W (k) Ral , gRal (\u03c6 \u2297 1))\n\u2227\n\nof MF[0,1] (Ral ) a moduli affine Spec(Ral )-scheme\nMn (Cal ) = Spec(Rn )\nof connections which make the extension of Cal /pn Cal to \u2217 potentially to be viewed as\n\u2207\nan object of MF[0,1]\n(\u2217); the Frobenius lift of Ral is \u03a6Ral and \u2217 stands for a p-adically\ncomplete, formally \u00e9tale Ral -algebra. Mod p it defines an \u00e9tale, affine scheme R(n) :=\nSpec(Rn /pRn ) over R(0) := Spec(Ral /pRal ). Moreover the fibres of R(n) over k-valued\npoints of R(0) have a number of points less or equal to the number n1 of k\u0304-valued points\nof the fibre F1 above the k-valued point of R(0) defined by zi = 1, i \u2208 S(m), cf. 3.6.18.4\nB). So the \u00e9tale, affine k-morphism rn : R(n) \u2192 R(0) is an \u00e9tale cover above the maximal\nopen subscheme of R(0) with the property that the fibres of rn above geometric points\nof it have precisely n1 points. We conclude:\nFact 1. Any connected component of R(n) contains points of F1 .\nFrom this and from 3.6.18.2 we get:\nFact 2. Mn (Cal ) is a moduli scheme of integrable connections, nilpotent mod p.\nThe last thing we need is:\nFact 3. \u2207n modulo the ideal (p, z1 , ..., zm)r of R/pn R, is equal to a connection\nobtained from the universal one on M \u2297W (k) Rn /pn Rn , through a formally \u00e9tale, affine\nW (k)-morphism Spec(R/pn R) \u2192 Mn (Cal ).\nThe easiest way to argue Fact 3 is to remark that Spec(Rn /(Jral + pn Ral )Rn ) is the\nmoduli scheme of maps (thought as \"pseudo-connections\")\n(P SCON N )\n\n\u2207r,n : M \u2297W (k) Ral /Jral + pn Ral \u2192 M \u2297W (k) F REEr,n,\n\nwith F REEr,n as the free Ral /Jral + pn Ral -module having dz1 ,..., dzm as a basis, satisfying the equations obtained from the equations satisfied by the universal connection\n277\n\n\fon M \u2297W (k) Rn /pn Rn by taking them modulo the ideal Jral + pn Ral of Ral . This is\na consequence of the fact that property (DIV) of 3.6.8 5) still holds modulo the ideal\nal\nJr+2\n+ pn Ral of Ral .\nFrom Facts 2 and 3 we get (we recall that r \u2208 N was arbitrary): \u2207n is integrable\nand nilpotent mod p. As n \u2208 N is arbitrary the same holds for the case of p-divisible\nobjects (i.e. for n = \u221e). This ends the proof of the Theorem.\n3.6.18.4.1.1. Corollary. Let n \u2208 N. We consider a connection \u2207 on C. For\n\u2202\nl \u2208 S(1, m), we consider the W (k)-linear endomorphism Dl := \u2207( \u2202z\n) of M \u2297W (k) R.\nl\nWe have:\na) Dl Ds = Ds Dl , \u2200s, l \u2208 S(1, m);\nb) Dl2p\u22121 mod p is 0, \u2200l \u2208 S(1, m).\nProof: a) is just a restatement of 3.6.18.4.1. We now argue b). From the proof of\n3.6.18.4.1 we get that we can assume we are in the context of a generic situation. So\neverything results from (N0) and (N1) of the proof of 3.6.18.4.2.\nb) represents a slight improvement to 3.6.1.1.2 (NIL2).\n3.6.18.4.2. Corollary (the moduli principle). For any regular, formally smooth\nW (k)-scheme or p-adic formal scheme S over Spec(W (k)) equipped with a Frobenius\nlift and having a connected special fibre, every object (resp. every p-divisible object) C\nof MF[0,1](S) defines a moduli p-adic formal scheme M (C) over S of connections (on\nthe underlying sheaves of modules of the pull back of C to formally \u00e9tale, p-adic formal\nschemes over S) which make the extension of C to such a p-adic formal scheme S1 to be\n\u2207\nviewed as an object (resp. as a p-divisible object) of MF[0,1]\n(S1 ). We have:\na) \u2200m \u2208 N, the SWm (k) -scheme M (C)Wm (k) is \u00e9tale and affine (resp. is N-pro-\u00e9tale\nand affine);\nb) Locally in the Zariski topology of Sk , the special fibre of M (C)Wm (k) is obtained\nthrough a finite sequence (resp. infinite sequence indexed by elements of N) of systems of\nequations of first type and defined using linear homogeneous forms having coefficients in\n(the ring of global sections of ) Sk ;\nc) The fibres of M (C)k over points with values in fields of Sk are non-empty. In\nthe case of an object of MF[0,1](S), these fibres are \u00e9tale schemes over fields defined by\nalgebras of dimension (as vector spaces over these fields) a non-negative, integral power\nof p.\nProof: c) follows from b), cf. 3.6.8.1 (applied with s = 0 and l = 1). Due to the\nuniversal property (implicit in the reference of M (C) as a moduli p-adic formal scheme),\nwe can work locally in the Zariski topology of Sk . So we can assume that S = Spec(R\u0303)\nis an affine scheme, that R\u0303 = R\u0303\u2227 , that \u03a9Sk /k is a free OSk -sheaf of finite rank, and that\nthe underlying R\u0303-module M\u0303 of C has the DC property, i.e. it is isomorphic to a direct\nsum\nq\nX\n(R\u0303/pi R\u0303)mi ,\ni=1\n\n278\n\n\fwith q \u2208 N and mi \u2208 N \u222a {0}, i = 1, q, cf. [Fa1, 2.1 ii)] (resp. and that M\u0303 is free). It is\nthe connectedness of Sk which allows us to consider such a q \u2208 N if C is an object.\nWorking with \"potentially to be viewed\" instead of \"to be viewed\", a) and b) are a\nconsequence of 3.6.8.4 1) to 3) and of 3.6.8.1.2 a), cf. also the below extra features for the\ncontext of objects. But (the proof of) 3.6.18.4.1 allows us to drop the word \"potentially\".\nWhen we pass from p-divisible objects to objects, there are three extra features\n(differences) showing up, which are worth being pointed out in detail. In what follows we\nassume C = (M\u0303 , F 1 (M\u0303 ), \u03c60 , \u03c61 ) is an object. It can happen that there are two distinct\nelements i, j \u2208 S(1, q) such that mi and mj are both non-zero. In such a situation,\nEnd(M\u0303 ) is not a free R\u0303/pl R\u0303-module for some l \u2208 S(0, q) and so it is much more convenient\n(in some sense compulsory) to work inductively on l \u2208 S(1, q) with End(M\u0303 )/pl End(M\u0303 )\ninstead of M\u0303 /pl M\u0303 . This is the first significant difference in comparison with the proof of\n3.6.1.3 and so the first extra feature.\nWe can assume F 1 (M\u0303 ) has also thePDC property (see proof of 2.2.1.1 6)). We\nq\nconsider a set B := {e1 , ..., er }, with r := i=1 mi , of elements of M\u0303 such that M\u0303 is the\ndirect sum of its cyclic R\u0303-submodules generated by them (the proof of 2.2.1.1 6) implies\nthat the annihilator of any element of B is generated by a power of p). We can assume\nF 1 (M\u0303 ) is generated by the elements of a subset of B. We refer to such a set B as an\nR\u0303-basis of C. Let E := {f1 , ..., fu} be the set of elements of End(M\u0303 ) such that:\n\u2013 End(M\u0303 ) is the direct sum of its cyclic R\u0303-submodules generated by them;\n\u2013 it is naturally defined by elements of B, i.e. for each s \u2208 S(1, u) there are s1 ,\ns2 \u2208 S(1, r) such that fu (ei ) = 0 if i 6= s1 and fu (es1 ) = pn(u) es2 , with n(u) \u2208 S(0, q).\nAlso we can assume there are elements z1 ,..., zv of R\u0303 such that {dz1 , ..., dzv } is an\nR\u0303-basis of the p-adic completion of \u03a9R\u0303/W (k) . The existence of a connection \u2207 on M\u0303\n\u2207\nmaking C to be viewed as an object MS[0,1]\n(S) can be codified (i.e. restated) in finding\nsolutions of v equations involving elements of End(M\u0303 ). So writing\n(28)\n\n\u2207 = \u03b40 +\n\nv X\nr\nX\n\nj \u2032 =1\n\nxjj \u2032 fj dzj \u2032 ,\n\nj=1\n\nwith \u03b40 an arbitrary but fixed connection on M\u0303 , we need to find solutions of a system of\nequations SE in the rv variables xjj \u2032 's. When viewed mod p it is of first type (this, as in\n3.6.8 5), is a consequence of the fact that M\u0303 is R\u0303-generated by \u03c6(M\u0303 ) and by \u03c61 (F 1 (M\u0303 ))),\nand so 3.6.8.1.2 a) applies as in the proof of 3.6.1.3 (for instance, see 3.6.8 7)). Working by\ninduction on l \u2208 S(1, q) modulo pl and following 3.6.8 10) to 12), we get a) and the part\nof b) which does not refer to linear homogeneous forms. For the integrability part, we\nneed to remark that based on 3.6.18.2.2 and the above part of the proof we can perform\nentirely the algebraization process of the proof of 3.6.18.4.1 in the context of arbitrary\nobjects of MF[0,1](R) (see also 3.6.18.5.2 below for a second possibility of arguing this,\nvia 3.6.18.4.1 and the Fact of 2.2.1.1 6)).\n279\n\n\fWe now point out the second significant difference in comparison with the proof of\n3.6.1.3 and so the second extra feature. By passing from things mod pl to things mod pl+1 ,\nwe get a system of equations in at most the same number of variables (the precise number\nof variables is v times the rank of pl End(M\u0303 )/pl+1 End(M\u0303 ) as an R\u0303/pR\u0303-module), and so\npotentially of a completely different form of what we got working mod pl , l \u2208 S(1, q \u2212 1).\nBut the situation is the same: we still get systems of equations of first type.\nAlso it is worth pointing out that the R\u0303/pR\u0303-module pl End(M\u0303 )/pl+1 End(M\u0303 ) is naturally a submodule of End(M\u0303 )/pEnd(M\u0303 ), and so the new systems of equations of first\ntype are related to specific subobjects of End(C)/pEnd(C) = End(C/pC); so the \"completely different forms\" are not \"too far\" from the initial form of SE. This is the third\nnew feature. It can be reformulated as: the linear homogeneous forms of these systems of equations depend only on End(C/pC) and on its (warning: non-necessarily Lie)\nsubobjects.\nConclusion: (we can assume) these systems of equations of first type have coefficients\nin R\u0303/pR\u0303. This proves a) and b) and ends the proof.\nExamples. As examples of such moduli p-adic formal schemes (resp. of special fibres\nof them) for connections, we have the p-adic completions (viewed as formal schemes) of\nn\nthe W (k)-schemes Spec(Q\u2227\nj,n ) (resp. the k-schemes S ), n \u2208 N, of 3.6.1.3 (resp. of 3.6.8).\nAs in Fact 2 of the proof of 3.6.18.4.1 we get:\n3.6.18.4.3. Corollary (the touching property). We assume we are in the\ncontext of 3.6.18.4.2, with C an object of MF[0,1] (S). Let pm , with m \u2208 N \u222a {0}, be\nthe maximal number of points Spec(k1 ) \u2192 M (C)k lifting the same k1 -valued point of\nSk , with k1 an algebraically closed field containing k. Then any connected component of\nM (C)k intersects all fibres of M (C)k over geometric points of Sk which are defined by\n\u00e9tale algebras of dimension, as vector spaces over residue fields of Sk , equal to pm .\n3.6.18.4.4. Remarks. 1) 3.6.18.4 remains true for the case when R/pR is a local\nhenselian ring and R is a regular, formally smooth W (k)-algebra, having k = k\u0304 as its\nresidue field.\n2) From now on, in connection to the categories MF[0,1](\u2217), we do not use (cf. the\nproof of 3.6.18.4.2) anymore the word potentially (see 3.6.1.1.1).\n3) The moduli schemes of 3.6.18.4.2 do depend on the choice of \u03a6S (for instance, cf.\n3.6.18.4 B)).\nFrom 3.6.18.4.2 b) and 3.6.8.1.2 b), as we are in a regular context, we get:\n3.6.18.4.5. Corollary (the surjectivity principle). Under the assumptions of\n3.6.18.4.2, any connected component of M (C)k , with C a p-divisible object, maps into an\nopen, dense subscheme of Sk .\n3.6.18.4.6. Extra terminology. What follows in this section is an abstract algebraic digression supplementing the first paragraphs of 3.6.8.9. In that paragraphs, we\ndefined abstractly systems of equations of first and third type, as well as, in connection to\n280\n\n\f3.6.8.5, we defined systems of equations of (adjusted) additive second type, while working\nwith an additive type Frobenius lift of a regular, formally smooth W (k)-algebra R.\nSimilarly, if the Frobenius lift involved is of multiplicative (resp. essentially multiplicative or additive) type (in some maximal point of Spec(R), see 3.6.18.0.1.1), we define\nsystems of equations of multiplicative (resp. essentially multiplicative or additive) second type; in 3.6.18.4 P4 (see (26) of it) we came across such systems of equations but we\npreferred to view them as of first type. The main difference from what we got in 3.6.8.5\n1) is: the coefficients of xpisl 's we get are not any more some p \u2212 1 powers of non-invertible\nelements (see 3.6.8.5 (11)) but they are of a more general nature; in particular they can\nbe invertible. Also in 3.6.14.1 J we introduced systems of equations of fourth type; in\nwhat follows they are not used.\nWe index different parts using capital letters.\nA. Let R\u0304 be an arbitrary Fp -algebra. Let n \u2208 N. A system of equations of the form\n(\u2217)\n\nxi = Li (xp1 , xp2 , ..., xpn) + ci ,\n\ni = 1, n, where Li is a linear homogeneous form with coefficients in R\u0304 and ci \u2208 R\u0304,\n\u2200i \u2208 S(1, n), is said to be of first type with coefficients in R\u0304 (cf. the terminology of\n3.6.8.9); we also call it a quasi Artin\u2013Schreier system of equations in n variables with\ncoefficients in R\u0304. It defines naturally an \u00e9tale, affine Spec(R\u0304)-scheme (cf. 3.6.8.1.2 a)). If\nthis system of equations defines a finite, \u00e9tale morphism (at the level of schemes), then\nwe omit the word quasi. The n \u00d7 n matrix obtained naturally (as in 3.6.8.1) from the\ncoefficients of the linear forms Li , i = 1, n, is called the matrix of the system (\u2217) of\nequations.\nWe came across such quasi Artin\u2013Schreier systems of equations in the proofs of\n3.6.1.3 and 3.6.18.4.2. For future references, we define as well (abstractly) systems of\nequations of second type: a system of equations of the form\n(29)\n\nai xpi = Li (x1 , x2 , ..., xn) + ci ,\n\ni = 1, m, and\n(30)\n\n0 = Li (x1 , x2 , ..., xn) + ci ,\n\ni = m + 1, n, where m \u2208 S(1, n), and where Li 's and ci 's are as above, is said to be of\nsecond type with coefficients in R\u0304, if at least one of the elements a1 ,..., am of R\u0304 is nonzero. However, as we do not use them again in the rest of this paper or in \u00a75-14, we do not\nstop to define abstractly systems of equations of (adjusted) additive (or multiplicative,\netc.) second type.\nB. Artin\u2013Schreier fundamental groups. An \u00e9tale cover q1 : Spec(R\u03041 ) \u2192\nSpec(R\u0304) is called crystalline elementary n-admissible if it is defined by an open closed\nsubscheme of an \u00e9tale cover of Spec(R\u0304) obtained using an Artin\u2013Schreier system of equations in at most n variables; here the \"at most\" part is motivated by the second extra\n281\n\n\ffeature of the proof of 3.6.18.4.2. We say q1 is crystalline n-admissible if it is obtained\nthrough (i.e. it is a composite of) a finite sequence of consecutive crystalline elementary\nn-admissible \u00e9tale covers.\nWe assume Spec(R\u0304) is connected. For all that follows, we fix a geometric point of\nSpec(R\u0304) in the usual way related to fundamental groups; not to complicate the notations\nand as below it is convenient to look at fundamental groups as groups of automorphism\nof Galois pro-\u00e9tale covers, we never mention it explicitly. The automorphism group of\nthe Galois pro-\u00e9tale cover of Spec(R\u0304) generated by connected components of crystalline\nn-admissible \u00e9tale covers of Spec(R\u0304), is called the level n Artin\u2013Schreier fundamental\ngroup of R\u0304 or of Spec(R\u0304) and it is denoted by \u03a0AS\nn (R\u0304). We have natural epimorphisms\nAS\n\u03a0AS\nn+1 (R\u0304) \u0589 \u03a0n (R\u0304).\n\nVariant: above we consider only finite sequences of length at most m, where m \u2208 N is\nfixed; we obtain pro-finite Galois groups \u03a0AS\nn,m (R\u0304) and natural epimorphisms\nAS\n\u03a0AS\nn1 ,m1 (R\u0304) \u0589 \u03a0n,m (R\u0304),\n\nwith n1 , m1 \u2208 N, n1 \u2265 n and m1 \u2265 m. We denote by \u03a0AS\n\u221e (R\u0304) the projective limit\nAS\nof \u03a0n (R\u0304). It is a quotient of the first fundamental group of Spec(R\u0304). We call it the\nArtin\u2013Schreier fundamental group of R\u0304 or of Spec(R\u0304). We have:\nC. Lemma (the fundamental lemma of the \u03c01 -theory in positive characteristic). If k1 is a field (not necessarily perfect) containing Fp , then \u03a0AS\n\u221e (k1 ) is exactly\nthe Galois group of k1 .\nProof: Let k2 be a finite Galois extension of k1 . Let n0 := [k2 : k1 ] and let\nE = {e1 , ..., en0 } be an arbitraryPk1 -basis of k2 . An arbitrary element x \u2208 k2 can be\nn0\nwritten uniquely as a sum x =\ni=1 xi ei , with xi \u2208 k1 , i = 1, n0 . We consider the\nequation\n(31)\n\nxp = x.\n\nIt gets translated into an Artin\u2013Schreier system of equations of the form\n(\u2217\u2217)\n\nxi = Li (xp1 , ..., xpn0 ),\n\ni = 1, n0 , with Li as linear homogeneous forms. The square matrix AE formed by the\ncoefficients of these linear forms is invertible (this can be seen by extension to k1perf ). So\n3.6.8.1.2 a) applies. So k2 splits over the Galois extension k3 of k1 generated by fields of\nwhose spectra are connected components of the \u00e9tale k1 -scheme defined naturally by this\nArtin\u2013Schreier system of equations (argument: the number of solutions of the equation\nxp = x in k2 \u2297k1 k3 is \u2013cf. 3.4.8.1.0\u2013 on one hand pn and on the other hand it is p to the\npower the number of connected components of Spec(k2 \u2297k1 k3 )). This ends the proof.\n282\n\n\fD. The global context. In the above Lemma the condition k1 is a field can be\nweaken: we just need that any projective k1 -module of finite rank is free. In particular\nit holds for local rings, for PID's and for polynomial rings over k. Warning: we do not\nneed to assume we are in some normal context; if s is a non-zero solution of (31) in any\nFp -algebra, then sp\u22121 is a projector and so it still \"isolates\" some connected components.\nSo to understand the first fundamental groups of arbitrary connected Fp -schemes we just\nneed to understand how to \"glue\" Artin\u2013Schreier systems of equations. This goes as\nfollows.\nThe proof of C above suggests looking only at Artin\u2013Schreier systems of equations\nwhich are defined by homogeneous linear forms whose coefficients are producing an invertible matrix. Referring to the proof of C, the change of the k1 -basis E, results in a\nreplacement of AE by BAE (B [p] )\u22121 , with B \u2208 GLn0 (k1 ) (warning: this is different from\n3.6.18.0). In general, two invertible matrices A1 and A2 of rank n with coefficients in R\u0304,\nare called F -equivalent (over R\u0304), if there is an invertible matrix B with coefficients in R\u0304\nsuch that A2 = BA1 (B [p] )\u22121 . So the determinants of A1 and A2 differ by a p \u2212 1 power\nof an invertible element of R\u0304.\nDefinition. Let Xp be arbitrary separated, connected Fp -scheme. A Galois\u2013Artin\u2013\nSchreier (or an Artin\u2013Schreier homogeneous invertible) system of equations in n variables\nover Xp is defined by:\n\u2013 an open cover OC of Xp by affine schemes Xpi = Spec(Ri ), i \u2208 I,\n\u2013 an invertible n \u00d7 n matrix Ai with coefficients in Ri , \u2200i \u2208 I,\n\u2013 an invertible n \u00d7 n matrix Bij with coefficients in Rij , \u2200i, j \u2208 I, where Xpi \u2229 Xpj =\nSpec(Rij ),\nsuch that the following two things hold\n[p]\n\na) \u2200i, j \u2208 I, over Xpi \u2229 Xjp we have Bij Aj (Bij )\u22121 = Ai , and\nb) \u2200i, j, l \u2208 I, over Xpi \u2229 Xpj \u2229 Xpl we have Bij Bjl = Bil .\nThe equivalence of two such Galois\u2013Artin\u2013Schreier systems of equations in n variables over Xp is defined in the standard manner (of passing to refinements of OC, etc.).\nFollowing the pattern of (**) above, we can use them to define an \u00e9tale cover of Xp of degree pn : above Xpi it is the \u00e9tale cover defined by the Artin\u2013Schreier system of equations\nin n variables xi1 ,.., xin whose linear forms are homogeneous and whose matrix is Ai itself,\n\u2200i \u2208 I; the identities a) and b) allow us to glue logically such \u00e9tale covers (i.e. Bij are\nthe matrices of the linear combination transitions from xis 's to xjs 's, s = 1, n, \u2200i, j \u2208 I: if\nxi is the column vector having xis 's as its entries, s = 1, n, then we have xi = Bij xj ).\nFollowing the pattern of B), we use such \u00e9tale covers to define a pro-finite Galois\ngroup \u03a0GAS\nn,m (Xp ), with m \u2208 N having the same role as above, as well as their N-projective\nGAS\nlimit \u03a0n (Xp ). We refer to \u03a0GAS\n(Xp ) as the level n Galois\u2013Artin\u2013Schreier fundamenn\ntal group of Xp . Moreover, by identifying an n \u00d7 n matrix with entries (aij )i,j\u2208S(1,n)\nwith a n + 1 \u00d7 n + 1 matrix whose entries (bij )i,j\u2208S(1,n+1) are defined by bij = aij and\n283\n\n\fbn+1,i = bj,n+1 = 0 if 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n, and by bn+1,n+1 = 1, we get a natural epimorphism\nGAS\n\u03a0GAS\n(Xp ), and so we define the N-projective limit\nn+1 (Xp ) \u0589 \u03a0n\n\u03a0GAS\n\u221e (Xp )\nof these groups \u03a0GAS\n(Xp ), n \u2208 N. Following the proof of C, we get:\nn\nLemma (the fundamental lemma of the \u03c01 -theory in positive characteristic: the global form). The fundamental group of Xp is \u03a0GAS\n\u221e (Xp ).\nIf Xp is moreover integral, regular and noetherian, the above Lemma represents (in\nour opinion) a practical way of computing the fundamental group of Xp . As a particular\ncase of this Lemma we get the following criterion:\nCorollary (a criterion of simply connectivity). The fundamental group of Xp\nis trivial iff \u2200n \u2208 N, any Galois\u2013Artin\u2013Schreier system of equations in n variables over\nXp is equivalent to the trivial one, defined by n \u00d7 n matrices which are all identity.\nE. Remarks. 1) The proof of C above implies Gal(k2 /k1 ) is naturally a quotient\nof\nIt is very much desirable to replace here the lower right index n0 , 1 with\nanother one n, 1, with n as small as possible. We do not know how to get in general\nbetter upper bounds for such an n. If n0 \u2265 2, by using 3.6.8.1.5 and the fact that 1, x,\nn0 \u22121\nare linearly dependent over k1 , for any x \u2208 k2 , we can take n = n0 \u2212 1; in\nxp ,..., xp\nthis way we can obtain a second proof of C (but not of D).\n\u03a0AS\nn0 ,1 (k1 ).\n\nl\n\n2) Let l \u2208 N. Using xpi 's instead of xpi 's in (*), we define similarly level (n, m, l)\nArtin\u2013Schreier fundamental groups \u03a0AS\nn,m,l (R\u0304); if l = 1, we always drop mentioning it as\nan index. Obviously (see 3.6.8.1.5) we have a natural epimorphism:\nAS\n\u03a0AS\nnl,m (R\u0304) \u0589 \u03a0n,m,l (R\u0304).\n\nSimilarly, in the context of D above, we define the level (n, m, l) Galois\u2013Artin\u2013Schreier\nl\nfundamental group \u03a0GAS\nn,m,l (Xp ) of Xp (so we have to speak about the F -equivalence\nrelation between invertible matrices with coefficients in a given Fp -algebra, etc.).\n3) There are n(n + 1) coefficients involved in the definition of a quasi Artin\u2013Schreier\nsystem of equations in n variables; they are entirely independent. One can learn a lot by\nlooking at quasi Artin\u2013Schreier systems of equations in a small number of variables, like\n2 or 3. For n = 2 we have 6 coefficients, while for n = 3 we have 12.\n4) If a quasi Artin\u2013Schreier system of equations with coefficients in R\u0304 defines a\nGalois cover of an open, dense subscheme of Spec(R\u0304), then the \u00e9tale scheme over Spec(R\u0304)\nnaturally associated to it is an open subscheme of a Galois cover of Spec(R\u0304). This is an\nimmediate consequence of 3.6.8.1.2 a).\n5) The Lemma of D (as well as the \"\u03c1\" part of 3.6.18.7.2 below) can be reformulated\nin terms of truncations mod p of unit F -crystals. However, B (and so implicitly F below)\ngoes beyond the reach of the language of such truncations: there are plenty of Artin\u2013\nSchreier systems of equations whose matrices are not invertible. Here are two quick\nexamples (with k as usual).\n284\n\n\fExample 1. Let R = k[t1 , t2 ]/(t1 t2 )n , with n \u2208 N \\ {1}; we take the system of\nequations (in z1 and z2 ) defined by z1 + c1 = t1 t2 z1p + t1 z2p and z2 + c2 = t2 z1p + z2p .\nExample 2. Let U := k[x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 ]/(x1 x3 \u2212 x2 x4 ); we take the system of equations z1 = x1 z1p + x2 z2p and z2 = x3 z1p + x4 z2p and we consider the maximal affine, open\nsubscheme Spec(R\u0304) of Spec(U ) above which this system of equations defines an \u00e9tale\ncover q : Spec(R\u03041 ) \u2192 Spec(R\u0304), cf. 3.6.8.1.3-4. We have:\n1) The complement of Spec(R\u0304) in Spec(U ) is irreducible and is not given by one\nsingle equation.\n2) The \u00e9tale cover q is of degree p and is not definable by an Artin\u2013Schreier system\nof equations in 1 variable.\n1) is left as an exercise (cf. [Ha, Exc. 6.5 of p. 147]). To argue 2), we assume q is\ngiven by the equation y = ay p + b, with a, b \u2208 R\u0304. a is invertible in R\u0304 and so, based on 1)\nand on the fact that U is normal, it is an invertible element of U . As any such element\nis an element of k, by passing to k\u0304, we can assume a = 1. So q is a Galois extension; but\nit is easy to see that this is not so. Contradiction. So 2) follows.\nExample 2 motivates why in all that follows we do not mention at all such truncations. However, the terminology of crystalline (elementary) n-admissible \u00e9tale covers used\nin B is motivated by the way we came across 3.6.8.1 and by such a possible reformulation.\nAS\nF. Definitions. Let \u03a0AS\n0 (R\u0304) (resp. \u03a0\u221e+1 (R\u0304)) be the trivial group (resp. the\nfundamental group of Spec(R\u0304)). The Artin\u2013Schreier dimension of R\u0304, denoted dAS (R\u0304),\nis the smallest number q \u2208 {0} \u222a N \u222a {\u221e} \u222a {\u221e + 1} such that \u03a0AS\nq (R\u0304) is the whole\nfundamental group of Spec(R\u0304).\n\nLet q \u2208 N \u222a {\u221e}. If the group \u03a0AS\nq (R\u0304) is trivial we say Spec(R\u0304) is weakly q-simply\nGAS\nconnected. If moreover \u03a0q (Spec(R)) itself is trivial, then we drop the word weakly.\nSimilarly, referring to D with Xp non-affine, if \u03a0GAS\n(Xk ) is trivial we say Xp is q-simply\nq\nconnected.\nG. Homework. Compute the level n Artin\u2013Schreier fundamental groups and the\nArtin\u2013Schreier dimensions of algebraic field extensions of Fp .\nH. Artin\u2013Schreier systems of equations in mixed characteristic. We do not\nstop to present here a full theory: we are just interested to point out the main idea. Let\nO be a DVR of mixed characteristic (0, p) and let k1 be its residue field. Let RO be an\nintegral, regular, faithfully flat, formally smooth O-algebra. We assume that the smallest\nopen subscheme of Spec(RO ) containing Spec(RO \u2297O k1 ) is Spec(RO ) itself. We situate\nourselves in the context of A above, with ci \u2208 RO and with Li having coefficients in\nRO , \u2200i \u2208 S(1, n). We assume the matrix of the coefficients of Li 's is invertible. Then,\nas usual, we get an \u00e9tale cover of Spec(RO ) (this is a consequence of the assumption on\nSpec(RO ), via the classical purity theorem of [SGA1, p. 275]). Imitating B we define\nthe level n Artin\u2013Schreier fundamental group \u03a0AS\nn (RO ) of RO , as well as their projective\nlimit, the Artin\u2013Schreier fundamental group \u03a0AS (RO ) of RO . Variant: we can define\n285\n\n\fthe level (n, m, l) Artin\u2013Schreier fundamental group \u03a0AS\nn,m,l (RO ) of RO . We do believe\nthat, in this way, one can learn a lot about Galois groups of number fields; this is our\nfirst (see [Va10] for the second) approach towards the understanding of finite quotients\nof such Galois groups.\nI. Artin\u2013Schreier systems of equations in unequal positive characteristic.\nThe last sentence of H above suggests treating the situation where we deal with a system\n(*) of equations as in A and whose matrix is invertible but over affine schemes which are\nof characteristic a prime l 6= p. The first thing to be done is to get criteria (using the\nclassical purity theorem) when such systems of equations (defining finite, flat schemes)\ndo define \u00e9tale covers.\nWe hope to come back in a future paper with the main (expected or known to be\ntrue) properties of these Artin\u2013Schreier fundamental groups and dimensions. We end by\nmentioning that we do believe that there is a deep connection between I, [Bu2] and the\ntheory of ordinary reductions of a proper, smooth scheme over a number field.\nWe come back to the starting context of 3.6.18.\n3.6.18.5. Theorem (the inducing property). The answer to the question Q is\nyes if any one of the following conditions is satisfied:\na) k = k\u0304;\nb) \u03a6R is of essentially additive type;\nc) the Newton polygon of (M, \u03c6) does not have either the slope 0 or the slope 1.\nProof: If a) holds, this is a consequence of 3.6.18.3.1 and 3.6.18.4.1. If b) or c)\nholds, then based on 3.6.18.4 B), there is a unique connection on the extension of C to\nW (k\u0304). Using Galois descent, due to its uniqueness it is obtained from a connection \u2207 on\nC by extension of scalars. So the Theorem follows from 3.6.18.3.1 and 3.6.18.4.1.\n3.6.18.5.1. Corollary. We assume \u03a6R is of essentially additive type. Then we\n\u2207\nhave an equivalence of categories between p \u2212 MF[0,1] (R) and p \u2212 MF[0,1]\n(R), and we\n\u22121\nhave an antiequivalence (via the D functor) of categories between these two categories\nand p \u2212 DG(Spec(R)).\nProof: For the equivalence part, from 3.6.18.4 (we have r = 0) we deduce that there\nis a unique way to associate to a p-divisible object C of MF[0,1](R) a p-divisible object\n\u2207\n(C, \u2207) of MF[0,1]\n(R). So we just need to check that this association is well behaved w.r.t.\nmorphisms between p-divisible objects.\nEverything boils down to (keeping the previous notations): if f \u2208 F 0 (End(M ))\u2297W (k)\nR is fixed by \u03a6, then it is annihilated by the (unique) connection \u2207 on M \u2297W (k) R for\nwhich \u03a6 is \u2207-parallel. Let \u2207(f ) = f1 \u2208 End(M ) \u2297W (k) \u03a9\u0304R/W (k) . It satisfies the equation\n(32)\n\nf1 = p\u03a6 \u25e6 d\u03a6R\u2217 /p(f1 ) = \u03a6 \u25e6 d\u03a6R\u2217 (f1 ).\n\nWe claim: f1 = 0. It is enough to show that f1 mod p is 0. Choosing an arbitrary\nW (k)-basis B of End(M ), by identifying the R/pR-coefficients of both sides of (32) w.r.t.\n286\n\n\fit and the R-basis dz1 ,..., dzm of \u03a9\u0304R/W (k) , we get a system of equations SE of first type\nin m dimW (k) (M )2 variables and with coefficients in R/pR. As in the proofs of 3.6.1.2\nand of 3.6.18.4 B), due to the fact that \u03a6R is of essentially additive type, we get: SE has\na unique solution; so f1 mod p is 0.\nThe antiequivalence part is implied by the equivalence part and by 3.6.18.5 b): we\ncan change the Frobenius lift \u03a6R (cf. [De3, (1.1.2.1)]) to one of additive type \u03a6R (zi ) = zip ;\nso Grothendieck\u2013Messing\u2013Berthelot's theory (see [Me, ch. 4-5] and [BM, ch. 4]) and [Fa2,\nth. 10] apply. In other words:\n\u2207\na) each p-divisible object of MF[0,1]\n(R) is associated to a (uniquely) p-divisible group\nover R (cf. 2.2.21 UP);\n\nb) this association is functorial and fully faithful (cf. [BM, ch. 4] and [Me, ch. 4-5]).\nThis ends the proof.\n3.6.18.5.2. Corollary (the liftability property). We assume that k = k\u0304 or that\n\u03a6R is of essentially additive type. Let n \u2208 N. Let C be an object of MF[0,1] (R) such\nthat we have an epimorphism e : C1 \u0589 C, with C1 as the truncation mod pn of some\np-divisible object of MF[0,1](R) (resp. let C be a p-divisible object of MF[0,1](R)). Then\nany connection \u2207 on C (resp. on C/pn C) can be lifted to a connection on C1 (resp. on\nC).\nIf \u03a6R is of essentially additive type, then such a lift is unique. If k = k\u0304 and we are\nin the context of e, then the number of such lifts is a non-negative, integral power of p.\nProof: We first consider the case of a p-divisible object C. The subcase k = k\u0304 is a\nconsequence of (the proof of) 3.6.18.4.2 b) and of 3.6.8.1.2 a). The subcase when \u03a6R is\nof essentially additive type is a consequence of 3.6.18.4 B).\nWe consider now the case of an object C. We follow closely the proof of 3.6.18.4.2.\nLet C = (M, F 1 , \u03c60 , \u03c61 ) and let C1 = (M1 , F11 , \u03c601 , \u03c611 ). Let q : M1 \u0589 M be the Repimorphism defining e. We view \u2207 as a connection \u22071 : M1 \u2192 M \u2297R \u03a9\u0304R/W (k) for which\ne is \u2207-parallel in the sense that we have\n(33)\n\n\u22071 \u25e6 \u03c611 (m) = \u03c60 \u25e6 d\u03a6R\u2217 /p \u25e6 \u22071 (m)\n\nif m \u2208 F11 , and\n(34)\n\n\u22071 \u25e6 \u03c601 (m) = p\u03c60 \u25e6 d\u03a6R\u2217 /p \u25e6 \u22071 (m)\n\n \u0303 : M1 \u2192 M1 \u2297R \u03a9\u0304R/W (k) making C1\nif m \u2208 M1 . So we need to lift \u22071 to a connection \u2207\n\u2207\nto be viewed as an object of MF[0,1](R).\nWe consider an R-basis B1 = {e1 , ..., es } of C1 as in the proof of 3.6.18.4.2. From\n[Fa1, 2.1 iii)] we get F 1 = q(F11 ). Using this we deduce (via standard induction on the\nlength of M1 /(z1 , ..., zm)M1 as a W (k)-module) that we can assume that the non-zero\nelements of the form q(ei ) are forming an R-basis of C. As M1 is a free R/pn R-module,\n287\n\n\fthe natural R-linear map End(M1 ) \u2192 Hom(M1 , M ) is an epimorphism. We consider its\nkernel N and the R/pn R-basis F1 = {f1 , ..., fs2 } of End(M1 ) defined, as in the proof of\n3.6.18.4.2, by B1 . Let \u22071 be an arbitrary lift of \u22071 to a connection on M1 .\nN is the underlying module of the object N of MF[\u22121,1](R) which is the kernel of\nthe natural epimorphism\nEnd(C1 ) \u0589 Hom(C1 , C).\nSo N has an R-basis formed by non-zero elements of the form pn(i) fi , where all n(i)'s\nbelong to S(0, n) and are uniquely determined by q. Let I0 be the set of those i's such\n \u0303 on M1 lifting \u22071 can be written in the\nthat n(i) \u2264 n \u2212 1. An arbitrary connection \u2207\nform\n(35)\n\n \u0303 = \u22071 +\n\u2207\n\nm\nXX\n\nxij pn(i) fi dzj ,\n\ni\u2208I0 j=1\n\n \u0303 makes C1 to be viewed as an object of MF \u2207 (R)\nwith all xij 's in R/pn R. The fact that \u2207\n[0,1]\ngets translated in m equalities between elements of N , i.e. in a system of equations SE\ninvolving the variables xij 's and their Frobenius transforms.\nSo we can follow entirely the proof of 3.6.18.4.2: by induction on l \u2208 S(1, n) we show\nthat we have a solution of the system of equations obtained from SE by working mod pl\n(i.e. of the system of equations we get by considering m equalities between elements of\nN/pl N ). But, as M1 is R-generated by \u03c601 (M1 ) and by \u03c611 (F11 ), as in 3.6.8 5) we get\nthat SE mod p is a system of equations of first type. So if k = k\u0304, 3.6.8.1 applies. If \u03a6R\nis of essentially additive type, then we can proceed as in 3.6.18.4 P2-3 to separate the\nvariables and to show that SE mod p has a unique solution. This takes care of the case\nl = 1. The same things apply when we move from things mod pl to things mod pl+1 ,\nl \u2208 S(1, n \u2212 1), cf. the proof of 3.6.18.4.2. As fi 's and zj 's are defined over R we can\nassume that all linear forms have coefficients in R/pR; this takes care (cf. 3.1.8.1.2 c))\nof the \"power of p\" part. This proves the Corollary.\n3.6.18.5.3. Corollary. We assume the Frobenius lift \u03a6R is of essentially additive\n\u2207\ntype. Then we have an equivalence of categories between MF[0,1] (R) and MF[0,1]\n(R)\n\u22121\nand we have an antiequivalence (via the D\nfunctor) of categories between these two\ncategories and p \u2212 F F (Spec(R)).\nProof: Any object C of MF[0,1](R) is the cokernel of an isogeny m12 : C1 \u0592\u2192 C2\nbetween two p-divisible objects of MF[0,1] (R) (cf. Fact of 2.2.1.1 6)). From 3.6.18.5.1\n(applied to m12 ) we get that there is a connection \u2207C on C. 3.6.18.5.2 (applied twice\nto the natural epimorphisms C2 \u0589 C2 /pn C2 \u0589 C, with n \u2208 N big enough) implies (via\n3.6.18.5.1) \u2207C is unique. So the equivalence part is obtained as in the proof of 3.6.18.5.1.\nFor the antiequivalence part, as we have 3.6.18.5.1, we just have to remark, besides\nthe reference to the Fact of 2.2.1.1 6), one extra thing. Any finite, flat, commutative\ngroup scheme GR over R of rank a power of p, is a closed subgroup of a p-divisible group\n288\n\n\fover R (cf. M. Raynaud's theorem of [BBM, 3.1.1]). So, based on standard techniques\npertaining to abelian categories (see 2.2.1.0 and 2.2.1.1 6)), the Corollary follows.\n3.6.18.5.4. Remarks. 1) It is easy to see that the results 3.6.18.5.1-3 extend to\na more general context, inspired from 3.6.18.4.2 (cf. also 3.6.18.4.4). We leave this to\nthe reader (to be compared with 3.6.18.8 below). In particular, one can state a moduli\nvariant of 3.6.18.5.2 following the pattern of 3.6.18.4.2: it is obtained by just putting\ntogether 3.6.18.4.2 and 3.6.18.5.2. We could think of it as an explicit form of particular\ncases of Raynaud's theorem mentioned above.\n2) 3.6.18.5.1 and 3.6.18.5.3 are the third place where we need p > 2.\n3) The condition k = k\u0304 of 3.6.18.4 (resp. of \u2013part of\u2013 3.6.18.5.2) can be weaken as\nfollows: we just need that Spec(k) is dimW (k) (M )2 -simply (resp. is |I0 |-simply) connected\n(see defs. 3.6.18.6 D). The same applies in other situations (for instance, in the proof of\n3.6.15 B, assuming that the base B exists, we just need k to be C-simply connected, with\nC as the maximum of the orders of all cycles C of \u03c0L with n(C) \u2265 0).\n3.6.18.5.5. The case of categories MF[a,b] (R). A natural question arises. What\nabout the categories MF[a,b] (R), with a, b \u2208 Z, b > a + 1? In what follows, if the reader\ndesires can assume a = 0.\nA. First of all, as in 3.2.3 and 3.1.1.1 we can speak about generic situations. The\nsecond philosophy of 3.6.18.2.1 says that it is enough to look at the case of such generic\nsituations. The conclusion is: due to reasons explained in 3.6.8.9, none of the results of\n3.6.18.4-5 remain true (in general), except one. We start explaining this exception.\nLet C = (MR , (F i (MR ))i\u2208S(a+1,b) , \u03a6MR ) be a p-divisible object of MF[a,b] (R). As\nin 3.6.18.1, for i \u2208 S(a, b), we define numbers f (i) \u2208 N \u222a {0} by the formula\nf (i) := dimR (F i (MR )/F i+1 (MR ))).\nWe assume k = k\u0304. By a generic situation modeled on C we mean (to be compared\nwith 3.6.18.2) that we are dealing with a p-divisible object\nC1 = (MR , (F i (MR ))i\u2208S(a+1,b) , \u03a61MR )\nof MF[a,b] (R) such that:\na) defining a p-divisible object C1W (k) := (M, (F i (M ))i\u2208S(a+1,b), \u03c61 ) of MF[a,b] (W (k))\nas in 3.6.18.0 (i.e. via the pull back of C1 through the Teichm\u00fcller lift Spec(W (k)) \u0592\u2192\nSpec(R)), there is a W (k)-basis {e1 , ..., edimW (k) (M )} of M for which we have \u03c6(ei ) =\np\u03b5i ei , with \u03b5i \u2208 S(a, b), and \u2200j \u2208 S(a + 1, b) the set of those ei 's such that \u03b5i \u2265 j is a\nW (k)-basis of F j (M );\nb) \u03a6R is of multiplicative type.\nWe have:\n289\n\n\fFact. The number of connections on C/pn C is at most\nPb\u22121\npnm i=a f (i)f (i+1) .\n\nMoreover this number is attained for some generic situations modeled on C.\nProof: Using the fact that we are dealing only with connections satisfying the Griffiths transversality condition, the first part of the Fact is a consequence of the constancy\nproperty of 3.6.8.9 and of the estimate of m1 in 3.6.8.9.0.\nFollowing the pattern of 3.6.18.2, we can write (via short exact sequences) C1 as\nextensions of p-divisible objects of MF[i,i] (R), where i \u2208 S(a, b) is such that f (i) 6= 0.\nSo, using induction on b \u2212 a, the first part of the Fact for C1 is as well a consequence of\n3.6.18.2. Here are the details. We can assume a = 0 and accordingly we write C1 as the\nextension of a p-divisible object C11 of MF[1,b] (R) by a p-divisible object of MF[0,0](R).\nThe number of connections on C1 /pn C1 is at most equal to the sum of the number of\nconnections on C11 /pn C11 and of the number of connections on C1<2 /pn C1<2 , where C1<2\nis the maximal p-divisible subobject of C1 which is a p-divisible object of MF[0,1](R);\nmoreover, the equality holds if \u03a61M takes F 1 (MR ) into itself.\nSo if C1 is a direct sum of p-divisible objects of MF[i,i] (R), for various i \u2208 S(0, b),\nPb\u22121\nnm\nf (i)f (i+1)\n1\nn 1\ni=a\nthen the number of connections on C /p C is (by induction) precisely p\n.\nThis ends the proof.\nBut if m \u2265 2 and if the sum\nb\u22122\nX\n\nf (i)f (i + 1)f (i + 2)\n\ni=a\n\nis not 0, not all of them are integrable; this creates problems as well as beauty. Obviously,\nif f (i)f (i + 1)f (i + 2) = 0, \u2200i \u2208 S(a, b \u2212 2), then all these connections are integrable.\nWe now assume \u03a6R (zl +1) = (zl +1)p , \u2200l \u2208 S(1, m). Let F\u0303 i (M ), i \u2208 S(a, b), be direct\nsummands of M as in 2.2.1 c). We can assume we have an identity MR = M \u2297W (k) R\nsuch that F i (MR ) is nothing else but the direct sum \u2295j\u2265i F\u0303 j (M ) \u2297W (k) R. We also\nassume \u03b5i \u2265 \u03b5i\u2032 , if i \u2265 i\u2032 , i, i\u2032 \u2208 S(1, dimW (k) (M )). Let gR \u2208 Ker(GL(MR ) \u2192 GL(M ))\nbe defined as in 3.6.18.0 but for C1 . Let\nN (n, m, f (a), f (a + 1), ..., f (b), gR)\nbe the number of integrable connections on C1 /pn C1 .\nWe consider the maximal subgroup NR\u22121 (resp. NR\u22122 ) of GL(MR ) with the property\nthat its R-valued points are those R-linear automorphisms nR of MR having the property:\n1MR \u2212 nR takes F\u0303 i (M ) into F\u0303 i\u22121 (M ) \u2297W (k) R (resp. into F\u0303 i\u22122 (M )), \u2200i \u2208 S(a, b). It is\na smooth, unipotent, connected subgroup and its relative dimension is\nb\u22121\nX\n\nf (i)f (i + 1)\n\ni=a\n\n290\n\n\fPb\u22122\n\u22121\n(resp. is i=a f (i)f (i + 2)). NR1 is the extension from W (k) to R of a subgroup NW\n(k)\nof GL(M ). From the proof of the above Fact we get: we can assume\n\u22121\ngR \u2208 Ker(NW (k)\u22121 (R) \u2192 NW\n(k) (W (k))).\n\nWe consider connections \u2207 on MR of the following particular form\n\u2207=\u03b4+\n\nX\n\nxl dzl ,\n\nl\u2208S(m)\n\nwith xl \u2208 Lie(NR\u22121 ) and with \u03b4 the connection on MR that annihilates M . We choose\narbitrarily an R-basis B\u22122 of\nLIE\u22122 := Lie(NR\u22121 ) \u2295 Lie(NR\u22122 ).\nWorking as usual modulo powers of p, the systems of equations needed to be satisfied by:\n\u2013 (the coefficients of) a connection on MR /pn MR lifting a fixed connection on\n\u2207\nMR /pn\u22121 MR which makes C1 /pn\u22121 C1 potentially to be viewed as an object of MF[a,b]\n(R)\n1 n 1\n(here n \u2208 N), in order to be on C /p C ,\nexpress the equality between two elements of LIE\u22122 \u2297R \u03a9\u2227\nR/W (k) ; identifying the coefficients of these two elements w.r.t. the R-basis of LIE\u22122 \u2297R \u03a9\u2227\nR/W (k) defined naturally\n\u2227\nby B2 and by the R-basis of {dz1 , ..., dzm } of \u03a9R/W (k) , we get systems of equations of\nthird type (with coefficients in R/pR). Warning: we do need to consider LIE\u22122 and not\njust Lie(NR\u22121 ) and this is why we do not get in general systems of equations of first type.\nHowever, we can still study to some extend such numbers N (n, m, f (a), f (a +\n1), ..., f (b), gR) following the pattern of 3.6.18.4.1 of algebraizing things (via Chinese\nReminder Theorem and work performed modulo r-powers of maximal ideals, r \u2208 N),\ncf. D below. But, based on (24) of 3.6.18.2, it is easy to see that such numbers\n\u22121\n\u22121\nN (n, m, f (a), f (a + 1), ..., f (b), gR) do depend on gR \u2208 Ker(NW\n(k) (R) \u2192 NW (k) (W (k))).\nFor instance, if (n, m, a, b) = (1, 2, 0, 2) then\nN (1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1MR ) = (p \u2212 1)3 + (2p \u2212 1)2\nis the number of quadruples (q1 , ..., q4 ) formed by elements of Z/pZ and such that q1 q2 =\nq3 q4 (this can be easily read out from (24) of 3.6.18.2); but there are many values of\ngR for which we have N (1, 2, 1, 1, 1, gR) = 0. This suggests the introduction of types of\ngeneric situations (modeled on C). Not to be too long, we propose here only one such\ntype.\nDefinition. The generic situation C1 is said to be authentic if N (n, m, f (a), f (a +\n1), ..., f (b), gR) > 0.\n291\n\n\fDespite the fact that none of the other results of 3.6.18.4-5 remain true in general\nfor C, many of them have weaker forms, which are also very useful. We explain them one\nby one.\nB. We start with a general definition. We come back to the general case, i.e. we\nare not any more in the context of a generic situation. Let CW (k) be defined as in a) but\nstarting from C.\nDefinitions. We assume b \u2265 a + 1 and k = k\u0304. Let i \u2208 S(a, b). The dimension of\nthe Fp -vector subspace\nVi (CW (k) ) := {x \u2208 F i (M )/pF i (M )|\u03c6i (x) = x}\nof F i (M )/pF i (M ), with \u03c6i : F i (M ) \u2192 M as the \u03c3-linear map obtained from \u03c6 as in\n2.2.1 c) (we still denote by \u03c6i its reduction mod p), is called the pseudo-multiplicity of\nthe slope i of CW (k) (or of C in the maximal point of Spec(R)). Let Si (CW (k) ) be the\nZp -submodule of M formed by elements fixed by p\u2212i \u03c6. Let\nWi (CW (k) ) := Vi (CW (k) ) \u2229 Si (CW (k) )/pSi (CW (k) ),\nthe intersection being taken inside M/pM . dimFp (Wi (CW (k) )) is called the virtual pseudomultiplicity of the slope i of CW (k) (or of C in the maximal point of Spec(R)). Similarly,\nif X is as in 2.2.1 c) and if CX is an object (resp. a p-divisible object) of MF[a,b] (X)\nwe define the pseudo-multiplicity (resp. the pseudo-multiplicity and the virtual pseudomultiplicity) of the slope i of CX in a geometric point of Spec(Xk ).\nWarning: in general the (virtual) pseudo-multiplicities and the multiplicities of the\nslope i \u2208 S(a, b) do not coincide. However, they do coincide if i \u2208 {a, b} (for instance, if\nb = a + 1 they always coincide).\nWe come back to the initial assumption b > a + 1, with k arbitrary. The role of\ns(0)s(1) in 3.6.18.4 B) has to be replaced by the pseudo-multiplicity spm (\u22121) of the slope\n\u22121 of the extension of End(CW (k) ) to k\u0304. As in the proof of 3.6.18.4 (see P7 of it), we get\nthe following improvement of the first part of the Fact of A:\nCorollary. The number CONN(C, n) of connections on C/pn C is at most\npnrspm (\u22121) .\nThis Corollary is a particular case of 3.6.18.7.1 b) below (and so, as it is not used\nbelow, we refer to the mentioned place). Even if k = k\u0304 it can happen that actually we\nhave less than predicted such connections. To construct such examples with gR as the\ntrivial element, we just need to consider cases when Vi (End(CW (k))) has dimension 1\nover Fp and Wi (End(CW (k))) = {0}: the proof of 3.6.18.7.1 b) below shows that if in the\nCorollary we have equality \u2200n \u2208 N, then each connection counted by CONN(C, n) lifts to\na connection on C; so we can follow 3.6.18.4 P6-7 to get that, under the assumptions on\nthe ranks of Vi (End(CW (k) )) and of Wi (End(CW (k) )), CONN(C, 1) has at most 1 element.\n292\n\n\fExample. We consider a W (k)-basis {x, y, z} of a free W (k)-module M\u0303 of rank\n3 and define: \u03c6\u0303(px) = x + py, \u03c6\u0303(p3 y) = z and \u03c6\u0303(z) = p3 y. We take F 0 (M\u0303 ) =\nF 3 (M\u0303 ) =< z >, F \u22121 (M\u0303 ) = F \u22122 (M\u0303 ) =< x, z >, and F \u22123 (M\u0303 ) = M\u0303 . Let C\u0303W (k) :=\n(M\u0303 , (F i (M\u0303 )i\u2208S(\u22123,3) ), \u03c6\u0303). Its slopes are 0, 0 and \u22121, its pseudo-multiplicity of the slope\n\u22121 is 1 but there are no a1 , a2 \u2208 W (k) such that p\u03c6\u0303(x + a1 y + a2 z) = x + a1 y + a2 z.\nSo Wi (C\u0303W (k) ) = {0}. We take C to be the pull back to Spec(R) of the direct sum\nC\u0303W (k) \u2295 W (k)(0). End(C) has the pull back to Spec(R) of C\u0303W (k) as a direct summand.\nWe get (as in 3.6.18.4 P6-7) that there is only one connection on M/pM \u2297k R/pR, with\nM := M\u0303 \u2295 W (k), which lifts to a connection on M \u2297W (k) R making C potentially to\n\u2207\nbe viewed as a p-divisible object of MF[\u22123,3]\n(R), even if r 6= 0: it is the connection\nannihilating M/pM .\nWe do not know when there is a constant f (C) \u2208 N \u222a {0} such that CONN(C, n) =\n, \u2200n \u2208 N. Warning: in general there is no such constant f (C).\n\nnf (C)\n\np\n\nC. Similarly we define the number INT(C, n) counting the connections of B which are\nmoreover integrable. It seems to us that we always have INT(C, n) = N (n, m, f (a), f (a +\n\u22121\n\u22121\n1), ..., f (b), gR) for some gR \u2208 Ker(NW\n(k) (R) \u2192 NW (k) (W (k))); warning: we do not\nknow how to prove this using the ideas of A and of the proof of 3.6.18.4.1. However, the\nmentioned ideas give us (it is an easy exercise, cf. also D below):\nPb\u22121\nCorollary. Let q \u2208 N. If CONN(C, n) = pnm i=a f (i)f (i+1) , then INT(C, n) \u2265\n\u22121\nq\nN (n, m, f (a), f (a + 1), ..., f (b), gR), for some gR \u2208 NW\n(k) (R) which mod (z1 , ..., zm ) is\nthe identity element.\nIt seems to us (based on the Corollary of B), that in the above Corollary we are\nactually in the context of a generic situation.\nD. 3.6.18.4.2 has a weaker version. We use its notations but replacing the lower right\nindex [0, 1] everywhere by [a, b]. For m \u2265 2 we have two moduli p-adic formal schemes:\nM (C) of integrable connections and M1 (C) of connections; this is a consequence of 3.6.8.9\nA1. Always we have an open closed natural embedding\nM (C) \u0592\u2192 M1 (C)\nof formally \u00e9tale, p-adic formal schemes over S \u2227 . But we can not say anything about\ntheir fibres. In particular they can be empty. Also, in case of an object, there is no a\npriori reason (besides 3.6.8.9.0) to always have all non-empty fibres having a number of\nelements which is a power of p.\nE. In accordance to D, if M1 (C) or M (C) is not empty and the special fibre of S is\nnoetherian and connected, then the surjectivity principle of 3.6.18.4.5 is preserved for it.\nIn the same context, the purity result of 3.6.8.1.4, the touching property of 3.6.18.4.3,\nand the surjectivity principle of 3.6.18.6 b) below are preserved. All these can be read\nout from their proofs and from 3.6.8.9 A1.\n293\n\n\fF. The inducing property is a much subtler thing, as it can happen to have\nINT(C, n) = 0 for some n \u2208 N (see end of A). We do not know any simple and sufficiently general criterion which could guarantee that INT(C, n) \u2265 1, \u2200n \u2208 N.\n3.6.18.5.6. Problem. With the notations of 3.6.18.0-2, if r \u2265 1, study the behavior\nof connections (obtained as in 3.6.18.4 and 3.6.18.4.2) w.r.t. (short) exact sequences of\nobjects of MF[0,1] (R). Hint: look at the proofs of 3.6.18.5.2-3.\nThe similar problem in the context of 3.6.18.5.5 is much harder.\n3.6.18.5.7. A variant. Using 3.6.18.5 c) instead of 3.6.18.5 b), we obtain logical\nvariants of 3.6.18.5.1 and 3.6.18.5.3. We state these variants, in a language inspired from\n3.6.18.5.5 B and so suitable for future generalizations. Regardless of how \u03a6R and k are,\nwe have:\nCorollary. The full subcategory of p \u2212 F F (Spec(R)) (resp. of p \u2212 DG(Spec(R)))\nwhose objects are such that either their \u00e9tale part or their multiplicative type part is trivial,\nis antiequivalent (via the D functor) to the full subcategory spm (\u22121) = 0 \u2212 MF[0,1](R)\n(resp. spm (\u22121) = 0 \u2212 p \u2212 MF[0,1](R)) of the category MF[0,1](R) (resp. of the category\np \u2212 MF[0,1] (R)) whose objects are having the pseudo-multiplicity of the slope \u22121 of the\nEnd objects of their truncations mod p equal to 0. Moreover, spm (\u22121) = 0 \u2212 MF[0,1](R)\n(resp. spm (\u22121) = 0\u2212p\u2212MF[0,1](R)) is equivalent to the similarly defined full subcategory\n\u2207\n\u2207\n\u2207\nspm (\u22121) = 0 \u2212 MF[0,1]\n(R) (resp. spm (\u22121) = 0 \u2212 p \u2212 MF[0,1]\n(R)) of MF[0,1]\n(R) (resp.\n\u2207\nof p \u2212 MF[0,1]\n(R)).\nProof: The proof of 2.2.1.1 6) shows that any object of MF[0,1](R) has a strict lift\nin the sense of 2.2.1 e); so any object of spm (\u22121) = 0 \u2212 MF[0,1] (R) is the epimorphism of\nan isogeny between two objects of spm (\u22121) = 0 \u2212 p \u2212 MF[0,1] (R). So, copying the proofs\nof 3.6.18.5.1 and 3.6.18.5.3, we just have to deal with the part involving morphisms, in\nthe context of p-divisible objects and groups. But over Spec(R), there is no non-trivial\nhomomorphism from a finite, flat, commutative group scheme G1 of p-power order whose\npull back to Spec(Rsh ) is connected into a finite, \u00e9tale, commutative group scheme G2 of\np-power order; moreover, as p \u2265 3, there is no non-trivial homomorphism G2 \u2192 G1 . So,\nall morphisms between (p-divisible) objects to be considered are such that (the proof of)\n3.6.18.4 c) applies to get that all elements f1 as in the proof of 3.6.18.5.1 are 0.\n3.6.18.5.7 is part of the third place where we need p \u2265 3.\n3.6.18.5.8. An equivalence of categories. Let S be as in 3.6.18.4.2. As in\n3.6.18.5.7 we define the categories spm (\u22121) = 0 \u2212 MF[0,1](S), spm (\u22121) = 0 \u2212 p \u2212\n\u2207\n\u2207\nMF[0,1](S), spm (\u22121) = 0\u2212MF[0,1]\n(S), spm (\u22121) = 0\u2212p\u2212MF[0,1]\n(S). By just combining\n3.6.18.4.2, 3.6.18.5 c) and 3.6.18.5.7 we get:\nCorollary. The category spm (\u22121) = 0 \u2212 MF[0,1] (S) (resp. spm (\u22121) = 0 \u2212 p \u2212\n\u2207\nMF[0,1](S)) is naturally equivalent to the category spm (\u22121) = 0 \u2212 MF[0,1]\n(S) (resp. to\n\u2207\nspm (\u22121) = 0 \u2212 p \u2212 MF[0,1]\n(S)).\n294\n\n\f3.6.18.5.9. A formula. We refer to the morphism e of 3.6.18.5.2, in the case k = k\u0304.\nFollowing the proofs of 3.6.18.5.2 and 3.6.18.4 B), we get that the number of lifts of \u2207\n\u2207\nto connections making C1 to be viewed as an object of MF[0,1]\n(R) is precisely\nr\n\np\n\nPn\u22121\ni=0\n\nai\n\n,\n\nwhere ai is the pseudo-multiplicity of the slope \u22121 of pi N/pi+1 N (in the maximal point\nof Spec(R)). Here N is as in the proof of 3.6.18.5.2. As pi+1 N/pi+2 N is naturally a\nsubobject of pi N/pi+1 N, we have:\na0 \u2265 a1 \u2265 ... \u2265 an\u22121 .\nFor future references, we state here a combined version of 3.6.1.3 and 3.6.18.4.2.\n3.6.18.6. Theorem. Let Spec(R1 ) be a regular, formally smooth, affine W (k)scheme. We assume that its special fibre is connected and that it is part of a triple\n(Spec(R1 ), \u03a6R1 , z) defining a potential-deformation sheet. Let C1 be a p-divisible object\nof MF[0,1] (R1 ).\na) (the universal global \u2207 principle for MF[0,1](\u2217) for potential-deformation\nsheet contexts) The whole of 3.6.1.3 remains true (except the fact that we get connections respecting the G-action which does not make any sense here) in this context, provided\nwe state the things in terms of p-adic formal schemes. In particular, there is a moduli\np-adic formal scheme M0 (C1 ) having a geometrically connected special fibre and there is a\nformally \u00e9tale, affine morphism d1 : M0 (C1 ) \u2192 Spec(R1\u2227 ) such that d\u22171 (C1 ) is a p-divisible\n\u2207\nobject of MF[0,1]\n(M0 (C1 )) and which are universal in the following sense:\nUP For any formally \u00e9tale, p-adic formal scheme X over Spec(R1\u2227 ) such that all\nconnected components of its special fibre contain points mapping into the special fibre zk\n\u2207\nof z and the pull back CX\n1 of C1 to it is a p-divisible object of MF[0,1] (X), there is a\n\u2217\nunique Spec(R1\u2227 )-morphism lX : X \u2192 M0 (C1 ) (so CX\n1 is (d1 \u25e6 lX ) C1 ).\nThe special fibre of d1 is an N-pro-\u00e9tale, affine morphism. Moreover, the point\nz lifts uniquely to a point Spf(W (k)) \u2192 M0 (C1 ). If the underlying module of C1 is\nfree, then d1 is defined naturally by the p-adic completion of an N-pro-\u00e9tale morphism\nl1 : Spec(Q1 ) \u2192 Spec(R1 ).\nb) (the surjectivity principle) The fibres of d1 over an open subscheme of the\nspecial fibre of Spec(R1\u2227 ) containing zk , are not empty.\nThe same remains true for objects: we just need to replace the words N-pro-\u00e9tale by\nthe word \u00e9tale (b) becomes trivial). If R1 /pR1 is of finite type over k, then M0 (C1 )k is\nan AG k-scheme.\nThe proof of this is entirely the same as the proof of 3.6.1.3 (cf. 3.6.18.4.1 for the\nintegrability part), and so it is omitted. We just mention two things. The localization\nprocess mentioned in the proof of 3.6.18.4.2, allows us to assume that we are in the\n295\n\n\fcontext described in the last sentence of a). M0 (C1 ) is the (only) connected component\nof the moduli p-adic formal scheme M (C1 ) of 3.6.18.4.2 to which y lifts.\n3.6.18.7. The relative situation. 3.6.18.4-6 works in the relative context, i.e.\nwhen we start with a Shimura filtered \u03c3-crystal or, even more generally, with a suitable\nfiltered \u03c3-S-crystal over k. So here, with the notations of the opening paragraphs of\n3.6.18, we assume that there is a smooth subgroup G\u0303 of GL(M ) having connected fibres\nand the property that there is a family of tensors (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J of the F 0 -filtration of T (M [ p1 ])\ndefined by F 1 such that \u03c6(t\u03b1 ) = t\u03b1 , \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 J , and G\u0303B(k) is the subgroup of GL(M [ p1 ])\nfixing t\u03b1 , \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 J . Till the end of 3.6.18.7.1 we assume k = k\u0304. We have:\nTheorem. If gR \u2208 G\u0303(R), then there is an integrable connection \u2207 on M \u2297W (k) R,\nwhich respects the G\u0303-action (in the similar sense as of 3.6.1.1.1) and makes C to be viewed\n\u2207\nas a p-divisible object of MF[0,1]\n(R). Moreover, this p-divisible object is induced from a\n \u0303 (it is defined as in 2.2.10).\nfiltered F -S-crystal of the form (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G\u0303, f)\nProof: This is a consequence of 3.6.18.4.1 and [Fa2, rm. iii) after th. 10] (to be\ncompared with 3.6.18.3.1), once we show that there is a connection on M \u2297W (k) R which\n\u2207\nmakes C to be viewed as a p-divisible object of MF[0,1]\n(R) and which respects the G\u0303action. To see this, following the ideas of the steps 4) to 7), 11) and 12) of 3.6.8, we\nget that it is enough to show that there is a connection on M \u2297W (k) R/pR which makes\n\u2207\nC/pC to be viewed as an object of MF[0,1]\n(R) and which respects the G\u0303-action (i.e. the\nliftability property of 3.6.18.5.2 works also in this relative context pertaining to filtered\n\u03c3-S-crystals: this can be deduced from the way the paragraph below is presented).\nWe start with a connection \u2207 = \u03b40 +\u03b2, where \u03b40 is the connection on M \u2297W (k) R/pR\nannihilating M and where\n\u03b2 \u2208 LIE := Lie(G\u0303) \u2297W (k) \u03a9(R/pR)/k .\nThe equations (E1 ) and (E2 ) of 3.6.1.1.1 2), in this case (as \u03a6(t\u03b1 ) = t\u03b1 , \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 J ), express\nfor each l \u2208 S(M ) the equality between two elements of LIE: this can be read out from\n3.6.8.6.1-2 (cf. also 2.2.1.2). So we get a system of m dimW (k) ((Lie(G\u0303)) equations in\nthe same number of variables; the resulting system of equations is of first type and so\n3.6.8.1.2 a) applies. This ends the proof of the Theorem.\nWarning: not all connections on C/pC respect the G\u0303-action; simple examples can be\nconstructed starting from the generic situation described in 3.6.18.2. However, for n \u2208 N,\nwe have:\n3.6.18.7.0. Formulas. The number of connections on M \u2297W (k) R/pn R that respect\n\u2207\nthe G\u0303-action and make C/pn C to be viewed as an object of MF[0,1]\n(R) is p to the power\nnr times the number s(\u22121) of slopes \u22121 of the Lie \u03c3-crystal (Lie(G\u0303), \u03c6). Each such\nconnection lifts in precisely prs(\u22121) ways to a connection on M \u2297W (k) R/pn+1 R respecting\n\u2207\nthe G\u0303-action and making C/pn+1 C to be viewed as an object of MF[0,1]\n(R).\n296\n\n\fThe proof of this is entirely the same as the proof of 3.6.18.4 B).\n3.6.18.7.1. Formulas and estimates (the general form). We refer to the\nfiltered \u03c3-S-crystal of 3.6.1.5. Choosing an element gR \u2208 G\u0303(R), let\nC := (M\u0303 \u2297W (k) R, (F i (M\u0303 ) \u2297W (k) R)i\u2208S(\u00e3+1,b\u0303) , gR (\u03c6\u0303 \u2297 1)).\nIt is a p-divisible object of MF[\u00e3,b\u0303] (R). We have:\nTheorem. a) If \u00e3 = 0 and b\u0303 = 1, then 3.6.18.7.0 still holds in this general context.\nb) In general, the number of connections on M \u2297W (k) R/pn R which respect the\n\u2207\nG\u0303-action and make C/pn C potentially to be viewed as an object of MF[\u00e3,\n(R) is at\nb\u0303]\nmost equal to pnrspm (\u22121) , where spm (\u22121) is the pseudo-multiplicity of the slope \u22121 of\n(Lie(G\u0303), (F i (Lie(G\u0303)))i\u2208SS(\u00e3,b\u0303) , \u03c6\u0303).\nc) We assume the filtration of Lie(G\u0303) is in the range [\u22121, 1]. Then in b) we have\nequality.\nProof: Let d \u0303 := m dimW (k) (F \u22121 (Lie(G\u0303))). All systems and subsystems of equations\nto be considered below are in d \u0303 variables and have coefficients in R/pR. For b) we just\nneed to show: for any i \u2208 S(0, n \u2212 1), every connection \u22070 on M\u0303 \u2297W (k) R/pi R respecting\n\u2207\nthe G\u0303-action and making C/pi C potentially to be viewed as an object of MF[\u00e3,\n(R), can\nb\u0303]\nbe lifted in at most prspm (\u22121) ways to a connection on M\u0303 \u2297W (k) R/pi+1 R having the\nproperties:\ni) it respects the G\u0303-action, and\n\u2207\nii) it makes C/pi+1 C potentially to be viewed as an object of MF[\u00e3,\n(R).\nb\u0303]\nWe first remark that, as in 3.6.8.9, we can \"capture\" the fact that a connection \u2207\non M\u0303 \u2297W (k) R/pi+1 R lifting \u22070 satisfies i) and ii), by using a system of equations SE of\nthird type. We consider their subsystems which are of first type (see 3.6.8.9 A1). To be\nmore precise, for instance, we can choose an R-basis B of M\u0303 such that suitable subbases\nof it are W (k)-bases of its direct summands F i (M\u0303 ), i \u2208 S(a, b). Using it we put SE in\na convenient matrix form as in 3.6.8.6 (CMF) (see also 3.6.8.6.1) and we consider just\nthe subsystem defined by entries which correspond to the direct summand F \u22121 (Lie(G\u0303))\nof End(M\u0303 ). So the choice of B gives birth naturally to a direct supplement DS of\nF \u22121 (Lie(G\u0303)) in End(M\u0303 ) and we \"view\" our systems of equations \"modulo it\" (strictly\nspeaking modulo DS \u2297W (k) \u03a9\u2227\nR/W (k) ). However, in what follows, it is important to allow\nsuch a direct supplement to be arbitrary (i.e. to vary) and in particular, not necessarily\nto be defined by a W (k)-basis of M\u0303 ; let SDS be the set of such DS's. Let \u03c0DS be the\nreduction mod p of the projector of End(M\u0303 ) on F \u22121 (Lie(G\u0303)) having DS as its kernel.\nSo for any i \u2208 S(0, n \u2212 1) and for each such DS \u2208 SDS we obtain (via the projection\n\u2227\n\u22121\n(Lie(G)) \u2297W (k) \u03a9\u2227\nof End(M\u0303 ) \u2297W (k) \u03a9\u2227\nR/W (k) \"along\" DS \u2297W (k) \u03a9R/W (k) )\nR/W (k) on F\na subsystem SSDS (i) of SE formed by precisely d \u0303 equations; it is of first type and it is\nuniquely determined up to equivalence.\n297\n\n\fFrom 3.6.8.9 A1 and 3.6.8.1.2 c), as R/pR is strictly henselian, we get that the\nnumber SOLDS of solutions of SSDS (i) is independent on i and n; so in what follows we\njust write SSDS instead of SSDS (i). Obviously, the number of lifts of \u22070 as above (i.e.\nwhich have properties i) and ii)) is at most pSOLDS .\nSo, as these subsystems of equations are of first type, we can follow entirely the proof\nof 3.6.18.4 B) (see P1 to P3 and P7 of it): SOLDS is equal to p to the power r times the\ni\npseudo-multiplicity sDS\npm (\u22121) of the slope \u22121 of (Lie(G\u0303), (F (Lie(G\u0303)))i\u2208SS(\u00e3,b\u0303) , \u03c6\u0303) \"along\nDS\". In other words, sDS\npm (\u22121) is the dimension of the Fp -vector space\nDS\nV\u22121\n(C) := {x \u2208 F \u22121 (Lie(G\u0303))/pF \u22121 (Lie(G\u0303))|\u03c0DS \u25e6 \u03c6\u0303\u22121 (x) = x},\n\nwhere \u03c6\u0303\u22121 is (the reduction mod p of) the \u03c3-linear map F \u22121 (End(M\u0303 )) \u2192 End(M\u0303 )\ndefined as in 2.2.1 c) by p\u03c6\u0303 (see (ENDFR) of 2.2.4 B). As we are allowed to vary DS, we\njut need to remark:\n(36)\n\nspm (\u22121) = min{sDS\npm (\u22121)|DS \u2208 SDS}.\n\n0\nTo prove this formula, let DS0 \u2208 SSD be such that sDS\npm (\u22121) attains the above minimum.\nDS0\nLet {e1 , ..., eq\u0303 } be an Fp -basis of V\u22121\n(C), and let {e1 , ..., edimW (k) (F \u22121 (Lie(G\u0303))) } be a k-\n\nbasis of F \u22121 (Lie(G\u0303))/pF \u22121 (Lie(G\u0303)) w.r.t. which \u03c0DS0 \u25e6 \u03c6\u0303\u22121 has an upper triangular\n0\nform. Obviously, sDS\npm (\u22121) = q\u0303 \u2265 spm (\u22121). If q\u0303 > spm (\u22121), then there is j \u2208 S(1, q\u0303)\nsuch that \u03c6\u0303\u22121 (ej ) = ej + fj , with fj \u2208 DS0 a non-zero element. We can assume j = 1.\n2\nLet {f1 , ..., fdim\nReplacing DS0 by\n\u22121 (Lie(G\u0303))) } be a k-basis of DS0 .\nW (k) (M\u0303 ) \u2212dimW (k) (F\nanother\nDS1 \u2208 SDS\nsuch that \u03c0DS1 is the sum of \u03c0DS0 with the k-linear endomorphism of End(M\u0303 /pM\u0303 ) which\nannihilates all eu 's (u \u2208 S(1, dimW (k) (F \u22121 (Lie(G\u0303))))) and all fs 's (s \u2208 S(2, dimW (k) (M\u0303 )))\nDS0\n1\nand which takes f1 into \u2212e1 , we get sDS\npm (\u22121) \u2264 \u22121 + spm (\u22121). Contradiction. This\nproves (36), and so b).\nFor a) and c), let LIE be as in 3.6.18.7. To show that equality holds if \u00e3 = 0 and\nb\u0303 = 1, we just have to show that in fact the systems of equations of third type we come\nacross are in fact of first type.\nLet N0 be the Zariski closure of the connected component of the origin of the subgroup of GL(M\u0303 [ p1 ]) normalizing Lie(G\u0303)[ p1 ] in GL(M\u0303 ). So N0 normalizes G\u0303. The canonical\nsplit cocharacter \u03bc\u0303 : Gm \u2192 GL(M\u0303 ) of (M\u0303 , F 1 (M\u0303\u0001 ), \u03c6\u0303) factors through N0 , cf. our assumptions of 3.6.1.5. So we can write \u03c6\u0303 = \u00e3\u03bc\u0303 1p , with \u00e3 as a \u03c3-linear automorphism\nof M\u0303 , normalizing Lie(G\u0303). But 3.6.8.6.1-2 can be entirely adapted to this \"normalizing\"\ncontext, so that 3.6.8.6.1-2 apply as in 3.6.18.7: the systems of equations we get are\nexpressing the equality between two elements of LIE and so, as C is a p-divisible object\nof MF[0,1] (W (k)), they are of first type. This proves a).\n298\n\n\fThe proof of c) is entirely the same as the proof of a). We just have to remark\nthat (GT) of 3.6.1.1 4) represents no restrictions on \u03b2 (i.e. writing \u2207 = \u22070 + \u03b2,\nwith \u22070 a fixed connection on M\u0303 \u2297W (k) R/pn+1 R lifting \u22070 , \u03b2 \u2208 pm Lie(G\u0303) \u2297W (k)\nm+1\n\u03a9\u2227\nLie(G\u0303) \u2297W (k) \u03a9\u2227\n \u0303\ninvolves as many coefficients \u2013viewed as elR/W (k) /p\nR/W (k) \u2192LIE\nements of R/pR\u2013 as dimR/pR (LIE)); so the fact that \u2207 is a connection on C/pn+1 C\ngets translated in: these coefficients are solutions of a quasi Artin\u2013Schreier system of\nequations in as many variables as dimR/pR (LIE). This ends the proof.\nWe now combine 3.6.18.7.1 with a variant of 3.6.18.5.9. Let a, b and R have the\nsame significance as in 3.6.18.5.5. Let C be an arbitrary object of MF[a,b] (R)[pn ]. Let\nspm (\u22121, C)\nbe the pseudo-multiplicity of the slope \u22121 of\ni\ni+1\n\u2295n\u22121\nEnd(C).\ni=0 p End(C)/p\n\n3.6.18.7.1.1. Corollary. a) We assume (a, b) = (0, 1). The number of connections\non C is precisely prspm (\u22121,C) .\nb) We do not make any assumption on a and b. The number of connections on C is\nat most prspm (\u22121,C) .\na) follows by combining the part of the proof of 3.6.18.4.2 referring to extra features\nwith the proof of 3.6.18.7.1. b) follows from the proof of 3.6.18.7.1 b). The only difference\nfrom this proof: when we start lifting connections \"pertaining to\" End(C)/pi End(C) to\nconnections \"pertaining to\" End(C)/pi+1 End(C) (see the proof of 3.6.18.4.2), we come\nacross systems of equations in a potentially less number of variables and so we are dealing\nwith the pseudo-multiplicity of the slope \u22121 of pi End(C)/pi+1 End(C) (and not just of\nEnd(C)/pEnd(C)).\n3.6.18.7.2. Relative forms of 3.6.18.4.6. We come back to the starting setting of\n3.6.18.7. It is worth detailing what 3.6.18.4.6 becomes in the relative context. There are\ntwo variants: one modeled on the faithful representation \u03c1 of G\u0303k on M/pM and another\none modeled on (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G\u0303). We first detail the first one and then we hint the idea of\nthe second one.\nLet m\u0303 := dimW (k) (M ). Let R\u0304 be a k-algebra such that Spec(R\u0304) is connected. In the\nproof of 3.6.18.4.6 C we came across Artin\u2013Schreier systems of equations in n variables\n(n \u2208 N) with coefficients in R\u0304, whose n \u00d7 n matrix AL is invertible (i.e. AL \u2208 GLn (R\u0304)).\nIf now m\u0303 = n and AL \u2208 G\u0303k (R\u0304) (under the representation \u03c1), then we say that the Artin\u2013\nSchreier system (*) of equations of 3.6.18.4.6 A is modeled on \u03c1, and any open closed\nsubscheme of the Spec(R\u0304)-scheme defined by it is said to be a crystalline elementary\n\u03c1-admissible \u00e9tale cover of Spec(R\u0304). As in 3.6.18.4.6 we define crystalline \u03c1-admissible\n\u00e9tale covers of Spec(R\u0304), as well as Galois groups\n\u03c1\u2212AS\n\u03a0m\u0303,m\n\n299\n\n\fand\n\n\u03c1\u2212AS\n,\n\u03a0m\u0303\n\nby using only Artin\u2013Schreier systems of equations which are modeled on \u03c1. Here m \u2208 N\n\u03c1\u2212AS\nwe consider sequences\nhas the same role as in 3.6.18.4.6 B, i.e. in the definition of \u03a0m\u0303,m\nof crystalline \u03c1-admissible \u00e9tale covers of length at most m. Warning: all Artin\u2013Schreier\n\u03c1\u2212AS\n(resp.\nsystems of equations modeled on \u03c1 are in precisely m\u0303 variables. We refer to \u03a0m\u0303\n\u03c1\u2212AS\nto \u03a0m\u0303,m ) as the \u03c1 (resp. as the level m \u03c1) Artin\u2013Schreier fundamental group of Spec(R\u0304)\n(the lower right index m\u0303 just has the role of keeping track of the dimension of the faithful\nrepresentation \u03c1). Similarly, following the pattern of 3.6.18.4.6, we can define (using\nin 3.6.18.4.6 D just matrices Ai 's and Bij 's which are defined by points of G\u0303k ) for any\nseparated, connected k-scheme Xp :\n(Xp );\n\u2013 a \u03c1 Galois\u2013Artin\u2013Schreier fundamental group \u03a0\u03c1\u2212GAS\nm\u0303\n\u03c1\u2212GAS\n(Xp ).\n\u2013 a level m \u03c1 Galois\u2013Artin\u2013Schreier fundamental group \u03a0m\u0303,m\n\nThe most interesting cases are when \u03c1 is an irreducible representation. For instance,\nwe would like to understand the case when \u03c1 is the spinorial (resp. semi-spinorial)\nrepresentation of a split semisimple group over k of Bl (resp. of Dl ) Lie type, with\nl \u2208 N, l \u2265 3 (resp. l \u2265 4). As in 3.6.18.6 F, we define the notion of (weakly) \u03c1-simply\nconnectivity.\nThe second variant imitates the first variant as well as the case described in the\nequations (3) and (4) of 3.6.8; in other words, we require that some specific entries of\nAL are 0, without requiring that AL is invertible or that it defines an element of G\u0303k .\nWe intend to come back in a future paper to detail this second variant, as we think it is\nequally important as the first one.\n3.6.18.7.3. The relative moduli principle. Let X be a regular, formally smooth,\nfaithfully flat W (k)-scheme equipped with a Frobenius lift \u03a6X and having a connected\nspecial fibre. We consider a p-divisible object C of MF[a,b] (X) and a family of tensors\n(t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J of the essential tensor algebra of the underlying OX \u2227 -sheaf F of C such that\nthere is an open, affine cover of X with the property that for any member U = Spec(R)\nof it whose special fibre is non-empty, denoting by \u03a6U the Frobenius lift of U \u2227 naturally\ndefined by \u03a6X and denoting by (MR , (F i (MR ))i\u2208S(a,b) , \u03a6MR ) the pull back of C to U \u2227\n(so MR is a projective R\u2227 -module), the mentioned sections become sections (we keep the\nsame notation) of T (MR ) satisfying:\ni) they are in the F 0 -filtration of T (MR ) defined by (F i (MR ))i\u2208S(a,b) and are fixed\nby \u03a6MR ;\nii) the Zariski closure of the subgroup of GL(MR [ p1 ]) fixing t\u03b1 , \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 J , in GL(MR )\nis a reductive group G\u0303R over R\u2227 .\nThe intersection F i (Lie(GR )) := F i (End(MR )) \u2229 Lie(GR ) is a direct summand of\nLie(GR ), i = 0, 1. The argument for this is entirely the same as the one of the first\nparagraph of the proof of 2.2.20.1 9).\n300\n\n\fUsing Teichm\u00fcller lifts Spec(W (k\u0303)) \u2192 Spec(R\u2227 ), with k\u0303 a perfect field containing k,\nand applying 2.2.1.2 to the context of pull backs of (C, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J via them, we get that (the\npull back) of F 0 (Lie(GR )) through eacg geometric point of Spec(R/pR) or dominating\nSpec(R\u2227 [ p1 ]) is the Lie subalgebra of a parabolic subgroup of (the corresponding pull\nbacks of GR ). Even better, we have:\nA. Claim. F 0 (Lie(GR )) is the Lie algebra of a uniquely determined parabolic subgroup PR of GR . F 1 (Lie(GR )) is the Lie algebra of the unipotent radical of PR .\nProof: The second part follows from the first part, via pull backs through Teichm\u00fcller lifts as above. The uniqueness of PR follows from the Fact of 2.2.11.1.\nTo see that PR exists, we start remarking that we have a natural identification\nLie(Gad ) = {x \u2208 End(Lie(GR ))|pn x \u2208 ad(Lie(GR )), for some n \u2208 N}.\nSo Lie(Gad ) can be interpreted as well as the underlying R\u2227 -module of the kernel (see\n2.2.1.1 6)) of a morphism between p-divisible objects of MF (R). So we similarly get di1\nad\nad\nrect summands F 0 (Lie(Gad\nR )) and F (Lie(GR )) of Lie(GR ). As above, in each geometric\npoint of Spec(R) factoring trough a Teichm\u00fcller lift, F 0 (Lie(Gad\nR )) becomes the Lie algebra of a parabolic subgroup of (the corresponding pull back of Gad\nR ) whose unipotent\n1\nradical has as its Lie algebra the corresponding pull back of F (Lie(Gad\nR )); in particular,\nthis applies to all geometric points of Spec(R/pR).\nad\nAs F 0 (Lie(Gad\nR )) is a direct summand of Lie(GR ), we can speak about the subgroup\nad\nN of GR normalizing it. We now check that NR/pR is a parabolic subgroup of Gad\nR/pR\n0\nad\n0\nad\nhaving F (Lie(GR ))/pF (Lie(GR )) as its Lie algebra.\n\nWe first assume R = W (k). We consider a maximal torus TW (k) of the parabolic\n0\nad\nad\nsubgroup P S of Gad\nW (k) whose Lie algebra is F (Lie(GW (k) )). It acts on Lie(GW (k) via\ninner conjugation. Let F \u22121 be the opposite of F 1 (Lie(Gad\nW (k) )) w.r.t. this action. As we\n\u22121\nare in an adjoint context, TW (k) acts on F\nthrough characters which are not multiples\nby elements of N \\ {1} of characters of TW (k) ; so no element of F \u22121 /pF \u22121 can take\nLie(Tk ) into Lie(P Sk ). So Lie(Nk ) = Lie(P Sk ). As Nk contains P Sk , we have (see Fact\nof 2.2.11.1) Nk = P Sk .\nWe come back to the general R. Using Teichm\u00fcller lifts we get that all fibres of\nNR/pR are parabolic subgroups and so are smooth and connected; they also have the\nsame dimension. We get: NR/pR is smooth (using translations, it is enough to check that\nNR/pR is smooth in the origins of its fibres; but the argument for this is the same as the\none of the second paragraph after [Va2, Claim 1 of p. 463]) and so a parabolic subgroup\nof GR/pR . Based on this on the fact that each point of Spec(R) specializes to a point of\nSpec(R/pR), we get that all fibres of N are smooth and have the same dimension. This\nimplies: N is smooth in all points of the connected component of the origin of any one of\nits fibres. So, as each point of Spec(R) specializes to a point of Spec(R/pR), we get that\nall such fibres are connected and so N is smooth. Using Teichm\u00fcller lifts, we get that its\nLie algebra is F 0 (Lie(Gad\nR )).\n301\n\n\fAs N is a smooth subgroup of Gad\nR , as NR/pR is a parabolic subgroup of GR/pR , and\nas each point of Spec(R) specializes to a point of Spec(R/pR), N is a parabolic subgroup\nad\nof Gad\nR . Argument: we can assume that N contains a maximal torus TR of GR which\nis split, cf. [SGA3, Vol. III, 6.1 of p. 32]; as the set of characters of the action of TR\non Lie(N ) can be read out mod p, all fibres of NR[ p1 ] are \u2013cf. [Bo2, 7.1, 14.17-18 and\n. So the inverse image of N\n11.16]\u2013 parabolic subgroups of corresponding fibres of Gad\nR[ 1 ]\np\n\nunder the natural epimorphism GR \u0589 Gad\nR is a parabolic subgroup PR of GR . Using\nTeichm\u00fcller lifts, we get: its Lie algebra is F 0 (Lie(GR )). This ends the proof.\nLet now G be the reductive group over X \u2227 obtained by gluing naturally these reductive groups GR . Let P be the parabolic subgroup of G obtained by gluing naturally\nthese parabolic subgroups PR . Here reductive group (resp. parabolic subgroup) is understood in the following sense: G (resp. P) is a p-adic formal group scheme (resp. formal\nsubgroup scheme of G) over X \u2227 such that GWm (k) (resp. PWm (k) ) is a reductive group\nscheme over XWm (k) (resp. is a parabolic subgroup of GWm (k) ), \u2200m \u2208 N.\nMR\n\nLemma. Locally in the \u00e9tale topology of Spec(R) the filtration (F i (MR ))i\u2208S(a,b) of\nis defined (as in 2.2.8 c')) by a cocharacter \u03bcR of GR .\n\nProof: We can assume PR is split, cf. [SGA3, Vol. III, 6.1 of p. 32]. Let m1 :\nSpec(W (k1 )) \u2192 X be a Teichm\u00fcller lift whose special fibre is a dominant geometric point\nof Spec(R/pR); so m1 is as well a dominant morphisms. The filtration of MR \u2297R W (k1 ) is\ndefined (as in 2.2.8 c')) by a cocharacter of P\u0303W (k1 ) . As we can replace such a cocharacter\nby any P (W (k1 ))-conjugate of it, we can assume that it is obtained from a cocharacter\n\u03bcR of PR by pull back. If MR = \u2295i\u2208S(a,b) F\u0303Ri is the direct sum decomposition defined (as\nin 2.2.8 c')) by \u03bcR , then we have FRi = \u2295bj=i F\u0303 j (MR ), as this holds after tensorization\nwith W (k1 ). This ends the proof.\nProposition. There is an N-pro-\u00e9tale morphism f1 : Spec(R1 ) \u2192 Spec(R), surjective mod p, and such that there is a connection \u03b4R1 on MR \u2297R\u2227 R1\u2227 annihilating t\u03b1 ,\n\u2200\u03b1 \u2208 J .\nProof: We can assume \u03bcR exists. We write \u03a6MR = gR \u03bcR ( p1 ), with gR a \u03a6U -linear\nautomorphism of MR fixing t\u03b1 , \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 J . We can assume MR is a free R\u2227 -module. The\nequation\n(EQ)\n\n\u03a6MR (x) = x,\n\nwith x \u2208 MR , mod p defines a system of equations of first type with coefficients in R/pR\nwhose matrix is invertible. By passing (as usual) from things mod pm to things mod\npm+1 , m \u2208 N, we come across again on a system of equations of first type whose matrix\nis not changed. So from end of 3.6.8.1.0 and from 3.6.8.1.2 a) (to be compared with\nthe proof of 3.6.1.3) we deduce the existence of f1 of the type mentioned such that the\nZp -module MZp of solutions of (EQ) in MR \u2297R\u2227 R1\u2227 is such that the natural R1\u2227 -linear\nmap MZp \u2297Zp R1\u2227 \u2192 MR \u2297R\u2227 R1\u2227 is an isomorphism. So MZp defines a Zp -structure of\n302\n\n\fMR \u2297R\u2227 R1\u2227 ; with respect to it we have t\u03b1 \u2208 T (MZp ), \u2200 \u2208 J . So we can take as \u03b4R1 the\nconnection on MR \u2297R\u2227 R1\u2227 annihilating MZp . This ends the proof.\nB. Definitions. We say a connection \u2207 on F respects the G-action, if \u2207(t\u03b1 ) = 0,\n\u2200\u03b1 \u2208 J . We say a connection on F /pn F making C/pn C potentially to be viewed as\n\u2207\nan object of MF[a,b]\n(X) respects the G-action, if locally in the N-pro-\u00e9tale topology of\nX, it lifts to a connection on F which makes C potentially to be viewed as a p-divisible\n\u2207\nobject of MF[a,b]\n(X) and which respects the G-action. Similarly, we define connections\nrespecting the G-action, for pull backs of C or of C/pn C.\nC. Theorem (the relative form of the moduli principle). We assume the\nfiltration of Lie(GR ) is in the range [\u22121, 1]. Then there is a moduli p-adic formal scheme\nMG (C/pn C) (resp. MG (C)) of connections on pull backs of F /pn F (resp. of F ) through\nformally \u00e9tale, p-adic formal schemes over X \u2227 , which make the extension of C/pn C (resp.\nof C) to such a p-adic formal scheme X1 over X \u2227 potentially to be viewed as an object\n\u2207\n(resp. as a p-divisible object) of MF[0,1]\n(X1 ) and which respect the G-action. Moreover,\nwe have:\na) \u2200m \u2208 N, the XWm (k) -scheme MG (C/pn C)Wm (k) (resp. MG (C)Wm (k) ) is \u00e9tale and\naffine (resp. is N-pro-\u00e9tale and affine);\nb) Locally in the \u00e9tale topology of Xk , the special fibre of MG (C/pn C) (resp. of\nMG (C)) is obtained through a finite sequence (resp. an infinite sequence indexed by N) of\nsystems of equations of first type defined using linear homogeneous forms with coefficients\nin (the ring of global sections of the original \u2013i.e. before localization\u2013) Xk ;\nc) The fibres of MG (C/pn C)k (resp. of MG (C)k ) over points with values in fields of\nXk are non-empty. The fibres of MG (C/pn C)k are \u00e9tale schemes over fields defined by\nalgebras of dimension (as vector spaces over these fields) a non-negative, integral power\nof p.\nProof: Let m : X1 \u2192 X be a formally \u00e9tale morphism, with X1 a p-adic formal\nscheme. We first assume that (a, b) = (0, 1). The fact that a connection on M :=\n(m\u2227 ) \u2217 (F ) respects the G-action, is expressed through some algebraic equations. So as\nMG (C) (resp. as MG (C/pn C)) we can take the maximal open closed, formal subscheme of\nthe moduli p-adic formal scheme M (C) (resp. M (C/pn C)) constructed in 3.6.18.4.2, over\nwhich we get connections respecting the G-action (resp. which is the image of MG (C) in\nM (C/pn C) under the natural X \u2227 -morphism M (C) \u2192 M (C/pn C)). This takes care of the\nexistence part, as well as of a).\nb) follows from 3.6.18.7: in the mentioned place we used, cf. 3.6.8.6.1 (and end of\n3.6.18.7.1), the fact that the direct sum decomposition M = F 1 \u2295 F 0 is defined (as in\n2.2.8 c)) by a cocharacter of G\u0303 and that \u03b40 exists (i.e. and that we can introduce \u03b2).\nBut working in the N-pro-\u00e9tale topology of X \u2227 , the Lemma and the Proposition of A\ntake care of the existence of a corresponding cocharacter \u03bcR of GR and respectively of a\nconnection \u03b4R1 substituting \u03b40 .\nc) results from b) (cf. 3.6.8.1 applied in the context of geometric points of Xk ). This\nhandles the case (a, b) = (0, 1).\n303\n\n\fThe general case is entirely the same. The only difference comes from the fact that\nwe can not appeal to 3.6.18.4.2 and so we have to argue slightly differently the existence\nof MG (C/pn C) (resp. of MG (C)). Due to the universal property implicit in the moduli\naspect of MG (C/pn C) (resp. of MG (C)) and due to the affineness part of a), using descent\nwe can work locally in the \u00e9tale (resp. N-pro-\u00e9tale) topology of X. So we can assume\nthat X = Spec(R) is affine, that the filtration of F is defined by cocharacters of G, that\n\u03a9Xk /k is a free OXk -sheaf, that F is a free OX \u2227 -sheaf and that we have \u2013to be compared\nwith the last proof of A\u2013 a Zp /pn Zp -structure (resp. Zp -structure) of F /pn F (resp. of F )\nformed by elements fixed by \u03a6MR . Once we have this, the proof of 3.6.18.7.1 c) implies\nthat we can construct MG (C/pn C) (resp. of MG (C)) following the pattern of 3.6.18.4.2:\n\u2013 defining MG (C/C) to be X, MG (C/pn C)k is obtained from MG (C/pn\u22121 C)k using a\nquasi Artin\u2013Schreier system of equations;\n\u2013 MG (C/pn C) is the p-adic completion of the affine, \u00e9tale MG (C/pn\u22121 C)-scheme whose\nspecial fibre is the MG (C/pn\u22121 C)k -scheme MG (C/pn C)k ;\n\u2013 MG (C) is the p-adic completion of the N-projective limit of MG (C/pn C)'s.\nThis ends the proof.\n3.6.18.7.4. Comments. 1) We do not know how to compute the number of\nconnected components of MG (C/pn C).\n2) We do not know when in 3.6.18.7.3 b) we can work just in the Zariski topology\nof Xk .\n3) We do not know when MG (C/pn C) is X-algebraizable, i.e. is obtained from an\n\u00e9tale X-scheme X1 by taking the p-adic completion. If such an X1 exists, then we have a\nuniversal property for the morphism X1 \u2192 X involving formally \u00e9tale X-schemes, similar\nto the one of iii) of 3.6.1.3 1).\n4) We have variants of 3.6.18.7.3 (and of 1) to 3)): for instance, we allow X to be\na p-adic formal scheme or we work in the context of 3.6.18.7.0 or of 3.6.18.7.1 a) (the\nexistence of P in the last two contexts can be deduced as well from [Fa2, rm. iii) after\nth. 10]).\nTill end of 3.6.18.10 we work with a regular, formally smooth, affine W (k)-scheme\nSpec(R1 ) such that Y1 := Spec(R1 /pR1 ) is a connected scheme. We fix a Frobenius lift\n\u03a6R1 of R1\u2227 . Let a, b \u2208 Z, with a \u2264 b. 3.6.18.8-10 below can be stated as well in a\nnon a priori affine context; however, as their essence \"boils down\" to an affine context,\nthey are stated just in this last context. The following two theorems are consequences of\n3.6.18.7.1.1 b). However, for the sake of future references and due to their importance,\nthey are as well stated separately, with arguments.\n3.6.18.8. Theorem (the universal uniqueness principle). We assume there is\na maximal ideal mR1 of R1 such that R1 /mR1 is a finite field and the resulting Frobenius\nc1 of R1 w.r.t. is of essentially additive type. Then for any (plift of the completion R\ndivisible) object C1 of MF[a,b] (R1 ), there is at most one connection on it. So a \u2212 p \u2212\n\u2207\nMF[a,b]\n(R1 ) is a full subcategory of a \u2212 p \u2212 MF[a,b] (R1 ).\n304\n\n\fThe proof of the first part of the Theorem is the same as the proof of 3.6.1.2 (cf. also\nthe extra features of the proof of 3.6.18.4.2): we work inductively modulo pn , n \u2208 N. The\ndifference from 3.6.8 6) is that we need to apply the same upper triangular trick used in\nc1 ) for \"separating\" the variables. The case\n3.6.18.4 P2 (for the resulting Frobenius lift of R\nof p-divisible objects is also a consequence of Corollary of 3.6.18.5.5 B. As in the proof of\n\u2207\n3.6.18.5.1 we get that a \u2212 p \u2212 MF[a,b]\n(R1 ) is a full subcategory of a \u2212 p \u2212 MF[a,b] (R1 ).\n3.6.18.8.1. Theorem (the universal slope type uniqueness principle). Let\nm1 : Spec(W (k1 )) \u2192 Spec(R1 ) be a \u03a6R1 -Teichm\u00fcller lift, with k1 an algebraic field\nextension of k.\na) Let C1 be a p-divisible object of MF[0,1](R1 ) such that m\u22171 (C1 ) does not have\nslope 0 or slope 1. Then for any object (or p-divisible object) C\u20321 of MF[0,1](R1 ) whose\ntruncation mod p is isomorphic to C1 /pC1 , there is at most one connection on it.\nb) Let C1 be a p-divisible object of MF[a,b] (R1 ) such that End(m\u22171 (C1 )) has the\npseudo-multiplicity of the slope \u22121 equal to 0. Then for any object (or p-divisible object)\nC\u20321 of MF[a,b] (R1 ) whose truncation mod p is isomorphic to C1 /pC1 , there is at most one\nconnection on it.\nProof: The part of a) involving p-divisible objects is a consequence of the formula\nof 3.6.18.4 B). It is convenient to view the part of a) referring to objects as a particular\ncase of b). Now b) is a consequence of 3.6.8.9 (cf. 3.6.18.5.5) and of the proofs of 3.6.18.4\nB) and of 3.6.18.4.2. In other words, based on 3.6.18.5.5 D, the proofs of 3.6.18.4 B) and\nof 3.6.18.4.2 can be entirely adapted to the context of C1 . We just need to remark: the\nfact that End(m\u22171 (C1 )) has the pseudo-multiplicity of the slope \u22121 equal to 0, can be\nread out from its truncation T mod p; so what we know for T remains true for all its\nsubobjects. This proves the Theorem.\n3.6.18.8.2. Examples. We refer to 3.6.18.6. As usual we can speak about the\np-rank of C1 /pC1 at any maximal (or geometric) point of Spec(R1 /pR1 ). The p-rank is\n0 in such a point y iff the F -crystal we get (by pulling back C1 via a Teichm\u00fcller lift\nof Spec(R1 ) whose special fibre factors through y) does not have slope 0. So if C1 has\np-rank 0 w.r.t. any maximal point of Spec(R1 /pR1 ), then in the construction of M (C1 )k\nwe do not need to pass to N-pro-\u00e9tale covers (or in the case of an object to \u00e9tale covers):\nwe have M0 (C1 ) = M (C1 ) = Spf(R1\u2227 ), i.e. d1 mod p is an isomorphism (cf. 3.6.18.5.8).\nSimilarly, we can \"detect\" the multiplicity of the slope 1 of C at a geometric point\nof Spec(R1 /pR1 ) by just looking at C1 /pC1 : it is equal to the p-rank of (C/pC)\u2217 (1) at\nthe point. So, similarly, if C1 has slope 1 with multiplicity 0 at any maximal point of\nSpec(R1 /pR1 ), then M (C1 ) = Spf(R1\u2227 ).\n3.6.18.8.3. Some variants. 3.6.1.2-3 remain true for any Frobenius lift \u03a6Rj of\nRj\u2227 such that \u03a6R\u03020 is of essentially additive type (cf. 3.6.18.4 B); see also 3.6.18.5.1 and\nj\n\n3.4.18.7.0). This gives us more freedom. To exemplify it, we assume we are in a context\nin which 3.6.8.4 5) applies, i.e. we automatically have Spec(Q0,n /pQ0,n ) = S n , regardless\nof the choices involved; for instance, this is the case if the G-ordinary type defined by\n305\n\n\f(M, \u03c6, G) has no slope 0 or no slope 1, as in this case S n = Spec(R0 /pR0 ), \u2200n \u2208 N (cf.\n3.6.18.8.2). In such a context, we can always adjust the things (in a way similar to the\nalgebraization process of the proof of 3.6.18.4.1) so that in 3.6.2 we \"end up\" over k, i.e.\nthe W (k)-morphisms of 3.6.2.1 b) and c) do exist without the three assumptions of the\nbeginning paragraph of 3.6.2.1 (that k = k\u0304, etc.).\nFor an arbitrary Frobenius lift \u03a6Rj of Rj\u2227 , we lose the uniqueness part, so 3.6.1.2-3\nhave to be modified to a significant extend (for instance not all connections we get respect\nthe G-action, l\u22121\nj,n (Zk ) is not necessarily Spec(k), etc.). We do not stop to rewrite what\nremains true out of 3.6.1.2-3, in this general context. We just point out that we still\nhave a universal property w.r.t. connections respecting the G-action (cf. 3.6.18.7.3 C),\nbut the corresponding p-adically complete moduli Rj\u2227 -schemes, can (theoretically) have\nnon-connected special fibres.\nMoreover, 3.6.18.6 has a similar version, in which we work with an arbitrary Frobenius lift \u03a6R1 and we are not in the context of a potential-deformation sheet.\n3.6.18.9. Global estimates. We assume that for any reduced, closed subscheme\nof Y1 , its k\u0304-valued points are dense in it. Let C be an object of MF[0,1](R1 ). We denote\nby \u2207(C) the number of connections on C.\nLet y \u2208 Y1 (k\u0304). Let ry \u2208 N \u222a {0} be the rank (see 3.6.18.1) of the Frobenius lift of\nthe completion of R1 w.r.t. its maximal ideal defining the point of Y1 through which y\nfactors, defined naturally by \u03a6R1 .\nClaim. The values of ry 's achieve a stratification S of Yk in reduced, locally closed\nsubschemes in such a way that under specialization of strata, their values decrease. S\nsatisfies the purity property.\nProof: We consider a p-divisible group over R1 which is a direct sum of Qp /Zp and\n\u2207\nof its dual. We apply 3.6.18.4.2 in the context of the p-divisible object of MF[0,1]\n(R1 )\nassociated to it. So the Claim follows from 3.6.18.4 B) and 3.6.8.1.3-4.\nAs in 3.6.18.1 we associate to C/pC (and y) numbers sy (0), sy (1) \u2208 N \u222a {0}. Let\nn \u2208 N \u222a {0} be the smallest number such that pn annihilates C. Let\ndy (C) := nry sy (0)sy (1).\nFrom 3.6.18.4 B) and the extra features of the proof of 3.6.18.4.2 we get:\n(EST 1)\n\n\u2207(C) \u2264 min{dy (C)|y \u2208 Y1 (k\u0304)}.\n\nWe have:\nFact. If the number ry sy (0)sy (1) does not depend on y \u2208 Y1 (k\u0304) and if the underlying\nmodule of C is a projective R1 /pn R1 -module, then the special fibre of the moduli formal\nscheme M (C) (of 3.6.18.4.2) is an \u00e9tale cover of Y1 . Moreover, if ry sy (0)sy (1) 6= 0, then\neach one of the numbers ry , sy (0) and respectively sy (1) independently do not depend on\ny \u2208 Y1 (k\u0304).\n306\n\n\fProof: The first part follows from 3.6.18.4 B), 3.6.18.4.2, 3.6.8.1.2 a) and standard\nproperties on the number of points of geometric fibres of an \u00e9tale, affine morphism (see\n[EGA IV, 15.5.9]). The second part follows using specialization and generic arguments\n(cf. the above Claim for ry 's). This ends the proof.\nLet now C be an object of MF[a,b] (R1 ). Let n be as above. Let sypm (\u22121, C) be the\npseudo-multiplicity of the slope \u22121 of the following object of MF[a,b] (R1 )\nn\u22121\nX\n\npi End(C)/pi+1 End(C).\n\ni=0\n\nFrom 3.6.18.7.1.1 b) we get\n(EST 2)\n\nlogp (\u2207(C)) \u2264 min{ry sypm (\u22121, C)|y \u2208 Y1 (k\u0304)}.\n\nFrom 3.6.18.7.1.1 a) and loc. cit. we also get:\nCorollary. We assume b = a + 1 = 1. The products ry sypm (\u22121, C) do not depend\non y \u2208 Y1 (k\u0304) iff the special fibre of the moduli formal scheme M (C) (of 3.6.18.4.2) is an\n\u00e9tale cover of Y1 .\n3.6.18.10. p-divisible objects of bounded \u2207-deviations. We assume Y1 has\nthe ALP property. Let C be a p-divisible object of MF[0,1] (R1 ). We say C is of bounded\n(resp. of totally bounded) \u2207-deviation if at least one connected component (resp. if all\nconnected components) of the special fibre of M (C) is (resp. are) of finite type over Y1 .\nThe interesting cases are when Y1 is of finite type over k or when R1 = W (k)[[z1 , ..., zm ]],\nwith k 6= k\u0304. Plenty of examples of p-divisible objects of bounded \u2207-deviation can be\nobtained following the strategy of modifications of 3.6.8.9.1. Similarly, using 3.6.18.89, we get plenty of examples of p-divisible objects of totally bounded \u2207-deviation; for\ninstance, C is of totally bounded deviation if C/pC has p-rank 0 at all k\u0304-valued point of\nY1 . Two problems are dear to us.\nP1. In the interesting cases mentioned above, determine all p-divisible objects of\nbounded \u2207-deviation.\nP2. Determine conditions under which, in the case when R1 is a smooth W (k)\u2207\nalgebra, a p-divisible object of MF[0,1]\n(R1 ) is such that:\na) it is associated to a p-divisible group over R1 (and not only \u2013see 2.2.1.1 2)\u2013 to one\nover R1\u2227 ), or\nb) when viewed as an object of MF[0,1](R1 ), it is of totally bounded \u2207-deviation.\n3.6.19. The gluing principle. 3.6.14 and 3.6.14.1 are particular cases of a more\ngeneral principle pertaining to Shimura p-divisible groups, which we call the gluing principle. However, we singled them out, as they are in the context of abelian varieties, are\nthe most important cases needed in applications, and moreover we had to give a preliminary motivation for the Expectation of 3.6.15 A. In what follows we present different\nforms of the gluing principle.\n307\n\n\fA. Let Spec(Ri\u2227 ) be the p-adic completion of a pro-\u00e9tale, affine scheme Spec(Ri )\nover a smooth, affine W (k)-scheme, i \u2208 1, 2. Let z i : Spec(W (k)) \u2192 Spec(Ri ), and let\nD i = (Di , (ti\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J )\nbe a Shimura p-divisible group over Spec(Ri\u2227 ). We still denote by z i the p-adic completion\nof z i . We assume that:\ni) the two Shimura p-divisible groups z1\u2217 (D 1 ) and z2\u2217 (D 2 ) over W (k) are isomorphic;\nii) the relative dimension d1 of Spec(R1 ) in z 1 is greater or equal to the relative\ndimension d2 of Spec(R2 ) in z 2 ; moreover D i is a versal deformation in z i , i = 1, 2;\niii) Spec(Ri /pRi ) is a connected k-scheme, i = 1, 2.\nHere the versality condition of ii) is defined as follows.\nB. Definitions. Let X be a regular, formally smooth W (k)-scheme. A Shimura\np-divisible group DX over X is said to be a versal (resp. uni plus versal) deformation in a\nclosed point yX : Spec(k1 ) \u0592\u2192 X, with k1 an algebraic field extension of k, if the dimension\nof the image of the Kodaira\u2013Spencer map attached to DX (and so computed relative to\nW (k)) in this point (resp. if this map is injective and the mentioned dimension) is equal\nto the deformation dimension of the (non-necessarily quasi-split) Shimura \u03c3k1 -crystal of\n\u2217\nyX\n(DX ).\nWe assume now that Xk has the ALP property. We say DX is a versal (resp. uni\nplus versal) deformation if it is a versal (resp. uni plus versal) deformation in all closed\npoints yX as above.\nAn object or a p-divisible object of MF \u2207 (X) is said to be a uni plus quasi-versal\ndeformation in a closed point yX as above (resp., assuming that Xk has the ALP property,\nis said to be a uni plus quasi-versal deformation), if the Kodaira\u2013Spencer map in yX (resp.\nin each point yX as above) is injective.\nSimilarly, assuming that Xk has the ALP property, an object or a p-divisible object\nof MF \u2207 (X) is said to be a quasi-versal deformation if the Kodaira\u2013Spencer map in\neach point yX as above has an image whose dimension depends only on the connected\ncomponent of Xk to which yX belongs. Similarly, we define Shimura p-divisible groups\nover X which are (uni plus) quasi-versal deformations.\nC. If Di has a principal quasi-polarization PDi , i = 1, 2, then we say that we are in\na principally quasi-polarized context; if we are in such a context then we assume that the\nisomorphism of i) respects the principal quasi-polarizations involved.\nD. Let (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G) be the Shimura filtered \u03c3-crystal associated to the two Shimura\nc1 ) (resp. Spec(R1h )) be the\np-divisible groups over W (k) obtained in i). Let Spec(R\n1\ncompletion of Spec(R ) (resp. be the henselization of Spec(R1 )) in z 1 . We still denote by\nci ) or of Spec(Rih ). We assume the existence\nz i the resulting W (k)-valued point of Spec(R\nof a formally smooth W (k)-morphism\nc1 ) \u2192 Spec(R2\u2227 )\nf12 : Spec(R\n308\n\n\fsuch that:\nR1) f12 \u25e6 z 1 = z 2 ;\nc1 /pR\nc1 is contained in R1h /pR1h ;\nR2) the image of R2 /pR2 in R\n\n\u2217\nc1 ) \u2192\nR3) f12\n(D 2 ) is isomorphic to the pull back of D 1 through the natural morphism Spec(R\n1\u2227\nSpec(R ), through an isomorphism lifting the one of i).\n\nWe also assume that:\nEXTRA) For any formally smooth W (k)-morphism f \u030312 : Spec(R\u03031\u2227 ) \u2192 Spec(R2\u2227 ), with\nSpec(R\u03031 ) a pro-\u00e9tale, affine scheme over Spec(R1 ) such that z1 has a lift z\u03031 with\nc1\nthe properties that f \u030312 \u25e6 z\u03031 = z2 and the objects with tensors of p \u2212 M\u2207\n[0,1] (R ) defined by f \u0303\u2217 (D 2 ) and D 1\nare isomorphic under an isomorphism lifting (in z\u03031 )\n12\n\nSpec(R\u03031\u2227 )\n\nthe one of i) but viewed in the non-filtered context, after replacing R\u03031 by an \u00e9tale,\naffine scheme over it to which z\u03031 lifts we can modify f \u030312 by something which is 0 mod\n\u2217\n1\np so that f \u030312\n(D 2 )) and DSpec(\nthemselves are isomorphic under an isomorphism\nR\u03031\u2227 )\nlifting (in z\u03031 ) the one of i).\nFollowing the proofs of 2.3.15 and 3.6.14.1 we can state (cf. also 3.6.2.2):\nTheorem (the gluing principle: the global form). There is an affine W (k)scheme Spec(R3 ), with R3\u2227 = R3 , and there is a formally \u00e9tale W (k)-morphism\nq1 : Spec(R3 ) \u2192 Spec(R1\u2227 ) and a formally smooth W (k)-morphism q2 : Spec(R3 ) \u2192\nSpec(R2\u2227 ), such that for a suitable W (k)-morphism a3 : Spec(W (k)) \u2192 Spec(R3 ) we\nhave:\na) qi \u25e6 a3 = z i , i = 1, 2;\nb) q1\u2217 (D 1 ) is isomorphic to q2\u2217 (D 2 ) through an isomorphism lifting (cf. a)) the one\nof i);\nc) Spec(R3 /pR3 ) is connected and a pro-\u00e9tale scheme over a smooth, affine k-scheme.\nIf Ri is a smooth W (k)-algebra, i = 1, 2, then we can also assume that:\nd) the image of Spec(R3 /pR3 ) in Spec(R3\u2212i /pR3\u2212i ) contains an open, dense subscheme of it.\nProof: The proof of this Theorem is contained in the proof 3.6.14.1. We need to\nadd just two extra things. First, [BLR, th. 12 of p. 83] applies entirely (as in 3.6.14.1\nE), due to standard arguments on projective systems as in [EGA IV, \u00a78]; one can quote\nas well b) of the following general Fact (for X = Spec(Ri )).\nFact. a) Let Y be a quasi-compact, quasi-separated, regular, formally smooth W (k)scheme. If X is a projective limit of \u00e9tale, affine Y -schemes X\u03b1 , \u03b1 \u2208 J (X), then the\ncategory MF \u2207(p+tens) (X) is the projective limit of the categories MF \u2207(p+tens) (X\u03b1 ) (see\n2.2.4 C and D) for the definition of these categories). If all these schemes are endowed\nwith Frobenius lifts compatible with the projective system, then the similar thing can be\nsaid about the categories MF (X) and MF \u2207 (X).\n309\n\n\fb) If in a), Y is moreover a smooth W (k)-scheme, then p \u2212 F F (X \u2227 ) (resp. p \u2212\n\u2207\n\u2207\nDG(X \u2227 )) is antiequivalent (via the D functor) to MF[0,1]\n(X) (resp. to p \u2212 MF[0,1]\n(X)).\nThe proof of a) is standard (see [EGA IV, 8.5.2]), based on [Fa1, 2.1 (ii)] and on\nthe fact that any finitely generated projective module over a ring is finitely presented;\nfor the \u2207 context we need to add: as \u03a9X\u03b1 k /k is a locally free OX\u03b1 -sheaf of finite rank,\n\u2200\u03b1 \u2208 J (X), compatible with pull backs under special fibres of transition morphisms\nof the projective system, the connections involved can be viewed, locally in the Zariski\ntopology of Y , as a finite sequence of linear maps between locally free sheaves of modules\nof finite ranks.\nb) follows from a) and from 2.2.1.1 2) (for the faithfulness part of D over X \u2227 , cf.\n[BM, 4.1.1] applied over Xk ; Xk has locally in the Zariski topology a finite p-basis). This\nFact is the fourth place where we need p \u2265 3.\nThe second thing we need to add is related to the fact that di can be greater than\nthe deformation dimension d of the Shimura p-divisible groups of i). But the refinement\npart of the proof of 3.6.14.1 applies entirely in this situation (cf. EXTRA)). Using these\ntwo additions, the Theorem follows.\nE. Variants. There are many other variants of the gluing principle:\niv) we work in a context involving Shimura filtered F -crystals instead of Shimura\np-divisible groups;\nv) we weaken the part of ii) involving the versality condition;\nvi) we work in a principally quasi-polarized context;\nvii) we work modulo a power of p.\nThe variants iv) and vi) are straightforward, while in connection to vii) we refer to\n3.6.14.4. We detail now what we mean by this v). Let Qi be the completion of Ri in z i .\ni\n0\nLet D\u0303 i := DSpec(Q\nbe the regular W (k)-algebra of the universal deformation\ni ) . Let Q\nspace (see 2.2.21 and 2.2.21.1) of the Shimura p-divisible D(W (k)) showing up in i).\nCorresponding to D\u0303 i we naturally get W (k)-homomorphisms qi : Q0 \u2192 Qi , i = 1, 2.\nWhat we want to say in v): it is enough to assume that\na) ker(q1 ) = ker(q2 ), that\nb) over dominant geometric points Spec(k\u0303) \u2192 Spec(Qi /pQi ) we get naturally from\ni\nD\u0303 (see Fact 3 of 2.2.10) Shimura-ordinary \u03c3\u0303-crystals, and that\nc) the resulting W (k)-monomorphism Q0 /ker(qi ) \u0592\u2192 Qi (i \u2208 {1, 2}) is formally\nsmooth.\nWe express the combination of a) to c) by: D 1 and D 2 unfold (in z 1 and respectively z 2 ) the same quasi-versal deformation of (the Shimura filtered \u03c3-crystal underlying)\nD(W (k)), which generically (in the special fibre) is Shimura-ordinary.\nF. We do not know how to check in practice that EXTRA) holds. In a context of polarized abelian varieties, EXTRA) is in general a consequence of Serre\u2013Tate's deformation\ntheory (even in the context of v)) and of [Va2, 4.1.5] (see 3.6.14.1 E).\n310\n\n\f3.6.20. Final remarks for 3.6. 1) We might wonder why we preferred to work\nin 3.6.1-14 with open subschemes of the group G and not with open subschemes of the\n(abelian) unipotent subgroup of G acting trivially on F 0 and on M/F 1 . The reason is:\nthe full generality is useful in other situations, gives us more flexibility and, as it can be\neasily checked, the particular case (of an abelian group) can be often obtained from the\ngeneral case, by taking slices (cf. also \u00a77).\nAlso one might wonder: Why global deformations? No doubt, from many points of\nview, local deformations offer equally useful information as the global ones. However,\nfrom the deeper point of view of the classification of p-divisible groups (or objects when\nappropriate) over arbitrary Z(p) -schemes, the global deformations represent a major tool.\nAlso, from many simple points of view, they offer advantages. Just one sample: referring\nto 3.6.18.6, the Newton polygon stratification of M0 (C1 )k defined by d\u22171 (C1 ), is always\nthe pull back of a stratification of Spec(R1 /pR1 ); this last stratification can be obtained\nsignificantly easier in the case when Spec(R1 /pR1 ) is of finite type over k (often we just\nhave to use simple reductive group properties; see \u00a79-10 for details and computations).\n2) We needed (3.1.8 and 3.4.14 below are afterthoughts) the \u2207 principle for Shimura\n\u03c3-crystals for proving 3.1.0 and Milne's conjecture (see 1.15) in their full generality (and\nnot only in the context of a SHS (f, L(p) , v), where it is not needed: 2.3.16 is enough, as\nthe scheme N itself provides the needed global deformation; see the proof of 4.2 below).\nThe other principles (of 3.6.18.4-8) are just a natural extension of it. The deformation\nprinciple is a logical continuation of the \u2207-principle. Its importance stems from the fact\nthat, when applies, we often can take slices (cf. \u00a77; see also 3.6.8 8) and 3.6.8.3), and its\nversions of 3.6.14.4 are very convenient for different global and local computations, cf.\n\u00a710. It also led us to 3.6.15 B, which is the very essence of the boundedness principle of\n3.15.7 below. Also the rigidity property (see 3.6.1.4 5) and \u00a77) is a useful tool. We will\nuse it in \u00a78, in connection to 1.15.4. The gluing principle and its natural extensions (see\n[Va6]) to the generalized Shimura context and to Fontaine categories MF[\u22121,1] (\u2217), is our\nstraightforward approach to prove the existence of integral canonical models of Shimura\nvarieties of special type (cf. also [Va2, 3.2.7 8)], 3.6.1.6 and 4.14.2 below). No doubt we\nwere influenced (and inspired) by [Fa1, 7.1] and [Fa2, th. 10].\n3) In some parts of 3.6 we used [Fa2, th. 10 and the remarks after] but not in\n3.6.18.4. It is easy to see that using 2.3.17.2, 3.6.18.4.1, 3.6.18.7.0 and [Fa1, 7.1] we\nobtain another (completely different) proof of a slightly stronger form of [Fa2, th. 10 and\nthe remarks after] for p \u2265 3. To detail this, we use the notations of 3.6.18.5.1 with p \u2265 3;\nso we are dealing with a Frobenius lift of R which is essentially of additive type. Based\non the proof of the equivalence part of 3.6.18.5.1, any p-divisible object of MF[0,1](R)\n\u2207\nis a p-divisible object of MF[0,1]\n(R). So, as in the proof of 3.6.18.3.1 we can assume\np\n\u03a6R (zi ) = zi , i = 1, m.\nThe algebraization process. Let q \u2208 N. We consider the ideal IR (q) :=\n\u2207\nof R. For any p-divisible object C0 = (C0 , \u22070 ) of MF[0,1]\n(R), we can algebraize the things similarly to the proof of 3.6.18.4.1. First we consider a p-divisible\nobject C0al of MF[0,1](Ral ) which mod IR (q + 2) is C0 mod IR (q + 2); here Ral is as\nq\n(z1q , ..., zm\n)\n\n311\n\n\fin the proof of 3.6.18.4.1. Second, as in the proof of 3.6.18.4.1, we consider the moduli\nformal scheme M0 (C0al ) defined by C0al and obtained via 3.6.18.4.6; it is algebraizable\n(cf. end of 3.6.18.4.6 a)), and so not to introduce extra notations, we view it as an affine\nRal -scheme (and not as a formal scheme) which is p-adically complete.\nFrom b) of the Fact of 3.6.19 (i.e. \u2013implicitly\u2013 from [Fa1, 7.1]) and from the N-pro\u00e9tale part of 3.6.18.4.6 a), we deduce that there is a p-divisible group over M0 (C0al ) whose\n\u2207\nassociated p-divisible object of MF[0,1]\n(M0 (C0al )) is the pull back of C0al to M0 (C0al )\ntogether with the unique connection (cf. 3.6.18.8) on it.\nBut \u22070 mod IR (q) is uniquely determined by C0 mod IR (q + 2) (the argument is the\nsame as the one of the proof of 3.6.1.2; see 3.6.8 6) for things mod p). As we have a\nuniquely determined Ral -morphism Spec(R) \u2192 M0 (C0al ) (see 3.6.18.4.6 a)), we get that\nC0 modulo IR (q) is associated to a p-divisible group Dq over R/IR (q). Dq is uniquely\ndetermined (for instance, cf. [BM, 4.3.2 (i)] and [Me, ch. 4-5]; this can be also checked\nstarting from generalities on deformation theory as presented in [Fa2, \u00a77] or from [dJ1,\nth. of intro.]). So Dq+1 mod IR (q) is Dq and so (as R is complete w.r.t. the topology\ndefined by I(q)'s) we deduce the existence of a uniquely determined p-divisible group D\nover R such that D(D) is C0 .\nIt is 2.3.17.2 (strictly speaking a variant of it adapted to the context of [Fa2, rm. iii)\nafter th. 10]: see 2.4) which takes care of the mentioned context involving tensors. But\nthe proofs in [Fa2, \u00a77] (work for p = 2 as well and) are of unsurpassable beauty.\nAlso [Fa1, 7.1] can be deduced from [Fa2, th. 10], cf. 3.15.3 4) below. Moreover, the\nantiequivalence part of 3.6.18.5.1 (as well as of 3.14 B6 below) can be deduced from [dJ1,\nth. of intro.]; in fact it is easy to see (based on [Me, ch. 4-5]) that this mentioned result\nfor the smooth context (of R/pR) and [Fa2, th. 10] are equivalent to each other, even\nfor p = 2 (see the part of 2.2.21 referring to some uniqueness). Warning: despite this\nequivalence, it is worth stating explicitly that the methods of [dJ1] can not be adapted to\nthe generalized Shimura context, while the proof of [Fa2, th. 10] does (see 3.15.6 below).\nSee \u00a76 and [Va5-8] for general Dieudonn\u00e9 theories in the context of Shimura p-divisible\ngroups over very general base schemes (not necessarily regular).\nAs [Fa1, 7.1] is stated for p \u2265 3, in 3.14 below we do not come back to it.\n4) There are variants of many of the above principles. For instance, we get plenty\nof variants by working with:\n\u2013 almost p-divisible objects (see 2.2.1.7 1)), or with\n\u2013 finitely generated modules, which are not necessarily projective, or with\n\u2013 (some) W (k)-algebras which are not necessarily regular, formally smooth.\nWe do not stop to state results in this generality, as anyone can state them easily,\nwhen needed. We just point out that in the case of a W (k)-algebra R, with R = R\u2227 , we\nalways have to:\n\u2013 either work with connections which are w.r.t. an a priori specified locally free\nR-submodule of the p-adic completion of \u03a9R/W (k) , taken by a fixed Frobenius lift of R\n312\n\n\finto itself, and then we have to deal with \u03a6R -linear endomorphisms of R-modules, which\n\"keep\" us inside it, or to\n\u2013 work with \"pseudo-connections\" as in the part of the proof of 3.6.18.4.1 referring\nto its Fact 3.\n5) b) of the Fact of 3.6.19 applies if X is the henselization of the localization of a\npolynomial W (k)-algebra W (k)[x1 , ..., xm ] w.r.t. its ideal (x1 , ..., xm). If moreover k = k\u0304,\nwhen we combine this with 3.6.18.5.4 1) and 3.6.18.7, we get a very elementary way to\nconstruct Shimura p-divisible groups over X \u2227 . See [Va11] for details and applications.\n6) It seems to us (see also 3.6.18.10) that there is a great similarity between 3.6.1.3,\nthe theory of p-jets of A. Buium (see [Bu1]) and the theory of almost \u00e9tale extensions of\nG. Faltings (see [Fa1] and [Fa3]). We think it is possible to obtain significant progress in\nthe related areas by \"fitting\" these three theories together.\n7) We view the part s = 0 of 3.6.8.1 and 3.6.8.1.2 c) as the purely algebraic analogue\nof Lang's theorem.\n8) There are many other ways (besides 3.6.19 B) to express the versality (resp. uni\nplus versality) condition of 3.6.19 ii). One way is to use the proof of 3.12.1 below. Another\nway (more fashionable) is inspired from 2.3.17.2: any Shimura p-divisible group over\nW (k), whose associated Shimura \u03c3-crystal over k is (identifiable with) the one obtained\nfrom D i through the k-valued point y i of Spec(Ri\u2227 ) defined by z i , is induced from D i\nthrough a (resp. through a uniquely determined) W (k)-valued point of Spec(Ri\u2227 ) lifting\ny i . The fact that all these definitions are equivalent is proved in the same manner as for\nthe case of a SHS (see 2.3.17.2 and [Va2, 5.4-5]; see also 2.4). This is the fifth place where\nwe need p \u2265 3.\n9) In [Va6] we will use the gluing principle (see 3.6.2.2 and 3.6.19 D) to construct\n(see also \u00a76 for the first steps; see Lr,d\u2212r of 1.12 as a first sample) the theory of Shimura\nenvelopes. This theory generalizes the theory of (quotients of) integral canonical models\nof Shimura varieties.\n10) In positive characteristic, regardless of the fact that we are interested in some\nfundamental groups (see 3.6.18.4.6 C), or on some connections (see the whole of 3.6.8\nand of 3.6.18), or on some stratifications (see 3.6.8.1.4, the Claim of 3.6.18.9 and 4.5.18\nbelow), or on some deformations (see 3.6.14), or on some homomorphisms between two\np-divisible groups (see the proofs of 3.6.14.1 and of 3.6.17), the quasi Artin\u2013Schreier\nsystems of equations are at the very root of the subject.\n11) In 3.6.18 we fixed \u03a6 and \u03a6R and varied the connections, subject to the equations\n(E1 ) and (E2 ) of 3.6.1.1.1 2). It would be interesting (though not so useful) to study\nwhat happens if we fix an integrable, nilpotent mod p connection and one of the two \u03a6R\nand \u03a6, while allowing the other one to vary. The problem is: the connections involve two\nfew variables (to be compared with 3.6.18.2), to truly determine (up to \u00e9tale extensions)\nwhat has been allowed to vary.\n\n313\n\n\f3.7. The proofs of 3.2.6-7.\n3.7.1. Proof of 3.2.6. Let g2 \u2208 G(W (k)). We use the Shimura \u03c3k1 -crystal C1\nconsidered in 3.6.7.1. We recall that C1 specializes to (M \u2297W (k) W (k\u0304), g3 (\u03c60 \u22971), GW (k\u0304) ),\nwith g3 \u2208 GW (k\u0304) (W (k\u0304)) such that mod p belongs to the subset L(k\u0304) of G(k\u0304) defined as\nthe set L of 3.6.6 but for k\u0304. We deduce from 3.4.11-13 that the Shimura Lie \u03c3k1 -crystal\nLie(C1 ) attached to C1 has the same Newton polygon as (g, \u03c60 ) and so as (g, \u03c61 ) (cf. also\n3.3.1 and 3.3.4). From the fact that C1 specializes to (M, g2 \u03c60 ) (cf. 3.6.7.1), we deduce\nthat the Newton polygon of (g, g2 \u03c60 ) is above the Newton polygon of (g, \u03c60 ). Similarly,\nworking just with g0 instead of g itself, we get that the Newton polygon of (g0 , g2 \u03c60 ) is\nabove the Newton polygon of (g0 , \u03c60 ).\nAs Lie(C1 ) and (g, \u03c61 ) have the same Newton polygon, we get (cf. 3.4.11 applied\nover k1 ) that the formal isogeny type of C1 is \u03c40 . As C1 specializes to (M, g2 \u03c60 , G) and\ng2 \u2208 G(W (k)) was arbitrary, we get 3.2.6.\n3.7.2. Proof of 3.2.7 a). 3.2.7 a) results directly from 3.3.2 and 3.4.3.0. So (cf.\nalso 3.2.2), in the end of 3.5.5, the expression \"of Borel type\" can be substituted by \"of\nparabolic type\".\n3.7.3. Proof of 3.2.7 c). Let (M, F21 , \u03c62 , G) be a Shimura filtered \u03c3-crystal with\nthe property that W0 (g, \u03c62 ) is contained in F20 (g). As in 3.2.3, let 2 B be a Borel subgroup\nof G containing the image of a cocharacter \u03bc2 : Gm \u2192 G of the form g\u03bcg \u22121 (with g \u2208\nG(W (k)) such that g(F 1 ) = F21 ) and such that we have F21 (g) \u2282 Lie(2 B) \u2282 2 p \u2282 F20 (g).\nAlso, as in 3.2.3, let g3 \u2208 2 P (W (k)), with 2 P\u0001 as the parabolic subgroup of G having 2 p\nas its Lie algebra, be such that g3 \u03c62 Lie(2 B) \u2282 Lie(2 B). But now (M, F21 , g3 \u03c62 , G) has\nthe same properties as (M, F 1 , \u03c60 , G) which allowed us to prove 3.2.5-6. We get that\n(M, g3 \u03c62 ) has the formal isogeny type \u03c40 . As (g3 \u03c62 )s = g3,s \u03c6s2 , with g3,s \u2208 2 P (W (k)),\n\u2200s \u2208 N, we deduce from 3.2.1, that (M, \u03c62 ) has as well the formal isogeny type \u03c40 . This\nproves 3.2.7 c).\n3.7.4. Proof of 3.2.7 b). Let (M, F21 , \u03c62 , G) be a Shimura filtered \u03c3-crystal\u0001\nhaving \u03c40 as its formal isogeny type. 3.2.6 implies that the Lie \u03c3-crystal End(M\n\u0001 ), \u03c62\nhas the smallest Newton polygon End(P) among all Lie \u03c3-crystals End(M ), g\u03c62 , with\n\u0001\ng \u2208 G(W (k)). But for any g \u2208 G(W (k)), the Newton polygon of End(M ), g\u03c62 is\nobtained (in the logical way) from the Newton\npolygon of (g, g\u03c62 ) and from the Newton\n\u0001\npolygon of the quotient End(M )/g, g\u03c62 (this quotient can be extended to a p-divisible\nobject of MF[\u22121,1](W (k))). From this and the specialization part of the last statement\nof 3.7.1 we get that (g, \u03c62 ) has the same Newton polygon as (g, \u03c60 ). From 3.3.3 we get\nthat (up to isomorphism) we can assume \u03c62 = p0 \u03c60 , with p0 \u2208 P0 (W (k)). So, applying\n3.2.1.1 in the context of 3.3.4, 3.2.7 b) follows. This (cf. 3.7.2-3) ends the proof of 3.2.7.\n3.7.5. End of the second proof of 3.1.0. 3.2.5, 3.2.6 and 3.2.7 are proved\nrespectively in 3.4.13, 3.7.1 and 3.7.2-4. Based on 3.2.4 (and 3.2.8), 3.1.0 follows. When\nwe combine 2.3.4 with 3.2.7 b) we get:\n(ALL)\n\nAG = BG = CG = DG g0 .\n314\n\n\f3.7.6. The solution of 3.4.14. Among the above four sections 3.7.1-4, only 3.7.1\nneeds to be slightly modified. For this modification, we follow the pattern of 3.1.8.1. Let\nSpec(R) be the completion of G in its origin. We consider a Shimura filtered F -crystal\n \u0303 Let K be the algebraic closure of the field\nC over R/pR of the form (M, F 1 , g2 \u03c60 , G, f).\nof fractions of R/pR. We apply Fact 3 of 2.2.10 to the natural k-morphism Spec(K) \u2192\nSpec(R/pR): we get a Shimura \u03c3K -crystal CK = (M \u2297W (k) W (K), gK (\u03c60 \u2297 1), GW (K) )\nspecializing to (M, F 1 , g2 \u03c60 ).\nWe use a specialization argument in the following way. We can assume gK mod p\nis defined naturally by the resulting k-morphism Spec(K) \u2192 G; so gK mod p specializes\nto g0 mod p. We can assume k = k\u0304; so GR is split. Let G\u0303der\nR be the product of the\nder\nsemisimple subgroups of GR having simple adjoints. So we can define a \u03a6R -linear map\n0\nder\n\u03c8\u0304R/pR\n: Lie(G\u0303der\nR/pR ) \u2192 Lie(G\u0303R/pR )\n0\nas in 3.4.5 but in the context of C. Let \u03c8\u0304K\nbe its extension via the k-homomorphism\n0\nR \u2192 K. From the mentioned specialization, we get that \u03c8\u0304K\nspecializes to \u03c8\u030400 and so,\n\u2200s \u2208 N we have\n\n(SP EC)\n\n0 s\ndimK Im(\u03c8\u0304K\n) \u2265 dimk Im(\u03c8\u030400 )s .\n\nFor s big enough, the right hand side of this inequality is m\u03b4 . So, from 3.4.6 applied over\nK, we get that the multiplicity of the slope \u03b4 of (g0 \u2297W (k) W (K), gK (\u03c60 \u2297 1)) is m\u03b4 .\nThe same remains true if we work with another cycle of the permutation \u03b3 of 3.4.0.\nFrom 3.4.8-12 we conclude: the Newton polygons of (g \u2297W (k) W (K), gK (\u03c60 \u2297 1)) and of\n(g, \u03c60 ) are the same. So the Newton polygon of (g, g2 \u03c60 ) is above the Newton polygon\nof (g, \u03c60 ). The last paragraph of 3.7.1 does not need to be modified: we just need to\nreplace C1 by CK and k1 by K. These replacements have to be performed in connection\nto 3.7.4 as well. This ends the solution of 3.4.14.\n3.8. The non quasi-split context. The basic results of 3.1 remain true, if we\ndo not assume G is quasi-split (assumption made in the def. 2.2.8). To see this, we\nfirst remark that if G is not quasi-split, then the field k must be infinite (any reductive\ngroup over a finite field is quasi-split, cf. [Bo2, 16.6]). Let k1 be a finite Galois extension\nof k such that Gk1 is quasi-split. Let \u03c31 be the Frobenius automorphism of W (k1 ).\nWe know 3.1.0 is true for GW (k1 ) (i.e. for when we work with Shimura \u03c31 -crystals\n(M \u2297W (k) W (k1 ), g(\u03c6 \u2297 1), GW (k1 ) ), with g \u2208 G(W (k1 ))). So to get 3.1.0 for G (i.e. for\nwhen we work with Shimura \u03c3-crystals (M, g\u03c6, G), with g \u2208 G(W (k))) we just have to\nremark two simple Facts:\n3.8.1. Fact. There is g \u2208 G(W (k)) such that (M \u2297W (k) W (k1 ), g\u03c6 \u2297 1, GW (k1 ) ) is\na GW (k1 ) -ordinary \u03c31 -crystal.\n3.8.2. Fact. If (M, g0 \u03c6), with g0 \u2208 G(W (k)), is such that its extension to k1 is a\nGW (k1 ) -ordinary \u03c31 -crystal, due to the uniqueness assertion of 3.1.0 b), the filtration F01\nof M \u2297W (k) W (k1 ) describing the GW (k1 ) -canonical lift of the GW (k1 ) -ordinary \u03c31 -crystal\n315\n\n\f\u0001\nM \u2297W (k) W (k1 ), g0 \u03c6 \u2297 1, GW (k1 ) , is definable over W (k) (i.e. F01 = F\u030301 \u2297W (k) W (k1 ),\nwith F\u030301 \u2282 M ).\n3.8.2 is trivial. 3.8.1 results from:\n\u2013 the fact that G(k) is dense in Gk (cf. [Bo2, 18.3]) and so its image in G(k1 ) is\ndense in Gk1 , and from\n\u2013 the fact that there is an open subscheme U of Gk1\u0001 such that for any g \u2208 G(W (k1 ))\nlifting a k1 -valued point of U , M \u2297W (k) W (k1 ), g(\u03c60 \u22971) is a GW (k1 ) -ordinary \u03c31 -crystal.\nThis last fact is a consequence of the stronger form of 3.6.6 mentioned in 3.6.6.1 1),\nof 3.3.4 and of the part of 3.4.11 referring to things mod p; as pointed out in 3.6.6.1 1),\nit is also a consequence of 3.6.10, 3.4.8 and 3.4.11 (via the specialization theorem).\n3.9. Supplements to 3.1 and applications.\n3.9.1. The Lie stable p-rank. Let (M, \u03c62 , G) be a Shimura \u03c3-crystal. For not\noverloading the notation, we first assume G is split. We use the previous notations of\n3.1-3, 3.4.0 and 3.4.5. One difference: we take \u03c62 := g2 \u03c60 , with g2 \u2208 G(W (k)).\nL\nL\nLet \u03a8 : i\u2208I gi \u2192 i\u2208I gi be the \u03c3-linear map defined by the rule:\n\u001a\np\u03c62 (x) if x \u2208 gi and F 1 (gi ) 6= {0}\n\u03a8(x) :=\n\u03c62 (x) if x \u2208 gi and F 1 (gi ) = {0} .\nL\nL\nLet \u03a8\u0304 : i\u2208I gi \u2297W (k) k \u2192 i\u2208I gi \u2297W (k) k be obtained by taking \u03a8\u0304 mod p. Let\nN\u03c62 :=\n\n\\\n\nIm(\u03a8\u0304m ).\n\nm\u2208N\n\nBased on 3.4.5, we refer to \u03a8 (resp. \u03a8\u0304) as the Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Hasse\u2013Witt shift (resp.\nmap) of (M, \u03c62 , G) or of (g, \u03c62 ).\nWe define\nR\u03c62 := dimk (N\u03c62 ).\nWe call N\u03c62 (resp. R\u03c62 ) the Lie stable k-vector space (resp. the Lie stable p-rank or the\nFaltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Hasse\u2013Witt invariant) of (M, \u03c62 , G).\nSimilarly we define the Lie stable k-vector space and the Lie stable p-rank of any\nsplit Shimura Lie \u03c3-crystal over k.\n3.9.1.0. Cyclic ranks. As \u03a8\u0304 is a \u03c3-linear endomorphism of a finite dimensional\nk-vector space, we deduce the existence of m \u2208 N such that\nN\u03c62 = Im(\u03a8\u0304m );\nfor instance we can take m to be the following value which does not depend on g2\nl.c.m.{o(\u03b3s )rs |s \u2208 J0 },\n316\n\n\fwhere o(\u03b3s ) is the order of the permutation \u03b3s of I and where rs is the relative dimension\nof Gis , with is \u2208 I such that \u03b3s permutes cyclically a subset of I containing is . The\nsmallest such value of m is called the cyclic rank of (M, \u03c62 , G) or of (g, \u03c62 ). Similarly,\nwe define the cyclic rank of any split Shimura Lie \u03c3-crystal over k.\n3.9.1.1. Remark. The Lie stable p-ranks, the Lie stable k1 -vector spaces and the\ncyclic ranks are well defined for any Shimura \u03c3k1 -crystal (M1 , \u03c61 , G1 ) over a perfect field\nk1 . This is so due to the fact that the map \u03a81 defined as in 3.9.1 but starting from\nthe extension of (M1 , \u03c61 , G1 ) to k1 is in fact definable over W (k1 ), cf. the existence of\na cocharacter \u03bc1 : Gm \u2192 G1 defining the filtration class of (M1 , \u03c61 , G1 ) and cf. the\nclassification (see [Ti1]) of k1 -simple (and so implicitly of W (k1 )-simple) adjoint groups.\nIn other words we have:\n\u2013 Lie(Gad\n1 ) is a direct sum of W (k1 )-simple Lie factors, each one F of them having\nthe property that all simple Lie factors of F \u2297W (k1 ) W (k1 ) are producing (as in 3.4.3.4)\n\u03b5i 's numbers which are either all positive or are all 0;\n\u2013 the group cover of Gder\n1W (k\n\n1)\n\ndefined naturally using the product of all semisimple\n\nGder\n1W (k1 )\n\nsubgroups of\nhaving simple adjoints, is obtained from a group cover of Gder\nby\n1\nextensions of scalars.\nThe same applies to the Shimura Lie context. So from now on we do not assume G\nis split.\n3.9.2. Theorem. A Shimura \u03c3-crystal (M, \u03c62 , G) is a G-ordinary \u03c3-crystal iff its\nLie stable p-rank is maximal (i.e. R\u03c62 \u2265 R\u03c63 , for any \u03c63 = g3 \u03c62 , with g3 \u2208 G(W (k)))\nand so equal to R\u03c60 .\nProof: We first remark that (g, \u03c62 ) has the smallest Newton polygon among all\nShimura Lie \u03c3-crystals (g, g\u03c62 ) iff for any cycle \u03b30 of the permutation \u03b3 of I, (g0 , \u03c62 )\nhas the smallest Newton polygon among all Shimura Lie \u03c3-crystals (g0 , g\u03c62 ) (here g \u2208\nG(W (k)), \u03b30 is a cyclic, transitive permutation of a subset I0 of I, and g0 = \u2295i\u2208I0 gi ).\nOne implication is trivial, while the other one results from 3.4.8 and 3.1.0 c) applied to\nall classes of the form Cl(M, \u03c60 , G\u03030 ) (so defined by elements s \u2208 J0 ). We have:\nR\u03c62 :=\n\nX\n\nm\u03b4s ,\n\ns\u2208J0\n\nwith each m\u03b4s as a suitable multiplicity of some slope\n\u03b4s \u2208 [\u22121, 0].\nFor s \u2208 J0 , \u03b4s and m\u03b4s are defined in the same manner as the slope \u03b4 and its multiplicity\nm\u03b4 of 3.4.4-5; for instance, \u03b40 = \u03b4 and m\u03b40 is (cf. 3.4.5.1 B) the multiplicity of the slope\n\u03b4 for (g0 , \u03c62 ). Warning: the formula of 3.4.4 remains true even if I1 is the empty set. So\nthe Theorem follows from 3.4.10.\n317\n\n\f3.9.3. Corollary. The fact that a Shimura \u03c3-crystal (M, g\u03c6, G), with g \u2208 G(W (k)),\nis G-ordinary depends only on the value of g mod p.\n3.9.3.1. An application. We refer to 3.6.1.3. We consider a point y \u2208 Spec(Rj )(k\u0304);\nlet z \u2208 Spec(Rj )(W (k\u0304)) be its Teichm\u00fcller lift. We consider the Shimura filtered \u03c3\u0304-crystal\nobtained from MRj by pull back via z (cf. 3.6.3); if by forgetting its filtration, we get\na G-ordinary \u03c3\u0304-crystal, then we refer to y as a G-ordinary (or Shimura-ordinary) point.\n3.9.3 guarantees that in fact we can decide if y is or is not a G-ordinary point, without\nconsidering z.\nFrom 3.1.0 c) we get that the multiplicity of the slope \u22121 of the Shimura Lie \u03c3-crystal\nof (M, \u03c60 , G) is greater or equal to the multiplicity of the slope \u22121 of any Shimura Lie\n\u03c3\u0304-crystal of the form (M \u2297W (k) W (k\u0304), g(\u03c60 \u2297 1), GW (k\u0304) ), with g \u2208 G(W (k\u0304)). So from\n3.6.18.7.0, from 3.6.18.4.3 and from the construction of the special fibre of Spec(Qj ) (see\n3.6.8 1) to 14); see also 3.6.8.1.3 and 3.6.8.2) we get:\nCorollary. If y is a G-ordinary point and if ry = dimW (k) (G) (see 3.6.18.9 for the\ndefinition of ry ), then y lifts to a point y\u221e \u2208 Spec(Qj )(k\u0304).\n3.9.4. The refined Lie stable p-rank. We use the notations of the beginning of\n3.4, with G split. We choose a bijection fJ0 between J0 and the set S(1, |J0 |). Then\n\u2200s \u2208 J0 , we can define the Lie stable p-rank R\u03c62 (s) of (M, \u03c62 , G) w.r.t. s or w.r.t. the\nsubset of I of which \u03b3s is a cyclic permutation. For instance, if we work with the cycle\nr\n\u03b30 , R\u03c62 (0) is nothing else but the Lie stable p-rank of (g0 , \u03c62 ). We denote by R\u03c6\nthe\n2\n|J0 |-tuple (a1 , . . . , a|J0 | ) of non-negative integers defined by the formula:\nal :=\n\nR\u03c62 fJ\u22121\n(l)\n0\n\n\u0001\n\nlength \u03b3f \u22121 (l)\nJ0\n\n\u0001,\n\n\u2200l \u2208 S(1, |J0 |). 3.4.2 guarantees that al 's are non-negative integers; for instance, if\nl = fJ0 (0), then R\u03c62 (0) is the multiplicity of the slope \u03b4 of (g0 , \u03c62 ) (cf. 3.4.5.1 B) and so\nis a multiple of |I0 | = length(\u03b30 ). If G is not split, then we define the refined Lie stable\np-rank of (M, \u03c6, G) to be the refined Lie stable p-rank of its extension to k\u0304.\nOn the set of |J0 |-tuples of non-negative integers we introduce a partial order by the\nrule\n(b1 , b2 , . . . , b|J0 | ) \u2264 (c1 , c2 , . . . , c|J0 | )\niff\nbi \u2264 ci , , \u2200i \u2208 S(1, |J0 |).\nFrom the proof of 3.9.2 we get:\n3.9.5. Corollary. A Shimura \u03c3-crystal (M, \u03c62 , G) is a G-ordinary \u03c3-crystal iff its\nr\nrefined Lie stable p-rank is maximal, i.e. is equal to R\u03c6\n.\n0\n3.9.6. The adjoint context. Similarly to 3.9.4, we define the refined Lie stable prank of any split Shimura Lie \u03c3-crystal. The refined Lie stable p-rank of a split Shimura\n318\n\n\f(Lie) \u03c3-crystal over k is the same, if instead of working with Shimura Lie \u03c3-crystals\nof the above form (g0 , \u03c62 ), we work with their adjoint Lie \u03c3-crystals (gad\n0 , \u03c62 ), where\n1\nad\n]\n(see\n2.2.13;\nsee\n3.4.1.3\nfor\nnotations).\ngad\n:=\nLie(\nG\u0303\n)\n\u2282\nLie(\nG\u0303\n)[\n0 p\n0\n0\nTo see this, we use the notations of 3.4. If we are dealing with a non-empty subset\nof I whose elements are permuted transitively by \u03b3 and is such that the Lie algebras\nof the semisimple subgroups of G indexed by it, are contained in F 0 (g), the statement\nis obvious. So we can assume we are dealing with the subset I0 of I of 3.4.0 (cf. the\nassumption of 3.4.1.2). The kernel of the natural map g0 \u2297W (k) k \u2192 gad\n0 \u2297W (k) k, has\ntrivial intersection with the Lie algebra of any connected, smooth, unipotent subgroup\nof Gk . So, \u2200m \u2208 N, \u03a8\u0304m (g1 ) can be naturally identified with the k-vector subspace of gad\n0\ndefined similarly, using Lie(Gad\n)\n\u2297\nk\nand\nthe\nadjoint\nvariant\nof\n\u03a8\u0304.\nW\n(k)\n1\nIn what follows, we refer to this adjoint variant of \u03a8 (resp. of \u03a8\u0304) as the Faltings\u2013\nShimura\u2013Hasse\u2013Witt adjoint shift (resp. adjoint map) of (M, \u03c62 , G) or of (g, \u03c62 ). Similarly, we speak about the Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Hasse\u2013Witt adjoint shift (resp. adjoint map)\nof (M, \u03c62 , G) w.r.t. I0 (or to an element s \u2208 J0 or to the permutation \u03b3s ), or more generally w.r.t. a non-empty subset of J0 (i.e. w.r.t. a non-empty subset of I left invariant\nby \u03b3).\n3.9.7. The zero, the positive, and the non-negative rank and type. By\nthe non-negative rank (resp. type) of a Shimura \u03c3-crystal (M, \u03c6, G) over k (or of its\nattached Shimura Lie \u03c3-crystal) we mean the rank as a W (k)-module (resp. we mean\nthe G(W (k))-conjugacy class) of p\u22650 := W0 (Lie(G), \u03c6). Similarly we define the positive\nand the zero ranks and types, by using positive slopes and respectively the slope 0 (the\nwording \"parabolic\" has to be removed or replaced accordingly).\nWarning: to know the non-negative rank is the same as to know the zero or the\npositive rank; but this is not so if we replace rank by type. These definitions extend to\nall Shimura (adjoint) Lie \u03c3-crystals or isocrystals or to a filtered context.\n3.9.7.1. The refined non-negative type. We consider a lift F 1 of (M, \u03c6, G). Let\nP be the parabolic subgroup of G normalizing F 1 . As in 3.2.3, we fix a maximal torus T\nof P such that the canonical split cocharacter of (M, F 1 , \u03c6) factors through T . For\n\u03b1 \u2208 SS := [0, 1] \u2229\n\n1\ndimW (k) (M )!\n\nZ,\n\nlet P\u2265\u03b1 (resp. P=\u03b1 ) be the integral, closed subgroup of G such that the Lie algebra of\nits generic fibre is W\u03b1 (Lie(G)[ p1 ], \u03c6) (resp. is W (\u03b1)(Lie(G)[ p1 ], \u03c6)) (see 2.2.3 3)). P\u22650 is\na parabolic subgroup of G and P=\u03b1 and P\u2265\u03b1 are subgroups of P\u2265\u03b2 if \u03b1 \u2208 [\u03b2, 1], with \u03b1,\n\u03b2 \u2208 SS. Let CON G be the subgroup of G(W (k)) normalizing F 1 /pF 1 .\nDefinition. By the refined non-negative type of (M, \u03c6, G) we mean the CON Gconjugacy class of the (indexed) family of subgroups of G formed by (P\u2265\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208SS and by\n(P=\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208SS . It depends only on the inner isomorphism class of (M, \u03c6, G).\nThe intersection Pk \u2229 P\u22650 k contains a maximal torus of Pk . As in the proof of Fact 1\nof 2.2.9 3), we deduce that, up to inner isomorphism of (M, \u03c6, G) defined by an element\n319\n\n\fel of G(W (k)) which mod p is the identity, we can assume that the intersection P \u2229 P\u22650\ncontains a maximal torus T0 of G. Till end of 3.9.7.2 we assume k = k\u0304. We can assume\nthat, up to inner isomorphisms defined by elements of P (W (k)), T0 = T (to be compared\nwith 3.2.3). As T was fixed, we have a finite number of possibilities for P\u22650 : the number\nof parabolic subgroups of G containing T is finite.\nQuestions. Which parabolic subgroups of G containing T can be the non-negative\ntype of (M, g\u03c6, G), for some g \u2208 G(W (k))? What general principles are governing the\nrefined non-negative types of (M, g\u03c6, G), for g \u2208 G(W (k)) allowed to vary? When\n(M, \u03c6, G) is uniquely determined (up to inner isomorphism) by its (refined) non-negative\ntype?\n3.9.7.2. The inductive property. Let R0 be the quotient of P\u22650 by its unipotent\nradical P>0 . We view it as well as a subgroup of G via: it is naturally isomorphic to the\nonly Levi subgroup of P\u22650 containing T . Let\ng \u2208 P\u22650 (W (k))\nbe such that g\u03c6(Lie(T )) = Lie(T )) (this is the same as 3.2.3). Let h be the image in\nR0 (W (k)) of g \u22121 . The quadruple (M, g\u03c6, T ) is a Shimura \u03c3-crystal (cf. Fact 1 of 2.2.9\n1)). So (M, hg\u03c6, R0) is as well a Shimura \u03c3-crystal. Moreover,\n\u03c6 = n+ (1)(hg\u03c6)\nwith n+ (1) \u2208 P>0 (W (k)). By induction on m \u2208 N we get that\n\u03c6m = n+ (m)(hg\u03c6)m ,\nwith n+ (m) := \u03c6m (hg\u03c6)\u2212m \u2208 P>0 (B(k)). So the semisimple elements b1 and b2\nof G(B(k)) defined by \u03c6m and respectively by (hg\u03c6)m (see 2.2.24 and 2.2.24.1) are\nP>0 (B(k))-conjugate. Argument: b1 and b2 have the same image in R0 (B(k)) and so\ncan be viewed as B(k)-valued points of maximal tori T1 and respectively T2 of P\u22650B(k)\nhaving the same image in R0B(k) ; based on the conjugation part of [Bo2, 20.5] we can\nassume T1 = T2 and so b1 = b2 . We conclude:\nCorollary. The Newton polygons of (M, \u03c6) and of (M, hg\u03c6) are the same.\n3.9.7.2.1. Remarks. 1) 3.9.7.1-2 extend automatically to the generalized Shimura\ncontext of 2.2.8 3) and 4) but (warning) not to the context of 2.2.8 3a) and 4a) (the\nreason is: in the context of 2.2.8 3a) and 4a), not any element el as in 3.9.7.1 can be used\nas an inner isomorphism).\n2) The duality of language mentioned at the end of 2.2.3 3) allows us to redo all\nof 3.9.7.1-2 in the context of non-positive slopes. From the point of view of 3.9.7.2, we\npresently can not see any advantage of using the (refined) non-positive types instead of\n(refined) non-negative types.\n320\n\n\f3.9.7.3. An example. Let \u03b1 \u2208 W (k). We take dimW (k) (M ) = 6 and G = GL(M ).\nLet \u03c6\u03b1 take the elements of a 6-tuple (e1 , ..., e6) formed by elements of a W (k)-basis of M\ninto (e2 , pe3 , pe1 , e5 , e6 + \u03b1e1 , pe4 ). The slopes of (M, \u03c6\u03b1 ) are 31 and 32 . The non-negative\ntype of (M, \u03c6\u03b1 , G) is defined by the parabolic subgroup P\u22650 of G normalizing the W (k)span < e1 , e2 , e3 >. Let T be the maximal torus of G normalizing ei , i = 1, 6. Let P>0 ,\nP\u22650 and R0 be as abve. Let N16 be the unipotent subgroup of G that fixes ei , i = 1, 5,\nand takes e6 into the W (k)-span < e1 , e6 >. Its dimension is 1. We have:\nClaim. If \u03b11 , \u03b12 \u2208 W (k) are such that \u03b11 \u2212 \u03b12 6\u2208 pW (k), then (M, \u03c6\u03b11 ) and\n(M, \u03c6\u03b12 ) are not isomorphic (even if we consider pull backs to other algebraically closed\nfields containing k).\nProof: This can be \u0001easily checked. First, any isomorphism between 2 members\nof the family (M, \u03c6\u03b1 , G) \u03b1\u2208W (k) is defined by an element h0 \u2208 P\u22650 (W (k)). Second,\nwe can write h0 = n+ r0 , with n+ \u2208 P\u22650 (W (k)) and r0 \u2208 R0 (W (k)). Third, r0 is an\nautomorphism of (M, \u03c60 ). Fourth, a simple computation shows that r0 mod p (under\ninner conjugation) centralizes N16 k . Fifth, P>0 is abelian and so all its W (k)-valued\npoints (under inner conjugation) act trivially on N16 . So, h0 \u03c6\u03b11 h\u22121\n= n12 \u03c6\u03b12 , with\n0\nn12 \u2208 P>0 (W (k)) such that its component in N16 is non-zero mod p; here the components\nof n12 are with respect to Ga subgroups of P>0 normalized by T . This ends the proof.\nConclusion: the number of isomorphism classes of p-divisible groups of rank 6 and\ndimension 3 over k is not finite. Based on 3.6.15 B we also get: there is n \u2208 N such that\nthe number of isomorphism classes of tuncations mod pn of p-divisible groups of rank 6\nand dimension 3 over k is not finite (it seems to us that we can take n = 2 but we will\nnot stop to check this).\nThe above example can be put in a family: we just need to apply 3.6.11 in the\ncontext of N16 and of (M, \u03c60 , G).\n3.9.8. Truncations in the adjoint Lie \u03c3-crystal context. Not to be too\nlong, we refer just to the adjoint context; the notations are independent of the previous ones. Let (g, \u03c6, F 0 (g), F 1 (g)) be an arbitrary Shimura adjoint Lie \u03c3-crystal. Let\n(g, F\u0303 1 (g), F\u0303 2 (g), \u03a8) be its Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Hasse\u2013Witt shift (cf. 3.9.1.1 and 3.4.5). In\n2.2.14 we defined the truncation mod pn , where n \u2208 N, of (g, \u03c6, F 0 (g), F 1 (g)) as well as\nof (g, F\u0303 1 (g), F\u0303 2 (g), \u03a8). The pair\n(g/pn g, \u03a8)\nis referred as the truncation mod pn of (g, \u03c6) (see 3.13.7.4 2) below for a justification;\nhere we still denote by \u03a8 its reduction mod pn ). As in 2.2.14.2, as the adjoint group over\nW (k) having g as its Lie algebra is uniquely determined (see 2.2.13), we speak about\ninner automorphisms of such truncations.\n3.9.9. Deformations in the non-smooth context. We consider the following\nsituation. Let (M, \u03c60 , G, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ) be a Shimura-ordinary \u03c3-crystal with an emphasized\nfamily of tensors. Let g \u2208 G(W (k)). We consider a set Jg containing J and an extra\nfamily of tensors (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208Jg \\J of T (M [ p1 ]) fixed by g\u03c60 . Let G1 be the Zariski closure in\n321\n\n\fGL(M ) of the subgroup of GL(M [ p1 ]) fixing t\u03b1 , \u2200 \u2208 Jg . We assume it is integral. The\nquestion is:\nQ. Under what conditions, the quadruple (M, g\u03c60 , G, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208Jg ) is the specialization\nof a similar quadruple over k[[x]], with x an independent variable, such that by forgetting\nthe extra tensors (indexed by Jg \\ J ) and by pull back under a geometric, dominant point\nof Spec(k[[x]]), we get a Shimura-ordinary F -crystal (isomorphic to the corresponding\npull back of (M, \u03c60 , G, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ))?\nFor instance, if we have a quasi-polarization pM : (M, g\u03c60 ) \u2297W (k) (M, g\u03c60 ) \u2192\nW (k)(1) and if G is the maximal integral subgroup of GL(M ) normalizing pM , then\nthe first main result of [NO] (in its abstract formulation pertaining to p-divisible groups)\ncan be interpreted as: no extra conditions are required. We have a similar question,\nwhere k[[x]] is replaced by the henselization of the localization of k[x] w.r.t. (x).\nTo handle such questions, we propose an approach in two steps. First step would\nbe: use B6 of 3.14 below to deform (M, \u03c60 , G, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208Jg ) to a similar quadruple (M \u2297W (k)\nW (k1 ), g1 (\u03c60 \u2297 1), GW (k1 ) , (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208Jg )) over the algebraic closure k1 of k((x)) which lifts\nto W (k1 ), in the sense that there is a lift F11 of (M \u2297W (k) W (k1 ), g1 (\u03c60 \u2297 1), GW (k1 ) ) such\nthat t\u03b1 is in the F10 -filtration of T (M [ p1 ]) defined by F11 , \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 Jg \\ J . Second step would\nbe: show that the quintuple (M \u2297W (k) W (k1 ), g1 (\u03c60 \u2297 1), GW (k1 ) ) can be deformed over\nthe p-adic completion of an N-pro-\u00e9tale scheme over a smooth W (k1 )-scheme, which has\na connected special fibre and has k1 -valued points with the property that the pull back\nthrough them of the corresponding deformation are, when the extra tensors are ignored,\nShimura-ordinary \u03c3k1 -crystals.\nIn what follows we deal only with the second step; it gives a lot of extra information\n(warning: the below proof is part of the third place where we need p > 2). So we assume\nthere is a lift F 1 of (M, g\u03c60 , G) such that t\u03b1 \u2208 F 0 (T (M [ p1 ])), \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 Jg \\ J . We also\nassume there is a smooth, affine W (k)-scheme G2 and a W (k)-morphism m1 : G2 \u2192 G1\nsuch that the following condition holds:\nCOND. g \u2208 G1 (W (k)) and there are W (k)-valued points z1 and z2 of G2 lifting\nrespectively 1M and g \u22121 and whose special fibres factor through the same connected\ncomponent of G2k .\nA. Theorem. There is an N-pro-\u00e9tale scheme G3\nspecial fibre is a connected, AG k-scheme, and there\n\u2207\nobject of p \u2212 MF[0,1]\n(G3 )) of (M, F 1 , g\u03c60 , G, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208Jg )\nspecial fibre is (in the sense of forgetting all tensors\nShimura-ordinary.\n\nof G2 to which z1 lifts and whose\nis a deformation (defined by an\nover G\u2227\n3 which generically in this\nindexed by elements of Jg \\ J )\n\nProof: We write G2 = Spec(R2 ). Localizing, we can assume we have a potentialdeformation sheet (G2 , b2 , z1 ) and that G2k is connected; warning: it does not matter if\nz2 does not factor any more through G2 under this localization. Let \u03a6R2 be the Frobenius\nof R2\u2227 we get as in 3.6.9.1 from b2 . We apply 3.6.18.6 to the following p-divisible object\nof MF[0,1] (R2 )\nC2 := (M \u2297W (k) R2\u2227 , F 1 \u2297W (k) R2\u2227 , g2univ (g\u03c60 \u2297 1)),\n322\n\n\fwith g2univ \u2208 G(R2\u2227 ) \u2282 GL(M )(R2 ) the universal element logically defined by m1 . Let\nl2 : G3 \u2192 G2\nbe as l1 in the end of 3.6.18.6 a); so G\u2227\n3 := M0 (C2 ) as a G2 -scheme. 3.9.2 implies that the\ncondition of Shimura-ordinariness is an open condition. So from COND we deduce that\nthere is an open subscheme U2 of G2k such that for any W (k\u0304)-valued Teichm\u00fcller lift z of\n\u2217\nG\u2227\n2 whose special fibre factors through U2 , (z (C2 ), GW (k\u0304) ) is a lift of a Shimura-ordinary\n\u03c3\u0304-crystal. From this and 3.1.8.1.2 b), the Theorem follows (to be compared with 3.9.3.1).\nB. Example. We assume that we are in the context of a quasi-polarized filtered\n\u03c3-crystal (M, F 1 , g\u03c60 , pM ). So G = GL(M ) and G is the maximal integral subgroup of G\nnormalizing pM . We assume g \u2208 G1 (W (k)) (if k = k\u0304, due to the assumption on F 1 this\nrepresents no restriction as we can see through simple arguments involving Zp -structures\nas in 2.2.9 8)). Let e \u2208 N be such that dimW (k) (M ) = 2e. It is an elementary fact that\nthere is a W (k)-basis {e1 , e2 , ..., e2e} of M such that pM (ei , ej ) = 0 unless |j \u2212 i| = e.\nWe can assume pM (ei , ei+e ) = pni , where\n1 = n1 = n2 = ... = ni1 < ni1 +1 = ... = ni2 < ... < nim\u22121 +1 = ... = nim ,\nwith m \u2208 N and im = e. Let i0 := 0. There is a connected subgroup S1 of GL(M/pM )\nsuch that the special fibres of all W (k\u0304)-valued points of G1 , do factor through S1 and the\nresulting set of k\u0304-valued points of S1 is dense in S1 . This is an immediate consequence of\nthe below two properties (P1) and (P2) and of the fact that the standard representation\nof any symplectic group over a field is absolutely irreducible (this last thinks takes care\nof the connectedness part). We have:\n(P 1)\n\nS1der\n\n=\n\nm\nY\n\nSp(Vj , p\u2212nj pM )k ,\n\nj=1\n\nwhere\nVj :=< eij\u22121 +1 , ..., eij , eij\u22121 +1+e , ..., eij +e > .\nMoreover,\n(P 2)\n\ns(Vj /pVj ) \u2282 \u2295m\nl=j Vj /pVj \u2297k k\u0304,\n\n\u2200s \u2208 S1 (k\u0304). So using a sequence of dilatation (see [BLR, 3.2-4]; the first one is the\ndilatation of S1 in G1 ), we deduce the existence of a morphism l2 as above for which\nCOND holds; l2 is in fact a homomorphism (cf. [BLR, (d) of p. 64]). We conclude:\nCorollary. Any quasi-polarized p-divisible group over k which lifts to a quasipolarized p-divisible group over W (k), can be deformed over the p-adic completion of\nan N-pro-\u00e9tale scheme X over a smooth W (k)-scheme, with Xk as a geometrically connected, AG k-scheme, to a quasi-polarized, ordinary p-divisible group over k\u0304.\n323\n\n\fThere are plenty of examples (for instance, see [Nor, ch. 4]) of quasi-polarized \u03c3\u0304crystals which are not obtained from quasi-polarized filtered \u03c3\u0304-crystals by forgetting the\nfiltration. Here is a very simple numerical version of loc. cit. We take e = 2 and k = Fp .\nWe assume pM (e1 , e3 ) = 1 and pM (e2 , e4 ) = p. We denote g\u03c60 by \u03c6 and we assume \u03c6\ntakes (e1 , e2 , e3 , e4 ) into (e3 , e4 , pe1 , pe2 ). So all slopes of (M, \u03c6) are 12 . It is trivial to see\nthat there is no direct summand F 1 of M \u2297Zp W (F) lifting the F-submodule of M \u2297W (k) F\ngenerated by e3 and e4 mod p and such that pM (a, b) = 0, \u2200a, b \u2208 F 1 .\nC. Remarks. 1) We come back to the general context of a lift F 1 of (M, g\u03c60 , G)\nsuch that t\u03b1 \u2208 F 0 (T (M [ p1 ])), \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 Jg \\ J . As in C we define S1 . Warning: in general\nS1 is not connected. However, S1 is a smooth k-group. We consider a homomorphism\nm\u20321 : G\u20322 \u2192 G1 , with G\u20322 smooth over W (k), which is obtained as in C, using dilatations.\nUsing the universal property of dilatations (see [BLR, p. 63]), we deduce that we can\nassume m1 factors through m\u20321 . If COND holds for m1 then it holds for m\u2032 and so we\ncan assume m1 = m\u20321 ; however, for different computational problems it is still useful not\nto assume m1 = m\u20321 . The Kodaira\u2013Spencer map of the deformation we get over a G\u2032\u2227\n3 as\nin the above proof (but working with m\u20321 ), in each k\u0304-valued point y of G\u20323 has an image\nwhose dimension is exactly the dimension d of the image of Im(Lie(G\u20322k ) \u2192 Lie(S1k )) in\nEnd(M )/F 0 (End(M ))\u2297W (k) k. So forgetting the tensors t\u03b1 , \u03b1 \u2208 Jg \\J , by taking suitable\nslices we get (over resulting formally smooth subschemes of G\u2032\u2227\n3 of relative dimension d)\nShimura p-divisible groups which are uni plus quasi-versal.\n2) We do not assume anymore the existence of F 1 as in 1). Still S1 can be defined\nas in C. Let S2 be the reduced group subscheme of S1 which normalizes the kernel F\u03041\nof \u03c60 mod p. If S2 has no characters producing as usual a direct sum decomposition\nM/pM = F\u0304 1 \u2295 F\u0304 0 , then an F 1 as in 1) does not exist.\n3.10. Terminology and formulas.\nAll terminologies and formulas to be introduced below in the context of Shimura Lie\n\u03c3-crystals, will be used as well in the rational context of Shimura (adjoint) (filtered) Lie\nisocrystals attached to Shimura (adjoint) (filtered) Lie \u03c3-crystals.\n3.10.0. Cyclic Shimura Lie \u03c3-crystals. The notations that follows are similar\nto the previous ones but, without special reference, they are independent. We start\nconsidering an arbitrary perfect field k. A Shimura adjoint Lie \u03c3-crystal (g, \u03c6) over k\nis said to be cyclic, if g is the Lie algebra of an adjoint\ngroup G over W (k) such that\nQ\n\u2032\nconsidering the product decomposition GW (k\u0304) = i\u2208I \u0303 Gi in simple groups over W (k\u0304),\n\u03c6 \u2297 1 permuting cyclically the direct summands Lie(G\u2032i )[ p1 ]'s of g \u2297W (k) W (k\u0304)[ p1 ].\n(g, \u03c6) is said to be trivial if \u03c6(g) = g; otherwise it is said to be non-trivial. (g, \u03c6) is\nsaid to be of Al , Bl , Cl , Dl , E6 or E7 Lie type if the factors G\u2032i are of this Lie type; in\nwhat follows, we ignore the other Lie types, as they force (g, \u03c6) to be trivial, cf. 2.2.7.\nAs in 3.2.3, let g \u2208 G(W (k\u0304)) be such that g(\u03c6 \u2297 1) takes the Lie algebras b and t of a\nBorel subgroup BW (k\u0304) of GW (k\u0304) and respectively of a maximal torus TW (k\u0304) of BW (k\u0304) into\nthemselves. The permutation of the basis of roots of Lie(G\u2032i ) w.r.t. the maximal torus\n324\n\n\fTi\u2032 := TW (k\u0304) \u2229 G\u2032i of G\u2032i and corresponding to the Borel subgroup Bi\u2032 := BW (k\u0304) \u2229 G\u2032i of G\u2032i ,\n \u0303\ninduced (as in 3.4.3.1) by the restriction of (g(\u03c6 \u2297 1))|I | to Lie(B \u2032 ), can be non-trivial.\ni\n\nThis permutation can be (cf. 3.4.3.1):\n\u2013 an involution (this can happen only when g is of Al , Dl or E6 Lie type);\n\u2013 a cycle of order 3 (this can happen only when g is of D4 Lie type);\n\u2013 trivial.\nWe say respectively that (g \u2297W (k) W (k\u0304), g(\u03c6 \u2297 1)) (or (g, \u03c6) itself) is with involution,\nor with a 3-cycle, or without a cycle.\nAll above definitions are used as well in a filtered context or in a non-necessarily\nadjoint context (i.e. when we work with the Lie algebra of a semisimple group over W (k)\nwhich is not necessarily adjoint). In particular we also speak about cyclic Shimura Lie\n\u03c3-crystals which are not necessarily adjoint.\n3.10.0.1. Remark. If we just require the simple factors of Lie(G) to be permuted\ncyclically by \u03c6, then we say (g, \u03c6) is weakly cyclic. These notions of weakly cyclic and\ncyclic coincide over finite fields but not in general. To exemplify this, we restrict to the\ntrivial context, as the adjustments for the non-trivial context are easily made. Let k be\nsuch that there is a Galois extension of it k1 of whose Galois group is not cyclic. Let \u03b3\nbe an automorphism of W (k1 ) whose restriction to W (k) is \u03c3. Let H1 be a split, simple\nadjoint group over Zp . Let H := ResW (k1 )/W (k) H1W (k1 ) ; it is a W (k)-simple, adjoint\ngroup. Its Lie algebra (over W (k)) is Lie(H1 ) \u2297Zp W (k1 ). We consider the \u03c3-linear\nautomorphism a of it which acts identically on Lie(H1 ) and as \u03b3 on W (k1 ). HW (k1 ) is\na disjoint union of [k1 : k] copies of H1W (k1 ) ; but, as Gal(k1 /k) is not cyclic, the Lie\nalgebras of these copies of H1W (k1 ) are not permuted transitively by a \u2297 1.\nIn what follows, without special reference, we deal only with the cyclic notion.\n3.10.1. Definitions: cyclic factors. Any split Shimura adjoint (filtered) Lie\n\u03c3-crystal Cad is isomorphic to a direct sum of cyclic split Shimura adjoint (filtered)\nLie \u03c3-crystals, which are called the cyclic factors of Cad . The direct sum of the nontrivial cyclic factors is called the non-trivial part of Cad , while the direct sum of the\ntrivial ones is called the trivial part of Cad . Similarly, for any Shimura filtered \u03c3-crystal\n(M, F 1 , \u03c6, GM ) or Shimura \u03c3-crystal (M, \u03c6, GM ) (resp. for any Shimura filtered Lie \u03c3crystal (Lie(GM ), \u03c6, F 0 (Lie(GM )), F 1 (Lie(GM ))) or Shimura Lie \u03c3-crystal (Lie(GM ), \u03c6)),\nwith Gad\nM a split group, we define its cyclic Lie factors (resp. its cyclic factors), as well\nas its cyclic adjoint factors.\nFor instance, with the notations of the part of 3.4 ending with 3.4.1, the Shimura filtered Lie \u03c3-crystal (g0 , \u03c62 , F 0 (g0 ), F 1 (g0 )) of 3.4.1 is cyclic and is called a cyclic Lie factor\nof (M, F 1 , \u03c62 , G) (or a cyclic\nof (g, \u03c62 , F 0 (g), F 1 (g))); its adjoint (defined naturally\nQ factor\n1\nusing the Lie algebra of i\u2208I0 Gad\ni ) is called a cyclic adjoint factor of (M, F , \u03c62 , G) or\n0\n1\nof (g, \u03c62 , F (g), F (g)).\nSimilarly we speak about the non-trivial part (or the trivial part) of a split Shimura\n(filtered) Lie \u03c3-crystal L. Warning: they are not necessarily defined by direct summands\nof the underlying module of L.\n325\n\n\fSimilarly, for any Shimura (adjoint) (filtered) Lie \u03c3-crystal (resp. any Shimura (filtered) \u03c3-crystal), we speak about its weakly cyclic (adjoint) factors (resp. about its\nweakly cyclic Lie factors and its weakly cyclic adjoint factors) and about these factors\nbeing trivial or non-trivial. The only difference is: the adjoint groups we get are not\nalways products of absolutely simple, adjoint groups (cf. 3.10.0.1). Whenever possible,\nwe drop the word weakly.\n3.10.2. A context. From\u0001 now on we work with a cyclic Shimura adjoint filtered\nLie \u03c3-crystal g, \u03c6, F 0 (g), F 1 (g) which is non-trivial and has the property that there are\nLie algebras b and t of a Borel subgroup B of G and respectively of a maximal torus T\nof B, such that F 1 (g) \u2282 b \u2282 F 0 (g), \u03c6(t) = t and \u03c6(b) \u2282 b (to be compared with 3.2.3).\nHere G is as in 3.10.0.\nAll the terminology to be introduced below for the case G split is also used:\na) in the context of the above paragraph (via the passage to W (k\u0304)), and\nb) for cyclic factors of split Shimura filtered Lie \u03c3-crystals\ndefined by Shimura\u0001\n0\n1\ncanonical lifts (i.e. for factors like g0 , \u03c61 , F (g0 ), F (g0 ) of 3.4.1).\n\n3.10.3. Notations. From now on we also assume G is a split group. For not\noverloading the notations, we consider G = \u00d7i\u2208I0 Gi , g = g0 , F 0 (g) = F 0 (g0 ), F 1 (g) =\nF 1 (g0 ) (\"with g0 of 3.4.0\") and \u03c6 = \u03c61 (\"of 3.2.3\"). So we use fully the notations and\nconventions introduced in 3.4.0-3 and 3.4.5. So I \u0303 = I0 and G\u2032i = Gi , \u2200i \u2208 I0 . Warning:\nhere Gi are adjoint groups; so only the notations are as in the mentioned places (this\nmotivates the above use of quotation marks).\n3.10.4. The \u03b5-type. The m-tuple (\u03b51 , . . . , \u03b5m ) is called the \u03b5-type of (g0 , \u03c61 ). Here\nm := I \u03030 = e |I0 | \u2208 {|I|0 , 2 |I0 | , 3 |I0 |}.\nIf (g0 , \u03c61 ) is with involution or with a 3-cycle, then we replace (g0 , \u03c61 ) by\n(e)\n\n(ge0 , \u03c61 )\n(cf. 3.4.3.1) (e being 2 or 3, depending on \u03c01 being an involution or a 3-cycle). Here\n\u03b5i \u2208 S(0, l).\n(e)\n\n3.10.4.1. Warning. We replace (g0 , \u03c61 ) by (ge0 , \u03c61 ) only for defining the \u03b5type of (g0 , \u03c61 ). For formulas that follows (see 3.10.6) this replacement is not allowed\n(performed).\n3.10.4.2. On the value of m. If (g0 , \u03c61 ) is without a cycle, then the m-tuple\n(\u03b51 , . . . , \u03b5m ) is uniquely determined up to a cyclic permutation and up to a renumbering\nof the roots of \u22061 (cf. 3.4.3.2). We have m = n = |I0 |.\n326\n\n\fIf (g0 , \u03c61 ) is with involution then the m-tuple (\u03b51 , . . . , \u03b5m ) is uniquely determined up\nto a cyclic permutation and, in the case when g0 is of D4 Lie type, up to a renumbering\nof the roots of \u22061 . We have m = 2n.\nIf (g0 , \u03c61 ) is with a 3-cycle then the m-tuple (\u03b51 , . . . , \u03b5m ) is uniquely determined up\nto cyclic permutation and up to a renumbering of the roots of \u22061 . We have m = 3n.\nConvention. An \u03b5-type (\u03b51 , ..., \u03b5m) is said to be in the standard form, if\nPm 3.10.4.3.m\u2212i\n\u03b5\n(l+1)\nis the greatest number among all numbers obtained in this manner using\ni=1 i\nan \u03b5-type obtained from (\u03b51 , ..., \u03b5m) through the rules of 3.10.4.2 (i.e. up to renumberings\nand cyclic permutations). Here the role of l + 1 is irrelevant: we just need an integer\ngreater than all \u03b5i 's (to be compared with 2.2.22 3)). We always prefer to use \u03b5-types\nwhich are in the standard form (cf. also 2.2.22 3)). For instance, we prefer to consider\nthe \u03b5-type (1, 1, 0, 0) rather than the \u03b5-type (0, 0, 1, 1) and to consider the \u03b5-type (l, l \u2212\n1, 0, 1, 0) rather than (l \u2212 1, 0, 1, 0, l) or (1, 0, l, l \u2212 1, 0) (here l \u2265 4).\n3.10.4.4. Spreadings. We define A := {\u03b5i |i \u2208 I1 } and B := {\u03b5i |i \u2208 I \u03031 }. We\nhave |A| \u2264 |B| \u2264 e |A|. The numbers |A| and |B| are called the apparent spreading and\nrespectively the spreading of (g0 , \u03c61 ).\n3.10.5. Definitions. If \u03b5i 6= 0, \u2200i \u2208 S(1, m), then (g0 , \u03c61 ) is said to be of totally\nnon-compact type. If there is i \u2208 I0 such that \u03b5i = 0, then we say (g0 , \u03c61 ) has compact\nfactors or is of compact type.\nIf all \u03b5i , i \u2208 S(1, m), are equal and different from 0 (i.e. when |B| = 1 and I0 = I1 ),\nwe say (g0 , \u03c61 ) is totally non-compact of constant type, or totally non-compact of type:\ni) 1 if g0 is of Bl , Cl (l \u2265 1), D4 , E6 or E7 Lie type, or of Dl Lie type (l \u2265 5) with\n\u03b51 = 1.\nii) 2 if g0 is of Dl Lie type, with l \u2265 5, and \u03b51 \u2208 {l \u2212 1, l}.\niii) min{\u03b51 , 1 + l \u2212 \u03b51 } if g0 is of Al Lie type.\nIn case i) for g0 of Dl Lie type, with l \u2265 4, we also say (g0 , \u03c61 ) is totally non-compact\nof DlR type. In case ii) we also say (g0 , \u03c61 ) is totally non-compact of simple DlH type.\nSimilarly, if all non-zero \u03b5i 's are equal (i \u2208 S(1, m)) but there is i0 \u2208 I0 such that \u03b5i0 = 0,\nwe say (g0 , \u03c61 ) is of constant type, or of type 1 (or of DlR type), or of type 2 (or of simple\nDlH type), or of type min{\u03b5i , 1 + l \u2212 \u03b5i } (with i \u2208 I0 such that \u03b5i 6= 0) depending on which\nof the situations i) to iii) we are, but dropping (sometimes replacing by the expression\ncompact) the expression of totally non-compact type.\nIf |B| \u2265 2 we say (g0 , \u03c61 ) is of non-constant type. This can happen only when g0 is\nof Al (l \u2265 2), Dl (l \u2265 4) or E6 Lie type.\nIf g0 is of Dl Lie type, with B = {l \u2212 1, l}, or if g0 is of D4 Lie type, with |B| = 2,\nwe say (g0 , \u03c61 ) is of non-simple DlH type. The non-simple and the simple DlH types are\nalso referred as DlH types. In the cases when g0 is of D4 Lie type with |B| = 3, or of Dl\nLie type, with l \u2265 5 and |B| \u2265 2 but B 6= {l \u2212 1, l}, we say (g0 , \u03c61 ) is of mixed Dl type.\nIf g0 is of Dl Lie type with |B| = 3, that is with B = {1, l \u2212 1, l}, we say (g0 , \u03c61 ) is of\nstrongly mixed Dl type.\n327\n\n\fIf g0 is of Al Lie type with |B| \u2265 2, we say (g0 , \u03c61 ) is of {a, b} Al type, where\n1 \u2264 a < b \u2264 l and a \u2264 l + 1 \u2212 b and, if potentially changing l \u2212 i with i + 1, i = 0, l \u2212 1,\na is the smallest element of B and b is the greatest element of B.\nq1 := |I1 | is called the non-compact length of (g0 , \u03c61 ) and q0 := n = |I0 | is called the\ncyclic length of g0 . As we assumed (g0 , \u03c61 ) is non-trivial (see 3.10.2), we have q1 \u2265 1.\nBy the rank of (g0 , \u03c61 ) we mean the rank l \u2208 N of any simple Lie factor of g0 .\nMost of the above terminology is inspired from and conforms to [De2].\n3.10.5.1. The concentrated \u03b5-type. The eq0 -tuple \u03c4 c obtained from the \u03b5-type\n(\u03b51 , ..., \u03b5m ) by removing all zeros is referred as the concentrated \u03b5-type of (g0 , \u03c61 ). \u03c4 c is\ncalled oscillating if eq0 \u2265 2 and all its two consecutive elements (in the circular sense)\nare distinct. If |B| = 2 and \u03c4 c is oscillating, we say \u03c4 c is alternating. If \u03c4 c is alternating\nand if B is stable under the group of outer automorphisms of \u03a61 leaving invariant \u03a6+\n1,\nc\nwe say \u03c4 is involutive. For the A2 and E6 Lie type any oscillating concentrated \u03b5-type\nis automatically involutive (but this is not so for the Al and Dl Lie types, with l \u2265 3).\n3.10.6. Formulas. The formulas below are based:\n\u2013 on the list of hermitian symmetric domains and of their real dimension (see [He,\np. 518]), and on\n\u2013 the standard tables of roots of the simple, split, semisimple Lie algebras over a\nfield of characteristic 0 (see [Bou2, planche I-VI]).\nThere is nothing deep about the computations involved and so we mostly just list\nthe results. All below multiplicities are obtained by counting the roots of \u03a6+\n1 having\nin their expression (as sums with positive, integral coefficients of roots of \u22061 ) a specific\nsubset of \u22061 .\ni) Let g0 be of Bl , Cl or E7 Lie type.\nThe slopes of (g0 , \u03c61 ) are precisely \u2212 qq01 , 0 and qq01 . The multiplicity of qq10 is\nq0 dimC (X), where X is an irreducible hermitian symmetric domain whose group of automorphisms is of the same Lie type as g0 .\nIf g0 is of Cl Lie type, then dimC (X) =\n\nl(l+1)\n2\n\nl+1\n= dimW (k) (g1 ) 4l+2\n.\n\n2l\u22121\nIf g0 is of Bl Lie type, then dimC (X) = 2l \u2212 1 = dimW (k) (g1 ) 2l\n2 +l .\n\nIf g0 is of E7 Lie type, then dimC (X) = 27 =\n\n27\n133\n\ndimW (k) (g1 ).\n\nii) Let g0 be of E6 Lie type.\n8\n39\n\nCase 1. (g0 , \u03c61 ) is of type 1; then everything is as in i), with dimC (X) = 16 =\ndimW (k) (g1 ).\n\nCase 2. (g0 , \u03c61 ) is of non-constant type, without a cycle and with |I2 | =\n6 |I1 \\I2 |,\nwhere I2 := {i \u2208 I1 |\u03b5i = 1}. We can assume q2 := |I2 | > |I1 \\I2 |. The slopes of (g0 , \u03c61 )\n2\nare precisely \u2212 qq01 , \u2212 qq20 , \u2212q1q0+q2 , 0, q1q\u2212q\n, qq02 and qq10 .\n0\nThe multiplicities of the slopes\n\nq1 q2\nq0 , q0\n\nand\n328\n\nq1 \u2212q2\nq0\n\nare all equal to 8q0 .\n\n\fCase 3. (g0 , \u03c61 ) is of non-constant type with involution or is without a cycle but\n1\n,\nwith |I2 | = |I1 \\I2 | (with I2 as in Case 2).

(g0 , \u03c61 ) is of type 1 (i.e. of DlR type); then the situation is as in i), with\n2l\u22122\ndimC (X) = 2(l \u2212 1) = dimW (k) (g1 ) 2l\n2 \u2212l .\nCase 2.

Let Inv be the involution of the basis of\nroots of g1 (w.r.t. g1 \u2229 b) which takes \u03b1l\u22121 into \u03b1l (this fits the assumption\nq3 \u0001\u2265 q4 for\nP\n1\nl = 4). This implies q2 \u2265 1.

These numbers rJ1 have an entirely similar significance as\nthe similar numbers of Subcase 1.1.\nSubcase 2. (g0 , \u03c61 ) is not of strongly mixed type. So (g0 , \u03c61 ) is without an involution and l \u2265 5. This subcase is entirely analogous to Subcase 1.1, for the value\nq4 = 0.\nIn all these four cases the number of positive slopes is at most 7.\niv) Let g0 be of Al Lie type (l \u2265 2).\nCase 1. |B| = 1. This happens when |A| = 1 and (g0 , \u03c61 ) is without a cycle or\nwhen (g, \u03c61 ) is with involution and A = { l+1\n2 } (in this second situation l must be odd).\n330\n\n\fThe slopes are \u2212 qq10 , 0 and\n\nq1\nq0 .\n\nThe multiplicity of the slope\nto\n\n2\n\nq0 (l+1)\n4\n\nq1\nq0\n\nis i0 (l + 1 \u2212 i0 )q0 , where B = {i0 }.

A = {i0 , l + 1 \u2212 i0 } and (g0 , \u03c61 ) is with involution. This is entirely\nsimilar to Subcase 1.\nCase 3. |B| \u2265 3. So |A| \u2265 2. We do not treat this case here. We just mention two\nthings. The multiplicity of the greatest positive slope qq01 is i0 (l + 1 \u2212 i1 ), where i0 (resp.\ni1 ) is the smallest (resp. the greatest) element of B. The number of positive slopes is at\nmost\n2\n|B| + |B|\n.\n2\nWe get this by counting the equivalence classes of the following equivalence relation rB\n+\non \u03a6+\n1 . \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 \u03a61 are in relation rB iff in their expression as a sum of elements of \u22061\n\u03b1i shows up with the same coefficient, \u2200i \u2208 B: their number is exactly the number of\npositive slopes of the A|B| Lie type. Moreover, if (g0 , \u03c61 ) is with involution then in fact\nthe number of positive slopes is at most\n|B| + |B| + 2[ |B|+1\n2 ]\n,\n4\n2\n\ni.e. it is at most equal to the number of orbits of the natural action of the involution of\n\u03a61 leaving \u03a6+ invariant on the set of such equivalence classes. If q1 is big enough w.r.t.\n|B| one can check immediately that both these upper bounds can be attained.\n331\n\n\f3.10.7. Some facts. If the \u03b5-type of (g0 , \u03c61 ) is (\u03b51 , . . . , \u03b5m ), then p0 := W0 (g0 , \u03c61 )\n(resp. W 0 (g0 , \u03c61 )) is a direct sum of its intersection with the factors gi of g0 , i \u2208 I0 ,\nwhile its intersection with gi is the W (k)-module generated by ti and by the rank 1\n\u2212\nW (k)-submodules corresponding \u2013in the sense of 3.4.3.2\u2013 to all roots of \u03a6+\ni (resp. of \u03a6i )\nand to those negative (resp. positive) roots not having \u2212\u03b1\u03b5j (i) (resp. \u03b1\u03b5j (i)) in their\nexpression, for any j \u2208 S(1, m) such that \u03b5j 6= 0; this is a consequence of 3.4.3.0 via the\nnumbering in 3.4.3.2.\nUsing this we get directly the following Facts:\nF0. We fix the Lie type of g0 . Then q10 times the number of slopes 0 of (g0 , \u03c61 )\ndepends only on the set of non-zero elements \u03b5j 's (j \u2208 S(1, m)).\nF1. p0 \u2229 gi is a maximal parabolic Lie subalgebra of gi iff (g0 , \u03c61 ) is of constant type.\nF2. p0 = F 0 (g0 ) iff (g0 , \u03c61 ) is totally non-compact of constant type (i.e. iff (g0 , \u03c61 )\nis an ordinary Shimura Lie \u03c3-crystal).\nF3. p0 is a Borel Lie subalgebra of g iff g0 is of Al Lie type with B = S(1, l). Here\nl \u2265 1.\nF4. The Lie stable p-rank of (g0 , \u03c61 ) is always positive and divisible by q0 . It is q0\n(i.e. the refined Lie stable p-rank (g0 , \u03c61 ) is the 1-tuple (1)) iff g0 is of Al Lie type with\n{1, l} \u2282 B.\n\u0001\nWhen the situation of F 3 takes place, we say that g0 , \u03c61 , F 0 (g0 ), F 1 (g0 ) is of strong\nBorel type (cf. 2.2.12 c)) or that it has maximal A-spreading. Also, for future references\nwe state explicitly the following obvious fact:\nF5. (g0 , \u03c61 ) is totally non-compact iff its multiplicity of slope \u22121 (or 1) is non-zero.\n3.10.8. An interpretation in terms of p-divisible groups. We consider a pdivisible group D over W (k) having (b, F 1 (g0 ), \u03c61 ) as its associated filtered \u03c3-crystal, cf.\n2.2.12.1 1). The positive slopes and their multiplicities as listed in 3.10.6, are precisely\nthe positive slopes and their multiplicities of the special fibre Dk of D.\n3.10.8.1. The a-invariant. Let a(g0 , \u03c61 ) := a(Dk ) (cf. 2.1). We refer to it as the\na-invariant of (g0 , \u03c61 ). As the a-number is not changed by field extensions, we similarly\ndefine the a-invariant of any Shimura Lie \u03c3-crystal which has a lift of parabolic type.\nExercise. Show that the a-invariant of (g0 , \u03c61 ) is the same as the a-invariant of the\nextension to k\u0304 of its canonical lift as defined in 2.3.18.3 2). Hint: use Exercise of 2.2.22.1.\n3.11. The case k = k\u0304 and applications. We use the notations of 3.1-2. We\nassume (M, \u03c6, G, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ) is a G-ordinary \u03c3-crystal.\n3.11.1. Theorem. Let C = (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ) be the G-canonical lift of\n(M, \u03c6, G, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ). We assume k = k\u0304. We have:\na) C is cyclic diagonalizable;\n332\n\n\fb) its Shimura filtered Lie \u03c3-crystal is cyclic diagonalizable and of Borel and parabolic\ntype;\n\u0001\nc) it is 1J -isomorphic to M, F 1 , \u03c61 , G, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J mentioned in 3.2.3.\nProof: There are many ways in proving c). One way is entirely the same as the\nproof of b) of 4.4.1 2) (cf. also the extra details needed for the proof of b) of 4.4.1 3))\nbelow, made in the context of a SHS. As the referred proof is self contained (based on\n3.4.11), this way is not repeated here (cf. the policy of 1.14.2). A second way is to\ncombine 3.6.17 with 3.4.11.\nFor the convenience of the reader we present a third way, based on 3.6.17, 3.4.11 and\n3.1.0 c). We can assume \u03c6 = g\u03c61 , with g \u2208 P1 (W (k))) (see 3.3.2 for the meaning of P1 ).\nWe need to find h \u2208 P1 (W (k)) such that\n(1)\n\nhg\u03c61 = \u03c61 h.\n\nThe case when g is congruent to the identity mod p is entirely the same as the part of\nthe proof of 3.6.17 referring to the W (k)-base B0 and to induction.\nLet R1 be the Zariski closure of the reductive subgroup of P1B(k) whose Lie algebra\nis W (0)(g, \u03c61 ). From Fact 1 of 2.2.9 1) we get that (M, F 1 , \u03c61 , T ) is cyclic diagonalizable.\nSo from 2.2.19.2 we get that R1 is a Levi subgroup of P1 (more precisely: R1 is the only\nLevi subgroup of P1 containing T ). So P1 is the semidirect product of its unipotent\nradical N1 and of R1 . To treat the general case, we write\ng = g 1 n1\nwith g1 \u2208 R1 (W (k)) and n1 \u2208 N1 (W (k)). As k = k\u0304, R1 has a canonical Zp -structure:\nthe part of 3.4.3.0 (1) referring to si (\u03b1)'s implies that \u03bc centralizes R1 and so this Zp structure is obtained as in 2.2.9 8); so, as R1 is canonically identified with P1 /N1 , [Bo2,\n16.4] implies that we can assume g1 is congruent to the identity mod p. N1 is a normal\nsubgroup of P1 normalized by T . Moreover it is unipotent; so there is a finite sequence\nof characteristic subgroups\nNm \u2282 Nm\u22121 \u2282 ... \u2282 N1\nof N1 such that Ni /Ni+1 = Gami , \u2200i \u2208 S(1, m), with m, mi \u2208 N\u222a{0} and with Nm+1 as the\ntrivial subgroup. Let Ui be a subgroup of Ni normalized by T and such that the resulting\nhomomorphism Ui \u2192 Ni /Ni+1 is an isomorphism. We have \u03c6(Lie(Ui )) \u2282 Lie(Ui ) (cf.\n3.4.3.0 (1) and the fact that each Ni is a characteristic subgroup of N1 ). Moreover,\n\u2200i \u2208 S(1, m), we have\n\u03c6li (Lie(Ui )) \u2282 pLie(Ui ),\nfor some li \u2208 N \u222a {0} (cf. 3.4.3.0 (1); this is just the version of the Key Fact of the\nproof of 3.6.6 which involves positive \u2013versus negative\u2013 slopes). Using this, by repeatedly\nreplacing g\u03c6 with n2 g\u03c6n\u22121\n2 , with n2 \u2208 Ui (W (k)), where i \u2208 S(1, m) is the biggest number\nsuch that n1 mod p is a k-valued point of Ni , we get that we can assume n1 is congruent\nto the identity mod p. So g is congruent to the identity mod p. This proves c).\n333\n\n\fTo prove a) and b), we recall (cf. 3.2.3) that \u03c61 (t \u2297W (k) W (k\u0304)) = t \u2297W (k) W (k\u0304). So,\nas k = k\u0304, t is generated by elements fixed by \u03c61 . Considering the family of tensors of\nT (M [ p1 ]) formed by such elements and by the members of the family (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J , we get a\nconcrete way to see that the quadruple (M, F 1 , \u03c61 , T ) is a Shimura filtered \u03c3-crystal. So\na) results from this and from c) (cf. 2.2.16). b) results from c) and the fact that k = k\u0304\n(cf. 3.4.3.0 (1) and 2.2.12.1 4)). This proves the Theorem.\n3.11.2. First applications. A. From 3.11.1 c) we get 3.1.4. This goes as follows.\nThe uniqueness part is implied by 3.2.8; it allows us to assume that in 3.1.4 we have\nk = k\u0304. But referring to (M, F 1 , \u03c61 , G), we can take \u03bc\u0303 = \u03bc, cf. 3.4.3.0.\nB. Let now \u03bcy : Gm \u2192 G be the canonical split of (M, \u03c6, G) (cf. 3.1.6). We\nwrite \u03c6 = a \u25e6 \u03bcy ( p1 ), with a as a \u03c3-linear automorphism of M . We assume k = k\u0304. So\nM a := {x \u2208 M |a(x) = x} defines a Zp -structure on M . Let h\u03041 \u2208 End(M ) be defined\nby: h\u03041 (x) = x if x \u2208 F 1 \u0001and h\u03041 (x) = 0 if Gm through \u03bcy acts trivially on x. We have\nh\u03041 \u2208 End M a \u2297Zp W (F) and there is d \u2208 N such that \u03c6d (h\u03041 ) = h\u03041 but \u2200i \u2208 N, i < d,\nwe have \u03c6i (h\u03041 ) 6= h\u03041 ; all these are a consequence of 3.11.1 a) (cf. also 2.2.16.4). So \u03bcy\ncan be viewed as an injective cocharacter\n\u0001\n\u03bcy : Gm \u0592\u2192 GW (Fpd ) \u2282 GL M a \u2297Zp W (Fpd ) .\nLet Fd1 := F 1 \u2229 M a \u2297Zp W (Fpd ); we have F 1 = Fd1 \u2297W (Fpd ) W (k). Let \u03c6i (h\u03041 ) = h\u0304i+1 ,\n\u2200i \u2208 N. So hi+1 = ai (h\u03041 ) and h\u0304d+1 = h\u03041 . The h\u0304i 's are commuting among themselves\n(as they belong to Lie(T )). As in 2.2.9 8), let GZp be the subgroup of GL(M a ) whose\nextension to W (k) is the subgroup G of GL(M a \u2297Zp W (k)) = GL(M ).\nWe get (cf. 2.2.16.4 a)): (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ) is isomorphic to the extension to\nW (k) of the following strongly cyclic diagonalizable Shimura filtered \u03c3Fpd -crystal\n\u0001\n1\nMM := M a \u2297Zp W (Fpd ), Fd1 , \u03c3Fpd \u25e6 \u03bcy ( ), GW (Fpd ) , (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ;\np\nhere \u03c3Fpd acts trivially on M a and as Frobenius on W (Fpd ). We refer to MM as the\nminimal model of (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ), cf. also Fact of 2.2.16.4; from its construction\nwe get it is uniquely determined.\n\u0001d\n\u03c3Fpd \u25e6 \u03bcy ( p1 ) is a B(Fpd )-linear automorphism of M a \u2297Zp B(Fpd ); so it can be\nidentified with an element of GW (Fpd ) (B(Fpd )) and so of G(K0 ). As h\u0304i 's are commuting\n\u0001d\namong themselves, we get immediately that in fact \u03c3Fpd \u25e6 \u03bcy ( p1 ) is a Qp -linear automorphism of M a [ p1 ] defined by a Qp -valued point of the smallest torus of GQp through\nwhose extension to B(Fpd ) \u03bcy factors; in particular, it is semisimple.\nC. Let P=0 be the subgroup of GZp whose extension to W (Fpd ) is the centralizer\nof h\u03041 ,..., h\u0304d ; it is connected as its extension to W (Fpd ) is the centralizer of the torus of\nGW (Fpd ) generated by the image of \u03bc and by the conjugates under \u03c3Fpd of this image\n334\n\n\f(cf. [Bo2, 11.12] applied over B(Fpd ) and over Fpd ). Lie(P=0 ) \u2282 g is the Lie algebra\nover Zp of endomorphisms of (M, \u03c6, G) or of (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G) (one inclusion is obvious from\nconstructions; the other one results from 3.1.1.2 and 3.1.4-5); even more, its extension\nto W (Fpd ) is W (0)(Lie(GW (Fpd ) ), \u03c3Fpd \u25e6 \u03bcy ( p1 )): all these can be read out as well from\n3.4.3.0 (via 3.11.1 c)). From 3.4.3.0 (1) we also get that we have the following slope sign\ndirect sum decomposition\n(SSDSD)\n\n1\n(Lie(GW (Fpd ) ), F 0 (Lie(GW (Fpd ) )), F 1 (Lie(GW (Fpd ) )), \u03c3Fpd \u25e6 \u03bcy ( )) =\np\n1\n= (Lie(P=0W (Fpd ) ), Lie(P=0W (Fpd ) ), 0, \u03c3Fpd \u25e6 \u03bcy ( ))\u2295\np\n\n1\n\u2295(Lie(N>0 ), Lie(N>0 ), F 1 (Lie(GW (Fpd ) )) \u2229 Lie(N>0 ), \u03c3Fpd \u25e6 \u03bcy ( ))\u2295\np\n1\n\u2295(Lie(N<0 ), F 0 (Lie(GW (Fpd ) )) \u2229 Lie(N<0 ), 0, \u03c3Fpd \u25e6 \u03bcy ( ))\np\nas p-divisible objects of MF[\u22121,1](W (Fpd )): the first (resp. the second and the third)\ndirect sum factor is in fact a p-divisible object of MF[0,0] (W (Fpd )) (resp. is a p-divisible\nobject of MF[0,1](W (Fpd )) and of MF[\u22121,0] (W (Fpd ))); here N<0 (resp. N>0 ) is the\nintegral, connected, smooth, unipotent subgroup of GW (Fpd ) whose Lie algebra is the\nLie subalgebra of Lie(GW (Fpd ) ) corresponding to negative (resp. positive) slopes of\n(Lie(GW (Fpd ) ), \u03c3Fpd \u25e6 \u03bcy ( p1 )). N>0 and N<0 have natural Zp -structures: they are obtained from subgroups of GZp by extension of scalars (cf. end of B above).\nEven better, 3.4.3.0 (1) implies: we actually get slope type direct sum decompositions\n(ST DSD)\n1\n(Lie(GW (Fpd ) ), F 0 (Lie(GW (Fpd ) )), F 1 (Lie(GW (Fpd ) )), \u03c3Fpd \u25e6 \u03bcy ( )) = \u2295\u03b1\u2208S C\u03b1 ,\np\nwhere S is the set of slopes of (Lie(GW (Fpd ) ), \u03c3Fpd \u25e6 \u03bcy ( p1 )) and C\u03b1 is a p-divisible object\nof MF[0,1](W (Fpd )) if \u03b1 > 0, of MF[0,0] (W (Fpd )) if \u03b1 = 0, and of MF[\u22121,0] (W (Fpd )) if\n\u03b1 < 0; moreover the Newton polygon of C\u03b1 has only one slope: \u03b1. So, STDSD \"isolates\"\nentirely all slopes of S and not only their signs (as the decomposition (SSDSD) does).\nDeclaring Cs to be the zero p-divisible object if s \u2208 [\u22122, 2] \\ S, w.r.t. the Lie structure of\nLie(GW (Fpd ) ) we have natural inclusions\n[C\u03b1 , C\u03b2 ] \u2282 C\u03b1+\u03b2\nof p-divisible objects of MF[\u22122,2] (W (k)); here \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 S.\nD. Let B be a Borel subgroup of G normalizing F 1 and such that \u03c6(Lie(B)) \u2282 Lie(B)\n(cf. the Borel type property of 3.11.1 b)). There are many ways to see that \u03bcy factors\nthrough B (for instance, using the end of 2.2.12.1 1) and the fact that B is its own\n335\n\n\fnormalizer in G, or using the functoriality of canonical splits, etc.). So a(Lie(B)) =\nLie(B). Let BZp be the Borel subgroup of GZp which is the Zp -structure of B defined\nnaturally by a. So BZp normalizes \u03c6i (F 1 ), \u2200i \u2208 N, and so we have:\nFact. h\u0304i is G(B(k))-conjugate to h\u03041 , iff h\u0304i = h\u03041 , i.e. iff d|i \u2212 1.\nLet A h\u03041 (resp. T h\u03041 ) be the image of h\u03041 in Lie(Gad ) (resp. in Lie(Gab )), and let\nd1 \u2208 N (resp. d2 \u2208 N) be the smallest positive integer such that A h\u03041 (resp. T h\u03041 ) is the\nimage of h\u0304d1 +1 in Lie(Gad ) (resp. the image of h\u0304d2 +1 in Lie(Gab )). Then d1 and d2 divide\nd, and in fact d = l.c.m.[d1 , d2 ].\n3.11.3. Degrees of definition. Referring to 3.11.2 D, the number d is called the\u0001\ndegree of definition of (M, \u03c6, G), d1 is called the degree of definition of Lie(Gad ), \u03c6\nor the A-degree\nof definition of (M, \u03c6, G), and d2 is called the degree of definition of\n\u0001\nab\nLie(G ), \u03c6 or the T -degree of definition of (M, \u03c6, G). Here A- and T - stand for adjoint\nand respectively toric. d is the same as the degree of definition of (M, F 1 , \u03c6) as def. in\n2.2.16.4. Moreover, as N>0 is a non-trivial group (see 3.2.2.1), the A-degree of definition\nof (M, \u03c6, G) is equal to the A-degree of definition of the (non-trivial) Shimura adjoint\nfiltered Lie \u03c3-crystal attached to (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G) as defined in the end of 2.2.16.5.\n3.11.3.1. Corollary. Let g \u2208 G(W (k)) and Tg a maximal torus of G be such that\n(M, g\u03c6, Tg ) is a quasi Shimura \u03c3-crystal. Then the degree of definition dg of (M, g\u03c6, Tg )\nis a multiple of d.\nProof: This Corollary is very much related to 2.2.16.4; however, it is not implied\ndirectly by the mentioned place. We can assume k = k\u0304; so we can drop the word quasi and\nmoreover we can assume Tg = T . Let \u03bcT : Gm \u2192 T be the unique cocharacter producing\na direct sum decomposition M = FT1 \u2295 FT0 (with \u03b2 \u2208 Gm (W (k)) acting through it on FTi\nas the multiplication with \u03b2 \u2212i , i = 0, 1) such that (M, FT1 , g\u03c6, T ) is a Shimura filtered\n\u03c3-crystal. Writing g\u03c6 = aT \u25e6 \u03bcT ( p1 ), aT is a \u03c3-linear automorphism of M . As in 3.11.2\nB, let TZp (resp. G\u0303Zp ) be the Zp -structure of T (resp. of G) it defines naturally. G\u0303Zp is\nan inner form of GZp and so from Lang's theorem, we get that in fact we have a natural\nidentification GZp = G\u0303Zp . As TZp is a torus of G\u0303Zp , from 2.2.16.4 a) we get (cf. also\nFact 2 of 2.2.9 3)) that the G(W (k))-conjugacy class of the cocharacter \u03bcy of 3.11.2 is\ndefinable over W (Fpdg ). Let d1 := (dg , d). From [Mi3, 4.6-7] we deduce that this class is\ndefinable over W (Fpd1 ). So, as h\u0304i = \u03c3Fi\u22121\n(h\u03041 ) (see 3.11.2 B), from the Fact of 3.11.2 D\npd\nwe get d1 = d. This proves the Corollary.\n3.11.3.2. Remark. We consider a potentially cyclic diagonalizable Shimura filtered\n\u03c3k1 -crystal over a finite field k1 . Warning: the degree of definition of its extension to\nk1 = F is not necessarily a divisor of the degree [k1 : Fp ]; easy examples can be obtained\nby considering an elliptic curve E over Q which has supersingular good reduction w.r.t.\np and is such that EQ has complex multiplication.\n3.11.4. An application: more on the numbers d(n) of 3.6.1.3 2). We come\nback to the notations of 3.1-4. 3.11.1 allows us to define the number\nr((M, \u03c6, G)) \u2208 N \u222a {0}\n336\n\n\fas the number of slopes \u22121 of the Lie \u03c3-crystal of any G-canonical lift produced by\n(M, \u03c6, G). Directly from 3.6.18.7.0 we get: \u2200n \u2208 N we have the estimate\n(EST 1)\n\nd(n) \u2264 dimW (k) (G)r((M, \u03c6, G)).\n\nThe numbers r((M, \u03c6, G)) can be easily computed using 3.10.6. As a very gross estimate\nwe have 3r((M, \u03c6, G)) \u2264 dimW (k) (G) (cf. the formulas of 3.10.6: see i), ii), Cases 1 and\n2 of iii), and Case 1 of iv); see 3.10.7 for why the situation gets reduced to the constant\ntype context of 3.10.5). So we get\n(EST 2)\n\nd(n) \u2264\n\ndimW (k) (G)2\n;\n3\n\nif G = GL(M ), then in the above inequality we can replace the denominator 3 by 4\n(cf. the last part of Case 1 of 3.10.6 iv)). In many situations, we can get much better\nestimates than the above gross estimate: for instance, see Case 2) of 3.10.6 ii).\nIn particular, if r((M, \u03c6, G)) = 0 then d(n) = 0, \u2200n \u2208 N (his result matches 3.6.18.8.1\na)). So in such a case we can take Qj,n = Rj , \u2200n \u2208 N. There are plenty of examples with\nr((M, \u03c6, G)) = 0; we mention here two such situations of general nature:\n1) the case when none of the adjoint cyclic factors of the G-canonical lift (M, F 1 , \u03c60 , G)\nof (M, \u03c60 , G) are totally non-compact;\n2) the situations pertaining to a SHS to be referred in 4.6.1 1) below.\n3.11.5. Remark. 3.11.1 c) and 3.1.3 a) imply: (M, \u03c6, G) has constant isogeny class\n(cf. def. of 2.2.22 2)).\n3.11.6. The Lie variant of 3.11.1. Referring to the abstract context of 2.2.11\n(i.e. we move away from the context of Shimura \u03c3-crystals, even if we use very similar\nnotations) we have the following Lie variant of 3.11.1:\nCorollary. A) We assume k = k\u0304. If (g, \u03c6, F 0 (g), F 1 (g)) is a Shimura filtered Lie \u03c3crystal of Borel type, then for any g \u2208 Gad (W (k)) such that (g, g\u03c6) has the same Newton\npolygon as (g, \u03c6), the Shimura Lie \u03c3-crystals (g, g\u03c6) and (g, \u03c6) are both isomorphic under\nan isomorphism defined by an element of Gad (W (k)).\nB) A Shimura filtered Lie \u03c3-crystal (g, \u03c6, F 0 (g), F 1 (g)) of Borel type is of parabolic\ntype. If k = k\u0304, then the converse holds. Moreover, for k arbitrary and (g, \u03c6) non-trivial,\nthere is a unique injective cocharacter \u03bc : Gm \u0592\u2192 Gad as in 2.2.11 1) and such that the\nparabolic Lie subalgebra of g corresponding to non-positive (resp. to non-negative) slopes\nof (g, \u03c6) is contained in g0 \u2295 g\u22121 (resp. in g0 \u2295 g1 ); it is the canonical split cocharacter\nof (g, \u03c6, F 0 (g), F 1 (g)).\nC) If k = k\u0304, then any Shimura filtered Lie \u03c3-crystal of Borel type is cyclic diagonalizable.\nProof: A) is a consequence of 3.5.5: we just need to use the same argument as in\nthe proof of 3.11.1 c). Using A) and just interpreting (i.e. restating) 3.2.3, 3.2.8, 3.4.3.0\nand 3.11.2 A in terms of Lie algebras, B) and C) follow.\n337\n\n\f3.11.6.1. Definitions. A non-trivial Shimura Lie \u03c3-crystal which has a lift of\nparabolic type, is called a Shimura-ordinary Lie \u03c3-crystal, while this lift (as in 3.2.8,\nbased on the part of 2.2.11.1 referring to 2.2.9 3), we get that it is unique) is called\nits Shimura-canonical lift. A cocharacter \u03bc as in B) above is called the canonical split\nof (g, \u03c6). Similarly, following the pattern of 3.1.1, we speak about generalized Shimura\np-divisible objects over k which are Shimura-ordinary, as well as about their Shimuracanonical lifts and about their canonical split cocharacters.\n3.11.6.2. Remarks. 1) Referring to the Corollary of 3.11.6, it is worth pointing out\nanother way to get the first sentence of B). Let p\u22650 , p>0 and p<0 be the Lie subalgebras\nof g corresponding respectively to non-negative, positive and negative slopes of (g, \u03c6).\nWe can assume k = k\u0304. The Borel type part implies F 1 (g) \u2282 p>0 (cf. 2.2.12.1 1)); so\np1 \u2282 p2 (cf. Fact of 2.2.11.1). We conclude (based on 2.2.3 3)) p\u22650 \u2282 F 0 (g0 ).\n2) We refer to 2.2.12.1 1). The p-divisible group D+ over W (k) whose associated\nfiltered \u03c3-crystal is (p>0 , F 1 (g), \u03c6) is called the positive p-divisible group of (g, \u03c6).\nSimilarly, as\nF 1 (g0 ) \u2282 p>0 \u2282 p\u22650 \u2282 F 0 (g0 ),\nthe triple\n(p<0 , F 0 (g) \u2229 p<0 , p\u03c6)\nis a filtered \u03c3-crystal; warning: here F 0 (g) \u2229 p<0 is viewed as an F 1 -filtration of p<0 . The\np-divisible group D\u2212 over W (k) having it as its associated filtered \u03c3-crystal, is called\nthe negative p-divisible group of (g, \u03c6). From the description of the permutation \u03b3\u03a6 of\n3.4.3.0, we get:\nFact. If k = k\u0304, then D\u2212 is the dual of D+ .\n3) 3.11.6 forces us to come back to 3.10.8. We assume k = k\u0304 and we use the\nnotations of 1) and 2). 3.11.6 C) implies that the filtered \u03c3-crystal (p>0 , F 1 (g), \u03c6) is\ncyclic diagonalizable. It is easy to compute its classification invariants starting from\n3.10.6. For instance, if (g, \u03c6) is cyclic of Bl , Cl or E7 Lie type, from 3.10.6 i) we get:\n(p>0 , F 1 (g), \u03c6) is a direct sum of dimC (X)-copies of the circular diagonalizable filtered\n\u03c3-crystal having its type equal to the \u03b5-type of (g, \u03c6), and so we just have to decompose\nthe \u03b5-type into indecomposable types (as in 2.2.22 3)); here X is the hermitian symmetric\ndomain associated to the Lie type of g, while l \u2208 N.\nSimilar direct sum decompositions can be obtained for the context of 3.10.6 ii) to\niv). However, in the Case 3 of 3.10.6 iv), they can be very complicated; in particular,\nthe \u03b5-type is not enough to describe (directly, i.e. without using [Bou2, planche I]) the\nisomorphism classes of the direct summands (see D of 2.2.22 3)) of (p>0 , F 1 (g), \u03c6).\n3.11.7. Groups of automorphisms. Let (M, \u03c6, G, (t\u03b1)\u03b1\u2208J ) be a G-ordinary \u03c3crystal and let F 1 be its canonical lift. We first assume k = k\u0304. Let h\u0304i 's, P=0 and MM\nbe as in 3.11.2 B and C. Let MMF be the extension of MM to F. The group Aut0\n(resp. Aut1 ) of automorphisms (resp. of 1J -automorphisms) of (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G) (resp.\n338\n\n\fof (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J )) is the same as the group of automorphisms (resp. \u0001 of 1J automorphisms) of (M a \u2297Zp W (F), Fd1 \u2297W (Fpd ) W (F), \u03c3Fpd \u25e6 \u03bcy ( p1 ) \u2297 1, GW (F) (resp.\nof MMF ). From 3.11.2 C we get that Aut1 is the group of Zp -valued points of P=0 .\n1\nSimilarly, let P=0\nbe the maximal closed subgroup of the normalizer of GZp in GL(M a ),\nwhose extension to W (Fpd ) centralizes h\u0304i , i = 1, d. From 3.1.5.1 we get:\n1\nCorollary. Aut0 is the group of Zp -valued points of P=0\n.\n\nLet Aut2 be the group of automorphisms of the positive (or negative) p-divisible\ngroup of (g, F 0 (g), F 1 (g), \u03c6) or of the positive (or negative) p-divisible group of the\nShimura filtered \u03c3-crystal attached to MMF . It can be as well interpreted as the group\nof Zp -valued points of an integral, affine group scheme over Zp (cf. the Zp -structures of\nN>0 and of N<0 mentioned in 3.11.2 C). The group Auts , with s \u2208 {0, 1, 2}, is referred\nas the s-th group of automorphisms of (M, F 1 , G, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ).\n3.11.8. The case of a perfect field. With k just perfect, similarly to 3.11.2-3,\nfor (M, \u03c6, G, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ) we define its degree of definition d \u2208 N as well as its A-degree and\nT -degree of definition. We have:\nLemma. k contains Fpd .\nProof: If k is finite, this can be checked using entirely the same ideas as in the proof\nof 3.11.3.1. To see the general case, it is enough to show that the smallest Lie subalgebra\nof Lie(GB(k) ) taken by \u03c6 into itself and containing d\u03bc, with \u03bc : Gm \u2192 G as the canonical\nsplit of (M, \u03c6, G), is generated by elements fixed by \u03c6. But this Lie algebra is a Lie\nsubalgebra of the Lie algebra of the maximal torus of the center of P\u22650 \u2229 P\u22640 , with P\u22650\n(resp. P\u22640 ) as the parabolic subgroup of GB(k) whose Lie algebra is W0 (Lie(GB(k) ), \u03c6)\n(resp. is W 0 (Lie(GB(k) ), \u03c6)) (this can be seen over k\u0304; so 3.11.2 C applies). As P\u22650 and\nP\u22640 are parabolic subgroups of GB(k) , the Lemma follows by transferring everything (via\nFontaine's comparison theory) into the \u00e9tale context with Qp -coefficients (cf. also 2.2.12.1\n1) and 3.11.6.2 2); see also (SSDSD) of 3.11.2 C).\n\u0001\nLet MM := M a \u2297Zp W (Fpd ), Fd1 , \u03c3Fpd \u25e6 \u03bcy ( p1 ), GW (Fpd ) , (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J be the minimal\nmodel of the extension of (M, \u03c6, G, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ) to k\u0304. Let Auts be the s-th group of automorphisms of this extension.\nThe Lemma implies that we have a natural action of Gal(k) on Auti , i \u2208 {0, 1, 2}: it is\nthe trivial action (cf. the existence of Zp -structures in 3.11.7). How \"far\" is (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G)\n(resp. (M, \u03c6, G, (t\u03b1)\u03b1\u2208J )) from being isomorphic (resp. 1J -isomorphic) to the extension\nof MM to k, is measured by a class\n\u03b3 \u2208 H 1 (Gal(k), Aut0 )\n(resp. \u03b31 \u2208 H 1 (Gal(k), Aut1 )).\nAs in 3.11.6.2 we define the positive D+ and the negative D\u2212 p-divisible group of\n(g, F 0 (g), F 1 (g), \u03c6). As above, how \"far\" is D+ from being isomorphic to the extension\n339\n\n\fto k of the positive p-divisible group of the Shimura filtered \u03c3-crystal attached to MM,\nis measured by a class\n\u03b32 \u2208 H 1 (Gal(k), Aut2 ).\nWe say (M, \u03c6, G) or (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G) is balanced if \u03b32 is the 0 class. It is easy to see that\nthere are examples when (M, \u03c6, G) is balanced but \u03b31 is not the 0 class; for instance, this\nis the case if k = Fp , M is of rank 2 over Zp , G = GL(M ) and we replace (M, F 1 , \u03c6) by\n(M a , Fd1 , \u03b2M \u03bcy ( p1 )), where \u03b2M is the scalar automorphism of M defined by an invertible\nelement of Zp which is not a p \u2212 1-th power.\nIt can be checked using quite involved matrix computations that the positive and\nthe negative p-divisible group of (g, F 0 (g), F 1 (g), \u03c6) are dual to each other. However,\nhere we take a faster approach, though slightly restricted. We have the following obvious\nresult:\nFact. We assume (g, F 0 (g), F 1 (g), \u03c6) or its adjoint is a symmetric p-divisible\nobject of MF[\u22121,1] (W (k)). Then the positive and the negative p-divisible group of\n(g, \u03c6, F 0 (g), F 1 (g)) are dual to each other.\nSee 2.2.23 and the beginning paragraph of 3.4 for how practical this Fact is. For\ninstance, it applies if the Killing form on Lie(Gad ) is perfect.\n3.11.8.1. Direct sum decompositions. We have slope sign (resp. slope type)\ndirect sum decompositions similar to (SSDSD) (resp. of (STDSD)) of 3.11.2 C, for any\nShimura filtered Lie \u03c3-crystal (g, \u03c6, F 0 (g), F 1 (g)) of parabolic type over k. This is a\nconsequence of 3.11.6 B, by natural passage from k to k\u0304 (cf. also Lemma of 2.2.3 3)).\nSuch (SSDSD)'s represent an improvement to 2.2.12.1 1). Based on (STDSD), we can\nuniquely associate a Galois representation to (g, F 0 (g), F 1 (g), \u03c6): it is a direct sum of\nGalois representations indexed by the slopes of (g, \u03c6). For instance, referring to (STDSD)\nof 3.11.2 C, it is the direct sum\n\u2295\u03b1\u2208S \u03c1\u03b1 ,\nwhere \u03c1\u03b1 is the Galois representation associated (via Fontaine's comparison theory) to\nC\u03b1 .\nWe assume now that (g, \u03c6, F 0 (g), F 1 (g)) is the Shimura filtered Lie \u03c3-crystal attached to a G-canonical lift (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G, (t\u03b1)\u03b1\u2208J ). Let \u03c1 : \u0393k \u2192 GL(N )(Zp ) be the Galois representation associated to (M, F 1 , \u03c6) via Fontaine's comparison theory; this is the\nsixth place where we need p \u2265 3. Let v\u03b1 \u2208 T (N [ p1 ]) correspond to t\u03b1 via Fontaine's comparison theory and let GN be the Zariski closure in GL(N ) of the subgroup of GL(N [ p1 ])\nfixing v\u03b1 , \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 J . We denote by \u03c1G the factorization of \u03c1 through GN (Zp ). Corresponding to (STDSD) of (g, F 0 (g), F 1 (g), \u03c6), we get via Fontaine's comparison theory\na direct sum decomposition Lie(GN )[ p1 ] = \u2295\u03b1\u2208S L\u0303\u03b1 in Qp -vector spaces left invariant\n(under Ad(Zp ) \u25e6 \u03c1G ) by \u0393k .\nTo show that it extends to an \u00e9tale slope type direct sum decomposition\n(EST DSD)\n\nLie(GN ) = \u2295\u03b1\u2208S L\u03b1\n340\n\n\fof \u0393k -submodules, with L\u03b1 := L\u0303\u03b1 \u2229 Lie(GN ), we can assume k = k\u0304. Let P=0W (k) be\nthe subgroup of G defined as the extension to W (k) of a reductive group P=0 over Zp\nconstructed as in 3.11.2 C (as a subgroup of a natural Zp -model of G), and let T be a\nmaximal torus of it whose Lie algebra is generated by elements fixed by \u03c6. As in the end\nof the proof of 3.11.1 we get that (M, F 1 , \u03c6, T ) is a Shimura filtered \u03c3-crystal. Moreover,\nas in 2.2.16.5 (cf. also [Va2, 4.3.13]), based on [Va2, 4.3.9] and the functorial aspect of\nFontaine's comparison theory, we get that via this theory, to T it corresponds a maximal\ntorus T0 of GN . As in the proof of 2.2.16.2 we have a natural identification\n(T OR)\n\nLie(T ) = Lie(T0W (k) ).\n\nArgument: both sides of (TOR) can be identified with the extension to W (k) of the Lie\nalgebra of endomorphisms of (M, F 1 , \u03c6, T ). So we can assume \u03c1G factors through the\ngroup of Zp -valued points of T0 . Moreover, L\u03b1 is normalized by T0 (this can be checked\nby moving to the crystalline context; see (LBP) of 2.2.3 3)). As the set S(\u03b1) of characters\nof T0W (F) through which T0W (F) acts on L\u03b1 \u2297Zp W (F) is uniquely determined by \u03b1 and\nwe have S(\u03b1) \u2229 S(\u03b11 ) = \u2205, if \u03b1 6= \u03b11 , we get that we have a direct sum decomposition\nLie(GN ) \u2297Zp W (F) = \u2295\u03b1\u2208S L\u03b1 \u2297Zp W (F); from this (ESTDSD) follows.\nDeclaring Ls = {0} if s \u2208 [\u22122, 2] \\ S, we have a natural inclusion\n[L\u03b1 , L\u03b2 ] \u2282 L\u03b1+\u03b2\nof \u0393k -modules, where \u03b1 and \u03b2 belong to S. If k = k\u0304, then L0 is the maximal Zp -submodule\nof Lie(GN ) on which \u0393k acts trivially. From the functorial aspect of Fontaine's comparison\ntheory we get that we have a natural identification\n(ZERO)\n\nL0 = Lie(P=0 )\n\nWe assume now that GN is a reductive group (1.15.1 points out implicitly that this is\nalways so). Using the same arguments, we get that we have an \u00e9tale slope type direct sum\ndecomposition of Lie(Gad\nN ). Moreover, we have a logical variant of (TOR) and (ZERO)\n\u2032\nin the adjoint context. To argue this last thing, we consider the Zariski closure P=0\nin\n1\nGN of the reductive subgroup of GNQp having L0 [ p ] as its Lie algebra. It is a reductive\nsubgroup of GN , as it contains the maximal torus T0 of GN and as its generic fibre is.\nFrom Fontaine's comparison theory we get that we have a natural identification of the\n\u2032\n\u2032\nand of P=0 ; under this identification, Zp -valued points of P=0\nare\ngeneric fibres of P=0\nmapped into Zp -valued points of P=0 . From [Ti2, 3.4.1] we get that in fact we have an\n\u2032\nidentification of P=0\nwith P=0 . This implies that we have a natural identification of the\n\u2032\nextension to W (k) of the image P\u0303=0 of P=0\nin Gad\nN and the image of P0W (k) in G. From\nthis the adjoint variants of (TOR) and (ZERO) follow.\n3.11.8.1.1. Remark. If p \u2265 5, then 3.11.8.1 holds in the general context of\nShimura-canonical lifts of Shimura-ordinary (adjoint) Lie \u03c3-crystals, cf. 2.2.16.5.\n3.11.9. The cyclic diagonalizable context. Most of the decompositions of 3.11.2\nC and 3.11.8 make sense, under proper formulation, in a cyclic diagonalizable context.\n341\n\n\fThe same applies in connection to 3.11.2 B and to Auti of 3.11.7, with i \u2208 {0, 1}. To list\nthe two differences showing up, let C = (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G, (t\u03b1)\u03b1\u2208J ) be a cyclic diagonalizable\nShimura filtered \u03c3-crystal. We do have a slope sign direct sum decomposition for C as in\n3.11.2 C but its summands are p-divisible objects of MF[\u22121,1](W (k)). 3.11.8.1 (ZERO)\nholds iff the Shimura filtered Lie \u03c3-crystal attached to C is of toric type.\n\u0001\n3.12. Shimura F -crystals and generic points. Let M, F 1 , \u03c6, G, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J be a\n \u0303 be a Shimura filtered F Shimura filtered \u03c3-crystal over k. Let CH := (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G, H, f)\ncrystal with H a smooth, locally closed subscheme of G through which the origin factors\nand such that the W (k)-morphism H \u2192 G/P is smooth in a open neighborhood of this\nfactorization; here P is the parabolic subgroup of G normalizing F 1 . With the notations\nof 2.2.10, let \u03b7 : Spec(k\u03b7 ) \u2192 Spec(R) be a geometric point sitting over the generic point\nof the special fibre of Spec(R). Let\n\u0001\nC\u03b7 := M \u2297W (k) W (k\u03b7 ), \u03c6\u03b7 , GW (k\u03b7 )\n \u0303 by pull back through \u03b7 (cf.\nbe the Shimura \u03c3k\u03b7 -crystal obtained from (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G, H, f)\nFact 3 of 2.2.10).\n3.12.1. Theorem. C\u03b7 is a GW (k\u03b7 ) -ordinary \u03c3k\u03b7 -crystal.\nProof: There is a Shimura filtered F -crystal CG := (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G, f \u03031 ) with the property that Shimura F -crystals obtained from it by pull back through geometric points\nover the generic point of the special fibre of the scheme over which CG is defined are\nG-ordinary (cf. 3.1.0 d)).\nLet l := dd((M, \u03c6, G)) (see 2.2.22 4)). We consider a Shimura filtered F -crystal C1\nover the special fibre of Spec(R1 ), where R1 := W (k)[[x1 , ..., xl]], which is a universal\ndeformation of (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ) (see 2.2.21 UP). CH and CG are both induced\nfrom C1 through (uniquely determined; see 2.2.21 UP) W (k)-homomorphisms R1 \u2192 R\nand respectively R1 \u2192 RG compatible with the W (k)-epimorphisms R1 \u0589 W (k), etc.,\ndefining the origins; as the natural W (k)-morphism H \u2192 G/P is smooth around the\norigin and as the natural W (k)-morphism G \u2192 G/P is smooth, we get (to be compared\nwith [Va2, 5.4.4-8]) that these two W (k)-homomorphisms have left inverses and so are\nformally smooth. From this the Theorem follows.\n3.13. Deviations of Shimura (filtered) (Lie) \u03c3-crystals. In this section we\nexpress our hopes for obtaining a reasonable theory of good \"G-pseudo-canonical lifts\" of\nShimura \u03c3-crystals (M, \u03c6, G) which are not potentially cyclic diagonalizable. We mostly\nrestrict to present some definitions, to restate some of the previous results and problems\nin terms of them, to formulate some expectations and to list some of the most interesting\nproblems arising. However, see section 3.13.7: it is dedicated to a study of truncations\nmodulo positive integral powers of p of objects of MF (W (k\u0304)); though we mostly deal\nwith (the classification of) truncations mod p in a context related to Shimura (Lie) \u03c3crystals, the general context of such truncations mod p is as well mentioned (see 3.13.7.8)\nand moreover some paragraphs refer to things modulo positive integral powers of p.\n342\n\n\fLet C0 := (M, \u03c6, G) be a Shimura \u03c3-crystal over k. Let F be the set of direct\nsummands F 1 of M such that the quadruple (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G) is a Shimura filtered \u03c3-crystal.\nF is the G(W (k))-conjugacy class of an arbitrary F 1 \u2208 F (cf. Fact 2 of 2.2.9 3)). To\nfix the notations we choose (arbitrarily) an element F 1 \u2208 F . We get a Shimura filtered\n\u03c3-crystal C := (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G). As usual, let F 0 (Lie(G)) be the parabolic Lie subalgebra\nof Lie(G) formed by elements taking F 1 into itself.\nWe assume F has more than 1 element; so G is not a torus (cf. 3.2.2). Let p be\nthe parabolic Lie subalgebra of sl(M ) corresponding to non-negative slopes of (sl(M ), \u03c6).\nLet\npG := Lie(Gder ) \u2229 p.\nLet \u03c0 be a projector of gl(M [ p1 ]) on Lie(GB(k) ) fixed by \u03c6 and G. For instance we can\ntake \u03c0 such that its kernel is the B(k)-vector subspace of gl(M [ p1 ]) perpendicular on\nLie(GB(k) ) w.r.t. the trace form on gl(M [ p1 ]) (see [Va2, 4.2] and the reference to it of\nAE.0). In what follows, except (perhaps) the undetailed second part of 3.13.3 3) below,\nit is irrelevant which such projector \u03c0 we choose. Let\np0G := p \u2229 ker(\u03c0).\nThe B(k)-vector spaces p0G [ p1 ] and pG [ p1 ] are normalized by \u03c6.\n3.13.1. Definitions and notations. 1) By the deviation of C we mean the rational\nnumber\n\u0001\ndim pG \u2229 F 0 (Lie(G))\n.\nd(C) :=\ndimW (k) (pG )\n2) By the complementary deviation of C we mean the rational number\n\u0001\ndim p0G \u2229 F 0 (sl(M ))\n.\nd (C) :=\ndimW (k) (p0G )\n\u22a5\n\n3) By the global deviation of C we mean the rational number\n\u0001\ndim p \u2229 F 0 (sl(M ))\ngd(C) :=\n.\ndimW (k) (p)\n4) By the deviation of C0 we mean the rational number d(C0 ) defined as the maximum\nof all numbers d(C), with the F 1 -filtration F 1 of M running through the set F .\n5) By the complementary (resp. global) deviation of C0 we mean the rational number\nd\u22a5 (C0 ) (resp. gd(C0 )) defined as the maximum of all rational numbers d\u22a5 (C) (resp.\ngd(C)), with the F 1 -filtration F 1 of M running as in 4).\n6) By a G-pseudo-canonical lift of C0 we mean a Shimura filtered \u03c3-crystal C\u0303 =\n(M, F01 , \u03c6, G) such that d(C0 ) = d(C\u0303).\n343\n\n\f7) By the CM -deviation of C0 , we mean the number CM \u2212 d(C0 ) \u2208 N \u222a \u221e, defined\nas follows: if there is a finite, flat DVR extension V of W (k\u0304) such that there is a maximal\nQp -torus of GB(k\u0304) whose Lie algebra is formed by elements of Lie(GB(k\u0304) ) fixed by \u03c6 \u2297 1\nand whose extension to V [ p1 ] is a torus of the generic fibre of a parabolic subgroup of\nGV lifting the parabolic subgroup of Gk\u0304 normalizing F 1 \u2297W (k) k\u0304, then CM \u2212 d(C0 ) is\nthe smallest possible value of [V : W (k\u0304)] for such a V ; if such a V does not exist, then\nCM \u2212 d(C0 ) = \u221e.\n3.13.2. Remarks. 1) C0 is a G-ordinary \u03c3-crystal iff d(C0 ) = 1, cf. 3.1.0 a). C\nis a G-canonical lift iff d(C) = 1, cf. 3.1.0 a) and b). This motivates our terminology:\ndeviations of Shimura (filtered) \u03c3-crystals. So we view the numbers introduced in 3.13.1\n1) to 5) as a measure of how far or close a Shimura \u03c3-crystal (M, \u03c6, G) (resp. a Shimura\nfiltered \u03c3-crystal (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G)) is from being a G-ordinary \u03c3-crystal (resp. a G-canonical\nlift).\n2) A G-pseudo-canonical lift is not necessarily unique. This can be seen looking at\n\u03c3-crystals associated to supersingular abelian varieties over k.\n3) The CM -deviations are measuring how far a Shimura \u03c3-crystal is from being\npotentially cyclic diagonalizable: the CM -deviation of a Shimura \u03c3k\u0304 -crystal is 1 iff it has\na lift of quasi CM type (cf. 2.2.18).\n3.13.3. Variants. 1) 3.13.1 has been stated using non-negative slopes. The same\nthing can be stated using positive, negative or non-positive slopes. In such a case, as well\nas in others (to be defined below), we use a left upper index of the form +, \u2212, or 0\u2212 for\nthe deviations introduced, to emphasize that they have been defined using respectively\npositive, negative or non-positive slopes. For instance we get rational numbers + d(C),\npn \u2212 0\u2212 d(C), etc.\n2) In some cases it is useful to define deviations of higher order. By this we mean\nthat in 3.13.1 1) to 5) we replace F 0 (Lie(Gder )) or F 0 (sl(M )) with their iterates under\nthe action of \u03c6; for instance, we replace F 0 (sl(M )) by\n1\nsl(M ) \u2229 \u03c6i (F 0 (sl(M [ ]))),\np\ni \u2208 N \u222a {0}. So we obtain sequences of deviation numbers di (C), d\u22a5\ni (C), gdi (C), di (C0 ),\n\u22a5\ndi (C0 ), gdi (C0 ), i \u2208 N \u222a {0}, which for i = 0 become the numbers introduced in 3.13.1.\n2') Replacing in 2) \u03c6i (F 0 (sl(M [ p1 ]))) by\n1\n\u2229in=0 \u03c6n (F 0 (sl(M [ ]))),\np\nwe obtain \u2229 (intersection) type deviations of higher order. The notations to be used:\nd\u2229i (C), d\u22a5\n\u2229i (C0 ), etc.\nIn connection to 2) and 2'), we always drop the lower right index i = 0.\n344\n\n\f3) Definitions 3.13.1 1) to 6) make sense for Shimura (filtered) isocrystals over k. Of\ncourse, for a Shimura isocrystal (M 1 , \u03c61 , G1 ) we need to choose a set F 1 of \"admissible\"\nfiltrations of M 1 ; often F 1 is a G1 (B(k))-conjugacy class of a fixed filtration.\nSometimes, for the sake of refinement, we also work with pn -deviations of Shimura\n(filtered) \u03c3-crystals, n \u2208 N. Not to make the story too long, here we just define the\npn -deviation of C, n \u2208 N. It is the rational number defined by:\n\u0001\nlength pG \u2297W (k) Wn (k) \u2229 F 0 (Lie(G) \u2297W (k) Wn (k))\n\u0001\np \u2212 d(C) :=\n.\nlength pG \u2297W (k) Wn (k)\nn\n\nHere length(\u2217) is the usual length of a finitely generated module \u2217 over the artinian local\nring Wn (k).\n4) All deviations introduced above which are not of global or complementary type,\nmake sense for Shimura (filtered) Lie \u03c3-crystals.\n5) We can define isogeny deviations. They are denoted by putting isog\u2212 in front\nof the notation of the involved deviation. For instance, by the isogeny deviation of C0 ,\ndenoted isog \u2212 d(C0 ), we mean the greatest number d(Ci0 ), with Ci0 running through the\nrepresentatives of Isog(C0 ). For isog \u2212CM \u2212(C0 ), the word \"greatest\" has to be replaced\nby the word \"smallest\".\n6) We can define strong CM -deviations, denoted by replacing CM by SCM , by\nreplacing (in 3.13.1 7)) the expression \"there is a maximal\" by: \"for any maximal\".\n3.13.3.1. Remarks 1). C0 is a G-ordinary \u03c3-crystal iff p \u2212 d(C0 ) = 1. C is a\nG-canonical lift iff pn \u2212 d(C) = 1, \u2200n \u2208 N. These two facts are a consequence of the proof\nof 3.4.8 (cf. also 3.1.0 a)).\n2) We can introduce also the numbers\n\u0001\nlength pG \u2297W (k) Wn (k) \u2229 F 0 (Lie(Gder ) \u2297W (k) Wn (k))\n\u0001\np \u2212 df (C) :=\n.\nlength F 0 (Lie(Gder )) \u2297W (k) Wn (k)\nn\n\nBut these numbers can be greater or smaller than the ones attached to a G-canonical lift.\nUsing this, we can easily construct examples for which these numbers for G-canonical\nlifts do not characterize them.\n3) In 1995 we conjectured:\nConjecture. All isog \u2212 SCM -deviations of Shimura (Lie) \u03c3-crystals are finite\nnumbers.\nThis conjecture is very much related to Langlands\u2013Rapoport's conjecture referred\nto in 1.15.9 and so it will play a central role in \u00a714.\n4) We do believe that the above deviations allow a relatively uniform treatment of\nall Shimura (adjoint) (filtered) (Lie) \u03c3-crystals, regardless of the fact they are or are not\npotentially cyclic diagonalizable.\n345\n\n\f3.13.4. Problems. Many problems (questions) are arising. We mention just few\nof them.\n1) When G-pseudo-canonical lifts can be defined as well in terms of d\u22a5 (\u2217) or of gd(\u2217)\nnumbers?\n2) Fixing C0 , can we determine all possible values of the numbers d(C), d\u22a5 (C), gd(C),\nwhere the filtration F 1 of M runs as in 3.13.1 4)?\n3) Determine all Shimura \u03c3-crystals C0 for which we can define uniquely up to\nisomorphisms a G-pseudo-canonical lift of them, by using the numbers introduced in\n3.13.3 2) and 3).\n4) How are pn -deviations (n \u2208 N) related to deviations?\n5) How deviations (pn -deviations, CM -deviations, etc.) vary when we replace \u03c6 by\ng\u03c6 with g \u2208 G(W (k))? What are their possible values?\n6) What is the connection between CM -deviations and deviations?\n7) Let A be an abelian variety over a number field E. For any unramified prime v\nof E of good reduction for A, we can define a CM -deviation CM DA (v) and a SCM deviation SCM DA (v) (of the \u03c3k(v) -crystal of the reduction of A w.r.t. v). How are they\nvarying in terms of v? Is it true that all these CM -deviations are 1, except for a finite\nnumber? See 4.6.2.3 2) for a similar question in the relative context.\n8) How are the CM -deviations and the SCM -deviations related?\n3.13.5. Wintenberger groups and deviations. We consider the canonical split\ncocharacter \u03bc(F 1 ) : Gm \u2192 GL(M ) of the filtered \u03c3-crystal (M, F 1 , \u03c6). Due to its\nfunctoriality, it factors through G. The Zariski closure in G of the smallest subgroup of\nGB(k) whose Lie algebra is normalized by \u03c6 and contains the Lie algebra of \u03bc(F 1 )(Gm ), is\ncalled (in honor of [Wi, 4.2.3]) the Wintenberger group of (M, F 1 , \u03c6); it does not depend\non G and so is denoted by W (M, F 1 , \u03c6). From the proof of 2.2.18 we get:\nFact. W (M, F 1 , \u03c6) is a torus of G iff (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G) is potentially cyclic diagonalizable.\nLet W1 be the subgroup of G generated by \u03bc(F 1 ), with F 1 running as in 3.13.1 4).\nLet W2 be the Zariski closure in G of the smallest (so connected) subgroup of GB(k) with\nthe property that its Lie algebra is stable under \u03c6 and contains Lie(W1 ). Let Wi+2 be\nthe Zariski closure in GL(M ) of the centralizer of the generic fibre of Wi in GL(M [ p1 ]),\ni = 1, 2. We call Wi as the i-th Wintenberger group of C0 , i = 1, 4.\nExercise. If (M, \u03c6) is an ordinary \u03c3-crystal, show that W1 is the extension of Gm\nby a smooth, commutative, unipotent group of relative dimension equal to dd(C0 ). Hint:\nuse 3.6.18.2.\n3.13.5.1. Versal endomorphisms of C0 . Let (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J be a family of tensors of\nT (M [ p1 ]) such that (C, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ) is a Shimura filtered \u03c3-crystal with an emphasized family\nof tensors. Let D be a Shimura p-divisible group over W (k) whose associated p-divisible\nobject with tensors of MF[0,1](W (k)) is (C, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ). We consider an endomorphism\n346\n\n\fh : M \u2192 M fixed by \u03c6. We say h is a versal endomorphism of C0 if any one of the\nfollowing equivalent conditions is satisfied:\ni) h normalizes any element of F ;\nii) h is fixed by W1 ;\niii) h is fixed by W2 ;\niv) h defines naturally an endomorphism of the p-divisible group DG underlying the\nuniversal Shimura p-divisible defined (see 2.2.21) by D (over the formal power series ring\nin dd(C0 ) variables with coefficients in W (k)).\nThe use of iv) is part of the third place where we need p \u2265 3. Similarly we speak\nabout versal automorphisms h : (M, \u03c6)\u2192(M,\n \u0303\n\u03c6) of C0 ; in this case the above equivalent\nconditions are also equivalent to:\nv) h \u2208 W3 (W (k));\nvi) h \u2208 W4 (W (k)).\nWarning: a versal automorphism is not necessarily an automorphism in the sense of\n2.2.9 6).\n3.13.5.2. Comments. We do not know when Wi is a smooth group over W (k), or\nwhen the special fibre of Wi is a connected group, or when the generic fibre of W3 or of\nW4 is a connected group. We do not know how to compute the relative dimension wi of\nWi or how to determine the structure of the generic fibre of Wi . We do not know when\nwi is an isogeny invariant.\n3.13.5.3. W-deviations. Let g \u2208 G(W (k)) be such that (M, g\u03c6, G) is a G-ordinary\n\u03c3-crystal. We define wi (G \u2212 ord) \u2208 N as the relative dimension of the i-th Wintenberger\ngroup of the extension of (M, g\u03c6, G) to k\u0304. The number\nwdi (C0 ) :=\n\nwi\n\u2208 (0, \u221e) \u2229 Q\nwi (G \u2212 ord)\n\nis called the i-th W-deviation or the i-th Wintenberger deviation of C0 ; it is well defined,\ncf. 3.11.1 c). Warning: wdi (C0 ) is not always 1, as it can be checked using supersingular\n\u03c3-crystals. Some of the questions and problems of 3.13.2-4 can be adapted to the context\nof W-deviations.\n3.13.5.4. Relative rigidity. Let G1 be a reductive subgroup of GL(M ) containing\nG and such that the triple (M, \u03c6, G1 ) is a Shimura \u03c3-crystal. We say C0 is rigid w.r.t.\nG1 , if for any versal automorphism of C0 defined by an element h \u2208 G1 (W (k)) we have:\nh centralizes Lie(Gder ). When G1 = GL(M ) we drop the words \"w.r.t. G1 \".\nExercise. We assume that dimW (k) (M ) = 8, that G contains the group of scalar\nautomorphisms of M and that G is a split GL2 -group whose representation on M is a\ndirect sum of 4 copies of the standard 2 dimensional irreducible representation of G. If\ndd(C0 ) = 1 (i.e. if it is non-zero) and if all slopes of (M, \u03c6) are 0 or 1, then C0 is rigid.\n347\n\n\fHint: use the fact that any endomorphism of M fixed by a Borel subgroup of G is fixed\nby G itself.\n3.13.6. Three other types of deviations. By the isomorphism deviation isom \u2212\nd(C0 ) of C0 we mean the isomorphism deviation of its extension to k\u0304 (cf. 3.6.16 2)). By\nthe Newton polygon deviation (resp. Newton polygon Lie deviation) of C0 , we mean the\nsmallest number N P \u2212d(C0 ) \u2208 N (resp. N P L \u2212d(C0 ) \u2208 N) such that (M, g\u03c6) and (M, \u03c6)\n(resp. such that (Lie(G), g\u03c6) and (Lie(G), \u03c6)) have the same Newton polygon, provided\ng \u2208 G(W (k)) is congruent to the identity mod pNP \u2212d(C0 ) (resp. mod pNP L\u2212d(C0 ) ). We\nhave isom \u2212 d(C0 ) \u2265 N P \u2212 d(C0 ) and isom \u2212 d(C0 ) \u2265 N P L \u2212 d(C0 ).\nIf N P \u2212 d(C0 ) = 1 (resp. if N P L \u2212 d(C0 ) = 1) we say C0 is an N P -canonical (resp.\nN P -Lie-canonical) Shimura \u03c3-crystal. If isom \u2212 d(C0 ) = 1, then we say C0 is an isomcanonical Shimura \u03c3-crystal. Similarly we define isom-deviations of Shimura adjoint Lie\n\u03c3-crystals and isom-canonical Shimura adjoint Lie \u03c3-crystals.\nExamples. Any Shimura-ordinary \u03c3-crystal is N P -canonical and N P -Lie-canonical,\ncf. 3.9.3 (and 3.1.0 a) and c)); even more: it is also an isom-canonical Shimura \u03c3-crystal,\ncf. 3.11.1 c). If dimW (k) (M ) = 2, then C0 is automatically N P -canonical, N P -Liecanonical and isom-canonical Shimura \u03c3-crystal.\nProblem. Study how the isomorphism and Newton polygon (Lie) deviations are\nrelated to the other deviations introduced in 3.13.1-5.\n3.13.6.1. NP variation functions. We assume n1 := N P \u2212 d(C0 ) > 1 (resp.\nn2 := N P L\u2212d(C0 ) > 1). For n \u2208 S(1, n1 \u22121) (resp. n \u2208 S(1, n2 \u22121)), we denote by f1 (n)\n(resp. f2 (n)) the number of (distinct) Newton polygons of the Shimura (resp. Shimura\nLie) \u03c3-crystals of the form (M, g\u03c6) (resp. of the form (Lie(G), g\u03c6)), with g \u2208 G(W (k))\ncongruent to the identity mod pn . We refer to f1 (resp. f2 ) as the first (resp. the second)\nNP variation function attached to (or of) C0 .\n3.13.7. CM levels. Let n \u2208 N. Till end of 3.13.7-9 we assume k = k\u0304. We now\nassume C0 is not cyclic diagonalizable. We say C0 is of CM level at least n if there is a\nlift of it F 1 \u2208 F such that C is cyclic diagonalizable of level n (in the sense of 2.2.22 1)).\nWe denote by\nn(C0 ) \u2208 N \u222a {0, \u221e}\nthe smallest supremum of the set of those n such that C0 is of CM level at least n. We\nrefer to n(C0 ) as the CM level of C0 . End of 2.2.22 1) points out that using emphasized\nfamilies of tensors we get the same CM levels.\nIf k 6= k\u0304 and C0 is not potentially cyclic diagonalizable, we define the CM level n(C0 )\nof C0 to be the CM level of its extension to k\u0304.\nComments. 1) It seems to us possible to formulate extremely challenging variants\nof 3.13.4 7), involving CM levels instead of CM -deviations.\n2) We assume that k = k\u0304 and that C0 is not cyclic diagonalizable. As the Weyl group\nof G is finite, we deduce the existence of a finite number of isomorphism classes of cyclic\n348\n\n\fdiagonalizable Shimura filtered \u03c3-crystals of the form (M, F 1 , g\u03c6, T ), with g \u2208 G(W (k))\nand with T a maximal torus of G. So, from this and from 3.6.16 2) we get:\nCorollary. There is M \u2208 N \u222a {0}, such that n((M, g\u03c6, G)) \u2264 M , for any g \u2208\nG(W (k)) with the property that (M, g\u03c6, G) is not cyclic diagonalizable.\nThe smallest such number M is called the maximal CM level of Cl(C0 ).\n3) From the Corollary of 2.2.22 1) and from 2.2.13.3 we get that we can speak as\nwell about CM levels of Shimura adjoint Lie \u03c3-crystals.\n3.13.7.1. Expectation (the CM level one property). Always n(C0 ) \u2208 N.\nAn approach towards its proof. One needs to show n(C0 ) 6= 0. Let T , B and\n\u03c61 have the same significance as in 3.2.3. So we can write \u03c6 = g\u03c61 , with g \u2208 G(W (k))\n(with the notations of 3.2.3, g := (g1 g0 )\u22121 ). Let\nad\n\u03c8\u03041 : Lie(Gad\nk ) \u2192 Lie(Gk )\n\nbe the Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Hasse\u2013Witt adjoint map of (M, \u03c61 , G). Let P + be the parabolic\nsubgroup of G having F 0 (g) as its Lie algebra and let P \u2212 be its opposite w.r.t. T . Let\nN + (resp. N \u2212 ) be the unipotent radical of P + (resp. of P \u2212 ). P 0 := P + \u2229 P \u2212 is a Levi\nsubgroup of both P + and P \u2212 .\nWe consider the Zp -structure GZp of G defined as in 3.11.2 B for (M, F 1 , \u03c61 , G). So\nfor a smooth subscheme H of G (resp. of Gk ), \u03c3(H) is the smooth subscheme of G (resp.\nof Gk ) obtained from H by applying \u03c3 to elements of H(W (k)) (resp. of H(k)). We have\n\u03c3(T ) = T . Similarly we use \u03c3 in the adjoint context. As in 3.5.2, elements of G(W (k))\n(resp. of G(k)) normalizing T (resp. Tk ) are called Weyl elements. B is invariant under\n\u03c3, cf. 3.11.1 D.\nIn connection to the Expectation, only the value \u1e21 \u2208 G(k) of g mod p is important:\nthe reduction mod p of (M, F 1 , g\u03c61 , G) depends only on \u1e21 and on \"the choice\" of F 1\nmod p2 . Changing \u03c6 : M \u2192 M by another \u03c3-linear endomorphism h\u03c6h\u22121 : M \u2192 M\nisomorphic to it, with h \u2208 G(W (k)) which mod p normalizes F 1 /pF 1 , g gets replaced by\nhg\u03c61 h\u22121 \u03c6\u22121\n1 . As we are interested only in \u1e21, we can assume\nh = h1 h3 h2 ,\nwith h1 \u2208 N + (W (k)), with h2 \u2208 P 0 (W (k)), and with h3 \u2208 N \u2212 (W (k)) congruent to the\nidentity mod p. As \u03c61 = \u03c3\u03bc( p1 ), with \u03bc : Gm \u2192 G as the canonical split of (M, \u03c61 , G)\n(cf. 3.11.2 B), \u1e21 gets replaced by the reduction mod p of hg\u03c61 h\u22121 \u03c6\u22121\n1 which is:\n(\u2217)\n\n\u22121\nm1 m2 \u1e21\u03c3(m\u22121\n2 )\u03c3(m3 );\n\nhere m1 \u2208 N + (k) and m2 \u2208 P 0 (k) are the reduction mod p of h1 and respectively of h2 ,\nwhile m3 \u2208 N \u2212 (k) is uniquely determined by h3 ; when h3 vary, m3 varies through all\nk-valued points of N \u2212 .\n349\n\n\fWe consider the k-variety\nH := Nk+ \u00d7k Pk0 \u00d7k Nk\u2212 ,\nand endow it with a new group structure by the following rule: if (m1 , m2 , m3 ),\n(r1 , r2 , r3 ) \u2208 H(k) then\n\u22121\n(m1 , m2 , m3 )(r1 , r2 , r3 ) := (m1 m2 r1 m\u22121\n2 , m2 r2 , m3 m2 r3 m2 ) \u2208 H(k).\n\nThis new group structure is different from the product one; however, the group structures\ninduced on Nk+ \u00d7k Nk\u2212 and on Pk0 (embedded naturally in H) are the same as the initial\nones.

We have another action T1 of\nPk00 on X : T1h (x) is defined by the element h\u1e21. We have:\n3.13.7.1.1. Corollary. a) The orbits of T are in one-to-one correspondence to\ninner 1J -isomorphism classes of reduction mod p of Shimura \u03c3-crystals of the form\n(M, g\u03c6, G, (t\u03b1)\u03b1\u2208J ), with g \u2208 G(W (k)).\nb) The orbits of T0 are in one-to-one correspondence to inner isomorphism classes\nof Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Hasse\u2013Witt adjoint maps of the form h\u03c8\u03041 , with h \u2208 Gad\nk (k) (here\n\"inner\" refers to the fact that the isomorphisms are as well defined by elements of Gad\nk (k)).\nProof: a) is a consequence of 2.2.14.0. For b), as the homomorphism G(k) \u2192 Gad (k)\nis surjective and due to (*), we just need to remark that:\ni) for m3 \u2208 G(k) we have m3 \u03c8\u03041 = \u03c8\u03041 iff m3 \u2208 \u03c3(Nk\u2212 )(k): one implication is trivial,\nas \u03c3(N \u2212 ) is a commutative, unipotent group, while the other one is the content of a) of\nStep 2 (it can be read out at any time) of 3.13.7.3 below;\n350\n\n\fii) Pk+0 is the subgroup of Gad\nk normalizing the kernel of h\u03c8\u03041 (as any parabolic\nsubgroup of Gk is its own normalizer); so, as g \u03c8\u03041 and h\u03c8\u03041 have the same kernel Lie(Pk+0 ),\nany inner isomorphism between them is defined by an element of P +0 (k) (i.e. of P + (k));\niii) for any m\u0304 \u2208 P +0 (k) and every h \u2208 Gad (k), m\u0304h\u03c8\u03041 m\u0304\u22121 is the Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013\nHasse\u2013Witt adjoint map of the Shimura \u03c3-crystal (M, m\u0303h\u0303\u03c61 m\u0303\u22121 , G), where m\u0303 (resp. h\u0303)\nis an element of G(W (k)) whose reduction mod p lifts m\u0304 (resp. h).\n3.13.7.1.1.1.

Moreover, the\ndistinct orbits of T0 are in one-to-one correspondence to the elements of WP + \\ WG .\n3.13.7.2. The connection between the orbits of T and T0 . The orbits of T are\nin one-to-one correspondence to the ones of T0 iff \u2200\u1e21 \u2208 G(k) and \u2200z \u2208 Z(Gk ), we have\nz\u1e21 \u2208 o(\u1e21). This is automatically so if the homomorphism h(Z(Gk )) : Z(Gk ) \u2192 Z(Gk )\nthat takes z \u2208 Z(Gk )(k) into z\u03c3(z \u22121 ) is an epimorphism; for instance, this is so if Z(Gk ) is\na torus. 3.13.7.1 (or 3.13.7.1.3 or 3.13.7.1.4) once checked, implies that this always holds,\nregardless of how h(Z(Gk )) is: this is a consequence of 3.11.1 c) applied to Shimura\nfiltered \u03c3-crystals of the form (M, F 1 , g\u03c6, T ), with g \u2208 G(W (k)). More precisely, from\n3.11.1 c) we get:\nFact. The pull back under the natural epimorphism Gk \u0589 X of the orbit of T0\ndefined by a Weyl element w \u2208 G(k) is the orbit of T defined by w.\n351\n\n\f3.13.7.3. Groups of automorphisms of Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Hasse\u2013Witt adjoint maps. We use the notations of 3.13.7.1, though below we take a slightly different\napproach. What follows is a digression in three Steps on such groups of automorphisms.\nStep 1. A reduction to Weyl's elements. Let Q := \u03c3(Pk\u2212 ). Let w0 \u2208 G(k)\nbe a Weyl element such that w0 Qw0\u22121 \u2229 Pk+ contains Bk . Using Bruhat decomposition\n(see [Bo2, 14.12]), we get that \u1e21w0\u22121 = p\u0304w1 w0 q\u0304w0\u22121 , with p\u0304 \u2208 P + (k), with w1 \u2208 G(k) a\nWeyl element and with q\u0304 \u2208 Q(k). So \u1e21 = p\u0304wq\u0304, with w := w1 w0 a Weyl element. Let\np\u0303 \u2208 P + (W (k)) lifting p\u0304. Replacing (M, g\u03c61 , G) by the Shimura \u03c3-crystal (M, p\u0303\u22121 g\u03c61 p\u0303, G)\nisomorphic to it, we can assume that the Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Hasse\u2013Witt adjoint map of\n(M, \u03c6, G), has the same image as w\u03c8\u03041 . This represents a quicker (but less useful) proof\nof 3.5.3 (2).\nStep 2. A lemma. The notations of the following general Lemma, are entirely\nindependent of all previous notations.\nLemma. Let k1 be an arbitrary field. Let H be an absolutely simple, adjoint group\nover k1 . Let P be a parabolic subgroup of H. We consider the subgroup C (resp. PC ) of\nH centralizing (resp. normalizing) the Lie algebra n of the unipotent radical N of P . We\nhave:\na) If the characteristic of k1 is not 2, then PC = P . If moreover N is a commutative\ngroup, then C = N ;\nb) If the characteristic of k1 is 2, then PC red = P . If moreover N is a commutative\ngroup, then Cred = C \u2229 P = N ;\nc) The kernel of the adjoint map Ad : H \u2192 GL(Lie(H)) is trivial (i.e. the center of\nLie(H) is trivial).\nProof: We can assume the characteristic of k1 is positive; we denote it by p. We can\nassume k1 = k1 . The part c) is a well known result; for instance, it is a consequence of\n[Va2, 3.1.2.1 c)], applied to a lift of H to an adjoint group H\u0303 over W (k) (the characteristic\n0 case of c) is trivial). The existence of such a lift is a consequence of the uniqueness\ntheorem of [SGA3, Vol. III, p. 313-4] and of the existence \u2013for instance, see [Hu1, 25.5]\nor [SGA3, Vol. III, Exp. XXV]\u2013 of Chevalley group schemes over Z.\nPC contains P and so PC red is a parabolic subgroup of H. Let T be a maximal torus\nof P . Let N \u2212 be the unipotent radical of the opposite of P w.r.t. T . As T normalizes\nn we have: T normalizes PC and so it normalizes Lie(PC ). We now assume p \u2265 3. To\nshow that P = PC , we just need to show that Lie(PC ) = Lie(P ). If this is not so, then\nwe deduce the existence of a non-zero element x \u2208 Lie(PC ) \u2229 Lie(Ga (x)), with Ga (x) as\na Ga subgroup of N \u2212 normalized by T ; so [x, n] \u2282 n. Applying 3.5.4 a) to [x, y], with y\na non-zero element of the Lie algebra of the Ga subgroup of N which is opposite (w.r.t.\nT ) to Ga (x), we reach a contradiction.\nIf p = 2 and PC red is not P , then from the structure of parabolic subgroups of H\ncontaining P (see [Bo2, 14.17-18]), we deduce that there is a P SL2 or an SL2 -subgroup\nof PC red normalizing the Lie algebra of the unipotent radical of a Borel subgroup of it.\nContradiction (there are no non-trivial 1 dimensional representations of such a group).\n352\n\n\fWe assume now N is a commutative group; so C contains N . It is enough to show\nthat the reductive group P/N acts faithfully on n. As the characteristic 0 case is trivial,\nusing again [Va2, 3.1.2.1 c)] in the context of the natural (inner) representation of P\u0303 /\u00d1\non Lie(\u00d1 ), with P\u0303 as a lift of P to a parabolic subgroup of H\u0303 and with \u00d1 as its unipotent\nradical, the Lemma follows.\nExercise. Using c) and standard noetherian arguments show that at the end of\n2.2.13 the assumption R = W (k) is not needed.\nStep 3. Some computations. We have:\nFact. a) \u2200h \u2208 Gad (k), hw\u03c8\u03041 has the same image as w\u03c8\u03041 iff h \u2208 wQw\u22121 (k).\nb) A Weyl element w1 \u2208 G(k) is such that w1 \u03c8\u03041 is inner isomorphic to hw\u03c8\u03041\nfor some h \u2208 wQw\u22121 (k) iff the intersection P + (k)w1 \u2229 wQ(k) is non-empty, i.e. iff\nw1 \u2208 P + (k)wQ(k)\nc) The actions T and T0 split up in terms of double cosets of G(k) of the form\n+\nP (k)wQ(k).\nd) Up to inner isomorphism, the image of g \u03c8\u03041 depends only on the double coset\nP + (k)gQ(k).\nProof: a) is a consequence of a) of Step 2 (the use of a) of Step 2 is the seventh\nplace where we need p > 2). Based on this, b), c) and d) follow from 3.13.7.1.1 ii).\nBased on a) and on Step 1) we can assume the Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Hasse\u2013Witt adjoint\nmap of (M, \u03c6, G) is hw\u03c8\u03041 , with h \u2208 wQw\u22121 (k). c) implies: for the study of T and of\nT0 , we always need to fix some element of DC := P + (k) \\ G(k)/Q(k); we presently work\nwith the one defined by w \u2208 G(k).\n+\nLet Q0 be the image of Q in Gad\nk . In what follows we identify Nk with the unipotent\n\u2212\n+0\nad\nradical of Pk ; similarly we identify Nk with a subgroup of Gk . Let N 0 := \u03c3(Nk\u2212 ) is\nthe unipotent radical of Q0 . The quotient variety\n\nS := wQ0 w\u22121 /wN 0 w\u22121 ,\nis the moduli variety of maps hw\u03c8\u03041 , with h \u2208 wQw\u22121 (k) (cf. a) and c) of Step 2).\nWe consider the subgroup\nM0 := Pk+0 \u2229 wQ0 w\u22121\nof Gad\nk . It is known (see [SGA3, Vol. III, 4.1.1-2 of Exp. XXVI]), that M0 is a smooth,\nconnected k-group; it contains the image Tadk of T in Gad\nk . For any m \u2208 M0 (k),\n\u22121\n0 \u22121\nmw\u03c8\u03041 m\nis of the form hm w\u03c8\u03041 , with hm \u2208 wQ w (k), and so it defines a unique\nelement of S(k). Let Z be the subgroup (warning: it is not necessarily reduced) of M0\nacting trivially on w\u03c8\u03041 via inner conjugation. We get a well defined orbit morphism\nmorb : M0 /Z \u2192 S,\n353\n\n\fwhich is an embedding. We still denote by morb the morphism M0 \u2192 S defining it. Let\ns0 \u2208 S(k) be defined by h being identity.\nIn what follows, when we want to disregard the Lie algebra structure of the tangent\nspace of the origin of a smooth group H\u0303 over k, we denote it by T0 (H\u0303). Similarly, we\ndenote by Ts0 (S1 ) the tangent space at s0 of any subscheme S1 of S containing s0 .\nLet M1 (resp. M2 ) be the intersection of wQ0 w\u22121 with Nk+ (resp. with L0 := Pk00 ).\nM1 is a normal subgroup of M0 and M0 is the semidirect product of M1 and M2 (this is\na consequence of the fact that w is a Weyl element and of the fact that M0 is connected).\nSo M1 and M2 are as well smooth, connected. Any m0 \u2208 M0 (k) can be written uniquely\nas a product m0 = m1 m2 , with mi \u2208 Mi (k), i = 1, 2. From the part of 3.5.3 referring to\nba (or from 3.13.7.1 (*)), we get that\n\u22121\n\u22121\nm0 w\u03c8\u03041 m\u22121\nw\u03c8\u03041 .\n0 = m1 m2 w\u03c3(m1 )w\n\nFor m\u0303 \u2208 Gad (k), let\n\ns(m\u0303) := w\u03c3(m\u0303)w\u22121 .\n\nSo the map associating hm0 to m0 = m1 m2 is given by: the pair (m1 , m2 ) is mapped into\n(F OR)\n\nm1 m2 s(m2 )\u22121 .\n\nMoreover, s(L0 ) is a Levi subgroup of wQ0 w\u22121 ; here and in what follows we apply the\nsame conventions pertaining to \u03c3, to the homomorphism s : Gk \u2192 Gk .\nWe can identify Ts0 (S) with T0 (s(L0 )). As the tangent map in the origin of the\nFrobenius map \u03c3 is trivial, under this identification we have\n(1)\nLet\n\nT0 (Z) = T0 (Pk+0 \u2229 s(Nk\u2212 )).\nZ1 := Nk+ \u2229 s(Nk\u2212 ).\n\nIt is a connected, smooth normal subgroup of M0 , contained in M1 and in Z. M1 /Z1\ncan be identified with M3 := Nk+ \u2229 s(L0 ); M3 is a smooth, connected group. The\nconnectedness part of Z1 and M3 is implied by the fact that M1 is the semidirect product\nof M3 and of Z1 . Similarly we get that M4 := L0 \u2229 s(Nk\u2212 ) is connected and smooth and\ncan be identified with a normal subgroup of M0 /Z1 . If y \u2208 M4 (k) belongs as well to\nZred /Z1 (k), then ys(y)\u22121 belongs to s(Nk\u2212 )(k); so s(y) \u2208 s(Nk\u2212 )(k). So y is trivial. We\nget that we have a natural homomorphism\nqZ : Zred /Z1 \u2192 M5 := M0 /Z1 M4\nwhose kernel is finite and has no k-valued points besides the identity. qZ is purely\ninseparable, cf. (1). The study of Z can be pushed forward, using formally closed\nmorphisms Spec(k[[T ]]) \u2192 Zred /Z1 (to be compared with [MFK, ch. 2]). This will not\n354\n\n\fbe done here (see \u00a79-10 for details). Here we just mention the case when the image of qZ\nhas dimension 0. In such a case dimk (Z) = dimk (Z1 ) and so M0 /Z has dimension equal\nto the sum\ndimk (M4 ) + dimk (Pk+0 \u2229 s(L0 )).\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nk (s(L )\u2229L )\nBut both dimk (M4 ) and dimk (s(L0 ) \u2229 Nk\u2212 ) are equal to dimk (L )\u2212dim\n. We\n2\n0\nconclude: M0 /Z has the same dimension as L and so the same dimension as S =\nwQ0 w\u22121 /wN 0 w\u22121 . So morb is an open embedding.\n\nExample. We assume L0 \u2229 s(Nk\u2212 ) is trivial. Then Z is smooth and Z1 is the\nconnected component of the origin of Z. So the image of qZ has dimension 0 and so morb\nis an open embedding.\n3.13.7.3.1. Standard inequalities. From the existence of morb we get\ndimk (Q0 ) \u2212 dimk (N 0 ) \u2265 dimk (M0 ) \u2212 dimk (Z).\nAs dimk (L0 \u2229 s(Pk+ )) = dimk (L0 \u2229 s(Pk\u2212 )), we get\n(2)\n\ndimk (S) = dimk (L0 ) = dimk (M2 ) + dimk (M4 ).\n\nAlso from Step 3 of 3.13.7.3 (see def. of Z1 and (1) of it) we get\n(3) dd((M, \u03c6, G)) = dimk (Nk\u2212 ) \u2265 dimk (Pk+0 \u2229s(Nk\u2212 )) \u2265 dimk (Z) \u2265 dimk (Nk+ \u2229s(Nk\u2212 )).\n3.13.7.4. Complements. A. We come back to 3.13.7.1. It is easy to see that all\nstabilizers of points of X w.r.t. T1 are smooth. Moreover, the tangent spaces of the orbit\nmaps of T1 and T0 are the same (as the differential of the Frobenius map \u03c3 is the zero\nmap). We conclude:\nFact. \u2200x \u2208 X , its orbit under T0 has dimension greater or equal to the dimension\nof its orbit under T1 .\nLemma. Let X be a k-variety (not necessarily connected) which has two stratifications S1 and S0 into locally closed, regular, connected subvarieties. We assume that the\nnumber n(S1 ) of strata of S1 is finite and that \u2200x \u2208 X(k) the dimension of the stratum\nof S0 to which x belongs is greater or equal to the similarly defined stratum of S1 . Then\nthe number of strata of S0 is as well finite.\nWe leave it to the reader to prove this Lemma using noetherian induction on n(S1 ).\nBut the orbits of T1 are in general not finite. So the above Fact and Lemma are not\nenough to conclude that T0 has a finite number of orbits. However, 3.3.4, 3.6.6.1 1) and\n3.11.1 c) imply:\nCorollary. T (and so also T0 ) has a dense open orbit.\nB. The elimination and the insertion processes. Let Gi , i \u2208 I, be the simply\nfactors of Gad\nk . As usual (see 3.4.3.1 and the proof of 3.6.6; see also c) of Step 3) we can\n355\n\n\fassume they are permuted transitively by \u03c3. So we can assume that I0 := I = S(1, n)\nand that \u03c3 takes Gi into Gi+1 , with n + 1 = 1. Let I1 be as in 3.4.3.4 (i.e. I1 is the subset\n+0\n1\nof I0 corresponding to simple factors of Gad\nk not included in Pk ). We can assume I\nis non-empty (otherwise 3.13.7.1.4 follows from Lang's theorem and so 3.13.7.1.3 follows\nfrom 3.13.7.2). We also assume I0 6= I1 (otherwise what follows is void). We order the\nelements of I1 as\na1 < a2 < ... < a|I1 | .\nWe can assume a1 = 1. For each i \u2208 I1 , let\nni := ai+1 \u2212 ai ,\nwith a|I1 |+1 := n + a1 , and let Nk\u2212i := Nk\u2212 \u2229 Gi . Let\nXnc := Nk+ \\\n\nY\n\nGi /\n\ni\u2208I1\n\nY\n\n\u03c3 ni (Nk\u2212i ).\n\ni\u2208I1\n\nLet\nPk00 (I1 ) := Pk00 \u2229 (\n\nY\n\nGi ).\n\ni\u2208I1\n\nWe have an action T0nc of Pk00 (I1 ) on Xnc by the rule: for h \u2208 Pk00 (I1 ) \u2229Gi (k) and x \u2208 Xnc\ndefined by an element gi \u2208 Gi (k), T0nc h (x) is defined by the element\nhgi \u03c3 ni (h\u22121 ).\nSimilarly to T1 we define\nT1nc : Pk00 (I1 ) \u00d7 Xnc \u2192 Xnc\nusing left translations. It is trivial to see that:\nFact. The orbits of T0 (resp. of T1 ) are in one-to-one correspondence with the orbits\nof\n(resp. of T1nc ). In Q\nparticular, each orbit of T0 is defined by a k-valued point of X\ndefined by an element of i\u2208I1 Gi (k).\nT0nc\n\nIn other words the Gi 's factors defined by i \u2208 I0 \\ I1 can be \"eliminated\".\n\nWe have a reversed process of \"inserting\" non-compact factors. For each i \u2208 I0 \\ I1 ,\nlet j \u2208 I1 beQthe greatest\nwhich is smaller than i. We define the following\nQ element Q\nsubgroups of i\u2208I0 Gi = i\u2208I1 Gi \u00d7 i\u2208I0 \\I1 Gi :\nNk+i := \u03c3 j\u2212i (Nk+ \u2229 Gj ),\nNk\u2212i := \u03c3 j\u2212i (Nk\u2212j ),\nPk00 (i) := \u03c3 j\u2212i (Pk00 (I1 ) \u2229 Gj ),\n356\n\n\fY\n\nNk+ (I0 ) := Nk+ \u00d7\n\nNk+i ,\n\ni\u2208I0 \\I1\n\nY\n\nPk00 (I0 ) := Pk00 (I1 ) \u00d7\n\nPk00 (i).\n\ni\u2208I0 \\I1\n\nLet\n\nXI0 := Nk+ (I0 ) \\\n\nY\n\nGi /\u03c3(Nk\u2212 (I0 )),\n\ni\u2208I0\n\nwhere\n\nNk\u2212 (I0 ) := Nk\u2212 \u00d7\n\nY\n\nNk\u2212i\n\ni\u2208I0 \\I1\n\nQ\nis the opposite of Nk+ (I0 ) w.r.t. the action of the image Tk (I0 ) of Tk in i\u2208I0 Gi via inner\nconjugation. We have a natural action T0 (I0 ) of Pk00 (I0 ) on XI0 : it is entirely defined in\nthe same manner as T0 . We have a natural embedding\niX : Xnc \u0592\u2192 XI0\ndefined by the natural inclusion of\n\nQ\n\ni\u2208I1\n\nGi into\n\nQ\n\ni\u2208I0\n\nGi and a monomorphism\n\niI0 : Pk00 (I1 ) \u0592\u2192 Pk00 (I0 )\nwhich takes hi \u2208 (Pk00 (I1 ) \u2229 Gi )(k) into\nnY\ni \u22121\n\n\u03c3 l (hi ).\n\nl=0\n\nThe pair (iI0 , iX ) is compatible with the two actions T0nc and T0 (I0 ), i.e. we have\niX (T0nc h (x)) = T0 (I0 )iI0 (h) (iX (x)),\nwith x \u2208 Xnc (k) and h \u2208 Pk00 (I1 )(k).\nExercise. a) Two k-valued points of Xnc belong to the same orbit under T0 (I0 ) iff\nthey belong to the same orbit under T0nc (and so the number of orbits of T0nc is finite if\nthe number of orbits of T0 (I0 ) is finite).\nb) If a k-valued point of Xnc belongsQto the orbit under T0 (I0 ) of a k-valued point of\nXI0 defined by some Weyl element w \u2208 i\u2208I0 Gi (k) normalizing Tk (I0 ), then it belongs\nQ\nto the orbit under T0nc of some Weyl element w\u0303 \u2208 i\u2208I1 Gi (k) normalizing Tk (I0 ).\n\nHints: a) (resp. b)) boils down to the fact that there is no element of Pk00 (i)(k)\nbelonging to Nk+i (k)Nk\u2212i (k) (resp. the only Weyl elements normalizing Tk (I0 ) and belonging to Nk+i (k)Pk00 (i)(k)Nk\u2212i (k) are those belonging to Pk00 (i)(k)). So for b) one needs\nto use the classical Bruhat decomposition in the form: Gi (k) is a disjoint union of sets of\n357\n\n\fthe form Nk+i (k)Pk00 (i)(k)Nk\u2212i (k)w, with w a Weyl element of Gi (k) normalizing Tk (I0 ).\nHere i \u2208 I0 \\ I1 .\nThe moral of this Exercise is (cf. also the Fact): if 3.6.13.7.1.4 holds in the context\nof T0 (I0 ) then it also holds in the context of T0 . So to check that 3.6.13.7.1.3 holds in\nthe abstract context of Shimura adjoint Lie \u03c3-crystals, we can essentially restrict to the\ncontext of totally non-compact (see 3.10.5) cyclic factors. Here \"essentially\" refers\nto the\nQ\nfact that we still need to check that the maximal number of Weyl elements of i\u2208I1 Gi (k)\nnormalizing Tk (I0 ) and defining elements of Xnc belonging to distinct orbits of T0nc is as\nexpected (in practice this is very easy).\nC. We come back to 3.13.7.1. We recall that we are interested only on g mod p.\nUsing the classical Bruhat's decomposition (over k; see [Bo2, 14.12]), we can assume\ng = b1 wb2 , with b1 , b2 \u2208 B(W (k)) and with w a Weyl element. Changing g\u03c61 by\n\u2032\n\u2032\nb\u22121\n1 g\u03c61 b1 and using the fact (see 3.3.1) that \u03c61 b1 = b1 \u03c61 , with b1 \u2208 B(W (k)), we can\nassume g = wb, with b \u2208 B(W (k)). We can assume b is a product of elements of distinct\nGa subgroups of B normalized by T . It is known that there is an arbitrary choice of the\norder in which such a product is taken (cf. [SGA3, Vol. III, 4.1.2 of p. 172]). So one can\ntry to apply (increasing) induction on the number of factors of such a product which are\nnot identity: one can easily check that many of such factors can be assumed to be trivial.\nThis approach is very practical, if one has to deal with a specific (concrete) situation.\nD. Remarks. 1) From 3.13.7.1.1 a) and the classification of principally quasipolarized finite, flat, commutative group schemes over k annihilated by p and liftable to\nW (k) (for instance, see [EO] and [Oo3]) we get that 3.13.7.1 holds if G = GSp(M, \u03c8M ),\nwith \u03c8M : M \u2297W (k) M \u2192 W (k)(1) a principal quasi-polarization of (M, \u03c6). So 3.13.7.1.34 hold provided Gad is a product of simple groups left invariant by \u03c3 and of some Cn Lie\ntype.\n2) One can construct group actions similar to the ones T and T0 of 3.13.7.1.1, by\nworking modulo pm , with m \u2208 N (i.e. by considering truncations mod pm of Shimura\n\u03c3-crystals and of Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Hasse\u2013Witt shifts). Moreover, 3.13.7.2 has analogues\nfor m \u2265 2 (and this motivates 3.9.8). See \u00a79-10 for details. One can use the language of\nstacks as well but we think the language of orbit maps (like T0 's) is much more natural\nand practical.\n3) The Bruhat type decompositions hinted at in 3.13.7.1.3-4 can be formulated for\nmany other general contexts. We do expect that all of them can be proved formally, by\nusing a \u03c3-language in the context (see [Bou2, ch. IV, \u00a72]) of Tits' systems. We now state\na more general form of 3.13.7.1.3 in the context of reductive groups.\nLet H be an an arbitrary reductive group over an algebraically closed field k of\ncharacteristic p. Let F : H \u2192 H be an epimorphism fixing only a finite number of\nelements (for instance, cf. [Hu2, \u00a78]). Let PH be an arbitrary parabolic subgroup of H\n+\nand let NH\nbe its unipotent radical. We assume the existence of a maximal torus TH of\n\u2212\n0\nbe\nPH taken by F into itself. Let PH\nbe the Levi subgroup of PH containing TH . Let NH\n+\nthe opposite of NH\nw.r.t. the action of TH (via inner conjugation) on Lie(H). Warning:\nwe not need to assume the existence of a Borel subgroup of PH taken by F into itself.\n358\n\n\fExpectation (the Bruhat decomposition in the F -context for reductive\ngroups). Any element g \u2208 H(k) can be written down as a product\ng = n+ p0 wF (p\u22121\n0 )F (n\u2212 ),\n\u2212\n+\n0\n(k), p0 \u2208 PH\n(k), n\u2212 \u2208 NH\n(k) and with w \u2208 H(k) normalizing TH .\nwith n+ \u2208 NH\nMoreover the minimal number of such w's needed is precisely the number of elements of\nthe quotient set WPH \\ WH , where WH is the Weyl group of H normalizing TH and WPH\nis its subgroup formed by elements leaving PH invariant.\n\nBehind this Expectation and its adjoint variant, there are group actions TH and T0H\nas in 3.13.7.1.1. Not to repeat the things, here we just mention that T0H is the action of\n\u2212\n+\n00\n0\nthe image PH\n) which is obtained by passing to\nof PH\n\\ H ad /F (NH\nin H ad on XH := NH\n00\n00\nquotients from the action of PH\non H ad defined by: p00 \u2208 PH\n(k) takes g \u2208 H ad (k) into\nad\np00 gF ad (p\u22121\nis the epimorphism of H ad naturally defined by F . See 3.13.7.8\n00 ). Here F\nfor TH in the \u03c3-context.\n3.13.7.5. Example. We assume that all simple factors of Gad are of A1 Lie type.\nWe refer to 3.13.7.4 B, with I = I0 . As we are dealing with the A1 Lie type, Pk00 (I1 ) is\njust a maximal torus of\nY\nG(I1 ) :=\nGi .\ni\u2208I1\n\nSo the subgroup B + (resp. B \u2212 ) of G(I1 ) generated by Nk+ (resp. by Nk\u2212 ) and by\nPk00 (I1 ) is a Borel subgroup of G(I1 ). The classical Bruhat decomposition (applied as in\nthe beginning of Step 1 of 3.13.7.3) tells us that G(I1 )(k) is a disjoint union of double\ncosets B + (k)wB \u2212 (k) = B + (k)wNk\u2212 (k), with w running through (representatives of)\nelements of the Weyl group of G(I\nPk00 (I1 ). As the A1 Lie type does not\nQ1 ) normalizing\n\u2212\n\u2212\nallow involutions, we have Nk = i\u2208I1 \u03c3 ni (Nk \u2229 Gi ).\nSo to check 3.13.7.1.4 in the present context we just need to show (cf. the elimination\n00\nw\u2208\nprocess of 3.13.7.4 B) that each element of the form tw, with t \u2208\nQPk (I1\u0001)(k)\nQand with\n00\nni \u22121\nG(I1 )(k) normalizing Pk (I1 ), can be written as a product\nt\nw\n\u03c3\n(t\ni ),\ni\u2208I1 i\ni\u2208I1\n00\nwhere ti \u2208 (Gi \u2229 Pk (I1 ))(k). Restatement: t can be written as\n\u0010Y \u0011 \u0010Y\n\u0011\n(F T )\nti w\n)\nw\u22121 .\n\u03c3 ni (t\u22121\ni\ni\u2208I1\n\ni\u2208I1\n\nBut this is a consequence of [Hu2, th. of 18.3], applied to the epimorphism of Pk00 (I1 )\nthat takes t\u0303i \u2208 (Gi \u2229Pk00 (I1 ))(k) into w\u03c3 ni (t\u0303i )w\u22121 . We can also use systems of equations,\nclose in spirit to the ones of first type, to get this restatement: identifying Pk00 (I0 ) with\na finite product of Gm 's groups, the actual type of systems of equations we get over k is\nns\n\nxs = cs xp\u03c0(s) ,\nwhere s belongs to some set having as many element as the dimension of Pk00 (I1 ), with\n\u03c0 a permutation of it, with all ns 's belonging to Z \\ {0} and with all cs 's as non-zero\n359\n\n\felements of k; obviously it has a solution formed by non-zero elements of k. Moreover,\nthe map that takes t into the element of (FT) is separable.\nFrom this last paragraph and 3.13.7.2 we conclude:\nCorollary 1. The Expectations of 3.13.7.1 and 3.13.7.1.3-4 hold for the A1 Lie\ntype. Moreover, all stabilizers of T0 are smooth.\nSimilarly, we get (based on loc. cit. and not on arguments involving systems of\nequations) that the Expectation of 3) of 3.13.7.4 D holds for the A1 Lie type. More\ngenerally, the same arguments give us:\nCorollary 2 (the essentially Borel subgroup case). The Expectation of 3) of\n3.13.7.4 D holds for the case when the image of PH in each simple factor SF of H ad is\neither a Borel subgroup of SF or is SF itself. Moreover, all stabilizers of T0H are smooth.\nMoreover, in the context of T0 and T1 for the A1 Lie type, the Lemma of 3.13.7.4 A\ndoes apply (i.e. we do get based on it that T0 has a finite number of orbits).\n3.13.7.6. A variant of the elimination process. Let I be as in 3.13.7.4 B. We\ndo not assume any more I = I0 . Let J be the subset of I formed by elements i such that\nGi is not included in the image of P + in Gad\nk . Let \u03c0 be the permutation of I defined\nnaturally by \u03c3; so \u03c3(Gi ) = G\u03c0(i) . Based on the Fact and a) of 3.13.7.4 B, we can assume\nall components of g in Gi , with I \\ J, are identity elements. Instead of \u03c8\u03041 and g \u03c8\u03041 we\ncan work equally well with their non-compact variants \u03c8\u03041nc and g \u03c8\u03041nc . Here\n\u03c8\u03041nc : \u2295i\u2208J Lie(Gi ) \u2192 \u2295i\u2208J Lie(Gi )\ntakes an element xi \u2208 Lie(Gi ), with i \u2208 J, into \u03c8\u03041ni (xi ), where ni \u2208 N is the smallest\nelement such that \u03c0 ni (i) \u2208 J. We refer to g \u03c8\u03041nc as the non-compact Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013\nHasse\u2013Witt adjoint map of (M, g\u03c61 , G) or of its attached Shimura Lie \u03c3-crystal; accordingly the other terminology of 3.9 pertaining to types of Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Hasse\u2013Witt\nmaps extend to such a non-compact context. By an Q\ninner automorphism of g \u03c8\u0304 nc , we\nmean an automorphism of it defined by an element of i\u2208J Gi (k). Let\niJ (p) :\n\nY\n\nGi \u0592\u2192\n\ni\u2208J\n\nY\n\nGi\n\ni\u2208I\n\nbe the monomorphism defined as follows: for gi \u2208 Gi (k), with i \u2208 J,\nij (gi ) :=\n\nnY\ni \u22121\n\n\u03c3 l (gi )\n\nl=0\n\n(to be compared with iI0 of 3.13.7.4 B). Based on c) of Step 2 of 3.13.7.3 we get:\nFact. The image under iJ (p) of the group of inner automorphisms of g \u03c8\u03041nc is the\ngroup of inner automorphisms of g \u03c8\u03041 . In particular, these two groups of inner automorphisms have the same dimension.\n360\n\n\fSo we can perform the elimination process not only in connection to finding the\norbits of T0 but also in connection to finding groups of inner automorphisms of Faltings\u2013\nShimura\u2013Hasse\u2013Witt adjoint maps (over k). From this Fact and Corollary 1 of 3.13.7.5\nwe get:\n3.13.7.6.0. Corollary. We assume Gi is of A1 Lie type, \u2200i \u2208 I. Then Q\nthe number\n0\n|J|\nof orbits of T is 2 : each such orbit o(w)\nw \u2208 i\u2208J Gi (k)\nQ is defined by a Weyl element\nQ\nnormalizing the image T (J)k of Tk in i\u2208J Gi ; moreover, if w1 \u2208 i\u2208J Gi (k) is another\nWeyl element, we have o(w) = o(w1 ) iff w1 = tw2 for some t \u2208 T (J)k (k). So each such\norbit o(w) defines a function\nfw : J \u2192 {0, 1}\nby the rule: f (i) = 0 iff the component of w in Gi does belong to T (J)k (k).\nQ\nIf B + (resp. B \u2212 ) is the image of P + (resp. of P \u2212 ) in i\u2208J Gi , then under the\nQ\nprojection of Gad\nk on\ni\u2208J Gi , o(w) is mapped onto\nB + (k)wB \u2212 (k).\n\nThe group of automorphisms of w\u03c8\u03041nc (and so of w\u03c8\u03041 ) has dimension equal to\nX\n\nfw (i).\n\ni\u2208J\n\nMoreover o(w) specializes to o(w1 ) iff\n(SP EC)\n\nfw1 (i) \u2265 fw (i), \u2200i \u2208 J.\n\nProof: The only thing left to be remarked is that the dimension dw of the group of\ninner automorphisms of w\u03c8\u03041nc is nothing else but\n(DIM )\n\ndimk (B + ) \u2212 dimk (B + wB \u2212 /B \u2212 ).\n\nThe argument\ngoes as follows. In order to have g \u03c8\u03041nc g \u22121 of the form h\u03c8\u03041nc (here g,\nQ\n+\nh \u2208\ni\u2208J Gi (k)), we need g \u2208 B (k), cf. the normalizing part of a) of Step 2 of\n3.13.7.3 (see also Step 3 of 3.13.7.3). Moreover, h\u03c8\u03041nc = \u03c8\u03041nc iff h is a k-valued point\nof the unipotent radical of B \u2212 (k), cf. the centralizing part of a) of Step 2 of 3.13.7.3;\nso the variety parameterizing maps of the form h\u03c8\u03041nc , with (see c) of Step 3 of 3.13.7.3)\nh \u2208 B + (k)wB \u2212 (k), has the same dimension as (in fact it is isomorphic to) B + wB \u2212 /B \u2212 .\nSo dimk (B + ) \u2212 dw = dimk (B + wB \u2212 /B \u2212 ). This ends the proof.\n3.13.7.6.1. The non-compact context. The whole of 3.13.7.3 can be redone in\nthe context of \u03c8\u03041nc . We just need to:\nQ\nQ\n\u2013 replace the role of \u03c3 with the one of the endomorphism F : i\u2208J Gi \u2192 i\u2208J Gi\nthat takes gi \u2208 Gi (k) into \u03c3 ni (gi ), with ni \u2208 N as in 3.13.7.6;\n361\n\n\fQ\n\u2013\nconsider\na\nWeyl\nelement\nw\n\u2208\ni\u2208J Gi (k) normalizing the image Tk (J) of T in\nQ\ni\u2208J Gi ;\nQ\n\u2013 replace s by the endomorphism sJ of\ni\u2208J Gi that takes gi \u2208 Gi (k) into\n\u22121\nwF (gi )w .\nQ\nLet P + (J) (resp. Q(J)) be the image of Pk+ (resp. of F (Pk\u2212 )) in i\u2208J Gi . Let\nP \u2212 (J) be the opposite of P + (J) w.r.t. the action (via inner conjugation) of Tk (J); so\nQ(J) := F (P \u2212 (J)). Let T0nc and Xnc be as in 3.13.7.4 but obtained working with J\ninstead I1 (i.e. Qwe do not assume that we are in a cyclic context). Let P 0 (J) be the\nimage of P 0 in i\u2208J Gi . Let N (J) be the unipotent radical of Q(J). As in c) of the Fact\nof Step 3 of 3.13.7.3, the action T0nc splits in terms of the image in Xnc of double cosets\nof the form P + (J)wQ(J). So for its study we need to fix an element of\nDCnc := P + (J)(k) \\\n\nY\n\nGi (k)/Q(J)(k).\n\ni\u2208J\n\nFor future references, we point out:\nQ\nA. Fact. Let g \u2208 i\u2208J Gi (k). If we are in the cyclic context (i.e. we have I = I0\n|I1 |\nand J = I1 ), then the Lie stable p-rank of g \u03c8\u03041nc is |I\ntimes the Lie stable p-rank of g \u03c8\u03041 .\n0|\nLet\n\nM0nc := P + (J) \u2229 wQ(J)w\u22121 = P + (J) \u2229 sJ (P \u2212 (J))\n\nand let Z nc be its subgroup fixing w\u03c8\u03041nc . Let\nZ1nc := Nk+ \u2229 sJ (Nk\u2212 ).\nIt is a smooth, connected subgroup of Z nc . As in 3.13.7.3.1 we get\n(4)\n\ndd((M, \u03c6, G)) \u2265 dimk (P + (J) \u2229 sJ (Nk\u2212 )) \u2265 dimk (Z nc ) \u2265 dimk (Nk+ \u2229 sJ (Nk\u2212 )),\n\nand\ndimk (Q(J)) \u2212 dimk (N (J)) \u2265 dimk (M0nc ) \u2212 dimk (Z nc ).\n\n(5)\nLet w0 \u2208\n\nQ\n\ni\u2208J\n\nGi (k) be a Weyl element with the property that the intersection\nP + (J) \u2229 w0 Q(J)w0\u22121\n\ncontains the image Bk (J) of B in\nmined. We have:\n\nQ\n\ni\u2208J\n\nGi ; the image of w0 in DCnc is uniquely deter-\n\nB. Claim. If dd((M, \u03c6, G)) = dimk (Z nc ), then w \u2208 P + (J)(k)w0 Q(J)(k).\nProof: From (4) we get sJ (Nk\u2212 ) is a subgroup of P + (J). Based on [Bo2, 14.22 (i)],\nthis is equivalent to: the intersection P + (J) \u2229 sJ (P \u2212 (J)) = P + (J) \u2229 wQ(J)w\u22121 contains\n362\n\n\fQ\na Borel subgroup of i\u2208J Gi . As we are dealing with double cosets, we can assume that\nthis Borel subgroup is Bk (J). The Claim follows.\nC. Theorem. The following two statements are equivalent:\na) Nk+ = sJ (Nk\u2212 );\nb) w \u2208 P + (J)w0 Q(J), the image in Xnc of the double coset P + (J)w0 Q(J) is one\norbit of the action T0nc and we have dd((M, \u03c6, G)) = dimk (Z nc ).\nProof: If Nk+ = sJ (Nk\u2212 ), then P + (J) = sJ (P \u2212 (J)) = wQ(J)w\u22121 ; so P 0 (J) =\nsJ (P 0 (J)) and w \u2208 P + (J)w0 Q(J). We get: P + (J)(k)w0 Q(J)(k) = P + (J)(k)w0 . So the\nimage IM of P + (J)w0 Q(J) in Xnc can be naturally identified with P 0 (J) (cf. the Hint\nof a) of 3.13.7.4 B). Under this identification, the automorphism of IM defined naturally\nby h \u2208 P 0 (J)(k) via the action T0nc , is nothing else but the automorphism of P 0 (J) that\ntakes h1 \u2208 P 0 (J)(k) into\nhh1 sJ (h)\u22121\n(this is the same as (FOR) of Step 3 of 3.13.7.3). So from Lang's theorem in the form\nof [Hu2, th. 8.3] (applied to the homomorphism F = sJ ) we get that IM is one orbit of\nT0nc . The last part of b) is a consequence of (4).\nWe assume now that b) holds. To check a) we can assume w = w0 . Due to the\n\"one orbit part\", in (5) we have equality. As dimk (N (J)) = dd((M, \u03c6, G)), we get\ndimk (M0nc ) = dimk (Q(J)) = dimk (P + (J)). So M0nc = P + (J) and so by reasons of\ndimensions P + (J) = sJ (P \u2212 (J)). So a) holds. This ends the proof.\nD. The double coset P + (J)w0 Q(J) is referred as the final coset and any Shimura\n\u03c3-crystal whose non-compact Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Hasse\u2013Witt map is inner isomorphic to\ngfin \u03c8\u03041nc , with gfin \u2208 P + (J)w0 Q(J) is referred as a quasi-final Shimura \u03c3-crystal. Similarly,\nwe speak about Shimura adjoint Lie \u03c3-crystals which are quasi-final.\n3.13.7.6.2. The list. The equality Nk+ = sJ (Nk\u2212 ) is equivalent to the fact that\neach cyclic adjoint factor C of (M, \u03c61 , G) is of one of the following types:\na) Bl , Cl or DlR type;\nb) of Al type with l odd and which is also (of constant) type\n\nl+1\n;\n2\n\nc) of Al type whose concentrated \u03b5-type is involutive;\nd) of DlH type with l odd and greater than 4, whose concentrated \u03b5-type is involutive;\ne) of simple DlH type with l even and greater than 3.\nThis list conforms with the expression of w0 's in [Bou2, planche I to IV].\n3.13.7.6.3. The cyclic diagonalizability property. We assume that the two\nstatements of 3.13.7.6.1 C hold. We consider a Weyl element \u03c9 of G(W (k)) whose image\nin Gad\nk is the same as the image of w0 . We get a cyclic diagonalizable Shimura filtered\n\u03c3-crystal (M, F 1 , \u03c9\u03c61 , T ). We have:\nTheorem. (M, \u03c9\u03c61 , G) is an isom-canonical Shimura \u03c3-crystal.\n363\n\n\fCorollary (the cyclic diagonalizability property). Any Shimura \u03c3-crystal\n(M, g\u03c61 , G), with g \u2208 G(W (k)), whose Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Hasse\u2013Witt map is inner isomorphic to the one of (M, \u03c9\u03c61 , G), is isomorphic to (M, \u03c9\u03c61 , G) and so is cyclic diagonalizable.\nProofs: To prove the Theorem, we need to show: if g \u2208 Ker(G(W (k)) \u2192 G(k)),\nthen (M, \u03c9\u03c61 , G) and (M, g\u03c9\u03c61, G) are isomorphic under an isomorphism defined by an\nelement of G(W (k)). We follow the pattern of the proof of 3.6.15 B. By induction on\nm \u2208 N we show that we can assume g \u2208 Ker(G(W (k)) \u2192 G(Wm (k))). It is enough to\nshow that: if g \u2208 Ker(G(W (k)) \u2192 G(Wm (k))), then there is h \u2208 G(W (k)) congruent to\nthe identity mod pm\u22121 and such that the element g\u0303 \u2208 G(W (k)) defined by the equality\ng\u0303\u03c9\u03c61 = hg\u03c9\u03c61 h\u22121 is congruent to the identity mod pm+1 . Let \u03c6\u03031 := \u03c9\u03c61 .\nad\nad\nQ We use the notations of 3.13.7.6 to index the simple factors of G . So 0G =\ni\u2208I GiW (k) , with the special fibre of the simple group GiW (k) being Gi . Let PW (k) (J)\nbe the reductive subgroup of G normalized by T and whose special fibre is the pull\nback to Gk of P 0 (J). Let N + and N \u2212 be as in 3.13.7.1.1. Let P 0 (I) be the smallest\n0\nreductive subgroup of G containing PW\n(k) (J) and stable under the endomorphism i\u03c9 \u25e6 \u03c3\n0\nof G which takes u \u2208 G(W (k)) into \u03c9\u03c3(u)\u03c9 \u22121 . The images of P 0 (I) and of PW\n(k) (J)\nQ\nin i\u2208J GiW (k) are the same (cf. a) of 3.13.7.6.1 C). We choose W (k)-basis B0 , B+\nand B\u2212 of the Lie algebras of P 0 (I), N + and respectively of N \u2212 . Conjugating g \u03c6\u03031 by\nelements\nof G(W (k)) congruent to 1M mod pm and whose images in Gad (W (k)) belong\nQ\nto i\u2208I\\J GiW (k) (W (k)), we can assume\ng = gc g\u2212 g+ g0\n\nwhere g+ \u2208 N + (W (k)), g\u2212 \u2208 N \u2212 (W (k)) and g0 \u2208 P 0 (I)(W (k)) are congruent to the\nidentity mod pm , and where gc \u2208 G(W (k)) is congruent to the identity mod pm+1 . The\norder in which such a product decomposition of g is taken is entirely irrelevant mod p2m\nand so mod pm+1 .\nWe take h of the form h = h3 h2 h1 , where h3 \u2208 G(W (k)) and h1 \u2208 P 0 (I)(W (k)) are\ncongruent to the identity mod pm and where\nh2 = iJ (h+ )iJ (h\u2212 );\nhere\niJ :\n\nY\n\nGiW (k) \u0592\u2192 Gad\n\ni\u2208J\n\nis a monomorphism defined entirely as iJ (p) of 3.13.7.6 and h+ \u2208 N + (W (k)) (resp.\nh\u2212 \u2208 N \u2212 (W (k))) is (warning!) congruent to the identity mod pm\u22121 (resp. mod pm ).\niJ (h+ ) and iJ (h\u2212 ) still make sense as the unipotent subgroups of G are in natural one-toone correspondence to unipotent subgroups of Gad . h1 , g\u2212 and g+ are commuting mod\npm+1 . So we get\n\u22121\n\u22121 \u22121 \u22121\n\u22121 \u22121 \u22121\ng\u0303 = h3 h2 h1 g \u03c6\u03031 h\u22121\n1 \u03c6\u03031 \u03c6\u03031 h2 h3 \u03c6\u03031 = g\u0303c h3 h2 g\u2212 g+ g\u03030 \u03c6\u03031 h2 h3 \u03c6\u03031 ,\n\n364\n\n\fwhere g\u0303c \u2208 G(W (k)) is congruent to the identity mod pm+1 and where\n\u22121\ng\u03030 := h1 g0 \u03c6\u03031 h\u22121\n1 \u03c6\u03031 .\n\nAs P 0 (I) is stable under the endomorphism i\u03c9 \u25e6 \u03c3 of G, Lie(P 0 (I)) is stable under \u03c6\u03031 .\nSo writing 1M \u2212 h1 mod pm+1 as pm times a linear combination of elements of B0 with\ncoefficients in W (k), the condition that g\u03030 is congruent to the identity mod pm+1 gets\ntranslated in choosing the reduction mod p of these coefficients to form a solution of a\nquasi Artin\u2013Schreier system of equations in dimk (P 0 (I)k ) variables with coefficients in k.\nSo based on 3.6.8.1 (with l = 1 and s = 0) we can assume g\u03030 is congruent to the identity\n\u22121\nmod pm+1 . So g\u0303 is of the form g\u0303c h3 g\u0303+\u2212 \u03c6\u03031 h\u22121\n3 \u03c6\u03031 , where\n\u22121\ng\u0303+\u2212 := h2 g\u2212 g+ \u03c6\u03031 h\u22121\n2 \u03c6\u03031 .\n\nWe consider two cases.\nCase 1: m \u2265 2. Every element of G(W (k)) which mod pm is 1M commutes mod\np2m\u22121 with any element of G(W (k)) which mod pm\u22121 is 1M . So g\u0303+\u2212 mod p2m\u22121 (and\nso mod pm+1 ) can be rewritten as g\u0303+ g\u0303\u2212 , where\n\u22121\ng\u0303+ := iJ (h+ )g+ \u03c6\u03031 iJ (h\u22121\n\u2212 )\u03c6\u03031\n\nand\n\n\u22121\ng\u0303\u2212 := iJ (h\u2212 )g\u2212 \u03c6\u03031 iJ (h\u22121\n+ )\u03c6\u03031 .\n\nBased on a) of 3.13.7.6.1 C), we get that g\u0303+ \u2208 N + (W (k)) and g\u0303\u2212 \u2208 N \u2212 (W (k)). We\nwrite 1M \u2212 h\u2212 mod pm+1 as pm times a linear combination C\u2212 of elements of B\u2212 with\ncoefficients in W (k). We write h+ = h1+ h2+ , with h1+ \u2208 N + (W (k)) congruent to the\nidentity mod pm and with h2+ \u2208 N + (W (k)) congruent to the identity mod pm\u22121 . We\n1\nwrite 1M \u2212 h1+ (resp. 1M \u2212 h2+ ) as pm (resp. as pm\u22121 ) times a linear combination C+\n2\n(resp. C+\n) of elements of B+ with coefficients in W (k). The conditions that both g\u0303+ and\ng\u0303\u2212 are congruent to the identity mod pm+1 get translated in choosing the reduction mod\np2 of all these coefficients to form a solution of a system SE of equations with coefficients\nin W2 (k). We split the study of its solutions in two steps. First we consider its subsystem\nSU BSE of equations with coefficients in k in the variables which are the reduction mod\n2\np of all coefficients of C\u2212 and of C+\nand obtained by requiring g\u0303\u2212 to be congruent to\nm+1\nthe identity mod p\nand g\u0303+ to be congruent to the identity mod pm : it is a quasi\nArtin\u2013Schreier system of equations. We can not easily give a formula for the number of\nvariables; this is so due to the fact that the definition of sJ involves iterates of \u03c3 and so\nwe need to appeal to 3.6.8.1.5; if we allow monomials as in the mentioned place, then we\nare dealing with systems of equations (not a priori of first type) which involve precisely\n2 dimk (Nk+ ) variables. Second we pick up a solution of SU BSE and we plug it (via a\nfixed lift h1+ of its truncation mod pm ) in SE. We get a new system of equations with\n1\ncoefficients in k in the variables which are the reduction mod p of all coefficients of C+\nand obtained by requiring g\u0303+ to be congruent to the identity mod pm+1 : it is a quasi\n365\n\n\fArtin\u2013Schreier system of equations. The situation with the number of variables is as\nabove, with 2 dimk (Nk+ ) replaced by dimk (Nk+ ).\nSo we can assume g\u0303+\u2212 is congruent to the identity mod pm+1 . Choosing h3 to be\n1M , we get g\u0303 is congruent to the identity mod pm+1 .\nCase 2: m = 1. This case is a little bit complicated as we can not assume that we\nare dealing with elements which commute mod p2 (see the choice of h+ ). However, based\non 3.5.3 (5)\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u22121\n\u22121\ng+ \u03c6\u03031 iJ (h\u22121\n\u03c6\u03031 iJ (h\u22121\n\u2212 )\u03c6\u03031\n+ )\u03c6\u03031\n\nmod p2 can be rewritten as\n\nand so as\n\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u22121\n\u22121\ng+ \u03c6\u03031 iJ (h\u22121\n\u03c6\u03031 iJ (h\u22121\np+\u22120\n+ )\u03c6\u03031\n\u2212 )\u03c6\u03031\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u03c6\u03031 iJ (h\u22121\n+ )\u03c6\u03031 g+ \u03c6\u03031 iJ (h\u2212 )\u03c6\u03031 p+\u22120 ,\n\nwith p+\u22120 \u2208 P 0 (I)(W (k)) congruent to the identity mod p. So g\u0303+\u2212 mod p2 is congruent\nto\n\u22121\niJ (h+ )EL\u2212 g+ \u03c6\u03031 iJ (h\u22121\n\u2212 )\u03c6\u03031 p+\u22120 ,\nwhere\n\n\u22121\nEL\u2212 := iJ (h\u2212 )g\u2212 \u03c6\u03031 iJ (h\u22121\n+ )\u03c6\u03031 .\n\nSo, writing 1M \u2212h\u2212 (resp. 1M \u2212h+ ) mod p2 (resp. mod p) as p times (resp. as) a linear combination of elements of B\u2212 (resp. of B+ ) with coefficients in W (k), the conditions\n\u22121\nthat EL\u2212 is congruent to the identity mod p2 and iJ (h+ )g+ \u03c6\u03031 iJ (h\u22121\n\u2212 )\u03c6\u03031 is congruent\nto the identity mod p get translated in choosing the reduction mod p of these coefficients\nto form a solution of a quasi Artin\u2013Schreier system of equations with coefficients in k;\nthe situation with the number of variables is as in above part involving SU BSE. So we\n\u2032\n\u2032\ncan assume g\u0303+\u2212 mod p2 is of the form g+\np+\u22120 , where g+\n\u2208 N + (W (k)) is congruent to\nthe identity mod p. Choosing h3 to be the product of an element of P 0 (I)(W (k)) con\u2032 \u22121\ngruent to the identity mod p with (g+\n) , the arguments of the paragraph before Case 1\nreferring to g\u03030 allow us to assume g\u0303+\u2212 (and so g\u0303) is congruent to the identity mod p2 .\nSo regardless of how m is, we can assume g\u0303 is congruent to the identity mod pm+1 .\nThis proves the Theorem. We now refer to the Corollary. We can assume the truncations\nmod p of (M, g\u03c61 , G) and (M, w\u03c61 , G) are inner isomorphic, cf. Fact of 3.13.7.2. So from\nthe construction of T we get: we can assume g is congruent to w mod p. So the Corollary\nfollows from the Theorem. This ends the proofs.\n3.13.7.6.3.1. An approach. We include now an approach to be used to present\nsome examples in 3.15.7 H and K below.\nWe follow the pattern of the proof of 3.13.7.6.3 and we use the previous notations.\nLet w be a Weyl element of the final double coset. We use Weyl's decomposition Lie(G) =\nLie(T ) \u2295\u03b1\u2208\u03a6 g\u03b1 w.r.t. T . So \u03a6 is the set of cocharacters of the action of T on Lie(G)\nand g\u03b1 is the direct summand of Lie(G) on which T acts via \u03b1. Let \u03c6\u03031 := w\u03c61 . \u03c6\u03031\n366\n\n\fpermutes g\u03b1 [ p1 ]'s; so wet a permutation \u03c0 of \u03a6. We concentrate on one cycle (\u03b11 , ...\u03b1s ) of\nit; whatever we do below for it is implicitly done for all other cycles of \u03c0. For i \u2208 S(1, s),\nlet ui \u2208 S(\u22121, 1) be such that \u03b2 \u2208 Gm acts through \u03bc on g\u03b1 as the multiplication with\np\u2212ui .\nAs sJ (Nk\u2212 ) is a subgroup of P + (J), sJ (Nk+ ) is a subgroup of P \u2212 (J). This implies:\nKey property. There is no i \u2208 S(1, s) such that ui and ui+1 are both 1 or both \u22121\n(here us+1 = u1 ).\nWe consider the following modification\nLie \u2212 mod(G) := Lie(T ) \u2295 pLie(N\u2212 ) \u2295 Lie(N + ) \u2295 pL0,\u2212 \u2295 L0,0 \u2295 L0,+\nof Lie(G). Here L0,+ , L0,0 and L0,\u2212 are direct sums of g\u03b1 's subject to the following rules:\n\u2013 their direct sum is Lie(P 0 );\n\u2013 g\u03b1i \u2282 L0+ (resp. g\u03b1i \u2282 L00 ) iff ni = 0 and the first non-zero term of the sequence\n(nj )j\u2265i is 1 (resp. iff (n1 , ..., ns) = (0, ..., 0)).\nWe choose a generator xi of g\u03b1i \u2229 Lie \u2212 mod(G), i \u2208 S(1, s). We obviously have:\nPs\nFact. We assume that there is no cycle (\u03b11 , ..., \u03b1s) of \u03c0 such that i=1 ni \u2265 0 and\n(\u22121, 0, 0, ..., 0, \u22121) = (nj , nj+1 , ..., nl) for some j \u2208 S(1, n) and l \u2208 S(j, j + s \u2212 1). Then\nfor i \u2208 S(1, s), writing \u03c6\u03031 (xi ) = pvi \u03b3i xi+1 , with \u03b3i \u2208 Gm (W (k)) and vi \u2208 S(\u22121, 1), all\nvi , i \u2208 S(1, s), have the same sign, i.e. either all of them are non-negative or all of them\nare non-positive.\n3.13.7.6.3.2. Remark. 3.13.7.6.3 and 3.13.7.6.1 remain true in a principally quasipolarized context (cf. its proof and 3.6.15 B and its proof).\n3.13.7.7. Remark. 3.13.7.1-4, 3.13.7.6 and 3.13.7.6.1 make sense as well in a purely\nLie context involving Shimura adjoint Lie \u03c3-crystals: no modifications of arguments are\nrequired (besides what mentioned in the beginning paragraph of 3.4). So to the list of\n3.13.7.6.2 we can add (again cf. the expression of w0 in [Bou, planche V and VI]) the\nfollowing two extra types:\nf ) of E7 Lie type;\ng) of E6 Lie type whose concentrated \u03b5-type is involutive.\nMoreover, 3.13.7.6.3 can be entirely adapted to Shimura-ordinary p-divisible objects\nover k whose attached Shimura adjoint Lie \u03c3-crystals are such that f) or g) holds for each\none of their cyclic factors.\n3.13.7.8. The case of Fontaine categories p \u2212 MF[a,b] (W (k)). We refer to 3)\nof 3.13.7.4 D. Its Expectation has interpretations similar to the ones of 3.13.7.1 and of\n3.13.7.1.1. In what follows, we exemplify this phenomenon just in the general context\npertaining to Fontaine categories. So we assume H is the extension to k of a reductive\n367\n\n\fgroup HFp over Fp in such a way that F is nothing else but the endomorphism \u03c3 of\nH = Hk .\nLet HZp be a reductive group over Zp whose special fibre is HFp . We consider a\nfaithful representation\n\u03c1 : HZp \u0592\u2192 GL(MZp ),\nwith MZp a free Zp -module of finite rank. We consider a cocharacter \u03bc : Gm \u2192 HW (k)\nsuch that PH lifts to a parabolic subgroup PW (k) of HW (k) in such a way that Lie(PW (k) )\nis the maximal Lie subalgebra of Lie(HW (k) ) on which \u03bc acts (via inner conjugation)\nthrough non-negative, integral powers of the identical character of Gm . [\u03bc] is not uniquely\ndetermined. Its existence can be deduced immediately from the structure of parabolic\nsubgroups of H (see [Bo2, 14.17]): as in the proof of Fact 1 of 2.2.9 3) we can work\njust over k and we can assume \u03bck factors through a maximal torus T of PH ; we need\nthe composite of \u03bck with a specified set CHAR of independent (over Z) characters of\nT to be specified a priori. Here CHAR is a set of characters of T forming a bases of\nthe root system of the action of T on Lie(H), such that any Lie subalgebra of Lie(H)\ncorresponding to an element of CHAR is included in Lie(PH ).\nFor g \u2208 HW (k) (W (k)) we construct a p-divisible object C = (M, (F s (M ))s\u2208S(a,b), \u03c6)\nof MF[a,b] (W (k)), with a, b \u2208 Z, b \u2265 a, as follows. Let M := MZp \u2297Zp W (k) = \u2295bs=a F\u0303 s\nbe the direct sum decomposition defined by \u03bc as in 2.2.1.2. Let F s (M ) := \u2295bj=s F\u0303 j . We\ntake \u03c6 to be g \u25e6 \u03c3 \u25e6 \u03bc( p1 ), where \u03c3 is identified with the \u03c3-linear automorphism of M\nfixing MZp and acting as \u03c3 on W (k). The quadruple\n(M, (F s (M ))s\u2208S(a,b), \u03c6, HW (k) )\nis a p-divisible object with a reductive structure of MF[a,b] (W (k)) (see 2.2.8 3a)). We\nrecall (see 2.2.8 4a) and 2.2.1 d)) that we speak about lifts of (M, \u03c6, HW (k)) and about C\nor some truncations of it being cyclic diagonalizable. As in 3.13.7, provided (M, \u03c6, HW (k))\nhas no lift which is cyclic diagonalizable, we speak about the CM level of (M, \u03c6, HW (k) ).\nWe consider the direct sum decomposition of\nLie(HW (k) ) = \u2295j\u2208S(\u03bc) n(j)\nproduced by \u03bc via inner conjugation; so \u03b2 \u2208 Gm (W (k)) acts through \u03bc on nj as the\nmultiplication with \u03b2 \u2212j . Here S(\u03bc) \u2282 Z is a finite set. Let TW (k) be a maximal torus of\nHW (k) lifting T and through which \u03bc factors. Let N0 be the centralizer of \u03bc in HW (k) . It\nis a reductive subgroup of HW (k) whose Lie subalgebra is n0 . For j \u2208 S(\u03bc) \\ {0}, let Nj\nbe the integral, connected, smooth subscheme of HW (k) which is the product (taken in\nsome order) of the distinct Ga subgroups of HW (k) normalized by TW (k) and whose Lie\nalgebras are included in n(j). For what follows it is irrelevant the order in which such\nproducts are taken, cf. [SGA3, Vol. III, 4.1.2 of p. 172]. The tangent space of Nj in the\norigin of HW (k) is nj . Let N + (resp. N \u2212 ) be the integral, connected, smooth, unipotent\nsubgroup of HW (k) generated by all Nj 's with j > 0 (resp. with j < 0).\n368\n\n\fLet h \u2208 HW (k) (W (k)) be such that (M, (F s (M ))s\u2208S(a,b), h\u03c6h\u22121 , HW (k) ) is still a\np-divisible object with a reductive structure of MF[a,b] (W (k)). From Fact of 2.2.14.2 we\nPs\u2212a\nget that h(F s (M )) \u2282 v=0 pv F s\u2212v (M ), \u2200s \u2208 S(a, b). It is an easy exercise to see that\nthis implies that we can write\nh = h+ h\u2212 h0 ,\nwhere\nh+ =\n\nY\n\nhj\n\nj\u2208S(\u03bc)\u2229(0,\u221e)\n\nand\nh\u2212 =\n\nY\n\nj\u2208S(\u03bc)\u2229(\u2212\u221e,0)\n\nY\n\nhj =\n\n(1M + p\u2212j uj ),\n\nj\u2208S(\u03bc)\u2229(\u2212\u221e,0)\n\nwith hj \u2208 Nj (W (k)) congruent to the identity mod pmax{0,\u2212j} , \u2200j \u2208 S(\u03bc). It is loc.\ncit. (resp. loc. cit. and the fact that, \u2200j1 , j2 \u2208 S(\u03bc) \u2229 (\u2212\u221e, 0), the commutator\n\u22121\nnj1 nj2 n\u22121\nj1 nj2 , with nji \u2208 Nji (W (k)), i = 1, 2, is a W (k)-valued point of the subgroup of\nHW (k) generated by Nj 's with j \u2208 S(\u03bc) \u2229 (\u2212\u221e, j1 + j2 )) which tells us that it is irrelevant\n(for what follows) the order in which the product of h+ (resp. of h\u2212 ) is taken.\nBased on the previous paragraph, as in 3.13.7.1 we get: hg\u03c6h\u22121 \u03c6\u22121 \u2208 HW (k) (W (k))\n\u22121\nmod p is of the same form m1 m2 \u1e21\u03c3(m\u22121\n2 )\u03c3(m3 ) as (*) of 3.13.7.1, \u2200g \u2208 HW (k) (W (k)).\n\u2212\nm1 , \u1e21 and m2 are the reduction mod p of h+ , g and respectively\nQ h0 , while m3 \u2208 N (k)\nis uniquely determined by h\u2212 (it is the reduction mod p of j\u2208S(\u03bc)\u2229(\u2212\u221e,0) (1M + uj )).\nSo we come across entirely the same type of action TH of Nk+ \u00d7k N0k \u00d7k Nk\u2212 on H as T\nof 3.13.7.1. So the Expectation of 3) of 3.13.7.4 D gets interpreted as:\nExpectation (the general form of the CM level one property in the context of Fontaine categories). We assume (M, \u03c6, HW (k)) has no lift which is cyclic\ndiagonalizable. Then its CM level is at least one.\nWe have a variant of this in the adjoint context similar to the one of 3.13.7.1.4:\nwe just have to restate everything in terms of the adjoint representations of HZp and of\nHW (k) . We denote by T0H the group action of N0k on Nk+ \\ Hk /\u03c3(Nk\u2212 ) defined by TH by\npassing to quotient.\nCorollary 2 of 3.13.7.5 provides us with many examples when this Expectation holds;\nin particular it holds if PH is a Borel subgroup of H.\n3.13.7.8.1. Example. Let n \u2208 N. We assume that M has rank n + 1, that\n(a, b) = (0, n), that HW (k) = GL(M ) and that dimW (k) (F s (M )) = n + 1 \u2212 s; so the\nsubgroup PW (k) of GL(M ) normalizing F s (M ), i \u2208 S(1, n), is a Borel subgroup. We say\nC (resp. any one of its truncations) is a flag p-divisible object (resp. a flag object) of\nrank n + 1. As HW (k) = GL(M ), in what follows we do not mention it. We get (cf. end\nof 3.13.7.8):\nCorollary. There is a lift of (M, \u03c6) such that its truncation mod p is cyclic diagonalizable. The number of isomorphism classes of cyclic diagonalizable flag objects\n369\n\n\fannihilated by p and of rank n + 1 is equal to the number of elements of the Weyl group\nof GL(M ) and so it is (n + 1)!.\n3.13.7.8.2. Remark. If PH is as in Corollary 2 of 3.13.7.5, then the whole of\n3.13.7.6.0 can be redone in such a context. Denoting by Hi , i \u2208 J, those simple factors\nof H ad with the property that the image of PH in them is a Borel subgroup, the only\nmodifications needed to be made are:\n0\na) the distinct orbits of TH (or\nQ of TH ) are\nQ in one-to-one correspondence to the\nelements of the Weyl group WJ := i\u2208J Wi of i\u2208J Hi ;\n\n+\n\u2212\nb) denoting by\nQB (i) the image of PH in Hi and by B (i) its opposite w.r.t. the\nimage TJ of T in i\u2208J Hi , \u2200i \u2208 J, the orbit corresponding to w1 \u2208 WJ specializes to\nthe orbit corresponding to another w2 \u2208 WJ if and only if \u2200i \u2208 J, the double coset\n+\n\u2212\nB + (i)w1 (i)B \u2212 (i) specializes\nQ to the double coset B (i)w2 (i)B (i) (here we identify WJ\nwith a set of elements of i\u2208J Hi (k) normalizing TJ , while ws (i) is the component of ws\nin Wi , \u2200s \u2208 {1, 2} and \u2200i \u2208 J);\n\nc) instead of group of automorphisms (of some Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Hasse\u2013Witt maps)\nwe need to speak about stabilizer subgroups of T0H .\n3.13.7.8.3. Example. We assume H is simple, adjoint. If H is of G2 (or F4 or E8\nLie type), then the number of orbits of TH (or of T0H ) is 12 (resp. is 27 32 or 214 35 52 7),\ncf. [Bou2, planche VII to IX].\n3.13.7.8.4. Remarks. 1) 3.13.7.8.3 is included just to \"compensate\" the \"exclusion\" of these Lie types of 2.2.7. It nourishes our hope that using Fontaine categories\none can handle (at least in the context of unramified extensions of Zp ; in fact 2.2.1.4.3\npoints out that even in the context of ramified extensions of Zp there is a lot one can hope\nto do) uniformly all (generic fibres of) reductive groups, from many points of view (like\ninverse \u2013local\u2013 Galois problems, local Langlands's correspondences, etc.). The Shimura\nenvelopes (hinted at in 3.6.20 9)) are (as well) the very first step in this direction.\n2) The whole of 3.13.7.6.1-2 can be redone in the context of 3) of 3.13.7.4: as this\nneeds quite a lot of reformulations, it will not be done here; here we will just mention\nthat in the cyclic context (i.e. when F ad permutes transitively the simple factors of H ad ),\nin order to expect to be in a case similar to the ones listed in 3.13.7.6.2 and 3.13.7.7, we\nneed to assume that all images of PH in a simple factor of H ad which are not reductive,\nup to isomorphisms of such factors, are isomorphic.\n2') Warning: 3.13.7.6.3 can be adapted to the context of 3) of 3.13.7.4 or of 3.13.7.8\nbut often slightly modified; the need of modifications is implied by the fact that in Case\n2 of the proof of 3.13.7.6.3 we did use (cf. its reference to 3.5.3 (5)) that we are in a\ngeneralized Shimura context. So either we try to adapt this Case 2 or we state results\nin the form: some isom-deviations (in the mentioned contexts) are not bigger than some\nnatural numbers.\n3) The Expectation of 3.13.7.8 and 3.13.7.8.1 can be restated in terms of Fontaine\ntruncations mod p (see 2.2.14.2) in a similar way to 3.13.7.1.1.1. This supports 1).\n370\n\n\f4) Once the Expectation of 3.13.7.8 is checked, one can define the a-invariant of\n(M, \u03c6, HW (k)) by: it is the a-invariant of any cyclic diagonalizable p-divisible object\nwith a reductive structure whose Fontaine truncation mod p is isomorphic to the one\nof (M, \u03c6, HW (k)). One checks that this is well defined by performing the proof of M of\n2.2.22 3) mod p.\n3.13.7.9. The general form of Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Hasse\u2013Witt shifts, invariants and maps. With some extra work, we can be more precise in 3.13.7.8.2 c) (or in\nconnection to its variants provided by cases where the Expectation of 3.13.7.8 is checked).\nNot to be too long, we situate ourselves in the filtered adjoint context (i.e. we leave to the\nreader to restate everything as in 3.9.1 or 3.9.4 in the general reductive context, filtered\nor non-filtered, by looking at derived subgroups). So we use the notations of 3.13.7.8 and\nwe assume that H is an adjoint group and that \u03c1 is the adjoint representation. So M is\na Lie algebra over W (k). We still speak about F s (M ), s \u2208 S(a, b) (though in fact we can\ntake a + b = 0). Let Hi , i \u2208 I, be the simple factors of HW (k) . For i \u2208 I, let\nmi \u2208 Z \u2229 (\u2212\u221e, 0]\nbe the smallest number such that Hi \u2229 Nmi is a non-trivial group. Let\n\u03a8 : Lie(HW (k) ) \u2192 Lie(HW (k) )\nbe the \u03c3-linear map that takes xi \u2208 Lie(Hi ) into p\u2212mi \u03c6(xi ). We refer to it as the\nFaltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Hasse\u2013Witt quasi-shift of (M, \u03c6). A great part of 3.13.7.1-8 and of 3.9\ncan be redone for it.\nFirst, let \u03c8\u0304 be its truncation mod p. Second, as in 3.13.7.6 we introduce \u03a8nc and \u03c8\u0304 nc .\nThird, as in 3.9.1 (resp. 3.9.4) we define the Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Hasse\u2013Witt invariant of\n(M, \u03c6) (or of \u03c8\u0304): it is \u2229n\u2208N Im(\u03c8\u0304 n ). Warning: in the present generality, these invariants\nare not so useful; for instance, referring to 3.13.7.8.1, there are (n\u22121)! isomorphism classes\nfor which the Lie stable p-rank is maximal (i.e. equal to 1). Accordingly, the subgroup of\nH whose k-valued points are those g such that g \u03c8\u0304 = \u03c8\u0304, is in general \"too big\" to be used\nas in 3.13.7.3. So we do not think of \u03c8\u0304 as a generalized Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Hasse\u2013Witt\nmap.\nTo us, the right generalization of the Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Hasse\u2013Witt shifts and maps\nof 3.9 is as follows. For s \u2208 Z, let \u03c6s := p\u2212s \u03c6. Let i \u2208 I. We denote by\n\u03a8i,mi : Lie(Hi ) \u2192 Lie(H)\nthe restriction of \u03a8 to Lie(Hi ). If mi < 0, then for any j \u2208 S(mi \u2212 1, \u22121) such that\nHi \u2229 Nj is not (resp. is) the origin of Hi , let\n\u03a8i,j : F j (Lie(Hi )) \u2192 Lie(\u03c3(Hi ))\nbe the restriction of \u03c6j to F j (Lie(Hi )) (resp. be the trivial map). The sequence of maps\n(SEQ)\n\n(\u03a8i,j )i\u2208I, j\u2208S(mi ,max{mi ,\u22121})\n371\n\n\f(resp. the sequence (\u03c8\u0304i,j )i\u2208I, j\u2208S(mi ,max{mi ,\u22121}) formed by their truncation mod p) is referred as the Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Hasse\u2013Witt shift (resp. map) of (M, (F s (M ))s\u2208S(a,b), \u03c6)\n(resp. of (M, \u03c6)). If (M, \u03c6) is a Shimura adjoint Lie \u03c3-crystal, then for each i \u2208 I only\none map \u03a8i,ji is defined; so we can view (SEQ) as a sum\nX\n\n\u03a8i,ji : Lie(H) \u2192 Lie(H)\n\ni\u2208I\n\n(resp. as the reduction mod p of this sum): it is the usual Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Hasse\u2013Witt\nshift (resp. map) as defined in 3.4.5 and 3.9.\nIn general,\nF SHW (M, \u03c6) := (\u03c8\u0304i,j )i\u2208I, j\u2208S(mi ,max{mi ,\u22121})\ndoes not depend on the choice of (F s (M ))s\u2208S(a,b). If h \u2208 HW (k) (W (k)), then by an\ninner isomorphism between F SHW (M, \u03c6) and F SHW (M, h\u03c6), we mean an isomorphism\ndefined by an element of N + N 0 (k) (cf. also c) and the normalizing part of a) of Step 2 of\n3.13.7.3). Following the pattern of 3.13.7.6, we similarly define the non-compact variant\nnc\nF SHW nc (M, \u03c6) := (\u03c8\u0304i,j\n)i\u2208J, j\u2208S(mi ,max{mi ,1}) ,\n\nwhere J is the subset of I formed by elements i such that Hi is not a subgroup of N0 . It\nis easy to see that all of 3.13.7.1.1 b), 3.13.7.1.1.1, 3.13.7.3, 3.13.7.4 B, 3.13.7.6, 3.13.7.8.2\nand 3.13.7.8.4 3) can be restated in terms of (isomorphism classes) of F SHW (M, h\u03c6) or\nof F SHW nc (M, h\u03c6). We just add two thinks:\n\u2013 in 3.13.7.8.2 c), we can replace stabilizers by group of inner automorphisms of\nFaltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Hasse\u2013Witt (non-compact) maps;\n\u2013 for the parts of a) and b) of Step 2 of 3.13.7.3 referring to centralizers, we need to\ndefine C as the centralizer of the factors of the lower central series of n.\nA final thought: there are a couple of ways to define the Lie stable p-rank of (M, \u03c6)\n(or of F SHW (M, \u03c6)) which can be used to get the analogue of 3.9.4. As we were not\nable to decide on time which is the most practical such way, we postpone to future work\nthe definition of these invariants.\n3.13.8. Reductive deviations. We come back to the beginning of 3.13. So k is\narbitrary. We saw in Example 1 of 2.2.19 that the Shimura adjoint Lie \u03c3-crystal attached\nto C0 is not necessarily of reductive type. The number n1 , with n \u2208 N \u222a {0, \u221e} as the\nsmallest number such that the Shimura adjoint Lie \u03c3-crystal attached to (M, g\u03c6, G) is\nof reductive type, for g \u2208 G(W (k)) congruent to the identity mod pn , is referred as the\n1\n= 0 and 01 = \u221e; if n = \u221e, then g = 1M .\nfirst reductive deviation of C0 . Here \u221e\nWe now assume k = k\u0304. Let p=0 := W (0)(Lie(G), \u03c6) and let p=00 be the Zp -Lie\nsubalgebra of p=0 formed by elements fixed by \u03c6. The length of p=0 /p=00 \u2297Zp W (k) as\na torsion W (k)-module is called the second reductive deviation of C0 .\n372\n\n\fExample. The first (resp. second) reductive deviation of the \u03c3-crystal associated\nto a supersingular elliptic curve over k = k\u0304 is 0 (resp. is 1).\n3.13.9. Toric deviations. We assume k = k\u0304. Let p=0 and p=00 be as in 3.13.8.\nBy the first (resp. second) toric deviation of C, we mean the rational number\ndimW (k) (F 0 (Lie(G)) \u2229 p=0 )\ndimW (k) (p=0 )\n(resp.\n\ndimZp (F 0 (Lie(G))\u2229p=00 )\n).\ndimZp (p=00 )\n\nThe first (resp. second) toric deviation of C0 is defined as\n\nthe greatest first (resp. greatest second) toric deviation of C, with the F 1 -filtration F 1\nof M defining C running through all elements of F (of the beginning of 3.13).\n3.13.8-9 extend naturally to the context of Shimura (filtered) Lie \u03c3-crystals or isocrystals.\n3.14. The case p = 2. Referring to 3.1-13, we essentially used the fact that p > 2 in\nprecisely seven places: twice in 3.5.4 (see also 3.6.6.2), in 3.6.2 (and the subsequent places\ndepending on it, including 3.6.10-11, 3.6.18.0 and 3.9.9 A), in 3.6.18.5.1 and 3.6.18.5.3\n(and so in 3.6.18.5.7 and 3.13.5.1), in the Fact of 3.6.19, in 3.6.20 8), in 3.11.8.1, and in\nStep 2 of 3.13.7.3. We now deal, in a convenient order, with the p = 2 analogues of these\nseven places.\nA. We start with some small remarks. We repeat, cf. 2.2.1 c), that [Fa1, 2.3] works\nfor p = 2 as well (see also the p = 2 analogue of 3.6.18.4.1.1). In 3.6.18.0 (resp. 3.10.8),\nthe p-divisible group DW (k) (resp. D) does not necessarily exist, and if exists, it is not\nalways uniquely determined for p = 2 (resp. it is not always uniquely determined for\np = 2: its existence is argued in 2.2.12.1 1)). Accordingly, for the existence part in\n3.6.18.0, for p = 2, we usually need to assume that k is 1-simply connected (i.e. it has\nno abelian extension of degree 2) or that (M, \u03c6) either does not have slope 0 or does not\nhave slope 1, cf. 2.3.18.1 B and C. So 3.6.18.5 c) does not need to be modified. In the\nparagraph before 3.4.0, for p = 2 the list of cases when the Lie monomorphism iG is not\nan isomorphism is much longer; in fact, in most situations, iG is not an isomorphism. For\np = 2, a) of 3.6.18.10 P1 has to be formulated as follows: \"is associated to a 2-divisible\ngroup over R1 or over R1\u2227 \". The exponential map (in the generalized Shimura context)\nreferred to in 3.6.6.2 for p = 2 does not have the same simplified\nas in the proof of\nPn form\ns\n3.6.6 (i.e. 1M + x mod 4 has to be replaced by a sum 1M + s=1 xs! , where n \u2208 N is such\nthat xn = 0, \u2200x \u2208 2Lie(N\u2212i ); however, its usage does not need to be modified).\nB. The equivalence parts of 3.6.18.5.1 and 3.6.18.5.3 remain true for p = 2 but not\ntheir antiequivalence parts. However, due to the fact that [Fa2, th. 10] is true as well\nfor p = 2, the mentioned antiequivalence parts can be reformulated in weaker forms as\nfollows.\nB0. Exercise. Any filtered \u03c3-crystal over k is associated to a 2-divisible group iff\nk is 1-simply connected. Hint: one implication is a consequence of 2.3.18.1 B and D; for\nthe converse use the part of the proof of 2.3.18.1 B referring to [Og].\n373\n\n\fB1. Proposition. We refer to 3.6.18.5.1 and 3.6.18.5.3 with p = 2. We assume k\nis 1-simply connected. We have:\nA) the quotient of 2 \u2212 DG(Spec(R)) \"under the functor D\" (of 2.2.1.0) is antiequiv\u2207\nalent to the category 2 \u2212 MF[0,1](R) and so to the category 2 \u2212 MF[0,1]\n(R);\n\u2207\nB) any object of MF[0,1]\n(R) is associated (via D) to a finite, flat, commutative group\nscheme of 2-power order over R.\n\nProof: As any object of MF[0,1](R) is the cokernel of an isogeny between 2-divisible\nobjects of MF[0,1](R) (see Fact of 2.2.1.1 6)) and as the equivalence parts of 3.6.18.5.1\nand 3.6.18.5.3 hold for p = 2, B) follows from A). To see A) it is enough to show:\nB2. Lemma. Any morphism n12 : C1 \u2192 C2 between two 2-divisible objects of\n\u2207\nMF[0,1]\n(R) is associated (via D) to a morphism m12 : D2 \u2192 D1 between two 2-divisible\ngroups over R.\nWe first consider the case R = W (k). Let (cf. our assumption on k and B0) Di be\na 2-divisible group over W (k) such that D(Di ) = Ci = (Mi , Fi1 , \u03c6i ), i = 1, 2. We write\nDi as the extension of an \u00e9tale 2-divisible group Ei by a 2-divisible group Fi not having\nslope 0. Ei and Fi are uniquely determined by Ci (cf. 2.3.18.1 C and the fact that the\ncomplex\n0 \u2192 D(Ei ) \u2192 D(Di ) \u2192 D(Fi ) \u2192 0\nis a short exact sequence). So n12 determines uniquely morphisms e12 : E2 \u2192 E1 and\nf12 : F2 \u2192 F1 . We need to show: we can choose D1 and D2 such that e12 and f12 are\ndetermined naturally by a morphism m12 : D2 \u2192 D1 which satisfies D(m12 ) = n12 . Let\nD3 := D1 \u00d7E1 E2 ; it is a 2-divisible group over k. Let (M3 , F31 , \u03c63 ) be its associated\nfiltered \u03c3-crystal.\nBased on 2.3.18.1 D, we can work over W2 (k). What follows is just a functorial\nversion of 2.3.18.1 B (cf. also 2.3.18.1.1). We consider the affine scheme F Pdef defined\nnaturally by the k-vector space defined by the fibre product of the natural k-linear maps\nExt1 (E1W2 (k) , F1W2 (k) ) \u2192 Ext1 (E2W2 (k) , F1W2 (k) )\nand\n\nExt1 (E2W2 (k) , F2W2 (k) ) \u2192 Ext1 (E2W2 (k) , F1W2 (k) ).\n\nSimilarly we consider the affine scheme F Pfil defined naturally by the k-vector space of\nthe similarly constructed fibre product obtained working in the crystalline context (i.e.\nusing lifts mod 4 of the filtrations F11 , F21 and F31 mod 2, etc.). The natural morphism\nF Pdef \u2192 F Pfil\nis a Galois cover (cf. 2.3.18.1.2). So the resulting map\nF Pdef (k) \u2192 F Pfil (k)\n374\n\n\fis surjective. n12 defines naturally an element\n\u03b3n12 \u2208 F Pfil (k).\nWe just need to choose D1 and D2 to be defined naturally by some element\n\u03b3m12 \u2208 F Pdef (k) \u2282 Ext1 (E1W2 (k) , F1W2 (k) ) \u00d7 Ext1 (E2W2 (k) , F2W2 (k) )\nmapping into \u03b3n12 .\nWe come back to the general case: so m \u2208 N \u222a {0} (of 3.6.18) is arbitrary. We\nconsider the Teichm\u00fcller lift z : Spec(W (k)) \u0592\u2192 Spec(R); let IR be the ideal of R defining\nz. We consider a morphism mz12 : D2z \u2192 D1z between two 2-divisible groups over W (k)\nsuch that D(mz12 ) is identifiable with z \u2217 (n12 ). From [Fa2, th. 10] we deduce the existence\nof a uniquely determined 2-divisible group Di over R such that z \u2217 (Di ) = Diz and D(Di )\nis identifiable with Ci in a way compatible with the identification D(Diz ) = z \u2217 (Ci ), i =\n1, 2. There is a uniquely determined morphism m12 : D2 \u2192 D1 such that D(m12 ) is\nidentifiable with n12 in a way compatible with all previous identifications (this is just the\nendomorphism aspect of the uniqueness argument of 2.2.21 presented in connection to\n[BM, ch. 4] and [Me, ch. 4-5]). This proves the Lemma and so the Proposition.\nB3. Remark. We still assume that we are in the context of B1 above. The\nabove proof can be entirely adapted to show that any commutative diagram in the\n\u2207\ncategory 2 \u2212 MF[0,1]\n(R) is associated via the D functor to a commutative digram in\n\u2207\n2 \u2212 DG(Spec(R)). But any morphism between two objects of MF[0,1]\n(R) can be written\nas a natural morphism (defined by f3 and f4 ) Coker(f1 ) \u2192 Coker(f2 ), where f1 , f2 , f3\n\u2207\nand f4 are morphisms between objects of 2 \u2212 MF[0,1]\n(R) such that f3 \u25e6 f1 = f2 \u25e6 f4\n(cf. 2.2.1.1 6) and the first sentence of the above proof). So one gets the following\nimprovement of B) of B1:\n\u2207\nCorollary. The quotient of 2 \u2212 F F (Spec(R)) \"under D\" is MF[0,1]\n(R).\n\nB4. Warning. In A) of B1 above (resp. in the Corollary of B3) some 2-divisible\ngroups are \"forced\" to be isomorphic (resp. some finite, flat, commutative group schemes\nof 2-power order are forced to be isomorphic, while some morphisms between them are\n\"forced\" to be zero).\nB5. We come back to an arbitrary k. The variant 3.6.18.5.7 can be adapted for\np = 2, cf. 2.3.18.1 C: we just have to work either just with trivial \u00e9tale parts or just with\ntrivial multiplicative type parts (i.e. we get two equivalences and two antiequivalences,\nby working with the corresponding full subcategories of the categories of 3.6.18.5.7). One\nsample: The full subcategory of p \u2212 F F (Spec(R)) whose objects have trivial \u00e9tale parts\nis antiequivalent to the full subcategory of p \u2212 MF[0,1](R) whose objects are such that\nthe Newton polygons of their pull backs to \u03c3-crystals over k have no zero slopes.\nB6. Corollary. We refer to 3.6.18.5.1 with p \u2265 2. The category p\u2212DG(Spec(R/pR))\nis antiequivalent (via D) to the category p \u2212 M[0,1] (R) as defined in 2.2.1.6.\n375\n\n\fProof: See [BM, 4.2.4] for the fully faithfulness part. We consider an object\n(MR , \u03a6MR , \u2207MR ) of p \u2212 M[0,1] (R). We consider a direct summand F 1 (MR ) of MR\nsuch that C := (MR , F 1 (MR ), \u03a6MR , \u2207MR ) is an object of p \u2212 M[0,1] (R). If p = 2, we\nneed to assume that F 1 (MR ) is such that the pull back of (MR , F 1 (MR ), \u03a6MR ) via the\nW (k)-valued Teichm\u00fcller lift of Spec(R), is associated to a 2-divisible group over W (k).\nFrom 2.2.21 UP (resp. from 3.6.18.5.3) for p \u2265 2 (resp. for p \u2265 3), we get the essential\nsurjectivity part of D on objects. This ends the proof.\nWe refer to 3.6.18.5.1 with p \u2265 2. We consider an ideal IR of R taken by \u03a6R into\nitself and such that S := R/IR is flat over W (k). Let \u03a6S be the resulting Frobenius lift of\nS. We recall (cf. [BM]) that to any p-divisible group D over Spec(S/pS) it is functorially\nassociated a crystal D(D) on the crystalline site CRIS(S/pS/Spec(Zp )). So as the ideal\npS of S is naturally equipped with a divided power structure and due to the existence of\n\u03a6S , evaluating D(D) at Spec(S) we get a triple (MD , \u03a6D , \u2207D ), with MD a free S-module\nof finite rank, with \u2207D an integrable, nilpotent mod p connection on MD and with \u03a6D\na \u03a6S -linear endomorphism of MD which is \u2207D -parallel. As D lifts to a p-divisible group\nover S, this triple is an object of the category p \u2212 M\u2207 (S) defined in 2.2.1.7 4). So we\nget a contravariant functor\nDS/pS : p \u2212 DG(Spec(S/pS)) \u2192 p \u2212 M\u2207 (S).\nB7. Corollary. DS/pS is onto on objects.\nProof: Let (CS , \u2207) be an object of p \u2212 M\u2207\n[0,1] (S). As in Fact of 2.2.1.1 6), CS is the\nreduction mod IR of an object C of p \u2212 M[0,1](R). \u2207 is the unique connection on the\nunderlying S-module MS of CS such that the pair (CS , \u2207) is an object of p \u2212 M\u2207 (S). To\nsee this, let \u22071 be a second such connection. To show that \u2207\u2212\u22071 \u2208 End(MS )\u2297S \u03a9\u2227\nS/W (k)\nis zero, it is enough to show that \u2207 and \u22071 coincide mod p. Using the notations of\n3.6.18.1.2, we consider the sequence of ideals (Jn )n\u2208N\u222a{0} , with Jn := In + IR of R; by\ninduction on n \u2208 N we get easily that \u2207\u2212\u22071 \u2208 Jn End(MS )\u2297S \u03a9\u2227\nS/W (k) . As \u2229n\u2208N Jn = IR ,\nwe get that \u2207 and \u22071 coincide mod p. So \u2207 = \u22071 .\nSo (CS , \u2207) = DS/pS (DSpec(S/pS) ), where (cf. B6) D is the p-divisible group over\nR/pR corresponding to C. This ends the proof.\nB8. Remark. B6-7 were first obtained (using a slightly different language) in [dJ1,\nth. of intro.]. B7 can be combined with [BM] to reobtain the full form of [dJ1, th. of\nintro.]. Moreover, we have variants of B7 where S is not necessarily flat.\nC. It is easy to see that in 3.5.4 it was not at all essential that p > 2. To see this we\nuse the notations of 3.5.4, with p = 2. The formula (6) of 3.5.4 remains true for p = 2 (it\ncan be checked inside the SL-group of a 3 dimensional vector space over k) but formula\n3.5.4 a) does not. In fact it is easy to see that it fails precisely in the following cases:\n(*) \u1e201 is an adjoint group of Bl Lie type, with l \u2265 1, and \u03b1 is a short root.\nAs (*) is obvious if \u1e201 is of B1 Lie type, to argue (*) we can assume the rank l of \u1e201\nis at least 2. Using the fact that all roots of \u03a61 of the same length are conjugate under\n376\n\n\fthe Weyl group attached to it (for instance, see [Hu1, p. 53]), for the Al (l \u2265 2), Dl\n(l \u2265 4), E6 and E7 Lie types, the situation gets reduced to the A2 Lie type, for which\n3.5.4 a) obviously holds. Similarly, for the Bl (resp. Cl ) Lie type case, with l \u2265 2 (resp.\nl \u2265 3), the situation gets reduced to the B2 Lie type (resp. to the simply connected C2\nLie type): we just need to remark the following two things (valid for l \u2265 2).\na) The standard monomorphism SO(2l + 1) \u0592\u2192 SO(2l + 3) (over any algebraically\nclosed field) lifts to a monomorphism Spin(2l + 1) \u0592\u2192 Spin(2l + 3) between simply connected semisimple groups. Here, for i \u2208 {1, 3}, SO(2l + i) denotes a simple adjoint group\nof Bl+j Lie type, where j = 0 if i = 1 and j = 1 if i = 3.\nb) We have a similar standard monomorphism from the simply connected semisimple\ngroup over k of Cl\u22121 Lie type into the adjoint semisimple group over k of Cl Lie type.\nThe remaining cases, can be studied (the argument of Step 2 of 3.13.7.3 referring\nto [Va2, 3.1.2.1 c)], allows us to shift from positive characteristic to characteristic 0) in\ncharacteristic 0: the fact that 3.5.4 a) holds or not for \u1e201 can be restated in terms of\nsome semisimple group of B1 Lie type are or are not all simply connected). But the\nsituation pertaining to the B2 Lie type (adjoint or not, can be read out from [Bou3, (II)\nof p. 201]). This ends the argument for (*).\nOn the other hand [BT, 4.2-3] and [Bo2, 3.16] treat the case p = 2 as well and so\nformula (7) still holds for p = 2. So 3.5.4 holds for p = 2 provided we are in the context\nof Shimura \u03c3-crystals or in a generalized Shimura context not involving adjoint groups of\nBl Lie type. To see that 3.5.4 holds as well for the generalized Shimura context involving\ngroups whose derived subgroups have normal, simple subgroups which are adjoint and of\nBl Lie type, we can proceed in many ways, like:\ni) we shift from an adjoint context to a simply connected context;\nii) we replace the argument based on 3.5.4 a) and made at the level of Lie algebras\nin characteristic p, either by a refined one or by an argument at the level of reductive\ngroups in characteristic 0;\niii) we refer to J below (for l \u2265 2).\nFor the convenience of the reader we include here one way to argue things via ii). In\nthe adjoint Bl Lie type context, the Fact of 3.5.4 has to be restated as follows:\n\u0001\n\u0001\nL\nFact. The Lie subalgebra g2 (\u2212\u03b4)\u2229g1 \u2297W (k) k of \u1e211 is s\u0304a and\ng2 (\u03b1) \u2229\n\u03b1\u2208H\n\u2229[0,1]\n2\n\u0001\ng1 \u2297W (k) k is P\u0304\u03b51 .\n\nProof: We keep using the notations of 3.5.3, with p = 2. As we are dealing with\nthe Bl Lie type, |A| = 1. For the rest of the argument we just use this fact. By reasons\nof dimensions we have (cf. the Fact of 3.4.5.1)\n\u0001\n(1)\ng2 (\u2212\u03b4) \u2229 g1 \u2297W (k) k = s\u0304\u03b51 = F 1 (g1 ) \u2297W (k) k.\n\u0001\nL\n1\nWe consider the parabolic subgroup P\u0304\u22650\nof \u1e201 whose Lie algebra is\ng\n(\u03b1)\n\u2229\n2\n\u03b1\u2208H2 \u2229[0,1]\n\u0001\n1\ng1 \u2297W (k) k. Using (1) and Fact of 2.2.11.1 we get that P\u0304\u22650 is a subgroup of P\u0304\u03b51 . So, as\n377\n\n\fin the proof of 3.4.8, replacing \u03c62 by g\u03032 \u03c62 g\u03032 , with g\u03032 \u2208 P\u03b51 (W (k)), we can assume\nM\n\u0001\n\u0001\n(IN CL)\ng2 (\u03b1) \u2229 g1 \u2282 p\u03b51 .\n\u03b1\u2208H2 \u2229[0,1]\n\nL\nPerforming the same thing for every i \u2208 I1 , we get that we can assume \u03b1\u2208H2 \u2229[0,1] g2 (\u03b1) \u2282\nF 0 (g0 ). This together with (1) and its analogues with i \u2208 I1 , implies that\nM\nM\n(\ng2 (\u03b1)/g2 (\u2212\u03b4),\ng2 (\u03b1)/g2 (\u2212\u03b4), \u03c62 )\n\u03b1\u2208H2 \u2229[0,1]\n\n\u03b1\u2208H2 \u2229[0,1]\n\nis a p-divisible object of MF[0,0] (W (k)).\n\n\u0001\nSo (g0 , \u03c62 ) has no slopes in the interval (0, \u2212\u03b4) and so g2 (\u2212\u03b4) \u2229 g1 \u2297W (k) k is the\n1\nLie algebra of the unipotent radical of P\u0304\u22650\n. So from (1) and the Fact of 2.2.11.1 we get\nthat in (INCL) we have in fact equality. From this the Fact follows\nD. In 3.6.2 it was crucial that p > 2. So everything in 3.6.1-18, which is not based\non 3.6.2 or on the antiequivalence parts of 3.6.18.5.1 and 3.6.18.5.3, remains true for the\ncase p = 2. In other words, everything in 3.6.1-18 except 3.6.2, the antiequivalence parts\nof 3.6.18.5.1 and 3.6.18.5.3, 3.6.10-11 and the whole of 3.6.14, remains true for the case\np = 2; in connection to 3.6.18.5.7 see B5. In 3.13.5.1 iv), for p = 2 we need to replace\nDG by its filtered F -crystal.\nE. Despite D above, it is possible to modify the statement and the proofs of 3.6.14.1-4\naccordingly (i.e. without relying on 3.6.2). We have a couple of variants.\nFirst, if the Shimura-ordinary type associated to the p = 2 SHS (f, L(2) , v) has no\nintegral slopes, then we do not need any modification to 3.6.2 and so to the whole of\n3.6.14 (cf. D and 2.3.18.1 C and D; in such a context the part of the proof of 3.6.14.1\ndepending on 2.2.1.1 2) still holds for p = 2 and so the part of the proof of 3.6.14.1\nreferring to [BLR] still applies). Warning: this has limited applications; however p = 2\nvariants of 4.6.1 1) below (for instance involving the A1 Lie type, cf. 2.3.18 A) point out\nthat occasionally it does apply.\nSecond, we replace assumptions SA1-2 by the restatement of property G) of the\nproof of 3.6.14.1, where we do not mention anything about 2-divisible groups; so we work\nentirely in terms of (non-filtered) F -crystals with tensors. So 3.6.14 and 3.6.14.1, under\nthe logical (abstract) restatement involving just F -crystals, are true as well for a p = 2\nSHS (in terms of this restatement, the mentioned part referring to [BLR] can be skipped\nentirely).\nThird, the proof of Theorem 2 of 3.15.1 below points out that we can still work in\nthe context of 2-divisible groups over k-schemes (see also 3.15.2 below). In other words,\nin the second variant, we can replace F -crystals by p-divisible groups (over k-schemes).\nFourth, we have a variant in which we already assume that the things \"are fine\" mod\n4, i.e. (besides S1 or S2) we assume that a scheme Spec(T2 ) as in the proof of 3.6.14.1\ndoes exist a priori.\n378\n\n\fSimilarly, 3.6.10-11 have to be stated just in terms of filtered F -crystals and not\nof 2-divisible groups. The fact that 3.9.9 A, B and C still holds for p = 2 is implied\nby the proof of Theorem 2 of 3.15.1 below: we just need to be in a context of smooth\ngroup schemes over W (k) so that the part of the mentioned proof pertaining to lifts of\ncocharacters still applies (cf. also 3.15.3 5) below).\nF. In 3.6.20 8), for the versal (resp. uni plus versal) context we need to assume k is\n1-simply connected (resp. that the 2-divisible groups over k defined by special fibres of\nthe ones considered in 3.6.19 i), do not have either slope 0 or slope 1), cf. 2.3.18.1 B and\nC.\nG. We refer to 3.6.19. a) of its Fact remains true. Similarly, its Theorem remains\ntrue: it is stated already in terms of p-divisible groups and so (cf. also the extra assumption (EXTRA) of 3.6.19) for p = 2 we do not get into trouble with D or E above.\nSimilarly, its variants iv) to vi) mentioned in 3.6.19 E still remain true. In connection to\nits variant vii) we refer to 4.14.3 K and to [Va5].\nH. In connection to 3.11.8.1 for p = 2, it is 2.13.8.2 which points out that we can\nstill define \u03c1\u03b1 's. Related to \u03c1 we need to assume that either (M, \u03c6) does not have slope\n0 or 1 (cf. 2.3.18.1 C) or \u03c1 is defined using a 2-divisible group over W (k) as in I below.\nI. Let (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ) be a Shimura-canonical lift of a (non-necessarily quasisplit) Shimura \u03c3-crystal with an emphasized family of tensors over a perfect field k of\ncharacteristic 2. Let Dk be the 2-divisible group over k having (M, \u03c6) as its associated \u03c3crystal. As pointed out in 2.3.18.1, it can happen that there is more than one 2-divisible\ngroup over W (k) lifting Dk and such that its associated filtered \u03c3-crystal is (M, F 1 , \u03c6).\nHowever, from 3.11.1 a) (and 2.3.18.1 C) we get that there is a unique such lift D which is\na direct sum of: an \u00e9tale 2-divisible group, of a multiplicative type 2-divisible group and\nof a 2-divisible group whose slopes are rational numbers of the interval (0, 1). We refer\nto the pair (D, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ) (resp. (Dk , (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J )) as a Shimura-canonical (resp. Shimuraordinary) 2-divisible group over W (k) (resp. over k).\nJ. To show that 3.13.7.3 (and so implicitly all of 3.13.7.1-2 and of 3.13.7.4-8) still\nholds for p = 2, we just need to point out that b) of Step 2 of 3.13.7.3 applies in Step\n3 of 3.13.7.3 in the same manner, as we are interested in k-valued points of Gad\nk and so\nwe can work equally well with PC red instead of PC . However, referring to b) of Step 2 of\n3.13.7.3, we have the following improvement of it (for the Shimura adjoint Lie \u03c3-context):\nSupplement. We assume p = 2 and that there is a Shimura pair (H, [\u03bc]) such\nthat P is the parabolic subgroup of H whose Lie algebra is the maximal Lie subalgebra of\nLie(H) on which \u03bc acts via the identity and the trivial cocharacter of Gm . If moreover\nH is not of A1 Lie type, then PC red = PC and so C = N .\nProof: Let T be a maximal torus of P . Let \u03a6 be the set of roots of the action AC\nof T (via inner conjugation) on Lie(H). Let \u03a60 (resp. \u03a61 ) be the subset of \u03a6 formed\nby the roots of the action of T on Lie(P ) (resp. on n). As H is adjoint, AC is faithful.\nBased on the proof of b) of Step 2 of 3.13.7.3, we just need to show PC red = PC . So,\n379\n\n\ffollowing the pattern of the part of the Claim of 3.5.4 referring to |A| = 1 and involving\nnormalization, we just need to show that:\nFact. For any \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a6 \\ \u03a60 , there is \u03b2 \u2208 \u03a61 , such that \u03b1 + \u03b2 \u2208 \u03a60 and the pair (\u03b1, \u03b2)\nis not irregular in the sense of [BT, 4.3] (so the p = 2 analogue of 3.5.4 (6) holds for it).\nThis Fact can be easily checked (as in Case 1 of 3.5.4) starting from [Bou2, planche I\nto VI] and [BT, 4.3 (i)]. Based on the list of irregular cases of loc. cit., the only situations\nwhich need extra details are the ones when H is of Bl or Cl Lie type, l \u2208 N, with l \u2265 2.\nChoosing a Borel subgroup of P containing T , we get an ordering of \u03a6 such that the set\n\u03a6+ of positive roots is included in \u03a60 . Based on loc. cit., we can assume \u03b1 is short. For\nfuture references we assume just that \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a6 \\ \u03a61 . We first deal with the Bl Lie type\nPl\ncase. With the standard notations of [Bou2, planche II], if \u03b1 = \u2212 i=m \u03b1i , with m \u2265 1,\nPm\u22121\nPl\nthen we can take \u03b2 = ( i=1 \u03b1i ) + 2( i=m \u03b1i ) if m \u2265 2 and the maximal positive root if\nPl\nPm\u22121\nm = 1. If \u03b1 = i=m \u03b1i , with m \u2265 2, then we can take \u03b2 = i=1 \u03b1i . In both situations,\n\u03b2 is long, and we are not in an irregular situation.\nPj\nWe now assume H is of Cl Lie type. If \u03b1 = \u2212 i=m \u03b1i , with 1 \u2264 m \u2264 j < l \u2212 1,\nPl\u22121\nPl\nPl\u22121\nthen we can take \u03b2 = \u03b1l + 2 i=m \u03b1i . We now assume \u03b1 = \u2212 i=m \u03b1i \u2212 i=n \u03b1i , with\n1 \u2264 m \u2264 n \u2264 l \u2212 1.\nwe can take \u03b2 to be the maximal root. If n = 1,\nPlIf n 6= 1,Pthen\nl\u22121\nthen we take \u03b2 = i=1 \u03b1i + i=j \u03b1i , where j \u2208 S(1, l) is such that \u03b1 and \u03b2 are not\northogonal. In this last case, \u03b2 is short but is not perpendicular on \u03b1; so we are through\n(cf. [BT, 4.3 (i)]). This proves the Fact and ends the proof of the Supplement.\n3.15. Some conclusions. This section is formed by different conclusions to 3.1-14;\nthey are thought as refined versions of parts of 3.1-14 which can be obtained by thoroughly\ncombining different parts of it. In 3.15.1-6 and 3.15.9 we deal with Dieudonn\u00e9 theories,\nversal deformations and applications of them. In 3.15.7-8 and 3.15.10 we exploit to a\nmuch greater extend 3.6.15 B. In particular, we get:\n\u2013 a new principle (the boudedness one, see 3.15.7);\n\u2013 a new proof (see 3.15.8) of the specialization theorem;\n\u2013 a new proof in a slightly more general context (see 3.15.10.1) of [dJO, 4.1].\n3.15.1. Versal global deformations. 3.6.1.3 allows us (cf. 3.6.9 3)) to strengthen\n3.1.8 and its p = 2 analogue of 3.1.8.1. Let p \u2265 2 be an arbitrary prime and let k\u0303 be an\narbitrary perfect field of characteristic p. We have:\nTheorem 1. Any p-divisible group over k\u0303 admits a versal (global) deformation over\nthe p-adic completion of an N-pro-\u00e9tale, affine scheme Spec(R1 ) over a smooth, affine\nW (k\u0303)-scheme Spec(R) (and so also over an N-pro-\u00e9tale, affine scheme Spec(R\u03041 ) over a\nsmooth, affine k\u0303-scheme Spec(R\u0304)), of whose Kodaira\u2013Spencer map is an isomorphism.\nWe can choose R1 such that Spec(R1 /pR1 ) is a geometrically connected, AG k-scheme\nand the k\u0303-morphism Spec(R1 /pR1 ) \u2192 Spec(R/pR) is surjective. Moreover the p-divisible\ngroup over the generic point of Spec(R1 /pR1 ) (or of R\u0304) is ordinary.\nSimilarly, in the relative context, we have:\n380\n\n\fTheorem 2. Let D(W (k\u0303)) be a Shimura p-divisible group over W (k\u0303). Then there\nis a smooth W (k\u0303)-algebra R, an N-pro-\u00e9tale, affine R-scheme Spec(R1 ), and a Shimura\np-divisible group D over Spec(R1\u2227 ) such that:\na) in a W (k\u0303)-valued point z of Spec(R1\u2227 ), D becomes (isomorphic to) D(W (k\u0303));\nb) D is a uni plus versal (global) deformation (see 3.6.19 B);\nc) Spec(R1 /pR1 ) is a geometrically connected, AG k-scheme and the morphism\nSpec(R1 /pR1 ) \u2192 Spec(R/pR) is surjective.\nMoreover, the resulting Shimura \u03c3k\u0303g -crystal C over the algebraic closure k\u0303g of the\nfield of fractions of R1 /pR1 is Shimura-ordinary.\nProof: The parts involving (Shimura-) ordinariness of the above Facts are a consequence of 3.12.1 and its proof (cf. also 3.14 for p = 2). The case p \u2265 3 is covered, by\ntaking slices, by 3.6.1.3, 3.6.2 and 3.12.1: we just have to perform 3.6.11 in the context\nwhen H\u0303 is as in the first paragraph after 3.6.14. The fact that the above Theorems hold\nas well for p = 2, can be checked as follows.\nWe can refer just to Theorem 2. Copying 3.6 i), parts of 3.6.0-1, and the case n = 1\nof 3.6.1.3, we need to start with a smooth W (k\u0303)-algebra R such that:\ni) it has a connected special fibre;\nii) its spectrum has a W (k\u0303)-valued point z and there is a triple (Spec(R), bR , z) which\nis a potential-deformation sheet in the sense of 3.6.9.1 (so the R/pR-module \u03a9R/pR/k\u0303 is\nfree);\niii) its 2-adic completion is equipped with the Frobenius lift \u03a6R obtained via bR in\nthe same way \u03a6U of 3.6.9.1 is obtained (via bU ); so (in z) we have a property similar to\nthe one of 2.3.15 c): in particular, z is a Teichm\u00fcller lift;\niv) there is a 2-divisible object C with cycles of MF[0,1](R), which in z becomes\n(through pull back) the 2-divisible object Cz with cycles of MF[0,1](W (k\u0303)) defined by\nD(W (k\u0303)), which is modeled (as in 2.2.10 or 3.6.0-1) on Cz and whose truncation mod 2\nis equipped with a uni plus versal connection, respecting the extra \"Shimura structure\"\n(so the relative dimension of R over W (k\u0303) is dd(C));\nv) the underlying R\u2227 -module of C together with its cycles, is obtained by extension\nof scalars from a pair (M\u0303 , (t\u0303\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ) over W (k\u0303); so it is free, and the referred \"Shimura\nstructure\" is defined by a reductive subgroup G\u0303 of GL(M\u0303 ) (so the connection of iv)\nrespects the G\u0303R -action in the sense of 3.6.1.1.1 2)).\nIn connection to iv) we add: working with H\u0303 as mentioned, we always can assume\nthat the part on uni plus versality holds (perhaps after passage to an open, affine subscheme of Spec(R) through which z still factors), cf. c) of 3.6.18.7.3 C.\nSo we can \"perform 3.6.1.3\" for C (for n \u2265 2), cf. 3.14 and 3.6.18.4.2. We get: there\nis an N-pro-\u00e9tale morphism Spec(R1 ) \u2192 Spec(R) to which z lifts uniquely (we still denote\nby z this unique lift), such that R1 /2R1 is an integral ring and (cf. also 3.6.18.8.1 and\niii) above) the pull back CR1 of C to Spec(R1 ) is a uni plus versal 2-divisible object with\n381\n\n\f\u2207\ntensors of MF[0,1]\n(R1 ). Let C1 be the F -crystal over R1 /2R1 obtained from CR1 and its\nnatural connection by forgetting its filtration.\n\nLet K1 be the field of fractions of R1 /2R1 . It is a field which is an N-ind-\u00e9tale\nextension of a finitely generated field over k\u0303 and so (see [BM, 1.1.2 (ii)]) it has a finite\n2-basis; R1 /2R1 itself has a finite basis (cf. loc. cit. and ii)) but this is irrelevant for what\nfollows. So the first main result of [dJ2] applies: there is a unique 2-divisible group GK1\nover K1 whose F -crystal is obtained from C1 by natural pull back. It is worth pointing out\nthat the existence of GK1 can be deduced as well from [Fa2, th. 10] using standard descent.\nWe sketch the argument. The k\u0303-valued points of Spec(R1 /2R1 ) are dense: for instance,\ncf. 3.6.8.1.2 a) and 3.6.18.4.2 b); to be compared with 3.6.1.3 5). Even better, we can\nassume that each point of Spec(R1 /pR1 ) of codimension 1 specializes to a k\u0303-valued point\n\u1ef9, cf. 3.6.8.1.2 b'). Moreover, from loc. cit. we get (see also 3.6.18.3.1) that the F -crystal\nc\u1ef9 of the local ring R\u1ef9 of (any such point) \u1ef9 obtained naturally by\nover the completion R\npulling back C1 , is the F -crystal of a 2-divisible group; it is uniquely determined (for\ninstance, cf. [BM, 4.2.4]). Using this and standard Galois descent in an affine context\nc\u1ef9 ) \u2192 Spec(R\u1ef9 ) is regular, see\n(based on the fact that the natural morphism m\u1ef9 : Spec(R\n[Ma]), we deduce that the 2-divisible group over the perfection of K1 obtained naturally\nvia C1 and classical Dieudonn\u00e9 theory, is in fact naturally definable over K1 .\nBut now, the fact that the 2-divisible group we got over K1 extends uniquely to a\n2-divisible group GR1 /2R1 over R1 /2R1 in the way prescribed by C1 , is standard. One very\nfast way to prove this goes as follows. We consider first a local ring V of R1 /2R1 which\nis a DVR. Let \u03c0V be a uniformizer of V and let V1 be a faithfully flat, finite V -algebra\nwhich is a DVR having \u03c0V as a uniformizer, a residue field which is the perfection of the\nresidue field of V , and whose field of fractions is an algebraic extension of V [ \u03c01V ]. Using\nthe above part referring to m\u1ef9 , we know that there is a local, faithfully flat, V -algebra\nV2 , which is a DVR such that:\n\u2013 the pull back GV2 [ \u03c01\n\nV\n\nSpec(V2 );\n\n]\n\nof GK1 to Spec(V2 [ \u03c01V ]) extends to a 2-divisible group over\n\n\u2013 the morphism m2 : Spec(V2 ) \u2192 Spec(V ) is regular.\nFrom 3.14 B6 we get that there is a unique 2-divisible group GVb over the completion\n1\nc1 of V1 whose F -crystal over V\nc1 is obtained from C1 by natural pull back. As the field\nV\nc1 has a finite 2-basis, using again [dJ2] (or using descent as above or\nof fractions of V\n[BM, 4.2.4]) we get that the notations are fitting each other, i.e. the generic fibre of GVb\n1\nis indeed obtained from GK1 by natural pull back. So (simple argument at the level of\nV1 -lattices) GV1 [ \u03c01 ] extends to a 2-divisible group GV1 over V1 . Though we do not need\nV\n\nthis, it is worth pointing out that there is a unique such extension, cf. [dJ3, 1.2]; the\nreason we do not need this: the F -crystal of GV1 is automatically (cf. the construction of\nGV1 ) the logic pull back of C1 . Standard descent involving the V -algebras V1 and V2 (we\ncan assume V2 is complete and so, as m2 is regular, V2 \u2297V V1 is a DVR), shows that GK1\nextends to a 2-divisible group over V . Using [dJ3, 1.1] (V has a 2-basis, cf. [BM, 1.1.2\n382\n\n\f(ii) and (v)] and the fact that Spec(R1 /2R1 ) is an N-pro-\u00e9tale Spec(R/2R)-scheme) or\nusing descent as above, we get that this extension is as predicted by C1 . But now, the\npassage from points of codimension 1 to the whole of Spec(R1 /2R1 ) is a local statement\nfor the faithfully flat topology of Spec(R1 /2R1 ) and so we can apply again the part of\nthe previous paragraph referring to [Fa2, th. 10] (or to [dJ2], as the field of fraction of\nW (k\u03031 )[[x1 , ..., xdd(Cz )) ]], with k\u03031 an algebraic field extension of k\u0303, has a finite 2-basis).\nThe trouble with p = 2 is in lifting things modulo 2 to things modulo 4 (cf. 2.3.18.1\nA to C), i.e. we have trouble with filtrations. We can assume GR1 /2R1 [4] is obtained by\npulling back a finite, flat, commutative group scheme G(4)R/2R over R/2R. Let R\u0302 be the\ncompletion of R (or of R1 ) w.r.t. its maximal ideal defining z. We can now go around\nthis \"filtration trouble\", using [Fa2, th. 10 and rm. iii) after it]: from loc. cit. we deduce\n(cf. also 2.2.9 1) and 2.2.1.2) the existence of a cocharacter \u03bcR\u0302 : Gm \u2192 G\u0303R\u0302 producing\nas usual a direct sum decomposition M\u0303 \u2297W (k\u0303) R\u0302 = FR\u03021 \u2295 FR\u03020 such that the pull back of\nC1 and its tensors through the logical W (k\u0303)-morphism Spec(R\u0302) \u2192 Spec(R1 ), when its\nunderlying R\u0302-module is endowed with the filtration defined by FR\u03021 , is a 2-divisible object\n\n\u2207\nwith tensors of MF[0,1]\n(R\u0302) associated to a Shimura 2-divisible group over Spec(R\u0302) lifting\n\nD(W (k\u0303)) and lifting (cf. 3.14 B6) GR\u0302/2R\u0302 . From this and [BLR, th. 12 of p. 83] (applied\nvery much the same as in 3.6.14.4 but only once) we get that by passing to an \u00e9tale\nW (k\u0303)-morphism Spec(R\u2032 ) \u2192 Spec(R), we can assume that:\nvi) G(4)R/2R lifts to a finite, flat, commutative group scheme G(4) over R, such that\n\u2207\nthe object C(4) := D(G(4)R/2R ) of MF[0,1]\n(R) has the property that the filtration F41 of\nthe underlying R/4R-module M\u0303 \u2297W (k\u0303) R/4R of C(4) respects the extra Shimura structure\nin the logical way (i.e. it is defined as usual by a cocharacter \u03bc4 : Gm \u2192 G\u0303R/4R );\nvii) G(4) in z is the kernel of the multiplication by 4 of (the 2-divisible group of)\nD(W (k\u0303)).\nBased on properties of lifting cocharacters (see [SGA3, Vol. II, 3.6 of p. 48]; to be\ncompared with [Va2, 5.3.2]) F41 \u2297R/4R R1 /4R1 lifts to a filtration F 1 of the R1\u2227 -module\nM\u0303 \u2297W (k\u0303) R1\u2227 underlying C1 in such a way that we still get a 2-divisible object with tensors\n\u2207\nC2 of MF[0,1]\n(R1 ). Moreover, we can assume that C2 in the factorization z\u0303 of z through\nSpec(R1 ) is still Cz . By replacing R/2R as well by a suitable localization of it, from\n3.6.18.4.5 we get: we can assume that c) of Theorem 2 holds. So the above two Facts\nfollow from the following Claim:\nClaim. G(4)R\u22271 lifts, as prescribed by C2 , to a 2-divisible group GR\u22271 over Spec(R1\u2227 )\nin such a way that, when endowed naturally with tensors, in z\u0303 it is D(W (k\u0303)).\nProof: [Me, ch. 5, 1.6 and 2.3.4-5] implies there is a precisely one way to lift GR1 /2R1\nto a 2-divisible group GR1 /4R1 over Spec(R1 /4R1 ) such that its 4-torsion is the pull back\nof G(4) to Spec(R1 /4R1 ). From [Me, ch. 5, 1.6] we deduce, via a natural limit process,\nthat there is a unique way to lift GR1 /4R1 to a 2-divisible group GR1 over Spec(R1\u2227 ) such\n\u2207\nthat its associated 2-divisible object of MF[0,1]\n(R1 ) is C2 . The second part of the Claim\n383\n\n\f(involving D(W (k\u0303))) is obvious (cf. 2.3.18.1 D and the construction of GR1 ). This proves\nthe Claim.\n3.15.2. The variant of the Fact of 3.6.19 modulo p. Let X be a W (k\u0303)-scheme\nwhich locally in the Zariski topology is a pro-\u00e9tale scheme over a smooth W (k\u0303)-scheme.\nWe consider the category\nM\u2207\n[0,1] (X)\ndefined as follows. If X = Spec(R) is affine and \u03a6R is a Frobenius lift of R\u2227 , then:\n\u2013 its objects are formed by quadruples (M, \u03a6M , \u03a61M , \u2207M ), where M is an R-module\nendowed with a \u03a6R -linear endomorphism \u03a6M and with a \u03a6R -linear map \u03a61M : F\u0303 1 (M ) \u2192\nM , with F\u0303 1 (M ) as the pull back of the R/pR-submodule of M/pM which is the kernel of\n\u03a6M mod p via the natural R-epimorphism M \u0589 M/pM , and where \u2207M is a connection\non M , with the property that locally in the Zariski topology of X it can be extended\nto a quintuple (M, F 1 , \u03a6M , \u03a61M , \u2207M ), with F 1 \u2282 F\u0303 1 (M ), such that denoting by \u03a61M |F 1\nthe restriction of \u03a61M to F 1 , the quadruple (M, F 1 , \u03a6M , \u03a61M |F 1 , \u2207M ) is an object of\n\u2207\nMF[0,1]\n(R);\n\u2013 its morphisms from such a quadruple into a similar one (M1 , \u03a6M1 , \u03a61M1 , \u2207M1 ) are\ngiven by parallel (in the natural sense) R-linear maps f : M \u2192 M1 such that \u03a6M1 \u25e6 f =\nf \u25e6 \u03a6M (so f (F\u0303 1 (M )) \u2282 F\u0303 1 (M1 )) and \u03a61M1 \u25e6 f = f \u25e6 \u03a61M .\nIf X is not affine, then we consider an arbitrary cover of X by open, affine subschemes,\nand we glue triples as above using the standard gluing arguments of [Fa1, 2.3] (cf. also\n2.2.1 c) for p = 2); due to existence of F 1 's, these arguments apply entirely to the\nnon-filtered context of M\u2207\n[0,1] (X).\nWe also consider the category\n\u2207\nMV[0,1]\n(X)\n\ndefined as follows. If X = Spec(R) is affine and \u03a6R is as above, then the objects of\n\u2207\nMV[0,1]\n(X) are quadruples\n(M, \u03a6M , VM , \u2207M ),\nwith M , \u03a6M and \u2207M as above, with VM : M \u2192 M \u2297R \u03a6R R an R-linear map such that\nby identifying \u03a6M with an R-linear map \u03a6M : M \u2297R \u03a6R R \u2192 M we have\n\u03a6M \u25e6 VM = p1M and VM \u25e6 \u03a6M = p1M \u2297R \u03a6R R\n(i.e. VM is a Verschiebung map), which locally in the \u00e9tale topology of X, are obtained\nfrom an object of M\u2207\n[0,1] (X) in the logical way (here by \"logical\" we mean nothing else\n1\n1\nbut: if F and \u03a6M are as above, then we have VM \u25e6 \u03a61M (x) = x, \u2200x \u2208 F 1 , cf. 2.2.1.0\n(VPHIONE)). If X is not affine, then we consider an arbitrary cover of X by open,\naffine subschemes, and we glue quadruples as above using standard gluing arguments (of\n\u2207\n(X) are (as above) the\ncrystals on Xk in coherent sheaves). The morphisms of MV[0,1]\nlogical ones.\n384\n\n\fFact 1 of 2.2.1.0 implies: we have a natural identification of the category M\u2207\n[0,1] (X)\n\u2207\nwith a subcategory (not necessarily full) of MV[0,1]\n(X). We have:\nTheorem. The category of finite, flat, commutative group schemes of p-power rank\nover Xk\u0303 which locally in the \u00e9tale topology of X lift to finite, flat, commutative group\n\u2207\nschemes over X, is antiequivalent to the category MV[0,1]\n(X).\nProof: The functor achieving this antiequivalence of categories is the crystalline\nDieudonn\u00e9 functor D (see [BBM, ch. 3]) evaluated at (the thickening of Xk defined by)\nX \u2227 . D is fully faithful, cf. [BM, 4.2.6]. Based on this and standard descent, to check that\nit is essentially surjective on objects, we can work locally in the (N-pro-) \u00e9tale topology;\nin particular we can assume X = Spec(R) is an affine scheme. We fix a Frobenius lift\n\u03a6R of R\u2227 . So, the same argument based on [EGA IV, 8.5.2] and used to prove the Fact\nof 3.6.19, allows us to assume R is a smooth W (k\u0303)-algebra; warning: not to complicate\nnotations, even when we use below the N-pro-\u00e9tale topology, we still refer to X. The\ncase p \u2265 3 is a consequence of 2.2.1.1 2), cf. the above definition of M\u2207\n[0,1] (X) involving\n\"locally in the Zariski topology\".\nThe case p = 2 can be deduced from the proof of 3.15.1 and the moduli principle\nin the form of 3.14 D, 3.6.18.4.2 and 3.6.18.5.2. This goes as follows. We can assume\nwe are dealing with an object O of M\u2207\n[0,1] (X), which is obtained from an object Of\n\u2207\nof MF[0,1](X) by forgetting the filtration. We can also assume (cf. Fact of 2.2.1.1 6))\nthat Of , when viewed without connection, lifts to a 2-divisible object C of MF[0,1](X),\ni.e. it is the cokernel of an isogeny mf : Cs \u0592\u2192 C between two 2-divisible objects of\nMF[0,1](X). But in the N-pro-\u00e9tale topology of X, C can be viewed as a 2-divisible\n\u2207\nobject of MF[0,1]\n(X) lifting Of (i.e., using connections, mf can be viewed locally in the\n\u2207\nN-pro-\u00e9tale topology of X as an isogeny m\u2207\nf between 2-divisible objects of MF[0,1] (X)\nhaving Of as its cokernel; argument: this is just an abstract extension of the proof of\n3.6.18.5.2, cf. 3.6.18.5.4 1)).\nSo, from the proof of Theorem 2 of 3.15.1 involving the existence of GR1 /2R1 and\nfrom the fully faithfulness of D (in the context of 2-divisible groups over R1 /2R1 ; see\n\u2207\n[BM, 4.2.6]), we get that in the N-pro-\u00e9tale topology of X, the object of MV[0,1]\n(X)\nnaturally defined by O is associated (via D) to a finite, flat, commutative group scheme\nG of 2-power order over Xk\u0303 : G is the kernel of an isogeny i12 : D1 \u2192 D2 between two\n2-divisible groups over Xk\u0303 . i12 is defined via: D(i12 ) is the morphism m\u2207\nf but viewed (by\n\u2207\nforgetting filtrations) as a morphism of p \u2212 M[0,1](X). We can assume G lifts to a finite,\nflat, commutative group scheme over X: using Artin's approximation theorem this is a\nconsequence of A) and B6 of 3.14 (applied in the context of the pull back of m\u2207\nf over\ncompletions of henselizations of localizations of X w.r.t. its maximal points); but as any\nfinite, flat group scheme is of finite presentation, we can replace the N-pro-\u00e9tale topology\nof X by the \u00e9tale topology of X. This proves the Theorem.\n3.15.3. Comments and variants. 1) The expectation of 3.6.8.9.1 gets translated:\nin the two Theorems of 3.15.1, (at least if k\u0303 is \"almost\" algebraically closed in some sense)\nit should be possible to avoid the \"complication\" with N-pro-\u00e9tale morphisms (and so\n385\n\n\f \u0304 in connection to Theorem 1, this is\nto avoid introducing R1 ). For the case k\u0303 = k\u0303,\nachieved (using extra tools) in (a stronger form in) 4.12.12 and 4.12.12.2. Here we just\nadd: the (ineffective) existence of G(4) can be deduced as well from [Il, 4.8] and Artin's\napproximation theorem.\n2) The argument of 3.15.2 involving the essential surjectivity part (on objects) used\nfor p = 2 works as well for p \u2265 3.\n3) We have a logical variant of 3.15.2 in the context of the spectrum of a regular\nW (k\u0303)-algebra of formal power series. It can be proved in the same way: instead of\nreferring to 3.15.1, we can just quote directly 3.6.18.5.1 (for p \u2265 3) and A) of 3.14 B1\n(for p = 2). Even better, we have:\nCorollary 1. 3.15.2 remains true, if instead of X we use its completion X\u0302Y along\na closed subscheme Y which is formally smooth over W (k\u0303).\n\u2207\nProof: MV[0,1]\n(X\u0302Y ) is defined as follows. We can restrict (via gluing arguments\n\nas in 3.15.2) to local charts. So we can assume X\u0302Y = Spf(R), with R a W (k\u0303)-algebra.\n\u2207\n\u2207\nWe take MV[0,1]\n(X\u0302Y ) to be MV[0,1]\n(Spec(R)) defined as in 3.15.1. It is well known that,\nlocally in the Zariski topology of Yk\u0303 , the completion of Xk\u0303 along Yk\u0303 still has a finite pbasis (for instance, see [dJ2, 1.1.3]); so the fully faithfulness part of the Corollary follows\nfrom [BM, 4.1.1]. Using an entirely similar algebraization process as in 3.6.20 3), we\nget (from Theorem of 3.15.2) the essential surjectivity part of the Corollary (the part\ninvolving lifts of finite, flat, commutative groups schemes over X\u0302Yk to ones over X\u0302Y in\nthe \u00e9tale topology is as in the last paragraph of 3.15.2).\n4) Using the proofs of 3.15.1-2, we get a second proof of b) of the Fact of 3.6.19. It\nhas the advantage that it entirely avoids the use of the language of Fontaine's comparison\ntheory with Wm (Fp )-coefficients, m \u2208 N (we recall that the proof of [Fa1, 7.1] relies on\nsuch a theory). Warning: in the way we have presented the things, by avoiding Fontaine's\ncomparison theory, we implicitly use [Fa2, th. 10] (or alternatively [dJ2-3]).\n5) Putting aside the Shimura-ordinariness part of Theorem 2 of 3.15, a) to c) of\nit can be entirely adapted to the context of 3.6.18.7.0 and even more generally to the\ncontext of 3.6.18.7.1 a).\n6) The spirit of this paper is \"centered\" on perfect fields. However, it can be easily\nchecked that 3.15.2 and Corollary 1 of 3) can be entirely adapted to the case of fields\nhaving a finite p-basis: we just have to use (besides [BM, 4.1.1 or 4.2.6]) an elementary\nvariant of b) of the Fact of 3.6.19 (which allows us to pass 3.15.2 from perfect fields to\n\u2207\nfields having a finite p-basis), in the context of the categories MV[0,1]\n(\u2217). Warning: if we\nare dealing with a mfield k0 having a finite p-basis, the sheaves of relative differentials are\n\u2207\nrelative to \u2229m\u2208N k0p and not to k0 and so, even when we are dealing with MV[0,1]\n(W (k0 )),\nnon-trivial connections do show up.\nFor the convenience of the reader we include here a weaker form of the referred elementary variant, which is enough for applications in connection to 3.15.2 and to Corollary\n1 of 3). We start with an \u00e9tale, affine Spec(W (k0 )[x1 , ..., xm])-scheme X, with m \u2208 N; we\nchoose the Frobenius lift of X \u2227 to be the natural one defined by: xi goes to xpi , i = 1, m.\n386\n\n\fWe write k0 as an inductive limit of smooth, integral, finitely generated Fp -algebras R0\u03b1 ,\n\u03b1 \u2208 J , with flat but not-necessarily \u00e9tale transition homomorphisms. Let k0al be the\nfield of fractions of R0\u03b1 . We can assume that each R0\u03b1 lifts to a smooth, integral, finitely\ngenerated Zp -algebra R\u03b1 .\nLet n \u2208 N. We write XWn (k0 ) as the projective limit of Xn\u03b1 , \u03b1 \u2208 J , where each\nXn\u03b1 is an \u00e9tale, affine Spec(Wn (k0\u03b1 ))[x1 , ..., xm])-scheme. Localizing X, we can assume\nthat each Xn\u03b1 lifts to an \u00e9tale, affine Spec(W (k0\u03b1 ))[x1 , ..., xm])-scheme X \u03b1 ; warning: we\ndo not assume the existence of any transition morphisms between X \u03b1 's. The category\n\u2207\nMV[0,1]\n(X) is defined as in 3.15.2. Let C be an object of it annihilated by pn . We can\nassume that the connection on the underlying module of C is involving \u03a9XW (k ) /Wn (kpn ) .\nn 0\n0\nAs \u03a9XW (k ) /Wn (kpn ) is a finitely generated OXWn (k0 ) -module which is the projective limit\nn 0\n0\nof the finitely presented OXn\u03b1 -modules \u03a9Xn\u03b1 /Wn (k0\u03b1 pn ) , as in the proof of the Fact of 3.6.19,\n\u2207\nwe get that C is obtained by pulling back an object C\u03b10 of MV[0,1]\n(X \u03b10 ), for some\n\u03b10 \u2208 J . Localizing R0\u03b10 , we can assume Xk\u03b10 is obtained from an \u00e9tale, affine scheme\nover Spec(R0\u03b10 [x1 , ..., xn]) by natural pull back and that this \u00e9tale scheme lifts to an \u00e9tale,\naffine scheme Y \u03b10 over Spec(R\u03b10 [x1 , ..., xn]). Localizing R0\u03b10 further on, we can assume\n\u2207\n\u03b10\n0\nC\u03b10 lifts to an object C\u03b1\n), via the natural homomorphisms\nlift of MV[0,1] (Y\nR\u03b10 /pn R\u03b10 \u2192W\n \u0303 n (R0\u03b10 ) \u2192 Wn (k0\u03b10 )\n(the first one, cf. the smoothness of R\u03b10 /pn R\u03b10 , just lifts the natural identification\nR\u03b10 /pR\u03b10 = W1 (R0\u03b10 ); it is trivial to check that, as denoted, it is an isomorphism).\n0\nApplying Theorem of 3.15.2 to C\u03b1\nlift , we get that C is associated to a finite, flat, group\nn\nscheme annihilated by p over Xk which locally in the \u00e9tale topology lifts to a group\nscheme over X \u2227 (and so \u2013via [BLR, th. 12 of p. 83]\u2013 over X).\nThe passage from the smooth context to the formally smooth context is entirely the\nsame as the algebraization process of 3.6.20 3): we end up not with Y \u03b10 but with the\ninfinitesimal neighborhoods (in Y \u03b10 ) of a closed subscheme of it which is smooth over\nZp .\nAs a conclusion, using the above mentioned adaptation, we reobtain in a completely\nnew manner [dJ2, first main result]: even for p = 2 we can avoid entirely the use of [dJ2-3]\nin the proofs of the two Theorems of 3.15.1 (cf. their references to descent). Moreover,\n3) points out a weakening of the conditions (restrictions) in [dJ2, first main result]. We\nget:\nCorollary 2. In loc. cit. one can replace \"is locally of finite type over a field with a\nfinite p-basis\" by: is locally a pro-\u00e9tale (formal) scheme over a (formal) scheme of finite\ntype over a field with a finite p-basis.\nWarning: Corollary 2 is by no chance a trivial improvement. For instance, there are\npro-\u00e9tale schemes over a scheme of finite type over a field k0 with a finite p-basis, which\nhave closed subschemes of codimension 1 having no k0 -valued points.\n3.15.4. More on b) of the Fact of 3.6.19. We assume p \u2265 3. Let k be a perfect\nfield of characteristic p. Let X be a regular, formally smooth W (k)-scheme which locally\n387\n\n\fin the Zariski topology is a pro-\u00e9tale scheme over a smooth W (k)-scheme. Let X\u0302Y be the\ncompletion of X along a closed subscheme Y which is formally smooth over W (k). Let Z\nbe a pro-\u00e9tale, formal scheme over X\u0302Y ; locally Z is the completion of a pro-\u00e9tale scheme\nover a smooth W (k)-scheme along a closed subscheme of it which is formally smooth over\nW (k). Z \u2227 is the formal scheme obtained by completing Z p-adically (so, if Z = X\u0302Y ,\n\u2207\nthen Z \u2227 is the completion of X along Yk ). The category MF[0,1]\n(Z) (and so implicitly\n\u2207\np \u2212 MF[0,1](Z)) is defined as follows. We can restrict (via standard gluing arguments)\nto local charts, i.e. we can assume Z is the formal scheme defined by completing a pro\u00e9tale, affine scheme Spec(A) over a smooth, affine W (k)-scheme along a closed subscheme\nof it defined by an ideal IA of A such that Spec(A/IA ) is formally smooth over W (k).\nDenoting by \u00c2 the completion of A in the IA -topology, we take\n\u2207\n\u2207\nMF[0,1]\n(Spf(\u00c2)) := MF[0,1]\n(\u00c2).\n\u2207\n\u2207\nSo p \u2212 MF[0,1]\n(Spf(\u00c2)) = p \u2212 MF[0,1]\n(\u00c2). We have:\n\nCorollary. The category p \u2212 DG(Z \u2227 ) (resp. p \u2212 F F (Z \u2227 )) is antiequivalent (via the\n\u2207\n\u2207\nD functor) to p \u2212 MF[0,1]\n(Z) (resp. to MF[0,1]\n(Z)).\nProof: Starting from Corollary 2 of 3.15.3 6) and Grothendieck\u2013Messing theory\nof lifting p-divisible groups (see [Me, ch. 4-5]) the part referring to p-divisible groups\nfollows. The part referring to finite, flat, commutative group schemes of p-power rank,\nresults from its part referring to p-divisible groups, once we remark three things:\na) D is faithful (working in the faithfully flat topology, this is a consequence of\n3.6.18.5.3);\n\u2207\nb) any object (resp. morphism) of MF[0,1]\n(Z), locally in the N-pro-\u00e9tale topology\nof Z lifts to a p-divisible object (resp. to a morphism between two p-divisible objects)\n\u2207\nof MF[0,1]\n(Z): using Fact of 2.2.1.1 6) and the p \u2265 3 analogue of 3.14 B3, this is a\nconsequence of 3.6.18.4.2 (resp. of 3.6.18.5.4 1));\n\nc) Galois descent allows us to replace \"in the N-pro-\u00e9tale topology\" by \"in the Zariski\ntopology\" in b) (cf. a)).\nIn fact, using the equivalent of Corollary 1 of 3.15.3 3) over k, 3.6.18.5.3 and [BLR,\nth. 12 of p. 83], in b) we can work locally in the \u00e9tale topology, without \"appealing\" to\na p-divisible context.\n3.15.4.1. Variants. 3.15.4 and 3.6.18.5.8 can be combined. Similarly, if p = 2,\nthe variant of 3.6.18.5.7 pointed out in 3.14 B5, can be combined with Corollary 2 of\n3.15.3 6), to get a variant of 3.15.4 which disregards either all multiplicative type parts\nor all \u00e9tale parts. Also, 3.15.4 has a version in which k is replaced by any field having\na finite p-basis: [dJ2, 2.2.2-3] is the main ingredient needed to show that the category\n\u2207\nMF[0,1]\n(\u00c2) is well defined and does not depend on the choice of a Frobenius lift of \u00c2\u2227 ;\n\u2207\nsee also [dJ2, 2.3.4 and 2.4.8] for interpretations of p \u2212 MF[0,1]\n(\u00c2) in terms of suitable\n\n388\n\n\ffiltered F -crystals. Warning: in the case of a field having a p-basis, 3.15.4 b) has to be\nreplaced by the paragraph following 3.15.4 c).\n3.15.4.1.1. Some extensions to p-divisible contexts. For future references we\nalso point out the \"p-divisible\" form of 3.15.2 and of Corollary 1 of 3). We have:\nCorollary. We refer to 3.15.2 (resp. to Corollary 1 of 3)). The category p \u2212\n\u2207\nDG(Xk\u0303 ) (resp. p \u2212 DG(X\u0302Yk\u0303 )) is antiequivalent (via D) to p \u2212 MV[0,1]\n(X) (resp. to\n\u2207\n\u2227\np \u2212 MV[0,1] (XY )).\n3.15.5. Open questions. Let O be as in 2.2.1.4 and let (Y, U ) be as in 2.2.1.4.1.\nLet n \u2265 2, n \u2208 N. Let f : G1 \u2192 G2 be a morphism between truncations mod pn of two\np-divisible groups over YO/pO . In connection to 3.6.14.4.1, 2.2.1.4 and 3.15.2, we have\nthe following question.\nQ1. If f restricted to U is an isomorphism (resp. is a closed embedding), what extra\nconditions assure us that f is an isomorphism (resp. is a closed embedding)?\nWe now present an approach which we hope will lead to an answer to Q1. Following\nthe proof of 2.2.1.4 we can assume Y = Spec(W (k)[[T ]]), with k = k\u0304, and its Frobenius\nlift is defined (at the level of W (k)-algebras) via: T goes to T p . Using [Il, 4.8] we get that\nG1 and G2 lift to truncations mod pn of p-divisible groups over R := W (k)[[T ]]. So we\ncan apply 3.15.2 to f . We can write D(f ) as a morphism m12 between truncations mod\npn of two objects of p \u2212 M[0,1] (Y ); here we identify p \u2212 M[0,1] (Y ) with p \u2212 M\u2207\n[0,1] (Y )\n(cf. the logical non-filtered version of 3.6.18.5.1 and its p = 2 analogue). As n \u2265 2, often\nthe truncation mod p of m12 can be viewed as well as a morphism between two objects\nof MF[0,1](Y ). If this is so, then as in the proof of 2.2.1.4 we conclude that the induced\nmorphism f : G1 [p] \u2192 G2 [p] is an isomorphism (resp. is a closed embedding) and so\nusing Nakayama's lemma, we get that f is an isomorphism (resp. is a closed embedding).\nWe now assume Y \u2227 is equipped with a Frobenius lift and that O = W (k). For\nfuture references we also point out the following two general forms of Q1 which involve\n\"arbitrary\" p-divisible objects and for which the previous paragraph can be naturally\nadapted. Let y0 : Spec(k0 ) \u2192 Y be the maximal point of Y . Let C1 and C2 be two\nobjects of p \u2212 M[0,a] (Y ), with a \u2208 N. Let m : C1 /pn1 C1 \u2192 C2 /pn2 C2 be a morphism\nbetween two of their truncations; we view it as an OY -linear map between OY -sheaves\nendowed with Frobenius endomorphisms. Let iU be the inclusion of U in Y . We assume\nn2 \u2265 n1 \u2265 a + 1.\nQ2. If n1 = n2 and if i\u2217U (m) is an isomorphism (resp. an epimorphism), what extra\nconditions assure us that m is an isomorphism (resp. an epimorphism)?\nQ3. We assume the kernel of i\u2217U (m) is included in ph times the underlying OU sheaf of i\u2217U (C1 /pn1 C), with h \u2208 S(a + 2, n1 ). Under what conditions the underlying\nW (k0 )-module M0 of the kernel of y0\u2217 (m) is included in ph\u2212a\u22121 times the underlying\nW (k0 )-module M01 of y0\u2217 (C1 /pn1 C1 )?\n389\n\n\f3.15.6. Complements on the deformation theory in the generalized\nShimura context. In what follows we point out that 2.2.21 UP, 2.4, 3.2.4, a great\npart of 3.6 and 3.15.1 hold in the generalized Shimura context, provided we state everything in terms of (filtered) F -crystals. To avoid repetitions we refer to parts of 3.6 and\n3.11 even if p = 2, without mentioning each time that this is allowed by (different parts\nof) 3.14.\nWe start with a generalized Shimura p-divisible object C = (M, (F i(M ))i\u2208S(a,b) , \u03c6, G)\nof MF[a,b] (W (k)); let (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J be a family of tensors of T (M [ p1 ]) as in 2.2.9 3a). Let\n\u03bc : Gm \u2192 G be the canonical split cocharacter of C (see 2.2.1.2). Let N be the integral,\nclosed subgroup of G whose Lie algebra is the Lie algebra of Lie(G) on which Gm acts\nvia \u03bc (and inner conjugation) through the identical character. It is commutative and\nunipotent. Let R be the completion of N in the origin. We choose an isomorphism\nf \u0303 : R\u2192W\n \u0303 (k)[[x1 , ..., xd]], with d := dimW (k) (N ). Let \u03a6R be the Frobenius of R as in\n2.2.10. We consider the triple\nCR := (M \u2297W (k) R, (F i(M ) \u2297W (k) R)i\u2208S(a,b) , n(\u03c6 \u2297 1)),\nwith n \u2208 N (R) as the universal element. There is a unique connection \u2207 on CR (cf.\n3.6.18.7.1 b) and c); the rank of \u03a6R is 0). Let P\u22640 (resp. P\u22650 ) be the parabolic subgroup\nof G having W 0 (Lie(G), \u03c6) (resp. W0 (Lie(G), \u03c6)) as its Lie algebra. Let P<0 be the\nunipotent radical of P\u22640 .\nA. We first assume C is a Shimura-canonical lift in the sense of 3.11.6.1: to motivate\nwhat follows in D and E below and to first deal with shorter proofs, we treat till end of\nB the simplest case of such a C.\nFrom 3.11.6 B) and the Fact of 2.2.11.1 we get that N is a subgroup of P<0 . Moreover,\n\u2207 is of the form \u03b4 + \u03b2, with \u03b4 as the connection on M \u2297W (k) R annihilating M and with\n\u03b2 \u2208 Lie(P<0 ) \u2297W (k) \u03a9\u2227\nR/W (k) .\n\n(BET A)\n\n(BETA) is very much the same as [Fa2, rm. ii) after th. 10], being a property of \u03c3-Scrystals; it is a consequence of 3.6.18.7.1 b) and c).\nWe consider the triple\n0\nC\u22640\nR := (Lie(P\u22640 ) \u2297W (k) R, F (Lie(P\u22640 )) \u2297W (k) R, n(p\u03c6 \u2297 1)).\n\nIt is an object of p\u2212MF[0,1] (R). The generic fibre of the action (via inner conjugation) of\nP<0 on Lie(P\u22640 ) is faithful (this can be seen easily by looking at the restriction of ad(x),\nwith x \u2208 Lie(P<0 ), to the Lie algebra of a maximal torus of P\u22640 ). So \u2207 is integrable\nif the connection on C\u22640\nR it induces naturally (and with which it can be identified) is\nintegrable. So from 3.6.18.4.1 we get:\n\u2207\nCorollary. \u2207 is integrable and so (CR , \u2207) is a p-divisible object of MF[a,b]\n(R).\n\n390\n\n\fB. The Kodaira\u2013Spencer map of \u2207 is injective (this, as in [Va2, 5.4.8], is a consequence of the shape of N ). Let R1 := W (k)[[z1 , ..., zm]], with m \u2208 N, and let \u03a6R1 be\nits Frobenius lift taking zi into zip . We consider a p-divisible object (C1 , (t\u2032\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ) with\ntensors of MF[a,b] (R1 ) which under pull back via the Teichm\u00fcller lift z1 : Spec(W (k)) \u2192\nSpec(R1 ) is 1J -isomorphic (in the sense of 2.2.9 6)) to C; we view this 1J -isomorphism\nas an identification. We have:\nTheorem. There is a unique connection \u22071 on C1 . It is integrable, nilpotent mod\np and respects the G-action. Moreover, there is a uniquely determined W (k)-morphism\nzR : Spec(R1 ) \u2192 Spec(R) such that zR \u25e6z1 is the Teichm\u00fcller lift Spec(W (k)) \u2192 Spec(R)\n\u2217\nand (C1 , \u22071 , (t\u2032\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ) is isomorphic to zR\n(CR , \u2207, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ) through an isomorphism which\nin z1 is the mentioned identification.\nProof: 3.6.18.7.1 b) and c) imply the existence and the uniqueness of \u22071 as well\nas that \u22071 respects the G-action. The rest is entirely the same as the arguments of\n[Fa2, th. 10 and rm. iii) after it], as the Kodaira\u2013Spencer map of \u2207 is injective and\nd = dimW (k) (Lie(G)/F 0 (Lie(G))) (the essence of loc. cit. is captured by these two\nproperties and by Corollary of A). This ends the proof.\nC. We do not assume any more that (M, \u03c6, G) is Shimura-ordinary. As in 3.2.3\nwe deduce the existence of g \u2208 G(W (k)) such that (Lie(G), g\u03c6, F 0(Lie(G)), F 1 (Lie(G)))\nis of Borel type. From 3.11.6 B) we get that (M, (F i (M ))i\u2208S(a,b), g\u03c6, G) is a Shimuracanonical lift of (M, \u03c6, G). As above we construct CR . As 3.4-5 treat the generalized\nShimura context, from 3.4.6 we get that the slope \u22121 of (Lie(G), \u03c6) is at most equal to\nthe slope \u22121 of (Lie(G), g\u03c6). From 3.6.18.5.5 B we get that the pseudo-multiplicity of\n(Lie(G), h\u03c6) is the same as the multiplicity of the slope \u22121 of (Lie(G), h\u03c6), \u2200h \u2208 G(W (k))\n(cf. also 3.4.5.1 A and B).\nD. Theorem. In 3.6.18.7.3 C the word potentially can be dropped (i.e. M (C) and\nM (C/pn C) are moduli schemes of integrable connections).\nProof: We refer to the notations of 3.6.18.7.3. We can assume that R =\nW (k)[[x1 , ..., xm ]], with m \u2208 N and k = k\u0304, and that X = Spec(R). So in Proposition of\n3.6.18.7.3 A we have R1 = R = R\u2227 . From 3.6.18.7.1 b) and c) we get: any connection \u2207\non C which respects the GR -action is of the form \u03b4R + \u03b2, with \u03b2 \u2208 Lie(Gder ) \u2297R \u03a9\u0304R/W (k) .\nWe need to show: \u2207 is integrable.\nBased on C, the proof of 3.6.18.4.1 can be adapted to a great extend to the context\nof 3.6.18.7.3 C. Warning: there is one significant difference which does not allow us just\nto copy the mentioned proof. The obstacle to be overcome is:\nob) In 3.6.18.2 we had to deal only with integral slopes which made its proof very\nsimple. The slopes of (M, g\u03c6) (of C) are often \"far\" from being integral.\nThe overcome ob), we first pass to an adjoint context as follows. Due to the fact that\n\u03b4R is defined via the Zp -structure MZp of the last proof of 3.6.18.7.3 A, to show that \u2207\nis integrable it is enough to show that the connection on Lie(Gad\nR ) induced (as in 2.2.10)\n391\n\n\fby \u2207 is integrable. So we can assume that GR is adjoint and that the representation of\nGR on MR is the adjoint representation; so MR = Lie(GR ) and (a, b) = (\u22121, 1).\nGR is the pull back of an adjoint subgroup GZp of GL(MZp ). So Lie(GR ) =\nLie(GZp ) \u2297Zp R. Based on the Lemma of 3.6.18.7.3 A, we can assume there is a cocharacter \u03bcR : Gm \u2192 GR defining (as in 2.2.11 1)) the filtration (F i (Lie(GR ))i\u2208S(\u22121,1) of MR ;\neven more we can assume that \u03bcR is obtained from a cocharacter \u03bc of GW (k) by natural\npull back. So we can write \u03a6MR = gR (\u03c6 \u2297 1), where \u03c6 := \u03c3\u03bc( p1 ), with \u03c3 viewed as a\n\u03c3-linear automorphism of M := Lie(GW (k) ) fixing Lie(GZp ).\nBased on this expression of \u03a6MR and on C we can algebraize the things as in the\nproof of 3.4.18.6.1: so we \"connect\" C with a generic situation defined by a triple\nCR := (M \u2297W (k) R, (F i (M ))i\u2208S(\u22121,1) \u2297W (k) R, gR (g\u03c6 \u2297 1))\nwhich is an object of p\u2212MF[\u22121,1] (R). Here R is endowed with a Frobenius lift \u03a61R of multiplicative type (possible different from \u03a6U of 3.6.18.7.3), gR \u2208 GR (R) mod (x1 , ..., xm)\nis 1M , F i (M ) is the direct summand of M such that F i (MR ) = F i (M ) \u2297W (k) R, i = 0, 1,\nwhile g \u2208 GW (k) (W (k)) is (as in C) such that the Shimura adjoint Lie \u03c3-crystal (M, g\u03c6)\nis Shimura-ordinary. So the Theorem follows from the following Lemma.\nLemma. Any connection \u2207R on CR respecting the GR -action (i.e. of the form \u03b4+\u03b2,\nwith \u03b4 as in A and with \u03b2 \u2208 Lie(GR ) \u2297R \u03a9\u0304R/W (k) ) is integrable.\nProof: We can assume (M, g\u03c6) is cyclic (equivalently, that GZp is Zp -simple). As 3.4\nhandles the case of Cl(M, \u03c6, GW (k) ) as well, from 3.4.8 we get that the Newton polygons\nof pull backs of CR through geometric points of Spec(R/pR) all have the same Newton\npolygon and so are Shimura adjoint Lie F -crystals which are Shimura-ordinary; here\nthe pull backs are obtained via Teichm\u00fcller lifts. So based on this we can imitate the\narguments of B to overcome the obstacle ob).\nFor this we consider the \u03a61R -linear map \u03a8 : MR \u2192 MR obtained as \u03a8 of 3.4.5; we\ncall it the Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Hasse\u2013Witt shift of CR . Let N be the Zp -submodule of MR\nformed by elements fixed by \u03a8. N \u2297Zp R is a direct summand of M \u2297W (k) R, cf. [De3,\n1.2.4] and the above part on (constant) Newton polygons.\nIf GW (k) is not (resp. is) of Bn Lie type, let P\u0303\u22640 be the subgroup of GR (resp. of\nthe simply connected semisimple group cover Gsc\nR of GR ) normalizing N \u2297Zp R; we can\nview N \u2297Zp R as well as a Lie subalgebra of Lie(Gsc\nR ). Based on the Claim of 3.5.4 (for\np = 2, cf. also 3.14 C and J), by reasons of dimensions we get that for any Teichm\u00fcller lift\nT L : Spec(W (k1 )) \u2192 Spec(R), with k1 a perfect field containing k, the image of P\u0303\u22640W (k1 )\nin GW (k1 ) is the parabolic subgroup having W 0 (MR \u2297R W (k1 ), T L\u2217 (gR )(g\u03c6 \u2297 1)) as its\nLie algebra (it normalizes N \u2297Zp W (k1 ), cf. 2.2.3 3)); this justifies our notation with \u2264 0\nas a lower right index. So as in the proof of 3.6.18.7.3 A involving the adjoint context we\nget that P\u0303\u22640 is a parabolic subgroup of GR (resp. of Gsc\nR ). Let P\u22640 be the image of P\u0303\u22640\nin GR . pgR (g\u03c6 \u2297 1) takes Lie(P\u22640 ) onto itself.\nWe consider the intersection HR/pR of P\u22640R/pR with PR/pR . Its fibres are smooth,\nconnected and of same dimension: using the same type of pull backs as above, this follows\n392\n\n\feasily from 3.11.6 A and B (more precisely, the smoothness part follows from the fact\nthat the intersection P\u22640W (k1 ) \u2229 PW (k1 ) contains a maximal torus of GW (k1 ) ; see [SGA3,\nVol. III, 4.1.1-2 and 4.5 of Exp. XXVI]). So (as in the part of 3.6.18.7.3 A refering to\nNR/pR ) the group scheme HR/pR is smooth. As Hk contains a maximal torus of Gk ,\nfrom [SGA3, Vol. II, 3.6 of p. 48] we get HR/pR contains a maximal torus of GR/pR .\nFollowing the proof of Fact 2 of 2.2.9 3), we can assume (after suitable G(R)-conjugation)\nthat H := P\u22640 \u2229 P contains a maximal torus of GR and that \u03bcR factors through it. We\nget that the triple\n(Lie(P\u22640 ), F 0 (Lie(P\u22640 )), gR (g \u03c6\u0303 \u2297 1)),\nwith \u03c6\u0303 := p\u03c6, is an object of p\u2212MF[0,1] (R). As in A we get that \u03b2 \u2208 Lie(P\u22640 )\u2297R \u03a9\u0304R/W (k)\nand that \u2207R is integrable. This ends the proof of the Lemma and so of the Theorem.\nWarning. The way we got this Corollary does not apply to get that all connections\nof 3.6.18.7.1 c) are integrable. But we do expect that all such connections are integrable.\nE. D achieves the deformation theory in the generalized Shimura context. So many\nparts of 3.1-4 and 3.6.7-14 hold (occasionally under minor restatements) for the generalized Shimura context. In particular, we get:\nCorollary. B holds without assuming that (M, g\u03c6, G) is Shimura-ordinary.\nFor the sake of convenience, the part involving Newton polygons (i.e. pertaining to\n3.1.0, 3.2.4, etc.) is deferred to Appendix. Here we just point out that:\n\u2013 3.1.0 d), 3.7.6 and 3.12 remain valid in the generalized Shimura context (no change\nof arguments are needed);\n\u2013 3.6.1.2-3, 3.6.18.2-4 and 3.6.18.8 for the generalized Shimura context are already\n\"encompassed\" by 3.6.18.7.1 c), 3.6.18.7.3 C and D;\n\u2013 one can state forms of 3.6.18.5.1, 3.6.18.5.3 and of 3.6.18.5.7-8 for the generalized\nShimura context; as this context is not well suited from the point of view of morphisms,\nthese forms are not stated here: we just mention that they are a consequence of 3.6.18.7.1\nc), 3.6.18.7.3 C and D;\n\u2013 the inducing property of 3.6.18.5 still holds for the generalized Shimura context:\nwe just need to restate its c) part in terms of \u22121 slopes of attached Shimura adjoint Lie\n\u03c3-crystals;\n\u2013 Corollary is the natural extension of 2.2.21 UP;\n\u2013 all of 2.4 can be adapted for p \u2265 5 to the generalized Shimura context (we just\nneed to work \u2013cf. 2.2.13.4\u2013 with filtrations in the adjoint context and so involving the\nrange [\u22121, 1]); moreover, we have weaker versions of these adaptations for p \u2208 {2, 3} (to\nbe compared with 2.2.16.5 and 2.3.18.3).\n3.15.7. The boundedness principle. There is a widely spread opinion that pdivisible groups (and so by extrapolation p-divisible objects) involve an infinite process.\nThe Fundamental Lemma of 3.6.15 B points out that this opinion is not quite accurate.\nOur philosophy (already hinted at in 3.6.18.10) is:\n393\n\n\fPh. p-divisible objects involve a \"bounded infinite\" process.\nTill the end of 3.15.7 we formalize what we call the boundedness principle and so\n\"implicitly\" explain what we mean by a \"bounded infinite\" process. Different forms of it\nwill be indexed by numbers attached to BP .\nWe start with definitions meant to ease the statement of results. Till end of \u00a73 we\nwork with p \u2265 2 and with k a perfect field of characteristic p. In all that follows M is a\nfree W (k)-module of finite rank dM \u2208 N.\nA. Definitions. a) By an elementary Dieudonn\u00e9 (resp. elementary Dieudonn\u00e9\u2013\nFontaine) object of p \u2212 M(W (k)) we mean an object (M, \u03c6) for which there is a W (k)basis {e1 , ..., edM } of M such that \u03c6(ei ) = pni ei+1 , i = 1, dM , with edM +1 = e1 , ni = 0\nif i \u2208 S(1, dM \u2212 1), and ndM \u2208 Z is relatively prime to dM (resp. with edM +1 = e1 and\nni 's being either all non-negative or all non-positive, and which can not be written as a\ndirect sum of non-trivial p-divisible objects whose underlying W (k)-modules have such\nW (k)-basis). Such a W (k)-basis {e1 , ..., edM } is called a standard W (k)-basis of (M, \u03c6).\nAn object of p \u2212 M(W (k)) is called a Dieudonn\u00e9 (resp. Dieudonn\u00e9\u2013Fontaine) object if\nit is a direct sum of elementary Dieudonn\u00e9 (resp. of elementary Dieudonn\u00e9\u2013Fontaine)\nobjects of p \u2212 M(W (k)).\nb) By the Dieudonn\u00e9 volume (resp. torsion) of a latticed isocrystal C = (M, \u03c6) we\nmean the smallest number DV (C) \u2208 N \u222a {0} (resp. DT (C) \u2208 N \u222a {0}) such that there\nis an isogeny m : C1 \u0592\u2192 CW (k\u0304) (of latticed isocrystals), with C1 a Dieudonn\u00e9 object of\np \u2212 M(W (k\u0304)), defined at the level of W (k\u0304)-modules by a monomorphism m : M1 \u0592\u2192 M\nsuch that M/m(M1 ) has length DV (C) (resp. such that pDT (C) M \u2282 m(M1 )).\nc) Similarly to b) we define Dieudonn\u00e9\u2013Fontaine volume DF V (C) (resp. torsion\nDF T (C)) of C.\nPn\nd) We consider an n-tuple \u03c4 := (a1 , ..., an) formed by integers. If i=1 ai is nonnegative (resp. non-positive) then by the non-negative (resp. non-positive) sign deviation\nof \u03c4 we mean the maximum value of \u22121 (resp. of 1) times sums which are of the form\nP\ns\nand s \u2208 S(m, n + m \u2212 1), and which have the property that\ni=m ai , where m \u2208 S(1, n) P\ns\nall its subsums of the form P\ni=m1 ai , with m1 \u2208 S(m, s), are (warning!) non-positive\nn\n(resp. are non-negative). If\ni=1 ai is positive (resp. is negative), then by the sign\ndeviation\nSD(\u03c4\n)\nof\n\u03c4\nwe\nmean\nits\nnon-negative (resp. its non-positive) sign deviation. If\nPn\ni=1 ai = 0, then by the sign SD(\u03c4 ) of \u03c4 we mean the minimum between its non-negative\nand non-positive sign deviations.\nd') As in d) we define the (non-negative or the non-positive) value deviation V D(\u03c4 )\nof \u03c4 , by considering sums of different entries (not necessarily consecutive) of \u03c4 which have\nthe same sign.\nPq\ne) The entry aq of \u03c4 is called quasi-special, if the sum i=q+s ai has a sign which\ndoes not depend on s \u2208 S(\u2212n + 1, 0). If all these sums are negative (so also aq < 0), we\nrefer to aq as a special negative entry of \u03c4 . Similarly we define special positive entries of\n\u03c4 . By the negative (resp. positive) sp-invariant of \u03c4 we mean the number\nsp\u2212 (\u03c4 ) \u2208 N \u222a {0}\n394\n\n\f(resp. the number sp+ (\u03c4 ) \u2208 N \u222a {0}) of special negative (resp. of special positive) entries\nof \u03c4 .\nThe existence of DV (C) and so of DT (C) is equivalent to Dieudonn\u00e9's classification\nof isocrystals over k\u0304 and this explains our terminology. Obviously\nDF V (C) \u2264 DV (C)\nand\nDF T (C) \u2264 DT (C).\nExamples. SD(\u22121, 1, \u22121, \u22121, 1, 1, 0, \u22121) = 1 + 1 = 2, SD(1, 1, \u22122, 1, 3) = 2 and\nSD(\u22121, 1, \u22121) = 1. sp\u2212 (\u22121, 1, \u22121, \u22121, 1, 1, \u22121, 0, \u22121) = 2 (the special negative entries\nbeing the last two \u22121).\n3.6.15 B can be restated as:\nBP0. The isomorphism deviation of any \u03c3-S-crystal (M, \u03c6, G) over k is a finite\nnumber which is not bigger than 2DT (Lie(G), \u03c6) + 1 + sL (\u03c6), where sL (\u03c6) \u2208 N \u222a {0} is\nthe smallest number such that psL (\u03c6) \u03c6(Lie(G)) \u2282 Lie(G).\nB. Remarks. 0) It is an easy exercise to check that in the proof of 3.14.5 B we\ncan in fact use Dieudonn\u00e9\u2013Fontaine objects. So in BP0 we can replace DT (Lie(G), \u03c6)\nby DF T (Lie(G), \u03c6). This represents considerable improvements in practical calculations.\nFor instance, referring to a) of A, if (n1 , n1 , ..., ndM ) = (1, 1, ..., 1, \u22121), with dM \u2265 2, then\nDF T (C) = 1 while DT (C) = max{1, dM \u2212 2}. More generally, we have the following\nsequence of 3 inequalities\n(IN EQ)\n\nDF T (C) \u2264 SD(n1 , ..., ndM ) \u2264 V D(n1 , ..., ndM ) \u2264\n\ndM\nX\n\n|ni | .\n\ni=1\n\nThe second and the third inequality follow from very definitions.\nPn\nWe now check the first inequality in the case i=1 ni > 0 (the other cases are entirely\nthe same) and not all ni 's are non-negative. We consider\nPmthe biggest u \u2208 N such that\nthere is m \u2208 S(1, n) with the property that am\u2212v,m := i=m\u2212v ni \u2264 0, \u2200v \u2208 S(0, u); so\nnm+1 and nm\u2212u\u22121 are positive and nm \u2264 0. For v \u2208 S(0, u), we replace nm\u2212v by\np\u2212am\u2212v,m nm\u2212v .\nAs we are in a circular context, we can assume m \u2212 u = 1. If dM = u + 1 or if all\nni 's, with i \u2208 S(u + 2, ..., dM ), are non-negative we are done, as by very definitions all\n\u2212am\u2212v,m 's belong to S(0, SD(n1 , ..., ndM )). If this is not the case, we next deal with the\nremaining segment, formed by the integers nu+2 ,..., ndM . We repeat the operation. We\nchoose the biggest\nPm1 u1 \u2208 N such that there is m1 \u2208 S(u + 2, dM ) with the property that\nam1 \u2212v1 ,m1 := i=m\nni \u2264 0, \u2200v1 \u2208 S(0, u1 ); so nm1 +1 and nm1 \u2212u1 \u22121 are positive and\n1 \u2212v1\nnm1 \u2264 0. Due to the choice of u (of being the biggest), we have m1 \u2212 u1 \u2265 u + 2. For\n395\n\n\fv1 \u2208 S(0, u1 ), we replace nm1 \u2212v1 by p\u2212am1 \u2212v1 ,m1 nm1 \u2212v1 and we repeat the operation.\nSo by induction on the number of remaining entries (they do not need to be indexed by\na set of consecutive numbers of S(1, dM )), we get that the first inequality holds.\nIn particular, if ni \u2208 S(\u22121, 1), \u2200i \u2208 S(1, n), then (as a substitute of (INEQ)) it is\nconvenient to work with the inequality\n(CON V IN EQ)\n\nDF T (C) \u2264 min{n\u2212 , n+ },\n\nwhere n\u2212 (resp. n+ ) is the number of i's such that ni = \u22121 (resp. such that ni = 1).\nHowever, for being quicker (as the goal below is not to be sharp), for the general estimates\nof C below we still work with DT 's instead of DF T 's.\n1) The union of the categories p \u2212 M[0,a] (W (k)), a \u2208 N, is a full subcategory of the\ncategory of \u03c3-crystals over k but is not equal to it. However, 3.6.15 B and BP0 can be\nentirely adapted to the context where we work with triples (M, \u03c6, G), where (M, \u03c6) is a\nlatticed isocrystal and G is an arbitrary integral subgroup of GL(M ) such that Lie(GB(k) )\nis normalized by \u03c6. Argument: using dilatations as in 3.9.9 B and C, we replace the closed\nsubgroup G of GL(M ) by a homomorphism G1 \u2192 GL(M ) factoring through G, with G1\na smooth group scheme over W (k) having the same generic fibre as G; as there is s \u2208 N\nsuch that ps (Lie(GB(k) ) \u2229 End(M )) \u2282 Lie(G1 ), we can proceed as in the proof of 3.6.15\nB to show (by working with the triple (M, \u03c6, G1 )) that the isomorphism deviation of\n(M, \u03c6, G) is still a finite number. In particular, this applies to latticed isocrystals over k.\nAlso one can similarly check that the extra condition of 3.16.6 B pertaining to the\nW -condition is not needed.\n2) We refer to the proof of 3.6.15 B. In practice it is more convenient to work with\nthe following estimate\n(CON V EST )\n\nn \u2212 m \u2265 max{m + 1 + sL (\u03c6), n(C1 ), ..., n(Cs)}\n\ninstead of (EST) of the mentioned place. The reason is: for such an n, \u03c6(h\u03031 ) \u2208 End(M ),\nprovided we have all ul 's greater than n \u2212 m. This has a version in the context of\nDieudonn\u00e9\u2013Fontaine objects (cf. 0)).\n3) We refer to 3.6.16 2). We think it is an interesting problem to compute isom \u2212\nd(M, \u03c6, G) (or at least to get sharp estimates of it) perhaps in terms of Hodge numbers\nof (M, \u03c6s ) and (or) of (Lie(G), \u03c6s ), s \u2208 N. We do not think (EST) of 3.6.15 B is a very\nsharp estimate (for instance, for the case of the \u03c3-crystal of a supersingular elliptic curve\nwe get n \u2265 4 and not n \u2265 1); however, we do not think it can be significantly improved\n(in general). The same applies to the context of principal bilinear quasi-polarizations.\n4) As in 2.2.22.1, we define additively the negative and the positive sp-invariant of\nany cyclic diagonalizable object of p \u2212 MF (W (k)) and of the object of p \u2212 M(W (k))\ndefined by it by forgetting the filtration.\nC. Estimates. Let (M, \u03c6) be a latticed isocrystal over k. We want to estimate\nDT (M, \u03c6). We can assume k = k\u0304. Let SL be the set of slopes of (M [ p1 ], \u03c6). For \u03b1 \u2208 SL,\nwe write\na\u03b1\n,\n\u03b1=\nb\u03b1\n396\n\n\fwith a\u03b1 , b\u03b1 \u2208 Z, b\u03b1 > 0 and (a\u03b1 , b\u03b1 ) = 1; let m\u03b1 \u2208 N be such that the multiplicity of the\nslope \u03b1 is m\u03b1 b\u03b1 . Let\ns \u2208 N \u222a {0}\nbe the smallest number such that \u03c6(ps M ) \u2282 M . We refer to it as the s-number of (M, \u03c6).\nLet d := l.c.m.{b\u03b1 |\u03b1 \u2208 SL}. Let \u03b1max \u2208 N \u222a {0} (resp. e \u2208 N) be the maximum of all\nsb\u03b1 + a\u03b1 's (resp. of all m\u03b1 b\u03b1 's). Using 2.2.3 3) we get a natural monomorphism\nqSL : \u2295\u03b1\u2208SL W (\u03b1)(M, \u03c6) \u0592\u2192 M.\nLet\nh \u2208 N \u222a {0}\n(resp. h\u03b1 \u2208 N\u222a{0}) be the greatest Hodge number of (M, ps \u03c6) (resp. of (W (\u03b1)(M, \u03c6), ps\u03c6)).\nLet\nh\u0303 := max{h\u03b1 |\u03b1 \u2208 SL}.\nWe refer to h\u0303 (resp. to h) as the small h-number (resp. as the h-number) of (M, \u03c6). We\nhave\nh\u0303 \u2264 h\nand the equality holds if qSL is an isomorphism; this motivates the use of the word small.\nBP1. For any triple (a, b, c) \u2208 N \u00d7 N \u222a {0} \u00d7 N \u222a {0}, there is a smallest number\nn(a, b, c) \u2208 N \u222a {0}\nsuch that DT (C) \u2264 n(a, b, c), for any latticed isocrystal C over k of rank a, s-number b\nand h-number c. In particular, DT (M, g\u03c6) \u2264 n(dM , s, h), \u2200g \u2208 GL(M ).\nProof: We use induction on a: the case a = 1 is trivial. We work in the context of\n(M, \u03c6). We have\n(EST 1)\n\nDT (M, \u03c6) \u2264 es + DT (M, ps \u03c6).\n\nArgument: if N is a W (k)-submodule of M such that the pair (N, ps \u03c6) is an elementary\nDieudonn\u00e9 object of p \u2212 M(W (k)) and if {b1 , ..., bn} is a standard W (k)-basis of (N, ps \u03c6),\nthen the pair (< pns b1 , pns\u2212s b2 , ..., psbn\u22121 , bn >, \u03c6) is an elementary Dieudonn\u00e9 object of\np \u2212 M(W (k)); so we just have to remark that n \u2264 e.\nSo from now on (till the Fact below inclusive) we assume s = 0.\nWe first consider the case when |SL| = 1 and m\u03b1 = 1. We consider a B(k)-basis\n{e1 , ..., eb\u03b1 } of M [ p1 ] formed by elements of M and such that \u03c6(ei ) = ei+1 , i = 1, b\u03b1\u22121 ,\nand \u03c6(eb\u03b1 ) = pa\u03b1 e1 . We also assume e1 \u2208 M \\ pM . Let t \u2208 S(0, b\u03b1 \u2212 1). Let e0 :=\n\u03c6\u22121 (e1 ) \u2208 M [ p1 ].\n397\n\n\fClaim. There is an increasing sequence (ct )t\u2208S(0,b\u03b1 \u22121) of elements of N which depends only on \u03b1 and h\u03b1 and such that\n\u03c6(et ) \u2208\n/\n\n(EST 2)\n\nt\nX\n\nW (k)ei + pct M,\n\ni=1\n\n\u2200t \u2208 S(0, b\u03b1 \u2212 1).\nTo check the Claim, we use a second induction on t \u2208 S(0, b\u03b1 \u2212 1). Taking c0 := 1,\n(EST2) holds for t = 0. We assume now that (EST2) holds for t \u2264 r \u2212 1 \u2208 S(0, b\u03b1 \u2212 2).\nAs c0 \u2264 c1 \u2264 ... \u2264 cr\u22121 and as \u03c6(er\u22121 ) = er , we have\n(IN D)\n\n1 \u0001\npcr\u22121 \u22121 M \u2229 (< e1 , ..., er > [ ]) \u2282< e1 , ..., er > .\np\n\nWe now prove that (EST2) holds for t = r. We write\n(EQ)\n\n\u03c6(er ) =\n\nr\nX\n\nai ei + pnr x,\n\ni=1\n\nwith x \u2208 M \\ pM and all ai 's in W (k). By our initial induction (on ranks), we can speak\nabout n(t, 0, h\u03b1 ). So let\n(RECEQ)\n\u0001\ncr := cr\u22121 +b\u03b1 (h\u03b1 +cr\u22121 )+2rb\u03b1 !(h\u03b1 +cr\u22121 )2 1+2max{n(r, 0, j)|j \u2208 S(0, h\u03b1 +cr\u22121 \u22121)} .\n\nPr\u22121\nWe assume nr \u2265 cr + 1. As \u03c6(er \u2212 i=1 \u03c3 \u22121 (ai+1 )ei ) = pnr x + a1 e1 , from (IND) we\nget that a1 is not divisible by ph\u03b1 +cr\u22121 . We consider the Frobenius\nPr endomorphism \u03c6r of\nMr that takes ei into ei+1 if i \u2264 r \u2212 1 and which takes er into i=1 ai ei . As a1 6= 0, by\ninverting p, \u03c6r becomes an isomorphism. So (Mr , \u03c6r ) is a \u03c3-crystal whose h-number is\nthe p-adic valuation of a1 and so it is at most h\u03b1 + cr\u22121 . Let\nq := 1 + 2r(b\u03b1 \u2212 1)!(h\u03b1 + cr\u22121 )max{n(t, 0, j)|j \u2208 S(0, h\u03b1 + cr\u22121 \u2212 1)}.\nBy the very definition of n(r, 0, j), we know that\n(IN D0 )\n\nDT (Mr , \u03c6r ) \u2264\n\nq\u22121\n.\n2r(b\u03b1 \u2212 1)!(h\u03b1 + cr\u22121 )\n\nLet Nr be a W (k)-submodule of Mr such that Mr /Nr is annihilated by pDT (Mr ,\u03c6r )\nand (Nr , \u03c6r ) is a Dieudonn\u00e9 object of p \u2212 M(W (k)). Writing (Nr , \u03c6r ) as a direct sum\nof elementary Dieudonn\u00e9 objects of p \u2212 M(W (k)), we choose a simple factor (Nr1 , \u03c6r ) of\nit such that the component e11 of pDT (Mr ,\u03c6r ) e1 in Nr1 (w.r.t. to the resulting direct sum\ndecomposition of Nr ) is not divisible inside Nr1 by p1+DT (Mr ,\u03c6r ) .\n398\n\n\f\u03b1\nFrom (EQ) we get that pqa\u03b1 e1 = \u03c6b\u03b1 q (e1 ) taken mod pnr is congruent to \u03c6qb\nr (e1 ).\n1\nqa\u03b1 1\n\u03b1\nSo (cf. also (IND)) \u03c6qb\ne1 \u2208 pnr \u2212cr\u22121 \u2212DT (Mr ,\u03c6r ) Nr1 .\nr (e1 ) \u2212 p\nOn the other hand, as (Nr1 , \u03c6r ) is an elementary Dieudonn\u00e9 object of p \u2212 M(W (k)),\n1\nnr\n\u03b1\n\u03c6qb\nis divisible inside Nr1 by pmr , where\nr (e1 ) mod p\n(0)\nmr \u2208 (N\u222a{0})\u2229[qb\u03b1 u\u2212DT (Mr , \u03c6r )\u2212r(h\u03b1 +cr\u22121 \u22121), qb\u03b1 u+DT (Mr , \u03c6r )+r(h\u03b1 +cr\u22121 \u22121)],\n\nwith u \u2208 [0, h\u03b1 + cr\u22121 \u2212 1] as the slope of (Nr1 , \u03c6r ); so vu \u2208 N \u222a {0} for some v \u2208 S(1, r!).\nAs nr \u2265 cr + 1, it is easy to see that nr \u2212 cr\u22121 \u2212 DT (Mr , \u03c6r ) is greater than\nqb\u03b1 u + DT (Mr , \u03c6r ) + r(h\u03b1 + cr\u22121 \u2212 1) as well as than qh\u03b1 (and so then qa\u03b1 ). From this,\n(IN D0 ) and the last two paragraphs we get:\n|qa\u03b1 \u2212 qb\u03b1 u| \u2264\n\nq\u22121\n+ r(h\u03b1 + cr\u22121 \u2212 1).\n2r(b\u03b1 \u2212 1)!(h\u03b1 + cr\u22121 )\n\nA simple computation shows that |\u03b1 \u2212 u| < b1\u03b1 ! . On the other hand, as r \u2264 b\u03b1 \u2212 1, from\nthe existence of v we get b\u03b1 ! |\u03b1 \u2212 u| \u2208 N \u222a {0}. We conclude: \u03b1 = u. So b\u03b1 divides a\u03b1\nand so b\u03b1 = 1. For b\u03b1 = 1 we have r = 0 and this contradicts the inequality r \u2265 1. So\nnr \u2264 cr . As obviously cr depends only on \u03b1, h\u03b1 and cr\u22121 , this ends the argument for the\nClaim. We conclude:\nCorollary. There is d(\u03b1, h\u03b1 ) \u2208 N depending only on \u03b1 and h\u03b1 and such that\nDT (M, \u03c6) \u2264 d(\u03b1, h\u03b1 ).\nNext we consider the case when |SL| = 1 and m\u03b1 is arbitrary. By induction on\nm\u03b1 \u2208 N we show that\n(EST 3)\n\nDT (M, \u03c6) \u2264 (2m\u03b1 \u2212 1)d(\u03b1, h\u03b1 ).\n\nUsing a short exact sequence 0 \u2192 (M1 , \u03c61 ) \u0592\u2192 (M, \u03c6) \u0589 (M2 , \u03c62 ) \u2192 0, with\ndimW (k) (M2 ) = b\u03b1 , we just need to remark the following 2 things:\na) The h-number of (Mi , \u03c6i ) is at most the same as the h-number of (M, \u03c6), i \u2208\nS(1, 2) (for i = 1 this is obvious while for i = 2 this follows by passing to duals of latticed\nisocrystals).\nb) Any isogeny from an elementary Dieudonn\u00e9 object (M0 , \u03c60 ) of p \u2212 M(W (k)) to\n(M2 , \u03c62 ) factors, after multiplication with p2(m\u03b1 \u22121)d(\u03b1,h\u03b1 ) , through (M, \u03c6).\nTo check b), let m0 \u2208 M0 be such that \u03c6b0\u03b1 (m0 ) = pa\u03b1 (m0 ) and M0 is W (k)generated by m0 , \u03c60 (m0 ),..., \u03c60b\u03b1 \u22121 (m0 ). Let m \u2208 M be such that via the W (k)epimorphism M \u0589 M2 is mapped into m0 ; here we view M0 as a W (k)-submodule\nof M2 . We have \u03c6b\u03b1 (m) = p\u03b1 m + m\u0303, with m\u0303 \u2208 M1 . We need to show that, eventually after multiplication with p2(m\u03b1 \u22121)d(\u03b1,h\u03b1 ) , we can choose m such that m\u0303 = 0. Using\ninduction on m\u03b1 , this boils down to the following obvious thing:\nFact. For any x \u2208 pa\u03b1 M0 , the equation \u03c6b0\u03b1 (y) = pa\u03b1 y + x has a solution y \u2208 M0 .\n399\n\n\fWe come back to an arbitrary latticed isocrystal (M, \u03c6); so we do not assume anymore that s = 0. Let\nu := max{(2ms+\u03b1 \u2212 1)d(s + \u03b1, h\u03b1 )|\u03b1 \u2208 SL}.\nExercise. Show that the cokernel of qSL is annihilated by p2dM \u03b1max du+u .\nHint. Let N be a W (k)-submodule of M such that (N, ps \u03c6) is a Dieudonn\u00e9 object\nof p \u2212 M(W (k)) and M \u2229 N0 [ p1 ]/N0 is annihilated by pu , for any elementary Dieudonn\u00e9\nobject of p \u2212 M(W (k)) which is a simple factor of (N, ps \u03c6). If the statement of the\nExercise is not true then there is y \u2208 M such that p2dM \u03b1max du+u+v y \u2208 N \\ pN for some\nv \u2208 N. Using standard W (k)-bases of all such (N0 , ps \u03c6)'s, procede by induction on\nthe number N R of non-zero coefficients of p2dM \u03b1max du+u+v y w.r.t. the W (k)-basis of N\nobtained by the union of all these standard W (k)-bases (for this induction replace 2dM\nby 2N R).\nFrom Exercise, (EST3), (EST1) and Corollary we get:\n(T OT ALEST )\n\nDT (M, \u03c6) \u2264 2dM \u03b1max du + se + 2u.\n\nSo BP1 is a consequence of (TOTALEST); for the part pertaining to g \u2208 GL(M )(W (k)),\nwe need to point out that such g's do not change the s-numbers or the h-numbers, while\nm\u03b1 's, d and e have upper bounds which depend only on dM and h. This ends the proof\nof BP1.\nBP2. We assume k = k\u0304. Let a, b \u2208 Z, b \u2265 a. Let r \u2208 N. Then there is a smallest\nnumber\nf (r, a, b) \u2208 N \u222a {0}\nsuch that the isomorphism class (and so also the Newton polygon) of any \u03c3-S-crystal\n(M, \u03c6, G) over k whose underlying module is of rank at most r and such that (M, \u03c6)\nis an object of p \u2212 M[a,b] (W (k)), depends only on its Fontaine truncation mod pf (r,a,b) .\nSimilarly, if a \u2265 0 then there is a smallest number\nf \u2032 (r, a, b) \u2208 N \u222a {0}\nsuch that the isomorphism class of (M, \u03c6, G) depends only on its weak truncation mod\n\u2032\npf (r,a,b) .\nThis is a consequence of BP0 and BP1; as a gross estimate we have:\nf \u2032 (r, a, b) \u2264 1 + b \u2212 a + 2g(r 2 , b \u2212 a, 2(b \u2212 a)),\nwhere for (a1 , b1 , c1 ) \u2208 N \u00d7 N \u222a {0} \u00d7 N \u222a {0},\ng(a1 , b1 , c1 ) := max{n(j, s, h)|(j, s, h) \u2208 S(1, a1 ) \u00d7 S(0, b1 ) \u00d7 S(0, c1 )}.\n400\n\n\fThe connection between these f 's and f \u2032 's is given (with a \u2265 0) by the inequalities\n(W F T RU N C)\n\nf \u2032 (r, a, b) \u2264 f (r, a, b) + b + 1 \u2264 f \u2032 (r, a, b) + b + 1;\n\nthe factor b+1 is added here as the Fontaine truncation mod pf (r,a,b) of (M, \u03c6, G) involves\ndivision of elements of the form \u03c6(x) by pc , with c \u2208 S(a, b); here x \u2208 M .\nBP2'.

By a global deformation of an object C of p \u2212\nM[a,b] (W (k)) (resp. of p \u2212 MF[a,b] (W (k))) we mean a pair (X, CX ), with X a W (k)scheme which locally in the Zariski topology is a pro-\u00e9tale scheme over a smooth W (k)scheme and which has a special fibre which is a geometrically connected, AG k-scheme,\n\u2207\nand with CX an object of p \u2212 M\u2207\n[a,b] (X) (resp. of p \u2212 MF[a,b] (X)), such that the pull\nback of CX via a k-valued (resp. W (k)-valued) point of X \u2227 is C. For our conventions on\ngroupoids we refer to 2.2.4 F.\nBP3. We consider a global deformation (X, CX ) of an object of p \u2212 M[a,b] (W (k)).\nLet r be the local rank of its underlying OX \u2227 -module.\na) If the number of isomorphism classes of Fontaine truncations mod pf (r,a,b) of pull\nbacks of CX through points of Xk with values in an arbitrary algebraically closed field\nk1 containing k is finite and does not depend on the choice of k1 , then the number of\nisomorphism classes of pull backs of CX through k1 -valued points of Xk is as well finite\nand does not depend on k1 .\nb) In general, there is a k-groupoid Yk on Xk such that the morphism mk : Yk \u2192\nXk \u00d7 Xk which is part of its definition is affine and of finite presentation and the pull\nbacks of CX through two k1 -valued points y1 and y2 of Xk are isomorphic iff the k1 -valued\nof Xk \u00d7k Xk defined by the pair (y1 , y2 ) lifts to mk .\nProof: a) follows from BP2. To see b), we can assume a \u2265 0. We consider the pull\nbacks of C to X \u00d7W (k) X via the two projections on X and the reduced Xk \u00d7k Xk -scheme\n\u2032\nYf \u2032 (r,a,b) parameterizing isomorphisms between their weak truncations mod pf (r,a,b) .\n\u2032\n\nThe construction of Yf \u2032 (r,a,b) is standard. As we work mod pf (r,a,b) , localizing and\nusing pull back arguments we can assume X is affine and of finite type over W (k). Even\nmore, we can assume XWf \u2032 (r,a,b) (k) is Wf \u2032 (r,a,b) (R/pR), with R a smooth W (k)-algebra\n(this is as in 3.15.3 6)); so we can use arguments at the level of (suitable conjugacy classes)\n401\n\n\fof matrices of Mr (Wf \u2032 (r,a,b) (R/pR)) to get the existence of Yf \u2032 (r,a,b) . Here suitable refers\nto the fact that we need to conjugate with invertible matrices which have a shape similar\nto the shape of h of 3.13.7.8. BP2 implies: we can take Yk = Yf \u2032 (r,a,b) . This ends the\nproof.\nE. Remark. We have a variant of BP3 in the relative context of 3.6.18.7.1 b): we\njust need to replace isomorphisms by inner isomorphisms. This is so as the part of the\nproof of D pertaining to matrices can be performed in the context of (suitable conjugacy\nclasses) of matrices defined by suitable Wf \u2032 (r,\u00e3,b\u0303) (k)-valued points of a (fixed) smooth\nsubgroup of a GL-group (over an open subscheme of XWf \u2032 (r,\u00e3,b\u0303) (k) ).\nF. The case of Shimura p-divisible groups. We consider a Shimura p-divisible\ngroup (DX , (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ) over X \u2227 , with X a regular, formally smooth W (k)-scheme having\na connected special fibre. Let r \u2208 N \u222a {0} be the rank of DX . Let E(DX ) be the object\nof p \u2212 M[0,1] (X) obtained by forgetting the filtration of D(DX ). As Xk is connected, we\nspeak (as in 2.2.9 6)) about 1J -isomorphism classes of pull backs of (\u2217(DX ), (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ),\nwith \u2217 \u2208 {D, E}, via geometric points of Xk (cf. also 3.6.18.7.3 A and 3.15.6 B). So we\nhave the following particular combination of D and E:\nBP4. There is a k-groupoid Yk on Xk such that the Xk \u00d7k Xk -scheme Yk is affine\nand of finite presentation and the pull backs of (E(DX ), (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ) through two geometric\npoints y1 and y2 of Xk with values in the same algebraically closed field k1 are isomorphic\niff the point of Xk \u00d7k Xk defined by the pair (y1 , y2 ) lifts to a k1 -valued point of Y .\nThis is entirely the same as the proof of D: we just need to remark that we can define\n\u2032\nYk using as well schemes of isomorphisms of truncations mod pf (r,0,1) of the pull backs\nof DXk to Xk \u00d7k Xk via the natural two projections of Xk \u00d7k Xk on Xk .\nG. Some invariants. Let q \u2208 N. Let (M, (F i (M ))i\u2208S(a,b), \u03c6, G) be a filtered \u03c3Fpq S-crystal over Fpq . So (M, \u03c6) is an object of p\u2212M[a,b] (W (Fpq )). We assume the existence\nof a family of tensors (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J in F 0 (T (M [ p1 ]) \u2297B(Fpq ) B(F)) such that \u03c6 \u2297 1(t\u03b1 ) = t\u03b1 ,\n\u2200\u03b1 \u2208 J , and GB(F) is the subgroup of GL(M \u2297W (Fpq ) B(F)) fixing t\u03b1 , \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 J . See\n2.2.22 2) for the meaning of Cl(M, \u03c6, G). The number of isomorphism classes of Fontaine\ntruncations mod pn of \u03c3Fpq -S-crystals over Fpq of the form (M, g\u03c6, G), with g \u2208 W (Fpq ),\nis at most |G(Wn (Fpq ))| and so it is finite (here n \u2208 N). We have:\nBP5. We assume k = k\u0304. The subset\nClq (M \u2297W (Fpq ) W (k), \u03c6 \u2297 1, GW (k) , (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J )\nof Cl(M \u2297W (Fpq ) W (k), \u03c6 \u2297 1, GW (k) , (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ) formed by inner isomorphism classes defined by \u03c3k -S-crystals with an emphasized family of tensors which are definable over Fpq\nis finite and its number of elements does not depend on k.\nProof: Let g \u2208 G(W (k)). As in 2.2.9 8) we construct a triple (MZp , GZp , (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J )\nstarting from (M \u2297W (Fpq ) W (k), g(\u03c6 \u2297 1), GW (k) , (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ). As GFp is connected, from\nLang's theorem we get that this triple does not depend on g; moreover, its extension to\n402\n\n\fW (F) is 1J -isomorphic to (M \u2297W (Fpq ) W (k), GW (k) , (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ). So BP5 follows from BP2\nand the finiteness of the set GZp (Wf \u2032 (dM ,a,b) (Fpq )) (the \"indepence of k is obvious; see\nalso b) of 2.2.4 B).\nFrom BP5, the First Main Corollary of 1.6.4 follows. We refer to the numbers D(r, d, q) of 1.6.4 as the classical Dieudonn\u00e9 numbers. Similarly, we refer to\nClq (M \u2297W (Fpq ) W (k), \u03c6\u22971, GW (k), (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ) as the level-q Dieudonn\u00e9 set of Cl(M \u2297W (Fpq )\nW (k), \u03c6 \u2297 1, GW (k), (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ). Its number of elements is referred as the level-q Dieudonn\u00e9\nnumber of Cl(M \u2297W (Fpq ) W (k), \u03c6 \u2297 1, GW (k) , (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ) and is denoted by\nDq (Cl(M \u2297W (Fpq ) W (k), \u03c6 \u2297 1, GW (k) , (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J )).\nAs a very gross (though morally useful) estimate we have\n(GREST )\n\u2032\nDq (Cl(M \u2297W (Fpq ) W (k), \u03c6 \u2297 1, GW (k), (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J )) \u2264 pq dimW (k) (G)(f (dM ,a,b)\u22121) GZp (Fpq ) ;\nthe right hand side of (GREST) is GZp (Wf \u2032 (dM ,a,b) (Fpq )) . In particular, in the context\nof p-divisible groups we get\n(GREST P \u2212 DIV )\n\nD(r, d, q) \u2264 pqr\n\n2\n\n(f \u2032 (r,1,0)\u22121)\n\n|GLr (Fpq )| \u2264 pqr\n\n2\n\nf \u2032 (r,1,0)\n\n.\n\nH. isom-constant deformations. The deformation (resp. the Shimura p-divisible\ngroup) of BP3 (resp. of BP4) is called isom-constant, if the k-morphism Yk \u2192 Xk \u00d7 Xk\nis surjective.\nProblem. Given a Shimura p-divisible group over W (k), construct explicitly (following the pattern of 3.6.11) global deformations of it which are isom-constant and uni\nplus quasi-versal.\nExample. We consider a cyclic diagonalizable Shimura filtered \u03c3-crystal (M, F 1 , \u03c6\u03031 , G).\nWe use the notations of 3.13.7.6.3.1 but we do not assume (M, \u03c6\u03031 , G) is quasi-final. So\nk = k\u0304. We assume there is a cycle (\u03b11 , ..., \u03b1s) of \u03c0 such that us = \u22121 is a negative\nspecial entry of (u1 , ..., us). Let Ui be the Ga subgroup of G having g\u03b1i as its Lie algebra,\ni \u2208 S(1, s). Let N U be the integral, closed subgroup of G generated by Gi 's; it is included\nin the unipotent radical of the parabolic subgroup of G having W 0 (Lie(G), \u03c6\u03031 ) as its Lie\nalgebra. We write Us = Spec(W (k)[t]) and we work with the Frobenius lift of W (k)[[t]]\nwhich maps t into tp . We consider the p-divisible object\nMUs := (M \u2297W (k) W (k)[t], F 1 \u2297W (k) W (k)[t], u(\u03c6\u03031 \u2297 1), (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J )\nof MF[0,1] (Us ), with u as the universal element of G(Us ) = G(W (k)[t]). We apply\n3.6.18.6 to it. We deduce the existence of an N-pro-\u00e9tale morphism \u0168 \u2192 Us such that:\n1) the special fibre of \u0168 is connected, has an image in Us k which is open and has a\nunique k-valued point mapping into the origin of Us k ;\n403\n\n\f\u2207\n2) the pull back M\u0168 of MUs to \u0168 \u2227 is a p-divisible object of MF[0,1]\n(\u0168 \u2227 ).\n\nAs us = \u22121, we can assume the Kodaira\u2013Spencer map naturally associated to M\u0168\nis injective in each k-valued point of \u0168k . The pull back of M\u0168 through such a point,\nwhen viewed without filtration, is a Shimura \u03c3k -crystal of the form (cf. the existence\nof Teichm\u00fcller lifts) (M, h1 \u03c6\u03031 , G), with h1 \u2208 Us (W (k)). It is easy to see that it is\nisomorphic to (M, \u03c6\u03031 , G), under an isomorphism defined by an element of N U (W (k)):\nas us is a negative special entry we can apply entirely the stairs method of the proof\nof 3.6.15 B. More precisely, the case s = 1 is trivial and if s \u2265 2 then by induction on\nj \u2208 N we replace hj \u03c6\u03031 by its (inner) conjugate hj+1 \u03c6\u03031 under an element (it is uniquely\ndetermined) of Us\u2212j (W (k)), where hj+1 is a W (k)-valued point of Us\u2212j ; here the indices\nof Ui 's are taken mod s. We get: \u2200m \u2208 N, h1+sm is congruent mod pm to 1M . So (cf.\nBP4):\nCorollary. (M\u0168 , (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ) is an isom-constant deformation of (M, \u03c6\u03031 , G) whose\nKodaira\u2013Spencer maps in k-valued points (resp. in the k-valued point of 1) are injective\n(resp. can be identified naturally with Lie(Us )/pLie(Us )).\nRemarks. 1) This example is the generalization of the well known classical case\nwhen s = 1 and us = \u22121. The simplest case of general nature covered by this example\nis: the case when all ui 's are non-positive and us = \u22121.\n2) The condition that (M, \u03c6\u03031 , G) is cyclic diagonalizable can be significantly weaken\n(we just need to get a \"circular property\" on the Lie algebras of Ga subgroups Ui 's of\nG as above); in particular, this always applies if the Lie stable p-rank of the Shimura\nadjoint Lie \u03c3-crystal attached to (M, \u03c6\u03031 , G) is positive (cf. 1) and 3.4.5.1 B).\nI. Minimal degrees of definition. We take k arbitrary. By a particular object\n(with tensors) of p\u2212M(W (k)) we mean a non-zero object C (with tensors) of p\u2212M(W (k))\nwhose extension Ck\u0304 to k\u0304 is definable over a finite field. For instance:\n\u2013 any cyclic diagonalizable Shimura \u03c3-crystal is particular (cf. 2.2.16.4 a));\n\u2013 if k \u2282 F then all objects (with tensors) of p \u2212 M(W (k)) are particular (this follows\nfrom the proof of BP5).\nBy the minimal degree of definition of a particular object C (with tensors) of p \u2212\nM(W (k)) we mean the smallest q \u2208 N such that Ck\u0304 is definable over Fpq . Lemma of\n3.11.8 implies that the minimal degree of definition of any Shimura-ordinary \u03c3-crystal is\nthe same as its degree of definition. Similarly, by adapting the proof of the mentioned\nLemma in the context of 2.2.16.5 we get: the minimal degree of definition of any Shimuraordinary adjoint Lie \u03c3-crystal is the same as its A-degree of definition.\nJ. Remarks. 1) In the terminology to be introduced in [Va11], BP4 can be restated\nas: there is a reduced almost stack of p-divisible groups of fixed rank over Fp -schemes.\nIt is easy to see that it is of finite type (for instance, cf. BP1 or cf. Theorem 13 of 14).\nHere by \"reduced almost\" we want to emphasize that we are dealing only with geometric\npoints (as BP4 is stated just in terms of such points).\n404\n\n\f2) Simple examples (like 3.9.7.3) point out that in general, with k = k\u0304, we have\nlimq\u2192\u221e Dq (Cl(M \u2297W (Fpq ) W (k), \u03c6 \u2297 1, GW (k) , (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J )) = \u221e.\nK. For future references we state explicitly the following combined versions of BP0\nand of the first two inequalities of (INEQ) of rm. 0) of B. We assume k = k\u0304.\nCorollary. a) The Dieudonn\u00e9\u2013Fontaine torsion of any cyclic diagonalizable Shimura\nLie \u03c3-crystal is at most the maximum of the deformation dimension of its cyclic factors.\nb) The isom-deviation of any object of p \u2212 M[a,b] (W (k)) which has a lift which is\ncyclic diagonalizable and whose underlying W (k)-module has rank r is at most\n1 + (b \u2212 a)(2r 2 + 1).\nExamples. We refer to 3.13.7.6.3.1. Then under the assumption of its Fact we\nhave DF T (Lie(G), \u03c6\u03031 ) = 1 (cf. ineq. two of (INEQ) of rm. 0) of B). So (cf. BP0)\nthe isom-deviation of (M, \u03c6\u03031 , G) is at most 4. For instance, this applies if (M, \u03c6\u03031 ) is\na direct sum of a finite number of copies of the cyclic diagonalizable \u03c3-crystal attached\nto the type (1, 0, 0, ..., 0) (or to its dual); however, it is easy to see that in this case the\nisom-deviation of (M, \u03c6\u03031 , G) is in fact 1.\nIf moreover Lie \u2212 mod(G) is a Lie-algebra, then we can replace 4 by 3. This is so as\nthe Case 2 of 3.13.7.6.3 can be entirely adapted to the context of Lie \u2212 mod(G). Warning:\nin many cases b) can be significantly improved (to be compared with a)).\n3.15.8. New proof of the specialization theorem. The estimates of 3.15.7 are\ndifferent (though close in nature) to the ones of [Ka2, 1.4-5]. No doubt, the estimates of\nloc. cit. are much sharper. However, the estimates of 3.15.7 give some extra information\n(insight) and in general they can be considerably refined. These refinements will not be\npresented here: to us, it seems far more useful to present a proof of the specialization\ntheorem which uses just very simple (i.e. the most basic) estimates. We recall (see [Gr];\nsee also [Dem, p. 91] and [Ka2]) that Grothendieck proved that under specialization the\nNewton polygons of F -crystals \"go up\", while Katz added (see [Ka2, 2.3.1-2]) that in\nfact for any F -crystal C over an integral Fp -scheme S there is an open, dense subscheme\nU of S such that the Newton polygons of pull backs of C through geometric points of U\nare all the same. Below we concentrate on reproving the existence of U .\nWe start by presenting a homomorphism form of 3.6.15 B. We assume k = k\u0304. Let\n(M1 , \u03c61 ) and (M2 , \u03c62 ) be two \u03c3-crystals over k. Let di := DT (End(Mi ), \u03c6i ) and let si be\nthe s-number of (End(Mi ), \u03c6i ), i = 1, 2. Let s be the s-number of (End(M1 \u2295 M2 ), \u03c61 \u2295\n\u03c62 ). Let d := DT (End(M1 \u2295 M2 ), \u03c61 \u2295 \u03c62 ).\nLet q \u2208 N \u222a {0}. From the proof of 3.6.15 B we get: that the images of the following\ntwo reduction group homomorphisms\nAut(M1 /p2d1 +1+s1 +q M1 , \u03c61 ) \u2192 Aut(M1 /pd1 +1+s1 +q M1 , \u03c61 )\n405\n\n\fand\nAut(M1 , \u03c61 ) \u2192 Aut(M1 /pd1 +1+s1 +q M1 , \u03c61 )\nare the same. Passing from automorphisms to homomorphisms in the standard way we\nget 1) of the following Corollary.\nCorollary (the homomorphism property). 1) Let s\u0303 := s + q + d + 1. The\nfollowing Zp -linear reduction maps\nHom((M1 /pd+s\u0303 M1 , \u03c61 ), (M2 /pd+s\u0303 M2 , \u03c62 )) \u2192 Hom((M1 /ps\u0303 M1 , \u03c61 ), (M2 /ps\u0303 M2 , \u03c62 ))\nand\nHom((M1 , \u03c61 ), (M2 , \u03c62 )) \u2192 Hom((M1 /ps\u0303 M1 , \u03c61 ), (M2 /ps\u0303 M2 , \u03c62 ))\nhave the same image.\n2) There are numbers n, e \u2208 N which depend only on the rank ri of Mi and of the\nmaximal Hodge number hi of (Mi , \u03c6i ), i = 1, 2, such that for \u00f1 := n + q, the images of\nthe two natural restriction maps\nHom((M1 , g1 \u03c61 ), (M2 , g2 \u03c62 )) \u2192 Hom((M1 /p\u00f1 M1 , g1 \u03c61 ), (M2 /p\u00f1 M2 , g2 \u03c62 ))\nand\nHom((M1 /p\u00f1+e M1 , g1 \u03c61 ), (M2 /p\u00f1+e M2 , g2 \u03c62 )) \u2192 Hom((M1 /p\u00f1 M1 , g1 \u03c61 ), (M2 /p\u00f1 M2 , g2 \u03c62 ))\nare the same, \u2200gi \u2208 GL(Mi )(W (k)), i = 1, 2.\n3) Let D1 and D1 be two p-divisible groups over k. There is n \u2208 N which depends\nonly on the rank ri of Di , i = 1, 2, such that a homomorphism D1 [pn+q ] \u2192 D2 [pn+q ]\nlifts to a homomorphism D1 \u2192 D2 iff it lifts to a homomorphism D1 [pn+q+d(r1 +r2 ) ] \u2192\nD2 [pn+q+d(r1 +r2 ) ].\nProof: 2) and 3) are a consequence of 1) and of BP1 (see end of C for the meaning\nof d(r1 + r2 )).\nWe are now ready to proof the existence of U . Let K be the field of fractions of S\nand let CK\u0304 = (M, \u03c6) be the pull back of C to K\u0304. We consider an isogeny\ni : (M1 \u2297W (Fp ) W (K\u0304), \u03c61 \u2297 1) \u2192 (M, \u03c6),\nwith (M1 , \u03c61 ) a Dieudonn\u00e9 object of p\u2212M(W (Fp )). Let h1 be the h-number of (M1 , \u03c61 ).\nWe take q \u2208 N such that we have pq M \u2282 i(M1 ). Localizing, we can assume that the\nh-numbers of pull backs of C through geometric points of S are all bounded above by the\nsame number hC. Let m := dimW (K\u0304) (M ). Let\nf := 1 + max{h1 , hC} + 2g(4m2 , max{h1 , hC}, 2 max{h1 , hC})\n406\n\n\f(cf. the paragraph after BP2). The s-number (resp. the h-number) of the End of the\ndirect sum of (M1 \u2297W (Fp ) W (k1 ), \u03c61 \u2297 1) with the pull back of C through any k1 -valued\npoint of S is at most max{h1 , hC} (resp. at most 2 max{h1 , hC}); here k1 is an arbitrary\nalgebraically closed field containing Fp . Let q\u0303 \u2208 N be greater or equal to e obtained in 2)\nfor h2 := hC and r2 = r1 = m.\nWe consider the reduction i(q + q\u0303 + f ) of i mod q + q\u0303 + f ; we view it as a morphism\nbetween (non-filtered) W (K\u0304)-modules endowed with connections and Frobenius endomorphisms subject to axioms similar to the ones of MF \u2207 (W (K\u0304)). The connections are\nof course initially (i.e. over W (K\u0304)) trivial; though in what follows, they do not play any\nrelevant role, we still feel appropriate to keep track of them. i(q + q\u0303 + f ) is defined over a\nfinite field extension K1 of K (even if K does not have a finite p-basis). Replacing S by\nits normalization S1 in K1 , as the continuous map underlying the morphism S1 \u2192 S is\nproper, we can assume K1 = K. Localizing, we deduce the existence of an affine, open,\nnon-empty subscheme U = Spec(R\u0304) of S such that we have a morphism\ni(q + q\u0303 + f )U : (M1 /pq+q\u0303+f M1 , \u03c61 )U \u2192 CU /pq+q\u0303+f CU ,\nwith the lower index U meaning the pull back to U ; we view it (cf. also [Be, 1.6.4 of\np. 246 and 1.2.1 of p. 91]) as being a morphism between truncations mod pq+q\u0303+f of\nobjects of p \u2212 MOD \u2207 (W (R\u0304)). This last category is defined similarly to p \u2212 M\u2207 (W (R\u0304))\nof 2.2.1.7 4) but this time we do not assume:\n\u2013 that the OU -sheaf \u03a9R\u0304/k is locally free of locally finite rank;\n\u2013 or that we can \"put\" some adequate filtrations on the underlying sheaves of its\nobjects (this conforms to 1) of 3.15.7 B).\nWe can assume the cokernel of i(q + q\u0303 + f )U is annihilated by pq . From 2) we\ndeduce that for any geometric point y1 : Spec(k1 ) \u2192 U , the truncation mod pq+f of\ny1\u2217 (i(q + q\u0303 + f )U ) lifts to a morphism\niy1 : (M1 \u2297W (Fp ) W (k1 ), \u03c61 \u2297 1) \u2192 y1\u2217 (C)\nof \u03c3-crystals. As the cokernel of its reduction mod pq+q\u0303+f is annihilated by pq , we get\niy1 is injective and so, by reasons of ranks, it is an isogeny. So the Newton polygon of\ny1\u2217 (C) does not depend on y1 . This ends the proof of the existence of U .\n3.15.9. Three main specialization approaches. Here, in connection to the\nspecialization theorem, we include three main specialization approaches; not to make this\npaper too long, we just list their principles without performing any explicit computations\n(see \u00a79-10 for such computations). We assume k = k\u0304; however, everything else except\nthe application of 3.15.7 BP2 to be presented below holds for an arbitrary k. We use the\nnotations of 3.13.7.1. So (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ) is a Shimura filtered \u03c3-crystal with an\nemphasized family of tensors over k, \u03bc is a cocharacter of G defining its filtration class,\n\u03c61 := g \u22121 \u03c6 where g \u2208 G(W (k)) is such that (M, F 1 , \u03c61 , G) is a Shimura-canonical lift,\nGZp is a Zp -structure of G defined naturally by (M, F 1 , \u03c61 , G), while N + , P 0 and P \u2212\n407\n\n\fare subgroups of G defined naturally by \u03bc. \u03c3 acts on W (k)-valued points of G via this\nZp -structure. Let n := 1 + f (dM , 1, 0). Let\nHW (k) := N + \u00d7W (k) P 0 \u00d7W (k) N \u2212 .\nIts special fibre is H as defined in 3.13.7.1. Let T have the same significance as in 3.13.7.1.\nFor g\u0303 \u2208 G(W (k)) we denote by g\u0303(n) its reduction mod pn . Let g1 \u2208 G(W (k)) be such\nthat g(1) factors through the Zariski closure of the orbit o1 of g1 (1) under T in Gk .\nWe consider the morphism\nm(n) : HWn (k) \u2192 GWn (k)\nwhich at the level of W (k)-valued points takes a triple\n(h1 , h2 , h3 ) \u2208 N + (Wn (k)) \u00d7 P 0 (Wn (k)) \u00d7 N \u2212 (Wn (k))\ninto the Wn (k)-valued point of G defined by\n\u22121\n\u22121 \u22121\nh1 h2 h3 g1 (n)\u03c3(h\u22121\n(n);\n3 )\u03c3(h2 )\u03c3(ph1 )g\n\nN + is a direct sum of copies of Ga and so it makes sense to multiply its elements by p; this\n\u22121\ndefines \u03c3(ph\u22121\n(1). We consider a Wn (k1 )-valued\n1 ). The image of m(n)k is t1 := o1 g\n0\npoint zn of HWn (k) , with k1 a field (not necessarily perfect), such that:\na) the k1 -valued point of G defined by m(n) \u25e6 zn0 mod p sits over the generic point s\nof t1 ;\nb) the k1 -valued point of H we get is a closed point sh such that the resulting field\nextension k0 \u0592\u2192 k1 at the level of residue fields of s and sH is totally inseparable and of\nfinite degree; let m be its degree.\nFor the totally inseparable part of b) we just have to recall that T is a group action (if\nthe stabilizer subgroup of g1 (1) under T is smooth, then we can take m = 1). Let zn be the\n, viewed as an endomorphism of Spec(W (k1 )), with zn0 . m(n)\u25e6zn factors\ncomposite of \u03c3kmn\n1\nthrough Spec(Wn (k0 )) (cf. b)); let wn : Spec(Wn (k0 )) \u2192 GWn (k) be this factorization.\nLet k\u0303 := k0 .\ns specializes to the origin of Gk . So we consider an affine, open subscheme U of G\nthrough which the origin of G factors and such that we have an \u00e9tale morphism from\ndimW (k) (G)\nit into AW (k)\n. Identifying Wn (Uk ) with UWn (k) (this is as in 3.15.3 6)), often it is\npossible to show the existence of a Frobenius lift \u03a6U of U \u2227 such that its reduction \u03a6U (n)\nmod pn is compatible with the factorization (still denoted by wn ) of wn through U , i.e.\nwe have\n(COM P )\n\nwn \u25e6 \u03c3k0 (n) = \u03a6U (n) \u25e6 wn ,\n408\n\n\fwhere \u03c3k0 (n) is the Frobenius endomorphism of Spec(Wn (k0 )). In what follows we assume\nsuch an \u03a6U exists.\nWe apply a variant of 3.6.1.3 in the context of (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ) and of (U, \u03a6U );\nthe difference from 3.6.1.3, 3.6.10 or 3.6.18.6 is: \u03a6U is not necessarily of essentially\nadditive type in the origin of Uk . We deduce the existence of a Shimura p-divisible group\n(D, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ) over the p-adic completion of an N-pro-\u00e9tale scheme U1 over U which is\nuniversal in some specific sense. We do not need this universality. What we need: U1k\nis an AG k-scheme and so each k\u0303-valued point of Uk lifts to a k\u0303-valued of U1k ; here k\u0303 is\nan algebraically closed field containing k. We consider an arbitrary k-valued point y1 of\nU1k lifting the origin of Uk . We get:\n1) The Shimura \u03c3-crystal associated to y1\u2217 (D, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ) is inner isomorphic to the\nShimura \u03c3-crystal (M, g2 \u03c6, G, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ), with g2 \u2208 G(W (k)) congruent to the identity\nmod p.\n2) The Shimura \u03c3k\u0303 -crystal associated to the pull back of (D, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ) through a\nW (k\u0303)-valued point y2 of U1 such that its special fibre specializes to y1 and the Wn (k\u0303)valued point of G it defines naturally factors through wn , is isomorphic to (M \u2297W (k)\nW (k\u0303), g3 (g1 \u03c6 \u2297 1), GW (k\u0303) , (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ), with g3 \u2208 G(W (k\u0303)) congruent to the identity mod\nn \u2212 1 = f (dM , 1, 0).\n2) is a consequence of (COMP) and of the construction of m(n) (we recall that s\nspecializes to the origin of Uk ). Using 3.4.15 BP2' we get:\n3) In 2) we can assume g3 is 1M .\nRemarks. 1) This forms the going down form of the inductive specialization approach. At least if m = 1 there are variants mod pn of this approach. As we do not stop\nto analyze when \u03a6U indeed exists, there is no point to include these variants here.\n2) There is as well a going up form of the inductive specialization approach; in\nessence it is nothing else but the combination of 3.6.1.3 with the touching property of\n3.6.18.4.3 and with the possibility of concretely constructing (in many situations; see H)\nisom-constant deformations.\n3) There is as well a parallel approach: this is entirely similar to the algebraization\nprocess of the proof of 3.6.18.4.1. So using either 3.6.18.4.3 or the Fact of 3.6.18.9 as well\nas the Chinese Reminder Theorem (as in the mentioned) proof, one tries to connect two\nShimura \u03c3-crystals through a global deformation which has some specific properties like\n(it is isom-constant, or has a constant Newton polygon, etc.).\n3.15.10. The second (Newton polygon) form of the purity principle. 3.6.15\nB was obtained independently of [dJO, \u00a72-4]. However loc. cit. and the estimates of\n3.15.7 share one common think: they both use Dieudonn\u00e9's objects of p \u2212 M(W (k)\n(i.e. Dieudonn\u00e9's classification); but we would like to point out that we think it is more\nappropriate to use in general (in connect to 3.15.7-10 and loc. cit.) Dieudonn\u00e9\u2013Fontaine's\nobjects instead of Dieudonn\u00e9's objects (of p \u2212 M(W (k)). Moreover, the ideas of 3.6.15 B\n(in the form of the Corollary of 3.15.8) can be combined with [Ka2, 2.7.4] to get slightly\n409\n\n\fbetter results (with much simpler proofs) than what [dJO, 4.1] gives. The goal of this\nsection is to prove the following Theorem.\nTheorem. Let S be an integral Fp -scheme. Let C be an F -crystal on S. We assume\nthere is b0 \u2208 N such that the h-number of all pull backs of C through geometric points of S\nare all bounded above by b0 . Let U be the maximal open, dense subscheme of S such that\nthe Newton polygons of pull backs of C through geometric points of U are all the same (see\n3.15.8). We also assume that, locally in the Zariski topology of S, the normalization U n\nof U in the field of fractions of S is regular in codimension 1 and any dominant, normal,\naffine U n -scheme which is finite above spectra of local rings of U n which are DVR, is the\nnormalization of U n in a finite field extension of the field of fractions K of S. Then U\nis an affine S-scheme.\nProof: Let r be the rank of C. We can assume S = Spec(R) is affine and (cf.\nExercise of 3.6.8.1.4) normal. So U = U n . To prove that U is affine, we are allowed\n(as the conditions on U allow us) to replace S by its normalization in any finite field\nextension of K. Let C0 be a Dieudonn\u00e9 object of p \u2212 M(Fp ) such that we have an isogeny\nC0K\u0304 \u0592\u2192 CK\u0304 . Let b be the maximum of b0 and of the maximal slope of C0 . Let\nn := 1 + b + 2g(4r 2 , b, 2b)\nbe as in the paragraph after 3.15.7 BP2. Its first role is: the Newton polygons of pull\nbacks of C through geometric points of S depend only on their truncations mod pn (cf.\nBP0-1; here the role of b is the same as of max{h1 , hC} in 3.15.8). In what follows we\ntake m \u2208 N, m \u2265 n (to be specified at the right time).\nWarning: till the end of the proof, in order to fully accommodate the context of\nnon-perfect Fp -schemes, we use the terminology F -crystals in the sense of (truncations)\nof objects of p \u2212 MOD \u2207 (W (\u2217)), with \u2217 standing for Fp -algebras or affine Fp -schemes\n(this new terminology, is not an impediment from the point of view of Newton polygons\nas they can be computed via pull backs through geometric points); p \u2212 MOD \u2207 (W (\u2217)) is\ninterpreted as in 3.15.8 (so its objects are locally free of locally finite ranks OSpec(W (\u2217)) sheaves endowed with integrable, nilpotent mod p connections and with Frobenius endomorphisms which satisfy the logical axiom connecting the Frobenius endomorphisms\nwith the connections). We use right lower indices by schemes for pull backs of F -crystals.\nLocalizing and using Witt rings, we can assume there is a finitely generated Fp subalgebra R0 of R such that C/pm C is obtained as the pull back to S of an F -crystal\nC[m]0 on S0 := Spec(R0 ) in coherent sheaves annihilated by pm . Warning: here we\nalready use the convention of the previous paragraph.\nUsing [Ka2, 2.7.4] we deduce that for any DVR, local ring V of U , there is a perfect,\nfaithfully flat V -algebra V1 such that we have an isogeny iV1 : C0V1 \u2192 CV1 of F -crystals.\nLet nV \u2208 N be the smallest number such that the inclusion pnV CV1 \u0592\u2192 CV1 factors through\niV1 .\nClaim 1. There is q \u2208 N, depending only on C0 and not on V , such that we can\nassume nV \u2264 q.\n410\n\n\fThe proofs of [Ka2, 2.6.1-2 and 2.7.1] (they are forming the ingredient needed to get\n[Ka2, 2.7.4]) imply that there is q\u0303 \u2208 N which does not depend on V (q\u0303 depends only on\nthe Newton polygon of C0 ) such that we have an isogeny CV0V1 \u2192 CV1 whose cokernel is\nannihilated by pq\u0303 , with CV0 an F -crystal on Fp . But the h-number (resp. the s-number)\nof CV0 (resp. of End(CV0 )) is at most b + q\u0303 (resp. at most b + 2q\u0303). So Claim 1 follows\nfrom 3.15.7 BP1.\nWe can assume q is greater than 2b and 2(c + 1), where c \u2208 N is such that C0 is an\nobject of p \u2212 M[0,c] (W (k)). We take (for instance)\nm := 7q + 2n + 1.\nLet\niV1 (m) : C0V1 /pm C0V1 \u2192 CV1 /pm CV1\nbe the truncation mod pm of iV1 . Using standard arguments of algebraic geometry we\ndeduce the existence of a finite field extension KV of K such that we can assume we have\na similar morphism iU1 (V ) (m), with Spec(U1 (V )) as an open subscheme of the normalization of U in KV through which Spec(V1 ) \u2192 U factors, whose cokernel is annihilated\nby pq and which is the truncation mod pm of a morphism C0U1 (V ) /pm+2q C0U1 (V ) \u2192\nCU1 (V ) /pm+2q CU1 (m) . But the number of morphisms C0K\u0304 /pm C0K\u0304 \u2192 CK\u0304 /pm CK\u0304 which\nare the truncation mod pm of morphisms C0K\u0304 /pm+n C0K\u0304 \u2192 CK\u0304 /pm+n CK\u0304 is finite (this\nfollows from the fact that any such morphism lifts to a morphism C0K\u0304 \u2192 CK\u0304 , cf. 3.15.8\n1) and the definition of n). So we can assume KV does not depend on V and so we can\nassume KV = K.\nWe reached the following situation. There is a finite number of open subschemes Ui ,\ni \u2208 I, of U such that:\n1) each point of U of codimension 1 belongs to some Ui ;\n2) for each i \u2208 I, we have a morphism iUi (m) : C0Ui /pm C0Ui \u2192 CUi /pm CUi , whose\ncokernel and kernel are annihilated by pq .\nWhat follows next is a method of \"gluing\" iUi (m)'s, i \u2208 I (which we hope to be\nuseful in other situations). It is enough to \"glue\" these morphisms generically. So let\nli (m) : C0K\u0304 /pm C0K\u0304 \u2192 CK\u0304 /pm CK\u0304 ,\nbe the morphism naturally defined by iUi (m), i \u2208 I. From 1) of the Corollary of 3.15.8\nwe get that there is li : C0K\u0304 \u2192 CK\u0304 such that its reduction mod pm\u2212n lifts the truncation\nmod pm\u2212n of li (M ). li 's are isogenies and in fact their cokernels are still annihilated by\npq . Let l : C0K\u0304 \u2192 CK\u0304 be an isogeny such that:\n3) its image lies inside the intersection of the images of all li 's (i \u2208 I);\n4) its cokernel is annihilated by p2q .\nFor 4) we need to point out that we can take as l any pq li (m), with i \u2208 I. Let si be\nthe factorization of l through li . As in above part referring to KV 's, we can assume that\n411\n\n\fthe truncations mod pm\u2212q of l and of all si 's are all definable over K and not only over K\u0304.\nAs si 'a are definable over finite fields, we can assume as well that si extends (uniquely)\nto a morphism sUi : C0Ui /pm\u2212q C0Ui \u2192 CUi /pm\u2212q CUi . So we can glue the composite of\nsUi with the truncation mod pm\u2212q of iUi (m), i \u2208 I, to get a morphism\niU0 (m \u2212 q) : C0U0 /pm\u2212q C0U0 \u2192 CU0 /pm\u2212q CU0 ,\nwith U0 an open subscheme of U such that the codimension of U \\ U0 in U is at least 2,\nwhose kernel and cokernel are annihilated by p2q .\nWe consider the S-scheme S1 parameterizing morphisms from C0S /pm\u22122q C0S to\nC/pm\u22122q C. It is an affine S-scheme, locally of finite presentation. Let U \u2032 be the normalization of the Zariski closure of U0 in S1 defined naturally by iU0 (m \u2212 q) and let\niU \u2032 (m \u2212 q) be the natural extension of iU0 (m \u2212 q) to it. From our hypotheses we get: U\nis naturally an open subscheme of U \u2032 . So the Theorem follows from the following Claim.\nClaim 2. U is an affine subscheme of U \u2032 .\nProof: We can assume U \u2032 is an open subscheme of S (otherwise we replace S by U \u2032 ).\nWe can assume U \u2032 and iU \u2032 (m \u2212 q) are obtained by pull backs from an open subscheme\nU0\u2032 of S0 and respectively from a morphism\niU0\u2032 (m \u2212 q) : C0U0\u2032 /pm\u2212q C0U0\u2032 \u2192 C[m]0 /pm\u2212q C[m]0 .\nWe can assume we have a similar morphism\n\u0129U0 (m \u2212 q) : Ct0U0 /pm\u2212q Ct0U0 \u2192 CtU0 /pm\u2212q CtU0 ,\nwhose cokernel is annihilated by p2q (by shrinking, we can assume we have the same\nU0 ). Here the right upper index t means (taking) the dual. Strictly speaking we have to\nperform first Tate twists: we need to tensor all these duals by the pull back of Fp (q) to S;\nnot to introduce extra notations we do not mention it. So, starting from it, we similarly\ndefine \u0168 \u2032 , \u01680\u2032 . Moreover, we similarly get that \u0168 \u2032 is affine and that U is naturally an\nopen subscheme of \u0168 \u2032 . We can assume \u0168 \u2032 is as well an open subscheme of S.\nAs S is separated, U \u2032 \u2229\u0168 \u2032 is an affine scheme. So it is enough to show that U = U \u2032 \u2229\u0168 \u2032 .\nWe assume this is not so. So there is a geometric point y : Spec(k) \u2192 U \u2032 \u2229 \u0168 \u2032 \\ U . We\nconsider a morphism my : Spec(k[[T ]]) \u2192 U0\u2032 \u2229 \u01680\u2032 , whose special fibre factors through y\nand whose generic fibre factors through the generic point of U0\u2032 \u2229 \u01680\u2032 . We consider the\npull back morphism\nly (m \u2212 2q) : C0k /pm\u22122q C0k \u2192 y \u2217 (C/pm\u22122q C).\nWe consider the composite co of iU0 (m\u2212q) with the dual of \u0129U0 (m\u2212q). The cokernel\nof y (co) is annihilated by p2q+2q+q = p5q : q \u2265 2(c + 1) > c and as co is a morphism\nbetween constant F -crystals, this is checked (cf. b) of 2.2.4 B) by pulling back co via\ngeometric, dominant points of U0 ; an extra pq is added here due to Tate twists. So the\n\u2217\n\n412\n\n\fkernel of y \u2217 (co) is as well annihilated by p5q . We conclude: the kernel and so also the\ncokernel of ly (m \u2212 2q) are annihilated by p5q .\nFrom 1) of the Corollary of 3.15.8 we deduce the existence of a morphism ly\u221e : C0k \u2192\ny \u2217 (C) lifting the truncation mod pm\u2212n\u22122q of ly (m \u2212 2q). As the cokernel of ly (m \u2212 2q)\nis annihilated by p5q and as m \u2212 2q \u2212 n \u2265 5q + 1, ly\u221e is injective and so an isogeny.\nSo y factors through U . Contradiction. This ends the proof of the Claim and so of the\nTheorem.\n3.15.10.1. Remarks. 0) The assumption on the existence of b0 \u2208 N such that the\nh-number of all pull backs of C through geometric points of S are all bounded above by b0\nis automatically satisfied locally, as one can see by evaluating the r-th exterior power of\nC at (the thickening of S defined naturally by) W (S). So the Theorem holds without it;\nhowever, without assuming it, the estimates of its proof on n, m, etc., hold only locally.\n1) The second assumption on U (of the Theorem) is satisfied, for instance, if U is a\nKrull scheme (i.e. if it has an open cover by affine, open subschemes which are spectra\nof Krull Z-algebras); see [Sam, \u00a73 and 4.5 of ch. 1]. In particular, the Theorem applies\nif S is (the normalization of) a locally noetherian, integral scheme N S in a finite field\nextension of the field of fractions of N S (cf. [Ma, rm. 2 at the end of ch. 7]). We have\nvariants of the Theorem, by working (i.e. by putting conditions on U ) in the faithfully\nflat topology (of S).\n2) The two conditions on U are not needed at least if we are in a context in which\nliftings of truncations (in a context involving connections) can be performed. To exemplify\nwhat we mean by this, we check that this condition is not needed for the context of an\nobject C of p \u2212 M[0,1](S) (and so, in particular, for the context of a p-divisible group over\nS).\nWe refer to the above proof. For any point \u1ef9 of S0 of codimension 1, there is an open,\naffine subscheme \u0168 (\u1ef9) of S0 containing it and an N-pro-\u00e9tale morphism \u0168 (\u1ef9; pro) \u2192 \u0168 (\u1ef9)\nsuch that C[m]0\u0168 (\u1ef9;pro) is the truncation mod pm of an object of p \u2212 M\u2207\n[0,1] (\u0168 (\u1ef9; pro))\n(cf. Fact of 2.2.1.1 6) and 3.6.18.6 and its p = 2 version; see the proof of 3.15.1).\nThe Newton polygon stratification of \u0168 (\u1ef9; pro) defined by such an object is obtained\nfrom a stratification of \u0168 (\u1ef9) by pull back (cf. 3.6.20 1) and the fact that m \u2265 n).\n\u2032\nLet U00\nbe the open, dense subscheme of S0 over which, using such lifts, we get the\n\u2032\nsame Newton polygon as of C0 . We assume now \u1ef9 is a point of U00\n. Denoting by\n\u1e7c the local ring of \u1ef9, based on the mentioned lift, we can still construct morphisms\ni\u01681 (\u1e7c ) : C0\u01681 (\u1e7c ) /pm C0\u01681 (\u1e7c ) \u2192 C\u01681 (\u1e7c ) /pm C\u01681 (\u1e7c ) , with \u01681 (\u1e7c ) as an open subscheme of\n\u2032\nthe normalization of U00\nin a finite field extension of the field of fractions K0 of R0 , whose\nkernels and cokernels are annihilated by pq . Once we have them, we can proceed as in\n\u2032\nthe above proof to get that U00\nis affine. So, using pull backs we get U is affine.\nSimilarly, using 3.15.6 D, we get that these two conditions on U are not needed if\nwe are in a generalized Shimura context. Warning: for the context of p-divisible groups,\nwe can use as well standard arguments of algebraic geometry and [Il, 4.8] to reduce the\nsituation to the context of a local, complete, noetherian S; but this is not possible for\nthe generalized Shimura context.\n413\n\n\f3) The proof of 3.15.10 is one of the main extra ingredients needed to get global\nvariants of 3.6.15 B. See \u00a79-10 for such variants.\n\n414\n\n\f415\n\n\f\u00a74 Applications of the basic results to integral canonical models of\nShimura varieties of preabelian type, to p-divisible groups,\nand to abelian varieties\n\n4.1-8 and 4.11 form a sequence continuing 2.3. They represent a foundation of\nintegral aspects of Shimura varieties of Hodge type in cases of good reduction. In 4.910 and 4.12-13 we extend this foundation from the Hodge type to the preabelian type.\nIn 4.1-13, with very few exceptions, we assume p \u2265 3. Some overviewing remarks are\nincluded in 4.14. In particular, 4.14.3 handles to a great extend the case p = 2. So\nin 4.1-14 we deal with many generalizations of classical theories (of Serre\u2013Tate, Manin,\nDwork, etc.).\n\u00a73 contains much more than what is needed for applications to integral canonical\nmodels of Shimura varieties of preabelian type. In 4.1-9 and 4.11-14 we try to make as\nlittle use of \u00a73 as possible. In particular, we avoid the use of 3.6, except of its independent\nLemma 3.6.6; even the use of 3.6.6 is in fact entirely avoidable, cf. 3.4.14. By making as\nlittle use as possible of \u00a73, inevitably parts of \u00a73 are getting in \u00a74 a second or third proof.\nWe start with a SHS (f, L(p) , v). We recall that conventions 2.3.7 and 2.3.9.2 apply.\nIn all that follows k is a perfect field of characteristic p.\n4.1. The Shimura-ordinary type. Let L\u2217p := L\u2217(p) \u2297Z(p) Zp . We also view GZp as\na subgroup of GL(L\u2217p ). Let T be a maximal torus of GZp such that:\n1) there is a cocharacter \u03bc : Gm \u0592\u2192 TW (k(v)) whose extension to C under an O(v) monomorphism W (k(v)) \u0592\u2192 C, is G(C)-conjugate to the cocharacters \u03bc\u2217x : Gm \u0592\u2192 GC ,\nx \u2208 X;\n2) there is a Borel subgroup B of GZp , whose Lie algebra is such that its elements\ntake the F 1 -filtration of L\u2217p \u2297Zp W (k(v)) defined by \u03bc into itself, i.e. we have Lie(B) \u2282\n\u0001\nF 0 Lie(GW (k(v)) ) .\nWe recall that \u03bc gives birth to a direct sum decomposition\nL\u2217p \u2297Zp W (k(v)) = F 1 \u2295 F 0 ,\n\u0001\nwith \u03b2 \u2208 Gm W (k(v)) acting through \u03bc on F i as the multiplication with \u03b2 \u2212i , i = 0, 1.\nFor instance, we can take B to be an arbitrary Borel subgroup of GZp and T to be\na maximal torus of B. So T (resp. TW (k(v)) ) contains a maximal split Zp -torus (resp.\nW (k(v))-torus) of GZp (resp. of GW (k(v)) ) and TB(k(v)) contains a maximal split torus\nof GB(k(v)) (for instance, see [Ti2]). From the definition of the reflex field (for instance,\nsee [Va2, 2.6]) we get (see [Mi3, 4.6-7]): B(k(v)) is the field of definition of the G(C)conjugacy class of cocharacters \u03bc\u2217x , x \u2208 X, of the extension of GQp to C under the\n416\n\n\fcomposite of the inclusion Qp \u0592\u2192 B(k(v)) with an O(v) -monomorphism B(k(v)) \u0592\u2192 C. So\nfrom loc. cit. and the fact that any two maximal split tori of GB(k(v)) are G(B(k(v)))conjugate (see [Bo2, 20.9 (ii)]) we get that we can choose a cocharacter \u03bc as in 1); as any\ntwo Borel subgroups of GW (k(v)) containing a fixed maximal split torus of GW (k(v)) are\nconjugate under an element of GW (k(v)) (W (k(v)) normalizing this torus (based on [Bo2,\n20.9 (i) and (ii)] this can be proved following the pattern of the proof of Fact 1 of 2.2.9\n3)), we can assume that 2) holds as well.\nIn what follows, T and B are fixed subject to 1) and 2): we do not assume a priori\nthat they are chosen as described in the previous paragraph. So B not necessarily contains\nT ; however, it must contain the smallest subtorus T\u03bc of T with the property that the\ncocharacter \u03bc of TW (k(v)) factors through T\u03bc W (k(v)) . So T can be any maximal torus of\nthe centralizer of T\u03bc in GZp ; in particular, it is not necessarily unique up to GZp (Zp )conjugation. However, as any two maximal tori of B are B(Zp )-conjugate and as any\ntwo Borel subgroups of GZp are GZp (Zp )-conjugate (these statements can be checked by\njust following the pattern of the proof of Fact 1 of 2.2.9 3), starting from [Bo2, 19.2\nand 20.9 (i)] applied over Fp ), we get that T\u03bc and \u03bc are uniquely determined up to\nGZp (Zp )-conjugation.\nWe refer to (GZp , [\u03bc]) as the Shimura group pair defined by (G, X, H, v). We similarly\ndefine the Shimura group pair defined by any Shimura quadruple (G1 , X1 , H1 , v1 ).\n4.1.1. The definition. The Shimura-ordinary type \u03c4 associated to (or defined by)\nthe SHS (f, L(p) , v) is the formal isogeny type associated to the \u03c3-crystal over k(v)\nC(f,v) := (L\u2217p \u2297Zp W (k(v)), \u03c6)\ndefined by \u03c6 := \u03c3\u03bc\n\n1\np\n\n\u0001\n\n. Here the Frobenius automorphism\n\u03c3 := \u03c3k(v)\n\nof W (k(v)) is as well identified with the \u03c3-linear automorphism of L\u2217p \u2297Zp W (k(v)) fixing\nL\u2217p . As the notation suggests, C(f,v) does not depend on the choice of L(p) (producing a\nSHS (f, L(p) , v)) or on the choices of T or B (subject to 1) and 2) of 4.1): it depends only\non T\u03bc , on \u03bc and on the representation of T\u03bcQp on L\u2217 [ p1 ], i.e. (cf. 4.1) it depends only on\nf and v.\nLet r(f, v) \u2208 N \u222a {0} be the multiplicity of its slope 1. Let F L(f, v), IL(f, v),\nSKL(f, v), CL(f, v) and SDL(f, v) be respectively the factor length, the isotype length,\nthe skeleton length, the circular length and the slope denominator length of the extension\nof C(f,v) to F (cf. I of 2.2.22 3)).\nIn 4.1 1) we can replace k(v) by any other finite field: such a field must contain k(v)\nand in fact \u03bc is automatically definable over W (k(v)), cf. [Mi3, 4.6-7]. Moreover, if in 4.1\n2) we replace B by a parabolic subgroup P AR of GZp , then we regain the same Shimuraordinary type: this is a consequence of the fact that P AR contains a Borel subgroup of\nGZp (cf. Fact of 2.2.3 3) and [Bo2, 21.12] applied to GQp ).\n417\n\n\fLet\n\n\u0001\n4.1.1.1. Simple properties. Let M := L\u2217p \u2297Zp W (k(v)) and let t := Lie TW (k(v)) .\nh\u03041 : M \u2192 M\n\nbe the endomorphism defined by: h\u03041 (x) = 0 if x \u2208 F 0 and h\u03041 (x) = x if x \u2208 F 1 . h\u03041 is an\nelement of t. Let d(v) \u2208 N be such that |k(v)| = pd(v) ; so k(v) = Fpd(v) and F = k(v).\nIn what follows, as d(v) is used very often, we denote it in a simpler way by d. For\ni \u2208 S(1, d \u2212 1), let h\u0304i+1 := \u03c6i (h\u03041 ). We have:\nFact 1. \u03c6d (h\u03041 ) = h\u03041 and h\u0304i+1 6= h\u03041 , \u2200i \u2208 S(1, d \u2212 1).\nProof: We have \u03c6i (h\u03041 ) = \u03c3 i (h\u03041 ). So, Fact 1 follows from [Mi3, 4.6-7]: [\u03bc] can not\nbe defined over W (k1 ), with k1 a subfield of k(v) different from k(v).\nLet\nd\n\n1\n1X\nh\u0304i \u2208 t[ ]\nh :=\nd i=1\np\n0\n\nWe have:\nFact 2. \u03c6(h0 ) = \u03c3(h0 ) = h0 . Moreover, the slopes of the \u03c3-crystal (M, \u03c6) are the\neigenvalues of h0 (acting on M [ p1 ]) and the multiplicities are the same.\nProof: The first part is obvious. The second part results from the fact that \u03c6d is\na B(k(v))-valued of TW (k(v)) fixed by the action of \u03c3 on TW (k(v)) and the eigenspaces\nof its action on M [ p1 ] are the same as the ones of dh0 , the eigenvalues (counted with\nmultiplicities) being p to those powers which are eigenvalues (counted with multiplicities)\nof dh0 . This is a consequence of the fact that h\u0304i \u2208 t, \u2200i \u2208 S(1, d), and so of the fact that\nthe endomorphisms h\u0304i 's are commuting among themselves.\n\b\nMore precisely, if x\u0303 \u2208 Mi := x \u2208 M |h0 (x) = di x , with L\ni \u2208 S(0, d), and if x\u0303 6\u2208 pM ,\nthen \u03c6d (x\u0303) = pi \u1ef9, with \u1ef9 \u2208 Mi \\pM . Moreover, we have M = 0\u2264i\u2264d Mi . To check these\nlast two statements, we first remark that each element of Lie(T ) is fixed by \u03c6; adding these\nelements to the family (v\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J \u2032 , we get that (M, F 1 , \u03c6, TW (k(v)) ) is a Shimura filtered\n\u03c3-crystal. From Corollary of 2.2.9 3), we get that \u03bc is the canonical split of (M, F 1 , \u03c6).\nSo the statements follow from 2.2.1.1 4) and the first paragraph of G of 2.2.22 3).\n4.1.1.2. The Lie counterpart. Let LieG (\u03c4 ) be the formal isogeny type associated\nto the Shimura Lie \u03c3-crystal\n\u0001\nLie(GW (k(v)) ), \u03c6\n\nattached to the Shimura \u03c3-crystal (M, \u03c6, GW (k(v)), (v\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J \u2032 ). As above, the slopes of it\nare the eigenvalues of h0 (acting on Lie(GB(k(v)) ) via the rule: x is mapped into [h0 , x])\nand the multiplicities are the same. We call it the Shimura-ordinary Lie type associated\nto (or defined by) the SHS (f, L(p) , v). Let r(v ad ) \u2208 N \u222a {0} be the multiplicity of its\nslope \u22121. Let SS(v ad ) be the set of its slopes; it is a subset of [\u22121, 1] \u2229 Q, symmetric\nw.r.t. 0 (cf. 2.2.3 1)); moreover, always 0 \u2208 SS(v ad ).\n418\n\n\f4.1.1.3. Remark. Similarly to 4.1.1, LieG (\u03c4 ) depends only on the adjoint Shimura\npair (Gad , X ad ), on the rank of Gab and on v ad . So, as the notations suggest, r(v ad ) and\nSS(v ad ) depend only on (Gad , X ad ) and on v ad .\n4.1.1.4. Some decompositions. For any i \u2208 S(1, d) and j \u2208 {0, 1} we denote by\nF j the free W (k(v))-submodule of M on which h\u0304i acts trivially if j = 0 and identically\nif j = 1. For any function f \u0304 : S(1, d) \u2192 {0, 1} we denote by\ni\n\nFf \u0304 :=\n\n\\\n\ni\n\n \u0304\n\nF f (i) .\n\ni\u2208S(1,d)\n\nLet L be the set of functions f \u0304 as above for which Ff \u0304 6= 0. We get a direct sum\ndecomposition\nM = \u2295f \u0304\u2208L Ff \u0304\ndue to the fact that h\u0304i 's are commuting among themselves. Let\n\u03c6\u0304 : L \u2192 L\nbe the bijection defined by the rule: \u03c6\u0304(f \u0304)(i) = f \u0304(i \u2212 1); here f \u0304(0) := f \u0304(d). From the very\ndefinition of Ff \u0304's we get:\na) \u03c6(Ff \u0304) = F\u03c6\u0304(f \u0304) if f \u0304(1) = 0;\nb) \u03c6(Ff \u0304) = pF\u03c6\u0304(f \u0304) if f \u0304(1) = 1.\nQ\nLet \u03c6\u0304 = l\u2208I\u03c6\u0304 \u03c6\u0304l be written as a product of disjoint cyclic permutations. We allow\ntrivial cyclic permutations. So we have a disjoint union\nI\u03c6\u0304 = I\u03c6\u03041 \u222a I\u03c6\u03040 ;\nl \u2208 I\u03c6\u0304 belongs to I\u03c6\u03041 iff \u03c6\u0304l is a non-trivial permutation (and then any f \u0304 \u2208 L such that\n\u03c6\u0304l (f \u0304) 6= f \u0304 is said to be associated to \u03c6\u0304l ). So I\u03c6\u03040 := {f \u0304 \u2208 L|\u03c6\u0304(f \u0304) = f \u0304}; any f \u0304 \u2208 I\u03c6\u03040 is said\nto be associated to \u03c6\u0304f \u0304. I\u03c6\u03040 has either 0 or 2 elements depending on the fact that r(f, v)\nis 0 or not. As \u03c6\u0304d = 1L , we get that the order dl of the cyclic permutation \u03c6\u0304l divides d.\nFor any l \u2208 I\u03c6\u0304 , we choose arbitrarily an element f \u0304l of L which is associated to \u03c6\u0304l . We\nhave\ndl\n \u0304\n\u03c6dl (Ff \u0304l ) = p d l(fl ) Ff \u0304l ,\nwith\nl(f \u0304l ) :=\n\nd\nX\n\nf \u0304l (i),\n\ni=1\n\ndl\n\n \u0304\n\nand \u03c6dl acts on Ff \u0304l as p d l(fl ) \u03c3 dl . Let\np Ff \u0304l\n\n\b\n:= x \u2208 Ff \u0304l |\u03c3 dl (x) = x .\n419\n\n\fIt is a well known fact that p Ff \u0304l is a W (Fpdl )-free submodule of Ff \u0304l such that Ff \u0304l =\np Ff \u0304l \u2297W (F dl ) W (k(v)) (for instance, this follows easily from [Bo2, Prop. of p. 30] applied\np\n\nover B(Fpdl ) to Ff \u0304l [ p1 ]).\n4.1.2. Proposition. The filtered \u03c3-crystal (M, F 1 , \u03c6) is cyclic diagonalizable.\nProof: We choose arbitrarily a W (Fpdl )-basis {ls |s \u2208 Jl } of p Ff \u0304l , \u2200l \u2208 I\u03c6\u0304 . We view\nit as a W (k(v))-basis of Ff \u0304l . For any cyclic permutation \u03c6\u0304l of length \u2265 2 (i.e. for when\nwe deal with an l \u2208 I\u03c6\u03041 ) and for every element f \u0304 \u2208 L associated to \u03c6\u0304l but different from\nf \u0304l , let j \u2208 N be the smallest number such that f \u0304 = \u03c6\u0304j (f \u0304l ). We get a W (k(v))-basis of Ff \u0304\nby taking pe1jl of the images of \u03c6j (ls ), s \u2208 Jl , with\nj\nX\n\nejl :=\n\nf \u0304l (i).\n\ni=1\n\nThis expression of ejl 's is a consequence of the following iterating formula:\n(IT )\n\nj\n\n\u03c6 =\n\nj\nY\n\n1 \u0001\n\u03c3 m (\u03bc( )) \u03c3 j ,\np\nm=1\n\nwhere \u03c3 m (\u03bc) := \u03c3 m \u25e6 \u03bc( p1 ) \u25e6 \u03c3 \u2212m , \u2200m \u2208 Z.\nWith respect to the W (k(v))-basis of M obtained by putting together the chosen\nW (k(v))-bases of Ff \u0304, f \u0304 \u2208 L, (M, F 1 , \u03c6) gets the desired cyclic diagonalizable form. This\nends the proof of the Proposition.\n4.1.2.1. Remark. By very definition (see 2.2.22 1)) the Shimura filtered \u03c3-crystal\n(M, F 1 , \u03c6, TW (k(v))) is strongly cyclic diagonalizable.\n4.1.2.2. Remark. For what follows we refer to D and I of 2.2.22 3). All classification\nand standard invariants of (the extension to F) of C(f,v) are encoded in the permutation\n\u03c6\u0304 of L. For instance, the cyclic length is the maximum of the dl 's numbers, while the\nskeleton length is equal to |I\u03c6\u0304 |. In particular, the associated formal sum to this extension\nis of the form\nX X\nmf,v (\u03c4q )\u03c4q .\nq\u2208N; q|d \u03c4q \u2208Tq\n\n4.1.3. Example. L has 2 elements iff \u03c4 is an ordinary type or a supersingular type,\ni.e. iff d = 1 or if d = 2 and (M, \u03c6) does not have integral slopes.\n4.1.4. Proposition. The Shimura filtered \u03c3-crystal\nLie(GZp ) \u2297Zp W (k(v)), \u03c6, F 0(Lie(GW (k(v)) )), F 1 (Lie(GW (k(v)) ))\nand its adjoint are cyclic diagonalizable and of Borel type.\n420\n\n\u0001\n\n\fProof: The fact that the mentioned two Shimura filtered Lie \u03c3-crystals are of Borel\ntype results from the fact that \u03c6(Lie(BW (k(v)) )) \u2282 Lie(BW (k(v)) ) (we recall that B is a\nBorel subgroup of GZp ). The proof of their cyclic diagonalizability is entirely analogous\nto the proof of 4.1.2 (we just have to deal with functions from S(1, d) to S(\u22121, 1)), and\nso it is omitted.\nAbove we \u0001wrote Lie(GZp ) \u2297Zp W (k(v)) instead of Lie(GW (k(v)) ) just to emphasize\nhow \u03c6 = \u03c3\u03bc p1 acts on it: \u03c3 fixes Lie(GZp ) and acts as the Frobenius automorphism on\n\u0001\nW (k(v)), while \u03bc p1 acts via inner conjugation.\n\n4.1.4.1. Remark. We assume B contains T ; let B opp be the opposite of B w.r.t.\nopp\nT . As \u03c6 takes Lie(TW (k(v)) ) and Lie(BW (k(v))) into themselves, p\u03c6 takes Lie(BW\n(k(v)) )\ninto itself.\n4.1.5. \u03c9's types. Let N be the normalizer of T in GZp . Let\nWG := (N/T ) W (k(v))\n\n\u0001\n\nbe the Weyl group of GW (F) w.r.t. TW (F) . It depends only on Gad\nC and not on v. For\n\u03c9 \u2208 WG , let g\u03c9 \u2208 N (W (F)) be such that its image in WG is \u03c9. Let\n1\nC\u03c9 := (M \u2297W (k(v)) W (F), F 1 \u2297W (k(v)) W (F), g\u03c9 (\u03c3\u03bc( ) \u2297 1), GW (F) )\np\nbe the Shimura filtered \u03c3\u0304-crystal defined by g\u03c9 . We denote by P\u03c9 (resp. by LieG (P\u03c9 ))\nthe Newton polygon of C\u03c9 (resp. of the Shimura Lie \u03c3-crystal attached to C\u03c9 ). Let \u03c4\u03c9\nbe the formal isogeny type of C\u03c9 ; we refer to it as the \u03c9's type associated to (or defined\nby) (f, L(p) , v); if \u03c9 is the identity element of WG , we regain the Shimura-ordinary type\nof 4.1.1. We have the following extension of 4.1.2 and 4.1.4.\n4.1.5.1. Proposition. C\u03c9 is cyclic diagonalizable, its attached Shimura (adjoint)\nfiltered Lie \u03c3-crystal is cyclic diagonalizable; moreover it (and so also P\u03c9 and LieG (P\u03c9 ))\ndepends only on \u03c9 and not on the choice of g\u03c9 .\nProof: The proof of the cyclic diagonalizability of C\u03c9 or of its attached Shimura\nfiltered (adjoint) Lie \u03c3-crystal is entirely analogous to the proof of 4.1.2, and so it is\nomitted. The cyclic diagonalizability results as well from 2.2.16, once we remark (cf.\nFact of 2.2.9 1)) that (M \u2297W (k(v)) W (F), F 1 \u2297W (k(v)) W (F), g\u03c9 (\u03c3\u03bc( p1 ) \u2297 1), TW (F) ) is a\nShimura filtered \u03c3-crystal; so the last part of the Proposition is a very particular case of\n3.11.1 c). This ends the proof.\n4.1.5.2. Remark. In 4.1.5-6, instead of F, we can work as well with the smallsp\nest finite field extension k(vG\n) of k(v) over which Gk(v) splits; warning: in general, in\nconnection to 4.1.5.1 we have to replace accordingly the wording cyclic diagonalizable by\n\"potentially cyclic diagonalizable\".\n4.1.5.3. Degrees of definitions. Let d\u03c9 be the degree of definition of C\u03c9 . The\nset SDD(f, v) of all d\u03c9 's is precisely the set SDD(M \u2297W (k(v)) W (F), \u03c3\u03bc( p1 ) \u2297 1, GW (F) )\n421\n\n\fdefined in Problem 2 of 2.2.22 H. If GZp is a split group, then SDD(f, v) is a subset of\nthe set of orders of elements of WG (cf. 4.1.5.2). From 3.11.3.1 we get that d|d\u03c9 .\n4.1.5.4. Simple properties. Let \u03c3\u03c9 := g\u03c9 \u03c3\u0304. It is a \u03c3\u0304-linear automorphism of M \u2297W (k(v)) W (F). We have g\u03c9 (\u03c3\u03bc( p1 ) \u2297 1) = \u03c3\u03c9 \u03bcW (F) ( p1 ). The canonical split of C\u03c9 is \u03bcW (F) itself (cf. the proof of 4.1.5.1 and the Corollary of 2.2.9\n3)). The elements of M \u2297W (k(v)) W (F) fixed by \u03c3\u03c9 give birth to a Zp -structure\nof (M \u2297W (k(v)) W (F), GW (F), (v\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J \u2032 ): from Lang's theorem we get it is precisely\n(L\u2217p , GZp , (v\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J \u2032 ). We deduce (cf. 2.2.9 8) applied to (M \u2297W (k(v)) W (F), F 1 \u2297W (k(v))\nW (F), g\u03c9 (\u03c3\u03bc( p1 ) \u2297 1), TW (F))) that (C\u03c9 , (v\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J \u2032 ) is 1J \u2032 -isomorphic to the extension to\nF of a strongly cyclic diagonalizable Shimura filtered F -crystal over Fpd\u03c9\n1\n(M \u2297 W (Fpd\u03c9 ), F\u03c91 , \u03c3Fpd\u03c9 \u03bc\u03c9 ( ), GW (Fpd\u03c9 ) , (v\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J \u2032 )),\np\nwhere \u03bc\u03c9 is a cocharacter of GW (Fpd\u03c9 ) such that [\u03bc\u03c9 ] = [\u03bcW (Fpd\u03c9 ) ] and where F\u03c91 is the\nmaximal W (Fpd\u03c9 )-submodule of M \u2297 W (Fpd\u03c9 ) on which \u03bc\u03c9 acts as the inverse of the\nidentity character of Gm ; its canonical split cocharacter is \u03bc\u03c9 . The main property of \u03bc\u03c9\nis (cf. the cylic diagonalizability; see also Exercise of 2.2.22 1)):\nFact. It commutes with \u03c3Fs\n\npd\u03c9\n\n\u03bc\u03c9 \u03c3F\u2212sd , \u2200s \u2208 N.\np \u03c9\n\nLet T\u03bc\u03c9 be the smallest torus of GZp through which \u03bc\u03c9 factors. Let T \u03c9 be a maximal\ntorus of GZp containing it.\nExercise. Let \u03c91 , \u03c92 \u2208 WG . Show that (C\u03c91 , (v\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J \u2032 ) and (C\u03c92 , (v\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J \u2032 ) are\n1J \u2032 -isomorphic, iff the extensions to W (F) of \u03bc\u03c91 and \u03bc\u03c92 are GZp (Zp )-conjugate (and\nnot only GZp (W (F))-conjugate), i.e. iff the extensions to F of \u03bc\u03c91 and \u03bc\u03c92 are GZp (Fp )conjugate. Hint: an 1J \u2032 -isomorphism between (C\u03c91 , (v\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J \u2032 ) and (C\u03c92 , (v\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J \u2032 ) must\npreserve their canonical lifts, i.e. it is given by an element of the centralizer of the image\nof \u03bcW (F) in GW (F) .\n4.1.5.5. The Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Hasse\u2013Witt relation. Let RG (v) be the equivalence relation on WG defined by: \u03c91 , \u03c92 \u2208 WG are in relation RG (v), iff the Faltings\u2013\nShimura\u2013Hasse\u2013Witt adjoint maps of C\u03c91 and C\u03c92 are isomorphic, under an isomorphism\ndefined by an element of Gad\nZp (F).\n4.1.6. The minimal model. We view the alternating form \u03c8\u0303 of 2.3.1 also as a\nperfect alternating form \u03c8\u0303 : M \u2297W (k(v)) M \u2192 W (k(v))(1). So\nMM := (M, F 1 , \u03c6, GW (k(v)) , (v\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J \u2032 , \u03c8\u0303)\nis a principally quasi-polarized Shimura filtered \u03c3-crystal. From 4.1.4, as in 3.4.3.0, we\nget (cf. also 3.11.6 B)) that its attached Shimura filtered Lie \u03c3-crystal is of parabolic\ntype. From 3.1.0 a) we get that it is a Shimura-canonical lift. The cocharacter \u03bc is the\ncanonical split of (M, \u03c6, GW (k(v))) (cf. the proof of Fact 2 of 4.1.1.1 and 3.1.5). From the\nvery definitions of 3.11.2 B we get that MM is the minimal model of its extension to F.\n422\n\n\f4.2. G-ordinary points.\n4.2.1. Theorem. There is a G(Apf )-invariant, open, dense subscheme U of Nk(v)\nsuch that for any point y : Spec(k) \u2192 Nk(v) we have:\na) \u03c4 is the formal isogeny type of the Shimura \u03c3k -crystal attached to it (cf. 2.3.10)\niff it factors through U;\nb) LieG (\u03c4 ) is the formal isogeny type of the Shimura Lie \u03c3k -crystal attached to it (cf.\n2.3.10) iff it factors through U;\nc) the Shimura \u03c3k -crystal attached to it is Shimura-ordinary iff y factors through U.\nProof: Let V0 := W (F). Let NV0 := N \u00d7O(v) V0 and let NF be its special fibre. Let\ny0 : Spec(F) \u0592\u2192 NF be a closed point and let z0 : Spec(V0 ) \u0592\u2192 NV0 be a lift of it. Let NF0\nbe the connected component of NF containing y0 .\n\u0001\nLet (A0 , pA0 ) := z0\u2217 (A, PA ). Let M0 , F01 , \u03c60 , GV0 , (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J \u2032 , pA0 be the principally quasi-polarized Shimura filtered \u03c3\u0304-crystal attached to z0 . So (cf. 2.3.10) M0 :=\n1\nHdR\n(A0 /V0 ), F01 is its Hodge filtration defined by A0 and (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J \u2032 is the family of de\nRham components of the family (w\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J \u2032 of Hodge cycles with which A0 is (cf. 2.3.3)\nnaturally endowed. From 2.3.13.1 we deduce that for any point z1 : Spec(V0 ) \u0592\u2192 NV0\nlifting an F-valued point y1 of NF0 ,\u0001 the Shimura filtered \u03c3\u0304-crystal attached to it is of\nthe form M0 , F01 , \u03c61 , GV0 , (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J \u2032 . We have \u03c61 = g1 \u03c60 , with g1 \u2208 GV0 (V0 ) (cf. the\nbeginning of \u00a73). From 2.3.16 we get:\n(4.2.1.1) For any F-valued point \u1e211 of a non-empty open subscheme of GF , there is\ng1 \u2208 GV0 (V0 ) lifting it and there is z1 \u2208 NV0 (V0 ) lifting a y1 \u2208 NF0 (F) for which we have\n\u03c61 = g1 \u03c60 .\nLet U0 (resp. U1 ) be the open subscheme of NF0 of whose geometric points have\nthe smallest Newton polygon of their attached Shimura F -crystals (resp. Shimura Lie\nF -crystals). U0 and U1 exist, cf. the specialization theorem.\nAs all \u03c3\u0304-crystals (M0 , g1 \u03c60 ), with g1 \u2208 GV0 (V0 ), give birth to 1/2-symmetric isocrystals we get:\n(4.2.2) The fact that the \u03c3\u0304-crystal (M0 , \u03c60 ) attached to the point y0 \u2208 NF0 (F) has\nthe smallest Newton polygon among all \u03c3\u0304-crystals attached \u0001to F-valued points of NF0 ,\nis equivalent to the fact that the Lie \u03c3\u0304-crystal \u0001 End(M0 ), \u03c60 has the smallest Newton\npolygon among all Lie \u03c3\u0304-crystals End(M0 ), \u03c61 defined naturally by \u03c3\u0304-crystals attached\nto F-valued points of NF0 .\n\u0001\nSo, as the\u0001 Newton polygon of End(M0 ), \u03c61 is obtained from the Newton\npolygon of\n\u0001\nLie(GV0 ), \u03c61 and from the Newton polygon\n\u0001 of End(M0 )/Lie(GV0 ), \u03c61 , U0 is an open\nsubscheme of U1 . End(M0 )/Lie(GV0 ), \u03c61 is not a Lie \u03c3\u0304-crystal; but the quadruple\nEnd(M0 )/Lie(GV0 ), F00 (End(M0 ))/F00 (Lie(GV0 )), F01 (End(M0 ))/F01 (Lie(GV0 )), \u03c61\nis a p-divisible object of MF[\u22121,1] (V0 ).\n423\n\n\u0001\n\n\f4.2.3. The use of Fontaine's comparison theory. In what follows we refer to\n[Va2, \u00a75]. Loc. cit. was worked out under the condition (*) of [Va2, 5.1]. Such a condition\nis not necessarily satisfied in the context of our SHS (f, L(p) , v) (cf. 2.3.8 1)). However,\nits role was just to reach to a reductive context as of 2.3.4 and 2.3.11 (see [Va2, 5.2.12]).\nSo below we refer to parts of [Va2, \u00a75] without any extra comment. Let K0 := V0 [ p1 ].\nIt is known that there is a K0 -isomorphism\n1\n \u0303 0 \u2297V0 K0\nH\u00e9t\n(A0K0 , Qp ) \u2297Qp K0 \u2192M\n\ntaking the p-component of the \u00e9tale component u\u03b1 of w\u03b1 into t\u03b1 , \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 J \u2032 , and taking\n1\n\u03c8\u0303 into pA0 (cf.

But H\u00e9t\n(A0K0 , Qp ) and the family of ten\u0001\n1\nsors (u\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J \u2032 of T H\u00e9t (A0K0 , Qp ) can be respectively identified (non-canonically) with\nL\u2217p \u2297Zp Qp and the family of tensors (v\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J \u2032 of T (L\u2217p \u2297Zp Qp ) (cf. [Va2, top of p. 473]).\nSo we get a K0 -isomorphism\n\u03c10 : M \u2297W (k(v)) K0 \u2192M\n \u0303 0 \u2297V0 K0\ntaking v\u03b1 into t\u03b1 , \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 J \u2032 , and taking \u03c8\u0303 into pA0 .\nThe isomorphism \u03c10 allows us to identify the extension from B(k(v)) to K0 of the \u03c3linear automorphism \u03c6 of M [ p1 ] defined in 4.1, with a \u03c3\u0304-linear automorphism of M0 \u2297V0 K0 .\nSo we have \u03c6 \u2297 1 = g\u0303\u03c60 , with g\u0303 \u2208 G0 (K0 ). There is a cocharacter \u03bc0 : Gm \u2192 GV0\nwhich produces a direct sum decomposition M0 = F01 \u2295 F00 , with \u03b2 \u2208 Gm (V0 ) acting\nthrough \u03bc on F0i as the multiplication with \u03b2 \u2212i (cf. 2.3.10); under extension via an O(v) monomorphism V0 \u0592\u2192 C, \u03bc0 becomes G(C)-conjugate to the cocharacters \u03bc\u2217x , x \u2208 X. As\nGK0 is a split group, \u03bc0 and \u03bcK0 are in fact GV0 (K0 )-conjugate. So we can assume\n\u03c10 (F 1 \u2297W (k(v)) K0 ) = F01 \u2297V0 K0 .\n4.2.3.1. The case of a torus. We first consider the case when G is a torus. NV0\nas a scheme is a disjoint union of copies of Spec(V0 ), cf. [Va2, 3.2.8]. These copies are\npermuted transitively by G(Apf ), cf. [Va2, 3.3.1-2]. So taking U = Nk(v) , we just have\nto show that the formal isogeny type of the \u03c3\u0304-crystal attached to y0 is \u03c4 . This is well\nknown (for instance, this is implicitly contained in [Ko1, \u00a72]). However, we recall one\nway to prove this, using the language of this paper. As (M0 , F01 , \u03c60 , GV0 ) is a cyclic\ndiagonalizable Shimura filtered \u03c3\u0304-crystal (see 2.2.16), as in 4.1.1.1 we get that its formal\nisogeny type can be computed from the way \u03c6s0 's, s \u2208 N, act on \u03bc0 (as G is a torus, \u03bc0 is\nuniquely determined, cf. Corollary of 2.2.9 3)). But from the identifications of 4.2.3 we\nget: this way is the same as the way \u03c3\u0304 s 's, s \u2208 N, act on \u03bcK0 . This proves 4.2.1 in the\ncase when G is a torus.\nFrom now on we assume G is not a torus.\n4.2.4. Some simplifications. We got 2 particular hyperspecial subgroups of\u0001\nG(K0 ) : GV0 (V0 ) (defined via the V0 -lattice M0 of M0 \u2297V0 K0 ) and GZ(p) M \u2297W (k(v)) V0\n424\n\n\f(defined via the V0 -lattice M \u2297W (k(v)) V0 of M \u2297W (k(v)) K0 ). But any two hyperspecial\nsubgroups of G(K0 ) are conjugate by an element g0 \u2208 Gad (K0 ) (cf. [Ti2, p. 47]). Changing the Shimura adjoint filtered Lie \u03c3\u0304-crystal attached to z0 by the inner\n\u0001 automorphism\n\u0001\u0001\n\u2032\n0\nad\n1\nad\ndefined by g0 , it can be put in the form Lie(Gad\n),\n\u03c6\n,\nF\nLie(G\n)\n0\n0\nV0\nV0 , F0 Lie(GV0 ) ,\nwhere \u03c6\u20320 = g(\u03c6 \u2297 1), with g \u2208 Gad\nV0 (K0 ). Warning: here, in accordance with the original\nad\nnotation GZ(p) (of 2.3.1), GV0 is w.r.t. the second hyperspecial subgroup; we had no\nreason to write Lie(GZp ) \u2297Zp V0 instead of Lie(Gad\nV0 ).\nAs \u03bc and \u03bc0 are GV0 (K0 )-conjugate, changing everything by an isomorphism (defined by an element of Gad\nIwasawa's decomposition of [Ti2, 3.3.2]), we can\nV0 (V0 ), cf. \u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n0\nad\n0\nad\n1\nad\nassume F0 Lie(GV0 ) = F Lie(GV0 ) and F01 Lie(Gad\nV0 ) = F Lie(GV0 ) . As g norad\nad\nmalizes Lie(Gad\nV0 ) and as GV0 (V0 ) is that maximal bounded subgroup of GV0 (K0 ) (being\na hyperspecial subgroup of it, see [Ti2, 3.2]) normalizing Lie(GV0 ), g \u2208 Gad\nV0 (V0 ). So\n(Lie(GV0 ), g(\u03c6 \u2297 1)) is as well the Shimura Lie \u03c3\u0304-crystal attached to y0 .\nThis last fact allows us, via the first sentence of 3.5.5, to appeal to the results of\n3.1-3, 3.6.6 and 3.4.\n4.2.5. The use of (4.2.1.1). (4.2.1.1) implies: there is a non-empty open subscheme U of Gad\nF with the property that for any element \u1e210 \u2208 U (F), there is a V0 -valued\npoint of NV0 lifting an F-valued point of NF0 and such that its attached Shimura adjoint\nfiltered Lie \u03c3\u0304-crystal is isomorphic to\n\u0001 1\n\u0001\u0001\n0\nad\nad\nlg1 := Lie(Gad\nV0 ), g1 g(\u03c6 \u2297 1), F Lie(GV0 ) , F Lie(GV0 ) ,\nwith g1 mod p equal to \u1e210 .\n\n4.2.6. The definition of UF \u2229 NF0 . Now 4.2.1 for NF0 is a direct consequence of\n4.1.1.4, 4.2.5, 3.2.5, 3.4.3.0, 3.4.11, 3.4.13, 3.5.5, 3.6.6, 3.7.2 and 4.2.7 below. We present\nthe details. From \u00a73 and 4.1 we need:\na) The fact (see\n\u0001 4.1.4) that the Shimura (adjoint) filtered Lie \u03c3-crystal attached to\nM, F 1 , \u03c6, GW (k(v)) is of Borel type.\n\u0001\nb) 3.4.11 and 3.6.6 applied to the extension to F of M, F 1 , \u03c6, GW (k(v)) . We get (via\n3.5.5 1) and 2)) that there is a Zariski dense set L of F-valued points of Gad\nV0 such that lg1\nis (see 3.11.6.1) Shimura-ordinary and has the same Newton polygon as (Lie(Gad\nV0 ), \u03c6\u22971),\nad\n\u2200g1 \u2208 GV0 (V0 ) lifting an element of L.\nc) As the intersection U (F) \u2229 L is non-empty, from b) and 4.2.5 we get that there\nare F-valued points of NF0 whose attached Shimura Lie \u03c3\u0304-crystals are Shimura-ordinary\n\u0001\nand have LieG (\u03c4 ) as their formal isogeny type; we recall that Lie\nZ(G\n)\ncontributes\nV\n0\n\u0001\nad\nonly with slopes 0 to the formal isogeny type of Lie(GV0 ), g1 \u03c60 , \u2200g1 \u2208 GV0 (V0 ).\nd) The first sentence of 3.2.5 (applied to the class Cl(M0 , \u03c60 , GV0 )) which together\nwith c) implies that the F-valued points of U1 have LieG (\u03c4 ) as the formal isogeny type of\ntheir attached Shimura Lie \u03c3\u0304-crystals. The role of (g, \u03c60 ) in 3.2.5 is that of a Shimuraordinary Lie \u03c3-crystal (attached to a Shimura-ordinary \u03c3-crystal), cf. 3.4.3.0, end of 3.5.5\nand 3.7.2 (see also 3.11.6 A) and B)).\n425\n\n\fe) The second sentence of 3.2.5 (applied to Cl(M0 , \u03c60 , GV0 )) which (together with\nthe fact that U0 is an open subscheme of U1 ) implies U0 = U1 .\nIt is worth pointing out that in fact the use of 3.6.6 can be avoided, cf. 3.4.14. To\ndefine U it is enough to define UF . We take UF \u2229 NF0 to be U1 = U0 . From 3.1.0 a) and\nc) (applied to Cl(M0 , \u03c60 , GV0 )) and c) we also get that the Shimura \u03c3\u0304-crystal attached\nto an F-valued point of NF0 is Shimura-ordinary iff it factors through U1 .\n4.2.7. A claim. The fact that the F-valued points of U1 give birth to Shimuraordinary \u03c3\u0304-crystals having precisely \u03c4 as their formal isogeny type results from the following Claim:\nClaim. Under the isomorphism \u03c10 of 4.2.3, the slopes of (M, \u03c6) together with their\nmultiplicities, and the slopes of the Shimura \u03c3\u0304-crystal attached to an element of U1 (F)\ntogether with their multiplicities, are computed using p-adic valuations of the eigenvalues\n(and their multiplicities) of two semisimple elements s1 and respectively s2 of GK0 (K0 )\nwhich are Gad\nV0 (K0 )-conjugate, and so when viewed as semisimple elements of GV0 (K0 )\nare GV0 (K0 )-conjugate. Here eigenvalues are computed as endomorphisms of M0 \u2297V0 K0 .\nProof: As the homomorphism GV0 (K0 ) \u2192 Gad\nV0 (K0 ) is surjective, we just have to\nad\ndeal with the GV0 (K0 )-conjugacy part. For being able to use the previous notations,\nwe assume y0 factors through U1 . A sufficiently high power n of \u03c6 (resp. of \u03c60 ) acts\ndiagonally w.r.t. a W (F)-basis of M \u2297W (k(v)) W (F) (resp. of M0 ), producing (for instance,\nvia 3.11.2 B or 2.2.24.1) a semisimple element s1 (resp. s2 ) of GK0 (K0 ) (we use the\nidentification of 4.2.3 achieved by \u03c10 ). Choosing n big enough and a positive, integral\nmultiple of d[kA0 : Fp ], where kA0 is the finite field such that A0 and its family of Hodge\ncycles (w\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J \u2032 are defined over W (kA0 ), we can define such semisimple elements without\nreferring to 3.11.2 B or to 2.2.24.1, cf. 2.2.24.\nIn what follows it is irrelevant if we use 3.11.2 B (equivalently 2.2.24.1) or 2.2.24 in\norder to define them provided, in case we define them via 2.2.24, we allow such semisimple\nelements to be replaced by a product of them with elements of GV0 (V0 ) which do not\nchange the p-adic valuations of the eigenvalues involved. However, to be short we assume\ns1 and s2 are defined via 3.11.2 B.\nAs the cocharacter of Gab\nK0 obtained by composing \u03bcK0 with the natural epimorphism\nab\nmqu : GK0 \u0589 GK0 , is the same as the one obtained by composing \u03bc0 with mqu (as \u03bcK0\nand \u03bc0 are GK0 (K0 )-conjugate), the images of s1 and s2 in Gab\nK0 (K0 ) are the same (cf.\nthe constructions in 3.11.2 B and 4.2.3).\nad\nMoreover, we can assume that the images of s1 and s2 in Gad\nK0 (K0 ) are GK0 (K0 )conjugate: this is a consequence of 4.2.6 b) and c) and of 3.11.6 A) (cf. also 4.2.5). So\nder\nsq1 and sq2 are Gad\n\u2192 Gad . This\nK0 (K0 )-conjugate. Here q is the order of the isogeny G\nproves the Claim.\n\n4.2.8. End of the proof. The formal isogeny types \u03c4 and LieG (\u03c4 ) depend only\non f and v. So what we got for NF0 remains true for all other connected components of\nNF . So (cf. also 4.2.6-7) the subscheme U of Nk(v) defined by 4.2.1 a) exists and is open,\n426\n\n\fis also defined by 4.2.1 b), and it is dense in Nk(v) . Moreover, from the end of 4.2.6, we\nalso get that 4.2.1 c) holds. From Fact 6 of 2.3.11 we get that U is G(Apf )-invariant. This\nends the proof of 4.2.1.\nAnother way of passing from one connected component of NF to all others is to use\nthe following fact:\n4.2.8.1.* Fact. The connected components of NF are permuted transitively by G(Apf )\n(cf. [Va2, 3.3.2] and the existence \u2013see [Va3]\u2013 of smooth toroidal compactifications of N ).\nWarning: If (G, X) is of compact type, then this Fact is a consequence of 2.3.3.1 and\nof [Va2, 3.3.2].\n4.2.9. Definition. The points of Uk(v) (resp. of Uk(v) /H\u03030 ) with values in fields are\ncalled G-ordinary (or GW (k(v)) -ordinary or Shimura-ordinary) points of Nk(v) (resp. of\nNk(v) /H\u03030 ). Here H\u03030 is an arbitrary compact (not necessarily open) subgroup of G(Apf ).\n4.2.10. Corollary. The Lie algebra underlying the Shimura adjoint Lie \u03c3k -crystal\nLIE attached to a k-valued point of Nk(v) is naturally identified, up to inner isomorphisms\nad\n(defined by elements of Gad\nW (k) (W (k)), with Lie(GW (k) ). Under this identification, we\nhave:\n\u2013 the automorphism class (see 2.2.11) of LIE is given by the \u03c3k -linear Lie automorad\nad\nphism of Lie(Gad\nW (k) ) = Lie(GZp ) \u2297Zp W (k) acting trivially on Lie(GZp );\n\u2013 the filtration class (see 2.2.11.1) of LIE is defined by F 0 (Lie(Gad\nZp ) \u2297Zp W (k)) (i.e.\nis defined by the composite of \u03bcW (k) with the epimorphism GW (k) \u2192 Gad\nW (k) ).\nProof: This is nothing else but 4.2.5 (or 4.2.4). The fact that we can assume k is\njust perfect is implied by the convention 2.3.9.2 and so by the fact that GW (k) is split; so\nthe isomorphism \u03c10 of 4.2.3 exists as well in this case (as it can be checked using standard\nproperties of the Galois cohomology).\n4.3. Cyclic factors and (refined) Lie stable p-ranks.\n4.3.1. Cyclic factors. In what follows we apply 3.9-10 to the context of 4.2. Let\nGad\nZp = \u00d7i\u2208H Gi\nbe the product decomposition of Gad\nZp in Zp -simple factors. So any Gi Qp is a Qp -simple,\nadjoint group. We consider a disjoint decomposition\nH = Hc \u222a Hnc\ndefined by: i \u2208 H belongs to Hc iff the composite \u03bc(i) of \u03bc with the natural epimorphism\nGW (k(v)) \u0589 GiW (k(v)) is trivial. H is the empty set iff dimC (X) = 0, i.e. iff G is a torus\n(cf. axiom [Va2, 2.3 (SV2)]).\nWe fix a point\ny : Spec(k) \u2192 Nk(v) .\n427\n\n\fThe Shimura adjoint Lie \u03c3k -crystal (Lie(Gad\nW (k) ), \u03c6y ) attached to it is a product\nY\n\ni\u2208H\n\n\u0001\nLie(Gi W (k) ), \u03c6y ,\n\neach simple factor of it being a cyclic Shimura adjoint Lie \u03c3k -crystal. In other words,\n\u2200i \u2208 H \u03c6y permutes (cyclically) transitively the Lie algebras of the B(k)-simple factors\nof Gi B(k) ; this is a consequence of 4.2.10 and of the fact that Gi is the Weil restriction\nof an absolutely simple, adjoint group over an unramified, finite extension of Zp . We call\nthese factors the cyclic adjoint factors attached to the point y; so in what follows we refer\nto the i-th cyclic adjoint factor attached to y as well as (cf. 3.9.1 and 3.9.6) to the i-th\nFaltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Hasse\u2013Witt (adjoint) shift or map attached to y. Similarly, let\n\u03c8\u0304(i) : Lie(Gik ) \u2192 Lie(Gik )\nbe the i-th Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Hasse\u2013Witt adjoint map of the extension of (M, \u03c6, GW (k(v)))\nto k. Based on 4.2.10, we always write the i-th Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Hasse\u2013Witt adjoint\nmap of y in the form gy \u03c8\u0304(i), with gy \u2208 Gi (k) acting on Lie(Gi k ) by inner conjugation;\naccordingly, by an inner isomorphism between two such i-th Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Hasse\u2013\nWitt adjoint maps attached to k-valued points of Nk(v) we always mean an isomorphism\ndefined by an element of Gi (k).\nWe also speak about the cyclic Lie factors attached to y (cf. def. 3.10.1). We\nnaturally extend this terminology to points z : Spec(W (k)) \u2192 N as well as to the\ncontext of the quotient N /H0 .\nWarning: in the context of points of N /H0 with values in perfect fields, the adjoint\ngroups whose Lie algebras are defining such cyclic factors are not necessarily products of\nabsolutely simple ones and so (at least theoretically) we have to work with the notion of\nweakly cyclic factors (cf. 3.10.0.1); in other words, referring to 2.3.10, we do not know\nwhen G\u0303ad\nW (k) is a product of adjoint groups, each one of them with the property that the\nLie algebras of simple factors of its extension to W (k\u0304) are permuted transitively by \u03c6.\n4.3.1.1. Notations and simple facts. We write\nGiW (k) = \u00d7ji \u2208Hi Gji ,\nwith Gji an absolutely simple, adjoint W (k)-group and with Hi a set of indices. So\nGad\nW (k) = \u00d7i\u2208H \u00d7ji \u2208Hi Gj = \u00d7l\u2208Ip (Gad ) Gl ,\nwhere Ip (Gad ) is the (disjoint) union of Hi , i \u2208 H. Ip (Gad ) does not depend on p (or\non k or y); however, it is appropriate to use the right lower index p in the definition of\nIp (Gad ).\n\u03c6y permutes the factors Lie(Gl ), l \u2208 Ip (Gad ), achieving a permutation \u03b3p (Gad ) of\nIp (Gad ); it does not depend on y, cf. 4.2.10. \u03b3p (Gad ) is a product of |H|-disjoint cyclic\n428\n\n\fpermutations \u03b3i (i \u2208 H), where \u03b3i is the cyclic permutation of Hi defined logically by\nthe action of \u03c6y on Lie(Gi B(k) ). For i \u2208 H, let\ndi := |Hi | \u2208 N.\nFrom the structure of simple, adjoint groups over fields (see [Ti1]) we get:\nGi = ResW (F\n\npdi\n\ni\n)/Zp G ,\n\nwith Gi an absolutely simple, adjoint W (Fpdi )-group.\nFor what follows we refer to 3.11.2-3.\nFact. The T -degree (resp., in case G is not a torus, the A-degree) of definition\nof any Shimura-ordinary \u03c3k\u0304 -crystal attached to a k\u0304-valued G-ordinary point of Nk(v) is\ndT := [k(v ab ) : Fp ] (resp. is dA := [k(v ad ) : Fp ]).\nProof: We have a logical variant of 4.2.3 for any morphism z : Spec(W (k)) \u2192 N ,\ncf. the proof of 4.2.10. So, not to introduce extra notations, we can assume k = F.\nThe part involving T -degrees is a consequence of their definition of 3.11.3 and of the\nGV0 (K0 )-conjugacy of the cocharacters \u03bcK0 and \u03bc0 of 4.2.3 (cf. also the definition of\nE(Gab , X ab )).\nThe A-degree of definition of (M, \u03c6, G) is [k(v ad ) : Fp ], as it can be checked easily\nstarting from very definitions (see Fact of 3.11.2 D and its logical adjoint version; see also\n[Mi3, 4.6-7]). So the part involving A-degrees results from 3.11.6 A) and 4.2.5-6 (see b)\nof 4.4.1 2) below for a second approach). This ends the proof.\nFor i \u2208 Hnc , let k(vi ) be the subfield of k(v) such that B(k(vi )) is the field of\ndefinition of the Gi (B(k(v)))-conjugacy class of \u03bc(i)B(k(v)) (the initial group being GiQp ).\nFor i \u2208 Hnc , we define as in 2.2.16.5 and 3.11.3, an A-degree of definition\ndA (i) := [k(vi ) : Fp ].\nAs in the above proof, it is the A-degree of definition of the i-th cyclic adjoint factor\nattached to any k\u0304-valued G-ordinary point of Nk(v) .\nIf G is a torus, it is convenient to define dA := 1. So always dA is the least common\nmultiple of dA (i), i \u2208 Hnc , while d = [dA , dT ]. We refer to dA (i) as the i-th A-degree\nof definition of (the Shimura-ordinary type produced by) the SHS (f, L(p) , v). We also\ndenote dA (resp. dT ) by dA (v) (resp. by dT (v)).\n4.3.1.2. Different invariants. We denote by Ry (resp. by Ryr ) the Lie (resp. the\nrefined Lie) stable p-rank of (Lie(Gad\nW (k) , \u03c6y ) (cf. 3.9.1, 3.9.1.1, 3.9.4 and 3.9.6). We refer\nto it as the Lie (resp. the refined Lie) stable p-rank of y.\nWe denote by R(\u03c4 ) (resp. Rr (\u03c4 )) the Lie (resp. the refined\nLie) stable p-rank of the\n\u0001\nShimura adjoint Lie \u03c3-crystal attached to M, \u03c6, GW (k(v)) of 4.1.1.2.\n429\n\n\fFor i \u2208 Hnc , we denote by \u03b5i (v ad ) (resp. by ai (v ad )) the \u03b5-type (resp. the a-invariant)\nof the i-th cyclic adjoint factor of the extension of C(f,v) to F (cf. 3.10.4 and 3.10.8.1).\nThe concentrated \u03b5-type of \u03b5i (v ad ) is denoted by \u03b5ci (v ad ) (see 3.10.5.1). Let\na(v ad ) :=\n\nX\n\nai (v ad ).\n\ni\u2208Hnc\n\nWe refer to it as the a-invariant of (f, L(p) , v).\nFor i \u2208 Hnc , let\nDi+ (v ad )\n(resp. Di\u2212 (v ad )) be the positive (resp. negative) p-divisible group of the i-th cyclic adjoint\nfactor of the extension of C(f,v) to F (cf. 3.11.6.2 2)).\n4.3.2. The refined a-invariant. Ry is a non-negative integer. Fixing a bijection\nfH : H\u2192S(1,\n \u0303\n|H|),\nRyr is a sequence of non-negative integers, indexed by elements of S(1, |H|). These elements \"count\" the Qp -simple factors of Gad\nQp . The n-th number of the sequence is the Lie\n\u0001\nstable p-rank of the cyclic Shimura adjoint Lie \u03c3k -crystal Lie(Gf \u22121 (n) ) \u2297Zp W (k), \u03c6y\nH\n\ndivided by df \u22121 (n) (here n \u2208 S(1, |H|)). For i \u2208 Hc , let ai (v ad ) := 0. Let\nH\n\n\u0001\nar (v ad ) := af \u22121 (1) (v ad ), ..., af \u22121(|H|) (v ad ) ;\nH\n\nH\n\nwe refer to it as the refined a-invariant of (f, L(p) , v).\n4.3.3. Remark. The set SLSp \u2212 rk(N(k(v)) ) of Lie stable p-ranks of geometric\npoints of Nk(v) is not necessarily a set of consecutive non-negative integers. For instance,\nif N = M the set of values of such Lie stable p-ranks is {1, 3, 6, . . . , e(e+1)\n} (we recall\n2\nthat dimQ (W ) = 2e).\n4.3.4. Theorem. The following statements are equivalent:\na) y factors through U;\nb) Ry = R(\u03c4 );\nc) Ryr = Rr (\u03c4 ).\nProof: This is a direct consequence of 3.9.2, 3.9.4, 4.2.1 and 4.2.4, applied to any\nconnected component of NF (cf. also 3.9.6).\n4.3.5. Corollary. R(\u03c4 ) (resp. Rr (\u03c4 )) is the greatest number (resp. the greatest\nsequence) among all numbers R\u1ef9 (resp. among all sequences of numbers R\u1ef9r ) associated\nto points \u1ef9 \u2208 Nk(v) (k\u0303)) (with k\u0303 a perfect field).\nProof: This is a consequence of 4.2.1 c), 4.2.4 and 3.9.5.\n430\n\n\f4.3.6. Corollary. Nk(v) \\U is of pure codimension 1 in Nk(v) .\nProof: The proof of this is entirely analogous to the one in the case of the ordinary\nlocus of Mk(v) . If dimC (X) = 0, then the Corollary is obvious: we have U = Nk(v) (cf.\n4.2.3.1). We assume now dimC (X) \u2265 1. 4.3.4-5 assure us (to be compared also with 4.3.7\nbelow) that Nk(v) \\U is of pure codimension 1, if it is non void.\nTo see that Nk(v) \\U is non void, we first treat the case when N has the completion\nproperty, just to emphasize how 3.6.15 A can be applied in practice. So, assuming\nthat k = k\u0304 and that N has the completion property, the fact that Nk(v) \\U is non void\ncan be checked, by just remarking: If (My , Fz1 , \u03c6y , GW (k) ) is the Shimura-canonical lift\nof the Shimura \u03c3k -crystal (My , \u03c6y , GW (k) ) attached to a G-ordinary point y \u2208 U(k),\nthen Fz1 (Lie(GW (k) ) 6= {0} (corresponding to the fact dimC (X) > 0) and there is g \u2208\nG0W (k) (W (k)) such that (My , g\u03c6y , GW (k) ) is not a GW (k) -ordinary \u03c3k -crystal.\n\u0001\nTo argue this let l0 \u2208 Ip (Gad ) be such that Fz1 Lie(Gl0 ) 6= 0. Let T , B and B opp\nbe as in 4.1.4.1. Let \u03c9 \u2208 G0W (k) (W (k)) normalizing TW (k) and such that wBW (k) w\u22121 =\nopp\nBW\n(k) .\nWe can assume that BW (k) normalizes Fz1 and that \u03c6y takes Lie(TW (k) ) and\nLie(B) \u2297Zp W (k) into themselves (cf. 3.2.3 and either 3.6.15 A or 3.11.1 \u0001c)). The Lie\nstable p-rank of the cyclic Shimura adjoint Lie \u03c3k -crystal Lie(Gi W (k) ), \u03c9\u03c6y (with i \u2208 H\nsuch that Gl0 \u2282 GiW (k) ) is 0. So (My , \u03c9\u03c6y , GW (k) ) is not a GW (k) -ordinary \u03c3k -crystal,\ncf. F4 of 3.10.7.\nTo treat the general case, we use special quadruples (cf. [Va2, 3.2.10]). Let T\u0303 be a\nmaximal Q\u2013torus of G such that:\ni) the Zariski closure of T\u0303Qp in GZp is a maximal torus of GZp with the property that,\n\u2200i \u2208 H, its image in Gi , when extended over W (Fpdi ) has a quotient (via an isogeny)\nwhich is a product Ti1 \u00d7 Ti2 , where Ti1 (resp. where Ti2 ) is itself a product of tori which\nare 1 dimensional and non-split (resp. which are such that their extensions to W (Fp2di )\nhave 0 W (Fp2di )-ranks);\nii) over R it is the extension of a compact torus by a 1 dimensional split torus.\nThe existence of such a torus is obtained by applying [Har, 5.5.3] to G: we just\nneed to show the existence of a maximal torus of Gi (of 4.3.1.1) whose Weil restriction\nfrom W (Fpdi ) to Zp is a torus of Gi to each i) applies. But this is a consequence of the\nfollowing two simple Facts:\nFact 1. \u2200i \u2208 H, Gi is either split or splits over W (Fp2di ).\nFact 2. We consider an absolutely simple, adjoint group S\u0303 of classical Lie type over\na finite field k\u0303 of odd characteristic which splits over the quadratic extension k\u03032 of k\u0303.\nThen, if it is not a split group of An or D2n+1 Lie type or a non-split group of D2n Lie\ntype, with n \u2265 2 (resp. if it so), S\u0303 has a maximal torus T\u0303 which is isogeneous to a direct\nproduct of 1 dimensional non-split tori (resp. to a product of 1 dimensional non-split tori\nand of tori whose ranks over k\u03032 are 0).\n431\n\n\fProofs: Fact 1 is trivial if Gi is not of D4 Lie type; but this special case is a\nconsequence of the fact that no Shimura variety of D4mixed type is of Hodge type (see\n[De2]; see also [Se2, cor. 2 of p. 182]).\nFact 2 can be proved easily, case by case. If S\u0303 is of Cn Lie type, then it is split. So\nto check the existence of T\u0303 , we can assume n = 1; but this case is trivial. If S\u0303 is of Bn\nLie type, then it is split, and again we can assume n = 1, which is already covered by\nthe C1 Lie type case. If S\u0303 is of Dn Lie type, with n \u2265 4, then S\u0303 is the adjoint group of\na special orthogonal group SO of a non-degenerate quadratic form on a 2n dimensional\nk\u0303-vector space. If S\u0303 is split and n is even or if S\u0303 is non-split and n is odd we can take\nas T\u0303 the image in S\u0303 of a product of tori of SO, each one of them leaving invariant a\nquadratic form in two variables x1 and x2 which is of the form x21 \u2212 a22 x22 , with a22 \u2208 k\u0303\nnot a square (argument: the quadratic form y1 y2 + y3 y4 is equivalent to the quadratic\nform x21 \u2212 a22 x22 \u2212 x23 + a22 x24 ). If S\u0303 is split and n is odd or if S\u0303 is non-split and n is even,\nthen using a product of n \u2212 3 tori of SO of the same type and considering the image in\nS\u0303 of its centralizer in SO, the situation gets reduces to the split D3 Lie type case, i.e. to\nthe split A3 Lie type case.\nIf S\u0303 is split of An Lie type, n \u2265 2, then we can argue at the level of representations:\nTn := Resk\u0303n+1 /k\u0303 Gm /Gm , with k\u0303n+1 the finite field extension of k\u0303 such that [k\u0303n+1 : k\u0303] =\nn + 1, is (isomorphic to) a maximal torus of S\u0303; if n is even then Tn has rank 0 over k\u03032 and\nif n is odd then Tn is isogeneous to a product of a 1 dimensional, non-split torus with a\ntorus whose rank over k\u03032 is 0. If S\u0303 is non-split of An Lie type, n \u2265 2, then we can argue\nat the level of non-degenerate hermitian forms in a way similar to the Cn Lie type case;\nsee [Ro, th. of p. 243]. This proves the two Facts.\nAs in [Va2, 3.2.11], we deduce the existence of a special quadruple (T\u0303 , {h\u0303}, H\u0303T\u0303 , \u1e7d) \u0592\u2192\n1\n2\n(G, X, H, v). We fix some i \u2208 Hnc . We consider the cocharacter \u03bci of TiW\n(F) \u00d7 TiW (F)\ndefined naturally by h\u0303 via extensions\nand logical composites. The A-degree of definition\n\u0001\ndA (i) of Lie(Gi W (k) ), \u03c6 \u2297 1 is smaller or equal to the A-degree of definition dz\u0303 (i) of\nthe i-th cyclic adjoint factor Ci (z\u0303) attached to an W (F)-valued point z\u0303 of N factoring\nthrough the integral canonical model of (T\u0303 , {h\u0303}, H\u0303T\u0303 , \u1e7d) (this is the same as 3.11.3.1).\nFrom the proof of 2.2.18 we get that the Shimura filtered \u03c3\u0304-crystal (M\u0303 , F 1 (M\u0303 ), \u03c6\u0303, GW (F) )\nattached to z\u0303 is cyclic diagonalizable. We first assume that the mentioned two A-degrees\nof definition are not equal. So, if the special fibre of z\u0303 factors through U, (M\u0303 , \u03c6\u0303, GW (F) )\nhas two distinct lifts which are cyclic diagonalizable (cf. 2.3.17 and 3.11.1 a) for the second\none). But it is an easy exercise to see that this is not possible (it is solved independently\nin 4.4.13.2-3 below). Contradiction.\n1\nIf \u03bci does not factor through TiW\n(F) , then dz\u0303 (i) > 2di ; on the other hand, Fact 1\nimplies that dA (i) \u2264 2di , and so we get dA (i) 6= dz\u0303 (i). So from now on we assume \u03bci\n1\nfactors through TiW\n(F) . This implies (cf. ii); we need to use a formula similar to the one\nof \u03c6j in 4.1.2): Ci (z\u0303) has all slopes equal to 0. So (cf. formulas of 3.10.6 and 4.2.1 a))\nthe special fibre of z\u0303 does not factor through U. So Nk(v) \\ U is non-empty. This ends\nthe proof of the Corollary.\n\n432\n\n\f4.3.7. Examples. We concentrate just on one Zp -simple factor Gi of Gad\nZp . We can\nassume Hi = S(1, di ). Let z : Spec(W (k)) \u2192 N be a lift of y and let\n\u0010\n\u0001\n\u0001 1\n\u0001\u0011\n0\nC\n:=\nLie\nG\n,\n\u03c6\n,\nF\nLie(G\n)\n,\nF\nLie(G\n)\ni z\ni W (k)\ny\ni W (k)\ni W (k)\n\n\u0001\nbe the i-th cyclic adjoint factor attached to z. If F 1 Lie(Gi W (k) = {0} \u2013i.e. if i \u2208 Hc \u2013\n\u0001\nthere is nothing to be done. From now on we assume i \u2208 Hnc and that F 1 Lie(G1 ) 6= 0.\nLet\n\u03c8\u0304i : Lie(Gi k ) \u2192 Lie(Gi k )\nbe the i-th Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Hasse\u2013Witt adjoint map attached to y (so \u03c8\u0304i is the Faltings\u2013\nShimura\u2013Hasse\u2013Witt map of (Lie(Gi W (k) ), \u03c6y )).\nCase 1. i Cz is without involution. The \u03c3kdi -linear map\n1 \u03c8i\n\ndi\n\n\u0001\n\u0001\n: Lie(G1 )/F 0 (Lie(G1 )) \u2297W (k) k \u2192 Lie(G1 )/F 0 (Lie(G1 )) \u2297W (k) k\n\nobtained from \u03c8\u0304idi by passage to quotients, still computes (in the sense of 3.5)\nthe Lie stable p-rank of i Cz .\n\n1\ndi\n\ntimes\n\nIf moreover i Cz is of Bl , Cl or DlR type, then this Lie stable p-rank is di times the\ndi\n\nfH (i)-entry of Rr (\u03c4 ) iff the \u03c3kdi -linear map 1 \u03c8i has a non-zero determinant (cf. the\nformulas of 3.10.6 i)). So if all simple factors of (Gad , X ad ) are of Bl , Cl or DlR type,\nthen the fact that for a point y \u2208 Nk(v) (k) we have Ry = R(\u03c4 ), can be expressed in terms\nof some determinants being non-zero. This is very close to the intuition provided by the\n(usual) Hasse\u2013Witt matrices.\nmap\n\nCase 2. i Cz is with involution. So i Cz is of Al or of DlH type. The \u03c3k2di -linear\n\n1 \u03c8i\n\n2di\n\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n: Lie(G1 ) /F 0 Lie(G1 ) \u2297W (k) k \u2192 Lie(G1 ) /F 0 Lie(G1 ) \u2297W (k) k\n\nobtained from \u03c8\u0304i2di by passage to quotients, still computes (in the sense of 3.5)\nthe Lie stable p-rank of i Cz .\n\n1\ndi\n\ntimes\n\nSo in the cases when i Cz is of Al or of DlH type, with or without involution, the fact\nmi\nthat the Lie stable p-rank of this \u03c3kmi -linear map 1 \u03c8i , with mi \u2208 {di , 2di }, is (resp. is\nnot) di times the fH (i)-entry ni of Rr (\u03c4 ), can be expressed (cf. 4.3.5) in terms of some\nmatrices of rank at most 1 being non-zero (resp. being zero); such matrices (with entries\nmi\nin k) are obtained by taking the ni -th exterior power of (cf. 3.9.1.0) (1 \u03c8i )dimQ (G) . As\na conclusion:\nProperty. We can always express the fact that for a point y \u2208 Nk(v) (k) we have\nRyr = Rr (\u03c4 ), in terms of some matrices (indexed by i \u2208 Hnc ) of rank at most 1 being\nnon-zero.\n433\n\n\f4.3.8. Remarks. 1) We denote by p \u2212 LieG (y) or by r y the Lie p-rank of y, defined\nas the multiplicity of the slope \u22121 of (Lie(Gad\nW (k) ), \u03c6y ). If p \u2212 LieG (y) 6= 0, then the Lie\nstable p-rank of y is different from 0 and the p-rank of Ay := y \u2217 (A) is different from\n0. But the converses of these two implications are not true, i.e. there are examples (in\nthe case of the first implication, if y is a Shimura-ordinary point, then Gad\nR must have\ncompact factors, cf. the formulas of 3.10.6) when the Lie stable p-rank of y or the p-rank\nof Ay is different from 0 but the Lie p-rank of y is 0.\n2) If f is an isomorphism, i.e. if N = M, to know r y is equivalent to know the\np-rank ry of Ay : we have\nry (ry+1 )\nry =\n.\n2\nBut this is not true in the general context of Shimura varieties of Hodge type.\n3) In the computations of 4.3.7 involving ranks and determinants it is irrelevant\nwhich factor G1 of GiW (k) we choose, subject to F 1 (Lie(G1 )) 6= 0.\nmi\n\n4.3.9. Definitions. The \u03c3kmi -linear map 1 \u03c8i , mi \u2208 {di , 2di }, defined in 4.3.7, is\ncalled the i-th Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Hasse\u2013Witt reduced map attached to y, and the matrix\ndefined by it (via the choice of some k-basis) is referred as the i-th Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013\nHasse\u2013Witt reduced matrix attached to y and to 1 \u2208 Hi . Exterior powers of such maps\nand matrices are called modified i-th Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Hasse\u2013Witt reduced maps or\nmatrices attached to y.\nSimilarly, for any cyclic Shimura Lie F -crystal we define (cf. 3.9.1.1) such maps and\nmatrices. The only difference: mi can be also 3di (cf. 3.10.0). It is 3.9.6 which points out\nthat these Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Hasse\u2013Witt reduced maps are the same as the ones defined\nin a semisimple (not necessarily adjoint) context.\n4.4. G-canonical lifts.\n4.4.0. Definition. A point y : Spec(k) \u2192 Nk(v) is called a parabolic (resp. a Borel\nor reductive) point, if there is a lift z : Spec(W (k)) \u2192 N of it such that the Shimura\nfiltered Lie \u03c3k -crystal attached to z is of parabolic (resp. of Borel or reductive) type.\n4.4.1. Theorem. 1) A point y : Spec(k) \u2192 Nk(v) factors through U iff y is a\nparabolic point.\n2) We assume now that y factors through U. We have:\na) There is a unique lift z : Spec(W (k)) \u2192 N of y with the property that the Shimura\nfiltered Lie \u03c3k -crystal attached to z is of parabolic type;\nb) If k = k\u0304, then the Shimura adjoint filtered Lie \u03c3k -crystal attached to this unique\nlift z is isomorphic to\n\u0010\n\u0001 1\n\u0001\u0011\n1\nad\n0\nad\nad\nLie(GZp ) \u2297Zp W (k), \u03c3\u03bc( ) \u2297 1, F Lie(GZp ) \u2297Zp W (k) , F Lie(GZp ) \u2297Zp W (k) ,\np\nand so it is cyclic diagonalizable and of Borel type (\u03bc being as in 4.1);\n434\n\n\fc) If k = k\u0304 then the Shimura filtered Lie \u03c3k -crystal attached to z is isomorphic to\n\u0010\n\n\u0001\n\u0001\u0011\n1\nLie(GZp ) \u2297Zp W (k), \u03c3\u03bc( ) \u2297 1, F 0 Lie(GZp ) \u2297Zp W (k) , F 1 Lie(GZp ) \u2297Zp W (k) ,\np\n\nand so it is cyclic diagonalizable and of Borel type.\n\u0001\n3) Let My , Fz1 , \u03c6y , GW (k) , (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J \u2032 , \u03c8y be the principally quasi-polarized Shimura\nfiltered \u03c3k -crystal attached to z above. We have:\na) There is a unique cocharacter \u03bcy : Gm \u0592\u2192 GW (k) which produces a direct\nsum decomposition My = Fz1 \u2295 Fz0 such that the elements of the parabolic Lie subalgebra of Lie(GW (k) ) corresponding to non-negative (resp. to non-positive) slopes of\n\u0001\nLie(GW (k) ), \u03c6y take Fz1 (resp. Fz0 ) into itself. We have [\u03bcy ] = [\u03bcW (k) ];\nb) If k = k\u0304, then the filtered \u03c3k -crystal (My , Fz1 , \u03c6y ) is cyclic diagonalizable and its\nisomorphism class does not depend on the choice of y. Moreover, the\u0001 principally quasipolarized Shimura filtered \u03c3k -crystal My , Fz1 , \u03c6y , GW (k) , (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J \u2032 , \u03c8y is isomorphic to\n\u0001\nany sextuple My1 , Fz11 , \u03c6y1 , GW (k) , (t1\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J \u2032 , \u03c8y1 defined similarly but starting from another G-ordinary point y1 : Spec(k) \u2192 U factoring through the same connected component\nof Uk through which y factors;\nc) If k = k\u0304, then there is n \u2208 N such that the principally\nquasi-polarized Shimura fil\u0001\n1\n1 1\nn\nn\n\u2032\ntered \u03c3k -isocrystal My [ p ], Fz [ p ], \u03c6y , GB(k) , (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J , \u03c8y is 1J \u2032 -isomorphic to the principally quasi-polarized Shimura filtered \u03c3kn -isocrystal M \u2297W (k(v)) B(k), F 1 \u2297W (k(v)) B(k),\n\u0001\n(\u03c6 \u2297 1)n , GB(k) , (v\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J \u2032 , \u03c8\u0303 ;\n\u0001\nd)* My , Fz1 , \u03c6y , GW (k) , (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J \u2032 , \u03c8y is 1J \u2032 -isomorphic (in the sense of 2.2.9 6)) to\n\u0001\nM \u2297W (k(v)) W (k), F 1 \u2297W (k(v)) W (k), \u03c6 \u2297 1, GW (k) , (v\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J \u2032 , \u03c8\u0303 .\n\nSo in c) we can take n = 1.\n\nProofs: 1) is a direct consequence of 3.1.0 b) and 2.3.17, cf. 4.2.1 c).\n4.2.3-4 were stated for F. As these results remain obviously true by working with an\nalgebraically closed field containing F, in what follows we refer to them (with no extra\ncomment) in such an extended context.\na) (resp. b)) of 2) follows from 3.2.8 and 2.3.17 (resp. from 3.11.6 A) and 4.2.5-6).\nWe include here a second approach to b) of 2).

The quadruples\n\n435\n\n\f\u0001\n(n0 , F 1 (n0 ), \u03c6y ) and n0 , F 1 (n0 ), \u03c3\u03bc( p1 ) \u2297 1 are filtered Lie \u03c3k -crystals as well as pdivisible objects of MF[0,1] (W (k)). We have F 1 (n0 ) = F 1 (Lie(Gad\nW (k) )), cf. 2.2.12.1\n1).\nLet p00 := W (0)(p\u03030 , \u03c3\u03bc( p1 ) \u2297 1) (resp. p10 := W (0)(p\u03030 , \u03c6y )). As p10 \u2282 F 0 (g), we have\n\u03c6y (p10 ) \u2282 p10 and so\n\u2229n\u2208N \u03c6ny (p\u03030 ) \u2282 p10 .\n\n(1)\nWe have:\n\nFact. p00 and p10 are both Lie algebras of two Levi subgroups P\u030300 and respectively P\u030301\nof P\u03030 (so p10 , as a W (k)-module, is a direct summand of p\u03030 ). Moreover, in (1) we have\nequality.\nProof: The second part of the Fact is a consequence of the fact that (p10 , \u03c6y ) is a\n\u03c3k -crystal having only slopes 0. We now consider the Zariski closure P\u030301 in P\u03030 of the Levi\nsubgroup of P\u03030B(k) having p10 [ p1 ] as its Lie algebra; it is a group scheme over W (k). Let\n\u00d10 be the unipotent radical of P\u03030 .\nFor (p\u03030 , \u03c3\u03bc( p1 ) \u2297 1) the first part of the Fact is obvious, cf. its definition (cf. also\n3.11.2 C and 4.1.6). For (p\u03030 , \u03c6y ) this first part follows from the fact that for any n \u2208 N,\nwe have \u03c6ny = an \u03c6n , with an \u2208 P\u03030 (W (k)). In other words, for any m \u2208 N, taking n big\nenough, \u03c6ny (p\u03030 ) mod pm is on one side included in p10 mod pm (cf. (1)) and on the other\nhand it is the inner conjugate of p00 mod pm by an mod pm . So p10 mod pm is the Lie\nalgebra of a Levi subgroup of P\u03030Wm (k) and so is the Lie algebra of a uniquely determined\nreductive subgroup Rm of P\u03030Wm (k) . The uniqueness of Rm can be proved in many ways.\nFor instance, we have:\nSubfact. Rm is the subgroup Nm of P\u03030Wm (k) normalizing p10 mod pm .\nThe argument for this Subfact goes as follows. As we are in an adjoint context, the\narguments of the proof of the Claim of 3.6.18.7.3 referring to F \u22121 and to TW (k) gives us\nthat Lie(Nm ) is p10 mod pm . So, as Nm contains Rm , we get that Nm is smooth, having\nRm as its connected component of the origin. So to check that Nm = Rm , we just need\nto show that Nm is connected. We can assume m = 1. But N1 is normalized by any\nmaximal torus of R1 and so, as \u00d10k can be identified with the Lie algebra of n0 /pn0\nand as the group of connected components of N1 can be identified with a finite, \u00e9tale\nsubgroup of \u00d10k , we get N1 = R1 .\nThe Subfact implies Rm = Rm+1 Wm (k) . So as Rm contains a maximal torus of\nad\nGWm (k) and as m \u2208 N is arbitrary, the Subfact of 2.2.9 3) can be entirely adapted to\nthe sequence (Rm )m\u2208N . We get the existence of a Levi subgroup R0 of Gad\nW (k) whose\nreduction mod pm is Rm , \u2200m \u2208 N. As Lie(R0 ) = p10 , the generic fibres of R0 and P\u030301 are\nthe same. So R0 = P\u030301 . This proves the Fact.\nAny two Levi subgroups of P\u03030 are conjugate by an element g0 \u2208 P\u03030 (W (k)): this\ncan be proved in the same manner as the Fact 1 of 2.2.9 3), starting from [Bo2, 14.19]\n436\n\n\fapplied over k. Changing \u03c6y (viewed as a \u03c3k -linear automorphism of Lie(Gad\nW (k) )) with\n\u22121\ng0 \u03c6y g0 (i.e. \u2013as p\u03030 \u2282 F 0 (Lie(Gad\nW (k) ))\u2013 changing it by one which is inner isomorphic to\nit), we can assume p00 = p10 . But this implies g \u2208 P\u030300 (W (k)) (cf. the uniqueness part of\nloc. cit. applied\u0001 over B(k)). This means that g fixes (under conjugation) the image of\nh\u0304s in Lie Gad\nW (k) , \u2200s \u2208 S(1, d). We consider the \u03c3k -linear automorphism \u03c31 := g(\u03c3 \u2297 1)\n\nad\nof Lie(Gad\nW (k) ). Let G\u0303Zp be the adjoint group over Zp having\n\n\b\n\u03c31\nLie(Gad\n)\n:=\nx \u2208 Lie(Gad\nW (k)\nW (k) )|\u03c31 (x) = x\n\u03c31\nas its Lie algebra (as k = k\u0304, a Zp -basis of Lie(Gad\nis a W (k)-basis of Lie(Gad\nW (k) )\nW (k) )).\nad\nClaim. G\u0303ad\nZp is naturally isomorphic to GZp .\n\nProof: Let \u03bc\u0303 be the composite of \u03bc with the epimorphism GW (k(v)) \u0589 Gad\nW (k(v)) .\nover Zp (for instance, cf. Fact 2 of 4.1.1.1). As\nWe recall that V0 = W (F). P\u030300 is defined\n\u0001\n0\ng \u2208 P\u03030 (W (k)), we have d\u03bc\u0303 Lie(Gm ) \u2282 Lie(G\u0303ad\nV0 ); so we can assume k = F. As the map\n0\n0\n\u22121\nP\u03030 (F) \u2192 P\u03030 (F) defined by g\u0303 \u2192 g\u0303\u03c3\u0304(g\u0303) is surjective (cf. [Bo2, 16.4]), we can assume\nthat g mod p is the identity element of P\u030300 (F). Argument: as P\u030300 commutes with the\nimage of \u03bc\u0303W (F) , when we replace g(\u03c3 \u03bc\u0303( p1 ) \u2297 1) with g1 g(\u03c3 \u03bc\u0303( p1 ) \u2297 1)g1\u22121 , with g1 \u2208 P\u030300 (V0 ),\nwe get g1 g\u03c3\u0304(g1 )\u22121 (\u03c3 \u03bc\u0303( p1 ) \u2297 1).\nad\ng \u2261 1 mod p implies G\u0303ad\nFp = GFp . But two adjoint semisimple groups over Zp having\nisomorphic special fibres, are isomorphic. Argument: as the root datum of an adjoint\ngroup over W (F) can be read out from its special fibre, from [SGA3, Vol. III, 5.3 of p.\n314] we get that they are isomorphic over W (F); and so we can apply the fact that a\ntorsor of a smooth group scheme over Zp having an Fp -valued point is trivial.\nad\nad\nad\nSo G\u0303ad\nZp is isomorphic to GZp , under an isomorphism lifting the identity G\u0303Fp = GFp\nand taking the image ad T\u03bc of T\u03bc (of 4.1) in Gad\nZp into the similarly defined (via \u03bc\u0303) torus\nad\nT\u0303\u03bc\u0303 of G\u0303ad\nZp ; cf. [SGA3, Vol. II, 3.6 of p. 48] for the last part. This proves the Claim.\n\u0001\n1\nad\nBut now Lie(Gad\nV0 ), \u03c31 \u03bc\u0303( p )\u0001\u2297 1 w.r.t. the new Zp -structure defined by Lie(G\u0303Zp ),\n1\nad\nis exactly Lie(Gad\nV0 ), \u03c3 \u03bc\u0303( p ) \u2297 1 with the old Zp -structure defined by Lie(GZp ). This\n1\n0\nad\nends the second proof of b) of 2), as Lie(Gad\nZp ) \u2297Zp V0 , \u03c3 \u03bc\u0303( p ) \u2297 1, F (Lie(GZp ) \u2297Zp\n\u0001\nV0 ), F 1 (Lie(Gad\nZp ) \u2297Zp V0 ) is of Borel type and cyclic diagonalizable (cf. 4.1.4).\n\nc) of 2) can be obtained entirely as b) of 2): we just have to replace everywhere\nLie(Gad\nZp ) by Lie(GZp ) and to consider parabolic and Levi subgroups of GW (k) instead of\nad\nGW (k) (Levi subgroups of GW (k) are in one-to-one correspondence to the Levi subgroups\nof Gad\nW (k) and so the part of the proof of the above Fact referring to the adjoint context\nof 3.6.18.7.3 still applies).\nFor the proof of a) of 3) we first remark that \u03bcy , if exists, is unique (Fz0 is uniquely\ndetermined, cf. the argument of 3.2.8 for the uniqueness of Fz1 ) and so, due to the\n437\n\n\funiqueness assertion, we can assume k = k\u0304. From Fact 2 of 2.2.9 3) we get: if \u03bcy\nexists then [\u03bcy ] = [\u03bcW (k) ]. So the existence of \u03bcy results directly from b) of 2) (i.e.\na cocharacter \u03bcy of GW (k) , subject to [\u03bcy ] = [\u03bcW (k) ], is uniquely determined by the\ncocharacter \u03bc\u0303y : Gm \u2192 Gad\nW (k) obtained by composing it with \u2013see 4.2.7\u2013 qqu W (k) , cf.\n(DER) of 2.2.6 1)).\nUsing 3.4.11 and 2.3.13.1, for the part of b) of 3) not involving cyclic diagonalizability,\nwe just have to show that for any g \u2208 P00 (W (k)), there is h \u2208 G0W (k) (W (k)) normalizing\nF 1 /pF 1 and such that g\u03c6y = h\u03c6y h\u22121 ; here P00 is the parabolic subgroup of G0W (k) whose\nimage in Gad\nW (k) is P\u03030 . But the existence of h can be obtained following entirely the proof\nof b) of 2) (i.e. following the above Fact and Claim). In other words, the same arguments\nas above involving Levi subgroups allow us to assume that the image of g in Gad\nW (k) (W (k))\nbelongs to P\u030300 (W (k)). Using this, we define G\u0303Zp in the same way we defined G\u0303ad\nZp above;\nas a reductive group over Zp is uniquely determined by its special fibre and as a torsor\nof a reductive group over Zp which is trivial over Fp , is trivial, the proof of the Claim\napplies entirely in the context of the reductive group G\u0303Zp . So a natural variant of the\nfirst paragraph after the proof of the Claim, applies.\nIt is an easy exercise to see that the Shimura filtered \u03c3k -crystal (My , Fz1 , \u03c6y , GW (k) )\nis cyclic diagonalizable. Hint: \u03bcy : Gm \u2192 GW (k) defines an element h\u0304z1 \u2208 End(My ) by\nh\u0304z1 (x) = x if x \u2208 Fz1 and h\u0304z1 (x) = 0 if x \u2208 Fz0 ; denoting h\u0304zs := \u03c6s\u22121\n(h\u0304z1 ), s \u2208 N, we\ny\nagain get that h\u0304zd+1 = h\u0304z1 , i.e. \u03c6dy (h\u0304z1 ) = h\u0304z1 , and the whole argument of the proof of 4.1.2\ncan be repeated. b) of 2) implies that the Shimura filtered Lie \u03c3k -crystal attached to\n(My , Fz1 , \u03c6y , GW (k) ) is of parabolic type and so this exercise is (via 3.1.0 b)) as well a\nparticular case of 3.11.1 a).\nTo see c) of 3) we write \u03c6y = ay \u03bcy ( p1 ), with ay as a \u03c3k -linear automorphism of My .\nMy and GW (k) get a natural Zp -structure My (Zp ) and respectively G\u0303Zp , by considering\nelements fixed by ay (see 2.2.9 8)). The degree of definition of (My , Fz1 , \u03c6y ) is d (cf. end\nof 3.11.2 D and the Fact of 4.3.1.1); so \u03bcy can be viewed as a cocharacter of G\u0303W (k(v))\nand so we can view h\u0304zs 's as belonging to Lie(G\u0303W (k(v)) ). Moreover, t\u03b1 \u2208 T (My (Zp )[ p1 ]),\n\u2200\u03b1 \u2208 J \u2032 . G\u0303Qp is (see 4.2.3) an inner form of GQp , defined by a class\n\u03b3 \u2208 H 1 (Gal(Qp ), GQp (Qp )).\nUsing standard arguments (to be compared with [Va2, 5.2.17.2] and the proof of 2.3.13),\nwe get that the image of \u03b3 in H 1 (Gal(Qun\np ), GQp (Qp )) is 0 (i.e. is the trivial class), where\nQun\nis\nthe\nmaximal\nunramified\nalgebraic\nextension of Qp . From the proof of b) of 2) we\np\nget that the image \u03b3 ad of \u03b3 in H 1 (Gal(Qp ), Gad\nQp (Qp )) is 0; this implies: G\u0303Qp is naturally\nisomorphic to GQp (so GZp is isomorphic to G\u0303Zp , cf. [Ti2]).\nWe now check the following statement: there is n \u2208 N a multiple of d such that\nthe extension to W (Fpn )[ p1 ] of the representation of GQp on L\u2217p becomes isomorphic to\nthe extension to W (Fpn )[ p1 ] of the representation of G\u0303Qp on My (Zp )[ p1 ] and, under such\n438\n\n\fan isomorphism \u03c1(y, n), v\u03b1 goes into t\u03b1 , \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 J \u2032 , \u03c8\u0303 goes into \u03c8y , and h\u0304s goes into h\u0304zs ,\n\u2200s \u2208 S(1, d).\nFirst we need (this takes care of the part of the statement not mentioning h\u0304s 's):\n\u2013 n to be a multiple of d such that the image of \u03b3 in H 1 (Gal(W (Fpn )[ p1 ]), GQp (Qp ))\nis 0 and GB(Fpn ) is split.\nIt is the proof of b) of 2), which takes care of the part involving h\u0304s 's and h\u0304zs 's; the\ntwo obstacles of getting this, i.e. the fact that the map G(B(Fpn )) \u2192 Gad (B(Fpn )) is not\nnecessarily surjective and the fact that we do not want to use the fact \u2013it is argued in\n3.11.2 C\u2013 that the centralizer in GB(k(v)) of all h\u0304i 's is connected, are overcome by the fact\nthat the centralizer C of h\u0304i 's in the parabolic subgroup of GB(k(v)) whose Lie algebra is\nW0 (Lie(GB(k(v)) ), \u03c6) is reductive (cf. the above part pertaining to Levi subgroups) and\nsplits (as GQp does) over B(Fpn ). So the above considerations pertaining to \u03b3 (and its\nimages) apply to a similarly defined class \u03b3c \u2208 H 1 (Gal(B(k(v))), C(Qp )). So second we\nneed:\n\u2013 \u03b3c has 0 image in H 1 (Gal(B(Fpn )), C(Qp )).\nThe fact that the extension of \u03c1(y, n) to B(k) takes (\u03c6 \u2297 1)n into \u03c6ny is obvious, as\n\u03c6n and \u03c6ny are expressible in terms of h\u0304i 's and respectively of h\u0304zi 's. This proves c) of 3).\nFrom 4.1.2 we get that the isomorphism class of the extension of (M, F 1 , \u03c6) to k\nis determined by the elements h\u0304i 's and can be computed working just with rational\ncoefficients (like over B(k(v))). Using this and the above proof of c) of 3), we get that\nthe isomorphism class of the cyclic diagonalizable filtered \u03c3k -crystal (My , Fz1 , \u03c6y ) is the\nsame as of the extension of (M, F 1 , \u03c6) to k and so it is independent of y. This ends the\nproof of b) of 3).\nThe proof of part d) of 3) will be presented in \u00a75 as it is related to Milne's conjecture\nmentioned in 1.15. Here we just remark that we do not need to assume k = k\u0304 (cf. 2.3.9.2).\n4.4.2. Definition. The unique lift z : Spec(W (k)) \u2192 N (resp. z : Spec(W (k)) \u2192\nN /H0 ) of a G-ordinary point y : Spec(k) \u2192 N (resp. of a G-ordinary point y : Spec(k) \u2192\nN /H0 ) with the property that its attached Shimura filtered Lie \u03c3k -crystal is of parabolic\ntype is called the G-canonical or the Shimura-canonical lift of y.\n4.4.2.1. Remark. The right translation by an element of G(Apf ) of a G-canonical\nlift, is again a G-canonical lift (cf. a) of 4.4.1 2) and Fact 6 of 2.3.11). This allows us to\nreplace H0 in the above definition by any compact subgroup H\u03030 of G(Apf ).\n4.4.3. Definition. Let y : Spec(k) \u2192 Nk(v) /H0 (resp. z : Spec(W (k)) \u2192 N /H0 )\nbe an arbitrary k-valued (resp. W (k)-valued) point. Let Ay := y \u2217 (AH0 ) (resp. Az :=\nz \u2217 (AH0 )). An endomorphism fy (resp. fz ) of Ay (resp.\n\u0001 of Az ) is said to be a G1\nendomorphism if, as an element of End Hcrys (Ay /W (k)) , is an endomorphism of the\nquasi Shimura \u03c3k -crystal (My , \u03c6y , G\u0303W (k) ) attached to y (see end of 2.2.9 1') and 2.3.10).\nWe denote the set of G-endomorphisms of Ay (resp. of Az ) by EndG (Ay ) (resp. by\nEndG (Az )). EndG (Ay ) and EndG (Az ) have natural structures of Lie algebras over Z.\n439\n\n\fAn automorphism ay (resp. az ) of Ay (resp. of Az ) is said to be a G-automorphism\n1\nif, as an automorphism of Hcrys\n(Ay /W (k)), is an element of G\u0303W (k) (W (k)). Notation\nAutG (Ay ) (resp. AutG (Az )). AutG (Ay ) and AutG (Az ) have a group structure. Warnings:\n\u2013 in general, AutG (\u2217), as a set, is not a subset of EndG (\u2217); here \u2217 \u2208 {Ay , Az };\n\u2013 EndG (Ay ), EndG (Az ), AutG (Ay ) and AutG (Az ) depend on the choice of AH0 .\nSimilarly we speak about G-RZ \u2013endomorphisms (i.e. about elements of EndG (Ay )\u2297Z\nRZ ), with RZ an arbitrary Z-algebra, or about G-Q\u2013automorphisms.\n4.4.4. Corollary. Let y : Spec(k) \u2192 U/H0 be a G-ordinary point and let z :\nSpec(W (k)) \u2192 N /H0 be its G-canonical lift. Then\nEndG (Ay ) = EndG (Az )\nand\nAutG (Ay ) = AutG (Az ).\nIn other words, any G-endomorphism (resp. any G-automorphism) of Ay lifts to an\nendomorphism (resp. to an automorphism) of Az .\nProof: This is a direct consequence of a) of 4.4.1 2). See also 3.1.1.2.\n4.4.5. Corollary. If \u0001(f, L(p) , v, B) is a standard PEL situation, then any Gcanonical lift z : Spec W (F) \u2192 N /H0 of a G-ordinary point y : Spec(F) \u2192 U gives\nbirth to a special point z0 : Spec(B(F)) \u2192 ShH0 \u00d7H (G, X) (i.e. Az has complex multiplication).\nProof: We view End(Ay ) as a Z-subalgebra of End(My ), with My as in 4.4.3. So\nEndG (Ay ) is the intersection of the centralizer of B in End(Ay ) with the normalizer of\nthe B(F)-vector space of the principal polarization pAy of Ay , obtained from PA by pull\nback through y and viewed as a cycle in the crystalline context. So, as any abelian variety\nover a finite field has complex multiplication, the Q\u2013group defined by invertible elements\nof EndG (Ay ) \u2297Z Q contains a maximal torus of rank equal to the rank of G. So, from the\nidentity EndG (Ay ) = EndG (Az ) of 4.4.4, we get that the Mumford\u2013Tate group of (the\ngeneric fibre) of Az is a torus. This proves the Corollary.\n4.4.6. Remark. In \u00a76 and \u00a712 we will see that 4.4.5 remains true without assuming\nthat (f, L(p) , v) comes from a standard PEL situation (f, L(p) , v, B). This will easily imply\nthat U is a locally closed subscheme of Mk(v) (cf. \u00a713).\n4.4.7. Remark. We assume k = k\u0304. With the notations of the proof of c) of 4.4.1 3),\nMy (Zp ) := {x \u2208 My |ay (x) = x} is a Zp -structure on M w.r.t.\u0001 which \u03bcy can be viewed as\nan injective cocharacter \u03bcy : Gm \u0592\u2192\u0001 GL My (Zp )\u2297Zp W (k(v)) ; we have t\u03b1 \u2208 T (My (Zp )),\n\u2200\u03b1 \u2208 J \u2032 .

For all these cf. the proof of c) of 4.4.1 3).\n4.4.8. Exercises. 1) We assume 4.4.6.

Hint: use 3.10.7.\nFor a theory behind (and a complete solution of) 4.4.8 see 4.4.13.2.\n4.4.9. Remark. Coming back to 4.4.4, we would like to mention that not always\nwe have End(Ay ) = End(Az ). This is always the case when k(v) = Fp , cf. properties\nP 1 and 4.6 P2 below. But when k(v) 6= Fp , we can have End(Ay ) \u2283 End(Az ) for some\n6=\n\nG-ordinary points y. For instance this is so when G is a torus and the Shimura-ordinary\n\u0001\ntype we get is a supersingular type (concrete example: when Sh GSp(W, \u03c8), S is the\nelliptic modular curve, G is a torus and the prime v is such that the Shimura-ordinary\ntype is (1,1)). There are many examples with G a torus such that End(Ay ) 6= End(Az ),\nand starting from this we can obtain examples with G a reductive group which is not a\ntorus and when not always End(Ay ) is equal to End(Az ).\nHowever, in \u00a714, we will see that\nEnd(Ay ) \u2297Z Q = EndG (Ay ) \u2297Z Q \u2295 End(Ay )\u22a5G \u2297Z Q\nand similarly\nEnd(Az ) \u2297Z Q = EndG (Az ) \u2297Z Q \u2295 End(Az )\u22a5G \u2297Z Q,\nwhere End(Ay )\u22a5G (resp.

Problem. Referring again to 4.4.4, study the structure of the Lie algebras\nEndG (Ay ) \u2297Z Q and EndG (Ay ) for various G-ordinary points y : Spec(k) \u2192 U/H0 . The\nmost interesting case is when k is a subfield of F.\n4.4.11. Remark. Not only d(C) but also the numbers d\u22a5 (C) and gd(C) (defined in 3.13.1), with C the Shimura filtered \u03c3k -crystal attached to a G-canonical lift\nz : Spec(W (k)) \u2192 N , do not depend on the choice of z (cf. c) of 4.4.1 3)).\n4.4.12. Remark. We assume that d) of 4.4.1 3) holds and that k = k\u0304. Let\nV (k) be a complete DVR which is a finite, faithfully flat extension of W (k). Let\nmV (k) : Spec(V (k)) \u2192 N be a morphism. Let (AV (k) , pAV (k) ) := m\u2217V (k) (A, PA ) and let\nV (k)\n\n(t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J \u2032 be the family of Hodge cycles with which AV (k) is naturally endowed. From\n2.3.13.1 and the density part of 4.2.1, we deduce the existence of a V (k)-isomorphism\n1\nL\u2217p \u2297Zp V (k) = M \u2297W (k(v)) V (k)\u2192H\n \u0303 dR\n(AV (k) /V (k))\nV (k)\n\ntaking \u03c8\u0303 into pAV (k) and taking v\u03b1 into t\u03b1\n\n, \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 J \u2032 .\n\n4.4.13. The U -ordinariness. 2.2.17.1 raises the question: when a lift of quasi CM\ntype of a Shimura F -crystal over a perfect field is unique? To answer this question we\nstart with some definitions. In what follows k is an arbitrary perfect field.\n4.4.13.1. Definitions. a) A potentially cyclic diagonalizable Shimura \u03c3k -crystal\n(M\u0303 , \u03c6\u0303, G\u0303) over k is called a U -ordinary \u03c3k -crystal, if its extension to k\u0304 has a unique lift\nof quasi CM type.\nb) Due to this uniqueness, this lift of quasi CM type is defined (via natural extension)\nby a direct summand F 1 (M\u0303 ) of M\u0303 . F 1 (M\u0303 ) itself or the Shimura filtered \u03c3k -crystal\n(M\u0303 , F 1 (M\u0303 ), \u03c6\u0303, G\u0303) is called the U -canonical lift of (M\u0303 , \u03c6\u0303, G\u0303).\nc) A U -ordinary Shimura \u03c3k -crystal (M\u0303 , \u03c6\u0303, G\u0303) is called T -ordinary if the Lie algebra\nT := W (0)(Lie(G\u0303), \u03c6\u0303) is abelian (due to the potentially cyclic diagonalizable part implicit\nin the definition of U -ordinariness, this is equivalent \u2013cf. 2.2.19.2\u2013 to: T is the Lie algebra\nof a maximal torus of G\u0303).\nd) In the same way we defined G-ordinary points of Nk(v) , we define U -ordinary and\nT -ordinary points of it, as well as U -canonical lifts of U -ordinary points of Nk(v) (or of\nNk(v) /H\u03030 ) with values in perfect fields.\ne) a) to c) extend naturally to the context of Shimura (filtered) Lie \u03c3k -crystals or\nto the context of generalized Shimura p-divisible objects. In particular we speak about\nU -ordinary Shimura Lie \u03c3k -crystals and about their U -canonical lifts (to be compared\nwith 3.11.6.1).\nWe have the following characterization of U -ordinary \u03c3k -crystals:\n4.4.13.2. Proposition. A Shimura \u03c3k -crystal (M\u0303 , \u03c6\u0303, G\u0303) over k is U -ordinary\niff it can be extended to a Shimura filtered \u03c3k -crystal (M\u0303 , F 1 (M\u0303 ), \u03c6\u0303, G\u0303) whose attached\nShimura filtered Lie \u03c3k -crystal is (see def. 2.2.12 d)) of toric type.\n442\n\n\fProof: We first assume the existence of an F 1 -filtration F 1 (M\u0303 )\u0001 of M\u0303 such that\nthe Shimura filtered Lie \u03c3k -crystal Lie(G\u0303), \u03c6\u0303, F 0 (Lie(G\u0303)), F 1 (Lie(G\u0303)) is of toric type.\nLet Z be the integral, closed subgroup of G\u0303 such that the Lie algebra of its generic fibre\nis W (0)(Lie(G\u0303)[ p1 ], \u03c6\u0303). We can assume k = k\u0304. So, the generic fibre of Z has a natural\nQp -structure ZQp : the Lie algebra of ZQp is formed by elements of Lie(Z)[ p1 ] fixed by \u03c6\u0303.\nZQp is a reductive group having a maximal torus of the same dimension as the rank of\nGC (cf. 2.2.3 3) and the Qp -version of 2.2.9 8)).\nLet \u03bc\u0303 : Gm \u2192 G\u0303 be the canonical split of (M\u0303 , F 1 (M\u0303 ), \u03c6\u0303, G\u0303). As in the proof of 2.2.18\nwe get that F 1 (M\u0303 ) is a lift of quasi CM type and that \u03bc\u0303B(k) factors through the center\nof Z. Let now F11 (M\u0303 ) be another lift of quasi CM type of (M\u0303 , \u03c6\u0303, G\u0303). Let \u03bc\u03031 : Gm \u2192 G\u0303\nbe the canonical split of (M\u0303 , F11 (M\u0303 ), \u03c6\u0303, G\u0303). Its generic fibre factors through a maximal\ntorus of ZB(k) and so it commutes with \u03bc\u0303. This implies \u03bc\u0303 = \u03bc\u03031 (to be compared with\nFact 2 of 2.2.9 3)) and so we have F11 (M\u0303 ) = F 1 (M\u0303 ).\nTo prove the other implication, we can assume k = k\u0304. We just have to show that for\nany cyclic diagonalizable Shimura filtered \u03c3k -crystal (M\u0303 , F 1 (M\u0303 ), \u03c6\u0303, G\u0303) whose Shimura\nfiltered Lie \u03c3k -crystal is not of toric type, there is a lift F11 (M\u0303 ) of quasi CM type of\n(M\u0303 , \u03c6\u0303, G\u0303) which is different from F 1 (M\u0303 ). Let ZQp be as above. It is easy to see (using\njust topological arguments) that there is g \u2208 ZQp (Qp ) which takes M\u0303 onto itself and\nwhich does not normalize F 1 (M\u0303 ); as any such g is fixed by \u03c6, it moreover normalizes\nF 1 (M\u0303 )/pF 1 (M\u0303 ). But now, from the very def. 2.2.17, we get that g(F 1 (M\u0303 )) is another\nlift of quasi CM type of (M\u0303 , \u03c6\u0303, G\u0303). This ends the proof.\n4.4.13.2.1. Corollary. A Shimura \u03c3k -crystal is U -ordinary iff its Shimura adjoint\nfiltered Lie \u03c3-crystal is.\nThis is a consequence of 4.4.13.2 and of the Fact of 2.2.13.3.\n4.4.13.3. Examples. From 4.4.13.2 and 3.1.0 a) we get: any Shimura-ordinary\n\u03c3k -crystal is U -ordinary and any Shimura-canonical lift is a U -canonical lift. This solves\nall 3 exercises of 4.4.8 (for 4.4.8 1) cf. also 2.3.17). But there are plenty of U -ordinary\n\u03c3k -crystals which are not Shimura-ordinary; below we present the simplest type of such\nexamples, directly in the adjoint context.\n4.4.13.3.1. New examples. Let G\u03030 be a split, simple, adjoint group over Zp of\nsome Cn , Bn , E7 or (with n \u2265 4) Dn Lie type. Let G\u0303 := ResW (Fp3 )/Zp G\u03030W (Fp3 ) ; so G\u03030\nis naturally a subgroup of G\u0303. G\u0303W (Fp3 ) is a product of three copies G\u03031 , G\u03032 and G\u03033 of\nG\u03030W (Fp3 ) . Let \u03bc\u0303 : Gm \u0592\u2192 G\u0303 be an injective cocharacter factoring through G\u03030 and such\nthat the pair (G\u0303, [\u03bc\u0303]) is a Shimura group pair; if G\u03030 is of Dn Lie type, we assume (G\u0303, [\u03bc\u0303])\nis of DnR type (i.e. the derived subgroup of the centralizer of \u03bc\u0303 in G\u03030 is of Dn\u22121 Lie type).\nWe consider a maximal torus T\u0303 of G\u0303 through which \u03bc\u0303 factors and a Borel subgroup of G\u0303\ncontaining T\u0303 and such that Lie(B\u0303) is included in the F 0 -filtration of Lie(G\u0303) produced as\nusual \u2013see 2.2.8 3)\u2013 by \u03bc\u0303. Let w \u2208 G\u0303(W (Fp3 )) be a Weyl element (w.r.t. T\u0303 ) such that\n443\n\n\fits component in G\u03033 is trivial, while its component in G\u0303i (i \u2208 {1, 2}) takes B\u0303W (Fp3 ) \u2229 G\u0303i\ninto its opposite (w.r.t. the maximal torus T\u0303W (Fp3 ) \u2229 G\u0303i of G\u0303i ).\nAs in 4.1.5 we construct a Shimura adjoint filtered Lie \u03c3Fp3 -crystal\n\u0001\n1\nLie(G\u0303W (Fp3 ) ), w(\u03c3 \u03bc\u0303( ) \u2297 1), F 0 (Lie(G\u0303W (Fp3 ) )), F 1 (Lie(G\u0303W (Fp3 ) ))\np\nwhich is (to be compared with 4.1.5.2) potentially cyclic diagonalizable, is of toric type\nbut, as its Lie stable p-rank is 0, it is not of parabolic type. So any generalized Shimura\nfiltered \u03c3Fp3 -crystal C having it as its attached adjoint is a U -canonical lift, without\nbeing a Shimura-canonical lift; if G\u0303 is of A1 Lie type, then the U -ordinary \u03c3Fp3 -crystal\nunderlying C is in fact a T -ordinary \u03c3Fp3 -crystal.\nSimilar examples can be constructed modeled on some An , DnH , E6 or Dnmixed type.\nThere are plenty of examples involving as well adjoint factors which are included in the\ncorresponding F 0 -filtration, as well as examples which involve other Weyl elements. See\n[Va8] for a minute analysis and classification of such examples.\n4.4.13.4. Remarks. 1) 4.4.13.2 implies that U -ordinary points which are not\nShimura-ordinary do not show up in the classical setting of Siegel modular varieties. But\nthey do show up in the context of some of the classical standard PEL situations of [Ko2,\nch. 5] (for instance, cf. the Cn Lie type part of 4.4.13.3.1 and 4.12.12.6 below; see also\n4.12.12.6.6 3) below). To our knowledge, not even one example of a U -ordinary point\nwhich is not Shimura-ordinary has been previously identified as such.\n2) 4.4.3-4, 4.4.5-6 and 4.4.9-10 extend to the context of U -ordinary points; in particular, 4.4.5-6 give us completely new ways to construct abelian varieties having complex\nmultiplication (in connection to 4.4.6 and 4.4.9-10 see \u00a76 and respectively \u00a714).\n3) The letter T in 4.4.13.1 stands for toric, while the letter U stands for uniqueness\nas well as for the way (serpent like) the Weyl elements (see 4.4.13.3.1 for a sample) have\nto act on different Lie algebras of (some) adjoint groups in order to produce U -ordinary\n(Lie) \u03c3k -crystals.\n4) We do not know when the U -ordinariness is an isogeny invariant or when 3.11.5\nholds for U -ordinary \u03c3k\u0304 -crystals. Also we do not know when we can recognize a U ordinary (adjoint Lie) \u03c3k -crystal from its Newton polygon. It seems to us, that the\nanswer would be: only when we are in a Shimura-ordinary context.\n5) As in 3.11.3 we define the degree, the T -degree and (when appropriate) the Adegree of definition of a U -ordinary \u03c3k -crystal (M\u0303 , \u03c6\u0303, G\u0303). Following 3.1.5, the canonical\nsplit cocharacter \u03bc\u0303 of its U -canonical lift is also called the canonical split cocharacter of\n(M\u0303 , \u03c6\u0303, G\u0303). It has interpretations similar to the ones of 3.1.4-6:\nINT. \u03bc\u0303 is the unique cocharacter of G\u0303 defining the filtration class of (M\u0303 , \u03c6\u0303, G\u0303) and\nsuch that its image fixes the elements of W (0)(Lie(G\u0303), \u03c6\u0303) (cf. the proof of 4.4.13.2). It\nis fixed by any automorphism of (M\u0303 , \u03c6\u0303, G\u0303). Any endomorphism of (M\u0303 , \u03c6\u0303, G\u0303) is as well\nan endomorphism of its U -canonical lift.\n444\n\n\fSimilarly we define the canonical split cocharacter of any U -ordinary Shimura Lie\n\u03c3k -crystal L. It has an entirely similar interpretation as of INT.\n4.4.13.5. Remark. We have the following variant of the Proposition of AE.4:\nCorollary. Let g \u2208 Aut(G, X, H). If ag fixes an F-valued U -ordinary point of N ,\nthen it fixes its U -canonical lift z : Spec(W (F)) \u2192 N .\nProof: In such a case g0 (defined as in [Va2, p. 495] starting from the non-trivial\npart of the Shimura adjoint filtered Lie \u03c3F -crystal Cad\nz attached to z), is an automorphism\nof Cad\nitself\n(see\n4.4.13.4\n5))\nand\nso\n(cf.\nthe\nuniqueness\npart of 2.3.17) ag fixes z.\nz\n4.5. Different stratifications.\n4.5.1. Definition. The stratification of Nk(v) in G(Apf )-invariant, reduced, locally\nclosed subschemes indexed and defined by Newton polygons of Shimura Lie \u03c3k -crystals\nattached to points Spec(k) \u2192 Nk(v) , is called the canonical Lie stratification.\n4.5.2. Definition. The stratification of Nk(v) in G(Apf )-invariant, reduced, locally\nclosed subschemes, indexed and defined by sequences of length |H| formed by Newton\npolygons of the cyclic factors (their number is |H|) of Shimura adjoint Lie \u03c3k -crystals\nattached to points Spec(k) \u2192 Nk(v) , is called the refined canonical Lie stratification.\n4.5.3. Remarks. 1) U is the open, dense stratum of both stratifications of Nk(v)\ndefined above (cf. 4.2.1 and 4.3.4). In the refined context, in all that follows we can as\nwell replace H by Hnc .\n2) Let i \u2208 H. Let \u03c0i be the projector of End(L\u2217p [ p1 ]) on Lie(Gi ) having as its kernel\nthe elements of End(L\u2217p [ p1 ]) perpendicular on Lie(Gi ) with respect to the trace form on\nEnd(L\u2217p [ p1 ]) (to be compared with [Va2, 4.2] and AE.0). It is fixed by GQp and so it\ncan be viewed (cf. [Va2, 4.1] and the identifications of [Va2, top of p. 473]) as a Qp linear combination of Betti realizations of Hodge cycles of abelian varieties over fields\nof characteristic zero obtained by pulling back AH0 . We can assume as well that \u03c0i is\na Qp -linear combination of v\u03b1 's of 2.3.1. So the G(Apf )-invariant part of 4.5.1-2 follows\nfrom this and the paragraph after Fact 4 of 2.3.11.\n4.5.4. \u03c1 p-divisible objects. We assume k = k\u0304. Any representation\n\u03c1 : GZp \u2192 GL(N ),\nwith N a non-zero, free Zp -module of finite rank, allows us to attach to any point z :\nSpec(W (k)) \u2192 N , a p-divisible object \u03c1 Cz of MF[a\u03c1 ,b\u03c1 ] (W (k)); here a\u03c1 , b\u03c1 \u2208 Z are\ndefined by the fact that\n\u0001\n\u03bc\u03c1 := \u03c1W (k(v)) \u25e6 \u03bc : Gm \u2192 GL N \u2297Zp W (k(v))\nproduces a direct sum decomposition\n\nN \u2297Zp W (k(v)) = \u2295i\u2208I\u03c1 F\u03c1i ,\n445\n\n\fwith all F\u03c1i 6= 0, with a\u03c1 , b\u03c1 \u2208 I\u03c1 such that I\u03c1 \u2282 S(a\u03c1 , b\u03c1 ), and where \u03b2 \u2208 Gm (W (k(v)))\nacts through \u03bc\u03c1 on F\u03c1i as the multiplication with \u03b2 \u2212i . This goes as follows.\nLet y be the special fibre of z. We consider a 1J \u2032 -isomorphism\n(in the sense of\n\u0001\n\u2032\n2.2.9 6)) of the quadruple\nM\n\u2297\nW\n(k),\n\u03bc\n,\n(v\n)\n,\n\u03c8\u0303\nwith\nthe quadruple\n\u03b1 \u03b1\u2208J\nW (k(v))\nW (k)\n\u0001\nMy , \u03bcy , (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J \u2032 , pAy , cf. d) of 4.4.1 3) and 4.4.12. If we do not want to use d) of 4.4.1\n3), then we can use Zp -structures as in 2.2.9 8): at the end we get the same thing.\n\u0001\n1\nHere (Az , pAz ) := z \u2217 (A, PA ), Ay is the special fibre of Az and My := Hcrys\nAy /W (k) ;\n(t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J \u2032 is the family of de Rham (crystalline) components of the family of Hodge cycles\nwith which Az is naturally endowed. \u03bcy : Gm \u2192 GL(My ) is a cocharacter fixing t\u03b1 ,\n\u2200\u03b1 \u2208 J \u2032 ; it produces a direct sum decomposition My = Fz1 \u2295 Fz0 , with Fz1 as the Hodge\nfiltration of My defined by Az and with \u03b2 \u2208 Gm (W (k)) acting through \u03bcy on Fzi as the\nmultiplication with \u03b2 \u2212i .\nWe can write the Frobenius \u03c6y of My , under this isomorphism, as g(\u03c3\u03bc( p1 ) \u2297 1) with\ng \u2208 G0Zp (W (k)) \u2282 GL(M )(W (k)). Now we define\n\u03c1 Cz\n\nwith\n\n\u0001\n:= N \u2297Zp W (k), (F\u03c1i \u2297W (k(v)) W (k))i\u2208I\u03c1 , \u03c6y,\u03c1 ,\n1\n\u03c6y,\u03c1 := \u03c1W (k) (g)(\u03c3\u03bc\u03c1( ) \u2297 1).\np\n\nObviously, \u03c1 Cz is uniquely determined up to inner isomorphism (regardless of all choices).\nIn \u00a75 we will see that there is a p-divisible object\n\u03c1 CN\n\u2207\nof MF[a\n(N ) attached to \u03c1 in such a manner that in z it becomes \u03c1 Cz . \u03c1 Cz is called\n\u03c1 ,b\u03c1 ]\nthe \u03c1 p-divisible object of MF[a\u03c1 ,b\u03c1 ] (W (k)) attached to z.\n\nThe p-divisible object \u03c1 CN defines a Newton polygon stratification of Nk(v) in G(Apf )invariant, reduced, locally closed subschemes (cf. \u00a75). We call it the \u03c1-stratification\nof Nk(v) . As here we do not show the existence of \u03c1 CN , we briefly indicate how we\ncan define the \u03c1-stratification of Nk(v) directly, by just sketching the construction of\n\u03c1 CN . We can work in the \u00e9tale topology of NW (k) , around the point through which\ny factors. In order to apply 2.3.15, we still denote by z the resulting W (k)-morphism\nSpec(W (k)) \u2192 NW (k) /H0 . Let a : Y = Spec(R) \u2192 NW (k) /H0 be as in 2.3.15. We\nassume a factors through an affine subscheme of NW (k) /H0 whose p-adic completion\nhas a Frobenius lift and it is compatible with the two Frobenius lifts. Let (My \u2297W (k)\nR\u2227 , Fz1 \u2297W (k) R\u2227 , gY (\u03c6y \u2297 1), \u2207R\u2227 ) have the analogue meaning of 2.3.15 d). Following\nthe same pattern of the construction of \u03c1 Cz , we consider the following p-divisible object\n\u2207\n\u03c1 CR of MF[a\u03c1 ,b\u03c1 ] (R)\n\u0001\n(N \u2297Zp R\u2227 , (F\u03c1i \u2297W (k(v)) R\u2227 )i\u2208I\u03c1 , \u03c1R (gY )(\u03c6y,\u03c1 \u2297 1), \u2207R\u2227 .\n446\n\n\fHere, as \u2207R\u2227 respects the GR -action, we still denote by \u2207R\u2227 the connection on N \u2297Zp R\nit defines naturally (via the Lie homomorphism Lie(GZp ) \u2192 End(N ) associated to \u03c1).\nUsing Teichm\u00fcller lifts Spec(W (F)) \u2192 Y , we get that the Newton polygon stratification\nof R/pR defined by \u03c1 CR , is the pull back via the special fibre of a of a Newton polygon\nstratification of the image IM of the special fibre of a in Nk /H0 ; it is nothing else but\nthe Newton polygon stratification defined by the Newton polygons of \u03c1 Cz and so it is the\npull back to IM of the \u03c1-stratification of NF /H0 . Standard arguments (based on 4.5.6\n1) below and the part of 2.3.9 A referring to F) show that in the last sentence we can\nreplace NF /H0 by Nk(v) /H0 .\n4.5.5. Definition. The intersection of all \u03c1-stratifications of Nk(v) is called the\nabsolute stratification of Nk(v) .\n4.5.6. Exercises. 0) The \u03c1-stratification of Nk(v) is trivial (i.e. formed just by one\nstratum) iff \u03bc\u03c1 factors through the center of the image of \u03c1W (k(v)) in GL(N \u2297Zp W (k(v))).\nHint: use 3.2.2 and the proof of 4.3.6.\n1) Any \u03c1-stratification is G(Apf )-invariant. Hint: adapt 4.5.3 2).\n2) The canonical Lie stratification is the Ad-stratification, where Ad : GZp \u2192\nGL(Lie(Gad\nZp )) is the adjoint representation.\n3) If Adi : GZp \u2192 GL(Lie(Gi )), i \u2208 H, is the (irreducible) subrepresentation of\nAd induced on the Zp -direct summand Lie(Gi ) of Lie(Gad\nZp ) (see 4.3.1), then the refined\ncanonical Lie stratification is the intersection of all Adi -stratifications, i \u2208 H.\n4) The absolute stratification is well-defined, i.e. its strata are locally closed subschemes and their number is finite. In fact, always there is a \u03c1 such that the absolute\nstratification and the \u03c1-stratification coincide. Hints: for the first part use that the set\nof G(B(F))-conjugacy classes of semisimple elements obtained as in 2.2.24.1 but working\nwith a Cl(M0 , \u03c60 , GW (F) ) as in 4.2.6 is finite; for the second part, starting from a finite\nnumber \u03c11 , \u03c12 ,..., \u03c1m of representations of GZp such that the absolute\nPm stratification is the\nintersection of the \u03c1i 's stratifications, i \u2208 S(1, m), use a sum s=1 \u03c1s (ns ), with all ns 's\nbelonging to N and such that n1 << n2 << ... << nm ; here \u03c1s (ns ) is the tensor product\nrepresentation of \u03c1s with the one dimensional representation achieving the Tate twist by\nZ\n(ns ) (variant, if all images of \u03c1s 's are semisimple, we can equally well work with a sum\nPpm\ns=1 ns \u03c1s ).\n5) If N = M, the usual Newton polygon and absolute stratifications coincide. Hint:\nsee 4.5.6.1 below.\n\n6) If \u03c10 : GZp \u0592\u2192 GL(L\u2217p ) is the faithful representation introduced in 4.1, then the\n\u03c10 -stratification is the stratification of Nk(v) defined by Newton polygons of Shimura\nF -crystals attached to points of Nk(v) with values in perfect fields.\n7) Show by examples that 5) is not true for an arbitrary SHS (f, L(p) , v). Hint: either\nuse products of Shimura varieties of Hodge type or look at the case when |Hnc | \u2265 2.\n8) U is an open subscheme of the open, dense stratum of any \u03c1-stratification and so\nit is the open, dense stratum of the absolute stratification. Hint: use b) of 4.4.1 2).\n447\n\n\f9) Show that the \u03c1-stratification depends only on the restriction of \u03c1 to Gder\nQp . Hint:\nuse the part of 4.2.7 involving abelianizations of groups.\nAll the above Exercises are very easy.\n4.5.6.1. Proposition. We assume Gad has no simple factor of:\n\u2013 An or Dn Lie type, n \u2208 N, n \u2265 2, or of\n\u2013 Bn , n \u2208 N, n \u2265 4, which has a simple factor over Qp corresponding to an i \u2208 Hnc\nsuch that \u03b5ci (v ad ) is not an 1-tuple.\nThen the absolute stratification coincides with the refined Lie canonical stratification.\nProof: Let yl : Spec(k) \u2192 Nk(v) , l = 1, 2, be two points of the same stratum of\nthe refined canonical Lie stratification of Nk(v) . We need to show that they belong to\nthe same stratum of any \u03c1-stratification of Nk(v) . Let (Ml , \u03c6l , GW (k) ) be the Shimura\n\u03c3k -crystal attached to yl . Let m \u2208 N be such that \u03c6m\nl acts diagonally on elements of\n1\na B(k)-basis of Ml [ p ]. We can assume that k = F and so that the Shimura \u03c3k -crystals\ninvolved are defined over finite fields; so we can always choose m so that 2.2.24 applies:\nwe get a semisimple element bl \u2208 G(B(F)), whose eigenvalues, as an endomorphism of Ml\nare p to powers m times the slopes of (M, \u03c6l ), multiplicities corresponding. For future\nreferences, from now on we still use the general notation k instead of F (cf. 2.2.24.1).\nWe choose m to be a multiple of 6 times the product of the lengths of the cyclic\nadjoint factors of the Shimura Lie \u03c3k -crystal attached to y1 (or y2 ; 4.2.10 or 4.4.1 2)\nimplies this product does not depend on y1 ). The key fact is:\nClaim. Replacing m by a suitable multiple of itself, we can assume b1 and b2 are\nG(B(k))-conjugate.\nTo prove this claim, let G\u0303 be the product of the simply connected semisimple group\ncover of Gder and of the connected component of the origin of Z(G). Replacing m by a\nmultiple of itself, bl is replaced by a positive power of itself; so we can assume bl lifts to\nan element b\u0303l \u2208 G\u0303(B(k)). We consider a representation\nG\u0303B(k) \u2192 GL(VB(k) )\nder\nfactoring through G\u0303der\nB(k) and such that when restricted to G\u0303B(k) it is a direct sum, indexed\nby the simple factors of Gad\nB(k) , of the standard embeddings (see [He, \u00a78 of ch. 3]) of the\nclassical groups defined by suitable group covers of these simple factors (these group covers\nder\nare quotients of G\u0303der\nB(k) ). For instance, if we have a factor Sp(\u1e7cB(k) , \u03c8\u0303B(k) ) of G\u0303B(k) , with\n\n(\u1e7cB(k) , \u03c8\u0303B(k) ) a symplectic space over B(k), then we get the natural representation of\nSp(\u1e7cB(k) , \u03c8\u0303B(k) ) on \u1e7cB(k) . Similarly, if we have a simple factor of Gad\nB(k) of Bl Lie type,\nwe get the classical orthogonal faithful representation of dimension 2l + 1 of the split\nSO(2l + 1)-group (over B(k)).\nb\u0303l acts diagonally on VB(k) ; we can choose b\u0303l so that its eigenvalues, as an automorphism of VB(k) , are integral powers of p. b\u0303l also acts diagonally (via inner conjugation)\n448\n\n\fon each simple factor F of the Lie algebra of the image of Lie(G\u0303der\nB(k) ) in End(\u1e7cB(k) ).\nWith its eigenvalues, as an automorphism of F , we construct a Newton polygon N Pl (F ).\n3.4.1 and 3.4.2.2 imply that the images of bl in a set of GL-groups of Lie algebras of simple factors of Gad\nB(k) which are permuted transitively by \u03c6l , up to isomorphism of these\ngroups, are the same. So, the fact that y1 and y2 are points of the same stratum of the\nrefined canonical Lie stratification of Nk(v) , gets restated in: for each such simple factor\nF we have\n(EQ)\n\nN P1 (F ) = N P2 (F ).\n\nFact. Let C be a classical semisimple, split group over B(k) which has a simple\nadjoint and is not of Al Lie type with l \u2265 2 (so C is SO(n) or Sp(n), for some adequate\nn \u2208 N). Let b1 and b2 be semisimple elements of C(B(k)) such that their eigenvalues\n(under the classical representation of C) are integral powers of p. We assume that the\nNewton polygons defined by the eigenvalues of their actions (via inner conjugation) on\nLie(C) are the same. We have:\na) if C is of Cn or B3 Lie type, then b1 and b2 are C(B(k))-conjugate;\nb) if C = SO(2n) (i.e. if C is of Dn Lie type) and if the greatest eigenvalue of b1\nand the greatest eigenvalue of b2 both have multiplicity greater than 1, then b1 and b2 are\nconjugate by a B(k)-valued point of the orthogonal group O(2n);\nc) if C = SO(2n + 1) (i.e. if C is of Bn Lie type) and if the greatest eigenvalue of\nb1 and the greatest eigenvalue of b2 both have multiplicity greater than 1, then b1 and b2\nare C(B(k))-conjugate.\nThe simple proof of this Lemma is left as an exercise.\nLet miso = 2 be the exponent of the kernel of the natural isogeny from G\u0303B(k) into\nder\nthe product of G\u0303ab\nB(k) with the image of G\u0303B(k) in GL(VB(k) ). As in 4.2.7, we can assume\nnc\nthat the images of b\u03031 and b\u03032 in G\u0303ab\nbe such that Gi is of Bn\nB(k) are the same. Let i \u2208 H\nLie type. We take F to be included in Lie(GiB(k) ). If the i-th cyclic adjoint factor of y1\nor of y2 is Shimura-ordinary, then from (EQ) and from 4.4.1 2) and 4.2.1 b) we get that\nwe can assume the images of b\u03031 and b\u03032 in the simple factor of G\u0303ad\nB(k) corresponding to F\nare the same. If the i-th cyclic adjoint factors of y1 and of y2 are not Shimura-ordinary\nand if \u03b5ci (v ad ) is an 1-tuple, then (easy exercise; it is implicitly solved by 4.12.12.6.4.1 a)\nbelow) we are in a situation where c) applies. So, from (EQ) and a) and c) we conclude:\nm2iso\n\nb\u03031\n\nm2\n\nand b\u03032 iso are G\u0303(B(k))-conjugate. This proves the Claim.\nThe Claim implies: y1 and y2 are points of the same stratum of any \u03c1-stratification\nof Nk(v) (cf. the constructions in 4.5.4). This ends the proof of the Proposition.\n4.5.6.2. Examples. A. It seems to us that the restriction on Bn Lie types in 4.5.6.1\nis not needed. If i \u2208 Hnc is such that Gi is of Bn Lie type, then Gi is split and so it is the\nspecial orthogonal group of a perfect, symmetric bilinear form on a free W (Fpdi )-module\nV (i) of rank 2n + 1. So, viewing V (i) as a Zp -module, we consider the representation\n\u03c1\u0303ad\ni : GZp \u2192 GL(V (i))\n449\n\n\fwhich factors through Gi inducing the tautological representation of Gi on V (i). From\nthe proof of 4.5.6.1 we get:\nCorollary. If Gi is of some Bn Lie type, \u2200i \u2208 Hnc , then the absolute stratification\nof Nk(v) is the intersection of the \u03c1\u0303i -stratifications, i \u2208 Hnc .\nB. On the other hand, 4.5.6.1 does not necessarily hold for the case when Gad has\nsimple factors of An Lie type, with n \u2265 2, or of Dn Lie type, with n \u2265 4. Here is a\nvery simple example, in the abstract context of Shimura \u03c3k -crystals involving the A3 Lie\ntype: the proof of 4.12.12 (cf. also 4.12.12.6) below, tells us that this abstract context\ncan be easily adapted to the context of a SHS. Let (M\u0303 , F 1 (M\u0303 ), \u03c6\u0303, GL(M\u0303)) be a Shimura\nfiltered \u03c3k -crystal over k = k\u0304, with M\u0303 (resp. F 1 (M\u0303 )) of rank 4 (resp. of rank 2). Let\ng1 , g2 \u2208 GL(M\u0303 ) be such that:\n\u2013 (M\u0303 , g1 \u03c6\u0303) has slope\n\u2013 (M\u0303 , g2 \u03c6\u0303) has slope\n\n1\n3\n2\n3\n\nwith multiplicity 3 and slope 1 with multiplicity 1;\nwith multiplicity 3 and slope 0 with multiplicity 1.\n\nThe Lie isocrystals (End(M\u0303 )[ p1 ], g1 \u03c6\u0303) and (End(M\u0303 )[ p1 ], g2 \u03c6\u0303) are isomorphic. So the\nNewton polygon of\n(Lie(P SL(M )), gi\u03c6\u0303)\ndoes not depend on i \u2208 {1, 2}. Similar examples can be constructed for any other A2+m\n(resp. D3+m ) Lie type, with m \u2208 1 + 2N (resp. m \u2208 N). For examples involving the A2m\nLie types (m \u2208 N), we usually need groups over Zp whose adjoints are simple but not\nabsolutely simple.\nWarning: in many situations 4.5.6.1 remains true even if Gad has simple factors of\nad\nsome An or Dn Lie types; for instance, this is so if Gad\nZp is a split group and GR =\nSU (1, 2)ad\nR .\n4.5.7. Some sets of Newton polygons. Let y : Spec(F) \u2192 Nk(v) be an arbi\u0001\ntrary point and let M0 , \u03c60 , GW (F) be its attached Shimura \u03c3\u0304-crystal. Let N P (Nk(v) )\nbe the set of Newton\npolygons defined by \u03c3\u0304-crystals of the form (M0 , g\u03c60 ), with\n\u0001\n0\ng \u2208 GW (F) W (F) . Let LN P (Nk(v) ) be the set of Newton polygons defined by Shimura\n\u0001\n\u0001\n0\nadjoint Lie \u03c3\u0304-crystals of the form Lie(Gad\nW (F) ), g\u03c60 , with g \u2208 GW (F) W (F) . Similarly,\nwe define RLN P (Nk(v)) as the set of sequences of length |H| of Newton polygons attached to cyclic factors (their number is |H|) of the above Shimura adjoint Lie \u03c3\u0304-crystals.\nLet\nN (Gad , X ad , v ad ) := LN P (Nk(v) ) ,\nand let\nN1 (Gad , X ad , v ad ) := RLN P (Nk(v)) .\nWe also write N (Nk(v) ) = N (Gad , X ad , v ad ) and RLN P (Nk(v)) = RLN P (Gad , X ad , v ad ).\n4.5.8. Remarks. 1) The sets LN P (Nk(v) ) and RLN P (Nk(v)) and so also the natural numbers N (Gad , X ad , v ad ) and N1 (Gad , X ad , v ad ), depend only on the isomorphism\n450\n\n\fad\nad\nclass of the Shimura group pair (Gad\n: Gm \u2192 Gad\nZp , \u03bc ), where \u03bc\nW (k(v ad )) has the similar\nmeaning as \u03bc of 4.1 but associated to the Shimura variety Sh(Gad , X ad ) (cf. b) of 4.4.1\n2)). This justifies our notations and shows that the set RLN P (Gad , X ad , v ad ) can be\ndefined directly without any reference to some SHS.\n2) In \u00a710 we will use different \u03c1-stratifications of Nk(v) to compute the numbers\nN (Gad , X ad , v ad ) and N1 (Gad , X ad , v ad ).\n\n4.5.9. The quasi-affineness property. The canonical stratification of the special\nfibre Mk(v) of M (cf. [EO] and [Oo3, 7.2]; in [Oo3] is also referred as the EO stratification)\ngives birth (by pull back) to an f -canonical stratification of Nk(v) , in G(Apf )-invariant,\nreduced, locally closed, quasi-affine subschemes (as N \u2192 M is a finite morphism, Nk(v) \u2192\nMk(v) is a finite morphism). We do not deal here with the interplay between the f canonical and the canonical Lie stratifications of Nk(v) . We just mention that U is an\nopen subscheme of the open, dense stratum of the f -canonical stratification of Nk(v) , cf.\nb) or d) of 4.4.1 3), the definition of the canonical stratification of Mk(v) , and (in case\nwe do not want to use d) of 4.4.1.3) the following Exercise.\nExercise. Let (As , pAs ), s = 1, 2, be 2 principally polarized abelian varieties over\nan algebraically closed field of positive characteristic. If A1 [p] is isomorphic to A2 [p] then\n(A1 [p], pA1 ) is isomorphic to (A2 [p], pA2 ). Hint: use the classification of [EO] and [Oo3,\n7.2] and Corollary of D of 2.2.22 3).\n3.9.3 suggests that this open, dense stratum should be U itself. As the quasiaffineness is well behaved under the operations of passing to finite morphisms or to open\nsubschemes and taking quotients (via finite group actions), from [Oo3, 7.2] we get:\nCorollary. For any compact subgroup H\u03030 of G(Apf ), the G-ordinary locus of\nNk(v) /H\u03030 is a quasi-affine k(v)-scheme.\nThe interpretation of the f -canonical stratification of Nk(v) in terms of finite, flat\ngroup schemes over F annihilated by p (and liftable to W (F)) and endowed with some\nendomorphisms and principal polarizations should lead (via the use of PEL-envelopes as\ndefined in 2.3.5.3) to the definition of a refined f -canonical stratification of Nk(v) . 4.5.6.2\nB implicitly points out that in general, the refined f -canonical stratification of Nk(v) once\ndefined, can be different from the f -canonical stratification of Nk(v) .\n4.5.10. Remark. We do not stop here to prove that if y1 , y2 \u2208 Nk(v) (k) are two\ndistinct points giving birth to the same point y \u2208 Mk(v) (k), then y1 and y2 are always in\nthe same stratum, for any \u03c1-stratification of Nk(v) , as a proof of Langlands\u2013Rapoport's\nconjecture for Nk(v) in the context provided by (f, L(p) , v) (see [Mi2] and [Va2, 1.7])\nimplies that such a situation y1 \u2192 y \u2190 y2 does not occur (cf. \u00a714; to be compared also\nwith [Va2, 5.6.4] and 4.4.6).\n4.5.11. Toric points. Here k is again an arbitrary perfect field. The isomorphism\nof b) of 4.4.1 2) or just 4.2.10 leads us to define:\na) a map fG : WG \u2192 LN P (Nk(v) ) associating to \u03c9 \u2208 WG the Newton polygon\nLieG (P\u03c9 ) (of 4.1.5);\n451\n\n\fb) the set of G(\u03c9)-ordinary points y : Spec(k) \u2192 Nk(v) by the rule: the Shimura\nadjoint Lie \u03c3k -crystal attached to them, over k\u0304, are inner isomorphic to the extension to\nk\u0304 of the Shimura adjoint Lie \u03c3\u0304-crystal of C\u03c9 of 4.1.5; here inner refers to isomorphisms\ndefined by elements of Gad\nW (k) , cf. 4.2.10.\n4.5.11.1. Three open problems. If N has the completion property, then the set\nof G(\u03c9)-ordinary points is non-empty. We assume that the set of G(\u03c9)-ordinary points is\nnon-empty (in 4.12.12.6 below we prove that this is always so). The G(\u03c9)-ordinary points\nare points of a uniquely determined stratum s\u03c9 of the refined canonical Lie stratification\nof Nk(v) ; using the last part of 4.1.5.1 and the same argument as in the proof of the first\nsentence of b) of 4.4.1 3), we get that the G(\u03c9)-ordinary points are points of a uniquely\ndetermined stratum sa\u03c9 of the absolute stratification of Nk(v) .\nWe do not know (if or) when:\nALL all points of s\u03c9 (or of sa\u03c9 ) are G(\u03c9)-ordinary points, or when\nD(\u03c9) G(\u03c9)-ordinary points are points of an open, dense subscheme of s\u03c9 (or of sa\u03c9 ),\nor when\nECC (at the opposite pole) each connected component of s\u03c9 (or of sa\u03c9 ) has G(\u03c9)-ordinary\npoints.\n4.5.11.2. Definition. The points of Nk(v) with values in perfect fields which are\nG(\u03c9)-ordinary, for some \u03c9 \u2208 WG , are called toric points of Nk(v) .\n4.5.11.2.1. Exercise. Show that toric points can be defined in terms of Galois\nrepresentations: a point y : Spec(k\u0304) \u2192 Nk(v) is a toric point, iff there is a W (k\u0304)-valued\npoint z of N lifting y such that the natural p-adic Galois representation\n1\n\u03c1z : \u0393k\u0304 \u2192 GL(H\u00e9t\n(z \u2217 (A), B(k)))(Zp )\n\nfactors through the group of Zp -valued points of a maximal torus of GZp ; here we view GZp\n1\nas a subgroup of GL(L\u2217p ) and identify (cf. [Va2, top of p. 473]) L\u2217p with H\u00e9t\n(z \u2217 (A), B(k)).\nHint: use 2.2.13.3, 2.2.16.2, the Criterion of 2.2.22 1), 2.3.17 and the natural variant of\n4.2.4 with F replaced by k\u0304.\n4.5.11.3. Remark. We will see in \u00a710 that toric points are \"pillars\" of the (refined)\ncanonical Lie stratification of Nk(v) as well as of all other stratifications of 4.5.15-16 below.\nThe most important ones are the U -ordinary points introduced in 4.4.13.\n4.5.12. Problems. 1) The map fG is usually not injective. Compute the number\nof elements of its fibres.\n2) Compute the refined Lie stable p-ranks of toric points.\n4.5.13. CM levels of non-toric points. Let n \u2208 N. We consider a point y of\nNk(v) with values in a perfect field k which is not a toric point. We say y is of CM\nlevel at least n if there is a morphism z : Spec(W (k\u0304)) \u2192 N whose special fibre factors\nthrough y and whose attached Shimura filtered \u03c3k\u0304 -crystal is (see defs. of 2.2.22 1)) cyclic\n452\n\n\fdiagonalizable of level n. Based on the equivalent of 4.2.4 over k\u0304 instead of F and on\nCorollary of 2.2.22 1), the second condition on z can be restated in a more practical form\nas:\nThe truncation mod pn of the Shimura adjoint filtered Lie \u03c3k\u0304 -crystal Cz attached to\nz is isomorphic to the truncation mod pn of the extension to k\u0304 of the Shimura adjoint\nfiltered Lie \u03c3\u0304-crystal attached to any one of C\u03c9 's of 4.1.5.\nWe denote by\nn(y) \u2208 N \u222a {0, 1 + 2 dim(X)}\nthe smallest supremum of the set of those n such that y is of CM level at least n; it is a)\nof 3.15.7 K and 3.15.7 BP0 which motivates the use of 1 + 2 dim(X) here. We refer to\nn(y) as the CM level of y. Based on 2.3.17, we get that n(y) is equal to the CM level of\nits attached Shimura \u03c3k -crystal (see 3.13.7). The Expectation of 3.13.7.1 gets restated\nas: we expect that n(y) \u2265 1.\n4.5.14. Problem. Compute the number of strata and the dimensions of the connected components of the strata of the f -canonical stratification of Nk(v) introduced in\n4.5.9. The first part of this problem is a particular case of Problem 1 of H of 2.2.22 3).\n4.5.15. Other Lie type stratifications. Using the (refined) Lie stable p-ranks\nattached to points of Nk(v) with values in fields, we obtain a (refined) Lie stable stratification of Nk(v) in G(Apf )-invariant, reduced, locally closed subschemes (cf. 3.9.1.1 and\nthe part of 2.3.11 referring to G and to GH0 ). We can use as well Lie p-ranks (see 4.3.8 1))\nto define another Lie type stratification of Nk(v) ; but the refined Lie stable stratification\nis in general more refined than it.\nExample. The fact F5 of 3.10.7 points out that there are many situations when the\nstratification of Nk(v) by Lie p-ranks has only one stratum, while 4.3.5-6 point out that,\nif G is not a torus, this is not so for the refined Lie stable stratification of Nk(v) .\ndi\n\nWe have many variants: using the maps 1 \u03c8i of 4.3.7 and their variants, or their\nexterior or symmetric powers, or Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Hasse\u2013Witt (adjoint) maps, we can\ndefine a whole bunch of Lie type G(Apf )-invariant stratifications of Nk(v) . Before pointing\nout one such stratification which is very useful, we explain what we mean here by \"their\nvariants\". In 4.3.7 we have selected an absolutely simple factor of GiW (k) with the\nproperty that the F 1 -filtration of its Lie algebra defined \u2013via 4.2.10\u2013 by any W (k)morphism z : Spec(W (k)) \u2192 N , is non-zero; but we have no reason to choose one\nparticular such factor and so the choice of another one produces similar such maps (to\nbe referred as variants of the maps of 4.3.7).\nFor instance, using the ranks of images of the maps of 4.3.7 and of their variants\nand not just the ranks of their stable images, we get the Lie non-stable stratification: it\nis the intersection of as many stratifications of Nk(v) as non-compact factors of Gad\nR we\nhave. In general it is different from (in some sense unrelated to) the refined Lie stable\nstratification of Nk(v) .\n453\n\n\fHere is an example in the abstract form. We refer to 4.4.13.3.1. We choose another\nWeyl element w1 \u2208 G\u0303(W (Fp3 )) (resp. w2 \u2208 G\u0303(W (Fp3 ))) whose component in G\u03031 is the\nsame as the component of w and whose components in G\u03032 and G\u03033 are trivial (resp. whose\ncomponents in G\u03031 and G\u03032 are the same as the ones of w and whose component in G\u03033\nis defined similarly to its other two components). Then the Shimura adjoint Lie \u03c3Fp3 crystals obtained as in 4.4.13.3.1 but using these two Weyl elements have the same Lie\ndi\nstable rank (equal to 0) but their set of three maps defined as 1 \u03c8i of 4.3.7 are different\n(in the case of w2 they are all zero maps, while in the case of w1 only 2 of them are zero\nmaps).\nThere are many questions arising and which involve these Lie type stratifications (for\ninstance: how are they related?, what is the number of their strata?, when are all strata\nsmooth or quasi-affine?, etc.). To us, the most interesting ones (and so worth stating\nthem separately) are:\nQ1 ) When the connected components of a given stratum of the Lie stable stratification of Nk(v) (or of NF ) are permuted transitively by G(Apf )?\nQ2 ) Using all stratifications hinted at in this 4.5.15 or introduced in 4.5.1-5, we can\ndefine their intersection. We call it the pseudo-ultra stratification of Nk(v) . It is easy to\nsee that in general it is a significant refinement of the absolute stratification. Examples:\none example is already provided in the paragraph above referring to 4.4.13.3.1; a similar\nexample can be obtained without changing \"the type\" of the Weyl element w of 4.4.13.3.1:\nreferring to 4.4.13.3.1, if we choose a similar type of Weyl element but whose component\nin G\u03031 (or in G\u03032 ) is trivial, then this change is fully \"recorded\" by the pseudo-ultra\nstratification. Can we in some way keep accurate track of this refinement?\nQ3 ) The above stratifications are very much related to the incipient theory of deviations of 3.13: the \u03c3k -linear maps of 3.9.1 and other ones constructed naturally from them\n\u2013like the ones of 4.3.7\u2013 give birth (see above and below for samples) to a big bunch of\nstable, or of non-stable, or of anti-stable deviations of Shimura (filtered) (Lie) \u03c3k -crystals.\nWhich other type of \"points\" of Nk(v) (besides the G-ordinary ones) and of their lifts (to\nN ), can be singled out using the \u03c3k -linear maps of 3.9.1 (and eventually some deviations\nsimilar to the ones introduced in 3.13)? Can we in this way single out all toric points\n(which are not U -ordinary)?\n4.5.15.0. Anti-stability. To exemplify the ideas behind these new types of deviations and what we mean by anti-stable, we refer to 3.4.5 (so we work in a context\nmodeled on 3.9.1 and not on its simplified, i.e. reduced, form of 4.3.7). Let n, m \u2208 N\nand let I0s be a subset of I0 . As we do need to use explicitly iterates of functions, the\n\u03c3k -linear map \u03a80j of 3.4.5 is denoted here just by \u03a8j . We consider the image\n\u03a8nj (\u2295i\u2208I0s gi ) \u2282 g0\nand we take it mod pm : we get a Wm (k)-submodule Im(n,m,I0s ) of g0 /pm g0 of finite length.\nIts length l(n,m,I0s ) is called the (n, m, I0s)-deviation of the Shimura \u03c3k -crystal (M, \u03c6j , G)\nor of its cyclic factor (g0 , \u03c6j ). Similarly, for I s an arbitrary subset of the set I of the\n454\n\n\fparagraph before 3.4.0, we can define the (n, m, I s )-deviation of (M, \u03c6j , G) or of the\nShimura Lie \u03c3k -crystal (g, \u03c6j ).\nWe can \"complicate\" the situation even more, by working in a filtered context\n(M, F 1 , \u03c6j , G) and considering the intersection\nIm(n,m,I0s ) \u2229 F 0 (g0 )/pm F 0 (g0 );\nwe denote its length by l(n,m,I0s ,F 0 (g0 )) . If l(n,m,I0s ) 6= 0, let\nd(n, m, I0s, F 0 (g0 )) :=\n\nl(n,m,I0s ,F 0 (g0 ))\n.\nl(n,m,I0s )\n\nIf l(n,m,I0s ) = 0, then d(n, m, I0s, F 0 (g0 )) := 0. d(n, m, I0s , F 0 (g0 )) is called the (n, m, I0s )deviation of (M, F 1 , \u03c6j , G) or of (g0 , \u03c6j , F 0 (g0 ), F 1 (g0 )). We have logical variants when\nI0s is replaced as above by I s .\nWorking in the adjoint context, i.e. with the Shimura adjoint (filtered) Lie \u03c3k -crystal\nattached to (M, F 1 , \u03c6j , G), we similarly define such deviations: they will be denoted by\nad\nadding ad as an upper right index; like dad (n, m, I0s, F 0 (g0 )), l(n,m,I\ns , etc. 3.9.6 points\n0)\ns\nout: for any n \u2208 N and for every subset I of I we have\nad\nl(n,1,I\ns ) = l(n,1,I s ) .\n\nIf I0s 6= I0 or if I s is not stable under \u03b3, then these deviations are referred as antistable deviations. All the above type of deviations can be defined in the abstract context\nof Shimura (adjoint) (filtered) Lie F -crystals over perfect fields.\n4.5.15.1. A concrete description of the pseudo-ultra stratification of Nk(v)\nand some variants. For future references, we now include a canonical description of\nthe pseudo-ultra stratification introduced in 4.5.15 Q2 ). We consider two points y1 and\ny2 of Nk(v) with values in the same algebraically closed field k. Let (see 4.3.1)\n\u03c8\u0304j (i) = gj,i \u03c8\u0304(i)\nbe the i-th Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Hasse\u2013Witt adjoint map attached to yj , j = 1, 2, i \u2208 H.\nHere gj,i \u2208 Gi (k). For n, m \u2208 N and for a subset I s of the set Ip (Gad ) of 4.3.1.1, we can\ndefine a number ln,m,I s ,yj \u2208 N \u222a {0} as in 4.5.15.0. Using these numbers we define the\npseudo-ultra stratification of Nk(v) as follows. y1 and y2 belong to the same stratum of\nthis stratification iff the following two conditions hold:\na) They belong to the same stratum of the absolute stratification;\nb) ln,1,I s ,y1 = ln,1,I s ,y2 , for any n \u2208 N and for every subset I s of Ip (Gad ).\nIn order to define a refinement of it, we need a basic assumption (approach):\n455\n\n\fEither we assume that the below Expectation holds or we allow stratifications of Nk(v)\nin potentially infinite number of strata (see 2.1; we recall that our convention in the last\ncase is to describe the reduced, locally closed subschemes of Nk(v) or of NF defined by\nsuch a stratification S of Nk(v) , as the passage to an arbitrary k\u0304 \u2013i.e. the description of\nthe reduced, locally closed subschemes of Nk\u0304 which are implicitly part of the definition of\nS\u2013 is automatic).\nExpectation (the finiteness property). For i \u2208 H, the set of inner isomorphism\nclasses of Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Hasse\u2013Witt adjoint maps of the form (Lie(Gi k ), gi\u03c8\u03041 (i)),\nwith gi \u2208 Gi (k), is finite and does not depend on k.\nBased on 3.13.7.1, we do believe that this finiteness property always holds and that\nit can be proved (for instance) by just refining 3.5.3 slightly. Under this basic assumption we can define the ultra stratification in the same way we defined the pseudo-ultra\nstratification, by just replacing b) by the following requirement:\nc) For any i \u2208 H, \u03c8\u03041 (i) and \u03c8\u03042 (i) are inner isomorphic.\nIf we work only with c) (i.e. we do not impose a) as well), we speak about the\nquasi-ultra stratification or the Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Hasse\u2013Witt stratification of Nk(v) ; it\nis a stratification which depends only on adjoint Lie F -crystals attached to points of\nNk(v) with values in perfect fields. The argument of why c) always defines locally closed\nsubschemes of Nk(v) is presented in 4.5.15.2. The Expectation should be compared with\n[EO] (or [Oo3]), where a similar finiteness property in the context of the p-torsion of\nprincipally quasi-polarized p-divisible groups over k is used; in particular, loc. cit. implies\n(via 3.13.7.2 and 1) of 3.13.7.4 D) that the above finiteness property holds if all Gi 's of\n4.3.1 are split of some Cn Lie type.\nWe do not know what is the right connection between the quasi-ultra stratification\nand the refined canonical Lie stratification. Also, we do not know when the quasi-ultra\n(or the pseudo-ultra) and the ultra stratifications coincide.\nWarning: in what follows, whenever we refer to the (quasi-) ultra stratification, we\nimplicitly assume that we work under the above basic assumption (approach).\n4.5.15.2. Formulas pertaining to the quasi-ultra stratification. From their\nvery definition, the pseudo-ultra and the quasi-ultra stratifications are (once checked to\nexist) G(Apf )-invariant (see Fact 6 of 2.3.11). So from the part of 2.3.9 A pertaining to F\nwe get: to show that the quasi-ultra stratification of Nk(v) is well defined, we can work\nwith the quotient NF /H0 (in particular, in what follows we speak about the quasi-ultra\nstratification of Nk1 /H\u03030 for any compact subgroup H\u0303 of G(Apf ) and for every perfect field\nk1 which is either algebraically closed or is an algebraic extension of k(v)). For the sake\nof convenience we keep working with k = k\u0304.\nThe below Formula tells us that the quasi-ultra stratification is a very elementary\nconcept (i.e. it can be easily studied, using few mathematical tools). Its proof is a trivial\napplication of 2.3.15.1 (or of 3.6.14.4). We use the notations of 4.5.15.1. Let P\u0304i (y1 ) be the\nparabolic subgroup of Gi k having as its Lie algebra the F 0 -filtration of Lie(Gi k ) defined\n456\n\n\fnaturally via any lift of y1 to a W (k)-valued point of N (i.e. defined by the reduction\nmod p of the F 0 -filtration of Lie(Gad\nW (k) ) defined by any such lift; see 2.3.10 and 2.2.13).\nLet Ui be an arbitrary smooth, unipotent subgroup of Gi k such that we have a natural\nopen embedding\nUi \u0592\u2192 Gi k /P\u0304i (y1 ).\nWe denote by T0 the action we get as in 3.13.7.1 starting from the Shimura \u03c3-crystal\nassociated to an arbitrary Shimura-ordinary k-valued point of Nk(v) . It is 2.3.13.1, 4.2.1\nand b) of 4.4.1 2) which allow us to make this choice arbitrarily: we can assume that\n\u2200i \u2208 H, the i-th Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Hasse\u2013Witt adjoint map associated to any such point\nis \u03c8\u0304(i) (of 4.3.1). T0 gets decomposed into |H|-actions T0 (i), i \u2208 H: T0 (i) is the action\nof the centralizer Ci (\u03bc)k in Gi k of the image of \u03bck in Gi k on\n(SP (i))\n\nX (i) := Ni+ (\u03bc)k \\ Gi k /\u03c3(Ni\u2212 (\u03bc))k\n\ndefined by restricting T0 to Ci (\u03bc)k . Here Ni\u2212 (resp. Ni+ ) is the maximal unipotent subgroup of GiW (k(v)) with the property that \u03bc acts on its Lie algebra (via inner conjugation)\nvia the identical (resp. the inverse of the identical) character of Gm .\nWe consider the locally closed subscheme Vi (1) of Ui whose k-valued points are\nthose ui \u2208 Ui (k) such that the pairs (Lie(Gi k ), \u03c8\u03041 (i)) and (Lie(Gi k ), ui \u03c8\u03041 (i)) are inner\nisomorphic. Its existence is implied by the existence of T0 , as the condition on ui can be\nreformulated as: ui g1,i \u03c8\u0304(i) and g1,i \u03c8\u0304(i) are inner isomorphic. Let\ndi (y1 )\nbe the dimension of the connected component of Vi (1) containing the origin of Ui . For\ni \u2208 Hc , we have di (y1 ) = 0. Let z \u2208 Nk(v) (W (k)) be an arbitrary lift of y1 . Let \u00e3 and g\u1ef8\nhave the same significance as in 2.3.15.1 (applied to z, viewed as a W (k)-valued point of\nNW (k) /H0 lifting the k-valued point \u2013still denoted by y1 \u2013 of Nk /H0 defined by y1 ; so y of\n2.3.12.1 is denoted here by y1 ), with N such that its special fibre is (naturally identifiable\nwith)\nY\nUi .\ni\u2208H\n\nAs the special fibre \u00e3k of \u00e3 is an \u00e9tale morphism, we get that the image under \u00e3k of\nY\ng\u1ef8\u22121 (\nVi (1)),\ni\u2208H\n\nis a locally closed subscheme of Nk /H0 : it is the intersection of the stratum s(y1 ) of the\nquasi-ultra stratification of Nk /H0 to which y1 belongs with the image of the special fibre\nof \u00e3. So the quasi-ultra stratification of Nk /H0 is well defined and we have:\nFormula. The dimension of the stratum of the quasi-ultra stratification of Nk(v) to\nwhich y1 belongs is equal to\nX\nX\n(1)\ndF SHW (y1 ) :=\ndi (y1 ) =\ndi (y1 ).\ni\u2208H\n\n457\n\ni\u2208Hnc\n\n\f4.5.15.2.1. Variant. Using 2.3.15 instead of 2.3.15.1, we can express even better\nthe numbers di (y1 )'s. To explain this we need some more notations. Let\nd(i) := dimk (Gi k /P\u0304i (y1 ));\nfor i \u2208 Hc it is 0. Let (M1 , \u03c61 , GW (k) ) is the Shimura \u03c3k -crystal attached to y1 . From\nvery definitions we get the second equality of\n(2)\n\ndimC (X) = dd((M1 , \u03c61 , GW (k) )) =\n\nX\n\nd(i);\n\ni\u2208Hnc\n\nthe first equality is argued as in [Va2, end of 5.4.7]. We consider the group\nInn(Lie(Gik ), \u03c8\u03041 (i))\nof inner automorphisms of the i-th Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Hasse\u2013Witt adjoint map attached\nto y1 . It is an algebraic group over k. Let di (y1 ) be its dimension. We have:\nProposition. di (y1 ) + di (y1 ) = d(i), \u2200i \u2208 H.\nProof: We use the notations of 2.3.15 (as above, the resulting W (k)-valued point of\nN /H0 defined by z is still denoted by z, the lift z1 mentioned in 2.3.15 a) is as well still\ndenoted by z while its special fibre is denoted by y1 instead of y). The morphism a is of\nrelative dimension dimQ (G0Q ) \u2212 dimC (X). So the pull back of s(y1 ) to Yk is of dimension\n(3)\n\ndimQ (G0Q ) \u2212 dimC (X) + dF SHW (y1 ).\n\nThe key fact is that the special fibre of gY is \u00e9tale. We get\n(4)\n\ndimQ (G0Q ) \u2212 dimC (X) + dF SHW (y1 ) = dimk (S 0 (y1 )),\n\nwhere S 0 (y1 ) is the connected component of the origin of the maximal reduced, locally\nclosed subscheme S(y1 ) of G0k whose k-valued points are those g \u2208 G0 (k) such that \u03c8\u03041 (i)\nand g \u03c8\u03041 (i) are inner isomorphic, \u2200i \u2208 H. Defining similarly a reduced, locally closed\nsubscheme Si (y1 ) of Gi k (it is nothing else but the image of S(y1 ) in Gi k ), the connected\ncomponent of it containing the origin is the image of Si0 (y1 ) in Gi k . We get that\n(5)\n\ndimk (S 0 (y1 )) = dimk (Z(G0k )) +\n\nX\n\ndimk (Si0 (y1 )).\n\ni\u2208H\n\nCombining the above formulas (1) to (5) and splitting up the discussion in terms of i \u2208 H,\nwe get\n(6)\n\ndimk (Gi k ) \u2212 d(i) + di (y1 ) = dimk (Si0 (y1 )).\n458\n\n\fLet Zi (y1 ) be the subscheme of Si (y1 ) centralizing (via left translations) \u03c8\u03041 (i); we\nview it as a (non-necessarily reduced) group scheme over k. Si (y1 ) is invariant under\nright translations by elements of Zi (y1 )(k). The k-valued points of the quotient variety\nSi (y1 )/Zi (y1 ) are in one-to-one correspondence to the set of distinct maps h\u03c8\u03041 (i), with\nh \u2208 Gi (k), which are inner isomorphic to \u03c8\u03041 (i). As h\u03c8\u03041 (i) and \u03c8\u03041 (i) have the same kernel\nLie(P\u0304i (y1 )), \u2200h \u2208 G1 (k), an inner isomorphism between them is defined by an element\nof P\u0304i (y1 )(k) (cf. also a) of Step 2 of 3.13.7.3). So Si (y1 )/Zi (y1 ) is naturally isomorphic\nto P\u0304i (y1 )/Inn(Lie(Gi k ), \u03c8\u03041 (i)). So all connected components of Si (y1 ) have the same\ndimension and are smooth and moreover we have\n(7)\n\ndimk (Si0 (y1 )) = dimk (P\u0304i (y1 )) \u2212 di (y1 ) + dimk (Zi (y1 )).\n\nAs dimW (k) (Gi ) = dimk (P\u0304i (y1 )) + d(i), from (6) and (7) we get\n(8)\n\nd(i) \u2212 di (y1 ) \u2212 di (y1 ) = d(i) \u2212 dimk (Zi (y1 )).\n\nWe are just left to show that d(i) = dimk (Zi (y1 )). From its definition, Zi (y1 )(k)\nis formed by those elements of Gi (k) centralizing the image of \u03c8\u03041 (i). This image is\n\u22121\nisomorphic (under the inner isomorphism defined by g1,i\n) to the image of \u03c8\u0304(i). So the\nequality d(i) = dimk (Zi (y1 )) follows from a) and c) of Step 2 of 3.13.7.3. This ends the\nproof.\nRemark. The above proof shows: we can read out which stratum of the quasiultra stratification of Nk specializes to which strata by just looking at which orbits of T0\nspecialize to which orbits of it.\n4.5.15.2.2. Remark. Zi (y1 ) is connected, \u2200i \u2208 H, cf. a) of Step 2 of 3.13.7.3. So\n= Si (y1 ), \u2200i \u2208 H; so if Z(Gk ) is connected, S(y1 ) itself is connected. Moreover,\nas Si (y1 ) is smooth, \u2200i \u2208 H, we get that S(y1 ) is smooth. So, as a (resp. gY mod p) is\nsmooth (resp. is \u00e9tale), we get that s(y1 ) is smooth over k. We conclude:\nSi0 (y1 )\n\nCorollary. The strata of the quasi-ultra stratification of Nk(v) are regular and formally smooth over k(v).\n4.5.15.2.3. Inequalities. Let Pi\u2212 (\u03bc) (resp. Pi+ (\u03bc)) be the subgroup of GiW (k(v))\non which \u03bc acts via inner conjugation through the trivial and the identity (resp. the\ntrivial and the inverse of the identity) cocharacter of Gm . So Ni\u2212 (\u03bc) (resp. Ni+ (\u03bc)) as\ndefined in 4.5.15.2, is the unipotent radical of Pi\u2212 (\u03bc) (resp. of Pi+ (\u03bc)). Let \u03c9 be as in\n4.1.5. We denote by\ndi (\u03c9)\nthe dimension of the automorphism group of the i-th Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Hasse\u2013Witt adjoint map w\u03c8\u0304(i) attached to C\u03c9 .\nWe assume now that there is a k-valued point of N such that the truncation mod p\nof the Shimura adjoint filtered Lie \u03c3-crystal associated to a lift z \u2208 N (W (k)) of y, is inner\nisomorphic to the truncation mod p of the extension of the Shimura adjoint filtered Lie\n459\n\n\f\u03c3\u0304-crystal associated to C\u03c9 (of 4.1.5) to k. From the first sentence of 3.13.7.3.1, splitting\n(in our context) its statement in terms of i \u2208 H, we get\n(9)\n\ndimk (Pi\u2212 (\u03bc)) \u2212 dimk (Ni\u2212 (\u03bc)) \u2265 dimk (Pi+ (\u03bc) \u2229 w\u03c3(Lie(Pi\u2212 (\u03bc)))w\u22121 ) \u2212 di (y1 ).\n\nCombining (9) with the Proposition of 4.5.15.2.1 we get the second (the first one follows\nfrom very definitions) inequality of:\n(10) dimW (k) (w\u03c3(Ni\u2212 (\u03bc))w\u22121 \u2229 Ni\u2212 (\u03bc)) \u2264 di (y1 ) \u2264 dimW (k) (w\u03c3(Pi\u2212 (\u03bc))w\u22121 \u2229 Ni\u2212 (\u03bc)).\n4.5.15.2.4. Remarks. 1) The quasi-ultra stratification is a refinement of the Lie\nstable stratification of Nk(v) . From 4.3.4 c) we get: they both have the same open, dense\nstratum (it is U of 4.2.1).\n2) It is crucial to define quasi-ultra stratifications in terms of inner automorphisms\nand not just in terms of automorphisms: otherwise, we obtain (in general) less refined\nstratifications, as 4.5.6.2 B points out. So, 4.5.15.1 c) implies 4.5.15.1 b) but, in general,\nad\nad\nthe converse does not hold. For instance, if Gad\nZp is split and GR = SU (1, 2)R , 4.5.15.1\nb) defines only 2 strata of Nk(v) , while 4.5.15.1 c) defines 3.\n3) It is worth pointing out that in the above study of the quasi-ultra stratification\nof Nk(v) , the word Verschiebung does not show up at all (cf. also 3.13.7). So we view\nFaltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Hasse\u2013Witt adjoint maps as the adjoint Lie analogue (in any relative\ncontext pertaining to p-divisible objects with a reductive structure) of truncations mod\np of p-divisible groups over Fp -schemes, cf. 3.13.7.9.\nA great part of the theory (see 3.13.7 and above) of Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Hasse\u2013Witt\nadjoint maps can be redone (particularly see 3.13.7.1.2) entirely in terms of truncations\nmod p of Shimura \u03c3k -crystals as defined in 2.2.14; but, in the context of a SHS (f, L(p) , v),\ntill the proof of d) of 4.4.1 3) or at least of 4.2.8.1 is not written down, we can get into\ntrouble with the possibility that a connected component of NW (F) might have a special\nfibre which is not connected, and so the situation would not be satisfactorily enough.\nMoreover, the language of Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Hasse\u2013Witt adjoint maps is universal (cf.\n3.13.7.8-9; for instance it applies immediately to other classes of varieties or to the E6 ,\nE7 and Dnmixed types). Also we do believe, that the computations are much easier (transparent) in the adjoint context (not involving any Verschiebung maps).\n4) We get significantly better estimates than (9) or (10) above, if we use the noncompact Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Hasse\u2013Witt adjoint maps attached to points of Nk(v) (they\nare definable as the usual ones, starting from 3.13.7.6 and 3.9.6).\n5) In general, the inner isomorphism classes of Fontaine truncations mod p of (pull\nbacks via k-valued points) of a global deformation (over a regular, formally smooth W (k)scheme X) of a p-divisible object with a reductive structure of MF[a,b] (W (k)), do define\nlocally closed subschemes of Xk regardless of how a and b are: the proof is the same as\nin 4.5.15.2 (cf. 3.13.7.8-9). However, due to limitations explained in 3.6.8.9, presently\nwe can not say when Proposition of 4.5.15.2.1 generalizes outside (cf. 3.15.6) of the\ngeneralized Shimura context.\n460\n\n\f4.5.15.2.5. A supplement to 4.5.9. Let (My , \u03c6y , GW (k) , pMy ) be the principally\nquasi-polarized Shimura \u03c3k -crystal associated to a point y \u2208 N (k). Let C be the center\nof the centralizer of Z(G0W (k) ) in GL(My ). We first assume there is a torus C0 of C\ncontaining Z(G0W (k) ) and contained in Sp(My , pMy ). So for any g \u2208 Z(G0W (k) )(W (k))\nthe truncations mod p of (My , \u03c6y , GW (k) , pMy ) and of (My , g\u03c6y , GW (k) , pMy ) are isomorphic under an isomorphism defined by a k-valued point of C0 (cf. 3.13.7.2). As the map\nG0k (k) \u2192 Gad\nk (k) is surjective, we get that any k-valued point of the same connected component of Nk through which y factors and whose Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Hasse\u2013Witt adjoint\nmap is inner isomorphic to the one of y, maps (via the special fibre of iN of 2.3.2) into the\nsame stratum of the canonical stratification of Mk(v) as defined in [EO] (see also [Oo3];\nif y is a toric point, then the use of C0 is entirely avoidable here, cf. Fact of 3.13.7.2).\nFrom b) of 4.4.1 3) and from the Exercise of 4.5.9, we get that this remains true\neven if such a torus C0 does not exist. So, as in 4.5.9, we get that each stratum of the\nquasi-ultra stratification of Nk(v) is a quasi-affine scheme.\n4.5.15.3. Automorphism invariants. We do not assume anymore k algebraically\nclosed. Let z1 \u2208 N /H0 (k1 ) be such that the group G\u0303W (k) obtained as in 2.3.10 is GW (k)\nitself. Denoting by y1 its special fibre, let \u03c8\u03041 (i) and Inn(Lie(Gi k ), \u03c8\u03041 (i)) be as in 4.5.15.1\nand 4.5.15.2.1 (cf. 3.9.1.1). If k is infinite (resp. finite), let Hi (y1 ) be the connected\ncomponent of the origin (resp. be the trivial subgroup) of Inn(Lie(Gik ), \u03c8\u03041 (i)). The\ngroup\nauti (y1 ) := Inn(Lie(Gi k ), \u03c8\u03041 (i))(k)/Hi (y1 )(k)\nis called the i-th automorphism invariant of y1 .\nSuch an automorphism invariant can be defined for any (Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Hasse\u2013\nWitt adjoint map of a) cyclic Shimura (adjoint) Lie \u03c3k -crystal. In particular, for any\n\u03c9 \u2208 WG , we denote by auti (\u03c9) the automorphism invariant of the i-th cyclic adjoint\nfactor of the Shimura filtered \u03c3\u0304-crystal C\u03c9 -crystal of 4.1.5.\nIn case k = k\u0304, it seems to us that these invariants are unrelated to the di (y1 )'s\ndimensions introduced in 4.5.15.2. Often, auti (y1 ) can be naturally interpreted as a\nsubgroup of the group of Fp -valued points of a connected group scheme Ai (y1 ) over Fp ;\nit seems to us that even in such cases the dimension of Ai (y1 ) is unrelated to di (y1 ).\nExample. We situate ourselves in the abstract context of 3.4.5; so the E6 and E7 Lie\ntypes are also allowed. We assume I0 = I1 = {1} and k = k\u0304. With the notations of 3.5,\nwe consider the reductive subgroup P00 k of G1 k of whose Lie algebra is q\u0304\u03b51 \u2229 p\u0304\u03b51 . Using\nthe Zp -structures of 3.11.2 C, we get that it has a natural Fp -structure P00Fp and that\nit makes sense to speak about elements of q\u0304\u03b51 fixed by \u03c3. The group Inn(g0 /pg0 , \u03c8\u030400 )(k)\nis naturally identifiable with the group of elements of P00 (k) normalizing the Fp -Lie\nsubalgebra of q\u0304\u03b51 of elements fixed by \u03c3. Using the Lemma of Step 2 of 3.13.7.3 we get:\nInn(g0 /pg0 , \u03c8\u030400 )(k) is finite and is a subgroup of the group of Fp -valued points of the\nimage of P00Fp in the GL-group of this abelian Fp -Lie algebra.\n4.5.16. Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Dieudonn\u00e9 (adjoint, principal or standard)\nstratification. Again, in what follows we allow stratifications of Nk(v) in potentially\n461\n\n\fan infinite number of strata. Let n \u2208 N. We consider the equivalence relation En on the\nset of F-valued points of Nk(v) defined by the rule (again 4.2.10 allows us to use the word\ninner):\nEn y1 , y2 \u2208 N (F) are in relation En iff the truncations mod pn (see 3.9.8) of their\nShimura adjoint Lie \u03c3\u0304-crystals attached to them are inner isomorphic.\nThe case n = 1, corresponds to the equivalence relation on N (F) defined naturally\nby the quasi-ultra stratification of Nk(v) . It is easy to see that similarly, the equivalence classes of En define naturally constructible subsets of Nk(v) . We call En as the\nlevel-n Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Dieudonn\u00e9 equivalence relation on N (F); it is (cf. Fact 6 of\n2.3.11) G(Apf )-invariant and so we still denote by En the induced equivalence relation on\nN /H0 (F). We need an extra equivalence relation E\u221e on N (F):\nE\u221e y1 , y2 \u2208 N (F) are in relation E\u221e iff their Shimura adjoint Lie \u03c3\u0304-crystals attached\nto them are inner isomorphic.\nSimilarly we define the equivalence relations En (l) and E\u221e (l) on N () or on N /H0 (l),\nwith l an algebraically closed field containing k(v). Let E\u221e (k(v)) := E\u221e . We have:\nTheorem. There is a uniquely determined stratification ST of Nk(v) in G(Apf )invariant, reduced, locally closed subschemes having the following properties:\na) it has a stratum which is an open, dense subscheme of Nk(v) ;\nb) its strata are regular and quasi-affine;\nc) all connected components of a given stratum have the same dimension;\nd) If l is k(v) or an algebraically closed field containing k(v), two  \u0304l-valued points of\nNl belong to a locally closed subscheme of Nl which is a stratum of ST iff they are in\nrelation under E\u221e (l).\nProof: From 3.15.7 BP2 we get that there is n \u2208 N effectively computable and such\nthat En = E\u221e . We consider the adjoint variant Gad\nH0 of the Lie p-divisible object GH0 of\nMF[\u22121,1] (N /H0 ) introduced in 2.3.11 (cf. also the first proof of 3.6.18.7.3 A). From b)\nof 3.15.7 D and 3.15.7 E applied to it, we get: there is an affine k(v)-morphism\nm : Yk(v) \u2192 Nk(v) /H0 \u00d7 Nk(v) /H0\nof finite type such that y1 , y2 \u2208 Nk(v) /H0 (F) are in relation En iff the F-valued point\n(y1 , y2 ) of Nk(v) /H0 \u00d7 Nk(v) /H0 lifts to an F-valued point of Yk(v) . Let p1 and p2 be the\nk(v)-morphisms Yk(v) \u2192 Nk(v) /H0 naturally defined by the projections of Nk(v) /H0 \u00d7\nNk(v) /H0 on Nk(v) /H0 , s = 1, 2. So y2 is in relation E\u221e with y1 iff y2 is in the image\nIy1 of the restriction of p2 to p\u22121\n1 (y1 ). Iy1 is a constructible set. As En = E\u221e , from\nthe Theorem and Fact 4 of 2.3.11 we get that the local geometry of Iy1 in each F-valued\npoint of it is the same. So all connected components of Iy1 are regular and have the\nsame dimension; so Iy1 has a natural structure of a reduced, locally closed subscheme of\nNk(v) /H0 (and not just of a constructible set). From Fact 6 of 2.3.11 we get that the pull\nback of Iy1 to Nk(v) is G(Apf )-invariant.\n462\n\n\fThe same remains true if we work with an arbitrary algebraically closed field l\ncontaining k(v). So ST exists, is uniquely determined by d), is G(Apf )-invariant, its\nstrata are regular, and c) holds for it. The second part of a) is implied by b) of 4.4.1 2).\nThe quasi-affineness part of b) is implied by 4.5.15.2.5. This ends the proof.\n4.5.16.0. Remarks. 1) We refer to ST as the Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Dieudonn\u00e9 adjoint\nstratification of Nk(v) . Warning: its number of strata is in general infinite (cf. 3.9.7.3);\nhowever, this is not a serious handicap, as often it is easy to see that locally in the Zariski\ntopology, its strata which are locally closed subschemes of Nk are obtained as the fibres\nof a suitable finite number of fibrations.\n2) We have two main variants of the Theorem of 4.5.16. In the first (resp. second)\none we replace Shimura adjoint Lie \u03c3\u0304-crystals by Shimura (resp. by principally quasipolarized Shimura) \u03c3\u0304-crystals; the first one is stated in Theorem 6 of 1.6.3. Their proofs\nneed only one modification: in the principally quasi-polarized context, if ( \u22121\np ) = 1 we\np\ncan not say that we have G(Af )-invariant equivalence relations and so we need to choose\nH0 small enough (for instance, we need H0 such that 2.3.3 (INCL) holds). We get the\nFaltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Dieudonn\u00e9 standard (resp. principal) stratification of Nk(v) . Often we\ndrop the word standard.\nIf the homomorphism Z(GZp )(W (F)) \u2192 Z(GZp )(W (F)) that takes an element a \u2208\nZ(GZp )(W (F)) into a\u03c3\u0304(a\u22121 ) is surjective and if 4.2.8.1 holds, then the Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013\nDieudonn\u00e9 adjoint and standard stratifications of Nk(v) coincide. Moreover, if ( \u22121\np ) = \u22121\nthey also coincide with the Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Dieudonn\u00e9 principal stratification of Nk(v)\n(to be compared with the proof of Fact 6 of 2.3.11).\n4.5.16.1. The third form (i.e. the isomorphism form for a SHS) of the\npurity principle. We have:\nCorollary. The Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Dieudonn\u00e9 (adjoint) stratification satisfies the\npurity property.\nProof: It is enough to deal with the adjoint context: the arguments for the nonadjoint context are entirely the same. Let SN be the normalization of the Zariski closure\ns\u0304(y1 ) in NF /H0 of a stratum s(y1 ) of the Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Dieudonn\u00e9 adjoint stratification defined by some y1 \u2208 N (F). Let n \u2208 N be such that En = E\u221e and let m \u2208 {n, n+3}.\nLet L(m) be the reduction mod pm of the Shimura adjoint Lie \u03c3\u0304-crystal attached to y1 ;\nwe view it as an object of M[0,2](W (F)) whose underlying Wm (F)-module has a natural\nLie structure. We consider the scheme ISOm (SN ) parameterizing inner isomorphisms\nbetween:\ni) the pull back of L(m) through the natural morphism SN \u2192 Spec(F),\nm ad\nii) and the pull back of Gad\nH0 (1)/p GH0 (1), viewed without filtration, through the\nnatural morphism SN \u2192 Nk(v) .\nHere we view the pull backs of i) and ii) as F -crystals on SN in coherent sheaves\nendowed with Lie structures. ISOm (SN ) is an affine SN -schemes (even if SN is not regular): locally in the Zariski topology of SN it is constructed via evaluations at Wm (SN );\nto be compared with the proof of 3.15.7 D).\n463\n\n\fWe have a natural reduction morphism\nREDU C : ISOn+3 (SN ) \u2192 ISOn (SN ).\nWe consider the maximal reduced, closed subscheme of ISOn (SN )red through which\nREDU Cred factors. It is a quasi-finite, affine SN -scheme SNn,n+3 ; the quasi-finiteness\nfollows (via specialization) from b) of 2.2.4 B.\nFrom the part of the above proof referring to local geometry, we get that all connected\ncomponents of SNn,n+3 have the same dimension, are irreducible and normal. Moreover,\nthe number of points of each fibre of SNn,n+3 above an F-valued point of SN mapping\ninto s(y1 ) (resp. not mapping into s(y1 )) depends only on y1 (resp. is 0). Let SN n be\nthe normalization of SN in the ring of fractions RF of SNn,n+3 . From Zariski's Main\nn\nTheorem we get that SNn,n+3 is an open subscheme of SN n . As SNn,n+3\nand SN n are\nn\nn\naffine SN -schemes, the complement CO of SNn,n+3 in SN is either empty or of pure\ncodimension 1. The complement of s(y1 ) in s\u0304(y1 ) is the image of CO in s\u0304(y1 ); so it is\neither empty or of pure codimension 1. This (cf. also Exercise of 3.6.8.1.4) ends the\nproof.\n4.5.16.2. Remarks. 1) It seems to us that the types of 3.9.7 can be used as well\nto define a stratification of Nk(v) (automatically in a finite number of strata).\n2) The proof of 4.5.16.1 applies as well to give us that the quasi-ultra stratification\nof Nk(v) satisfies the purity property.\n4.5.17. Non Lie type stratifications. Forgetting the extra (Shimura) structure\nof F -crystals attached to points of Nk(v) with values in perfect fields, we can define other\n(not necessarily of Lie type!) stratifications of Nk(v) , closer in spirit to the stratifications\nof Mk(v) (like the one using p-ranks, see [NO], etc.). The slightly unpleasant feature of\nsuch stratifications of Nk(v) : very often they are not canonical (i.e. they depend on the\nSHS producing them; on the contrary the Lie type stratifications are canonical, see 4.9\nbelow) or they are not refined enough, as it can be seen through examples in which we\nhave |Hnc | \u2265 2.\n4.5.18. Artin\u2013Schreier stratifications. By the sum of two systems of equations\nin n1 and respectively in n2 variables, we mean the system of equations in n1 +n2 variables\nobtained by \"putting\" them together. Let Xp be an arbitrary reduced Fp -scheme. A\nstratification S of it in reduced, locally closed subschemes is called an Artin\u2013Schreier\nstratification (to be abbreviated as: an AS stratification), if there is m \u2208 N, such that\nlocally in the Zariski topology of Xp , S is an AS stratification obtained as in 3.6.8.1.3,\nusing quasi Artin\u2013Schreier systems of equations in m variables (see 3.6.18.4.6 A for the\ndefinition of these systems of equations). Similarly we define a refined Artin\u2013Schreier\nstratification (to be abbreviated as a RAS stratification) of Xp . The smallest such m is\ncalled the minimal degree of definition of S and is denoted by md(S). From the estimate\nof m1 in 3.6.8.1 (with l = 1) and from the end of 3.6.8.1.3 we get:\nFact. md(S) \u2212 1 is greater or equal to the minimum number of strata we get by\nrestricting S to open, affine subschemes of Xp .\n464\n\n\fExample 1. We assume Xp is a smooth, connected k-scheme and there is a quasipolarized p-divisible group (Dp , pDp ) over Xp . We consider the stratification S(Dp ) of Xp\ndefined by p-ranks of Dp over geometric points of Xp . From 3.6.18.4 B) and the moduli\nprinciple of 3.6.18.4.2 we deduce that it is a RAS stratification (we can take m to be\ndimk (Xp )rk(Dp )2 ). Using a suitable direct sum of Dp with an \u00e9tale p-divisible group of\nsufficiently high rank, based again on 3.6.18.4 B) and the moduli principle of 3.6.18.4.2,\nwe get that S(Dp ) is a RAS stratification, without assuming that Dp is quasi-polarized.\nUsing Hasse\u2013Witt invariants, we can reobtain this fact (we can take m = rk(Dp )), again\nwithout using that Dp is quasi-polarized.\nIf Xp is a connected component of Mk(v) (of 2.3.2) and we are dealing with the\nstandard principally quasi-polarized p-divisible group over it, from [NO, 4.1] we deduce\nthat this RAS stratification is as well an AS stratification.\nExample 2. The Lie p-rank stratification of Nk(v) is a RAS stratification. As in\nExample 1, this follows from 3.6.18.7.0 and Corollary of 3.6.18.7.3 (via 3.6.18.4.2).\nWarning: not always a RAS stratification is an AS stratification.\nExample 3. Let R := k[x1 , x2 ]. We consider the quasi Artin\u2013Schreier system of\nequations in 2 variables with coefficients in R defined by the equations z1 = x1 x2 z1p +x1 z2p\nand z2 = x1 x2 z1p + 2x1 z2p . The RAS stratification of Spec(R) defined by it is not an\nAS stratification: the complement of the open, dense stratum has 2 strata of the same\ndimension.\nExample 4. From 3.9.1.0, following the proof of 3.6.18.4.6 C, we get that the Lie\nstable stratification of Nk(v) is a RAS stratification. This is a particular case of the\nfollowing principle. Let q \u2208 N and let FXp be the Frobenius endomorphism of Xp . We\nq \u2217\n(F ) \u2192 F .\nconsider a locally free OXp -sheaf F together with an OXp -linear map l : FX\np\nWorking similarly to 3.9.1 we can define the stable p-ranks of l w.r.t. geometric points\nof Xp and use them to define a stratification S(Xp ) of Xp in reduced, locally closed\nsubschemes. As in the particular case, we get that it is a RAS stratification. Moreover,\n3.6.8.1.4 applies to it. Examples 1 and 2 are as well particular samples of this principle:\nusing Hasse\u2013Witt maps and their versions at the level of End's, in reduced forms similar\nto the ones of 4.3.7, we get that always a Lie p-rank (resp. a p-rank) stratification\nin a context involving Shimura p-divisible groups (resp. p-divisible groups) is a RAS\nstratification.\n\u2217\n\nq\nIn general, we can not perform the same construction, if we restrict l to FX\n(F1 ),\np\nwith F1 an OXp -subsheaf of F which locally in the Zariski topology is a non-trivial direct\nsummand: to compute similar stable ranks, we come across systems of equations of third\ntype (see 3.6.8.9) and so (see 3.6.8.9.0) in general they can not be used to define (following\nthe pattern of 3.6.8.1.3) stratifications of Xp .\n\nExample 5. We assume Xp is regular. Using systems of equations of the form\nxi = fi xpi ,\n465\n\n\fi = 1, m, with fi 's as elements of some Fp -algebras of global sections of open, affine\nsubschemes of Xp , we get that the natural stratification of Xp defined by any divisor of\nit with normal crossings, is a RAS stratification. Warning: Example 3 shows that not all\nRAS stratifications of an Fp -scheme can be obtained in such a way, i.e. starting from a\ndivisor with normal crossings.\nExample 6. We consider two quasi Artin\u2013Schreier systems of equations S1 and\nS2 with coefficients in a reduced Fp -algebra R; let S1 and respectively S2 be the RAS\nstratifications of Spec(R) they define. Using the sum of n1 copies of S1 with n2 copies\nof S2 , for suitable n1 , n2 \u2208 N (which depend only on the number of variables of S1 and\nS2 ), we get that the intersection S1 \u2229 S2 is a RAS stratification. We conclude: always\nthe intersection of a finite number of RAS stratifications is a RAS stratification.\n4.5.18.1. Conjecture. Always a Newton polygon stratification associated to a pdivisible group over Xp (or to a p-divisible object of some Fontaine category) is a RAS\nstratification.\nThe motivation for this Conjecture is based on:\n\u2013 examples;\n\u2013 on the proof of 3.15.10;\n\u2013 on 3.6.20 4);\n\u2013 and on the fact that taking different exterior powers of objects of MF[a,b] (\u2217),\nwe expect formulas similar to the ones of 3.6.18.4 B) and 3.6.18.7 and which involve\n(besides different pseudo-multiplicities) as well slopes which are not necessarily integral\nvalues; these different exterior powers should be able (at least in many cases; often we\nmight have to use direct sums or products as in Example 1) to \"capture the shape\" of\nFrobenius endomorphisms of (the \"involved\") vector bundles modulo higher powers of\np (we recall that in getting the formula of 3.6.18.4 B) only the value of \u03a6 mod p2 was\nimportant).\nWe have a variant of this conjecture in the context (see 3.15.7 D and E) of isomorphism classes of p-divisible objects with a reductive structure. So, using 3.6.8.1.4 we\nshould be able to reobtain the forms of the purity principle presented in 3.15.10 and\n4.5.16.1.\n4.5.18.2. Remark. One of the advantages of AS or RAS stratifications in comparison with Newton polygon stratifications is: using different determinants or norm maps,\nwe can put different natural scheme structures on the strata, which are not a priori reduced (there is always logic in the choice of m and of the quasi Artin\u2013Schreier systems of\nequations involved). For instance, referring to Example 3, the third stratum of Spec(R)\nis logically defined by the equation x21 = 0.\n4.5.18.3. Question. Is it true that locally (in the Zariski or the flat topology) a\nRAS stratification is obtained from a AS stratification by pull backs?\nWe hope to come back to the ideas of section 4.5.18 in a future paper.\n466\n\n\f4.6. Examples and main properties. Here we list the main properties of the\ntheory of Shimura-ordinary types, of G-ordinary points and of their G-canonical lifts,\nand present some examples to illustrate them as well as the complexities which arise.\nP1 \u03c4 is the (usual) ordinary type iff k(v) = Fp .\nProof: From the description of \u03c4 given in 4.1, we deduce (with the notations of\n4.1.1.1) that h0 has only the eigenvalues 0 and 1 iff h\u0304i = h\u03041 , \u2200i \u2208 S(1, d), and this is\nequivalent to \u03c3(h\u03041 ) = h\u03041 , i.e. it is equivalent to \u03bc being defined over Zp . So everything\nresults from the paragraph of 4.1 referring to [Mi3, 4.6-7].\nExample 1. In the case of a standard PEL situation (f, L(p) , v, B), if (Gad , X ad )\nis of simple Cl type, we have E(G, X) = Q; here either l \u2265 2 or l = 1 and all factors\nof Gad\nR are non-compact. So we get only usual ordinary types. Similarly, for the SHS's\ninvolving the classical Spin modular varieties of odd dimension and rank 2 considered in\n[Va2, 5.7.5], we get only usual ordinary types.\nP2 If k(v) = Fp and if y and z are as in 4.4.1 2), then z \u2217 (A) is the (usual) canonical\nlift of (cf. P1) the ordinary abelian variety y \u2217 (A).\nProof: This is a direct consequence of c) of 4.4.1 3) and of the description of the\n\u03c3-crystal (M, \u03c6) of 4.1.1 giving birth to \u03c4 .\nP3 If \u03c4 is e(1, 1), i.e. if \u03c4 is the formal isogeny type associated to supersingular\nabelian varieties of dimension e, then G is a torus.\nProof: If \u03c4 is e(1, 1), then the Shimura Lie \u03c3k -crystal attached to a G-ordinary\npoint y \u2208 Nk(v) (k) has only slopes 0. From this and 4.4.1 1) we get that the deformation\ndimension of the Shimura \u03c3k -crystal attached to y is 0. So dimC (X) = 0, cf. 4.5.15.2.1\n2). But G is a torus iff dimC (X) = 0, cf. axioms [Va2, (SV1-3) of 2.3]. This ends the\nproof.\nP4 The slopes of Shimura F -crystals attached to G-ordinary points of Nk(v) are of\nthe form di , with i \u2208 S(0, d).\nProof: This is a consequence of 4.2.1 a) and 4.1.2.2.\nExample 2. If k(v) = Fp2 and if G is not a torus, then \u03c4 is of the form r(1, 0) +\ns(1, 1) + r(0, 1), with r, s \u2208 N (cf. P1, P3 and P4).\nExample 3. We consider the case of Picard surfaces, with f the map defined in\n[Go]. If k(v) = Fp2 , then \u03c4 is 2(1, 0) + (1, 1) + 2(0, 1).\nExample 4. This is the generalization of Example 3. Let E be an imaginary\nquadratic field. Let V be a (m + n) dimensional E-vector space (with m, n \u2208 N) and let\nJV : V \u00d7 V \u2192 E be a non-degenerate hermitian form on V which has signature (m, n)\nover R. We can assume m \u2265 n. Let Sh(G, X) be the Shimura variety defined as in\n[Go], for this situation. Similarly \u0001to [Go] it can be embedded in a Siegel modular variety\nf : Sh(G, X) \u0592\u2192 Sh GSp(W, \u03c8), S with dimQ (W ) = 2(m + n). We have E(G, X) = E if\nm > n and E(G, X) = Q if m = n. Moreover Gder\nR = SU (m, n)R . We have:\n467\n\n\fFact. If v is a prime of E such that (v, 2) = 1 and k(v) = Fp2 and if (f, L(p) , v) is\na SHS, then \u03c4 is 2n(1, 0) + (m \u2212 n)(1, 1) + 2n(0, 1).\nProof: To check this we use 4.1. GW (Fp2 ) is a split group. We choose a W (Fp2 )-basis\n{e1 , ..., em+n, f1 , ..., fm+n} of M := L\u2217p \u2297Zp W (Fp2 ) such that:\n\u2013 \u03c8\u0303(ei , ej ) = \u03c8\u0303(fi , fj ) = 0, \u2200i, j \u2208 S(1, n + m), while \u03c8\u0303(ei , fj ) is 0 or 1 depending on\ni being different or equal to j;\n\u2013 the W (Fp2 )-submodule of M generated by all ei 's (resp. by all fi 's) is GW (Fp2 ) invariant;\n\u2013 there is a Borel subgroup B of GZp normalizing the W (Fp2 )-submodule of M\ngenerated by e1 ,..., ei , \u2200i \u2208 S(1, n + m), and having the property that the maximal torus\nof BW (Fp2 ) normalizing all ei 's is obtained from a torus of B by extension of scalars.\nWe consider a cocharacter \u03bc : Gm \u2192 BW (Fp2 ) which acts trivially on en+1 ,..., en+m ,\nf1 ,..., fn and as the inverse of the identical character on e1 ,..., en , fn+1 ,..., fn+m . The natural action of Gal(Fp2 /Fp ) on cocharacters of GW (Fp2 ) takes \u03bc into the cocharacter which\nacts trivially on em+1 ,..., en+m , f1 ,..., fm and as the inverse of the identical character on\ne1 ,..., em , fm+1 ,..., fn+m . Using these and 4.1, the Fact follows.\nP5 The slopes of LieG (\u03c4 ) are precisely \u22121, 0 and 1 iff G is not a torus and k(v ad ) =\nFp , where v ad is the prime of E(Gad , X ad ) divided by v.\nProof: If G is not a torus and k(v ad ) = Fp , then the image of h\u0304i in Lie(Gad\nB(k(v)) ) is\n0\nnon-zero and does not depend on i \u2208 S(1, d); so h acts on Lie(GB(k(v)) ) as h\u03041 does. So\nthe \"if\" part follows from b) of 4.4.1 2) and 4.1.1.2. If LieG (\u03c4 ) has precisely the slopes\n\u22121, 0 and 1, then G is not a torus; the fact that k(v ad ) = Fp is argued as in the proof of\nP1. This ends the proof.\n\u0001\nLet g := Lie(GW (k) ) and let g, \u03c60 , F 0 (g), F 1 (g) be the Shimura filtered Lie \u03c3k crystal attached to a G-canonical lift Spec(W (k)) \u2192 Nk(v) . From P5 and F2 of 3.10.7\nwe get:\nP6 p0 := W0 (g, \u03c60 ) is F 0 (g) iff k(v ad ) = Fp .\nP7 p0 can be the Lie subalgebra of a Borel subgroup of GW (k) .\nThis is equivalent to: the rank of G is equal to the number of slopes 0 of (g, \u03c60 ).\nFrom the formulas of 3.10.6 we deduce that, if this is so, then all simple, adjoint factors\nof Gad\nC are of Al Lie type, l \u2208 N. What we actually need is: any cyclic adjoint factor of\n(g, \u03c60 , F 0 (g), F 1 (g)) has maximal A-spreading (cf. F3 of 3.10.7).\nConcrete example. Let F be a totally real number field which is a Galois extension\nof Q. Let G\u0303 be an absolutely simple, adjoint group over F of Al Lie type, l \u2265 2, such\nQ[ l+1\n2 ]\nthat denoting Gad := ResF/Q G\u0303, Gad\nR is the adjoint group of\ni=1 SU (i, l + 1 \u2212 i)R . So\n]. We assume the existence of a prime w1 of F unramified over a rational\n[F : Q] = [ l+1\n2\nprime p > 2 and such that:\n468\n\n\f\u2013 G\u0303 is unramified over Qp ,\n\u2013 w1 is the only prime of F over p, and\n\u2013 G\u0303 over the completion Fw1 of F w.r.t. w1 is non-split.\nWe consider an arbitrary Shimura pair of the form (Gad , X ad ). Its reflex field\nE(G , X ad ) is a totally imaginary extension of F . Let w be a prime of it dividing\nw1 . We have [k(w) : k(w1 )] = 2. Argument: G\u0303 splits over the unramified quadratic\nextension of Fw1 (cf. Fact 1 of 4.3.6) and so this degree is at most 2; on the other hand,\ndue to the assumed non-trivial involution, it can not be 1.\nad\n\nSo, from F3 of 3.10.7 we get that for any SHS (f, L(p) , v), with v dividing w and\nf : (G, X) \u0592\u2192 (GSp(W, \u03c8), S), P7 holds. Such a SHS does exist cf. [Va2, 6.4.2] and 3.2.6;\nfor p = 3 cf. also 2.3.5.1.\nExample 5. P7 holds for the case considered in Example 3.\nExample 6. If in Example 4 we have m + n \u2265 4, then p0 is not the Lie subalgebra\nof a Borel subgroup. If m = n, then LieG (\u03c4 ) is always an ordinary type.\nP8 For any rational number r = a/d, with a \u2208 S(1, d), there are situations when\nthe slopes of Shimura Lie F -crystals attached to G-ordinary points of Nk(v) are precisely\n\u2212r, 0 and r.\nProof: We take (G, X) to be of Bl (or Cl or DlR ) type and such that Gad =\nResF/Q G1 , with F a totally real number field satisfying [F : Q] = d and with G1 an\nabsolutely simple F -group. We assume that for precisely a-embeddings of F into R, G1R\nis non-compact. We also assume the existence of a prime v of E(G, X) = F (cf. [De2,\n2.3.12]) such that k(v) = Fpd , with p > 2 a prime for which G is unramified over Qp . Now\nfor a SHS (f, L(p) , v) (cf. [Va2, 6.4.2] for p \u2265 5; see \u00a76 for p = 3) defined by an injective\nmap f : (G, X) \u0592\u2192 (GSp(W, \u03c8), S), the slopes of the Shimura Lie F -crystals attached to\nG-ordinary points of Nk(v) are precisely \u2212 ad , 0 and ad (cf. 3.10.6 i) and Case 1 of 3.10.6\niii); see also b) of 4.4.1 2)).\n\u2200r \u2208 Q \u2229 (0, 1], we can choose a number field F and a reductive group G1 over F\nsuch that the above assumptions are satisfied. For instance, if we are dealing with the\nBl type, fixing F subject to the above requirements, we can take G1 to be the SO-group\nof the quadratic form a1 x21 + a2 x22 + x23 + x24 + ...x22l+1 in 2l + 1 variables over F , with\na1 , a2 \u2208 F such that (cf. approximation theory) for precisely a (resp. d \u2212 a) embeddings\nF \u0592\u2192 R, they are both negative (resp. positive). Starting from 3.10.6 iii) and iv), we can\nconstruct examples for P8 with (G, X) of Al or DlH type; we leave this to the reader.\nP9 If the slopes of Shimura F -crystals attached to G-ordinary points of Nk(v) are\nrational numbers of the interval (0, 1), then no cyclic factor of the Shimura adjoint Lie\n\u03c3k\u0304 -crystal attached to a k\u0304-valued G-ordinary point of Nk(v) is totally non-compact (see\ndef. 3.10.5). The converse of this is not true.\nProof: The first part is a direct consequence of F5 of 3.10.7. The second part can\nbe seen through trivial examples.\n469\n\n\fAs a corollary we get:\nP10 If there is a totally non-compact cyclic factor of the Shimura adjoint Lie \u03c3\u0304crystal attached to an F-valued G-ordinary point of Nk(v) , then the abelian varieties obtained by pulling back A through G-ordinary points with values in algebraically closed\nfields, have non-zero p-ranks.\nFor future references we now include an extra elementary property. We assume that\nthe representation GC \u2192 GL(W \u2297Q C) is irreducible. So Gad\nR has only 1 simple, noncompact factor. Let nf be the number of simple factors of Gad\nR . It is well known that\nad\nit is an odd number, that G is a simple Q\u2013group, and that 2e is an nf -th power of a\nnatural number (for instance, see [Pi, \u00a74]). We refer to 4.3.1. Hnc has only 1 element;\nwe denote it by i. As Gab = Gm , we have E(Gad , X ad ) = E(G, X). As Gad\nR has only 1\nsimple, non-compact factor, di |d; so d \u2208 {di , 2di } (cf. Fact 1 of 4.3.6).\nP11 The abelian varieties obtained by pulling back A through G-ordinary points with\nvalues in algebraically closed fields, have non-zero p-ranks: in case d = di (resp. in case\n\u0001d\ne\nm+1\ne\n(resp. are 2d\u22121\nd = 2di ), these p-ranks are equal to 2d\u22121\n(2m+1) ; here m \u2208 N is such\nthat Gad is of A2m+1 Lie type). So, these p-ranks are 1 precisely in the case when Gad\nQp\nis a simple Qp -group of A1 Lie type.\nProof: Based on 4.2.1 a), we can work in the context of 4.1.1. The faithful representation of Gder\nB(F) on M \u2297W (k(v)) B(F) is the tensor product representation of nf\nirreducible alternating representations V1 ,..., Vnf ; here Vi 's are B(F)-vector spaces of the\nsame dimension. So we can identify M \u2297W (k(v)) B(F) with V1 \u2297B(F) V2 \u2297B(F) ... \u2297B(F) Vnf .\nThe extension \u03bcB(F) to B(F) of a cocharacter \u03bc : Gm \u2192 GW (k(v)) as in 4.1.1, acts on\nM \u2297W (k(v)) B(F) via one such irreducible representation Vi\u03bc (with i\u03bc \u2208 S(1, nf )) and so\nwe can identify \u03bc with a cocharacter of GL(Vi\u03bc ). Moreover, Gal(F) acts on the image\nof \u03bcB(F) via its quotient Gal(k(v)/Fp ). If d = di (resp. if d = 2di ), then two different\nelements \u03b31 , \u03b32 \u2208 Gal(k(v)/Fp ) can not take this image to factor through the same irreducible representation (resp. can take this image to factor through the same irreducible\nrepresentation V\u0129\u03bc iff \u03b31 \u03b32\u22121 is the generator \u03c4\u0303 of Gal(k(v)/Fpdi ) = Z/2Z). It is convenient to identify the set Ip (Gad ) with the set SS := S(1, nf ) in such a way that for any\nj \u2208 SS, Lie(Gder\nB(F) ) acts on Vj via Lie(Gj ); here we use the notations of 4.3.1.1 with\nk = F.\nWe first treat the case di = d. We consider the natural direct sum decomposition\nVj = Vj1 \u2295 Vj0 ,\nwith Vj0 (resp. with Vj1 ) as the maximal B(F)-vector subspace of Vj on which the\nextension to B(F) of \u03c3 s \u03bc( p1 )\u03c3 \u2212s acts trivially, \u2200s \u2208 S(1, d) (resp. on which at least one\nof these \u03c3 s \u03bc( p1 )\u03c3 \u2212s 's does not act trivially). If j \u2208 Hi , then dimB(F) (Vj1 ) = dimB(F) (Vj0 ).\nSo the case di = d follows by elementary computation, once we remark that the B(F)subspace of V1 \u2297B(F) V2 \u2297B(F) ... \u2297B(F) Vnf corresponding to the slope 1 for (M \u2297W (k(v))\nW (F), \u03c6 \u2297 1) is\nan\nV1a1 \u2297B(F) V2a2 \u2297B(F) ... \u2297B(F) Vnf f ,\n470\n\n\fwhere aj is 1 or 0 depending on the fact that j is or is not in Hi , \u2200j \u2208 SS.\nIf d = 2di , then Gad is of A2m+1 Lie type, with m \u2208 N, and the irreducible representations mentioned are associated to the minimal weight \u03c9\u0304m+1 of the A2m+1 Lie type\n(for instance, see loc. cit.; see [Bou2, planche I] for weights). Similarly we get a direct\nsum decomposition\n1\n\nVj = Vj0 \u2295 Vj2 \u2295 Vj1 ,\n1\n\nwith Vj0 as above and with Vj2 and Vj1 normalized by all above mentioned cocharacters,\n1\n\nsuch that Vj0 \u2295 Vj2 is the B(F)-vector subspace of Vj perpendicular on Vj0 w.r.t. the\nalternating form on it centralized by the natural image of Lie(GjB(F) ) in End(Vj ). So\nthis case follows, via a similar trivial computation, once we remark that \u03bcB(F) (resp.\nthat the extension to B(F) of the cocharacter \u03c4\u0303 \u25e6 \u03bc \u25e6 \u03c4\u0303 \u22121 of GW (k(v)) ) is associated to\nthe first (resp. to the last) node of the Dynkin diagram of the A2m+1 Lie type: for\nm+1 nf \u2212di\nm\nm di\nj \u2208 Hi , dimB(F) (Vj1 ) = C2m\n; so the p-ranks in this case are (C2m\n) (C2m+2\n)\n=\n\u0001\nd\nm+1\ne\n.\n2d\u22121 (2m+1)\nRemark. If d = di , then using the fact that Vj1 and Vj0 have the same dimension,\nCl\n\nd\ne; here l \u2208 S(0, d), cf.\n\u2200j \u2208 Hi , we get that the number of slopes dl of \u03c4 is exactly 2d\u22121\nl\nP4. Similarly, if d = 2di , we can express the number of slopes d of \u03c4 as a sum involving\ncombinatorial numbers.\n\nExample 7: The case of curves. We assume that dimC (X) = 1, i.e. that\nG = ResF/Q G1 , with F a totally real number field and with G1 an absolutely simple\nF -group of A1 Lie type such that for exactly one embedding of F into R, G1R is a noncompact (so split) group (cf. [De2, 2.3.4]). We impose no restrictions on (Gab , X ab ). Let\n(f, L(p) , v) be a SHS defined by an injective map f : (G, X) \u0592\u2192 (GSp(W, \u03c8), S). Let v ad\nbe the prime of E(Gad , X ad ) = F (cf. [De2, 2.3.12]) divided by v.\nQ\nQ\n1\nLet Gad\nQp =\ni\u2208H ResFi /Qp Gi , where F \u2297Q Qp =\ni\u2208H Fi , with Fi an unramified\n1\nfinite field extension of Qp , and where Gi is an absolutely simple Fi -group. Let i0 \u2208 H\ncorresponding to the non-compact factor of Gad\nR . Let d0 := [Fi0 : Qp ] \u2265 1. Then\nad\n\nk(v ad ) = Fpd0\nand the slopes of the Shimura adjoint Lie F -crystal attached to a G-ordinary point of\nNk(v) are precisely \u2212 d10 , 0 and d10 ; the multiplicity of \u22121/d0 (or of 1/d0 ) is d0 , while the\n\u0001\nmultiplicity of 0 is 3 dimQ (F ) \u2212 d0 + d0 = 3 dimQ (F ) \u2212 2d0 (cf. 3.10.6 i)). So if d0 = 1\nP10 applies.\nWe assume now that moreover the representation GC \u2192 GL(W \u2297Q C) is irreducible.\nSo Gab = Gm . So E(G, X) = E(Gad , X ad ) is F itself (cf. loc. cit.). Then the p-rank of\nany abelian variety obtained by pulling back A through a G-ordinary point with values\nin an algebraically closed field, is precisely 2dimQ (F )\u2212d0 (cf. P11).\n471\n\n\f4.6.1. Complements. 1) There are plenty of examples when the Newton polygon\nof the Shimura-ordinary type of a SHS (f, L(p) , v) does not have integral slopes. Such\nexamples can be constructed starting from [Va2, 6.5.1.1] and its proof. We briefly recall\nfrom loc. cit. how we can construct them, by restricting to very particular situations.\nLet F be a totally real number field such that it has precisely one prime v dividing\np and this prime is unramified over p. We assume F 6= Q. Let E (resp. K 0 ) be a totally\nimaginary quadratic extension of F in which v splits (resp. which has precisely one prime\nw unramified over v). Let (this is reviewed in 4.6.7.1 below) G\u0303 be a simply connected\ngroup over F(p) such that:\n\u2013 it splits over E(p) ;\n\u2013 its adjoint is an absolutely simple F(p) -group of Cl Lie type;\n\u2013 all its extensions to R are either compact or split and precisely one such embedding\nis compact.\nLet (WE(p) , \u03c8\u0303) be a symplectic space over E(p) such that G\u0303E(p) = Sp(WE(p) , \u03c8\u0303). Let\n0\nL(p) := WE(p) \u2297F(p) K(p)\nand let W := L(p) \u2297Z(p) Q. In loc. cit. it is constructed a\nperfect alternating form \u03c8 : L(p) \u2297Z(p) L(p) \u2192 Z(p) and an injective map f : (G, X) \u0592\u2192\n(GSp(W, \u03c8), S), such that:\n\u2013 the Zariski closure of G in GL(L(p) ) is a reductive group GZ(p) , with Gder\nZ(p) =\nResF(p) /Z(p) G\u0303, and\n\u2013 under this identification, the representation of Gder\nZ(p) on L(p) is obtained naturally\nvia the tautological representation of G\u0303E(p) on WE(p) , and\n\u2013 we have E(G, X) = K 0 .\nWe assume that the triple (f, L(p) , w) is a SHS (for instance, this is so if p 6 |6(l + 1),\ncf. [Va2, 6.5.1.1 vi)]). We have a direct sum decomposition\nL\u2217(p) \u2297Z(p) Zp = L1p \u2295 L2p\nof GZp -modules, corresponding to the 2 primes of E dividing v. Moreover, Lsp \u2297Zp W (k(w))\nis a direct sum of [k(w) : Fp ] absolutely irreducible GW (k(w)) -modules, whose simple\nfactors are permuted transitively by \u03c3k(w) , s = 1, 2. From this and the fact that \u03bc of 4.1\nacts trivially precisely on one such simple factor (this can be read out \u2013cf. loc. cit.\u2013 from\n[De2, 2.3.9]), we get that the Shimura-ordinary type defined by (f, L(p) , w) does not have\nintegral slopes.\nThe examples hinted at above are such that the irreducible representations of the\nfaithful representation Gder\nC \u0592\u2192 GL(W \u2297Q C) involve no tensors products. So, in some\nsense, we are at the opposite pole of the situation of P11.\n2) In [Va5] we will show that the results of 4.1-6 remain true (under proper formulation) for the integral canonical models to be constructed in \u00a76 for quotients of Shimura\nvarieties of Hodge type w.r.t. large classes of non-hyperspecial subgroups.\n472\n\n\f3) We reobtained the \"ordinary theory\" for special fibres of integral canonical models\nof Siegel modular varieties, w.r.t. primes p \u2265 2 (for p = 2, cf. 4.14.3 below). In particular,\nwe obtained a completely new proof of the density (see [Kob], [NO], [FC] and [EO]) of\nordinary points in these special fibres.\n4) The whole of 4.1 as well as properties P1 to P11 above remain true under proper\nformulation in the context of Shimura F -crystals over perfect fields (cf. 3.11.2). The only\ndifference is: we have to change k(v) = Fpd (with d \u2208 N) with the degree of definition\n(= d), and k(v ad ) = Fpd0 , with the A-degree of definition (= d0 ); moreover, in P3 (resp.\nP5) we have to change the condition G is (resp. is not) a torus to any one of the equivalent\nconditions 3.2.2 a) to d) (resp. with the condition that 3.2.2 a) to d) do not hold).\n5) In particular, 4.1 and P1 to P11 can be applied to the context of abelian varieties\nwith Hodge cycles without an a priori defined principal polarization (for instance, there\nis no problem if we have a polarization which is not principal), as long as we are in a\ncontext of Shimura F -crystals over perfect fields to which we can perform 4.2.3-4 (so\nwe are in a reductive context even in the \u00e9tale Zp -context; in \u00a75 we will see that this is\nautomatically so, cf. 1.15.1).\n6) It can happen that we have two standard Hodge situations (f, L(p) , vi ), i = 1, 2,\nwith v1 and v2 dividing the same rational prime p \u2265 3, such that their attached Shimuraordinary types are different. For instance, this is the case if k(v1 ) = Fp , while k(v2 ) = Fpd ,\nwith d \u2265 2, cf. P1.\n4.6.2. An application. Let E be a number field and let A be an abelian variety\nr\nover E. Let Spec(OE\n) \u2192 Spec(OE ) be the maximal open subscheme of the spectrum of\nthe ring of integers OE of E, over which A extends to an abelian scheme Ar . Let E(A)\nbe the reflex field of the Shimura variety attached to A (cf. 2.1).\n4.6.2.1. The proof of Theorem 7 of 1.7. We now prove Theorem 7 of 1.7. So\nwe assume E(A) 6= Q. We consider an embedding E \u0592\u2192 C; let L\u0303Z := H1 (AC , Z) be the\nfirst group of the Betti homology of AC . The Mumford\u2013Tate group of A (of AC ) is a\nreductive subgroup GA of GL(L\u0303Z \u2297Z Q). There is N0 (A) \u2208 N such that for any prime\np \u2265 N0 (A), the Zariski closure of GA in GL(L\u0303Z \u2297Z Z(p) ) is a reductive group over Z(p) .\nIf also p \u2265 max{dimE (A), 5}, then (cf. [Va2, 5.8.6 and def. 5.8.1]) there is a Z(p) -well\npositioned family of tensors of T (L\u0303Z \u2297Z Z(p) ) for the group GA . Let now v be a prime of\nr\nOE\ndividing a rational prime\np \u2265 max{N0 (A), 5, dimE (A)}.\nd\nsh\nLet V := O\n(v) . So V is a finite, flat extension of V0 := W (F). Let AV be the abelian\nr\nvariety over V , obtained from Ar through the logical morphism Spec(V ) \u2192 Spec(OE\n).\n1\nAll Hodge cycles of AV are defined over V1 [ p ], with V1 a finite, flat, DVR extension of V\n(cf. [De4]; in fact it is very easy to see that we can take V1 = V but this is irrelevant here).\nWe choose a family (w\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J (V1 ) of Hodge cycles of AV1 such that GA is the subgroup of\nGL(L\u0303Z \u2297Z Q) fixing the Betti realizations of its members.\n473\n\n\fLet \u0113 := [V1 : V0 ]. In what follows, to simplify the presentation, we use similar\nnotations as before, though the situation is entirely unrelated to a fixed SHS. Repeating\nthe arguments of [Va2, 5.2-3], we get an abelian scheme AR\u0303\u0113 endowed with a family\n(w\u03b1 R\u0303\u0113 )\u03b1\u2208J (V1 ) of Hodge cycles over the V0 -algebra R\u0303\u0113 used in [Va2, 5.2.1], such that:\ni) through the canonical V0 -epimorphism R\u0303\u0113 \u0589 V1 defined by a choice of a uniformizer of V1 (see [Va2, 5.2]), it becomes AV1 , together with (w\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J (V1 ) ;\nii) through the canonical V0 -epimorphism R\u0303\u0113 \u0589 V0 , it becomes an abelian variety\nAV0 for which the quintuple (M, F 1 , \u03c6, GV0 , (t0\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J (V1 ) ) is a Shimura filtered \u03c3F -crystal;\n1\nhere M := Hcrys\n(AF /V0 ), F 1 is the Hodge filtration of M defined by AV0 , \u03c6 is the\nFrobenius endomorphism of M , (t0\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J (V1 ) is the family of de Rham components of the\nfamily of Hodge cycles (w\u03b10 )\u03b1\u2208J (V1 ) of AV0 obtained naturally from (w\u03b1R\u0303\u0113 )\u03b1\u2208J (V1 ) , and\nGV0 is the Zariski closure in GL(M ) of the subgroup of GL(M [ p1 ]) fixing t0\u03b1 , \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 J (V1 )\n(see [Va2, 5.3.4]).\nLet P be the Newton polygon of a (any) GV0 -ordinary \u03c3F -crystals produced by\n(M, \u03c6, GV0 ). From 3.1.0 a) we get:\n(4.6.2.1.1) The Newton polygon of the abelian variety over k(v) obtained from A by\nreduction w.r.t. v, is above P.\nLet E1 be the composite field of E and E(A) and let w be a prime of E1 dividing v.\nLet wA be the prime of E(A) divided by w. We have:\n(4.6.2.1.2) If k(wA ) 6= Fp , then P is not the Newton polygon of an ordinary type.\nThis results from 4.6 P1: the principal polarization existing in the context of a SHS\nplayed no role in obtaining 4.1 and P1 to P11 above (cf. 4.6.1 5)). It is also worth\npointing out: as the Newton polygon is an isogeny invariant, [Mu, cor. 1 of p. 234]\nallows us to assume that A is principally polarized.\nNow Theorem 7 of 1.7 is a consequence of (4.6.2.1.1-2): there are infinitely many\nprimes of E1 dividing primes of E(A) not having residue fields with a prime number of\nelements.\n4.6.2.2. Remark. We have the following precise form of Theorem 7 of 1.7. Let v\nr\nsuch that:\nbe a prime of OE\na) it divides a prime p \u2265 3 such that GA is unramified over Qp ;\nb) there is a prime w of E1 dividing v and dividing a prime wA of E(A) for which\nk(wA ) has more than p elements.\nThen A has a non-ordinary reduction w.r.t. v (and moreover there is a Newton\npolygon P of an abelian variety B over F, with dimF (B) = dimF (A), which is the Newton\npolygon of a Shimura-ordinary type \u2013pertaining to GA \u2013 which is not an ordinary type\nand such that the Newton polygon of the reduction of A w.r.t. v is above P).\n474\n\n\fThis will become transparent in the light of \u00a75-8, cf. 2.3.8 2). In [Va5] we will see\nthat in a), in most situations, we can allow p to be 2 as well.\nr\nr\n4.6.2.3. Questions. 1) Let OE\nbe the normalization of OE\nin E1 and let ArE1 be\n1\nr\nthe abelian scheme over Spec(OE\n), obtained from Ar by pull back. We do not assume\n1\nr\nE(A) is not Q. Is it true that for an infinite set of primes L of OE\n, ArE1 has a GA -ordinary\n1\nreduction which is not ordinary?\n\n2) For v as in 4.6.2.2, let (M, F 1 , \u03c6, GV0 ) be a Shimura \u03c3F -crystal constructed as in\n4.6.2.1. How is its CM -deviation (or SCM -deviation) varying in terms of v?\n4.6.2.4. Remark. Property P1 supports the ordinary conjecture.\n4.6.2.5. Remark. We regard the above non-ordinary reduction criterion as the\nnatural generalization of the (well known) fact that any abelian variety over a number\nfield E, having complex multiplication over \u0112, has a non-ordinary reduction w.r.t. an\ninfinite set of primes of E.\n4.6.2.6. Exercise. Let (f, L(p) , v) be a SHS. Let \u03c4 be the Shimura-ordinary type\nattached to it. Show that there is an infinite number of standard Hodge situations\n(f, L(q), vq ) (with vq a prime of E(G, X) dividing an odd rational prime q) which have\n\u03c4 as their attached Shimura-ordinary type. Hint: If the reflex field E(G, X) is a Galois\nextension of Q, this is obvious; now consider the Galois extension E1 (G, X) of Q generated\nby E(G, X), and use 4.1 and Tchebotarev's density theorem.\nThis simple fact makes 4.6.2.3 1) an interesting question and suggests that the ordinary conjecture should admit variants for Shimura-ordinary types, which are not ordinary.\nSee also 3.13.4 7).\n4.6.3. The case when the degree of definition is 1. For the sake of future\nreferences we point out the following two particular cases of P1 and P2.\nA. The split case. If (f, L(p) , v) is a SHS and GQp is a split reductive group, then\nthe Shimura-ordinary type we obtain is the ordinary type and the abelian varieties over\nWitt rings of perfect fields, obtained from A by pull back through G-canonical lifts of N ,\nare (usual) canonical lifts.\nB. If (f, L(p) , v) is a SHS and if an F-valued GW (F) -ordinary point of Nk(v) gives\nbirth to a Shimura \u03c3F -crystal whose degree of definition is 1, then all abelian varieties\nover W (F) obtained from A by pull back through W (F)-valued GW (F) -canonical lifts of\nN , are (usual) canonical lifts and so have complex multiplication.\n4.6.4. An application to [Va2, 6.8.6]. We consider the situation and notations\ndescribed in [Va2, 6.8.0 and 6.8.6] but we do not assume that we have a non-trivial\ninvolution (cf. end of AE.0). So E(Gad , X ad ) is a totally imaginary quadratic extension\nof a totally real number field (resp. is a totally real number field) if the involution is\nnon-trivial (resp. is trivial). We assume we are dealing with a prime v ad of E(Gad , X ad )\ndividing a prime p > 2. Also we do not assume the Q\u2013rank of Gad is positive: we just\nassume that all simple factors of Gad\nR are non-compact.\n475\n\n\fA. Exercise. Show that the criterion b) of [Va2, 6.8.2] is satisfied. Hint: the\nsituation gets reduced to a standard PEL situation; so we can use 4.4.5, the density part\nof 4.2.1 and [Mi1, 4.11-2].\nSolution. We use the notations of [Va2, 6.8]; so V0 := W (F). The idea is: any V0 valued Shimura-canonical lift z of M\u2032V0 lifts to a V0 -valued point of NV0 . If the generic\nfibre of z is a special point of the generic fibre of M\u2032V0 , then this is a consequence of [Mi1,\n4.11-2], cf. [Va2, 3.2.3.1 5)] (for the passage from K0 -valued points to V0 -valued points)\nand cf. the following Lemma.\nLemma 1. Let f1 : (T1 , {h1 }) \u2192 (T, {h}) be a cover between two 0 dimensional\nShimura pairs. Let p be an arbitrary prime such that the subtorus T0 of T1 which is\nthe kernel of f1 is unramified over Qp . Let H1p \u2282 T1 (Qp ) be a compact, open subgroup\ncontaining the hyperspecial subgroup H0p of T0 (Qp ). Let Hp be the image of H1p in T (Qp ).\nThen any K0 -valued point of ShHp ((T, {h}) lifts to a K0 -valued point of ShH1p ((T1 , {h1 }).\nProof: This is a consequence of the reciprocity map (for instance, see [Va2, 2.7])\nand of class field theory, once we remark that we have a natural identification\nT1 (Qp )/H1p T1 (Q) = T (Qp )/Hp T (Q).\nThis identification is a consequence of the fact that f1 is a cover and of the fact (see [Mi3,\n4.10]) that T0 (Qp ) = T0 (Q)H0p .\nWe are left to show that the situation gets reduced to a situation in which we know\nthat always the generic fibre of z is a special point. In other words, based on 4.4.5, we are\nleft to show that the situation gets reduced to a standard PEL situation. But this is the\nstatement of [Va2, 6.8.6], cf. end of AE.0: in what follows we present two ways to argue\nthis (and so implicitly two solutions of the Exercise), in some general forms convenient\nfor future references.\nFirst way. In what follows we mainly just recall parts of [Va2, 6.5.1.1] to explain\nthe referred statement of [Va2, 6.8.6]. Working with totally independent notations, we\nhave the following variant of 2.3.5.1 and of its p = 2 analogue.\nLemma 2. Let (G0 , X0 ) be an adjoint Shimura pair whose simple factors are of Cn\nor DnH type for some n \u2208 N. We assume G0R has no compact factors. Let p \u2265 3 (resp.\np = 2) be a prime such that G0 is unramified over Qp . Then there is an injective map\nf : (G, X) \u0592\u2192 (GSp(W, \u03c8), S), with (Gad , X ad ) = (G0 , X0 ), and there is a Z(p) -lattice L(p)\nof W good w.r.t. f , such that for any prime v of E(G, X) dividing p we get a standard\n(resp. a p = 2 standard) PEL situation (f, L(p) , v, B), for a suitable Z(p) -subalgebra B of\nEnd(L(p) ).\nProof: As in [Va2, 6.5.1], we can assume (G0 , X0 ) is a simple Shimura pair. [Va2, i)\nto v) of 6.5.1.1] tells us how to construct an injective map f : (G, X) \u0592\u2192 (GSp(W, \u03c8), S),\nwith (Gad , X ad ) = (G0 , X0 ) and how to choose a Z(p) -lattice L(p) of W good w.r.t. f ,\nsuch that, denoting by GZ(p) the Zariski closure of G in GL(L(p) ) we have:\n476\n\n\f\u2013 the derived group Gder\nV0 is a product of isomorphic semisimple groups having absolutely simple adjoints, and\n\u2013 the faithful representation Gder\nV0 \u0592\u2192 GL(L(p) \u2297Z(p) V0 ) is a direct sum of standard\nirreducible representations of rank 2n of the factors of this product.\nWarning: only [Va2, 6.5.1.1 vi)] is worked out under the assumption that p does not\ndivide the number B(G0 ) introduced in [Va2, 5.7.2]; so, as we referred to [Va2, i) to v)\nof 6.5.1.1], we do not need to assume that p does not divide B(G0 ). So in what follows\nwe take p \u2265 2.\n[Va2, 6.5.1.1] is a Z(p) -version of [De2, 2.3.10]. So, as G0R has no compact factors,\n[De2, 2.3.13] allows us to assume Gab = Gm . So the double centralizer C (i.e. the\ncentralizer of the centralizer) of Gder\nZ(p) in GL(L(p) ) is such that its extension to V0 is a\nproduct of as many copies of GL(V02n ) as factors of G0R (for p = 2 cf. also the absolutely\nirreducible part of 2.3.18 B2); moreover, the representation of CV0 on L(p) \u2297Z(p) V0 is a\ndirect sum of standard irreducible representations of rank 2n of these factors. C contains\nGZ(p) and Lie(C) is stable under the involution of End(L(p) ) defined by \u03c8. From the\nclassification of [Ko2, top of p. 375] we get that the maximal integral subgroup G1Z(p) of\nthe intersection C \u2229GSp(L(p) , \u03c8) has Gder\nZ(p) as a subgroup and its generic fibre is generated\nby Gder and by a subtori of Z(CQ ) (for p = 2 cf. also 2.3.18 B2-3); so based on [Va2,\n3.1.6 and 4.3.9] we get that G1Z(p) is reductive. So we just have to replace:\n\u2013 G by the generic fibre G1 of G1Z(p) ;\n\u2013 (G, X) by the Shimura pair (G1 , X1 ) having the property that we have a natural\ninjective map (G, X) \u0592\u2192 (G1 , X1 );\n\u2013 to replace f by the resulting injective map (G1 , X1 ) \u0592\u2192 (GSp(W, \u03c8), S).\nMoreover, we have to take B as the Z(p) -subalgebra of End(L(p) ) formed by all elements\nfixed by G1 .\nFor p \u2265 3 it is well known that the resulting quadruple (f, L(p) , v, B) is a standard\nPEL situation (for instance, cf. [Va2, 5.6.3] and AE.1; see also 2.3.6 and 2.3.8 4)). For\np = 2, it is 2.3.18 B which guarantees that the quadruple (f, L(2) , v, B) is a p = 2 standard\nPEL situation. This ends the proof of Lemma 2 and so of the first solution of the Exercise.\nSecond way. This second way is in essence just an elaboration of the first way,\nwhich from some points of view is more convenient (and precise). It is entirely detailed\nin [Va10, 3.0-1 and the paragraph after 3.1]; though [Va10] is a continuation of this paper,\nthe mentioned part of it, is entirely independent of it. However, for the convenience of\nthe reader we recall most of the details, in the following two Steps.\nStep 1. Let F be the totally real number field such that Gad is the Weil restriction\nfrom F to Q of an absolutely simple F -group G\u0303. As p is such that G is unramified over\nQp , F is unramified above p (see [Va2, 6.5.1]). Following the pattern of [Va2, 6.6.2],\nbased on [Va2, 4.3.16] and on 4.11.3 below, we can replace F (resp. G\u0303) by any other\ntotally real number field F1 unramified above p and containing F (resp. by G\u0303F1 ). To\n477\n\n\favoid forwarding, we present a second reason why we can perform this replacement: we\njust have to apply the following general Lemma to the context (of Shimura triples) of\n[Va2, 6.2.1, 6.8.0 and 6.8.6]; its notations are entirely independent of the previous ones\nand it will be needed later on in connection to Shimura varieties of special type. For the\nmeaning of EP, EEP and SEP we refer to [Va2, 3.2.3 3) and 4)].\nLemma 3. Let f1 : (G, X, H) \u0592\u2192 (G1 , X1 , H1 ) be an injective map of Shimura\ntriples. We assume that H is a subgroup of G(Qp ), with p a prime which is relatively\nprime to 2 times the order of the center of the simply connected semisimple group cover\nof G, that E(G, X) = E(Gad , X ad ) and that Gder\nand Gder\nC\n1C are products of isomorphic\nsemisimple groups whose adjoints are simple. Let f2 : (G2 , X2 , H2 ) \u2192 (G1 , X1 , H1 ) be\na cover (see defs. of [Va2, 2.4.0 and 3.2.6]), with Gder\na simply connected semisimple\n2\ngroup and with E(G2 , X2 ) = E(G1 , X1 ) (cf. [Va2, 3.2.7 10)]). Let (G\u20322 , X2\u2032 , H2\u2032 ) be an\narbitrary Shimura triple having the same adjoint as (G2 , X2 , H2 ) and such that G\u2032der\nis\n2\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\na simply connected semisimple group. We also assume that (G, X, H) and (G2 , X2 , H2 )\n\u2032\nhave integral canonical models N and respectively N2\u2032 , that N2\u2032 has the EP and that N2W\n(F)\nis quasi-projective and has the EEP. Then any Shimura triple having the same adjoint as\n(G, X, H), has an integral canonical model.\nProof: We consider, as in [Va2, 3.2.7 3)], the fibre product f3 : (G3 , X3 , H3 ) \u2192\n(G, X, H) and f32 : (G3 , X3 , H3 ) \u2192 (G2 , X2 , H2 ) of f1 and f2 . We have\nG3 := G \u00d7G1 G2 .\nThe kernel of f3 : G3 \u2192 G is the same as of f2 and so f3 is a cover. Moreover, f32 is an\ninjective map and Gder\nis a simply connected semisimple group. From the assumptions\n3\non N2\u2032 and [Va2, 6.2.3] we get that (G2 , X2 , H2 ) has an integral canonical model N2\nhaving the EP. From the proof of loc. cit. and [Va2, 3.2.14-15] we get that the connected\ncomponents of N2 and N2\u2032 are isomorphic over an \u00e9tale cover of the normalization of Z(p)\nin the composite field of E(G2 , X2 ) and E(G\u20322 , X2\u2032 ). So N2W (F) also has the EEP and is\nquasi-projective. From [Va2, 6.2.2 a)] we get that (G1 , X1 , H1 ) has an integral canonical\nmodel N1 and the natural morphism (see [Va2, 3.2.7 4)]) q2 : N2 \u2192 N1 is a pro-\u00e9tale\ncover.\nWe consider similarly the natural morphism q : N \u2192 N1 . Let q32 : N3\u2032 \u2192 N2 be\nits pull back via q2 . The resulting morphism q3 : N3\u2032 \u2192 N is a pro-\u00e9tale cover, and\nso N3\u2032 is a regular, formally smooth Z(p) -scheme. From [Va2, 3.2.14-15] we get that the\n\u2032\ngeneric fibre of q32 is a closed embedding and that q32 itself is pro-finite. N3W\n(F) has\nthe EEP, cf. [Va2, 3.2.3.1 5)]. Moreover, from [Va2, 3.2.14] we get that ShH3 (G3 , X3 )\nis naturally an open closed subscheme of the generic fibre of N3\u2032 . So the Zariski closure\nN3 of ShH3 (G3 , X3 ) in N3\u2032 is a pro-\u00e9tale cover of N (as f3 is a cover, the morphism\nShH3 (G3 , X3 ) \u2192 ShH (G, X) is \u2013see [Mi1, 4.11-13]\u2013 surjective). Again from [Va2, 3.2.3.1\n5)] we get that N3W (F) has the EEP and that N3 has the EP. So, from [Va2, 3.2.3.1 1)]\nwe get that N3 has also the SEP; this implies the existence of a natural continuous right\nG3 (Apf )-action on N3 extending the canonical one on its generic fibre. We conclude: N3\nis the integral canonical model of (G3 , X3 , H3 ).\n478\n\n\fFrom [Va2, 6.2.2-3] we get that any triple having the same adjoint as (G2 , X3 , H3 )\n(and so as (G, X, H)) has an integral canonical model. This proves Lemma 3.\nStep 2. We come back to our context of the Exercise. Based on the replacement\npart of Step 1 and on [Va10, 3.0-1 and the paragraph after 3.1], we deduce that we can\nassume we have an embedding f : (G, X) \u0592\u2192 (GSp(W, \u03c8), S) such that:\na) the adjoint pair of (G, X) is (Gad , X ad );\nb) f factors through an injective map f1 : (G1 , X1 ) \u0592\u2192 (GSp(W, \u03c8), S), which is a\nPEL type embedding (see 2.1);\nc) there is a Z(p) -lattice of W such that for any prime v1 of E(G1 , X1 ) dividing p,\nwe have a standard PEL situation (f1 , L(p) , v1 , B1 ), for a suitable Z(p) -subalgebra B1 of\nendomorphisms of L(p) ;\nd) Gad\n1 is the Weil restriction from F to Q of an absolutely simple F -group of A2l\nLie type;\ne) the Zariski closure of G in GL(L(p) ) is a reductive group.\nWe recall that the construction of [Va10, 3.0-1 and the paragraph after 3.1] is based\non four things:\nf ) standard Galois cohomology shows that by enlarging F (to F1 ) we can assume G\u0303\nis obtained by pull back from a particular (see g) below) adjoint group \u1e20 over Spec(Q);\ng) the part of [He, p. 445] referring to SO \u2217 (2n) (with n := l to fit the notations of\n[Va2, 6.8.6]) has a natural Z(p) -version and so we can take \u1e20 to be the adjoint group of\nthe generic fibre of the Z(p) -version SO \u2217 (2n)Z(p) of SO \u2217 (2n);\nh) the Z(p) -version of [Sa, 3.3]: we have as well a natural Z(p) -version SU (n, n)Z(p)\nof SU (n, n)R and a natural monomorphism SO \u2217 (2n)Z(p) \u0592\u2192 SU (n, n)Z(p) which is a Z(p) version of the standard one over R (described at the level of Lie algebras in loc. cit.);\ni) 2.3.5.1.\nComing back to properties a) to e), from [De2, 2.3.13], as Gad\nR has no compact factors,\nab\nwe deduce that we can assume G = Q. But, from the explicit construction of [Va10,\n3.0 D)] and from 2.3.5.1, as in [Va2, end of 6.6.5.1] (see also the first way above), we\ncan enlarge the center of G such that we get a standard PEL situation (f0 , L(p) , v, B0 ),\nwith f factoring through f0 : (G0 , X0 ) \u0592\u2192 (GSp(W, \u03c8), S) in such a way that we have\nad\nad\nad\nad\nad\n(Gad\n0 , X0 ) = (G , X ) (we have E(G0 , X0 ) = E(G, X) = E(G , X )). This ends the\nsecond solution of the Exercise.\nB. The types of Shimura varieties of preabelian type which are neither of abelian\ntype nor of compact type and were postponed in [Va2] (cf. [Va2, 6.8.6] and AE.0), are\namong the ones treated in A above. This (cf. also [Va2, 1.4]) proves the Second Main\nCorollary of 1.14.3.\nC. Remarks. It is worth recalling (cf. [Va2, 6.2.7]) that any naive attempt of\nhandling B just at the level of elementary arguments involving DVR's, is meaningless.\n479\n\n\fAlso, one could try to get a proof of Lemma 2 of A or to solve 2.3.5.1, starting from\nthe classification of [Sh, \u00a75]: in our opinion such an approach would be much more\ncomplicated (if successful at all).\n4.6.5. Exercise. Prove d) of 4.4.1 3) for the case k(v) = Fp . Hint: use P1, P2 and\nFontaine's comparison theory.\n4.6.6. Remark. Using the same ideas as in b) of 2.3.18 B3, d) of 4.4.1 3) follows\nimmediately for the case of a standard PEL situation. We have no problems with the D\ncases, cf. 4.2.3-4 and the following simple fact: referring to the standard PEL situation\n(f, L(p) , v, B) of 2.3.5.1, each connected component of the extension to B(F) of the intersection of GSp(W, \u03c8) with the centralizer of B in GL(W ), has a K0 -valued point which\nextends to a V0 -valued point of GSp(L(p) \u2297 V0 , \u03c8).\nUsing this, one can obtain a much simpler and shorter proof of 4.2.1 a) for standard\nPEL situations: a logical analogue of 3.1.8.1, 3.6.6.0, and [dJ1] or [Fa2, th. 10] is all that\nis needed to complete a proof of 4.2.1 a) for standard PEL situations in a very small\nnumber of pages.\n4.6.7. A digression. We consider a Shimura group pair (G0 , [\u03bc0 ]) over Zp , with\nG0 a simple Zp -group. Let q \u2208 N be the smallest number for which there is a cocharacter\n\u03bc1 : Gm \u2192 G0W (Fpq ) such that (G0 , [\u03bc0 ]) = (G0 , [\u03bc1 ]) and there is a Borel subgroup B0 of\nG0 with the property that Lie(B0W (Fpq ) ) is normalized by the image of \u03bc1 and Gm acts\non it through \u03bc1 via the trivial and the inverse of the identical cocharacters (cf. [Mi3, 4.67] and 2.2.6). We assume that the Shimura Lie \u03c3Fpq -crystal (Lie(G0W (Fpq ) ), \u03c3Fpq \u03bc1 ( p1 ))\ndefined as in 4.1.1.2 is of An , Bn , Cn , DnR or DnH type (see 3.10.5). We have:\nLemma. 1) There is a Shimura quadruple (G1 , X1 , H1 , v1 ) of adjoint, abelian type\nsuch that its attached Shimura group pair (see end of 4.1) is (isomorphic to) (G0 , [\u03bc1 ]).\n2) There is a Shimura quadruple (G1 , X1 , H1 , v1 ) of adjoint, compact, abelian type\nsuch that its attached Shimura group pair has (G0 , [\u03bc1 ]) as a product factor.\nProof: Let m be the number of simple factors of G0W (F) . So G0 is the Weil restriction from W (Fpm ) to Zp of an absolutely simple W (Fpm )-group G10 . We start (cf.\napproximation theory involving unequivalent valuations) with a totally real number field\nF1 such that [F1 : Q] = m and there is a prime v of it dividing p and with k(v) = Fpm ;\nso v is unramified above p. Let F2 be a totally real quadratic extension of Q in which p\nsplits. Let F be the composite field of F1 and F2 . We have [F : Q] = 2m. For 1) (resp.\nfor 2)) we take G1 to be the Weil restriction from F1 to Q (resp. from F to Q) of (see\nbelow) a suitable absolutely simple F1 -group (resp. F -group) G11 .\nLet F1\u2032 be the smallest Galois extension of Q containing F1 . We identify canonically\nthe quotient set Gal(F1\u2032 /Q)/Gal(F1\u2032 /F1 ) with Gal(k(v)/Fp ). So we also identify the set\nRE1\nof embeddings of F1 into R with the set of embeddings of k(v) into F. Let U be the set\nof primes of F1 which are either archimedean or are v. For w \u2208 U , we denote by F1w the\ncompletion of F1 w.r.t. w.\n480\n\n\fLet G\u03031 be the split, simple, adjoint group over F1 of the same Lie type as G0 . Let\nAut0 (G\u03031 ) be the connected component of the origin of Aut(G\u03031 ). Let Aut1 (G\u03031 ) be the\nsubgroup of Aut(G\u03031 ) defined as follows. If G0 is not of D4 Lie type, then Aut1 (G\u03031 ) is\nAut(G\u03031 ) itself. If G0 is of D4 Lie type (so Aut(G\u03031 ) is the semidirect product of Aut0 (G\u03031 )\nand of S3 ), we take Aut1 (G\u03031 ) to be the semidirect product of Aut0 (G\u03031 ) by a \u03bc2 subgroup\nof the symmetric group S3 such that the element of H 1 (Gal(F1v ), Aut(G\u03031 )F1v (F1w )) defining G10F1v is defined by an element of the image of H 1 (Gal(F1v ), Aut1 (G\u03031 )F1v (F1w )) in it\n(cf. Fact 2 of 4.3.6). Let\nH 1 := H 1 (Gal(F1 ), Aut1 (G\u03031 )(Q)).\nof\n\nWe first deal with 1). For each \u03c4 \u2208 RE1 , (in order to have 1)) the pull back G11 (\u03c4 )\nto R via it is uniquely determined by the pair\n\nG11\n\n(G10W (F) , [\u03bc1 (\u03c4 )])\nwe naturally get from (G0 , [\u03bc1 ]) via the embedding W (k(v)) \u0592\u2192 W (F) corresponding to\n\u03c4 . More precisely, G11 (\u03c4 ) is compact if [\u03bc1 (\u03c4 )] is trivial, it is a split, simple, adjoint group\nof Cn Lie type if G0 is of Cn Lie type and [\u03bc1 (\u03c4 )] is non-trivial, it is SO(2, 2n \u2212 1)R if G0\nis of Bn Lie type and [\u03bc1 (\u03c4 )] is non-trivial, etc. (see [He, p. 518]).\nIt is known that the map\nm(Aut1 (G\u03031 ), U ) : H 1 \u2192 \u2295w\u2208U H 1 (Gal(F1w ), Aut1 (G\u03031 )F1w (F1w ))\nis surjective. If Aut1 (G\u03031 ) is connected, then the surjectivity of m(Aut1 (G\u03031 ), U ) is a\nconsequence of [Mi1, B.3 and B.24]. If Aut1 (G\u03031 ) is the semidirect product of Aut0 (G\u03031 )\nand of \u03bc2 , then the surjectivity of m(Aut1 (G\u03031 ), U ) is a consequence of loc. cit. (applied\nto Aut0 (G\u03031 )) and of the structure of the Brauer group over F1 (i.e. of the fact that the\nsimilarly defined map m(\u03bc2 , U ) is surjective).\nWe deduce the existence of an absolutely simple F1 -group G11 whose pull back to\nF1v = B(k(v)) is G10B(k(v)) and whose pull back to R via \u03c4 is G11 (\u03c4 ) (if G0 is of D4 Lie\ntype we need to add that S3 is the semidirect product of \u03bc2 by a normal subgroup of it\nof order relatively prime to [C : R]; so the natural map H 1 (Gal(C/R), Aut1 (G\u03031 )(C)) \u2192\nH 1 (Gal(C/R), Aut(G\u03031 )(C)) is surjective). Let G1 := ResF1 /Q G11 .\nR\ntype, n \u2208 N, then there is a\nIf (Lie(G0W (Fpq ) ), \u03c3Fpq \u03bc1 ( p1 )) is of Cn , Bn or Dn+4\nunique way to get a G1 (R)-conjugacy class X1 of homomorphisms ResC/R Gm \u2192 G1R so\nthat (G1 , X1 ) is a Shimura pair. In general, for each \u03c4 \u2208 RE1 there are at most two\nShimura group pairs of the form (G1R , [\u03bc\u03c41 ]) (here G1R is obtained from G1 via \u03c4 ), cf.\n[De2, 1.2.7-8]. So we first choose\nY\nX1 =\nX1\u03c4\n\u03c4 \u2208RE1\n\narbitrarily such that (G1 , X1 ) is a Shimura pair; here X1\u03c4 is the G1R (R)-conjugacy\nclass of homomorphisms ResC/R Gm \u2192 G1R (defined via \u03c4 and) naturally associated\n481\n\n\fto [\u03bc\u03c41 ]. For each \u03c4 \u2208 RE1 such that the pair (G10W (F) , [\u03bc11 (\u03c4 )]) we naturally get\nfrom the triple (G1 , X1 , \u03c4 ) (here we use the identification of RE1 with Gal(k(v)/Fp ))\nis (G10W (F) , [(\u03bc1 (\u03c4 )\u22121 ]), we replace [\u03bc\u03c41 ] by [(\u03bc\u03c41 )\u22121 ]. After all such replacements we\nget that 1) holds for the prime v1 of E(G1 , X1 ) dividing p and constructed as follows.\nWe consider an embedding B(Fpq ) \u0592\u2192 C and (via it) we view E(G1 , X1 ) naturally as\na subfield of B(Fpq ); we take v1 such that W (Fpq ) is a faithfully flat O(v1 ) -algebra.\nThis takes care of 1) (we can take as H1 the hyperspecial subgroup G10 (W (Fpm )) of\nG1 (Qp ) = G11 (F1 \u2297Q Qp ) = G11 (F1v ) = G10B(Fpm ) ).\nFor 2) we proceed similarly: just one modification needs to be made. We fix an\nembedding \u03c42 of F2 into R. Let RE be the set of embeddings of F into R. We identify\nRE1 with the subset of RE corresponding to embeddings whose restriction to F2 is \u03c42 .\nFor \u03c4 \u2208 RE \\ RE1 (resp. for \u03c4 \u2208 RE1 ) we take G11 (\u03c4 ) to be compact (resp. we take it\nto be defined as above). F \u2297Q Qp is identified naturally with two copies of F1 \u2297Q Qp :\neach such copy corresponds to primes of F dividing p and a fixed prime of F2 dividing\np; identifying the two primes of F2 dividing p with the two embeddings of F2 in Qp\nand with the two emebeddings \u03c42 and \u03c42 of F2 and R, the mentioned two coppies of\nF1 \u2297Q Qp corresspond to the two disjoint subsets RE \\ RE1 and RE1 of RE. We get that\nthe Shimura group pair attached to a Shimura quadruple (G1 , X1 , H1 , v1 ) constructed as\nabove is the product of (G0 , [\u03bc1 ]) with the pair (G0 , [\u03bctriv ]) defined by the cocharacter\n\u03bctriv : Gm \u2192 G0 who has a trivial image. This ends the proof.\nCorollary 1. The extension of (Lie(G0W (Fpq ) ), \u03c3Fpq \u03bc1 ( p1 )) to F is isomorphic to the\nShimura adjoint Lie \u03c3\u0304-crystal attached to a principally quasi-polarized Shimura \u03c3\u0304-crystal\n(N, \u03c6N , GN , pN ). More precisely, (N, \u03c6N , GN , pN ) is attached to an F-valued Shimuraordinary point of N , where N is the integral canonical model of a particular SHS.\nProof: This is a consequence of 1) and of the Existence Property of 1.10. For p = 3,\ncf. also \u00a76.\nCorollary 2. All group actions T0 of 3.13.7.1 have dimk (Pk0 ) \u2212 dimk (Nk\u2212 ) =\ndimk (Pk0 ) \u2212 dd((M, \u03c6, G)) dimensional orbits.\nProof: Based on 2) and on Proposition of 4.5.15.2.1, this follows from the following\nFact.\nFact. For any SHS (f, L(p) , v), with (G, X) of compact type, the quasi-ultra stratification of Nk(v) has 0 dimensional strata.\nAs N /H0 is a projective scheme (see 2.3.3.1), the Fact follows from the quasiaffineness part of 4.5.15.2.5. From Lemma 2 of 4.6.4 A we get:\nCorollary 3. We assume the Shimura Lie \u03c3Fpq -crystal (Lie(G0W (Fpq ) ), \u03c3Fpq \u03bc1 ( p1 ))\nis either of An Lie type or is of totally non-compact Cn or DnH type. Then in the second\npart of Corollary 1 we can assume we have a standard PEL situation.\n4.6.7.1. Back to 4.6.1 1). We come back to 4.6.1 1). Let U be as in the proof\nof the Lemma of 4.6.7. Based on the mentioned proof, we deduce the existence of an\n482\n\n\fabsolutely simple F -group G\u03030F of Cn Lie types which splits over Fv and whose pull backs\nto R (via different embeddings of F ) are as desired in 4.6.1 1). G\u03030F splits above all primes\nof F but a finite set F S not containing p. For v1 \u2208 SF , G\u03030Fv splits over a quadratic\n1\nextension Ev1 of the completion Fv1 of F w.r.t. v1 . We now consider a totally imaginary\nquadratic extension E of F such that no element of F S splits in it and moreover, for\nall v1 , the completion of E w.r.t. its prime dividing v1 is Ev1 (cf. Krasner's lemma and\nthe approximation theory). We get: the pull back G\u03030E of G\u03030F to E splits at all places of\nE. So G\u03030E splits. So we can take (cf. [Va2, 3.1.3]) as G\u0303 a simply connected group over\nO(v) = F(p) having G\u03030F as the adjoint group of its generic fibre.\n4.6.8. Remark. Based on 3.13.7.4 B, to check that the finiteness property of\n4.5.15.1 holds if all simple factors of (Gad , X ad ) are of some An , Cn or DnH types, we can\nassume (cf. Corollary 3 of 4.6.7) that in 4.5.15.1 we are dealing with a standard PEL\nsituation; in such a context it is easy to check it starting from [Oo3]. We will come back\nto this in \u00a79-10.\nSo to check that the finiteness property of 4.5.15.1 holds in general, we can assume\n(cf. the above paragraph, 3.13.7.4 B and Corollary 1 of 4.6.7) that Gad\nR has no compact\nad\nad\nfactors and that (cf. also Fact 1 of 2.3.5.2) (G , X ) has all its simple factors of some\nBn or DnR type and we can proceed in many ways (like: by induction on n, or by working\nin the context of symmetric objects of MF[0,2](W (F)), etc.). However, the (presently\nabstract) context of E6 , E7 and Dlmixed types (see 3.13.7.7) can not be that easily studied\nand so we defer to \u00a710 for more of a principal approaches (then the one above relying on\nthe use of relative PEL situations in a sense similar to the one of [Va2, 4.3.16]).\n4.7. Crystalline coordinates.\n4.7.0. G-deformations. We consider an arbitrary point y : Spec(k) \u2192 N /H0 .\nLet (Ay , pAy ) := y \u2217 (AH0 , PAH0 ). By a G-deformation of (Ay , pAy ) over an artinian local\nW (k)-algebra AL having k as its residue field, we mean a deformation which is obtained\nfrom (A, PA ) by pull back via a morphism Spec(AL) \u2192 N /H0 lifting y.\n4.7.1. First properties. Let now y : Spec(k) \u2192 U/H0 be a G-ordinary point. For\nsimplifying the notations we assume y has attached to it a principally\nquasi-polarized\n\u0001\nShimura \u03c3k -crystal of the form My , \u03c6y , GW (k) , (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J \u2032 , \u03c8y (cf. 2.3.10). Let \u03bcy :\nGm \u2192 GW (k) be its canonical split (cf. 3.1.6). It produces a direct sum decomposition\nMy = Fy1 \u2295 Fy0 , with \u03b2 \u2208 Gm (W (k)) acting through \u03bcy on Fyi as the multiplication\n0\n0\nwith \u03b2 \u2212i . Let N be the subgroup of Gder\nW (k) which acts trivially on Fy and on My /Fy .\nLet R be the W (k)-algebra of the formal completion of N at the origin. We choose\nan isomorphism f \u0303 : R\u2192W\n \u0303 (k)[[x1 , . . . , xe0 ]], with e0 = dimC (X) (see [Va2, 5.4.7]). We\nare mainly interested in the case when k = k\u0304; but for a great part of what follows this\nis not needed. It is easy to see that the group N is isomorphic to Gea0 (i.e. it can be\nidentified with the group scheme defined by its Lie algebra via the exponential map). We\ncan choose the coordinates x1 , . . . , xe0 (i.e. we can choose f \u0303) such that the i-th Ga copy\nof N is Spec(W (k)[xi ]). So N as a scheme is Spec(W (k)[x1 , . . . , xe0 ]). We consider the\n483\n\n\fFrobenius lift of N which at the W (k)-algebras level takes xi \u2192 xpi , i = 1, e0 . It induces\nby completion a Frobenius lift \u03a6R of R.\nAs the case of a torus (of a 0 dimensional Shimura variety of Hodge type) is trivial,\nwe assume from now on that G is not a torus. Let N0 be the smallest connected subgroup\nof GW (k) such that:\ni) it contains N ;\nii) its Lie algebra is taken by p\u03c6y into itself.\nFor all that follows, we rely heavily on the terminology and formulas of 3.10.6. It is\neasy to see (to be compared also with 3.4.3.0 and 3.11.2 C) that:\n0) N0 is a product indexed by the number of simple factors of Gad\nQp , cf. 4.3.1.\n1) N0 is a unipotent, smooth subgroup of GW (k) .\n2) We get a Lie \u03c3k -crystal (Lie(N0 ), \u03c6y , F 0 (Lie(N0 )), F 1 (Lie(N0 ))), with F i (Lie(N0 )) :=\nF i (End(M )) \u2229 Lie(N0 ), i = 0, 1. In fact F 1 (Lie(N0 )) = {0}, and Lie(N0 ) is the Lie\nsubalgebra of Lie(GW (k) ) corresponding to negative slopes of (Lie(GW (k) ), \u03c6y ) (this\nand 1) can be read out \u2013over k\u0304\u2013 from 3.4.3.0, via 3.11.1 c); see also 3.11.2 C and\n3.10.7).\n3) N = N0 iff the slopes of LieG (\u03c4 ) are precisely \u22121, 0 and 1, cf. 2) and 4.6 P5.\n4) N0 is an abelian group iff the spreading of any cyclic adjoint factor attached to y\nis 0 or 1, cf. def. in 3.10.4.4 and 4.3.1. This automatically happens if all simple\nfactors of (Gad , X ad ) are of Bl , Cl or DlR type; but it is not necessarily true if there\nare simple factors of (Gad , X ad ) of Al or DlH type (l \u2208 N).\n5) In general, N0 is a nilpotent group of order of nilpotency not greater than some\nm \u2208 N iff the spreading of any cyclic adjoint factor attached to y is not greater than\nm (this and the first part of 4) are a consequence of the characteristic 0 analogue of\n3.5.4 (6), as it can be easily deduced from 3.10.7).\n6) N is a normal subgroup of N0 (for instance, this follows from 3.1.4).\nSo if (Gad , X ad ) has only simple factors of DlH type (l \u2208 N), then N0 has the order\nof nilpotency at most 2. If (Gad , X ad ) is a simple, adjoint Shimura variety of Al type,\nthen the order of nilpotency of N0 is smaller or equal to l and equality can hold (cf. 4.6\nP7); in fact the order of nilpotency of N0 can be any integer in S(1, l), cf. 5).\nWe also regard y as a closed embedding y : Spec(k) \u0592\u2192 NW (k) /H0 . Let \u00d4y be\nthe completion of the local ring of y in NW (k) /H0 . Let (A\u0177 , pA\u0177 ) be the principally\npolarized abelian scheme over Spec(\u00d4y ) obtained from (AH0 , PAH0 ) through the canonical\nmorphism Spec(\u00d4y ) \u2192 N /H0 . We consider the following principally quasi-polarized\nShimura filtered F -crystal\nN M\u0177\n\n:= (My , Fy1 , \u03c6y , GW (k) , N, f \u0303, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J \u2032 , \u03c8y )\n484\n\n\fover R/pR. There is a unique connection N \u2207\u0177 on My \u2297W (k) R which is integrable,\nnilpotent mod p and such that the Frobenius endomorphism\n\u03a6y := n(\u03c6y \u2297 1)\nof My \u2297W (k) R is N \u2207\u0177 -parallel, cf. 2.2.10. Here n \u2208 N (R) is the universal element\ndefined by the natural morphism Spec(R) \u2192 N ; we view it as an R-linear endomorphism\nof My \u2297W (k) R.\nSimilarly we define Gder M\u0177 , starting from a Frobenius lift \u03a6R1 of the W (k)-algebra\nW (k)\n\nR1 of the completion of Gder\nW (k) at the origin, which takes the kernel of the canonical\nW (k)-epimorphism R1 \u0589 R into itself, inducing \u03a6R on R. Let\n\u1ebd0 := dimW (k) (N0 ).\nAs a scheme N0 = Spec(W (k)[x1 , ..., x\u1ebd0 ]), while as a group scheme N0 is obtained from\nGa groups by a repeated process of forming short exact extensions defining semidirect\nproducts (cf. 1), or 5), or [SGA3, Vol. III, 4.1.2 of p. 172]). In other words, such\nan identification can be chosen so that each closed subscheme Spec(W (k)[xi ]) of N0 ,\ni \u2208 S(1, \u1ebd0 ), is a Ga subgroup of N0 , to be referred as the i-th Ga copy of N0 . Let Spec(R0 )\nbe the completion of N0 in its origin. So R0 = W (k)[[x1 , ..., x\u1ebd0 ]], with Spec(W (k)[[xi ]])\nas the completion of the i-th Ga copy of N0 in its origin, i = 1, \u1ebd0 . We choose such an\nidentification, so that (cf. also 6)) the natural epimorphism R0 \u0589 R is defined by xi goes\nto xi , if i \u2208 S(1, e0 ), and into 0, if i \u2208 S(1 + e0 , \u1ebd0 ). We assume the Frobenius lift \u03a6R1 of\nR1 is such that it also takes the kernel of the natural epimorphism R1 \u0589 R0 into itself,\ninducing a Frobenius lift of R0 which takes xi into xpi , i = 1, \u1ebd0 .\n4.7.2. Lemma. The principally quasi-polarized filtered F -crystal over Spec(\u00d4y /p\u00d4y )\nendowed with a family of crystalline tensors, defined by (A\u0177 , pA\u0177 ) and de Rham components of Hodge cycles with which A\u0177 is naturally endowed, is isomorphic to N M\u0177 .\nProof: This is a consequence of Fact 4 of 2.3.11 (via 2.2.21). For the sake\nof convenience we recall the details. As in 2.3.11, we start with a W (k)-morphism\na1\nSpec(R1 ) \u2212\u2192\nSpec(\u00d4y ) lifting the natural morphism Spec(k) \u2192 Spec(\u00d4y ) defined by\ny and such that the principally quasi-polarized filtered F -crystal over R1 /pR1 endowed\nwith tensors and associated to the pull back through a1 of (A\u0177 , pA\u0177 ) and de Rham components of the mentioned Hodge cycles of A\u0177 , is isomorphic to Gder M\u0177 . But the pull back\nW (k)\n\nof\n\nM\u0177\nGder\nW (k)\n\nb1\n\nthrough the canonical W (k)-monomorphism Spec(R) \u0592\u2192 Spec(R1 ) is\n\nN M\u0177\n\n(due to the compatibility of the Frobenius lifts of R1 and R with the W (k)-epimorphism\nR1 \u0589 R). But the W (k)-morphism c1 := b1 \u25e6a1 : Spec(R) \u2192 Spec(\u00d4y ) is an isomorphism\n(this is the same as [Va2, 5.4.7-8]). This proves the Lemma.\nWe denote by \u03a9\u0304R/W (k) the free R-module generated by dxi , i = 1, e0 . \u03a9\u0304R/W (k) is\nnaturally a direct summand of the R-module \u03a9R/W (k) . Let \u03b4N be the connection on\nMy \u2297W (k) R annihilating My .\n485\n\n\f4.7.3. Lemma. The connection\n\nN \u2207\u0177\n\nis of the form \u03b4N + \u03b2N , where\n\n\u03b2N \u2208 Lie(N0 ) \u2297W (k) \u03a9N/W (k) \u2297W (k) R = Lie(N0 ) \u2297W (k) \u03a9\u0304R/W (k) .\nProof: Similarly to N M\u0177 we define N0 M\u0177 . N M\u0177 is obtained from N0 M\u0177 by extension\nthrough the W (k)-epimorphism R0 \u0589 R. As this W (k)-epimorphism is compatible with\nthe chosen Frobenius lifts, the Lemma is a consequence of [Fa2, rm. ii) after th. 10]\napplied to (My , Fy1 , \u03c6y ) and to the subgroup N0 of GL(My ) (cf. also the formulas of\n3.6.18.4 B) and of 3.6.18.7.1).\n4.7.3.1. Notations. We write\n\u03b2N =\n\n\u1ebd0\nX\n\nnj \u2297 \u03b5j ,\n\nj=1\n\nwith {nj } a W (k)-basis of the Lie algebra of the j-th Ga copy of N0 and with \u03b5j \u2208 \u03a9\u0304R/W (k)\n(cf. 4.7.3). The elements nj , j \u2208 S(1, \u1ebd0 ), are viewed as endomorphisms of My \u2297W (k) R.\n4.7.4. Levels of complexity. Let v ad be the prime of E(Gad , X ad ) divided by v.\nTo construct (good) G-multiplicative coordinates and then to extend them to the general\ncase of 4.7.14.1 below, we distinguish five different cases (levels of complexity). They are:\nA.\nB.\nC.\nD.\nE.\n\nN = N0 .\nN0 is an abelian group different from N .\nN0 is a nilpotent group of order of nilpotency two.\nN0 is a nilpotent group of order of nilpotency greater than two.\nThe general case referred to in 4.7.14.1 below.\n\nThe condition N = N0 is equivalent to k(v ad ) = Fp , cf. 4.7.1 2) and 4.6 P5. First we\ndescribe the case A (so \u1ebd0 = e0 ); warning: 7.5-10 below refer just to this case. A quite\ngeneral theory of crystalline coordinates is elaborated in 4.7.11. In 4.7.12-18 we deal with\ndifferent aspects of it (in particular, we handle to a great extend cases B to E).\nFrom now on we assume k = k\u0304.\n4.7.5. Theorem. We assume N = N0 . We have:\ni) There is a W (k)-basis {ai |1 \u2264 i \u2264 e} of Fy0 and a W (k)-basis {bi |1 \u2264 i \u2264 e} of\n1\nFy and a permutation \u03c0 of {a1 , . . . , ae , b1 , . . . , be } satisfying the conditions:\n= 0, \u2200i \u2208 S(1, e);\nPe0\n(4.7.5.2) N \u2207\u0177 (bi ) = j=1\nnj (bi ) \u2297 \u03b5j , \u2200i \u2208 S(1, e);\n\n(4.7.5.1)\n\nN \u2207\u0177 (ai )\n\n(4.7.5.3) \u03a6y (ai ) = \u03c0(ai ) if \u03c0(ai ) \u2208 {a1 , . . . , ae };\n\n(4.7.5.4) \u03a6y (ai ) = n(\u03c0(ai )) if \u03c0(ai ) \u2208 {b1 , . . . , be };\n(4.7.5.5) \u03a6y (bi ) = p\u03c0(bi ) if \u03c0(bi ) \u2208 {a1 , . . . , ae };\n486\n\n\f(4.7.5.6) \u03a6y (bi ) = pn(\u03c0(bi )) if \u03c0(bi ) \u2208 {b1 , . . . , be }.\nFurthermore \u03b5i 's are closed 1-forms verifying the following equations:\n(4.7.5.7) If i \u2208 S(1, e) is such that \u03c0(bi ) \u2208 {a1 , . . . , ae }, then\n0=\n\ne0\nX\nj=1\n\n\u0001\n\u03c6(nj ) \u03c0(bi ) \u2297 d\u03a6R\u2217 (\u03b5j ) ;\n\n(4.7.5.8) If i \u2208 S(1, e) is such that \u03c0(bi ) \u2208 {b1 , . . . , be }, then\n\u0001\n\ndn \u03c0(bi ) +\n\ne0\nX\n\n\u0001\n\nnj \u03c0(bi ) \u2297 \u03b5j =\n\nj=1\n\ne0\nX\nj=1\n\n\u0001\n\u03c6( nj ) \u03c0(bi ) \u2297 d\u03a6R\u2217 (\u03b5j );\n\n(4.7.5.9) If i \u2208 S(1, e) is such that \u03c0(ai ) \u2208 {b1 , . . . , be }, then\n\u0001\n\ndn \u03c0(ai ) +\n\ne0\nX\n\nn nj \u03c0(ai )\n\nj=1\n\n\u0001\u0001\n\n\u2297 \u03b5j = 0.\n\nii) There are formal power series \u03bcj \u2208 B(k)[[x1 , . . . , xe0 ]], j = 1, e0 , such that:\n(4.7.5.10) \u03b5j = d\u03bcj , \u2200j \u2208 S(1, e);\n(4.7.5.11) \u2200i \u2208 S(1, e) such that \u03c0(bi ) \u2208 {a1 , . . . , ae } we have\ne0\nX\nj=1\n\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u03c6(nj ) \u03c0(bi ) d\u03a6R\u2217 (\u03bcj ) (0) = 0;\n\n(4.7.5.12) \u2200i \u2208 S(1, e) such that \u03c0(bi ) \u2208 {b1 , . . . , be } we have\n(n \u2212 1My \u2297W (k) R )(\u03c0(bi )) + p\n\ne0\nX\nj=1\n\ne0\nX\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001 \u0001\n\u03c6(p nj ) \u03c0(bi ) d\u03a6R\u2217 (\u03bcj ) (0);\nnj \u03c0(bi ) \u03bcj (0) =\nj=1\n\n(4.7.5.13) \u2200i \u2208 S(1, e) such that \u03c0(ai ) \u2208 {b1 , . . . , be } we have\n(log n)(\u03c0(ai)) +\n\ne0\nX\nj=1\n\n\u0001\nnj (\u03c0(ai ))\u03bcj (0) = 0.\n\nMoreover \u03bcj (0, ..., 0) = 0 and the series qj = exp(\u03bcj ) belongs to R and satisfies\nqj (0, ..., 0) = 1, \u2200j \u2208 S(1, \u1ebd0 ).\n4.7.6. Corollary. The elements qj \u22121 \u2208 R, j = 1, e0 , form together with p a regular\nsystem of parameters of R, i.e. the W (k)-homomorphism R \u2192 R sending xj to qj \u2212 1,\nj = 1, e0 , is an isomorphism. Moreover, if we take the Frobenius lift of R to be defined\n487\n\n\fby qj \u2192 qjp , j = 1, e0 , then the Frobenius endomorphism of the underlying R-module\nM \u2297W (k) R of N M\u0177 takes bj into p\u03c0(bj ) and takes aj into \u03c0(aj ), \u2200j \u2208 S(1, e).\n4.7.7. Definition. The elements qj \u2212 1 \u2208 R are called G-canonical or Shimuracanonical coordinates of Spec(R) or of Spf(R).\n4.7.8. Corollary. The moduli formal scheme MG (y) of G-deformations of the\nprincipally polarized abelian variety (Ay , pAy ), over (spectra of ) artinian local W (k)algebras having k as their residue field, is canonically isomorphic to the formal torus Te0\nof the completion of Gem0 in its origin; the principally polarized abelian variety over (the\nspectrum of ) W (k), obtained from (AH0 , PAH0 ) by pull back through the G-canonical lift\nof y, corresponds to the unit element of Te0 (W (k)).\n4.7.9. Corollary. We can assume that the permutation \u03c0 is trivial iff k(v) = Fp ,\ni.e. iff Ay is an ordinary abelian variety. If this is the case then the formal torus of\nG-deformations of (Ay , pAy ) is a formal subtorus of the formal torus of deformations of\nAy or of GSp-deformations of (Ay , pAy ) (i.e. of deformations of the principally polarized\nabelian variety (Ay , pAy )).\n4.7.10. About the proofs of 4.7.5-9. The proofs of 4.7.5-6 are entirely analogous\nto the proofs of [De3, 1.4.2 and 1.4.7]. As this is the only part of our work which is similar\nto the classical theory of ordinary points of special fibres of integral canonical models of\nSiegel modular varieties, here we just indicate which are the differences occurring. We do\nnot bother to mention what happens when we choose different Frobenius lifts of R (see\n[De3]).\nThe first part of b) of 4.4.1 3) guarantees that the filtered \u03c3k -crystal (My , Fy1 , \u03c6y ) is\ncyclic diagonalizable. We deduce the existence of a W (k)-basis {ai |1 \u2264 i \u2264 e} of Fy0 , of a\nW (k)-basis {bi |1 \u2264 i \u2264 e} of Fy1 , and of a permutation \u03c0 of BS := {a1 , . . . , ae , b1 , . . . , be }\nsuch that \u03c6y (bi ) = p\u03c0(bi ) and \u03c6y (ai ) = \u03c0(ai ), \u2200i = 1, e. We always make choices such\nthat if a subset of {b1 , ..., be} or of {a1 , ..., ae} is permuted cyclically by \u03c0, then this subset\nhas only 1 element.\nThe differences from [De3, 1.4] come from the fact that \u03c0 is not always the trivial\npermutation 1BS of BS.\n(4.7.5.1-2) just say what is the action of N \u2207\u0177 on the W (k)-basis BS of My , using\nthe expression of N \u2207\u0177 given in 4.7.3.1. (4.7.5.3-6) just make explicit the action of \u03a6y\non elements of BS, starting from the above expression of \u03c6y . The proof of the fact that\n\u03b5j are closed 1-forms is as in [De3, 1.4.2], starting from the fact that the connection\nN \u2207\u0177 is integrable. (4.7.5.7-9) just write down what means that \u03a6y is N \u2207\u0177 -parallel, the\nFrobenius lift of R being \u03a6R (cf. [De3, 1.1.3.3 and 1.4.2.5]; see also (E1 ) and (E2 ) of\n3.6.1.1.1 2)).\nTo see 4.7.5 ii), we follow closely the proof of [De3, 1.4.2.5 ii)]. First the Poincar\u00e9\nlemma assures the existence of formal power series \u03bcj \u2208 B(k)[[x1 , . . . , xe0 ]] such that\nd\u03bcj = \u03b5j ; they are unique up to a constant. Now (4.7.5.7-9) can be rewritten as:\n\u0010P\n\u0011\n\u0001\ne0\n(4.7.10.1) d\n\u03c6(n\n)\n\u03c0(b\n)\nd\u03a6\n(\u03bc\n)\n= 0;\nj\ni\nR\u2217 j\nj=1\n488\n\n\f\u0010\n\n\u0001\n\n\u0001\n\nPe0\n\n\u0001\n\n\u0011\n\n(4.7.10.2) d n \u03c0(bi ) + j=1 nj \u03c0(bi ) \u03bcj \u2212 \u03c6( nj ) \u03c0(bi ) d\u03a6R\u2217 (\u03bcj ) = 0;\n\u0010\n\u0001 \u0011\nPe0\n(4.7.10.3) d log n\u03c0(ai ) + j=1\nnj \u03c0(ai ) \u03bcj = 0.\n\n\u03c6(p nj ) \u2208 My \u2297W (k) R is non-zero mod p and N is an abelian group; so we have\nno problems in defining log n. The equations (4.7.10.1-3) are of similar type: they are\nobtained by taking the d-operator of linear combinations of functions; (4.7.25) is an\nequation similar to the one obtained by taking the d-operator of [De3, 1.4.2.7]. The\nvalues of \u03bcj 's at 0 are determined by the equations\nPe0 (4.7.16-18). To see why 1this is\nso, let tj := nj \u03bcj (0), j \u2208 S(1, e0 ), and let t := j=1\ntj , We have t \u2208 Lie(N )[ p ]. To\ndetermine \u03bcj (0), j \u2208 S(1, e0 ), is equivalent to determine t. The equations (4.7.16-18) can\nbe rewritten respectively as:\n\u0001\n(4.7.10.4) \u03c6(t) \u03c0(bi ) = 0;\n\u0001\n\u0001\n(4.7.10.5) \u03c6(pt) \u03c0(bi ) = pt \u03c0(bi ) ;\n\u0001\n(4.7.10.6) t \u03c0(ai ) = 0.\n\b\nLet B0 := {a1 , . . . , ae } \u222a \u03c0(ai ), . . . , \u03c0(ae ) . t acts trivially on the subspace of My\ngenerated by B0 , i.e. on Fy0 \u222a\u03c6y (Fy0 ). It is easy to see that there is a unique t \u2208 End(My )\nsuch that t(Fy0 ) = {0}, t acts trivially on My /Fy0 and 4.7.27-29 hold. Argument: \u03c6(t) \u2212 t\nis uniquely determined by these requirements and so \u03c6(t) = t; as t acts trivially on Fy0\nand My /Fy0 , we get t = 0.\nThere is another way to see that t = 0: if \u03c0 is the trivial permutation this is obvious;\nbut, as to be pointed out in 4.7.11 1) below, the situation gets reduced to such a context.\nThe last fact of ii), to prove that qj \u2208 R (obviously qj (0, ..., 0) = 1), is similar to\n[De3, 1.4.5], starting from (4.7.10.1-3) and using the element\ntR :=\n\nX\n\n1\nnj uj \u2208 Lie(N )[ ][[x1 , . . . , xe0 ]].\np\n\nThe proof of 4.7.6 is entirely analogous to the proof of [De3, 1.4.7]: we are in a\ncontext of a moduli scheme (NW (k) ) of principally polarized abelian schemes and so the\nKodaira\u2013Spencer map\ngrN \u2207\u0177 : T\u0304R/W (k) \u2192 HomR (Fy1 \u2297W (k) R, Fy0 \u2297W (k) R)\nof N \u2207\u0177 (with T\u0304R/W (k) := \u03a9\u0304\u2217R/W (k) ) is injective, having Lie(N ) \u2297W (k) R as its image (we\nhave a canonical injective W (k)-linear map Lie(N ) \u0592\u2192 HomW (k) (Fy1 , Fy0 )).\nNow 4.7.8 is obvious. The first statement of 4.7.9 is just a restatement of 4.6 P1.\nThe second statement of 4.7.9 is a particular case of the principle expressed in 4.7.17\nbelow: it is Fact 4 of 2.3.11 which allows us to be in a context involving just Shimura\np-divisible groups; it reobtains in the case of a SHS (f, L(p) , v), with k(v) = Fp , the main\nresult of [No1].\n489\n\n\f4.7.11. On the general theory of crystalline coordinates for p-divisible\ngroups over k. We itemize the ideas and results. We recall 2 is invertible in k.\n1) Based on [De3, 1.4] and on the results pertaining to a SHS and presented till\n4.7.4, the above part 4.7.5-29 is essentially trivial. What we did: we interpreted [De3,\n1.4] as a property of deformations of Shimura adjoint Lie \u03c3k -crystals. In other words, the\np-divisible group over k associated to (My , \u03c6y ) (of 4.7.1) is a direct sum of two p-divisible\ngroups Dy1 and Dy2 such that:\n\u2013 the slopes of Dy1 are precisely 0 and 1, while Dy2 does not have integral slopes;\n\u2013 the G-deformations of (Ay , pAy ) (see 4.7.0) correspond to deformations of Dy1 , while\n\"keeping\" Dy2 fixed.\nSo, if\nMy = My1 \u2295 My2\nis the direct sum decomposition corresponding to Dy1 and Dy2 , then (cf. 4.7.1 2))\nLie(N ) \u2282 End(My1 ).\nThe main goal of including 4.7.5-29 here is: to get some familiarity with the new type\nof equations (differential or not) showing up when we pass from (Shimura) ordinary \u03c3k crystals to cyclic diagonalizable Shimura \u03c3k -crystals. The equations 4.7.5.4-5, 4.7.5.7,\n4.7.5.9, 4.7.5.11, 4.7.5.13, 4.7.10.1 and 4.7.10.3 are typical to the cyclic diagonalizable\nsituation: they do not show up in the classical setting of [De3, 1.4].\n2) Let D be a p-divisible group over k. Let m be the product of the dimensions of\nD and of its dual Dt . It is known (for instance, see [Il, 4.8]; see also 4.12.13 4) below)\nthat D has a universal deformation D over\nRm := W (k)[[w1 , ..., wm ]].\nWe assume m \u2265 1. For any W (k)-epimorphism\nq : Rm \u0589 Rn := W (k)[[z1 , ..., zn]],\nwith n \u2208 N, n \u2264 m, we get naturally (from D) a p-divisible group Dq over Rn . If n = m,\nthen zi = wi , \u2200i \u2208 S(1, m).\nThe two goals. The first goal of the general problem of crystalline coordinates\n(for p-divisible groups) is to find a good description (if possible canonical) of the p\u2207\ndivisible object D(Dq ) of MF[0,1]\n(Rn ), for epimorphisms q of interest; we have freedom\n(as part of the good description) for the choice of a Frobenius lift \u03a6Rn of Rn . If we have\n\u03a6Rn (zi ) = zip (resp. \u03a6Rn (zi + 1) = (zi + 1)p ), \u2200i \u2208 S(1, n), we speak about an additive\n(resp. multiplicative) type situation. These are the most common (and handable) type\nof situations. The second goal of the problem of crystalline coordinates is to compare,\nin the case we do not have a canonical description, the different descriptions obtained in\n490\n\n\fthe process of achieving the first goal. In what follows we essentially concentrate on the\nfirst goal.\nThe extra Shimura structure. Very often the \u03c3k -crystal (M\u0303 , \u03c6\u0303) of D gets naturally the structure of a Shimura \u03c3k -crystal (M\u0303 , \u03c6\u0303, G\u0303, (t\u0303\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J \u0303 ) with an emphasized family\nof tensors, and then we take q to be the maximal formally smooth quotient of Rm preserving (in the crystalline sense of 2.2.20 AX) the tensors involved (for concrete examples see\n[Va2, 5.4-5]); so n = dd((M\u0303 , \u03c6\u0303, G\u0303)) (cf. 2.2.21 UP and 2.3.17.2). So we get a p-divisible\n\u2207\nobject with tensors Cq of MF[0,1]\n(Rn ), defined by q; forgetting the tensors it is D(Dq ).\nCq is uniquely associated to a uni plus versal Shimura p-divisible group over Rn . The\nTheorem 3.6.18.5 (as well as its relative counterparts of 3.6.18.7), in essence, achieves the\nfirst goal of the theory of crystalline coordinates. What we have to do is explained in the\nfollowing two steps.\na) First we choose, according to needs and desires, a Frobenius lift of Rn taking the\nideal In := (z1 , ..., zn) into itself, and a Frobenius endomorphism \u03a6 of M\u0303 \u2297W (k) Rn of the\nform gRn (\u03c6\u0303 \u2297 1), with gRn \u2208 G\u0303(Rn ) which modulo In is the identity. We choose also a\nfiltration F 1 (M\u0303 ) of M\u0303 such that (M\u0303 , F 1 (M\u0303 ), \u03c6\u0303, G\u0303) is a Shimura filtered \u03c3k -crystal. We\nget, as in 3.6.18, a p-divisible object with tensors\nC := (M\u0303 \u2297W (k) Rn , F 1 (M\u0303 ) \u2297W (k) Rn , gRn (\u03c6\u0303 \u2297 1), (t\u0303\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J \u0303 )\nof MF[0,1] (Rn ).\nb) We determine connections which respect the G\u0303Rn -action and make C/pC to be\n\u2207\nviewed as an object of MF[0,1]\n(Rn ). We look at the resulting Kodaira\u2013Spencer maps (one\nfor each such connection) and we pick up one such connection of whose Kodaira\u2013Spencer\nmap is injective (an isomorphism onto its image) modulo the maximal ideal (In , p) of\nRn ; the choices in a) should be made in such a way that such a connection does exist.\nThen using 3.6.18.7.0 we lift the picked up connection to a connection which respects the\n\u2207\nG\u0303Rn -action and makes C to be viewed as a p-divisible object with tensors of MF[0,1]\n(Rn ).\n\u2207\nSo C and Cq , as p-divisible objects with tensors of MF[0,1] (Rn ), are isomorphic under an\nisomorphism which mod In is the identity (cf. 2.2.21 UP). Here and in what follows, the\nrespecting of the G\u0303Rn -action is in the same sense as of 3.6.1.1.1.\nUsing these two steps a) and b), we regain (cf. 3.6.18.2) the results of [De3, 2.1],\nwithout any computational effort. After a brief digression on K3 surfaces, in 3) to 9)\nbelow we deal with cyclic diagonalizable contexts.\n2A) Digression: the case of K3 surfaces. A great part of the above ideas of\n4.7.11 and of 3.6.18 can be adapted to the context of alternating or symmetric p-divisible\nobjects of MF[\u22121,1] (Rn ) (or of MF[0,2](Rn )) which are versal (cf. also 3.6.1.6 Ph).\nBelow, as a sample, we briefly digress on the geometric context of K3 surfaces (see [Va6]\nfor general abstract contexts; see [Va12] for other geometric context: of cubic fourfolds,\netc.)\n491\n\n\fThe case of (the existence of) crystalline coordinates for the deformation space of\nan ordinary K3 surface S over an arbitrary algebraically closed field k\u0303 of characteristic\np \u2265 2, is \"settled\" by [Fa2, th. 10 and the remarks after] (see also [De3, 2.1 B] for the\ncase p \u2265 3); for p = 2, \"settled\" is used in the sense of the first goal mentioned above:\nhowever, the Fact of 4.14.3 E and 2B) below can be combined to achieve as well the\nsecond goal. [Fa2, th. 10] is not stated as such; however, starting from [De3, 2.1.6] it can\nbe checked it applies.\nTo explain this, let C (resp. C1 ) be the symmetric principally quasi-polarized, uni\nplus versal, filtered F -crystal over k\u0303[[t1 , ..., t20]] of the universal deformation space of S\nover Spf(k\u0303[[t1 , ..., t20]]) (resp. over k\u0303[[t1 , ..., t20]] constructed as the one of [De3, 2.1.7]\nhaving H as its underlying W (k)[[t1 , ..., t20]]-module but for p = 2). Warning: the Frobenius lift of W (k)[[t1 , ..., t20]] we work with takes ti into tpi , \u2200i \u2208 S(1, 20). We assume\nthe canonical lift of S is defined by the W (k)-epimorphism W (k)[[t1 , ..., t20]] \u0589 W (k)\nannihilating all ti 's. Forgetting the symmetric principally quasi-polarization, C and C1\nare objects of p \u2212 MF[0,2](W (k)[[t1 , ..., t20]]). Moreover, they are ordinary in the sense of\n[De3, 1.3.3]. So let U0 \u0592\u2192 U1 \u0592\u2192 C (resp. U10 \u0592\u2192 U11 \u0592\u2192 C) be the slope filtration in (filtered\nF -crystals) of C (resp. of C1 ) obtained as in [De3, 2.1.6] (see top of [De3, p. 109]). So\nU and U1 are uni plus versal objects of p \u2212 MF[0,1] (W (k)[[t1 , ..., t20]]) and so we can\napply [Fa2, th. 10] to them: we deduce the existence of a unique W (k)-isomorphism\nI : Spec(W (k)[[t1 , ..., t20]])\u2192Spec(W\n \u0303\n(k)[[t1 , ..., t20]]) which as a W (k)-isomorphism of\nW (k)[[t1 , ..., t20]] leaves invariant the ideal (t1 , ..., t20) and which is such that I \u2217 (U1 ) is\nisomorphic to U under an isomorphism ISO which mod (t1 , ...t20) is the natural identification. Referring to [De3, 2.1.7], the element c of it is uniquely determined by a,\nb1 ,..., b20 . So, as we are in a symmetric principally quasi-polarized context, there is a\nunique way to extend ISO to an isomorphism I \u2217 (C1 )\u2192C;\n \u0303\nmodulo (t1 , ..., t20) is as well\nthe natural identification.\nThe case of polarized ordinary K3 surfaces over k\u0303 of degree relatively prime to p\n(this excludes entirely the case p = 2) can be deduced as well from a) and b) (or from\n4.7.5 performed abstractly, i.e. in the context of Shimura-ordinary \u03c3k -crystals having the\nA-degree of definition equal to 1; see Theorem of 4) below) and from 2.2.21 UP, by a\nnatural process of moving (i.e. of lifting things) from the context of SO(2, 19)-groups to\nthe context of GSpin(2, 19)-groups. In other words, we can work entirely in the context\nof a Shimura filtered \u03c3k\u0303 -crystal (M\u0303 , F 1 (M\u0303 ), \u03c6\u0303, G\u0303, (t\u0303\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J \u0303 ), such that:\n\u2013 (M\u0303 , \u03c6\u0303) is ordinary and (M\u0303 , F 1 (M\u0303 ), \u03c6\u0303) is diagonalizable;\n\u2013 G\u0303ad is an absolutely simple, split W (k\u0303)-group of B10 Lie type;\n\u2013 G\u0303ab = Gm ;\n\u2013 the faithful representation G\u0303der \u0592\u2192 GL(M\u0303 ) is the spin representation of the simply\nconnected group cover of G\u0303ad (so dimW (k) (M\u0303 ) = 210 ).\nWe consider a direct summand M\u03031 of T (M ) normalized by G\u0303 and such that:\na) M\u03031 [ p1 ] is normalized by \u03c6\u0303;\n492\n\n\fb) the representation of G\u0303 on M\u03031 factors through G\u0303ad , giving birth to the symmetric\nfaithful representation of G\u0303ad of dimension 21;\nc) there is a symmetric perfect form \u03c8\u03031 on M\u03031 fixed by G\u0303ad and \u03c6\u0303 at the same time.\nThe existence of M\u03031 can be deduced easily by considering Zp -structures as in 2.2.9\n8) and applying arguments as in 2.3.9 B and E. The mentioned lifting process can be\nstated as (see \u00a77 and [Va12] for general forms of it):\n2B) Proposition (the lifting process in a K3 context). We assume k\u0303 is\njust perfect of odd characteristic. Let R be a local, henselian, regular, formally smooth\nW (k\u0303)-algebra having k\u0303 as its residue field and let \u03a6R be a Frobenius lift of R. Then any\n\u2207\nsymmetric p-divisible object (MR , (F i (MR ))i\u2208{0,1,2}, \u03a6MR , \u2207, pMR ) of MF[0,2]\n(R), with\n2\nF (MR ) of rank 1 and with MR of rank 21, is isomorphic to the symmetric p-divisible\n\u2207\nobject of MF[0,2]\n(R) obtained from a filtered F -crystal with tensors of the form\nClift = (M\u0303 \u2297W (k\u0303) R\u2227 , F 1 (M\u0303 ) \u2297W (k\u0303) R\u2227 , g\u0303R (\u03c6\u0303 \u2297 1), \u22070 , (t\u0303\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J \u0303 ),\nwith g\u0303R \u2208 G\u0303(R\u2227 ), by moving from M\u0303 to (M\u03031 (1), \u03c8\u03031 (1)) (in a way similar to the Fact 2\nof 2.2.10 but involving the Tate twist W (k\u0303)(1)).\nProof: We can assume \u03a6R is of additive type in the maximal point of Spec(R).\n\"Ignoring\" \u2207 and \u22070 , the existence of Clift is a consequence of the henselian assumption:\nany element of G\u0303ad (R\u2227 ) lifts to an element of G\u0303(R\u2227 ). The existence and uniqueness of\n\u22070 are implied by 3.6.18.4.4 1) and 3.6.18.8. But 3.6.18.8 also implies that under the\nprocess of moving from M\u0303 to M\u03031 (1), \u22070 \"becomes\" \u2207. This ends the proof.\n3) We look closer at [De3] to understand the real principles underlying the main\nresults of loc. cit. We see that there are precisely three main ideas. We formulate them\nin the language of this paper.\na) We have a Shimura \u03c3k -crystal which admits a \"canonical split\": with the notations\nof 2), this is a cocharacter \u03bc : Gm \u2192 G\u0303 with special properties; in particular, it produces\na direct sum decomposition M\u0303 = F\u0303 1 \u2295 F\u0303 0 , with \u03b2 \u2208 Gm (W (k)) acting through \u03bc on F\u0303 s\nas the multiplication with \u03b2 \u2212s , s = 0, 1 (to be compared with 3.1.4).\nb) The resulting Shimura filtered \u03c3k -crystal (M\u0303 , F\u0303 1 , \u03c6\u0303, G\u0303) is cyclic diagonalizable.\nc) We can construct good additive coordinates. By this we mean [De3, 1.4.2] (see also\n5) below).\n3') Using the cocharacter \u03bc, we get a natural Zp -structure of (M\u0303 , F\u0303 1 , \u03c6\u0303, G\u0303), as in\n4.4.7. So M\u0303 = MZp \u2297Zp W (k), with MZp a free Zp -module; under this identification, G\u0303 is\nobtained, by extension of scalars, from a reductive subgroup G\u0303Zp of GL(MZp ). Moreover\n\u03bc is defined over a finite unramified DVR extension W (k\u03bc ) of Zp ; we always choose the\nsmallest such extension. Let T be the smallest torus of G\u0303Zp such that \u03bc is obtained\nby pull back from a cocharacter of G\u0303W (k\u03bc ) factoring through TW (k\u03bc ) (cf. b) of 3) and\n2.2.16.1). Let k\u03bcad be the smallest subfield of k\u03bc such that the cocharacter of the image\n493\n\n\fof T in G\u0303ad naturally defined by \u03bc, is defined over W (k\u03bcad ). Let C be the centralizer of\nT in G\u0303Zp . It is a reductive group over Zp .\nThe principle behind the choice of W (k)-bases in [De3, 1.4.2] and in 4.7.5 is:\nWe pick up a maximal torus TC of C der ; only the C(Zp )-conjugacy class of TC matters.\nIf C der is split, then the most natural choice for TC is: a split maximal torus of C der .\nWhen C der is not split, still we have quite natural choices for TC . For instance,\nwe can take TC to contain a maximal split torus of C der and to split over the smallest\nunramified extension of Zp over which C der splits (cf. [Ti2, 1.10]); more concretely, we\ncan take TC as a maximal torus of a Borel subgroup of C der . For the most general\napplications it is important to take TC arbitrarily. Let TC1 be the maximal torus of G\u0303Zp\ngenerated by TC and by the maximal subtorus of Z(C); as in the proof of 3.11.1 we get\na Shimura filtered \u03c3k -crystal (M\u0303 , F\u0303 1 , \u03c6\u0303, TC1 ). We have\n\u03c6\u0303(Lie(TC1 ) \u2297Zp W (k)) = Lie(TC1 \u2297Zp W (k)).\nLet {t1 , ..., tdimW (k) (TC1 ) } be a W (k)-basis of Lie(TC1 ) \u2297Zp W (k) formed by elements fixed\nby \u03c6\u0303.\n4) It is easy to see that choosing a multiplicative type Frobenius lift of Rn , in 2)\nwe can not, for an arbitrary cyclic diagonalizable Shimura \u03c3k -crystal (M\u0303 , \u03c6\u0303, G\u0303), choose\ngRn to be the identity element of G\u0303(Rn ). Even for the case of the p-divisible group of a\nsupersingular elliptic curve over k (so m = n = 1) we can not choose gR1 = 1M\u0303 \u2297W (k) Rn .\nTo get out from this deadlock, in general we have to either use the additive situation (see\n5) below) or to work with the multiplicative situation, with a carefully chosen gRn (see\n6) below). In what follows we assume dd((M\u0303 , \u03c6\u0303, G\u0303)) > 0.\nBy G\u0303-canonical (multiplicative) coordinates for (M\u0303 , \u03c6\u0303, G\u0303) we mean that, referring to\na) and b) of 2), we can choose simultaneously the following five things:\ni) a lift F\u0303 1 of it of quasi CM type;\nii) n = dd((M\u0303 , \u03c6\u0303, G\u0303));\niii) a multiplicative type Frobenius lift of Rn (\u03a6Rn (zi + 1) = (zi + 1)p , \u2200i \u2208 S(1, n));\niv) gRn = 1M\u0303 \u2297W (k) Rn ;\nv) a connection which respects the G\u0303-action and of whose Kodaira\u2013Spencer map\nmodulo (In , p) is injective.\nIf the choices i) to v) are possible, we say (M\u0303 , \u03c6\u0303, G\u0303) has G\u0303-canonical (multiplicative)\ncoordinates. We have:\nTheorem. We consider a cyclic diagonalizable Shimura \u03c3k -crystal (M\u0303 , \u03c6\u0303, G\u0303). The\nfollowing three statements are equivalent:\na) it has G\u0303-canonical (multiplicative) coordinates;\nb) its attached Shimura adjoint Lie \u03c3k -crystal L is ordinary, with its multiplicity of\nthe slope \u22121 being maximal, i.e. equal to dd((M\u0303, \u03c6\u0303, G\u0303));\n494\n\n\fc) it is a G\u0303-ordinary \u03c3k -crystal and its A-degree of definition is 1.\nProof: If b) holds, then the cyclic adjoint factors of any G\u0303-ordinary \u03c3k -crystal C0\nproduced by (M\u0303 , \u03c6\u0303, G\u0303) are either trivial or are totally non-compact of constant type (cf.\n3.1.0 c) and 3.10.6). From this and 3.9.2 we get: (M\u0303 , \u03c6\u0303, G\u0303) is a G\u0303-ordinary \u03c3k -crystal.\nAs its attached Shimura adjoint Lie \u03c3k -crystal is ordinary, we get (cf. F2 of 3.10.7 and\nFact of 3.11.2 D): its A-degree of definition equal to 1. So b) implies c). Obviously c)\nimplies b) (to be compared with 4.6 P4).\nFrom the proof of 3.6.18.4 B) (see P6 of it) we get (cf. also 2)), that b) implies a).\nIn other words, choosing ii) to iv) to hold and choosing F\u0303 1 to be the G\u0303-canonical lift of\n(M\u0303 , \u03c6\u0303, G\u0303) (4.4.13.2 shows that in fact we have no other choice for F\u0303 1 ), based on 3.6.18.4\nP6 (see also 3.6.18.2), we get that we can assume that v) holds as well.\nWe assume now that a) holds. From 3.6.18.4 P5 we get that subject to the choices i)\nto iv), the image modulo (In , p) of the Kodaira\u2013Spencer map of any G\u0303-invariant connection, is a k-vector space of dimension at most equal to the multiplicity of the slope \u22121\nof the Shimura adjoint Lie \u03c3k -crystal attached to (M\u0303 , \u03c6\u0303, G\u0303). So from ii) and v) we get\nthat this multiplicity is equal to dd((M\u0303 , \u03c6\u0303, G\u0303)). But this implies that all cyclic adjoint\nfactors of C0 are either trivial or are totally non-compact of constant type. As above, we\nget that (M\u0303 , \u03c6\u0303, G\u0303) is a G\u0303-ordinary \u03c3k -crystal. From F2 of 3.10.7 we get that b) holds.\nThis proves the Theorem.\nIn particular, we reobtain in a much faster manner the results of 4.7.6-7.\n5) We come back to the general context of 3'). Let \u00d1 be the commutative, unipotent\nsubgroup of G\u0303 acting trivially on F\u0303 0 and on M\u0303 /F\u0303 0 . We take Rn to be the completion of\n\u00d1 in its origin (so n = dimW (k) (\u00d1 ) = dd((M\u0303 , \u03c6\u0303, G\u0303))). \u00d1 has a natural W (k\u03bcad )-structure;\nlet \u00d1W (k\u03bcad ) be the subgroup of G\u0303W (k\u03bcad ) which over W (k) is \u00d1 . If \u03a6Rn is of additive type,\nthen we speak about additive coordinates. Due to the condition on the Kodaira\u2013Spencer\nmap of b) of 2), we do not have too many choices in connection to additive coordinates:\n\u2207\nthe p-divisible object with tensors Cq of MF[0,1]\n(Rn ) is a Shimura filtered F -crystal of\n \u0303 (cf. 2.2.21 UP); so the only choice we have is in choosing\nthe form (M\u0303 , F\u0303 1 , \u03c6\u0303, G\u0303, \u00d1 , f)\n \u0303\n(the automorphism) f (of Rn ). The choice of f \u0303 corresponds to a choice of an additive\ntype Frobenius lift of Rn . [Fa2, rm. iii) after th. 10] tells us that it does not matter\nwhich choice we make. We propose one such choice, which to us looks convenient (at\nleast from the point of view of 8) below).\nThe maximal subtorus TC2 of TC1 contained in G\u0303der (resp. the image of T in G\u0303ad )\nmight not be split. It splits over an unramified finite DVR extension W (k2 ) (resp.\nW (k1 )) of Zp . As before, we choose the smallest such extension. We have natural\nZp -monomorphisms W (k\u03bcad ) \u0592\u2192 W (k1 ) \u0592\u2192 W (k2 ). Let \u00d10 be the smallest integral, closed\nsubgroup of G\u0303 such that it contains \u00d1 and its Lie algebra is taken by p\u03c6\u0303 into itself. We\nconsider two variants.\nVariant 1. Let Ga (i), i \u2208 S(1, n), be different Ga subgroups of \u00d1W (k1 ) , whose Lie\nalgebras are normalized by TW (k1 ) . Most common, they are not uniquely determined.\n495\n\n\fVariant 2. Let Ga (i), i \u2208 S(1, n), be the different Ga subgroups of \u00d1W (k2 ) , whose\nLie algebras are normalized by TC2 W (k2 ) . They are uniquely determined.\nUnder both these variants, we feel inclined of choosing \u03a6Rn such that it takes the\nsubring\nR(i) := W (k2 )[[zi ]]\nof Rn defined via (completion in the\nQ origin of) the projection (it is a group homomorphism) of \u00d1W (k2 ) on Ga (i) having j\u2208S(1,n)\\{i} Ga (j) as its kernel, into itself; it is also\nnatural to take\n\u03a6Rn (zi ) = zip ,\n\u2200i \u2208 S(1, n). Under both these variants, we can use TC (and so TC2 ) to determine uniquely\nzi 's, through different considerations but this (presently) looks irrelevant to us.\n6) We move now to the case when \u03a6Rn is of multiplicative type (i.e. it is as in iii)\nof 4)). We work under one of the two variants of 5). Two natural questions arise:\nQ What happens if the conditions of the Theorem of 4) are not satisfied? Is there a\nbest choice of gRn in such a case?\nWe propose here one good choice of gRn working out in all cases (i.e. in the case\nof the mentioned Theorem, provided we work under Variant 1, the element gRn to be\nintroduced below is the identity). We consider\nai \u2208 Lie(Ga (i))\ngenerating this Lie algebra. Warning: we always assume that the W (k)-subbasis\n{a1 , ..., an, t1 , ..., tdimW (k) (TC1 ) } of Lie(G\u0303) extends (by adding elements at the \"end\") to\na W (k)-basis {e1 , ..., edimW (k) (G\u0303) } of Lie(G\u0303) as in 2.2.12 c). Up to multiplying each ai by\nsome invertible element of W (k), this is automatic so under Variant 2; under Variant 1\nwe need to use the cyclic diagonalizability property in a way entirely similar to 3.4.3.0\n(1) (but without having good \"control\" on the exponents of p), in order to make suitable\nchoices so that this assumption is satisfied.\nFor i \u2208 S(1, n), let ni \u2208 N \u222a {\u221e} be the infimum of the set of numbers mi \u2208 N such\nthat \u03c6\u0303mi (ai ) \u2282 F 0 (Lie(G\u0303))[ p1 ]. Let\nS(1, n)0 := {i \u2208 S(1, n)|ni \u2208 N}.\nFor each i \u2208 S(1, n) \\ S(1, n)0 we consider an element bi \u2208 Lie(G\u0303) subject to the\nrequirements:\nR1 \u03c6\u0303(pbi ) = bi ;\nR2 the W (k)-span of bj 's is the same as the W (k)-span of aj 's, where j \u2208 S(1, n) \\\nS(1, n)0 .\n496\n\n\fLet gRn \u2208 \u00d1 (Rn ) be defined by the formula\ngRn = 1M\u0303 \u2297W (k) Rn +\n\nX\n\nai zi .\n\ni\u2208S(1,n)0\n\nWe have:\nTheorem. We can choose a connection on M\u0303 \u2297W (k) Rn respecting the G\u0303Rn -action,\nmaking\n(M\u0303 \u2297W (k) Rn , F\u0303 1 \u2297W (k) Rn , gRn (\u03c6\u0303 \u2297 1))\n\u2207\nto be viewed as a p-divisible object of MF[0,1]\n(Rn ) and whose Kodaira\u2013Spencer map is\nan injection (modulo (In , p)).\n\nProof: As (M\u0303 , F\u0303 1 , \u03c6\u0303) is cyclic diagonalizable we choose a W (k)-basis of M\u0303 as in\n2.2.1 d). Using it, we consider the convenient matrix form (as in 3.6.8.6 (CMF)) of the\nequations describing connections on M\u0303 \u2297W (k) Rn /pRn which respect the G\u0303Rn -action and\nmake (M\u0303 \u2297W (k) Rn /pRn , F\u0303 1 \u2297W (k) Rn /pRn , gRn (\u03c6\u0303 \u2297 1)) to be viewed as an object of\n\u2207\nMF[0,1]\n(Rn ). We view (cf. 3.6.8.6.1) this convenient matrix form as an equality between\ntwo elements of LIE/pLIE, where LIE := Lie(G\u0303) \u2297W (k) \u03a9\u0304Rn /W (k) .\nWe consider the Rn -basis {ei \u2297dzj |i \u2208 S(1, dimW (k) (G\u0303)), j \u2208 S(1, n)} of LIE. Due to\nthe cyclic diagonalizability assumption on {e1 , ..., edimW (k) (G\u0303) }, identifying the coefficients\nw.r.t. its reduction mod p of the mentioned two elements of LIE/pLIE and taken them\nmod (In , p), we come across systems of equations of first type very close in spirit to the\nones of (27) of 3.6.18.4 B). More precisely, if \u03c0 is the permutation of S(1, dimW (k) (G\u0303))\nobtained as in 2.2.12 c) (so \u03c6\u0303(ei ) = p\u03b5i e\u03c0(i) for some \u03b5i \u2208 S(\u22121, 1)), the equations (with\ncoefficients in k) are of the form\n(CY CLIC)\n\nd\u03c0(i)j + x\u03c0(i)j = bij xpij ,\n\ni \u2208 S(1, dimW (k) (G\u0303)), j \u2208 S(1, n). This is in conformity with 3.6.8.6 (CMF) and 3.6.8.6.2\n(so the right hand side of (CYCLIC) corresponds to the right hand side of 3.6.8.6 (CMF),\netc.). We have:\ni) bij = 0 iff i \u2208\n/ S(1, n) (cf. the definition of \u03c0(F 0 ) of 3.6.8.6 and the fact that \u03a6Rn\nis of multiplicative type);\n\u22121\nii) dij 6= 0 iff i = j \u2208 S(1, n)0 (cf. the shape of gRn and the definition of Cl EG\nin\n3.6.8.6).\n\nWe fix j0 \u2208 S(1, n)0 and i \u2208 S(1, dimW (k) (G\u0303)) and we look just at the equations\ninvolving xij0 , x\u03c0(i)j0 ,..., x\u03c0 ui \u22121 (i)j0 , with ui \u2208 N as the smallest number such that\n\u03c0 ui (i) = i. If i \u2208\n/ S(1, n) \\ S(1, n)0 and if j0 \u2208\n/ {i, \u03c0(i), ..., \u03c0 ui\u22121 (i)} then from i) and\nii) we get xij = 0. Warning: if i \u2208 S(1, n) \\ S(1, n)0 , then xij can be non-zero.\n497\n\n\fSo based on the previous paragraph and on ii), we easily get: \u2200i \u2208 S(1, n)0, the\nendomorphism \u0113i of My /pMy defined by evaluating any such connection at \u03b4z\u03b4 i and taking\neverything modulo (In , p), is of the following \"F 0 -truncated\" form\n(T RU N C)\n\nni\nX\ns=0\n\n\u0001\nbs (i)\u00e3s (i) +\n\nX\n\nci ai ,\n\ni\u2208S(1,n)\\S(1,n)0\n\nwhere bs (i) \u2208 k, with b0 (i) 6= 0, where ci \u2208 k (are not necessarily zero), and where \u00e3s (i)\nis the reduction mod p of ea(i,s) , with a(i, s) \u2208 S(1, dimW (k) (G\u0303)) uniquely determined\nby the property that \u03c6\u0303s (ai ) \u2208 B(k)ea(i,s) . We choose one such connection \u2207 + p with\nthe property that for any i \u2208 S(1, n) \\ S(1, n)0 , the similarly defined endomorphism \u0113i of\nMy /pMy is a non-zero multiple of bi /pbi (cf. R1 and the proof of 3.6.18.2).\nThe Kodaira\u2013Spencer map of \u2207p : its image modulo the ideal (z1 , ..., zn ) of Rn /pRn\ncontains the k-span of bi /pbi 's, i \u2208 S(1, n) \\ S(1, n)0, and by induction on the (increasing)\npossible values of ni 's, with i \u2208 S(1, n)0 , it contains (cf. (TRUNC)) ai /pai . So the\nTheorem follows (cf. a) and b) of 2)) from the standard way (see 3.6.18.7) of lifting \u2207p\nto a connection on M\u0303 \u2297W (k) Rn having all required properties.\nCorollary. Spf(Rn ) has a natural structure of a formal torus: it is defined by the\ncoordinates zi + 1, i \u2208 S(1, n).\nIn the case of the Theorem of 4), we have k1 = Fp and so \u00d10 = \u00d1 . So S(1, n)0 is\nthe empty set and we have\ngRn = 1M\u0303 \u2297W (k) Rn .\nMoreover, we can choose ai 's such that \u03c6\u0303(pai ) = ai , \u2200i \u2208 S(1, n). For such a choice\nof ai 's we can choose the connection \u2207 on M\u0303 \u2297W (k) Rn to have the following standard\nlogarithmic form\n(LN )\n\n\u2207=\u03b4+\n\nX\n\nai d(ln(zi + 1)).\n\ni\u2208S(1,n)\n\nHere \u03b4 is the connection on M\u0303 \u2297W (k) Rn that annihilates M\u0303 . Obviously such a connection\nhas all the properties mentioned in the Theorem. Accordingly, we view Theorem as the\ngeneralization of [Ka3, 3.7.1-3 and 4.3.1-2]: if G\u0303 = GL(M\u0303 ) and if (M\u0303 , F\u0303 1 , \u03c6\u0303) is the filtered\n\u03c3-crystal associated to the canonical lift of an ordinary p-divisible group over k having\nits dimension equal to half of its rank, then for a very particular choice of ai 's \u2013subject\nto the equalities \u03c6\u0303(pai ) = ai \u2013 we get exactly loc. cit.\nIn the general case it is still arguable which are the best choices for ai 's and zi 's. Of\ncourse the ai 's and zi 's are interrelated. We leave this problem of the best (i.e. the most\nnatural) such choices to get matured on its due time.\n7) The ideas of 3.6 (for instance see 3.6.1.3 and 3.6.8.1.2) suggest that W (k)-algebras\nof the form Rm and Rn are not always the right ones for getting crystalline coordinates.\n498\n\n\fOften they should be replaced by the p-adic completion of ind-\u00e9tale algebras over smooth\nW (k)-algebras. For instance. we can work with the p-adic completion of the henselization\nof the localization of W (k)[z1 , ..., zn] w.r.t. its maximal ideal (p, z1 , ..., zn) (cf. also 3.6.20\n5)). But these henselizations are still \"loosing\" a lot of information.\nVery often the W (k)-algebras we \"can get\", have \"plenty\" of k-valued points (i.e.\ntheir spectra are regular, AG k-schemes). For instance, working with Shimura \u03c3k crystals which are ordinary, using the Fact of 3.6.18.9 (and of 3.6.19), we can construct\ncanonical crystalline coordinates for W (k)-algebras whose spectra are the p-adic completion of N-pro-\u00e9tale covers of the p-adic completion of open, affine subschemes of\nSpec(W (k)[z1 , ..., zn]), like the one obtained by inverting all zi 's; so we have uni plus\nversal deformations of Shimura p-divisible groups over these spectra which are ordinary\n(in the usual way): they are defined or associated to \"prescribed\" (see 3.6.1.3 and 3.6.11)\nfiltered F -crystals with tensors.\nMore generally, referring to the Corollary of 6), instead of W (k)[[z1 , ..., zn]] we can\nwork with the p-adic completion of an N-pro-\u00e9tale cover of the spectrum of\nRnal := W (k)[z1 , ..., zn][ Q\n\n1\n\ni\u2208S(1,n) zi\n\n+1\n\n)],\n\ncf. Fact of 3.6.18.9 applied to\n\nal\n1\nal\nCal\n(\u03c6\u0303 \u2297 1)),\nq := (M\u0303 \u2297W (k) Rn , F\u0303 \u2297W (k) Rn , gRal\nn\n\nwith gRal\nhaving the same expression as gRn but being \"viewed\" as an element of G\u0303(Rnal ).\nn\nThis opens a completely new horizon: variation of crystalline coordinates in families.\nWhen we are in the context of a principally polarized abelian variety, we do not know\nfor which \"prescriptions\" we still get (principally) polarized abelian schemes over the\nspectra of these W (k)-algebras (in some variants we might have to deal with polarizations\nwhich are not necessarily principal). We recall: we do need a polarization in order to get\nabelian schemes over such spectra (cf. [FC, 1.10 a)]).\nWe do expect that the study of variations of crystalline coordinates will lead to nice\nmodular properties. We hope to come back to this idea in a future paper.\n8) In 3) to 6) we had some choices:\n\u2013 of \u03bc (and so of F\u0303 1 and of \u00d1 );\n\u2013 of TC ;\n\u2013 and of zi and ai , i \u2208 S(1, n).\nWe do not stop to see if we can make all these choices to result in something canonical\n(up to isomorphisms of (M\u0303 , \u03c6\u0303, G\u0303)). However, two samples are in order.\nU. If (M\u0303 , F\u0303 1 , \u03c6\u0303, G\u0303) is U -ordinary, then F\u0303 1 is uniquely determined and so \u03bc too.\nT. If in fact (M\u0303 , F\u0303 1 , \u03c6\u0303, G\u0303) is T -ordinary, then TC is as well uniquely determined.\nImplicitly, all ai and zi 's are uniquely determined up to multiplication with elements of\nGm (W (k2 )).\n499\n\n\fOne can go even further on (see [Va9]) in the T -ordinary case, to get a canonical\nchoice of ai 's and zi 's. Moreover, we have:\nCorollary. The G\u0303-canonical multiplicative coordinates of the Theorem of 4) (\"defined\"\nQn by zi + 1's of iii) of 4)) are canonical (up to isomorphisms of the form: zi + 1 goes\nto j=1 (zj + 1)nij , where nij \u2208 Zp are the entries of an invertible n \u00d7 n matrix).\n\nProof: This can be checked in the same manner as in the case of an ordinary\np-divisible group (i.e. of when we have G\u0303 = GL(M\u0303 )).\nFirst, the need to allow changes by isomorphisms is implied by the fact that in v)\nof 4), we did not specified which connection we choose: the set of such connections is\nin one-to-one correspondence to the set of invertible n \u00d7 n matrices with coefficients in\nZp (this can be deduced from 3.6.18.2 \u2013see equation (24) of it\u2013 by remarking that, due\nto iv) of 4), \u2013in our case\u2013 all bijl 's are 0; see also 3.6.18.7.0). Of course, we can always\nchoose the connection as in (LN) of 6). However, for the sake of flexibility we think it is\nimportant not to fix a priori a connection subject to v) of 4).\nSecond, there is a unique multiplicative type Frobenius lift of Rn for which gRn is\nthe identity element (here a fixed choice in v) of 4) is implicit). This is entirely the same\nas [Ka4, A2.2 (2)]: using the direct sum decomposition My = My1 \u2295 My2 of 1), we can\nadd extra variables (their number is n1y \u2212 n, where n1y is the number of slopes \u22121 of\n(End(My1 ), \u03c6y )) so that the situation gets reduced to loc. cit. (see Fact of 4.14.3 E below\nfor a more of a principle approach; the mentioned place is stated in terms of p = 2 but\na) of it holds for any prime). This ends the proof.\nThis Corollary motivates the terminology: G\u0303-canonical.\nComing back to the general case of 3), 6) gives us natural good structures of a formal\ntorus of the moduli formal scheme M(M\u0303 , \u03c6\u0303, G\u0303) of deformations of (M\u0303 , \u03c6\u0303, G\u0303) (see the proof\nof 3.12.1): we do not stop to see if there is a unique such group structure on M(M\u0303 , \u03c6\u0303, G\u0303)\n(the origin being fixed; it is defined by the F 1 -filtration F\u0303 1 of M\u0303 ). However, the part\nof the above Corollary and of its proof referring to isomorphisms and connections still\napplies to 6); we get that the coordinates of the Corollary of 6) are determined by the\nchoice of F\u0303 1 , ai 's and zi 's, i \u2208 S(1, n)0 , up to suitable isomorphisms of Rn which satisfy\nthe following 2 properties (see also 9) below for the second one):\nP1. zi is mapped into zi + z\u0303i , with z\u0303i \u2208 (zj )j\u2208S(1,n)\\S(1,n)0 , \u2200i \u2208 S(1, n)0;\nQ\nP2. zi + 1 is mapped into z\u0303i + j\u2208S(1,n)\\S(1,n)0 (zj + 1)mij , with z\u0303i \u2208 (zj )j\u2208S(1,n)0 ,\n\u2200i \u2208 S(1, n) \\ S(1, n)0; here mij \u2208 Zp are the entries of an invertible S(1, n) \\ S(1, n)0 \u00d7\nS(1, n) \\ S(1, n)0 matrix.\nDue to the fact that ci 's of the proof of 6) can be non-zero, we presently can not\nbe more precise (than P1-2) on the structure of the isomorphisms of Rn up to which the\ncoordinates of the Corollary of 6) are determined.\nWe assume now that there is a reductive subgroup G\u03030 of G\u0303 such that (M\u0303 , \u03c6\u0303, G\u03030 ) is\nalso a Shimura \u03c3k -crystal. It is not difficult to see (in connection to 6)) that by working\nunder Variant 1 of 5) we can make all choices to be functorial w.r.t. the monomorphism\n500\n\n\fG\u03030 \u0592\u2192 G\u0303, so that the moduli formal scheme of deformations of (M\u0303 , \u03c6\u0303, G\u03030 ) is a subtorus\nof the formal torus M(M\u0303 , \u03c6\u0303, G\u0303).\n9) We come back to the general case of 6). Let r be the Lie p-rank of (M\u0303 , \u03c6\u0303, G\u0303). We\nhave r \u2264 dd((M\u0303 , \u03c6\u0303, G\u0303)). If equality holds then we are in the situation of the Theorem\nof 4). We assume now that 1 \u2264 r < dd((M\u0303 , \u03c6\u0303, G\u0303)). In this case there is a uniquely\ndetermined quotient\nqn,r : Rn \u0589 Rr := W (k)[[x1 , ..., xr ]]\nsuch that (in the sense of 4)) we can take, for a suitable Frobenius lift \u03a6Rr of Rr , gRr to\nbe the identity. The uniqueness is P\nobtained immediately, by writing the connection on\nM\u0303 \u2297W (k) Rr in a logarithm form \u03b4+ i\u2208S(1,r) bi (r)d(ln(xi +1)), with bi (r) \u2208 Lie(G\u0303)\u2297W (k)\nRr ; as we are dealing with injective Kodaira\u2013Spencer maps and as gRr is the identity,\n\u03a6Rr has to be of essentially multiplicative type and so (cf. 3.6.18.1.1) we can assume\nthat it takes each xi + 1 into (xi + 1)p . We get immediately that all bi (r)'s belong to\nLie(G\u0303) and are fixed by p\u03c6\u0303. Based on the proof of 6), we conclude:\nKer(qn,r ) = (zi )i\u2208S(1,n)0 .\nCorollary. Regardless of the choices made, there is a canonical subtorus of\nM(M\u0303 , \u03c6\u0303, G\u0303) of dimension r.\n10) All of 1) to 9) can be entirely adapted (limitations do apply) to the case when\nk is just perfect. For instance, the part of b) of 2) involving liftings still makes sense if k\nis just dimW (k) (G\u0303)-simply connected (to be compared with 3.6.18.5.4 3)).\n4.7.12. Definition. We come back to the situation described in 4.7.5. The lifts of\ny (to DVR's which are finite extensions of W (k)) corresponding to torsion points of the\nformal torus of G-deformations of Ay , are called G-quasi-canonical lifts of y.\n4.7.13. Exercise. We assume 4.4.6 and we refer to 4.7.12. If k = F, prove that\nthe G-quasi-canonical lifts of a G-ordinary point y : Spec(k) \u2192 U are giving birth to\nspecial points of N (i.e. the abelian varieties obtained from A by pull back through these\nG-quasi-canonical lifts have complex multiplication). Show that they are the only lifts\nof y to DVR's of mixed characteristic, which are special points of N . Hint: if k(v) = Fp ,\nthis is well known; if k(v) 6= Fp then use 4.4.6, 4.7.11 1) and just imitate the standard\narguments of the case k(v) = Fp .\n4.7.14. Remark. We do not assume anymore N = N0 . From 4.7.11 3), 4) and\n6) (resp. from 4.7.11 5)) we deduce that for any toric point y1 : Spec(k) \u2192 Nk(v) there\nare good G-multiplicative (resp. G-additive) coordinates of the moduli formal scheme\nof G-deformations of (Ay1 , pAy1 ) := y1\u2217 (A, PA ). The same thing remains valid if we do\nnot work in a principally polarized context involving (as well de Rham components of)\nHodge cycles. Some particular situations are listed below.\na) For any point y1 : Spec(k) \u2192 Nk(v) whose attached Shimura adjoint Lie \u03c3k -crystal\nis isomorphic to the extension to k of the Shimura adjoint Lie \u03c3k -crystal of C\u03c9 of 4.1.5\n501\n\n\f(i.e. for any k-valued G(\u03c9)-ordinary point y1 of Nk(v) ), we get good G(\u03c9)-multiplicative\ncoordinates of the moduli formal scheme of G-deformations of (Ay1 , pAy1 ).\nb) For any point y : Spec(k) \u2192 U, we get good GSp-multiplicative coordinates\n(resp. good multiplicative coordinates) of the moduli formal scheme of deformations of\nthe principally polarized abelian variety (Ay , pAy ) (resp. of deformations of Ay ).\nc) For any supersingular elliptic curve Es over k we get a good additive coordinate t\nof its moduli formal scheme M1 of deformations. This reobtains [Og, 3.15]. Warning: in\nloc. cit., in order to keep track of principal quasi-polarizations, the \u03c3k -crystal (M1 , \u03c61 )\nof Es is described by a W (k)-basis {a, b} of M1 such that \u03c61 (a) = pb and \u03c61 (b) = \u2212a,\nand not by a W (k)-basis {a1 , b1 } such that \u03c61 (a1 ) = pb1 and \u03c61 (b1 ) = a1 ; as we can take\na1 = \u03b1a and b1 = \u03b1b, with \u03b1 \u2208 W (k) such that \u03c3k2 (\u03b1) = \u22121, the passage from {a, b} to\n{a1 , b1 } is automatic.\nThis suggests, that in the case of perfect fields, we can work as well with variants\nof the notion of cyclic diagonalizability: for instance, referring to 2.2.1 d), by allowing \u03c6(ei ) to be plus or minus p\u03b5i e\u03c0(i) we get the notion of almost cyclic (or circular)\ndiagonalizability.\n4.7.11 6) provides us as well with a good multiplicative coordinate t of M1 . It is worth\npointing out: in both additive and multiplicative cases, the Frobenius endomorphism of\nM1 \u2297 W (k)[[t]] takes a into pb and b into a + tb (of course the Frobenius of W (k)[[t]]\ndepends on which case we are).\nd) For any abelian variety over k which is a product of abelian varieties Ay1 as in a)\nor b), we get good multiplicative coordinates of its moduli formal scheme of deformations.\n4.7.14.1. Remark. More generally than d) we have the Corollary of 1.8. It is a\ndirect consequence of 2.2.18 and of 4.7.11 6).\n4.7.14.2. Remarks. Corollary of 1.8 is the most general abelian varieties context\nin which we presently can prove the existence of useful (crystalline) (additive or multiplicative) coordinates. From 2.2.19 we get that it does not handle the case of all abelian\nvarieties over k. In the cases left, the hopes of obtaining any theory of multiplicative\ncoordinates which has any significance at all (i.e. it is useful and motivated), are based\non 3.13. So the problem 13 from [Oo1, p. 13] is still open for the cases left. We leave\nit to the reader to formulate 4.7.14.1 in the relative context (of abelian varieties over k\nwhose attached \u03c3k -crystals have the extra structure of a cyclic diagonalizable Shimura\n\u03c3k -crystal) (cf. 4.7.11 5) and 6)).\n4.7.14.3. Study problem. In what follows we refer to 4.7.14 a). For any good\nG(\u03c9)-multiplicative coordinates, we can define G(\u03c9)-quasi-canonical lifts of y1 . It looks\nto us interesting to study them. In particular, if y1 is a G-ordinary point and N 6= N0 ,\n(as we had choices in 4.7.11) we do not know if (or when) these G-quasi-canonical lifts\nare uniquely determined or if (or when) the facts of 4.7.13 remain true.\n4.7.15. Exercise. Coming back to 4.7.3, prove that \u2200n \u2208 N, N \u2207\u0177 mod pn is\nalgebraic, i.e. the differential forms \u03b5j of 4.7.3.1, j = 1, e0 , are algebraic over NWn (k) .\n502\n\n\fHint: use 4.4.7 to reduce to the case k = k(v); then use the fact that everything, like the\nbases (ai )1\u2264i\u2264e and (bi )1\u2264i\u2264e , \u03bcy , etc., are definable over (the Witt ring of) a finite field\ncontaining k(v); another way: cf. 3.6.1.3.\n4.7.16. Problem. Obtain the general form of the main result of [No1] and of [No2]\nand show that all of [No2, section 2] remains valid in the context of G-ordinary points.\nHint: if N = N0 use 4.7.5-29, 4.7.13 and 4.7.17 below and just imitate the arguments of\n[No1-2]; if N 6= N0 then use 4.7.11 and work formally (i.e. abstractly).\n4.7.17. Formal subtori. Every formal subscheme of MG (y) of 4.7.8 which can\nbe \"defined\" starting from a smooth subgroup N1 of N whose Lie-algebra is taken by\np\u03c6y into itself is a formal subtorus. This can be checked using 4.7.5-29 or 4.7.11 8). The\nsame thing remains true in the general context of 4.7.11 4). Here, for the sake of future\nreference, we state this principle explicitly, just for the abstract context of Shimura \u03c3k crystals. We use the notations of 4.7.11 2) to 4) and assume that the equivalent statements\nof the Theorem of 4.7.11 4) hold. We have:\nTheorem. If there is a reductive subgroup G\u03031 of G\u0303 such that (M\u0303 , \u03c6\u0303, G\u03031 ) is also a\nShimura-ordinary \u03c3k -crystal, then the formal torus of dimension n1 := dd((M\u0303 , \u03c6\u0303, G\u03031 ))\nof deformations of (M\u0303 , F\u0303 1 , \u03c6\u0303, G\u03031 ) is canonically a formal subtorus of the formal torus of\ndeformations of (M\u0303 , F\u0303 1 , \u03c6\u0303, G\u0303).\nProof: We consider a family of tensors (t\u0303\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J \u03031 , with J1 a set containing J , such\nthat (M\u0303 , \u03c6\u0303, G\u03031 , (t\u0303\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J \u03031 ) is a Shimura \u03c3k -crystal with an emphasized family of tensors.\nWe first remark, that the F 1 -filtration of M\u0303 defining the G\u03031 -canonical lift of (M\u0303 , \u03c6\u0303, G\u03031 )\nis F\u0303 1 , cf. 4.4.13.2-3 and 3.11.1 a). Based on 2.2.21 UP, it is enough to show that there\nis a filtered F -crystal over the special fibre Spec(k[[z1 , ..., zn]]) of Spec(Rn ), with n as in\n4.7.11 4), such that:\n\u2207\n\u2013 it is a p-divisible object of MF[0,1]\n(Rn ) of the form (M\u0303 \u2297W (k) Rn , F\u0303 1 \u2297W (k) Rn , \u03c6\u0303\u2297\n \u0303 with the connection \u2207\n \u0303 on M\u0303 \u2297W (k) Rn as in v) of 4.7.11 4);\n1, \u2207),\n\n\u2013 the Frobenius lift of Rn takes zi + 1 to (zi + 1)p ;\n \u0303 modulo the ideal of Rn generated by zn +1 , ..., zn respects the G\u03031 -action (i.e. it\n\u2013\u2207\n1\nannihilates t\u0303\u03b1 , \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 J \u03031 ).\nThe construction of such a filtered F -crystal is trivial: Lie(\u00d1 ) has a W (k)-basis\nformed by elements fixed by p\u03c6\u0303 an such that a W (k)-subbasis of it is a W (k)-basis of\nLie(\u00d11 ), where \u00d11 := G\u03031 \u2229 \u00d1 ; so we just need to \"apply\" (LN) of 4.7.11 6) to it. This\nproves the Theorem.\n4.7.18. Problem. State a theorem similar to 4.7.5 in the general case, i.e. when\nk(v ) is not Fp . Hint: use 4.7.4 and 4.7.11 2) to 6).\nad\n\n4.8. The Galois property of G-ordinary points.\n4.8.1. Notations. We continue to assume k = k\u0304. We start with a morphism\nzV\ny : Spec(k) \u2192 U/H0 . Let Spec(V ) \u2192\nN /H0 be a lift of y, with V a DVR which is a\n503\n\n\ffinite, flat extension of W (k). Let K := V [ p1 ]. Let (AV , pAV ) := zV\u2217 (AH0 , PAH0 ) and let\n(AK , pAK ) be its generic fibre. Let\n\u0001\n1\n\u03c1 : Gal(K) \u2192 GL H\u00e9t\n(AK\u0304 , Qp ) (Qp )\n\u0001\n1\nbe the p-adic Galois representation associated to AK . Let GQp \u0592\u2192 GSp H\u00e9t\n(AK\u0304 , Qp ), pAK\nbe the subgroup fixing the p-components of the \u00e9tale components of the family of Hodge\ncycles (w\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J \u2032 with which AK\u0304 is naturally endowed.\n4.8.2. Theorem. There is a finite field extension K1 of K such that the restriction\n\u03c11 := \u03c1|Gal(K1 ) factors through the group of Qp -valued points of a connected solvable\nsubgroup of GQp .\nProof: We can assume K1 is big enough so that the family (w\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J \u2032 is defined over\nK1 . In fact, as we assumed k = k\u0304, for this part we can take K1 = K; argument: as V is\nstrictly henselian, AV has level-m structure, \u2200m \u2208 N, (m, p) = 1. So \u03c11 factors through\nGQp . We can assume G is not a torus.\nLet (My , Fy1 , \u03c6y , GW (k) ) be the Shimura filtered \u03c3k -crystal attached to the Gcanonical lift z : Spec(W (k)) \u2192 N /H0 of y. Let \u03bcy : Gm \u2192 GL(My ) be its canonical\nsplit. Let h\u0304i , i = 1, d, be the elements of Lie(GW (k) ) defined as in 4.1 but working with\n\u03bcy (cf. also 4.4.7).\nLet N1 be the smallest subgroup of GW (k) such that Lie(N1 ) contains Lie(N0 ) (N0\nwas def. in 4.7.1) and the Lie algebra generated by h\u0304i , i = 1, d. N1 is an integral, solvable\nsubgroup of GW (k) . Let BN1 be a Borel subgroup of GW (k) containing N1 and such that\nits Lie algebra is taken by p\u03c6y into itself. The solvability of N1 and the existence of such\nBorel subgroups is a consequence of 4.1.4.1 and of b) of 4.4.1 3). Let \u00d110 be the Zariski\nclosure in GW (k) of the connected component of the origin of the generic fibre of the\nintersection \u00d11 of all such Borel subgroups BN1 of GW (k) containing N1 . Lie(N1 ) and\nLie(\u00d110 ) are taken by p\u03c6y into themselves.\nWith the notations of 4.7.1 we get that Lie(N1 ) \u2297W (k) R and Lie(BN1 ) \u2297W (k) R are\ntaken by n(\u03c6y \u2297 1) into themselves. So for the morphism Spec(V1 ) \u2192 Spec(R) (with V1\nthe ring of integers of K1 ), defined naturally by zV , we get (cf. 4.7.2) that the Galois\nrepresentation \u03c11 leaves invariant Lie(N2 ), Lie(\u00d12 ) and Lie(BN2 ), with\nN2 \u2282 \u00d120 \u2282 BN2 \u2282 GQp\nsuch that BN2 is a Borel subgroup of GQp and N2 and \u00d120 are connected, solvable subgroups; here N2 , \u00d12 and BN2 are respectively the Qp -\u00e9tale correspondents (via Fontaine's\ncomparison theory; see [Fa2, th. 5]) of the crystalline ones N1 , \u00d110 and BN1 . In order\nto apply loc. cit. (mainly we need [Fa2, th. 7]), we just have to remark that the\nW (k)-homomorphism R \u2192 V1 lifts to a W (k)-homomorphism R \u2192 RV1 , where the\nW (k)-algebra RV1 is defined as in [Fa2, \u00a72] starting from an arbitrary uniformizer of V1 .\nBut as BN2 is its own normalizer in GQp , we get that \u03c11 factors through the group\nof Qp -valued points of BN2 . Repeating the argument for any Borel subgroup of GW (k) as\n504\n\n\fabove, we get that, by extending again K1 by a finite cover (as \u00d110 might be different from\n\u00d11 ), \u03c11 factors through the group of Qp -valued points of \u00d120 . This proves the Theorem.\n4.8.3. Remarks. a) 4.8.2 solves a question of C.-L. Chai. It was R. Pink who\npointed out the construction of N1 (of the proof), provided 4.7.2, c) of 4.4.1 2) and a)\nand b) of 4.4.1 3) were known. Always the unipotent radical of \u00d110 is the unipotent\nradical N0 of N1 . Argument: from 4.7.1 2) we get that N0 is the unipotent radical of\nthe parabolic subgroup P\u22640 of GW (k) whose Lie algebra is W0 (Lie(GW (k) ), \u03c6y ); so, as\n0\nthe integral, closed subgroup P=0\nof GW (k) whose generic fibre has W0 (Lie(GB(k) ), \u03c6y )\n0\nas its Lie algebra is reductive and has a natural Zp -structure P=0Z\n(see 3.11.2 C), we\np\njust have to remark that:\nZp ;\n\n0der\n\u2013 the intersection of all Borel subgroups of P=0Z\nis a finite, flat group scheme over\np\n\n\u2013 N1 is contained (cf. 3.11.2 C) in Z(P=0 )N0 .\nWarning: not always we have Lie(\u00d110 ) = Lie(N1 ) + Lie(Z 0 (GW (k) )), with Z 0 (GW (k) )\nas the maximal torus of Z(GW (k) ).\nb) Using [De4, 3.1 and 3.2 a)] and Fontaine's comparison theory (in a way similar to\nthe proof of the Fact of 2.2.9 1)), we get that we do not need to use \u00d110 as an intermediary:\n\u03c11 factors through N2 (Qp ), without having to replace K by K1 .\nc) There are plenty of examples in which \u00d110 is a Borel subgroup of GW (k) (for\ninstance if we are in the context of 4.6 P7; if moreover, Gad\nZp is a Zp -simple group then\nder\nder\nN1 \u2229GW (k) is a Borel subgroup GW (k) ) and plenty of examples when it is not (for instance,\nif Gad\nZp is a simple, split group of Cl Lie type, with l \u2265 2).\nd) A result similar to 4.8.2 can be proved for an arbitrary toric point Spec(k) \u2192\nNk(v) . Warning: in such a general context N1 is not necessarily a solvable group. So, if\nwe still want \u00d11 , then we have to define it using parabolic subgroups containing N1 .\nThere are many cases when the image of N1 in Gad\nW (k) is not contained in a Borel\nsubgroup of Gad\nW (k) ; for instance, this is the case if we are in a context modeled on\n4.4.13.3.1, with G\u03030 of the mentioned place of A1 Lie type: in such a case the image of\nad\nN1 in Gad\nW (k) is GW (k) itself.\ne) 4.8.2 and d) are properties of Shimura-ordinary \u03c3k -crystals (instead of 4.7.2 we\nhave to use 2.2.21). Moreover the condition k = k\u0304 can be weaken: we just need the\nexistence of a Borel subgroup BN1 of GW (k) of the type mentioned above; warning: in\nsuch a situation we can not (in general) replace \u00d12 by N2 .\nWe assume now that k is a finite field, that we are in the context of 4.8.1 and that\n4.4.6 holds. We have:\nTheorem. Up to a passage to a finite field extension of k, the existence of such a\nBorel subgroup BN1 is automatic.\nProof: We use the previous notations. Based on 4.4.6, by passage from k to a finite\nfield extension of it, we can assume that the generic fibre of P\u22640 has a maximal torus\n505\n\n\fwhose Lie algebra is generated by elements fixed by \u03c6y . Let N3 be the connected subgroup\nof GB(k) generated by this maximal torus and by the generic fibre of the unipotent radical\n\u00e9t\n\u00e9t\nP<0 of P\u22640 . Let P<0\n\u2282 N4 \u2282 P\u22640\n\u2282 GQp be the subgroups corresponding to P<0 , N3\nand respectively P\u22640 via Fontaine's comparison theory (applied to zV ). So the algebraic\n\u00e9t\n\u00e9t\n\u00e9t\nenvelope ALE of \u03c1 is a subgroup of P\u22640\nsuch that its image in P\u22640\n/P<0\nbelongs to the\nimage of N4 in it. So ALE is a subgroup of N4 . This ends the proof.\nUsing this Theorem, we obtain (for instance, cf. 4.4.5 and 4.6.3 B) plenty of quasiordinary crystalline representations in the sense of [Pi, 2.10].\nf ) We stated this section 4.8 in terms of Qp -valued points; but everything can be\nrestated in terms of Zp -valued points.\n4.9. The passage from Shimura varieties of Hodge type to Shimura varieties of preabelian type. Very often (like in the study of K3 surfaces, of cubic\nfourfolds, etc.), we have to consider integral aspects of Shimura varieties of preabelian\ntype which are not of Hodge type. So here we extend a great part of 4.1-8 to the (often\nabstract) context of integral canonical models of Shimura quadruples of preabelian type;\non the way we show that many properties pertaining to a SHS (f, L(p) , v) are canonical,\ni.e. are properties just of N itself, not depending on who or how f is.\n4.9.1. The initial setting. We start with an arbitrary Shimura variety Sh(G0 , X0 )\nof adjoint, abelian type. Let (G0 , X0 , H0 , v0 ) be a Shimura quadruple with v0 dividing\na rational prime p \u2265 3. We fix a connected component X00 of X0 (it does not matter\nwhich one, cf. [Va2, 3.3.3]). Let (Gi , Xi , Hi , vi ), i = 1, 3, be Shimura quadruples having\n(G0 , X0 , H0 , v0 ) as their adjoint quadruples and such that X00 \u2282 Xi (cf. [Va2, 2.4]).\nWe assume the existence of two standard Hodge situations (fi , Li (p) , vi ) defined by fi :\n\u0001\n(Gi , Xi ) \u0592\u2192 GSp(Wi , \u03c8i ), Si , i = 1, 2, such that Hi = Gi (Li (p) \u2297Z(p) Zp ) (for p \u2265 5 cf.\n[Va2, 6.4.2]; for p = 3 cf. \u00a76]). For them we use the standard notations of 2.3.1-3, except\nthat we put a right lower index i everywhere, i = 1, 2.\nWe denote by N0 and N3 the integral canonical models of (G0 , X0 , H0 , v0 ) and respectively of (G3 , X3 , H3 , v3 ) (cf. [Va2, 6.4.1] for p \u2265 5; for p = 3 see \u00a76). We get natural\nji\n\nO(v0 ) -morphisms Ni \u2192 N0 (cf. [Va2, 3.2.7 4)]), i = 1, 3.\n4.9.1.1. The definition of Ci 's. Let V0 := W (F) and let\nC0 := \u2229i3 \u2208F M j3 (N3 V0 ),\nwhere F M is the set of all finite maps i3 : (G3 , X3 , H3 , v3 ) \u2192 (G0 , X0 , H0 , v0 ) such that\nX00 \u2282 X3 . The fact that C0 is non-empty is implied by the fact that C0 \u00d7V0 j C is nonempty (with j : V0 \u0592\u2192 C an arbitrary O(v0 ) -monomorphism). The fact that C0 is an\nopen closed subscheme of N0V0 is implied for p \u2265 5 by [Va2, 6.4.5.1] (for p = 3 cf. \u00a76).\nSimilarly, working with the connected component X00 of Xi , we define an open closed\nembedding Ci \u0592\u2192 Ni V0 , i = 1, 3.\n506\n\n\f4.9.2. The new SHS. Let (G4 , X4 , H4 , v4 ) be a Shimura quadruple which together\nwith maps hi : (G4 , X4 , H4 , v4 ) \u2192 (Gi , Xi, Hi , vi ), i = 1, 2, is a quasi fibre product of the\nbelow finite maps q1 and q2 , i.e. we have a commutative diagram\n(G4 , X4 , H4 , v4 )\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6h\ny 2\n\n(G2 , X2 , H2 , v2 )\n\nh\n\n1\n\u2212\u2192\n\nq2\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\n(G1 , X1 , H1 , v1 )\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6q1\ny\n\n\u0001\n(G0 , X0 , H0 , v) \u00d7 Gm , {x0 }, Gm (Zp ), p\n\nin the category qf \u2212 Sh defined in [Va2, 3.2.7 3)], with G4 as the connected component\nof the origin of G2 \u00d7G0 \u00d7Gm G1 ; this diagram satisfies a quasi universal property as in\n[Va2, 2.4.0]. Here qi is defined by the adjoint map (Gi , Xi , Hi , vi ) \u2192 (G0 , X0 , H0 , v0 )\nand via the canonical map hi : (Gi , Xi ) \u2192 (GSpab , S ab ) defined via fi , i = 1, 2, where\n{x0 } := S ab and GSpab = Gm . We assume X00 \u2282 X4 , cf. loc. cit. and [Va2, 3.2.7 3)].\nWe call (G4 , X4 ) as a Hodge twist of (G1 , X1 ) and (G2 , X2 ) and denote it by\n \u0303 2 , X2 ).\n(G1 , X1 )\u00d7(G\nWe consider a Hodge quasi product (G1 \u00d7H G2 , X1 \u00d7H X2 ) of (G1 , X1 ) and (G2 , X2 ),\nand a Hodge quasi product (GSp(W1 , \u03c81 )\u00d7H GSp(W2 , \u03c82 ), S1 \u00d7H S2 ) of (GSp(W1 , \u03c81 ), S1 )\nand (GSp(W2 , \u03c82 ), S2 ), cf. [Va2, Example 3 of 2.5]. We use similar notations for quadruples. We can assume that\nX4 \u2282 X1 \u00d7H X2 \u2282 S1 \u00d7H S2 .\nSo we get (see 4.9.2.0 below) a new SHS\n(f4 , L1 (p) \u2295 L2 (p) , v4 )\ndefined by the composite injective map f4\n\u0001 i\n\u01294\n(G4 , X4 ) \u0592\u2192 GSp(W1 , \u03c81 ) \u00d7H GSp(W2 , \u03c82 ), S1 \u00d7H S2 \u0592\u2192 (GSp(W1 \u2295 W2 , \u03c81 \u2295 \u03c82 ), S),\n\nwhere \u01294 := (f1 \u00d7H f2 ) \u25e6 i4 , with\n\ni4 : (G4 , X4 ) \u0592\u2192 (G1 \u00d7H G2 , X1 \u00d7H X2 )\nand with\nf1 \u00d7H f2 : (G1 \u00d7H G2 , X1 \u00d7H X2 ) \u0592\u2192 (GSp(W1 , \u03c81 ) \u00d7H GSp(W2 , \u03c82 ), S1 \u00d7H S2 )\nas the natural inclusions, and where i is a Segre embedding, as used in loc. cit.\nLet N4 be the integral canonical model of (G4 , X4 , H4 , v4 ) and let C4 be the open\nclosed subscheme of N4 V0 defined similarly to C0 . We have a natural O(v0 ) -morphism\nN4 \u2192 N1 \u00d7 N2 . It is defined via the composite of i4 with the natural injective map\n(G1 \u00d7H G2 , X1 \u00d7H X2 ) \u0592\u2192 (G1 \u00d7 G2 , X1 \u00d7 X2 ),\n507\n\n\fcf. [Va2, 3.2.16 and 3.2.7 4)]. So we speak about points of N4 mapping into points of Ni ,\ni \u2208 {1, 2}.\n4.9.2.0. The argument. The fact that the triple (f4 , L1 (p) \u2295 L2 (p) , v4 ) is indeed a\nSHS, is related to the proof of Milne's conjecture (see 1.15.1, d) of 4.4.1 3) and 4.4.12).\nLet M4 be the integral canonical model of the Shimura quadruple associated naturally\nto the SHS (1(GSp(W1 \u2295W2 ),\u03c81 \u2295\u03c82 ),S) , L1 (p) \u2295 L2 (p) , p). From constructions we have\nH4 = G4 (Qp ) \u2229 GSp(L1(p) \u2295 L2(p) , \u03c8)((L1(p) \u2295 L2(p) ) \u2297Z(p) Zp ).\nSo, from [Va2, 3.2.7 4)] we get a natural morphism\nm\u0303 : N4 \u2192 M4 .\nWe need to show that for any morphism z : Spec(W (k)) \u2192 N4 , working with m\u0303, the\ncondition (\u2217) of 2.3.4 is satisfied. The idea behind checking this is rooted in [BLR, th. 1\nof p. 109] and the density part of 4.2.1. To explain it, we index the main paragraphs by\ncapital letters.\nA. [Va2, 3.3.2] allows us to assume z factors through C4 . Moreover, 2.3.12-13 makes\nsense even without knowing that we are in a reductive context: using canonical splits\nof filtered \u03c3k -crystals endowed with tensors, we can perform [Va2, 5.4-5] directly in the\ncontext of abelian unipotent groups. This goes as follows. Let (M, F 1 , \u03c64 , (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J4\u2032 ) be\nthe p-divisible object with tensors of MF[0,1] (W (k)) naturally associated to z and m\u0303 (to\nbe compared with 2.3.4; of course some choices \u2013like of a family of tensors (v\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J4\u2032 of\nT ((W1 \u2297Q W2 )\u2217 ) such that G4 is the subgroup of GL(W1 \u2297Q W2 ) fixing them, like of a\nZ-lattice of W1 \u2297Q W2 , etc.\u2013 are in order: they can be made as in 2.3.1-2).\nWe consider the reductive subgroup G\u03034B(k) of GL(M [ p1 ]) fixing t\u03b1 , \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 J4\u2032 . Let\nG\u03034W (k) be its Zariski closure in GL(M ). Using the canonical split cocharacter of\n(M, F 1 , \u03c64 ) (see also 2.2.1.2), as in 4.7.1 we define a subgroup N of G\u03034W (k) . N is always\na smooth group over W (k), identifiable with the affine group scheme defined by Lie(N ),\neven if by chance G\u03034W (k) is not a reductive subgroup of GL(M ). So, 2.2.10 can still be\n \u0303 (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J \u2032 ), and so we can\nperformed in the context of the 7-tuple (M, F 1 , \u03c64 , G\u0303W (k) , N, f,\n4\nstill perform 2.3.12-13 in this context (even if the maximal integral subgroup of G\u0303W (k)\nnormalizing F 1 is not smooth). The last thing we need to add: we have a variant of the\nTheorem of 2.3.11 in the context of (M, F 1 , \u03c64 , G\u0303W (k) , N, f \u0303, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J4\u2032 ), as the result [Va2,\n4.1.5] (used in [Va2, 5.4.5]) involves arguments purely in characteristic 0.\nB. Coming back to our concrete situation, from the above paragraph and the density\npart of 4.2.1, we deduce that it is enough to check condition (\u2217) of 2.3.4 for z lifting a\nG4 -ordinary point of C4k(v4 ) . The set of such points is the same, regardless of which\nmorphism N4 \u2192 N1 or N4 \u2192 N2 we use to define them \u2013by being mapped into a\nGi -ordinary point of Nik(vi ) , i \u2208 {1, 2}\u2013: the arguments of 4.9.3 below, at the level\nof isocrystals, apply, as the fact that a Shimura F -crystal over a perfect field is or is\n508\n\n\fnot Shimura-ordinary can be \"read out\" (cf. 3.1.0 c)) from the Newton polygon of\nits attached Shimura adjoint Lie isocrystal. 4.9.2.1 to 4.9.3 below are stated in terms of\nShimura adjoint Lie \u03c3\u0304-crystals, starting from the fact that the triple (f4 , L1 (p) \u2295L2 (p) , v4 )\nis a SHS; however, without assuming this, it can be performed independently but in the\ncontext of adjoint Lie isocrystals over k. Of course, if we desire to simplify the things, we\ncan define such G4 -ordinary points of N4k(v4 ) , as points mapping into Gi -ordinary points\nof Nik(vi ) , \u2200i \u2208 {1, 2} (sort of intersection of subschemes of G4k(v4 ) : [Va2, 6.4.5.1] and\n4.2.1 guarantee that this intersection is still an open, dense subscheme of N4k(v4 ) ).\nMoreover, we can assume z maps into a Gi -canonical lift of Ni , \u2200i \u2208 {1, 2} (again cf.\n4.9.3 below, performed with filtered isocrystals over k; b) of 4.4.1 2) implies: Shimuracanonical lifts can be \"read out\" from attached Shimura adjoint filtered Lie isocrystals).\nThis implies that the Galois representation defined by z (working with m\u0303) factors through\nthe Zp -valued points of a torus of GZp (see also 4.5.11.2.1). This is the context in which we\ncan prove directly Milne's conjecture referred to in 1.15 (for details see \u00a75). So condition\n(\u2217) of 2.3.4 is satisfied for z.\nC. To avoid referring to \u00a75, we now present an alternative (independent) proof of why\n(\u2217) of 2.3.4 is satisfied for z. We consider the Shimura filtered Lie isocrystal (definable\nas in 2.3.10)\n1\n1\n1\n(LI4 [ ], \u03c64 , F 0 (LI4 [ ]), F 1 (LI4 [ ]))\np\np\np\nassociated to z (via m\u0303); here LI4 := Lie(G\u03034B(k) ). It is identifiable with a filtered Lie\nsubisocrystal of the direct sum\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1 \u0001\nLI1 [ ], \u03c61 , F 0 (LI1 [ ]), F 1 (LI1 [ ])) \u2295 (LI2 [ ], \u03c62 , F 0 (LI2 [ ]), F 1 (LI2 [ ]) ,\np\np\np\np\np\np\nwhere (LIi , \u03c6i , F 0 (LIi ), F 1 (LIi )), with LIi := Lie(GiW (k) ), is the Shimura filtered Lie\n\u03c3k -crystal associated to the morphism Spec(W\u0002(k)) \u2192 Ni defined\n\u0003\n\u0001by z (via fi ), i \u2208 {1, 2}.\n1\n1\nUnder this identification, using projections, LI4 [ p ], LI4 [ p ] , \u03c64 can be identified with\n\u0002\n\u0003 \u0001\nLIi [ p1 ], LIi[ p1 ] , \u03c6i , i = 1, 2. We just need to show that\n1\nLI4 := LI[ ] \u2229 (LI1 \u2295 LI2 )\np\nis the Lie algebra of a reductive subgroup (it is G\u03034W (k) ) of G1W (k) \u00d7 G2W (k) \u2282 GL(M ).\n[Va2, 4.3.13] takes care of the maximal torus of Z(G\u03034W (k) ), while [Va2, 3.1.6] allows us\nto concentrate just on the \"der\" part of G\u03034W (k) , and so on the \"adjoint\" part of G\u03034W (k) .\nBut for the adjoint context, as Gad\niZ(p) does not depend on i \u2208 {1, 2, 4}, we can appeal to\n4.2.3-5. So, the Galois representation\nad\n\u0393k \u2192 Gad\n4Zp (Zp ) \u0592\u2192 Aut(Lie(G4Zp ))(Zp )\n\n509\n\n\fdefined naturally by the W (k)-valued point of M1 \u00d7 M2 obtained naturally from z (we\nrecall that, cf. 2.3.7, Mi is the extension to O(vi ) of the integral canonical model of the\nSHS (1(GSp(Wi ,\u03c8i ),Si ) , Li (p) , p)), defines, (by inverting p and) via Fontaine's comparison\ntheory, a Shimura adjoint Lie isocrystal\n1\n(LIE, \u03c6\u0303) := (Lie(Gad\n4B(k) ), \u03c64 ) \u2282 (LI4 [ ], \u03c64 )\np\nover k. Moreover, using 2.3.10 for the W (k)-valued point of Ni defined by z (via fi ), we\ndeduce (via the above identifications) the existence of a W (k)-lattice LIEiW of LIE, such\nthat the quadruple (LIEiW , \u03c6\u0303, F 0 (LIEiW ), F 1 (LIEiW )) is (naturally identifiable with) the\nShimura adjoint filtered Lie \u03c3k -crystal attached to (LIi , \u03c6i , F 0 (Lii ), F 1 (LIi )), i = 1, 2.\ni\ni\nHere F j (LIEW\n) := LIEW\n\u2229 F j (LIi [ p1 ]), j \u2208 {0, 1} and i \u2208 {1, 2}. We have:\nD. Claim. LIE1W = LIE2W .\nProof: Let B + (W (k)) and \u03b20 have the same significance as in [Fa2, \u00a74]: the notations to be used are as in 2.3.18.1 E (but this time B + (W ((k)) is defined by completing\nusing the P D-topology). We have (cf. the logical passage in [Fa2, th. 7 of \u00a76] to\nEnd's) regardless of what odd prime p we are dealing with, the following B + (W (k))monomorphisms:\n(2)\ni\n\u22121 +\n+\nLIEiW \u2297W (k) \u03b20 B + (W (k)) \u0592\u2192 Lie(Gad\n4Zp ) \u2297Zp B (W (k)) \u0592\u2192 LIEW \u2297W (k) \u03b20 B (W (k)).\nStrictly speaking, the mentioned passage gives us such an inclusion at the level of Lie\nalgebras of derived groups and not of adjoint groups: it is 3.1.8.1 (TOR) which allows\nus to move from the derived context to the adjoint context (if TG is a maximal torus of\na semisimple group G\u0303 over W (k), then Lie(G\u0303), as a W (k)-module, is the direct sum of\nLie(TG ) and of a W (k)-submodule of Lie(G\u0303) which depends only on Gad , cf. the existence\nof Weyl's decompositions).\nSo for p \u2265 5, the Claim is a consequence of [Fa2, th. 7 of \u00a76]. To see that it is also\ntrue for p = 3 we rely on loc. cit., on 2.3.18.1 E and on 3.11.8.1. So, based on 3.11.8.1,\nwe start with the \u00e9tale slope type direct sum decomposition\nad\nad\nLie(Gad\n1Zp ) = Lie(G2Zp ) = Lie(G4Zp ) = \u2295\u03b1\u2208SSL L\u03b1 ,\n\nwhere SSL is the set of slopes of (LIE, \u03c6\u0303), and with the slope type direct sum decompositions\ni\ni\ni\n(LIEW\n, F 0 (LIEW\n), F 1 (LIEW\n), \u03c6\u0303) = \u2295\u03b1\u2208SSL Ci\u03b1 ,\ni \u2208 {1, 2}. From the adjoint form of 3.11.8.1 (ZERO) we get that L0 \u2297Zp W (F) can be\ni\nnaturally identified with W (0)(LIEW\n, \u03c6\u0303), i \u2208 {1, 2}. So we have C10 = C20 . Similarly,\nas (2) is obtained from a similar B + (W (k))-monomorphism associated to a p-divisible\ngroup over W (k), by passage to the adjoint context, if {\u22121, 1} \u2282 SSL we get that \u03b20 L1\ni\n(resp. \u03b20\u22121 L\u22121 ) is naturally identifiable with the Lie subalgebra of LIEW\ncorresponding\ni\n1\n2\n1\n2\nto slope 1 (resp. \u22121) of (LIEW , \u03c6\u0303), i \u2208 {1, 2}. So C1 = C1 and C\u22121 = C\u22121 .\n510\n\n\fWe recall from [Fa2, \u00a74] that \u03b202 has an image in gr 1 := F 1 (B + (V ))/F 2 (B + (W (k)))\n\u2227\nwhich is 3 times a generator of this free W (k) -module of rank 1. So using entirely\nthe same arguments as in 2.3.18.1 E, from (2) we get that Ci\u03b1 is determined by the \u0393k module L\u03b1 , i \u2208 {1, 2}, \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1) \u222a (\u22121, 0). We conclude C1\u03b1 = C2\u03b1 , \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 SSL, and so\n1\n2\nLIEW\n= LIEW\n. This proves the Claim.\nE. GiW (k) is the connected component of the origin of the group of Lie automori\nphisms of LIEW\n, i \u2208 {1, 2} (cf. end of 2.2.13). From this and the Claim we get that\nad\nad\nad\nthe Zariski closure in Gad\n1W (k) \u00d7 G2W (k) of the subgroup of G1B(k) \u00d7 G2B(k) whose Lie\nad\nad\nalgebra is LIE, is an adjoint group G\u0303ad\n4W (k) ; its projections on G1W (k) and on G2W (k) are\nisomorphisms (for instance, cf. [Va2, 3.1.2.1 c)]). This takes care of the adjoint part of\nG\u0303W (k) . The passage from adjoint groups to derived groups is trivial: as the normalizader\ntion of G\u0303ad\n4W (k) in the field of fractions of G\u03034B(k) is a semisimple group, we get a natural\nder\nhomomorphism from it into Gder\n1W (k) \u00d7 G2W (k) , and again loc. cit. implies that it is a\n\nclosed embedding. We conclude (based on [Va2, 3.1.6]): G\u0303W (k) is a reductive group. This\nends the argument of why (f4 , L1 (p) \u2295 L2 (p) , v4 ) is a SHS.\n4.9.2.1. Pro-\u00e9tale covers. For the SHS (f4 , L1 (p) \u2295 L2 (p) , v4 ) we use the standard\nnotations of 2.3.1-3, except that we put a right lower index 4 everywhere. We (naturally)\nget a commutative diagram of pro-\u00e9tale covers:\nm\n\n2\nC4 \u2212\u2192\nC1\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6n\n\uf8e6m\ny 1\ny 1\n\nC2\n\nn\n\n2\n\u2212\u2192\nC0\n\n(cf. the definition of Ci , i \u2208 {0, 1, 2, 4}, and [Va2, 3.2.7 4) and 6.4.5.1]).\n4.9.3. Points. Let z0 \u2208 C0 (V0 ). Let zi \u2208 Ci (V0 ) be such that ni \u25e6 zi = z0 , i = 1, 2.\nLet z4 \u2208 C4 (V0 ) be such that m1 \u25e6 z4 = z2 and let z3 := m2 \u25e6 z4 . We denote by yi \u2208 Csi (F)\nthe F-valued point defined by zi \u2208 Csi (V0 ), with i = 0, 4, with si = i if i 6= 3 and with\ns3 = 1. Let Cad\nyi be the Shimura adjoint Lie \u03c3\u0304-crystal attached to yi , i = 1, 4, obtained\nusing the SHS (fsi , Lsi (p) , vsi ), with L4 (p) := L1 (p) \u2295 L2 (p) . From the construction of f4 ,\nad\nad\nwe deduce the existence of a monomorphism Cad\ny4 \u0592\u2192 Cy3 \u2295 Cy2 between Shimura adjoint\nLie \u03c3\u0304-crystals, which produces (via its composite with the natural projections on the\nad\nad\nad\nad\nfactors of Cad\ny3 \u2295 Cy2 ; see 4.9.2.0 E) isomorphisms of Cy4 with Cy2 and with Cy3 .\n4.9.4. Lemma. Cad\nyi , i = 1, 4, are all isomorphic.\nad\nad\nad\nProof: We have just seen that Cad\ny4 is isomorphic to Cy2 and Cy3 . The fact that Cy1\nand Cad\ny3 are isomorphic results from the fact that z1 and z3 are two lifts to C1 of z0 and\nso z3 = ia (z1 )h, with h \u2208 G1 (Apf ) and with\n\u223c\n\na : (G1 , X1 , H1 , v1 ) \u2192 (G1 , X1 , H1 , v1 )\n511\n\n\fan automorphism defined by an element of G0 (Z(p) ) := G0 (Q) \u2229 H0 (cf. [Va2, 3.3.1]);\nhere as well as below we denote by ia the automorphism of N1 naturally defined by a (cf.\n[Va2, 3.2.7 4)]). But the Shimura adjoint Lie \u03c3\u0304-crystal attached to y1 is isomorphic to\nthe one attached to ia (y1 ) (the argument of this is entirely analogous to the ones which\nad\nad\nproduced isomorphisms of Cad\ny4 with Cy2 and with Cy3 : we need to \"put together\" the SHS\n(f1 , L1 (p) , v1 ) and the SHS (f1 \u25e6 a1 , L1 (p) , v1 ), where we denote by a1 the isomorphism\n(G1 , X1 )\u2192(G\n \u0303 1 , X1 ) defined by a), and so (see Fact 6 of 2.3.11) it is isomorphic to the\none attached to y3 = ia (y1 )h.\n4.9.5. Terminology. We refer to Cad\ny1 as the Shimura adjoint Lie \u03c3\u0304-crystal attached\nto y0 . The above Lemma guarantees that it is well defined. For any algebraically closed\nfield k of characteristic p and for every y01 \u2208 C0 (k), we define similarly the Shimura\nadjoint Lie \u03c3k -crystal attached to y01 .\n4.9.5.1. Remark. In all above operations, we can keep track of inner isomorphism classes as in 4.2.10: so in 4.9.4 (as well as in 4.9.7 below) we can speak replace\n\"isomorphic\" by inner isomorphic.\n4.9.6. Translations. If now z00 \u2208 N0 (V0 ) is the translation of z0 by an element\nt0 \u2208 G0 (Apf ) and we work with (the assumed to exist) z10 , z20 , z30 , z40 , and y10 , y20 , y30 , y40\nhaving a similar meaning, we get similarly that z30 = ia0 (z10 )h0 , with h0 \u2208 G1 (Apf ) and\n\u223c\nwith a0 : (G1 , X1 , H1 , v1 ) \u2192 (G1 , X1 , H1 , v1 ) an automorphism defined by an element of\nG0 (Z(p) ). We have:\ny40\n\n4.9.7. Proposition. The Shimura adjoint Lie \u03c3\u0304-crystals attached to y10 , y20 , y30 and\nare all isomorphic to Cad\ny1 .\n\nProof: The argument that the Shimura adjoint Lie \u03c3\u0304-crystals attached to y10 , y20 ,\nand y40 are isomorphic to each other is as in 4.9.4. The fact that the Shimura adjoint\nLie \u03c3\u0304-crystal attached to y10 is isomorphic to Cad\ny1 can be checked, without any reference\n0\n0\nto y2 or to y3 , as follows. Based on [Va2, 3.3.2] and Fact 6 of 2.3.11 (applied to the\nSHS (f1 , L1(p) , v1 )) we can assume z01 \u2208 C1 (V0 ). We start working with a finite morphism\nN1 /H01 \u2192 N /H00 , with H01 as in 2.3.3 and with H00 a compact, open subgroup of\nG0 (Apf ) containing the image of H01 . As G0 (Z(p) ) is dense in G0 (Apf ) (cf. the strong\napproximation theorem; see [Pr, Theorem A]), we can assume t0 mod H00 is naturally\ndefined by an element a \u2208 G0 (Z(p) ). Choosing H01 and H00 to be small enough, we can\nassume a leaves invariant X00 . So the part of 4.9.4 referring to automorphisms applies\nonce more: we can assume the images of z0 and z00 in N0 /H00 (V0 ) are the same. We can\nassume H01 and H00 are such that C1 /H010 \u2192 C0 /H000 is a Galois cover, with H0i0 as\nthe subgroup of H0i leaving Ci invariant, i = 0, 1. So, as in [Va2, 6.2.2 F)] (see also AE.4)\nwe can write C0 /H000 as the quotient of C1 /H010 through the action of a subgroup of\nautomorphisms of (G1 , X1 , H1 ). So there is a1 \u2208 Aut((G1 , X1 , H1 )) such that the images\nof z10 and of ia1 (z1 ) in C1 /H010 are the same. So the Proposition follows from the proof\nof 4.9.4 and from Fact 6 of 2.3.11 (applied to SHS (f1 , L1 (p) , v1 )).\ny30\n\n4.9.7.1. Remark. A second proof of 4.9.7 can be obtained by combining 2.3.5.6-7.\n512\n\n\f4.9.8. Theorem. For any integral canonical model N of a Shimura quadruple\n(G, X, H, v) of preabelian type, with v diving a rational prime p \u2265 3, there is a unique\nG(Apf )-invariant stratification (called the refined canonical Lie stratification) of Nk(v) in\nreduced, locally closed subschemes such that:\na) if G is not a torus, its strata are indexed by a subset of the set RLN P (Gad , X ad , v ad )\n(defined in 4.5.7 and 4.5.8 1)); if G is a torus, then we have only one stratum;\nb) it is functorial w.r.t. finite maps between Shimura quadruples;\nc) it has a unique open stratum U (so U is dense in Nk(v) );\nd) any point y : Spec(k) \u2192 U, with k a perfect field, has a uniquely determined\nG-canonical lift z : Spec(W (k)) \u2192 N (here the uniqueness part is implied by e) and f )\nbelow; however, see also 4.9.17.1 below);\ne) the G-canonical lifts are functorial w.r.t. finite maps between Shimura quadruples;\nf ) if N and (G, X, H, v) are related to a SHS (f, L(p) , v) as in 4.1, then it is the\nrefined canonical Lie stratification of 4.5.2 and we reobtain the G-canonical lifts of 4.4.2;\ng) it is invariant under isomorphisms, i.e. it is invariant under the natural action\nof the group Aut((G, X, H)) (defined in [Va2, 3.2.7 9)]) on Nk(v) .\nProof: For the case p = 3 we refer to \u00a76. We assume now p \u2265 5. If G is a torus,\nthen the Theorem is trivial (cf. [Va2, 3.2.8 and 3.3.3]). We assume now G is not a torus.\nLet\n(G0 , X0 , H0 , v0 ) := (Gad , X ad , H ad , v ad ).\nWe use the notations of 4.9.1-7. We recall: in order to define the set RLN P (G0 , X0 , v0 ),\na bijection fH\u0303 as in 4.3.2 is chosen.\nA point y0 \u2208 N (F) belongs to the stratum indexed by some s \u2208 RLN P (G0 , X0 , v0 )\niff there is t0 \u2208 G0 (Apf ) such that the right translate y0t of y0 through t0 belongs to C0 (F)\nand the sequence of Newton polygons defined by cyclic factors of the Shimura adjoint\nLie \u03c3\u0304-crystal attached to y0t , is the same as that of s; 4.9.4 and 4.9.7 guarantee that this\nis well defined. The fact that the things do not depend on the connected component X00\nof X0 we chose is implied by [Va2, 3.3.3]. So, from very definitions the refined canonical\nstratification of Nk(v) is G(Apf )-invariant.\nTo see that the partition of N0 (F) in disjoint subsets defines locally closed subschemes of N0k(v0 ) we just have to remark that the pull back (of these disjoint sets) to\nN1 (F) through the morphism j1 (of 4.9.1) are forming the partition of N1 (F) in subsets\ncorresponding to the refined canonical Lie stratification of N1 k(v1 ) defined (see 4.5.2) by\nthe SHS (f1 , L1(p) , v1 ). So [Va2, 6.4.5.1] applies. This takes care of a) and f).\nThe stratification of Nk(v) is obtained from the one of N0 k(v0 ) by the pull back\noperation through the natural morphism N \u2192 N0 (see [Va2, 3.2.7 4)]). This takes care\nof b), while c) results from 4.2.1, via [Va2, 6.4.5.1]. The existence and uniqueness of\nG-canonical lifts is a direct consequence of the following remark (it is just a particular\ncase of the filtered versions of 4.9.4 and 4.9.7, cf. 4.4.1 1)):\n513\n\n\f(4.9.8.1) If in 4.9.4 (resp. in 4.9.7) z2 (resp. z20 ) is a Shimura-canonical lift, then\nz1 and z3 (resp. z10 and z30 ) are also Shimura-canonical lifts.\nSo it makes sense to say that z0 is a G0 -canonical lift of y0 . For a point y : Spec(k) \u2192\nNk(v) of the open stratum, with k just a perfect field, we first get a G-canonical lift\nz\u0304 : Spec(W (k1 )) \u2192 N (with k1 a pro-finite Galois extension of k) of the point \u0233 \u2208 N (k1 )\nfactoring through y, which due to the uniqueness property asserted by c) and to (4.9.8.1),\nit is defined over W (k), i.e. we get a G-canonical lift z : Spec(W (k)) \u2192 Nk(v) of y. This\ntakes care of d) and e).\nTo check that the refined canonical Lie stratification of Nk(v) is invariant under the\naction of Aut((G, X, H)), we can assume G = G0 (cf. the definition of Aut((G, X, H))).\nBut in this case the arguments of the proof of 4.9.4 apply entirely; we just need to:\n\u2013 replace inner automorphisms a1 of (G1 , X1 ) by isomorphisms a2 : (G1 , X1 )\u2192(G\n \u0303 1 , X2 )\n(with X2 uniquely determined by X1 and a2 ), and to\n\u2013 point out that we can always choose f1 such that 2.3.6 applies to it (cf. the\nExistence Property of 1.10); so 2.3.6 applies as well to f \u25e6 a\u22121\n2 .\nThis takes care of g) and ends the proof.\n4.9.8.2. Corollary. We assume dimC (X) > 0. Then the complement in Nk(v) of\nthe open, dense stratum of the refined canonical Lie stratification is a G(Apf )-invariant\nclosed subscheme of Nk(v) , different from Nk(v) and of pure codimension 1.\nProof: [Va2, 6.4.2 and 6.4.5.1] makes the reduction (cf. the proof of 4.9.8) of the\nsituation to the case when we have a SHS. But this case is handled by 4.3.6. This ends\nthe proof of the Corollary.\nThis Corollary fulfills the promise of the end of the first paragraph of [Va2, 3.2.12].\n4.9.9. Variants. A result entirely similar to 4.9.8 can be stated in the context of:\ni) canonical Lie stratifications (defined for a SHS in 4.5.1);\nii) (refined) Lie (non-) stable stratifications (defined for a SHS in 4.5.15);\niii) quasi-ultra stratifications (defined for a SHS in 4.5.15.2);\niv) Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Dieudonn\u00e9 adjoint stratifications (defined for a SHS in 4.5.16).\nThe same proof applies (it is the simple Lemma 4.10.0 below which allows us to\nspeak about the quasi-ultra stratification of Nk(v) and not only of NF ). In \u00a710 we will\nsee that this remains true, even in the context of the absolute and so in the context\nof the ultra stratifications: using 4.5.6.1 and 4.9.8 we get this just for the Cn types\n(and for other particular situations pertaining to the Bn types), n \u2208 N. Here we just\nmention, that the argument (of the proof of 4.9.4) used to get 4.9.8 g), applies entirely\nto give us that the \u03c1's stratifications (and so also the absolute, the pseudo-ultra, the\nultra and the Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Dieudonn\u00e9 adjoint or standard stratification) of 4.5 are\nAut((G, X, H))-invariant.\n514\n\n\fAlso 4.5.16 a) to c) and 4.5.16.1 extend automatically to all these Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013\nDieudonn\u00e9 adjoint stratifications.\n4.9.9.1. Ultimate type of stratifications. For what follows we refer to (the proof\nof) 4.9.8; see also 2.3.3.2 and 2.3.5.4. We consider the Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Dieudonn\u00e9 adjoint stratification of N0k(v0 ) . Its pull back to N1 is the Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Dieudonn\u00e9\nadjoint stratification as defined in 4.5.16. By the ultimate adjoint stratification of Nk(v)\nwe mean the pull back to Nk(v) of the maximal (i.e. the most refined) G0 (Apf )-invariant,\nAut(G0 , X0 , H0 )-invariant stratification of N0k(v0 ) whose strata are open, closed subschemes of the Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Dieudonn\u00e9 adjoint stratification of N0k(v0 ) .\nWe now refer to 4.5.16. By the ultimate stratification of Nk(v) we mean the most\nrefined G(Apf )-invariant, Aut(G, X, H)-invariant stratification of Nk(v) whose strata are\nopen, closed subschemes of the Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Dieudonn\u00e9 stratification of Nk(v) .\nBased on 4.5.16 and 4.5.16.1 and the last sentence of 4.9.9, 4.5.16 a) to c) and 4.5.16.1\nextend automatically to all these ultimate (adjoint) stratifications.\n4.9.9.2. Grothendieck's specialization category. We refer to 4.5.16 (resp. to\n4.9.8). By Grothendieck's specialization category (resp. adjoint category)\nGSC(Nk(v) ) (resp. GSAC(Nk(v) ))\nof Nk(v) we mean the category:\n1) whose objects are the reduced, locally closed subschemes of Nk(v) which are strata\nof the ultimate (resp. ultimate adjoint) stratification of Nk(v) ;\n2) whose set of morphisms from one object (stratum) s1 to another object (stratum\ns2 ) is empty or has precisely one element depending on the fact that each (it is enough\none) connected component of s1 specializes to some connected component of s2 .\nGSAC(Nk(v) ) depends only on the integral canonical model of (Gad , X ad , H ad , v ad ).\nHowever, there are many very important ways to look at it (and its subcategories) and\nso it is relevant to think of it of being \"of Nk(v) \". We have a canonical functor\nGSC(Nk(v) ) \u2192 GSAC(Nk(v) )\nwhich takes a stratum of the ultimate stratification to the corresponding stratum of the\nultimate stratification of Nk(v) . We do not know when it is an isomorphism of categories.\nWe have a variant of GSC(Nk(v) ) (resp. of GSAC(Nk(v) )): we allow the strata to be\nin the sense of 2.1; so the objects are elements of the class of the ultimate (resp. ultimate\nadjoint) stratification of Nk(v) . Another variant, we fix an algebraically closed field k\ncontaining F and we define GSC(Nk ) (resp. GSAC(Nk )) using reduced, locally closed\nsubschemes of Nk which are strata of the ultimate (resp. ultimate adjoint) stratification\nof Nk(v) .\n4.9.9.3. Remark. One might worry that the ultimate adjoint stratifications are\ntoo refined, i.e. that too many strata of them have very low dimensions. We think this\n515\n\n\fis not relevant, as one of the main goals of them is to solve the Real Problem of 1.6.5;\nso the categories of 4.9.9.2 do \"capture\" all the information one might think is lost by\npassing to too refined stratifications (providing \u2013in the same time\u2013 a lot more). On the\nother hand, from the Example of 3.15.7 H we get (cf. also the regularity part of 4.5.15.6;\nthe passage from SHS's to the preabelian type context is achieved via the proof of 4.9.8):\nCorollary. The dimension of the stratum of the ultra stratification of Nk(v) to\nwhich an F-valued toric point y of Nk(v) belongs is at least the negative sp-invariant of\nthe Shimura adjoint Lie \u03c3\u0304-crystal attached to (see 4.9.5 and 4.9.17 below) y.\n4.9.10. Definition. The points with values in perfect fields of the open, dense\nstratum of Nk(v) /H\u03030 (with H\u03030 a compact subgroup of G(Apf )) are called G-ordinary (or\nGW (k(v)) -ordinary or Shimura-ordinary) points.\n4.9.11. Corollary. We have a natural functor from the full subcategory of qf-Sh of\nwhose objects are Shimura quadruples (G, X, H, v) of preabelian type, with (v, 2) = 1, to\nthe category of stratified schemes (in reduced, locally closed subschemes) whose morphisms\nare morphisms of schemes such that the pull back of any stratum is a stratum, taking such\na quadruple into the scheme defined by the special fibre of its integral canonical model\nand endowed with the refined canonical Lie stratification (the action of the functor on\nmorphisms being the logical one, cf. [Va2, 3.2.7 4)]).\nThis is a consequence of the proof of 4.9.8. We have variants of it: cf. 4.9.9.\n4.9.12. Corollary. Under the right translation by an element of G(Apf ), a Gcanonical lift of N is taken into a G-canonical lift.\n4.9.13. Remark. Let H\u03030 be an arbitrary compact subgroup of G(Apf ). As in\n4.4.2.1 we define uniquely the G-canonical lift Spec(W (k)) \u2192 N /H\u03030 of a G-ordinary point\n\u0001\nSpec(k) \u2192 Nk(v) /H\u03030 . In \u00a712 we will see (cf. 4.4.6) that a G-canonical lift Spec W (F) \u2192\nN /H\u03030 gives birth to a special point Spec(B(F)) \u2192 ShH\u03030 (G, X).\n4.9.14. Refined canonical stratifications. We start with a question. With the\nnotations of 4.5, is it true that the f -canonical stratification of Nk(v) defined in 4.5.9 is\nindeed canonical, i.e. it does not depend on the SHS (f, L(p) , v) producing it?\nThe expectation (cf. 4.5.9) of the existence of a refined f -canonical stratification of\nNk(v) , suggests (in general) a negative answer to this question. It seems to us, that the\nsupposed existing refined f -canonical stratification of Nk(v) (cf. 4.5.9), still depends in\ngeneral on the SHS producing it (and so that we can not stop mentioning \"f -\"). However,\none could proceed as in 4.9.8 to define a refined canonical stratification of Nk(v) which\ndoes not depend on f (sort of intersection of all refined f -canonical stratifications of\nNk(v) ); using this one could define the refined canonical stratification of the special fibre\nof any integral canonical model as in 4.9.8.\n4.9.15. An expectation. Even before one truly defines the refined canonical\nstratifications modeled on [Oo3] (i.e. in the sense of 4.5.9 and 4.9.14), we formulate here\nour feelings:\n516\n\n\fExpectation. The quasi-ultra stratification of Nk(v) coincides with or is a refinement of the refined canonical stratification of Nk(v) , whenever this last stratification can\nbe satisfactorily defined.\nFor instance, it is easy to see that in the case of Siegel modular varieties they coincide\n(cf. [Oo3] and 1) of 3.13.7.4 D)).\n4.9.16. Exercise. a) Show that the theory of good G-multiplicative (or G-additive)\ncoordinates presented in 4.7.14 extends to the case of Shimura-ordinary points of an\nintegral canonical model N as in 4.9.8.\nb) If the prime v ad of E(Gad , X ad ) divided by v has Fp as its residue field, then the\nG-multiplicative coordinates we get are canonical (i.e. are uniquely determined).\nHint: for the canonical part, use 4.7.11 4) and the idea of the proof of 4.9.4.\n4.9.17. Some extensions. Let (G, X, H, v), p and N be as in 4.9.8. Let y \u2208\nN (k), with k an algebraically closed field of characteristic p. Till the end of 4.9.17.5,\nwe assume G is not a torus. Let N0 be the integral canonical model of the quadruple\n(G0 , X0 , H0 , v0 ) := (Gad , X ad , H ad , v ad ) and let y0 \u2208 N0 (k) be the composite of y with\nthe natural morphism N \u2192 N0 . Let C0 be the open closed subscheme of N0 defined as in\n4.9.1.1, starting from a fixed connected component of X. Let h \u2208 Gad (Apf ) be such that\nthe translation y01 of y0 by h belongs to C0 (k) (cf. [Va2, 3.3.2]). The Shimura adjoint\nLie \u03c3k -crystal Cad\ny01 (cf. 4.9.5) is called the Shimura adjoint Lie \u03c3k -crystal attached to y.\nIt is attached to a Shimura \u03c3k -crystal.\nThe reason why is this well defined is nothing else but 4.9.4, 4.9.7 and the proof of\n4.9.8 (performed for W (k) instead of V0 ). In the case of a SHS (f, L(p) , v) we recover the\ndefinition (see 2.3.10) of a Shimura adjoint Lie \u03c3k -crystal attached to a point y \u2208 N (k).\n4.9.17.0. The quasi-affine, regular property. We have:\nCorollary. Each stratum S0 of the quasi-ultra (or ultimate adjoint, or Faltings\u2013\nShimura\u2013Dieudonn\u00e9 adjoint) stratification of Nk(v) is regular and quasi-affine. Moreover,\nany stratum of the ultra stratification of Nk(v) is quasi-affine.\nProof: The regularity part follows from 4.5.15.2.2, 4.5.16 and the proof of 4.9.8 (cf.\nalso 4.9.9). The quasi-affineness part follows from 4.5.15.2.5 and the proof of 4.9.8 (cf.\nalso 4.9.9).\n4.9.17.0.0. Remark. Based on global forms of 2.3.9 and on 2.3.15.1 (or just based\non the existence of actions T as in 3.13.7.1; their orbits are always integral subschemes of\nreductive groups and so are quasi-affine), in \u00a75 we will reobtain the quasi-affineness part\nof the above Corollary, without appealing (see 4.5.9) to [Oo3].\n4.9.17.1. Remark. In the situation of 4.9.17, we similarly define the Shimura\nadjoint filtered Lie \u03c3k -crystal attached to a point Spec(W (k)) \u2192 N . So the canonical\nlifts Spec(W (k)) \u2192 N can be recognized (see 4.4.1 2)) as follows: their Shimura adjoint\nfiltered Lie \u03c3k -crystals are (cyclic diagonalizable and) of parabolic (and Borel) type.\n517\n\n\f4.9.17.2. Definitions. A point y : Spec(k1 ) \u2192 Nk(v) , with k1 a perfect field, is\ncalled a toric point if the Shimura adjoint Lie \u03c3k1 -crystal attached to the k1 -valued point\nof Nk(v) naturally defined by y is isomorphic to the extension to k1 of the Shimura adjoint\nLie \u03c3\u0304-crystal attached to a Shimura \u03c3\u0304-crystal C\u03c9 showing up in 4.1.5, for an adequately\nchosen SHS (f, L(p) , v). If C\u03c9 is a U -ordinary (resp. T -ordinary) \u03c3\u0304-crystal, then y is\ncalled an U -ordinary (resp. T -ordinary) point. Similarly to 4.4.0 we define Borel and\nreductive points of Nk(v) .\n4.9.17.2.1. Some implications. 3.11.6 B) implies that any k1 -valued Borel point\nis a Shimura-ordinary point and the converse holds if k1 = k1 . Also 2.2.19.2 and the\nCriterion of 2.2.22 1) imply that any toric point is a reductive point.\n4.9.17.3. Extension of 4.5.11 and 4.5.13. 4.9.4 and 4.9.7 show that the notion\nof toric point is intrinsic (canonical). In particular, if (G, X, H, v) is obtained from a SHS\n(f, L(p) , v), then we \"regain\" the toric points defined in 4.5.11.2. Moreover, 4.12.12.6 below shows that there are plenty of toric points which are not G-ordinary. As in 4.5.11.2.1,\nthe toric points can be defined in terms of Galois representations (for p = 3 cf. also the\nCriterion of 2.2.22 1)).\nMoreover, due to the same reasons, we can speak about CM levels of non-toric points\nof Nk(v) with values in algebraically closed fields and so, by natural extension, with values\nin fields.\n4.9.17.4. Remark. Based on 4.9.17, it makes sense to speak, as in 3.6.16 1), about\nN having the completion property: we just have to rephrase 3.6.15 A in terms of Shimura\nadjoint Lie \u03c3k -crystals attached to geometric points of N .\n4.9.17.5. U -canonical lifts. From 4.4.13.2 we get, as in the part of the proof\nof 4.9.8 referring to G-canonical lifts, that any U -ordinary point y : Spec(k1 ) \u2192 Nk(v) ,\nwith k1 a perfect field, has a uniquely determined lift z : Spec(W (k1 )) \u2192 N (called the\nU -canonical lift of y) with the property that the Shimura adjoint filtered Lie \u03c3k1 -crystal\nattached to the W (k1 )-valued point of N factoring through z, is of toric type. As in 4.9.8\nb), U -canonical lifts are functorial w.r.t. finite maps between Shimura quadruples.\n4.9.18. Comment. We think the terminology (refined) canonical Lie stratification\nis justified. The word Lie is meant to distinguish it from the other \u03c1-stratifications\nintroduced in 4.5.4 (for a SHS), while the word canonical is meant to emphasize that\nin the case of a Shimura quadruple (G, X, H, v) emerging from a SHS (f, L(p) , v), the\n(refined) (canonical) Lie stratification we get for Nk(v) does not depend on the SHS\n(f, L(p) , v) producing it.\n4.9.19. Exercise. Let (Gi , Xi , Hi , vi ), i = 1, 2, be two Shimura quadruples of\npreabelian type, with v1 and v2 dividing the same prime p \u2265 3. Let w be a prime of\nE(G1 \u00d7 G2 , X1 \u00d7 X2 ) dividing v1 and v2 . We get a Shimura quadruple\n(G1 \u00d7 G2 , X1 \u00d7 X2 , H1 \u00d7 H2 , w).\n518\n\n\fLet Mi be the extension to Spec(O(w) ) of the integral canonical model Ni of (Gi , Xi , Hi , vi ),\ni = 1, 2. It is known that\nM := M1 \u00d7O(w) M2\nis the integral canonical model of (G1 \u00d7 G2 , X1 \u00d7 X2 , H1 \u00d7 H2 , w) (cf. [Va2, 3.2.16]).\nShow that the refined canonical Lie stratification of Mk(w) is the product stratification\nof the refined canonical Lie stratifications of M1k(v) and of M2k(v) . Hint: first reduce to\nthe case when G1 \u00d7 G2 is an adjoint group and then use [Va2, 6.5.1].\n4.9.20. Exercise. With the notations of 4.9.17, let H0 be a compact subgroup\nof G(Apf ) such that either p 6 |t(Gad ) and H0 \u00d7 H is a subgroup of G(Af ) smooth for\n(G, X) or p|t(Gad ) and H0 \u00d7 H is p-smooth for (G, X). Show that for any morphism\nfs : Spec(R) \u2192 N /H0 , with R a faithfully flat, regular, formally smooth W (k)-algebra,\nwe can define uniquely the Shimura adjoint filtered Lie F -crystal (over Spec(R/pR))\nattached to fs .\nA proof of this exercise will be given in \u00a75. In what follows we need it only in the\ncase when R/pR is integral and the first fundamental group of Spec(R/pR) is trivial:\nthis case can be treated entirely as in (the filtered versions of) 4.9.3-4 and 4.9.7 (where\nwe had R/pR = F).\n4.9.21. The relative Oort\u2013Moonen problem. Let (G, X, H, v) be a Shimura\nquadruple of preabelian type, with v dividing a prime p > 2. Let N be its integral\ncanonical model (cf. [Va2, 6.4.1] for p > 3 and cf. \u00a76 for p = 3). Let F be a number field\ncontaining E(G, X). Let H0 \u2282 G(Apf ) be as in 4.9.20. Let Z be an irreducible subvariety\nof ShH0 \u00d7H (G, X)F . Let Z(v) be the Zariski closure of Z in (N /H0 )F(v) , with F(v) as the\nnormalization of O(v) in F .\nProblem. We assume there is a prime w of F dividing v and a G-ordinary point\ny : Spec(k(v)) \u2192 Nk(w) /H0 factoring through the special fibre of Z(v) , such that Z(v) has\n(see below) formally quasi-linear components at y. Show that Z is of preabelian type,\ni.e. for any embedding F \u0592\u2192 C, every irreducible component of Z \u00d7F C is a subvariety of\nNC /H0 of preabelian type (in the sense of [Mo, 3.7]).\nDue to the existence of G-multiplicative coordinates (see 4.9.16) the notion of having\nformally quasi-linear components at y can be defined as in [Mo]. It seems to us that we\ncan use 4.7.11 and 4.7.17, to prove that this notion is independent of all choices referred\nto in 4.7.11 8); if this turns out not to be the case, then we have to define this notion by\nworking w.r.t. all \u2013allowed, i.e. logical\u2013 choices mentioned in 4.7.11 8).\nFor not being too long, we simplify the things by just giving an example (without\nbeing particular about the precise choices defining G-multiplicative coordinates) in the\ncase when w is unramified over v. If the closed subscheme (defined naturally by Z(v) )\nof the spectrum of the completion of the local ring of the point y1 : Spec(k(v)) \u2192\nNW (k(v)) /H0 defined by y, is a formal subtorus of the formal torus (of G-multiplicative\ncoordinates) defined (see 4.9.16) by the G-ordinary point y1 , then (by very definitions)\nZ(v) has formally quasi-linear components at y.\n519\n\n\f4.9.21.1. Exercise. Using [Mo, 5.2] show that the relative Oort\u2013Moonen problem\nis true if k(v ad ) = Fp (here v ad is the prime of E(Gad , X ad ) divided by v). Hint: use\n4.7.11 4) and [Va2, 6.5.1.1] (referring to the Existence Property of 1.10, if k(v0 ) = Fp ,\nthen based on arguments of loc. cit. we can assume k(v 0 ) = Fp ).\n4.9.22. Definition. A simple, adjoint Shimura variety Sh(G, X) is said to be\nof Z-End type if there is a principally polarized abelian variety (A, pA ) over C, with\nEnd(A) = Z, whose attached (see 2.1) Shimura variety has Sh(G, X) as its adjoint variety.\nWe refer to the situation of 4.9.2. Let E be a number field. Let H00 be the subgroup\nof G0 (Apf ) generated by the images of H01 and H02 . We recall, cf. 2.3.3, that H0i is a\ncompact, open subgroup of Gi (Apf ) subject to some conditions, i \u2208 {1, 2}. Accordingly,\nwe assume H00 is compact as well. We consider two morphisms\na(i) : Spec(E) \u2192 ShH0i \u00d7Hi (Gi , Xi ),\ni \u2208 {1, 2}, giving birth to the same morphism Spec(E) \u2192 ShH00 \u00d7H0 (G0 , X0 ). Let Ai\nbe the abelian variety over E naturally associated to a(i) and the embedding fi of 4.9.1\n(implicitly, a Z-lattice Li of Wi such that we get a perfect form \u03c8i : Li \u2297Z Li \u2192 Z is a\npriori chosen; see 2.3.2). We have:\n4.9.23. Corollary. The ordinary conjecture is true for A1 iff it is true for A2 .\nProof: We can assume E is big enough so that Gab\niE , i = 1, 2, are split tori. We\nconsider only those primes of E such that:\na) they are unramified over rational primes;\nb) their residue fields have a prime number of elements;\nc) A1 \u00d7 A2 has good reduction w.r.t. them.\nThe set of such primes has Dirichlet density 1. Let w be such a prime. Above, the\nrole of p is just to fix some notations (without introducing others); so, based on [Va2,\n5.8.6] (to be compared with the proof of 4.6.2.1) we deduce that we can assume k(w) = Fp .\nFrom a) and c) we deduce the existence of a O(vi ) -morphism b(i) : Spec(W (F)) \u2192 Ni\nwhose generic fibre factors through a(i). From 4.9.4 we get that the Shimura adjoint Lie\n\u03c3\u0304-crystal attached to b(1) is ordinary iff the Shimura adjoint Lie \u03c3\u0304-crystal attached to\nb(2) is so. From b) and 4.3.1.1 we get that at the level of T -degrees of definition we have\ndT (v1 ) = dT (v2 ) = 1. So from end of 4.3.1.1 and 4.6 P1 we get: A1 has an ordinary\nreduction w.r.t. w iff A2 has. The Corollary follows.\nThe ordinary reduction is true for a (finite) product of abelian varieties over a number\nfield iff it is true for each member of it. Based on this and on [Va2, 6.5.1], from 4.9.23\nand [Pi, 7.2] we get:\n4.9.23.1. Corollary. Let A be an abelian variety over a number field E. We assume\nthe Shimura variety attached to it is such that all simple factors of its adjoint variety are\nof Z-End type and are not of Cn type with n \u2265 3. Then the ordinary conjecture is true\nfor A.\n520\n\n\f4.9.23.2. Exercise. Show that there are situations to which 4.9.23.1 applies, with\nA an absolutely simple abelian variety such that End(A\u0112 ) 6= Z. Hint: use Mumford\ncurves and 2.3.5.1; for more sophisticated examples, use [Va2, 6.4.2 and 6.5-6] and move\nfrom the A1 Lie type to the Bn Lie types, with n \u2208 N congruent to 1 or 2 mod 4.\n4.10. Hecke orbits of G-ordinary points. Let (G, H, H, v) be a Shimura quadruple of preabelian type, with (v, 2) = 1, and let N be its integral canonical model over\nO(v) . Let U \u0592\u2192 Nk(v) be the open, dense subscheme of G-ordinary points (cf. 4.9.8). We\nhave:\n4.10.0. Lemma. The field of fractions F F (C0 ) of any connected component C0 of\nNk(v) contains F.\nProof: For p = 3 we refer to \u00a76. Let now p \u2265 5. From 2.3.9 A we get that the\nLemma holds for a SHS. We can assume (G, H, H, v) is adjoint. So, from [Va2, 6.4.1-2,\n6.2.2, 6.2.3.1 and 6.2.3] we get that F F (C0 ) contains a subfield of F whose Galois group\nis an M -torsion group for some M \u2208 N. As such a subfield must be F itself, the Lemma\nfollows.\n4.10.1. Conjecture. U is the smallest non-empty open subscheme of Nk(v) which\nis G(Apf )-invariant.\n4.10.1.1. Reformulation. Standard arguments (based on 4.10.0) show that another way to formulate 4.10.1 is: the Hecke orbit o(y) of a k\u0304-valued G-ordinary point y (of\nUk\u0304 ) with values in k\u0304, i.e. the set of points obtained from y through G(Apf )-translations, is\ndense in Nk\u0304 . In other words, o(y) is never contained in a closed subscheme of Nk\u0304 which\nis not Nk\u0304 itself.\n4.10.2. Motivations. The expectations of the validity of 4.10.1 are based on:\na) 4.2.8.1;\nb) exercise 8) of 4.5.6;\nc) the part d) (or c)) of 4.4.1 3), and b) and c) of 4.4.1 2);\nd) the validity of 4.10.1 in the case when Sh(G, X) is a Siegel modular variety [Ch2];\ne) 4.10.3 and 4.10.5.1 below.\n4.10.3. Proposition. The above conjecture is true if dimC (X) \u2264 1.\nProof: If dimC (X) = 0, i.e. if G is a torus, this is obvious (cf. [Va2, 3.2.8 and\n3.3.1]). If dimC (X) = 1, then 4.2.8.1 holds: the case of non-compact Shimura curves,\ni.e. of Shimura curves having the same adjoint curve as the elliptic modular curve, is a\nconsequence of [FC, ch. IV, 5.10 and 6.12]. From 4.9.12 and from the fact the G(Apf )orbit of the B(k\u0304)-valued point of Sh(G, X)B(k\u0304) defined by the G-canonical lift of y is\ndense in Sh(G, X)B(k\u0304) , we get that o(y) is dense in Nk\u0304 . This ends the proof.\n4.10.4. Variants. There are variants of 4.10.1. For instance by working not with\nthe full group G(Apf ) of Hecke operators but just with G(Qq ), where q is a rational prime,\n521\n\n\fdifferent from p and such that G is unramified over Qq (cf. [Ch2]), or more generally\nwith an adequate (i.e. of interest) subgroup of G(Apf ). However in such a variant we\nhave to be careful: G(Qq ) might not permute transitively the connected components of\nShH (G, X)C (for instance, this happens when GQp is anisotropic).\nAnother variant consists in replacing G-ordinary points and U respectively by G(\u03c9)ordinary points and by the s\u03c9 (or by the sa\u03c9 ) stratum (of 4.5.11.1). Again some precautions\nhave to be taken: (theoretically) we might not get dense Hecke orbits. So in some of these\nvariants 4.10.1 needs to be reformulated.\n4.10.5. Remark. The gluing principle of 3.6.19 D can be interpreted as a local\nHecke correspondence. Using this we will prove in [Va7] the following IOTA (if one then\nall) criterion:\n4.10.5.1. Criterion. Let (G, X, H, v) be a quadruple of preabelian type, with\nk(v ) = Fp . We assume that either p \u2265 3 or p = 2 and the Shimura quadruple\n(G, X, H, v) is associated to a p = 2 SHS. Let U be the G-ordinary locus of the integral canonical model N of (G, X, H, v) (for p = 2 cf. 4.14.3 A below). If the G(Apf )-orbit\nof a (one given) F-valued G-ordinary point of U is dense in Nk(v) (i.e. it is dense in U),\nthen the G(Apf )-orbit of any G-ordinary point of U is dense in Nk(v) .\nad\n\nThis criterion recovers all previous known cases of density of Hecke orbits in positive\ncharacteristic and provides plenty of new examples of such densities (like the case of\nclassical Spin modular varieties, see [Va2, 5.7.5] and [Va4]). The philosophy behind it\ncan be roughly formulated as follows:\nPh. We refer to 4.7.11 7) and we assume S(1, n)0 is the empty set. Under the\nmentioned interpretation, in the N-pro-\u00e9tale topology of Spec(Rnal /pRnal ), the Hecke correal\nal\nspondences associated to Cal\nq and two distinct k-valued points y1 and y2 of Spec(Rn /pRn ),\nare \"very close\" to the translation by the k-valued point \"y2 \u2212y1 \" of Spec(Rnal /pRnal ) (w.r.t.\nits natural group structure as a torus). Here \"very close\" refers to the fact that we need\nto change the initial Frobenius lift of (the p-adic completion of ) Rnal in order to get exactly\nthe mentioned translation.\n4.11. The functorial behavior of G-ordinary points.\n4.11.1. Two questions. We\n\u0001 consider now a SHS (f, L(p) , v) defined by an injective\nmap f : (G, X) \u0592\u2192 GSp(W, \u03c8), S which factors as the composite f1 \u25e6 f2\u0001 of two injective\nmaps, with f2 : (G, X) \u0592\u2192 (G1 , X1 ) and f1 : (G1 , X1 ) \u0592\u2192 GSp(W, \u03c8), S . Let v1 be the\nprime of E(G1 , X1 ) divided by v. We assume the triple (f1 , L(p) , v1 ) is as well a SHS.\nWe still use for it the standard notations of 2.3.1-3 but everything having a right lower\nindex 1, except L(p) . We have a natural morphism i1 : N \u2192 N1 (cf. [Va2, 3.2.7 4)]).\nTwo natural questions arise:\nQ1. When i1 takes G-ordinary points of Nk(v) into G1 -ordinary points of N1 k(v1 ) ?\nQ2. If i1 takes G-ordinary points of Nk(v) into G1 -ordinary points of N1 k(v1 ) , is\nit true that a G-canonical lift of a G-ordinary point y of Nk(v) is mapped by i1 into a\nG-canonical lift of i1 \u25e6 y?\n522\n\n\fQ1 can be reformulated (cf. 4.2.1): when the open, dense stratum of Nk(v) is the\npull back through i1 of the open, dense stratum of N1 k(v1 ) ?\nThe case k(v1 ) = Fp is completely handled by 4.6 P1 and P2: the answer to Q1 is\nyes when k(v) = Fp , and then Q2 also has a positive answer. What about k(v1 ) = Fpq1\nwith q1 \u2208 N, q1 \u2265 2? As p \u2265 3, by combining 4.4.8 2), 2.3.17 and 3.1.1 c) we get:\n4.11.1.1. Corollary. The answer to Q2 is always yes.\nRelated to Q1 we have:\n4.11.2. Theorem. The morphism i1 maps G-ordinary points of Nk(v) into G1 ordinary points of N1k(v1 ) (and so G-canonical lifts of N into G1 -canonical lifts of N1 )\niff there is a triple (T, \u03bc, B1 ), with T a torus of GZp , with \u03bc an injective cocharacter of\nTW (k(v)) and with B1 a parabolic subgroup of G1 Zp , such that:\ni) Under extension via an O(v) -monomorphism W (k(v)) \u0592\u2192 C, \u03bc becomes G(C)conjugate to the cocharacters \u03bc\u2217x , x \u2208 X;\nii) Under the direct sum decomposition L\u2217p \u2297Zp W (k(v)) = F 1 \u2295 F 0 produced by \u03bc\n\u0001\n(\u03b2 \u2208 Gm W (k(v)) acts through \u03bc on F i as the multiplication with \u03b2 \u2212i ), F 1 is normalized\nby B1W (k(v)) (i.e. Lie(B1 ) \u2297Zp W (k(v)) \u2282 F 0 (Lie(G1W (k(v)) )));\niii) B1 \u2229 GZp contains a Borel subgroup B of GZp .\nMoreover, if such a triple (T, \u03bc, B1 ) does exist, then k(v) = k(v1 ).\nProof: Let (T, \u03bc, B1 ) be a triple of the mentioned form, such that i) to iii) hold.\nThe fact that i1 takes G-ordinary points of Nk(v) into G1 -ordinary points of N1k(v1 )\nresults from 4.1-2: the Shimura-ordinary type of the SHS (f, L(p) , v) (resp. of the SHS\n(f1 , L(p) , v1 )) can be computed, cf. 4.1.1, starting from the data of the triple (T, \u03bc, B)\n(resp. (T, \u03bc, B1 )); so these two Shimura-ordinary types are equal.\nWe now\n\u0001 assume i1 takes G-ordinary points into G1 -ordinary points. Let z :\nSpec W (F) \u2192 N be a G-canonical lift of a G-ordinary point y : Spec(F) \u2192 Nk(v) ,\nand let C := (My , Fz1 , \u03c6y , GW (F) ) be the Shimura filtered \u03c3\u0304-crystal attached to z. We get\nanother Shimura filtered \u03c3\u0304-crystal C1 := (My , Fz1 , \u03c6y , G1 W (F) ); it is the one attached to\ny2 \u25e6 z and (cf. 4.11.1.1) is a Shimura-canonical lift.\nThe canonical split cocharacter \u03bcy : Gm \u2192 GW (k) of C when composed with the\nmonomorphism GW (k) \u0592\u2192 G1 W (k) , is the canonical split of C1 (cf. 3.1.5). So the degree\nof definition of C is equal to the degree of definition of C1 and so (cf. 4.4.7) k(v) = k(v1 ).\nWriting \u03c6y = a\u03bcy ( p1 ), a becomes a \u03c3k -linear automorphism of My . Then Mya :=\n\n\b\nf \u03032\nx \u2208 My |a(x) = x is a Zp -structure on My . We get monomorphisms G\u0303Zp \u0592\u2192 G\u03031 Zp \u0592\u2192\nGL(Mya ) and a cocharacter \u03bcy : Gm \u0592\u2192 G\u0303W (k(v)) . All these are as in 4.4.7. Let B\u0303 be a\nBorel subgroup of G\u0303Zp normalizing Fz1 and such that \u03bcy factors through B\u0303W (k(v)) . Let\nB\u03031 be a parabolic subgroup of G\u03031 Zp normalizing Fz1 and containing B\u0303. The existence of\nB\u0303 is a direct consequence of b) of 4.4.1 2), while we can take B\u03031 such that the extension\n523\n\n\fto W (F) of its Lie algebra is the Lie subalgebra of Lie(G1W (F) ) corresponding to nonnegative slopes of (Lie(G1W (F) ), \u03c6y ), cf. the parabolic property of 4.4.1 1) and cf. the\nexistence of the Zp -structures of 3.11.2 C. Let T\u0303 be a maximal torus of B\u0303 such that \u03bcy\nfactors through T\u0303W (k(v)) , cf. 3.11.2 B.\nG\u0303Zp is an inner form of GZp (argument: Fontaine's comparison theory implies G\u0303Qp is\nan inner form of GQp ). So it makes sense to speak about inner isomorphisms G\u0303Zp \u2192G\n \u0303 Zp\nad\nad\nor G\u0303Zp \u2192G\n \u0303 Zp . The same applies in the context of G1Zp and G\u03031Zp .\nClaim*. We have inner isomorphisms G\u0303Zp \u2192G\n \u0303 Zp and G\u03031Zp \u2192G\n \u0303 1Zp , through which\nf \u03032 becomes the natural monomorphism f \u03042 : GZp \u0592\u2192 G1 Zp as subgroups of GL(L\u2217p ).\nSo i) to iii) hold for the triple (T, \u03bc, B1 ) corresponding to the triple (T\u0303 , \u03bcy , B\u03031 ) under\nthese isomorphisms. The Claim is implied by d) of 4.4.1 3) (applied to (f, L(p) , v) and\nz), via Lang's theorem; as we postponed the proof of d) of 4.4.1 3), we present another\nargument for why a triple (T, \u03bc, B1 ) of the mentioned form exists such that i) to iii) hold.\nThe fact that in c) of 4.4.1 3) we can take n = 1 or not for the SHS (f, L(p) , v) and\nfor the point y, is expressed in terms of a torsor of G\u0303Qp being trivial or not. But the\nad\nresulting torsor of G\u0303ad\nQp (i.e. of GQp ) is trivial, cf. b) of 4.4.1 2). So it corresponds to a\ntorsor of the group Z(G\u0303Qp ) = Z(GQp ). As this last group is included in T\u0303Qp (and so in\nB\u0303Qp and B\u03031Qp ), we can consider the twist (TQp , BQp , B1Qp ) of the triple (T\u0303Qp , B\u0303Qp , B\u03031Qp ).\nWe view TQp , BQp as subgroups of GQp and B1Qp as a subgroup of G1Qp . Let B (resp.\nB1 ) be the Zariski closure of BQp (resp. of B1Qp ) in GZp (resp. in G1Zp ). It is a Borel\n(resp. a parabolic) subgroup of GZp (resp. of G1Zp ), cf. Fact of 2.2.3 3). Let T be the\nZariski closure of TQp in GZp . It is a maximal torus (based on [Va2, 4.3.9] this can be\nread out from the adjoint context). But there is a unique cocharacter \u03bc of TW (k(v)) with\nthe property that i) to iii) hold for (T, \u03bc, B1 ) (this can be checked easily in the adjoint\ncontext). This ends the proof of the Theorem.\n4.11.3. Example. We consider the case when f2 satisfies the conditions:\na) The connected components of the origin of Z(G) and of Z(G1 ) coincide;\nb) Gad = ResF/Q Gs , with F a totally real number field and with Gs an absolutely\nsimple F -group;\nad\nc) f2 induces an injective map f2ad : (Gad , X ad ) \u0592\u2192 (Gad\n1 , X1 ) which is the injective\nmap f2 F1 : Sh(Gad , X ad ) \u0592\u2192 ShF1 (Gad , X ad ) defined in [Va2, 6.6.1] (with F1 a totally\ns\nad\nad\nreal number field containing F ) (i.e. Gad\n\u0592\u2192 Gad\n1 = ResF1 /Q GF1 and f2 : G\n1 is the\ncanonical inclusion).\n\nThen E(G1 , X1 ) = E(G, X) and 4.11.2 i) to iii) hold for the triple (T, \u03bc, B1 ), where\n(T, \u03bc, B) is a triple constructed as in 4.1 for the SHS (f, L(p) , v) and such that B contains\nT , and where B1 is the unique Borel subgroup of G1Zp containing B. We get (cf. also\n4.11.1.1):\n524\n\n\fFact. i1 takes G-ordinary points of Nk(v) into G1 -ordinary points of N1k(v1 ) and\nG-canonical lifts of N into G1 -canonical lifts of N1 .\nThis Fact will be used in \u00a76 and \u00a712 (in connection to 1.15.8).\n4.11.4. A third question. There is an extra natural question related to 4.11.2:\nQ3. Does i1 automatically take G-ordinary points into G1 -ordinary points if we know\nonly that k(v) = k(v1 )?\n4.11.5. Remark. If k(v) = k(v1 ) 6= Fp the answer to Q3 is (in general) no.\nThere are many examples with G a torus which provide a negative answer to Q3. If\nk(v) = k(v1 ) = Fp then a triple (T, \u03bc, B1 ) such that 4.11.2 i) to iii) hold, automatically\nexists and this motivates the form of 4.6 P1 and P2.\n4.11.6. Example. Here we concentrate just on Shimura \u03c3-crystals (4.12.12.6 below\ntells that everything below can be realized geometrically). What follows is very much\nrelated to the part of the proof of 4.3.6 involving the completion property. We assume\nad\nGab\nZp is a split torus and GZp is an absolutely simple, non-split group of Al Lie type (so\nl \u2265 2); so Gad\nZp splits over W (Fp2 ). Let B be a Borel subgroup of GZp . Let T be a\nmaximal torus of it. As GZp splits over W (Fp2 ), so does B and T . We assume we have\nl+1\nad\na SHS (f, L(p) , v) such that Gad\nR = SU (a, l + 1 \u2212 a)R , for some a \u2208 S(1, l) \\ { 2 }. We\nalso assume that the reflex field E(G, X) (it is a quadratic totally imaginary extension of\nQ) has precisely one unramified prime v above p; so k(v) = Fp2 . Let \u03bc : Gm \u2192 TW (Fp2 )\nbe a cocharacter such that the conditions of 4.1 are satisfied (for (f, L(p) , v)).\n\u0001\nLet \u03c9 \u2208 GZp W (Fp2 ) normalizing TW (Fp2 ) and taking BW (Fp2 ) into its opposite\nopp\n\u2217\nBW\n(F 2 ) (see 4.1.4.1). Let \u03c31 := \u03c9\u03c3\u0304; we view it as a \u03c3\u0304-linear automorphism of L(p) \u2297Z(p)\np\n\nW (F). Let T1 \u0592\u2192 G\u0303Zp be an inclusion of reductive groups which over W (F) becomes the\ninclusion TW (F) \u0592\u2192 GW (F) and which is defined at the level of Lie algebras by\nLie(T1 ) := Lie TW (F)\n\n\u0001\u03c31\n\n\u0592\u2192 Lie GW (F)\n\n\u0001\u03c31\n\n=: Lie(G\u0303Zp )\n\n(the upper right index \u03c31 means we take the elements fixed by \u03c31 ). We get:\n\u0001\n\u2013 the Shimura \u03c3\u0304-crystals L\u2217p \u2297Zp W (F), \u03c31 \u03bcW (F) ( p1 ), T1 W (F) and L\u2217p \u2297Zp W (F),\n\u0001\n\u03c3\u03bc( p1 ) \u2297 1, GW (F) are both Shimura-ordinary, with the degree of definition equal to 2.\n\u0001\nBut the Newton polygon of L\u2217p \u2297Zp W (F), \u03c31 \u03bcW (F) ( p1 ), T1 W (F) is different from\n\u0001\nthe Newton polygon of L\u2217p \u2297Zp W (F), \u03c3\u03bc( p1 ) \u2297 1, G1 W (F) . Argument (cf. 3.9.2 and\n\u0001\n3.1.0 a)): the Lie stable p-ranks of L\u2217p \u2297Zp W (F), \u03c3\u03bc( p1 ) \u2297 1, GW (F) and of L\u2217p \u2297Zp\n\u0001\nW (F), \u03c31 \u03bcW (F) ( p1 ), GW (F) are different, the second one being 0.\n4.11.6.1. Remark. Always i1 takes G-ordinary points into toric points, cf.\n4.5.11.2.1. It is quite common, even if k(v) 6= k(v1 ), that i1 takes G-ordinary points\ninto U -ordinary points; see \u00a76 for examples.\n525\n\n\f4.11.7. Example. We assume that, as in 4.3.1, we have a product decomposition\n= \u00d7i\u2208H G1i indexed by the same set H as for G. We also assume that the image of\nLie(Gi ) in Lie(Gad\n1Zp ) lies in the direct summand Lie(G1i ). As in 4.3.1.1 we define, for i \u2208\nnc\nH , the i-th A-degree d1A (i) of definition of (f1 , L(p) , v1 ). We can have k(v ad ) = k(v1ad ),\nwithout having dA (i) = d1A (i), \u2200i \u2208 Hnc ; easy examples can be obtained with (Gad , X ad )\nad\na simple, adjoint Shimura pair of DnH type with non-trivial involution and with (Gad\n1 , X1 )\na simple, adjoint Shimura pair of A2n type. We have the following general result:\nGad\n1Zp\n\nFact. If there is i \u2208 Hnc such that dA (i) 6= d1A (i), then a G-ordinary point of Nk(v)\nis not mapped by i1 into a G1 -ordinary point of N1 k(v1 ) .\nThis is implied by the cyclic diagonalizability part of b) of 4.4.1 3) and by 4.4.13.3.\n4.11.8. Exercise. We assume that k = k\u0304, that i1 takes G-ordinary points of\nNk(v) into G1 -ordinary points of N1k(v1 ) , that neither G nor G1 are tori and that the\nA-degree of definition of a (any) G1 -canonical lift Spec(W (F)) \u2192 N1 is 1. Show that:\nif y : Spec(k) \u2192 Nk(v) is a G-ordinary point, then the formal torus (of the moduli\nformal scheme) of G-deformations of (Ay , pAy ) is a subtorus of the formal torus of G1 deformation of (Ay , pAy ); here we use the language and notations of 4.7.0 and 4.7.14.\nHint: use 4.11.2, 4.7.17 and 4.7.11 4).\nThis is a generalization, in the case of an arbitrary SHS whose A-degree of definition\nis 1, of the main result of [No1]. There are variants (cf. 4.7.11 8)) of this exercise for an\narbitrary A-degree of definition; warning: we do not know yet how useful they are (as\nthey are not a priori canonical).\n4.12. Integral and generalized Manin problems and applications. Let e \u2208 N\nand let p be a rational prime. Let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic p.\nThe (original) Manin problem asked for the proof of the predicted classification of\nisocrystals over k attached to (principally polarized) abelian varieties over k of dimension\ne. This problem was positively solved by the Honda\u2013Serre\u2013Tate's theory (cf. [Ta, p. 98]\nand [Mu, cor. 1 of p. 234]). For a second, more recent proof, see [Oo2]; see also 4.12.12.4.\n4.12.0. Overview of 4.12. The main goal of this section is to formulate (and\nsolve in some cases: see 4.12.4, the proof of 4.12.12, and 4.12.13 2) and 3); see \u00a711 for the\ngeneral case) different integral Manin problems for (special fibres of) integral canonical\nmodels of Shimura varieties of preabelian type w.r.t. primes dividing an odd rational\nprime. For the solution of these integral problems in the cases in which we know the\ncompletion property, we rely heavily on 3.6.15 A and 4.4.1.\nIt turns out that the combination of the proof of 4.12.12 (we have in mind its application 4.12.12.6) with 3.9.7.2 and with a refinement of 4.3.6, implies the strong form of the\ngeneralized Manin problem for the integral canonical models of 4.9.8 (see 4.12.12.6.4; see\n4.12.12.6.3.4 for the abstract extension to the generalized Shimura context); it is one of\nthe main four ingredients needed to solve all these integral Manin problems (see 4.12.12.7\ni) to iv)).\n526\n\n\fThough we first treat the case p \u2265 3, as a roundabout we show that (see 4.12.12.1\nand 4.14.3 J below) the same ideas apply for p = 2.\nThese integral Manin problems have many applications: below we include relatively\nfew of them; see \u00a79-14 for many more.\nFrom now on, except for a special reference, p \u2265 3.\n4.12.1. The integral Manin problem for Siegel modular varieties. Determine all isomorphism classes of principally quasi-polarized \u03c3k -crystals attached to\nprincipally polarized abelian varieties over k of dimension e.\n4.12.2. The integral Manin problem for a SHS (f, L(p) , v). Determine all\nisomorphism classes of principally quasi-polarized Shimura \u03c3k -crystals and of Shimura\nLie \u03c3k -crystals over k attached to k-valued points of Nk(v) .\n4.12.3. The integral Manin problem for a Shimura quadruple (G, X, H, v)\nof preabelian type, with v dividing a rational prime p \u2265 3. Determine all isomorphism classes of Shimura adjoint Lie \u03c3k -crystals attached (cf. 4.9.17) to k-valued points\nof the special fibre Nk(v) of the integral canonical model N of the quadruple (G, X, H, v).\n4.12.4. Solution of 4.12.1. Let (GSp(W, \u03c8), S) define a Siegel modular variety,\nwith dimQ (W ) = 2e. Let L(p) be a Z(p) -lattice of W such that \u03c8 : L(p) \u2297Z(p) L(p) \u2192 Z(p) is\na perfect form. We get a SHS (1(GSp(W,\u03c8),S) , L(p) , p). Let {wi |i \u2208 S(1, 2e)} be a Z(p) -basis\nof L\u2217(p) such that for i, j \u2208 S(1, 2e) satisfying j \u2265 i, \u03c8\u0303(wi , wj ) is equal to 1 if j \u2212 i = e\nand is equal to 0 otherwise. Let M0 := L\u2217(p) \u2297Z(p) W (k) and let F 1 \u2282 M0 be the W (k)submodule of M0 generated by wi , i \u2208 S(1, e). Let \u03c6 be the \u03c3k -linear endomorphism of\nM0 defined by: \u03c6(wi ) = pwi , if i \u2208 S(1, e), and \u03c6(wi ) = wi , if i \u2208 S(e + 1, 2e). We have:\nAnswer: The set Se (k) of isomorphism classes of \u03c3k -crystals attached to principally\npolarized abelian varieties over k of dimension e is precisely the set of isomorphism classes\nof principally quasi-polarized \u03c3k -crystals defined by elements of the set\n{(M0 , g\u03c6, \u03c8\u0303)|g \u2208 Sp(M0 , \u03c8\u0303)(W (k))}.\nTo argue this answer, we recall the following obvious isogeny property:\nThe isogeny property. If (M0\u2032 , g\u03c6, \u03c8\u0303), with M0\u2032 a W (k)-lattice of M0 [ p1 ], is the\nprincipally quasi-polarized \u03c3k -crystal attached to a principally polarized abelian variety\n(A\u2032 , pA\u2032 ) over k, then there is a principally polarized abelian variety (A, pA ) over k, Z[ p1 ]isogeneous to (A\u2032 , pA\u2032 ) and of whose associated principally quasi-polarized \u03c3k -crystal, under this Z[ p1 ]-isogeny, is identifiable with (M0 , g\u03c6, \u03c8\u0303).\nFrom [Ta, p. 98] and [Mu, cor. 1 of p. 234] we deduce the existence of an abelian variety \u00c3 over k whose attached isocrystal is (M0 [ p1 ], g\u03c6) and which has a principal polarization p\u0303\u00c3 . But for any two principal quasi-polarizations \u03c81 and \u03c82 of (M0 [ p1 ], g\u03c6), the triples\n(M0 [ p1 ], g\u03c6, \u03c81) and (M0 [ p1 ], g\u03c6, \u03c82) are isomorphic. Argument: using Dieudonn\u00e9's classification of isocrystals and duals, the situation gets reduced to the case when (M0 [ p1 ], g\u03c6)\n527\n\n\fis of pure slope 12 ; in such a case, using the standard argument which shows that any two\nnon-degenerate alternating forms on an even dimensional B(k)-vector space are isomorphic, we can write (M0 [ p1 ], g\u03c6, \u03c81) as a direct sum of principally quasi-polarized isocrystals\nof rank 2 (for them the statement is trivial). So we can assume \u03c8\u0303 is defined by p\u0303A . So\nthe above answer follows from the mentioned isogeny property.\nIf we assume 3.6.15 A, then the answers to 4.12.2-3 are provided by 4.4.1 as follows.\n4.12.5. Solution of 4.12.2 in the case N has the completion property. Let\nM0 := M \u2297W (k(v)) W (k), F01 := F 1 \u2297W (k(v)) W (k) and let \u03c60 := \u03c6 \u2297 1 be the Frobenius\nendomorphism of M0 , where M , F 1 and \u03c6 have the same significance as in 4.1. Using\n4.1.6, we have:\nAnswer*: The set S(f,L(p) ,v) (k) of isomorphism classes of principally quasi-polarized\nShimura \u03c3k -crystals attached to k-valued points of N is precisely the set of isomorphism\nclasses of principally quasi-polarized Shimura \u03c3k -crystals defined by elements of the set\n{(M0 , g\u03c60 , GW (k) , (v\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J \u2032 , \u03c8\u0303)|g \u2208 G0W (k) (W (k))}.\nAnswer: The set Lie(S(f,L(p) ,v) )(k) of isomorphism classes of Shimura Lie \u03c3k crystals attached to k-valued points of N is precisely the set defined by elements of the\nset {(Lie(GW (k) ), g\u03c60 )|g \u2208 G0W (k) (W (k))}.\nThe proofs of these two answers are a direct consequence of 3.6.15 A and of d) of\n4.4.1 3) (resp. and of c) of 4.4.1 2)) for the first answer (resp. for the second one),\ncf. also 4.4.12. As we postponed the proof of d) of 4.4.1 3), we invite the reader to\nformulate a version of the first answer, inspired from 3.6.15 A, for k-valued points of a\nfixed connected component C of Nk (in fact 4.2.8.1 takes care of all connected components\nof Nk at once); we can also use 4.4.7 and 2.3.13.1: we get the above starred answer (for\nC) but with (M, F 1 , \u03c6, GW (k(v)) , (v\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J \u2032 ) replaced by another Shimura-canonical lift of\na Shimura-ordinary \u03c3k -crystal with an emphasized family of tensors indexed by J \u2032 (so\nwe do not know a priori that it is 1J \u2032 -isomorphic to (M, F 1 , \u03c6, GW (k(v)) , (v\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J \u2032 )).\n4.12.6. Solution of 4.12.3 in the case the integral canonical model N ad\nof the adjoint quadruple of (G, X, H, v) has the completion property. We refer\nto 4.9.17.4 for terminology. Let GZ(p) be the reductive group over Z(p) whose generic\nfibre is G and whose group of Z(p) -valued points is H, cf. [Ti2, 3.4.1] and [Va2, 3.1.3].\nLet v ad be the prime of E(Gad , X ad ) divided by v. Let \u03bcad : Gm \u2192 Gad\nW (k(v ad )) be a\nad\nad\ncocharacter which under an O(v ad ) -monomorphism W (k(v )) \u0592\u2192 C, is G (C)-conjugate\nad\nto the cocharacters \u03bcx : Gm \u0592\u2192 Gad\nC , with x \u2208 X , defined in [Va2, 2.2]. We have:\nAnswer: The set S(G,X,H,v) (k) of isomorphism classes of Shimura adjoint Lie \u03c3k crystals attached to k-valued points of N is precisely the set of isomorphism classes of\nShimura adjoint Lie \u03c3k -crystals defined by elements of the set\nad 1\nad\n{(Lie(Gad\nW (k) ), g(\u03c3\u03bc ( ) \u2297 1)|g \u2208 GW (k) (W (k))}.\np\n\n528\n\n\fad\nad 1\nTo argue this, we consider a SHS (f1 , L1(p) , v1 ) such that (Gad\n1 , X1 , H1 , v1 ) =\n(Gad , X ad , H ad , v ad ), cf. [Va2, 6.4.2] and 2.3.6 (for p = 3 cf. \u00a76). The connected compop\nad\nad\nnents of NW\n(F) are permuted by G (Af ), cf. [Va2, 3.3.2]. So the answer follows from\n4.9.17.4 and b) of 4.4.1 2), once we remark that each connected component of NW (F) is\nad\nnaturally a pro-\u00e9tale cover of a connected component of NW\n(F) (cf. [Va2, 6.4.5.1]).\n\n4.12.6.1. Fact. N ad has the completion property, provided 3.6.15 A is true for\na standard Hodge situation, involving a Shimura quadruple having the same adjoint as\n(G, X, H, v).\nProof: We first assume Gad is a Q\u2013simple, adjoint group. Let o(Gad ) be the order\nof the center of the simply connected group cover of Gad\nC . The proof of the Fact in the\ncase when p 6 |o(Gad ) is a direct consequence of 4.9.17 and of b) of 4.4.1 2): if p 6 |o(Gad )\nad\nthen the natural homomorphism Gder\nW (k) (W (k)) \u2192 GW (k) (W (k)) is surjective.\nAs we assumed p \u2265 3, p divides o(Gad ) only in the case when (Gad , X ad ) is of\nAl Lie type, with p dividing l + 1. But in such a case there is an injective map\nad\nad\nad\nder\nf : (G1 , X1 ) \u0592\u2192 (GSp(W, \u03c8), S), with (Gad\na simply\n1 , X1 ) = (G , X ) and with G1\nconnected, semisimple group, such that we have a standard PEL situation (f, L(p) , v1 , B),\nwith v1 dividing v ad and with the homomorphism G1 W (k) (W (k)) \u2192 Gad\nW (k) (W (k)) surjective, cf. 2.3.5.1. The surjectivity part results from the fact that for any simple factor\nof Gad\nW (k) there is a general linear group over W (k) which is included in G1 W (k) and\nwhich has the given factor as its adjoint group, cf. 2.3.5.1 and [Ko2, (A) of p. 395]. The\ncompletion property in the context of N1 is stated (see 3.6.15 A) in terms of elements of\nG01W (k) (W (k)); but from the proof of 2.3.16 we deduce that provided we ignore the principal quasi-polarizations, it can be stated as well in terms of elements of G1W (k) (W (k)).\nSo, again directly from def. 4.9.17 we get the validity of the above statement in this\ncase, provided N1 has the completion property. This proves the weaker form of the Fact\nobtained by replacing \"for a standard Hodge situation\" by \"for a certain standard Hodge\nsituation\" (it is [Va2, 6.5.1] and 2.3.5.2 which allow us to eliminate the assumption that\nGad is Q\u2013simple).\nWe now prove the Fact in its general form, without making any distinction on how\np is and without assuming Gad is Q\u2013simple. Let T\u0303 be the image of T of 4.1 in Gad\nZp . We\nhave (cf. (DER) of 2.2.6 1); see 4.2.7 for the def. of mqu )\nGad\nW (F) (W (k)) = mqu W (k) (GW (F) (W (k))))T\u0303 (W (k)).\nFrom this and the adjoint variant 3.11.7 of 3.11.1 c) (see also 3.5.5) we get (the notations\nare as of 4.12.6):\nad 1\nSubfact. Any Shimura adjoint Lie \u03c3k -crystal (Lie(Gad\nW (k) ), g(\u03c3\u03bc ( p ) \u2297 1)), with\n1\nad\n1\nad 1\ng \u2208 Gad\nW (k) (W (k)), is inner isomorphic to (Lie(GW (k) ), g (\u03c3\u03bc ( p ) \u2297 1)) for some g \u2208\nGder\nW (k) (W (k)).\n\nFrom this Subfact the Fact follows.\n529\n\n\f4.12.7. The Manin problem for a SHS (f, L(p) , v). Classify all principally\nquasi-polarized Shimura isocrystals (resp. all Shimura adjoint Lie isocrystals) over k\ndefined by principally quasi-polarized Shimura \u03c3k -crystals (resp. by Shimura adjoint Lie\n\u03c3k -crystals) attached to k-valued points of N .\n4.12.8.

Classify all adjoint Lie\nisocrystals over k defined by Shimura adjoint Lie \u03c3k -crystals attached to k-valued points\nof the integral canonical model of (G, X, H, v).\n4.12.9. Remarks. 1) To our knowledge the result (answer) of 4.12.4 has not been\nstated as such for Siegel modular varieties of dimension greater than 3. It says:\nFact. Any principally quasi-polarized \u03c3k -crystal (i.e. any principally quasi-polarized\np-divisible group) over k, is associated to a principally polarized abelian variety over k,\nand any principally quasi-polarized filtered \u03c3k -crystal (i.e. any principally quasi-polarized\np-divisible group over W (k)), is associated to a principally polarized abelian scheme over\nW (k).\n2) 4.12.5-6 form implicitly a solution of the problems 4.12.7-8, provided we assume\nthe completion property. But it is very much desirable, to have a more concrete (and\nfinite) answer to 4.12.7-8, similar to the answer of the (original) Manin problem in terms\nof formal isogeny types. From numerical point of view, we will deal with this in \u00a710 (see\n4.12.10 below for a sample); from the point of view of toric points, solutions of 4.12.7-8\ncan be obtained starting from 4.12.12.6.4 below.\n4.12.10. Example. Let n \u2265 m be natural numbers and let l := m + n. Let\n= SU (n, m)R , Gder\n(f, L(p) , v) be a SHS such that Gder\nZp = SL(N ), with N a free Zp R\nmodule of rank l, and N has the completion property. Then the set of isomorphism\nclasses of Shimura adjoint Lie isocrystals over k defined by Shimura adjoint Lie \u03c3k -crystals\nattached to k-valued points of N , is the set obtained by taking sl(\u2217) of isomorphism\nclasses (\u2217) of isocrystals (I, \u03c6I ) over k having only slopes which are rational numbers of\nthe interval [0, 1], whose total sum (involving multiplicities) is m, and with I a free B(k)vector space of dimension l. This is a consequence of 4.12.6 and of Subfact of 4.12.6.1\n(cf. also 4.9.17).\nFor more examples see \u00a710 and [Va4].\n4.12.11. Problems. 1) Let (G, X, H, v) be a Shimura quadruple of preabelian\ntype, with v dividing a rational prime p \u2265 3. Let k1 (v) be a finite field extension of k(v)\nand let H0 be a compact, open subgroup of G(Apf ) as in 4.9.20. Let \u03c31 be the Frobenius\nautomorphism of W (k1 (v)). Determine all Shimura adjoint Lie \u03c31 -crystals over k1 (v)\nattached (see 4.9.20) to k1 (v)-valued points of N /H0 , where N is the integral canonical\nmodel of the quadruple (G, X, H, v). In particular, determine conditions on H0 and k1 (v),\nwhich assures N /H0 (k1 (v)) is not empty.\n2) For a fixed subgroup H0 of G(Apf ) as in 1), determine the smallest algebraic field\nextension k1 (v) of k(v) with the property that any isomorphism class of Shimura adjoint\n530\n\n\fLie \u03c3\u0304-crystals (resp. isocrystals) over F attached to F-valued points of N , is defined (by\nextension to F and by inverting p) by a Shimura adjoint Lie \u03c31 -crystal (resp. isocrystal)\nattached to a k1 (v)-valued point of N /H0 .\n3) The same problems 1) and 2) but for a SHS (f, L(p) , v) (in this case the reference\nto 4.9.20 can be substituted by 2.3.10).\n4.12.11.1. Remark. If there is a SHS (f, L(p) , v), with H = G(L(p) \u2297Z(p) Zp ), and\nif either all Hodge cycles of A are as well Hodge cycles of AH0 or k1 (v) is big enough\nand we have restrictions on the Lie types of the simple factors of Gad similar in nature to\nthe ones of 2.3.9, then in \u00a714 we will see that the answer to problem 4.12.11 1) is of the\nsame form as the one given in 4.12.6\nbut with k replaced by k1 (v) and with g running\n\u0001\nthrough a subset G k1 (v), N /H0 of Gad\nW (k1 (v)) (W (k1 (v))). Also in \u00a714 we will deal with\nthe problem of determining this subset and of what can be said when no assumption on\nH0 is made.\n4.12.12. Theorem. Any p-divisible group D over k has a uni plus versal deformation (to a p-divisible group) over a smooth, affine W (k)-scheme MD .\nProof: Let (M, \u03c6) be the \u03c3k -crystal defined by D and let (M, F 1 , \u03c6) be the filtered\n\u03c3k -crystal associated to an arbitrary lift of D to a p-divisible group over W (k). If F 1\nis not a proper summand of M we can take MD = Spec(W (k)). So we can assume\nwe have a Shimura filtered \u03c3k -crystal (M, F 1 , \u03c6, GL(M )). Let a := dimW (k) (F 1 ) and\nb := dimW (k) (M/F 1 ). We have ab 6= 0. We can assume \u03c6 = g\u03c60 , with g \u2208 SL(M )(W (k))\nand with \u03c60 a Frobenius endomorphism of M such that (M, F 1 , \u03c60 , GL(M )) is a GL(M )canonical lift. So F 1 is left invariant by \u03c60 and the slopes of the isocrystal defined by\n(M, \u03c60 ) are 0 and 1 with multiplicities b and respectively a. If ab = 1, then D is the\np-divisible group of an elliptic curve and so the Theorem is well known. We assume now\nthat ab \u2265 2.\nWe consider a SHS (f, L(p) , v) such that:\na) Gder\nR is SU (a, b)R ;\na+b\nb) G splits over Qp ; so k(v) = Fp and Gder\nZp = SL(Zp );\n\nc) there is a torus T of G of dimension 0 or 1 depending on the fact that a is or is\nnot equal to be b, such that TR is compact and the monomorphisms ResC/R Gm \u2192 GR\ndefining elements of X factor through G1R , where G1 is the subgroup of G generated by\nGder , by T and by the 1 dimensional split torus of scalar automorphisms of W ;\nd) E(G, X) is Q or a totally imaginary quadratic extension of Q depending on the\nfact that a is or is not equal to b;\ne) there is m \u2208 N such that the representation GZp \u2192 GL(L\u2217(p) \u2297Z(p) Zp ) is a\ndirect sum of 2m irreducible representations \u03c11 , \u03c12 ,..., \u03c12m such that the restriction of\n\u03c1i to Gder\nZp is the representation associated to the minimal weight \u03c9\u03041 (resp. \u03c9\u0304a+b\u22121 ) if\ni \u2208 S(1, m) (resp. if i \u2208 S(m+1, 2m)): here we use the standard notations for weights (see\n[Bou2, planche I]); in other words, we have a direct sum decomposition as GZp -modules\n531\n\n\fi\ni\na+b\nder\na+b\nL\u2217(p) \u2297Z(p) Zp = \u22952m\ni=1 L , with L = Zp , such that A \u2208 GZp (Zp ) = SL(Zp )(Zp ) acts\nas A on L1 ,..., Lm and as the inverse of the transpose of A on Lm+1 ,..., L2m ;\n\ne') moreover, \u03c1i is the dual of \u03c1i+m w.r.t. \u03c8, i.e., for i, j \u2208 S(1, 2m), with |j \u2212 i| =\n6 m,\nj\nL is perpendicular on L w.r.t. \u03c8;\ni\n\nf ) (G, X) is of compact type.\nArgument. The existence of such a SHS is just a particular case of 2.3.5.1: in\nfact we get a standard PEL situation (f, L(p) , v, B), with B as the Z(p) -subalgebra of\nEnd(L(p) ) formed by endomorphisms fixed by GZ(p) . We just have to remark a couple\nof things. To explain them, we start with an arbitrary adjoint Shimura pair (G0 , X0 ) of\ncompact type such that G0 splits over Qp and G0R is SU (a, b)ad\nR . It can be constructed\nas follows. Let l be a prime different from p and let K1 be a totally imaginary quadratic\nextension of Q splitting at p and l. Let (G1 , X 1 ) be a Shimura pair constructed as in\n[Go] starting from a non-degenerate hermitian form on a K1 -vector space V of dimension\na + b which has signature (a, b) over R (i.e. when extended to V \u2297Q R). G1 splits over Qp\nand over Ql . We twist G1ad by an inner form, corresponding to a central division algebra\nover Q of dimension (a + b)2 which splits at p and at \u221e and which is ramified at l: we\nget G0 . G0 splits over Qp , has rank 0 over Ql (for instance, cf. [Bo2, 23.1]), and so over\n1ad\n.\nQ; moreover, as G0R = G1ad\nR , we get a Shimura pair (G0 , X0 ), with X0 := X\nThe reflex field E(G0 , X0 ) is Q if a = b and a totally imaginary quadratic extension\nK0 of Q splitting above p if a 6= b (cf. [De2, 2.3.6] and the fact that G0 is absolutely\nsimple). We apply 2.3.5.1 to (G0 , X0 ): we get a standard PEL situation (f, L(p) , v, B),\nwith f : (G, X) \u0592\u2192 (GSp(W, \u03c8), S) an injective map for which we have (Gad , X ad ) =\n(G0 , X0 ). This takes care of a) and f) (cf. [BHC] for the f) part). As 2.3.5.1 is just a\nrestatement of [Va2, 6.5.1.1 and Case 2 of 6.6.5.1] (which refers to the case p = 3 as well),\nwe just need to point that we can arrange the things so that b), c), d), e) and e') hold as\nwell. In loc. cit. we considered a totally imaginary quadratic extension of Q: we take it\nto split above p and in case a 6= b (in order to get c)) we need it to be K0 .\nWe first treat the case a = b. In this case c) and d) follow from [De2, 2.3.13]:\nthe centralizer C1 in GSp(L(p) , \u03c8) of the Zariski closure G1Z(p) of G1 in GL(L(p) ) is a\nreductive group over Z(p) which splits over Zp (we need to choose \u03c8\u0303 in [Va2, 6.5.1.1 v)]\nin the similar way to the one mentioned in [Va2, Case 2 of 6.6.5.1], so that e') and e)\nhold mod p); so we take G to be generated by G1 and (cf. [Har, 5.5.3]) by the generic\nfibre of a maximal torus of C1 which splits over Zp (as in the proof of Lemma 2 of 4.6.4\nwe argue that GZp is reductive). So GZp is split and so b) follows. As GZp is split, e) and\ne') follow directly from their mod p versions.\nFrom now on, till the end of the argument, we assume a 6= b. d) is a consequence\nof [Va2, 6.5.1.1 c)]: the Q\u2013algebra KS of the proof of [De2, 2.3.10] and used in [Va2,\n6.5.1.1 and Case 2 of 6.6.5.1] is K0 itself; so, cf. [De1, 2.3.9], E(Gab , X ab ) = K0 and\nso E(G, X) = K0 . c) follows from [Va2, 6.5.1.1 iv)]: we take T to be the subtorus of\ndimension 1 of the torus defined by invertible elements of KS \u2297Q K0 which over R is\ncompact and c) holds (the fact that we can take T to be of dimension 1 and not 2 is\n532\n\n\fimplied by our choice KS = K0 ); obviously G1 splits over Qp . To get b) and e), we just\nhave to take G to be defined as above, via C1 . This ends the argument of the existence\nof a SHS subject to the requirements a) to f).\nThe completion property. We assume H0 is small enough so that all Hodge cycles\nof A are Hodge cycles of AH0 as well. So B \u2297Z(p) Zp acts on the p-divisible group of the\nextension of AH0 to NW (k) /H0 . We deduce (cf. e)) that this p-divisible group is a direct\nsum of 2m p-divisible groups D1 ,..., D2m of rank a + b: Di \"corresponds\" to Li . Each\none of them is a uni plus versal deformation in each k-valued point of NW (k) /H0 and has\ndimension a or b; moreover, \u2200i \u2208 S(1, m), Dit is Di+m (cf. e')). We can assume D1 has\ndimension a in each k-valued point of NW (k) /H0 .\nLet f1 be the restriction of f to G1 . The triple (f1 , L(p) , v) is as well a SHS (the\nargument is the same as the one of b) of Fact 1 of 2.3.5.2). Let N1 be the integral\ncanonical model associated to it.\nWe start checking that N has the completion property. N1 is naturally an open\nclosed subscheme of N (cf. [Va2, 3.2.15]). From this, [Va2, 3.3.2], and the fact (see\n2.3.3.1) that N /H0 is a projective O(v) -scheme we get: it is enough to check that N1 has\nthe completion property. So based on e) and e') we can treat the situation as if m = 1:\nthe representation of G1Zp on L1 ,..., Lm are isomorphic, cf. above constructions (this can\nbe checked over C and so we just have to trace KS and K0 in the proof of [De2, 2.3.10]).\nAccordingly, in what follows, not to complicate the notations we keep in mind that we\ncan treat situation as if m = 1 but we still deal with the checking that N itself has the\ncompletion property. We follow the ideas of 4.12.4. First, the analogous isogeny property\ncan be easily checked in this context. With the notations of 4.12.4, we obviously have:\nThe isogeny property for (f, L(p) , v, B). We assume we have a triple (A\u2032 , pA\u2032 , B)\nwhich is obtained from (A, PA ) and its natural family of Z(p) -endomorphisms (still denoted by B) by pull back via a k-valued point y \u2032 of N . If any invertible element of B,\nwhen viewed naturally (via de Rham components) as an automorphism of M0\u2032 , is also an\nautomorphism of M0 , then all these elements (assumed to be de Rham components of\nZ(p) -automorphisms of A) are de Rham components of Z(p) -automorphisms of A.\nWe consider a lift (AW (k) , pAW (k) , B) to W (k) of the triple (A, pA , B) we get (its\nexistence is argued using Grothendieck\u2013Messing's theory of [Me, ch. 4-5] and standard arguments on representations of products of matrix W (k)-algebras; see also [Va2,\n4.3.11], AE.1 and e) of Exercise of 2.3.18 B3). For s \u2208 N, with (s, p) = 1, we endow\n(AW (k) , pAW (k) ) with the level-s symplectic similitude structure obtained naturally from\nthe one (see 2.3.2) of (A\u2032 , pA\u2032 ) via the mentioned Z[ p1 ]-isogeny. The fact that the triple\n(AW (k) , pAW (k) , B) together with the mentioned level-s symplectic similitude structures is\nobtained from (A, PA , B) and its natural level-s symplectic similitude structures by pull\nback through a W (k)-valued point of N , is a consequence of the following four things:\n\u2013 the Hasse principle holds for G even if a + b is even, see the first two paragraphs of\n[Ko2, ch. 7] (referring to the notations of loc. cit., in our case F0 = Q and so D = F \u00d7 ;\nour K0 is nothing else but F of loc. cit.);\n533\n\n\f1\n1\n\u2013 the triples (Hcrys\n(A\u2032 /W (k)), pA\u2032 , B) and (Hcrys\n(A/W (k)), pA, B) are isomorphic\n(this is just the simplest case of the equivalent for p of b) of 2.3.18 B3); so (cf. also\n4.6.8 and Lang's theorem) the triples (see 2.3.1 and 4.1 for the first one) (L,p \u03c8\u0303, B) and\n1\n(H\u00e9t\n(AB(k) , Zp ), pAW (k) , B) are isomorphic: this takes care of the Qp -context;\n\n\u2013 [Ko2, 4.3] takes care of the R-context;\n\u2013 the choice of the level-s symplectic similitude structures takes care of the Ql context, for any prime l different from p.\nConclusion: the triple (A, pA , B) is as well obtained from (A, PA , B) by pull back via\na k-valued point y of N .\nDieudonn\u00e9's classification of isocrystals over k implies that any isocrystal over k of\na p-divisible group E is isomorphic to the isocrystal of a cyclic diagonalizable filtered\n\u03c3k -crystal over k whose F 1 -filtration has the same rank as the dimension of E. So, from\nthis and from the above isogeny property, as we can treat the situation as if m = 1,\nwe get: to show that N has the completion property, we just need to check that for\nany cyclic diagonalizable Shimura \u03c3k -crystal CN = (N, FN1 , \u03c6N , GL(N )), with N a free\nW (k)-module of rank a + b and with FN1 a direct summand of it of rank a, there is a k\u2217\nvalued yN point of NW (k) /H0 such that the Shimura \u03c3k -crystal of yN\n(D1 ) (see 2.2.9 9)),\nis isomorphic to (N, \u03c6N , GL(N )). It is 2.3.17, which allows us to pass on to a Shimura\nfiltered context: there is a W (k)-valued point zN of N lifting yN and such that the\n\u2217\nShimura filtered \u03c3k -crystal of zN\n(D1 ) is isomorphic to (N, FN1 , \u03c6N , GL(N )).\nLet TN be a maximal torus of GL(N ) such that (N, FN1 , \u03c6N , TN ) is a Shimura \u03c3k crystal (cf. 2.2.16). We consider the Galois representation associated to it; it can be\nviewed as a homomorphism\n\u03c1N : \u0393k \u2192 T\u0303N (Zp ),\nwhere T\u0303N is a suitable maximal torus of the image GL1 of GZp in the GL-group GL1\nof the first Zpa+b -summand L1 of L\u2217(p) \u2297Z(p) Zp . T\u0303NW (F) is naturally equipped with a\ncocharacter \u03bcN : identifying TN with T\u0303NW (k) (cf. 2.2.16.2.1), it is the cocharacter defining\nthe canonical split of (N, FN1 , \u03c6N , TN ); it acts trivially on a W (k)-submodule of L1 \u2297Zp\nW (k) of rank b. Let (cf. [Har, 5.5.3]) T0 be a maximal Z(p) -torus of G1Z(p) such that:\ng) over R it is the extension of a compact torus by a 1 dimensional split torus;\nh) its extension to Zp has an image T1 in GL1 which is GL1 (Zp )-conjugate to T\u0303N .\nLet g \u2208 GL1 (Zp ) be such that gTN g \u22121 = T1 . We consider a cocharacter\n\u03bc(T0 ) : Gm \u2192 T0C\nsuch that:\ni) viewed as a cocharacter of GC it is G(C)-conjugate to cocharacters \u03bcx , x \u2208 X;\nj) viewing T1C as a quotient of T0C , its natural cocharacter defined by \u03bc(T0 ) is\nobtained from the cocharacter g\u03bcN g \u22121 of T1W (F) by extension of scalars (under an O(v) monomorphism W (F) \u0592\u2192 C).\n534\n\n\f\u03bc(T0 ) is uniquely determined: if a = b then T1 = T0Zp ; if a 6= b then this is a\nconsequence of the structure of G1Zp (it is naturally isomorphic to GL1 \u00d7 Gm ).\nAs T0 is the extension of a 1 dimensional split torus by a torus which is compact\nover R, from i) we deduce that the image of \u03bc(T0 ) is defined over R. We consider the\nsubgroup of T0R generated by this image and by the split subtorus of T0R . It is nothing\nelse but ResC/R Gm , cf. i). So we get naturally a monomorphism\nh0 : ResC/R Gm \u0592\u2192 T0 R .\nFrom [De2, 1.2.8] (see also the general result of [Ko2, 4.3]) we get: the G(R)-conjugacy\nclass of h0 (viewed as a cocharacter of GR ) is X itself; in fact the map\nad\n(G1 , X1 ) \u2192 (Gad , X ad ) = (Gad\n1 , X1 )\n\nis a cover (cf. its construction; the kernel of G1 \u2192 Gad\n1 is ResK0 /Q Gm ) and so X1 = X =\nad\nX (see [Mi1, 4.11]). We deduce the existence of a special quadruple (see [Va2, 3.2.10])\n(T0 Q , {h0 }, T0 (Zp ), vp ) \u0592\u2192 (G, X, H, v),\nwith vp a prime of E(T0 , {h0 }) dividing v, which has the property that the cocharacter\nof T0 W (k(vp )) we naturally get (as in 4.1) is modeled on \u03bcN (i.e. its extension to C via\nan inclusion W (k(vp )) \u2282 C extending the natural inclusion O(vp ) \u2282 C, is \u03bc(T0 ) itself).\nNow we can easily check (cf. 4.1.1 and 4.2.3.1) that any k-valued point of NW (k) /H0\nfactoring through the integral canonical model of this special quadruple, can be chosen\nas the desired k-valued point yN . We conclude: N (and so \u2013as we can treat the situation\nas if n = 1\u2013 also N1 ) has the completion property.\nSo there is y \u2208 NW (k) /H0 such that y \u2217 (D1 ) is isomorphic to D (cf. 4.12.5); as\nk(v) = Fp , to get 4.12.5 for our SHS's (f, L(p) , v) and (f1 , L(p) , v) we can refer to 4.6.5\ninstead of d) of 4.4.1 3. This ends the proof.\n4.12.12.0. Variants and comments. If we do not require 4.12.12 f) to hold, we\ncan take m = 1, i.e. we can work out the things in the context of (G1 , X 1 ) itself, without\nperforming any inner twist.\nWhat was important in 4.12.12? Answer: that over Zp we get a \"right\" direct sum\ndecomposition of L\u2217(p) \u2297Z(p) Zp into irreducible GZp -representations so that we can \"single\nout\" a p-divisible group D1 as above which is \"related to\" D. In fact we do not need\na direct sum decomposition: we just need an adequate irreducible subrepresentation;\nhowever, if we do have such a \"right\" direct sum decomposition of L\u2217(p) \u2297Z(p) Zp , then it\nis much easier to check that an isogeny property (analogue to the of 4.12.4) holds. So\n4.12.12 e) can be replaced by more general versions, inspired from [Va2, 6.5-6].\nIn future we will use the above paragraph to show that 4.12.12 remains true (under\nproper formulation) for any generalized Shimura p-divisible object (M0 , \u03c60 , G0 ) over k:\nfor the case when G0 together with its filtration class is related to Shimura varieties of\n535\n\n\fpreabelian type see \u00a77; for the case when the situation is related to Shimura varieties of\nspecial type see [Va6] (cf. also 3.15.6). Moreover it seems to us that the condition k = k\u0304\nis not (really) needed: in other words, (at least) in many situations it is enough to work\nwith a perfect field (as the combination of Theorem 2 of 3.15.1, 3.15.3 1) and 4.12.12\nsuggests).\n4.12.12.1. The case p = 2. The natural question arises: what about the case\np = 2? Defining the completion property for p = 2 as in 3.6.16 1) and 4.9.17.4, we have:\nAnswer: 4.12.4 remains true for p = 2. Also, 4.12.5 remains true for the case of a\np = 2 SHS (f, L(2) , v) whose integral canonical model N has the completion property.\nMoreover, the general case of the proof of the Fact of 4.12.6.1 involving a Subfact,\nholds as well for p = 2. The same proofs (for p \u2265 3) apply to get these results for p = 2.\nWe also have:\n4.12.12.2. Corollary. The result of 4.12.12 remains true for p = 2: any 2divisible group over an algebraically closed field k\u0303 of characteristic 2 has a uni plus versal\ndeformation (to a 2-divisible group) over a smooth, affine W (k\u0303)-scheme.\nProof: This is a consequence of 4.12.12 and 2.3.18. We just need to remark that\nwe can still define \u03c1N so that it can be used in the same manner, cf. the part of 2.3.18.2\nreferring to \"isolating aside\" the slopes 0 and 1 (in 4.14 A below it is pointed out that\nwe can still appeal to 4.1.1 and 4.2.3.1 for p = 2).\nSimilarly, the variant of 4.12.12 mentioned in 4.12.12.0 and involving m = 1, holds\nas well for p = 2. The surjectivity part of the Claim of 2.4.1 implies (cf. also 2.3.18.1 D)\nthat 4.12.9 1) holds for p = 2 (even for principally quasi-polarized filtered \u03c3k -crystals).\n4.12.12.3. Tate deformation Hopf algebras and Shimura p-divisible groups.\nLet k\u0303 be a perfect field of characteristic p \u2265 2. Let (M\u0303 , F\u0303 1 , \u03c6\u0303, G\u0303, (t\u0303\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J ) be the not necessary quasi-split Shimura filtered \u03c3k\u0303 -crystal associated to a Shimura p-divisible group D\u0303\nover W (k\u0303). Let d \u0303 := dd((M\u0303 , \u03c6\u0303, G\u0303)). Let R\u0303 be the p-adic completion of the henselization\nR\u0303(h) of the localization of W (k\u0303)[x1 , ..., xd \u0303] w.r.t. its prime ideal (x1 , ..., xd \u0303). There is (cf.\nTheorem 2 of 3.15.1) a uni plus versal Shimura p-divisible group Ddef (D\u0303) over Spec(R\u0303),\nwhich in a W (k\u0303)-valued point z\u0303 of Spec(R\u0303) is D\u0303. Warning: Ddef (D\u0303) is not uniquely\ndetermined; here uniqueness is up to automorphisms of Ddef (D\u0303) and of R\u0303.\nWe refer to Ddef (D\u0303) as a Tate deformation Shimura p-divisible group of D\u0303. Writing\nDdef [pn ] = Spec(Rn (D\u0303)), we refer to Rn (D\u0303) as a level-n Tate deformation Hopf algebra\nof D\u0303. We think it is an interesting (and extremely important) problem to study (classify)\nthese finite, flat, Hopf R\u0303-algebras.\nWe have a similar problem (much harder) to understand (classify) the similarly\ndefined Hopf R\u0303(h)-algebras (for this problem we assume that at least one such Ddef (D\u0303)\nis definable over R\u0303(h) itself).\n4.12.12.4. Exercise. Use the proof of 4.12.12 to get a proof of the original Manin\nproblem. Hint: using products of principally polarized abelian varieties, the problem gets\n536\n\n\freduced to the case when we are dealing with a Newton polygon N P having only the\na\n, with (a, b) = 1, a, b \u2208 N, b > a, we\nslopes \u03b1 and 1 \u2212 \u03b1, with \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 21 ); writing \u03b1 = a+b\ncan assume the multiplicities of \u03b1 and 1 \u2212 \u03b1 for N P are both a + b and so we can use\nthe SHS's mentioned in the proof of 4.12.12 (or in 4.12.12.0).\nIt is worth pointing out that this proof does not appeal to [Mu, cor. 1 of p. 234].\n4.12.12.5. Corollary. Let k1 be an algebraically closed field of arbitrary positive\ncharacteristic p. Let R1 be a complete, noetherian, local W (k1 )-algebra having k1 as its\nresidue field. Let D1 be a p-divisible group over Spec(R1 ). Then D1 is a direct summand\nof the p-divisible group of a principally polarized abelian scheme (A1 , pA1 ) over Spec(R1 )\nof dimension not greater than the rank of D1 .\nProof: If D1 is \u00e9tale or of multiplicative type, then we can take (A1 , pA1 ) to be the\npull back (via the morphism Spec(R1 ) \u2192 Spec(Zp )) of the canonical lift of an ordinary\nabelian variety over Fp which has a principal polarization and is of dimension equal to the\nrank of D1 . The other cases are a consequence of the part of 4.12.12.0 and of 4.12.12.2\nreferring to m = 1; so based on Serre\u2013Tate's deformation theory we can take (A1 , pA1 )\nsuch that:\na) its principally quasi-polarized p-divisible group is isomorphic to the direct sum of\nD1 and of its dual, together with its natural principal polarization;\nb) the projector which achieves the direct sum decomposition of a) is a Zp -linear\ncombination of endomorphisms of A1 which preserve this decomposition.\n4.12.12.6. The existence of toric points. The proof of 4.12.12 can be adapted\nto show the existence of \"as many types of toric points as expected\". Let (f, L(p) , v) be\na SHS. Let \u03c9 and C\u03c9 be as in 4.1.5. Let (G1 , X1 , H1 , v1 ) be a Shimura quadruple having\nthe same adjoint as (G, X, H, v). We have:\nCorollary. Any connected component C1 of the extension to W (F) of the integral\ncanonical model N1 of (G1 , X1 , H1 , v1 ) has F-valued points whose attached Shimura adjoint Lie \u03c3\u0304-crystals are isomorphic to the Shimura adjoint Lie \u03c3\u0304-crystal attached to C\u03c9 .\nProof: As the connected components of N1W (F) are permuted transitively by G1 (Apf )\n(see [Va2, 3.3.2]), based on 4.9.2.1 and the proof of 4.9.8, we can assume G1 is an adjoint\ngroup. We can assume (f, L(p) , v) is such that f is a good embedding w.r.t. p, cf. 2.3.6\n(see [Va2, 6.4.2] for p \u2265 5 and \u00a76 for its p = 3 analogue). Starting from the pair (T \u03c9 , \u03bc\u03c9 )\nof 4.1.5.4, we construct as in the proof of 4.12.12, a Shimura quadruple\n\u03c9\nposs\n(TQ\u03c9 , hposs\n),\n\u03c9 , TQp (Zp ), vp (\u03c9)\n\nwith TQ\u03c9 a maximal torus of G which is a Q\u2013form of the generic fibre of T \u03c9 and whose\nZariski closure in GZ(p) is a torus, and with TQ\u03c9p (Zp ) as the hyperspecial subgroup of\nTQ\u03c9p (Qp ). Let X\u03c9poss be the G(R)-conjugacy class of hposs\n\u03c9 . We get a Shimura pair\nposs\n(G, X\u03c9 ). The resulting injective map (cf. [De1, 1.6])\n(G, X\u03c9poss ) \u0592\u2192 (GSp(W, \u03c8), S)\n537\n\n\fis denoted by f\u03c9poss . Denoting by v\u03c9poss the prime of E(G, X\u03c9poss) divided by vp (\u03c9)poss , we\nget another triple\n(f\u03c9poss , L(p) , v\u03c9poss );\n2.3.6 and our assumption on f imply that it is still a SHS. Let N\u03c9poss be its integral\ncanonical model.\nX\u03c9poss might not be X itself; however, from [De2, 1.2.7-8], as \u03bc\u03c9 and \u03bc are\nGZ(p) (W (F))-conjugate, we get that (Gad , X\u03c9poss ad ) = (Gad , X ad ). So the Corollary follows, once we show that any W (F)-valued point z0 of N\u03c9poss factoring through the integral\n\u03c9\nposs\ncanonical model of (TQ\u03c9 , hposs\n) (see [Va2, 3.2.8]), has attached to it a\n\u03c9 , T (Zp ), vp (\u03c9)\nShimura adjoint Lie \u03c3\u0304-crystal isomorphic to the Shimura adjoint Lie \u03c3\u0304-crystal attached\nto C\u03c9 .\nAs this is a statement which can be reformulated purely in the \u00e9tale Zp -context, in\norder to benefit from previous notations, we argue it by working in the context of the\nSHS (f, L(p) , v) itself. So we use the notations of 4.2.1-4, with z0 factoring through the\nintegral canonical model T of a special quadruple (T, {h}, HT , vT ) \u0592\u2192 (G, X, H, v) having\nthe property that the Zariski closure of T in GZ(p) is a maximal torus. So V0 := W (F).\nDenoting by f |T the restriction of f to (T, {h}), the triple (f |T, L(p) , vT ) is a SHS (cf.\n2.3.6 and [Va2, 4.3.13]). We apply 4.1.1 and 4.2.3-4 to it. Let (v\u03b1 )JT , with JT a set\ncontaining J \u2032 , be the set of tensors of T (W \u2217 ) formed by adding the elements of Lie(T )\nto J \u2032 . Working in the \u00e9tale context we construct abstractly (as in 4.1.1) starting from\n(f |T, L(p) , vT ), a Shimura filtered \u03c3\u0304-crystal\n(MT \u2297W (k(vT )) V0 , FT1 \u2297W (k(vT )) V0 , \u03c6T , TV0 , (v\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208JT ).\nWorking in the crystalline cohomology context, we consider (as in 4.2.3-4) the Shimura\nfiltered \u03c3\u0304-crystal (M0 , F01 , \u03c60 , TV0 , (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208JT ) attached to the V0 -valued point (defined\nad\nby) z0 of T . Using the fact that two maximal tori of Gad\nV0 are GV0 (V0 )-conjugate and\nthat NT1 (K0 ) = NT1 (V0 )T1 (K0 ), with T1 as the image of TV0 in Gad\nV0 and with NT1 as\nad\nits normalizer in GV0 , we deduce that we can assume that, in the present situation of\n(f, L(p) , v) and z0 , g0 of 4.2.4 is a K0 -valued point of T1 . So the Shimura adjoint filtered\nLie \u03c3\u0304-crystal (Lie(Gad\nV0 ), \u03c60 ) defined by the natural inclusion of GV0 in GL(M0 ) is inner\nisomorphic to the Shimura adjoint filtered Lie \u03c3\u0304-crystal (Lie(Gad\nV0 ), g\u03c6T ) defined by the\nnatural inclusion of GV0 in GL(MT \u2297W (k(vT )) V0 ), with g \u2208 T1 (V0 ). Using Zp -structures\n(as in 2.2.9 8) and as in the proof of b) of 4.4.1 2)), we can assume g is the identity\nelement of T1 (V0 ) (variant: the proof of 3.11.1 c) can be entirely adapted to get that\nad\n(Lie(Gad\nV0 ), \u03c6T ) and (Lie(GV0 ), g\u03c6T ) are isomorphic under an isomorphism defined by an\nelement of T1 (V0 )). This ends the proof.\n4.12.12.6.0. Remarks. 1) If any homomorphism hs : ResC/R Gm \u2192 GSp(W \u2297Q\nR, \u03c8) defined by an element of S (we recall that f : (G, X) \u0592\u2192 (GSp(W, \u03c8), S)) and\nfactoring through GR , is defined by an element of X, then X\u03c9poss = X, \u2200\u03c9 \u2208 WG .\n[Ko2, 4.3] points out: this is always the case if f is a PEL type embedding, with all\nsimple factors of Gad of some An or Cn Lie type. Using [De2, 1.2.8] we can construct\n538\n\n\fmany more examples. For instance, the above paragraph applies in the context of [Va2,\n5.7.5]. Warning: [Va2, 2.5.1] points out that not always hs is defined by an element of\nX.\n2) [Va2, 3.2.7.1 f) and 3.3.3] imply that replacing the injective map\n\u03c9\nposs\n(TQ\u03c9 , hposs\n) \u0592\u2192 (G, X\u03c9poss , H, v\u03c9poss)\n\u03c9 , T (Zp ), vp (\u03c9)\n\nby its composite with an isomorphism\n(G, X\u03c9poss, H, v\u03c9poss)\u2192(G,\n \u0303\nX, H, v)\nposs\ndefined by an element of Gad\n= X and so v\u03c9poss = v.\nZ(p) (Z(p) ), we can always assume X\u03c9\nSo in the above proof of 4.12.12.6, references to 4.9.8 can be entirely avoided, as long as\nwe are just dealing with (f, L(p) , v).\n\nThe operations of the proof of 4.12.12.6 keep track of inner automorphisms of\nLie(Gad\nW (k) ) (cf. the def. of T\u03bc\u03c9 in 4.1.5.4 and 4.2.10) and so we conclude (cf. 4.1.5.5):\n4.12.12.6.1. Corollary. The number of strata of the quasi-ultra stratification of\nN1k(v1 ) is at least equal to the number of elements of the quotient set WG /RG (v).\n4.12.12.6.2. Examples. A. We first consider the case when all simple factors\nof Gad are of A1 Lie type. So the number of non-compact simple factors of Gad\nR is\ndimC (X) = dimC (X1 ). From 3.13.7.6.0 and 4.12.12.6.1 we get that the number of strata\nof the quasi-ultra stratification of N1k(v1 ) is precisely 2dimC (X1 ) .\nThese strata are in one-to-one correspondence to functions\nfs : S(1, dimC (X1 )) \u2192 {0, 1}\nin such a way that the dimension of the stratum s corresponding to fs is precisely\ndimC (X1 )\n\ndimC (X1 ) \u2212\n\nX\n\nfs (l)\n\nl=1\n\n(cf. 3.13.7.6.0 and 4.5.15.2.1). A stratum s1 corresponding to fs1 specializes to another\nstratum s2 corresponding to fs2 iff fs2 (l) \u2265 fs1 (l), \u2200l \u2208 S(1, dimC (X1 )) (cf. 3.13.7.6.0).\nIn particular there is only one open (resp. closed stratum: it is of dimension 0). In\nfact this closed stratum has a non-empty intersection with each connected component\nof N1k(v1 ) . To see this it is enough to show that the connected components of N1k(v1 )\nare permuted transitively by G1 (Apf ). It is enough to show \u2013cf. [Va2. 3.3.2]\u2013 that each\nconnected component of N1W (F) has a connected special fibre.\nWe can assume (Gad , X ad ) is (cf. the proof of 4.9.8) simple and is not (cf. [Va2,\n6.4.11]) of compact type. So [BHC, 11.4 and 11.6] implies: (Gad , X ad ) is the adjoint\nvariety of a Hilbert\u2013Blumenthal variety. Based on the proof of 4.9.8 we can assume\n539\n\n\f(f, L(p) , v) is a SHS associated to a Hilbert\u2013Blumenthal variety. But this case follows\nfrom [Ch1]. As a conclusion: for the A1 Lie type, the star of 4.2.8.1 can be removed.\nThis example represents the logical generalization of [GO]: loc. cit. deals only with\nHilbert\u2013Blumenthal varieties.\nB. We assume all simple factors of (Gad , X ad ) are such that:\nASS \u2200i \u2208 Hnc , the i-th cyclic factor of a Shimura-ordinary point of Nk(v) is one among\nthe list of 3.13.7.6.2.\nFor instance this is the case if:\nEX All simple factors of (Gad , X ad ) are of Bn , Cn or DnR type, or of A2l+1 Lie type such\nad\nthat all non-compact, simple factors of Gad\nR are isomorphic to SU (l + 1, l + 1)R , or\nH\nH\nof D2l type which involve groups which split over Qp , or of A2l or D2l+1 type which\ninvolve groups which over Qp are absolutely simple but do not split (l \u2208 N).\nFrom 3.13.7.6.1 C, 4.5.15.2.1 and 4.12.12.6.1 we get (under ASS; cf. also the list of\n3.13.7.6.2 and the cyclic diagonalizability property of 3.13.7.6.3):\nCorollary. There is a reduced, closed subscheme s01 of N1k(v1 ) of dimension 0 such\nthat any stratum of the quasi-ultra stratification of N1k(v1 ) of dimension 0 is a scalar\nextension of s01 . All points of s01 are toric. Moreover, the Shimura adjoint Lie \u03c3k\u0304 -crystals\nattached to k\u0304-valued points of s0 are all inner isomorphic.\nSimilarly, all Shimura \u03c3k\u0304 -crystals endowed with natural families of tensors (indexed\nby the set J \u2032 of 2.3.1) attached to k\u0304-valued points of s0 belonging to a fixed connected\ncomponent of Nk(v) are all 1J \u2032 -isomorphic; here s0 has the same significance for Nk(v)\nas s01 for N1k(v1 ) .\nC. We briefly go through two examples of pivotal points which are not among those\nof B, just to illustrate what type of computations we will have to perform in \u00a79-10 in\norder to handle the cases not covered by B. We consider a SHS (f, L(p) , v). We assume\nad\nand that Gad splits over Zp .\nGad\nR is SU (a, b)\nIf c := ab \u2208 N, then any W (k)-valued toric point of Nk(v) whose Shimura adjoint Lie\n\u03c3k -crystal is isomorphic to (End(M1 ), \u03c61 ), where (M1 , \u03c61 ) is the direct sum of a copies of\nthe \u03c3k -crystal (M2 , \u03c62 ) which has a lift (M2 , F21 , \u03c62 ) which is (isomorphic to) the circular\ndiagonalizable filtered \u03c3k -crystal having (see B of 2.2.22 3)) the type (1, 0, 0, ..., 0) (the\nnumber of 0's is c), is pivotal. This is a consequence of the Proposition of 4.5.15.2.1. We\njust need to remark that:\n\u2013 the group of automorphisms GA2 of the truncation mod p of (M2 , \u03c62 ) has (this\nis an easy exercise) dimension c (and so the group of automorphisms of (M1 , \u03c61 ) has\ndimension ca2 = ab = dimC (X));\n\u2013 the group of automorphisms GA\u20322 of the Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Hasse\u2013Witt map of\n(M2 , \u03c62 , GL(M2 )) has the same dimension as GA2 (the natural homomorphism GA2 \u2192\nGA\u20322 has finite kernel and from 3.13.7.1.1 and 3.13.7.2 we get that it is an epimorphism).\n540\n\n\fSimilarly, if (a, b) = (2, 3) one can check that starting from the type (1, 0, 1, 0, 0) and\ntaking (M1 , \u03c61 ) = (M2 , \u03c62 ) we get pivotal points.\n4.12.12.6.3. The null strata. We refer to 4.9.8. The stratum of the refined\nLie canonical stratification of Nk(v) whose geometric points are such that the Newton\npolygons of their attached Shimura adjoint Lie F -crystals are having only the slope 0,\nis called the null stratum of Nk(v) ; its points with values in fields are called null points\n(of Nk(v) ). It is the natural generalization of the usual supersingular strata of special\nfibres of integral canonical models of Siegel modular varieties. We now prove 1.12.1 A)\n(in some sense we just refine a little bit the proof of 4.3.6).\nBased on the proof of 4.9.8, we can assume we are dealing with the integral canonical\nmodel Nk(v) of a SHS (f, L(p) , v). So we refer to 4.1 and 4.3.1 with k = F; we assume B\ncontains T . Based on 4.12.12.6.0, it is enough to show the existence of \u03c90 \u2208 N (W (F))\n(see 4.1.5) such that the Shimura Lie \u03c3F -crystal attached to C\u03c90 has all slopes equal to\n0. First, we consider the examples provided by EX of 4.12.12.6.2 B. For each i \u2208 Hnc ,\nlet \u03c90i \u2208 GiW (F) (W (F)) normalizing the image of TW (F) in GiW (F) and such that:\n\u2013 looking at the simple factors of GiW (F) only one component in them of \u03c90i is noni\ntrivial; let Gi0 be this factor corresponding to the non-trivial component \u03c900\nof \u03c90i (it is\ndefined by picking up an element i0 of the set Hi of 4.3.1.1) (warning: we do not assume\nGi0 is such that the image of \u03bcW (F) in it is non-zero);\ni\n\u2013 \u03c900\ntakes the image of BW (F) in Gi0 into its opposite w.r.t. the image of TW (F) in\n\nGi0 .\nWe take \u03c90 \u2208 N (W (F)) such that its image in GiW (F) is \u03c90i , \u2200i \u2208 Hnc . The Newton\npolygon of the Shimura Lie \u03c3F -crystal attached to C\u03c90 has only one slope: it is 0; this is\nan immediate consequence of the choice of \u03c90 (see the numbering in 3.4.3.2 and the item\nXI in [Bou2, planche I to IV]). This takes care of the Bn , Cn and DnR types entirely. To\ntake care of the other types, we can assume (Gad , X ad ) is simple of An (n \u2265 2) or DnH\n(n \u2265 4) type. It is enough to deal with a fixed i \u2208 Hnc .\nSecond, we assume that Gi of 4.3.1.1 is either non-split (i.e. we are in the case when\nthe i-th cyclic adjoint factor associated to a G-ordinary point of Nk(v) is with involution)\nof An or D2n+1 Lie type or it is split of D2n Lie type, with n \u2265 2. In this case the same\nchoice of \u03c9i (and the same argument) makes the thing work as in the case when we were\nworking with the examples provided by EX of 4.12.12.6.2 B.\nSo we are left with the cases: Gi is split of An or D2n+1 Lie type or is non-split of\nD2n Lie type, with n \u2265 2. We use the same type of Weyl element \u03c90i : we assume i0 has\ni\nbeen fixed and we still denote by \u03c900\n\u2208 Gi0 (W (F)) the (unique) non-trivial component\ni\nof \u03c90 . Let ji \u2208 N be the smallest number such that the cocharacter \u03c90i \u03bciW (F) (\u03c90i )\u22121 of\ni\nTW (F) is fixed by \u03c3\u0304 ji . It is enough to show that we can choose \u03c900\nsuch that the product\nP DIT :=\n\nji\nY\n\n\u03c3\u0304 s \u03c90i \u03bciW (F) (\u03c90i )\u22121 \u03c3\u0304 \u2212s\n\ns=1\n\n541\n\n\fis trivial (one can view this additively as well). Warning: here, in order to benefit from\n4.1.2 (IT), we choose a Frobenius endomorphism of M \u2297W (k(v)) W (F) of the form \u03c3\u0304\u03c90i \u03bc( p1 )\nand not of the usual form \u03c90i \u03c3\u0304\u03bc( p1 ).\nThird, we assume Gi is split of An Lie type. We identify Gi0 with the adjoint\ngroup of the SLn+1 -group Gsc\ni0 of a free W (F)-module Mi0 of rank n + 1. We consider a\nW (F)-basis {e1 , ..., en+1 } of Mi0 such that:\n\u2013 each element of it is normalized by the maximal torus of Gsc\ni0 which has the same\nimage in Gi0 as TW (F) ;\n\u2013 \u2200i \u2208 S(1, n + 1), < e1 , ..., ei > is normalized by the Borel subgroup of Gsc\ni0 which\nhas the same image in Gi0 as BW (F) .\ni\nWe take \u03c900\nto be the image in Gi0 (W (F)) of any element \u03c90isc of Gsc\ni0 (W (F)) which\ntakes < ei > into < ei+1 >, i = 1, n + 1, with en+2 := e1 . The fact that P DIT is trivial\nis a consequence of the circular property of \u03c90isc as well as of 3.4.2.1-2.\n\nLast, we assume Gi is split of D2n+1 Lie type or non-split of D2n Lie type, with\nn \u2265 2. The proof of 4.3.6 (via the proof of Fact 2 of it) allows us to shift our attention\nto the non-split A3 Lie type and so the above part applies. This ends the proof of 1.12.1\nA).\n4.12.12.6.4. The strong form of the generalized Manin problem.\nprove 1.12.1 B) and C). The arguments of 4.12.12.6.3 were presented in the\nform. So they apply in the general context to give us that in each class of\n\u03c3k -crystals there is an element defined by a Shimura \u03c3k -crystal whose attached\nLie \u03c3k -crystal has all slopes 0. We have:\n\nWe now\nabstract\nShimura\nShimura\n\nCorollary. We refer to the notations of 3.9.7.2 (with k = k\u0304). There is w0 \u2208\nR0 (W (k)) normalizing T which depends only on the Shimura adjoint Lie \u03c3k -crystal attached to (M, g\u03c6, R0) such that the Newton polygons of (M, \u03c6) and of (M, hg\u03c6) are the\nsame as of the cyclic diagonalizable Shimura \u03c3k -crystal (M, w0 g\u03c6, T ).\nProof: Let w0 \u2208 R0 (W (k)) normalizing T be such that the Shimura adjoint Lie \u03c3k crystal attached to the Shimura \u03c3k -crystal (M, w0 g\u03c6, R0 ) has all slopes 0. The Corollary\nfollows from the Corollary of 3.9.7.2 and from the class invariant part of 2.2.24.1 applied\nto Cl(M, g\u03c6, R0).\nCorollary can be entirely adapted to the generalized Shimura context provided by\nthe \u03c1-representations of 4.5.4 (cf. 3.9.7.2.1 1)). So 1.12.1 B) follows from it and from\n4.12.12.6.0. To detail this, as in 4.12.12.6.3 we can assume we are dealing with the integral\ncanonical model Nk(v) of a SHS (f, L(p) , v). We refer to 4.5.4. We can assume y is not a\nnull point (cf. 1.12.1 A)). We can assume that the parabolic subgroup Py of GW (k) whose\nLie algebra is W0 (Lie(GW (k) ), \u03c6y ) has a maximal torus Ty normalizing Fz1 (cf. 2.3.17 and\n3.9.7.1). We can assume \u03bcy factors through Ty . Let Ry be the Levi subgroup of Py\ncontaining Ty . Let U Ry be the unipotent radical of Py . Let gy \u2208 Py (W (k)) be such that\nthe quadruple (My , Fz1 , gy \u03c6y , Ty ) is a Shimura filtered \u03c3k -crystal. Let wy \u2208 Ry (W (k))\n542\n\n\fnormalizing Ty and such that all slopes of (Lie(Ry ), wy gy \u03c6y ) are 0. Writing \u03c6y = ay \u03bcy ( p1 ),\nwe consider a Zp -structure (Ny , GZp , (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J \u2032 ) as in 2.2.9 8) (so Ny is the Zp -submodule\nof My formed by elements fixed by ay ); w.r.t. it we can write \u03c3k instead of ay .\nFor what follows, (in connection to the \u03c1-stratifications of 4.5.4) it is more convenient\nto work directly with the Zp -structures provided by 2.2.9 8), without appealing to d) of\n4.4.1 3). \u03c1 Cz (of 4.5.4) is isomorphic to (Ny \u2297Zp W (k), \u03c3k \u03c1B(k) (\u03bcy ( p1 ))). So its Newton\npolygon is the same as the Newton polygon of the following generalized Shimura pdivisible object\nmod\n\u03c1 Cy\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\n1\n:= Ny \u2297Zp W (k), \u03c1W (k)(wy gy )\u03c3k \u03c1B(k) (\u03bcy ( )), Im(\u03c1W (k) )\np\n\n(cf. the mentioned adaptations of the Corollary; so this is a consequence of the P>0 (B(k))conjugacy part of 3.9.7.2 \u2013P>0 of 3.9.7.2 is\u0001denoted\nhere by U Py \u2013 and of 2.2.24.1 applied\n\u0001\n1\nto Ny \u2297Zp W (k), \u03c1W (k)(\u2217)\u03c3k \u03c1B(k) \u03bcy ( p ) , Ry , with \u2217 \u2208 {gy , wy gy }), for any \u03c1 as in\n4.5.4. The upper index \"mod\" stands for modification (of the non-filtered version of\n\u03c1 Cz ).\nFrom 4.12.12.6 we deduce the existence of a k-valued toric point y1 of Nk(v) such\nthat its attached Shimura adjoint Lie \u03c3k -crystal is inner isomorphic to the one attached\nto (My , Fz1 , wy gy \u03c6y , GW (k) ) (the Zp -structures of 3.11.2 B applied in the context of\n(My , Fz1 , wy gy \u03c6y , Ty ) allow us to work over k and not just over F; of course, here we\ncan assume that k = F). But it is an easy exercise to see that the Newton polygon of\n\u03c1 Cz1 , with z1 a W (k)-valued point of N lifting y1 and such that its attached Shimura\nfiltered \u03c3k -crystal is cyclic diagonalizable, is the same as the Newton polygon of \u03c1 Cmod\n,\ny\nfor any \u03c1 as in 4.5.4. It can be solved as follows. If we assume d) of 4.4.1 3), then we\njust need to use arguments with semisimple elements as in 2.2.24.1 and as in the proof\n). If we do not assume d) of 4.4.1 3), then\nof 4.2.7, in the context of the class Cl(\u03c1 Cmod\ny\nwe just need to add that the rational variant of 4.4.12 obtained by combining c) of 4.4.1\n3) with 2.3.13.1, allows us still to appeal to the mentioned arguments. We conclude: y\nand y1 are k-valued points of the same stratum of the absolute stratification of Nk(v) .\n1.12.1 C) follows from 1.12.1 B) and the above paragraph (cf. also 4.1.5-6, 4.2.10\nand 4.5.11). As in the elimination process of 3.13.7.3.1 B, we get that in fact in 1.12.1\nC) we can replace the Weyl group of G1C by the Weyl group of the extension to C of the\nproduct of the simple, non-compact factors of G1ad\nR .\nExercise. Show that the map fG of 4.5.11 a) is surjective. Hint: combine the\nCorollary with 4.5.15.2.5 or with the arguments of the proof of 4.4.1 referring to the\nindependence part of b) of 4.4.1 3).\n4.12.12.6.4.1. Examples. The estimate of 1.12.1 C) is very gross in general.\nHowever, there are examples in which its bound is attained (for instance, this happens\nc\nwhen all factors of Gad\nZp are split of A1 Lie type and H is the empty set). We assume\nnow that we have a SHS (f, L(v), p), with (Gad , X ad ) simple of Bn Lie type and with Gad\nR\nhaving at most 2 non-compact factors. We have:\n543\n\n\fCorollary. The absolute stratification of Nk(v) has:\na) n + 1 strata if Gad\nR has only one non-compact factor;\n2\nnc\nb) (n + 1) strata if Gad\nhas 2 elements;\nR has two non-compact factors and H\nnc\nc) n([ n2 ] + 2) \u2212 [ n2 ]([ n2 ] + 1) strata if Gad\nhas\nR has two non-compact factors and H\n1 element.\nProof: We use 4.5.6.2 A and 4.12.12.6.4. Let m (resp. l) be the number of simple\n(resp. of non-compact, simple) factors of Gad\nR . We refer to [Bou2, planche II] for the\ndescription of the Weyl group of the Bn Lie type; below we use it freely. Everything boils\ndown to the following situation. For s \u2208 S(1, m), we consider a free W (F)-module Vs of\nrank 2n + 1 and a W (F)-basis Bs = {es1 , es2 , ..., es2n+1} of it. We consider a cocharacter \u03bc\nof GL(V1 \u2295W (F) ... \u2295W (F) Vm ) which:\n\u2013 acts trivially on esj , if j \u2265 3 or if s > l;\n\u2013 acts as the multiplication with pj on es3\u2212j , if s \u2208 S(1, l) and j \u2208 S(1, 2).\n2\n\nWe have a permutation \u03c0 of S(1, m) and we look at the Newton polygons of h\u03bc(p)\nwhere\nh \u2208 GL(V1 \u2295W (F) ... \u2295W (F) Vm )(W (F))\nfixes es2n+1 and takes each pair (es2q1 \u22121 , es2q1 ) into a pair of one of the following two\n\u03c0(s)\n\n\u03c0(s)\n\n\u03c0(s)\n\n\u03c0(s)\n\nforms (e2q\u22121 , e2q ) or (e2q , e2q\u22121 ), with q, q1 \u2208 S(1, n), \u2200s \u2208 S(1, m). Here h\u03bc(p) is\nviewed as a B(F)-valued point of GL(V1 \u2295W (F) ... \u2295W (F) Vm ) and Newton polygons are\nobtained as usual (using 1q times valuations of the eigenvalues of hq , with q \u2208 N big\nenough). For each non-empty subset C of S(1, m) permuted transitively by \u03c0 we want\nto first count the number n(C) of Newton polygons of the restriction r(C) of h\u03bc(p) to\nV (C) := (\u2295s\u2208C Vs )[ p1 ], with h varying as described, and second we want to take the\nproduct of all these numbers n(C). All Newton polygons we get are 0-symmetric and so\nit is enough to deal with non-negative slopes.\nIf C \u2229 S(1, l) is the empty set, then n(C) = 1. If C \u2229 S(1, l) has only one element\ns0 , then the Newton polygon of r(C) has either only slope 0 or the only positive slope of\n1\n0\nit is |C|s\nwith multiplicity |C| s, where s is the number of pairs of the form (es2q\u22121\n, es2q0 ),\n0\nq \u2208 S(1, n), or of the form (es2q0 , es2q\u22121\n), q \u2208 S(2, n), which are in the orbit or (es10 , es20 ).\nSo n(C) = n + 1. This takes care of a) and b).\nIf l = 2 and S(1, 2) \u2282 C, then we split the computation of n(C) as follows. We\ncount:\ni) 1 for the Newton polygon having all slopes 0;\n2\nii) n for Newton polygons which have only one positive slope |C|a\nwith multiplicity\na |C|, a \u2208 S(1, n); they correspond to the case when e11 and e21 are in the same orbit under\nh but this orbit does not contain e12 (and so does not contain e22 );\n1\nwith multiiii) n \u2212 1 for Newton polygons which have only one positive slope |C|a\nplicity a |C|, a \u2208 S(1, n \u2212 1); they correspond to the case when the orbit of e1j under h\n544\n\n\fdoes not contain e12\u2212j or e2j or e22\u2212j but e22\u2212j and e2j are in the same orbit under h for\nsome fixed j \u2208 S(1, 2);\niv) 1 for each pair (a, b) \u2208 S(1, n) \u00d7 S(1, n), with a + b \u2264 n and a < b.\n1\nFor each pair as in iv) we get a Newton polygon which has 2 positive slopes |C|a\n1\nwith multiplicities a |C| and respectively b |C|; it corresponds to the cases when\nand |C|b\n\nthe orbit of ej1 under h does not contain ej2 or e3\u2212j\nor e3\u2212j\nbut has aj elements, j = 1, 2,\n1\n2\nwith (aj , bj ) equal to (a, b) or with (b, a). Warning: the case corresponding to a = b gives\nbirth to Newton polygons which were already counted (see ii)). We end up with\nn\n\n1 + n + (n \u2212 1) +\n\n[2]\nX\n\n(n \u2212 2j)\n\nj=1\n\ndistinct Newton polygons. This sum is exactly the number of c). This ends the proof.\nIf n = 1 (or n = 2 or n = 3 or n = 4 or n = 5) then in c) we get 2 (or 4 or 7 or 10\nor 14) strata.\n4.12.12.6.4.2. Remark. We refer to 4.5.8 1). N (Gad , X ad , v ad ) is the number of\nstrata of the canonical Lie stratification of Nk(v) and N1 (Gad , X ad , v ad ) is the number of\nstrata of the refined canonical Lie stratification of Nk(v) . This follows from 1.12.1 B). So,\nin 4.9.8 a) we can replace \"indexed by a subset of RLN P (Gad , X ad , v ad )\" by: indexed\nby RLN P (Gad , X ad , v ad ).\n4.12.12.6.4.3. Remark. We consider a p-divisible group with a reductive structure\n(M\u0303 , \u03c6\u0303, G\u0303) of p \u2212 MF[a,b] (W (k)). Then there is g\u0303 \u2208 G\u0303(W (k)) such that (M\u0303 , g\u0303\u03c6\u0303, G\u0303) has a\nlift which is cyclic diagonalizable and all the slopes of its attached b \u2212 a-Lie \u03c3k -crystal are\nzero. The proof of this is entirely the same as 4.12.12.6.3. We can assume G\u0303B(k) is adjoint\nand the Lie algebras of its simple factors are permuted transitively by \u03c6\u0303. As in 3.2.3,\nwe can assume there is a maximal torus T\u0303 of G\u0303 such that its Lie algebra is normalized\nby \u03c6\u0303; so we look for g\u0303's normalizing T\u0303 . If G\u0303 is of G2 , F4 , E7 , E8 , Bn or Cn Lie type,\nthen (cf. item IX in [Bou2, planches II, III, and VI to IX]) we can use the same type of\nWeyl elements as in the part of 4.12.12.6.3 referring to 4.12.12.6.2 EX. If G\u0303 is of An or\nDn Lie type, we can use the same type of Weyl elements as in the cases of 4.12.12.6.3\ncorresponding to the same Lie types.\nIf G\u0303 is of E6 Lie type we refer to [Va6] and [Va8]. Here we will just mention that\nin many cases, the situation gets reduced to the A5 Lie type and so we can apply the\nprevious paragraph (the \"embedding\" of A5 into E6 is provided by \"removing\" the second\nnode of the Dynkin's diagram of the E6 Lie type). In particular, this reduction is possible\nif (Lie(G\u0303), \u03c6\u0303) is a cyclic Shimura adjoint Lie \u03c3k -crystal of E6 type. So we conclude:\nCorollary (the abstract strong \u2013Weyl\u2013 form of the generalized Manin\nproblem). The Corollary of 4.12.12.6.4 holds for the generalized Shimura context.\n4.12.12.6.5. Extra types of points. We refer to 4.12.12.6. A point y of N1k(v1 )\nwith values in an algebraically closed field is called:\n545\n\n\f\u2013 non-integral, if its Lie p-rank (defined as in 4.3.6, via 4.9.17) is 0;\n\u2013 quasi-pivotal, if it is a toric and a non-integral point at the same time;\n\u2013 super-null, if it is a toric and a null point and the same time;\n\u2013 pivotal, if it is super-null and belongs to a stratum of the quasi-ultra stratification\nof dimension 0;\n\u2013 non-null, if it is not a null point;\n\u2013 partially null, if there is i \u2208 Hnc such that the i-th cyclic adjoint factor attached\nto y has all slopes 0;\n\u2013 totally non-null, if it is not partially null;\n\u2013 partially U -ordinary (resp. partially Shimura-ordinary), if there i \u2208 Hnc such that\nthe i-th cyclic adjoint factor attached to y is U -ordinary (resp. has a lift which is of\nparabolic type);\n\u2013 quasi U -ordinary, if it is a toric and totally non-null point at the same time;\n\u2013 isom-canonical, if its attached Shimura adjoint F -crystal is isom-canonical;\n\u2013 quasi-final, if its attached Shimura adjoint F -crystal is quasi-final.\nBy natural passage, we use the same terminology for points of N1k(v1 ) with values\nin a field. Each null point is non-integral and so each super-null point is quasi-pivotal.\nThe toric points of the Corollary of 4.12.12.6.2 B are pivotal.\nDefinition. A lift z \u2208 N1W (k) of a partially U -ordinary point y \u2208 N1k is called a\npartial U -canonical lift, if \u2200i \u2208 Hnc such that the i-th cyclic adjoint factor attached to y\nis U -ordinary, the lift of it defined naturally by z is a U -canonical lift.\n4.12.12.6.6. More on quasi U -ordinariness and on the A1 Lie type case.\n1) 4.4.13.2 implies: any U -ordinary point of N1k(v1 ) is quasi U -ordinary. This generalizes 4.6 P3.\n2) If all factors of Gad are of A1 Lie type, then the converse of 1) holds. More\nprecisely, we have:\nFact. Any quasi U -ordinary point of N1k(v1 ) is a T -ordinary point.\nProof: We assume k = k\u0304. As we are dealing with the A1 Lie types, for any k-valued\nquasi U -ordinary point y of N1k(v1 ) , the Lie subalgebra p=0 of Lie(Gad\nW (k) ) corresponding\nad\nto the slope 0 of its attached Shimura adjoint Lie \u03c3k -crystal (Lie(GW (k) ), \u03c6y ), is (cf. also\n2.2.19.2 and the Criterion of 2.2.22 1)) the Lie algebra of a maximal torus of Gad\nW (k) . So\n(Lie(Gad\nW (k) ), \u03c6y ) has lifts which are of toric type. So the Fact follows from 4.4.13.2 and\ndef. 4.4.13.1 c).\n3) We refer to 4.12.12.6. We denote by\nN SU (N1k(v1 ) )\n546\n\n\fthe number of strata of the quasi-ultra stratification of N1k(v1 ) having U -ordinary points.\nIf Gad has all simple factors of A1 Lie type, based on 2) it can be computed as follows (see\n[Va9] for general computations). We can refer just to the context of a SHS (f, L(p) , v),\nwith all factors of Gad of A1 Lie type (cf. 4.12.12.6.2 A). We use the notations of 4.3.1.1,\nwith k = F.\nWe fix i \u2208 Hnc . Let d(i) be as in 4.5.15.2.1: it is the number of elements\nj \u2208 Hi such that the image of the composite of the cocharacter \u03bcW (k) of GW (k)\nwith the natural projection of GW (k) on Gj is non-trivial; let Si be the subset of\nHi formed by such j's. We consider the i-th cyclic adjoint filtered Lie \u03c3\u0304-crystal\n(Lie(GiW (F) ), \u03c6z , F 0 (Lie(GiW (F) )), F 1 (Lie(GiW (F) )) attached to a Shimura-canonical lift\nz : Spec(W (F)) \u2192 N (see 4.2.4). Based on b) of 4.4.1 2), we can assume \u03c6z is \u03c6 \u2297 1 (see\n4.1.1). We work under 4.1.4.1.\nBased on 2) and 4.12.12.6.2\nA, we need to determine the number\nQ\nQ of elements \u03c9i of\nthe Weyl group WG (i) of j\u2208Si Gj such that, denoting by g\u03c9i \u2208 j\u2208Si Gj (W (F)) an\narbitrary representative of it normalizing the image T (i) of TW (F) in GiW (F) ,\nL(\u03c9i ) := (Lie(GiW (F) ), g\u03c9i (\u03c6 \u2297 1), F 0 (Lie(GiW (F) )), F 1 (Lie(GiW (F) ))\nis of toric type. We consider an arbitrary j \u2208 Si . Let Hj be the Ga subgroup of Gj which\nis normalized by T (i) and such that Lie(Hj ) \u2282 F 0 (Lie(GiW (F) )). Let x be an arbitrary\n\u00012d(i)\ngenerator of Lie(Hj ). g\u03c9i (\u03c6 \u2297 1)\ntakes x into a multiple of pn(\u03c9i ) x by an invertible\nelement of W (F); here\nn(\u03c9i ) \u2208 S(\u2212d(i), d(i)).\nBased on the circular property expressed by 3.4.2.1 and on the 0-symmetric property\nof 2.2.3 1), we have: L(\u03c9i ) is T -ordinary iff n(\u03c9i ) 6= 0. The number of elements \u03c9i \u2208\nWG (i) such that n(\u03c9i ) 6= 0 is precisely the number of 2d(i)-tuples (x1 , ..., x2d(i)) formed\nby elements of the set I \u0303 := {\u22121, 1} and having the following three properties:\nP1. The product xs xs+d(i) does not depend on s \u2208 S(1, d(i));\nP2. The sum of its entries is non-zero;\nP3. Its first entry is 1.\nP1 just expresses that g\u03c9i has just d(i) non-zero components in the simple factors\nof GiW (F) , while P3 pays attention to the choice of Hj . So we need to find the number\nnd(i) of d(i) \u2212 1-tuples formed by elements of the set I \u0303 such that the sum of their entries\nis different from \u22121. If d(i) is odd, we have:\nnd(i) = 2d(i)\u22121 .\nIf d(i) is even, we have:\nd(i)\n\n2\n.\nnd(i) = 2d(i)\u22121 \u2212 Cd(i)\u22121\n\n547\n\n\fAllowing i \u2208 Hnc to vary, we conclude:\nN SU (A1 )\n\nN SU (Nk(v) ) =\n\nY\n\nnd(i) .\n\ni\u2208Hnc\n\n4) Referring to 3), the Newton polygon of L(\u03c9i ) is uniquely determined by the sum\nP2d(i)\ni=1 xi . So to count the number of strata of the refined canonical Lie stratification of\nNk(v) , we need to count the number of such sums which are non-negative, for 2d(i)-tuples\n \u0303 As this number is obviously\n(x1 , ..., x2d(i) ) which are subject to P1 and have entries in I.\n[ d(i)+3\n], from 4.12.12.6.4.2, 4.5.6.1 and the proof of 4.9.8 we get that the number of strata\n2\nof the absolute stratification of N1k(v1 ) is\nN P (A1 )\n\nN1 (Gad , X ad , v ad ) =\n\nY \u0002 d(i) + 3 \u0003\n.\n2\nnc\n\ni\u2208H\n\n4.12.12.6.7. piv-invariants. We refer to 4.5.15.2.1. From its proof we get that\nlocally in the Zariski topology of NF /H0 , the F-valued pivotal points define a locally\nclosed subscheme. As the Weyl group WG of 4.1.5 is finite, the number of isomorphism\nclasses of Shimura adjoint Lie \u03c3\u0304-crystals attached to F-valued pivotal points of NF is\nfinite (4.12.12.6.2 B already points out many situations in which it is 1). We deduce that\nthe number of F-valued pivotal points of NF /H0 is finite. Based on 4.9.9, this extends to\nN1F /H01 , with H01 an arbitrary compact, open subgroup of G1 (Apf ). We denote by\npiv(G1 ,X1 ,v1 ) (H01 )\nthe number of F-valued pivotal points of N1F /H01 and refer to it as the piv-invariant of\nH01 w.r.t. the triple (G1 , X1 , v1 ). Its independence on H1 is checked as in [Va2, 6.4.6 3)].\n4.12.12.6.7.1. The case of curves. We assume dimC (X) = 1. So Sh(G, X)\nis a Shimura curve; in particular, Gad is a simple Q\u2013group of A1 Lie type. From\n4.12.12.6.2 A we get that the quasi-ultra stratification of Nk(v) has precisely 2 strata: the\nShimura-ordinary locus and its complement, to be referred as the pivotal locus. Based\non 4.12.12.6.2 B), this matches 4.12.12.6.5; we get that all points of Nk(v) with values\nin fields are toric. We also get that piv(G1 ,X1 ,v1 ) (H01 ) counts the number of F-valued of\nN1F /H01 which are not Shimura-ordinary. See [Ih, (6) of p. 17] for the computation of\npiv(G1 ,X1 ,v1 ) (H01 ) in many particular cases.\n4.12.12.7. A second approach to (integral) Manin problems. Besides the\nabove approach (see 4.12.4 and 4.12.12) to solving integral Manin problems and based\non:\ni) the isogeny property stated in [Va2, 1.7] (see also 1.15.7), on\nii) Theorem 14 of 1.12.1, on\niii) d) of 4.4.1 3), and on\n548\n\n\fiv) the passage from the Hodge type to the preabelian type (see 4.9.4, 4.9.7-9 and\n4.12.5-6),\nthere is a second approach. As there is nothing else to be done to replace iii) or iv), we\nneed to refer just to a second approach to the completion property of 3.6.15 A. It relies\non:\nv) the possibility of determining which strata of the ultimate adjoint stratification\nof Nk(v) are closed;\nvi) the assumed existence of pivotal points (based on 4.12.12.6 and on 3.13.7.3, in \u00a710\nwe will include computations pointing out that \u2013at least in majority of cases\u2013 4.12.12.6.2\nB holds in general);\nvii) the Expectation of 3.13.7.1.\nThe use of pivotal points is an idea first developed (in connection to Newton polygons) for Siegel modular varieties in [Oo2]. Part of the philosophy behind v) to vii) can\nbe formulated as the following question:\nQ When the category GSC(Nk(v) ) has a final object?\nThe density part of 4.2.1 and b) of 4.4.1 2) can be interpreted as:\nCorollary. GSC(Nk(v) ) has an initial object.\n4.12.12.8. Dieudonn\u00e9's invariants. Let (G1 , X1 , H1 , v1 ) and H01 have the same\nsignificance as in 4.12.12.6 and 4.12.12.6.7. Let q1 \u2208 N be such that k(v1 ) = Fpq1 . Let\nq \u2208 N. The number\nDq (G1 , X1 , H1 , v1 , H01 )\nof strata of the ultimate adjoint stratification of N1k(v1 ) containing F-valued points lifting\nFpqq1 -valued points of N1k(v1 ) /H01 , is referred as the level-q Dieudonn\u00e9 invariant of H01\nw.r.t. the triple (G1 , X1 , v1 ).\n4.12.13. Variants. We take p \u2265 2.\n1) Theorem 2 of 3.15.1 (or 3.6.7.1 and 3.11.1 for p \u2265 3) can be interpreted as the\nsolution of an integral Manin problem: Any Shimura filtered \u03c3k -crystal (M, F 1 , \u03c6, G\u0303) can\nbe connected (through the p-adic completion of an N-pro-\u00e9tale scheme over a smooth,\naffine W (k)-scheme, having a special fibre which is a connected, AG k-scheme) with a\nG\u0303-canonical lift (M, F 1 , \u03c61 , G\u0303). Moreover, Theorem 2 of 3.15.1 and 3.6.18.8.3 point out\nthat often there are variants of these over any perfect field of characteristic p.\nWe have as well variants for quasi (even pseudo) Shimura filtered F -crystals over\nperfect fields (cf. 3.6.1.6).\n2) The proofs of 4.12.12 and 4.12.12.2 show that (cf. also 2.3.3.1), in 4.12.12 and\n4.12.12.2, if D and its dual are not \u00e9tale, then instead of an affine W (k)-scheme MD\nwe can work with a connected, projective, smooth scheme PD over W (k), such that the\np-divisible group over it is uni plus versal in each k-valued point of PD . In other words,\nin the case when D is the p-divisible group of an elliptic curve, we can still use the first\n549\n\n\fparagraph of 4.12.12.0 in the context of a (p = 2) SHS (f, L(p) , v), with Gad an absolutely\nsimple Q\u2013group of A1 Lie type whose Q\u2013rank is 0 and which splits over Qp .\nThis usage goes as follows. It is 2.3.5.1 (and 2.3.18 A for p = 2) which guarantees\nthe existence of such a (p = 2) SHS. Moreover, as its construction (see [Va2, 6.5.1.1\nand 6.6.5]) is based on [De2, 2.3.10], from [De2, 2.3.13] we get that we can assume\nGab = Gm . So GZp is the GL-group of a free Zp -module of rank 2. We consider a nontrivial subrepresentation of it of its representation on L\u2217(p) \u2297Z(p) Zp which is defined by a\ndirect summand DS of rank 2. It is 4.3.6 (or 4.12.12.6.1) which guarantees that there are\nk-valued points of N , such that the p-divisible groups associated to them via Fontaine's\ncomparison theory and this DS (see 4.12.12.0), are isomorphic to the p-divisible group\nof an arbitrary a priori given elliptic curve over k.\nMoreover, choosing H0 small enough, we can assume PD is of general type (for\ninstance, see [Mi4, 1.2 of \u00a72]).\n3) We have a variant of Theorem 13 of 1.12 in the principally quasi-polarized context:\nits proof is entirely the same (though slightly easier due to the fact that we do not have\nto split the discussion \u2013see the proof of 4.12.12\u2013 in terms of some reflex field being Q or\nnot; we always can assume it is Q).\n4) There are simple proofs of Serre\u2013Tate's deformation theory: for instance, see\nDrinfeld's proof in [Ka3, ch. 1]. Also in [MFK, ch. 6.3] a simple theory of deformations\nof abelian varieties is presented. So, based on this last two loc. cit. and 4.12.12.5 we\nreobtain the local deformation theory of p-divisible groups over a perfect field k1 , i.e. we\nreobtain [Il, 4.8] (standard Galois descent allows us to descend from k1 to k1 ). Warning:\nthis approach avoids entirely the use of [Me], [BBM], [BM] or of [Il].\nLet m \u2208 N \u222a {0}. Let R := W (k)[[x1 , ..., xm]] and let \u03a6R be a Frobenius lift of it.\n4.12.14. The general local integral Manin problem for Siegel modular\nvarieties. We consider a SHS of the form (1(GSp(W,\u03c8),S) , L(p) , p). So, with the standard\nnotations, M = N . The problem is to determine all principally quasi-polarized p-divisible\nobjects of MF[0,1](R) associated to principally quasi-polarized p-divisible groups over R,\nobtained from the one of (A, PA ) by pull back through morphisms Spec(R) \u2192 N .\n4.12.15. The general local integral Manin problem for a SHS (f, L(p) , v).\nLet (f, L(p) , v) be a SHS. The problem is: which principally quasi-polarized p-divisible\nobjects with tensors of MF[0,1] (R) are associated to the pull back of the principally\nquasi-polarized p-divisible group of (A, PA ) and of (de Rham components of) Hodge\ncycles (w\u03b1A )\u03b1\u2208J \u2032 of A through morphisms Spec(R) \u2192 N ?\n4.12.16. The general local integral Manin problem for a Shimura quadruple (G, X, H, v) of preabelian type, with (v, 2) = 1. The problem is to determine\nwhich Lie p-divisible objects of MF[\u22121,1](R) are isomorphic to Shimura adjoint filtered\nLie F -crystals over R/pR attached to (cf. 4.9.20) morphisms Spec(R) \u2192 N .\n4.12.17. The solution of 4.12.14. The answer is: any principally quasi-polarized\np-divisible object of MF[0,1] (R). Argument: 3.6.18.7.1 a) (applied in the context of a principally quasi-polarized pseudo Shimura \u03c3k -crystal (M0 , g\u03c6, Sp(M0, \u03c8), \u03c8)), allows us to\n550\n\n\f\u2207\nassume we are dealing with a principally quasi-polarized p-divisible object of MF[0,1]\n(R).\nSo the answer follows from 4.12.4, the deformation theory of abelian varieties and 2.2.21\nUP.\n\n4.12.18. The solution of 4.12.15 in the case N has the completion property.\nWe use the notations of 4.12.5. The answer is: any such p-divisible object of the form\n(M0 \u2297W (k) R, F01 \u2297W (k) R, gR (\u03c60 \u2297 1), (v\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J \u2032 , \u03c8\u0303),\nwith gR an arbitrary element of G0Z(p) (R). As in 4.12.17, this is an easy consequence\nof 3.6.18.7.1 a) (applied in the context of a principally quasi-polarized pseudo Shimura\n\u03c3k -crystal (M0 , g\u03c60 , G0W (k) , (v\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J \u2032 , \u03c8\u0303)), 4.12.5 and 2.2.21 UP (cf. also Fact 4 of 2.3.11).\n4.12.19. The solution of 4.12.16 in case N ad (of 4.12.6) has the completion\nproperty. We use the notations of 4.12.6. The answer is: any such p-divisible object of\nthe form\n0\nad\n1\nad\nad\nad 1\n(Lie(Gad\nR ), gR (\u03c3\u03bc ( ) \u2297 1), F (Lie(GR )), F (Lie(GR ))),\np\nad\n0\nad\n1\nad\nwith gR\n\u2208 Gad\nZ(p) (R). Here F (Lie(GR )) and F (Lie(GR )) are obtained as usual from\n(the extension to R of) the cocharacter \u03bcad of 4.12.6.\nTo argue this, we consider a SHS (f1 , L1(p) , v1 ) as in 4.12.6. Using the same argument as the one of 4.12.6.1 handling the general form of its Fact, we can assume\nad\n2ad\n2ad\ngR\nis of the form g1 gR\n, with gR\nliftable to an R-valued element gR of Gder\n1R conad\ngruent to the identity modulo the ideal (x1 , ..., xm) of R and with g1 \u2208 GW (k) (W (k)).\nUsing this we deduce the existence of a principally quasi-polarized p-divisible object\nC = (M1 \u2297W (k) R, F11 \u2297W (k) R, gR (\u03c61 \u2297 1), (v1\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J \u2032 , \u03c8\u0303) with tensors of MF[0,1] (R) as\nin 4.12.18 (the index 0 being replaced by 1), and whose attached Shimura adjoint Lie\nF -crystal is isomorphic to the one of the above answer. We can assume the Shimura\nfiltered \u03c3k -crystal (M1 , F11 , \u03c61 , G1W (k) , (v1\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J \u2032 ) is attached to a W (k)-valued point\nz1 of N1 , cf. 4.12.6. As in 4.12.18, 3.6.18.7.1 a) allows us to assume the existence of\na G1W (k) -invariant connection on M1 \u2297W (k) R making C to be viewed as a principally\n\u2207\nquasi-polarized p-divisible object with tensors of MF[0,1]\n(R). So the answer follows by\npassage to associated Shimura adjoint F -crystals, once we remark (cf. 2.2.21 UP and the\nFact 4 of 2.3.11 applied to (f1 , L1(p) , v1 )) that C is obtained via pull back from a uni plus\n \u0303 (v1\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J \u2032 ).\nversal Shimura filtered F -crystal of the form (M1 , F11 , \u03c61 , G1W (k) , N1 , f,\n\n4.12.16-18 admit a non-filtered version (cf. 2.2.1.6). Not to be too long this is not\ngoing to be presented here.\n4.12.20. Exercise. State and prove the analogues of 4.12.14-15 and 4.12.17-18 for\np = 2. Hint: just use 2.3.18, 3.14 B and 4.12.12.1.\n4.12.21. General (integral) Manin problems. Given an arbitrary Z(p) -scheme\nY we would like to understand which principally quasi-polarized p-divisible groups (resp.\nwhich isogeny classes of principally quasi-polarized p-divisible groups) over Y are coming\n551\n\n\ffrom principally polarized abelian schemes (resp. from isogeny classes of principally\npolarized abelian schemes) over Y of relative dimension e. This forms the general integral\nManin problem (resp. the general Manin problem) for the Siegel modular variety of\n4.12.4. Similarly we can define the general (integral) Manin problem for an arbitrary\nSHS (f, L(p) , v): we need to replace p-divisible groups by Shimura p-divisible groups (see\n2.2.20; in \u00a75-10 we will gradually extend the referred definition: we will define Shimura\np-divisible groups over any O(v) -scheme). We can also define the general (integral) Manin\nproblem in the context of 4.12.3: again 4.9.20 can be extended to any O(v) -scheme (see\n\u00a75 for details).\nA general (integral) Manin problem looks very hard in such a generality. In the\ncases when we are dealing with (the p-adic completion of) a (regular, formally) smooth,\nseparated scheme Y (over DVR's of index of ramification 1 over Z(p) or O(v) ) we hope\nthat some partial solutions can be obtained based on 3.6.\n4.13. Local forms of the invariance principle. There are two main local forms\nof this principle: one in the adjoint context and one in the context of Shimura p-divisible\ngroups; their proofs are very much the same and so they are combined. Let p \u2265 3 be a\nrational prime.\nWe start with the first form. Let (Gi , Xi , Hi , vi ), i = 1, 2, be two Shimura quadruples of preabelian type, with vi dividing p. Let Ni be the integral canonical model of\n(Gi , Xi , Hi , vi ). Let H0i \u2282 Gi (Apf ) be a subgroup such that either p|t(Gad\ni ) and H0i \u00d7 Hi\nad\nis a subgroup of Gi (Af ) p-smooth for (Gi , Xi ) or p does not divide t(Gi ) and H0i \u00d7 Hi\nis smooth for (Gi , Xi ) (cf. AE.4.2 a)). Let yi : Spec(k) \u2192 Nik /H0i , i = 1, 2, be such that\nthe non-trivial part of the Shimura adjoint Lie \u03c3k -crystal attached to y1 is isomorphic\nto the non-trivial part of the Shimura adjoint Lie \u03c3k -crystal attached to y2 . We fix such\nan isomorphism I. Let Oyi be the local ring of yi (in NiW (k) /H0i ) and let Oyh\u2227\nbe the\ni\nad\np-adic completion of its henselization. We assume k = k\u0304. Let Cyi be the Shimura adjoint\nfiltered Lie F -crystal over O(p)hyi := Oyh\u2227\n/pOyh\u2227\nattached (see 4.9.20) to the canonical\ni\ni\nh\u2227\nmorphism Spec(Oyi ) \u2192 NiW (k) /H0i . Let\nCnt\nyi\nbe its non-trivial part (it is defined as in 3.10.1; it is a direct factor of Cad\nyi ). The refined\ncanonical Lie stratification of Nik(vi ) makes Spec(O(p)hyi ) to be a stratified scheme.\nLet n \u2208 N. We have:\n4.13.1. Theorem. There is an isomorphism\nh\u2227\n\u03c1 : Spec(Oyh\u2227\n)\u2192Spec(O\n \u0303\ny2 )\n1\n\ninducing an isomorphism\nh\n\u03c1(p) : Spec(O(p)hy1 )\u2192Spec(O(p)\n \u0303\ny2 )\n\n552\n\n\fn nt\nnt\nn nt\nof stratified schemes and such that \u03c1\u2217 (Cnt\ny2 /p Cy2 ) is isomorphic to Cy1 /p Cy1 , through\nan isomorphism respecting the Lie structures and lifting I mod pn .\n\nWe present now the second form. Let (f i , Li(p) , v i ), i = 1, 2, be two standard Hodge\nsituations. Using the standard notations of 2.3.1-3 for the SHS (f i , Li(p) , v i ) but putting\neverywhere an upper right index i, let yi : Spec(k) \u2192 Nki /H0i be a morphism. Here k is\nan arbitrary perfect field containing k(v 1 ) and k(v 2 ). We assume H0i is small enough so\nthat all Hodge cycles of Ai are as well Hodge cycles of AiH i . We have:\n0\n\n4.13.2. Theorem. We assume the principally quasi-polarized Shimura \u03c3k -crystal\nattached to y1 is isomorphic to the principally quasi-polarized Shimura \u03c3k -crystal attached\nto y2 . We fix such an isomorphism I. Then there is an isomorphism\nh\u2227\n\u03c1 : Spec(Oyh\u2227\n)\u2192Spec(O\n \u0303\ny2 )\n1\n\ninducing an isomorphism\nh\n \u0303\n\u03c1(p) : Spec(O(p)hy1 )\u2192Spec(O(p)\ny2 )\n\nof stratified schemes and such that the pull back through \u03c1, of the crystalline counterpart\nof the kernel of the multiplication by pn of the principally quasi-polarized Shimura pdivisible group Dy2 over Spec(Oyh2 ) obtained from the principally quasi-polarized Shimura\np-divisible group over N 2 /H02 (see Fact 3 of 2.3.11) by pull back through the canonical\nmorphism Spec(Oyh2 ) \u2192 N 2 /H02 , is isomorphic to the crystalline counterpart of the kernel\nof the multiplication by pn of the principally quasi-polarized Shimura p-divisible group Dy1\nover Spec(Oyh1 ), defined similarly as Dy2 (here Oyhi , O(p)hyi have the same meaning as in\n4.13.1), through an isomorphism lifting I mod pn .\nProofs: In connection to 4.13.1 we refer to definitions 4.9.17 and 4.9.20 (in the case\nof a SHS, 4.9.20 is trivial, just introducing some terminology). For the parts involving\nstratifications, we just need to take n big enough and to apply 3.15.7 BP1. So 4.13.1-2 are\na direct consequence of (the second variant of) 3.6.14.4 (for 4.13.1 the passage from Lie\nalgebras of reductive groups to Lie algebras of their adjoints, in the context of crystalline\ncounterparts, is entirely trivial).\n4.13.3. Remarks. 1) The form of 4.13.2, with n = \u221e, where instead of taking\nhenselization we take the completion, was obtained previously: the Serre\u2013Tate's deformation theory implies this form for a standard PEL situation; the general case can be\nobtained by just copying [Va2, 5.4].\n2) The condition k = k\u0304 in 4.13.1 can be weaken: see \u00a75 (cf. 4.9.20).\n3) We have variants of 4.13.1-2, where instead of refined canonical Lie stratifications,\nwe use its variants listed in 4.9.9.\n4.14. Final remarks. Here we include some remarks which are sort of overview of\ngreat parts of [Va2] and of this paper.\n553\n\n\f4.14.1. The generic approach. Many results presented here or in [Va2] are trivial\nor very easy, from the generic point of view, i.e. working with a prime p big enough. But\nthe main inconvenience of this simple approach is that we do not have at all effective\nupper bounds (of how big p has to be); so, from the point of view of concreteness, it is\nvoid. We now list some results which generically \"are very easy\" and motivate why this\nis so.\na) [Va2, 3.4.1 and 3.4.7] is all we need to get generically the existence of integral\ncanonical models of Shimura varieties of Hodge type.\nb) [Va2, 6.2.2 a), 6.2.3 and 6.8] is all we need to extend this to Shimura varieties of\npreabelian type.\nc) [Va2, 6.4.4 and 6.4.11] generically are obvious.\nd) The density part of 4.2.1 is obvious generically (due to the existence of smooth\ntoroidal compactifications of canonical models of Shimura varieties and of c)).\ne) Using [Va2, 3.2.11] and d) we get (via 3.1.0 a) and c)) the generic form of 4.2.1\nitself.\nf ) Using [Va2, 3.2.11] and d), 4.6 P1 is obvious generically.\nFor e) and f) cf. also the proof of 4.12.12 or cf. 4.12.12.6.\n4.14.2. The special type case. There are plenty of generalized Shimura (filtered)\nF -crystals and of Shimura (filtered) Lie F -crystals involving the E6 , E7 and Dnmixed\ntypes (see 3.6.1.6 and 3.10.5 for terminology). So, even before the proof of the existence\nof integral canonical models of Shimura varieties of special type and of the validity of\nthe expectation of [Va2, a) and b) of 3.2.7 8)] (in loc. cit., strictly speaking just a\nvariant of [Va2, 5.6.5 f)] is satisfied, cf. 2.2.8 3) and the beginning paragraph of 3.4;\nsee also AE.0), we can speak about stratifications (as in 4.5) of schemes of moduli of\nShimura (adjoint) filtered Lie F -crystals (often attached to generalized Shimura filtered\nF -crystals) of special type. For the study of these stratifications we refer to [Va6]. Here\nwe just mention two things:\n1) All formulas of 4.5.15.2 hold for the generalized Shimura context, whenever we\nhave global deformations which are uni plus versal; based on 3.15.6 D (such deformations\ndo exist and moreover) the arguments of 4.5.15.2.5 need no modification at all.\n2) All of 4.7.11 and of 4.7.12-17 (as well as their p = 2 version; see 4.14.3 E below)\ncan be entirely adapted to the generalized Shimura context (again, based on 3.15.6 D\nand E no modification of arguments are needed; 3.15.6 B shows that even the part of\n4.7.11 6) referring to [Ka4, A2.2 (2)] can be entirely adapted). In particular, the third\nparagraph of 4.7.11 2A) can be performed without any reference (via some lifting process)\nto p-divisible groups.\n4.14.3. The case of a p = 2 SHS. From 2.3.18 and 3.14 we get that most of the\nresults of 4.1-13 remain true for a p = 2 SHS (f, L(2) , v) (see also [Va5]). However some\nof them need some reformulation: below we refer to such a p = 2 SHS. Warning: below\nwe do not always state explicitly at each step the implicit references to 3.14.\n554\n\n\fA. All results of 4.1-3 remain true: no extra reformulation is needed (cf. 3.14 C).\nWarning: 4.2.8.1* remains true (the argument of [Va2, 6.4.1.1 2)] applies for p = 2 as\nwell) in the compact type case but we can not say presently anything very precise about\nnon-compact type cases. Also, the quadratic form in two variables of the proof of Fact 2\nof 4.3.6, has to be replaced by x21 + x1 x2 + \u03b1x22 , where \u03b1 \u2208 k\u0303 is such that the equation\nx2 + x + \u03b1 has no roots in k\u0303.\nB. 4.4.1 1) and 3) as well as b), c) and d) of 4.4.1 2) remain true without any\nmodification. We do expect that d) of 4.4.1 3) and 4.4.12 also hold. But b) of 4.4.1 2)\nand its version for U -ordinary points (see 4.4.13.1 d)) as well as 4.4.8 1) and 3) need\nsubstantial reformulation.\nAs G-canonical lifts for p \u2265 3 were defined at the level of filtrations in the crystalline\ncohomology context (cf. a) of 4.4.1 2)), for p = 2, for their (desired) uniqueness (and the\nparts of 4.4-11 involving it, like 4.4.5-6) we have to proceed very carefully, cf. 2.3.18.1.\nB1. As a first warning, using the existence of (to be mentioned in E below) Gcrystalline (additive or multiplicative) coordinates we get:\nWarning. For any k-valued G-ordinary point y of Nk(v) , denoting its attached\nShimura \u03c3k -crystal by (My , \u03c6y , GW (k) ), a lift z : Spec(W (k)) \u2192 MW (k(v)) of y (viewed\nas a k-valued point of Mk(v) ) such that (My , F01 , \u03c6y , GW (k) ), with (My , F01 , \u03c6y , pMy ) as\nthe principally quasi-polarized filtered \u03c3k -crystal attached to z, is a Shimura filtered \u03c3k crystal, does not necessarily factor through NW (k(v)) .\nEasy examples can be obtained with G a torus or starting from 4.14.3.1 below.\nSo even if k(v) = F2 (i.e. even when we can use 4.6 P1 cf. D below), we can not\nget (at least theoretically) the uniqueness part by specifying that we choose the usual\ncanonical lift.\nWe explain the situation, in the slightly more general case when k(v ad ) = F2 . We use\nthe notations and terminology of 4.7.0, 4.7.8 and 4.7.11 1). The formal moduli scheme of\nG-deformations of (Ay , pAy ) can be naturally identified with a closed formal subscheme\nof the formal torus (see E below) of deformations of the 2-divisible group Dy1 (of 4.7.11\n1)). This formal subscheme is the translation of a formal subtorus by a 2-torsion point\nP2\u2212tor : this is nothing else but the p = 2 analogue of 4.7.17 (cf. also E below). This\nformal subtorus is uniquely determined but not P2\u2212tor , provided it is non-zero. So if\nP2\u2212tor is the identity element, then we can define the G-canonical lift of y uniquely but\nnot otherwise. We do not know when such a 2-torsion point is not the identity; we just\npoint out that this problem is very much related to variants of Milne's conjecture of\n1.15.1. In \u00a75 and \u00a76 we will prove, using such variants of Milne's conjecture, that in\nmany situations such a torsion point is the identity.\nSo, in general, we have to allow either a finite number of such G-canonical lifts or\nto try to use something else. The most logical \"something else\" would be to use 3.14 I;\nhowever, as pointed out in the above paragraph, without quite a lot of work, we can not\ncheck that we can apply 3.14 I in our geometric contexts of p = 2 SHS's.\n555\n\n\fAs a second warning we have: some G-canonical lifts might be defined only up to\npassage from k to an abelian extension whose Galois group is a subgroup of (Z/2Z)m , with\nm \u2208 N, m \u2264 dimC (S), cf. the proof of 2.3.18.1 B and its logical variant in the principally\nquasi-polarized context. It can checked that m \u2264 dimC (X) (the case k(v ad ) = Fp can be\ndeduced from 2.3.18.1.1 and the above part on 2-torsion points; the general case can be\ndeduced by adapting the proof of B2 below: see also the Exercise 4.14.3.1 below).\nPresently we do not know what in general would be the most practical \"something\nelse\". For instance, we could try to choose one such G-canonical lift to which a \"bigger\"\n(or specified) part of the Z-Lie algebra of G-endomorphisms (or of the Z-algebra of\nendomorphisms or of the group of G-automorphisms or of automorphisms) of Ay , lifts, or\n(this seems the easiest way) in terms of 2-divisible groups (i.e. of Galois representations\nwith Z2 -coefficients); in case k is not 1-simply connected, we could try to specify that\nthe G-canonical lift has to be defined over W (k), etc.\nHowever we do have:\nB2. Proposition. If the Lie p-rank p \u2212 LieG (y) (see 4.3.8 1)) is 0 (i.e. if each\npoint of Nk(v) with values in a field is non-integral in the sense of 4.12.12.6.5), then we\ncan define a unique G-canonical lift of y.\nProof: We refer again to the direct sum decomposition My = My1 \u2295 My2 of 4.7.11 1);\nso in what follows N and N0 are defined as in 4.7.1. We have a direct sum decomposition\nEnd(My ) = End(My1 ) \u2295 Hom(My1 , My2 ) \u2295 Hom(My2 , My1 ) \u2295 End(My2 ).\nFrom 3.14 I we get that the F 1 -filtration F 1 of My defined by any G-canonical lift z\nof y can be similarly decomposed as F 1 = F11 \u2295 F21 , with Fj1 \u2282 Myj , j = 1, 2. So we\nhave a direct sum decomposition of F 0 (End(M )) in four direct summands similar to the\none of End(M ). Accordingly, the moduli scheme Spec(R) of deformations of Dy1 \u2295 Dy2 is\n\"decomposed into four pieces\". Using the language of homomorphisms of W (k)-algebras,\nby this we mean: there are natural W (k)-epimorphisms qi : R \u0589 Ri , i = 1, 4, with\nR, R1 ,..., R4 as W (k)-algebras of formal power series, such that the tangent space of\nSpec(R) is a direct sum of the images (via these W (k)-epimorphisms) of the tangent\nspaces of Spec(Ri ), i = 1, 4; q1 is defined by the moduli scheme of deformations of Dy1 ,\nq4 is defined by the moduli scheme of deformations of Dy2 , etc. Here, as well as in what\nfollows, the tangent spaces are defined w.r.t. the W (k)-epimorphism R \u0589 W (k) defining\nthe trivial deformation of Dz1 \u2295 Dz2 and factoring through qi , i = 1, 4; Dzi is a fixed lift of\nDyi , i = 1, 2, such that the p-divisible group of z \u2217 (A) is naturally decomposed as a direct\nsum Dz1 \u2295 Dz2 (cf. also 2.3.18.1.1).\nWe can view these four pieces also as projections. To exemplify it, we concentrate on\nthe first factor corresponding to q1 . We first consider a complete, local W (k)-subalgebra\nR4 of R generated by W (k) and by a maximal set of regular parameters of R belonging to\nthe kernel of q4 , then we consider a complete, local W (k)-subalgebra R34 of R4 generated\nby W (k) and by a maximal set of regular parameters of R4 belonging to the kernel of the\nnatural W (k)-epimorphism R4 \u0589 R3 defined by q3 , and then we consider a complete,\n556\n\n\flocal W (k)-subalgebra R234 of R34 generated by W (k) and by a maximal set of regular\nparameters of R34 belonging to the kernel of the natural W (k)-epimorphism R34 \u0589 R2\ndefined by q2 . The composite q 1 : R234 \u2192 R1 of the W (k)-monomorphism R234 \u0592\u2192 R\nwith q1 , is a W (k)-isomorphism.\nLet Oy be the local ring of y, viewed as a k-valued point of NW (k) ; we view it\nas a W (k)-algebra. The hypothesis p \u2212 LieG (y) = 0 gets translated in: Lie(N ) has a\ntrivial projection on End(My1 ); so also Lie(N0 ) has a trivial projection on End(My1 ). We\ncy ) is\nfirst consider the particular case when Lie(N ) \u2282 End(My2 ). In this case, as Spec(O\n2\n1\nintegral, we are just deforming Dz , while fixing Dz and so 2.3.18.1 C applies directly.\n\nWe now come back to the general case. We assume the existence of another W (k)valued point z1 (different from z) of NW (k) lifting y and whose attached Shimura filtered\n\u03c3k -crystal is (My , F 1 , \u03c6y , GW (k) ). From 2.3.18.1.1 (cf. also E below) we get that it\ncorresponds to (i.e. it is defined by) a 2-torsion point of the formal torus of deformations\nof Dy1 . So, from the point of view of the moduli scheme of deformations of Dy1 \u2295 Dy2 ,\nit is defined by a W (k)-valued point of Spec(R) factoring through Spec(R1 ). So, as the\n2-torsion points are \"recorded\" by the tangent space of Spec(R1 ), the tangent map of the\ncy ) \u2192\nW (k)-morphism obtained by composing the natural W (k)-morphism my : Spec(O\n234\nSpec(R) with the natural W (k)-morphism Spec(R) \u2192 Spec(R ), is non-trivial. But\nthis contradicts the mentioned trivial projection (the image of the Kodaira\u2013Spencer map\nnaturally associated to my can be identified with a direct summand of Lie(N0 ), cf. 4.7.2\nand its logical p = 2 version). This proves the Proposition.\nB3. B2 applies entirely to U -canonical lifts. So in 4.9.17.5 we do not get the\nuniqueness of U -canonical lifts of U -ordinary points (in G below we do not repeat this).\nSo 4.4.8 1) and 3) have to be modified as well. However, the above part on the uniqueness\nof G-canonical lifts applies as well to non-integral, U -ordinary points; so Proposition of\nB2 points out the following thing: for p = 2 it is easier to understand U -canonical lifts\nof U -ordinary points which in some sense are far from being ordinary.\nMoreover, we have:\nCorollary. We consider a quasi-pivotal point y \u2208 Nk(v) (k). Then any W (k)-valued\npoint z of N lifting y is uniquely determined by the Hodge filtration Fz1 of My defined by\nz \u2217 (A).\nProof: The proof of B2 takes care of the case when the Shimura filtered \u03c3k -crystal\n(My , Fz1 , \u03c6y , GW (k) ) attached to z is cyclic diagonalizable. It is the Claim of 2.4.1 which\nallows us to pass the uniqueness to any mentioned z. This ends the proof.\nB4. Also 4.4.4 has to be modified, in case a G-canonical lift is not uniquely determined by its filtration in the crystalline cohomology context. The easiest way:\nCorollary. Referring to the notations of 4.4.4 we have:\n4EndG (Ay ) \u2282 EndG (Az )\n557\n\n\fand the elements of AutG (Ay ) which restricted to Ay [4] are identity, are also elements of\nAutG (Az ).\nProof: This is a consequence of Serre\u2013Tate's deformation theory.\nAccordingly, 4.4.5-6 remain true. The rest, i.e. 4.4.7 and 4.4.9-12, does not need\nmodifications.\nC. 4.5 involves just Newton polygons, parabolic groups and Shimura (adjoint Lie) F crystals; so it needs no modification at all besides the fact that the split group\nPnof Bn (resp.\n2\nof Dn ) P\nLie type of 4.5.6.1 has to be defined using the quadratic form x0 + i=1 x2i\u22121 x2i\nn\n(resp.\ni=1 x2i\u22121 x2i ), to be compared with 2.3.18 B2. For the fact that all of 4.5.15.2\nremains true for p = 2, cf. 2.3.18 and 3.14 C and J. It seems to us that the automorphism\ninvariants of 4.5.15.3 have \"jumps\" in the case p = 2 provided we are dealing with the\nBn and the Cn Lie types with n \u2265 2 (cf. the special cases in [BT, 4.2.3]; see also 3.5.4\nand 3.14 C and end of J). Here by \"jumps\" we mean: irregular behavior (unpredictable\nby looking just at odd primes).\nD. Modulo some modifications, the part of 4.6 till 4.6.3 inclusive, except the parts\nof 4.6 P2 and 4.6.3 A referring to canonical lifts, remains true without modifications. In\n4.6.1 1) (resp. in connection to 4.6 P8), for p = 2 we presently need to restrict to the\nC1 (resp. to the Al ) Lie type. Out of 4.6.2, only 4.6.2.2 and 4.6.2.6 make any sense\nfor p = 2. Moreover, P2 and 4.6.3 A can be modified as follows: any abelian variety\nover W (k\u0304) obtained via a W (k\u0304)-valued G-canonical lift of N , is isogeneous to the (usual)\ncanonical lift of its special fibre (see 2.3.18.1 E).\nWarning: Exercise 4.6.4 A remains true (cf. its first proof) for p = 2; but (presently)\nit does not lead to the construction of integral canonical models of (some) Shimura\nvarieties of preabelian type which are not of abelian type (cf. the limitations of [Va2,\n6.8.1]). 4.6.4 B makes no sense for p = 2. 4.6.5 can be checked in many situations (see\n\u00a75, \u00a76 and [Va5]) but for its complete p = 2 analogue we have to postpone to [Va3]. 4.6.6\nholds for p = 2 standard PEL situations (cf. b) of 2.3.18 B3: the argument pertaining\nto B(F)- and W (F)-valued points of 4.6.6 holds for p = 2 as well); so d) of 4.4.1 3) holds\nfor all p = 2 standard PEL situations of 2.3.18 B.\nLemma of 4.6.7 holds for p = 2. So 3.14 J implies that 4.6.7-8 applies for p = 2 as\nfar as 4.14.4.1.1 and 4.14.4.1.2 2) below allow. More precisely, the first part of Corollary\n1 (resp. of Corollary 3) of 4.6.7 does hold for p = 2, as [Va2, 6.5-6] can be performed\nabstractly, with no reference to p = 2 SHS's (resp. as we have 2.3.18 B and Lemma 2\nof 4.6.4; see also 4.14.4.1.1); moreover, Corollary 2 of 4.6.7 holds for p = 2 for the An ,\nand the totally non-compact Cn and DnH types (of 3.10.5); for the totally non-compact\nCn and DnH types, cf. also 4.14.4.1.2 2).\nIn connection to the Bn and DnR types, 4.6.8 for p = 2 has to be interpreted just in\nterms of principally quasi-polarized Shimura F -crystals, with no reference to a SHS.\nE. Related to 4.7 there are just three things to be modified. First, part of [De3, 1.4.2]\nand of [Ka4, A2.2] are dealing just with odd primes; so to get 4.7.5 we have to proceed\n558\n\n\fas explained in 4.7.11 (see 2) and 4) of it especially: they handle the case p = 2 as well).\nSecond, in 4.7.8 the unit element can correspond to any one of the G-canonical lifts of\ny. Accordingly, in 4.11.8 (as well as in geometric variants of the end of 4.7.11 8) and of\n4.7.17) we have to speak not about formal subtori but about the translate of a formal\nsubtorus by a 2-torsion point. Moreover, in 4.7.11 2) for p = 2, we define q : Rm \u2192 Rn\nto be a maximal formally smooth quotient of Rm preserving the tensors involved (i.e. we\nare in a universal context as of 2.2.21). Similarly, qn,r of 4.7.11 9) is uniquely determined\nup to translation with a 2-torsion point.\nThird, [Og, 3.14] implies that in the part of 4.7.11 8) referring to Theorem of 4.7.11\n4), with p = 2, the Frobenius lift \u03a6Rn of Rn which makes gRn to be the identity element,\nis not unique; we recall n = dimW (k) (\u00d1 ). We have:\nFact. The number of such Frobenius lifts is precisely 2n , and so it is finite.\nProof: Referring to the last paragraph of 4.7.11 6), we choose (as in 3.6.18.2 in the\ncontext where all bijl 's are 0) a connection \u2207 on M\u0303 \u2297W (k) Rn which is of the form\n\u03b4+\n\nn\nX\n\nxi ai dzi ,\n\ni=1\n\nwith \u03b4 the connection that annihilates M\u0303 and with xi \u2208 Rn such that the Kodaira\u2013\nSpencer map of \u2207 is injective modulo the maximal ideal of Rn ; for the convenience of\nthe computations we assume xi = zi1+1 (cf. (24) of 3.6.18.2 and (LN) of 4.7.11 6)) and\nthat \u03c6\u0303(pai ) = ai , \u2200i \u2208 S(1, n), cf. end of 4.7.11 6). So xi dzi = d(ln(zi + 1)). Such a\nconnection allows us to treat the situation as if n = 1: as the product of any two elements\nof Lie(\u00d1 ), viewed as endomorphisms of M\u0303 , is 0, based on [Og, 3.14], we get immediately\nthat the number of Frobenius lifts of Rn which makes gRn to be the identity element is\nat least 2n . All such lifts are obtained (cf. loc. cit.) by mapping for i running through\nan arbitrary subset of S(1, n), zi + 1 into \u2212(zi + 1)2 (and not into (zi + 1)2 ).\nTo check that the number of Frobenius lifts of Rn which makes gRn to be the identity\nelement is precisely 2n we just need to remark the following two things:\na) \u03a6Rn is uniquely determined by its Teichm\u00fcller lift Spec(W (k)) \u0592\u2192 Spec(Rn ), i.e.\nthere is no Frobenius lift of Rn different from \u03a6Rn which makes gRn to be the identity\nelement and whose Teichm\u00fcller lift Spec(W (k)) \u0592\u2192 Spec(Rn ) is the same as of \u03a6Rn ;\nb) any Teichm\u00fcller lift as in a) defines a 2-torsion point of the n dimensional formal\ntorus Spf(Rn ).\nWe first argue b). Using a direct sum decomposition M\u0303 = M\u03031 \u2295 M\u03032 as in 4.7.11 1), we\ncan replace M\u0303 by M\u03031 . So, using the p = 2 variant of 4.7.17, we can assume G\u0303 = GL(M\u0303 )\nand this last case is well known (see 2.3.18.1 B and 2.3.18.1.1). The argument for a) goes\nas follows. Due to the injectivity of the Kodaira\u2013Spencer map, any such Frobenius lift\n\u03a61Rn has to be of essentially multiplicative type and so (cf. 3.6.18.1.1) of multiplicative\ntype. So, as in the part of 4.7.11 8) referring to \"up to an isomorphism\", we can assume\nthe existence of z\u0303i \u2208 Rn , \u2200i \u2208 S(1, n), such that:\n559\n\n\f\u2013 \u03a61Rn (z\u0303i + 1) = (z\u0303i + 1)2 , \u2200i \u2208 S(1, n);\n\u2013 Rn = W (k)[[z\u03031 , ..., z\u0303n]];\n\u2013 z\u0303i \u2208 (z1 , ..., zn), \u2200i \u2208 S(1, n) (here is the place where the part on Teichm\u00fcller lifts\nis used);\n\u2013 w.r.t. z\u0303i 's, \u2207 gets the same logarithmic form as above.\nFrom 2.2.21 UP we get that the W (k)-isomorphism of Rn that takes zi into z\u0303i is the\nidentity isomorphism, and so \u03a61Rn is not different from \u03a6Rn . This proves the Fact.\nIn another order of ideas, the uniqueness part of [Og, 3.15] for p = 2 is a consequence\nof 2.3.18.1 C.\nF. The whole of 4.8 remains true for p = 2, as Fontaine's comparison theory with\nrational coefficients is still true in the case of good reduction and mixed characteristic\n(0, 2), see [Fa1-2]. This is the reason we stated 4.8 in terms of Qp -valued points (however,\nsee 4.8.3 f) and the involved 2.3.18.1 E).\nG. Also 4.9 can be adapted to a great extend to the case of a p = 2 SHS (f, L(2), v).\nThe limitations are as follows. First, in 4.14.3.2 below we include just p = 2 versions of\n[Va2, 6.2.2] and not of [Va2, 6.1.1]. Second, we keep quiet (i.e. we postpone a precise\nstatement, till B1 is \"sorted out\" fully) regarding the fact that (f4 , L1 (2) \u2295 L2 (2) , v4 ) is\nor is not a p = 2 SHS; accordingly we keep quiet about a p = 2 analogue of 4.9.20.\nSo we get 4.9.8 using just: integral canonical models of Shimura quadruples having\nthe same adjoint as the Shimura quadruple (G, X, H, v) (underlying (f, L(2), v)), involving reductive groups over Q whose derived subgroups are quotients of Gder , and whose\nexistence is guaranteed by 4.14.3.2.1 below; warning: 4.9.8 can be worked out just in a rational context (i.e. working with Shimura isocrystals attached to points). Unfortunately,\nfor the variants of 4.9.8 listed in 4.9.9, the rational approach is not enough (except for the\ncase of the canonical Lie stratifications and, when appropriate, of \u03c1-stratifications). Also,\nin connection to 4.9.10-13 and 4.9.19-21 we have to deal only with such types of integral\ncanonical models. Moreover, in connection to 4.9.20-21, due to limitations of 4.14.4.1 b)\nbelow, often we need to state explicitly that we assume N is a pro-\u00e9tale cover of N /H0 .\n4.9.14-6 and 4.9.17.0 hold for the case of a p = 2 SHS. Warning: based on reasons\nexplained in B1-2, the toric points of 4.9.17.3 can not be always defined for p = 2 in terms\nof Galois representations. The notions of 4.9.21 make sense for p = 2. 4.9.21.1 holds for\np = 2 as far as allowed by 4.14.4.1.1 and by 4.14.4.1.2 2) below. 4.9.23 does not pertain\nto a fixed prime.\nH. 4.10 holds for p = 2, provided we use integral canonical models N of the type\nmentioned in G (i.e. are constructed via 4.14.3.2.1 below, etc.).\nI. No modifications are needed to 4.11 (except referring in 4.11.1 to 2.2.1.5.1 instead\nof [Va2, 3.2.7 4)]); due to reasons explained in 4.14.3 B1, presently 4.11.1.1 and 4.11.2-4\nhave to be interpreted in a sense which allows a finite number of G-canonical lifts of a\nG-ordinary point.\n560\n\n\fJ. Related to 4.12 see 4.12.12.1-2 and 4.12.20. In connection to 4.12.12.6, 4.12.12.6.1,\n4.12.12.6.2 B, 4.12.12.6.3, 4.12.12.6.4 and 4.12.12.6.4.1-2 we presently assume (cf. the\nlimitations of the rational approach of paragraph G) that (G, X, H, v) = (G1 , X1 , H1 , v1 )\nand that we are in a context where X\u03c9poss = X, \u2200\u03c9 \u2208 WG : it is 4.12.12.6.0 2) which\nallows us to always assume this second part.\nIn particular, based on 4.12.12.6.0 2), the following sections 4.12.12.6.2, 4.12.12.6.2 B,\n4.12.12.6.3, 4.12.12.6.4 and 4.12.12.6.4.1-2 hold as well for a p = 2 standard PEL situation.\nMoreover, the Corollary of 4.12.12.6.4 and 4.12.12.6.4.3 hold under no restriction for\np = 2, as their arguments involve just Weyl elements and Newton polygons. 4.12.15 and\n4.12.18 hold for a p = 2 SHS (as the Theorem of 2.3.11 does).\nK. The second variant of 3.6.14.4 can be entirely adapted for p = 2, by just working\nin the context of Shimura F -crystals. So 4.13.1-2 remain true without any modification\nexcept the one (see end of G): often we need to state explicitly that we assume Ni is a\npro-\u00e9tale cover of Ni /H0i , i = 1, 2. Accordingly, in connection to 4.13.2 we do not need\nto assume that there is a W (k)-valued point zi of Ni lifting yi , i = 1, 2, such that the\nprincipally quasi-polarized Shimura 2-divisible groups over W (k) obtained by pull backs\nvia z1 and z2 , are isomorphic: based on the surjectivity part of the Claim of 2.4.1, it is\nenough to start with z1 and z2 such their attached principally quasi-polarized Shimura\nfiltered \u03c3k -crystals are isomorphic.\n4.14.3.1. Exercise. We refer to 2.4.1. Show that the number of points of each fibre\ns(\u22121)\nof mG\nand at the most 2dd((M,\u03c6,G)) . Here s(\u22121) is the number of\nD (k) is at least 2\nslopes \u22121 of the Shimura Lie \u03c3-crystal attached to (M, \u03c6, G). Hints: for the at least part,\nuse the p = 2 variant of 4.7.11 9); for the at most part use first a similar specialization\nargument as in 2.3.18.1 B to reduce the situation to a Shimura-ordinary F -crystal over\nk and then use 2.3.18.1.1 and arguments at the level of dimensions of k-vector spaces.\n4.14.3.2. The passage from the Hodge type to the abelian type. We follow\nvery closely [Va2, 6.2.2] and its corrections of AE.4 and AE.4.1. We start with the\nsituation of [Va2, 6.2.1]. Let f : (G, X) \u2192 (G1 , X1 ) be a cover such that E(G, X) =\nE(G1 , X1 ). We consider a map (G, X, H, v) \u2192 (G1 , X1 , H1 , v) defined by f between two\nShimura quadruples, with v a prime of E(G, X) dividing a rational prime p = 2. As\nusual F = k(v)).\nDue to 2.2.1.4, the proof of [Va2, 6.2.3] holds for p = 2: the only place where we\nused the fact that we were dealing with odd primes in the mentioned proof, was in the\nconstruction of a Galois-descent datum; but 2.2.1.4 guarantees that this datum can still\nbe constructed for p = 2.\n[Va2, 6.2.2 a)] for p = 2 does apply only to the E6 and A2n Lie types, with n \u2208 N,\ncf. also [Va2, 6.4.6 6)] and AE.4.2. Accordingly, in Lemma 3 of 4.6.4, the part \"2 times\"\ncan be removed. We have the following p = 2 analogue of [Va2, 6.2.2 b)]:\n4.14.3.2.1. Theorem. We assume the existence of a p = 2 SHS (f2 , L(2) , v2 ),\nad\nad ad\nad\nad\nad ad\nder\nsuch that (Gad\n= Gder\nand the centralizer of\n2 , X2 , H2 , v2 ) = (G1 , X1 , H1 , v1 ), G\n2\nGZ(2) in GL(L(2) ) is a reductive group (here we use the standard notations for (f2 , L(2) , v2 )\n561\n\n\fexcept that we put a lower right index 2 everywhere except for L(2) ). We also assume\nN2k(v2 ) has enough quasi-pivotal points, i.e. we assume each connected component of\nN2k(v2 ) has F-valued quasi-pivotal points. Then (G, X, H, v) and (G1 , X1 , H1 , v1 ) have\nintegral canonical models N and respectively N1 ; moreover, the natural morphism (cf.\n2.2.1.5.1) N \u2192 N1 is a pro-\u00e9tale cover.\nProof: The existence of N has been already argued. As N2 is a quasi-projective\nintegral model (in the sense of [Va2, 3.2.3 2')]; the argument is as in the proof of [Va2,\n6.4.2]), [Va2, 6.2.3] implies N is a quasi-projective integral model. To show that N1\nexists, we follow the proof of [Va2, 6.2.2 b)]: we construct N1 as the quotient of N via a\ngroup action of a pro-finite, abelian group which is an M -torsion group, for some M \u2208 N;\nhere we just mention that 2 does not divide M iff Gad has all its simple factors of some\nA2n Lie type, n \u2208 N (cf. also [Va2, 6.2.3.1]).\nAs any connected component C 0 of NW (F) can be identified with a connected component C2 of N2W (F) , the fact that N1 has the EP, follows once we show that the mentioned\ngroup action is free (cf. [Va2, 6.2.2 A) to D)]). We choose a connected component X 0\nof X. We can assume it is a connected component of X2 as well (cf. [Va2, 3.3.3]). We\ncan choose C 0 = C2 such its set of complex points contains those defined by equivalence\nclasses of the form [x, 1], x \u2208 X 0 . We follow entirely the pattern of AE.4.1. Let (G\u20322 , X2\u2032 ),\nh, y, GA, (Ay , pAy ), (A\u2032y , pA\u2032y ), M , a and aM have the same significance as in AE.4.1.\nWe assume h does not fix all geometric points of C2 . If y is a quasi-pivotal point, then\nwe reach a contradiction as in AE.4.1 (cf. 4.14.3 B3). So, based on our hypothesis on\nthe existence of quasi-pivotal points, we get that h does not act trivially on any connected component of C2F . If y is not a quasi-pivotal point, then as in AE.4.1 we get\nthat aM leaves invariant the F 1 -filtration of M defined by any W (F)-valued point z of\nC2 lifting y. Based on 2.3.5.6.1 B (INTR) (see also end of 2.3.18 A) and on the proof of\n2.4.2, we get that h acts trivially on the connected component of C2F to which y belongs.\nContradiction. This ends the proof.\nFor future references, we also mention here explicitly the following p = 2 version of\nthe corrected version of [Va2, 6.2.2.1] mentioned in the Proposition of AE.4. Let\ng \u2208 Aut(G2 , X2 , H2 ) \u2282 Aut(G2 )(Q)\nsuch that it takes X 0 into X 0 and normalizes a compact, open subgroup H02 of G2 (A2f ).\nSo g gives birth (via 2.2.1.5.1) to an automorphism ag of the image C2H02 of C2 into\nN2W (F) /H02 .\n4.14.3.2.2. Proposition. We assume the order of ag is finite. If ag acts freely on\nC2H02 but fixes an F-valued point y of it, then the power of p dividing the order of ag is\nbounded above independently of H02 and g.\nProof: Let g0 have the same significance as in [Va2, p. 495]; so it is an automorphism\nof the non-trivial factor of the Shimura adjoint Lie \u03c3F -crystal attached to y. Let z \u2208\nC2H02 (W (F)) be a lift of y and let Cz := (My , Fz1 , \u03c6, G2W (F)) be its attached Shimura\nfiltered \u03c3F -crystal. Let Spec(R) be the completion of the local ring of y and let Spec(R1 )\n562\n\n\fbe obtained as in 2.4, starting from Cz . From the Claim 2.4.1 and from 4.14.3.1 we get\nthat the W (F)-morphism F IL0 : Spec(RP D ) \u2192 Spec(R1P D ) is such that each W (F)valued point of Spec(R1P D ) lifts to precisely 2m W (F)-valued points of Spec(RP D ), where\nm \u2208 N \u222a {0} is at most dd((Cz )).\nWe can assume g0 has an order a power of p. As AE.6.1 points out, we can not\nalways argue immediately that g0 is an inner automorphism even if g is. However, as the\ngroup of outer automorphisms of any adjoint group over W (F) is finite, we get that there\nb(Gad\n2W (F) )\n\nis b(Gad\n2W (F) ) \u2208 N which does not depend on g or on H02 such that g0\n\nis an inner\n\nad\nb(Gad\n2W (F) )t(G2W (F) )\n\nis the identity automorphism. But this together\nautomorphism. So g0\nwith the existence of m implies that the order o of the W (F)-automorphism of Spec(R)\ndefined by ag is bounded above independently of H02 and g. We have (cf. 2.4.2):\nad\no \u2264 2b(Gad\n2W (F) )t(G2W (F) ).\n\nThis ends the proof.\n4.14.3.2.3. Back to 2.3.18 A. We use the notations of the beginning of 2.3.18. We\nassume the centralizer of GZ(2) in GL(L(2) ) is a reductive group. We also assume Nk(v)\nhas enough quasi-pivotal points; for instance, this is so if the connected components of NF\nare permuted transitively by G(Apf ), cf. 4.14.3 J (in particular, this applies if (G, X) is of\ncompact type). From 4.14.3.2.1 we get that N ad exists and moreover the O(v) -morphism\nqN (resp. qN1 ) obtained as in 2.3.3.2 (resp. as in 2.3.5.5) exists and is a pro-\u00e9tale cover\nof its image (resp. is a pro-\u00e9tale cover).\nSimilarly, Fact 2 of 2.3.5.2 holds for p = 2 due to the mentioned p = 2 version of\n[Va2, 6.2.3] (see 4.14.3.2).\n4.14.3.3. References for 1.13.4. 1.13.4 a) follows from 4.14.3 A and B. For 1.13.4\nb) cf. 4.14.3.2.1 (or 4.14.4.1.1 below). 1.13.4 c) (resp. d) follows from 4.14.3 C (resp. J).\n1.13.4 e) follows from 4.14.3 B and D.\n4.14.4. Generalized Serre lemma. 4.14.3.2.1-2 point out that [Va2, 6.4.6 6)]\nhas a version in mixed characteristic (0, 2). To state it as a Corollary, we need to adapt\nAE.4.2 and 4.4.13.5 to the context of 4.14.3.2.1.\nWe refer to the mentioned context. Due to the limitations of 4.14.3 G, here we\ndefine a non-integral, U -ordinary point of N1k(v1 ) to be a point with values in a field k1\nsuch that a G1 (A2f )-translate of it lifts, after potentially replacing k1 by k1 and identifying\nconnected components of NW (F) with ones of N2W (F) , to a non-integral, U -ordinary point\nof N2F . We have:\n4.14.4.1. Corollary. Let H01 be a compact subgroup of G1 (A2f ) such that H01 \u00d7 H1\nis smooth for (G1 , X1 ).\na) Then N1 is a pro-\u00e9tale cover of N1 /H01 \u00d7 H1 above all points of N1k(v1 ) which\nare non-integral, U -ordinary points.\n563\n\n\fb) We assume the centralizer of G2Z(2) in GL(L(2) ) is a reductive group over Z(2)\nand N2k(v2 ) has enough quasi-pivotal points. If H01 \u00d7 H1 is 2-smooth for (G1 , X1 ), then\nN1 is a pro-\u00e9tale cover of N1 /H01 \u00d7 H1 .\nProof: The proof of a) is entirely the same as 4.4.13.5, cf. 4.14.3 B3. b) is obtained\nfrom 4.14.3.2.1 in the same way (see 2.3.8.5) AE.4.2 b) was deduced from AE.4.1.\n4.14.4.1.1. A conclusion. The concrete conclusion of the methods developed\nabove in connection to the p = 2 theory of Shimura varieties, can be gathered in the\nfollowing particular case of 4.14.4.1 b):\nCorollary. We consider a Shimura quadruple (G1 , X1 , H1 , v1 ) of abelian type, with\nad\nv1 dividing 2. We assume each simple factor of (Gad\n1 , X1 ) is either of some An Lie type\nor is of some Cn or DnH type defined by an adjoint group whose extension to R has no\nsimple, compact factors. We consider a p = 2 standard PEL situation (f, L(2) , v, B)),\nad\nad ad\nwith (G, X, H, v) = (Gad\n1 , X1 , H1 , v1 ) (cf. Lemma 2 of 4.6.4 and the p = 2 version\n\u2013see 2.3.18 A\u2013 of 2.3.5.1). We also assume Nk(v) has enough quasi-pivotal points (for\ninstance this holds if (G, X) is of compact type). Then (G1 , X1 , H1 , v1 ) has an integral\ncanonical model which is quasi-strongly smooth.\nProof: As we are dealing with a p = 2 standard PEL situation (f, L(2) , v, B)), the\ncentralizer of Gder\nZ(2) in GL(L(2) ) is a reductive group and so, as in Fact 2 of 2.3.5.5, we\ndeduce the existence of a standard cover defined by (f, L(2)). So the Corollary follows\nfrom 4.14.3.2.1.\n4.14.4.1.2. Remarks. 1) The extra condition of 4.14.3.2.1 and 4.14.4.1 b) referring\nto centralizers, can be eliminated, cf. 2.3.5.6.1 A. However, in connection to the p = 2\ntheory of Shimura varieties to be fully developed in \u00a76 and [Va5], this is irrelevant (as\nthe p = 2 SHS's to be \"constructed\" will follow the pattern of [Va2, 6.5-6]).\n2) We take p \u2265 2. We consider a Shimura quadruple (G0 , X0 , H0 , v0 ) of adjoint,\nabelian type, with v0 dividing p, such that any simple factor (G1 , X1 ) of (G0 , X0 ) is of\nCn or DnH type and satisfies the following property:\nThe essentially non-compact property. Every simple factor SF of G1Qp is such\nthat the Shimura group pair (G0Zp , [\u03bc0 ]) defined by (G0 , X0 , H0 , v0 ) is such that \u03bc0B(F)\nhas either a trivial image in SFB(F) or has a non-trivial image in all simple factors of\nSFB(F) .\nThen Lemma 2 of 4.6.4 can be entirely adapted to it: we just have to replace (p = 2)\nstandard PEL situations by (p = 2) SHS's. The only two modifications in its proof needed\nto be made are as follows. First, CV0 is a product of GL(V02n ) copies whose number may\nexceed (in general) the number of simple factors of Gad\nR . Second, we can work everything\nin the context of G1Zp instead of GZp , where G1Zp is the subgroup of GZp generated by the\nmaximal torus of GSp(L(p) \u2297Z(p) Zp , \u03c8) whose extension to V0 is contained in the center\nof CV0 and by each factor of Gder\nZp having a Zp -simple adjoint whose generic fibre is an\nSF as above. So the alternating representation of G1Zp on L(p) \u2297Z(p) Zp gets decomposed\n564\n\n\finto alternating subrepresentations, each one of them being a Zp -version of the (p = 2)\nstandard PEL situations; Warning: some of them are related to Zp -groups which are\ntori (i.e. are not necessarily of Cn or Dn Lie type). So [Va2, 5.6.3] (cf. also AE.1) for\np \u2265 3 and 2.3.18 B for p = 2 can be applied entirely (using the language of abelian\nschemes endowed with Zp -endomorphisms and not with Z(p) -endomorphisms) to get that\n(f, L(p) , v) is a (p = 2) SHS.\nMoreover, we have a version of 4.14.4.1.1 in the context of abelian quadruples having\n(G0 , X0 , H0 , v0 ) as their adjoints.\n3) [Va2, 6.4.11 D] still holds for the compact type cases of 2) or of 4.14.4.1.1, cf. the\npart of 2.2.5.1 referring to [Va2, 3.2.12] and the fact that the arguments of [Va2, 6.4.1.1\n2)] hold as well for p = 2.\n4.14.4.2. Serre lemma via the p-adic approach. We now show that 4.14.4.1 b)\nand AE.4.2 imply the classical Serre lemma of [Mu, p. 207]. Let (A, pA ) be a polarized\nabelian variety over an algebraically closed field k\u0303 of arbitrary characteristic. Let N \u2208\nN \\ {1, 2}. Let a be an automorphism of (A, pA ) acting trivially on A[N ]. We need to\nshow that a is the trivial automorphism.\nWe can assume pA is a principal polarization (cf. Zarhin's trick; see [M-B, p. 205]).\nIf k\u0303 is of characteristic 0, then we can assume it is C and so the fact that a is trivial\ncan be easily checked starting from the classical theorem of Riemann. But, with the\nnotations of [Va2, 4.1], this can be restated as: the subgroup K(N ) of 2.3.3 is smooth\nfor (GSp(W, \u03c8), S) (for instance, this can be read out from Artin's method; see [FC, p.\n23-4]: these two pages have an analogue which considers level-N symplectic similitude\nstructures). Moreover, as the image of K(N ) in P Sp(W, \u03c8)(Ql ) is an open subgroup\nhaving no torsion, it is p-smooth for (GSp(W, \u03c8), S) as well; here l is either an odd prime\ndividing N or is 2, depending on the fact that 4 does not or does divide N . So assuming\nthat the characteristic of k\u0303 is a prime p not dividing N , from AE.4.2 (resp. from 4.14.4.2\nb)) for p \u2265 3 (resp. for p = 2) applied to Siegel modular varieties, we get M/K p (N )\nis smooth over Z(p) and M is a pro-\u00e9tale cover of it; here M is as in [Va2, 3.2.9] and\nK p (N ) is as in 2.3.3. But this implies (for instance, via [FC, p. 23-4]) that a is the trivial\nautomorphism.\nWe are left with the cases: N = p is odd or N = 4 and p = 2. These cases are\n1\ntrivial: as a has finite order, the automorphism of Hcrys\n(A/W (k\u0303)) defined by a is trivial\nm\nand so a acts trivially on A(N ), \u2200m \u2208 N (cf. also 2.3.18.1 D for N = 4). So a is trivial.\nThere is one extra thing worth pointing out. The mentioned Artin's method can\nbe used to get that, provided p does not divide N , there is l \u2208 N such that M/K(N l )\nis smooth over Z(p) and M is a pro-\u00e9tale cover of it: there is q(a, A) \u2208 N such that a\ndoes not act trivially on A[N qA ]; the fact that the stack of principally polarized abelian\nschemes of dimension equal to dimk\u0303 (A) is of finite type over Spec(Z) (see [FC, p. 23-4])\nimplies that we can choose q(a, A) to be independent of a and A. Using this we get the\nexistence of integral canonical models of Siegel modular varieties, without appealing to\nSerre lemma. This also shows that any automorphism of a polarized abelian variety over\na field has finite order.\n565\n\n\f4.14.4.3. Comment. In the classical situation of Siegel modular varieties, most\ncommon one works with some level-N structure (not necessarily a symplectic or symplectic similitude one), see [FC], [MFK], etc., or a very slight variant of it (see the classical\ncase of elliptic modular curves). However this has considerable limitations and disadvantages in the general context of Shimura varieties of preabelian type. This forced us to\nintroduce in [Va2, 2.11] the abstract notion of smooth subgroup for a given Shimura pair;\nDefinition 1 of AE.4 is just a logical continuation of loc. cit. Some of the advantages\nwe gain working in this abstract, general context can be read out from the easiness of\nstating different results: see [Va2, 6.4.4 and 6.4.6 1) and 2)], AE.4.1-2, 4.14.4.1, etc.\n4.14.5. Some extensions. Let k be a perfect field. The greatest part of the\nterminology used in all previous sections can be extended to (filtered) \u03c3k -S-crystals. In\nparticular we get \u03c3k -S-crystals which are U -ordinary, T -ordinary, G-ordinary, potentially\n(or quasi or strongly) cyclic diagonalizable (of level n), etc. Similarly, in a geometric context we get U -ordinary, T -ordinary, G-ordinary, null points, etc; see [Va9] for an extensive\nstudy. Also, notions like deviations (see 3.13 and 4.5.15.0), a-Lie \u03c3k -crystals attached\nto \u03c3k -S-crystals and [a, b]-filtered Lie \u03c3k -crystals attached to filtered \u03c3k -S-crystals (see\n2.2.3 2)), CM levels, NP variation functions, etc., do extend as well. These extensions\nfrom the context of MF[0,1](W (k)) to the contexts of other categories MF[a,b] (W (k))\nare automatic.\n4.14.6. The complete list of invariants. Let (f, L(v), v) be a (p = 2) SHS. In\n2.3 and 4.1-5 (cf. also 4.14.3 for p = 2) we introduced many invariants attached to it.\nHere, for the sake of future references, we list them all. These invariants are: rational\nnumbers, n-tuples of non-negative integers, sets, stratifications, F -crystals over perfect\nfields, groups, etc. Grouping them in some logical way, they are:\na) E(G, X) and e (see 2.3.1);\nb) F (Gad ) and qGad (see 2.3.5.2);\nc) d(f ), d0 (f ), d1 (f ),..., d6 (f ), d(fp ), d0 (fp ), d3 (fp ) and d4 (fp ) (see 2.3.6.1);\nd) L and G (see 2.3.11);\ne) \u03bc, T\u03bc , C(f,v) , \u03c4 , r(f, v), F L(f, v), IL(f, v), SKL(f, v), CL(f, v), SDL(f, v),\nLieG (\u03c4 ), r(v ad ) and SS(v ad ) (see 4.1, 4.1.1 and 4.1.1.2);\nf) d = d(v) (see 4.1.1.1);\ng) L, \u03c6\u0304, I\u03c6\u0304 , dl 's and m(f,v) (\u03c4q )'s (see 4.1.1.4 and 4.1.2.2; here l \u2208 I\u03c6\u0304 , q \u2208 N divides\nd and \u03c4q \u2208 Tq );\nh) WG , RG (v), \u03bc\u03c9 , T\u03bc\u03c9 , C\u03c9 , P\u03c9 , LieG (P\u03c9 ) and \u03c4\u03c9 's (see 4.1.5 and 4.1.5.4-5; here\n\u03c9 \u2208 WG );\nsp\n), d\u03c9 's, SDD(f, v) and MM (see 4.1.5.2-3 and 4.1.6; here \u03c9 \u2208 WG );\ni) k(vG\nj) H, Hnc , Hc , Hi 's, di 's, \u03b3p (Gad ) and Ip (Gad ) (see 4.3.1 and 4.3.1.1; here i \u2208 H);\nk) dA (i)'s, \u03b5i (v ad )'s, \u03b5ci (v ad )'s, dA (v) and dT (v) (see 4.3.1.1-2); here i \u2208 Hnc );\nl) R(\u03c4 ), Rr (\u03c4 ), ai (v ad ), a(v ad ), ar (v ad ), Di+ (v ad )'s and Di\u2212 (v ad )'s (see 4.3.1.2; here\ni \u2208 Hnc );\n566\n\n\fm) SLSp \u2212 rk(Nk(v)) (see 4.3.3);\nn) N P (Nk(v) ), LN P (Nk(v) ), RLN P (Nk(v) ), N (Gad , X ad , v ad ) and N1 (Gad , X ad , v ad )\n(see 4.5.7);\no) the standard stratifications of 4.5 and 4.9.9.1: the canonical Lie, the refined canonical Lie, the \u03c1-stratification, the absolute, the f -canonical, the Lie stable, the refined Lie\nstable, the Lie non-stable, the pseudo-ultra, the quasi-ultra (i.e. the Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013\nHasse\u2013Witt), the ultra, the Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Dieudonn\u00e9 (adjoint, principal or standard),\nthe ultimate and the ultimate adjoint stratifications of Nk(v) and the level-n Faltings\u2013\nShimura\u2013Dieudonn\u00e9 equivalence relation of Nk(v) (F) (here n \u2208 N);\np) fG (see 4.5.11 a));\nq) d(i)'s and di (\u03c9)'s (see 4.5.15.2.3; here i \u2208 H);\nr) GSC(Nk ) (see 4.9.9.2; here k is either k(v) or an algebraically closed field containing k(v));\ns) auti (\u03c9)'s (see 4.5.15.3; here i \u2208 H and \u03c9 \u2208 WG );\nt) N SU (Nk(v) ) and WG (i) (see 4.12.12.6.6 3); here i \u2208 Hnc );\nu) cp (H\u03030 ), cp (H\u03030 , v) and piv(G,X,v) (H\u03030 ) (see 2.3.3 and 4.12.12.6.7; here H\u03030 is as in\n2.3.3);\nv) Dq (G, X, H, v, H\u03030) (see 4.12.12.8).\n4.14.6.1. Class invariants. Let F(dimC (X)) be the algebraically closed field\nof transcendental degree dimC (X) over F. So any point of Nk(v) with values in an\nalgebraically closed field, factors through a point of Nk(v) with values in a subfield of\nF(dimC (X)). Another reason to introduce F(dimC (X)) is: we do not stop to check that\nall class invariants to be defined below are preserved by extensions (to algebraically closed\nfields).

We assume G is not a torus; so CL(f,v) has at least 2 elements\n(cf. 4.3.6 and its proof).\nThe maximal CM level of CL(f,v) is denoted by CM L(CL(f,v)) (see 3.13.7).

In [Va2, 4.3.11], as we worked with the natural trace form on the Lie algebra\ngsp of a group of symplectic similitudes, the condition p does not divide half of the rank\nrL of L needs to be added in order to have it perfect (i.e. in order to have the fourth\nparagraph of [Va2, p. 469] applying). If p is odd and divides rL , then, provided we work\nwith Sp's groups instead of GSp's groups, it still applies entirely, cf. [Va2, 3.1.6]. So, its\nonly application (for p \u2265 3), i.e. [Va2, 5.6.3], does not need to be modified. The Claim of\n[Va2, 4.3.11] is still true, under a very slight (compulsory) restriction, even if p = 2 and\n4|rL , see a) and c) of 2.3.18 B3.\nAE.2. The argument of the first sentence of [Va2, 6.4.6 5)] ought to be enlarged.\nAs in [Va2, 3.2.7 11)], we consider two injective maps (G1 , X1 , H1 ) \u0592\u2192 (G, X, H) and\nad\nad\nad\n(G2 , X2 , H2 ) \u0592\u2192 (G, X, H), such that all simple factors of (Gad\n1 , X1 ) and (G2 , X2 )\nare of preabelian and respectively of special type and we have a natural identification\nad\nGad = Gad\n1 \u00d7G2 . [Va2, 6.4.1] (resp. [Va2, 3.4.1]) points out that (G1 , X1 , H1 ) (resp. that\n(G2 , X2 , H2 )) has an integral canonical model N1 (resp. has a quasi-projective normal\nintegral model N2 having the EP). As in [Va2, 3.2.16] we get that (G1 \u00d7G2 , X1 \u00d7X2 , H1 \u00d7\nH2 ) has a quasi-projective normal integral model N12 having the EP. Using the fact that\nder\nthe intersection Gder\n(taken inside Gder ) is a finite group scheme of order relatively\n1 \u2229 G2\nprime to p, from [Va2, 6.2.3] and [Va2, A) to E) of 6.2.2 b)] we get that (G, X, H) has a\nnormal integral model N over the normalization of Z(p) in E(G2 \u00d7 G1 , X2 \u00d7 X1 ), which\nis a quotient of N12 through a free (see [Va2, 3.4.5.1]) action. From [Va2, 3.2.12] we get:\nif (G, X, H) has an integral canonical model, then N is smooth; so also N12 and N2 are\nsmooth. So we can replace (G, X, H) by (G1 \u00d7 G2 , X1 \u00d7 X2 , H1 \u00d7 H2 ). So [Va2, 6.4.6 5)]\nfollows from [Va2, 6.2.2-3 and 6.4.1] or from [Va2, 6.2.4 and 6.4.1].\nAE.3. The condition of [Va2, 4.3.6 3)] on the existence of Lie is not enough; the\nreason is: it misses data needed to relate H1\u2032 R/I1 +I2 with H2\u2032 R/I1 +I2 . Loc. cit. was\nthought as taking aside part of the argument of [Va2, 4.3.7 4)]; so in loc. cit. we had in\nmind the context of [Va2, 4.3.7 4)] (see the Proposition below). It turns out that [Va2,\n4.3.7 4) and 5)] as well needs some mild assumptions (they can be read out from the\nProposition below and so they will not be restated explicitly).\nThe impact of this is (cf. what follows below): the sentence (between parantheses)\ncontaining \"it is instructive not to do so\" (used before [Va2, Case a) of the proof of\n4.3.10]) should be deleted (however, i) below and combinations of i) and iii) below allow\nits usage under some restrictions). Warning: this deletion does not necessarily need to\nbe performed in the context of the similar sentence (used before [Va2, Part 1) of the\nproof of 4.3.10]) or in connection to [Va2, 4.3.10.2], cf. iii) below. However, the proof\nof Proposition below is very much the same as parts of the proof of [Va2, 4.3.10 b)] and\nso (cf. also AE3.1 3) below) one might still prefer to perform such a deletion. So what\nfollows is just of group theoretical interest; the reader interested just in applications to\nShimura varieties can skip to AE.4.\nComing back to [Va2, 4.3.6 3)], its conclusion holds if the O-algebras R/(Ij \u2229i\u2208SI Ii ),\nfor any j \u2208 I and for every non-empty subset SI of I \\ {j}, are still faithfully flat, or if\nO is of equal characteristic 0. In both situations we get that H1\u2032 R/I1 +I2 and H2\u2032 R/I1 +I2\n571\n\n\fcoincide (for the second one cf. also the part below referring to ii)). Let p be an arbitrary\nrational prime. We start with a definition.\nDefinition. A faithful representation \u03c1T : T \u0592\u2192 GL(V ) of a split torus over an\narbitrary field k\u0303 is called p Lie recoverable, if T is generated by a finite family (Tj )j\u2208J\nof subtori of it such that for any j \u2208 J, the representation of Tj on V does not involve\ntwo distinct characters of Tj whose difference inside the group of characters of Tj (viewed\nadditively) is divisible by p. If J has just 1 element, then we also say \u03c1T is elementary p\nLie recoverable.\nWe situate ourselves in the context of the first paragraph of [Va2, 4.3.6 3)]. We\nassume that there is a noetherian, local, integral O-subalgebra R0 of R such that R is\nthe strict henselization of R0 , that M is obtained by extension of scalars from a free\nR0 -module M0 and that H \u2032 is obtained by pull back from a reductive subgroup H0\u2032 of\nGL(M0 )R0 [ \u03c01 ] . We also assume the existence of a projector \u03a0 of End(M ) on Lie fixed by\nH \u2032 . So we have a direct sum decomposition End(M ) = Lie \u2295 Ker(\u03a0) preserved by the\naction of H \u2032 on End(M [ \u03c01 ]). Let l (resp. lR ) be the residue field of O (resp. of R). Let\nk\u0303 be the algebraic closure of the field of fractions k\u03030 of R0 .\nIf H0\u2032 is non-trivial and semisimple, then s(H \u2032 0k\u0303 , M0 \u2297R0 k\u0303) \u2208 N is defined by: it\nis the maximal dimension of indecomposable ST -submodules of M0 \u2297R0 k\u0303, with ST running through all standard semisimple subgroups of H0\u2032 k\u0303 whose adjoints are P SL2 's\ngroups. Here \"standard\" is used in the same manner as in [Va2, 4.3.3] but at the level\nof subgroups and not of Lie subalgebras of Lie(H \u2032 0k\u0303 ). If O is of characteristic 0, then\ns(H \u2032 0k\u0303 , M0 \u2297R0 k\u0303) = s(Lie(H \u2032 0k\u0303 ), M0 \u2297R0 k\u0303) (cf. Weyl's complete reductibility theorem\nand the standard connections between subrepresentations of Lie(H \u2032 0k\u0303 ) and of H0\u2032 k\u0303 ). In\n[Va2, 4.3.10.2], by s(g0 , W ) in case g0 is over a field of positive characteristic, we meant\ns(G0 , W ).\nProposition. The Zariski closure of H0\u2032 in GL(M0 ) is a reductive group if moreover\nany one of the following three conditions hold:\ni) l is of characteristic p, H \u2032 is a torus and the representation \u03c1k\u0303 of H \u2032 0k\u0303 on M0 \u2297R0 k\u0303\nis p Lie recoverable;\nii) l is of characteristic 0;\niii) H0\u2032 is non-trivial and semisimple, the characteristic of l is an odd prime p \u2265\ns(H 0k\u0303 , M0 \u2297R0 k\u0303) and moreover the semisimplification AU T ss of the connected component\nAU T 0 of the origin of Aut(Lie \u2297R lR )red is smooth of dimension equal to the relative\ndimension of H0\u2032 .\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\nProof: It is enough to show HR\nis a reductive subgroup of GL(M ). As in [Va2,\n4.3.6 3)] we can concentrate most of the time just on 1, 2 \u2208 I.\n\nThe first step is to check that the pull backs of H1\u2032 R/I1 +I2 and H2\u2032 R/I1 +I2 to\nSpec(R/I1 + I2 )red coincide. For ii) this is a consequence of [Bo2, 7.1]. For i) this can\nbe checked as follows. The generic fibre GF of H0\u2032 splits over a Galois field extension of\n572\n\n\fk\u03030 contained in the residue field of any point of Spec(R/Ii ) of codimension 0, \u2200i \u2208 I. So\nwe can assume GF is a split torus. So, based on arguments similar to the ones of [Va2,\n3.1.6] pertaining to TR2 of loc. cit., we can assume \u03c1k\u0303 is elementary p Lie recoverable; but\nthis case follows from the very definitions. In other words: we can recover the maximal\ndirect sum decomposition of M \u2297R R/Ii normalized by Hi\u2032 from the representation of\nLie \u2297R R/Ii on M \u2297R Ri ; moreover, the character of the representation of Hi\u2032 on any\nfixed member of it can be read out from the representation of GF on M0 \u2297R0 k\u03030 (i = 1, 2).\nFor the time being we assume that the pull backs of H1\u2032 R/I1 +I2 and H2\u2032 R/I1 +I2 to\n\u2032\nSpec(R/I1 + I2 )red coincide even for iii); so let H12\nred be the reductive subgroup of\nGL(M \u2297R (R/I1 + I2 )red ) with which these two pull backs coincide. Let R12 := R/I1 +I2\nand let N be its ideal of nilpotent elements. Let n \u2208 N be such that N n = {0}. We\nconsider a maximal tori Ti of Hi\u2032 R12 , i = 1, 2. We can assume that T1 and T2 lift the\n\u2032\nsame maximal torus T12 of H12\nred , cf. [SGA3, Vol. II, 3.6 of p. 48]. Loc. cit. implies as\nwell the existence of g \u2208 GL(M \u2297R R12 ) which mod N is the identity and gT1 g \u22121 = T2\nas tori of GL(M \u2297R R12 ).\nThe second step is to show, by induction on j \u2208 {1, ..., n}, that we can assume Lie(T1 )\nand Lie(T2 ), as R12 -submodules of End(M \u2297R R12 ), coincide modulo N j . The passage\nfrom j to j + 1 goes as follows. We can assume g mod N j is the identity. The existence\nof g implies the existence of A \u2208 N j End(M \u2297R R12 ) such that under the automorphism\n1End(M \u2297R R12 ) +ad(A) of End(M \u2297R R12 ), Lie(T1 ) mod N j+1 is mapped onto Lie(T2 ) mod\nN j+1 . But due to the existence of \u03a0, modulo N j+1 we can assume A \u2208 N j Lie\u2297R R12 . As\nthe Lie algebra of H1\u2032 is Lie \u2297R R/I1 , we can assume g mod N j+1 is an R12 /N j+1 -valued\npoint of H1\u2032 . So, by replacing T1 by an H1\u2032 (R12 )-conjugate of it, we can assume that the\nrestrictions mod N j+1 of Lie(T1 ) and Lie(T2 ) are the same. So, by induction, we can\nassume Lie(T1 ) = Lie(T2 ).\nThe third step is to check that Lie(T1 ) = Lie(T2 ) implies T1 = T2 . For i) this is a\nconsequence of Definition: as above, we can recover the maximal direct sum decomposition of M \u2297R R12 normalized by T1 as well as the characters through which T1 acts on\nits members from Lie(T1 ) (and GF). The same applies for ii).\nFor iii) we have to proceed as in [Va2, p. 465]:\n\u2013 if p > 2s(H \u2032 0k\u0303 , M0 \u2297R0 k\u0303), then we can apply the part of the previous paragraph\nreferring to i) (argument: we need to consider as in loc. cit. the standard 1 dimensional\nsplit subtori of T1 in order to get that we are in the context of elementary p Lie recoverable\nrepresentations of their fibres over k\u0303; so the representation of T1k\u0303 on M0 \u2297R0 k\u0303 is p Lie\nrecoverable);\n\u2013 if s(H \u2032 0k\u0303 , M0 \u2297R0 k\u0303) \u2264 p \u2264 2s(H \u2032 0k\u0303 , M0 \u2297R0 k\u0303), then we have to use as in loc. cit.\nstandard sl2 Lie subalgebras of Lie \u2297R R12 in order to be able to recover the maximal\ndirect sum decomposition of M \u2297R R12 normalized by T1 , from the representations of\nLie(T1 ) and of Lie \u2297R R12 on it.\nWhat follows next for ii) and iii) is very much the same as [Va2, p. 464 and p. 466]:\nusing exponential maps (for iii) this is allowed as p \u2265 s(H \u2032 0k\u0303 , M0 \u2297R0 k\u0303)), we can recover\n573\n\n\ffrom T1 and Lie \u2297R R12 the Ga subgroups of Hi\u2032 R12 normalized by T1 and so, based on\n[SGA3, Vol. III, 4.1.2 of p. 172] we get that an open subscheme of H1\u2032 R12 coincides with\n\u2032\nan open subscheme of H2\u2032 R12 and so H1\u2032 R12 = H2\u2032 R12 . The rest of the argument that HR\nis a reductive group is based on amalgamated sums and is as in [Va2, 4.3.6 3)]. This\nparagraph forms the fourth step.\nSo to end the proof, we need to argue the first step for iii). The natural homomorphism from Hi\u2032 lR to AU T ss is an isogeny (it is nothing else but the natural central\nisogeny Hi\u2032 lR \u2192 Hi\u2032ad lR ; as p is odd this can be checked easily using standard sl2 Lie\nsubalgebras of Lie \u2297R lR ). We get: Lie(T1 ) \u2297R/I1 lR is the Lie algebra of a maximal torus\nof H2\u2032 lR and so we can assume it is the Lie algebra of Lie(T2 ) \u2297R lR . As in the above\npart referring to the subcases corresponding to the fact that p is or is not greater than\n2s(H \u2032 0k\u0303 , M0 \u2297R0 k\u0303), we get T1 lR = T2 lR . As in the previous paragraph, we get: H1\u2032 lR and\nH2\u2032 lR coincide. But the role of lR is just to fix notations: the same applies to any point\nSpec( \u0303lR ) \u2192 Spec(R12 ), with  \u0303lR an algebraically closed field, lifting a point of the special\nfibre of Spec(O); we just need to mention that Lie \u2297R  \u0303lR = Lie \u2297R lR \u2297lR  \u0303lR (cf. the\nuniqueness theorem of [SGA3, Vol. III, p. 313-4] and the fact that H0\u2032 is over R0 [ \u03c01 ]).\nAE.3.1. Remarks. 1) In practice we use i) and iii) intermingled. The last part\nof the above paragraph points out that the conditions of iii) are such that they can be\nchecked over O, using an arbitrary split semisimple group over O whose extension to R/I1\nis isomorphic to H1\u2032 (it does not matter which element 1 \u2208 I we use); so all three parts\nof the Proposition can be used to get right versions of [Va2, 4.3.7 4) and 5)]. Moreover,\nit is easy to see (based on [Bo2, 7.1] and on arguments involving non-degenerate trace\nforms) that the two assumptions of the second paragraph before the Proposition, are not\nneeded in connection to ii).\n2) In [Va2, 4.3.6 3)] we could add: the fact that H \u2032 is split can be obtained via\n[SGA3, Vol. III, 1.5 of p. 329] applied over R/I1 + I2 (using the fact that we are in a\nlocal, strictly henselian context) and then making \u03c0 invertible; so the sentence of [Va2,\n\u2032\n4.3.6 3)] referring to it should have been placed after the argument that H12\nexists (i.e.\n\u2032\n\u2032\nafter showing that we have H1 R12 = H2 R12 ).\n3) The part of iii) referring to AU T 0 automatically holds if the Killing form on\nLie(H1 ) is perfect: in such a case AU T 0 is semisimple (cf. [Va2, Part 1 of p. 463-4]).\nAE.4. Let p be a rational prime. A great part of the proof of [Va2, Lemma of p.\n496] is wrong and in fact there are contraexamples to it (for instance, with HO of Ap\u22121\nLie type). There are two mistakes in its proof. First, in the case p = 2 and G = \u03bc2 ,\nwe need to assume that the special fibre of G is a subscheme of PO/pO ; as mentioned in\nloc. cit. this case is trivial: we can assume O is complete and so [SGA3, Vol. II, 3.6 of\np. 48] implies G is contained in gPO g \u22121 , with g \u2208 HO (O) congruent to the identity mod\n2. Second, the last part of it referring to an action of \u03bcp on Spec(O)O2 makes no sense.\nWe did not have time to rethink the whole issue (i.e. to list all cases when it holds), so\nhere we just mention that [Va2, 3.4.5.4 3)] implies that [Va2, Lemma of p. 496] holds at\nleast if p \u2212 1 is greater than the relative dimension of each factor of HO /PO defined by\na simple factor of HO (here we can assume O is strictly henselian).\n574\n\n\fHowever, [Va2, 6.2.2.1] still holds in different forms (some weaker and some slightly\nstronger). We take a longer root, in order to fully exploit what can be done about it.\nWe start with an arbitrary Shimura pair (G, X). The \"root of the problem\" is in [Va2,\n2.11]. In loc. cit. we defined subgroups of G(Af ) smooth for (G, X): such a subgroup\nH is said to be smooth for (G, X) if it is compact and Sh(G, X) is a pro-\u00e9tale cover of\nShH (G, X). Warning: in order to avoid always taking quotients (see [De2, 2.1.12]), we\nallow H to have elements which act trivially on Sh(G, X). For instance any compact,\nneat subgroup of G(Af ) is smooth for (G, X). However, smooth subgroups are far more\ngeneral than compact, neat subgroups. Here we mention just two examples.\nExample 1. If G is a torus, then any compact subgroup of G(Af ) is smooth for\n(G, X) (cf. [Va2, 3.2.8]).\nExample 2. We assume G is a Q\u2013simple, adjoint group. We assume GQp has\ntwo non-trivial factors G1 and G2 and there is a non-trivial, finite subgroup H of\nG1 (Qp ). Then H is smooth for (G, X). This is a consequence of the structure of the set\nSh(G, X)(C) (see [De2, 2.1.1]): as G(Q) has trivial intersection with any G(Af )-conjugate\nof H, any g \u2208 H acts freely on this set and so on Sh(G, X). We get: there are compact,\nopen subgroup of G(Af ) which contain H, are smooth for (G, X) but are not neat.\nWe propose some extra classes of compact subgroups of G(Apf ) which are \"between\"\nthe neat ones and the ones smooth for (G, X). Let H be a compact subgroup of G(Af ).\nDefinition 1. a) H is called S-smooth for (G, X) (here S stands for strongly) if it\nis smooth and for each connected component C of ShH (G, X)C there is a compact, open\nsubgroup H1 of G(Apf ) containing the subgroup H(C) of H leaving invariant C and such\nthat the set of complex points of the connected component of ShH1 (G, X)C dominated\nnaturally by C can be identified (see [De2, p. 266-7]) with \u03a3 \\ X 0 , with X 0 a connected\ncomponent of X and with \u03a3 an arithmetic subgroup of Gad (Q) which does not have\n2-torsion.\nb) We say H is p-smooth if it is smooth and for each connected component C of\nShH (G, X)C there is a rational prime l(C) different from p such that the image of any\npro-p subgroup Hp (C) of H(C) (with H(C) as in a)) in Gad (Ql(C) ) is trivial. If S is a set\nof rational primes having at least two elements, we say H is S-smooth, if it p-smooth for\nany p \u2208 S.\nLet v be a prime of E(G, X) dividing p. Let O be a faithfully flat, DVR O(v) -algebra.\nWe consider a smooth (resp. normal) integral model N of ShH (G, X) over O. b) suggests\nthe following variant of [Va2, def. 3.4.8].\nDefinition 2. a) N is said to be quasi-strongly smooth (resp. quasi-strongly\nnormal) if for any compact, open subgroup H0 of G(Apf ) such the subgroup H0 \u00d7 H\nof G(Af ) is p-smooth for (G, X), N is a pro-\u00e9tale cover of N /H0 .\nb) If p = 2 we say N is A-strongly smooth (resp. A-strongly normal), if N is a\npro-\u00e9tale cover of N /H0 , for any subgroup H0 of G(Apf ) such the subgroup H0 \u00d7 H of\nG(Af ) is S-smooth for (G, X) (here A stands for almost).\n575\n\n\fReferring to [Va2, Lemma of p. 496], there is n \u2208 N easy computable in terms of\nHO , such that HO (O) has no elements of order pn . This is an immediate consequence of\nthe following two facts, applied in the context of any faithful representation of HO (for\ninstance, the adjoint one):\n\u2013 HF (F) has no semisimple elements of order p and all its unipotent elements have\nan order dividing a fixed power of p;\n\u2013 [Va2, 3.4.5.2] and its variant for p = 2 (if p = 2, any O-endomorphism of a free Omodule of finite rank of order a power of 2 and which mod 4 is congruent to the identity,\nis the trivial endomorphism).\nWe now start correcting the parts of [Va2] relying on [Va2, Lemma of p. 496]. In\nwhat follows, (G, X, H, v), (G1 , X1 , H1 , v), (G2 , X2 , H2 ), X 0 , M1 , M2 , p > 2, Lp , (W, \u03c8),\nV0 and C 0 = C2 are as in [Va2, 6.2.2 b) and its proof]. To conform with the notations of\nthis paper, we denote Lp by L(p) . Let G2Z(p) be the reductive group over Z(p) obtained\nby taking the Zariski closure of G2 in GL(L(p) ). We take O := V0 and HO := Gad\n2V0 . We\nconsider g \u2208 Aut(G2 , X2 , H2 ); we do not assume it is inner (i.e. is defined by an element\np\np\nof Gad\n2Z(p) (Z(p) )). Moreover, H2 is a compact, open subgroup of G2 (Af ) normalized by g\nand such that the morphism M2 \u2192 M2 /H2p is a pro-\u00e9tale cover. On [Va2, p. 494-7],\n\"M2 /H2p \u00d7 H2 \"\n\"M2 /H2p \" and \"M2V0 /H2p \u00d7 H2 \"\n\"M2V0 /H2p \". The Z-lattice L of\n[Va2, p. 494] is as in [Va2, 5.1.2].\nWe assume g is such that the automorphism ag of N2V0 /H2p it defines naturally leaves\ninvariant the image C(H2p ) in N2V0 /H2p of the (chosen) connected component C2 of N2V0 .\nWarning: this does not necessarily imply that g leaves invariant X 0 . We also assume ag\nacts freely on the generic fibre of C(H2p ). We have four different possibilities (which can\nbe combined) in connection to [Va2, 6.2.2.1]:\na1) we require X2 = X2ad and that in fact ag acts freely on the generic fibre of N2V0 /H2p ;\na2) we require the order o(ag ) of ag to be divisible by pn+n1 , where pn1 is the greatest\npower of p dividing the order of the image of g into the group of outer automorphisms\nof the product of all simple, non-compact factors of Gad\nR ;\na3) we require that g over R normalizes X 0 and each simple factor of Gad\nR ;\na4) g is defined by an element of Gad\n2Z(p) (Z(p) ) which is contained in a compact subgroup\np\np\np\nad\nH2pad (g) of Gad\n2 (Af ) containing the image of H2 in G2 (Af ) and having the property\nad\nthat H2pad (g) \u00d7 H2ad is p-smooth for (Gad\n2 , X2 ).\n\nIf we work under a3), then there is m \u2208 N relatively prime to p such that g m is an\ninner automorphism of Gad\n2 . This is a consequence of the structure of the group of outer\nautomorphisms of an absolutely simple group of classical Lie type and (in case p = 3 and\nGad has simple factors of D4 Lie type) of the fact that g leaves invariant X 0 .\nIf g is inner and we work under a1), then either g is not an element of finite order\nor ag does not fix any F-valued point of C(H2p ). Argument: if it is of finite order, then\nwe can assume (cf. [Va2, 3.4.5.1]) that this order is a power of p and so g over R (as\n576\n\n\fp \u2265 3 there is no invertible element of R of order p) is contained in a maximal compact\nad\nsubgroup of Gad\n2 (R); so it fixes an element of X2 = X2 (cf. also [De2, 1.2.8]) and so ag\np\ndoes not act freely on the generic fibre of N2V0 /H2 . Contradiction.\nProposition. If we work under a2), then ag acts freely on C(H2p ). In particular,\nthis applies if g is inner and Gad\nV0 (V0 ) has no element of order p.\nProof: If ag fixes an F-valued point y of C(H2p ), then we can define g0 as in [Va2,\np. 495]; its order is the same as the order of g. As in loc. cit. we can assume o(ag ) is a\nn1\nn1\npower of p and that g0p is inner. As pn divides o(g0p ) we reach a contradiction to the\ndefinition of n.\nRemarks. For another form of this Proposition, see 4.4.13.5; see \u00a713 for extra\nimprovements of the Proposition (similar to the one of 4.4.13.5) obtained based on the\nextra fact that in [Va2, p. 495], g0 was defining an automorphism of a Shimura adjoint\n\u03c3-crystal over F (see def. 2.2.11 4) and end of 2.2.22 2)). This Proposition does not suffice\nin applications to [Va2, 6.2.2 b)]; so to considerable strengthen it, we need to bring into\nthe picture some extra tools.\nAE.4.1. We can assume G1 is adjoint (the action of a subgroup of a group acting\nad\nfreely is free); so (G1 , X1 ) = (Gad\n2 , X2 ). Based on [Va2, 6.2.3 and 6.4.2] we can assume\nG1 is Q\u2013simple. The only cases of [Va2, 6.2.2 b)] not covered by [Va2, 6.2.2 a)] are those\nin which p is odd and Gad\n2 has factors of Apm\u22121 Lie type. So based on [Va2, 6.5.1.1 and\n6.6.5.1], we can assume we are in the context of a standard PEL situation (f2 , L(p) , v2 , B2 )\n(as defined in 2.3.5, cf. also 2.3.5.1), where v2 is a prime of E(G2 , X2 ) dividing the prime\nad\nv ad of E(Gad , X ad ) = E(Gad\n2 , X2 ) divided by v.\nWe consider an injective map (G2 , X2 ) \u0592\u2192 (G\u20322 , X2\u2032 ), with G\u20322 as the subgroup of\nGL(W ) generated by G2 and by the center of the centralizer of G2 in GL(W ). The\nZariski closure of G\u20322 in GL(L(p) ) is a reductive group G\u20322Z(p) and moreover we get a cover\nad\nq2\u2032 : (G\u20322 , X2\u2032 ) \u2192 (Gad\n2 , X2 );\n\nthe first part can be seen immediately inside GL(L(p) \u2297Z(p) V0 ), starting from the classification provided by [Ko2, top of p. 375 and p. 395], while the second part is a consequence\nof the fact that the center Z(G\u20322 ) of G\u20322 is the group scheme defined by invertible elements\nof an \u00e9tale Q\u2013algebra AL of endomorphisms of W . M2 is an open closed subscheme of\nthe integral canonical model M\u20322 of the Shimura quadruple (G\u20322 , X2\u2032 , G\u20322Z(p) (Zp ), v2 ) (cf.\n[Va2, 6.2.3 and 3.2.15]).\nSo, based on [Mi1, 4.13], we can assume that a connected component of M1V0 is the\nquotient of C 0 = C2 (see [Va2, p. 494]) by a group of automorphisms GA of C2 which\nare defined by right translation by elements of a subgroup of the group GR of Apf -valued\npoints of the center Z(G\u20322 ) of G\u20322 ; based on [De2, 2.1.12], in fact we can replace GR by\nthe familiar group (of the class field theory)\nZ(G\u20322 )(Apf )/Z(G\u20322 )(L(p) ),\n577\n\n\fcf. also [Va2, 3.3.1]. We can assume AL \u2282 B2 \u2297Z(p) Q.\nWe consider an element h \u2208 Z(G\u20322 ) defining an element of GA. We assume it fixes a\npoint y \u2208 C2 (F). y gives birth to a quadruple\nQy = (Ay , pAy , B2 , (kN )N\u2208N, (N,p)=1 ),\nwhere (Ay , pAy ) is a principally polarized abelian variety over F of dimension 21 dimQ (W ),\nendowed with a family of Z(p) -endomorphisms (still denoted by B2 ) and having (in a\ncompatible way; see [Va2, top of p. 455]) level-N symplectic similitude structure kN ,\nN \u2208 N with (N, p) = 1, such that some axioms are satisfied, cf. the standard interpretation of N2 as a moduli scheme (to be compared also with [Ko2, ch. 5]). We\nhave a similar modular interpretation for F-valued and V0 -valued points of N2\u2032 , provided we work in a Z(p) -context; in such a context we speak about principally Z(p) polarized abelian varieties, Z(p) -isomorphisms (i.e. isomorphisms up to Z(p) -isogenies\nas defined in 2.1), etc. So the translation of y by h gives birth to a similar quadruple\n\u2032\nQ\u2032y = (A\u2032y , pA\u2032y , B2 , (kN\n)N\u2208N, (N,p)=1 ), with (A\u2032y , pA\u2032y ) a principally Z(p) -polarized abelian\nvariety over F which is Z(p) -isogeneous to (Ay , pAy ). Due to this Z(p) -isogeny, we can\n1\n1\n(A\u2032y /V0 ) with M := Hcrys\n(Ay /V0 ).\nidentify Hcrys\nThe fact that h fixes y means that these quadruples are isomorphic, under a Z(p) isomorphism a : Ay \u2192A\n \u0303 \u2032y . The automorphism aM of M we get (via a and the mentioned\nidentification), as an element of End(M ), belongs to the Q\u2013vector space generated by the\ncrystalline realizations of the Q\u2013endomorphisms of Ay naturally defined by elements of\nLie(Z(G\u20322 )): this can be read out from the \u00e9tale context with Ql -coefficients, where l is an\narbitrary prime different from p. So aM leaves invariant any F 1 -filtration of M defined\nby a V0 -valued point lift z of C2 lifting y. Such a lift is determined by the mentioned\nfiltration, cf. the deformation theory (see [Me, ch. 4-5]) of polarized abelian varieties\nendowed with endomorphisms; see also [Va2, 5.6.4]. So from the modular interpretation\nof N2 we get: h fixes all these lifts. So h acts trivially on C2 . We conclude: C2 is a\npro-\u00e9tale cover of C2 /GA. This completes the corrected proof of [Va2, 6.2.2 b)].\nAE.4.1.1. The use of Z(p) -isogenies in AE.4.1 can be entirely avoided. This goes as\nfollows. Let G3 := Gad\n2 \u00d7 Gm ; identifying Gm with the quotient of G2 by its subgroup\n0\nG2 acting trivially on \u03c8, we get naturally an epimorphism q2 : G2 \u0589 G3 . Let (G3 , X3 )\nbe the Shimura pair such that q2 defines a finite map\nq2 : (G2 , X2 ) \u2192 (G3 , X3 ).\nFact. Let A := Ker(q2 ). For any field l of characteristic 0, the group H 1 (Gal(l), A( \u0304l))\nis a 2-torsion group (which in general \u2013like for l = R\u2013 is non-trivial).\nProof: From the structure of G02 (for instance, see [Ko2, ch. 5 and 7]) we get that\nA is a product of Weil restriction of scalars from some totally real number fields to Q of\n1 dimensional tori which over R are compact (if B \u2297Z(p) Q is a simple Q\u2013algebra, then\nthe mentioned product has only one factor). The Fact follows.\n578\n\n\fSo q2 is not a cover but from the point of view of free actions (see [Va2, 3.4.5.1]) it\nis \"close enough\". In other words, the image of C2C in the quotient of ShH2 (G2 , X2 )C by\nA(Apf ) is a (potentially infinite) Galois cover of the image of C2C in ShH3 (G3 , X3 )C whose\nGalois group is a 2-torsion group, cf. also [Va2, 3.3.1]; here H3 := H2ad \u00d7 Gm (Zp ) and C2C\nis obtained via extension of scalars through an arbitrary O(v2 ) -monomorphism V0 \u0592\u2192 C.\nSo, referring to AE.4.1, eventually by replacing h by h2 , we can assume h \u2208 G2 (Apf ). So\nAE.4.1 can be performed \"in terms\" of q2 and not of q2\u2032 .\nHowever, the context of q2\u2032 is more convenient for generalizations (see the whole of\n2.3.5.5-6) and moreover it can be adapted (see the proof of 4.14.3.2.1) for p = 2.\nAE.4.2. [Va2, 6.2.2.1] was used in [Va2, 6.2.4.1] and so implicitly in [Va2, 6.4.4].\nFor the meaning of mid(X) and of the torsion number t(Gad ) we refer to 2.1. We have:\nExercise. Let (G\u0303, X\u0303) be an adjoint Shimura pair, with all simple factors of G\u0303 of\nclassical Lie type. We assume G\u0303Qp is unramified. Then the inequality mid(X) + 3 \u2264 p\nimplies: p does not divide t(Gad ). If mid(X) + 2 = p, then it can happen that p|t(Gad ).\nHints: for the first part use the classification of [He, p. 518] and the fact that a GLn group over the Witt ring W R of a perfect field of characteristic p, with n + 1 < p, can\nnot have W R-valued points of order p; for the second part, use Q\u2013forms of SU (1, p \u2212 2)ad\nR\nor of SO(2, p \u2212 2)R .\nSo, in connection to the part of the first paragraph of AE.4 referring to [Va2, 3.5.4 3)],\nit is shorter and more convenient to work with t(Gad ) rather than mid(X); accordingly,\nin all that follows we state our results in terms of t(Gad )'s. However, it is useful to keep\nin mind that for Shimura varieties whose adjoint varieties are products of simple, adjoint\nvarieties which are either of B p\u22121 type or of Ap\u22122 type involving Q\u2013simple groups which\n2\nover R have only simple factors of the form SU (a, p \u2212 1 \u2212 a)R , with a \u2208 {0, 1}, one can\ndo a little bit better (with respect to the odd prime p). We have the following correction\nof [Va2, 6.2.4.1 and 6.4.4]:\nCorrection. a) In [Va2, 6.2.4.1] we need to either assume p 6 |t(Gad ) or to replace\nstrongly smooth by quasi-strongly smooth.\nb) In [Va2, 6.4.4] we need to assume HS \u00d7 H S is S1 -smooth for (G, X), where S1\nis the set of odd rational primes belonging to S and dividing t(Gad ).\nb) is a consequence of a), cf. the proof of [Va2, 6.4.4]. The proof of a) is very much\nthe same as AE.4.1 (cf. also Proposition of AE.4); the only difference: fixing a connected\ncomponent C of ShH (G, X)C , we have \"control\" only on one prime l(C) different from\np (cf. a) of Definition 1). As the part of AE.4.1 involving G\u20322 has not been previously\nused (i.e. known outside the context of standard PEL situations), a) is detailed (as an\napplication) in 2.3.5.8. From a) we get:\nCorollary. We refer to AE.4. If we work under a4), then ag acts freely on C(H2p ).\nFor the sake of completeness we repeat here the philosophy of [Va2, 6.4.6 6)] in a\nslightly corrected form as suggested by Correction.\n579\n\n\fPh. To generalize Serre's lemma [Mu1, p. 207] to the context of an integral canonical models N of a Shimura quadruple (G, X, H, v) of preabelian type (with v dividing a\nrational prime p \u2265 5) and of a compact subgroup H0 of G(Apf ), it is enough to check things\nin characteristic zero (i.e. to check that Sh(G, X) is a pro-\u00e9tale cover of ShH0 \u00d7H (G, X))\nas well as, in case p|t(Gad ), that H0 \u00d7 H is in fact p-smooth (and not just smooth) for\n(G, X).\nAE.5. For a detailed (slightly corrected) version of [Va2, 5.5.1] we refer to 2.4.\nAE.6. In Step 6 of [Va2, 3.1.3.1] we could add that Y2\u2032 is obtained from Yb2 as in\nStep 4 of loc. cit. In the proof of [Va2, 3.1.6], we could add first that the kernel of \u03c1 is the\nextension of a finite, flat group scheme by a torus, before concluding that it is a finite,\nflat group scheme (i.e. that this torus is trivial). Also we could add that the fastest way\nto see that G1R is a reductive group, is to remark that we have a short exact sequence\n0 \u2192 G0der\n\u2192 G1R \u2192 TR /CR \u2192 0.\nR\nIn [Va2, 3.2.1.1 15) and 16) and the proof of 3.2.2.1], we do not need to add quasiseparatedness to the quasi-compactness assumptions, despite the fact that in [EGA IV,\n\u00a78] this is always done. It is [FC, 2.7 of p. 9] which implies that in connection to abelian\nschemes over normal schemes, quasi-separatedness condition can be dropped. Similarly,\nas Y1 is normal and geometrically connected over the field KV of characteristic 0, in [Va2,\ntop of p. 431] we can still appeal to the fundamental exact sequence of [SGA1, p. 253],\neven if Y1KV is not quasi-compact.\nIt is worth pointing out that in [Va2, proof of 3.2.2.1], the existence of O1\u2032 in the case\nwhen Y is not quasi-compact, can be seen as well using Weil divisors, starting from the\nembedding of Ad(AU1 ),1,N in the projective scheme \u0100d(AU1 ),1,N as of [FC, \u00a75 of ch. V] and\nusing [FC, iv) of 10.1 of p. 88]. Before the fourth sentence of [Va2, proof of 3.2.2.3] we\ncould add that we can assume Z is local, and using descent that it is strictly henselian;\nso the last paragraph of [Va2, proof of 3.2.2.1] can be imitated in the context of Z as well\n(to bring the things back to the level of O-schemes of finite type).\nWe could add to [Va2, 4.2] that [g, g] is algebraizable (see [Bo2, 7.6]) and so (as we\nare in characteristic 0 and g is reductive) the restriction of Tr to it is non-degenerate.\nWe could add in the beginning of the proof of the Claim 1 of [Va2, 4.3.10 a)], that g(M )\nis free (as \u03c0(g) is enveloped by M ). In [Va2, 4.3.10.2], we could add that any strictly\nhenselian DVR is a Nagata ring (easy consequence of [Ma, Cor. 2 of p. 234]). Related\nto [Va2, p. 463], we could add that g(M ) is naturally isomorphic to its dual and so it is\nirrelevant if we use R[[g(M )]] or R[[g(M )\u2217 ]].\nRelated to [Va2, end of 6.2.2 C)], we could add that the forwarding to [Va2, 6.2.3]\nrefers to the logical version of loc. cit. over C. Related to the unramified part of the\nproof of [Va2, 6.4.5], we could add the reference to [Va2, 3.4.5.2] (as p > 2). It is not\nstated explicitly, but on [Va2, p. 495] the argument that g0 is not an outer automorphism\ndid use the hypothesis p > 2: there are no outer automorphisms of odd order of a simple,\nadjoint group G over C leaving invariant a parabolic subgroup P of G with the property\n580\n\n\fthat G/P is the dual of a hermitian symmetric domain; however if G/P is the dual of\nthe hermitian symmetric domain associated to SU (n, n)R or to SO(2, 2n \u2212 2)R , then we\ncan get such outer automorphisms of order 2. In the Fact of [Va2, 6.8.0] we could add\nthat the pro-finite group is as well abelian.\nAE.6.1. We could add to the theory of [Va2, 4.3], that in applications to Shimura\nvarieties of Hodge type, we need to consider only DVR's of mixed characteristic which\nare complete and have a residue field k which is the algebraic closure of a finite field and\nwe need to check just that condition [Va2, 4.3.5] holds (in a suitable context) for any\nO-algebra R which is local, integral, strictly henselian and has k as its residue field. This\nis so due to the fact that the rings Re and Re1 of [Va2, 5.2.17.1] have all these properties\n(cf. [Va2, 5.2.1.1] for the strictly henselian part). Moreover, based on [Va2, 4.3.7 5')\nand 6)] we can assume R is as well complete and excellent. Warning: the way the proof\nof [Va2, 4.3.10 b)] is organized (we assumed that G0 (M )R0 is already semisimple), we\nstill need to work in a reduced context (i.e. we still need to replace above integral by\nreduced).\n\n581\n\n\f582\n\n\fAppendix\n\nIt is desirable to make the connection between the present work and [RR]. There\nare three results here related to [RR]. They were obtained independently and their main\npart precedes [RR], cf. [Va1] and 1.15.10. These results are:\nA) The part of 3.1.0 expressed in 3.6.6.1 2). It is related to the main results of [RR,\nch. 3-4]. Loc. cit. obtains 3.6.6.1 2) (as well as its variant in a generalized Shimura\ncontext) in more general contexts. However our ideas work (without any change) to even\nmore general contexts (see below).\nB) 3.2.10 (FORM). Its idea is very much the same as of the general result [RR, 1.17].\nC) 4.5.4 and 4.5.6.1. The idea of 4.5.4 is the same underlying [RR, def. 3.3]. The\nProposition 4.5.6.1 is related to the main result 3.6 of [RR]. It can be used to restate\nthis main result in a simpler way, provided we restrict the class of groups. We use the\nnotations of [RR, ch. 2-3]. We have:\nThe Lie criterion (preliminary form). If all factors of Gad are of B3 , Cn\n(n \u2208 N), F4 or G2 Lie type, then for two points s1 , s2 of S, we have b\u0304(s1 ) = b\u0304(s2 ) iff the\nsequence of Newton polygons of the cyclic factors of the Lie isocrystal over s\u03041 (defined by\nLie(G) or, in the sense of [RR, 3.3], corresponding to the adjoint representation of G on\nits Lie algebra) is equal to the sequence of Newton polygons of the cyclic factors of the\nLie isocrystal over s\u03042 .\nThe proof of this is entirely the same as of 4.5.6.1: it is 2.2.24.1 (or [RR, 3.4 (i)])\nwhich allows us to use semisimple elements as in the proof of 4.5.6.1. The \"specialty\" of\nF4 and G2 Lie types (from which the part of the Criterion pertaining to them follows)\nis: if we order the positive roots w.r.t. a chosen basis of the root system of any of these\nLie types, on \"the top part\" we have a total ordering. To be quick, we explain what we\nmean by \"the top part\" directly in terms of the positive roots listed in [Bou2, planche\nVIII and IX]. We denote by > the ordering we referred to. For the G2 Lie type we have:\n3\u03b11 + 2\u03b12 > 3\u03b11 + \u03b12 > 2\u03b11 + \u03b12 > \u03b11 + \u03b12 .\nFor the F4 Lie type we have:\n2\u03b11 +3\u03b12 +4\u03b13 +2\u03b14 > \u03b11 +3\u03b12 +4\u03b13 +2\u03b14 > \u03b11 +2\u03b12 +4\u03b13 +2\u03b14 > \u03b11 +2\u03b12 +3\u03b13 +2\u03b14 .\nAll the above roots are > than all positive roots which are not mentioned.\nWe do not know when this criterion is true without its assumption on the Lie types\nof the simple factors of Gad ; 4.5.6.2 and the Fact of the proof of 4.5.6.1 point out that\n583\n\n\fthere are simple variants (the easiest ones are for the Bn Lie types; see 4.5.6.2 A) of\nthis criterion in many cases involving factors of Gad of An , Bn or Dn Lie types (n \u2265 2).\nIn practice it is easier to work with the above criterion (or variants of it) than with\nthe partial ordering on B(G) defined in [RR, 2.3]. Moreover, Exercise 4.5.6 4) points\nout that, from the point of view of stratifications, [RR, 3.6] brings nothing new to the\nspecialization theorem. Loc. cit. is just a restatement of the specialization theorem as\nprovided by [RR, 2.2] and by the Newton map as defined in [RR] (in particular it does\nnot represent a new proof of this theorem). [RR, ch. 1, 2.2, 2.4, 3.6-12] contains lots of\nuseful theoretical tools (for instance, the language is practical and the proof of [RR, 4.2]\nis short). Unfortunately, [RR] is of extremely little use w.r.t. the Real Problem of 1.6.5.\nAs a conclusion: the work of \u00a71-4 is integral and so more refined (handling deformation aspects and subtler things mod p, like 3.9 and 3.13) and more restricted (we work in\na context of good reduction and of generalized Shimura p-divisible objects), while [RR]\nworks rationally and so less refined but more general.\nHowever, the greatest part of the ideas and results presented in 3.6 can be used (i.e.\nextended) to even more general contexts. What follows (except Theorem 2 below) is an\nafterthought, suggested by [RR, 4.2]. Though 3.9.9 and 1) of 3.15.7 B point out that\na lot can be done in the non-smooth context, for the time being let's refer just to the\nsmooth one. We start with an arbitrary filtered \u03c3k -S-crystal\nC = (M\u0303 , (F i (M\u0303 ))i\u2208S(\u00e3+1,b\u0303) , \u03c6\u0303, G\u0303);\nwe do not assume that the W -condition holds for it or that G\u0303 is a reductive group (see\n3.6.1.5). We work with p \u2265 2. There are four steps in achieving this extension.\nStep 1. Part A. If the W -condition holds for C and G\u0303 is a quasi-split reductive\ngroup, then 3.2.3, 3.6.6, 3.6.6.0, 3.6.6.2 and the proof of 3.11.1 (relying on 3.4.11) remain\nvalid, with no essential change (besides the logical one in connection to the part of\n3.13.7.8 involving Nj 's, with j < 0). So the obstructions of proving 3.1.0, 3.4-5, 3.6.1.2-3\nand 3.11.1 in this context come just from:\n\u2013 3.6.8.9 (cf. the discussion in 3.6.1.6),\n\u2013 from 3.5.6,\n\u2013 and from 3.13.7.9 (cf. its end part postponing the general definition of Lie stable\np-ranks).\nThe obstruction coming from 3.5.6 is not a very serious one (as we expect 3.5.6 to be\na known result and), as it can be substituted (cf. 3.6.6.0) by the expectation of 3.6.1.6.\nMoreover, the obstruction coming from end of 3.13.7.9 is just for the time being. So\nthe serious obstruction is in achieving suitable global deformations of C, as predicted by\n3.6.1.6. We hope to come back to this in a future paper, as we think it is one of the most\nurgent thing needed to be \"sorted out\" in connection to Fontaine categories.\nHowever, from the point of Newton polygons, the \"lack of deformations\" can be\nsubstituted by the specialization theorem (or by loc. cit.). Let g0 \u2208 G(W (k)) be such\n584\n\n\fthat \u03c6\u03030 := g0 \u03c6\u0303 takes the Lie algebra of a Borel subgroup of G\u0303 into itself (this is as in\n3.2.3). As in 3.6.6 (cf. also 3.6.6.2) and 3.6.6.0 we get that there is an affine, open, dense\nU = Spec(R) of G\u0303 through which the origin of G\u0303 factors, such that for any u \u2208 U (W (k\u0304)),\nu(\u03c6\u03030 \u2297 1) and \u03c6\u03030 \u2297 1 are isomorphic under an isomorphism defined by an element of\nG\u0303(W (k\u0304)) which has the analogue shape of the element h of 3.13.7.8. We would like to\nadd just four extra things.\nT1. First, the fact that we use inner conjugations just by elements of G(W (k)) of\nthe mentioned shape, is irrelevant from the point of view of the proof of 3.6.6 (see the\nend of the paragraph before the Expectation of 3.13.7.8).\nT2. Second, it is irrelevant what shape the exponential maps have (cf. also end of\n3.14 A); in connection to the generalization of 3.6.6 the only important think is that the\nproperty IND of the proof of 3.6.6 still holds.\nT3. Third, in the proof of 3.6.6 the particular shape of parabolic subgroups involved\nplayed no role at all.\nT4. Fourth, the case when we have (see the proof of 3.6.6) |I0 | = 1 and I \u03030 = 3\n(so we are dealing with the D4 Lie type) is, as mentioned in 3.6.6.2, entirely the same\nas the case when we have |I0 | = 1 and I \u03030 = 2. The explicit checking of this is left as\nan exercise for the diligent reader. We just add: the case |I0 | = 1 and I \u03030 = 3 can be\nhandled easily as well by computers.\nThis goes as follows. We need to check that, for |I0 | = 1 and I \u03030 = 3, a suitable\nmorphism mU : \u0168 \u2192 U is such that its image has the right dimension. mU is either\nconstructed as the morphism mH of the proof of 3.6.6 or (which is even better) as the\norbit map of TH of 3.13.7.8 defined by the identity element of H(k). mU is the extension\nto k of a morphism mU,3 : \u0168Fp3 \u2192 UFp3 over Fp3 , and \u0168 is a connected, smooth group\nscheme of dimension less than 2(24 + 4) = 56 (see [Bou, planche IV] for the fact that the\ndimension of an absolutely simple adjoint group of D4 Lie type is 28); if we construct mU\nvia TH of 3.13.7.8, then we can replace 56 by 52 as well as below we can replace 55 by 51.\nMoreover, the number of possibilities for such morphisms mU is finite (as they depend\nonly on the choice of some parabolic subgroups of an absolutely simple, split, adjoint\ngroup over Fp3 of D4 Lie type) and each such morphism mU is defined by an orbit of a\ngroup action. Let c(mU ) \u2208 N be the number of connected components of the maximal\nreduced subgroup \u0168 st of \u0168 mapped by mU into a point. Let c \u2208 N be the maximum of\nall such possible c(mU )'s.\nLet q \u2208 N \\ {1, 2} be such that:\na) any reductive group over Fp3 of dimension at most 55 splits over Fpq and\nb) any \u00e9tale, finite, flat group scheme GS over Fp3 of rank at most c, over Fpq is\ndefined by an abstract group.\nIf any such morphism mU is not dominant, then the number N R(q) of Fpq -valued\n585\n\n\fpoints of \u0168Fst 3 is\np\n\n(P OIN T S)\n\nc(mU )P (pq )\n\nwhere P (x) is a polynomial with coefficients in Z which belongs to a finite list of polynomials of order of degree at least equal to dimk (\u0168 ) \u2212 dimk (U ) + 1. The finite list depends\nonly on the number 55 and is obtained easily by combining [Bo2, 21. 15-17] (see also\n[GLS, Table 2.2 of p. 39]) with the fact that the number of split, reductive groups over\nFpq of dimension at most 55 is finite, and with the fact that each reduced, connected,\naffine, algebraic group over Fpq is the semidirect product of a reductive group with a\nunipotent group which is obtained from Ga via short exact sequences. By choosing q big\nenough (depending only on c and on 55), it can be easily checked by computers that none\nof these possible expressions for N R(q) is the right one.\nLower bounds for such q's are effectively computable provided c is effectively computable. In practice is not very easy to compute c(mU )'s; however, (SES) of 3.13.7.1 can\nbe easily used to substitute b) by two other conditions b') and b\"). For b') we just need\nto add replace in b) \"of rank at most c\" by the requirement that GS has a normal series\nof length at most 55 whose factors are direct sums of Z/pZ. For b\") we just need to\nsubstitute in b) c by c\u2032 which is the maximum of effectively computable numbers c\u2032 (mU ).\nPart B. Either 3.15.7 BP2 or the estimates of [Ka2, 1.4-5] (to be compared as well\nwith 3.15.8 or with the proof of [Ka2, 2.3.1-2]) imply that there is n \u2208 N, not depending\non G\u0303, such that the Newton polygon of (M\u0303 \u2297W (k) W (k\u0304), h\u0303(\u03c6\u03030 \u2297 1)) depends only on the\nreduction mod pn of h\u0303 \u2208 G\u0303(W (k\u0304)). We can assume U is small enough so that we have\nan isomorphism\nmU : Spec(Wn (R/pR)) \u2192 UWn (k)\ninducing the natural identification on special fibres. We fix some h\u0303 \u2208 G(W (k)) and we\nconsider the following object of p \u2212 M(W (R/pR))\n(M\u0303 \u2297W (k) W (R/pR), huniv h\u0303(\u03c6\u03030 \u2297 1)),\nwith huniv \u2208 G\u0303(W (R/pR)) an element which mod pn is the universal element defined\nnaturally via mU . From the proof (of [Ka2, p. 143]) of the specialization theorem worked\njust mod pn and from the existence of U we get directly:\nTheorem 1. The Newton polygon of (M\u0303 \u2297W (k) , h\u0303\u03c6\u03030 )) is above the Newton polygon\nN P0 of (M\u0303 , \u03c6\u03030 ).\nTheorem 1 is equivalent to [RR, 4.2]. For future references we state here the following refinement of Theorem 1 for the generalized Shimura context. We assume C =\n(M\u0303 , (F i (M\u0303 ))i\u2208S(\u00e3+1,b\u0303) , \u03c6\u0303, G\u0303) is a generalized Shimura p-divisible object of MF[\u00e3,b\u0303] (W (k)).\nLet AG\u0303 , BG\u0303 , CG\u0303 and DG\u0303 be the subsets of G\u0303(W (k)) defined as in 3.1.3 and 3.2.10 (either\nTheorem 1 or the combination of the arguments of 3.7 with 3.15.6 D allows us to define\nAG\u0303 and BG\u0303 ).\n586\n\n\fTheorem 2. 1) We have: AG\u0303 = BG\u0303 = CG\u0303 = DG\u0303 g0 .\n2) g \u2208 G(W (k) belongs to these sets iff the (refined) Lie stable p-rank of (M\u0303 , g \u03c6\u03030 , G\u0303)\nis equal to the one of (M\u0303 , \u03c6\u03030 , G\u0303).\n3) If g \u2208 AG\u0303 , then there is a unique lift of (M\u0303 , g \u03c6\u03030 , G\u0303) such that the Shimura adjoint\nfiltered Lie \u03c3-crystal attached to it is of parabolic type (i.e. is Shimura-ordinary).\nThe proof of this is entirely the same as the implications of 3.2.4. We just need to\npoint out: either the deformation part of 3.15.6 or Theorem 1 implies that we can still use\nthe specialization part of 3.2.5-6 as for the context of Shimura \u03c3-crystals (cf. also 3.7).\nNo doubt, once the Faltings\u2013Shimura\u2013Hasse\u2013Witt invariants are defined (see 3.13.7.9), in\nconnection to Theorem 2, the extra hypothesis of being in a generalized Shimura context,\nwill be automatically removed.\nOne extra thing: if p \u2265 b\u0303 \u2212 \u00e3 + 2, then the Galois property of 4.8.2 holds in the\ngeneralized Shimura context of C: no arguments need to be changed, cf. the deformation\ntheory of 3.15.6 and [Fa2, th. 5]. In fact [CF] can be used to eliminate the assumption\np \u2265 b\u0303 \u2212 \u00e3 + 2 (we recall that 4.8.2 is stated with Qp -coefficients).\nStep 2. If the W -condition holds for C and G\u0303 is a reductive group which is not\nquasi-split, then 3.8 still applies. So, whenever we can define G\u0303-canonical lifts over k\u0304,\nthey are in fact defined over k. Moreover, there is g \u2208 G(W (k)) such that the Newton\npolygon of (M\u0303 , g \u03c6\u0303) is the same as the Newton polygon N P0 obtained as in Theorem 1\nbut for the pull back of C to k\u0304.\nStep 3. If the W -condition holds for C but G\u0303 is not a reductive group, we have to\nproceed as follows. For most problems (like isomorphisms classes, etc.) it matters only\nhow G\u0303\u2227 looks like. This, most common, reduces the problem to the case when G\u0303 is the\nextension of a reductive group by a nilpotent group. So to work out 3.4-5 and 3.6.6 in this\nsituation we have to combine the case of a reductive group with the case of a nilpotent\ngroup. For how this is accomplished see [Va5] (cf. 4.6.1 2)). Warning: from the point of\nview of Newton polygons, by giving up the condition that G\u0303 is smooth, we can assume\nG\u0303B(k) is reductive; however, from the point of subtler things (mod powers of p) we can\nnot make this assumption (to be compared with 3.9.7.2-3).\nStep 4. The last step is to deal with the case when the W -condition does not hold\nfor C (to be compared with 2.2.9 1) and 1')). This, at a first glance, looks as an obstacle\nin getting 3.4-5 and 3.6.6 in this context. However, if G\u0303 is reductive, Theorem 1 should\nbe provable in this context, either by using global deformations or by shifting the focus\nfrom C to\nLie(C) := (Lie(G\u0303), (F j (Lie(G\u0303))j\u2208S(L\u00e3,Lb\u0303) , \u03c6\u0303, G\u0303/Z(G\u0303)).\nHere L\u00e3, Lb\u0303 \u2208 Z, Lb\u0303 \u2265 L\u00e3, are the logical values; the quotient group G\u0303/Z(G\u0303) acts on\nLie(G\u0303) via inner conjugation. How \"successful\" we are (i.e. of what we achieved) in this\nshift of focus, can be read out from 2.2.16.5; for instance, if G\u0303/Z(G\u0303) is an adjoint group\nand if (Lie(Z(G\u0303)), \u03c6\u0303) has only slopes 0, then we are in the context of 1) or 2). We hope\nto come back to this step in a future paper.\n587\n\n\fAs an afterthought, we point out: using [RR] and unpublished work of T. Zink,\nin [We] it is also checked the density part of 4.2.1 involving its a) part, in the cases\nmentioned in 4.6.6 as well as in the case p = 2 of the A and C cases of [Ko2].\n\n588\n\n\fReferences\n\n[BBM] P.
