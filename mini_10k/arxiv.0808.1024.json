The compound\ncrystallizes in the tetragonal P4/nmm space group at 300 K and in the orthorhombic Cmma space\ngroup at 100 K; attempts to refine the low temperature data in the monoclinic P112/n space group\ndiverged. On the basis of both resistive and magnetic analyses the tetragonal to orthorhombic phase\ntransition can be located at T ~ 140 K.\n1. Introduction\nThe recent discovery of relatively high superconducting transition temperature (TC) in LaFeAs(O,F)\n[1] attracted much attention on the REFeAsO (RE = rare earth) class of compounds. These phases\ncrystallizes in the tetragonal system at room temperature and their structure is built up by two kinds\nof planar layers constituted of edge sharing tetrahedra stacked along the c-axis. The former layer is\nconstituted of tetrahedra centred by O with the RE at vertices (charge reservoir layer), whereas in\nthe latter Fe coordinates As (conducting layer).\nThe F- free compounds exhibit a magnetic transition around 140-150 K [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] due to the\ndevelopment of a commensurate antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin density wave (SDW) with a small\nmoment in the FeAs plane, as revealed by neutron diffraction analysis [3]. The arising of this\nmagnetic structure has been related to a structural transition; in LaFeAsO this phase transition has\nbeen investigated by means of both neutron [3] and synchrotron powder diffraction analysis [8]. In\nthe former case an abrupt structural distortion was observed at ~155 K, evidenced by the splitting of\nthe 220 diffraction peak, and the new structure was found to belong to the monoclinic P112/n space\ngroup. A subsequent synchrotron powder diffraction analysis led to the conclusion that the low\ntemperature phase crystallizes in the orthorhombic Cmma space group [8]. A synchrotron powder\ndiffraction analysis of the iso-structural NdFeAsO revealed a similar phase transition [9] that\nauthors relates to the occurrence of the orthorhombic structure, although the monoclinic one is not\nrule out.\nIn this work we report an investigation of the crystal structure of SmFeAsO at 100 K and 300 K\ncarried out by means of Rietveld refinement of high resolution synchrotron powder diffraction data.\nDetails concerning the preparation, the resistive and magnetic characterization of the sample are\ndescribed in detail in ref [10]. High resolution synchrotron powder diffraction analysis was carried\nout at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in Grenoble (France) at the BM1B\nbeamline. Data were collected at 300 K and 100 K (\u03bb = 0.50035 \u00c5; step = 0.008\u00b0 2\u03b8; angular range\n= 1.0 \u2013 40.5\u00b0 2\u03b8) and structural refinement was carried out applying the Rietveld method using the\nprogram FullProf [11]. The peak shape was modelled using a pseudo-Voigt function; in the final\ncycle the following parameters were refined: the scale factor; the zero point of detector; the\nbackground (six parameters of the 5th order polynomial function); the unit cell parameters; the\natomic displacement parameters; the peak shape, the Lorentzian isotropic strain and asymmetry\nparameters; the atomic site coordinates.\nThe diffraction data collected at 300 K were successfully refined in the tetragonal P4/nmm space\ngroup and the obtained structural data (reported in Table 1) are in excellent agreement with those\nreported in ref [10], obtained on the same sample, but by means of laboratory X-ray powder\ndiffraction analysis.\nIn both LaFeAsO and NdFeAsO phase transition is evidenced by the splitting of selected diffraction\npeaks, such as 220 and 322 [3,8,9]. In SmFeAsO no evident peak splitting can be detected\ncomparing the diffraction data collected at 300 K and 100 K, but a closer examination of these\npeaks reveals an anomalous broadening towards high angles in the data collected at low temperature\n(Figure 1). A good refinement using the data collected at 100 K can be obtained using the tetragonal\nP4/nmm space group structural model but a careful analysis of the plot evidences that the afore\nmention diffraction peaks are not well fitted (Figure 2, inset on the left). A notable improvement is\nobtained adopting the Cmma structural model (Figure 2, inset on the right), already successfully\n\n\fapplied in the case of LaFeAsO and NdFeAsO [8,9]. From the statistical point of view the two\nstructural models differ essentially in the number of parameter used to describe the structure. In\norder to check if the improvement obtained changing from P4/nmm to Cmma is not merely related\nto the addition of a new parameter (that is a \u2260 b), the significance test was carried out on the\ncrystallographic R factors [12]. As a result the improvement in the agreement between observed and\ncalculated structure amplitudes is significant and the orthorhombic structural model must be\npreferred.\nAttempts to refine the structure applying the monoclinic P112/n space group, as reported for\nLaFeAsO [3], led to a divergence of the refinement and thus this structural model can be ruled out.\nAs the orthorhombic structure takes place the Sm-As bond length splits with a notable decrease\nparallel to [100] (Table 2); conversely the remaining bond lengths as well as the geometry of both\nSmO and FeAs tetrahedra are not affected by the structural transition.\nIn conclusion SmFeAsO undergoes a tetragonal to orthorhombic phase transition on cooling;\nsimilarly to the LaFeAsO and NdFeAsO cases this structural change is likely to occur in the\ntemperature region where anomalies are observed in both resistive and magnetic curves [3,8]. In the\ncase of SmFeAsO it can be located at T ~ 140 K [10].\n\n\fTable 1: Strutural data of SmFeAsO obtained after Rietveld\ncollected at 300 K and 100 K.\n300 K\nSpace group\nP4/nmm\na (\u00c5)\n3.9390(1)\nCell edge\nb (\u00c5)\n/\nc (\u00c5)\n8.4980(1)\nx\ny\nz\nSm\n2c\n1\u20444\n1\u20444\n0.1372(1)\nWyckoff\nO\n2a\n3\u20444\n1\u20444\n0\nposition\nFe\n2b\n3\u20444\n1\u20444\n1\u20442\nAs\n2c\n1\u20444\n1\u20444\n0.6599(2)\nR-Bragg (%)\n7.48\nRf- factor (%)\n3.76\n\nrefinement using the diffraction data\n\n4g\n4a\n4b\n4g\n\nx\n0\n1\u20444\n1\u20444\n0\n\n100 K\nCmma\n5.5611(1)\n5.5732(1)\n8.4714(2)\ny\nz\n1\u20444\n0.1374(1)\n0\n0\n0\n1\u20442\n1\u20444\n0.6599(2)\n6.78\n3.65\n\nTable 2: Comparison among selected bond lengths in SmFeAsO at 300 K and 100 K.\n300 K\n100 K\nSm-O \u00d7 4 (\u00c5)\n2.289(1)\n2.287(1)\n3.273(1)\nSm-As \u00d7 4 (\u00c5)\n3.276(1)\n3.268(1)\nFe-As \u00d7 4 (\u00c5)\n2.393(1)\n2.389(1)\n\n\fFigure 1 (colour online): Evolution of the 220 and 322 diffraction peaks (tetragonal indexing) with\ntemperature (normalised data); anomalous broadening towards high angles can be detected in the\ndata collected at 100 K.\n\n\fFigure 2 (colour online): Rietveld refinement plot obtained using the data collected at 100 K and\napplying the orthorhombic Cmma structural model; the insets are enlarged views of the plots\nobtained using the Cmma and P4/nmm structural models in the regions of the 220 (~20.7\u00b0) and 322\n(~27.3\u00b0) diffraction peaks.\n\n\fReferences\n[1] Kamihara Y., Watanabe T., Hirano M., Hosono H. 2008 J.
