The term \"paradox\", however, is quite misleading, as all ramifications of the situation considered are well understood nowadays. Nevertheless, we use this term to sketch the basic situation of\nthis paper. While one of the twins, we will call him Eric,\nstays on Earth, the other twin, Tina, undertakes a relativistic trip to some distant location in the universe and\nimmediately returns home. In a previous work, M\u00fcller\net al.3 discussed this situation in flat Minkowski space\nfor a uniformly accelerating twin. There, the journey is\nseparated into four stages of equal time lengths. In the\nfirst two stages, Tina accelerates and decelerates again\nuntil she reaches her destination. In the last two stages,\nshe returns in exactly the same manner. As long as Tina\nvisits only a nearby star, the special relativistic treatment is a sufficient approximation. But, if a trip to some\nfar distant galaxies shall be considered, the expansion of\nspacetime must be taken into account.\nThe aim of this paper is to discuss the twin paradox\nsituation for a uniformly accelerating twin in de Sitter\nspacetime. Although our own universe is not a de Sitter\nspacetime, nevertheless this will reveal the new aspects\nof the twin paradox that come about in an expanding\nuniverse. As pointed out by Rindler4 it has the didactive merit that in it all the necessary integrations can\nbe performed in terms of elementary functions. We extend the calculations by Rindler to incorporate not only\nthe acceleration in one direction but also the complete\njourney. For very long acceleration times or very large\nHubble constants, the temporal course of the journey will\nthen differ significantly from the flat Minkowskian situation. Besides the worldline of the twin, we also study the\ninfluence of the expanding universe and the accelerated\n\nmotion on the communication between both twins.\nDetailed discussions of the structure of the de Sitter\nspace5,6 can be found in Hawking and Ellis7 , Schmidt8 ,\nor Spradlin et al.9 There are also some recent articles\nconcerning accelerated motion in de Sitter space. Bi\u010d\u00e1k\nand Krtou\u016110, for example, study accelerated sources in\nde Sitter space and give a list of several coordinate representations. Podolsk\u00fd and Griffiths11 discuss uniformly\naccelerating black holes in a de Sitter universe. From an\nother point of view, Doughty12 discusses the necessary\nacceleration in Schwarzschild spacetime to keep a fixed\ndistance to the black hole horizon.\nSome recent publications on uniform acceleration\nwithin special relativity are, for example, Semay13 ,\nwho presents a uniformly accelerated observer within a\nPenrose-Carter diagram, or Flores14 , who is concerned\nwith the communication between accelerated observers.\nThe structure of this paper is as follows. In Sec. II,\nwe briefly summarize the twin paradox journey in flat\nMinkowski space. In Sec. III, we introduce the form of\nthe de Sitter metric we use in this work and recapitulate\nsome properties needed for our discussion. In Sec. IV, we\nderive the worldline of a twin paradox journey in de Sitter\nspacetime and discuss the differences to the journey in\nMinkowski space. In Sec. V, we scrutinize the influence\nof the expansion onto the communication between both\ntwins.\n\nII.\n\nTWIN PARADOX IN FLAT SPACE\n\nIn flat Minkowski space, the twin paradox journey\nworks as follows. While Eric stays on Earth, Tina starts\nher trip with zero velocity and moves with uniform acceleration \u03b1. After proper time \u03c41 with respect to her\nown clock, she decelerates again with \u03b1 until she comes\n\n\f2\nto rest at proper time 2\u03c41 . Then, she immediately returns to Earth with the same procedure and reaches her\nbrother at 4\u03c41 . Here, and for the rest of this article, we\ndenote these four stages with the circled numbers 1\u20134.\nBecause the accelerations in the stages 2 and 3 point in\nthe same direction, each worldline is composed of three\nbranches. Branch a) describes stage 1, stages 2 and 3\nare combined into branch b), and stage 4 is represented\nby branch c), see Fig. 1.\n\n0\n\n}|\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u03b1\n1\n\n{z\n\n\u03c41\n\n2\n\n}|\n\u2190\n\u2212\n\u03b1\n\n\u03c42\n\nc)\n\n3\n\n{z\n\n\u03c43\n\n}|\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u03b1\n\n{\n\nPSfrag replacements\n\u03c4\n\n4\n\nCoordinate distance r [light years]\n\nb)\n\na)\n\nz\n\n180\n\n\u03c44\n\n160\n140\n120\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n\n0\n\n2.5\n\n\u03c41\n\n7.5\n\n\u03c42\n\n12.5\n\n\u03c43\n\n\u03c44\n\n17.5\n\nTina's proper time \u03c4 [years]\n\nFIG. 1.

In each stage, she accelerates\nor decelerates with \u03b1 = 9.81 m/s2 \u2248 1.0326 ly/y2 for a\ntime \u03c41 = 5 y. Thus, her journey lasts 4\u03c41 = 20 y. On\nEarth, however, t(4\u03c41 ) \u2248 338.36 y pass by, as can easily\nbe calculated from Eq. (1c). The maximum coordinate\ndistance, rmax , Tina can reach with this procedure, is\ngiven by Eq.

(1) and\n(2)), is a special case for H \u2192 0 of the more general\nworldline in de Sitter space. In order to show the similarity of the respective expressions, we rewrite Eqs. (19a)\nand (20a) and obtain\n!\nc2 eq\u03c4 + e\u2212q\u03c4 \u2212 2\n1\n2 + \u03b6(\u03c4 )\n,\nr(\u03c4 ) =\n, t(\u03c4 ) =\nln\n2\n\u03b1\n2 + \u03b6(\u03c4 )\nH\n2q 2 \u03b1c 2\n(23)\nwith\n\u03b6(\u03c4 ) = H\n\n\u0001\nc2\nSeq\u03c4 \u2212 De\u2212q\u03c4 .\n2\n\u03b1\n\n(24)\n\nIn this section we consider a simple trip, where Tina\nchooses her acceleration and deceleration times equally\nlong, i.e. \u03c43 = 3\u03c41 . As in flat space we choose\n\u03c41 = 5 y. To illustrate the influence of the expansion during such a short trip, we choose an extremely\nlarge Hubble constant. Specifically, we consider the cases\nH = {107 H0 , 108 H0 , 109 H0 }, where H0 is the Hubble\nconstant of our universe, cf. Eq. (25).\nFigure 7 shows Tina's radial coordinate r(\u03c4 ) during\nthese journeys. Even for a Hubble constant that is 107\ntimes larger than that of our universe, the expansion\nhas only minor influence on the course of Tina's journey, cf. Fig. 2. In that case, she reaches her maximum\nradial coordinate distance r \u2248 149.06 ly at proper time\n\u03c4 \u2248 9.8898 y. After 4\u03c41 = 20 y, however, she has not\nreturned yet, because r \u2248 1.9511 ly. It is not surprising, that r(\u03c44 ) > 0. As the spacetime expands, Tina\ncannot return to Earth on these journeys. Besides that,\nthere are several other differences to Minkowski space.\nFigure 8 shows the elapsed coordinate time t(\u03c4 ) during\nthe same trips. The expansion rate has a strong influence\non time dilatation. As we have shown in Eq. (18), the\nmaximum possible velocity \u03b2\u221e and the maximum value\n\u03b3\u221e of t\u2032 become smaller when H increases. The same is\nalso true for a round trip. Thus, time dilatation is the\nsmaller, the larger the expansion rate is. In Table I, r\u221e\nand \u03b3\u221e are compared for the expansion rates considered\nhere. In Fig. 9, Tina's velocity \u03b2 = v/c during her trip is\nshown. Clearly, \u03b2 = 0 already for some time \u03c4 < 2\u03c41 and\n\u03b2 6= 0 at the end of the trip. In Table II, the elapsed coordinate times t(\u03c44 ) after these journeys and the respective\njourney in Minkowski space, as well as the coordinate\ndistance r(\u03c44 ), the proper distance l(\u03c44 ), and the velocity \u03b2(\u03c44 ) are compared.

To perform a proper round\ntrip, we must find the duration of stage 2 necessary for\na given stage 1 such that, at its end, Tina is at rest\nagain. Then, stages 3 and 4 have to be chosen in such\na way that she returns to Earth and arrives there with\nzero velocity.\nWhen Tina is at rest, we have t\u2032 = 1. With Eq. (13b)\nwe can use this condition to calculate \u03c4rest and obtain\n\u03c4rest =\n\n250\n\n200\n\nS\n1\nln\nq A\u03c41 D\n\n(26)\n\nfor the duration of stages 1 + 2.

From\nflat\nreplacements\n\u22120.75 107H\nspace, one would expect that t(4\u03c41 ) = 2t(2\u03c41 ). Thus, the\n0\n1089H0\ntime\nt [years]\nelapsed coordinate time after stage 4 Coordinate\nis twice the\ntime\n10 H0\n\u22121\nafter stage 2, but here this is different.\n\u03c41\n\u03c42\n\u03c43\n\u03c44\n\u03c4\n2.5\n7.5\n12.5\n17.5\nTina's proper time \u03c4 [years]\nThe reason for these discrepancies are the different times\nTina needs to accelerate to reach a certain velocity, and\nFIG. 9. Velocity \u03b2 = v/c for the same trip as in Fig. 7.\nthe time Tina needs to decelerate to come to rest again.\nContrary to flat space \u03b2 6= 0 for \u03c4 = 20 y.\nWe will evaluate this further in the next section.\n\n\f7\nthat\n\u03c4rest < 2\u03c41 .\n\n(27)\n\nThus, in de Sitter space stage 2 is always shorter than\nstage 1.\nIn the limit \u03c41 \u2192 \u221e, we obtain\nlim (\u03c4rest \u2212 \u03c41 ) =\n\n\u03c41 \u2192\u221e\n\nS\n1\nln\nq H\n\n(28)\n\nfor the duration of stage 2. Thus, the time needed to\ncome to rest after accelerating for arbitrarily long times\nhas an upper boundary!\n4.\n\nMaximum acceleration time\n\nIf Tina accelerates too long in the beginning of her trip,\nshe can no longer return home to Earth afterwards. The\ncondition for a possible return is l(\u03c4rest ) < r\u221e for Tina's\nproper distance at the end of stage 2.\nTo make this point clear, we assume Tina is on a journey and has covered a proper distance l(\u03c4rest ) = r\u221e . A\ntransformation to new coordinates\nt 7\u2192 t \u2212 t(\u03c4rest ),\n\nr 7\u2192 [r \u2212 r(\u03c4rest )]eHt(\u03c4rest ) ,\n\n(29)\n\nputs the previous expansion of the universe into the\ndefinition of our new coordinates. This transformation\nmakes sense because of the form of the expansion factor,\nR(t) = eHt . Hence, we have R(tb )/R(ta ) = R(tb \u2212 ta )\nfor arbitrary ta and tb , see also Tolman.18 Thus, current\nproper distances in the old coordinates again equal coordinate distances in the new coordinates and the equations\nof motion are the same in the new coordinates.\nIn these new coordinates, Tina's current position is\nr = 0 and Earth is located at rEarth = r\u221e . Therefore, she\ncan no longer return home. Hence the set of all particles\nat rest at different radial coordinates r can be divided\ninto four subsets at the beginning of the journey:\n1. Particles beyond Tina's future light cone.\n2. Particles, which Tina cannot reach because they\nhave r \u2265 r\u221e .\n3. Particles, which Tina can reach but where she cannot return to Earth afterwards, because when she\narrives there, her proper distance to Earth is larger\nthan r\u221e .\n\nat the end of stage 2. Note that Eq. (30) is not a conditional equation for \u03c4rest but for \u03c41max , with \u03c4rest =\n\u03c4rest (\u03c41max )! Solving this equation yields\n\u0012 \u0013\n1\nS\n\u03c41max = ln\n.\n(31)\nq\nH\nRound trips are only possible for \u03c41 < \u03c41max . For longer\nacceleration times Tina cannot return to Earth. Using\nEq. (31), we further obtain\n!\n2\n1\nS Hq + \u03b1c2 \u2212 H 2\n\u03c4restmax = \u03c4rest (\u03c41max ) = ln\n.\nq\nD\n2H 2\n(32)\nFor H = H0 we obtain \u03c41max = 22.6463 y and\n\u03c4rest (\u03c41max ) = 45.2773 y. For details on the calculation\nsee App. D.\nThis situation can easily be illustrated using CE coordinates. To receive Tina's worldline [\u03b7(\u03c4 ), \u03c7(\u03c4 )] for\ninfinitely long acceleration and on a round trip, we insert Eqs. (19a), (20a) and (19), (20), respectively, into\nEq. (5b). Details on the calculation of \u03c43 and \u03c44 for a\nsuitable round trip are given in the next section. Figure 10 shows Tina's worldline on a round trip (rt) with\n\u03c41 = (1 \u2212 10\u22128 )\u03c41max , her worldline on a one-way trip\n(owt) where she accelerates away from Earth for all times,\nand her future light cone at time t = 0 (lc) for a universe\nwith H = 5 \u00d7 109 H0 . In addition, the worldlines of particles at rest at Tina's event horizon reh = c/H for t = 0,\ncf. Eq. (8), at the \u03b1-horizon r\u221e and at rmax \u2261 r(\u03c4restmax )\nare depicted. Here, the particle at rmax has the smallest\ndistance, that Tina cannot reach on a round trip.\nWith Eqs. (30) and (32) we arrive at\nrmax = r\u221e e\u2212Ht(\u03c4restmax ) .\n\n(33)\n\nFor H = 5 \u00d7 109 H0 we obtain rmax = 0.40067r\u221e, for the\ngeneral expression see App. E. Tina's future light cone\nintersects the worldline of the particle at the event horizon (eh) at \u03b7 = 0, \u03c7eh = \u03c0/2. Thus, this is the boundary\nparticle of region 2 of particles Tina can send light signals\nto at time t = 0. Equally, the worldline for a trip with\ninfinitely long acceleration (owt) intersects the worldline\nof the particle at r\u221e at \u03b7 = 0, \u03c7\u221e = arctan [\u03b1/(Hc)],\nwhich borders region 3. On a round trip (rt) with \u03c41\nvery close to \u03c41max , Tina almost reaches the particle at\nrmax , which is the boundary particle of region 4 of possible destinations for round trips starting at t = 0.\n\n4. Particles, which Tina can reach with l < r\u221e and\nwhere she therefore can return to Earth afterwards.\nFor times of departure t0 6= 0 the same classification\ncan be made by replacing coordinate distances via r \u2192\nre\u2212Ht0 .\nTo find the maximum acceleration time \u03c41max that allows\nTina to return home, we calculate the acceleration time\nfor which Tina has exactly covered a proper distance\nl(\u03c4rest ) = eHt(\u03c4rest ) r(\u03c4rest ) = r\u221e ,\n\n(30)\n\n5.\n\nA suitable round trip\n\nIn this section, we study how long Tina has to choose\nstages 3 and 4, to reach Earth again and come to rest\nthere at the end of her journey. The only difference between the outward trip and the return trip is the larger\nexpansion factor R[t(\u03c4rest )] instead of R(0) = 1.

(30) for l, where the factor eHt and the\nrestriction on d = r\u221e nicely simplify the occurring expressions. Therefore, this equation can only be treated\nnumerically.\nThe effects of expansion become especially clear for journeys with acceleration times close to \u03c41max .\nAs an example,\nwe consider a universe\nwith H = 109 H0 .\nFrom Eq. (31) we obtain\n\u03c41max = 2.597 y in this case.\nFor our discussion,\nwe consider three journeys, with acceleration times\n\u03c41 = {0.99\u03c41max, 0.9999\u03c41max, 0.99999\u03c41max} in stage 1.\nIn Table III, these journeys are compared with respect\nto Tina's and Eric's elapsed times and Tina's maximum\ncoordinate and proper distances at the end of stage 2.\nAs the duration of stage 1 is chosen very close to the\nmaximum acceleration time, the time needed to return\nvaries strongly with minimally different durations for\nstage 1.\nFigures 11\u201314 show \u03b2(\u03c4 ), t(\u03c4 ), r(\u03c4 ), and l(\u03c4 ) for these\ntrips.\n\n\u03c42,1\n\u03c42,2\n\u03c42,3\n\nFIG. 11.\nVelocity \u03b2(\u03c4 ) for journeys with acceleration\ntimes \u03c41 = 0.99\u03c41max (trip 1), 0.9999\u03c41max (trip 2), and\n0.99999\u03c41max (trip 3).

Finally, all particles\nwith r < rmax (region 4), are possible destinations for a round\ntrip starting at t = 0.\n\n\u03c41,1\n\u03c41,2\n\u03c41,3\n\nFIG. 12. Coordinate time t for the same journeys as in Fig. 11.\n\nTina has to travel with very high velocity for a very\nlong time on her way home, thus causing a large time\ndilatation, see Fig. 11. Therefore, the elapsed coordinate\ntime after the trip also increases strongly with minimal\nincrease in initial acceleration time, see Fig. 12. The\ncomparison of Figs. 13 and 14 shows the minor meaning\nof the r-coordinate as a measure of distance. For most of\nthe return trip Tina's radial coordinate distance to Earth\nis very small.

Proper distance l for the same journeys as in Fig. 11.\n\ncan easily be reproduced by setting \u03c4 = 2\u03c41 in Eq. (2b).\nWhen Tina has reached her destination, however, t \u2248\n1.37 \u00d7 1010 y have elapsed for Eric.\nIn a de Sitter universe the expansion has an extremely\nlarge effect during such a long trip, as is easily seen by\nevaluating\nr\u221e = 1.38696 \u00d7 1010 ly,\n\n(35)\n\nfor H = H0 . Thus, the galaxies considered in flat space\nare out of reach for Tina, in fact they are beyond the\n\nevent horizon, which differs only minimally from r\u221e in\nthis case, as \u03b1/c \u226b H0 , cf. the last paragraph in\nSec. IV A. Therefore, we consider the quasar19 3C 324\nwith a distance of approximately 1.21 \u00d7 1010 ly (This is\nthe distance a light ray emitted today would travel to\nthe quasar if the expansion of the universe stopped today). As less distant destinations we use the Andromeda\nGalaxy, which is approximately 2.56 \u00d7 106 ly away, see\ne.g. McConnachie,20 the quasar21 3C 273 with a distance\nof approx. 2.44 \u00d7 109 ly and the quasar22 3C 147, which\nis approx. 6.44 \u00d7 109 ly away.\nTable IV shows how long Tina has to choose stage 1\nto reach these destinations in Minkowski space. To make\nthe comparison with de Sitter space easier, we also list\nthe times \u03c42 = 2\u03c41 , \u03c43 = 3\u03c41 , and \u03c44 = 4\u03c41 at the end\nof the respective stages. We also list how much time has\nelapsed for Eric when Tina has reached her destination,\nand when she has returned to Earth. Table V shows the\nsame numbers in de Sitter space with H = H0 . Because\nof the expansion, stage 1 is longer than in flat space.\nStage 2, however, is almost equally long as in flat space\nas Tina can decelerate more quickly than she accelerates,\nsee Sec. IV B 3. The same is also true for the return\njourney, even to some greater extent.\nFor a trip to the Andromeda galaxy and even to the\nquasar 3C 273, the deviation from the flat space journey\nis very small. At these destinations, Tina's proper distance to Earth is still well less than r\u221e . For the quasar\n3C 147, the deviations are very large, especially when\ncomparing Eric's elapsed time in both spacetimes. This\nquasar is almost at the maximum distance that allows\nTina to return to Earth, when she arrives there, her\nproper distance to Earth is l \u2248 0.86680r\u221e.\nFor 3C 324, only a one way trip is possible, Tina cannot\nreturn to Earth afterwards. Also, Tina has to choose\nstage 1 more than two years longer than in flat space.\nAs she moves at the highest velocity during these two\nyears, this rather small difference in acceleration time\ncauses a huge difference on the trip. If Tina accelerates\nfor the same time \u03c41 = 24.48999 y in Minkowski space,\nshe covers a distance of r = 9.30827 \u00d7 1010 ly at the end\nof stage 2, which is almost eight times the distance with\n\u03c41 = 22.51183 y.\nThe huge influence of these additional two years\ncan also be seen by comparing Eric's elapsed times in\nMinkowski space and de Sitter space.

The quasar\n3C 324 is close to Tina's future light cone.\n\nV.\n\nrL [t(\u03c4 )] = r(\u03c4 ).\n\nCOMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE TWINS\n\nWe imagine that Eric and Tina permanently send each\nother information about their respective current time \u03c4\nor t. We study this situation both from Tina's and Eric's\nperspective. Concretely, we investigate when a signal,\nsent by Eric at time tS , will be received by Tina, and\nwhen a signal that Eric receives at time tR was sent by\nTina. For Tina, we calculate the respective times \u03c4S and\n\u03c4R . Again, we compare our results with Minkowski space.\n\nObviously Tina can only receive messages that Eric sends\nat times tS < c/\u03b1.\nLight signals sent by Tina at her proper time \u03c4S are\ndescribed by\nrL (t) = rflat (\u03c4S ) + ctflat (\u03c4S ) \u2212 ct\n\u0001\nc2 \u03b1 \u03c4 S\n=\ne c \u2212 1 \u2212 ct,\n\u03b1\n\n(39)\n\nwhere we have used Eqs.

In this case we\nobtain\n\u0001\nc \u0010\nc \u03b1 \u03c4S\n\u03b1 \u0011\n\u03c4S = ln 1 + tR , tR =\n(40)\nec \u22121 .\n\u03b1\nc\n\u03b1\n\nHence, Eric can receive every signal from Tina.\nFor radially moving light signals in de Sitter space,\n(\u03b8, \u03c6 = const), we have with Eq. (4)\ndr = \u00b1ce\u2212Ht dt.\n\n(41)\n\nLight signals sent by Eric are moving outward (dr > 0),\nsignals sent by Tina have dr < 0. Thus, light signals sent\nby Eric at time tS are described via\n\u0001\nc \u2212HtS\n(42)\n\u2212 e\u2212Ht ,\ne\nrL (t) =\nH\n\n\f11\nwhere the constant of integration is chosen such that\nr(tS ) = 0.\nTina receives these signals, when\n(43)\n\nInserting Eq.

For H \u2192 0 we further obtain\nPSfrag replacements\nc\n(47)\nlim tSmax = ,\nH\u21920\n\u03b1\nin accordance with the result for flat space.\nThe dependence of tS on H is very weak. For a universe\nwith H = H0 we find a deviation for tSmax around 1 :\n10\u221221 from the flat space result, for H = 109 H0 it is still\nonly a difference of 1 : 8.1 \u00d7 10\u22124 . This is not surprising\nas we are on a very small timescale compared to times\nwhere the expansion has a measurable effect.\nIn Minkowski space every signal sent by Tina eventually reaches Eric. In de Sitter space this is not true,\nsince Tina eventually crosses Eric's event horizon. Tina's\nsignals in de Sitter space are described via\n\u0011\nc \u0010 \u2212Ht\nrL (t) =\n(48)\ne\n\u2212 e\u2212Ht(\u03c4S ) + r(\u03c4S ),\nH\ninstead of Eq. (39) and by the expressions in Eqs.

(40).\nWhen Tina crosses Eric's event horizon, tR diverges.\nHence, we can use it to calculate the respective proper\ntime by setting the argument of the logarithm equal to\nzero.

(16) and (17) we look at Eric's perspective in a\nMinkowski space and a de Sitter space with H = 109 H0 .\nFor signals sent by Eric, the effect of the expansion is hard\nto recognize. For signals which he receives from Tina, the\nexpansion has a large effect, when Tina approaches his\nevent horizon and eventually moves behind it.\n\u03c4S(t) in de Sitter space\n\u03c4S(t) in Minkowski space\n\n6\n\n5\n\n4\n\u03c41eh\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\nEric's proper time t [years]\n\nFIG. 16. Eric's perspective: In Minkowski space, Eric has\nto wait very long for messages from Tina, but eventually he\nreceives all signals from her. In de Sitter space (H = 109 H0 ),\nEric cannot receive signals that Tina has sent after \u03c41eh . For\nall times, he therefore receives messages that Tina has sent at\nsome earlier time.\n\nB.\n\nCommunication during a round trip\n\nTo study communication during a round trip, the complete worldline of Tina has to be considered. The results are analogous to those in the preceding section. We\npresent figures to illustrate this situation and omit the\nexplicit mathematical expressions. For flat space, this\nproblem was already considered by M\u00fcller3 especially for\na flight to Vega.\nAgain we consider a trip with stage 1 of \u03c41 =\n0.99999\u03c4max in a universe with H = 109 H0 and a trip\nin a flat universe with equally long stages 1\u20134 for comparison.\nThis time we consider the situation from Tina's perspective.

Eric's perspective: As Tina accelerates away from\nEric, only messages that he sends before t = c/\u03b1 in Minkowski\nspace and before t = tSmax from Eq. (46) in de Sitter space\n(H = 109 H0 ) can reach Tina. To show the effect of the expansion the region around tSmax is also shown enlarged. Only\nsignals sent at times t . tSmax are received significantly later\nin de Sitter space. For t \u2208 [tSmax , c/\u03b1) communication is only\npossible in Minkowski space.\n\n2\n\nFor H = 109 H0 , however, the deviations are very large\nbecause Tina's signal has to travel a larger proper distance to reach Eric.\n\nVI.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nIn this work we have studied the extension of the twin\nparadox to de Sitter space. We showed that an expanding space time has a huge influence on long journeys,\nand we were able to quantitatively compare journeys in\nthis spacetime with their counterparts in flat space concerning the duration of the respective journeys, the possibility of communication during the journeys, and the\nlimitations that exist for round trips due to the expand-\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n\u03c43\n\n\u03c44\n\nFIG. 18. Tina's perspective in Minkowski space: At the\nproper time \u03c4 of Tina, the coordinate time is t = t(\u03c4 ). A\nsignal Tina receives at this time was emitted by Eric at time\ntS (\u03c4 ), and a signal she emits at that time will be received by\nEric at time tR (\u03c4 ).\n\nEric's proper time t [years]\n\nTina receives very few signals at the beginning of her\njourney. This is easy to understand, as she accelerates\naway from Earth, the travel time of Eric's signals increases rapidly and time dilatation additionally increases\nthis effect. When she decelerates and starts to return\nto Earth, the rate of received signals increases. On the\nother hand most of her signals reach Eric only shortly before she herself returns to Earth. The difference between\nthe journeys in Minkowski space and de Sitter space is\nthe large period in de Sitter space, where the rate of\nreceived signals remains constant for Tina and also for\nPSfrag replacements\nEric. Also, in flat space the travel time of the incoming\nlightray equals the travel time of the outgoing lightray,\nas they have to cover the same distance. Thus, in Fig. 18\nwe always have\n(51)\n\n\u03c42\n\nTina's proper time \u03c4 [years]\n\n160\n\ntR (\u03c4 ) \u2212 t(\u03c4 ) = t(\u03c4 ) \u2212 tS (\u03c4 ).\n\n4\n\n\u03c41\n\ntS(\u03c4)\ntR(\u03c4)\nt(\u03c4)\n\n140\n120\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n0\n\n2\n\n\u03c41\n\n4\n\n\u03c42\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\nTina's proper time \u03c4 [years]\n\n16\n\n\u03c43\n\n18\n\n20\n\n\u03c44\n\nFIG. 19. Same situation as in Fig. 18 but in de Sitter space\nwith H = 109 H0 .\n\ning spacetime, which can make a return to the point of\ndeparture impossible.\nBecause of its simple structure the de Sitter spacetime\nallows for extensive analytical calculations. The generalization of the investigations presented in this paper\nto more realistic spacetimes would be highly desirable.\nSince for such spacetimes not even the worldline can be\ndetermined analytically, all calculations would have to be\nperformed numerically. Clearly, the results obtained for\nthe twin paradox in de Sitter spacetime can serve as a\nguide in such calculations. ------------\n---------\u2013\n\n\f13\nAppendix A: Hyperbolic motion in Minkowski space\n\nIn flat Minkowski space, the four-acceleration a\u03bc , see\nEq.
