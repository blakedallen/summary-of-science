The zero field (\u03bc0 H = 0 T) resistivity shows\na sudden jump at TN\n\nand a small bump around Tmax = 220 K (>TN ).\n\nTN shifts down and Tmax shifts up with increasing \u03bc0 H. Magnetoresistance\nas high as -45-57 % at 7 T is found in the temperature range 180 K-230 K.\nIsothermal measurements indicate that the field induced antiferromagnetic\nto ferromagnetic transition below TN is accompanied by a rapid decrease of\nthe resistivity but increase of volume (\u2206V/V = +0.25 % at 180 K and 13.7\nT). This lattice coupled magnetoresistance transition is suggested due to the\nfield induced structural transition from the low volume orthorhombic to the\nhigh volume tetragonal structure.\n\nTypeset using REVTEX\n1\n\n\fExtensive studies following the discovery of a magnetic field induced destruction of the\nantiferromagnetic insulating phase in Pr0.5 Sr0.5 MnO3 revealed that the low temperature insulating phase is actually a two dimensional ferromagnetic metal but with successive ferromagnetic planes coupled antiferromagnetically1,2 . This peculiar type of antiferromagnetism\nknown as A-type antiferromagnetism is caused by two dimensional ordering of the JahnTeller split eg -dx2 \u2212y2 orbitals of Mn3+ ions. When heated from the low temperature, the\ninterplanar antiferromagnetic coupling becomes weak and Pr0.5 Sr0.5 MnO3 transforms into\na ferromagnetic metal in the temperature range 145- 270 K before changing into a paramagnetic insulator. There are indications that ferromagnetic domains from nano to micron size coexist with the antiferromagnetic phase even far below the Neel temperature in\nPr0.5 Sr0.5 MnO3 by NMR3 and magnetic studies4 . With increasing Sr content the strength\nof A-type antiferromagnetic interaction increases at the expense of the ferromagnetic interaction and finally A-type antiferromagnetism gives away to the C-type antiferromagnetism\nin Pr0.3 Sr0.7 MnO3 5,6 . The A-type antiferromagnetism is so far not observed for x <0.5 to in\nany of the RE1\u2212x AEx MnO3 (RE is a trivalent rare earth ion and AE is a divalent alkaline\nearth ion) series. Although there are few electrical transport studies in the A-type antiferromagnetic compounds away x = 0.55,7,8 , there is hardly any study on magnetotransport in\nthe A-type antiferromagnetic compounds away from half doping5,7 . Kuwahara et al7 found\nthat the out plane resistivity in Nd0.45 Sr0.55 MnO3 is 4 orders of magnitude higher than the\nin plane value at 45 mK and the in plane resistivity at \u03bc0 H = 10 T and 45 mK is an order of\nmagnitude lower than the out of plane resistivity. However, it is not known whether lattice\ndistortion plays any role in the magnetoresistance of the A-type antiferromagnet. In order to\ninvestigate this aspect we have chosen Pr0.46 Sr0.54 MnO3 which is an A-type antiferromagnet\nand shows a large magnetoresistance close to the Neel temperature? . To clarify this aspect\nwe carried out magnetostriction measurement on Pr1\u2212x Srx MnO3 (x = 0.54, 0.55). We also\ninvestigated Pr0.45 Sr0.55 MnO3 but a detailed study was discarded because a magnetic field\nmore for \u03bc0 H = 14 T which is beyond our experimental limit was needed to induce an\nantiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic transition.\n2\n\n\fWe measured four probe resistivity of the polycrystalline Pr0.46 Sr0.54 MnO3 over a wide\ntemperature (10 K- 320 K) and field ( 0 T \u2264 H \u2264 7 T) range using a Quantum Design\nPhysical Properties Measuring System. Magnetic measurements were carried out using a\nQuantum Design SQUID magnetometer. In the ac susceptiblity measurement the amplitude of ac signal was 3 Oe and the frequency was 100 Hz. Magnetostriction measuremnts\nusing the strain gauge method in a pulsed field up to13.7 T was measured at University of\nZaragoza, Spain. We measured both parallel (\u03bbpar ) and perpendicular (\u03bbper ) magnetostrictions with field parallel and perpendicular to the measuring directions respectively. The\nvolume magnetostriction of randomly oriented polycrystallites is determined through the\nrelation \u03c9 = \u03bbpar +2\u03bbper\nFig. 1 (a) shows the real (\u03c7') and imaginary (\u03c7\") parts of the ac susceptibility while\nwarming from 10 K. Both \u03c7' and \u03c7\" exhibit a peak around TN = 215 K due to A-type antiferromagnetic to paramagnetic transition. The paramagnetic to antiferromagnetic transition\nwhile cooling occurs at TN = 210 K but the data is not shown for clarity. The antiferroparamagnetic transition is accompanied by orthorhombic (Fmmm) to tetragonal (I4/mcm)\nstructural transition as revealed by neutron diffraction study9 . The inverse susceptibility is\nshown on the right scale. The low temperature anomaly in the inverse susceptibility (1/\u03c7')\naround 50 K is possibly related to ordering of the Pr moments and above TN , 1/\u03c7'obeys the\nCurie-Weiss law with a positive Weiss temperature \u03b8p = 230 K and an effective moment of\nPef f = 7.1837 \u03bcB . The experimentally observed value of Pef f is higher than the theoretically\nq\n\ncalculated value of Pef f = 0.46P2Pr3+ + 0.46P2Mn3+ + 0.54P2Mn4+ = 5.004 \u03bcB where P2Pr3+ =\n12.816, P2Mn3+ = 24, P2Mn4+ = 15. Judging from the earlier magnetization and resistivity data\nin Pr1\u2212x Srx MnO3 series? a short range ferromagnetic ordering with TC \u2248220 K is not an\nunlikely possibility in x = 0.54. The closeness of TC to TN makes it difficult to distinguish\nin x = 0.54 from the susceptibility data alone. A strong ferromagnetic correlations exist\nmuch above the TC as suggested by the high effective magnetic moment value. When the\nstrength of the external magnetic field increases, ferromagnetic correlations becomes much\n3\n\n\fstronger and TC shifts up in temperature. This is reflected in Fig. 1(b) which shows the\ninverse dc susceptibility (H/M) while field cooling for different H values over 320K-160 K.\nThe curves for different H do not match in the paramagnetic region over a wide temperature range (200 K- 300 K). The short range ferromagnetic ordering is also reflected in the\nM(H) isotherms in Fig. 1(c) at T = 215 K, 220 K, and 225 K. As T is reduced below 210\nK, antiferromagnetic correlations overcome ferromagnetic contributions. At 210 K, M(H)\nincreases initially increases linearly with the field but then raises rapidly around \u03bc0 Hc = 1.2\nT. The rapid increase of M(H) signals antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic transition. The\ntransition is first order as suggested by the hysteresis behavior. As T decreases further \u03bc0 Hc\nincreases to rapidly to 4.0 T at 200 K.\nFig. 2(a) shows temperature dependence of the resistivity \u03c1(T) for H.= 0 T and 7 T. \u03c1(T)\nincreases gradually as T is lowered below 320 K and exhibits a bump around Tmax = 220\nK as shown in the inset . Then, \u03c1(T) jumps up around TN = 210 K and then continues to\nincrease.. The value of \u03c1(T) at 4.2 K is very small (\u224830.0 m\u03a9 cm) which is slightly larger than\nthe in plane resistivity at 4.2 K (\u2248 10 m\u03a9 cm) of the single crystal A-type antiferromagnet\nNd0.45 Sr0.55 MnO3 7 . The weak bump at Tmax is caused by the short range ferromagnetic\norder? . The Tmax is shifted up to more than 300 K and TN is shifted down to 184 K\nunder \u03bc0 H = 7 T. Fig. 2(b) shows \u03c1(T) curves while cooling and warming under a field for\ndifferent values of H over a limited temperature range. The \u03c1(0T) curve exhibits hysteresis\nof 5 K width during the paramagnetic (tetragonal) to antiferromagnetic (orthorhombic)\nwhile cooling and the reverse transition upon warming. We take the middle point of the\nhysteresis region as the Neel temperature for convenience. When the field is increased TN\nsystematically shifts down and Tmax shifts up as shown in Fig. 3. The widening of difference\nbetween TC and TN is reflected in the metallic like resistivity behavior in between TC and\nTN . The applied magnetic field strongly reduces the resistivity in between TC . and TN .\nFig. 4 (a) shows the field dependence of the magnetoreistance MR = [\u03c1(H)-\u03c1(0)]/\u03c1(0) at\nselected temperatures. The data were taken after zero field cooling to a given temperature\n4\n\n\ffrom T = 300 K. At 215 K, the magnitude of MR increases rapidly for H <1 T and then\ngradually for higher fields. The data taken at 220 K, 225 K and 230 K (not shown here for\nclarity) are similar to the 215 K. The field dependence of these data are similar to the MR\nbehavior of the spin dependent tunnelling between the ferromagnetic grains in polycrystalline\nmanganites below the ferromagnetic Curie temperature10 . When T is decreased below 210\nK, MR gradually decreases with H initially and then rapidly around \u03bc0 H+\nC before levelling off\nat high fields. At 205 K, \u03bc0 H+\nC = 2.2 T during field increasing part which closely correlates\nwith \u03bc0 H+\nC found in the M(H) data in Fig. 1(c). In the A-type antiferromagnetic state,\nmetallic conduction is two dimensional in absence of magnetic field. When the interplanar\nantiferromagnetic coupling is destroyed by a strong magnetic field, the charge transport\nchanges into three dimensional in character which results in a rapid increase in the value of\nthe MR. The field induced antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic transition is first order with\na constant hysteresis width of 1.5 T. The maximum magnetoresistance at 7 T is -50-55 %\nwhich is comparable to other manganites.\nIs the MR due to changes in the spin sector alone ? To understand this aspect, we\nmeasured magnetostriction isotherms which are shown in Fig. 4(b). We find a giant volume\nexpansion with hysteresis in the temperature range 205 K-170 K. This behavior is opposite\nthe volume contraction under a magnetic field found in most of the manganites investigated\nearlier11 . The volume change is rather small when the sample is in the AF state but shows\na sudden jump during the field induced antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic transition. The\ncritical field \u03bc0 H+\nC = 2.25 T at 205 K is in close agreement with the MR and M(H) data.\nAfter the completion of the AF-FM transition \u2206V/V shows a gradual variation with further\nincrease in H.is gradual. At 210 K (i.e., T\u2248 TN ) \u2206V/V is small and it attains the maximum\nvalue of 0.25 % at 180 K and then decreases to 0.16 % at 170 K. This is because the maximum available field of 13.7 T is insufficient to complete the AF-FM transition. What is the\norigin of the observed volume expansion under the magnetic field ?. The A-type AF order is\ncoupled to the dx2 \u2212y2 orbital ordering. Orbital ordering creates quadrupole moments which\n5\n\n\fcan interact with the lattice through electron phonon coupling12 . The orbital ordering is\nalso destroyed together with the AF ordering for H >> \u03bc0 HC . This triggers a field induced\nstructural transition from the orthorhombic to possibly a tetragonal structure. This possibility is more likely given the fact the antiferromagnetic phase has lower volume than the\nparamagnetic phase as revealed by the volume thermal expansion data shown in Fig. 5.\nThe antiferromagnetic phase has orthorhombic structure and the paramagnetic phase has\ntetragonal structure9 . The volume thermal expansion decreases by \u2248 0.18 % in between\n220 K and 200 K.as the temperature is decreased and the structural transition shows hysteresis. If there were no magnetic and structural transition, \u2206V/V would have followed the\nGr\u0171neissan behavior shown as a fit to the high temperature data. The volume expansion\nunder the magnetic field has contributions one from volume change due to magnetic field\ninduced structural transition and another from volume change due to spontaneous magnetostriction of the field induced ferromagnetic phase. At 190 K the experimentally observed\nvolume is 0.21 % lower than the Gr\u0171neissan value whereas the volume magnetostriction is\n0.25 %. This small difference is due the contribution from spontaneous magnetostriction\nof the ferromagnetic phase.. Thus, our study indicates that the magnetotransport in the\nA-type AF Pr0.46 Sr0.54 MnO3 is strongly coupled to the structural transition under the field.\nIt will be interesting to know whether a large first order magnetoresistance behavior can be\never observed in a manganite without a change in lattice distortion or structural transition.\nIn conclusion, we have shown the A-type AF Pr0.46 Sr0.54 MnO3 exhibits a first order magnetoresistance behavior below the Neel temperature which involves not only spin and charge\nbut also the lattice. We found that the field induced antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic\ntransition is accompanied by a giant volume expansion which is suggested to the field induced structural transition from the low volume orthorhombic to the high volume tetragonal\nstructure. First order spin-charge-lattice coupled transition is also of great interest to study\ngiant magnetocaloric effect13 and future research on our compound need to be focussed on\nthis aspect.\n6\n\n\fAcknowledgments\nR.
