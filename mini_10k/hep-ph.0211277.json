It was discussed recently [2] that the\nrepresentations of three-point functions in terms of the light-cone variables may contain\nsingular terms of the form \u03b4(x), \u03b4(1 \u2212 x) and their derivatives, sometimes referred to as\nlongitudinal zero modes. Here x is the fraction of the external light-cone momentum p+\ncarried by the particle in the loop.\nIn this letter we show that end-point singularities may appear in Feynman integrals\ncorresponding to various types of diagrams (two-point functions, three-point functions, etc)\ncalculated using the light-cone variables. The origin of these singularities is related to the\nintegral over the big circle in the complex k\u2212 plane. We study which components of the\ntensor Feynman integrals may contain end-point singularities and propose a procedure for\ncalculating the invariant amplitudes which guarantees that end-point singularities do not\nappear explicitly in the integral representations in terms of the light-cone variables.\n\n2\n\nEnd-point singularities in the two-point function\n\nLet us start with the light-cone calculation of the Feynman integral corresponding to the\ntwo-point diagram:\n1\n\u03a3\u03bc (P ) =\n(2\u03c0)4 i\n\nZ\n\nd4 k\n\n(m2\n\n\u2212\n\nk2\n\nk\u03bc\n\u2212 i0) [m2 \u2212 (P \u2212 k)2 \u2212 i0]2\n\n= P\u03bc f (P 2 ) ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere we consider equal masses in the propagators for sake of simplicity.

Nonzero end-point contributions proportional to \u03b4(x), \u03b4(1\u2212x) and their derivatives\nmay emerge in specific components of the tensor \u03a3\u03bc1 \u03bc2 ...\u03bcm if at one of the end-points, x = 0\nor x = 1, the corresponding k\u2212 -integral diverges at least linearly. In particular, linear divergence of the k\u2212 integral at x = 0 leads to the appearance of the contact term \u03b4(x), whereas\na power divergence of order s leads to the term \u03b4 (s) (x). From the simple example considered\nabove we learn that:\n\u2022 End-point singularities \u03b4(x) and \u03b4(1\u2212x) in the fraction x of the longitudinal momentum\nnever appear in the components of the tensor \u03a3\u03bc1 \u03bc2 ...\u03bcm (P ) if all indices are different\nfrom (\u2212).\n\u2022 End-point singularities may emerge in the light-cone calculation of the Feynman integrals of the type \u03a3\u03bc1 \u03bc2 ...\u03bcm (P ) if some of the indices \u03bci are equal to (\u2212). These\nend-point singularities emerge as the residual contribution of the big-circle integration\nin the complex k\u2212 plane.\nOne remark is in order here. An alternative way to proceed is as follows. First we\nmodify the denominator of Eq. (1):\nh\n\nm2 \u2212 (P \u2212 k)2\n\ni2\n\nh\n\n\u2192 m2 \u2212 (P + q \u2212 k)2\n\ni h\n\ni\n\nm2 \u2212 (P \u2212 k)2 ,\n\n(13)\n\nwhere q = (q+ , 0, ~0\u22a5 ), and take the limit q+ \u2192 0 at the final stage of the calculation.\nIn this case one has three poles in the complex k\u2212 plane at different locations, and\nthe calculation looks similar to the triangle diagram for q+ 6= 0. In this case the\ncontribution of the big circle is zero, but the equivalent additional contribution to\n\u03a3\u03bc=(\u2212) re-appears as the nonvanishing residual contribution of the non-spectator pole\nin the limit q+ \u2192 0.\n\u2022 End-point contributions provide the covariance of the Feynman two-point integral on\nthe light cone, i.e. they guarantee the independence of the invariant amplitudes fi (P 2 )\nfrom the specific components used for their calculation.\n\u2022 There is an attractive possibility to avoid at all the explicit appearance of end-point\nsingularities in the invariant amplitudes. Namely, as one can check, the number of the\nindependent invariant amplitudes of any tensor \u03a3\u03bc1 \u03bc2 ...\u03bcm (P ) is precisely equal to the\nnumber of non-vanishing (+) and (\u22a5) components of \u03a3\u03bc1 \u03bc2 ...\u03bcm (P ).\nTherefore, it is possible to fully extract all the invariant amplitudes by considering\nonly those components which do not involve end-point singularities. We define such\ncomponents as the good componentsc .\nFor example, in case of \u03a3\u03bc (P ) there is only one form factor which can be determined\nfrom \u03a3+ (P ); in case of \u03a3\u03bc1 \u03bc2 (P ) the two form factors can be determined from \u03a3++ (P )\nand \u03a3\u22a5\u22a5 (P ), etc.\nc\n\nLet us point out that our definition of good components differs from the one adopted in Ref. [4].\n\n5\n\n\f3\n\nEnd-point singularities in the three-point function\n\nLet us now demonstrate that qualitatively the same results hold as well for Feynman integrals corresponding to three-point diagrams. Consider a convergent integral of the following\ngeneral form\n\u2032\n\n\u0393\u03bc1 ...\u03bcn (p, p |q) =\n\nZ\n\nd4 k\n\n(m2\n\n\u2212\n\nk2\n\n\u2212\n\ni0)nsp\n\n[m2\n\nk\u03bc1 . . . k\u03bcn\n(14)\n\u2212 (p \u2212 k)2 \u2212 i0]n1 [m2 \u2212 (p\u2032 \u2212 k)2 \u2212 i0]n2\n\nwhere the external momenta satisfy the relation p\u2032 = p + q. The tensor \u0393\u03bc1 ...\u03bcn (p, p\u2032 |q) can\nbe parameterized in terms of the Lorentz covariants constructed using the two independent\nvectors p and p\u2032 and in terms of Lorentz-invariant form factors depending on the three scalars\nq 2 , p2 , and p\u20322 as follows\n\u0393\u03bc1 ...\u03bcn (p, p\u2032 |q) =\n\nX\n\nLi\u03bc1 ...\u03bcn (p, p\u2032 ) f i (p2 , p\u20322 , q 2 ) .\n\n(15)\n\ni\n\nThe integral (14) converges if the powers nsp , n1 and n2 satisfy the relation\nn + 4 < 2 (nsp + n1 + n2 ) .\n\n(16)\n\nLet us consider the values of the invariants q 2 < 0 and p2 , p\u20322 < 4m2 . We introduce the\nlight-cone variables in the usual way and we use the reference frame in which the external\nmomenta have the following components\nq+ = 0,\n\n~p\u22a5 = 0 .\n\n(17)\n\nNow, the procedure of calculating the integral (14) just repeats the one used for the twopoint function (1). First, we introduce the light-cone variables for the vector k and translate\nthe Feynman imaginary parts in the propagators to the contour integral in the complex k\u2212\nplane while considering k+ and k\u22a5 to be real variables. Second, we modify the integration\ncontour in the complex k\u2212 plane to isolate the spectator pole. The only difference from the\ntwo-point case is that now there are three poles [5]: the spectator pole of order nsp lies on\none side of the integration contour, whereas the two poles related to the interacting particle\nlie on the other side, as shown in Fig. 2d . So the integration contour has precisely the same\nform as the one considered in Section 2. We again add and subtract the integral along the\nbig circle and obtain the final result of the k\u2212 integration in the form\nCircle\n\u0393\u03bc1 ...\u03bcn = \u0393Spect\n\u03bc1 ...\u03bcn + \u0393\u03bc1 ...\u03bcn .\n\n(18)\n\nAs in the two-point case, in the limit R \u2192 \u221e the integral over the big circle may diverge\nat the end-points x = 0 or x = 1 if some of the indices \u03bc1 . . . \u03bcn are equal to (\u2212). This\nsignals the appearance of the end-point singularities in the corresponding components of the\ntensor (14). It is also clear that no end-point singularities appear in the \u0393 components which\ncontain only good (+) and (\u22a5) indices.\nd\n\nClearly, the situation does not change if instead of one spectator pole (m2 \u2212 k 2 )nsp we have nsp single\npoles corresponding to different masses (\u03bc21 \u2212 k 2 )(\u03bc22 \u2212 k 2 ) . . . (\u03bc2nsp \u2212 k 2 ).\n\n6\n\n\f\u2212R\n\n\u2212R\n\nR\n\nCRSpect\n\nR\n\nCR\n\nFigure 2: Location of singularities in the complex k\u2212 plane for the three-point function (14).\n\nLet us check that all the k\u22a5 integrals for these good components are convergent. Potentially the most dangerous case is when all the indices are set \u03bci = (\u22a5). In this case the\nintegral in k\u22a5 for large k\u22a5 behaves like\nZ\n\n2\ndk\u22a5\n\nn\nk\u22a5\n\n(k\u22a5 )2(nsp +n1 +n2 )\n\n(19)\n\nwhich converges by virtue of Eq. (16). Therefore, both (+) and (\u22a5) components of the\nconvergent triangle Feynman diagram do not contain any end-point singularities and they\ncan be represented as convergent integrals in x and k\u22a5 .\nNote that the number of the components of \u0393\u03bc1 ...\u03bcn containing only (+) and (\u22a5) indices\nis equal to the number of the independent form factors. Let us illustrate this statement for\nsmall values of n:\n\u2022 n = 1. There are 2 form factors which can be determined from the (+) and (\u22a51 ) components. Hereafter we distinguish between the two components in the transverse plane\nand denote by \u22a51 and \u22a52 the components along and perpendicular to ~q\u22a5 , respectively.\nNote that integrals containing an odd number of \u22a52 indices are zero.\n\u2022 n = 2. For a symmetric tensor \u0393\u03bc1 \u03bc2 there are 4 form factors, which can be found from\nthe (+ +), (+ \u22a51 ) and the two independent (\u22a51 \u22a51 ) and (\u22a52 \u22a52 ) components.\n\u2022 n = 3. Symmetric tensor \u0393\u03bc1 \u03bc2 \u03bc3 contains 6 independent Lorentz structures, and the\ncorresponding six good components are (+ + +), (+ + \u22a51 ), (+ \u22a51 \u22a51 ), (+ \u22a52 \u22a52 ),\n(\u22a51 \u22a51 \u22a51 ), (\u22a51 \u22a52 \u22a52 ).\nThus, we can always extract all the form factors from the good components of the Feynman tensor (14) fully avoiding end-point contributions. The latter may appear in the integral\nrepresentations of the form factors calculated from the (\u2212) components of the three-point\nfunction (14). The explicit form of the integral representations depend on which set of\ncomponents of the tensor \u0393\u03bc1 ...\u03bcn is used, but of course the form factors f i are relativistic\ninvariants, so taht their values do not depend on the specific set of components considered.\n7\n\n\fWe have shown that end-point singularities never appear in the good (+) and (\u22a5) components of \u0393\u03bc1 ...\u03bcn , while they may appear in those components which carry the (\u2212) indices.\nWe can easily find under which conditions end-point singularities do not appear in any of\nthe components of the tensor \u0393\u03bc1 ...\u03bcn . The worst situation in the integral (14) occurs if all\nthe indices \u03bci are equal to (\u2212). The corresponding form of the k\u2212 integral is\nZ\n\ndk\u2212\n\nn\nk\u2212\n.\n[xk\u2212 ]nsp [(1 \u2212 x)k\u2212 ]n1 +n2\n\n(20)\n\nIf\nn + 1 \u2264 nsp\n\nand\n\nn + 1 \u2264 n1 + n2 ,\n\n(21)\n\nthen for both x \u2192 0 and x \u2192 1 the integral over the big circle remains convergent and no\nend-point contributions appear at all.\nBefore closing this section we point out that in Ref. [2] end-point singularities were\nobtained by means of a different procedure. The Feynman integral (14) was calculated for\nq+ 6= 0 and the form factors were reconstructed from the (\u2212) components of the tensor.\nIn this case the contribution of the big circle vanishes, but in the limit q+ \u2192 0 additional\ncontributions to the form factors were found from the non-spectator poles. The longitudinal\nzero modes obtained in this way were interpreted as a contribution of the pair creation\nprocess, prompting that the one-body current approximation is inconsistent. We do not\nagree with such an interpretation: end-point singularities are not intrinsically related to the\npair creation process, because they emerge directly at q+ = 0.\n\n4\n\nConclusions\n\nLet us summarize our main results:\n1. End-point singularities \u03b4(x), \u03b4(1 \u2212 x) and their derivatives may appear in the calculations of ultra-violet convergent Feynman integrals using light-cone variables as a\nremnant contribution of the big-circle integration in the k\u2212 -plane. End-point singularities may appear in the components which have some of the indices equal to (\u2212), but\nthey never appear when all the indices are equal to (+) or (\u22a5). Therefore we define\nthe latter components as the 'good' components.\n2. One can avoid the explicit appearance of end-point contributions in the integral representations of the invariant amplitudes in terms of light-cone variables. To this end\none should use only the good (+) and (\u22a5) components of the Lorentz tensors for extracting the invariant amplitudes. This is always possible since the number of the good\ncomponents is equal to the number of the invariant amplitudes. We have followed this\nstrategy in Ref. [6] for the description of the electromagnetic form factors for spin-0,\nspin-1/2 and spin-1 bound states.\n8\n\n\fOne can of course consider (\u2212) components and include the contributions of end-point\nsingularities; then one recovers the same form factors as those obtained from (+) and\n(\u22a5) components.\n3. End-point singularities are not related to any physical process. In particular, the zeromode contribution to the (\u2212) component of the electromagnetic current operator is not\nrelated to the pair creation process, although mathematically the regularizing procedure\nq+ \u2192 0 is one of the ways to obtain the zero-mode contribution.\n4. End-point singularities do not appear in any components of the Feynman integrals if\nthe integrals contain propagators with sufficiently high powers [see Eqs. (14) and (21)].\n\nAcknowledgments\nOne of us, D. M., thanks the Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung and the Istituto Nazionale\ndi Fisica Nucleare for financial support.\n\nReferences\n[1] S.-J.
