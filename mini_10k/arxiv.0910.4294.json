Methods: data analysis \u2013 Methods: statistical \u2013 Cosmology: cosmic microwave background\n\n1. Introduction\n\nsolution of type\n\nA widely used approach for the separation of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) from the diffuse Galactic background is the internal linear combination method (ILC).\nFor instance, this method was adopted in the reduction of\nthe data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe\n(WMAP) satellite for CMB observations (Bennett et al.\n2003). Its success is due to the fact that, among the separation techniques, ILC calls for the smallest number of a\npriori assumptions. If the data are in the form of No maps,\ntaken at different frequencies and containing Np pixels each,\nthe model on which ILC is based is\n(i)\n\nS (i) (p) = Sc (p) + Sf (p) + N (i) (p).\n\n(1)\n\nHere, S (i) (p) provides the value of the pth pixel for a map\n(i)\nobtained at channel \" i \" 1 , whereas Sc (p), Sf (p) and\n(i)\nN (p) are the contributions due to the CMB, the diffuse Galactic foreground and the experimental noise, respectively. Although not necessary, often it is assumed that\nall of these contributions are representable by means of stationary random fields. Moreover, without loss of generality,\nfor ease of notation the random fields are supposed as the\nrealization of zero-mean spatial processes. The basic idea\nbehind model (1) is that, contrary to the components that\nform the Galactic background, CMB is independent of the\nobserving channel. ILC exploits this fact averaging No imo\nages {S (i) (p)}N\ni=1 and giving a specific weight wi to each\nof them so as to minimize the impact of the foreground\nand noise (Bennett et al. 2003). This means to look for a\n1\n\nIn the present work, p indexes pixels in the classic spatial\ndomain. However, the same formalism applies if other domains\nare considered, for example, the Fourier one.\n\nIf the constraint\n\nb c (p) =\nS\n\nPNo\n\ni=1\n\nNo\nX\n\nwi S (i) (p).\n\n(2)\n\ni=1\n\nwi = 1 is imposed, Eq. (2) becomes\n\nb c (p) = Sc (p) +\nS\n\nNo\nX\n\n(i)\n\nwi [Sf (p) + N (i) (p)].\n\n(3)\n\ni=1\n\nNow, from this equation it is clear that, for a given pixel\n\"p\", the only variable terms are in the sum. Hence, under\n(i)\nthe assumption of independence of Sc (p) from Sf (p) and\nN (i) (p), the weights {wi } have to minimize the variance of\nb c (p), i.e.\nS\n{wi } = arg min\n{wi }\n\nVAR [Sc (p)] + VAR\n\n\"N\no\nX\n\n(i)\nwi (Sf (p)\n\ni=1\n\n+N\n\n(i)\n\n#\n\n(p)) ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere VAR[s(p)] is the expected variance of s(p).\nIf S (i) denotes a row vector such as S (i) =\n[S (i) (1), S (i) (2), . . . , S (i) (Np )] and the No \u00d7 Np matrix S\nis defined as\n\uf8eb (1) \uf8f6\nS\n\uf8ec S (2) \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n(5)\nS = \uf8ec . \uf8f7,\n\uf8ed .. \uf8f8\nS (No )\nthen Eq. (1) becomes\n\nS = Sc + S f + N .\n\n(6)\n\n\f2\n\nR. Vio, & P. Andreani: ILC method\n\nIn this case, the weights are given by (Eriksen et al. 2004)\nw=\n\nC \u22121\nS 1\n,\nT \u22121\n1 CS 1\n\n(7)\n\nwhere C S is the No \u00d7 No cross-covariance matrix of the\nrandom processes that generate S, i.e.\nC S = E[SS T ],\n\n(8)\n\nand 1 = (1, 1, . . . , 1)T is a column vector of all ones. Here,\nE[.] denotes the expectation operator. Hence, the ILC estimator takes the form\nb c = wT S,\nS\n= \u03b11\n\nT\n\nC \u22121\nS S,\n\n(9)\n(10)\n\nwith 1T w = 1 and the scalar quantity \u03b1 given by\n\u22121\n\u03b1 = [1T C \u22121\n.\nS 1]\n\n(11)\n\nIn practical applications, matrix C S is unknown and\nhas to be estimated from the data. Typically, this is done\nby means of the estimator\nb S = 1 SS T .\nC\nNp\n\n(12)\n\nIn this case, the ILC estimator is given by Eqs.(9)-(11) with\nb S and\nC S and w replaced, respectively, by C\nb \u22121\nC\nS 1\nb =\n.\nw\nT b \u22121\n1 CS 1\n\nThe reason is that S f is a fixed realization of a random\nprocess. There is no way to obtain another one. Even if\nobserved many times (under the same experimental conditions) the foreground components (for instance the Galaxy)\nwill always appear the same. Only the noise component N\nwill change. Indeed, apart from very specific situations, in\ngeneral ILC has to be expected to provide biased estimates\nof CMB (Vio & Andreani 2008). Here, we stress that the\nbiased results provided by ILC is a well established fact\nonly relatively to the estimation of the power-spectrum of\nCMB (e.g. Saha et. al 2008).\nA second issue, often neglected in literature, is the belief that, in order to work, ILC does not require any hypothesis about S f . Again, this is not correct. As proved by\nVio & Andreani (2008), even in the case of noise-free data,\none may hope to obtain an unbiased estimate of the CMB\nonly if S f is given by a linear mixture of the contribution\nc\nof Nc physical processes {Sj }N\nj=1 , i.e.\n\n(13)\n\n(i)\n\nSf =\n\nb c |Sc ] = Sc + wT E[S f ] + wT E[N ] = Sc ,\nE[S\n\n(14)\n\nb c |Sc , S f ] = Sc + w T S f + wT E[N ] = Sc .\nE[S\n\n(15)\n\ni.e. the ILC estimator is unbiased 2 . This is not correct: the\nb c is unbiased requires to prove that\nclaim that S\n\naij Sj ,\n\n(16)\n\nj=1\n\nwith aij constant coefficients and Nc < No . This means\nthat for the jth physical process a template Sj is assumed\nto exists which is independent of the specific channel \" i \".\nMoreover, the number of these channels has to be greater\nthan that of the physical processes. Inserting Eq. (16) into\nEq. (6) one obtains\nS = AS + N\nwith\n\n\uf8eb\n\nSc\n\uf8ec S1\n\uf8ecS\n2\nS=\uf8ec\n\uf8ec.\n\uf8ed ..\nSN c\n\n2. Some unfocussed points about ILC\nIn spite of its popularity, various questions concerning ILC\nappear not yet well fixed. A first issue is linked to the\nfact that the estimation of the power-spectrum of CMB\nis a problem deeply different from the separation of this\ncomponent from the Galactic foreground. Indeed, the estimation of the second-order properties of a stochastic signal, though contaminated by noise, is an easier task than\nits recovery. Here, the point is that, if one is interested\nin the spatial distribution of the CMB emission, then in\n(i)\nEq. (1) the term Sf (p) + N (i) (p) cannot be considered\nas a single noise component. Often such assumption is\nmade (e.g., see Eriksen et al. 2004; Hinshaw et al. 2007;\nDelabrouille et al. 2009; Dick et al. 2009) since in this way\nthe problem is reduced to the separation of two components\nonly and no a priori information on the \"global\" noise is\nrequired. Actually, this procedure can lead to wrong conclusions. For example, since all of the component in the\nmixtures S are supposed to be the realization of a zeromean random processes, from Eq. (3) one could derive that\n\nNc\nX\n\nand\n\n\uf8eb\n\n1\n\uf8ec1\nA=\uf8ec\n\uf8ed ..\n.\n1\n\na11\na21\n..\n.\naN o 1\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7,\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n\uf8f6\na12 . . . a1Nc\na22 . . . a2Nc \uf8f7\n.. . .\n.. \uf8f7\n\uf8f8.\n.\n.\n.\naN o 2 . . . aN o N c\n\n(17)\n\n(18)\n\n(19)\n\nThis is the only model that ILC is able to handle 3 . This fact\nshould suggest extreme caution when dealing with questions as the nonGaussianity of CMB. Indeed, the results\nproduced by ILC are extremely sensitive to the presence of\ncomponents that are not modelizable by means of Eqs. (17)(19). By instance, without renouncing the cosmic origin of\nCMB, this could explain the spatial associations claimed\nby Verschuur (2007) between the interstellar neutral hydrogen (HI) emission morphology and small-scale structure\nobserved by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe\n(WMAP).\nA third issue is that, using the weights w, it is implicitly assumed that C S is a well conditioned matrix.\nHowever, there are various practical situations where this\ncondition is not satisfied. By instance, this can be expected\nfor high signal-to-noise ratio observations at high Galactic\nlatitude, i.e. when noise N is negligible and CMB is by far\n\n2\nHere, E[a|b] = [E[a(1)|b(1)], E[a(2)|b(2)], . . . , E[a(Np )|b(Np )]]T 3 If data are contaminated by noise, i.e. N 6= 0, then in Eq. (7)\nwith E[a(p)|b(p)] the conditional expectation of a(p) given b(p). C S has to be substituted with C S \u2212 C N .\n\n\fR. Vio, & P. Andreani: ILC method\n\nthe dominant component with aij \u226a 1, i = 1, 2, . . . , No ,\nj = 1, 2, . . . , Nc . Indeed, since\nC S = AC S AT ,\n\n(20)\n\nwhen A is badly conditioned it has to be expected that the\nsame holds for C S . As a consequence, an imprecise calibration of the No maps, in such a way that the true value\nof the entries in the first column of A are different from\n\"1\", will be amplified with catastrophic consequences. This\nis what lead Dick et al. (2009) to the conclusion that, in\nthe case of high signal-to-noise ratio observations, ILC is extremely sensitive to calibration errors. If true, this should be\na quite troublesome situation since it limits the usefulness\nof the observations in a high signal-to-noise ratio regime.\nActually, this problem can be easily avoided if in Eq. (7)\n\u22121\nCS\nis substituted with the corresponding Moore-Penrose\nb\ninverse C \u2020S . These arguments hold also when the weights w\n\u2020\n\u22121\nb substitutes C\nb in Eq. (13). This is clearly\nare used and C\nS\nS\nvisible in Figs. 1 and 2 that show the results provided by\nILC in the case of a simulated high Galactic latitude observation at three different frequencies, say 30, 44, and 70\nGHz. The region analyzed is a square patch (400 \u00d7 400 pixels) with side of about 24\u25e6 , centered at l = 90\u25e6 , b = 45\u25e6\n(Galactic coordinates). Three components have been considered, i.e. CMB, synchrotron and dust. More details can\nbe found in Vio et al. (2003). The effects of the different\npoint spread function for the various frequencies have been\nneglected. The top panels of Fig. 1 shows the templates relative to the phsyical processes that have been used to form\nthe three linear mixtures shown in the bottom panel of the\nsame figure. No noise has been added. Perfect frequency\nscaling has been assumed, i.e. model (17)-(19) holds, but\na calibration error of 10% has been imposed in all of the\nchannels. The assumption of perfect frequency scaling constitutes only an approximation. However, since CMB by far\nconstitutes the dominant component, this is of secondary\nimportance. In fact, the condition number of the resulting\nb S is 1.6 \u00d7 106 , i.e. this matrix is ill-conditioned. The reC\nsults obtainable by ILC using the original weights (13) and\nb \u2020 are shown in Fig.2. It is\ntheir version computed using C\nS\nevident that, if not properly addressed, the ill-conditioning\nb S has catastrophic consequences on the quality of the\nof C\nseparation.\n\n3. Conclusions\nFrom the analysis presented above, it is evident that the\nresults provided by ILC have to be interpreted with extreme\ncaution. This techniques suffers many drawbacks that, if\nnot properly taken into account, can lead to misleading if\nnot wrong conclusions. In particular, ILC should be used\nb S is (close to be) singular,\nonly in situations where matrix C\ni.e. only when one can be certain that model (17)-(19) holds\nwith No > Nc + 1.
