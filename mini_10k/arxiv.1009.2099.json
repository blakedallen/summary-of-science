A dark matter halo density profile is developed based only on the\nscale free nature of clustering that leads to a statistically self-similar distribution of the substructures\nat galactic scale.

INTRODUCTION\n\nObservational and theoretical studies of galaxy rotation curves (Rubin & Ford 1970), velocity dispersions\nof elliptical galaxies (Faber & Jackson 1976), baryon\nfraction in clusters (Clowe et al. 2006; Massey et al.\n2007), gravitational lensing, structure formation, CMB\npower spectrum etc. indicate that a significant fraction of the mass of the Universe has no electromagnetic interaction (Bertone et al. 2005). At galactic scale,\nthe main evidence for the existence of such gravitating matter with very high mass to light ratio comes\nfrom observations of galaxy rotation curves.\nThe\ngravitational potential derived from the observed rotation curve can not be explained only by the visible mass with any reasonable mass to light ratio\n(Rubin & Ford 1970, 1980; Sofue 1996; Sofue & Rubin\n2001; Spano et al. 2008). Though there are modified theories of the gravitation and other suggestions (Milgrom\n1983; Bekenstein & Milgrom 1984; Sanders 1986; Fahr\n1990; Sanders 1997; Brownstein & Moffat 2006) to explain this anomaly, the dark matter concept is widely\naccepted to be a simpler explanation of these observations. Though observations of galaxy rotation curves established the existence of the dark matter at galactic\nscale, there is no general agreement on the nature and\nvarious properties (like mass distribution) of this major\nconstituent of the Universe (Navarro et al. 1996; de Blok\n2005). Potentially, galaxy rotation curves can also shed\nlight on some aspects of the dark matter properties and\nthus help us in deriving a better understanding of the\nnature of the dark matter. One such key aspect is the\ndensity profile or the mass distribution of the dark matter at galactic scale.\nOn the theoretical front, there are various mass distribution models of the dark matter halo. The isothermal profile, the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile and\nsome variant of these two profiles are used extensively in\nboth theoretical and observational studies. An almost\nflat observed rotation curve outside the core of a galaxy\nled to the dark matter halo model with 1/r2 isothermal density profile (Begeman et al. 1991; Burkert 1995).\nnroy@aoc.nrao.edu\n\nThe density at the centre is not finite in this model.\nHowever, it is possible to impose appropriate boundary\nconditions to derive a non-singular solution with density \u03c1(r)N IS = \u03c10 rc2 /(rc2 + r2 ), where \u03c10 is the central\ndensity and rc is the \"core radius\". At large radius,\nthis profile will be similar to 1/r2 singular isothermal\nprofile. A cut-off radius rmax is also required to be imposed to keep the total mass of the halo finite. However, the non-singular isothermal profile was not very\nsuccessful in explaining the observed rotation curves. A\nsignificant progress in the field was the introduction of\nan alternative density profile, the NFW density profile,\n\u03c1(r)N F W = \u03c10 rc3 /[r(rc + r)2 ], where \u03c1c and rc are the\ncharacteristic density and characteristic radius respectively (Navarro et al. 1996, 1997; Jing 2000).\nThe NFW profile has been quite successful in explaining the observed rotation curves for many galaxies. Over\nthe time, a class of variant of the isothermal and the\nNFW profiles are also introduced to fine tune the agreement of theory and observations (Burkert 1995; Zhao\n1996; Fukushige & Makino 2001). All these density profiles are of more or less similar merit, as far as explaining\nthe rotation curve is concerned. However, detailed analysis shows that the NFW profile has a number of problems. For example, observations of galaxies and clusters suggest a central flat density core (de Blok 2007;\nKuzio de Naray et al. 2008), whereas, in NFW profile,\ndark matter density has a central cusp with a logarithmic slope \u2248 \u22121. Numerical simulations show that the\npresence of baryon can change the mass distribution significantly (El-Zant et al. 2004; Shlosman 2010, and references therein), and for isothermal cusp, minor merger\nand dynamical friction may lead to a shallower central\ndensity slope (Romano-D\u0131\u0301az et al. 2008). The NFW profile also seems not to fit the observed rotation curves of\nthe dark matter dominated low surface brightness galaxies and low mass dwarf galaxies (de Blok 2002, 2005).\nA more serious issue with the NFW profile is that the\nprofile is derived by fitting analytical function to the\ndensity distribution derived from numerical simulation\nof structure formation with dark matter. This, in a\nsense, lacks a proper physical understanding. Though\nsome physical insight of the NFW profile have recently\n\n\f2\ncome from further high resolution dark matter simulations (e.g., Taylor & Navarro 2001), the issue is far from\nbeing settled. Moreover, even if these cosmological simulations are very successful on large scale, at galactic\nscale there are unsolved issues, like the \"angular momentum problem\" (Sommer-Larsen, Gelato & Vedel 1999;\nSommer-Larsen & Dolgov 2001; Burkert & D'Onghia\n2004) or the \"missing satellite problem\" (Klypin et al.\n1999; Moore et al. 1999), which are yet to be addressed.\nHere, we have developed a self-consistent model of the\ndark matter halo substructure distribution at galactic\nscale to explain observed NFW-like rotation curves. Support for the existence of dark matter substructures has\nmainly come from numerical simulations (Giocoli et al.\n2008; Madau et al. 2008; Springel et al. 2008; Elahi et al.\n2009a; Ludlow et al. 2009). But, there are strong observational hints like flux anomalies and time delays in gravitational lensing (Chen 2009; Keeton & Moustakas 2009;\nVegetti & Koopmans 2009; Xu et al. 2009), or enhanced\ngamma rays and leptonic cosmic rays (Elahi et al. 2009b;\nPinzke et al. 2009), indicating the presence of substructures. The present model is based on the assumption\nof a scale free nature of the dark matter clustering that\nleads to a statistically self-similar distribution of the halo\nsubstructures at galactic scale. It is shown that a simple fractal model of the dark matter halo substructure\npredicts an NFW-like rotation curve. Such a model also\npredicts a scale free power spectrum of the rotation velocity fluctuations. The model is described in Section 2,\nand the results are presented in Section 3. Possible limitations of our analysis are discussed in Section 4. Finally,\nwe summarize and present our conclusions in Section 5.\n2. THE MODEL\n\n2.1. Assumptions, Parameters and Constraints\nAssuming that the dark matter clustering has a scale\nfree nature (i.e., there exist halo substructures of a wide\nrange of mass), the density profile can be described as\na combination of a smooth radial profile \u03c1(r/rc ) and a\nstochastic part \u03b4\u03c1. Here rc is a characteristic \"core\"\nradius and \u03c1 contains information of the density variation at scales larger than or comparable to rc . For the\npurpose of this work, we have used a simpler model of\nthis density distribution which, however, retains all relevant key features. In this simplified model, we have\nassumed that each dark matter clump has a number of\nsmaller clumps around it. Each of these smaller clumps\nare in turn just a scaled down version with even smaller\nclumps around them. As a result, the whole structure\nhas an approximate spherical symmetry and a statistical\nself-similarity. It is assumed here that all these clumps\nhave non-singular isothermal density profile where the\ncentral density (\u03c10 ), the core radius (rc ), the cut-off radius (rmax ) and the halo to subhalo distance (D) are\nscaled down accordingly. However, this specific density\nprofile is not a crucial assumption in our model and the\nindividual substructures may have any non-singular density profile \u03c1(r/rc ), where rc is some characteristic radius. Essentially, this is a fractal structure with three\nparameters: (i) n, the number of small clumps around\nany clump, (ii) fr , spatial scaling factor for core radius,\ncut-off radius and distance and (iii) f\u03c1 , central density\nscaling factor between any clump and its next smallest\n\nclumps. A fractal is a fragmented and irregular geometrical shape with exact or stochastic self-similar structures\nat all scales (Mandelbrot 1983). Independent of the value\nof fr and n, the (Hausdorff) fractal dimension of such a\nstructure is 3 for nfr3 < 1. However, since at each iteration, the linear size of clumps scales by a factor fr and\nthe mass scales by a factor n, the local mass dimension\nfor any substructure level is Dm = \u2212log(n)/log(fr ) over\na certain range of scales. A mass dimension of Dm for\na medium implies that the mass enclosed in a sphere of\nradius r in such a medium will be M (r) = krDm . So,\nfor the N th substructure level, MN (r) = kN rDm over a\nrange of scales depending on N , n, fr , D and rmax . Note\nthat this range is different for different substructure levels. Hence, for the complete structure, the total mass\nM (r), which is the sum of MN (r) of all the substructure\nlevels, will not have a simple power law radial dependence. But, the dark matter halo mass function will still\nbe a power law, N (m) \u221d m\u2212\u03b1 , where the power law\nindex \u03b1 = \u2212log(n)/log(fr3f\u03c1 ) is a more physically motivated parameter of this model and can be constrained\nfrom theoretical and numerical analysis of dark matter\nstructure formation (Gao et al. 2004; Zemp et al. 2009).\nThe density distribution can be written as\n\u221e X\nn\nX\ni\n\n\u03c1(r) = \u03c1bg +\n\n\u03c1s (\u03c10,i , rc,i , rmax,i , ~ri,j )\n\n(1)\n\ni=0 j=1\n\nwhere\n\u03c1bg\nis\nbackground\ndensity\nand\n\u03c1s (\u03c10,i , rc,i , rmax,i , ~ri,j ) is density profile of individual substructure centred at ~ri,j with central density\n(\u03c10,i ), core radius (rc,i ) and cut-off radius (rmax,i ).\nConsidering the self-similarity of this model,\n\u03c10,i = f\u03c1 \u00d7 \u03c10,i\u22121\nrc,i = fr \u00d7 rc,i\u22121\nrmax,i = fr \u00d7 rmax,i\n~\n~ri,j = ~ri\u22121,k + (fr \u00d7 Di\u22121 \u00d7 d)\n\n(2)\n\nwhere k = ni\u22121 , d~ is a unit length vector with\nrandom orientation and the initial set of parameters\n\u03c10,0 , rc,0 , rmax,0 = \u03c10 , rc , rmax is for the largest subhalo\ncentered at the origin. In principle, \u03c1bg may be a smooth\nfunction of r. But, since we are assuming it to be a small\nbackground density threshold, its effect on the final rotation curve is not very significant. So, for simplicity, we\nhave assumed \u03c1bg to be constant over the radius of our\ninterest. This structure is shown schematically (without\nany randomness for the shake of clarity) in the left panel\nof Figure 1. After introducing randomness in angular\nposition of the subhalos, one realization of such a structure with n = 7 and fr = 0.33 is shown with two and\nfour substructure levels in the middle and right panel respectively. This model can be considered as a simplified\nrepresentation of the scale free, clumpy density structure\nof dark matter above a small threshold density at the\ngalactic scale.\nWe note that the parameters for this model are constrained to a good extent by various physical considerations. Assuming that the structure is extended down\nto the infinitely small scale, to avoid a divergence of\nthe total mass, the quantity nfr3 f\u03c1 must be less than\nunity. Similarly, for a halo with cut-off radius rmax , halo\n\n\f3\n\nR\n\nma\nx\n\nfr \u00d7\n\nD\n\nD\n\nfr \u00d7\nrm\n\nrm\n\nax\n\nax\n\nn=3\nfr = 0.4\n\nFigure 1. Left: Schematic representation of the halo substructure with three subhalos around any big halo. Note that both the cut-off\nradius (rmax ) and the halo to subhalo distance (D) are scaled down by a factor fr for each substructure level. Middle and Right Halo\nsubstructure with seven subhalos around any big halo and with fr = 0.33. The middle and right panels show the structure with two and\nfour substructure levels respectively.\n\nto subhalo distance D must be greater than or equal\nto (1 \u2212 fr )rmax /(1 \u2212 2fr ) to avoid any overlap. Also\nnote that the density of any subhalo at the cutoff radius\n\u03c1(rmax ) scales as f\u03c1 . So, we adopt f\u03c1 = 1.0 for further\nanalysis to ensure a constant density at the cutoff radius\nfor all the substructures. In this simplified model, we\nhave assumed that all the parameters like D, \u03c10 , rmax\netc. are identical for all the subhalos for a particular substructure level and n, fr and f\u03c1 remain constant for all\nthe levels. In a realistic situation, however, all these parameters may have some random variation. As a result\nof these fluctuations, the halo mass function, the radial\nmass distribution, and in turn, the rotation curves, are\nexpected to be somewhat smoother than that are predicted from this analysis.\n2.2. Tidal stability\nA much stronger constraint on the parameters comes\nfrom the consideration of the stability of this structures\npreventing tidal disruption by invoking self-gravity. Considering a rigid object of mass m and radius r at a distance d from a bigger object of mass M and radius R,\nfrom the standard Roche limit consideration, D should\nbe \u223c r(2M/m)1/3 to avoid tidal disruption of the smaller\nbody. In the case of any halo and its immediate subhalo,\nm/M = fr3 and r/R = fr imply d \u2248 1.25R. For even\nsmaller subhalo structures with r/R = frk , the mass is\nscaled accordingly m/M = fr3k and d \u2248 1.25R assures\nstability. Hence, a distance\n1 \u2212 fr\nrmax\n(3)\nD \u2265 1.25x\n1 \u2212 2fr\nwill make the whole structure stable. Here x is a fudge\nfactor and we use the value of x = 1.1 to accommodate\nnon-rigid density clumps. For a given value of D, the\nnumber of substructure n is also constrained to be\n4(1 \u2212 fr )2\n4\u03c0D2\n=\n(4)\nn\u2264\n\u03c0(fr D/1 \u2212 fr )2\nfr2\nto avoid any possible overlap of subhalo structures.\n2.3. Virial stability\n\nA detailed virial stability analysis requires numerical\nsimulation of the dynamics of such a density distribution\nto get the time-averaged dynamical quantities. But, a\nsimple ensemble average virial scaling analysis may be\nused to constrain the central density \u03c10 for a set of model\nparameter. As the whole structure is assumed to have\nan approximate spherical symmetry, average kinetic and\npotential energies, hT i and hV i, for thin spherical shells\nof radius r and thickness \u03b4r will be\n1\n1\n2\n2\nhT i = m\u03c3DM\n= 4\u03c0r2 \u03b4r\u03c1(r)\u03c3DM\n2\n2\nGM (r)m\n= \u2212vc2 (r)4\u03c0r2 \u03b4r\u03c1(r)\n(5)\nhV i = \u2212\nr\nwhere \u03c3DM is dark matter velocity dispersion, M (r) is\ntotal mass within radius r and vc (r) = (GM/r)1/2 is the\nscale dependent virial velocity equivalent of the \"circular\nvelocity\" for rotating disk. Since the rotation curve has\na roughly constant value v0 at large radius, the ratio\n2hT i/|hV i| will tend to the equilibrium value of 1 at large\nradius if \u03c3DM \u2248 v0 . Using the minimum value for D from\nequation (3), the maximum extent of the structure Rmax\nwill be D/(1 \u2212 fr ) and the average density will be\nh\u03c1i =\n\n3(1 \u2212 2fr )3 (s \u2212 tan\u22121 s)\n\u03c1c\n(1.25xs)3 (1 \u2212 nfr3 )\n\n(6)\n\nwhere s = rmax /rc . Note, however, that this is a fractal structure with significant porosity. So, the average\ndensity of any individual clump is higher than h\u03c1i by a\nfactor of (1 \u2212 nfr3 )(Rmax /rmax )3 . Now, for global stability of the whole structure, Rmax should be less than or\nequal to the radius within which the virial equilibrium\nis maintained. Average density within this virial radius\nrvir or r200 should be \u2248 200 times more than the critical\ndensity \u03c1crit = 3H 2 /8\u03c0G. For a choice of model parameters n, fr , s and x, this will constrain the lower limit of\nthe central density \u03c10 so that h\u03c1i & 200\u03c1crit . For individual substructures, both mass and volume scale as fr3 ,\nkeeping the average density constant. This implies that\nstability for one substructure level ensures stability for\nall other levels.\n\n\f4\nFractal Model\nNFW fit\nNIS (with cut-off)\nNIS (without cut-off)\nNFW (without cut-off)\n\n1.6\n\n\u03c1bg = 0.00\n\u03c1bg = 0.03 \u00d7 \u03c1(rmax)\n\u03c1bg = 0.10 \u00d7 \u03c1(rmax)\n\u03c1bg = 0.30 \u00d7 \u03c1(rmax)\n\n1.2\n\n1.2\n\nvc/v0\n\nvc/v0\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\nFractal Model parameters:\nn = 35, fr = 0.25, f\u03c1 = 1.0, rmax = 6.0rc, D=2.06rmax\n\nFractal Model parameters:\nn = 35, fr = 0.25, f\u03c1 = 1.0, rmax = 6.0rc, D=2.06rmax\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\nr/rc\n\nFigure 2.

Rotation curve\nSince the halo density distribution is significantly\nclumpy, the velocity field for such a system is also expected to have fluctuations at all scales. However, due to\napproximate spherical symmetry of the clump distribution, the average rotation velocity over a spherical shell\nat radius r will still be hvc (r)i \u2248 (GMr /r)1/2 , where Mr\nis the total mass within this radius. As pointed out in\nsubsection 2.3 using the virial stability argument, the\nvirial velocity or, equivalently, the \"rotation\" velocity is\nexpected to be approximately same as the local velocity\ndispersion. This derived rotation curve for the fractal\nmodel is found to be NFW-like at large radial distance.\nAt small radius, by construction, the rotation curve is obviously exactly same as that of a non-singular isothermal\nhalo. This is shown in Figure 2. Radial distance is scaled\nby rc and rotation velocity is scaled by v0 , which is the\nrotation velocity at the maximum radius plotted. The\nblack curve is the predicted rotation curve for the fractal\nsubstructure model with n = 35, fr = 0.25, f\u03c1 = 1.0\nand rmax = 6.0rc and the red line is the best fit NFW\nprofile to that. The background density threshold \u03c1bg is\nassumed to be negligible in this model. Rotation curves\nfor non-singular isothermal sphere with and without a\ncutoff (green and blue curves respectively) as well as for\nNFW halo (magenta curve) are also shown in Figure 2\nfor a comparison. The velocity scaling ensures that the\ntotal mass encompassed by the maximum radius is same\nfor all models.\nThe effect of the background density threshold \u03c1bg is\nshown in Figure 3. Here, the rotation curve is evaluated\nfor different \u03c1bg keeping all other parameters same as in\nFigure 2. For scaling, we have used the density \u03c1(rmax )\nat the cutoff radius rmax = 6.0rc . Different curves in\nFigure 3 are for \u03c1bg /\u03c1(rmax ) = 0.00, 0.03, 0.10 and 0.30\n(black, red, green and blue curve respectively). The gen-\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\nr/rc\n\nFigure 3. Predicted rotation curve for the fractal substructure\nmodel for different background density threshold \u03c1bg . All other\nparameters are same as in Figure 2. Different curves are for\n\u03c1bg /\u03c1(rmax ) = 0.00, 0.03, 0.10 and 0.30 (black, red, green and\nblue curve respectively).\n\neral NFW-like nature of the rotation curve and the radial\nfluctuations remain unchanged. But depending on the\nvalue of \u03c1bg , rotation curve at large radius may be rising,\nflat or declining. Note that the derived rotation curves\nshown in Figure 3 are with the simple model of a constant \u03c1bg . In reality, \u03c1bg is expected to be decreasing with\nincreasing r, giving rise to a rotation curve somewhat intermediate between the extremes shown in Figure 3.\n3.2. Velocity fluctuations\nThe predicted rotation curve due to the clustering of\ndark matter subhalos is very similar to the observed rotation curve and the empirical NFW rotation curve. However, unlike the NFW model with a smooth radial density distribution, the present model predicts a significant\nfluctuation of rotation velocity in both angular and radial directions. Since the underlying density field, which\ngives rise to this velocity fluctuations, is scale free, the\nvelocity fluctuation power spectrum is expected to be a\npower law. Though the fractal model has many free parameters, the only relevant parameters for the index of\nthis power law are n and fr while the rest of them will\njust introduce different multiplicative scaling. This prediction can be easily verified from high spatial and spectral resolution observation of neutral hydrogen of normal\ngalaxies. Note that part of this fluctuations will cancel\nout for the spherically averaged rotation curve and hence\nit is important to use the full velocity field to search for\nsuch scale free fluctuations. It is also important to note\nthat fluctuations of the velocity field of the hydrogen gas\nwill have contributions from the local density perturbations of the disk. But the scale dependence of these perturbations may makes it possible to disentangle the scale\nfree perturbations due to the halo substructures. There\nis some indication of such a power law scaling of the\nrotation velocity fluctuation power spectra from direct\nobservation and analysis of the H i 21 cm velocity field\nof some nearby galaxy (Dutta et al. 2010). We leave a\nmore detailed treatment of this aspect to a future work.\n\n\f5\n4. DISCUSSION\nThroughout this analysis we have assumed that the\nclump distribution in this model has an approximate\nspherical symmetry. This assumption is most likely to\nbe untrue in reality. Due to small count, bigger substructures are more likely to cause departure from spherical symmetry. In this situation, rotation velocity field\nwill also have strong azimuthal asymmetry. Observationally, about half of the spiral galaxies show some degree of kinematical lopsidedness (Richter & Sancisi 1994;\nHaynes et al. 1998; Swaters et al. 2008; Sofue & Rubin\n2001; Jog & Combes 2009) which may originate from\ntidal distortion partly due to deviation from spherical\nsymmetry of the underlying gravitational potential of the\nlopsided dark matter halo (Chakrabarti & Blitz 2009;\nSaha et al. 2008). Due to their large number, smaller\nsubstructures are likely to have relatively more symmetrical distribution. So, the velocity fluctuations spectrum\nis expected to show a power law scaling at large spatial frequency (large k, i.e., small physical scale), and a\ndeparture from power law at small k.\nWe have also assumed in this analysis that the baryons\nwill not significantly affect the galactic dynamics. However, some recent numerical studies (e.g. Weinberg et al.\n2008; Romano-D\u0131\u0301az et al. 2008, 2009) have shown that\nthe presence of baryons have effects like flattening the\ncentral cusp, reducing the halo triaxiality, and introducing bias in clustering with environment density. Effectively, baryon dissipation may destroy the similarity between different scales of clustering. However,\nRomano-D\u0131\u0301az et al. (2010) have found that phenomenon\nlike \"efficient feedback from stellar evolution and the central supermassive black holes\" may counterbalance this\neffect to some extent. On the other hand, Knebe et al.\n(2010) have found no significant effect of baryonic physics\non properties like shape and radial alignment of substructures. Numerical simulations also suggest that, even in\nthe presence of baryons, the subhalo mass function remains a power law though the power law index changes\nfrom \u22120.99 to \u22121.13 (Romano-D\u0131\u0301az et al. 2010). It is,\nhence, important to keep in mind that, in a realistic situation, baryon dissipation may alter the velocity fluctuations causing a significant departure from the scale free\nvelocity fluctuations.\nWe note that the key result of this analysis, that is\nan NFW-like rotation curve for the fractal model, is\nnot crucially dependent on the exact density profile of\nindividual halos. A variety of density profile without\nany central singularity (variant of non-singular isothermal sphere) will leads to a similar NFW-like rotation\ncurve. This strongly suggests that the clustering properties of the dark matter particles dominantly govern the\nradial density profile of the halo. Finally, these assembly\nof substructures will give rise to a flat NFW-like rotation curve for normal galaxies. But, for more dark matter dominated low mass dwarf galaxies and low surface\nbrightness galaxies, depending on the exact form of the\nnon-singular density profile, the dominant contribution\nof the central big halo may make the rotation curve for\nsuch galaxies intrinsically different which is consistent\nwith observational results (de Blok 2002, 2005).\n5. CONCLUSIONS\n\n1. The dark matter halo substructures at galactic\nscale is found to significantly affect the rotation\ncurve.\n2. A self-consistent model of statistically self-similar\nhierarchical dark matter substructures predicts an\nNFW-like rotation curve, though each clump has\na non-singular isothermal density profile. This\nNFW-like rotation curve emerges out of the fractal geometry and is independent of specific density\nprofile of individual clumps.\n3. The model predicts a scale free power spectrum\nof the rotation velocity fluctuations which can be\nobservationally verified.\n4. The model also provides some plausible explanation of the observed intrinsic difference between the\ndark matter halo density profile of normal galaxies\nand dark matter dominated low mass dwarf galaxies and low surface brightness galaxies.\n\nWe are grateful to Rajaram Nityananda for many useful comments on an earlier version of this paper.
