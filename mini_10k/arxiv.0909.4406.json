The central interaction\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe phenomenon of a magnetic Feshbach resonance\n(MFR) is widely used for the manipulation of systems of\nultracold atoms. One field of interest is the combination\nof the photoassociation (PA) of molecules with MFRs. It\nhas been shown, both theoretically and experimentally,\nthat the PA transfer rate can be significantly increased\nin the vicinity of an MFR [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. This leads to the\nprospect of creating a large number of ultracold molecules\nout of a sample of ultracold atoms. These molecules are\nof great interest for applications in quantum information\nprocessing [6, 7], the exploration of lattices of dipolar\nmolecules [8], or ultracold chemical reactions [9, 10].\nFor all PA schemes that exploit the enhancement of\nPA at an MFR, the understanding of the interplay between both processes is important. Here, we seek to describe the process by a two-channel (TC) approximation\n[11]. In [5] this approximation has recently been used to\npredict the behavior of the PA transition rate as a function of the scattering length. We review this approach\nand find a simplified expression with only two instead\nof three free parameters. These two parameters which\ncan be, e.g., the maximal transition rate and the position of the minimal transition rate can be obtained either from multi-channel (MC) calculations or from experimental observations. They can serve as a classification\nof transition processes and reveal a universal dependence\nof the enhancement of the transition rate on the position\nof vanishing transition rate.\nThe Hamiltonian of relative motion for two colliding\nground-state alkali-metal atoms is given by [12]\n\u0124 = T\u0302\u03bc +\n\n2\nX\n\n(V\u0302jhf + V\u0302jZ ) + V\u0302int\n\n(1)\n\nj=1\n\nwhere T\u0302\u03bc is the kinetic energy and \u03bc is the reduced mass.\naj\nThe hyperfine operator V\u0302jhf = ~hf2 ~sj * ~ij and the Zeeman\n~ in the presence of a magoperator V\u0302jZ = (\u03b3e~sj \u2212 \u03b3n~ij ) * B\n~\nnetic field B depend on the electronic spin ~sj , the nuclear\nspin ~ij , the hyperfine constant aj of atom j = 1, 2, and\nhf\n\nV\u0302int (R) = V0 (R)P\u03020 + V1 (R)P\u03021\n\n(2)\n\nis a combination of singlet and triplet Born-Oppenheimer\npotentials V0 (R) and V1 (R) where P\u03020 and P\u03021 project respectively on the singlet and triplet components of the\nscattering wave function.\nFor low collision energies the eigenfunctions of Hamiltonian (1) may be written as a superposition\nX\n|\u03a8i =\n\u03a8\u03b1 (R)|\u03b1i\n(3)\n\u03b1\n\nof s-wave functions in the atomic basis |\u03b1i =\n|f1 , mf1 i|f2 , mf2 i. Here, f~j = ~sj + ~ij is the total spin\nof atom j and mf its projection onto the B-field axis.\nIn the following we consider an elastic collision, where\nonly the entrance channel with spin configuration |\u03b10 i is\nopen and all other coupled channels are closed.\nWithin the TC approximation of the scattering process one projects the full MC Hilbert space onto two\nsubspaces, the one of the closed channels (with projection operator Q\u0302) and the one of the open entrance channel (with projection operator P\u0302) [11]. The resulting TC\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation reads\n(\u0124P \u2212 E)|\u03a8P i + \u0174|\u03a8Q i = 0\n\u2020\n\n(\u0124Q \u2212 E)|\u03a8Q i + \u0174 |\u03a8P i = 0 ,\n\n(4)\n(5)\n\nwith \u0124P = P\u0302\u0124P\u0302, \u0124Q = Q\u0302\u0124Q\u0302, \u0174 = P\u0302\u0124Q\u0302, |\u03a8P i = P\u0302|\u03a8i\nand |\u03a8Q i = Q\u0302|\u03a8i.\nAn MFR occurs, if the energy E of the system is close\nto the eigenenergy E0 of a bound state |\u03a6b i of the closedchannel subspace. Following the solution in [13] we assume that the closed-channel wave function is simply a\nmultiple A of the bound state |\u03a6b i, i.e. |\u03a8Q i = A |\u03a6b i.\nThis is equivalent to the usual one-pole approximation.\nEquation (4) may be solved via the Greens operator\n\u011cP = (E + i\u01eb \u2212 \u0124P )\u22121 with \u01eb \u2192 0+ .\nThe general solution thus reads\n|\u03a8P i = C|\u03a6reg i + A\u011cP \u0174|\u03a6b i ,\n|\u03a8Q i = A|\u03a6b i\n\n(6)\n(7)\n\n\f2\nwhere C is a normalization constant and |\u03a6reg i is the\nregular solution of \u0124P |\u03a8i = E|\u03a8i.\nFollowing the procedure given in [13] one arrives at the\nclosed-channel admixture\nr\n2\nsin \u03b4res ,\n(8)\nA = \u2212C\u0303\n\u03c0\u0393\nwith the normalization constant C\u0303 = C/ cos \u03b4res . The\nGreens operator \u011cP explicitly given in [13] yields a long\nrange behavior of the open channel\nr\n2\u03bc\n\u03a8P (R)|R\u2192\u221e = C\u0303\nsin(kR + \u03b4bg + \u03b4res ) . (9)\n\u03c0~2 k\nThe total phase shift \u03b4 = \u03b4bg + \u03b4res results from the\nbackground phase shift \u03b4bg of the regular solution |\u03a6reg i,\nwhich is connected to the background scattering length\nabg = \u2212 limk\u21920 tan \u03b4bg /k, and a contribution \u03b4res due to\nthe resonant coupling to the bound state. The resonant\nphase shift has the functional form\ntan \u03b4res = \u2212\n\n\u0393/2\nE \u2212 ER\n\n(10)\n\nwhere ER = E0 + h\u03a6b |\u0174\u2020 \u011cP \u0174|\u03a6b i lies close to the energy of the bound state E0 (B). The width of the resonance is given by \u0393 = 2\u03c0|h\u03a6b |\u0174|\u03a6reg i|2 .\nOne assumes that ER depends approximately linearly\non the magnetic field, i.e. for E \u2192 0 there is some \u03c3\nand BR such that ER = \u03c3(B \u2212 BR ). This yields with\n\u2206B \u2261 \u0393(2kabg \u03c3)\u22121 the well known relation [14]\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2206B\n(11)\nasc = abg 1 +\nB \u2212 BR\nwhich allows to determine the resonant phase shift\ntan \u03b4res =\n\nkabg \u2206B\nBR \u2212 B\n\n(12)\n\nfrom experimentally accessible quantities.\nEquipped with the MC solution a convenient way to\ncalculate transition rates to molecular bound states is to\ntransform the scattering wave function of Eq. (3) to the\nmolecular basis |\u03c7i = |S, MS i|mi1 , mi2 i where S and MS\nare the quantum numbers of the total electronic spin and\nits projection along the magnetic field and mi1 , mi2 are\nthe nuclear spin projections of the individual atoms.\nWithin the dipole approximation with electronic\ndipole transition moment D(R) the free-bound transition rate \u0393(B) to the final molecular state |\u03a8f i =\n\u03a8\u03bd (R) M\nR YJ (\u0398, \u03a6)|\u03c7f i with vibrational quantum number \u03bd\nand rotational quantum number J is then proportional\nto the squared dipole transition moment [15]\n\nIMC (B) =\n\nZ\u221e\n0\n\n2\n\n\u03a8\u03bd (R)D(R)\u03c8\u03c7f (R)dR\n\n.\n\n(13)\n\nSelection rules allow only transitions from the s-wave\nscattering function to a final state with J = 1. Due to\nthe orthogonality of the molecular basis, only one molecular channel \u03c8\u03c7f (R) with the same spin state as the final\nstate has to be considered.\nThe solutions (6,7) of the TC approximation yield together with the behavior of the closed channel admixture\nin (8) a squared dipole transition moment\nITC (B) = |h\u03a8f |D\u0302|\u03a8i|2\n\n2\n\n= |C\u0303|2 |C1 cos \u03b4res \u2212 C2 sin \u03b4res | , (14)\np\nwhere C2 = 2/\u03c0\u0393(h\u03a8f |D\u0302\u011cP \u0174|\u03a6b i + h\u03a8f |D\u0302|\u03a6b i) and\nC1 = h\u03a8f |D\u0302|\u03a6reg i do not vary with the magnetic field\nB. The prefactor C\u0303 may vary with asc . However, in\nthe following we consider energy-normalized scattering\nsolutions with C\u0303 \u2261 1. Introducing \u03b2 = |C\u0303|2 (C12 + C22 )\nand tan \u03b40 = C1 /C2 one can further simplify Eq. (14) to\nITC (B) = \u03b2 sin2 (\u03b4res \u2212 \u03b40 ) .\n\n(15)\n\nDue to the low-energy\nbehavior of the regular solution\n\u221a\n\u0393 \u221d k and C1 \u221d k holds for k \u2192 0 [12]. Therefore one\ncan associate a finite length\ntan \u03b40\nk\u21920\nk\n\nae = \u2212 lim\n\n(16)\n\nwith the phase shift \u03b40 .\nLet us point out some differences to the previously derived result for the dipole transition moment in [5]. In\nthe notation of the current work Eq. (8) in [5] gives\nITC (B) = K|1 + C1 tan \u03b4res + C2 sin \u03b4res |2\n\n(17)\n\n2\nwith K = |h\u03a8p\nf |D\u0302|\u03a6reg i| , C1 = h\u03a8f |D\u0302|\u03a6irr i/h\u03a8f |D\u0302|\u03a6reg i,\nand C2 = \u2212 2/\u03c0\u0393h\u03a8f |D\u0302|\u03a6b i/h\u03a8f |D\u0302|\u03a6reg i. The most\nobvious difference to Eq. (14) is the dependence on three\nparameters K, C1 and C2 and not just two. This is a result of an inconsistent normalization of open and closed\nchannels in [5]. The open channel was not energy normalized and leads thus to a term proportional to tan \u03b4res .\nFurthermore, the open channel was described as a pure\nsum of regular and irregular solution. This may, however,\nonly be done for interatomic distances, were the coupling\nto the closed channels induced by the exchange energy is\nnegligible. A fit of Eq. (17) to a full MC calculation\nseemed to be nevertheless possible which might however\nbe the result of the freedom of three fitting parameters.\nThe universal dependence of the PA transition rates\non just two parameters in Eq. (15) reveals an important\nphysical aspect. The enhancement of the transition rate\nis directly connected to the position of vanishing transition rate. On the one hand the transition rate is van(min)\nishing at a scattering length asc\n= abg + ae or at a\ncorresponding magnetic field\n\nBmin = BR + \u2206B\n\nabg\n.\nae\n\n(18)\n\n\f3\n\nasc in units of a0\n\n20\n\nBR1 = 1066.917 G\nDB1 = 10.47 G\n\nIHBL in a.u.\n\n10\n10\n10\n10\n10\n10\n\nIHBL in a.u.\n\nof the maximum transition rate \u0393max and the background\nrate \u0393bg in the presence of an off-resonant magnetic field\n(i.e. where \u03b4res = 0).\nIn order to verify the TC description of the PA process,\nwe consider the exemplary case of an elastic collision of\n6\nLi-87 Rb (6 Li is atom 1, 87 Rb is atom 2) in the initial\natomic basis state |\u03b10 i = |1/2, 1/2i|1, 1i. For an energy\n50 Hz above the threshold of the entrance channel which\nis well in the s-wave scattering regime the MC solution\nwas calculated for different magnetic fields B in [16]. For\nB < 1500 G two s-wave resonances occur, a broad one at\nB = 1066, 917 G which was also observed experimentally\n[17], and a narrow one at B = 1282.576 G.

With this quadratic\nexpansion, a fit according to Eq. (20) excellently reflects\nthe MC behavior as shown in Fig. 1.\nWe consider the exemplary case of a dipole transitions\nof the scattering state to the absolute vibrational ground\nstate of the electronic singlet configuration X 1 \u03a3+ and the\ntriplet configuration a3 \u03a3+ . These transitions take place\nat internuclear distances where the coupling between all\natomic channels is strong such that any deficiency of the\nTC description would become obvious. The MC rate\nwas calculated in [16] for an electronic dipole moment\n\na function of the external magnetic field for 6 Li-87 Rb scattering at E = 50 Hz (dots). Transitions to the molecular singlet\nstate |0, 0i|0, 3/2i (a) and the triplet states |1, \u22121i|1, 3/2i (b) and\n|1, 1i|1, \u22121/2i (c) are considered.

In the following we use D0 = 0\nand D1 = Eh /a0 . The magnetic field dependence of the\naccording dipole transition moment to ground states in\ndifferent spin configurations is shown in Fig. 2.\nWe fit the MC behavior by assuming again that the two\nresonances are sufficiently separated, such that one can\n(j)\n(j)\nadd the transition amplitudes ATC (B) = C0 cos(\u03b4res ) \u2212\n(j)\nCj sin(\u03b4res ) of both resonances j = 1, 2 independently\nand take the absolute square of the sum\n(1,2)\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\nITC (B) = |ATC (B) + ATC (B)|2\n\n(21)\n\nin order to determine the dipole transition moment. The\n(j)\nresonant phase shifts tan \u03b4res = kabg (B)\u2206Bj /(BRj \u2212 B)\nfor j = 1, 2 are in analogy to Eq. (12) associated to the\nresonant coupling to two different closed-channel bound\nstates. Since C0 does not depend on the resonant molecular bound state |\u03a6b i, it is independent of the magnetic\nfield B. Hence, for describing a transition process to a\nspecific molecular state for two well separated resonances,\none needs only three independent parameters.\n\n\f4\nTABLE I: Enhancement of the dipole transition rate between off-resonant and resonant magnetic field in MC and\nTC description for transitions to all eight possible spin states\n|S, MS i|mi1 , mi2 i at the two resonances at BR1 = 1066, 917 G\nand BR2 = 1282.576 G.\nMolecular\nstate\n\nResonance 1\nResonance 2\n(2)\n(1)\nmax\noff\nmax\noff\n/IMC\n(k ae )\u22122\nIMC\n/IMC\n(k ae )\u22122 IMC\n\n|0, 0i|0, 23 i\n|0, 0i|1, 12 i\n|1, \u22121i|1, 32 i\n|1, 0i|0, 32 i\n|1, 0i|1, 12 i\n|1, 1i| \u2212 1, 32 i\n|1, 1i|0, 12 i\n|1, 1i|1, \u2212 21 i\n\n5.81 * 106\n2.62 * 108\n1.80 * 105\n8.86 * 106\n5.04 * 109\n5.77 * 106\n1.88 * 107\n1.09 * 1010\n\n5.83 * 106\n3.49 * 108\n1.75 * 105\n8.69 * 106\n2.14 * 109\n8.41 * 106\n2.13 * 107\n1.18 * 1012\n\n6.85 * 1012\n6.57 * 106\n5.73 * 107\n1.63 * 1013\n2.15 * 108\n7.76 * 1012\n1.32 * 1013\n3.66 * 107\n\n1.39 * 1013\n1.27 * 107\n5.41 * 107\n5.93 * 1013\n4.71 * 107\n5.21 * 1013\n6.57 * 1013\n4.41 * 107\n\nAdditionally a fit to the behavior\n(j)\n\n(j)\n\n(j)\nITC (B) = \u03b2j sin2 (\u03b4res\n\u2212 \u03b40 )\n\n(22)\n\nfor j = 1, 2 is performed which neglects respectively one\n(j)\nresonance. Again one can connect the phase shifts \u03b40\n(j)\nto the corresponding lengths ae via Eq. (16) which allows also to validate the applicability of Eq. (19) for both\nresonances separately.\nConsidering Fig. 2 one finds that for all shown transitions the TC approximation for two well separated resonances excellently describes the magnetic-field dependence of the MC transition rate. The behavior of Eq. (22)\nreproduces each of the MC resonances j = 1, 2 in an interval of several \u2206Bj around the resonant magnetic fields\nBRj . With only one parameter more than for the description of a single resonance, both resonances can be\nwell described by Eq. (21). This is remarkable, since the\nbehavior of the transition rates to all four different spin\nconfigurations are quite different. Nevertheless all features are reproduced by just three parameters.\n\n[1] F. A. van Abeelen, D. J. Heinzen, and B. J. Verhaar,\nPhys. Rev. A 57, R4102 (1998).\n[2] P. Courteille, R. S. Freeland, D.

Lett. 97, 033003\n(2006).\n\nThe good description of the MC transition rates by\nEq. (22) suggests that Eq. (19) indeed reflects the dependence of the PA enhancement on the position of vanishing transition rate. In Eq. (19) the enhancement was\ndefined relative to the transition rate at the background\nscattering length. This point is reached, however, only\nat infinite detuning from the resonant magnetic field BR .\nIn order to nevertheless verify the validity of Eq. (19) we\nmax\nrelate the maximal transition rate IMC\nat each resonance\noff\nseparately to the transition rate IMC = IMC (800 G) far\naway from both resonances. We do not choose a magnetic field with larger detuning to avoid effects of other\nresonant molecular bound states. In Tab. I the ratio\nmax\noff\nIMC\n/IMC\nis compared for both resonances to the prediction of Eq. (19) for transitions to the vibrational ground\nstates of all eight possible spin configurations in the\nmolecular basis. One finds that the order of magnitude\ngenerally agrees excellently. Only for few transitions such\nas the one to the molecular states |1, 1i|1, \u22121/2i at the\nfirst (broad) resonance the orders of magnitude differ significantly. A view on Fig. 2 (c) reveals that this is not\nrelated to a break down of Eq. (19), but that the absence of a vanishing transition rate leads to a comparably\noff\nslow degradation of the transition rate such that IMC\nis\nnot a good representation for the background transition\nrate. On the other hand, for transitions for which the\nbackground transition rate is quickly approached when\ndetuning from the resonance, the two estimates of the\nenhancement agree even to the first significant digit (see\nthe third row in Tab. I and the corresponding Fig. 2 (b)).\nThis and the results above demonstrate that the TC approximation provides an excellent basis to understand PA\nprocesses in the presence of an external magnetic field inducing an MFR.\nWe thank Y.
