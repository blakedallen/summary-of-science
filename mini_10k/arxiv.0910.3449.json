Acceleration of particles \u2013 ISM: cosmic rays \u2013 ISM: supernova remnants \u2013 Galaxies: jets\n\n1. Introduction\nThe origin of cosmic rays (CRs) has been one of the longstanding problems. The number spectrum of nuclear CRs\nobserved at the Earth, N (E) \u221d E \u2212s , shows a break at\nthe \"knee\" energy (\u2248 1015.5 eV), below which the spectral index is about s \u2248 \u22122.7 (Cronin 1999). Because of the\nenergy-dependent propagation of CRs, the spectral shape\nat the source is different from that observed at the Earth.\nTaking into account the propagation effect, the source spectral index has been well constrained as s \u2248 2.2 \u2212 2.4 in various models (e.g., Strong & Moskalenko 1998; Putze et al.\n2009). This value of s has been also inferred in order\nto explain the Galactic diffuse gamma-ray emission (e.g.,\nStrong et al. 2000). This fact may give us valuable insights\non the acceleration mechanism of CRs.\nMechanisms of CR acceleration have also been studied\nfor a long time and the most plausible process is a diffusive\nshock acceleration (DSA) (Krymsky 1977; Axford et al.\n1977; Bell 1978; Blandford & Ostriker 1978). Very highenergy gamma-ray observations have revealed that the existence of high-energy particles at the shock of young supernova remnants (SNRs), which supports the DSA mechanism as well as the paradigm that the Galactic CRs\nare produced by young SNRs (e.g., Enomoto et al. 2002;\nAharonian et al. 2004, 2005; Katagiri et al. 2005). Recent\nprogress of the theory of DSA has revealed that the backreactions of accelerated CRs are important if a large num-\n\nber of nuclear particles are accelerated (Drury & V\u00f6lk\n1981; Malkov & Drury 2001). There are several observational facts which are consistent with the predictions of\nsuch nonlinear model (Vink & Laming 2003; Bamba et al.\n2003, 2005a,b; Warren et al. 2005; Uchiyama et al. 2007;\nHelder et al. 2009). The model predicts, however, the\nharder spectrum of accelerated particles at the shock than\nf (p) \u221d p\u22124 (corresponding to s = 2) where p is the momentum of CRs, in particular, near the knee energy (Malkov\n1997; Berezhko & Ellison 1999; Kang et al. 2001). This fact\napparently contradicts with the source spectral index of\ns \u2248 2.2 \u2212 2.4 inferred from the CR spectrum at the Earth.\nEven in the test-particle limit of DSA, such a soft source\nspectrum requires a shock with the small Mach number\n(M <\n\u223c 10), which is unexpected for young SNRs.\nThere are several models of DSA, depending on the\nboundary conditions imposed. Different models predict different spectra of CRs dispersed from the shock region. So\nfar, the age-limited acceleration has been frequently considered as a representative case (\u00a7 2). In this model, all\nthe particles are stored around the shock while accelerated.\nWhen the confinement becomes inefficient, all the particles run away from the region at a time. Then, the source\nspectrum of CRs which has just escaped from the acceleration region is expected to be the same as that at the shock\nfront. Therefore, this model predicts that the source spectrum is the same as that of accelerated particles, which is\n\n\f2\n\nOhira et al.: Escape-limited Model of Cosmic-ray Acceleration Revisited\n\ntypically harder than the observed one. In this paper, we\nconsider an alternative model, the escape-limited acceleration, to explain the observed CR spectrum at the Earth\n(\u00a7 3). This model is preferable to the age-limited acceleration when we consider observational results for young SNR\nRX J1713.7\u22123946, of which TeV \u03b3-ray emission is more\nprecisely measured than any others (\u00a7 4.1).\nThe nature of CRs with energies much higher than the\nknee energy is also still uncertain. While CRs below the\nsecond knee (\u223c 1017.5 eV) may be Galactic origin, the\nhighest energy CRs above \u223c 1018.5 eV are believed to be\nextragalactic. Possible candidates are active galactic nuclei (AGNs) (e.g., Biermann & Strittmatter 1987; Takahara\n1990; Rachen & Biermann 1993; Pe'er et al. 2009), gammaray bursts (Waxman 1995; Vietri 1995; Murase et al. 2006),\nmagnetars (Arons 2003; Murase et al. 2009) and clusters of\ngalaxies (Kang et al. 1997; Inoue et al. 2007). The intermediate energy range from \u223c 1017.5 eV to \u223c 1018.5 eV is\nmore uncertain. Both the Galactic and extragalactic origins are possible and it may just a transition between the\ntwo. As the extragalactic origin, AGNs (Berezinsky et al.\n2006), clusters of galaxies (Murase et al. 2008) and hypernovae (Wang et al. 2007) have been proposed so far.\nAmong these possibilities, AGN is one of the most\nplausible candidates for accelerators of high-energy CRs,\nbecause it can explain the UHECR spectrum above \u223c\n1017.5 eV assuming the proton composition. In such a proton dip model, the source spectrum of UHECRs is N \u221d E \u2212s\nwith s = 2.4\u20132.7, depending on models of the source evolution (Berezinsky et al. 2006). The required source spectral index of s = 2.4\u20132.7 can be explained by several possibilities. First, it can be attributed to the acceleration\nmechanism itself. One can consider non-Fermi acceleration\nmechanisms (Berezinsky et al. 2006) or the two-step diffusive shock acceleration in two different shocks (Aloisio et al.\n2007). Second, the index can be attributed to a superposition of many AGNs with different maximum energies, and\none can suppose that AGNs with different luminosities may\nhave different maximum energies (Kachelriess & Semikoz\n2006). Recently, Berezhko (2008) proposed another possibility under the cocoon shock model. In this cocoon shock\nscenario, different maximum energies can be interpreted as\nmaximum energies of escaping particles at different ages of\nAGN jets. Although it is very uncertain whether efficient\nCR acceleration occurs there, this scenario would also be\none of the possibilities to be investigated in detail.\nThe organization of the paper is as follows. After the\nbrief introduction of the age-limited model of the CR acceleration (\u00a7 2), we study the escape-limited model in \u00a7 3.\nFor a simple understanding, the general argument in a stationary, test-particle approximation is given in \u00a7 3.1. Then,\nwe derive the formulae of the maximum energy of accelerated particles in \u00a7 3.2, and of the spectrum of escaping\nparticles in \u00a7 3.3. We consider the applications to young\nSNR and AGN in \u00a7 4 and \u00a7 5, respectively. Section 6 is\ndevoted to a discussion.\n\n2. Maximum Attainable Momentum in the\nAge-limited Acceleration\nFor comparison with the escape-limited acceleration, we\nbriefly summarize the case of the age-limited acceleration.\nIn this case, the maximum momentum of accelerated parti-\n\n(age)\n\ncles, pm , is determined by tacc = tage , where tage and tacc\nare the age of the shock and the acceleration time scale, respectively. When we consider DSA, tacc is given by (Drury\n1983)\n\u0012\n\u0013\n3\nD1 (p) D2 (p)\ntacc =\n,\n(1)\n+\nu1 \u2212 u2\nu1\nu2\nwhere D(p) and u are the diffusion coefficient as a function\nof the momentum of accelerated particles and the velocity\nof the background fluid, respectively. Subscripts 1 and 2\nrepresent upstream and downstream regions, respectively.\nFor simplicity, we assume the Bohm-type diffusion, i.e.,\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03b7g mp c3\np\nD1 (p) = D2 (p) =\n,\n(2)\n3eB\nmp c\nwhere B, \u03b7g and mp are the magnetic field strength, the\ngyro-factor and the proton mass, respectively. Taking into\naccount that the fluid velocities are related to the shock\nvelocity, ush , as u1 = \u03c3u2 = ush , where \u03c3 is the compression ratio of the shock, we derive (e.g., Aharonian & Atoyan\n1999)\np(age)\n=\nm\n\n\u03c3 \u2212 1 eB 2\nu tage .\n\u03c3(\u03c3 + 1) \u03b7g c2 sh\n\n(3)\n\n3. Escape-limited Acceleration\nIn the frame work of DSA, accelerated particles are scattered by the turbulent magnetic field, and go back and forth\nacross the shock front. Upstream turbulence may be excited\nby the accelerated particles themselves (Bell 1978), and\nthe magnetic field strength of such turbulence is theoretically expected to be strong (e.g., Lucek & Bell 2000). There\nare observational evidences suggesting that CRs are responsible for substantial amplification of the ambient magnetic field in the precursors of shock fronts in SNRs, and\nthat such magnetic turbulence well confines the particles\naround the shock front (Vink & Laming 2003; Bamba et al.\n2003, 2005a,b; Yamazaki et al. 2004; Parizot et al. 2006;\nUchiyama et al. 2007), leading to the efficient CR acceleration.\nThe spectrum of accelerated particles is affected by\nthe spatial and spectral structures of the magnetic turbulence through the process in which the particles escape from the shock toward far upstream region. There\nare mainly two scenarios of the escape model considered\nso far; one causes the effect on the boundary in the momentum space, and the other causes the effect on the spatial boundary. The former comes from significant decay of\nthe wave amplitude below the wave number kmin of the\nspectrum of the turbulence (Reynolds 1998; Drury et al.\n2009). Particles with the Lorentz factor above \u03b3c satisfying\nthe resonance condition, \u03c9 \u2212 kmin v \u2212 \u03a9c (\u03b3c ) = 0, where\n\u03a9c (\u03b3) = eB/\u03b3mp c is the cyclotron frequency, are not confined around the shock front and escape into far upstream\nregion. In this context, the escape flux was calculated previously (e.g., Ptuskin & Zirakashvili 2005; Drury et al. 2009).\nThe latter effect has been recently discussed by several\nauthors (Ptuskin & Zirakashvili 2005; Reville et al. 2009;\nCaprioli et al. 2009). The turbulence generation may be\nconnected with the flux of accelerated particles themselves.\nHence, in the region far from the shock front, the flux of\n\n\fOhira et al.: Escape-limited Model of Cosmic-ray Acceleration Revisited\n\nhigh-energy particles is small and wave excitation is less significant. If the accelerated particles reach the region, they\nare dispersed into the far upstream region. Let l be the distance from the shock beyond which the amplitude of the upstream turbulence becomes negligible. Characteristic spatial length of particles penetrating into the upstream region\nis given by D(p)/ush . As long as D(p)/ush \u226a l, the particles\nare confined without the significant escape loss, and they\nare accelerated to higher energies. On the other hand, when\ntheir momentum increases up to sufficiently high energies\nsatisfying D(p)/ush >\n\u223c l, their acceleration ceases and they\nescape into the far upstream. Therefore, the maximum momentum of accelerated particles in this scenario is given by\nthe condition D(p)/ush \u223c l. In the following of the paper,\nwe consider the escape-limited model, where the maximum\nenergy is essentially determined by D(p)/ush <\n\u223c l.\n\nu1 l\n\nwith the boundary condition, f (x = \u2212l) = 0, where x = \u2212l\n(l > 0) is the upstream escape boundary. The fluid velocity\nu(x) is given by\n\u001a\nu1 (x < 0)\nu(x) =\n,\n(5)\nu2 (x > 0)\nwhere u1 and u2 are constants.

The maximum energy of accelerated particles\nWe have seen in \u00a7 3.1 that in the stationary, test-particle\ncase, the quantity pm given by Eq.

A simple case of stationary, test-particle approximation\nIn order to take an essential feature of the escape-limited\nacceleration, we calculate the escape flux and the maximum attainable energy of accelerated particles in the simplest case (see also Caprioli et al. 2009). Let us consider the\nstationary transport equation\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u2202f\n\u2202f\np du \u2202f\n\u2202\nu(x)\nD(p)\n+\n=\n+Q ,\n(4)\n\u2202x\n\u2202x\n\u2202x\n3 dx \u2202p\n\n3\n\nu1 l d ln D d ln D\nd2 \u03a6\nD(y)\nq\u2212\n= n\nh\nio2\n2\ndy\nD(y) dy\ndy\nu1 l\n1 \u2212 exp \u2212 D(y)\n)\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0015\u0015 \u0012\n\u00132\nu1 l\nd ln D\n\u2202 2 ln D\n+ 1 \u2212 exp \u2212\n.(10)\n\u2212\nD(y)\ndy\n\u2202y 2\n\u001a\u0014\n\nx=\u2212l\n\nSince q = 3\u03c3/(\u03c3 \u2212 1), we find from Eqs. (3) and (16)\n\n(8)\n\nLet us introduce a new variable y = ln p and a new\nfunction \u03a6(y) = ln \u03c6(p). Then, we expand \u03a6(y) around its\nmaximum value at y = ym . To do this, we calculate the\nfirst and the second derivatives as\n\u0014\n\u0015\nu l d ln D\nd\u03a6\n1\ni q\u2212 1\nh\n,\n(9)\n=\u2212\nu1 l\ndy\nD(y) dy\n1 \u2212 exp \u2212 D(y)\n\n(esc)\n\npm\n\n(age)\npm\n\n= (\u03c3 + 1)\n\nl\n.\nush tage\n\n(17)\n\nHence, as long as l \u226b ush tage which is expected in the\nearly phase of the shock, we don't need the escape-limited\nacceleration. However, if the shock evolves so that l \u226a\nush tage , we have to consider the effect of the particle escape,\nand we cannot simply apply the well-known result of agelimited acceleration, Eq. (3).\n\n\f4\n\nOhira et al.: Escape-limited Model of Cosmic-ray Acceleration Revisited\n\n3.3. The spectrum of CRs dispersed from an accelerator\nIn this subsection, we derive the time-integrated spectrum of CR particles which is dispersed from an accelerator. The derivation is essentially identical to that of\nPtuskin & Zirakashvili (2005). However, our argument is\nsimpler and more general, so the final form of the spectrum\n(Eqs. (27) and (28)) is more general. Note that our formalism is applicable not only to DSA but also to arbitrary\nacceleration processes.\nThe proton production rate, N (p, \u03c7)d\u03c7dp, at a certain\nepoch labeled by a parameter \u03c7, is defined as the number\nof protons with momentum between p and p + dp which\nis produced in the interval between \u03c7 and \u03c7 + d\u03c7. Here \u03c7\nis the parameter which describes the dynamical evolution\nof the accelerator - it can be either simply the age, or\nthe position of the shock front. It is expected that N (p, \u03c7)\ncontains the term of exponential cutoff at the momentum\npm (\u03c7) which depends on \u03c7 [see, for example, Eq. (25)]. The\nnumber of protons with momentum between p and p + dp\nthat is escaping from the accelerator at the epoch between\n\u03c7 and d\u03c7 is denoted by \u03c6(p, \u03c7)d\u03c7dp, and we assume\n4\u03c0p2 \u03c6(p, \u03c7)d\u03c7dp \u221d N (pm (\u03c7), \u03c7)G(p, \u03c7)d\u03c7dp ,\n\n(18)\n\nwhere\n\" \u0012\n\u00132 #\nln p \u2212 ln pm (\u03c7)\n,\nG(p, \u03c7) = exp \u2212\n\u03be\n\n(19)\n\nIn order to derive a simple analytical form, we approximate\nEq. (19) as\n\u221a\nG(p, \u03c7) \u2248 \u03c0\u03be * \u03b4(ln p \u2212 ln pm (\u03c7)) ,\n(21)\nIf we use a general mathematical formula for \u03b4-functions\nfor an arbitrary function g(\u03c7):\n(22)\n\ndg\nd\u03c7 \u03c7=\u03c7\n0\n\nwhere g(\u03c70 ) = 0, then Eq. (21) is rewritten as\n\nG(p, \u03c7) \u221d h\n\npm (\u03c7)\ni\n\ndpm\nd\u03c7 \u03c7=p\u22121 (p)\nm\n\n\u03b4(\u03c7 \u2212 p\u22121\nm (p)) ,\n\n(23)\n\nwhere p\u22121\nm (p) is the inverse function of pm (\u03c7), that is,\npm (p\u22121\n(p))\n= p and p\u22121\nm\nm (pm (\u03c7)) = \u03c7. Using Eqs. (18) and\n(23), we calculate Nesc (p) as\nNesc (p) \u221d\n\npN (p, p\u22121\n(p))\nh mi\ndpm\n\u22121\npm (p) d\u03c7\n\u22121\n\n\u03c7=pm (p)\n\n.\n\nwhich is a power-law with the index s and the exponential\ncut-off at pm (\u03c7). Substituting Eq. (25) into Eq. (24), we\nobtain\n\u0001\np1\u2212s K p\u22121\nm (p)\ni\nh\nNesc (p) \u221d\n.\n(26)\ndpm\np\u22121\nm (p) d\u03c7\n\u22121\n\u03c7=pm (p)\n\nIn particular, if K(\u03c7) and pm (\u03c7) are written by the powerlaw forms, such as K(\u03c7) \u221d \u03c7\u03b2 and pm (\u03c7) \u221d \u03c7\u2212\u03b1 , then,\n\u22121/\u03b1\np\u22121\n, so that Eq. (26) becomes\nm (p) \u221d p\nNesc (p) \u221d p\u2212sesc ,\n\n(27)\n\nwhere\n\nand \u03be < 1. This is because we expect that particles with\nmomentum around pm (\u03c7) is most efficiently escaping from\nthe source. Indeed, as shown in \u00a7 3.1, Eqs. (18) and (19)\nare good approximation in the test-particle, stationary case.\nHere, we simply expect these assumptions are also correct\nin general.\nThe time-integrated spectrum of protons which have escaped at the source, Nesc (p), is obtained by\nZ\n2\nNesc (p) = 4\u03c0p\n\u03c6(p, \u03c7)d\u03c7 .\n(20)\n\n\u03b4(\u03c7 \u2212 \u03c70 )\n\u03b4(g(\u03c7)) = h i\n,\n\nThis is the most general analytical formula of the spectrum\nof protons dispersed from an accelerator.\nIn the following of the paper, the form of N (p, \u03c7) is\nassumed to have\n\u0012\n\u0013\u2212s\np\nN (p, \u03c7)d\u03c7dp = K(\u03c7)\nmp c\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0014 \u0012\np\nd log \u03c7 dp ,\n\u00d7 exp \u2212\npm (\u03c7)\n(25)\n\n(24)\n\nsesc = s +\n\n\u03b2\n.\n\u03b1\n\n(28)\n\nThis is the simplest form of the spectrum of CRs which are\ndispersed from the acceleration region.\nGenerally speaking, in order to obtain the energy spectrum of accelerated particles, time-dependent kinetic equation should be solved. Instead, we have assumed that at\nan arbitrary epoch, the spectral form is given by Eq. (25).\nThis assumption is justified if the spectrum at the given\nepoch is dominated by those which are being accelerated\nat that time, in other words, if the particle spectrum does\nnot so much depend on the past acceleration history. For\nexample, in the case of the spherical expansion, accelerated\nparticles suffer adiabatic expansion after they are transported downstream of the shock and lose their energy (e.g.,\nYamazaki et al. 2006), so that the contribution of the previously accelerated particles is negligible. Strictly speaking,\neven if we consider the energy loss via adiabatic expansion,\nthe energy spectrum of accelerated particles does depend\non the past acceleration history in some cases. When we\nuse the shock radius Rsh as \u03c7, the final form of Eqs.\u0001 (27)\nand (28) is correct as long as \u03b2 > (s \u2212 1) \u03c3 \u22121 \u2212 1 (see\nAppendix), which is satisfied in the cases considered in \u00a7 4\nand \u00a7 5. Otherwise, the form of Eq. (25) is no longer a good\napproximation, and the final form of sesc is different from\nEq. (28) (see Appendix).\n\n4. Application to Young Supernova Remnants\n4.1. Inconsistency of age-limited acceleration with observed\nresults of RX J1713.7\u22123946\nRX J1713.7\u22123946 is a representative SNR from which\nbright TeV \u03b3-rays have been detected. The H.E.S.S. experiment measured the TeV spectrum and claimed that\nits shape was better explained by the hadronic model\n(Aharonian et al. 2006, 2007). Furthermore, evidences of\n\n\fOhira et al.: Escape-limited Model of Cosmic-ray Acceleration Revisited\n\namplified magnetic field (B >\n\u223c 0.1 mG) are derived from\nthe width of synchrotron X-ray filaments (Parizot et al.\n2006; see also Vink & Laming 2003; Bamba et al. 2003,\n2005a,b) and from time variation of synchrotron X-ray hot\nspots (Uchiyama et al. 2007). These facts also support the\nhadronic origin of TeV \u03b3-rays, because the leptonic, onezone emission model (e.g., Aharonian & Atoyan 1999) cannot explain the TeV-to-X-ray flux ratio. Hence it is natural\nto assume that the TeV \u03b3-rays are produced by the hadronic\nprocess although there are several arguments against this\ninterpretation (Butt 2008; Katz & Waxman 2008; Plaga\n2008).\nIn the age-limited case, Eq. (3) reads\n\u0013\n\u00112 \u0012 t\n\u0010\nush\nage\n3 BmG\nTeV , (29)\ncp(age)\n=\n8\u00d710\nm\n\u03b7g\n4000 km s\u22121\n103 yr\nwhere we adopt \u03c3 = 4, and BmG is the magnetic field\nstrength in units of mG.\nH.E.S.S. observation has revealed that the cutoff energy of TeV \u03b3-ray spectrum is low (Aharonian et al.\n2006, 2007), so that in the one-zone hadronic scenario\n(age)\nis\nthe maximum energy of protons, Emax,p = cpm\nestimated as 30\u2013100 TeV (Villante & Vissani 2007). If\nEmax,p < 100 TeV and B \u2248 1 mG, then Eq. (29)\ntells us \u03b7g >\n\u223c 80, implying far from the \"Bohm\nlimit\" (\u03b7g \u2248 1) which is inferred from the X-ray observation (Parizot et al. 2006; Yamazaki et al. 2004) or\nexpected theoretically (Lucek & Bell 2000; Bell 2004;\nReville et al. 2007; Giacalone & Jokipii 2007; Inoue et al.\n2009; Ohira et al. 2009b,c). This statement is recast if we\ninvolve recent results of X-ray observations. The precise Xray spectrum of RX J1713.7\u22123946 is revealed, which gives\n1/2\nush = 3.3 \u00d7 108 \u03b7g cm s\u22121 (Tanaka et al. 2008). Then,\nEq. (29) can be rewritten as (Yamazaki et al. 2009)\n\u0012\n\u0013\ntage\n3\ncp(age)\n=\n5\n\u00d7\n10\nB\nTeV .\n(30)\nmG\nm\n103 yr\n(age)\nHence, in order to obtain cpm < 100 TeV, we need B <\n\u223c\n20 \u03bcG in the context of the hadronic scenario of TeV \u03b3rays, which contradicts current estimates of the magnetic\nfield.\nA possible solution is to consider the escape-limited\nacceleration. One can find from Eq. (17) that if we take\nl \u223c 10\u22122 ush tage \u223c 0.04 pc, the maximum energy becomes\nn\no\nEmax,p = min cp(age)\n, cp(esc)\nm\nm\n\n= cp(esc)\nm\n\u223c 100 TeV ,\n\n(31)\n\nwhich is consistent with the observed gamma-ray spectrum.\nIn the following, we consider the model of escape-limited\nacceleration under simple assumptions, estimating the evolution of the number density and the maximum momentum\nof accelerated particles so as to discuss the spectral index,\nsesc , of Nesc (p).\n4.2. Evolution of pm\nTime evolution of the maximum momentum of accelerated\nparticles, pm , has been so far discussed in many contexts\n(e.g., Ptuskin & Zirakashvili 2003). One way to estimate pm\n\n5\n\nis to use Eq. (16). In this approach, a key parameter is the\nmagnetic field, which is likely amplified around the shock\nfront (Vink & Laming 2003; Bamba et al. 2003, 2005a,b;\nYamazaki et al. 2004; Uchiyama et al. 2007) and may depend on various physical quantities such as the shock velocity, the ambient density, and so on. At present, the evolution\nof the magnetic field is not well understood despite many\nworks (e.g., Niemiec et al. 2008; Riquelme & Spitkovsky\n2009; Ohira et al. 2009a; Luo & Melrose 2009). In addition, the evolution of another parameter \u03b7g is also unknown.\nThese facts prevents us from predicting pm rigorously.\nHere we adopt a different phenomenological approach\nbased on the assumption that young SNRs are responsible\nfor observed CRs below the knee (Gabici et al. 2009). The\nmaximum energy cpm is expected to increase up to the knee\nenergy (1015.5 eV) until the end of the free expansion phase,\ntSedov , and decreases from that epoch. As seen in \u00a7 4.1, pm\n(esc)\nis limited by the escape at t > tSedov , that is pm = pm .\nThen, to reproduce the observed CR spectrum from \u223c GeV\nto the knee, we may assume a functional form of\np(esc)\nm (t) = pknee\n\n\u0012\n\nt\ntSedov\n\n\u0013\u22126.5/a\n\n,\n\n(32)\n(esc)\n\nwhere cpknee = 1015.5 eV, so that cpm = 1 GeV at t =\n10a tSedov . For later convenience, we change variables from\nt to the SNR radius Rsh in order to take \u03c7 = Rsh , where\n\u03c7 is a variable appeared in \u00a7 3.3. We further assume the\ndynamics of Rsh as\nRsh = RSedov\n\n\u0012\n\nt\ntSedov\n\n\u0013b\n\n,\n\n(33)\n\nwhere RSedov is the shock radius at t = tSedov . Then, we\nobtain\n\u0012\n\u0013\u22126.5/ab\nRsh\n(esc)\npm (Rsh ) = pknee\n,\n(34)\nRSedov\nso that we have \u03b1 = 6.5/ab (see the last paragraph of \u00a7 3.3).\nIf we adopt a \u2248 2.5 ad hoc, in addition to b \u2248 2/5 that\nis expected in the Sedov phase, then we find \u03b1 \u2248 6.5 as\na phenomenologically required value in the escape-limited\nmodel. Note that, even if the SNR dynamics is modified by\nthe CR escape, b is almost the same as one in the adiabatic\ncase and its effect on \u03b1 is expected to be so small that our\nconclusion is not affected qualitatively.\n4.3. Dynamics of SNR shock waves\nIn this subsection, we consider the dynamics of the SNR\nshock in order to estimate the evolution of the normalization factor of the spectrum K(Rsh ). A simple treatment of the dynamics of the SNR shock from the free\nexpansion to the adiabatic expansion (Sedov) phase has\nbeen given by several authors (Ostriker & McKee 1988;\nDrury et al. 1989; Bisnovatyi-Kogan & Silich 1995). Here\nwe extend their method taking account of the cooling by\nCR escape. The total mass of the SNR shock shell is calculated as\nZ Rsh\ndrr2 \u03c1am (r) ,\n(35)\nM (Rsh ) = Mej + 4\u03c0\n0\n\n\f6\n\nOhira et al.: Escape-limited Model of Cosmic-ray Acceleration Revisited\n\nwhere Mej and \u03c1am (r) are the ejecta mass and the density of ambient gas, respectively. The equation of motion of the thin shell is given by (Ostriker & McKee 1988;\nBisnovatyi-Kogan & Silich 1995)\nd(M u)\n2\n= 4\u03c0Rsh\n(Pin \u2212 Pam ) ,\ndt\n\n3\nWithout CR cooling\nCR Cooling\n\n2.5\n2\n1.5\n\u03b4\n\n(36)\n\n1\n\nwhere the gas velocity u is related to the shock velocity\nush and the adiabatic index \u03b3ad as u = 2ush /(\u03b3ad + 1).\nQuantities Pin and Pam are the pressures of the postshock gas and the ambient gas, respectively. For strong\nshocks, one can neglect Pam . The explosion energy E =\nEth + M u2 /2 + Qesc consists of the internal energy Eth =\n3\n4\u03c0Rsh\nPin /(3(\u03b3ad \u2212 1)), the kinetic energy, and the energy\nQesc which is carried by the escaping CRs. Then Eq. (36)\nis rewritten as\n\n0.5\n0\n-0.5\n10-2\n\n10-1\n\n100\n101\nTime [ t / tSedov ]\n\n102\n\nFig. 1. The index \u03b4 = d ln E/d ln Rsh as a function of time\nfor the case PS.

(35) and (39) to derive the dynamics of the SNR,\nush (Rsh ). We mainly consider the evolution of ush in the\nSedov phase. Hence, in the following, we simply assume\nthat \u03c1am is constant with r because even in the case of the\ncore-collapse supernova, the wind region is about a few pc\nand has been already passed by the SNR shock until the beginning of the Sedov phase. The energy carried by escaping\nparticles Qesc is written as\nZ pknee\ncpNesc (p)dp , (40)\nQesc (Rsh ) = \u0398(Rsh \u2212 RSedov )\npm (Rsh )\n\nwhere \u0398(x) is the Heaviside step function, i.e., \u0398(x) = 1\nfor x > 0 while \u0398(x) = 0 for x < 0. Substituting Eqs. (27),\n(28), and (34) into Eq.

To\nmake more realistic discussion, we should perform fluid simulations with CR back reaction, which is beyond the scope\nof this paper (e.g., Drury et al. 1989; V\u00f6lk et al. 2008).\n\n-1\n10-2\n\n10-1\n\n100\n101\nTime [ t / tSedov ]\n\n102\n\nFig. 2. The same as Fig. 1, but for the case PH.\n4.4. Evolution of K\nIn this subsection, we discuss the evolution of the normalization factor, K(Rsh ), of the spectrum of accelerated particles. At present, the injection process for CR acceleration at\nthe shock is not well understood. Hence, we consider two\nrepresentative scenarios of the injection process to model\nthe amount of the accelerated particles.\nAt first, we consider the same injection model as that\nof Ptuskin & Zirakashvili (2005). The model requires that\nthe CR pressure at the shock is proportional to the fluid\nram pressure, that is, PCR \u221d \u03c1am u2sh . The CR pressure at\nthe shock PCR is given by\nZ\n4\u03c0 pm (Rsh )\nPCR \u2248\ndpvp3 f0 (p) ,\n(42)\n3 mp c\nwhere we neglect the contribution of non-relativistic particles.

Note that PCR is approximately proportional to\nf0 (mp c) when s > 2, because in this case PCR only weakly\ndepends on pm . Hereafter, the cases of s > 2 and s < 2 are\ncalled PS and PH, respectively. Since PCR \u221d \u03c1am u2sh , the\nnormalization factor of the CR spectrum inside the SNR\nshock K(Rsh ) is calculated as\n\u001a\nE(Rsh )\n(PS)\n3\nK(Rsh ) \u221d Rsh f0 (mp c) \u221d\n(44)\n\u03b1(2\u2212s)\nE(Rsh )Rsh\n(PH) ,\nwhere the mechanical energy of the ejecta is (up to the\nnumerical coefficient)\nE(Rsh ) \u2248\n\n4\n3\n3\n\u03c0\u03c1am u2sh Rsh\n\u221d u2sh Rsh\n.\n3\n\nf0 (pinj ) \u221d \u03c1am /p3inj .\n\n(46)\n\n(47)\n\nwhere slow is the spectral index in the non-relativistic\nregime, that is, f0 (p) \u221d p\u2212slow \u22122 for pinj < p < mp c. We\nfurther assume the constant \u03c1am and pinj \u221d ush . Then we\n3+(s\n\u22121)(\u03b4\u22123)/2\nobtain K(Rsh ) \u221d Rsh low\n, so that \u03b2 = 3+(slow \u2212\n1)(\u03b4 \u22123)/2. Although the value of slow is uncertain, one can\nexpect slow \u2265 2. In the test particle approximation, one\nderives slow = s \u2265 2. If the nonlinear model of shock acceleration is considered, the spectrum f0 (p) is softer than p\u22124\nin the non-relativistic regime (Berezhko & Ellison 1999). In\nparticular, if slow \u2248 3, then \u03b2 \u2248 \u03b4, so that the value of \u03b4\nbecomes similar to those of PS case.\n1\n\n\u03b2=\n\n(\n\nWe search for approximate solutions to Eqs. (39), (41) and\n(48) which determine \u03b4 (and \u03b2) for given parameters \u03b1, s, \u03b7 and\n\u03b3ad . The procedure is as follows. For a trial value of \u03b2 which is\nassumed to be constant, we solve Eqs. (39) and (41) to obtain\nush (Rsh ) so as to calculate E and \u03b4 as functions of Rsh . It is\nfound that \u03b4 is almost time-independent after tSedov , hence we\ncan derive its average value in the epoch t > tSedov . Then, we\nupdate the value of \u03b2 using Eq. (48) with the average value of\n\u03b4. We repeat this procedure until the iteration converges.\n\n\u03b4\n(PS)\n\u03b4 + \u03b1(2 \u2212 s)\n(PH)\n3 + (slow \u2212 1)(\u03b4 \u2212 3)/2 (TL)\n\n.\n\n(48)\n\n4.5. The spectrum of escaping particles\nWe obtain from Eqs. (27), (28), and (48), the index of the\nmomentum spectrum of escaping particles as\nsesc =\n\nUsing this fact, we derive\n3\n3 slow \u22121\nK(Rsh ) \u221d Rsh\nf0 (mp c) \u221d \u03c1am Rsh\npinj\n,\n\nIn summary, the evolution of the normalization factor of\nthe spectrum of accelerated particles is given by K(Rsh ) \u221d\n\u03b2\nRsh\n, with\n\n(45)\n\nIf the explosion is adiabatic, E(Rsh ) is constant with Rsh\n\u22123/2\nduring the Sedov phase because ush \u221d Rsh . However, if\nthe modification of SNR dynamics via CR cooling is taken\ninto account (\u00a7 4.3), then ush is no longer proportional to\n\u22123/2\nRsh , and it is obtained by solving Eq. (39). In Figs. 1\nand 2, we show \u03b4 = d ln E/d ln Rsh as a function of time.\nFigure 1 is for the case PS in which we adopt \u03b7 = 0.2,\ns = 2.23, \u03b3ad = 5/3, and \u03b2 = \u22120.2, while Fig. 2 is for\nthe case PH with parameters \u03b7 = 0.2, \u03b3ad = 4/3, and \u03b2 =\n\u03b1(2\u2212s)\u22120.2. One can find that after t \u223c tSedov , \u03b4 is around\n\u22120.2, so that E(Rsh ) is approximately given by E(Rsh ) \u221d\n\u03b4\nRsh\nwith constant \u03b4 \u2248 \u22120.21 . For the case PS, the effect\nof CR cooling appears at the late time because low-energy\nCRs have a large fraction of the total energy of the escaping\nCRs. On the other hand, for the case PH, the effect emerges\nat an earlier epoch.\nNext, we consider the thermal leakage (TL) model\n(Malkov & V\u00f6lk 1995). This model requires the continuity of the distribution function f0 (p) to the downstream\nMaxwelian at the injection momentum pinj , namely\n\n7\n\n(\n\ns + \u03b4/\u03b1\n(PS)\n2 + \u03b4/\u03b1\n(PH)\ns + {3 + (slow \u2212 1)(\u03b4 \u2212 3)/2}/\u03b1 (TL)\n\n.\n\n(49)\n\nIn the following of this section, we discuss which injection\nmodel is suitable to make the galactic CR spectrum observed at Earth. We adopt \u03b1 = 6.5 as a typical value (see\n\u00a7 4.2) and sesc = 2.2 to make the Galactic CR spectrum. In\nthis paper, we assume sesc \u2248 2.2\u20132.4, where we believe that\nthe deviation from 2.0 is significant. This would be tested\nnot only from Galactic CR observations but also observations of extragalactic galaxies. Note that, even if we adopt\nsesc = 2.4, our results are qualitatively unchanged.\nIn the case PS, sesc is smaller than s because \u03b4 <\n\u223c 0,\nso that the model predicts the harder spectrum of escaping particles than that of the source. However, since\n\u03b4/\u03b1 \u2248 0.03, the difference is small. In order to reproduce\nthe observed Galactic CR spectrum sesc , the source spectrum should be s \u2248 sesc \u2248 2.2. Hence, the PS model requires s > 2 at the source. This condition is satisfied if\nwe consider the diffusive shock acceleration at moderate\nMach number (Fujita et al. 2009). It is also possible to derive s > 2 if we consider the effects of neutral particles\n(Ohira et al. 2009b,c).\nIn the case PH, because the value of \u03b4/\u03b1 is small, sesc\nalways near 2, which is the value predicted by the diffusive\nshock acceleration theory in the strong shock, test-particle\nlimit. In particular, if \u03b4 = 0 - indeed, even in the testparticle limit where the cooling via CR escape can be neglected, the value of \u03b4 is not exactly zero unless t \u226b tSedov\n(see Fig. 2) - then, one can find sesc = 2. This is what\nBerezhko & Krymsky (1998) and Ptuskin & Zirakashvili\n(2005) showed. Note that from Fig. 2, \u03b4 is negative for a\nlong time, so that sesc < 2. Therefore, this model PH cannot reproduce the observed Galactic CR spectrum at the\nEarth.\nIn the case TL, neglecting \u03b4, we obtain\nsesc \u2248 s +\n\n3\n(3 \u2212 slow ) .\n13\n\n(50)\n\nHence if slow < 3, then sesc > s. For the test particle acceleration, we have s = slow , so that the source spectrum\nshould be s \u2248 2.2 in order to obtain sesc = 2.4. For the\nnonlinear acceleration, one typically expects slow > 2 and\ns < 2, so that sesc \u2264 29/13 \u2248 2.23. Therefore, the nonlinear model seems to explain the inferred source spectrum\nmarginally. Possible rigorous determination of the value of\nsesc may give a constraint on the theory of nonlinear acceleration.\n\n\f8\n\nOhira et al.: Escape-limited Model of Cosmic-ray Acceleration Revisited\n\n5. Application to AGN Cocoon Shocks\nIn this section, taking account of a constraint derived\nfrom the spectrum at the Earth, we study the origin of CRs with energies larger than \u223c 1017.5 eV and\nthe acceleration mechanism of them at AGNs. There\nare many works which discuss UHECR production in\nAGNs (e.g., Biermann & Strittmatter 1987; Takahara\n1990; Rachen & Biermann 1993; Berezinsky et al. 2006;\nBerezhko 2008; Pe'er et al. 2009). Many of them focus on\nUHECR acceleration in radio galaxies including FanaroffRiley (FR) I and II galaxies, which typically have powerful\njets. In the context of DSA, one can basically suppose three\nacceleration zones; internal shocks in jets, hot spots, and\ncocoon shocks. The former two are most widely discussed\nscenarios but the detailed study of DSA at such mildly relativistic shocks has not yet been achieved. In this section,\nwe concentrate on the cocoon shock scenario proposed by\nBerezhko (2008), where the non-relativistic DSA theory can\nbe applied.\nIn this scenario, extragalactic CRs with energies larger\nthan the second knee (\u223c 1017.5 eV) may be accelerated\nat the outer cocoon shock running into the intergalactic\nmedium (IGM). As powerful jets penetrating into a uniform ambient medium with a density \u03c1am , the heads of the\ncocoon advances into the IGM with a velocity uh . At the\nsame time, the cocoon expands sideways with a velocity uc .\nSince the typical cocoon shock is non-relativistic, we apply\nthe escape-limited model considered in previous sections.\nAlthough we hereafter focus on this scenario, note that it\nis very uncertain whether the efficient acceleration occurs\nthere since observed non-thermal emission is much weaker\nthan that from hot spots and lobes.\nIn the following, we investigate whether the CR spectrum above the second knee can be explained by the AGN\ncocoon shock scenario with the same parameters for young\nSNRs explaining the CR spectrum below the knee, which\nhave been discussed in \u00a7 4. Similar to the previous calculations in \u00a7 4, we hereafter calculate the values of \u03b1\u0303 =\n(esc)\nd ln pm /d ln t and \u03b2\u0303 = d ln K/d ln t in order to derive the\nspectral index, sesc . Here we adopt \u03c7 = t, where \u03c7 is a\nvariable appeared in \u00a7 3.3.\nFirst, let us consider evolution of the maximum mo(esc)\nmentum, pm (t), in a phenomenological way. In the young\nSNR case (\u00a7 4.2), we have phenomenologically expected\n13\npm \u221d t\u2212 5 . Then, by using the Sedov-Taylor solution\n(ush \u221d t\u22123/5 and Rsh \u221d t2/5 ), we can easily obtain\n13+2c\n\nc\n3\nRsh\n,\np(esc)\nm (t) \u221d ush\n\n(51)\n\nwhere c is a phenomenologically introduced parameter since\n(esc)\nc\none can expect l \u221d Rsh\nin general. Note that pm \u221d Blush ,\nhowever, B does not depend on Rsh but on ush as long as B\nis generated by plasma instabilities such as CR streaming\ninstabilities. In the cocoon shock scenario, ush and Rsh are\nreplaced with uc and Rc , respectively.\n(esc)\nIn order to obtain the value of \u03b1\u0303 = d ln pm /d ln t, the\ndynamics of the AGN cocoon is necessary. A simple consideration of the cocoon dynamics for the constant density\nIGM tells us that uh is almost time-independent and uc\nevolves as uc \u221d t\u22121/2 (Begelman & Cioffi 1989), so that\nthe cocoon radius evolves as Rc \u221d uc t \u221d t1/2 and the jet\nradius evolves as Rh \u221d uh t \u221d t. Then, we obtain \u03b1\u0303 = 13\n6\nand \u03b1\u0303 = 2 for c = 0 and c = 1, respectively.\n\nNext, let us consider the time dependence of the normalization factor of the spectrum of accelerated CRs, K(t) \u221d\nt\u03b2\u0303 . The volume of the acceleration region swept by the cocoon shock is \u223c Auc t, where A is the total area of the\nshock surface. If we assume the elliptical shape of the cocoon2 , then A \u221d Rc uh t \u221d t3/2 , so that Auc t \u221d t2 . In the\ncases PS and PH, f0 (mp c) is related to PCR . The dependence of PCR is written as PCR \u221d \u03c1am u2c \u221d t\u22121 , where we\nneglect for simplicity the evolution of the acceleration efficiency which was considered in Berezhko (2008). Then, in\nthe case PS, f0 (mp c) \u221d PCR leads to\nK(t) \u221d (Auc t) \u00d7 f0 (mp c) \u221d t1 ,\n\n(52)\n\nwhile in the case PH, f0 (mp c) \u221d PCR t\u03b1\u0303(2\u2212s) leads to\nK(t) \u221d (Auc t) \u00d7 f0 (mp c) \u221d t1+\u03b1\u0303(2\u2212s) .\n\n(53)\n\nFinally, in the case of model TL (see \u00a7 4.4), f0 (mp c) \u221d\nlow \u22121\n\u03c1am psinj\nleads to\nK(t) \u221d (Auc t) \u00d7 f0 (mp c) \u221d t(5\u2212slow )/2 ,\n\n(54)\n\nwhere we assume the constant IGM density3 . Therefore, we\nobtain\n\u03b2\u0303 =\n\n(\n\n1\n(PS)\n1 + \u03b1\u0303(2 \u2212 s) (PH)\n(5 \u2212 slow )/2 (TL)\n\n.\n\n(55)\n\nBy using the above results, we can obtain the spectrum\nof escaping particles. Here, we assume \u03b1\u0303 = 2 expected for\nc = 1 (l \u221d Rc ). Then from Eq. (28), we derive\nsesc =\n\n(\n\ns + 1/2\n(PS)\n5/2\n(PH)\ns + (5 \u2212 slow )/4 (TL)\n\n.\n\n(56)\n\nInterestingly, all the three cases (PS, PH and TL) lead\nto the source spectral index sesc \u2248 2.4\u20132.7 which is required in the proton dip model and in the other extragalactic scenarios. In the case of model PS, s = 2.2 leads to\nsesc = s + 1/2 = 2.7. In the case of model PH, s < 2 leads\nto sesc = 2 + 1/2 = 2.5. Note that in this case, the value\nof sesc does not depend on s but on \u03b1\u0303 generally. Finally in\nthe case of model TL, s = slow = 2 (based on the test particle acceleration) leads to sesc = 2 + 3/4 = 2.75, which is\nalso consistent with the observed UHECR spectrum in the\nproton dip model unless the redshift evolution of UHECR\nsources are fast. If the effect of nonlinear acceleration is\nprominent, s < 2 and slow > 2 can give harder indices of\nsesc < 2.75.\n2\nBerezhko (2008) assumed a kind of spherical cocoon, i.e.,\nA \u221d Rc uc t, and used K(t) \u221d \u03c1am Rc3 which is similar to the\nrelation obtained in the case of model PS. However, when the\ncocoon becomes spherical, uc and uh evolve according to the\nadiabatic solution as in the Sedov-Taylor solution for SNRs\n(Begelman & Cioffi 1989; Fujita et al. 2007).\n3\nHowever, it may not be the case since the IGM density may\ndrop with the distance from the nucleus. Then we need to use\ndifferent adiabatic solutions for uc and Rc .\n\n\fOhira et al.: Escape-limited Model of Cosmic-ray Acceleration Revisited\n\n6. Summary and Discussions\nIn this paper, we have investigated the escape-limited\nmodel of CR acceleration, in which the maximum energy\nof CRs of an accelerator is limited by the escape from the\nacceleration site. The typical energy of escaping CRs decreases as the shock decelerates because the diffusion length\nbecomes longer. After revisiting the escape-limited model\nand reconsider its detail more generally, we have derived\na simple relation between the spectrum of escaping particles and one in the accelerator. Then, using the obtained\nrelation, we have discussed which model of injection is potentially suitable to make the Galactic and extragalactic\nCRs observed at the Earth.\nFor young SNRs, we have considered the shock evolution\nwith cooling by escaping CRs and those spectra for the\nthree injection models. As a result, we have found that in\nthe case PH, it is difficult to satisfy the condition for the\nsource spectrum of Galactic CRs (sesc \u2248 2.2\u20132.4). On the\nother hand, sesc \u2248 2.2\u20132.4 can be achieved in cases of PS\nand TL.\nWe have also applied our escape-limited model to AGN\ncocoon shocks as well as young SNRs. This model is just\none of the various candidates proposed so far, even if AGNs\nare UHECR accelerators. Nevertheless, it is interesting that\nthe young SNR and the AGN cocoon shock scenarios can\nexplain the Galactic and extragalactic cosmic rays observed\nat the Earth in the same picture for all the three injection\nmodels if we accept the proton-dip model inferring sesc \u2248\n2.4\u20132.7. Whether the proton dip model is real or not can\nalso be tested by future UHECR and high-energy neutrino\nobservations. In this paper, we have focused on the proton\ncase. Obviously, heavier nuclei become important above the\nknee so that we need to take into account them in order to\nexplain the CR spectrum over the whole energy range. We\ncan also apply the escape-limited model to heavy nuclei\nCRs for this purpose, although it is beyond the scope of\nthis paper.\nWe point out a potential problem for the magnetic field\namplification in the escape-limited model. In the case of\nyoung SNRs, we have determined the evolution of the maximum energy in the phenomenological way, and adopted\n10+2c\n\n\u03b1 \u2248 6.5. Using Eqs. (16) and (51), we obtain B \u221d ush 3 ,\nc\nwhere l \u221d Rsh\n. The same result is obtained for AGN cocoon shocks because we have considered the case in which\nthe same parameters describe both the young SNR shocks\nand the AGN cocoon shocks. In particular, for c = 1 as\nis used in Eq. (31), we obtain B 2 \u221d u8sh which means\nthat B rapidly decreases with radius (or time). In principle, both the dependence of B on ush and the value of c\ncan be determined theoretically, and then the evolution of\nthe maximum energy should be predicted. Some previous\nworks are based on theoretical arguments on the magnetic\nfield evolution (e.g., Bell 2004; Pelltier et al. 2006; Berezhko\n2008; Caprioli et al. 2009), which seem to be different from\nour phenomenological one. At present, the mechanisms of\nthe particle acceleration and the magnetic field amplification are still highly uncertain despite of many theoretical\nefforts (e.g., Niemiec et al. 2008; Riquelme & Spitkovsky\n2009; Ohira et al. 2009a; Luo & Melrose 2009). Hence, we\nexpect that further theoretical and observational studies\nmight reveal this discrepancy or exclude the possibility of\nescape-limited acceleration in the future.\n\n9\n\nIn this paper, we have mainly considered spectra of dispersed CRs around young SNRs and AGN cocoon shocks.\nHowever, applications to other astrophysical objects are,\nof course, possible. For example, the old SNRs detected\nby Fermi LAT, such as W28, W44, W51 and IC443\n(Abdo et al. 2009a,b) have been of great interest because\nthey likely generate escaping CRs. In fact, the number of\nCRs around such old SNRs is likely to decrease with time\nor the shock radius, that is \u03b2 < 0 while \u03b1 > 0. For example, when we consider the dynamics of an old SNR, we\n\u22122\nhave ush \u221d t\u22122/3 \u221d Rsh\n(e.g., Yamazaki et al. 2006), so\n\u22121\n2 3\nthat we have E \u221d us Rs \u221d Rsh\n, i.e., \u03b4 = \u22121 < 0. On\nthe other hand, the value of \u03b1 may be different from 6.5,\nwhich could be attributed to various complications such\nas the interaction with the dense molecular cloud, and so\non. For example, for the maximum hardening case, that\nis, sesc = s + (s \u2212 1)(\u03c3 \u22121 \u2212 1)/\u03b1 (see Appendix A.2), we\nfind sesc \u2248 1.5 when \u03b1 \u2248 1 and s \u2248 2.5 where we assume\ns = (\u03c3 + 2)/(\u03c3 \u2212 1). This might be the case for old SNRs\nsuch as W51C (Abdo et al. 2009b). In addition, the maximum energy may be rather small for the old SNRs, so that\n(esc)\nthe spectrum above pm would be suppressed. The spectrum of high-energy gamma rays might give us important\ninformation on both the acceleration and escape processes\nof CRs with energies much lower than the knee energy.\nAcknowledgements.
