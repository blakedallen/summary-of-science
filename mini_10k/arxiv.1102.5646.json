It was discovered (Stappers et al. 1996) as\npart of a Parkes all-sky survey of the southern sky for lowluminosity and millisecond pulsars. The pulsar has a spin period\nof 4.5 ms and inhabits a very compact circular orbit with a very low\nmass companion: mc < 0.1 M\u2299 . The orbital period is Pb = 2.38 h\nand the pulsar and its companion are separated by just 1.0 R\u2299 .\nStappers et al. (1996, 2001a) investigated the eclipse characteristics of this system and found that their duration is \u223c 10% of the\norbital period at frequencies below 1 GHz. In addition, assuming a\nmean free electron density of 107 cm\u22123 in the eclipse region, they\ncalculated a mass-loss rate of \u223c 10\u221214 M\u2299 yr\u22121 , which is insufficient to evaporate the companion completely within a Hubble time.\nOptical observations of the companion revealed that it is irradiated by the pulsar wind (Stappers et al. 1996). Further observations and modelling of the variability of the light curve\n(Stappers et al. 1999; Stappers et al. 2001b) determined a binary inclination angle of i \u223c 40\u25e6 , a backside temperature of T 6 3000 K,\n\na companion mass of \u223c 0.04 M\u2299 and a radius \u223c 0.064 R\u2299 . An\nalternative model with a companion almost filling its Roche lobe\n(\u223c 0.12 R\u2299 ) was also considered and produced almost the same\nresults, albeit with a significantly worse fit. For clarification purposes, a cartoon of the system is given in Figure 1.\nDoroshenko et al. (2001) presented the most precise timing\nanalysis of PSR J2051\u22120827 using \u223c 6 yr of radio timing measurements with the Effelsberg 100-m radio telescope and the 76-m\nLovell at Jodrell Bank. Among the most important measurements is\nthe variation of the projected semi-major axis, probably caused by\nNewtonian spin-orbit coupling in this binary system. In addition,\nthey measured significant orbital period variations and concluded\nthat those were created by the same mechanism as in the B1957+20\nsystem (Applegate & Shaham 1994; Arzoumanian et al. 1994): by\ntidal dissipation of a tidally powered, non-degenerate companion.\nBecause black widow (and other eclipsing) systems are susceptible to variations of their orbital parameters, monitoring over\nlong lengths of time is crucial to understand these systems. Timing of black widow pulsars has been undertaken by Nice et al.\n(2000) and Freire et al. (2003, 2005), but only very few of these\n\n\f2\n\nK.Lazaridis et al.\n\nsystems have been monitored for a decade or longer. This is of\nparticular interest given the large number of black widow pulsars\nrecently found in unidentified Fermi sources (Ransom et al. 2011;\nKeith et al. 2011, and several discoveries that are soon to be published).\nIn this paper we revisit PSR J2051\u22120827 with 13 years\nof high-precision timing data and combined datasets from the\nAustralia Telescope National Facility's Parkes 64-m radio telescope and the European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA) telescopes,\nconsisting of the 100-m Effelsberg radio-telescope of the MaxPlanck-Institute for Radioastronomy, Germany, the 76-m Lovell\nradio-telescope at Jodrell Bank observatory of the University of\nManchester, UK, the 94-m-equivalent Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) of ASTRON, the Netherlands, and the\n94-m-equivalent Nan\u00e7ay decimetric Radio Telescope (NRT) of\nthe CNRS, France. After describing the properties of our multitelescope data (Section 2), we present the updated measurements of the astrometric, spin and binary parameters for the system (Section 3). Specifically we show the measurement of the\ncombined proper motion and of the orbital eccentricity of the\nPSR J2051\u22120827 system for the first time and we measure the\ndispersion measure (DM) variations over time. Furthermore, we\npresent the extreme variations in the orbital period and projected\nsemi-major axis of the system, which are much larger than the\nones published by Doroshenko et al. (2001). In Section 4 we rule\nout several possible contributions to the aforementioned variations\nand we discuss the physical mechanisms possibly responsible for\nthose. Specifically, we show that gravitational quadrupole coupling\n(GQC) and classical spin-orbit coupling (SOC) can be viable mechanisms for the orbital variations of the PSR J2051\u22120827 system,\nunder certain assumptions. In light of the new orbital variation\nmeasurements, we discuss the possible scenarios for the nature of\nthe companion and the prospects for observations of the system at\nhigher energies, also in Section 4. Finally, in Section 5, we briefly\nsummarise our findings.\n\n2 OBSERVATIONS AND DATA ANALYSIS\nDescription of the observing systems and the data acquisition procedure of the EPTA telescopes can be found in Lazaridis et al.\n(2009), while for Parkes this information is given in Stappers et al.\n(1998). A detailed description on combining pulse times-of-arrival\n(TOAs) from different telescopes can be found in Janssen et al.\n(2008); Lazaridis et al. (2009); details specific to the data analysis\nused here, are listed below.\nIn our timing of PSR J2051\u22120827, all TOAs with uncertainties greater than 20 \u03bcs were excluded as they don't impact the\nweighted fit. Furthermore, 573 TOAs that were taken at orbital\nphases between 0.2 and 0.35 were not used because the potential\nexcess column density in the eclipsing region may cause additional\nmodulation on the TOAs derived from these data (Stappers et al.\n1998; Stappers et al. 2001a).\nTiming was performed with the T EMPO 2 software package\n(Hobbs et al. 2006), using the DE405 Solar-System ephemerides\nof the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (Standish 1998, 2004) and the\nELL1 binary model (Lange et al. 2001). T EMPO 2 minimises the\nweighted sum of the squared residuals, producing a set of improved\npulsar parameters and post-fit timing residuals. In order to propagate unmodelled noise through into the uncertainties of the timing model parameters, the TOA uncertainties were multiplied by\ntelescope-specific scaling factors to achieve a reduced \u03c72 of unity.\n\nFigure 2. Post-fit timing residuals for the last 4.5 years of data. Our timing\nsolution is given in Table 2. The majority of the data are from the Nan\u00e7ay\nradio observatory, but data from Effelsberg, Jodrell Bank and Parkes were\nalso used in the preceding nine years, which are not shown.\n\nThese scaling factors all fell between 1.4 and 3.5, where the largest\nfactor was applied to the TOAs of the Effelsberg-Berkeley-PulsarProcessor (EBPP). The large reduced \u03c72 for the EBPP data is most\nlikely caused by the fact that this instrument only records total\npower (no polarisation information) and has no RFI mitigation applied to it. Arbitrary phase offsets (also called \"jumps\") were introduced between data obtained at different frequencies and/or taken\nwith different telescopes, to account for frequency-dependent pulse\nshape evolution and observatory-dependent differences in instrumental delays, cable lengths and geodetic position, amongst others.\nThese jumps were included as free parameters in the least-squares\nfit performed by T EMPO 2 and they absorb any non-changing dispersive effects in our data. Therefore we were unable to evaluate the\naverage DM and hence fixed the value obtained by Stappers et al.\n(1998) as a constant in our timing model. However, the data does\ncontain some sensitivity to time-varying dispersive delays, which\nis fully discussed in Section 3.3.\nIn Table 1 the properties of the data from the different telescopes are presented. Combination of the TOAs from all the telescopes provides us with a 13-year dataset with no significant gaps.\nIn order to obtain a coherent timing solution for this combined\ndataset, higher order derivatives (up to sixth order) of the orbital\nperiod and projected semi-major axis must be fitted, leading to high\ncorrelations between the modelled parameters. These variations in\norbital period and size are discussed in detail in sections 4.1 and\n4.2. To avoid these correlations and because 85% of our data (and\nall of our highest-precision data) were taken after 2004, we derive\nthe timing model, presented in Table 2, based solely on the last\n4.5 years of data, between MJDs 53293 and 54888 (as shown in\nFigure 2). The remaining older data were exclusively used to investigate potential variations in interstellar dispersion (see Section 3.3)\nand to investigate possible causes for the variations in orbital period\nand projected semi-major axis (Section 3.5).\n\n\fQuadrupole variations in the J2051\u22120827 system\n\n3\n\nFigure 1. Illustration of the J2051-0827 system geometry. The pulsar and companion star are about one solar radius apart, the inclination angle of their orbit\nis approximately 40\u25e6 and the pulsar wind pushes the companion's wind out, resulting in a bow shock-like denser region of charged particles, which causes\nthe system to be eclipsed at given orbital phases and low observational frequencies. Changes in the oblateness of the tidally-locked companion star, possibly\nin combination with alterations in the direction of the spin axis \u03b8, trigger changes in the quadrupole moment that affect the timing of the pulsar. Notice this\nsketch is for illustrative purposes only and is not to scale.\n\nTable 1.

Using the NE2001 model for the Galactic distribution of\nfree electrons (Cordes & Lazio 2002) and the pulsar's dispersion\nmeasure (DM) of 20.745 cm\u22123 pc, a distance of d \u2243 1040 pc has\nbeen derived. Combining the latter with the composite proper motion, \u03bct = 7.3 \u00b1 0.4 mas yr\u22121 , the velocity of the system can be\ncalculated:\nvt = \u03bct d = 36.1 \u00b1 7.5 km s\u22121 ,\n\n(1)\n\nbeing consistent with previous estimates (Stappers et al. 1998). The\nlargest part of the error originates from the DM-derived distance\nwhere a 20% uncertainty was assumed.\n\nPSR J2051\u22120827 is in a low-eccentricity binary. A precise eccentricity measurement has been challenging in the past but from our\ntiming one has been made for the first time: e = (6.2\u00b11.3)\u00d710\u22125 .\nThis eccentricity value is much larger than expected for such a tight\nbinary system if plotted in an eccentricity versus orbital period diagram (as in Phinney 1992; Phinney & Kulkarni 1994). Although\nthe model curves do not extend to very low orbital periods, this\nstill constitutes evidence that the PSR J2051\u22120827 system at its\npresent evolutionary stage experiences processes that do not allow for perfect circularisation. These processes could very well\nbe density fluctuations in a convective envelope of the donor star\n(see Section 4.1.1). Hence the eccentricity of PSR J2051\u22120827\n(6.2 \u00d7 10\u22125 ) is much larger than the expected residual eccentricities (6 10\u22128 ) for binary millisecond pulsars with a similar orbital\nperiod (Lanza & Rodon\u00f2 2001).\n\n\f4\n\nK.Lazaridis et al.\n\nTable 2.

DM variations versus time, including the best-fit linear trend.\n\nphase while keeping the jumps between observing bands and observatories fixed. This did not result in significant trends at any\norbital phase, including egress or ingress1 . Since this experiment\nrequired a fit for DM over TOAs that were restricted to a small fraction of the binary phase, a simultaneous fit to standard orbital parameters was impossible. However, the wide frequency range available at any given orbital phase implies that even if orbital-phase\u2013\ndependent DM variations did occur, their effect on the TOAs could\nonly partially be absorbed by the orbital parameters, implying some\nresidual DM variations would still be visible. Simultaneous fitting\nfor DM and long-term effects (such as pulsar position and proper\nmotion, spin, spin-down and orbital derivatives \u1e56b and \u1e8b) over limited orbital-phase ranges did not affect the DM estimates or the\nother timing parameters, confirming that the long-period terms of\nthe timing model are not affected by any potential orbital-phase\u2013\ndependent variations in interstellar dispersion.\nIn addition to investigating the DM evolution as a function of\norbital phase, the DM variations were determined across the entire\ndata set. To this end, intervals with adequate multi-frequency data\nwere identified by hand and DM values were fitted in each interval,\nwhile jumps between telescopes and observing bands were kept\nfixed at the values determined from the entire data set. Clearly this\ncannot result in accurate measurements of DM, but it does allow\nvariations to be determined precisely. The resulting measurements\n(shown in Fig. 3) demonstrate that no complex DM evolution is\npresent in this data set, though a shallow DM decay is measured:\nd(DM)/dt = (\u22124.3 \u00b1 1.4)\u00d710\u22124 cm\u22123 yr\u22121 pc. This measurement is barely significant at the 3-\u03c3 level. Given the small number\nof high-quality DM estimates that contributed to it and the possible underestimation of the DM measurement uncertainties (e.g.\nvariations in orbital parameters could have affected the offset between non-simultaneous observations), we did not include a timedependent DM variation in our timing model.\n\n3.3 DM variations\n\n3.4 Companion mass\n\nAs described in Section 1, low-frequency observations of this system show eclipses as the pulsar passes through periastron. This may\nimply increased dispersion as a function of orbital phase, which\ncould corrupt measurements of binary parameters. To investigate\nthis possibility, we took the high-quality, multi-frequency data from\nthe final 4.5 years and measured the DM as a function of orbital\n\nOptical observations (Stappers et al. 2001b) yielded a best fit for\nthe orbital inclination angle of about 40\u25e6 . Depending on the un1\n\nThis does not contradict the increased column density in the eclipse region but underlines the limited sensitivity of our dataset to DM variations.\n\n\fQuadrupole variations in the J2051\u22120827 system\n\n5\n\nFigure 4.

The box indicates the most likely\nparameter space in terms of the neutron star mass and constraints from radio\neclipses and optical observations (see text).\n\nknown mass of the pulsar this results in a companion mass in the\nrange: mc \u2243 0.04 \u2212 0.06 M\u2299 (see Figure 4) given the constraints\nfrom the mass function:\nf=\n\n4\u03c0 2 (ap sin i)3\n(mc sin i)3\n=\n= 1.0030 \u00d7 10\u22125 M\u2299 , (2)\n(mp + mc )2\nG\nPb2\n\nwhere the measured observables are the orbital period, Pb and the\nprojected semi-major axis of the pulsar orbit, ap sin i. For the rest\nof this paper we shall assume a companion star mass of mc =\n0.05 M\u2299 and consequently a pulsar mass of mp = 1.8 M\u2299 . The\npulsar mass of PSR J2051\u22120827 is likely to be significantly larger\nthan the typical neutron star mass (1.35 M\u2299 ) obtained from measurements in double neutron star binaries, given that this system has\nevolved through a long (\u223c Gyr) LMXB phase with sub-Eddington\nmass transfer (see, e.g. Pfahl et al. 2002). Recent work on the mass\ndetermination of the original black widow pulsar (PSR B1957+20)\nby van Kerkwijk et al. (2011) confirms that the pulsars in these systems can accrete significant amounts of matter. For a discussion\nof the effect of irradiation on the accretion efficiency in LMXBs,\nsee Ritter (2008). The Roche-lobe radius of the companion star\nin PSR J2051\u22120827 changes slightly with the estimated stellar\nmasses and is found to be RL = 0.15 \u00b1 0.01 R\u2299 . However, the\nsize (radius) of the irradiated companion star is difficult to determine accurately and in the discussion further on we shall assume\ntwo different values for the filling factor (the ratio of the volumeequivalent radius of the companion star to its Roche lobe) of 0.43\nand 0.95 (Stappers et al. 2001b), corresponding to stellar radii of\nabout 0.064 R\u2299 and 0.14 R\u2299 respectively.\n3.5 Orbital changes\nIn order to monitor their variations over time, values for Pb and\nx were derived for each year of data, where three months of overlap were kept between adjacent years. In doing so, all model parameters besides x, Pb and TASC were held fixed and the timing\nreference epoch was defined to be the centre of each year-long interval. The fractional changes of these measurements are shown in\nFigure 5. Clearly, five different epochs can be identified, in which\nvariations of both Pb and x can be described using only a linear\ntrend, as shown in the figure.\n\nFigure 5. Changes of the orbital period (top) and projected semi-major axis\n(bottom) versus date. Each point corresponds to close to one year of data,\nwith typically three months overlap between adjacent points, though the\nprecise amount of overlap varies depending on the density of observations\nand the amplitude of the orbital variations. The horizontal bars indicate the\nintervals over which measurements were made, and the uncertainties of the\nmeasurements are shown by vertical error bars that are placed at the mean\nTOA of the data contained in the interval. Because of inhomogeneous sampling, the mean TOA is not necessarily at the middle of the interval. For\neach of the five epochs listed in Table 2 a trend line derived from the respective \u1e56b and \u1e8b measurements given in Table 2 is shown. In most cases\nthese trend lines fit well through the measurement points, though deviations\nmay be caused by rapid variations in orbital parameters, underestimation\nof measurement uncertainties, correlations between parameters and the fact\nthat on many of the shorter measurement intervals only part of the timing model could be fitted for, incurring potential corruptions in correlated\nparameters. The thick horizontal bars on the top of the figure indicate the\ntiming baseline of Doroshenko et al. (2001), which only really spans the\nfirst two of these epochs.\n\n4 DISCUSSION\n4.1 Orbital period variations\nP \u0307b is the observable rate of change of the orbital period and is\ncaused by a variety of effects, both intrinsic to the system and\n\n\f6\n\nK.Lazaridis et al.\n\ncaused by kinematic effects relative to the observer. The most important contributions are:\nGW\nD\n\u1e41\nT\nQ\nP \u0307b = P \u0307b\n+ P \u0307b + P \u0307b + P \u0307b + P \u0307b .\n\n(3)\n\nAs a point of reference, the values for \u1e56b in the two most extreme\nepochs are P \u0307b = \u22121.81(3) \u00d7 10\u221211 and P \u0307b = 1.8(3) \u00d7 10\u221211 .\nGW\nThe first term, P \u0307b\n, is the contribution due to gravitational\nwave emission. In general relativity, for circular orbits it is given\nby (Peters 1964):\n\u00135/3\n\u0012\nq\n192\u03c0 2\u03c0 Gmc\n,\n(4)\n\u1e56bGW = \u2212\n5\nPb c3\n(q + 1)1/3\nThe mass ratio q = 36 has been calculated assuming a pulsar\nmass mp = 1.8 M\u2299 and a companion mass mc = 0.05 M\u2299 for\nan inclination angle of i = 40\u25e6 . For PSR J2051\u22120827 we find\nGW\nP \u0307b\n\u2243 \u22127.5 \u00d7 10\u221214 . This value is about three orders of magnitude less than the observed value of P \u0307b .\nD\nThe second term, P \u0307b , is the Doppler correction, which\nis the combined effect of the proper motion of the system\n(Shklovskii 1970) and a correction term for the Galactic acceleration. The contribution for the Galactic acceleration at the loGal\ncation of PSR J2051\u22120827, P \u0307b , is of order 1.1 \u00d7 10\u221215\n(Lazaridis et al. 2009). Using numbers from Table 2, we also calculate the contribution due to the Shklovskii effect according to the\nfollowing:\nShk\n(\u03bc2 + \u03bc2\u03b4 )d\nP \u0307b\n= \u03b1\nPb \u2243 1.1 \u00d7 10\u221215 .\nc\nBy summing we yield the Doppler correction:\nShk\n\u1e56bD = \u1e56bGal + P \u0307b\n\u2243 2.2 \u00d7 10\u221215 ,\n\n(5)\n\n(6)\n\nfour orders of magnitude smaller than the measured value.\nAn acceleration of the binary system with respect to the Solar\nSystem Barycentre (SSB) could also be caused by a third massive\nbody orbiting the binary system. However, it would affect the orbital period derivative and the spin period derivative in the same\nway. Assuming that the spin period derivative is caused entirely\nby the acceleration, we can estimate the maximal effect this would\nhave on \u1e56b : (\u1e56b /Pb )acc = (\u1e56 /P ) \u2243 \u22123 \u00d7 10\u221218 s\u22121 . This is\nseven orders of magnitude smaller than the measured value, thus\nthere can be no massive third body orbiting the system.\n\u1e41\nThe third term, P \u0307b , is the contribution from the mass loss\nof the binary. If we consider a circular orbit, no mass loss from\nthe pulsar (\u1e41p = 0) and a rate of mass loss from the companion\n\u1e41c > 0 (Jeans 1924), we obtain:\n\u1e56b\n\u1e41c\n= \u22122\nPb\nM\n\n(7)\n\nand therefore:\n\u1e41c = \u2212\n\nM \u1e56b\n\u2243 6.2 \u00d7 10\u22128 M\u2299 yr\u22121 ,\n2 Pb\n\n(8)\n\nwhere M is the total mass of the system. This number is six orders\nof magnitude larger than expected (as calculated by Stappers et al.\n1996) and hard to reconcile with the low electron densities measured in the eclipse region (Stappers et al. 1996). In addition, for\nthe second of the epochs we would need mass injection to the companion in order to explain the orbital decay \u2013 an infeasible scenario\nfor this system.\nTidal forces in tight synchronous binaries may also be responsible for interactions which would change the orbital period. This\n\ncould be the case if, for example, a companion star suddenly contracts or expands and thereby changes its spin angular momentum.\nTidal locking of the orbit would then result in exchange of spin and\norbital angular momentum, e.g. Tauris & Savonije (2001). However, in PSR J2051\u22120827 we do not see reasons for any sudden\nmajor radial changes in the structure of the companion star \u2013 especially not changes that would not result in detection of X-ray bursts\n(A. Levine and D. Altamirano, private communication). Hence, we\nT\nneglect the term P \u0307b .\nSince all the above contributions are much smaller than the observed variation of the orbital period, we conclude that they must\noriginate from the last term of Equation (3), which represents variations of the gravitational quadrupole moment of the companion\nstar.\n\n4.1.1 The Applegate GQC model\nThe gravitational quadrupole coupling (GQC) mechanism\n(Applegate 1992; Applegate & Shaham 1994) has been applied\nsuccessfully to the eclipsing binary system PSR B1957+20\n(Applegate & Shaham 1994), explaining the orbital period variations seen by Arzoumanian et al. (1994). In addition, it was\nproposed by Doroshenko et al. (2001) as the main mechanism\nfor producing the orbital period variations of PSR J2051\u22120827.\nHowever, as we will present below, the latter publication considered only a small part of these variations, which led to an\nunderestimation in their calculations.\nIn the GQC model (Applegate & Shaham 1994), magnetic activity is driven by energy flows in convective layers of the irradiated companion. This, in combination with wind mass loss, results\nin a torque on its spin, which holds it slightly out of synchronous\nrotation, causing tidal dissipation of energy and heating of the companion. The resultant time-dependent gravitational quadrupole moment (e.g. variations of the oblateness) causes modulation of the\norbital period on a short, in principle dynamical, time scale. An\nincrease in the quadrupole moment causes the two stars to move\ncloser together and a decrease in the quadrupole moment results\nin a widening of the orbit \u2013 in Applegate's model total orbital angular momentum is assumed to remain constant and the neutron\nstar is treated as a point mass. The details of the hydrodynamic\ndynamo and its activity cycle remain unspecified for our purposes\n(also given the unknown nature of the companion star \u2013 see Section 4.4) and it is simply assumed that the variable quadrupole moment, \u2206Q, is caused by cyclic spin-up and spin-down of the outer\nlayers of the companion, which leads to orbital period changes\nequal to (Applegate & Shaham 1994):\n\u0012\n\u0013Q\n\u2206Pb\n\u2206Q\n,\n(9)\n= \u22129\nPb\nmc a2\nwhere a is the separation and mc the companion mass. The transfer\nof angular momentum \u2206J to a thin shell of radius Rc and mass Ms ,\nrotating with angular velocity \u03a9 in the gravitational field of a point\nmass mc , will cause the quadrupole moment of the shell to change\nby (Applegate & Shaham 1994):\n\u2206Q =\n\n2 Ms Rc5\n\u03a9 \u2206\u03a9 ,\n9 Gmc\n\n(10)\n\nwhere G is the Newtonian gravitational constant and \u2206\u03a9 is the\nchange in the angular velocity of the shell. In order to produce\norbital period changes \u2206Pb you need a variable angular velocity\ngiven by\n\n\fQuadrupole variations in the J2051\u22120827 system\nMs \u2206\u03a9\nGmc\n=\nmc \u03a9\n2Rc3\n\n\u0012\n\na\nRc\n\n\u00132 \u0012\n\nPb\n2\u03c0\n\n\u00132\n\n\u2206Pb\nPb\n\n(11)\n\n(Applegate & Shaham 1994). This procedure produces a luminosity variation \u2206L given by\nGm2c\n\n\u03c0\n\u2206L =\n3 Rc Pmod\n\n\u0012\n\na\nRc\n\n\u00132\n\n\u03a9dr \u2206Pb\n,\n\u03a9 Pb\n\n(12)\n\nwhere Pmod is the period of the orbital period modulation\nand \u03a9dr is the angular velocity of the differential rotation\n(Applegate & Shaham 1994).\nApplegate & Shaham (1994) assume in their model a mass\nMs \u2243 0.1mc for the thin shell; an angular velocity \u03a9dr \u2243 \u2206\u03a9;\nand luminosity variations at the \u2206L/L \u2243 0.1 level. From Figure 5 we calculated for PSR J2051\u22120827 a total change in the orbital period of \u2206Pb /Pb \u2243 2.2 \u00d7 10\u22127 and a modulation period of\nPmod \u2243 7.5 yr. As mentioned above these two values where underand over-estimated, respectively, in Doroshenko et al. (2001) because of their significantly smaller data set. By assuming an inclination angle of i = 40\u25e6 and a companion radius of Rc \u223c 0.064 R\u2299\n(Stappers et al. 2001b) for a separation a \u2243 7.1\u00d7108 m and a companion mass mc = 0.05 M\u2299 , we derive a variation of the angular\nvelocity of the companion of:\n\u2206\u03a9\n\u223c 4 \u00d7 10\u22122 .\n\u03a9\n\n(13)\n\nThis variation would produce a variable luminosity of \u2206L \u223c 1.4 \u00d7\n1033 erg s\u22121 and according to the model the internal luminosity of\nthe companion must be\nL \u223c 1.4 \u00d7 1034 erg s\u22121 .\n\n(14)\n\nFrom the optical observations of the companion (Stappers et al.\n2001b) we can estimate a maximum effective temperature of\nmax\nTeff\n\u2243 3000 K which gives an internal luminosity of L \u223c\n1030 erg s\u22121 . We therefore conclude that, under the assumptions\nlisted above, the GQC model produces much larger orbital period\nvariations than expected and cannot fit the PSR J2051\u22120827 system. If the companion was tidally powered, the internal luminosity\nderived from the optical observations would be much higher. One\nreason why GQC does not fit the observations may be the simplifications of the model itself, i.e. the consideration that all of the\nenergy variations appear as luminosity variations without any loss\n(Applegate 1992). Although improvement of the model could possibly decrease \u2206L by a factor of a few, the difference we calculate\nis significantly larger.\nThe previous calculations can change by a large factor if\nwe consider the alternative model that Stappers et al. (2001b) presented for the companion star, where the latter almost fills its Roche\nlobe (Rc = 0.14 R\u2299 ). Using the values for that model, we derive a\nvariation of the angular velocity of the companion of\n\u2206\u03a9\n\u223c 7.1 \u00d7 10\u22124\n\u03a9\n\n(15)\n\nand an internal luminosity of\nL \u223c 2 \u00d7 1031 erg s\u22121 .\n\n(16)\n\nThis number is much closer to the newly calculated internal luminosity from the optical of L \u223c 6 \u00d7 1030 erg s\u22121 . Thus, under\nspecific assumptions the GQC model can explain the orbital period\nvariations of PSR J2051\u22120827.\n\n7\n\n4.2 Changes in the projected semi-major axis\nThe observed values of \u1e8b can be the result of various effects\n(Lorimer & Kramer 2005):\n\u1e8bobs = \u1e8bGW + \u1e8bD +\n\nd\u01ebA\n+ \u1e8bPM + \u1e8b\u1e41 + \u1e8bQ + \u1e8bSOC .\ndt\n\n(17)\n\nFor the most extreme epochs, we have: \u1e8b = \u22127.9(8) \u00d7 10\u221213 and\n\u1e8b = 9(1) \u00d7 10\u221213 .\nThe first term, \u1e8bGW arises from orbital shrinkage due to\ngravitational-wave damping. Using Kepler's third law and Equation 4:\n\u1e8bGW\n2 \u1e56bGW\n=\n\u2243 \u22122.6 \u00d7 10\u221219\nx\n3 Pb\n\n(18)\n\n(Peters 1964). This contribution is much smaller than the current\nmeasurement.\nThe second term, \u1e8bD , is identical to the second term of Equation (3). The contribution for the Galactic acceleration is of order 1.1 \u00d7 10\u221215 and the contribution of the Shklovskii effect\n\u1e8bShk = x(\u03bc2\u03b1 + \u03bc2\u03b4 )d/c \u223c 6.0 \u00d7 10\u221221 . Both of these are very\nsmall compared to the observed value so this term can be neglected.\nThe third term, d\u01ebA /dt, is the contribution of the varying aberration caused by geodetic precession of the pulsar spin axis and is\ntypically of order \u03a9geod P/Pb \u2248 7.4 \u00d7 10\u221217 (Damour & Taylor\n1992). For a recycled pulsar, like PSR J2051\u22120827, the spin is\nexpected to be close to parallel to the orbital angular momentum,\nwhich further suppresses this effect. Hence, the contribution is at\nleast three orders of magnitude smaller than the observed value.\nThe fourth term, \u1e8bPM , represents a variation of x caused by a\nchange of the orbital inclination while the binary system is moving\nrelatively to the SSB (Arzoumanian et al. 1996; Kopeikin 1996).\nThis effect is quantified by the following equation:\n\u1e8bPM = 1.54 \u00d7 10\u221216 x cot i (\u2212\u03bc\u03b1 sin \u03a9asc + \u03bc\u03b4 cos \u03a9asc ), (19)\nwhere \u03a9asc is the position angle of the ascending node. The quantities x, \u03bc\u03b1 and \u03bc\u03b4 are expressed in seconds and milliarcseconds per\nyear, respectively. The maximal contribution of the proper motion\nis:\n\u221216\n\u1e8bPM\nx (\u03bc2\u03b1 + \u03bc2\u03b4 )1/2 cot i.\nmax = 1.54 \u00d7 10\n\n(20)\n\n\u221217\nFor an inclination angle of i = 40\u25e6 , we get \u1e8bPM\n.\nmax \u2243 6.0 \u00d7 10\nThus, this term is also very small compared to the measured \u1e8b.\nThe fifth term, \u1e8b\u1e41 , represents a change in the size of the orbit\ncaused by mass loss from the binary system. Using Equation (7)\nand Kepler's third law, we calculate the rate of mass loss from the\ncompanion to be seven to eight orders of magnitude larger than\nexpected.\nThe sixth term, \u1e8bQ , is caused directly by the change in\nquadrupole moment as described in Section 4.1. Because orbital\nangular momentum is conserved in the Applegate model, a change\nin the orbital period is related to a change in the size of the orbit by\n\n\u2206a\n\u2206Pb\n=2\n.\na\nPb\n\n(21)\n\nIt can be seen from Figure 5 that this contribution falls short by\nfour orders of magnitude to explain the observed changes in the\nprojected semi-major axis x.\nAs all other contributions are much smaller than the observed\nvariation of the projected semi-major axis, they must originate from\nthe last term of Equation (17): the classical spin-orbit coupling\n(SOC) term.\n\n\f8\n\nK.Lazaridis et al.\n\nTable 3.

This in\nturn causes a variation of the longitude of periastron (which is impossible to measure in a system with such small eccentricity) and\nof the projected semi-major axis, according to:\n\u1e8bSOC = x nb Q\u0303 cot i sin \u03b8 cos \u03b8 sin \u03a6,\n\n(22)\n\n(Smarr & Blandford 1976; Wex 1998), where nb = 2\u03c0/Pb is the\norbital frequency, \u03b8 is the angle between the spin and orbital angular momentum and \u03a6 is the longitude of the ascending node with\nrespect to the invariable plane (plane perpendicular to the total angular momentum). The dimensionless quadrupole Q\u0303 is related to\nthe quadrupole Q by\n\u0012 \u00132\n3\nRc\n3Q\nQ\u0303 = J2\n,\n(23)\n, J2 =\n2\na\nmc Rc2\nwith J2 the dimensionless measure of the quadrupole moment.\nSince no uniform change in x is detected, we can consider the\ncompanion to consist of a long-term stable component with spin\naxis aligned to the orbital angular momentum axis (i.e. \u03b8 \u2248 0) and\nin addition to that, a part of the star (like e.g. an outer shell) that\nchanges its quadrupole moment by \u2206Q\u0303 and has an effective and\nvariable angle \u03b8 independent of the rest of the star. This part will\nthen give rise to a variation \u1e8b/x of the order nb \u2206Q\u0303.\nIn Section 4.1.1 we have described how changes in the gravitational quadrupole moment of the companion could cause the observed Pb variations. Even though these direct GQC effects are insufficient to explain the x variations (i.e. \u1e8bQ = 0 as explained\nabove), through the SOC mechanism they might have a more substantial effect.\nExtending Equation 9 to arbitrary \u03b8 and using Equation 23, we\nhave:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2206Pb\n3\n= \u22122\u2206Q\u0303 1 \u2212 sin2 \u03b8 .\n(24)\nPb\n2\nCombining this with the observed \u1e56b values (Table 2) and assuming \u03b8 = 0 for now, we get the maximum \u2206Q\u0303 values presented in\nTable 3. Comparison to the \u1e8b/x values from Figure 5, also listed\nin Table 3, shows that while the order of magnitude is rougly correct, the sign does neither correlate nor anti-correlate, which means\nthat the orientation of the quadrupole-moment changes (i.e. \u03b8) must\nvary strongly from epoch to epoch, which may be unphysical.\nIn order to examine more closely if the orbital variations can\nbe produced by GQC and SOC arising from the same \u2206Q, we have\nplotted in Figure 6 how |\u2206Q\u0303| depends on \u03b8, assuming \u03a6 = 45\u25e6\nand using i = 40\u25e6 . The curves are plotted for SOC, as derived\nfrom Equation 22, and for GQC, as derived from Equation 24. The\nintersection of the two lines clearly shows that for several values of\n\nFigure 6. Quadrupole moment changes versus \u03b8 as produced by SOC (solid\nline) and GQC (dashed line) for epochs two (top) and three (bottom).\n\n\u03b8 a \u2206Q\u0303 could explain both the orbital period and projected semimajor axis variations for PSR J2051\u22120827, though these \u03b8 values\nchange significantly with epoch and we do not see how this easily\nfits with the physical mechanism behind the thin shell model of\nApplegate (1992) (see also our Section 4.1.1).\n\n4.2.2 Spin precession of the companion star\nIn Section 4.2.1 we assumed a mostly stable companion star with\nan outer shell responsible for the changing quadrupole moment.\nAn alternative explanation for the variations in Pb and x could be\nprovided by limited quadrupole changes (as needed for the Pb varations, see Section 4.1.1) combined with an overall small tilt \u03b8 of\nthe entire companion star with respect to the orbit. This tilt causes\na precession of both the star and the orbit and it allows the entire\nquadrupole moment of the star Q\u0303 to cause variations in x according\nto Equation 22. We stress that in this scenario there need not be a\nphysical mechanism relating the spin precession (which causes the\n\n\fQuadrupole variations in the J2051\u22120827 system\nTable 4. Quadrupole changes (orientation and magnitude) that explain the\nchanges in Pb and x for the five epochs.\nEpoch\n\n\u03b8 (deg)\n\n\u2206Q/Q\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\n\u22120.14\n\u22120.64\n+0.73\n\u22120.06\n+0.02\n\n+0.041\n\u22120.017\n\u22120.041\n+0.052\n\u22120.019\n\nx variations) to the quadrupole moment changes (that induce the\nPb changes)2 .\nTo evaluate this model, we estimate the quadrupole moment\nof the companion star assuming a non-degenerate structure3 and\nfollowing Lanza & Rodon\u00f2 (1999):\n3\n\nQ=\n\n5 R [T \u2212 (1 \u2212 3\u03b7)M]\n6\u03be\nGM\n\n(25)\n\nwhere R and M are the radius and mass of the star, T is its rotational kinetic energy (T = I\u03a92 /2), M is its total magnetic energy,\n\u03b7 is the fraction of this magnetic energy in a field directed along the\nrotation axis and \u03be is a dimensionless parameter depending on the\ndensity stratification and the spatial distribution of the perturbing\nforces in the convective layer of the star (it can be calculated from\nthe gyration radius and the apsidal motion constant using stellar\nmodels). Here we shall use \u03be \u2243 5. The rotational frequency of the\nouter layers of the star is taken to be that of the orbit (caused by\nsynchronisation) and in Applegate's model M = 0. Adopting a\ncompanion star radius R = 0.064 R\u2299 yields:\nQ = 3.4 \u00d7 1047 g cm2 .\nConsequently, the quadrupole moment Q of the star is one to two\norders of magnitude larger than the variations required for the observed Pb changes. Using this value in Equation 22 results in the\nangles \u03b8 required for the observed x variations. These values can\nin turn be used to correct the \u2206Q values shown in Table 3 for the\nangular dependence, though this effect is all but negligible. The resulting changes required in the tilt and quadrupole moment of the\ncompanion star are collated in Table 4.\nWe conclude that with small changes in the orientation and\nmagnitude of the quadrupole moment, we can explain all observed\nparameter changes. The change in the sign of \u1e8b from one epoch to\nthe other can be easily explained by a small oscillation of the symmetry axis of the quadrupole. Moreover, if we use an alternative\nscenario with a larger filling factor for the radius of the companion star, these numbers will get even smaller since Q will be larger.\nWe do not, however, know of any physical mechanism that would\ncause the required tilt of the star or its rapid changes.\n\n2\n\nNote the changes in \u03b8 will have some contribution to the Pb changes as\nwell. Based on Equation 5 of Applegate (1992) we determined this effect\nand for all epochs save the third, this effect is at or well below the few\npercent level of the Pb changes induced by \u2206Q. In the third epoch, which\nrequires the largest angle \u03b8, it contributes 1% of the observed Pb variations.\n3 Deviations of a semi-degenerate nature should not be important in this\ncase.\n\n9\n\n4.3 Alternative Models for the Gravitational\nQuadrupole-Moment Variations\nThe Applegate model is one of a number that have been applied to\nexplain the cyclic modulation in the orbital period of magnetically\nactive close binaries. In Applegate's model a rather large fraction\nof the stellar luminosity is required for its operation. Hence, one\nmight be able to detect changes in the stellar luminosity in phase\nwith the orbital period modulation. The model of Lanza & Rodon\u00f3\n(e.g. Lanza et al. 1998; Lanza & Rodon\u00f2 1999) considers variations in the azimuthal B-field to explain the variations in oblateness. A change in the azimuthal field intensity can also produce a\nchange in the quadrupole moment by changing the effective centrifugal acceleration. However, one should keep in mind that it remains to be established what kind of companion star we have in\nPSR J2051\u22120827.\n\n4.4 The Nature of the Companion Star\nThere seem to be three possibilities for the nature of the companion\nstar:\nI a white dwarf (WD),\nII a brown-dwarf\u2013like star and\nIII a semi-degenerate helium star (He).\nIn the following we briefly discuss each of these possibilities.\nFor a WD companion star of Mc > 0.04 M\u2299 , the massradius relation of a non-relativistic degenerate Fermi-gas (e.g.\nShapiro & Teukolsky 1983) yields an upper limit for the radius of\nRc 6 0.025 R\u2299 . This value is much less than what is estimated\nin optical since a combination of the minimum value for the filling\nfactor of 0.43 and the Roche-lobe size of RL = 0.15 R\u2299 , yields\na minimum optical radius of Rc > 0.064 R\u2299 . However, because\nof irradiation by the pulsar wind and tidal dissipation of energy in\nthe WD envelope it is likely that the WD is bloated in size. The\neffect of a thermally bloated WD in a close binary system has recently been detected in a transiting source by the Kepler satellite\n(Carter et al. 2011). In this case the young (few hundred Myr) hot\nwhite dwarf is bloated by a factor of seven in size. The companion\nstar in PSR J2051\u22120827 is believed to be much older, however it is\nquite possible that an extended H-rich atmosphere may exist in this\nstar from the effects mentioned above. On the other hand, the actual\neffect of the pulsar wind remains uncertain and may not be as efficient as expected previously. For example, Equation (2) of Tavani\n(1992) for the irradiation of the companion as induced by the pulsar wind, yields a surface temperature of the companion of 6200 K.\nHowever, the observed temperature is 6 3000 K (Stappers et al.\n2001b).\nBrown\ndwarf\nmodels\nhave\nbeen\napplied\n(Bildsten & Chakrabarty 2001) to explain the nature of the\n\u223c 0.05 M\u2299 donor star in the accreting millisecond pulsar system\nSAX J1808.4-3658. Brown dwarfs have a relation between mass\nand radius that is acceptable from observational constraints, also\nfor PSR J2051\u22120827. However, the obtained mass-radius relation\nwas based on brown-dwarf models by Chabrier et al. (2000),\ncalculated for isolated low-mass stars. We find it questionable\nif the present core remnant in PSR J2051\u22120827 can simply be\ndescribed by the equivalent of a brown dwarf. The original ZAMS\nprogenitor system of PSR J2051\u22120827 definitely did not consist\nof a B-star and a brown dwarf: the initial sub-stellar mass of a\nbrown dwarf is < 0.08 M\u2299 (the limit for H-ignition) and the\nprogenitor of the neutron star had a mass > 10 M\u2299 . Hence, the\n\n\f10\n\nK.Lazaridis et al.\n\ninitial binary would have had a mass ratio of < 1/100, which is\nnot only disfavoured by formation, but also unlikely given that\nthis binary should undergo a common envelope phase followed\nby survival of a supernova explosion and finally spin up the\npulsar with so little mass. A more reasonable possibility is that\nPSR J2051\u22120827 (and many other eclipsing binary millisecond\npulsars) is the outcome of a short orbital period, low-mass X-ray\nbinary with un-evolved main sequence stars. Such systems have\nbeen studied in detail by, e.g., Pylyser & Savonije (1988) and\nErgma et al. (1997). The latter authors also discussed the final fate\nof a system like PSR J2051\u22120827: an ultra-compact LMXB where\nthe companion fills its Roche lobe (again), because of orbital\nangular momentum losses, and eventually may undergo tidal\ndisruption leaving behind a single or planetary millisecond pulsar\n(e.g. a system like PSR B1257+12, Wolszczan & Frail 1992).\nFinally, it should be noted that the companion star in\nPSR J2051\u22120827 could be closely related to the semi-degenerate\nhelium star companions in ultra-compact AM CVn systems (e.g.\nIben & Tutukov 1991; Nelemans et al. 2001). One example is the\nsystem SDSS J0926+3624 (Copperwheat et al. 2010) which has a\nsimilar companion mass of 0.035 M\u2299 (Pb = 28 min). Although\nthe accreting compact object in AM CVn systems is a WD, a similar evolution is expected for systems with an accreting neutron star\n(Savonije et al. 1986). Also, in this case the expected mass-radius\nrelations yield acceptable values for the radius in PSR J2051\u22120827\n\u2013 especially if one accepts the possibility that a pulsar wind and\ntidal dissipation could lead to a somewhat bloated radius.\n4.5 High-Energy Emission Prospects for PSR J2051\u22120827\nThe detection of X-rays from PSR J2051\u22120827 could yield vital\ninformation about its orbital evolution, the state of the companion star and interactions between the pulsar wind and the evaporated material of the companion star. However, no X-rays are detected from PSR J2051\u22120827 in the RXTE All-Sky-Survey (A.M.\nLevine, private communication). The RXTE ASM sensitivity in\nthe 2-10 keV band is \u223c 30 mCrab, corresponding to an energy\nflux of Fx \u2243 7 \u00d7 10\u221210 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 . Given the distance to\nPSR J2051\u22120827 (d \u2243 1.04 kpc), we can estimate an upper limit\nto the mass accretion rate:\n\u1e41 6\n\n4\u03c0 d2 Fx Rp\nG mp\n\n(26)\n\nAssuming a neutron star mass mp = 1.8 M\u2299 and radius Rp =\n106 cm, we obtain a conservative upper limit for the potential accretion rate \u1e41 . 6.0 \u00d7 10\u221212 M\u2299 yr\u22121 . Keeping in mind that the\nexpected mass transfer rate for a Roche-lobe-filling \u223c 0.05 M\u2299\ncompanion star is expected to be much lower than this limit \u2013 and\ngiven the fact that we do observe a radio pulsar \u2013 it is not a surprise that PSR J2051\u22120827 is not detected in the RXTE ASM data.\nChandra and/or XMM data would impose far more stringent constraints; or might even provide a detection.\nOne must bear in mind that the lack of detected X-rays does\nnot exclude mass loss from the companion star. It is possible that\nthe pulsar wind (which is probably enhanced in the equatorial region towards the companion star) is able to prevent any accretion\nonto the neutron star. However, in this scenario it needs to be investigated thoroughly whether or not a shock front would lead to\nacceleration of protons and subsequent production of high-energy\n\u03b3-rays (Harding & Gaisser 1990; Stappers et al. 2003).\nConsidering \u03b3-ray emission from this system, with a distance\nof \u2243 1.04 kpc and a spin-down luminosity \u0116 = 4\u03c0 2 I \u1e56 /P 3 =\n\n5.5 \u00d7 1033 erg/s, this pulsar is a good candidate for detection with\nthe Large Area Telescope of the Fermi satellite (Abdo et al. 2009).\nHowever none of the Fermi sources in the first-year catalogue lie\nwithin a radius of 3\u25e6 of PSR J2051\u22120827 (Abdo et al. 2010). It\nwould therefore be interesting to see if PSR J2051\u22120827 is detected by Fermi with accumulated data.\n\n5 SUMMARY\nWe have presented a timing update on PSR J2051\u22120827 and shown\nthat the variations of the orbital period and projected semi-major\naxis of the binary system are far more extreme than described in\nearlier work. We have analysed all possible causes for these variations and found that a combination of gravitational quadrupole\ncoupling and spin-orbit coupling are the most likely origins of this\nbehaviour, though accurate modelling efforts are still required. We\nfurthermore discussed the nature of the companion star and conclude that a semi-degenerate helium star is more likely than the\nwhite-dwarf alternative and, finally, we expect high-energy \u03b3-rays\nmay be visible in this system if a pulsar wind prevents accretion\nonto the neutron star \u2013 which in turn is expected based on the lack\nof X-rays.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe are very grateful to all staff at the Effelsberg, Westerbork, Jodrell Bank and Nan\u00e7ay radio telescopes for their help with the observations used in this work.
