The exchange interaction J in\na Mott insulator is roughly given by \u22122t2 /Eg , where t is\nthe transfer integral between the two localized orbitals\nand Eg is the excitation energy across the Mott gap.\nIn Mott insulators on frustrated lattices, spin-disordered\nsystems including organic and inorganic materials [2\u20136]\nall have relatively small Eg , suggesting that the smallness\nof Eg or the closeness to the Mott transition would be\nimportant to realize the spin-disordered ground states.\nVarious insulating transition-metal oxides are known\nas Mott insulators and can be classified into (i) the\nMott-Hubbard type insulators where the Mott gap Eg\nis mainly determined by the Coulomb interaction U between the transition-metal d electrons and (ii) the chargetransfer type insulators where Eg is determined by the\ncharge-transfer energy \u2206 from the oxygen p state to the\ntransition-metal d state [7]. Therefore, the smallness of\nEg can be obtained in transition-metal oxides with small\nU or small \u2206. In the small U case, theoretical studies on triangular-lattice Hubbard models proved that a\nspin-disordered phase is realized near the Mott transition [8\u201311], which could be related to the higher order\nexchange terms.

In\nthis material, there is a network of MnO6 octahedrons\nand Fig. 1 shows the definitions of interactions in the\nnearest-neighbor J1 , the second nearest-neighbor J2 , the\n\n\f2\nthird nearest-neighbor J3 , and the fourth nearest neighbor J4 . The exchange interaction J2 between second\nneighbor sites could be derived from the Mn-O-O-Mn\nexchange pathways which becomes important in small \u2206\nsystems. The values of these interactions were studied\nboth theoretically [13] and experimentally by inelastic\nneutron scattering [14]. In these studies, only J1 and J2\nare considered by assuming that the values of J3 and J4\nare small enough to be neglected. However, since the exchange interaction J3 between the third neighbor sites is\nalso derived from the Mn-O-O-Mn exchange pathways, it\nis not a trivial question whether J3 is negligible compared\nto J2 or not. In this context, it is very interesting and\nimportant to study the electronic structure of the Mn\noxide, especially the values of interactions J1 - J4 , using spectroscopic methods and to reveal the origin of the\nspin-disordered state from the electronic structural viewpoint. In this paper, we investigated the electronic structure of this material by x-ray absorption spectroscopy\n(XAS), and also estimated the values of magnetic interactions. Unrestricted Hartree-Fock calculations and a\nperturbation method revealed that the nearest neighbor\nand fourth nearest neighbor J1 and J4 are positive (antiferromagnetic), and the next nearest neighbor and third\nnearest neighbor J2 and J3 are negative (ferromagnetic).\nIn the present analysis, the ferromagnetic J2 does not\nintroduce magnetic frustration in the honeycomb lattice.\nWe conclude that the ferromagnetic J3 is the origin of\nmagnetic frustration and the absence of long-range ordering in this material.\nThe synthesis of Bi3 Mn4 O12 (NO3 ) polycrystalline\npowder is described in Ref. [12]. X-ray absorption experiments were performed at 11ID-1 (SGM) of the Canadian Light Source. The spectra were measured in the\ntotal-electron-yield (TEY) mode. The total energy resolution was set to 100 meV. All the spectra were measured\nat room temperature. The obtained spectrum is analyzed by standard cluster-model calculations [15] to obtain electronic parameters. The parameters in this model\nare 3d - 3d and 3d - 2p Coulomb interactions (Udd and\nUdc , respectively), charge-transfer energy from O 2p to\nMn 3d states \u2206, hopping integrals between Mn 3d and\nO 2p molecular states [V (t2g ) and V (eg )], and crystal\nfield parameter 10Dq. The superexchange interactions\nare evaluated using unrestricted Hartree-Fock calculation\nwith a multi-band d \u2212 p Hamiltonian with Mn 3d and O\n2p states [16].

The transfer integrals between the Mn 3d and O\npd\n2p orbitals Vk,lm\nare given in terms of Slater-Koster parameters (pd\u03c3) and (pd\u03c0). The parameters determined\nby the cluster-model calculation are used as input of the\nunrestricted Hartree-Fock analysis.\nFigure 2 shows the Mn 2p XAS spectrum of\nBi3 Mn4 O12 (NO3 ). There are two structures, Mn 2p3/2\n\u2192 3d absorption at 640 - 650 eV and Mn 2p1/2 \u2192 3d\nabsorption at 650 - 660 eV. The experimental spectrum\nhas a sharp peak at \u223c 641.5 eV characteristic of Mn4+ ,\nconcluded by comparing with the reference data of Mn2+\n(MnO), Mn3+ (LaMnO3 ), and Mn4+ (EuCo0.5 Mn0.5 O3\nand SrMnO3 ) from Ref. [17]. This indicates that the valence of Mn is 4+ in Bi3 Mn4 O12 (NO3 ), consistent with\n4+ 2\u2212\n\u2212\nthe valance state of Bi3+\nobtained in\n3 Mn4 O12 (NO3 )\nRef. [12]. We performed configuration-interaction (CI)\ncluster-model calculations [15] to obtain electronic parameters. Here we fixed the following values Udd = 6.0\neV, Udc = 7.5 eV, V (eg ) = 3.0 eV, and 10Dq = 1.3 eV\nand changed the value of \u2206 from 0.0 eV to 4.0 eV, as\nshown in Fig. 2 (a). The calculated spectra do not depend on the value of \u2206 so much, but the small \u2206 values of\n1.0 \u00b1 1.0 eV reproduce the experiment most successfully\nfrom a peak at \u223c 641.5 eV and Mn 2p1/2 structures.\n\n\f3\nMn 2p\n2p3/2\n\nfor Mn4+ specifically \u2206 = \u01ebd \u2212 \u01ebp + 3U .\n\nBi3Mn3O12(NO3)\n2p1/2\n\nIntensity (arb. units)\n\nExperiment\nTEY\nCI theory\nD = 0.0 eV\n\nD = 1.0 eV\nD = 2.0 eV\nD = 4.0 eV\n635\n\n640\n\n645\n\n650\n\n655\n\n660\n\n665\n\nPhoton Energy (eV)\n\nFIG. 2:\n(Color online):\nMn 2p XAS spectra of\nBi3 Mn4 O12 (NO3 ) and comparison with the CI theory.\n\nMn 3d\neg\n\nIntensity (arb. units)\n\neg\n\nBi 6p\n\nBi3Mn3O12(NO3)\n\nWith this parameter set, the lowest energy state is\nfound to be the conventional antiferromagnetic state\nwhere the first neighboring sites are antiferromagnetically coupled.

We have calculated energies of ferromagnetic state as well as modified antiferromagnetic\nstates which are obtained by exchanging spins of some\nneighboring sites in the ground state. As expected, the\nferromagnetic state is very much higher in energy than\nthe antiferromagnetic ground state.

There is a\nhigher intensity at eg\u2193 states in the experiment than in\nthe calculation, indicating that there is a substantial Bi\n6p contribution also in this structure. These assignments\nare consistent with the Mn4+ (d3 ) state, where majorityspin t2g states are occupied by electrons.\nIn order to obtain the values of magnetic interactions,\nwe have performed unrestricted Hartree-Fock analysis on\nthe multiband d \u2212 p Hamiltonian with the Mn 3d and O\n2p orbitals. \u2206, U , and (pd\u03c3) were set to be 1.0, 6.0, and\n\u22121.8 eV, respectively, on the basis of the cluster model\nanalysis. The ratio (pd\u03c3)/(pd\u03c0) is \u22122.16. Remaining\ntransfer integrals expressed by (pp\u03c3), (pp\u03c0), (dd\u03c3), and\n(dd\u03c0) are fixed at \u22120.6, 0.15, \u22120.3, and 0.15 eV, respectively, for the honeycomb lattice with the regular MnO6\noctahedron. Here \u2206 denotes the charge-transfer energy\n\nWhile the antiferromagnetic J1 and ferromagnetic J2 ,\nand antiferromagnetic J4 are consistent with the antiferromagnetic ground state, the ferromagnetic J3 can introduce frustration effect on it. Since the magnitude of the\nferromagnetic J3 is comparable to those of the antiferromagnetic J1 and ferromagnetic J2 , the ferromagnetic J3\nby the Mn-O-O-Mn superexchange pathways is responsible for the absence of long-range ordering in the present\nhoneycomb system.\n\nLet us also examine the sign of J3 by considering superexchange pathways in Bi3 Mn4 O12 (NO3 ) using a perturbation method based on the electronic structure parameters obtained from the analysis of the Mn 2p XAS\nspectrum. Here, we will use Slater-Koster parameters,\n(pp\u03c3), (pd\u03c3), (dd\u03c3), and so on [18].\n\n\f4\nJ3 is given as\nHere we considered the molecular orbitals made from two\noxygen sites.
