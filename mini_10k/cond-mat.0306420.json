Furthermore, since the excitation to the unperturbed continuum vanishes, the cross section expected from Fano's configuration interaction theory is identically\nzero. This shortcoming is removed by the explicit introduction of the phase shifted continuum,\nwhich demonstrates that the shape of a resonance, by itself, provides no information about the\nrelative excitation amplitudes to the discrete state and the continuum.\n\nQuantum interference occurs whenever there exist two\ncoherent paths from an initial state to a final state. Particularly fascinating is the case in which one of the two\npaths is via a resonance, for in this case the presence\nof the resonance is manifested in a wide variety of lineshapes. In the case of optical absorption they are often\ntermed Fano lineshapes [1]. One of the earliest examples\noccurred in the absorption spectrum of Ar, Kr, and Xe\n[2]. Above the first ionization limit the rare gas atoms can\nbe photoionized either directly or via the doubly excited\nstates, which are coupled to the ionization continuum.\nThe absorption cross section due to the doubly excited\nstates does not simply add to the continuum photoionization cross section, as might be naively expected for a\nBreit-Wigner resonance [3]. Rather, the amplitudes for\nexcitation of the doubly excited state and the continuum\nmust be added, often leading to asymmetric resonances.\nSuch asymmetric resonances are ubiquitous in the photoionization of atoms and molecules [4], and their existence prompted Fano to develop his seminal theory of\nconfiguration interaction between a discrete state and a\ncontinuum.\nAs it becomes possible to preserve quantum mechanical coherence in more complex systems, it is likely that\nFano's theory will find increasingly wide application. For\nexample, photoabsorption in quantum well systems exhibits interference which is essentially identical to that\nobserved in atomic photoionization [5,6]. Somewhat different manifestations occur in the conductance through\nmagnetic impurity atoms [7] and single electron transistors [8]. Extensions of Fano's theory have been worked\nout for these problems [9] and for its application to\nchaotic systems [10].\nHere we report an experiment which reveals a shortcoming of the straightforward application of Fano's theory. In particular we describe a photoionization experiment in which the excitation amplitudes to a series of\ndiscrete states vanish, yet we see symmetric peaks at\n\ntheir locations, not the commonly expected window resonances, or dips, in the photoionization cross section.\nMore problematic, the excitation amplitude to the unperturbed continuum also vanishes, leading the theory\nto predict no excitation at all. In fact, the theory is not\ncompletely correct for long range coulomb potentials and\nthus fails to describe photoionization. In the sections\nwhich follow we describe our experiment, review Fano's\ntheory, point out the source of the problem, and suggest\nthe correct form for the photoionization cross section.\n\n5f\u03b5l\n\n5g\u03b5l'\n\n5gnl'\n5fnl\n\n\u03bb5~550nm\n\n5d5/2nl\n\n\u03bb4=347nm\n\n5p3/2nl\n\u03bb3=408nm\n\nSr+\n5snl\n\n\u03bb2~417nm\n\n5s5p\n\u03bb1=461nm\n\n5s2\n\nFIG. 1. Excitation scheme of the experiment. The excitation of the Sr5d17l state is done with four fixed frequency\nlasers and Stark switching. The frequency of the final fifth\nlaser is swept through the energy from the Sr + 5f to 5g limits. As shown, there is no excitation amplitude to the 5gnl\u2032\nstates, only to the 5f \u01ebl continuum.\n\nIn the experiment Sr atoms in a beam are excited to\nthe doubly excited 5d17l state with l = 12 using four\n1\n\n\fpulsed lasers and a Stark switching technique, as shown\nin the energy level diagram of Fig. 1 and described in detail elsewhere [11]. Sr atoms in the 5d17l state are then\nexposed to a fifth, 550 nm, laser pulse which excites them\nto the energy range between the Sr+ 5f and 5g ionization limits. This excitation could imaginably produce\neither directly a Sr+ 5f ion together with a free electron\nor a 5gnl\u2032 atom. This latter state autoionizes quickly\n(in roughly 1 ns), thus producing a free electron and so\nwould again leave the ion predominantly in the excited\nSr+ 5f state. The same 550nm laser pulse then ionizes\nthe Sr+ 5f ion to produce Sr++ [12]. The production of\nSr++ is proportional to the excitation by the first 550\nnm photon. Approximately 100ns after the laser pulse\nwe apply a 1 kV/cm electric field pulse which drives the\nSr++ ions to a dual microchannel plate detector. The\ndetector signal is recorded with a gated integrator as the\nwavelength of the 550 nm laser is slowly scanned over\nmany shots of the lasers. The observed photoionization\nspectrum is shown in Fig. 2. In it a clear series of symmetric, apparently Lorentzian peaks, at the locations of\nthe 5gnl\u2032 states (l\u2032 = 11, 13), is quite evident, and there\nis no photoionization between the peaks. At first glance\nit seems obvious that we are only exciting the 5gnl\u2032 states\nand not exciting the 5f \u01ebl continuum at all. However, after more careful consideration it becomes apparent that\nquite the opposite is true. The initial 5d17l state is well\nrepresented by an independent particle picture, i.e., a\nSr+ 5d ion with a hydrogenic nl electron bound to it, and\nthe wavefunction is the product of these two wavefunctions. There is evidently no electric dipole coupling from\nthe 5d17l state to the 5gnl\u2032 state. In contrast, the dipole\ncoupling from the 5d17l state to the 5f \u01ebl continuum is\nallowed. In particular the Sr+ ion makes the 5d \u2212 5f\ntransition, and the nl spectator electron is shaken off to\nthe \u01ebl continuum, resulting in the 5f \u01ebl final state [13\u201315].\nHowever, shake off to the unperturbed hydrogenic 5f \u01ebl\ncontinuum, \u03c8E is everywhere forbidden, and we only observe the excitation to the 5f \u01ebl continuum where it is\nphase shifted by its interaction with the 5gnl\u2032 states.\nFano's theory describes the excitation from an initial\nstate i to a final state f , which consists of a discrete state\n\u03c6 at energy E\u03c6 and the degenerate continuum \u03c8E , which\nwe assume to be energy normalized. (We follow the notation of ref. 1.) It is most often the case that the coupling\nfrom the discrete state to the continuum, VE , is energy\nindependent, and we here consider this case. This coupling broadens the discrete state so that it has a width\n(FWHM), \u0393 = 2\u03c0|VE |2 , and the natural energy scale for\nthe problem is the reduced energy, \u01eb = 2(E \u2212 E\u03c6 )/\u0393. In\naddition to broadening the discrete state, \u03c6, the coupling\nVE also produces a phase shift \u2206 in the radial phase of\nthe continuum wave function, and as we pass from far below to far above the discrete state at E\u03c6 there is a phase\nshift of \u03c0. In particular, \u2206 is given by \u2206 = cot\u22121 (\u01eb),\nso that far below, at, and far above the resonance at\n\nE\u03c6 , \u2206 = 0, \u03c0/2, and \u03c0, respectively. Well removed from\nthe resonance the continuum wavefunction is described\nby its unperturbed solution \u03c8E \u223c sin(kr + \u03c6bg ) where\nk is the continuum electron's wave number and \u03c6bg is a\nbackground phase. At the resonance, E\u03c6 , it is described\nby its phase shifted solution, \u039bE with asymptotic form\n\u223c cos(kr + \u03c6bg ), and in general by \u03c8E cos(\u2206)+ \u039bE sin(\u2206)\nwith asymptotic form sin(kr + \u03c6bg + \u2206). [1,16] The\nresulting continuum wavefunction has the same asymptotic amplitude across the resonance. We note that these\nforms of the continuum wavefunction, given in ref. 1, are\nappropriate for short range potentials.\n10\n\n++\n\nSr -signal (a.u.)\n\na)\n\n19\n\n24\n\n8\n6\n4\n2\n545\n\n550\n\n555\n\nb)\n6\n\n19\n\n3\n\nSr\n\n++\n\nsignal (a.u.)\n\n24\n\n550\n\n551\n\n552\n\n553\n\n554\n\nwavelength of the 5th laser (nm)\n\nFIG. 2.

In Fano's theory the phase shifted continuum is represented as a principal part integral over the unperturbed\ncontinuum, yielding the following expression,\nZ\n\u2217\n1\nh\u03c6|\u03bc|ii sin \u2206\n\u2032 VE \u2032 h\u03c8E \u2032 |\u03bc|ii\n+\nP\ndE\nsin \u2206\n\u03c3\u221d\n\u03c0VE\u2217\n\u03c0VE\u2217\n(E \u2212 E \u2032 )\n2\n\n\u2212h\u03c8E |\u03bc|ii cos \u2206 ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03bc is the transition electric dipole moment, h\u03c6|\u03bc|ii\nand h\u03c8E |\u03bc|ii are the excitation matrix elements to the\ndiscrete state and the unperturbed continuum, and P\ndenotes a principal part integral.\nIf the excitation amplitude to the continuum h\u03c8E |\u03bc|ii\n2\n\n\fis assumed to be energy independent, it appears that the\nprincipal part integral can be neglected, and doing so\nleads to the following common misinterpretation of the\ntheory. Namely, if there is no continuum excitation, there\nis a symmetric, approximately Lorentzian peak of width\n\u0393 centered at E\u03c6 . On the other hand, if there is no excitation of the discrete state, h\u03c6|\u03bc|ii, there is a symmetric\ndip, or window resonance, in the photoionization cross\nsection with vanishing excitation at E\u03c6 . If both amplitudes are non zero the resulting interference term leads\nto the familiar asymmetric Fano lineshape.\nIn addition to being a source of confusion, writing the\ncontinuum \u039bE as the principal part integral of Eq. (1) is\nincorrect for long range potentials which support bound\nstates. It thus does not correctly represent photoionization, as shown graphically by our experiment. However, it does represent \u039bE correctly for short range potentials, as encountered in photodetachment [17]. There\nare two straightforward ways to remedy this shortcoming\nof Fano's theory. The first is to extend the principal part\nintegral of Eq. (1) so that it includes not only the unperturbed continuum \u03c8E (here 5f \u01ebl), but the associated\nbound states as well (here 5f nl) [18]. This extension ultimately reflects the fact that the set of continuum states\n(here 5f \u01ebl) are not by themselves complete in terms of\nthe radial functions. The second is to adopt a more physical approach and rewrite Eq. (1) using the phase shifted\ncontinuum explicitly, i.e.\n\nlineshape can be obtained using Eq. (3), and several are\nshown in Fig. 3 for different positive values of \u03c6i \u2264 \u03c0/2.\nFor negative values the profiles are reflected through \u01eb =\n0. As shown by Fig. 3, \u03c6i = \u03c0/2 leads to symmetric\npeaks, as seen in our spectrum of Fig. 2.\n\n1,0\n\n\u03c3 (arb. units)\n\n0,8\n\n0,0\n-10\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\nFIG. 3.

For \u03c6 < 0\nthe profiles are reflected through \u01eb = 0.\n\nWhy the spectrum of Fig. 2 is a case in which \u03c6i = \u03c0/2\nis easily understood. If we consider any one of the peaks\nof Fig. 2, the discrete state \u03c6 is the 5gnl\u2032 state and\nthe unperturbed continuum \u03c8E is the 5f \u01ebl continuum.\nAs we have already stated, the dipole moment from the\ninitial state, i = 5d17l, to the discrete state, \u03c6 = 5gnl\u2032 ,\nvanishes. The dipole matrix element for excitation from\nthe 5d17l state to the 5f \u01ebl continuum is given by\n\nIn this form it is apparent that discarding the principal\npart integral is equivalent to neglecting the excitation\namplitude to the phase shifted continuum, \u039bE , which is\nlikely to be comparable to or greater than the excitation\namplitude to the unperturbed continuum \u03c8E .\nThe most physically appealing way of writing Eq.\n(2) is to assume a sinusoidal dependence of the continuum excitation amplitude on the phase \u2206 and replace h\u03c8E |\u03bc|ii cos \u2206 + h\u039bE |\u03bc|ii sin \u2206 in Eq. (2) by\nh\u03c8E |\u03bc|iimax cos(\u2206 \u2212 \u03c6i ). Here h\u03c8E |\u03bc|iimax is the maximum transition amplitude from i to the continuum as\na function of the radial continuum phase, and \u03c6i is a\nmeasure of the radial phase difference between the initial\nstate and the unperturbed continuum \u03c8E . h\u03c8E |\u03bc|iimax ,\nassumed to be positive, decreases slowly with energy.\nFar from the resonance, where \u2206 = 0 or \u03c0, the excitation amplitude to the continuum takes the value\n\u00b1h\u03c8E |\u03bc|iimax cos \u03c6i , which is in general smaller in magnitude than h\u03c8E |\u03bc|iimax . With this modification the cross\nsection is given by\n\nh5f \u01ebl|\u03bc|5d17li = h5f |\u03bc|5dih\u01ebl|17li,\n\n(4)\n\ni.e., a product of the ionic dipole matrix element and an\noverlap integral for the outer electron. In both the unperturbed 5d17l state and the unperturbed 5f \u01ebl continuum,\nthe outer (17l or \u01ebl) electron states are hydrogenic and\nhave quantum defects \u03b4 = 0. Consequently, the overlap integral h17l|\u01ebli vanishes due to the orthogonality of\nthe 17l and \u01ebl radial wavefunctions. Evidently, with no\ninteraction between the discrete state and the continuum there would be no continuum excitation. However,\nwhen the configuration interaction is taken into account\nthe continuum excitation is allowed. Specifically, as we\npass the energies of the 5gnl\u2032 states the interaction of\nthe 5f \u01ebl continuum with the 5gnl\u2032 states causes the radial continuum phase to go through a phase shift of \u03c0.\nThe change in the radial phase causes the overlap integral\nof Eq. (4) to depart from zero. In particular, it oscillates\nsinusoidally with \u2206, having the form\n\n2\n\nh\u03c6|\u03bc|ii sin \u2206\n\u2212 h\u03c8E |\u03bc|iimax cos(\u2206 \u2212 \u03c6i ) .\n\u03c0VE\u2217\n\n-5\n\n\u03b5\n\nh\u03c6|\u03bc|ii sin \u2206\n\u2212h\u03c8E |\u03bc|ii cos \u2206 \u2212 h\u039bE |\u03bc|ii sin \u2206 .

While we have here described\nthe photoexcitation at a single resonance using an adaptation of Fano's configuration interaction theory which is\napplicable to long range potentials, we can also readily\ndevelop a quantum defect theory description extending\nfrom below the 5f limit to above the 5g limit.\nIt is a pleasure to acknowledge helpful conversations\nwith W. Sandner, M. Fowler, R.R. Jones and H.J. Weber.

Clearly the overlap integral reaches its maximum\nat \u2206 = \u03c0/2, the location of the 5gnl\u2032 states. With this\nobservation we can use Eqs. (4) and (5) to write the\nsecond term of Eq. (3) for our spectrum of Fig. 2 as\nh\u03c8E |\u03bc|iimax cos(\u2206 \u2212 \u03c6i ) =\nh5f |\u03bc|5dih\u01ebl|17dimax cos(\u2206 \u2212 \u03c0/2),\n\n(6)\n\ni.e., the spectrum of Fig. 2 corresponds to the \u03c6i = \u03c0/2\ncase shown in Fig. 3. In spite of the fact that the peaks\nof Fig. 2 appear to be from excitation of the discrete\n5gnl\u2032 states, they are due only to the phase shifted 5f \u01ebl\ncontinuum. Asymmetric lineshapes attributed to pure\ncontinuum excitation have been observed previously, but\nit was less clear in those cases that there was no excitation\nto the discrete state [14,15].\nIt is conventional to express the shape of the resonance\nas the ratio of the photoionization cross section to the\ncross section of the unperturbed continuum, i.e. as\nhf |\u03bc|ii\nh\u03c8E |\u03bc|ii\n\n2\n\n=\n\n(q + \u01eb)2\n,\n1 + \u01eb2\n\n[1] U.

(1) or (2). If we use\nthe original Fano form of Eq. (1) and ignore the principal part integral, the second term in the numerator of\nEq. (8) is missing while the q of the resonance seems\nto provide immediately the ratio of the amplitudes for\ndiscrete and continuum excitation (and is often used as\nsuch [19]).

In the absence of excitation to\nthe discrete state q = \u2212 tan \u03c6i and can take any value.\nIn conclusion, we have observed symmetric peaks in\na photoionization spectrum which appear to be due to\nexcitation of only the discrete state. However, they are\ndue to pure continuum excitation, in particular, to the\nphase shifted continuum \u039bE , since excitation to the unperturbed continuum \u03c8E vanishes. More generally, pure\ncontinuum excitation can lead to the entire range of Fano\nprofiles so that an asymmetric lineshape does not necessarily imply interference between the bound and continuum excitation amplitudes.
