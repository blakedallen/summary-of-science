Introduction\nAt low temperature, in Yang-Mills theory static quarks and anti-quarks are confined to\none another by an unbreakable string. The string itself is an interesting object with peculiar dynamical properties. The relevant energy scale for these dynamics is set by the\nstring tension \u03c3, which defines the asymptotic slope of the linearly rising quark-anti-quark\npotential. The string tension also controls the amplitude of transverse fluctuations of the\nstring. As was pointed out a long time ago by L\u00fcscher, Symanzik, and Weisz [1], these\nfluctuations are described by a systematic low-energy effective string theory. In fact, the\ntransverse fluctuations are massless modes (i.e. Goldstone excitations) of a spontaneously\nbroken translational symmetry of the string world-sheet, also known as capillary waves in\ncondensed matter physics. The effective string theory plays the role of chiral perturbation\ntheory for these Goldstone modes. Using the effective theory, L\u00fcscher has calculated the\nleading correction to the linear quark-anti-quark potential\nV (r) = \u03c3r \u2212\n\n\u03c0(d \u2212 2)\n+ O(1/r 3 ),\n24r\n\n(1.1)\n\nwhere d is the space-time dimension and (d \u2212 2) counts the directions transverse to the\nstring world-sheet [1, 2]. Accurate numerical simulations have shown the validity of that\nexpectation [3\u201312]. The effective theory also accounts for the string width [13]. Due to\nits transverse fluctuations, the string broadens as the quark sources are separated. The\ncross-sectional area swept out by the fluctuating string increases logarithmically with the\ndistance r between the static sources, i.e.\n2\n(r/2) =\nwlo\n\nd\u22122\nlog(r/r0 ).\n2\u03c0\u03c3\n\n(1.2)\n\nHere wlo (r/2) is the leading-order string width at the distance r/2, half-way between the\nexternal static quark sources, and r0 is a length scale that enters the effective string theory\nas a low-energy parameter. The above expression for the width is universal and applies to\nstrings in Yang-Mills theory as well as to fluctuating interfaces between different phases of\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n\fcondensed matter. It has been verified in numerical simulations for the interfaces separating\nthe two low-temperature phases of the 3-d Ising model above the roughening transition [14].\nSimilar results have been obtained in a (2 + 1)-d Z(4) gauge theory [15]. Since numerical\nlattice calculations of the string width in non-Abelian gauge theories are computationally\nvery challenging, early calculations were affected by large statistical errors and did thus\nnot yield conclusive results [16]. Only recently, using the very efficient L\u00fcscher-Weisz\nmulti-level algorithm [6, 17], the logarithmically divergent string width has been accurately\nverified by simulating (2 + 1)-d SU (2) lattice Yang-Mills theory [18]. Recent results on the\neffective string description of the color flux tube in (2 + 1)-d SU (N ) Yang-Mills theory can\nbe found in [19, 20].\nAt low temperature T = 1/\u03b2, the extent \u03b2 of the periodic Euclidean time direction\n\u221a\nenters as another length scale in the low-energy effective string theory. At low T \u226a \u03c3,\nthe temperature effects on the string tension and the string broadening are again accessible\nto a systematic treatment. At leading order, the temperature-dependent string tension is\ngiven by\n\u03c0(d \u2212 2)\n\u03c3(\u03b2) = \u03c3 \u2212\n.\n(1.3)\n6\u03b2 2\nSimilarly, the leading-order string width at a distance r/2 \u226b \u03b2 takes the form [21, 22]\n2\n(r/2) =\nwlo\n\nd\u22122\n\u03b2\nd\u22122\nlog\n+\nr + O(e\u22122\u03c0r/\u03b2 ).\n2\u03c0\u03c3\n4r0\n4\u03b2\u03c3\n\n(1.4)\n\nHence, at non-zero temperature the confining string broadens linearly with the distance\nbetween the external static quarks. Numerical evidence for linear string broadening at finite\ntemperature was presented for fluctuating interfaces in the 3-d Ising model in [21, 22] and,\nrecently, for (3 + 1)-d SU (3) Yang-Mills theory in [23]. In this paper, using the L\u00fcscherWeisz multi-level simulation technique, we perform very accurate Monte Carlo calculations\nof the temperature-dependent string width in (2 + 1)-d SU (2) Yang-Mills theory. The\nnumerical results are then compared with the corresponding analytic predictions of the\nsystematic low-energy effective string theory at the 2-loop level [24]. Since the low-energy\nparameters of the effective theory were previously fixed by a comparison with Monte Carlo\ndata at zero temperature, there are no adjustable parameters. We find perfect agreement\nbetween the numerical data and the analytic predictions, which lends further support to\nthe quantitative validity of the effective theory.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the analytic calculations in the low-energy effective string theory, which are then compared with the numerical\nresults obtained in section 3. Section 4 contains our conclusions.\n\n2. Analytic Results of the Low-Energy Effective String Theory\nLet us consider the systematic low-energy effective theory describing the transverse fluctuations of the string world sheet in (2 + 1)-d Yang-Mills theory. In terms of the height\nvariable h(x, t) the corresponding Euclidean action is given by\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ \u03b2 Z r\n1\n\u03c3\n2\n\u2202\u03bc h\u2202\u03bc h \u2212 (\u2202\u03bc h\u2202\u03bc h) .\n(2.1)\ndx\ndt\nS[h] =\n2\n4\n0\n0\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n\fHere x \u2208 [0, r] and t \u2208 [0, \u03b2] parameterize the 2-d base-space. Since the string ends at static\nquark charges separated by a distance r, its fluctuation field obeys the boundary condition\nh(0, t) = h(r, t) = 0. The boundary conditions explicitly break translation invariance and\none might have expected boundary terms to be present in the effective action as well [6].\nRemarkably, due to open-closed string duality, such terms are absent and the prefactor of\nthe first sub-leading term is uniquely determined [25]. This behavior even extends to the\nnext order six-derivative term. Indeed, up to that order the effective action coincides with\nthe one of the Nambu-Goto string [26\u201328].\nThe confining string of a lattice Yang-Mills theory suffers from lattice artifacts which\ndisappear only in the continuum limit. Away from the continuum limit, in the strong coupling regime, the lattice string is rigid, i.e. it follows the discrete lattice steps and does not\neven support massless fluctuations. When one crosses the roughening transition at intermediate values of the coupling, one enters the rough phase with massless Goldstone excitations\nof the string, to which the low-energy effective string theory applies. Since the lattice theory is invariant only under discrete rotations and not under the full Poincar\u00e9 group, before\nP\none reaches the continuum limit two additional terms proportional to \u03bc=1,2 \u2202\u03bc \u2202\u03bc h\u2202\u03bc \u2202\u03bc h\nP\nand to \u03bc=1,2 (\u2202\u03bc h)4 enter the effective theory in the bulk. Since these terms contain four\nderivatives, they are of sub-leading order. Hence, they have no effect on the L\u00fcscher term\nor on the leading behavior of the string width. As a result, the L\u00fcscher term is indeed completely universal. Provided its world-sheet is rough, even a lattice string supports exactly\nmassless modes which contribute \u2212\u03c0/24r to the static quark potential. In particular, this\nterm is not affected by lattice spacing artifacts, since such effects are of sub-leading order.\nIn the following, we will work sufficiently close to the continuum limit of the lattice theory.\nIn that case, the effective action of eq.(2.1) without the additional non-rotational-invariant\nterms is sufficient.\nRecently, an analytic expression for the string width at zero temperature has been\nderived from the effective string theory at the 2-loop level [24]\n2\n\nw (r/2) =\n\n\u0012\n\n4\u03c0f (\u03c4 )\n1+\n\u03c3r 2\n\n\u0013\n\n2\nwlo\n(r/2) \u2212\n\nf (\u03c4 ) + g(\u03c4 )\n,\n\u03c32r2\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhere\nE2 (\u03c4 ) \u2212 4E2 (2\u03c4 )\nf (\u03c4 ) =\n,\n48\n\ng(\u03c4 ) = i\u03c0\u03c4\n\n\u0012\n\nE2 (\u03c4 )\nd\n\u2212q\n12\ndq\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\nE2 (\u03c4 )\nf (\u03c4 ) +\n16\n\n\u0013\n\n+\n\nE2 (\u03c4 )\n.

We use the standard Wilson plaquette action\nS[U ] = \u2212\n\n2 X\n\u2020\n\u2020\nTr[Ux,\u03bc Ux+\u03bc\u0302,\u03bd Ux+\u03bd\u0302,\u03bc\nUx,\u03bd\n],\ng 2 x,\u03bc,\u03bd\n\n(3.2)\n\nwhere g is the bare gauge coupling and \u03bc\u0302 is a unit-vector pointing in the \u03bc-direction. As\nusual in lattice calculations, all physical quantities are expressed in units of the lattice\nspacing which is set to 1.\n\n\u20134\u2013\n\n\fThe external static quarks at the two ends of the confining string are represented by\nPolyakov loops\n#\n\" \u03b2\nY\n(3.3)\nUx+t2\u0302,2 ,\n\u03a6x = Tr\nt=1\n\nwhich wind around the periodic Euclidean time direction. We choose the 2-direction to\nrepresent Euclidean time. When two external quarks are separated in the 1-direction, the\nworld-sheet of the confining string extends in the space-time directions \u03bc = 1, 2, while the\nstring fluctuates in the transverse 3-direction. The static quark potential V (r) is extracted\nfrom the Polyakov loop correlation function\nZ\n1\nh\u03a60 \u03a6r i =\nDU \u03a60 \u03a6r exp(\u2212S[U ]) \u223c exp(\u2212\u03b2V (r)),\n(3.4)\nZ\nin the zero-temperature limit \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e.\nThe force between the two static quarks is extracted from the discrete derivative of\nthe static potential\nF (r\u0304) = V (r + 1) \u2212 V (r) = \u2212\n\nh\u03a60 \u03a6r+1 i\n1\nlog\n,\n\u03b2\nh\u03a60 \u03a6r i\n\n(3.5)\n\nwhere, writing explicitly the lattice spacing a, r\u0304 = r + a2 + O(a2 ) is an improved definition\nof the point where the force is computed [30].\nThe width of the string is determined from the connected correlation function\nC(x3 ) =\n\nh\u03a60 \u03a6r Px i\n\u2212 hPx i,\nh\u03a60 \u03a6r i\n\n(3.6)\n\nof a pair of Polyakov loops with a single plaquette\n\u2020\nPx = Tr[Ux,1 Ux+1\u0302,2 Ux+\nU \u2020 ],\n2\u0302,1 x,2\n\n(3.7)\n\nin the 1-2 plane, which measures the color-electric field along the 1-direction of the string\nas a function of the transverse displacement x3 . The plaquette is located at the site\nx = (r/2, t, x3 ) and thus measures the transverse fluctuations of the color flux tube at the\nmaximal distance r/2 from the external quark charges.\nWe have performed numerical simulations at the bare gauge coupling 4/g2 = 9.0 on a\n902 \u00d7 16 lattice, corresponding to T /Tc \u2248 0.38. We have used the L\u00fcscher-Weisz technique\n[6, 17] with a single level and with slices of thickness 4. In table 1 we report the number\nof sub-lattice updates for various ranges of distances between the static sources.\nIn figure 1, we plot the force between the two static quarks as a function of the\ndistance between the sources. The dotted line is the force in the leading order approximation of eq.(2.8). The solid line is the next-to-leading order approximation given by\neq.(2.9). It is important to note that there is no free parameter and \u03c3 = 0.025897(15) is\nthe zero-temperature string tension. The next-to-leading order expression already provides\na very good description of the numerical data. Considering the accuracy of the data, it is\nreasonable to expect that the residual tiny discrepancy can be described by the next-tonext-to-leading order correction.\n\n\u20135\u2013\n\n\fr range\n4-8\n9-15\n16-22\n23-25\n\nupdates\n3200\n24000\n32000\n80000\n\nTable 1: Number of sub-lattice updates of the single level L\u00fcscher-Weisz algorithm for various\nranges of distances between the static sources.\n0.03\ndata\n\n0.029\n\n0.028\n\n0.027\n\n0.026\n\n0.025\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nFigure 1: The force F (r\u0304) as a function of the distance between the two static quarks. The dotted\nline and the solid line are the leading order approximation of eq.(2.8) and the next-to-leading order\napproximation of eq.(2.9), respectively.\n\nFor the measurement of the string width, the correlation function is fit to the ansatz\nh\u03a60 \u03a6r Px i\n1 + B exp(\u2212x23 /s)\n= A exp(\u2212x23 /s)\n+ K,\nh\u03a60 \u03a6r i\n1 + D exp(\u2212x23 /s)\n\n(3.8)\n\nand the squared width of the string is then obtained as the second moment of the correlation\nfunction\nR\ndx3 x23 C(x3 )\n2\n.\n(3.9)\nw (r/2) = R\ndx3 C(x3 )\n\nIn figure 2, we show the bell-shaped correlation function h\u03a60 \u03a6r Px i/h\u03a60 \u03a6r i as a function of the transverse displacement of the plaquette from the plane of the string world-sheet.\nThe data refer to a pair of static sources at fixed distance r = 17. The solid line is a fit of\nthe data using the ansatz (3.8).\nThe scale that determines the logarithmic broadening of the string at zero temperature\n\u221a\nwas previously determined as r0 = 2.26(2) such that r0 \u03c3 = 0.364(3) [18]. It is important\n\n\u20136\u2013\n\n\f0.88585\n\n0.8858\n\n0.88575\n\n0.8857\n\n0.88565\n\n0.8856\n\n0.88555\n\n0.8855\n\n0.88545\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\nFigure 2: The ratio h\u03a6h\u03a60 \u03a60 \u03a6r Pr ix i as a function of the transverse displacement x3 of the plaquette from\nthe plane of the string world-sheet. The distance between the two static sources is r = 17. The\nsolid curve is a fit using eq.(3.8).\n\nto note that \u03c3 and r0 are the only low-energy parameters entering the 2-loop formula for\nthe width of the flux tube. Hence the theoretical prediction resulting from the low-energy\neffective theory is completely determined without any additional adjustable parameter.\nIn figure 3 we report the observed dependence of the flux tube width on the distance\nbetween the static sources as resulting from numerical Monte Carlo simulations. The two\nsolid lines represent the fully constrained prediction of the low-energy effective string theory\ncorresponding to the choices r0 = 2.26\u00b1 0.02. The numerical data show the expected linear\nbehavior for sufficiently large separations of the sources and the agreement with the analytic\nformula turns out to be excellent.\nFinally, it is important to notice that the next-to-leading expression (2.2) for the width\nis not sensitive to the next-to-leading correction to the string tension. In fact, the 2-loop\nresult for the width goes up to corrections of order 1/(\u03c3\u03b2 2 ) and so the corrections of order\n1/(\u03c3\u03b2 2 )2 to the string tension will appear as 3-loop corrections to the width. Looking at\nthe data for the width in figure 3, the accuracy is such that we are not very sensitive to the\nnext-to-leading correction to the string tension and one cannot detect the tiny difference\nthat the direct measurement of the force in figure 1 shows.\n\n4. Conclusions\nUsing the L\u00fcscher-Weisz multi-level simulation technique, we have performed high-accuracy\nnumerical simulations of the confining string connecting two static quarks in (2+1)-d SU (2)\n\n\u20137\u2013\n\n\f20\n\n18\n\n16\n\n14\n\n12\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nFigure 3: The squared width of the confining string at its midpoint w2 (r/2) as a function of the\nseparation of the static sources r. The dotted line is the leading order prediction of the low-energy\neffective string theory using r0 = 2.26. The two solid lines represent the 2-loop prediction using\nr0 = 2.26 \u00b1 0.02.\n\nYang-Mills theory. The results for the finite temperature string width have been compared\nwith analytic 2-loop calculations performed in the corresponding systematic low-energy\neffective string theory. Since the low-energy parameters \u03c3 and r0 were already determined\nat zero temperature, there were no further adjustable parameters in the comparison of the\neffective theory with the numerical simulations of the lattice Yang-Mills theory. Remarkably, there is perfect agreement between the underlying Yang-Mills theory and the effective\nstring theory, thus confirming the quantitative correctness of the latter. With sufficient\nnumerical resources (which are still modest on today's standards in lattice field theory) it\nis certainly feasible to extend our study to other gauge groups and to (3 + 1) dimensions. A\nsimilar investigation in (3 + 1)-d SU (3) Yang-Mills theory would definitely be possible. In\nparticular, it would be interesting to investigate whether the effective theory works equally\nwell in the numerically accessible regime as in the (2 + 1)-d case investigated here.\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe gratefully acknowledge helpful discussions with M.
