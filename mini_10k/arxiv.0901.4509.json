Marvin Herndon\nTransdyne Corporation\nSan Diego, CA 92131 USA\nHerndon@NuclearPlanet.com\n\nAbstract: Herndon\u201fs georeactor at the center of Earth is immune to meltdown, which is not the\ncase for recently published copy-cat georeactors, which would necessarily be subject to \"hot\"\nnuclear fuel, prevailing high-temperature environments, and high confining pressures. Herndon\u201fs\ngeoreactor uniquely is expected to be self-regulating through establishing a balance between\nheat-production and actinide settling-out. The seventy year old idea of convection in the Earth\u201fs\nfluid core is refuted because thermal expansion cannot overcome the 23% higher density at the\ncore\u201fs bottom than at its top. The dimensionless Rayleigh Number is an inappropriate indicator\nof convection in the Earth\u201fs core and mantle as a consequence of the assumptions under which it\nwas derived. Implications bearing on the origin of the geomagnetic field, the physical\nimpossibility of mantle convection, and the concomitant refutation of plate tectonics theory are\nbriefly described.\n\nIn 1993 and 1994, Herndon [1, 2] published the concept and applied Fermi\u201fs nuclear reactor\ntheory [3] to demonstrate the feasibility of a naturally occurring nuclear fission at the center of\nthe Earth, now called the georeactor, as the energy source for the geomagnetic field. In 1996,\nHerndon [4] disclosed the sub-structure of the inner core, describing the two-component\nstructure of the georeactor as consisting of an actinide sub-core, surrounded by a sub-shell\ncomposed of the products of nuclear fission and radioactive decay, all surrounded by the inner\ncore. He also noted the possibility that the sub-shell might be a liquid or slurry.\nIn 2001, Hollenbach and Herndon [5] published the first georeactor numerical simulation\nconducted using Oak Ridge National Laboratory\u201fs SCALE software, which has been validated\nwith nuclear reactor operating data combined with analyses of spent fuel rods [6]. The numerical\nsimulations showed that georeactor-produced 3He and 4He would have the same range of\n1\n\n\fcompositions as helium measured in oceanic basalts [7]. Subsequently, Herndon [8] published\nmore precise numerical simulation data, examples of which are shown in Figure 1 from [9]. The\nmarked, progressive increase in 3He/4He ratios over time occurs as a consequence of diminished\n4\n\nHe production from radioactive decay as uranium is consumed. Herndon suggested that the high\n\n3\n\nHe/4He ratios observed in Hawaiian and Icelandic lavas [10] portend the demise of the\n\ngeoreactor, although the time scale is uncertain [11].\n\nFigure 1. Georeactor numerical simulation 3He/4He ratios, relative to those in air, over the age of\nthe Earth, calculated at power levels of 3 and 5 terawatts (TW). Arrow indicates present age of\nEarth. Range of measured oceanic basalt helium ratios at 95% confidence intervals are shown for\ntwo major oceanic provinces. Note that helium ratios as high as 37 relative to air are observed in\nsome samples of Icelandic and Hawaiian lavas.\nAs individuals started to appreciate the importance of the georeactor concept, \"copy-cat\"\ngeoreactors began to be published in the scientific literature. These all possess the common\nfeature of supposedly occurring at places other than at the center of the Earth, specifically, at the\ncore-mantle boundary [12] and at the surface of the inner core [13, 14]. All copy-cat georeactors\nare absence one consideration, which is their common Achilles heel \u2013 the potential for\nmeltdown.\nFigure 2 shows the 235U/238U ratio of Herndon\u201fs georeactor over the age of Earth from numerical\nsimulation calculations [8]. For reference, the\n\n235\n\n2\n\nU/238U ratio is also shown for (i) the Oklo\n\n\fnatural nuclear reactor in the Republic of Gabon at time of its operation, (ii) the Chernobyl\nnuclear reactor which suffered meltdown and (iii) natural uranium at present time. Note the high\ngeoreactor 235U/238U ratios, especially during the first 1.5 billion years of Earth\u201fs existence. Even\nat present, that ratio is still \"hot\" from a nuclear fission standpoint as compared, for example, to\nChernobyl fuel. Such high\n\n235\n\nU/238U ratios strongly enhance copy-cat georeactor meltdown,\n\nwhich would lead to the dense uranium progressing downward to Earth\u201fs center, if not being\ndiluted by the molten underlying matter until criticality ceases.\n\nFigure 2. Georeactor 235U/238U ratios over the age of the Earth. Reference points are shown for\nthe Oklo natural reactor, Chernobyl reactor, and natural uranium at present.\nCopy-cat georeactor meltdown to the location of Herndon\u201fs georeactor appears inevitable as no\nnuclear fission control mechanism for these hypothetical reactors is known. Unlike, for example,\nthe Earth-surface natural reactor at Oklo which did not experience meltdown as it began to\nfunction with a significantly lower\n\n235\n\nU/238U ratio in a low-temperature environment and\n\nfunctioned primarily as a thermal neutron reactor, moderated by and pulse-controlled by easily\nvolatilized groundwater [15].\n\n3\n\n\fCopy-cat georeactor meltdown is also enhanced by the high-temperatures that prevail adjacent to\nEarth\u201fs molten iron alloy core. Moreover, the pressures that prevail at the core-mantle-boundary\n(140 GPa) and atop the inner core (330 GPa) tend to oppose copy-cat reactor disassembly,\nfurther enhancing their potential for meltdown.\n\nFigure 3. Schematic view of Earth\u201fs interior showing Herndon\u201fs georeactor.\nFigure 3 from [9] is a schematic representation of the parts of the interior of Earth, showing\nHerndon\u201fs georeactor. Note that the actinide fuel lies at the gravitational center, the ultimate\nmeltdown-endpoint. Herndon [16] recently published evidence that the neutron-absorbing subshell, surrounding the actinide sub-core, is a liquid or slurry. He also pointed out that, because\nthe surrounding inner core is a massive, thermally-conducting heat sink, surrounded by the core,\nan even more massive thermally-conducting heat sink, long-term-stable convection is to be\nexpected in the georeactor sub-shell. Moreover, as suggested here, sub-shell convection provides\na mechanism for enhancing georeactor stability.\nIn the micro-gravity environment at the center of Earth, georeactor heat production that is too\nenergetic would be expected to cause actinide sub-core disassembly, mixing actinide elements\nwith neutron-absorbers of the sub-shell, quenching the nuclear fission chain reaction. But as the\ndenser actinide elements begin to settle out of the mix, the chain reaction would re-start,\n\n4\n\n\fultimately establishing a balance, an equilibrium between heat-production and actinide settlingout, a self-regulating control mechanism.\nSeventy years ago, Elsasser [17] published his idea that the geomagnetic field is produced by\nconvective motions in the Earth\u201fs fluid, electrically-conducting core, interacting with Coriolis\nforces produced by planetary rotation, creating a dynamo mechanism, a magnetic amplifier.\nFrom studies of rock-magnetism [18], it is known that the geomagnetic field has existed for at\nleast 3.5 billion years. The geomagnetic field has been remarkably stable for long periods of\ntime, including intervals of more than 40 million years without reversals.\nChandrasekhar [19] described convection in the following way: \"The simplest example of\nthermally induced convection arises when a horizontal layer of fluid is heated from below and an\nadverse temperature gradient is maintained. The adjective \u201eadverse\u201f is used to qualify the\nprevailing temperature gradient, since, on account of thermal expansion, the fluid at the bottom\nbecomes lighter than the fluid at the top; and this is a top-heavy arrangement which is potentially\nunstable. Under these circumstances the fluid will try to redistribute itself to redress this\nweakness in its arrangement. This is how thermal convection originates: It represents the efforts\nof the fluid to restore to itself some degree of stability.\" Understanding the clarity of\nChandrasekhar\u201fs explanation has led to two reasons that convection in the Earth\u201fs fluid core is\nphysically impossible.\nRecently, Herndon [16] pointed out that the Earth\u201fs fluid core is wrapped in an insulating\nblanket, a rock shell, the mantle, that is about 2900 km thick, and which has a considerably lower\nheat capacity, lower thermal conductivity, and higher viscosity than the fluid core [16]. Heat\nbrought to the top of the core cannot be efficiently removed, so maintaining a significant\ndifference in temperature between top and bottom of the core for extended periods of time, a\nrequisite condition for long-term convection, is not possible.\nFrequent reference is (wrongly) made to the parameters of the Earth\u201fs core yielding a high\nRayleigh Number supposedly indicative of vigorous convection. In 1916, Lord Rayleigh [20]\napplied the Boussinesq [21] approximation to Eulerian equations of motion to derive that\ndimensionless number to quantify the onset of instability in a thin, horizontal layer of fluid\n5\n\n\fheated from beneath. The underlying assumptions, however, are inconsistent with the physical\nparameters of the Earth\u201fs core, viz.; Earth\u201fs core being \"incompressible\", density being\n\"constant\" except as modified by thermal expansion, and pressure being \"unimportant\" (quotes\nfrom Lord Rayleigh [20]).\n\nFigure 4. Density as a function of radius in the Earth\u201fs core [22].\nAs shown in Figure 4, because of the over-burden weight, the Earth\u201fs core is about 23% more\ndense at the bottom than at the top [22]. Thermal expansion at the bottom cannot overcome such\na great difference in density, meaning the Earth\u201fs core cannot become top-heavy, and thus cannot\nengage in convection. The implication is quite clear: Either the geomagnetic field is generated by\na process other than the convection-driven dynamo-mechanism, or there exists another fluid\nregion within the deep-interior of Earth which can sustain convection for extended periods of\ntime. Herndon [16] has provided the reasonable basis to expect long-term stable convection in\nthe georeactor sub-shell, and proposed that the geomagnetic field is generated therein by the\nconvection-driven dynamo mechanism.\n\n6\n\n\fThere are fundamental differences in convection-driven dynamo action in the georeactor subshell and in the Earth\u201fs core, as has long been believed. First, the georeactor sub-shell contains a\nsubstantial quantity of continuously-supplied, neutron-rich, radioactive fission products that beta\ndecay, producing electrons which can generate magnetic seed-fields for amplification. Second,\nthe dimensions, mass, and inertia are orders of magnitude less than those of the Earth\u201fs core,\nmeaning that changes in the geomagnetic field, including reversals and excursions [23], can take\nplace on much shorter time-scales than previously thought. Similarly, external effects may\nassume greater importance. For example, one may speculate that super-intense bursts of solar\nwind might induce electrical currents and consequently ohmic heating in the georeactor subshell, perhaps destabilizing convection and leading to magnetic reversals.\nHerndon\u201fs georeactor at the center of Earth is immune to meltdown, which is not the case for\ncopy-cat georeactors, which would necessarily be subject to \"hot\" nuclear fuel, prevailing hightemperature environments, and high confining pressures. Herndon\u201fs georeactor uniquely is\nexpected to be self-regulating through establishing a balance between heat-production and\nactinide settling-out. The seventy year old idea of convection in the Earth\u201fs fluid core is refuted\nbecause thermal expansion cannot overcome the 23% higher density at the core\u201fs bottom than at\nits top.\nThe basis presented here for the absence of Earth core convection can be generalized to the\nEarth\u201fs mantle. Since the 1960\u201fs, convection has been widely assumed to occur within the\nEarth\u201fs mantle and has been incorporated as an absolutely crucial component of plate tectonics\ntheory. The concept of convection in the Earth\u201fs mantle is refuted because thermal expansion\ncannot overcome the 62% higher density at the mantle\u201fs bottom than at its top (Figure 5).\nFrequent reference is (wrongly) made to the parameters of the Earth\u201fs mantle yielding a high\nRayleigh Number supposedly indicative of vigorous convection. As with the case of the Earth\u201fs\ncore, the Rayleigh Number was derived [20] upon the basis of assumptions [21] which are\ninconsistent with the physical parameters of the Earth\u201fs mantle, viz.; Earth\u201fs mantle being\n\"incompressible\", density being \"constant\" except as modified by thermal expansion, and\npressure being \"unimportant\" (quotes from Lord Rayleigh [20]).\n\n7\n\n\fFigure 5. Density as a function of radius in the Earth\u201fs mantle [22].\nThe seeming agreement between geodynamo calculations and the observed geomagnetic field\narises because, with a change of dimensions, those calculations would apply to the georeactor\nfluid sub-shell where convection does not violate the properties of matter. Similarly, the seeming\nagreement between seafloor observations and plate tectonics arises as a consequence of global\ndynamics as described by Herndon\u201fs Whole-Earth Decompression Dynamics [24, 25], which\ndoes not require or depend upon mantle convection.\n\nReferences\n\n[1]\n\nJ.
