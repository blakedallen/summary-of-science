In the most comprehensive study to date, Basu & Antia (1997)\nhave investigated the influence of observational and theoretical systematic uncertainties as\nwell as measurement errors. Basu and Antia concluded that the base of the solar convective\nzone currently lies at a depth of\nRCZ = (0.713 \u00b1 0.001)R\u2299 .\n\n(1)\n\nThe result of Basu and Antia is consistent with the earlier measurements of Kosovichev &\nFedorova (1991), who obtained RCZ = (0.713 \u00b1 0.001)R\u2299 , and Christensen-Dalsgaard,\nGough, & Thompson (1991), who also obtained RCZ = (0.713 \u00b1 0.003R\u2299 , as well as with\nthe determination of Guzik & Cox (1993), who found RCZ = (0.712 \u00b1 0.001)R\u2299 . Basu\n(1998) also studied the effect of the assumed value of the solar radius on the inferred depth\nof the convective zone and found RCZ = (0.7135 \u00b1 0.0005)R\u2299 . The analyses in these\ndifferent studies span a wide range of reference solar models and analysis techniques.\nOn the basis of the analyses cited above, the measurement of the depth of the solar\nconvective zone appears robust and precise.\nRecently, new precision measurements have been made of the C, N, O, Ne, and Ar\nabundances on the surface of the Sun (Allende Prieto, Lambert, & Asplund 2001; Allende\nPrieto, Lambert, & Asplund 2002; Asplund et al. 2004; Asplund et al. 2000; Asplund 2000).\nThese new abundance determinations use three-dimensional rather than one-dimensional\natmospheric models, include hydrodynamical effects, and pay particular attention to\nuncertainties in atomic data and the observational spectra. The new abundance estimates,\ntogether with the previous best-estimates for other solar surface abundances (Grevesse &\nSauval 1998), imply Z/X = 0.0176, much less than the previous value of Z/X = 0.0229\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\n(Grevesse & Sauval 1998).\nFor a solar model with the recently-determined heavy element to hydrogen ratio, the\ncalculated depth of the convective zone is (Bahcall & Pinsonneault 2004)\nRCZ (Z/X = 0.0176) = 0.726R\u2299 ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhich is very different from the measured depth of the CZ (see equation [1]). On the other\nhand, Basu and Antia (2004) have shown that the helioseismological determination of\nRCZ , equation 1, is not affected if one assumes the correctness of the lower heavy element\nabundances (Z/X = 0.0176).\nSomething is wrong. We have a new solar problem: \"the convective zone (CZ)\nproblem.\"\nThe radiative opacity is a key ingredient in calculating the depth of the convective\nzone. Moreover, about 95% of the total radiative opacity near the base of the convective\nzone involves bound electrons, either bound-free or bound-bound opacity (Iglesias 2004).\nThus opacity calculations in this region involve details of the ionization balance and other\ndelicate atomic physics properties.\nIn this paper, we focus on determining the accuracy with which the opacity near the\nbase of the convective zone must be known in order to calculate precisely the depth of the\nCZ with a stellar evolution code. We also evaluate the accuracy with which the opacity\nnear the base of the CZ can be interpolated from OPAL tables. For a related comparison of\nthe Los Alamos LEDCOP opacities and the OPAL opacities, see Neuforge-Verheecke et al.\n(2001) . For comprehensive discussions of stellar radiative opacities, the reader is referred\nto the important reviews by Rogers and Iglesias (1998) and by Seaton et al. (1995).\nWe investigate in a paper in preparation (Bahcall, Basu, Pinsonneault, and Serenelli\n2004) the helioseismological implications of the changes in opacity that are discussed in the\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\npresent paper. The viability of any proposed change in the opacity discussed in the present\npaper must be tested by comparing a solar model that is evolved with the changed opacity\nwith a complete set of precise helioseismological data. There is no compelling reason to\nbelieve that the illustrative change in opacity considered here, which is highly peaked in\nradius, will be either reproduced exactly by new opacity calculations or will be precisely\nconsistent with helioseismological constraints. In the future, once new opacity calculations\nare available that satisfy the requirements described in this paper, it will be possible to\ntest simultaneously the new opacities, the solar model evolution, and the helioseismological\nimplications.\nWe derive in \u00a7 2 the dependence, \u2202 ln RCZ /\u2202 ln \u03ba, of the calculated depth of the solar\nconvective zone upon the assumed radiative opacity. We apply this result to determine the\naccuracy with which the opacity must be known in order to calculate the depth of the CZ to\nthe accuracy with which it is measured helioseismologically. We also determine the change\nin the standard OPAL opacity that is required in order to reconcile the helioseismological\nmeasurement with the recent determinations of heavy element abundances. We evaluate\nin \u00a7 3 the dependence of the radiative opacity near the base of the convective zone upon\nthe stellar composition. We find that the opacity depends sensitively upon the assumed\nheavy element abundance. We compare in \u00a7 4 the opacities obtained from two different\ninterpolation schemes that are both applied to the same published OPAL opacity tables.\nThroughout this paper, we adopt the OPAL opacities (Iglesias & Rogers 1991a,b; Rogers &\nIglesias 1992; Iglesias & Rogers 1996) as standard, when supplemented at low temperatures\nby values from Alexander & Fergusson (1994). We use simulated opacity tables in \u00a7 5\nto estimate the likely uncertainties that result from interpolations within the existing\nOPAL opacity tables and to determine the grid sizes to obtain small interpolation errors.\nFor completeness and for contrast, we use four different equations of state to show in\nAppendix A that uncertainties due to the choice of EOS are not important, at the present\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nlevel of accuracy, for the calculation of the depth of the solar convective zone. We also\ndemonstrate in Appendix B that uncertainties in the nuclear reaction rates affect the depth\nof the solar convective zone only at the level of 0.1% . In Appendix C, we verify that the\nconversion of carbon and oxygen in CNO burning, which cannot be accurately modeled with\nexisting opacity codes, causes a 0.1% uncertainty in the calculated depth of the convective\nzone. Basu and Antia (2004) (see also Asplund et al. 2004) have shown that errors in the\ncalculation of the diffusion coefficients are unlikely to be the correct explanation of the\ndiscrepancy between measured and calculated depth of the solar convective zone. Other\nsolar model ingredients, including the element diffusion coefficients, can affect the calculated\ndepth of the convective zone. A complete investigation of all the possible effects on the\nconvective zone is beyond the scope of the present paper and would distract the reader\nfrom our main concern, the effect of the radiative opacity. Moreover, we believe that the\nradiative opacity and the heavy element abundance provide the single largest contributions\nto the error budget for the calculation of the solar convective zone. The effect of the heavy\nelement abundance on the calculated depth of the convective zone has been evaluated in\nBahcall and Pinsonneault (2004). We summarize and discuss our main results in \u00a7 6.\n\n2.\n\nDEPENDENCE OF CALCULATED DEPTH OF CONVECTIVE ZONE\nON RADIATIVE OPACITY\nIn this section, we determine the dependence of the calculated depth of the solar\n\nconvective zone upon the value of the radiative opacity in the vicinity of the base of\nthe convective zone. Using this dependence, we then answer two questions. First, how\naccurately must the radiative opacity be known in order to calculate the depth of the\nconvective zone to the accuracy with which the depth is measured by helioseismology?\nSecond, how large must the error in the radiative opacity at the base of the solar convective\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nzone be in order to explain the difference between the measured value of RCZ and the value\nof RCZ that is calculated in a solar model that is constructed using the recently determined\nheavy element abundances (Z/X = 0.0176)?\nWe follow the approach introduced by Bahcall, Bahcall, & Ulrich (1969) in which we\nchange the standard (OPAL) opacity in the vicinity of the CZ by a small functional amount\nthat depends upon an adjustable parameter \u03b1. We calculate a series of solar models for\ndifferent values of \u03b1, which permits us to evaluate the logarithmic derivative of RCZ with\nrespect to the opacity near the base of the CZ. We begin with a brief description of the\nsolar models used in our studies.\n\n2.1.\n\nDescription of the solar models\n\nThe solar age adopted in this article is 4.57 \u00d7 109 yr. At this age, the solar models\nare required to have the present values for the solar luminosity (L\u2299 ), the solar radius\n(R\u2299 ), and the ratio of heavy elements to hydrogen by mass(Z/X). We adopt the values\nL\u2299 = 3.8418 \u00d7 1033 ergs\u22121 , R\u2299 = 6.9598 \u00d7 1010 cm, and Z/X = 0.0229 respectively (see\nBahcall, Pinsonneault, & Basu 2001). The models are calculated using the OPAL equation\nof state (hereafter OPAL 1996; Rogers, Swenson, & Iglesias 1996) unless stated otherwise,\nand the OPAL opacities (see \u00a7 1). The nuclear reaction rates are those used in Bahcall et\nal. (2001). Element diffusion is incorporated for helium and metals (Thoul, Bahcall, &\nLoeb 1994). We use the mixing length theory for convection and the Schwarzschild criterion\nto determine the location of the convective boundaries.\nThe adopted heavy element composition is, as discussed in Bahcall and Pinsonneault\n(2004), one of the most important ingredients in determining the value of the solar\nconvective zone that is obtained from a stellar evolution code.

OPAL opacities have been computed for the same compositions. The\natomic masses on the OPAL website were used in conjunction with these abundances to\ncompute Z/X. Although the most precise details of the composition are not important for\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nthe general issues discussed in this paper, Table 1 permits us to be make clear exactly what\ncompositions were used in the calculations described in this paper. This may be helpful\nto the reader since new composition determinations are currently appearing at frequent\nintervals.\nFor the BP04+ solar model, the initial (final) mass fractions are: X0 = .71564 (0.74862),\nY0 = 0.26960 (0.23817), and Z0 = 0.01476 (0.01321). For the BP04 model, the\ncorresponding mass fractions are: X0 = .70775 (0.72465), Y0 = 0.27344 (0.24335), and\nZ0 = 0.01881 (0.01692). Note that the helium abundances in the two models are the same\nto within about 2%, although the heavy element mass fractions differ by more than 25%.\nOne of the main goals of this paper is to compare the numerical results obtained\nfor different solar evolution codes. To this end, we compare the results obtained with\nthe Bahcall-Pinsonneault/Yale code (see Bahcall and Pinsonneault 2004 and references\ncontained therein) with the Garching/Weiss stellar evolution code. For further details\nabout the Garching stellar evolution code, we refer the reader to Schlattl, Weiss, & Ludwig\n(1997), Schlattl (2002), and references therein.\n\n2.2.\n\nEvaluation of \u2202 ln RCZ /\u2202 ln \u03ba\n\nFor relatively small changes in the radiative opacity, the sensitivity to opacity of the\ncalculated depth of the solar convective zone can be expressed in terms of a single numerical\nparameter \u03b2, which is defined by the relation\n\u03b2 \u2261\n\n\u2202 ln RCZ\n.\n\u2202 ln \u03ba\n\n(3)\n\nTo evaluate \u03b2, we multiply the OPAL opacity in the vicinity of the convective envelope\nboundary by a Lorentzian function f (T ) given by\nf (T ) = 1 +\n\n\u03b1\u03b3 2\n.\n((T \u2212 T0 )2 + \u03b3 2 )\n\n(4)\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nHere T is the temperature in the solar model. We label each radial point in the solar model\nby its corresponding value of T . We can then write for the opacity that \u03ba = \u03ba0 f (T ), where\n\u03ba0 is the unperturbed radiative opacity, \u03b1 is the amplitude of the perturbation, and \u03b3 is the\nwidth of the perturbation (defined as the point where the perturbation drops to \u03b1/2).\nAt the present solar age, the temperature at the base of the CZ is T \u2248 2.18 \u00d7 106 K, so\nthis value is adopted for T0 . We calculated solar models for \u03b3 = 0.2 \u00d7 106 K \u2248 0.1T0 and\n\u03b1 = 0, \u00b10.030, \u00b10.060, which were well represented by a fixed value of \u03b2.\nWe find\n\n\u03b2 = \u2212 0.095 =\n\n\u2202 ln RCZ\n,\n\u2202 ln \u03ba\n\n(5)\n\n\u0013\u22120.095\n\n(6)\n\nor, equivalently,\n\u0012\n\nRCZ\nRCZ,0\n\n\u0013\n\n=\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03ba\n\u03ba0\n\n.\n\nSince we have used converged solar models that satisfy the observational constraints\non the luminosity, the chemical composition, and other parameters, the result given in\nequation (6)includes all of the feedback effects required by the boundary conditions and the\nexternal observational constraints.\nTo test the robustness of this result, we doubled the value of \u03b3 to \u03b3 = 0.4 \u00d7 106 K and\nobtained for this broader perturbation a similar value for \u03b2, namely, \u03b2 = \u22120.10 (instead of\n\u22120.095). Of course, we do not know a priori the exact form of any future change in the\nradiative opacity that may result from further research. Nevertheless, we can conclude from\nthe examples we have studied that equation (6) is a good approximation to changes in the\nopacity that are local and peaked at the base of the convection zone.\nThe sign of \u03b2, which is given in equation (5), is evident from physical reasoning. The\nmagnitude of the radiative temperature gradient is proportional to the opacity since the\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nradiative flux passing through a given point in the star is fixed. If the radiative opacity is\nincreased at a fixed point, then the radiative gradient is increased and the condition for\nconvective stability becomes more difficult to satisfy. The star can become convectively\nunstable at a smaller radius (higher temperature).\nThe changes in opacity considered here will necessarily bring about small changes\nin the inferred surface mass fraction of hydrogen. Quantitatively, we find analogous to\nequation (5) that (X/X0 ) = (\u03ba/\u03ba0 )\u22120.023 , i.e. a weak dependence. A change of 20% in\nopacity leads to an estimated change in X of about 0.4%, less than the uncertainties in the\nhelioseismological determinations of X.\n\n2.3.\n\nHow Accurately Do We Need To Know the Opacity?\n\nEquation (5) and equation (6) imply that in order to calculate the depth of the\nconvective zone to the accuracy with which the depth is measured, 1 part in 713, one must\nknow the radiative opacity at the base of the CZ to an accuracy\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2206\u03ba\n\u03ba\n\n\u0013\n\n= 1% .\n\n(7)\n\nequivalent experimental accuracy\n\nThis is extremely high precision for a calculated radiative opacity, probably beyond the\nreach of existing calculations.\nIf we try to explain the difference between the measured value of RCZ (see equation [1])\nand the value calculated using recently determined heavy element abundances (see\nequation [2]), then we find that the opacities used in the solar model must be in error by\n\u0012\n\n\u2206\u03ba\n\u03ba\n\n\u0013\n\n= 21% .\nZ/X = 0.0176\n\nThe result shown in equation (8)applies for the Bahcall and Pinsonneault (2004) solar\n\n(8)\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nmodel BP04. The Garching code leads to a slightly larger discrepancy between calculated\nand measured depth of the convective zone (cf. \u00a7 4).\nWe have evolved a solar model based upon the recent abundance determinations,\nBP04+, but with a 21% increased opacity near the base of the convective zone. The\ncalculated depth of the convective zone is RCZ = 0.7133R\u2299 , in good agreement (by\ndesign) with the measured value. The initial (final, surface) mass fractions for this model\nare: X0 = .71621 (0.74776), Y0 = 0.26919 (0.23908), and Z0 = 0.01460 (0.01316). The\ncurrent surface abundance of Y implied by this model is about 3\u03c3 smaller than the value\ndetermined by Basu and Antia (2004) from helioseismology. We are not sure how to\nregard this discrepancy since the overwhelmingly dominant error in the helioseismological\nvalue is systematic, not statistical. In the forthcoming paper by Bahcall et al. (2004),\nwe will compare the BP04+ solar model with increased opacity with all of the available\nhelioseismological data.\nThe estimate given in equation (8) is based upon the assumption that the opacity is\nchanged only locally, i.e., near the base of the convective zone (see equation [4]). If, instead,\none changes the opacity by changing the surface heavy element abundance, Z/X, then the\nopacity is affected throughout the solar model and the change required near the base of the\nconvective zone can be different. The inputs to the models BP04 and BP04+ of Bahcall\n& Pinsonneault (2004) differ only in the assumed heavy element abundance. BP04+ was\ncalculated assuming Z/X = 0.0176 (recently determined low heavy element abundance)\nand BP04 was calculated using Z/X = 0.0229 (Grevesse & Sauval 1998). Using the results\nobtained from these two models (comparing the calculated difference in the CZ depth\nbetween the two converged solar models with the difference in radiative opacity at same T\nand \u03c1 near the base of the CZ), we estimate that the opacity near the base of the CZ must\nchange by \u2243 14% if the pattern of opacity changes is similar to that induced by composition\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nchanges.\nWe evaluate in the next section the sensitive dependence of the radiative opacity on\nthe assumed surface heavy element abundance.\n\n3.\n\nDependence of Radiative Opacity on Composition\n\nIn this section, we estimate the dependence of the radiative opacity near the base of the\nconvective zone upon the stellar composition. We approximate the opacity as a function of\nthe hydrogen mass fraction, X, and the heavy element mass fraction, Z. Thus \u03ba = \u03ba(X, Z).\nThe fractional uncertainty in the opacity may then be written in the form\n\nd\u03ba\n=\n\u03ba\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2202 ln \u03ba\n\u2202 ln Z\n\n\u0013\n\nX\n\ndZ\n+\nZ\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2202 ln \u03ba\n\u2202 ln X\n\n\u0013\n\nZ\n\ndX\n.\nX\n\n(9)\n\nWe have used the existing OPAL opacity tables to evaluate numerically the fractional\nderivatives that appear in equation (9). We find\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2202 ln \u03ba\n\u2202 ln Z\n\n\u0013\n\n\u2245 0.70 ;\nX\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2202 ln \u03ba\n\u2202 ln X\n\n\u0013\n\n\u2245 0.15 .\n\n(10)\n\nZ\n\nThe numerical values for the logarithmic derivatives given in equation 10 were determined\nfor conditions similar to those at the base of the current solar convective zone; we used\nlog T = 6.34, log \u03c1 = \u22120.7, X = 0.74, and Z = 0.0169. Changing the values of the physical\nvariables at which the derivatives are evaluated causes only small changes in the derivatives\nas long as the changes are restricted to stellar positions close to the base of the convective\nzone.\nThe uncertainty in the opacity is dominated by the uncertainty in the heavy element\nabundance, Z. If we want to know the opacity to 1%, the accuracy required to calculate\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nthe depth of the solar convective zone to the precision with which the depth is measured\n(see equation [7]), then we have to determine the surface heavy element abundance to a\nprecision of 1%. This seems like, at present, an impossibly ambitious demand, at least\nfor the foreseeable future. The current 1\u03c3 uncertainty in Z is about 15% (see Bahcall &\nPinsonneault 2004).\nIn the next two sections, we estimate how accurately the radiative opacity can be\ninterpolated from the existing OPAL opacity tables.\n\n4.\n\nCOMPARISON OF THE RADIATIVE OPACITY OBTAINED FROM\nTWO DIFFERENT INTERPOLATION SCHEMES\nWe compare in this section the radiative opacity values interpolated from standard\n\nOPAL opacity tables by two different interpolation schemes embedded in two extensively\nused state-of-the-art stellar evolution codes. In particular, we interpolate within the\nOPAL tables using a 4-point Lagrangian scheme that is implemented in the Yale/BP\nstellar evolution code (Guenther, Jaffe, & Demarque 1989; Pinsonneault, Kawaler, Sofia, &\nDemarque 1989; Bahcall & Pinsonneault 1992, 1995, 2001) and a bi-rational spline scheme\n(Sp\u00e4th 1995) that is implemented in the Garching code (Schlattl & Weiss 1997).\nThe implementations of these two different interpolation schemes have been extensively\ntested. There is no absolute way to evaluate their accuracy since the precision that\nis obtained depends upon the behavior of the function being interpolated. The two\ninterpolation schemes have different advantages and disadvantages.\nFigure 1 shows the fractional difference, \u03b4\u03ba/\u03ba, between the radiative opacity that is\nobtained using the Yale/BP 4-point Lagrangian scheme and the opacity interpolated using\nthe Garching bi-rational spline scheme (the damping parameter for the bi-rational splines\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\n\nFig. 1.- Fractional Opacity Difference from Two Interpolation Schemes. The figure shows\nthe fractional difference in the opacity, \u03b4\u03ba/\u03ba (in percent) obtained from two interpolation\nschemes embodied in two widely used stellar evolution programs, the Yale/BP code and the\nMPA code. The fractional difference is defined to be \u03b4\u03ba/\u03ba = (Result from bi-rational spline\n\u2212 Result from 4-pt-Lagrangian) / 4-pt-Lagrangian. The figure was made for a fixed T, \u03c1,\nX, Z profile so the differences that are shown are only due to interpolation.\nwas set to 5). The fractional opacity is displayed at different radii (lower horizontal scale)\nand at different temperatures (top horizontal scale) in a standard solar model. The figure\nwas made for a fixed T, \u03c1, X, Z profile so the differences that are shown are only due to\ninterpolation.\nThe amplitude of the difference becomes as large as 4% near the base of the convective\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\nzone, which is denoted by a vertical line in Figure 1. The interpolated value of the opacity\nnear the base of the CZ is particularly sensitive to the interpolation scheme because the\ntemperature of the solar CZ and the value of r = \u03c1/T63 fall about half way between two\npoints at which the OPAL opacity is tabulated.\nThe amplitude of the discrepancy between the two interpolation schemes is much larger\nthan is permitted if one wants to calculate the depth of the CZ to the measured accuracy\n(see equation [7]). The above discussion shows that uncertainties due to interpolation\ncontribute importantly to the error budget for the calculation of the solar convective zone\n(see equation [8]).\n\n5.\n\nSIMULATED OPACITY TABLES: COMPARISON OF INTERPOLATED\nVALUES WITH STANDARD VALUES\nIn this section, we make plausible estimates of the uncertainties inherent in interpolating\n\nthe radiative opacity from the available OPAL opacity tables. We use simulated opacity\ntables to make self-consistency tests of the accuracy of the interpolation schemes we use.\nFor specificity, we cite the results obtained using the bi-rational spline. Similar results were\nfound with the 4-point Lagrangian spline. The inferences obtained in this section regarding\nthe accuracy of interpolation within opacity tables complement and supplement the results\nobtained in \u00a7 4 by comparing the outputs of two different interpolation schemes.\nThe figures that we show are based upon the following strategy. Using the existing\nOPAL opacity tables, we interpolate the value of the opacity at shifted points, making\nin this way new but simulated tables. We then use the simulated tables to predict the\nvalues of the opacity at the original, unshifted points. We take as one measure of the likely\nuncertainty the difference between the opacity values in the original published tables and\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\n\nFig. 2.- Errors in interpolating using shifted opacity. The figure shows the relative opacity differences, \u03b4\u03ba/\u03ba = (\u03bastd \u2212 \u03bashifted )/\u03bastandard , that were found between the interpolated\nopacities that were obtained using the shifted and the standard opacity tables (see text for\nexplanation) as a function of the interpolation variable. Panel a uses the original OPAL\ngrid spacing and compares the results with the values obtained from shifting the tables in\ntemperature (\u2206 log T ). Panel b is analogous to panel a, but the opacity tables are shifted in\nr (defined as r = \u03c1/T63 , shifted in \u2206 log r). The squares denote the location of the tabulated\nvalues in the original OPAL opacity tables. Panels c and d are similar to panels a and\nb, respectively, but with grid spacings reduced by a factor of four. Although the regions\nfor log T < 6.3 (log r > \u22121.5) are inside the convective envelope, they are shown for the\nsake of clarity. In each case, the grid spacing is given, together with the fixed value for the\nother variable. In all cases the hydrogen and metal mass fractions are fixed at X = 0.7 and\nZ = 0.02 respectively.\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\nthe opacity values at the same points obtained by interpolating in the simulated tables.\nIn all cases, the largest errors are expected (and observed) at points originally tabulated\nin OPAL tables because none of the shifted tables (independent of the grid spacing) have\nthese points tabulated. Since the originally tabulated values lay in the middle of the shifted\nintervals, they give the largest errors.\nWe have also tested the accuracy of the interpolation schemes by artificially making the\nOPAL tables more sparse, i.e., by omitting points. We then interpolate in the sparser tables\nto see how well the interpolation reproduces the omitted values. The uncertainty estimates\nobtained using sparser tables are in good agreement with the uncertainties obtained by\nshifting points. We concentrate our discussion here on the results found with the shifted\ntables because these results are more easily displayed.\nFigure 2 shows the fractional differences in the opacity, \u03b4\u03ba/\u03ba, that were found between\nthe values given in the original OPAL tables and the values that were obtained from the\nsimulated shifted tables. The upper two panels in the figure use the actual grid spacing\nof the OPAL tables. The OPAL tables are presented in terms of the logarithm of the\ntemperature (log T ) and the logarithm of r \u2261 \u03c1/T63 (log r).\nFigure 2a and Figure 2b show that the amplitudes of \u03b4\u03ba/\u03ba can be as large as 3% in\ninterpolating within the shifted OPAL tables.\nHow dense does the opacity grid have to be in order that the interpolation uncertainty\nwithin the grid be less than 1% (see equation [7]) for opacities near the base of the CZ? In\norder to provide a plausible answer to this question, we have interpolated within simulated\nopacity tables with grids of a variety of different densities.\nThe lower two panels, Figure 2c and Figure 2d, show the results of interpolations within\nsimulated tables that have grid sizes, respectively, of \u2206 log T = 0.025 and \u2206r = 0.125.\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\nThese simulated tables are four times as dense in each variable as the existing OPAL\nopacity tables. The errors in predicting the unshifted opacity values in the original OPAL\ntables are less than 0.6% (throughout the physically relevant region) when the values in\nthe simulated shifted tables are used. With the simple assumptions we have made, the\nestimated errors scale approximately linearly with the grid spacing. However, this linear\ndependence results in large part from our assumption that the opacity values are smooth in\nlog T and log r in the regions of interest.\nThe situation is somewhat different for the heavy element abundance, Z. The existing\nOPAL opacity tables present values for three heavy element abundances relevant to the Sun:\nZ = 0.01, 0.02, 0.03. However, recent redeterminations of the heavy element abundance in\nthe Sun have suggested that Z is significantly lower than was previously believed (Allende\nPrieto, Lambert, & Asplund 2001, 2002; Asplund et al. 2004; Asplund et al. 2000; Asplund\n2000). We have experimented numerically with interpolating in Z within the existing\nOPAL opacity tables and also within simulated opacity tables with a denser grid in Z. We\nfind that the required accuracy (better than 1%) in interpolation can be achieved if a grid\nwith \u2206Z = 0.0025 is used for values of Z ranging from Z = 0.0100 to Z = 0.0225. This\namounts, in addition to a denser grid, to a shift to lower values in the mean value of Z that\nis tabulated. Fortunately, we find that the existing OPAL grid in the hydrogen abundance,\nX, is sufficient to permit interpolation in the opacity to the required accuracy.\nFigure 3 displays for the points in a standard solar model the expected uncertainties\nin interpolating the radiative opacity within opacity tables that have our preferred grid\nspacings, namely, \u2206 log T = 0.025 and \u2206r = 0.125. In computing the expected uncertainties\nshown in Figure 3, we created simulated OPAL tables at shifted points in all three variables:\nT , r, and Z. We then used the simulated tables to calculate the opacity at points (defined\nby T , r, and Z) that correspond to points in the standard solar model. The opacity\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\n\nFig. 3.- Interpolation uncertainties in a solar model. The figure shows the estimated\nfractional uncertainties, \u03b4\u03ba/\u03ba, in interpolating for a solar model the radiative opacities in\nsimulated opacity tables with a grid size \u2206 log T = 0.025, \u2206 log r = 0.125, and with heavy\nelement composition values ranging from Z = 0.0100 to Z = 0.0225 with \u2206Z = 0.0025. In\nFigure 3, the left panel has \u2206 log T = 0.025 and \u2206 log r = 0.5 (original spacing) and the\nright panel has \u2206 log T = 0.1 (original spacing) and \u2206 log r = 0.125. The opacities obtained\nby interpolating in shifted simulated tables in \u2206 log T , \u2206 log r, and Z are compared with the\nvalues obtained in unshifted simulated tables. The differences \u03b4\u03ba/\u03ba are shown as a function\nof the fractional solar radius, R/R\u2299 . The upper horizontal axis shows the corresponding\nvalues of log T (log r)for the left panel (right panel). The location of the base of the CZ zone\nis shown by a vertical dotted line.\nobtained from shifted simulated tables was compared with the opacity obtained from\nunshifted simulated opacity tables. The differences, \u2206\u03ba/\u03ba, between shifted and unshifted\nsimulated opacities are plotted in Figure 3 as a function of the radial position, R/R\u2299 , in\nthe solar model and also as a function of the corresponding values of either log T or log r.\nThe dotted vertical line indicates the location of the base of the convective zone.\nWe conclude from Figure 2 and Figure 3 that opacity tables with grid sizes of\n\u2206 log T = 0.025 and \u2206r = 0.125 are probably accurate enough to permit a precise\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\ncalculation of the depth of the solar CZ using existing stellar evolution codes. For the\ndense grid sizes considered here, the interpolations within the opacity tables should not\ncause errors that prevent an accurate calculation of the depth of the solar convective\nzone. However, the absolute value of the tabulated radiative opacities could still introduce\nsignificant uncertainties.\n\n6.\n\nSUMMARY AND DISCUSSION\n\nThe primary goal of this paper is to determine how accurately the radiative opacity\nnear the base of the convective zone must be known in order to use measurements of the CZ\ndepth to draw conclusions about other solar parameters. There are two separate but related\nissues with respect to the accuracy of the radiative opacity, namely, the accuracy with\nwhich the tabulated values in opacity tables are calculated and the accuracy with which the\nopacity can be interpolated within tables of a specified grid size. We first summarize our\nconclusions regarding the accuracy of tabulated opacity values and then we summarize our\nresults with respect to the accuracy of interpolations within the standard OPAL opacity\ntables. The helioseismological implications of the opacity changes considered in this paper\nwill be discussed in Bahcall, Basu, Pinsonneault, and Serenelli, (2004, in preparation).\nWe show in \u00a7 2 that the logarithmic derivative of the convective zone depth with\nrespect to the logarithm of the opacity satisfies \u2202 ln RCZ /\u2202 ln \u03ba \u2248 \u22120.095. We conclude from\nthis relation that the radiative opacity must be known to an accuracy of 1% in order to\ncalculate in a solar model the depth of the CZ to the accuracy, 0.14%, with which the depth\nis measured by helioseismology. On the other hand, if one accepts the recent measurements\nof heavy element abundances, then the OPAL opacities must be increased by about 21%\nin order to reconcile the calculated solar model depth of the CZ and the measured depth\nof the CZ. This change of 21% could conceivably arise from a combination of errors in\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\nthe tabulated values of the opacity and interpolation errors, which are discussed below.\nHowever, as we shall see, the total change of 21% is too large to be ascribed solely to errors\nin interpolation.\nIt would be very instructive to have a comprehensive study of the absolute accuracy\nof state-of-the-art radiative opacity calculations. A detailed comparison of the calculated\nopacity near the base of the convective zone obtained by the Opacity Project (Seaton,\nYan, Mihalis, & Pradhan 1994) with the results of the OPAL project (Iglesias & Rogers\n1996) would be very informative. The interested reader is referred to the informative and\ninsightful comparison by Neuforge-Verheecke et al. (2001) of the Los Alamos LEDCOP\nopacities and the OPAL opacities. The largest differences are found near the base of the\nconvective zone, with the OPAL opacities being as much as 6% larger than the LEDCOP\nopacities in this region. As part of a comprehensive discussion of factors that affect the\naccuracy of solar models, Boothroyd & Sackmann (2003) have investigated ways that the\nopacities can affect helioseismological parameters.\nWe show in \u00a7 3 that the radiative opacity near the base of the convective zone\ndepends sensitively upon the assumed chemical composition (see especially equation 9 and\nequation 10). If one wanted to calculate the depth to an accuracy of 0.6%, then one would\nneed to know the heavy element mass fraction, Z, to an accuracy of 1%. This precision is\nfar beyond the current state-of-the-art accuracy in the determination of the heavy element\nabundance.\nThe entire difference between the measured depth of the solar convective zone\n(equation 1) and the value calculated using a solar model with the recent low\ndeterminations of the heavy element abundances (equation 2) could be explained by the\npresent uncertainty, \u223c 15%, in the ratio of Z/X (see Bahcall & Pinsonneault 2004). Of\ncourse, the changes in opacity caused by changing Z/X are not limited to any particular\n\n\f\u2013 23 \u2013\nregion. Changing the assumed surface value of Z/X affects the composition and hence the\nopacity throughout the solar model.\nWe have approximated in this paper the dependence of the opacity upon composition\nby the dependence upon just two variables, the mass fractions X and Z. In reality, the\nsituation is more complex. Different chemical elements contribute differently to the stellar\nopacity. For example, Bahcall, Pinsonneault, and Basu (2001) found that the depth of\nthe convective zone was most sensitive to the abundances of the lighter metals, which are\nsignificant opacity sources at 2 \u00d7 106 K, while the heavier metals were much more important\nfor the core structure and the estimated initial solar helium abundance. However, we are\nnot yet at a level of precision that we can specify well the opacity-weighted uncertainties\nof the different heavy elements. This is a refinement that will have to await further\nprogress in determining the different heavy element abundances and more extensive opacity\ncalculations.\nWe compare in \u00a7 4 the radiative opacity values obtained with two different interpolation\nroutines from the standard OPAL opacity tables. We find that the difference in interpolated\nvalues of the radiative opacity can be as large as 4% near the base of the convective zone.\nWe also tested in \u00a7 5 the accuracy with which interpolations can be performed within\nsimulated opacity tables of different grid sizes. We find that errors of the order of 3% may\nbe expected from tables with the grid spacings of the existing OPAL tables. However, we\nshow that the interpolation uncertainties could be reduced to the level of 1% or below\nby using a denser grid with \u2206 log T = 0.025, \u2206 log r = 0.125, and with Z ranging from\nZ = 0.0100 to Z = 0.0225 with \u2206Z = 0.0025.\nFor completeness, we report in the Appendix on the calculated depth of the CZ that\nwas found using four different equations of state. In agreement with other authors, we find\nthat the choice of equation of state affects the calculated depth of the CZ by only about\n\n\f\u2013 24 \u2013\n\u00b10.1 %. We also show in the Appendix that current uncertainties in nuclear reaction rates\nalso affect the calculated depth of the convective zone at the level of 0.1%.\n\nJNB and AMS are supported in part by NSF grant PHY0070928 to the Institute\nfor Advanced Study.

In addition to the OPAL 1996 EOS, we have used an updated version of\nthe OPAL EOS (OPAL 2001; Rogers 2001), the MHD EOS (Mihalas, D\u00e4ppen, & Hummer\n1988) and the IRWIN EOS.(Cassisi, Salaris, & Irwin 2003)\nTable 2 summarizes our results. The variation in the calculated depth of the convective\nzone due to varying the assumed equation of state is\n\u2206RCZ\n\u2243 0.001 .\nRCZ\n\n(A1)\n\nThis variation is similar to the quoted uncertainty in the measured depth of the convective\nzone (see equation [1]), but much smaller than the change in the calculated RCZ required\nto obtain consistency with the new, lower heavy element abundances (see equation [2]).\nSimilar results have been found previously by other authors (Schlattl 2002; Basu, D\u00e4ppen,\n& Nayfonov 1999), who used, however, the larger value of (Z/X)\u2299 = 0.0245.\nWe therefore conclude that the pressure-temperature-density relationship from the\n\n\f\u2013 25 \u2013\n\nTable 2: Depth of the convection zone in solar radius for different EOS.\nEOS\n\nRbce /R\u2299\n\nOPAL 1996\n\n0.7155\n\nOPAL 2001\n\n0.7157\n\nMHD\n\n0.7164\n\nIRWIN\n\n0.7146\n\nequation of state is not a major component of the overall error budget for the depth of\nthe solar surface convection zone. However, the ionization balance of heavy elements as a\nfunction of the physical conditions can have a significant impact on the opacities; in this\nindirect sense, the equation of state will have an impact on the problem.\n\nB.\n\nHow much effect do nuclear reactions have on the calculated depth of the\nconvective zone?\nFor completeness, we record here the small effect that the rates of nuclear reactions have\n\non the calculated depth of the solar convective zone. In Table 1 of Bahcall and Pinsonneault\n(2004), the neutrino fluxes are listed for two models, BP00 and New Nuclear, that differ\nonly in the adopted nuclear reactions. The New Nuclear model was computed using the\nbest-estimate nuclear rates as of the end of 2003, while the model BP00 was computed using\nthe best rates available in 2000. The computed depths for the convective zone are 0.7140R\u2299\n(for BP00) and 0.7147R\u2299 (for New Nuclear). Thus, the current uncertainties in the nuclear\nreaction rates affect the calculated depth of the solar convective zone at the level of 0.1%.\n\n\f\u2013 26 \u2013\nC.\n\nThe conversion of carbon and oxygen to nitrogen during CNO burning\n\nDuring the course of CNO burning, nearly all of 12 C and a fraction of 16 O are converted\nto\n\n14\n\nN (for the earliest discussion of this process, see Section II.C.2 of Bahcall and Ulrich\n\n1988 and also Section III.A of Bahcall and Pinsonneault 1992). This process increases\nslightly (decreases slightly) the heavy element (hydrogen) mass fraction since, for example,\ntwo protons are added to\n\n12\n\nC to make\n\n14\n\nUnfortunately, the enhancement of\n\nN.\n\n14\n\nN at the expenses of hydrogen cannot be exactly\n\ntaken into account with the existing OPAL opacity tables. The existing tables do not allow\nthe selective enhancement of nitrogen.\nWe have therefore evolved two different solar models with two different treatments\nof the\n\n14\n\nN enhancement. In the first model, the enhancement is taken into account and\n\nabsorbed into the total heavy element abundance, Z. This treatment correctly accounts\nfor the increase in Z and the decrease of X when calculating the opacities but, incorrectly,\nspreads the increased heavy element abundance among all of the metals according to their\ninitial relative abundances. Thus, the solar interior opacity is slightly overestimated. In the\nsecond model, we completely ignored the increase in Z due to the conversion of carbon and\noxygen into nitrogen when computing the opacities. In this case, the solar interior opacity\nis slightly underestimated.\nFortunately, the fractional difference is only 0.1% for the computed depth of the solar\nconvective zone obtained with these two different approximations.\n\n\f\u2013 27 \u2013\nREFERENCES\nAlexander, D.
