We study, using direct orbit integrations, the kinematic response of the outer stellar disk to the presence\nof a central bar, as in the Milky-Way. We find that the bar's outer Lindblad resonance (OLR) causes significant\nperturbations of the velocity moments. With increasing velocity dispersion, the radius of these perturbations is\nshifted outwards, beyond the nominal position of the OLR, but also the disk becomes less responsive. If we follow\nDehnen (2000) in assuming that the OLR occurs just inside the Solar circle and that the Sun lags the bar major\naxis by \u223c 20\u25e6 , we find (1) no significant radial motion of the local standard of rest (LSR), (2) a vertex deviation\nof \u223c 10\u25e6 and (3) a lower ratio \u03c322 /\u03c312 of the principal components of the velocity-dispersion tensor than for an\nunperturbed disk. All of these are actually consistent with the observations of the Solar-neighbourhood kinematics.\nThus it seems that at least the lowest-order deviations of the local-disk kinematics from simple expectations based\non axisymmetric equilibrium can be attributed entirely to the influence of the Galactic bar.\nKey words.

Introduction\nSeveral observations since the 1980s have shown beyond\nany doubt that the Milky Way is actually a barred galaxy.\nAlthough there is strong evidence that bars in galaxies\nare confined to regions within the radius RCR of the corotation resonance (CR), a bar may nonetheless influence\nthe outer parts of its host galaxy, most obviously by resonant phenomena. It has been shown by Dehnen (2000)\nand Fux (2001) that if the Sun is just outside the OLR\nsuch influence can explain the so-called u-anomaly. The\nlatter is a bi-modality in the local velocity distribution of\nold stars, that has been inferred from HIPPARCOS data\n(Dehnen, 1998).\nThe galactic bar might also have some relevance in explaining the vertex deviation. This is the mis-alignment\nof the local velocity dispersion ellipsoid with respect to\nthe local radial direction in the Galaxy and vanishes for\nany axisymmetric stellar dynamical equilibrium. Using\nHIPPARCOS data, the vertex deviation has been shown\n(Dehnen & Binney, 1998) to reach as high as 30\u25e6 for young\nstellar populations, and to be \u223c 10\u25e6 for the old ones.\nWhereas the high vertex deviation of the young populations is most probably due to moving groups, i.e. deviations from dynamical equilibrium, and thus in a sense\naccidental (Binney & Merrifield, 1998), there should be\nSend offprint requests to: W. Dehnen\n\ndynamical reasons for its occurrence with the old populations, i.e. deviations from axisymmetry.\nAnother anomaly in the stellar kinematics observed\nin the Solar neighbourhood that may also be related to\nthe bar's influence is the low value for the ratio \u03c322 /\u03c312 of\nthe principal components of the velocity-dispersion tensor\nof only 0.42+0.06\n\u22120.04 for old stellar populations (Dehnen &\nBinney, 1998). For a flat rotation curve for the Milky Way\nand in the limit of vanishing velocity dispersion, epicycle\ntheory gives a lower limit of 0.5 for this ratio and the\nactual expectations from axisymmetric models are \u2248 0.6\n(Evans & Collett, 1993; Dehnen, 1999), significantly inconsistent with the data.\nIn the present work, we will follow the approach of\nDehnen (2000) further by investigating the velocity distribution in its spatial variability. Our primary interest is in\nthe low-order moments of this distribution, i.e. the mean\n(streaming) velocity and velocity dispersion. In particular,\nwe want to quantify whether the influence of the Galactic\nbar may explain the aforementioned anomalies, the vertex\ndeviation and velocity-dispersion axis ratio, observed for\nthe old stellar populations. Our approach applies to the\nkinematics in the solar neighbourhood, while at the same\ntime it constitutes a completely general analysis of the bar\ninfluence in a stellar disk.\nThe outline of the paper is as follows: In Sect. 2 we will\ndescribe our simulations, Sect. 3 gives a rather technical\n\n\f2\n\nG. M\u00fchlbauer and W. Dehnen: Kinematic response of the outer stellar disk to a central bar\n\npresentation of the results, and Sect. 4 concludes the paper\nby a discussion of the results.\n\n2. Simulation of Bar Influence\nSince we do not want to construct a self-consistent model\nof the Galaxy, we just study the stellar dynamics for a\nsimple model potential. In order to arrive at (stationary)\nequilibrium, we slowly add to the underlying axisymmetric\nGalactic potential the non-axisymmetric component of the\nbar (the bar monopole is assumed to be already accounted\nfor by the Galactic potential). We do not pay very much\nattention to the inner parts (inside co-rotation), and we\nneglect influences of vertical motion, so our model is twodimensional. The calculation consists of orbit integration\nof a large ensemble of phase-space points representing the\ninitial equilibrium. This numerical technique, which may\nbe called restricted N -body method, is equivalent to firstorder perturbation theory, since the self-gravity due to\nthe wake induced by the perturbation (bar) is neglected.\nAfter the orbit integrations, the velocity moments at certain times are computed from the phase-space positions\nof the trajectories.\n\n2.1. Sampling\n\nnamely:\n\nThe sampling of the initial phase-space points is done as\ndescribed in Dehnen (1999), using the distribution function (eq. (10) in Dehnen, 1999).\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u03a9(RE )[L \u2212 Lc (RE )]\n\u03a9(RE ) \u03a3(RE )\n,\nexp\nf (E, L) =\n\u03c0\u03ba(RE ) \u03c3 2 (RE )\n\u03c3 2 (RE )\n(1)\nwhere \u03a9(R), \u03ba(R), and Lc (R) are the azimuthal and epicycle frequency and angular momentum of the circular orbit\nat radius R, while RE is the radius of the circular orbit\nwith energy E. With this choice for the distribution function, the collisionless Boltzmann equation is satisfied at\nt = 0 (since f depends only on the integrals of motion E\nand L) and the surface density and radial velocity dispersion of the disk follow approximately (for a quantitative\ncomparison, see Dehnen, 1999, and also Fig. 3) those given\nwith the parameter functions \u03a3(R) and \u03c3(R), respectively.\nHere, we assume exponentials for both of them:\n\u03a3(R) = \u03a30 e(R0 \u2212R)/R\u03a3 ,\n\nFig. 1. Geometry of the rotation of the galaxy and definition\nof coordinate system. Note that positive values of radial velocity u are taken to point inwards and that azimuth angle \u03c6\nis measured from the bar axis in the mathematically positive\nsense, but against the direction of bar rotation (modulo 180\u25e6 ).\nAlso shown is a velocity dispersion ellipsoid with its principal\ncomponents \u03c31 and \u03c32 and a (positive) vertex deviation lv .\n\n\u03c3(R) = \u03c30 e(R0 \u2212R)/R\u03c3 . (2)\n\nIf not stated otherwise, we choose R\u03c3 = R0 and R\u03a3 =\n0.33R0 by standard, R0 being the distance of the Sun from\nthe galactic center. If not stated otherwise, \u03c30 = 0.2v0 ,\nwhere v0 is the circular velocity at R0 . In this way, samples\nof K = 107 initial phase-space points are created.\n\n2.2. Model Potential and Orbit Integration\nOrbit integration and adiabatic growth of a quadrupole\nbar is done similarly to Dehnen (2000). The galactic background potential is chosen to give a power law in the velocity curve\n\u03b2\nvc (R) = v0 (R/R0 ) ,\n(3)\n\n\u03a60 (R) =\n\n(\n\n(2\u03b2)\u22121 v02 (R/R0 )\nv02\n\nln (R/R0 )\n\n2\u03b2\n\nfor\n\n\u03b2 6= 0\n\nfor\n\n\u03b2=0\n\n(4)\n\nFor the bar potential \u03a61 = \u03a61 (R, \u03c6, t), we only use a\nquadrupole, since higher poles are much less important\nat large radii, following Dehnen (2000):\n(\n2 \u2212 (R/Rb )3\nfor R \u2264 Rb\n\u03a61 = \u2212Ab (t) cos 2\u03c6 \u00d7\n(5)\n3\n(Rb /R)\nfor R > Rb\nwhere Rb is the size of the bar. The angle \u03c6 is defined in\nthe frame rotating at pattern speed \u03a9b (see Fig. 1). The\nstrength Ab of the bar is increased from 0 to a value Af\nduring time 0 < t < t1 according to\n\u0012\n\u0013\n3 5 5 3 15\nt\n1\nAb (t) = Af\n, \u03be =2 \u22121\n\u03be \u2212 \u03be + \u03be+\n16\n8\n16\n2\nt1\n(6)\nand stays constant at Ab = Af after t1 . With this functional form, \u03a61 and its first and second time derivative are\ncontinuous, thus representing adiabatic growth of the bar\nand ensuring a smooth transition. The final bar strength\nAf is controlled via the dimensionless model parameter\n\u03b10 = \u03b1(R0 ) with\n\u0012 \u00133\nAf Rb\n\u03b1(R) = 3 2\n,\n(7)\nv0\nR\n\nwhich is the ratio of the forces due to \u03a61 and \u03a60 at galactocentric radius R > Rb on the bar's major axis. Our standard choice is \u03b10 = 0.01, which is consistent with the data\nfor the Milky Way.\nOrbit integration is performed in the co-rotating frame\nup to a time t2 > t1 using a 5th order integrator. In contrast to Dehnen (2000), we integrate forward in time.\n\n\fG. M\u00fchlbauer and W. Dehnen: Kinematic response of the outer stellar disk to a central bar\n\n3\n\n2.3. Calculation of Velocity Moments\nThe (p, q)th moment of the velocity distribution at position r is defined as\nZ\nMpq (r, t) =\ndu dv up v q f (t, x = r, v)\n(8a)\nZ\n=\ndx dv \u03b4(r \u2212 x) up v q f (t, x, v)\n(8b)\nwith v \u2261 (u, v), where u and v denote, respectively,the\nradial and azimuthal velocity component (see Fig. 1). We\ndo not know the value f (t, x, v) of the distribution function at any time t > 0, but instead have a representative sample {xk (t), v k (t)} of phase-space points. Hence,\nwe compute the moment integral (8b) via Monte-Carlo\nintegration, resulting in\n\u0013\n\u0012\nMtot X 1\n|xk \u2212 r|\nMpq (r, t) =\nupk vkq .\nw\nK\n\u01eb2k\n\u01ebk\n\n(9)\n\nk\n\nwhere we have replaced the \u03b4 function in Eq. (8b) by\n\u01eb\u22122\nk w(|xk \u2212 r|/\u01ebk ) with the weight function\nw(d) =\n\n2\n(1 \u2212 d2 ) \u03b8(1 \u2212 d2 ),\n\u03c0\n\n(10)\n\nwhere \u03b8 is the Heaviside function. The parameter \u01ebk gives\nthe radius over which the kth trajectory contributes to the\nmoment integrals. We adjusted \u01ebk such that a constant\nnumber of sampled orbits was expected to fall in the area\nof radius \u01ebk centered on xk by the assumed exponential\nsurface brightness distribution of the disk.\nIn practice, the zeroth, first and second moments are\nestimated in this way and the mean velocities and velocity dispersion tensor1 are then evaluated from \u03bcpq \u2261\n2\nMpq /M00 as \u016b = \u03bc10 , v\u0304 = \u03bc01 and \u03c3uu\n= \u03bc20 \u2212 \u03bc210 ,\n2\n2\n2\n\u03c3vv = \u03bc02 \u2212 \u03bc01 , \u03c3uv = \u03bc11 \u2212 \u03bc10 \u03bc01 .\nOnce the orbit integration is done, one can easily\nswitch to a model with initial distribution function f1 6= f\nby weighting each orbit with the ratio f1 /f , which accounts for the fact that the trajectories were actually\nsampled from f . However, for this method to be useful,\nthe ratio f1 /f must not become too large, because otherwise the moment estimates are dominated by a few orbits with large weights. Since, by virtue of the collisionless Boltzmann equation, the values of the distribution\nfunctions are conserved along trajectories, the ratio f1 /f\nis conserved, too, and can be evaluated at time t = 0,\nfor which the distribution functions can be computed via\nEq. (1). In this way, we did a switch to exponential disks\nwith velocity dispersions \u03c30 < 0.2v0 (the value of the sampling distribution function), such that f1 /f \u2264 [0.2v0 /\u03c30 ]2\n(this follows from Eq.

Models shown have\nROLR /R0 = 0.8 (squares) and ROLR /R0 = 0.92 (triangles),\nand usual (filled) or long integration time (open).

In addition, the\nvalue for the sampled starting distribution at t = 0 is shown,\nindicating the noise level.\n\n2.4. Fourier Components of Velocity Moments\nIn order to most easily follow the evolution of the disk, it is\nuseful to do a Fourier transform on the azimuthal angle \u03c6.\nWe apply this to the mean velocities and dispersion tensor\nelements after we calculated these in the usual way (9),\nexcept that this time we do not use a weighting function,\nbut take bins in R and \u03c6 to make sure every calculated\ntrajectory contributes to the final result. We use a discrete\nFourier transform of the following kind:\ncm =\nsm\n\nN\n2 X\nf (\u03c6j ) cos m\u03c6j ,\nN j=1\n\nN\n2 X\nf (\u03c6j ) sin m\u03c6j ,\n=\nN j=1\n\n(11)\n\nwhere \u03c6j = j\u03c0/N . This gives an approximate Fourier expansion\nn\u22121\nX\ncn\nc0\n(cm cos m\u03c6 + sm sin m\u03c6),\n+\ncos n\u03c6 +\n2\n2\nm=1\n(12)\nwhere n = N/2 and N is supposed to be even. This has\nbeen done for N = 32 in 25 radial bins.\nWe also construct an estimate of the surface density \u03a3\nby dividing the number of sampled orbits per bin by the\nsegment area of the bin, and apply the Fourier transform\nto this quantity as well.\n\nf (\u03c6) \u2248\n\n\f4\n\nG.

Fourier Analysis\n\nWe employ a bootstrap method: the calculations leading\nfrom the data set of every radial bin to its Fourier coefficients are redone for arbitrary subsamples of this data set.\nThe rms scatter in the outcome of many such calculations\ngives a measure of the error.\n\nSince we have an azimuthal m = 2 symmetry, all coefficients of odd index m are expected to vanish, what they\ndo within their errors. Furthermore, in the undeveloped\nstate before bar growth, all coefficients except those with\nm = 0 are, by construction, zero within their errors.\n\n2.6. Symmetries and the Question of Stationarity\n\n3.1.1. The m = 0 Components:\n\nIn order to check, whether or how far our distributions\nhave reached a stationary equilibrium state, we employ a\nsymmetry consideration. As noted by Fux (2001), velocity\ndistributions in an m = 2 symmetric potential have a\nsymmetry\n\nThe dashed lines in Fig. 3 represent the initial axisymmetric case, which shows an exponential decline of \u03a3 as\nwell as in the diagonal components of velocity dispersion\ntensor. The mean azimuthal motion deviates from the circular speed v0 by the asymmetric drift, which is stronger\nfor large \u03c30 , as expected. The mean radial motion vanishes, as required for any stationary model.\nThe solid lines in Fig. 3 show the radial run of the\nm = 0 components in the barred case. Apart from the\n2\ncomponents for \u016b and \u03c3uv\n, which have to vanish for stationary models, some signs of perturbation are visible, the\nstronger the smaller \u03c30 .\nFirst of all, we learn that dispersive effects are quite\nefficient in drawing resonance-induced features away from\nthe actual position of the resonance. Whereas for small\nvelocity dispersion the association of the features with the\nOLR at ROLR = 0.92R0 is clearly visible, they appear in\nthe high dispersion case at a radial range of 1.1 to 1.4R0 ,\nwhere naively one would not attribute them to the OLR.\nIn particular, we have a bump in the v\u0304-curve outside\nof OLR, which becomes more explicit with decreasing dispersion while roughly keeping its absolute magnitude. In\ncontrast to this, the asymmetric drift as the dominant deviation of v\u0304 from the nominal rotation velocity v0 diminishes with decreasing dispersion. There is a similar bump\n2\n2\nin \u03c3uu\n, whereas we have a two-fold feature in \u03c3vv\n.\nMost of the perturbative features in the m = 0 components are induced by the opposite orientation of the\nnear-circular orbits on either side of the resonance.\n\nf (R, \u03c6, u, v) = f (R, \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c6, \u2212u, v),\n\n(13)\n\nwhich is a consequence of the azimuthal m = 2 symmetry\nand the time-reversal symmetry of stellar dynamics in conjunction with stationarity of the distribution function. We\ncan turn this argument around and use the degree of symmetry as a measure for stationarity. A quantitative measure of the symmetry can be obtained in the obvious way\nby subtracting corresponding distribution function values\nover a grid in phase space and doing a quadratic sum over\nthe grid points. Results of this kind of analysis are shown\nin Fig. 2. As can be seen, the simulations show only a\nsmall increase in asymmetry of 15% above the noise level\n(as given by the initial state as well as a very long-time\nsimulation), and this is dropping rapidly after bar growth\nis finished.\n\n3. Results\nKuijken & Tremaine (1991) gave an analytical expression\nfor the behaviour of the mean velocities under the influence of a non-axisymmetric perturbation of multipole order m in a linear approximation.

For\na flat rotation curve, \u03a9 = v0 /R. In our range of interest,\nEqs. (14) are dominated by a pole at the OLR.\nThe results of our simulation, presented below, agree\nroughly with these expectations: the mean velocities show\nmodulations \u016b \u221d sin 2\u03c6, v\u0304 \u221d cos 2\u03c6. The sign of the modulations varies with radius, sign changes should indicate\nresonances. For the dispersion tensor the situation is similar: the off-diagonal component shows a sin 2\u03c6 perturbation, the diagonal components a cos 2\u03c6.\n\nBecause of the symmetry of the problem, we expect the\nm = 2 components to be the dominant ones. As for every\nm > 0, we have one more degree of freedom here, since\nwe have a cosine- and a sine-component (see Fig. 4), or\nequivalently, an amplitude and a phase.\n2\nThe cosine-terms of \u016b and \u03c3uv\nas well as the sine terms\n2\n2\nof \u03a3, v\u0304, \u03c3uu , and \u03c3vv vanish (within their error), which is\nto be expected from Eq. (13) for a stationary model. The\nbehaviour of the remaining non-vanishing terms agrees\nroughly with the expectation from simple linear theory,\ncf. Eq. (14). However, there are two significant deviations.\nFirst, as \u03c30 increases (from left to right panels in Fig. 4),\nthe resonant features are shifted away from ROLR to larger\nradii and are also somewhat smoothed out. Second, there\nis an additional feature at R \u223c 0.6R0 , in particular, for\nv\u0304. When inspecting the orbits of stars dominating at this\n\n\fG. M\u00fchlbauer and W.

Results for models with initial \u03c30 = 0.05v0 , 0.1v0 and 0.2v0 are shown in the\nleft, middle and right panels, respectively. Velocities are given in units of v0 and \u03a3 in arbitrary units. The model shown has an\nOLR-radius of 0.92R0 , corresponding to a CR of 0.539R0 (dashed vertical lines).\n\nradius, we find that many belong to an orbit family associated with the stable Lagrange points L4 and L5 , see Fig.\n5. These orbits can reach radii far beyond co-rotation and,\nin a frame co-rotating with the bar, perform a retrograde\nmotion around the Lagrange points. They thus result in a\nreduced v\u0304 at azimuths perpendicular to the bar and hence\nlead to a positive cos 2\u03c6 component.\n\n3.1.3. Higher-Order Components\nThe m = 4 components are usually smaller by at least\na factor 3 compared to the m = 2 modes, but they are\n\nsignificantly different from zero. In contrast, the analytical\nmodel (14) had no excitation of higher modes at all, since\nmode coupling is not included in a linear approximation.\nThe excitation of the m = 4 modes follows the overall\npattern seen in the m = 2 case: in accordance with the\n2\nsymmetry requirements, we have a sin(4\u03c6) in u and \u03c3uv\n,\nand a cos(2\u03c6) in all the other components. Our signal-tonoise ratio is in the range of about 3 for the m = 4 case,\nand less for higher components, so surely the significance\nof our model is petering out. Nevertheless, some m = 8\nmodes do seem to be discernible still.\n\n\f6\n\nG. M\u00fchlbauer and W.

Variation of Parameters\nDoubling the bar strength leads to a doubling of the magnitude of the effects. This is true for the differences between the undeveloped and final state as well as for Fourier\ncoefficients.\nChanging the bar size, i.e. the parameter Rb in (5),\nproduces some local variations in the magnitude of the\neffects, but it does not shift them in location. Of course,\nthis is to be expected if the location is determined by\nresonance conditions.\nVariation of the disk scale length does not seem to\nhave any strong effects, which is to be expected, since it\n\nonly slightly affects the sampling of the orbits but not the\ndynamics.\n\nThe shape of the velocity curve has a mild effect: we\ntried models with a slightly rising (\u03b2 = 0.1) or falling\n(\u03b2 = \u22120.1) velocity profile, and found very similar results\nas for \u03b2 = 0. (Note that we kept the OLR radius fixed, so\nmodels with different velocity profiles have different rotation frequencies of the bar.) This is expected, too, since\n\u03b2 essentially controls the distances between various resonances (growing wider for larger \u03b2), while most of our\nresults are dominated by a single resonance, the OLR.\n\n\fG.

Thus, the deviation of \u03c322 /\u03c312 from Oort's\nvalue may be decomposed into a velocity-dispersion dependent term, which consists of a general elevation of only\nmild radial dependence and a bar-induced term, which\nvaries spatially and appears to be negative for the Solar\nposition.\nAs a consequence, for mildly warm stellar disks (\u03c3 <\n\u223c\n0.2v0 ), the ratio \u03c322 /\u03c312 in the Solar neighbourhood may\nwell drop below Oort's value.\n\n3.4.

In our model, a considerable fraction\nof stars is trapped in orbits of this family, resulting in the\nsomewhat peculiar run of the velocity moments (Fig. 4).\n\n3.3. The Axis Ratio of the Velocity Ellipsoid\nFig. 6 shows the ratio of the principal axes of the velocity\n2\ndispersion ellipsoid, i.e. the eigenvalues \u03c31,2\nof the tensor\n2\n\u03c3 . For a flat rotation curve, this ratio is often expected\nto be 0.5.

This relation is often\ngiven without the limit and then referred to as Oort's\nrelation. It is, however, important to note that the error\nin Oort's relation is considerable already for \u03c30 = 0.2v0\n(Evans & Collett, 1993; Dehnen, 1999), which means that\nusing it for the old stellar disk of the Milky Way is, at best,\ndangerous. This can be seen clearly from Fig. 6 showing\nthat \u03c322 /\u03c312 for the unperturbed case (dotted) significantly\ndeviates from 0.5 for a warm stellar disk (\u03c30 = 0.2v0 ).\nAfter formation of the bar perturbation, we have large\nvariations in this quantity. For \u03c30 = 0.2v0 and at R =\nR0 , the values are generally somewhat higher than Oort's\nvalue 0.5 but smaller than for an undisturbed disk. For\ndirections that are roughly along the bar (\u03c6 \u223c 0), this\nratio rises sharply just outside the solar circle to values\nreaching as high as 0.8.\nIt is instructive to take a look at the same quantities\nfor a smaller velocity dispersion of \u03c30 = 0.05v0 or 0.1v0\n(left and middle panels of Fig. 6). First of all, the axis ratio\nin the undisturbed case (dashed line in the right panels)\nis much closer to Oort's value of 0.5 here, as expected.\nGenerally, the observed features have smaller width, i.e.\n\n2\u03c3 2\n1\narctan 2 uv 2\n2\n\u03c3uu \u2212 \u03c3vv\n\n(16)\n\nis the angle between the direction of the largest velocity\ndispersion and the line to the Galactic center, see also Fig.\n1. For axisymmetric equilibrium models, lv = 0.\nIn Fig. 7, we plot lv , computed from Fourier coefficients up to m = 2 only in order to eliminate short-scale\nfluctuations. We find that the bar-induced vertex deviation decreases with increasing velocity dispersion from up\nto \u223c 30\u25e6 for \u03c30 = 0.05v0 to 5\u25e6 \u2013 10\u25e6 for \u03c30 = 0.2v0 . In\nthe direction of the bar and perpendicular to it, lv = 0,\nas expected from symmetry. For moderately warm stellar\ndisks (\u03c30 >\n\u223c 0.1v0 ) the vertex deviation at azimuth angles\nbetween 0\u25e6 and 90\u25e6 (including the Solar azimuth) is positive at and inside the solar circle and negative for some\nrange outside. The actual radius where the sign change\noccurs is obviously coupled to the OLR, but again shifted\nto the outside. For a cold stellar disk, the bar-induced vertex deviation displays are more complicated pattern and\nmay reach as high as 40\u25e6 .\nObviously, the vertex deviation is antisymmetric with\nrespect to \u03c6 7\u2192 (\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c6), whereas the velocity dispersion axis ratio is symmetric.

Discussion\nWe have studied the bar-induced variations of the mean\nvelocities and velocity dispersions in the outer disk of a\nbarred galaxy with special emphasis on the situation in\nthe Milky Way. We generally find that these variations\nare largest near the outer Lindblad resonance (OLR), the\napparent radius of which, however, may be shifted outwards by 10-20% due to the non-circularity of the orbits\nin a warm stellar disk.\nRadial motions \u016b of standards of rest can be seen to\noccur quite frequently (see Fig. 8), and can reach magnitudes of the order of about 0.02v0 , corresponding to about\n5 km s\u22121 for the Milky Way. Because of the sin 2\u03c6 dependence, these would be maximal at \u03c6 = 45\u25e6 , which is quite\n\n\f8\n\nG. M\u00fchlbauer and W. Dehnen: Kinematic response of the outer stellar disk to a central bar\n\nFig. 6. Axis ratio \u03c322 /\u03c312 of the principal components of the velocity-dispersion tensor for the final (solid ) and the initial\nunperturbed state (dashed ) at various azimuths for the models with ROLR = 0.92R0 and \u03c30 of 0.05v0 (left), 0.1v0 (middle), and\n0.2v0 (right)\n\nnear the proposed position of the Sun of \u03c6 \u2248 30\u25e6 . In its\nradial dependence however, \u016b swings through zero shortly\noutside of the OLR, and it may well be that the Sun just\nmeets that point. So we cannot give a definite prediction\nfor the bar-induced radial motion of the LSR here, not\neven by sign only, except that it should be very small (at\nmost a few km s\u22121 ).\nVariations of the mean azimuthal velocity are also\npresent, but here we have to deal with several perturbation\neffects, the dominant one for realistic cases being traditional axisymmetric asymmetric drift. We can construct a\npicture of the bar-induced v\u0304-modifications only (see Fig.\n\n8) by subtracting v\u0304 in the undeveloped case before bar\ngrowth, thus also canceling asymmetric drift. However,\nthis is, of course, impossible for real galaxies, where only\nthe combination of circular speed (LSR motion), asymmetric drift, and bar induced drift is measurable (in principle). In observational data, the effect of asymmetric drift\ncan be corrected for, as done by Dehnen & Binney (1998),\nby calculating v\u0304 for stellar populations with different velocity dispersions and extrapolating to vanishing dispersion. This approach, however, cannot be applied to the\nbar-induced perturbations in v\u0304, since, as can be seen in\nFig. 3, the relative magnitude of the bar-induced wiggle\n\n\fG.

The highly uncertain outliers at R \u223c 1.2R0 ,\n\u03c6 = 0\u25e6 for \u03c30 = 0.1v0 are caused by a near-circular velocity ellipsoid (\u03c31 \u223c \u03c32 , see Fig. 6), which renders the vertex deviation\nill-defined.\n\nkeeps constant at about 2%, independent of velocity dispersion. So, as long as only local measurements are available, there is no way to discern the bar-induced azimuthal\nvelocity perturbations from variations in the background\nrotation curve, and so it will be rather hard to draw any\nobservational constraints from the mean azimuthal velocities.\nFor an axisymmetric equilibrium, the no vertex deviation, i.e. lv = 0, is expected, while in the Solar neighbourhood lv is observed to drop from lv \u2248 30\u25e6 for blue\nto \u2248 10\u25e6 for red main-sequence stars (Dehnen & Binney,\n1998). The traditional interpretation of these vertex deviations is that young stars deviate from equilibrium, and\n\nthus even in an axisymmetric galaxy give rise to lv 6= 0,\nwhich due to the decreasing number of young stars at later\nstellar types is a decreasing function of stellar colour.\nOur calculations show that for an equilibrium in a\nbarred Milky Way, with bar orientation, strength and pattern speed consistent with other data, a vertex deviation\nof the size and direction as observed emerges naturally.\nMoreover, we also found that for dynamically cooler subpopulations, i.e. bluer or younger stars, the bar-induced\nvertex deviation increases in amplitude, very similar to\nthe observed values.\nThis gives strong support for the hypothesis that the\nvertex deviation observed in the Solar neighbourhood is\n\n\f10\n\nG.

Bar-induced deviations of the mean velocity from the unperturbed state up to m = 2 for \u03c30 = 0.2v0 . The bar is aligned\nwith the horizontal axis and is supposed to rotate clockwise. The solar circle is dashed, dotted circles are CR and OLR.\n\npredominantly caused by deviations from axisymmetry\nrather than from equilibrium. This explanation also naturally accounts for the fact that lv for young stars has the\nsame direction as for old ones, which with the traditional\nexplanation would be a chance coincidence.\nThe axis ratio of the (principal components of the)\nvelocity dispersion tensor, \u03c322 /\u03c312 , is clearly affected by the\ncentral bar. In particular, values less than 0.5, Oort's value\nfor a flat rotation curve, are possible (Oort's value is a\nlower limit for an axisymmetric galaxy, see Sect. 3.3 and\nEvans & Collett, 1993; Dehnen, 1999). This nicely fits to\nthe values inferred from HIPPARCOS data (Dehnen &\nBinney, 1998), which give \u03c322 /\u03c312 \u223c 0.42 for the old stellar\ndisk.\nIn the Milky Way, as well as in many barred galaxies,\nthe bar is not the only deviation from a smooth axisymmetric background. Most prominently, spiral arm structure and an elliptic (or oval) disk and/or halo add further\nnon-axisymmetric perturbations. However, we will defer\nthe discussion of the influence of spiral arms on the outer\ndisk kinematics to a future paper.\nAcknowledgements.
