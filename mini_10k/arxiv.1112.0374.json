In particular, invariance under spacetime\nrefoliations is traded for invariance of the theory under local spatial conformal transformations that preserve\nthe total spatial volume. The equivalence is obtained by manipulating the constraint structure of General\nrelativity, but can only be achieved if one first uses the Stuckelberg mechanism to extend the original phase\nspace. Much like other known uses of extended phase space1 the use of extended phase space for obtaining\nSD seems unavoidable. The basic conditions required for the symmetry trading is the existence of two (the\noriginal and the \"new\") symmetries which are maximally symplectic (i.e. gauge fix one another). Motivations for SD are many, and discussed in [1, 2], but a \"uniqueness\" type argument comes about only when\nconsidering field quantization. In fact, even before field quantization, in the absence of a true Hamiltonian\n(as in generally covariant systems), the fact that we have two symmetries gauge-fixing one another automatically implies that both symmetries are kept in the BRST formalism. Work on the construction of SD\nthrough \"symmetry doubling\" will be reported on shortly.\nOne of the upsides of the symmetry trading is that the constraint structure of SD becomes much simpler\nthan that of GR, and in fact qualifies as a (infinite-dimensional) Lie algebra, as opposed to the Lie algebroid\nstructure of GR. Shape dynamics is furthermore left with a unique (and single) Hamiltonian constraint\nto generate global time translation, yielding a tool to attack those problems of time related to refoliation\ninvariance. However the trade-off implies that this global Hamiltonian is non-local. This holistic aspect of\nthe theory makes it more difficult to incorporate matter as an \"add on\" to the theory. Instead, one must\ninput the matter Hamiltonian already at the base level of the construction of SD, in the linking theory.\nThe problem of incorporating different interactions to the theory are of utmost importance, as it is\nthrough matter that one may obtain most phenomenological predictions from the theory, particularly those\nthat might differ from its general relativistic counterparts. It turns out that the construction of a SD\nextension with standard matter content can be obtained from the appropriate GR theory by straightforward\napplication of the construction principle given in [1]. This paper is based on [4].\n\u2217 gomes.ha@gmail.com\n1 We just mention two examples: the original Stueckelberg trick [3], which introduces a scalar field into an Abelian gauge\ntheory making it massive but preserving gauge invariance, and the BRST construction, which adds ghosts and ghost momenta\nto the original phase space in order to apply cohomology tools to understand the space of gauge invariant functionals.\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nPreliminaries\n\nTo make this paper sufficiently self-contained, we briefly review the construction principle for equivalent gauge\ntheories, in particular the construction of Shape Dynamics in vacuum. The following procedure is a summary\nof that contained in [1]. Basically, the procedure in the concrete case of General Relativity consists in first\nextending phase space to accommodate extra redundant symmetries obtained through \"conformalization\".\nThis does not mean that the extended theory is in any way conformally invariant. Then we apply two\ndifferent particular gauge fixings and follow the Dirac analysis to obtain two dual theories with distinct\nsymmetry properties: GR and Shape Dynamics.\n\n2.1\n\nPure Shape Dynamics\n\nLet us now briefly review the construction of Shape Dynamics as a theory equivalent to ADM gravity on\na compact Cauchy surface \u03a3 without boundary. For a more thorough review see [1] or [?]. We start with\nthe standard ADM phase space \u0393ADM = {(g, \u03c0) : g \u2208 Riem, \u03c0 \u2208 Tg\u2217 (Riem)}, where Riem denotes the\nset of Riemannian metrics on the above defined 3-manifold \u03a3, and the usual first class ADM constraints,\n\u221a\n\u03c0 ab \u03c0ab \u2212 21 \u03c0 2\n\u221a\ni.e. the scalar constraints S(x) =\n\u2212 gR and momentum constraints H a (x) = \u03c0 ab;b (x) thereon.\ng\nWe extend the ADM phase space with the phase space of a scalar field \u03c6(x) and its canonically conjugate\nmomentum density \u03c0\u03c6 (x), which we introduce as additional first class constraints Q(x) = \u03c0\u03c6 (x) \u2248 0. The\nsystem is thus merely a trivial embedding of the original ADM onto the extended\u0010 phase space. Now\u0011 use the\nR\ncanonical transformation T\u03c6 generated by the generating functional F = d3 x gab e4\u03c6\u0302 \u03a0ab + \u03c6\u03a0\u03c6 , where\np\np\nR\nR\n\u03c6\u0302(x) := \u03c6(x) \u2212 61 lnhe6\u03c6 ig using the mean hf ig := V1 d3 x |g|f (x) and 3-volume Vg := d3 x |g|. These\n\"means\" and volumes technically appear as a manner to yield dynamically equivalent theories. They force\nthe appearance of a global Hamiltonian in SD.\nAt this point we have the first class set of constraints T\u03c6 S(x), T\u03c6 H(x) and T\u03c6 Q(x) = \u03c0\u03c6 (x) \u2212 4(\u03c0 \u2212\n\u221a\nh\u03c0i g)(x). We then perform the phase space reduction for the gauge fixing condition \u03c0\u03c6 (x) = 0. The\ncrucial technical steps come once one has imposed such a gauge-fixing, also sometimes called \"best-matching\nconstraint\". For it is necessary for the symmetry trading to work that this gauge-fixing be completely second\nclass wrt the set of original constraints one wants to trade for, and first class wrt all the other constraints.\nFurthermore one must show that the variable conjugate to \u03c0\u03c6 , i.e. \u03c6 can be set such that that same original\nset of constraints can be strongly solved for (solved for in the entire phase space).\nAfter some algebra, we find that all but one of the T\u03c6 S(x) constraints can be solved for \u03c6 = \u03c6o , and this\none leftover constraint yields the global Hamiltonian of SD. The end result is the following set of first class\nconstraints, which define Shape Dynamics\n= T\nR \u03c6o3S(Nabo )\n=\nd x\u03c0 L\u03be gab\np \u0011\nR 3 \u0010\nQ(\u03c1) =\nd x\u03c1 \u03c0 \u2212 h\u03c0i |g| ,\n\nHSD\nH(\u03be)\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03c6o (g, \u03c0) is such that HSD = 0 combined with \u03c6 = \u03c6o (g, \u03c0) is equivalent to T\u03c6RS(x) = 0 (at the surface\n\u03c0\u03c6 = 0). Moreover, No denotes the CMC lapse function, \u03c0 = \u03c0 ab gab and h\u03c0i = V1 d3 x\u03c0. The constraints\nH(\u03be) generate spatial diffeomorphisms and the constraints Q(\u03c1) generate conformal transformations that\nleave the total spatial volume invariant.\nThe main issue that forbids or allows the trading is that the gauge-fixed constraints arising from the\nStueckelberg mechanism (best-matching constraints) are first-class amongst themselves (and possibly also\nwith respect to other constraints that one does not want to disturb, e.g. 3-diffeomorphisms) and second class\nsolely with respect to the constraint that one wants to trade for. Thus the construction of a linking theory is\nnon-generic. The condition that (a subset of) the best matched original constraints can be uniquely solved\nfor the auxiliary variables \u03c6 is indispensable for the existence of a linking theory.\n\n2\n\n\f3\n3.1\n\nGeneral Procedure\nWhat constrains the coupling to the conformal factor?\n\nWhen we try to couple different fields to gravity, we will have to face basically one question: how does one\nscale fields? What exponent is viable in the conformal coupling of a scalar field, \u03c8 \u2192 e\u03b1\u03c6\u0302 \u03c8? This is an\nimportant issue because if the scaling is not correct we could encounter two difficult obstructions.\nThe first obstruction is that if we are dealing with a field that possesses some kind of gauge symmetry\nit might not be possible to find a constraint Q that is first class with respect to the gauge constraint. The\nsecond is that the conserved charge (which we call D) implicit inside Q that defines the foliation might\ndepend on the field. As a subset case, there might be an even worse consequence if the field in question\npossesses some gauge symmetry (like electromagnetism). For then the charge could turn out to depend on\nthe gauge potential. This is possible in spite of the existence of a field-dependent D that is first class with\nrespect to the gauge generator of the field. Indeed with any other choice of scaling than the one chosen in\nthe text, this possibility is realized with any Yang-Mills type interaction for non \"neutral coupling\". Neutral\ncoupling is the particular choice of empty scaling \u03b1 = 0, i.e. non-gravitational fields have conformal weight\nzero. This means that fields are only scaled in the sense that they are \"carried along\" by the scaling of the\nspatial metric.\n\n3.2\n\nExplicit coupling\n\nWe follow the construction principle for pure Shape Dynamics and suppose we have a gravity-matter system\non a compact manifold without boundary, with constraints\n\u0001\nR 3\nH(\u03be) =\nd x \u0012\u03c0 ab (L\u03be g)ab + \u03c0 A (L\u03be \u03c6)A\n\u0013\np\nR 3\n1\nA\nab\ncd\n\u221a\n(2)\nS(N ) =\nd x\n\u03c0 Gabcd \u03c0 \u2212 (R \u2212 2\u039b) |g| + Hmatter (gab , \u03c6A , \u03c0 ) N (x)\nR 3 \u03b1 |g|\n\u221a\n\u03b1\nG (\u03bb\u03b1 ) =\nd xG (gab , \u03c6A )\u03bb\u03b1 g\n\nwhere we denote the non-gravitational configuration degrees of freedom collectively by \u03c6A and their canonically conjugate momenta \u03c0 A . We assume that the matter Hamiltonian Hmatter does neither contain \u03c0 ab nor\nany spatial derivatives of gab , which seems to be an assumption that is realized in nature. We furthermore\nassume the constraint associated to internal gauge symmetries to be a functional of only the \"position\" variables \u03c6A , gab . This is a condition realized in all matter fields studied, and which greatly simplifies treatment.\nTo construct a linking theory we extend phase space by a scalar \u03c6(x) with canonically conjugate momentum density \u03c0\u03c6 (x) and impose the additional first class constraint Q(x) = \u03c0\u03c6 (x), which eliminates\nthe phase space extension on shell. To perform canonical best matching for volume preserving conformal\ntransformations, we specify the conformal weight of matter fields by neutral coupling. We thus use the\ngenerator\nZ\n\u0011\n\u0010\n(3)\nF = d3 x e4\u03c6\u0302 gab \u03a0ab + \u03c6\u03a0\u03c6 + \u03c6A \u03a0A\nto implement the conformal Kretschmannization. This acts non-trivially only on the gravitational variables.\nThe resulting canonical transformations have Q(\u03c1) and (respectively) H(\u03be) transform weakly into\n\u0010\np \u0011\u0011\nR 3 \u0010\nQ(\u03c1) =\nd x\u03c1 \u03c0\u03c6 \u2212 4 \u03c0 \u2212 h\u03c0i |g|\n(4)\n\u0001\nR 3\nH(\u03be) =\nd x \u03c0 ab (L\u03be g)ab + \u03c0\u03c6 L\u03be \u03c6 + \u03c0 A (L\u03be \u03c6)A .\n\nIn the cases of interest that we have studied, the gauge constraint decouples from the conformal transformation, so that T\u03c6 G\u03b1 \u221d G\u03b1 \u2248 0.\nAfter imposing the best-matching condition \u03c0\u03c6 (x) = 0 we always get an equation of the form:\n\u0014\n\u0015\n3\n{T\u03c6 S(N ), \u03c0\u03c6 (x)} = T\u03c6 \u2212 S(x) + 2(\u2206matter N (x) \u2212 h\u2206matter N i)\n(5)\n2\nIn the general case one has to compute explicitly the entire bracket {T\u03c6 Hmatter , \u03c0\u03c6 } and work out the appropriate form of the \u2206matter to check its invertibility. Let us here restrict to the simpler case occurring when\n3\n\n\fthe matter Hamiltonian does not contain spatial derivatives of the metric tensor nor metric momenta.

A useful form of\n(9) for the specific case of homogeneous scaling is given by the following: if Hmatter \u2192 en\u03c6 Hmatter scales with\npower n, we have the equivalent condition (assuming Hmatter is positive):\nn\u22122\u22640\n\n(10)\n\nIn some cases the inequality (8) cannot be attained, in others it implies a bound on the density of the\nfields, and yet in others it is always obeyed, since (9) is valid. Examples of the first kind are obtained from\nfields with four-dimensional conformal coupling, examples of the second kind are obtained by adding a mass\n\u221a\npotential term to the Hamiltonian, of the form \u03c8 2 g, and of the third are Yang-Mills and the massless scalar.\nHowever, as soon as this restriction is imposed, one can use the implicit function theorem to complete the\nconstruction of SD for these matter models.\n\n4\n\nConclusions\n\nAs a theory possessing 3-dimensional conformal invariance and unique surfaces of simultaneity, Shape Dynamics seems very counter-intuitive in the light of the teachings of Relativity. Furthermore, the existence\nof fields with mass would seem to undermine conformal invariance. In this paper we have shown that these\nprejudices are not justified. Applying \"neutral conformal coupling\" to the fields - so that they only feel space\nstretching but have otherwise no independent scaling - our method preserves the fields' canonical constraints\nfor all cases of interest. Furthermore, for all such cases the matter Hamiltonian contains neither metric\nmomenta nor metric spatial derivatives, enabling us to apply our bound (8). In such cases, the bound gives a\nstraightforward criterium telling us whether a given field can or cannot be encompassed by Shape Dynamics.\nAll the constituent fields automatically obey the bound except for the Higgs potential and the cosmological\nconstant, whose value must be bounded. We point out the important fact that the deSitter solution does\nnot obey the bound (8), hence it is not a solution for SD 2 , and we thus have a first phenomenologically\nverifiable deviation from standard GR. This work makes the construction of a phenomenologically viable\ncosmological model imperative for the development of Shape Dynamics.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported in part by the U.S. Department of Energy under grant DE-FG02-91ER40674.\n2 We thank Sean Gryb for pointing this out to us. The statement that the model does not obey the bound implies that the\ndual theory does not gauge fix the refoliations, and we are left with more than one \"global Hamiltonians\" in the dual theory. So\none could wonder if this ambiguity is in fact not due to the high symmetry content of deSitter space. To this effect we note that\nwe could always make the \u03c3ab \u03c3ab term in (8) small enough so that no symmetry is present and yet it still breaks the bound.\n\n4\n\n\fReferences\n[1] H.
