Another possibility has\nbeen evoked from band structure calculations: the filling of the pxy bands through electron transfer from the\nAl atoms going against superconductivity5 . As stated\nin Ref.8 one of the key parameters to test this hypothesis is obviously pressure. A monotonic dependence of\nthe structure with pressure has been previously reported,\nmeasurements going only up to 8GPa9,10 . On the other\nhand, the pressure results concerning the superconducting transition reported up to date on MgB2 clearly disagree. High pressure quasi-hydrostatic resistivity measurements (\u226425GPa)11 reported a parabolic or linear decrease of TC with pressure. While hydrostatic low pressure measurements (\u22642GPa) showed a linear dependence\nof TC at rates of -1.6K/GPa12 or -2K/GPa13, considerably steeper than that of the linear dependent samples\nof the high pressure measurements, \u223c-0.8K/GPa11.\nHere we perform measurements of TC and of structure\nparameters for MgB2 for pressures up to near 40GP. We\ncorrelate our results to the evolution of the electronic\nstructure. We illustrate this point by a tight-binding calculation of the pressure dependence of the relevant bands.\nWe can conclude that there is no structural transition,\nthe decrease of TC with increasing pressure being due to\nthe transfer of electrons from the 3D \u03c0 bands to the 2D\n\u03c3 bands. Within this picture, the discrepancies in the TC\ndependence between different samples can be attributed\nto Mg non-stoichiometry.\nMagnesium diboride has the AlB2 -type hexagonal structure, with a=3.08, c=3.51, space group P6/mmm, Z=114 .\nThe atomic positions are Mg at 1a (0 0 0), B at 2d (1/3\n2/3 1/2) (inset of Fig. 1). The structural arrangement\ncan be described as the alternate stacking of planes of\nboron atoms forming a honeycomb lattice, and planes of\nmagnesium atoms forming a triangular one. Each Mg\natom is at the center of an hexagonal prism made of\nboron atoms at a distance of \u22482.5. Each boron atom is\n\nWe report measurements on MgB2 up to \u223c40GPa. Increasing pressure yields a monotonous decrease of the lattice\nparameters and of the c/a ratio, but no structural transition down to parameters smaller than those of AlB2 . The\ntransition superconducting temperature also decreases with\ntemperature in a sample dependent way. The results are explained by an increase of the filling of the 2D pxy bands with\npressure, the Mg stoichiometry determining the starting position of the Fermi level. Our measurements indicate that these\nhole bands are the relevant ones for superconductivity.\n74.62.Fj, 61.10.Nz, 74.70.-b\n\nThe recent discovery1 of superconductivity in MgB2\nat \u223c40K gives an unprecedented opportunity to study\na high temperature superconductor different from the\ncuprates. Although up to now, most of the results point\ntowards a conventional microscopic origin, certain characteristics of the band structure2\u20135 suggest similarities\nwith the cuprates. Magnesium atoms yield both electrons to the boron atoms, so we are in a situation similar to that of graphite, where the pz orbitals give rise\nto the \u03c0 bands responsible for its transport properties.\nHowever, in MgB2 the magnesium ions also lower the\nenergy of these \u03c0 bands, allowing the \u03c3 bands formed\nby the pxy orbitals to cross the Fermi surface, furnishing\nholes that have a strong two-dimensional (2D) character. These holes have an unusually strong coupling to\nthe boron stretching bonds yielding an intermediate superconducting coupling strength6 . Besides, it has been\nshown that Al doping has drastic consequences on the\nstructure and behaviour of this material7 : the reduction\nof the c lattice parameter from 3.5 down to 3.4 causes\nthe disappearance of superconductivity. This suggests\nthat the proximity of MgB2 to a structural instability\ncould be one of the factors enhancing the superconduct-\n\n1\n\n\fat the sample position. After removal of spurious peaks,\nthe corrected images were averaged over 360\u25e6 about the\ndirect beam position, yielding Intensity vs. 2\u03b8 diffractograms. These data were analyzed by the Rietveld technique using the Fullprof18 software. The peak shape was\nmodeled with a pseudo-Voigt function. Cell and profile\nparameters and an overall thermal parameter were refined at each pressure. On increasing pressure, phases of\nsolid molecular nitrogen also appeared19 . These phases\nwere taken into account by the cell constraint refinement\ntechnique. The data could be successfully fitted with the\nAlB2 -type structure up to the highest pressure investigated \u224839GPa. The variable overlap of the MgB2 Bragg\npeaks with those from the different phases of molecular\nN could lead to some inaccuracy in the determination\nof the MgB2 cell parameters under pressure. Therefore,\nthe MgB2 cell parameters were also directly determined\nfrom the angular positions of the strong and well defined\nreflections (110) and (101). The results found by both\nmethods were in excellent agreement.\nFig. 1 shows the observed p(V) dependence; the line is\nthe fit using Vinet's equation of state20 :\n\nsurrounded by three other boron atoms\n\u221a forming an equilateral triangle at a distance of a/ 3 \u22481.78, while the\nin-plane Mg-Mg distances are equal to the a parameter.\nThe sample employed were synthesized by direct reaction\nof the elements. Starting materials were bright magnesium flakes (Aldrich Chemical, Milwaukee, Wisconsin)\nand sub-micrometer amorphous boron powder (Callery\nChemical, Evans City, Pennsylvania), lightly mixed in a\nhalf-gram batch, and sealed in a molybdenum tube under argon. This tube was in turn sealed in an evacuated quartz ampoule. The material was heated 1 hour at\n600\u25e6 C, 1 hour at 800\u25e6 C, and 2 hours at 950\u25e6 C, and then\nlightly ground, to provide sample A. The same powder\nwas then hot-pressed at 10Kbar 1 hour at 700\u25e6 C to supply the ceramic sample B. The preparation of sample C\nwas identical but kept only 1 hour at 950\u25e6C; while sample\nD was prepared using a tantalum tube heated 3 hoursat\n900\u25e6 C. Sample E was heated 1 hour in an Ar/H2 flow.\nThe electrical resistivity measurements were performed\nin a sintered diamond Bridgman reinforced anvil apparatus using a pyrophillite gasket and two steatite disks as\nthe pressure medium15 . The Cu-Be device that locked\nthe anvils can be cycled between 1.2K and 300K in a\nsealed dewar. Pressure was calibrated against the various\nphase transitions of Bi under pressure at room temperature, and by superconducting Pb and Bi manometers at\nlow temperature. The overall uncertainty in the quasihydrostatic pressure is estimated to be \u00b115%. The pressure spread across the sintered diamond anvils was previously determined on Pb-manometers to be of about 1.52GPa depending on the applied pressure. The temperature was determined using a calibrated cernox thermometer with a maximum uncertainty (due mainly to temperature gradients across the Cu-Be clamp) of 0.5K. Four\nprobe electrical resistivity d.c. measurements were made\nusing a Keithley 2182 nanovoltmeter combined with a\nKeithley 220 current source and by using platinum wires\nto make contact to the sample.\nThe equation of state of MgB2 was determined up to\n\u224839GPa by angle-resolved X-ray diffraction at the high\npressure beamline ID30 of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility. The MgB2 powder from sample A was\nloaded into a membrane- driven diamond anvil cell with\ndiamond tips of diameter 300\u03bcm and stainless-steel gasket with hole of 120\u03bcm. Nitrogen was used as pressure transmitting medium in order to keep good hydrostatic conditions. The pressure was determined by\nthe ruby fluorescence method16 with a precision of 0.1\nGPa. X-ray powder diffraction patterns were recorded\nevery \u22483GPa by angle-resolved X-ray diffraction using\nfocused monochromatic beam at wavelength \u03bb=0.3738.\nThe X-ray signal was averaged over the whole sample\narea with a 30mm diameter pinhole. The diffraction patterns were recorded on Mar345 image plate detector located at 360mm from the sample. They were analyzed\nusing the software package Fit2D17 . The sample to detector distance and the image plate inclination angles\nwere precisely calibrated using a silicon standard located\n\np = 3B0\n\n(1 \u2212 f\u03bd )\n3\nexp[ (B0\u2032 \u2212 1)(1 \u2212 f\u03bd )]\n2\nf\u03bd\n2\n\nwhere f\u03bd = (V /V0 )1/3 . The variable of the least squares\nfit were B0 , B0\u2032 and V0 , representing the bulk modulus, its derivative and the cell volume at room pressure,\nrespectively. The obtained values were B0 =150(5)GPa,\nB0\u2032 =4.0(3) and V0 =29.00(4)3 (V0 is in agreement with the\n28.99(1)3 value reported in Ref.14 ). The pressure variation of the lattice parameters and and c/a are shown\nin Fig.2. Both cell parameters decrease monotonically\nwith increasing pressure. No sign of structural transition is seen. It is worth noting that the Rietveld refinements did not indicate the presence of a structural change\nfor MgB2 in the whole pressure range investigated. The\nc/a ratio decreases linearly up to 38.9GPa, with a slope\nof -1.3 10\u22123 GPa\u22121 . As predicted theoretically by Loa\nand Syassen21 , the compression is more isotropic than\nexpected for a layered system.\nFig. 3 shows the evolution of TC with pressure for five\nsamples of MgB2 . We add for comparison, the rates reported by Lorenz et al.12 and Saito et al.13 , -1.6K/GPa\nand -2K/GPa, respectively. Clearly they give different\nbehaviours: samples A, B and E follow a quadratic dependence starting with a small slope of -0.35K/GPa,\nwhile samples C and D have a linear decreasing rate but\nwith a weaker slope than those obtained in the quoted\nreferences. It is true that those measurements have been\ndone in hydrostatic apparata (\u00a12GPa) while ours are performed in a quasihydrostatic anvil system. However, the\nspread even among our samples shows that there is an\nintrinsic reason for those differences.\nThe differences in the behavior of the resistance of our\nsamples correlates with the TC pressure dependencies.\nThe samples that are metallic at all temperatures and\n2\n\n\fpressures have a steeper TC pressure dependence than\nthose that display upturns in the resistivity at high pressures. It can be argued that the temperature dependence\nof the resistivity may be affected by the powder nature of\nthe sample. However, four of our five samples are powder\nsamples and only half of them are totally metallic.\nThe important point is that the TC pressure dependence\nnormally constitutes an intrinsic parameter, not affected\nby the powder, ceramic or monocrystalline nature of\nthe sample. An example is the case of high temperature superconducting cuprates22 , where the differences in\nTC pressure dependencies among different groups, have\nbeen tracked down to intrinsic effects, such as oxygen\nordering23,24 , or doping25,26 . The observed differences\nfor MgB2 should then not be neglected as spurious results, but a search for the hidden parameter explaining\nthem in a coherent manner, is necessary.\nWe would like to point out that the issue of nonstoichiometry, that has been neglected up to now, should\nbe crucial in this material. The control of the Mg concentration is difficult at the temperatures at which the\nsamples are synthesized. The band structure is complex,\nwith different bands crossing the Fermi level. Mg defects\nwill alter the occupancy of these bands, besides being\nscattering centers for off plane carriers.\nIn Fig.4 we simulate the pressure dependence of these\nbands by adapting the tight-binding model used for\ngraphite27 , and fitting it to the MgB2 electronic structure obtained from first principles2 . Details will be given\nelsewhere. As in Ref.3 the hopping parameters are scaled\nwith the inverse of the square of the lattice parameter\nvariation. If we consider that the compression of c is\nstronger than the one of a (experimentally the c/a ratio has decreased 4% at 35Gpa), and thus we take the\nlast one as constant, only the 3D pz bands will change\nwith pressure. Therefore the most important variation\nwill be their shift to higher energies. The consequence of\nthis will be the electron transfer of electrons from these\n\u03c0 bands to the pxy (\u03c3) bands. The decrease of TC with\npressure can then be attributed to this filling, these 2D\nbands resulting the relevant ones for superconductivity.\nAccording to Fig. 2 of Ref.5 , for the stoichiometric material the Fermi level falls just on the verge of a steep\ndecrease of the density of states of these hole bands. A\nshift of the Fermi level to higher energies will cause a decrease of the density of states of these carriers, and the\nobserved decrease of TC . Though here exact Mg concentration could not be determined due to very small sample\nsize (quantitative work on this matter is in progress), we\ncan expect that with Mg deficiency the Fermi level will\nbe in the flatter region of the 2D band. In this case pressure will not produce a strong effect (samples A, B and\nD). Instead for more stoichiometric samples (samples C,\nD and the data from Refs.12 and13 ), the compression induced shift will cause a more dramatic decrease of TC .\nIn conclusion we have shown that the lattice parameters of MgB2 monotonously decrease with pressure up\nto 40GPa. Although we have attained smaller lattice\n\nparameters than for AlB2 , we do not observe a crystallographic transition. The pressure dependence of TC\ncan be naturally explained by considering that the 2D\npxy holes are the driving carriers for superconductivity. Furthermore, the structural instability that has been\nfound on Al substitution is also probably the result of the\ncomplete filling of the pxy bands, that can be expected\nin MgB2 at even higher pressures. Finally, the system\nshould be extremely sensitive to Mg non-stoichiometry;\nfinding a way to control this non-stoichiometry may be\nthe simplest way to higher TC .\n\nCorresponding author, e-mail nunez@polycnrs-gre.fr\nConsejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas y T\u00e9cnicas\n(Argentina) Doctoral fellow.\n1\nJ.
