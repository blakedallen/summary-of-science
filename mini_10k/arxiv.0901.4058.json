Using our new 3-D relativistic electromagnetic particle (REMP) code parallelized with MPI, we have investigated\nlong-term particle acceleration associated with an relativistic electron-positron jet propagating in an unmagnetized ambient\nelectron-positron plasma. The simulations have been performed using a much longer simulation system than our previous\nsimulations in order to investigate the full nonlinear stage of the Weibel instability and its particle acceleration mechanism.\nCold jet electrons are thermalized and ambient electrons are accelerated in the resulting shocks. The acceleration of ambient\nelectrons leads to a maximum ambient electron density three times larger than the original value. Behind the bow shock in the\njet shock strong electromagnetic fields are generated. These fields may lead to the afterglow emission. We have calculated the\ntime evolution of the spectrum from two electrons propagating in a uniform parallel magnetic field to verify the technique.\nKeywords: Weibel instability, magnetic field generation, synchrotron radiation\nPACS: 98.70.Rz gamma-ray sources; gamma-ray bursts\n\nRPIC SIMULATIONS\nParticle-in-cell (PIC) simulations can shed light on the physical mechanism of particle acceleration that occurs in\nthe complicated dynamics within relativistic shocks. Recent PIC simulations of relativistic electron-ion and electronpositron jets injected into an ambient plasma show that acceleration occurs within the downstream jet [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].\nIn general, these simulations have confirmed that relativistic jets excite the Weibel instability. The Weibel instability\ngenerates current filaments and associated magnetic fields [7], and accelerates electrons [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].\nPair Jets Injected into Unmagnetized Pair Plasmas using a Large System\nWe have performed simulations using a system with (Lx , Ly , Lz ) = (4005\u2206, 105\u2206, 105\u2206) and a total of \u223c 1 billion\nparticles (12 particles/cell/species for the ambient plasma) in the active grid zones [8]. In the simulations the electron\nskin depth, \u03bbce = c/\u03c9pe = 10.0\u2206, where \u03c9pe = (4\u03c0 e2 ne /me )1/2 is the electron plasma frequency and the electron Debye\nlength \u03bbe is half of the grid size. Here the computational domain is six times longer than in our previous simulations\n[4, 5]. The electron number density of the jet is 0.676ne, where ne is the ambient electron density and \u03b3 = 15. The\nelectron/positron thermal velocity of the jet is vej,th = 0.014c, where c = 1 is the speed of light. Jets are injected in\na plane across the computational grid at x = 25\u2206 in the positive x direction in order to eliminate effects associated\nwith the boundary conditions at x = xmin . Radiating boundary conditions were used on the planes at x = xmin & xmax .\nPeriodic boundary conditions were used on all transverse boundaries. The ambient and jet electron-positron plasma\nhas mass ratio me\u2212 /me+ = 1. The electron/positron thermal velocity in the ambient plasma is vea,th = 0.05c.\nFigure 1 shows the averaged (in the y \u2212 z plane) electron density and electromagnetic field energy along the jet at\n\u22121 and 3750\u03c9 \u22121 . The resulting profiles of jet (red), ambient (blue), and total (black) electron density are\nt = 2000\u03c9pe\npe\nshown in Fig. 1a. The ambient electrons are accelerated by the jet electrons and pile up towards the front part of jet.\nAt the earlier time the ambient plasma density increases linearly behind the jet front as shown by the dashed blue line\nin Fig. 1a. At the later time the ambient plasma shows a rapid increase to a plateau behind the jet front, with additional\nincrease to a higher plateau farther behind the jet front. The jet density remains approximately constant except near\nthe jet front.\n\n\f60\n\n(a)\n40\nn\n20\n\n0\n0.3\n\n(b)\n\n0.1\n0.03\n\u03b5\n0.01\n0.003\n0.001\n500\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n2000\nX/\u2206\n\n2500\n\n3000\n\n3500\n\n\u22121 (solid lines) and 2000\u03c9 \u22121\nFIGURE 1.

Fig. 1a shows jet electrons (red), ambient electrons (blue), and the total electron density (black). Fig. 1b shows\nelectric field energy (blue), magnetic field energy (red), and the total field energy (black) divided by the total kinetic energy.\n\nThe Weibel instability remains excited by continuously injected jet particles and the electromagnetic fields are kept\nat a high level, about four times that seen in a previous much shorter grid simulation system (Lx = 640\u2206). At the\n\u22121 ) a large electromagnetic oscillating structure is generated and accelerates the\nearlier simulation time (t = 2000\u03c9pe\nambient plasma. As shown in Fig. 1b, at the later simulation time the oscillating structure extends up to x/\u2206 = 1100,\nthen becomes more uniform and the magnetic field energy becomes larger than the electric field energy. These strong\nelectromagnetic fields become very small beyond x/\u2206 = 2000 in the shocked ambient region [4, 5].\nThe acceleration of ambient electrons becomes visible when jet electrons pass about x/\u2206 = 500. The maximum\n\u22121 . The maximum density gradually reaches a plateau\ndensity of accelerated ambient electrons is attained at t = 1750\u03c9pe\nas seen in Fig. 1a. The maximum electromagnetic field energy is located at x/\u2206 = 700 as shown in Fig. 1b. The location\nof this maximum remains in this region at large simulation times.\n\nNew Numerical Method of Calculating Synchrotron and Jitter Emission from Electron\nTrajectories in Self-consistently Generated Magnetic Fields\nLet a particle be at position r0 (t) at time t [6, 9]. At the same time, we observe the electric field from the particle\nfrom position r. However, because of the finite propagation velocity of light, we observe the particle at an earlier\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nposition r0 (t ) where it was at the retarded time t = t \u2212 \u03b4 t = t \u2212 R(t )/c. Here R(t ) = |r \u2212 r0 (t )| is the distance from\n\u2032\nthe charge (at the retarded time t ) to the observer.\nAfter some calculation and simplifying assumptions the total energy W radiated per unit solid angle per unit\n\u03b2 can be expressed as\nfrequency from a charged particle moving with instantaneous velocity \u03b2 under acceleration \u03b2\u0307\nd 2W\nd\u03a9d \u03c9\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n=\n\n\u03bc0 cq2\n16\u03c0 3\n\n2\nZ \u221e\n\u03b2 ] i\u03c9 (t \u2032 \u2212n*r0 (t\u2032 )/c) \u2032\nn \u00d7 [(n \u2212 \u03b2 ) \u00d7 \u03b2\u0307\ndt\ne\n\u221e\n\n(1 \u2212 \u03b2 * n)2\n\n(1)\n\nHere, n \u2261 R(t )/|R(t )| is a unit vector that points from the particle's retarded position towards the observer. The\nchoice of unit vector n along the direction of propagation of the jet (hereafter taken to be the x-axis) corresponds to\nhead-on emission. For any other choice of n (e.g., \u03b8 = 1/\u03b3 ), off-axis emission is seen by the observer. The observer's\nviewing angle is set by the choice of n (n2x + n2y + n2z = 1).\nIn order to calculate radiation from relativistic jets propagating along the x direction [6] we consider a test case\nwhich includes a parallel magnetic field (Bx ), and jet velocity of vj1,2 = 0.99c. Two electrons are injected with different\nperpendicular velocities (v\u22a51 = 0.1c, v\u22a52 = 0.12c). A maximum Lorenz factor of \u03b3max = {(1 \u2212 (v2j2 + v2\u22a52 )/c2 }\u22121/2 =\n13.48 accompanies the larger perpendicular velocity.\nFigure 2 shows electron trajectories in the x \u2212 y plane (a: left panel), the radiation (retarded) electric field (red: v\u22a51 =\n0.12c, blue: v\u22a51 = 0.1c) (b: middle panel), and spectra (right panel) for the case Bx = 3.70. The two electrons are propagating left to right with gyration in the y \u2212 z plane (not shown). The gyroradius is about 0.44\u2206 for the electron with the\nlarger perpendicular velocity. The power spectra were calculated at the point (x, y, z) = (64, 000, 000\u2206, 43.0\u2206, 43.0\u2206).\nThe seven curves show the power spectrum at viewing angles of 0\u25e6 (red), 10\u25e6 (orange), 20\u25e6 (yellow), 30\u25e6 (moss green),\n45\u25e6 (green), 70\u25e6 (light blue), and 90\u25e6 (blue). The higher frequencies become stronger at the 10\u25e6 viewing angle . The\n\u22121 for this case is 13.48\u25e6 . As shown in this panel, the spectrum at a larger\ncritical angle for off-axis radiation \u03b8\u03b3 = \u03b3max\n\u25e6\nviewing angle (> 20 ) has smaller amplitude.\n\n\flog10P\n\n(a)\n\n4\n\n6.4\n\n42\n\n(b)\n\nY/\u2206\n\n1\n\n\u20131\n\n\u20136.4\n0\n120\n\n140\nX/\u2206\n\n160\n\n70 \u030a\n90 \u030a\n\n0\n\n\u20133.2\n\n100\n\nP ~ \u03c91\n\n45 \u030a\n2\n\nE 0\n\n34\n\n10 \u030a\n20 \u030a\n30 \u030a\n\n3\n\n3.2\n38\n\n(c) \u03b8 = 0 \u030a\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\nT/\u03c9pe\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n\u20132\n10\u20131\n\n10 0\n\n101\n10 2\n\u03c9/\u03c9 pe\n\n10 3\n\nFIGURE 2.

The observed power spectrum at different viewing angles from the\n\u22121 .\ntwo electrons (c). Frequency is in units of \u03c9pe\n\nSince the jet plasma has a large velocity x-component in the simulation frame, the radiation from the particles\n(electrons and positrons) is heavily beamed along the x-axis (jitter radiation) [11].\nIn order to obtain the spectrum of synchrotron (jitter) emission, we consider an ensemble of electrons selected in\nthe region where the Weibel instability has grown fully and electrons are accelerated in the generated magnetic fields.\nWe will calculate emission from about 20,000 electrons during the sampling time ts = t2 \u2212 t1 with Nyquist frequency\n\u03c9N = 1/2\u2206t where \u2206t is the simulation time step and the frequency resolution \u2206\u03c9 = 1/ts .\nEmission obtained with the method described above is self-consistent, and automatically accounts for magnetic\nfield structures on the small scales responsible for jitter emission. By performing such calculations for simulations\nwith different parameters, we can investigate and compare the quite different regimes of jitter- and synchrotrontype emission [11]. The feasibility of this approach has already been demonstrated [9, 10], and its implementation is\nstraightforward. Thus, we should be able to address the low frequency GRB spectral index violation of the synchrotron\nspectrum line of death [11].\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work is supported by AST-0506719, AST-0506666, NASA-NNG05GK73G, NNX07AJ88G, NNX08AG83G,\nNNX08AL39G, and NNX09AD16G.
