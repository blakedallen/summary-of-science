This relies on general considerations about equivariant objects in\nmodule categories (which may be applicable in other situations as well), as well as results of\nIshii-Ueda-Uehara concerning the derived categories of coherent sheaves on the resolutions\nof (Am ) surface singularities.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\n(1a) Lagrangian spheres. By the n-dimensional (Am ) Milnor fibre, we mean the complex\nhypersurface Qnm \u2282 Cn+1 defined by the equation\nx21 + * * * + x2n + xm+1\nn+1 = 1.\n\n(1.1)\n\nThe topology of these manifolds is described by classical singularity theory (see for instance [33]\nor the more recent [3]). Qnm is homotopy equivalent to a wedge of m spheres of dimension n. The\nintersection pairing on Hn (Qnm ) \u223c\n= Zm is given by\n2\n\uf8ec\n\u22121\n(\u22121)n/2 \uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\uf8eb\n\n\u22121\n2\n\u22121\n\n\uf8f6\n\u22121\n2\n\u22121\n\n\u22121\n...\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n(1.2)\n\nif n is even, respectively\n0\n\uf8ec\u22121\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\uf8eb\n\n1\n0\n\u22121\n\n\uf8f6\n1\n0\n\u22121\n\n1\n\n1\n...\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n(1.3)\n\n\fif n is odd. Now let's turn Qnm into a (real) symplectic 2n-manifold in the standard way, by\nusing the restriction of the constant K\u00e4hler form on Cn+1 . These manifolds have become a test\ncase for general techniques in symplectic topology. We will not consider the results that have\nbeen obtained specifically for m = 1, since those belongs to the context of cotangent bundles,\nQn1 \u223c\n= T \u2217S n . With that excluded, relevant papers are [38, 24, 42, 36, 13, 2]. Continuing that\ntradition, we will derive a topological restriction on Lagrangian submanifolds:\nTheorem 1.1. Let L \u2282 Qnm , n \u2265 2, be a Lagrangian submanifold which is a rational homology\nsphere and Spin. Then its homology class [L] \u2208 Hn (Qnm ; Z) \u223c\n= Zm is primitive (nonzero and not\na multiple).\nWe also have an intersection statement, like a form of the Arnol'd conjecture but with very weak\nassumptions:\nTheorem 1.2. Let L0 , L1 be Lagrangian submanifolds as in Theorem 1.1. If [L0 ] = [L1 ] mod 2,\nthen necessarily L0 \u2229 L1 6= \u2205.\nThis yields an upper bound (depending on m) for the number of pairwise disjoint Lagrangian\nsubmanifolds of the relevant type. Note that for even n, both statements have elementary proofs.\nThe first one holds because then, [L] * [L] = (\u22121)n/2 \u03c7(L) = (\u22121)n/2 2. For the second one, note\nthat (1.2) is even. Hence, if [L1 ] = [L0 ] mod 2, then\n0 = ([L1 ] \u2212 [L0 ]) * ([L1 ] \u2212 [L0 ]) = (\u22121)n/2 4 \u2212 2[L0 ] * [L1 ] mod 8,\n\n(1.4)\n\nwhich implies that [L0 ] * [L1 ] = 2 mod 4. One can use the definiteness of (1.2) to analyze the\npossible homology classes in more detail, but that is not required for our purpose.\nMore importantly, for m = 2 and any n \u2265 2, Theorem 1.1 is a consequence of the following\nstronger result of Abouzaid-Smith [2, Corollary 1.5]:\nTheorem 1.3 (Abouzaid-Smith). Any closed Lagrangian submanifold L \u2282 Qn2 , n \u2265 2, whose\nMaslov class vanishes is an integral homology sphere, and has primitive homology class.\nAbouzaid-Smith's results are actually even sharper, and also imply the m = 2 case of Theorem\n1.2. We should say that our point of view is fundamentally similar to theirs, in that we approach\nthe problem via Fukaya categories (in other respects, our argument is quite different). One useful\nfeature of the Fukaya category is that it admits objects which are Lagrangian submanifolds\nequipped with flat complex vector bundles. By applying the same ideas to those, one obtains the\nfollowing:\nTheorem 1.4. Let L \u2282 Qnm , n \u2265 2, be a Lagrangian rational homology sphere which is Spin.\nThen there is no homomorphism \u03c1 : \u03c01 (L) \u2192 C\u2217 such that the associated twisted cohomology is\nacyclic, H \u2217 (L; \u03c1) = 0.\n2\n\n\fTheorem 1.5. Let L \u2282 Qnm , n \u2265 2, be a closed Lagrangian submanifold which is Spin. Then\nthere is no homomorphism \u03c1 : \u03c01 (L) \u2192 GL(r, C), r > 1, such that\n(\nC k = 0, n,\nk\n(1.5)\nH (L; End (\u03c1)) =\n0 otherwise.\nBoth statements are empty for even n, because the conditions imposed can't be satisfied for\nEuler characteristic reasons. Also, even though we have not stated that explicitly, Theorem 1.5\nis again only a statement about rational homology spheres, since H \u2217 (L; End (\u03c1)) always contains\nH \u2217 (L; C) as a direct summand.\nExample 1.6. Consider the lowest nontrivial dimension n = 3. There, Theorems 1.4 and 1.5\ntogether say that L can't be a spherical space form, which means S 3 /\u03c0 for finite \u03c0 \u2282 SO(4) acting\nfreely (the Spin assumption being automatically true in this dimension). Namely, if \u03c0 is abelian\nthen L would be a lens space, to which Theorem 1.4 applies; and if \u03c0 is nonabelian, it has an\nirreducible representation of rank > 1, to which Theorem 1.5 applies.\nExample 1.7. Continuing the previous discussion, Theorem 1.5 also rules out all rational homology 3-spheres which are hyperbolic. To see that, recall that the hyperbolic structure on a\nclosed three-manifold L gives rise to a map \u03c1\u0304 : \u03c01 (L) \u2192 PSL(2, C) which can be lifted to\n\u03c1 : \u03c01 (L) \u2192 SL(2, C). Then H \u2217 (L; End (\u03c1)) \u223c\n= H \u2217 (L; C) \u2295 H \u2217 (L; Ad (\u03c1\u0304)), and the second summand vanishes by Weil's infinitesimal precursor of Mostow rigidity (see for instance [34] for\na statement and further references). However, this particular consequence is not new: since the\ncomplex three-dimensional (Am ) Milnor fibre admits a dilation [47, Example 7.4], it can't contain\nany closed Lagrangian submanifold which is a K(\u03c0, 1) [47, Corollary 6.3].\nWe will now explain the overall nature of our argument. Let Fuk (Qnm ) be the Fukaya category.\nIt is known (see [42, Section 20], which is largely based on [24, 46]) that a certain formal enlargement, the split-closed derived category, which we here denote by Fuk (Qnm )perf , can be explicitly\ndescribed, as the derived category An,perf\nof perfect dg modules over a certain finite-dimensional\nm\nalgebra Anm . Problems about Lagrangian spheres can therefore be approached in a purely algebraic way by looking at spherical objects in An,perf\n. For n = 2, those objects have been\nm\ncompletely classified by Ishii, Ueda and Uehara [16, 17] (for another application of this classification in symplectic topology, see the very recent [29]). Unfortunately, there is no straightforward\nrelation between the categories An,perf\nfor different n. In contrast, if one considers the derived\nm\nn,mod\ncategories Am\nof complexes of graded modules over Anm , and appropriate subcategories An,perf\nm\nof perfect objects inside those, the dependence on n is minimal. Finally, concerning the relation\nbetween An,perf\nand An,perf\n, it is an elementary algebraic observation that the first category can\nm\nm\nbe viewed as \"bigraded\" or \"equivariant\" (for a certain action of C\u2217 ) refinement of the second\none. Given that, the missing ingredient is a way of making objects equivariant, and we will now\nturn to that question in a fairly general context.\n\n3\n\n\f(1b) Equivariant objects. As motivation, consider the following situation. Let X be a smooth\nprojective variety over C, carrying an action of C\u2217 . We denote by Db Coh(X) the bounded derived\ncategory of coherent sheaves, and by Db Coh C\u2217 (X) its equivariant analogue (for consistency with\nthe rest of the paper, we actually want to consider the underlying dg categories, but still use the\nclassical notation). In [35, Lemma 2.2], it was pointed out that the existence of moduli stacks\nfor a suitable class of objects in Db Coh(X) [15, 31] together with a gluing theorem [4, Theorem\n3.2.4] implies the following:\nTheorem 1.8 (Polishchuk). Let E be an object of Db Coh(X) which is rigid and simple, meaning\nthat\n(\nH 1 (hom Db Coh(X) (E, E)) = 0,\n(1.6)\nH 0 (hom Db Coh(X) (E, E)) \u223c\n= C.\nSuppose in addition that H i (hom Db Coh(X) (E, E)) = 0 for all i < 0. Then E is quasi-isomorphic\nto an object coming from Db Coh C\u2217 (X).\nWhat is surprising, at least at first glance, is that there is a single overall condition (1.6) which\nthen implies, a fortiori, equivariance for all the cohomology sheaves H i (E) (if one restricts to\nsheaves, which means objects of the abelian category rather than its derived category, the result\nis easier and more classical; see for instance [7, Appendix (in the preprint version only)], or the\ncase of bundles on homogeneous spaces mentioned in [8]). As pointed out to the author by To\u00ebn,\nthe condition on the negative degree endomorphisms in Theorem 1.8 can be removed by using\nthe more powerful methods of homotopical algebraic geometry. This leads to the following result\n(unpublished, but follows from techniques in [49]):\nTheorem 1.9 (To\u00ebn). Let A be a differential graded algebra over C which is proper (has finitedimensional cohomology) and smooth [26, Definition 8.1.2]. Suppose that it carries an action of\nC\u2217 . Let Aperf be the derived category of perfect dg modules (in this case, that is the same as the\nderived category of dg modules with finite-dimensional cohomology). Let M be a rigid and simple\nobject of Aperf . Then M is quasi-isomorphic to a C\u2217 -equivariant dg module.\nTo be precise, by an action of C\u2217 we meant a linear action which is rational (a direct sum of\nfinite-dimensional representations). Similarly, by an equivariant dg-module we mean one which\ncarries a rational action of C\u2217 compatible with the other structures (later, we will call this a\n\"naive C\u2217 -action\", to distinguish it from other related concepts). The smoothness assumption\non A is required in order to construct finite-dimensional (derived) stacks parametrizing modules.\nHowever, one can argue that the structure of general modules should not be relevant for the\nargument, which only involves M and its pullbacks by the C\u2217 -action. With that in mind, we will\nprove:\nTheorem 1.10. Let A be a dg algebra over C which is proper. Suppose that it carries an action of\nC\u2217 . Let M be a perfect dg module over A which is rigid and simple. Then M is quasi-isomorphic\nto a C\u2217 -equivariant dg module.\n4\n\n\fThe proof follows the same overall strategy as in [35] while remaining elementary throughout. We\nfirst show that M can carry a \"weak C\u2217 -action\". This is done by considering the pullbacks of M\nas a family of modules over C\u2217 . Next, there is an obstruction theory which equips M with a series\nof higher homotopies added to the weak action, corresponding to the use of simplicial methods\nin [35]. Finally, there is an explicit \"gluing\" step which constructs the desired quasi-isomorphic\nmodule. To\u00ebn informs me that his methods can also be adapted to give a proof of Theorem 1.10.\nFinally, to return to symplectic topology, note that our previous results about (Am ) Milnor fibres\nrepresent just one application of Theorem 1.10. There are more situations in which one expects\nFukaya categories of noncompact symplectic manifolds to have C\u2217 -actions, such as the double\nsuspensions considered in [43], and where the same algebraic ideas may be useful (with this\nin mind, Section 5 takes a look at the results one can get for the (Am ) Milnor fibres without\nappealing to [16, 17]).\nAcknowledgments. This work answers a question posed to me by Ivan Smith, who also provided\nthe basic idea of using group actions to attack it (I've probably interpreted that suggestion in a\nmore algebraic way than he would have liked). A conversation with Bertrand To\u00ebn helped me\ngreatly to understand the obstruction theory involved. During the preparation of the paper, I\nwas partially supported by NSF grant DMS-1005288.\n\n2\n\nAlgebraic background\n\n(2a) A\u221e -algebras and modules. We recall some elements of the theory of A\u221e -structures (not\nnew of course, see for instance Keller's papers [21, 20, 23]). We consider A\u221e -algebras A over C,\nassuming for now that they are strictly unital. Our sign conventions follow [42]. In particular,\nthe correspondence between dg algebras and A\u221e -algebras with vanishing compositions of order\n> 2 is given by setting\n\u03bc1A (a) = (\u22121)|a| \u2202A a,\n(2.1)\n\u03bc2A (a2 , a1 ) = (\u22121)|a1 | a2 a1 .\nWe will allow a certain sloppiness in terminology, saying \"A is a dg algebra\" instead of \"A is\nan A\u221e -algebra with vanishing compositions of order > 2, and therefore corresponds to a dg\nalgebra\". Note that conversely, if A is a general A\u221e -algebra, the cohomology H(A) becomes\na graded associative algebra by applying the same sign change as in (2.1) (similar conventions\napply to dg categories and A\u221e -categories). An A\u221e -algebra is called proper if H(A) is of total\nfinite dimension, and weakly proper if H(A) is finite-dimensional in each degree.\nFix an A\u221e -algebra A. A right A\u221e -module M over A is a graded vector space equipped with\noperations\n\u2297d\n\u03bcd+1\n\u2212\u2192 M [1 \u2212 d], d \u2265 0,\n(2.2)\nM :M \u2297A\n\n5\n\n\fsatisfying\nX\n\n(\u22121)|a1 |+***+|ai |\u2212i \u03bcd+2\u2212j\n(m, ad , . . . , \u03bcjA (ai+j , . . . , ai+1 ), ai , . . . , a1 )\nM\n\ni,j\n\n+\n\nX\n\nd+1\u2212i\n(\u22121)|a1 +***+|ai |\u2212i \u03bci+1\n(m, ad , . . . , ai+1 ), ai , . . . , a1 ) = 0.\nM (\u03bcM\n\n(2.3)\n\ni\n\nWe will again impose a strict unitality condition. As before, H(M ) inherits the structure of a\ngraded module over H(A). Right A-modules form a dg category Amod . Also relevant for us\nis the full dg subcategory Aperf \u2282 Amod of perfect modules, defined as follows. Start with the\nfree module A and consider all modules constructed from that by a finite sequence of shifts and\nmapping cones. M is perfect if, in H 0 (Amod ), it is isomorphic to a direct summand of one of\nthe previously constructed objects. If M0 is perfect and (M1,i )i\u2208I is an arbitrary collection of\nmodules, the natural map\nM\nM\nM1,i )\n(2.4)\nhom Amod (M0 , M1,i ) \u2212\u2192 hom Amod (M0 ,\ni\u2208I\n\ni\u2208I\n\nis a quasi-isomorphism. This is the compactness property of perfect A\u221e -modules (a more general\nversion of which actually characterizes them among all modules; see the parallel discussion for\ndg modules in [23]).\nOne can generalize both Amod and Aperf to the case where A is an A\u221e -category. The former can\nbe defined as the category of contravariant A\u221e -functors from A to chain complexes. The latter is\nthe full subcategory of objects built from those in the image of the Yoneda embedding A \u2192 Amod\nin the same way as before (by shifts, mapping cones, and taking direct summands). Alternatively,\none can first introduce the A\u221e -category Atw of twisted complexes, which is a natural enlargement\nof A itself closed under shifts and mapping cones. There is a canonical A\u221e -functor Atw \u2192 Amod\nwhich extends the Yoneda embedding, and using that one shows that Aperf is quasi-equivalent\nto the split-closure (Karoubi completion on the A\u221e -level) of Atw .\n(2b) Relation to classical derived categories. Let's temporarily restrict to the case when\nA is a dg algebra. In that case, an A\u221e -module with \u03bcd+1\nM = 0 for all d > 1 is the same as a dg\nmodule; or more precisely, the two structures are related by a sign change as in (2.1). Let K(A)\nbe the dg category of dg modules over A (morphisms are maps compatible with multiplication\nwith elements of A), and D(A) the dg derived category, formed by quotienting out K(A) by\nacyclic complexes as in [19, 12]. The obvious functor K(A) \u2192 Amod induces a functor\nD(A) \u2212\u2192 Amod .\n\n(2.5)\n\nIt is a well-known fact that this is a quasi-equivalence. The main ingredient in the proof is\nthe following quite general observation. Given any A\u221e -algebra A and A\u221e -module M , one can\n\n6\n\n\fconstruct another module\nM\ndef\nM \u2297A A =\nM \u2297 A[1]\u2297l \u2297 A,\nl\u22650\n\n\u03bc1M \u2297A A (m\n\n\u2297 \u0101l \u2297 * * * \u2297 \u01011 \u2297 a) =\nX\n=\n(\u22121)|a|+|\u01011 |+***+|\u0101i |\u2212i \u03bcl\u2212i+1\n(m, \u0101l , . . . , \u0101i+1 ) \u2297 \u0101i \u2297 * * * \u2297 a\nM\ni\n\n+\n\nX\n\n+\n\nX\n\n(\u22121)|a|+|\u01011 |+***+|\u0101i |\u2212i m \u2297 \u0101l \u2297 * * * \u2297 \u0101i+j+1 \u2297 \u03bcjA (\u0101i+j , . . . , \u0101i+1 ) \u2297 \u0101i \u2297 * * * \u2297 a (2.6)\n\ni,j\n\nm \u2297 \u0101l \u2297 * * * \u2297 \u0101i+1 \u2297 \u03bci+1\nA (\u0101i , . . . , a),\n\ni\n\n\u03bcd+1\nM \u2297A A (m \u2297 \u0101l \u2297 * * * \u2297 \u01011 \u2297 a, ad , . . . , a1 ) =\nX\n=\nm \u2297 \u0101l \u2297 * * * \u2297 \u0101i+1 \u2297 \u03bci+1+d\n(\u0101i , . . . , \u01011 , a, ad , . . . , a1 )\nA\n\nfor d > 0.\n\ni\n\nThis comes with a canonical quasi-isomorphism M \u2297A A \u2192 M [41, Equation (2.21)]. In the case\nwhen A is a dg algebra, M \u2297A A is always a dg module. Moreover, if the original M was a dg\nmodule, the quasi-isomorphism M \u2297A A \u2192 M is itself a dg module map. This provides an inverse\n(up to quasi-isomorphism of dg functors) to the more obvious functor (2.5).\nLet's specialize even further, to the case where our A\u221e -algebra is a graded algebra, meaning that\n\u03bc2A is the only nonzero structure map. One can then introduce another dg category Amod (this is\nthe start of a general notational convention, where bold stands roughly for bigraded structures).\nTo do that, think of A itself as being bigraded, with bidegrees of the form (0, s) where s is the\noriginal grading. Objects of Amod are bigraded vector spaces M together with maps \u03bcd+1\nM as in\n(2.2) which have bidegree (1 \u2212 d, 0). These should satisfy equations as in (2.3), where the sum of\nthe two degrees is used in determining all the relevant signs. The bigraded space H r,s (M) has\nthe property that each piece H r,\u2217 (M) is a graded A-module in the classical sense. As a special\ncase, objects which have vanishing structure maps \u03bcd+1\nM for d > 1 correspond bijectively to chain\ncomplexes of graded A-modules. An element \u03c6 \u2208 hom kAmod (M0 , M1 ) is a collection of maps\n\u03c6d+1 : M0 \u2297 A\u2297d \u2212\u2192 M1\n\n(2.7)\n\nof bidegrees (k\u2212d, 0). The dg category structure of Amod is given by the same formulae as for ordinary A\u221e -modules, again taking the sum of the two gradings into account when determining signs.\nGiven any object M, one can form two kinds of shifts M[1] and M{1}. The first one shifts the first\ngrading downwards, and has the usual property that hom Amod (\u2212, M[1]) = hom Amod (\u2212, M)[1].\nThe second one shifts the second grading upwards (by convention). For instance, for the free\nmodule A there is a natural isomorphism\nH r (hom Amod (A{s}, M)) \u223c\n= H r (hom Amod (A, M{\u2212s})) \u223c\n= H r,s (M).\n\n(2.8)\n\nOne also has a full subcategory Aperf , which consists of objects that can be constructed starting\nfrom the free module by shifts (both kinds), mapping cones, and taking direct summands. As\n7\n\n\fbefore, the entire construction turns out to be equivalent to one from classical homological algebra.\nLet K(A) be the dg category of (unbounded) chain complexes of graded A-modules, and D(A)\nthe associated (dg) derived category. In parallel with (2.5), the obvious functor K(A) \u2192 Amod\ninduces a quasi-equivalence\nD(A) \u2212\u2192 Amod .\n(2.9)\nThis is well-known in the case where A has trivial grading (stated in [21, 22] without proof, but\nsee [20, Proposition 7.4] for a full proof of the analogous statement for bimodules). Again, the\nkey fact is that for any object M one can construct another one M \u2297A A which lies in the image\nof (2.9). Moreover, the image of the full subcategory of bounded complexes of finitely generated\nprojective modules, which we denote by Perf (A), is quasi-equivalent to Aperf . This follows from\nthe characterization as subcategories of compact objects (again, this may be most familiar in the\ncase of algebras with trivial grading).\nAny graded algebra can be considered as a dg algebra with vanishing differential, and in that\ncontext we can compare the two previously discussed constructions. There are natural functors\nwhich collapse the bigradings, and these fit into a commutative diagram\n/ D(A)\n\nD(A)\n\u000f\n\n\u223c\n=\n\n\u000f\n\n(2.10)\n\n\u223c\n=\n\n/ Amod .\n\nAmod\n\nFor simplicity, let's consider the top line of this diagram. The collapsing process takes a complex\nr\n{Mr , \u2202M\n: Mr \u2192 Mr+1 } of graded A-modules, and associates to it the total graded vector\nL\nt\nM = r+s=t Mr,s made into a dg module in the obvious way. If M0 and M1 are obtained in\nthis way, we have a quasi-isomorphism\nM\nM1 {j}[j]).\n(2.11)\nhom D(A) (M0 , M1 ) \u223c\n= hom D(A) (M0 ,\nj\n\nBy projecting to each summand Mj {j}[j], one sees that there is an injective map\nM\nH i (hom D(A) (M0 {j}, M1 )) \u2212\u2192 H k (hom D(A) (M0 , M1 )).\n\n(2.12)\n\ni+j=k\n\nIf M0 is an object of Aperf , this map is an isomorphism by compactness. One slight cautionary\nremark concerning the multiplicative structures is appropriate: the diagram\nH i2 (hom D(A) (M1 {j2 }, M2 ))\n\u2297 H i1 (hom D(A) (M0 {j1 }, M1 ))\n\n/ H i1 +i2 (hom D(A) (M0 {j1 + j2 }, M2 ))\n\n\u000f\nH i2 +j2 (hom D(A) (M1 , M2 ))\n\u2297 H i1 +j1 (hom D(A) (M0 , M1 ))\n\n\u000f\n/ H i1 +i2 +j1 +j2 (hom D(A) (M0 , M2 ))\n\n8\n\n(2.13)\n\n\fcommutes only up to a sign (\u22121)i1 j2 . These signs come from the chain level realization of (2.12).\nNamely, take a class [\u03c6] of bidegree (i, j) on the left hand side of the map, and suppose for\nsimplicity that this is represented by an actual map of chain complexes \u03c6. The associated dg\nmodule homomorphism \u03c6 is given by \u03c6(m0 ) = (\u22121)j|m0 |1 \u03c6(m0 ), where |m0 |1 is the first grading.\nRemark 2.1. Given any graded algebra A, one can define a whole family An of graded algebras\nsimply by multiplying the degrees by a nonzero integer n. Any graded module over A can be made\ninto a graded module over An in the same way. Conversely, any graded module over An can be\nwritten as a finite direct sum of objects which come from A, with some shifts. On the level of the\nabelian categories Mod (*) of graded modules, the resulting relationship is simply that\nMod (An ) \u223c\n=\n\nn\u22121\nM\n\nMod (A).\n\n(2.14)\n\ni=0\n\nThe associated derived categories then inherit a corresponding relationship. In particular, any\nindecomposable object of D(An ) ' An,mod comes from D(A) ' Amod . Similarly, any indecomposable object of An,perf comes from Aperf . Note that in contrast, there is no direct relationship\nbetween the categories of dg modules over A and An .\nRemark 2.2. One important class of examples, Fukaya categories, do not (at least when constructed in the most obvious way) satisfy strict unitality, and instead are only unital on the cohomology level. In that case, one should instead consider cohomologically unital modules. Note that\nevery cohomologically unital A\u221e -algebra is quasi-isomorphic to a strictly unital one. Moreover,\nif an A\u221e -algebra is strictly unital, it does not make a difference whether one considers strictly\nunital or cohomologically unital modules (the corresponding categories are quasi-equivalent). We\nrefer to [27] for an extensive discussion.\n\n3\n\n(Am )-algebras and hypersurfaces\n\n(3a) Algebraic definition. Fix m \u2265 3, n \u2265 1. Define a finite-dimensional graded algebra\nA = Anm over C as the quotient of the path algebra of the following graded quiver:\n\u2022s\n1\n\nn\n0\n\n3\u2022r\n2\n\nn\n\n2 *** r\n\n0\n\nm\u22121\n1 \u2022 q\n\nm\n\n2 \u2022\n\n(3.1)\n\nOur convention is that we write paths from right to left, so (3|2|1) is the length two path going\nfrom the first to the third vertex. With this mind, the grading is such that |(k + 1|k)| = 0,\n|(k|k + 1)| = n. We define A by imposing the relations\n(k|k + 1|k + 2) = 0, (k + 2|k + 1|k) = 0, (k|k + 1|k) = (k|k \u2212 1|k).\n\n(3.2)\n\nThis can be extended to lower values of m as follows. For m = 2, take the same quiver (3.1)\nbut with relations (1|2|1|2) = 0, (2|1|2|1) = 0. Finally, for m = 1 one sets An1 = C[t]/t2 with t a\n9\n\n\fgenerator of degree n (this may seem ad hoc, but the resulting algebras do fit in naturally with\nthe general case m \u2265 3).\nConsider the derived category D(A) of right graded modules, which as usual for us is a dg\ncategory. As explained in [24, 37], this category carries a weak action of the braid group Br m+1 .\nThe generators \u03c3k \u2208 Br m+1 act by twist functors TPk along the modules Pk = (k)A, which means\nthat for any object M one has an exact triangle\n/ TP (M)\nk\n\nMh\n\n(3.3)\n\n[1]\nu\nj\nH\n(hom\n(P\n{i},\nM))\n\u2297\nP\nk\nk {i}[\u2212j]\nD(A)\ni,j\n\nL\n\nMore simply put, H j (hom D(A) (Pk {i}, M)) \u223c\n= H i,j (M)(k) as vector space, and we take the associated direct sum of appropriately shifted copies of Pk as the bottom term in (3.3).\nLemma 3.1. Take the central element \u03b4 = (\u03c31 . . . \u03c3m )m+1 \u2208 Br m+1 . Then, \u03b4 2 acts by a functor\nisomorphic to the shift [4m]{(2m + 2)n}.\nSketch of proof. This falls in the \"well-known to specialists\" category, but since there seems to\nbe no direct reference, we will sketch a proof. One can show, either by direct computation or by\nappealing to the geometric interpretation of the braid group action given in [24], that there are\nquasi-isomorphisms\n\u03b4(Pk ) \u223c\n(3.4)\n= Pk [2m]{(m + 1)n} for all k.\nLet \u03c6 : D(A) \u2192 D(A) be the action of \u03b4 composed with the inverse shift [\u22122m]{\u2212(m + 1)n}.\nThen, (3.4) says that \u03c6 maps the free module A to itself (and moreover that is compatible with\nits decomposition A = P1 \u2295 * * * \u2295 Pm ). General homological algebra says that then, \u03c6 must be\nquasi-isomorphic to the functor induced by an automorphism of the algebra A (and moreover,\nthat automorphism must act trivially on the vertices of our quiver). By composing with inner\nautomorphisms, which do not affect the isomorphism type of the associated functor, we can\nfurther restrict to automorphisms which act trivially on the paths (k + 1|k). Such automorphisms\nare then uniquely determined by their action on C(k|k \u00b1 1|k) = H 0 (hom D(A) (Pk {n}, Pk )). To\nsee that \u03c62 acts trivially, one can either do an explicit computation similar to (3.4), or else note\nthat everything can be carried out with coefficients in Z rather than C, which shows that the\nautomorphism of C(k|k \u00b1 1|k) associated to \u03c6 is necessarily \u00b11.\nThis leads to the following useful technical criterion:\nLemma 3.2. An object M of D(A) is perfect if and only if it has the following two properties:\ndimC H \u2217 (M) < \u221e,\nM\ndimC\nH \u2217 (hom D(A) (M, M{i})) < \u221e.\ni\n\n10\n\n(3.5)\n(3.6)\n\n\fProof. It is obvious that perfect objects have those two properties, so only the converse is of\ninterest. Suppose that M satisfies (3.5), (3.6). By combining exact triangles (3.3), we arrive at\na triangle of the form\nMe\n\n/ \u03b4 2t (M) \u223c\n= M[4mt]{(2m + 2)nt}\n\nt\n\u0013\n\u0012\nan object built by mapping\ncones and shifts from the Pk\n\n(3.7)\n\n[1]\n\nHere, we have used (3.5) to ensure that the bottom term in each triangle (3.3) is a finite direct\nsum of shifted copies of Pk . Now, (3.6) implies that if we make t large, the horizontal arrow in\n(3.7) vanishes. In that case M is a direct summand of the bottom object, hence perfect (this is\na slight variation of a familiar split-generation argument [42, Corollary 5.8]).\nThe algebras A = Anm occur in a variety of contexts. To understand that, it is maybe useful\nto recall some material from [46]. Let D be a cohomologically unital A\u221e -category over C. An\nobject Z of D is called spherical of some dimension n > 0 [46, Definition 2.9] if it satisfies the\nfollowing conditions: H \u2217 (hom D (Y, Z)) and H \u2217 (hom D (Z, Y )) are of finite total dimension for any\nY ; H \u2217 (hom D (Z, Z)) \u223c\n= H \u2217 (S n ; C) has one generator in degrees 0 and n, respectively; and finally,\nthe composition\nH n\u2212\u2217 (hom D (Y, Z)) \u2297 H \u2217 (hom D (Z, Y )) \u2212\u2192 H n (hom D (Z, Z)) \u223c\n=C\n\n(3.8)\n\nis a nondegenerate pairing for any Y . An (Am ) chain of spherical objects [46, Equation (2.8)] is\nan ordered collection (Z1 , . . . , Zm ) of spherical objects of the same dimension n, such that\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4one-dimensional, concentrated in degree 0 j = i + 1,\n\uf8f2\nH \u2217 (hom D (Zi , Zj )) =\n\none-dimensional, concentrated in degree n\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f30\n\nj = i \u2212 1,\n\n(3.9)\n\n|i \u2212 j| \u2265 2.\n\nWe then have the following formality result [46, Lemma 4.21]:\nLemma 3.3. Let (Z1 , . . . , Zm ) be an (Am )-chain, with n \u2265 2. Then the endomorphism algebra\nL\nof Z = k Zk is quasi-isomorphic to A. In particular, we get a cohomologically full and faithful\nembedding Aperf \u2192 Dperf , which sends Pk to Zk .\nThis is false for n = 1, as demonstrated by the examples in [42, Section 20] (m \u2265 5) and [30]\n(m \u2265 2).\n(3b) Algebraic geometry. We temporarily restrict to n = 2, and explain the algebro-geometric\ninterpretation of A = A2m . Consider the quotient C2 /(Z/m + 1) by a cyclic subgroup (which is\nunique up to conjugacy) Z/m + 1 \u2282 SL2 (C). Let\nq : X \u2212\u2192 C2 /(Z/m + 1)\n11\n\n(3.10)\n\n\fbe the minimal resolution, and C = q \u22121 (0) \u2282 X the exceptional divisor, which is a chain of m\nrational curves C = C1 \u222a * * * \u222a Cm . Start with the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves\non X with support on C, and denote by D the full subcategory of objects E such that q\u2217 E is\nacyclic (as usual, we really mean the underlying chain level dg category).\nLemma 3.4 (Ishii-Ueda-Uehara). D is quasi-equivalent to Aperf .\nSketch of proof. As stated in [17, Section 2.2], D is generated by the objects\nZ1 = OC1 (\u22121)[1], . . . , Zm = OCm (\u22121)[m].\n\n(3.11)\n\nNote that if X\u0304 is a compactification of X to a smooth projective algebraic surface, the bounded\nderived category of coherent sheaves on X with support on C is the same as the bounded derived\ncategory of coherent sheaves on X\u0304 whose cohomology is supported on C (see e.g. [6, Lemma\n3]). The latter is split-closed (Karoubi complete, in other words) by general results from [9].\nMoreover, the condition that q\u2217 E should be acyclic is obviously preserved under passing to direct\nsummands, so it follows that D is split-closed as well.\nThe rest of the argument is explained in [17, Lemma 40]. The objects (3.11) form an (Am ) chain\nof spherical objects. One applies Lemma 3.3 to get a cohomologically full and faithful embedding\nAperf \u2192 Dperf . Our previous observations about D show that D ' Dperf , and because of the\ngeneration statement, one gets a quasi-equivalence.\nProposition 3.5 (Ishii-Ueda-Uehara). Consider objects E of D which are nonzero and such that\nH \u2217 (hom D (E, E)) has total dimension \u2264 2. The action of Br m+1 on D generated by the TZk acts\ntransitively on quasi-isomorphism classes of such objects up to shifts.\nDue to Serre duality, the conditions on E imply that it must be a spherical object. With that in\nmind, the result is a reformulation of [17, Lemma 38], which in turn relies on results of [16].\n(3c) Symplectic geometry. For the following discussion, we assume n \u2265 2. Consider Q = Qnm\nas defined in (1.1). Take \u03c9Q to be the restriction of the constant K\u00e4hler form on Cn+1 . It\nis well-known [38, 24] that Q contains Lagrangian spheres (V1 , . . . , Vm ) which form an (Am )\nconfiguration. This means that they are pairwise transverse and\n(\nVk \u2229 Vk\u00b11 = {point},\n(3.12)\nVj \u2229 Vk = \u2205 if |j \u2212 k| \u2265 2.\nThe homology classes [Vk ] form a basis of Hn (Q; Z), which is in fact the basis in which we had\nwritten the intersection form in (1.2). Symplectically, one can think of Q as the plumbing of the\nVk . We will not explain in detail what the plumbing construction means, but one of its main\nfeatures is this:\n\n12\n\n\fLemma 3.6. Take any symplectic manifold\nmeaning that \u03c9M = d\u03b8M , and the Liouville\npositive times. Moreover, it contains an (Am )\nThen there is a symplectic embedding Q \u2192 M\n\nM 2n with the following properties. It is exact,\nvector field dual to \u03b8M can be integrated for all\nconfiguration of Lagrangian spheres (L1 , . . . , Lm ).\nwhich sends each Vk to Lk .\n\nSketch of proof. The local structure near any two (Am ) configurations being the same, one finds\na symplectic embedding U \u2192 M , where U \u2282 Q is a neighbourhood of V1 \u222a V2 \u222a * * * \u222a Vm , which\nsends Vk to Lk . The next step is the one we were referring to above, when mentioning plumbing.\nNamely, one can choose U and a one-form \u03b8Q with d\u03b8Q = \u03c9Q so that the following holds: \u2202U is a\ncontact type hypersurface for the associated Liouville vector field, and the flow of that vector field\nyields a diffeomorphism [0, \u221e) \u00d7 \u2202U \u2192 Q \\ U . Given that, take a compactly supported function\nK on M such that \u03b8M + dK restricts to \u03b8Q on \u016a . Using the Liouville vector field associated to\n\u03b8M + dK, the given embedding can be extended to the whole of Q.\nIn fact, we will only use a particular consequence of this, namely the existence of symplectic\nembeddings Qnm \u2192 Qnm+1 , which can also be established in other ways.\nTo define the Fukaya category, we should choose an almost complex structure JQ with suitable\nconvexity properties (to prevent pseudo-holomorphic discs from escaping to infinity). In our\ncase, the standard complex structure will do. We should also choose a complex volume form \u03b7Q\n(even though \u03b7Q is required in the definition, any two choices lead to quasi-isomorphic Fukaya\ncategories, since H 1 (Q) = 0). Objects of Fuk (Q) are closed Lagrangian submanifolds L \u2282 Q\nwhich are exact (the relative class [\u03c9Q ] \u2208 H 2 (Q, L; R) vanishes) and graded with respect to\n\u03b7Q . The grading induces an orientation on L, and we require the additional choice of a Spin\nstructure, as well as a representation \u03c1 : \u03c01 (L) \u2192 GLr (C) (for some choice of base point and\nsome r = rank(\u03c1) \u2265 1; equivalently one can work with flat complex vector bundles). Morphisms\nin Fuk (Q) are Floer cochain complexes with their natural differential, so that\nH \u2217 (hom Fuk (Q) (L0 , L1 )) \u223c\n= HF \u2217 (L0 , L1 ).\n\n(3.13)\n\n\u03c7(HF \u2217 (L0 , L1 )) = (\u22121)n(n+1)/2 rank(\u03c10 )rank(\u03c11 ) [L0 ] * [L1 ],\n\n(3.14)\n\nThe Euler characteristic is\n\nwhere \u03c1k are the representations on Lk (this agrees with the intuitive way of thinking of the objects\nas Lagrangian submanifolds with multiplicities). Next, if L0 and L1 have the same underlying\nLagrangian submanifold L, grading and Spin structure, but come equipped with representations\n\u03c10 , \u03c11 , then Floer cohomology agrees with the ordinary cohomology with twisted coefficients:\nHF \u2217 (L0 , L1 ) \u223c\n= H \u2217 (L; Hom(\u03c10 , \u03c11 )).\n\n(3.15)\n\n(3.14) is straightforward from the definition, wheras (3.15) can be proved by adapting any of the\narguments that are familiar for the case of trivial representations.\n13\n\n\fLemma 3.7. There is a quasi-equivalence\n\u223c\n=\n\nAn,perf\n\u2212\u2192 Fuk (Qnm )perf .\nm\n\n(3.16)\n\nwhich sends the modules Pk to the Lagrangian spheres Vk .\nSketch of proof. This is proved in [42, Section 20] for the Fukaya category without flat vector\nbundles. We briefly summarize the argument, in order to explain how it extends to the case\nconsidered here. Make the Vk into objects of Fuk (Q), choosing the gradings in such a way\nthat HF \u2217 (Vk , Vk+1 ) \u223c\n= C lies in degree 0. Because of general Poincar\u00e9 duality properties of\nFloer cohomology, they then form an (Am )-chain of spherical objects, and Lemma 3.3 yields a\ncohomologically full and faithful embedding as in (3.16).\nThe Dehn twists \u03c4Vk satisfy braid relations up to isotopy, hence generate a homomorphism\nBr m+1 \u2192 \u03c00 (Symp c (M )). On the level of the action on objects of the Fukaya category, the\nDehn twists can be identified with the algebraic twists TVk . This follows from [42, Corollary\n17.17], ultimately a consequence of the long exact sequence for Floer cohomology groups [39]. To\nbe precise, in order to apply to the current context the exact sequence should be generalized so\nto allow Lagrangian submanifolds with flat line bundles, but that is straightforward. One can\nshow that the composition of Dehn twists corresponding to the central element \u03b4 2 \u2208 Br m+1 is\nisotopic to a nontrivial shift [4m \u2212 (2m + 2)n] in the graded symplectic automorphism group\nof M [42, Section 20a] (the geometric analogue of Lemma 3.1). This implies that the Vk are\nsplit-generators, hence that the previously constructed embedding is a quasi-equivalence.\n\n4\n\nProofs of the main theorems\n\n(4a) Algebraic results. Take A = Anm for some m, n \u2265 2. We will now consider spherical\nobjects in Aperf . This relies on our general equivariance theorems to reduce to the case n = 2,\nwhere the algebro-geometric results of Ishii-Ueda-Uehara can be applied.\nLemma 4.1. Let M0 be an object of Aperf , with H \u2217 (hom Aperf (M0 , M0 )) \u223c\n= H \u2217 (S n ; C) as a\ngraded vector space. Suppose that m 6= 1. Then there is another object M1 , obtained from the\nmodule P1 by applying some autoequivalence in the group generated by TP1 , . . . , TPm , such that\nH \u2217 (hom Aperf (M0 , M1 )) has dimension exactly 1.\nProof. The main step is to use Theorem 1.10, which applies to our case as described in Example\n7.3. The outcome is that there is some M0 in Amod which maps to M0 under the collapsing\nmap Amod \u2192 Amod . By definition of that functor, the cohomology of M0 is a bigraded version\nof that of M0 , hence finite-dimensional. Moreover, because of the general injectivity of (2.12),\nwe know that\nM\ndimC\nH \u2217 (hom Amod (M0 , M0 {i})) \u2264 2.\n(4.1)\ni\n\n14\n\n\fIn view of Lemma 3.2, it follows that M0 lies in Aperf . Since (2.12) is an isomorphism for perfect\nmodules, this also shows that equality holds in (4.1). Note that in particular, M0 is nonzero and\nindecomposable (since all its endomorphisms of bidegree (0, 0) are multiples of the identity).\nWrite \u0100 = A2m , and P\u0304k = (k)\u0100. Remark 2.1 allows us to transfer indecomposable objects from\nAmod to \u0100mod , while preserving the total dimension of the cohomology and of bigraded morphism\nspaces. Therefore, we get a corresponding object M\u03040 of \u0100mod , which still has finite-dimensional\ncohomology, and bigraded endomorphism space of total dimension 2. Again applying Lemma 3.2,\none finds that M\u03040 lies in \u0100perf . Let's collapse the bigrading and consider the associated object\nM\u03040 of \u0100perf .\nProposition 3.5 and Lemma 3.4 apply, showing that there is some autoequivalence \u03c6 of \u0100perf\ngenerated by TP\u03041 , . . . , TP\u0304m , such that \u03c6(M\u03040 ) \u223c\n= P\u03041 [s] for some s. Take M\u03041 = \u03c6\u22121 (P\u03042 ). Because\nit is constructed through a sequence of twists along the P\u0304k , it is easy to see that M\u03041 lifts to an\nobject M\u03041 of \u0100perf . Again using the fact that (2.12) is an isomorphism for perfect modules, one\nsees that\nM\n(4.2)\ndimC\nH \u2217 (hom \u0100perf (M\u03040 , M\u03041 {i})) = 1.\ni\n\nThere is a corresponding object M1 in Aperf constructed using the same sequence of twists, and\nthe pair (M0 , M1 ) will satisfy the analogue of (4.2). The image M1 of M\u03041 in Aperf has the\ndesired property.\nRemark 4.2. In principle, one could try to replace Theorem 1.10 by an application of its algebrogeometric counterpart, Theorem 1.8. As an example, consider the three-dimensional case. One\ncan find a smooth toric Calabi-Yau threefold U and compactly supported sheaves Z1 ,. . . ,Zm on\nit, which form an (Am ) configuration of spherical objects in the category Db Coh(U ), see the\ndiscussion in [46, Section 3f]. As part of the toric symmetry, this carries an action of G = C\u2217\nwhich acts with weight 3 on a suitably chosen holomorphic volume form on U . Choose a smooth\ntoric compactification X \u2283 U . One gets cohomologically full and faithful embeddings\n\u001f\nA3,perf\nm\n\n\u007f\n\n/ Db Coh G (X)\n\n(4.3)\n\n\u000f\n/ Db Coh(X)\n\n\u000f\n\u001f\u007f\nA3,perf\nm\n\nGiven an object M of A3,perf\nwhose endomorphism ring is H \u2217 (S 3 ; C), one can first map it to\nm\nb\nan object E of D Coh(X), and then use Theorem 1.8 to lift E to an object E of Db Coh G (X).\nOne knows as in Lemma 3.1 that a suitable composition of twist functors along the Zk takes E to\nitself up to a nontrivial shift [\u22122m \u2212 6]. Given that the Zk can be made into equivariant objects\nZk , one can then apply the same argument as in the proof of Lemma 3.2 to show that E lies\nin the subcategory split-generated by the twisted versions Zk \u2297 \u03c7l (for 1 \u2264 k \u2264 m, and l \u2208 Z\n3,perf\nparametrizing characters of G), which means in the image of the embedding of Am\n. This\n3,perf\nprovides a lift M of M to Am\n. We will not pursue this trick further, because it is artificial\n15\n\n\fand only an apparent simplification: the proof of Theorem 1.8 given in [35], while a good deal\nshorter, relies on tools that are more abstract than our proof of Theorem 1.10.\nLemma 4.3. Let M0 , M1 be two objects of Aperf such that H \u2217 (hom Aperf (Mi , Mi )) \u223c\n= H \u2217 (S n ; C).\nSuppose that m is even. Suppose also that for all k,\ndimC H \u2217 (hom Aperf (Pk , M0 )) \u2261 dimC H \u2217 (hom Aperf (Pk , M1 )) mod 2.\n\n(4.4)\n\nThen H \u2217 (hom Aperf (M0 , M1 )) is nonzero.\nProof. Arguing exactly as in Lemma 4.1, one can reduce the situation to the case n = 2, which\nwe will concentrate on for the rest of the argument. One can then use Lemma 3.5 (and the\ncorrespondence between Dehn twists and twist functors) to show that the images of Mi under\nthe quasi-equivalence Aperf \u223c\n= Fuk (Q2m )perf are quasi-isomorphic to Lagrangian spheres Li . The\nassumption (4.4) translates to\n[Vk ] * [L0 ] \u2261 [Vk ] * [L1 ] mod 2.\n\n(4.5)\n\nThe intersection form on H2 (Q2m ), written down in (1.2), has determinant (\u22121)m (m + 1), which\nis odd for even m. Hence (4.5) implies that [L0 ] \u2261 [L1 ] mod 2. As already explained in (1.4), we\nthen have [L0 ] * [L1 ] 6= 0, hence HF \u2217 (L0 , L1 ) 6= 0, which means H \u2217 (hom Aperf (M0 , M1 )) 6= 0.\n(4b) Geometric applications. We consider the manifolds Q = Qnm , where m \u2265 1 and n \u2265 2.\nProof of Theorem 1.1. Assume first that m \u2265 2. Let L0 \u2282 Q be a Lagrangian submanifold\nwhich is a rational homology sphere and Spin. Lemma 4.1 implies that there is a Lagrangian\nsphere L1 (in fact one obtained from the Vk by the braid group action) such that HF \u2217 (L0 , L1 ) is\none-dimensional. Passing to Euler characteristics implies the desired result. The remaining case\nm = 1 is known already [40], but one could also derive it by embedding Qn1 = T \u2217S n ,\u2192 Qn2 .\nProof of Theorem 1.2. Suppose first that m is even. By assumption, [Vk ] * [L0 ] = [Vk ] * [L1 ] mod\n2 for all k. Lemma 4.3 then implies that HF \u2217 (L0 , L1 ) 6= 0. One extends the argument to odd m\nby embedding Qnm ,\u2192 Qnm+1 , which is possible by Lemma 3.6.\nProof of Theorem 1.4. Again, we may assume without loss of generality that m is even. Take two\nobjects L0 , L1 of Fuk (Q), both of which have the same underlying Lagrangian submanifold L and\nSpin structure, but where the first one carries the trivial representation, and the second one the\ngiven representation \u03c1. From (3.14) one sees that dim HF \u2217 (Vk , L0 ) \u2261 dim HF \u2217 (Vk , L1 ) mod 2 for\nall k. By the same argument as in the proof of Theorem 1.2, this implies that HF \u2217 (L0 , L1 ) 6= 0,\ncontradicting (3.15).\n\n16\n\n\fProof of Theorem 1.5. Without loss of generality, assume that m \u2265 2. Let L0 be the object\nobtained by taking our Lagrangian submanifold and equipping it with the representation \u03c1. By\narguing as in the proof of Theorem 1.1, one sees that there is a Lagrangian sphere L1 such that\nHF \u2217 (L0 , L1 ) is one-dimensional. But that contradicts (3.14).\nEspecially in view of possible extensions to other symplectic manifolds, it may be interesting to\nsee how far one can get without appealing to Proposition 3.5. This will be the subject of the\nnext section (however, since the discussion there is not essential for the results of this paper, we\nwill allow a more sketchy treatment).\n\n5\n\nA variant approach\n\n(5a) Hochschild homology. For an A\u221e -algebra A one defines the Hochschild homology\nH\u2217 (A, A) as the cohomology of the chain complex\nM\nC\u2217 (A, A) =\nA[1]\u2297l \u2297 A,\nl\u22650\n\n\u2202C\u2217 (A,A) (\u0101l \u2297 * * * \u2297 \u01011 \u2297 a) =\nX\n=\n(\u22121)|a|+|\u01011 |+***+|\u0101i |\u2212i \u0101l \u2297 * * * \u2297 \u03bcjA (\u0101i+j , . . . , \u0101i+1 ) \u2297 * * * \u2297 \u01011 \u2297 a\n\n(5.1)\n\ni,j\n\n\u2212\n\nX\n(\u22121)(|\u0101l\u2212j+1 |+***+|\u0101l |\u2212j)(|a|+|\u01011 |+***+|\u0101l\u2212j |+l\u2212j+1) \u0101l\u2212j \u2297 * * * \u2297 \u0101i+1\ni,j\n\n\u2297 \u03bc1+i+j\n(\u0101i , . . . , a, \u0101l , . . . , \u0101l\u2212j+1 ).\nA\n\n(In spite of being written as a subscript, this is a cohomological grading in our conventions,\nso \u2202C\u2217 (A,A) has degree +1). This easily generalizes to A\u221e -categories (using composable closed\nchains of morphisms), which is the context we will work in from now on. For any twisted complex\nC we have a canonical map\nhom Atw (C, C) \u2212\u2192 C\u2217 (A, A).\n(5.2)\nExplicitly, let\nC=\n\nM\n\nXf ,\n\n\u0001\n\u03b4C = \u03b4C,f1 ,f0 \u2208 hom 1A (Xf0 , Xf1 ) ,\n\n(5.3)\n\nf \u2208F\n\nwhere F is some finite set, and the Xf are objects of A (this is not quite the most general form\nof a twisted complex, since we have not shifted the Xf ; however, including shifts just introduces\nsome additional signs). Then (5.2) takes an endomorphism a = (af1 ,f0 ) of C to the Hochschild\nchain\nX X\n\u03b4C,fl ,fl\u22121 \u2297 * * * \u2297 \u03b4C,f1 ,f0 \u2297 af0 ,fl\n(5.4)\nl\n\nf0 ,...,fl \u2208F\n\n(the sum terminates at some value of l because of the upper triangularity condition on \u03b4C , which\nis part of the definition of a twisted complex). One application is to consider a cohomology level\n17\n\n\fidempotent endomorphism [a] \u2208 H 0 (hom Atw (C, C)). After applying the embedding Atw \u2192 Aperf ,\nthis endomorphism defines a direct summand of C, which is a perfect module M unique up to\nquasi-isomorphism. We denote the image of [a] under (5.2) by\n[M ]alg \u2208 H0 (A, A).\n\n(5.5)\n\nLemma 5.1. [M ]alg depends only on the isomorphism class of M in H 0 (Aperf ).\nSketch of proof. Consider first a simpler special case, namely that of an idempotent endomorphism [a] of an object X of A itself. In that case, (5.2) reduces to the map hom A (X, X) \u2192\nC\u2217 (A, A) given by inclusion of the l = 0 term into the Hochschild complex. Take two objects\nXk (k = 0, 1) and idempotent endomorphisms [ak ] which define quasi-isomorphic direct summands. One then has cocycles b0 \u2208 hom 0A (X0 , X1 ), b1 \u2208 hom 0A (X1 , X0 ), and auxiliary cochains\nck \u2208 hom \u22121\nA (Xk , Xk ), such that\n(\n\u03bc2A (b1 , b0 ) + \u03bc1A (c0 ) = a0 ,\n(5.6)\n\u03bc2A (b0 , b1 ) + \u03bc1A (c1 ) = a1 .\nIn the Hochschild complex, this yields\n\u2202C\u2217 (A,A) (b1 \u2297 b0 + c0 \u2212 c1 ) = \u03bc1A (c0 ) \u2212 \u03bc1A (c1 ) \u2212 \u03bc2A (b0 , b1 ) + \u03bc2A (b1 , b0 ) = a0 \u2212 a1 ,\n\n(5.7)\n\nwhich shows that the Hochschild homology classes of the ak coincide. One can prove the general\ncase of Lemma 5.1 by a similarly explicit computation, but it is maybe better understood as\nfollows. As part of the general theory of derived invariance of Hochschild homology, we have\na chain map C\u2217 (Atw , Atw ) \u2192 C\u2217 (A, A) which is a quasi-inverse to the inclusion C\u2217 (A, A) \u2192\nC\u2217 (Atw , Atw ). From that viewpoint, (5.2) is the composition of that map with the inclusion\nhom Atw (C, C) \u2192 C\u2217 (Atw , Atw ). Then, applying (5.7) to Atw proves Lemma 5.1.\nRemark 5.2. One can approach (5.5) from a more abstract viewpoint. M gives rise to a class\nin K0 (Aperf ), and there is a Chern character type map (more appropriately called the Dennis\ntrace) from that to H\u2217 (Aperf , Aperf ). Finally, a stronger version of derived invariance shows\nthat H\u2217 (A, A) \u223c\n= H\u2217 (Aperf , Aperf ). We refer to [28] for an introduction to Chern characters\nin noncommutative geometry, to [18] for derived invariance, and to [48] for a more extensive\ndiscussion of the Hochschild classes associated to perfect modules.\n(5b) The Cardy condition. Let Q be a 2n-dimensional exact symplectic manifold which is\nconvex at infinity. This is a common setup (see [45, Section 3a], to pick one of many occurrences).\nIt means first of all that Q carries a one-form \u03b8Q such that \u03c9Q = d\u03b8Q is symplectic. Moreover, we\nhave a compatible almost complex structure JQ with the property that Q has an exhaustion by\nrelatively compact subsets whose closures are JQ -holomorphically convex. We will additionally\nassume that Q is symplectically Calabi-Yau, hence admits a JQ -complex volume form \u03b7Q . Objects\nof the Fukaya category Fuk (Q) are closed Lagrangian submanifolds L \u2282 Q which are exact with\n18\n\n\fL0\nL1\n\nL2\n\nL3\nFigure 1:\n\nrespect to \u03b8Q , and equipped with additional structures as before (a grading with respect to \u03b7Q ,\na Spin structure, and a flat complex vector bundle).\nThe Fukaya category comes with a canonical open-closed string map from its Hochschild homology\nto the homology of the symplectic manifold,\n\u2217+n\n\u03a6 : H\u2217 (Fuk (Q), Fuk (Q)) \u2212\u2192 Hcpt\n(Q; C) \u223c\n= Hn\u2212\u2217 (Q; C).\n\n(5.8)\n\nThe existence of this map, for the case of a closed symplectic manifold, was already implicit in\n[25]. Related ideas appear in various places in the Floer cohomology literature. We refer to [1,\nSection 5] for a more extensive discussion (which is more sophisticated than what we need here,\nsince it includes non-closed Lagrangian submanifolds and their wrapped Floer cohomology), and\nonly give a schematic description. Fix a Morse function (and Riemannian metric) which can be\nused to define a Morse complex C \u2217 (Q) underlying ordinary cohomology. Suppose that we are\ngiven objects (L0 , . . . , Ld ) (assumed to come with trivial flat bundles for simplicity), generators\nxi \u2208 CF \u2217 (Li\u22121 , Li ) (where we set L\u22121 = Ld ) which correspond to (perturbed) intersection\npoints, and a generator y \u2208 C \u2217 (Q) which corresponds to a critical point. One then gets a\nnumber nd+1 (y, x0 , . . . , xd ) \u2208 Z by counting (perturbed) pseudo-holomorphic maps which have\nasymptotics xi at the boundary marked points, and whose evaluation at the interior marked\npoint lies on the unstable manifold of y (Figure 1). These numbers form the coefficients of a map\n(not by itself a chain map)\nC \u2217 (Q) \u2297 CF \u2217 (Ld , L0 ) \u2297 CF \u2217 (Ld\u22121 , Ld ) \u2297 * * * \u2297 CF \u2217 (L0 , L1 ) \u2212\u2192 C[\u2212n \u2212 d].\n\n(5.9)\n\nThe collection of such maps for all d and (L0 , . . . , Ld ) forms the chain map underlying (5.8) (up\nto an obvious dualization).\nBy combining (5.8) with (5.2) for a twisted complex C, one obtains a map\n\u03a6C : H \u2217 (hom Fuk (Q)tw (C, C)) \u2212\u2192 Hn\u2212\u2217 (Q; C).\n\n(5.10)\n\nThe simplest example is when C is a single Lagrangian submanifold L equipped with a flat bundle\n19\n\n\f\u03c1, in which case (5.10) recovers the classical (purely topological) map\ntrace\n\nHF \u2217 (L, L) \u223c\n= H \u2217 (L; End (\u03c1)) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 H \u2217 (L; C) \u223c\n= Hn\u2212\u2217 (L; C) \u2212\u2192 Hn\u2212\u2217 (Q; C).\n\n(5.11)\n\nIn particular, the image of the identity [eL ] \u2208 HF 0 (L, L) is rank(\u03c1) times the usual homology class\n[L]. Similarly, given a twisted complex C, the image of [eC ] can be computed from the homology\nclasses of the Lagrangian submanifolds that enter into C. More generally, for any object M of\nFuk (Q)perf , one can take the image of (5.5) under (5.8), and thereby obtain a quasi-isomorphism\ninvariant, which we write as\n[M ] \u2208 Hn (Q; C).\n(5.12)\nThere is no a priori reason why (5.12) should be an integer class. However, one can obtain some\nrestrictions on it from the following:\nProposition 5.3. Suppose that we have two twisted complexes Ck (k = 0, 1), each of which\ncomes with an endomorphism [ak ] \u2208 H \u2217 (hom Fuk (Q)tw (Ck , Ck )). Then\n\u0001\n\u03a6C1 ([a1 ]) * \u03a6C0 ([a0 ]) = (\u22121)n(n+1)/2 Str [a] 7\u2212\u2192 (\u22121)|a|*|a1 | [a1 ] * [a] * [a0 ] \u2208 C.\n(5.13)\nOn the left side, we have the standard intersection pairing on homology. The right hand side is\nthe supertrace of the endomorphism of H \u2217 (hom Fuk (Q)tw (C0 , C1 )) given by composition with the\ntwo given [ak ], with the additional sign as indicated (note that either side can be nonzero only if\n|a0 | + |a1 | = 0).\nThis is a form of the Cardy condition, which a general feature of two-dimensional topological field\ntheories involving both open strings (Floer cohomology for Lagrangian submanifolds, in our case)\nand closed strings (the homology of Q). For an occurrence in another context see for instance [10,\nTheorem 15]. Suppose first that Ck = Lk are just Lagrangian submanifolds. In that situation,\nthe gluing and deformation argument underlying (5.13) becomes very simple; we summarize it\nin Figure 2. The general case is fundamentally parallel, except that the surfaces carry additional\nmarked boundary points where one inserts the boundary operators of the twisted complexes.\nWe do not carry out that general argument here; the intermediate level of generality, where one\nof the two objects involved is a Lagrangian submanifold and the other is a twisted complex, is\ndiscussed in detail in [1] (even though the intended application there is different).\nRemark 5.4. We will not attempt to justify the signs in (5.13), but if the reader wants to check\ntheir plausibility, the following considerations might be useful. Suppose as before that the Ck = Lk\nare Lagrangian submanifolds. If the [ak ] are identity elements, we recover (3.14). Next, if we\nswitch a0 and a1 (restricting to the nontrivial case |a0 | + |a1 | = 0), the left hand side changes by\n(\u22121)n+|a0 | . On the right hand side, for (a0 , a1 ) and (a1 , a0 ) we would be considering the sum of\nthe traces of the maps\nHF k (L0 , L1 ) \u2212\u2192 HF k (L0 , L1 ),\n\n[a] 7\u2212\u2192 (\u22121)k|a1 |+k [a1 ] * [a] * [a0 ],\n\nHF n\u2212k (L1 , L0 ) \u2212\u2192 HF n\u2212k (L1 , L0 ), [a0 ] 7\u2212\u2192 (\u22121)(n\u2212k)|a0 |+(n\u2212k) [a0 ] * [a0 ] * [a1 ].\n20\n\n(5.14)\n\n\fL0\n\nL1\n\n[a0 ]\n\n[a1 ]\ngluing\n\nL0\n\nL1\n\n[a0 ]\n\n[a1 ]\nL0\n\ndeformation\n\nL1\n[a0 ]\n\n[a1 ]\n\ngluing\nL0\n[a0 ]\nL0\n\nL1\n\nL1\n[a1 ]\nL1\n\nFigure 2:\n\n21\n\nL0\n\n\fUnder the \"Poincar\u00e9 duality\" in Lagrangian Floer cohomology, these maps are dual up to a factor\nof (\u22121)k|a1 |+k+(n\u2212k)|a0 |+(n\u2212k)+(n\u2212|a0 |)|a1 | = (\u22121)n+|a0 | .\nReturning to our discussion of (5.12), Proposition 5.3 implies that\n[M1 ] * [M0 ] = (\u22121)n(n+1)/2 \u03c7(H \u2217 (hom Fuk (Q)perf (M0 , M1 ))) \u2208 Z,\n\n(5.15)\n\nwhere \u03c7 is the Euler characteristic. In particular:\nCorollary 5.5. Suppose that Hn (Q; Z)/torsion is generated by homology classes of objects in\nthe Fukaya category. Let L0 be an object of Fuk (Q), carrying a flat vector bundle of rank r0 , and\nM1 an object of Fuk (Q)perf . Suppose that H \u2217 (hom Fuk (Q)perf (L0 , M1 )) has odd total dimension.\nThen r0 [L0 ] \u2208 Hn (Q; Z)/torsion is not divisible by 2 (and hence in particular nonzero).\nProof. Let V1 , . . . , Vm be a collection of objects in Fuk (Q) whose homology classes generate\nHn (Q; Z)/torsion. From (5.15) we know that [Vk ] * [M1 ] \u2208 Z for all k. Arguing by contradiction,\nsuppose that r0 [L0 ] is divisible by 2, hence can be written as r0 [L0 ] = d1 [V1 ] + * * * dr [Vr ], where\nthe di are even integers. Then r0 [L0 ] * [M1 ] = d1 [V1 ] * [M1 ] + * * * + dr [Vr ] * [M1 ] is also even,\ncontradicting (5.15).\n(5c) The (Am ) Milnor fibre revisited. We now return to our example of Q = Qnm , for some\nm \u2265 1 and n \u2265 2.\nLemma 5.6. For any object M of Fuk (Q)perf , [M ] \u2208 Hn (Q; C) is integral.\nSketch of proof. The simplest approach would be to enlarge Fuk (Q) by allowing some noncompact\nLagrangian submanifolds, and use an appropriate generalization of Proposition 5.3. Instead,\none can use the following technically less demanding workaround. Let Q\u0303 = Qnm+1 , with its\n(Am+1 )-configuration (\u1e7c1 , . . . , \u1e7cm+1 ). We know that there is a symplectic embedding Q \u2192 Q\u0303,\nwhich sends Vk to \u1e7ck for k \u2264 m. This induces a cohomologically full and faithful embedding\nFuk (Q) \u2192 Fuk (Q\u0303). The associated open-closed string maps fit into a commutative diagram\nH \u2217 (Fuk (Q), Fuk (Q))\n\n/ Hn\u2212\u2217 (Q; C)\n\n\u000f\nH \u2217 (Fuk (Q\u0303), Fuk (Q\u0303))\n\n\u000f\n/ Hn\u2212\u2217 (Q\u0303; C).\n\n(5.16)\n\nLet M be our object, and M\u0303 its image in Fuk (Q\u0303)perf . We then know that [M\u0303 ] is the image of\n[M ] under the map Hn (Q; C) \u2192 Hn (Q\u0303; C), which is just the inclusion Zm = Zm \u00d7 {0} ,\u2192 Zm+1 .\nMoreover, by Proposition 5.3, [M\u0303 ] * [\u1e7ck ] \u2208 Z for all k including k = m + 1. It is easy to see, by\ninspection of the intersection forms (1.2) and (1.3), that this implies the integrality of [M ].\n\n22\n\n\fThe following is a weak version of Lemma 4.1, whose proof is independent of the results of [16, 17]:\nLemma 5.7. Suppose that m is even. Let M0 be an object of Fuk (Q)perf whose cohomology level\nendomorphism ring is isomorphic to H \u2217 (S n ; C). Then H \u2217 (hom Fuk (Q)perf (Vk , M0 )) has odd total\ndimension for some k.\nSketch of proof. As in our original proof of Lemma 4.1, one can use general equivariance arguments to reduce the problem to the case n = 2, which we will exclusively consider from now on.\nFrom Lemma 5.6 we know that [M0 ] \u2208 H2 (Q; Z). Since M0 is spherical, Proposition 5.3 implies\nthat [M0 ] * [M0 ] = \u22122, hence [M0 ] is primitive and in particular nonzero mod 2. Since m is even,\nthe intersection form (1.2) has odd determinant, hence [M0 ] * [Vk ] is odd for some k. Applying\nProposition 5.3 again implies the desired result.\nThis directly leads to a weaker version of Theorem 1.1, which states that if L \u2282 Q is a rational\nhomology sphere and Spin, then [L] is not divisible by 2 (and therefore in particular nonzero).\nThere is also an analogous weak version of Theorem 1.5, which only excludes the existence of\nrepresentations \u03c1 satisfying (1.5) whose rank r is even. On the other hand, similar arguments\nyield the full strength of Theorems 1.2 and 1.4. For that, one replaces the given proof of Lemma\n4.3 by an argument based on Lemma 5.6 and Proposition 5.3.\n\n6\n\nMore algebraic background\n\n(6a) Group cohomology. We now start the more abstract discussion of equivariance issues.\nWe will only be considering the ground field C, and the multiplicative group G = Gm = C\u2217 .\nLet C[G] \u223c\n= C[z, z \u22121 ] be the ring of regular functions on G as an affine algebraic variety, with\nits usual (pointwise) multiplication. This also carries a coproduct, coming from the group structure on G. Rational representations of G are those which are direct sums of finite-dimensional\nrepresentations. They can also be identified with comodules over the coalgebra C[G] (respecting\nthe counit). While arbitrary direct sums of rational representations are rational, the same is not\ntrue for products.\nLet V be a rational representation of G. The bar resolution of V is a chain complex of rational\nG-modules concentrated in degrees \u2265 0,\nB r (G, V ) = C[G]\u2297r+1 \u2297 V,\n\n(6.1)\n\nwhere G acts only on the leftmost C[G] factor. To write down the differential, we prefer to\nthink of elements of (6.1) as maps b : Gr+1 \u2192 V . Explicitly, f1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 fr+1 \u2297 v corresponds to\n\n23\n\n\fb(gr+1 , . . . , g1 ) = f1 (g1 ) . . . fr+1 (gr+1 )v. In these terms,\nX\n(\u03b4B \u2217 (G,V ) b)(gr+1 , . . . , g1 ) =\n(\u22121)q b(gr+1 , . . . , gq+1 gq , . . . , g1 )\n(6.2)\n\nq\n\n+ (\u22121)\n\nr+1\n\ngr+1 b(gr , . . . , g1 ),\n\nwhich is equivariant for the G-action (g * b)(gr+1 , . . . , g1 ) = b(gr+1 , . . . , g1 g). One needs to check\nthat this preserves the subspace of functions of the form (6.1), and that is done by rewriting (6.2)\nin coalgebra terms (the same will be true in parallel situations later on).\nLemma 6.1. The comultiplication V \u2192 C[G] \u2297 V = B 0 (G, V ) induces an isomorphism V \u223c\n=\nH \u2217 (B(G, V )).\nSimilarly, the group cochain complex with coefficients in V is\nC r (G, V ) = C[G]\u2297r \u2297 V,\n(\u03b4C \u2217 (G,V ) c)(gr , . . . , g1 ) =\n\nX\n(\u22121)q c(gr , . . . , gq+1 gq , . . . , g1 )\n\n(6.3)\n\nq\n\n+ (\u22121)r gr c(gr\u22121 , . . . , g1 ) + c(gr , . . . , g2 ).\nLemma 6.2. The inclusion V G ,\u2192 V = C 0 (G, V ) induces an isomorphism V G \u223c\n= H \u2217 (C(G, V )).\n\nWhile Lemma 6.1 is a general fact about linear algebraic groups, Lemma 6.2 relies on the semisimplicity of G. Of course, both results are classical, see [14].\n(6b) Families of modules. We return to the discussion of A\u221e -structures from Section 2a, in\norder to mention a less familiar aspect, namely the theory of families of A\u221e -modules [44, Section\n1]. Let A be a strictly unital A\u221e -algebra. Take a smooth affine variety X, with coordinate ring\nC[X]. A family of A-modules over X is given by a graded C[X]-module N such that each N k is\nprojective, together with structure maps\n\u03bcd+1\n: N \u2297C A\u2297d \u2212\u2192 N [1 \u2212 d]\nN\n\n(6.4)\n\nwhich are C[X]-linear and satisfy the usual conditions. It may be useful to recall that over rings\nwith finite global dimension, such as C[X], unbounded complexes of projective modules are wellbehaved [11]. Families of modules over X form a dg category linear over C[X], which we denote\nby Amod /X.\nThe simplest example is the trivial (or constant) family associated to an A-module M , which is\nC[X] \u2297 M with the A\u221e -module structure of M extended C[X]-linearly. Take an A\u221e -module M\nand an arbitrary family of modules N . We then have\nhom Amod /X (C[X] \u2297 M, N ) \u223c\n= hom Amod (M, N ).\n24\n\n(6.5)\n\n\fOn the right hand side, we forget the C[X]-module structure of N (so this forgetting is adjoint\nto the operation of constructing a constant family). In the special case of two constant families,\nwe have a natural map\nC[X] \u2297 hom Amod (M0 , M1 ) \u2212\u2192 hom Amod /X (C[X] \u2297 M0 , C[X] \u2297 M1 ).\n\n(6.6)\n\nIf M0 is perfect, one can use (6.5) and (2.4) to conclude that this map is a quasi-isomorphism.\nReturning to the general situation, a family of A\u221e -modules is called perfect if, up to quasiisomorphism, it can be constructed from the trivial family C[X] \u2297 A by a finite sequence of the\nusual operations (shifts, mapping cones, and finally passing to a direct summand). In particular,\nif M is a perfect module then C[X] \u2297 M is a perfect family.\nLemma 6.3. Suppose that N0 is a perfect family, and that N1 is a family such that H \u2217 (N1 ) is\na finitely generated C[X]-module in each degree. Then H \u2217 (hom Amod /X (N0 , N1 )) is again finitely\ngenerated over C[X] in each degree.\nProof. This is a tautology if N0 = C[X] \u2297 A, and the general case follows from that by going\nthrough suitable long exact sequences.\nWe will also need to recall the definition of a connection on a family N [44, Section 1h]. We\nfirst introduce the more general notion of pre-connection. Such a pre-connection is a sequence of\nmaps\n\u2207\n/ d+1\n: N \u2297C A\u2297d \u2212\u2192 \u03a9X \u2297C[X] N [\u2212d],\n(6.7)\nN\nwhere \u03a9X is the module of K\u00e4hler differentials. The first term should be of the form \u2207\n/ 1N (n) =\n|n|\n(\u22121) DN n, where DN is an ordinary connection on the graded C[X]-module N . The higher\norder terms \u2207\n/ d+1\nN , d > 0, are C[X]-linear. The failure of this to be compatible with the A\u221e module structure is expressed by the deformation cocycle\ndef N = \u03bc1Amod /X (\u2207\n/ N ) \u2208 hom 1Amod /X (N, \u03a9X \u2297C[X] N ).\n\n(6.8)\n\nHere, we apply the usual formula for \u03bc1Amod /X , which is the differential on morphisms in the\ncategory of (families of) A\u221e -modules, to \u2207\n/ N , irrespectively of the fact that \u2207\n/ 1N is not C[X]linear. Explicitly, we follow the sign conventions in [42, Section 1j], so\ndef 1N (n) = (id \u03a9X \u2297 \u03bc1N )(DN n) \u2212 DN (\u03bc1N (n)),\ndef 2N (n, a) = (\u22121)|n|+|a|\u22121 (id \u03a9X \u2297 \u03bc1N )(\u2207\n/ 2N (n, a)) + (id \u03a9X \u2297 \u03bc2N )(DN n, a)\n\u2212 DN \u03bc2N (n, a) + (\u22121)|n| \u2207\n/ 2N (\u03bc1N (n), a) + (\u22121)|n|+|a|\u22121 \u2207\n/ 2N (n, \u03bc1A (a)),\n\n(6.9)\n\n...\nBecause of cancellation between the terms involving \u2207\n/ 1N , def dN is indeed C[X]-linear in n (recall\nthat a is an element of A, hence is constant over X). By construction, \u03bc1Amod /X (def N ) = 0, and\nthe class\nDef N = [def N ] \u2208 H 1 (hom Amod /X (N, \u03a9X \u2297C[X] N ))\n(6.10)\n25\n\n\fis independent of the choice of \u2207\n/ N . In particular, to compute that class one may choose a\npre-connection whose higher order terms vanish, in which case (6.8) simplifies to\nd+1\nd+1\ndef d+1\nN (n, ad , . . . , a1 ) = (id \u03a9X \u2297 \u03bcN )(DN n, ad , . . . , a1 ) \u2212 DN \u03bcN (n, ad , . . . , a1 ),\n\n(6.11)\n\nmeasuring the compatibility of DN with the A\u221e -module structure. A connection \u2207N is a preconnection such that def N = 0. Connections exist if and only if Def N = 0; and in that case, homotopy classes of connections are parametrized by H 0 (hom Amod /X (N, \u03a9X \u2297C[X] N )). If N0 and N1\nare families equipped with connections, then the graded C[X]-module H \u2217 (hom Amod /X (N0 , N1 ))\ncarries a connection in the ordinary sense of the word, denoted by DN0 ,N1 (see again [44, Section\n1h] for the definition). In particular, if this module is finitely generated (in some degree), it is\nnecessarily projective (in that degree) [5]. Moreover, these connections are compatible with the\ncategorical structure in the following sense: if the families Nk all carry connections, then\nDN0 ,N2 ([n2 ] [n1 ]) = DN1 ,N2 ([n2 ])[n1 ] + (id \u03a9X \u2297 [n2 ])DN0 ,N1 ([n1 ]),\nfor [nk ] \u2208 H \u2217 (hom Amod /X (Nk\u22121 , Nk )).\n\n7\n\n(6.12)\n\nWeakly equivariant modules\n\n(7a) Setup. From now on, suppose that our A\u221e -algebra A carries a rational action of G = C\u2217 .\nThis should be understood in a naive sense: we have a rational action of G on the underlying\ngraded vector space, such that all the \u03bcdA are equivariant.\nGiven an A\u221e -module M and some h \u2208 G, one can define the pullback module h\u2217 M , which has\nthe same underlying graded vector space as M , but with the twisted A\u221e -module structure\nd+1\n\u03bcd+1\nh\u2217 M (m, ad , . . . , a1 ) = \u03bcM (m, h(ad ), . . . , h(a1 )).\n\n(7.1)\n\nPullback by h is an automorphism of the category of A-modules, whose action on morphisms is\nh\u2217 : hom Amod (M0 , M1 ) \u2212\u2192 hom Amod (h\u2217 M0 , h\u2217 M1 ),\n(h\u2217 \u03c6)d+1 (m, ad , . . . , a1 ) = \u03c6d+1 (m, h(ad ), . . . , h(a1 )).\n\n(7.2)\n\nThere is also an infinitesimal version of pullback. Namely, define the Killing cocycle\nki M \u2208 hom 1Amod (M, g\u2217 \u2297 M ),\nX\nki d+1\nz \u2217 \u2297 \u03bcd+1\nM (m, ad , . . . , a1 ) = \u2212\nM (m, ad , . . . , z(ak ), . . . , a1 ).\n\n(7.3)\n\nk\n\nHere, g = C is the Lie algebra of G = C\u2217 . We picked a nonzero element z \u2208 g along with its dual\nz \u2217 \u2208 g\u2217 . The notation z(ak ) stands for the infinitesimal action of g on A. The cohomology class\nKi M = [ki M ] \u2208 H 1 (hom Amod (M, g\u2217 \u2297 M )) is a quasi-isomorphism invariant. As will be explained\nbelow, this is the infinitesimal obstruction to equivariance.\n26\n\n\fBecause of the structure of G as an algebraic group, it is often better to think in terms of families\nparametrized by G. The category Amod /G has a C[G]-linear automorphism \u03b3 \u2217 , which acts by g \u2217\non the fibre over g \u2208 G. We start with the trivial family C[G] \u2297 M , and define the orbit family\nto be N = \u03b3 \u2217 (C[G] \u2297 M ). The graded C[G]-module underlying N is still C[G] \u2297 M , but the\nA\u221e -module structure has been modified in such a way that the fibre of N over any point g is\ng \u2217 M . In the special case where M = A is the free module, one can use the G-action to trivialize\nthe associated orbit family, meaning that \u03b3 \u2217 (C[G] \u2297 A) \u223c\n= C[G] \u2297 A. From this it follows that,\nfor any perfect module M , the associated orbit family N is a perfect family.\nWe will now relate this construction to the previously introduced infinitesimal obstruction. By\ncombining (6.5) and the pullback \u03b3 \u2217 , we get an isomorphism of chain complexes\nhom Amod (M, C[G] \u2297 g\u2217 \u2297 M ) = hom Amod /G (C[G] \u2297 M, \u03a9G \u2297 M )\n\u03b3\u2217\n\n(7.4)\n\n\u2212\u2192 hom Amod /G (N, \u03a9G \u2297C[G] N ).\nA simple computation shows that the image of ki M \u2208 hom Amod (M, g\u2217 \u2297 M ) under (7.4) is the\ndeformation class associated to the trivial pre-connection \u2207\n/ N (the one obtained by identifying the\nunderlying C[G]-module with C[G]\u2297M ). Since the inclusion of constants, hom Amod (M, g\u2217 \u2297M ) ,\u2192\nhom Amod (M, C[G] \u2297 g\u2217 \u2297 M ), is injective on cohomology, N admits a connection if and only if\nKi M = 0. More concretely, a choice of coboundary \u03bc1Amod (\u03b1) = ki M yields a connection \u2207N on\nN , given by\n\u22071N (n)(g) = (\u22121)|n| dn(g) \u2212 \u03b11 (n(g)),\nd+1\n\u2207d+1\n(n(g), g(ad ), . . . , g(a1 ))\nN (n, ad , . . . , a1 )(g) = \u2212\u03b1\n\nfor d > 0.\n\n(7.5)\n\nHere, we think of n \u2208 N \u223c\n= C[G] \u2297 M as a function on G with values in M ; and of \u2207n \u2208\n\u03a9G \u2297C[G] N \u223c\n= \u03a9G \u2297 M \u223c\n= C[G] \u2297 g\u2217 \u2297 M as a function on G with values in g\u2217 \u2297 M .\nRemark 7.1. The orbit family has a symmetry property, which is intuitively obvious but whose\nformal statement requires a bit of effort. Let's temporarily suppose that N is an arbitrary family\nof A-modules over G. Given some fixed h \u2208 G, we can form h\u2217 N , which is the pullback (7.2)\napplied equally to all the fibres. On the other hand, we can use the right multiplication map\nrh\u22121 : G \u2192 G, rh\u22121 (g) = gh\u22121 , and push forward the family N in the geometric sense, forming\nrh\u22121 ,\u2217 N . The reader will have noticed the unhappy proximity in notation between these two\nquite different operations (h\u2217 changes the A\u221e -module structure, whereas rh\u22121 ,\u2217 changes the C[G]module structure). To clarify the situation, we write things down explicitly: the graded vector\nspace underlying h\u2217 N and rh\u22121 ,\u2217 N is equal to that of N , and the C[G]-module structure and\nA\u221e -module structure are given by\n(f *h\u2217 N n)(g) = f (g)n(g),\n\nd+1\n\u03bcd+1\nh\u2217 N (n, ad , . . . , a1 ) = \u03bcN (n, h(ad ), . . . , h(a1 )),\n\n(f *rh\u22121 ,\u2217 N n)(g) = f (gh\u22121 )n(g),\n\n\u03bcd+1\nr \u22121\nh\n\n,\u2217 N\n\n(n, ad , . . . , a1 ) = \u03bcd+1\nN (n, ad , . . . , a1 ).\n\n(7.6)\n\nIn the case of the orbit family, it follows that n(g) 7\u2192 n(gh) is an isomorphism (of C[G]-modules,\nand strictly compatible with the A\u221e -module structure) rh\u22121 ,\u2217 N \u2192 h\u2217 N . Note also that any\n27\n\n\fconnection on N induces ones on h\u2217 N and rh\u22121 ,\u2217 N , which are different in general. However, for\n(7.5) those two connections are related by the isomorphism which we have just introduced.\n(7b) Naive actions. The notion of action on a module directly corresponding to the one we've\nadopted for A\u221e -algebras is:\nDefinition 7.2. A naive G-action on an A-module M is a rational action of G on the underlying\ngraded vector space, such that all the \u03bcd+1\nare equivariant.\nM\nExample 7.3. Suppose that A comes from a graded algebra (only \u03bc2A is nonzero). Then, it\ncarries a G-action which has weight i precisely on the degree i part. Suppose that M carries a\nnaive G-action, and write M i,j for the part of M i+j on which the action has weight j. Then, the\nbigraded space M with its operations \u03bcd+1\nis precisely an object of the category Amod considered\nM\nin Section 2a.\nIf M carries a naive G-action, then Ki M is trivial, since the cocycle ki M is the coboundary of the\nlinear endomorphism m 7\u2192 (\u22121)|m| z \u2217 \u2297 z(m) (in the contrapositive, if Ki M is nonzero, not only\ndoes M not carry a naive G-action, but neither can any other quasi-isomorphic module). From\na more geometric viewpoint, a naive action gives rise to an isomorphism C[G] \u2297 M \u223c\n= N , which\ntakes m(g) to n = gm(g). The existence of such an isomorphism implies that the deformation\nclass of N must vanish, which as explained before is equivalent to the vanishing of Ki M .\nIn spite of the apparently obvious nature of the definition, there are some points of caution. For\ninstance, if M0 and M1 carry naive G-actions, the space hom Amod (M0 , M1 ) carries a G-action,\nbut that may not be rational in general (because the definition involves a direct product).\nLemma 7.4. Suppose that M0 and M1 carry naive G-actions, and that M0 is equivariantly\nperfect. This means that in the category of modules with naive G-actions (and equivariant maps),\nM0 is quasi-isomorphic to a direct summand of an object produced from A by the following\noperations: changing the group actions by tensoring with a character; shifting the grading; and\nmapping cones. Then hom Amod (M0 , M1 ) is G-equivariantly quasi-isomorphic to a chain complex\nof rational G-modules.\nProof. This is elementary if M0 can be constructed as an equivariant twisted complex, which\nmeans without taking a direct summand. The general case follows from the fact that the derived\ncategory of rational G-modules admits countable direct sums, hence is closed under homotopy\nretracts [32, Proposition 2.2].\n(7c) Strict actions. Instead of asking for G to act on M linearly, one can allow higher order\nterms. What one then wants is, for each g \u2208 G, a homomorphism\n\u03c11 (g) \u2208 hom 0Amod (M, g \u2217 M ).\n28\n\n(7.7)\n\n\fThere is a unitality condition, which says that this should be the identity if g = e. We also need\na cocycle condition which is formulated in terms of pullbacks, namely\n\u03bc2Amod (g1\u2217 \u03c11 (g2 ), \u03c11 (g1 )) = \u03c11 (g2 g1 ) \u2208 hom 0Amod (M, g1\u2217 g2\u2217 M ).\n\n(7.8)\n\nIt may be worth while to spell this out a little. The condition that \u03c11 (g) should be a module\nhomomorphism, meaning that \u03bc1Amod (\u03c11 (g)) = 0, yields an infinite sequence of equations\nX\n1,d+1\u2212i\n(\u22121)|ai+1 |+***+|ad |+|m|+d\u2212i \u03bci+1\n(g, m, ad , . . . , ai+1 ), g(ai ), . . . , g(a1 ))\nM (\u03c1\ni\n\n+\n\nX\n\n+\n\nX\n\n(\u22121)|ai+1 |+***+|ad |+|m|+d\u2212i \u03c11,i+1 (g, \u03bcd\u2212i+1\n(m, ad , . . . , ai+1 ), ai , . . . , a1 )\nM\n\n(7.9)\n\ni\n\n(\u22121)|ai+1 |+***+|ad |+|m|+d\u2212i \u03c11,d+2\u2212j (g, m, ad , . . . , ai+j+1 ,\n\ni,j\n\n\u03bcjA (ai+j , . . . , ai+1 ), ai , . . . , a1 ) = 0,\n\nof which the two simplest ones are\n\u03bc1M (\u03c11,1 (g, m)) + \u03c11,1 (g, \u03bc1M (m)) = 0,\n\n(7.10)\n\n\u03bc1M (\u03c11,2 (g, m, a)) + (\u22121)|a|\u22121 \u03c11,2 (g, \u03bc1M (m), a) + \u03c11,2 (g, m, \u03bc1A (a))\n+\n\n(\u22121)|a|\u22121 \u03bc2M (\u03c11,1 (g, m), g(a))\n\n+\u03c1\n\n1,1\n\n(g, \u03bc2M (m, a))\n\n(7.11)\n= 0.\n\n(7.10) implies that for each g, the map\nm 7\u2212\u2192 (\u22121)|m| \u03c11,1 (g, m)\n\n(7.12)\n\nis an endomorphism of M as a chain complex. (7.11) says that the map on cohomology induced\nby (7.12) is a homomorphism from the H(A)-module H(M ) to the pullback module g \u2217 H(M ).\nThe other requirement is (7.8), which yields\nX\n(\u22121)|ai+1 |+***+|ad |+|m|+d\u2212i \u03c11,i+1 (g2 , \u03c11,d+1\u2212i (g1 , m, ad , . . . , ai+1 ), g1 (ai ), . . . , g1 (a1 ))\n(7.13)\ni\n\u2212 \u03c11,d+1 (g2 g1 , m, ad , . . . , a1 ) = 0.\nThe simplest of these equations is\n(\u22121)|m| \u03c11,1 (g2 , \u03c11,1 (g1 , m)) \u2212 \u03c11,1 (g2 g1 , m) = 0,\n\n(7.14)\n\nwhich says that the maps (7.12) are strictly compatible with the group structure of G. On the\ncohomology level, the outcome is that H(M ) is an equivariant H(A)-module in the classical sense.\nSo far, we have treated G as a discrete group. To take its algebraic nature into account, we\nfurther impose a rationality condition, namely that the maps \u03c11,d+1 (g) for varying g should be\nspecializations of a single linear map\n\u03c11,d+1 : M \u2297 A\u2297d \u2212\u2192 C[G] \u2297 M [\u2212d].\n29\n\n(7.15)\n\n\fRationality becomes more natural from a geometric viewpoint. Spelling out (6.5) yields\nY\nhom Amod /G (C[G] \u2297 M, N ) \u223c\nHom C (M \u2297 A[1]\u2297d , C[G] \u2297 M ),\n=\n\n(7.16)\n\nd\n\nhence can think of (7.15) as a single element\n\u03c11 \u2208 hom Amod /G (C[G] \u2297 M, N ),\n\n(7.17)\n\nwhich then satisfies \u03bc1Amod /G (\u03c11 ) = 0.\nTo formulate the cocycle condition in a similar way, it is convenient to introduce some higherdimensional families related to N (even if that makes the notation somewhat more cumbersome).\nLet Gr be the product of r copies of G, so C[Gr ] = C[G]\u2297r . These products come with projection\nand multiplication maps\npj,i : Gr \u2212\u2192 Gr\u2212j+i ,\nr\n\nmj,i : G \u2212\u2192 G\n\nr\u2212j+i+1\n\npj,i (gr , . . . , g1 ) = (gr , . . . , gj+1 , gi\u22121 , . . . , g1 ),\n,\n\nmj,i (gr , . . . , g1 ) = (gr , . . . , gj gj\u22121 * * * gi+1 gi , gi\u22121 , . . . , g1 ).\n\n(7.18)\n\nLet N r be the pullback of the orbit family by the total multiplication map mr,1 : Gr \u2192 G (this\nincludes the case r = 1, where N 1 = N ; and the degenerate case r = 0, where N 0 = M considered\nas a family over a point). Equivalently, let \u03b3k\u2217 be the automorphism of Amod /Gr which acts by\ngk\u2217 on the fibre over (gr , . . . , g1 ). Then N r is the image of the trivial family p\u2217r,1 N 0 = C[Gr ] \u2297 M\nunder \u03b31\u2217 * * * \u03b3r\u2217 . Generalizing the r = 1 case from (7.16), one has an isomorphism of graded\nC[Gr ]-modules\nY\nHom C (M \u2297 A[1]\u2297d , C[G]\u2297r \u2297 M ),\n(7.19)\nhom Amod /Gr (p\u2217r,1 N 0 , N r ) \u223c\n=\nd\n\nand can then rewrite (7.8) as an equation lying in the r = 2 case of that space,\nm\u22172,1 \u03c11 = \u03bc2Amod /G2 (\u03b31\u2217 p\u22171,1 \u03c11 , p\u22172,2 \u03c11 ) \u2208 hom Amod /G2 (p\u22172,1 N 0 , N 2 ).\n\n(7.20)\n\nThe m\u2217 and p\u2217 are geometric pullbacks, which change the parameter space of a family (hence the\nunderlying graded vector space), while \u03b31\u2217 affects only the A\u221e -module structure. Let's summarize\nthe discussion so far:\nDefinition 7.5. A strict G-action on an A-module M is given by a family of maps \u03c11 (g) satisfying the appropriate unitality, cocycle and rationality conditions. Equivalently, it is given by a\nhomomorphism of families of modules \u03c11 as in (7.17), whose restriction to the fibre at e is the\nidentity map, and such that (7.20) holds.\nGiven a naive G-action on M , one can define a strict G-action by setting \u03c11,1 (g, m) = (\u22121)|m| gm\nand \u03c11,d+1 (g, m, ad , . . . , a1 ) = 0 for d > 0. In converse direction one has:\nLemma 7.6. A strict group action on M induces a naive group action on the quasi-isomorphic\nmodule M \u2297A A.\n30\n\n\fThis is quite straightforward to prove: the \u03c11 (g) and the G-action on A induce linear maps\ng \u2217 (M \u2297A A) \u2192 M \u2297A A, and these satisfy all the conditions for a naive group action. Unfortunately, the outcome of this discussion is that strict actions are not fundamentally more general\nthan naive actions. Indeed, we have mentioned them mainly because they represent a natural\nstepping-stone towards another notion, which we will introduce next.\n(7d) Weak actions. The previous discussion suggests another, more substantial, generalization\nof the notion of group action on an A\u221e -module, which is to require all the relevant conditions to\nhold only on the level of the cohomological category H 0 (Amod ). More precisely:\nDefinition 7.7. A weak G-action on M is given by a homomorphism (7.17) of families of A\u221e modules (assumed to be closed with respect to \u03bc1Amod /G as before), whose restriction to the fibre at\ne \u2208 G represents the identity in H 0 (hom Amod (M, M )), and such that the equality (7.20) holds in\nH 0 (hom Amod /G2 (p\u22172,1 N 0 , N 2 )).\n\u2217\n0\n2\nThis means that there is another map \u03c12 \u2208 hom \u22121\nAmod /G2 (p2,1 N , N ) such that\n\n\u03bc1Amod /G2 (\u03c12 ) + \u03bc2Amod /G2 (\u03b31\u2217 p\u22171,1 \u03c11 , p\u22172,2 \u03c11 ) \u2212 m\u22172,1 \u03c11 = 0.\n\n(7.21)\n\nWhen written out explicitly in terms of (7.19) for r = 2, the components of \u03c12 are maps\n\u03c12,d+1 : M \u2297 A\u2297d \u2212\u2192 C[G]\u22972 \u2297 M [\u2212d \u2212 1],\n\n(7.22)\n\nand (7.21) says that\nX\n2,d+1\u2212i\n(\u22121)|ai+1 |+***+|ad |+|m|+d\u2212i \u03bci+1\n(g2 , g1 , m, ad , . . . , ai+1 ), g2 g1 (ai ), . . . , g2 g1 (a1 ))\nM (\u03c1\ni\n\n+\n\nX\n\n+\n\nX\n\n+\n\nX\n\n(\u22121)|ai+1 |+***+|ad |+|m|+d\u2212i \u03c12,i+1 (g2 , g1 , \u03bcd\u2212i+1\n(m, ad , . . . , ai+1 ), ai , . . . , a1 )\nM\n\ni\n\n(\u22121)|ai+1 |+***+|ad |+|m|+d\u2212i \u03c12,d+2\u2212j (g2 , g1 , m, ad , . . . , ai+j+1 , \u03bcjA (ai+j , . . . , ai+1 ), ai , . . . , a1 )\n\ni,j\n\n\u2212\u03c1\n\n(\u22121)|ai+1 |+***+|ad |+|m|+d\u2212i \u03c11,i+1 (g2 , \u03c11,d+1\u2212i (g1 , m, ad , . . . , ai+1 ), g1 (ai ), . . . , g1 (a1 ))\n\ni\n1,d+1\n\n(g2 g1 , m, ad , . . . , a1 ) = 0.\n(7.23)\n\nThe simplest of these equations is\n\u03bc1M (\u03c12,1 (g2 , g1 , m)) + \u03c12,1 (g2 , g1 , \u03bc1M (m))\n+ \u03c11,1 (g2 , \u03c11,1 (g1 , m)) \u2212 \u03c11,1 (g2 g1 , m) = 0.\nThis means that the chain maps (7.12) are compatible with the group structure of G only up to\nchain homotopies, which are given by \u03c12,1 . Of course, on the level of cohomology the outcome is\nstill that H(M ) is an equivariant H(A)-module in the standard sense.\n31\n\n\fWe need to further discuss the implications of having a weak G-action, since these are maybe\nnot as obvious as for the previously discussed notions of group action. Specializing to the fibre\nover g \u2208 G yields \u03c11 (g) \u2208 hom 0Amod (M, g \u2217 M ), and these satisfy the analogue of (7.8) on the\ncohomology level. In particular, each \u03c11 (g) is an isomorphism in the category H 0 (Amod ). As a\nconsequence, we get an induced G-action (in the ordinary sense of linear action) on the space\nH \u2217 (hom Amod (M, M )). This is defined by filling in the diagram (up to chain homotopy)\nhom Amod (M, M )\n\u000f\nhom Amod (M, M )\n\n\u03bc2Amod (\u03c11 (g),*)\n\n/ hom Amod (M, g \u2217 M )\nO\n\n(7.24)\n\n\u03bc2Amod (*,\u03c11 (g))\ng\u2217\n\n/ hom Amod (g \u2217 M, g \u2217 M ).\n\nWe can get slightly stronger versions of these statements by working uniformly over G, which\nmeans in terms of families.\nLemma 7.8. A weak G-action on M yields an isomorphism C[G] \u2297 M \u2192 N in the category\nH 0 (Amod /G).\nProof. Take (7.23) and pull the equality back via (id , i) : G \u2192 G2 , where i is the inverse map\ni(g) = g \u22121 . The result is\n\u03bc1Amod /G ((id , i)\u2217 \u03c12 ) + \u03bc2Amod /G (\u03b3 \u2217 i\u2217 \u03c11 , \u03c11 ) \u2212 id = 0 \u2208 hom Amod /G (C[G] \u2297 M, C[G] \u2297 M ). (7.25)\nIt follows that \u03c11 has a left inverse in H 0 (Amod /G). Since i\u2217 and \u03b3 \u2217 are isomorphisms, it has a\nright inverse as well.\nLemma 7.9. If M is a perfect module and carries a weak G-action, the induced G-action on the\ngraded space H \u2217 (hom Amod (M, M )) is rational.\nProof. We start with a version of (7.24) with variable g, namely\nhom Amod /G (C[G] \u2297 M, C[G] \u2297 M )\n\n\u03bc2Amod /G (\u03c11 ,*)\n\n/ hom Amod /G (C[G] \u2297 M, N )\nO\n\n(7.26)\n\n\u03bc2Amod /G (*,\u03c11 )\n\n\u000f\n\n\u03b3\n\nhom Amod /G (C[G] \u2297 M, C[G] \u2297 M )\n\n\u2217\n\n/ hom Amod /G (N, N ).\n\nLemma 7.8 shows that the composition with \u03c11 on on either side is a chain homotopy equivalence,\nand of course \u03b3 \u2217 is an isomorphism. If M is perfect, the cohomology groups in the left column\nof (7.26) are isomorphic to H(hom Amod (M, M )) \u2297 C[G]. By restricting to constants, we get a\nC-linear map\nH(hom Amod (M, M )) \u2212\u2192 H(hom Amod (M, M )) \u2297 C[G],\n(7.27)\nwhich is the C[G]-comodule structure corresponding to the desired rational representation.\n32\n\n\fLemma 7.8 again implies that if a module admits a weak action, then its Killing class must\nvanish. More interestingly, one can obtain a partial converse. Take an A-module M such that\nKi M = 0. Choose a bounding cochain \u03b1 for the underlying cocycle ki M , and associate to it a\nconnection \u2207N as in (7.5). Equip N 2 = m\u22172,1 N with the pullback connection m\u22172,1 \u2207N , and all\nthe constant families of modules with their trivial connections.\nLemma 7.10. Suppose that\n[\u03c11 ] \u2208 H 0 (hom Amod /G (C[G] \u2297 M, N )) = H 0 (hom Amod /G (p\u22171,1 N 0 , N 1 ))\n\n(7.28)\n\nis covariantly constant for the induced connection. Then, the class\n[m\u22172,1 \u03c11 \u2212 \u03bc2Amod /G2 (\u03b31\u2217 p\u22171,1 \u03c11 , p\u22172,2 \u03c11 )] \u2208 H 0 (hom Amod /G2 (p\u22172,1 N 0 , N 2 ))\n\n(7.29)\n\nhas the property that its restriction to each slice G \u00d7 {g1 } \u2282 G2 is covariantly constant.\nProof. By definition of the connections involved, m\u22172,1 \u03c11 is covariantly constant on the whole of\nG2 . Consider the other summand and restrict it to G \u00d7 {g1 }. The restriction can be written as\nthe composition of the following two terms:\n[g1\u2217 \u03c11 ] \u2208 H 0 (hom Amod /G (C[G] \u2297 g1\u2217 M, g1\u2217 N )),\n[id C[G] \u2297 \u03c11 (g1 )] \u2208 H 0 (hom Amod /G (C[G] \u2297 M, C[G] \u2297 g1\u2217 M )).\n\n(7.30)\n\nThe second of these terms is clearly covariantly constant (it is constant in the remaining variable\ng = g2 , and all the connections involved are trivial). The first is covariantly constant if we equip\nN 2 |G \u00d7 {g1 } \u223c\n= g1\u2217 N with the connection g1\u2217 \u2207N . That's not exactly how we described the process\n\u2013 we used the geometric pullback rg\u22171 \u2207N = rg\u22121 ,\u2217 \u2207N instead \u2013 but the result coincides with\n1\ng1\u2217 \u2207N , as discussed in Remark 7.1. We now know that both expressions (7.30) are covariantly\nconstant, hence so is their product by (6.12).\nLemma 7.11. Suppose that A is weakly proper, and that M is a perfect A-module. Take a [\u03c11 ]\nas in the previous Lemma, with the additional assumption that its value at g = e should be the\nidentity. Then [\u03c11 ] is automatically a weak action.\nProof. Weak properness implies that H(N r ) is a finitely generated C[Gr ]-module in each degree.\nThe constant family p\u2217r,1 N 0 is perfect, hence (by Lemma 6.3) H \u2217 (hom Amod /Gr (p\u2217r,1 N 0 , N r )) is\nagain finitely generated in each degree. Moreover, it admits a connection, hence is projective.\nWe want to show that (7.29) vanishes. It suffices to show that its restriction to each slice G\u00d7{g1 }\nis zero. We know that each such restriction is covariantly constant, and that its value at (e, g1 )\nis\n[\u03c11 (g1 ) \u2212 \u03bc2Amod (g1\u2217 \u03c11 (e), \u03c11 (g1 ))] = 0.\n(7.31)\nThese two facts together imply the necessary vanishing result.\n\n33\n\n\fHere is one concrete consequence of the discussion so far:\nLemma 7.12. Suppose that A is weakly proper, and that M is a perfect A-module which is rigid\nand simple, meaning that it satisfies the analogue of (1.6) in Amod . Then M can be equipped\nwith a weak G-action.\nProof. Ki M necessarily vanishes, which means that H 0 (hom Amod /G (C[G] \u2297 M, N )) carries a connection, hence is locally free of rank 1. It is therefore necessarily free as a C[G]-module. When\nchoosing a coboundary \u03b1 for ki M , we have the freedom of adding any scalar multiple of id M to it,\nand that changes the induced connection on H 0 (hom Amod /G (C[G] \u2297 M, N )) by the corresponding\nscalar factor. By adjusting that factor, one can achieve that the monodromy is trivial (here we\nuse the surjectivity of the exponential map, hence the fact that our ground field is C), and then\nthere is a covariantly constant section as required by Lemma 7.11.\n\n8\n\nHomotopy actions\n\n(8a) Definition. Starting from the notion of weak action, one is naturally led to introduce\nhigher homotopies following the familiar simplicial pattern. We will now explain the resulting\nnotion. As before, A is an A\u221e -algebra carrying a rational action of G = C\u2217 .\nLet M be an A-module. A homotopy action of G on M is given by maps\n\u03c1r,d+1 (gr , . . . , g1 ) : M \u2297 A\u2297d \u2212\u2192 M [1 \u2212 d \u2212 r]\n\n(8.1)\n\nfor r \u2265 1, gr , . . . , g1 \u2208 G, and d \u2265 0, which satisfy conditions which we will now gradually\nintroduce.

For each (gr , . . . , g1 ), one can\n\n34\n\n\fconsider the collection {\u03c1r,d+1 (gr , . . . , g1 , . . . )}d\u22650 as an element\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u03c1r (gr , . . . , g1 ) \u2208 hom 1\u2212r\nAmod (M, g1 . . . gr M ),\n\n(8.3)\n\nand then (8.2) can be rewritten in the same way as in (7.8):\n\u03bc1Amod (\u03c1r (gr , . . . , g1 ))\nX\n+\n\u03bc2Amod (g1\u2217 . . . gq\u2217 \u03c1r\u2212q (gr , . . . , gq+1 ), \u03c1q (gq , . . . , g1 ))\nq\n\n(8.4)\n\nX\n+\n(\u22121)q \u03c1r\u22121 (gr , . . . , gq+1 gq , . . . , g1 ) = 0.\nq\n\nThe unitality condition is the same as for weak actions, saying that [\u03c11 (e)] is the identity in\nH 0 (Amod ). The rationality condition says that if we fix d, the \u03c1r,d+1 (gr , . . . , g1 , . . . ) for different\n(gr , . . . , g1 ) should be specializations of a single map\n\u03c1r,d+1 : M \u2297 A\u2297d \u2212\u2192 C[Gr ] \u2297 M [1 \u2212 d \u2212 r].\n\n(8.5)\n\nUsing (7.19) this can be thought of as a morphism in the A\u221e -category Amod /Gr ,\n\u2217\n0\nr\n\u03c1r \u2208 hom 1\u2212r\nAmod /Gr (pr,1 N , N ),\n\n(8.6)\n\nand then (8.4) can be written in analogy to (7.21) as\nX\nX\n\u03bc1Amod /Gr (\u03c1r ) +\n\u03bc2Amod /Gr (\u03b31\u2217 . . . \u03b3q\u2217 p\u2217q,1 \u03c1r\u2212q , p\u2217r,q+1 \u03c1q ) +\n(\u22121)q m\u2217q+1,q \u03c1r\u22121 = 0.\nq\n\n(8.7)\n\nq\n\nWe summarize the discussion:\nDefinition 8.1. A homotopy action of G on M is a collection of maps (8.5) satisfying the\nunitality and cocycle conditions.\n(8b) Turning homotopy actions into naive ones. Given a homotopy G-action on M , we\ncan construct another A\u221e -module M naive whose underlying graded vector space is\nY\nM naive =\nC[G]\u2297r+1 \u2297 M [\u2212r].\n(8.8)\nr\u22650\n\nIf we think of elements as collections of maps \u03b2 r+1 : Gr+1 \u2192 M , then the differential is defined\nto be\n\u03bc1M naive (\u03b2)r+1 (gr+1 , . . . , g1 ) = \u03bc1M (\u03b2 r+1 (gr+1 , . . . , g1 ))\nX\n+\n\u03c1r+1\u2212q,1 (gr+1 , . . . , gq+1 , \u03b2 q (gq , . . . , g1 ))\n(8.9)\nq\nX\n+\n(\u22121)q+|\u03b2| \u03b2 r (gr+1 , . . . , gq+1 gq , . . . , g1 ),\nq\n\n35\n\n\fand the other A\u221e -module structures as\nr+1\n\u03bcd+1\n(gr+1 , . . . , g1 ) =\nM naive (\u03b2, ad , . . . , a1 )\nr+1\n= \u03bcd+1\n(gr+1 , . . . , g1 ), gr+1 . . . g1 (ad ), . . . , gr+1 . . . g1 (a1 ))\nM (\u03b2\nX\nr+1\u2212q,d\n+\n\u03c1\n(gr+1 , . . . , gq+1 , \u03b2 q (gq , . . . , g1 ), gq * * * g1 (ad ), . . . , gq * * * g1 (a1 )).\n\n(8.10)\n\nq\n\nTake the (complete decreasing) filtration of M naive by r. The associated spectral sequence has\nE1r\u2217 = C[G]\u2297r+1 \u2297 H(M ). The next differential takes a given representative [\u03b2 r ] to\n(gr+1 , . . . , g1 ) 7\u2212\u2192(\u22121)|\u03b2(gr ,...,g1 )|+r\u22121 \u03c11,1 (gr+1 , \u03b2 r (gr , . . . , g1 ))\nX\n+\n(\u22121)q \u03b2 r (gr , . . . , gq+1 gq , . . . , g1 ),\n\n(8.11)\n\nq\n\nhence is precisely the differential (6.2) for the G-action on H(M ) induced by \u03c11,1 . It follows\nthat the only nonvanishing term on the next page is E20\u2217 \u223c\n= H(M ). In fact, by applying Lemma\n6.1 and a spectral sequence comparison theorem, one sees that the module homomorphism \u03c6 \u2208\nhom Amod (M, M naive ) given by\n\u03c6d+1 (m, ad , . . . , a1 )(gr+1 , . . . , g1 ) = \u03c1r+1,d+1 (gr+1 , . . . , g1 , m, ad , . . . , a1 )\n\n(8.12)\n\nis a quasi-isomorphism. One also has a quasi-isomorphism in inverse direction, which is linear,\nand takes \u03b2 to m = \u03b2 1 (e).\nM naive carries a G-action on the underlying graded vector space, mapping \u03b2(gr+1 , . . . , g1 ) to\n\u03b2(gr+1 , . . . , g1 g), which is compatible with all the A\u221e -operations. Because of the direct product\nin (8.8), this is not in general a rational representation. However, if M is bounded below as a\ngraded vector space, then each graded piece of M naive is a finite product, hence the problem does\nnot arise:\nLemma 8.2. Suppose that M is bounded below. Then, if it carries a homotopy G-action, there\nis a quasi-isomorphic module which carries a naive G-action.\n(8c) Obstruction theory. We will now consider the issue of extending a weak action to a\nhomotopy action. Fix some M and some s \u2265 3. Suppose that we are given maps \u03c1r for all\nr < s, satisfying the unitality condition as well as those equations (8.7) in which no higher order\nmaps appear. Temporarily set \u03c1s = 0. Then, the failure of the order s equation (8.7) to hold is\nmeasured by a collection of maps\nX\n\u000fs (gs , . . . , g1 ) =\n\u03bc2Amod (g1\u2217 . . . gq\u2217 \u03c1r\u2212q (gr , . . . , gq+1 ), \u03c1q (gq , . . . , g1 )))\nq\n\n+\n\nX\n\n\u2217\n\u2217\n(\u22121)q \u03c1r\u22121 (gr , . . . , gq+1 gq , . . . , g1 ) \u2208 hom 2\u2212s\nAmod (M, g1 . . . gs M ).\n\nq\n\n36\n\n(8.13)\n\n\fA straightforward computation starting with (8.7) shows that these are \u03bc1Amod -closed, hence\nactual module homomorphisms. Moreover,\n\u2212 \u03bc2Amod (g1\u2217 . . . gs\u2217 \u03c11 (gs+1 ), \u000fs (gs , . . . , g1 )) + \u03bc2Amod (g1\u2217 \u000fs (gs+1 , . . . , g2 ), \u03c11 (g1 ))\nX\n+\n(\u22121)q \u000fs (gs+1 , . . . , gq+1 gq , . . . , g1 ) = \u03bc1Amod (something).\n\n(8.14)\n\nq\n\nEquivalently, one can consider the class\nE s (gs , . . . , g1 ) = (g1\u22121 * * * gs\u22121 )\u2217 ([\u000fs (gs , . . . , g1 ))] * [\u03c11 (gs . . . g1 )]\u22121 \u2208 H 2\u2212s (hom Amod (M, M )).\n(8.15)\nTaking into account the sign changes (2.1) when passing to the cohomological category, composition with [\u03c11 (gs+1 . . . g1 )]\u22121 and pullback turns (8.14) into\n\u2217\n(\u22121)s+1 gs+1\n([\u03c11 (gs+1 )]E s (gs , . . . , g1 )[\u03c11 (gs+1 )]\u22121 ) + E s (gs+1 , . . . , g2 )\nX\n+\n(\u22121)q E s (gs+1 , . . . , gq+1 gq , . . . , g1 ) = 0.\n\n(8.16)\n\nq\n\nThe first term (modulo sign) is the action of gs+1 on E s (gs , . . . , g1 ) \u2208 H 2\u2212s (hom Amod (M, M )) as\ndefined in (7.24). Considering that cohomology group as a G-module, we may write (8.16) as a\ngroup cocycle equation\n\u03b4C \u2217 (G,H 2\u2212s (hom Amod (M,M ))) (E s ) = 0.\n(8.17)\nTo make this argument precise, we need to work with varying elements of G, which means that\nwe consider the error term and its associated cohomology class as elements\n\u2217\n0\ns\n\u000fs \u2208 hom 2\u2212s\nAmod /Gs (ps,1 N , N ),\n\nE s \u2208 H 2\u2212s (hom Amod (M, M \u2297 C[Gs ])).\n\n(8.18)\n\nAssume at this point that M is perfect. Using (2.4) one can rewrite the second term above as\nE s \u2208 H 2\u2212s (hom Amod (M, M )) \u2297 C[G]\u2297s ,\n\n(8.19)\n\nwhich by (8.16) is a cocycle of degree s in the complex C \u2217 (G, H 2\u2212s (hom Amod (M, M ))). A computation similar to the previous ones (and whose details we therefore omit) shows that, by adding a\ncocycle in hom Amod /Gs\u22121 (p\u2217s\u22121,1 N 0 , N s\u22121 ) to \u03c1s\u22121 , one can change E s by an arbitrary coboundary,\nwithout affecting the validity of the equations (8.7) for r < s.\nWe know from Lemma 6.2 that the group cochain complex is acyclic in the relevant degree.\nThis means that by adjusting \u03c1s\u22121 , one can get E s to become zero, which means that \u000fs is\na coboundary. After that, one can choose a \u03c1s so that the order s equation (8.7) is satisfied.\nInduction then shows the following:\nLemma 8.3. Every weak G-action on a perfect M can be extended to a homotopy G-action.\nWe can now state and prove a slightly more general version of Theorem 1.10.\n37\n\n\fCorollary 8.4. Let A be an A\u221e -algebra with a rational G-action, such that H(A) is finitedimensional in each degree (weak properness) and bounded below. Let M be a perfect A\u221e -module\nover A satisfying the analogue of (1.6) in Amod . Then there is a quasi-isomorphic A\u221e -module\nwhich carries a naive G-action.\nProof. Using standard Perturbation Lemma arguments, we can replace A by a quasi-isomorphic\nA\u221e -algebra which is minimal (has vanishing differential). This works equivariantly with respect\nto G, so we will assume from now on that A itself is minimal. Similarly, we can replace M by\na quasi-isomorphic module which is minimal, and we will assume that this has been done as\nwell. Since M is perfect, it then follows that it must be finite-dimensional in each degree and\nbounded below. One uses Lemma 7.12 to equip M with a weak G-action; Lemma 8.3 to extend\nthat to a homotopy G-action; and finally Lemma 8.2 to convert that into a naive G-action on a\nquasi-isomorphic module.\n\nReferences\n[1] M.
