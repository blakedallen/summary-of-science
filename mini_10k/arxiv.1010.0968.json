At\nabout the same time Thouless2 and Chester3 both suggested the possibility of superflow in a solid by vacancies. In addition, Leggett4 pointed out the possibility\nof Non-Classical Rotational Inertia (NCRI) associated\nwith quantum-mechanical flow via a superfluid velocity\n(a phase gradient) opposite the local velocity of the rotating lattice.\nSince the observation of NCRI by Kim and Chan,5,6 a\nnumber of laboratories have reproduced their work.7\u201314\n(For reviews that emphasize experiment, see Refs. 15 and\n16.) Were NCRI the sole criterion for superflow of solids,\nthere would be strong reason to accept that such superflow has been observed. However, a supersolid should\nalso have other properties, including a fourth sound-like\nmode, as predicted by Andreev and Lifshitz, and modified elastic waves with higher velocities, since the superfluid mass does not participate in the motion. (We remind the reader that a fourth sound mode in superfluid\n4\nHe occurs only when the normal fluid is entrained by a\nporous medium; in the present case the lattice serves as\nthe porous medium.) Neither a fourth sound mode nor\nvelocity shifts have been observed.17\u201319 However, a stiffened shear response is observed,20,21 although not enough\nto explain the observed NCRI.16 Note also recent work\nindicating that supersolidity in 4 He can only occur below\n55 mK.22\nAs a guide to experiments to observe the fourth sound\nmode,19 the present work calculates various quantities\nrelevant to its observation, such as the relative efficiencies of a transducer and a heater in producing both longitudinal elastic waves and fourth sound waves. It also\nconsiders the effect of a non-zero applied pressure Pa ; to\nsolidify 4 He, even near T = 0, requires Pa & 25 bar.\nTo our knowledge, previous works have not included the\neffect of Pa .\n\nAlthough we believe that vacancies are essential to\na microscopic understanding of superflow in solids, in\nthe hydrodynamic theory they play no fundamental role,\nother than as an additional variable largely tied to diffusion. Indeed, we believe that the hydrodynamic theory is\nmore likely to describe a supersolid related to the NCRI\neffect proposed by Leggett than to vacancy superflow.\nMost of the present work assumes that the system is\nisotropic. One effect this has is that the superfluid density, which properly is a second rank tensor \u03c1\u2194s , is propor\u2194\n\u2194\ntional to the unit matrix, so we take \u03c1s \u2248 1 \u03c1s .23,24 We\nthen write the superfluid fraction as\nfs =\n\n\u03c1s\n,\n\u03c1\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03c1s is the superfluid density and \u03c1 is the total (mass)\ndensity. fs is unity in a superfluid at low temperatures.\nHowever, in putative supersolid 4 He, the measured NCRI\nfraction, which if due to superflow should be equated to\nfs , is never greater than about 0.2. The effective normal fraction fn thus has the curious property of being\nnot less than 0.8, although at T = 0 there are no excitations to destroy the superflow. We have previously noted\nthis difficulty,25 and proposed that the lattice be given a\nmass fraction fL , in addition to a contribution fnex due\nto excitations, so that 1 = fs + fnex + fL . This permits,\nat T = 0, no excitations (so fnex = 0) but fs < 1. In\nthis viewpoint, the lattice velocity is identified with u\u0307i ,\nwhere ui is the lattice displacement, and the effective\nnormal fluid fraction fn is the sum of fL and a part fnex\ndue to excitations: fn = fnex + fL .\nIt is known that the more annealed (and thus more\ncrystalline) the sample of 4 He, the smaller the NCRI\nfraction.11 Likewise it is known that the more quenched\nthe sample, the larger the NCRI fraction.12 Hence the\nsupersolidity is more likely to occur for less crystalline\nsamples, which might be either glassy26 or consist of a\nlarge number of small crystallites.27 In both of these cases\nan acoustic probe is likely to take a rotational average,\nthus making the system behave more like an isotropic system than a crystal. Therefore we consider systems whose\n\n\f2\nmacroscopic properties are isotropic. If a pure crystal of\nhcp 4 He were to be supersolid, then the results we obtain\nwill be only an approximation; nevertheless they will be\na useful guide for experiment.\nWe also note that we are working in the linear regime,\nwhere the disturbances produced by a heater or transducer are expected to be only a small perturbation, as\nis assumed in all theories of this sort. It is possible that\nsolid 4 He is ultrasensitive to temperature or to stress (e.g.\nif it is a glass, perhaps the atoms can be driven off their\nsites by a transducer). Nevertheless, there should always\nbe a linear regime; Ref. 19 notes that their membrane for\nproducing putative fourth sound produced strains much\nbelow the critical value.\nThe present work is intended to be self-contained,\nalthough we do not derive the equations of motion,\nwhich may be most explicitly obtained from Sect.IV of\nRef. 28,29 nor do we derive the Pa dependence of various\nquantities, which is done explicitly in Ref. 30.\nSections II and III present the thermodynamics and\nequations of motion, respectively. Section IV studies the\neigenfrequency and eigenmodes for each of the longitudinal propagating modes. Section V finds, for each mode,\nthe stress and temperature response in terms of the normal fluid velocity. Section VI finds and discusses the efficiency of generating each propagating mode by a transducer and a heater. Section VII provides a brief summary\nof the results.\nOne of the features of the hydrodynamic theory of supersolids is that it contains stress due to both internal\npressure P and the lattice, in order to permit the system\nproperties to continuously transform into those of a superfluid. This means that under an applied pressure Pa\nthe pressure and the lattice each take up a part of it. We\nbelieve that use of both a pressure and a lattice stress is\nneeded not merely for solid 4 He but for other solids as\nwell, particularly those under pressure or with point defects that are not in equilibrium.30 Appendix A discusses\nthe relationship between the internal pressure P and the\napplied pressure Pa , which we estimate using experimental data and results from Ref. 30. Appendix B discusses\nthe relative sizes of velocities and strains in a crystal under an applied pressure. Appendix C finds the relative\nsize of two thermodynamic derivatives of temperature T\nthat appear in the generation efficiencies.\n\nII.\n\nTHERMODYNAMICS\n\nThe thermodynamic equations for a supersolid are\ngiven in terms of the energy density \u01eb, entropy density s,\nunsymmetrized strain wij = \u2202i uj , mass density \u03c1, superfluid velocity ~vs , and momentum density\n~g = \u03c1n~vn + \u03c1s~vs ,\n\n(2)\n\nand their thermodynamically conjugate quantities.1,28\nHere ~vn is the normal fluid velocity. Specifically,\nd\u01eb = T ds + \u03bbik dwik + \u03bcd\u03c1 + ~vn * d~g + ~js * d~vs ,\n\u01eb = \u2212P + T s + \u03bbik wik + \u03bc\u03c1 + ~vn * ~g + ~js * ~vs ,\n\n(3)\n(4)\n\n0 = \u2212dP + sdT + wik d\u03bbik + \u03c1d\u03bc + ~g * d~vn + ~vs * d~js .\n(5)\nHere the thermodynamically conjugate quantities are\ntemperature T , (unsymmetrized) elastic tensor density\n\u03bbik (with units of pressure P ), chemical potential \u03bc (with\nunits of velocity squared), normal fluid velocity ~vn , and\n~js = ~g \u2212 \u03c1~vn = \u03c1s (~vs \u2212 ~vn ).\n\n(6)\n\nNote that ~js has units of momentum density but is invariant under Galilean boosts. That is, if both ~vn and ~vs\nare boosted by \u03b4~v , ~js does not change.\nWe find it convenient to define\n~jn \u2261 \u03c1~vn ,\n\n(7)\n\n~g = ~jn + ~js .\n\n(8)\n\nso that\n\nUnlike ~js , the quantity ~jn is a momentum density both in\nunits and in its properties under Galilean boosts; under\na boost by \u03b4~v , both ~g and ~jn are boosted by \u03c1(\u03b4~v ).\nIII.\n\nHYDRODYNAMIC EQUATIONS\n\nEq. (3) shows that there are five independent thermodynamic variables. Two of them are scalars (s and \u03c1),\none is a tensor (wik = \u2202i uk ) and two are vectors (~g and\n~vs ). In developing the hydrodynamic equations we will\nemploy the first three, but we will use the two vectors ~jn\nand ~js in place of ~g and ~vs . For an ordinary solid, where\n~vs does not appear, it is convenient to use the variables\n\u03c3 \u2261 s/\u03c1, \u03c1, wik , and ~g, since \u03c3 decouples from the other\nvariables. Such decoupling does not occur for the supersolid. Note that one could also use the scalar variables T\nand \u03c1, or T and \u03bc, or s and \u03bc.\nUnless otherwise specified, thermodynamic derivatives\nwith respect to \u03c1, s, or wik are taken with the other two\nvariables held constant.\nWe consider small amplitude excitations of the form\nexp [i(~k * ~r \u2212 \u03c9t)], where the wavevector ~k is taken to\nbe known.

In what follows\nwe consider only an isotropic solid. The effect this constraint has on (20) and (22) is that the second-rank tensors are all proportional to the unit tensor, and the term\n\nkk kj \u03c1\u22121 (\u2202\u03c3ik /\u2202wjl ) in (20) contains two terms, one proportional to \u03b4il and one proportional to ki kl .\nTaking the dot product of these equations with ki then\ngives two equations in the unknowns \u03c9 2 , ~k * ~js\u2032 , and ~k * ~jn\u2032 .\nThis yields \u03c9 2 and the ratio ~k*~js\u2032 /~k*~jn\u2032 . In addition, taking\nthe cross-product of (22) with ki gives, since ~k \u00d7 ~vs = ~0,\nidentically zero. Further, taking the cross-product of (20)\nwith ki gives an equation having terms proportional to\n\u03c9 2 and k 2 , both multiplying ~k \u00d7 ~vn .\nThere are two ways to solve the resulting equations for\n~k *~j \u2032 , ~k *~j \u2032 , and ~k \u00d7~vn . One solution is to take ~k \u00d7~vn = ~0\ns\nn\n\u2032\n\u2032\n6= 0 (purely longitudinal modes),\nand kl jsl\n6= 0, kl jnl\nwith the frequencies determined by the two equations\nin the unknowns \u03c9 2 , ~k * ~js\u2032 , and ~k * ~jn\u2032 . Hence this set\nof modes is purely longitudinal. The other solution is to\ntake ~k \u00d7~vn 6= ~0 and ~k *~js\u2032 = 0, ~k *~jn\u2032 = 0 (purely transverse\nmodes), with the frequencies determined by the the crossproduct of (20) with ki . ~vs does not participate in the\ntransverse modes, so their mass weighting involves only\n\u03c1/\u03c1n , and their frequencies squared should be higher than\nin the normal solid by \u03c1/\u03c1n . To our knowledge such an\neffect has not been observed.33\nIV.\n\nLONGITUDINAL EIGENFREQUENCIES\nAND EIGENMODES\n\nRecall that, unless otherwise specified, thermodynamic\nderivatives with respect to \u03c1, s, or wik are taken with the\nother two variables held constant.\nA.\n\nSome Properties and Definitions\n\nWe now compute the quantity \u2202\u03c3ik /\u2202\u03c1, which appears\nin (20). We take the strain response of a solid to Pa to\n(0)\n(0)\nbe isotropic (i.e., wik \u223c \u03b4ik wll , where the superscript\n(0) denotes the static value). Recall that wik is unsymmetrized; here we take only the static part, due to Pa , to\nbe symmetric, as does Ref. 34.

(24) is also employed in Ref. 30, although there\n\u03c3 = s/\u03c1 is held constant rather than s. At T \u2248 0, the\ndifference should be negligible.

Note\nthat \u2202e\n\u03c3 /\u2202\u03c1 is not a true derivative, merely a definition;\nfurther, we do not here define a \u03c3\ne.\nWe now compute the quantity \u2202\u03c3ik /\u2202wjl , which also\nappears in (20). Since Ref. 30 shows that (\u2202P/\u2202wik ) \u223c\n(0)\n(0)\nwik \u223c wll \u03b4ik , we can write\n\u2202P\n\u2202P\n\u2261\n\u03b4ik .\n\u2202wik\n\u2202w\n\n(26)\n\n\u2202P/\u2202w is evaluated in Ref. 30, and is given in Appendix B.

Thus,\n(0)\n\n\u03bbll\n\n(A2)\n\nUnfortunately, K \u2217 is not a quantity measured experimentally, since the structure of the energy density dictates that the derivative is taken at constant strain (i.e.,\nconstant lattice site density).\nIn what follows, we roughly estimate \u2202K/\u2202V by assuming it to be of the same order of magnitude whether\ntaken at constant wik or under typical experimental conditions. That is, we take\n\u2202K\n\u2202V\n\n\u2248\nwik ,\u03c3,N\n\n\u2202K\n\u2202V\n\n\u2248\n\u03c3,N,exp\n\n\u2206K\n\u2206V\n\n.\n\n(A3)\n\n\u03c3,N,exp\n\nWe now consider the data of Ref. 35. Although the\nsamples were necessarily under pressure, Ref. 35 appears\nto apply c21 = (1/\u03c1)(\u2202\u03bb/\u2202w) = (1/\u03c1)[K + (4/3)\u03bcV ] without including corrections due to Pa .30 Nevertheless their\nresult should permit a rough estimate (for simplicity we\nconsider that T \u2248 0). We use K = (1/3)[c11 + 2c13 ],\nwhere c11 and c13 are elastic constants.35 . Select parts of\nTables I and II of Ref. 35 are reproduced in Table II for\ntwo molar volumes, which is sufficient to make estimates.\nThese data give \u2206V \u2248 \u22121.2 cm3 /mole and \u2206K \u2248\n160 bars, so that \u2206K/\u2206V \u2248 \u2212133 bars-mole/cm3, which\nwe take to be constant since the elastic constants in Figure I of Ref. 35 are linear in volume. Thus we obtain the\ntwo values for K \u2217 in Table II: K \u2217 \u2248 10K at Pa = 31 bars\nand K \u2217 \u2248 6.6K at Pa = 52 bars.\nFor Pa \u2248 31 bars, P/Pa \u2248 0.53 (and thus \u03bb11 /Pa \u2248\n0.47). For Pa \u2248 52 bars, P/Pa \u2248 0.37 (and thus\n\u03bb11 /Pa \u2248 0.63).\nFor V = 20.5 cm3 /mole, Pa /K \u2248 0.10, so it is appropriate to take Pa \u226a K. For V = 19.28 cm3 /mole,\nPa /K \u2248 0.11, and Pa \u226a K is still a reasonable approximation. Therefore, for applied pressures less than 100\nbars (and possibly higher), Pa \u226a K likely holds.\nPa /K increases as Pa increases. Therefore, although at\nhigher Pa we may find that Pa \u226b P (extrapolating from\nTable II), Pa /K might become on the order of unity,\nand the approximations made in the present work and in\nRef. 30 no longer apply.\nAppendix B: Velocities, Thermodynamic Derivatives\nand Strain in a Crystal Under Applied Pressure\n\nWe now estimate the relative sizes of the velocities c1 ,\nc0 , e\nc, and e\nc0 in the limit Pa \u226a K. We use the relationships between thermodynamic derivatives and applied\npressure given in Ref. 30.\n\n,\n\n\u2202P\n= \u2212Pa\n\u2202w\nc21 \u2248\n\n(B2)\n\n\u03c3,wik ,N\n\n\u2202P\nV 2 Pa2 \u2202 2 K\n=\n\u2202\u03c1\n2\u03c1K 2 \u2202V 2\n\n\u2217\n\n3K Pa2\n\u2212 3Pa .\n= 3P \u2212 3Pa \u2248\n2K 2\n\n(B1)\n\n,\n\u03c3,wik ,N\n\nV \u2202K\n1\u2212\nK \u2202V\n\n\u03c3,wik ,N\n\n(B3)\n!\n\n,\n\n(B4)\n\nK + 43 \u03bcV\n,\n\u03c1\n\n(B5)\n\nwhere \u03c3 = s/\u03c1. Here the internal pressure P has been\ntaken to depend only on the square of the strain. Although \u2202\u03bb/\u2202\u03c1 and \u2202P/\u2202\u03c1 in Ref. 30 are taken at constant \u03c3, not s, at solid 4 He temperatures we assume that\n\u03c3 \u2248 0 \u2248 s. Note that to lowest order in Pa /K, the strain\nof eq. (B1) agrees with Ref. 34, which includes lattice\nstress but no internal pressure P . (Ref. 30 also finds a\nPa2 term in the strain that is not obtained in Ref. 34.)\nWe now use the Gibbs-Duhem relation (5) to determine\nc20 :\nc20 = \u03c1\n\n\u2202\u03bc \u2202P\n(0) \u2202\u03bb\n\u2248\n\u2212 wll\n\u2202\u03c1 \u2202\u03c1\n\u2202\u03c1\n\"\n2\nV Pa V \u2202 2 K\n\u2248\n\u03c1K 2 2 \u2202V 2\n\n\u03c3,wik ,N\n\n\u2202K\n+\n\u2202V\n\n\u03c3,wik ,N\n\n#\n\n.\n\n(B6)\nNote that Ref. 1 takes \u03c1(\u2202\u03bc/\u2202\u03c1) = \u2202P/\u2202\u03c1, and thus does\nnot include the term proportional to the static strain. As\nfor P , \u03bc depends only on the square of the strain, via a\nMaxwell relation. This is not true for a good liquid.\nEq. (B6) shows that c20 is second order in Pa /K,\nwhereas (B2) shows that \u2202\u03bb/\u2202\u03c1 is first order in Pa /K.\nThus, for Pa \u226a K, |\u2202\u03bb/\u2202\u03c1| \u226b |c20 |.

K is a measure of\nthe stiffness of a solid. Thus, as V increases at constant\nparticle number and strain (or lattice site number density), i.e., as vacancies and lattice sites are added to the\nsystem, K should decrease, or \u2202K/\u2202V < 0. Then (B2)\ngives \u2202\u03bb/\u2202\u03c1 < 0, so that\n\nMoreover, since to first order c21 is independent of Pa ,\neqs.

Using data from Fig.13 of Ref. 37 we take an averaged\nlongitudinal sound velocity of 5 \u00d7 104 cm/s to be u,\nV to be 20 cm3 /mole, and (from Fig.13) \u2206u/\u2206V \u2248\n(\u2202u/\u2202V) to be \u22120.83 \u00d7 104 mole/(cm2 -s).
