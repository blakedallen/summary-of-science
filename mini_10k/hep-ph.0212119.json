The latter are very successful in describing accurately many\naspects of particle physics, but it is thought that ultimately, at some (very) high energy scale, a\nstring description is supposed to provide a fully consistent theoretical framework of high energy\nphysics. In the low energy limit, one would hope to recover the effective field theory description.\nHowever, the precise link between these two theories is not always clear. To clarify this relationship,\nphysicists try to reproduce previous string-derived results using effective field theory approaches.\nIt is the purpose of this work to address such a link for the problem of radiative corrections to\nthe gauge couplings in the context of an effective field theory model compactified on a two-torus.\nAlthough we seek to clarify the link with (heterotic) string theory, the calculation is also relevant in\nthe context of models with \"large\" extra-dimensions, without reference to string theory. The model\nis assumed to be a 4D N = 1 supersymmetric orbifold with an N = 2 sub-sector (e.g. Z4 orbifold)\nwhich \"survives\" after compactification. The two extra dimensions compactified on the two-torus\n\nhave associated Kaluza-Klein states \u2013 and at string level winding states as well \u2013 which fall into\nN = 2 multiplets, charged under the gauge group of the model. These states bring significant oneloop corrections to the gauge couplings. At (heterotic) string level, such corrections are well-known\n[1] (see also [2], [3], [4]), and will also be the subject of the discussion below.\nAn effective field theory (EFT) analysis of such one-loop corrections can only account for the\neffects of momentum states. Such analysis would correspond at string level to the limit of an infinite\nstring scale or \u03b1\u2032 \u2192 0 (with Ms2 \u221d 1/\u03b1\u2032 [5]), when winding modes' effects are suppressed. It was\n\nshown in [6] that such an EFT approach can recover the (gauge dependent part of the) string result\nfor the radiative corrections to the gauge couplings due to massive momentum and winding modes\nonly, in the limit \u03b1\u2032 \u2192 0 (and up to worldsheet instantons contribution, vanishing in this limit).\n\nThis is important for the EFT approach does not respect the full symmetries and spectrum of the\nstring. For further details on this EFT approach and model description see [6]. Here we continue\nthis EFT analysis, to reveal an additional, interesting effect.\nThe one-loop corrections to the gauge coupling \u03b1i in a N = 1 orbifold are usually separated as\n\nM2\nbi\nln 2s + \u03a9i ,\ni: gauge group index\n(1)\n4\u03c0\nQ\nQ is the low energy scale, Ms is the string/UV scale, \u03b1o is the \"bare\" coupling, the \"log\" term\n\u22121\n\u03b1\u22121\ni (Q) = \u03b1o (Ms ) +\n\nis due to N = 1 massless modes correction, usually identified with MSSM-like spectrum, with bi\n\none-loop beta function. \u03a9i is the (gauge dependent part of the) one-loop correction due to massive\nN = 2 multiplets/states (momentum and in string case winding states as well).\n1\n\n\fA (heterotic) string calculation [1] of \u03a9i gives\n\u03a9H\ni =\u2212\n\nh\ni\nbi\nln Creg.

T2 is expressed in \u03b1\u2032 units and describes the area of\n\ncompactification while U describes the shape of the torus (\u03b1\u2032 independent).\nThe EFT result for \u03a9i , of summing one-loop effects of massive Kaluza-Klein modes only [6] is\nT\n\u03a9EF\n=\u2212\ni\n\nh\ni\nbi\n\u2217\nln Creg.

If\n\none uses the same regularisation in both cases, the regularisation constants Creg. in (2) and (3) are\nequal, but unlike the string case, Creg. of (3) is due to an UV regularisation (not IR as in eq.(2)).\n\nIn the analysis below we address further subtleties of the gauge couplings corrections in this\ntwo-torus compactification. So far we mentioned the one-loop effects of the massive (momentum,\nand in string case also winding) modes on the gauge couplings. Orbifold models also have massless\nmodes, for example (but not only) the twisted modes \"living\" at the fixed points of the orbifold3 .\nConsidered separately, the massless states bring a logarithmic correction as in eq.(1), in addition to\nthe massive modes' correction. In this work we analyse more closely effects related to these states.\nTo compute the massless modes corrections to \u03b1i one needs an IR regularisation. An UV\nregularisation is also required for their logarithmic correction. Surprisingly, the IR regularisation\nmay have implications for the radiative effects of the massive Kaluza-Klein modes as well, in the\nEFT approach that we adopt in this work. Apparently it would seem that these two mass sectors\nare not connected. However, consistency of the regularisation requires us keep an IR regulator \u03c7\nin the massive sector as well (only UV divergent in the EFT case), and only in the end remove this\nregulator, \u03c7 \u2192 0. The result is the presence of an EFT correction to the gauge couplings which is\n\na \"mixing\" term \u03c7 ln \u03be with UV regulator \u03be \u2192 0 as well. This brings a \"non-decoupling\" of the IR\n2\n\nThis re-scaling by a constant (3/\u03c0) is ultimately [6] an effect of winding modes (modular invariance) and has no\n\nphysical meaning at EFT level; it only relates the EFT regulator to modular invariance \"regularisation\".\n3\nOther massless states exist, for example if Wilson lines are present. The effect discussed is not (necessarily) due\nto (massless) twisted states, but more generally to the existence of massless states in a infinite Kaluza-Klein tower.\n\n2\n\n\feffects from a UV logarithmically divergent correction. This correction must be added in the r.h.s.\nof eq.(1). This is a combined effect of the massless and massive sectors (via infrared effects).\nThis correction is not recovered from string calculations. In the one-loop string calculation of\n\u03a9H\ni\n\n(only) an IR regularisation is needed [1]. The aforementioned EFT correction can have a string\n\ncorrespondent of type \u01eb ln \u03b1\u2032 , with \u01eb \u2192 0 acting now as IR string regulator. As we will discuss, such\nterms do appear in string calculations. This term vanishes in the limit \u01eb \u2192 0 because \u03b1\u2032 is non-zero\n\nand the limit of removing the IR string regulator in such terms is then possible/allowed. If we\nthen take the field theory \"limit\" \u03b1\u2032 \u2192 0 on the string, terms like \u01eb ln \u03b1\u2032 are not encountered/kept.\n\nThus the limit \u03b1\u2032 \u2192 0 on the (regularised) string result will not recover the aforementioned EFT\ncorrection. This seems generic for the limit \u03b1\u2032 \u2192 0 of string calculations with infrared regularisation.\n\nString symmetries (e.g. modular invariance) ensure that calculations done in this framework\n\nshow a better (finite) UV behaviour than the EFT does, though the string does require IR regularisation. When \u03b1\u2032 \u2192 0 such symmetries do not necessarily survive, UV divergences (in \u03b1\u2032 ) appear,\nmay \"interfere\" with the IR regularisation and string symmetries (now broken) cannot teach us\nanymore in which order to remove the IR/UV regulators. If correct, the presence of the new EFT\ncorrection also tells us that one cannot address the UV behaviour (the \u03b1\u2032 \u2192 0 limit) of a string\nmodel without simultaneously addressing its IR behaviour and the limit \u03b1\u2032 \u2192 0 of the (regularised)\n\nstring may not always recover the UV behaviour as found in the corresponding EFT theory!\n\nIn the next section one-loop corrections are computed in the EFT approach with particular\nattention to the effect of massless states. The link with string theory and its \u03b1\u2032 \u2192 0 limit is then\n\ndiscussed, followed by conclusions. Some mathematical details are presented in the Appendix.\n\nOne-loop corrections to the gauge couplings.\nTo give quantitative support to our statements, we use the Coleman-Weinberg formula for one-loop\nradiative effects to the gauge couplings, see for example [5]. The one-loop corrected coupling is\n\u03b1\u22121\ni\n\none\u2212loop\n\n= \u03b1\u22121\ni\n\ntree\u2212level\n\n+ \u03a9Ti ,\n\ni : gauge group index\n\n(4)\n\nIn the context of two extra dimensions compactified on a two-torus the Coleman-Weinberg expression for \u03a9Ti due to summing the effects of all states in theory is\n\u03a9Ti =\n\nX Z \u221e dt \u2212\u03c0 tM 2\n2\n1 X\nm1 ,m2 /\u03bc\nTi (R)\ne\n4\u03c0 R\nt\nm \u2208Z 0\n1,2\n\n(5)\nreg.\n\n\u03bc is a finite, non-zero mass parameter introduced to set this equation dimensionless. Ti (R) is the\nbeta function contribution of a state - charged under the symmetry group of the model - and which\n3\n\n\fhas an associated Kaluza-Klein tower.

Except its \u03c7 additional dependence, \u03a9\u2217i is identical to that in\n(3) and in [6], where the effect of massive modes alone was analysed. Since \u03a9\u2217i is IR finite6 , it only\nneeds UV regularisation. However, we cannot remove its \u03c7 dependence i.e. set \u03c7 = 0 in \u03a9\u2217i of (11)\nbefore performing the integral.

Q is the lowest mass scale of the theory.\n\nEq.(18) shows an interesting result. The first term is just the massless modes logarithmic\n\ncontribution from the UV cut-off (\u039b) to the low energy scale (Q) where such states decouple. It\ncorresponds to the second term in the r.h.s. of (1). The second term in (18) is the contribution (IR\nfinite, UV regularised) of massive Kaluza-Klein modes alone mentioned in the introduction, eq.(2)\nin the string case and eq.(3) in the EFT approach (with Creg. = 4\u03c0 exp(\u2212\u03b3)). Its relationship to\nthe result of the heterotic string case [1] was extensively discussed in [6].\nThe last term in (18) is a new correction logarithmic in the UV scale \u039b and is not present in the\nlimit \u03b1\u2032 \u2192 0 of the string calculation eq.(2) or previous effective field theory calculations [6], [8]. It\n\nis due to the term \u03c0T2 \u03c7 ln \u03be of eq.(15) which is relating/mixing the IR and UV scales through their\nassociated regulators \u03c7 and \u03be respectively. This term arises from the sector of massive Kaluza-Klein\n\nmodes in the presence of the IR regulator \u03c7. The infrared dependent part of the massive (\"bulk\")\nmodes is controlling (part of) the UV behaviour of the gauge couplings. The effect is related to the\ninfinite number of momentum states that we summed over, see also its origin in the first integral in\n(B-4), and in (B-5), (B-8) of Appendix B. These equations also show the effect is present in models\n6\n\n\fwith two additional compact dimensions (more generally, for an even number of these). The effect\narises from Poisson re-summed (0,0) levels7 with respect to both dimensions compactified on the\ntwo-torus. These are the levels which also bring the leading power-like correction to the couplings.\nThe last term in (18) also shows that even though the massive Kaluza-Klein modes may have a\nlarge mass, of the order the compactification scale, they can still bring a contribution proportional\nto the (much) lower scale Q (where they are actually decoupled!). The logarithm can be large since\nU2 \u226a T2\u2217 (equivalently 1/R1 \u226a \u039b). However the coefficient in front is small Q2 R1 R2 sin \u03b8 \u226a 1 for\nour result to hold, see (20), and vanishes when the two cycles of the torus collapse onto each other\n\u03b8 \u226a 1, (one extra dimension case). The new correction implies the existence in some compactified\n\neffective field theories of a connection between the IR and UV sectors. This effect is due to the\npresence of the IR regulator (required by the massless sector) combined with the UV divergence\ndue to infinitely many massive states. It seems that the overall effect of the infinite Kaluza-Klein\ntower on the gauge couplings cannot be split into massive and massless contributions only, as done\nin eq.(1), and an additional term is present, the last term in eq.(18). This term is ultimately a\ncombined effect of these two mass sectors, through infrared effects.\nThere remains the difficult question of regularisation independence. The UV regularisation\nemployed here is supported by previous works [6] which match the string result [1] for the corrections\ndue to massive modes alone (no massless state present). The IR regularisation using exp(\u2212\u03c7t), \u03c7 \u2192 0\n\nis similar to the IR regularisation used in some string theory approaches [11]. The discussion in the\nnext section also gives support to the regularisation choice independence of the result obtained.\nThe new correction found may have interesting implications. At the phenomenological level\nan example would be its effects on the exact value of the unification scale in the class of models\naddressed here, and the matching of the MSSM unification scale vs. the heterotic string scale.\n\nThe limit \u03b1\u2032 \u2192 0 of the string.\nThe presence of the new correction found at the EFT level may have additional implications, in\nparticular on the link between this approach and string theory. At the (heterotic) string level the\nrole of the UV scale \u039b (or equivalently \u03be \u2192 0) is replaced by the string scale Ms or equivalently\n\n\u03b1\u2032 \u221d 1/Ms2 . In the limit \u03b1\u2032 \u2192 0 one would expect that the string result and the effective field theory\n\nresult (18) would match. This does actually happen for the effects of the massive modes alone, \u03a9H\ni\n\nT while ignoring the massless modes role in the theory, as discussed in the introduction,\nand \u03a9EF\ni\n\neqs.(1), (2), (3) and in reference [6].\n7\n\nNote that these levels are different from the \"original\" (0,0) Kaluza-Klein modes.\n\n7\n\n\fThe difference between the (limit \u03b1\u2032 \u2192 0 of the) string results and those of the EFT approach\n\nappears when considering the role of the massless states. At the EFT level they introduced the\nIR regulator whose presence in the massive sector brought in the last term in (18). This term is\nnot recovered from available string results in the limit \u03b1\u2032 \u2192 0, (see eq.(1) and (2)). To understand\n\nwhy this is so, it is important to mention that the string evaluation of the corrections to the gauge\ncouplings requires an infrared regularisation [1]. This is because the contribution of the degenerate\n\norbits of the modular group SL(2,Z) contributing to the gauge couplings (see Appendix of [1]) is\nIR divergent. In the dimensional regularisation version [9] of the (IR divergent) string calculation,\nthe total string correction to the \"bare\" gauge couplings8 is evaluated to (the beta functions are\nnot shown explicitly)\n\u03a9Tstring\n\n\u221d lim\n\nZ\n\n\u01eb\u21920 \u0393\n\n1\nd2 \u03c4\nH\n\u2032\n1+\u01eb Z \u221d \u01eb + \u03a9 + \u01eb ln(T2 /\u03b1 ) + O(\u01eb)\n\u03c42\n\n\u0015\n\n\u0014\n\n(21)\n\u01eb\u21920\n\n\u01eb is the infrared regulator in string case (\u01eb \u2192 0), Z the string partition function including the\nmassless (\"zero\") modes contribution, and with the \u03b1\u2032 dependence of T2 as defined in string case,\n\nshown explicitly. 1/\u01eb accounts for the massless modes infrared divergence, which is logarithmic in\nH\nscale, and included in eq.(1). Finally \u03a9H is just \u03a9H\ni /bi with \u03a9i given in eq.(2), and stands for the\n\nmassive modes contribution. Additional terms like \u01eb ln(T2 /\u03b1\u2032 ) with \u01eb \u2192 0 do appear in (21) during\nthe IR regularisation of the string (see details in Appendix A of [9]) and are similar in structure\nto \u03c7 ln \u03be of eq.(15) leading to the last term in (18). Other terms relevant for the field theory limit\n\u03b1\u2032 \u2192 0, may be present in eq.(21) e.g. \u01eb(T2 /\u03b1\u2032 ) or may have a more complicated structure like\n\n\u01eb \u00d7 g(T ) with g(T ) being some SL(2, Z)T invariant function and \u01eb \u2192 0.\n\nIn the limit of removing the IR string regulator \u01eb \u2192 0, the term \u01eb ln(T2 /\u03b1\u2032 ) of eq.(21) vanishes\n\nand is not present in the final string correction to the gauge couplings given by eqs.(1), (2). This is\ntrue only if \u03b1\u2032 is non-zero as assumed by string calculations. However, in the limit \u03b1\u2032 \u2192 0 supposed\n\nto give the field theory regime, such term can bring corrections to the gauge couplings9 as it was\n\nthe case in the EFT analysis, and should be added to the final result. Therefore the limits \u03b1\u2032 \u2192 0\n\nand \u01eb \u2192 0 do not commute (similar to the EFT case where \u03be \u2192 0 and \u03c7 \u2192 0 limits on \u03c7ln \u03be did not\n8\n\nIn this work we always refer to the gauge dependent part of the string correction to the gauge couplings. The\n\nuniversal part (gauge independent) is \"absorbed\" into the definition of the \"bare\" or string coupling \u03b1o of eq.(1) to\nensure this is invariant (as it should) under the symmetries of the string, SL(2, Z)T \u00d7 SL(2, Z)U \u00d7 Z2T \u2194U [10].\n9\nThere are other IR string regularisations, considered to be modular invariant [11] which introduce a mass gap\nparameter \u03bc2 /Ms2 \u226a 1 as IR regulator. The correspondent of this regulator in our EFT approach is \u03c7. In this IR\nstring regularisation it would be useful to know if a calculation of the massive modes effects gives [in addition to \u03a9H\ni\nof (2)], correction terms O(\u03bc2 /Ms2 ) of structure \u03bc2 /Ms2 (T2 /\u03b1\u2032 ) ln(T2 /\u03b1\u2032 ) \u221d \u03bc2 R1 R2 sin \u03b8 ln(T2 /\u03b1\u2032 ). Such O(\u03bc2 /Ms2 )\nterms were not computed in this regularisation scheme.\n\n8\n\n\fcommute). This also requires an analysis at the string level, to explain if any string symmetry can\nstill prescribe (upon compactification) the order to take such limits in eq.(21). In a sense this tells\nus that to understand the UV behaviour of an effective field theory model from the limit \u03b1\u2032 \u2192 0 of\n\nits string embedding, one may have to address the IR behaviour of the string!\n\nWe think that one can recover in the string case the additional correction found in the EFT\napproach, the last term in eq.(18), using the regularisation approach of [11]. At string level this\ncorrection may have a more general form, invariant under string symmetries left after compactification. The limit \u03b1\u2032 \u2192 0 on such additional string correction should recover the last term in eq.(18)\n\ncomputed in the EFT approach.\n\nThe above discussion explains why there is no string counterpart available for the last term in\n(18), even though terms of structure similar to it can arise in the string case. This supports our\nexpectation that the last term in (18) is not a result of the regularisation choice, but a generic\npresence in the EFT approach. This gives an example where one cannot recover from the \u03b1\u2032 \u2192 0\n\nlimit of available string results the UV behaviour as obtained on pure EFT grounds. The effect\n\nmay be associated with the non-renormalisability of the EFT approach and the infinite number of\nmomentum states. The extra term found in the EFT case raises questions on the exact matching\nprocedure of the \u03b1\u2032 \u2192 0 limit of some (infrared regularised) string calculations with effective field\ntheory results.\n\nConclusions\nThe effects of two extra dimensions compactified on a two-torus were studied in an effective field\ntheory approach by summing one-loop radiative corrections to the gauge couplings, due to massless\nand massive Kaluza-Klein modes. First, if one considered the one-loop correction to the gauge\ncouplings of the massive modes alone (i.e. if no massless states existed in the theory) one would\nonly need an UV regularisation. The result obtained would be equal to that of the heterotic string\nin the limit \u03b1\u2032 \u2192 0, as previous works showed. However when including in the field theory approach\n\nthe effects of the massless states of the theory an IR regularisation is required in addition to the\nUV regularisation. A consistent treatment of these regularisations brings an additional correction\nto the gauge couplings, which is logarithmic in the UV scale. This (one-loop) correction originates\nfrom a UV-IR mixing term \u03c7 ln \u03be (with \u03c7 \u2192 0, \u03be \u2192 0) between the UV and IR sectors through their\nassociated regulators \u03be and \u03c7 respectively. Consequently, one obtains the surprising result that\n\nthese sectors do not decouple from each other and this is due to the presence of infinitely many\nKaluza-Klein states. This also shows that the UV behaviour of the couplings is sensitive to IR\n9\n\n\fregulator effects associated with massive (\"bulk\") modes. The effect is present for two compact\ndimensions.\nRegarding the link with string theory, we discussed why the new field theory correction is not\nrecovered from known heterotic string results in the limit \u03b1\u2032 \u2192 0. While evaluating this limit, one\n\nshould note that string calculations for radiative corrections (to gauge couplings) usually require\nan IR regularisation. In the limit of removing the IR string regulator \u01eb \u2192 0, one discards those\n\n\u03b1\u2032 dependent terms which are multiplied by the regulator, for example \u01eb ln \u03b1\u2032 , (\u03b1\u2032 non-zero). Such\nterms are relevant for the gauge couplings, at least in the limit \u03b1\u2032 \u2192 0 of the string. This is because\n\nsuch \u03b1\u2032 dependent terms considered on their own, without the \u01eb dependence are divergent in the\nlimit \u03b1\u2032 \u2192 0 supposed to give the field theory regime. The discrepancy between the EFT and the\n\nlimit \u03b1\u2032 \u2192 0 of the string is ultimately due to the fact that the limits \u03b1\u2032 \u2192 0 and \u01eb \u2192 0 of the string\n\ndo not commute. This issue and its implications deserve further investigation.\n\nThe effective field theory result applies to models with \"large\" extra dimensions and is valid\nwithout reference to string theory. The additional radiative correction to the gauge couplings\nthat was found shows a connection via infrared regulator effects between the massless and massive\nsectors (of infinitely many states) of a compactified theory. The example discussed tells us that the\nlimit \u03b1\u2032 \u2192 0 on the results of the (IR regularised) string as well as its matching with corresponding\neffective field theory results is more subtle than initially thought, if massless states are present in\nthe theory.\n\nAcknowledgements:\nIt is a pleasure to thank H.P.

Thus no UV divergence (in \u03be) can appear and one can then set\n\u03be = 0. To evaluate the error introduced while doing so, see eq.(D-3). Note that J3\u2217 does not have\n\ndivergences in y \u2192 0 (we assume U2 6= 0), see eq.(14) of [6] where y = 0 case is evaluated; thus\nterms divergent in y e.g. \u03be/y or \u03be ln y are not present or \"missed\" when we set \u03be = 0).\nUsing the integral representation of Bessel functions, eq.(A-7) we find\nJ3\u2217 =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nm1 =1 m\u03032\n\n= \u22122 ln\n\n2 \u22122\u03c0m\u03032 (y+m2 U 2 )1/2 2\u03c0iU1 m\u03032 m1\n1 2\ne\ne\n+ c.c.\nm\u03032\n=1\n\nY\n\nm1 \u22651\n\n2\n\nThe product above may further be written as\nsociated series\nfind\n\nP\n\n2 1/2\n\n1 \u2212 e\u22122\u03c0(y+m1 U2 )\n\ne2\u03c0iU1 m1\n\n2\n\n(C-2)\n\n(1 + am1 ) and converges uniformly since the as-\n\nQ\n\n|am1 | converges uniformly.
