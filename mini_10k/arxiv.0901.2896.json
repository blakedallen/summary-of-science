According to the Standard Model,\nthere are three generations of such particles, each generation composed of eight objects: two leptons and two triplets of quarks. Interactions of these particles proceed\nthrough an exchange of various gauge bosons. The particles themselves (and systems composed thereof) differ in their properties, with the differences corresponding\nto different eigenvalues of various quantum numbers.\nTwo groups of such quantum numbers may be identified. The first one is composed of the so-called \"spatial\" quantum numbers, the other one comprises \"internal\" quantum numbers.\nThe spatial quantum numbers of a particle are those standardly written in the\nform \"J P C \". Here J denotes the spin of the particle, P denotes its parity, and C is\nthe so-called charge-conjugation parity. They are all connected with the properties\nof spacetime: spin is related to ordinary rotations, parity - to reflections in our 3D\nspace, while C-parity - being related to complex conjugation - is clearly connected\nwith time reflection. It is important to notice that all these spatial quantum numbers\nare nonrelativistic in origin. In particular, the emergence of antiparticles is not a\nrelativistic phenomenon as the Dirac equation might suggest: they appear also when\nthe strictly nonrelativistic Schr\u00f6dinger equation is linearized [2].\nAs far as internal quantum numbers are concerned, many physicists believe that\nthese quantum numbers should also be connected with some \"classical arena\" which\nwould constitute some kind of an extension of spacetime. In view of the nonrelativistic nature of all spatial quantum numbers it seems then natural to expect that the\nminimal extension of the concept of space needed for an understanding of internal\nquantum numbers should be nonrelativistic as well.\n\n2\n\nSpace, time and quantum\n\nIt might be argued that the reasoning of the preceding section, based on an expected\nanalogy between spatial and internal quantum numbers, is not sufficient to justify\nthe adoption of a nonrelativistic approach well enough. After all, the standard form\nof the theory of special relativity involves transformations which mix time with\nspace, thereby undermining the very concept of absolute simultaneity.\n\n1\n\n\fIn fact, however, the connection between space and time is more subtle than the\nstandard form of special relativity would suggest: the latter form emerges only when\nthe Einstein radiolocation prescription for the synchronization of distant clocks is\nadopted. Yet, distant clocks may be synchronised in various ways, reflecting the\npresence of gauge freedom related to the impossibility of measuring the one-way\nspeed of light. Absolute simultaneity may then be achieved with the help of a\nsuitable gauge [3].\nA different argument in favour of a nonrelativistic approach may also be given.\nNamely, although relativistic field theory does unite special relativity and quantum\nphysics, this marriage of quantum and relativistic ideas is in the opinion of many\nphysicists somewhat uneasy [4]. The actual wording takes various forms, such as\ne.g. \"The construction of a fully objective theory of state-vector reduction which is\nconsistent with the spirit of relativity is a profound challenge, since 'simultaneity'\nis a concept (...) foreign to relativity\"[5]. Considerations of this type lead to a\nwidely advocated idea that space and time are emergent phenomena, absent at the\nunderlying quantum level.\nWe conclude therefore that it is well justified to adopt an approach in which one\ndoes not start from mixing time with space. Yet, if the internal quantum numbers\nare to be connected with the properties of the macroscopic \"space\", the ordinary\n3D space clearly has to be somehow extended into a broader \"arena\".\n\n3\n3.1\n\nThe arena\nMax Born: a hint\n\nThe issue of a possible relation between some particle properties, such as mass,\nand the surrounding \"emergent\" space was of significant concern already to Max\nBorn, over half a century ago. In his 1949 paper [6] he writes: \"I think that the\nassumption of the observability of the 4-dimensional distance of two events inside\natomic dimensions (no clocks or measuring rods) is an extrapolation...\" He then\ncontinues with the discussion of a difference between the position and momentum\nspaces for elementary particles. First, he notes that the concept of mass appears in\nthe relation p2 = m2 , and that different observed elementary particles correspond to\ndifferent discrete values of m2 , thus rendering p2 observable. Then, he stresses that\nx2 , the corresponding invariant in coordinate space (with x2 of atomic dimensions),\nseems to be \"no observable at all\".\nAt the same time, he points out that the laws of nature such as\n\u2202H\n\u2202H\n, \u1e57k = \u2212\n,\n\u2202pk\n\u2202xk\n[xk , pl ] = ih\u0304\u03b4kl ,\nLkl = xk pl \u2212 xl pk\n\n\u1e8bk =\n\n2\n\n(1)\n\n\fare invariant under \"reciprocity\" transformations:\nxk \u2192 pk ,\n\npk \u2192 \u2212xk .\n\n(2)\n\nNoting that the reciprocity symmetry somehow does not apply to elementary particles, he concludes: \"This lack of symmetry seems to me very strange and rather\nimprobable\".\n\n3.2\n\nPhase space as the arena\n\nIn view of the preceding arguments and with quantum mechanics \"living in phase\nspace\", it seems natural to start from mixing the 3D space of positions with the\n3D space of momenta, and to look for any additional quantum numbers that might\npossibly emerge in such a broader scheme. In other words, instead of implicitly\nidentifying the ordinary 3D space of positions with the nonrelativistic arena on\nwhich physical processes take place, I propose that it is the nonrelativistic phase\nspace that might and should be viewed as such an arena.\nIt should be stressed that the procedure of mixing the spaces of positions and\nmomenta leads to such a generalization of the concept of ordinary space, which could\nbe termed \"minimal\". In particular no additional dimensions - \"hidden\" from our\nsight - are introduced in this way. We just have to recognize that this macroscopic\narena is around us, fully visible.\nIn the following, I will infer the existence of some internal quantum numbers from\nthe properties of this generalized arena. In a more fundamental approach, however,\none has to reverse the arrow of implications and - starting from the underlying\nquantum structure, as manifested in quantum numbers of elementary particles actually build the \"Emergent Phase Space\" (EPS).\n\n3.3\n\nPhase space and the Standard Model\n\nThe simplest phase-space generalization of the 3D concepts of reflection and rotation\nrequires a fully symmetric treatment of the two O(3) invariants, x2 and p2 , which\nis achieved by adding them together:\nx2 + p2\n\n(3)\n\nThis generalization leads to O(6), which goes beyond both Born's reciprocity and\nthe familiar symmetries of 3D space. Treating x2 and p2 as operators we now require\ntheir commutators to be form invariant. As is well known from the case of the 3D\nharmonic oscillator the original O(6) symmetry is then reduced to U(1) \u2297 SU(3).\nThe U(1) factor describes (in particular) Born's reciprocity transformations and\ntheir squares: 3D reflections. The SU(3) factor takes care of standard rotations\n(among other transformations).\n3\n\n\fThe appearance of the U(1) \u2297 SU(3) group from the first principles and the\npresence of the same group in the Standard Model (SM) raises the possibility that\nthe SM internal symmetry group is actually related to phase space symmetries. A\nconfirmation of this suggestion seems to require the construction of the SM gauge\nprescription from and/or upon the underlying quantum structure. The gauge structure would have to appear alongside the emerging (phase) space. Consequently, I\nthink it lies beyond our reach at the moment. In the following, I shall show, however, that the structure of quantum numbers obtained at the quantum level of the\nphase-space-related approach exactly parallels that observed in the real world.\n\n4\n\nLinearization of x2 + p2\n\nIn order to reach the quantum level, we linearize x2 + p2 \u00e0 la Dirac. Using anticommuting Ak and Bk (k = 1, 2, 3) , with explicite representation\nAk = \u03c3k \u2297 \u03c30 \u2297 \u03c31\nBk = \u03c30 \u2297 \u03c3k \u2297 \u03c32\nB7 = \u03c30 \u2297 \u03c30 \u2297 \u03c33\n\n(4)\n\n(B7 is the seventh anticommuting element of the relevant Clifford algebra), one finds\n2\n\n2\n\n(A * p + B * x)(A * p + B * x) = (p + x ) +\n\n3\nX\n\n\u03c3k \u2297 \u03c3k \u2297 \u03c33 .\n\n(5)\n\n1\n\nThe first term on the r.h.s., denoted below by R, appears here because all six\nelements Ak and Bl anticommute among themselves. The second term, denoted by\nR\u03c3 , is due to the fact that xk and pk do not commute. These two terms sum up to\na total Rtot = R + R\u03c3 .\nThe SU(4)/SO(6) generators are constructed as antisymmetric bilinears of Ak , Bl .\nIn particular, the generator of standard rotation has the explicit form\n1\nSk = (\u03c3k \u2297 \u03c30 + \u03c30 \u2297 \u03c3k ) \u2297 \u03c30\n(6)\n2\nand corresponds to simultaneous (same size and sense) rotations in momentum and\nposition subspaces.\n\n5\n5.1\n\nEigenvalues of Rtot\nGell-Mann-Nishijima relation\n\nWe now introduce operator Y , to be identified shortly with the (weak) hypercharge:\n3\n3\nX\n1X\n1\nYk .\n\u03c3k \u2297 \u03c3k \u2297 \u03c30 \u2261\nY \u2261 R\u03c3 B7 =\n3\n3 1\n1\n\n4\n\n(7)\n\n\fTable 1: Decomposition of eigenvalue of Y into eigenvalues of its components\ncolour\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nY\n\n\u22121 + 13 + 13 + 31\n\nY1\n\n\u2212 13 \u2212 31 + 13 + 31\n\nY2\n\n\u2212 13 + 31 \u2212 13 + 31\n\nY3\n\n\u2212 13 + 31 + 13 \u2212 31\n\nSince the \"partial hypercharges\" Yk commute among themselves, they may be simultaneously diagonalized. One then gets the pattern shown in Table 1 (as the\nmatrices are 8 \u00d7 8, this pattern is obtained twice).\nIn [7] a conjecture was put forward that the electric charge Q is just an appropriately normalized operator Rtot B7 , evaluated for the lowest level of R, i.e.:\nY\n1\nQ = (Rlowest + R\u03c3 )B7 = I3 +\n6\n2\n\n(8)\n\nwhere, with Rlowest = (p2 + x2 )lowest = 3, the eigenvalues of I3 = B7 /2 are \u00b11/2.\nThe above equation, derived here in a phase-space-related approach, is known as\nthe Gell-Mann-Nishijima relation (with I3 known as weak isospin), and constitutes\na law of nature. With the help of Table 1, it yields the charges of all eight leptons\nand quarks from a single SM generation.\n\n5.2\n\nHarari-Shupe rishons\n\nWith the growing number of fundamental fermions, the problem of understanding\nwhy they group into generations composed of eight particles was addressed by many\nphysicists. The most widely cited proposal (over 320 citations) is due to Haim\nHarari and Michael Shupe [8]. The Harari-Shupe model describes the structure of a\nsingle SM generation with the help of a composite model. It builds all eight fermions\nof a single generation from only two spin-1/2 \"preons\" V and T (or \"rishons\" as\nHarari dubbed them), of charges 0 and +1/3 respectively. This is shown in Table\n2, where total charges and hypercharges of particles are also listed. Note that\nrishons obey strange statistics, i.e. it is the states with ordered rishons (e.g. V T T ,\nT V T , and T T V ) which are to correspond to the three colours of SU(3) and which,\nconsequently, are deemed different.\nThe rishon model, though algebraically very economical, has several drawbacks,\nhowever. These include, among others: the issue of preon confinement at extremely\nsmall distance scales (when confronted with the uncertainty principle), the apparent\n\n5\n\n\fTable 2: Rishon structure of leptons and quarks with weak isospin I3 = +1/2\n\u03bde\n\nuR\n\nuG\n\nuB\n\ne+\n\nd \u0304R\n\nd \u0304G\n\nd \u0304B\n\nVVV\n\nV TT\n\nTV T\n\nTTV\n\nTTT\n\nTV V\n\nV TV\n\nVVT\n\nQ\n\n0\n\n+ 23\n+ 13\n\n+ 31\n\u2212 31\n\n+ 13\n\u2212 13\n\n+ 31\n\n\u22121\n\n+ 32\n+ 31\n\n+1\n\nY\n\n+ 23\n+ 13\n\n+1\n\n\u2212 13\n\nabsence of spin-3/2 fundamental particles, and the lack of explanation as to why\nthe ordering of three rishons is important and leads to SU(3).\n\n5.3\n\nPreonless resolution of problems\n\nA comparison of Tables 1, 2 (using Eq. (8)) shows that the phase-space approach\nreproduces the main structure of the Harari-Shupe model exactly. In fact, it does\nnot only that: it also solves the three problems of the rishon model.\nNamely, the phase-space approach explains the structure of charge eigenvalues\nwithout assuming any subparticle components of quarks and leptons. Therefore,\nthere is no problem of \"where are spin-3/2 fundamental fermions\", and there is no\nproblem with preon confinement. Furthermore, the strange statistics of rishons and\nits connection with SU(3) are naturally explained.\nOne can readily understand the meaning of the \"ordered rishon structure\" (such\nas V T T ) in phase-space terms. Thus, the position of rishon corresponds to one\nof three directions in our macroscopic 3D space: V T T corresponds therefore to the\npartial hypercharge eigenvalue of \u22121/3 in direction (x, px ) and to the same eigenvalue\nof +1/3 in both remaining directions, (y, py ) and (z, pz ). Now, any discussion of\nrotations requires three directions, not just one. Hence the concept of spin simply\ncannot be applied to a single rishon. This is in line with Heisenberg's opinion [9]\nconcerning the idea of dividing matter again and again: \"...the antinomy of the\nsmallest dimensions is solved in particle physics in a very subtle manner, of which\nneither Kant nor the ancient philosophers could have thought: The word 'dividing'\nloses its meaning\".\n\n6\n6.1\n\nTransformations in phase space\nGenuine SO(6) transformations\n\nIn order to see the relation between quarks and leptons consider [10, 11] a trans\u03c3\n\u03c3\nformation generated by F\u22122\n, one of six \"genuine\" SU(4)/SO(6) generators F\u00b1n\n\n6\n\n\f(n = 1, 2, 3):\n1\n(\u03c30 \u2297 \u03c3n \u2212 \u03c3n \u2297 \u03c30 ) \u03c33\n2\n1\n\u01ebnkl \u03c3k \u2297 \u03c3l \u2297 \u03c33 .\n=\n2\n\n\u03c3\nF\u2212n\n=\n\u03c3\nF+n\n\n.\n\n(9)\n(10)\n\n\u03c3\nUnder F\u22122\n-generated transformations one obtains:\n\nA\u2032k = A1 cos \u03c6 \u2212 A3 sin \u03c6\nA\u20322 = A2\nA\u20323 = A3 cos \u03c6 + A1 sin \u03c6\n\nB1\u2032 = B1 cos \u03c6 + B3 sin \u03c6\nB2\u2032 = B2\nB3\u2032 = B3 cos \u03c6 \u2212 B1 sin \u03c6\n\n(11)\n\ni.e. A and B rotate in opposite senses.

(17)\nare not rotationally invariant is in my opinion an asset of the approach. Namely,\nthe only condition that quarks must really fulfill is that it is the systems composed\nthereof (i.e. mesons, baryons) that must be covariant under rotations. Thus, my\nconjecture is that quarks must conspire (see example in the next section).\n\n7\n\nClifford algebra and mass\n\nThe U(1) \u2297 SU(3) structure of (a half of) the Clifford algebra of nonrelativistic\nphase space is shown in Table 3. Here the even elements (linear combinations of\nSU(4)/SO(6) generators and the unit element) with I3 = +1/2 (hence superscript\n'+') are given on the left, while the odd elements (linear combinations of products\nof an odd number of Am and Bn ) with left and right eigenvalues of I3l = +1/2 and\nI3r = \u22121/2 are shown on the right. In the columns marked Yl and Yr , the left and\nright eigenvalues of Y are given. A more detailed explanation of entries in this table\nmay be found in [12].\nThe algebraic counterpart of lepton mass should be odd (just like the odd Am\nis associated with pm ) and is identified with the only odd scalar element in Table\n3, i.e. with G0 . The F\u00b12 -generated transformation from the lepton to the quark\nsector changes G0 into G{22} , which is a member of the SU(3) sextet, and is not\nrotationally invariant. However, the sum of the three quark mass terms, i.e. G{kk} ,\nis rotationally invariant, just as the idea of quark conspiracy suggests.\n8\n\n\f3\n\n\u2663\u2663 \u2663\nP\n\u2663P\n\u2663\u2663

1: Four of the eight \"DICE1979\" corresponding to the Harari-Shupe model.\nAll dice are identical when their rotations are admitted. Each corner corresponds to\none particle of a single SM generation. Each face corresponds to a rishon. The three\ndice to the right (coloured quarks) show the leftmost die (lepton) rotated around\naxes 1, 2, 3 by \u03c0, so that different corners (as marked) present themselves to the\nreader.\n\n8\n\nSummary\n\nThe phase-space approach provides a possible theoretical explanation of the structure of a single generation of the Standard Model. The symmetry obtained involves\nU(1) \u2297 SU(3) and resembles the full U(1) \u2297 SU(3) \u2297 SU(2)L symmetry group of\nthe Standard Model quite closely (in fact the SU(2) partners of I3 = B7 /2, i.e.\nI1,2 = \u03c30 \u2297 \u03c30 \u2297 \u03c31,2 , automatically do not commute with the 3D reflections, thus\nsuggesting parity violation). We have derived the Gell-Mann-Nishijima relation and\nreproduced the structure of the Harari-Shupe model (visualized in Fig. 1), while\nevading its main problems related to the introduction of \"confined preons\". The\nexistence of eight particles in a single SM generation has been related to the 23 = 8\npossible sets of [xk , pk ] = \u00b1i commutation relations, with the \u00b1 sign adopted independently for each direction in our 3D space.\nThe proposed aproach obviously raises many questions. The phase-space-related\nmodification of the way in which the imaginary unit enters into our theories brings\nin the question of whether it is possible to extend the concept of the arena further,\nso that parity violation in weak interactions (together with the emergence of three\nquark-lepton generations and the related appearance of the CP -violating i) could\nbe described in a more realistic way. Then, there are other important questions such\nas the issue of the emergence of points, the construction of composite systems, etc.\nI hope to be able to address some of them in the future.\nThis work has been partially supported by the Polish Ministry of Science and\nHigher Education research project No N N202 248135.\n\n9\n\n\fReferences\n[1] R.
