Alice has a way of generating\nmarket predictions, which she wishes to demonstrate to Bob, in such a way that he can verify the accuracy of her\npredictions post hoc, but cannot possibly exploit them before the predicted events occur. Bob needs a guarantee that\nAlice's predictions were genuinely made at or before the point she claims they were, and were not retroactively altered\npost hoc. They can solve their dilemma with a suitably secure protocol for bit commitment.\nMuch attention has been devoted to the problem of bit commitment, which is a basic cryptographic task that is\nimportant per se, and has many applications to other more complex tasks. It also has intriguingly deep connections\nto fundamental physics, which have been uncovered in the search for bit commitment schemes whose security is\nguaranteed by the laws of physics alone (i.e. without any need for extra computational or technological assumptions).\nInitially, work in this area focussed entirely on protocols based on non-relativistic quantum mechanics. Bennett\nand Brassard invented the first quantum bit commitment protocol [1], which (as they noted) is secure against both\nparties given current technology, but insecure if Alice has a quantum memory. Later attempts at unconditionally\nsecure non-relativistic protocols (e.g. [2]) were ultimately shown to be futile by the celebrated results of Mayers [3\u20135]\nand of Lo and Chau [6, 7], later further elaborated [8, 9], which show that no unconditionally secure non-relativistic\nquantum bit commitment protocol exists.\nThis picture changes radically when we also exploit the signalling constraints implied by special relativity. The\npossibility of using relativistic signalling constraints for bit commitment was briefly discussed by Mayers [3], who\nsuggested that his version of the no-go theorem should also apply to relativistic protocols. One strategy for bit\ncommitment based on temporary relativistic signalling constraints was indeed shown to be insecure against quantum\nattacks [10]. The discovery [11, 12] that relativistic protocols can evade the Mayers and Lo-Chau no-go theorems\nthus came as a surprise. Encouragingly, such protocols are practical (although challenging) to implement with\nexisting technology: ref. [12] describes a relativistic bit commitment protocol in which the parties can maintain bit\ncommitments indefinitely, by exchanging classical information at a constant \u2013 and presently feasible \u2013 rate between\ntwo pairs of separated sites under their respective control. It is provably secure against all classical attacks and against\nMayers and Lo-Chau's quantum attacks, and is conjectured to be unconditionally secure. However, there is as yet no\ncomplete security proof against general attacks.\nHere we introduce a completely new technique for bit commitment, which relies essentially on the properties of\nquantum information in relativistic quantum theory \u2013 specifically, on the no-summoning theorem [13]. It is provably\nunconditionally secure. In its simplest form it requires only one quantum state transmission per commitment. It\nillustrates a new way of exploiting cryptographically the control over physical information that special relativity and\nquantum theory together allow. This seems likely to find many other applications (e.g. [14]).\n\n\f2\nOne interesting potential application of the present work is to high-frequency financial trading, in which light\nspeed signalling constraints are already a significant and potentially disruptive factor [15]. In a financial context,\nbit commitment is usually thought of as a technique for making encrypted predictions that can be decrypted and\nchecked after the event. However, in an appropriately regulated framework, it could also be used to commit parties\nto trades without immediately making the trade public, or even without immediately informing one of the trading\nparties (who would have to have agreed to a regulatory framework in which the risks and disadvantages of such blind\ntransactions were appropriately managed and compensated). The techniques described here thus illustrate, inter alia,\nthat light speed signalling constraints also offer a tool for either traders or regulators to reshape market dynamics\nvia secure commitments. In a possible future world in which conventional cryptosystems are rendered suspect by\nquantum computers or other developments, they may be the only reliably secure techniques.\n\nIII.\n\nBIT COMMITMENT WITH FLYING QUDITS\n\nWe begin by idealizing to simplify the presentation of the essential idea. We will relax these unphysical idealized\nassumptions later. We suppose that space-time is Minkowski and that nature is described by some appropriate\nrelativistic version of quantum theory. We suppose that both parties, the committer (Alice) and the recipient (Bob),\nhave arbitrarily efficient technology, limited only by physical principles. We suppose that all their operations and\ncommunications are error-free and that Alice can carry out quantum operations instantaneously. We also suppose they\nagree in advance on some space-time point P , to which they have independent secure access, where the commitment\nwill commence.\nWe suppose they are independently and securely able to access every point1 in the causal future of P , and instantaneously process and exchange information there, and that each is able to keep information everywhere secure from\nthe other unless and until they choose to disclose it.2 We suppose also that they can securely exchange quantum\nstates at P , and at other relevant points to which they both have secure access.\nWe suppose too that Bob can keep a state private somewhere in the past of P and arrange to transfer it to Alice\nat P . Alice's operations on the state can then be kept private unless and until she chooses to return information to\nBob at some point(s) in the future of P . We also suppose that Alice can send any relevant states at light speed in\nprescribed directions along secure quantum channels.\nThey also agree on a fixed inertial reference frame, and two opposite spatial directions within that frame. We\ninitially simplify further by working in one space and one time dimension; we set c = 1 and take P to be the origin\nin the fixed frame coordinates (x, t) and the two spatial directions to be defined by the vectors v0 = (\u22121, 0) and\nv1 = (1, 0).\nBefore the commitment, Bob generates a random pure qudit state \u03c1 \u2208 C d , chosen from the uniform distribution,\nencoded in a physical system which (idealizing again) we take to be pointlike. He keeps it private until P , where he\ngives it to Alice. To commit to the bit i \u2208 {0, 1}, Alice sends the state \u03c1 along a secure channel at light speed in the\ndirection vi , i.e. along the line L0 = {(\u2212t, t), t > 0} (for 0) or the line L1 = {(t, t), t > 0} (for 1).\nIn the simplest implementation of this protocol, Alice's secure channel may be physically secured \u2013 for instance,\na shielded region of free space. In this case, to fit the standard model for mistrustful cryptography, we consider the\nrelevant channels as lying within Alice's secure laboratory. Alternatively, if Alice knows in advance the points at\nwhich she wishes to unveil her commitment, she can predistribute entangled states between P and these points, and\nimplement a secure channel by teleporting the unknown state to a point on the relevant light ray, broadcasting the\nclassical teleportation signal from P . Security here is guaranteed since the classical teleportation signals carry no\ninformation about either the transmitted state or (more importantly) the direction in which it is teleported.\nFor simplicity, we consider here the simplest implementation in which the state is directly securely transmitted.\nAlice can then unveil her commitment at any point along the transmitted light ray. To unveil a 0, Alice returns \u03c1\nto Bob at some point Q0 on L0 ; to unveil a 1, Alice returns \u03c1 to Bob at some point Q1 on L1 . Bob then carries\nout the appropriate projective measurement to verify that the returned qudit is \u03c1; if he gets the correct answer, he\naccepts the commitment as honestly unveiled; if not (given that at this stage of the discussion we make the idealized\nassumption of no errors), he has detected Alice cheating.\n\n1\n2\n\nAlice and Bob should be thought of here as agencies \u2013 which in the ideal case are represented everywhere in the future light cone of P\n\u2013 rather than individuals.\nIn a more realistic model, which deviates from our idealized scenario but can still illustrate all the key features of our discussion, Alice\nand Bob could both be large independent collaborative groups of people, with each group having its own independent secure network\nof quantum devices and channels distributed throughout a region in such a way that the two networks do not overlap but both includes\nsites close to any point where quantum states may be exchanged.\n\n\f3\nA.\n\nSecurity against Bob\n\nGiven our assumptions, the protocol is evidently secure against Bob, who learns nothing about Alice's choice until\nthe unveiling.\n\nB.\n1.\n\nSecurity against Alice\nNo perfect cheating strategy\n\nOnce Alice has carried out quantum operations of her choice at P , her strategy for optimizing the probability of\nsuccessfully unveiling 0 is independent of the unveiling point Q0 on L0 (and similarly for 1). Although Alice is free\nto choose the points Q0 and Q1 , and may vary them depending on other relevant information that reaches her from\nthe relevant past light cones, we may thus without loss of generality consider Q0 and Q1 as fixed.\nWhatever operations and strategies she chooses, Alice cannot guarantee both that she will be able to unveil successfully at Q0 if she (at Q0 ) chooses to, and also that she will be able to unveil successfully at Q1 if she (at Q1 ) chooses. If\nshe could, she would be able to guarantee a successful unveiling at both points, by following the appropriate strategies\nat both points. This would violate the no-cloning theorem, since she would be able to guarantee producing two copies\nof the unknown pure state \u03c1 in the frame in which Q0 and Q1 are contemporaneous. More fundamentally, from an\nintrinsically relativistic perspective, she would be violating the no-summoning theorem [13], an intrinsic feature of\nrelativistic quantum theory that extends the no-cloning theorem [16, 17] and the no-signalling principle. To see this,\nnote that she would be able to guarantee successfully responding to a summons from another party at Q0 , requiring\nher to produce the state \u03c1 at Q0 , and also to a similar summons at Q1 \u2013 and hence to both summonses, which is\nimpossible.\n\n2.\n\nFull security against cheating\n\nSuppose Alice decides, at (or in the past of) P , that she wishes to retain as much freedom as possible in her choice\nof which bit to unveil, and is willing to accept that this may entail some risk of being caught cheating. Specifically,\nshe wants to design a strategy which gives her a probability p0 of successfully unveiling the bit 0 at Q0 , should she\n(at Q0 ) decide she wishes to, and a probability p1 of successfully unveiling the bit 1 at Q1 , should she (at Q1 ) decide\nshe wishes to.\nAny quantum bit commitment protocol in which an honest committer can be certain of successful unveiling allows\nsuch strategies, in which the value of the unveiled bit is genuinely undetermined (not merely unknown to Alice) until\nthe unveiling, for any probabilities p0 and p1 with p0 + p1 = 1. To achieve this, the committer simply has to prepare\na state of the form\n\u221a\n\u221a\np0 |0iA |0iI + p1 |1iA |1iI ,\nwhere the |iI state is input as the committed bit and the entangled |iA state is stored until unveiling and then\nmeasured in the computational basis.3 Indeed, even classical bit commitment protocols can achieve a similiar outcome\nif the committer chooses their input randomly, without observing the random choice. In this case there is a definite\ncommitted bit value (and this is an important difference in some applications), but from Alice's perspective the\nunveiled bit remains unknown, with subjective probabilities obeying p0 + p1 = 1.\nA sensible definition of cheating thus requires that a cheating Alice can at least ensure that p0 + p1 > 1. More\nprecisely, we say a protocol with a security parameter N is unconditionally secure provided that, for any committing\nand unveiling strategies, we have p0 + p1 < 1 + \u000f(N ), where \u000f(N ) \u2192 0 as N \u2192 \u221e.\nIn our protocol, the security parameter is the qudit dimension d. Again, we can treat Q0 and Q1 as fixed. Suppose\nthat Alice carries out some fixed operations at P , with a view to giving herself some chance of successful unveiling at\neither Q0 or at Q1 . Let \u03c10 be the state she generates at Q0 if she subsequently follows the strategy that optimizes her\nchances of successfully unveiling there, and \u03c11 the corresponding state at Q1 . Again, we can treat Alice's decisions\nwhether to unveil at Q0 and Q1 as independent, and imagine that she chooses to unveil at both points. She then\nproduces, at space-like separated points, the states \u03c10 and \u03c11 (which may and generally will be mixed), which, roughly\n\n3\n\nSee e.g. Refs. [18, 19].\n\n\f4\nspeaking, are intended to be near-copies of the initial pure state \u03c1 that are as faithful as possible. More precisely,\nsince Bob tests the returned states \u03c1i by measuring the projector P\u03c1 onto the pure state \u03c1, the probability pi of each\nstate \u03c1i passing Bob's test is Tr(\u03c1\u03c1i ). We thus have\np0 + p1 = Tr(\u03c1\u03c10 ) + Tr(\u03c1\u03c11 ) .\nEffectively, in a reference frame in which Q0 and Q1 have the same time coordinate, Alice is attempting to implement\n1 \u2192 2 approximate cloning of the unknown state \u03c1. The expression on the right hand side, Tr(\u03c1\u03c10 ) + Tr(\u03c1\u03c11 ), is\na standard measure of fidelity for this task. If Alice's process ensures that Tr(\u03c1\u03c10 ) = Tr(\u03c1\u03c11 ), she is implementing\nsymmetric 1 \u2192 2 cloning; otherwise, her scheme is asymmetric. Optimality bounds on the fidelity have been proved[20\u2013\n28] in both cases. The symmetric bound suffices, since any asymmetric scheme can be symmetrized by randomization,\nPN \u22121\nwithout altering p0 + p1 (or in the 1 \u2192 N case, without altering i=0 pi ) , so there must be a symmetric scheme\nthat is optimal by this measure. However, in the 1 \u2192 2 case it seems a little more satisfying to use the explicit form\nfor the asymmetric bounds. For 1 \u2192 2 qudit cloning they give\np0 + p1 \u2264 2 \u2212\nwhere a2 + b2 +\n\n2ab\nd\n\nd\u22121 2\n(a + b2 )\nd\n\n= 1. Optimising via a Lagrange multiplier we find\np0 + p1 = Tr(\u03c1\u03c10 ) + Tr(\u03c1\u03c11 ) \u2264 1 +\n\n2\n.\nd+1\n\nWe thus indeed have unconditional security: the expression (p0 + p1 \u2212 1) (Alice's \"wiggle room\") is bounded by a\nterm that is O(d\u22121 ), i.e. O(exp(\u2212Cn)), where n is the number of qubits that Alice and Bob exchange.\nC.\n\nThe non-ideal case\n\nRealistically, the qudits used will not be pointlike physical systems, it will not be possible for Alice and Bob to\nhave secure access to precisely the same space-time point to exchange a qudit, and Alice may not be able to transmit\nqudits at precisely speed c. 4 Realistically, too, Alice's and Bob's operations will take nonzero time. All of these\nlimitations effectively introduce time delays at various stages of the protocol.\nThese delays can all be allowed for in a realistic definition of the task5 , without making the protocols insecure.\nHowever, they do affect the interval over which the commitment is guaranteed to be secure. To see this, suppose\nthat Alice and Bob attempt to implement a protocol which ideally prescribes that the qudit should be returned at\none of the points Q0 , . . . , Qn\u22121 . Let Q00 , . . . , Q0n\u22121 be the points at which Bob would actually be able to complete\nhis tests, given a real (non-ideal) implementation of the protocol, which allows Alice to return the qudit in specified\nfinite regions of space-time to the future of the points Qi . Bob can then only be confident that Alice was committed\nat points lying outside the past light-cones of the Q0i (i.e. that she has no guaranteed successful strategy for changing\nher commitment that relies on operations at any such points). In other words, although Alice may need in fact to be\ncommitted at the point P (and hence all points in its causal future) in order to implement her side of the protocol,\nthe security analysis will only persuade Bob that she was committed by some point (or in some region) that lies in\nthe future of P .6\nIf the Q0i are suitably close to the Q0i , this need not make any substantial difference, and thus may not be particularly\nrelevant unless great precision over the place and time at which Alice became committed is required. However, when\n\u2013 as may be the case in our stock market example \u2013 a relatively precise timing of Alice's commitment is potentially\ncrucial, it will be desirable to try to minimize the time delays arising in practical implementations.\nD.\n\nChannel losses and errors\n\nIn reality, Alice and Bob's operations will not be error-free. With some nonzero probability, the qudit state\nwill be altered somewhere between Bob's sending it to Alice and Alice returning it to Bob. Also, with some nonzero\n\n4\n5\n6\n\nEven if they are encoded by photons, they may be sent through some medium with lower light speed.\nCf. the corresponding discussion for the no-summoning theorem.[13]\nAs with other relativistic protocols, the fact that the local space-time geometry in the vicinity of the Earth is not exactly Minkowski\ncan also be allowed for.[12]\n\n\f5\nprobability, the qudit will either be lost somewhere between Bob's transmitting it at some point P 0 in the (presumably)\nnear past of P and his receiving it at Q00 or Q01 (because Bob's or Alice's channels are not perfect) or will fail to be\ndetected when received at Q00 or Q01 (because Bob's detectors are not perfect).\nThe possibility of losses can be countered by running N > 1 copies of the protocol, timed so that they are effectively\nrun in parallel. Instead of supplying a single random qudit to Alice at P , Bob supplies a labelled sequence of N\nindependently random qudits \u03c11 , . . . , \u03c1N , within a time interval short compared to the times and distances separating\nP and Q0i (in lab frame). To commit the bit value i, Alice is required to send all the qudits to the point Qi , and\nreturn them from there, with their original labels, to Bob at Q0i . Bob accepts the commitment as valid so long as his\ntests identify M qudits as those he originally sent, where M is statistically significantly above N/2, in the sense that\nthe probabilities p00 and p01 for Alice being able to satisfy this test at Q00 and Q01 satisfy p00 + p01 \u2264 1 + \u000f(d, N, M ),\nwhere \u000f(d, N, M ) is suitably small (and can be made arbitrarily small by suitable parameter choices).\nThis strategy of redundant parallel commitment also gives a way of countering channel and detector errors. Standard\n(and more efficient) error correction techniques can also be used for this purpose.\nThe possibility of losses and errors is always an issue in quantum cryptography, and always adds to the practical\nchallenges in implementing protocols. The protocols considered here are, of course, no exceptions. However, errors\nand losses raise no qualitatively new problems of principle for the protocols considered here. It is not the case, for\nexample, that any nonzero error or loss rate makes it impossible to implement a secure version of the protocol. On\nthe contrary, provided the loss and error rates are not too large, they can be countered by standard error correction\ntechniques, reducing the probability of false positives (Alice successfully cheating) and false negatives (Bob being\nunable to accept Alice's honest unveiling) to arbitrarily small agreed levels \u2013 which is the best scenario possible in\npractical cryptography.\n\nE.\n\nRelation to standard mistrustful cryptography\n\nNote that relaxing our idealized assumptions allows us to fit the task definition into a standard cryptographic model\n[12] for mistrustful parties in Minkowski space-time. The non-idealized case allows us to drop the assumption that\nAlice and Bob each have independent secure access to every space-time point. Instead, we can adopt the standard\nassumption that Alice and Bob control suitably configured disjoint regions of space-time, their \"laboratories\". Each\ntrusts the security of their laboratory and all devices contained within it, but need not trust anything outside their\nlaboratory.\nFor example, we can take Alice's laboratory to be a connected region of space-time that includes, near its boundary,\nP and all allowed unveiling points Qi , and includes light ray segments corresponding to the secure channels joining P\nto each Qi : this allows Alice to receive a state at P and transmit it securely to any Qi . We can take Bob's laboratory\nto be a disjoint connected region of space-time that includes a point P 0 in the near causal past of P , from which he\nsends the unknown state to P , and points Q0i in the near causal future of each possible unveiling point Qi , to which\nAlice is supposed to send the unveiled state if she unveils at Qi . This allows Bob to generate the unknown state\nsecurely, transmit it to P , and then Alice to transmit it securely to some Qi of her choice, and return it to Bob at\nQ0i , where he can test it securely. (See Figure 1.)\nAs is standard in mistrustful cryptographic scenarios, we assume that Alice and Bob are the only relevant parties\n\u2013 no one else is trying to interfere with their communications \u2013 and that they have classical and quantum channels\n(which in principle can be made arbitrarily close to error-free) allowing them to send classical and quantum signals\nbetween the relevant points.\nIt is perhaps worth stressing here that, as with all such models, the main purpose is to show that the task is welldefined and implementable according to standard definitions. The model is not meant to prescribe how the protocol\nmust be implemented in practice: for example, if Alice uses teleportation to transmit the qudit, her labs need not\nbe connected. The point here is only to note one sensible way of implementing the protocol that uses only standard\ncryptographic assumptions.\n\nF.\n\nThree dimensions and Committing more Data\n\nWe now consider three space dimensions, and suppose that Alice wants to commit to a value in {0, . . . , m \u2212 1}, for\nsome integer m \u2265 2. To achieve this we generalize the above protocol. We fix m distinct lightlike directions from the\n\n\f6\n\nFIG. 1: One implementation of the non-ideal protocol in 1 + 1 dimensions. (Not to scale.) Alice and Bob control disjoint\nregions of space-time, representing their respective secure laboratories. Bob sends the unknown state to Alice at point P , and\nshe propagates it at near light speed to one of the points Qi , from where she sends it for Bob to receive at Q0i . The arrows\nwithin Alice's lab denote light rays; the separations from P to the Qi are timelike to allow for delays at either end as well\nas possible subluminal communication. Note that, while Bob's laboratories here are disconnected, in more than one spatial\ndimension they can be connected without overlapping with Alice's.\n\ncommitment point P , defined by m distinct vectors vi in the agreed fixed inertial frame.7 To commit to the value i,\nAlice sends the received qudit from point P at light speed in the direction vi . To unveil her commitment, she returns\nthe qudit to Bob at some point Qi on the relevant forward light ray from P . By the reverse triangle inequality for\nfuture-oriented timelike and lightlike vectors in Minkowski space, any such point Qi is spacelike separated from any\nother such Qj (for j 6= i), and so Alice's decisions about unveiling at Qi cannot be influenced by her communicating\nto Qi information she learns at any point Qj on any of the other light rays.\nSuppose that Alice carries out some fixed operations at P , with a view to giving herself some chance of successful\nunveiling at each of the points Qi . Again, without loss of generality, we can analyse security while treating the Qi\nas fixed and (since an unveiling at Qi can be postponed to any future point on the relevant light ray) assuming they\nhave the same time coordinate in some inertial frame F . Let \u03c1i be the state Alice generates at Qi if she subsequently\nfollows the strategy that optimizes her chances of successfully unveiling there. Again, we can treat Alice's decisions\nwhether to unveil at Qi as independent of her actions at Qj for j 6= i, and imagine that she chooses to unveil at all\nm points. In the frame F , her actions then become an attempt at 1 \u2192 m cloning.\nThe optimality bound [20\u201323] for symmetric 1 \u2192 m qudit cloning implies, via the symmetrization argument\nmentioned earlier, that\nX\nX\npi =\nTr(\u03c1\u03c1i ) \u2264 1 + O(2md\u22121 ) .\ni\n\ni\n\nP\nWe thus have unconditional security in this case also: the expression ( i pi \u2212 1) is again bounded by a term that (for\nfixed m) is O(d\u22121 ), i.e. exponentially small in the number of qubits used.\nIn principle, this strategy of direction-dependent commitment allows an arbitrary amount of data to be securely\ncommitted and unveiled, using a single qudit, and within a fixed finite space-time volume. However, there are two\n\n7\n\nFor efficiency, if no other relevant constraints apply, the vectors should be roughly equally separated.\n\n\f7\nimportant caveats here.\nFirst, security requires that 2md\u22121 is small, meaning that the dimension d needs to scale at least8 linearly in m.\nSecond, Alice needs to be able to transmit from P in m distinct directions, and Bob needs to be able to distinguish\nm distinct unveiling points on the relevant light rays. Alice thus needs to be able to specify transmission directions\nto within a solid angle9 small compared to m\u22121 , and Bob needs to be able to distinguish separations small compared\nto the distances between the corresponding unveiling points. These precisions are thus exponential in the number of\nbits committed, log2 m. In realistic implementations, attaining such precisions should be considered as consuming\nresources that also scale at least exponentially in log2 m for large m.\nIV.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe new bit commitment protocols described here are theoretically interesting in that they make use of a property\nof relativistic quantum theory \u2013 which seems most fundamentally characterised by the no-summoning principle [13]\n\u2013 that has not previously been exploited cryptographically, and which looks likely to find many other applications.\nWorking out in full generality precisely which applications of bit commitment can be implemented using sequences of\nthese protocols poses some interesting theoretical and practical challenges.\nTo implement the protocol efficiently and reliably requires transmitting qudits efficiently and reliably (by teleportation, or within cryptographically secure regions of space), at near light speed along pre-determined alternative paths.\nIf one takes an optimistic view, common among quantum information scientists, technological barriers that currently\nprevent near-ideal implementation of quantum information processing and communication will ultimately be overcome. At some point, the transition to practical quantum information processing and communication will take place\n\u2013 and at that point the practicality of quantum computing motivates a transition from (newly vulnerable) classical\ncryptographic protocols to secure quantum protocols. This is sufficient motivation for the protocols described here: if\nand when practical and reliable quantum information processing technology emerges, they will be both practical and\npractically relevant.\nThat said, it is worth reviewing how practical the protocols already are with present technology. For a proof that\nthe basic concept can be implemented, Alice needs only be able to route photons at near light speed along alternative\npaths \u2013 which may be through free space \u2013 in regions which we can assume lie within her laboratory (and thus are\nsecure), and return the photons to Bob's detectors. Moreover, for a partial proof of concept, one might initially accept\nan unreliable implementation, in which Alice's commitments are sometimes verified by Bob but sometimes (because of\nlosses or errors) unverified. One might too accept implementations in which the photons travel at significantly lower\nthan light speed (along optical fibres of high refractive index): such implementations still guarantee a finite (though\nshorter) duration commitment, so long as the allowed unveiling points are space-like separated. Under some or all\nof these relaxed assumptions, the protocol seems well within the scope of current technology. How reliably it can\npresently be implemented, over what ranges, with what levels of security, and how small the transmission and other\ndelays can be made compared to the ideal protocol, are open questions, which we offer as challenges to the ingenuity\nof experimentalist colleagues.\nReturning to the optimistic long term view of quantum information technology, it seems to us that a plausible\nfuture cryptographic environment will require unconditional security for bit commitments of short duration, and that\nthese protocols may turn out to be the most efficient and easiest solutions. For example, one can imagine short term\ncommitments relating to a stock market being made and unveiled by two parties exchanging photon signals that are\ntransmitted along independently secure links. For such applications, it will be particularly interesting to explore and\nanalyse the security and efficiency of chaining protocols and redundant encoding (discussed in the Appendix).\nPrevious protocols [11, 12] that make use of the Minkowski causal structure to implement secure bit commitment\nrely on the fact that data introduced at one site is not available to an agent at a space-like separated site. As noted\nearlier, these protocols are immune to Mayers' and Lo-Chau's cheating strategies. The MLC strategies do, in principle,\ndefine an operation that the committer could carry out in order to cheat the protocols of Refs. [11, 12] by altering\ntheir commitment. However, this operation always depends on data introduced at a space-like separated site, and so\nis never knowable by the committer.\nThe protocols introduced here highlight another significant limitation of Mayers' and Lo-Chau's no-go theorems that\nappears to have previously gone unnoticed. Namely, in relativistic quantum theory, the unitary operation required\nfor a MLC attack can be known to both parties but impossible to implement physically, as it represents a spacelike\n\n8\n9\n\nOne might choose tighter security criteria in this case.\nOr angle, if the relevant directions lie in a plane.\n\n\f8\ntranslation that would violate causality. This reinforces the point \u2013 if any reinforcement were needed \u2013 that these\ncelebrated and fundamental theorems are correctly understood as applying specifically to protocols that rely only\non non-relativistic quantum mechanics. They can be extended to some important classes of relativistic protocols \u2013\nfor example those in which the unveiling point takes place at a fixed point in the causal future of all the operations\ncarried out in the commitment phase \u2013 but do not apply to general protocols based on relativistic quantum theory.\nLike all intrinsically quantum bit commitment protocols [18, 19], the protocols considered here allow the committer\nto commit a bit in quantum superposition, which is \"collapsed\" to a classical bit value only when unveiled. For\nsome important applications of bit commitment, this feature makes no essential difference. For example, if the bit\ncommitment encodes a prediction, allowing the committer to make a superposition of predictions merely gives them\nthe freedom to add a random element to their prediction \u2013 which is also possible with any classical bit commitment\nscheme, since the committer can always randomize their input. Indeed, for some intrinsically quantum applications,\nin which the ultimate aim is to unveil a quantum state, it may be a positive advantage that the scheme allows\ncommitment of a qubit rather than a bit. On the other hand, our scheme cannot be securely used in applications of\nbit commitment in which it is crucial that the committed bit takes a classical value fixed at (or before) commitment.\nIt bears reemphasizing that this is a quite general feature of intrinsically quantum bit commitment schemes, and quite\nseparate from the cheating possibilities pointed out by Mayers and Lo-Chau.10\nThe protocols we have described are unconditionally secure, but not necessarily optimally efficient, in the sense\nthat they achieve optimal security for given resources. It will be interesting to investigate the range of possible\nstrategies and their efficiencies. One particularly interesting possibility is to consider protocols based on summoning\nan entangled state. For example, Bob could generate a randomly chosen maximally entangled pair of qudits, and\ninitiate the commitment protocol by giving one of them to Alice \u2013 who must later return it as above \u2013 while he keeps\nthe other. To verify the unveiled commitment in this case, he needs to recombine his stored qudit with the returned\nqudit at a single site using secure quantum channels, or else carry out a non-local measurement. Either way, he cannot\ngenerally verify with certainty at the point of unveiling, but can do so at a future point.11\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nI thank Adam Brown for drawing my attention to Ref.

The fact that the unveiling location\nneeds to be on a light ray from the commitment point, in a direction depending on the committed bit, is, however,\npotentially a disadvantage. Whether it is problematic, and if so how much so, very much depends on the scenario in\nwhich the bit commitment is being used.\nFor example, if the trading centre of a stock market is physically localized around the point P , and Alice wants\nto commit at time 0 predictions of prices at a pre-agreed time t > 0, which she is happy to unveil as soon as the\ndata cannot be exploited by Bob, the protocol may be perfectly adequate, so long as they can securely exchange\ninformation at suitable points distance (t/2) from P in stock market rest frame (i.e. so long as t is not too large).\nOn the other hand, if Alice makes some prediction at time 0 which she may or may not wish to unveil, depending\non details of the market's behaviour after t = 0 \u2013 perhaps, for example, because the prediction is of some future\nevents conditioned on others, and she wishes to give away no information about her predictive abilities unless the\nconditioning events take place \u2013 then these protocols alone do not suffice. Alice's decision to unveil on any light ray\nfrom P must necessarily be made in ignorance of events at the location of P at later times.\n\nB.\n\nChaining commitments\n\nSome flexibility in the location of the unveiling point, relative to the commitment point, can be achieved by chaining\na number of our commitment protocols in sequence. For example, consider the following extended protocol. Alice\nand Bob fix P , as above, and a time interval T in their fixed inertial frame; they also fix the qudit dimension d.\nAt P , Bob initiates the protocol by giving Alice an unknown qudit, and she commits a bit by sending it along the\nappropriate light ray to points Q0 or Q1 , which have time coordinate T . Suppose, for example, she commits to 0. At\nQ0 , she returns the qudit to Bob, after acting on it with a randomly chosen d-dimensional teleportation operation.\nThis operation is specified by an integer j in {0, . . . , d2 \u2212 1}. Bob initiates a new data commitment protocol at Q0 ,\ngiving an Alice a qudit of pre-agreed dimension d0 (here d0 > d), which is used to commit to the value j. At Q1 , Alice\nand Bob go through the same operations, but here Alice simply returns a randomly chosen dummy qudit to Bob, and\ncommits to a randomly chosen value j 0 . This procedure can be iterated any number of times.\nTo unveil, Alice returns the qudits from the final commitment without any randomization operation, allowing Bob\nto infer the operations necessary to derandomize the qudits returned earlier, and hence the originally committed bit.\n\n\f10\nThis procedure has the advantage that Alice's final unveiling location (although randomly determined) will generally\nbe timelike rather than lightlike separated from P . By varying the parameters of the chained protocol the distribution\nof separations can be optimized (within the space of possible distributions) for any given task. Of course, chaining the\nprotocol requires extra quantum operations and communications from both parties, which moreover grow exponentially\nin the number of iterations. It may perhaps be possible to mitigate this by adapting techniques used [12] to eliminate\nexponential blow-ups for classical relativistic bit commitment protocols [11], which allow one to truncate successive\nlinked commitments after a fixed number of iterations and replace them by newly started commitments, while retaining\nsecurity.\nThis strategy remains to be fully explored. We mention chained protocols here to note that the strategy of making\nbit commitments by appropriate light speed transmission - or indeed using similar techniques for other cryptographic\napplications - is not as inflexible as it may initially seem from considering the simplest (unchained) protocols. We\nleave the analyses of resource optimization, practicality and security for chained protocols for a future discussion.\n\nC.\n\nRedundant encoding\n\nAnother valuable strategy is to run two or more implementations of the protocol in parallel, using different bit\ncodings. For example, in the basic one-dimensional protocol, Bob can give Alice two independently randomly generated\nunknown pure states, \u03c10 and \u03c11 , at the same point P . She follows the protocol described above with \u03c10 , sending it\nalong the line Li to commit to bit value i; she follows the protocol with reversed conventions for \u03c11 , sending it along\nthe line Li+1 (where i + 1 is defined modulo 2) to commit to bit value i. This allows her to unveil the commitment\nat any point Q0 on L0 or any point Q1 on L1 , regardless of the committed bit value. To prevent her cheating, she\nmust also be required to unveil at some point on the opposite line.\nGiving Alice this freedom ensures that the bit can be unveiled on an agreed light ray \u2013 or indeed, if the parties\nwish, at a pre-agreed point on that light ray. Note that if Bob accepts such an unveiling immediately Alice has scope\nfor a form of temporary cheating.12 For example, she could cheat by sending both \u03c10 and \u03c11 along the agreed light\nray L0 and then decide which to return to Bob at the unveiling point Q0 . However, any such cheating will not allow\nher to produce a consistent unveiling at Q1 . Her deception will thus eventually become evident to Bob.13\nIn many scenarios \u2013 for example when individual commitments are part of an ongoing series of transactions of value\nto both parties \u2013 the opportunity to deceive Bob temporarily is of little value to Alice. Of course, in scenarios where\nBob can suffer significant loss through temporary deception, and cannot recover it once the cheating is exposed, he\nshould not accept Alice's unveiling until (i.e. at spacetime points where) he can combine all the relevant unveiling\ndata.\nNote that \u2013 with the above caveats about temporary cheating \u2013 redundant encoding can be combined with the\nchaining strategy described above, allowing Alice and Bob to ensure that the original commitment is unveiled at\nany point they wish in the causal future of P . In our stock market example, for instance, they can ensure that the\ncommitment is unveiled at the market location at any agreed future time.\n\n12\n13\n\n\"Temporary\" in the sense that at any spatial coordinate in any given inertial frame it will be at most temporarily effective.\n\"Eventually\" in the sense that, by broadcasting the results of his measurements on the states returned at Q0 and Q1 , and comparing\nthe results when they arrive at the same point, he can ensure that he will be aware of cheating at any or all points in the intersection\nof the causal futures of Q0 and Q1 .\n\n\f"}
