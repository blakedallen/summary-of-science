The fundamental experimental\nresult was obtained in this field in recent years - neutrino oscillations were discovered [1]. From the theory of this\nphenomenon (see, for example, [2]), which is based on the ideas of Pontecorvo [3] and Maki, Nakagawa and Sakata [4],\nit follows that oscillations are possible only when the neutrino mass is nonzero. As a consequence of this circumstance,\nthe possibility exists of neutrino spin rotation, i.e. of transitions between the active left-handed neutrino polarization\nstate and the sterile right-handed state. As it is understood today, in contrast to flavor oscillations, this process can\nnever be observed if the particle moves in vacuum. For the effect of spin rotation to exist some external influence leading\nto effective breaking of the Lorentz-symmetry of the theory is needed. For instance, dense matter or electromagnetic\nfields can serve as the physical reason for this phenomenon. In the latter case, nontrivial electromagnetic properties\nof the neutrino, in particular, the anomalous magnetic moment of a Dirac neutrino [5], can lead to rotation of its spin.\nThe conventional approach [6], [7] to the theory of neutrino spin rotation, based on solving the Cauchy problem\nfor the Schr\u00f6dinger-type equation with an effective Hamiltonian, was developed for the description of ultrarelativistic\nneutrinos (the particles that are observed in experiments now available). This approach is in fact quasiclassical and\nis equivalent to solving the Bargmann\u2013Michel\u2013Telegdi (BMT) equation [8] in the spinor representation (see [9]).\nThe aim of this work is to develop a consistent quantum theory of neutrino spin rotation to describe neutrinos\nwith nonzero mass, including the low-energy region that may play a significant role in astrophysics [10]. Following\npapers [6], [7], we use the method of effective potential [11] that allows us to take into account collective influence of\nbackground particles on the propagation of neutrino.\nTo this end, we find a complete system of solutions of the Dirac-type equation that describe the action of both\nelectromagnetic field and dense matter on neutrino dynamics. These solutions have the form of nonspreading wave\npackets. They enable one to consider the states of neutrino with rotating spin as pure quantum states and to evaluate\nprobabilities of various processes with participation of a neutrino in the framework of the Furry picture [12].\nThe paper is organized as follows. In the first Section we present the model we are working with and briefly describe\nhow the effective potentials are constructed. In Section II we summarize the main ideas of the method used for solving\nthe Dirac equation. In Section III we introduce a kinetic momentum operator and justify the advantages of using its\neigenvalues as quantum numbers, instead of the eigenvalues of the canonical momentum operator. Then we find both\nstationary and nonstationary wave functions. Here we also derive the dispersion law and calculate the group velocity\nfor a neutrino in the dense magnetized matter. We demonstrate that the group velocity of a neutrino is independent\nof its spin orientation. In Section IV we find the explicit expressions for the kinetic momentum and spin projection\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: arbuzova@uni-dubna.ru\naddress: lobanov@phys.msu.ru\n\u2021 Electronic address: murchikova@gmail.com\n\u2020 Electronic\n\n\f2\noperators. In Section V we use the obtained results for quasiclassical interpretation of neutrino spin behavior in dense\nmagnetized matter. In the conclusive Section VI we compare our results with those obtained by other authors.\nThe units ~ = c = 1 are used throughout the paper; metric tensor, g \u03bc\u03bd = diag(1, \u22121, \u22121, \u22121); totally antisymmetric\nLevi-Civit\u00e0 tensor, e\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03bb = +1 if {\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03bb} is an even permutation of {0, 1, 2, 3}, e\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03bb = \u22121 if it is an odd permutation,\ne\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03bb = 0 otherwise.\nI.\n\nWAVE EQUATION FOR NEUTRINO IN DENSE MATTER AND IN ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD\n\nLet us first discuss the model we use for the description of the neutrino behavior in the matter and in the electromagnetic field. At present, there are no experimental data that might help to make the choice between the Dirac or\nthe Majorana nature of a neutrino [13]. Therefore, in this paper we discuss spin rotation of a massive Dirac neutrino\nwith anomalous magnetic moment propagating through dense magnetized matter.\nAs a first approximation, we can consider spin rotation independently of variations of the particle flavor, i.e. we can\ndeal with the mass eigenstates of neutrino. It is quite obvious, due to the fact that the physical origins of neutrino\nflavor oscillations and its spin rotation are different. The Dirac\u2013Pauli equation [14] serves as the basis of this approach\nin electromagnetic fields. Just in this way, the behavior of the neutrino spin in a constant homogeneous magnetic field\nwas investigated in [15]. In order to consider the influence of matter on neutrino dynamics through weak interaction,\nthe Dirac\u2013Pauli equation should be modified.\nAs it was proposed in [11], [16], if matter density is high enough for considering weak interaction of neutrino\nwith the background fermions as coherent, it is possible to describe neutrino interaction with matter by an effective\npotential. To get covariant realization of this idea, it is necessary to take into account that the term that describes\ndirect interaction of neutrino with matter must depend on the currents\njf\u03bc = {nf u0f , nf uf },\n\n(1.1)\n\nand on the polarizations\n\u03bb\u03bcf =\n\n\u001a\n\nnf (\u03b6 f * uf ), nf\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\u001b\nuf (\u03b6 f * uf )\n\u03b6f +\n1 + u0\n\n(1.2)\n\nof the background fermions f [17\u201319]. It is significant that only jf\u03bc and \u03bb\u03bcf characterize matter integrally. In formulas\n(1.1) and (1.2), nf and \u03b6 f (0 6 |\u03b6 f |2 6 1) are the number density and the mean value of the polarization vector of\nthe background fermions f in the center-of-mass system of matter (u\u03bcf = {u0f , uf } denotes the four-velocity of the\nreference frame), where the mean momentum of the fermions f is equal to zero.\nIn the framework of the standard model (for a more general case, see Appendix A), the interaction term can be\nderived directly from the model Lagrangian. To this end, it is necessary to write this Lagrangian in the low-energy\neffective form using the four-fermion interaction and replace the vector \u03c8\u0304f (x)\u03b3 \u03bc \u03c8f (x) and axial vector \u03c8\u0304f (x)\u03b3 5 \u03b3 \u03bc \u03c8f (x)\ncurrents of the background fermions by jf\u03bc and \u03bb\u03bcf respectively. The explicit form of jf\u03bc and \u03bb\u03bcf is obtained as a\nresult of averaging of currents over the fermion statistical distribution function and depends on the type of the matter\nconsidered. In particular, the expression for the polarization \u03bb\u03bce of electron gas in a magnetic field at finite temperature\ncan be found in [7]. Note that, since the origin of the effective potential is forward elastic scattering of neutrino, it\ncan also be calculated using field-theoretic methods [20].\nAs a result we come to the equation\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\ni\ni\u03b3 \u03bc \u2202\u03bc \u2212 \u03b3 \u03bc f\u03bc (1 + \u03b3 5 ) \u2212 \u03bc0 F \u03bc\u03bd \u03c3\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 m \u03a8 (x) = 0,\n(1.3)\n2\n2\nwhere F \u03bc\u03bd is the electromagnetic field tensor.

In order to construct a mathematically\nconsistent approach to a description of neutrino spin rotation, we have to avoid the correlations. This is possible if we\nassume that the effective potential which describes the influence of dense matter on neutrino is the same for different\nflavors. In this case we can construct flavor states of the neutrino as the linear combination of its mass states with\ncoefficients that are elements of the mixing matrix of the neutrino in vacuum.\nThe physical justification of this model can be made in the following way. In order to consider effective potentials\nas flavor independent, it is necessary to assume that the fraction of electrons in the matter is small, i.e. the electron\nnumber density ne is approximately equal to zero. Calculations which are in a satisfactory agreement with the\nexperimental data show that in the center of a neutron star the fraction of electrons does not exceed a few per cent\n[21]. Therefore the model approximation ne = 0 is quite appropriate.\nWe restrict ourselves to considering equation (1.3) in the case of a constant homogeneous electromagnetic field and\nconstant currents and polarizations of matter,\nF \u03bc\u03bd = const,\n\njf\u03bc = const,\n\n\u03bb\u03bcf = const,\n\n(1.6)\n\nas the first order approximation of the realistic background. Because of (1.6) additional conditions for F \u03bc\u03bd and\nf \u03bc may be obtained. The strengths of the electric and magnetic fields and average currents and polarizations of the\nbackground particles should obey the self-consistent system of equations including the Maxwell equations, the Lorentz\nequation\nj\u0307f\u03bc =\n\nef \u03bc \u03bd\nF j ,\nmf \u03bd f\n\nand the the BMT quasiclassical spin evolution equation\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0010\n\u0011\nef \u03bc\n\u03bd\n\u03bb\u0307\u03bcf =\nF \u03bd + 2\u03bcf g \u03bc\u03b1 \u2212 u\u03bcf u\u03b1\nF\n\u03b1\u03bd \u03bbf .\nf\nmf\n\n(1.7)\n\n(1.8)\n\nHere the dot denotes differentiation with respect to the proper times \u03c4f of particles. From equations (1.7) and (1.8)\nwe find that for charged particles the conditions j\u0307f\u03bc = 0, \u03bb\u0307\u03bcf = 0 are equivalent to F \u03bc\u03bd jf\u03bd = 0, F \u03bc\u03bd \u03bb\u03bdf = 0. However,\nit seems reasonable to assume that in dense matter velocities of the center-of-mass systems for all components are\nequal, thus for the neutral particles similar conditions should hold as well. In this way we obtain the restriction\nF \u03bc\u03bd f\u03bd = 0.\n\n(1.9)\n\nIt should be emphasized that condition (1.9) is the result of the fact that average currents and polarizations of particles\nof matter in an external field should satisfy the classical equations of motion. The physical meaning of this condition\nis discussed in more detail in Section V.\nNote that equation (1.3) with constant coefficients appears in the standard model extension [22], [23] as well. In\nthis case, F \u03bc\u03bd and f \u03bc describe vacuum condensates that break the Lorentz-symmetry of the theory.\nII.\n\nFORMULATION OF THE PROBLEM\n\nThe Dirac equation, in particular equation (1.3), is a partial differential equation. Therefore, as it is known, its\ngeneral solution is defined up to an arbitrary function. However, in quantum-mechanical applications we deal with\nthe so-called complete integral which depends on a set of constants, i.e. quantum numbers. Those are the eigenvalues\nof some self-adjoint operators. For the classification of particle states it is necessary to introduce the complete set\nof the operators - integrals of motion. Note that in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics any self-adjoint operator\nmay serve as an operator of observable, which is not the case in the relativistic mechanics, where only integrals of\nmotion, commuting with the operator of the equation, can be treated as operators of observables [24]. The choice of\nthe complete set of them is different in each particular case and should be adequate to the problem being solved.\nIn the case of the problem of spin evolution, operators of kinetic momentum components should be included in the\ncomplete set. It becomes obvious if we start with the following argument. The direction of particle polarization is well\ndefined in its rest frame, and then one finds the polarization in the laboratory frame upon carrying out an appropriate\n\n\f4\nLorentz transformation. This transformation is defined by the group velocity of the particle, in other words, by its\nkinetic momentum. This implies that it is not the canonical momentum but the kinetic momentum operator that\ndefines the direction of particle propagation.\nNow, there is only one problem that remains to be solved. The form of the kinetic momentum operator for a\nparticle with spin propagating under the influence of external fields is not known beforehand. So we have to find a\nself-adjoint operator p\u03bc with the eigenvalues q \u03bc , which satisfies the condition q 2 = m2 and may be interpreted as the\ncomponents of the particle kinetic momentum.\nLet us discuss this issue in more detail. In the mathematical apparatus of quantum field theory, a particle is usually\nidentified with an irreducible unitary representation of the Poincar\u00e9 group [25]. The irreducible representations are\ncharacterized by two invariants of the group\nP 2 \u2261 P \u03bc P\u03bc = m2 ,\n\n(2.1)\n\nW 2 \u2261 W \u03bc W\u03bc = \u2212m2 s(s + 1).\n\n(2.2)\n\nThe translation generators P \u03bc are identified with the components of the particle momentum, and the Pauli\u2013Lubanski\u2013\nBargmann vector\nW\u03bc = \u2212\n\n1 \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03bb\ne\nM\u03bd\u03c1 P\u03bb ,\n2\n\n(2.3)\n\nwhere M \u03bc\u03bd are the Lorentz generators, characterizes the particle spin. The invariant m2 is the particle mass squared\nand s is the value of its spin.\nA space of unitary representation is defined by the condition called \"the wave equation for a particle with mass m\nand spin s.\" The wave equation for particles with spin s = 1/2 is the Dirac equation\n(i\u03b3 \u03bc \u2202\u03bc \u2212 m) \u03a80 (x) = 0.\n\n(2.4)\n\nIn this case the realization of generators of the Poincar\u00e9 group and the Pauli\u2013Lubanski\u2013Bargmann vector in the\ncoordinate representation is\np\u03bc = i\u2202 \u03bc ,\n\ni\nm\u03bc\u03bd = i(x\u03bc \u2202 \u03bd \u2212 x\u03bd \u2202 \u03bc ) + \u03c3 \u03bc\u03bd ,\n2\n\nw\u03bc =\n\ni 5 \u03bc\u03bd\n\u03b3 \u03c3 \u2202\u03bd .\n4\n\n(2.5)\n\nThese operators commute with the operator of the Dirac equation and can be identified with observables. They\nhave a self-adjoint extension on the subsets of solutions of equation (2.4) with a fixed sign of the energy with regard\nto the standard scalar product,\nZ\n(\u03a6, \u03a8 ) = dx \u03a6\u2020 (x, t) \u03a8 (x, t).\n(2.6)\nThree-dimensional spin projection operator s(p) is a set of coefficients si (p) of the expansion of the vector w\u03bc in\nspacelike unit vectors Si\u03bc (p) (i = 1, 2, 3):\nsi (p) = \u2212\n\n1\nw\u03bc Si\u03bc (p),\nm\n\n(2.7)\n\nwhere\np\u03bc Si\u03bc (p) = 0,\n\nSi\u03bc (p)S\u03bcj (p) = \u2212\u03b4ij .\n\n(2.8)\n\nObviously,\n\u0002\n\n\u0003\nsi (p), sj (p) = ieijk sk (p).\n\n(2.9)\n\nThe choice of these unit vectors is not unique, and it is possible to construct operators that determine the spin\nprojection on any direction in an arbitrary Lorentz frame.\nThe above description of the particle characteristics cannot be directly used in the presence of external fields, where\noperators (2.5) are not necessarily integrals of motion. In this case the classification of particle states is usually realized\nby linear combinations of operators p\u03bc and w\u03bc with coefficients depending on coordinates [26]. Unfortunately, the\nphysical meaning of these operators is usually not quite clear. Therefore, one should formulate a description of the\nparticle motion in an external field in the same clear and detailed way as for a free particle.\n\n\f5\nThis can be achieved basing on the following ideas. Since an irreducible representation of group is defined accurately\nup to an equivalence transformation, it is reasonable to state the problem of finding such realization of the Lie algebra\nof the Poincar\u00e9 group for which the condition of irreducibility of the representation leads to wave equation describing\na particle in a given external background. To solve this problem it is necessary to find a unitary operator U (x, x0 )\nwhich converts solutions of the wave equation for a free particle (2.4) to solutions \u03a8 (x) of (1.3):\nU (x, x0 )\u03a80 (x) = \u03a8 (x).\nThus, U (x, x0 ) is an intertwining operator in the\nequation\n\u0012\n1\ni\u03b3 \u03bc \u2202\u03bc \u2212 \u03b3 \u03bc f\u03bc (1 + \u03b3 5 ) \u2212\n2\n\n(2.10)\n\nsense of Darboux [27]. This operator in our case should satisfy the\ni\n\u03bc0 F \u03bc\u03bd \u03c3\u03bc\u03bd\n2\n\n\u0013\n\nU (x, x0 ) \u2212 U (x, x0 ) (i\u03b3 \u03bc \u2202\u03bc ) = 0.\n\n(2.11)\n\nTherefore, operators\np\u03bc = U (x, x0 )p\u03bc U \u22121 (x, x0 ),\n\nm\u03bc\u03bd = U (x, x0 )m\u03bc\u03bd U \u22121 (x, x0 )\n\n(2.12)\n\ncommute with the operator of the wave equation. As a consequence, the Pauli\u2013Lubanski\u2013Bargmann vector W\u03bc and\nthe components of the three-dimensional spin projection operator Si can be constructed in the same way as in the\ncase of a free particle:\nW\u03bc = \u2212\n\n1 \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03bb\ne\nm\u03bd\u03c1 p\u03bb ,\n2\n\nSi = \u2212\n\n1\nW\u03bc Si\u03bc (p).\nm\n\n(2.13)\n\nThe above statement may be reduced to the following: the wave function of a neutrino in dense matter can be\nderived with the help of a solution of the Dirac equation for a free particle and of some unitary evolution operator.\nA complete set of integrals of motion may be constructed with the help of operators (2.12). The physical meaning of\neigenvalues of observables, i.e. quantum numbers, is clear enough then. However, in the general case, U (x, x0 ) is an\nintegral operator and, as a consequence, operators (2.12) are also integral ones, so it is difficult to find U (x, x0 ) by\ndirect calculations. That is why we are trying to find the evolution operator for equation (1.3) using the correspondence\nprinciple.\nIII.\n\nWAVE FUNCTIONS\n\nWhen motion of a massive particle with spin in electromagnetic fields is described in the framework of the quasiclassical approach, we use two four-vectors, namely the four-velocity u\u03bc and the spin vector S \u03bc obeying the conditions\nu2 = 1,\n\nS 2 = \u22121,\n\n(uS) \u2261 u\u03bc S\u03bc = 0.\n\n(3.1)\n\nThese vectors are solutions of the Lorentz and BMT equations, respectively. As it was shown in [28], both fourvectors can be constructed with the help of one and the same evolution operator that acts on different initial values of\nthese four-vectors, satisfying relations (3.1). In other words, the evolution operator for the BMT equation completely\ndescribes quasiclassical behavior of the particle.\nAs far as the neutrino is a neutral particle, the BMT equation for the spin vector S \u03bc of a neutrino moving with the\nfour-velocity u\u03bc has the form\n\u1e60 \u03bc = 2\u03bc0 (g \u03bc\u03b1 \u2212 u\u03bc u\u03b1 ) F\u03b1\u03bd S \u03bd .\n\n(3.2)\n\nWe can extend the BMT equation to include weak interaction between the neutrino and dense matter. It was shown\nphenomenologically in [29] that if effects of neutrino weak interactions are taken into account, the Lorentz-invariant\ngeneralization of the BMT equation is\n\u1e60 \u03bc = 2 (g \u03bc\u03b1 \u2212 u\u03bc u\u03b1 ) (\u03bc0 F\u03b1\u03bd + G\u03b1\u03bd ) S \u03bd ,\n\n(3.3)\n\nwhere\nG\u03bc\u03bd =\n\n1 \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03bb\ne\nf\u03c1 u\u03bb .\n2\n\nWe can get an analogous result by averaging the equations of motion for the Heisenberg operators (see [30]).\n\n(3.4)\n\n\f6\nA remarkable feature of the BMT equation is its universality - at least in the zeroth order of the Planck constant,\nparticles with an arbitrary spin may be described by the same BMT equation. However, a part of the information\nabout the particle behavior gets lost due to distinctions in transformation properties of the states of the particles with\ndifferent spins. This information may be restored in the following way. We can describe a particle using quasiclassical\nspin wave functions \u03a8 (\u03c4 ) constructed in such a way that the vector current\njV\u03bc (\u03c4 ) = \u03a8\u0304 (\u03c4 )\u03b3 \u03bc \u03a8 (\u03c4 ),\n\n(3.5)\n\n\u03bc\njA\n(\u03c4 ) = \u03a8\u0304 (\u03c4 )\u03b3 5 \u03b3 \u03bc \u03a8 (\u03c4 )\n\n(3.6)\n\nas well as the axial current\n\nbuilt on their base, obey the BMT equation, and, as a consequence, may be interpreted as four-velocity u\u03bc and spin\nvector S \u03bc respectively.\nWe can introduce quasiclassical spin wave functions as follows [31], [32]. Let the Lorentz equation be solved, i.e. the\ndependence of the particle coordinates on proper time is found. Then the BMT equation transforms to an ordinary\ndifferential equation, whose resolvent determines a one-parameter subgroup of the Lorentz group. The quasiclassical\nspin wave function is a spin tensor, whose evolution is determined by the same one-parameter subgroup. It is easy\nto verify (see Appendix C) that for a neutral particle, represented by a Dirac bispinor, the equation that defines the\nevolution operator for the wave function \u03a8 (\u03c4 ) takes the form\nU\u0307 (\u03c4, \u03c40 ) =\n\ni 5\n\u03b3 \u03c3\u03bc\u03bd \u03c6\u03bc q \u03bd U (\u03c4, \u03c40 ).\nm\n\n(3.7)\n\nHere \u03c6\u03bc = f \u03bc /2 + H \u03bc\u03bd q\u03bd /m, H \u03bc\u03bd = \u03bc0 \u22c6F \u03bc\u03bd , where \u22c6F \u03bc\u03bd = \u2212 21 e\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03bb F\u03c1\u03bb is the dual electromagnetic field tensor and\nq \u03bc = mu\u03bc .\nLet us look for a solution of equation (1.3) in the form\n\u03a8 (x) = e\u2212iK(x) U (\u03c4 (x), 0) \u03a80 (x),\n\n(3.8)\n\nwhere U (\u03c4, \u03c40 ) is an evolution operator for the quasiclassical spin wave function, e\u2212iK(x) is a phase factor, and \u03a80 (x)\nis a solution of the Dirac equation for a free particle. Since we assume that F \u03bc\u03bd and f \u03bc are constants, the evolution\noperator can be expressed as a matrix exponential,\n\u001b\n\u001a\ni 5\n\u03bc \u03bd\n\u03b3 \u03c3\u03bc\u03bd \u03c6 q (\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c40 ) ,\n(3.9)\nU (\u03c4, \u03c40 ) = exp\nm\nthat depends on constant four-vector q \u03bc satisfying the condition q 2 = m2 .\nUsing ansatz (3.8) we should choose such a basis in the space of solutions of the Dirac equation for the free particle\nthat the action of the evolution operator on each element of this basis be reduced to multiplication by one and the\nsame matrix function depending on quantum numbers of the basis. It is obvious that in our case we must choose the\nplane waves\n\u03a80 (x) = e\u2212i(qx) (1 \u2212 \u03b60 \u03b3 5 \u03b3\u03bc S0\u03bc (q))(\u03b3 \u03bc q\u03bc + m)\u03c80 .\n\n(3.10)\n\nHere S0\u03bc (q) determines the direction of polarization of the particle; \u03b60 = \u00b11 is the spin projection on S0\u03bc (q); \u03c80 is a\nconstant four-component spinor. The wave function is normalized by the condition\n\u03a8\u03040 (x)\u03a80 (x) = m/q0 ,\n\n(3.11)\n\nand four-vector q \u03bc is a kinetic momentum of the particle. Though the explicit form of a kinetic momentum operator for a particle with spin interacting with dense matter and electromagnetic field is not known beforehand, the\ncorrespondence principle allows us to construct solutions characterized by its eigenvalues.\nNaturally, as far as equation (1.3) is invariant under translations the canonical momentum operator p\u03bc = i\u2202 \u03bc is an\nintegral of motion for this equation, too. However, the commonly adopted choice of eigenvalues of this operator as\nquantum numbers is not satisfactory if we prefer spin projection operators with clear physical meaning. The directions\nof canonical and kinetic momenta are different in the general case (see [23]) and, as it was already mentioned in Section\nII, projection of the spin is well defined in the rest frame of the particle where its kinetic momentum is equal to zero:\nq = 0. That is why in the construction of spin projection operators (see (2.7)) it is necessary to select unit vectors\northogonal to four-vector q \u03bc .\n\n\f7\nLet us find the proper time \u03c4 (x) and the phase factor K(x). Substitution of (3.8) into (1.3) gives\n\u001a\n1\n1\n\u03b3 \u03bc q\u03bc + \u03b3 \u03bc \u2202\u03bc K(x) \u2212 \u03b3 \u03bc f\u03bc (1 + \u03b3 5 ) + \u03b3 5 \u03c3\u03bc\u03bd \u03c6\u03bc q \u03bd \u03b3 \u03b1 N\u03b1\n2\nm\n\u001b\ni\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\u2212iK(x)\n\u2212 \u03bc0 F \u03c3\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 m e\nU (\u03c4 (x))\u03a80 (x) = 0,\n2\nwhere N \u03bc = \u2202 \u03bc \u03c4 . Since the matrix U (\u03c4 (x)) is nondegenerate and the commutator [\u03b3 \u03bc q\u03bc , U (\u03c4 (x))] is zero, we get\n1\n1\ni\n\u03b3 \u03bc \u2202\u03bc K(x) \u2212 \u03b3 \u03bc f\u03bc (1 + \u03b3 5 ) + \u03b3 5 \u03c3\u03bc\u03bd \u03c6\u03bc q \u03bd \u03b3 \u03b1 N\u03b1 \u2212 \u03bc0 F \u03bc\u03bd \u03c3\u03bc\u03bd = 0.\n2\nm\n2\nTo solve this equation for N \u03bc and K(x), we should set the coefficients at the linearly independent elements of the\nalgebra of the Dirac matrices equal to zero. Thus\n\u2202 \u03bc K(x) = f \u03bc /2,\n\n(3.12)\n\nand the system that defines the vector N \u03bc is\n\u03c6\u03bc (m \u2212 (N q)) + (N \u03c6)q \u03bc = 0,\n\n\u03bc0 F \u03bc\u03b1 q\u03b1 = \u2212e\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03bb N\u03bd \u03c6\u03c1 q\u03bb ,\n\n(3.13)\n\nThe system is consistent provided that\nq\u03bc F \u03bc\u03bd \u03c6\u03bd = 0.\n\n(3.14)\n\nEquation (3.14) must be held for an arbitrary q \u03bc , so we have\n\u22c6 \u03bc\u03b1\n\nF\n\n1\nF\u03b1\u03bd \u2261 \u2212 \u03b4\u03bd\u03bc \u22c6F \u03b1\u03b2 F\u03b1\u03b2 = 0,\n4\nF \u03bc\u03bd f\u03bd = 0.\n\n(3.15)\n\n(3.16)\n\nAny antisymmetric tensor has an eigenvector corresponding to zero eigenvalue if and only if its second invariant\nI2 = 41 \u22c6F \u03bc\u03bd F\u03bc\u03bd is equal to zero. That is why conditions (3.15) and (3.16) are not independent and (3.15) is a\nconsequence of (3.16). Comparing it with (1.9), we see that the condition obtained basing on the physical reasons\nalone and condition (3.16) totally coincide. This ensures quasiclassical behavior of the particle in the background\nmedium and allows obtaining the solution of equation (1.3) in the form of (3.8).\nUsing an orthogonal basis in the Minkowski space,\nH \u03bc\u03bd q\u03bd\nF \u03bc\u03bd q\u03bd\nm2 H \u03bc\u03bd H\u03bd\u03b1 q \u03b1 \u2212 q \u03bc N\np\n,\nn\u03bc0 = q \u03bc /m, n\u03bc1 = \u221a\n, n\u03bc2 = p , n\u03bc3 =\nN\nm N \u00d1\n\u00d1\n\n(3.17)\n\nwhere N = q\u03bc H \u03bc\u03c1 H\u03c1\u03bd q \u03bd , \u00d1 = \u03bc20 q\u03bc F \u03bc\u03c1 F\u03c1\u03bd q \u03bd , and relations (B3), (B4) from Appendix B, we find\nN \u03bc = \u2212q \u03bc\n\nm(f \u03c6)\nm3 (f \u03c6)\n\u03bc m\n\u03bc\n+\nf\n+\n\u03c6\n.\n2((\u03c6q)2 \u2212 m2 \u03c62 )\n2(\u03c6q)\n2(\u03c6q)((\u03c6q)2 \u2212 m2 \u03c62 )\n\n(3.18)\n\nAccording to the fact that f \u03bc and N \u03bc are constant values we obtain the proper time\n\u03c4 = (N x),\n\n(3.19)\n\nK(x) = (f x)/2,\n\n(3.20)\n\nand the phase factor\n\nwhich determines an energy shift of the neutrino in matter.\nNow we can derive the expression for the wave function:\n\u03a8q\u03b60 (x) =\n\n1 X \u2212i(P\u03b6 x)\n\u03bc\ne\n(1 \u2212 \u03b6\u03b3 5 \u03b3\u03bc Stp\n(q))(1 \u2212 \u03b60 \u03b3 5 \u03b3\u03bc S0\u03bc (q))(\u03b3 \u03bc q\u03bc + m)\u03c80 ,\n2\n\u03b6=\u00b11\n\n(3.21)\n\n\f8\nwhere\n\u0013\n\u0012\np\n(f \u03c6)\n(\u03c6q)2 \u2212 \u03c62 m2 /m = q \u03bc 1 + \u03b6 p\n2 (\u03c6q)2 \u2212 m2 \u03c62\np\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03b6 (\u03c6q)2 \u2212 m2 \u03c62\n1\n\u03b6(f \u03c6)m2\np\n,\n+ f\u03bc 1 \u2212\n\u2212 \u03c6\u03bc\n2\n(\u03c6q)\n2(\u03c6q) (\u03c6q)2 \u2212 m2 \u03c62\n\nP\u03b6\u03bc = q \u03bc + f \u03bc /2 \u2212 \u03b6N \u03bc\n\nq \u03bc (\u03c6q)/m \u2212 \u03c6\u03bc m\n\u03bc\nStp\n(q) = p\n.\n(\u03c6q)2 \u2212 \u03c62 m2\n\n(3.22)\n\n(3.23)\n\nSystem (3.21) represents the complete system of solutions of equation (1.3) characterized by kinetic momentum of\nthe particle q \u03bc and the quantum number \u03b60 = \u00b11 which can be interpreted as the neutrino spin projection on the\ndirection S0\u03bc (q) at \u03c4 = (N x) = 0.\nSystem (3.21) is nonstationary in the general case.

However, in interactions with other particles some channels\nof reactions which are closed for a free neutrino can be opened due to the modification of the dispersion law (see, for\nexample, [19], [36], [37]).\nLet us discuss now properties of nonstationary solutions in more detail. Solution (3.21) is a plane-wave solution of\nequation (1.3), describing a pure quantum-mechanical state of a neutral particle with a nonconserved spin projection\non the fixed space axis. Solutions (3.21) do not form an orthogonal basis. However, the considered system is not\novercomplete, since the spectrum of the spin projection operator is finite. So the system can be easily orthogonalized.\nGeneralization of the basis (3.24) is\nq\n1 X \u2212i(P\u03b6 x)\n\u03bc\n\u03a8\u0303q\u03b60 (x) =\n(3.30)\n|J\u03b6 (q)|(1 \u2212 \u03b6\u03b3 5 \u03b3\u03bc Stp\n(q))(1 \u2212 \u03b60 \u03b3 5 \u03b3\u03bc S0\u03bc (q))(\u03b3 \u03bc q\u03bc + m)\u03c80 .\ne\n2\n\u03b6=\u00b11\n\nThus we have just established that the unitary intertwining operator (2.10) in our case is the Fourier integral\noperator [38] and it acts on elements of the plane-wave basis of solutions of the free particle Dirac equation (3.10) in\nthe following way:\nq\n1 X \u2212i((P\u03b6 \u2212q)x)\n\u03bc\n\u03a8\u0303q\u03b60 (x) = U (x, x0 )\u03a80 (x) =\n|J\u03b6 (q)|(1 \u2212 \u03b6\u03b3 5 \u03b3\u03bc Stp\n(q))\u03a80 (x).\n(3.31)\ne\n2\n\u03b6=\u00b11\n\nAction of the inverse operator is defined by the formula\n\u03a80 (x) = U \u22121 (x, x0 )\u03a8\u0303q\u03b60 (x) =\n\n1\n1 X i((P\u03b6 \u2212q)x)\n\u03bc\np\n(1 \u2212 \u03b6\u03b3 5 \u03b3\u03bc Stp\n(q))\u03a8\u0303q\u03b60 (x).\ne\n2\n|J\u03b6 (q)|\n\n(3.32)\n\n\u03b6=\u00b11\n\nSince the intertwining operator is defined on the elements of the basis, its action on an arbitrary solution is defined\nas well. Hence, the explicit form of this operator as a function of coordinates and differential operators can be easily\nobtained.\nNote that an attempt to construct intertwining operator for equation (1.3) was undertaken in [39] for the case where\nonly parameter f \u03bc is nontrivial. The result of the action of the operator suggested in [39] on plane-wave solutions of\nthe Dirac equation for a free particle coincides with solutions obtained in our previous work [19] for this particular\ncase, and which can be derived from (3.21), if one sets F \u03bc\u03bd = 0. We should emphasize that solutions (3.21) do not\nform an orthogonal basis. As a consequence of this fact, the intertwining operator suggested in [39] is not unitary\nwith regard to the standard scalar product (2.6).\nThe case of a massless neutrino is quite special. Equation (3.7) obviously does not hold in the limit m \u2192 0 because\nmassless particle helicity is conserved, while the BMT equation describes spin rotation. To find wave functions\nof massless neutrino, one must take into account that from the mathematical point of view, the small group of\nrepresentation of the Poincar\u00e9 group for a massive particle differ from that for a massless particle (see, for example,\n[25]). The small group for a massive particle is the rotation group of three-dimensional Euclidian space O+ (3), and\nnontrivial magnetic and electric moments are allowed. In contrast to that, the small group for a massless particle\nis the movement group of Euclidian plane E(2), which outlaws nonzero magnetic moment as well as electric one or\nother nontrivial coefficients \u03bcn and \u03b5\u2032n in equation (A2). Therefore, one has to put \u03bc0 = 0 in equation (1.3). Then\ninstead of (3.24), we obtain\n\u03a8q\u03b6 (x)|m=0 = e\u2212i(qx)(1+\u03b6\u03b7) e\u2212i(f x)(1\u2212\u03b6)/2 |1 + \u03b6\u03b7|(1 \u2212 \u03b6\u03b3 5 )\u03b3 \u03bc q\u03bc \u03c80 ,\n\n(3.33)\n\n\u03a8q\u03b6 (x)|m=0 = ei(qx)(1+\u03b6\u03b7) e\u2212i(f x)(1+\u03b6)/2 |1 + \u03b6\u03b7|(1 + \u03b6\u03b3 5 )\u03b3 \u03bc q\u03bc \u03c80 ,\n\n(3.34)\n\nfor the neutrino, and\n\nfor the antineutrino. In these equations \u03b7 =\n\nf2\n2(f q)\n\nand q 2 = 0.\n\n\f10\nIV.\n\nOPERATORS OF OBSERVABLES\n\nLet us find the explicit forms of the kinetic momentum operators p\u03bc and the spin projection operator Stp in the\ncoordinate representation. For this purpose we might exploit formulas (2.12); however, we follow a simpler way.\nThe obtained solutions (3.24) are classified by eigenvalues of the operators p\u03bc and Stp , so\np\u03bc \u03a8q\u03b6 (x) = q \u03bc \u03a8q\u03b6 (x),\n\nStp \u03a8q\u03b6 (x) = \u03b6\u03a8q\u03b6 (x).\n\n(4.1)\n\nSince solutions (3.24) are also eigenfunctions of the canonical momentum operator p\u03bc = i\u2202 \u03bc with eigenvalues P\u03b6\u03bc , we\nhave\np\u03bc \u03a8q\u03b6 (x) = P\u03b6\u03bc \u03a8q\u03b6 (x).\n\n(4.2)\n\nNow we should express eigenvalues of the kinetic momentum operator q \u03bc in terms of eigenvalues of the canonical\nmomentum operator P\u03b6\u03bc . From (3.22) we have\n\"\n\nq \u03bc = P\u0303 \u03bc + f\n\np\n\n(\u03c6q)2 \u2212 m2 \u03c62\n\u03b6(f \u03c6)m2\np\n+ \u03c6\u03bc\n2(\u03c6q)\n2(\u03c6q) (\u03c6q)2 \u2212 m2 \u03c62\n\"\n#\u22121\n(f \u03c6)\n\u00d7 1+\u03b6 p\n.\n2 (\u03c6q)2 \u2212 m2 \u03c62\n\n\u03bc\u03b6\n\n#\n\n(4.3)\n\nWith the help of relations from Appendix B this can be rewritten as\nq \u03bc = P\u0303 \u03bc +\n\nP\u0303 \u03bc (\u03a6\u0303f ) \u2212 f \u03bc (f P\u0303 )/2 \u2212 2mH \u03bc\u03bd \u03a6\u0303\u03bd\n.\nP\u0303 2 \u2212 m2 + f 2 /4 + 2\u03bc20 I1 \u2212 (\u03a6\u0303f )\n\n(4.4)\n\nThe vector of total polarization in terms of the new variable is\nq \u03bc (\u03a6\u0303P\u0303 )/m \u2212 \u03a6\u0303\u03bc m\n\u03bc\n.\nStp\n(q) = \u2206 q\n(\u03a6\u0303P\u0303 )2 \u2212 m2 \u03a6\u03032\n\n(4.5)\n\nHere P\u0303 , \u03a6\u0303 and \u2206 are given by (3.28).\nBecause of (4.2) we can interpret P\u03b6\u03bc as a result of action of operator p\u03bc = i\u2202 \u03bc on the wave function. So by changing\nP\u0303 \u03bc \u21d2 p\u03bc \u2212 f \u03bc /2 and \u03a6\u0303\u03bc \u21d2 f \u03bc /2 + H \u03bc\u03bd (p\u03bd \u2212 f\u03bd /2)/m in formulas (4.4), (4.5), we obtain kinetic momentum operator\n\u03bc\np\u03bc and spin projection operator Stp = \u2212\u03b3 5 \u03b3\u03bc Stp\n(q) in the explicit form. These operators are pseudodifferential ones\n[38] and are determined on the solutions of equation (1.3) with fixed mass m.\nTo extend the domain of the definition of constructed operators, we need to replace mass m in (4.4) and (4.5) by\nthe matrix operator from equation (1.3):\n1\ni\nm = \u03b3 \u03bc p\u03bc \u2212 \u03b3 \u03bc f\u03bc (1 + \u03b3 5 ) \u2212 \u03bc0 F \u03bc\u03bd \u03c3\u03bc\u03bd ,\n2\n2\n2\nm2 = (p \u2212 f /2) \u2212 f 2 /4 + 2\u03bc20 I1 + \u03b3 5 \u03c3 \u03bc\u03bd f\u03bc p\u03bd + H \u03bc\u03bd \u03b3\u03bc f\u03bd (1 + \u03b3 5 ) + 2\u03b3 5 H \u03bc\u03bd \u03b3\u03bc p\u03bd .\n\n(4.6)\n\nIn this way we obtain the covariant form for p\u03bc and Stp .\nUnfortunately, the result of this substitution cannot be written as a compact formula, so we do not present it here.\nHowever, even if we do not know a covariant form of the operator p\u03bc , we may conclude that on the solutions of\nequation (1.3) the relations,\np 2 = m2 ,\n\n\u03b3 \u03bc p\u03bc = m,\n\n(4.7)\n\nshould hold. The first equality in (4.7) is obvious; to proof the second one, recall that according to (2.12)\nm = U (x, x0 )\u03b3 \u03bc p\u03bc U \u22121 (x, x0 ) = U (x, x0 )\u03b3 \u03bc U \u22121 (x, x0 )p\u03bc = (\u03b3 \u03bc + \u0393 \u03bc (q)) p\u03bc .\n\n(4.8)\n\n\u03bc\nFrom formulas (3.31) and (3.32) it follows that \u0393 \u03bc (q) \u223c Stp\n(q), and as a consequence \u0393 \u03bc (q)p\u03bc = 0. So equation (1.3)\nmay be represented as\n\n(\u03b3 \u03bc p\u03bc \u2212 m)\u03a8 (x) = 0.\n\n(4.9)\n\n\f11\nConsider now special cases where the presented technique looks quite clear. Discuss the influence on the neutrino\ndynamics of the electromagnetic field alone, i.e. assume that f \u03bc = 0. In this case eigenvalues of the kinetic momentum\noperator q \u03bc would be expressible in terms of eigenvalues of the canonical momentum operator P\u03b6\u03bc in the following\nway:\nq \u03bc = P\u03b6\u03bc \u2212\n\n2H \u03bc\u03b1 H\u03b1\u03bd P\u03b6\u03bd\n.\nP\u03b62 \u2212 m2 + 2\u03bc20 I1\n\n(4.10)\n\nThen the covariant form of the kinetic momentum operator is\nH \u03bc\u03b1 H\u03b1\u03bd p\u03bd\np \u03bc = p\u03bc + p\nS\u0303tp ,\np\u03b2 H\u03b2\u03b1 H \u03b1\u03c1 p\u03c1\n\n(4.11)\n\nand the spin projection operator Stp is defined by the formula\nStp\nHere\n\n!\n2\u03bc20 I1\nS\u0303tp S\u0303tp .\n= sign 1 + p\np\u03b2 H\u03b2\u03b1 H \u03b1\u03c1 p\u03c1\n\u03b3 5 \u03b3\u03bc H \u03bc\u03bd p\u03bd\nS\u0303tp = p\n.\np\u03b2 H\u03b2\u03b1 H \u03b1\u03c1 p\u03c1\n\n(4.12)\n\n(4.13)\n\nThus operator Stp has a simple physical meaning. It characterizes a particle spin projection on the direction of the\nmagnetic field in the rest frame of the particle.\nVice versa, when the electromagnetic field is absent, but f \u03bc is nontrivial, we have\n\u03bc\n\nq =\n\nP\u03b6\u03bc\n\nP\u03b6\u03bc f 2 \u2212 f \u03bc (f P\u03b6 )\n1 \u03bc\n,\n\u2212 f +\n2\n2(P\u03b62 \u2212 (P\u03b6 f ) \u2212 m2 )\n\n(4.14)\n\nand the covariant forms of the kinetic momentum and spin projection operators are\np \u03bc = p\u03bc \u2212\n\np\u03bc f 2 \u2212 f \u03bc (f p) \u03b1\u03bd\nf\u03bc\n\u2212 \u03b35\n\u03c3 f \u03b1 p\u03bd ,\n2\n2((pf )2 \u2212 p2 f 2 )\n\u03b3 5 \u03c3 \u03bc\u03bd f\u03bc p\u03bd\nStp = p\n.\n(pf )2 \u2212 p2 f 2\n\n(4.15)\n\n(4.16)\n\nNote that if the matter is at rest and nonpolarized (f = 0), then\nStp = sign(f 0 )\n\n(\u03a3 * p)\n,\n|p|\n\n(4.17)\n\nin other words Stp is equal to the standard helicity operator up to the sign.\nWe can find now spin projection operators for nonstationary wave functions (3.21) and (3.30). For this purpose,\nwe introduce operators S\u00b1 that act on the elements of system (3.24) as follows:\nS+ \u03a8q\u03b6 (x) =\n\n(1 \u2212 \u03b6)\n\u03a8q(\u2212\u03b6) (x),\n2\n\nS\u2212 \u03a8q\u03b6 (x) =\n\n(1 + \u03b6)\n\u03a8q(\u2212\u03b6) (x).\n2\n\n(4.18)\n\n1\nThen operators S1 = 21 (S+ + S\u2212 ), S2 = 2i\n(S+ \u2212 S\u2212 ) and S3 = 21 Stp correspond to elements of the Lie algebra of\nthe SU(2) group. Commutation relations for these operators are\n\n[Si , Sj ] = ieijk Sk .\n\n(4.19)\n\nTo determine the explicit realization of operators S\u00b1 on eigenfunctions of operator p\u03bc let us choose the basis Si\u03bc (q)\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n(see (2.8)) in the form Stp\n(q), S1\u03bc (q), S2\u03bc (q). Here Stp\n(q) is defined by relation (3.23), the other spacelike unit vectors\nare\nS1\u03bc (q) =\n\n\u03bc\nS0\u03bc (q) + Stp\n(q)(S0 (q)Stp (q))\np\n,\n1 \u2212 (S0 (q)Stp (q))2\n\nS2\u03bc (q) =\n\ne\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03bb q\u03bd S0\u03c1 (q)Stp\u03bb (q)\np\n.\nm 1 \u2212 (S0 (q)Stp (q))2\n\n(4.20)\n\n\f12\nAs a result we have\np\n1 |J\u03b6=\u00b11 (q)| \u00b12i\u03b8 5\nS\u00b1 = \u2212 p\ne\n\u03b3 \u03b3\u03bc (S1\u03bc (q) \u00b1 iS2\u03bc (q)) ,\n2 |J\u03b6=\u22131 (q)|\n\nwhere\n\np\n\u03b8 = (N x) (\u03c6q)2 \u2212 \u03c62 m2 /m.\n\n(4.21)\n\n(4.22)\n\nOperators Stp and S\u00b1 are integrals of motion. So the spin projection operator S\u03030 that has eigenfunctions (3.30)\nand eigenvalues \u03b60 = \u00b11 is a linear combination of these operators.

However, the system of wave functions\nis orthonormalized to the condition \"one particle in the unit volume.\" In this sense wave functions (3.21) minimize\nthe uncertainty relation which is due to (4.19)\nh(S1 \u2212 hS1 i)2 ih(S2 \u2212 hS2 i)2 i =\n\n1\nhS3 i2 .\n4\n\n(4.28)\n\nTherefore, these wave functions describe spin-coherent states of the neutrino (on properties of coherent states see, for\nexample, [40]). The given system of spin-coherent states is parametrized by four-vector S0\u03bc (q).\nV.\n\nQUASICLASSICAL INTERPRETATION\n\nLet us discuss in more detail the physical meaning of spin-coherent states of the neutrino. For this purpose we\nconstruct vector and axial currents with the help of (3.21). The vector current is\njV\u03bc = \u03a8\u0304 (x)\u03b3 \u03bc \u03a8 (x) = q \u03bc /q 0 ,\n\n(5.1)\n\nand we see that (3.21) describes neutrino propagation with the constant velocity vgr = q/q 0 . The axial current is\n\u03bc\njA\n= \u03a8\u0304 (x)\u03b3 5 \u03b3 \u03bc \u03a8 (x) = \u03b60\n\nm \u03bc\nS .\nq0\n\n(5.2)\n\nHere\n\u0002\n\u0003\n1\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\nS \u03bc = \u2212Stp\n(q)(S0 (q)Stp (q)) + S0\u03bc (q) + Stp\n(q)(S0 (q)Stp (q)) cos 2\u03b8 \u2212 e\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03bb q\u03bd S0\u03c1 (q)Stp\u03bb (q) sin 2\u03b8,\nm\n\n(5.3)\n\n\f13\nwhere \u03b8 is determined by (4.22). As expected (see (3.5) and (3.6)), vector and axial currents coincide with the\nsolutions of the BMT equation, if the proper time is defined as in (3.19).\nThe three-vector of spin \u03b6 can be expressed in terms of the four-vector S \u03bc components as\n\u03b6 = S\u2212\n\nqS 0\n.\nq0 + m\n\n(5.4)\n\nThen for \u03b6 we have\n\u03b6 = \u03b6 tp (\u03b6 0 * \u03b6 tp ) + [\u03b6 0 \u2212 \u03b6 tp (\u03b6 0 * \u03b6 tp )] cos 2\u03b8 \u2212 [\u03b6 tp \u00d7 \u03b6 0 ] sin 2\u03b8.\n\n(5.5)\n\nExpression (5.5) has a simple quasiclassical interpretation.\nThe antisymmetric tensor G\u03bc\u03bd (see equation (3.4)) can be written in the standard form\nG\u03bc\u03bd = (\u03bc0 P, \u03bc0 M ),\n\n(5.6)\n\nwhere\nM = (f 0 q \u2212 q 0 f )/(2\u03bc0 m),\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\nP = \u2212 q \u00d7 f /(2\u03bc0 m).\n\n(5.7)\n\nVectors P and M are analogous to the polarization and the magnetization vectors of medium. Note that the substitution F \u03bc\u03bd \u21d2 F \u03bc\u03bd + G\u03bc\u03bd /\u03bc0 implies that the magnetic H and electric D fields are shifted by the vectors M and P,\nrespectively (we use here notation common in electrodynamics of continuous media [41])\nH \u21d2 B = H + M,\n\nD \u21d2 E = D \u2212 P.\n\n(5.8)\n\nThus restriction (1.9) in the explicit form is\n(E * f ) = 0,\n\nEf 0 \u2212 [B \u00d7 f ] = 0.\n\n(5.9)\n\nThis means that the Lorentz force and moment of force acting on matter are equal to zero, i.e. matter is at equilibrium\nstate within the accuracy of our consideration. In particular, the vector of polarization of matter is parallel to the\nmagnetic field if the matter is at rest.\nIn the rest frame of the particle, equation (3.3) can be written in the form\n\u0003\n\u0002\n(5.10)\n\u03b6\u0307 = 2\u03bc0 \u03b6 \u00d7 B0 ,\n\nwhere the spin vector \u03b6 is related to four-vector S \u03bc by equation (5.4) and the value B0 is the effective magnetic field\nin the neutrino rest frame. This field can be expressed in terms of quantities determined in the laboratory frame,\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0002\n\u0003 q(q * B)\n1 0\nq B\u2212 q\u00d7E \u2212 0\nB0 =\nm\nq +m\n(5.11)\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0002\n\u0003\nq(q * H)\nf\n(q * f ) \u0011\nq \u0010 0\n1 0\nq H\u2212 q\u00d7D \u2212 0\n\u2212\nf \u2212 0\n.\n+\n=\nm\nq +m\n2\u03bc0\nq +m\n2\u03bc0\nWe see that the neutrino spin precesses around the direction B0 with the frequency \u03c9 = 2m|B0 |/q 0 , the angle between\nB0 and the vector of spin being \u03b8 = arccos(\u03b6 0 * \u03b6 tp ). The spin vector direction corresponding to stationary states \u03b6 tp\nis connected to the effective magnetic field as follows:\n\u03b6 tp =\n\nB0\n.\n|B0 |\n\n(5.12)\n\n\u03bc\nThis fact explains in a simple way the stationarity of states with S0\u03bc (q) = Stp\n(q).\nLet us introduce a flight length L and a spin oscillation length Losc of the particle, remember that these are related\nby \u03b8 = \u03c0L/Losc and that the scalar product (N x) = \u03c4 may be interpreted as the proper time of a particle. The spin\noscillation length is\n\n2\u03c0|q|\n.\nLosc = p\n2\n2\n2\n(f q) \u2212 f m \u2212 4mH \u03bc\u03bd f\u03bc q\u03bd + 4H \u03bc\u03b1 H\u03b1\u03bd q\u03bc q \u03bd\n\n(5.13)\n\n\f14\nWe can now write the probability for the neutrino which was arisen with polarization \u03b6 0 to change the polarization\nto \u2212\u03b6 0 after traveling some distance L. This is\nW = sin2 \u03b8 sin2 (\u03c0L/Losc ).\n\n(5.14)\n\nIt is clear that when (\u03b6 0 * \u03b6 tp ) = 0 or \u03b8 = \u03c0/2, the probability can be equal to unity and the resonance takes place.\nIf the neutrino has the fixed helicity in the initial state\n1 \b\nq\nS0\u03bc (q) =\n|q|, q 0 q/|q| , \u03b6 0 =\n,\n(5.15)\nm\n|q|\n\nthen sin2 \u03b8 = 1 \u2212 (B0 * q)2 /|B0 |2 |q|2 and formula (5.14) simplifies to the result widely discussed in the literature. This\nfact is not surprising. As was mentioned in Introduction, the Schr\u00f6dinger-type equation with an effective Hamiltonian,\nwhich was used in papers [6] for obtaining this result, is merely the BMT equation in the spinor representation.\nVI.\n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nLet us compare our results with those of the standard quantum-mechanical approach to this problem. Since the\nneutrino behavior in dense matter under the influence of magnetic field, to the best of our knowledge, was not\ninvestigated before, we consider the neutrino propagation in a constant homogeneous magnetic field alone.\nIn the studies of the influence of a stationary pure magnetic field on the neutrino spin rotation in the pioneer paper\n[15], as well as in other papers, the stationary solutions \u03a8p\u03b6 (x) first found in [42] were used as the wave functions of\na particle. These solutions are the eigenfunctions of the canonical momentum operator p\u03bc and of the spin projection\noperator Stp (see (4.12)). The description of the neutrino spin rotation there is based on solving the Cauchy problem\nwhere the initial condition is chosen in such a way that the mean value of neutrino helicity is equal to \u00b11. It was taken\nfor granted that the solution of the Cauchy problem can be expressed as a linear combination of the above-mentioned\nwave functions:\nX\n\u03a8 (x) =\nc\u03b6 (p)\u03a8p\u03b6 (x).\n(6.1)\n\u03b6=\u00b11\n\nHowever, such an assumption is incorrect. The point is that, once in a pure state the mean value of some spin operator\nis equal to \u00b11, then this state is described by an eigenfunction of this operator. In the general case, the construction\nof the eigenfunction of the spin projection operator as a superposition of only positive-energy solutions of equation\n(1.3) is possible only when this spin projection operator commutes with the operator of the sign of the energy. The\nstandard helicity operator (\u03a3 * p)/|p| does not feature it.\nThe given phenomenon is a sort of the famous Klein paradox [43]. To avoid the indicated difficulties, in relativistic\nquantum mechanics only self-adjoint operators in the subspace of wave functions with a fixed energy sign can be\ntreated as operators of observables. The choice of integrals of motion as operators of observables is the necessary\ncondition to satisfy this requirement [24].\nIn the case considered the canonical momentum operator is an integral of motion. However, the conserved operator\nof the spin projection which should set initial conditions to the Cauchy problem is uniquely - up to the sign -\ndetermined by the form of the Dirac\u2013Pauli equation. This operator is Stp . Therefore, it is impossible to construct\na wave function describing a neutrino with rotating spin in the form of an eigenfunction of the canonical momentum\noperator for its arbitrary eigenvalues. The solutions similar to (6.1) can exist when the special values of the canonical\nmomentum are chosen. So, if a neutrino moves parallel or perpendicular to a constant homogeneous magnetic field,\neigenfunctions of the helicity operator are the superpositions of positive-energy solutions alone [44].\nTo solve the problem we abandon the view that eigenvalues of the canonical momentum operator always impose\na direction of the particle propagation. We found a self-adjoint operator p\u03bc which can be interpreted as kinetic\nmomentum operator of the particle and obtained the complete orthonormal system of the solutions of equation (1.3)\nwith elements which are eigenfunctions of the given operator. On the base of this system we constructed solutions\ndescribing the neutrino with rotating spin. So our results enable one to treat a possible effect of the neutrino\npolarization change as a real precession of the particle spin.\nConsequently, the problem of neutrino spin rotation in dense matter and in strong electromagnetic fields is solved in\nfull agreement with the basic principles of quantum mechanics. Using the wave functions of orthonormal basis (3.24)\nor spin-coherent wave functions (3.21), it is possible to calculate probabilities of various processes with the neutrino\nin the framework of the Furry picture. When choosing one or another type of the basis, it is necessary to take into\naccount that, due to the time-energy uncertainty, stationary states of the neutrino can be generated only when the\nlinear size of the area occupied by the electromagnetic field and the matter is comparable in the order of magnitude\nwith the formation length of the process - the spin oscillation length in our case.\n\n\f15\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors are grateful to V.

When weak interaction with background fermions is considered to be coherent, the behavior of\nmass states of any one-half spin lepton should be described by the Dirac-type equation,\n(i\u03b3 \u03bc \u2202\u03bc + Vem + Vmatter \u2212 m) \u03a8 (x) = 0.\n\n(A1)\n\nIn this equation the term Vem describes interaction of the particle with the electromagnetic field and the term Vmatter\nis responsible for weak interaction with matter.\nFollowing paper [45], the nature of the interaction terms is determined by the restrictions that the equation be\nLorentz covariant and gauge invariant; that the terms are linear in the electromagnetic fields and integral characteristics of matter, i.e. currents and polarizations of background particles; that terms do not vanish in the limit of\nvanishing momentum of the particle; that the charge and current distribution associated with the particle be sufficiently localized that its interaction with slowly varying electromagnetic fields and characteristics of matter may be\nexpressed in terms of the electromagnetic and matter potentials and arbitrary high derivatives of these potentials\nevaluated at the position of the particle. These assumptions lead to the term Vem in the form\nVem = \u2212\n\n\u221e \u0014\nX\n\nn=0\n\n\u0015\ni\n1\n\u03b5n \u03b3 \u03bc \u0003n A\u03bc + \u03bcn \u03c3 \u03bc\u03bd \u0003n F\u03bc\u03bd + \u03bc\u2032n \u03b3 5 (\u03b3 \u03bc \u0003 \u2212 \u03b3 \u03bd \u2202\u03bd \u2202 \u03bc )\u0003n A\u03bc + \u03b5\u2032n \u03b3 5 \u03c3 \u03bc\u03bd \u0003n F\u03bc\u03bd .\n2\n2\n\n(A2)\n\nHere A\u03bc is the potential of the external electromagnetic field, F \u03bc\u03bd = \u2202 \u03bc A\u03bd \u2212 \u2202 \u03bd A\u03bc is the electromagnetic field tensor,\n\u0003 = \u2202 \u03bc \u2202\u03bc is the d'Alembert operator. The constants \u03bcn , \u03bc\u2032n , \u03b5n , \u03b5\u2032n characterize the interaction, \u03b50 is charge of the\nparticle, \u03bc0 , \u03b5\u20320 are, respectively, anomalous magnetic and electric moments, and \u03bc\u20320 is an anapole moment. The\nexpression for the Vmatter can be found if we replace A\u03bc in (A2) with a linear combination of the currents (1.1) and\nof the polarizations (1.2) of background fermions f with the proper choice of coupling constants.\nWe have the minimal nontrivial generalization of the Dirac\u2013Pauli equation neglecting terms with derivatives higher\nthan the second in (A2). In the expression for Vmatter we must hold only leading terms due to the proportionality of\n\u0003A\u03bc to the sum of charged particle currents. Further restrictions for (A1) depend on the sort of lepton and on the\nmodel of interaction. The neutrino is a neutral particle, thus \u03b50 = 0. In the framework of the standard model where\nit is assumed that the theory is T invariant and the neutrino interacts with leptons and quarks through left currents,\nits anomalous electric moment goes to zero (\u03b5\u2032 0 = 0) and the term describing direct interaction of the neutrino with\nthe currents contains multiplier (1 + \u03b3 5 ).
