In particular,\nband theory predicts that CNT are either metallic or\nsemiconducting depending on chirality, i.e. in which\ndirection a graphite monolayer is \"rolled up\" into a cylinder forming the tube [2]. Probing CNT with a scanning\ntunneling microscope, this metallic or semiconducting\nbehaviour could be tested experimentally [3, 4]. In\naddition, CNT can sustain large mechanical strains and\ncan be deformed elastically up to bendings of order 19\u25e6\nwhich corresponds to a strain along the tube of 5.5% [5].\nExperiments and numerical calculations indicate a large\nYoung modulus of order 1TPa [6]. The interaction of\nmechanical and electronic properties has been studied at\nroom temperature in two experiments [5, 7] where it has\nbeen shown that uniaxial stress can change dramatically\nthe electronic structure of CNT. In these experiments\nCNT have been suspended between two metal electrodes\non SiO2 /Si substrates. To apply uniaxial stress along\nthe tube the tip of an atomic force microscope (AFM)\nwas used. The tip was lowered to push at the center of\nthe CNT. The AFM allows to measure simultaneously\nthe deflection and the conductance\nof the \u0003CNT. The\n\u0002\u221a\nstrain can be defined as \u03c3 =\n4\u03b4 2 + l2 \u2212 l /l where l\nis the suspended length of the tube and \u03b4 is its vertical\ndeflection. In the first experiment [5] it was shown that\nchanging the strain from 0% to 3.2% let the conductance\nof a metallic CNT drop by two orders of magnitude.\nBoth the mechanical and the electronic properties were\nobserved to be completely reversible. More recently\nit was demonstrated [7] that not only metallic CNT\nbecome less conducting when applying stress but also\ninversely that some samples modified their behaviour\nfrom semiconducting to metallic. These experiments\nshow convincingly that uniaxial stress applied to CNT\nchanges their electronic properties.\nTheoretically, the effect of strain on the electronic\nproperties of CNT has been studied in band structure\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: t.gloor@epfl.ch\n\ncalculations, either analytically, using a tight\u2013binding\napproach, or numerically by density functional theory\n[8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. In particular it has been shown\nthat, depending on chirality, uniaxial stress can increase,\ndecrease or not alter the band gap.\nIn this paper we include the effect of electron\u2013electron\ncorrelations in these calculations.\nWe compute in\ndetail the gap as a function of applied strain and we\ncompare our results to the one\u2013electron band structure\ncalculations in the literature. The calculations are\ncarried out within a Hubbard tight\u2013binding model using\nthe self\u2013consistent Hartree\u2013Fock (H\u2013F) approximation.\nIt has been argued by the authors [14] that the charge\ngap of CNT at half-filling is well described within this\napproximation.\nIn this work we consider single\u2013walled CNT at half\u2013\nfilling. In a first approximation, single walled CNT can\nbe thought to be a rectangular graphite monolayer with\nthe appropriate boundary conditions (fig. 1). They can\nbe classified by their chirality vector Ch = na1 + ma2 ,\nwhere a1 and a2 are the basis vector of the honeycomb\nlattice, while n and m are integers with m \u2264 n [2]. Ch determines into which direction the graphene layer is rolled\nup. We model CNT with a Hubbard model with nearest\nneighbour hopping between \u03c0 orbitals only, and on\u2013site\ninteraction at half\u2013filling:\n\u0011\nX\nX \u0010 \u2020\nni\u2191 ni\u2193\n(1)\ntij ci\u03c3 cj\u03c3 + h.c. + U\nH=\nhi,ji\u03c3\n\ni\n\n\u03c3 is the spin index and i, j sum over the sites of a\nrectangular honeycomb lattice with periodic boundary\nconditions. c\u2020i\u03c3 (ci\u03c3 ) are the fermion creation (annihilation) operators and ni\u03c3 = c\u2020i\u03c3 ci\u03c3 . The hopping integrals\ntij are restricted to nearest neighbors and in general\nthey can have different values in every hopping direction,\nsay t\u22a5 , t1k and t2k (cf fig. 1). These three hopping\namplitudes and the one\u2013site interaction strength U are\nthe four parameters entering into the model. Choosing\nsome values for those parameters we can determine the\ncharge gap through a H\u2013F calculation for a given (n, m)\n\n\f2\n\nt\u22a5\nt1k\nT\n\nt2k\n\na1\na2\n\n\u03b8\nCh\n\nFIG. 1: A rectangular honeycomb lattice of a (4, 2) CNT, i.e.\nCh =\n\u221a 4a1 + 2a2 . The basis\n\u221a vectors are chosen to be a1 =\na/2( 3, 1) and a2 = a/2( 3, \u22121). a = 2.49\u00c5 is the lattice\nconstant for CNT.

All the details of the H\u2013F approximation can be\nfound in reference [14] where also its validity has been\ndiscussed.\nIf there is no applied strain we set in our calculation\nall the hopping amplitudes equal to a certain value\nt0 . This is of course only an approximation. Forming\na CNT from a graphite sheet, where this is true, we\nchange the hopping integrals due to effects of curvature.\nIt has been shown [10, 15] that there is a curvature\ninduced gap due to \u03c3\u2013\u03c0 hybridization for all CNT\nexcept armchair CNT. This gap is at least of order 10\nmeV. Thus armchair CNT are the only CNT where\nband structure calculations predict a metallic gapless\nbehaviour. They correspond to chiralities with n = m\nor equivalently to a chiral angle \u03b8 = \u03c0/6 (cf fig. 1). For\narmchair CNT the curvature induces only two different\nhopping amplitudes, namely t\u22a5 and tk \u2261 t1k = t2k . Due\nto this symmetry, no gap is opened from the band point\nof view. However we will show that there will be a gap\ninduced from electron\u2013electron correlation effects for all\nCNT, even if they are of armchair type. We concentrate\nour discussion on armchair CNT. The same effects are\napparent in CNT of other chiralities but in that case\nthese effects are less visible as there is already a gap in\nthe one\u2013electron band structure.\nFollowing references [8, 9] we use Harrison's phenomenological law to relate the hopping parameter t0 of the\nundeformed CNT to the ones of the elastically deformed\n2\nCNT [16] ti = t0 (ri\u2032 /ri ) where ri\u2032 and ri respectively,\nare the bond vectors before and after the deformation\nand i =\u22a5, 1k , 2k . Projecting these vectors along the\ndirections of T and Ch , we can write for an elastic\n\u2032\nuniaxial strain along the tube: riT = (1 + \u03c3)riT\nand\n\n\u2032\nriCh = (1 \u2212 \u03bd\u03c3)riC\nwhere \u03bd is the Poisson ratio. t0 can\nh\nbe estimated from ab initio calculations to be 2.4 eV [17]\nand the Poisson ratio has been computed numerically [1]\nand measured experimentally for graphite to be about\n\u03bd = 0.2 [18]. It is difficult to get an estimate for the\non\u2013site repulsion U of atomic carbon. In the literature\nvalues between 5 and 12 eV are suggested [19, 20, 21].\n\nTo study now the correlation effects in the situation\ndescribed above, i.e. stretching the tube by application\nof uniaxial strain, we rely as in previous work [14] on the\nH\u2013F approximation. Based on the observation that the\nH\u2013F calculations reproduce correctly the functional dependence of the energy gap in the one\u2013dimensional Hubbard model at half\u2013filling, we believe that it gives also\nreliable results for the gap of CNT.\nWe have shown in Ref. [14] that the H\u2013F calculations\nfor the charge gap of armchair CNT give the following\nscaling law\n\b\nHF\nEg /tk = c/n exp \u2212\u03b1n(tk /U \u2212 tk /Ucr\n)\n(2)\nHF\nwith c = 1.01, \u03b1 = 5.44 and Ucr\n= 2.23t0 , the critical\nvalue to open a gap in the two\u2013dimensional honeycomb\nlattice. Since graphite is a semi\u2013metal U is expected\nHF\nto be smaller, but close to this value, i.e. U . Ucr\n.\nFor such values a correlation gap of order 10 meV is\npresent for CNT of small diameter. We found that the\nscaling law (2) is still valid when a uniaxial stress \u03c3 is\napplied, which produces a change of the ratio t\u22a5 /tk in\nthe hamiltonian (1) from 1 to larger values. t\u22a5 /tk and\n\u03c3 are related by Harrison's formula in a non\u2013linear way.\nThe prefactor c depends only slightly on the change in\nHF\nt\u22a5 /tk . The variation of \u03b1 and Ucr\non the applied strain\nis much more significant and it is shown in figure 2. We\nHF\nobserve that Ucr\nincreases with applied strain. From\nequation (2) we can see that this would imply that the\ncharge gap diminishes since a U far from the critical\nvalue disfavours a large gap. However the simultaneous\ndecrease of the parameter \u03b1 overcomes this tendency\nand when both effects are taken into account, the charge\ngap increases approximately linearly with the strain\nHF\nwith a slope that depends on U . Note that Ucr\n> 0\nindicates that there is a metal\u2013insulator transition at a\nHF\n. This is due to the fact that the\nfinite value U = Ucr\ndensity of states in the honeycomb lattice is vanishing\nat the two Fermi points as \u03c1(\u01eb) \u221d |\u01eb|. In the limit\nt\u22a5 /tk \u2192 0 we get the one\u2013dimensional behaviour where\nany infinitesimal electron\u2013electron interaction can open\na gap. The other limiting point is t\u22a5 /tk = 2 where\nthe two Fermi points collapse into one and a band gap\nappears for values t\u22a5 /tk > 2 which makes the system\ninsulating already for U = 0.\n\nTo compare our results to experiments we plot the\nvariation of the gap for armchair CNT as a function of its\nsize when a strain of 1% is applied (cf figure 3).

As an\nexample we look at the values for a (10, 10) CNT. We can\nread off from figure 3 that the energy gap at zero strain\nis 14 meV which corresponds to a temperature of 160 K\nand that a strain of 1% induces a rise of 4 meV in the gap.\nHow does this compare to the effect of strain to the\nband structure? For small strains the following formula\nhas been derived from a tight\u2013binding calculation [8]:\ndEg\n= sgn (2p + 1) 3t0 (1 + \u03bd) cos 3\u03b8\nd\u03c3\n\n(3)\n\nwhere p \u2208 {\u22121, 0, 1} is defined by the equation\nn \u2212 m = 3q + p (q is integer). This formula has been\nused to interpret the experimental results in Ref. [7]. It\nfollows from it that the change of the band gap with applied stress can be either positive or negative, depending\non the value of q, or in other words the chirality. The\nmaximum variation is achieved for zig\u2013zag CNT (chiral\nangle zero) and is about \u00b185 meV/%. The maximal\nvariation of 85 meV/% is one or even two orders of\nmagnitude larger then the variation of 4 meV/% which\nwe derived from electron\u2013electron correlation. However,\n\nFIG. 3: The variation of the correlation gap for different\n(n, n) armchair CNT is plotted when a strain of 1% is applied (U = 2t0 ). The upper plot shows the variation of the\ngap Eg (\u03c3 = 1%) \u2212 Eg (\u03c3 = 0) as a function of n. n is proportional to the tube diameter. The lower plot shows the\nsame variation as a function of the original correlation gap at\nzero applied strain Eg0 \u2261 Eg (\u03c3 = 0). Eg0 is calculated for\ndifferent armchair CNT, n = 5, . . . , 26.\n\nfor armchair CNT (\u03b8 = \u03c0/6) equation (3) and ab initio\ncalculations predict that no gap opens up with applied\nstrain. Then correlation effects are the only reason\nwhy one should have a gap and this gap increases by\napplying uniaxial strain at a rate of several meV/%. In\nour previous example of the (10, 10) CNT, we have seen\nthat one percent of strain can change the correlation\ngap by about 30% of its original value.\nTo summarize, for semiconducting CNT with large\nband gaps the electronic structure at half filling is well\ndescribed within band theory and correlation effects give\nonly small corrections. But for CNT with a small gap\n(of order meV) correlation effects cannot be neglected.\nThis is especially true for armchair CNT where no band\ngap at all is predicted but they should develop a measurable gap, induced from correlations alone, if sufficient\npressure is applied. This conclusion is illustrated in fig.\n4. We plot the strain which is necessary to open a gap\nof Eg = 50 meV as a function of the on\u2013site repulsion\nU for a (10, 10) armchair CNT. We see that if U is not\ntoo far from Ucr this quite large gap would be realisable\nexperimentally and could be seen in low temperature\nexperiments.\n\n\f4\n0.4\n\n0.3\nE = 50 meV\n\u03c3\n\nmin\n\ng\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0\n1.5\n\n2\nU/t||\n\n2.5\n\nFIG. 4: Minimal strain \u03c3min necessary to open a gap of\n50 meV as a function of the on\u2013site repulsion U .
