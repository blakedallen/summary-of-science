A.\nAl-Mustansiriyah University, College of science, Dept. of physics, Iraq\nABSTRACT\nThe Simulation of Cherenkov light lateral distribution function (LDF) from\nparticles of Extensive Air Showers (EAS) with ultra high energy cosmic rays\n( E \u2265 1016 eV ) was simulated for primary protons by the computer code\nCORSIKA. The parameterization, that constructed on the basis of this\nsimulation have allowed us to reconstruct the events, that is, to reconstruct\nthe type and energy of the particle that generated EAS from signal\namplitudes of Cherenkov light registered with the Tunka-25 facility. The\nextrapolation of the Cherenkov light LDF approximation at the energy range\n(1016 \u2212 2 \u22c5 1018 eV ) was taken into account.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe determination of the energy spectrum and mass composition of the\nultrahigh energy cosmic rays (E>1016 eV) is one of the greatest challenges in\ncosmic ray measurements. Using the atmosphere as a large target, Detectors\nare capable of tracing the development of the size of the Extensive Air\nShower (EAS) through the atmosphere [1, 2]. Large-scale experiments, like\nthe Yakutsk EAS array [3], AGASA [4] HiRes [5], Pierre Auger\nObservatory [6] and Tunka-133 [7] focus on the precise determination of the\nenergy spectrum, mass composition and arrival direction distribution of\nultrahigh-energy cosmic rays. The analysis of the characteristics of the\ndetected longitudinal profiles is currently the most reliable way for\nextracting some information about the primary cosmic ray mass\ncomposition. One of the main techniques for observing EAS is effectively\ninvestigated by the method of Cherenkov light EAS registration [8, 9]. The\n\n\fmain tools for calculating of EAS characteristics and experimental data\nanalyzing (Direction of the shower axis, determination of the primary\nparticle energy and type from the characteristics of Cherenkov radiation of\nsecondary charged particles) are codes of numerical simulation by the Monte\nCarlo method. Reconstruction of the primary particle characteristics\ninitiating the atmospheric cascade from Cherenkov radiation of secondary\nparticles at the energy ranges (1016-1018) eV calls for the creation of a library\nof shower patterns, when this requires much computation time.\nIn the present work, the CORSIKA software package [10] in which hadron\ninteractions are simulated using the QGSJET [11] and GHEISHA codes [12]\nsimulates lateral distributions of Cherenkov light emitted by atmospheric\ncascades initiated by primary high-energy cosmic ray protons and nuclei.\nSimulation of Cherenkov radiation using the CORSIKA code requires very\nlong computation time for a single shower with energy of 1018 eV for a\nprocessor with a frequency of a few GHz. Therefore, the development of\nfast modeling algorithms and the search for approximations of the results of\nnumerical modeling are important practical problems.\nParameterization of the lateral distribution function (LDF) of Cherenkov\nradiation versus the distance R from the EAS axis and the primary particle\nenergy E that can be used to approximate the results of numerical simulation\nof LDFs of Cherenkov photons emitted by EAS initiated in the Earth's\natmosphere by the cosmic ray particle having a very high energy was taken.\nIn the present work, we use this parameterization to describe results of\nnumerical simulation of EAS by the CORSIKA code and of Cherenkov light\nemitted by EAS measured with the Tunka-25 facility [13].\n\nTHE CHERENKOV LIGHT LDF APPROXIMATION\nThe simulation of the Cherenkov light LDF in EAS is obtained using\nCORSIKA code for primary protons at the highest energies ( E \u2265 1016 ) eV.\nFor parameterization of simulated Cherenkov light LDF, we used the\nproposed function as a function of the distance R, from the shower axis and\nthe energy Eo of the initial primary particle, which depends on four\nparameters a, \u03b3 , \u03c3 and ro [14, 15]:\n\n\fC\u03c3 ea e xp(R / \u03b3 + ( R \u2212 r0 ) / \u03b3 + ( R / \u03b3 ) 2 + ( R \u2212 r0 ) 2 /\u03b3 2 ) \u22122\n(1)\nQ( E, R) =\nm ,\n\u03b3 ( R / \u03b3 ) 2 + ( R \u2212 r0 ) 2 / \u03b3 2 + R\u03c3 2 / \u03b3\nwhere C=103 m-1; R is the distance from the shower axis; a, \u03b3, \u03c3 and ro are\nparameters of Cherenkov light LDF. The energy dependences of the\nparameters , \u03b3, \u03c3 and ro is shown on Fig.1 for primary proton.\n\n[\n\n]\n\nFigure 1. The fit parameters a, \u03b3, \u03c3 and ro as a function of the primary energy of the\ninitiating primary proton for vertical EAS.\n\nThe simulated data and the approximated formula (Eq.(1)) for vertical\nshowers are presented on Fig. 2. for primary protons at the energies 1016,\n2*1016 and 5*1016 eV. In Fig. 3. one can see the extrapolation of the\nCherenkov light LDF parameterization of the obtained data with CORSIKA\nprogram at the energies 1017, 2*1017, 5*1017, 1018 and 2*1018 eV. The accuracy\nof the Cherenkov light LDF approximation for vertical showers for primary\nprotons is better than 15 % at the distances 80-120m from the shower axis,\nand close to 5 % for the other distances.\n\n\fFigure 2. Lateral distribution of Cherenkov light which simulated with CORSIKA code\n(solid lines) and one calculated (Eq. (1)) (dashed lines) for vertical showers initiated by\nprimary protons at 1016, 2 *1016 and 5 *1016 eV.\n\nFigure 3. Extrapolation of the Cherenkov light LDF parameterization at energies 1017,\n2 *1017, 5 *1017, 1018 and 2*\n2 1018 eV with the help of Eq.(1).\n\n\fCONCLUSION\n\nOn the basis of simulated events for primary protons with CORSIKA code is\nobtained the lateral distribution function of atmospheric Cherenkov light in\nextensive air showers for configuration of the Tunka-25 EAS array at the\nhighest energies E \u22651016 eV. Using results of this simulation we obtained the\nparameters of lateral distribution function of the Cherenkov radiation as a\nfunctions of the primary energy for primary protons. The extrapolation of\nthe Cherenkov light LDF parameterization of the obtained data with\nCORSIKA program at the energy range 1016- 2*1018 eV is obtained.\nThe main advantage of the given approach consists of the possibility to\nmake a library of LDF samples which could be utilized for analysis of real\nevents which detected with the ultrahigh energy EAS arraies and\nreconstruction of the primary cosmic rays energy spectrum and mass\ncomposition.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Engel R.
