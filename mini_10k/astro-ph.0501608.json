Stars: individual: EK Dra, activity, fundamental parameters, binary: spectroscopic and visual\n\n1. Introduction\nEK Dra (GJ 559.1A, HD 129333) is a star that has roughly\nthe mass of the Sun. The Henry Draper Catalogue and\nExtension (Cannon & Pickering 1918-1994) and Simbad\ndatabase list a spectral type of F8 for this star. The equivalent width of Li I is about 0.2 \u00c5, and therefore it must\nbe relatively young. Fr\u00f6hlich et al. (2002) and references\ntherein discuss the age and activity connection.\nVarious studies of EK Dra at different wavelength\nregimes have been carried out including longterm photometric monitoring over decades. Dorren & Guinan (1994)\nhave observed strong variable chromospheric emission\nlines in their UV spectra. The star has the highest known\nCa II H and K emission level of any known early G-type\nstar which is not a close binary (Soderblom 1985).\nThe star is rapidly rotating (v sin i = 16.5 \u00b1 1.0 km/s)\nand has dominant spot features at \u223c 70\u25e6 \u2212 80\u25e6 that\nSend offprint requests to: Brigitte K\u00f6nig, e-mail:\nbkoenig@bruno.phyast.pitt.edu\n\u2217 Partly based on observations collected at the GermanSpanish Astronomical Center, Calar Alto, operated jointly\nby the Max-Planck Institut f\u00fcr Astronomie and the Instituto\nde Astrof\u0131\u0301sica de Andaluc\u0131\u0301a (CSIC), and partly based on\nobservations taken with the 2-m-Alfred Jensch telescope of\nthe Th\u00fcringer Landessternwarte Tautenburg.\n\ncould also be the offshoot of a large polar spot. These\nspots are located at a higher latitude than typical spots\non the Sun (Strassmeier & Rice 1998). Strassmeier &\nRice (1998) measure several rotation periods between\n2.599 \u00b1 0.001 days and 2.796 \u00b1 0.026 days using different\nmethods where for their purpose they adopt a longterm\nphotometric period of 2.605 days. Coronal emission was\nalso observed in X-rays and as well in the radio regime.\nThe X-ray light curve is significantly variable, with the\nemission from the cooler plasma being strongly modulated\nby the rotation period, while the emission from the hotter\nplasma is only weakly variable (Guedel et al. 1995).\nA 12 to 14 year cyclic variability was discovered by\nDorren & Guinan (1994) and Dorren et al. (1995) using\nphotometric and spectroscopic data. They observed that\nthe Ca II H & K emission index increased during that time.\nA decline of brightness since 1994 was noted by Fr\u00f6hlich\nel al. (2002). The star became fainter as its mean level of\nchromospheric activity rose. These findings can be interpreted as signs of a spot cycle.\nEK Dra also is a long period binary star where the\nsecondary is much fainter than the primary. Duquennoy\n& Mayor (1991) used a period of 11.5 years in order to\nderive the first preliminary spectroscopic orbit. However,\n\n\f2\n\nB. K\u00f6nig et al.: The young active binary star EK Draconis\u2217\n\nas will be discussed in the next section, the true period is\n45 \u00b1 5 years.\nEK Dra is a well-studied young, active and nearby star.\nIt thus serves as one of the best-studied young stars evolving similar to the Sun. Since it is a long period binary, it is\npossibly one of the few cases of young stars for which the\ntrue masses can be determined. The aim of this paper is to\nderive the true mass, and to calculate a new atmospheric\nmodel. These will then allow us to compare the properties of this object with evolutionary tracks. Additionally,\nwe have obtained a large number of radial velocity measurements which will give us new insights into the stellar\nactivity and the influence of stellar activity on precise radial velocity measurements.\n\n2. Deriving the true masses of EK Dra A and\nEK Dra B\nBy combining the data from our speckle interferometry\nand RV data from the literature with our own RV measurements, it is for the first time possible to derive the\ntrue masses of EK Dra A and EK Dra B.\n\n2.1. Speckle interferometry : observations\nEK Dra was repeatedly observed with the 3.5 m-telescope\non Calar Alto from 1991 to 2002 using speckle interferometry, mostly in the K band (\u03bb = 2.2 \u03bcm). An overview\nof these observations is given in Table 1 and is displayed\nin Fig. 1. Observations 1 and 2 made use of a device for\none-dimensional speckle interferometry. For these observations, the technique of data acquisition and reduction\nhas been described by Leinert & Haas (1989). All other\ndata points were obtained using the near-infrared cameras\nMAGIC and OMEGA Cass that are capable of taking sequences of short exposures (typically \u03c4 \u2248 0.1 s), and thus\nallow speckle interferometry with two-dimensional detector arrays. Details of data reduction and analysis have\nbeen described by K\u00f6hler et al. (2000). Briefly, 1000\u22121500\nshort exposures (\"frames\") are taken for EK Dra and the\nnearby point source (PSF calibrator) BS 5436. BS 5436\nis an F4IV star at a distance of 31.5 pc which implies\nthat its relative size is \u2264 0.3 mas, and thus it is considerably smaller than the resolution of 1.22\u03bb/D = 160 mas\nof the 3.5-m-telescope in the K-band. In Fourier space\nthis reduces to \u03bb/D = 130 mas. These images are stored\nin \"data cubes\" of 250 frames. The telescope position is\nswitched between object and PSF calibrator after each\ndata cube to observe both under nearly identical atmospheric conditions. After background subtraction, flatfielding and correcting for bad pixels, the data cubes are\nFourier transformed. The modulus of the complex visibility is derived by deconvolving the power spectrum of\nthe object with that of the PSF calibrator, while the\nphase is reconstructed using the Knox-Thompson algorithm (Knox & Thompson 1974) and also the bispectrum\nmethod (Lohmann et al. 1983). The complex visibility is\naveraged over all observations of EK Dra taken on one\n\nFig. 1. Orbital motion of the companion EK Dra B from\n1991 to 2002. The primary is located at (0,0). As can be deduced from Table 1., the last two points are separated by one\nyear. Primary and secondary are thus close to the apastron.\nCombined with the RV measurements we estimate a period of\nabout 45 \u00b1 5 years because Duquennoy & Mayor observed the\nRV minimum in May 1987.\n\nnight. Finally, the binary parameters \u2013 position angle,\nprojected separation and flux ratio FB /FA \u2013 are derived\nfrom a model fit to the complex visibility in Fourier space.\nExcept for the data points 1 and 2 in Table 1, for all observations the relative astrometry of the components has\nbeen put into a consistent reference frame. This reference\nframe is primarily based on astrometric fits to images of\n\n\fB. K\u00f6nig et al.: The young active binary star EK Draconis\u2217\n\n3\n\nTable 1.

(2003).\nFor this program we use the 2-m-Alfred Jensch telescope\nof the TLS, which is equipped with an \u00e9chelle spectrograph with a resolving power of \u2206\u03bb/\u03bb = 67000. During\nthe observations an iodine absorption cell is placed in the\noptical light path in front of the spectrograph slit. The\nresulting iodine absorption spectrum is then superposed\non the stellar spectrum providing a stable wavelength reference against which the stellar RV are measured. In the\nfirst step, the spectra are bias-subtracted, flat-fielded and\nextracted using standard IRAF routines.\nIn the second step the RVs are calculated by modeling the observed spectra with a high signal-to-noise ratio\ntemplate of the star (without iodine) and a scan of our\niodine cell taken at very high resolution with the Fourier\nTransform Spectrometer of the McMath-Pierce telescope\n\nFilter\nK\nK\nK\nK\nH\nK\nK\nK\nK\n\nFlux ratio\nFB /FA\n\n0.066\n0.084\n0.087\n0.084\n0.111\n0.081\n0.081\n\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\n0.003\n0.003\n0.003\n0.004\n0.006\n0.008\n0.010\n\nInstrument\n1D\n1D\nMAGIC\nMAGIC\nMAGIC\nMAGIC\nOMEGA Cass\nOMEGA Cass\nOMEGA Cass\n\nat Kitt Peak. The latter enables us to compute the relative\nvelocity shift between stellar and iodine absorption lines as\nwell as to model the temporal and spatial variations of the\ninstrumental profile; see Valenti et al. (1995) and Butler\net al. (1996) for a description of the principles behind this\ntechnique. Fig. 2 shows our RV measurements together\nwith those obtained by Duquennoy & Mayor (1991).\nRV measurements have been made at TLS since 2001\nand these show that we can achieve a routine RV precision of \u2248 3 m s\u22121 . However, our RV measurements for EK\nDra have an error of about 30 m s\u22121 . Two factors degrade\nthe RV precision of our EK Dra measurements. First, EK\nDra has a v sin i of 16.5 \u00b1 1.0 km/s. Since the RV error is\nproportional to the v sin i, the error compared to a more\nslowly rotating star with comparable S/N should be several times worse. Second, EK Dra is an active star and as\ndemonstrated by Saar & Donahue (1997) the activity can\nintroduce significant RV \"jitter\" depending on the level of\nactivity of up to several tensof m/s.\nThe relative RV measurements obtained by us were\nconverted to absolute values by measuring the absolute\nRV of the template spectrum by fitting Voigt functions to\nphotospheric lines with an equivalent width larger than\n0.1 \u00c5 in the wavelength range from 5000 to 6000 \u00c5.\n\n2.3. Deriving the masses of the two components\nThe motion of EK Dra B with respect to the primary\nfrom 1991 to 2002 is shown in Fig. 1. Although almost\nno curvature is seen, this relative motion is definitely not\ncaused by the proper motion of EK Dra A with respect to\na chance-projected background star. The proper motion of\nEK Dra A is \u03bc\u03b1 = \u2212138.6 mas/yr and \u03bc\u03b4 = \u221211.9 mas/yr\n(Hipparcos catalog), which is roughly perpendicular to the\nobserved motion and also much faster. Furthermore, the\ncompanion has significantly slowed down over the timespan covered by the observations, which can only be explained by orbital motion. The slow-down additionally implies that the last observations are close to the apastron.\nThe spectroscopic observations of Duquennoy & Mayor\n(1991) cover the periastron. By combining the radial velocity data with the speckle observation it is possible to\nderive a first orbit of the system and the true masses\n\n\f4\n\nB. K\u00f6nig et al.: The young active binary star EK Draconis\u2217\n\nFig. 3. The projected distance versus time. The projected distance was converted in to AU by using the Hipparcos distance.\nThe line shows the fit using the elements given in Table 2.\n\nFig. 5. Using the distance as measured by Hipparcos and the\nradial velocity measurements it is possible to derive the true\nmasses of both components. Shown here is the derived orbit\nusing the values given in Table 2.\nTable 2. Orbital elements\n\nFig. 4. The radial-velocity curve together with the fit using\nthe values given in in Table 2.\n\nof both components using the distance as measured by\nHipparcos. The projected distance versus time is shown\nin Fig. 3. The deceleration is clearly visible. By combining the speckle imaging data with the radial-velocity data\n(Fig. 4), we derive a period of 45 \u00b1 5 years. Given the orbital period the radial velocity (Fig. 4) constrains very well\nthe mass-ratio of the two components. By fitting an orbit\nto the speckle data (Fig. 5) combined with the information\non the projected velocity and the Hipparcos distance, we\ncan calculate the true masses of the components and all\nother orbital elements by solving the Keplerian equations\n(Kepler 1609, Kepler 1618). The orbital elements are summarized in Table 2. For the masses of the two components,\nwe find 0.9\u00b10.1 M\u2299 and 0.5\u00b10.1 M\u2299, for the primary and\nthe secondary, respectively. With e = 0.82\u00b10.03, the orbit\nis surprisingly eccentric. The distance between the stars\nis nevertheless still 2.2 AU at the periastron. It thus seem\nunlikely that the secondary has a big impact on the activity level of the primary.\n\n3.

Data reduction and analysis were carried\nout using the reduction pipeline written in IDL especially\nfor this fiber-coupled spectrograph.\nFor the spectral synthesis analysis we used the model\natmosphere code MAFAGS. For a detailed description\nof the methods see Fuhrmann et al. (1997). As described there, we deduce the effective temperature from\nthe Balmer line wings and the surface gravity from the iron\nionisation equilibrium and the wings of the Mg Ib lines.\nThe analysis is performed strictly relative to the Sun. The\nmethod for determining all stellar parameters was tested\nand compared extensively in Fuhrmann (2004).\n\n\fB. K\u00f6nig et al.: The young active binary star EK Draconis\u2217\n\n5\n\nTable 3.

The strong lithium line indicates that EK Dra is young.\n\n3.1. Results for EK Dra\nThe chromospheric activity, the variability, the presence\nof core filling-in of the H\u03b1, the calcium H & K and the\nmagnesium Ib-lines and a strong lithium absorption line\nat 6707 \u00c5 (Fig. 6) indicate that the star is indeed young\nand if we believe the star to belong to the Pleiades, we\ncan assume an age of about 125 Myr.\nThe spectral syntheses analysis we performed was challenging because it is known that the star rotates fast\n(16.5 \u00b1 1 km/s) and it exhibits huge stellar spots which\nare much cooler that the surrounding surface. Depending\non the position of the star spot, the star could appear\ncooler than it actually is. On the other hand the H\u03b1-line\ncore is filled-in up to a level of 0.5. The H\u03b2-line is not\nnoticeable filled-in. To measure the effective temperature\nwe calculate a grid of line profiles of the H\u03b1- and H\u03b2-lines\nusing the surface gravity, and iron abundance determined\nusing the Fe I & II- and Mg Ib-lines. We fit the wings\nof the strong lines but not the core. The final effective\ntemperature is measured using the H\u03b1-temperature and\ncomparing it with the H\u03b2-temperature giving a weight of\n75% to the H\u03b2-temperature. If the new derived tempera-\n\nture changed more than 50 K compared to the previously\nobtained temperature we repeat the determination of the\niron abundance as well as the surface gravity.\nIn the case of the spectrum taken on Sep. 11, 2001,\nboth temperatures were identical while in the spectrum\ntaken on May 25, 2002 the H\u03b2-line leads to a 40 K hotter\nstar. For a fit to the H\u03b1-line profile see Fig. 7. However,\nthe temperature most consistent with all measurements is\n5700 \u00b1 70 K. We have double-checked the derived effective\ntemperature with a fit to the H\u03b1 and H\u03b2 lines, assuming a\nspot temperature of 4500 K and a spot coverage of 1/4 of\nthe visible surface. The resulting measured temperature\ndoes not significantly change the previously obtained results of the one-temperature fit because the continuum of\nthe spot is only 10% of the continuum level of the surrounding stellar surface. This is because the spot is much\ncooler than the photosphere, and hence its total contribution to the light emitted from the star is very small. This\nresults in a correspondingly small contribution to the total\nspectrum. In fact, the spot only produces a little hump in\nthe photospheric line-profiles used for the Doppler imaging, which changes the EW of a photospheric line only by\na small amount, and cannot be seen in H\u03b1 and H\u03b2. Thus,\n\n\f6\n\nB. K\u00f6nig et al.: The young active binary star EK Draconis\u2217\n\nFig. 7. The H\u03b1-line together with two theoretical H\u03b1-line profiles to estimate the temperature. The real temperature is in\nbetween the plotted ones. Note the filling in of the H\u03b1-line.\n\neven for a highly spotted star, the average line spectrum\nis dominated by the photosphere.\nComparing the spectroscopic distance determined by\nus to the Hipparcos parallax, we have a 5.8% discrepancy.\nThis makes us confident that the spectral parameters we\nderived, especially the surface gravity log g, are reasonable. Regarding the H\u03b1 line depth and the line wings\n(Fig. 11, lower panel), we see significant changes of the\neffective temperature from 5700 K to 5580 K when using\nonly the H\u03b1 temperature. The H\u03b2 temperature is not that\nstrongly affected.\nThe analysis from Wyse & Gilmore (1995) lead to a\nsomewhat lower iron abundance of \u22120.214 which was estimated by narrow-band Str\u00f6mgen photometry. The temperature of EK Dra of 5930 K estimated by Dorren &\nGuinan (1994) is higher than our measured temperature of\n5700 \u00b1 70 K. But in our case the H\u03b1- and H\u03b2-line profiles\nwould not support such a high temperature in our spectrum. Eggen (1998) also estimated a metallicity of EK Dra\nof \u22120.24 dex using Str\u00f6mgen photometry, which is lower\nthan the metallicity measured by us of \u22120.16 dex.\nFor their Doppler imaging, Strassmeier & Rice (1998)\nneed stellar parameters as an input and they used Kurucz\nmodel atmospheres where they fixed the iron abundance\nto [F e/H] = 0.0 and the surface gravity to log g = 4.5 to\nderive Teff = 5870 \u00b1 50 K and v sin i = 17.3 km/s. They recover stellar spots at high latitude with a temperature difference of \u2206T = 400 K. A polar spot cannot be confirmed\nor excluded by their data. The inclination of the stellar\nrotation axis is \u223c 60\u25e6 . The inclination of the orbit thus is\n\nsignificantly different from \u223c 60\u25e6 . Because of the significant difference from our spectral parameters (especially\nthe effective temperature and the iron abundance) we propose caution when using the conclusions of the Strassmeier\n& Rice (1998) Doppler imaging.\n\n4. Space motion and age of EK Dra\nSoderblom & Clements (1987)\nestimate the age of EK Dra to be \u223c 70 Myr using activity indicators and claim that the star could have traveled from the Pleiades to the solar vicinity with a peculiar velocity of only 2 km/s. On the other hand, based\non activity indicators Wichmann et al. (2003) claim that\nthe star is even younger than the Pleiades with an age\nof \u223c 50 Myr and call it a member of the local association. Wichmann & Schmitt (2003) have traced the space\nmotion backward in time and exclude a former membership of the young associations Lupus-Centaurus-Crux or\nUpper-Centaurus-Lupus.\nStauffer et al. (1998) derived an age of the Pleiades\nof about 125 Myr using the aproproate distance scale\nand modern stellar evolution calculations. Estimates by\nBasri, Marcy & Graham (1996) using two brown dwarf\nmembers of the Pleiades give an age of 115 to 125 Myr.\nWe have used the proper motion \u03bc\u03b1 = \u2212138.61 \u00b1\n0.72 mas, \u03bc\u03b4 = \u221211.92 \u00b1 0.56 mas and the parallax \u03c0 =\n29.46 \u00b1 0.61 measured by Hipparcos, as well as the RV of\n\u221223.1 \u00b1 0.2 km/s measured by us to calculate the galactic\n\n\fB. K\u00f6nig et al.: The young active binary star EK Draconis\u2217\n\nspace motion (U/V /W ) = (1.3 \u00b1 0.3/24.8 \u00b1 0.4/ \u2212 0.3 \u00b1\n0.3) km/s).\nEK Dra is located in the vicinity of the Sun at a distance measured by Hipparcos of 33.94 \u00b1 0.72 pc. EK Dra\nis a young object and it is likely that its age lies within 50\nto 125 Myrs depending on the criteria one applies, e.g. if\none only regards the activity (50 Myr) or if one assumes\nit is a Pleiades field star (125 Myr).\nWith the average absolute brightness of the primary\nof MK = 3.4 \u00b1 0.1 mag, and of MK = 6.0 \u00b1 0.2 mag for the\nsecondary component, and using the evolutionary tracks\npublished by Baraffe et al. (1998) (Model: [M/H]=0, \u03b1 =\n1.9, Y=0.282), one derives a mass of 1.025 \u00b1 0.100 M\u2299\nand an age of 35 Myr (lower limit: 30 Myr and upper limit\n1.5 Gyr on the main sequence (MS)) for the primary. The\nmass derived from the evolutionary tracks agrees with the\ntrue mass within the errors. The companion is expected\nto be about 6 mag fainter than the primary in the V-band.\nThe visible spectrum of EK Dra is thus completely dominated by the primary.\n\n5. Activity, line asymmetry and RV variations\n\nFig. 8. Top panel the bisector analysis of the chromospheric\ninactive lines outside the region which is affected by the iodine\nlines. Lower panel the original RV data observed in the years\n2001, 2002 and 2003 at the TLS.\n\nBecause EK Dra B was close to the apastron at the\ntime of the RV observations, and since the period of this\nhighly eccentric orbit is 45 \u00b1 5 years, the influence of the\nsecondary on this section of the RV curve is negligible\n(Fig. 4). With an accuracy of our relative RV measurements of 30 m/s it is possible to study the RV variations\ncaused by stellar activity. Saar & Donahue (1997) have\nstudied the activity-induced RV variations and found a\nrelation of AS \u2248 6.5fS0.9 v sin i, where fS is the star-spot\narea coverage [fS is in %, v sin i in km/s, and AS in m/s].\n\n7\n\nFig. 9. The RV data phase folded with the period of 2.769 days\nand split between the different years of observation. The filled\nsymbols represent the asymmetric lines and the open circles\nthe symmetric lines.\n\nFig. 10. The results of the bisector analysis for all three years\nof observations. The filled squares are the data from 2001, the\ncrosses the data from 2002, and the circles from 2003. The\nspectra from 2001 mostly have asymmetric lines, whereas in\n2002 we observe asymmetric as well as symmetric lines. In 2003\nthe lines are mostly symmetric. The dashed line indicates the\nborder between the symmetric and asymmetric spectral lines.\n\nFor spots located at the equator, the filling factor is given\nby this equation. For spots located close to the pole, the\nRV variations would give a rise to a too small filling factor.\nBecause spots on the pole do not give rise to RV variations, the amplitude of the RV variations in principle just\ngive a lower limit for the filling factor fS . From the measured RV variations we thus derive (Fig. 8, upper panel)\nthe peak-to-peak amplitude variation of about 550 m/s,\n\n\f8\n\nB. K\u00f6nig et al.: The young active binary star EK Draconis\u2217\n\nFig. 11. The upper panel shows the average profile of H\u03b1 of all\nspectra where the photospheric lines are symmetric in comparison to the average profile of all spectra where the photospheric\nlines are asymmetric. The difference between the two H\u03b1 profiles is remarkably small. The only notable difference is that the\ncore of H\u03b1 is a little deeper in the case of the spectra where\nthe photospheric lines are asymmetric. The lower panel shows\nthat there are significant variations in the depth of H\u03b1. Also\nthe wings of the H\u03b1 lines show a difference and lead to a 120 K\ncooler star. This effect is smaller in H\u03b2.\n\nwhich implies that fS \u2265 5.2% due to the fact that we\nsuspect the presence of a polar spot.\nPerforming a period analysis we find a period of the\nRV variation of 2.767 \u00b1 0.005 days in the first two years of\nobservations but adding the third year the period search\nprograms do not recover the period clearly. When we inspect the data (see Fig. 9), we see that the amplitude of\nthe RV signal declines.\nMoreover, we see a change in the bisector of the spectral lines over the three years of observations. We use the\nclassical Doppler imaging lines, Fe I at 6400 \u00c5, and Ca I\nat 6439 \u00c5 to measure the amplitude of the asymmetry because they are not blended by other weaker spectral lines\nand there are no iodine lines in this part of the spectrum.\nShown in Fig. 8 (upper panel) is the average velocity difference between the lower and the upper half of the spectral lines. A negative sign means that the lower part is\nblue-shifted with respect to the upper part of the line.\nDuring the three years the behavior of the bisector significantly changed. In 2001, the velocity difference is relatively constant with a shift of 700 to 1500 m/s, whereas\nin 2003, the bisector amplitude varies between 1200 m/s\nand \u2212100 m/s. We then can split the lines between asymmetric lines with a bisector from 700 m/s to 1500 m/s and\nsymmetric lines with a bisector of 600 m/s to \u2212500 m/s\n(Fig. 10). Excluding the symmetric lines from the period analysis we recover the period over all three years.\nCompared to the amplitude of the RV signal of the sym-\n\nmetric lines, the signal for the asymmetric lines is more\npronounced (Fig. 9).\nWe can summarize our finding as follows: in 2001 and\n2002, we observe a periodic RV signal and the spectral\nlines were quite asymmetric. This RV signal is less obvious\nin the data from 2003 but can be recovered if only the\nasymmetric lines are used. Clearly, this is the signal of\nstellar spots not located at the pole; the Doppler imaging\nby Strassmeier & Rice (1998) shows the presence of spots\nclose to the equator. One possible explanation would be\nthat in 2003, there were fewer spots at mid latitudes, or\nalternatively, there were so many plage regions so that it is\ndifficult to recover the periodic RV signal from the spots.\nPlage regions are known to produce less asymmetric lines.\nIn order to find out if changes in the symmetry of the\nlines are related to the activity level, we averaged all spectra with symmetric photospheric lines and all spectra with\nasymmetric photospheric lines. Fig. 11 shows the H\u03b1-line\nprofiles of all spectra where the photospheric lines are symmetric in comparison with the average profile of all spectra where the photospheric lines are asymmetric. The difference between the two H\u03b1 profiles is remarkably small.\nHowever, we do see significant variations of the depth of\nH\u03b1. Thus testing if the amplitude of the RV signal is dependent on the depth of H\u03b1, we calculate the average RV\nof all spectra where H\u03b1 is deepest and all spectra where\nH\u03b1 is shallowest. We do not see any significant difference\nbetween the two samples, as the average RV of the first\nsample is \u221240 \u00b1 80 m/s0 , and the average of the second\n\u2212130 \u00b1 120 m/s 0 . There is also no significant difference\nin the asymmetry of the two, as the average asymmetry\nof the first sample is 860 \u00b1 380 m/s 0 and the asymmetry\nof the second sample is 1000 \u00b1 350 m/s 0 . Thus, there is\nno obvious correlation between the RV or the asymmetry\nand the depth of the H\u03b1-line. Additionally, there is only\na very weak correlation between the asymmetry and the\nRV.\nThe change of the temperature as seen in Fig. 11 (lower\npanel) of about 120 K measured by the H\u03b1-line profile is\nnot as visible in the H\u03b2-line profile. There, it only shows\na temperature change of 20 K which lies within the errors\nof this method. Giving more weight (75%) to the H\u03b2 temperature will result only in a small temperature change.\nBut of course the temperature change will also affect the\nFe I and Fe II ionisation equilibrium and this will have\nan effect on the determination of the surface gravity log g.\nWe cannot verify this here because the spectra obtained at\nTLS are mostly observed with the iodine cell in the light\npath which superposes iodine absorption lines on the part\nof the spectrum containing the necessary iron lines.\nHow can we interpret these findings? A spot that is located close to the equator would lead by its appearance to\na positive asymmetry and also to a redshift of the spectral\nline. When the spot is receding due to rotation, it would\nlead to a negative asymmetry and to a blue-shift of the\nline. In this case we would expect a clear correlation be0\n\nvariance\n\n\fB. K\u00f6nig et al.: The young active binary star EK Draconis\u2217\n\ntween the asymmetry and the RV. Such a correlation is\nfor example observed in RS CVn systems (Donati et al.\n1994). This is clearly not what we observe. The Doppler\nimaging of this star mainly shows a polar spot, and our\nestimate of the spot size from the amplitude of the RV\nvariations indicates that there are only a few spots close\nto the equator.\nIn the case of sunspots it is well known that the\nEvershed effect causes the line cores to be blue-shifted on\nthe limb-side of the penumbra and redshifted at the other\nside. The blue-shifted lines show a blue asymmetry that\nis negative, whereas the red-shifted lines show a positive\nasymmetry (Sanchez Almeida et al. 1996). While the contribution of the total light emitted is quite small, a spot\ndoes produce a hump in the profile of the photospheric\nline. Because we can measure the RV to a very high accuracy, such effects can be detected. However, observations\nof the penumbra of spots close to the disk center show\npositive as well as negative asymmetry (Balasubramaniam\n1998). Thus it is not surprising that in the case of a star\nwhere there are numerous spots close to the pole, there is\nno correlation between the RV and the asymmetry. It is\ninteresting to note that the bisector of the solar granulation shows the famous C-shape that will result in almost\nno shift between the upper half of the line and the lower\nhalf. We would call such lines symmetric. However, once\nthe convective structures are spatially resolved, the redshifted inter-granular lanes turn out to give rise to spectral\nlines with a negative asymmetry, and the granules give rise\nto lines with a slightly positive asymmetry (Guenther &\nMattig 1991).\nThus we presume that large and complicated flow patterns in the polar spots prevent us from observing a correlation between the RV and line asymmetry or depth of\nH\u03b1. Nevertheless our observations show that the periodic\nRV signal can be detected if only the lines with positive\nasymmetry \u2265 600 m/s are taken into account. This indicates that there is a link between the asymmetry and RV,\nwhich implies that both are possibly caused by spots.\nOur observations also suggest that in the case of\nEK Dra it is impossible to account for the RV signal of the\nstar spots to increase the sensitivity of a possible RV signal of an orbiting planet because the correlation of either\nthe depth of H\u03b1 or the line-asymmetry with the rotation\nphase is limited.\n\n6. Summary and conclusions\nWe have studied the young star EK Dra spectroscopically\nand have resolved the binary system by means of speckle\ninterferometry. This star is in fact a young star evolving\nanalogously to the Sun, where the analogy in the evolution\nis even closer than previously thought.\n\u2013 By combining the speckle interferometry with old and\nnew RV measurements we have for the first time a\nreliable mass estimate of EK Dra A and EK Dra B of\n0.9 \u00b1 0.1 M\u2299 and 0.5 \u00b1 0.1 M\u2299 .\n\n9\n\n\u2013 The orbit of the binary turns out to be highly eccentric\nwith e = 0.82 \u00b1 0.03. The period of the system is of\n45 \u00b1 5 years, much longer than previously thought.\n\u2013 The high resolution spectra allow us to derive a new\nTeff of 5700 \u00b1 70 K and a new value of log g of\n4.37 \u00b1 0.10. Additionally, we measured a metallicity\nof [F e/H] = \u22120.16 \u00b1 0.07. The new values thus differ\nfrom those of Strassmeier & Rice (1998), who found\nTeff = 5870 \u00b1 50 K, log g = 4.5 and the metallicity\n[F e/H] = 0.0. However, the spectroscopic distance derived using our new values now is in good agreement\nwith the Hipparcos distance.\n\u2013 The Baraffe et al. (1998) models allow a mass determination (1.025 \u00b1 0.100 M\u2299 ) and an age determination\nof 35 Myr (30 Myr to MS) for the primary.\n\u2013 From our data we can exclude the presence of a third\nlow-mass companion in the system as suggested by\nMetchev & Hillenbrand(2004).\n\u2013 We also see variations in the H\u03b1 line wings which lead\nto a temperature difference between the two spectra\nof 120 K. This temperature change could be caused by\nhuge stellar spots. The effect on the line core and wings\nof the H\u03b2 lines is not as strong.\n\u2013 The precise RV measurements taken in the course of\nthe program shed more light on the activity of the star.\nWe find that the primary star shows large amplitude\nRV variations which are presumably caused by its high\nactivity level. In 2001 and 2002 the signal was periodic\nwith a period of 2.767 \u00b1 0.005 days. However, it seems\nthat this period is slightly different from the photometric rotation period (2.599 to 2.796, Strassmeier & Rice\n1998). This difference could be caused by differential\nrotation of the star. In 2002 this signal is significantly\nless obvious, and in 2003 almost absent. The periodic\nsignal can be recovered from the whole dataset if only\nspectra in which the photospheric lines are asymmetric\nare used. We interpret this signal as being due to spots\nthat are not located at the pole. However, the correlation between asymmetry and RV is weak. If the same\nanalysis is performed on spectra in which the photospheric lines are nearly symmetric, we cannot recover\nthe period signal of the RV variations. Also there is\nno obvious correlation between H\u03b1 and either the RV\nor the asymmetry. We interpret this by assuming that\nthe star has large spots on the pole and possibly the\nEvershed-flow of these spots affects the RV, as well as\nthe asymmetry signal. We conclude that in the case of\nEK Dra the RV signal is related to the rotation period of the star and is caused by its activity cannot be\nsimply subtracted from the RV signal to increase the\nsensibility for the detection of a possible third object.\nAcknowledgements.
