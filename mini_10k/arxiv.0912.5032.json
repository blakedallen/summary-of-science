INTRODUCTION\nM81 galaxy group is the nearest interacting\ngroup of galaxies whose main members are M81,\nM82 and NGC 3077. Yun et al. (1994) found prominent HI structures surrounding these galaxies with\nlarge HI complexes and tidal bridges, that are probably a result of the galaxy encounters. It is possible that starburst activity i.e. enhanced star formation of M82 was triggered in a close encounter with\nM81, which as a consequence have a high supernova\nrate (see e.g. Arbutina et al. 2007, Huang et al.\n1994). The third member in the group, NGC 3077\nalso shows evidence of enhanced star formation, and\nconsequently a higher supernova rate and presence\nof SNRs. This was partially confirmed by recent ra-\n\ndio observations (see Rosa-Gonzales 2005). There\nis also a number of optical candidates for supernova\nremnants (SNRs) detected in M81 (Matonick & Fesen 1997). The SNR candidates in optical are usually identified through enhanced [SII] line emission\n([SII]/H\u03b1 > 0.4; see e.g. Matonick & Fesen 1997,\nBlair & Long 2004). The aim of our optical observations was to try to detect new SNR candidates and\nHII regions in a small \"satellite galaxy\" of M81 \u2013\nHolmberg IX (UGC 5336, MCG+12-10-012, LEDA\n28757, see Table 1). Holmberg IX and Arp's loop\ncan be seen as two dark knots in the HI image of the\nM81 triplet of Yun et al. (1994). Dwarf irregular\ngalaxy Holmberg IX could be the youngest nearby\ntidal dwarf galaxy, perhaps formed during the last\nclose passage of M82 around M81 (Sabbi et al. 2008).\n87\n\n\fB.

The location of Holmberg IX,\nits high gas content, and its youthful stellar population, made from this galaxy the primary target of\nour search.\n\n88\n\nTable 2.

OBSERVATIONS AND\nDATA REDUCTION\nThe observation were carried out in March\nand November 2008 with the 2 m Ritchey-Chr\u00e9tienCoud\u00e9 (RCC) telescope at the National Astronomical Observatory (NAO) Rozhen, Bulgaria (\u03c6 =\n41\u25e6 41\u2032 35\u2032\u2032 , \u03bb = 24\u25e6 44\u2032 30\u2032\u2032 , h = 1759 m). In the RC\nfocus of the telescope, the equivalent focal length is\n16 m and the field-of-view is one square degree with\na scale 12 \u2032\u2032. 89/mm. The telescope is equipped with\nVersArray: 1300B CCD camera with 1340\u00d71300 px\narray, with plate scale of 0 \u2032\u2032. 257732/px (pixel size is\n20 \u03bcm), giving field of view 5\u2032 45\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 5\u2032 35\u2032\u2032 .\nWe used the narrow-band filters for [SII], H\u03b1\nand red continuum. We took sets of three images\nthrough each filter, each night, with exposure time\nranging from 1200\u20132400 s. Typical seeing was 1 \u2032\u2032. 5 \u2013\n3\u2032\u2032 . Standard stars images (Feige 34 and G191-B2B),\nbias frames and sky flat-fields were also taken. Filters characteristics and details of the observations\n1 Available\n\n90\n\nfrom http://www.astrosurf.com/buil/\n\nare given in Tables 2 and 3. The H\u03b1 image (\u03bb6563)\nis contaminated with some [NII] emission (\u03bb6583),\nso in principle the \"H\u03b1\" is actually H\u03b1+[NII] image.\nThe [SII] filter should collect most of the emission\nfrom both [SII] \u03bb6716 and \u03bb6731 lines.\nData reduction was performed by using IRIS1\n(an astronomical images processing software developed by Christian Buil). The data were bias subtracted and flat-fielded using the standard methods. Three images in each set are combined using procedures NGAIN3 and COMPOSIT, and then skysubstructed (SUBSKY). Commands MAX, MIN, EDGE\nwere used for cosmetic corrections (bad pixels, cosmic rays removal). Since the images were taken\nwith different exposures, depending on the filters, we\nscaled all the images normalizing them to the flux of\nthe stars in the field. Images taken on two nights\nare then combined to increase the counts, rotated,\naligned and distortion corrected by using the procedure COREGISTER. Images obtained after all these\ncorrections, are given in Figs. 1\u20133.\n\n\fOPTICAL OBSERVATIONS OF M81 GALAXY GROUP\n\nFig. 4. The continuum-subtracted H\u03b1 image. Dark features that are marked are sources.\nAdditional dark features are stars not subtracted well (compare Figs. 2 and 3).\nThe H\u03b1 and [SII] images are then continuumsubtracted and final images once again background\nsubtracted to obtain background as flat as possible.\nThe continuum-subtracted H\u03b1 image is given in Fig.\n4.\nSources in the continuum-subtracted H\u03b1 image are extracted by smoothing the image and then\ndrawing 1\u03c3 contours from the median value. Relative fluxes (total counts) are then calculated using\nIRIS photometric tools. Finally, an astrometric reduction of the H\u03b1 image was performed by using U.S.\nNaval Observatory's USNO-A2.0 astrometric catalogue (Monet et al. 1998).\n\n3. ANALYSIS AND RESULTS\nThe continuum-subtracted [SII] image did not\nshow any new object with an enhanced [SII] emission, besides M&H 10-11 or HoIX X-1 (Miller &\nHodge 1994, Miller 1995, Gris\u00e9 et al. 2006), a strong\noptical line source and ultraluminous X-ray source\n(a possible hypernova remnant or super-shell), and\nthereby is omitted. As for the continuum-subtracted\nH\u03b1 image, we detected 21 sources \u2013 probable HII regions (see Fig. 4; additional dark features are stars\nnot subtracted well).\n91\n\n\fB.

There are, possibly, two more smaller sources, marked with asterisk (*) in Fig. 4, at \u03b1J2000 = 09h 57m 30s .3, \u03b4J2000\n= +69\u25e6 02\u2032 52\u2032\u2032 and \u03b1J2000 = 09h 58m 04s .0, \u03b4J2000 =\n+69\u25e6 03\u2032 16\u2032\u2032 , for which we haven't measured fluxes.\nQuestion mark (?) in Fig. 4 marks the position of\na source of unknown origin (\u03b1J2000 = 09h 57m 30s .9,\n\u03b4J2000 = +69\u25e6 01\u2032 12\u2032\u2032 ) which we saw in March 2008\nH\u03b1 images, but not in November 2008.\nThe absolute flux calibration of the continuum\nsubtracted H\u03b1 image was performed by using the\nfluxes of sources identified both by us and Miller &\nHodge (1994) (See Fig. 5 and Table 4). The listed\nfluxes for sources M&H 6 and M&H 7 correspond to\nthe sum of the fluxes for the two sub-regions (A and\nB). We adopted simple linear relation\nF = c * N,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere N is source's total count, F the flux in units\n10\u221215 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 , and c = (4.97 \u00b1 0.05) \u00d7 10\u22125 is\ncalibration coefficient obtained from the fit.\nWe define the fractional error\nf=\n\nFM&H \u2212 F\nFM&H\n\n(2)\n\nwhere FM&H is the H\u03b1 flux from Miller & Hodge\n(1994), whereas F is our measurement, in order to\nget an estimate of the accuracy of the obtained values. We find fmax = 0.50 i f \u0304 = 0.16.\nEstimated fluxes for all sources (HII regions)\nand approximate positions of source centers are given\nin Table 5.\n4. CONCLUSIONS\nWe presented observations of Holmberg IX\ngalaxy in narrow band [SII] and H\u03b1 filters. Our\nsearch for objects with an enhanced [SII] emission \u2013\npossible supernova remnant candidates, has yielded\nno sources of this class, besides M&H 10-11 or HoIX\nX-1. Nevertheless we identified 21 objects with significant H\u03b1 emission. Eleven sources (1\u201311) were\npreviously identified by Miller & Hodge (1994) and\none by Boone et al. (2005) (source 12). Thus, we\nfound nine new sources (13\u201321) \u2013 uncatalogued HII\nregions. We estimated their H\u03b1 fluxes and gave their\napproximate positions.\n\nAcknowledgements \u2013 This research has been supported by the Ministry of Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia through\nprojects: No. 146002 \"Astrophysical Spectroscopy\nof Extragalactic Objects\", No. 146003 \"Physics of\nSun and Stars\", No. 146012 \"Gaseous and Stellar Components of Galaxies: Interaction and Evolution\", project \"The Rozhen Astronomical Observatory - Major Facility for the South East European\nRegion\" funded by UNESCO-ROSTE, and T\u00fcbitak\nproject No. 09ARTT150-458-0 \"Optical Search for\nSupernova Remnants in M81, M82, NGC3077\".\nREFERENCES\nArbutina, B., Uro\u0161evi\u0107, D. and Vukoti\u0107, B.: 2007,\nIAU Symp., 237, 391.\nBlair, W.P. and Long, K.S.: 2004, Astrophys.
