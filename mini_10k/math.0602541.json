Introduction\nDefinition 1.1. A field k is anti-Mordellic (or large) if every smooth curve with a k-point\nhas infinitely many k-points.\nSeparably closed fields, henselian fields, and real closed fields are examples of anti-Mordellic\nfields. An algebraic extension of an anti-Mordellic field is anti-Mordellic: see [Pop1996],\nProposition 1.2.\nDefinition 1.2. Let k be a field. A function field over k is a finitely generated extension K\nof k with trdeg(K|k) > 0.\nDefinition 1.3. The constant field of a field K finitely generated over k is the relative\nalgebraic closure of k in K.\nTheorem 1.4. There exists a formula \u03c6(t) that when interpreted in a field K finitely generated over an anti-Mordellic field k defines the constant field.\nTheorem 1.5. For each of the following classes of fields, there is a sentence that is true for\nfields in that class and false for fields in the other five classes:\n(1) finite and anti-Mordellic fields\n(2) number fields\n(3) function fields over finite fields\n(4) function fields over anti-Mordellic fields of characteristic > 0\n(5) function fields over anti-Mordellic fields of characteristic 0\n(6) function fields over number fields\nRemark 1.6. It is impossible to distinguish finite fields from anti-Mordellic fields with a single\nsentence, since a nontrivial ultraproduct of finite fields is anti-Mordellic.\nFinally, we have a few theorems characterizing algebraic dependence. Some of these require\nthat the ground field k be \"2-cohomologically well behaved\" in the sense of Definition 5.1 in\nSection 5. The following theorems will be proved in Section 5.\nTheorem 1.7. There exists a formula \u03c6n (t1 , . . . , tn ) such that for every K finitely generated\nover a real closed or separably closed field k, and every t1 , . . . , tn \u2208 K, the formula holds if\nand only if t1 , . . . , tn are algebraically dependent over k.\nDate: February 20, 2006.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification.

He thanks the Isaac Newton Institute for hosting a visit in the summer of 2005.\n1\n\n\fTheorem 1.8. Let k be a 2-cohomologically well behaved field. Let K|k be a finitely generated extension. Then there exists a first order formula (depending on K and k) with r free\nvariables, in the language of fields augmented by a predicate for a subfield, that when interpreted for elements t1 , . . . , tr \u2208 K with the subfield being k holds if and only if the elements\nare algebraically independent over k.\nCorollary 1.9. Let k be a finite field, a number field, or a 2-cohomologically well behaved\nanti-Mordellic field. Then there exists a first order formula (depending on K and k) with\nr free variables, in the language of fields, that when interpreted for elements t1 , . . . , tr \u2208 K\nholds if and only if the elements are algebraically independent over k.\nProof. Theorem 1.4 of [Poonen2005-uniform-preprint] handles the case where k is finite or a\nnumber field. If k is anti-Mordellic, combine Theorems 1.4 and 1.8.\n\u0003\nRemark 1.10. We do not know if Theorem 1.8 and Corollary 1.9 can be made uniform in k\nand K, i.e., whether the formula can be chosen independent of k and K.\n2. Defining the constants\nIn this section we prove Theorem 1.4.\nLemma 2.1. Let k be an infinite field of characteristic p. Let S0 be a finite subset of k, and\nn\nlet S = {sp : s \u2208 S0 , n \u2208 N}. Then k \u2212 S is infinite.\n\nProof. If k is algebraic over Fp , then S is finite, so k \u2212 S is infinite. Otherwise, choose t \u2208 k\nn\ntranscendental over Fp ; then for a given s \u2208 k, the set {sp : n \u2208 N} contains at most one\nelement of {tl : l is prime}, so k \u2212 S is infinite.\n\u0003\n\nLemma 2.2. Let k be an infinite field. Let V be a k-variety. Let {Ca } be a non-isotrivial\nfamily of curves of genus \u2265 2 over k with parameter a. Then there exist infinitely many\na \u2208 k such that all rational maps from V to Ca are constant.\n\nProof. Let p be the characteristic of k. A theorem of Severi [Samuel1966, Th\u00e9or\u00e8me 2] states\nthat there are only finitely many fields L between k and the function field K of V such that\nL is the function field of a curve of genus \u2265 2 over k and K is separable over L. Thus the\nset S of a \u2208 k such that Ca admits a non-constant rational map from V is a finite set S0\ntogether with (if p > 0) the pn -th powers of the elements of S0 for all n \u2208 N. By Lemma 2.1,\nk \u2212 S is infinite.\n\u0003\n\nProof of Theorem 1.4. Without loss of generality we may assume that k is relatively algebraically closed in K. The discriminant of x5 + ax + 1 (with respect to x) is 256a5 + 3125;\nif char k \u2208\n/ {2, 5}, this is a nonconstant squarefree polynomial in a, so the family of affine\ncurves Ca : y 2 = x5 +ax+1 has both smooth and nodal curves, and is therefore non-isotrivial.\nIf char k = 5, the family Ca : y 2 = x7 + ax + 1 is non-isotrivial for the same reason; and if\nchar k = 2, the family Ca : y 2 + y = x5 + ax is non-isotrivial, since a direct calculation (using\nthe fact that the unique Weierstrass point must be preserved) shows that no two members\nof this family are isomorphic over an algebraic closure of k. The projection x : Ca \u2192 A1 is\n\u00e9tale above 0 \u2208 A1 (k).\nFor a \u2208 K, define\n\u001a\n\u001b\nx1\nSa :=\n: (x1 , y1), (x2 , y2 ) \u2208 Ca (K) with x2 6= 0 .\nx2\n2\n\n\f(A very similar definition was used in the proof of [Koenigsmann2002, Theorem 2].) We\nhave\n(1) If a \u2208 k, then k \u2286 Sa . Proof: Let f (x, y) = 0 is the equation of Ca in A2 . Let c \u2208 k.\nThe map (x1 , x2 ) : Ca \u00d7 Ca \u2192 A2 is \u00e9tale above (0, 0), so the point (x1 , y1 , x2 , y2) =\n(0, 1, 0, 1) on the inverse image Y of the line x1 = cx2 in Ca \u00d7 Ca is smooth. Since k\nis anti-Mordellic, Y has infinitely many other k-points, so c \u2208 Sa .\n(2) There exists a0 \u2208 k such that Sa0 = k. Proof: Let V be an integral k-variety with\nfunction field K. Lemma 2.2 gives a0 \u2208 k such that there is no nonconstant rational\nmap V 99K Ca0 over k. Equivalently, Ca (K) = Ca (k). So Sa0 \u2286 k, and we already\nknow the opposite inclusion.\n(3) If a \u2208 K \u2212 k, then Sa is finite. Proof: By the function field analogue of the Mordell\nconjecture [Samuel1966, Th\u00e9or\u00e8me 4], Ca (K) is finite, so Sa (K) is finite.\nT\nLet A be the set of a \u2208 K such that Sa is a field containing a. Let L := a\u2208A Sa . Then L\nis uniformly definable by a formula. By (3), A \u2286 k (a finite field cannot contain an element\ntranscendental over k). Now by (1) and (2), L = k.\n\u0003\nRemark 2.3. Suppose K is finitely generated over a field k, and k is relatively algebraically\nclosed in K. By the Weil conjectures applied to Y , there exists an explicit positive integer\nm such that (1) is true also in the case where k is a finite field of size > m. Let Sa\u2032 be the\nunion of Sa with the set of zeros of xq \u2212 x in K for all q \u2208 {2, 3, . . . , m}. Let (1)', (2)', (3)'\nbe the statements analogous to (1), (2), (3) but with Sa\u2032 in place of Sa . Then (1)', (2)', (3)'\nremain true for anti-Mordellic k, but now (1)' and (3)' hold also for finite k.\n3. Some facts about quadratic forms\nProposition 3.1. Let q(x1 , . . . , xn ) be a quadratic form over a field K, and let L be a finite\nextension of K of odd degree. If q has a nontrivial zero over L, then q has a nontrivial zero\nover K.\nProof. This is well known: see [LangAlgebra, Chapter V, Exercise 28].\n\n\u0003\n\nCorollary 3.2. Let K be a field of characteristic not 2. Let q be a quadratic form over K.\nLet L be a purely inseparable extension of K. If q has a nontrivial zero over L, then q has\na nontrivial zero over K.\nProof. If q has a nontrivial zero over L, the coordinates of this zero generate a finite purely\ninseparable extension of K, so we may assume [L : K] < \u221e. Now the result follows from\nProposition 3.1.\n\u0003\nFor nonzero a, let hhaii denote the quadratic form x2 + ay 2 and let hha1 , . . . , an ii =\nhha1 ii \u2297 * * * \u2297 hhan ii be the n-fold Pfister form.\nLemma 3.3. Let k be a field, and let V be an integral k-variety with function field K.\nSuppose that v is a regular point on V , and that t1 , . . . , tm are part of a system of local\nparameters at v. Let q be a diagonal quadratic form over k having no nontrivial zero over\nthe residue field of v. Then q \u2297 hht1 , . . . , tm iid has no nontrivial zero over K.\nProof. This result is essentially contained in [Pop2002]. The proof is given again in Lemma A.5\nin [Poonen2005-uniform-preprint].\n\u0003\n3\n\n\fLemma 3.4. Let l be a field of characteristic not 2. Let L be a finitely generated extension\nof l. Suppose that every 3-fold Pfister form hha, b, cii over L has a nontrivial zero. Then\n(1) trdeg(L|l) \u2264 2.\n(2) If moreover L admits a valuation that is trivial on l\u00d7 such that l maps isomorphically\nto the residue field, and not every element of l is a square in l, then trdeg(L|l) \u2264 1.\nProof.\n(1) Let t1 , . . . , td be a transcendence basis for L|l. Let\nK be the maximal separable extension of l(t1 , . . . , td ) contained in L. Let V be an integral\nvariety over l with function field K. Replacing V by an open subset if necessary, we may\nassume that (t1 , . . . , td ) : V \u2192 Anl is \u00e9tale. If l is infinite, choose (a1 , . . . , ad ) \u2208 An (l) in the\nimage of V ; then by Lemma 3.3, hht1 \u2212 a1 , . . . , td \u2212 ad ii has no nontrivial zero over K, and\nhence by Corollary 3.2, no nontrivial zero over L. If l is finite, choose (a1 , . . . , ad ) \u2208 An (l\u2032 )\nin the image of V for some l\u2032 |l of odd degree, and repeat the previous argument with the\nminimal polynomial Pai (ti ) of ai over l in place of ti \u2212 ai . In either case, this Pfister form\ncontradicts the hypothesis if d \u2265 3. Thus d \u2264 2.\n(2) Suppose not. Then by (1), trdeg(L|l) = 2. By the resolution of singularities for\nsurfaces (see e.g. [Abhyankar1969]), we may choose a regular projective surface V over l\nwith function field L. The center of the given valuation on V is an l-rational point v \u2208 V (l);\nhence v is actually a smooth point of V . Choose local parameters u1 , u2 at v. Let \u03b1 \u2208 l be\na non-square. By Lemma 3.3, hh\u2212\u03b1, u1, u2 ii has no nontrivial zero over L. This contradicts\nthe hypothesis.\n\u0003\nLemma 3.5. Let X be a variety over an infinite field k. There exists an integer m such\nthat the points on X of degree \u2264 m over k are Zariski dense in X.\nProof. The desired property depends only on the birational class of X over k. Therefore,\nenlarging k, we may reduce to the case where X is a geometrically integral closed hypersurface\nin Pn . Choose P \u2208 (Pn \u2212 X)(k). Projection from Q determines a generically finite rational\nmap from X to Pn\u22121 , and the fibers above k-points in a Zariski dense open subset of Pn\u22121\ncontain points of bounded degree. These points are Zariski dense in X.\n\u0003\n4. Distinguishing classes of fields\nProposition 4.1. There is a sentence \u03c6 that is true for finite fields and anti-Mordellic fields,\nfalse for function fields over any field, and false for number fields.\nProof. Let K be a field. Define Sa\u2032 as in Remark 2.3. Let \u03c6 be the sentence saying that\nSa\u2032 = K for all a \u2208 K. This is true if K is finite or anti-Mordellic.\nIf K is a function field, then (3)' (whose proof is valid over any k) shows that for some a,\nthe set Sa\u2032 is finite. If K is a number field, then Sa\u2032 is finite for all but finitely many a, by\nthe Mordell conjecture [Faltings1983] applied to Ca . In both these cases, there exists a \u2208 K\nwith Sa\u2032 6= K.\n\u0003\nWe can generalize Theorem 1.4 to include finitely generated extensions of finite fields:\n\nProposition 4.2. There exists a formula that for K finitely generated over a finite or antiMordellic field k defines the constant field.\nProof. We may assume that k is relatively algebraically closed in K. We use the notation\nof the proof of Theorem 1.4 and Remark 2.3. Let A\u2032 be the set of a \u2208 K such that Sa\u2032 is a\n4\n\n\fT\nfield containing a. Let k1 := a\u2208A\u2032 Sa\u2032 . Theorem 1.3 of [Poonen2005-uniform-preprint] gives\na formula that defines the constant subfield if K is finitely generated over a finite field; over\nany field K, let k2 be the subset it defines. Define\n(\nk1 , if Sa\u2032 \u2287 k1 for every a \u2208 k1 ,\nk\u0303 :=\nk2 , otherwise.\nThe subset k\u0303 is definable by a uniform formula; we claim that k\u0303 = k.\nIf k is anti-Mordellic, then by the proof of Theorem 1.4, k1 = k, and k\u0303 = k1 = k.\nNow suppose k is finite, so k2 = k. The set k1 is a field (since it is an intersection of fields),\nand it contains k by Remark 2.3. If k1 = k, then k\u0303 = k. If k1 ) k, and a \u2208 k1 \u2212 k, then by\n(3), Sa\u2032 is finite, so it cannot contain k1 ; thus k\u0303 = k2 = k.\n\u0003\nProposition 4.3. There exists a sentence that is true for function fields over finite or antiMordellic fields and false for number fields and function fields over number fields.\nProof. Use the sentence that says that the formula in Proposition 4.2 defines a field satisfying\nthe sentence of Proposition 4.1.\n\u0003\nProposition 4.4. There is a sentence in the language of rings extended by a unary predicate that when interpreted in a function field K over a field k (not necessarily relatively\nalgebraically closed) with the unary predicate defining k is true if and only if k is finite.\nProof. By [Poonen2005-uniform-preprint, Remark 5.1], there is a formula \u03c6(x, y) in the language of rings such that when it is interpreted in a function field K with finite constant field\nl,\n{y \u2208 K : \u03c6(x, y)} = l[x]\nfor each x \u2208 K. By [Rumely1980], there is a formula \u03c8 defining a family of subsets that\nwhen interpreted in l(x) for l finite gives exactly the family of nontrivial valuation rings in\nl(x) (possibly with repeats).\nNow let K be a function field over an arbitrary field k. We claim that k is finite if and\nonly if for some x \u2208 K the following hold:\n(1) The set R defined by \u03c6(x, *) is a ring containing k and x.\n(2) The family F defined by \u03c8 interpreted over the fraction field L of R defines a set of\nnontrivial valuation rings in L, each containing k.\n(3) The intersection of the valuation rings in F is a field l.\n(4) The element x is not in l.\n(5) The field l maps isomorphically to the residue field of some valuation ring in F .\n(6) If 2 = 0, then [L : L2 ] = 2.\n(7) If 2 6= 0, then every 3-fold Pfister form hha, b, cii over L has a nontrivial zero, and\nsome element of l is not a square in l.\n(8) The intersection of the rings in F containing R equals R.\n(9) Every ideal aR + bR of R generated by two elements is principal.\n(10) The elements x \u2212 a for a \u2208 l are irreducible, and generate pairwise distinct ideals of\nR.\n(11) There exists a nonzero f \u2208 R divisible in R by x \u2212 a for all a \u2208 l.\n(These conditions can be expressed by a first order sentence in the language of rings with a\npredicate for k.)\n5\n\n\fIf k is finite, and x \u2208 K is not in the constant field l of K, then R = l[x] for a finite field\nl, and conditions (1)\u2013(11) hold.\nConversely, suppose that conditions (1)\u2013(11) hold for some x \u2208 K. If char K = 2, then\n(6) implies trdeg(L|l) \u2264 1. If char K 6= 2, then (5) and (7) imply that trdeg(L|l) \u2264 1, by\nLemma 3.4. Thus in every case, trdeg(L|l) \u2264 1. By (3), l is an intersection of valuation\nrings, so it is relatively algebraically closed in L. By (4), x \u2208 L \u2212 l, so trdeg(L|l) = 1. Since\nL is a function field over k and k \u2286 l, L is a function field of transcendence degree 1 over\nl. By (8), R is integrally closed in L; in particular it contains the integral closure R0 of l[x]\nin L. Thus R0 is a Dedekind domain with fraction field L. Any ring between a Dedekind\ndomain and its fraction field is itself a Dedekind domain, so R is a Dedekind domain. By\n(9), R is a principal ideal domain, and hence a unique factorization domain. Now (10) and\n(11) imply that l is finite. So k is finite.\n\u0003\nProposition 4.5. There is a sentence that is true for function fields over finite fields and\nfalse for function fields over anti-Mordellic fields.\nProof. Combine Propositions 4.2, and 4.4.\n\n\u0003\n\nProposition 4.6. There exists a sentence that for a function field K over a finite or antiMordellic field is true if and only if char K = 0.\nBefore beginning the proof of Proposition 4.6, we need a few definitions and a lemma. If\nM is an Abelian group and n \u2265 1,\nS let M[n] be the kernel of the multiplication-by-n map\nM \u2192 M. Also define Mtors := n\u22651 M[n]. If E : y 2 = f (x) is an elliptic curve over a\nfield K of characteristic 6= 2, and t \u2208 K, then the twisted elliptic curve Et is defined by\nf (t)y 2 = f (x) over K. We will use the following, which is essentially a special case of a\nresult of Moret-Bailly.\nLemma 4.7. Let k be a field of characteristic 0. Let K be a function field over k. Let\nE : y 2 = f (x) be an elliptic curve over k, where f is a cubic polynomial. Then there are\ninfinitely many t \u2208 K with f (t) \u2208 K \u00d7 \u2212 k \u00d7 K \u00d72 such that Et (K) is a finitely generated\nAbelian group with rk Et (K) = rk EndK (E).\nProof. We may enlarge k to assume that K is the function field of a geometrically irreducible\ncurve over k. Replacing f (x) by f (x + c) for suitable c \u2208 k, we may assume that f (0) 6= 0.\nWe use the terminology in [Moret-Bailly2005preprint, \u00a71.5]. Let \u0393 be the smooth projective model of the y 2 = x4 f (1/x); cf. [Moret-Bailly2005preprint, 1.4.5(ii)]. By [MoretBailly2005preprint, 2.3.1], there exists g \u2208 K \u2212 k that is admissible for \u0393. By [MoretBailly2005preprint, 1.8(ii) and 1.4.7], Good(k) \u2229 Z is infinite.\n1\nWe claim that for any \u03bb \u2208 Good(k) \u2229 Z, the value t := \u03bbg\nsatisfies the required conditions. For such \u03bb and t, we have \u03bb \u2208 Good(k) by [Moret-Bailly2005preprint, 1.5.4(i)]; thus\n1\nE \u2032 : (\u03bbg)4 f ( \u03bbg\n)y 2 = f (x) is an elliptic curve over K such that E \u2032 (K) is finitely generated\nand rk E \u2032 (K) = rk EndK (E). By definition, E \u2032 is isomorphic to Et .\nLet Kk be a compositum of K with an algebraic closure of k over k. If f (t) were in\nk \u00d7 K \u00d72 , then E \u2032 would be isomorphic over Kk to E, so E \u2032 (Kk) \u2243 E(Kk) \u2287 E(k) would not\nbe finitely generated, contradicting the definition of Good(k).\n\u0003\nProof of Proposition 4.6. Use \u00ac\u03c6, where \u03c6 is a sentence equivalent to the following: 2 = 0\nor there exists an extension L of K with [L : K] \u2264 2 such that for l the subset defined in\n6\n\n\fby the formula of Proposition 4.2 applied to L, there exist distinct e1 , e2 , e3 \u2208 l such that if\nwe write f (x) := (x \u2212 e1 )(x \u2212 e2 )(x \u2212 e3 ), then for all t \u2208 L with f (t) \u2208 L\u00d7 \u2212 l\u00d7 L\u00d72 , the\ntwist Et of E : y 2 = f (x) satisfies #Et (L)/2Et (L) \u2265 64. For the K we are interested in, L is\na function field over a finite or anti-Mordellic field, so l is the constant field of L.\nIf char K = 2, then \u03c6 is true. Now suppose K is a function field over an anti-Mordellic field\nof characteristic p > 2. Let L be a compositum of K with Fp2 . Let E be an elliptic curve over\nFp with #E(Fp ) = p + 1. Then the p2 -Frobenius endomorphism of E is multiplication by \u2212p,\nso rk EndFp2 (E) = 4, and E[2] \u2286 E(Fp2 ). The curve EFp2 has an equation y 2 = f (x) where\nf (x) := (x \u2212 e1 )(x \u2212 e2 )(x \u2212 e3 ) with distinct e1 , e2 , e3 \u2208 Fp2 \u2286 l. Suppose t \u2208 L satisfies\nf (t) \u2208 L\u00d7 \u2212 l\u00d7 L\u00d72 . The restriction on t implies that Et is not isomorphic over L to an\nelliptic curve over l, so Et (L) is finitely generated. Quadratic twists of an elliptic curve have\nthe same endomorphism ring, so the ring O := EndL (Et ) is a maximal order in a non-split\nquaternion algebra H over Q. Since Et (L) \u2297 Q is an H-vector\nspace, 4 | rkZ Et (L). The point\np\n(t, 1) \u2208 Et (L)p\nhas infinite order, since under the L( f (t))-isomorphism Et \u2192 E mapping\n(x, y) to (x, y f (t)) it corresponds to a point of E whose x-coordinate is transcendental\nover l. Thus rkZ Et (L) > 0, so rkZ Et (L) \u2265 4. Also, Et [2] \u2286 Et (L), so #Et (L)/2Et (L) \u2265\n22 * 24 = 64.\nNow suppose that K is a function field over an anti-Mordellic field of characteristic 0.\nSuppose L is an extension with [L : K] \u2264 2, and e1 , e2 , e3 \u2208 l are distinct. By Lemma 4.7\napplied to L over l, there exists t \u2208 L with f (t) \u2208\n/ l\u00d7 L\u00d72 such that Et (L) is finitely generated\nwith rk Et (L) = rk EndL (E). Since rk EndL (E) \u2208 {1, 2}, and since Et (L)tors is generated by\nat most 2 elements, we get #Et (L)/2Et (L) \u2264 22 * 22 = 16.\n\u0003\nProof of Theorem 1.5. Taking d = 0 in the first claim of Theorem 1.5(3) of [Pop2002] gives\na sentence that is true for number fields and false for function fields over number fields.\nCombining this with Propositions 4.1, 4.3, 4.5, and 4.6 gives the result.\n\u0003\n5. Detecting algebraic dependence\nWe begin by recalling the following general facts: Let E be an arbitrary field of characteristic 6= 2. In particular, \u03bc2 = {\u00b11} is contained in E. We denote by GE the absolute Galois\ngroup of E, and view \u03bc2 as a GE -module.\n1) Let cd02 (E) \u2208 N \u222a {\u221e} be the supremum over all the natural numbers n such that\nHn (E, \u03bc2 ) 6= 0. Since the 2-cohomological dimension cd2 (E) is defined similarly, but the\nsupremum is taken over all possible 2-torsion Gk -modules, one has\ncd02 (E) \u2264 cd2 (E) .\n\n\u221a\nAlso define vcd2 (E) := cd2 (E( \u22121)).\n2) Recall the Milnor Conjecture (proved by Voevodsky et al.) It asserts that the nth\ncohomological invariant en : In (E)/In+1 (E) \u2192 Hn (E, \u03bc2 ), which maps each n-fold Pfister\nform hha1 , . . . , an ii to the cup product (\u2212a1 ) \u222a * * * \u222a (\u2212an ), is a well defined isomorphism.\nUsing the Milnor Conjecture one can describe cd02 (E) via the behavior of Pfister forms as\nfollows: n > cd02 (E) if and only if every n-fold Pfister form over E represents 0 over E.\n3) There exists a field E with cd02 (E) < cd2 (E). For instance, let E be a maximal pro-2\nGalois extension of a global or local field of characteristic 6= 2. Then every element of E is\na square, so cd02 (E) = 0. On the other hand, since the Sylow 2-groups of GE are non-trivial,\none has cd2 (E) > 0 by [SerreGaloisCohomology, \u00a7I.3.3, Corollary 2].\n7\n\n\fDefinition 5.1. A field E is said to be\u221a2-cohomologically well behaved if char E 6= 2 and for\nevery finite extension E \u2032 |E containing \u22121 one has cd02 (E \u2032 ) = cd2 (E \u2032 ) < \u221e.\n\u2032\nRemark 5.2.\n\u221a If E is 2-cohomologically well behaved, then and E |E is a finite extension\ncontaining \u22121, then\ncd02 (E \u2032 ) = vcd2 (E \u2032 ) = vcd2 (E),\n\u221a\nsince cd2 (E \u2032 ) = cd2 (E( \u22121)) by [SerreGaloisCohomology, \u00a7II.4.2, Proposition 10].\n\nExample/Fact 5.3. The following fields, when of characteristic 6= 2, are 2-cohomologically\nwell behaved:\n\u2022 separably closed fields (trivial),\n\u2022 finite fields (follows from [SerreGaloisCohomology, II.\u00a73]),\n\u2022 local fields (follows from [SerreGaloisCohomology, II.\u00a74.3]),\n\u2022 number fields (follows from [SerreGaloisCohomology, II.\u00a74.4]), and\n\u2022 finitely generated fields (follows from the above and Proposition 5.4 below).\nProposition 5.4. If E is 2-cohomologically well behaved, and E \u2032 is a function field over E,\nthen E \u2032 is 2-cohomologically well behaved and vcd2 (E \u2032 ) = vcd2 (E) + trdeg(E \u2032 |E).\n\u221a\nProof. We may assume \u22121 \u2208 E. The case trdeg(E \u2032 |E) = 0 follows from Remark 5.2.\nBy induction on trdeg(E \u2032 |E), it will suffice to prove that cd02 (E \u2032 ) = vcd2 (E) + 1 for every\nextension E \u2032 |E with trdeg(E \u2032 |E) = 1. We may assume that E \u2032 is separably generated over\nE. Let X be a curve over E with function field E \u2032 , let P be a smooth point on X, let \u03ba be\nthe residue field of P , and let t \u2208 E \u2032 be a uniformizer at P . Let n = cd02 (\u03ba) = vcd2 (E). By\ndefinition, there exists an n-fold Pfister form hh\u01011 , . . . , \u0101n ii that does not represent 0 over \u03ba.\nLift each \u0101i to an ai in the local ring at P . Then hha1 , . . . , an , tii does not represent 0 over\nE \u2032 . Thus cd02 (E \u2032 ) \u2265 vcd2 (E) + 1. On the other hand, cd02 (E \u2032 ) \u2264 vcd2 (E \u2032 ) = vcd2 (E) + 1 by\n[SerreGaloisCohomology, \u00a7II.4.2, Proposition 11], so we have equality.\n\u0003\nProposition 5.5. Let k be a field which is 2-cohomologically well behaved, and let e =\nvcd2 (k). Let K|k be a finitely generated extension. Then the following hold:\n(1) For each n \u2208 Z\u22650 , there exists a sentence \u03c6n in the language of fields (depending\non e) such that \u03c6n is true in K if and only if trdeg(K|k) = n.\nOne can\n\u221a take \u03c6n to be the following sentence: Every (e + n + 1)-fold Pfister\u221aform\nover K[ \u22121] represents 0, but there exist (e + n)-fold Pfister forms over K[ \u22121]\nwhich do not represent 0.\n(2) For elements t1 , . . . , tr \u2208 K \u00d7 , the following are equivalent:\n(a) (t1 , . . . , tr ) are algebraically independent over k.\n(b) There\nexists a finite separable extension l|k (depending on t1 , . . . , tr ) containing\n\u221a\n\u22121 and elements a1 , . . . , ae , b1 , . . . , br \u2208 l\u00d7 such that hha1 , . . . , ae , t1 \u2212b1 , . . . tr \u2212\nbr ii does not represent 0 over Kl.\nProof.\n(1) By the discussion preceding Proposition 5.5 we have:\n\u221a\n\u221a\ncd02 (K[ \u22121]) = cd02 (k[ \u22121]) + trdeg(K|k) = e + trdeg(K|k).\nNow use the characterization of cd02 in terms of Pfister forms.\n8\n\n\f(2), (b) \u21d2 (a): Suppose for the sake of obtaining a contradiction\nthat (t1 , . . . , tr ) is\n\u221a\nalgebraically dependent over k. Let L = l(t1 , . . . , tr ) \u2282 Kl. Since \u22121 \u2208 l, we have:\ncd2 (L) = cd2 (l) + trdeg(L|l) = e + trdeg(L|l) < e + d\nThus by the discussion above, every (e + d)-fold Pfister form over L represents 0 over\nL. In particular, for all (ai )i and (bj )j as in (b), the resulting (e + d)-fold Pfister form\nhha1 , . . . , ae , t1 \u2212b1 , . . . tr \u2212br ii represents 0 over L. Since L \u2286 Kl, it follows that hha1 , . . . , ae , t1 \u2212\nb1 , . . . tr \u2212 br ii represents 0 over Kl, a contradiction!\n(2), (a) \u21d2 (b): The proof is an adaptation from and similar to [Pop2002], Section 1.\nBy extending the list T := (t1 , . . . , tr ), we may assume that it is a transcendence basis for\nK|k. Let K0 |k(T ) be the relative separable closure of k(T ) in K. Thus T is a separable\ntranscendence basis of K0 |k, and K|K0 is a finite purely inseparable field extension. Further\nlet R be the integral closure of k[T ] in K0 , and let X = Spec R. The k-embedding k[T ] \u0592\u2192 R\ndefines a finite k-morphism \u03c6 : X \u2192 Spec k[T ] = Ark . Further, since K0 |k(T ) is separable,\nthe k-morphism \u03c6 is generically \u00e9tale. Therefore, \u03c6 is \u00e9tale on \u221a\na Zariski dense open subset\nU \u2282 X \u2032 . We choose a finite separable extension l|k containing \u22121 such that U(l) is nonempty. Choose x \u2208 U(l), and let b := (b1 , . . . , br ) = \u03c6(x) be its image in Ark (l) = lr . Then\nt1 \u2212 b1 , . . . , tr \u2212 br are local parameters at x. Since cd02 l = e, we may choose a1 , . . . , ae \u2208 l\u00d7\nsuch that hha1 , . . . , ae ii has no nontrivial zero over l. Then by Lemma 3.3, hha1 , . . . , ae , t1 \u2212\nb1 , . . . , tr \u2212br ii has no nontrivial zero over K0 l. By Corollary 3.2, hha1 , . . . , ae , t1 \u2212b1 , . . . , tr \u2212\nbr ii has no nontrivial zero over Kl.\n\u0003\nProof of Theorem 1.8. Theorem 1.4 of [Poonen2005-uniform-preprint] handles the case where\nk is finite, so assume that k is infinite. By replacing k with a finite extension k \u2032 and simultaneously replacing K with Kk \u2032 (these extensions can be interpreted over (K, k)), we may\nassume\nthat K is the function field of a geometrically integral variety X over k where\n\u221a\n\u22121 \u2208 k, and by Lemma 3.5 we may assume that the points of degree \u2264 m on X are Zariski\ndense. Now, by the same proof as in Proposition 5.5(2), t1 , . . . , tr are algebraically independent over k if and only if there exists an extension l|k of degree \u2264 m such that there exist\na1 , . . . , ae , b1 , . . . , br \u2208 l\u00d7 such that hha1 , . . . , ae , t1 \u2212 b1 , . . . , tr \u2212 br ii has no nontrivial zero\nover Kl. The preceding statement is expressible as a certain first order formula evaluated at\nt1 , . . . , tr .\n\u0003\nUnfortunately, in the case char = 2 we do not have at our disposal an easy way to\nrelate trdeg(K|k) to (some) well understood invariants (say similar to the cohomological\n(p)\ndimension). In the case k is separably closed, one can though employ the theory of Ci\n(p)\nfields. Recall that a field E is said to be a Ci field, if every system of homogeneous forms\nf\u03c1 (X1 , . . . , Xn ) (\u03c1 = 1, . . . , r)\nP\nhas a non-trivial common zero, provided the degrees d\u03c1 of the forms satisfy: n > \u03c1 di\u03c1 and\n(p, d\u03c1 ) = 1 for all \u03c1.\n(p)\nThe following are well known facts about Ci fields, see e.g., [Pfister1995]:\n1) Suppose that E is a p-field, i.e., every finite extension E \u2032 |E has degree a power of p.\n(p)\nThen E is a C0 field.\n(p)\n(p)\n2) If E is a Ci field, then every finite extension E \u2032 |E is again a Ci field.\n9\n\n\f(p)\n\n3) If E is a Ci field, then the rational function field E(t) in one variable over E is an\n(p)\nCi+1 field.\n(p)\nIn particular, if k is a Ci field, and K|k is a function field with trdeg(K|k) = d, then K\n(p)\nis a Ci+d field.\nNow let K|k be a function field. For every l > 0 and every system t = (t1 , . . . , tr ) of\nelements of K \u00d7 , let\nX\n(l)\nq(t1 ,...,tr ) =\nti Xil\ni\n\nbe the \"generalized Pfister form\" of degree l in lr variables as introduced in [Pop2002],\nSection 1, p. 388. Here i is a multi-index i = (i1 , . . . , ir ), with 0 \u2264 ij < l.\nProposition 5.6. Let k be a p-field. Let K|k be a function field. For every l 6= char(K)\n(l)\nthat is relatively prime to p, and every system (t1 , . . . , tr ) of elements of K \u00d7 , let q(t1 ,...,tr ) be\nthe corresponding form of degree l in lr variables over K. Then one has:\n(l)\n\n(1) For every r > trdeg(K|k), and every (t1 , . . . , tr ), the resulting form q(t1 ,...,tr ) represents\n0 over K.\n(2) For a given system (t1 , . . . , tr ) the following conditions are equivalent:\n(a) (t1 , . . . , tr ) is algebraically independent over k.\n(l)\n(b) there exist b1 , . . . , br \u2208 k such that q(t1 \u2212b1 ,...,tr \u2212br ) does not represent 0 over K.\n(3) In particular, for each n \u2208 Z\u22650 there exists a sentence in the language of fields that\nholds for K if and only if trdeg(K|k) = n.\nThus given algebraically independent elements x1 , . . . , xr \u2208 K over k, the relative algebraic\nclosure L of k(x1 , . . . , xr ) in K is described by a predicate in one variable x as follows:\nL = { x \u2208 K | (x1 , . . . , xr , x) is not algebraically independent over k }\nProof of Proposition 5.6.\n(p)\n(1): By the discussion above, K is a Cd field for d = trdeg(K|k).\n(2), (b) \u21d2 (a): Let L = k(t1 , . . . , tr ). If t1 , . . . , tr are algebraically dependent, then\n(l)\ntrdeg(L|k) < r, so by (1), any form q(t1 \u2212b1 ,...,tr \u2212br ) represents 0 over L, and hence represents\n0 over K.\n(2), (a) \u21d2 (b): The proof is very similar to the proof of the corresponding implication\nin Proposition 5.5. The relative separable closure K0 of k(t1 , . . . , tr ) in K is the function\nfield of an \u00e9tale cover U \u2192 Ark with the morphism being given by (t1 , . . . , tr ). Choose\n(b1 , . . . , bn ) \u2208 Ar (k) and a closed point u \u2208 U above it. If l is the residue field of u, then\nK0 embeds into the iterated Laurent power series field \u039b := l((tr \u2212 br )) . . . ((t1 \u2212 b1 )), and\nK embeds into a purely inseparable finite extension \u039b\u2032 of \u039b. The field \u039b has a natural\nvaluation v whose value group is Zr ordered lexicographically, generated by v(ti \u2212 bi ) for\n(l)\n1 \u2264 i \u2264 r. The values of the coefficients of q(t1 \u2212b1 ,...,tr \u2212br ) are distinct modulo l (they even\na system of representatives for Zr /lZr ). If we extend v to a valuation v \u2032 on \u039b\u2032 , the value\ngroup G of v \u2032 contains Zr with index prime to l, so the v \u2032 -valuations of these coefficients have\ndistinct images in G/lG. Now for any non-zero system of elements x = (xi )i from K \u2286 \u039b\u2032 ,\n(l)\nq(t1 \u2212b1 ,...,tr \u2212br ) (x) is a sum of elements having distinct v \u2032 -valuations (distinct even modulo l).\n(l)\n\nSo q(t1 \u2212b1 ,...,tr \u2212br ) (x) 6= 0.\n\n10\n\n\fThe remaining assertions of Proposition 5.6 are clear.\n\n\u0003\n\nProof of Theorem 1.7.\nCase 1: char(k) 6= 2.\n\u221a\n\u22121] is the unique finite separable\nIf k is either real closed or separably\nclosed,\nthen\nl\n:=\nk[\n\u221a\nfield extension of k containing \u22121. Thus the result follows from Proposition 5.5 (2).\nCase 2: char(k) = 2.\nThen k is a 2-field, so it is a C(2)0 field. To conclude, one applies Proposition 5.6 with\np = 2 and l = 3.\n\u0003\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank Laurent Moret-Bailly for some discussions of his paper [Moret-Bailly2005preprint].\n\nReferences\n[Abhyankar1969] Shreeram Shankar Abhyankar, Resolution of singularities of algebraic surfaces, Algebraic\nGeometry (Internat.
