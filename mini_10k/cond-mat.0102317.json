Since fractal excitations are not possible on a hierarchical lattice (only combinations of compact droplets\nand domain walls can occur on it), the MKA cannot show\nthese low-lying excitations, and agrees with the droplet\npicture even for small system sizes at low temperatures\nwith a Gaussian distribution for the bonds Jij .\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nThere is still no agreement about the nature of the\nlow-temperature phase of the Ising spin glass, which is\ndefined by the Hamiltonian\nX\nJij Si Sj .\nH =\u2212\nhi,ji\n\nVery recently several papers have focussed on the \u00b1J\nIsing spin glass, where the nearest-neighbour couplings\ntake only the values 1 and \u22121, instead of being chosen\nfrom a Gaussian distribution. Evidence is accumulating\nthat the ground-state degeneracy introduces new effects.\nThus, Krzakala and Martin [10] argued that even if a system showed RSB at low temperatures, different valleys\nin the energy landscape would differ in entropy to the\nextend that for sufficiently large system sizes one state\nwould dominate the zero-temperature partition function,\nleading for instance to a trivial overlap distribution (i.e.\nan overlap distribution that is the sum of two \u03b4-functions\nat opposite values of the overlap). This argument is supported by simulations by Palassini and Young [11] who\nfind a crossover from a zero-temperature behaviour with\na trivial overlap distribution to a finite-temperature behaviour which seems to agree with the RSB scenario. In\ncontrast, Hed, Hartmann and Domany, claim to find a\nnon-trivial overlap distribution even at zero temperature\n[12].\n\nThe spins can take the values \u00b11, and the nearestneighbour couplings Jij are independent from each other\nand are most often chosen to be Gaussian distributed\nwith mean zero and a standard deviation J.\nWhile many Monte-Carlo simulations show properties conforming to the replica-symmetry-breaking (RSB)\nscenario (implying many low-temperature states and a\nlack of self-averaging) [1,2], other simulations [3] and\nanalytical arguments [4] favour the droplet picture (a\nscaling theory based on the existence of only one lowtemperature state and its time reverse). The ambiguities\nstem from the difficulty in reaching the asymptotic limit\nof low temperatures and large system sizes. Monte-Carlo\nresults are likely to be affected by finite-size and criticalpoint effects. We have recently shown that a system that\nis known to conform to the droplet picture at sufficiently\nlarge system sizes has features similar to those of RSB\nif only small systems are studied and if the temperature\nis not low enough [5,6]. This system is the hierarchical\nlattice, or, equivalently, the Migdal-Kadanoff approximation (MKA) applied to a cubic or hypercubic lattice. It\nis thus possible that the Ising spin glass on three- or fourdimensional lattices might show its true low-temperature\nproperties only beyond the length scales accessible to\npresent-day Monte-Carlo simulations.\nExact evaluation of ground states and low-lying excited states appears to indicate a scenario that agrees\nneither with the droplet picture nor with the RSB theory,\nbut shows instead low-lying excitations which are fractal\n[7,8]. Newman and Stein have argued [9] that such excitations cannot exist in the thermodynamic limit. As\nthe studied system sizes are very small, the phenomenon\n\nIt is the purpose of this paper to study the low temperature properties of the \u00b1J model in MKA in order to shed\nsome light on the results of Monte-Carlo simulations,\nand to determine the conditions under which the true\nlow-temperature behaviour should be visible. Our findings confirm the conjecture by Krzakala and Martin that\nthe zero-temperature behaviour is different from the lowtemperature behaviour, and they also confirm the scaling\nassumptions concerning the entropy differences used in\ntheir argument. Furthermore, our results show that the\ntrue asymptotic zero-temperature behaviour and the true\nlow-temperature behaviour can be seen only beyond the\nlength scales currently studied with Monte-Carlo simula1\n\n\f\uf8ee*\n\ntions.\nThe outline of this paper is as follows: In section II\nwe present our numerical results for the overlap distribution, the Binder parameter, and the recursion of the\ncouplings within MKA. In section III, we give scaling\narguments that yield the asymptotic exponents and the\ncrossover behaviour seen in the simulations. Section IV\nsummarizes and discusses the results.\n\n\uf8eb\n\nF (y, L) = \uf8f0 exp \uf8ediy\n\nX (Si(1) Si(2) + Sj(1) Sj(2) )\n2NL\n\nhiji\n\n\uf8f6 +\uf8f9\n\n\uf8f8 \uf8fb.\n\n(2)\n\nThe recursion relations for F (y, L) involve two- and fourspin terms, and can easily be evaluated numerically because all terms are now in an exponential. Having calculated F (y, L), one can then invert the Fourier transform\nto get P (q, L). Figure 2 shows our results for L = 16\nat different temperatures, and for T = 0.33 at different\nsystem sizes respectively. Due to the ground state degeneracy, the overlap distribution for fixed L does not change\nbelow a temperature for which most samples are in the\nground state. With increasing system size, the peaks in\nthe overlap distribution become sharper, and the probability of finding an overlap value near zero decreases,\nindicating that one state and its spin-flipped counterpart\ndominate the statistics.\n\nII. NUMERICAL RESULTS\n\nThe Migdal-Kadanoff approximation is a real-space\nrenormalization group the gives approximate recursion\nrelations for the various coupling constants. Evaluating\na thermodynamic quantity in MKA in d dimensions is\nequivalent to evaluating it on an hierarchical lattice that\nis constructed iteratively by replacing each bond by 2d\nbonds, as indicated in Fig. 1. The total number of bonds\nafter I iterations is 2dI . I = 1, the smallest non-trivial\nsystem that can be studied, corresponds to a system linear dimension L = 2, I = 2 corresponds to L = 4, I = 3\ncorresponds to L = 8 and so on. Note that the number of\nbonds on hierarchical lattice after I iterations is the same\nas the number of sites of a d-dimensional lattice of size\nL = 2I . Thermodynamic quantities are then evaluated\niteratively by tracing over the spins on the highest level\nof the hierarchy, until the lowest level is reached and the\ntrace over the remaining two spins is calculated [13]. This\nprocedure generates new effective couplings, which have\nto be included in the recursion relations. The recursion\nrelation of the width J(L) of the two-spin coupling is for\nsufficiently many iterations and sufficiently low temperature given by J(L) \u221d L\u03b8 , with \u03b8 \u2243 0.26 in MKA in three\ndimensions (which is the only dimension studied in this\npaper).\n\n5\n\nT=0.2\nT=0.33\nT=0.476\nT=0.625\nT=0.769\nT=1\n\nP(q,L)\n\n4\n3\n\nL=4\nL=8\nL=16\nL=32\n\n2\n1\n0\n\n0\n\n0,2\n\n0,4\nq\n\n0,6\n\n0,8\n\n0,2\n\n0,4\n\n0,6\n\n0,8\n\n1\n\nq\n\nFIG. 2.

The two curves for T = 0.33 and\nT = 0.2 are on top of each other, indicating that at these\nsizes and temperatures, the system is in the ground state\nwith a probability close to 1. The T = 0.625 curve coincides for L < 16 with the T = 0 curve, but branches\noff for larger L and approaches the slope -0.26 expected\nfrom the droplet picture and seen in a system with Gaussian distributed couplings (see [5]). The T = 0.476 curve\nseems to be affected by ground state effects for L \u2264 16,\nas it starts out close to the T = 0 curve and then has\na negative slope which becomes flatter for larger L. A\nslope flatter than that predicted by the droplet picture\nindicates an influence of the critical point, as discussed\nin [5]. For even larger L, the curve must become steeper\nagain and approach the slope of the droplet picture. Even\nthe T = 0.769 curve appears to be affected by the ground\n\nFIG. 1.

It seems\nunlikely that it becomes flatter for larger L, implying\nthat it is fundamentally different from the droplet picture, which should govern the behaviour of a sufficiently\nlarge system at low temperatures. The asymptotic slope\nof the T = 0 curve and the crossover length scale at which\na finite-temperature curve branches off from it will be derived further below. Furthermore, our results show that\nat system sizes smaller than around 16, the asymptotic\nlow-temperature behaviour is not visible for any temperature, as the influence of the critical point and of the\nground state are too strong.\n\n-1\n\n1-B\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n0.6\n\nP(q=0,L)\n\n0.4\n\n4\n\n8\n\n32\n\n16\n\n64\n\n128\n\nL\n\nFIG. 4.

For sufficiently large system sizes,\nthe main contribution to P (q = 0, L) at T = 0 must\ncome from samples where a domain wall costs no energy.\nA domain wall is introduced into the system by flipping\none of the two corner spins of the hierarchical lattice out\nof the ground state orientation, and by determining the\nnew ground state resulting with this boundary condition.\nSamples where such a domain wall costs no energy have\nzero effective coupling strength J(L) = 0 at length scale\nL, with J(L) resulting from the recursion relation for\nthe width of the distribution of the couplings under the\nrenormalization procedure. Figure 5 shows the probability of having J(L) = 0 (or, equivalently, of having a\ndomain wall with zero energy cost) as function of the\nsystem size L. One can see that the slope is identical\nto that expected from the droplet picture beyond length\nscales L = 32, and is only slightly steeper for smaller\nsystem sizes. This indicates that the \u00b1J model has a\ncrossover length around 32, which is not present in the\nmodel with Gaussian distributed couplings, where the\nslope agrees with the droplet picture even for the smallest system sizes.\nSince Figure 5 agrees with the droplet picture, it cannot explain the steep decrease of P (q = 0, L), and B at\nzero temperature. For small system sizes, not only domain walls, but also several small droplets can create a\nzero overlap, but this effect should become irrelevant for\nsufficiently large system sizes. The only remaining possibility is that while the probability for having a domain\nwall of zero energy agrees with the droplet picture, the\nweights of the two ground states with and without a do-\n\n32\n\nL\n\nFIG. 3.

(2) with\nrespect to y. This is done by evaluating F (y, L) for 3\nsmall values of y. The systematic error resulting from the\nfiniteness of y is found by evaluating F (y) for a few samples for many values of y, and by extrapolating to y \u2192 0.\nThe Binder parameter B = 0 in the high-temperature\nphase, and approaches 1 in the low-temperature phase\nif the overlap distribution is trivial. Within the droplet\npicture, 1 \u2212 B must scale as L\u2212\u03b8 for sufficiently large\nL. Figure 4 shows our results. As for the overlap distribution, the T = 0 curve is much steeper than the\nlimit slope expected from the droplet picture, and the\nlow-temperature curves branch off from it at a system\nsize that is larger for lower temperatures. In contrast\nto Figure 3, system sizes can be studied that are large\n3\n\n\fmain wall differ by a factor that increases with increasing\nsystem size. In order to check this hypothesis, we evaluated the degeneracies of the two ground states that are\nobtained by fixing the two corner spins in parallel and antiparallel orientation respectively, and derived from this\nthe probability that two identical replicas of the system\nare in the two different states. The result is shown in\nFigure 6. The curve is steeper by \u22121 compared to that\nof the droplet picture, indicating that entropy differences\nbetween ground states are the crucial factor causing the\ndeviation of the T = 0 results from the droplet picture.\n\nIII. SCALING ARGUMENTS\n\nThe main objective of the scaling theory presented here\nis to derive the asymptotic slope of the T = 0 curves, and\nto predict the crossover length scale at which curves at\nfinite T branch off from the T = 0 curve. As shown\nby our numerical data presented in the previous section,\nentropy differences between ground state configurations\nthat differ by a domain wall play a crucial role. Let us\ntherefore consider a system that has a ground state for\nwhich a domain wall costs no energy, and let us estimate\nthe order of magnitude of the entropy difference between\nthe two ground states. One of the ground states is obtained by fixing the two corner spins of the system (those\nwith the highest coordination number) in parallel orientation, and the other is obtained by making them antiparallel. Contributions to the entropy of each of these\ntwo states are made by droplet excitations that cost no\nenergy. (A droplet is a block of spins that are connected\nto each other and that does not include one of the two\ncorner spins, and it may comprise just a single spin).\nBy flipping several droplets, one can thus get from every configuration contributing to one of the two ground\nstates (with fixed corner spins) to every other configuration contributing to this state. The argument made in\nthe following is similar to the one made by Krzakala and\nMartin [10] for a system with supposed RSB in the lowtemperature phase. To each configuration contributing\nto the first ground state (with parallel corner spins), there\nexist configurations in the second ground state (with antiparallel corner spins) that differ from it only by a domain wall. This means that the two configurations can\nbe transformed into each other by flipping a coherent\nblock of spins including the right corner spin (assuming\nthat the left corner spin is up in both states). Now, all\nthe possible zero-energy droplets in the first configuration\nthat do not touch the domain wall, are also zero-energy\ndroplets in the second configuration. Droplets that do\nnot touch domain walls can therefore make no contribution to the entropy difference between the two ground\nstates, because they occur in both of them. The entropy difference between the two states results therefore\nfrom those droplets that touch the domain wall. Now,\nthe domain wall involves \u221d Lds bonds, where ds is the\nfractal dimension of the domain wall, and has the value\nds = d \u2212 1 in MKA. The average number of droplets\ntouching the domain wall can therefore be expected to\nbe \u221d Lds (assuming that the majority of droplets are\nsmall and independent from each other), and the typical\nfluctuation (measured over different samples, or over the\ntwo ground states) in the number of droplets touching\na domain wall can be expected to be \u221d Lds /2 , which is\nidentical to L in MKA in three dimensions.\nNow, the probability that two replicas have zero overlap is proportional to the probability that a domain wall\ncosts no energy, \u221d L\u2212\u03b8 , multiplied by the probability\nthat the configurations of the two replicas have a differ-\n\n0\n\nP(J(L)=0)\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\n1000\n\nL\n\nFIG. 5.

CONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper, we have studied the \u00b1J Ising spin glass\nwithin MKA. We have found that the zero-temperature\nbehaviour is fundamentally different from that at low\ntemperatures, due to entropy differences between ground\nstates. Only for length scales larger than of the order\nT \u2212ds/2 does the expected droplet-picture behaviour become visible. We have presented a scaling theory that\npredicts the asymptotic scaling exponent \u2212\u03b8 \u2212 ds /2 for\nthe overlap distribution at zero temperature, and we have\nshown from numerical results as well as from analytical\narguments that the approach to this asymptotic scaling\nmight be slow.\nOur findings shed some light on recent Monte-Carlo\nsimulations of the three-dimensional \u00b1J Ising spin glass.\nWhile the scaling arguments by Krzakala and Martin [10]\npredict a decrease of P (q = 0, L) at zero temperature at\nleast with an exponent \u2212ds /2 (if one assumes with them\nthat the system shows RSB, implying \u03b8 = 0), which lies\nsomewhere between -1.1 and -1.3, the best Monte-Carlo\nsimulations find only a value around -0.9 [11,14]. Other\nMonte-Carlo simulations giving a considerably smaller\nexponent probably do not sample the ground state configurations with the appropriate weights (see the comment by Marinari et al [15] on the simulations by Hatano\nand Gubernatis [16], and the remarks by Palassini and\nYoung [11] on the simulations by Hartmann [17].) Our\nfindings of a surprisingly slow approach to the correct\nasymptotic scaling can reconcile the Monte-Carlo results\nwith the predictions by Krzakala and Martin, and also\nwith our predictions based on the droplet picture (where\nthe asymptotic exponent is around -1.4 or -1.5), which\nwe believe to be the correct description of the spin-glass\nphase.\nOur results in Figure 3 show also that for not too low\ntemperatures the overlap distribution data may at first\n(for the smallest L values) be affected by the ground-state\ndegeneracy (as indicated by a slope that is initally steeper\nthan for larger L), then (for somewhat larger L) by the\ncritical point (manifesting itself in a pretty flat slope),\nand only for sufficiently large L (which may be beyond\nthe reach of Monte-Carlo simulations) the correct asymptotic slope given by the droplet picture. Given such a\ncomplicated behaviour, the predictions in [12] and [11]\nfor the asymptotic behaviour of P (q, L) based on small\nsystem sizes and assuming simple scaling forms have no\nconvincing basis.\nWe conclude that it is possible that the \u00b1J Ising spin\nglass in three dimensions and for system sizes smaller\nthan approximately 16 does not show the correct asymptotic scaling behaviour at any value of the temperature.\nIt remains to be seen whether the Ising spin glass with\na Gaussian bond distribution has also finite-size effects\nwhich make it impossible to see even at low temperatures\nthe correct asymptotic scaling behaviour for the system\nsizes presently used in computer simulations.\n\nNext, let us discuss possible reasons why the asymptotic slope \u2212\u03b8 \u2212 ds /2 is approached so slowly in all our\nplots. Our scaling argument is based on the assumption\nthat the size distribution of the droplets that touch the\ndomain wall does not change much with the system size.\nFor small system sizes, the droplet size distribution might\nbe far from the asymptotic droplet size distribution, possibly causing considerable deviations from asymptopia.\nThis effect is probably more severe in MKA than on a\nthree-dimensional lattice, because in MKA droplets consisting of a single spin with coordination number two\nmake no contribution to the entropy difference between\nthe two ground states. The reason is that flipping the domain wall transforms each spin next to the domain wall\nwith coordination number 2 that can be flipped without\nenergy cost (and which therefore makes a contribution\nto the entropy) into a spin that can be flipped only by\npaying the energy 4, while every spin with coordination\nnumber two along the domain wall that can be flipped\nonly by paying energy, is transformed into a spin that can\nbe flipped without energy cost. The numbers of the two\nclasses of spins must therefore be equal, and the entropy\ncontribution due to spins with coordination number two\nthat can be flipped without energy cost is the same for\nboth ground states.\nFurthermore, we have assumed that the fluctuation in\nthe numbers of droplets touching the domain wall is given\nby the central limit theorem, which is a good approximation only for sufficiently large system sizes. Deviations\nfrom the numbers predicted by the central limit theorem may be a further reason why the asymptotic slope\n\u2212\u03b8 \u2212 ds /2 is only visible for large system sizes.\nThird, we have assumed that domain walls make the\nmain contribution to P (q = 0, L). This assumption is not\ncorrect for small system sizes, where droplet excitations\nthat do not involve the corner spin may also add up to\nan overlap value of zero.\nFinally, let us determine the crossover length scale beyond which the droplet picture should become visible for\nsmall nonzero temperatures: Within the droplet picture,\nwe have P (q = 0, L) \u223c T L\u2212\u03b8 , while we have at zero temperature P (q = 0, L) \u223c L\u2212\u03b8\u2212ds/2 . A crossover between\nthe two regimes occurs when the two quantities are equal,\ni.e., when L \u223c T \u2212ds/2 .\n\n5\n\n\f[6] H. Bokil, B. Drossel and M.A. Moore, Phys. Rev.
