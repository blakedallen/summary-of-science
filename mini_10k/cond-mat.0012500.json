Charged particles moving near metallic surfaces loose energy\nas a consequence of the creation of different kind of excitations in the metal, such as\nelectron-hole pairs and both bulk and surface plasmons[3, 4]. Also, the theoretical\nunderstanding of the electronic excitations is well known to be relevant in surface\nphysics, as these modes are invariably involved in a variety of surface spectroscopies[59].\nQuantum-size effects (QSE) were first investigated by Schulte[10] within a jellium\nmodel of the thin film and later by Feibelman[11], showing that the various physical\nproperties exhibit an oscillatory behaviour as a function of the thickness of thin metallic\nfilms. These effects, which decrease as the size of the thin film increases, can be\nobserved experimentally[12]. QSE on the surface energy and the work function have\nbeen examined recently, within a stabilized jellium model of the electron system[13].\nIn this paper we focus on the investigation of QSE on the energy-loss spectra of\ncharged particles moving parallel with metallic slabs. The energy loss is calculated,\nwithin linear response theory, from the knowledge of the density-response function of\nthe inhomogeneous electron system, which we evaluate either in the random-phase\napproximation or with the use of an adiabatic and local exchange-correlation kernel.\n\u2217\n\nElectronic address: wmbgalea@lg.ehu.es; Fax: +34-94-464-8500\n\n\fIn Section 2 we present general expressions for the energy loss of charged particles\nmoving along a definite trajectory. The results of our self-consistent calculations are\npresented in Section 3, and in Section 4 our main conclusions are summarized. Atomic\nunits are used throughout, i.e., e2 = h\u0304 = me = 1.\n\n2\n\nTheory\n\nWe consider a recoiless particle of charge Z1 moving with constant velocity v along a\ndefinite trajectory at a fixed distance z from the planar surface of a bounded threedimensional electron gas that is translationally invariant in two directions. The energy\nthat the moving particle looses per unit path length, i.e., the so-called stopping power\nof the electron system may be obtained from the gradient along the particle trajectory\nof the self-consistent potential set up by the particle in the electron system and evaluated at the position of the particle[14]. Within linear response theory, one finds[15]:\ndE\n2\n\u2212\n= \u2212 Z12\ndx\nv\n\nZ\n\ndqk Z \u221e\nd\u03c9 \u03c9 ImW (z, z; qk , \u03c9) \u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 qk * v),\n(2\u03c0)2 0\n\n(1)\n\nwhere qk is the momentum transfer in the plane of the surface, \u03c9 represents the energy\ntransfer, and W (z, z; qk , \u03c9) is the screened interaction\nW (z, z \u2032 ; qk , \u03c9) = v(z, z \u2032 ; qk ) +\n\nZ\n\ndz1\n\nZ\n\ndz2 v(z, z1 ; qk ) \u03c7(z1 , z2 ; qk , \u03c9) v(z2, z \u2032 ; qk ),\n\n(2)\n\nv(z, z \u2032 ; qk ) and \u03c7(z, z \u2032 ; qk , \u03c9) being two-dimensional Fourier transforms of the bare\nCoulomb potential and the density-response function, respectively[16].\nThe stopping power of the electron system can be described by means of P (\u03c9), the\ntotal probability for the moving particle to exchange energy \u03c9 with the medium:\n\u2212\n\ndE\n1\n=\ndx\nv\n\nwhere\nP (\u03c9) = \u2212\n\nZ12\n\u03c02v\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u221e\n\n0\n\nd\u03c9 \u03c9 P (\u03c9),\n\n(3)\n\ndqx ImW (z, z; qk , \u03c9),\n\n(4)\n\nq\n\nwith qk = qx2 + (\u03c9/v)2 and qx being the momentum transfer along the particle trajectory.\nThe key ingredient of our energy-loss calculations is the density-response function\nof the electron system, which is known to satisfy the following integral equation[17]\n\u2032\n\n\u03c7(z, z ; qk , \u03c9) =\n\n0\n\n\u2032\n\n\u03c7 (z, z ; qk , \u03c9) +\nh\n\nZ\n\ndz1\n\nZ\n\ndz2 \u03c70 (z, z \u2032 ; qk , \u03c9)\ni\n\n\u00d7 v(z1 , z2 ; qk ) + fxc (z1 , z2 ; qk , \u03c9) \u03c7(z2 , z \u2032 ; qk , \u03c9),\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03c70 (z, z1 ; qk , \u03c9) is the density-response function of non-interacting electrons moving in the effective Kohn-Sham potential of density-functional theory (DFT)[18], and\nthe kernel fxc (z, z \u2032 ; qk , \u03c9) accounts for exchange-correlation (xc) effects beyond a timedependent Hartree approximation.\n\n\fExchange-correlation effects are usually introduced within the local-density approximation (LDA) of DFT, by replacing the xc potential at z by that of a uniform\nelectron gas of density n(z). The xc kernel entering Eq. (5) is then set either equal\nto zero [this is the random-phase approximation (RPA)] or equal to the static (\u03c9 = 0)\nxc kernel\n\"\n#\ndvxc (n)\nALDA\n\u2032\nfxc\n(z, z ; qk , \u03c9) =\n\u03b4(z \u2212 z \u2032 ).\n(6)\ndn\nn=n(z)\nThis is the so-called adiabatic local-density approximation (ALDA).\nWe consider a jellium slab of thickness a normal to the z axis, consisting of a fixed\nuniform positive background of density:\nn+ (z) =\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 n\u0304,\n\uf8f3\n\n0,\n\n\u2212a \u2264 0\n(7)\nelsewhere,\n\nplus a neutralizing cloud of interacting electrons of density n(z). The positive-background\ncharge density is n\u0304 = qF3 /3\u03c0 2 , where qF = (9\u03c0/4)1/3 /rs is the Fermi momentum and\nrs is the Wigner-Seitz radius.\nTo compute \u03c7(z, z \u2032 ; qk , \u03c9), we follow the method described in Ref. [19]. We first\nassume that n(z) vanishes at a distance z0 from either jellium edge, and expand the\none-electron wave functions in a Fourier sine series. The distance z0 and the number\nof sine functions kept in the expansion of the wave functions are chosen sufficiently\nlarge for our calculations to be insensitive to the precise values employed. We then\nintroduce a double-cosine representation for the density-response function, and find\nexplicit expressions for the screened interaction and the energy-loss probability in\nterms of the Fourier coefficients of the density-response function[15].\nQSE are originated in the quantization of the energy levels normal to the surface.\nAs the slab-thickness a increases new subbands for the z motion become occupied,\nthereby leading to oscillatory functions of a with and amplitude that decays approximately linearly with a and a period that equals \u03bbF /2, \u03bbF = 2\u03c0/qF being the Fermi\nwavelength. These size effects are responsible for the oscillatory behaviour of the\nelectronic density induced in the electron system by the external probe and also for\nthe oscillations of the energy-loss function and the stopping power with the system\nsize. The results presented below correspond to slabs with the number n of occupied\nsubbands in the range n = 11 \u2212 14, for which a \u223c 4 \u2212 7 \u03bbF .\n\n3\n\nResults\n\nWe have investigated thin-film effects on the energy-loss spectra of aluminum slabs,\nfor which rs = 2.07 and \u03bbF = 6.77 a0 (a0 is the Bohr radius, a0 = 0.529 \u00c5). We set\nZ1 = \u00b11 and our results can then be used for arbitrary values of Z1 , as the energy-loss\nprobability is, within linear-response theory, proportional to Z12 .\nThe main ingredient of our calculations is the energy-loss function ImW (z, z; qk , \u03c9).\nFig. 1 shows this quantity, as obtained from Eq. (2) with use of either the RPA or\nthe ALDA density-response function, versus the slab-thickness a and for z = 2 a0 ,\nqk = 0.4 qF , and \u03c9 = 0.2 \u03c9p [\u03c9p = (4\u03c0n\u0304)1/2 is the classical plasma frequency of a\nuniform electron gas of density n\u0304]. As a increases, new subbands for the z motion\n\n\fbecome occupied. For rs = 2.07, the n = 11, 12, 13, 14 subbands fall below the Fermi\nlevel for an = 4.95, 5.46, 5.96, 6.46 \u03bbF . When a new subband is pulled below the Fermi\nlevel, the parallel Fermi sea built upon the newly occupied subband acquires more\nelectrons, thereby increasing the screening and decreasing the energy-loss function.\nHowever, this effect is eventually overcome by the fact that all the subbands for the z\nmotion get deeper with increasing film thickness. When a is increased by \u223c \u03bbF /2, a\nnew subband begins to be filled and a new oscillation begins. The energy-loss function\nof a semi-infinite medium can then be extrapolated with the use of the following\nrelation[20]\n+\nImW [a\u2212\nn ] + ImW [an ] + ImW [an ]\nImW =\n,\n(8)\n3\n+\nwhere a\u2212\nn = an \u2212 \u03bbF /4 and an = an + \u03bbF /4.\nThe impact of short-range xc effects on the energy-loss function is investigated by\nemploying the many-body kernel of Eq. (6). These effects provoke a reduction in\nthe screening of the electron-electron interaction, thereby increasing the energy loss\nfor all projectile trajectories. This is observed in Fig. 2, where the RPA and ALDA\nenergy-loss function is shown as a function of the z coordinate [z \u2265 0 in the vacuum,\nat the right-hand side of the slab] for two different values of a corresponding to a local\nminimum (a = a11 ) and one of the two local maxima about the minimum (a = a\u2212\n11 ),\nand the same values of qk and \u03c9 as in Fig. 1. The energy-loss function of the semiinfinite medium is also shown, by a solid line. We find that size effects become more\nsignificant as the particle moves away from the surface into the vacuum, which is due\nto the fact that as z increases the external field couples mainly with plasmon modes.\nSince these are modes characterized by their long wavelength, their behaviour depends\nstrongly on the overall size of the system. For particles moving close to the surface the\ninteraction has a short-range character, as the excitation of electron-hole pairs plays\nan increasing role.\nFig. 5 shows the RPA and ALDA probability P (\u03c9), as obtained from Eq. (4)\nversus the slab thickness a, for an external particle with v = 0.5 v0 [v0 is the Bohr\nvelocity, v0 = 2.19 \u00d7 106 ms\u22121 ] and z = 2 a0 to exchange energy \u03c9 = 0.2 \u03c9p with an Al\nslab. This figure exhibits an oscillatory behaviour similar to that shown in Fig. 1 for\nthe energy-loss function. In Fig. 5 we have represented the RPA and ALDA energyloss probability P (\u03c9), as a function of the energy transfer \u03c9, with the same values of\nv, z and a as in Fig. 3. As in the case of the energy-loss function, ALDA probabilities\nare well over those obtained in the RPA, due to the presence of short-range xc effects.\nThe dependence of the RPA and ALDA stopping power on the thickness a of the\nslab, as obtained from Eq. (1), is exhibited in Fig. 5. We have considered a charged\nparticle moving with velocity v = 2 v0 along a definite trajectory at a fixed distance\nz = 2 a0 from the right edge of an Al film. For these values of z and v the ALDA\nstopping power is significantly larger than that obtained in the RPA. Fig. 5 shows the\nRPA and ALDA stopping power, as a function of the velocity, for a projectile moving\nat a fixed distance z = 2 a0 from the surface into the vacuum. As the velocity increases\nthe energy-loss spectrum of charged particles moving outside the solid is dominated\nby long-wavelength excitations and short-range xc effects, not included in the RPA,\ntend to become less important.\n\n\f4\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have investigated quantum-size effects on the energy-loss spectra of charged particles moving parallel with metallic slabs, in the framework of linear-response theory.\nWe have found that the quantization of the energy levels normal to the surface\nyields a neat oscillatory behaviour of the screened interaction, the energy-loss probability and the stopping power, as a function of the thickness of the slab. The amplitude\nof these oscillations is found to decay approximately linearly with the slab thickness\nand their period is found to equal \u223c \u03bbF /2. We have also presented self-consistent\ncalculations for a semi-infinite medium, which have been obtained from finte-slab calculations with the use of the extrapolation formula given in Ref. 20.\nOur results indicate that size effects become more significant as the particle moves\naway from the surface into the vacuum, where long-wavelength excitations play an\nimportant role. As for the impact of short-range xc effects on the various magnitudes\nthat characterize the interaction of charged particles with metallic films, we have found\nthat they increase the energy-loss probability, due to the reduction that these effects\nprovoke in the screening of electron-electron interactions.\nA more detailed presentation of our self-consistent calculations of the energy-loss\nspectra of charged particles moving near a semi-infinite electron system will be published elsewhere[15].\n\n5\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe acknowledge partial support by the University of the Basque Country, the Basque\nUnibertsitate eta Ikerketa Saila, and the Spanish Ministerio de Educaci\u00f3n y Cultura.\n\nReferences\n[1] D.
