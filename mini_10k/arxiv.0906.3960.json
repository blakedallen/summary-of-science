This is obtained by including the effects\nof highly massive Hagedorn resonances on statistical models, which are used to describe hadronic\nyields. The inclusion of Hagedorn states creates a dependence of the thermal fits on the Hagedorn\ntemperature, TH , which is assumed to be equal to Tc , \u221a\nand leads to an overall improvement of thermal\nfits. We find that for Au+Au collisions at RHIC at sNN = 200 GeV the best square fit measure,\n\u03c72 , occurs at Tc \u223c 176 MeV and produces a chemical freeze-out temperature of 172.6 MeV and a\nbaryon chemical potential of 39.7 MeV.\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nLattice QCD is the main non-perturbative theoretical tool used to probe bulk thermodynamics quantities\nof QCD such as its pressure, entropy density, and the\nspeed of sound. The QCD phase transition at vanishing baryonic chemical potential is a (rapid) crossover\nwhere the thermodynamic quantities vary significantly\nnear a critical temperature, whose value lies between\n170 \u2212 200 MeV. In fact, according to the BielefeldBNL/RIKEN-Columbia collaboration (RBC-Bielefeld)\nthe critical temperature is around Tc = 196 MeV [1]\n(although recently it has been concluded that the range\ncould be Tc = 180 \u2212 200 MeV [2]) whereas the Budapest/Marseille/Wuppertal (BMW) collaboration has\nfound a lower value Tc = 176 MeV [3]. Because the\nvalue of the critical temperature is vital to many phenomenological models of QCD, it is clearly important to\nfind experimentally driven signals able to distinguish between these two critical temperature regions. We shall\nshow in this Letter that thermal fits for the measured\n\u221a\nparticle ratios in Au+Au collisions at sN N = 200 GeV\nat RHIC can be used to determine the critical temperature of the QCD phase transition at nonzero baryonic\nchemical potential as long as effects from highly massive\nHagedorn resonances are included.\nThermal fits computed within statistical models are\nnormally used to reproduce hadron yield ratios in heavy\nion collisions [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. Thermal models computed at AGS, SIS, SPS, and RHIC energies can be\nused to construct a chemical freeze-out line in the QCD\nphase diagram [10]. For Au+Au collisions at RHIC at\n\u221a\nsN N = 200 GeV, specifically, estimates for the chemical freeze-out temperature and baryon chemical potential\nrange from Tch = 155 \u2212 169 MeV and \u03bcb = 20 \u2212 30 MeV\n[7, 8, 9].\nOriginally, it was thought that the chemical freezeout temperature and the critical temperature coincided.\nHowever, recent lattice results indicate a higher critical\ntemperature, which leads to a difference of \u2206T = 7 \u2212 45\nMeV between Tc and Tch . At SPS this difference was\n\nexplained by allowing hadrons, especially exotic antibaryonic states, to be \"born\" out of chemical equilibrium at Tc and reach chemical equilibrium through multimesonic collisions [12, 13] because chemical equilibration\ntimes of binary collisions are too long [14]. At RHIC,\nmulti-mesonic collisions are no longer adequate to explain chemical equilibration times [15, 16] and this has\nled some to believe that hadrons are \"born\" in chemical equilibrium [17, 18]. A way out of this scenario involving an overpopulation of pions and kaons has been\nsuggested in [19]. Another solution that has provided\nvery promising results is the inclusion of Hagedorn states,\nwhich are heavy resonances with an exponentially growing mass spectrum [20] that open up the phase space\nand help drive hadrons quickly into chemical equilibrium [21, 22, 23, 24]. When a reaction of the form\nn\u03c0 \u2194 HS \u2194 n\u03c0 + X X\u0304 is used where X X\u0304 = pp\u0304, K K\u0304,\nor \u039b\u039b\u0304, hadrons are able to reach chemical equilibrium\nat about Tch \u2248 160 MeV [22, 23] using various lattice\ncritical temperatures [23]. Moreover, it was shown that\nthe K/\u03c0 and (B + B\u0304)/\u03c0 ratios, where B = p + n, match\nRHIC data well [22].\nNot only have Hagedorn states provided a mechanism\nfor explaining the temperature difference between Tc and\nTch , but they have also been used to find a low \u03b7/s in\nthe hadron gas phase [25], which nears the string theory bound \u03b7/s = 1/(4\u03c0) [26]. Calculations of the trace\nanomaly including Hagedorn states also fits recent lattice results well and correctly describe the minimum of\nc2s near the phase transition found on the lattice [25].\nFurthermore, estimates for the bulk viscosity including\nHagedorn states in the hadron gas phase indicate that\n\u03b6/s increases near Tc , which agrees with the general analysis done in [27].\nAlthough Hagedorn's idea of an exponentially growing mass spectrum originated in the late 1960's, recent\nexperimental results maintain an exponential mass spectrum albeit with a higher Tc [28]. Moreover, it has been\nrecently shown in [29] that a Hagedorn spectrum does\nappear in QCD with a large number of colors. Moreover,\nthoughts on observing Hagedorn states in experiments\n\n\f2\nare given in [30] and their usage as a thermostat in [31].\nA possible method for describing the cross sections of\nHagedorn states was derived in [32].\nSince Hagedorn states have been shown to affect the\nchemical equilibration times, thermodynamic properties,\nand transport coefficients of hadron resonance gases close\nto Tc it is natural to expect that they may also be relevant\nin the thermal description of particle ratios. Moreover,\nbecause Hagedorn states are dependent on the limiting\nHagedorn temperature TH = Tc , a relationship between\nthe chemical freeze-out temperature and the critical temperature can be found by including Hagedorn states in\nthermal fits. This uniquely gives us the ability to distinguish between different critical temperature regions\ndepending on the quality of the fit obtained using the\nstatistical model.\n\nII.\n\nMODEL\n\nIn this paper we use a grand-canonical model to describe the particle densities from which we can calculate\nthe corresponding ratios as described in detail in [5]. We\ndo not include any strangeness suppression factor or, in\nother words, we assume \u03b3s = 1. In order to calculate the\nbaryonic chemical potential \u03bcb and the strange chemical\npotential \u03bcs we use the following conservation relation\nP\nn i Si\n,\n(1)\n0 = Pi\nn\ni i Bi\n\nwhich means that the total strangeness per baryon number is held at zero. There ni is the density of the ith\nparticle that has a corresponding baryon number Bi and\nstrangeness Si .\nHagedorn states are included in our hadron resonance\ngas model via the exponentially increasing density of\nstates\nZ M\nm\nA\nTH\n\u03c1(M ) =\ndm,\n(2)\n5 e\n4\nM0 [m2 + m2\nr]\nwhich follows from Hagedorn's original idea that you have\nan exponentially growing mass spectrum that has a limiting temperature, TH . Close to TH the Hagedorn states\nbecome increasingly relevant and heavier resonances are\n\"formed\" the closer you get to TH . We use the particles\nfrom the particle date group up until M0 = 2 GeV and\nthen we use Hagedorn states above 2 GeV. Additionally,\nA is the Hagedorn state \"degeneracy\", M is the maximum mass, and mr = 500 MeV, which is taken from\n[20, 28].\nIn this paper we use two different scenarios regarding\nTH . First we assume that TH = Tc , and then we consider\nthe two different different lattice results for Tc : Tc = 196\nMeV [1] and Tc = 176 MeV [3]. Futhermore, we take\ninto account effects from repulsive interactions between\nthe hadrons [33, 34] via the following excluded-volume\n\ncorrections [33]:\nT\u2217\nppt (T \u2217 , \u03bc\u2217\nb)\n\nT =\n1\u2212\n\n4B\n\n\u03bc\u2217b\nppt (T \u2217 , \u03bc\u2217\nb)\n\n\u03bcb =\n\n1\u2212\n4B\nppt (T \u2217 , \u03bc\u2217b )\npxv (T, \u03bcb ) =\nppt (T \u2217 , \u03bc\u2217\nb)\n1\u2212\n4B\n\u03b5pt (T \u2217 , \u03bc\u2217b )\n\u03b5xv (T, \u03bcb ) =\n\u03b5pt (T \u2217 , \u03bc\u2217\nb)\n1+\n4B\nnpt (T \u2217 , \u03bc\u2217b )\nnxv (T, \u03bcb ) =\n.\n\u03b5pt (T \u2217 , \u03bc\u2217\nb)\n1+\n4B\n\n(3)\n\nNote that the system's temperature T , baryonic chemical\npotential \u03bcb as well as the thermodynamic functions (after volume corrections) are defined in terms of the quantities computed in the point particle (subscript pt) approximation (i.e., no volume corrections). Note that B is\nequivalent to an effective MIT bag constant and is taken\nas a parameter in our model.\nIn order to find the maximum M Hagedorn state\nmasses and the degeneracy A, we fit our model to the\nthermodynamic properties of the lattice at zero chemical potential \u03bcb = 0. In the RBC-Bielefeld collaboration the thermodynamical properties are derived from\n\u03b5 \u2212 3p, which is what we fit in order to obtain the parameters for the Hagedorn states. In this case we set\nTH = 196 MeV and A = 0.5 GeV3/2 and obtain M = 20\n4\nGeV and B = (340 MeV) . For the BMW collaboration the energy density is fitted and we fix TH = 176\nMeV and A = 0.5 GeV3/2 and obtain M = 15 GeV and\n4\nB = (250 MeV) . Additionally, a discretized version of\nthe resonance spectrum is considered, which is separated\ninto mass bins of 100 MeV. Only mesonic, non-strange\nHagedorn states are considered in our calculations.\nIn our model we do not just consider the direct number\nof hadrons but also the indirect number that comes from\nother resonances. For example, for pions we consider also\nthe contribution from resonances such as \u03c1's, \u03c9's etc. The\nnumber of indirect hadrons can be calculated from the\nbranching ratios for each individual species in the particle\ndata book [35]. Moreover, there is also a contribution\nfrom the Hagedorn states to the total number of pions,\nkaons, and so on as described in [22, 23]. Thus the total\nnumber of \"effective\" pions can be described by\nX\nNi hni i\n(4)\n\u00d1\u03c0 = N\u03c0 +\ni\n\nwhereas the total number of \"effective\" protons, kaons,\nor lambdas (generalized as X) can be described by\nX\nNi hXi i\n(5)\n\u00d1X = NX +\ni\n\nwhere hXi is the average number of X = p's, K's, or \u039b's.\nHere N is the total number of each species and hni i is\n\n\f3\nthe average number of pions that each Hagedorn state\ndecays into.\nTo determine hXi we use the multiplicities in Fig. 2 of\nRef. [21] from the microcanonical model in [36] such that\np = 0.058 mi \u2212 0.10\nK + = 0.075 mi + 0.047\n\u039b = 0.04 mi \u2212 0.07.\n\nRHIC 200 GeV Au+Au\n0\n\n(6)\n\nClearly, they are all dependent on the mass of the ith\nHagedorn state. Of course, in principle, the branching ratios of potential Hagedorn states are not known. Future\nmeasurements of high exotic hadronic resonances can be\nused to obtain these ratios in the future. Following the\nprinciple of (maximum) missing information, we assume\nhere that the branching ratios can be obtained from a\nmicrocanonical calculation. Such a description is, for instance, also appropriate for describing the annihilation\nof p and anti-p.\nIn order to get an idea of the quality of the thermal\nfits, we define \u03c72 as\n\u0001\nX Riexp \u2212 Ritherm 2\n2\n\u03c7 =\n(7)\n\u03c3i2\ni\nwhere Ritherm is our ratio of hadron yields calculated\nwithin our thermal model whereas Riexp is the experimentally measured value of the hadron yield with its\ncorresponding error \u03c3i2 . In this paper we look at only\nthe experimental values at mid-rapidity and we used only\nthe systematic error given by each respective experiment.\nWe vary the temperature and \u03bcb according to the conservation laws in Eq. (1), in order to get the smallest\n\u03c72 . We use the experimental data from both STAR\n[37] and PHENIX [38] for Au+Au collisions at RHIC\n\u221a\nat sN N =200 GeV. Specifically, we observe the ratios:\n\u03c0 \u2212 /\u03c0 + , p\u0304/p, K \u2212 /K + , K + /\u03c0 + , p/\u03c0 + , and (\u039b + \u039b\u0304)/\u03c0 + .\nAll of which are calculated by STAR [37]. However,\nonly \u03c0 \u2212 /\u03c0 + , p\u0304/p, K \u2212 /K + , K + /\u03c0 + , p/\u03c0 + are given\nby PHENIX. Because there is such a difference between\np/\u03c0 + from PHENIX and STAR we choose only the value\nfrom STAR so that we can compare are results to [8]\nwhere they also exclude p/\u03c0 + from PHENIX. It should\nbe noted that Ref. [8] includes more ratios than we do\nsuch as multi-strange particles and resonances, which are\nnot included in this paper. This is because the purpose\nof this paper is not to confirm their results, which have\nalready been confirmed in [9], but rather to compare thermal fits that include the contribution of Hagedorn states\nand those that exclude them.\nIII.\n\nwhich gave \u03c72 = 21.2.

Because the\nRBC-Bielefeld critical temperature region is significantly\nhigher than its corresponding chemical freeze-out temperature the contribution of the Hagedorn states is minimal at only 4-11% (see Tab. I.). To further prove this\npoint we can vary the parameters that define the influence of Hagedorn states in the model. If, for instance,\nwe double the maximum mass we see in Fig. 3 that our\nthermal fits are not affected. This effect arises the true\nlimiting temperature after volume corrections is larger\nthan the critical temperature [25]. The effects of changing the maximum mass are only seen at temperatures\nlarger than the critical temperature, which are not considered in this study.\nWhile the maximum mass does not affect the quality\nof the fit, the parameter A, which is essentially the degeneracy of the Hagedorn states, does. The results of this\nare shown in Fig. 4. If we double A then we find that\nthe minimum \u03c72 for Tc = 196 MeV has dropped down\nto \u03c72 = 18.4, which is only slightly higher than the best\nfit for Tc = 176 MeV in Fig. 2. This indicates that at\n\n\u03c72\n17.8\n20.9\n17.8\n20.9\n20.4\n18.4\n\nTABLE II: Comparison of the chemical freeze-out temperature, baryonic chemical potential, and \u03c72 for various fits\nincluding Hagedorn states.\n\nTc = 196 MeV more Hagedorn states would be needed\nin order to get a better fit. However, we also see that\nfor Tc = 176 MeV and A=1.0 GeV3/2 that \u03c72 = 20.4.\nThe reason for this is that there is an overpopulation of\nHagedorn states. If we look at the contribution of Hagedorn states to the individual particle species we see that\nthe optimal contribution of Hagedorn states is around\n\u2248 40 \u00b1 10%, which is what we get for the fits Tc = 176\nMeV, A=0.5 GeV3/2 , M=15 GeV and Tc = 196 MeV,\nA=1.0 GeV3/2 , M=20 GeV as seen in Tab. I.\nA summary of our results is seen in Tab. II. We find\nthat the inclusion of Hagedorn states should not only\nprovide a better fit but they also affect the chemical\nfreeze-out temperature and the baryonic chemical potential. The more mesonic Hagedorn states are present the\nlarger \u03bcb becomes. Furthermore, our fits also have higher\nTch 's than seen in the fit without the effects of Hagedorn\nstates.\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper we assumed that the particle ratios mea\u221a\nsured in Au+Au collisions at RHIC at sN N = 200\nGeV admit a purely statistical description at chemical\nfreeze-out. Our results for thermal fits without Hagedorn\n\n\f5\nstates concur well with other thermal fit models [8] where\nthe chemical freeze-out temperature (Tch = 160.4 MeV)\nis almost identical and the baryonic chemical potential\n(\u03bcb = 22.9 MeV) is only slightly larger. The thermal fit\nwith the known particles in the particle data group provides a decent fit with \u03c72 = 21.2. However, the inclusion\nof Hagedorn states provides an even better fit to the experimental data. In fact, we find \u03c72 = 17.8, Tch = 172.6\nMeV, and \u03bcb = 39.7 MeV for the BMW collaboration\nwhile for the RBC-Bielefeld collaboration we obtained\n\u03c72 = 20.9, Tch = 165.9 MeV, and \u03bcb = 20.9 MeV. This\nprovides further evidence [22, 23, 24, 25] that Hagedorn\nstates should be included in a description of hadronic\nmatter near Tc . Since the chemical freeze-out temperature was found to increase from 160 MeV to roughly\n165 MeV (RBC-Bielefeld) or 172 MeV (BMW) when including Hagedorn states, this exemplifies the degree of\nuncertainty in extracting chemical freeze-out thermodynamical parameters by means of such thermal analyzes.\nFurthermore, because Hagedorn states provide a\nbridge between the chemical freeze-out temperature and\nthe critical temperature, we were able to make a qualified statement about which critical temperature region is\nmore appropriate according to the quality of the thermal\nfits. We find that lower critical temperature regions are\nfavored because more Hagedorn states are present close\nto the chemical freeze-out temperature and that a substantial number of Hagedorn states (i.e. a contribution\nof about 40% to the total particle numbers) are needed\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n\nM.

C\n2, 351 (1998)\n\nin order to provide the best fit to the hadron yield ratios.\nA lower \u03c72 can be obtained for the higher critical temperature region when we double the degeneracy of the\nHagedorn states, which would lead to a mismatch between our thermodynamic quantities and those computed\non the lattice (recall that the parameters that define the\nexponential spectrum in this case are obtained by fitting\nthe results of the RBC-Bielefeld collaboration at \u03bcb = 0).\nAs we can see from Tab. II a change in the parameters\neven when they are doubled still gives a better fit than the\nthermal fits without Hagedorn states because a contribution of Hagedorn states as small as 4-11% still contribute\nenough to lower \u03c72 . Therefore, this reconfirms the importance of including Hagedorn states in the hadron gas\nphase and, consequently, in the computation of thermal\nfits. Moreover, our results indicate that hadronization\nand chemical equilibration do not need to occur at the\nsame temperature in order to explain RHIC data.\n\nV.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nJ.N. acknowledges support from US-DOE Nuclear Science Grant No. DE-FG02-93ER40764.
