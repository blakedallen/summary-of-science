Novel techniques for fabrication of nanomagnets arrays20 and\napplications towards biomedicine21 show exciting new promises. Overall, the detection and\nunderstanding of nanomagnet dynamics down to the single nanomagnet regime have become\nincreasingly important. Investigation of picosecond dynamics of arrays of nano-scale magnetic dots has\ninferred that, for dot sizes less than 200 nm, the response of the magnetization to a pulsed magnetic field\nis spatially non-uniform and is dominated by localized spin wave modes.22 This non-uniformity may\nresult in a degradation of the signal to noise ratio in future nanomagnetic devices. However, the\nmeasurements were done in densely packed arrays where the intrinsic dynamics of the individual dots\nare strongly influenced by the magnetostatic stray fields of the neighbouring dots. Magnetostatically\ncoupled nanomagnets in a dense array may show collective behaviors both in the quasistatic\nmagnetization reversal23 and in the precessional dynamics.22, 24-28 In the quasistatic regime the strong\ninter-dot magnetostatic interactions result in collective rotation of magnetic spins and formation of flux\nclosure through a number of dots during the reversal. On the other hand, in the collective precessional\ndynamics the constituent nanomagnets maintain definite amplitude and phase relationships.\nMagnetization dynamics in dense arrays of nanomagnets have been studied both experimentally by timedomain,22,24 frequency-domain25-26 and wave-vector-domain27-28 techniques; and theoretically by\nanalytical29-30 and micromagnetic31 methods. To this end the frequency, damping and spatial patterns of\nspin waves and dispersion relations of frequency with wave-vector of spin wave propagation have been\nstudied.\n\n3\n\n\fOn the other hand, magnetization dynamics of isolated nanomagnets with lateral dimensions\ndown to 125 nm have been reported by time-resolved magneto-optical techniques.3,5,6,8,9 However,\npicosecond magnetization dynamics including the damping behavior of isolated nanomagnets down to\n50 nm size has never been reported. Here, we present an all-optical far field measurement of the\npicosecond magnetization dynamics of arrays of square Ni80Fe20 (permalloy) dots with 50 nm width and\nwith varying edge-to-edge separation (S) between 200 nm and 50 nm. When the dots are separated by\nlarge distance (S \u2265 150 nm) they reveal the dynamics of the isolated nanomagnet. The isolated\nnanomagnets revealed a single resonant mode, whose damping is slightly higher than the unpatterned\nthin film value. With the decrease in inter-dot separation the effects of dipolar and quadrupolar\ninteractions become important, and we observe an increase in precession frequency and damping. At the\nhighest areal density a sudden jump in the apparent damping is observed due to the mutual dephasing of\ntwo closely spaced eigenmodes of the array.\n\nRESULS AND DISCUSSION\n10 \u03bcm \u00d7 10 \u03bcm square arrays of permalloy dots with nominal dimensions as 50 nm width, 20\nnm thickness and separation S varying from 50 nm to 200 nm were prepared by a combination of\nelectron beam evaporation and electron-beam lithography. Figure 1(a) presents the scanning electron\nmicrographs of three of these dot arrays, which show that there are some deviations in the shape and\ndimensions of the samples from the nominal shape and dimensions, although the general features are\nmaintained. A square permalloy dot with 10 \u03bcm width and 20 nm thickness was also prepared to obtain\nthe magnetic parameters of the unpatterned sample. The ultrafast magnetization dynamics was measured\nby using a home-built time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect microscope based upon a two-color\ncollinear pump-probe set-up.32 The two-color collinear arrangement enabled us to achieve a very good\nspatial resolution and sensitivity even in an all-optical excitation and detection scheme of the\nprecessional dynamics. A schematic of the measurement geometry is shown in Fig. 1(b). The time4\n\n\fresolved data was recorded for a maximum duration of 1 ns and this was found to be sufficient to record\nall important features of the dynamics including the spectral resolution of the double peaks for the\nsample with S = 50 nm and measurement of the damping coefficient. Figure 1(c) shows the timeresolved reflectivity and Kerr rotation data from the array with separation S = 50 nm at a bias field H =\n2.5 kOe. The reflectivity shows a sharp rise followed by a bi-exponential decay. On the other hand the\ntime-resolved Kerr rotation shows a fast demagnetization within 500 fs and a bi-exponential decay with\ndecay constants of about 8 ps and 116 ps. The demagnetization and decay times are found to be\nindependent of the areal density of the arrays. The precessional dynamics appears as an oscillatory\nsignal2 above the decaying part of the time-resolved Kerr rotation data. The bi-exponential background\nis subtracted from the time-resolved Kerr signal before performing the fast Fourier transform (FFT) to\nfind out the corresponding power spectra.\n\nFigure 2 shows the time-resolved Kerr rotation from the permalloy dot arrays with S varying\nbetween 50 nm and 200 nm at H = 2.5 kOe. Clear precession is observed down to S = 200 nm, where the\ndots are expected to be magnetostatically isolated and hence exhibit single dot like behavior. The\ncorresponding FFT spectrum (Fig. 2(b)) shows a dominant single peak at 9.04 GHz. As S decreases the\nprecession continues to have a single resonant mode but the peak frequency generally increases with the\ndecrease in S. For S = 150 nm, the peak frequency decreases slightly although the errors bars are large\nenough to maintain the general trend of increase in the frequency with the decrease in S as stated above.\nAt S = 50 nm the single resonant mode splits into two closely spaced modes with the appearance of a\nlower frequency peak. In Fig. 2(c), we show the FFT spectra of the time-resolved magnetization\nobtained from micromagnetic simulations of arrays of 7 \u00d7 7 dots using the OOMMF software.33 In\ngeneral, the deviation in the shape and dimensions as observed in the experimental samples are included\nin the simulated samples but the precise edge roughness profiles and deformations are not always\npossible to include in the finite difference method based micromagnetic simulations used here, where\nsamples are divided into rectangular prism like cells. In the simulation the arrays were divided into cells\n5\n\n\fof 2.5 \u00d7 2.5 \u00d7 20 nm3 dimensions and material's parameters for permalloy were used as \u03b3 = 18.5\nMHz/Oe, HK = 0, MS = 860 emu/cc and A = 1.3 \u00d7 10-6 erg/cm. The material's parameters for permalloy\nwere obtained by measuring the precession frequency of the unpatterned thin film as a function of the inplane bias field and by fitting the bias field variation of frequency with Kittel's formula. The exchange\nstiffness constant A was obtained from literature.34 The lateral cell size is well below the exchange\nlength l ex =\n\n2A\nof permalloy (5.3 nm) and further reduction of cell size does not change the\n\u03bc 0 M S2\n\nmagnetic energies appreciably. Test simulations with discretization along the thickness of the samples\ndo not show any variation in the resonant modes, which is expected as this will only affect the\nperpendicular standing spin waves, whereas in the present study we have concentrated on the spinwaves with in-plane component of wave-vector. The equilibrium states are obtained by allowing the\nsystem to relax under the bias field for sufficient time so that the maximum torque (m \u00d7 H, m = M/MS)\ngoes well below 10-6 A/m. The dynamic simulations were obtained for a total duration of 4 ns at time\nsteps of 5 ps. Consequently, the simulated linewidths of the resonant modes are narrower, which enabled\nus to clearly resolve the mode splitting in the simulation. The simulation reproduces the important\nfeatures as observed in the experiment, namely the observation of a single resonant mode for the arrays\nwith S varying between 200 nm and 75 nm, a systematic increase in the resonant mode frequency with\nthe decrease in S, and finally a mode splitting at S = 50 nm. However, the increase in the resonant\nfrequency with decrease in S is less steep as compared to the experimental result. The deviation is larger\nfor smaller values of S possibly due to the increased non-idealities in the physical structures of the\nsamples in this range, as discussed earlier. Furthermore the relative intensities of the two modes\nobserved for the array with S = 50 nm are not reproduced by the simulation. This is possibly because the\nlower frequency mode is a propagating mode and the finite boundary of the simulated array of 7 \u00d7 7\nelements may cause much faster decay of the propagating mode as opposed to that in the much larger\narray of 100 \u00d7 100 elements studied experimentally. In Fig. 3(a), we plot the precession frequency as a\nfunction of the ratio of width (w) to centre to centre separation (a), where a = w + S. For w/a \u2264 0.25 (S \u2265\n6\n\n\f150 nm) the frequency is almost constant but for w/a > 0.25 (S < 150 nm) the frequency increases\nsharply both for the experimental and simulated data. We fit both data with Eq. 1 including both dipolar\nand quadrupolar interaction terms.35\n3\n\n\uf8eb w\uf8f6\n\uf8eb w\uf8f6\nf = f 0 \u2212 A\uf8ec \uf8f7 + B\uf8ec \uf8f7\n\uf8eda\uf8f8\n\uf8eda\uf8f8\n\n5\n\n[1],\n\nwhere A and B are the strengths of the dipolar and quadrupolar interactions. The fitted data are shown by\nsolid lines in Fig. 3(a). The simulated data fits well with Eq. 1, while the fit is reasonable for the\nexperimental data, primarily due to the large deviation in data points for the arrays with S = 75 and 150\nnm. However, the theoretical curve passes through the error bars for those data points. The quadrupolar\ncontribution is dominant over the dipolar contribution as is also evident from the sharp increase in the\nfrequency for w/a > 0.25. The dipolar contributions extracted from the curve fitting are almost identical\nfor both experimental and simulated results, whereas for the experimental data the quadrupolar\ncontribution is about 30% greater than that for the simulated data..\n\nVARIATION OF DAMPING OF PRECESSION WITH AREAL DENSITY OF THE ARRAYS\nWe have further investigated the damping behavior of the nanomagnets in the array. The time\ndomain data was fitted with a damped sine curve\n\u2212t\n\nM ( t ) = M ( 0 ) e \u03c4 sin (2 \u03c0 ft \u2212 \u03c6 )\n\n[2],\n\nwhere the relaxation time \u03c4 is related to the Gilbert damping coefficient \u03b1 by the relation\n\n\u03c4=\n\n1\n, f is the experimentally obtained precession frequency and \u03c6 is the initial phase of the\n2\u03c0f\u03b1\n\noscillation. The fitted data is shown by solid lines in Fig. 2(a). The damping coefficient \u03b1, as extracted\nfrom the above fitting, is plotted as a function of the inter-dot separation S along with the error bars in\n7\n\n\fFig. 3(b). The sample with S = 200 nm shows the lowest \u03b1 of about 0.023. This value of \u03b1 is slightly\nhigher than the damping coefficient (0.017) measured for a permalloy film of 20 nm thickness grown\nunder identical conditions to those for the arrays of permalloy dots. Since the dots are magnetostatically\nisolated, the increase in damping due to the mutual dynamic dephasing of the permalloy dots is unlikely\nfor S = 200 nm. Another possibility is the dephasing of more than one mode within the individual dots,36\nwhich is also ruled out due to the appearance of a dominant single mode in the individual dots. Hence,\nwe believe this increase in damping is possibly due to the defects37 produced in these dots during\nnanofabrication, which is quite likely due to the small size of these dots. As S decreases, the\nmagnetostatic interaction between the dots becomes more prominent and hence the mutual dephasing of\nslightly out-of-phase magnetization precession of the dots in the array becomes more prominent,31 and\nconsequently \u03b1 increases systematically with the decrease in S down to 75 nm. At S = 50 nm a different\nsituation arises, where the single resonant mode splits into two closely spaced modes and the apparent\ndamping (square symbol in Fig. 3(b)) of the time-domain oscillatory signal jumps suddenly from 0.032\nto 0.066. Clearly, this is due to the out-of-phase superposition of two closely spaced modes within the\narray, as shown later in this article. In order to understand the correct damping behavior of the uniform\nresonant mode we have isolated the time-domain signal for the mode 1 from the lower lying mode\n(mode 2) by using fast Fourier filtering. The extracted damping of the filtered time-domain signal for the\nsample with S = 50 nm is about 0.033, which is consistent with the systematic increase in the damping\ncoefficient of the arrays with decreasing S, as shown by the circular symbols in Fig. 3(b).\n\nMICROMAGNETIC ANALYSIS OF THE OBSERVED PRECESSIONAL DYNAMICS\nIn order to gain more insight into the dynamics, we have calculated the magnetostatic field\ndistribution of the simulated arrays and the contour plot of the magnetostatic fields from the 3 \u00d7 3 dots\nat the centre of the array is shown in Fig. 4. At larger separations the stray fields from the dots remain\nconfined close to their boundaries and the interactions between the dots is negligible. As the inter-dot\nseparation decreases the stray fields of the neighboring dots start to overlap causing an increase in the\n8\n\n\feffective field acting on the dots and consequently the corresponding precession frequency. At S = 50\nnm the stray field is large enough to cause a strong magnetostatic coupling between the dots and hence\nthe collective precession modes of the dots in the array.31 The spatial natures of the modes were\ninvestigated by numerically calculating the spatial distributions of amplitudes and phases corresponding\nto the resonant modes of the samples. The amplitude and phase maps of resonant modes for the arrays\nwith S = 50 nm and 200 nm are shown in Figs. 5 (a) - (b). For S = 50 nm, the main resonant mode\n(mode 1) corresponds to the in-phase precession of majority of the dots in the array apart from the dots\nnear the edges. The intensities of the dots increase from the edge to the centre of the array. The lower\nfrequency peak (mode 2), on the other hand, shows that the dots in the consecutive columns precess outof-phase, while the dots in the alternative columns precess in-phase. The intensity again shows small\nvariation from the edge to the centre of the array. The spatial variation of the phase of precession of the\ndots is similar to the magnetostatic backward volume modes with the wave-vector parallel to the bias\nmagnetic field (H) and both lie within the plane of the sample. For S = 200 nm, the single resonant mode\n(mode 1) corresponds to the precession of the individual dots and hence all of them have identical\namplitude and phase. For comparison we have calculated the amplitude and phase maps of the only\nresonant mode of a single 50 nm wide dot (Figs. 5(c) \u2013 (e)) with different cell size ((c): 2.5 \u00d7 2.5 \u00d7 20\nnm3, (d): 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 20 nm3, and (e): 2.5 \u00d7 2.5 \u00d7 5 nm3), which is found to be the edge mode22, 35, 38 that\noccupies the major fraction of the volume of the dot. Important to note that the mode structure remains\nindependent on the chosen cell size. A closer view to the central dot of the array with S = 200 nm shows\n(Fig. 5(f)) an identical mode structure to that of the single dot, ensuring that in this array the dynamics is\ndominated by that of the single dot.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn summary, we have detected the picosecond precessional dynamics in arrays of 50 nm\npermalloy dots down to the single nanodot regime by an all-optical time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr\neffect microscope. The inter-dot separation (S) varies from 200 nm down to 50 nm and numerical\n9\n\n\fcalculation of magnetostatic fields shows a transition from magetostatically isolated regime to strongly\ncoupled regime as S decreases. Consequently, we observe a single precessional mode for S down to 75\nnm, whose frequency increases with the decrease in S. This has been analytically modeled by\nintroducing the dipolar and quadrupolar contributions to the precession frequency. At the smallest\nseparation S = 50 nm, we observe a splitting of the resonant mode and a lower frequency mode appears\nin addition to the existing mode. Micromagnetic simulations reproduce the above observations\nqualitatively. Analyses of amplitude and phase maps of the resonant modes reveal that the dynamics of a\nsingle dot with 50 nm width is dominated by the edge mode. In sparsely packed arrays (S \u2265 150 nm) we\nprimarily observe the isolated dynamics of the constituent dots, all in phase. For S = 50 nm, the observed\nmodes correspond to the uniform collective precession of the array (higher frequency mode) and an outof-phase precession of the alternative columns of the array parallel to the bias field (lower frequency\nmode). The damping also shows significant variation with the areal density. For S = 200 nm i.e., in the\nsingle nanodot regime, the damping is minimum at about 0.023, which is slightly higher than the\ndamping coefficient (0.017) of a permalloy thin film of same thickness. We understand this slight\nincrease in damping is a result of the defects introduced in the dots during nanofabrication. However,\nthe damping increases further with the decrease in S as a result of the dynamic dephasing of the\nprecession of the weakly interacting dots. At S = 50 nm, the dephasing due to the superposition of two\nresonant modes results in a sudden increase in the apparent damping of the precession. The ability of alloptical detection of the picosecond dynamics of 50 nm dots down to the single nanomagnet regime and\nunderstanding of the effects of magnetostatic interaction on those dots when placed in a dense array will\nbe important from fundamental scientific viewpoint as well as for their future applications in various\nnanomagnetic devices.\n\nMETHODS\nSquare arrays of permalloy dots were prepared by a combination of electron beam evaporation\nand electron-beam lithography. A bilayer PMMA (poly methyl methacrylate) resist pattern was first\n10\n\n\fprepared on thermally oxidized Si(100) substrate by using electron-beam lithography and permalloy was\ndeposited on the resist pattern by electron-beam evaporation at a base pressure of about 2 \u00d7 10-8 Torr. A\n10 nm thick SiO2 capping layer was deposited on top of permalloy to protect the dots from degradation\nwhen exposed to the optical pump-probe experiments in air. This is followed by the lifting off of the\nsacrificial material and oxygen plasma cleaning of the residual resists that remained even after the liftoff process.\nThe ultrafast magnetization dynamics was measured by using a home-built time-resolved\nmagneto-optical Kerr effect microscope based upon a two-color collinear pump-probe set-up. The\nsecond harmonic (\u03bb = 400 nm, pulse width ~ 100 fs) of a Ti-sapphire laser (Tsunami, SpectraPhysics,\npulse-width ~ 80 fs) was used to pump the samples, while the time-delayed fundamental (\u03bb = 800 nm)\nlaser beam was used to probe the dynamics by measuring the polar Kerr rotation by means of a balanced\nphoto-diode detector, which completely isolates the Kerr rotation and the total reflectivity signals. The\npump power used in these measurements is about 8 mW, while the probe power is much weaker and is\nabout 1.5 mW. The probe beam is focused to a spot size of 800 nm and placed at the centre of each array\nby a microscope objective with numerical aperture N. A. = 0.65 and a closed loop piezoelectric scanning\nx-y-z stage. The pump beam is spatially overlapped with the probe beam after passing through the same\nmicroscope objective in a collinear geometry. Consequently, the pump spot is slightly defocused (spot\nsize ~ 1 \u03bcm) on the sample plane, which is also the focal plane of the probe spot. The probe spot is\nplaced at the centre of the pump spot as shown in Fig. 1(b). A large magnetic field is first applied at a\nsmall angle (~ 15\u00b0) to the sample plane to saturate its magnetization. The magnetic field strength is then\nreduced to the bias field value (H = component of bias field along x-direction), which ensures that the\nmagnetization remains saturated along the bias field direction. The bias field was tilted 15\u00b0 out of the\nplane of the sample to have a finite demagnetizing field along the direction of the pump pulse, which is\neventually modified by the pump pulse to induce precessional magnetization dynamics within the dots.\nThe pump beam was chopped at 2 kHz frequency and a phase sensitive detection of the Kerr rotation\nwas used.\n11\n\n\fAcknowledgement The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial supports from Department of\nScience and Technology, Government of India under the grant numbers SR/NM/NS-09/2007,\nSR/FTP/PS-71/2007, INT/EC/CMS (24/233552) and INT/JP/JST/P-23/09 and Japan Science and\nTechnology Agency Strategic International Cooperative Program under the grant numbers 09158876.\n\nREFERENCES AND NOTES\n\n1.
