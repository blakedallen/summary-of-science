VOLBERG, P. YUDITSKII\n\nAbstract. We consider the Jacobi matrix generated by a balanced measure\nof hyperbolic polynomial map. The conjecture of Bellissard says that this\nmatrix should have an extremely strong periodicity property. We show how\nthis conjecture is related to a certain noncommutative version of Bowen\u2013Ruelle\ntheory, and how the two weight Hilbert transform naturally appears in this\ncontext.\n\n1. Introduction and Main results\nLet f be an expanding polynomial with real Julia set J(f ), deg f = N . We recall\nthat J(f ) is a nonempty compact set of points which do not go to infinity under\nforward iterations of f . Under the normalization\nf \u22121 : [\u2212\u03be, \u03be] \u2192 [\u2212\u03be, \u03be]\nsuch a polynomial is well defined by position of its critical values\n{ti = f (ci ) : f \u2032 (ci ) = 0, ci > cj for i > j}.\nExpanding, or hyperbolic polynomials are those, for which\nci \u2208\n/ J(f ), \u2200i .\nThe term \"expanding\" is deserved because for expanding polynomials one has the\nfollowing inequality\n(1)\n\n\u2203Q > 1, |(f n )\u2032 (x)| \u2265 cQn , \u2200x \u2208 J(f ) .\n\nHere and in everything that follows f n means n-th iteration of f , f n = f \u25e6 f \u25e6 ....f .\nWe will always use letter T for polynomial f n , deg T = N n . We will always use\nletter d for this degree, d = N n .\nWe will say that f is sufficiently hyperbolic if\n\u2200i dist(f (ci ), J(f )) \u2265 A ,\nwith a sufficiently large A.\nLet us mention that for f with a real Julia set one has |f (ci )| > \u03be since all\nsolutions of f (x) = \u00b1\u03be should be real.\nPartially supported by NSF grant DMS-0200713, the grant for IAS and the Austrian Science\nFound FWF, project number: P16390\u2013N04.\nAMS subject classification codes: 42B20, 42C15, 42A50, 47B35, 47B38.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nA. VOLBERG, P. YUDITSKII\n\nWe recall now Perron-Frobenius-Ruelle (PFR) theorem in a form convenient for\nus. Let \u03c6 be a Hol(\u03b1) function on J(f ). We define the Perron-Frobenius-Ruelle\n(PFR) operator\nL\u03c6 = L\u03c6,f : C(J(f )) \u2192 C(J(f ))\nas follows\n\nL\u03c6 \u03c8(x) :=\n\nX\n\ne\u03c6(\u03bb) \u03c8(\u03bb) .\n\n\u03bb:f (\u03bb)=x\n\nPFR theorem states that if \u03c1 denotes the spectral radius of this operator then\nZ\n\u03c1\u2212n Ln\u03c6 \u03c8(x) \u2192 h(x) \u03c8(y)d\u03bd(y) ,\n\nwhere h is the unique eigenvector of L\u03c6 with eigenvalue \u03c1, \u03bd is is the unique eigenvector of L\u2217\u03c6 with eigenvalue \u03c1. Moreover, h is H\u00f6lder continuous if \u03c6 is H\u00f6lder\ncontinuous.\nLet us emphasize that the requirement on f is just to be expanding (hyperbolic).\nWe reformulate this result now. Or, rather we will formulate its essential part\nin a different form. In fact, it turns out that at the heart of this result lies the\nfollowing theorem. See [6], for example.\nTheorem 1.1. Let f be hyperbolic. Let \u03c6 \u2208 Hol\u03b1 (J(f )), \u03c8 \u2208 Hol\u03b1 (J(f )), then\nthere exist C < \u221e, q \u2208 (0, 1), \u03b3 > 0 (all depending only on \u03b1) such that\n(2)\n\nLn\u03c6 \u03c8(x1 ) Ln\u03c6 \u03c8(x2 )\n\u2212 n\n\u2264 C q n |x1 \u2212 x2 |\u03b3 .\nLn\u03c6 1(x1 )\nL\u03c6 1(x2 )\n\nConsider the operator G\u03c6 = G\u03c6,f acting on probability measures on J(f ) by the\nformula\nL\u2217\u03c6 \u03bc\nL\u2217\u03c6 \u03bc\nG\u03c6 \u03bc =\n=\n.\nkL\u2217\u03c6 \u03bck\nh1, L\u2217\u03c6 \u03bci\nThen (2) means\n(3)\n\n|h\u03c8, Gn\u03c6 \u03b4x1 i \u2212 h\u03c8, Gn\u03c6 \u03b4x2 i| \u2264 C q n |x1 \u2212 x2 |\u03b3 .\n\nThis is for any test function \u03c8 \u2208 Hol\u03b1 (J(f )), under assumption that \u03c6 \u2208 Hol\u03b1 (J(f )).\nIn what follows \u03c6 will have the following form\n\u03c6 := \u2212t log |f \u2032 | , t \u2208 R .\n\nExample. When t = 0 we have that Gn \u03b4x is a sum of delta measures with charges\n1/d = 1/N n located at all T -preimages of x. We would like to understand the PFR\ntheorem as a consequence of a certain fact of noncommutative nature. Sometimes\nthis is indeed so, we can prove this. We would like to prove this noncommutative\nfact always, for all hyperbolic dynamics, but we can manage only a weaker estimate.\nTo explain what noncommutative proposition we have in mind, let us notice\nthat there is a natural operator for which Gn\u03c6 \u03b4x is a spectral measure. This is just\nJacobi matrix built by this probability measure. Let us recall that to built the\nJacobi matrix by a probability measure d\u03bc(\u03bb) with support on the real line, one\njust orthogonalizes polynomials with respect to this measure, and Jacobi matrix\nis the matrix of multiplication by independent variable \u03bb written in the basis of\northonormal polynomials.\n\n\fPERRON-FROBENIUS-RUELLE THEOREM AND TWO WEIGHT HILBERT TRANSFORM 3\n\nSo let T = f n , deg T = d = N n , J(x) = JT (x) be a Jacobi matrix built by\nmeasure\n\u03bcx = Gn\u03c6,f \u03b4x = G\u03c6,T \u03b4x ,\nwhere \u03c6 = \u2212t log |f \u2032 | (as always in what follows).\nWe already explained that J(x) is canonically defined. Another way to define\nJ(x) : Cd \u2192 Cd is to write\nZ\nd\nX\nd\u03bcx (\u03bb)\ne\u03c6(\u03bbk )\n\u22121\nh(z \u2212 J(x) e0 , e0 i =\n,\n=\u03c3\nz\u2212\u03bb\nz \u2212 \u03bbk\nk=1\n\nwhere \u03bb1 (x), ...., \u03bbd (x) are all T -preimages of x .\nWe can consider J(x) as a result of applying PFR operator to 1 \u00d7 1 matrix x. We\nwant to prove the following claim, which deserves to be called a noncommutative\nPerron-Frobenius-Ruelle (PFR) theorem.\n(4)\n\nkJ(x1 ) \u2212 J(x2 )k \u2264 C q n |x1 \u2212 x2 |\u03b3 .\n\nWe cannot prove (4) for all hyperbolic f and all \u03c6. But here are our main results.\nTheorem 1.2. Let f be hyperbolic. Let x1 , x2 \u2208 J(f ). Let T = f n , we build\nJ(x) = JT (x) using \u03c6 = \u2212t log |f \u2032 | , 0 \u2264 t \u2264 2. Then there exists C such that\nindependently of n\n(5)\n\nkJ(x1 ) \u2212 J(x2 )k \u2264 C|x1 \u2212 x2 | .\n\nTheorem 1.3. Let f be sufficiently hyperbolic. Let x1 , x2 \u2208 J(f ). Let T = f n , we\nbuild J(x) = JT (x) using \u03c6 = 0. Then there exists c < 1 such that independently\nof n\n(6)\n\nkJ(x1 ) \u2212 J(x2 )k \u2264 cn |x1 \u2212 x2 | .\n\nAcknowledgements.

The first author acknowledge with deep\ngratitude the grant from IAS that allowed to use the stimulating atmosphere of this\ninstitution.\n2. PFR theorem from noncommutative PFR theorem\nThis uniform closeness of operators quite easily imply the type of weak closeness of Theorem 1.1, (2) or (3). We just use the fact that measures in, say, (3),\nare spectral measures of J(xi ), and we use the Jackson-Bernstein type theorem\nto approximate the H\u00f6lder continuous function \u03c8 by functions holopmorphic in\nnarrowing neighborhoods of J(f ) with the speed \u03b5\u03c4 , where \u03b5 is the width of a\nneighborhood, and \u03c4 depends on \u03b1 in H\u00f6lder property of \u03c8. This is very standard,\nand it shows that really PFR theorem can be considered as a consequence of a\nnoncommutative claim-(4).\n3. Faybusovich\u2013Gehktman flow\nLet J(x) = JT (x), T = f n , and we think now that n is large but fixed, and we\nare heading towards the proof of Theorem 1.2 with constant independent of n. If we\nthink that x is the time, then the flow of Jacobi matrices J(x) of size d\u00d7d (d = N n )\ncan be treated alike the Toda flow. But unlike the Toda flow, the spectrum sp(J(x))\n\n\f4\n\nA. VOLBERG, P. YUDITSKII\n\nis not time independent, that is, it is not x-independent. This brings a modification\nto the equation of Toda flow. Such modifications were considered by Faybusovich\nand Gehktman in [9], we grateful to M. Shapiro who indicated this to us. Let ()*\ndenote the differentiation with respect to \"time\" x. We write J instead of J(x) for\nbrevity. Recall that in the standard basis e0 , e1 , ...., ed\u22121 of Cd the matrix of J is\nthree diagonal. Recall that sp(J) is always equal \u03bb1 (x), ...., \u03bbd (x) (all T -preimages\nof x). If g is a continuous function on this spectrum, we know what is g(J) by\nfunctional calculus of self-adjoint operators. We need one more definition. Given\nx we consider the orthonormal polynomials P0 (\u03bb; x) = 1, P1 (\u03bb; x), ..., Pd\u22121 (\u03bb; x)\nof degrees 0, 1, ..., d \u2212 1 correspondingly. They are orthonormal with respect to\nmeasure\nd\nX\nd\u03bcx (\u03bb) := \u03c3\ne\u03c6(\u03bbk (x) \u03b4\u03bbk (x) ,\nk=1\n\nwhere from now on always \u03c6 = \u2212t log |f \u2032 |, 1/\u03c3 =\n\nPd\n\nk=1\n\ne\u03c6(\u03bbk (x) .\n\nTheorem 3.1. Our J(x) satisfies the nonlinear ODE\n(7)\n\nJ * = F (J) + [G, J] ,\n\nwhere F (J) is a function of a self-adjoint operator J = J(x) with function F :=\n(T \u2032 )\u22121 on sp(J). Operator G is skew self-adjoint, and its matrix in the standard\nbasis has upper triangular part G\u2212 equal to\n1\nG\u2212 = (DF (J) + \u03c6\u2032 (J)F (J))\u2212 .\n2\nFinally operator D is given by the formula\n\n(8)\n\n(9)\n\nhD\u2217 ek , em i := \u03c3\n\nd\nX\n\ne\u03c6(\u03bbk (x) Pk\u2032 (\u03bbi (x))Pm (\u03bbi (x)) .\n\nk=1\n\nThe form of D will allow to prove\nTheorem 3.2.\n(10)\n\n[J, D] = I \u2212 c * h*, F \u22121 e0 ied\u22121 .\n\nAnd therefore\n(11)\n\n[J, DF ]e = F e, \u2200e orthogonal to e0 .\n\nIn Toda flow F = 0 and G\u2212 = R(J)\u2212 for a certain function R. Here we are in a\nmore complicated situation, but let us observe\n(12)\n\nkF (J)k \u2264 Cq n , q < 1 .\n\nIn fact, just use (1). Then if x \u2208 J(f ) we have sp(J) \u2282 J(f ) and (1) implies\nautomatically the latter inequality (12). If x is not on J(f ), but is separated from\nthe critical values of T , inequality (1) also holds on T -preimages of x, and this set\nis exactly sp(J).\nIt is very good that F (J) is small as in (12) because to prove Theorem 1.2 it is\nhence enough to prove\nTheorem 3.3.\n(13)\n\nk[G, J]k \u2264 C ,\n\n\fPERRON-FROBENIUS-RUELLE THEOREM AND TWO WEIGHT HILBERT TRANSFORM 5\n\nwhere C is independent of n. Then automatically\n(14)\n\nkJ * k \u2264 C \u2032 .\n\nRemark. We cannot prove that G is uniformly bounded, moreover this looks to\nbe false.\n4. Uniform boundedness of the commutator\nWe postpone the explanation of Theorem 3.1. Now we will take it for granted,\nand we prove Theorem 3.3, which of course immediately gives the first main result-\nTheorem 1.2.\nLet\n1\nH := DF (J) + \u03c6\u2032 (J)F (J) .\n2\nLet us adopt the following convention. If we write\nA = B + small ,\nwe always mean that the small term is at most Cq n , with q < 1 in norm.\nThen, for every x\n[G, J] = three diaginal + small ,\njust see (7), (12).\nThis means that to prove the uniform boundedness of the commutator is the\nsame as to prove the uniform boundedness of its matrix elements in the standard\nbasis. Moreover, it is enough to prove the uniform boundedness of \"three diagonal\"\nelements only:\n|h[G, J]em , em\u22121 i|, |h[G, J]em , em i|, |h[G, J]em\u22121 , em i| .\nMoreover the skew symmetry of G implies that [G, J] is self-adjoint, so only the\nfirst and the second type of elements should be checked.\nRecall that the upper triangular parts coincide:\nG\u2212 = H\u2212 .\nLet us denote the diagonal elements of J by a0 = a0 (x), ..., ad\u22121 = ad\u22121 (x), and let\nbelow diagonal elements be b1 = b1 (x), ..., bd\u22121 = bd\u22121 (x).\nLet us write the following equalities (G+ is the lower triangular part of skew\nsymmetric G)\nh[G, J]em , em\u22121 i = h[G\u2212 , J]em , em\u22121 i + h[G+ , J]em , em\u22121 i = h[G\u2212 , J]em , em\u22121 i .\nIn fact using only the lower triangular property of G+ we see that G+ Jem \u2208\nspan(em , ...) and so is orthogonal to em\u22121 . Also, G+ em \u2208 span(em+1 , ...) and so is\northogonal to Jem\u22121 .\nNow we conclude that\nh[G, J]em , em\u22121 i = h[H\u2212 , J]em , em\u22121 i = h[H, J]em , em\u22121 i\u2212\nh[H0 , J]em , em\u22121 i \u2212 h[H+ , J]em , em\u22121 i ,\n\nwhere H+ is the lower triangular part of H = DF + \u03c6\u2032 (J)F , and H0 is its diagonal\npart (that may exist because nobody said that H is skew symmetric). We claim\nthat this means\n(15)\n\nh[G, J]em , em\u22121 i = \u2212h[H0 , J]em , em\u22121 i + small .\n\n\f6\n\nA. VOLBERG, P. YUDITSKII\n\nIn fact, the last term h[H+ , J]em , em\u22121 i equals zero\u2013we checked this for any lower\ntriangular matrix. On the other hand, the term h[H, J]em , em\u22121 i is equal to h[DF +\n\u03c6\u2032 (J)F (J), J]em , em\u22121 i = h[DF, J]em , em\u22121 i = \u2212hF em , em\u22121 i. The last equality\nfollows from (11). So this term is small in our sense, and (15) is proved.\nWe can now use\nJem = bm em\u22121 + am em + bm+1 em+1\nto plug it into (15) and get it rewritten\n(16)\n\nh[G, J]em , em\u22121 i = bm hHem , em i \u2212 bm\u22121 hHem\u22121 , em\u22121 i + small .\n\nWe can also calculate h[G, J]em , em i.\n(17)\n\nh[G, J]em , em i = 2bm+1 hHem , em+1 i \u2212 2bm hHem\u22121 , em i + small .\n\nIn fact, skew symmetry of G implies h[G, J]em , em i = 2h[G\u2212 , J]em , em i = 2h[H\u2212 , J]em , em i.\nAgain replace H\u2212 by H \u2212 H0 \u2212 H+ . Then\nh[G, J]em , em i = 2h[H, J]em , em i\u22122h[H0 , J]em , em i\u22122h[H+ , J]em , em i =: 2A\u22122B\u22122C .\nObviously B = 0. To see that A = small let us use (10): [J, D]F e = F e \u2212 c *\nhF e, F \u22121 e0 ied\u22121 . In other words [J, DF ]em = F em \u2212c*hem , e0 id\u22121 . But we saw that\n[H, J] = [DF, J]. Therefore A = h[H, J]em , em i = small for any m = 0, 1, ..., d \u2212 1.\nWe are left to see what is C.\nC = hH+ Jem , em i \u2212 hH+ em , Jem i =\nhH+ (bm em\u22121 + am em + bm+1 em+1 ), em i \u2212 hH+ em , bm em\u22121 + am em + bm+1 em+1 i =\nbm hH+ em\u22121 , em i \u2212 bm+1 hH+ em , em+1 i .\n\nIn both expressions here one can replace H+ by H without changing these scalar\nproducts. So (17) is proved.\nFrom (16) and (17) it follows that the estimate of the norm of the commutator\n[G, J] follows from the estimate of operator H = DF (J) + 12 \u03c6\u2032 (J)F (J).\nIf we can prove the uniform boundedness of H, we can prove, therefore, Theorem\n3.3 and, thus Theorem 1.2.\n5. The uniform boundedness of H = DF (J) + 12 \u03c6\u2032 (J)F (J). Two weight\nHilbert transform\nTo prove the uniform boundedness of H we need to understand D better. To do\nthis we will write H in a different basis, and we will see that DF becomes a two\nweight Hilbert transform (almost). Then we use our knowledge of the boundedness\nof two weight Hilbert transform. This will prove the uniform boundedness of H,\nand, as a result, will prove Theorem 3.3 and Theorem 1.2.\nWe already introduced polynomials orthonormal with respect to \u03bcx .

The first formula is obvious as the unitary (it is even orthogonal) matrix P\ntransforms J into its diagonal form \u039b.

VOLBERG, P. YUDITSKII\n\nThis and (23) will finish the lemma. To prove (24) let us notice that denoting\n\uf8ee \uf8f9\nv1\n\uf8ef .. \uf8fa\n\u22121\nc * P ed\u22121 = \uf8f0 . \uf8fb\nvd\n\n\u2217\n\nwe obtain from (23) and the form of P e0 that\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\nv1 , ..., v1\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n..\n[\u039b, R] = F (\u039b) \u2212 \uf8f0\n\uf8fb\n.\nvd , ..., vd\n\nBut \u039b is diagonal, and so the diagonal of the LHS vanishes. But this gives us vi =\n1\ni-th diagonal element of F (\u039b), which is T \u2032 (\u03bb\n. So (24) is proved, and lemma is\ni)\nshown.\n\u0003\nRecall that\nR := P \u22121 DF P .\nLemma 5.2.

On the other hand\n\uf8ee \uf8f9\n1\n\u2217 \uf8ef .. \uf8fa\nR \uf8f0.\uf8fb = 0 .\n1\n\nIn fact,\n\n\uf8ee \uf8f9\n\uf8ee \uf8f9\n1\n1\n\u2217 \uf8ef .. \uf8fa\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217 \u22121 \uf8ef .. \uf8fa\nR \uf8f0 . \uf8fb = P F D (P ) \uf8f0 . \uf8fb ,\n1\n\nBut we know that\n\n1\n\n\uf8ee \uf8f9\n1\n\u2217 \u22121 \uf8ef .. \uf8fa\n(P ) \uf8f0 . \uf8fb = e0 ,\n1\n\nand D\u2217 e0 = 0 (from (3.2)).

We will just choose the result convenient for our narrow purpose here.\nA paper [14] looks like specially written for the occasion. However, the reader\nwho wants to familiarize her/himself with two weighted estimates is referred to\n[16] and to the vast literature cited there. We just make two remarks. First one is\nthat the two weight estimates for operators with positive kernels is more or less well\nunderstood due to the works of Eric Sawyer (many of them are cited in [16]). On the\nother hand the singular kernel two weight estimates are not completely understood\neven for the simplest singular kernels (like the Hilbert transform). There is only\none kernel\u2013the dyadic singular kernel corresponding to the Martingale transform,\nwhere the technique of Bellman function gives a full criterion of boundedness. See\n[13]. There is no \"classical\" approach to this so far. And if kernel becomes just\nslightly more complicated than the dyadic one (for example the Hilbert transform)\nthere is no real understanding. (The criterion of Cotlar-Sadosky [7] is very nice\nbut its language seems to be not applicable here.) Some criterion which \"seems\nto be\" the right one is considered in the last two chapters of [16]. There are some\ncounterexamples to other \"right criteria\" in [12].\nBut we have to find a certain applicable and easily verifiable sufficient condition\nof two weight boundedness of the Hilbert transform. The question is very intimately\nrelated to a so-called problem of Sarason: describe when the product of two Toeplitz\noperators is bounded. Dechao Zheng found a wonderful sufficient condition in [8].\nIt was then adopted in [14] to two weight Hilbert transform. One of the main\nresults of [14] will be applied here-it is perfect for our goals.\nLet\nR us introduce notations. The symbol hf iI will denote the usual averaging\nI f dx, where I is an interval on a real line. The symbol PI f denotes the\nR\nPoisson averaging, namely, \u03c01 R (x\u2212c)|I|\n2 +|I|2 f (x) dx, where c is the center of I. In\nother words it is the value of the Poisson extension of f at the point c + i * |I| \u2208 C+ .\nWe prove Theorem 5.4 if we prove the following result.\n\u0003\n1\n|I|\n\nTheorem 5.5.

If for every interval I we have\n(28)\n\nPI g(u) * PI g(v) \u2264 C\n\nwith C < \u221e independent of I, then the two weight Hilbert transform\nHudx : L2 (udx) \u2192 L2 (vdx)\nis bounded, and its norm depends only on C < \u221e and \u03b5 > 0.\n\n\fPERRON-FROBENIUS-RUELLE THEOREM AND TWO WEIGHT HILBERT TRANSFORM 11\n\nRemark. The reader may wonder why we need the gauge function g here? It\nturns out that PI u * PI v \u2264 C is not sufficient for the boundedness of the Hilbert\ntransform in general.

We call the interval the interval I\ndyadic if there exists m, 0 \u2264 m \u2264 n such that I = a component of (f m )\u22121 ([\u22121, 1]).\nSuch intervals form the set Dm of dyadic intervals of rank m.

Let Jn (f ) := \u222ai\u2208Dn I. If for any interval I0 \u2282 [\u22121, 1] such that\nI0 \u2229 Jn (f ) 6= \u2205 we would have that there exists a \"dyadic\" interval of comparable\nlength that contains I0 \u2229 Jn (f ), then (40) for I = I0 would follow from (40) for\n\"dyadic\" intervals. For usual dyadic intervals this is of course false. It is obvious\nthat one cannot always find the dyadic interval of comparable length containing a\ngiven interval. But in our situation this is true.\nLemma 5.10. Let I0 \u2282 [\u22121, 1] such that I0 \u2229 Jn (f ) 6= \u2205. Let I denote the smallest\ninterval from D containing I0 \u2229 Jn (f ). Then\n(42)\n\n|I0 | \u2265 c * |I| ,\n\nwhere c > 0 depends only on hyperbolicity of f .\nProof. Along with dyadic intervals D1 we have the collection of gap intervals G1\nbetween them. Preimages of intervals of G1 give gaps Gk , k = 2, ..., n. Take our\nI0 . Let J be a gap interval inside it. If there is none then I0 \u2229 Jn (f ) coincides\nwith one interval of Dn . And (42) holds. So let J \u2282 I0 of the smallest generation\nk = 1, ..., n. J \u2208 Gk . Then it lies in a dyadic interval I \u2208 Dk\u22121 . Let us prove that\n(43)\n\nI0 \u2229 Jn (f ) \u2282 I ,\n\nInterval I has one or two neighbors of generation k \u2212 1 or smaller generation m <\nk \u2212 1. If (43) is false then I0 should intersect one of these neighbors. But then it\nshould contain the gap of generation l \u2264 k \u2212 1. This contradicts the choice of J.\nSo (43) holds.\nOne of the branches of f \u2212(k\u22121) maps [\u22121, 1] onto I. Call this branch gk\u22121 .\nMoreover, univalently\ngk\u22121 : U \u2192 UI ,\n\nwhere U is an open topological disc containing [\u22121, 1], and I \u2282 UI .

Consider first the case: there exists l \u2208 Jn (f ) such that\nI \u2229 l 6= \u2205. Such an I can be \"big\" or small\". Big means C * I contains an interval\nof l.

For a fixed sequence \u01eb0 , \u01eb1 ...,\n \u0303 Tm \u25e6 ... \u25e6 T2 \u25e6 T1 ).\n0 \u2264 \u01ebk \u2264 dk+1 , define Jm = J(\u01eb0 + \u01eb1 d1 + ... + \u01ebm\u22121 d1 ...dm\u22121 , J;\n \u0303 Moreover,\nThen J = limm\u2192\u221e Jm exists and does not depend of J.\n\u2200j, ||J \u2212 S \u2212d1 ...dl j JS d1 ...dlj || \u2264 Acl , A > 0.\nThat is \u03c1J defines on Z the standard p\u2013adic topology in this case.\nNotice that for the case T1 = T2 = ... = Tm =: T , T = f n , d1 = ... = N n =: d\nwe just get\n(53)\n\nl\n\nl\n\n\u2200j, ||J \u2212 S \u2212d j JS d j || \u2264 Acl , A > 0 .\n\nThis proves that J is a limit periodic matrix (so, in particular) it is almost periodic.\nThis provides the bridge between Lipschitz or (better) contractivity property of our\nnoncommutative PFR operator and the question of almost periodicity of a wide\nclass of Jacobi matrix generated by hyperbolic dynamical systems.\n\n\f19\n\nReferences\n[1] J.
