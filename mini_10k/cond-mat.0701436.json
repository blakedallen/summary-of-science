Gd\n\nRecent advances in the fabrication of single graphene\nsheets as well as the striking initial experiments on the\nrelativistic quantum Hall effect in graphene [1, 2] have\ngenerated intense interest in this remarkable material.\nMost of the theoretical and experimental research has focused on the properties of the low energy excitations close\nto half filling which have a Dirac spectrum with a speed\nof light of the order of 106 m/s. The spin-unpolarized\nquantum Hall effect shows a sequence of plateaus at\n2\n\u03c3xy = (n + 12 ) \u00d7 4 eh consistent with the existence of\ntwo Dirac cones as well as a spin degeneracy [1, 2].\nThe phenomenon of Hall conductivity quantization is\nhowever not restricted to two dimensions and can occur\nin bulk samples, albeit under more stringent conditions.\nIt was first observed by Halperin [3] that for a threedimensional (3D) electron system in a periodic potential,\nif the Fermi level lies inside an energy gap, the conductivity tensor is necessarily of the form:\n\u03c3ij =\n\ne2\n\u01eb G\n2\u03c0h ijk k\n\n(1)\n\n~ is a\nwhere \u01ebijk is the fully antisymmetric tensor and G\nreciprocal lattice vector of the potential which may or\nmay not be zero. The periodic potential can be generated\nby either an underlying lattice or spontaneously by manybody effects through the formation of density waves.\nThe existence of the three dimensional quantum Hall\neffect (3DQHE) has not, however, been observed in any\nbulk materials, although the effect has been observed in\nstacked superlattices of 2D semiconductor layers, each\nexhibiting a 2DQHE, where the inter-layer tunneling is\nengineered away [4]. The only current bulk material candidates for 3DQHE are the Bechgaard salts [5, 6]. The\ndifficulty inherent in realizing the 3DQHE in a specific\nbulk material can be understood by considering the spectrum of an electron in a periodic potential under an applied magnetic field. In 2D, this Hofstadter problem [7]\nresults in magnetic energy bands. Associated with each\n\nFIG. 1: (a) Graphite in Bernal stacking. (b) Under strong\nmagnetic field, graphite is gapped in the bulk and exhibits\nchiral surface sheet states. (c) Idealized Brillouin zone for\ngraphite. (d) Predicted 3D Hall conductivity, quantized in\nunits of 1/c0 . Only one plateau is observable in graphite.\n\nband is an integer quantized Hall conductance; when the\nFermi level lies in a gap, the observed Hall conductance\nis a sum over the contributions from each filled band. In\n3D, the momentum component parallel to the magnetic\nfield disperses freely and the very existence of such gaps\nis not guaranteed; indeed it is exceptional. Tilting the\nmagnetic field away from the crystallographic axes helps\n[8], but does not guarantee, the opening of gaps.\nIn this paper we show that a true, bulk 3DQHE is\nrealized in graphite under a large magnetic field parallel to the c-axis. Three factors conspire to render this\npossible: the large Landau gap of the integer quantum\nHall state in graphene, the weak interplane hopping, and\nthe Bernal stacking. We first give a physical argument\nfor the existence of 3DQHE based on adiabatic continuity, then perform a full Hofstadter calculation in 3D\nof the band and surface states structure, using the realistic Johnson-Dresselhaus [9, 10] Hamiltonian for graphite,\nplus a magnetic field. We find the minimum magnetic\n\n\f2\n\nFIG. 2: Spectrum of the zero mode and first few Landau\nlevels of our toy model in B = 10 T interpolated between\ngraphene (x = 0), where they do not kz disperse, and graphite\n(x = 1). The zero mode (blue) is doubly degenerate, giving\n2\na 3D Hall conductance of eh c10 per independent K point per\nspin.\n\nfield necessary for a 3DQHE to be 15.4 T for electrons\nand 7.0 T for holes, and show that only one Hall plateau\n(Fig. 1) will be observed due to band closing in the higher\nLandau levels (LLs). Besides the obvious prediction of a\nplateau in off-diagonal conductive response, we also predict that a correlated chiral surface state [11], occurs at\nthe boundary of the sample. Based on the recent experimental focus on graphite [12] we believe our prediction is\ntestable with current experimental techniques. Previous\nHall plateaus observed in graphite [13, 14] are either even\nin B, or come in multiple sequences consistent with the\ngraphene QHE plateaus [14, 15], and are hence different\nthan our prediction of a single quantized Hall plateau of\nHall conductivity twice as large as the one observed in\ngraphene for Fermi level in the first Landau gap.\nGraphite is a layered material consisting of weakly\ncoupled parallel graphene layers in an ABABAB configuration known as Bernal stacking [16], as depicted\nin Fig. 1. Let us initially set the inter-layer hopping\nto zero and place a large number of uncoupled stacked\ngraphene layers in a strong magnetic field perpendicular\nto their surface. Each layer exhibits a relativistic quantum Hall\u221aEffect as previously described\nwith a LL energy\np\nEn = \u00b1 2n ~v/l, where l = ~c/eB is the magnetic\nlength, n = 0, 1, . . . . and v \u2248 106 m/s. Typical values of\nthe gap are roughly 0.1 eV for B = 10 T and > 0.25 eV for\nB > 40 T, thus making graphene the first system to exhibit quantized Hall conductance at room-temperature.\nIf we place the Fermi level in the first Landau gap, our\nsystem of uncoupled graphene layers trivially exhibits a\n3DQHE, with the bulk enveloped by a sheath of chiral\nsurface states as in Fig. 1. For uncoupled layers, there\n\nis no kz dispersion. We now adiabatically turn on intralayer hopping, which causes almost all LLs to disperse\nwith kz . The exception are the zero modes which are\nstable in an idealized model due to particle-hole symmetry, as we show below. By adiabatic continuity, the\nsheath of chiral states (and hence the 3DQHE) must be\nstable as long as the Landau gap does not collapse.\nWe first show that the statement above is true for\na simplified toy-model of graphite. If we introduce\na parameter x which interpolates between uncoupled\ngraphene layers (x = 0) and graphite (x = 1), the\nminimal Hamiltonian of our system is a 4 \u00d7 4 Hermitian matrix acting on the lattice spinor (\u03c8A , \u03c8B , \u03c8C , \u03c8D ),\nwhere (A,B) and (C,D) are the two inequivalent sites\nof the lower and upper graphene layers in the Bernal\nstacking, respectively. Its nonzero\nindependent ele\u221a\n\u2217\nments are HAB = \u2212HCD\n= 23 tk a0 k\u2212 , and HAC =\n\n\u22122xt\u22a5 cos( 12 kz c0 ). The in-plane hopping is tk = 3.16 eV,\nt\u22a5 = 0.39 eV is the interlayer (A-C) hopping in graphite\n(x = 1) [16], and a0 = 2.456 \u00c5 is the graphene lattice constant (in-plane A-A distance). The c-axis lattice\nconstant is c0 = 6.74 \u00c5 (the distance between consecutive lattice planes equal to 21 c0 ), and k\u00b1 = kx \u00b1 iky .\nThe in-plane dispersion\nis expanded about the point\n\u0001\n4\u03c0\n,\n0,\n0\n,\nwhich\nis\nthe Dirac point in graphene.\nK = 3a\n0\nIn a uniform magnetic field, adopting the symmetric\n~ = 1 B(\u2212y, x, 0), the Kohn-Luttinger substitugauge A\n2\ne\n(Ax \u00b1 iAy ) [17].

(All levels receive\nan additional double degeneracy owing to the existence\nof the inequivalent K point.) The next Landau bands\nare the lowest two energy levels of n = 1. Using this\nspectrum we find that the gap between the zero mode\n\n,\n\n\f3\nand the LL above or below it cannot collapse upon interpolating between x = 0 and x = 1 for any value of\nthe magnetic field. As such, by adiabatic continuity, the\nHall conductance when the Fermi level is in the 3D gap\n(with doubling for the two spins) is:\nZ 3\nD \u2202\u03c8 \u2202\u03c8 E\n4e2\ndk\n\u03c3xy =\n=\nIm\nh (2\u03c0)3\n\u2202kx \u2202ky\nZ\ndkz\n4e2\n4e2\n.\n(4)\n= (2n + 1) \u00d7\n= (2n + 1)\nh\n2\u03c0\nhc0\nFor the Fermi level between the zero mode and the first\nLL, n = 0 and \u03c3xy = \u00b14e2 /hc0 . The Bernal stacking of graphite accounts for the extra factor of 2 relaR d2 k\ntive to graphene and (2\u03c0)\n2 Im h\u2202k \u03c8 | \u2202k \u03c8i = 2n + 1 is\ny\nx\nthe TKNN integer [19] of the relativistic graphene bands\nwhen the Fermi level is placed in the nth bulk gap. We observe that the gap between the first and the second LL in\ngraphite closes for any realistic value of the B field (Fig.\n2), and hence higher n plateaus will not be observed. Zeeman splitting could give rise to a \u03c3xy = 0 plateau, but is\nsmeared by the dispersion of the zero mode in the realistic graphite model used below, and hence the predicted\nHall conductance is sketched in Fig. 1.\nThe existence of a full gap in the 3D LL spectrum is\nan artifact of the toy model involving only tk and t\u22a5 . It\nderives from the presence of a flat, twofold degenerate\nband at the Fermi level along the HK spines of the Brillouin zone. The Bernal stacking is crucial, for if the individual graphene planes were stacked identically, all LLs\nwould acquire a kz -dependent contribution to their energies \u22122t\u22a5 cos(kz c0 ), and would then overlap at all but\nextremely high magnetic fields [20]. More realistic models for graphite, such as the Slonczewski-Weiss-McClure\n(SWMC) model [21, 22] or that of Johnson and Dresselhaus (JD) [9, 10], contain small c-axis B-B (D-D) hopping terms, through the open hexagons of the CD (AB)\nplane. Their value is small on the scale of nearest neighbor hopping \u2013 only 10 meV, leading to a bandwidth of\n40 meV along the HK spine. But the presence of such\nterms is crucial toward understanding the properties of\ngraphite. At B = 0, they result in semimetallic behavior, whereas the toy model incorrectly predicts a zero\ngap semiconductor. For weak fields, they lead to overlap of the LLs and destruction of the QHE. However, as\nwe shall show, the principal gaps surrounding the central\nn = 0 LLs survive for B > 7.0 T (holes) and B > 15.4 T\n(particles). Lightly doped graphite, then, will exhibit a\n3DQHE at these fields. We next describe our solution of\nthe JD model in a magnetic field on a torus and a Laughlin cylinder, finding the LLs and the surface states, and\ndetermining the critical fields Bc at which energy gaps\nopen across the entire Brillouin zone [23].\nThe JD model [9, 10] is a tight-binding Hamiltonian\nderived from the k * p theory of SWMC. Its nine parameters are given in Tab. I. In addition to nearest neigh-\n\nTABLE I: Tight-binding parameters\nParameter meV Parameter meV Parameter meV\nk,1\n\nk,1\n\ntAB = tCD\ntAC\nt\u22a5\nAA\u2032\n\n=\n\nt\u22a5\nCC\u2032\n\nk,2\n\nk,2\n\nk,3\n\nk,3\n\n4200 tAB = tCD 512.5 tAB = tCD\ntBD\n\n\u2212390\n\u221219\n\nt\u22a5\nBB\u2032\n\n=\n\nt\u22a5\nDD\u2032\n\n15\n\n\u2212315 tAD = tBC \u221244\n10\n\n\u2206\n\n50\n\nFIG. 3: Definition of JD hopping matrix elements and flux\nassignment. Sites A and B belong to different graphene layers\nthan sites C and D, and Bernal stacking corresponds to sites\nA and C differing by a c-axis translation.

There is also an energy asymmetry\n\u2206 = \u03b5A(C) \u2212 \u03b5B(D) . We then introduce a magnetic field\nthrough Peierls phases along the links, consistent with all\nrotational (and screw axis) symmetries of the underlying\nlattice, as depicted in Fig. 3.\nWe solve the model through a combination of exact diagonalization, Lanczos method (for q > 1000, where the\nflux per hexagonal plaquette is 1/q Dirac quanta \u03c60 =\nhc/e), and low field expansion. For the bulk band structure, we impose doubly periodic (i.e. toroidal) boundary\nconditions in the (x, y) plane, while to study edge (surface) states we impose singly periodic (i.e. cylindrical)\nboundary conditions. The latter case may also be solved\nvia a transfer matrix formalism [24]. Due to the algebraic\ncomplexity of the problem, we postpone the explicit details of the B-field Hamiltonian and transfer matrix for a\nfuture publication. For q > 20 the Hofstadter broadening\nbecomes negligible and the band energies as a function\nof kx become non-dispersive, corresponding to the real\nsituation in which the magnetic field splitting is small\n\n\f4\n\nFIG. 4: Clockwise from upper left: (a) B = 5 T, no gap\npresent in the full spectrum. (b) B = 12 T, clear gap in the\nhole LL spectrum. (c) B = 20 T clear gaps for both hole and\nelectron LL. Spin-up (blue) and spin-down (red) bands are\nshown. (d) Principal energy gaps surrounding n = 0 LLs,\nincluding effects due to Zeeman splitting. The particle gap\ncollapses at Bce = 15.4 T and the hole gap at Bch = 7.0 T. All\nenergies have been shifted upward by 100 meV.\n\ncompared to the in-plane hopping amplitude.\nWe observe the following characteristics of the spectrum. The zero mode has a dispersion of 40 meV in the\nlow field limit. The first LL, however, disperses strongly\nas a function of kz and for each value of q we scan the\nenergy E(kz ) spectrum to look for the smallest gap. Fig.\n4 shows the bulk Landau Level spectrum for B = 5, 12,\nand 20 Tesla, as well as the field-dependence of the principal gaps surrounding the central, weakly dispersive n = 0\nLLs. We find that both gaps are indirect for B < 30 T. In\nFig. 5 we plot the bulk band and surface state spectrum\nas a function of kx and kz , which proves the existence\nof gaps and surface states over the entire Brillouin zone.\nOn the Laughlin cylinder, for each value of kz , we obtain 2 edge states on each of the upper/lower edge of the\ncylinder. Unlike the low-field bulk LLs, the edge states\ndisperse as a function of kx and cross the bulk gap to give\n2e2 /hc0 per spin. We have checked that our numerical\nresults match the theoretical analysis of the continuum\nk approximation of the JD model.\n\u221a\nAt low fields, each LL accommodates 23 a20 B/4\u03c60 =\n3.16 \u00d7 10\u22126 B [T] states per carbon atom. Accounting\nfor the quadruple degeneracy of the LLs (two K points\nand two spin polarizations), the central n = 0 levels will\nbe filled for fields below 20 T at a doping of only 0.025%.\nFor the lowest field for which we predict the effect, the\ndoping is a modest 0.01%. Unlike in a many-body gap,\nthe Fermi level is not pinned and the width of the LL\n\nFIG. 5: Zero mode, first electron Landau level and surface states spectrum over the full Brillouin zone for one spin\nspecies at B = 40 T. (a) Surface states spectrum (b) Zero\nmode and first electron Landau level spectrum (c) Surface\nstates and bulk Landau levels together. The n = 1 (n = 0)\nlevels are shifted by +0.1 eV (\u22120.1 eV) for clarity. There are\ntwo surface states per spin species crossing the bulk gap.\n\nwill be given by the width of the mobility single-particle\ngap in disordered graphite. Strong disorder leads to wide\nHall plateaus, and weak disorder to narrow ones [25].\nBesides the prediction of a quantized response, the chiral surface sheet should exhibit ballistic in-plane longitudinal response \u03c1xx \u2192 0 as T \u2192 0. Remarkable transport\nproperties are also present along the direction parallel to\nthe magnetic field [11]. In this direction the system is a\nstable metal with a temperature independent resistivity\n\u03c1zz , with a value which can be much larger than h/e2 ,\nalthough, unlike previously predicted [11] we do expect\nthe metallic phase to be unstable to very strong disorder and impurity concentration which levitate the bulk\nextended states above the Fermi level [26].\nIn conclusion, we predict the appearance of one\nplateau of 3D quantized Hall transport in doped bulk\ngraphite under strong magnetic fields parallel to its caxis. We analyzed the Hofstadter problem in graphite\nand estimate the minimum field to be approximately\n7.0 T (for holes) and 15.4 T (for electrons). While our\ngeneral conclusions are robust, differences among material parameters reported in the literature can shift the\ncritical fields by several Tesla. The recent advances and\ninterest in graphene and graphite make our prediction\ntestable with current experimental techniques.\nB. A. B. wishes to thank F.D.M.
