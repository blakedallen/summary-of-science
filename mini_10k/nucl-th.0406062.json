These experiments\nwill be able to measure Gamow-Teller data in the mass\n90-100 region. Extensive theoretical studies have been\ndevoted to Gamow-Teller total strengths and strength\ndistributions in 1s-0d shell nuclei (mass A = 16-40 nuclei) [1] and the 0f -1p shell (mass A = 40-80 nuclei) [2\u20134].\nDue to an excellent agreement between shell model results and the available experimental data, the calculated\nresults have been used extensively to predict numerous\nGamow-Teller strength distributions in nuclei that have\nnot yet become experimentally accessible [5].\nIn addition to their nuclear structure interests, an appropriate description of Gamow-Teller transitions in nuclei directly affects the early phases of type II supernova\ncore collapse since electron capture rates are partly determined by them. The effects of the improved rate estimates are rather dramatic, as was recently discussed in\nRefs. [6, 7]. In addition to the standard Gamow-Teller\ntransitions, first- and second-forbidden transitions contribute to the electron capture rates in the supernova\nenvironment. For terrestrial experiments, the primary\nfocus is on the Gamow-Teller transitions.\nRecently, Zegers et al [8] proposed to measure the\nGamow-Teller distributions using stable Zr and Mo isotopes as targets in (t, 3 He) reactions [9]. Estimates\nindicate that the Gamow-Teller strength is sufficiently\nlarge to be measured. In this paper, we will investigate these transitions using standard shell-model diagonalization techniques for 36 nuclei with the mass number\n90 \u2264 A \u2264 97 (Z = 40-47, N = 50-57). To validate the interaction, we also studied excitation spectra in those and\nother nuclei in the region. Since our model space does\nnot contain all spin-orbit partners, i.e. it is not a complete 0h\u0304\u03c9 calculation, the total Gamow-Teller strength\nwill be overestimated in our calculations. We adopt a\nsingle quenching factor similar to the one discussed in\nRef. [10]. We estimated this factor based on recent experimental data on 97 Ag [11]. We used this measurement\nto gauge our calculation for two reasons. First, it used\n\nthe total absorption spectrometry which accounts also\nfor the weak \u03b3-ray cascades that follow the \u03b2 + decay.\nSecond, almost all total Gamow-Teller strength is inside\nthe Q-window. We note that this factor need not be\nuniversal as it is simply a phenomenological tool at this\npoint.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows.\nIn Section II, we present results on the nuclear spectra,\ngenerated with an effective interaction that uses 88 Sr as\na core, and compare them to experiment. In section III,\nwe present our shell-model diagonalization results for the\nGamow-Teller strength distributions and compare to experiment when available. We also present systematics of\nthe Gamow-Teller centroids. In section IV, we discuss\nthe distributed-memory shell-model computer code that\nwe developed and used for these calculations. Finally, we\nconclude and give a perspective in Section V.\n\nII.\n\nCALCULATED SPECTRA USING THE\nCORE\n\n88\n\nSR\n\nWe perform our shell-model diagonalization calculations in a model space taking 88 Sr as the core nucleus\nand allowing excitations within the valence space of 1p1/2\nand 0g9/2 proton shells and 1d5/2 , 2s1/2 , 1d3/2 , 0g7/2 , and\n0h11/2 neutron shells. While it cannot be used for calculations of \u03b2-decays, it appears suitable for Gamow-Teller\ndistributions in the electron-capture direction. The effective interaction [12] was derived from a CD-Bonn potential [13] using the machinery of many-body perturbation theory [14]. We use the following single-particle\nenergies: \u03b5(p1/2 ) = 0.0 MeV and \u03b5(g9/2 ) = 0.9 MeV\nfor protons; and \u03b5(d5/2 ) = 0.0 MeV, \u03b5(s1/2 ) = 1.26\nMeV, \u03b5(d3/2 ) = 2.23 MeV, \u03b5(g7/2 ) = 2.90 MeV, and\n\u03b5(h11/2 ) = 3.50 MeV for neutrons.

The energy splitting between the lowest states\nwith different parities is reproduced with varying success,\nalthough this is difficult to judge for some nuclei because\nof the lack of experimental information.\nFor representative spectra which indicate the overall\nquality of the interaction, we show nuclei having mass\nA = 96 in Figs. 1-2. The maximum energy range shown\nin the plots is varied following the density of states. From\nthese figures we observe that the spectra of even-even nuclei (96 Pd, 96 Ru, 96 Mo, 96 Zr, and 96 Sr) are reproduced\nwell. For 96 Pd there are more calculated states than experimentally known. In some nuclei the model space is\ninsufficient to describe all observed states. Odd-odd nuclei (96 Rh,96 Tc, 96 Nb, and 96 Y), having more states, are\nalso more difficult to describe although, even here, the\ninteraction performs reasonably well. The position of 8+\nisomer in 96 Y is not known experimentally [17]. This\nstate appears in the calculation at a relatively high excitation energy, 1.1 MeV above the lowest positive parity\nstate which was calculated to be 5+ . The nucleus 96 Tc\nreflects a situation where the lowest states are experimentally very close (in this nucleus there are 6 states in the\nenergy range of 50 keV), while the calculation reproduces\nthe states but not their energies (the calculated range is\n310 keV). A similar situation occurs in 92,94 Nb.\nThese A = 96 nuclei reflect the situation in other cases\nas well, with a general conclusion that the interaction reproduces excitation spectra reasonably well, though fine\ntuning might increase the accuracy.

We judged the agreement based on reproduction of low-lying states up to a chosen excitation\nenergy. For odd-odd isotopes, which have higher density\nof states, the upper limit was chosen to be 1 MeV. For\neven-even nuclei the limit was up to 3 MeV. Not all observed states were found in the model space, as would\n\nOur study focuses on the Gamow-Teller transitions\nfrom the lowest positive parity states which is natural for\nthe most nuclei in the region above 88 Sr, with the exception of the Y isotopes where the odd proton in the p1/2\nshell is responsible for low-lying negative parity states.\nSince our model space is not sufficient to reasonably reproduce negative parity states in Sr isotopes where no\nvalence protons are available, we do not calculate the\ntransitions between these two isotope chains. Among the\ncalculated nuclei, there are three cases where we chose\nthe lowest experimental state to be the initial state for\nGT excitations rather than using our calculated lowest\nenergy state. This affected two N = 51 nuclei, 92 Nb and\n94\nTc, where the calculation places 2+ to be the lowest\nstate, and the nucleus 96 Tc.\nThe Gamow-Teller strength was calculated using the\n\n\f4\nformula\n2\n\nGT+\n\nX\nX\n1\n= h\u03c3\u03c4 i =\nh\u03a8f ||\n\u03c3(k)\u03c4+ (k)||\u03a8i i .\n2Ji + 1\n2\n\nf\n\nk\n\n(1)\nTo obtain the strength distribution, we used the method\nof moments [18]. We performed 33 iterations for each\nJf in all nuclei except for the decays of 97 Mo, where\nwe did 24 iterations per final state, and 97 Ag, where a\ncomplete convergence was achieved. The GT+ strength\ninside the experimental QEC window [19] is marked as\nBQEC . This value is only an estimate, since we did not\nstrive to achieve the convergence of states inside the Qwindow.\nAs discussed above, our calculation overpredicts the\nGamow-Teller strength; thus we include a hindrance factor, h, so that S(GT+ ) = GT+ /h. This factor is found by\ncomparing experimental data to the calculated GamowTeller total strength. For nuclei around 100 Sn, the singleparticle estimate of the Gamow-Teller strength is commonly used, since the main contribution comes from a\ntransition of a g9/2 proton into a g7/2 neutron. The estimate is given by a formula (see e.g. [20]):\n\u0012\n\u0013\nX\nN9/2\nN7/2\nGT+ =\n1\u2212\nGT+ (100 Sn),\n(2)\n10\n8\nwhere N9/2 is the occupation of the g9/2 shell by protons,\nand N7/2 is the occupation of g7/2 shell by neutrons in\nthe initial state of a parent nucleus, and GT+ (100 Sn) =\n17.78 is the single particle estimate of the total GamowTeller strength for 100 Sn. In the simplest, non-interacting\nshell model, the occupation numbers are replaced by the\nnumbers of valence particles in the corresponding shells.\nThis simplest estimate does not exactly reproduce our\ncalculated strength even though the values are close. It\nunderestimates the strength for isotopes below the mass\nA = 96, which is not surprising because our model space\nallows excitations out of the p1/2 shell. On the other\nhand, it overestimates the strength for some isotopes with\nA = 97, which is related to the partial occupation of\nthe g7/2 shell by neutrons reducing the total strength as\ncompared to the non-interacting picture.\nSince our calculated total strength is reasonably close\nto the single-particle estimates, we could use the experimental hindrance factor quoted relative to the singleparticle estimate: hexp = GTsp /GTexp . Unfortunately,\nin this region, experimental information on hexp is limited. Some of the calculated nuclei naturally decay from\nthe ground state by \u03b2 \u2212 -decay instead of electron capture, while in other nuclei, the Q-window contains only a\nsmall fraction of the total strength. Thus the total GT+\nstrength could be obtained only by (n, p) or similar oneparticle exchange reactions. An additional uncertainty in\nderiving the hindrance factor, even for nuclei where the\nQ-window is large, comes from the fact that \u03b3-ray spectroscopy misses a significant fraction of the Gamow-Teller\ndecay strength due to sensitivity limits of detectors, a low\n\npopulation of nuclear levels close to the Q-limit as well\nas weak intensity of their decays [10, 21]. This limitation\ncan be largely overcome combining a high-resolution \u03b3ray detector with total absorption spectrometry (TAS),\nas was done in a number of recent experiments on nuclei\nin the 100 Sn region. For example, a study of 97 Ag decay [11] showed that only 2/3 of the total Gamow-Teller\nstrength is obtained by high-resolution \u03b3-ray spectrometry, while the same number for 102 In was about 1/8 [21].\nOne nucleus, 97 Ag, has almost 98% of the total GT\nstrength inside the QEC window. We can use this\nnucleus to estimate the P\nexperimental hindrance factor.\nHu et al [11] reported\nB(GT ) = 3.00(40) based on\nTAS measurements, which leads to the hindrance factor\nhexp = 4.24+0.65\n\u22120.50 . Another nucleus where this window is\nlarge, and there is a TAS measurement available is 98 Ag\n[22]. Hu et al reported the total strength in 98 Ag to\nbe 2.7(4), giving the hindrance factor hexp = 4.27+0.74\n\u22120.55 ,\nsince the calculated BQEC is 11.53 (this is 92% of the total Gamow-Teller strength inside the QEC = 8.24 MeV\nwindow). Thus the hindrance in two Ag isotopes, 97 Ag\nand 98 Ag, are of the order of 4.25, and we adopt this\nvalue for the total hindrance factor h. We did not consider heavier nuclei for the hindrance estimate, because\nthey are further away from our region of interest, and the\npossible Z-dependence of this factor is not clear [11].\nIn this region, the only available total Gamow-Teller\nstrength measured using (n, p) reaction is for 90 Zr. Raywood et al [23] deduced a value of 1.0 \u00b1 0.3 for the total\nstrength. Our calculated total strength for this isotope\nis S(GT+ ) = 0.34. We should note, however, that in our\nrestricted model space there is only one 1+ state in 90 Y.\nThese values can also be compared to recently reported\nmeasurements of 3.0 \u00b1 1.9 for the total strength by Sakai\nand Yako [24].\nWe turn now to strength distributions. Our calculated\nGamow-Teller distributions in the decay of nuclear systems with a few valence protons, like Zr or Mo isotopes,\nhave the strength concentrated in a narrow energy range\n(less than 0.5 MeV) or sometimes in only one transition.\nThe strength in systems with Zvp > 4 (Tc and above) is\ndistributed over the energy range of about 4 MeV. The\nNb isotope chain is intermediate in this respect, because\nin the lowest configuration Nb has only one valence proton in the g9/2 shell, while decays to Zr isotopes are distributed over several states. We show these systematics\nusing a few examples below.\nIn Figs. 3-5, we compare the calculated Gamow-Teller\ndistributions with available data collected from several\nsources. All measurements were done using \u03b3-ray spectroscopy. Data for N = 50 and 51 isotopes were obtained\nfrom Refs. [10, 25, 26] (see also references there in). The\nGT distribution in 97 Ag [11] was obtained with a TAS\nmeasurement. We note that in comparisons to experimental data, we do not include the sensitivity limits of\nexperimental detectors. This sensitivity artificially cuts\noff Gamow-Teller strength near the Q-window so that\ncalculated states are often not observed even 2 MeV be-\n\n\f5\n0.8\n93\n\n+ 93\n\n95\n\n+ 95\n\nTc (\u03b2 )\n\n94\n\nMo\n\n+ 94\n\nRu (\u03b2 )\n\nlow the Q-window (see, e.g., [10, 11, 21]).

In Table I we listed fractions of the calculated\nGamow-Teller strength that lie inside the Q-window.

The strength in even-even nuclei, represented\nhere by even-Z N = 50 isotones, is concentrated in a few\nstates.\nThe Gamow-Teller distribution in 97 Ag shown in Fig.\n3 is converged (around 60 iterations per Jf was required);\nthus the calculated shape is as good as it can be for the\ninteraction. The centroid of experimental Gamow-Teller\nstrength distribution in 97 Ag is lower than the calculation\nexp\ncalc\npredicts: Ecentr\n= 4.3 MeV versus Ecentr\n= 4.7 MeV.\nThis is one of the indicators that the interaction may\nrequire some fine-tuning.\nWe already showed and discussed parts of the calculated Gamow-Teller distributions in Figs. 3-5. Having\nin mind upcoming experiments [9] on Mo isotopes, we\nshow the calculated distributions for the decays of Mo\nisotopes with masses A = 93-97 in Fig. 6.

There we observed the migration of the strength from\nhigher energies to lower energies as the neutron number\nincreases. At 96 Zr, where the lowest configuration is a\ncompletely occupied proton p1/2 shell and a similar situation occurs in the neutron d5/2 shell, the entire strength\nis peaked in one transition. The trend remains also in\n97\nZr.\nWe turn now to a discussion of the calculated total\n\nFIG. 8: Calculated Gamow-Teller distributions in Nb isotopes\nwith masses A = 92-96. See also caption to Fig. 6.\n\nGamow-Teller strength and the centroids. The isotopic\ndependence of the total strength is smooth with the\nstrength decreasing together with the increasing number of neutrons and/or the decreasing number of valence\nprotons in the g9/2 shell. Assuming no mass dependence, an approximate formula can be derived: GT+ =\n0.086(Zv \u2212 1.5)(20 \u2212 Nv ). (The factor (20 \u2212 Nv ) is due\nto the relative unimportance of the h11/2 shell because\nof its negative parity.) This form is somewhat similar to\nthe dependence Zv (20 \u2212 Nv )/A observed in the pf shell\nnuclei (see e.g. [27]). The difference may be related to\nthe active j shells. In the pf shell nuclei, discussed in\nRef. [27], protons predominantly occupy the f7/2 shell;\nthus its occupation is proportional to the number of valence protons. While in our model space, the occupancy\nof the g9/2 proton shell increases due to excitations out\nof the p1/2 shell via configuration mixing. This increase\nis greater for isotopes closer to the core (around 0.6), and\nis 0.2 for A = 97 nuclei with Zv > 2. The formula's \u03c72\nper degree of freedom is 0.05.\nAnother systematic relates to the centroids of the GT+\ndistribution. If plotted with respect to the lowest positive parity state of the daughter nucleus, the centroids\nof Gamow-Teller distributions show a characteristic oddeven staggering, see Fig. 9. They are low in even-even\nnuclei, high in odd-odd nuclei, and average in odd-A nuclei. A similar trend was observed in the mid-pf shell\nnuclei [28].\nLanganke and Mart\u0131\u0301nez-Pinedo [5] interpreted this\nodd-even staggering as a result of pairing energy contributions to the mass splitting between the parent and\ndaughter nuclei (see also [29]).

It is interesting to note that\nthere seems to be a cross-over behavior, which we highlighted by connecting the transitions corresponding to\nthe decays of Zr isotopes. These centroid energies follow\na linear dependence as well, but the inclination is different from that in other nuclei. This behavior is probably\nrelated to the fact that GT+ strength in Zr is due to\nproton excitations out of the p1/2 shell.\n\neven\u2212even\nodd\u2212Z, even\u2212N\neven\u2212Z, odd\u2212N\nodd\u2212odd\nZr \u2212\u2212> Y\n\n18\n\n16\n\n14\n\n12\n\n0.00\n\n0.05\n\n0.10\n\n0.15\n\n0.20\n\n(N\u2212Z)/A\n\nFIG. 10: (Color online) Energy of the GT+ centroid with\nrespect to the calculated ground state energy of the parent\nnucleus as a function of (N \u2212 Z)/A.

We also included the\nCoulomb energy difference, calculated using a formula\n[30] Ec = 0.72(Z 2/A1/3 )(1 \u2212 1.69/A2/3 ), but ignored the\nproton-neutron mass difference and the splitting between\nthe proton and neutron single-particle orbits which would\nbe present if the lowest single-particle energies would be\ntaken with respect to the core nucleus, 88 Sr. The fig-\n\nDISTRIBUTED-MEMORY SHELL-MODEL\nCODE\n\nOur calculations were performed using a new parallel\nshell-model code orpah (Oak Ridge PArallel shell model\ncode), which is still under development. The basic ideas\nare similar to those employed in the serial m-scheme computer code antoine [31, 32]. However, there are differences in the approach, since the code was developed targeting the distributed-memory computational paradigm.\nWhile the distributed-memory approach sets no limits\non the available memory or the number of processors involved in the computation, a natural limitation occurs\ndue to the need to communicate data from one processor\nto another, a process which for collective operations scale\nas Np2 , where Np is the number of processors. However,\neven in cases when the communication becomes unfavorable, there is still a possible trade-off because of a greater\namount of available memory.\nThe most time-consuming part of the shell-model problem is the operation of the Hamiltonian on a vector to\nproduce a new vector which occurs during the Lanczos\nprocedure. This affects load-balancing since each processor needs a similar workload for an effective use of\ncomputational time. We consider parallelization at two\nlevels: the vector amplitudes are distributed among the\nprocessors, and each processor produces a portion of the\nfinal vector in a time-balanced way. We then redistribute\nthe final partial vectors to the appropriate positions after\neach iteration.\nSimilar to antoine, the code numerically builds\n\"blocks\" of identical-particle Slater determinants having\nthe same quantum numbers and sets up tables allowing\nconstruction of the elements of the Hamiltonian matrix\n[32]. Differences arise from the parallel implementation.\nIf the dimension of the model space is D, then the part\nof amplitudes which reside on a particular processor has\nsize D/Np . For a sufficiently large number of processors, D/Np can get smaller than the size of the largest\nblock. This would place the limit for the maximum reasonable number of processors. Operations involving this\nblock are also the most time-consuming. We decided to\nsplit the blocks in order to have smaller pieces of tasks,\nwhich could be distributed among the processors more\nefficiently. During the operation of the Hamiltonian acting on a vector, some of the amplitudes are prefetched\nand others are requested during the calculation. There is\n\n\f8\nno predefined communication pattern, since some amplitudes can be delivered with some delay while the process\nwould still be able to employ the ones already present in\nthe memory. To enable this disconnection of computation and communication, each processor consists of two\nthreads responsible for those two tasks. Those threads\ncommunicate via shared variables. The need to deliver\namplitudes creates a communication overhead on top of\nthe time needed to produce the final Lanczos vector. The\nlatter operation is well balanced (i.e., is inversely proportional to the number of processors), while the overhead\ndepends on the number of processors involved in the calculation. The final Lanczos vector is reorthogonalized to\nprevious vectors. Due to orthogonality of the basis, each\nprocessor can produce the partial sum of a scalar product, and a global communication is needed only to obtain\nthe total sum.\nThere is no coded-in restriction on the number of processors, with the exception that the minimum number of\nprocessors is two, because of the manager-worker algorithm employed in the Hamiltonian table set-up procedure. The current version of the code can calculate eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian, the total angular momentum and isospin, as well as GT properties.\nSome computations were done on a 2-4 CPU computer;\nothers were done at the NERSC computer Seaborg using\nup to 80 processors. The largest problem that we tried to\nsolve was the ground state energy of 52 Fe (D = 110\u00d7106)\non 48 processors, but the current set-up did not allow\nus to reach such dimensions in the region of our study.\nIn addition, a further improvement in the performance\nis required before the code assessment is done, though\nthe distributed-memory computation is a venue to solve\nlarger interacting shell-model problems.\nV.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nWe calculated nuclei above 88 Sr having masses A = 9097 using a realistic effective interaction derived from the\nCD-Bonn potential. The agreement between the calculated and measured spectra is satisfactory. Improvements\nto the interaction through fine tuning of the matrix elements could be useful to obtain the finer spectroscopic\ndetails, including the level ordering or the placement of\nnegative-parity states in several nuclei, but this is beyond\nthe scope of this exploratory work.\nWe also calculated the total Gamow-Teller strength\nand strength distributions for the decay in the electron\ncapture direction. We found that the total strength\nfollows the single-particle estimate based on the \u03c0g9/2\nand \u03bdg7/2 occupation numbers obtained from the ground\nstate wave functions of the parent nucleus, although the\n\n[1] B.A. Brown and B.H. Wildenthal, Annu. Rev. Nucl. Part.\nSci. 38, 29 (1988).\n\nvalues slightly differ from a naive single-particle shellmodel picture. Calculated strength distributions appear\nto reasonably recover experimental distributions in regions that are unaffected by detector sensitivity limits.\nFrom TAS data on 97 Ag, we were able to obtain an estimate of the phenomenological quenching factor relative\nto single-particle estimates. Furthermore, our GT distribution for 97 Ag reproduces the measured data, see Fig.\n3. By analyzing the centroids of the Gamow-Teller distributions, we found that the odd-even staggering behavior disappears if the centroids are measured from the\nparent ground state, as was suggested by Langanke and\nMart\u0131\u0301nez-Pinedo [5]. We also observed that the centroids\nmeasured in this way have a quasi-linear dependency on\nthe parameterization (N \u2212 Z)/A, with a different inclination for nuclei where no protons are present in the g9/2\nshell in the non-interacting picture. Finally, we made\nseveral predictions of the strength distributions for measurements that may soon be available in mass A = 92-97\nnuclei.\nThe description of low-lying Gamow-Teller strength\ndistributions in a large range of nuclei (from roughly\nmass A = 50 to mass A = 150) is one important ingredient in understanding type-II supernova explosions,\nsince electrons get captured by nuclei through these levels. Of course, this is not the whole story since firstand second-forbidden transitions (typically difficult to\naccess in the laboratory) also play an important role in\nthe cross section and rate calculations relevant for supernova. For low-energy capture, the Gamow-Teller transitions will dominate. They also dominate the neutrinonucleus scattering processes that may occur at later times\nin the supernova event. While theory can produce many\nthings, measurements are necessary to validate the estimates. Such is the case in the nuclear region discussed in\nthis paper. We eagerly await experimental comparisons\nto our calculations.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe are pleased to acknowledge useful discussions\nwith T. Engeland, M. Hjorth-Jensen, K.
