(See Mereghetti 2001 for a review.) They have periods in the\nrange 6-12s, X-ray luminosities in the range 1034 \u2212 1036 ergs/s, very soft X-ray spectra, little\nor no variability on time scales from hours to years, and they undergo relatively steady\nspin-down with no evidence for binary motion. The limited number of members of this\nclass (\u223c 6) has inhibited development of a theoretical understanding of their properties.\nModels to account for their X-ray emission generally fall into two categories depending\non the energy source, either loss of magnetic field energy (magnetar models) (Thompson\n& Duncan 1996; Heyl & Hernquist 1997) or accretion. Accretion models may be further\nsubdivided according to the source of infalling material; binary companion models e.g.\nMereghetti & Stella (1995), or accretion from a disk leftover from a supernova explosion\n(Marsden et al. 2001, Francischelli & Wijers 2002).\nIn this paper we present evidence for a possible addition to this class. In an examination\nof archival X-ray data from a number of X-ray satellites (ROSAT, Chandra, RXTE) we\nhave discovered evidence for a previously unreported pulsar in the Small Magellanic Cloud.\nThe properties of this pulsar are consistent with those of the AXPs. By virtue of the known\ndistance to the SMC, 57 kpc (Feast & Walker 1987), the luminosity can be rather accurately\nestablished and it falls in the range of AXP luminosities. If this is a correct identification,\nthen it will be the fastest yet discovered (P = 5.44 s) and the first extragalactic AXP if we\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\ndiscount the soft gamma repeater, 0526-66, in the LMC. This latter source exhibits all the\ncharacteristics of an AXP when it is not bursting (Marsden et al. 2001).\n\n2.\n\nOBSERVATIONS\n\nThe discovery data were obtained from a 100ks ACIS-I observation which began\n2001 May 15, obsid 1881. The position of the source is: 01h 00m 43.14s , -72\u25e6 11\u2032\n33.8\u2032\u2032 (J2000), approximately 10 arc minutes from the ACIS-I aim point. The density\nof the stellar field, and its location well out of the Galactic plane, mitigate against\nready boresight correction of the Chandra data. Apart from applying the prescribed\naspect offset for this data set (See the Chandra X-ray Center \"Aspect caveat\" page at\nhttp://asc.harvard.edu/cal/ASPECT/aspect caveats.html), we have not further refined the\nprovided aspect solution. Given the negligible uncertainty in the source centroid (\u223c0.05\narcsec), we expect an absolute astrometric accuracy in line with the overall Chandra\nperformance to date, which has provided a 90%-confidence radial uncertainty of 0.6 arcsec;\nsee http://asc.harvard.edu/cal/ASPECT/celmon/index.html.\nIn accordance with the CHANDRA source naming convention, the source is designated\nCXOU J0110043.1-721134. A selection circle of 24 pixels (11.8\") was chosen to encompass\n> 90% of the source photons. 6099 photons were retrieved from the observation with a\nbackground estimated to be 111 photons. The times of arrival of the source photons at the\nspace craft were adjusted to the barycenter of the solar system and a fast Fourier transform\n(fft) was performed.\nInasmuch as the ACIS-I CCD read-out time is a fixed 3.241 seconds, the Nyquist\nlimiting frequency for the fft is 1/6.482s = 0.154 Hz. In order to show clearly this limitation,\nthe fft was performed with a bin size of 0.1 seconds, and a portion of the resulting power\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nspectrum (normalized to unity power) is shown in figure 1. There are three peaks present,\ntwo of which are aliases of each other at 0.124706(1) and 0.183828(1) Hz, on opposite sides\nof the Nyquist frequency. These peaks have highly significant power values of 38.4. The\nchance probability of such a power is \u223c 3 \u00d7 10\u221217 . The peak at 0.308 Hz is due to the\ndigitization limit (3.241 s) of the ACIS-I and has a power value approximately equal to the\nnumber of photons.\nThe spectrum of the source is very soft. An acceptable spectral fit to the data is given\nby a black-body model with an absorption column density 1.4\u00b10.2 \u00d7 1021 H-atoms/cm2 and\na value of kT = 0.41\u00b10.01 keV. The fit to the data is shown in Figure 2.\nA search of imaging X-ray satellite archives for data for this source has produced\nmany observations dating from 1979. These observations are listed in Table 1. The most\nextensive source coverage is from the ROSAT satellite. For ROSAT we have restricted the\nobservations shown in the Table by excluding all observations which contain fewer than \u223c\n50 source photons. This means that for the ROSAT HRI exposures less than 7.5 ks are\nexcluded. For the PSPC exposures less than 1.5 ks are excluded as are observations in\nwhich the source is more than 30 arc minutes from the center of the field of view. This\nlatter restriction is designed to avoid large vignetting corrections to the counting rate.\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\n\n40\n\nChandra ACIS-I 100ks Observation\nNyquist\n\n20\n0\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n\nFig. 1.- FFT of CHANDRA Observation of CXOU J0110043.1-721134.

The luminosity is calculated for the CHANDRA spectral range 0.2 to 10\nkeV.\nFrom the Table we notice a near constancy of flux values for a given instrument. The\ntwo Einstein observations are consistent. The HRI fluxes are consistent with a constant\nflux (chi-squared probability 6%). There is a single high PSPC observation (rp600455n00)\nwhich is nearly 5 \u03c3 above the mean. Without that observation the remaining PSPC count\nrates are consistent with a constant flux (chi-squared probability 26%)\nThe luminosity values from different detectors are also nearly consistent with one\nanother, averaging to a value of 1.5\u00d71035 ergs/s. ROSAT observations which are not\nincluded in the table (e.g. PSPC observations with the source further than 30 arc minutes\nfrom the center of the field) show the source as well. Thus the the variability of this\nsource on a time scale of months to years is relatively small. In addition, within the 100ks\nCHANDRA observation there is no significant variation of the source count rate.\nWe may use the CHANDRA data as a guide to calculate what fft power values are\nto be expected from the other observations. The limited time resolution of the ACIS-I\ndata and the fact that the pulsed signal is near the Nyquist limiting frequency of 0.154\nTable 1-Continued\n\nSatellite\n\nCH.

We therefore\nmake the assumption that the pulsations are purely sinusoid, in which case the power\n2\nexpected is 0.25 Npulsed\n/Ntot , where Npulsed is the number of pulsed photons and Ntot is the\n\ntotal number of photons. By setting the power to be the observed value of 38 and taking\ninto account the 2% background, we find that the pulsed fraction is 16\u00b13%.\nAs a further attempt to detect pulsations from CXOU J0110043.1-721134 we analyzed\ndata from the observation (rp600195a00) which has the highest sensitivity to a pulsed\nsignal. It has the second longest exposure (16 ks) of any of the PSPC observations and\nhas by far the shortest duration (85 ks). Other comparable exposure PSPC and HRI\nobservations have durations more than 15 times longer and their sensitivity to a periodic\nsignal is diluted by the search range needed to cover potential frequency variation over this\nlength of time. The duration of rp600195a00 is such that no phase slippage is expected for\n\u1e56 s in the range of the AXPs.\nThe source for this observation is within 12.7' of the center of the PSPC field of view\nwhere the angular resolution is excellent, thus a selection circle of 80 pixels (40\") could be\nused. With this selection 392 photons were retrieved, of which an estimated 37.6\u00b11 are\nbackground. A comparison of the pulse height spectrum for the source and the background,\nshowed that sensitivity to a pulsed signal could be enhanced by eliminating photons with\nenergies less than 0.4 keV. With this restriction 358 photons remained. The times of\narrival of these photons were adjusted to the barycenter of the solar system and an fft was\nperformed.\nWe restricted our search region to be near one of the two possible frequencies seen\nin the CHANDRA observation, either 0.1247 or 0.1838 (Hz). To account for a frequency\nchange over the 9.6 years between the two observations we assume that the object has\ncharacteristics of the known AXPs. This implies that the pulsar is spinning down, and that\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nthe time scale for this, P/\u1e56 , is greater than 6.8 ky (see the table in Mereghetti 2001). In\nthe search we have allowed for a possible time scale as short as 1 ky.\nWith these assumptions the range of frequencies to be searched is 1.20 mHz at the\nlower frequency and 1.76 mHz at the upper frequency. The ffts near these frequencies for\nboth the CHANDRA observation (a) and (b) and the PSPC observation are shown in\nFigure 3. In the lower frequency search region there is no significant power peak, however\nin the upper region there is a peak power of 15.4 which may be significant.\nTo assess its significance we use a formula first derived by Fisher (1929). This formula\ngives the probability that a given Fourier power, P, taken from a range of n independent\nvalues of power, will be exceeded by chance. Equation (4) of Fisher gives that probability\nas a series, whose leading term, n(1 \u2212 g)n\u22121 is the only term which is significant for our\nvalues of P and n. The parameter \"g\" is the fraction of the power contained in the term\nin question. We have used normalized values of power, thus g = P/n. However, since we\nhave used a frequency digitization finer than the independent frequency spacing, 1/T, we\nmust multiply Fisher's expression by an oversampling factor. For the fft's we have used a\nfrequency spacing of \u223c 1/5T for which an appropriate value of the oversampling factor is 3\n(Lewis, 1994).\nPutting in the numbers we find a chance probability of 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22124 of finding such a\npower of 15.4 or greater within either search range. We judge this to be sufficiently small\nto be a detection. Using the PSPC observation which occurred 3705 days prior to the\nCHANDRA observation, we derive a frequency derivative of \u22125.08 \u00b1 0.07 \u00d7 10\u221213 Hz/s.\nThis corresponds to a time scale, P/\u1e56 , of 11 ky.\nIn addition to the peak at 0.183982(2) Hz there are two other peaks in its vicinity\nwith powers greater than 8. They are separated from the main peak by 0.000173 Hz and\n0.000519 Hz. These peaks are due to the on-time profile (window function) of the PSPC\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\ndata. The 0.000173 Hz frequency is a beat frequency with the orbital period of the satellite\n(96 minutes); the 0.00519 Hz frequency is its third harmonic. In a simulation of the dataset\nwe have reproduced this behavior.\nThe pulse profile of the PSPC observation is shown in Figure 4. There is no evidence\nin the fft for harmonics higher than the fundamental. The pulsed fraction is 36\u00b15%. This\ndisagrees with the 16% value derived from the CHANDRA detection. This discrepancy can\nbe accounted for by the different spectral response of the two detectors and a difference\nbetween the unpulsed and pulsed spectrum. Relative to the ACIS-I detector the PSPC\nweights lower energy photons significantly more than higher energy photons. For example,\nthe ratio of effective area for the PSPC at 0.8 keV to its effective area at 2.0 keV is \u223c 3.\nThe same ratio for the ACIS-I detector is \u223c0.8. Further we find that the pulsed source\nspectrum is somewhat softer than its unpulsed emission. Therefore because of the PSPC's\nenergy response it will detect the pulsed part of source emission more efficiently than the\nunpulsed part. This qualitatively accounts for the higher pulsed fraction as determined by\nthe PSPC.\nWe have calculated the sensitivity of the remaining non-CHANDRA observations\nusing this value of the pulsed fraction. We find that none of the other non-CHANDRA\nobservations listed in Table 1 would be sensitive to this pulsation.\nWe have searched for a possible radio/optical counterpart to CXOU J0110043.1-721134\nand find no radio counterpart. There is an 18th magnitude star (S01020208968 in\nthe Guide Star Catalogue-II available on-line through http://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/vizbin/cat?I/271#sRM99.3) which is located 1.2 arc seconds from the source. The position\nof CXOU J0110043.1-721134 has an uncertainly of 0.6 arc seconds, therefore it is unlikely\nto be associated with this star. Nevertheless it remains a possibility pending refinement of\nthe X-ray source position.

Multi-band optical photometry has been performed on this star by Naz\u00e9\net al (2002). The authors believe this star may be an early B star. If this star is a binary\ncompanion of CXOU J0110043.1-721134 then it would be the first seen for an AXP and\nwould raise the possibility of accretion as the source of its luminosity.\n\n3.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe properties exhibited by CXOU J0110042.8-721132 are fully consistent with the\nAXP class of X-ray pulsar (Mereghetti 2001 and references therein). Its spectrum is very\nsoft - consistent with other AXPs. Its luminosity, \u223c 1.5 \u00d7 1035 ergs/s/cm2 , is in the range\nof AXP luminosities (1034 \u2212 1036 ergs/s/cm2 ). There is little variation in its long-term and\nand short-term intensity, and it is spinning down with a characteristic age, P/\u1e56 , of 11 ky,\ntypical of 3 of the 6 AXPs.\nOne of the central issues for AXPs is their energy source. If accretion then there may\nbe a companion from which the accretion occurs and which will cause a modulation in the\npulsation unless the orbit is observed face on. (Some models of accretion powered AXPs\nderive their accretion from a remnant disk leftover from a supernova explosion (Marsden\net al. 2001, Francischelli & Wijers 2002).) The 100ks continuous CHANDRA observation\nprovides an opportunity for a search for binary induced modulation.\nWe have subdivided the observation into four 25 ks segments, and separately performed\nan fft on each. The power peak in the 0.184 Hz region shows no significant frequency\nvariation. In addition, we have explored what would happen to the time series of photons\nfrom the source if a hypothetical binary modulation were superimposed. For binary orbits\nwith periods less than one day we find that a projected semi-major axis of more than 0.5\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nlight seconds will reduce the power of the signal by more than one standard deviation in\nthe power. We take this to be an effective limit on the size of any orbit. For orbital periods\nlonger than the 1.2 day observation this size limit is weakened.\nThis absence of any apparent binary modulation on a time scale \u2264 1 day is consistent\nwith evidence for other of the AXPs (Mereghetti 2001) for the lack of a binary companion.\nThree of the AXPs appear to be associated with relatively young (< 20 ky) supernova\nremnants. In each of these cases: (1E 2259+586: Rho & Petre 1997, Parmar et al. 1998);\n1E 1841-045, Helfand et al. 1994; and J1844-0288, Vasisht et al. 2000) there is evidence for\nextended X-ray emission. We have examined the CHANDRA data for evidence of emission\nbeyond that which is consistent with a point source. We find none. However, a better limit\non any possible extension to the source may be derived from ROSAT HRI observations (the\nfirst two in the Table) in which the source was approximately 6 arc minutes from the center\nof the field where the angular resolution of the HRI is better than in CHANDRA data\n10 arc minutes off-axis. One-dimensional profiles though the image in the right ascension\nand declination directions of the combined HRI dataset are consistent with a point source\nwith a width (\u03c3) of 2.0 arc seconds. There is no evidence for emission at a level > 5% the\ncounting rate at the peak of the profiles at a distance of 10 to 20 arc seconds from the\nsource. Any extension to the source must be a distance from the source less than the width\nof the point spread function of the HRI, 10 arc seconds. This corresponds to a limit to the\nsize of any extended X-ray emission of 2.8 pc at the distance of the SMC.\nThis limit is comparable to the X-ray extension observed for the two SNR/AXP\nassociations with known distances (Kes 73/1E 1841-045 and CT109/1E 2259.1+586). A\ndeep CHANDRA exposure with the source centered in the field of the HRC is needed to\nconstrain strongly the possibility of a supernova remnant association for this pulsar.\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nThis work made use of software and data provided by the High-Energy Astrophysics\nArchival Research Center (HEASARC) located at Goddard Space Flight Center.\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\nREFERENCES\nFeast, M.W. & Walker, A.R. 1987, ARA&A, 25, 345\nFisher, R.A., 1929, Proc.
