The hybrid eclipse witnessed by Clavius in Rome\n(1567) and published on his Commentarius on the Sphere (1581 edition) was the first\naccount of an annular eclipse ever published in a scientific book. To account of this\neclipse a larger solar diameter for 1567 has to be considered, and the scientific debate\nis still open. This is the trait-d'union between Clavius and ESOP annual meeting. The\ncity of Pescara and the region of Abruzzo are presented with an historical, climatic,\nreligious and gastronomical outline.\nClavius, the Euclid of XVI century\nChristopher Clavius (Bamberg 1538- Napoli 1612) was one of the greatest\nastronomers working at the dawn of telescopic age and contributing to the\nCopernican revolution. He taught mathematics and astronomy at the Collegio\nRomano for four decades, earning the title of \"The second Euclid\" and gave a\ncontribution to the Gregorian reformation of the Calendar (1582) of paramount\nimportance. The hybrid eclipse witnessed by Clavius in Rome (1567) and published\non his Commentarius on the Sphere (1581 edition) was the first account of an annular\neclipse ever published in a scientific book. According to Ptolemy's parameters such\nan eclipse was impossible because the angular solar diameter would never be larger\nthan the lunar one. This eclipse was considered by J. Eddy in 1978 in order to\ndemonstrate a larger physical diameter of the Sun before the Maunder minimum\n(1645-1715). The eclipse project has been carried out by several fellows of the\nEuropean Section of International Occultation Timing Association (IOTA/ES), and by\ntiming the Baily's beads the solar angular diameter is recovered up to a few\nhundredths of arcsecond of accuracy. This is the trait-d'union between Clavius, IOTA\nand solar diameter measurements: a project to monitor the solar diameter with driftscan methods from ground is named Clavius.\n\n\fFig.1 Clavius with the image of pope Gregory XIII, the reformer of the calendar.\nA section dedicated to Clavius will have prominent scientists and historians, ready to\npresent this figure of very high level at the dawn of telescopic era in astronomy.\nOccultation astronomy and Relativity\nOccultation astronomy, among all classical astronomy, provides the more accurate\nmeasurements of positional and physical parameters of asteroids, TNO and stars,\npaving the way to all relativistic measurements. That's why the International Center\nfor Relativistic Astrophysics Network coordinating center of Pescara welcomes this\nmeeting. Since more three decades ESOP gathered professional and amateur\nastronomers to share projects and observations based on the accurate timing of the\noccultations (asteroidal, lunar and Baily's beads).\nAmong the works relating Occultation Astronomy and General Relativity I can refer\nto the references of the following papers: Astrometry and Relativity [1]; Relativistic\nImplications of Solar Astrometry [2] where the topic of the solar oblateness, a\npossible issue of eclipse measurements, is strictly related with the Dicke's\nexperiments on quadrupole moment of the Sun in order to explain the anomalous\nprecession of Mercury's perihelion. Also the paper dealing with the occultation of\n161 Rhodope over Regulus of 19 october 2005 [3] showed the possibility to observe\nthe relativistic light bending in the gravitational field of the Sun even 48\u00b0 apart.\n\n\fThe hospitality of ICRANet, an international organism dedicated to General\nRelativity studies, for the ESOP meeting is therefore grounded also over solid\nscientific basis.\n\nPescara and Abruzzo\nThe yearly meetings, started before the fall of the Berlin's wall, were organized with\nthe alternance of Eastern and Western Europe. Pescara, on the Adriatic Sea, is also a\nnatural gate open to the Eastern Countries, and welcomes eagerly the XXXI ESOP in\n2012.\nPescara is facing Albania, and the harbor of Split, in the former Jugoslavia. So the\ninfluence of Eastern Countries in this city is strong, and the presence of foreign\npeople is normal.\nPescara is a young city, having celebrated its 85 years of foundation on January 2,\n2012. But this city is the merge of two former villages, Castellamare and Pescara.\nThe geographical position allowed to this city to develop rapidly. With about 300000\npeople leaving in its surroundings Pescara become the most populated urban area of\nAbruzzo, the region immediately to the East of Lazio, were Rome is. In the years 70s\nan highway has been realized between Rome and Pescara, the A25 branch of the\nnational highway network, and this allows in 1 hour and half to go from the capital\nto that pearl of the Adriatic sea.\nAbruzzo is called the Green Region of Europe, because agriculture is still the major\nsource of its economy, and was under subventions from EU in the previous decade.\nIt maintained its medieval traditions rather unchanged until the very last years,\nthanks to the geographical insulation due to the horography. Appennines Mountains\nseparate Abruzzo from Rome, and from the wealthier region of Marche at North, and\nfrom Puglia at South, where the shepherds from Abruzzo travelled to spend the\nwinter with the flock. The climate in the mountain region is severe, reaching in some\nclosed valleys the lowest temperatures of the whole peninsula (-32\u00b0C). Moreover\nthanks to the barrier that the mountains offer to the western currents from\nMediterranean and from Atlantic, the region is under the influence of Balcan area,\nwith the possibility to experience cold winters (record -13\u00b0C on January 4, 1979) even\nin Pescara.\nThat is for saying that the people from Abruzzo were used to face hard conditions of\nwork in a life of sacrifices in order to obtain the food from the Earth.\n\n\fReligion and history\nOther important aspects of that region, as all regions of Italy, are the religious\ntraditions. Now by the young generations, subjected to the globalization, these\ntraditions are perceived more as touristic attractions, but the ancestral strength of\nthese practices gains power as the youth matures.\nIn the mountains of Majella and Morrone the hermit Pietro Angelerio settled himself\nand a community of monk flourished in the fall of XIII century. Later in 1294 while\nhe was in the mountain monastery of Sulmona he was elected pope, and he chose the\nname of Celestin V. He decided to be crowned in L'Aquila on August 29, 1294 the\nday of the feast of St. John the Baptist. After his death he was declared saint because\nof his many miracles.\n\nFig. 2 The Perdonanza Celestiniana in L'Aquila on August 28-29.\nThis day become the first Jubilee, and the Jubilee of 1300 was inspired by this first\nevent. A great ceremony was celebrated every year in L'Aquila from the evening of\n28 to the evening of 29 of August: la Perdonanza. The 718th Perdonanza will occur\n\n\fright after the end of the ESOP meeting, and it is one occasion to visit the city of\nL'Aquila, the city founded by the \"stupor Mundi\" Frederic II of Svevia and twice\ndestroyed by an earthquake in 1703 and in 2009. \"Immota manet\", fixed stays as the\nmotto of L'Aquila says...\n\nFig. 3 The church of Santa Maria in Collemaggio, built by saint Pietro Celestino, is\none of the marvels of Abruzzo. There is the holy door opened on 28-29 August.\nSummer in Pescara\nThe month of August is the warmest of the year. The Foehn wind through the\nMajella mountain, called Garbino, can raise the temperature of the air up to the\nrecord of 45\u00b0C of August 30, 2007, with very low humidity. The city is comfortable\nand the sea breeze makes the afternoon hours rather mild.\nPescara has some free beaches; one of them is 400 meter in front of the location of the\ncongress, in the most central position of the city, very close to all hotels. Other\nbeaches are equipped with all services, and the entrance is upon payment.\nGastronomical tradition in Abruzzo is incredibly rich, and nobody can complain of\nfood in this region, which hosts the most famous school of Chefs de Cuisine in the\nWorld: the one of Villa Santa Maria.\n\n\fFig. 4 La costa dei trabocchi, seaside in the surroundings of Pescara.\nThe invitation to attend the Clavius four centennial and the XXXI ESOP meeting and\nto know the Green Region of Europe, where also the sea is green as the pastures of the\nmountains (to quote Gabriele d'Annunzio, a famous italian poet born in Pescara) is\nmade.
