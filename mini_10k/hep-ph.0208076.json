After a release of the new E821 result [1], based on the \u03bc+ data collected in\nthe year 2000, a current mean of experimental results for (g \u2212 2)\u03bc is ([1]:\naexp\n\u03bc \u2261\n\n(g \u2212 2)exp\n\u03bc\n= 11 659 203 (8) \u00d7 10\u221210 ,\n2\n\n(1)\n\nwith an uncertainty (in parentheses) that is almost two times smaller than in the previous\nmeasurement [2], and only two times larger than the ultimate goal of the E821 experiment.\nThe Standard Model prediction for a\u03bc consists of the QED, EW and hadronic contributions:\n+ aEW\n+ ahad\naSM\n= aQED\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\u03bc .\nThe QED contribution, which constitutes the bulk of the SM contributions, is calculated up to\nfour loops and the O(\u03b15 ) term is estimated [3]; its uncertainty is very small \u223c 3 \u00d7 10\u221211 . The\nEW contribution, based on one- and two-loop diagrams, is also known to a similar accuracy\n[4\u20138] The EW contribution is small (152 \u00d7 10\u221211 ) and is only about two times larger than\nthe present experimental uncertainty (see (1)). The hadronic contribution, \u223c 7000 \u00d7 10\u221211 ,\nis the second largest contribution to aSM\n\u03bc . It is known at present with an accuracy of 1 %.\nThis uncertainty is the main source of the uncertainty in the SM prediction. Predictions for\nthe hadronic contribution [9-21] differ among themselves, however, these differences seem to\nbe much less significant than, say, one year ago (see e.g. discussions in [11,12,17-21], and also\nin [23, 24]). The dominant contribution to ahad\n\u03bc , as well as one of the dominant errors in its\nvalue, come from the leading vacuum-polarization (vp1) term. Some preliminary results of the\nimproved calculations of the vp1 have been presented recently [13, 14]. These are data-driven\nanalyses using the most recent data on hadron production in e+ e\u2212 collisions from BES, CMD-2,\nSND [22]. The corresponding uncertainties for the vp1, \u223c 58 \u00d7 10\u221211 , are now even smaller\nthan those obtained previously by using the data on \u03c4 decays in addition to the then available\ne+ e\u2212 data, e.g. see [10, 12]. Another important issue has been the hadronic contribution to the\nlight-by-light (lbl) scattering, and its contribution to (g \u2212 2)\u03bc . After a sign error, first pointed\nout in [18], was found in the earlier calculations of this contribution, a few re-evaluations [19]\nof this part have appeared during the last few months. All of them confirm the finding of\n[18], i.e. a positive sign of the lbl contribution. The central value for the lbl varies from 80 to\n110 \u00d7 10\u221211 , depending on the analysis. Since this contribution can be estimated only on a\npurely theoretical ground, it has a sizeable uncertainty of the order of 40 \u00d7 10\u221211 [20] (or maybe\neven larger, as discussed in [21]).\nThe latest SM predictions and the present world average of the experimental result (1)\ndiffer by \u223c 3\u03c3 (a theoretical and experimental error combined in quadrature), if preliminary\nresults of the evaluation of the vp1 contribution from [13, 14] are used together with the\nestimation for the lbl given in [20]. The significant progress in the reduction of the error on\nmakes it essential for\nthe experimental side and the stabilization of the SM prediction of ahad\n\u03bc\n2\n\n\fthe possible implications of the (g \u2212 2)\u03bc results to be reanalysed.\na signal of supersymmetry is already being addressed [25]. Here\nof the latest (g \u2212 2)\u03bc results for the light-Higgs boson scenarios\nCP-conserving Two-Higgs-Doublet-Model (2HDM) in its version\ncontinuation of earlier studies [24, 26, 27].\n\nThe issue of whether this is\nwe focus on the implication\nin the non-supersymmetric,\ncalled \"Model II\"; this is a\n\nIn sec. 2 we collect some results based on the recent calculations of aSM\n\u03bc . As a reference\n+ \u2212\nfor the vp1 contribution we take the e e data-driven analysis done by Jegerlehner [13], FJ02,\nwhere the new CMD-2 results were used. The difference between the experimental data and\nthe SM prediction, \u2206a\u03bc = aexp\n\u2212 aSM\n\u03bc\n\u03bc , can be used to derive stringent constraints on the\nparameters of models, which give additional contribution(s) to a\u03bc . We calculate the interval\n\u03b4a\u03bc , which can then be used to constrain any such contribution, at 95% CL. In sec. 3 we\nintroduce the 2HDM(II), which we wish to constrain using this interval, and discuss briefly the\nexisting constraints. In sec. 4 we derive the 95% CL limits on the parameters of this model,\nusing \u03b4a\u03bc . Section 5 contains the combined constraints, while the conclusions and outlook are\ngiven in sec. 6.\n\n2\n\nThe g \u2212 2 for the muon: the new experimental\nand theoretical results\n\nHere we collect the SM contributions (and their uncertainties), which we take into account\nin our analysis. First we discuss the hadronic contributions (see table 1). We use the higher\norder contribution from [16] and, for the lbl scattering contribution, we take an estimate from\n[20]. The leading vacuum polarization contribution is taken from a preliminary result of an\nanalysis by Jegerlehner, FJ02 [13], where the experimental input is based only on the e+ e\u2212 data,\nincluding the latest ones from CMD-2 [22]. We sum all the hadronic contributions, adding in\ngiven in the last row\nquadrature the corresponding errors. This leads us to the result for ahad\n\u03bc\nof table 1 (which we label by the author of the analysis of the vp1 contribution).\nTABLE 1\nHadronic contribution\nho [16]\nlbl [20]\nvp1 [13]\nhad [FJ02]\n\n[in 10\u221211 ]\n\u2212 100 (6)\n80 (40)\n6889 (58)\n6869 (71)\n\nWe take the QED and EW terms from [3] and [7, 8], respectively (see table 2). We then calculate\nthe total SM prediction presented in this table, by adding the QED and EW to the full hadronic\ncontributions, and by adding in quadrature the corresponding errors. This leads us to the SM\nprediction (we label it, as above, by the author of the analysis of the vp1 contribution):\n[FJ02]\n\naSM\n= 116 591 726.7 (70.9) \u00d7 10\u221211 .\n\u03bc\n3\n\n(2)\n\n\fTaking the new world average we calculate the quantity \u2206a\u03bc , defined as the difference\nbetween the central values of the experimental and theoretical (SM) predictions for a\u03bc . The\nerror for this quantity we estimate\nby adding in quadrature the corresponding experimental\nq\n2\n2\n. Next we calculate the regions of \u03b4a\u03bc , allowed at 95%\nand theoretical errors, \u03c3 = \u03c3exp + \u03c3SM\nCL, assuming Gaussian errors. This leads to an interval symmetric around \u2206a\u03bc , quoted in the\nlast row of table 2.\nTABLE 2\nSM contribution\n[in 10\u221211 ]\nQED\n116 584 705.7 (2.9)\nhad[FJ02]\n6 869.0 (70.7)\nEW\n152.0 (4.0)\ntot\n116 591 726.7 (70.9)\n\u2206a\u03bc (\u03c3)\n303.3 (106.9)\nlim(95%)\n93.8 \u2264 \u03b4a\u03bc \u2264 512.8\nThe 95% CL interval \u03b4a\u03bc thus obtained is positive, and hence it leads to an allowed positive\ncontribution (an allowed band). At the same time it also leads to the exclusion of any negative\ncontribution to the a\u03bc . Note that the additional positive contribution to a\u03bc can be up to a few\ntimes larger than the EW one.\nUsing results for the vp1 contribution obtained by the HMNT group [14], from their \"exclusive\" analysis, the values we get for aSM\n\u03bc , \u2206a\u03bc (\u03c3) and \u03b4a\u03bc , are numerically very close to those\nobtained above, using the FJ02 analysis. Keeping all the other contributions as before, but\nwith the HMNT(ex) results for the vp1 term [14], we get, in units of 10\u221211 ,\n[HMNT(ex)] :\n\n\u2206a\u03bc (\u03c3) = 297.0 (107.2)\n\n87.2 \u2264 \u03b4a\u03bc \u2264 507.4,\n\n(3)\n\nwhile their \"inclusive\" analysis leads to a more stringent constraint, namely\n[HMNT(in)] :\n\n\u2206a\u03bc (\u03c3) = 357.2 (106.4)\n\n148.7 \u2264 \u03b4a\u03bc \u2264 565.7.\n\n(4)\n\nNote that the above 95% CL intervals are positive for both the HMNT results, just as in\nthe FJ02 case. Also note that the relative differences between the upper bounds in all three\nanalyses are small (below 10%). However, the use of HMNT \"inclusive\" analysis leads to a\nlower bound, which is relatively much higher (up to 70%) than in the FJ02 and HMNT(ex)\ncases.\nThe other recently published SM predictions [10, 12], to which the BNL paper [1] refers,\nwere obtained from analyses of the vp1 contribution based on the older, often not very precise\ne+ e\u2212 data. To improve the accuracy of the estimation of the vp1 part, \u03c4 decay data were\nincluded in addition in those analyses. However, predictions obtained there for aSM\nand for\n\u03bc\n\u03c3SM are not very different from these new preliminary results used by us. It is worth mentioning\nthat the following trend is observed (see discussion e.g. in [13]): if one uses the \u03c4 -decay data\nin the calculation of vp1, then its estimation for the value of vp1 increases while that for the\nuncertainty decreases. On the other hand, the preliminary FJ02 and HMNT analyses of the\n4\n\n\fvp1 contribution, the ones used here, rely solely on the low-energy data for the e+ e\u2212 collisions.\nThe accuracy of these analyses increases significantly with respect to the earlier analyses of\nthe same kind thanks to an inclusion of new, high-precision measurements [22] and the use of\nmore refined theoretical methods. Moreover, the central value for the vp1 contribution did not\nincrease in these new analyses. Thus, the preliminary analyses by FJ02 and HMNT lead to a\ndeviation from the experimental value for the muon (g \u2212 2) larger than the published results\nmentioned above, which differ by \"only\" 1.6 to 2.6 \u03c3, as pointed out in [1].\nLet us conclude this general part by the following comment. It becomes clear that already\nat present there is a need of a coherent and a comprehensive error analysis for all components\ncontributing to the calculation of \u03c3\u03bcSM . It will be even more nessesary in a near future, when the\nBNL experiment will reach the planned accuracy. Since an estimate combining all the different\ncontributions does not exist for aSM\n\u03bc , and hence for \u2206a\u03bc , which is needed for estimating the\neffects of new physics, is not available at the moment, a simplified error analysis, as presented\nin this section, is unavoidable. This is sufficient for a rough estimation of new effects; however,\nto reach a final conclusion, better error analyses are necessary.\n\n3\n3.1\n\n2HDM and existing constraints\nThe model\n\nThe non-supersymmetric, CP-conserving 2HDM (\"Model II\") [28] based on two doublets of\ncomplex, scalar-fields \u03c61 ,\u03c62 . This is a simple extension of the SM, in which only the Higgs\nsector is enlarged. To avoid possible large effects due to the flavour-changing neutral currents\n(FCNC), the 2HDM potential can be chosen in a Z2 -symmetric form, i.e. without (\u03c61 ,\u03c62 )\nmixing. In the general case, the potential can have terms, characterized by a mass parameter\n\u03bc, which break the Z2 symmetry softly; see e.g. [30, 31].\nThe 2HDM has five Higgs particles: two neutral Higgs scalars h and H, one neutral pseudoscalar A, and a pair of charged Higgses H \u00b1 . Their masses are free parameters of the model.\nOther parameters are: the angle \u03b1, which describes the mixing in the neutral Higgs-scalar sector; tan \u03b2 the ratio of two vacuum expectation values of scalar doublets, tan \u03b2 = v2 /v1 ; and the\nparameter \u03bc. Small values of \u03bc seem to be more natural from the point of view of the FCNC\neffects [30]. It is worth noticing that for such a case, a non-decoupling of the heavy Higgs sector\ncan be realized [30, 31].\nIn the 2HDM one can choose the Yukawa couplings in a few different ways. Here we consider\nthe Model (II) implementation, where one doublet of fundamental scalar fields couples to the\nu-type quarks, and the other to the d-type quarks and charged leptons. This way FCNC\nprocesses are avoided at the tree level [29, 28]. This Higgs sector is identical to the one in the\nMSSM; however, in the 2HDM (II) considered by us, there are no tree-level relations between\nparameters as in the MSSM case. Therefore even for very heavy supersymmetric particles, the\n2HDM (II) and MSSM have very different phenomenology.\n5\n\n\fTo be more specific, let us consider the ratios of the direct coupling constants of the Higgs\nboson h or H to the massive gauge bosons V = W or Z, as well as to the fermions (i.e.\nYukawa couplings) for the u-type quarks and d-type quarks and the charged leptons, to the\ncorresponding couplings for the SM. They are determined in terms of angles \u03b1 and \u03b2 [28, 30].\nFor \u03c7hi \u2261 gih /(gih)SM (and similarly for H) we have, in a form suitable for a simultaneous\ndiscussion of h and H:\n\u03c7hV = sin(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1),\n\u03c7hu = \u03c7hV + cot \u03b2\u03c7H\nV,\nh\nh\n\u03c7d = \u03c7V \u2212 tan \u03b2\u03c7H\nV,\n\n\u03c7H\nV = cos(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1),\nH\nh\n\u03c7u = \u03c7H\nV \u2212 cot \u03b2\u03c7V ,\nH\nh\n\u03c7H\nd = \u03c7V + tan \u03b2\u03c7V ,\n\n\u03c7A\nV = 0,\n\u03c7A\nu = \u2212i\u03b35 cot \u03b2,\n\u03c7A\nd = \u2212i\u03b35 tan \u03b2.\n\n(5)\n(6)\n(7)\n\n2\nHere we have (\u03c7hV )2 + (\u03c7H\nV ) = 1. Observe a pattern relation between these couplings (for h or\nH): (\u03c7u \u2212 \u03c7V )(\u03c7V \u2212 \u03c7d ) = 1 \u2212 \u03c72V , or (\u03c7u + \u03c7d )\u03c7V = 1 + \u03c7u \u03c7d , found in [30].\n\nFor \u03c7hV = 1 all couplings of h have the SM values, the couplings of H to gauge bosons\nare equal to zero, while one of the couplings of H to fermions may differ considerably from\nthe corresponding SM one, for a small or large tan \u03b2. If \u03c7H\nV = 1 then the H-boson has SM\nh\ncouplings, while h has very different properties: \u03c7V = 0 and the Yukawa coupling \u03c7hd can be\nlarge, for large values of tan \u03b2. This is a case that may correspond to a light-scalar scenario\ndiscussed below.\nThe Yukawa coupling \u03c7d , relevant to a Higgs boson coupling to a muon, plays a basic role\nin the calculation of the 2HDM contribution to a\u03bc . It is equal (up to a factor \u2212i\u03b35 ) to tan \u03b2 for\na pseudoscalar and H + . If in addition \u03c7hV = sin(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1) = 0, then the same holds for a scalar h;\nmore precisely then |\u03c7hd | = tan \u03b2 (see eq. (7)). In the calculation of the two-loop contribution\nto a\u03bc , the coupling of H + to a scalar h is involved as well, and it is given by\n\u03c7hH +\n\nMh2\n= 1\u2212\n2MH2 +\n\n!\n\n\u03c7hV +\n\nMh2 \u2212 \u03bc2 h\n(\u03c7d + \u03c7hu ),\n2MH2 +\n\n(8)\n\nwith the same normalization as that for an elementary charged scalar particle in the SM. For\n\u03c7hV = 0 one gets \u03c7hH + = (\u03c7hd \u2212 1/\u03c7hd )(Mh2 \u2212 \u03bc2 )/(2MH2 + ). We see that this coupling depends on\nthe parameter \u03bc. In this paper we consider only the case with \u03bc = 0. A more general case will\nbe studied elsewhere.\n\n3.2\n\nExisting constraints\n\nMany searches for a light Higgs particle in the 2HDM (II) were performed at various energies\nand machines; the most systematic studies were performed at LEP. All existing LEP data, see\nfor instance [27, 32, 33, 34, 35], allows for the existence of one light neutral Higgs boson, h or\nA, with a mass even below 20 GeV. According to the results presented in the left panel of Fig.\n1, the other Higgs particle (A or h, respectively) should be heavy enough to avoid the exclusion\nregion in the (Mh , MA ) plane, given roughly by Mh + MA \u2265 90 GeV.\nThis is in contrast to the case of the SM Higgs boson, which should be heavier than 114.4\nGeV (95% CL). Also the MSSM Higgs particles should be heavier than \u223c 90 GeV [32].

Right: The upper limit on the\n(\u03c7hV )2 (DELPHI preliminary results [34]).\nanalysis of the Bjorken process leads to an upper limit on the coupling of h to the gauge boson\n\u03c7hV . This limit, obtained at 95% CL, is presented in the right panel of Fig. 1. We see that this\n< 50 GeV. The Yukawa couplings \u03c7d of a very light\ncoupling is much smaller than 1 for Mh \u223c\nscalar or of a very light pseudoscalar, with mass below 10 GeV, are constrained in the form\nof upper limits by the low-energy data [36, 37], whereas LEP experiments [35] do that for for\nmasses >\n\u223c 4 GeV (see Figs. 4, 5). It is only the analysis of the decay Z \u2192 h/A\u03b3 at LEP [27]\nthat gives both the upper and lower limits for |\u03c7d |. Note that |\u03c7d | is equal to tan \u03b2 for A and,\nif \u03c7hV = 0, also for h.\nThe constraints from the \u03a5 \u2192 h(A)\u03b3 process, mentioned above, have been measured by a\nfew groups [36]. We present their results in Fig. 4 (lines denoted by K, N and L). Unfortunately,\nthe corresponding predictions have large experimental and theoretical uncertainties, the latter\nones both being due to the QCD and relativistic corrections. Nevertheless, as we will see\nbelow, the constraints coming from this process, even when accounting for some additional\nuncertainties, play an important role in closing a low mass window for the scalar h.\nFinally, note that in the 2HDM there is an important lower limit on the mass of H + , coming\nfrom the NLO analysis of the b \u2192 s\u03b3 data, given by MH + \u2265 500 GeV at 95% CL [39].\n\n4\n\nConstraining 2HDM(II) by g \u2212 2 for the muon data\n\nWe apply the \u03b4a\u03bc , obtained in sec. 2, to constrain parameters of the 2HDM (II) (see also\nearlier papers [26, 41, 40]). We assume that the lightest Higgs boson, h or A, dominates the\nfull 2HDM (II) contribution, i.e. we have a2HDM\n\u2248 ah\u03bc , or aA\n\u03bc\n\u03bc (a simple approach in [26]).\n7\n\n\fThis approach should hold for masses below 50 GeV, according to results presented in the left\npanel of Fig. 1. For higher masses, which are also considered here, this is essentially equivalent to assuming a large mass gap between the lightest one, h or A, and the remaining Higgs\nbosons, which lead to a light-h or a light-A scenario. The relevant one- and two-loop diagrams,\nstudied in [5, 26, 40] and [41, 26], respectively, are shown in Fig. 2 for the h and A contributions.\n\u03b3\n\n\u03b3\n\nf (W + , H + )\nh, A\n\nh, A\n\u03bc\n\n\u03bc\n\n\u03bc\n\n\u03b3\n\u03bc\n\nFigure 2: One- and two-loop (W + and H + loops are only for a h-exchange) diagrams.\n\nAccording to the LEP limits, discussed in sec. 3.2, we assume that h does not couple to\nW/Z, and therefore we neglect the W -loop in the light-h scenario. We include, however, an\nH + -loop with MH + equal to 400, 800 GeV (and for \u03bc = 0).\nIn Fig. 3 we present the contributions to a\u03bc obtained for an h (solid lines) and for a A\n(dashed lines), assuming Yukawa couplings \u03c7d equal to 1. For both h and A, the one-loop\n[5, 26, 40] and two-loop [41, 26] results are shown separately. For the purpose of comparison,\na one-loop H + contribution is presented. The one-loop diagram gives a positive contribution\nto a\u03bc for a scalar, whereas it is negative for a pseudoscalar, independently of the value of\nthe Higgs-boson mass. The signs of the two-loop contributions are reversed, these diagrams\ncontribute negatively (positively) for a h (A) case [41]. These two-loop diagrams can give large\ncontributions, since they allow us to avoid one small Yukawa coupling with a muon in favor\nof a coupling with other, potentially heavy, particles circulating in the loop [42, 41]. Indeed,\nthe contributions of two-loop diagrams dominate over the corresponding one-loop ones when\nthe mass of h or A is above a few GeV, as shown in Fig. 3. As a result, in the two-loop\nanalysis, based on a sum of the one- and two-loop (fermionic and bosonic) contributions, a\npositive (negative) contribution can be ascribed to a scalar h with mass below (above) 5 GeV\nor a pseudoscalar A with mass above (below) 3 GeV.\n2\nIn our calculation, ah\u03bc and aA\n\u03bc contain contributions proportional either to \u03c7d , equivalently to\nh\nh\ntan \u03b2 for A and for h (if \u03c7V = 0), or to \u03c7d \u03c7u = \u22121. Assuming a\u03bc = \u03b4a\u03bc for a light-h scenario,\nand aA\n\u03bc = \u03b4a\u03bc for a light-A one, and using the estimate of the interval \u03b4a\u03bc from table 2, we can\nderive constraints on tan \u03b2, for h and A. They are, as expected, in the form of allowed regions\n(the area between thick lines in Fig. 4) for masses below 5 GeV for h, shown in the left panel\nof Fig. 4, and for masses above 3 GeV for A, the right panel of Fig. 4 (see also [41]).\n2\n\n8\n\n\fcontribution to (g-2)/2 for muon\n1000\n100\n\nh ___\nA---\n\nh&A: one-loop\n\ndelta a_mu\n\n10\n1\n0.1\n0.01\n\nh&A: two-loop\nH+:\none-loop\n\n3\n2\n1\n\n0.001\n0.0001\n1e-05\n0.1\n\nin 10^{-11}\n1\n10\nM_h(A,H+), GeV\n\n100\n\nFigure 3: The (absolute value of) individual contributions to a\u03bc from a scalar h (solid line),\na pseudoscalar A (dashed line) and a charged Higgs boson H + (dotted line).

For\nh also, results with an additional contribution due to the H + -loop are shown: line \"2\" (\"3\")\ncorresponds to MH + =800 (400) GeV.\n\n5\n\nCombined 95% CL constraints\n\nThe 95% CL constraints from the (g\u22122)\u03bc are presented in Fig. 4 (area between thick lines in the\nleft and right panels) together with current upper limits from LEP, from the Yukawa processes\n[35] (see ALEPH, DELPHI and OPAL results). Also the lower limits from the Z \u2192 h(A)\u03b3 [27]\ncan be seen in Fig. 4. In addition, the upper 90% CL limits from the \u03a5 decay (lines denoted\nK,N and L, with the K results rescaled by a factor 2, as discussed in [26]) and from the Tevatron\n[38], are presented as well.\nWe see that our two-loop analysis, based on the latest (g \u2212 2)\u03bc data and on the FJ02\nestimation of ahad\n(vp1), if combined with constraints from other experiments, allows for the\n\u03bc\nexistence, in the 2HDM (II), of a pseudoscalar with mass between \u223c 25 GeV and 70 GeV, and\ntan \u03b2 above \u223c 25. The mass region for A allowed by (g \u2212 2)\u03bc data, between \u223c 3 and 25 GeV, is\nexcluded by the constraints from LEP, based on OPAL and DELPHI data. On the other hand\nthe constraints from the Tevatron close the pseudoscalar-mass window above 70 GeV. For a\nlight scalar the combined constraints are even more severe; if the old constraints from the \u03a5\ndecay data are taken into account, the area allowed by the latest (g \u22122)\u03bc data disappears.

See text for details.\n\n10\n\n\f6\n\nConclusions and outlook\n\nUsing the latest precise measurement of the (g \u2212 2)\u03bc and comparing it with the improved,\ntheoretical estimations of the SM contribution, we derive the 95% CL \u03b4a\u03bc interval to be used\nto constrain an additional contribution to a\u03bc , beyond the SM ones. It allows one to constrain\nstrongly the additional contribution, which arises in a CP-conserving, non-supersymmetric\n2HDM (II) for a small parameter \u03bc, studied in this paper. The additional contribution, allowed\nat 95% CL, has to have a positive sign, and can lead to a clear prediction for a light-scalar and\na light-pseudoscalar scenario in the model considered here. These two scenarios correspond to\nthe case when one of the Higgs bosons, h or A, is very light, much lighter than the other Higgs\nparticles of the model. It should be further noted that both of these scenarios are in agreement\nwith existing data from other experiments. An exchange of such light particle dominates in\nthe one- and two-loop contributions to the a\u03bc . Constraints from (g \u2212 2)\u03bc are such that they\nexclude a light h with a mass above 5 GeV and a light A if its mass is below 3 GeV, as the\ncorresponding contributions are negative in these regions.\nOur two-loop analysis presented in this paper is based on the newest (g \u2212 2)\u03bc data and on\nthe (preliminary) FJ02 estimation of ahad\n\u03bc . Combining the constraints from the (g \u2212 2)\u03bc data\nwith those from other experiments, a pseudoscalar with mass between \u223c 25 GeV and 70 GeV\n<\nand 25 <\n\u223c tan \u03b2 \u223c 115 is allowed. However, a light scalar is excluded.\nThe main results will hold also if the g \u22122 constraints are based on the HMNT results for the\nvp1. For the HMNT(in) case the window for a pseudoscalar will be even smaller: 35 \u2264 MA \u2264 70\nGeV and tan \u03b2 between 40 and 120. The results will not change significantly, if the uncertainty\nfor the lbl contribution is up two times larger than in the estimation we used in the analysis.\nIf such an error is still added in quadrature, then the lower bounds go down, with respect to\nresults given in Fig. 4, by a factor \u223c 1.4. There will be no visible changes in the upper bounds.\nFinally, we stress a need for a coherent and comprehensive error analysis for the SM contributions to the a\u03bc (see a very recent paper [44]).\n\nAcknowledgements\nI am grateful to Fred Jegerlehner and Thomas Teubner for many valuable discussions of the\nrecent results on the g \u2212 2 for the muon.
