In recent years, we used lattice QCD to calculate some quantities that were\nunknown or poorly known. They are the q 2 dependence of the form factor in semileptonic\nD \u2192 Kl\u03bd decay, the leptonic decay constants of the D+ and Ds mesons, and the mass of the\nBc meson. In this paper, we summarize these calculations, with emphasis on their (subsequent)\nconfirmation by measurements in e+ e\u2212 , \u03b3p and p\u0304p collisions\n\n1. Introduction and Background\nThe central theme of elementary particle physics is to find new interactions of matter, energy,\nspace and time. When the matter in question is the quarks, one is faced with quark confinement:\nquarks never appear freely; they are always bound inside hadrons-baryons like the proton, or\nmesons like the pion or kaon. In the Standard Model of elementary particles, confinement is a\nphenomenon of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the gauge theory of the strong force.\nSince only hadrons can be detected, the effects of quark confinement must be calculated with\nQCD, before the experimental data can be interpreted in terms of quarks. In many cases, the\nbest technique for doing the calculations is to formulate QCD on a space-time lattice. Lattice\nQCD and the Feynman path integral reduce the problem of to an integral whose dimension\nscales as N 4 , where N is the (linear) lattice size. The problem cries out for supercomputing.\nIn recent years, lattice QCD has reached the stage where many calculations of hadron masses,\nmass splittings and operator matrix elements agree with experimental measurements. The key\nhas been the inclusion of sea quarks, which are pairs of virtual quarks swirling around inside\nhadrons. The progress has been especially striking [1] when the sea quarks are implemented as\nstaggered quarks, using an action designed to reduce discretization effects.\nOne ingredient of these calculations is controversial. Sea quarks are always computationally\ndemanding, although staggered quarks are by far the fastest. Staggered quarks introduce some\nextra unwanted quarks, however. The computer algorithms [2] and subsequent analysis of the\nnumerical data [3] remove them, but do so differently for valence and sea quarks. The difference\ncan lead to violations of unitarity. In the cases discussed here, it is plausible that such effects\nare small, but a proof is not yet at hand [4].\nLess controversial is the treatment of heavy quarks. In practice, the lattice spacing is not\nsmall enough to resolve the Compton wavelength of charmed and b quarks. Fortunately,\nchromodynamics at this length scale is simple enough to factor it out from the computer\nsimulation, and several methods exist [5]. Nevertheless, it is good to have check.\n\n\fIn this paper, we discuss three topics: the normalization and q 2 -dependence of the D \u2192 Kl\u03bd\nform factor; the decay constants of the D + and Ds mesons; and the mass of the Bc meson. Each\nof these lattice-QCD calculations was subsequently confirmed by experimental measurements,\nsatisfying a long-standing demand of experimental physicists [6]. The quantities discussed here\nwere ideal candidates: they are straightforward to compute; they test the controversial aspects\nin complementary ways; and the first \"good\" experimental measurements were expected on the\nsame time scale. The success of the predictions is extremely encouraging. In particular, the\ncalculations for D mesons are, in lattice QCD, similar to those for B mesons, whose b quarks\nare considered likely to exhibit new, non-Standard interactions.\n2. Semileptonic D Decays\nSemileptonic decays such as D \u2192 Kl\u03bd proceed as follows. A quark (in this case, a charmed\nquark) emits a virtual W boson, thereby turning into a quark of a different flavor (in this case,\na strange quark). The W immediately disintegrates into a lepton-neutrino (l\u03bd) pair. The rate\ndepends on q 2 , which is the invariant-mass-squared of l\u03bd. Some of the q 2 dependence stems from\nQCD through a function called a form factor (in this case, denoted f+ (q 2 )). The momentum\n2\n= (mD \u2212 mK )2 . In lattice QCD, discretization effects\ntransfer q 2 falls in the range 0 \u2264 q 2 \u2264 qmax\n2 .\nare smallest when the spatial momentum p of the kaon is small, which puts q 2 close to qmax\nExperiments usually measure the branching fraction and quote the normalization f+ (0),\nafter making assumptions about the q 2 dependence. While our results were still preliminary [7],\nexperimental results came out for the normalization of D \u2192 Kl\u03bd [8] and D \u2192 \u03c0l\u03bd [9]. The\nagreement with our final results [10] is excellent. For example, we find f+D\u2192K (0) = 0.73(3)(7) [10]\nwhile the BES Collaboration measures f+D\u2192K (0) = 0.78(5) [8].\nIn principle, the shape of the form factors can be computed directly in lattice QCD. In\npractice, we calculated at a few values of p and used a fit to the Ansatz of Be\u0107irevi\u0107-Kaidalov\n(BK) [11] to fix the q 2 dependence. It was important, therefore, to measure the q 2 dependence\nexperimentally. In photoproduction of charm off fixed nuclear targets, the FOCUS Collaboration\nwas able to collect high enough statistics to trace out the q 2 distribution of the decay [12].\nThis setup does not yield an absolutely normalized branching ratio, so one is left to compare\nf+ (q 2 )/f+ (0).\nIn Fig. 1(a) we plot our result for f+ (q 2 )/f+ (0) vs. q 2 /m2Ds\u2217 . The errors from f+ (0) must\nbe propagated to non-zero q 2 , so for f+ (q 2 )/f+ (0) the errors grow with q 2 .

As one\ncan see, the q 2 dependence of lattice QCD (curve and error band) and data from the FOCUS\nexperiment (points) agree excellently, although the uncertainties are still several per cent. The\nFOCUS results appeared two months after the lattice calculation. More recently, the Belle\nCollaboration at the e+ e\u2212 collider KEK-B measured the shape and normalization of the form\nfactor in a single experiment [14]. In Fig. 1(b) we compare our result for f+ (q 2 ) with Belle. The\ncolor code for the lattice QCD error bands is as before, and now depict q 2 dependence of the\nlattice-QCD errors in a realistic way.\n3. Leptonic D Decays\nWe also considered the leptonic decay of charmed mesons, D + \u2192 l\u03bd and Ds \u2192 l\u03bd. Here the\nquark and antiquark in the meson merge into a virtual W , which disintegrates into l\u03bd. The\nQCD influence is a single number (for each meson), called decay constants and denoted fD+\nor fDs . At Lattice 2004 [15], we presented preliminary results for fD+ and fDs , based on one\nlattice spacing, a \u2248 0.125 fm. Our extended the running to two other lattice spacings. Details\nare given in the ensuing publication [16]. We find\nfD+ = 201 \u00b1 3 \u00b1 17 MeV,\nfDs = 249 \u00b1 3 \u00b1 16 MeV,\n\n(1)\n(2)\n\nwhere the first error is from finite Monte Carlo statistics, the second is a sum in quadrature\nof several systematics. A conservative (but not na\u00efve) estimate of heavy-quark discretizations\neffects is the second largest (largest) systematic on fD+ (fDs ).\nFigure 2 shows the nf dependence of the decay constants. Quenched (nf = 0) results vary\nwidely, but we show one [17] carried out with similar choices for other aspects of the calculations.\nOne sees a trend of fDs to increase with nf . A similar comparison of fD+ , in Fig. 2(b), is less\ninstructive, but shown for completeness.\nThe CLEO-c Collaboration [19] and the BaBar Collaboration [20] have measured\nfD+ = 223 \u00b1 17 \u00b1 3 MeV CLEO-c [19],\nfDs = 279 \u00b1 17 \u00b1 20 MeV BaBar [20],\n\n(3)\n(4)\n\nrespectivelty at the CESR and PEP-II e+ e\u2212 colliders.

Experimental and lattice-QCD\nuncertainties are reducible, so the test will sharpen over the coming few years.\n4. Mass of the Bc Meson\nThe pseudoscalar Bc+ meson is the lowest-lying bound state of a charmed quark and a b quark.\nThe CDF Collaboration [21] first observed it during Run I of the Tevatron p\u0304p collider in the\nsemileptonic decay Bc+ \u2192 J/\u03c8l+ \u03bd. But it was clear that Tevatron Run II detectors would\nbe able to reconstruct hadronic modes, such as Bc+ \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c0 + , which give much much better\nprecision on mBc [22]. At Lattice 2004 we presented results in nearly final form [23], and posted\nthe final results on the arXiv in mid-November [24]:\nmBc = 6304 \u00b1 12+18\n\u2212 0 MeV,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere the last error is a rough estimate of residual heavy-quark discretization effects. Soon\nafterwards, CDF announced their precise mass measurement [25]:\nmBc = 6287 \u00b1 5 MeV,\n\n(8)\n\nwhich agrees with Eq. (7) at slightly more than 1-\u03c3.\nTwo comments are in order. First, the agreement at the gross level of the calculation with\nexperiment shows that discretization effects are well under control with the heavy-quark methods\nof choice. These are lattice NRQCD [27] and the Fermilab method [28], which are based on\neffective field theories for heavy quarks [29, 30]. Indeed, as seen in Fig. 3(a), almost no lattice\nspacing dependence is seen in the splitting \u2206\u03c8\u03a5 = mBc \u2212 (m\u0304\u03c8 + m\u03a5 )/2 that is at the crux\nof the calculation [26]. Moreover, it is striking how little the splitting \u2206\u03c8\u03a5 changes when sea\nquarks are included. Figure 3(b) compares Eq. (7) with an old quenched calculation [26] (and the\nmeasurement [25]). The solid error bar shows the non-quenching errors, and the dashed includes\nthe estimate of the quenching error. The inclusion of sea quarks has reduced the splitting by a\nfactor of three or four, bringing an essentially discrepant result into agreement.\n5. Conclusions\nIn the past year, several lattice-QCD calculations have been confirmed by experiment. FOCUS\n[12] and Belle [14] confirmed the q 2 -dependence of the D \u2192 Kl\u03bd form factor [10]; CLEOc [19] and BaBar [20] respectively confirmed the D + and Ds decay constants [16]; and\nCDF [25] confirmed the mass of the Bc meson [24]. To obtain these results it is essential\nto have heavy-quark discretization effects under control, as one expects from theoretical\nfoundations [27, 28, 29, 30]. Furthermore, the comparison of quenched QCD, QCD with 2+1\nstaggered flavors, and experiment shows that sea quarks are needed to obtain agreement, and\n\n2\n\n40\n\n0.00\n\n(a)\n\nmBc (MeV/c )\n\n\u2206\u03c8\u03a5 (MeV)\n\n6600\n50\n\n0.05\n\n0.10\n\na (fm)\n\n0.15\n\nlattice QCD, Feb. 1999\nlattice QCD, Nov. 2004\nCDF, Dec. 2004\n\n6500\n6400\n6300\n\n0.20\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 3.

The results are promising for\nthe search for new b quark interactions, because a straighforward change to the D form factors\nand decay constants yield the corresponding results for B mesons. These are a key element to\nenable the experimental search for new phenomena in quark-flavor physics [6].\nAcknowledgments\nThis work has been supported in part by the U.S. National Science Foundation, the Office of\nScience of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), and the U.K. Particle Physics and Astronomy\nResearch Council.
