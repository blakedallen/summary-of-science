We discuss that the responsible mechanism to explain the phenomena\ncould be the percolation cluster formation and we expect appearance of deconfinement in the cluster.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe experimental results on the centrality [1]-[8] and energy [9]-[10] dependence of particle\nproduction in heavy ion ultrarelativistic collisions coming from the heavy ion physics\nprogram at the SPS CERN [11] and RHIC BNL [12] show regime change and saturation\nwhich could serve as evidence for the existence of a transition to a new phases of strongly\ninteracting matter.\nLet us consider some examples. The experimental ratios of the average values of\nmultiplicity of K + \u2212, K \u2212 \u2212, \u03c6- mesons, and \u039b-hyperons to the average values of multiplicity\nof \u03c0 \u00b1 - mesons as a function of centrality coming from SPS CERN are presented in\npaper [1]. The centrality was fixed using the average number of participant nucleons\n(< Npart >). They could obtaine that the ratios are increase with centrality and saturate\nin the area of < Npart > 60.\nA compilation of measurements of yields at midrapidity for the most abundant hadron\nspecies for central nucleus-nucleus (Au-Au or Pb-Pb) collisions are presented in paper[10].\nAs the centrality selection differs between various measurements, they have scaled the\ndata for the same number of participating nucleons, Npart=350. It is the point of regime\nchange and saturation effect from these data too.\nThe examples show the regime change and saturation in the behaviours of some characteristics of events as a function of centrality and colliding energies.\nIf the regime change observed in the different experiments would take place unambiguously two times, this would surely be the most direct experimental evidence seen so far\npointing to a phase transition from the normal hadronic matter to a phase of deconfined\nquarks and gluons. However, second point of regime change has not been observed clearly,\nmoreover the effect taken place for hadron-nuclear and for nuclear- nuclear interactions\ntoo. Let us met the data coming from the hadron-nuclear experiments.\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nHadron-nuclear interaction\n\nIn paper [3] the results are presented from BNL experiment E910 on pion production\nand stopping in proton-Be, Cu, and Au collisions as a function of centrality at a beam\nmomentum of 18 GeV/c. The centrality of the collisions was characterized using the\nmeasured number of grey tracks, Ngrey , and a derived quantity, \u03bd, the number of inelastic\nnucleon-nucleon scatterings suffered by the projectile during the collision. They obtained\nthat the \u03c0 \u2212 multiplicity increases approximately proportionally to Ngrey and \u03bd for all\nthree targets at small values of Ngrey or \u03bd and saturates with increasing Ngrey and \u03bd in the\nregion of more high values of Ngrey and \u03bd . They could observe that the wounded-nucleon\n(WN) model [3] did not explain the results. It was obtained that the measured \u039b yield\nincreased faster than the participant scaling expectation for \u03bd \u2264 3 and then saturated and\nthe deviation in strange particle production from a wounded-nucleon scaling. The same\nresult have been obtained by BNL E910 Collaboration for Ks0 and K + - mesons emitted\nin p+Au reaction.\nNow let us consider some example on nuclear-nuclear interactions.\n\n3\n\nNuclear-Nuclear Interaction\n\nThe average values of multiplicity < ns > for s - particles produced in Kr + Em reactions\nat 0.95 GeV/nucl as a function of centrality are presented in paper [5]. They could saw\nthat there are two regions in the behaviour of the values of < ns > as a function of Ng (a\nnumber of grey particles) for the Kr+Em reaction. In the region of : Ng < 40 the values\nof < ns > increase linearly with Ng , here the cascade evaporation model (CEM) [13] also\ngives the linear dependence but with the slope less than the experimental one; Ng > 40\nthe CEM gives the values for average ns greater than the experimental observed ones, the\nlast saturates in this region, the effect could not be described by the model. It have been\npreviously observed in emulsion experiments [6].\nIt is very important that the regime change has been indicated in the behaviour of\nheavy flavor particles production in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions as a function of\ncentrality. Next paragraph connects with these data.\n\n4\n\nRegime change and saturation in charmonium production.\n\nThe ratio of the charmonium to Drell-Yan cross-sections has been measured by NA38 and\nNA50 SPS CERN as a function of the centrality of the reaction estimated, for each event,\nfrom the measured neutral transverse energy Et [8]. Whereas peripheral events exhibit\nthe normal behavior already measured for lighter projectiles or targets, the charmonium\nshows a significant anomalous drop of about 20% in the Et range between 40 and 50 GeV.\nOther significant effect which was be seen by authors was a regime change in the Et\nrange between 40 and 50 GeV both for light and heavy ion collisions and saturation.\n\n2\n\n\f5\n\nResults.\n\nSo we could see that:\n1. The above motioned regime change had been observed:\n- at some values of centrality and colliding energy, as some critical phenomena;\n- for hadron-nuclear , nuclear-nuclear interactions and ultrarelativistic ion collisions;\n- in the range energy from SIS energy up to RHIC energy;\n- almost for all particles (from mesons, baryons, strange particles up to charmonium).\n2. After point of regime change the saturation is observed.\n3. The simple models (such us WN and CEM) which usually used to describe the high\nenergy hadron-nuclear and nuclear-nuclear interactions could not explain the existing of\nthe regime change point and saturation.\n\n6\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe results show that the dynamic of the phenomena should be same for hadron-nuclear,\nnuclear-nuclear and heavy ion interactions independent of the energy and mass of the\ncolliding nuclei and the types of particles.\nThe responsible mechanism to describe of the above mentioned phenomena could be\nstatistical and percolation ones because phenomena have a critical character. In talk [14]\nwas presented the complicate information about the using statistical and percolation\nmodels to explain the experimental results coming from heavy ion physics.\nThe regime change and saturation was observed for hadron-nuclear and light nuclearnuclear interaction where it is very hard and practically impossible to reach the necessary\nconditions to apply the statistical theory (the statistical models have to give the more\nstrong A-dependences than percolation mechanisms). That is way we believe that the\nresponsible mechanism for explain the phenomena could be the percolation cluster formation [15].\nBig percolation cluster could be formed in the hadron-nuclear, nuclear-nuclear and\nheavy ion interactions independent of the colliding energy. But the structure and the\nmaximum values of the reaching density and temperature of hadronic matter could be\ndifferent for different interactions depend on the colliding energy and masses in the framework of the cluster.\nPaper [16] discusses that deconfinement is expected when the density of quarks and\ngluons becomes so high that it no longer makes sense to partition them into color-neutral\nhadrons, since these would strongly overlap. Instead we have clusters much larger than\nhadrons, within which color is not confined; deconfinement is thus related to cluster formation. This is the central topic of percolation theory, and hence a connection between\npercolation and deconfinement seems very likely [17]. So we can see that the deconfinement could occur in the percolation cluster. Author explain the charmonium suppression\nas a result of deconfinment in cluster too.\n\n3\n\n\f7\n\nAppearance of the critical transparence of the\nstrongly interacting matter.\n\nThe heavy flavour particles are the most sensitive to phase transition and to formation of\nQGP. So the observing of the effects connected with formation and decay of the percolation\nclusters in heavy ion collisions at ultrarelativistic energies and studying the correlation between these effects and the effect of the charmonium suppression could be unambiguously\nconfirmation of the reaching the deconfinment of strongly interacting matter in cluster.\nPercolation cluster is a multibaryon system. With increasing the centrality of collisions\nits size and masses could increase as well as its absorption capability. So, for example, we\ncould see the decreasing the particle yields with increasing of the centrality. But instead\nit we could see the saturation. It could mean that after point of regime change the\nconduction of strongly interacting matter is increase and it becomes the superconductor.\nThe reason is that the conduction of the mutter increases and the matter becomes a\nsuperconductor [18] due to the formation of percolation cluster. Because of in those\nsystems the nucleons (quarks) must be bound as a result of the percolation.\n\n8\n\nSearch for signal\n\nThe critical changing of transparency of the strongly interacting matter could influence\non the characteristics of secondary particles changing them.\nAngular distribution of secondary particles could be more sensitive to the changing\nof the transparency of the matter and to the formation the big cluster. Because of the\nprobability of big percolation cluster formation have to be biggest in the central zone of\nthe collisions. So the particles which emitted in different distance from central zone of\ncollisions will be exposed to different changing. It could lead to the critical change of the\nangular correlations of the particle production because of the transparency the particles\nwill be absorbed differently depending on the angular. In talk [19] dN\ndistributions\ndy\nfor light charged particles (\u03c0, p, d, t) from Au+Au collisions in the range 2 - 8 AGeV at\nthe AGS (E895 Experiment) are presented. They wrote that as collision energy increases,\nbaryons retain more and more of the longitudinal momentum of the initial colliding nuclei.\nThis is characterized by a flattening of the invariant particle yields over a symmetric\nrange of rapidities, about the center of mass, and it is an indicator of the onset of nuclear\ntransparency.\n\n9\n\nSummary\n\nSo, in our opinion to confirm the deconfinment in cluster it could be necessary to study\nthe centrality dependence of behaviour of heavy flavour particles yield (appearance the\npoint of regime change and suppression) and simultaneously, critical increasing of the\ntransparency of the strongly interacting matter.\n\n4\n\n\fReferences\n[1] C.Alt, et al.
