This yields a new order two autoequivalence\nfor the Z2 quotient of the conifold.\n\n\f1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe nature of singularities has long been one of the central interesting questions in string\ntheory. One of the best techniques we have for understanding this has been to probe them\nwith D-branes. Thus, it is of great interest to understand the gauge theory that lives on\na D-brane situated at a singularity. This is particularly important in the context of the\nAdS/CFT conjecture wherein the most interesting gauge theories are obtained in such a\nmanner.\nWhile there have been a number of techniques used to derive such gauge theories, the\nmost powerful at present seems to be that of exceptional collections in derived categories.\nFirst referenced in [1] and initially developed by [2], this technique has been used to derive\nquivers for the gauge theories resulting from all collapsing del Pezzo surfaces in Calabi-Yaus.\nThe procedure in those references has now been substantially elucidated in the works of\n[3,4,5]. In particular, the last reference makes concrete most of the relevant mathematics.\nWhile the issues of superpotentials is still not completely worked out, we will see that in\nmany cases we can use physical insight to guess the correct answer.\nIn the AdS/CFT conjecture, we take a stack of D3-branes on R4 located at the tip of a\n6 (real-)dimensional cone with a Calabi-Yau metric of the form\nds2 = dr 2 + r 2 ds2M 5 .\n\n(1.1)\n\nWhen we take the near horizon limit of such a metric, it is easy to see that the resulting\ngeometry is AdS5 \u00d7M 5 . An interesting feature of the metric (1.1) is that the radial coordinate\nr does not have to extend to zero. Any CY metric of this form defines a Sasaki-Einstein (SE)\nstructure on M 5 . A characteristic feature of such metrics is that they have a nondegenerate\nvector field that can be integrated to a foliation of the 5-fold. These foliations can be\ndivided into three different types: (1) regular, where all the leaves have the same lengths; (2)\nquasiregular, where the leaves can have different lengths and (3) irregular, where the leaves\nare noncompact. In case (1), the space of leaves is a Fano1 K\u00e4hler-Einstein (KE) 2-fold, and\nin case (2) it is a Fano K\u00e4hler-Einstein orbifold. The last case remains mysterious, although\nsome examples have been recently investigated [6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14]. For the remainder of\nthis paper, we will deal only with the first case.\nIn both the first two cases, the 5-fold is the total space of a circle (V-)bundle over the\nbase. All smooth Fano, KE 2-folds are known. They are the third through eighth del Pezzo\nsurfaces2 , dP3 , . . . , dP8 , P2 and P1 \u00d7 P1 . All regular SE 5-folds are circle bundles over these\nspaces. It was shown by Friedrich and Kath [15] that the Euler class of these must integrally\ndivide the canonical class of the base. This gives the following complete classification. First,\nwe introduce the Fano index of a Fano variety, X. This is the largest natural number, I, such\nthat c1 (X)/I \u2208 H 2 (X, Z). The Fano index of all the del Pezzos is 1, so the only SE space is\nthe total space of the circle bundle corresponding to the canonical class. For P2 , the Fano\nindex is 3, so we have circle bundles corresponding to the canonical class and the canonical\nclass divided by three. These manifolds are easily seen to be S5 /Z3 and S5 respectively.\nFinally, the Fano index of P1 \u00d7 P1 is 2 and the corresponding 5-folds are denoted T 11 /Z2\n1\n2\n\nFano means that the the anticanonical line bundle is ample (positive).\nThe notation dPn refers to P2 blown up at n points.\n\n1\n\n\fand T 11 . In all these situations, the cone given by the metric (1.1) can be thought of as\n'filling in' the circle bundle, i.e., as the total space of the line bundle with same first Chern\nclass as the Euler class of the circle bundle. As noted earlier, the metric may not extend to\nthe zero section of this line bundle.\nWhile all these SE 5-folds are relevant for the AdS/CFT conjecture, the techniques given\nin [3,4,5] only work for the case of the canonical bundle. The reason for this is that, in order\nto work at large volume, we must be able to blow up the base of the cone. However, the\nCY metric only extends to the zero section when the canonical class of the cone is trivial\nwhich implies that the bundle must be the total space of the canonical bundle of the base.\nHowever, all hope is not lost for the other two cases. In each case, the singularity we obtain\nwhen we collapse the 'tip' of the cone to a point has an alternate resolution. For T 11 , the\ncone is the conifold with its well-known resolution to O(\u22121) \u2295 O(\u22121) \u2192 P1 . For S 5 , the\ncone is just C3 which needs no resolution.\nWhile it is possible to analyze these two cases in terms of their CY resolutions, we will\ngo a different route in this paper in the hope that the techniques developed will eventually\nbe applicable to the less well-understood quasiregular case. We will exploit the fact that the\ncanonical circle bundle is always an orbifold when the Fano index is greater than one. This\nsuggests that we can interpret the quivers obtained by the techniques of [3,4,5] as orbifolds of\nthe quivers we desire. We will show how this can be accomplished and show that it obtains\nthe correct answers for S5 and T 11 .\nThe paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we introduce exceptional collections and\nhelices and show how to obtain quiver gauge theories from them. We make a conjecture\nas to the form of the superpotential. In section 3, we present an algorithm to undo the\norbifold of the quiver, and we show that it gives the correct results. In section 4, we use\nthe simpler example of C\u2217 bundles to motivate the algorithm and to introduce some orbifold\ntechniques. In section 5, we show how we can use the McKay correspondence to treat\nthe derived category of coherent sheaves on the total space of the canonical bundle as an\nequivariant derived category. In section 6, we conjecture a Fourier-Mukai transform that\nimplements the action of the orbifold group on the derived category and show how this\njustifies the algorithm presented in section 3.\n\n2.\n\nExceptional collections, helices and quivers\n\nWe will assume familiarity with the language of derived categories. Excellent references\non the subject are Aspinwall's review [16] and the textbooks [17,18]. Because exceptional\ncollections are well established in this area, we will be brief in our review. For more details,\nsee [3,4] and references therein.\n\n2\n\n\f2.1.\n\nExceptional collections and quivers\n\nAn exceptional object, E, in a derived category3 satisfies the following identities:\nHom(E, E) = C ,\nHom(E, E[k]) = Extk (E, E) = 0 for k 6= 0 .\n\n(2.1)\n\nAn exceptional collection is an ordered collection of exceptional objects, Ei , i = 0 . . . n\u22121,\nsuch that\ni > j \u21d2 Extk (Ei , Ej ) = 0 \u2200k \u2208 Z .\n(2.2)\nAn exceptional collection is called full if it generates the triangulated category and is\ncalled strong if\nExtk (Ei , Ej ) = 0 \u2200k 6= 0 \u2200i, j .\n(2.3)\nIt was shown by Bondal [19] that, given the data of an full, strong exceptional collection of\nobjects in a triangulated category, we can construct a quiver such that the derived category\nof representations of the quiver is equivalent to the original triangulated category. For our\npurposes, the original triangulated category will always be the derived category of coherent\nsheaves on some variety, X. Thus, we have an equivalence of triangulated categories D(X) \u223c\n=\nD(A \u2212 Mod) where we identify representations of the quiver with modules of the quiver\nalgebra, A.\nThe construction proceeds as follows. Given a full, strong exceptional collection, let us\nform the object\nn\u22121\nM\nT =\nEi .\n(2.4)\ni=0\n\nThen, the endomorphism algebra of this object is the algebra of a quiver with relations. In\nfact, it will be more useful to look at the opposite algebra4 , so we define\nAop = Hom(T, T ) .\n\n(2.5)\n\nWe will assume familiarity with the theory of representations of quivers.5 Recall that\nthere are two types of distinguished representations of a quiver associated to any given node.\nFirst, there is the simple representation, Si , given by a one dimensional vector space at that\nnode with all maps equal to zero. Second, there is the projective representation, Pi , where,\nassociated to the node labelled j, we have a vector space with basis given by the set of paths\nfrom node i to node j. The maps are given by concatenation. With these definitions, we\nhave the identification\nHom(Ei , Ej ) \u223c\n= Hom(Pi , Pj ) = paths from j to i .\n3\n\nReally, any triangulated category.\nThis essentially interchanges the roles of left and right modules.\n5\nFor an extensive reference, see [20]. For the relevant parts, see [4].\n4\n\n3\n\n(2.6)\n\n\fO(1)\nxx FZi FFFF\nxxxxx\u2022\nF b\n\nO\u2022\n\naixxxxxx\nxxxxxxxx\nx\nx\nu\u0004xx\n\nFFFFFFj\nFFFFFF\nFFFF\n\n\u2022 O(2)\n\nFigure 1: The quiver for P2 .\nO(0, 1)\nw `h\nwwww\u2022 HHHHH\n\nO\u2022\n\nai wwwww\nww\nw\nwww\nw\u007f wwww\n\nHHHHbj\nHHHH\nHHHH\nH\n6> O(1, 1)\nvv \u2022\nv\nv\nv\nv\nv\nv\nv\nvvvvc\nvvvvv k\n\u2022\n\nO(1, 2)\n\nFigure 2: The quiver for P1 \u00d7 P1 .\nLet us now work out the quivers in the two examples that will be the focus of this paper.\nFirst, for P2 , a full, strong exceptional collection is (O, O(1), O(2)). It is easy to compute\nHom(O, O(1)) = Hom(O(1), O(2)) = C3 ,\nHom(O, O(2)) = C6 .\n\n(2.7)\n\nThis tells us that the quiver is the one given in figure 1. To determine the relations, we note\nthat the maps in equation (2.7) are simply multiplication by sections of O(1). The relations\ncome from the fact that this multiplication is commutative, i.e., xy = yx \u2208 H 0 (O(2)) for\nx, y \u2208 H 0 (O(1)). Thus, using the labels in the diagram, we have the relations ai bj = aj bi ,\ni, j = 1, 2, 3. This can be succinctly written as \u01ebijk aj bk = 0.\nIn the case of P1 \u00d7 P1 , we will work with the full, strong exceptional collection\n(O, O(0, 1), O(1, 1), O(1, 2)) .\n\n(2.8)\n\nHere, O(a, b) denotes the sheaf O(a) \u22a0 O(b). It is a short exercise to verify that the quiver\nis given as in figure 2 with the relations ai bj ck = ak bj ci , i, j, k = 1, 2. We can summarize this\nas \u01ebik ai bj ck = 0.\n2.2.\n\nCompleting the quiver\n\nNow that we have quivers corresponding to the 2-folds, we need to understand how to obtain\nquivers corresponding to the full cones. In particular, we will work with the total space of\nthe canonical line bundle, denoted by KX for the 2-fold X. Following Aspinwall [4], we\nwill describe a somewhat ad hoc procedure for obtaining the correct quiver. Please see the\noriginal paper for more details.\nWe will show the next section how to obtain a collection of objects in D(X), Si , dual to\nthe exceptional collection Ei . These objects correspond to the simple representations of the\n\n4\n\n\fO(1)\nxx FZi FFFF\nxxxxx\u2022\nF b\n\nO\u2022\n\naixxxxxx\nxxxxxxxx\nx\nx\nu\u0004xx\n\nck\n\nFFFFFFj\nFFFFFF\nFFFF\n_*4\n\n\u2022 O(2)\n\nFigure 3: The completed quiver for P2 .\nO(0, 1)\nw `h\nwwww\u2022 HHHHH\n\nO\n\nHHHHbj\nai wwwww\nHHHH\nwwww\nw\nHHHH\nw\nw\nw\nw\nH\nw\n6>\u2022 O(1, 1)\n\u2022GGw\u007f GGGGG\nv\nv\nv\nGGGG\nvvv\nv\nGGGG\nv\nv\nvv\ndl GGGGG vvvvvv ck\n\u2022\u001f' v\n\nO(1, 2)\n\nFigure 4: The completed quiver for P1 \u00d7 P1 .\nquiver. Some useful properties of these representations (see, for example, [4]) are\ndim Ext1 (Si , Sj ) = nij\ndim Ext2 (Si , Sj ) = rij\ndim Ext3 (Si , Sj ) = rrij\n..\n.\n\n.\n\n(2.9)\n\nHere, nij is the number of arrows (not paths) from node i to node j in the quiver, rij is the\nnumber of relations between paths that go from node i to node j and rrij is the number of\nrelations between relations, ad infinitum.\nTensoring with one of these representations adds one to the dimension of the vector space\nat a given node. In the gauge theory, this corresponds to adding one to the rank of the gauge\ngroup at the node. This allows us to identify these representations with the fractional branes\nin the string theory. We only must embed them in the cone KX to obtain the correct answer.\nLet s denote the zero section of the bundle KX . Then, the relevant objects are s\u2217 (Si ).\nThere exists a spectral sequence that gives us the Ext groups between these objects\n[4,21,22]. It gives\nExtiKX (s\u2217 (Si ), s\u2217 (Sj )) = ExtiX (Si , Sj ) \u2295 Ext3\u2212i\nX (Sj , Si ) .\n\n(2.10)\n\nIn order to avoid tachyons, we have to work with quivers that do not have any Ext3 s. What\nthis equation then tells us is that, for any relation in the quiver for X, we must draw a line\nin the opposite direction in the quiver for KX . We will call this new quiver the 'completed\nquiver'. Also, for any arrow in the original quiver, we have a relation in the completed\nquiver going in the opposite direction. Finally, we have relations between the relations at\nevery node. The completed quivers for P2 and P1 \u00d7 P1 are given in figures 3 and 4.\nIt now remains to determine the relations of the completed quiver. To do this rigorously\nis difficult, possibly involving higher products in the algebra of Ext groups.6 We can easily\n6\n\nSome computations of superpotentials in this context appear in [23].\n\n5\n\n\fguess a set of relations that satisfy the aforementioned properties, however. The key is to\nremember that relations in quiver gauge theories correspond to F-terms in the gauge theory\nand as such are given as the derivatives of a superpotential. P\nLet us write the set of relations\na\nof the quiver for X as R = 0 where a ranges from 1 to\nrij . Equation (2.10) tells us\nthat, for each of these relations, we add a new arrow to the completed quiver which we will\ndenote ra . Note that any relation is a sum of paths from a node i to a node j while the\ncorresponding added arrow points from j to i. Thus, the quantity\nX\nW =\nra R a\n(2.11)\na\n\nis gauge invariant in the quiver gauge theory. This is the superpotential, and the relations\nfor the completed quiver are derived from it as\n\u2202W\n=0\n\u2202ai\n\n(2.12)\n\nwhere ai ranges over all arrows in the completed quiver. It is easy to see that this set of\nrelations obeys all the properties implied by the equation (2.10).\nApplying this to our examples, we obtain for P2 :\nW = \u01ebijk ai bj ck ,\n\n(2.13)\n\nW = \u01ebik \u01eblj al bi cj dk .\n\n(2.14)\n\nand for P1 \u00d7 P1 :\nThese are the well-known, correct superpotentials for these examples.\n2.3.\n\nMutations and helices\n\nIn order to justify the preceding manipulations and to identify the algebra of the completed\nquiver, we must first introduce the notions of a mutation and a helix.\nThere are in fact two notions of a mutation that we will need. We will begin by describing\na mutation in a triangulated category. Given two objects, E and F , we define the left\nmutation, LE F , by the triangle\nLE F \u2212\u2192 Hom(E, F ) \u2297 E \u2212\u2192 F\n\n(2.15)\n\nwhere the second arrow is the evaluation map. It is not hard to see that, given an exceptional\npair, (E, F ), the pair, (LE F, E), is also exceptional. This defines a braid group action on\nexceptional collections [24]. We can similarly define a right mutation, but we will not need\nit here.\nIn fact, if the objects E and F are both the images of coherent sheaves in the derived\ncategory, the object LE F will often have a single nonzero cohomology sheaf. This can be\nproven to be the case7 when our variety has no rigid torsion sheaves and h0 (\u2212KX ) \u2265 2. As\n7\n\nThis is a sufficient but not necessary condition.\n\n6\n\n\fthis will always be the case here, let us define a new object LsE F , the left sheaf mutation, to\nbe this cohomology sheaf. A more proper definition is given in [25].\nWe can now define the dual objects mentioned in the previous section. Given an exceptional collection (E0 , . . . , En ), we can define the new collection\n(F0 , . . . , Fn ) = (Ln En , Ln\u22121 En\u22121 , . . . , LE0 E1 , E0 ) .\n\n(2.16)\n\nThe notation Ln refers to n applications of left mutation (not sheaf mutations). For example,\nL2 E2 = LE0 LE1 E2 . These obey [5,19]\nExtk (Ei , Fn\u2212j [j]) = C\u03b4ij \u03b4k0 .\n\n(2.17)\n\nThis gives us the dual collection8 , Sj = Fn\u2212j [j]. For the collection (O, O(1), O(2)) over P2 ,\nthe dual collection, Si , is given by (\u03a90 , \u03a91 (1)[1], \u03a92 (2)[2]). For the collection (2.8), the dual\ncollection is (O, O(\u22121, 0)[1], O(1, \u22121)[1], O(0, \u22121)[2]).\nAlso, given an exceptional collection (E0 , . . . , En ), we can take the rightmost element En\nand mutate it to the far left giving the new exceptional collection (E\u22121 , . . . , En\u22121 ). It is a\ntheorem of Bondal [19] that, if the exceptional collection is full, i.e., generates the derived\ncategory, then\nE\u22121 = Ln En = En \u2297 K[m \u2212 n]\n(2.18)\nwhere m is the dimension of the variety that we are working on.\nBondal [19] defines a helix as a collection of objects, Ei , i = \u2212\u221e, . . . , \u221e, such that\nEi = Ei+n \u2297 K[m \u2212 n] .\n\n(2.19)\n\nIn particular, this defines a helix of length n + 1. The relation (2.18) shows that any full\nexceptional collection is the basis of a helix that can be formed by left (and right) mutations.\nThis, however, does not seem to be the most appropriate definition of a helix.9 In fact,\nmost of the theorems about helices are proven [26] in the case m = n in the above notation.\nAs we will see, a better notion of a helix is a collection of sheaves, rather than objects in the\nderived category, that obey\nEi = Ei+n \u2297 K .\n(2.20)\nGiven an exceptional collection of length n + 1, we can use the notion of sheaf mutation to\ndefine one of these helices by E\u22121 = (Ls )n En and the corresponding relation for right sheaf\nmutations. We will use the term helix solely to refer to a collection of sheaves that obey\n(2.20). This sort of helix appears, for example, in [25].\nBondal and Polishchuk [26] call a helix geometric if, for all i \u2264 j, it obeys\nHom(Ei , Ej [k]) = 0 unless k = 0 .\n\n(2.21)\n\nBridgeland [5] calls these helices simple, and we will follow his usage. Note that, while we\nare applying Bondal's definition to our modified version of a helix, it still makes sense. In\n8\n\nIn most of the literature, the F s are referred to as the dual collection. However, the Ss are the important\nobjects for us, so we prefer to reserve the term dual for them.\n9\nIn this context, this fact has also been observed by Christopher Herzog and Tom Bridgeland to my\nknowledge.\n\n7\n\n\ffact, Bondal and Polishchuk [26] show that, for their definition of a helix, it can only be\ngeometric/simple in the case that m = n, i.e., when it is also a helix under our definition.\nFor our two running examples, on P2 , we have the simple helix Ei = O(i) and on P1 \u00d7P1\n. . . , O(\u22121, \u22121), O(\u22121, 0), O, O(0, 1), O(1, 1), O(1, 2), O(2, 2), O(2, 3), . . . .\n2.4.\n\n(2.22)\n\nDeriving the completed quiver\n\nWith these tools in hand, we can proceed to find a quiver algebra whose derived category of\nmodules is equivalent to the derived category of the total space KX . This material is from\nBridgeland's paper [5].\nGiven a simple helix Ei generated by an exceptional collection (E0 , . . . , En\u22121 ), we define\nthe following graded algebra:\nM Y\nHom(Ei , Ej ) .\n(2.23)\nk\u22650 j\u2212i=k\n\nwhich Bridgeland calls the helix algebra.10 There is a natural Z-action given by the isomorphism\n\u2297KX : Hom(Ei , Ej ) \u2212\u2192 (Ei\u2212n , Ej\u2212n ) .\n(2.24)\nThe invariant subalgebra under this action is called the rolled-up helix algebra. We will\ndenote its opposite algebra by B 11 .\nNow, similar to the object T in (2.4), we can define on KX :\nTe =\n\nn\u22121\nM\n\n\u03c0 \u2217 Ei\n\n(2.25)\n\ni=0\n\nwhere \u03c0 is the projection from KX to X. Proposition 4.1 of Bridgeland [5] states that the\nfunctor\nHom(Te, *) : D b (KX ) \u2212\u2192 D b (B \u2212 Mod)\n(2.26)\nis an equivalence of triangulated categories.\nA crucial element of the proof of this theorem is that, for any line bundle L over a space\nX with projection \u03c0, we have\nM\n\u03c0\u2217 (OL ) =\nLp\n(2.27)\np\u22640\n\nwhere we also denote by L the sheaf of sections of the line bundle\nQ L.\nThe degree zero part of B contains the idempotents ei = k\u2208Z idEi+nk . Thus, we can\ndefine the projective modules Pi = Bei which are the images of the objects \u03c0 \u2217 Ei . There are\nalso simple modules Ti such that dim(ei Tj ) = \u03b4ij . If we let s be the zero section of KX , then\nthe object s\u2217 (Sj ) = s\u2217 (Fn\u22121\u2212j [j]) is mapped to the Tj .\n10\n\nThis is similar to the helix algebra in [26].\nThis is the opposite of Bridgeland's definition, but is consistent with our earlier definition of A and with\nthe conventions of other papers.\n11\n\n8\n\n\fGiven the equivalence of categories, it is clear by the spectral sequence of the previous section that the quivers derived there are the quivers from this algebra. It would be\ninteresting to use this to prove the conjecture about the superpotential from the previous\nsection.\n\n3.\n\nUndoing the orbifold\n\nNow that we see how to derive the quiver for the total space KX , we would like to interpret it as an orbifold and undo that orbifold. In this section, we will show how to do so\nalgorithmically. We will somewhat justify these manipulations in proceeding sections.\nLet us assume we are on a 2-fold, X, with Fano index I. Let us denote by k the line\nbundle such that k I = KX . The equivalence (2.26) of the previous section follows from the\nfact (2.27) which holds for any line bundle, L, and the fact that the action of tensoring with\nKX preserves the helix. As we would like to describe the total space of the line bundle k,\nwe would like to have a helix that is preserved by tensoring with k. If this were true, it\nwould follow from the arguments in [5] that the invariant portion of the helix algebra under\nthis action would have a derived category of modules equivalent to the derived category of\ncoherent sheaves on the total space of k.\nWe now make the following:\nConjecture 1 Given a Fano K\u00e4hler-Einstein 2-fold, X, with Fano index, I, and k such\nthat k I = KX , there always exists a helix, Ei , of length n, such that Ei = Ei+n/I \u2297 k.\nIn the smooth case, this conjecture is trivial. For P2 , we have K = O(\u22123), I = 3 and\nk = O(\u22121). The helix (O(i)) is invariant under tensoring by O(\u22121). For P1 \u00d7 P1 , we have\nK = O(\u22122, \u22122), I = 2 and k = O(\u22121, \u22121). The helix (2.22) is invariant under tensoring\nwith O(\u22121, \u22121). We should note that in both cases there exist other helices that do not\nrespect this action. For example, on P1 \u00d7P1 , the helix generated by the exceptional collection\n(O, O(0, 1), O(1, 0), O(1, 1)) is not invariant. The quiver obtained from this collection is not,\nthen, an orbifold although it is a perfectly legitimate description of the gauge theory on\nKP1 \u00d7P1 . The two quivers should be related by Seiberg duality.\nWe can provide some evidence for this conjecture in a more general context by the following. Consider an exceptional invertible sheaf (line bundle), A. Then, clearly, Exti (A, A) \u223c\n=\nExti (A \u2297 k a , A \u2297 k a ) = 0 for all a and i 6= 0. In addition, we have Exti (A \u2297 k \u2212a , A) = H i (k a ).\nNow, k a is a negative line bundle, so this vanishes for i < 2 by the Kodaira vanishing theorem.\nFurthermore, we can apply Serre duality and, using the fact that k \u2212a \u2297KX = k I\u2212a is also negative for a < I, we see that this vanishes for i = 2 also. Finally, Exti (A, A \u2297 k \u2212a ) = H i (k \u2212a ).\nSince k \u2212a = k \u2212I\u2212a \u2297 Kx and k \u2212I\u2212a is positive, this Ext group also vanishes for i > 0. From\nthis, we can conclude that (A, A \u2297 k \u22121 , . . . , A \u2297 k \u2212I+1 ) is a strong exceptional collection.\nGiven that the number of elements in a full exceptional collection is equal to the rank\nof the Grothendieck group, this conjecture implies that the Fano index divides this rank.\nAgain, this is trivially true in the smooth case. We hope that something like this holds in\nthe orbifold case.\nNow we can see how to undo the orbifold of the quiver. The action of k on the helix\ngives rise to an action on the quiver. In particular, the nodes of the quiver correspond to\n9\n\n\f.\n\n\u2022Z\n\n{\n\nFigure 5: The undone orbifold quiver for P2 .\n(*\n\n\u2022 jh\n\n\u2022\n\nFigure 6: The undone quiver for P1 \u00d7 P1 .\nthe elements in the exceptional collection. Thus, in the case of P2 , the action is given by\nrotating figure 3 by 120 degrees. For P1 \u00d7 P1 , figure 4 is rotated 180 degrees. By restricting\nto the invariant parts, we find the quivers in figures 5 and 6. We will make this precise in\nsection 6.3.\nFor P2 , the superpotential (2.13) is invariant under the action and thus descends to the\nundone orbifold. As the cone O(\u22121) over P2 is just C3 blown up at the origin, we should\nobtain N = 4 SYM. To see that we do, notice that three lines in the quiver correspond to\nthe three chiral multiplets in N = 4 SYM. The superpotential gives the usual [Xi , Xj ]2 term\nin the action.\nFor P1 \u00d7 P1 , undoing the orbifold identifies a with c and b with d in (2.14). This gives\nus the following superpotential\nW = \u01ebik \u01eblj al bi aj bk .\n\n(3.1)\n\nThe cone O(\u22121, \u22121) over P1 \u00d7 P1 is a resolution of the cone cut out by x2 + y 2 + z 2 + w 2 = 0\nin C4 . This cone, termed the conifold, was first investigated in the context of AdS/CFT in\n[27,28]. The quiver and superpotential obtained here are exactly those derived there.\n\n4.\n\nOrbifolds of C\u2217 bundles\n\nIn this section, we will show how the above procedure can be implemented in terms of\norbifolds. D-branes on an orbifold, Y /G for G some finite group, are described by the\nb\nequivariant derived category, DG\n(Y ), [16]. For simplicity, we will assume G is Abelian.\nThen, this category admits an action by the group G, the quantum symmetry, and if we\nlook at the orbits of the action, we recover the derived category of the original space D b (Y ).\nThis is the essence of the procedure in the previous section.\nThere is a barrier to implementing this proposal, however. Given a line bundle L over\nY , the total space Ln is not a Zn orbifold of L. In this situation, Zn acts on the fibers\nby multiplication by e2i\u03c0/n , but this action preserves the origin. Thus, the quotient space\nis singular in codimension one. Later, we will use the McKay correspondence of [29] to\novercome this difficulty, but before tackling that proposition, let us warm up by simply\nremoving the origin and replacing our line bundles with C\u2217 bundles.\nC\u2217 bundles are particularly relevant for AdS/CFT because the 5-fold, denoted M5 above,\nis the total space of a circle bundle with Euler class, e. This bundle is a deformation retract\nof the total space of the C\u2217 bundle also characterized by the two-form e.\nIn order to postpone the introduction of equivariant derived categories, we will deal\ninstead with equivariant fiber bundles which are ordinary bundles along with a lift of the\norbifold action on the base to the total space of the bundle. For x, gx \u2208 Y and g \u2208 G,\n10\n\n\fthis gives an identification of the points in the fibers Fx and Fgx . If the fiber is a vector\nspace, F , we can take a representation of G, r : r(g) \u2208 GL(F ). With this in hand, we can\nmodify the above identification to Fx \u2192 r(g)Fgx . This gives an action of representations on\nequivariant vector bundles. In the case of line bundles, the one dimensional representations\nform a group under the tensor product that, for G abelian, is the same as G. Choosing such\nan identification gives an action of G on the set of equivariant line bundles. Note that this\nis not an automorphism of the equivariant Picard group.\nLet us assume that G acts freely on Y . Then, the set of equivariant line bundles is\n2\nHG (Y, Z) \u223c\n= H 2 (Y /G, Z). We would like to identify the above action on the second cohomology of Y /G. Let us assume that Y is simply connected. Then, it is a standard fact that\n\u03c01 (Y /G) \u223c\n= G as G is Abelian. The universal coefficient theorem then tells\n= H1 (Y /G, Z) \u223c\n2\nus that Htors\n(Y /G, Z) \u223c\n= G. Thus, we have a G action on H 2 (Y /G, Z) given by addition of\nits torsion elements which we have identified with G. These torsion elements correspond to\ncertain line bundles over Y , and the action is simply the usual tensor product of line bundles.\nNow, let us specialize to the case at hand where Y is the total space of a C\u2217 bundle over\nX. This C\u2217 bundle is characterized by its Euler class e. There is also a corresponding line\nbundle over X, which we denote as E, which has first Chern class e. Let \u03c0 be the projection\nfrom Y to X. Then, the pullback bundle \u03c0 \u2217 E is trivial. This can be see by constructing\na global nonzero section. This implies that \u03c0 \u2217 (e) = 0 in cohomology. In fact, from the the\nGysin sequence and the fact that X is simply connected, we have H 2 (Y, Z) \u223c\n= H 2 (X, Z)/Ze.\nNow, let X have Fano index I and let E \u223c\n= \u03c0 \u2217 (k I ) \u223c\n= \u03c0 \u2217 (KX ). In our usual abuse of notation,\nwe will use the same symbols for line bundles and their first Chern classes. Then we have\nH 2 (Y, Z) \u223c\n= H 2 (X, Z)/\u03c0 \u2217 (KX )Z\n\n(4.1)\n\nand I\u03c0 \u2217 (k) = 0 \u2208 H 2 (Y, Z).\nFor P2 , we have M 5 = S 5 /Z3 and H 2 (S 5 /Z3 , Z) = Z3 . The second cohomology consists\nof the torsion elements {0, \u03c0 \u2217(k), 2\u03c0 \u2217 (k)} with 3\u03c0 \u2217 (k) = 0. These correspond precisely to\nthe line bundles that form the exceptional collection (O(\u22122), O(\u22121), O). The action on the\ncohomology given by adding the form \u03c0 \u2217 (k) gives precisely the action on the nodes of the\nquiver in the previous section. This lifts to an autoequivalence of the derived category given\nby tensoring with O(\u22121).\nFor P1 \u00d7 P1 , we have M 5 = T 11 /Z2 , and H 2 (T 11 /Z2 , Z) = Z \u2295 Z2 . If we denote by a\nand b the generators of H 2 (P1 \u00d7 P1 , Z) = Z \u2295 Z, we have 2\u03c0 \u2217 (a + b) = 0 on T 11 /Z2 . Thus,\nthe action on cohomology is given by the addition of \u03c0 \u2217 (a + b), or tensoring with O(\u22121, \u22121).\nAgain, this gives the previously obtained action on the exceptional collection (2.8).\n\n5.\n\nThe McKay correspondence\n\nWe would now like to be able to extend this discussion to the total space of the line bundle\nKX over X. The goal is to obtain an autoequivalence G of D b (KX ) such that G I = id where\nI is, as usual, the Fano index of X. As stated above, the problem is that the ZI orbifold of\nthe total space of k is not KX . However, as we will see, it is possible to resolve the (conical)\nsingularity of k/ZI to obtain KX . This will allow us, through a theorem of Bridgeland,\nKing and Reid [29], to identify DZb I (k) with D b (KX ). Unfortunately, we have not been able\n11\n\n\fto use this theorem to obtain the proper autoequivalence. In the next section, we will use\nsome further results of Bridgeland [5] to conjecturally identify this autoequivalence which\ncorresponds to the quantum symmetry of the orbifold.\nLet us briefly introduce the equivariant derived category. For further details, see [29].\nLet Y be a space with a G action. An equivariant sheaf on Y is a sheaf, F on Y , along\nwith a set of maps fg : F \u2192 g \u2217F that satisfy fhg = g \u2217 (fh )fg and f1 = id. There is an\naction of G on Hom(F , G) for F and G equivariant sheaves. Restricting to the invariant\npart, we obtain G-Hom(F , G). From this, one can obtain the Abelian category CohG (Y )\nb\nand the usual derived categories including DG\n(Y ). All the usual functors such as G-Ext and\npushforwards and pullbacks for equivariant maps exist and satisfy the usual relations. As\nwith the equivariant line bundles above, there is also an action of a representation of G on\nan equivariant sheaf by tensor product.\nIn order to state the McKay correspondence of [29] we need one final ingredient, the\nHilbert scheme of G-clusters on Y , G-Hilb Y . In general, this is a complicated object which\nwe will not define. Broadly speaking, however, we can look at the space of subschemes (think\nsubmanifolds) of some space, Y . For example, we can look at the space of sets of n points\nin Y where the points are considered indistinguishable. This is, in general, a singular space\nwhen two points come together. The Hilbert scheme is a crepant resolution of the singular\npoints of this space. The Hilbert scheme of G-clusters, then, is a resolution of the space of\nG-clusters which are, in essence, orbits of the G action on Y . Thus, G-Hilb Y is a resolution\nof Y /G.\nWith all this in hand, Bridgeland, King and Reid proved that\nDG (Y ) \u223c\n= D(G-Hilb Y ) .\n\n(5.1)\n\nMore properly, we should replace G-Hilb Y by its irreducible component containing the free\norbits. There are also some further technicalities which we will ignore.\nWe can now specialize to our situation. Let X and I be as before, and let Y = k with\nthe G = ZI action given by rotation on the fibers. We would like to determine G-Hilb Y .\nThe first thing to note is that, as the action of the group preserves the fiber, we can reduce\nthe question to determining G-Hilb C. This can be embedded in HilbI C. However, Hilbert\nschemes of points in dimension one are known to be isomorphic to the symmetric product\nCI /SI which is nonsingular in this case. Elements in this space can be written as sums of\ncomplex numbers, i.e., a + 2b + c \u2208 Hilb4 C. The action of G on C lifts to an action on\nCI /SI , and G-Hilb\nis embedded as the G invariants points. It is not hard to see that these\nP\nare given by Ii=0 gi a for a \u2208 C and gi ranging over all the elements in G. This gives a map\nfrom C to G-Hilb C. Since, off the zero section, the space Y /G is nonsingular and isomorphic\nto the total space KX off the zero section, we see that ZI -Hilb k \u223c\n= KX . Thus, we have the\nhoped for automorphism\n(5.2)\nDZI (k) \u223c\n= D(KX ) .\nThis implies that there should be an action of the group ZI on the triangulated category\nD(KX ), but it appears to be difficult to determine this directly from the work of Bridgeland,\nKing and Reid. In the next section, we will conjecture the correct autoequivalence. As we\ncan embed the C\u2217 bundles of the previous section into the line bundles of this section, we\nexpect that, off the zero section, this should reduce to the autoequivalence discovered there.\n12\n\n\f6.\n\nThe orbifold monodromy\n\n6.1.\n\nSpherical objects and twist functors\n\nIn order to formulate our conjecture about the orbifold monodromy, we must introduce the\nnotions of spherical objects and twist functors due to Seidel and Thomas [22]. Let Z be an\nalgebraic variety of dimension n. An object in S \u2208 D(Z) is called spherical if\n(\nC if k = 0 or n\n(6.1)\nHom(S, S[k]) =\n0 otherwise.\nAn easy source of spherical objects follows from the relation (2.10). This implies that, for\nany exceptional object, E \u2208 D(X), s\u2217 (E) \u2208 D(KX ) is spherical where s is the zero section\nof KX . Given an exceptional collection, we will associate a collection of spherical objects as\nthe pushforwards of the dual collection. Recall that these correspond to the simple modules\nof the completed quivers.\nSeidel and Thomas then define a twist functor TS which is the autoequivalence of the\nderived category which completes the following triangle for all F \u2208 D(Z)\nHom(S, F ) \u2297 S \u2192 F \u2192 TS (F ) .\n\n(6.2)\n\nGiven a collection of spherical objects, one can define an action of the braid group by these\nautoequivalences of the derived category. This is further investigated in [5].\nThe twist functor can be written in terms of a Fourier-Mukai transform12 as follows.\nRecall that for an autoequivalence, the Fourier-Mukai transform is specified by its kernel,\nan element in D(Z \u00d7 Z). Let S \u2208 D(Z) be spherical. Then, the kernel that gives the twist\nfunctor is\nS \u2228 \u22a0 S \u2192 O\u2206Z\n(6.3)\nwhere S \u2228 = RHom(S, OZ ) is the dual object to S in the derived category. Twist functors\ngenerally appear in physics as monodromies around conifold points in the moduli space. For\nmore information, see [16] and references therein.\n6.2.\n\nThe conjectured monodromy\n\nWe will need the following result of Bridgeland, a slight variation of Proposition 4.9 of [5]13 .\nLet (E0 , . . . , En\u22121 ) be a simple collection in D(X), let Ei , i \u2208 Z be the corresponding helix,\nand let (S0 , . . . , Sn\u22121 ) be the corresponding spherical objects. Then, the spherical objects\nfor the simple collection (E\u22121 , E0 , . . . , En\u22122 ) are TSn\u22121 (Sn\u22121 , S0 , . . . , Sn\u22122 ) where the twist\nfunctor acts separately on each element in the set.\nIn fact, Bridgeland's proof is only given for the case dim X = n. However, the proof can\nbe seen to hold in general using the definition of a helix given in section 2.3.\nNow, let us define the autoequivalence,\nG = TSn/I\u22121 . . . TS0 Tenk\u22121\n12\n13\n\nFor an introduction to Fourier-Mukai transforms, see [16,30].\nFor a more careful exposition, please see the original paper.\n\n13\n\n(6.4)\n\n\fwhere we act from right to left and Tenk\u22121 denotes the autoequivalence given by tensoring\nwith the invertible sheaf/line bundle k \u22121 . Notice that, off the zero section, this is precisely the inverse of autoequivalence found for the C\u2217 bundles of section 4. With a little\nwork, it can be seen to follow from Bridgeland's theorem that this autoequivalence gives a\ncyclic shift in the simple objects. In other words, it takes the collection (S0 , . . . , Sn\u22121 ) to\n(Sn/I , . . . , Sn\u22121, S0 , . . . , Sn/I\u22121 ).\nPhysically, we know that these spherical objects correspond to fractional branes, and\norbifold monodromies permute the simple branes. Furthermore, the Ith power of our autoequivalence preserves the simples. This motivates us to\nConjecture 2 The autoequivalence of D(KX ) that corresponds to the action of ZI on DZI (k)\nis given by the functor G in equation (6.4). Furthermore, this corresponds to the monodromy\nabout the orbifold point in the moduli space for KX .\nThe second point needs some elaboration. In fact, in a multiparameter moduli space such\nas that for P1 \u00d7 P1 , the orbifold point is of codimension greater than one, so there is no\nobvious notion of an orbifold monodromy. One can, however, take a curve in the moduli\nspace which intersects with the orbifold point and take the monodromy constrained to that\ncurve. This may be the proper interpretation of the monodromy obtained here.\nNow, let us apply this to our two examples. For P2 , we have\nG = Ts\u2217 (O) TenO(1)\n\n(6.5)\n\nwhere, by O(n), we mean the pullback sheaf \u03c0 \u2217 (OP2 (n)). This is precisely the well-known\norbifold monodromy for C3 /Z3 (see, for example [16]). For P1 \u00d7 P1 , we obtain\nG = Ts\u2217 (O(\u22121,0)) Ts\u2217 (O) TenO(1,1) .\n\n(6.6)\n\nWe show in the appendix that this squares to the identity.\n6.3.\n\nObtaining the quiver\n\nWith the action of the orbifold group in hand, we can finally make rigorous the manipulations\nof section 3. Recall that the quiver can be determined from the Ext groups between its simple\nrepresentations (2.9). We will use our knowledge of the G-Ext groups in the equivariant\nderived category to obtain those in the original derived category, thus determining the undone\nquiver.\nThe needed relationship is Lemma 4.1 of [29] which we quote here. Let E and F be\nG-sheaves on X. Then, as a representation of G, we have a direct sum decomposition\nHomX (E, F ) =\n\nk\nM\n\nG-HomX (E \u2297 \u03c1i , F ) \u2297 \u03c1i\n\n(6.7)\n\ni=0\n\nover the irreducible representations of G, {\u03c10 , . . . , \u03c1k }. It is straightforward to see that this\nholds for Ext groups as well.\n\n14\n\n\fFor us, G is the cyclic group ZI , and the representation ring is generated by a single\nrepresentation. We identify the action of the generating representation with the autoequivalence conjectured above which permutes the simples. This choice is, of course, not unique.\nWe can now decompose the simples into orbits under the permutation and, choosing one\nrepresentative from each orbit, compute the Ext groups using (6.7).\nFor example, for P2 , we have three simple representations Si upon which the group Z3\nacts as Si \u2192 Si+1 mod 3 . There is only one orbit, and we must only compute one set of Ext\ngroups:\nExti (S, S) = G-Exti (S0 , S0 ) \u2295 G-Exti (S0 , S1 ) \u2295 G-Exti (S0 , S2 ) .\n(6.8)\nBy the McKay correspondence, we can identify the equivariant Exts with the Exts of the\nquiver KP2 in figure 3. The three Ext1 s from S0 to S1 give the three arrows in the quiver of\nfigure 5. The three Ext2 s from S0 to S2 and the Ext3 from S0 to S0 give the relations.\nFollowing the same procedure for P1 \u00d7 P1 yields the quiver of figure 6.\n\n7.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nI am greatly indebted to Tom Bridgeland for providing me a copy of [5] and for many e-mail\nconversations.

The calculation uses similar techniques to those in [16], section 7.3.5. Let X = P1 \u00d7 P1 and Y = KX with projection \u03c0\nand zero section s as before. Let O = s\u2217 (OX ) where the latter is the structure sheaf on X.\nFurthermore, let A(n) = A \u2297 \u03c0 \u2217 OX (n) for any sheaf A on Y . Finally, for an object in the\nderived category E, we denote its dual E \u2228 = RHom(E, OY ).\nAs a Fourier-Mukai transform, the autoequivalence (6.6) has the following kernel:\nO\u2228 (0, 1) \u22a0 O(\u22121, 0) \u2212\u2192 O\u2228 (1, 1) \u22a0 O \u2212\u2192 O\u2206 (1, 1)\n\n(A.1)\n\nwhere, in O\u2206 (1, 1), we pull back by the diagonal map.\nSquaring this, we obtain\nO(\u22121, 0)\u2228 \u22a0 O(\u22121, 0) \u2212\u2192 O(0, \u22121)\u2228 \u22a0 O(0, 1) \u2295 O(\u22122, 0)\u2228 \u22a0 O\n\u2212\u2192 O(\u22121, \u22121)\u2228 \u22a0 O(1, 1) \u2212\u2192 O\u2206 (2, 2) . (A.2)\nWe can write this as Cone(A \u2212\u2192 O\u2206 (2, 2)) where A consists of the first three terms in the\nsequence.\n15\n\n\fBecause X is the zero section of the bundle Y , we have the following exact sequence:\n0 \u2212\u2192 OY (2, 2) \u2212\u2192 OY \u2212\u2192 O \u2212\u2192 0 .\n\n(A.3)\n\nFrom this, we can determine that O(a, b)\u2228 = O(\u22122 \u2212 a, \u22122 \u2212 b)[\u22121]. Substituting this into\nA, we obtain\nA[1] = O(\u22121, \u22122) \u22a0 O(\u22121, 0) \u2212\u2192 O(\u22122, \u22121) \u22a0 O(0, 1) \u2295 O(0, \u22122) \u22a0 O\n\u2212\u2192 O(\u22121, \u22121) \u22a0 O(1, 1) (A.4)\nwhich is the pushforward of a sequence on X. If we conjugate with the action of tensor\nproducts with O(1, 1) we obtain\nO(0, \u22121) \u22a0 O(2, 1)\u2228 \u2212\u2192 O(\u22121, 0) \u22a0 O(1, 0)\u2228 \u2295 O(1, \u22121) \u22a0 O(1, 1)\u2228 \u2212\u2192 O \u22a0 O\u2228\n\n(A.5)\n\nwhere we have used that O(a, b)\u2228 = O(\u2212a, \u2212b) on X. Finally, it follows from theorem 4.4.3\nof [25] that this sequence is a resolution of the diagonal. The conjugation by O(1, 1) has no\neffect on the identity, giving A = O\u2206X [\u22121]. Then, using the exact sequence (A.3) we can\nwrite the total action as\nCone ((O\u2206Y (2, 2) \u2212\u2192 O\u2206Y )[\u22121] \u2212\u2192 O\u2206Y (2, 2)) = O\u2206Y\n\n(A.6)\n\nThis proves that the autoequivalence squares to the identity.\n\nReferences\n[1] F.
