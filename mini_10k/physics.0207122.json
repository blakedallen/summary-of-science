Another approach\nwas proposed in [4, 5]. The concept of the position-representation photon\nwave function has a long history and is still controversial. Nevertheless we do\nnot want to discuss the question here. The reader interested in this problem\nis referred to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] and references therein. In this paper the\nconcept serves us as a convenient tool.\nThe starting point for us is the free photon Schr\u00f6dinger equation [1, 2, 3].\nOn this basis we develop the description of photon in medium in terms of\n\u2217\n\ne-mail: jarek@ps.pl\n\n1\n\n\fthe photon wave function. Some attempts of this kind have been presented\nin [1, 2, 3]. What is new in our approach is to show that the influence of the\nmedium on the photon can be described through some potentials. Though\ngenerally the idea is not new, see e.g. [8, 9], but here we realize it within the\nformalism of the photon wave function. This approach can be easily extended\nto the case of many interacting photons. For a large number of photons,\nit results as a nonlinear optics. In particular, taking as a simple model\nthe photons interacting via Dirac delta-potential one obtains (in Hartree\napproximation) the Kerr type nonlinearity of the medium. The problem of\ninteractions of photons via delta-potential and the Kerr nonlinearity of the\nmedium has its vast literature, especially in the context of quantization of\nnonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation ([10, 11] and references therein). But all the\nliterature refers to the procedure of creation-annihilation operators.\nThe paper is organized in the following way. We begin the Section 2 with\nthe brief description of a single photon in the medium. On this basis we\nextend the approach to the case of many interacting photons. We present\nthat in Hartree approximation the many-photon quantum Schr\u00f6dinger equation takes on the form similar to the nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation. The\nobtained equation expressed in terms of classical language is nothing else but\nMaxwell equations with material relations in the form of Kerr type nonlinearity. In Section 3 we summarize results and give some final remarks.\n\n2\n\nResults\n\nIn the papers [1, 2, 3] the following form of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for free\nphoton was proposed\nih\u0304\u2202t F = Hf F ,\n(1)\nF=\n\n\"\n\nE(t, r) + iH(t, r)\nE(t, r) \u2212 iH(t, r)\n\n#\n\n,\n\nHf = c\n\n\"\n\np * S,\n0\n0,\n\u2212p * S\n\n#\n\n,\n\n(2)\n\np = \u2212ih\u0304\u2207 - momentum of photon; (Si )kl = \u2212i\u03b5ikl - spin photon matrix.\nOn the classical language, the equations are equivalent to the following\nMaxwell equations\n\u2202t E = c\u2207 \u00d7 H,\n\n\u2202t H = \u2212c\u2207 \u00d7 E;\n\nD = E,\n\nB = H.\n\n(3)\n\ndescribing free fields in vacuum. Since all the information carried by function\nF is contained in its positive energy (positive frequency) part F (+) , one may\n2\n\n\ftake this part as the true photon wave function [3]\n\u03c8 = F (+) .\n\n(4)\n\nTo become a complete set of Maxwell equations, equation (3) must be supplied by divergence conditions \u2207 * E = 0, \u2207 * H = 0. It is equivalent to the\nrelation p * \u03c8 = 0.\nIn order to describe the propagation of photon in dielectric, one should\ninclude in Hamiltonian the interaction term. On the microscopic level, such\ninteraction is rather complicated, but here we will take it into account in a\nphenomenological way. We assume that the photon treated as a quantum\nobject 'feels' the medium as an external classical field. For a stationary state\nthe wave function takes on the form\n\u03c8\u03c9 = \u03c6\u03c9 (r) exp(\u2212i\u03c9t),\n\nwhere \u03c6\u03c9 (r) =\n\n\"\n\nE(r) + iH(r)\nE(r) \u2212 iH(r)\n\n#\n\n.\n\n(5)\n\nGenerally, the couplings of the medium with the electric and magnetic part\nof the wave function may be different. To take it into account we introduce\ntwo real and symmetric matrices \u03b3 and \u03b7 which split the wave function \u03c8\u03c9\ninto electric and magnetic parts\n\u03b3\u03c8\u03c9 + \u03b7\u03c8\u03c9 = \u03c8\u03c9 ,\nE\nE\n\n#\n\n1 1\n1 1\n\n#\n\n\u03b3\u03c8\u03c9 =\n1\n\u03b3=\n2\n\n\"\n\n\"\n\n,\n\n\u03b7\u03c8\u03c9 =\n\n,\n\n1\n\u03b7=\n2\n\n(6)\n\n\"\n\n\"\n\niH\n\u2212iH\n\n#\n\n1 \u22121\n\u22121 1\n\n,\n\n(7)\n#\n\n.\n\n(8)\n\nThe projection operators \u03b3, \u03b7 fulfill the following relations i.e.: \u03b3 2 = \u03b3, \u03b7 2 =\n\u03b7, \u03b3\u03b7 = 0. When the couplings with the electrical and magnetic parts are\ntaken into account, the Schr\u00f6dinger equation takes on the form\nh\u0304\u03c9\u03c8\u03c9 = Hf \u03c8\u03c9 \u2212 \u03a9\u03c9 (r)\u03b3\u03c8\u03c9 .\n\n(9)\n\n\u03a9\u03c9 (r)\u03b3, \u0393\u03c9 (r)\u03b7 have interpretation of potential energy operators. \u03a9\u03c9 (r) is\nconnected with the dielectric susceptibility \u03c7\u03c9 (r) = \u03a9\u03c9 (r)/h\u0304\u03c9, and \u0393\u03c9 (r)\nwith magnetic susceptibility \u03c7m\n\u03c9 (r) = \u0393\u03c9 (r)/h\u0304\u03c9.\n\n3\n\n\fAnd now consider N interacting photons propagating in a homogeneous\nmedium. Let the Hamiltonian H has the form\nH=\n\nN\nX\nl=1\n\nHl \u2212 N\u03a9\u03c9 \u03b3 \u2212\n\nX\n\nHlj .\n\n(10)\n\nj>l\n\nwhere the first term is the sum of N identical one-particle Hamiltonians in\nthe form given by equation (2) - each describing evolution of a free photon, the second term describes their coupling to the non-magnetic medium\n(\u0393\u03c9 = 0), and the third term is the sum taken over all the photon-photon\ninteractions Hlj . It may be any mechanism leading effectively to the weak\ninteraction between photons. The main assumption is that the interaction\ncan be modeled by Dirac \u03b4-function (when the two photons are simultaneously in a very small volume element V of the space). The measure of its\nintensity is given by a parameter A\u03c9 . Because the photon-photon interaction\nis performed with the help of the medium, and the dielectric medium acts\neffectively only on the electrical component of the wave function, therefore\nthe matrix \u03b3 should appear in the Hamiltonian Hlj :\nHlj = A\u03c9 V \u03b3\u03b4(rl \u2212 rj ).\n\n(11)\n\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation for the N photons takes on the form\nih\u0304\u2202t \u03c8(r1 , . . . , rN , t) = H\u03c8(r1 , . . . , rN , t).\n\n(12)\n\nThe position-representation N-photon wave function \u03c8(r1 , . . . , rN , t) is constructed in a similar way as the one constructed previously for one photon\n\u03c8=\n\n\"\n\n#\n\nE(t, r1, . . . , rN ) + iH(t, r1 , . . . , rN )\nE(t, r1 , . . . , rN ) \u2212 iH(t, r1 , . . . , rN )\n\n= \u03c6\u03c9 (r1 , . . . , rN ) exp(\u2212i\u03c9t).\n\n(13)\nThe last equality means that only stationary states are considered.

To this end one may recast equation\n(18) to ordinary form of Maxwell equations\n\u03c9 \u2217\n[\u03b5 + \u03b1\u03c9 (N \u2212 1)(e2 + h2 )]e = i\u2207 \u00d7 h,\nc \u03c9\n5\n\n\u03c9\nh = \u2212i\u2207 \u00d7 e,\nc\n\n(20)\n\n\f2A\u03c9 V s2\n\u03a9\u2217\u03c9\n,\n\u03b1\u03c9 =\n.\nh\u0304\u03c9\nh\u0304\u03c9\nThe quantities e and h require some renormalization\n\u221a\n\u221a\nEkl = N \u2212 1 e,\nHkl = N \u2212 1 h.\nwhere \u03b5\u2217\u03c9 = 1 +\n\n(21)\n\nThus the equation (20) takes on the form\n\u03c9\n[\u03b5\u03c9 + \u03b1\u03c9 (E2kl + H2kl )]Ekl = i\u2207 \u00d7 Hkl ,\nc\n\n\u03c9\nHkl = \u2212i\u2207 \u00d7 Ekl ,\nc\n\n(22)\n\nNote that in this equation \u03b5\u2217\u03c9 is replaced by the quantity \u03b5\u03c9 defined as\n\u03b5\u03c9 = 1 +\n\n\u03a9\u03c9\n.\nh\u0304\u03c9\n\n(23)\n\nIt is due to the fact that in definition (19) of \u03a9\u2217\u03c9 in the second term the\nfactor N \u2212 1 appears and fields in integral are in fourth power. Therefore\nafter the renormalization (21) the fields in the integral are divided by N \u2212 1.\nThe procedure of the mean field approximation (Hartree) is correct only for\nlarge N. It means that the second term in (19) can be omitted and one thus\nobtains\n\u03a9\u2217\u03c9 = \u03a9\u03c9 ,\nand\n\u03b5\u2217\u03c9 = \u03b5\u03c9 .\n(24)\nFor electromagnetic field (in medium as well as in vacuum) one may write\nE2kl \u221d H2kl .\nTherefore\n\n\u03c9\n\u03c9\n\u03b5N L Ekl = i\u2207 \u00d7 Hkl ,\nHkl = \u2212i\u2207 \u00d7 Ekl ,\nc\nc\nwhere\n\u03b5N L = \u03b5\u03c9 + r\u03c9 \u03b1\u03c9 E2kl .\n\n(25)\n(26)\n(27)\n\nr\u03c9 is a factor refering to the relation (25).\nThe interaction between photons results as the Kerr type nonlinearity of\nthe medium (27). Such type of nonlinearity is required to obtain (in paraxial and slowly varying envelop approximation) soliton solutions of Maxwell\nequations [13]. In the view of the above results the soliton can be treated as\na bound state (cluster) of many photons. This is the attracting interaction\nbetween photons, which can counteract spreading (because of dispersion or\ndiffraction) of the wave packet.\n6\n\n\f3\n\nSummary\n\nThe influence of the medium on photon can be described by some scalar\npotentials. This approach can be easily extended to the case of many interacting photons. Taking the simplest model of such interaction (via deltapotential) in Hartree approximation one obtains Kerr type nonlinearity of\nthe medium. One may say that optically nonlinear material it is the material that enables interaction between photons. This result suggests that\noptical solitons are nothing else but clusters of interacting photons. In such\na cluster the attraction between photons counteracts dispersion or diffraction. This is a similar point of view to that presented in [14] where solitons\nof magnetization in magnetics were described as clusters of interacting (via\ndelta-potential) magnons.\n\nReferences\n[1] I.
