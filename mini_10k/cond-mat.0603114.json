For example, coexistence of multiple species in ecological habitats\nimplies stable biodiversity realized in nature [1, 2]. Coexistence of multiple types of players\nin evolutionary games implies survival of altruistic players in the sea of selfish players [3].\nCoexistence of disease-free and infected individuals implies an endemic state that should be\nsuppressed usually [4].\nMechanisms of coexistence have been a central theoretical question because complexity of\na population state (i.e. coexistence) and stability are often contradicting requirements [5, 6,\n7]. Coexistence in population dynamics has been explained by, for example, nonequilibriumstate interpretation, habitat subdivision, heterogeneity in species such as heterogeneous\ndispersal speeds, and heterogeneity in environments [1, 2, 6, 8]. Spatial structure such\nas the square lattice also limits diffusion and promotes coexistence. In this case, each\nspecies is clustered in different regions of the lattice [9, 10, 11, 12]. However, real-world\ninteraction quite often occurs on contact networks of individuals that are more complex\nthan the square lattice. Most real networks have the small-world and scale-free properties\n(e.g. Refs. [13, 14]). The small-world property is equivalent to the combination of small\naverage distance between vertices and large clustering, or abundance of densely connected\nsmall subgraphs such as triangles. A scale-free network is defined by a degree distribution,\nor the distribution of the number of contacts (edges) that each vertex has, which follows\na power law, pk \u221d k \u2212\u03b3 . Here pk is the probability that a vertex has degree k. The scalefree property may be too idealistic to describe contact networks underlying real population\ndynamics. Even so, it seems likely that different patches or individuals are endowed with\ndifferent connectivity to others.\nIn terms of networks, some known mechanisms of coexistence benefit from the regular\nlattices, the one-dimensional continuous line, the two-dimensional continuous plane, and the\ncomplete graph (mean field situation), in which all the vertices are considered to share the\nsame degree (see the papers cited above and references therein). In random graphs, which\nare sometimes used in this context [5], the vertex degree obeys the Poisson distribution.\nHowever, the real degree distribution may be even broader.\nHere we investigate how possibility of coexistence is affected by heterogeneous degree\n2\n\n\fdistributions of contact networks, not by heterogeneous environments other than networkbased ones or heterogeneous individuals. Among various competitive relationships among\ndifferent phenotypes, we focus on cyclic competition of three species, which is a minimal\ncase.\nCyclic competition is actually abundant in nature. For example, tropical marine ecosystems [15] and vertebrate communities in high-arctic areas [16] include cyclic dominance\nrelations composed of a couple of organisms (also see Ref. [7]). Real microbial communities\nof Escherichia coli [17] and color polymorphisms of natural lizards [18] also have cyclically\ndominating three phenotypes and show alternating wax-and-wane population densities. In\nevolutionary games, the public-good game with volunteering, namely, the choice of not\njoining the game, results in cyclic competition [19]. The susceptible-infected-recoveredsusceptible model of epidemiology and models with additional types of states also include\ncyclic competition [4, 20]. We focus on two specific predator-prey models of such cyclic\ninteraction, that is, the standard rock-scissors-paper (RSP) model [7] and the May-Leonard\n(ML) model [21]. These models have neutrally stable or unstable coexistence solutions in\nwell-mixed populations. Therefore, in a finite population, population dynamics are eventually trapped by an absorbing state corresponding to the dominance of one species [7, 22].\nWe show that heterogeneous degree distributions stabilize coexistence of multiple types of\nindividuals placed on networks.\n\nII.\n\nROCK-SCISSORS-PAPER DYNAMICS ON NETWORKS\nA.\n\nModel\n\nAs a minimal model of cyclic competition, we consider the standard RSP dynamics on\nnetworks with heterogeneous contact rates. There are three species, which we call states,\nrepresented by rock, scissors, and paper; rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper\nbeats rock. Each vertex takes state 0, 1, or 2. A pair of vertices may be connected by an\nedge. The degree k of a vertex is the number of edges, or the number of contacts with other\nvertices. State 1 outcompetes state 0 by invading onto each neighboring state with state 0\nat a rate of \u03bb. In other words, a vertex with state 0 changes its state to 1 at a rate of \u03bbn1 ,\nwhere ni is the number of vertices with state i in the neighborhood. Similarly, 1 (2) turns\n\n3\n\n\finto 2 (0) at a rate of \u03bcn2 (n0 ). In an ecological context, we are considering the limit that\ndispersion rates (= 1, \u03bb, \u03bc) are much larger than the natural death rate. We consider the\ninfluence of death rates later with the ML model.\nFor a perfectly mixed population, the mean field theory tells that there are an ensemble\nof neutrally stable limit cycles surrounding a neutrally stable equilibrium corresponding to\ncoexistence of the three states. Therefore, the coexistence solution is practically unstable\nin finite populations. The RSP dynamics with spatial structure, such as the square lattice,\naccommodate many states each of which is clustered in different loci [10, 11, 12]. Here we\nare interested in a network mechanism that may enable stable coexistence.\n\nB.\n\nEquilibrium\n\nWith dispersed degrees, vertices with different degrees obey different state-transition\ndynamics. Let us denote by \u03c1i,k the probability that a vertex with degree k takes state i\n(= 0, 1, 2). The probability that a vertex adjacent to an arbitrary vertex takes state i is\ndenoted by \u0398i . This probability does not generally agree with \u03c1i,k or its average over all the\nvertices. This is because a vertex with more edges is more likely to be selected as a neighbor.\nIn fact, a neighbor has degree k with probability kpk / hki, where pk is the probability that\nP\na vertex has degree k and hki = kpk is the mean degree giving normalization. Therefore,\nP\n\u0398i =\nk kpk \u03c1i,k / hki [23]. Because each vertex is occupied by one of the three species,\nnamely, \u03c10,k = 1 \u2212 \u03c11,k \u2212 \u03c12,k and \u03980 = 1 \u2212 \u03981 \u2212 \u03982 , it suffices to consider the density of\n\nstate 1 and that of state 2. Noting that the expected number of state-i neighbors of a vertex\nwith degree k is equal to k\u0398i , we derive\n\u03c1\u03071,k = \u03bb(1 \u2212 \u03c11,k \u2212 \u03c12,k )k\u03981 \u2212 \u03bc\u03c11,k k\u03982 ,\n\n(1)\n\n\u03c1\u03072,k = \u03bc\u03c11,k k\u03982 \u2212 \u03c12,k k(1 \u2212 \u03981 \u2212 \u03982 ).\n\n(2)\n\nFor example, the first term in Eq. (1) corresponds to the invasion of state 1 onto vertices\nwith state 0.

The degree distribution does not affect the equilibrium population densities [20].\n\nC.\n\nStability of coexistence equilibrium\n\nWhen pk = \u03b4k,hki , each vertex has the same degree equal to the mean hki. This case\ncorresponds to well-mixed populations. Then the coexistence is neutrally stable (e.g. Refs.\n[11, 21]), which underlies experimental and natural ecosystems showing oscillatory population dynamics [16, 17, 18]. Equation (2) indicates that the oscillation period is proportional\nto 1/ hki.\nHowever, the stability of the coexistence and realized dynamics are considerably influenced by networks. To see this, let us consider a two-point degree distribution given by\npk = p\u03b4k,k1 + (1 \u2212 p)\u03b4k,k2 . On average, a total of np vertices have degree k1 and n(1 \u2212 p)\nvertices have degree k2 . Equations (1) and (2) for a network with the two-point degree\ndistribution define a four-dimensional dynamical system. We set \u03bb = \u03bc = 1 for simplicity,\nalthough generalization to other \u03bb and \u03bc is straightforward. The characteristic equation\nevaluated at the coexistence equilibrium [Eq. (4)] is represented by\n!\n2 2\nhk 2 i\nhk\ni\nk\nk\n(k\n+\nk\n\u2212\nhki)\n3k\nk\n1 2\n1\n2\n1 2 3\n2\nx\n+\n9\nx +3\n+\nk1 k2 x + 9k12 k22 = 0, (5)\nx4 +\n2\nhki\nhki\nhki\nhki\nP\nP 2\nwhere hki = kpk = pk1 +(1\u2212p)k2 and hk 2 i =\nk pk = pk12 +(1\u2212p)k22 . When k1 = k2 = k,\n\u221a\nwe turn back to the ordinary mean field case with neutrally stable oscillations: x = 3ki,\n\u221a\n(\u22123 \u00b1 3)k/2. More generally, the Routh-Hurwitz criteria for Eq. (5) is\n|H1 | = 1,\n|H2 | = pk22 (hki \u2212 k1 /2)2 + (1 \u2212 p)k12 (hki \u2212 k2 /2)2 + 3k12 k22 /4 > 0,\n\u0010\n\u0011\u000e\n2\n|H3 | = 81k12 k22 p(1 \u2212 p)(k2 \u2212 k1 )2 k 2 + 2k1 k2 hki2\nhki4 ,\n|H4 | = 9k12 k22 |H3 |,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere |Hi | is the ith principal minor. The coexistence solution is stable when |H3 |, |H4 | > 0,\nthat is, k1 6= k2 and p 6= 0, 1. Dispersed contact rates stabilize coexistence.\n5\n\n\fD.\n\nNumerical results\n\nWe resort to numerical simulations to examine more general networks and to be more\nquantitative about the effects of degree dispersion. We compare different types of networks\nwith n = 5000 vertices and hki = 10. The regular (R) random graph corresponding to the\nordinary mean field case is generated by the configuration model [14] with pk = \u03b4k,hki . This is\na type of random graph in which every vertex has the same degree hki. We also use the Erd\u00f6s-\n\nR\u00e9nyi (ER) random graph, which has the Poisson degree distribution pk = e\u2212hki hkik /k!,\nand the Barab\u00e1si-Albert (BA) scale-free network with the parameter m \u223c\n= hki /2 = 5, which\nyields pk \u221d k \u22123 (k \u2265 m) and pk = 0 (k < m) [13].\n\nTypical population dynamics for these networks are shown in Figs. 1(a)\u20131(c). On the\nR random graph, the coexistence solution is neutrally stable in theory. Combined with a\nfinite-size effect, the amplitude of the dynamical population density becomes progressively\nlarge in an oscillatory fashion. Eventually, one state dominates the whole network in an\nearly stage [Fig. 1(a)]. On the ER random graph [Fig. 1(b)] and the BA model [Fig. 1(c)],\ncoexistence occurs owing to the distributed k. The fluctuations in the population density\nis smaller on the BA model than on the ER graph, because the BA model has a broader\ndegree distribution.\nTo be more systematic, we compare population density fluctuation in the coexistence\nequilibrium. The fluctuation is measured by the standard deviation of the time series \u03c1i\n[see Fig. 1(b) and 1(c)] after transient, averaged over i = 0, 1, and 2. Larger fluctuation\nmeans more unstable coexistence, and we examine how the size of the fluctuation depends\non the amount of degree dispersion. In addition to the networks examined above, we use\ntwo types of networks that can create a range of degree dispersion. The first is the network\nq\nwith the two-point degree distribution. The standard deviation of the degree hk 2 i \u2212 hki2 =\np\np(1 \u2212 p)|k1 \u2212 k2 |. By varying k1 /k2 with p = 0.9 and hki = 10 fixed, we can systematically\nq\ncreate networks with a variety of hk 2 i \u2212 hki2 . The second is the network that has Gaussian\np\npk with mean hki, whose hk 2 i \u2212 hki can be also modulated. The results are summarized\nin Fig. 1(d) for four types of networks (ER, BA, two-point, and Gaussian), excluding the\nR random graph because it does not sustain coexistence. Regardless of the network type,\nmore dispersed degree distributions generally lead to more stable coexistence.\nIn the mean field case, a smaller network with a stronger finite-size effect tends to drive\n6\n\n\fthe population dynamics to the absorbing equilibrium where only one state survives [22].\nThe network effect on stability of coexistence is more manifested in this regime. In Fig. 2,\nwe show survival probabilities for some networks with n = 200, where the survival is defined\nby existence of all the three states. Figure 2 is consistent with Fig. 1(d); coexistence is\nsustained for a longer period on networks with larger degree dispersion.\n\nIII.\nA.\n\nMAY-LEONARD DYNAMICS ON NETWORKS\nModel and equilibrium\n\nSince neutrally stable oscillations of the RSP model may be singular phenomena, we\nanalyze another competition model proposed by May and Leonard [21]. The ML model\nrepresents dynamics of cyclically competing three species with natural death. Because of\nthe natural death, vertices can take the vacant state. In a well-mixed population, the\ncoexistence equilibrium and the periodic oscillation are both unstable. A trajectory of the\npopulation density approaches heteroclinic orbits on which at least one of the three species\nis extinct. Theoretically, one species is transiently and alternatively dominant with ever\nincreasing periods in an infinite population. Practically, one species eventually wins due to\nthe finite-size effect.\nAs an interacting particle system, the ML model is a four-state system, with state 0\nrepresenting the vacant site and 1, 2, and 3 representing cyclically dominating states [12].\nThe ML dynamics with heterogeneous contact rates are written as\n\u03c1\u03071,k = \u03c10,k k\u03981 \u2212 (\u03b1 \u2212 1)\u03c12,k k\u03981 \u2212 (\u03b2 \u2212 1)\u03c11,k k\u03983 ,\n\u03c1\u03072,k = \u03c10,k k\u03982 \u2212 (\u03b1 \u2212 1)\u03c13,k k\u03982 \u2212 (\u03b2 \u2212 1)\u03c12,k k\u03981 ,\n\n(7)\n\n\u03c1\u03073,k = \u03c10,k k\u03983 \u2212 (\u03b1 \u2212 1)\u03c11,k k\u03983 \u2212 (\u03b2 \u2212 1)\u03c13,k k\u03982 ,\nwhere \u03c10,k = 1 \u2212 \u03c11,k \u2212 \u03c12,k \u2212 \u03c13,k . The first term in each equation indicates the rate at which\na vacant site becomes colonized by state i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 3). Supposing that \u03b1 < 1 and \u03b2 > 1,\nthe second term and the third term of each equation represent the population increase and\ndecrease due to the cyclic competition, respectively. For example, in the first equation, state\n1 outcompetes 2, whereas 1 is outcompeted by 3. Equation (7) has a coexistence equilibrium\n\n7\n\n\fgiven by\n\u03c1\u2217i,k = \u0398\u2217i = (\u03b1 + \u03b2 + 1)\u22121\n\n(i = 1, 2, 3)\n\n(8)\n\nfor all k. With pk = \u03b4k,hki , the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix evaluated at (\u03c1\u22171,k , \u03c1\u22172,k ,\n\u221a\n\u03c1\u22173,k ), disregarding a prefactor (\u03b1+\u03b2+1)\u22121 , are x = \u2212(1+\u03b1+\u03b2), \u22121+(\u03b1+\u03b2)/2\u00b1 3(\u03b1\u2212\u03b2)i/2\n[21]. When \u03b1 + \u03b2 = 2, the ML model is essentially the same as the RSP model, and the\n\u221a\ncoexistence is neutrally stable [x = \u22123, \u00b1 3(\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2)i/2]. When \u03b1 + \u03b2 > 2 and \u03b1 < 1 (or\n\u03b2 < 1), the coexistence equilibrium is an unstable spiral, and the trajectory tends to a\nhomoclinic orbit.\n\nB.\n\nStability of coexistence equilibrium\n\nTo investigate the network effect, we again consider the two-point degree distribution\npk = p\u03b4k,k1 + (1 \u2212 p)\u03b4k,k2 . The Jacobian matrix at (\u03c1\u22171,k1 , \u03c1\u22171,k2 , \u03c1\u22172,k1 , \u03c1\u22172,k2 , \u03c1\u22173,k1 , \u03c1\u22173,k2 )t , where t\ndenotes the transpose, is a block circulant matrix. Accordingly, the eigenmode has the form\n(v1 , v2 , \u03c1v1 , \u03c1v2 , \u03c12 v1 , \u03c12 v2 )t , v1 , v2 \u2208 C, where \u03c1 is any solution to \u03c13 = 1. The corresponding\ncharacteristic equation is reduced to\n\u0013\n\u0012\nhk 2 i\n2\n2\n2\nx\nx + (\u03b2 + \u03c1\u03b1 + \u03c1 )(k1 + k2 ) \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03c1 )(\u03b2 \u2212 1)\nhki\n+ (\u03b12 + \u03b2 2 \u2212 \u03b1\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2 + 1)\u03c12 k1 k2 = 0.\n\n(9)\n\nFor \u03c1 = 1, Eq. (9) is a real equation, and two eigenvalues have the same real part that is\nequal to \u2212(\u03b1 + \u03b2 + 1)(k1 + k2 )/2 < 0. Because an eigenvalue of Eq. (9) for \u03c1 = exp(2\u03c0i/3) is\nconjugate of one for \u03c1 = exp(4\u03c0i/3), it suffices to set \u03c1 = exp(2\u03c0i/3). The larger real part of\nthe solution to Eq. (9) is plotted in Fig. 3 for various p and 0 < k1 /k2 \u2264 1. The coexistence\nequilibrium is stabilized with negative real parts of the eigenvalues. This occurs when\nk1 /k2 \u223c\n= 0.1 and p = 0.9, 0.95. In this situation, a small number [= n(1 \u2212 p)] of hubs have a\nlarge degree (= k2 ) in comparison with most vertices with degree k1 . This is reminiscent of\nlong-tail pk typical of the scale-free networks. Excess heterogeneity (k1 /k2 < 0.05) destroys\ncoexistence. In this situation, a majority of vertices with degree k1 are effectively isolated,\nand the network is close to the mean field case, or the R random graph with k = k2 .\nWhen p < 0.5, the heterogeneity does not cause stability irrespective of k1 /k2 . This is\nbecause the contribution of the smaller subpopulation (proportion p) with the smaller degree\n\n8\n\n\fk = k1 (< k2 ) to dynamics is marginal, which again results in effectively homogeneous\nnetworks with k = k2 .\n\nC.\n\nNumerical results\n\nFor numerical simulations, we note that, in Eq. (7), a vacant site (state 0) is replaced\nby state i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 3) at a rate of ni . A vertex in state 1 (2, 3) kills a neighboring state 2\n(3, 1) at a rate of \u03b2 \u2212 1. Then, the neighboring vertex is colonized by state 1 (2, 3) with\nprobability (1 \u2212 \u03b1)/(\u03b2 \u2212 1) and turns empty (state 0) otherwise [12].\nDynamics for the R and ER random graphs with n = 5000 and hki = 10 are shown\nin Figs. 4(a) and 4(b), respectively. Because the stability condition for the ML model is\nmore severe than that for the RSP model, one state shortly overwhelms the others on the\nER as well as R random graph. However, the transients for the ER random graph, whose\ndegrees are more dispersed than the R random graph, are longer. The BA model and\nthe networks with two-point pk with parameters realizing the stable Jacobian matrix (but\nnot the networks with Gaussian pk ) yield coexistence. Similar to the RSP dynamics, the\namount of degree dispersion is strongly correlated with the amount of density fluctuation\nand stability of coexistence, irrespective of the network type [Fig. 4(c)].\n\nIV.\nA.\n\nDISCUSSION\nSummary of the results\n\nWe have examined population dynamics with cyclic dominance relationships on networks.\nThe steady population density is independent of degree distributions of networks. However,\nstability of coexistence equilibria and dynamics depend considerably on networks. Heterogeneity in degree distributions facilitates stable coexistence of different phenotypes. As\ntouched upon in Sec. I, coexistence of competing species is desirable in, for example, ecological communities (biodiversity) and evolutionary games (survival of altruistic players).\n\n9\n\n\fB.\n\nRelations to synchronization of coupled oscillators\n\nThe present mechanism of coexistence is related to synchronization of coupled oscillators.\nWith spread degree distributions, each \u03c1i,k evolves at a speed proportional to k, and \u03c1i,1 ,\n\u03c1i,2 , . . . are coupled by a sort of mean field feedback \u0398i . Then, the population dynamics are\nanalogous to those of an ensemble of phase oscillators coupled by mean field interaction. In\ntheory, coupled phase oscillators become desynchronized when the intrinsic frequency of the\noscillators has a broad distribution relative to the coupling strength [24]. Oscillators with\nheterogeneous intrinsic frequencies correspond to vertices with heterogeneous k. In terms of\ncompetition dynamics on networks, asynchrony corresponds to stable coexistence of species\nwhere synchronous oscillations (large fluctuations in time) of the population density is suppressed. Desynchronization is known to suppress neutrally stable or unstable oscillations in\necological models with patchy populations, heterogeneous birth rates, and weak aggregation\n[8]. Heterogeneity in degree distributions serves to stable coexistence via desynchronization\neven without other kinds of heterogeneity. The correspondence between asynchrony and\ncoexistence may be exported to more general models, particularly to ones showing oscillations in well-mixed populations; oscillatory population densities are reminiscent of cyclic\ncompetition.\n\nC.\n\nDifference from spatial mechanisms of coexistence\n\nThe scenario to coexistence unraveled here is distinct from those based on spatial structure, heterogeneous environments, or heterogeneous individuals. In patchy habitats with\nheterogeneous environments or small diffusion [6], and in spatial structure with limited\ndiffusion [9, 10, 11, 12], multiple species can coexist by forming locally high densities of\nconspecifics in different subspaces [10, 11, 12]. This is the spatial mechanism of coexistence.\nIn networks with dispersed degrees, multiple species can coexist on a network in a mixed\nmanner without spatial segregation.\nReal networks of contacts are equipped with the clustering property, as is the case for the\nregular lattices and small-world networks, and high clustering elicits the spatial mechanism\nof coexistence. In addition, many networks own broad degree distributions represented by\nthe scale-free distributions [13, 14, 23]. The mechanism proposed in this work can cooperate\n\n10\n\n\fwith the spatial mechanism to promote stability of coexistence.\n\nD.\n\nDifference from contagion dynamics\n\nThere are many possible rules for interacting particle systems. In contagion processes,\nsuch as the percolation, the susceptible-infected-recovered model, and the contact process\n(susceptible-infected-susceptible model), degree dispersion affects dynamical aspects by, for\nexample, accelerating disease propagation in initial stages [25]. More fundamentally, however, epidemic thresholds (critical infection rates) are proportional to hki / hk 2 i. Then,\ndisease propagation on a global scale is more likely to occur on networks with more heterogeneous contact rates with small hki / hk 2 i than on networks with rather homogeneous\ndegrees such as the regular lattices and the random graph [4, 23]. In contagion dynamics,\nthe network influences the stationary state in addition to the dynamics, which contrasts to\nour results for the competition dynamics.\nGenerally speaking, the positions of equilibria move when we cannot neglect at least one\ntype of state-transition event whose occurrence rate is independent of neighbors' states ni\n[20]. Examples are spontaneous recovery and mutation. By contrast, the equilibria are\ninvariant if all the state transitions are controlled by the neighbors' states, as is the case for\nthe RSP model, the ML model, and also the voter model. However, the degree distribution\ndoes influence the stability of coexistence and hence the whole population dynamics. Our\nresults are generalized to other population dynamics in which the rates of spontaneous\ntransitions can be ignored.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors thank Michio Kondoh for valuable comments.
