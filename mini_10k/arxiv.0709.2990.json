The wealth of new data coming from galaxy\nspectroscopic surveys and from observations with integral field units of nearby\ngalaxies allow for a detailed inventory of the chemical composition of star forming galaxies. Abundance determinations in HII regions are relatively straightforward to calculate if the electron temperature, Te , can be measured directly\nfrom the observations. However, in many cases, the Te diagnostic lines are too\nfaint to be detected due to the strong cooling effect of metals in these regions.\nFaced with this obstacle, Pagel et al. (1979) and Alloin et al. (1979) pioneered\nmethods based on the O23 parameter that allow one to estimate the metallicity\nZ 1 using strong lines only.\n1\n\nThroughout the paper \"metallicity\" is used with the meaning of \"oxygen abundance\"\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nM. Taylor and A. I. Diaz\n\nThe strong line methods assume that all HII regions are essentially characterised\nby their metallicity. However, the metallicity Z and other empirical parameters\nsuch as the hardness of the ionising radiation (which can be inferred from the\nspectral energy distribution and parameterised through the effective or equivalent temperature T \u2217) and the ionisation parameter U are nonlinearly inter-linked\n(V\u0131\u0301lchez & Pagel (1988) and D\u0131\u0301az et al. (1991)) but the exact nonlinear relation\nbetween Z, U and T \u2217 is still unknown. Observed line ratio diagnostics are central\nto the whole endeavour, hence the large amount of literature devoted to the identification of abundance indicators and their calibration (P\u00e9rez-Montero & D\u0131\u0301az\n(2005) and Stas\u0131\u0301nska (2004)). In fact, these are two separate and important issues - the choice of indicator, and the proper abundance calibration. Although a\nplethora of different indicators have been proposed, such as O23 , O3 N2 , N2 , S23 ,\nAr3 O3 and S3 O3 , their full calibration over the total range of metallicity has\nnot yet been possible with confidence due to a lack of data and understanding\nof the physics in metal-rich HII regions (Bresolin (2006) and Pilyugin (2006)).\nTemperature fluctuations are known to play an important role (Peimbert (1967)\nand Peimbert et al. (2006)) and the differences between abundances calculated\nusing optical recombination and collisionally-excited lines (that can vary by up\nto a factor of 70 (Liu et al. (2006)) appear to be related to atomic physics in\nthe infrared. With this in mind we have developed a new artificial intelligence\ntechnique to find, from the optical emission lines, the best indicators so that the\nmethod can be applied with confidence to forthcoming infrared emission line\ndata.\nHere, we present our results for a study of HII-like regions using the S23 diagnostic to illustrate the basic principles. We have selected S23 from the most\ncommonly-used indicators as it has low dispersion and is quasi-linear up to and\nslightly above solar metallicity (see table 4 in P\u00e9rez-Montero & D\u0131\u0301az (2005)). Of\ncourse, at high metallicities it is expected to turn over, following a parabolic and\ndouble-branched curve as for O23 due to effective cooling from S ions. Our approach to the problem uses a genetic network to seek out the empirical relation\nbetween metallicity and S23 .\n2.\n\nSAGAN\n\nThe Scale-invariant And Genetically-Adapted neural Network (SAGAN) has\nbeen developed to deduce empirical laws from observational data (Taylor et al.\n(2006)). It uses a simple backpropagation error rule and is capable of correctly identifying an equation for the functional relationship f between the\nindependent variable xn and the dependent physical variables (x1 , x2 , * * * , xn\u22121 )\nassociated with training data. Contrary to the common practice of subjectively\nchoosing from a library of fitting functions, the network, objectively and unambiguously finds the function that best fits both the training and evaluation\ndata, and hence has great generalisation potential. Even when fed with multidimensional data having mesurement errors of 10%, the network successfully\nidentifies exact equations (Taylor et al. (2006)). Key to its success is a genetic\nalgorithm that evolves the network DNA encoded in the distribution of neuron\nweights, connectivity and transfer functions. The neuron transfer functions undergo selection from a list of 10 mathematical functionals and are what provide\n\n\f3\n\nOn the deduction of galaxy abundances with evolutionary neural networks\nsemantic structure to the network solutions found.\nAnother feature central to the success of SAGAN, is that it is a dimensionless\nnetwork; meaning that it benefits from the dimensionality reduction associated\nwith applying the \u03c0-theorem (Buckingham (1914)) to the data (Taylor & D\u0131\u0301az\n(2006)). In addition to producing a network that is topologically simpler, the degeneracy inherent in the dimensionless groups \u03c0j facilitates learning and leads to\nan error reduction of several orders of magnitude (Taylor et al. (2006)). Metallicity and line ratios are, by definition, dimensionless quantities; nevertheless\nSAGAN exploits the degeneracy associated with combinations of dimensionless\ngroups of variables to expand its search space automatically. SAGAN operates\nas a supervised neural network. The metallicity Z is calculated independently\nusing the auroral line method (incorporating Te and ionisation correction factor\neffects) and provides the supervising component. SAGAN then cycles through a\ngenetic algorithm, evolving its network DNA. In each generation, a population\n(p) of 200 \"parent\" network solutions is generated using the standard genetic\noperators of mutation, replacement and cross-over. Those parents providing the\nbest fit to the data are kept, replicated and bred through cross-over to generate\nthe basis for mutating the next generation. The best individuals in each generation are retained so that they are not lost from the gene pool. The process\ncontinues until the network error E,\nE=\n\n1X\n[f (x1 , * * * , (xn\u22121 ) \u2212 (xn )p ]2\np p\n\n(1)\n\nconverges to a minimum value or until the maximum number of generations\nspecified is reached. The correct empirical law is found when the encoded network DNA has evolved to the point that it is capable of decoding the causal\nrelation existing between input and output observables. In the case of the relation between Z and S23 , the network error is equal to the dispersion in dex. The\nminimum error solution is then converted into an empirical equation by reading\nfrom right to left and summing nodes.\n3.\n\nResults\n\nWe collected optical emission line data for 121 HII-type photoionisation regions that included the sample of 108 HIIGs, GHIIRs and EGHIIRs studied\nby D\u0131\u0301az & P\u00e9rez-Monetro (2000) plus an additional 8 HIIGs from H\u00e4gele et al.\n(2006) and 5 metal-rich GHIIRs taken from Bresolin et al. (2004). Of the 121\nobjects, we selected 96 for which both de-reddened nebular and auroral lines of\nS, O and N in the optical existed, along with an accurate measurement of the\nmetallicity Z complete with measurement errors. The value of the S23 parameter\n(D\u0131\u0301az & P\u00e9rez-Monetro (2000)),\nS23 =\n\n[SII ]\u03bb\u03bb6717, 6731 + [SIII ]\u03bb\u03bb9069, 9532\nH\u03b2\n\n(2)\n\nfor each object, along with its metallicity, provided the training data set for\nSAGAN. In order to create a validation data set, we generated a further 96 points\nwithin the error bars of the training data using a random number generator\n\n\f4\n\nM. Taylor and A. I. Diaz\n\nbased on the normal distribution. During the evolution process, SAGAN outputs\nthe network solution for those generations during which there is a drop in the\ndispersion (network error). Figure 1 shows the network solutions associated\nwith the largest error drops. Although some 1352 generations taking 2 days of\nruntime on a dual 3Ghz PC were required, SAGAN achieved a final linear fit\nhaving a dispersion of only 0.16 dex.\n\nFigure 1. a) The list of neural transfer functions and b) the empirical networks (1 \u2212 4) deduced by SAGAN during its evolution. Note the transformation to exponential space (e-space) needed to handle negative values of\nlog(S23 ) while keeping the network dimensionless.\n\nIn order to obtain the empirical law, one has to read from right to left from\nthe output variable back through the network to the input variables, applying the\nneuron transfer functions and summing the weighted node paths. The empirical\nrelation for figure 1b)4 for example is,\nlog(S23 )\n)}+8.28ln(e) .\neZ = e{1.36ln(e\n\n(3)\n\nNoting that ln(ex ) = x and equating the exponents of e, we obtain,\nZ = 8.28 + 1.36log (S23 ) .\n\n(4)\n\nThe biggest improvements can be seen to be associated with topological\nchanges in the network. In figure 2, we have extracted the empirical laws from\nthe network and plotted them over the training data. In figure 2a), we can see\nthat after only 3 generations, SAGAN identified a linear fit to the data having a dispersion of 0.22 dex. Although this is slightly higher than the 0.20 dex\ndispersion published for S23 (D\u0131\u0301az & P\u00e9rez-Monetro (2000)), SAGAN rapidly\nimproved upon this in its sixth generation shown in figure 2b) with a sigmoidal\n\n\fOn the deduction of galaxy abundances with evolutionary neural networks\nfit to the data having a dispersion of 0.183 dex. The next improvement occured\nin the 111th generation in figure 2c) when SAGAN found a cubic fit to the data\nhaving a dispersion of 0.181 dex. After 2 days runtime, and after 1352 generations, SAGAN unexpectedly found in figure 2d) a linear fit with a dispersion\nof only 0.16 dex. We left SAGAN running until its 8500th generation and no\nfurther improvement was found. The return to a linear fit after so many generations of evolution needs some comment. Why did SAGAN not find this linear\nfit directly in generation 3? It appears that it has investigated other functional\nforms and then after a process of significant learning has adjusted the gradient\nof the linear fit to minimise the dispersion. Contrary to least squares fitting\nroutines, SAGAN, has experimented with numerous fitting functions and then\nadjusted the most suitable one. We consider this the main advantage of our\nnetwork - that it objectively seeks the best fitting function.\n\nFigure 2.\nThe empirical fits obtained by SAGAN during generations 3, 6,\n111 and 1352 of its evolution. In a) we also plot the linear and quadratic fits\nobtained by D\u0131\u0301az & P\u00e9rez-Monetro (2000).\n\n5\n\n\f6\n4.\n\nM. Taylor and A. I. Diaz\nConclusions and Future Plans\n\nWe have shown that SAGAN produces accurate results that are robust to errors\non the training data. Furthermore, the symbolic equations extracted are the\nbest empirical laws to date that fit observational data of HII regions. The\nfits are consistent with earlier results obtained by subjectively fitting the data\nwith linear and quadratic least-square fitting routines (D\u0131\u0301az & P\u00e9rez-Monetro\n(2000)).\nWith the sample of 96 objects for which we have auroral and nebular emission\nlines of O, N and S, we are now investigating n-dimensional indicators of the\nform Z = f (x1 , x2 , * * * , xn ) + c with each xi involving a line ratio and c is a\nconstant. We will shortly report on SAGAN's findings for these potentially new\nindicators. Additionally, we are compiling a list of relations involving emission\nline ratios of O, N and S that are correlated with metallicity Z, ionisation\nparameter U and effective or equivalent temperature T \u2217 in order to deduce the\nnonlinear relationship f (Z, U, T \u2217) = 0 for application to infrared data in the\nnear future.\nAcknowledgments.
