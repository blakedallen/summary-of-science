For example, the difference between isotropic\nand d\u2212wave pairing of electrons, in conventional and\nhigh-Tc superconductors, respectively, leads to fundamentally different properties [1]. Degenerate quantum\ngases are usually dominated by isotropic (s\u2212wave) contact interactions. Dipolar quantum gases (i.e. in which\nthe dipole-dipole interaction (DDI) between permanent\ndipole moments play a significant or even dominant role)\nare governed by the d\u2212wave symmetry of the long-range\nDDI, which gives rise to novel properties.\nExamples of fascinating predictions for polarized dipolar quantum gases range from a roton-maxon spectrum [2] for the elementary excitations of a quasi twodimensional dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), to\nthe existence of novel quantum phases (such as a 'checkerboard' insulator, or a supersolid) for dipolar quantum\ngases in optical lattices [3]. The DDI also modifies the hydrodynamic equations describing the dynamics of a BEC,\nwhich has been probed experimentally by studying the\nexpansion of the cloud when released from the trap [4].\nUnusual, structured shapes for the BEC have been predicted [5, 6]. In the unpolarized case, the DDI dramatically enriches the physics of spinor BECs [7]. Ultracold\ndipolar fermions also have fascinating properties [8].\nA striking example of the new properties of dipolar\nBECs is given by their stability, which, contrary to the\ncase of contact interaction, depends strongly on the trap\ngeometry. Consider a pancake-shaped trap with the\ndipole moments of the particles oriented perpendicular\nto the plane of the trap. The DDI is then essentially repulsive, and the BEC is stable, independently of the atom\nnumber. In contrast, a cigar-shaped trap cannot stabilize a purely dipolar BEC. We experimentally studied [9]\nthis geometry-dependent stability of a dipolar quantum\ngas by using a 52 Cr BEC, and mapped out the stability\n\ndiagram of the condensate as a function of the scattering length a (characterizing the contact interaction) and\nthe trap aspect ratio. In the case of a pure contact interaction, crossing the stability border into the unstable\nregime a < 0 leads to a collapse of the BEC [10, 11, 12].\nThis gives rise to an interesting dynamics involving a fast\nimplosion of the condensate followed by the formation of\nenergetic 'bursts' of atoms [13], or the formation of soliton trains [14, 15].\nIn this Letter, we investigate experimentally the collapse dynamics of a dipolar 52 Cr BEC when the scattering length a is decreased (by means of a Feshbach\nresonance) below the critical value acrit for stability [9].\nWe observe a rich dynamics on a timescale shorter than\nthe trap period, with the formation of an expanding\nstructure featuring a d\u2212wave symmetry. We study the\natom number in the condensate as a function of time,\nand find an abrupt decrease due to inelastic losses. Finally, we compare our experimental results with a threedimensional numerical simulation of the Gross-Pitaevskii\nequation (GPE) including both contact and dipolar interactions, as well as three-body losses. Such a generalized GPE with three-body losses has been demonstrated\nto explain the main features of 'Bose-nova' experiments\nwith 85 Rb [16]. Here we generalize this model to include\nthe DDI. As shown later, this generalized model accounts\nvery well for the observed d\u2212wave collapse.\nThe experimental setup to produce a 52 Cr BEC above\nthe Feshbach resonance located at a magnetic field B0 \u2243\n589 G has been described elsewhere [9]. Close to the\nresonance, the scattering length a varies with the applied\nmagnetic field B as\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2206\na(B) = abg 1 \u2212\n,\nB \u2212 B0\nwhere \u2206 \u2243 1.5 G is the resonance width, and abg \u2243\n100 a0 the background scattering length (a0 is the Bohr\n\n\f2\n(a)\n\nai\n\n30\n\nthold\n\n(b)\n\nttof\n\ny\n\n20\n\na/a0\n\n0 ms\n\n(c)\n\n0.4 ms\n\n0.5 ms\n\n0.6 ms\n\n0.8 ms\n\n1 ms\ny\n\nB\nz\n\nacrit\n10\n\nz\n\naf\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nt/ms\n\n(d)\n0 ms\n\n0.1 ms\n\n0.2 ms\n\n0.3 ms\n\n0.4 ms\n\n0.5 ms\n\nFIG. 1: (color).

We calibrate the variation a(B) of the scattering\nlength by measuring, after expansion, the BEC size and\natom number [9]. The reduction of a close to B0 + \u2206 is\naccompanied by inelastic losses. By measuring the 1/e\nlifetime and the density of the BEC close to resonance, we\nestimate the three-body loss coefficient to be constant for\nthe range of scattering lengths (5 6 a/a0 6 30) studied\nhere, with a value L3 \u223c 2 \u00d7 10\u221240 m6 /s.\nTo study the collapse dynamics, we first create a\nBEC of typically 20,000 atoms in a trap with frequencies (\u03bdx , \u03bdy , \u03bdz ) \u2243 (660, 400, 530) Hz at a magnetic field\n\u223c 10 G above the Feshbach resonance, where the scattering length is a \u2243 0.9 abg . We then decrease a by ramping\ndown B linearly over 8 ms to a value ai = 30 a0 which still\nlies well above the critical value for collapse, measured to\nbe at acrit \u2243 (15 \u00b1 3) a0 [shaded area on Fig. 1(a)] for our\nparameters [9]. This ramp is slow enough to be adiabatic\n(\u0227/a \u226a \u03bdx,y,z ), so that the BEC is not excited during it.\nAfter 1 ms waiting time, a is finally ramped down rapidly\nto af = 5 a0 , which is below the collapse threshold. For\nthis, we ramp linearly in 1 ms the current I(t) in the coils\nproviding the magnetic field B = \u03b1I. However, due to\neddy currents in the metallic vacuum chamber, the actual value of B(t) and hence that of a(t) change in time\n\nFIG. 2: (color). In-trap column density obtained in the simulation, for different thold . The field of view is 5 \u03bcm by 5\n\u03bcm. Due to the DDI, the condensate collapses radially, acquiring the shape of a very thin cigar elongated along z. At\nthold \u2243 0.5 ms, the collapse occurs, and immediately after,\nthe cloud starts to expand radially.\n\nas depicted in blue on Fig. 1(a). To obtain this curve, we\nused Zeeman spectroscopy to measure the step response\nof B(t) to a jump in the current I(t) (corresponding to a\n\u223c 15 G change in B), and found that the resulting B(t) is\nwell described if \u03c4 \u1e02 + B = \u03b1I(t) holds, with \u03c4 \u2243 0.5 ms.\nFrom this equation and the measured I(t) we determine\nthe actual a(t).\nAfter the ramp, we let the system evolve for an adjustable time thold and then the trap is switched off. Note\nthat the origin of thold corresponds to the end of the\nramp in I(t). Because of eddy currents, thold = 0 about\n0.2 ms before the time at which the scattering length\ncrosses acrit . However, as we shall see below, even for\nthold < 0.2 ms a collapse (happening not in trap, but during the time of flight) is observed, since during expansion\nthe scattering length continues to evolve towards af . The\nlarge magnetic field along z is rapidly turned off (in less\nthan 300 \u03bcs) after 4 ms of expansion, and the condensate expands for another 4 ms in an 11 G field pointing\nin the x direction, before being imaged by absorption of\na resonant laser beam propagating along x. Changing\nthe direction of the field allows us to use the maximum\nabsorption cross-section for the imaging (if the latter was\ndone in high field, the absorption cross-section would be\nsmaller, thus reducing the signal to noise ratio of the\nimages). We checked that this fast switching has no influence on the condensate dynamics. We observe that\nthe atomic cloud has a clear bimodal structure, with a\nbroad isotropic thermal cloud, well fitted by a Gaussian,\nand a much narrower, highly anisotropic central feature,\ninterpreted as the remnant BEC [see Fig. 1(b) and (c)].\nThe upper row of Fig. 1(d) shows the time evolution of the condensate when varying thold . The images\nwere obtained by averaging typically five absorption images taken under the same conditions; the thermal background was subtracted, and the color scale was adjusted\nseparately for each thold for a better contrast. From an\ninitial shape elongated along the magnetization direction z, the condensate rapidly develops a complicated\nstructure with an expanding, torus-shaped part close to\nthe z = 0 plane. Interestingly, the angular symmetry of the condensate at some specific times (e.g. at\nthold = 0.5 ms) is reminiscent of the d\u2212wave angular\nsymmetry 1 \u2212 3 cos2 \u03b8 of the DDI.

The non-unitary term proportional to L3 describes three-body losses. The scattering length a(t) is changed according to the blue curve in\nFig. 1(a) and the trap potential Vtrap is switched off\nat the beginning of the 8 ms time of flight. For the\nsimulation, space is discretized into a 128 \u00d7 128 \u00d7 128\nmesh with a step size of 70 nm. For the kinetic part,\nthe Crank-Nicolson scheme is used for the time evolution\nto avoid numerical instability. For the interaction part,\nthe convolution integral is calculated using a fast Fourier\ntransform. After the trap is switched off, the mesh is\nextended to 512 \u00d7 512 \u00d7 512 to describe the expansion\nof the cloud. When the density becomes low enough so\nthat the nonlinear terms of the GPE can be neglected,\nthe free expansion propagator is used to give the final\ntime-of-flight images. The agreement between the experimental data and the simulation, performed without any\nadjustable parameter, is excellent.\nThe cloverleaf patterns seen in Fig. 1(b)-(d) are caused\nby the anisotropic collapse and the subsequent dynamics\nof the system. Figure 2 shows the in-trap evolution of\nthe condensate as a function of thold . The mechanism\nof the condensate 'explosion' is as follows [18]: When\nthe atomic density grows due to the attractive interaction, three-body losses predominantly occur in the highdensity region. The centripetal force is then decreased,\nand the atoms that gathered in this narrow central region are ejected due to the 'quantum pressure' arising\nfrom the uncertainty principle. The kinetic energy is\nsupplied by the loss of the negative interaction energy.\nFor the contact interaction, the collapse and subsequent\natomic 'explosion' is isotropic [18]. In the present case,\nthe collapse occurs mainly in the x \u2212 y direction due to\nanisotropy of the DDI (in the absence of inelastic losses,\nthe condensate would indeed become an infinitely thin\ncigar-shaped cloud along z, see Fig. 3 of Ref.[9], and the\n\nFIG. 3: (color). Atom losses during collapse. Blue circles: atom number NBEC in the condensate as a function\nof thold . The solid curve is the result of the simulation for\nL3 = 2 \u00d7 10\u221240 m6 /s, without any adjustable parameter.\nInset: the atom number Nthermal in the thermal cloud (red\nsquares) remains essentially constant during the collapse.\n\nin-trap image at thold = 0.5 ms in Fig. 2), and therefore\nthe condensate 'explodes' essentially radially, producing\nthe anisotropic shape of the cloud. The numerical simulation reveals that, for thold < 0.5 ms, the collapse observed in Fig. 1(d) occurs not during the holding time\nbut during the time-of-flight. We stress that in the absence of three-body losses, the explosion following the\ncollapse would not be observed.\nFrom the images, the atom number NBEC in the condensate is obtained by integrating the optical density.\nBlue circles in Fig. 3 show NBEC as a function of thold .\nThe BEC atom number is initially NBEC (0) \u2243 16, 000\nand decreases toward its asymptotic value \u223c 6, 000. Over\nthe same time scale, the atom number Nthermal in the\nthermal cloud (inset of Fig. 3) stays constant. The size\nof the thermal cloud after expansion is also constant over\nthis period. This suggests that the thermal cloud does\nnot play any significant role in the collapse dynamics.\nFor thold < 0.5 ms, the collapse actually occurs during\nthe time of flight, which explains the gradual decay of\nNBEC (thold ), and why the atom losses are not as large\nas those when the collapse occurs in trap (in the latter\ncase, 70% of the atoms are lost). The missing atoms have\nvery likely escaped from the trap as energetic molecules\nand atoms produced in three-body collisions. This is confirmed by the fact that the simulation gives a NBEC (thold )\ncurve (solid line in Fig. 3) which matches well the experimental data. Experimental uncertainties in the parameters used in the simulation (trap frequencies, values of L3\nand \u03c4 ) probably explain the small discrepancy between\nthe experiment and the numerical results.\nThe numerical simulation gives access not only to the\ndensity |\u03c8(r)|2 , but also to the phase S(r) of the order\nparameter \u03c8 (i.e. to the velocity field v = ~\u2207S/m) and\n\n\f4\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\ny\n\ny\nz\n\nz\n\nx\nFIG. 4: (color).

Figure 4(a) shows an in-trap iso-density surface of\na condensate at thold = 0.8 ms and the location of the\nvortex rings (shown as red curves). Comparing Fig. 4(a)\nand Fig. 2 (at thold = 0.8 ms), we find that the topological defects encircle the two 'leaves' of the 'clover'. Figure\n4(b) shows the velocity field v(r) in the x = 0 plane. The\natoms ejected in the x \u2212 y plane flow outward, while the\natoms near the z axis still flow inward, giving rise to the\ncirculation. Thus, the vortex-ring formation is specific to\nthe d\u2212wave collapse induced by the DDI. Although the\nvortex rings are not observed directly in the experiment,\nthe excellent agreement between the experiment and simulation in Figs. 1 and 3 strongly suggests the creation of\nvortex rings during the collapse of the condensate.\nIn conclusion, we have investigated the collapse dynamics of a dipolar BEC. Contrary to the case of an\nisotropic contact interaction, the DDI induces the formation of a structured cloud featuring a d\u2212wave symmetry. The collapse dynamics is quantitatively reproduced by numerical simulations of the GPE without any\nadjustable parameter. An interesting subject for future\nstudies is the dependence of the collapse dynamics on\nthe trap geometry: one may wonder if the condensate\nwould collapse in the same way if initially trapped in a\nvery anisotropic (e.g., pancake-shaped) trap. A natural\nextension of this work would involve detecting, e.g. by\ninterferometric methods [21, 22], the vortex rings predicted by the simulation. Finally, whether one can nucleate stable vortex rings by initiating the collapse, and\nthen changing a back to a value corresponding to a stable BEC, is a question which certainly deserves further\ninvestigations.\nWe thank H.
