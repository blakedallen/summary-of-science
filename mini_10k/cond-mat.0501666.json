Its unpolished surface was mechanically thinned [7], leaving parallel surfaces approximately 50 \u03bcm apart. Platinum was predeposited at 300 K forming a 1000 \u00c5 thick gate electrode\non the thinned back surface and 100 \u00c5 thick measurement electrodes on the epi-polished front surface. The\nsubstrate was then placed in a dilution refrigerator/UHV\ndeposition apparatus [8]. A 10 \u00c5 thick underlayer of\namorphous antimony (a-Sb) followed by subsequent layers of a-Bi were deposited in situ under UHV conditions\n(\u223c 10\u22129 torr) through shadow masks. The substrates\nwere held at liquid-helium temperatures during deposition. Films grown in this manner are believed to be homogeneously disordered [9].\nResistances were measured by employing standard\nfour-probe DC methods using a 1 nA current, a value\nwell within the linear regime of the I-V characteristics. A\nvoltage source provided the gate-film bias. All electrical\nleads were filtered at 300 K with RC filters to attenuate\n60 Hz noise and \u03c0-section filters to attenuate RF noise,\nand at the mixing chamber of the refrigerator with 2 m\nlong Thermocoax cables [10] to attenuate GHz noise. The\nmeasurement and deposition processes were alternated,\nwith the film always kept below 14 K in a UHV environment, permitting the study of the evolution of electrical\ntransport properties with thickness.\nIn the sequence of films in which electrostatic gating was studied, the film thickness was varied from 9.60\n\u00c5 to 10.22 \u00c5 in four steps. All films were insulating,\nwith R(T ) exhibiting a temperature dependence consistent with Mott variable range hopping. All curves exhibited resistance flattening for T . 60 mK. We will argue\nlater that this behavior is not evidence of an intermediate metallic regime. It is believed to be a consequence\nof the electrons in the film failing to cool despite significant efforts to shield from external noise and thermal\nradiation.\nThe 10.22 \u00c5 thick film was the first in the sequence\nin which an electrostatically tuned SI transition (Fig. 1)\ncould be induced. Resistance decreased with increasing\npositive gate voltage (VG ) at all temperatures, consistent\nwith previous observations that the carriers in metallic aBi are electrons [11]. A logarithmic dependence on temperature became a better fit at about 7 V and continued\nto do so for all larger gate voltages at high temperatures\ndespite the presence of superconducting behavior at low\ntemperatures.\nOne can qualitatively distinguish between insulating\nand superconducting ground states by examining the sign\n\nSuperconductivity has been induced in insulating ultrathin films of amorphous bismuth using the electric field effect. The screening of the electron-electron interaction was\nfound to increase with electron concentration in a manner correlated with the tendency towards superconductivity. This\ndoes not preclude an increase in the density of states being important in the development of superconductivity. The\nsuperconductor-insulator transition appears to belong to the\nuniversality class of the three dimensional XY model.\n\nSuperconductor-insulator (SI) transitions in ultrathin\nfilms [1] are believed to be examples of quantum phase\ntransitions (QPTs) [2]. Such transitions occur at zero\ntemperature in response to the tuning of an external parameter of a system that alters its ground state. Although many systems exhibit QPTs, including 4 He adsorbed on random substrates, two-dimensional electron\ngases, and numerous complex strongly correlated electron materials including high temperature superconductors, the SI transition is one of the most fundamental because of its apparent connection with the phase-number\nuncertainty relation of quantum mechanics [3]. The standard approaches to tuning SI transitions involve increasing film thickness and applying perpendicular magnetic\nfields. Both of these can introduce complications. Increasing film thickness changes carrier density but may\nalso alter the disorder landscape. Applying perpendicular magnetic fields introduces vortices and the complexity\nof vortex physics.\nHere we report the electrostatic tuning of the SI transition in ultra-thin amorphous bismuth (a-Bi) films using\nthe electric field effect. This tuning changes the carrier\ndensity without altering the disorder landscape. Modulation of superconductivity using the field effect is an\nold idea [4], which has been revived by recent work on\nhigh temperature (cuprate) superconductors [5,6]. However, these studies have not revealed significant features\nof the transitions between the various ground states. The\ndifficulties of preparing high quality cuprate films with\nthicknesses on the order of the electrostatic screening\nlength and chemically doped so that they are near a\nphase boundary has limited the usefulness of these studies. These constraints are either irrelevant or easily satisfied in work on homogeneously disordered ultra-thin\nfilms.\nA single-crystal of (100) SrTiO3 (STO) served as both\n\n1\n\n\fysis valid when kF l \u226b 1, where kF is the 2D Fermi\nwavevector and l is the electronic mean free path. However, it is possible that this analysis may work even\nwhen kF l & 1. (The value of kF l for these films, estimated from their high temperature conductivity is approximately 1.6.) Thus,\n\nof dR/dT at low temperatures. At low VG , dR/dT < 0,\nsuggesting an insulating state. With increasing VG ,\ndR/dT eventually changed sign, suggesting a superconducting state. Zero resistance, within the limits of the\nscatter of the data, was observed for VG > 38 V. The\nhighest temperature at which zero resistance was observed increased monotonically with VG , from 52 mK at\n38V to 59 mK at 42.5 V. At 42.5 V, all effects due to\ngating saturated, so R(T) for VG > 42.5 V was identical\nto R(T) at 42.5V.\nThe response of the resistance to VG was stronger\nat low temperatures than at high temperatures, implying that the high temperature conductance was affected\nmuch less by electrostatic charging than the superconducting pairing mechanism. The major changes in R(T )\nin response to VG appeared only as low temperature deviations from the weakly insulating VG = 0 curve. Qualitatively similar behavior has been found in the perpendicular magnetic field-tuned SI transition of In2 O3 films\n[12], as well as in studies of the metal-insulator transition\n[13].\nThe inset of Fig. 1 shows the field effect for both signs\nof gate voltage at 65 mK for the 10.22 \u00c5 thick film. Negative VG produces a small change in film resistance, while\npositive VG causes a large decrease. At higher temperatures, all R(T) curves for negative VG largely coincide\nwith the VG = 0 curve. Thus hopping transport is only\nchanged a small amount. Similarly, for a 10.69 \u00c5 thick\nfilm (not shown) with a 446 mK transition temperature,\nthe asymmetry in the response for the two signs of gate\nvoltage was evident in that for VG = 50 V, Tc increased\nto 502 mK, while for VG = \u221250 V, it decreased only to\n436 mK. This film was prepared in an earlier sequence of\ndepositions in which the superconductor-insulator transition was overshot.\nMeasurements at low temperatures using thinned STO\nas a gate dielectric have demonstrated that electron\ntransfer is approximately linear with gate voltage from\nzero at VG = 0 to approximately 3 \u00d7 1013 cm\u22122 at VG =\n50 V [7] and it does not saturate above that value. Thus,\nthe observed saturation of film behavior cannot result\nfrom properties of the gate dielectric. The film's intrinsic electron concentration is unknown, as the geometry\nin this particular set of studies was limited to parallel\nmagnetic fields, precluding Hall effect measurements.\nThe simplicity of electrostatic charging as a tuning\nparameter provides an opportunity to analyze data in\nways not possible for either the thickness or magnetic\nfield tuned SI transitions. The behavior of R(T) at high\ntemperatures, as a function of gate voltage, can reveal\nfeatures of the disordered 2D electron system relevant\nto its superconductivity. In 2D metals, in zero magnetic field, the conductance is the sum of the classical\nBoltzmann conductance (GB ) and corrections due to coherent backscattering/weak localization (GW L ) [14] and\nelectron-electron interactions (GEE ) [15]. Both produce\na decrease in conductance that goes as the logarithm\nof temperature. This is based on a perturbative anal-\n\n3\ne2\nGW L (T ) + GEE (T ) = [\u03b1p + (1 \u2212 F \u2217 )] 2 ln(T )\n4\n2\u03c0 h\nThe weak localization correction is determined by the\ntemperature exponent of the inelastic scattering time,\np, and the localization parameter, \u03b1. The interaction\nterm is controlled by a screening parameter, F \u2217 , which\nincreases from 0 to 0.866 as the electron-electron interaction changes from being unscreened to completely\nscreened. The inset to Fig. 2 shows a plot of G vs. ln(T )\nfor the VG = 12.5 V curve of the 10.22 \u00c5 thick film. This\ncurve is nonlinear at low T because the system in tending\ntowards superconductivity. For T >175 mK, the curve is\nlinear in ln(T ), and the coefficient of the logarithm depends on the values of \u03b1p and F \u2217 . Assuming the weak\nlocalization contribution, \u03b1p, to be constant for all VG ,\nby subtracting slopes of G(ln(T )) at nonzero VG from\nthe slope of G(ln(T )) at VG = 0, one can determine the\nvalue of \u2206F \u2217 = F \u2217 (VG ) \u2212 F \u2217 (VG = 0). This function,\nwhich is then the increase in screening constant induced\nby gate voltage, relative to the screening constant intrinsic to the ungated film, is shown in figure 2. F \u2217 increases\nmonotonically by approximately 0.35 from VG = 0 to\nVG = 42.5 V. F \u2217 will increase with this functional form,\nno matter the precise value of \u03b1p or F \u2217 (VG = 0). (Note\nthat in this analysis, we force a logarithmic fit to the\nexponential insulating curves. This is fairly accurate at\ntemperatures higher than roughly 150 mK.) A positive\nmagnetoresistance, logarithmic in B, that would allow\ndetermination of \u03b1p and of F \u2217 (VG = 0) is expected in\nfields B >> kB T /g\u03bcB . We observed positive magnetoresistance for all B at 300 mK at VG = 10 V, but no\nspecific field dependence could be determined.\nThe increase in F \u2217 with VG is correlated with the\nenhancement of the tendency towards superconductivity. In conventional metals the latter is controlled by\nthe competition between the Coulomb repulsion and\nthe phonon-mediated attractive interaction. Increased\nscreening leads to the suppression of Coulomb repulsion, ultimately permitting superconductivity to develop.\nOnce superconductivity is achieved, increased screening\nshould move Tc to higher temperatures. Saturation of\nboth Tc and F \u2217 with VG might not be unexpected in the\nlimit of strong metallicity, as the density of states for a 2D\nmetal is a constant independent of carrier concentration.\nThe electron density determines the value of conductivity at high temperatures. Since a major change in the\nlow temperature behavior occurs without a substantial\nchange in the resistance at higher temperatures, screening, which changes significantly, and not the areal charge\ndensity, might be controlling the transition to superconductivity. However, in the BCS model, the product of the\n2\n\n\fscaling branch. The bottom curve is for the lowest temperature and appears to adhere to the scaling function.\nCurves generated from data taken at increased temperatures deviate at higher values of R/RC . This implies\nthat scaling works best at the lowest temperatures. In\nthis work, all R(T) curves tend toward becoming temperature independent below approximately 60 mK. Curves\nfor which 11 V < VG < 38 V have nonzero resistance at\nthe lowest measured temperature, while curves for which\nVG \u2265 38 V show zero resistance. The fact that all R(T)\ncurves from both groups satisfy the same scaling function\nfor the same \u03bdz suggests that these two regimes are not\ndifferent. This is the main reason for our earlier assertion\nthat in this instance the observed flattening of resistance\nis not intrinsic. In other experimental situations, the\nflattening could be a real metallic phase.\nAny scaling analysis has a lower temperature bound.\nThus, data that appear on the insulating branch may actually belong on the superconducting one, as R(T) curves\nthat appear to be insulating might actually be observed\nto be superconducting if lower temperatures became accessible. The continuous nature of the scaling function\nat the zero of |VG \u2212 VGC | would allow for a higher critical\nresistance than that identified here without change of the\ncritical exponent product.\nThe electrostrictive response of STO can be ruled out\nas an explanation of the observed effects because R(VG )\nis asymmetric in VG while the electrostrictive response of\nSTO is symmetric [7].\nThe thinness (10\u00c5) of the a-Sb layer rules out the possibility that screening may be caused by an accumulation of a mobile charge at the interface between the STO\nsubstrate and the a-Sb layer, similar to the field-effect\nmodulation found between STO and Al2 O3 [21]. The\nfact that negative gate voltage causes little if any change\nin the film is different from what was found in previous\nwork on a-Bi grown on a- Ge [22].\nIn summary, the electric field effect has been used to\ntune the 2D SI transition. The evolution of superconductivity is correlated with an increase in screening. The\nsize of the critical regime appears to be quite small. The\nexponent product \u03bdz \u223c 2/3 is found, so the universality\nclass of the transition appears to be that of the 3D XY\nmodel. This product is different from the value \u03bdz \u223c 4/3\nthat has been found in numerous previous experiments,\nwhich has been suggested to be a signature of classical\npercolation in 2D [20]. It is possible that the underlying\nmechanism for this electrostatically tuned transition is\ndifferent from those in studies that are tuned by changing film thickness or applying magnetic fields.\nThe authors would like to acknowledge very useful conversations with Boris Shklovskii, Anatoly Larkin, Leonid\nGlazman, Oriol Valls, and Alex Kamenev.

Therefore, an increase in the\ndensity of states may also contribute to the inducing of\nsuperconductivity.\nThe asymmetry of the response to the sign of VG would\nsuggest that the Fermi energy of the ungated film is close\nto the mobility edge. Increasing the electron concentration with positive VG would then increase the screening\nand the density of states significantly, whereas decreasing\nthe electron concentration with negative VG would result\nin small changes in the hopping transport, screening and\nthe density of states.\nIt is expected that conductivity data associated with\ncontinuous QPTs can be collapsed using a finite-size scaling analysis [2]. As data has been acquired at increasingly\nlower temperatures, such analyses have been observed to\nfail because of flattening of the curves of R(T). Scaling\nalso appears to fail when curves of R(T) that exhibit the\nonset of superconducting behavior fan down from weakly\ninsulating curves. In the present work, finite size scaling\nof R(T) data with VG as the tuning parameter was successful because we confined the temperature range and\nused fine increments of values of the control parameter.\nAll data for T \u2264 60 mK was excluded, assuming that\nthe observed flattening of R(T) was due to a failure to\ncool the electrons. In the inset of Fig. 3, R(VG ) is plotted at fixed temperature for fifteen isotherms between\n65 mK and 100 mK. This yields a well-defined crossing\npoint at VG = 11 V, which is taken to be the critical\nvalue of the tuning parameter, VGC . The critical resistance (RC ) of 19,100 \u03a9 is large in comparison with values\nfound for the SI transition with other tuning parameters.\nPlotting R/RC versus |VG \u2212 VGC |T \u22121/\u03bdz for 54 values\nof VG between 0 and 42.5 V, the product \u03bdz = 2/3 is\nfound to yield the best collapse of data onto two separate\nbranches, one for superconducting films and the other for\ninsulating films. This is shown in Fig. 3. Assuming the\nvalue of z to be 1, the value \u03bd = 2/3 is consistent with\nthe universality classes of either the three dimensional\n(3D) XY or inverse XY models. The latter is believed\nto describe the transition to superconductivity in 3D [16]\nand might be expected for a QPT in a system governed\nby the 2D XY model at nonzero temperature with z = 1\n[2]. This value of the exponent product is different from\nthose found using thickness as a tuning parameter for aBi films [1] and magnetic field as a tuning parameter for\nInOx [17] and MoGe [18] films, but is consistent with a\nstudy of the magnetic field tuned transition in a-Bi films\n[19].\nThe breakdown of scaling when data above 0.1 K is included suggests that the critical regime only extends from\nzero to some low temperature on the order of 0.1 K. Except for the limited temperature range, the quality of the\ncurve is as good as or better than that of earlier scaling\nanalyses, from the highest value of R/RC down to 0.6 and\nfor a range of |VG \u2212 VGC |T \u22121/vz extending from 0 to over\n700. The analysis is shown down to R/RC = 0 to demonstrate how isotherms deviate from the superconducting\n3\n\n\f[1] A. M. Goldman and N.
