Bir\u00f3,\nMTA RMKI, H-1525 Budapest, P.O.Box 49\nOctober 24, 2018\nAbstract\nWe point out that a certain finite size effect in heavy ion physics, the\ncanonical enhancement, is based on the difference of conservation constrained pair statistics for Poisson and Gauss distributions, respectively.\nConsequently it should occur in a wide range of phenomena, whenever\ncomparing rare and frequent events.\n\nIt is often so, in particular in relativistic heavy ion collisions observing thousands of newly produced particles in an event, that only statistical information\nis available for tracing back characteristica of an earlier stage of interacting matter. Aiming at the discovery of quark gluon plasma it is especially important\nto be aware of an unavoidable loss of information due to the very nature of\nstatistics. Selecting out, however, relevant control parameters even statistical\ninformation can be used to make qualitative distinctions with respect to the\nkind of matter existed for a while in such experiments, in particular drawing\nconclusions about a possible equation of state.\nA truly interesting control parameter is the size of the reacting system, which\nis often regarded as infinite in theory (as the so called thermodynamical limit).\nIn reality it is, however, finite and to a certain degree controllable in experiments by varying the target nucleus and triggering measurements by centrality\n(multiplicity, transverse energy) of a collision. But even accepting the infinite\nsize assumption (theoretically in any high energy collision even infinitely many\nparticle pairs can be created for a while), there is a further distinction related\nto the mean particle number in an event.\nTwo famous, very characteristic limits can be considered: i) the limiting\ncase of frequent events producing many particles on the mean, approximately\ndescribed by the Gauss distribution, and ii) very rare events with few (less than\n\n1\n\n\fone) particles per event as a mean value, generally covered by the Poisson distribution. In this letter we point out that a characteristic finite size effect in\nrelativistic heavy ion collisions, named canonical enhancement, can be understood as originating in the difference between rare and frequent events, between\nsparse and cupious particle production. Mathematically this reveals itself in the\ndifference between a large and a small mean particle number. The large number\ncase - as it is well known - gives results equivalent to those stemming from a\nGauss distribution (central limit theorem of statistics).\nThe latter equivalence is the basis of the equivalence of the canonical and\ngrand canonical approaches in the thermodynamical limit, while the Poisson\nstatistics with a small mean number plots the difference between these approaches. The ratio of the canonical and grand canonical result in small systems\nis less than one, the same result can be obtained simply relying on the Poisson\ndistribution alone. The effect is in principle more general than the canonical \u2013 grand canonical distinction; processes and phenomena featuring Poisson\nstatistics occur also in physical situations far from equilibrium. Conversely,\nobservation of this deviation signals truly a mesoscopic nature of the physical\nsystem (a fireball formed in heavy ion collisions), but does not prove in itself\nequilibrium, nor measures temperature or volume of the system. The mesoscopic nature reflected by the 'canonical' suppression factor can be extracted\nfrom mean particle numbers alone.\nThe importance of this finite size effect for relativistic heavy ion collisions, in\nparticular its explanation power for finding more strange particles per nucleon\nproduced in ion - ion than in proton - proton collisions (the so called strangeness\nenhancement), was first realized by Redlich et. al.[1, 2]. Originally presented as\na constraint stemming from the proper statistical treatment of a U(1) symmetry\nin the canonical approach (whence the name canonical enhancement)[3], and referring to volume and temperature during the derivation of the result, soon was\nit rederived on the basis of rate equations[4], and has been shown that there can\nbe an underlying master equation with the Poisson distribution as stationary\nsolution. Rafelski and Letessier emphasized that this phenomenon is strongly\nrelated to pair statistics (to associated production of conserved charge and anticharge) and it holds also out of chemical equilibrium with general fugacity\nfactors[5]. Also a debate has been started about the relevance of this effect on\nthe strangeness enhancement in heavy ion collisions, especially at CERN SPS\nusing 40, 60 and 160 GeV/nucleon beam energies.\nOur aim in this letter is to rederive the canonical enhancement factor relying\non the Poisson distribution alone, not assuming even thermal equilibrium in the\nbackground. One does not need to refer either to temperature nor to volume\nin this derivation, \u2013 even if also thermal systems in a given volume may show\nPoisson statistics, this is not their only possible origin. Then we apply this finite\nnumber suppression factor to an analysis of particle production in the frame-\n\n2\n\n\fwork of the sudden quark coalescence picture of hadron formation, ALCOR[6].\nWe recover qualitatively the linear coalescence assumption for the low particle\nnumber case, i.e. that the number of composite objects (mesons and baryons)\nare proportional to the product of the numbers of its constituents (the quarks\nand antiquarks).\nFrom the probability P (n) of getting n particles of a certain kind the expectation value hni and higher moments like quadratic spread can easily be\nobtained by the use of the following generating function:\nX\nZ(\u03b3) =\nP (n)e\u03b3n .\n(1)\nn\n\nThe expected (mean) number becomes\nhni =\n\n\u2202\nlog Z\n\u2202\u03b3\n\n.\n\n(2)\n\n\u03b3=0\n\nUnder certain circumstances we are particularly interested in pairs of particles\ncarrying a sum or a difference of a given physical quantity, than in the oneparticle distribution. On the basis of independent one-particle distributions the\npair statistics and the distribution of the sum can be calculated. Without any\nconstraint on the difference, the distribution of the sum is described by the\nconvolution of the corresponding distributions:\nX\nX\nPU (s) =\nP1 (n)P2 (m)\u03b4m+n,s =\nP1 (n)P2 (s \u2212 n).\n(3)\nn,m\n\nn\n\nThis is, however, correct only if there is no information on the difference. In\nparticular the production of particles and antiparticles happens always in pairs\ndue to charge (and further) conservation laws, and as a consequence, even if the\nproduction process is statistical, their difference is bounded to be zero. In this\ncase we obtain another distribution of the sum:\nPC (s|0) =\n\nP1 (s/2)P2 (s/2)\n1 X\nP1 (n)P2 (m)\u03b4m+n,s \u03b4m\u2212n,0 = P\n.\nP0 m,n\nn P1 (n)P2 (n)\n\n(4)\n\nThis is a conditional probability with the factor P0 being the probability of getting zero difference in the number statistically, which ensures the normalization\nof the result to one. Fig.1 shows a geometrical interpretation of the distinction between these two pair statistics: the unconstrained distribution can be\nobtained by adding all points in (n, m) space over a given bin of the diagonal\nrepresenting a given sum s = n + m, while in case of the fixed zero difference\nonly hits in the diagonal stripe counts (and the ratio of the stripe to the total\narea reflects the 1/P0 normalization factor).\n\n3\n\n\f20\n\n15\n\n10\nm\n\n5\n\n0\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\nn\n\nFig.1\nDemonstrating the constrained (main diagonal stripe) and uncostrained (the\nwhole square) distribution of the sum of two Poisson deviates with mean value 10 for\neach.\nApplying this idea to restless coalescence of quarks into hadrons, we still\nconstrain the difference to zero, but this time due to a confinement principle.\nThe number of coalesced hadrons is the half sum in this case. Caring for pions\nonly in a simplified world of light quarks and antiquarks, we arrive at having n\nfrom both, with zero difference and a sum of 2n forming exactly n pions. The\ngenerating function of the constrained distribution PC (s|0) in this case reads as\nZC (\u03b3) =\n\n1 X\nPq (n)Pq (n)e2\u03b3n .\nP0 n\n\n(5)\n\nAssuming Poisson distribution for the quarks this generating function becomes\nZC (\u03b3) =\n\np\n1 X hqin \u2212hqi hqin \u2212hqi \u03b3n\n1 \u2212hqi\u2212hqi\ne =\nI0 (2e\u03b3 hqihqi).\ne\ne\ne\nP0 n n!\nn!\nP0\n\n(6)\n\nwith I0 (x) being the Bessel function of the first kind with imaginary argument.\nThe normalization factor 1/P0 can be obtained from Z(0) = 1, giving\np\nI0 (2e\u03b3 hqihqi)\np\nZC (\u03b3) =\n.\n(7)\nI0 (2 hqihqi)\nThe expectation value of the pions is\np\n1\nh\u03c0iP = hsi = hqihqi\n2\n\np\nhqihqi)\np\n,\nI0 (2 hqihqi)\n\nI1 (2\n\n(8)\n\nwith the label P reminding us to the Poisson distribution. For small mean\nnumber of quarks this leads to the product assumption of the simple linear\ncoalescence model:\n(9)\nh\u03c0iP \u2248 2hqihqi.\n4\n\n\fFor large mean numbers on the other hand the ratio of the Bessel functions,\nI1 /I0 approaches one. This latter factor is the canonical suppression factor.\nAs opposed to the above analysis of the Poisson distribution, for the Gauss\ndistribution both the unconstrained and the zero difference constrained pair\nstatistics leads again to a Gauss distribution (but with a larger width). Assuming Gauss distributed quark and antiquark numbers with respective square\nwidths equal to the mean values, as it is typical for equilibrium ideal gases, the\nexpectation value of the half sum, the pion number becomes the harmonic mean\nof the expectations (because by convolution of Gauss distributions the inverse\nsquare widths are additive):\nh\u03c0iG =\n\n2hqihqi\n.\nhqi + hqi\n\n(10)\n\nIn case of zero baryon charge hqi = hqi and these formuli reduce to a very simple\nresult:\nI1 (2hqi)\nh\u03c0iG = hqi;\nh\u03c0iP = hqi\n.\n(11)\nI0 (2hqi)\nAs a consequence one can express canonical enhancement in this case as a relation between Poisson and Gauss expectation values.\nIt is particularily interesting when we compare rare particles, for example\nK + mesons coalesced from Poisson distributed u and s quarks with copiusly\nproduced \u03c0 + pions glued from u and d quarks. The expected meson numbers,\n\u221a\n\u221a\nI1 (2 us)\n+\n\u221a\n,\n(12)\nhK iP = us\nI0 (2 us)\nfor kaons and\nh\u03c0 + iG =\n\n2ud\nu+d\n\n(13)\n\nfor pions (with u, s and d denoting here the expectation values of the respective\nquark numbers) for a baryon free and strangeness free, and isotopically symmetric fireball due to d = d = u = u and s = s = f d with a fixed strangeness\nratio f = d/s reduce to\n\u221a\np\nI1 (2u f )\n\u221a\n(14)\nhK + iP = u f\nI0 (2u f )\nand\nh\u03c0 + iG = u.\n\n(15)\n\nIn this simplified scenario the kaon to pion ratio can be expressed as a function\nof the pion number and so can be compared with experimental results. Of\ncourse the result can only be qualitative on this level, since by using the above\n5\n\n\fassumptions for the quark and antiquark numbers, one is bound to predict the\nsame ratio for K + /\u03c0 + and for K \u2212 /\u03c0 \u2212 . It is not quite fulfilled in experiments:\ncomparing the heavy ion results with those of proton - proton collisions, these\nratios increase by a factor of roughly 2 and 1.6 respectively[7].\nThe result of this simple\nidea can be inspected in Fig.2, where the normalized\n\u221a\n\u221a\nratio hK + iP /(h\u03c0 + iG f is plotted versus the scaled pion number, 2h\u03c0 + iG f .\nThis is exactly the canonical suppression factor. Using the value f \u2248 0.5 for\nestimating the Wroblinski factor f one concludes that the kaon / pion ratio falls\nto its half at an expected pion number of about 0.5 as compared to large pion\nnumbers. This value corresponds to a situation before resonance decays, so it\nis not directly observable in experiments, but correcting for resonance decays is\nalways possible in the framework of a tehoretical model. We used ALCOR for\nthis purpose and concluded that the kaon-pion ratios normalized to the pp case\ndo not change much due to resonance decay, as the unnormalized ratios do.\n\n1.2\n1\n0.8\nK 0.6\n---1/2\n\u03c0f\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n2\u03c0 f\n\n1/2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nFig.2\nCanonical suppression factor obtained from the expectation value of the sum\nof two (numerically simulated) Poisson distributions. It coincides with the analytically\nderived ratio of two Bessel functions I1 /I0 .\nAssuming that both pions and kaons are constructed from Poisson distributed quarks, their ratio changes between two limiting values corresponding\nto few and many quarks respectively:\n\u221a\np\nI1 (2u f ) I0 (2u)\nhKiP\n\u221a\n= f\n,\n(16)\nh\u03c0iP\nI0 (2u f ) I1 (2u)\n\n6\n\n\f\u221a\ngives f for u \u226a 1 and f for u \u226b 1. Considering the light quark (pion) number\nbefore resonance decay the former case is realized in pp collisions (according\nto ALCOR h\u03c0i \u223c 0.1) and the latter case in P bP b collisions (h\u03c0i \u223c 10, before\nresonance decay). The double ratio,\n(K/\u03c0)P bP b\n1\n\u2248\u221a\n(K/\u03c0)pp\nf\n\n(17)\n\nwould be about 1.4, which is to be compared with the experimental values 1.6\nfor negative and 2 for positive kaon to pion ratios. The transition is around\nh\u03c0i \u2248 0.7 . . . 1.4, probably occuring in a collision of relatively light ions.\nIn conclusion we pointed out that the canonical suppression factor of a ratio\nof Bessel functions can be derived solely relying on properties of the Poisson distribution, and hence is only as much related to thermal equilibrium properties\nas the latter realizes a Poisson distribution for rare particles. This distribution,\nhowever, may stem also from a series of dynamical events and therefore the corresponding factor should show in a wide class of phenomena. We gave a rough\nestimate of reflecting this size (expected number) dependence in heavy ion collisions by the strangeness enhancement in the framework of a quark coalescence\nhadronization model, ALCOR.\nAcknowledgement Discussions with K.
