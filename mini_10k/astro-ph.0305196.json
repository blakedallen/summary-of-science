The first pioneering efforts of the\nDUMAND [4] collaboration were followed by the successful deployments of\nNT-200 at Lake Baikal [5] and AMANDA [6] at the South Pole. These detectors have demonstrated the feasibility of large neutrino telescopes in open\nmedia like water or ice. They have observed neutrinos produced in the atmosphere [7] and have put limits on the flux of extraterrestrial neutrinos [8,9],\nwhich are significantly below those obtained from the much smaller underground neutrino detectors [10,46]. The results obtained so far, and further\nrefinements to astrophysical theories of extra-terrestrial neutrino fluxes from\ncosmic sources have provided the impetus to construct a neutrino observatory on a much larger scale. Proposals for a detector in the deep water of\nthe Mediterranean have come from the ANTARES [12], NESTOR [13] and\nNEMO [14] collaborations. IceCube is a projected cubic kilometer under ice\nneutrino detector [15,16,17], to be located near the geographic South Pole in\nAntarctica.\n3\n\n\fThe IceCube detector will consist of optical sensors deployed at depth into the\nthick Polar ice sheet. The ice will serve as Cherenkov medium for secondary\nparticles produced in neutrino interactions in or around the instrumented\nvolume. The successful deployment and operation of the AMANDA detector\nhave shown that the Polar ice sheet is a suitable medium for a large neutrino\ntelescope and the analysis of the AMANDA data proves the science potential\nof such a detector.\nIceCube will offer great advantages over AMANDA beyond its larger size: It\nwill have a higher efficiency and a better angular resolution in reconstructing tracks, it will map electromagnetic and hadronic showers (cascades) from\nelectron- and tau-neutrino interactions and, most important, it will have a\nsuperior energy resolution. Simulations, backed by AMANDA data, indicate\nthat the direction of muons can be determined with sub-degree accuracy and\ntheir energy measured to better than 30% in the logarithm of the energy. The\ndirection of electron neutrinos that have produced electromagnetic cascades\nwill be reconstructed to better than 25\u25e6 and the response in energy is linear\nwith a resolution better than 10% in the logarithm of the energy [17]. Energy\nresolution is critical because no atmospheric muon or neutrino background\nexceeds 1 PeV in a cubic-kilometer detector and full sky coverage is achieved.\nIceCube will be able to investigate a large variety of scientific questions in\nastronomy, astrophysics, cosmology and particle physics [17,23]. In this paper\nwe will focus on the IceCube performance in searching for TeV to PeV muon\nneutrinos, as expected from sources such as active galactic nuclei, gamma-ray\nbursts or other cosmic accelerators observed as TeV gamma ray emitters. We\nwill present the results of a Monte Carlo study, including the simulation of\nthe detector and the full analysis chain from filtering of the triggered data to\nevent reconstruction and selection. We will assess basic detector parameters\nlike the pointing resolution and the effective area of the detector directly from\nsimulated data. Further, we present a detailed calculation of the sensitivity of\nthe detector to both diffuse and point-like neutrino emission following generic\nenergy spectra, providing a benchmark sensitivity for some of the fundamental\ngoals of high energy neutrino astronomy.\n\n2\n\nThe IceCube Detector\n\nThe IceCube detector is planned as a cubic kilometer successor to the AMANDA\ndetector, currently operated at the South Pole. It will consist of 4800 photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) of 10 inch diameter, each enclosed in a transparent\npressure sphere. These optical modules (OMs) will be deployed into vertical\nholes drilled to a depth of 2400 m with pressurized hot water. As a significant\nimprovement over the AMANDA technology, each OM will also house the\n4\n\n\fOld\n\nPole\n\nSta\n\ntion\n\nline\n\nAMANDA\u2212II\n\nSPASE\u22122\n\nGrid\nnorth\n\n125 m\n\nRun\n\nway\n\nSouth\nPole\n\nDome\n\nFig. 1. Schematic diagram of the arrangement of the strings of the IceCube detector\nat the South Pole station. The existing AMANDA detectors and the SPASE air\nshower array will be embedded in the new detector.\n\nelectronics to digitize the PMT pulses, retaining the full waveform information [17,18]. The digitized signals will be transmitted by twisted pair cables\nto the surface data acquisition system. Adjacent OMs will be connected via\na separate twisted pair cable, which makes possible a local level-one hardware trigger in the ice. Local triggers will be combined by surface processors\nto form a global trigger. Triggered events will be filtered and reconstructed\non-line, and the relevant information will be transmitted via satellite to the\nnorthern hemisphere.\nThe dark noise rate of an OM will be 300-500 Hz. This low rate is due to\nthe sterile and low temperature environment of the deep Antarctic ice. The\nabsorption length of light from UV to blue varies between 50 m and 150 m,\ndepending on depth. This allows photons to be collected even from very distant\ntracks. In fact, many of the photons will be delayed by scattering in the ice,\nbut the some trajectory information may be retrieved from the dispersedsignal PMT pulse shapes. The single-pulse timing accuracy will be about 5 ns,\nthe sampling period 2-3 ns and the double pulse resolution close to 6 ns. The\ndynamic range of one PMT will be about 200 photo-electrons per 15 ns, and\nseveral thousand photo-electrons integrated over the full waveform from a\ndistant light source.\nA central feature of the system is automatic time and amplitude calibration,\ncritical for a large array at remote location. Each OM will be equipped with\n5\n\n\fa set of bright 370 nm LED pulsers. The LED signals, an essential part of\nthe calibration system, can be seen by OMs as far away as 200 m from their\nsource LEDs.\nThe OMs will be deployed on 80 vertical strings, each carrying 60 OMs spaced\nby 17 m. The instrumented volume will span a depth ranging from 1400 m to\n2400 m below the ice surface. The strings will be arranged in a triangular pattern such that the distances between each string and its six nearest neighbors\nare 125 m. This configuration is the result of an extensive optimization procedure [19,20], covering arrays with the number of OMs ranging from 2400 (half\nthe design number) to 9600 (twice the design number), with equally spaced\nstrings, nested sub-arrays of larger density, and a variety of \"exotic\" configurations. A schematic sketch of the spatial string arrangement is shown in figure\n1. The complete detector will be operational perhaps as soon as five years\nafter the start of construction, but during construction all deployed strings\nwill produce high quality data for the collaboration to analyze.\nThe IceCube array deep in the ice will be complemented by IceTop, a surface\nair shower array consisting of a set of 160 frozen water tanks. The tanks will\nbe arranged in pairs, separated by a few meters, on top of each IceCube string.\nIceTop is the logical extension of the SPASE surface array [21] which already is\na unique asset for AMANDA. The data of the air-shower parameters measured\nat the surface combined with the signal of the high energy muon component\nunder-ice provide a new measure for the primary composition of cosmic rays.\nFurthermore, IceTop will serve as a veto for air-shower-induced background\nand it will provide cross checks for the detector geometry calibration, absolute\npointing accuracy and angular resolution. In addition, the energy deposited by\ntagged muon bundles in air-shower cores will be an external source for energy\ncalibration.\n\n3\n\nSimulation and Analysis Chain\n\nThe science potential of a kilometer scale neutrino telescope has been assessed\nin previous papers by convoluting the expected neutrino induced muon flux\nfrom various astrophysical sources with an assumed square kilometer effective\ndetector area [22,23,24]. In this work we use a full simulation of the event triggering, reconstruction and data selection to assess the detector capabilities.\nThe simulation of the detector and the analysis of the Monte Carlo data rely\non the software packages presently provided by the AMANDA collaboration\n[25,40]. This means that the software concepts and analysis techniques used\nhere have proven capable and have been verified by real data taken with the\nAMANDA detector. However, a full simulation of the IceCube hardware was\nnot possible with the present software: The simulated data correspond to the\n6\n\n\foriginal AMANDA read-out, which does not yield the PMT waveforms. Advanced analysis methods which take advantage of this additional information\nwere not applied and hence we may yield a conservative picture of the IceCube\nperformance.\nA brief outline of the different stages in the used processing chain is given in\nthe following sections.\n3.1 Event Generation\nThe backgrounds for searches for extraterrestrial neutrinos come from the decay of mesons produced from cosmic ray (CR) interactions in the atmosphere.\nThe decay products include both muons and neutrinos. The muons will be\nresponsible for the vast majority of triggers, since they are very penetrating\nand are thus capable to reach the detector depth. Air-shower induced events\ncan be identified by the fact that they involve exclusively down-going tracks\nand a comparatively small deposit of Cherenkov light in the detector, as the\nmuons will have lost most of their energy upon reaching the detector. However, an up-going track might be faked if two uncorrelated air-showers produce\ntime-coincident muons within the detector. In fact, about three percent of all\ntriggered events will be caused by muons from two independent air-showers.\nThe simulation packages Basiev [26] and Corsika [27] were used for the CR\ninduced muon background. Roughly 2.4 million events containing muon tracks\nfrom one single air shower (Atm \u03bcsingle ) were simulated with primary energies\nup to 108 GeV. High energy events as well as events that contain tracks close\nto the horizon were oversampled, in order to achieve better statistics at high\nanalysis levels. In addition, we have simulated one million events containing\ntracks from two independent air-showers (Atm \u03bcdouble ).\nThe muons induced by atmospheric neutrinos (Atm \u03bd) form a background\nover 4\u03c0 sr and up to very high energies. However, the energy spectrum of atmospheric neutrinos falls steeply like dN\u03bd /dE\u03bd \u221d E\u03bd\u22123.7 , whereas one expects\nan energy spectrum as hard as E \u22122 from shock acceleration mechanisms in\nanticipated cosmic TeV-neutrino sources. Therefore, cosmic neutrino energies\nshould extend to higher values and cause more light in the detector than will\natmospheric neutrinos. The amount of light observed in an event is therefore\nuseful as a criterion to separate high energy muons induced by cosmic neutrinos from those induced by atmospheric neutrinos. An uncertainty in the flux\nof atmospheric neutrinos arises from the poorly known contribution of prompt\ndecays of charmed mesons produced in the atmosphere [28,29].\nNeutrino induced events have been simulated with the program nusim [30].\nNeutrinos are sampled from a 1/E spectrum and are later re-weighted to pro7\n\n\fduce different energy spectra as required. The code includes a simulation of\nthe neutrino propagation through the Earth, taking into account absorption\nin charged current interactions as well as neutral current regeneration. The\nneutrino cross sections are calculated using the MRSG [31] parton distributions. The column density of nucleons to be traversed is calculated according\nto the Preliminary Reference Earth Model [32]. Muons that are produced in\nthe rock beneath the detector are propagated to the rock/ice boundary using the Lipari-Stanev [33] muon propagation code. In total we have simulated\n7.4*105 events induced by neutrinos with primary energies up to 108 GeV. The\nflatness of the simulated 1/E neutrino spectrum leads to an oversampling of\nevents at high energies for most of the energy spectra investigated.\nFor \"conventional\" flux of atmospheric neutrinos (i.e. the component related\nto decays of pions and kaons) we apply the prediction calculated by Lipari\n[34]. For the prompt charm contribution we compare two different estimates:\nThe \"Recombination Quark Parton Model\" (rqpm) developed by Bugaev et\nal. [35] and the model by Thunman et al. (TIG) [36]. The latter model\npredicts a substantially smaller rate and may serve as a lower limit for the\nprompt charm contribution.\nFor the flux of extraterrestrial neutrinos (Cosmic \u03bd) we apply a generic\nE \u22122 energy spectrum, as expected from shock acceleration. We use a source\nstrength of E\u03bd2 \u00d7 dN\u03bd /dE\u03bd = 10\u22127cm\u22122 s\u22121 sr\u22121 GeV as a benchmark diffuse\nflux of extraterrestrial neutrinos. This is an order of magnitude below present\nexperimental limits set on the flux of muon neutrinos [9] or electron neutrinos\n[37].\n\n3.2 Muon Propagation\n\nThe propagation of muons through the ice is modeled with either the code by\nLohmann, Kopp and Voss [38] (for muon energies smaller than 105.5 GeV) or\nthe code by Lipari and Stanev [33] (for muon energies greater than 105.5 GeV).\nThese codes calculate the stochastic radiative and nuclear interactive energy\nlosses along the muon track within or close to the detector instrumented volume.\nThe complete tracking of all Cherenkov photons produced by the muon and\nassociated stochastic radiative energy losses for each event would require an\nimpractical amount of computing power. Therefore, the photon amplitudes\nand timing distributions at all points in space from both a muon and an electromagnetic cascade are pre-calculated and tabulated into fast lookup tables\nusing the PTD [39] software package. This simulation takes into account the\nscattering and absorption properties of the ice as well as the response of the\n8\n\n\fPMT.\n3.3 Detector Simulation\nThe response of the entire array of PMTs is modeled with the detector simulation amasim [40,41]. The actual number of photons at an OM is found by\nsampling from a Poisson distribution with a mean amplitude computed by\nsumming over all contributing muons and cascades. The arrival times of these\nphotons are sampled from the pre-tabulated distributions. Noise photons are\nadded assuming a PMT noise rate of 500 Hz. For the trigger we use a local\ncoincidence filter, requiring 5 local coincidences within a time window of 7 \u03bcs,\nwhere a local coincidence is defined as the registration of at least two signals\nin two or more PMTs within a group of five neighboring OMs on a string.\nThe detector geometry used in this simulation differs from the finalized design\nin the total number of strings (we have simulated a 75 string detector instead\nof 80), the total number of OMs (4575 instead of 4800), the string length\n(960 m instead of 1000 m) and the location of the detector center (which was\nsimulated at 2000 m, while it will lie at 1800 m depth in the updated design).\nThe spatial arrangement of the strings in a 125 m spaced triangular grid is in\naccordance to what is presented in the previous section.\n3.4 Event Reconstruction\nThe triggered events are first filtered based on three fast \"first guess\" algorithms which use the arrival times of the photons or the topology of OMs\nhaving registered a photon signal (or \"hit\"): (1) The line fit (LF ) is based\non a simple analytic \u03c72 minimization [42]. It fits the free parameters (vertex position and velocity) of a hypothetical straight line trajectory to the\none-dimensional projection of an observed pattern of hits. (2) The dipole approximation [43] is based on the hit topology: The sum of all unit vectors\n~ . The\npointing from one hit to the next in time gives a \"dipole vector\" M\n~\ndirection of M is correlated to the direction of the incoming track(s), while\nits absolute value is a measure of the goodness of the approximation. (3) The\ndirect walk algorithm (DW ) [43] posits as track hypotheses the straight line\nconnections between every two hits that have occurred in separate OMs with\na time difference consistent with muon flight time between these two OMs.\nThose track hypotheses that pass a consistency check with respect to the complete hit pattern of the event are combined to obtain an estimate of the track\nparameters.\nFollowing this first guess methods, the events are reconstructed using a full\n9\n\n\fmaximum likelihood reconstruction (LR) [43,44]. The probabilities in the likelihood function follow the arrival time distribution of photons emitted along a\ntrack as a function of distance and angle of the track with respect to the OM.\nThese distributions have been obtained from a photon propagation simulation.\nThe reconstruction used here relies on the information carried by the first\nphoton that arrives at the PMT. This corresponds to the original AMANDA\nread-out that only yields the timing information of the PMT pulses. 1\n\n4\n\nBasic Performance Capabilities\n\nThe detector trigger rate for a five-fold local coincidence trigger was found\nto be 1.7 kHz. This includes a 50 Hz rate of triggers due to non-correlated\ntime-coincident air-showers (Atm \u03bcdouble ). As described below, a basic set of\nstandard event selection criteria was established that remove the bulk of the\ndown-going CR induced muons, but still yield a large passing rate for muons\nfrom atmospheric neutrinos. These atmospheric neutrinos would then form\nthe background to searches for cosmic neutrinos. We use this level of data\nreduction as a baseline performance measure.\n4.1 Event Selection\nThe most vital criteria to reject the background of downgoing CR induced\nmuons are the zenith angles obtained from various reconstruction and filter\nalgorithms (\u0398LR , \u0398LF , \u0398DW and \u0398M~ ). The easiest way to reject CR muons\nwould be to select exclusively up-going tracks. However, muons from PeV\nor EeV neutrino interactions are expected to arrive from directions close to\nor above the horizon, so it is worthwhile to combine the angular cut with\nan energy criterion. If the neutrino interaction does not occur far from the\ndetector, the energy deposit of the daughter muon will be high enough to\ndistinguish it from low energy CR muons. An estimator of this energy deposit\nis the number of OMs (or \"channels\") that have registered a hit. We therefore\naccept downgoing tracks provided the channel multiplicity (Nch ) of the event\nis sufficiently large.\nThe individual selection criteria are listed in table 1. The first three criteria are\nbased on the track directions obtained from the three \"first guess\" methods\n1\n\nIn contrast, the IceCube electronics will retain the full pulse shape. Detailed hit\ninformation can be extracted from the integrated charge and the peak structure of\nthe pulse. Future reconstructions will therefore profit from the additional information formed by consecutively arriving photons which were multiple-scattered and\ndelayed on their way from the muon track to the PMT.\n\n10\n\n\fand aim at the early rejection of low energy downgoing CR muons. The level\nof data reduction achieved with the application of cuts 1\u20133 will be referred to\nas \"level 1\".\n\"Level 2\", defined by cuts 4\u20139, is based on the observables of the more accurate\n(and more CPU intensive) likelihood reconstruction:\n\u2022 Events that are reconstructed with zenith angles smaller than 85\u25e6 (i.e. directions more than five degrees above the horizon) are rejected, as long as\nNch is smaller than 150. The Nch -criterion is tightened with decreasing\nzenith angle (\u0398LR ) [cut 4].\nApart from the direction criterion, the likelihood reconstruction provides a\nseries of quality parameters, which we apply in order to select a sample of\nhigh quality and well reconstructed events:\n\u2022 We require the reduced likelihood (L) of the likelihood reconstruction to be\nsufficiently small. L is given by the negative logarithm of the likelihood of\nthe best-fit track hypothesis divided by the number of degrees of freedom\nof the fit, hence a small value indicates a good track quality [cut 5].\n\u2022 We require a minimum number of direct hits (Ndirect ), i.e. hits that have\noccurred with a sufficiently small delay (< 150 ns) relative to the arrival\ntime predicted for an unscattered Cherenkov photon emitted from the reconstructed track [cut 6].\n\u2022 We require a minimum track length (L), i.e. a minimum distance along the\nreconstructed track over which the hits were detected. We define this length\nas the maximum distance of two hit positions projected on the straight line\ndefining the track direction. A more stringent criterion is a lower bound on\nthe track length using direct hits (Ldirect ) [cut 7].\n\u2022 The consistency of the fitted track direction is checked with the smoothness\nparameter [7,43]. It is a measure of the evenness of the projection of the\nhit positions along the track, based on a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The\nsmoothness parameter can be calculated with either all hits (S), or exclusively direct hits (Sdirect ) [cut 8].\n\u2022 For high quality tracks, the various reconstruction methods are likely to\nproduce similar results close to the original (i.e. true) track. We therefore\nrequire the difference in zenith angles obtained by two different methods to\nbe small [cuts 9 and 3].\n\nThese quality criteria are particularly important for muons that travel a short\npath through the instrumented detection volume, e.g. low energy muons or\nmuons that pass only through the outer rim of the detector or even outside\nits geometrical volume. These muons will cause signals in fewer OMs and\ntherefore leave less information for the reconstruction. Most of the quality\n11\n\n\fTable 1\nDefinition of cuts levels.\nParameter\n\nCut\n\nExplanation\n\nLevel 1:\n1.\n\n\u0398LF\n\n> 60\u25e6 if Nch < 50\n\nzenith angle criterion\nbased on LF , applied for\nlow multiplicity events\n\n2.\n\n\u0398M\n~\n\n~ | > 0.2\n> 50\u25e6 if |M\n\nzenith angle criterion\n~ , applied for\nbased on M\nhigh goodness-of-fit values\n\n3.\n\n|\u0398DW \u2212 \u0398M\n~|\n\n< 50\u25e6\n\nconsistency of LF and DW\n\nLevel 2:\n4.\n\n\u0398LR\nNch\n\n> 85\u25e6\nor\n> 150 + 250 \u2217 cos(\u0398LR )\n\nzenith angle criterion of LR\nwhich is weakened with\nincreasing channel multiplicity\n\n5.\n\nL\n\n< 10\n\n6.\n\nNdirect\n\n> 10 if Nch < 50\n\n7.\n\nL\n\n> 300 m\nand\n> 300 m if Nch < 150\n\nrequirement of minimum track\nlength, using direct hits for\nmultiplicities smaller than 150\n\n|Sdirect |\n\n< 0.5\nand\n< 0.5 if Nch < 50\n\nconstancy of light output along\nthe track, requirement is\ntightened for low multiplicities\n\n|\u0398LF \u2212 \u0398LR |\n\n< 10\u25e6 if Nch < 150\n\nLdirect\n8.\n\n9.\n\n|S|\n\nreduced likelihood of LR\nrequirement of 10 direct hits\nfor low multiplicity events\n\nconsistency of LF and LR\n\ncriteria are therefore tightened if the channel multiplicity (Nch ) observed in\nthe event is small.\n\n4.2 Muon Detection Rates\nWe compare the detector response as well as the event selection efficiency\nfor all types of events: CR muons, muons induced by atmospheric neutrinos\nand muons from cosmic neutrinos with a hard energy spectrum, following an\nE \u22122 power law.

The expectation for atmospheric neutrino events is listed separately for the \"conventional\"\ncomponent and the \"prompt\" component (following [36](TIG) and [35](rqpm)). The\nfraction of prompt charm events with respect to the whole atmospheric neutrino\nsample is given in parentheses. The numbers of cosmic ray muon background events\nare shown separately for events that contain muon(s) from only one air shower (Atm\n\u03bc single ) and those that contain muons from two accidentally coinciding air showers\n(Atm \u03bc double ).

At this\nstage, both the background from atmospheric neutrinos and the background\nfrom CR muons yield roughly 105 events per year. The rqpm model for atmospheric charm predicts a contribution of almost 5000 prompt charm events\nto the atmospheric background. The TIG model predicts thirty times fewer\nevents.\nFigure 2 shows the zenith angle distribution for the reconstructed zenith angle\n\u0398LR of the four different event classes (Cosmic \u03bd, Atm \u03bd, Atm \u03bcsingle and\nAtm \u03bcdouble ) at different cut levels. The level 1 selection removes the bulk\nof low energy down-going CR-induced background. The angular cut on the\nzenith angles of the \"first-guess\" methods is still soft, so that most of the\nremaining background is located in the region around 30\u25e6 above the horizon.\nLevel 2 then restricts the allowed zenith region to 5\u25e6 above the horizon, except\nfor very bright, high multiplicity events. The remaining ordinary CR muon\nbackground (Atm \u03bcsingle ) at level 2 is then concentrated at the horizon and\ncould be rejected with a tightened cut on the zenith angle, while the sample\nof CR-induced background composed of two air-showers (Atm \u03bcdouble ) still\ncontains misreconstructed events that \"fake\" an upward track. However, filter\nlevel 2 does not contain a definite energy selection yet, required to separate\nthe high energy signal of cosmic neutrinos from the atmospheric neutrino\nbackground. In the simplest approach this energy selection is an additional\ntight cut on the channel multiplicity. This final cut has to be optimized for\n13\n\n\f10\n\n6\n5\n\n10\n\n4\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n2\n\nE \u03bd\n\nEvents / Year\n\nEvents / Year\n\n10\n\n-2\n\nTrigger\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\n\n10\n\n10\n\n6\n\n10\n\n5\n\n10\n\n4\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n2\n\nAtm \u03bd\n\n10\n\n1\n\n1\n-1\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n10\n-2\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n10\n-1 -0.8 -0.6 -0.4 -0.2\n\n0\n\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8\n\n1\n\n-1 -0.8 -0.6 -0.4 -0.2\n\n0\n\n12\n\n10\n\n11\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n9\n\n10\n\n8\n\n10\n\n7\n\n10\n\n6\n\n10\n\n5\n\n10\n\nEvents / Year\n\nEvents / Year\n\n10\n\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8\n\n1\n\ncos (\u0398LR)\n\ncos (\u0398LR)\n\nAtm \u03bc single\n\n10\n\n12\n\n10\n\n11\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n9\n\n10\n\n8\n\n10\n\n7\n\n10\n\n6\n\n10\n\n5\n\n4\n\n10\n\n4\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\nAtm \u03bc double\n\n10\n\n1\n\n1\n-1 -0.8 -0.6 -0.4 -0.2\n\n0\n\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8\n\n1\n\n-1 -0.8 -0.6 -0.4 -0.2\n\ncos (\u0398LR)\n\n0\n\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8\n\n1\n\ncos (\u0398LR)\n\nFig. 2.

Effective area as a function of the zenith angle after applying level 2 cuts\n(left) and as a function of the muon energy for different cut levels as described in\nthe text (right). The zenith dependence is shown separately for different intervals of\nE\u03bc . The energy dependence holds for muons for which cos \u0398\u03bc < 0, i.e. muons that\narrive from the northern sky. Energy cuts adjusted to signal spectra following E \u22122\nand E \u22122.5 power laws change the energy threshold.\n\n4.3 Effective Detector Area\nAs a measure of the detector efficiency we use the effective detector area,\ndefined as\nNdetected (E\u03bc , \u0398\u03bc )\n\u00d7 Agen ,\n(1)\nAeff (E\u03bc , \u0398\u03bc ) =\nNgenerated (E\u03bc , \u0398\u03bc )\nwhere Ngenerated is the number of muons in the test sample that have an energy\nE\u03bc at a given point within the fiducial volume and an incident zenith angle \u0398\u03bc .\nIn the following we give E\u03bc at the point of closest approach to the detector\ncenter (which might lie outside the geometrical detector volume). Ndetected\nis the number of events that trigger the detector or pass the cut level under\nconsideration. The fraction of generated to triggered or selected events is scaled\nwith the size of the generation plane Agen , which is the cross-sectional area of\nthe cylinder that contains all generated muon tracks with directions parallel\nto its axis.\nThe left plot in figure 5 shows the effective area at cut level 2 as a function of\nthe zenith angle of the muon tracks. Results are shown for four separate energy\nintervals. The detector will have an effective detection area of one square\nkilometer for upward moving muons in the TeV range. Above 100 TeV the\nselection allows for a detection of downgoing neutrinos, i.e. for an observation\nof the southern hemisphere (cos \u03b8\u03bc > 0). In the PeV range the effective area\nfor downgoing muons is above 0.6 km2 , increasing towards the horizon. This\n16\n\n\fmeans that IceCube can observe a large part of our Galaxy, including the\nGalactic center.\nThe right plot in figure 5 shows the effective area as a function of the muon\nenergy at closest approach to the detector center. Here, the effective area was\ncalculated using a sample of muons which arrive from the lower hemisphere,\ni.e. using tracks with incident zenith angles larger than 90o (or cos \u03b8\u03bc < 0, accordingly). In that sense the numbers indicate average values for the northern\nhemisphere. At trigger level the detector shows a sizeable acceptance even for\nlow energy events.\nThe effective trigger area reaches one square kilometer at a few hundred GeV.\nRoughly 50% of all triggered events pass the \"standard selection\" (level 2),\nindependent of the muon energy. Best sensitivities to extraterrestrial neutrinos are obtained by increasing the energy threshold by additional cuts on the\nmuon energy. The optimal threshold, i.e. the threshold where optimal sensitivity to one particular signal is achieved, is determined by the signal shape.\nFor instance, a hard signal spectrum like E \u22122 would suggest a tighter cut than\na softer spectrum falling like E \u22122.5 . In order to show this effect the effective\narea was calculated after applying different energy cuts. In addition to trigger\nlevel and level 2, figure 5 shows the effective area after applying additional energy cuts optimized for probing hypothetical point sources with signal spectra\nfollowing E \u22122 and E \u22122.5 (see section 5.3).\n\n4.4 Angular resolution\n\nThe angular resolution of the detector is an important quantity for the search\nfor neutrinos from point sources. A good angular resolution allows for a small\nsearch bin, resulting in a low background rate per bin. We characterize the angular resolution by the median of the distribution of the space angles between\nthe true and reconstructed directions of the simulated muon tracks.\nThe angular resolution after applying level 2 cuts is shown in figure 6 as a\nfunction of the zenith angle of the muon tracks. In the energy region from\n100 GeV to 1 TeV the pointing resolution approaches 1\u25e6 for tracks with zenith\nangles smaller than 140\u25e6 . For nearly vertical tracks of low energy muons the\nangular resolution is worse, because these events are likely to cause hits in\noptical modules of only a single string. However, the reconstruction accuracy\nin this energy range is similar to the mean angle between the muon and the\ninitial neutrino. In the most promising energy range, the region at few TeV\nand above, the resolution is substantially improved. Also, the zenith angle\ndependency of the pointing resolution weakens towards higher energies. Most\nof the signal in the TeV \u2013 PeV region will be reconstructed with an accuracy\n17\n\n\fsignificantly better than 1\u25e6 . Current reconstruction methods achieve a resolution close to 0.5\u25e6 for events near the horizon. However, we expect significant\nimprovement of the pointing resolution with further development of the reconstruction, in particular from including amplitude and waveform information.\n\n18\n\n\fo\n\nMedian( \u03b4\u03a8) /\n\n2.5\n\n100GeV \u2212 1TeV\n1 \u2212 10 TeV\n2\n\n100TeV \u2212 1 PeV\n\n1.5\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\u22121\n\n\u22120.75\n\n\u22120.5\n\n\u22120.25\n\n0\n\n0.25\n\n0.5\n\n0.75\n\n1\n\ncos( \u0398 \u03bc)\n\nFig. 6.

The median was calculated for an energy spectrum\n\u221d E \u22122 and after applying level 2 cuts.\n\n5\n\nSensitivity to Astrophysical Sources of Muon Neutrinos\n\nIn most theoretical models, the production of high energy CR is accompanied by the production of mesons. Prominent candidates for CR sources are\nputative cosmic accelerators like active galactic nuclei (AGN), microquasars,\nsupernova remnants and gamma ray bursts (GRBs). Theoretical models for\nsuch objects usually involve shock acceleration of protons. The protons interact\nwith ambient matter or radiation fields producing mesons that subsequently\ndecay into neutrinos. The spectral distribution of neutrinos expected from\ncosmic accelerators is dN\u03bd /dE\u03bd \u221d E\u03bd\u22122 , or even harder, depending on the predominant meson production mechanism in the source and on full particulars\nof the acceleration.\nThe sum of all cosmic accelerators in the universe should produce an isotropic\nflux of high energy neutrinos, which would be observable as an excess above the\ndiffuse flux of atmospheric neutrinos. The absolute flux of individual sources\nmay be small, and requires a careful selection, if one wants to resolve it.\nHowever, in this case, one can strongly suppress background, because the\nnumber of background events will be reduced with the size of the spatial search\nbin or \u2013 in case of transient phenomena \u2013 the duration of the observation time\nwindow.\n19\n\n\fIn the following we calculate the sensitivity for diffuse fluxes of cosmic muon\nneutrinos as well as for fluxes from individual point sources, both steady and\ntransient (GRBs). In contrast to former analyses, which were based on simple\nassumptions on the detector effective area as well as on its energy resolution\n[22,23,24], the method we apply involves exclusively event observables that\nwill be available from real data taken by IceCube.\n\n5.1 Calculation of the Sensitivity\nWe explore the sensitivity of the IceCube detector to cosmic neutrino fluxes\nin two ways. First we consider the limits that would be placed on models of\nneutrino production if no events were to be seen above those expected from\natmospheric neutrinos. Second, we evaluate the level of source flux required\nto observe an excess at a given significance level.\n\n5.1.1 Limit setting potential\nFeldman and Cousins have proposed a method to quantify the \"sensitivity\" of\nan experiment independently of experimental data by calculating the average\nupper limit \u03bc\u0304 that would be obtained in absence of a signal [45]. It is calculated\nfrom the mean number of expected background events, hnb i, by averaging\nover all limits obtained from all possible experimental outcomes. The average\nupper limit is the maximum number of events that can be excluded at a given\nconfidence level. That is, the experiment can be expected to constrain any\nhypothetical signal that predicts at least hns i = \u03bc\u0304 signal events.\nFrom the 90% c.l. average upper limit, we define the \"model rejection factor\"\n(mrf) for an arbitrary source spectrum \u03a6s predicting hns i signal events, as the\nratio of the average upper limit to the expected signal [24]. The average flux\nlimit \u03a690 is found by scaling the normalization of the flux model \u03a6s such that\nthe number of expected events equals the average upper limit\n\n\u03a690 = \u03a6s \u00d7\n\n\u03bc\u030490\n\u2261 \u03a6s \u00d7 mrf.\nhns i\n\n(2)\n\n5.1.2 Discovery potential\nFor our purposes, a phenomenon is considered \"discovered\" when a measurement yields an excess of 5-sigma over background, meaning that the probability of the observation being due to an upward fluctuation of background\nis less than 2.85 \u00d7 10\u22127, being the the integral of the one-sided tail beyond\n20\n\n\f5-sigma of a normalized Gaussian. From the background expectation hnb i, we\ncan determine the minimum number of events n0 to be observed to produce\nthe required significance as\n\u221e\nX\n\nP (nobs | hnb i) \u2264 2.85 * 10\u22127,\n\n(3)\n\nnobs =n0\n\nwhere P (nobs |hnb i) is the Poisson probability for observing nobs background\nevents. The minimum detectable flux \u03a65\u03c3 for any source model can then be\nfound by scaling the model flux \u03a6s such that hns i + hnb i = n0 .\nIf a real signal source of average strength \u03a65\u03c3 is present, the probability of the\ncombination of signal and background producing an observation sufficient to\ngive the required significance (i.e. an observation of n0 events or greater) is\n\nP5\u03c3 =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nP (nobs | hns i + hnb i).\n\n(4)\n\nnobs =n0\n\nThus we cannot say that an underlying signal strength will always produce\nan observation with 5-sigma significance, but we can find the signal strength\nsuch that the probability of P5\u03c3 is close to certainty e.g. 70%, 90% or 99%.\n\n5.2 Diffuse Flux Sensitivity\nMany models have been developed that predict a diffuse neutrino flux to be\nexpected from the sum of all active galaxies in the universe. First we will\nconsider the potential of IceCube to both place a limit on, and detect, a\ngeneric diffuse flux following an E \u22122 spectrum. After looking in detail at this\ncase we summarize the capabilities of the detector to place limits on a few\nparticipating models with spectral shapes different from E \u22122 .\nWe use the simplest observable, the multiplicity Nch of hit channels per event\nas an energy separation cut, in order to reject the steep spectrum of events\ninduced by atmospheric neutrinos, and retain the events from the harder extraterrestrial diffuse spectrum. 2 The correlation between the muon energy at\nclosest approach to the detector center and channel multiplicity is shown in\nthe left plot of figure 7. The right plot shows the Nch distributions for an E \u22122\nsignal compared to the atmospheric background.\n2\n\nAn improved energy separation is expected from the use of a more sophisticated\nenergy reconstruction using individual hit amplitude and/or the full waveform information\n\n21\n\n\fEvents / Year\n\n< Nch >\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n10\n\n5\n\n10\n\n4\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n2\n\nE \u03bd\n-2\n\nAtm \u03bd\n\n10\n\n1\n-1\n\n1\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n10\n\n8\n\n0\n\nlog10 (E\u03bc / GeV)\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\nNch\n\n10\n\n6\n\n10\n\n5\n\nmrf\n\nIntegrated Number of Events\n\nFig. 7.

For each\npossible cut value we compute the mrf from the number of remaining signal\nand background events. The cut is placed, where the mrf is minimized.\nThis procedure is illustrated in figure 8: The left plot shows the integrated\nmultiplicity distribution for signal and background, together with the average\n22\n\n\f4\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n2\n\nE \u03bd\n\nEvents / Year\n\nEvents / Year\n\n10\n\n-2\n\nLevel 2\nNch > 227\n\n10\n\n4\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n10\n\n1\n\n1\n\n-1\n\nAtm \u03bd\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n10\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\nlog10(E\u03bd / GeV)\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\nlog10(E\u03bd / GeV)\n\nFig. 9. Energy spectra of selected neutrinos for a E \u22122 source (left) and atmospheric neutrinos (right). The selection is given by level 2 cuts (dotted lines)\nand application of the optimized cut Nch > 227 (full lines). The cutoff in the signal\nspectrum at 108 GeV is due to the limited energy range of simulation.\n\nupper limit \u03bc\u030490 . The right plot shows the mrf as a function of the Nch -cut.\nThe mrf reaches its minimum of 8.1 \u00d7 10\u22122 at Nch =227, corresponding to an\noverall flux limit of E\u03bd2 \u00d7 dN\u03bd /dE\u03bd = 8.1 \u00d7 10\u22129 cm\u22122 s\u22121 sr\u22121 GeV. This flux\nlimit applies for the flux of extraterrestrial muon-neutrinos to be measured at\nthe Earth. In the presence of neutrino oscillations, the constraint on the flux\nescaping cosmic sources must be modified accordingly: For maximal mixing\n[46,47] between muon- and tau-neutrinos during propagation to the Earth,\none would expect the flux of muon neutrinos at the Earth to be half as large\nas the flux at the source. So the limit on the muon neutrino flux produced in\ncosmic sources is higher by a factor of two. In the following \"cosmic neutrino\nflux\" refers to the intensity of muon neutrinos measured at the Earth.\nThe simulated cosmic neutrino flux of E\u03bd2 \u00d7dN\u03bd /dE\u03bd = 1\u00d710\u22127 cm\u22122 s\u22121 sr\u22121 GeV\nyields 74 signal events passing the optimized cut, compared to 8 background\nevents from atmospheric neutrinos. The background expectation was calculated using the rqpm model for the prompt charm contribution, according to\nwhich prompt charm decays account for 80% of the remaining atmospheric\nneutrinos. The prediction according to the TIG model would result in an improvement of the average flux limit by roughly a factor of two.\nThe energy spectra of the incident signal and background neutrinos are shown\nin figure 9. The final cut, as it is placed here, results in a detection threshold\nof about 100 TeV. This threshold is the result of an optimization to one particular signal hypothesis, an E \u22122 neutrino spectrum extending up to energies\nof 108 GeV. The artificial cutoff in the signal spectrum at 108 GeV (where the\nsimulation ends) neglects additional events above this energy. Without the\nartifical cutoff one would get a slightly improved limit.\n23\n\n\f\u22121\n\nGeV ]\n\nP(5 \u03c3) = 99 %\nP(5 \u03c3) = 90 %\nP(5\u03c3) = 70 %\n\n3.5\n\n2.5\n\n\u22121\n\ncm\n\n\u22122\n\nsr\n\n3\n\n1.5\n\nE \u2217dN \u03bd /dE \u03bd [10\n\n\u22128\n\ns\n\n2\n\n1\n\n2\n\n0.5\n\n90 % C.L.

Sensitivity to diffuse neutrino fluxes: Improvement with time.\n\nThe sensitivity obtained after one year of data taking is already well below the\ndiffuse bound calculated by Waxman and Bahcall [48]. (This limit holds for\noptically thin CR sources, under the assumption that these sources produce\nthe observed flux of high energy CR.) A flux at the level E\u03bd2 \u00d7dN\u03bd /dE\u03bd = 2.4\u00d7\n10\u22128 cm\u22122 s\u22121 sr\u22121 GeV is needed for a 5-sigma observation after a period of one\nyear. This flux is 40 times below the present best established 90% c.l. upper\nlimit [9]. The improvement with time of the exclusion and discovery potential\nof the detector is summarized in table 3. As the exposure time increases, the\noptimal multiplicity cut becomes tighter, resulting in a better separation of\nsignal and background. After data is taken over five years, the sensitivity is\nimproved by a factor of about 2.5. The 5-sigma detection level given in table 3\ncorresponds to the flux, for which the event rate from signal plus background\nexceeds the 5-sigma threshold. The signal strength at which the 5-sigma excess\nis produced at a fixed probability, is shown in figure 10 as a function of time.\nA signal of E\u03bd2 \u00d7 dE\u03bd /dN\u03bd = 1 \u00d7 10\u22128 cm\u22122 s\u22121 sr\u22121 GeV, for instance, would be\ndetected with a probability of 70 % after five years of datataking.\nApart from the generic case of an E \u22122 spectrum, which is typical for scenarios\nthat involve meson production in interactions of shock accelerated CR with\nmatter, we have varied the signal slope towards flatter spectra. Such spectra\nwould be expected from environments where CR predominantly interact on\nphoton fields, e.g. AGN jets [49]. The average differential limits for an assumed\nobservation period of three years are listed in table 4.\nMannheim, Protheroe and Rachen have calculated an upper bound on the\ndiffuse neutrino flux arising from photo-hadronic interactions in unresolved\nAGN jets in the universe.

We have determined the model rejection potential for this particular\nshape (and for energies below 108 GeV) to be mrf = 1.9 * 10\u22122, meaning that\nIceCube will be sensitive to fluxes of similar shape, but fifty times smaller\nthan the MPR maximum model.\nFinally, we have selected one particular model by Stecker and Salamon [50] for\nneutrinos from proton interactions on the UV thermal photon field in AGN\n25\n\n\fTable 4\nSensitivity to diffuse neutrino fluxes of various shapes.

The ability of the detector to reconstruct muon tracks to\nwithin 1\u25e6 of their true direction allows a search window to be used that greatly\nreduces the background, while retaining a large fraction of the signal. This\nallows for a loosening of the energy separation cut.\nWe restrict this analysis to the case of a point source search for candidate\nsources in the northern sky. That is, we do not simulate a cluster or grid search,\nbut we consider the case where an angular search bin is fixed by the direction\nof the candidate source under test. In reality the sensitivity will depend on the\ndeclination of the source location. For simplicity of presentation we calculate\naveraged event rates for all declinations throughout the northern sky.\nWe use an angular search cone of 1\u25e6 centered about the direction of a hypothetical point source. After application of the standard cut selection, we\noptimize the Nch -cut with respect to the model rejection potential for a point\nsource following an E \u22122 spectrum. A cut at a channel multiplicity of Nch =30,\ncombined with the angle cut of one degree, leads to the best average flux upper limit of E\u03bd2 \u00d7 dN\u03bd /dE\u03bd = 5.5 \u00d7 10\u22129 cm\u22122 s\u22121 GeV after one year of data\ntaking. A flux three times greater, will on average, produce a 5-sigma signal.\nTable 5 and figure 12 summarize the improvement of the limit with increased\nexposure time. After three years of operation IceCube can be expected to\nplace flux limits on potential sources at a level E\u03bd2 \u00d7 dN\u03bd /dE\u03bd \u223c 2.4 \u00d7\n10\u22129 cm\u22122 s\u22121 GeV, while the discovery probability for a flux three times stronger\n26\n\n\fTable 5\nSensitivity to point sources.

Sensitivity to point-like neutrino emission: Improvement with time.\n\nFigure 13 shows the energy spectra of both the remaining signal events and\nthe remaining events from the atmospheric neutrino background after applying\nstandard cuts and after cutting at Nch > 30. This cut results in an effective\nenergy threshold of 1 TeV. Since most of the signal is in the TeV region, the\nenergy cut-off of the Monte Carlo simulation has negligible impact on the\nresult. Above results are valid for the rqpm prediction for prompt neutrinos.\nUsing the TIG model improves the sensitivity by about 2 %.\nAs for the diffuse signal, we have tested different exponential slopes for the\nsignal hypothesis.

The coexistence of nucleons and photons in the fireball\nmay result in the production of neutrinos.\nWaxman and Bahcall [48] calculated the expected flux of neutrinos from the\nsum of all GRBs by assuming that they are the source of the observed flux\nof cosmic rays. The Waxman-Bahcall model results in a broken power-law\n28\n\n\fneutrino spectrum given by\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\nA\nE\u03bd < E\u03bdb1\ndN\u03bd\nb1 ,\n= E\u03bd E\u03bd\n\uf8f4 A\ndE\u03bd\n\uf8f3\n, E\u03bdb1 < E\u03bd < E\u03bdb2 ,\nE2\n\n(5)\n\n\u03bd\n\nwhere the break energy E\u03bdb1 lies at \u223c 105 GeV. Above E\u03bdb2 = 107 GeV the\nspectrum steepens again by one power in energy. With a full sky GRB rate\nof \u223c1000 per year, as assumed by Waxman and Bahcall, the normalization\nconstant in equation 5 would amount to A \u223c 3 \u00d7 10\u22129 cm\u22122 s\u22121 sr\u22121 GeV. 3\nThis neutrino flux is shown in figure 11 labeled GRB. It appears to be below\nthe diffuse flux sensitivity level of IceCube. However, the search for neutrinos accompanying a GRB is essentially background-free, because one looks\nfor neutrino events that are coincident in direction and time to the satellite\nobservation.\nThe search for neutrinos from GRBs involves summing over the observation\ntime and spatial search windows for many separate bursts. For this analysis\nwe have used a hypothetical observation duration of 10 seconds and a spatial search cone of 10\u25e6 centered about the direction of each GRB. We have\nonly considered events in the northern sky, where we can be sure that the\nsearch will not be limited by downgoing CR muon background. From 500\nbursts in 2\u03c0 sr we would expect 13 neutrino-induced up-going muons per year\nafter applying standard level 2 quality cuts (table 1). The background of atmospheric neutrinos is strongly reduced by the spatial and temporal coincidence\nrequirements. With almost full retention of the signal, the atmospheric neutrino background expectation is reduced to roughly 0.1 event. The smallness\nof the background expectation allows one to exclude signals of mean intensity\nhns i = \u03bc\u030490 = 2.5 events per year at 90% classical confidence, meaning that the\nexperiment will be sensitive to a neutrino flux roughly five times smaller than\nthe flux calculated by Waxman and Bahcall (equation 5). This also means\nthat the observation of 100 bursts would suffice to exclude the Waxman and\nBahcall model. A 5-sigma detection would require the observation of n0 = 5\nevents, which corresponds to the mean number of events expected from 203\nbursts. In this case the probability to actually observe a 5-sigma excess is\nabout 58%. With 500 bursts this probability climbs to 99%. The time period\nafter which we can expect a detection depends on the efficiency of the gamma\nray observations, since the search strategy requires the GRBs to be triggered\nby satellites. Assuming that future gamma ray observations will provide a few\nhundred triggered burst per year, we can conclude that IceCube has excellent\nprospects to reveal the neutrino signal possibly emerging from GRBs within\na very short time: The analysis of data taken over one year would presumably suffice to yield a 5-sigma signal (provided the model by Waxman and\n3\n\nA more recent calculation yielded a normalization constant which is about three\ntimes larger [51].\n\n29\n\n\fBahcall predicts neutrino fluxes at the right scale). Moreover, the sensitivity\ngiven above is obtained when employing the most conservative search strategy, namely searching only one hemisphere for the signal of up-going neutrinos.\nHowever, one can be convinced that the drastic background reduction due to\nthe small observation time window will result in a sizable acceptance also for\ndownward signal.\n\n5.5 Systematic Uncertainties and Possible Improvements\n\nThe present systematic uncertainty of the given flux limits is dominated by\nthree components. The largest is the uncertainty in the angular dependence\nof the OM sensitivity, including the effect of the refrozen ice around the OM.\nA local increase in light scattering from air bubbles trapped in the vicinity of\nthe OM translates into a modulation of its angle-dependent acceptance. This\ncomponent is followed in size by uncertainties in the absolute OM sensitivity and in the optical properties of the bulk ice. For the comparatively small\nAMANDA-B10 array the inclusion of all components of uncertainty weakens\nthe point source flux limit by 25% compared to standard simulation values\n[52]. The variation of some of these parameters in simulations of the larger\nAMANDA-II array and for IceCube indicates that for larger arrays the systematic uncertainties of the basic input parameters become less important,\nwith the exception of muon energies close to the detection threshold. For instance, increasing the absolute OM sensitivity in IceCube by a factor of 2\nresults in a 25 (10) % larger effective area at 1 (10) TeV. Taking into account\nthat uncertainties in limits depend more weakly than linearly on uncertainties\nin effective area [52], we estimate the overall uncertainties of the E \u22122 limits\nderived above to be at most 20%.\nOn the other hand, we may expect that improved detector properties for IceCube as compared to AMANDA will result in smaller systematic uncertainties\nand a better performance. First, the use of glass spheres and PMT glass with\nbetter UV transparency or, alternatively, a covering of the glass spheres with\nwavelength shifter, will enhance the OM sensitivity in the UV region and result\nin a better light collection. This will particularly increase the sensitivity and\nangular resolution at low energies. Information obtained from the full waveform will improve both the angular resolution and the energy reconstruction\nat high energies. Waveform information will be used in AMANDA from 2003\non, and methods to make efficient use of the corresponding information are\nunder development. Finally, the information from the IceTop surface array will\nenhance the rejection power with respect to downward moving atmospheric\nmuons. This method, unique to IceCube, is expected to be particularly helpful for muons from coincident, independent air showers and would allow a\nloosening other rejection criteria, thereby enhancing the signal efficiency.\n30\n\n\f6\n\nSummary\n\nWe have described the performance of the IceCube detector in searching for\nmuons from extraterrestrial neutrinos in the TeV-PeV energy range.\nA Monte Carlo simulation of a realistic model detector was used to assess\nthe sensitivity of the experiment. We have simulated both neutrino-induced\nmuons and muons produced from cosmic-ray interactions in the atmosphere\nwith sufficient statistics to establish event selection criteria and infer event\nrates to be expected from each event class. The trigger rate due to down-going\nmuons produced in the atmosphere was found to be 1.7 kHz including a 50 Hz\nrate due to non-correlated air-showers that produce time-coincident muons\nwithin the detector. Muons induced by atmospheric neutrinos are expected to\ncause about 0.8 million triggers per year. A benchmark flux of E\u03bd2 \u00d7dN\u03bd /dE\u03bd =\n10\u22127 cm\u22122 s\u22121 sr\u22121 GeV for the diffuse signal of astrophysical neutrinos results\nin 3300 triggers per year. Roughly a third of them pass quality cuts which at\nthe same time reduce the background rate from misreconstructed downward\nmuon tracks to the level of well reconstructed upward muons from atmospheric\nneutrinos.\nIn order to quantify the detector acceptance, we have computed the effective\ndetector area. After applying a set of standard quality criteria, the effective\narea exceeds one square kilometer for upward-going muons with energies of\n10 TeV and above. At this stage, 50 % of all muons of this energy will be\nreconstructed with an accuracy of 0.8\u25e6 or better. For energies above 100 TeV,\nthe angular acceptance with respect to well identified extraterrestrial neutrinos\nextends above the horizon and the effective area reaches 0.6 km2 for downgoing\nmuons in the PeV range. This means that at high energies IceCube can observe\na large part of the Galaxy, including the galactic center.\nIn order to quantify the sensitivity to fluxes of astrophysical neutrinos, we\nhave determined the flux normalization for a generic E \u22122 differential energy\nspectrum that correspond to a detection with 5-sigma significance, or, in\nabsence of signal, a 90 % c.l. limit. We found a diffuse source strength of\nE\u03bd2 \u00d7 dN\u03bd /dE\u03bd = 10\u22128 cm\u22122 s\u22121 sr\u22121 GeV for the 5-sigma detection level and\n4 \u00d7 10\u22129 cm\u22122 s\u22121 sr\u22121 GeV for the exclusion potential of the detector, given\nan observation time of three years. This is two orders of magnitude below\npresent experimental limits. For point-like neutrino emission we found that,\nafter three years, a flux of E\u03bd2 \u00d7 dN\u03bd /dE\u03bd = 7 \u00d7 10\u22129 cm\u22122 s\u22121 GeV would\nresult in a 5-sigma excess over background, while a flux of E\u03bd2 \u00d7 dN\u03bd /dE\u03bd =\n2 \u00d7 10\u22129 cm\u22122 s\u22121 GeV can be excluded at 90 % c.l. Both numbers are averaged\nover all declinations throughout the northern sky. Integrated over all neutrino\nenergies above 1 TeV, these fluxes transform to F\u03bd (> 1 TeV) = 7(2) \u00d7 10\u221212\ncm\u22122 s\u22121 .\n31\n\n\fWe have also calculated the potential of IceCube to detect neutrinos in coincidence with gamma ray bursts, following the model of Waxman and Bahcall.\nWe found that a 5-sigma signal is expected from the observation of about\n200 bursts, while an observation of 100 bursts would suffice to rule out the\nWaxman and Bahcall model.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThis research was supported by the following agencies: National Science Foundation\u2013\nOffice of Polar Programs, National Science Foundation\u2013Physics Division, University of Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation, USA; Swedish Research\nCouncil, Swedish Polar Research Secretariat, Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation, Sweden; German Ministry for Education and Research, Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG), Germany; Fund for Scientific Research (FNRS-FWO),\nFlanders Institute to encourage scientific and technological research in industry (IWT), Belgian Federal Office for Scientific, Technical and Cultural affairs\n(OSTC), Belgium; Inamori Sceience Foundation, Japan; FPVI, Venezuela;\nThe Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO).\n\nReferences\n[1] T.
