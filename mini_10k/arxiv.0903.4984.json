A new scheme is\nintroduced which allows an accurate resolution of this elliptic equation for an arbitrary\nanisotropy ratio.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe objective of this paper is to introduce an efficient and accurate numerical scheme to\nsolve a strongly anisotropic elliptic problem of the form\n(\n\u2212\u2207 * (A\u2207\u03c6) = f , in \u03a9\n(1)\n\u03c6 = 0 on \u2202\u03a9D , \u2202z \u03c6 = 0 on \u2202\u03a9z ,\nwhere \u03a9 \u2282 R2 or \u03a9 \u2282 R3 is a domain, with boundary \u2202\u03a9 = \u2202\u03a9D \u222a \u2202\u03a9z and the diffusion\nmatrix A is given by\n\u0012\n\u0013\nA\u22a5\n0\nA=\n.\n1\n0\n\u03b5 Az\nThe terms A\u22a5 and Az are of the same order of magnitude, whereas the parameter 0 < \u03b5 < 1\ncan be very small, provoking thus the high anisotropy of the problem. In the present paper\nthe considered anisotropy direction is fixed and is aligned with the z-axis of a Cartesian\ncoordinate system. The method presented here is extended in some forthcoming works to\nmore general anisotropies [9].\nAnisotropic problems are common in mathematical modeling and numerical simulation.\nIndeed they occur in several fields of applications such as flows in porous media [3,16], semiconductor modelling [24], quasi-neutral plasma simulations [11], image processing [28, 29],\natmospheric or oceanic flows [27], and so on, the list being not exhaustive. More specifically\nhigh anisotropy aligned with one direction may occur in shell problems or simulation in\nstretched media. The initial motivation for the present work is closely related to magnetized\nplasma simulations such as atmospheric [18, 21] or inertial fusion plasmas [7, 12] or plasma\nthrusters [1]. In this context, the medium is structured by the magnetic field. Indeed, the\n\u2020 Universit\u00e9\n\nde Toulouse, UPS, INSA, UT1, UTM, Institut de Math\u00e9matiques de Toulouse, F-31062\nToulouse, France\n\u2021 CNRS, Institut de Math\u00e9matiques de Toulouse UMR 5219, F-31062 Toulouse, France\n\u00a7 CMI/LATP, Universit\u00e9 de Provence, 39 rue Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Joliot-Curie 13453 Marseille cedex 13\n\n1\n\n\fAn asymptotic preserving scheme for strongly anisotropic elliptic problems\n\n2\n\nmotion of charged particles in planes perpendicular to the magnetic field is governed by a\nfast gyration around the magnetic field lines. This explains the large number of collisions\nthe particles encounter in the perpendicular plane, whereas the dynamic in the parallel direction is rather undisturbed. As a consequence the particle mobilities in the perpendicular\nand parallel directions differ by many orders of magnitude. In the context of ionospheric\nplasma modelling [6, 17], the ratio of the aligned and transverse mobilities (denoted in this\npaper by \u03b5\u22121 ) can be as huge as ten to the power ten. The relevant boundary conditions in\nmany fields of application are periodic (for instance in simulations of tokamak plasmas on a\ntorus) or Neumann boundary conditions (see for instance [5] for atmospheric plasmas). The\nsystem (1) is thus a good model to elaborate a robust numerical method.\nThe main difficulties with the resolution of problem (1) are of numerical nature, as solving\nthis singular perturbation problem for small 0 < \u03b5 \u226a 1 is rather delicate. Indeed, replacing\nin the anisotropic elliptic equation \u03b5 by zero, yields an ill-posed problem, which has an\ninfinite number of solutions (namely all functions which are constant in the z-direction).\nThis feature is translated in the discrete case (after the discretization of the problem) into a\nlinear system which is very ill-conditioned for \u03b5 \u226a 1, due to the different order of magnitudes\nof the various terms. As a consequence standard numerical methods for the resolution of\nlinear systems lead to important numerical costs and unacceptable numerical errors.\nMore generally, this numerical difficulty arises when the boundary conditions supplied to\nthe dominant O(1/\u03b5) operator lead to an ill-posed problem with a multiplicity of solutions.\nThis is the case for Neumann boundary conditions, but also of periodic boundary conditions.\nIf instead, the boundary conditions are such that the dominant operator gives a well-posed\nproblem with a unique solution, this difficulty vanishes as the leading operator alone will\nsuffice to completely determine the limit solution. In this case, one can resort to standard\nmethods. This is the case of Dirichlet or Robin boundary conditions. In spite of the fact that\nthe problem addressed in the present paper arises only with specific boundary conditions, it\nhas a considerable impact in many physics problem, such as plasmas, geophysical flows, plate\nand shells, etc. In this paper, we will focus on Neumann boundary conditions because they\nrepresent a larger range of physical applications, but we could address periodic boundary\nconditions in a similar way.\nNumerical methods for anisotropic elliptic problems have been extensively investigated\nin the literature. Depending on the underlying physics, distinct numerical methods are\ndeveloped. For example domain decomposition (Schur complement) and multigrid techniques, using multiple coarse grid corrections are adapted to anisotropic equations in [14,22]\nand [13,25]. For anisotropy aligned with one (or two directions), point (or plane) smoothers\nare shown to be very efficient [23]. A problem very similar to (1) is addressed in [15], treated\nvia a parametrisation technique, and seems to give good results for rather large anisotropy\nratios. However, these techniques are only developed in the context of an elliptic operator\nwith a dominant part supplemented with Dirichlet boundary conditions.\nAn alternative approach for dealing with highly anisotropic problems is based on a mathematical reformulation of the continuous problem, in order to obtain a more harmless problem, which can be solved numerically in an uncomplicated manner. In this category can\nbe situated for example asymptotic models, describing for small values of the asymptotic\nparameter \u03b5 the evolution of an approximation \u03c6\u0303 of the solution of (1) [5, 20]. However,\nthese asymptotic models are precise only for \u03b5 \u226a 1, and cannot be used on the whole range\nof values covered by the physical parameter \u03b5. Thus model coupling methods have to be\nemployed. In sub-domains where the limit model is no longer valid, the original model has\nto be used, which means that a model coupling strategy has to be developed. However the\ncoupling strategy requires the existence of an area where both models are valid and still\ndemands an accurate numerical method for the resolution of the original model (i.e. the\nanisotropic elliptic problem) with large anisotropies. This can be rather undesirable.\n\n\fAn asymptotic preserving scheme for strongly anisotropic elliptic problems\n\n3\n\nIn this paper, we present an original numerical algorithm belonging to the second approach.\nA reformulation of the continuous problem (1) will permit us to solve this problem in an\ninexpensive way and accurately enough, independently of the parameter \u03b5. This scheme\nis related to the Asymptotic Preserving numerical method introduced in [19]. These techniques are designed to provide computations in various regimes without any restriction on\nthe discretization meshes and with the additional property to converge towards the solution of the limit problem when the asymptotic parameter goes to zero. The derivation of\nsuch Asymptotic Preserving methods requires first the identification of the limit model. For\nsingular perturbation problems, a reformulation of the problem is required in order to derive a set of equations containing both the initial and the limit model with a continuous\ntransition from one regime to another, according to the values of the parameter \u03b5. This\nreformulated system of equations sets the foundation of the AP-scheme. Other singular\nperturbations have already been explored in previous studies, for instance quasi-neutral or\ngyro-fluid limits [10, 12]. These techniques have been first introduced for non-stationary\nsystems of equations, for which the time discretization must be studied with care in order\nto guarantee the asymptotic preserving property. For the anisotropic elliptic equation investigated in this article, we only need to precise the reformulated system and provide a\ndiscretization of this one.\nThe outline of this paper is the following. Section 2 of this article presents first the initial anisotropic elliptic model. In the remainder of this paper, it will be referred to as\nthe Singular-Perturbation model (P-model). The reformulated system (referred to as the\nAsymptotic Preserving formulation or AP-formulation) is then derived. It relates on a decomposition of the solution \u03c6(x, z) according to its mean part \u03c6\u0304(x) along the z coordinate\nand a fluctuation \u03c6\u2032 (x, z) consisting of a correction to the mean part needed to recover the\nfull solution. The mean part \u03c6\u0304(x) is solution of an \u03b5-independent elliptic problem, and the\nfluctuation \u03c6\u2032 (x, z) = \u03c6(x, z) \u2212 \u03c6\u0304(x) is given by a well-posed \u03b5-dependent elliptic problem.\nThe advantage is that the \u03b5-dependent problem for the fluctuation is well-posed and solvable\nin an inexpensive way, and this uniformly in \u03b5. In the limit \u03b5 \u2192 0 the AP-formulation reduces to the so called Limit model (L-model), whose solution is an acceptable approximation\nof the P-model solution for \u03b5 \u226a 1. The present derivation is carried out in the framework\nof an anisotropy aligned along one axis of a Cartesian coordinate system. In the context of\nmagnetized plasma simulations, this initial work is extended in a forthcoming work for the\nthree dimensional case in curvilinear coordinates, designed to fit a more complex magnetic\nfield topology (i.e. anisotropy direction) [6]. The main constraints of this method reside in\nthe construction of the mean part which necessitates the integration of the solution along\nthe anisotropy direction. This operation is easily carried out in the context of coordinates\nadapted with the anisotropy direction. However, an extension of the techniques presented\nhere is currently developed for non-adapted coordinates [9].\nSection 3 is devoted to the numerical implementation of the AP-formulation. Numerical results are then presented for a test case, and the three approaches (AP-formulation, straight\ndiscretization and resolution of the P-model and L-model) are compared according to the\nprecision of the approximation for different values of \u03b5. In section 4 we shall rigorously analyse the convergence of the AP-scheme. Error estimates will be established which underline\nthe advantages of the AP-scheme as compared to the initial Singular Perturbation model\nand the Limit model.\nCurrent research directions are concerned with the adaptation of the present technique\nto the case of arbitrary spatially varying anisotropies, without adaptation of the coordinate\nsystem to the direction of the anisotropy. These developments will allow the treatment on\nnonlinear problems, when the diffusion tensor (and its principal directions) depend on the\nsolution itself. This treatment will involve iterative methods which, at each iterate, will\n\n\fAn asymptotic preserving scheme for strongly anisotropic elliptic problems\n\n4\n\nreduce the problem to the solution of a linear anisotropic diffusion problem.\n\n2\n\nThe asymptotic preserving formulation\n\nFor simplicity we shall consider in this paper the two-dimensional problem, posed on a\nrectangular domain \u03a9 = \u03a9x \u00d7 \u03a9z , where \u03a9x \u2282 R and \u03a9z \u2282 R are intervals. The ideas\nexposed here can be extended without any problems to the more physical three-dimensional\ndomain, with two transverse directions (x, y) and an anisotropy direction aligned with the\nz-direction. In this section we introduce the Singular Perturbation Model, the Limit Model\nand the Asymptotic Preserving formulation.\n\n2.1\n\nThe Singular Perturbation Model (P-model)\n\nThe main concern of this paper is the numerical resolution of the following anisotropic,\nelliptic problem, called in the sequel Singular Perturbation Model\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 \u2212\u2207 * (A\u2207\u03c6) = f , in \u03a9 ,\n(2)\n(P )\n\u2202\u03c6\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n= 0 on \u03a9x \u00d7 \u2202\u03a9z ,\n\u03c6 = 0 on \u2202\u03a9x \u00d7 \u03a9z .\n\u2202z\nThe anisotropy of the media is modeled via the definition of the diffusion matrix A\n\u0012\n\u0013\nA\u22a5\n0\nA=\n,\n1\n0\n\u03b5 Az\n\n(3)\n\nwhere A\u22a5 (x, z) and Az (x, z) are given functions with comparable order of magnitudes.

Thus\nincluding this asymptotic limit property into equation (6) gives rise to the L-model (4),\nverified by the solution of the Singular Perturbation model in the limit \u03b5 \u2192 0.\n\nRemark 2.1 The L-model is the singular limit of the original P-model (2). It provides an\naccurate approximation of the P-solution only for small values of \u03b5. The P-model is valid\nfor all 0 < \u03b5 < 1, but numerically impracticable for \u03b5 \u226a 1. Indeed working with a finite\nprecision, the asymptotic model degenerates into the R-model defined by (7) as \u03b5 vanishes.\nThis R-model is ill-posed since it exhibits an infinite amount of solutions \u03c6 = \u03c6\u0303(x), depending\nonly on the variable x. This implies that the discretization matrix derived from the P-model\nis very ill-conditioned for small 0 < \u03b5 \u226a 1. This point is addressed by the numerical\nexperiments of section 3.2. Consequently, in a domain where \u03b5 varies significantly, a model\ncoupling method has to be developed in order to exploit the validity of each model, the P- and\nL-model. This can be rather undesirable. In the next section we shall present an alternative\napproach, which is based on a reformulation of the Singular-Perturbation model providing\na means of computing an accurate numerical approximation of the solution for all values\n0 < \u03b5 < 1.\nRemark 2.2 The asymptotics is totally different in the case of Dirichlet boundary conditions. In this case, the R-model is well posed, with a unique solution, and there is no\ndifficulty anymore. Any standard numerical solution of the P-model will converge to that of\nthe R-model. In other words, with Dirichlet boundary conditions, the perturbation becomes\nregular and the limit solution is fully determined by the formal limit system. The situation\nand the difficulty addressed in the present paper require that the R-model be ill-posed. This\nis the case with Neumann boundary conditions (which is the framework chosen here) but\nalso with periodic boundary conditions, or any other boundary condition which would result\nin an ill-posed R-model.\n\n2.3\n\nThe Asymptotic Preserving reformulation (AP-formulation)\n\nIn order to circumvent the just described numerical difficulties in handling the Singular\nPerturbation model, we introduce a reformulation, which permits a transition from the\ninitial P -model to its singular limit (L-model), as \u03b5 \u2192 0.\nFor this, we shall decompose each quantity f (x, z) into its mean value f \u0304(x) along the z\ncoordinate and a fluctuation part f \u2032 (x, z). For simplicity reasons let in the following \u03a9x :=\n(0, Lx ) and \u03a9z := (0, Lz ). Then\nf (x, z) = f \u0304(x) + f \u2032 (x, z) ,\n\n(8)\n\nwith\n1\nf \u0304(x) :=\nLz\n\nZ\n\nLz\n\nf (x, z)dz ,\n\n0\n\nf \u2032 (x, z) := f (x, z) \u2212 f \u0304(x) .\n\n(9)\n\nNote that we have the following properties\nf \u0304\u2032 = 0 ,\n\u2202f/\u2202z\n\n=\n\n(\u2202f/\u2202x) = \u2202f/\u2202x ,\n\u2032\n\n\u2202f /\u2202z ,\n\n\u2032\n\n(\u2202f/\u2202x)\n\n=\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2202 f /\u2202x ,\n\nf g = f \u0304\u1e21 + f \u2032 g \u2032 ,\n\u2032\n\n\u2032 \u2032\n\n(f g) = f g \u2212\n\nf \u2032g\u2032\n\n(10)\n+ f \u0304g \u2032 + f \u2032 \u1e21 .\n\n(11)\n\n\fAn asymptotic preserving scheme for strongly anisotropic elliptic problems\n\n6\n\nTaking now the mean of the elliptic equation (5) along the z-coordinate, we get thanks\nto (10) and (11), an equation for the evolution of the mean part \u03c6\u0304(x)\n\uf8f1\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2032\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 \u2212 \u2202 \u0100 \u2202 \u03c6\u0304 = f \u0304 + \u2202 A\u2032 \u2202\u03c6 , in \u03a9 ,\nx\n\u22a5\n\u22a5\n\u2202x\n\u2202x\n\u2202x\n\u2202x\n(AP 1)\n(12)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 \u03c6 = 0 on \u2202\u03a9 .\nx\nSubstracting from (5) this mean equation (12), gives rise to the evolution equation for the\nfluctuation part \u03c6\u2032 (x, z)\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\uf8f1\n\u2202\u03c6\u2032\n\u2202\u03c6\u2032\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03c6\u2032\n\uf8f4\n\u2032\n\uf8f4\nA\u22a5\nAz\n\u2212\u03b5\nA\u22a5\n+\u03b5\n=\n\u2212\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u2202z\n\u2202z\n\u2202x\n\u2202x\n\u2202x\n\u2202x\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u2202\n\uf8f2\n\u2032\n\u2032 \u2202\u03c6\n\u03b5f + \u03b5\nA\u22a5\n,\n(AP 2)\n\u2202x\n\u2202x\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4 \u2202\u03c6\u2032\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n= 0 on \u03a9x \u00d7 \u2202\u03a9z ,\n\u03c6\u2032 = 0 on \u2202\u03a9x \u00d7 \u03a9z ,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u2202z\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 \u2032\n\u03c6 = 0 , in \u03a9x .\n\nin \u03a9 ,\n\n(13)\n\nThus we have replaced the resolution of the initial Singular Perturbation model (5) by the\nresolution of the system (12)-(13), which will be done iteratively.

Inserting this solution in (12), we\nconclude that the solution of the AP formulation converges for \u03b5 \u2192 0 towards the mean\nvalue part \u03c6\u0304(x), computed thanks to the Limit model\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 \u2212 \u2202 \u0100 \u2202 \u03c6\u0304 = f \u0304(x) , in \u03a9 ,\nx\n\u22a5\n\u2202x\n\u2202x\n(L)\n(15)\n\uf8f3\n\u03c6\u0304 = 0 on \u2202\u03a9x .\n\nThe AP reformulation (12)-(13) is equivalent to the Singular Perturbation problem (5)\nand is therefore valid for all 0 < \u03b5 < 1. This new formulation guarantees that, working with\na finite precision arithmetic, the computed solution converges in the limit \u03b5 \u2192 0 towards\nthe solution of the limit model (4). This is a huge difference with the original Singular\nPerturbation model which degenerates into an ill-posed problem. Thus, by using the APformulation, we expect the computation of the numerical solution to be accurate, uniformly\nin \u03b5.\nFor the detailed mathematical proofs, we refer to the next section.\n\n\f7\n\nAn asymptotic preserving scheme for strongly anisotropic elliptic problems\n\nRemark 2.3 The condition \u03c6\u2032 = 0 in (13) holds automatically for \u03b5 > 0, since the righthand side has zero average along the z-coordinate.

It is then a simple consequence of the decomposition (9), that the probRL\nlem (21)-(22) admits a unique solution (\u03c6\u2032\u03b5 , \u03c6\u03b5 ) \u2208 V \u00d7 W, where \u03c6\u03b5 (x) := L1z 0 z \u03c6\u03b5 (x, z)dz\nis the mean and \u03c6\u2032\u03b5 := \u03c6\u03b5 \u2212 \u03c6\u03b5 the fluctuation part. Thus we have also \u03c6\u2032\u03b5 = 0. This property\ncan also be understood from the fact that the right-hand side of (13), denoted in the sequel\nby g\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03c6\ng(x, z) := f \u2032 (x, z) +\nA\u2032\u22a5 (x, z) (x) ,\n\u2202x\n\u2202x\n\nhas zero mean value along the z-coordinate. Indeed, taking in (22) test functions \u03c8 \u2032 (x) \u2208 V\ndepending only on x, yields immediately that \u03c6\u2032\u03b5 = 0 for all \u03b5 > 0.\nStandard stability results for elliptic problems yield now the \u03b5-independent estimate for the\nsolution of the Singular Perturbation model (5)\n1\n||\u03c6\u03b5 ||2H 1 (\u03a9) \u2264 ||\u2202x \u03c6\u03b5 ||2L2 (\u03a9) + ||\u2202z \u03c6\u03b5 ||2L2 (\u03a9) \u2264 C||f ||2L2 (\u03a9) ,\n\u03b5\nimplying that ||\u03c6\u03b5 ||2H 1 (\u03a9x ) \u2264 C||f ||2L2 (\u03a9) and ||\u03c6\u2032\u03b5 ||2H 1 (\u03a9) \u2264 C||f ||2L2 (\u03a9) , with a constant C > 0\nindependent of \u03b5 > 0. Thus there exist some functions (\u03c6\u20320 , \u03c60 ) \u2208 V \u00d7 W, such that, up to a\nsubsequence \u03c6\u2032\u03b5 \u21c0\u03b5\u21920 \u03c6\u20320 in H 1 (\u03a9) and \u03c6\u03b5 \u21c0\u03b5\u21920 \u03c60 in H 1 (\u03a9x ). Hence we have\nZ\n\n0\n\nLx\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nLz\n\n\u03c6\u2032\u03b5 (x, z)\u03c8(x, z)dx dz\n\n\u2192\u03b5\u21920\n\nZ\n\nLx\n\n0\n\nZ\n\nLz\n0\n\n\u03c6\u20320 (x, z)\u03c8(x, z)dx dz ,\n\n\u2200\u03c8 \u2208 V .\n\nTaking here \u03c8(x) \u2208 V depending only on the x-coordinate, we observe that the feature\n\u03c6\u2032 \u03b5 \u2261 0 yields the crucial property of the limit solution \u03c6\u2032 0 \u2261 0. Passing now to the limit\n\u03b5 \u2192 0 in (22), we get that \u03c6\u20320 is solution of\na0 (\u03c6\u20320 , \u03c8 \u2032 ) = 0 ,\n\n\u2200\u03c8 \u2032 \u2208 V ,\n\nwith\n\n\u03c6\u20320 = 0\n\nin \u03a9x ,\n\nwhich is the weak form of (14) and implies \u03c6\u20320 \u2261 0. Finally, passing to the limit in (21),\nyields that \u03c60 is the unique solution of the Limit model (4). Because of the uniqueness of\nthe limit (\u03c6\u20320 , \u03c60 ), we deduce that the whole sequence (\u03c6\u2032\u03b5 , \u03c6\u03b5 ) converges weakly towards this\nlimit. To conclude the first part of the proof, we shall show the strong L2 convergences. For\nthis, taking in (22) \u03c6\u2032\u03b5 as test function and passing to the limit \u03b5 \u2192 0, yields \u2202z \u03c6\u2032\u03b5 \u2192 0 in\nL2 (\u03a9). As \u03c6\u2032\u03b5 \u2208 V and \u03c6 \u0304\u2032\u03b5 = 0, the Poincar\u00e9 inequality\n||\u03c6\u2032\u03b5 ||L2 \u2264 C||\u2202z \u03c6\u2032\u03b5 ||L2 ,\nis valid and implies that \u03c6\u2032\u03b5 \u2192 0 in L2 (\u03a9). The convergence \u03c6 \u0304\u03b5 \u2192 \u03c6 \u03040 in L2 (\u03a9x ) is immediate\nby compacity. It remains finally to prove the equivalence between (20) and (21)-(22). This\nis immediate. Indeed, if (\u03c6\u2032\u03b5 , \u03c6\u03b5 ) \u2208 V \u00d7 W is solution of (21)-(22), then (\u03c6\u2032\u03b5 , \u03c6\u03b5 , 0) is solution\n\n\fAn asymptotic preserving scheme for strongly anisotropic elliptic problems\n\n10\n\nof (20). And if (\u03c6\u2032\u03b5 , \u03c6\u03b5 , P \u03b5 ) \u2208 V \u00d7 W \u00d7 W satisfies (20), then P \u03b5 \u2261 0 (obvious by taking as\ntest function in (20) \u03c8 \u2032 (x) \u2208 V depending only on x) and (\u03c6\u2032\u03b5 , \u03c6\u03b5 ) solves hence (21)-(22).\nThe subject of the next section will be the numerical resolution of the AP-formulation\n(12)-(13) (or (20)) and this shall be done iteratively via a fixed-point application. Let us\nthus introduce here the fixed-point map, construct an iterative sequence and analyze its\nconvergence. In the rest of this section, the parameter \u03b5 > 0 shall be considered as fixed.\nDue to the fact that the two systems (20) and (21)-(22) are equivalent, we shall concentrate\non the simpler one, i.e. (21)-(22). Let us define the Hilbert space\nU := {\u03c8(*, *) \u2208 V / \u03c8 = 0} ,\nassociated with the scalar product\n(\u03c6, \u03c8)\u2217 :=\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nLxZ Lz\n\nAz \u2202z \u03c6 \u2202z \u03c8dzdx + \u03b5\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n0\n\nLxZ Lz\n\nA\u22a5 \u2202x \u03c6 \u2202x \u03c8dzdx ,\n\n0\n\nwhich is equivalent to the scalar product (*, *)V on V, defined by (18).\nThe fixed-point map T : U \u2192 U is defined as follows: With \u03c6\u2032 \u2208 U we associate \u03c6 \u2208 W, solution of (21). Then constructing the right-hand side of (22) via this \u03c6 \u2208 W, we define T (\u03c6\u2032 )\nas the corresponding solution of (22). Denoting by (\u03c6\u2032\u2217 , \u03c6\u2217 ) \u2208 V \u00d7 W the unique solution of\n(21)-(22), we remark by Theorem 2.4 that \u03c6\u2032\u2217 \u2208 U and that it is the unique fixed-point of\nthe map T .\nTheorem 2.5 Let \u03b5 > 0 be fixed and let \u03c6\u2032\u2217 \u2208 U be the unique fixed-point of the application\nT : U \u2192 U constructed as follows\n\u03c6\u2032 \u2208 U\n\n(21)\n\n\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\n\u03c6\u2208W\n\n(22)\n\n\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\nT (\u03c6\u2032 ) \u2208 U .\n\nThen for every starting point \u03c6\u20320 \u2208 U, the sequence \u03c6\u2032k := T (\u03c6\u2032k\u22121 ) = T k (\u03c6\u20320 ) converges in\n(U, || * ||\u2217 ), and consequently also in (U, || * ||V ), towards the fixed-point \u03c6\u2032\u2217 \u2208 U of T .\nThe proof of this theorem is based on the following\nLemma 2.6 [8] Let (U, || * ||\u2217 ) be a normed space and T : U \u2192 U a contractive application,\ni.e.\n||T (\u03c6) \u2212 T (\u03c8)||\u2217 < ||\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c8||\u2217 , \u2200\u03c6, \u03c8 \u2208 U with \u03c6 6= \u03c8 .\nThen the set of fixed-points of T, denoted by F P (T ), is identical with the set of accumulation\npoints of the sequences {T k (\u03c6)}k\u2208N , with \u03c6 \u2208 U, set which is denoted by AP (T ). Moreover,\nthese two spaces contain at most one element.\nProof of theorem 2.5 :\n(21)\nThe linear application T is well-defined. The first step \u03c6\u2032 \u2208 U \u2212\u2212\u2192 \u03c6 \u2208 W is immediate\nby the Lax-Milgram theorem. For the second step, we remark that for given \u03c6 \u2208 W the\nequation\n(23)\na(\u03b8, \u03c8 \u2032 ) = \u03b5(f \u2032 , \u03c8 \u2032 ) \u2212 \u03b5c(\u03c8 \u2032 , \u03c6) , \u2200\u03c8 \u2032 \u2208 V ,\nhas a unique solution \u03b8 \u2208 U. Indeed, we notice first (by taking test functions only depending\non the x-coordinate) that \u03b8 = 0. This enables us to consider instead of (23), the variational\nformulation\n(24)\nm(\u03b8, \u03c8 \u2032 ) = \u03b5(f \u2032 , \u03c8 \u2032 ) \u2212 \u03b5c(\u03c8 \u2032 , \u03c6) , \u2200\u03c8 \u2032 \u2208 V ,\n\n\f11\n\nAn asymptotic preserving scheme for strongly anisotropic elliptic problems\n\nwhere the bilinear form a(*, *), which is not coercive, was replaced by the coercive bilinear\nform m(*, *), given by\n\"Z\n# \"Z\n#\nZ\nLz\nLz\n\u03b5M\u22a5 Lx\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nm(\u03b8, \u03c8 ) := a(\u03b8, \u03c8 ) +\n\u2202x \u03b8(x, z)dz\n\u2202x \u03c8 (x, z)dz dx .\n(25)\nLz 0\n0\n0\nIndeed, due to the property \u03b8 = 0, the two equations (23) and (24) are equivalent and this\ntime m(*, *) is a continuous, coercive bilinear form, as for all \u03c8 \u2032 \u2208 V we have\nm(\u03c8 \u2032 , \u03c8 \u2032 ) \u2265\n\nZ\n\nLx\n0\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nLz\n\nAz |\u2202z \u03c8 \u2032 |2 dzdx + \u03b5\n\nLx\n\nZ\n\nLz\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n0\n\nA\u22a5 |\u2202x \u03c8 \u2032 |2 dzdx \u2265 C||\u03c8 \u2032 ||2V .\n\nThus the Lax-Milgram theorem implies the existence and uniqueness of a solution \u03b8 \u2208 U of\nthe continuous problem (24) and hence also of problem (23). We have shown by this that\nT is a well-defined mapping.\nFurthermore we know that T admits, for fixed \u03b5 > 0, a unique fixed-point, denoted by\n\u03c6\u2032\u2217 \u2208 U. Let us now suppose that we have shown that T is contractive. Then lemma 2.6\nimplies that F P (T ) = AP (T ) = {\u03c6\u2032\u2217 }. Thus choosing an arbitrary starting point \u03c6\u20320 \u2208 U,\nand constructing the sequence \u03c6\u2032k := T (\u03c6\u2032k\u22121 ) = T k (\u03c6\u20320 ), we deduce that this sequence has\na unique accumulation point \u03c6\u2032\u2217 in U. This means that the sequence {\u03c6\u2032k }k\u2208N converges in\n(U, || * ||\u2217 ) towards \u03c6\u2032\u2217 . Due to the fact that || * ||\u2217 and || * ||V are equivalent norms, we have\nalso the convergence in (U, || * ||V ).\nIt remains to show that T is contractive. For this\nfunctions.

Due to the equivalence of (29) and (21)-(22), one can comment that the introduction of P (x) is superfluous,\n\n\f13\n\nAn asymptotic preserving scheme for strongly anisotropic elliptic problems\n\nbut this is not the case for the discretized equations. The property \u03c6\u2032 = 0 is indeed automatically fulfilled since the right-hand side of equation (22) has a zero mean value along\nthe z-coordinate. However the discrete implementation of this quantity introduces round-off\nerrors which probably will destroy the zero mean value property and justify the introduction\nof the Lagrange multiplier.\nFor simplicity reasons we omitted here the \u03b5-index of the solution (\u03c6\u2032\u03b5 , \u03c6\u03b5 ), the parameter\n\u03b5 > 0 being considered as fixed.\nTo discretize now the system (29) we introduce the grid\n0 = z1 \u2264 * * * \u2264 zk \u2264 * * * \u2264 zNz = L z\n\n0 = x0 \u2264 * * * \u2264 xn \u2264 * * * \u2264 xNx +1 = Lx ,\n\nand denote the cells by In := [xn , xn+1 ] and Jk := [zk , zk+1 ].

We denote by \u03c6P , \u03c6L and \u03c6A , respectively, the numerical solutions of the Singular\nPerturbation model (5), the Limit model (4) and the Asymptotic Preserving formulation\n(12)-(13).

Dashed lines : (S)\nStandard scheme : discretization of the P-model; Stars : (AP) AP-scheme;\nCircles : (L) discretization of the L-model.\nAs can be seen from Table 1 and Figure 1, the finite element resolution of the Singular\nPerturbation model is precise only for large 0 < \u03b5 < 1, whereas the Limit model is accurate\nfor small \u03b5 \u226a 1. The range of \u03b5-values in which both the Singular Perturbation and the\nLimit models provide an accurate approximation of the solution shrinks as the mesh size is\nrefined. For a coarse grid (with 50 \u00d7 50 points see figure 1(a)) this domain ranges from 10\u221212\nto 10\u22123 while it is reduced to 10\u22129 \u2212 10\u22125 for the refined 500 \u00d7 500 grid (figure 1(b)). This\nquestion is determinant for the development of a model coupling strategy. Indeed it requires\nan intermediate area where both discretized models furnish an accurate approximation and\nwe observe that for refined meshes this area may not exist. This reduction of the validity\ndomain can be explained for both the L-model and P-model but for quite different reasons.\n\n\f15\n\nAn asymptotic preserving scheme for strongly anisotropic elliptic problems\n\u03b5\nAP-scheme\nS-scheme\nL-model\n\n10\n3.4 * 10\u22122\n2.8 * 10\u22122\n9.9\n\n1\n7.8 * 10\u22123\n4.5 * 10\u22123\n1.0 * 101\n\n10\u22121\n3.8 * 10\u22123\n2.8 * 10\u22123\n1.0 * 10\u22121\n\n10\u22124\n2.7 * 10\u22123\n2.7 * 10\u22123\n2.8 * 10\u22123\n\n10\u221214\n2.7 * 10\u22123\n6.6 * 10\u22122\n2.7 * 10\u22123\n\n10\u221216\n2.7 * 10\u22123\n1.2\n2.7 * 10\u22123\n\nTable 1: Absolute error in the l\u221e -norm for the approximation computed thanks to the\nAP-scheme, discretized Singular Perturbation and Limit models (S-scheme and\nL-model) as compared to the exact solution.\nThe numerical approximation computed via the Limit model is altered by both the\ndiscretization error of the numerical scheme and the approximation error introduced by the\nreduction of the initial Singular Perturbation problem to the Limit problem. For coarse\ngrids, the global error is rapidly dominated by the scheme discretization error, but as the\nmesh is refined, the approximation error becomes preponderant, as the Limit model is precise\nonly for small \u03b5-values. The schemes implemented here are of second order, thus when the\nmesh size is divided by ten, the discretization error is reduced by one hundred. The global\nerror for the L-model displayed in figure 1(a) does not depend on \u03b5 as soon as \u03b5 < 10\u22123 .\nBelow this limit the L-model is able to furnish a better approximation of the solution with\nvanishing \u03b5, however the numerical scheme is not precise enough and consequently the global\nerror does not decrease. For the refined mesh, this discretization error is lowered by two\norder of magnitudes and the global error is a function of \u03b5 as long as its value is greater\nthan 10\u22125 (Fig. 1(b)).\nThe analysis for the Singular Perturbation model is quite complementary. The accuracy\nof the approximation provided by the P-model is good for large \u03b5-values and deteriorates\nrapidly for small ones. This can be explained by the conditioning of the linear system\nobtained by the P-model discretization. An estimate of the condition number for the matrix\nis displayed in figure 2 for two different grid sizes. This conditioning deteriorates with\nvanishing \u03b5-parameter, which is coherent with the fact that, working with a finite-precision\narithmetic, the Singular Perturbation model degenerates into an ill-posed problem. This\nalso explains the blow up of the error displayed in figure 1 as soon as the conditioning of\nthe matrix approaches the critical value of the double precision (materialized by the level\n1015 in Fig. 2). This limit is reached on more refined meshes for larger \u03b5-values (\u03b5 \u2248 10\u221212\non a 50 \u00d7 50 grid and \u03b5 \u2248 10\u221210 on a 200 \u00d7 200 grid). As expected, the P-model, though\nvalid for all \u03b5-values, cannot be exploited numerically for small \u03b5. The \u03b5-region where both\nthe P-model and the L-model are accurate all-together, shrinks dramatically with the size\nof the mesh, fact which motivates the development of the AP-method.\nThe condition number estimate of the linear system providing the approximation of the\nsolution for the AP-scheme is also plotted in Figure 2. The conditioning of the system is\nrather \u03b5 independent and this is due to the introduction of the Lagrange multiplier, which\nforces the system in the limit to remain well-posed. The accuracy of the AP-scheme is totally\ncomparable to the P-model for the large values of \u03b5 and to the L-model for the smallest ones.\nThe AP-formulation is a good tool for computing an approximation for the solution which\nis accurate uniformly in 0 < \u03b5 < 1 and is therefore of great practical interest. Note that this\napproximation is obtained thanks to an iterative sequence {\u03c6\u2032k }k\u2208N , constructed with the\nfixed-point mapping T defined in theorem 2.5. The convergence of this iterative process is\nanalysed in figure 3 on a 200 \u00d7 200 grid for a large value of \u03b5. The l2 -absolute error between\nthe mean respectively the fluctuating parts of the exact solution and the approximation\nprovided by the AP-scheme are plotted as a function of the iteration number. The sequence\nis initiated with the zero function. With the iterative process, both components converge\ntowards the solution until the precision of the schemes is reached.

With this aim the anisotropic elliptic\nproblem is solved with a positive source term, in this case an approximation of the Dirac\n\u03b4-function. This function denoted \u03b4ah has a support included in a subset ([\u2212a, a] \u00d7 [\u2212a, a],\nwith 0 < a < 1) of the simulation domainr [\u22121, 1] \u00d7 [\u22121, 1]. Two different parameters a are\nchosen, a = 10\u22121 and a = 10\u22122 .\nThe simulation domain is discretized by a 500 \u00d7 500 mesh. For the smallest value of\na the support of the function is reduced to 5 cells in each direction. The source term \u03b4ah\nis normalized, such that the maximal value of \u03b4ah grows with vanishing a-parameter. In\ntable 2 the maxima and minima of the numerical approximations computed by the APscheme (\u03c6A ) and the discretized Singular Perturbation model (\u03c6P ) are gathered for the\ntwo source functions \u03b4ah . Only large \u03b5-values are considered to verify the positivity of the\nnumerical approximations. Indeed for very small \u03b5 the solution is reduced to its mean part\nwhich is the solution of a classical elliptic problem preserving the maximum principle. This\nmeans that the relevant question is related to configurations where the fluctuating part \u03c6\u2032\nhas a significant contribution to the elliptic problem solution. In this range of large and\nintermediate \u03b5 values, both approximations are comparable. Only slight differences can be\nobserved on the maxima for the smallest \u03b5-parameters. The results of table 2 demonstrate\nthe positivity of the approximations computed by either the AP-scheme or the Singular\nPerturbation model.\n\n\f17\n\nAn asymptotic preserving scheme for strongly anisotropic elliptic problems\n102\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\u22121\n\n10\u22122\n\n10\u22123\n\nmax(\u03c6P )\nmax(\u03c6A )\n\n77.58\n77.58\n\n3.82\n3.82\n\n1.63\n1.63\n\n8.93\n8.93\n\n7.22\n6.89\n\n6.93\n6.89\n\nmin(\u03c6P )\nmin(\u03c6A )\n\n1.9 10\u22127\n1.9 10\u22127\n\n2.5 10\u22127\n2.5 10\u22127\n\n2.4 10\u22122\n2.4 10\u22122\n\n2.4 10\u22122\n2.4 10\u22122\n\n2.8 10\u22122\n2.8 10\u22122\n\n2.8 10\u22122\n2.8 10\u22122\n\nmax(\u03c6P )\nmax(\u03c6A )\n\n1.8 102\n1.8 102\n\n7.1 101\n7.1 101\n\n2.6 101\n2.6 101\n\n1.2 101\n1.2 101\n\n8.29\n7.14\n\n7.34\n7.11\n\nmin(\u03c6P )\n\n1.6 10\u22127\n\n2.5 10\u22123\n\n2.4 10\u22122\n\n2.8 10\u22122\n\n2.8 10\u22122\n\n2.8 10\u22122\n\nmin(\u03c6A )\n\n1.6 10\u22127\n\n2.5 10\u22123\n\n2.4 10\u22122\n\n2.8 10\u22122\n\n2.8 10\u22122\n\n2.8 10\u22122\n\na = 10\u22122\n\na = 10\u22121\n\n\u03b5\n\nTable 2: Maxima and minima of the numerical solutions computed thanks to the\nAP-scheme (\u03c6A ) and the Singular Perturbation model (\u03c6P ).

Moreover we shall explain why we have to introduce the Lagrange multiplier in order\nto solve numerically this equation. We remark that in contrast to section 3 we omitted\nfor simplicity reasons the primes for \u03c6, which indicated the fluctuation functions with zero\nmean value.\nThe weak form of (35) is\na(\u03c6, \u03c8) = \u03b5(g, \u03c8) , \u2200\u03c8 \u2208 V ,\n(36)\nor equivalently\nm(\u03c6, \u03c8) = \u03b5(g, \u03c8) ,\n\n\u2200\u03c8 \u2208 V ,\n\n(37)\n\nwhere m(*, *) is the coercive bilinear form defined in (25). Let us now consider the corresponding discrete problem\na(\u03c6h , \u03c8h ) = \u03b5(g, \u03c8h ) ,\n\n\u2200\u03c8h \u2208 Vh ,\n\n(38)\n\nwhere the finite dimensional space Vh \u2282 V was introduced in section 3.1. It can be seen that\nthe property g = 0 induces also in the discrete case that \u03c6h = 0. Thus, following the same\narguments as for the continuous case, we can show that equation (38) is equivalent to\nm(\u03c6h , \u03c8h ) = \u03b5(g, \u03c8h ) ,\n\n\u2200\u03c8h \u2208 Vh .\n\n(39)\n\nThe Lax-Milgram theorem implies then the existence and uniqueness of a discrete solution\n\u03c6h \u2208 Vh . The next theorem gives an estimate of the discretization error ||\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6h ||V .\nWe shall suppose in the sequel, that the diffusion matrices A\u22a5 , Az and the function f are\nregular enough, to be able to use standard regularity/interpolation results.\n\n\fAn asymptotic preserving scheme for strongly anisotropic elliptic problems\n\n18\n\nTheorem 4.1 Let \u03c6 \u2208 V be the unique solution of the continuous problem (36) and \u03c6h \u2208 Vh\nthe unique solution of the discrete problem (38). Both solutions are elements of the normed\nspace (U, || * ||U ), where\nU := {\u03c8(*, *) \u2208 V / \u03c8 = 0}\n\nwith\n\n||\u03c8||U := ||\u2202z \u03c8||L2 (\u03a9) .\n\nThen we have the following discretization error estimate\n||\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6h ||2V = ||\u2202z \u03c6 \u2212 \u2202z \u03c6h ||2L2 + \u03b5||\u2202x \u03c6 \u2212 \u2202x \u03c6h ||2L2 \u2264 Ch2 ,\n\n(40)\n\nwith a constant C > 0 independent of \u03b5 > 0. Moreover, as \u03c6, \u03c6h \u2208 U, we have\n||\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6h ||2U \u2264 Ch2 .\nProof: The fact that both solutions \u03c6 and \u03c6h belong to the space U is an immediate\nconsequence of the fact that the right-hand side of the equation (36) (resp. (38)) satisfies\ng = 0. The discretization error estimate is rather standard. Denoting by \u03c6I the interpolant\nof \u03c6 in the finite dimensional space Vh , i.e.\n\u03c6I (x, z) :=\n\nNx X\nNz\nX\n\n\u03c6(xn , zk )\u03c7n (x)\u03bak (z) ,\n\nn=1 k=1\n\nwe have due to the coercivity of the bilinear form m(*, *)\nc||\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6h ||2V \u2264 m(\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6h , \u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6h ) = m(\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6h , \u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6I ) \u2264 c||\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6h ||V ||\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6I ||V .\nThus\n||\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6h ||V \u2264 c||\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6I ||V .\nStandard Q1 finite element interpolation results [26] yield for the interpolation error\n||\u2202x \u03c6 \u2212 \u2202x \u03c6I ||2L2 + ||\u2202z \u03c6 \u2212 \u2202z \u03c6I ||2L2 \u2264 ch2 (||\u2202xx \u03c6||2L2 + ||\u2202zz \u03c6||2L2 ) ,\nand regularity results for the solution \u03c6 of (36), imply \u03b52 ||\u2202xx \u03c6||2L2 + ||\u2202zz \u03c6||2L2 \u2264 c\u03b52 . This\nlast estimate can be found by applying standard H 2 regularity results on the\u221asolution \u03c6\u03b5 of\nthe initial Singular Perturbation problem (5) (after a change of variable \u03be := \u03b5x) and then\nexploiting the decomposition \u03c6\u03b5 = \u03c6\u2032\u03b5 + \u03c6 \u0304\u03b5 . Thus, we have altogether with a constant c > 0\nindependent of \u03b5 > 0\n\u03b5||\u2202x \u03c6 \u2212 \u2202x \u03c6h ||2L2 + ||\u2202z \u03c6 \u2212 \u2202z \u03c6h ||2L2 \u2264 ch2 .\n\nWhat is important to observe from the error estimate (40) is that for \u03b5 \u2192 0 the error\n||\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6h ||H 1 in the standard \u03b5-independent H 1 -norm blows up. This is one argument why\nthe Singular Perturbation model is inaccurate for \u03b5 \u226a 1. However, in the case where \u03c6 and\n\u03c6h are elements of the space U, we have ||\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6h ||U \u2264 Ch2 independently of \u03b5, which means\nthat we have convergence of the scheme in (U, || * ||U ), uniformly in \u03b5 > 0. The Poincar\u00e9\ninequality implies then the uniform convergence in the || * ||L2 norm. The AP-scheme is thus\nequally accurate for every value of 0 < \u03b5 < 1.\nThe discretization error \u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6h is not the only error we are introducing when solving numerically (38) instead of (36).

However, if both functions \u03c6h and\n\u03c6 \u0303h belong to U, then we have the \u03b5-independent estimate\n||\u03c6h \u2212 \u03c6 \u0303h ||U \u2264 c||v \u2212 \u1e7d||2 .\n\nProof: Let us denote within this proof Enk := \u03b1nk \u2212 \u03b1\u0303nk for n = 1, * * * , Nx , k =\n1, * * * , Nz and eh (x, z) := \u03c6h (x, z) \u2212 \u03c6 \u0303h (x, z), such that\neh (x, z) =\n\nNx X\nNz\nX\n\nEnk \u03c7n (x)\u03bak (z) .\n\nn=1 k=1\nN\nMoreover let N P\n:= NP\nbe an arbitrary vector associated with the funcx Nz and Y \u2208 R\nNx\nNz\ntion yh (x, z) = n=1 k=1 Ynk \u03c7n (x)\u03bak (z).

This yields, as\nm(*, *) is also coercive on U, that\n||M E||2\n\n=\n\nm(yh , eh )\nm(yh , eh )\n\u2265c\nsup\n\u2265 c||eh ||U .\n||Y ||2\nyh \u2208U ,yh 6=0 ||yh ||U\nY \u2208RN ,Y 6=0\nsup\n\nand thus the \u03b5-independent estimate is proved.\nSimilarly as for the discretization error, we can deduce from the round-off error estimate\n(43) that, for \u03b5 \u2192 0, the standard H 1 -norm ||\u03c6h \u2212 \u03c6 \u0303h ||H 1 explodes. However if we impose\nthat both solutions \u03c6h and \u03c6 \u0303h are elements of the space U, space of functions with mean\nvalue along the z-coordinate equal to zero, then we have the uniform estimate ||\u03c6h \u2212 \u03c6 \u0303h ||U \u2264\nc||v \u2212 \u1e7d||2 , and by the Poincar\u00e9 inequality ||\u03c6h \u2212 \u03c6 \u0303h ||L2 \u2264 c||v \u2212 \u1e7d||2 . Unfortunately even if\nwe know that \u03c6h \u2208 U, this is not necessarily true for \u03c6 \u0303h , if we discretize (35). But it can be\nachieved by forcing the numerical solution \u03c6 \u0303h to satisfy \u03c6 \u0303h = 0. Indeed, this can be done\nby introducing explicitly in the discrete problem (38) the constraint \u03c6h = 0, such that it is\nmuch more ingenious to solve instead\n(\na(\u03c6h , \u03c8h ) + b(Ph , \u03c8h ) = \u03b5(g, \u03c8h ) , \u2200\u03c8h \u2208 Vh ,\n(44)\nb(Qh , \u03c6h ) = 0 , \u2200Qh \u2208 Wh ,\nwhere Wh \u2282 W was constructed in section 3.1. As mentioned in the continuous case this\nproblem is equivalent for \u03b5 > 0 to the discrete problem (38). If \u03c6h \u2208 Vh is the unique\nsolution of (38), then (\u03c6h , 0) \u2208 Vh \u00d7 Wh is a solution of (44). And if (\u03c6h , Ph ) \u2208 Vh \u00d7 Wh\nsolves (44), then Ph \u2261 0 and \u03c6h \u2208 Vh is the unique solution of (38). This last statement\nis immediately proved by taking in the variational formulation (44) only x-dependent test\nfunctions \u03c8h (x) \u2208 Vh . By doing this, we can be sure that the numerical solution \u03c6 \u0303h of (44)\nsatisfies \u03c6 \u0303h = 0, such that the error ||\u03c6h \u2212 \u03c6 \u0303h ||U is uniformly bounded. This proves that\nthe introduction of the constraint \u03c6h = 0 in the AP-formulation is crucial and avoids the\nnumerical difficulties associated with the original P-model.\n\n5\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this paper we have introduced an Asymptotic Preserving formulation for the resolution of\na highly anisotropic elliptic equation. We have shown the advantages of the AP-formulation\nas compared to the initial Singular Perturbation model and to its limit model, when the\nasymptotic parameter goes to zero. It came out that the AP-scheme is a powerful tool for\nthe resolution of elliptic problems presenting huge anisotropies along one coordinate, and\ngives access to the simulation in a very easy and precise manner. The Asymptotic-Preserving\nmethod developed here relies on the decomposition of the solution in its mean part along the\nanisotropy direction, and a fluctuation part. This integration along the anisotropy direction\nis easily performed in the context of Cartesian coordinate systems with one coordinate\naligned with the direction of the anisotropy. In a forthcoming work [9] this procedure is\nextended to more general anisotropies.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis work has been partially supported by the Marie Curie Actions of the European Commission in the frame of the DEASE project (MEST-CT-2005-021122) and by the CEA-Cesta\nin the framework of the contracts 'Dynamo-3D' # 4600108543 and 'Magnefig' # 06.31.044.\n\n\fAn asymptotic preserving scheme for strongly anisotropic elliptic problems\n\n21\n\nReferences\n[1] J.
