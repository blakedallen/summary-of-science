This letter is a continuation of the work [21], where the emphasis is on\ntwisted topological structures.\nThe main focus will be on Wu classes vi , which are mod 2 characteristic classes that can be\nwritten as polynomials over Z2 in the Steifel-Whitney classes wj of same and/or lower degrees. In\nthe lowest two degrees these structures are familiar: v1 is the obstruction to manifold orientation,\nand v2 is the obstruction to having a Pin\u2212 structure. The latter structure has many interesting\napplications to low-dimensional topology [13]. In high dimensions, Wu classes have interesting\napplications to surgery problems. In degrees four and six, the Wu classes have applications to the\nM5-brane partition function [32] [11] and to topological aspects of type IIB string theory [32] [1],\nrespectively.\nWhat we do in this paper can be summarized as follows\n1. We interpret Wu structures themselves already as twisted structures defined by the StiefelWhitney classes. These structures include Spin structures and Membrane structures [21]. This is\ndone in section 3.\n2. In section 4 we introduce the notion of twisted Wu structure, which in cohomological degree\ntwo is related to twisted Spin structure (cf. [31] [7]). In degree four this will be a generalization of\ntwisted Membrane structure, introduced in [21].\n3. We also introduce structures that we call Wuc structures in section 5. In the appropriate degrees,\nthese are generalizations of the Spinc structure and of the StringK(Z,3) structure (cf. [21]).\n4. Finally, in section 6, we describe a twist for the Wuc structures leading to twisted Wuc structures.\nThese are generalizations of twisted Spinc (and twisted Pinc ) structures and twisted StringK(Z,3)\nstructures [21] in degree 3 and degree 7, respectively.\n\n1\n\n\fThroughout, we emphasize the motivation and the relation to M-branes via examples. These\nexample also include (spacetime) M-theory and type II string theory.\n\n2\n\nWu classes and Wu structures\n\nWe start by providing a basic description and properties of the Wu classes and Wu structures that\nwill be used in later sections.\n\n2.1\n\nWu classes\n\nThe Stiefel-Whitney classes in termsSof the Wu classes. Let BO denote the classifying\nspace of the stable orthogonal group O = \u221e\nk=0 O(k). The i-dimensional universal Wu class vi is\ni\nthe element of H (BO; Z2 ) defined inductively via the Steenrod square Sq j as (cf. [16][25] [26])\nv0 = w0 = 1 and wi = vi + Sq 1 vi\u22121 + * * * + Sq i v0 if i \u2265 1.\n\n(2.1)\n\nThese classes can also be defined for manifolds via the classifying map. Let M n be a closed\nn-dimensional manifold and consider the action of the Steenrod square on the cohomology of\nthe manifold Sq i : H n (M ; Z2 ) \u2192 H n+i (M ; Z2 ). By Poincar\u00e9 duality, there are unique classes\nvi \u2208 H i (M ; Z2 ) satisfying\nhvi \u222a x, [M ]i = hSq i x, [M ]i\n(2.2)\nfor all x \u2208 H n\u22121 (M ; Z2 ). Thus the relation is (cf. [17] [28])\nv0 (M ) = 1 and wi (M ) = vi (M ) + Sq 1 vi\u22121 (M ) + * * * + Sq i v0 (M ) if i \u2265 1.\n\n(2.3)\n\nThat is, if f denotes the classifying map for the stable tangent bundle of M , then f \u2217 wi = wi (M )\nand f \u2217 vi = vi (M ) if i \u2265 0. Since Sq i x = 0 for i > n \u2212 i, the classes vanish: vi = 0 for i > [ n2 ]. The\nclass\n(2.4)\nv = 1 + v2 + * * * + v[ n2 ] \u2208 H \u2217 (M ; Z2 )\nis the total Wu class of M . The total Stiefel-Whitney class w = 1 + w1 + w2 + * * * + wn of M is\ndetermined by the Wu formula w = Sq(v), where Sq = 1 + Sq 1 + Sq 2 + * * * is the total Steenrod\nsquare operation. The WuP\nformula can be expanded as 1 + w1 + * * * = Sq 0 (1 + v1 + * * * ) + Sq 1 (1 +\nv1 + * * * ) + * * * . Via wi = ij=0 Sq i\u2212j vj , the first few classes are\nw1 = Sq 0 (1) + Sq 0 (v1 ) = v1 ,\nw2 = Sq 2 (1) + Sq 1 (v1 ) + Sq 0 (v2 ) = v12 + v2 ,\nw3 = Sq 3 (1) + Sq 2 (v1 ) + Sq 1 (v2 ) + Sq 0 (v3 ) = Sq 1 (v2 ) + v3 .\nSince Stiefel-Whitney classes are more familiar than Wu classes, we are generally more interested\nin inverting the above relations.\nThe Wu classes in terms of the Stiefel-Whitney classes. The above relation, i.e. the Wu\nformula, for the Steifel-Whitney classes in terms of the Wu classes can be inverted to get the latter\nclasses as polynomials in the former classes. We describe two ways of doing this. The first is to\nuse the anti-automorphism (canonical conjugation) \u03c7(A(2)) on the mod 2 Steenrod algebra A(2).\nThe second way uses the Todd classes Tdi .\n2\n\n\f1. Anti-automorphism: One can invert the relation and write the total Wu class in terms of the\ntotal Stiefel-Whitney class\nv(M ) = \u03c7(Sq)w(M ) .\n(2.5)\nPn\nThe anti-automorphism \u03c7 is defined recursively using Thom's recursion formula i=0 Sq i \u03c7(Sq n\u2212i ) =\nn\n0. Since the mod 2 Steenrod algebra is generated multiplicatively by the elements Sq 2 , \u03c7 is den\nn\n2 + \u03c7(Sq 2n ) =\n[29] Sq\ntermined completely by knowledge of \u03c7(Sq 2 ) for all n. The identity\n\u0010\n\u0011\nPn\u22121 Qn\u22121 Qi\nn\nn\nn\u22121\nn\u22121\n2n\u2212j Sq 2n\u2212i allow for\nSq 2 \u03c7(Sq 2 ) and the formula \u03c7(Sq 2 ) = Sq 2 + i=1\ni=1\nj=1 Sq\nexplicit calculation of \u03c7. There is, in fact, an explicit formula for individual Wu\nP classes in terms\nof the Stiefel-Whitney classes [33]. It follows from the Wu formula that vn = ni=1 \u03b8 n\u2212i wi , where\n\u03b8 l = \u03c7(Sq l ) \u2208 A(2) is the conjugation of Sq l in A(2) and is defined inductively by\nl\n\nl\n\n\u03b8 = Sq +\n\nl\u22121\nX\n\ni l\u2212i\n\nSq \u03b8\n\nl\n\n= Sq +\n\nl\u22121\nX\n\n\u03b8 l\u2212j Sq j .\n\n(2.6)\n\nj=1\n\ni=1\n\nFor l = 0, \u03b8 0 = 1 and for l = 1, \u03b8 1 = Sq 1 . The odd-dimensional terms are given in terms of the\neven-dimensional ones via \u03b8 2n+1 = \u03b8 2n Sq 1 .\n2. Todd classes: The second method is much easier and uses the relation between the Wu classes\nand the Todd classes, as polynomials in the Steiefel-Whitney classes (and not in the Chern classes),\ni.e. Tdn (w1 , * * * , wn ). The formula is given by (see [10])\nvn \u2261 2n * Tdn (w1 , * * * , wn ) mod 2 ,\n\n(2.7)\n\nthrough which the expansion of the Wu classes can be most efficiently read off from the corresponding expansion of the Todd genus. For example, for the low degree classes of most direct relevance\nto us, we have\nv1 = w1 ,\nv2 = w2 + w12 ,\nv3 = w1 w2 ,\nv4 = w4 + w3 w1 + w22 + w14 ,\nv5 = w4 w1 + w3 w12 + w22 w1 + w2 w13 ,\nv6 = w4 w2 + w4 w12 + w32 + w3 w2 w1 + w3 w12 + w22 w12 .\n\n(2.8)\n\nAdditivity property of Wu classes. From relation (2.5) , and using the formula w(E \u2295 F ) =\nw(E)\u222aw(F ), we immediately see that v(E \u2295F ) = \u03c7(Sq)(w(E \u2295F )) = \u03c7(Sq) (w(E) \u222a w(F )), which\nis equal to \u03c7(Sq)(w(E)) \u222a \u03c7(Sq)(w(F )) so that the Wu class is additive under Whitney sum, i.e.,\nit satisfies\nv(E \u2295 F ) = v(E) \u222a v(F ) .\n(2.9)\nExample 1. Consider the second Wu class. We have v2 (E \u2295 F ) equals to w2 (E \u2295 F ) + w1 (E \u2295\nF ) \u222a w1 (E \u2295 F ). Expanding, the first summand gives w2 (E) + w2 (F ) + w1 (E)w1 (F ), while the\nsecond summand gives w1 (E)2 + w1 (F )2 + 2w1 (E)w1 (F ). Since w is a mod 2 class, we have\n2w1 (E)w1 (F ) = 0. Therefore, altogether we have w2 (E)+ w2 (F )+ w1 (E)2 + w1 (F )2 + w1 (E)w1 (F ),\nwhich can be written as v2 (E) + v2 (F ) + v1 (E)v1 (F ).\n3\n\n\fAs we will consider structures defined by Wu classes, it would be useful to get some idea of\nwhen such classes vanish in relation to Stiefel-Whitney classes.\n(Non)vanishing of the Wu classes. The Stiefel-Whitney numbers wi1 * * * wir [M m ], for i1 +\n* * * ir = m, determine the cobordism class of the m-manifold M [27]. This implies, in particular,\nthat if n > 0 and M is not a boundary then there must be an i > 0 for which vi 6= 0. Let\nBk\u2217 = H \u2217 (BO; Z2 )/I(vi | i > k), where I(vi | i > k) is the ideal generated over the Steenrod\nalgebra by the classes vi , i > k. For k = 1, B1\u2217 has v = 1 + v1 and w = Sqv = 1 + v1 + v12 with\n0 = Sq 1 (v12 ) = Sq 1 w2 = w3 + w2 w1 = w2 w1 = v13 . Thus B1\u2217 = Z2 \u2295 Z2 \u2295 Z2 with basis 1, v1 , v12 .\nIt can be shown by induction that Bk\u2217 is finite-dimensional [28]. Contrary to what happens with\nStiefel-Whitney classes, there is a closed manifold M n which bounds with nonvanishing Wu class\n[28] v = 1 + v1 + v2 + v3 for n > 7, v = 1 + v1 + v2 for n > 5, and v = 1 + v1 for n > 2.\nExample 2. Every closed seven-manifold M 7 which fibers over the sphere S 5 or S 6 is a boundary.\n\u03c0\ni\n\u03c0\ni\nThat is there are bundles \u03a32 \u2192 M 7 \u2192 S 5 for which vi = 0 for i > 1 and bundles S 1 \u2192 M 7 \u2192 S 6\nfor which vi = 0 for i > 0. Similarly, every closed eleven-manifolds Y 11 which fibers over the\nsphere S j with 7 \u2264 j \u2264 10 is a boundary. In this case vi = 0 for i > 2, i > 1, i > 1 and i > 0,\ncorresponding respectively to the cases j = 7, 8, 9, and 10.\nOdd-dimensional Wu classes. The odd-dimensional Wu classes can be written in terms of the\nlower Wu classes via the formula [33]\nX\ni\n(2.10)\nv2n+1 =\n(w1 )2 \u22121 v2n+2\u22122i .\ni\u22651\n\nThis immediately implies that for oriented manifolds the odd-dimensional Wu classes are all zero.\nIn fact, for x \u2208 H n\u22122i\u22121 (M ), the same conclusion can be reached from the relation Sq 2i+1 (x) =\nSq 1 Sq 2i (x) = v1 \u222a Sq 2i (x) = w1 \u222a Sq 2i (x).\nExample 3. Special class of manifolds. Consider manifolds M whose total Stiefel-Whitney\nclass w(M ) has nonzero\nP components only in degrees that are powers of 2, i.e. it satisfies the\ncondition w(M ) = 1 + j\u22651 w2j\u22121 . This is satisfied by a class of manifolds which include projective\nspaces. For example, for real projective spaces we have w(RP 5 ) = 1 + a2 + a4 , w(RP 9 ) = 1 + a2 + a8\nand w(RP 11 ) = 1+a4 +a8 , where a is the class of the real classifying line bundle. For such manifolds,\nthe Wu classes have the explicit form [33]\nvi =\nvi =\n\nm\nX\nm\u2212j\n(w2j\u22121 )2\n\nj=1\nm\nX\n\nn\nX\n\nif i = 2m\u22121 \u2265 1 ,\nk\u22121 )/2j\u22121 ]\n\n(w2j\u22121 )[(i\u22122\n\nk\u2212j\u22121\n\n(w2k )2\n\nif i = 2m\u22121 + 2n\u22121 with n > m \u2265 1 ,\n\nj=1 k=m+1\n\nvi = 0\n\notherwise.\n\n\u0001 i\nP\nIndeed for the real projective space RP n , the total Wu class is v(RP n ) = ni=0 n\u2212i\ni a where a\nis the class of the classifying real line bundle. We will discuss the significance of powers of the\nSteifel-Whitney classes (especially squares) in our context in section 5.\n4\n\n\f2.2\n\nWu structures via classifying spaces\n\nConsider the principal fibration BO[v2k ] over the classifying space BO of the orthogonal group, with\nfiber the Eilenberg-MacLane space K(Z2 , 2k\u22121), and with Postnikov invariant of the fibration equal\nto the Wu class v2k \u2208 H 2k (BO; Z2 ). Given a fixed classifying map f : X \u2192 BO which represents a\nvector bundle \u03be over X, by a Wu structure on \u03be we mean a lifting f \u0303 : X \u2192 BO[v2k ] of the map f ,\nf = p \u25e6 f \u0303, where p is the projection of the fibration. The obstruction is obviously v2k (\u03be) = f \u2217 (v2k ).\nIf it vanishes then the set of all Wu structures on \u03be, denoted by W u(\u03be) or W u(f ) obtains the\nnatural structure of an affine space over H 2k\u22121 (X; Z2 ).\nDefinition 1 ([3] [15]) A Wu structure on a space M is a lifting of the classifying space map\nf : M \u2192 BO to the connected cover BO[vi ] obtained from BO by killing the class vi . We have the\nfollowing diagram\n(2.11)\nBO[vi ] .\nn7\nf\u02c6 n n\n\u03c0\nn\nn\n\u000f\nf\nnn\n/ BO\nM\n\nThe space BO[vi ] is a principal fibration over BO with fiber the Eilenberg-MacLane space\nK(Z2 , i \u2212 1)\n=\n/ K(Z2 , i \u2212 1) ,\n(2.12)\nK(Z2 , i \u2212 1)\n\u000f\n\n\u000f\n/ EK(Z2 , i)\n\nBO[vi ]\n\u03c0\n\n\u000f\n\nk\n\nBO\n\n\u000f\n/ K(Z2 , i)\n\nwhere the k-invariant of the fibration is an element vi in the cohomology H i (BO; Z2 ) defined by\nthe ith Wu class vi of the universal bundle over BO.\nWu structures can be induced from other structures; for instance\n(1) Spin structure: A Spin structure leads to a Wu structure, because of the existence of the map\nBSpin \u2192 BO[vk ]. In fact, this holds for many structures, including a framing and all connected\ncovers F of the orthogonal group such as String structure. This is captured by the commutative\ndiagram\nBF G\n\nq\n\nGG\nGG\nGG\nGG\n#\n\n/ BSO[vk ] .\nss\nsss\ns\ns\n\u03c0\nsy ss\n\n(2.13)\n\nBSO\n\n(2) Dimension: Because of the fact that Wu classes vanish in degree above half the dimension of\nthe manifold, we can have a Wu structure in the right degrees simply by this dimension argument.\nFor example, on (8k + 2)-dimensional spaces, the Wu class v4k+2 is always zero [3]. This is useful\nin studying the M5-brane as well as type IIB string theory (cf. [22]).\n\n5\n\n\f3\n\nWu structures as twisted structures\n\nThe idea of this section is that the Wu structures themselves already can be interpreted as twisted\nstructures corresponding to the Stiefel-Whitney classes of the same degree. This provides connections to various other structures. We describe the main point as follows. Rewrite relation (2.1)\nas\nvi = wi \u2212 (Sq 1 vi\u22121 + * * * + Sq i v0 ) := wj \u2212 \u03b1i for i = 2j ,\n(3.1)\nso that the terms involving the lower degree Wu classes can be interpreted as a twist for the\nstructure defined by wi = 0. In low degrees, we see that this corresponds to twisted Spin structure\n(for j = 1) and twisted Membrane structure (for j = 2). With this point of view, our definition is\nDefinition 2 Let (X, \u03b1i ) be a compact topological space with a degree i cocycle \u03b1i : X \u2192 K(Z2 , i)\nwith i = 2j . A Wu structure over X is a quadruple (M, \u03bd, \u03b9, \u03b7), where\n(1) M is a smooth compact oriented manifold together with a fixed classifying map of its stable\nnormal bundle \u03bd : M \u2192 BO;\n(2) \u03b9 : M \u2192 X is a continuous map;\n(3) \u03b7 is an \u03b1-twisted structure on M defined by wi (M ) + \u03b9\u2217 \u03b1i = 0, that is, a homotopy commutative\ndiagram\n\u03bd\n\n/\no BO\no\no\nooo\n,\nwi\n\u03b9\nooo\u03b7\no\no\n\u000f\n\u000f s{ oo\n/ K(Z2 , i)\nX\n\u03b1i\n\nM\n\n(3.2)\n\nwhere \u03b7 is a homotopy between wi \u25e6 \u03bd and \u03b1 \u25e6 \u03b9.\nRemarks. 1. The above definition is inspired by definitions of other related structures in [31]\n[24] [21].\n2. In the above definition, we can replace K(Z2 , i) by the product K(Z2 , i1 ) \u00d7 K(Z2 , i2 ) \u00d7 * * * \u00d7\nK(Z2 , ir ), where i1 + * * * + ir = i. This product maps to K(Z2 , i).\n3. Two Wu structures in this sense will be equivalent on M if there is a homotopy between the\ncorresponding homotopies \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 .\nWe record the idea above in the following\nProposition 3 A Wu structure in degree 2i is a twisted structure for the structure defined by the\nStiefel-Whitney class in the same degree.\nOur main example will be a Pin\u2212 structure (see [13]), since a v2 -structure is a Pin\u2212 structure.\nThe second Wu class v2 is equal to the combination of Stiefel-Whitney classes w2 + w12 . If a given\nmanifold M is not Spin then w2 (M ) 6= 0. Since this takes values in Z2 , the only nonzero value is\n1. This means that one can add to w2 (M ) a Z2 -class \u03b11 , in this case equal to w1 (M )2 , such that\nv2 = w2 (M ) + \u03b11 = 0 \u2208 H 2 (M ; Z2 ).\n\n6\n\n\fPin\u2212 structures. A Pin\u2212 structure on M is equivalent to a Spin structure on T M \u2295 det(T M ).\nThe obstruction for existence of a Pin\u2212 structure on M is the characteristic class w2 (M ) + w1 (M )2 .\nIf M admits a Pin\u2212 structure, then the set of such structures Pin\u2212 (T M ) is acted upon freely\nand transitively by H 1 (M ; Z2 ). In more detail, consider the two nontrivial central extensions\np\u00b1 : Pin(n)\u00b1 \u2192 O(n) of the orthogonal group O(n) by Z2 . A Pin\u00b1 structure on a vector bundle E\nis a lifting of the structure group from O(n) to its double cover Pin(n)\u00b1 . The short exact sequence\np\u00b1\n\n1 \u2192 Z2 \u2192 Pin\u00b1 (n) \u2212\u2192 O(n) \u2192 1 gives rise to an exact sequence\n(p\u00b1 )\u2217\n\n\u03b40\n\n\u03b4\n\nH 0 (X, O(n)) \u2192 H 1 (X; Z2 ) \u2192 H 1 (X, Pin\u00b1 (n)) \u2212\u2192 H 1 (X, O(n)) \u2192 H 2 (X; Z2 ) .\nBp\u00b1\n\n(3.3)\n\n\u03c9\n\nApplying the classifying functor B gives BPin\u00b1 (n) \u2212\u2192 BO(n) \u2192 K(Z2 , 2). Now a classifying map\nfE : X \u2192 BO(n) of an O(n) bundle E has a lift to BPin\u00b1 (n) if and only if \u03c9 \u25e6 fE is homotopic\nto zero. Since [X, K(Z, 2)] \u223c\n= H 2 (X; Z2 ), this is true when the the generators of H 2 (BO(n); Z2 )\n2\npull back to zero in H (X; Z2 ). These pullback classes are w2 (E) and w2 (E) + w1 (E)2 . The first\ncorresponds to Pin+ structures and the second to Pin\u2212 structures. See [13] for more details.\nLet 0 \u2192 E1 \u2192 E2 \u2192 E3 \u2192 0 be a short exact sequence of real vector bundles. Let {i, j, k} be\na permutation of {1, 2, 3}. If Ei is Spin and Ej is Pin\u01eb , Ek has a natural Pin\u2212\u01eb structure. On the\nother hand, if Ei is Pin\u01eb , Ej is Pin\u2212\u01eb , and Ek is orientable, Ek has a natural Spin structure.\nExample 4. Let L be the real classifying line bundle over the real projective space RP m and let\nx = w1 (L) be the generator of H 1 (RP m ; Z2 ) = Z2 . Then T (RP m ) \u2295 1 = (m + 1) * L, w1 (RP m ) =\n(m + 1) * x and w2 (RP m ) = 21 m(m + 1) * x2 . Then RP 4k+2 and RP 4k+3 are both Pin\u2212 . In\nfact, each admits two Pin\u2212 structures. However, RP4k+3 is also Spin but RP 4k+2 is not, since\neven-dimensional real projective spaces are not orientable.\nWe have seen in section 2.2 that Wu structures can result from Spin and other structures. Here\nwe illustrate the point for the Pin\u2212 case. This will require replacing BSO by BO in diagram (2.13).\nWu structures from Pin\u2212 structures. Using the Adem relation Sq 4k+2 = Sq 2 (Sq 4k +Sq 4k\u22121 Sq 1 ),\nin H \u2217 (BO; Z2 ) the following equality holds [15]\nv4k+2 =\n\nr\nX\n\nai * Sq Ii v2\n\n(3.4)\n\ni=1\n\nfor certain classes ai \u2208 H \u2217 (BO; Z2 ) and certain Steenrod operations Sq Ii \u2208 A(2), the mod 2\nSteenrod algebra, and r \u2265 1. This gives a universal Wu structure for Pin\u2212 bundles, so there exist\nWu structures on the universal vector bundle over BPin\u2212 . As described in [9], one of them can be\nfixed by taking a map q : BPin\u2212 \u2192 BO[v4k+2 ] that completes the commutative diagram\nBPin\u2212H\n\nq\n\nHH\nHH\nHH\nHH\n$\n\nBO\n\n/ BO[v4k+2 ]\ns\nsss\ns\ns\ns \u03c0\nsy ss\n\n(3.5)\n\nwith the natural projection BPin\u2212 \u2192 BO. Now, given a vector bundle \u03be over X and its classifying\nmap f : X \u2192 BO, we have the affine map qf : Pin\u2212 (\u03be) \u2192 W u(\u03be) which sends each lifting\n7\n\n\ff \u0303 : X \u2192 BPin\u2212 to q \u25e6 f \u0303. Here Pin\u2212 (\u03be) and Wu(\u03be) are, respectively, the set of Pin\u2212 structures and\nWu structures on the bundle \u03be.\nSpecial cases. When the composite Stiefel-Whitney classes are zero, the Wu class coincides with\nthe Stiefel-Whitney class in that degree \u2013 at least for degrees that are powers of 2. In low degrees,\nWu structures reduce to\n1. Spin structure: Here v2 = w2 when w1 = 0.\n2. Membrane structure: We have v4 = w4 when w1 = w2 = 0. This corresponds to the first Spin\ncharacteristic class Q1 = p21 , which is half the first Pontrjagin class p1 , being divisible by 2 [21].\n3. Dual membrane structure: In this case, v8 = w8 , when w1 = w2 = w4 = 0. This corresponds\nto the second Spin characteristic class Q2 = p22 , which is half the second Pontrjagin class p2 , being\ndivisible by 2\nQ2 = w8 mod 2 .\n(3.6)\nWorking 2-locally, the vanishing of this class also means we have a Fivebrane structure [23].\n\n4\n\nTwisted Wu structures\n\nA twisted Wu structure will be essentially defined by the condition v + \u03b1 = 0. More specifically, a\ntwisted Wu(i) structure is defined by the condition vi + \u03b1i = 0, where \u03b1i \u2208 H i Z2 . Thus, a twisted\nWu(i) structure on a manifold X is described by the diagram\nf\n\n/ BO[vj ]\nX PPP\nPPP y\u0001 zzzzzz\nPPP \u03b7\nvi\nP\n\u03b1i PPPP\n(\n\u000f\nK(Z2 , i) ,\n\n(4.1)\n\nwhere \u03b7 is a homotopy between the map representing the class vi and the cocycle \u03b1i . More generally,\nwe can also define such a twisted notion of Wu structure on a brane M .\nDefinition 4 Let (X, \u03b1i ) be a compact topological space with a degree i cocycle \u03b1 : X \u2192 K(Z2 , i).\nA twisted Wu structure over X is a quadruple (M, \u03bd, \u03b9, \u03b7), where\n(1) M is a smooth compact oriented manifold together with a fixed classifying map of its stable\nnormal bundle \u03bd : M \u2192 BO;\n(2) \u03b9 : M \u2192 X is a continuous map;\n(3) \u03b7 is an \u03b1-twisted structure on M defined by vi (M ) + \u03b9\u2217 \u03b1i = 0, that is, a homotopy commutative\ndiagram with a map \u03b9 : M \u2192 X\n\u03bd\n\n/\nq BO[vj ]\nq\nq\nqqq\nvi\n\u03b9\nqqq\u03b7q\nq\nq\n\u000f\n\u000f t| qq\n/ K(Z2 , i) ,\nX\n\u03b1i\n\nM\n\nwhere \u03b7 is a homotopy between vi \u25e6 \u03bd and \u03b1 \u25e6 \u03b9.\n\n8\n\n(4.2)\n\n\fRemarks. 1. We have used BO[vj ] to indicate that we might have some structure arising from\nWu-connected cover of BO and not just BO itself (although in applications, the latter is more\ndominant).\n2. When all the composite Stiefel-Whitney classes are zero (or all Wu classes vj for j < i = 2k are\nzero) this reduces to wi + \u03b1i = 0. Then, for i = 2 and 8, we have a twisted Spin structure [31] and\na twisted Membrane structure [21], given respectively by w2 + \u03b12 = 0 and w4 + \u03b14 = 0.\nExample 5. Twisted Pin\u2212 structures. Let us consider the degree two case. We know that\nv2 is the obstruction for a Pin\u2212 structure. When a manifold does not admit a Pin\u2212 structure, this\nmeans that v2 6= 0. Since the Wu class is valued in Z2 , being nonzero means it is 1 \u2208 Z2 . This\nimplies that adding a nonzero class in H 2 (M ; Z2 ) will lead to a zero class for the sum, because this\nwill be 2-torsion. Therefore, if a manifold does not admit a Pin\u2212 structure then it certainly admits\nwhat we call a twisted Pin\u2212 structure (cf. definition 5 below). Examples of this include the real\nprojective spaces RP4k and RP4k+1 .\nDefinition 5 A twisted Pin\u2212 structure is a twisted Wu structure in the sense of definition 4 for\ni = 2.\nExample 6. Type IIA superstring theory with a B-field on an orientifold. An orientifold\nis roughly a smooth manifold together with an involution and is encoded in a double cover \u03c0 :\nX\u03c9 \u2192 X of orbifolds, where \u03c9 \u2208 H 1 (X; Z2 ) is the equivalence class of the double cover. A B-field\nin this context is a differential cohomology class taking values in a certain Postnikov truncation of\nconnected real K-theory ko [7]. For type IIA string theory, one of the main results of [7] is that the\nfirst and second Stiefel-Whitney classes of 10-dimensional orientifold spacetime X are w1 (X) = \u03c9\nand w2 (X) = \u03c9 2 + a(B) \u222a \u03c9, where a(B) \u2208 H 1 (X; Z2 ) is a certain class which accounts for the\npresence of the B-field. Now we see that if \u03c9 6= 0 and a(B) 6= 0, i.e. if we have a nontrivial orientifold\nand B-field, then the two expressions can be combined to give w2 (X) + w1 (X)2 = a(B) \u222a \u03c9. We can\nwrite this as v2 + \u03b12 = 0, so that this structure indeed corresponds to a twisted Wu(2)-structure;\nin fact it corresponds to the special case of twisted Pin\u2212 structure described above.\nObservation 1 A twisted Spin structure in the sense of [7] is a twisted Wu structure in the sense\nof this paper, with the twist provided by both the orientifold double cover and the B-field.\nExample 7. Type IIB string theory and twisted differential cocycles. The self-dual field\nin type IIB string theory is delicate and requires some machinery to describe. In [1] this is given\nby a Chern-Simons functional. Such a description requires dealing with differential integral Wu\nclasses \u03bb\u030c which are elements of the category \u021ev6 of \u03bd-twisted differential 6-cocycles. This is a torsor\nfor differential characters \u021e6 and whose objects are differential cocycles such that v6 = a(\u03bb\u030c) mod\n2, where a(\u03bb\u030c) is the characteristic class of \u03bb\u030c. Instead of viewing this as a character twisted by the\nWu structure, we will turn it around and view it as a Wu structure twisted by the character. The\nreason for this is that the Wu class defines a bundle(-like) structure, which should be the 'main'\nstructure, while the character is a slight modification. This is analogous to treating the 41 p1 -shifted\ndifferential characters of [6] as twisted String structure in [24].\nObservation 2 A v-twisted differential character in the sense of [1] is an instance of a twisted\nWu structure in the sense of this paper.\n9\n\n\f5\n\nWuc structures\n\nIn this section we consider structures coming from Wu classes on which the action of the Bockstein\nvanishes. This Bockstein operation \u03b2 : H i (X; Z2 ) \u2192 H i+1 (X; Z) is associated with the exact\n2\nsequence of coefficients 0 \u2192 Z \u2192 Z \u2192 Z2 \u2192 0. We define a Wuc structure as an integral lift of a\nWu structure. Therefore, a Wuc class is defined via the Bockstein on the corresponding Wu class,\nthat is\nDefinition 6 (i). A Wuc characteristic class is given by Vi+1 := \u03b2vi \u2208 H i+1 (BO; Z). This is the\nobstruction to having a Wuc structure.\n(ii). A Wu(i)c structure on a manifold M is defined by Vi+1 (M ) := \u03b2vi (M ) = 0 \u2208 H i+1 (M ; Z),\nwith vi (M ) = f \u2217 vi a pullback via the classifying map of the universal Wu class. That is, vi is the\nmodulo 2 reduction of an integral class.\nRemarks. 1. The Wuc characteristic class coincides with the integral Stiefel-Whitney class when\nthe Wu class is indecomposable.\n2. As in the case for integral Stiefel-Whitney classes, the Wuc classes are also mostly relevant in the\nodd-dimensional case, i.e. for j odd in Vj . However, for \u03b22 the Bockstein homomorphism coming\nfrom the exact coefficient sequence 0 \u2192 Z4 \u2192 Z4 \u2192 Z2 \u2192 0 instead of the above sequence, the\ncondition w1 (M )2 = 0 is equivalent to \u03b22 (w1 (M ) = 0 and has application to manifolds of dimension\n4k + 1 [8].\nSpecial cases. We consider specializations of the Wuc structure depending on the dimension. We\nwill need to understand the action of the Bockstein \u03b2 acting on products of Stiefel-Whitney classes.\nLet us start with the case when this product is a square. Note that \u03b2 is an integral lift of Sq 1 , which\nis a derivation and hence Sq 1 (x2 ) = Sq 1 (x)x + xSq 1 (x) = 2xSq 1 (x) = 0. This means that \u03b2(x2 )\n\u00d72\n\n\u03c12\n\n\u03b2\n\nmust be a class that maps to 0 when reduced modulo 2. From the sequence Z \u2212\u2192 Z \u2212\u2192 Z2 \u2212\u2192 Z\nwe see that if \u03b2(x2 ) = 0 mod 2, it must be twice a class, i.e. \u03b2(x2 ) = 2y for some integral class\ny. Furthermore, y cannot be \u03b2(z) for any mod class z, except 0, since 2\u03b2(z) = 0. Now since our\nclasses are Stiefel-Whitney classes, we see that \u03b2(w22 ) = 0 since w22 = \u03c12 (p1 ) and that \u03b2(w42 ) = 0\nsince w42 = \u03c12 (p2 ). Therefore, squares of Stiefel-Whitney classes vanish in our range of dimensions\nin the oriented cas.\n1. A Wu(2)c structure is defined when V3 = \u03b2v2 = \u03b2(w2 + w12 ) = 0, that is by W3 + \u03b2(w12 ) = 0.\nIf we impose orientation then this immediately gives a Spinc structure. However, in full generality,\nthe Wu(2)c structure can be interpreted as a Pinc structure (see below).\n2. A Wu(4)c structure is defined, in the oriented case, when V5 = \u03b2v4 = \u03b2(w4 + w22 ) = 0. When we\nhave the Spin condition in addition, this reduces to the condition \u03b2w4 = 0, which is the obstruction\nto a Membranec structure, introduced in [21]. Without the Spin requirement, a Wu(4)c structure\nmight seem be a a twisted Membranec structure (defined in [21]) with the twist given by the integral\nclass \u03b2(w22 ). However, as we saw above, w22 admits an integral lift, and hence the would be twist\n\u03b2(w22 ) is zero. We can consider this in more generality: the class w4 + w22 is in fact the mod 2\nreduction of the class which defines a Stringc structure [20] (see below). An application for complex\nmanifolds [5] gives c2 \u2212 c21 mod 2 = w4 + w22 \u2208 H 4 (X; Z2 ).\n\n10\n\n\f3. A Wu(6)c structure is defined, in the oriented case, by imposing V7 = \u03b2v6 = \u03b2(w2 w4 ) = 0.\nObviously, when we have either a Spin structure or a Membrane structure, then this condition is\nsatisfied. In general, the Wu formula gives w6 = Sq 2 w4 + w2 w4 . At the level of Chern classes, this\nsays that \u03c12 c3 = Sq 2 (\u03c12 c2 ) + \u03c12 (c1 c2 ) mod 2.\nWe now summarize the main points above in the following\nProposition 7 (Properties of Wuc structures) .\n1. A W u(4)c structure is the same as a Membranec structure.\n2. (i) A Spin structure implies a W u(6)c structure.\n(ii) A Membrane structure implies a W u(6)c structure.\n3. The obstructions to Wuc structures are additive for bundles, i.e. (\u03b2v)(E \u2295 F ) = \u03b2v(E) + \u03b2v(F ).\nApplication. Pinc structure. Let \u03c12 : H 2 (M ; Z) \u2192 H 2 (M ; Z2 ) be the mod 2 reduction. By\ndefinition, a bundle E is Pinc if and only if w2 (E) \u2208 image(\u03c12 ), that is W3 (E) = \u03b2w2 (E) = 0 [13].\nAs w1 (E)2 = \u03c12 (c1 (E \u2297 C)), w2 (E) \u2208 image(\u03c1) if and only if w2 (E) + w1 (E)2 \u2208 image(\u03c12 ) Note\nthat if we have a sequence of bundles 0 \u2192 E1 \u2192 E2 \u2192 E3 \u2192 0 with Ei Spinc and Ej Pinc , for\n{i, j, k} a permutation of {1, 2, 3}, then Ek has a natural Pinc structure. On the other hand, if Ei\nand Ej are Pinc , and Ek is orientable, then Ek has a natural Spinc structure.\nExample 8. The real projective spaces RP 4k , RP 4k+2 , and RP 4k+3 are all Pinc . However, the\nlatter is also Spin, unlike the former two, since real projective spaces of even dimension are nonorientable.\nExample 9. Wuc structure in M-theory. Consider M-theory on an 11-dimensional Spin manifold Y 11 with a C-field, as described in [6]. From the inclusion H 4 (Y 11 ; Z2 ) \u0592\u2192 H 4 (Y 11 , R/Z) \u0592\u2192\n\u021e 4 (Y 11 ), the cohomology class w4 (Y 11 ) \u2208 H 4 (Y 11 ; Z2 ) defines a differential cohomology class w\u030c4 .\nThe characteristic class of this flat character is the integral class W5 (Y 11 ) = \u03b2w4 (Y 11 ). This class\nis interpreted [6] as the background magnetic charge induced by the topology of Y 11 and should\nvanish to be able to formulate the C-field. On Spin manifolds, W5 (Y 11 ) = 0 since the class \u03bb is the\nintegral lift of w4 (Y 11 ). Now, on a Spin manifold we have the fourth Wu class v4 = w4 , so that we\nhave as condition the vanishing of the integral lift of the Wu class v4 , i.e.\nV5 (Y 11 ) = \u03b2v4 (Y 11 ) = 0 .\n\n(5.1)\n\nTherefore, the C-field in M-theory leads to a Wu(4)c structure.\nFor manifolds of dimension 4k, the characteristic elements for the intersection pairing in the\nmiddle dimension are the integer lifts \u03bb of the Wu-class v2k .\nExample 10. Wuc structure for the M5-brane. The study of the partition function of the\nM5-brane in [32] [11] lifted to eight dimensions requires a mod 2 middle cohomology class to lift\nto an integral class. If the M5-brane worldvolume if not Spin (this happens often) then instead of\n\u03b2w4 = 0 we will have \u03b2v4 = 0, that is W5 \u2212 \u03b2(w22 ) = 0. This defines a Wu(4)c structure. We can\nalso interpret this as a twisted Membranec structure.\n\n11\n\n\fMod 2 reduction and Wuc structure. Since the Steenrod square, the mod 2 reduction, and\nthe Bockstein are related as Sq 1 = \u03c12 \u03b2, we have Sq 1 vi = \u03c12 (\u03b2vi ), so we have that a Wuc structure\nimplies that Sq 1 vi = 0 in that degree. This latter condition appears naturally when considering\nWu classes of Spin bundles (see Appendix in [11]): Sq 1 v4k (E) = 0 for a Spin bundle E. Conversely,\nthis condition, which is always satisfied in the Spin case, implies that the mod 2 reduction of the\nWuc class in degree 4k + 1 is zero. For example, let E be a real vector bundle over a space X and\nconsider the degree four Wu class v4 . Applying Sq 1 gives Sq 1 v4 U = Sq 1 \u03c7(Sq 4 )U , which by property\nof \u03c7 gives \u03c7(Sq 4 Sq 1 )U . Now using the Adem relation Sq 2 Sq 3 = Sq 4 Sq 1 , this gives \u03c7(Sq 2 Sq 3 )U .\nApplying the definition of \u03c7 leads to \u03c7(Sq 3 )Sq 2 U . Since the bundle is assumed to be Spin we have\nSq 2 U = w2 U = 0, so that Sq 1 v4 = 0.\nWe now consider the integral lifts of the Wu classes. We seek to characterize classes x such that\n\u03c12 (x) = v, according to degrees. The discussion will proceed according to whether the degrees are\nof the form 4k or 4k + 2. We start with the first case and illustrate for degree 4 and degree 8, the\ndegrees which seem most relevant for applications.\nStringc structures and integral lifts of the Wu class v4 .\nobstruction [4]\nQ1 + c2 = 0 \u2208 H 4 (M ; Z) ,\n\nA Stringc structure is defined by\n(5.2)\n\nwhere c is the first Chern class of the complex line bundle which defines the Spinc structure. On\nthe other hand, in the oriented case the Wu class v4 is given in terms of the Stiefel-Whitney classes\nas v4 = w4 + w22 . Since w4 is the mod 2 reduction of the first Spin class Q1 = 21 p1 and w2 is the\nmod 2 reduction of the first Chern class c, we have that w4 + w22 is the mod 2 reduction of the\nQ1 + c2 . We have used the formula w2 (M ) \u222a c = c \u222a c mod 2 in the case when our manifold is\noriented, with c \u2208 H 2 (M ; Z). Therefore, we have found an integral lift of the Wu class in this case\nProposition 8 An integral lift of a Wu(4)-structure on oriented 4-manifolds is given by a Stringc\nstructure.\nFivebraneK(Z,4) structures and integral lifts of the Wu class v8 .\nFivebraneK(Z,4) structure, defined by the condition [21]\nQ2 + e2 = 0 \u2208 H 8 (M ; Z) ,\n\nNow we consider a\n(5.3)\n\nwhere e is the degree four class of a K(Z, 3) bundle. In the Spin case we have v8 = w8 + w42 , since\nw4 \u222a e = e \u222a e mod 2. Therefore, similarly to the degree 4 case above, we have\nProposition 9 An integral lift of a Wu(8)-structure on Spin 8-manifolds is given by a FivebraneK(Z,4)\nstructure.\nWe now consider the Wu classes of degree 4k + 2.\nSquares of odd-dimensional Steifel-Whitney classes and torsion Pontrjagin classes.\nThe Wu classes in degrees 2j contain squares of classes of degree j, i.e. (wj )2 . For low degree\ncases, this can be seen explicitly from (2.8). We already understand the structures implied by the\n12\n\n\findecomposable Stiefel-Whitney classes (and hence of corresponding Wu classes), at least in lower\ndegrees. The most notable decomposable terms not involving w1 are the squares mentioned above.\nHence, we would like to gain a better understanding of such terms. For j odd, we do this using\ntorsion Pontrjagin classes [30]. These classes are P4k+2 with an indexing such that P4i = pi coincide\nwith the usual ith Pontrjagin classes. For the degrees 4k + 2 (hence corresponding to half-integer\nindexing had we kept the usual notation) are 2-torsion: 2P4k+2 = 0 \u2208 H 4k+2 Z. One way to define\nthese classes for a vector bundle E is via the action of the Bockstein and the Steenrod square\non the Stiefel-Whitney classes in degree 2k + 1, that is P4k+2 (E) = \u03b2Sq 2k w2k+1 (E). The mod 2\nreduction \u03c12 : H 4k+2 (X; Z) \u2192 H 4k+2 (X; Z2 ) of these classes gives precisely the desired squares of\nStiefel-Whitney classes \u03c12 P4k+2 (E) = w2k+1 (E)2 . Therefore, in the situation where the the Wu\nclass is given by the squares, we can find an integral lift.\nProposition 10 In the situation described above, the integral lifts of the Wu classes are the torsion\nPontrjagin classes.\nExample 11. We illustrate the proposition in low degree examples.\n1. Degree two: v2 = w2 + w12 . If w2 = 0, that is we have a Pin+ structure, then a lift of the\nWu(2) structure is given by the torsion Pontrjagin class P2 . We could also be in a situation where\nw2 = \u03c12 (c1 ), where c1 is the first Chern class.\n2. Degree six: In the oriented case we have v6 = w2 w4 + w32 . If w4 = 0, i.e. if we have a Membrane\nstructure [21] then v6 reduces to the square term w32 . Then we see that the integral lift of the Wu\nclass in this case if the torsion Pontrjagin class P6 . Note that we cannot instead set w2 = 0 as then\nw3 would also be zero.\n3. Degree ten: Here v10 will involve v2 , due to the formula (3.4). Hence we cannot possibly isolate\na square term. However, if such a term is present then it will be given by the torsion Pontrjagin\nclass P10 . Note that higher degree Stiefel-Whitney classes can be disposed of, for example when\nconsidering an oriented 11-manifold Y 11 for which w11 (Y 11 ) = w10 (Y 11 ) = w9 (Y 11 ) = 0 (by using\n[14]). This gets rid of any possible terms involving w10 and w9 in v10 .\n\n6\n\nTwisted Wuc structures\n\nIn this section we will take the Wuc structures we defined in the previous section and give them a\ntwist. That is, we will consider a slight relaxation of the Wuc condition. A twisted Wu(i)c structure\nwill be defined by the condition \u03b2vi + \u03b1i+1 = 0, where \u03b1i+1 is a degree i + 1 integral class. More\nprecisely, we have\nDefinition 11 Let (X, \u03b1i+1 ) be a compact topological space with a degree i + 1 integral cocycle\n\u03b1i+1 : X \u2192 K(Z, i + 1). A twisted Wuc structure over X is a quadruple (M, \u03bd, \u03b9, \u03b7), where\n(1) M is a smooth compact oriented manifold together with a fixed classifying map of its stable\nnormal bundle \u03bd : M \u2192 BO;\n(2) \u03b9 : M \u2192 X is a continuous map;\n(3) \u03b7 is an \u03b1-twisted structure on M defined by Vi+1 (M ) + \u03b9\u2217 \u03b1i+1 = 0, that is, a homotopy com-\n\n13\n\n\fmutative diagram\n\u03bd\n\n/\no BO[vj ]\no\no\nooo\n\u03b9\nVi+1\noo\u03b7o\no\no\n\u000f\n\u000f s{ ooo\n/\nX\n\u03b1i+1 K(Z, i + 1) ,\n\nM\n\n(6.1)\n\nwhere \u03b7 is a homotopy between wi \u25e6 \u03bd and \u03b1 \u25e6 \u03b9.\nRemarks. 1. The idea of the twisted Wu(i)c structure is that the Wu class might not be the\nmod 2 reduction of an integral class exactly, but only so up to an (auxiliary) integral class.\n2. If the composite Stiefel-Whitney classes all vanish, then a twisted Wu(i)c structure reduces\nto a twisted Pinc structure, twisted Membranec structure, and twisted String(K(Z,3) structure for\ni = 2, 4, and 6, respectively. The latter two are defined in [21], and so we now give a definition of\nthe first.\nDefinition 12 A twisted Pinc structure is a structure given in definition 11 for i = 2.\nWhen the twist is zero, this reduces to the usual Pinc structure.\nWe now consider a sample property of the twisted Wuc structures. The obstructions to twisted\nstructures are additive for bundles\n\nWuc\n\n(\u03b2v + \u03b1)(E \u2295 F ) = \u03b2v(E \u2295 F ) + \u03b1(E \u2295 F )\n= \u03b2v(E) + \u03b2v(F ) + \u03b1(E) + \u03b1(F ) ,\nprovided that \u03b1 is an additive class, as then we have\n\u03b2v(E \u2295 F ) = \u03b2v(E) + \u03b2v(F ) .\n\n(6.2)\n\nProposition 13 Wuc structures are additive.\nWe will find that for our applications we need a relative version of twisted Wuc structures.\nRelative versions of classical Wu classes are defined in [12], on which we build our generalization.\nRelative Wu classes. Consider a manifold Z with boundary Y and corresponding tangent\nbundles \u03c0 : T Z \u2192 Z and p : T Y \u2192 Y . The relative second Wu class v2 (Z, Y ) can be defined via\nthe diagram\nH 1 (T Y ; Z2 )\n\n\u03b4T\n\nO\n\n/ H 2 (T Z, T Y ; Z2 )\nO\n\u223c\n= \u03c0\u2217\n\n\u03c0\u2217\n\nH 1 (Y ; Z2 )\n\n(6.3)\n\n\u03b4\n\n/ H 2 (Z, Y ; Z2 )\n\ni.e. is the element (\u03c0 \u2217 )\u22121 \u25e6 \u03b4T (\u03c3), where \u03c3 is an element of the set of Pin\u2212 structures on T Y . If\nj : (Z, \u2205) \u2192 (Z, Y ) is the inclusion then j \u2217 v2 (Z, Y ; \u03c3) = v2 (Z) is the usual class for each \u03c3 in the\nset of Pin\u2212 structures Wu2 (Y ). The following proposition is a straightforward extension of a result\nin [2] in the Spin case.\n14\n\n\fProposition 14 The function v2 (Z, Y ) : Wu2 (Y ) \u2192 H 2 (Z, Y ; Z2 ) satisfies the following:\n(i) image(v2 (Z, Y )) = (j \u2217 )\u22121 (v2 (Z));\n(ii) if Z is 4-dimensional, a class v \u2208 H 2 (Z, Y ; Z2 ) lies in the image of v2 (Z, Y ) if and only if\nhv, j\u2217 (\u03be)i \u2261 \u03be * \u03be (mod 2) for each \u03be \u2208 H2 (Z);\n(iii) if x \u2208 H 1 (Y ; Z2 ) and \u03c3 \u2208 Wu2 (Y ), then\nv2 (Z, Y ; x * u) = v2 (Z, Y ; \u03c3) + \u03b4x.\nThus v2 (Z, Y ) is injective;\n(iv) if Z is 4-dimensional, then v2 (Z, Y ; \u03c3) = 0 if and only if the intersection pairing on the middle\nhomology of Z is even and \u03c3 = \u03c3Z .\nThe proof of (ii) follows from (i) and an application of the Wu formula. The latter also establishes the rest of the statements.\nNote that by Lefschetz duality D : H i (Z, Y ; Z2 ) \u2192 Hn\u2212i (Z; Z2 ) one gets an absolute homology\nclass which is dual to the relative cohomology class; hence for some purposes it might be more\nconvenient to work with homology. We use this in the propsitions below; see [22] for more extensive\napplications.\nThe above discussion on relative Pin\u2212 structures can be generalized to higher Wu structures.\nOur examples will keep us grounded and consider relatively low degree cases instead of aiming for\nutmost generality. We will need the following to consider the M5-brane case.\nRelative Wu class on eight-manifolds. Consider an 8-manifold Z 8 with boundary Y 7 and\ntangent bundles \u03c0 : T Z 8 \u2192 Z 8 and p : T Y 7 \u2192 Y 7 . The relative fourth Wu class v4 (Z 8 , Y 7 ) can be\ndefined via the diagram (6.3), with the obvious changes in the degrees of the cohomology groups,\nThis is the element (\u03c0 \u2217 )\u22121 \u25e6 \u03b4T (\u03c3), where \u03c3 is an element of Wu4 (Y 7 ), the set of Wu4 structures\non T Y 7 . Similarly, we have\nProposition 15 The function v4 (Z 8 , Y 7 ) : Wu4 (Y 7 ) \u2192 H 4 (Z 4 , Y 7 ; Z2 ) satisfies the following:\n(i) image(v4 (Z 8 , Y 7 )) = (j \u2217 )\u22121 (v4 (Z 8 ));\n(ii) a class v \u2208 H 4 (Z 8 , Y 7 ; Z2 ) lies in the image of v4 (Z 8 , Y 7 ) if and only if hv, j\u2217 (\u03be)i \u2261 \u03be * \u03be (mod\n2) for each \u03be \u2208 H4 (Z 8 );\n(iii) v4 (Z 8 , Y 7 ; \u03c3) = 0 if and only if the intersection pairing on the middle homology of Z 8 is even\nand \u03c3 = \u03c3Z .\nExample 12. Type IIB string theory. Similar results holds for the 6th Wu class on 12manifolds with boundary, relevant to type IIB string theory.\nWe now need a notion of relative Wuc -strucutre. A straightforward application of the general\nformulation in [12] to our Wuc classes (cf. Definition 6) gives the following defintion\nDefinition 16 For a pair of spaces (Z, Y ), we define a relative Wuc structure by applying the\nBockstein on the relative Wu classes, that is Vi+1 (Z, Y ) = \u03b2vi (Z, Y ).\nNext, we add the twist to our relative Wuc structures.\n15\n\n\fDefinition 17 A relative twisted Wuc ) structure on a pair (Z, Y ) is described by the diagram\nf\n/\nq BO[vj ]\nSSS\nq\nq\nq\nSSS t| \u03b7\nSSS\nVi+1\n\u03b1i+1 SSSSS\n\u000f\n)\n\n(Z, Y ) S\n\n(6.4)\n\nK(Z, i + 1) ,\n\nwhere \u03b7 is a homotopy between the map representing the relative integral class Vi+1 (Z, Y ) and the\nrelative cocycle \u03b1i+1 .\nRemarks. 1. As in previous defintions, such a twisted notion of Wu structure can be defined on\na brane M with the (by now) obvious changes.\n2. The condition for existence of a relative twisted Wuc structure of degree i is Vi+1 (Z, Y ) + \u03b1i+1 =\n0 \u2208 H i+1 (Z, Y ; Z).\nWith the above defintions and results, we now present our main application of relative twisted\nstructures.\n\nWuc\n\nExample 13. The M5-brane. Consider the worldvolume of the M5-brane as a 6-manifold\nM 6 . In the usual Chern-Simons construction, this is the base of a circle bundle Y 7 , which is a\nboundary of an 8-manifold Z 8 . The fields are considered to be cohomology classes of degree three\n(i.e. middle-degree) on M 6 which lift to degree four cohomology classes on Z 8 . In addition to the\nusual intersection pairing on M 6 , we have a torsion pairing on Y 7 . Let T 4 (Y 7 ) denote the torsion\nsubgroup of the integral cohomology group H 4 (Y 7 ; Z), and similarly let T 4 (Z 8 ) be the torsion\nsubgroup of H 4 (Z 8 ; Z). The torsion pairing is given by the symmetric bilinear nonsingular pairing\nL : T 4 (Y 7 ) \u00d7 T 4 (Y 7 ) \u2192 Q/Z .\n\n(6.5)\n\nLet i : T 4 (Z 8 ) \u2192 T 4 (Y 7 ) be the inclusion. This is the adjoint with respect to the pairing L of the\nmap \u03b4 : T 4 (Y 7 ) \u2192 T 5 (Z 8 , Y 7 ), that is L(i(x), y) = hx, \u03b4yi, where x \u2208 T 4 (Z 8 ) and y \u2208 T 4 (Y 7 ).\nA lifting v\u0302 \u2208 H 4 (Z 8 , Y 7 ; Z2 ) of the Wu class v4 \u2208 H 4 (Z 8 ; Z2 ) is said to be compatible with the\nquadratic form \u03c8 : T 4 (Y 7 ) \u2192 Q/Z if, for all x \u2208 T 4 (Y 7 ) such that x = i\u2217 (y), we have\n1\n1\n\u03c8(x) = hy * v\u03024 , [Z 8 , Y 7 ]i \u2212 hy * (j \u2217 )\u22121 y, [Z 8 , Y 7 ]i \u2208 Q/Z .\n2\n2\n\n(6.6)\n\nLet j \u2217 : H 4 (Z 8 , Y 7 ; Z) \u2192 H 4 (Z 8 ; Z) be the map induced from the map that forgets the boundary.\nGiven a quadratic function on T 4 (Y 7 ), there is a corresponding Wu class v\u03024 \u2208 H 4 (Z 8 , Y 7 ; Z2 ). Now\nlet b4 \u2208 T 4 (Y 7 ) be class such that \u03c8i(y) = L(b4 , i(y)) for all y \u2208 T 4 (Z 8 ). Then we have\n\u03b2v\u03024 = \u03b4\u2217 b4 ,\n\n(6.7)\n\nwhere \u03b2 : H 4 (Z 8 , Y 7 ; Z2 ) \u2192 H 5 (Z 8 , Y 7 ; Z) is the integral Bockstein and \u03b4\u2217 : H 4 (Y 7 ; Z) \u2192\nH 5 (Z 8 , Y 7 ; Z) is the coboundary map of the pair (Z 8 , Y 7 ).\nWe now interpret expression (6.7) as defining a twisted (relative) Wu(4)c structure.\n16\n\n\fThere exists an integral class v4\u2032 \u2208 H 4 (Z 8 ; Z) such that the mod 2 reduction is the absolute (i.e.\nnon-relative) Wu class \u03c12 (v4\u2032 ) = v4 \u2208 H 4 (Z 8 ; Z2 ) and i\u2217 (v4\u2032 ) = 2b4 \u2208 H 4 (Y 7 ; Z).\nConsider the Wu relation Sq(v) = w, where Sq is the total Steenrod square operation, v is the\ntotal Wu class and w is total Stiefel-Whitney class. The degree 4 component gives v4 = w4 + lower\ndegree classes. If we require these lower degrees to vanish, then the Wu class and the Stiefel-Whitney\nclass coincide in degree 4. Therefore, the above condition can be written as\n\u03b2w4 = \u03b4\u2217 b ,\n\n(6.8)\n\nwhich is of the form W5 \u2212 H5 = 0 (albeit in relative cohomology).\nExample 14. Type IIB string theory. The structure of type IIB string theory in ten dimensions, on M 10 , is in some ways very similar to that of the M5-brane. In particular, here we use for\nfields cohomology classes of degree five in ten dimensions which lift to cohomology classes of degree\nsix in twelve dimensions, on Z 12 with \u2202Z 12 = Y 11 . In this case, the above construction yields the\ncondition in degree seven\n\u03b2v\u03026 = \u03b4\u2217 b6 ,\n(6.9)\nwhere b6 \u2208 T 6 (Y 1 1) be class such that \u03c8i(y) = L(b6 , i(y)) for all y \u2208 T 6 (Z 12 ).\nWe now interpret expression (6.9) as defining a twisted (relative) Wu(6)c structure.\nThere exists an integral class v6\u2032 \u2208 H 6 (Z 12 ; Z) such that the mod 2 reduction is the absolute\n(i.e. non-relative) Wu class \u03c12 (v6\u2032 ) = v6 \u2208 H 6 (Z 12 ; Z2 ) and i\u2217 (v6\u2032 ) = 2b6 \u2208 H 6 (Y 11 ; Z).\nWe record the results of the above two examples in the following\nProposition 18 The lift of the Wu class vi in the sense of [3] gives rise to a twisted Membranec\nstructure and a twisted StringK(Z,3) structure on the 8-manifold and the 12-manifold for i = 4 and\ni = 8, respectively.\nExample 14 is also discussed in [22] in relation to global anomalies in type IIB string theory.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe author would like to thank IHES, Bures-sur-Yvette, for kind hospitality and inspiring\natmosphere during the writing of this paper.
