It is central to much of modern astrophysics, with\nimplications ranging from cosmic re-ionisation and the formation of the first galaxies, over the evolution and structure\nof our own Milky Way, down to the build-up of planets and\nplanetary systems.\nNear the Sun the number density of stars as a function of mass has a peak at a characteristic stellar mass of a\nfew tenths of a solar mass, below which it declines steeply,\nand for masses above one solar mass it follows a power-law\nwith an exponent dN/dlogm \u221d m\u22121.3 . Within a radius of\nseveral kpc this distribution shows surprisingly little variation (Salpeter 1955; Scalo 1998; Kroupa 2001; Kroupa 2002;\nChabrier 2003). This has prompted the suggestion that the\ndistribution of stellar masses at birth is a truly universal\nfunction, which often is referred to as the Salpeter IMF, although note that the original Salpeter (1955) estimate was\na pure power-law fit without characteristic mass scale.\nOn the other hand, there is increasing evidence that the\n\nIMF close to the centre of our Milky Way (Stolte et al. 2002,\n2005, Nayakshin & Sunyaev 2005, Paumard et al. 2006) and\nthe neighboring Andromeda galaxy (Bender et al. 2005) is\ndominated by massive rather than low-mass stars. For the\ncircum-nuclear starburst regions in more distant galaxies,\nvery similar IMF deviations are subject to continuing debate\n(e.g., Scalo 1990, Elmegreen 2005). However, no conclusion\nhas yet been reached, and it appears timely to examine the\nproblem from a theoretical point of view.\nWe approach the problem by means of self-consistent\nhydrodynamical calculations of fragmentation and star formation in interstellar gas where chemical and thermodynamical properties are described by a realistic equation of\nstate (EOS). We focus on the most extreme environmental\nconditions such as occur in the nuclear regions of massive\nstar-forming spiral galaxies. There the inferred dust and gas\ntemperatures, gas densities and star formation rates typically exceed the solar-neighborhood values by factors of 3,\n10 and \u2265 100, respectively (e.g. Ott et al. 2005; Israel 2005;\nAalto et al. 2002; Spinoglio et al. 2002). Consequently, it has\nlong been speculated that such conditions lead to deviations\nfrom the Salpeter IMF (e.g., Scalo 1990, Elmegreen 2005).\n\n\f2\n\nKlessen, Spaans, & Jappsen\n\nFigure 1. Column density distribution of the gas projected along the three principal axes of the system after 3.5 million years of evolution\nwhen 15% of the gas is converted into protostars (sink particles). Their location is indicated by black dots.\n\n2\n\nMODEL\n\nStars and star clusters form through the interplay between\nself-gravity on the one side and turbulence, magnetic fields,\nand thermal pressure on the other (for recent reviews see\nLarson 2003; Mac Low & Klessen 2004; Ballesteros-Paredes\net al. 2006). The supersonic turbulence ubiquitously observed in interstellar gas clouds can create strong density\nfluctuations with gravity taking over in the densest and most\nmassive regions. Collapse sets in to build up stars and star\nclusters. Turbulence plays a dual role. On global scales it\nprovides support, on local scales it provokes collapse. Stellar birth is thus intimately linked to the dynamic behavior\nof the parental gas cloud, which governs when and where\nstar formation sets in (as illustrated in Figure 1).\nThe chemical and thermodynamic properties of interstellar clouds play a key role in this process. In particular,\nthe value of the polytropic exponent \u03b3, when adopting an\nEOS of the form P \u221d \u03c1\u03b3 , strongly influences the compressibility of density condensations as well as the temperature\nof the gas. The EOS thus determines the amount of clump\nfragmentation, and so directly relates to the IMF (V\u00e1zquezSemadeni et al. 1996) with values of \u03b3 larger than unity leading to little fragmentation and high mass cores (Li, Klessen,\n& Mac Low 2003; Jappsen et al. 2005). The stiffness of the\nEOS in turn depends strongly on the ambient metallicity,\ndensity and infrared background radiation field produced by\nwarm dust grains. The EOS thus varies considerably in different galactic environments (see Spaans & Silk 2000, 2005\nfor a detailed account).\nFor the circum-nuclear starburst regions that are the\nsubject here we assume a cosmic ray ionisation rate of\n3 \u00d7 10\u221215 s\u22121 , solar relative abundances (Asplund et al.\n2004; Jenkins 2004) and an overall metallicity of two times\nsolar (Barthel 2005). A velocity dispersion \u2206Vtur = 5 km/s\nis adopted to take the larger input of kinetic energy (e.g.\nthrough supernovae) into account. The dust temperature inside the model clouds is set by a fiducial background star formation rate of 100 M\u2299 yr\u22121 /kpc2 which causes dust grains\nto be at temperatures of about Td = 30 \u2212 90 K, depending\non the amount of shielding. Gas temperatures range from\nTg = 40 \u2212 140 K, over a density range of 104 \u2212 107 cm\u22123 .\nThese values are consistent with gas and dust temperatures\ndetermined for circum-nuclear starburst regions (Klaas et\n\nFigure 2. Starburst EOS adopted from Spaans & Silk (2005).\n\nal. 1997; Aalto et al. 2002; Spinoglio et al. 2002; Ott et al.\n2005; Israel 2005).\nFigure 2 shows the resulting polytropic exponent as a\nfunction of density. The main feature is the \u03b3 > 1 peak\naround n = 104 cm3 . This peak implies that the gas warms\nup as it is compressed and it is caused mainly by strong photon trapping in opaque H2 O and CO lines in the metal-rich\nnuclear gas. That is, the large optical depth in the cooling lines suppresses the cooling efficiency. Also, warm dust\n(T > 40 K), heated by the ambient stars, causes H2 O collisional de-excitation heating through far-infrared pumping\n(Takahashi, Hollenbach & Silk, 1983; Spaans & Silk 2005),\nwhich adds to the gas-dust heating. Cosmic-ray heating rate\nis elevated by a high supernova rate, as expected for nuclear\nstarburst regions (Bradford et al. 2003).\nAdopting this EOS we follow the dynamical evolution\nof the star-forming gas using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). This is a Lagrangian method to solve the\nequations of hydrodynamics, where the fluid is represented\nby an ensemble of particles, and flow quantities are obtained\nby averaging over an appropriate subset of SPH particles\n(Monaghan 2005). The method is able to resolve high density contrasts as particles are free to move, and so the particle concentration increases naturally in high-density regions.\n\n\fIMF in the Galactic Centre and Starburst Regions\nThe performance and convergence properties of SPH are well\nunderstood and tested against analytic models and other numerical schemes in the context of astrophysical flows (see,\ne.g., Mac Low et al. 1998; Lombardi et al. 1999; Klessen et\nal. 2000; O'Shea et al. 2005; Ballesteros-Paredes et al. 2006).\nArtificial fragmentation can be ruled out, as long as the mass\nwithin one smoothing volume remains less than half the critical mass for gravitational collapse (Bate & Burkert 1997;\nHubber, Goodwin, & Whitworth 2005). We use the publically available parallel code GADGET (Springel et al. 2001).\nIt is modified to replace high-density cores with sink particles (Bate, Bonnell, & Price 1995) that can accrete gas from\ntheir surroundings while keeping track of mass and momentum. This enables us to follow the dynamic evolution of the\nsystem over many local free-fall timescales. We identify sink\nparticles as the direct progenitors of individual stars. For a\nmore detailed account of the method and a discussion of its\nconvergence properties we refer the reader to Klessen et al.\n(2000) and Jappsen et al. (2005).\nWe focus on a cubic volume of 11.2 pc in size, which\ncontains 80, 000 M\u2299 of gas and has an initial mean particle\ndensity n = 103 cm3 at a temperature of 21 K. Above the\ncharacteristic density n = 104 cm\u22123 where \u03b3 is at a maximum, the temperature quickly reaches values of \u223c 100 K.\nThis set-up is chosen to describe the typical environment\nwithin the central regions of an actively star-forming galaxy\nsuch as our own Milky Way or NGC 253. In such galaxies,\nhigh-density gas with n > 105 cm\u22123 , as traced by HCN,\ntypically has a filamentary structure with very low filling\nfactor, while the bulk of the gas is at n \u2248 103 cm\u22123 (Morris & Serabyn 1996; H\u00fcttemeister et al. 1993; Israel & Baas\n2003), exactly as found at the end of our simulation (see\nFigure 1). We stop the calculation at a star formation efficiency SFE \u2248 15%, when roughly 1/6 of the total gas mass\nhas turned into gravitationally collapsed condensations (i.e.\nsink particles, which we identify as direct progenitors of individual young stars). Throughout the simulation we drive\nturbulence continuously on large scales, with wave numbers\nk in the range 1 \u2264 k \u2264 2 (see Mac Low 1999) to yield a\nconstant turbulent Mach number Mrms \u2248 5. The particle\nnumber is N = 8 000 000. This is thus one of the highestresolution star-formation calculations done with SPH, with\na total CPU time of 8 \u00d7 104 hours. The critical density for\nsink particle formation is nc = 107 cm\u22123 , with a sink particle radius of 0.015 pc. The mass of individual SPH particles\nis m = 0.01 M\u2299 , which is sufficient to resolve the minimum\nJeans mass in the system MJ \u2248 1.5 M\u2299 . Except for the EOS\nand the particle number, the numerical set-up is identical to\nthe study by Jappsen et al. (2005). We have performed a\nsecond run for a region of 5.7 pc with 4 times less mass,\neight times fewer particles and a sink particle radius of 0.02\npc that has reached a SFE \u223c 36%.\n\n3\n\nRESULT AND PHYSICAL\nINTERPRETATION\n\nWe find that in the considered star-forming region, the mass\nspectrum of collapsed objects is biased towards high masses.\nThe resulting IMF has a broad peak at \u223c 15 M\u2299 followed by\nan approximate power-law fall-off with a slope in the range\n-1.0 to -1.3. Furthermore, there is a clear deficit of stars be-\n\n3\n\nlow 7 M\u2299 . This is illustrated in Figure 3a. We contrast this\nfinding with the result from a simulation appropriate for\nthe physical conditions in star forming regions near the Sun\n(from Jappsen et al. 2005), where \u03b3 changes from 0.7 to 1.1\nat an H2 density of a few \u00d7105 cm\u22123 . As expected, Figure\n3b shows a mass spectrum that is very similar to the IMF\nin the solar neighborhood (Kroupa 2002; Chabrier 2003).\nThese striking differences are caused by the very disparate\nchemical and thermodynamic state of the star forming gas\nin the two simulations, since all other parameters are very\nsimilar. Our results thus support the hypothesis that for extreme environmental conditions as inferred for the centres of\nmost spiral galaxies or more general for IR-luminous circumnuclear starburst regions the IMF is indeed expected to be\ntop-heavy.\nThere is a natural explanation for our results in terms\nof the temperature dependence of the Jeans mass MJ . Compared to a mean temperature of 10 K for dense molecular\ngas in the Milky Way, gravitationally collapsing gas in our\nsimulations has a temperature of \u223c 100 K and an H2 density\nof a few \u00d7105 cm\u22123 . As the critical mass for gravitational\ncollapse scales as MJ \u221d T 1.5 , this boosts MJ from 0.3 M\u2299\nat 10 K to about 10 M\u2299 at 100 K (see also Klessen & Burkert 2000, Bonnell, Clarke, & Bate 2006). This temperature\nmay seem high, but is quite consistent with molecular cloud\nobservations in the Galactic centre (e.g. H\u00fcttemeister et al.\n1993) or with high-density (n > 104 cm\u22123 ) NH3 data in the\nstarburst centre of NGC253 (Ott et al. 2005). We also note,\nthat this Jeans mass scaling argument is supported by recent\nobservations in more nearby high-mass star-forming regions.\nFor example, in M17 at a distance of 1.6 kpc from the Sun,\nthe mass spectrum of prestellar cores, which are the direct\nprogenitors of individual stars, peaks at at \u223c 4 M\u2299 at an\nambient temperature of 30 K (Reid & Wilson 2006). This is\nwell above the corresponding peak in low-mass star-forming\nregions (e.g. Motte, Andr\u00e9, & Neri 1998).\n\n4\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nOur mass spectrum is in good agreement with the IMF estimates in the Galactic centre by Stolte et al. (2002, 2005),\nNayakshin et al. (2005), and Paumard et al. (2006). For example, Stolte et al. (2002, 2005) find for the Arches cluster\na clear deficit of stars below 7 M\u2299 . This is consistent with\nour result in the sense that the ambient densities and temperatures found in the Galactic centre are similarly elevated\n(Helfer & Blitz 1996) as in the circum-nuclear starburst environment we consider. We stress that the turn-down in our\nmodel IMF at masses below 10 M\u2299 is a direct consequence of\nthe stiff EOS for densities n above a few\u00d7103 cm\u22123 through\nthe Jeans mass temperature dependence, and is not caused\nby resolution effects. Our two simulations resolve masses\ndown to \u223c 2 M\u2299 and \u223c 1 M\u2299 , respectively, and our least\nmassive stars (i.e. sink particles) are well above this limit.\nRather, the effective Jeans mass at T \u223c 100K and densities\nof \u223c 105 \u2212106 cm\u22123 prevent the formation of low-mass stars.\nWhen interpreting our simulation results, there are several caveats that need to be kept in mind. First, our numerical model does not include shear. Strong shear motions\nmay mimic the EOS effects discussed here, as shear adds\nstability and thus requires larger Jeans masses for collapse\n\n\f4\n\nKlessen, Spaans, & Jappsen\n\nFigure 3. (a) Mass spectrum of gravitational condensations in the starburst calculation at a time when 15% of the gas is converted into\ncollapsed objects (which we identify as direct progenitors of individual stars). To guide the eye, we indicate a slope -1.0 and the Salpeter\nslope -1.3 with dotted lines. The mass function in our simulated starburst environment shows a broad peak in the range 10 M\u2299 \u2212 25 M\u2299\nand falls off for larger masses. It is thus top-heavy compared to the IMF in the solar neighborhood (Salpeter 1955; Kroupa 2002; Chabrier\n2003). (b) Mass spectrum of collapsed objects in a calculation focusing on nearby molecular clouds (see Jappsen et al. 2005). It agrees\nwell with the IMF in the solar vicinity. For comparison we overplot the functional forms proposed by Kroupa (2002) with dashed lines\nand by Chabrier (2003) with dotted lines. Our two calculations differ mainly in the adopted EOS, i.e. in the chemical and thermodynamic\nstate of the star forming gas, other parameters are comparable.\n\nto occur. However, the Arches cluster is bound. Thus the\nGalactic centre shear field cannot play a dominant role in\nthe inner parts of the cluster. Second, our numerical model\ndoes not take the effects of magnetic fields into account,\nwhich may be of considerable strength in the Galactic centre (Yusef-Zadeh & Morris 1987, but also see Roy 2004 for\nlower estimates). However, even if there is a rough equipartition between kinetic and magnetic energy, the chemical\nand thermodynamic properties of the gas are not strongly\naffected. Our results will still hold at least qualitatively, in\nthe sense that an extreme environment leads to deviatiations\nfrom the standard Salpeter IMF. Third, the use of sink particles does not permit us to resolve close binary systems.\nMassive stars in the solar vicinity are almost always members of a binary or higher-order multiple stellar system (e.g.\nVanbeveren et al. 1998). If this trend holds also for starburst\nenvironments, then the peak of the stellar IMF will lie below\nthe value reported here. For instance, if each unresolved sink\nparticle in our calculation separates into a binary star, in a\nstatistical sense our mass spectrum needs to be shifted to\nlower masses by a factor of 0.5. Finally, protostellar feedback\nmay locally affect the accretion onto individual protostars.\nIn this case the mass content of the sink particle may only\npoorly reflect the mass that ends up in a star. However, even\nin the extreme case that half the mass is removed by feedback during collapse (for estimates, see Yorke & Sonnhalter\n2002; Krumholz, McKee, & Klein 2005), deviations from the\nstandard IMF will still persist.\nFor typical molecular clouds in the Milky less than a\nfew percent of their mass takes part in star formation (e.g.\nMyers et al. 1986) and this fraction goes up by a factor of\na few for cluster-forming cores (e.g. Lada & Lada 2003).\nA number of observations (Paglione et al. 1997; Mooney &\nSolomon 1988) indicate that starburst systems like NGC253\nand M82, and luminous infrared galaxies in general, have a\n\nlarger fraction of their interstellar gas mass at high densities\n(Gao & Solomon 2004). Consequently, their SFE's are up by\nas much as an order of magnitude. Our simulations cover this\nrange and the statistics of our mass spectra do not change\nabove a SFE \u223c 10% in both runs. Hence, the precise SFE\nthat pertains to a starburst environment does not influence\nour results as long as it is larger than 10%.\nThe computed star formation rate (SFR), defined as the\nchange in mass with time of the sink particles, is typically\n860 M\u2299 yr\u22121 /kpc2 for a SFE > 10% and when normalised\nto a surface area of 1 kpc2 , which is roughly the size scale\nof the nuclear region inside a starburst galaxy. This number\nlies well within the fiducial range of 50 \u2212 1000 M\u2299 yr\u22121 /kpc2\ninferred for most starburst systems (e.g. Kennicutt 1998,\nScoville & Wilson 2004).\nWhen turning to distant starburst galaxies in the early\nuniverse, the low-mass cut-off at 7 M\u2299 seen in the simulated\nlocal starburst region seems at first glance difficult to reconcile with the mass-to-light ratio and the stellar population\nsynthesis models inferred from global observations (Kaufmann et al. 2003). However, we emphasise again, that we are\nfocusing on an extreme case and on a clearly localised, isolated region only. In reality these extreme (warm and dusty)\nenvironmental conditions will not apply to all regions inside a starburst galaxy. There will be pockets of colder gas\nwith different (\u03b3 < 1) EOS that are less exposed to radiation (Spaans & Silk 2000) and that behave like Galactic\nstar-forming regions. Under these conditions the studies by\nJappsen et al. (2005) and Larson (2005) indicate that a normal, Salpeter-like IMF results. This also suggests that the\nrelative contribution of the extreme IMF found in this work\ncan be connected directly to the observations. The fraction\nof molecular gas at densities > 104 cm\u22123 that enjoys temperatures larger than 50 K should be a strong indicator of\ndeviations from a Salpeter IMF. Future work will address\n\n\fIMF in the Galactic Centre and Starburst Regions\nthe issue of stellar population matching and will compare\nour results with observed M/L ratios and warm, high density gas mass estimates.\n\nREFERENCES\nAalto, S., Polatidis, A.G., H\u00fcttemeister, S., Curran, S.J., 2002,\nA&A, 381, 783\nAsplund, M., Grevesse, N., & Sauval, J., 2005, in Cosmic Abundances as Records of Stellar Evolution and Nucleosynthesis,\neds.
