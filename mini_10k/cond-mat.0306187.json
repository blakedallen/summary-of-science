In this regime, the Feshbach resonance is unshifted. By sweeping across the resonance,\na thermal distribution of bound states (molecules) can be reversibly generated. Throughout this\nprocess, the interaction energy is negative and continuous. We also show that this behavior must\npersist at lower temperatures unless there is a phase transition as the temperature is lowered. We\nrigorously demonstrate universal behavior near the resonance.\nPACS numbers: 03.75.-b,03.75.Ss,34.50.-s\n\nAt present, much experimental activity is concentrated\non degenerate quantum gases near a Feshbach resonance\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] where the nominally weak effective interactions are strongly enhanced. By applying a magnetic\nfield, which moves the energy of a bound molecular state\nrelative to the scattering continuum, the interactions can\nbe tuned by by many orders of magnitude. The scattering length diverges to negative/positive infinity when the\nmolecular energy is infinitesmally above/below threshold.\nAt resonance, the scattering cross-section is limited only\nby unitarity (\u03c3 = 4\u03c0/k 2 , where k is the relative momentum of the two atoms) and is universal (independent of\nthe microscopic physics). The universal nature of the unitarity limit leads to a challenging many-body problem,\nsince there are no small parameters readily identifiable\nfor the application of perturbation theory.\nRecently, a sequence of beautiful experiments on Fermi\ngases have found unexpected and dramatic behavior near\nunitarity; including a universal interaction energy [1, 2]\nand the reversible interconversion of atoms and molecules\n[4]. The former demonstrates the effects of unitary scattering on bulk properties, and the latter suggests the possibility of an equilibrium phase with atoms and molecules\nin chemical equilibrium. Several of the experimental results are not well understood, and some even appear to\nbe mutually contradictory [2]. In the following, we shall\nsummarize these experiments and the fundamental questions which they raise. We refer to the range of magnetic\nfields on either side of the resonance where the scattering length asc is positive or negative as the \"+'ve\" and\n\"\u2212've\" side of the resonance.\n(I) Universal interaction energy: Thomas's group at\nDuke [1] has studied a gas containing two spin states\nof fermionic 6 Li (which has a Feshbach resonance around\n855 Gauss). The experiment is performed on the negative side at 910 Gauss. Upon release from the trap, the\nFermi gas undergoes anisotropic expansion for temperatures between 0.1 and 3.5 TF . This anisotropy can be\nexplained by collisional hydrodynamics with a universal\ninteraction energy proportional to the Fermi energy EF .\n\n(II) Properties near resonance: More recently, Salomon's\ngroup directly measured the interaction energy of the\nsame 6 Li system, at temperatures between 0.5 and 1 TF .\n(a) Crossing the resonance from the negative side, they\nfind that the interaction energy \u01ebint remains negative and\ncontinuous across the resonance, despite the expected infinite jump of the scattering length. They find an interaction energy similar to that of the Duke group, convincingly demonstrating that \u01ebint remains roughly constant\nover the temperature range 0.1TF to TF . (b) Approaching the resonance from the opposite side, \u01ebint is positive\nbut drops to a negative value at a field of 700G; roughly\n150G before the resonance is reached. (c) The threebody recombination rate is maximal at 700 Gauss, rather\nthan at 855 G; a result consistent with the work of Ketterle's group at MIT [3]. (d) The anisotropy of the expansion (which is a measure of the interaction strength),\nis maximal at 855 G. While (a) through (c) seem to indicate that the resonance is shifted from 855 G to 700 G by\nmany-body effects; (d) is consistent with an un-shifted\nresonance.\n(III) Conversion between atoms and molecules: Very recently, Jin's group at JILA has studied a gas consisting\nof two spin states of fermionic 40 K [4]. They show that\nmolecules are produced as one crosses the resonance from\nthe \u2212've to the +'ve side. Moreover, this process is reversible. This experiment, performed at T = 0.1TF finds\nno significant shift of the original resonance.\nHere, we focus on the Fermi gas near a Feshbach resonance. Far from resonance, the interaction energy is\n\u01ebint = gn\u2191 n\u2193 , where g = 4\u03c0h\u03042 asc /M , n\u2191 and n\u2193 are the\nnumber densities of the two spin components. (We shall\nconsider the case n\u2191 = n\u2193 = n/2.) A key question is how\nthis non-universal form of \u01ebint turns into a universal function near resonance, (see (I) and (II)). Moreover, how\ndoes this function reflect the existence of molecules and\nwhat signatures do these molecules have if they exist?\nEqually important is whether the original resonance is\nshifted in a many-body medium, (see (II)). To use methods where errors can be estimated precisely, we consider\n\n\f2\nthe Boltzmann regime. In this case, physical quantities\ncan be calculated systematically through a high temperature series expansion; and yet the issues of the emergence\nof universal behaviors at unitarity still remain.\nOne might wonder whether the phenomena in the\nBoltzmann regime have any relevance to current ultralow\ntemperature experiments. The connection is simply that\nin the absence of any phase transition in the normal state,\nthe thermodynamic functions in the Boltzmann regime\nare analytically continuations (in T and n) of those in the\ndegenerate regime. This analytic continuation imposes\nstrong constraints on the phase diagram, allowing one to\nqualitatively understand the physics at all temperatures.\nIn fact, apart from a difference in scale, the exact results in Boltzmann regime show all of the features discovered in experiments (I), (II), and (III). Surprisingly, the\nhigh temperature results, which should work\u221awell when\nn\u2191 \u03bb3 = n\u2193 \u03bb3 = n\u03bb3 /2 \u226a 1 (where \u03bb = h/ 2\u03c0M kB T\nis the thermal wavelength and kB is Boltzmann's constant,) agrees reasonably well with\n\u221a the ENS experiments\n[2] performed at n\u03bb3 /2 = (4/3 \u03c0)(TF /T )3/2 \u223c 1.6 (see\npoint (E), later). In the following, we derive the interaction energy density in the Boltzmann regime, then draw\na series of conclusions labeled below as (A) to (D).\nEnergy density in the Boltzmann regime: At\nhigh temperatures, or low densities, the grand partition function Z = Tre\u2212(H\u2212\u03bcN )/kB T can be expanded\nin the fugacity z = e\u03bc/kB T [6, 7]; and to the second order in z, \u221a\nwhere interaction\neffects first appear,\n\u0001\nis Z = Z (o) + 2 2 V z 2 /\u03bb3 b2 , where the superscript\n\"o\" denotes quantities for non-interacting systems, and\nP\n(2)\n(2) (o)\nb2 = \u03bd (e\u2212\u03b2E\u03bd \u2212 e\u2212\u03b2[E\u03bd ] ) is the second virial coefficient,\nX\nX Z \u221e dk d\u03b4l (k) \u2212 h\u03042 k2\n|Eb |/kB T\nb2 =\ne mkB T , (1)\ne\n+\n\u03b3l\n\u03c0 dk\n0\nb\n\nl\n\nwhere \u03b3l = 2l + 1, the sum is over all integers l = 0, 1, ..,\nEb is the energy of the two body bound state, and \u03b4l (k)\nis the phase shift of the l-th partial wave[8].\nA standard thermodynamic calculation [9] shows that,\nto lowest nontrivial order in n\u03bb3 , the energy density is\n\u0013\n\u0012\nn\u03bb3\n3nkB T\n(2)\n1 + 7/2 + \u01ebint \u2261 \u01ebkin + \u01ebint\n\u01eb=\n2\n2\nwhere \u01ebkin and \u01ebint are respectively the kinetic and interaction energy densities;\n#\n\"\n\u221a\n\u0001\n3kB T n\n2\nb\n\u2202b\n2\n2\n\u01ebint =\n.\n(3)\nn\u03bb3 \u2212 \u221a +\nT\n2\n3 \u2202T\n2\nSince the contributions of the partial waves with l \u2265 1 in\neq. (1) are smaller than those of the s-wave by a factor\nn\u03bb3 , we shall ignore them in our subsequent discussions.\nFar from resonance the phase shift is \u03b4(k) = \u2212asc k for\nsmall k. Due to the Gaussian cutoff in eq. (1), no errors\n\nare made by using this expression for all k. In the\n\u221a absence\nof bound states, we then have b2 = \u2212asc /( 2\u03bb), and\nhence T \u2202b2 /\u2202T = b2 /2. Equation (3) then reduces to\nthe usual expression \u01ebint = gn\u2191 n\u2193 , with n\u2191 = n\u2193 = n/2.\nEnergy levels and interaction energy : To evaluate \u01ebint near Feshbach resonance we use the expression\nfor the phase shift valid for k << b\u22121 , where b is the\nrange of the potential[10]\nkcot \u03b4(k) = \u2212\n\n1\nro k 2\n+\n,\nasc\n2\n\n(4)\n\nwhere ro (\u223c b) is the effective range and asc is the s-wave\nscattering length. As\n\u0011 of magnetic field, asc\n\u0010 a function\n\u2206B\n, where B0 and \u2206B are\nvaries as asc = abg 1 \u2212 B\u2212B\no\nthe location and the width of the resonance, and abg is\nthe background scattering length away from resonance.\nThe region B > B0 and B < B0 where asc < 0 and\n> 0 are referred to as the \"\u2212've\" and \"+'ve\" side of\nthe resonance. For temperature range such that thermal\nwavelength is larger than the range of the potential, \u03bb >\nb, we can use eq.(4) in eq.(1) where the integral is cutoff\nat \u03bb\u22121 . Near resonance, \u03bb/asc , ro /asc \u2192 0, and eqs.(1)\nand (4) imply that up to terms of order ro /asc ,\nX\n2\nsgn(asc )\nb2 =\n(1 \u2212 erf(x)) ex ,\n(5)\ne|Eb |/kB T \u2212\n2\nb\n\u221a\nwhere x = \u03bb/( 2\u03c0asc ), and erf(x) is the error function.\nWe can then evaluate \u01ebint using eq.(3) and (5). At the\nsame time, it is useful to look at the effect of phase shifts\non the energy levels. In a box of size R, the wavevector\nk is changed from its non-interacting value ko = l\u03c0/R\n(l = 1, 2, 3..) to k \u223c ko \u2212 \u03b4(ko )/R through the boundary\ncondition sin(kR + \u03b4(k)) = 0 at a large distance R. Scattering states and bound states correspond to real and\nimaginary k solution of this boundary condition. The\nenergies of lowest few states in the center of mass frame\n(E = h\u03042 k 2 /M ) are shown in fig. 1. As one passes through\nthe resonance from the \u2212've side, the lowest state in the\ncontinuum turns into a bound state, causing \u03b4(k = 0) to\nchange abruptly from 0 to \u03c0. The corresponding interaction energy \u01ebint calculated from eq.(3) and eq.(5) are\nshown in fig. 2.

Equation (6)\nin turn implies that in a bulk system, the original resonance (at field B0 ) can not be shifted to the positive side\n(to B1 < B0 ) at a lower temperature unless there is a\nphase transition for all magnetic fields between B1 and\nB0 where hnb i disappears as temperature is lowered from\nthe Boltzman regime. (See fig. 3). So far, such a phase\ntransition has not been observed. Should future experiments rule out such a transition in 6 Li, one must then\nconclude that the resonance in the ENS experiment[2] is\nnot shifted. The absence of a shift of the resonance is\nalso consistent with the findings in ref. [4] for 40 K.\n(C) Approaching the resonance from the +'ve side; if the\nbound states are not occupied, \u01ebint will follow a \"positive\n(+)\nbranch\" \u01ebint > 0 which increases monotonically, evolving\nfrom gn\u2191 n\u2193 to \u01eb0 = (3nkB T /2)(n\u03bb3 /23/2 ) at resonance\n(see fig. 2). However, a gas containing only scattering\nstates is not in true equilibrium, as the latter requires\nthat all states, including bound states, are thermally populated.

Because the original\nresonance (B0 ) is un-shifted at high temperature, a shift in\nresonance at low temperature (B1 < B0 ) will imply a phase\nboundary as shown in (a), which means that hnb i will disappear (or appear) as temperature is lowered (or raised) along\nthe path indicated by the double-headed arrow. The phase\ndiagram for an unshifted resonance is shown in (b).\n\ncan only lead to chemical equilibrium if the released energy is insufficient to eject the particles from the trap.\nIf one is sufficiently far from the resonance, then the\nmolecular binding energy is larger than the trap depth,\nand the three-body collisions instead lead to loss. The\nsudden drop in the interaction energy near 700G in the\nENS experiment [2] is consistent with the production of\ntrapped molecules. Moreover, Jochim et al. [5] have directly observed the equilibration of atom/molecule populations near this field. This scenario also predicts that\nthe development of an equilibrium molecular population\nwill coincide with a peak in the three body loss rate. This\npeak is observed at ENS [2], MIT [3], and Innsbruck [5].\n(\u2212)\n(D) The extension of \u01ebint to the positive side of the\nresonance is due to the population of the bound state\nwhich becomes available there.
