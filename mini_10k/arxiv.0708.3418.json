Introduction\nLet Q = (Q0 , Q1 ) be a quiver, consisting of a finite set of vertices Q0 and a\nfinite set of arrows Q1 . Each arrow a \u2208 Q1 has a head h(a) and a tail t(a) in\nQ0 . For convenience we will assume that the vertex set is an integer interval,\nQ0 = {1, 2, . . . , n}. Let e = (e1 , . . . , en ) \u2208 Nn be a dimension vector, and fix vector\nspaces Ei = Kei for i \u2208 Q0 over a field\nL K. The representations of Q on these vector\nspaces form the affine space V =\na\u2208Q1 Hom(Et(a) , Eh(a) ), which has a natural\naction of the group G = GL(E1 ) \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 GL(En ) given by (g1 , . . . , gn ).(\u03c6a )a\u2208Q1 =\n\u22121\n(gh(a) \u03c6a gt(a)\n)a\u2208Q1 .\nDefine a quiver cycle to be any G-stable closed irreducible subvariety \u03a9 in V . A\nquiver cycle determines an equivariant (Chow) cohomology class [\u03a9] \u2208 HG\u2217 (V ) and\nan equivariant Grothendieck class [O\u03a9 ] \u2208 KG (V ). These classes are well understood\nwhen the quiver Q is equioriented of type A, that is, a sequence {1 \u2192 2 \u2192 * * * \u2192 n}\nof arrows in the same direction. In this case, a formula for the cohomology class\n[\u03a9] was given in joint work with Fulton [11], and this formula was generalized to\nK-theory in [8]. The K-theory formula states that the Grothendieck class [O\u03a9 ] is\ngiven by\nX\n[O\u03a9 ] =\nc\u03bc (\u03a9) G\u03bc1 (E2 \u2212 E1 )G\u03bc2 (E3 \u2212 E2 ) * * * G\u03bcn\u22121 (En \u2212 En\u22121 ) \u2208 KG (V )\n\u03bc\n\nwhere the sum is over finitely many sequences \u03bc = (\u03bc1 , . . . , \u03bcn\u22121 ) of partitions\n\u03bci . Each factor G\u03bci (Ei+1 \u2212 Ei ) is obtained by applying the stable Grothendieck\npolynomial for \u03bci to the standard representations of G on Ei+1 and Ei . This\nnotation will be explained in section 3.\nThe coefficients c\u03bc (\u03a9) are interesting geometric and combinatorial invariants\ncalled (equioriented)\nquiver coefficients. They are integers and are non-zero only\nP\nwhen the sum\n|\u03bci | of the weights of the partitions is greater than or equal to\nthe codimension of \u03a9. The coefficients for which this sum equals codim(\u03a9) describe the cohomology class of \u03a9 and are called cohomological quiver coefficients.\nIt was proved in [25] that cohomological quiver coefficients are non-negative, and\nin [10, 29] that the more general\nK-theoretic quiver coefficients have alternating\nP\nsigns, in the sense that (\u22121) |\u03bci |\u2212codim(\u03a9) c\u03bc (\u03a9) is a non-negative integer. These\nproperties had earlier been conjectured in [11, 8], and special cases had been proved\nin [6, 13, 14]. The equioriented quiver coefficients can furthermore be expressed in\nterms of counting factor sequences [11, 6, 25, 10, 12]. They are known to generalize Littlewood-Richardson coefficients [11], (K-theoretic) Stanley coefficients [7, 8],\nand the monomial coefficients of Schubert and Grothendieck polynomials [13, 14].\nDate: March 17, 2007; Revised August 21, 2007.\nThe author was partially supported by NSF Grant DMS-0603822.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nANDERS SKOVSTED BUCH\n\nThe equioriented quiver coefficients are themselves special cases of the K-theoretic\nSchubert structure constants on flag manifolds [28, 10, 16].\nThe purpose of this paper is to introduce and study a more general notion of\nquiver coefficients, which can be defined for an L\narbitrary quiver Q without oriented\nloops. For each vertex i \u2208 Q0 , we define Mi = a:h(a)=i Et(a) to be the direct sum\nof all vertex vector spaces at the tails of arrows pointing to i. (If there are two or\nmore arrows to i from a vertex j, then Ej is included multiple times as a summand\nof Mi .) Given a quiver cycle \u03a9 \u2282 V , we show that there are unique coefficients\nc\u03bc (\u03a9) \u2208 Z, indexed by sequences \u03bc = (\u03bc1 , . . . , \u03bcn ) of partitions such that the length\nl(\u03bci ) is at most ei , for which\nX\n(1)\n[O\u03a9 ] =\nc\u03bc (\u03a9) G\u03bc1 (E1 \u2212 M1 )G\u03bc2 (E2 \u2212 M2 ) * * * G\u03bcn (En \u2212 Mn ) .\n\u03bc\n\nP\nAs in the equioriented case, a coefficient c\u03bc (\u03a9) can be non-zero only if\n|\u03bci | \u2265\ncodim(\u03a9), and the lowest degree coefficients describe the cohomology class [\u03a9].\nHowever, the defining linear combination (1) might possibly be infinite, which makes\nsense modulo the gamma filtration on KG (V ). We pose the following.\n\nConjecture 1.1. Let Q be a quiver without oriented loops and \u03a9 \u2282 V a quiver\ncycle.\n(a) Only finitely many of the quiver coefficients c\u03bc (\u03a9) for \u03a9 are non-zero. In\nother words, the sum (1) is finite.\nP\n(b) All cohomological quiver coefficients c\u03bc (\u03a9), with\n|\u03bci | = codim(\u03a9), are\nnon-negative.\n(c) If \u03a9 has rationalP singularities, then the quiver coefficients for \u03a9 have alternating signs, i.e. (\u22121) |\u03bci |\u2212codim(\u03a9) c\u03bc (\u03a9) \u2265 0.\nOur main result is a formula for the quiver coefficients when the quiver Q is of\nDynkin type and \u03a9 has rational singularities. A quiver is of Dynkin type if the underlying (un-directed) graph is a simply-laced Dynkin diagram, i.e. a disjoint union\nof Dynkin diagrams of types A, D, and E. In this case, every quiver cycle is an orbit\nclosure [22]. Bobi\u0144ski and Zwara have proved that all orbit closures have rational\nsingularities if Q is a quiver of type A and K is an algebraically closed field [1], or\nif Q is of type D and K is algebraically closed of characteristic zero [2] (see also [27]\nfor the equioriented case). Our formula relies on an explicit desingularization of an\norbit closure given by Reineke [31], as well as a list of geometric and combinatorial\nproperties of stable Grothendieck polynomials established in [9, 8], and it proves\nthe finiteness part (a) of Conjecture 1.1. Our new formula generalizes the formula\nfor equioriented quiver coefficients proved in [8], but requires more operations on\nGrothendieck polynomials, including multiplication and Grothendieck polynomials\nindexed by sequences of negative integers. For quivers of type A3 , we prove the\nfull statement of Conjecture 1.1, and we provide positive combinatorial formulas\nfor the quiver coefficients in terms of counting set-valued tableaux.\nWe remark that the positivity properties of quiver cycles suggested by Conjecture 1.1 are analogous to positivity properties satisfied by a closed and irreducible\nsubvariety Y of a homogeneous space G/P . In fact, the cohomology class of Y\ncan be uniquely written as a positive linear combination of Schubert classes, where\nthe coefficients count the intersection points of Y with the dual Schubert varieties\nplaced in general position. Furthermore, Brion has proved that if Y has rational\n\n\fQUIVER COEFFICIENTS OF DYNKIN TYPE\n\n3\n\nsingularities, then the Grothendieck class of Y is an alternating linear combination of K-theoretic Schubert classes [5]. Aside from this analogy, our conjecture is\nsupported by computer experiments.\nSome other formulas for quiver cycles of Dynkin type have been given, which do\nnot involve quiver coefficients. First of all, Feh\u00e9r and Rim\u00e1nyi have proved that the\ncohomology class of an orbit closure of Dynkin type is uniquely determined, up to\na constant, by the property that its restriction to any disjoint orbit vanishes [18].\nRim\u00e1nyi and the author have used this result to prove a positive combinatorial formula for the cohomology class of any orbit closure for a (non-equioriented) quiver of\ntype A, which expresses this class as a sum of products of Schubert polynomials [15].\nA conjectured K-theory version furthermore expresses the Grothendieck classes of\nsuch orbit closures as alternating sums of products of Grothendieck polynomials.\nThese formulas generalize the (non-stable) component formulas for equioriented\nquivers proved by Knutson, Miller, and Shimozono in cohomology [25] and by the\nauthor in K-theory [10]. Despite the positivity displayed by the generalized component formulas, we have not been able to relate them to positivity properties of\nquiver coefficients in the non-equioriented cases. Finally, a recent preprint of Knutson and Shimozono [26] contains a formula for the Grothendieck class of any orbit\nclosure of Dynkin type which has rational singularities. This formula is stated in\nterms of Demazure operators, but does not to our knowledge suggest any positivity\nproperties of quiver cycles.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we recall the definition and\nrequired properties of stable Grothendieck polynomials. Section 3 describes the\nequivariant Grothendieck class of a quiver cycle, defines the corresponding quiver\ncoefficients, and discusses the available evidence for Conjecture 1.1. We also give\nan example of an orbit closure for which the associated quiver coefficients do not\nhave alternating signs. This orbit closure was earlier studied by Zwara [35], who\nproved that it does not have rational singularities. In section 4 we interpret quiver\ncoefficients in terms of formulas for degeneracy loci defined by a quiver of vector\nbundles over a base variety. In section 5 we describe Reineke's desingularization of\norbit closures of Dynkin type. This desingularization is used in section 6 to prove\na combinatorial formula for quiver coefficients of Dynkin type. The last section\ncontains the proof of Conjecture 1.1 for quivers of type A3 .\nOur formula for orbit closures of Dynkin type was proved at the time the preprint\n[26] became available. We do, however, thank Allen Knutson for earlier suggesting\nthat resolutions that we used to compute quiver coefficients of types A and D might\nbe special cases of Reineke's general construction. We have benefited from many\ndiscussions with Rich\u00e1rd Rim\u00e1nyi on this general subject, and from answers to\nquestions and useful references provided by Wilbert van der Kallen and Michel\nBrion regarding group actions and equivariant K-theory. We also thank Johan de\nJong, Friedrich Knop, Chris Woodward, and Bobi\u0144ski Zwara for helpful comments\nand answers to questions.\n2. Grothendieck polynomials\nIn this section we fix notation for stable Grothendieck polynomials and state the\nrequired properties. We refer to [9, 8] for more details.\nA partition is a weakly decreasing sequence of non-negative\nintegers \u03bb = (\u03bb1 \u2265\nP\n\u03bb2 \u2265 * * * \u2265 \u03bbl \u2265 0). The weight of \u03bb is the sum |\u03bb| =\n\u03bbi of its parts and the\n\n\f4\n\nANDERS SKOVSTED BUCH\n\nlength l(\u03bb) is the number of non-zero parts. We will identify the partition \u03bb with its\nYoung diagram, which has \u03bb1 boxes in the top row, \u03bb2 boxes in the next row, etc.\nA set-valued tableau of shape \u03bb is a filling T of the boxes of \u03bb with finite non-empty\nsets of positive integers, such that the largest integer in any box is smaller than\nor equal to the smallest integer in the box to the right of it, and strictly smaller\nthan the smallest integer in the box below it. Given an infinite set of commuting\nvariables x = (x1 , x2 , . . . ), we let xT denote the monomial in which the exponent\nof xi is the number of boxes of T containing i, and we let |T | be the (total) degree\nof xT . For example, the set-valued tableau\nT =\n\n1,2 2 2,5,8\n4 7,8\n\nhas shape \u03bb = (3, 2) and gives xT = x1 x23 x4 x5 x7 x82 and |T | = 9.\nThe single stable Grothendieck polynomial for the partition \u03bb is defined as the\nformal power series\nX\nG\u03bb = G\u03bb (x) =\n(\u22121)|T |\u2212|\u03bb| xT ,\nT\n\nwhere the sum is over all set-valued tableaux T of shape \u03bb. This power series is\nsymmetric, and its term of lowest degree is the Schur function s\u03bb . It was proved\nin [9] to be a special case of the stable Grothendieck polynomials indexed by permutations of Fomin and Kirillov [19], which in turn were constructed as limits of\nLascoux and Sch\u00fctzenberger's ordinary Grothendieck polynomials. By convention,\na stable Grothendieck polynomial applied to a finite set of variables is defined by\nG\u03bb (x1 , . . . , xp ) = G\u03bb (x1 , . . . , xp , 0, 0, . . . ).\nGiven a set-valued tableau T , define its word w(T ) to be the sequence of integers\nin its boxes when read one row at the time from left to right, with the rows ordered\nfrom bottom to top. Integers in the same box are arranged in increasing order. For\nexample, the tableau displayed above gives w(T ) = (4, 7, 8, 1, 2, 2, 2, 5, 8). A word\nof positive integers is called a reverse lattice word if every occurrence of an integer\ni \u2265 2 is followed by more occurrences of i \u2212 1 than of i. The content of a word\nis the sequence \u03bd = (\u03bd1 , \u03bd2 , . . . ) where \u03bdi is the number of occurrences of i in the\nword. For any partition \u03bc = (\u03bc1 , . . . , \u03bcl ), let u(\u03bc) = (l\u03bcl , . . . , 2\u03bc2 , 1\u03bc1 ) be the word\nof the tableau of shape \u03bc in which all boxes in row i contains the single integer\ni. We need the following generalization of the classical Littlewood-Richardson rule\nfrom [9, Thm. 5.4] (an alternative proof can be found in [12, \u00a73.5]).\nTheorem 2.1. The product of two stable Grothendieck polynomials is given by\nX\nG\u03bb * G\u03bc =\nc\u03bd\u03bb\u03bc G\u03bd\n\u03bd\n\nwhere the sum is over all partitions \u03bd, and c\u03bd\u03bb\u03bc is equal to (\u22121)|\u03bd|\u2212|\u03bb|\u2212|\u03bc| times the\nnumber of set-valued tableaux T of shape \u03bb for which the composition w(T )u(\u03bc) is\na reverse lattice word with content \u03bd.\nFor example, the set-valued tableaux 1 , 2 , and 1,2 correspond to the terms\n+ G \u2212 G . If a coefficient c\u03bd\u03bb\u03bc is non-zero, then\nof the product G * G = G\n|\u03bb| + |\u03bc| \u2264 |\u03bd| and (the Young diagrams of) \u03bb and \u03bc can be contained in \u03bd.\n\n\fQUIVER COEFFICIENTS OF DYNKIN TYPE\n\n5\n\nL\nTheorem 2.1 implies that the linear span \u0393 =\nZG\u03bb of all stable Grothendieck\npolynomials is a commutative ring. The stable Grothendieck polynomials are linearly independent since the term of lowest degree in G\u03bb is the Schur function s\u03bb .\nIf \u03bb, \u03bc, and \u03bd are partitions such that \u03bb and \u03bc fit inside a rectangular partition\nR, we define\nd\u03bd\u03bb\u03bc\n\n=\n\nc\u03c1R \u03bd\n\nR\n, where \u03c1 = (R + \u03bc, \u03bb) =\n\n\u03bc\n\n\u03bb\n\nis the partition obtained by attaching \u03bb and \u03bc to the bottom and right sides of R.\nThis constant d\u03bd\u03bb\u03bc is independent of the choice of rectangle R, and it is non-zero\nonly if |\u03bd| \u2264 |\u03bb|+|\u03bc| and \u03bb, \u03bc \u2282 \u03bd [9,PThm. 6.6]. These constants define a coproduct\n\u2206 : \u0393 \u2192 \u0393 \u2297 \u0393 given by \u2206(G\u03bd ) = \u03bb,\u03bc d\u03bd\u03bb\u03bc G\u03bb \u2297 G\u03bc , which gives \u0393 a structure of\ncommutative and cocommutative bialgebra with unit and counit [9, Cor. 6.7].\nGiven an additional set of commuting variables y = (y1 , y2 , . . . ), define the double\nstable Grothendieck polynomial for the partition \u03bd by\nX\nG\u03bd (x; y) =\nd\u03bd\u03bb\u03bc G\u03bb (x) * G\u03bc\u2032 (y) ,\n\u03bb,\u03bc\n\n\u2032\n\nwhere \u03bc is the conjugate partition of \u03bc, obtained by interchanging the rows and\ncolumns of \u03bc.

Another useful identity is\nthe factorization formula [9, Cor. 6.3], which states that\n(4) GR+\u03bc,\u03bb (x1 , . . . , xp ; y1 , . . . , yq ) =\nG\u03bb (0; y1 , . . . , yq ) * GR (x1 , . . . , xp ; y1 , . . . , yq ) * G\u03bc (x1 , . . . , xp )\nwhenever \u03bb and \u03bc are partitions with \u03bb1 \u2264 q and l(\u03bc) \u2264 p, and R = (q p ) is the\nrectangular partition with p rows and q columns.\nLemma 2.2.

Thus any\nfinite integer sequence I gives a well defined element GI \u2208 \u0393. This notation is\nrequired in our formula for quiver coefficients of Dynkin type given in section 6.\n3. Quiver coefficients\nIn this section we define quiver coefficients and discuss their conjectured positivity properties. We start by giving an elementary construction of the Grothendieck\nclass of an invariant closed subvariety in a representation.\n3.1. Grothendieck classes. Let G be a linear algebraic group over the field K\nand let V be a rational representation of G, i.e. V is a K-vector space of finite\ndimension and the G-action is given by a map of varieties G \u2192 GL(V ). Then the\ncoordinate ring K[V ] = Sym\u2022 (V \u2228 ) of polynomial functions on V has a locally finite\nlinear G-action, which in set-theoretic notation is given by (g.f )(v) = f (g \u22121 .v) for\ng \u2208 G, f \u2208 K[V ], and v \u2208 V . Locally finite means that K[V ] is a union of rational\nrepresentations of G. Define a (K[V ], G)-module to be a module M over K[V ]\ntogether with a locally finite linear G-action on M which satisfies that g.(f m) =\n(g.f ) (g.m) for m \u2208 M . We will say that M is finitely generated (resp. free) if\nthis is true as a K[V ]-module. If M is finitely generated, then there exists a finite\ndimensional G-stable vector subspace U \u2282 M which contains a set of generators.\nNotice that K[V ] \u2297K U has a natural structure of (K[V ], G)-module, where K[V ]\nacts on the first factor and G acts on both factors. The map K[V ] \u2297 U \u2192 M given\nby f \u2297 u 7\u2192 f u is a surjective G-equivariant map. Since M has finite projective\n\n\fQUIVER COEFFICIENTS OF DYNKIN TYPE\n\n7\n\ndimension as a module over the polynomial ring K[V ], and all projective K[V ]modules are free, it follows that M has a finite equivariant resolution by finitely\ngenerated free (K[V ], G)-modules.\nLet \u03a9 \u2282 V be a G-stable closed subvariety. Then the coordinate ring O\u03a9 =\nK[V ]/I(\u03a9) is a finitely generated (K[V ], G)-module, so it has an equivariant resolution\n(8)\n\n0 \u2192 Fp \u2192 Fp\u22121 \u2192 * * * \u2192 F0 \u2192 O\u03a9 \u2192 0\n\nwhere Fi is a finitely generated free (K[V ], G)-module. Notice that Fi /mFi is a\nrational representation of G for each i, where m = I(0) \u2282 K[V ] is the maximal\nideal of functions vanishing at the origin of V .\nLet R(G) be the ring of virtual representations of G, i.e. formal linear combinations of irreducible rational representations. Multiplication in this ring is defined\nby tensor products. We define the G-equivariant Grothendieck class of \u03a9 to be the\nvirtual representation\nX\n[O\u03a9 ] =\n(\u22121)i [Fi /mFi ] \u2208 R(G) .\ni\u22650\n\nIt follows from results of Thomason [33] that this class can be identified with the\nclass of the structure sheaf of \u03a9 in the equivariant K-theory of V , see section 4.\nL\n3.2. Classes of quiver cycles. Let V = a\u2208Q1 Hom(Et(a) , Eh(a) ) be the vector\nspace of representations\nof the quiver Q. Then V is a rational representation of\nQn\nthe group G = i=1 GL(Ei ). It follows that any quiver cycle \u03a9 \u2282 V defines a\nGrothendieck class [O\u03a9 ] \u2208 R(G).\nChoose a decomposition of each vertex vector space as a sum of one dimensional\nvector spaces, Ei = Li1 \u2295 * * * \u2295 Liei , and let T \u2282 G be the maximal torus that\npreserves these decompositions. Then the virtual representations of T form the\nLaurent polynomial ring R(T) = Z[ [Lij ]\u00b11 ]. It follows from [24, Cor. II.2.7] that\nthe restriction map R(G) \u2192 R(T) is injective, and the image must consist of\nLaurent polynomials that are simultaneously symmetric in each group of variables\n{[Li1 ], . . . , [Liei ]}. Since all such polynomials can be generated by the exterior powers\nVj\n[ Ei ] \u2208 R(G), it follows that R(G) \u2282 R(T) is the subring of simultaneously\nsymmetric Laurent polynomials.\nSet xij = 1 \u2212 [Lij ]\u22121 for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n and 1 \u2264 j \u2264 ei , and let ZJxij K be the ring\nof formal power series\nP in these variables. We will consider R(T) as a subring of\nZJxij K, with [Lij ] = p\u22650 (xij )p . In particular, the Grothendieck class [O\u03a9 ] can be\nregarded as a power series in ZJxij K. The T-equivariant cohomology of V can be\nidentified with the polynomial ring HT\u2217 (V ) = Z[xij ], and HG\u2217 (V ) \u2282 HT\u2217 (V ) is the\nsubring of simultaneously symmetric polynomials. The power series [O\u03a9 ] \u2208 ZJxij K\nhas no non-zero terms of total degree smaller than d = codim(\u03a9; V ), and the term\nof degree d is the cohomology class [\u03a9] \u2208 HGd (V ), see section 4.2.\nIf U is any rational representation of G, we can write it as a direct sum of one\ndimensional T-representations, U = L1 \u2295 * * * \u2295 Lu . Given a partition \u03bd we then\ndefine G\u03bd (U ) = G\u03bd (1 \u2212 [L1 ]\u22121 , . . . , 1 \u2212 [Lu ]\u22121 ) \u2208 R(G) \u2282 R(T). For example,\nG\u03bd (Ei ) = G\u03bd (xi1 , . . . , xiei ). More generally, given two rational G-representations U1\n\n\f8\n\nANDERS SKOVSTED BUCH\n\nand U2 we define\nG\u03bd (U1 \u2212 U2 ) =\n\n(9)\n\nX\n\nd\u03bd\u03bb\u03bc G\u03bb (U1 ) G\u03bc\u2032 (U2\u2228 ) \u2208 R(G)\n\n\u03bb,\u03bc\n\nU2\u2228\n\nwhere\nis the dual representation of U2 . The Schur function s\u03bd (U1 \u2212 U2 ) is\ndefined as the term of total (and lowest) degree |\u03bd| in G\u03bd (U1 \u2212 U2 ) when considered\nas a power series in ZJxij K.\nFrom now on we assume that Q is a quiver without oriented loops. Our definition\nof quiver\nL coefficients is based on the following proposition. Recall that we set\nMi = a:h(a)=i Et(a) for i \u2208 Q0 .\nProposition 3.1. Let Q be a quiver without oriented loops. Every element of R(G)\ncan be expressed uniquely as a (possibly infinite) Z-linear combination of products\nG\u03bc1 (E1 \u2212 M1 ) G\u03bc2 (E2 \u2212 M2 ) * * * G\u03bcn (En \u2212 Mn )\ngiven by partitions \u03bc1 , . . . , \u03bcn such that l(\u03bci ) \u2264 ei for each i.\nProof. Let l \u2208 Q0 be a vertex which is not the tail of any arrow in Q. Since every\nelement of R(G) \u2282 ZJxij K is symmetric in the variables xl1 , . . . , xlel , we can use\nLemma 2.2 to write it as an (infinite) linear combination of the elements G\u03bcl (El \u2212\nMl ) given by partitions \u03bcl with at most el rows, and with coefficients in the subring\nR = ZJxij : i 6= lK. By induction on n, applied to the quiver obtained from Q by\nremoving the vertex l and all arrows to it, it follows\nQ that each of the coefficients\n\u0003\nare unique Z-linear combinations of the products i6=l G\u03bci (Ei \u2212 Mi ).\nDefinition 3.2. Let \u03a9 \u2282 V be a quiver cycle for a quiver Q without oriented\nloops. The quiver coefficients of \u03a9 are the unique integers c\u03bc (\u03a9) \u2208 Z, indexed by\nsequences \u03bc = (\u03bc1 , . . . , \u03bcn ) of partitions \u03bci with l(\u03bci ) \u2264 ei , such that\nX\n[O\u03a9 ] =\nc\u03bc (\u03a9) G\u03bc1 (E1 \u2212 M1 ) G\u03bc2 (E2 \u2212 M2 ) * * * G\u03bcn (En \u2212 Mn ) \u2208 R(G) .\n\u03bc\n\nThe cohomological quiver coefficients of \u03a9 are the coefficients c\u03bc (\u03a9) for which\nP\n|\u03bci | = codim(\u03a9).\n\nIt follows from Corollary 4.3 below that these coefficients generalize the equioriented quiver coefficients from [11, 8]. The cohomological quiver coefficients determine the cohomology class of \u03a9 as\nX\nc\u03bc (\u03a9) s\u03bc1 (E1 \u2212 M1 ) s\u03bc2 (E2 \u2212 M2 ) * * * s\u03bcn (En \u2212 Mn ) \u2208 HG\u2217 (V ) .\n[\u03a9] =\nP\n\n|\u03bci |=codim(\u03a9)\n\nExample 3.3. Let Q = {1 \u2192 2} be a quiver of type A2 . Then any quiver cycle\nin V = Hom(E1 , E2 ) has the form \u03a9r = {\u03c6 \u2208 V | rank(\u03c6) \u2264 r}. It follows\nfrom the Thom-Porteous formula of [8, Thm. 2.3] and Corollary 4.3 that [O\u03a9r ] =\nGR (E2 \u2212 E1 ), where R = (e1 \u2212 r)e2 \u2212r is the rectangular partition with e2 \u2212 r rows\nand e1 \u2212 r columns. We have c(R) (\u03a9r ) = 1, and all other quiver coefficients of \u03a9r\nare zero.\n3.3. Properties of quiver coefficients. We do not know a good reason why the\nquiver coefficients should satisfy the finiteness and positivity properties stated in\nConjecture 1.1. In the case of equioriented quivers where this conjecture is known,\nthese properties are consequences of explicit formulas for quiver coefficients that are\nproved with a combination of geometric and combinatorial methods. This is also\n\n\fQUIVER COEFFICIENTS OF DYNKIN TYPE\n\n9\n\ntrue for our proof of the finiteness part (a) for quivers of Dynkin type in section 6,\nand our proof of the full conjecture for quivers of type A3 in section 7. However,\nif the full conjecture is true, then it is natural to expect that some underlying\ngeometric principle is in play.\nOne might try to express the classes of quiver cycles as linear combinations of\nother products of Grothendieck polynomials than those used in Definition 3.2, but\nmost choices do not lead to finiteness or positivity properties of the coefficients (or\nthey lead to such properties that follow from Conjecture 1.1). The one interesting\nalternative choice that we know about is to define dual quiver coefficients e\nc\u03bc (\u03a9) of\na quiver cycle \u03a9 by the identity\nX\n[O\u03a9 ] =\ne\nc\u03bc (\u03a9) G\u03bc1 (N1 \u2212 E1 ) G\u03bc2 (N2 \u2212 E2 ) * * * G\u03bcn (Nn \u2212 En ) ,\n\u03bc\n\nwhere the sum is over sequences \u03bc = (\u03bc1 ,L\n. . . , \u03bcn ) of partitions such that \u03bci has\nat most ei columns for each i, and Ni = a:t(a)=i Eh(a) . These dual coefficients\nare nothing but the ordinary quiver coefficients for \u03a9 when considered as a cycle\nof quiver representations on the dual vector spaces Ei\u2228 , for the quiver obtained\nfrom Q by reversing all arrows. This follows from the identity G\u03bb (U1 \u2212 U2 ) =\nG\u03bb\u2032 (U2\u2228 \u2212 U1\u2228 ) which holds for arbitrary rational representations U1 and U2 of G\n[9, Lemma 3.4]. We note that for an equioriented quiver Q = {1 \u2192 2 \u2192 * * * \u2192 n},\nthe two notions of quiver coefficients also coincide without modifying the quiver.\nIn fact, an equioriented coefficient c(\u03bc1 ,...,\u03bcn ) (\u03a9) is non-zero only if \u03bc1 is the empty\npartition, in which case we have c(\u2205,\u03bc2 ,...,\u03bcn ) (\u03a9) = e\nc(\u03bc2 ,...,\u03bcn ,\u2205) (\u03a9). On the other\nhand, for quivers that are not equioriented, it appears to be difficult to relate the\nproperties of quiver coefficients and dual quiver coefficients of the same quiver cycle.\nFor the simplest example, the reader is invited to compare the formulas for inbound\nand outbound A3 -quivers proved in section 7.\nIt is convenient to encode the quiver coefficients for \u03a9 as a linear combination of\ntensors,\nX\n(10)\nP\u03a9 =\nc\u03bc (\u03a9) G\u03bc1 \u2297 G\u03bc2 \u2297 * * * \u2297 G\u03bcn .\n\u03bc\n\nIf Conjecture 1.1 (a) is true, then this is an element of the tensor power \u0393\u2297n\nof the ring of stable Grothendieck polynomials \u0393; otherwise P\u03a9 lives in a completion\nP of this ring. We will use the notation that for any linear combination\nP = \u03bc c\u03bc G\u03bc1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 G\u03bcn and classes \u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1n \u2208 R(G), we set P (\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1n ) =\nP\n\u03bc c\u03bc G\u03bc1 (\u03b11 ) * * * G\u03bcn (\u03b1n ). The definition of quiver coefficients then states that\n[O\u03a9 ] = P\u03a9 (E1 \u2212 M1 , . . . , En \u2212 Mn ) \u2208 R(G).\nIn addition to the evidence for Conjecture 1.1 mentioned above, we have used\nMacaulay 2 [23] and other software to compute the quiver coefficients of many\nquiver cycles, including some that are not orbit closures (and not of Dynkin type).\nIn almost all cases where Macaulay 2 was able to produce a free resolution of the\ncoordinate ring of a quiver cycle, we could convert the corresponding expression for\nits Grothendieck class into a finite linear combination of products of Grothendieck\npolynomials as in Definition 3.2. In a few cases we did not succeed in this, but expect\nthat this was caused by lack of computing power. We have never encountered any\nnegative cohomological quiver coefficients; and when the general quiver coefficients\nfailed to have alternating signs, we could often show that the corresponding quiver\n\n\f10\n\nANDERS SKOVSTED BUCH\n\ncycle did not have rational singularities, for example by using Brion's theorem\ndescribed in the introduction [5].\nExample 3.4. Let Q = {1 \u2192\n\u2192 2} be the Kronecker quiver and fix the dimension\nvector e = (3, 3).

In fact, the terms G\u03bb \u2297 G\u03bd of P\u03a9 displayed\nabove are sorted according to the lexicographic order on the partitions, with \u03bd\ntaking precedence over \u03bb, which makes the periodicity readily visible. Furthermore,\nstarting from the degree 8 term, the signs of the quiver coefficients are the opposite\nof the expected. We have also observed this phenomenon for other quiver cycles\nwithout rational singularities, but have no explanation for it.\nOur calculation also shows that \u03a9 is the cone over a subvariety of P17 with\nGrothendieck class equal to\n51 h4 \u2212 132 h5 + 70 h6 + 144 h7 \u2212 261 h8 + 184 h9 \u2212 66 h10 + 12 h11 \u2212 h12\nwhere h is the class of a hyperplane. Using Brion's result [5], this gives an alternative\nproof that \u03a9 lacks rational singularities.\n\n\fQUIVER COEFFICIENTS OF DYNKIN TYPE\n\n11\n\nFinally, if the cohomology class of \u03a9 is expressed in the basis of products\ns\u03bc1 (E1 ) s\u03bc2 (E2 \u2212 E1 ), then we obtain\n[\u03a9] = 3s3,1 (E2 \u2212E1 ) + s1 (E1 )s3 (E2 \u2212E1 ) + s2,2 (E2 \u2212E1 ) \u2212 2s1 (E1 )s2,1 (E2 \u2212E1 )\n\u2212 2s1,1 (E1 )s2 (E2 \u2212E1 ) + s1,1 (E1 )s1,1 (E2 \u2212E1 ) + 3s1,1,1 (E1 )s1 (E2 \u2212E1 ) .\nThis illustrates that our choice of basis is essential to the positivity conjecture. It is\nalso essential to the finiteness conjecture, since in general it requires an infinite linear\ncombination of products G\u03bc1 (E1 )G\u03bc2 (E2 \u2212 E1 ) to express a class G\u03bb (E2 \u2212 E1 \u2295 E1 ).\n4. Degeneracy loci\nThis section interprets quiver coefficients as formulas for degeneracy loci defined\nby quivers of vector bundles over a base variety. We start by summarizing some\nfacts about equivariant K-theory of schemes based on Thomason's paper [33].\n4.1. K-theory. Let G be an algebraic group over the field K and let X be an\nalgebraic G-scheme over K. A G-equivariant sheaf on X is a coherent OX -module\nF together with a given isomorphism I : a\u2217 F \u223c\n= p\u22172 F , where a : G \u00d7 X \u2192 X is the\naction and p2 : G \u00d7 X \u2192 X is the projection. This isomorphism must satisfy that\n(m \u00d7 idX )\u2217 I = p\u221723 I \u25e6 (idG \u00d7a)\u2217 I as morphisms of sheaves on G \u00d7 G \u00d7 X, where\nm is the group operation on G and p23 is the projection to the last two factors of\nG \u00d7 G \u00d7 X. A G-equivariant vector bundle on X is a locally free G-equivariant\nsheaf of constant rank.\nThe G-equivariant K-homology of X is the Grothendieck group KG (X) generated by isomorphism classes of G-equivariant sheaves, modulo relations saying\nthat [F ] = [F \u2032 ] + [F \u2032\u2032 ] if there exists a G-equivariant short exact sequence 0 \u2192\nF \u2032 \u2192 F \u2192 F \u2032\u2032 \u2192 0. The G-equivariant K-cohomology of X is the Grothendieck\nring K G (X) of G-equivariant vector bundles. The group KG (X) is a module over\nthe ring K G (X); both the ring structure of K G (X) and its action on KG (X)\nare defined by tensor products. If X is a non-singular variety and G is a linear\nalgebraic group, then the implicit map K G (X) \u2192 KG (X) that sends an equivariant vector bundle to its sheaf of sections is an isomorphism [33, Thm. 1.8]. The\nequivariant K-theory of a point is the ring K G (point) = R(G) of virtual representations of G. Any G-equivariant map f : X \u2192 Y defines a ring homomorphism\nf \u2217 : K G (Y ) \u2192 K G (X) given by pullback of vector bundles. If f is flat then it\nalso defines a pullback map f \u2217 : KG (Y ) \u2192 KG (X) on Grothendieck groups. The\nsame is true\nP if f is a regular embedding, in which case the pullback is given by\nf \u2217 [F ] = i\u22650 (\u22121)i [TorYi (OX , F )]. A proper equivariant map f : X \u2192 Y defines\nP\na pushforward map f\u2217 : KG (X) \u2192 KG (Y ) given by f\u2217 [F ] = i\u22650 (\u22121)i [Ri f\u2217 F ].\nThis pushforward map is a homomorphism of K G (Y )-modules by the projection\nformula. If \u03c0 : E \u2192 X is (the total space of) a G-equivariant vector bundle, then\n\u03c0 \u2217 : KG (X) \u2192 KG (E) is an isomorphism [33, Thm. 1.7], and we will identify\nKG (E) with KG (X) using this map. The inverse map is pullback along any equivariant section X \u2192 E. When G = {e} is the trivial group, we will use the notation\nK \u25e6 (X) = K {e} (X) and K\u25e6 (X) = K{e} (X) for the ordinary K-theory groups of X.\nStable Grothendieck polynomials can be used to define K-theory classes as follows. Given a vector bundle over X which can be written as a direct sum of line\nbundles E = L1 \u2295 * * * \u2295 Lr , and a partition \u03bd, we define\n(11)\n\n\u22121\n\u25e6\nG\u03bd (E) = G\u03bd (1 \u2212 L\u22121\n1 , . . . , 1 \u2212 Lr ) \u2208 K (X) .\n\n\f12\n\nANDERS SKOVSTED BUCH\n\nThe symmetry of G\u03bd implies that this class is a polynomial in the exterior powers\nof the dual bundle E \u2228 , so it is well defined even when E is not a direct sum of line\nbundles. Furthermore, if X is a G-scheme and E is a G-equivariant vector bundle,\nthen (11) defines a class G\u03bd (E) \u2208 K G (X). Given two G-vector bundles E1 and E2\nwe define\nX\n(12)\nG\u03bd (E1 \u2212 E2 ) =\nd\u03bd\u03bb\u03bc G\u03bb (E1 ) G\u03bc\u2032 (E2\u2228 ) \u2208 K G (X) .\n\u03bb,\u03bc\n\nThis extends (9). The linear map \u0393 \u2192 K G (X) given by G\u03bd 7\u2192 G\u03bd (E1 \u2212 E2 ) is a ring\nhomomorphism. The identity (2) implies that G\u03bd (E1 \u2295 E3 \u2212 E2 \u2295 E3 ) = G\u03bd (E1 \u2212 E2 )\nfor any third G-vector bundle E3 . Equivalently, the stable Grothendieck polynomial\nfor \u03bd defines P\na linear operator G\u03bd : K G (X) \u2192 K G (X). Equation (3) implies that\nG\u03bd (\u03b1 + \u03b2) = \u03bb,\u03bc d\u03bd\u03bb\u03bc G\u03bb (\u03b1)G\u03bc (\u03b2) for all classes \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 K G (X).\n\n4.2. Interpretations of Grothendieck classes. Assume that G is a connected\nreductive linear algebraic group containing a K-split maximal torus T \u2282 G, i.e.\nT \u223c\n= (Gm )r is defined over K. Let V be a rational representation of G and let\n\u03a9 \u2282 V be a G-stable closed subvariety. Then the structure sheaf O\u03a9 is a Gequivariant sheaf on V , so it defines a class [O\u03a9 ] \u2208 KG (V ). If we use the fact that\nV is an equivariant vector bundle over a point to identify KG (V ) with R(G), then\nthis class agrees with the Grothendieck class of \u03a9 defined in Section 3.1.\nLet X be an algebraic scheme equipped with a principal G-bundle P \u2192 X, i.e.\nG acts freely on P and X equals P/G as a geometric quotient [30]. For a G-variety\nY we write YG = P \u00d7G Y = (P \u00d7 Y )/G. We will use this notation only when Y is\nequivariantly embedded as a closed subvariety of a non-singular variety, in which\ncase it follows from [17, Prop. 23] that YG is defined as a scheme. Using that the\ncategory of G-equivariant sheaves on P is equivalent to the category of coherent\nOX -modules [4, Thm. 6.1.4], it follows that VG is a vector bundle over X with\nfibers isomorphic to V [17, Lemma 1], and the closed subscheme \u03a9G \u2282 VG is a\ntranslated degeneracy locus, consisting of one copy of \u03a9 in each fiber. It's structure\nsheaf defines a Grothendieck class [O\u03a9G ] \u2208 K\u25e6 (VG ) = K\u25e6 (X).\nMore generally, let H be a second algebraic group over K, and assume that P\nand X are H-schemes so that the map P \u2192 X is equivariant and the H-action\non P commutes with the G-action. In this case VG is an H-vector bundle over\nX, and \u03a9G defines an equivariant class [O\u03a9G ] \u2208 KH (VG ) = KH (X). Let \u03c6G :\nR(G) \u2192 K H (X) be the ring homomorphism defined by \u03c6G (U ) = [UG ] for any\nrational G-representation U . The following lemma interprets the Grothendieck\nclass [O\u03a9 ] \u2208 R(G) as a formula for degeneracy loci.\nProposition 4.1. The H-equivariant Grothendieck class of \u03a9G \u2282 VG is given by\n[O\u03a9G ] = \u03c6G ([O\u03a9 ]) \u2208 KH (X).\nProof. A finitely generated free (K[V ], G)-module F corresponds to a G-equivariant\nvector bundle Fe = Spec(Sym\u2022 F \u2228 ) over V , which in turn defines the H-equivariant\nvector bundle FeG = P \u00d7G Fe on VG [17, Lemma 1]. This construction applied to\n(8) produces an exact sequence\n0 \u2192 (Fer )G \u2192 (Fer\u22121 )G \u2192 * * * \u2192 (Fe0 )G \u2192 O\u03a9G \u2192 0\n\nof H-equivariant coherent sheaves on VG . Let s : X \u2192 VG be the zero section.\nSince the fiber of Fei over the origin of V equals Fi /mFi , it follows that s\u2217 (Fei )G =\n\n\fQUIVER COEFFICIENTS OF DYNKIN TYPE\n\n(Fi /mFi )G . We conclude that\nX\nX\n[O\u03a9G ] =\n(\u22121)i s\u2217 [(Fei )G ] =\n(\u22121)i [(Fi /mFi )G ] = \u03c6G ([O\u03a9 ])\ni\u22650\n\n13\n\ni\u22650\n\nin KH (X), as required.\n\n\u0003\n\nWrite T = (Gm )r as a product of multiplicative groups, and define one-dimensional T -representations L1 , . . . , Lr by Li = K and (t1 , . . . , tr ).v = ti v for v \u2208 Li .\n\u22121\n\u00b11\nThen we have R(T ) = Z[L\u00b11\n1 , . . . , Lr ] \u2282 ZJx1 , . . . , xr K where xi = 1 \u2212 Li . Since\nR(G) \u2282 R(T ) by [24, Cor. II.2.7], we may regard the class [O\u03a9 ] as a power series.\nThe variety \u03a9 \u2282 V also defines a class [\u03a9] in the equivariant Chow cohomology ring HT\u2217 (V ). If we abuse notation and write xi also for the Chern root\nc1 (Li ) \u2208 HT\u2217 (point) = HT\u2217 (V ), then this ring is the polynomial ring HT\u2217 (V ) =\nZ[x1 , . . . , xr ] by [34, \u00a715], and the class [\u03a9] coincides with the term of total degree\nd = codim(\u03a9; V ) in the power series [O\u03a9 ]. To see this, we need Totaro's algebraic\u0001\nQr\napproximation of the classifying space for T [34]. Set P = i=1 L\u2295d+1\nr {0}\ni\nQr\nand X = P/T = i=1 Pd . Then HTi (V ) = H i (VT ) = H i (X) for i \u2264 d by [34,\nThm. 1.1] or [17, Prop. 4], where VT = P \u00d7T V and xi \u2208 HTi (V ) corresponds to a\nhyperplane class in the i-th factor of X. The cohomology class of \u03a9 is defined by\n[\u03a9] := [\u03a9T ] \u2208 H d (VT ). Let ch : K \u25e6 (VT ) \u2192 H \u2217 (VT ) \u2297 Q be the Chern character, i.e.\nthe ring homomorphism defined formally by ch(L) = exp(c1 (L)) for any line bundle\nL on VT [20, Ex. 3.2.3]. Then we have ch(\u03c6T (xi )) = 1 \u2212 exp(\u2212xi ), so the lowest\nterm of [O\u03a9 ] agrees with the lowest term of ch(\u03c6T ([O\u03a9 ])). Now Proposition 4.1\nand [20, Ex. 15.2.16] imply that ch(\u03c6T ([O\u03a9 ])) = ch([O\u03a9T ]) = [\u03a9T ] + higher terms.\nThis shows that [\u03a9] is the lowest term in [O\u03a9 ], and also that [O\u03a9 ] has no non-zero\nterms of degree smaller than codim(\u03a9; V ).\nWe finally prove that the Grothendieck class of \u03a9 is uniquely determined by the\nformula it provides in ordinary K-theory.\nProposition 4.2. The equivariant Grothendieck class of \u03a9 is the unique virtual\nrepresentation [O\u03a9 ] \u2208 R(G) for which [O\u03a9G ] = \u03c6G ([O\u03a9 ]) \u2208 K\u25e6 (X) for every nonsingular variety X and principal G-bundle P \u2192 X.\nProof. In view of Proposition 4.1, it is enough to show that if \u03b1 6= 0 \u2208 R(G), then\nfor some principal G-bundle P \u2192 X with X non-singular we have \u03c6G (\u03b1) 6= 0 \u2208\nK\u25e6 (X).\nLet d be the degree of the lowest non-zero term of \u03b1 \u2208 ZJx1 , . . . , xr K. As in [17,\nLemma 9] we embed G in GL(m) for some m and let P be the set of all m \u00d7 (m + d)\nmatrices of full rank. Then G acts freely on P , the quotients X = P/G and P/T\nare non-singular varieties, and since P has codimension d + 1 in the vector space\nof all m \u00d7 (m + d) matrices, it follows from [34, Thm. 1.1] or [17, Prop. 4] that\nH i (P/T ) = HTi (V ) for i \u2264 d. Consider the commutative diagram\nR(G)\n\u03c6G\n\n\u000f\u000f\nK \u25e6 (X)\n\n// R(T )\n\u03c6T\n\n\u000f\u000f\n// K \u25e6 (P/T )\n\nch\n\n// H \u2217 (P/T ) \u2297 Q\n\nwhere the bottom-left map is pullback along P/T \u2192 P/G = X. Since the image of\n\u03b1 in H d (P/T ) \u2297 Q = HTd (V ) \u2297 Q is non-zero, we conclude that \u03c6G (\u03b1) \u2208 K \u25e6 (X) =\nK\u25e6 (X) is non-zero as well.\n\u0003\n\n\f14\n\nANDERS SKOVSTED BUCH\n\n4.3. Degeneracy loci defined by quiver cycles. Let V and G be as in section 3.2, and let \u03a9 \u2282 V be a quiver cycle. We will use the constructions given\nabove to interpret the quiver coefficients of \u03a9 in terms of formulas for degeneracy loci. Let X be an algebraic scheme over K equipped with vector bundles\nE1 , . . . , EnLof ranks given by the dimension vector e = (e1 , . . . , en ). Define the bundle V = a\u2208Q1 Hom(Et(a) , Eh(a) ) over X. Since the fibers of V are isomorphic to\nthe representation space V , any quiver cycle \u03a9 \u2282 V defines a translated degeneracy\ne \u2282 V. To be precise, let \u03c0 : P \u2192 X be the principal G-bundle such that\nlocus \u03a9\nEi = (Ei )G = P \u00d7G Ei for each i. This bundle can be constructed as a multi-frame\nbundle P \u2282 E1\u2295e1 \u2295 * * * \u2295 En\u2295en , with fibers \u03c0 \u22121 (x) consisting of lists of bases of the\ne = \u03a9G \u2282 V.\nfibers Ei (x).

Then P has\na commuting H-action as in section 4.2 and V is an H-vector bundle, so it follows\nfrom Proposition 4.1 that the identity of Corollary 4.3 holds in KH (V). It also\nfollows that s : X \u2192 V is an equivariant section.\nWe can define a localized class \u03a9(E\u2022 ) in KH (\u03a9(E\u2022 )) by\nX\n\u03a9(E\u2022 ) = s!

We note that if Q is a Dynkin quiver of type A or D and K is algebraically\nclosed, then any orbit closure \u03a9 \u2282 V is Cohen-Macaulay [27, 1, 2]. The following\ncorollary generalize all the above formulas involving quiver coefficients, including\nDefinition 3.2.\nCorollary 4.4. Let E\u2022 be a representation of Q consisting of H-equivariant vector\nbundles and bundle maps over X. Assume that both X and \u03a9 are Cohen-Macaulay\nand that the codimension of \u03a9(E\u2022 ) in X is equal to the codimension of \u03a9 in V .\nThen we have\nX\n[O\u03a9(E\u2022 ) ] =\nc\u03bc (\u03a9) G\u03bc1 (E1 \u2212 M1 ) * * * G\u03bcn (En \u2212 Mn ) \u2208 KH (X) .\n\u03bc\n\nLet X be a non-singular variety.

The formula with\nrational coefficients follows from Corollary 4.3 by using the Chern character [20,\nEx. 15.2.16]. If H is a linear algebraic group, then a cohomological analogue of\nCorollary 4.4 can be proved from Corollary 4.5 by first replacing X with the Borel\nconstruction P \u00d7H X, where P/H is an algebraic approximation of the classifying\nspace of H [34, 17], and then applying [20, Prop. 7.1]. We leave the details to the\nreader. We expect that Corollary 4.5 is true without the assumptions, but have not\nfound a proof.\n5. Resolution of singularities\nOur formula for quiver coefficients of Dynkin type is based on Reineke's resolution of the singularities of orbit closures for Dynkin quivers [31]. It will be\nconvenient to formulate Reineke's construction for an arbitrary quiver Q, together\nwith a representation of Q on vector bundles over a base scheme X.\nLet X be an algebraic scheme over K equipped with a representation E\u2022 of Q on\nvector bundles over X, with rank(Ei ) = ei . Let i \u2208 Q0 be a quiver vertex and let r\nbe an integer with 1 \u2264 r \u2264 ei . Let \u03c1 : Y = Gr(ei \u2212 r, Ei ) \u2192 X be the Grassmann\nbundle of rank r quotients of Ei , with universal exact sequence 0 \u2192 S \u2192 Ei \u2192\nQ \u2192 0. (We will avoid explicit notation for pullback of vector bundles.) We define\nthe scheme XL\ni,r = Xi,r (E\u2022 ) to be the zero scheme Xi,r = Z(Mi \u2192 Q) \u2282 Y ,\nwhere Mi = a:h(a)=i Et(a) and the map Mi \u2192 Q is obtained by composing the\n\n\f16\n\nANDERS SKOVSTED BUCH\n\nprojection Ei \u2192 Q with the sum of the bundle maps Ej \u2192 Ei of the representation\nE\u2022 . This scheme has a natural projection \u03c1 : Xi,r \u2192 X. Notice that on Xi,r , all the\nmaps Ej \u2192 Ei can be factored through the subbundle S \u2282 Ei . Using the factored\nmaps, we obtain an induced representation E\u2022\u2032 over Xi,r on vector bundles given by\nEj\u2032 = Ej for j 6= i and Ei\u2032 = S.\nMore generally, let i = (i1 , . . . , im ) be a sequence of quiver vertices and r =\n(r1 , . P\n. . , rm ) a sequence of positive integers, such that for each i \u2208 Q0 we have\nei \u2265 ij =i rj . We can iterate the above construction and define\nXi,r = Xi,r (E\u2022 ) = (* * * ((Xi1 ,r1 )i2 ,r2 ) * * * )im ,rm .\n\nThe variety (Xi1 ,r1 )i2 ,r2 is constructed using the induced representation E\u2022\u2032 on\nXi1 ,r1 , etc. Let \u03c0 : Xi,r \u2192 X denote the projection. In general, this map may\nhave fibers of positive dimension.\nNow let Q be a quiver of Dynkin type and let \u03a6+ \u2282 Nn be the set of positive\nroots for the underlying Dynkin diagram. Here we identify the simple roots with\nthe unit vectors \u01ebi \u2208 Nn , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n. According to Gabriel's classification [22],\nthere is a unique indecomposable representation of Q with dimension vector \u03b1 for\nevery positive root \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a6+ , and all indecomposable representations have this form.\n+\nThis implies that the G-orbits in V correspond to sequences (m\u03b1 ) \u2208 N\u03a6 for which\nP\nm\u03b1 \u03b1 is equal to the dimension vector e. Furthermore, since the number of orbits\nis finite, it follows that every quiver cycle in V is anP\norbit closure.P\nn\nFor dimension vectors \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 Nn , let h\u03b1, \u03b2i =\na\u2208Q1 \u03b1t(a) \u03b2h(a)\ni=1 \u03b1i \u03b2i \u2212\n\u2032\n+\ndenote the Euler form for Q.

For each j \u2208 [1, s], write \u03b1\u2208Ij m\u03b1 \u03b1 = (pj1 , . . . , pjn ) \u2208 Nn . Then let\n\nij = (i1 , . . . , il ) be any sequence of the vertices i \u2208 Q0 for which pji 6= 0, with no\nvertices repeated, and ordered so that the tail of any arrow of Q comes before the\nhead. Set rj = (pji1 , . . . , pjil ). Finally, let i and r be the concatenated sequences\ni = i1 i2 * * * is and r = r1 r2 * * * rs .

Then the map \u03c0 : Vi,r (E\ne\nis a birational isomorphism of Vi,r (E\u2022 ) with \u03a9.\n\nWe note that Reineke's paper [31] states this theorem only in the case where\nthe resolution pair (i, r) is constructed from a directed partition of the set of all\npositive roots \u03a6+ , but the proof covers the more general statement.\nOur formula for quiver coefficients given in the next section uses a resolution\npair (i, r) and requires a number of steps proportional to the common length of\ni and r. It is therefore desirable to make these sequences as short as possible.\n\n\fQUIVER COEFFICIENTS OF DYNKIN TYPE\n\n17\n\nOne reasonable choice is to take the minimal set \u03a6\u2032 = {\u03b1 : m\u03b1 6= 0} and use the\nfollowing 'greedy' algorithm to produce a shortest possible directed partition of \u03a6\u2032 .\nDefine I(\u03a6\u2032 ) to be the (unique) largest subset of \u03a6\u2032 for which every element \u03b1 in\nI(\u03a6\u2032 ) satisfies that h\u03b1, \u03b2i \u2265 0 for all \u03b2 \u2208 \u03a6\u2032 , and h\u03b2, \u03b1i \u2264 0 for all \u03b2 \u2208 \u03a6\u2032 r I(\u03a6\u2032 ).\nThis set can be constructed by starting with all roots \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a6\u2032 for which the first\ninequality holds, and then discarding roots until the second inequality is satisfied.\nSince at least one directed partition for \u03a6\u2032 exists, it follows that I(\u03a6\u2032 ) 6= \u2205. We\nnow obtain a shortest possible directed partition of \u03a6\u2032 by setting I1 = I(\u03a6\u2032 ),\nI2 = I(\u03a6\u2032 r I1 ), I3 = I(\u03a6\u2032 r (I1 \u222a I2 )), etc.\nExample 5.2.

Let Q be a quiver of Dynkin type, \u03a9 \u2282 V an orbit closure, and\nQ,e\n(i, r) a resolution pair for \u03a9. If \u03a9 has rational singularities then P\u03a9 = Pi,r\n, or\nequivalently, the quiver coefficients of \u03a9 are given by c\u03bc (\u03a9) = c\u03bc (i, r). Furthermore,\nthis identity is true for all cohomological quiver coefficients, without the assumption\nabout rational singularities.\nProof. If X is a non-singular variety, then it follows from Reineke's theorem that\ne is a desingularization of the translated degeneracy locus \u03a9\ne \u2282 V.\n\u03c0 : Vi,r (Ee\u2022 ) \u2192 \u03a9\nIf \u03a9 has rational singularities, then \u03c0\u2217 ([OVi,r ]) = [O\u03a9\ne ] \u2208 K\u25e6 (V), so the corollary\nfollows by comparing Theorem 6.1 to Corollary 4.3. Without this assumption, we\ne in the Chow ring of V, which suffices to determine the\nstill have \u03c0\u2217 [Vi,r ] = [\u03a9]\ncohomological quiver coefficients.\n\u0003\nRemark 6.3. If \u03a9 \u2282 V is an orbit closure of Dynkin type, then the quiver coefficients for \u03a9 are identical to the quiver coefficients for \u03a9 = \u03a9\u00d7Spec(K) Spec(K), where\nK is an algebraic closure of K. Corollary 6.2 therefore applies also if \u03a9 has rational\nsingularities, which has been proved for quivers of type A in any characteristic and\nfor quivers of type D in characteristic zero [27, 1, 2].\n\nWe have computed the coefficients c\u03bc (i, r) for lots of randomly chosen quivers Q\nand sequences i and r, and in all cases they had alternating signs in the following\nsense.\nP\n\nConjecture 6.4.

However, we also found examples where the lowest degree coefficients\nwere negative, the next degree up were positive, etc. We speculate that in many\nexamples, the class \u03c0\u2217 ([OVi,r ]) has been equal to the Grothendieck class of the\nimage of \u03c0, which is always a quiver cycle in V . We therefore regard our verification of Conjecture 6.4 as additional evidence for Conjecture 1.1. For the proof of\nTheorem 6.1, we need the following Gysin formula from [8, Thm. 7.3].\nTheorem 6.5.

For applications of our formula, it would be useful to know the\nreduced equations generating the ideal of an orbit closure \u03a9 \u2282 V for a quiver Q of\nDynkin type. For example, such equations will result in a more explicit construction\nof the degeneracy loci \u03a9(E\u2022 ) defined by \u03a9.\nLet \u03c6 \u2208 V be a representation of Q on the vector spaces E1 , . . . , En , and fix another representation \u03c8 = (\u03c8a )a\u2208Q1 on vector spaces F1 , . . . , Fn . A homomorphism\nfrom \u03c8 to \u03c6 is a collection \u03b2 of linear maps \u03b2i : Fi \u2192 Ei such that \u03c6a \u03b2t(a) = \u03b2h(a) \u03c8a\nas a map from Ft(a) to Eh(a) for all a \u2208 Q1 . Let Hom(\u03c8, \u03c6) denote the vector space\nof all such homomorphisms.

Now let Q = {1 \u2190 2 \u2192 3} be the quiver of type A3\nwith both arrows pointing away from the center, and let \u03a9 \u2282 V be the orbit closure\n+\ncorresponding to the sequence (mij ) \u2208 N\u03a6 , where \u03a6+ = {\u03b1ij | 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 3}.\nLet R = (m22 )m13 be the rectangle with m13 rows and m22 columns. For partitions\n2\n\u03bb, \u03bc, \u03bd, we let dR\n\u03bb,\u03bc,\u03bd denote the 2-fold coproduct coefficients defined by \u2206 (GR ) =\nP\nR\n\u03bb,\u03bc,\u03bd d\u03bb,\u03bc,\u03bd G\u03bb \u2297 G\u03bc \u2297 G\u03bd .\nProposition 7.4. The coefficient dR\n\u03bb,\u03bc,\u03bd is zero unless \u03bb, \u03bc, and \u03bd are contained\nin R, in which case it is equal to (\u22121)|\u03bb|+|\u03bc|+|\u03bd|\u2212m22 m13 times the number of triples\n(\u03c3, \u03c4, T ), where \u03c3 and \u03c4 are partitions such that \u03c3 \u2282 \u03c4 \u2282 R, and T is a set-valued\ntableau of skew shape \u03c4 /\u03c3, satisfying the following conditions.\n(i) The Young diagram \u03c3 is contained in \u03bb, and \u03bb/\u03c3 is a rook-strip.\n(ii) If \u03c4 is placed in the upper-left corner of R and the 180 degree rotation of \u03bd\nis placed in the lower-right corner, then their union is R and their overlap\nis a rook-strip.\n(iii) The word w(T ) is a reverse lattice word with content \u03bc.\n\n\fQUIVER COEFFICIENTS OF DYNKIN TYPE\n\n23\n\nP\nProof. It follows from [9, Lemma 6.1] that \u22062 (GR ) = (\u22121)|\u03bb|+|\u03c4 /\u03c3|+|\u03bd|\u2212|R| G\u03bb \u2297\nG\u03c4 /\u03c3 \u2297 G\u03bd , where the sum is over all partitions \u03bb, \u03c3, \u03c4, \u03bc \u2282 R satisfying (i) and (ii).\nThe coefficient of G\u03bc in G\u03c4 /\u03c3 is equal to (\u22121)|\u03bc|\u2212|\u03c4 /\u03c3| times the number of set-valued\ntableaux T of shape \u03c4 /\u03c3 satisfying (iii) by [9, Thm. 6.9].\n\u0003\nTheorem 7.5.

We use the directed partition \u03a6+ = {\u03b111 } \u222a {\u03b133 , \u03b123 , \u03b113 } \u222a {\u03b122 , \u03b112 }, and\nresolution pair i = (1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1) and r = (m11 , m23 +m13 , m13 , e3 , m22 +m12 , m12 ).\nGiven a non-singular variety X with vector bundles E1 , E2 , E3 of ranks e1 , e2 , e3 ,\nform the product P = Fl(m12 , m12 + m13 ; E1 ) \u00d7V Gr(m22 + m12 , E2 ) \u2192 V, with\ne \u2282V\nuniversal subbundles E1\u2032\u2032 \u2282 E1\u2032 \u2282 E1 and E2\u2032 \u2282 E2 . The desingularization of \u03a9\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\ncorresponding to (i, r) is the iterated zero section Vi,r = Z(E2 \u2192 E1 /E1 \u2295 E3 ) \u2282\nZ(E2 \u2192 E1 /E1\u2032 ) \u2282 P .
