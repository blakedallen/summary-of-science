Brandt\n\n1. Introduction\nFormation of a flux-tube between a quark and an antiquark in the QCD vacuum plays an\nimportant role in the description of the still unsolved phenomenon of quark confinement. At a large\ndistance R between the quarks, it is believed that the QCD flux tube has quite a similar behavior to\nan oscillating bosonic string, largely independent of the internal gluonic degrees of freedom which\nmake up the flux tube.\nThis led to the formulation of effective string theories for the flux tube [1] and a lot of studies\nhave dealt with the groundstate of the string [2]. The simplest model describing the excited states of\nthe string is that of the free bosonic string. A more realistic model is provided by the Nambu string\ntheory. An important development by Arvis [3] was the writing down of a qq\u0304 potential assuming\nthe flux tube to be described by a Nambu string.\nNevertheless the Nambu theory still has the conformal anomaly in anything other than 26\ndimensions. This has led to several other proposals for effective string theories. L\u00fcscher and\nWeisz [4] imposed an open- closed duality on the string partition function and obtained the Nambu\nstring spectrum up to order 1/R3 . Another effective string theory introduced by Polchinski and\nStrominger [5] consists of the most general terms at every order in 1/R, which does not introduce\nthe conformal anomaly. In this theory too the string spectrum agrees with Arvis up to corrections\nof order 1/R5 [6]. For a recent review see [7].\nIn this article we look at the excitation spectrum of the flux tube formed between a static quark\nand an antiquark in 3 dimensional SU(2) lattice gauge theory and compare our results with the\npredictions for open bosonic string spectra. For a similar study in the closed string sector see [8].\n\n2. Sources and excited states\nIn 2+1 dimensions, the energy states of the oscillating string can be classified by parity and\ncharge-conjugation properties, (C, P), and one can identify the ground states in these channels with\nthe lowest four energy states of the string:\nE0 \u2194 (+, +) E1 \u2194 (+, \u2212) E2 \u2194 (\u2212, \u2212) E3 \u2194 (\u2212, +)\n\n(2.1)\n\nOur goal is now to measure these energy states on the lattice.\nThe groundstate of the potential can be measured well with Polyakov loop correlators, which\nhave the spectral representation hP(R, T ) P(0, T )i = \u2211\u221e\nn=0 bn exp [\u2212En (R) T ] . In this case the coefficients bn are integers and En (R) are the energy states at quark separation R. Effective string\nprediction for ground state V (R) = E0 (R) is\n1\n1\n\u03c0\nln hP(R, T ) P(0, T )i = V0 + \u03c3 R \u2212 (d \u2212 2) + . . .\nT \u2192\u221e T\n24\nR\n\nV (R) = \u2212 lim\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhere V0 is an unphysical constant and \u03c3 is the string tension. The 1/R term is the well known\nL\u00fcscher-term [9], reproduced by all effective string theories. Different models however give different predictions for the excitation spectrum and therefore one way to distinguish between different\nstring-models is to measure the energy-differences between the excited states.\nThe Polyakov loop correlators used to calculate the groundstate of the potential are bad estimators for the excited states. A better way of measuring the excited states is provided by Wilson\n2\n\n\fL\u00fcscher-Weisz algorithm for excited states of the QCD flux-tube\n\nBastian B.

However normal Wilson loops, with straight spatial lines at the ends, will again project\nstrongly on the ground state, but weakly on the excited states. In order to get a preferential coupling to the excited states, we use a set of wavefunctions at the ends of the loops, called sources.\nThese sources correspond to spatial lines on the lattice, that replace the straight spatial lines of the\nWilson loops. The set of sources we use is shown in figure (1).\nIf one creates superpositions of these sources with well defined parity and charge conjugation,\nthese 'channels' couple directly to the excited states according to equation 2.1. The superpositions\nare shown in table (1).\nThere have been other attempts to measure the excited states. Juge, Kuti and Morningstar [10]\nused asymmetric lattices with small physical temporal extent and a large number of basis states to\nmeasure the excited states in different field theories. In that respect our approach is complementary\nto theirs, as we use relatively few basis states, but use much larger physical temporal extents to\nexponentially suppress the contamination due to excited states.\nWe can now calculate the expectation values of Wilson loops W K (R, T ) with channel K at the\nends, which has the representation:\n\u0010\n\u0011\nK\nK\n(2.3)\nW K (R, T ) = \u03b1 K e\u2212E (R) T 1 + \u03b2 K e\u2212\u2206E (R) T + . . .\nThus we are able to measure the different energy states with the formula:\n\u0014 K\n\u0015\nW (R, T2 )\n1\nK\nE (R) = \u2212\nln\n+ corrections\nT2 \u2212 T1\nW K (R, T1 )\n3\n\n(2.4)\n\n\fL\u00fcscher-Weisz algorithm for excited states of the QCD flux-tube\n\nBastian B. Brandt\n\nThe \"corrections\" in this expression are due to the higher states in the channel and, as can be seen\nfrom equation (2.3) are exponentially damped with T1 and T2 . This is why one would like to go to\nWilson loops with large time extends.\nThe problem with large Wilson loops is of course the very small signal to noise ratio.\nEven for the numerical cheap SU (2) LGT in d=2+1, conventional methods do not work. One\nway of reducing the error is provided by the L\u00fcscher-Weisz algorithm [11], which leads to an\nexponential error reduction for the time transporters of the Wilson loops. Putting the sources on\nfixed time-slices of the lattice and using the sublattice updates to reduce the fluctuations of the\ntime transporters produces good results and is practicable for loops with time extends up to about\na Fermi, see [12].\nHowever this is not the best way to use the algorithm because the fluctuations of the sources\nare not reduced with this method.\n\n3. The new method\nTo achieve further error reduction we now move the sources from the fixed lines to the middle\nof the time slices. Such a Wilson loop with sources at the ends is also shown in figure (1).\nMain advantages of such a procedure are:\n\u2022 The fluctuations of the sources are reduced by the sublattice updates as well.\n\u2022 One can use multihit on single links of the sources that leads to a further error reduction.\nIt is also beneficial to use different numbers of sublattice updates for the time slices that contain\nthe sources and the time slices that contain only time-transporters. In this way it is possible to\nchoose parameters for the algorithm to optimize the noise to speed ratio for the single parts of the\nWilson loops.\nSeveral tests show, that it is good to use more sublattice updates for the sources than for the\ntime transporters for excited states. If one chooses the right parameters for the sources and the time\nslices, one is able to achieve an error reduction of O(10) for the same computation time.\nA related algorithm was used by Kratochvila and de Forcrand to look at string breaking with\nWilson loops [13].\n\n4. First results\nIn our first run we worked on a 243 -lattice for R = 4 \u2212 9 and on a 483 -lattice for R = 10 \u2212 12,\nwith \u03b2 = 5 (r0 = 3.9536(3)), made 2000 total measurements using the scheme of sublattice updates\nshown in table (1). Compared to [12] we were able to increase the time extent of the loops from\nT = 2, 4, 6, 8 to T = 4, 6, 8, 12.\nThe naive energies are calculated with the formula:\n\u0014\n\u0015\nW\u03b1 (R, T2 )\n1\nln\nwith T1 and T2 = 4 and 8\n(4.1)\nE\u03b1 (R) = \u2212\nT2 \u2212 T1\nW\u03b1 (R, T1 )\nTo get rid of the contamination due to the higher states in the channels, we use a fit to the form\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0011i\n\u0010\nh\n1\nW\u03b1 (R, T2 )\n1\n(4.2)\na e\u2212b T1 1 \u2212 e\u2212b (T2 \u2212T1 ) ,\n\u2212\nln\n= \u0112\u03b1 (R) +\nT2 \u2212 T1\nW\u03b1 (R, T1 )\nT2 \u2212 T1\n4\n\n\fL\u00fcscher-Weisz algorithm for excited states of the QCD flux-tube\n\nBastian B.

Conclusions\nWe have discussed an algorithm that allows us to use the advantage of the L\u00fcscher-Weisz\nalgorithm for the time transporters as well as for the sources and we presented our first results\nusing the algorithm. We were able to go to much bigger Wilson loops than was possible previously.\nWe see from figure (3) that at the same qq\u0304 separation R the energy difference \u2206\u011210 is much closer\nto the predictions from Arvis than the energy differences \u2206\u011220 and \u2206\u011230 , which agrees with the\nexpactations in [4]. Also the magnitude of the corrections seems to be larger for the higher states.\nUnfortunately the error reduction obtained with the naive states is not sufficient to get a signal for\nthe third excited state beyond T = 8. At the moment it is not clear whether this is due to lack of\nstatistics or poor choice of parameters in the multilevel algorithm. Investigation into this issue is\nongoing.\n\nAcknowledgments\nAll results were obtained employing the condor sytem\n1 Copyright:\n\n1\n\n[14] to make efficient use of the\n\n1990-2007 Condor-Team, Computer Sciences Department, University of Wisconsin \u2013 Madison, WI.\n\n6\n\n\fL\u00fcscher-Weisz algorithm for excited states of the QCD flux-tube\n\nBastian B.
