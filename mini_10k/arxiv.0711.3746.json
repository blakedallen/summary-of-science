Given a smooth\nvector field V and tensor field \u03c6, the Lie derivative LV \u03c6 is certainly an intrinsic or invariant\nconstruction. In practise, we can take this to mean that the result is independent of any local\nco\u00f6rdinate formula that may be used. Alternatively, we may employ an arbitrary torsion-free\naffine connection \u2207 to write explicit formulae such as\nL\n\nV\n\u03c6bc 7\u2212\u2192\nV a \u2207a \u03c6bc + (\u2207b V a )\u03c6ac + (\u2207c V a )\u03c6ba ,\n\n(1)\n\nchecking that the result is independent of the connection used. In this formula, the indices are\n'abstract indices' in the sense of Penrose [18]. It follows that the expression is co\u00f6rdinate-free\nwhilst its freedom from choice of connection follows immediately from the formulae\nb a V c = \u2207a V c + \u0393ab c V b\n\u2207\n\nand\n\nb a \u03c6bc = \u2207a \u03c6bc \u2212 \u0393ab d \u03c6dc \u2212 \u0393ac d \u03c6bd ,\n\u2207\n\n(2)\n\ncapturing all possible torsion-free connections via the choice of tensor \u0393ab c = \u0393ba c . For further\ndetails on this point of view, see [18].\nWriting the Lie derivative as LV \u03c6 suggests that we are regarding it as a linear differential\noperator acting on the tensor field \u03c6 for a fixed choice of vector field V . However, it is clear\nfrom expressions such as (1) that we may equally well fix \u03c6 and regard the result as a linear\ndifferential operator acting on vector fields V . Sometimes, this is the natural viewpoint. For\nexample, if \u03c6ab is symmetric then we may rewrite (1) as\n(LV \u03c6)bc = \u03c6bc \u2207a V c + \u03c6ac \u2207b V c + (\u2207c \u03c6ab )V c\nand now if \u03c6ab is a metric and we choose \u2207a to be its Levi-Civita connection, then\nLV \u03c6 = 0 \u21d0\u21d2 \u2207a Vb + \u2207b Va = 0,\n\u22c6\nThis paper is a contribution to the Proceedings of the Seventh International Conference \"Symmetry in\nNonlinear Mathematical Physics\" (June 24\u201330, 2007, Kyiv, Ukraine).

Of course,\nthe best way of viewing LV \u03c6 is as a bilinear differential operator or as a differential pairing. It\nis invariantly defined on any manifold and is an example of the subject matter of this article.\nOne can easily imagine other expressions along the lines of the right hand side of (1) that\nturn out to be independent of choice of connection. Restricting the choice of connection leads\nto a greater range of expressions that might be invariant. In the next two sections we shall find\nexamples that are invariant when the connections are deemed to be Levi-Civita connections for\nmetrics taken from a fixed conformal class.\n\n2\n\nFirst order symmetries\n\nSuppose L : E \u2192 F is a linear differential operator between vector bundles E and F . A linear\ndifferential operator D : E \u2192 E is said to be a symmetry of L if and only if\nLD = \u03b4L\n\nfor some linear differential operator \u03b4 : F \u2192 F.\n\nWhen L is the Laplacian on R3 (and the bundles E and F are trivial), its first order symmetries\nare well-known [17]. Specifically, they comprise an 11-dimensional vector space spanned by the\nfollowing\nf 7\u2192 f,\n\nf 7\u2192\n\n\u2202f\n,\n\u2202x\n\n\u2202f\n\u2202f\n\u2212y ,\n\u2202y\n\u2202x\n\u2202f\n\u2202f\n\u2212z ,\nf 7\u2192 y\n\u2202z\n\u2202y\n\u2202f\n\u2202f\nf 7\u2192 z\n\u2212x ,\n\u2202x\n\u2202z\nf 7\u2192 x\n\n\u2202f\n\u2202f\n\u2202f\n+y\n+z ,\n\u2202x\n\u2202y\n\u2202z\n\u2202f\n\u2202f\n\u2202f\nf 7\u2192 (x2 \u2212 y 2 \u2212 z 2 )\n+ 2xy\n+ 2xz\n+ xf,\n\u2202x\n\u2202y\n\u2202z\n\u2202f\n\u2202f\n\u2202f\nf 7\u2192 (y 2 \u2212 z 2 \u2212 x2 )\n+ 2yz\n+ 2yx\n+ yf,\n\u2202y\n\u2202z\n\u2202x\n\u2202f\n\u2202f\n\u2202f\nf 7\u2192 (z 2 \u2212 x2 \u2212 y 2 )\n+ 2zx\n+ 2zy\n+ zf,\n\u2202z\n\u2202x\n\u2202y\nf 7\u2192\n\n\u2202f\n,\n\u2202y\n\nf 7\u2192\n\n\u2202f\n,\n\u2202z\n\nf 7\u2192 x\n\n(3)\n\nwhere x, y, z are the usual Euclidean co\u00f6rdinates on R3 . Following [10], it is convenient to\nrewrite the general first order symmetry as\nf 7\u2192 V a \u2207a f + 16 (\u2207a V a )f + Cf,\nwhere V a is an arbitrary vector field of the form\nV a = \u2212sa \u2212 ma b xb + \u03bbxa + rb xb xa \u2212 12 xb xb r a\n\n(4)\n\nand C is an arbitrary constant. In fact, vector fields of the form (4) on Rn are precisely the\nconformal Killing fields, i.e. the solutions of the equation\n\u2207a Vb + \u2207b Va = n2 gab \u2207c Vc ,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere gab is the usual Euclidean metric on Rn . More generally, on Rn the first order symmetries\nof the Laplacian may be written as f 7\u2192 DV f + Cf , where\nDV f \u2261 V a \u2207a f +\n\na\nn\u22122\n2n (\u2207a V )f\n\n(6)\n\nfor an arbitrary conformal Killing field V a . This expression certainly resembles the Lie derivative\nand we now make this precise as follows. If \u03c6bc***de is an n-form, then\n\u0003\n\u0002\n0 = (n + 1)(\u2207[a V a )\u03c6bc***de] = (\u2207a V a )\u03c6bc***de \u2212 (\u2207b V a )\u03c6ac***de + * * * + (\u2207e V a )\u03c6bc***da ,\n\n\fSymmetries and Invariant Differential Pairings\n\n3\n\nwhere we are following [18] in employing square brackets to denote the result of skewing over\nthe indices they enclose and also noting that a skew tensor with n + 1 indices on Rn necessarily\nvanishes. Hence, the Lie derivative on n-forms simplifies:\nLV \u03c6bc***de = V a \u2207a \u03c6bc***de + (\u2207b V a )\u03c6ac***de + * * * + (\u2207e V a )\u03c6bc***da\n= V a \u2207a \u03c6bc***de + (\u2207a V a )\u03c6bc***de .\nThus, if h is a section of the bundle \u039bn of n-forms, then\nLV h = V a \u2207a h + (\u2207a V a )h.\nTherefore, the expression (6) coincides with the Lie derivative if f is interpreted as a section of the\nline bundle (\u039bn )(n\u22122)/2n (supposing that the manifold is orientable so that such fractional powers\nare allowed). In particular, we deduce that [DV , DW ] = D[V,W ] , as is also readily verified by\ndirect computation. Also we conclude that, with this interpretation, the differential pairing DV f\nbetween V a and f is invariant in the sense discussed for Lie derivative in Section 1.\n\n3\n\nConformal geometry\n\nAn alternative viewpoint on these matters is as follows. If \u2207a is the Levi-Civita connection for\nb a for the conformally related metric gbab = \u03a92 gab\na metric gab , then the Levi-Civita connection \u2207\nis given on 1-forms by\nb a \u03c6b = \u2207a \u03c6b \u2212 \u03a5a \u03c6b \u2212 \u03a5b \u03c6a + \u03a5c \u03c6c gab ,\n\u2207\n\n(7)\n\n\u0393ab c = \u03a5a \u03b4b c + \u03a5b \u03b4a c \u2212 gab \u03a5c\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \u03a5a = \u2207a log \u03a9 and \u03a5c = gcd \u03a5d . Thus, associated with a conformal class of metrics we\nhave a restricted supply of torsion-free connections related by formulae such as (2) where\n\nfor closed 1-forms \u03a5a . It is convenient introduce a line bundle L on a general conformal manifold\nas follows. A choice of metric gab in the conformal class trivialises L, allowing us to view a\nsection of L as a function f . We decree, however, that viewing the same section by means of\nthe trivialisation due to gbab = \u03a92 gab gives us the function fb = \u03a9f . More generally, sections of\nthe bundle Lw transform by fb = \u03a9w f and are called conformal densities of conformal weight w.\nSince\n\u2207a fb = \u2207a (\u03a9w f ) = \u03a9w (\u2207a f + w\u03a5a f )\n\nwe may view Lw as equipped with a family of connections related by\nb a f = \u2207a f + w\u03a5a f.\n\u2207\n\n(9)\n\nOn an oriented conformal n-manifold, the line bundle \u039bn is also trivialised by a choice of metric.\nSpecifically, we may use the inverse metric gab to raise indices and then normalise the volume\nform \u01ebbc***de so that \u01ebbc***de \u01ebbc***de = n!. Since b\ngab = \u03a9\u22122 g ab it follows that b\n\u01ebbc***de = \u03a9n \u01ebbc***de and\nn\n\u2212n\nhence that we may identify \u039b = L . It is easily confirmed that (7) implies\nb a \u03c6bc***de = \u2207a \u03c6bc***de \u2212 n\u03a5a \u03c6bc***de\n\u2207\n\nfor n-forms \u03c6bc***de , which is consistent with (9) for w = \u2212n, as it should be. Combining (7)\nand (9) gives us a formula for the change of connection on \u039b1 \u2297 Lw , namely\nb a \u03c6b = \u2207a \u03c6b + (w \u2212 1)\u03a5a \u03c6b \u2212 \u03a5b \u03c6a + \u03a5c \u03c6c gab .\n\u2207\n\n\f4\n\nM.G.

This is\nY \u2261 \u2206 \u2212 4(n\u22121)\nthe conformal Laplacian or Yamabe operator. The peculiar multiple of the scalar curvature that\nmust be added to the Laplacian to achieve conformal invariance is often referred to a curvature\ncorrection term.\nNow we are in a position to compare with the first order symmetries of the Laplacian on Rn\nfound in Section 2. Of course, the curvature correction terms are absent for the flat metric\non Rn . Therefore, there is no difference between the Laplacian and the Yamabe operator\nprovided we restrict our attention to conformal rescalings that take the flat metric to another\nflat metric. But flat-to-flat rescalings are precisely what are provided by the conformal Killing\nfields (5). Specifically, the conformal Killing fields are those vector fields whose flows preserve\nthe conformal structure on Rn and, moreover, the flat-to-flat conformal factors generated in this\nway are general [2]. The conformal invariance of the Yamabe operator on a general conformal\nmanifold therefore implies the invariance of the Laplacian on Rn under Lie derivative LV for\nconformal Killing fields V . Here, as we have just seen, LV should be interpreted as acting on\nthe bundles L1\u2212n/2 and L\u22121\u2212n/2 . At the end of Section 2 we found that the symmetry DV given\nby (6) may be regarded as the Lie derivative on (\u039bn )(n\u22122)/2n . These viewpoints now coincide\nbecause\n\u039bn = L\u2212n =\u21d2 (\u039bn )(n\u22122)/2n = L1\u2212n/2 .\nThe same reasoning applies more generally. The geometric interpretation of conformal Killing\nfields combines with the conformal invariance of the Yamabe operator and we have proved:\n\n\fSymmetries and Invariant Differential Pairings\n\n5\n\nTheorem 1. Suppose that V a is a conformal Killing field on a Riemannian manifold, i.e.\na solution of the equation (5). Then DV given by (6) is a symmetry of the Yamabe operator.\nMore precisely,\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0011\nn\u22122\nn\u22122\n\u2206 \u2212 4(n\u22121)\nR DV = \u03b4V \u2206 \u2212 4(n\u22121)\nR ,\nwhere\nDV = V a \u2207a +\n\na\nn\u22122\n2n (\u2207a V )\n\nand\n\n\u03b4V = V a \u2207a +\n\na\nn+2\n2n (\u2207a V ).\n\nIn fact, it follows from proof of [10, Theorem 1] that these are the only symmetries of the\nYamabe operator.\nWe have already observed that the differential pairing DV f given by (6) is invariant in the\nvery strong sense of being intrinsically defined on any manifold. Conformal invariance is a\nweaker statement but one that is easily verified directly. From (2) and (8),\nb a V b = \u2207a V b + \u03a5a V b \u2212 \u03a5b Va + \u03a5c V c \u03b4a b =\u21d2 \u2207\nb a V a = \u2207a V a + n\u03a5a V a\n\u2207\nwhilst for f a density of weight w we have (9). It follows immediately that\nV a \u2207a f \u2212\n\nw\na\nn (\u2207a V )f\n\n(12)\n\nis a conformally invariant differential pairing and for w = 1 \u2212 n/2 this agrees with (6).\n\n4\n\nHigher order symmetries\n\nThere are some second order symmetries of the Laplacian on Rn that should be regarded as\ntrivial. If D = h\u2206 for some smooth function h, then \u2206D = \u03b4\u2206 simply by taking \u03b4f = \u2206(hf ).\nAll symmetries preserve harmonic functions but D = h\u2206 does this by dint of annihilating them.\nIgnoring these trivial symmetries, the second order symmetries of the Laplacian in R3 were\nfound by Boyer, Kalnins, and Miller [3]. They add an extra 35 dimensions to the 11-dimensional\nspace (3). In [10] all higher symmetries were found in all dimensions and, ignoring the trivial\nones, there is an additional finite-dimensional space of second order ones. More precisely, there\nare second order symmetries\nDV f = V ab \u2207a \u2207b f +\n\nab\nn\nn+2 (\u2207a V )\u2207b f\n\n+\n\n(n\u22122)n\nab\n4(n+1)(n+2) (\u2207a \u2207b V )f\n\n(13)\n\nfor any trace-free symmetric tensor V ab satisfying\n\u2207a Vbc + \u2207b Vca + \u2207c Vab =\n\n2\nn+2\n\n\u0001\ngab \u2207d Vcd + gbc \u2207d Vad + gca \u2207d Vbd .\n\n(14)\n\nSuch V ab are called conformal Killing tensors (of valence 2) and on Rn form a vector space of\ndimension\n(n\u22121)(n+2)(n+3)(n+4)\n.\n12\n\nAs detailed in [10], this is the 'additional space' of second order symmetries referred to\nabove. As with first order symmetries (6), the pairing between valence 2 symmetric trace-free\ntensors V ab and densities f of weight 1 \u2212 n/2 given by the right hand side of (13) is conformally\ninvariant under flat-to-flat conformal rescalings. Unlike the first order case, however, the pairing (13) is not invariant under general conformal rescalings of a general Riemannian manifold\n\n\f6\n\nM.G. Eastwood\n\nbut, like the Laplacian, becomes so with the addition of suitable curvature correction terms.\nSpecifically, for V ab any trace-free symmetric contravariant tensor and f of weight w\nV ab \u2207a \u2207b f \u2212\n\n2(w\u22121)\nab\nn+2 (\u2207a V )\u2207b f\n\n+\n\nw(w\u22121)\nab\n(n+1)(n+2) (\u2207a \u2207b V )f\n\n+\n\nw(n+w)\nab\n(n+1)(n\u22122) Rab V f,\n\n(15)\n\nwhere Rab is the Ricci tensor, is a conformally invariant differential pairing on an arbitrary\nRiemannian manifold.

Whether this operator\nactually provides a symmetry of the Yamabe operator in general, however, is unclear.

The problem is that there does not seem to be any useful geometric\ninterpretation of V ab being a conformal Killing tensor in parallel to V a being a conformal Killing\nfield. In principle, the validity or otherwise of (16) should boil down to a calculation once the\ndifferential consequences of (14) are determined. Furthermore, the differential consequences\nof (14) can all be found by prolonging the system, as described in [5] for example. Nevertheless,\nit will surely be a difficult calculation.\n\n5\n\nFurther examples of invariant pairings\n\nThe simple conformally invariant pairings we have found so far, namely (12) and (15), may be\nextended by allowing V a and V ab to have a general conformal weight as follows. It is convenient\nto set\n\u03a6ab \u2261\n\n\u0001\n1\nRab \u2212 n1 Rgab .\nn\u22122\n\nProposition 1. Suppose that V a has conformal weight v and f has conformal weight w. Then\n(v + n)V a \u2207a f \u2212 w(\u2207a V a )f\n\n(17)\n\nis conformally invariant. Suppose V ab is trace-free symmetric with conformal weight v and f\nhas conformal weight w. Then\n(n + v + 2)(n + v + 1)V ab \u2207a \u2207b f \u2212 2(w \u2212 1)(n + v + 1)(\u2207a V ab )\u2207b f\n+ w(w \u2212 1)(\u2207a \u2207b V ab )f + w(n + v + w)(n + v + 2)\u03a6ab V ab f\n\n(18)\n\nis conformally invariant.\nProof . These are easily verified using the formulae for conformal rescaling developed in Section 3.\n\u0004\n\n\fSymmetries and Invariant Differential Pairings\n\n7\n\nNotice that there are several special cases occurring for particular values of v and w. The\nform of (17) suggests setting w = 0 or v = \u2212n and, when we do, we find\n(v + n)V a \u2207a f\n\nis invariant\n\n\u2200 V a =\u21d2 f 7\u2192 \u2207a f\n\nis invariant\n\n\u2200 f =\u21d2 V a 7\u2192 \u2207a V a\n\nis invariant.\n\nand\n\u2212w(\u2207a V a )f\n\nis invariant\n\nThese are familiar invariant linear differential operators. The first one is the exterior derivative\nd : \u039b0 \u2192 \u039b1 and the second may be identified as d : \u039bn\u22121 \u2192 \u039bn . More interesting are the\nconsequences of setting w = 1 and v = \u2212n \u2212 1 in (18). We obtain conformally invariant linear\ndifferential operators\nf 7\u2192 \u2207a \u2207b f \u2212 n1 (\u2206f )gab + \u03a6ab f\n\nV ab 7\u2192 \u2207a \u2207b V ab + \u03a6ab V ab ,\n\nand\n\nrespectively.\n\nThe theory of conformally invariant linear differential operators is well understood [1, 4, 12, 14]\nand includes these two as simple examples. Other special values of the weights v and w show\nup as zeroes of the coefficients in (18). We have already seen that for w = 0 there is an\ninvariant differential operator f 7\u2192 \u2207a f . Similarly, for v = \u2212n \u2212 2 the operator V ab 7\u2192 \u2207a V ab\nis conformally invariant.\nIt is also interesting to note that, conversely, we can build the invariant pairing (18) from\nthese various linear invariant operators. Specifically, if V ab has weight v and f has weight w 6= 0\nthen, at least where f does not vanish,\nf \u2212(n+v+1)/w V ab has weight \u2212 n \u2212 1\n\nand\n\nf \u2212(n+v+2)/w V ab has weight \u2212 n \u2212 2.\n\nTherefore,\n\u2207a \u2207b (f \u2212(n+v+1)/w V ab ) + \u03a6ab f \u2212(n+v+1)/w V ab\n\nand\n\n\u2207b (f \u2212(n+v+2)/w V ab )\n\nare invariant. If the second of these is multiplied by f 2/w we obtain a vector field of weight \u2212n\nand conclude that\n\u0001\n\u2207a f 2/w \u2207b (f \u2212(n+v+2)/w V ab )\nis also invariant. It follows, therefore, that the combination\nw(n + v + 2)(n + v + w)f (n+v+1+w)/w \u2207a \u2207b (f \u2212(n+v+1)/w V ab ) + \u03a6ab f \u2212(n+v+1)/w V ab\n\u0001\u0001\n\u2212 w(n + v + 1)(n + v + 1 + w)f (n+v+w)/w \u2207a f 2/w \u2207b (f \u2212(n+v+2)/w V ab )\n\n\u0001\n\nis invariant. A short calculation reveals that this expression agrees with (18) and, although we\nsupposed w 6= 0 and also that f 6= 0 in carrying out this derivation, the final conclusion is valid\nregardless. These tricks reveal some sort of relationship between invariant differential pairings\nand invariant linear differential operators, at least when one of the quantities to be paired is\na conformal density.\nThese tricks are unavailable more generally but there are, nevertheless, many conformally invariant differential pairings. For example, if V ab is symmetric trace-free with conformal weight v\nand \u03c6a has conformal weight w, then\n(n + v + 2)V ab \u2207a \u03c6b \u2212 (w \u2212 2)(\u2207a V ab )\u03c6b .\nis invariant. Operators such as this one and (17) are referred to as first order , not only because\nthere are no higher derivatives involved than first order but also because there are no cross terms\n\n\f8\n\nM.G. Eastwood\n\nof the form \u2207V \u22b2\u22b3 \u2207\u03c6 where \u22b2\u22b3 denotes some algebraic pairing (we shall come back to this point\nsoon). The theory of first order invariant differential pairings on a conformal manifold, or more\ngenerally on a manifold with AHS structure, is reasonably well understood thanks to recent work\nof Kroeske [16]. Following the approach of Fegan [14] in the conformal case and \u010cap, Slov\u00e1k, and\nSou\u010dek [7] more generally, Kroeske classifies the first order invariant pairings provided that the\nweights of the tensors involved are so that invariant linear differential operators are excluded.\nThis corresponds well to the relationship that seemed to be emerging in our examples. For\nhigher order pairings, however, Kroeske [16] finds additional unexpected pairings and is able to\npresent a satisfactory theory only in the flat projective setting.\n\n6\n\nSome precise formulations\n\nWhen E and F are smooth vector bundles on some smooth manifold, it is well-known that linear\ndifferential operators D : E \u2192 F of order \u2264 k are in 1\u20131 correspondence with vector bundle\nhomomorphisms J k E \u2192 F where J k E is the kth jet bundle of E. Indeed, it is usual to abuse\nnotation and also write D : J k E \u2192 F , sometimes adopting this viewpoint as the definition of\na linear differential operator. There are canonical short exact sequences of vector bundles\nJ\n(19)\n0 \u2192 k \u039b1 \u2297 E \u2192 J k E \u2192 J k\u22121 E \u2192 0,\nJ\nwhere k \u039b1 is the bundle of symmetric covariant tensors of valence k and the composition\nJk\n\nD\n\n\u039b1 \u2297 E \u2192 J k E \u2212\u2192 F\n\nis called the symbol of D. For further details, see [19] for example.\nDifferential pairings may be formulated similarly. Suppose another vector bundle V is given\nand we wish to define what is a differential pairing E \u00d7 F \u2192 V . The jet exact sequences (19)\nmay be written as\nJk 1\nJ3 1\nJ2 1\n\u039b \u2297 E,\n\u039b \u2297 E + *** +\n\u039b \u2297E +\nJ k E = E + \u039b1 \u2297 E +\nmeaning that J k E is filtered with successive quotients as shown. It follows that\nJ2 1\n\u039b \u2297E\u2297F\n\u039b1 \u2297 E \u2297 F\n\u2295\nk\nk\n1\nJ E\u2297J F =E\u2297F +\n\u2295\n+ \u039b \u2297 E \u2297 \u039b1 \u2297 F + * * *\n1\nE\u2297\u039b \u2297F\n\u2295\nJ2 1\n\u039b \u2297F\nE\u2297\nand, following [16], we define the bi-jet bundle J k (E, F ) as the quotient of J k E \u2297 J k F corresponding to the first k + 1 columns of this composition series.

Notice that it is the total order of the operator that is constrained to\nbe less than of equal to k. For first order pairings, for example, we are excluding terms of the\nform \u2207\u03c8 \u22b2\u22b3 \u2207\u03c6 (written in the presence of chosen connections). For second order pairings we\nexclude \u22072 \u03c8 \u22b2\u22b3 \u2207\u03c6, \u2207\u03c8 \u22b2\u22b3 \u22072 \u03c6, and \u22072 \u03c8 \u22b2\u22b3 \u22072 \u03c6.

Suppose, for example, that we consider homogeneous vector bundles on\na homogeneous space G/P . If E and F are induced from P -modules E and F, then J k (E, F )\nwill also be induced from a P -module, say J k (E, F). If V is induced from V, a G-invariant\ndifferential pairing will correspond to a P -module homomorphism J k (E, F) \u2192 V. In particular,\nwhen G = SO(n+1, 1) and G/P is the conformal sphere (as detailed in [9] for example) then these\nP -module homomorphisms correspond to flat-to-flat invariant differential pairings. This gives\nan approach to classification as adopted in [16]. Nevertheless, it remains a difficult problem.\n\n7\n\nOther sources of invariant pairings\n\nFirstly, there are other conformally invariant differential operators whose symmetries give rise\nto invariant differential pairings. The square of the Laplacian is treated in [11] and the Dirac\noperator in [13]. There is also another source of pairings derived from the structure of the\nsymmetry algebra as follows. Let us consider the symmetries of the Laplacian as in Sections 2\nand 4. It is clear that the composition of symmetries is again a symmetry. In particular, if we\ncompose two first order symmetries (6) on Rn then we find [10]\nDV DW f = DV \u229aW f + 12 D[V,W ]f \u2212\n\nn\u22122\n4n(n+1) hV, W if\n\n+ n1 V a Wa \u2206f\n\nwhere DV \u229aW is given by (13) and\n(V \u229a W )ab = 12 V a W b + 21 V b W a \u2212 n1 gab V c Wc ,\n[V, W ]a = V b \u2207b V a \u2212 W b \u2207b V a ,\na\nb\nn+2\nn (\u2207a V )(\u2207b W )\n\u2206(Va W a ).\n\nhV, W i = (n + 2)(\u2207b V a )(\u2207a W b ) \u2212\n\u2212\n\na\nb\nn+2\nn W \u2207a \u2207b V\n\n+\n\n\u2212\n\nb\nn+2 a\nn V \u2207a \u2207b W\n\nThe last of these is constant when V a and W a are Killing fields on Rn and in this case coincides\nwith their inner product under the Killing form in so(n + 1, 1).

Further examples are given by Duval and Ovsienko [8] in\nthe conformal case and Fox [15] in the projective case.\nFinally, there is a general construction of invariant pairings for very particular weights called\ncup products by Calderbank and Diemer [6]. This construction applies in any parabolic geometry\nbut further discussion is beyond the scope of this article.\n\n\f10\n\nM.G.
