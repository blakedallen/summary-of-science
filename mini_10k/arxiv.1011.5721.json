The principal obstacle in fabricating\nsuperconducting wires and tapes is grain boundaries\u2013the misalignment of crystalline\norientations at grain boundaries, which is unavoidable for polycrystals, largely\ndeteriorates critical current density. Here, we report that High critical temperature iron\npnictide superconductors have advantages over cuprates with respect to these grain\nboundary issues. The transport properties through well-defined bicrystal grain boundary\njunctions with various misorientation angles (\uf071GB) were systematically investigated for\ncobalt-doped BaFe2As2 (BaFe2As2:Co) epitaxial films fabricated on bicrystal substrates.\nThe critical current density through bicrystal grain boundary (JcBGB) remained high (> 1\nMA/cm2) and nearly constant up to a critical angle \uf071c of ~9o, which is substantially\nlarger than the \uf071c of ~5o for YBa2Cu3O7\u2013\uf064. Even at\uf020\uf071GB > \uf071c, the decay of JcBGB was\nmuch smaller than that of YBa2Cu3O7\u2013\uf064.\n\n2\n\n\fT. Katase et al.\n\nGrain boundary (GB) engineering of high critical temperature (Tc) cuprate\nsuperconductors has been a critical issue in developing practical applications such as\nsuperconducting wires and tapes1, because their superconducting properties heavily\ndepend on the misorientation angle (\uf071GB) at GBs; therefore, grains in cuprate\nsuperconductors must be highly textured to minimize deterioration of the critical current\ndensity (Jc) across misoriented GBs. In a representative cuprate superconductor,\nYBa2Cu3O7\u2013\uf064 (YBCO), a fundamental study of intergrain Jc in bicrystal GBs (JcBGB) has\nbeen performed using several types of bicrystal substrates2. Significantly misaligned\nadjacent grains cause JcBGB to decay exponentially as a function of \uf071GB from 3o to 40o 3.\nTherefore, to produce YBCO superconducting tapes with a high Jc, it is necessary to\ninsert well-aligned buffer layers with a small distribution of in-plane misalignment \uf044\uf066 <\n5o on polycrystalline metal substrates using the ion-beam-assisted deposition (IBAD)\ntechnique4 or rolling-assisted biaxially textured substrates (RABiTS)5. Although recent\nprogress in buffer-layer technology has established \uf044\uf066 < 5o, which provides a self-field\nJc of several MA/cm2 at 77 K6, fabricating such a buffer layer is time-consuming and\nexpensive. The development of new high-Tc and high upper critical magnetic field (Bc2)\nsuperconducting materials with a more gradual JcBGB(\uf071GB) dependence allows for a\nsimple and low-cost fabrication process and provides wider flexibility in\nsuperconductor power lines and their applications.\nIron pnictide superconductors7, 8 have received increasing interest as a new family\nof high-Tc superconductors because they have attractive properties such as a high Tc up\nto 56 K 9 and high Bc2(0) well over 100 T 10, 11. The iron pnictide family shares several\ncharacteristics with the cuprates, such as a layered crystal structure, superconductivity\ninduced by carrier doping and the presence of competing orders. However, there are\n3\n\n\fT. Katase et al.\n\nsome noteworthy differences, such as the metallic nature of normal states of the iron\npnictides instead of the antiferromagnetic Mott insulators of the cuprates, smaller\nanisotropy in superconducting properties, which is primarily due to the multi-pocket\nstructures of their Fermi surfaces, and a highly symmetric order parameter based on\ns-wave instead of a d-wave pairing one12. Therefore, we expect that these characteristics\nof iron pnictides would make them more favorable than cuprates with respect to the\nsupercurrent conduction mechanism in misoriented GBs.\nWe have studied epitaxial films of the AEFe2As2 (AE = Sr and Ba) system13\u201318\nbecause they have considerably small anisotropy \uf067 \uf03d Bc 2\n\nB\uf05ec\n\n/ Bc 2\n\nB // c\n\n= 1.9\u20131.5 in\n\nsuperconducting properties, high Bc2(0) > 50 T and weak thermal fluctuations with a\nGinzburg number Gi of 1.7\u00d710\u20134 among iron pnictide materials19, 20. In particular,\ncobalt-doped BaFe2As2 (BaFe2As2:Co) appears to have great potential for device\napplications15\u201317,21\u201324 because it is rather easy to grow films by pulsed laser deposition\n(PLD) and chemically stable in an ambient atmosphere15. It was previously reported that\nin-field transport properties across bicrystal GBs (BGBs) with 4 different \uf071GB = 3o\u201324o\nformed in BaFe2As2:Co epitaxial films grown on [001]-tilt SrTiO3 (STO) bicrystal\nsubstrates suggested that even low-angle BGB with \uf071GB = 6o obstructs supercurrent and\nthe weak-linked BGBs exhibit a similar behavior to YBCO BGBs22. In this article, we\nreport comprehensive results on transport properties of BaFe2As2:Co BGB junctions\ngrown directly on insulating bicrystal substrates in the full range of \uf071GB from 3o to 45o.\nAmong the results, it is particularly noteworthy that the critical angle \uf071c of ~9o for\nBaFe2As2:Co is much larger than the previously-reported value and the decay slope is\nmuch smaller than that of cuprates. The large \uf071c allows a simpler and lower-cost\nfabrication process of superconducting tapes. This advantageous GB nature is\n4\n\n\fT. Katase et al.\n\ndemonstrated by the high Jc > 1 MA/cm2 of a BaFe2As2:Co superconducting tape\nfabricated on a polycrystalline flexible metal substrate25.\n\nResults\nBaFe2As2:Co bicrystal grain boundary (BGB) junctions. BaFe2As2:Co epitaxial\nfilms with the optimal Co concentration of 8% were fabricated on [001]-tilt bicrystal\nsubstrates of MgO with \uf071GB = 3o\u201345o and (La, Sr)(Al, Ta)O3 (LSAT) with \uf071GB = 5o\u201345o\nby PLD with a Nd:YAG laser (\uf06c = 532 nm) at a substrate temperature of 850 \uf0b0C16. To\ndate, different techniques that employ conductive buffer layers of STO, BaTiO3 23 or Fe\n26\n\nhave been proposed to enhance high-quality epitaxial growth. However, we have\n\nreported that it is possible to grow high-quality BaFe2As2:Co epitaxial films with high\nself-field Jc > 1 MA/cm2 directly on insulating MgO and LSAT single-crystalline\nsubstrates without any buffer layer, which has been achieved by optimizing the growth\nconditions16. The directly grown BaFe2As2:Co films exhibited an onset Tc of 20.7 K for\nMgO bicrystal substrates and 21.6 K for LSAT bicrystal substrates with sharp transition\nwidths (\uf044Tc) of 1.1 K17.\nFigure 1 (a) illustrates the device structure fabricated on [001]-tilt bicrystal\nsubstrates. To perform transport measurements of JcBGB, the BaFe2As2:Co epitaxial\nfilms were patterned into 300-\uf06dm-long, 8-\uf06dm-wide micro-bridge structures. To compare\nthe intergrain Jc (JcBGB) and intragrain Jc (JcGrain), two types of micro-bridges were\nfabricated: one was a 'BGB junction' that contained a BGB each, and the other was a\n'Grain bridge' that did not contain a BGB. \uf020The electrical contacts were formed with In\nmetal pads and Au wires. The current\u2013voltage (I\u2013V) characteristics of BGB junctions\nand Grain bridges were measured by the four-probe method.\n5\n\n\fT. Katase et al.\n\nHigh critical angle of strong-link \u2013 weak-link transition. The correlation between the\ntransport JcBGB and the \uf071GB is the most important index in characterizing the GB\nproperties of superconductors. Figure 1 (b) summarizes the self-field JcBGB(\uf071GB)\nmeasured at 4 K and 12 K, and Figure 1 (c) shows the JcBGB/JcGrain ratio at 4 K. For\ncomparison, the generally accepted average JcBGB(\uf071GB) properties of YBCO BGB\njunctions measured at 4 K and 77 K\n\n2\n\nare also plotted. The JcGrain for all of the\n\nBaFe2As2:Co Grain bridges are greater than 1 MA/cm2 at 4 K and 1.0\u20130.5 MA/cm2 at\n12 K. For the BGB junctions with low \uf071GB \uf0a3 ~9o, the JcBGB/JcGrain ratio remained almost\nat unity, indicating that the low-angle BGB junctions do not behave like a weak link.\nHowever, with the increase in \uf071GB from 9o to 45o, JcBGB decreases to approximately 5%,\nwhich indicates that the transition from the strong link to the weak link occurs at \uf071c of\napproximately 9o. In the YBCO system, the JcBGB values at 4 K for \uf071GB\uf020\uf020< 5o were\nslightly less than the JcGrain values, and the JcBGB values for \uf071GB\uf020> 5o showed a clear\nweak-link behavior2, 27. Although the reported data are somewhat scattered2, the typical\nvalues of \uf071c = 3\u20135o are almost half the magnitude of those obtained for the BaFe2As2:Co\nBGB junctions.\n\nGentle JcBGB decay in weak-link regime. It is well known that the BGB junctions of\nthe cuprates exhibit nearly exponential decay in their JcBGB(\uf071GB) curves in the weak-link\nregime with an empirical equation of Jc0exp(\u2013\uf071GB/\uf0710), where \uf0710 denotes the\ncharacteristic angle. The JcBGB(\uf071GB)\uf020curves are expressed by 3.0\u00d7107exp(\u2013\uf071GB/4.3o) at 4\nK and 7.0\u00d7106exp(\u2013\uf071GB/4.2o) at 77 K. The present BaFe2As2:Co BGB junctions also\nshow an exponential decay, approximated as 2.8\u00d7106exp(\u2013\uf071GB/9.0o) at 4 K (the red line\n6\n\n\fT. Katase et al.\n\nin Fig. 1(b)) and 1.5\u00d7106exp(\u2013\uf071GB/8.5o) at 12 K (the blue line in Fig. 1(b)). It should be\nnoted that the \uf0710 values for the BaFe2As2:Co BGB junctions are twice as large as those\nfor the YBCO BGB junctions, which indicates that the JcBGB(\uf071GB) of the BaFe2As2:Co\nBGB junctions shows a more gradual decrease than that of the YBCO BGB junctions.\nConsequently, the JcBGB of the BaFe2As2:Co BGB junction exceeds that of the YBCO\nBGB junctions at \uf071GB \u2265 20o at 4 K.\n\nBGB junction characteristics. Figure 2 (a) shows the I\u2013V characteristics measured at\n12 K for 8-\uf06dm-wide BGB junctions with \uf071GB = 4o, 16o and 45o. The BGB junction with\n\n\uf071GB = 4o only exhibits a sharp resistivity jump at a large Ic of 50 mA due to the normal\nstate transition. Similar I\u2013V characteristics were observed for all of the BGB junctions\nwith \uf071GB \uf0a3 9o. On the other hand, the I\u2013V curves of BGB junctions with \uf071GB = 16o and\n45o show nonlinear characteristics without hysteresis in the low voltage region. In\ngeneral, the shapes of the I\u2013V curves of BGB junctions depend on the fractions of the\nJosephson current exhibiting resistively shunted junction (RSJ) behavior (WRSJ) and a\nsupercurrent showing flux flow (FF) behavior (WFF). A phenomenological model to\nexplain their fractions in I\u2013V curves was previously proposed as follows.28 I\u2013V curves\nare expressed by the combination of the RSJ and the FF behaviors, where the RSJ\ncurrent\n\nfollows\n\n\uf0e6 V\nI FF \uf03d I S \uf02d A exp \uf0e7\uf0e7 \uf02d\n\uf0e8 V0\n\nI RSJ\n\n\uf0e6\uf0e6 V\n\uf03d \uf0e7 \uf0e7\uf0e7\n\uf0e7 \uf0e8 RN\n\uf0e8\n\n1/ 2\n\n2\n\uf0f6\n\uf0f6\n\uf0f7\uf0f7 \uf02b I c 2 \uf0f7\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f8\n\nand\n\nthe\n\nFF\n\ncurrent\n\nfollows\n\n\uf0f6\n\uf0f7\uf0f7 (RN is the normal-state resistance of the barrier, and IS, A and\n\uf0f8\n\nV0 are constants). The fitting results based on this model drawn by the blue lines\nreproduce the experimental I\u2013V curves well. The fractions of the RSJ current WRSJ are\napproximately 0%, 70% and 100% for the BGB junctions with \uf071GB = 4o, 24o and 45o,\n7\n\n\fT. Katase et al.\n\nrespectively. The 100% RSJ current is further confirmed by good agreement with the\ncommonly used Ambegaokar-Halperin (AH) model29 drawn by the red line for the BGB\njunctions with \uf071GB = 45o. The RSJ behavior in the I\u2013V curves of the BGB junctions with\n\n\uf071GB = 45o was observed in the whole temperature range below Tc. The junction\nresistance RNA, where A is the cross-sectional area of the junction, provides information\non the nature of the barrier in BGB junctions. The RNA products were estimated by\nfitting the above-mentioned model to the experimental I\u2013V curves28. The RNA of the\nBaFe2As2:Co BGB junctions are 5\u00d710\u201311 \uf057cm2 for \uf071GB = 16o and 5\u00d710\u201310 \uf057cm2 for \uf071GB\n= 45o, which are one or two orders of magnitude smaller than those of the YBCO BGB\njunctions (6\u00d710\u20139\u20138\u00d710\u20138 \uf057cm2 for \uf071GB = 16o\u201345o, respectively). These results suggest\nthat\n\nthe\n\nBaFe2As2:Co\n\nBGB\n\njunctions\n\nwork\n\nas\n\nsuperconductor\u2013normal\n\nmetal\u2013superconductor (SNS) junctions. On the other hand, the YBCO BGB junctions\ngenerally show hysteretic I\u2013V curves at low temperatures well below Tc, indicating\nrelatively large junction capacitances and resistances due to the insulating nature of their\njunction barriers. In the case of the BaFe2As2:Co BGB junctions, the nonhysteretic\ncurves, even at low temperatures, suggest the metallic nature of the junction barriers.\nFigures 2 (b) and (c) show the Josephson junction properties of 3-\uf06dm-wide BGB\njunctions with a small \uf071GB = 16o and a large \uf071GB = 45o, respectively. The left figures\nshow the magnetic field B dependencies of Ic (Ic\u2013B) under B applied perpendicular to\nthe film surfaces, and the right figures show the I\u2013V curves of the BGB junctions\nirradiated with microwaves at a frequency of 1.39 GHz for \uf071GB = 16o and 2.0 GHz for\n\n\uf071GB = 45o measured at 16 K. The Ic\u2013B pattern of the BGB junction with \uf071GB = 45o is\ndistinct from the ideal Fraunhofer pattern, probably due to the inhomogeneous current\ndistribution along the BGB; however, the junctions exhibit an Ic modulation of almost\n8\n\n\fT. Katase et al.\n\n100%, which corresponds to the fact that the BGB junction with \uf071GB = 45o exhibits the\n100% RSJ current. The BGB junction with \uf071GB = 16o exhibits an Ic modulation of only\n35% due to the excess current attributable to the FF current. Furthermore, both devices\nclearly show Shapiro steps with periodic current steps. The measured step voltage\nheights of 2.9 \uf06dV for \uf071GB = 16o and 4.1 \uf06dV for \uf071GB = 45o are consistent with the\nJosephson relation VRF \uf03d\n\nnhf RF\n, where\n2e\n\nf RF is the frequency of the applied\n\nmicrowaves.\n\nAtomic structures of BGBs. Here, we examined the microstructure and the local\n\nchemical composition deviation of the BGBs to check the effect of an impurity phase on\nthe weak-link junction behaviors. Figures 3 (a)\u2013(c) show plan-view high-resolution\ntransmission electron microscope (HR-TEM) images of the BaFe2As2:Co BGB\njunctions with \uf071GB = 4o, 24o and 45o, respectively. The [100]-axes of BaFe2As2:Co are\nindicated by the arrows. Symmetrically tilted junctions were formed in almost the entire\nregion of the BGBs for all of the junctions. In the BGB junctions with \uf071GB = 4o and 24o,\nperiodic misfit dislocations at intervals of approximately 5.0 nm for \uf071GB = 4o and 1.2 nm\nfor \uf071GB = 24o are clearly observed along the BGBs. On the other hand, the BGB with\n\n\uf071GB = 45o has blurred lattice fringes across the entire region. Using a geometric tilted\nboundary model, the grain boundary dislocation spacing D is given by\nD \uf03d \uf028 b / 2 \uf029 / sin(\uf071 GB / 2) , where b is the norm of the corresponding Burgers vector3.\n\nWith the lattice constant a = 0.396 nm of BaFe2As230, D is estimated to be 5.7 nm and\n1.0 nm for \uf071GB = 4o and 24o, respectively. The estimated D values are very similar to the\nD values observed above. For \uf071GB = 45o, the D value is estimated to be 0.5 nm. This\n\n9\n\n\fT. Katase et al.\n\nvalue is almost the same as the lattice parameter; therefore, we cannot observe periodic\nmisfit dislocations in the BGB with \uf071GB = 45o in Fig. 3 (c). Energy dispersive\nspectroscopy (EDS) line spectra across the BGBs and parallel to the BGBs confirmed\nthat the chemical compositions of the BGBs and the film region are homogeneous, and\nno secondary phase was observed in the BGB regions.\nNext, we discuss the relationship between \uf071c and the BGB dislocation spacing D\nobserved by TEM. For the BaFe2As2:Co BGB junctions, the observed critical angles \uf071c\nare approximately 9o, which correspond to a D value of approximately 2.8 nm. This is\ncomparable to or slightly larger than the coherence length \uf078ab(T) of 2.6 nm at 4 K\nestimated from the reported \uf078ab(0 K) \uf03d\uf020\uf032\uf02e\uf034 nm for BaFe2As2:Co19. The above\nrelationship supports the notion that strong current channels still remain between the\ndislocations when \uf071GB\uf020is below \uf071c, while coherent superconducting current cannot pass\nthrough the BGBs at \uf071GB\uf020> \uf071c and behaves like a weak link.\nNote that there would be other factors that affect the GB transport properties. For\ninstance, the dislocation cores formed along BGBs can produce residual strains, which\nhave been considered to play one of the major roles in current blocking at BGBs of\ncuprates31,32. This possibility would help us to obtain a more informative insight into the\nweak-link behavior in iron pnictide superconductors; however, further microstructure\nand strain analyses are necessary to evaluate the strain field and discuss their effects.\n\nIn-field characteristics of BGB junctions. To investigate the weak-link behavior in a B,\n\nJcBGB(B) values for the BGB junctions with\uf020\uf071GB = 3o\u201345o were measured at B up to 9 T\napplied parallel to the c-axis. Figure 4 (a) shows the JcBGB(B) curves measured at 4 K,\nand the inset figure shows a magnified view in the low B region up to 0.2 T. The JcGrain\n10\n\n\fT. Katase et al.\n\nmeasured for the Grain bridge on the 3o MgO bicrystal substrate is also plotted by the\nblack squares. For the BGB junctions with \uf071GB = 3o and 4o, the JcBGB(B) values are\nalmost indistinguishable from those of the JcGrain(B) curves, and a reduction in JcBGB is\nnot observed. The other BGB junctions with larger \uf071GB show more rapid decreases than\nthose of the JcGrain(B), even in a low magnetic field. The JcBGB(B) of the BGB junctions\nwith large \uf071GB = 24o and 45o decrease sharply to 2% and 0.8% of the JcGrain(B) upon the\napplication of 0.1 T. For the BGB junctions with \uf071GB = 8o and 11o, the JcBGB(B) curves\nshow an intermediate behavior between the strongly linked and weakly linked states,\nwhere the rapid decrease in JcBGB(B) at < 1 T can be attributed to the weak pinning force\nof the flux trapped at the dislocation cores despite the existence of strong channels with\nalmost the same width as the coherence length \uf078ab(T).\n\nMetallic nature of high-angle BGB junctions. The temperature dependence of JcBGB\n\n(JcBGB(T)) provides more information about the nature of the barriers formed in BGBs.\nIn general, Jc of a SNS junction follows a quadratic temperature dependence. On the\nother hand, a superconductor\u2013insulator\u2013 superconductor (SIS) junction shows a linear\ndependence on T. Figure 4 (b) shows the JcBGB(T) from Tc down to 4 K for BGB\njunctions with high \uf071GB = 16o\u201345o. All of the JcBGB(T) curves of the BaFe2As2:Co BGB\njunctions\n\nshow\n\na\n\nquadratic\n\ntemperature\n\ndependence\n\nas\n\ndescribed\n\nby\n\n2\n\n\uf0e6\nT\uf0f6\n\uf06bd\n, which is the de Gennes' theory based on a conventional\nI c \uf03d I 0 \uf0e7\uf0e71 \uf02d \uf0f7\uf0f7\n\uf0e8 Tc \uf0f8 sinh(\uf06bd )\nproximity effect in the dirty limit33. This relation is indicated by the orange lines in the\nfigure, where d is the barrier thickness and \uf06b\u20131 is the decay length for normal metal. In\nparticular, the BGB junctions with \uf071GB = 30o and 45o have this quadratic relationship\n11\n\n\fT. Katase et al.\n\n\uf0e6 T\nwith temperature, which is more clearly confirmed in the Jc \u2013 \uf0e7\uf0e71 \uf02d\n\uf0e8 Tc\n\n\uf0f6\n\uf0f7\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\n2\n\nplots in the\n\ninset figure. For the BGB junctions with \uf071GB = 16o and 24o, JcBGB(T) deviates downward\nfrom the quadratic dependence and assumes a linear relation at temperatures lower than\n10 K and 8 K, respectively. This result can be explained by the long junction limit with\nw/\uf06cJ > 4 because the critical currents become so large that the Josephson penetration\ndepth \uf06cJ becomes smaller than the junction width w. The dependencies of the JcBGB(T)\ncurves of the BaFe2As2:Co BGB junctions are distinctly different from those reported\nfor the YBCO BGB junctions because the latter closely follow the linear relation\n\uf0e6\n\n\uf061 \uf0e7\uf0e71 \uf02d\n\uf0e8\n\nT\nTc\n\n\uf0f6\n\uf0f7\uf0f7 over a wide temperature range below Tc34.\n\uf0f8\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe doubly-larger \uf071c and the much gentler slope decay than those of YBCO BGB\njunctions make it easier to produce high Jc BaFe2As2:Co superconducting tapes because\nthe formation of a buffer layer with \uf044\uf066 \uf0a3 9o is much easier than those used for the\ncuprates, which require much smaller \uf044\uf066 of < 5o, but such buffer layers have been\nachieved only by a few groups using an additional MgO or CeO2 buffer layers35,36.\nTherefore, the large \uf071c allows us to use a simpler and lower-cost production process of\nsuperconducting tapes, and the iron pnictide superconducting tapes would find practical\napplications under a higher magnetic field if further improvement in Jc will be achieved.\nThe powder-in-tube technique has been rather progressing as an alternative\ntechnology for superconducting wires also in iron pnictides37; however, their Jc values\nstill remains at ~104 A/cm2\n\n38\n\ndue probably to existence of large angle GBs with \uf071GB\n12\n\n\fT. Katase et al.\n\nmuch greater than \uf071c = 9o. The grain boundary issue in iron pnicides will be largely\nrelaxed by the present finding. Actually, we recently succeeded in obtaining high\ntransport Jc = 3.5 MA/cm2 with a BaFe2As2:Co biaxially textured thin film on a\npolycrystalline Hastelloy tape with an IBAD-MgO textured buffer layer25.\nIn conclusion, we fabricated high-quality BaFe2As2:Co films with large JcGrain on\nbicrystal substrates with the entire range of \uf071GB = 3\u201345o and comprehensively examined\nthe grain boundary nature of the iron pnictide. The primary point clarified by the present\nstudy is that the BaFe2As2:Co BGB junctions exhibit a large \uf071c of ~9o. The low-angle\nBGBs with \uf071GB \uf0a3 9o consist of long-period dislocation cores and, therefore, JcBGB is\nsimilar to JcGrain; while the high-angle BGBs show a weak-link behavior with a gradual\ndecay of JcBGB(\uf071GB) expressed by the exponential equation of 2.8\u00d7106exp(\u2013\uf071GB/9.0o).\nSuch grain boundary natures together with the high Bc2(0) make the iron pnictides to be\nmore promising materials for application to high Jc superconducting tapes.\n\n13\n\n\fT. Katase et al.\n\nMethods\nFabrication of BaFe2As2:Co epitaxial films on bicrystal substrates. BaFe2As2:Co\n\nepitaxial films were fabricated by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) on [001]-tilt bicrystal\nsubstrates of MgO with \uf071GB = 3o\u201345o and also of LSAT with \uf071GB = 5o\u201345o. A Nd:YAG\nlaser (wavelength: 532 nm, INDI-40, Spectra-Physics) typically used for epitaxial\ngrowth of iron pnictide films13,39 with a repetition rate of 10 Hz on the PLD target of a\nhigh-purity BaFe1.84Co0.16As2 polycrystalline disk was used as the excitation source16.\nFilms with 250\u2013350 nm in thickness were grown at a temperature of 850 \uf0b0C and the\nthickness of each film was measured precisely with a surface profiler. The base pressure\nin our PLD chamber was \uf0a3 1\uf0b410\u20136 Pa, and film deposition was carried out in a vacuum\nat approximately 10\u20135 Pa. The BaFe2As2:Co epitaxial films grown under these\nconditions showed high Jc values of 1\u20134 MA/cm2 at 4 K, which were confirmed by I\u2013V\ncharacteristic measurements with a 1-\uf06dV/cm criterion17.\nTransport properties through BGB. The BaFe2As2:Co films were patterned using\n\nphotolithography and Ar-ion milling into 300 \uf06dm-long and 8 \uf06dm-wide micro-bridge\nstructures (Fig. 1(a)) to perform four-terminal I\u2013V measurements of the JcBGB across the\nBGB and of the JcGrain not across the BGB and under magnetic fields perpendicular to\nthe film surface. The critical current (Ic) and the asymptotic junction resistance (RNA)\nwere estimated from the I\u2013V characteristics28.\nMicrostructure and chemical composition analysis of BGB. The microstructures\n\naround the BGBs were examined by plan-view high-resolution transmission electron\nmicroscopy (HR-TEM). The TEM samples were prepared by a focused-ion-beam (FIB)\nmicro-sampling technique in which the area near the BGBs was mechanically cutout,\nand that area was only thinned by FIB technique. All of the operations were performed\n14\n\n\fT. Katase et al.\n\nin a high-vacuum chamber. The chemical composition of the bulk film and the BGBs\nwas analyzed by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) with a spatial resolution\nof approximately 1 nm.\n\n15\n\n\fT.

Each horizontal bar indicates 5 nm scale.\n\nFigure 4 | Magnetic field and temperature dependence of JcBGB for the\nBaFe2As2:Co BGB junctions. (a) JcBGB(B) curves of BaFe2As2:Co BGB junctions with\n\n\uf071GB = 3o\u201345o grown on MgO bicrystal substrates measured at 4 K. The intragrain Jc\n(JcGrain) values measured in the Grain bridge on a 3o MgO bicrystal substrate are also\nplotted by closed symbols. The inset shows a magnified plot in the low magnetic field\nup to 0.2 T. (b) JcBGB(T) for the BGB junctions with high \uf071GB = 16o\u201345o grown on MgO\nbicrystal substrates measured from Tc down to 4 K. The orange lines show the variation\nof Jc with temperature as predicted from de Gennes' theory33. The inset shows a\nlinearized plot of the quadratic temperature dependence for \uf071GB = 30o and 45o.\n\n22\n\n\fa\n\nb\n\nc\n\nFigure 1\n\n\fa\nRNA :\n5x10-11 \uf057cm2\n\nb\n\nc\n\nFigure 2\n\nRNA :\n5x10-10 \uf057cm2\n\n\fa\nBGB\n\nb\nBGB\n\nc\nBGB\n\nFigure 3\n\n\fa\n\nB (T)\n\nB (T)\n\nb\n\nFigure 4\n\n\f"}
