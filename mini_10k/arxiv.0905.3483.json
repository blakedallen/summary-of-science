The secondary star fills its Roche lobe, losing material to the primary by the inner Lagrangian point, L1 . Polars, also called AM Her systems after\ntheir prototype, are CVs in which the magnetic field reaches the 10 to 200 MG range in the primary surface. Such a strong field significantly\naffects the dynamics of the mass transfer preventing the formation of the accretion disc, a typical feature of non-magnetic CVs. In polars,\nthe material from L1 follows a ballistic trajectory on the orbital plane (horizontal stream) up to the magnetic coupling region, which is also\ncalled the threading region. From this region onwards, the gas-flow effectively traces the geometry of the magnetic field, forming an accretion stream which reaches the white dwarf (WD) with supersonic velocity and ionised. Another consequence of the strong magnetic field is\nthe synchronization of the white-dwarf rotation with the orbital revolution. Reviews on polars can be found in Cropper (1990) and Warner\n(1995).\nNear the white dwarf, the magnetically controlled flow creates a shocked region that emits most of the system flux in optical and X-ray\nwavelengths. It is usually called the post-shock region. Its location on the white-dwarf surface depends on the geometric properties of the\nmagnetic field and the threading region distance. Considering a dipolar magnetic field, the base of the accretion stream could not be at the\nmagnetic pole since the threading region would be too far. Specifically, given a magnetic field geometry, the distance from the threading\nregion to the white dwarf defines the angle between the magnetic pole and the post-shock region (Cropper 1989).\nThe optical flux and polarisation of polars are highly modulated with the orbital phase. These observations can be explained by the\ncooling of the post-shock region through cyclotron process. This emission depends strongly on the viewing angle and the physical properties\n\n\u22c6\n\nE-mail: jercosta@das.inpe.br\n\n\f2\n\nCosta & Rodrigues\n\nof the emitting region. Stokes techniques are consequently a powerful tool to diagnose the physical and geometrical properties of the accreting\nregion.\nAn important first step in the modelling of polar observations was given in '80s by different groups (Chanmugam & Dulk 1981;\nMeggitt & Wickramasinghe 1982; Wickramasinghe & Meggitt 1985). These works assumed the emitting region as a point source with fixed\nvalues of magnetic field induction, electronic temperature, and size parameter, \u039b - this last parameter carries information about the electronic\ndensity and the optical depth of the emitting region. Wickramasinghe & Meggitt (1985) present a grid of fluxes, and linear and circular polarisations as function of viewing angle and harmonic for some models with different values of \u039b and electronic temperature, which can be used\nto fit optical data of AM Her systems. However, there are many pieces of observational evidence of an extended emitting region in polars. A\nnatural improvement therefore is a two-dimensional modelling using a sum of point sources with distinct parameters to represent the emitting\nregion (e.g., Ferrario & Wickramasinghe 1990; Potter, Hakala & Cropper 1998). This approach is based on an optically thin hypothesis in\nwhich the overlap of the emitting points do not produce moderate opacities. The density and temperature can also vary in the radial direction\nas a consequence of the shock. This was introduced in the models by Wickramasinghe & Ferrario (1988), Wu & Wickramasinghe (1990),\nand Potter et al. (2004). Calculations on the shock structure of magnetically-channelled accretion flows can be found in Cropper et al. (1999)\nand Canalle et al. (2005).\nIn this work, we present a code to simulate the continuum optical emission from polars. We call it CYCLOPS, an acronym for CYCLOtron emission of PolarS. It incorporates the radiative transfer of the cyclotronic process in the post-shock region adopting a threedimensional treatment and specific functions to describe the variation of physical quantities. For the first time, the radiative transfer is solved\nin a stepwise manner considering in each step the homogeneous solution of the transfer equation with non-null input radiation. The shape\nof the emitting region is defined by following the magnetic field lines from the threading region to the white-dwarf surface. A procedure to\nfit observational data is also included. In Sec. 2, we describe the model. Some examples of results and comparisons with previous works are\nshown in Sec. 3. An application to V834 Centauri's data is presented in Sec. 4. The last section presents a summary of this work.\n\n2 A NEW MODEL TO THE EMISSION FROM POLARS\nOur objective is to model the cyclotronic emission from the post-shock region in the accreting columns of polars. It is considered as an\nextended three-dimensional (3D) region composed by thermal electrons immersed in a dipolar magnetic field. The code considers electron\ntemperature and density profiles in the radial and tangential direction of the emitting region, i.e., they are not constant inside the emitting\nregion. In this section, we describe our model as well as some details of its implementation, which has been done using as framework the\nInteractive Data Language (IDL).\n2.1 Defining the emitting region\nIn this section, we present an overview of the adopted scenario to model the optical emission coming from polars, which is schematically\nrepresented in Figure 1. The geometry of the emitting region is defined considering a poloidal magnetic field that captures the material from\nthe ballistic trajectory. This coupling region is called the threading region. Our model assumes that it is a 2D surface on the equatorial plane\nof the binary system. Below we enumerate the main definitions and assumptions of our model.\nC OORDINATE SYSTEM . The system as a whole is defined by a spherical coordinate system centred in the white dwarf (WD) being the\npolar axis parallel to the rotation axis of the white dwarf (this is also the direction perpendicular to the orbital plane). A reference point\ninside the emitting region defines the longitude zero. We call it the anchor point, which is represented as a black dot in Figure 1 (right). The\ncolatitude of the anchor point is \u03b2.\nI NCLINATION . The system can be seen by any inclination, which is defined by the angle between the WD rotation axis and the observer.\nW HITE DWARF. The primary is described by an opaque sphere of arbitrary radius, RW D . The eclipse of the emitting region by the WD\nis consequently included. From the definition of the coordinate system, the WD angular momentum has the same direction and sense of the\npolar axis. The default sense rotation of the WD occurs in the counter-clockwise sense as seen by an observer at a positive latitude.\nM AGNETIC FIELD . The direction and intensity of the magnetic field in the emitting region follow the prescription of a centred dipolar\nfield. The magnetic axis can have any angle (colatitude) to the rotation axis. Also its longitude is free. Thus, the rotation axis, magnetic axis,\nand accreting region are not necessarily in a same plane: this allows the magnetic field lines to depart considerably from the radial direction.\nG EOMETRY OF THE EMITTING REGION . Its shape is of a magnetic tube whose inferior and superior ends are sections of spherical surfaces\nwith radius [bRW D ] and [(b + h)RW D ], respectively. This means that a region with b = 1 and h = 0.1 runs from the WD surface to 10%\nRW D in height. The borders are defined by the magnetic field lines that delineate the threading region in the equatorial plane of the binary\nsystem as shown in Figure 1. This procedure provides a better approach than an ad-hoc choice and a tool to, in future works, understand\nthe threading region in polars, i.e., the region where the matter coming from the secondary is coupled to the magnetic field lines. This also\nprevents the choice of an emitting region resulting from an unlikely threading region. In order to calculate the \"walls\" of the emitting region,\nwe first follow the magnetic field line that passes through the anchor point up to the crossing with the equatorial plane of the binary system.\nThis defines a point so forth called the threading point at a radius of Rth and a longitude of longth : it is represented as an asterisk in Figure\n1 (left). Then we consider a 2D threading region extending from (1 \u2212 \u2206R ) Rth to (1 + \u2206R ) Rth in radius and 2\u2206long in longitude. The\n\n\fStokes imaging of AM Her systems\n\n3\n\nmagnetic field lines that define this boundary are followed back to the WD surface, and so define the border of the emitting region. An\nexample of the emitting region on the white dwarf is presented in Figure 1 (right). In this procedure, Rth and longth are determined by\n\u03b2, the colatitude of the anchor point, and the magnetic field axis latitude and longitude. The extension of the threading region accounts for\nthe dispersion in velocities and angular momentum of the accreting matter. We would like to note that the threading point is not necessarily\nat the centre of threading region, which extends from [longth \u2212 2fl \u2206long ] to [longth + 2(1 \u2212 fl )\u2206long ] in longitude. In this manner, the\nthreading point location is controlled by the parameter fl and can be at any longitude between its least and maximum values. This brings\nabout an anchor point that can be off centre too.\nE LECTRONIC DENSITY AND TEMPERATURE . Our code allows us to adopt any analytical function to represent the matter density and\ntemperature in the emitting region. In this work, we have considered the following options for their variation. In the tangential direction, no\nvariation at all or an exponential decrease from the anchor point to the border of the region. As the anchor point is not necessarily centred, as\nexplained above, the point of highest density/temperature can be displaced from the geometrical centre of the region. In the radial direction,\nthe density decreases exponentially and the temperature increases exponentially from the WD surface to above. The used functions try to\nsimulate the temperature and density shock solutions as shown in Figure 1 from Cropper et al. (1999) including cyclotron cooling. However,\nthey can be scaled in value and in height.\nP HASE . The zero phase corresponds to the anchor point in the meridian of zero longitude. Therefore, in this phase the anchor point is\nlocated in the plane containing the white-dwarf rotation axis and the observer direction.\n\n2.2 The radiative transfer\nIn the previous section, we have described the main assumptions of our code relative to description of the emitting region. Now we turn to\nthe details of the radiative transfer solution for the cyclotron emission.\nThe radiative transfer is solved in a discrete approach as explained here. We initially define a Cartesian coordinate system in which the\nz axis is the observer direction, i.e., the direction of the radiation propagation. The x axis is in the orbital plane, and the y-axis completes\nthe coordinate system. It is called the observer reference frame. A cube containing the emitting region is then defined and divided in N3\nvoxels (elements of volume). In this representation, the emitting region is composed by (a maximum of) N2 lines of sight. In each of them,\nthe radiative transfer is solved in steps of homogeneous voxels. Specifically, the density, temperature, and magnetic field are allowed to vary\nfrom voxel to voxel, but are constant inside a voxel. The values assumed for the calculations are that of the central point of the voxel. The\nnumber of voxels, defining the resolution of the grid, are freely chosen to properly account for the variation of the parameters and geometry\nof the region. The Stokes parameters that represent the integrated emission from the region are the sum of Stokes parameters of all line of\nsights. The voxel structure is redone for each phase in which we run the code.\nThe solution of the transfer of polarised radiation in magneto-active plasma is found in Pacholczyk & Swihart (1975, eqs. 7 to 13) or\nZheleznyakov, Suvorov & Shaposhnikov (1974). It considers a non-null incident radiation and therefore should be used here, because from\nthe second voxel and forth the emission from the preceding voxel should be considered as input. This gives us confidence that we have\nan adequate treatment to any optical depth, even those intermediate from the optically thin to thick regimes. In Appendix A, we present\nan alternative expression to the solution of Pacholczyk & Swihart (1975) and some misprints in the original formulae. In order to avoid\ncomputational problems in voxels with optical depth much smaller than 1, the formalism of Pacholczyk & Swihart (1975) for negligible\nabsorption was used (their eq. 14).\nThe Pacholczyk & Swihart (1975)'s solutions are defined in a coordinate system having one axis parallel to the component of the\nmagnetic field perpendicular to the radiation propagation direction. We call it the plasma reference system. The magnetic field direction\nchanges from voxel to voxel and thus the plasma reference system. Consequently this system is not appropriated to represent the emergent\nemission from the region as whole - see discussion presented in Pacholczyk & Swihart (1967). The incident and emergent Stokes' vectors of\neach voxel are therefore represented in the coordinate system of the observer defined above. As a consequence, to solve the radiative transfer,\nthese vectors have to be transformed to and from the plasma reference system in each voxel.\nThe cyclotronic emission coefficients have been calculated using the expressions from Beard & Baker (1962) and Chanmugam (1980).\nOur results agree very well with Figure 1 from Chanmugam (1980). The absorption coefficients have been obtained from the Kirchhoff's Law, considering the thermal regime, as proposed by Meggitt & Wickramasinghe (1982). The particular solution of the radiative\ntransfer equation (Pacholczyk & Swihart 1975) in this case equals to the Planck function (see Equation A4). Following the procedure of\nWickramasinghe & Meggitt (1985), the bremsstrahlung absorption has also been considered. The Faraday mixing coefficients can be found\nin Meggitt & Wickramasinghe (1982) or Pacholczyk (1977). In this work, we have not included any scattering process in the radiative\nsolution.\nThe computation is done considering a fixed frequency. Consequently, the harmonic number of the cyclotron emission varies throughout\nthe region, because the magnetic field changes in space due to the dipolar geometry. When fitting observational data, it must be taken into\naccount the width of the observing bandpass. We will return to this topic in Section 4.\nIn order to test the algorithm of integration by steps of the radiative transfer, we constructed regions with homogeneous physical properties (magnetic field intensity and direction, electronic density, and temperature). The resulting spectra of the stepwise solution, for different\nchoices of parameters, was confronted to the one-step solution provided in Meggitt & Wickramasinghe (1982) and Wickramasinghe & Meggitt\n(1985). The two solutions are in very good agreement.\n\n\f4\n\nCosta & Rodrigues\n\n2.3 Extinction by the upper portion of the accreting column\nThe magnetically controlled flow in polars begins at the threading region and ends at the WD surface. Our current view of polars assumes\nthat only a portion with enhanced density near the WD, the post-shock region, emits by the cyclotronic process. There is, however, material\nin the flow outside the emitting region that could, in principle, attenuate this emission, if it is in between the observer and the post-shock\nregion. This portion of the accretion column will be called the attenuation region. We have, then, included in our code the calculation of this\nregion for which an extinction can be assumed. The attenuation region is divided in voxels and limited by the same magnetic field lines that\ndelineate the emitting region, thus a given line of sight (from the N 2 ones that represent the emitting region) has above a specific number\nof voxels to which some attenuation can be assigned. All the voxels have the same value of attenuation, hence each line of sight has a total\nattenuation proportional to the number of voxels above it. The inclusion of this attenuation is optional in our code. If the user decides to use\nit, the program chooses the best value that fits the observed data (see next section). Each voxel has a maximum attenuation limited by the\nThomson scattering cross section and the minimum density in the emitting region, which is achieved in its superior border.\n2.4 Fitting observational data\nUnderstanding the optical emission of AM Her systems can be divided in two main tasks: (1) to propose a model to the system and to calculate\nits emission; (2) to decide, among the many possible sets of model parameters, the one that best fits the observations. This section concerns\nthe procedure to fit the data. Our code aims to reproduce the total, linear and circular polarised fluxes, and the angle of the linear polarisation\nas function of the orbital phase. Our code produces images of the four Stokes parameters (see Section 3). However, the observational data\nhave not enough angular resolution to see the post-shock regions as extended objects. So the code integrates the images in one speficic phase\nproviding a point per Stokes parameter.\nA model is described by a set of parameters which are explained in detail in Section 2.1. The CYCLOPS parameters are presented as a\nquick list below.\n\u2022 i, inclination;\n\u2022 \u03b2, the colatitude of the emitting region;\n\u2022 b, the distance from the WD centre to the base of the region in units if WD radius. In spite of be a free parameter in the code, we assume\nit equal to one in all calculations presented in this work;\n\u2022 h, the length of the emitting region in the WD radial direction;\n\u2022 \u2206R, one-half of the fractional radial extension of the threading region;\n\u2022 \u2206long, one-half of the azimuth extension of the threading region;\n\u2022 fl , this parameter controls the position in the longitudinal direction of the threading point relative to the geometrical centre of the\nthreading region. If the value of fl is 0 (0.5; 1.0), the threading point is at the border of smallest longitude (centre; border of largest\nlongitude) of the threading region. We would like to recall that this parameter controls the point of maximum density and/or temperature in\nthe emitting region;\n\u2022 B, the magnetic field intensity in the magnetic pole on the white-dwarf surface from which we calculate the magnetic moment of the\ndipole;\n\u2022 Blat , the latitude of the magnetic axis;\n\u2022 Blong , the longitude of the magnetic axis;\n\u2022 Ne , the maximum value of the electronic density;\n\u2022 T , the maximum value of the electronic temperature.\nThe user must specify the frequency(ies) in which the data have been collected and is(are) not a free parameter.\nThere are parameters that are not part of the physical description of the system, but should be specified in the calculation. They are the\nnumber of orbital phases and the number of voxels in one dimension in the cube inscribing the emitting region (see Section 2.1).\nWhen fitting an observational data set, there are five quantities that are calculated for each model. We discuss each one in the following\nparagraphs.\nSCALE FACTOR TO THE CYCLOTRON FLUX . The code firstly calculates the scale factor that multiplies the circular polarised flux of the\nmodel in order to provide the best match with the observed data. This flux component can only be explained by cyclotron emission and is,\ntherefore, the best choice to fix the scale factor of the model. The same factor is then applied to the total and the linear polarised flux of the\ncyclotron model.\nTHE CONTRIBUTION OF AN ADDITIONAL UNPOLARISED SOURCE OF LIGHT. After fixing the scale of the model flux using the circular\npolarisation data, the code calculates the flux of an unpolarised and constant source of light that should be added to the total flux of the model\nto best fit the observed flux. The addition of such a source of light is usually necessary when fitting data and can be easily justified by the\ncontribution of other components of the system, as the white dwarf, for instance.\nAN OFFSET IN PHASE . The code also calculates the offset between the observed and model phases that best reproduces the data.\nAN OFFSET IN POLARISATION ANGLE . When fitting the linear polarization, we included an offset in polarisation angle to obtain the best\nagreement between model and data.\n\n\fStokes imaging of AM Her systems\n\n5\n\nTHE MAXIMUM EXTINCTION IN THE ATTENUATION REGION . As explained in Section 2.3, our code can include the extinction caused by\nthe upper portion of accreting column in front of the emission from the post-shock region. If this option is set, the attenuation is fitted with\nthe constraint of the maximum value it can assume for Thomson scattering in the attenuation region.\n\nTo search for the post-shock region properties in the domains of such a large number of input parameters, we have adopted a two-step\napproach. Initially, we use the pikaia implementation of a genetic algorithm by Charbonneau (1995)1 to look for the region in the parameter\nspace associated with the maximum of a figure of merit related to the goodness of the fitting (g.o.f.). We then use an amoeba code (Press et al.\n1992) to refine the search for the best model. The g.o.f. is measured by the \u03c72 or a modified expressions similar to it. We have implemented\nto weight or not each parcel of the \u03c72 with the observational error. The g.o.f. of a model is the sum of the \u03c72 for each observed curve: the\ntotal flux, the linear polarised flux, the circular polarised flux, and the position angle of the linear polarisation. For two or more bandpass\ndata, the g.o.f. is obtained by the sum of the \u03c72 for each band.\n\n3 GENERAL RESULTS\nAn important aspect of the emission from polars is the high variability with phase. The reason is two-fold. Firstly, the cyclotron radiative\ncoefficient is strongly dependent on the viewing angle of the magnetic field. Second, the physical depth of the emitting region changes with\nphase in a region not spherically symmetric. A specific phase has, therefore, a total emission different from another phase as a result from\nmatter distribution and view angle of the magnetic field. Both aspects of the cyclotron emission in polars is properly treated by our model. In\nthis section, we show some results that illustrate the above discussion.\nCYCLOPS has as parameters the values of electronic density and temperature. Previous models tend to use the size parameter, \u039b. Its\ndefinition is (e.g., Meggitt & Wickramasinghe 1982):\n\n\u039b = 2.01 105\n\n\u0010\n\ns\n105 cm\n\n\u0011\u0010\n\nNe\n1016 cm\u22123\n\n\u0011\u0012\n\n3 107 G\nB\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\nAs we are using a 3D treatment, a value of \u039b does not specify a unique model: we have a family of models with different values of electronic\ndensity and height of the emitting region, h, that can produce a same value of \u039b, supposing the magnetic field as fixed.\nWe would like to start the presentation of our results with their validation in comparison with those of Ferrario & Wickramasinghe\n(1990), who presented 2D extended models of polars. Figure 2 (left) presents our model calculated with the parameters equivalent to the\nFigs. 2-5(c) from Ferrario & Wickramasinghe (1990). We have adopted constant values of electronic density and temperature without the\naddition of a component of constant and unpolarised flux. The curves represent the results for two values of h, 0.03 and 0.10 (Ne equals to\n5.13 1013 and 1.55 1013 cm\u22123 , respectively). These numbers provide the same \u039b of the models of Ferrario & Wickramasinghe (1990) for a\nradial line of sight passing in the centre of the emitting region. We have adopted a frequency of 6.6 1014 Hz (optical wavelengths) in order\nto have the harmonic number near 8. Our curves are almost identical those from Ferrario & Wickramasinghe (1990). The small difference\nare acceptable, giving the different methodologies. The maximum optical depth (considering all the phases and all the line of sights) occurs\naround phase 0.5 and is 0.73 (0.23) for the model using h = 0.03 (0.10) and is exactly where our two models present distinct values (Figure\n2, right). That shows that the differences quickly appear as the opacity enlarges, as expected, and the optical depth depends on phase.\nOn the other hand, the differences between our approach and 2D calculations is illustrated in Figure 3. It presents the results for the\nsame set of parameters used in Figure 2, but for a frequency 2.0 1014 Hz, in the near-infrared. The model samples lower harmonics and hence\noptically thicker region. Figure 3 shows how diverse can be the curves for different values of h in this regime of optical depths. Therefore\na set of parameters (as those used in Figure 2) can produce similar curves in optical wavelengths, but not in the infrared. We then consider\nthat a 3D approach is more appropriate to model the physical and geometrical properties of the post-shock regions of a polar, particularly\nfor mildly optically thick emission. This situation is found in low harmonic numbers or in regions with high densities (Ne > 1015 cm\u22123 ).\nFigure 4 shows the Stokes imaging of the previous models (h = 0.03) in optical and near-infrared frequencies. It illustrates how the total flux\nand polarisation vary along the emitting region. For instance, at phase 0 (0/12) of the lower harmonic, the brighter region (optically thicker)\nis less polarized than the darker region.\nAs shock profiles are denser near the white-dwarf surface, it is interesting to check if the above result is also valid for a radially\nvariable density and temperature. Figure 5 shows our results for flux and circular polarization in optical and near-infrared wavelengths for\nmodels having (1) constant or (2) exponentially decreasing (increasing) densities (temperatures). There are differences in the curves which\nare striking in the near-infrared. It is noticeable the raise of the asymmetry in the flux which allow to distinguish the \"shock\" model from\na shorter region (compare Figures 5 and 3). Also the circular polarization is much larger than when the matter is concentrated near the\nwhite-dwarf surface.\n\n1\n\nhttp://www.hao.ucar.edu/Public/models/pikaia/pikaia.html\n\n\f6\n\nCosta & Rodrigues\n\nTable 1.

This aims to illustrate the potential of our tool and also to trace the path to future improvements.\nV834 Centauri is an object already recognized as having extended emitting regions (e.g., Cropper 1989; Potter et al. 2004). The reader\nis referred to these works (and references therein) to a description of the system. From the many published Stokes curves of V834 Cen,\nwe have chosen those presented in Bailey et al. (1983). They represent the magnitudes and circular polarization of V834 Cen in optical and\nnear-infrared bands and are ideal to test our fitting procedure using two data set in different harmonic regions. Specifically, we have used the\nV and J band curves converted to flux and polarized flux. We have used frequencies corresponding to the central wavelength of the bands.\nWe could not find a good simultaneous fit to both bands using constant values of density and temperature in tangential direction. So we\nadopted a lateral variation as explained in Section 2.1. Figure 6 presents the model with the better value of \u03c72 . It was found from a search\nwith no restriction in the parameter space. It produces a huge number of possibilities, but we think it is a better approach for testing the search\nalgorithm. The parameter of this model is presented in Table 1. The gross features are reproduced, including the relative fluxes between the\nbands. We suggest that a different matter distribution in the emitting region may produce a finer agreement with the data. The above model\nalso reproduces the H data of V834 Cen (Bailey et al. 1983), even if not included in the fit procedure (Figure 7).\nThe parameters relative to the geometry of V834 Cen are consistent with previous fittings of the system. For instance, the previous\ninclinations found in the literature are in the range 40 \u2013 60 \u25e6 (Cropper 1989; Schwope et al. 1993; Ferrario & Wickramasinghe 1990). Extended emitting region was previous found (Cropper 1989; Ferrario & Wickramasinghe 1990; Potter et al. 2004). This is naturally explained\nby an extended threading region. Previous estimates to its radius can be found in Mauche (2002, from 5.9 to 37.5 RW D ), using ultraviolet\nphotometry and spectroscopy, and in Cropper (1989), who also found values of order of 30 RW D using polarimetric data. We can find a\nnumber of estimates to the temperature using high-energy data: they concentrate in the range 10 - 20 keV (Barlow et al. 2006, e.g.). Our\naverage temperature is also consistent to those values. The magnetic field estimate from Zeeman line splitting in white dwarf photosphere is\n23 MG Ferrario et al. (1992).\nThe number of possible models, even for narrow bands of all free parameters, is huge. Thus, the search for the best model is limited by\nthe available time and processing power. The genetic algorithm has proven to be a robust and efficient method. Even so, a very large database\nof models was generated. It is hard to quantify how much has been explored from the universe of possibilities, but the solution we found is\nan improvement in the sense it simultaneously explain three wavebands.\n\n5 CONCLUSIONS\nWe present a new code, CYCLOPS, to study the optical emission from AM Herculis systems. It calculates the cyclotron emission from a\n3D region on or near the white-dwarf surface. The emitting region is presented by a 3D grid with physical properties spatially variable but\nphysically connected by a function. The adopted solution by steps for the radiative transfer is adequate to represent optically thick columns.\nThe code also incorporates a procedure to fit an observational data set. An application to previous published multiband V834 Cen data is\nshown. A model with an extended region with electronic temperature and density varying with height and in the tangential direction is able\nto account for the data.\n\n\fStokes imaging of AM Her systems\n\n7\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe acknowledge the referees by their suggestions which were valuable in improving the final version of the manuscript.
