By including dynamical scattering in both the elastic and inelastic\nchannels we obtain quantitative agreement between theory and experiment. Our results enable a\nclose scrutiny of the inelastic scattering physics and demonstrate the possibility of element-specific\natom counting.\nPACS numbers:\n\nThe short de Broglie wavelength of high-energy electrons enables a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) to form an electron beam of sub-atomic\ndimensions. Such beams can be used to probe the atomic\nand electronic structure of materials with extremely high\nselectivity. Collection of the inelastic scattering resulting\nfrom the excitation of atomic core electrons, via electron\nenergy-loss spectroscopy (EELS), provides both chemical and electronic bonding information. Recently it\nhas become possible to utilize the core-loss EELS signal in a STEM to map the chemical composition and\nelectronic structure of materials at the atomic scale [1\u2013\n6]. This capacity constitutes an extremely powerful tool\nin materials characterization. In the present work, we\nconsider whether it is possible to perform quantitative\nchemical mapping at the atomic scale. Such a capability\nwould permit, for example, element-specific column-bycolumn atom counting, with significant implications for\nthe materials and condensed matter communities. To\nthis end, it is crucial to establish a sufficiently accurate\ninterpretation of the contrast in atomic-resolution chemical maps, and, in particular, to determine whether the\ndominant inelastic scattering is treated correctly in current theories based on a single-particle description of the\ncore-excitation process. Here we report the first atomicresolution chemical mapping with the EELS signal acquired on an absolute scale (i.e. normalized with respect\nto the incident beam). We demonstrate that quantification within a single-particle picture is indeed possible\nunder favorable circumstances. In other cases, we find\ndiscrepancies between the simulations and experiments\nindicative of a break-down of the single-particle model.\nIn a STEM, images are generated by scanning a convergent electron beam across an electron-transparent specimen in a raster-like fashion, while collecting various scattered signals in synchronization with the scanning beam.\nA common mode of atomic-resolution imaging in the\nSTEM is annular dark-field (ADF) imaging, whereby the\n\nelectrons elastically scattered to high angles are collected\nby an annular-shaped detector. While atomic-resolution\nADF imaging of crystals can now be achieved routinely,\nquantification of the image contrast has a long and controversial history [7, 8]. Discrepancies between experimental and simulated contrast levels, referred to as the\n\"Stobbs factor\", were often found to be as large as 3\u2013\n5 times, and led to speculation that fundamental scattering mechanisms were missing from the simulations.\nWith improved quantification techniques, however, recent work [9] has persuasively argued that discrepancies\nin ADF image contrast can be accommodated by including a physically-reasonable source size in the simulations.\nA major conclusion of that work is that multislice calculations [10] incorporating a frozen-phonon model of thermal diffuse scattering [11] correctly describe the dominant scattering mechanisms in ADF imaging.\nOn the other hand, core-loss EELS offers a wealth of\ninformation not accessible by ADF imaging, including\nunique identification of the chemical elements and bonding information. However, the inelastic scattering processes relevant to core-loss EELS add a level of complexity over and above that of ADF imaging. In this study, we\nhave performed carefully calibrated experiments, allowing atomic-resolution chemical signals to be extracted on\nan absolute scale. By simultaneously recording the elastic signal, also on an absolute scale, and using it to characterize the electron beam and sample thickness, we eliminate all free parameters in the acquisition of the core-loss\nsignals. Coupled with simulations that incorporate both\ncore-loss inelastic scattering and dynamical elastic scattering, the present work enables a close scrutiny of the\nscattering physics in this inelastic channel.\nExperiments were performed using an aberrationcorrected Nion UltraSTEM operating at 100 kV with a\nbeam convergence semi-angle of 31.8 \u00b1 0.1 mrad. The\nspecimen consisted of a DyScO3 single crystal in the\n[101] crystallographic orientation. The EELS signal was\n\n\f2\nrecorded using a Gatan Enfina spectrometer with a collection semi-angle of 79.8 \u00b1 0.1 mrad. During all experiments, ADF images were recorded simultaneously\nwith the energy-loss spectra. The inner and outer ADF\ncollection semi-angles were 98.2 \u00b1 0.2 and 294.5 \u00b1 0.5\nmrad, respectively. Both the EELS and ADF signals\nwere recorded so as to allow their calibration in terms of\nthe fractional beam intensity. Data was obtained for a\nlarge range of specimen thicknesses. This permits a direct\ncomparison with theoretical predictions of absolute cross\nsections and chemical maps from the Dy-M4,5 (3d \u2192 4f ),\nDy-N4,5 (4d \u2192 4f and continuum), and Sc-L2,3 (2p \u2192 3d\nand continuum) edges. The different symmetries of the\nDy and Sc sublattices, and the presence of two different\nDy edges, allow us to identify and separate elastic and\ninelastic effects.\nAs a first step, we performed quantification of the ADF\nimages. Not only does this provide a check on various\nexperimental parameters, it also enables us to determine\nthe effective source size of the instrument independently\nfrom the EELS measurements. Since source size effects\nare manifest in the same way in both ADF and EELS\n[12], this step is crucial for the quantitative analysis of the\ncore-loss signal. ADF quantification is shown in Fig. 1.\nThe inset of Fig. 1(a) shows an ADF image of one unit\ncell of [101] DyScO3 . The ADF image consists of bright\nspots at the positions of Dy atomic columns and weaker\nspots at the positions of Sc atomic columns (O atoms are\nnot discernible). The graph in Fig. 1(a) compares the\nexperimental position-averaged, or mean, ADF signal as\na function of sample thickness with the prediction from\nfrozen phonon multislice simulations. The general agreement is very good (to within about 5%). A quantitative\ncomparison of the contrast in experimental and simulated\nimages enables us to extract the effective source size of\nthe instrument.

The\neffective source distribution was modeled as a combination of Gaussian and truncated-Lorentzian distributions,\nfitted using nonlinear least-square optimization. The effective source of our instrument is described by a Gaussian with a full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 0.71\n\u00c5 convolved with a truncated Lorentizian with a FWHM\nof 0.18 \u00c5 that reflects residual aberrations in the instrument alignment.\nThe simulations used for quantitative analysis of the\ncore-loss EELS signal were based on a relativistic multipole core-loss theory [13, 14], performed on a GPU cluster [15]. The relevant scattering physics is described\nby the following expression for the wave function of an\ninelastically-scattered electron at the specimen exit surface:\nZ\n\u03c8\u03b1 (x) = d2 x00 d2 x0 G\u03b1 (x, x00 )\u03c3\u03b1 V\u03b1 (x00 )G0 (x00 , x0 )\u03c80 (x0 ).\n(1)\nIn this expression, \u03c80 is the wave function of the highenergy electron beam at the specimen entrance surface,\nV\u03b1 is a quantum-mechanical matrix element describing\nthe effect of core excitation on the high-energy electron, \u03c3\u03b1 is the interaction constant, and G0 and G\u03b1\nare the Green's functions describing the dynamical elastic scattering, or \"channeling\", of the high-energy electron before and after the core excitation event. Channeling was calculated using a frozen-phonon multislice\nmethod, while the matrix elements V\u03b1 were calculated\nwithin a single-particle model where the initial and final states of the core electron are described by atomic\nwave functions [13, 16]. Since Eq. (1) includes channeling before and after core excitation, it is referred to as\na \"double-channeling\" theory [17\u201319]. We find that although a single-channeling approximation, obtained by\nneglecting channeling after core excitation [2, 20, 21],\nproduces qualitatively similar results, double-channeling\neffects are important for quantitative agreement, especially in the presence of heavy elements such as Dy.\nFig. 2 shows a collage of experimental and simulated\nchemical maps of [101] DyScO3 for a range of specimen\nthicknesses. The majority of the maps are seen to exhibit\nlocal maxima at the sites of the corresponding atomic\ncolumns for all thicknesses in the recorded range. This is\na highly desirable feature, as it allows an intuitive interpretation of the maps in terms of the locations of atomic\nsites. These features are well-reproduced by the simulations that incorporate the effective source distribution.\nOn the other hand, simulations that do not incorporate\nthe effective source (not shown) reveal that in the Dy-M5\nand Dy-N4,5 maps local minima do, in fact, develop at\nthe Dy columns as the thickness increases beyond about\n20 nm. While similar minima have been observed previously and were attributable to coherent effects [2, 19, 22\u2013\n26], our large collection angle implies that here the min-\n\n\f3\n\nSc\n\nDy M5\n\nO\n\nDy N off-rez.\n\nDy N on-rez.\n\nSc L2,3\n\nExpt.\nOriginal\nData\n\nExpt.\nNoise\nFiltered\n\nExpt.\nPosition\nAveraged\n\nSimul.\n\n71 nm\n\n32 nm\n\n21 nm\n\nDy\n\n0.6\n\nX10-5\n\n4.7 0.18\n\nX10-3\n\n1.8 2.7\n\nX10-4\n\n5.5 0.8\n\nX10-4\n\n4.0\n\nFIG. 2: Quantitative atomic-resolution chemical mapping of [101] DyScO3 . For each chemical signal (indicated atop) and\nspecimen thickness (indicated left) we show raw, noise-filtered, unit-cell-averaged, and simulated maps. Unit-cell-averaged\nmaps are from about 25 unit cells. Intensity scales refer to the fractional beam intensity. The experimental spectra and\nenergy-loss integration windows are shown in Fig. 3(a). Simulations incorporate the overall scaling factors from Fig. 3(b).\n\nima develop as a consequence of strong elastic scattering\nby the heavy Dy column prior to core excitation, with\nthe scattering subsequent to core excitation also playing\na role. For the Dy-N4,5 maps, the form of the matrix elements is such that the minima are even more pronounced,\nto the point where the Dy-N4,5 maps in Fig. 2 can exhibit minima at the Dy columns even when the effective\nsource is included. The effect is particularly strong in the\nDy-N4,5 on-resonance map, which exhibits clear minima\nacross almost the entire range of thicknesses. Contrary\nto this behavior, the Sc-L2,3 maps exhibit no such minima because the lighter Sc columns imply weaker elastic\nscattering. Overall, the results in Fig. 2 demonstrate very\ngood agreement between the simulated and experimental\nchemical maps across the range of recorded thicknesses.\nLet us proceed to a quantitative comparison of the experimental and simulated chemical maps. The energyloss spectra and integration windows of the signals are\nshown in Fig. 3(a). For Dy-M5 and Sc-L2,3 we have\nanalyzed the near-edge signals since they are strongest,\nwhile for Dy-N4,5 we have avoided complications associated with the Fano resonance and have analyzed the\nsignal at 60 eV above threshold. We proceed by comparing the absolute cross-sections, as represented by the\nmean inelastic signals as a function of sample thickness,\nas shown in Fig. 3(b). Firstly, it is noted that for DyM5 , the simulation significantly overestimates the mean\nsignal (dashed line in Fig. 3(b)). The discrepancy is at-\n\ntributable to inelastic scattering associated with multiple plasmon excitations, which is absent from the simulations. Ideally, the effects of such scattering would\nbe removed from the experimental spectra by deconvolution. However, we find that this method is unreliable in\nthe case of atomic-resolution EELS where the low signal\nmeans that the spectra are noisy and the extended edges\nare not fully recorded. Instead, we chose to incorporate\nthe effects of multiple plasmon scattering into the simulations as a correction given by Beer's law e\u2212t/\u03bb0 , where\nt is the sample thickness and \u03bb0 is the inelastic mean-free\npath. This correction has been applied to the simulated\nDy-M5 and Sc-L2,3 signals in Fig. 3(b). After applying\nthe correction, we observe that the thickness-dependent\ntrends of the simulated mean signals agree well with the\nexperiments. Moreover, the absolute value of the Dy-M5\nmean signal is in agreement with experiment to within\nabout 5%. For the Sc-L2,3 signal, we observe that the\nsimulation overestimates the signal by about 37%. For\nthe Dy-N4,5 off-resonance signal, no Beer's law correction was applied because the integration window receives\nsignal from the resonance while losing signal at the same\ntime. The simulation overestimates the Dy-N4,5 signal\nby a factor slightly less than 3. As discussed below, the\nlarger discrepancies for Sc-L2,3 and Dy-N4,5 indicate a\nbreak-down of either the single-particle model or assumptions in the processing of the experimental data.

(c) Comparison of experimental and simulated\nchemical mapping contrast.\n\nulations within the expected uncertainties, but highlight\nthe need to include multiple inelastic scattering.\nSimilar trends of agreement carry over to the contrasts\nin the chemical maps, as presented in Fig. 3(c). For example, the Dy-M5 contrast is reproduced closely by the\nsimulation (when the latter includes the effective source\ndistribution). The Sc-L2,3 contrast is slightly overestimated by the simulation, the discrepancy being around\n25% for thicknesses below 50 nm, and reducing to about\n15% for thicknesses greater than 50 nm. For the DyN4,5 off-resonance maps, the discrepancies are more significant, with the experimental contrast being lower by\nnearly a factor of 2. Nonetheless, the overall thicknessdependent trends of the experimental and simulated contrasts are in agreement for both Sc-L2,3 and Dy-N4,5 .\nThe discrepancies observed for Sc-L2,3 are likely due\nto one of three factors. Firstly, the L2,3 branching-ratio\nanomaly of Sc indicates that there is a large core hole\u2013\n3d interaction, implying that the single-particle model\nused in the simulations is not fully correct. Secondly, the\nfinal states for the Sc-L2,3 signal are sensitive to solid\nstate effects not included in the simulations. In line with\nthese observations, comparison of the experimental and\nsimulated Sc-L2,3 mean signal at 60 eV above threshold (not shown) exhibits substantially better agreement.\nThirdly, the Sc-L2,3 edge is sitting on a background signal whose spatial distribution changes with energy loss.\nIn the processing of experimental data, an extrapolation\nof the pre-edge intensities is used to extract the coreloss signals. The assumption of this procedure is that\nthe extrapolated background has the same spatial distri-\n\nbution as the pre-edge signal, and this assumption can\nbe invalid at low energy losses. In the case of Dy-N4,5 ,\nthe observed discrepancies are likely caused by the strong\nFano resonance [27\u201329]. As shown in Fig. 3(a), the DyN4,5 pre-edge intensities are negative due to the Fano\nresonance, making the background subtraction problematic. In addition, as exemplified in Fig. 2, the signal in\nthe Dy-N4,5 on-resonance maps spreads throughout the\nunit cell due to the relatively large spatial extent of the\n4d and 4f orbitals of Dy. Even though the Dy-N4,5 offresonance maps were extracted from about 50 eV above\nthe resonance, it is possible that a significant fraction of\nthe signal originates from the resonance. In contrast to\nthe Sc-L2,3 and Dy-N4,5 signals, the situation for Dy-M5\nis relatively simple. For example, the atomic-like final\nstates for the Dy-M5 signal fully justify the single-particle\natomic model used to compute the quantum-mechanical\nmatrix elements. Moreover, the relatively large energy\nloss gives rise to a slowly-varying background signal, ensuring validity of the background subtraction.\nIn conclusion, we have demonstrated the simultaneous acquisition of quantitative ADF images and EELS\nmaps in an aberration-corrected STEM. Coupled with\ndouble-channeling simulations of core-loss inelastic scattering, this has enabled a quantitative examination of\nthe core-loss signal utilized in atomic-resolution chemical\nmapping. We found that by taking into account the effective source distribution determined from the ADF images, both the absolute signal and the contrast in atomicresolution Dy-M5 maps can be closely reproduced by the\ndouble-channeling simulations. At lower energy losses,\ndiscrepancies are present in the Sc-L2,3 and Dy-N4,5\nmaps due to the energy-dependent spatial distribution of\nthe background spectrum, core-hole effects, and omitted\ncomplexities in the final states. This work has demonstrated the possibility of using quantitative STEM-EELS\nfor element-specific column-by-column atom counting at\nhigher energy losses and for atomic-like final states, and\nhas elucidated several possible improvements for future\nwork.\nFunded by the Energy Materials Center at Cornell, an Energy Frontier Research Center (DOE #DESC0001086).
