INTRODUCTION\nOver the past decade, the features in the cosmic microwave\nbackground angular power spectrum and galaxy clustering\npower spectrum due to the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO)\nhave emerged to be a premier standard ruler, and strong cosmological constraints have been derived using this technique\n(e.g., Spergel et al. 2003; Eisenstein et al. 2005; Cole et al.\n2005; Padmanabhan et al. 2007). In the galaxy BAO measurements, the tracer population of the large scale matter distribution often employed is the so-called luminous red galaxies (LRGs). These are massive elliptical galaxies characterized by an old and passively evolving stellar population\n(Eisenstein et al. 2001), and tend to be the dominant, central galaxies in group or cluster scale dark matter halos [e.g.,\nZheng et al. 2008; throughout this paper we do not refer to the\nmost luminous galaxy in clusters and groups differently, but\nsimply use the term brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs)].\nRecognizing the constraining power of BAO measurements, an impressive array of on-going and planned cosmological experiments have adopted this method as the main\nsurvey component (e.g., BOSS5 , WiggleZ6 , HETDEX7 , ATLAS8 , ADEPT, WFMOS). An important issue faced by these\nsurveys is the control of systematics, including e.g., the corrections for the galaxy bias and the redshift distortion. In\npractical terms, it is necessary to know the statistical properties of the BAO tracer population to exquisite detail (such as\nthe way they \"populate\" their host halos, and their luminosity\n1 Department of Astrophysical Sciences, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ 08544\n2 Departamento de Astronom\u00eda y Astrof\u00edsica, Pontificia Universidad\nCat\u00f3lica de Chile, Santiago, Chile\n3 Current address: Institute for the Physics and Mathematics of the Universe, University of Tokyo, Kashiwa, Chiba, Japan; yen-ting.lin@ipmu.jp\n4 Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory, La Serena, Chile\n5 http://www.sdss3.org/cosmology.php\n6 http://wigglez.swin.edu.au/Welcome.html\n7 http://www.as.utexas.edu/hetdex/\n8 http://www.astro.dur.ac.uk/Cosmology/vstatlas/\n\nfunction). As the LRGs are used as the tracer in most of the\naforementioned experiments, it is critical to test for the homogeneity of the LRG population. In this paper we address two\nkey questions: Are BCGs different from other cluster galaxies? Are BCGs distinct from non-BCG, luminous, red galaxies\nin clusters and groups?\nBecause of their brightness and uniformity in luminosity, the BCGs have long been regarded as an ideal standard candle (e.g., Humason et al. 1956; Scott 1957). Through\nthe systematic investigations separately lead by Sandage and\nGunn (e.g., Sandage 1972, 1973; Sandage & Hardy 1973;\nGunn & Oke 1975; Kristian et al. 1978; Hoessel et al. 1980;\nSchneider et al. 1983), however, it was realized that various\ncorrections [such as dependences of the BCG luminosity on\nthe cluster richness class (Abell 1958) and Bautz-Morgan type\n(Bautz & Morgan 1970), and the effect of galactic cannibalism (Ostriker & Tremaine 1975)] have to be applied before\nany cosmological implication from the BCG Hubble diagram\ncan be extracted.\nThe small dispersion in BCG luminosity (e.g., \u223c 0.3\nmag as determined by Sandage 1972) also stimulated\nthe discussion on their origin (Scott 1957; Peebles 1968;\nGeller & Peebles 1976; Tremaine & Richstone 1977;\nHausman & Ostriker 1978; Geller & Postman 1983;\nMerritt 1985; Bhavsar & Barrow 1985; Lin & Mohr\n2004; Loh & Strauss 2006; von der Linden et al. 2007;\nBernardi et al. 2007; Vale & Ostriker 2008, to name a few):\nwhether they are simply \"the brightest of the bright\" or a\ndifferent population from other cluster galaxies all together.\nIf the former hypothesis were true, the BCG luminosity\ndistribution (LD) simply results from sampling of an universal LD of all cluster galaxies, and its small dispersion\nin magnitude reflects the steepness of the bright end of the\nuniversal LD. To test for such a \"statistical nature\" of the\nBCGs, Tremaine & Richstone (1977, hereafter TR) devised a\ncouple of statistics based on the mean and dispersion of the\nmagnitude difference between the first- and second-ranked\n\n\f2\n\nLin, Ostriker, & Miller\n\ngalaxies (\u2206 and \u03c3\u2206 , respectively), and the dispersion of the\nBCG magnitude (\u03c31 ). The basic idea is that, if the BCGs are\nsimply the statistical extreme of the cluster galaxy population,\nboth \u03c31 and \u03c3\u2206 would be greater or comparable to \u2206. More\nspecifically, under the assumptions that (1) the numbers\nof galaxies in non-overlapping magnitude intervals are\nindependent random variables, and (2) the LD drops to zero\nrapidly at the extreme bright end9 , the following conditions\nneed to be satisfied: T1 \u2261 \u03c31 /\u2206 \u2265 1 and T2 \u2261 \u03c3\u2206 /\u2206 & 0.82\n(see also Loh & Strauss 2006).\nUsing LRGs to identify dense environments such as groups\nand clusters, Loh & Strauss (2006) found a large magnitude\ngap (\u2206 \u223c 0.8 mag) between the first- and second-ranked\ngalaxies in \u223c 12, 000 LRG-selected groups and clusters (for\nwhich the majority of the LRGs are the BCGs). They concluded that the LRGs are inconsistent with being the statistical extreme of the universal galaxy LD, based on the tests\nproposed by TR.\nOne fundamental issue faced by studies of very luminous\ngalaxies, such BCGs, concerns with their luminosity. On the\npractical side, for nearby BCGs, measuring their total light\nis nontrivial. The majority of BCGs are giant elliptical or\ncD galaxies, whose surface brightness profile is typically flatter than that of normal elliptical galaxies, and can extend to\ntens or hundreds of kpc (Tonry 1987). To measure the \"total\"\nmagnitude requires careful subtraction of the sky background.\nOn the physical side, the cD envelope may well extend into\nthe intracluster space, and it is sometimes difficult to separate the luminosity of the BCGs from that of the intracluster\nstars (e.g., Gonzalez et al. 2005). In this study we will use\ndata from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS, York et al.\n2000), which is not deep enough to detect contributions from\nthe intracluster stars. However, it is known that the current\nSDSS pipeline has difficulty handling photometry of galaxies\nwith large angular extents, and therefore may seriously underestimate the luminosity of BCGs (e.g., Lauer et al. 2007;\nvon der Linden et al. 2007; Abazajian et al. 2008). In such\ncases, \u2206 will be biased low. Although corrections to BCG\nphotometry (if at all possible) may decrease the value of T1 , it\nmay have the opposite effect on T2 , making the interpretation\nof the TR tests more difficult (see \u00a74.3).\nHere we propose a new way to examine the statistical nature of the BCGs that is less dependent on a robust measurement of the BCG luminosity and \u2206, and apply it to a large\nsample of nearby clusters. Our method is both conceptually\nand operationally very simple: with a sample of N clusters,\nwhose total galaxy luminosities are Ltot,i , where i = 1, 2, ...N,\none can combine all member galaxies to form a composite\ncluster. By drawing galaxies in random10 from the composite cluster to create N mock clusters whose total luminosities\nare matched to the observed ones (see Fig. 1), the most luminous mock galaxies constitute the \"statistical\" BCG sample.\nOne can then examine the distribution of the BCG luminosities (Lbcg ) for the observed and mock clusters. In particular,\nwe look for deviations from the statistical expectation from\nthe correlation between Lbcg and Ltot . As cluster luminosity is\n9 This condition is solely to ensure the integrals behave well in the TR\nanalysis. The \"extreme bright end\" can be at arbitrarily high luminosity\n(S. Tremaine 2009, private communication). Other than these two assumptions, we note that the form of the LD can be very general for the TR tests to\nbe applicable \u2013 the LD does not even have to be continuous.\n10 In the process of creating the N mock clusters, a galaxy can be picked\nmore than once, or not selected at all.\n\nF IG . 1.- An illustration of our method for obtaining the LD of all cluster galaxies, and for creating mock clusters. By combining member galaxies\nfrom all N clusters, we get a \"galaxy pool\" that by definition should be representative of the LD. By drawing galaxies in random from the galaxy pool\nwe then create N clusters whose total luminosities are matched as close as\npossible to the real ones (see \u00a73.1 for details). Our galaxy selection is limited\nto Mr = \u221220.\n\ncorrelated with its mass (e.g., Lin et al. 2004), a comparison\nof the Lbcg \u2013Ltot correlation between the observed and mock\nclusters may provide some insights into possible cluster mass\ndependence (if any) in the BCG formation mechanism(s).\nThe great virtue of the TR tests is that they only rely on a\nminimal set of assumptions concerning the nature of the LD,\nand is immune to any cluster-to-cluster variation. Our proposed test, on the other hand, although relying on the universality of the LD, is independent of the shape of the LD. In this\nsense the two approaches are highly complementary.\nIn \u00a72 we describe our cluster sample and the galaxy data.\nWe show the results of our tests in \u00a73, and present a comparison with the TR tests in \u00a73.3. We apply our test to the\nsecond brightest cluster galaxies (hereafter G2s) in \u00a73.4. Extensive tests have been carried out in order to show the robustness of our results (\u00a74). We conclude by discussing the\nimplications of our finding on the BCG formation scenarios\nand LRG-based BAO surveys in \u00a75.\nThroughout this paper we adopt a flat \u039bCDM cosmological\nmodel where \u03a9M = 1 \u2212 \u03a9\u039b = 0.3 and H0 = 70h70 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 .\n2. CLUSTER SAMPLE AND GALAXY DATA\n\nOur clusters are drawn from an updated version of the\nC4 cluster catalog (Miller et al. 2005), which uses data from\nthe fifth data release of the SDSS (Adelman-McCarthy et al.\n2007). Of the 2037 clusters in the sample, we restrict ourselves to 494 that lie within the redshift range z = 0.030 \u2212\n0.077, with velocity dispersion \u03c3 > 200 km/s, and contain at\nleast 2 luminous galaxies (see below). While the lower limit in\nredshift helps to alleviate problems in photometric measurements of bright galaxies with large angular extents in SDSS,\nthe upper limit is chosen to ensure that nearly all galaxies with\nMr \u2264 \u221220 have redshifts measured by SDSS (i.e., extinction-\n\n\fStatistical Nature of BCGs\ncorrected petrosian magnitude r p \u2264 17.77, among other selection criteria; Strauss et al. 2002). Note that the characteristic\nmagnitude for cluster red galaxies is M\u2217,r = \u221221.70 (see Table 4 below), based on our cluster sample. In addition, as we\nwill combine galaxies from all clusters to form a composite\ncluster, the small redshift range chosen prevents any redshift\nevolution within our cluster galaxy sample.\nOur first task is to assign cluster membership to galaxies in\nthe SDSS main sample. For every cluster, we include only\nred galaxies with redshift |z \u2212 zcl | \u2264 3\u03c3/c, with r-band absolute petrosian magnitude Mr \u2264 \u221220, and are projected within\n0.8h\u22121\n70 Mpc of the cluster center (defined as the peak of bright\ngalaxy density distribution; Miller et al. 2005). Here zcl and\nc are the cluster redshift and speed of light, respectively. A\ngalaxy is considered red if the model color u \u2212 r \u2265 2.2 (e.g.,\nStrateva et al. 2001). To calculate the absolute magnitudes,\nwe use the k-correction based on the NYU value-added galaxy\ncatalog (Blanton et al. 2005). In addition, a correction is made\nto convert the petrosian magnitudes into \"total\" magnitudes\nbased on the surface brightness profile of the galaxies, following Graham et al. (2005).\nOn average, about 94% of galaxies in the SDSS main sample have fibers assigned to them (Strauss et al. 2002). This\nfraction becomes smaller in crowded fields, such as the clusters (see Miller et al. 2005 and below), due to the size of the\nfiber plugs. It is therefore critical to correct for such an incompleteness when trying to include all cluster galaxies using\nthe SDSS main sample. For every cluster we first calculate\nthe mean g \u2212 r and r \u2212 i colors c\u0304gr and c\u0304ri of the spectroscopically confirmed member galaxies, then assume the galaxies that (1) satisfy the above selection criteria (u \u2212 r \u2265 2.2,\nr p \u2264 17.7, projected distance \u2264 0.8h\u22121\n70 Mpc), (2) were targeted for spectroscopy but were not assigned a fiber, and (3)\nhave |g \u2212 r \u2212 c\u0304gr | \u2264 0.15 and |r \u2212 i \u2212 c\u0304ri | \u2264 0.15 as probable cluster members (hereafter referred to as the photometric members). We treat these galaxies exactly the same way as those\nwith spectroscopic redshift measurements, and derive the absolute magnitudes by assuming they are at the cluster redshift.\nCombining the lists of the spectroscopic and photometric\nmembers, we record the absolute magnitudes of the galaxies for each cluster. The 5980 galaxies with Mr \u2264 \u221220 from\nall 494 clusters form our composite cluster, or a \"galaxy\npool\" that by definition has the statistical galaxy LD (see \u00a71).\nAmong these galaxies, 871 are photometric members (including 97 BCGs).\nIn our analysis we will construct two cluster subsamples\naccording to the total r-band luminosity Ltot from the member galaxies: a high-luminosity sample, consisting of 124 systems with Ltot > Ldiv \u2261 3.7 \u00d7 1011h\u22122\n70 L\u2299 , and a low-luminosity\nsample with 370 systems whose Ltot \u2264 Ldiv . The cluster luminosity Ltot is the sum of luminosities from all red member\ngalaxies (including the photometric members) more luminous\nthan Mr = \u221220, projected within a radius of 0.8h\u22121\n70 Mpc. As\nthe SDSS main sample has complete spectroscopic coverage\n(modulo fiber collision) for Mr \u2264 \u221220 for all our clusters, no\nextrapolation in the luminosity function is needed to obtain\nLtot . The division luminosity Ldiv is chosen so that each subsample contains roughly equal number of galaxies.\nIn Fig. 2 we show the distribution of number of galaxies\nfor the two subsamples. The histograms are normalized to the\ntotal number of clusters in the respective samples (red/solid:\nhigh-luminosity; blue/dashed: low-luminosity). We see that\n> 92% of low-luminosity systems have at least 5 red galaxies\n\n3\n\nF IG . 2.- The red/solid and blue/dashed histograms show the normalized\ndistribution of number of galaxies for the high- and low-luminosity subsamples, respectively. More than 92% of systems in the low-luminosity sample\ncontain at least 5 red galaxies (more luminous than Mr = \u221220, located within\n0.8h\u22121\n70 Mpc).\n\nF IG . 3.- The red/dotted and blue/dashed histograms show the normalized redshift distribution for the high- and low-luminosity subsamples, respectively. The two samples have similar distributions. For comparison, the\ngreen/solid curve shows the (arbitrarily) scaled differential comoving volume\nelement dV /dz. As the redshift distributions roughly follow dV /dz, our samples are close to volume-limited.\n\nabove our chosen magnitude limit. As we will show below,\nour results are not dependent on the faintest or most luminous\nsystems.\nFig. 3 presents the normalized redshift distribution\ndN/dz of the two subsamples (red/dotted: high-luminosity;\nblue/dashed: low-luminosity). We find that the two samples\nhave similar dN/dz: the median, mean, and 1\u03c3 scatter of the\nhigh-luminosity sample are 0.0662, 0.0624, and 0.0126, respectively. The same quantities for the low-luminosity sample\nare 0.0616, 0.0593, and 0.0126. The green/solid curve in the\nFigure is the differential comoving volume element dV /dz,\n\n\f4\n\nLin, Ostriker, & Miller\n\nscaled to the height of the distributions. The similarity between the redshift distributions and dV /dz suggests that our\nsamples are roughly volume-limited, and should be representative of the nearby groups and clusters.\n3. THE Lbcg \u2013Ltot CORRELATION AND THE\n\nSTATISTICAL NATURE OF BCGS\nCorrelations between the luminosity of the BCGs and the\nproperties of host clusters such as mass or total luminosity have been noted by previous studies (e.g., Lin & Mohr\n2004; Yang et al. 2005; Hansen et al. 2007). Here we utilize the BCG luminosity\u2013cluster luminosity correlation (Lbcg \u2013\nLtot ) to show that BCGs are indeed special \u2013 at least in luminous/massive clusters.\nIn Fig. 4 (top panel) we show the observed Lbcg \u2013Ltot correlation for the C4 clusters. The magenta squares in the top\npanel are the mean of BCG luminosity Lbcg,obs , as a function\nof Ltot . The meaning of the cyan crosses will be described\nbelow.\n3.1. The Mock Clusters and BCGs\nTo check for the statistical nature of BCGs, we proceed as\nfollows. Based on the observed LD, we generate many realizations of the Lbcg \u2013Ltot correlation, from which we derive the\nmean Lbcg \u2013Ltot relation that is expected if the BCGs are drawn\nfrom the same LD as other cluster galaxies. We can then compare the observed mean Lbcg \u2013Ltot relation and determine if it\nis consistent with the mean from the mock data.\nWe show in the middle panel of Fig. 4 one such realization. Basically, for each cluster in our sample, we create a\ncorresponding mock cluster by randomly drawing galaxies\nfrom the galaxy pool, until the total luminosity of the mock\ncluster matches that of the observed one (see also Fig. 1).\nSpecifically, suppose the first N galaxies give a total luminosity of LN < Ltot , and the next mock galaxy brings the total luminosity to LN+1 > Ltot . We keep the N + 1-th galaxy\nif LN+1 \u2212 Ltot < |LN \u2212 Ltot |, otherwise we only use the first N\ngalaxies. Because of this procedure, although the total luminosity for massive (luminous) clusters can be matched fairly\nwell, for low luminosity clusters the difference in Ltot between\nthe mock and real clusters can be large.\nThe black squares in the middle panels of Fig. 4 show the\nmean in BCG luminosity, Lbcg,sim in this particular ensemble of simulated clusters. The cyan crosses in both the top\nand middle panels are the mean of Lbcg,sim from 200 Monte\nCarlo realizations of the mock cluster ensemble, which we\ndenote as Lbcg,sim . It is found that for luminous clusters\n(e.g., Ltot > 3.7 \u00d7 1011h\u22122\n70 L\u2299 ), the observed Lbcg,obs is higher\nthan Lbcg,sim from mock clusters (e.g., compare the magenta\nsquares with the cyan crosses in the top panel). For low luminosity clusters, the observed and mock values are comparable.\nWe list in Table 1 the definition of various terms employed\nin this and the following subsections.\n3.2. Statistical Significance\nBy comparing the observed and mock Lbcg \u2013Ltot correlations\nwe infer that BCGs in real clusters have systematically higher\nluminosities than the mock BCGs. One might easily imagine\na systematic measurement error that systematically gives too\nlarge a luminosity for bright galaxies. But that would not produce the effect we find. One would need a systematic error\nthat increased the brightness of BCGs but had a less dramatic\n\nF IG . 4.- The Lbcg \u2013Ltot correlation for the real clusters (top panel) and one\nof the Monte Carlo realizations of mock cluster ensemble (middle panel).\nThe squares in the top and middle panel are the mean of the BCG luminosity for the real and the mock clusters (Lbcg,obs and Lbcg,sim ), respectively.\nAlso shown in both panels as crosses are the mean BCG luminosity averaged\nover 200 Monte Carlo realizations, Lbcg,sim . In the bottom panel we show\nthe distribution of dobs = log Lbcg,obs \u2212 log Lbcg,sim (blue solid points) and\ndsim = log Lbcg,sim \u2212 log Lbcg,sim (red open points). The real BCGs are systematically more luminous than the statistical ones in luminous clusters. The\nerrorbars of dobs are derived from 200 bootstrap resampling of the observed\nLbcg \u2013Ltot correlation.\n\neffect on second brightest galaxies in other (more luminous)\nclusters of the same intrinsic luminosity. Here we quantify the\nsignificance of the difference between the two populations.\nUsing 200 realizations of the mock cluster ensemble (each\ncontaining 494 clusters), we calculate Lbcg,sim , as well as\nthe difference between logarithms of the mean BCG luminosity Lbcg,sim from individual realizations and Lbcg,sim , dsim =\nlog Lbcg,sim \u2212 log Lbcg,sim . By dividing the cluster sample into\n15 bins in Ltot , each containing roughly equal number of clusters, for each mock cluster ensemble we have 15 evaluations\nof the statistic dsim . One such example is shown in the lower\npanel of Fig. 4 (open red symbols). We see that dsim roughly\nscatters about zero. We expect that for mock clusters, the distribution of dsim should follow a Gaussian, which is shown as\nthe blue histogram in the top panel of Fig. 5.

The\ndistribution of d for the high (low) luminosity subsample is\nshown in the middle (bottom) panel. As we note above, in\nhigh luminosity clusters the real BCGs are on average more\nluminous than the mock ones, resulting positive dobs , and\nthere is only a 0.028% probability that they are drawn from\nthe same LD, based on a KS test. On the other hand, Lbcg,obs\nin low luminosity clusters scatter about Lbcg,sim , and dobs\nand dsim have a much higher probability (P = 54.5%) to be\ndrawn from the same distribution. These results are recorded\nin Table 2 (the column under \"galaxy pool\"; for meaning of\nthe other columns, see \u00a74.2).\n\nF IG . 5.- Distribution of the statistic d, defined as the difference between\nlogarithms of the mean BCG luminosity Lbcg and the mean of Lbcg,sim from\n200 Monte Carlo realizations of the mock cluster ensemble. The distribution\nof the observed dobs is shown as the blue histograms, while that for the mock\nclusters is shown as the red ones. The top, middle, and bottom panels show\nthe results for the whole cluster sample (494 systems), for high luminosity\nclusters (Ltot > Ldiv = 3.7 \u00d7 1011 h\u22122\n70 L\u2299 ; 124 systems), and for low luminosity\nclusters (Ltot \u2264 Ldiv ; 370 systems), respectively. In each panel the green\ndotted curve is a Gaussian fit to the red histogram. For the high luminosity\nclusters the difference between the real and mock data is significant at the\n0.028% level (see Table 2).\n\nis a Gaussian fit to the histogram.\nWe can similarly calculate dobs = log Lbcg,obs \u2212 log Lbcg,sim\nfor the real clusters. We show dobs as a function of Ltot in\nthe lower panel of Fig. 4 as the solid blue points; it is apparent that dobs correlates positively with cluster luminosity.\nThe errorbars of dobs are derived from 200 bootstrap resampling of the observed Lbcg \u2013Ltot correlation. The distribution\nof dobs is further shown as the red dashed histogram in the\ntop panel of Fig. 5, and is clearly different from a Gaussian.\nA Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test shows that the probability of dobs to be drawn from the same distribution of dsim is\n\n3.3. Tremaine-Richstone Tests\nNext we compare our results with those from the TR tests.\nBased on the whole cluster sample, we find that \u03c31 = 0.58,\n\u2206 = 0.62, and \u03c3\u2206 = 0.49, resulting in T1 = \u03c31 /\u2206 = 0.93 and\nT2 = \u03c3\u2206 /\u2206 = 0.78. Recall that if the BCGs are \"statistical\",\nwe would have obtained T1 \u2265 T1,lim = 1 and T2 & T2,lim = 0.82\n(\u00a71; but see below). Note that these lower limits are derived under rather general assumptions about the form of the\nLD (TR). For example, assuming the underlying LD follows\nthe Schechter (1976) form, the limits are T1,lim,sch \u2248 1.16 and\nT2,lim,sch \u2248 0.88.\nDividing the clusters into high and low luminosity subsamples (using the same division luminosity Ldiv as in \u00a73.2),\nwe find (\u03c31 , \u2206, \u03c3\u2206 , T1 , T2 ) = (0.39, 0.55, 0.43, 0.70, 0.79) and\n(0.54, 0.65, 0.50, 0.84, 0.77), respectively. That T1 for the\nwhole sample is larger than T1 for both high and low luminosity subsamples is due to the weak, positive correlation between Lbcg and Ltot .\nBoth our test and the TR tests indicate that, using the whole\ncluster sample, the BCGs are not drawn from the same LD\nas other cluster galaxies. Separating the low luminosity clusters from the luminous ones, our test suggests that this conclusion is mainly driven by the BCGs in the luminous clusters. The T1 statistic implies a larger deviation from the\nstatistical expectation for BCGs in high luminosity clusters\n\n\f6\n\nLin, Ostriker, & Miller\n\n(T1,lim \u2212 T1 = 0.30), compared to their counterparts in less luminous clusters (T1,lim \u2212 T1 = 0.16).\nIt is important to quantify how significant are the deviations\nof the Ti (i = 1, 2) values we observe from the statistical limits.\nWithout assuming any particular form of the LD, we evaluate\nthe significance empirically, using the \"galaxy pool\" from all\nthe member galaxies. More specifically, we construct ensembles of mock clusters following the method described in \u00a73.1;\nwe can then derive the mean and dispersion of the two statistics from the distributions of T1 and T2 based on the mock\nclusters (see Fig. 6). For all clusters in our sample, when\nthe BCGs are generated statistically, the mean and standard\ndeviation of the two statistics are T1 = 1.01, \u03c3T1 = 0.05, and\nT2 = 0.90, \u03c3T2 = 0.03. We find that about 3.5% of the Monte\nCarlo realizations have T1 as low as the observed value (0.93),\nbut only 0.007% have T2 as low as 0.78, the observed value.\nWe denote these fractions as p1 \u2261 p1 (\u2264 T1,obs ) and p2 \u2261 p2 (\u2264\nT2,obs ). For high luminosity clusters, (T1 , \u03c3T1 , p1 , T2 , \u03c3T2 , p2 ) =\n(0.96, 0.08, 0.014%, 0.84, 0.06, 14%). For low luminosity\nones, the values are (0.90, 0.05, 8.8%, 0.88, 0.04, 0.07%).\nAdditionally, we can estimate the distribution of the observed Ti via bootstrap resampling. The overlapping area under the \"observed\" and the \"statistical\" distributions (the latter from the mock cluster ensembles, as mentioned above)\nthen gives an estimate of the likelihood that the observed Ti\nis consistent with the statistical expectation. We denote the\nlikelihood as qi \u2261 qi (Ti,obs \u2229 Ti,stat ), i = 1, 2. For the whole\ncluster sample, we find (q1 , q2 ) = (8.8%, 1.4%), For high and\nlow luminosity clusters, the results are (0.35%, 23.4%) and\n(14.9%, 0.64%), respectively.\nFor clarity, these results are summarize in Table 3. We\npresent the results for the whole sample, as well as the high\nand low luminosity subsamples. For each (sub)sample, the\nnumbers under \"obs.\" are the observed values, and the triplet\nof numbers under \"stat.\" denotes the mean and standard deviation of the TR statistics based on 105 ensembles of mock\ndatasets, and pi (i = 1, 2). Looking at p1 for the high and\nlow luminosity clusters, one would conclude that BCGs in\nthe faint clusters are much more likely to be statistical. One\nwould draw the opposite conclusion if considering the T2\nstatistic, however. It is therefore not clear if the TR tests give\na consistent picture (e.g., dependence on Ltot ) for the degree\nof deviation of BCGs from the galaxy population in clusters.\nUsing a large group sample from SDSS, Yang et al. (2008)\nexamined the gap statistics. Although they did not explicitly\ncalculate the values of Ti , using the results presented in their\nFig. 7, we can roughly estimate that for clusters with virial\nmass log M \u2248 14.8, (T1 , T2 ) \u223c (1.4, 0.7), and for clusters with\nlog M \u2248 14.0, (T1 , T2 ) \u223c (0.6, 0.8). We see that the Ti values\nhave opposite trends with cluster mass: based on T1 , the BCGs\nin low mass systems are special; using T2 one would be lead\nto the opposite conclusion.\nIn their study of LRG-selected groups and clusters, Loh & Strauss (2006) found that (\u03c31 , \u2206, \u03c3\u2206 , T1 , T2 ) =\n(0.30, 0.87, 0.52, 0.35, 0.59) at z \u2248 0.12. They also examined\nthe richness dependence of the TR statistics. For the richest systems (75% \u2212 100% quartile in the richness distribution)\nthey found (T1 , T2 ) = (0.75, 0.71); for those with richness in the\n25% \u2212 50% quartile (with about 2 \u2212 3 galaxies on the red sequence), (T1 , T2 ) = (0.27, 0.34). The results of Loh & Strauss\n(2006) suggest a dependence of the TR statistics on richness\nthat is opposite to our findings (if their richness estimator correlates well with the total luminosity).\n\nThe main cause for the differences seems to be in the\nmagnitude gap, \u2206. Although for the richest systems,\nLoh & Strauss (2006) obtained \u2206 \u223c 0.55, a value comparable to ours, their finding of \u2206 \u223c 1 for the much poorer systems (25% \u2212 50% quartile in richness) is much higher than\nour value. Because Loh & Strauss (2006) looked for galaxy\nconcentrations around LRGs using (primarily) photometric\ndata, we suspect many of their low-richness systems may\nnot be real, but simply chance projections of galaxies with\nsimilarly red colors (c.f. purity of the maxBCG algorithm;\nsee Koester et al. 2007). On the other hand, we note that\nYang et al. (2008) also found that \u2206 & 1 for their low mass\nsystems (log M \u223c 13).\nThese results seem to suggest that, when considered together, the two TR statistics may not unambiguously determine the statistical nature of BCGs with respect to cluster\nmass (or its proxy, such as total galaxy number or luminosity).\nThe disagreements among the different studies may be attributed to several factors (such as the way BCGs are selected,\nthe way background contamination is treated, or even the\ngroup/cluster selection). A possible resolution would be to\ncompare the selection of BCG and G2 on a cluster-by-cluster\nbasis, for the clusters that are present in multiple catalogs.\n3.4. Are G2s Special?\nWe have applied a new method to confirm that the BCGs are\nspecial. This approach can be used to check if G2s are statistical, that is, are their LD consistent with that of the overall\ncluster galaxy population. The results can then be used to answer the second question we set out to address: Are BCGs\ndifferent from other luminous, red, cluster galaxies?\nWe proceed in a similar fashion as in the previous sections.\nThe main difference is that we are now comparing the observed Lg2 \u2013Ltot correlation with the corresponding mean relation from mock clusters. Requiring that mock clusters must\nhave at least two members causes a small modification to the\nway mock clusters are constructed, which mainly affects the\nlow luminosity clusters. Therefore we will set a lower luminosity limit at Llim = 1.6 \u00d7 1011 h\u22122\n70 L\u2299 , and define the low\nluminosity subsample (234 systems) with Llim \u2264 Ltot \u2264 Ldiv ,\nwhere Ldiv = 3.7 \u00d7 1011h\u22122\n70 L\u2299 . The 124-cluster high luminosity subsample remains the same as before.\nIn Fig. 7 we show the distribution of the quantity d for G2s,\nwhich is analogous to Fig. 5 for the BCGs. The bottom, middle, and top panels are the results for the low luminosity subsample, high luminosity subsample, and the combined sample (358 systems), respectively. In all samples considered, we\nfind that G2s are consistent with the statistical expectation.\nKS tests suggest that P = 26%, 55%, and 24% for all, high,\nand low luminosity clusters, respectively. Our results are not\nsensitive to the exact value of Llim .\nThis result immediately suggests that BCGs are distinct\nfrom G2s, and very likely, other luminous member galaxies.\nThis simple exercise also demonstrates one advantage of\nour method over the TR tests: while the latter by definition\ncould not determine the statistical nature of G2s, our method\ncan in principle be applied to even the third- or lower-ranked\nmember galaxies.\n4. SYSTEMATICS\n\nIn this section we examine the robustness of our findings\non various aspects in the analysis, including the selection of\n\n\fStatistical Nature of BCGs\n\n7\n\nF IG . 6.- Distribution of the T1 and T2 values for the real clusters (based on 5000 bootstrap resampling) and mock clusters (derived from 105 ensembles). The\nleft panels show the distribution for T1 , while the right panels are for T2 . From top to bottom, we show the results for all the clusters, high and low luminosity\nsubsamples, respectively. In each panel, the solid histogram is the distribution of the mock clusters (with the short solid arrow indicating the mean value), and\nthe dotted histogram is that for the real clusters (with the mean indicated by the short dotted arrow). The overlapping area under the solid and dotted histograms\nrepresents an estimate of the likelihood the observed value is consistent with the statistical expectations (see Table 3). Looking at the middle left panel (for T1\nvalues of high luminosity clusters), one sees that the dotted histogram is at the extreme of the solid red histogram, and would conclude that BCGs are unlikely to\nbe statistical (based on the T1 statistic). However, in the middle right panel (for T2 ), the dotted histogram is well within the dotted blue histogram, suggesting the\nBCGs are statistical. The opposite situation happens when one looks at the bottom panels (for low luminosity clusters).\n\nTABLE 3\nT REMAINE -R ICHSTONE S TATISTICS\nobs.a\nT1\nT2\n\n(0.93,0.01)\n(0.78,0.01)\n\nall clusters\nstat.b\n(1.01, 0.05)\n(0.90, 0.03)\n\n(p, q)c\n\nobs.a\n\nluminous clusters\nstat.b\n\n(p, q)c\n\nobs.a\n\nfaint clusters\nstat.b\n\n(p, q)c\n\n(3.5, 8.8)\n(0.007, 0.145)\n\n(0.70,0.01)\n(0.79,0.01)\n\n(0.96, 0.08)\n(0.85, 0.06)\n\n(0.01, 0.35)\n(14, 23)\n\n(0.84,0.01)\n(0.77,0.01)\n\n(0.90, 0.05)\n(0.88, 0.04)\n\n(8.8, 14.9)\n(0.07, 0.64)\n\na observed value and the standard deviation based on 5000 bootstrap resampling.\nb statistical expectation and the standard deviation based on 105 Monte Carlo realizations.\nc p is the proportion of the Monte Carlo realizations that give TR statistics as low as the observed value. q is the area of the overlapping region under the observed\n\nand statistical distribution of the TR values (see Fig. 6).

Sensitivity on Galaxy and Cluster Sample Selection\nWe first check the sensitivity of our results on the galaxy\nselection criteria, by repeating our test using a much more\nstringent set of conditions to assign cluster memberships for\nred galaxies. In addition to the basic requirements (u \u2212 r \u2265 2.2,\nr p \u2264 17.7, projected within 0.8h\u22121\n70 Mpc), for the spectroscopic\nmembers, we only include galaxies whose (1) redshifts satisfy\nc|z \u2212 zcl | \u2264 v, where v \u2261 min(2\u03c3, 1500 km/s), (2) g \u2212 r and r \u2212 i\n\ncolors fall in the range c\u0304 \u2212 1.5\u03c3c to c\u0304 + 2.5\u03c3c , where c\u0304 and \u03c3c\nare the mean and dispersion of the g \u2212 r and r \u2212 i colors from\nthe galaxies at redshifts broadly consistent with the cluster,\n(3) \"concentration parameter\" cm \u2261 r90 /r50 \u2265 2.6, where r90\nand r50 are radii that enclose 90% and 50% of the Petrosian\nflux, respectively; this last condition aims to select galaxies\nwith early type morphology (Strateva et al. 2001). As for the\nphotometric members, along with the filters in the r-band flux,\nu \u2212 r color, spatial distribution, and morphology, we require\nthat their g \u2212 r and r \u2212 i colors to lie between c\u0304 \u2212 \u03c3c and c\u0304 +\n1.5\u03c3c , where c\u0304 and \u03c3c are now derived from the spectroscopic\nmembers.\n\n\f8\n\nLin, Ostriker, & Miller\nneed to host at least two galaxies with Mr \u2264 \u221220 potentially\nexcludes systems dominated by a single \u223c M\u2217 galaxy, such\nas the \"fossil groups\" (which are defined to have \u2206 \u2265 2 and\nextended X-ray emissions). These systems are believed to\nevolve in isolation, with last major merger with other galactic\nsystems being long enough in the past that a dominant central galaxy can result from the dynamic friction (Ponman et al.\n1994). The BCGs in these groups would then deviate significantly from the statistical extreme, which makes them distinct from the other BCGs in low luminosity groups included\nin our sample. One might be concerned that the exclusion of\nfossil groups from our cluster sample may have contributed to\nour conclusion that, for the lower luminosity systems, there is\nno statistically significant deviation of BCGs from the statistical distribution of all cluster galaxies. However, given the\nrarity of the fossils (number density \u223c 2 \u00d7 10\u22126 h370 Mpc\u22123 ;\ne.g., La Barbera et al. 2009; Voevodkin et al. 2009), we expect there to be at most \u223c 20 such systems in the volume we\nsample (z = 0.03 \u2212 0.077, \u2248 5700 deg2 ), and therefore our conclusion should be robust.\n\nF IG . 7.- Distribution of the statistic d for G2. The distribution of the observed dobs is shown as the blue/dashed histograms, while that for the mock\nclusters is shown as the red/solid ones.

We find\nthat the probability P that dobs and dsim are drawn from the\nsame distribution is 1.5%, 0.15%, and 67% for the whole,\nhigh luminosity, and low luminosity (sub)samples. These values confirm the results found in \u00a73.2.\nWe note in \u00a72 that 20% (\u2248 97/494) of the BCGs are\nphotometrically identified. Some of these may be foreground/background galaxies. To evaluate the effect of possible contamination due to these photometric BCGs, we repeat our analysis using the 397 clusters whose BCGs are\nspectroscopically confirmed members (with the membership\nassignment criteria of \u00a72). Based on the galaxy pool constructed from the 3661 galaxies in these clusters, we find that\nP = 1.7%, 0.28%, and 27%, for the whole, high luminosity,\nand low luminosity (sub)samples.\nAlthough the absolute values of P changes somewhat with\nrespect to our nominal values recorded in Table 2, the trend\nremains clear that the BCGs in high luminosity clusters are\nmuch less likely to be drawn from the same LD as other cluster members when compared to their counterparts in lower\nluminosity clusters.\nLet us comment next on one effect our cluster selection\nmay have on the results. The requirement that the clusters\n\n4.2. Construction of Mock Clusters\nWe first investigate whether the way galaxy pool is constructed affects our results. Instead of pouring galaxies from\nall clusters into one pool, we can create two pools separately\nfor galaxies in high and low luminosity clusters. High and low\nluminosity mock clusters are then created from the respective\npools. We find that P = 0.98% and 92% for the high and low\nluminosity clusters, respectively. The trend is clear that BCGs\nin low luminosity clusters are far more likely to be the statistical extreme than their cousins in high luminosity systems.\nSecondly, we note that instead of utilizing the galaxy pool,\nwe can construct mock clusters using fits to the observed LD\nof cluster galaxies. The LDs for the whole cluster sample,\nand for the high and low luminosity subsamples, are measured\nby the method developed in Lin & Mohr (2004), to which we\nrefer the reader for more details. The results are shown in\nFig. 8. From top to bottom are the LDs for the high luminosity\nclusters, the whole sample, and the low luminosity clusters.\nWhen BCGs are included, the Schechter function is not a\ngood description of the LDs. Instead, the bright end may\nbe more appropriately described by a log-normal distribution.\nTherefore, in fitting the LDs we consider both a bright endtruncated Schechter function plus a Gaussian,\n( ln 10\n\u03b1+1\nexp (\u2212M)\ndM if M \u2265 Mch\n2.5 \u03c6\u2217 M\n\u0011\n\u0010\n(1)\n\u03c6(M)dM =\n(M\u2212M\u0303\u2217 )2\ndM\notherwise\n\u03c6\u0303\u2217 exp \u2212 2\u03c32\nM\n\nwhere M = 10\u22120.4(M\u2212M\u2217 ) , and a single Schechter function. The\nbest-fit parameters are given in Table 4.\nUsing the Gaussian+Schechter function fit to the whole\nsample as the LD, we find that for the whole, high, and low\nluminosity samples, P = 0.47%, 0.013%, and 39%, respectively. If using the Schechter function fit to the LD of the\nwhole sample, P = 0.57%, 0.015%, and 44% for the three\n(sub)samples, respectively. These results are recorded in the\nthird and fourth columns of Table 2.\nWe thus conclude that our results are robust irrespective of\nthe way the mock clusters are constructed. Another implication from this exercise is that our method does not rely on\nlargely complete spectroscopic dataset like SDSS; as long as\n(1) one can determine the LD accurately (e.g., via a statistical background subtraction method; Lin et al. 2004), and (2)\n\n\fStatistical Nature of BCGs\n\n9\n\nTABLE 4\nL UMINOSITY D ISTRIBUTION PARAMETERS IN r- BAND\nsingle Schechter\n\u03c6\u2217\nM\u2217\n\nsample\n\n\u03b1\n\nall\nhigh\nlow\n\n\u22121.01\n\u22121.17\n\u22120.93\n\n8.53\n12.62\n6.34\n\n\u221221.92\n\u221222.13\n\u221221.78\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u03c6\u2217\n\n\u22120.93\n\u22120.99\n\u22120.73\n\n10.25\n18.30\n8.92\n\nGaussian+Schechtera\nM\u2217\nMch\n\u03c6\u0303\u2217\n\u221221.70\n\u221221.73\n\u221221.28\n\n\u221222.40\n\u221222.60\n\u221222.05\n\n1.38\n1.90\n1.35\n\nM\u0303\u2217\n\n2\n\u03c3M\n\n\u221222.25\n\u221222.57\n\u221221.98\n\n0.32\n0.25\n0.33\n\na see Eq. 1 for the definition of the parameters.\n\nF IG . 8.- Composite LDs in the r-band for the 494 C4 clusters at z =\n0.030 \u2212 0.077.

Sensitivity on Photometry of BCGs\nWe remark in \u00a71 concerning the difficulty in the measurement of the total light of the BCGs. Here we examine the effect of underestimation of BCG luminosity (and more generally, luminosity of galaxies with large angular extents) on both\nour test and the TR tests. We address this issue by using two\nmethods to obtain the best estimates of the true galaxy magnitudes for our galaxy sample. The first one is a re-measurement\nof the galaxy photometry from the reduced SDSS images for\nevery galaxy in our sample. The second one employs a statistical correction to the official SDSS photometry.\nSimply put, the reason that the SDSS photometric pipeline\nhas difficulties dealing with the photometry of large galaxies\nis because it is defaulted to use the \"local\" sky flux measured\nwithin regions of 256 \u00d7 256 pixels (1.7\u2032 \u00d7 1.7\u2032 ) in the CCD\nframes. In the case that a large fraction of a given region is\noccupied by galaxies, the sky background level will be biased\nhigh, and in turn the galaxy magnitude will be lower than the\ntrue value. A remedy is to use the \"global\" sky level measured in frames of 2048 \u00d7 1498 pixels (13.5\u2032 \u00d7 9.8\u2032). Following this line of reasoning, von der Linden et al. (2007) devised\na way to recover the true magnitude, given the crowdedness\nof a field, and the relative values of the local and global sky\nbackground.\nAs our first approach, we adopt the methodology of\nvon der Linden et al. (2007) to apply corrections to the mag-\n\nnitudes of the galaxies and change the cluster luminosity accordingly, and then use the modified galaxy catalogs (and the\ngalaxy pool) to conduct our test and the TR tests. It is found\nthat P = 1.2%, 0.012%, and 49%, for the whole, high luminosity, and low luminosity cluster (sub)samples, respectively.\nAs for the TR tests, for the whole sample, (T1 , p1 , T2 , p2 ) =\n(0.99, 11.1%, 0.77, 2 \u00d7 10\u22124); for the high and low luminosity\nsubsamples, (T1 , p1 , T2 , p2 ) = (0.68, 5 \u00d7 10\u22125 , 0.77, 2.4%) and\n(0.84, 7.1%, 0.77, 3 \u00d7 10\u22124), respectively.\nUsing an independent photometric reduction software,\nHyde & Bernardi (2009) quantified the degree of underestimation of the magnitudes of large galaxies by the official\nSDSS pipeline. Their tests suggest that, for early type galaxies with effective radius \u2248 10\u2032\u2032 , the mean magnitude deficit\nis about 0.25 mag, with a 68% scatter about 0.04 mag. They\nprovided a fitting function that gives the mean deficit \u2206m as\na function of the angular size \u03b8, which we use as the basis of\nour second method for recovering the true galaxy magnitudes.\nFor every galaxy in our sample, we assume its magnitude was\nunderestimated by the SDSS pipeline by \u2206m(\u03b8) + \u03b4m, where\n\u03b4m is a Gaussian random variate with dispersion of 0.04 mag,\nand \u03b8 is determined from the de Vaucouleur fits to the galaxy\nsurface brightness profile (see Hyde & Bernardi 2009 for details).\nFor the galaxy and cluster catalogs thus modified, we find\nthat (T1 , T2 ) = (0.99, 0.77) for the whole sample, and the probability to obtain T1 and T2 from the galaxy pool as low as the\n\"observed\" values is 11.3% and 8 \u00d7 10\u22125 , respectively. On\nthe other hand, the probability that dobs and dsim are drawn\nfrom the same distribution is P = 1.2%. Breaking the sample into high and low luminosity subsamples, the results are\n(T1 , p1 , T2 , p2 ) = (0.68, 5 \u00d7 10\u22125, 0.78, 2.2%) for the luminous\nclusters, and (0.84, 7.5%, 0.77, 2 \u00d7 10\u22124) for the faint clusters.\nFrom our test we find that BCGs in high and low luminosity\nclusters have probabilities of P = 0.012% and P = 49% to be\nstatistical.\nThese results suggest that both our test and the TR tests are\ninsensitive to the uncertainties in galaxy photometry due to\nsky subtraction.\nIt is also important to check if the low luminosity clusters\nare systematically at lower redshifts than the luminous ones.\nIf this were true, the issue with sky subtraction of the SDSS\npipeline may affect the photometry of BCGs in low luminosity clusters (hereafter LLCBCG) more strongly than that of\nBCGs in high luminosity clusters (hereafter HLCBCG), causing the photometry of LLCBCG to be underestimated more\nthan the case for HLCBCG. This would in turn affect our finding that LLCBCG are consistent with being drawn from the\nsame LD as other cluster galaxies (\u00a73.2). We have shown in\n\u00a72 that the high and low luminosity clusters have very similar\nredshift distribution, and therefore we do not think the photometry of LLCBCG and HLCBCG is treated differently.\n\n\f10\n\nLin, Ostriker, & Miller\n5. DISCUSSIONS AND SUMMARY\n\n5.1. Implications on BCG Formation\nThe main result of the present study is that BCGs as a whole\nhave a LD that is distinct from that of the majority of red\ncluster galaxies (those with Mr \u2264 \u221220). This conclusion is\nprimarily due to the high luminosities of HLCBCG, which\nhas only 0.03% of probability to be drawn from the LD of\nall galaxies. On the contrary, LLCBCG are more likely to be\nsimply the statistical extreme of the LD of all galaxies.\nWith the help of mock clusters, and the elements that come\ninto the calculation of TR tests, one gains some insight into\nthe BCG formation process. For high luminosity clusters, we\nfind that (\u03c31 , \u03c3\u2206 , \u2206) = (0.39, 0.43, 0.55) from the real data,\nwhile the corresponding values from the mock dataset are\n(0.42, 0.37, 0.44). Therefore, although \u03c31 in real and mock\nclusters are comparable, in real clusters \u2206 is higher that that\nin mock ones (suggesting that real BCGs are on average 0.11\nmag brighter than the statistical extrme). Physics of BCG formation drives the magnitude gap to be larger than the statistical expectation.\nTo explain the origin of HLCBCG, one therefore needs\nto invoke galactic mergers (e.g., Ostriker & Tremaine\n1975; Hausman & Ostriker 1978; Lin & Mohr 2004;\nCooray & Milosavljevi\u0107 2005; Vale & Ostriker 2008), which\nis naturally expected within the hierarchical structure formation paradigm (e.g., Dubinski 1998; De Lucia & Blaizot\n2007). However, the details of the mergers (e.g., major\nmergers between BCG and very luminous galaxies, minor\nmergers between BCG and M\u2217 -type galaxies, or the \"galactic\ncannibalism\"11) remain to be understood. For example, while\nLin & Mohr (2004) suggested that major mergers are a viable\nroute for forming HLCBCG, Vale & Ostriker (2008) were\nmore in favor of minor mergers.\nIn principle, the extent of late mergers can be constrained\nby the Lbcg \u2013Ltot correlation, or statistics related to the magnitude gap between BCG and second-ranked galaxy (e.g.,\nMilosavljevi\u0107 et al. 2006; Yang et al. 2008). We have developed a simple merger model for cluster galaxies, and will\npresent constraints on the importance of mergers based on the\nobservations obtained in this paper in a future publication (Lin\n& Ostriker 2009, in preparation).\nAfter confirming that BCGs are indeed different from the\nbulk of cluster galaxy population, it is natural to ask if BCGs\nare different from other luminous/massive cluster galaxies\n(e.g., M . M\u2217 \u2212 1). It has long been known that BCGs follow\ndifferent scaling relations from other early type galaxies (e.g.,\nOegerle & Hoessel 1991; Lauer et al. 2007; Desroches et al.\n2007; Bernardi et al. 2007), in the sense that the BCGs are\nlarger, less dense, and have lower velocity dispersion, compared to other early type galaxies of the same luminosity.\nHowever, at the present it is not clear if the structure of the\nBCGs (in terms of Sersic fits) is indeed different from nonBCG early type galaxies of comparable color and stellar mass\n(see Guo et al. 2009).\nWe address this question somewhat indirectly; in \u00a73.4 it is\nshown that the LD of G2s in high luminosity clusters are consistent with that of the whole cluster galaxy population. (Our\n11 We would like to point out that cannibalism proposed by Ostriker and\nco-workers is not binary mergers per se. It is based on the computable tendency of the most massive stellar systems to spiral to the centers of clusters\nvia dynamical friction and to merge with other systems already resident at the\ncenter.\n\nmethod could not be robustly applied to examine the statistical nature of G2s in low luminosity clusters, unfortunately.)\nAlthough we do not check the third-ranked brightest members, we believe a similar result will emerge for them. Effectively, we suggest that among the most luminous, red, cluster\nmembers, only BCGs in high luminosity clusters show significant deviations from the statistical extreme, and therefore\nthese galaxies are a distinct population.\nOur results suggest both BCGs in low luminosity/mass\nclusters and G2s in luminous/massive clusters are the statistical extreme of the galaxy LD. As the latter are very likely\nBCGs (in clusters or groups that merge with the current host\nclusters) themselves at earlier stages of their lives, this finding\nseems to give a self-consistent picture of the luminous galaxy\nevolution within the hierarchical cluster evolution scenario.\n5.2. Cosmological Implications\nThe results and reasoning presented in \u00a73.4 & \u00a75.1 suggest\nthat LRGs that are BCGs in high luminosity (massive) clusters\nare different from other LRGs (e.g., those that are LLCBCG\nand G2s or lower-ranked galaxies in high luminosity clusters),\nand call for very careful modeling and selection of the LRGs.\nSuppose the finding that HLCBCG and LLCBCG are two\ndistinct populations continues to hold towards higher redshifts. In a flux-limited survey, the LRGs at higher redshifts\nwould be intrinsically more luminous than those at lower-z.\nTherefore, a larger fraction of LRGs at higher-z would be\ncomposed of HLCBCG, when compared to LRGs at lowerz. When accounting for the Malmquist bias present in the\nLRG sample, one cannot simply assume that BCGs follow\nthe same LD as LRGs as a whole, otherwise the inferred luminosity would be lower than the true value. This potential\nsystematic effect would be larger towards higher-z.\nIt is thus important to take into account the difference\nin the LD of HLCBCG and LLCBCG when creating mock\nLRG catalogs for BAO surveys. Unfortunately the BCGs in\nthe present study are at lower redshifts (z < 0.1) even compared to SDSS and SDSS-II LRG studies (at z \u223c 0.3; e.g.,\nEisenstein et al. 2005), and therefore the LDs we measure (see\nthe Gaussian fits in Table 4) are not readily applicable. Accordingly our study strongly motivates for a systematic investigation on the Lbcg \u2013Ltot correlation at z > 0.3, either through\ndirect observations (similar to the methodology used in the\npresent paper, utilizing spectroscopic data from e.g., BOSS\nor GAMA surveys), through the halo occupation distribution analysis (e.g., Zheng et al. 2008), or the non-parametric\nmethod of Vale & Ostriker (2006).\n5.3. Summary\nThe question of whether the luminosity distribution of\nBCGs is drawn from the same LD as other cluster galaxies has\nbeen extensively discussed over the last four decades. Here\nwe propose a simple new test to examine the statistical nature\nof the BCGs, and to supplement the classical tests proposed\nby Tremaine & Richstone (1977, TR).\nOur basic idea is to shuffle the cluster galaxies and see how\nlikely the observed LD of BCGs can be reproduced. The procedure is sketched in Fig. 1. Using a sample of 494 clusters\nfrom the C4 catalog at z = 0.03 \u2212 0.077, we combine all member galaxies with Mr \u2264 \u221220 to form a big pool of galaxies\n(5980 in total). We then randomly pick up galaxies from the\npool to create 494 mock clusters, whose total luminosities Ltot\nare matched to that of the real clusters as close as possible.\n\n\fStatistical Nature of BCGs\nThis way we can compare the correlation between the BCG\nluminosity Lbcg and Ltot of real and mock clusters (see Fig. 4).\nOf course, there are more than one way to create an ensemble\nof mock clusters, so we repeat this Monte Carlo process to\ngenerate 200 mock ensembles.\nThe averaged BCG luminosity from all 200 realizations\nof mock datasets, Lbcg,sim , gives the expected value when\nBCGs are statistical, as a function of cluster luminosity. The\ndifferences between the logarithms of mean mock BCG luminosity (Lbcg,sim ) from each ensemble and Lbcg,sim represent the degree of scatter expected if BCGs are stochastically selected from a global LD. In Fig. 5 we compare the\ndistribution of dsim = log Lbcg,sim \u2212 log Lbcg,sim with that of\ndobs = log Lbcg,obs \u2212 log Lbcg,sim , and find that the real BCGs\nare more luminous than the statistical expectation; there is\n0.8% of probability for dobs to be drawn from the same distribution of dsim (see Table 2). Separating the clusters into high\nand low luminosity subsamples (with a division luminosity\nof Ldiv = 3.7 \u00d7 1011h\u22122\n70 L\u2299 ), we conclude that the difference is\nmainly coming from BCGs in high luminosity clusters (only\n0.03% chance to be statistical). The luminosities of BCGs in\nlow luminosity clusters are roughly consistent with the global\nLD.\nWe extend the analysis to discuss the statistical nature of\nthe second brightest galaxies (G2s), and find strong evidence\nthat (in high luminosity clusters), G2s have a LD similar to\nthat of the whole cluster galaxy population.\nWe also apply the tests proposed by TR to our cluster sample, and record the results in Table 3. The two statistics (T1\nand T2 ) both suggest a small probability for BCGs to be statistical, consistent with our findings. However, examining the\nTR statistics for the high and low luminosity clusters reveals\nconfusing trends. According to the T1 statistic, BCGs in the\nhigh luminosity clusters are much less likely to be statistical\nthan their counterparts in the low luminosity clusters. However, the T2 statistic suggests the opposite conclusion.\nOur results confirm previous findings that BCGs in high\nluminosity clusters are a distinct population from other cluster\n\n11\n\ngalaxies and tentatively supports the physical mechanism of\ncannibalism (Ostriker & Tremaine 1975) which is essentially\ndynamical friction. We also suggest that BCGs are distinct\nfrom other non-BCG LRGs. As the majority of LRGs are the\nbrightest member in groups and clusters, such an effect should\nbe taken into account in selecting a homogeneous sample of\nLRGs for on-going and future BAO surveys.\nWe are grateful to Scott Tremaine and Bob Nichol for insightful comments on the manuscript.
