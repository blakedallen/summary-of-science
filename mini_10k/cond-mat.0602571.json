The evolution of this complex slow dynamics upon decreasing the temperature T or increasing the density \u03c1 has\nbeen documented for many systems for times t, which exceed the natural time scale tmic for condensed-matter motions\nby three or more orders of magnitude. Similar progress has\nbeen made for molecular-dynamics simulations of liquid models. In parallel to these experimental activities, a theory for\nthe evolution of glassy dynamics has been developed which\nis referred to as mode-coupling theory (MCT). This theory\nis based on regular equations of motion for a set of autocorrelation functions. The MCT equations lead to fold bifurcations for the correlators' long-time limits if some control\nparameter like T reaches a critical value Tc ; this bifurcation\ndescribes a transition from a liquid to an amorphous solid.\nThe distance of the control parameter from the critical value,\nsay \u03b5 = (Tc \u2212 T )/Tc , can be used for the discussion of the\nbifurcation dynamics as a small parameter. For \u03b5 tending to\nzero and times increasing to infinity, it is possible to calculate asymptotic solutions of the MCT equations. The leadingorder results provide a set of general formulas, which explain\nthe qualitative features of the bifurcation scenario. Many fits\nof data with these general formulas have been studied in order to test the relevance of the MCT for the explanation of the\nexperimental facts [1].\nA set of general MCT results, which is of main interest in\nthis paper, concerns the critical dynamics. This dynamics is\ndescribed by auto-correlation functions \u03c6(t) for control parameters at the bifurcation point, say T = Tc . Equivalently,\none can consider the corresponding loss spectra \u03c7\u2032\u2032 (\u03c9). These\nare the products of the frequency \u03c9 and the Fourier-cosine\ntransform of \u03c6(t). The central asymptotic formula is specified by (1) a positive number f c , which is called the plateau,\n(2) a positive amplitude, say A, and (3) the critical exponent a,\nobeying 0 < a < 0.396, limt\u2192\u221e t a [\u03c6(t)\u2212 f c ] = A. This formula\nis equivalent to lim\u03c9\u21920 \u03c7\u2032\u2032 (\u03c9)/\u03c9a = sin(\u03c0a/2)\u0393(1\u2212a)A, with\n\u0393 denoting the gamma function. For a given transition point,\n\nall correlators are specified by the same exponent a, but different critical points can differ in their value for a. The leadingorder long-time result for the correlator describes a powerlaw decay: \u03c6(t) \u2212 f c \u221d 1/t a . Equivalently, the leading-order\nresult for the low-frequency critical loss spectrum is given\nby a power law variation \u03c7\u2032\u2032 (\u03c9) \u221d \u03c9a . For states near the\ntransition point, \u03c6(t) and \u03c7\u2032\u2032 (\u03c9) can be replaced by their respective critical functions for short times, t \u226a t\u03c3 , or large\nfrequencies, \u03c9t\u03c3 \u226b 1. The time scale t\u03c3 is the same for all\ncorrelators and diverges for states approaching the transition\npoint. For t > t\u03c3 and \u03c9t\u03c3 6 1, the correlators and spectra depend sensitively on \u03b5; for shorter times, t \u226a t\u03c3 and \u03c9t\u03c3 \u226b 1,\nthe correlators and spectra depend on \u03b5 smoothly. An \u03c9a\nspectrum was identified first for the glass-forming molten salt\n0.4Ca(NO3 )2 0.6K(NO3 ) (CKN) in data obtained by neutronscattering spectroscopy [2]. This system was also used to\ndocument for the first time the evolution of glassy dynamics within the full Giga-Hertz band [3]: Using depolarized\nlight-scattering spectroscopy, a spectrum compatible with the\n\u03c9a law was found extending from 1GHz to 400GHz. The\nt \u2212a decay in the time domain was measured first for density\ncorrelators by photon-correlation spectroscopy for a colloidal\nsuspension of hard spheres [4] with the density as a control\nparameter.\nOther glass-forming systems that can be studied experimentally are found in many van-der Waals liquids. The natural time scale for inter-molecular vibrations is a picosecond. For normal liquid behavior, one expects correlations\nto decay to zero for times around some picoseconds. The\nnormal-liquid excitation spectra extend from, say, 0.5THz to,\nsay, 5THz. Glassy-dynamics spectra for several systems have\nbeen measured by depolarized light-scattering spectroscopy,\nand the data were shown to be consistent with the MCT bifurcation scenario. For example, spectra for toluene have been\nfitted successfully with leading-order asymptotic results for\nfrequencies between 0.5GHz and 1THz and for temperatures\ndecreasing from T = Tc + 140K to Tc + 10K; Tc \u2248 150K [5].\nFor all these systems, the weight of the glassy-dynamics part\nof the spectra is large compared to the part of normal-liquid\ndynamics, i.e., the so-called \u03b1-peak is large. In agreement\n\n\f2\nwith the MCT prediction for such situations, the amplitude A\nfor the \u03c9a spectrum is small, and the low-frequency contributions of the normal-liquid dynamics affect the region of the\nexpected \u03c9a behavior of the spectra. As a result, no frequency\ninterval has ever been identified for a van-der-Waals liquid,\nwhere an \u03c9a spectrum can be identified explicitly.\nTorre et. al [6] have introduced optical-Kerr-effect (OKE)\nspectroscopy as a technique for the study of glassy dynamics. The measurement provides the response function \u03c7(t) \u221d\n\u2212\u2202t \u03c6(t) for the same probing variable, which is studied in\ndepolarized light-scattering experiments. The Fourier-sine\ntransforms of \u03c7(t) are proportional to the loss spectra \u03c7\u2032\u2032 (\u03c9)\nmentioned in the preceding paragraph. The evolution of the\nglassy dynamics of m-toluidine was measured for temperatures decreasing from 295K to 250K. The response functions\ncould be fitted well by the scaling-law results predicted by the\nleading-order asymptotic formulas for the MCT bifurcation\n[7]. The analysis implies a critical temperature Tc near 220K\nand a critical exponent a near 0.3. However, lowering the temperature to 225K, the critical power-law decay \u03c7(t) \u221d 1/t 1+a\nwas not observed [8]. The negative slope of the measured\nlog \u03c7-versus-logt curve is not 1 + a, rather it is a number\n\u2032\nsmaller than unity, say 1 \u2212 b\u2032. Decay laws \u03c7(t) \u221d 1/t 1\u2212b with\nexponents b\u2032 around 0.2 have been identified by Cang et. al\n[9] for a number of other van-der-Waals liquids. The OKE\nresponse of salol was studied by Hinze et. al, and the data\nwere shown to be consistent with the known MCT scaling-law\nformulas for the temperature decreasing from 340K to 266K\n[10]. The glassy response for T = 257K was measured with\nan impressive accuracy for times increasing up to 0.5 \u03bcs; and\nthe dynamics for t > 100ps displays the behavior expected\nfrom the leading-order asymptotic results of MCT. However,\nthe glassy dynamics for 2ps < t < 20ps manifests itself by a\n\u03c7(t) \u221d 1/t decay. The corresponding correlator shows a logarithmic time dependence. All OKE response functions measured so far demonstrate a glassy dynamics that cannot be described by the general leading-order asymptotic formulas for\nthe MCT bifurcation in the regime t . 30ps. In a recent alternative approach [11] is was possible to fit some of the OKE\ndata for t > 30ps.\nIt was argued recently that the new facets of glassy dynamics discovered by OKE spectroscopy [8, 9, 10] can be understood as generic implications of the Cole-Cole law for the critical dynamics [12]. In the following, this statement shall be\nexplained in detail. Section II summarizes the equations of\nmotion and the known scaling-law results of MCT. It is explained in Sec. III that an asymptotic expansion of the modulus can have a much larger range of validity than the expansion for the susceptibility; the Cole-Cole law \u2013 introduced in\n1941 as empirical law [13] \u2013 is derived in full generality from\nthe microscopic equations of motion. The relevance of these\nresults is demonstrated for a schematic model in Sec. IV using parameter values that describe the mentioned OKE data.\nThe interplay between the Cole-Cole peak and the \u03b1-peak is\ninvestigated in Sec.V where for specific parameter values the\n\u03b1-peak displays a wing. Section VI presents a conclusion.\n\nII. ESSENTIAL MCT FORMULAS\nA.\n\nEquations of Motion\n\nWithin the basic version of MCT, the dynamics of the system is described by M correlators \u03c6q (t), q = 1, . . . , M. These\nare real and even functions of the time t, which obey the initial\nconditions \u03c6q (t = 0) = 1, \u2202t \u03c6q (t = 0) = 0. The corresponding\nset of normalized response functions is given by\n\u03c7q (t) = \u2212\u2202t \u03c6q (t) .\n\n(1a)\n\nLaplace transforms map functions from the time domain, say\nF(t), in the frequency domain.R They shall be used with\nthe convention LT[F(t)](z) = i 0\u221e dt exp[izt]F(t), z = \u03c9 +\ni0. One gets LT[\u03c7q (t)](z) = [1 + \u03c9\u03c6q (\u03c9)], where \u03c6q (\u03c9) =\nLT[\u03c6q (t)](z). The normalized dynamical susceptibilities are\ngiven by\n\u03c7q (\u03c9) = 1 + \u03c9\u03c6q(\u03c9) .\n\n(1b)\n\nThe loss spectra \u03c7\u2032\u2032q (\u03c9) = Im \u03c7q (\u03c9) are related trivially to the\nfluctuation spectra \u03c6\u2032\u2032q (\u03c9) = Im \u03c6q (\u03c9): \u03c7\u2032\u2032q (\u03c9) = \u03c9\u03c6\u2032\u2032q (\u03c9).\nThe Zwanzig-Mori formalism provides a fraction representation of \u03c6q (\u03c9) in terms of a fluctuating-force correlator Mq (\u03c9): \u03c6q (\u03c9) = \u22121/{\u03c9 \u2212 \u03a92q /[\u03c9 + Mq (\u03c9)]}. The positive frequency \u03a9q quantifies the initial decay of the correlator \u03c6q (t) = 1 \u2212 [\u03a9qt]2 /2 + O (t 3 ). Within MCT, a whitenoise term \u03bdq is split off from the kernel Mq (\u03c9); the remainder is represented in terms of a dimensionless function mq (t):\nMq (\u03c9) = i\u03bdq + \u03a92q mq (\u03c9); \u03bdq > 0. Here, mq (t) and mq (\u03c9) are\nrelated by Laplace-transformation. The fraction representation is equivalent to the equations of motion\n\u2202t2 \u03c6q (t)+\u03bdq \u2202t \u03c6q (t)\n\u0015\n\u0014\nZ t\n(2a)\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n2\ndt mq (t \u2212 t )\u2202t \u2032 \u03c6q (t ) = 0 .\n+\u03a9q \u03c6q (t) +\n0\n\nThe essential approximation in MCT is the expression of\nmq (t) as a polynomial Fq of the correlators:\nmq (t) = Fq [\u03c61 (t), . . . , \u03c6M (t)] .\n\n(2b)\n\nThere is no monomial contribution of order zero. The coefficients of the polynomial are called mode-coupling coefficients. They are the coupling constants of the theory and must\nnot be negative. Within the microscopic theory, the polynomials are of second order and the coefficients are given by\nthe equilibrium structure functions, which in turn are smooth\nfunctions of control parameters like the temperature T for the\nstates considered.\nAt the generic transition mentioned in the preceding section, the correlator's long-time limits depend singularly on\nthe distance parameter \u03b5. For \u03b5 < 0, fluctuations disappear\nfor long times, \u03c6q (t \u2192 \u221e) = 0. For \u03b5 > 0, \u03c6q (t \u2192 \u221e) = fq ,\n0 < fq < 1. q = 1, . . . , M; the fluctuations arrest. Within\n\n\f3\nthe microscopic version of MCT, the arrested part fq has the\nmeaning of the Debye-Waller factor of the solid amorphous\nstate. The leading-order variation with\n\u221a changes of \u03b5 for the\narrested part is given by fq \u2212 fqc \u221d \u03b5, \u03b5 \u2192 0+ , fqc > 0,\nq = 1, . . . , M. The regularity of the MCT equations implies the\nfollowing. For \u03b5 tending to arbitrarily small values, there appears an arbitrarily large time interval, where \u03c6q (t) is arbitrarily close to fqc . This critical arrested part fqc has the meaning\nof a plateau for the \u03c6q (t)-versus-logt curves for states near the\ntransition. The corresponding plateau for the force correlators\nis mq (t \u2192 \u221e) = fqm c = Fqc [ f1c , . . . , fMc ]. At the transition, \u03c6q (\u03c9)\nand mq (\u03c9) exhibit poles \u2212 fqc /\u03c9 and \u2212 fqm c /\u03c9, respectively.\nHence, there is a region of small |\u03b5| and small \u03c9, where \u03c9+i\u03bdq\ncan be neglected compared to \u03a92q mq (\u03c9). This region is the one\nfor the MCT glassy dynamics. The fraction representation of\nthe correlators simplifies to \u03c6q (\u03c9) = \u22121/[\u03c9 \u2212 1/mq(\u03c9)]. This\nformula can also be noted as\n\u03c9mq (\u03c9) = \u03c9\u03c6q (\u03c9)/ [1 + \u03c9\u03c6q(\u03c9)] .\n\n(3a)\n\nEquation (1b) yields the equivalent expression for the dynamical susceptibility:\n\u03c7q (\u03c9) = 1/ [1 \u2212 \u03c9mq(\u03c9)] .\n\n(3b)\n\nWithin the regime of glassy dynamics, [1 \u2212 \u03c9mq(\u03c9)] has the\nmeaning of a modulus for the response described by \u03c7q (t).\nThe pair of Eqs. (2b, 3a) can fix the solution only up to some\noverall time scale t0 . The latter is determined by matching of\nthe transient dynamics with the glassy dynamics. For further\ndetails and for a list of original papers, the reader can consult\nRef. [14].\n\nB. Scaling Laws\n\nThere is a straight-forward recipe to calculate from the coupling coefficients at the transition point and from the critical\narrested parts fqc a number \u03bb, 1/2 6 \u03bb < 1. It is called the exponent parameter for the chosen transition point of the model\nunder discussion. It fixes the critical exponent a, mentioned in\nSec. I. It fixes a further exponent b, 0 < b 6 1, which is called\nthe von Schweidler exponent. The equation for the two exponents reads \u0393(1 \u2212 a)2 /\u0393(1 \u2212 2a) = \u03bb = \u0393(1 + b)2 /\u0393(1 + 2b).\nParameter \u03bb also specifies a pair of equations for a pair of\nfunctions g\u00b1 (t\u02c6), which are defined for t\u02c6 > 0. The equations\nR\u02c6\nread \u00b11 + \u03bbg\u00b1 (t\u02c6)2 = (d/dt\u02c6) 0t dt\u02c6 g\u00b1 (t\u02c6 \u2212 t\u02c6\u2032 )g\u00b1 (t\u02c6\u2032 ), and they\nhave to be solved with the initial condition limt\u02c6\u21920 t\u02c6a g\u00b1 (t\u02c6) = 1.\nUp to corrections of order t\u02c6a , one gets for small t\u02c6:\ng\u00b1 (t\u02c6 \u226a 1) = 1/t\u02c6a .\n\n(4a)\n\nThe function g+ (t\u02c6) approaches\nits long-time limit exponen\u221a\ntially, g+ (t\u02c6 \u226b 1) = 1/ 1 \u2212 \u03bb. The function g\u2212 (t\u02c6) exhibits a\n\npower-law divergence for large t\u02c6. Up to corrections of order\n1/t\u02c6b, one gets\ng\u2212 (t\u02c6 \u226b 1) = \u2212Bt\u02c6b .\n\n(4b)\n\nThere are tables allowing the determination of a, b and B from\na given \u03bb. There are also tables to determine g\u00b1 (t\u02c6) with an\naccuracy sufficient for all practical purposes [15].\nThe functions g\u00b1 (t\u02c6) are the shape functions for the first\nscaling law of MCT. For \u03b5 tending to zero, there appears a time\ninterval of diverging length, within which \u2206q (t) = |\u03c6q (t) \u2212 fqc |\nis arbitrary small. The leading-order solution for the small\nparameter \u2206q (t) yields the first scaling-law. The solution assumes the form\n\u03c6q (t) = fqc + hq\n\np\n|\u03c3|g\u00b1 (t/t\u03c3 ) ,\n\n\u03b5 \u2277 0.\n\n(5a)\n\nThe amplitudes hq > 0, q = 1, . . . , M are calculated from the\nmode-coupling coefficients at the critical point. The separation parameter \u03c3 is defined similarly: it is a smooth function\nof the control parameters and can be linearized close to the\ntransition point, \u03c3 = C\u03b5 + O (\u03b52 ), with a positive coefficient C\nthat depends on the chosen control parameter. The first critical\ntime scale t\u03c3 is given by the critical exponent a, the separation\nparameter \u03c3, and the time scale t0 , which is defined by the\nshort-time dynamics:\nt\u03c3 = t0 /|\u03c3|\u03b4 ,\n\n\u03b4 = 1/(2a) .\n\n(5b)\n\nThe strong control-parameter dependence of the correlators\nnear the\np plateau is described solely by that of the correlation\nscale |\u03c3| and of the time scale t\u03c3 .\nFrom Eqs. (4a,5a,5b), one gets the leading-order asymptotic law for the decay of the critical correlator discussed in\nSec. I: \u03c6q (t) \u2212 fqc = hq (t0 /t)a . From Eqs. (4b, 5a, 5b) one gets\nthe von Schweidler law for the decay of the liquid correlators\nbelow the plateau:\n\u03c6q (t) = fqc + hq(t/t\u03c3\u2032 )b ,\n\nt\u03c3 \u226a t \u226a t\u03c3\u2032 ,\n\n\u03b5 < 0.\n\n(6)\n\nHere, the second critical time scale of MCT reads t\u03c3\u2032 =\nt0 /[B1/b|\u03c3|\u03b3 ], with \u03b3 = 1/(2a) + 1/(2b) . Up to errors of order |\u03b5|, the decay of the liquid correlators below the plateau is\ndescribed by the second scaling law of MCT\n\u03c6q (t) = \u03c6\u0303q (t/t\u03c3\u2032 ) ,\n\nt\u03c3\u2032 \u226a t ,\n\n\u03b5 < 0.\n\n(7)\n\nHere, \u03c6\u0303q (t \u0303) is an \u03b5-independent shape function. Its initial part\nis given by von Schweidler's law: \u03c6\u0303q (t \u0303 \u226a 1) = fqc \u2212 hqt \u0303b . Corp\nrections of order |\u03b5| modify the formula (7) for the belowplateau decay in a regime where \u03c6q (t) is close to the plateau.\nThese corrections are described by Eq. (5a) for t > t\u03c3 . The\nbelow-plateau decay is referred to as \u03b1-process, and Eq. (7)\nformulates the superposition principle. Details of the derivation of the cited results, references to the original work, and a\ncomprehensive demonstration for the hard-sphere system can\nbe found in Refs. [14, 16].\n\n\f4\nIII.\n\nB. Power-Law Solution for the Susceptibilities\n\nCRITICAL DYNAMICS AND COLE-COLE LAW\n\nIn this section, correlators and susceptibilities shall be discussed for states at the transition point, say T = Tc . Focusing\non the range of validity, the essential formulas are analyzed\nfor the correlators in III A, and for the susceptibilities in III B.\nThe Cole-Cole law is derived in III C.\n\nA.\n\nPower-Law Solution for Correlation Functions\n\nThe leading-order scaling-law formulas (4a,5a) yield for\nthe critical correlators\n\u03c6q (t) = fqc + hq(t0 /t)a .\n\n(8)\n\nA first question, whose answer is not implied by the results\ncited in Sec. II B, concerns the range of validity of Eq. (8) for\nshort times. Let us define an onset time tq\u2217 for the power law by\nthe request, that Eq. (8) describes \u03c6q (t) \u2212 fqc within a relative\nerror of, say, 10%, for t > tq\u2217 . For normal-liquid dynamics,\none would expect the correlators to decay to zero for times\naround tmic . A second question to be discussed is: How can\none describe the critical correlators in cases where tq\u2217 exceeds\ntmic , i.e., when there is a gap between the end of the transient\nregime and the onset of the critical power law?\nThe asymptotic solution (8) can be extended to an asymptotic series expansion in powers of t \u2212a . The result up to the\nnext-to-leading term shall be noted as\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u03c6q (t) = fqc + hq(t0 /t)a 1 + K\u0302q(t0 /t)a .\n\n(9a)\n\nHere, remainders which are given by (t0 /t)3a times some\npower of ln(t/t0 ) are dropped. The Tauberian theorem yields\nan equivalent formula in the frequency domain:\n\u03c9\u03c6q (\u03c9) = \u2212 fqc \u2212\u0393(1 \u2212 a)hq(\u2212i\u03c9t0 )a\n\n\u2212 \u0393(1 \u2212 2a)hqK\u0302q (\u2212i\u03c9t0 )2a .\n\n(9b)\n\nIn this formula, terms are dropped, which are proportional to\n\u03c93a times some power of ln \u03c9. The preceding two formulas are the starting point for the following derivations. It is\na straight-forward procedure to calculate the correction amplitude K\u0302q from the mode-coupling coefficients at the critical\npoint T = Tc [14]. From Eq. (9a), one can estimate an onset\n1\ntime of tq\u2217 /t0 = [10|K\u0302q |] a . This is an estimate based on the assumption that higher-order expansion terms in Eq. (9a) do not\ninfluence the results seriously for t > tq\u2217 . Typically for many\nsystems, the critical exponent a is around 0.3, and 1/a & 3.\nHence, tq\u2217 depends sensitively on the correction amplitude K\u0302q .\nAs a result, tq\u2217 can vary considerably for different q. As a relevant example, let us cite the results for the density-fluctuation\ncorrelators of a system of hard spheres of diameter d [14]:\nThe time t1\u2217 referring to a wave-number q1 d = 7.0 exceeds the\ntime t2\u2217 for q2 d = 10.6 by a factor of around 100.\n\nFrom Eqs. (1a, 8), one obtains the long-time result for the\nresponse functions up to leading-order corrections,\n\u03c7(t)t0 = ahq (t0 /t)1+a .\n\n(10)\n\nAccording to Eq. (9a), the leading order result in Eq. (8) is\nvalid for t > tq\u2217 , but the onset time for Eq. (10) is later, t >\ntq\u2217 21/a , where typically 21/a \u2248 10. Hence, the detection of\nthe critical dynamics in its leading asymptotic form is more\ndifficult for the response functions than for the correlators.\nFrom Eq. (9b), one arrives at the expansion formula for the\nabsorptive part of the dynamical susceptibility\n\u03c7\u2032\u2032q (\u03c9) = [\u0393(1 \u2212 a) sin (\u03c0a/2)]hq (\u03c9t0 )a\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u00d7 1 + kaK\u0302q (\u03c9t0 )a ,\nka = 2\u0393(1 \u2212 a) cos(\u03c0a/2)/\u03bb .\n\n(11a)\n\n(11b)\n\nThe leading-order power-law result reads\n\u03c7\u2032\u2032q (\u03c9) = [\u0393(1 \u2212 a) sin(\u03c0a/2)] hq (\u03c9t0 )a ,\n\n(11c)\n\n1/a\n\nwhich has an onset frequency of \u03c9\u2217q = 1/(tq\u2217 ka ); for \u03c9 6\n\u03c9\u2217q , the leading-order result in Eq. (11c) describes the critical\nspectrum with an error smaller than 10%. If \u03bb decreases from\n1 to 1/2, ka increases from 2 to near 5. For \u03bb near a typical\nvalue of 0.7, ka is above 3, and the onset frequency for the\n\u03c9a -law is about 30 times smaller than 1/tq\u2217 . Therefore, the\ndetection of the critical power-law in the loss spectra is even\nmore difficult then in the response function.\nIncluding the leading-correction terms in the asymptotic\nformulas, as noted in Eqs. (9a, 11a), is an obvious manner\nto extend the range of applicability of the analytic description\nof the dynamics. This is demonstrated comprehensively for\nthe MCT for the hard-sphere system in Refs. [14, 16]. But\nthere are cases, where this procedure does not lead to satisfactory results. The mean-squared displacement is an example,\nwhere the description of the increase towards the plateau by\nthe analog of Eq. (9a) cannot account for the glassy dynamics\n[16].\nC. The Cole-Cole Law\n\nEquation (9b) is an asymptotic expansion in terms of powers of the small quantity \u03be = (\u2212i\u03c9t0 )a that holds up to errors\nof \u03be3 . Substitution of this expansion into Eq. (3a) provides\nan analogous expansion for \u03c9mq (\u03c9). Let us indicate the nontrivial parts of the coefficients by a superscript m:\na\n\u2212\u03c9mq (\u03c9) = fqm c +\u0393(1 \u2212 a)hm\nq (\u2212i\u03c9t0 )\n\nm\n2a\n+ \u0393(1 \u2212 2a)hm\nq K\u0302q (\u2212i\u03c9t0 ) .\n\n(12)\n\n\f5\nComparing coefficients of equal powers of \u03be, one finds:\nfqm c = fqc /(1 \u2212 fqc) ,\nc 2\nhm\nq = hq /(1 \u2212 f q ) ,\n\nfqc = fqm c /(1 + fqm c ) .\n\nmc 2\nhq = hm\nq /(1 + f q ) .\n\nK\u0302qm = K\u0302q + \u03bb[hq/(1 \u2212 fqc )] ,\nK\u0302q =\n\nmc\nK\u0302qm \u2212 \u03bb[hm\nq /(1 + f q )] .\n\n(13a)\n\n(13b)\n\nIf the frequencies are so small that |K\u0302qcc (\u2212i\u03c9/\u03c9cq )| \u226a 1,\nEq.

The kernel mq (t = 0) can have any\npositive value. Therefore, in principle, fqm c can be any positive number. The different normalizations can be eliminated\nin the critical amplitudes by comparing the ratios hq / fqc and\nmc\nhm\nq / fq :\nmc\nc\nc\n[hm\nq / f q ] = [hq / f q ]/(1 \u2212 f q ) .\n\nh\n\u0001 i\n\u0001\nc 2a\ncc\nc a\n.

The three parameters specifying this formula can be\nexpressed in terms of the coefficients in Eq. (12) and, via\nEqs. (13), in terms of the coefficients specifying the correlamc\ntors in Eq. (9a). One gets \u03c7cc\n0 q = 1/(1 + f q ). This amplitude\nis the complement of the \u03b1-peak strength fqc of the normalized\nloss spectrum,\n(16a)\n\nThe characteristic frequency entering the new formula for the\u0001\nsusceptibility, is given by (\u03c9cqt0 )a = (1 + fqm c )/ hm\nq \u0393(1 \u2212 a)\nor by\n\u0002\n\u00031/a\n\u03c9cqt0 = (1 \u2212 fqc )/ (hq \u0393(1 \u2212 a))\n.\n\nThe condition of validity for this formula means that the\ncritical modulus can be described by the simple power\nlaw in the first line of Eq. (12). The modulus spectrum\nobeys a formula analog to Eq. (11c): \u03c9m\u2032\u2032q (\u03c9) = \u0393(1 \u2212\na\na) sin (\u03c0a/2)hm\nq (\u03c9t0 ) . Using the 10% criterion from above,\nthe last term in Eq. (12) can be dropped for frequencies\n\u0002\n\u0001\u00031/a\n\u03c9t0 6 \u03bb/ 10\u0393(1 \u2212 a)|K\u0302qm|\n. The correlator corresponding to the loss spectrum in Eq. (17) is given by the Mittagn\nLeffler function of index a: Ma (x) = \u2211\u221e\nn=0 x /\u0393(1 + na),\n\n(14)\n\nThese ratios determine the relative amplitude of the dynamics\naround the plateau within the first scaling-law\np regime. Equation (5a) yields (\u03c6q (t) \u2212 fqc )/ fqc = [hq / fqc ] |\u03c3|g\u00b1 (t/t\u03c3 ), and\na corresponding identity holds for mq (t). From Eq. (14) one\nconcludes that the relative amplitude of the first-scaling-law\ncontribution is larger by 1/(1 \u2212 fqc ) > 1 for the modulus than\nfor the susceptibility; and 1/(1 \u2212 fqc ) increases with fqc , the \u03b1peak contribution of the loss spectrum. Consequently, within\nthe range of validity of the first scaling law, it is easier to measure the first-scaling-law contribution for the modulus than\nthat for the susceptibility.\nThe expansion (12) can be substituted into Eq. (3b) in order to obtain an asymptotic expansion for the inverse of the\ncritical susceptibility, i.e., for the modulus. The result shall be\nnoted in the form\n\nc\n\u03c7cc\n0 q = 1 \u2212 fq .\n\nThe correction amplitude reads K\u0302qcc = K\u0302qm (1 + fqm c )/(\u03bbhm\nq ),\nwhich is equivalent to\n\u0003\n\u0002\n(16c)\nK\u0302qcc = 1 + (1 \u2212 fqc )/hq K\u0302q /\u03bb .\n\n(16b)\n\nThe Mittag-Leffler function can be calculated efficiently by\nFourier-back transformation of \u03c7\u2032\u2032q (\u03c9)/\u03c9.\nEquation (17) describes a very broad peak for the loss spectrum \u03c7\u2032\u2032q (\u03c9) with a maximum located at \u03c9 = \u03c9cq . The spectrum\nis invariant under the interchange of (\u03c9/\u03c9cq ) to (\u03c9cq /\u03c9): the\n\u03c7\u2032\u2032q (\u03c9)-versus-log\u03c9 curve is symmetric. The width of the peak\nincreases strongly with decreasing exponent a. For a \u2248 0.3, \u03c9\nhas to increase by more than a factor of 104 in order to scan\nthe interval of frequency where \u03c7\u2032\u2032q (\u03c9) > \u03c7\u2032\u2032q (\u03c9cq )/2. This susceptibility formula known as Cole-Cole law, Eq. (17), was introduced as an empirical formula for dielectric loss spectra in\nglassy systems [13]. In particular, broad peaks located above\nthe \u03b1 peaks \u2013 often called \u03b2-peaks in this context \u2013 have been\nfitted by it.\nThe Cole-Cole formula, Eq. (17), exhibits simple limits for\nsmall and large frequencies. For (\u03c9/\u03c9cq )a \u226a 1, the Cole-Cole\nsusceptibility reproduces the general power-law for the loss\nspectrum, Eq. (11c), \u03c7\u2032\u2032q (\u03c9) \u221d \u03c9a . Similarly, the corresponding Mittag-Leffler correlator reproduces the general long-time\nasymptote for the response, Eq. (10). For (\u03c9/\u03c9cq )a \u226b 1, the\nCole-Cole spectrum describes a critical spectrum which decreases with increasing frequency: \u03c7\u2032\u2032q (\u03c9) \u221d 1/\u03c9a . This is\nsimilar to a von Schweidler-law spectrum. The corresponding Mittag-Leffler correlator decreases according to the law\n\u03c6(t) \u2212 const. \u221d \u2212t a . This yields a response function \u03c7(t) \u221d\n1/t x with x = 1 \u2212 a < 1. Such behavior is consistent with the\none detected by the OKE results for van-der Waals liquids [9].\nThe crossover of the critical spectrum from the lowfrequency wing to the high-frequency wing of the ColeCole loss peak has a counterpart for the Mittag-Leffler correlator that is most easily seen in a semilogarithmic plot.\nFor (t\u03c9cq )a \u226a 1, the [\u03c6(t) \u2212 const.]-versus-logt curve is bent\ndownward, as known for the von Schweidler curves. For\n(t\u03c9cq )a \u226b 1, there is the critical power-law decay which shows\n\n\f6\nup as an upward-bent curve. Hence, the \u03c6(t)-versus-logt\ncurve exhibits an inflection point. For an exponent a around\n0.3, the curve is nearly straight for an increase of log10 t by\na factor of about 3. In this case, there is nearly-logarithmic\ndecay of the critical correlator for a time variation over three\norders of magnitude.\nIt depends on the size of 1/\u03c9cq relative to the microscopic\ntime scale tmic which part of the Mittag-Leffler correlator\ndominates the critical dynamics in the time range of interest. The crucial question concerns the range of validity of\nthe leading-order result for the susceptibility and for the modulus. These ranges are determined by the correction amplitudes. If |K\u0302q | is large and |K\u0302qm | small, the Cole-Cole formula has a larger range of applicability than the general simple power-law formula (11c). But, if |K\u0302qm | is larger than |K\u0302q |,\nEq. (11c) is a better approximation for the critical decay than\nthe Cole-Cole spectrum. Since the brackets in Eqs. (13) are\npositive, there are two obvious results. If K\u0302q is positive, there\nholds K\u0302qm > K\u0302q . In this case, the leading-order result for the\nsusceptibility is a better description of the critical spectrum\nthan the Cole-Cole spectrum. If K\u0302qm is negative, there holds\n|K\u0302qm | < |K\u0302q | and the application of the Cole-Cole law is superior to the one of the general leading-order result for the\nloss spectrum. For negative correction amplitudes K\u0302q , there\nis a trend for cancellation of the two contributions to K\u0302qm in\nEq. (13c). It is a generic situation, that |K\u0302qm | is smaller than\n|K\u0302q |. Hence, for K\u0302q < 0, it is expected that the Cole-Cole law\nis a good description of the critical dynamics.\nA detailed discussion of the MCT equations has shown that\na large arrested part fqc implies a large negative correction amplitude K\u0302q for the critical decay [14]. In this case, the onset\ntime tq\u2217 may exceed the microscopic time scale tmic by several\norders of magnitude. The time range for the applicability of\nthe leading-order asymptotic description of the critical decay\nmay be outside the accessible range of the existing spectrometers. But, this is the situation, where |K\u0302qm | may be so small that\nthe Cole-Cole law or the Mittag-Leffler correlator can provide\nan adequate description of the critical dynamics.\n\nIV.\n\nAPPLICATION TO SCHEMATIC MODELS\n\nThe preceding results shall be demonstrated in a simple\nschematic model for two different cases where the model parameters are adjusted to reproduce the data measured for benzophenone (BZP) and salol [9, 10, 12]\nThe simplest MCT models deal with a single correlation\nfunction only. For these models, the formulas in the preceding sections simplify since the label q can be dropped. The\ncorrelator, the critical arrested part, and the critical amplitude\nshall be denoted by \u03c6(t), f c , and h, respectively. The model\nis specified by the frequency \u03a9 and the friction coefficient \u03bd\nin the equation of motion (2a). Furthermore, there are the\nnon-negative coefficients vl , l > 1, which specify the modecoupling monomial of order l for F in Eq. (2b). In applications for data descriptions, the specified numbers are considered as smooth functions of the physical control parameters.\n\nThe simplest model for the polynomial F , which can reproduce all possible values for the exponent parameter \u03bb, is given\nby the following formula for the fluctuating-force kernel\nm(t) = v1 \u03c6(t) + v2\u03c6(t)2 .\n\n(19)\n\nThe two coupling constants v1 and v2 specify the state of the\nsystem by a point in the first quadrant of the v1 -v2 plane, cf.\nlower inset in Figs. 1 and 4. The points (vc1 , vc2 ) for generic\nfold bifurcations are located on a piece of a parabola. The\nposition of the specific transition point can be characterized\nby the value for \u03bb [17]:\nvc1 = (2\u03bb \u2212 1)/\u03bb2 , vc2 = 1/\u03bb2 , f c = 1 \u2212 \u03bb , h = \u03bb .\n\n(20a)\n\nThe separation of some point (v1 , v2 ) from the transition point\n(vc1 , vc2 ), see upper insets Figs. 1 and 4, is given by\n\u03c3 = [v\u03021 + v\u03022 (1 \u2212 \u03bb)]\u03bb(1 \u2212 \u03bb) ,\n\nv\u03021, 2 = v1, 2 \u2212 vc1, 2 .\n\n(20b)\n\nThe arrested part of the correlator for the glass state reads\n\u03c6(t \u2192 \u221e) = h[\u03c3/(1 \u2212 \u03bb)]1/2 + O (\u03c33/2). The splitting of this\nvalue in an amplitude h and a remainder is not unique. The\ncited value for the critical amplitude h follows the conventions\nmade in the preceding literature [14]. The general expression\nfor the correction amplitude K\u0302 for M = 1 models [18] is specialized easily to K\u0302 = \u03ba(x), where the functions \u03ba(x) is defined\nby\n1\n\u03ba(x) = \u0393(1 \u2212 x)3 / [\u03bb\u0393(1 \u2212 3x) \u2212 \u0393(1 \u2212 x)\u0393(1 \u2212 2x)] . (21)\n2\nFunction \u03ba(x) increases monotonically with increasing \u03bb:\nit decreases with increasing x. For \u03bb = 1/2, i.e., for a =\n0.395 . . ., one gets \u03ba(a) = \u22120.169 . . . . For \u03bb approaching 1,\na tends to zero and \u03ba(a) diverges. For a = 1/3, \u03bb = 0.684 . . .,\nthe correction amplitude vanishes. All higher-order corrections for the critical decay outside the transient regime vanish as well for this special value of \u03bb [19]. Therefore, for \u03bb\nnear 0.7, the simple power-law formulas of the leading-order\nasymptotic-expansion theory like Eqs. (8, 10, 11c) describe\nthe critical dynamics very well.\nFor the specified model, there holds f c 6 1/2. Hence, this\nmodel cannot be used to describe glassy-dynamics data for\nsystems where the \u03b1-peak loss spectra have a weight f c which\nexceeds 50% of the total weight. Moreover, the relation between the exponent parameter \u03bb and the critical arrested part\nf c , as formulated by Eq. (20a), is an artifact of the model. The\nminimum requirement for a schematic model for data analysis is the freedom to adjust \u03bb and f c independently. This goal\ncan be achieved by introducing a second correlator. The first\ncorrelator \u03c6q=1 (t) = \u03c6(t) is used as a caricature of the densityfluctuation dynamics. It provides the exponent parameter. The\nsecond one describes the dynamics of some probing variable,\nsay, A. The correlator shall be denoted by \u03c6q=2 (t) = \u03c6A (t). All\nquantities referring to this correlator shall be indicated by an\nindex A. The equation of motion (2a) is specified by \u03a9A > 0,\n\n\f7\n\u03bdA > 0, and a kernel mA (t). The two frequencies quantify the\ntransient dynamics. The kernel is a polynomial (2b) of the\ntwo correlators involved. The simplest model describing the\ncoupling of the probing variable to the density-fluctuation is\ngiven by [20]\n(22)\n\nThe coupling of the probing variable to the density fluctuations is quantified by vA > 0. Since there is no influence of\nthe dynamics of the probing variable on the density dynamics,\nthe same scaling-law function g\u00b1 (t/t\u03c3 ), Eq. (5a), describes\nthe leading-order near-plateau dynamics of \u03c6A (t) as it does\nfor that of \u03c6(t). Notice in particular that the parameters \u03a9A ,\n\u03bdA , and vA do not modify the time scale t0 . In applications for\ndata descriptions, the model parameters \u03a9A , \u03bdA , and vA are\nto be considered as smooth functions of the physical control\nparameters, cf. lower insets in Figs. 1 and 4.\nThe loss spectrum \u03c7\u2032\u2032A (\u03c9) develops a \u03b2-peak upon increasing the mode-coupling coefficient vA [21]. For this special case and in the limit of infinite vA , the Cole-Cole susceptibility and the Mittag-Leffler correlator have been derived for the critical dynamics of the probing variable in Ref.\n[18]. The model specified by Eqs. (19, 22) was used repeatedly for the description of experimental data [12, 22,\n23, 24, 25, 26]. Large data sets for the evolution of the\nglassy dynamics of propylene carbonate have been analyzed\nin Ref. [27]; results measured for different probing variables A\nobtained by neutron-scattering, depolarized-light-scattering,\nand dielectric-loss spectroscopy have been fitted by a common first correlator \u03c6(t). The different probes have been characterized by adjusting the parameters for the second correlator\n\u03c6A (t) only.\nUp to order (t0 /t)2a , the kernel mA (t) can be calculated\nfrom Eq. (22) substituting the expression (9a) for \u03c6(t) and the\nanalog expression for the second correlator,\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u03c6A (t) = fAc + ha(t0 /t)a 1 + K\u0302A(t0 /t)a .\n\n(23)\n\nLaplace transform yields \u03c9mA (\u03c9) as an asymptotic power series in the small parameter \u03be = (\u2212i\u03c9t0 )a . The coefficients are\nlinear functions of fAc , hA , and K\u0302A . This is substituted on the\nleft-hand side of Eq. (3a) for q = 2. Expanding the right-hand\nside up to orders \u03be2 , one can compare the coefficients in order\nto arrive at:\nfAc = 1 \u2212 [1/( f c vA )] ,\n\n\u0001\nhA = \u03bb/ f c 2 vA .\n\n(24)\n\nThe correction amplitude shall be noted in the convention\nof the general theory [14]:\nK\u0302A = \u03ba(a) + KA ,\n\nKA = \u03bbva\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n1\n\u2212 \u03bb / [vA (1 \u2212 \u03bb) \u2212 1] .\nvA (1 \u2212 \u03bb)\n\n(25a)\n\n(25b)\n\n-0.05\n-0.10\n\n-2\nlog10\u03c7A(t)\n\nmA (t) = vA \u03c6(t)\u03c6A (t) .\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n\u03c3\n240 260 280 300 320\nT[K]\n\n-3\n\n-4\n\n30\n20\n10\n\nvA\nv1\n\n0.8\n0.6\n1\n\n-5\n\nsc\nsc\n\n2\n\n1.5\n\n0\n\n1\n\nv2\n\n2\n3\nlog10t[ps]\n\n4\n\nFIG. 1: OKE response functions measured for BZP for T /K =\n251, 260, 290, 320 [9] (full lines from bottom to top) and fits by the\nschematic-model functions \u03c7A (t) [12] (dotted lines). The straight\ndashed line has slope \u22120.80. The dash-dotted lines labeled sc are\nthe approximations by the scaling functions Eq. (28), the thin dashed\nlines are fits with Eq.

The insets\nshow the separation parameter \u03c3 (right) and the fitting parameters\n(left); two additional state points (+ and \u00d7) indicate extrapolations\nfor which solutions are shown in Fig. 7.\n\nThis leads to the parameters for the Cole-Cole susceptibility:\nc\n\u03c7cc\n0 A = 1/ ( f vA ) ,\n\n\u03c9cAt0 = [(1 \u2212 \u03bb)/ (\u03bb\u0393(1 \u2212 a))]1/a . (26)\n\nRemarkably, the comparison of Eq. (26) with the general expression in Eq. (16b) shows, that the Cole-Cole frequency\n\u03c9cA does not depend on the coupling coefficient vA . \u03c9cAt0 decreases with increasing \u03bb from 0.37. . . for \u03bb = 1/2 to about\n10\u22124 for \u03bb near 0.88. For \u03bb around 0.7, \u03c9cAt0 is about 0.02.\n\nA. Critical Relaxation for a Small Cole-Cole Frequency\n\nFigure 1 reproduces OKE-response functions measured for\nbenzophenone (BZP) [9] and fits to these data by the response\n\u03c7A (t) calculated for the model defined in the preceding section. The fit parameters for the mode-coupling coefficients\nv1 , v2 , and vA are specified in the lower inset. The analysis\nshall be done by anticipating a transition point for \u03bb = 0.70,\nwhich implies the exponents a = 0.33 and b = 0.64. The cross\nin the inset is close to this bifurcation point. The \u03c3-versusT diagram is shown in the upper inset; and extrapolation to\n\u03c3 = 0 suggests the critical temperature Tc = 235K with an estimated uncertainty of \u00b15K. The 251K result exhibits the expected von Schweidler decay, log \u03c7(t) = const. \u2212 (1 \u2212 b) logt\nfor times between about 0.3ns and about 6ns. Further details\ncan be inferred from Ref.

The dashed line marked\nvS shows a von Schweidler law, Eq. (6), with b = 0.64 and a time\nscale adjusted to match the T = 251K curve. The dashed line labeled\nK is a fit by the Kohlrausch law, \u03c6A (t) = fAc exp[\u2212(t/\u03c4)\u03b2 ], \u03b2 = 0.91,\nwith \u03c4 adjusted to match the T = 260K curve. The times t0 and\n1/\u03c9cA = 15ps are indicated by arrows. The upper panel shows the\ncritical decay (c) together with the leading-order (t \u2212a ) and next-toleading-order (t \u22122a ) asymptotic power-law solution, Eq. (9a). The\ndotted curve labeled cc displays the leading-order Cole-Cole solution, Eq. (18), with \u03c7cc\n0 = 1/9. The points of 10% deviation of the\napproximations t \u2212a , t \u22122a , and cc from the critical decay are indicated\nby the diamond, circle, and triangle, respectively.\n\nThe MCT results describe the measured evolution of the\nglassy dynamics adequately for times exceeding tmic = 1ps\nwith two exceptions. The T = 251K data exhibit a pronounced\noscillation near 1.1ps, while the calculated curve shows this\noscillation near 0.9ps. Furthermore, there are some deviations\nbetween the theoretical results and the data for the T = 260K\nresults for times around 10ns. The four correlators \u03c6A (t) and\nthe four loss spectra \u03c7\u2032\u2032A (t), which are shown in the lower\npanels of Figs. 2 and 3, respectively, are the MCT results\ncorresponding to the MCT responses \u03c7A (t) shown in Fig. 1.\nThe data fits have been calculated for fixed relative values of\n\n-5\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n-1\n\nlog10\u03c9[ps ]\nFIG. 3: Spectra for BZP.

The points\nof 10% deviation of the approximations \u03c9\u2212a , \u03c9\u22122a , and cc from\nthe critical spectrum are indicated by the diamond, circle, and triangle, respectively. The frequencies \u03c9cA and \u03bd = \u03c9/(2\u03c0) = 1THz are\nmarked by arrows.\n\nthe four frequencies, which specify the transient dynamics:\n\u03a9A = \u03a9, \u03bdA = \u03bd = 5\u03a9. The scale \u03a9 for the fits is chosen different for different temperatures T [12]. The curves in Fig. 2\nand 3 are presented with a T -independent scale corresponding\nto that one used for the fit for T = 251K: \u03a9 = 1.67ps\u22121. With\nthe mentioned reservations, these curves can be considered as\nthe measured quantities for the OKE-probing variable A. The\nfull lines marked c in Figs. 2 and 3 show the critical correlator\n\u03c6cA (t) and the critical loss spectrum \u03c7\u2032\u2032A c (\u03c9), respectively, for\nthe transition point specified by \u03bb = 0.70 and vA = 30. The\ncorrelator relaxes to the plateau fAc = 8/9 with a critical amplitude hA = 7/27.\nThe second scaling law for the decay below the plateau of\nthe correlators, Eq. (7), implies a corresponding scaling law\n\n\f9\nfor the response:\n\u03c7A (t) = \u03c7\u0303A (t/t\u03c3\u2032 )/t\u03c3\u2032 .\n\n(27)\n\nThe control-parameter independent shape function reads\n\u03c7\u0303A (t \u0303) = \u2212\u2202\u03c6\u0303A (t \u0303)/\u2202t \u0303. The reader can check this superposition\nprinciple for the results in Fig. 1 as follows. The log \u03c7A (t)versus-logt curve for T = 320K and t > 2ps can be translated\nso that it collapses with the curves for T /K = 290, 260, and\n251 for times exceeding 4ps, 90ps, and 290ps, respectively.\nEquivalently, the four loss spectra in Fig. 3 for \u03c7\u2032\u2032A (\u03c9) > 0.1 are\nconnected by the superposition principle: \u03c7\u2032\u2032A (\u03c9) = \u03c7\u0303\u2032\u2032A (\u03c9t\u03c3\u2032 ).\nThe von Schweidler law describes a part of the high-frequency\nwing of the loss peak as shown by the straight dashed line\nwith label vS for the T = 251K curve. The Kohlrausch law\nfor a stretching exponent \u03b2 = 0.91 describes the upper part of\nthe \u03b1-peak as shown by the dashed line with label K for the\nT = 260K result.\nThere is an interval of times between the end of the transient dynamics and the start of the von Schweidler decays\nthat deals with the relaxation towards and through the plateau\nfAc . The dynamics causes the loss spectra for \u03c7\u2032\u2032A (\u03c9) 6 0.1 and\n\u03c9/(2\u03c0) < 0.1THz shown in Fig. 3. The leading-order asymptotic solution of the MCT equations of motion deals with this\npart of the dynamics together with the von Schweidler-law\npart by Eq. (5a). This formula yields the first scaling law for\nthe response\n\u03c7A (t) = hA s\u03c3 \u03c7\u0302(t/t\u03c3 ) ;\n\ns\u03c3 =\n\np\n|\u03c3|/t\u03c3 .\n\n(28)\n\nThe shape function reads \u03c7\u0302(t\u02c6) = \u2212\u2202g\u00b1 (t\u02c6)/\u2202t\u02c6, T \u2277 Tc . For\nT > Tc , Eq. (4b) yields the von Schweidler response for large\nrescaled times t\u02c6 = t/t\u03c3 : \u03c7\u0302(t\u02c6 \u226b 1) = B * b/t\u02c6x , x = 1 \u2212 b <\n1. For small rescaled times, Eq. (4a) yields \u03c7\u0302(t\u02c6 \u226a 1) =\na/t\u02c6x , x = 1 + a > 1. The crossover from one asymptote to\nthe other occurs for times near t\u03c3 . The light dashed lines in\nFig. 1 exhibit fits of the data by Eq. (28) for \u03bb = 0.70. However, both scales s\u03c3 and t\u03c3 are adjusted with the aim to achieve\na good match in the von Schweidler-law regime. The 1/t 1+alaw is not exhibited by the results in Fig. 1. For T = 320K,\nthe crossover time t\u03c3 is located near 1ps, i.e., it is within or\nclose to the transient regime. For the other three temperatures\nand times within the interval tmic < t < t\u03c3 , the measured response and the calculated functions \u03c7A (t) are below the values\nof hA s\u03c3 \u03c7\u0302(t/t\u03c3 ).\nThe straight dashed line in Fig. 1 has a slope of \u22120.80. It\ndemonstrates a pseudo-von Schweidler decay of the T = 251K\n\u2032\nresults for 2ps < t < 20ps: \u03c6A (t) \u2212 const. \u221d \u2212t b , b\u2032 = 0.20.\nThe \u03c6A (t)-versus-logt curves in Fig. 2 for t > 2ps approach\nand cross the plateau as downward-bent curves before entering the von Schweidler decay regime. There are no inflection points of the curves for some time near t\u03c3 , as implied by\nEq. (5a).\nThe first scaling law describes a loss minimum of some\nvalue \u03c7min at some position \u03c9min . The shape of the log \u03c7\u2032\u2032A (\u03c9)versus-log\u03c9 curves is independent of the separation paramep\nter \u03c3 and the scales fix the position of the curve: \u03c7min \u221d |\u03c3|,\n\n\u03c9min \u221d 1/t\u03c3 . The minimum is due to the crossover from the\nvon Schweidler wing of the \u03b1-peak, \u03c7\u2032\u2032 (\u03c9) \u221d 1/\u03c9b , to the\npower-law asymptote for the critical dynamics, \u03c7\u2032\u2032 (\u03c9) \u221d \u03c9a .\nFor most practical purposes, the minimum can be approximated by the interpolation formula [28]:\ni\nh\n\u03c7\u2032\u2032A (\u03c9)/\u03c7min = b (\u03c9/\u03c9min )a + a (\u03c9min /\u03c9)b /(a + b) . (29)\nHowever, the loss spectra in the lower panel of Fig, 3 do not\nexhibit loss minima, which can be described by the interpolation formula for the leading-order asymptotic result. The\nminima for frequencies \u03c9 near 1ps\u22121 do not depend sensitively on \u03c3. With decreasing |\u03c3|, the minimum position even\nshifts slightly upwards rather than downwards. With increasing frequency, the high-frequency part of the \u03b1-peak exhibits a\ncrossover from the von Schweidler decay, \u03c7\u2032\u2032 (\u03c9) \u221d 1/\u03c9b, to a\n\u2032\npseudo von Schweidler decay, \u03c7\u2032\u2032 (\u03c9) \u221d 1/\u03c9b . For T = 251K,\nthis high-frequency wing extends from \u03c9 \u2248 0.02ps\u22121 to about\n0.4ps\u22121 with b\u2032 = 0.2, as is demonstrated by the dashed\nstraight line. The observed minimum is due to the crossover\n\u2032\nfrom the 1/\u03c9b wing to the spectral peak for the normal-liquid\ndynamics. The latter is located near \u03bd = 1THz.\nThe scaling-law fits, which are shown in Fig. 1 by the light\ndashed lines, are misleading because the scales s\u03c3 and t\u03c3 have\nbeen adjusted freely. Calculating these scales from Eqs. (5b,\n20b, 24), one obtains for T = 251K and 260K the dash-dotted\nlines marked by sc. The two distance parameters \u03b5 = (Tc \u2212\nT )/Tc are -0.07 and -0.11, respectively. These values are too\nlarge for a leading-order asymptotic formula to be applicable.\nThe correlator \u03c6A (t) for the lowest temperature under discussion is close to the critical one for t up to about 30ps, as\nis shown in the lower panel of Fig. 2. Hence, the T = 251K\ncurves exhibit critical glassy dynamics for the times between\n1ps and 30ps. From Eqs. (25) one obtains the correction amplitude K\u0302A = \u22121.51. This large value yields an onset time\ntA\u2217 for the t \u2212a -law which is beyond t = 103 ps as is marked\nby the diamond in the upper panel of the figure. Including\nthe leading correction term yields the approximation by the\ndashed line denoted t \u22122a . It improves the description of the\ncritical decay so that it can be understood for times larger than\nabout t = 30ps. But the expansion formula (23) cannot be used\nto describe that part of the critical decay, which is measured\nfor BZP and described by the solution of the two-component\nschematic MCT model.\nSubstituting the cited values for \u03bb, fAc , and hA into Eqs. (13a,\n13b), one gets the plateau for the modulus, fAm c = 8, and the\ncritical amplitude hm\nA = 21. Notice that the relative strength of\nthe first scaling law amplitude for the modulus is much larger\nmc\nc\nthan that for the correlator: hm\nA / f A = 2.6 versus hA / f A =\n0.29. From Eq. (13c), one obtains the correction amplitude\nK\u0302Am = 0.124. As expected from the discussions of Sec. III, the\nonset time tAm \u2217 for the leading-order formula for the modulus,\nmA (t) = fAm c + hA (t0 /t)a ,\n\n(30a)\n\nis smaller than tA\u2217 by more than a factor 1000. As a result, see\nthe upper panel of Fig. 2, the equivalent formula (18) for the\n\n\f10\n\n0\n\ncorrelator,\n\n-1\n(30b)\n\ndescribes the probing variable A for all times exceeding t =\n1ps. The leading-order asymptotic result for the modulus explains the response for T = 251K quantitatively within the\ninterval 1ps6 t 6 30ps.\nFigure 3 shows that the leading-asymptotic description of\nthe critical loss spectrum, Eq. (11c), would be relevant for the\nexplanation of the loss minimum only in cases with \u03c9min <\n2 * 10\u22125 ps\u22121 . The dashed line labeled \u03c92a exhibits the asymptotic expansion for the critical loss up to the leading correction, Eq. (11a). This formula is relevant for \u03c9 < 10\u22123ps\u22121 .\nEven this expression is unsatisfactory for the discussion of the\nBZP results because of the large correction amplitude. However, the Cole-Cole spectrum describes the critical loss reasonably for \u03c9 < 0.2ps\u22121. The correction amplitude for the\nCole-Cole law, Eq. (16c) is very small, K\u0302Acc = 0.076. The\nCole-Cole law with leading correction, Eq. (15), is shown\nin the upper panel of Fig. 3 by the curve marked ccc, and it\nslightly above the leading-order result in the regime of large\nfrequencies.\nFor the system under study, the Cole-Cole frequency reads\n\u03c9cA = 0.067ps\u22121. This frequency \u03c9cA /(2\u03c0) \u2248 10GHz is small\ncompared to the 1THz scale for the normal-liquid dynamics. The value \u2212 log \u03c9cA is in the center of the logt interval\nstudied by the results of Fig. 1. Therefore, the critical spectrum relevant for the understanding of the data differs qualitatively from the leading-order power-law formula. As a result, the loss minima in Fig. 3, which are caused by the superposition of the critical spectra for \u03c9 near and above \u03c9cA\nand the von Schweidler-law wing of the \u03b1-peak, differ drastically from the general low-frequency shape described by\nEq. (29). For T = 251K, the superposition yields the pseudovon Schweidler law manifested as a wing specified by the\nexponent b\u2032 = 0.20. This wing will be analyzed further in\nSec. V.\nB. Critical Relaxation for an Intermediate Cole-Cole\nFrequency\n\nFive OKE response functions measured for salol [10] and\nfits by the functions \u03c7A (t) of the above explained schematic\nmodel are reproduced in Fig. 4. The filled dots in the insets\nspecify the mode-coupling coefficients v1 , v2 , and vA used for\nthe calculations. Further details can be found in Ref. [12],\nwhere, however, the value for \u03a9 was misprinted. The series of states (v1 , v2 ) extrapolates to a transition point with\n\u03bb = 0.73, which implies a critical exponent a = 0.31 and a\nvon Schweidler exponent b = 0.59. The extrapolation of the\n\u03c3-versus-T parameters to \u03c3 = 0 suggests a critical temperature\nTc = 245K with an estimated uncertainty of \u00b13K. The MCT\ncorrelators \u03c6A (t) and loss spectra \u03c7\u2032\u2032A (\u03c9), which are equivalent\nto the response \u03c7A (t) in Fig. 4, are shown in the lower panels of Figs. 5 and 6, respectively. They can be considered as\nthe measured results for the glassy dynamics of salol, since\n\n-0.01\n\nt0\n\n-0.02\n\n-2\nlog10\u03c7A(t)\n\n\u03c6A (t) = fAc + (1 \u2212 fAc )Ma [\u2212 (t\u03c9cA )a ] ,\n\n0\n\u03c3\n\n240 260 280 300 320 340\nT[K]\n\n-3\n60\n\nvA\n\n-4 30\n-5 0.9 v1\n\nsc\n\n-6 0.8\n1.6\n\n-7\n\n-2\n\n1.8\n\n-1\n\n2 v2\n\n0\n\nsc\n1\n2\nlog10t[ps]\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nFIG. 4: OKE-response functions measured for salol for T /K =\n247, 257, 270, 300, 340 (full lines from bottom to top) [10]. The\ndotted lines are fits by the schematic-model response \u03c7A (t) calculated with \u03a9 = 2\u03a9A = 10\u03bdA = 15.9ps\u22121 [12]. Symbols and curve\nstyles are the same as in Fig. 1. The slope of the straight dashed line\nis \u22121.15.\n\nthe calculated and measured curves in Fig. 4 agree outside\nthe transient regime. This holds with the reservation, that fits\nand measurements for the T = 270K results exhibit some discrepancies for times exceeding 20ns. The lines with label c in\nFigs. 5 and 6 show critical correlators and critical loss spectra,\nrespectively, calculated for \u03bb = 0.73 and vA = 55. The correlators relax to the plateau fAc = 0.93 with a critical amplitude\nhA = 0.18.\nThe test of the superposition laws for the long-time relaxation parts of the correlators is left to the reader. This second scaling law of MCT relates the \u03b1-relaxation peaks for\nthe loss spectra for \u03c7\u2032\u2032A (\u03c9) > 0.1. Kohlrausch-law fits and\nvon Schweidler asymptotes have been added to the data for\nT = 257K and T = 247K, respectively, in order to emphasize that the results for the evolution of the below-plateaudecay process follows the familiar pattern. Notice that the\nresponse for T = 257K exhibits the von Schweidler-law decay, log \u03c7A (t) = const. \u2212 (1 \u2212 b) logt for the large time interval 0.1ns 6 t 6 10ns. The measurement for this temperature\npermits a rather precise determination of the exponent b and,\nthereby, of \u03bb.\nThe light-dashed lines in Fig. 4 are fits of the data by the\nfirst-scaling-law expression (28) with freely adjusted scales s\u03c3\nand t\u03c3 . For T > 270K, these fits describe the data outside the\ntransient regime up to times within the von Schweidler-law\nregion. A more detailed documentation of this result can be\nfound in Ref. [10], where also consistency of the fitted scales\ns\u03c3 , t\u03c3 , and t\u03c3\u2032 with the MCT-power-law formulas was demonstrated. The scaling-law results calculated with the MCT values for the scales hA , s\u03c3 , and t\u03c3 in Eq. (28) are shown in\nFig. 4 as dash-dotted lines marked sc for the T = 257K and\nT = 247K data.

The\nlight full line shows the critical correlator calculated for \u03bb = 0.73,\nand vA = 55. The dashed line marked vS exhibits a von Schweidler\nlaw, Eq. (6), for a time scale chosen to match the T = 247K correlator. The dashed line marked K is a Kohlrausch-law fit for the\nT = 257K curve with exponent \u03b2 = 0.95. The dotted line exhibits\nthe formula (8) with t0 = 0.00246ps. The upper panel shows the critical decay (c) together with the leading- (t \u2212a ) and next-to-leadingorder asymptotic solution (9a) (t \u22122a ). The dotted curve labeled cc\ndisplays the leading-order solution from Eq. (18) with \u03c7cc\n0 = 0.067\nand \u03c9cA = 7.25ps. The points of 10% deviation of the approximations t \u2212a , t \u22122a , and cc from the critical decay are indicated by the\ndiamond, circle, and triangle, respectively.

For T > 270K the distance\nparameter \u03b5 exceeds 10%; the leading asymptotic expansion\nformula for the plateau-crossing process is not applicable for\nsuch large distances of the control parameter from the critical\nvalue. In contrast, the scaling law (28) describes the T = 247K\nresult well for the large time interval 0.04ns < t < 10ns. In\nthis case, the distance parameter \u03b5 = \u22120.008 is so small that\nthe leading-order expansion result for the plateau crossing,\nEq.

The lower panel shows the susceptibility\nspectra \u03c7\u2032\u2032A (\u03c9) for the correlators shown in the lower panel of Fig. 5.\nThe leading-order approximation to the critical spectrum, Eq. (11a),\nis shown as dotted straight line marked \u03c9a . The dashed line labeled\nsc' exhibits the interpolation formula (29) with the von Schweidler\nexponent b = 0.59 and the critical exponent a replaced by a\u2032\u2032 = 0.24.\nThe upper panel exhibits the critical spectrum as full line with label\nc, the leading-order asymptotic approximation, Eq. (11c), (dotted,\nlabeled \u03c9a ) and Eq. (11a), (dashed, labeled \u03c92a ). The approximation\nby the Cole-Cole function for \u03c9cA = 7.25ps\u22121 (cc), Eq. (17), is shown\ndotted, the inclusion of the correction, Eq. (15), yields the dashed\ncurve labeled ccc. The points of 10% deviation of the approximations\n\u03c9\u2212a , \u03c9\u22122a , and cc from the critical spectrum are indicated by the\ndiamond, circle, and triangle, respectively. The frequencies \u03c9cA and\n\u03c9/(2\u03c0) = \u03bd = 1THz are marked by arrows.\n\nFigure 5 shows that the T = 247K response is close to\nthe critical one for t 6 1ns. The straight dashed line with\nslope \u22121.15, which is shown in Fig. 4, demonstrates that the\n\u2032\ncritical response exhibits a power-law decay \u03c7A (t) \u221d 1/t 1+a ,\n\u2032\na = 0.15, for 2ps < t < 100ps. This is equivalent to a power\u2032\nlaw decay of the correlator: \u03c6A (t) \u2212 fac \u221d 1/t a . In qualitative agreement with the prediction by Eq. (5a), the crossover\nfrom the t \u2212a decay to the \u2212t b decay causes an inflection\npoint for the \u03c6A (t)-versus-logt curve in Fig. 5. The corresponding crossover from the \u03c9\u2212b wing of the \u03b1-peak to\n\u2032\u2032\nsome \u03c9a spectrum causes the loss minimum located near\nlog \u03c9 = \u22122.5 in Fig. 6. The dashed curve marked sc\u2032 exhibits\na description of this minimum by the function \u03c7\u2032\u2032A (\u03c9)/\u03c7min =\n\n\f12\ni\nh\n\u2032\u2032\nb (\u03c9/\u03c9min )a + a\u2032\u2032 (\u03c9min /\u03c9)b /(a\u2032\u2032 + b) which is suggested\nby Eq. (29). For salol, as opposed to BZP, the minimum\nposition decreases strongly with decreasing |\u03b5|, in qualitative\nagreement with the first-scaling-law results.\nThe inconsistent exponents for T = 247K in the regime\n2ps < t <100ps indicate that the leading-order asymptotic description is still not applicable; the exponents a\u2032 = 0.15 obtained from the fit of the OKE data and a\u2032\u2032 = 0.24 obtained\nfrom the fit of the corresponding minimum are different and\nboth are smaller than the correct value of a = 0.31. The deviation of the critical correlator from the leading-order power-law\nresult (8) and (10) within the specified time interval is caused\nby the large value for the correction amplitude: K\u0302A = \u22121.78.\nThis value implies an onset time for the t \u2212a decay of beyond 20ps as shown by the diamond in Fig. 5. The highfrequency part of the loss minimum is located in the region\n10ns\u22121 < \u03c9 < 1ps\u22121 . Figure 6 demonstrates that the \u03c9a law\ndoes not describe the critical loss there. Inclusion of the leading correction terms for the analytic description of the critical\ndynamics, i.e., using Eq. (9a) for the correlator and Eq. (11a)\nfor the loss spectrum, explains the result for t > 0.6ps and\n\u03c9 6 25ns\u22121 , as demonstrated in Figs. 5 and 6, respectively.\nFrom Eq. (13c), one derives the correction amplitude for\nthe modulus K\u0302Am = 0.177. The leading-order formula (30a)\nfor the relaxation kernel describes the kernel mA outside the\ntransient regime. The corresponding expression (30b) for the\ncorrelator and the equivalent Cole-Cole formula for the loss\nspectrum account for the critical glassy dynamics, as shown in\nFigs. 5 and 6. The Cole-Cole formula with correction term of\namplitude K\u0302Ac = 0.09 yields a slight improvement compared\nto the equation based on K\u0302Ac = 0, as shown in Fig. 6 by the\ncurve with label ccc. Equation (16b) leads to the Cole-Cole\nfrequency for salol: \u03c9cA = 7.25ps\u22121. This value is close to the\nloss peak for the normal-liquid dynamics: \u03c9cAtmic \u2248 1. The\npart of the glassy critical loss spectrum which is relevant for\nthe explanation of the data in Fig. 4 deals with the regime\n10\u22124 6 \u03c9/\u03c9cA 6 10\u22121 . Within this frequency interval, the\nCole-Cole spectrum increases smoothly with \u03c9. Therefore,\nthe leading-order formulas (10) or (11c) describe the dynamics qualitatively. However, the true critical spectrum differs\nfrom its low-frequency asymptote, Eq. (11c). Hence, the description of the dynamics by the scaling law is not correct\nquantitatively. Within the specified interval, the log \u03c7\u2032\u2032A (\u03c9)versus-log\u03c9 spectrum can be approximated reasonably by a\nstraight line, log \u03c7\u2032\u2032A (\u03c9) \u2248 const. + a\u2032\u2032 log \u03c9, a\u2032\u2032 = 0.24. As a\nresult, the critical dynamics is approximated well by a power\nlaw decay specified by an exponent a\u2032\u2032 smaller than the critical\nexponent a.\nIn the preceding section, the critical spectra have been discussed for both small and intermediate Cole-Cole frequencies\n\u03c9cq ; the case of a large Cole-Cole frequency is found in the\ndepolarized-light-scattering spectra for CKN [3, 29]. In the\nfits with a schematic model by Alba-Simionesco and coworkers [30, 31] one can identify a Cole-Cole peak for the critical\nspectra, but the description with the power-law solution is superior if terms up to order \u03c92a are considered.\n\nV.\n\nCOLE-COLE WING\n\nFigures 1\u20133 and 4\u20136 demonstrate the scenarios for the evo\u22121\n\u22121\nlution of the glassy dynamics for \u03c9cq \u226a tmic\nand \u03c9cq \u2248 tmic\n,\nrespectively, for the probing variable described by the second\ncorrelator of a two-component schematic MCT model. Solutions for this model, which exemplify a scenario as shown\nin Fig. 3, have been discussed before by Cummins [32].\nHe pointed out that the evolution of the wing phenomenon\nobtained from the model is similar to the one known for\ndielectric-loss spectroscopy for glycerol and several van-derWaals liquids [33]. He emphasizes also that the cited measurements refer to temperatures T below Tc , while the calculations are done for T > Tc . Furthermore, the experimental data demonstrate the wing only for frequencies below\n\u22121\n10GHz\u2248 10\u22122tmic\n. So far, no wing has been reported which\noccurs in the two-decade frequency window adjacent to the\nmicroscopic excitation region.\nIn order to describe the wing phenomenon quantitatively,\none can extend the Cole-Cole formula so that the spectrum\ncan be described also for small but non-vanishing separation parameters \u03c3 = C\u03b5 \u221d (Tc \u2212 T )/Tc . The leading-order expression for the plateau-crossing process of the fluctuatingforce correlators reads in analogy to Eq. (5a): mq (t) = fqm c +\nhm\nq g\u00b1 (t/t\u03c3 ), \u03b5 \u2277 0. Laplace transformation yields \u03c9mq (\u03c9) =\n\u2212 fqm c + hm\nq C(\u03c9). Function C(\u03c9) obeys a scaling law,\nC(\u03c9) =\n\np\n|\u03c3|c\u00b1 (\u03c9t\u03c3 ) ,\n\n\u03b5 \u2277 0,\n\n(31)\n\nwith the control-parameter independent shape functions\nc\u00b1 (\u03c9\u0302) given by the Laplace transforms g\u00b1 (\u03c9\u0302) of the shape\nfunctions g\u00b1 (t\u02c6): c\u00b1 (\u03c9\u0302) = \u03c9\u0302g\u00b1 (\u03c9\u0302). Substitution of \u03c9mq (\u03c9)\ninto Eq. (3b) yields the desired result. Expansion of the righthand side in terms of the small parameter C(\u03c9) and comparison with the result for \u03c7q (\u03c9) following from Eq. (5a) reproduces the relations (13a,13b) for the critical arrested parts and\ncritical amplitudes.

[18]\nfor the special case of the second correlator \u03c6A (t) and in the\nlimit of infinite coupling strength vA . It is shown here, that\nEq. (32a) can be derived without such restrictions. The leading correction to Eq. (32a) can be calculated from the asymptotic expansions in [14, 16] in a straightforward manner; however, the evaluation of the result for fitting data is rather involved. Focusing on the critical decay, one can extend the\npreceding formula by adding the large-frequency part of the\ncorrection:\n\nThis expression describes the small-\u03b5 dynamics for \u03c9tmic <\n1 and frequencies extending down to the beginning of the\nvon Schweidler-law decay.\n\n\f13\n\n\u03c7\"A(\u03c9)\n\n+\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u00d7\n0.01\n\ncc\n-5\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\nc\n\n\u03c9A\n-2\n\n\u03bd=1THz\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n-1\n\nlog10\u03c9[ps ]\nFIG. 7: Asymptotic description of the wing in BZP.

(32a), can be used.\nFigure 7 demonstrates that this result accounts for the T =\n251K spectrum for the large dynamical range 10\u22123ps\u22121 < \u03c9 <\n1ps\u22121 . The scaling-law result for the loss spectrum, \u03c7\u2032\u2032A (\u03c9) =\nhACA\u2032\u2032 (\u03c9), is shown as dotted line sc; it can describe only a\npart of the von Schweidler-law spectrum for \u03c9 < 10\u22123ps\u22121 ,\nbut is inadequate for larger frequencies. This observation for\nthe dynamics in the frequency domain is equivalent to the\none demonstrated in Fig. 1 for the results in the time domain. The second-scaling-law result for the loss spectrum\nis exhibited as dash-dotted line. It follows from Eq. (7),\n\u03c7\u2032\u2032A (\u03c9) = (\u03c9t\u03c3\u2032 )\u03c6\u0303\u2032\u2032A (\u03c9t\u03c3\u2032 ), and accounts for the loss peak for\n\u03c9 < 10\u22123ps\u22121 . Combining the result for the second scaling\nlaw for the modulus with the result for the first scaling law for\nthe loss spectrum explains the BZP spectrum for T = 251K\nfor \u03c9 < 1ps\u22121 including in particular the \u03b1-peak wing. The\nsmall but systematic discrepancies between the loss spectrum\nin the structural-relaxation regime and the asymptotic MCT\nexpressions result from the fact that the distance parameter\n\u03b5 = (T \u2212 Tc )/Tc \u2248 0.07 is so large, that the asymptotic results\nfor the scales still have noticeable errors while the shape functions already agree well with the nontrivial spectra.\nStarting from the state that fits the 251K data for BZP, a\nnumber of extrapolations are possible within the schematic\nmodel. Keeping all parameters but (v1 , v2 ) fixed, two additional states shall be considered; they are indicated by \u00d7 and\n+ in the left inset of Fig. 1; and their spectra are marked\naccordingly in Fig. 7. The first state point (\u00d7) is close\nto the transition point and is characterized by \u03c3 = \u22120.003\n\n-1\n-0.8\n\nt\n\n-2\nlog10\u03c7A(t)\n\nsc\n\n0.1\n\n(\u03b5 = \u22120.01). Solutions at this point are shown in Ref. [12]\nfor \u03c7(t) and \u03c7A (t). The respective spectrum \u03c7\u2032\u2032A (\u03c9) in Fig. 7\nexhibits nearly-constant loss for 0.4 10\u22123ps\u22121 < \u03c9 < 0.4ps\u22121\nwithin a 10% margin. In this frequency window the maximum\naround \u03c9cA indicates an emerging Cole-Cole peak; the minimum at \u03c9 = 10\u22123 ps\u22121 is caused by the crossover of the highfrequency wing of the \u03b1-peak and the low-frequency wing of\nthe Cole-Cole peak. This minimum is ruled by the first scaling\nlaw and the divergent time scale t\u03c3 . The second state (+) is an\ninterpolation between \u00d7 and the solution for BZP; the separation parameter is \u03c3 = \u22120.01 (\u03b5 = \u22120.03), and the point is chosen similar to the ones used in Fig. 4 of Ref. [32]. The spectrum in Fig. 7 shows a wing, \u03c7\u2032\u2032A (\u03c9) \u221d \u03c9\u22120.1 , for almost three\norders of magnitude in frequency. Hence, the crossover between \u03b1- and Cole-Cole peaks can be interpreted as a power\u2032\nlaw wing \u03c9\u2212b for some range in frequencies and control parameters without fine-tuning. The evolution of the crossover\nprogresses from a wing with gradually lower exponents b\u2032 to\nnearly-constant loss and eventually the emergence of a ColeCole peak. While the extrapolations presented in this paragraph are not at all implied by the fit of the data, the scenarios\nseem nevertheless possible for realistic parameter values.\n\nsc\n-3\nc\n\n1/\u03c9A\n\n-4\n\n-5\n\n0\n\n1\n\ncc\n\n2\n3\nlog10t[ps]\n\n4\n\nFIG. 8: Asymptotic description of the OKE data for BZP. The full\nline reproduces the BZP data for T = 251K from [9]; the dotted line\nreproduces the fit from Fig. 1. The dashed curve, the dash-dotted\ncurve sc, and the dotted curve cc respectively show the Fourier backtransforms of the extended Cole-Cole susceptibility in Eq. (32a), of\nthe first scaling law, and of the Cole-Cole law in Eq. (17), cf. Fig. 7.\n\nTo conclude the discussion of BZP, let us return to the OKE\ndata for T = 251K as shown in Fig. 8. In addition to data and\nfit for this state, the Fourier backtransforms of the asymptotic\ncurves from Fig. 7 are displayed. While the asymptotic solution at the critical point (labeled cc) covers only less than\na decade, the extended Cole-Cole susceptibility in Eq. (32a)\ndescribes the data over three orders of magnitude in time and\nthereby explains the t \u22120.8 -law found empirically. The remain-\n\n\f14\ning discrepancies are again due to the relatively large distance\nparameter for this state; Fig. 3 of Ref. [12] shows prefect\nagreement with the Cole-Cole law for states closer to the transition including state \u00d7 from Fig. 1.\n\n0.1\n\n\u03c7\"A(\u03c9)\n\nsc\n0.01\nc\n\n\u03b1\n-6\n\n-4\n\n\u03c9A\n\ncc\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\nlog10\u03c9[ps ]\nFIG. 9: Asymptotic description of the minimum in salol. The full\nline reproduces the salol loss spectrum for T = 247K from Fig. 6\nand the dashed one exhibits the spectrum of the extended Cole-Cole\nsusceptibility, Eq. (32a). The triangles mark the points of 10% deviation between these spectra. The dotted line cc is the Cole-Cole\nspectrum for the critical point, and the line sc shows the first-scalinglaw result for the susceptibility; the diamonds mark the points where\nsc deviates by 10% from the loss spectrum. The dash-dotted line\nrepresents the second-scaling-law result for the loss peak.\n\nDifferent from the case for BZP, the lowest temperature\navailable for salol, T = 247K, is described by a much smaller\ndistance parameter, \u03b5 \u2248 0.01, and therefore shares a larger frequency regime, say \u03c9 . 0.1ps\u22121 , with the critical loss spectrum, see the lower panel of Fig. 6. Being so close to the\ncritical point, the second scaling law in Fig. 9 \u2013 labeled \u03b1 \u2013\nis indistinguishable from the loss spectrum for \u03c9 6 10\u22124ps\u22121 .\nThe first scaling law sc describes the solution up to around\n\u03c9 . 0.005ps\u22121 which is the same as for the solution at the\ncritical point, cf. upper panel of Fig. 6. As for the critical\nspectrum, the leading-order approximation in Eq. (32a) improves the description to larger frequencies by two decades\nup to \u03c9 \u2248 0.1ps\u22121 before crossing over to the Cole-Cole peak\nwhich in this case is hidden under the microscopic excitations.\n\nVI. CONCLUSION\n\nWithin the regime of glassy dynamics, susceptibilities\n\u03c7q (\u03c9) and moduli \u03c9mq (\u03c9) are related by Eq. (3b); and at the\ncritical point, susceptibilities and moduli are both described\nby the universal power law \u03c9a . The range of validity of this\npower law is given by amplitudes for the correction \u03c92a \u2013 K\u0302q\nfor the susceptibilities and K\u0302qm for the moduli, which are related by Eq. (13c). For some parameter regions a large value\nof |K\u0302q | can render the power-law expansion for the susceptibilities irrelevant, while the correction amplitude |K\u0302qm | is so\n\nsmall that the universal power-law can be used for the description of the modulus successfully. Typically, this occurs if K\u0302q\nis large and negative, and this can be expected if the plateau\nvalue fqc is high, cf. Eq. (13c). In this case, the susceptibility\ncan be described well by the expansion of its inverse, Eq. (15).\nFor vanishing correction K\u0302qm = Kqcc = 0, formula, the susceptibility at the critical point is given by the Cole-Cole law (17),\na formula first introduced in 1941 [13].\nThe Cole-Cole frequency \u03c9cq in Eq. (17) introduces a characteristic scale for assorting the critical dynamics into three\n\u22121\ncategories. (1) If \u03c9cq is large compared to the scale tmic\nfor\nthe band of normal liquid excitations, the Cole-Cole susceptibility reduces to the leading-order scaling-law formula which\nis implied by Eq. (5a). There is a control-parameter sensitive\nminimum as discussed for Eq. (29) that interpolates between\nthe von Schweidler-law tail of the \u03b1-peak, \u03c7\u2032\u2032q (\u03c9) \u221d 1/\u03c9b , and\nthe critical spectrum \u03c7\u2032\u2032q (\u03c9) \u221d \u03c9a , where a and b are related via\nthe exponent parameter \u03bb. As an example for such a scenario\none can cite the molten salt CKN. While the leading-order\nresult alone is not sufficient to describe the measured data\nquantitatively, the power-law expansion in Eq. (11a) yields a\nsatisfactory description that is superior to the Cole-Cole solu\u22121\ntion [29]. (2) If \u03c9cq is close to tmic\n, one encounters a scenario\ndemonstrated in Fig. 9 for salol. There is a control-parameter\nsensitive loss minimum. It originates from the crossover between the von Schweidler-law tail and the critical spectrum;\nand the critical spectrum approaches the maximum of the underlying Cole-Cole peak. A description by Eq. (29) is possible\nonly, if the exponent a is replaced by some effective one a\u2032\u2032 ,\nwhich is smaller than a, cf. Fig. 6. (3) If \u03c9cq is smaller than\nthe microscopic time scale, say \u03c9cqtmic \u2248 0.05, we obtain the\nscenario seen in Fig. 7 for benzophenone (BZP). In this case,\nthe von Schweidler-law part of the \u03b1-peak, \u03c7\u2032\u2032q \u221d 1/\u03c9b , crosses\n\u2032\nover to some flatter wing, \u03c7\u2032\u2032q \u221d 1/\u03c9b , a < b\u2032 < b. This wing\nis caused by approaching the Cole-Cole spectrum for frequencies around the maximum at \u03c9cq . For yet higher frequencies,\none encounters a crossover \u2013 from the high-frequency part of\nthe Cole-Cole spectrum for structural relaxation to the spectrum due to normal-liquid excitations \u2013 producing a different\nkind of a minimum. The position of this minimum is controlparameter insensitive. For the understanding of this minimum,\nboth the scaling-law (28) and the interpolation formula (29)\nare irrelevant. On the other hand, as shown in Sec. V and\nespecially in Fig. 7, it is possible to describe the wing rather\naccurately by the leading-order formula (32a). If the \u03b1-peak\nis shifted to yet lower frequencies, the wing can give way to a\nseparate Cole-Cole peak.\nAll figures in this work have been prepared with model\nparameters that reproduce the OKE-response functions of\nbenzophenone (BZP) and salol. Hence, Fig. 7 implies that\nthe BZP spectra for temperatures near 250K, when measured by depolarized light-scattering in backward direction,\nshould exhibit an \u03b1-peak wing for frequencies \u03bd between\nabout 1GHz and about 100GHz. The crossover from the\nvon Schweidler-law wing to the wing induced by the ColeCole peak is expected to occur around 1GHz. This crossover\nposition depends sensitively on the temperature, because the\nvon Schweidler-law relaxation depends sensitively on T .\n\n\f15\nThe Cole-Cole law with correction, Eq. (15), has been derived in its fully general microscopic version in Sec. III; only\nin Secs. IV and V the theory was specialized to schematic\nmodels. While for the schematic models a number of parameters can be fixed to describe experimental data, for microscopic models the static structure of the model system determines these parameters uniquely. A first example for ColeCole dynamics in a microscopic model has been discussed recently for the mean-squared displacement \u03b4r2 (t) of the hardsphere system [34]; including the Mittag-Leffler function for\nthe critical relaxation allows for an analytic description of the\nmean-squared displacement for the full range of the dynamics\n\nsimilar to BZP in Fig. 7. In addition, the Cole-Cole dynamics was identified in the data measured by van Megen et. al\n[35] where Eq. (15) accounts for the data for an interval in\ntime of three orders of magnitude adjacent to the transient dynamics. Hence, the results discussed above seem relevant for\nboth molecular and colloidal glasses and can be expected to\nfacilitate more detailed investigations.\nI want to thank W.
