Introduction\n\nA\n\nS a conducting body moves through a magnetic field, it normally experiences a force to oppose the motion due\nto eddy or Foucault currents1. These are created from the EMF that is produced by the magnetic flux change.\nHowever, if the magnetic field is uniform, the EMF that is produced initially is canceled by the electric field that is\nalso produced due to charge separation. This is not always well understood2.\nIn this paper, we examine the effects of a conducting sphere moving through a gradient magnetic field. Although\nthe description is simple, the physics behind the solutions to these effects are not only understudied, but can be very\ncomplicated as well. Particularly when the conductor is moving very fast (non-relativistic) or better stated, when the\nmagnetic Reynolds number1 is large. We attempt to discuss this problem by first examining a simple situation (low\nvelocity) where we can describe the analytical solution, then move to a more complicated scenario (high velocity).\nAlthough there are numerical solutions to these cases, those solutions often fail to show the relationships between\nproperties of the system. In fact as J. B, Jackson3 says, \"Faraday's law of induction is somewhat tricky to apply to\nmoving circuits...\".\nFor the low Reynolds number case, we conduct both an experiment as well as solve the problem by way of an\nanalytical approximation. For the experiment, we have a superconducting magnet based on a Helmholtz coil design\nthat is fixed at 4 Tesla at the center. Various solid metallic spheres are dropped into the magnetic field and the fall\ntime from release to the arrival at the center of the coil pair is recorded using laser beams, as shown\ndiagrammatically in figure 2. The interaction of the magnetic field with these spherical objects leads to the\ndevelopment of eddy currents that produce an induced magnetic field which then generates a force opposing the\ngravitational force, thus reducing the fall velocity and increasing the fall time.\nFor the analytical model approximation, we use a piecewise linear approximation for the magnetic field. The\nmost important feature of the field is the gradient and our linear approximation accurately captures that slope. The\n2\nrelevant quantity is Bmax\nL2 , the maximum magnetic field divided by the linear dimension over which that field\nchanges from 0 to the maximum value. The analytical approximation and the experimental results have very close\nagreement.\nFor the high velocity case, we use a commercial software package, MagNet by Infolytica Corporation. In this\ncase, the Helmholtz coil configuration and spheres are modeled with the software. A low velocity simulation shows\ngood agreement with both the analytical approximation and the actual experiment. Following this, the high velocity\n1\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\n\fcase is simulated. While the velocity decrease is only slight in this case, there are significant differential forces built\nup over the sphere. These forces seem to flatten and extrude the sphere into a prolate spheroid.\nOne possible application for this work would be for protection from space debris. The current configuration of\nthe ISS shielding uses a \"bumper\" and \"catcher\" setup4. The idea is that the debris will hit the bumper (aluminum),\nmelt due to impact and spread out (due to design) across the catcher, thus distributing the force over a greater area. If\nthis system also included a magnetic field, the forces on the mass could be further spread out and slowed. This\nwould result in the need for less shielding.\n\nII. Low Magnetic Reynolds Number Case\nIn this case we will examine a sphere moving through a magnetic field gradient at low velocity or with a low\nmagnetic Reynolds number, Rm. We will define the magnetic Reynolds number as,\nRm = \u03bc\u03c3vl,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03bc is the magnetic permeability, \u03c3 is the conductivity, v is the velocity and l is the characteristic length which\nin our case will be the radius of the sphere.\nA. Analytical Approximation\nTo begin, we wish to calculate the net force acting against the sphere due to a gradient magnetic field. We will\nexamine the simple case of the sphere traveling transversely through a field that is only changing linearly in the\ndirection of motion. For the analytical approximation, we will assume that the velocity is constant. The purpose of\nthis is to reduce complexity of the calculations. As can be seen in figure 1, we expect that there will be a net force\nthat opposes the sphere due to the gradient.\nSince we are in the low Reynolds number regime, we can neglect any perturbations to the magnetic field. With\nthis and our previous assumptions, we solve the appropriate Maxwell equations to arrive at an equation for the\nopposing force,\n2\n2\u03c0\u03c3 Bmax\nF\u2212v =\nvr 5 ,\n(2)\n15 L2\nwhere Bmax is the maximum point of the field, L is the length of the gradient, r is the radius, v is the constant\nvelocity and \u03c3 is the conductivity. Even though we initially assume a constant velocity, we relax this assumption in\norder to determine the motion experienced in the field by solving the equation of motion using this force.\n\nFigure 1. Induced current and induced forces associated with a sphere moving through a positive magnetic field gradient. The\nleft diagram is a view of the sphere seen from a position orthogonal to the magnetic field lines and the right diagram shows a\ncross section of the sphere seen from a position along the magnetic field lines. Note that because the gradient is positive, the\ninduced magnetic field is in the opposite direction of the external field.\n\nB. Experimental Results\nTo verify the analytical approximation we perform an experiment using a magnetic consisting of a pair of\nsuperconducting Helmholtz coils capable of operating at up to 6 Tesla. Access to the high magnetic field at the\ncenter of the magnet is by three orthogonal passages, including a vertical passage through which spheres are\ndropped and a horizontal passage through which a laser beam is passed for timing arrival of the spheres at the center.\n2\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\n\fFor the experiment, we use three spheres: an aluminum sphere (Al 2011) with a 1\" diameter, an aluminum sphere\n(Al 2017) with a 3\u20444\" diameter and a copper sphere (Cu 145) with a 1\u20442\" diameter. The spheres were released above\nthe magnet and the fall time to the center of the magnet was recorded using a laser sheet, as shown diagrammatically\nin figure 2.\n\nFigure 2. Geometry of the Helmholtz magnetic coils and photographs of the laboratory set up. Spheres are dropped through\na vertical hole (yellow line shows the fall trajectory) and pass into the high field region at the center of the magnet coils. The fall\ntime is recorded by a pair of laser beams as shown in green.\n\nAs the spheres move through the magnetic field, eddy currents are produced with creates a small induced\nmagnetic field that opposes the external field. This field, along with the eddy currents produce a force that opposes\nthe motion of the sphere, thus increasing the fall time. To compare this with the analytical approximation, we solve\nfor the axial component (x component) of the magnetic field, along the transverse or radial direction through the\ncenter between the coil pair as indicated in figure 3 using the specifications of the magnet.\n\nFigure 3. Modeled and actual magnetic field gradient. The actual gradient is calculated from the specifications given for the\nmagnet. The modeled field is a piecewise linear approximation.\n\nThe analytical model uses a piecewise linear approximation shown in blue. The most important feature of the\n2\nfield is the gradient and the linear approximation accurately captures that slope. The relevant quantity is Bmax\nL2\nwhere the maximum magnetic field is divided by the linear dimension over which that field changes from 0 to the\nmaximum value. Accordingly, the values for the spheres are also used in the analytical solution to determine an\napproximate fall time.\nFigure 4 shows the results of the drop tests and the analytical predictions. Both aluminum and copper alloy\nspheres were tested. The significant difference in the fall times associated with the radius of the sphere as predicted\n3\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\n\fby the analytical approximation in Eq. (2). Note that the fall time for the solid 1\" aluminum sphere is almost three\ntimes that of free fall. The analytical model captures the fall times to within 4% of the measured values.\n\nConducting Sphere in Magnetic Field Gradient\n1.461\n\nSphere Radius, in\n\n0.47\n\n1.369\n\n0.42\n\n0.709\n\n0.37\n\n0.721\n\n0.32\n\nExperiment\n\n0.403\n\n0.27\n0.22\n\nTheory\n\n0.423\n\n0.17\n0.12\n0.300\n\n0.500\n\n0.700\n\n0.900\n\n1.100\n\n1.300\n\n1.500\n\nFall Time, s\nFigure 4.

Numerical Solution\nIn addition to the analytical and experimental solutions, we also use a modified commercial code called MagNet\nby Infolytica to simulate the experiment. This is done so that we can use our previous results as a benchmark for the\nnumerical solution. This is needed as we will rely more heavily on the numerical solutions for the high Reynolds\nnumber cases. As can be seen in figure 5, the simulated results correspond very well to the analytical approximation.\n\nFigure 5. Comparison of analytical approximation and simulated numerical results using commercial code.\n\nIII. High magnetic Reynolds Number Case\nIn the high magnetic Reynolds number case, we cannot rely on our analytical approximation because the induced\nmagnetic field is much larger. In this case we are examining objects with velocities that exceed 1 km/s.\n\n4\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\n\fA. MagNet Simulation\nWe simulate a sphere moving in the high Reynolds number regime. In the case of a copper sphere moving at 1\nkm/s, the reduction in velocity is minimal over the distance of the gradient, even though there is a large deceleration\nas shown in figure 6. This is due to low momentum exchange over the time of the travel.\n6000\n\n1000.1\n\nAcceleration of Sphere (High Velocity)\n\nVelocity of Sphere (High Velocity)\n\n1000.0\n4000\n\n999.9\n999.8\n\n0\n\nVelocity, m/s\n\nAcceleration, m/s2\n\n2000\n\n-2000\n\n-4000\n\n999.7\n999.6\n\n999.5\n999.4\n999.3\n\n-6000\n\n999.2\n-8000\n\n999.1\n999.0\n\n-10000\n0.650\n\n0.700\n\n0.750\n\n0.800\n\nTime, ms\n\n0.850\n\n0.900\n\n0.650\n\n0.700\n\n0.750\n\n0.800\n\n0.850\n\n0.900\n\nTime, ms\n\nFigure 6. These two graphs show the changes in the acceleration and velocity as a conducting sphere moves through the\nmagnetic field gradient (0 to 4 Tesla over ~20cm) at low velocity (under the influence of gravity for 1 meter).\n\nHowever, the deceleration and therefore the force is very large. This implies that while at this field level and\nvelocity we cannot expect the object to slow down significantly, we may expect it to deform. This can be seen in\nfigure 7 which shows a 3-D surface picture of the induced force on a solid copper sphere with a radius of 12.7 mm\n(1\" diameter) at 1 km/s. The magnetic field extends from 0 T to 4 T over a span of ~0.2 m in the -y direction. As the\nsphere travels through the gradient, the color and arrows indicate the strength (red = strongest) and direction\n(approximately radial) of the pressure on the sphere. The largest forces are at the bottom of the sphere which has the\neffect of slowing down the sphere. The forces become very large as the velocity or gradient increases due to the\nincreased strength of the eddy currents. Therefore, the key aspect to note is the differential of the forces acting on\nthe sphere. These forces will flatten and extrude the sphere into a prolate spheroid shape. Thus the pressure of the\nimpact of the sphere against another object will be diminished.\n\nFigure 7. The top picture is a 3-D surface picture of a sphere moving through a magnetic field gradient. The sphere is moving in\nthe \u2013y direction under the influence of gravity. As the sphere travels through the gradient, the color and arrows indicate the\nstrength (red = strongest) and direction (~radial) of the pressure on the sphere. The bottom picture is a 3-D representation of the\nsphere above as forces flatten and extrude the sphere into a prolate spheroid shape.\n\n5\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\n\fB. Alegra Simulations\nOne of the advantages of the using the modified MagNet software is that it can model the well known skin\neffect2 very well. The drawback is that the objects in the software cannot be deformed. Therefore we needed to use a\nmore robust code. For this we used the Alegra code at Sandia National Laboratory. After confirming that the Alegra\ncode results agreed with our previous results, we simulated the sphere moving at various speeds and magnetic field\nstrengths in order to examine the deformation of the sphere. When the magnetic field was 4 T, there was very little\ndeformation of the solid sphere. However, at 40 T the sphere was shown to deform significantly as seen in figure 8.\nThis also shows that the greatest deformation does not occur at the highest velocity due to the finite interaction time\nin the field.\nMax Plastic Deformation vs. Velocity @ 40 Tesla\n0.7\n\n0.6\n\n3\n0.5\n5\n\nStrain, %\n\n1\n0.4\n\n0.3\n10\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\nVelocity (km/s)\n\nFigure 8. This figure shows the percent strain of a solid copper sphere moving at various velocities in a gradient with a\nmaximum of 40 Tesla. Notice the peak strain is not during peak velocity.\n\nC. High Reynolds Number Approximation\nAlthough this regime is characterized by non-linear currents and a highly perturbed magnetic field, we can still\nmake a qualitative estimation, if not a roughly quantitative approximation for the force under these conditions using\nEq (2). In this case, we can assume that the current is mostly confined in the skin layer of the sphere. Therefore, if\nwe calculate the force that is due to the shell of the sphere that has a thickness of the skin layer, we should see\nreasonable results which are shown in table 1.\nTable 1\nMag Reynold's #\n\nSimulation, m/s2\n\nApproximation, m/s2\n\nPercent Error\n\n350 (1000 m/s)\n\n12444\n\n14060\n\n13.0%\n\n920 (2631 m/s)\n\n15400\n\n23338\n\n51.5%\n\n1750 (5000 m/s)\n\n16325\n\n32585\n\n99.6%\n\nAs can be easily seen, the change in the magnetic Reynolds number is almost directly equivalent to change in the\npercent error. We can adjust for this with an appropriate adjustment to the skin depth,\n\u03b4=\n\nr\nRm\n\ne\u2212.0004 \u2219R m\n\u03c0\n\n,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere the left fraction is the diffusion depth definition5 rewritten using the Reynolds number and the right fraction is\nour empirical adjustment. Note: Classically the skin depth is equal to 2 \u03bc\u03c3\u03c9 where \u03c9 is the angular frequency of\nthe signal. However, this is for the special case of a sinusoidal signal.\n6\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\n\fIV. Protection from Orbital Debris\nThe current configuration of the International Space Station (ISS) shielding uses a \"bumper\" and \"catcher\" setup\nas seen in figure 9. The idea is that the debris will hit the \"bumper\" (aluminum), melting due to impact and spread\nout (due to design) across the \"catcher\", thus distributing the force over a greater area. Since, as previously stated, in\nthe high magnetic Reynolds regime the currents are produced in the outer surface (skin), the effect of the magnetic\nfield would be concentrated on the aluminum. This would cause the aluminum to spread out and induce a large force\non the incoming debris so that it spreads out as well. Therefore, if this system also included a magnetic field as\nshown, the forces on the mass could potentially be further spread out and slowed. This may result in the need for\nless shielding. Additionally, the current protection configuration is weakest when the debris is larger than 1\" or is\nnot moving fast enough to melt on impact. Our implementation could also help in this regard for metallic objects.\nThe force is proportional to radius, r5 so the bigger the object, the greater the effect. Also, the slower the debris was\ncoming in, the more time would exist for deformation. We suggest that this is feasible using currently produced high\ntemperature superconducting materials.\n\nFigure 8. As the debris (sphere) hits the \"bumper\", melting due to impact, the material is spread out (due to design) across the\ncatcher4. This distributes the force over a greater area. If this system also included a magnetic field, the forces on the mass could\nbe further spread out and slowed. Note that the 2000 PSI in the diagram refers to a 4 T field. A 40 T field would produce 100\ntimes more pressure.\n\nV. Conclusions\nAn analytical approximation was derived for a sphere moving at low velocity through a gradient magnetic field.\nThis was confirmed by way of an experiment using a superconducting magnet and a variety of conducting spheres.\nThis approximation give us a reasonable understanding of the variables and their magnitudes that contribute to the\nforces induced. In addition, the change in temperature was calculated and not found to be significant.\nFor the high magnetic Reynolds number case, we see significant deformation of the sphere. Therefore, a\nmagnetic field could be used to deform a projectile moving at a high rate of speed so as to spread the force of the\nimpact out over a larger area. While 40 T is an extremely high field to achieve practically, note that the simulations\nwere performed using a room temperature solid sphere. The point here is that as the sphere collides with the bumper,\nas in the ISS configuration, the sphere will tend to melt due to impact friction and compression. This would greatly\nreduce the yield strength of the sphere and thus would deform at much lower field strengths. An additional strength\nis that the magnetic field does not need to come on right at impact. With a superconducting magnetic, the field can\nbe energized ahead of time and run in a persistent mode.\n\n7\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\n\fAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported by DARPA DSO under Dr. Judah Goldwasser.
