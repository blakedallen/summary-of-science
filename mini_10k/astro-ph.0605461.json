In\naddition, our model provides a natural explanation for the presence of lower frequency\n(< 30 Hz) quasi-periodic oscillations seen in the December 2004 giant flare of SGR\n1806-20.\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe recent observational evidence (Israel et al 2005; Strohmayer & Watts 2005) of quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) during\ngiant flares in the soft gamma-ray repeaters (SGRs) 1806 \u2212 20 and 1900 + 14 may herald the beginning of an exciting new era\nfor neutron star physics (see also Barat et al (1983) for older evidence of a QPO in the flare of SGR 0526-66). These extremely\nviolent events can be understood within the \"magnetar\" model, introduced by Duncan and Thompson more than a decade\nago (Duncan & Thompson 1992; Thomson & Duncan 1995). Magnetars are neutron stars endowed with powerful magnetic\nfields (\u223c 1014\u221215 G) masquerading as both SGRs and anomalous X-ray pulsars. The giant flare events are thought to be due\nto magnetic instabilities leading to fracturing of the crust. The observed QPOs are then associated with shear oscillations\nof the magnetar's crust (Duncan 1998). This interpretation makes sense since the fundamental toroidal crustal modes have\nfrequencies (\u223c 30 \u2212 100 Hz) that could match the observations (Van Horn 1980). The properties of crustal modes have been\ninvestigated by several authors, see for example the work by Hansen & Cioffi (1980); McDermott et al (1988); Strohmayer\n(1991); Messios et al (2001); Piro (2005).\nIn previous studies the basic fact that the magnetic field strongly couples the crust to the fluid core has been ignored.\nThis key point, which is well known from discussions of pulsar glitch relaxation (Easson 1979; Abney et al 1996), was recently\nemphasised by Levin (2006). A rough estimate for the crust-core coupling timescale is provided by the Alfv\u00e9n crossing time,\n1/2\n\n\u22121\ntA = 2R/vA \u223c 70 B15\n\u03c114 R6 ms\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the magnetic field, density and radius are normalised according to B = 1015 B15 G, \u03c1 = 1014 \u03c114 g/cm3 and R = 106 R6\n2\ncm, respectively. We have also introduced the Alfv\u00e9n velocity vA\n\u2261 B 2 /4\u03c0\u03c1. The coupling timescale is comparable to the\nperiod of the fundamental crustal mode (McDermott et al 1988; Hansen & Cioffi 1980),\nPl0 \u2248 60 R6 [l(l + 1)]\u22121/2 ms\n\n(2)\n\nThis means that, for parameters relevant to the crust-core interface of a magnetar, an efficient coupling to the fluid core\nis already established within a single oscillation of a \"crustal\" mode. This has crucial implications when one attempts to\ncalculate the properties of the modes. In essence, the notion of modes confined to the crust is no longer useful and one is\nforced to consider global oscillations of the coupled crust-core system.\nIn this Letter we demonstrate that a magnetically coupled crust-core system admits oscillations with frequencies that\nmatches the observational data. Clearly, any initial disturbance in the crust region (say, following a starquake induced by\na magnetic field eruption) will generically shake the field lines and launch Alfv\u00e9n waves into the core. In contrast to Levin\n(2006), we do not think of this process as a damping mechanism. The reason for this is that the Alfv\u00e9n waves in the core will\n\n\f2\n\nGlampedakis, Samuelsson & Andersson\n\nbe capable of reaching the crust at the opposite side of the star and be reflected back. By the time that a given wave-packet\nis eventually attenuated by viscosity it would have transversed the core some \u223c 107 times. Hence, we believe that the correct\napproach to the problem is to consider the coupled crust-core system and compute global oscillation modes.\n\n2\n\nA SIMPLE TOY MODEL\n\nWe consider a plane-parallel \"star\" where the fluid core is sandwiched by two slabs of \"crust\" (this model is similar to the one\nemployed by Piro (2005)). The z coordinate runs from z = +R (the surface) to z = 0 (the core's centre) and ends up back at\nthe surface, at z = \u2212R. The crust-core interface is located at z = \u00b1Rc . The crust is elastic, with a uniform shear modulus\n\u03bc. Furthermore, uniform density, incompressibility and ideal MHD conditions are assumed everywhere. In the unperturbed\nconfiguration the magnetic field is B = B\u25e6 \u1e91.\nThe Euler equation in the crustal region is (assuming a harmonic time dependence \u03be \u223c exp(i\u03c3t)),\n\u2212 \u03c3 2 \u03bei =\n\n1 \u2202\u03c3ik\n1\n+\n[ (\u2207 \u00d7 b) \u00d7 B\u25e6 ]i ,\n\u03c1 \u2202xk\n4\u03c0\u03c1\n\nwhere\n\n\u03c3ij = \u03bc\n\n\u0014\n\n\u2202\u03be i\n\u2202\u03be j\n+\nj\n\u2202x\n\u2202xi\n\n\u0015\n\n(3)\n\n\u03c3ik and b are the perturbed shear tensor and magnetic field, respectively. Since the fluid is incompressible and all quantities\nvary only with respect to z we have,\nb = B\u25e6 [ x\u0302\u2202z \u03be x + \u0177\u2202z \u03be y ]\n\n(4)\n\nFollowing Piro (2005), we mimic the geometrical factors of the true spherical problem by making the identification\n(\u2202x2 + \u2202y2 )\u03be \u2192 \u2212l(l + 1)\u03be/R2 . To introduce l in this way is, of course, artificial. In the real spherical problem, the l-multipoles\nfollow from separation of variables. Here they are simply introduced to impose the \"correct scaling\" for the crust mode\nfrequencies. Eqn. (3) now becomes\n\n\u0002\n\n\u0014\n\n2\n\u03bc\u0303 + vA\n\u2202z2 \u03bei + \u03c3 2 \u2212 \u03bc\u0303\n\n\u0003\n\nl(l + 1)\nR2\n\n\u0015\n\n\u03bei = 0,\n\ni = x, y\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03bc\u0303 = \u03bc/\u03c1. Clearly, identical equations describe \u03be x and \u03be y , therefore we shall only solve for the former. In addition, as our\nmodel has reflection symmetry with respect to the \"centre\" z = 0. Hence it is in principle sufficient to solve only for z > 0.\nThe boundary conditions are formulated in terms of the traction components (Strohmayer 1991; Carroll et al 1986; Piro\n2005). For our combined fluid/magnetic field system the traction takes the following form in the crust region:\n2\nT i = \u03c1[\u03bc\u0303 + vA\n]\u2202z \u03be i ,\n\ni = x, y\n\nand\n\nTz = 0\n\n(6)\n\nThe corresponding expressions for the core region are obtained by setting \u03bc\u0303 = 0. Another important element is the perturbed\nelectric field,\ne=\u2212\n\ni\u03c3\ni\u03c3B\u25e6\n\u03be \u00d7 B\u25e6 =\n[\u2212x\u0302\u03be y + \u0177\u03be x ]\nc\nc\n\n(7)\n\nThe appropriate MHD boundary conditions are: (i) continuity of the tractions at the crust/core interface, (ii) vanishing\ntractions at the surface and (iii) continuity of the (normal) transverse components of the (magnetic) electric field at the\ninterface. These translate into,\n\u03be x (Rc+ ) = \u03be x (Rc\u2212 ),\n\n\u2202z \u03be x (R) = 0\n\nand\n\n2\n\u2202z \u03be x (Rc\u2212 ) = 1 + \u03bc\u0303/vA\n\u2202z \u03be x (Rc+ )\n\n\u0002\n\n\u0003\n\n(8)\n\nThese constraints imply that the displacement \u03be is a continuous function at the crust-core interface. Note also that, in solving\nthe problem one has two options. One can either solve the full problem and impose conditions analogous to (8) for negative\nz. Alternatively, one can use the symmetry of the problem and impose a suitable condition on the solution at the origin (the\neigenfunction should be either an odd or an even function).\nWe begin by considering the special case where the core is decoupled from the crust. As we will see later, this case is\nartificial in the presence of a magnetic field. However, the magnetic coupling between the crust and the fluid core can be\ndeactivated by altering the boundary conditions at the bottom of the crust (Carroll et al 1986; Piro 2005; Messios et al 2001).\nSolving the Euler equation in the crust provides the displacement,\n\u03be x = C1 e\u03b1+ z + C2 e\u03b1\u2212 z ,\n\nwhere\n\n\u03b1\u00b1 = \u00b1\n\n1\nR\n\n\u0014\n\nl(l + 1) \u2212 \u03c3\u0303 2\n2\n1 + vA\n/\u03bc\u0303\n\n\u00151/2\n\nand\n\n\u03c3\u0303 \u2261 \u03c3\n\nR\n\u03bc\u03031/2\n\n(9)\n\nThe effective decoupling between the core and the crust can be achieved by requiring vanishing tractions at the interface. We\nstress the fact that this is not the correct interface condition in the magnetic problem. Disregarding this we get,\nC2 = C1 e2Rc \u03b1+\n\n(10)\n\n\fA toy model for magnetar oscillations.\n\n3\n\nThe requirement of vanishing tractions at the surface gives a similar relation\nC2 = C1 e2R\u03b1+\n\n(11)\n\nThese two expressions are compatible provided that\ne2\u2206\u03b1+ = 1\n\n\u03c3n =\n\n\u21d2\n\n\u03bc\u03031/2\nR\n\n\u0014\n\nl(l + 1) +\n\n\u0010\n\nn\u03c0R\n\u2206\n\n\u00112 \u001a\n\n1+\n\n2\nvA\n\u03bc\u0303\n\n\u001b\u00151/2\n\nwith\n\nn = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...\n\n(12)\n\nwhere \u2206 = R \u2212 Rc is the crust thickness. This is the prediction of our toy model for the \"toroidal\" crust mode frequencies.\nIt is in good agreement with more rigorous results (McDermott et al 1988; Hansen & Cioffi 1980; Piro 2005). However, the\nmodel is inaccurate for l = 1 since a nodeless eigenfunction is allowed, a feature not found in the rigorous spherical problem.\nGiven the artificial introduction of l in the model, this is not surprising. For l \u2265 2 (and l = 1, n \u2265 1) the model predicts the\ncorrect number of nodes for the eigenfunctions. It is useful to note that the fundamental (n = 0) and first overtone (n = 1)\nquadrupole modes take the respective values \u03c3\u03030 = 2.45 and \u03c3\u03031 = 31.5 (for the latter we have assumed \u2206 = 0.1R and vA = 0).\nIn the case of the full crust-core model we solve the Euler equations in the two regions. This (again) leads to a solution\nof the form (9) in the crust, while in the core we find\n\u03be x = D1 ei\u03b2+ z + D2 ei\u03b2\u2212 z ,\n\nwhere\n\n\u03b2\u00b1 = \u00b1 \u03c3/vA\n\n(13)\n\nOnce more, the surface boundary conditions enforce (11). On the other hand, eqn. (10) is no longer valid. Instead, the\nappropriate interface conditions result in a 2 \u00d7 2 homogeneous system for the coefficients D1 and D2 . The requirement that\nthe relevant determinant must vanish provides the following condition\ne\u22122iRc \u03b2+\n\n\u0014\n\n\u03b1+\n\n\u0012\n\n1+\n\n\u03bc\u0303\n2\nvA\n\n\u0013\n\nsinh(\u2206\u03b1+ ) \u2212 i\u03b2+ cosh(\u2206\u03b1+ )\n\n\u00152\n\n\u2212e\n\n2iRc \u03b2+\n\n\u0014\n\n\u03b1+\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03bc\u0303\n1+ 2\nvA\n\n\u0013\n\nsinh(\u2206\u03b1+ ) + i\u03b2+ cosh(\u2206\u03b1+ )\n\n\u00152\n\n=0\n\n(14)\n\nwhich determines the complete spectrum of global oscillations.

Up to normalisation, this completely specifies the solution. It\nis clear that the modes are either odd or even functions with respect to the origin. It is also worth pointing out that, since the\n2\nlimit vA\n\u2192 0 is singular, some care is required in analysing how the pure crust modes emerge as the magnetic field vanishes.\n\n3\n\nRESULTS: GLOBAL MHD MODES\n\nDespite being very simple, the toy-model provides a set of interesting results. First note that we can obtain analytic solutions\n2\nto (14) for a weak magnetic field. When vA\n\u226a \u03bc\u0303 acceptable mode solutions coincide with the Alfv\u00e9n frequencies:\n\u03c3A = (k\u03c0/2Rc ) vA ,\n\nk = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...\n\n(16)\n\nRemarkably, these frequencies also satisfy (14) when e2\u2206\u03b1+ = 1, that is, when the frequency coincides with a crustal frequency\n\u03c3n . This triple intersection is naturally interpreted as a resonance between the crust and the core.\nWe have determined the exact spectrum by solving (14) numerically. A part of the spectrum for l = 2 and \u2206 = 0.1R is\nshown in the left panel of Fig. 1, together with the Alfv\u00e9n frequencies (16), as a function of the ratio\n2\n2\nvA\n/\u03bc\u0303 \u2248 0.04 B15\n\u03c1\u22121\n14\n\n(17)\n\nWe have assumed the value \u03bc\u0303 \u2248 2 \u00d7 1016 cm2 /s2 (Douchin & Haensel 2001). Figure 1 shows that, for a given value of the\nratio (17), the spectrum consists of a semi-infinite family of modes (we only show the first few). The separation between\nconsecutive modes increases as the ratio attains higher values, i.e. if we increase the magnetic field while keeping the other\nparameters fixed. The most important feature to note in the spectrum is that there are always mode-frequencies comparable\nto the crustal frequencies \u03c3n . Fig. 1 depicts the spectrum in the vicinity of \u03c30 but a similar picture arises for all frequencies\n2\n\u03c3n of a given l. As is apparent in the figure, for certain discrete values of the ratio vA\n/\u03bc\u0303 the mode frequency exactly coincides\n2\nwith a crustal frequency \u03c3n as well as one of the Alfv\u00e9n frequencies (16). For any other realistic value of vA\n/\u03bc\u0303 there is always\na mode with frequency very close (with at most a few percent deviation) to each \"crustal\" frequency \u03c3n .\nThe coupled crust-core system obviously has a much richer set of oscillation modes than the decoupled elastic crust. Yet one\ncan interpret most of the observed QPOs as pure crust modes for various values of l, see the discussion of Strohmayer & Watts\n(2005). At first sight our results may seem at variance with this interpretation. After all, our system has a number of additional\nmodes. If they are not observed we need to explain why. To do this, we take the standard model for the giant flares at face\nvalue. The magnetic field erupts and induces a starquake in the crust. On the grounds of physical intuition we would expect\nthat the initial perturbation in the crust will predominantly excite those global modes which communicate the least amount\n\n\f4\n\nGlampedakis, Samuelsson & Andersson\n3.2\n\nAlfven modes\nexact modes\nn = 0 crustal\nobserved freqs.\n\n2.8\n\n~\n\n2\n\nvA = 0.055\u03bc\n2\nvA\n\n0.1\n\n= 0.1\u03bc\n\nEcrust/ Ecore\n\n2.4\n\n~\n\n~\n\u03c3\n\n2\n1.6\n\n0.01\n\n1.2\n0.8\n0.4\n0\n\n0.001\n\n0.01\n\n0.1\n2 ~\n\nvA / \u03bc\n\n1\n\n0.001\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n~\n\u03c3\n\nFigure 1. Left panel: A part of the global mode spectrum for the toy model of a magnetar with crust-core coupling, see text for details.\nThe data corresponds to l = 2 and \u2206 = 0.1R. Note the triple intersection between the exact mode solution from eqn. (14), the Alfv\u00e9n\nmodes from eqn. (16), and the fundamental crustal frequency \u03c3\u03030 = 2.45. The black dots correspond to observed QPOs frequencies for\nSGR 1806-20, see text for discussion. Right panel: Assessing the excitation of various modes by means of the ratio between the mode\nenergy in the crust Ecrust and that in the core, Ecore . The dashed line labels the crustal frequency \u03c3\u03030 .\n\nof energy to the core. To test this idea, we calculate the total energy (kinetic + magnetic) associated with each mode and\nconsider the ratio Ecrust /Ecore . As can be seen from the right panel of Fig. 1, the results corroborate our intuition. The mode\nwhich maximises the energy ratio, i.e. should be easier to excite from an initial crust motion, is the one nearest to the resonant\nfrequency \u03c3A = \u03c30 (analogous behaviour to that depicted in the right panel of Fig. 1 is found for modes in the vicinity of all\nhigher \u03c3n frequencies, for any l). This would explain why the other modes of the system are more difficult to excite, they are\npredominantly core-Alfv\u00e9n modes which would be energetically more expensive to excite via the proposed mechanism. Similar\n2\nconclusions can be drawn from the displacement \u03be x , displayed in Fig. 2, for a fixed value of vA\n/\u03bc\u0303, as we move upwards in\nthe spectrum. The oscillation amplitude is generally far greater in the core, but the modes located in the vicinity of the crust\nfrequencies \u03c3n are exceptions. In those cases the crust oscillates with a comparable amplitude. However, these modes cannot\nbe considered as \"crustal\". The eigenfunctions clearly show that they represent global oscillations.\nThe conclusion of this discussion is that once the crust is shaken by a starquake the core-crust system will naturally choose\nto vibrate in those global modes which have frequencies similar to the frequencies of the toroidal modes of the uncoupled\ncrust, with identical values of l (and number of nodes in the crust). Hence, the model provides an explanation for all observed\nQPO frequencies, both intermediate (\u223c 30 \u2212 155 Hz, different values of l) and high frequency (\u223c 625 Hz, overtone with one\nnode in the crust). Our model differs from previous ones only in that the modes are global, not localised to the crust, and\nhence have a significant amplitude in the core.\nA key feature of Figure 1 is the existence of modes with frequencies below the fundamental crustal frequency \u03c30 . This is\ninteresting since the presence of low frequency QPOs has been confirmed in the data of both the RXTE and RHESSI satellites\n(Israel et al 2005; Watts & Strohmayer 2006): 18, 26 and 30 Hz QPOs for the December 2004 giant flare in SGR 1806-20. It\nis natural to identify the 30 Hz QPO with the fundamental crustal frequency \u03c30 (Israel et al 2005), since the higher frequency\nQPOs then fit the predictions from Eq. (2) quite well. However, we then find ourselves left with a puzzle: what is the origin\nof the remaining two frequencies? There are certainly no toroidal crustal modes with frequency below \u03c30 . Our model offers a\nnatural explanation for these low-frequency modes.\nAlthough our model is not designed to provide us with quantitatively accurate predictions, we can still attempt to match\nthe observed data for the low frequency QPOs of SGR 1806-20. To do this we first identify \u03c3\u03030 = 2.45 with the 30 Hz\nfrequency (presumably, this identification can be made rigorous in a calculation for a realistic neutron star model). Then the\nfrequencies 18 and 26 Hz correspond to modes with \u03c3\u0303 = 1.46 and 2.12, respectively. Some navigation in Fig. 1 leads us to\n2\nthe value vA\n= 0.055\u03bc\u0303 which has all three desired modes (indicated by filled circles in the figure). This value is reasonably\nconsistent with B15 \u2248 1 assuming \u03c114 \u2248 1 (note that the magnetic field estimated from the spin-down rate for SGR 1806-20\nis 7.8 \u00d7 1014 G (Woods & Thompson 2004). Moreover, the energy argument indicates that it is reasonable to expect these\nQPOs to be excited, cf. Fig. 1. Finally, we have an additional mode at \u2248 22 Hz. In a sense, this could be considered a testable\nprediction. It would certainly be rewarding if a QPO with this intermediate frequency were to be found in the data!\n\n4\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nWe have used a simple plane-parallel toy-model to discuss global MHD modes of a neutron star. The model, which takes\ninto account the magnetic coupling between the elastic crust and the fluid core, provides results that are highly suggestive.\n\n\fA toy model for magnetar oscillations.\n\n5\n\nX\n\n\u03be\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1 0\n\n0.5\n\n1 0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\nz/R\n\u03bex\n\n2\nvA\n\n= 0.055 \u03bc\u0303. The modes illustrated are, from left to right: \u03c3\u0303 = 0.74, 2.45, 9.87.\nFigure 2. Fluid displacement\nfor l = 2, \u2206 = 0.1R and\nIn the middle panel note the comparable oscillation amplitudes in the crust and the core for the mode with \u03c3 \u2248 \u03c30 = \u03c3A .\n\nThe system is characterised by a rich spectrum of global modes \"living\" both in the crust and core, with a mixed magnetoelastic identity. Among myriads of available modes (for a given multipole l and ratio of Alfv\u00e9n velocity to shear velocity) the\nsystem will naturally excite the mode(s) which transfer as little energy as possible to the core, thus minimising the overall\nenergy budget. We demonstrated that these favoured global oscillation modes have frequencies that are similar to the \"pure\ncrustal\" frequencies from the non-magnetic problem. Our model provides support for the asteroseismology interpretation for\nthe observed magnetar QPOs. In addition, it provides a natural explanation for the presence of lower frequency (< 30 Hz)\nQPOs seen in the December 2004 giant flare of SGR 1806-20.\nEven though our model is based on drastic simplifications, the basic physics predicted should survive for more realistic\nneutron star models. Obviously, one must expect corrections (and extra technical complications!) once the real problem is\nconsidered. A more complex magnetic field configuration will lead to intricate coupling between different multipoles, nonuniform density/crust elasticity and core stratification leading to buoyancy effects are likely to affect the mode structure,\nand the expected superconductivity will affect that nature of the Alfven waves. Nevertheless, global MHD modes due to the\ninescapable crust-core coupling are still likely to emerge, leading to intricate resonance phenomena.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe thank Anna Watts for helpful discussions.
