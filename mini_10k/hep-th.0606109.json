Introduction\nIntersecting brane models (IBM's) have been widely studied in recent years as quasi-realistic\ncompactifications of superstring theory [9]. One reason for their popularity is that they\nappear to contain all of the necessary ingredients \u2013 the Standard Model, additional gauge\nsectors to provide supersymmetry breaking, and the possibility of stabilizing moduli by\nfluxes and other means \u2013 without requiring sophisticated mathematics to analyze.\nIn this work, we carry out a systematic analysis of a simple class of models of this\ntype, namely intersecting brane models on type IIB orientifolds of T 6 /Z2 \u00d7 Z2 . We begin\nwith some brief comments regarding the purpose of explicit constructions of string vacua,\nafter which we will describe in more detail the approach taken in this paper.\nThe primary goals in the study of string compactifications at present are:\n1. To find models which reproduce all physics observed experimentally to date, and to\nwork out the predictions of these models for future observations.\n2. To discover new physical mechanisms which might have observable signatures, or\nmight solve theoretical problems.\n3. To get an overall picture of the set of all \"interesting\" models, and to find structure\nin this set which might help in making predictions, or in uncovering deeper formal\nstructures in string/M theory.\nThese are complementary goals, each with strengths and weaknesses. We note that we\nhave no reason to think that the straightforward approach of (1) will lead to a unique\ncandidate vacuum, nor that any particular mechanism found in (2) will be realized in our\nphysical vacuum; on the other hand (3) is at present a complicated problem which must be\nsimplified to make progress, running the risk of missing important features of the physics.\nIn any case it seems to us that all three goals are essential to any clear understanding of\nthe implications and testability of string theory.\nWhile the methods we develop in this paper may be useful in explicit model building\nas in (1), our primary interest here is more in (3). We are interested in IBM's as a\nsimple calculable ensemble of vacua realizing a large variety of gauge groups and matter\ncontents, in which we can study the distribution of various physical features. We follow the\npoint of view advocated in [36], where the problem of counting isolated (or \"stabilized\")\nvacua was set out in a precise way. This work also suggested as a simple Ansatz that\nvarious observables, in particular intersection numbers between pairs of branes, might be\nindependent in ensembles of vacua coming from string theory, and this idea was used\nto estimate the fraction of IBM's realizing the Standard Model gauge group and matter\nrepresentations as somewhere between 10\u221210 and 10\u221220 .\nIn recent works of the Munich group [8, 40] this type of question has been analyzed in\ndetail in the T 6 /Z2 \u00d7 Z2 orientifold. They performed an automated scan over supersymmetric brane configurations satisfying the tadpole conditions, and obtained statistics for\nthe resulting ensemble of models. As we will review, this is essentially a partition problem\ninvolving finding all subsets of a fixed set of vectors which sum to a desired vector. Such\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n\fproblems are typically NP-complete, so that (for general reasons explained in [26]) it is\nunclear that any algorithm can do this much faster than an exhaustive search through a\nlist of candidate models. This requires time which grows faster than any power of the\nnumbers controlling the size of the problem (Betti numbers and the numbers entering the\ntadpole conditions), and indeed the computer search of [8] ran for about a year.\nNow as long as the properties one is searching for are not too rare, this type of intractability can be dealt with by taking a random sample of the total ensemble, and making\nstatistical statements based on this sample. But to interpret such results, it is important\nto have a precise definition of the set being sampled, and an unbiased sample. It is not entirely clear to us whether this is true of the algorithms used in [8, 40], for reasons explained\nin those works and which will review below.\nNevertheless, their analysis led to some interesting observations on the set of models.\nIn particular, they found that features of the intersecting brane model field theory, such as\nhaving a U(N) subgroup or a fixed number of generations of chiral fermions in a particular\nmatter sector, were largely statistically independent. Combining the probabilities for the\ngauge group and number of generations of matter fields, in [40], the hypothesis of independence was used to estimate the fraction of 3 generation Standard Models to be 10\u22129 (or\n\"one in a billion\") in this ensemble.\nIn this paper, we primarily study the same ensemble of intersecting brane models as in\n[8, 40]. Compared to these works, there are a number of differences in our approach. Perhaps the main one is that we have developed algorithms which can in principle enumerate\nall configurations of a specified type, by searching through a finite set of possibilities. The\nmain new ingredients which enable us to do this are an analytic proof that the relevant\nbrane configurations are finite in number, and a priori bounds on the homology classes of\nthe branes which can appear.\nThis is not to say that one can usually do a complete enumeration in practice. For\nthe toroidal examples we consider in detail here, this may be possible, as the number of\nmodels is of order 1010 . However, most ensembles on more general Calabi-Yau manifolds\nwill have many more configurations. Still, there are good reasons to want algorithms which\ncan generate the complete ensemble, such as to be able to do unbiased random sampling.\nAnother difference between this work and [8, 40] is that we focus more closely on\nenumerating IBM's which contain a specified \"visible\" gauge group and charged matter\ncontent, leaving the rest of the model unconstrained (as was done in [31]). We then analyze\nthe structure of the problem within this sector which leads to a specific dependence of the\nnumber of models on the gauge group and matter content. This allows searching for\nStandard Models, and also for other desired structure such as particular supersymmetry\nbreaking gauge theories. It also makes the problem far more tractable computationally.\nWhile the total number of intersecting brane models grows exponentially in a tadpole\nparameter, the number of models with fixed gauge groups grows only polynomially. Of\ncourse, to enumerate all models, one still needs to consider all possibilities; we leave the\nquestion of whether the scan over hidden sectors can be bypassed by estimating their\nmultiplicities for subsequent work.\nA final difference is that we have not gone as far in the detailed construction of Standard\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\n\fModels as [31, 40], for example leaving explicit enumeration of \"tilted tori\" configurations\nfor future work. Rather, besides methodological improvements, we concentrate on getting\ndetailed analytical and numerical estimates. We find estimates for the number of models\nas a function of the gauge group. We find that the number of models with a gauge group\nfactor U (N ) goes as an inverse power of N . We also investigate intersection numbers\nbetween branes, which govern the number of matter fields.\nThe overall picture which emerges from this analysis is that for this particular orientifold, there are a calculable set of intersecting brane models which include a wide range of\nspecified gauge groups and number of generations of chiral matter fields. For the standard\nmodel gauge group and 3 generations, the number of models is on the order of 10. Aside\nfrom the suppression of large generations for large gauge groups, and some mild numbertheoretic enhancement of composite intersection numbers which seems rather model dependent, there does not seem to be any strong correlation between the specific features of\nthe gauge group and matter content. Rather, this class of models seems naturally to give\nrise to an ensemble of string vacua with different gauge groups and different numbers of\ngenerations of matter fields reasonably equally distributed. Our results so far have also\nnot confirmed the interesting claim of [40] that 3 generations (compared to 1, 2 or 4) is\ndisfavored in this ensemble, but it may be that we did not get far enough to see this and\nthat it might come out of a more complete analysis, for example including tilted tori.\nIt is important to note that just because a model class does not \"explain\" or prefer\nthe correct number of generations is not a strong argument against it. An arguably better\napplication of the statistics of vacua is to consider only vacua which fit the known data (the\nStandard Model) and then look at the distribution of predictions among these. Interesting\npredictions which can be made from IBM's include additional charged matter, particularly\nwith exotic gauge quantum numbers, the presence of additional gauge sectors loosely coupled to the SM (which might be useful for supersymmetry breaking), and hidden sectors\n(with purely gravitational coupling to the SM). All of these features appear generic, and\nit would be very useful to know what constraints these additional matter sectors obey. To\nstudy these issues it is important to have a wider class of semi-realistic models containing\nat least the standard model gauge group and the physical number of generations. Towards\nthis end, we include here some discussion of how the analysis of this paper might be generalized to a broader class of Calabi-Yau manifolds, where we might find many more of these\nsemi-realistic models with which to perform further analysis.\nThe structure of this paper is as follows: In Section 2 we study intersecting brane\nmodels on a specific toroidal orientifold with fixed gauge group. We prove that there\nare a finite number of SUSY models with fixed tadpoles and any fixed number of brane\nstacks. We develop analytic estimates of the numbers of such models, which we check using\nnumerical experiment. We develop polynomial time algorithms for generating all models\nwith a fixed gauge group In Section 3 we consider the intersection numbers between brane\nstacks, which describe the numbers of families of matter fields associated with strings\nconnecting the branes. We look at the distribution of intersection numbers in some generic\nclasses of models, and analyze the statistical properties of these distributions. In Section\n4 we discuss the application of our general analysis to more explicit model building, and\n\n\u20134\u2013\n\n\fidentify a pair of new intersecting brane models containing the standard model gauge group\nand 3 generations of chiral matter. In Section 5 we discuss the generalization of type II\nintersecting brane models to a general Calabi-Yau manifold. A similar discussion appears\nin [11].\nOne issue which we do not address in this paper is the problem of including fluxes or\nother effects which stabilize the moduli. The intersecting brane models we consider are only\nisolated points in a larger open string moduli space of supersymmetric brane configurations.\nIn general, moving out into this moduli space corresponds to recombination of branes as\nwell as variation of their world-volume gauge fields. A full analysis requires understanding\nthese moduli spaces, and then stabilization of these moduli. While papers such as [13, 51]\nhave begun to address this question by constructing intersecting brane models including\nNS-NS and R-R fluxes, a systematic and global approach to this problem is still lacking.\nIn section 6, we outline a simple argument which suggests that the number of IBM's (of\na slightly more general type than we consider) could be a good estimate for the number\nof stabilized vacua which would come out of such a full analysis. Again, we leave detailed\nexploration of this idea for future work.\nOur conclusions appear in section 7.\n\n2. Models on the torus with fixed gauge group\nGiven a particular Calabi-Yau and orientifold, there are many brane configurations which\npreserve supersymmetry. In this paper we consider a simplification of the full classification\nproblem for intersecting brane models. We assume that the gauge group is chosen as an\ninput, and we consider the problem of generating all SUSY intersecting brane models with\nthe desired gauge group. The gauge group can either be chosen to completely saturate the\ntadpole, in which case there are no further hidden sectors of the theory, or the gauge group\ncan be chosen to undersaturate the tadpole, leaving room for further \"hidden\" parts of\nthe gauge group which would produce the remaining contribution needed for the tadpole.\nIn our discussion we use the phrase \"hidden\" sector to describe the part of the model\nwhich does not include our gauge group of interest. We do not get into the details of\nphenomenology which would be needed to make one part of the gauge group visible in the\nlow-energy theory.\nAfter some initial discussion of supersymmetric branes on the toroidal orientifold in\n2.1, 2.2, in subsection 2.3 we briefly discuss useful symmetries of the problem. We then\nbegin the substantive analysis in subsection 2.4 by demonstrating that there are a finite\nnumber of distinct solutions to the SUSY equations containing any fixed gauge group.\nIn subsection 2.5 we give estimates for the numbers of brane configurations with certain\nproperties; the results of this somewhat detailed analysis are summarized in subsection 2.6.\nIn subsection 2.7 we give efficient algorithms for generating all SUSY brane models with a\nfixed tadpole and fixed gauge group.\nCompared to previous work, there are two essential new ingredients in our analysis\nand algorithms. The first new ingredient comes from the proof of finiteness, which allows\nus to compute explicit bounds on the range of winding numbers of the branes which can\n\n\u20135\u2013\n\n\fappear. These bounds not only allow us to demonstrate that a given set of solutions is\ncomplete, but also allow us to efficiently scan the space of allowed configurations. The\nsecond new ingredient is to enumerate brane configurations independently of the K\u00e4hler\nmoduli, and then check for each configuration whether it is supersymmetric for some value\nof the moduli; this avoids a time-consuming scan over moduli.\nAs we will show, the number of configurations with a fixed gauge group grows polynomially in the total tadpole number, with a power growing with the number of \"brane\nstacks\" or factors in the gauge group. The search algorithms typically take time which is\ncomparable to the number of configurations; in other words one needs to search through a\nnumber of candidates comparable to the number of solutions. This is essentially the same\nlevel of difficulty as for finding flux vacua, in which the time also scales with the number of\nconfigurations. For example, for IIB flux vacua on a Calabi-Yau with third Betti number\nb3 and D3 tadpole L, the number of vacua grows as (2\u03c0L)b3 /(b3 )! (for L \u226b b3 ) [2, 37], and\nthere is probably no algorithm for finding the interesting ones which is much more efficient\nthan exhaustive search through a large set of candidates. This number of flux vacua grows\npolynomially with a tadpole constraint, while it grows exponentially with the number of\ncycles b3 . The exponential complexity of the general brane problem, on the other hand,\narises from the need to sum over all gauge groups and thus all partitions. While we avoid\nthis particular exponential complexity using the methods of this paper, it is distinct from\nthat which would appear on a more general Calabi-Yau with large Betti numbers bi , where\nagain the number of vacua would grow exponentially in bi . We discuss this issue further in\nSection 5.\nAs we will now describe in more detail, the problem of enumerating all intersecting\nbrane constructions with a fixed gauge group is a polynomial time problem, while counting\nand characterizing the possible hidden sectors is in general exponential. However, we should\nemphasize that in the T 6 /Z22 model, the full range of possible hidden sectors should also\nbe computable due to the size of the numbers involved using the more efficient algorithms\nwe develop here.\n2.1 Supersymmetric branes on the toroidal orientifold\nIn this subsection we quickly review the problem of finding supersymmetric brane configurations in the T 6 /Z22 orientifold. We follow most closely the discussion in [8], but equally\ngood accounts include [19, 9]. Readers unfamiliar with this problem can also skip ahead\nto section 5, where the general setup is reviewed.\nConsidering T 6 as a product of 3 T 2 's with complex coordinates zi , the Z2 actions are\ngiven by (z1 , z2 , z3 ) \u2192 (\u2212z1 , \u2212z2 , z3 ) and (z1 , z2 , z3 ) \u2192 (z1 , \u2212z2 , \u2212z3 ), while the orientifold\naction takes \u03a9 : zi \u2192 z\u0304i . For the subset of branes we consider, mirror symmetry is very\nsimple (it amounts to a triple T -duality), and the IIA and IIB descriptions are equivalent.\nWe are going to use a mixed IIA\u2013IIB language, because while the pictures are simpler\nin the IIA language with wrapped D6-branes, much of the underlying mathematics and\nthe generalization to other Calabi-Yau orientifolds can be described most easily in the IIB\nlanguage.\n\n\u20136\u2013\n\n\fIn IIA language, the supersymmetric branes we consider are D6-branes wrapping flat\nsubmanifolds of T 6 . Such a submanifold can be described by a vector of six winding\nnumbers ni and mi with i \u2208 {1, 2, 3}, defining an embedding from a T 3 with coordinates\n\u03c31 , \u03c32 , \u03c33 ) to T 6 with coordinates (X i , Y i ) as\n\nT3\n\nX i = n i \u03c3i ;\n\nY i = m i \u03c3i .\n\nTo get a one-to-one embedding, the pair of winding numbers (ni , mi ) must be relatively\nprime for each i \u2208 {1, 2, 3}; such a vector is referred to as \"primitive.\" One can check\nthat any such submanifold is invariant under the orbifold action Z22 . The orientifold \u03a9 will\nact as (ni , mi ) \u2192 (ni , \u2212mi ), so a consistent brane configuration is a set of branes which is\ninvariant under \u03a9.\nThe mirror symmetry to IIB operates by T-dualizing the three coordinates Y i . The\nmirror of such a brane then depends on the indices ni . If all are non-zero, one gets a\nD9-brane carrying magnetic flux determined by the indices mi . When any ni are zero, one\ngets lower dimensional wrapped branes. For now, we use IIA notation; the relationship\nbetween these pictures is discussed further in Section 5.\nA supersymmetric brane model consists of a set of brane stacks satisfying a common\nsupersymmetry condition. Each brane stack is parameterized by the number of branes N\nand a set of winding numbers ni , mi , i \u2208 {1, 2, 3}. The real part of the supersymmetry\ncondition is\n0 = m1 m2 m3 \u2212 m1 j2 n2 j3 n3 \u2212 m2 j3 n3 j1 n1 \u2212 m3 j1 n1 j2 n2 .\n(2.1)\nHere, ji > 0 are the K\u00e4hler moduli in the IIB picture, T-dual to complex structure moduli\nin the intersecting brane IIA picture. Each brane stack has an image under \u03a9 where\nn\u2032i = ni , m\u2032i = \u2212mi .\nUsing a to index the distinct brane stacks, not counting images under \u03a9, and denoting\nby T = 8 the bound on the total tadpoles arising from the orientifold, the tadpole conditions\ncan be written as\nX\nX\nX\nX\nSa = T\n(2.2)\nRa =\nQa =\nPa =\na\n\na\n\na\n\na\n\nwhere the individual tadpole contributions from each brane stack are given by\nP = n1 n2 n3\nQ = \u2212n1 m2 m3\n\nR = \u2212m1 n2 m3\n\n(2.3)\n\nS = \u2212m1 m2 n3 .\n\nWith this notation, when all tadpoles are nonvanishing the real part of the SUSY condition\nbecomes\nj\nk\nl\n1\n+ + + = 0.\n(2.4)\nP\nQ R S\nwhere we denote j = j2 j3 , k = j1 j3 , l = j1 j2 . The positivity part of the SUSY condition\nbecomes\n1\n1\n1\n(2.5)\nP + Q + R + S > 0.\nj\nk\nl\n\n\u20137\u2013\n\n\fFinally, there is a further discrete constraint from K-theory which states that when we\nsum over all branes we must have [53]\nX\nX\nX\nX\nm1 m2 m3 \u2261\nm1 n 2 n 3 \u2261\nn 1 m2 n 3 \u2261\nn1 n2 m3 \u2261 0 (mod 2) .\n(2.6)\na\n\na\n\na\n\na\n\nTo summarize, our problem is to find all sets of \"Na -stacks\" of supersymmetric branes,\nwhere Na is a list of positive integers, for all values of the moduli (j, k, l). A supersymmetric\n(a)\n(a)\nbrane for moduli (j, k, l) is specified by a vector winding numbers ni , mi , which satisfy\nthe SUSY conditions (2.4) or (2.1), as well as (2.5) and (2.6). An Na -stack of branes is\na set of supersymmetric branes taken with multiplicities Na , which can be completed by\nadjoining zero or more additional distinct supersymmetric branes (with the same moduli)\nto give a configuration which satisfies Eq. (2.2). These additional branes will be called the\n\"hidden sector\" (note that they might or might not be physically observable in a particular\nmodel).\n2.2 Types of branes\nOur first step in solving this problem will be to classify the set of supersymmetric branes\nwhich are compatible with the positivity condition Eq. (2.5). This set has three components, distinguished by the number of nonzero tadpoles, which we will call the A-branes,\nB-branes and C-branes. They are as follows:\nA) Four nonvanishing tadpoles:\nIn this case all n's and m's are nonzero. Let us categorize the allowed sign possibilities. First, note that changing the signs on any set of 4 winding numbers ni , mi , nj , mj\namounts to an orientation-preserving coordinate redefinition and maps any configuration to one which is physically equivalent. Thus, we can without loss of generality\nchoose signs so that either all n's are positive or we have signs +, +, \u2212. Let us first\nconsider the case that all n's are positive. If we choose all m's positive then (2.4)\nand (2.5) cannot both be satisfied, since only 1/P in (2.4) is positive, and therefore\nP < \u2212Q/j, for example, so the LHS of (2.5) would be negative. Changing signs on\nall mi takes a brane to its image under \u03a9 and leaves the tadpoles invariant, so we can\nassume that all branes contributing in the sum (2.3) with n1 , n2 , n3 > 0 have signs for\nthe mi of + \u2212 \u2212, \u2212 + \u2212, or \u2212 \u2212 +. These three possibilities give tadpole combinations\nwith 3 positive tadpoles and one negative, with Q, R, S respectively negative for the\n3 choices of sign for the m's. Now, assume the n's have the signs + + \u2212. This gives a\nnegative value for P , and to satisfy (2.4) we must have Q, R, S > 0, so without loss\nof generality we have signs + + \u2212 for the m's.\nTo summarize, when all four tadpoles are nonvanishing, 3 must be positive and one\nnegative.\nB) Two nonvanishing tadpoles:\nIn this case just one of the ni , mi vanishes. This leads to two nonvanishing tadpoles\nand two vanishing tadpoles. A similar but simpler argument to that of case a)\n\n\u20138\u2013\n\n\fshows that both nonzero tadpoles must be positive. Various choices of signs and\nwhich winding numbers vanish are possible, giving all 6 possible pairs of nonvanishing\ntadpoles.\nC) One nonvanishing tadpole:\nIn this case at least two of the ni , mi vanish. But if precisely two vanish and there\nis one nonvanishing tadpole then there must also be precisely one nonvanishing term\non the LHS of (2.1), which is impossible. So three winding numbers must vanish. In\nthis case, however, primitivity implies that the nonvanishing winding numbers are all\n1, so that the single nonvanishing tadpole is 1. Branes of this type do not contribute\nat all to (2.1) and thus do not constrain the K\u00e4hler moduli ji . These are referred to\nas \"filler\" branes in some of the literature.\n2.3 Symmetries\nIn this subsection we discuss the symmetries of the equations (2.4) and (2.5). We discussed\nabove the symmetries of the n's and m's which map every brane configuration to a physically equivalent configuration. Changing signs on all m's corresponds to switching branes\nunder the action of the orientifold \u03a9. Changing signs on a pair of n's and the same pair\nof m's corresponds to an orientation-preserving coordinate change on the D-branes in the\nsystem. We use these symmetries to choose canonical forms for the values of n and m in\nbrane configurations.\nThere is a further set of symmetries which acts on the set of solutions of (2.4), (2.5).\nThis set of symmetries takes one solution to a distinct solution with different tadpoles.\nThe obvious part of this set of symmetries arises from permutations on the 3 copies of T 2 ,\nassociated with the 6 permutations on the indices i. These symmetries also act on the\ntadpoles Q, R, S through the same permutation, and permute the moduli j, k, l in the same\nway.\nThis order 6 symmetry group can be extended further to include arbitrary permutations on all four tadpoles P, Q, R, S. The symmetry operation which exchanges P with one\nof the other four tadpoles corresponds to 90 degree rotations on two of the tori\nni \u2192 mi \u2192 \u2212ni\n\n(2.7)\n\nnj \u2192 mj \u2192 \u2212nj .\nTo extend this symmetry to the moduli j, k, l, we can write these moduli over a common\ndenominator, j \u2192 j/h, k \u2192 k/h, l \u2192 l/h, and then the permutation simply acts on the\nparameters h, j, k, l. When the original j, k, l are rational, we can replace the moduli with\n4 integer parameters h, j, k, l.\nThis symmetry group corresponds to choices of coordinates on the original T 6 . We will\nfind it useful to use this symmetry of the equations to simplify the discussion and analysis\nin several places in the remainder of the paper.\n2.4 Proof of finiteness\nIn this subsection we prove that the number of models on the T 6 /Z22 orientifold with a\nfixed number of brane stacks is finite. This implies among other things that the number\n\n\u20139\u2013\n\n\fof models with any fixed gauge group is finite. In this subsection, and in the following\nsubsections where we estimate the number of models with certain properties, we leave the\ntotal tadpole T as variable, though in the physical application for the given orbifold we\nhave T = 8.\nAll the difficulty in proving finiteness arises from the A-type branes which can contribute negatively to Eq. (2.2). If we have only type B and C branes, it is immediately\nclear that there are a finite number of possible ways to saturate Eq. (2.2), since each brane\nstack with a winding number of absolute value N or more contributes at least N to some\ntadpole. Thus, we must have all winding numbers \u2264 T , which can be done in a finite\nnumber of ways, and we must have \u2264 4T brane stacks and images from that finite set of\nallowed brane stacks.\nThe analysis with the A-type branes must involve the supersymmetry conditions in\nan essential way, since one can find infinite sets of stacks by combining branes which are\nsupersymmetric for different moduli [49].\nWe clearly cannot have an infinite family with only one A-type brane, since in an\ninfinite family some winding number must be unbounded. This winding number contributes\nto two nonzero tadpoles, so with only one A-type brane it must contribute an unbounded\npositive amount to some tadpole which cannot be canceled by a negative contribution. This\nis a contradiction, so any infinite family must have more than one A-type brane. For the\nsame reason, we cannot have an infinite family where only one tadpole takes unbounded\nvalues.\nNow, let us consider the possibility of an infinite family where two tadpoles take\nunbounded values. Without loss of generality, let's assume these are the tadpoles R and\nS. Assume there are r A-type branes with tadpoles which are negative for R, and s\nA-type branes with negative S tadpoles. In the first case the tadpoles can be written\nR = \u2212ai \u03bdi , S = bi \u03bdi , i = 1, . . . , r where for each brane \u03bd = |m1 |, a = n2 |m3 |, and b = n3 m2 .\nIn the second case the tadpoles can be similarly written R = a\u2032i \u03bci , S = \u2212b\u2032i \u03bci . Because\nthe other tadpoles are bounded, we have 0 \u2264 ai , bi , a\u2032i , b\u2032i \u2264 B for each i, where the upper\nbound is B = T 2 unless there are other branes with negative P or Q tadpoles. If there\nare an infinite family of configurations with a fixed number of branes and a fixed bound\nB, then there must also be an infinite number with some fixed combination of values for\nai . . . b\u2032i , so let us take these values as fixed. For these fixed values, the SUSY condition for\nthe configuration with the smallest tadpoles tells us that there is a ratio \u03bb = l/k such that\nbi > \u03bbai ,\n\na\u2032i > b\u2032i /\u03bb .\n\n(2.8)\n\nBut now let us use this \u03bb for the full infinite family and compute for each member of the\nfamily the sum\nX\nX\n(bi \u2212 \u03bbai )\u03bdi +\n\u03bb(a\u2032i \u2212 b\u2032i /\u03bb)\u03bci = T (\u03bb + 1) .\n(2.9)\n\nOn the one hand, the RHS is fixed. But on the other hand, the LHS is a sum over linear\nterms in the \u03bdi , \u03bci with fixed positive coefficients. So there cannot be solutions of this\nequation with arbitrarily large \u03bdi or \u03bci and therefore there cannot be an infinite number\nof configurations where two tadpoles are unbounded and negative.\n\n\u2013 10 \u2013\n\n\fSo we see that any infinite family of brane stack configurations solving the SUSY\nequations with a fixed number of stacks must have configurations with at least three Atype branes and at least 3 of the tadpoles Q, R, S, T must be negative and unbounded on\na sequence of A-branes. We now proceed to prove that this situation also cannot occur.\nLet us consider the sum over all A-type branes\nX\n\nPa +\n\na\n\n1X\n1X\n1 1 1\n1X\nQa +\nRa +\nSa \u2264 T (1 + + + ) .\nj a\nk a\nl a\nj\nk\nl\n\n(2.10)\n\nFor each a, there is one negative tadpole, so the contribution for that a to the sum can\nbe written using the equation (2.4) as, for example,\n\"\n#\nQ a Ra\n1\nPa +\n+ ***\n(2.11)\n+\n\u2212 1\nj\nk\nj\nk\nPa + Qa + Ra\nwhen Sa < 0 and similar expressions when one of the other tadpoles is negative.\nBut we can then use the elementary inequality\n1 1 1\n3\n+ + >\nx y z\nx+y+z\n\n(2.12)\n\nto show that\nX\n\nPa +\n\na+\n\n1X\n1X\n3\n1 1 1\n1X\nQa +\nRa +\nSa \u2264 T (1 + + + ) ,\nj a+\nk a+\nl a+\n2\nj\nk\nl\n\n(2.13)\n\nwhere for each tadpole we only sum over positive contributions to that tadpole.\nNow, using the symmetries discussed in the previous subsection, let us assume without\nloss of generality that 1 \u2264 j \u2264 k \u2264 l. We then have an upper bound\nX\nPa \u2264 6T .\n(2.14)\na+\n\nSo we see that the sum of all positive P tadpoles is bounded above and therefore also\nthat the negative tadpoles are bounded below by a limit proportional to the total tadpole\nnumber T .\nWe can now repeat this argument for Q. We have\n1X\n1X\n1X\n1 1 1\nQa +\nRa +\nSa \u2264 T ( + + ) .\nj a\nk a\nl a\nj\nk\nl\nUsing the inequality\n\nwe then have\n\nso again\n\n1 1\n2\n+ >\nx y\nx+y\n\n1X\n1X\n1 1 1\n1X\nQa +\nRa +\nSa \u2264 2T ( + + ) ,\nj a+\nk a+\nl a+\nj\nk\nl\nX\na+\n\nQa \u2264 6T .\n\n\u2013 11 \u2013\n\n(2.15)\n\n(2.16)\n\n(2.17)\n\n(2.18)\n\n\fThus, we see that two of the tadpoles are bounded in any infinite family, so there\ncannot be any infinite family where 3 tadpoles become unbounded. But the first part of\nthe argument then shows that there cannot be any infinite families, since there cannot be\nany infinite families with only two unbounded tadpoles.\nCombining these arguments, we see that any class of configuration with a definite\nnumber of stacks and thus a definite number of factors in the gauge group, contains finitely\nmany configurations. To complete the argument that the total number of brane configurations is finite, we need to see that the number of factors in the gauge group is also bounded.\nThis follows because the bounds we just obtained on the winding numbers do not depend\non the number of stacks (beyond three). Thus the number of distinct supersymmetric\nbranes is finite, and since each stack must contain a different supersymmetric brane, the\nnumber of possible stacks is finite.\n2.5 Estimates\nWe can now use the analysis of the previous subsection to develop estimates for the numbers\nof brane configurations containing a particular gauge group and algorithms for enumerating\nthese configurations.\nFirst, because of the existence of the filler (type C) branes, any configuration which\nundersaturates each of the total tadpole constraints Eq. (2.2), can be completed to a configuration satisfying Eq. (2.2) by adding C-branes, in a unique way. Thus, the bulk of the\nproblem amounts to enumerating Na -stacks of A- and B-type branes satisfying\nX\nX\nX\nX\nSa \u2264 T.\n(2.19)\nRa \u2264 T ;\nQa \u2264 T ;\nPa \u2264 T ;\na\n\na\n\na\n\na\n\nIn general, there are other configurations as well. First, part or all of the specified\ngauge group can be realized by C-type branes. These configurations are easy to get (of\ncourse one should keep in mind that adding further C-branes to saturate the tadpole will\nchange the gauge group). Second, some configurations which violate Eq. (2.19) can be\ncompleted to satisfy Eq. (2.2), by adding hidden sector A-branes. We will neglect this\npossibility to start, and discuss A-type branes in the hidden sector later.\nAs we discussed earlier, there are straightforward bounds on the types and numbers of\nB- and C-type branes which can add up to a specified set of tadpoles. The difficulty is with\nthe A-branes. One way to deal with them, which was taken in [40], is to scan over values\nof the moduli (j, k, l). It follows immediately from (2.5) that the set of supersymmetric\nbranes for any fixed moduli is finite. The problem with this approach is that one must then\nscan over all values of the moduli. Since the moduli need not be integers, this scan is far\nmore difficult than the original problem. One might bring in number-theoretic arguments\nto bound the heights of the moduli, along the lines of [27], but this does not look easy.\nA different approach, which we will follow here, is to find a priori bounds on the numbers and types of A-branes which can appear, which are independent of the moduli. We\nthen enumerate all Na -stacks, and then check for each whether all branes can simultaneously satisfy the condition Eq. (2.1) (note that we already found the general solutions to\nEq. (2.5)). Since the equations Eq. (2.4) for A-branes are linear in the moduli (j, k, l),\n\n\u2013 12 \u2013\n\n\fas are Eq. (2.1) for B-branes, finding the moduli which solve them is an easy problem in\nlinear algebra. We then keep only the configurations for which (j, k, l) are all positive.\nThis is a good approach if the fraction of all brane configurations (satisfying our a\npriori bounds) which turn out to be supersymmetric is not too small. For models with up\nto three stacks on T 6 /Z22 , the equations Eq. (2.1) will always have solutions, of which a\nlarge fraction (more than 1/23 ) turn out to be acceptable, so this approach works well.\nOn the other hand, if the number of brane stacks is greater than b2 (the number\nof moduli, here 3), then the equations Eq. (2.1) are overdetermined, and this will be a\nproblem. In this case, one could try a hybrid approach, in which one singles out a subset\nof b2 brane stacks, enumerates all of these, and then completes each of these configurations\nby adjoining further brane stacks chosen to respect supersymmetry at the same (known)\nvalues of the moduli. However we will not need this approach here.\nWe now proceed by systematically analyzing the classes of models with one, two,\nand three stacks which undersaturate all tadpoles, discussing as we progress the effects\nof increasing numbers of A-type branes on the statistics. The upshot of this analysis\nis summarized in the last subsection of this section. Basically, we will find that when\nconsidering configurations of up to 3 brane stacks, a stack of Nb B-branes can be included\nin T 4 /Nb2 ways, while a stack of Na A-branes can be included in T 3 /Na3 ways. The reader\nnot interested in the detailed arguments may wish to skip directly to subsection 2.6.\n2.5.1 One-stack models\nWe begin our analysis by looking at how many different individual stacks of N branes\nundersaturate all tadpoles. As noted above, this does not tell us about all possible individual brane stacks which might appear as part of a model, due to the possibility of hidden\nA-type branes. This analysis, however, will get us going and indicate the nature of the\nproblem we are considering. (Note that this does, however, give all possible individual\nbrane stacks which can appear where all possible hidden-sector branes are type B or filler\ntype C branes.) We begin by considering single branes (stacks with N = 1), and at the\nend of subsection describe the changes needed to incorporate larger values of N .\nAs discussed in 2.3 there are symmetries which permute the four tadpoles P, Q, R, S.\nThus, we can simplify our analysis by putting the models we are interested in in canonical\nform. For a single brane this is particularly simple. We consider the three types of brane\nin turn\nC: All possible type C branes are equivalent to the brane\n(P, Q, R, S) = (1, 0, 0, 0)\n(n1 , n2 , n3 ) = (1, 1, 1)\n\n(2.20)\n\n(m1 , m2 , m3 ) = (0, 0, 0) .\n\nSo up to symmetries there is a single type C brane.\nB: All type B branes can be put in the form\n(0, 0, R, S) = (0, 0, pr, qs)\n(n1 , n2 , n3 ) = (0, p, q)\n\n(m1 , m2 , m3 ) = (1, \u2212r, \u2212s) .\n\n\u2013 13 \u2013\n\n(2.21)\n\n\fwhere R \u2264 S and p, q, r, s > 0. (when R = S we impose p \u2264 q.) The number of solutions\nof (2.21) in integers p, q, r, s with R \u2264 S \u2264 T is approximately given by\nX X\n\nS\u2264T R\u2264S\n\n1\nd(R)d(S) \u223c T 2 (ln T )2\n2\n\n(2.22)\n\nP\nwhere d(N ) is the number of divisors of N , and we have used N d(N ) \u223c N ln N . The\nsymmetry exchanging P and Q is given by (2.8) with i, j = 2, 3; this exchanges p with r and\nq with s along with some sign changes. Choosing a canonical form for each allowed brane\nreduces the number of distinct branes by another factor of 2. Thus, (2.22) gives a bound\non the rate of growth of the number of individual type B branes which undersaturate all\ntadpoles\n1\nNb (T ) / T 2 (ln T )2 .\n(2.23)\n4\nBecause of the primitivity condition, we must impose the further condition (p, q) = (r, s) =\n1. This modifies the sum (2.22) to\nNb (T ) \u223c\n\n\u0012 \u0013\n1 X T T \u03c6(r) \u03c6(s)\nT 2 (ln T )2\n1 6 2 2\nT (ln T )2\n\u223c\n=\n4\nr s r\ns\n4\u03b6(2)2\n4 \u03c02\n\n(2.24)\n\nr,s\u2264T\n\nwhere \u03c6(n) is the Euler totient function giving the number of integers < n which are\nP \u2212s\nrelatively prime to n and \u03b6(s) is the zeta function \u03b6(s) =\nn . A brief summary of\nthe relevant features of the totient and zeta functions are given in Appendix A. The zeta\nfunction changes the overall constant to include the relative primality condition when\nsumming over powers of various sets of integers, but does not change the scaling of the\noverall sum. In Figure 1 we plot the (log of the) upper bound (2.23) and the improved\nestimate (2.24) against the exact number of type B branes for general values of T . At\nT = 8 the bound gives 69.19, while the precise number of type b branes is Nb (8) = 71, and\nthe estimate (2.24) gives 42.06. Note that for small values of T the approximate bound\n(2.23) and the improved estimate (2.24) are exceeded because of configurations such as\nthose with R = S, p = q, which are unchanged under some of the permutation symmetries.\nP\nThe estimate (2.24) is also poor for small T , since n<N \u03c6(n)/n2 \u2192 ln N/\u03b6(2) converges\nto the asymptotic form slowly. Thus, we see that for type B branes the precise asymptotic\nform including number theoretic features is actually less reliable at the small physical value\nT = 8 than the rough estimate which ignores number theoretic subtleties. We continue\nto fix coefficients in this section including relative primality constraints, but in subsequent\nsections we will primarily concern ourselves with the main power law scaling of different\nkinds of branes.\nA: Now, let us consider type A branes. These can always be put in the form (\u2212P, Q, R, S)\nfor positive P and 0 < Q \u2264 R \u2264 S \u2264 T . (As above, when tadpoles are equal we order on\nthe corresponding n's, and if these are equal we order on m to put the branes in canonical\norder; we choose all n, m positive except n3 , m3 as in the discussion of Section 2.2.) The\ntadpole constraint puts an upper bound on the positive tadpoles Q, R, S.

The correction at large T to the upper bound (2.26)\ncomes only from the relatively prime condition. This correction can be incorporated by\nreplacing\nX \u03c6(n)\n\u03c02 X 1\n\u03c02\n=\n\u2192\n=\n(2.27)\n6\nn2\nn3\n6\u03b6(3)\nn\nn\n\nWe graph the actual number of type A branes which satisfy the primitivity condition\nagainst the upper bound (2.26) and the estimate (2.27) in Figure 2. For T = 8, the bound\ngives 379.81, and the estimate gives 218.67, while the actual number of configurations is 226.\nP\nIn this case, because the sum\n1/n2 converges quickly, the number theoretic corrections\n\u2013 15 \u2013\n\n\f10\n\n8\n\nln N(T)\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\nApproximate bound\nImproved estimate\nExact N (T)\n-2\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\n20\n\nT\n\nFigure 2: (Log of) number of type A branes for varying T\n\nare correctly incorporated at a much smaller value of T so that the estimate including these\ncorrections is very close. Again, the approximate bound and the estimate are exceeded for\nsmall T because of symmetric configurations (like n, m = (1, k, k), (1, \u22121, \u22121)); in this case,\nhowever, the bound rapidly exceeds the actual number even for small T because the sum\nin (2.26) is finite for finite T , and because for small finite T the number of allowed ni is\ngiven by \u230aT /(mj mk )\u230b, which is generally smaller than T /(mj mk ).\nWe have now described in a systematic way how to estimate the number of single\nbranes which undersaturate all the tadpole constraints, for each type of brane which can\noccur in this orientifold. To generalize the discussion to a stack of N branes, we simply\ntake the formulae we have found above and replace T \u2192 T /N , since the tadpoles from N\ncopies of a given brane B are just N times the tadpoles of B.\nThus, we see that the number of stacks of N type B branes which undersaturate all\ntadpoles goes as\n9T 2 (ln T /N )2\n(2.28)\nNN b \u223c\n\u03c04 N 2\nwhile the number of stacks of N type A branes which undersaturate all tadpoles goes as\nNN a \u223c\n\n\u03c06T 3\n.\n64 (\u03b6(3)3 N 3\n\n\u2013 16 \u2013\n\n(2.29)\n\n\fEven for N = 1, 2, with T = 8 these numbers are quite small. For example, with T = 8, N =\n2 we have N2a = 33, which is close to 1/23 of the 226 found at N = 1, and reasonably close\nto the estimate (2.29), which gives 27.33, despite the small numbers involved. As discussed\nabove, however, the presence of more type A branes introduces more negative tadpoles and\nmakes it possible for many other individual branes to appear as part of combinations. The\nanalysis in the case of multiple stacks can carried out in a very similar way to the analysis\nof this subsection, though the details are more subtle. We describe multiple stacks in more\ndetail in the following subsections.\n2.5.2 Two brane stacks\nWe now consider the case of two distinct brane stacks. In this section we will just be\nconcerned with determining the power in T with which different brane combinations scale,\ndropping constant and log factors. These factors could be included by a more careful\nanalysis. As in 2.5.1, we begin by considering individual branes and then consider stacks\nof multiple branes.\nAC, BC, CC: The case where one brane is type C is straightforward, as type C branes\ndo not constrain the moduli and contribute to only a single tadpole. Up to symmetries, a\npair of type C branes can appear in two ways, either contributing to the same tadpole or\ndifferent tadpoles. Thus, the number of CC type branes is a constant\nNcc(T ) = 2 .\n\n(2.30)\n\nGiven a type A or type B brane, generically all symmetries are broken, and generically\ntadpoles are not saturated, so there are simply 4 ways to add a type C brane. So asymptotically the number of AC and BC combinations just go as 4 times the number of individual\nA and B branes. Dropping constants and log factors,\nNbc (T ) \u223c O(T 2 )\n\n(2.31)\n\nNac (T ) \u223c O(T 3 ) .\n\n(2.32)\n\nand\nIf we consider a stack of N type C branes and a stack of M type B branes, there is\nno constraint on the type B branes allowed if the stacks contribute to different tadpoles.\nSo the number of M b +N c combinations goes as (assuming M, N \u2264 T )\n\u0012 2\u0013\nT\n.\n(2.33)\nNM b+N c (T ) \u223c O\nM2\nThe situation is slightly more interesting for a combination of type A and type C branes.\nAs we discussed above, a generic stack of M type A branes has tadpoles which scale as\nM (\u2212P, Q, R, S) \u223c (\u2212T 3 /M 2 , T, T, T ) ,\n\n(2.34)\n\nso we can combine this with a stack of N type C branes for any N \u2264 T 3 /M 2 . Thus, there\nare order\n\u0012 3\u0013\nT\nNM a+N c (T ) \u223c O\n(2.35)\nM3\n\n\u2013 17 \u2013\n\n\fcombinations of M A branes and N C branes, with N allowed up to T 3 /M 2 .\nBB: A pair of B-type branes is straightforward. Two B-type branes can appear with the\nfollowing four combinations of nonvanishing tadpoles, up to symmetries\n(P, Q, 0, 0) + (P \u2032 , Q\u2032 , 0, 0)\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n(2.36)\n\n(P, Q, 0, 0) + (P , 0, R , 0)\n\n(2.37)\n\n(P, Q, 0, 0) + (P \u2032 , 0, 0, S \u2032 )\n\n(2.38)\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n(P, Q, 0, 0) + (0, 0, R , S ) .\n\n(2.39)\n\nOn the one hand, any combination of B-type branes which can appear individually can be\ncombined in the form (2.39) so the number of BB combinations is at least as large as the\nsquare of (2.24). But on the other hand, with any of these combinations, each individual\nbrane must be one we considered in the group estimated in (2.24), so the total number of\nBB combinations is bounded above by a small constant factor times (2.24) squared. Thus,\nNbb (T ) \u223c O(T 4 ) .\n\n(2.40)\n\nIt is actually straightforward to show that, more precisely, Nbb (T ) \u223c 3/(4\u03b6(2)4 )T 4 (ln T )4 .\nFollowing the same analysis, the number of ways in which a pair of stacks of N, M B\ntype branes can be combined goes as\n\u0012 2\n\u0013\nT\nT2\nNM b+N b (T ) \u223c O\n*\n,\n(2.41)\nM2 N2\nwhere the two factors represent the ways in which the M and N stacks can be individually\nrealized.\nAB: Now we consider combining an A brane with a B brane. Here the story becomes\nmore interesting. As in our discussion of AC combinations, because the A brane can have\ntadpoles which scale as\n(\u2212P, Q, S, R) \u223c (\u2212T 3 , T, T, T )\n(2.42)\nwe can include type B branes with tadpoles of order\n(P \u2032 , Q\u2032 , 0, 0) \u223c (T 3 , T )\n\n(2.43)\n\n(and similar B branes with nonvanishing tadpoles P \u2032 , R\u2032 and P \u2032 , S \u2032 ) The analysis of the\nnumber of B branes with tadpoles of this order proceeds just as in the discussion leading\nto (2.23), but now the number of possible branes goes as T 4 (ln T )2 . It is straightforward\nto check that for any such AB combination there is a set of moduli j, k, l which satisfy the\nSUSY equations (2.1) for both branes. The B brane in (2.43) has m1 = 0, so the tadpole\ncondition (2.1) just constrains the ratio of moduli k/l. Putting the tadpoles from the A\nbrane into (2.4) we see that k, l can always be taken to be sufficiently small that there is\na solution for j, for any ratio k/l. A similar argument holds for the other sets of order T 4\nB branes. Thus, the number of AB combinations goes as (dropping the logs)\nNab (T ) \u223c O(T 7 ) .\n\n\u2013 18 \u2013\n\n(2.44)\n\n\fNote that there are also order T 5 configurations where the B brane contributes to two of\nthe tadpoles Q, S, R, but these are subleading and we will drop them.\nThe number of ways in which stacks of M type A branes and N type B branes can\nbe combined can similarly be computed to be\nNM a+N b (T ) \u223c O(\n\nT7\n),\nN 2M 5\n\n(2.45)\n\nwhere the extra factor of 1/M 2 appears as an extra suppression factor on the number of\nB branes because of the P tadpole in (2.34).\nAt this point we see explicitly the phenomenon mentioned above, that inclusion of\nadditional type A branes can increase the number of ways a given combination of stacks\ncan be realized. While the number of individual type B branes which undersaturate all\ntadpoles goes as T 2 , in the presence of a stack of type A branes, there are T 4 type B\nbranes which may appear. A more complete discussion of this effect is given in subsection\n2.5.4.\nAA: We now consider the case of two (stacks of) A-type branes. This case is more\ncomplicated because each brane can have a different negative tadpole. (The number of\ncombinations where both branes have the same negative tadpole just goes as Na2 \u2248 T 6 .)\nWe can, up to symmetries, choose the two branes to have tadpoles1\n(\u2212P, Q, R, S) = (\u2212a\u03bd, b\u03bd, m1 n2 m3 , m1 m2 n3 )\n\n(2.46)\n\n(P \u2032 , \u2212Q\u2032 , R\u2032 , S \u2032 ) = (a\u2032 \u03bd \u2032 , \u2212b\u2032 \u03bd, m\u20321 n\u20322 m\u20323 , m\u20321 m\u20322 n\u20323 )\n\n(2.47)\n\nwhere a = n2 n3 , b = m2 m3 , \u03bd = n1 and similarly for the primed variables. This now fits\ndirectly into the context of the proof of finiteness for configurations with two negative\ntadpoles in (2.4). From the SUSY condition we must have\nb\nb\u2032\n> \u2032\na\na\nBecause of the bound (2.9), we must have\n(b \u2212 \u03bba)\u03bd + \u03bb(a\u2032 \u2212 b\u2032 /\u03bb)\u03bd \u2032 \u2264 T (\u03bb + 1)\n\n(2.48)\n\n(2.49)\n\nfor any \u03bb such that b/a > \u03bb > b\u2032 /a\u2032 . Since a, b, a\u2032 , b\u2032 \u2264 T, this bounds the number of\npossible values of \u03bd, \u03bd \u2032 which can satisfy (2.49).\nLet us now compute the number of possible values of \u03bd \u2032 and \u03bd compatible with the\nSUSY conditions for a fixed set of values a, b, a\u2032 , b\u2032 . The two individual tadpole conditions\nare\nb\u03bd \u2212 b\u2032 \u03bd \u2032 \u2264 T,\na\u2032 \u03bd \u2032 \u2212 a\u03bd \u2264 T .\n(2.50)\n\nBecause a\u2032 /a > b\u2032 /b, along with \u03bd \u2032 , \u03bd > 0 these inequalities define a convex quadrilateral\nregion in the \u03bd \u2032 , \u03bd plane whose boundary has vertices\n(0, 0)\n(0, T /b)\n1\n\n(T /a\u2032 , 0)\n\u0013\n\u0012\na\u2032 + b\u2032\na+b\nT,\nT .\na\u2032 b \u2212 ab\u2032 a\u2032 b \u2212 ab\u2032\n\n(2.51)\n\nIn this argument only, we are using different sign conventions mi , ni > 0 from elsewhere in the paper.\n\n\u2013 19 \u2013\n\n\fWe can use this quadrilateral both to estimate the number of allowed AA brane combinations, and to determine the largest tadpoles allowed for P, Q\u2032 .\nNow, let us consider the ways in which a, b, a\u2032 , b\u2032 can be chosen. Choosing m1 > 1\nessentially reduces T \u2192 T /m1 in the selection of a, b, . . . which leads to suppression by a\nfactor of m21 , so the most general configurations will have m1 = m\u20321 = 1, with other values\nof m1 , m\u20321 just giving rise to an overall constant factor of \u03b6(2)2 . We will not be extremely\ncareful about constant terms but will just keep around the obvious ones to get a heuristic\npicture of the overall constant coefficient. Next, we can sum over all n2 , n3 \u2264 T and then\nall m2 \u2264 T /n3 and m3 \u2264 T /n2 , and similarly for the primed variables. This will lead to\non the order of T 4 (ln T )4 possibilities. The constraint (2.48) gives another constant factor\nof 1/2.\nAt this point let us consider three cases:\ni) b/a > b\u2032 /a\u2032 > 1\nii) b/a > 1 > b\u2032 /a\u2032\niii) 1 > b/a > b\u2032 /a\u2032\nIn each of these cases, a\u2032 b > ab\u2032 . Let us first assume that the difference is of the\nsame order as the larger term, a\u2032 b \u2212 ab\u2032 \u223c a\u2032 b, so that we can drop the smaller term in\ncomputations. In this approximation, we find the following leading terms for the tadpoles\nof the two branes in the three cases:\ni) Here\n\nab\u2032\nb\u2032\nT\n<\nT,\nQ\n=\nb\u03bd\n\u223c\n\u2264 T2\n(2.52)\na\u2032 b\na\u2032\nwhere we have used b\u2032 a\u2032 \u2264 T 2 . Similarly for P \u2032 , Q\u2032 , so the largest tadpoles possible in this\ncase are\nP = a\u03bd \u223c\n\n(\u2212P, Q, R, S) \u223c (\u2212T, T 3 , T, T )\n\n(2.53)\n\n(P \u2032 , \u2212Q\u2032 , R\u2032 , S \u2032 ) \u223c (T, \u2212T 3 , T, T ) .\nii) A similar analysis shows that the largest tadpoles possible here are\n(\u2212P, Q, R, S) \u223c (\u2212T, T, T, T )\n\n(2.54)\n\n(P \u2032 , \u2212Q\u2032 , R\u2032 , S \u2032 ) \u223c (T, \u2212T, T, T ) .\niii) In this case the largest tadpoles possible are\n(\u2212P, Q, R, S) \u223c (\u2212T 3 , T, T, T )\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n(2.55)\n\n3\n\n(P , \u2212Q , R , S ) \u223c (T , \u2212T, T, T ) .\nIn this analysis we have assumed that a\u2032 b \u2212 ab\u2032 \u223c a\u2032 b, dropping the second term. The\nexact area of the quadrilateral (2.51) is\na\nb\u2032\n1\n(1\n+\n+\n)T 2 .\na\u2032 b \u2212 ab\u2032\n2b 2a\u2032\n\n\u2013 20 \u2013\n\n(2.56)\n\n\fThis is a measure of the number of \u03bd, \u03bd \u2032 's which are allowed for fixed a, b, a\u2032 , b\u2032 . We see\nthat in case ii the term in parentheses is dominated by 1, and since generically aa\u2032 bb\u2032 \u223c T 2\nand a\u2032 b > ab\u2032 the area generically in this case is order 1 or less. In cases i and iii we have\na term in parentheses which can be as large as T 2 . Thus, we expect of order T 2 possible\n\u03bd, \u03bd \u2032 's in these cases. These numbers of \u03bd, \u03bd \u2032 's correspond to the numbers of ways we can\nchoose the extra factors for the P, Q tadpoles in (2.53-2.55). From this analysis we expect\ncases i and iii to dominate, with another constant factor of 1/2 to select these cases.\nFinally, however, we must look at the denominator term a\u2032 b\u2212 ab\u2032 in (2.56). Generically\nwe expect that this number will be distributed fairly uniformly amongst numbers of order\nT 2 . For roughly 1/T 2 of configurations this denominator will take the value 1. For these\nspecial configurations, the range of possible values for \u03bd, \u03bd \u2032 each get an extra factor of\nT 2 . For these configurations, we can read off the maximum values for the tadpoles, which\nbecome in case iii\n(\u2212P, Q, R, S) \u223c (\u2212T 5 , T 3 , T, T )\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n5\n\n(2.57)\n\n3\n\n(P , \u2212Q , R , S ) \u223c (T , \u2212T , T, T ) .\nNote, however, that the maximum values of these tadpoles, and the largest value of (2.56)\nwill only arise when a, a\u2032 \u223c T 2 , b, b\u2032 \u223c 1. In this case m2 , m3 , m\u20322 , m\u20323 \u223c 1 and the log factors\nare dropped when computing the number of possible a, a\u2032 's, but we probably get another\nlog from the b\u2032 in the denominator of the a\u2032 /2b\u2032 in parentheses in (2.56). We thus expect\nthat the number of configurations of this type will go as the number of a, a\u2032 , b, b\u2032 's (\u223c T 4 ),\nmultiplied by the frequency with which a\u2032 b \u2212 ab\u2032 = 1 (\u223c 1/T 2 ), multiplied by the number\nof possible \u03bd, \u03bd \u2032 's (T 4 ) for an overall result of T 6 (ln T )4 . When a\u2032 b \u2212 ab\u2032 = 2, we have a\nsimilar phenomenon but now the area (2.56) gets an additional factor of 1/2. Summing\nover all values, we expect an additional log. A similar number of configurations should be\npossible in case i, while the number of configurations of case ii is suppressed by T 2 .\nSumming up the discussion, we expect that the number of AA brane combinations\nshould go (up to some slop in the overall constant, and perhaps also in the power of the\nlog) as\nNaa (T ) \u223c O(T 6 ) .\n(2.58)\nA rough estimate of the constant coefficient and powers of logs suggests that this should\ngo more precisely as something like \u03b6(2)2 (ln T )2 /32. These factors should not be taken\ntoo seriously except to note that the overall constant is small; combined with the logs this\ngives a factor of roughly 0.16 at T = 4.\nIncorporating the dependence on stack sizes is slightly more subtle in this case. In the\ntotal number of combinations of N A-stacks of one kind and M A-stacks of another kind,\nthere may be several terms in which have different scalings. We should have an overall\nsuppression by at least N 2 M 2 since ab is suppressed by N 2 and a\u2032 b\u2032 is suppressed by M 2 .\nFurthermore, the overall power of N, M in the denominator must match the power of T in\nthe numerator, so we have schematically\n\u0013\n\u0012\nT6\nP2 (1/N, 1/M )\n(2.59)\nNM a+N a (T ) \u223c O\nN 2M 2\n\n\u2013 21 \u2013\n\n\fwhere P2 (1/N, 1/M ) is a homogeneous polynomial of degree 2 in its arguments.\nIn the case we have considered here the values of one negative tadpole can be as low\nas \u2212O(T 5 ), when the scaling of the tadpoles goes as in (2.57). We have checked this result\nnumerically and found agreement; note however that the coefficient in front of the T 5 is\nsomething like 1/32, since the largest possible value of a \u223c a\u2032 goes as T 2 /4. For T = 8, the\nmost negative tadpole allowed is P = \u2212792.\nIt is also of interest to consider how large the total tadpole from the two AA branes\ncan be. We note first that only one total tadpole (at most) can be negative. Indeed, if\nboth were negative we would need to have a > a\u2032 , b\u2032 > b which contradicts b/a > b\u2032 /a\u2032 .\nNow let us ask how negative that negative tadpole can be. Assume we are in case iii,\nso a > b, a\u2032 > b\u2032 . Then we want a lower bound on the (possibly negative) total tadpole\na\u2032 \u03bd \u2032 \u2212 a\u03bd. From (2.50) we see that\n\u03bd\u2264\n\nT + b\u2032 \u03bd \u2032\na\n\u21d2 a\u03bd \u2264 T + a\u2032 \u03bd \u2032\nb\nb\n\n(2.60)\n\nfrom which it follows\n\na\n\u2265 \u2212T 3 .\n(2.61)\nb\nThus, while the individual tadpoles can scale as (2.57), the sum of the two tadpoles must\nscale as\n(P \u2032 \u2212 P, Q \u2212 Q\u2032 , R + R\u2032 , S + S \u2032 ) \u223c (\u2212T 3 , T, T, T )\n(2.62)\na\u2032 \u03bd \u2032 \u2212 a\u03bd \u2265 \u2212T\n\nor just the same as a single A-type brane. We will find this result useful in our further\nanalysis of more complicated configurations.\nTo summarize the results of our analysis, in this subsection we have shown that the\nnumbers of BB, AB, and AA combinations of brane stacks which admit some common\nK\u00e4hler moduli and which undersaturate all the tadpole conditions go as T 4 , T 7 , T 6 respectively. We have explicitly computed the number of such combinations up to T = 8 (for\nstacks containing a single brane). The results of this explicit computation are shown in\nFigure 3. Note that we have connected the data points with lines for clarity, but we have\nnot graphed the explicit analytic predictions, which like the case of B branes (2.24) converge slowly due to the log factors. As predicted, the number of AB branes is the largest,\nand the number of AA branes grows faster than the number of BB branes, but the AA\nand BB curves cross since the AA coefficient is much smaller than the BB coefficient.\nAt T = 8 we find that the exact numbers of brane combinations are\nNaa (8) = 30, 255\n\n(2.63)\n\nNbb (8) = 20, 244\n\n(2.65)\n\nNaa (4) = 264\n\n(2.66)\n\nNbb (4) = 558\n\n(2.68)\n\nNab (8) = 434, 775\n\n(2.64)\n\nThe numbers at T = 4 are\n\nNab (4) = 3, 029\n\n\u2013 22 \u2013\n\n(2.67)\n\n\f14\n\n12\n\n10\n\nln N(T)\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\nAA combinations\nAB combinations\nBB combinations\n\n-2\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\nT\n\nFigure 3: (Log of) number of type AA, AB, BB branes for varying T\n\nThese configurations are equivalent to brane stacks with all N = 2 at T = 8, and are\nsuppressed relative to the N = 1, T = 8 results above by approximately the expected\nfactors of 26 , 27 , 24 , though in each case growth is slightly faster due to logs.\n2.5.3 Three stacks\nFrom the complications in the preceding argument for the number of two-stack AA configurations, one might worry that the problem will become increasingly more complicated,\nand tadpoles will become increasingly more negative as more type A branes are included.\nFortunately, however, from the second part of the finiteness argument, we know that two\ntadpoles can have maximum total positive contribution of 6T . Thus, branes with the other\ntwo tadpoles negative are constrained by the same type of argument as in the above AA\nanalysis, with the only difference being that the a, b, . . . are constrained by a factor of 6T\ninstead of T . Thus, no matter how many branes we have, the largest tadpoles can have\nabsolute value no larger than T 5 and the second largest no larger than T 3 as in (2.57).\nFurthermore, when pairs of A-type branes are considered their total tadpoles must scale\nas (2.62), or just as a single A-type brane. This simplifies the analysis of configurations\nwith more branes.\nIn this subsection we briefly describe three-stack configurations of various types. We\ncontent ourselves with some simple scaling arguments and polynomial bounds on the rate\n\n\u2013 23 \u2013\n\n\fof growth of various combinations.\nLet us begin with BBB combinations. It is straightforward to see that by choosing\n3 different pairs of tadpoles for the three B-type branes we have order T 6 configurations.\nFor N, M, L B-type stacks, the number of possible configurations goes as\n\u0012\n\u0013\nT6\nNN b+M b+Lb (T ) \u223c O\n.\n(2.69)\nN 2 M 2 L2\nNow consider BBA. If we take an A-type brane with tadpoles of order (P, Q, R, S) \u223c\n(\u2212T 3 , T, T, T ), then we can consider B-type branes with P, Q and P, R tadpoles. There\nare T 4 of each type of B brane possible. These branes fix the ratios of moduli k/l, j/l and\nare compatible with any A type brane with negative P tadpole by just taking all of j, k, l\nsmall enough. Thus, there are T 11 possible combinations of this type. For N, M -stacks of\nB branes and an L stack of A-branes, we have\n\u0012\n\u0013\nT 11\nNN b+M b+La (T ) \u223c O\n(2.70)\nN 2 M 2 L7\nwhere as in the BA case, the numbers of each kind of B brane are suppressed by an extra\nfactor of L2 .\nNow consider BAA. Since any AA combination has tadpoles which scale at worst as\n(2.62), or just as a single A-type brane, we again can have at most order O(T 4 ) choices for\nthe type B brane. Let us assume that the b brane has nonzero tadpoles P, Q. Such a brane\nputs a constraint on the ratio of moduli k/l, but this constraint can be made compatible\nwith any two mutually compatible a branes with negative tadpoles in P, Q by just making\nk, l small enough. Thus, the number of BAA branes should go as T 10 . For a N -stack of\nB branes and M, L A stacks, we have\n\u0013\n\u0012\nT 10\nP2 (1/M, 1/L) .\n(2.71)\nNN b+M a+La (T ) \u223c O\nN 2 M 2 L2\nFinally, consider AAA. Since as shown in (2.62), any two of the A-type branes must\nhave a total tadpole of the same form as a single A-type brane, combining with a third\nA-type brane seems to lead to at most an additional factor of T 3 . Since not all sets of 3\nA-type branes are mutually compatible with any common set of moduli, this leads to an\nexpected upper bound on the number of AAA combinations\n\u0012\n\u0013\nT9\nNN a+M a+La (T ) \u223c O\nP\n(1/N,\n1/M,\n1/L)\n.\n(2.72)\n3\nN 2 M 2 L2\nBecause this family of configurations is subleading, and we will not use it in any specific\nmodel-building constructions, we do not carry the analysis of 3 A-stack configurations\nfurther here. It should be possible, however, to analyze this set of configurations in more\ndetail using the constraints from the proof of finiteness and methods like those used in the\ntwo A-stack analysis of the previous subsection. We leave a further analysis of this type\nfor future work.\n\n\u2013 24 \u2013\n\n\f2.5.4 Hidden sector A-type branes\nWe have found that including A-type branes can enhance the number of ways of including\nbrane stacks, particularly of B-type branes. One might worry that with more and more\nA-type branes in the hidden sector, more and more brane combinations could be realized\nin the visible sector for a given gauge group. This does not happen, however, essentially\nbecause of (2.62). To see this concretely, let us return to the number of ways we can include\na U (N ) factor in our gauge group from N type B branes. In the absence of A-type branes,\nthe number of possible stacks (2.24) went as T 2 /N 2 (dropping logs). As we found in (2.43),\nthe inclusion of an A-type brane in the hidden sector increases this to order T 4 /N 2 . From\n(2.62), however, we see that even when two A branes are included in the hidden sector the\nnumber of possible B-type branes still goes as T 4 /N 2 . In fact, when a second A-type brane\nis added in the hidden sector, no new type B branes at all become possible, since the limits\non the tadpoles of the type B brane are the same as with a single A brane in the hidden\nsector, and, as we showed in the discussion above, all B branes with a nonzero tadpole\nwhere the single A brane has a negative tadpole and which undersaturate the total tadpole\ncondition can be realized for some values of the moduli. Thus, we see that no matter how\nmany A-type branes are included in the hidden sector, including a stack of B-type branes\nwill always give rise to a factor of order T 4 in the total number of possible models.\nHow about type A branes where a type A brane is included in the hidden sector?\nFrom the analysis of AA combinations in 2.5.2 we note that in the order T 6 cases where\na\u2032 b \u2212 ab\u2032 = 1 and b = b\u2032 = 1, a \u223c O(T 2 ), the first brane can be chosen in (T 5 ) different\nways. The second brane is then constrained to have a\u2032 = a + 1, and \u03bd \u2032 has a range of\nsize T from the quadrilateral (2.51). So for each of the order T 5 choices for the first brane\nthere are order T choices for the second brane. This shows that with a hidden A-type\nbrane, there can be T 5 A-type branes in the visible sector. As for the B branes, however,\nthe presence of another A-type brane in the hidden sector cannot increase the number of\npossible branes in the visible sector, since the additional hidden brane cannot change the\nscaling of the tadpoles. By a similar argument to that above for type B branes, we expect\nthat even with an arbitrary number of A-type branes in the hidden sector, the scaling of\nthe number of models will get a factor of at most T 5 from the first A-stack, and at most\nT 3 from subsequent stacks, though we do not have a complete proof of this assertion.\n2.6 Summary of results\nIn summary, we have found that we can give an approximate asymptotic upper bound for\nthe number of models with any desired gauge group appearing as a subgroup by including\na polynomial factor of\nT4\n(2.73)\nN\u0302Nb b = 2\nNb\nfor each stack of Nb B-type branes. This factor does not include some additional log factors\nwhich may be particularly relevant at small T and assumes that there is at least one A\nbrane in the hidden sector; if there are no A branes in the hidden sector the factor is\n\n\u2013 25 \u2013\n\n\freduced to T 2 /Nb2 . Assuming a hidden sector A brane, a factor of\nN\u0302Na a =\n\nT5\nNa2\n\n(2.74)\n\nmust be included for the first stack of Na A-type branes; this factor reduces to T 3 /Na3 in\nthe absence of hidden sector A branes. We are fairly sure, though we have not definitively\nproven, that the contribution to the upper bound from the second and further stacks of\nA-type branes can be reduced to\nT3\n(2.75)\nN\u0302Na a = 2\nNa\nwhether or not there are hidden sector A-type branes. For gauge groups with many factors,\nthe product of these expressions will give an upper bound, but the actual number will be\nfewer as the moduli will be overconstrained. As an example, the number of ways in which\nthe Pati-Salam gauge group U (4) \u00d7 U (2) \u00d7 U (2) arises from AAB combinations (assuming\na hidden sector A brane) is bounded from the above estimates as T 12 /28 \u223c 3 \u00d7 108 . In\npractice, we expect that this is an overestimate and that the largest number of combinations\nmay come from ABB combinations. We will discuss explicit model building further in\nSection 4.\nWe emphasize again that the configurations we are counting are those in which a desired\ngauge group is realized as part of a complete model which saturates the tadpoles. For any\ngiven gauge group which we impose as a subgroup of the full UV gauge group arising from\nthe intersecting branes, each of the polynomial number of configurations we are counting\nwill have a large number of possible completions to a complete model. Generally the\nnumber of \"hidden sector\" completions will go roughly as eT \u2212Tm where Tm characterizes\nthe tadpole contribution from a given model which undersaturates the complete tadpole\ncancellation condition. By analyzing the different ways in which the desired group can\nbe realized as a piece of an intersecting brane model, we reduce the problem of analyzing\nthe space of models to a polynomial problem. We can analyze this polynomial number of\nsolutions for configurations of physical interest, and then in principle we could go on to do\na systematic analysis of the hidden sector possibilities in models of particular interest.\n2.7 Algorithms\nIn this section we have focused first on proving that the number of models which contain a\ndesired gauge group is finite, and then on using the insight from the proof of finiteness to\nestimate the number of models with a given gauge group. We can also, however, use the\nsame methods used to give estimates for the number of models with particular brane types\nand stack sizes to construct algorithms which explicitly enumerate these models. In general, these algorithms can be extremely efficient, and have time and memory requirements\nroughly in proportion to the number of solutions being constructed.\nTo be more explicit, consider the problem of explicitly enumerating one of the classes of\nbranes we have described above. Assume first that we have already constructed some brane\nconfiguration with total tadpoles P, Q, R, S \u2264 T , and we wish to construct all possible ways\nof including a stack of N type B branes while still undersaturating all tadpoles. As in the\n\n\u2013 26 \u2013\n\n\fdiscussion proceeding (2.22), we are searching for sets of four integers satisfying constraints\nlike pr \u2264 T \u2212 R, qs \u2264 T \u2212 S. By simply looping over p \u2264 T \u2212 R and then looping over\nr \u2264 \u230a(T \u2212 R)/p\u230b, we can search for all allowed pairs p, r in time (T \u2212 R) ln(T \u2212 R),\nwhich is roughly the number of solutions expected, and similarly for q, s. This gives us\na candidate set of allowed type B branes to include, and we can then explicitly check\nthe SUSY conditions for each possibility. This procedure can be iterated to include an\narbitrary number of B-type stacks, and C type stacks can be included by simply checking\nwhich tadpoles are not saturated.\nThis leaves us with the problem of constructing algorithms for finding combinations of\nstacks of type A branes. Using the bounds on individual tadpoles from these branes which\nwe found in the proof of finiteness, we can readily construct such algorithms. For single A\nbranes with for example a negative P tadpole, we just loop over all possible values of the\nn's and m's which have Q, R, S \u2264 T . As in (2.25), this can be done in time of order T 3\nand generates O(T 3 ) possible A-type branes.\nA pair of A-type branes with the same negative tadpole can be constructed by just\nrepeating the single A brane procedure, constraining the sum of the positive tadpoles.\nFor a pair of A-brane stacks with different negative tadpoles, we proceed as in the AA\nanalysis in subsection 2.5.2. We first loop over possible values of n2 , n3 , m2 , m3 and similar\nfor the primed variables. This gives a, b, a\u2032 , b\u2032 , which define the quadrilateral (2.51), which\nwe can then scan over for all possible values of \u03bd, \u03bd \u2032 . This generates a set of candidate\nAA possibilities which we can then check for the existence of moduli satisfying the SUSY\nconstraints.\nConstructing a set of three A-type branes proceeds again in a similar fashion. The\nworst case here is when all three type A branes have different negative tadpoles. Because\nof the bounds (2.14, 2.18), however, we know that the sum of positive tadpoles is bounded\nby 6T for one of the tadpoles which has a negative contribution from one A-brane. (In\nfact, a more careful analysis shows that in this 3-brane case the sum is bounded by 2T ,\nwhich helps with constant factors but not with scaling.) From this, we can sum for the\nfirst two A-branes as in the above AA discussion, just keeping (without loss of generality)\nS1 + S2 \u2264 T, R1 + R2 \u2264 2T . We construct all possible pairs under these conditions which\nundersaturate the tadpoles P, Q as above. We can then enumerate all possible third Abranes given the resulting upper bounds on all tadpoles besides R.\nFor more than three A-type branes, we can generalize this analysis. Basically the\nidea is that the tadpole constraints combined with inequalities like (2.48) coming from\nthe SUSY constraints lead to a set of inequalities like those determining the quadrilateral\n(2.51), so that we can loop over the various winding numbers and construct a set of allowed\ncombinations of k distinct A-brane stacks in time of order T 3k . For k > 3, however, the\nSUSY conditions generically will overdetermine the moduli, so this approach becomes less\nand less efficient as the fraction of SUSY-allowed combinations decreases. To construct\nall configurations with larger numbers of type A branes, it is probably most efficient to\nfirst construct all combinations which are large enough to uniquely determine the moduli\n(which will generically be 3 A brane stacks but may be more in special cases). Then, one\ncan construct all A-type branes which are compatible with a particular set of moduli. The\n\n\u2013 27 \u2013\n\n\fnumber Cm of such branes must be finite for any set of moduli m because of the inequality\n(2.5) which imposes a positive-definiteness condition on the tadpoles for fixed values of the\nmoduli. If the number of stacks required to fix the moduli was d, we can then check all\nk\u2212d possible ways of combining these branes into a configuration which undersaturates\nCm\nall tadpoles. This gives a complete algorithm for constructing all allowed configurations of\nk type A brane stacks.\n\n3. Distribution of intersection numbers\nNow that we have a systematic approach to estimating the number of brane configurations\nrealizing a desired gauge group, and efficient algorithms for generating such configurations,\nwe want to analyze some further physical features of these different models. The simplest\nnext feature to analyze is the intersection number between branes, which determines the\nnumber of chiral fermions associated with strings connecting these branes [6]. These chiral\nfermions transform in the fundamental representation of the gauge group associated with\none brane and in the antifundamental representation of the gauge group associated with\nthe other brane. We will not discuss the non-chiral spectrum other than to recall that all\nof the branes we are using (on the torus orientifold) have adjoint matter, and that other\nvector-like matter (such as the Higgs doublets) is obtained by taking pairs of branes which\ncoincide along one axis (i.e. with the same (ni , mi ) for some i).\nIn this section we will look at the distributions of intersection numbers for combinations of different types of branes. There are several motivations for considering these\ndistributions. Most generally, we are interested in looking for correlations of any kind in\nthe landscape of string vacua. As discussed in the introduction, such correlations are ultimately necessary to make predictions, assuming that all string vacua are viable. A strong\ncorrelation, such as an observation that all string models of this type with 3 generations\nof quarks also have 3 generations of leptons, would be very suggestive and would motivate\nlooking for similar correlations in other regions of the landscape. On the other hand, a\nsmooth broad distribution of intersection numbers with no correlations suggests that it\nmay be difficult to use string theory to predict the number of generations found in nature.\nAs a more specific application, we can use the distributions of intersection numbers to\nestimate what fraction of the total set of models with a fixed gauge group have a given\nnumber of generations (like 3). We carry out such an estimate in the next section using\nthe results developed in this section.\nTo understand the correlations between different intersection numbers, it is useful to\nintroduce the information theory notion of mutual entropy. Given a probability distribution\non possible values of a variable x, where pi is the probability that x = i, the (base 2) entropy\nof x is defined to be\nX\nH(x) = \u2212\npi log2 pi .\n(3.1)\ni\n\nThis quantity expresses the number of bits of information which are needed on average\nto encode a given instance of the random variable x. (For example, if x = 1, 2 each have\nprobability 1/4, and x = 3 has probability 1/2, then H(x) = 3/2; if x = 3 we can encode\n\n\u2013 28 \u2013\n\n\fthis in the bit 0, and we can encode x = 1, 2 in the two-bit sequences 10, 11.) Given a\ndistribution on two variables x, y, the mutual entropy is defined to be\nI(x, y) = H(x) + H(y) \u2212 H(x, y) .\n\n(3.2)\n\nThe mutual entropy, also called the relative entropy, encodes the number of bits of information given about y if x is known (or vice versa). If two variables are completely\nindependently distributed, then I = 0 (knowing x gives no information about y). If two\nvariables are completely correlated, so that there is a one-to-one function relating values\nof x with associated values of y then I(x, y) = H(x) = H(y).\nNow, let us define the winding numbers whose distributions we are interested in. If we\nhave two brane stacks, where the first has winding numbers (ni , mi ) and the second has\nwinding numbers (n\u0302i , m\u0302i ), then the intersection number between the branes is\nI=\n\nY\n(ni m\u0302i \u2212 n\u0302i mi ) .\n\n(3.3)\n\ni\n\nBecause of the orientifold, there is a distinction between A and B type branes a, b, which\nhave images a\u2032 6= a and b\u2032 6= b under the action of \u03a9, and a C type brane c, which is taken\nto itself under the action of \u03a9. Given two A-type branes a, \u00e2, for example, the intersection\nnumbers Ia\u00e2 and Ia\u00e2\u2032 are distinct, and must be computed separately.\n3.1 Single intersection numbers\nA coarse characterization of the distribution of individual intersection numbers can be\ngiven by considering the standard deviation of the set of intersection numbers within a\ngiven ensemble of pairs of branes. In the absence of negative tadpoles, we might expect\nthat typical winding numbers would be of order T 1/3 , giving typical intersection numbers of\norder T 2 . Even for type B branes, however, this is not quite right. Generally the winding\nnumbers are not evenly distributed. For example, from the analysis leading to (2.24), we\nsee immediately that at least order T 2 of the T 2 (ln T )2 type B branes undersaturating\nall tadpoles have three winding numbers (e.g. mi ) of order 1, and two winding numbers\n(e.g. n2 , n3 ) of order T . Thus, there are at least order T 4 BB combinations of the form\nn \u223c (0, T, T ), m \u223c (1, 1, 1), n\u0302 \u223c (1, 1, 1), m\u0302 \u223c (0, T, T ) which have Ibb\u0302 \u223c T 4 . It is also easy\nto show that a BB intersection number cannot be larger than 8T 4 , so we expect the rate of\ngrowth of the standard deviation in this ensemble to be order T 4 up to logs. Because of the\nnegative tadpoles on type A branes, which allow branes to have larger winding numbers,\nwe expect a broader distribution of intersection numbers for fixed T when other brane\ntypes are considered. For example, in an AB configuration with a hidden sector A brane,\nwe can have A brane winding numbers which go as n \u223c (T 3 , T, \u2212T ), m \u223c (1, 1, \u22121) and B\nbrane winding numbers which go as n\u0302 \u223c (1, T 3 , 1), m\u0302 \u223c (0, 1, \u2212T ). This would lead to a\nreasonably generic class of configurations with intersection numbers going as T 7 . We have\nnot found any configurations which would have faster growth, so we expect the standard\ndeviation of intersection numbers of pairs of branes to grow polynomially in T , with a rate\nof growth somewhere between T 4 and T 7 .\n\n\u2013 29 \u2013\n\n\fWe have computed the intersection numbers for all brane combinations of each type\n(assuming no hidden sector A branes) at various values of T . The standard deviations\nof the resulting distributions are plotted in Figure 4. We see that indeed the overall\nstandard deviation grows faster than T 4 ; the growth is dominated by AB configurations, which in the absence of hidden sector A branes have intersection numbers which\ngrow as T 5 from configurations with, for example, n \u223c (T, T, \u2212T ), m \u223c (1, 1, \u22121) and\nn\u0302 \u223c (1, 1, T 3 ), m\u0302 \u223c (0, T, \u22121).

For a reasonably smooth distribution, generic values will appear with frequency roughly 2\u2212H . We have computed the\nentropies of the distributions of intersection numbers for different types of branes, which\nare plotted in Figure 5. The entropies grow roughly as the log base 2 of the standard\ndeviations, indicating a reasonably uniform distribution.\nWhile we have computed the intersection numbers for generic T assuming that we\nare combining single branes, we can also interpret these results in terms of intersection\nnumbers when the size N of the brane stacks is increased. For example, in Figures 4, 5\nthe intersection numbers for a given value of T are equal to those for the desired physical\n\n\u2013 30 \u2013\n\n\fBB combinations\nBA combinations\nAA combinations\nBC combinations\nAC combinations\nall combinations\n\nEntropy of intersection number\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\nT\n\nFigure 5: Entropies in intersection numbers for different brane combinations\n\ntadpole value T0 = 8 and brane stacks of size N = 8/T . For example, for single A, B\nbranes with T = 4 the intersection number has a standard deviation of \u223c 50. This is the\nsame as for a pair of brane stacks each with N = 2 with T = 8. The consequence of this is\nthat for larger gauge groups, the intersection number is polynomially suppressed. While for\na U (1) \u00d7 U (1) theory, typical intersection numbers are in the hundreds (assuming hidden\nA branes are not included; including such branes would leave to even larger intersection\nnumbers), when even a gauge group like U (2) \u00d7 U (2) is included the intersection numbers\nare reduced by a numerical factor of order 25 = 32 (the factor in the data graphed in\nFigure 4 is slightly smaller than this, presumably due to log suppression of the rate of\ngrowth). When the gauge group has several factors of different rank, it is difficult to give a\nprecise estimate for the suppression of intersection numbers, but for generic configurations\nincluding the possibility of hidden sector A branes, we expect an overall suppression by a\nmonomial of degree around 7 in the sizes of the gauge group components. Thus, typical\nintersection numbers of a generic model with for example U (4) \u00d7 U (2) \u00d7 U (2) will be\ndown by a factor of at least 27 from intersection numbers in generic U (1) \u00d7 U (1) \u00d7 U (1)\nconfigurations.\nThe information contained in the standard deviation and entropy of the intersection\nnumber distributions give a rough characterization of the overall structure of these distributions.

The distribution is fairly sharply peaked, and has some fine structure. A\ncloser look at the detailed distribution of intersection numbers reveals some further features. In Figure 7 we plot the frequency with which individual intersection numbers take\ninteger values from 0 to 30 at T = 5 and T = 6. The pattern shown by this plot is\nthat composite intersection numbers with many factors are favored, and 0 is very strongly\nfavored, while prime intersection numbers and other intersection numbers with few factors\nare disfavored. This feature, as well as the sharply peaked nature of the distribution, comes\nfrom the structure of the intersection number formula (3.3), which is a product of 3 terms\neach of the form nm\u0302 \u2212 mn\u0302. While this structure is specific to the toroidal model we are\nconsidering here and presumably is not relevant for more general Calabi-Yau manifolds\nwith more general intersection formulae, we can briefly give a quantitative explanation for\nthe relative prevalence of different small intersection numbers. Consider for example the\nparity of the intersection number, associated with whether it is divisible by 2 or not. If the\nindividual winding numbers were chosen with arbitrary parities, of the 16 possible values\nfor the individual parities, nm\u0302 \u2212 mn\u0302 has parity 0 for 10 combinations and parity 1 for\n6 combinations. This would suggest that only (6/16)3 \u2248 5% of the intersection numbers\nshould be odd. Because the winding numbers ni , mi are relatively prime and not evenly\ndistributed (for example, 1 is particularly frequent), the true fraction is significantly larger.\n\n\u2013 32 \u2013\n\n\fT=5\nT=6\n\nAppearances of intersection number I\n\n2000\n\n1500\n\n1000\n\n500\n\n0\n-30\n\n-20\n\n-10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\nI\n\nFigure 7: Frequencies of small intersection numbers\n\nIn fact, we have 30% odd intersection numbers at T = 4 and 33% odd intersection numbers at T = 6. Similarly, we generically expect intersection numbers to be congruent to\n0 mod p for each p with a an enhancement factor which decreases with growing p. This\nnumber theoretic suppression of intersection numbers with few factors has a noticeable but\nrelatively mild effect on the prevalence of different intersection numbers, although it does\nlead to a significant enhancement of the probability for a vanishing intersection number.\nAmong small intersection numbers it does suppress 1 more than other numbers, but considering for example the frequency of appearance of the intersection number 3 across all\nbrane pairs, we find at T = 6 that the intersection number 3 appears about 0.66% of the\ntime, which is not particularly frequent or infrequent compared to other numbers in the\nrange from \u2212100 to 100, and which is quite compatible with the entropy H \u2248 8.57 for\nintersection numbers of pairs of branes at T = 6, which suggests that typical intersection\nnumbers will appear with frequency of order 0.5%. For comparison, the most common\nnonzero intersection number 12, with many factors, occurs about 1.8% of the time, while a\nmore highly suppressed larger prime intersection number like 23 occurs about 0.27% of the\ntime. Again, the greatest enhancement is for vanishing intersection number, which occurs\n7.5% of the time.\nIt is also worth noting that in model building, when we consider two branes x and y\nwhich are not invariant under \u03a9, the number of chiral fermions will go as the sum Ixy +Ixy\u2032 .\n\n\u2013 33 \u2013\n\n\fThis addition of intersection numbers tends in general to ameliorate somewhat the number\ntheoretic suppression or enhancement of certain values. The story is different, however, for\np = 2. In this case, we have\nIxy \u2261 Ixy\u2032 (mod 2) \u21d2 Ixy + Ixy\u2032 \u2261 0(mod 2) .\n\n(3.4)\n\nAs has been discussed in many places [9], this implies that we cannot build a 3-generation\nmodel in this orientifold with type A and B-branes alone without including some additional\nstructure like discrete B fields which can change these parity constraints.\n3.2 Multiple intersection numbers\nLet us now turn to pairs of intersection numbers. We are interested in determining whether\nthere is a strong correlation between distinct intersection numbers in a given brane configuration, or whether the intersection numbers are roughly independently distributed according to the single intersection number distribution described in the previous subsection.\nWe consider two possible types of correlation, first between intersection numbers Ixy and\nIxz in a configuration of 3 branes x, y, z, and second between intersection numbers Ixy and\nIxy\u2032 where y and y \u2032 are related through the orientifold action \u03a9.\nAs an example of the first type of correlation, consider the most prevalent 3 brane\ncombination ABB (in the absence of hidden A branes). Let us consider the ensemble of\nall such brane combinations a + b + b\u0302. The distribution of allowed values of (Iab , Iab\u0302 ) is\nshown in Figure 8 for T = 3. There are 1594 distinct ABB combinations for this value\nof T , and we consider all pairs of intersection numbers where for each brane we take either\norientifold image. Including either ordering of the branes b, b\u0302 gives 16 \u00d7 1594 = 25504\npairs of intersection numbers. We find that the resulting distribution is very close to a\nproduct distribution. Like the individual intersection numbers considered above, combinations where either intersection number is prime are suppressed, and composite intersection\nnumbers with many factors are enhanced. To quantify the correlations between the two\nintersection numbers, we have computed the mutual entropy between the distributions of\nthe two intersection numbers. The distribution of the individual intersection numbers has\nentropy H(I(x, y)) = H(I(x, z)) \u2248 4.553, while the mutual entropy is just\nI(I(x, y), I(x, z)) \u2248 0.085\n\n(3.5)\n\nThus, the distributions are almost completely independent. We have not done a thoroughly\ncomprehensive analysis of all brane configurations, but we have looked at a number of\nother cases and variations of this calculation, and the results appear to be fairly general.\nFor example, for the same ensemble, the mutual information between the AB and BB\nintersection numbers is I(I(x, y), I(y, z)) \u2248 0.102 while the entropy of the BB intersection\nnumbers is H(I(y, z)) \u2248 4.401. As we increase T , the ratio of mutual information to total\ninformation decreases further.\nWe have also looked at the correlation between intersection numbers I(x, y) and I(x, y \u2032 )\nwhere y, y \u2032 are related by \u03a9. In this case the correlations are somewhat stronger. From\n(3.4), the parities of the these intersection numbers must be the same. There are also further\n\n\u2013 34 \u2013\n\n\fABB intersections\n40\n\nI(x,z)\n\n20\n\n0\n\n-20\n\n-40\n\n-40\n\n-20\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\nI(x,y)\n\nFigure 8: Intersection numbers (Ixy , Ixz ) for ABB combinations at T = 3\n\ncorrelations arising from the fact that the winding numbers of y and y \u2032 are the same up to\nsigns. For the class of AB configurations, which dominate two-brane combinations in the\nabsence of hidden A branes, we find that at T = 4, the entropy of each intersection number\nis H(I(x, y)) \u2248 6.6, and the mutual entropy is I(I(x, y), I(x, y \u2032 )) \u2248 3.4, so knowing one\nintersection number gives almost half the information needed to determine the other. The\nratio of mutual information to total entropy decreases as T increases; at T = 6 we have\nH \u2248 8.7 and I \u2248 4.0.\nFinally, we have looked at some sets of 3 intersection numbers to see if correlations\nbetween three intersections are stronger than those between two intersection numbers. In\nparticular, we consider again the class of ABB configurations without hidden sector A\nbranes. In principle, we could compute the 3-way mutual entropy for the three intersection\nnumbers. This would require a substantial amount of data for a useful test, so we have\ndone a simpler spot test. We can select all configurations with a fixed intersection number,\nsay I(y, z) = I0 and ask whether the distribution of intersection numbers I(x, y), I(x, z)\nis significantly different from that without the constraint on I(y, z). We did this with all\n49,106 ABB combinations at T = 4 for the values I0 = 2 and I0 = 3, which correspond\nrespectively to 2504 and 4360 combinations. In each case we found that the distribution\nof intersection numbers I(x, y), I(x, z) was qualitatively similar to the distribution without\nconstraining I(y, z). For example, at I0 = 3, the mutual entropy was about 0.4, with\n\n\u2013 35 \u2013\n\n\findividual entropies for the AB intersection numbers of about 6.3. This suggests that even\nwhen 3-way correlations are considered there is very little connection between different\nintersection numbers.\nThe upshot of the analysis described in this section is that for all the brane combinations we considered here, the intersection numbers were fairly independent. For intersection\nnumbers I(x, y), I(x, z) between a fixed brane x and two other branes y, z which are not\nrelated by the orientifold symmetry and which live in an allowed combination, like the\nABB combinations, the intersection numbers are almost completely independent. We\nfound somewhat stronger correlations between intersection numbers I(x, y), I(x, y \u2032 ) where\ny and y \u2032 are related by the orientifold action. These correlations include the fact that such\npairs of intersection numbers must have the same parity, giving an even number of fermions\nliving in this sector of the theory.\nThe basic conclusion which follows from this analysis is that if we wish to estimate the\nnumber of models which have a given gauge group and given numbers of chiral fermions\nin each matter sector corresponding to pairs of intersecting branes, we can get a good\nestimate by multiplying the total number of models with the desired gauge group by the\nproduct of the fractions of those models with the desired number of fermions in each sector.\nThis provides a rough estimate of the number of models with the desired properties which\ncan be constructed using intersecting branes in this class of orientifolds. Furthermore,\nwe can use the algorithms described in the previous section to explicitly enumerate the\ndesired intersecting brane configurations. By imposing the intersection number conditions\nas we include branes, we can produce an algorithm which enumerates all desired brane\nconfigurations with given intersection numbers in a time which scales roughly as the number\nof solutions, with possibly a small polynomial overhead.\n\n4. Some specific models\nWe now have estimates for the number of models which can be constructed containing a\nparticular gauge group, and we have analyzed the general structure of the distributions of\nintersection numbers. We have an upper bound for the number of models possible with\na fixed gauge group such as SU (3) \u00d7 SU (2) \u00d7 U (1) or SU (4) \u00d7 SU (2) \u00d7 SU (2) which is\nof order O(T 13 /N12 N22 N39 ), with N3 the size of the smallest factor and T = 8. Thus, we\nexpect at most order 1010 or so configurations containing the gauge group SU (3)\u00d7SU (2)\u00d7\nU (1), and order 107 configurations containing the gauge group SU (4) \u00d7 SU (2) \u00d7 SU (2).\nThe precise numbers of these configurations can computed efficiently in a time of order\nof the number of configurations using the algorithms discussed in Section 2.7, and the\nresulting configurations can be tabulated. From the analysis of Section 3, we know that\nthe intersection numbers are roughly independently distributed, with each intersection\nnumber having values typically of order (T /N )7 , and with some mild suppression of prime\nintersection numbers and enhancement of intersection numbers with many factors. Fixing\n3 independent intersection numbers to take values of order 1\u221210, then, in a model with one\nof the above gauge groups, should reduce the number of models by a factor of something\nlike 109 for SU (3) \u00d7 SU (2) \u00d7 U (1) (using N = 3) or 106 for SU (4) \u00d7 SU (2) \u00d7 SU (2) (using\n\n\u2013 36 \u2013\n\n\fN = 4). In either case, this leads us to expect something like order 10 models with the\ndesired gauge group and intersection numbers.\nA natural next step in this analysis might be to perform a systematic search using the\nmethods we have described here for models with the standard model or Pati-Salam gauge\ngroup and 3 generations of chiral leptons and quarks in the appropriate representations of\nthe gauge group. To begin to construct semi-realistic models, however, we must take into\naccount the parity constraint (3.4), which states that Ixy + Ixy\u2032 \u2208 2Z if y is a type A or\ntype B brane. Since the number of chiral fermions in the U (Nx ) \u00d7 \u016a (Ny ) representation\nis given by this sum, we see that the parity constraint makes it impossible to have an odd\nnumber of generations when y is type A or B. Thus, we cannot immediately construct\nthe expected handful of standard model-like brane configurations as discussed above, since\ntheir generations will all be even.\nThere are two ways in which we can evade the parity constraint and generate odd\ngeneration numbers. The first is to include discrete B fields on some of the two-tori forming\nthe T 6 (in the T-dual picture this corresponds to skewing the tori). This approach was taken\nin [17, 19], where they systematically searched for constructions with the standard model or\nPati-Salam gauge group and 3 generations of quarks and leptons. Because the inclusion of\ndiscrete B fields only slightly changes the equations, basically shifting the winding modes\nin the affected tori by mi \u2192 mi + ni /2, we expect that the qualitative features of the\nanalysis we have carried out in this paper go through unchanged, so that in the presence of\ndiscrete B fields, while the parity constraint no longer rules out 3 generations, the expected\nnumber of models is still of order O(10). This is in nice correspondence with the results of\n[19], where 11 such distinct models were identified.\nThe second way of including odd generation numbers is to put part of the standard\nmodel or Pati-Salam group on C-type branes, which do not have extra image branes,\nand therefore are able to have odd fermion numbers. This approach was taken in [16,\n50, 51, 18] where they constructed a U (4) \u00d7 U (2) \u00d7 U (2) Pati-Salam model which in our\nlanguage is constructed with a U (4) coming from a stack of 4 B type branes, and two\nU (2) factors coming from C type branes. The B type brane oversaturates a tadpole, but\ncan be compensated by a hidden sector A-brane. In [48], they carried out an analysis of\nother hidden sector A-brane combinations which could also work with this construction.\nA similar construction of an U (4) \u00d7 U (2) \u00d7 U (1) \u00d7 U (1) model was given in [14].\nFrom the general analysis of this paper it is clear that another way to realize a 3generation Pati-Salam model is to take the U (4) to come from a stack of 4 A-type branes.\nLet us assume that we have two factors of U (2) coming from C-type branes c and \u0109 with\ntadpoles R = 1 and S = 1. From (3.3), the condition that an A-brane a has intersection\nnumbers Iac = Ia\u0109 = 3 implies that\n\u2212n1 m2 n3 = \u2212n1 n2 m3 = 3 .\n\n(4.1)\n\nThese conditions are satisfied if we take a stack of N = 4 A branes with\nn = (3, 1, \u22121),\n\nm = (1, 1, \u22121),\n\n\u2013 37 \u2013\n\n(P, Q, R, S) = (\u22123, 3, 1, 1) .\n\n(4.2)\n\n\falong with their orientifold images with m \u2192 \u2212m. Other solutions of (4.1) are possible\nbut require two different winding numbers to be 3, leading to more than one tadpole which\nis oversaturated. Taking the stack of 4 A-branes (4.2) and their images and the two pairs\nof C type branes, we have total contributions to the tadpole (\u221212, 12, 5, 5). We need to\ninclude at least one additional \"hidden sector\" A-type brane to cancel the excess tadpole\nin Q. We have systematically searched for such hidden branes, and found 17 possibilities\nfor this hidden sector brane, which are listed in Appendix B. There are presumably many\nother possible hidden sector combinations of multiple A branes, but we have not searched\nfor those.\nA further check which must be performed to confirm that the models we have constructed with a single hidden sector A-brane are allowed is to confirm that these brane\ncombinations either satisfy the K-theory constraints (2.6) or satisfy these constraints after\na further set of branes is included. Once we have a set of branes which satisfy the K-theory\nconstraints and undersaturate all tadpoles, the brane combination can be extended to one\nwhich precisely cancels all tadpoles by adding type C branes, which do not contribute to\nthe K-theory constraints (2.6). None of the 17 possible combinations listed in Appendix 2\nsatisfy the K-theory constraints without the addition of further branes. We have checked\nall 17 models for combinations which satisfy the K-theory constraints as well as the SUSY\nconditions with the addition of a single type B brane. Of the 17 models, only the 5th can\nbe combined with a single type B brane to satisfy all the K-theory constraints. In this\nmodel, we start with a stack of 4 A-type branes as in (4.2), C-branes with R = 1 and\nS = 1, and a single A-type brane with\nn = (2, 1, 3),\n\nm = (1, \u22121 \u2212 2),\n\n(P, Q, R, S) = (6, \u22124, 2, 3) .\n\n(4.3)\n\nSo far this gives total tadpoles (\u22126, 8, 7, 8). We can then add either a single B brane with\nn = (14, 1, 1),\n\nm = (\u22121, 0, 1),\n\n(P, Q, R, S) = (14, 0, 1, 0)\n\n(4.4)\n\nwhich fixes all the K-theory constraints and precisely saturates all tadpoles, or we can add\na single B brane with\nn = (12, 1, 1),\n\nm = (\u22121, 0, 1),\n\n(P, Q, R, S) = (12, 0, 1, 0)\n\n(4.5)\n\nwhich fixes all the K-theory constraints and requires an additional pair of (really 4) type\nC branes with P = 1 to cancel all tadpoles.\nThe class of models we have constructed here are not completely realistic, in that\nthey contain chiral exotics which are difficult to remove from the low-energy spectrum\n(see, e.g. [51, 45]). Nonetheless, they provide an illustration of how the methods we have\ndeveloped can be used to construct quasi-realistic models with certain desired features.\nThe construction described here will presumably lead to some other 3-generation PatiSalam models if more than one hidden sector A-brane or more than one hidden sector B\nbrane is allowed, but we have not investigated this possibility further. We content ourselves\nfor now with this pair of new possibilities as examples of how the techniques developed\nin this paper allow us to systematically search for intersecting brane models with given\n\n\u2013 38 \u2013\n\n\fgauge group and numbers of chiral fermions. Like other such constructions, the models\nwe have constructed have various \"hidden sector\" gauge groups and chiral matter fields\ntransforming under the hidden gauge groups. In the UV, anomalies are cancelled by the\nGreen-Schwarz mechanism, but in the low-energy field theory, generally these models will\nbe anomalous, and much of the hidden sector will be lifted to a high energy scale, leaving\na residual anomaly-free low-energy field theory. We leave a detailed analysis of the models\nwe have described here for future work, our interest here is primarily as examples of the\nmethodology developed herein and not on detailed phenomenology.\n\n5. More general Calabi-Yau orientifolds\nThe type of analysis we just discussed can be directly generalized to orientifolds of other\nCalabi-Yau manifolds, given a sufficiently large set of supersymmetric branes. While at this\npoint it is not clear how large a set would suffice to get a representative sample, probably\nthe minimal requirement is to have a family with at least b2 parameters (in IIB terms),\nso that the ratio between the tadpole contributions can be adjusted independently (their\noverall scale can be adjusted by replicating the branes). It would be nice to have a family\nof branes with all 2b2 + 2 homology classes freely adjustable. Note that for T 6 /Z22 (leaving\nout fractional branes) we had 6 winding numbers while 2 + 2b2 = 8, so we did not quite\nmeet this criterion even there.\nIn the IIA picture, the supersymmetric branes are D6-branes wrapping special Lagrangian submanifolds. The only general construction we know for these is to embed the\nbrane in the fixed point of an antiholomorphic involution, which is not sufficiently general.\nIn the IIB picture, the supersymmetric branes wrap holomorphic submanifolds of the\nCY, and carry holomorphic bundles. Now there is a simple class of bundles we can construct\non any smooth CY, namely the holomorphic line bundles. These were first suggested for\nmodel building in [5] and have been much used since. On a simply connected CY threefold,\na line bundle is parameterized by its first Chern class, an element of H 2 (M, Z). Thus the\nline bundles provide a family of branes with b2 parameters.\nAs we mentioned in subsection 2.1, on T 6 the line bundles are mirror to D6-branes\nwith all winding numbers ni = 1, so this is a natural subset of the brane configurations we\nconsidered earlier. One might ask why these simple bundles were not used in the original\nheterotic string constructions. The answer is that in the weak coupling and large volume\nlimit, the supersymmetry condition Eq. (2.1) does not admit interesting solutions. We\nsaw this implicitly in the IIB analysis above, in that solving the full conditions require\nfinite K\u00e4hler moduli. It is also true in the heterotic string, as the \u03bc-stability condition on\nbundles is exactly what one obtains by dropping the m1 m2 m3 term from Eq. (2.1), and\nthus a \u03bc-stable direct sum of line bundles would give a (non-existent) IIB brane solution\nin the large volume limit.\nRecently in [10], it was shown that heterotic string loop effects produce a correction\nto the \u03bc-stability condition which allows sums of line bundles to provide supersymmetric\nsolutions there as well. In the SO(32) string this is of the same form as Eq. (2.1) (indeed\nit is S-dual to it), while in the E8 \u00d7 E8 string it is similar. We mention this in passing as a\n\n\u2013 39 \u2013\n\n\fpiece of evidence that all of the various known constructions are just parts of a larger (and\none hopes simpler) classification.\nAnother natural family is the D5-branes wrapping holomorphic curves. The homology\nclass of a curve also has b2 parameters; of course there can be many curves in a given class\nso there are further discrete choices.2\nIn the following, we will discuss the problem of enumerating sums of line bundles and\ncurves satisfying the tadpole cancellation conditions on general Calabi-Yau orientifolds.\nLet us briefly mention two other interesting sets of branes. One is the rational boundary\nstates in Gepner models; these have been used in [31]. These correspond to certain bundles\nobtained by the generalized McKay correspondence for the corresponding orbifold of C5 ,\nin a way which is discussed in [28]; the generalization of this to orientifolds is partially\nunderstood [12].\nA second interesting class of branes, which makes sense for a Calabi-Yau manifold\nwhich is a subvariety of a toric variety, is the restriction of the equivariant bundles on the\ntoric variety. This includes the large set of toric hypersurfaces, complete intersections in\ntoric varieties, and so on, so it applies very generally. In words, we are using the fact that\nsuch a Calabi-Yau manifold admits a simple embedding into a higher dimensional space (the\ntoric variety) with a large symmetry group (a product of U (1)'s); the equivariant bundles\nare then the bundles on which this symmetry group acts by gauge transformations. This\nincludes the line bundles, and loosely speaking, the generalization corresponds in the case\nof T 6 to lifting the restriction on the winding numbers ni = 1, to allow general ni . Having\nsaid this, however, we leave further discussion of this class to future work.\n5.1 General framework\nWe will now set up a general framework for enumerating type IIB orientifold compactifications using any set of bundles on any Calabi-Yau compactification. Another description\nof this class of compactifications can be found in [11]. We will assume various standard\nmathematical definitions and be somewhat telegraphic; it may be helpful to look ahead at\nthe sections on the torus and on the Calabi-Yau examples.\n5.1.1 Basic definitions\n\u2022 M is the the Calabi-Yau threefold.\n\u2022 J \u223c\n= H 1,1 (M, R), and J \u2208 J is a K\u00e4hler form. In type II theory this would be\ncomplexified by the B field, but the orientifold projection removes this continuous\ndegree of freedom. However, there is still a discrete choice of B = 0 or B = 1/2 on\neach two-cycle consistent with this projection. This can summarized in an element\n2B \u2208 H 2 (M, Z2 ).\n\u2022 F \u2208 F \u2261 J \u2229 H 2 (M, Z) is a normalized magnetic field strength, F = dA for a U (1)\nconnection.\n2\n\nIn orientifold theories besides type I, it may also be possible to turn on magnetic flux F on the D5.\n\n\u2013 40 \u2013\n\n\f\u223c H4 (M, Z), so we can also think of this datum as\n\u2022 By Poincar\u00e9 duality, H 2 (M, Z) =\nthe homology class of a two complex dimensional submanifold D of M . A line bundle\nwith magnetic field F will be denoted either O(D) or O(F ). Such a submanifold is\ncalled a \"divisor\" in algebraic geometry; a generic section of the line bundle O(D)\nwill vanish on D. Physically, one can think of the D9-brane carrying such a line\nbundle, as a bound state of the \"elementary\" (zero flux) D9 with a D7 wrapped on\nD.\n\u2022 {\u03c9 i } is an integral basis for F, so that a field strength can be written as F =\nOne can also introduce an integral basis of divisors Di .\n\nP\n\ni fi \u03c9\n\ni.\n\n\u2022 The dual bundle V \u2228 to a bundle V is defined by inverting the transition functions.\nFor a line bundle O(F ), we have O(F )\u2228 = O(\u2212F ).\n\u2022 If 2B as defined above is not zero, the field strength F which appears in all of the\nfollowing definitions should be replaced by F \u2212 B \u2208 H ( M, R). This can be defined\nby choosing a lift of 2B to H 2 (M, Z) and taking (2F \u2212 2B)/2.\n\u2022 K \u2261 \u2295p H p,p (M, R) \u2229 H 2p (M, Z) is the lattice of even homology classes. More precisely, this should be K 0 (M ), but this matters only for the torsion, so we ignore it\nfor now.\n\u2022 \u03a9 is the orientifold operation on a bundle. In type I theory, this is the same as the\ndual, thus \u03a9O(F ) = \u03a9(\u2212F ). In other IIB models, \u03a9 acts as a reflection on K.\n\u2022 We denote the Chern character (K theory class) of a bundle E as [E] \u2208 K. It is\nadditive under direct sum. For a vector bundle E with curvature F ,\n[E] = tr eF .\nFor the special case of a line bundle O(F ) this is just eF .\n\u2022 The K theoretic intersection product on K is\nZ\nK \u2228 * L * \u00c2(M )\n\u03b7(K, L) =\nM\n\n1\nc2 (M ). It\nwhere \u00c2(M ) is the A-roof genus as in the index formula, \u00c2(M ) = 1 + 24\n2\nis antisymmetric and integral on F , and determines the number of bifundamental\nmultiplets between branes carrying the bundles K and L.\n\n5.1.2 Calabi-Yau geometric data\nSo far, we have just been giving names to various standard spaces and constructions; the\nonly dependence on M is through its second Betti number b2 = dim H 2 (M, R).\nThe non-trivial geometric data we need to know about M to construct brane theories\nis the following:\n\n\u2013 41 \u2013\n\n\f\u2022 C(\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3) : J 3 \u2192 R is the cubic intersection form, defined as\nZ\n\u03b1 \u2227 \u03b2 \u2227 \u03b3.\nC(\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3) =\nM\n\nIt takes integer values on F 3 . Unless otherwise denoted, products on J , F and so\non are in terms of this form.\nOne can equivalently think of this in Poincar\u00e9 dual terms as C(Di , Dj , Dk ), the\nnumber of points in which three divisors intersect. From this point of view, one can\nsee that C(Di , Dj , Dk ) \u2265 0 for three distinct holomorphic submanifolds.\n\u2022 The second Chern class c2 (M ) \u2208 H 4 (M, Z). This is Poincar\u00e9 dual to a class in\nH2 (M, Z), and an equivalent way to give this information is the set of intersection\nnumbers c2 (M ) * Di for a basis of divisors.\n\u2022 The K\u00e4hler cone KC(M ) \u2282 H 2 (M, R) is the set of K\u00e4hler forms of sensible K\u00e4hler\nR\nmetrics (all integrals \u03c9 k over holomorphic cycles are positive). It is convex, i.e.\ngiven any \u03c91 , \u03c92 \u2208 KC(M ), we have \u03c91 + \u03c92 \u2208 KC(M ).\n\u2022 The Mori cone M C(M ) \u2282 H2 (M, Z) given by the effective classes; i.e. the classes\nof holomorphic curves in M . By Poincar\u00e9 duality we can identify it with a subset of\nH 4 (M, Z). It is also a convex cone.\nIt turns out that the K\u00e4hler cone and the Mori cone are dual, in the sense that\n\u03c9 \u2208 H 2 (M, R) is in the K\u00e4hler cone if\n\u2200C \u2208 M C.\n\n\u03b7(\u03c9, C) > 0\nThus either can be deduced from the other.\n\nThis data is used as follows. We choose a set of branes B\u03b1 , and consider a configuration\nB=\n\nX\n\nN\u03b1 B \u03b1\n\n\u03b1\n\nwhere B\u03b1 are distinct branes and N\u03b1 are multiplicities. In type II theory this configuration\nQ\nwould have gauge group \u03b1 U (N\u03b1 ), before taking into account anomalous U (1)'s.\nIn a type I model, the brane configuration must satisfy\n\u03a9B = B \u2228 = B,\nand tadpole cancellation,\n[B] \u2261 T = 16 + c2 (M ),\n\n(5.1)\n\nwhere \"1\" is the generator of H 0 (M, Z).\nThis is an equation between elements of K, whose expansion into components is the set\nof tadpole constraints. To make this a bit more concrete, suppose that each of the branes\n\n\u2013 42 \u2013\n\n\fP\nB\u03b1 is a D9-brane carrying a line bundle with divisor Da = i mia Di , and comes with an\nimage B\u03b1\u2032 with divisor \u2212Da . Then the tadpole conditions become\nX\n8=\nN\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\nand\nTi \u2261 c2 (M ) * Di =\n\nX\n\nNa C(Da , Da , Di )\n\na\n\nwhere Di runs over a basis of divisors.\nFor a supersymmetric compactification in the large volume limit, each brane must\nsatisfy\nZ\u03b1 \u2261 C(F\u03b1 + iJ, F\u03b1 + iJ, F\u03b1 + iJ) = \u2212i\u03bb\u03b1\n\u03bb\u03b1 \u2208 R +\nwhere J \u2208 H 2 (M, R) is the K\u00e4hler class. The central charge Z could equivalently be\nwritten as\nZ = \u03b7(e\u2212iJ , [Bi ]).\nFor reasons we discuss momentarily, here we restrict attention to the large volume\nlimit, in which these conditions can be broken into\n0 = ReZ\u03b1 = \u22123C(J, J, F\u03b1 ) + C(F\u03b1 , F\u03b1 , F\u03b1 )\n\n(5.2)\n\n0 < \u2212ImZ\u03b1 = C(J, J, J) \u2212 3C(J, F\u03b1 , F\u03b1 ).\n\n(5.3)\n\nand\nUnlike the torus, where these equations are exact, on a general Calabi-Yau they will\nreceive world-sheet instanton corrections. By the \"large volume limit\" we mean the limit in\nwhich these can be dropped, which is when the volumes of all holomorphic curves are large\nin string units. If one goes away from the large volume limit, there are further subtleties in\nthe discussion because supersymmetric branes are in general not branes carrying bundles\nbut instead \u03a0-stable objects in the derived category (see [3, 15] for a discussion of this).\nSince many if not most of the models obtained by the construction discussed here will\nstabilize K\u00e4hler moduli at the string scale, these subtleties will generally be important.\nWhile a detailed discussion is not easy and depends on the example, a subset of models\nfor which the large volume equations might give a reasonable description is to only allow\nD9-branes for which the supersymmetry conditions admit simultaneous solutions at large\nvolume, as well as D5-branes, while forbidding D7-branes,. This is because D7-branes\ncannot be simultaneously supersymmetric with the others without large \u03b1\u2032 corrections,\nand furthermore they are known to decay into the others at string scales (again, see [3]\nfor examples and references). Admittedly this is a hypothesis which would require some\njustification in examples before accepting, but based on the current knowledge we think it\nis reasonable to explore. Of course one can also deal with this point by restricting attention\nto configurations which stabilize the K\u00e4hler moduli at large volume.\nThe generalization of Eq. (5.1) to include D5-branes wrapping holomorphic cycles is\nsimple; now [B] is simply the class of B in H2 (M, Z). Furthermore, at least in the large\n\n\u2013 43 \u2013\n\n\fvolume limit, the D5 branes in type I theory are guaranteed to respect the same supersymmetry as the O9-plane, independent of the K\u00e4hler moduli. However, unlike the torus,\nthis statement can get corrections from world-sheet instantons. An interesting concrete\nexample using these in which the subtleties we mentioned are addressed is [29], in which\nthese corrections are used to break supersymmetry.\n5.1.3 Matter content\nGiven a consistent configuration, we can study the matter content. Open strings stretched\nbetween branes give rise to matter in a variety of two-index tensor representations constructed from the fundamental Ei and antifundamental \u0112i . According to the index theorem, the total matter content is\nEij \u2261 Ei \u2297 \u0112j\n\n\u03b7(Bi , Bj )\n\nPij \u2261 Ei \u2297 Ej\n\n\u03b7(Bi , \u03a9Bj )\n1\nSi \u2261 Sym2 Ei\n(\u03b7(Bi , \u03a9Bi ) \u2212 \u03b7([\u03a9], Bi ))\n2\n1\nAi \u2261 \u22272 Ei\n(\u03b7(Bi , \u03a9Bi ) + \u03b7([\u03a9], Bi ))\n2\nwhere [\u03a9] = 1 + ... is the class of the orientifold plane.\nThis spectrum can be usefully summarized in the generalized intersection matrix\n\u02c6 i , Bj ) = \u03b7(Bi , Bj ) + \u03b7(Bi , \u03a9Bj ).\nI(B\nThe two terms are antisymmetric and symmetric matrices respectively, so this does not\nlose information.\n5.2 Examples\n5.2.1 Torus\nExplicit formulas for the Z22 invariant subsector of T 6 :\n\u2022 J \u223c\n= R3 with integral basis \u03c9i \u2261 dz i \u2227 dz\u0304 i /2iIm\u03c4i . The intersection form is the totally\nsymmetric form with\nC(\u03c91 , \u03c92 , \u03c93 ) = 1\nand all other entries zero. Equivalently, c123 \u2261 1 etc.\n\u2022 K\u223c\n= Z8 , and is the algebra over the integers generated by three commuting variables\nR\n\u03c91 , \u03c92 , \u03c93 each satisfying \u03c9i2 = 0. Defining \u03c9i\u2228 = \u2212\u03c9i and a as the coefficient of\n\u03c91 \u03c92 \u03c93 , we have\nZ\n\u03b7(K, L) =\n\nK \u2228 * L.\n\nIn components, we write a vector\n\nK = (r, f~, m,\n~ c)\nand the intersection form is then\n\u03b7(K, K \u2032 ) = rc\u2032 \u2212 cr \u2032 + f~ * m\n~ \u2032 \u2212 f~\u2032 * m.\n~\n\n\u2013 44 \u2013\n\n\f\u2022 The orientifold operation takes F \u2192 \u2212F and thus\nK = (r, f~, m,\n~ c) \u2192 \u03a9K = (r, \u2212f~, m,\n~ \u2212c).\n\u2022 A line bundle is characterized by F =\n\nP\n\ni\n\nmi \u03c9i with mi \u2208 Z. Its Chern character is\n\n1\n1\n[eF ] = (1, mi , cijk mj mk , cijk mi mj mk )\n2\n6\nwith integer entries.\nThis corresponds to the subset of the branes we were using earlier with all ni = 1. Let\nus see what the rest of the branes look like. First, the other C-type branes with two ni = 0\nare clearly D5-branes wrapping the T 2 with ni = 1.\nOn T 2 , there is a unique U (n) bundle Vn,m with constant field strength and c1 (Vn,m ) =\nm. It is the T-dual of a D1 brane with winding numbers (n, m). Thus the T-dual of a\nD6-brane in IIa theory is the tensor product bundle\nV~n,m\n~ = \u2297i Vni ,mi\nwith rank n1 n2 n3 . Its Chern character is the tensor product of the three sets of winding\nnumbers,\n\u0013\n\u0012\nmi\n3\n[V~n,m\n.\n~ ] = \u2297i=1\nni\nThis accounts for all the A-type branes, and the B-branes with all ni 6= 0. The Bbranes with one ni = 0 are D7-branes carrying bundles in IIb terms. As we discussed\nearlier, on more general string-scale Calabi-Yau manifolds the large volume discussion will\ntend to break down for these branes.\nOne can check that the supersymmetry conditions agree with those we were using\nearlier (possibly up to signs in the definitions). To check the tadpole conditions, one needs\nto compute c2 (M ) for M a smooth resolution of T 6 /Z2 \u00d7 Z2 . This was done for a related\nbut slightly different case (compactification with D7 and D3 branes) in [25]. There, it\nwas found that matching the orientifold tadpole implies the presence of O3 planes in the\nresolved space as well as O7 planes. The standard T 6 /Z2 \u00d7 Z2 orientifold of our previous\ndiscussion has O5 plane tadpole contributions in the IIB picture which presumably persist\nin a similar fashion even after the resolution. This generalization can be made for CalabiYau as well, but we save this for future work.\nThe intersection matrix between a pair of these branes is\n3\nY\n(ni m\u2032i \u2212 mi n\u2032i ).\nI(V, V ) =\n\u2032\n\ni=1\n\nFurthermore,\nI(V, \u03a9V \u2032 ) = \u2212\n\n3\nY\n(ni m\u2032i + mi n\u2032i ).\ni=1\n\n\u2013 45 \u2013\n\n\fThe generalized intersection matrix is\nZ\n\u02c6\nIij = [Bi\u2228 ] * ([Bj ] + [\u03a9Bj ])\nWe have\n\u02c6\nI(K,\nK \u2032 ) = \u22122(cr \u2032 + f~\u2032 * m)\n~\nThe overall coefficient 2 here is correct and thus if I\u02c6 has any odd entries, we are forced to\nturn on B field.\n5.2.2 Elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau manifolds\nLet us give another simple example3 with b2 = 3, the elliptic fibration over F0 = P 1 \u00d7 P 1 .\nLet D1 and D2 be the divisors which are the elliptic fibrations over the two P 1 's in the\nbase, and let the third divisor be D0 = B + 2D1 + 2D2 , where B is the section of the elliptic\nfibration. Then, the nonzero intersection numbers are\nD03 = 8, D02 D1 = D02 D2 = 2, D0 D1 D2 = 1.\nTaking the K\u00e4hler class to be\nJ=\n\nX\n\nji Di ,\n\ni=0,1,2\n\nthe volume of the Calabi-Yau is\nvol =\n\n1 3 4 3\nJ = j0 + j02 j1 + j02 j2 + j0 j1 j2 .\n6\n3\n\nFor a consistent metric, all holomorphic cycles must have positive volume; the subset of\nji \u2208 R3 in which this is true is called the K\u00e4hler cone. We chose our basis of divisors so\nthat the K\u00e4hler cone turns out to be simply the region with all (j0 , j1 , j2 ) positive, but in\ngeneral it is defined by a more complicated set of linear inequalities.\nThe intersections with c2 (M ) are given by:\nc2 B = \u22124, c2 D1 = c2 D2 = 24\nand thus the tadpole constraints become\n8=\n\nX\n\nNa\n\n(5.4)\n\nNa 2ma1 ma2\n\n(5.5)\n\na\n\n\u22124 =\n24 =\n\nX\na\n\nX\n\nNa 2(ma0 )2 + 2ma0 ma2\n\na\n\n24 =\n\nX\n\nNa 2(ma0 )2 + 2ma0 ma1\n\na\n\n3\n\nWe thank Bogdan Florea for providing this example.\n\n\u2013 46 \u2013\n\n\u0001\n\n\u0001\n\n(5.6)\n(5.7)\n\n\fand the supersymmetry conditions become\n3(8j02 + 4j0 j1 + 4j0 j2 + 2j1 j2 )m0 + 3(2j02 + 2j0 j2 )m1 + 3(2j02 + 2j0 j1 )m2 =\n\n(5.8)\n\n8m30 + 6m20 m1 + 6m20 m2 + 6m0 m1 m2\nand\n8j03 + 6j02 j1 + 6j02 j2 + 6j0 j1 j2 >(5.9)\n3(8m20 + 4m0 m1 + 4m0 m2 + 2m1 m2 )j 0 + 3(2m20 + 2m0 m2 )j 1 + 3(2m20 + 2m0 m1 )j 2 .\nWe note for comparison with the torus discussion that, while naively the total tadpoles\nare not all positive, if we add to Eq. (5.5) some linear combination of the other equations,\nthe total tadpoles will become positive. However one might ask what content this has and\nwhether there is any preferred choice of basis for these equations. We will answer this\nquestion shortly.\nMany other elliptic fibrations can be found in the physics literature, as they find\napplication in F theory, in heterotic string compactification, and so on.\n5.2.3 Toric hypersurface Calabi-Yau manifolds\nSuch a CY is defined as the zero locus of a single equation in a four-dimensional toric\nvariety, the \"ambient\" space T . Such a compact toric variety is determined by a fourdimensional polytope, and the Calabi-Yau condition then reduces to the condition that the\npolytope be reflexive.\nA complete database of such polytopes is available at [46]. There are simple combinatoric algorithms for working out c2 (M ), the cubic intersection form and the K\u00e4hler and\nMori cones from the polytope, see for example the appendix to [23].\nIt will be quite interesting to scan over this database and work out the general pattern\nof solutions. For example, does the number of solutions grow with b2 , as one might expect?\nOr do the tadpole conditions become sufficiently complicated that explicit solutions are\ndifficult to find?\n5.3 Positivity and brane classes\nAs in subsection 2.2, certain basic consequences of the supersymmetry and tadpole conditions can be analyzed a priori, leading to a division of the supersymmetric branes into\nthree types generalizing what we had for the torus.\nWe start by asking what it means for contributions to the tadpole cancellation conditions Eq. (5.1) to be positive or negative. A natural definition to make is that the \"positive\"\ntadpoles are those in the Mori cone, i.e. [B] = r + T with r \u2265 0 and T \u2208 M C(M ). This\nreduces to our previous definition for the torus. It is also known that\nch2 (M ) \u2208 M C(M )\nfrom Bogomolov's theorem applied to the tangent bundle T M . Thus, we can again try to\nargue that solutions to the equations Eq. (5.1) correspond to ways to decompose a positive\nvector into a sum of positive and \"nearly positive\" contributions.\n\n\u2013 47 \u2013\n\n\fFor our example of a fibration over F0 , this definition tells us to replace Eq. (5.5) with\nthe constraint dual to the divisor D0 = B + 2D1 + 2D2 . This is a sum over the equations\nEqs. 5.5, 5.6 and 5.7 with the corresponding coefficients, giving\nX\n\u0001\n92 =\nNa 2ma1 ma2 + 8(ma0 )2 + 4ma0 ma1 + 4ma0 ma2\n(5.10)\na\n\nWhile equivalent, the idea is that with this definition, \"most\" branes will make positive\ncontributions to the right hand side. For example, all D5's wrapping holomorphic cycles\nclearly will do so, by the definition of the Mori cone.\nNow, unlike the torus and our example, a general Calabi-Yau manifold will typically\nnot have any preferred homology basis in which the K\u00e4hler cone is simply defined by\nJi > 0 \u2200i. This is because the Mori cone will typically have more than b2 generators, and\none must enforce an inequality for each generator.\nOne can always take the basis for H2 (M, Z) to consist of a subset of the generators\nof the Mori cone, and we shall do this below. In this case, the K\u00e4hler cone will be the\nintersection of Ji > 0 \u2200i with additional inequalities.\nWe can now proceed to divide up the supersymmetric branes.\nC) One nonvanishing tadpole.\nClearly the pure D9-brane (with no flux) is a C-type brane. And, if we choose our\nbasis for H2 (M, Z) to be a subset of the generators of the Mori cone, all other vectors\nwith a single tadpole will correspond to D5's wrapping holomorphic curves. Thus,\nwe have a complete set of \"filler\" branes, and can again argue that any configuration\nof A and B-branes which undersaturates the tadpoles, can be completed in a unique\nway to a configuration satisfying Eq. (5.1). Furthermore, as we discussed above, the\nC-branes lead to no constraints on the K\u00e4hler moduli, at least in the large volume\nlimit.\nNote that, in the typical case in which the Mori cone will has more than b2 generators,\nthe precise identification of which branes are the C-branes will depend on our choice\nof basis for H2 (M, Z).\nB) Branes whose tadpole contribution lies in the Mori cone:\nThis includes all supersymmetric D5-branes, which as before do not constrain the\nK\u00e4hler moduli.\nIt also includes a subset of the line bundles (magnetized D9-branes). By definition,\nthe tadpole contribution for a line bundle with flux F will lie in the Mori cone if\nC(F, F, J) \u2264 0\n\n\u2200J \u2208 KC(M )\n\n(5.11)\n\n(the sign is correct, as can be checked for the torus; this generalizes the minus signs\nwe introduced in Eq. (2.3).\nThis is not an easy equation to satisfy, as the coefficients cijk in our preferred basis\nwill tend to be positive. The B-branes on the torus are obtained by taking (say)\n\n\u2013 48 \u2013\n\n\fF1 > 0, F2 < 0 and F3 = 0, and relying on the vanishing of all cijk with coincident\nindices. In other words, these are branes whose gauge fields are non-trivial in only\nfour of the six dimensions.\nTo illustrate the opposite case, consider a divisor D1 for which the only non-zero\nintersections are c111 > 0 (for example a local P2 . Then Eq. (5.11) forces the corresponding F to be zero.\nA) Branes whose tadpole contribution lies outside of the Mori cone:\nThis will include most line bundles. One might go on to ask if there is any sense in\nwhich their contributions to the tadpole equations Eq. (5.1) have a \"single negative\ncomponent\" as was the case for T 6 . This seems unlikely on the face of it, but\nfortunately need not be the case for a finiteness argument to work.\nWe should say the parallel between these definitions and those we made for the torus is\nnot complete; in particular the power law scalings discussed in subsection 2.6 would not be\nexpected to generalize. What we do hope will generalize is the structure of the argument\nin section 2 that the total number of configurations satisfying Eq. (5.1) is finite. This is\nagain clear at a single point in Kahler moduli space, since the supersymmetry condition\nEq. (5.3) forces an appropriate sum of the tadpole contributions to be positive. However\nwe would like an argument which does not use specific values of the K\u00e4hler moduli, and\nprovides a priori bounds. This is an important goal for future work.\n5.4 Rough estimate of number of configurations\nNeglecting the supersymmetry conditions and just looking at the general structure of the\ntadpole conditions Eq. (5.1), there is an obvious guess for the growth of the number of\nbrane configurations as a function of the total scale of the tadpoles T . We have to count\nchoices of the indices mai which satisfy b2 + 1 simultaneous quadratic conditions. If we take\nthese for a single brane to all to be of order m, a plausible first guess for the size of the\n\u221a\ntadpole contributions is m2 , and thus we can take m \u223c T . Since m for a single brane\nhas b2 components, we can estimate\nN\u0302 \u223c T b2 /2\nfor a one-stack model, with possible higher power laws for multi-stack models.\nThis one-stack estimate would already lead to very large numbers for typical CalabiYau manifolds with b2 \u223c 100, comparable to numbers of flux vacua. Indeed, taken at face\nvalue, this estimate would be far larger than the (2\u03c0L)b3 /(b3 )! estimate of [2], as it does\nnot have the factorial in the denominator. Fortunately, there are many possible sources of\nadditional b2 dependence, which could lead to such factors. In particular, in considering\nan explicit example in [23], it was found that the multiplicity of terms in the intersection\nform tends to make its value much larger (as b32 in the volume form), which could lead to a\nsizable suppression of the number, say to (T /b22 )b2 /2 . It will be interesting to get a better\nhandle on this.\n\n\u2013 49 \u2013\n\n\f6. Relevance for the problem of counting more general vacua\nIntersecting brane models are usually thought of as a special class of constructions, useful\nfor providing concrete examples, but not necessarily mapping out the full set of possibilities;\nindeed one might think they are a very small subset.\nA contrary intuition comes from the realization that almost all supersymmetric intersecting brane models contain many massless scalar fields, coming from open strings\nstretched between pairs of branes. Giving expectation values to these fields breaks part of\nthe four-dimensional gauge symmetry, and allows moving out into a larger moduli space of\nconfigurations. One might optimistically hope that the general brane configuration could\nbe obtained in this way.\nRealizing this goal in practice requires a good deal of technical control, in particular\nit requires knowing the world-volume superpotential. While this has been done for some\nnoncompact Calabi-Yau's (see for example [35, 4]), for compact Calabi-Yau manifolds it\nremains work in progress.\nHowever, one might imagine that since the brane configurations are special points in\nthese moduli spaces with enhanced symmetry, knowing all of them should give us some\nsort of global information about the moduli space. In this section we would like to propose\nan idea in this direction.\nWhat distinguishes the IBM brane configurations, is that they transform simply under\nthe symmetries of the compactification manifold. This is clear for hyperplanes in T 6 , which\nadmit an action of the group of translations on T 6 . In the IIb picture, the supersymmetric\nbranes correspond to constant curvature connections on line bundles over T 6 , for which\na translation acts as a gauge transformation. More generally, this condition defines the\nequivariant bundles, the class of branes we suggested earlier as a good IIb analog for general\ntoric hypersurface CY's of the branes usually used in constructing IBM's.\nWhat use can we make of this observation? Let us consider the problem of counting\nall of the stabilized vacua in such a theory, which are distinguished by the values of the\nopen string moduli. To do this, we would need not just the tree level world-volume superpotential, but the full superpotential with all non-perturbative corrections. We would\nthen count its critical points Di W = 0.\nAs discussed in [36, 2, 37], the number of critical points of the superpotential is quasitopological, in the following sense. One can construct an index which weights critical points\nwith a sign, which on a compact moduli space would be the integral of a topological density,\nZ\ndet(R + \u03c9).\n(6.1)\nindex =\nM\n\nThe same integral makes sense on a non-compact moduli space as well, and provides a\ngood estimate for the number of vacua for a generic superpotential.\nHow would one compute this? Somewhat analogous problems arise in the computation\nof instanton amplitudes in supersymmetric gauge theory [34, 52] and in other topological\nfield theories. In gauge theory, the k-instanton contribution to a \"protected\" coupling is\nan integral over k-instanton moduli space of a corresponding form, typically the volume\nform or the Euler form depending on the amount of supersymmetry.\n\n\u2013 50 \u2013\n\n\fNow, while instanton moduli spaces are complicated, the essential point which allows\ncomputing such integrals is that they and the integrands admit continuous symmetries\ngenerated by Hamiltonians, which allows the use of localization. The obvious symmetry at\nhand in gauge theory on Euclidean four-dimensional space is the lift of the SO(4) rotational\nsymmetry \u2013 since a rotation on a gauge field configuration takes it into an a priori different\ngauge field configuration, we get an action involving the corresponding points in moduli\nspace. The Hamiltonian nature of the action turns out to follow from that in Euclidean\nspace in an analogous way.\nThe simplest localization arguments (which sufficed for [52]) use only an abelian group\naction, say U (1)2 \u2282 SO(4). Without going into details, the simplest application of this\ntype of argument is the Duistermaat-Heckman formula, according to which the integral\nover an n-dimensional space M\nZ\nX\n1\n,\n(6.2)\n\u03c9 n eitH = t\u2212n/2\ndet S \u2032\u2032\nM\nfixed points\n\nwhere H is the Hamiltonian generating the U (1) symmetry, and det S \u2032\u2032 is the one-loop\ndeterminant obtained by expanding the integrand around a fixed point of the U (1) action.\nThe point is that, in favorable cases, the integral can be reduced to a sum over contributions from the fixed points of the U (1) symmetry. On the heuristic level of our discussion,\none can see various reasons why this might be applicable to the problem of counting vacua.\nFor example, we might take H itself as a model potential V = H. The fixed points of the\nisometry \u2202H = 0 would then be exactly the \"vacua\" V \u2032 = 0 we are trying to count. We\nthen appeal to the quasi-topological nature of Eq. (6.1), to argue that the index counting\nvacua is the same for a more generic choice of potential.\nNow, let us return to the problem at hand, of computing the number of stabilized\nvacua which can be found by starting with IBM's and varying open string moduli. As we\ndiscussed, these will be solutions of DW = 0 for a generic superpotential on the moduli\nspace M of holomorphic bundles (with specified Chern classes) on the Calabi-Yau manifold\nM . Since M is K\u00e4hler, this moduli space will be K\u00e4hler and thus symplectic. And by\ngeneral arguments, the index counting critical points DW = 0 will be the integral of the\ndensity Eq. (6.1) over this moduli space.\nNow, suppose for a moment that M admitted a continuous symmetry; then so would\nthe moduli space M. In particular, for M = T 6 , translations will act on M, and the\nequivariant bundles will be the fixed points. As we discussed in section 5, these are just\nthe type IIB description of the IBM's we have been counting.\nWhile a more general Calabi-Yau manifold will not have continuous symmetries, if we\nrestrict attention to the subset of bundles which restrict from an ambient toric variety,\nthe moduli space of such bundles will again admit a continuous symmetry, and again the\nequivariant bundles will be the fixed points. These include sums of line bundles and thus\nthe right hand side of a formula like Eq. (6.2) will include a sum over the IBM's defined in\nsection 5, as well as other IBM's constructed using higher rank equivariant vector bundles.\nIf these were fewer or comparable in number, and the 1/ det factors of order unity, the sum\ncould be estimated by simply counting IBM's.\n\n\u2013 51 \u2013\n\n\fThe main point of these heuristic arguments is that the IBM's are not arbitrary points\nin moduli space, but special points which carry information about the global topology of\nthe moduli space. While there would be many technicalities to address in trying to make\nsuch arguments precise, such as the presence of singularities, the computation of the 1/ det\nfactors, and so on, they suggest that the crude estimate \"number of vacua roughly equals\nnumber of IBM configurations\" might be reasonable for the open string sector.\n\n7. Conclusions\nIn this paper we have developed tools for systematically analyzing intersecting brane models. We have looked in detail at a particular toroidal orientifold and characterized the\ngauge groups and intersection numbers associated with intersecting brane models on this\nspace.\nWe have proven that there are a finite number of solutions of the Diophantine equations\narising from the supersymmetry constraint, so that there are a finite number of different\nintersecting brane constructions in this model. We have developed estimates for the number\nof configurations which contain a given gauge group. The number of models with a fixed\ngauge group scales polynomially in the tadpole constraint, and is suppressed by a factor\npolynomial in the sizes of the gauge group components.\nWe have looked at the distribution of intersection numbers which govern the number\nof generations of chiral matter fields charged under the gauge group living on the branes.\nWe found that generally the intersection numbers are almost completely independently\ndistributed, and that the expected magnitude of the intersection numbers scales as an\ninverse power of the size of the gauge group components. We found a mild suppression\nfor prime intersection numbers and enhancement of composite intersection numbers with\nmany factors.\nThere are several ways to use the methods we have developed here. Most concretely,\none can use the estimates and algorithms we have developed to first estimate the number\nof models with a given desired gauge group and matter constant, and then to explicitly\nconstruct the precise set of such models compatible with SUSY and other constraints\nin an efficient way. This gives a systematic way to build models which agree with certain\nproperties of the standard model, which can then be studied for further physics predictions.\nThe standard choice of the properties to reproduce are to get a gauge group containing the\nstandard model gauge group, three generations of matter, and two or more Higgs doublets.\nAdditional charged matter is usually allowed, but different works differ on the rules at this\npoint.\nThe T 6 /Z2 \u00d7 Z2 orientifold we have focused on has been the focus of much work of\nthis type and thus we can test our results against this work. Most constructions leading to\nthree generation standard models require turning on discrete B fields, a class which we have\nnot enumerated. However our estimates should apply to this case and suggest that there\nshould be about ten brane constructions which give three generation Standard Models. In\nfact, such models were systematically constructed in [19], where 11 such models were found.\nOther less generic constructions using branes invariant under the orientifold action led to\n\n\u2013 52 \u2013\n\n\f3-generation Pati-Salam models with U (4) \u00d7 U (2) \u00d7 U (2) gauge groups in [16, 50, 51].4 We\nfound another pair of such explicit constructions here using our understanding of the range\nof possibilities allowed. It would be worthwhile to understand the detailed phenomenology\nof these models better, and to complete the search for standard model-like IBM's which\ncan be realized in this orientifold.\nUsing the techniques we have developed here, it would be straightforward to automate\nsuch a search not only for the particular orientifold we have considered here, but for a\ngeneral toroidal orientifold. Carrying out a similar analysis for a broader class of CalabiYau orientifolds involves further issues which we have begun to address here, by setting out\nan approach to an analog of the intersecting brane model construction for type I strings\non general Calabi-Yau manifolds.\nAnother way to think about the analysis of this paper is as a snapshot of a piece of\nthe full string landscape. In [8] indications were found that some features of the standard\nmodel, such as the components of the gauge group and the number of generations of\ndifferent types of matter, could be dialed fairly independently. We have developed a more\ncomplete picture of the distribution of possibilities, and searched for correlations between\ndistinct intersection numbers using the information theoretic notion of mutual entropy. The\nresults fit with the idea that different intersection numbers are to a good approximation\nindependently distributed, as suggested in [36] and as emerged from the detailed studies\nof [8, 40].\nOne definite correlation which does emerge is that larger rank gauge groups come with\nmuch smaller intersection numbers, according to a power law I \u223c (tadpole/rank)\u03b1 with a\nlarge exponent \u03b1 \u223c 7.\nOf course, this is a very small sample even of type II orientifold models, and we would\nsuggest broadening the class of models (at least to general Calabi-Yau orientifolds) before\nascribing too much significance to these results. We should also keep in mind that the simple\nstatistical analyses we made can miss a great deal of structure. For example, anomaly\ncancellation fixes definite relationships between the numbers of generations of different\ntypes of matter which will be seen in the low energy theory. Since these conditions depend\non the total matter content, they do not lead to simple pairwise correlations. Perhaps\nother, more subtle structure of this type lies buried within the data.\nAs many have stressed, a noteworthy general feature of IBM's is that their gauge groups\ntend to be larger than that of the Standard Model, leading to new dynamics (if there is\nmatter charged under both the SM and the new gauge groups), and hidden sectors. Similar\nobservations about heterotic string constructions, such as the presence of extra U (1)'s and\nof course the second E8 as a hidden sector, go back to the mid-eighties (see [30] for some\nrecent statistical work on heterotic constructions). Clearly this would seem to be the most\npromising area for making interesting phenomenological predictions from this type of data.\nAs hypothetical examples, we might imagine eventually making statements such as \"the\nvast majority of known realistic string compactifications contain one or more extra U (1)'s,\"\nor contain extra matter charged under the Standard Model group, or hidden sectors with\n4\n\nSee also [43, 44] which constructed models with partial N = 1 supersymmetry.\n\n\u2013 53 \u2013\n\n\fcosmological implications, or something else. Admittedly, as long as realistic models exist\nin which such a property is not true, it would not be a \"Prediction\" whose non-discovery\nwould falsify string theory. However, it would be a \"prediction\" that would be worth\ntesting as we would know it fits well with string theory; indeed to the extent that other\nvacuum selection criteria (measure factors, anthropic selection or otherwise) turn out not\nto depend on a property, it seems entirely reasonable to say that a property realized in\nmore vacua is favored by string theory. In addition, such a property might correlate with\nother observables; conversely its non-discovery would be of great significance in narrowing\ndown the search for the correct vacuum.\nThere are many issues which must be addressed in order to make such predictions. On\nthe more phenomenological side, of course one needs additional input besides the charged\nmatter content to decide what part of the model is visible at accessible energies. Even\nthe simplest case of matter which is chiral under the SM group (and thus gets its mass\nfrom electroweak symmetry breaking), while generically ruled out by existing data, is not\nabsolutely excluded; these constraints (which do not require any string theory input) have\n(to our knowledge) not been spelled out completely in the literature.\nOn the more formal side, one has the problem that the number of possible hidden\nsectors for a given visible sector model is exponential in the difference between the tadpoles\nof the visible sector and the total tadpole number. This tends to make the problem of\nenumerating even the possible matter sectors arising from all string models intractable.\nThis motivates the style of analysis we made, in which one enumerates models with the\ncorrect visible sector, and settles for estimates for the number of possible hidden sectors.\nHowever, to the extent that one must make a detailed model-by-model study to determine\nwhich models are potentially consistent extensions of the Standard Model, this is not very\nsatisfying. To resolve this problem, we need simple and general criteria which tell us\nwhether a model is likely to work (or what degree of tuning is required to make it work),\nwithout using detailed information.\nAs an example which illustrates what we have in mind, it would be very useful to\nhave a simple criterion for a gauge sector to dynamically break supersymmetry. This has\nbeen much discussed in the literature, beginning with [1], under a \"strong\" definition of\nsupersymmetry breaking which requires a theory not to have supersymmetric vacua. Another definition, which fits much better with the landscape picture, is that any sufficiently\nlong-lived metastable supersymmetry breaking vacuum is acceptable. Since this can be\naccomplished by tuning the potential, one is not looking for a criterion which provides a\ndefinite \"yes/no\" answer, but instead tells us what fraction of the theories in a certain\nensemble are expected to break supersymmetry, and with what distribution of breaking\nscales. This type of question was addressed for IIb flux vacua in [24]; work such as [33, 32]\nand especially the recent [42] suggest that the time is ripe to address this question in gauge\ntheory.\nAnother important issue which we have not addressed in this paper is the interplay\nbetween the open string sector and the closed string sector, and the stabilization of moduli\nusing fluxes. In the vacua we have considered, there are both open string and closed\nstring moduli. Because of the open string moduli, the intersecting brane configurations we\n\n\u2013 54 \u2013\n\n\fhave constructed are just isolated points in a continuous moduli space. These points are\nrather special points with enhanced symmetry, and as we have discussed they may give\nsome characteristic understanding of the full moduli space, but in a complete theory we\nshould stabilize these moduli. This will naturally occur when the closed string moduli are\nstabilized by the inclusion of fluxes. While some literature, such as [7, 13, 51, 21, 20],\nhas begun to address the problem of stabilizing open string moduli in parallel with the\nstabilization of the closed string moduli by fluxes, a complete mathematical characterization\nof this problem is not yet available. The correct way to address this problem is to give\na global characterization of the open string moduli space in combination with the closed\nstring moduli space. Just as fluxes induce a superpotential on the closed string moduli\nspace, which stabilizes the closed string moduli as in [39], the same fluxes will induce a\nsuperpotential on the open string moduli space. A local description of this superpotential\non the open string moduli space was given in [41]. An important open problem is to develop\na global description of this superpotential and tools for computing supersymmetric solutions\nof the resulting equations of motion in which both open string and closed string moduli\nare fixed. This would give a true characterization of a class of string vacua which could be\nanalyzed for standard model-like properties.\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank Mirjam Cvetic, Bogdan Florea, Shamit Kachru, Gordy Kane,\nRobert Karp, Maximilian Kreuzer, Jason Kumar, Paul Langacker, John McGreevy, Nathan\nSeiberg, Steve Shenker, Gary Shiu, Eva Silverstein, Scott Thomas, Jay Wacker and James\nWells for helpful conversations.
