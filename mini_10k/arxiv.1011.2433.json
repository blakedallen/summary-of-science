BEZERRA\u2217\nAbstract. In this paper, a new method to compute a B\u00e9zier curve of degree n = 2m \u2212 1 is\nintroduced, here formulated as a Bernstein-Hankel form in Cm , that is, each coordinate of the curve\ne\ne\nT\ne\nis of the form eT\nm Bm (s)HBm (s) em , where Bm (s) is a m \u00d7 m lower triangular Bernstein matrix\nand H is a Hankel matrix. The method depends on Vandermonde factorizations of a regular Hankel\nmatrix, and so we begin with a proof, which utilizes Pascal matrices techniques, that given a regular\nHankel matrix H, there is a finite set of complex numbers \u03b3 such that xm \u2212 pm\u22121 xm\u22121 \u2212 ... \u2212 p0 has\nmultiple roots, where (p0 ... pm\u22121 ) = (hm+1 ... hn \u03b3) H \u22121 . Therefore, a Vandermonde factorization\nof H can be accomplished by taking a complex number at random, and the Bernstein-Hankel form\ncan be easily calculated, thus yielding points on the B\u00e9zier curve. We also see that even when H is\nnearly singular, the method still works by shifting the skew-diagonal of H. By comparing this new\nmethod with a Pascal matrix method and Casteljau's, we see that the results suggest that this new\nmethod is very effective with regard to accuracy and time of computation for various values of n.\nKey words.

Let H be a Hankel matrix of order n, i.e., (\u2200i, j \u2208 {1, ..., n})\nHij = hi+j\u22121 . A very known theorem says that, if H is nonsingular, then a Vandermonde matrix V and a diagonal matrix D exist such that H = V DV T . There\nis a proof of this fact in [9], which utilizes a class of matrices arisen in the theory\nof root separation of algebraic polynomials, namely the class of Bezoutians. Here, in\nsection $ 2, from a procedure that is currently utilized in linear prediction to estimate\nparameters in exponential modeling, it is showed that the spectrum of the companion\nmatrix C = C(x\u03b3 ), where x\u03b3 is the solution of the linear prediction system Hx = y\u03b3 ,\nwith y\u03b3 = (hn+1 ... h2n\u22121 \u03b3)T , is simple for all but a finite set of \u03b3. For the values\nbelonging to this finite set, there is a more general factorization: H = Vc DVcT , where\nVc is a confluent Vandermonde matrix and D is a block diagonal matrix, as it can be\nseen in [4]. Our approach to the proof of the Vandermonde factorization of a nonsingular Hankel matrix is very similar to the one found in [7], but the proofs are distinct.\nFor instance, we make here use of generalized Pascal matrices to quickly obtain some\ngeneral properties of Hankel matrices.\nIn section $3, we see that a B\u00e9zier curve of degree n \u2212 1, where n = 2m \u2212 1,\ncan be described as a Bernstein-Hankel form on Cm . Also, in this section a new\nalgorithm to compute B\u00e9zier curves is proposed, from a Vandermonde factorization\nof the associated Hankel matrix. In section $ 4, results of numerical experiments are\npresented, which strongly suggest that we can compute those curves in a very fast and\nprecise way. That is corroborated from the comparisons done with the Casteljau's\nmethod ([5]) with various values of n. On the other hand, however, several experiments indicate that the computation of Vandermonde factorization of a Hankel matrix\nis sensitive to its condition with respect to inversion. However, once its skew-diagonal\nentries are shifted toward skew-diagonal dominance the precision of the computation\n\u2217 Departamento de Matem\u00e1tica, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Florian\u00f3polis, SC, Brazil\n88040-900 (licio@mtm.ufsc.br).\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nL.

Let x\u03b3 be the\n\uf8ed hn\u22121\nhn\n... h2n\u22122 \uf8f8\nhn\nhn+1 ... h2n\u22121\nsolution of the linear prediction system Hx = y\u03b3 , where y\u03b3 = (hn+1 ... h2n\u22121 \u03b3)T . We\nwant to show that the set of \u03b3 \u2208 C for which the companion matrix C\u03b3 = compan(x\u03b3 )\nis not diagonalizable is finite. Since C\u03b3 is a nonderogatory matrix, it suffices to show\nthat S, the set of scalars \u03b3 such that the spectrum of C\u03b3 is not simple, is finite. This\nmeans that, out of this set, the characteristic polynomial of C\u03b3 , p\u03b3 (x), doesn't have\nmultiple roots. If a = (a0 ... an\u22121 )T and b = (b0 ... bn\u22121 )T are the respective solutions\nof Hx = en = (0 ... 0 1)T and Hx = (hn+1 ... h2n\u22121 0)T , then p\u03b3 (x) = r(x) \u2212 \u03b3s(x),\nwhere r(x) = xn \u2212 bn\u22121 xn\u22121 \u2212 ... \u2212 b1 x \u2212 b0 and s(x) = an\u22121 xn\u22121 + ... + a1 x + a0 . It\nis not difficult to see that S is finite iff r(x) and s(x) don't have any common root.\nLemma 2.1. Let H be a n\u00d7n nonsingular Hankel matrix. If a = (a0 ...an\u22121 )T and\nb = (b0 ...bn\u22121 )T are the respective solutions of Hx = en and Hx = (hn+1 ... h2n\u22121 0)T ,\nthen a0 6= 0 or b0 6= 0.\nProof.\nSuppose |H(1 : n \u2212 1, 2 : n)| 6= 0. Therefore, from Cramer's rule, a0 6= 0. Let\nx1 , ..., xn\u22121 be the unique scalars such that\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f6 \uf8eb\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nhn+1\nhn\nh2\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7 \uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n..\n..\nx1 \uf8ed ... \uf8f8 + ... + xn\u22121 \uf8ed\n\uf8f8.\n\uf8f8=\uf8ed\n.\n.\nh2n\u22122\n\nhn\n\nh2n\u22121\n\nHence, x = (x0 x1 ... xn\u22121 )T = \u03b3a + b is the solution of Hx = (hn+1 ... h2n\u22121 \u03b3)T ,\nwith x0 = 0, iff \u03b3 = x1 hn+1 + ... + xn\u22121 h2n\u22121 . For other complex numbers \u03b3,\nx0 = \u03b3a0 + b0 6= 0, that is, a0 6= 0 or b0 6= 0. Notice that a0 6= 0, and b0 = 0 iff\nx1 hn+1 + ... + xn\u22121 h2n\u22121 = 0.\nNow, suppose H(1 : n \u2212 1, 2 : n) = H(2 : n, 1 : n \u2212 1) is singular. First, since H\nis nonsingular, the dimension of span{H(2 : n, 1), ..., H(2 : n, n \u2212 1), H(2 : n, n)} is\n(n \u2212 1), as well as the dimension of span{H(1 : n \u2212 1, 1), ..., H(1 : n \u2212 1, n \u2212 1), H(1 :\nn\u22121, n)}. Hence, H(2 : n, n) \u2208\n/ span{H(2 : n, 1), ..., H(2 : n, n\u22121)}, whose dimension\nis n \u2212 2. On the other side, H(2 : n, n) \u2208 span{H(1 : n \u2212 1, 1), ..., H(1 : n \u2212 1, n)} =\nspan{H(1 : n \u2212 1, 1), H(2 : n, 1), ..., H(2 : n, n \u2212 1)}, and so, there exist x0 , ..., xn\u22121 ,\nwhere x0 is different from zero and unique, such that\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nhn\nh2\nh1\nhn+1\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec . \uf8f7\n\uf8ec . \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n..\n..\n\uf8f8.\n\uf8f8 = x0 \uf8ed .. \uf8f8 + x1 \uf8ed .. \uf8f8 + ... + xn\u22121 \uf8ed\n\uf8ed\n.\n.\nh2n\u22121\n\nhn\u22121\n\nhn\n\nh2n\u22122\n\nObserve that, in this case, for all \u03b3 \u2208 C, x0 = b0 6= 0, and a0 = 0.\nFrom the above proof, there can be at most one complex number \u03b3 such that\np\u03b3 (0) = \u2212b0 \u2212 \u03b3a0 = 0 We can also conclude from the lemma 2.1 that zero is not a\n\n\fOn the computation of B\u00e9zier curves\n\n3\n\ncommon root of r(x) = xn \u2212 bn\u22121 xn\u22121 \u2212 ... \u2212 b1 x \u2212 b0 and s(x) = an\u22121 xn\u22121 + ... +\na1 x + a0 .\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nh1\n...\nhn\nhn+1\n\uf8ec ..\n.. \uf8f7\n..\n..\n\uf8ec\n.\n. \uf8f7\n.\nNow, define H\u03b3\u03ba = \uf8ec .\n\uf8f7.

Then, except for one possible complex number \u03b3, p0 6= 0.\nNow, let \u03b1 be any complex number and q\u03b3 (x) = p\u03b3 (x + \u03b1) = r(x + \u03b1) \u2212 \u03b3s(x + \u03b1).\nIn an analogous way to the proof for \u03b1 = 0, it will be shown that r(\u03b1) and s(\u03b1) cannot\nbe both null because there can be only one complex number \u03b3 such that q\u03b3 (0) = 0.\nTo prove this, we introduce some notations and definitions in the following.\nDefinition 2.3.

Let H be a n \u00d7 n Hankel matrix and let Pn be the n \u00d7 n lower\ntriangular Pascal matrix. Then Pn HPnT is still a Hankel matrix.\nProof. The lemma obviously holds when n = 1.

Let H be a n \u00d7 n Hankel matrix and \u03b1 be a complex number.\nThen, Pn [\u03b1]HPn [\u03b1]T is still a Hankel matrix.\nProof. For \u03b1 = 0, the result follows from lemma 2.7. Let \u03b1 6= 0. Since from lemma\n2.4 Pn [\u03b1] = Gn (\u03b1)Pn Gn (\u03b1\u22121 ), where Gn (\u03b1) = diag (1, \u03b1, ..., \u03b1n\u22121 ), it suffices to show\nthat G(\u03b1)HG(\u03b1) is a Hankel matrix. But this is obviously true, for (G(\u03b1)HG(\u03b1)) ij =\nhi+j\u22121 \u03b1i+j\u22122 .\nNext we give a proof that r(x) and s(x) don't have any common root by using a\ngeneralized Pascal matrix technique.\nProposition 2.9.

Let \u03b3 \u2208 C and let p\u03b3 = (\u2212b0 \u2212 \u03b3a0 ... \u2212 bn\u22121 \u2212 \u03b3an\u22121 1) . Let q\u03b3 =\nT\n(q0 ... qn\u22121 1) be the vector of coefficients of the polynomial r(x + \u03b1) \u2212 \u03b3s(x + \u03b1).\nWe note that q\u03b3 = Pn+1 [\u03b1]T p\u03b3 = Pn+1 [\u03b1]T (H\u03b3\u03ba )\u22121 en+1 , for \u03ba = 1 + \u03ba0 . Thus,\nH\u03b3\u03ba Pn+1 [\u03b1]\u2212T q\u03b3 = en+1 , and so,\nb \u03ba q\u03b3 = Pn+1 [\u03b1]\u22121 H \u03ba Pn+1 [\u03b1]\u2212T q\u03b3 = Pn+1 [\u2212\u03b1]H \u03ba Pn+1 [\u2212\u03b1]T q\u03b3 = en+1 .\nH\n\u03b3\n\u03b3\n\u03b3\n\nb \u03b3\u03ba is also nonsingular and, from corollary 2.8, is a Hankel matrix.

Let p\u03b3 (x) = xn \u2212 bn\u22121 xn\u22121 \u2212 ... \u2212 b0 \u2212\n\u03b3(an\u22121 xn\u22121 +...+a0 ) = r(x)\u2212\u03b3s(x) the characteristic polynomial of C\u03b3 = H1 (\u03b3)H \u22121 ,\nwhere H1 (\u03b3) is the Hankel matrix defined by H1 (\u03b3)ek = Hek+1 for k = 1, ..., n \u2212 1\nand H1 (\u03b3)en = (hn+1 ... h2n\u22121 \u03b3)T , that is, C\u03b3 = [eT2 ; ...; eTn ; (hn+1 ... h2n\u22121 \u03b3)H \u22121 ].\nThen the set of scalars \u03b3 such that C\u03b3 is not diagonalizable is finite.\nProof. C\u03b3 is a companion matrix, and hence, a nonderogatory matrix. Thus, it\nsuffices to show that the set of scalars \u03b3 such that the spectrum of C\u03b3 is not simple\nis finite.\nLet \u03b1 \u2208 C be an eigenvalue of C\u03b3 , that is, a root of p\u03b3 (x). Therefore, r(\u03b1) =\n\u03b3s(\u03b1). Then, from proposition 2.9, s(\u03b1) 6= 0. So, there are two cases:\n(i) r(\u03b1) = 0, and this occurs iff \u03b3 = 0. In this case, C0 is not diagonalizable iff\nr\u2032 (\u03b1) = 0.\n(ii) r(\u03b1) 6= 0, which means that \u03b3 = r(\u03b1)/s(\u03b1). Therefore, p\u2032\u03b3 (\u03b1) = 0 iff\n\u2032\nr (\u03b1) = s\u2032 (\u03b1) = 0, or s\u2032 (\u03b1) 6= 0 and r\u2032 (\u03b1) = \u03b3s\u2032 (\u03b1).\nTherefore, since s 6= 0 and r/s is not a constant, \u03b1 is contained in the set of the\nroots of r\u2032 s \u2212 rs\u2032 , which has at most 2(n \u2212 1) elements. Hence, we can conclude that\n{\u03b3 \u2208 C | C\u03b3 is not diagonalizable} is finite and has at most 2(n \u2212 1) elements.\nWe can now state the following theorem:\nTheorem 2.11. Let H be a n \u00d7 n nonsingular Hankel matrix. Let r(x) =\nxn \u2212 bn\u22121 xn\u22121 \u2212 ... \u2212 b0 and s(x) = an\u22121 xn\u22121 + ... + a0 , where a = (a0 a1 ... an\u22121 )T\nand b = (b0 b1 ... bn\u22121 )T are such that Ha = en and Hb = (hn+1 ... h2n\u22121 0)T .

B\u00e9zier curve as a Hankel form. Efficient methods to compute B\u00e9zier\ncurves of degree n \u2212 1 ([3]) are fundamentals tools in Computed-Aided Geometric\nDesign area. The Casteljau's algorithm is a widespread method for this computation.\nHowever, for each s \u2208 (0, 1) it demands O(n2 ) multiplications. For n not very large,\nthere are more efficient methods, like the ones introduced in [10], where the computation of points on these curves is carried out by generalized Ball curves, or the ones\npresented in [2], which use fast Pascal matrix-multiplication. Here we show that we\ncan describe a B\u00e9zier curve as a Hankel form and, hence, we see that we can easily compute points of the curve from a Vandermonde factorization of the associated\nHankel matrix.\nLet Q0 = (x0 , y0 ), Q1 = (x1 , y1 ), ..., Qn\u22121 = (xn\u22121 , yn\u22121 ) be n points in R2 .\nB\u00e9zier has his name on the curve B defined from these n points as follows:\nB(s) =\n\n\u0012\n\nb1 (s)\nb2 (s)\n\n\u0013\n\n=\n\nn\u22121\nX\u0012\ni=0\n\n\u0013\nn\u22121 i\ns (1 \u2212 s)n\u22121\u2212i Qi ,\ni\n\ns \u2208 [0, 1].\n\nLet x = (x0 ... xn\u22121 )T and x = (y0 ... yn\u22121 )T .

There-\n\n4. Numerical experiments. We are going to compare B\u00e9zier curves of degree\n(n \u2212 1) computed from the classical Casteljau's algorithm as well as from two other\ndescriptions of the curve: as a Hankel form and by using the spectral decomposition\nBne (s) = Pn Gn (s)Pn\u22121 . We first observe that an uniform scaling of the control points of\na B\u00e9zier curve yields an uniform scaling of the curve and if those points are translated\nby a vector v = (p, q), then the B\u00e9zier curve is also translated by v. Hence, without\nloss of generality, we are going to assume that the coordinates of the control points\nare all real positive and also less than or equal to 1. So, we are going to use the\nMATLAB function rand to generate n test control points: A = rand(n, 2).\nThe Casteljau's algorithm is a very accurate algorithm to evaluate B\u00e9zier curves,\nfor it is based on a numerically stable Bernstein matrix-vector multiplication:\nAlgorithm 1 Casteljau's algorithm\nn = length(x);\nx = x(:);\nss = 1 \u2212 s;\nfor k = 2 : n do\nfor t = n : \u22121 : k do\nx(t) = ss*x(t-1) + s*x(t);\nend for\nend for\nb(s) = x(n)\n\n\f10\n\nL. H. Bezerra\n\nThis multiplication can be seen as a sequence of bi-diagonal matrix-vector multiplications, which becomes well explicit from the following lemma [2]:\nLemma 4.1. Let Bne (t) be a n \u00d7 n Bernstein matrix. Then\ne\nBne (s) = En\u22121\n(s)...E1e (s) where, for 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2212 1,\n\nEke (s) = e1 eT1 + ... + ek eTk + ek+1 [(1 \u2212 s)ek + sek+1 ]T + ... + en [(1 \u2212 s)en\u22121 + sen ]T .\nAnother way of calculating a B\u00e9zier curve is from its description as a Hankel\nform, which allows us to utilize a Vandermonde factorization of the associated Hankel\nmatrix, and its algorithm is as follows: We are supposing here that H x and H y\nAlgorithm 2 B\u00e9zier curve as a Hankel form\n\u2022 given n = 2m \u2212 1 distinct points of R2 , let H x and H y be two m \u00d7 m Hankel\nmatrices formed from their coordinates;\n\u2022 choose a number \u03b3 at random and define the vectors x\u03b3 = (hxm+1 ... hxn \u03b3)T\nand y\u03b3 = (hym+1 ... hyn \u03b3)T ;\n\u2022 solve the systems H x z\u03b3 = x\u03b3 and H y w\u03b3 = y\u03b3 and consider the companion\nmatrices Cz\u03b3 and Cw\u03b3 ;\n\u2022 find the spectra of Cz\u03b3 and Cw\u03b3 ;\n\u2022 define dx = (V\u03b3x )\u22121 H x e1 and dy = (V\u03b3y )\u22121 H y e1 , where V\u03b3x and V\u03b3y are Vandermonde matrices formed from the spectrum of Cz\u03b3 and from the spectrum\nCw\u03b3 , respectively;\n\u2022 for each s \u2208 [0, 1], the B\u00e9zier curve B(s) is then defined from the equation\n(3.2).\nare both nonsingular and that \u03b3 is not one of those numbers which yield in nondiagonalizable companion matrices.\nThe third way of computing a B\u00e9zier curve will be carried out by a Pascal matrix\nmethod, which computes a B\u00e9zier curve B(s) of degree n \u2212 1 via the decomposition\nBne (s) = Pn Gn (\u2212s)Pn Gn (\u22121):\nAlgorithm 3 Pascal matrix algorithm\n\u2022 given n, take t \u2265 1 such that Pn (t) is similar to a lower triangular Toeplitz\nmatrix T = T (t) with maximum min Tij / max T ij;\n\u2022 multiply z = Pn Gn (\u22121)x = Pn x\u2212 and w = Pn Gn (\u22121)y = Pn y\u2212 via fast\nToeplitz matrix-vector multiplication;\n\u2022 from a Horner-like scheme, evaluate the polynomials eTn Pn Gn (\u2212s)z and\neTn Pn Gn (\u2212s)w.\nWe have used a fast Pascal matrix-vector multiplication done from the similar\nToeplitz matrix T (t) (see [11]), where t has been found by a procedure described\nin [2], plus the B(s) evaluation given by a Horner-like scheme that evaluates the\npolynomial concomitantly with the binomial coefficients. Since the B(s)-evaluation\nbecomes unstable when s approaches to 1, we have introduced a simple procedure to\nimprove the evaluation, that is to divide the process of evaluation in two independent\nsteps:\n(a) evaluate eTn Pn Gn (\u2212s)z and eTn Pn Gn (\u2212s)w for 0 \u2264 s \u2264 1/2;\n\n\f11\n\nOn the computation of B\u00e9zier curves\n\n(b) evaluate eTn Pn Gn (\u2212s)zr and eTn Pn Gn (\u2212s)wr for 1/2 > s \u2265 0, which is equivalent to evaluate eTn Pn Gn (\u2212s)z and eTn Pn Gn (\u2212s)w for 1/2 < s \u2264 1.\nTable 4.1\nMean run time of computation of 129 points of a B\u00e9zier curve of degree N-1 by three different\nmethods: Casteljau's (C), Hankel form (H) and direct Pascal matrix method (P).

Conditioning a Hankel matrix. It is not rare n = 2m \u2212 1 numbers taken\nin the interval [0,1] at random result in an ill-conditioned m \u00d7 m Hankel matrix H.\nA simple way of handling this is to shift its skew diagonal in order to turn it into a\nskew-diagonal dominant matrix, H\u0303 = H + \u03c3C, where C is the reciprocal matrix. Let\nBH and BH\u0303 be the B\u00e9zier curves corresponding to H and H\u0303, respectively. Then, for\ne\ne\neach s \u2208 [0, 1], we compute BH (s) by subtracting \u03c3 times eTm Bm\n(s)Cm (Bm\n(s))T em\nfrom BH\u0303 . Moreover, this quadratic form has a simple formulation as can be seen in\nthe next lemma.\nLemma 4.2. Let Cm = hankel(em , eT1 ), which is called the reciprocal matrix.\nThen, if w = e2\u03c0i/m ,\nm\n\ne\ne\neTm Bm\n(s)Cm (Bm\n(s))T em =\n\n1 X j\u22121\nw (1 \u2212 s + s.wj\u22121 )n\u22121 .\nm j=1\n\nProof. It is easy to see that Cm = V DV T , where V = vander(1, w, ..., wm\u22121 ) and\nD = diag(1/m, w/m, ..., wm\u22121 /m). From the proof of Corollary 3.2,\nm\n\ne\ne\n(s))T em =\neTm Bm\n(s)V DV T (Bm\n\n1 X j\u22121\nw (1 \u2212 s + s.wj\u22121 )n\u22121 .\nm j=1\n\nIn table 4.2, we can see that this simple technique of preconditioning have improved the computation of B\u00e9zier curves when their control points yield ill-conditioned\nHankel matrices (cond(H) is the maximum condition number of the two Hankel matrices formed by the coordinates of the control points). For each Hankel matrix H,\n\u03c3 was taken as the sum of the absolute values of its entries. Since our Vandermonde\nfactorization of a Hankel matrix depends on a value chosen at random, the error\nbetween the curve computed by Casteljau's and the one computed from that factorization varied enormously when the Hankel matrices associated with the coordinates\nwere ill-conditioned. In table 4.2, for each n, we can see the maximum error among\n\n\f12\n\nL. H. Bezerra\n\nseveral experiments done. However, sometimes it happened to have a big error followed by a tiny one.
