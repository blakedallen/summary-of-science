There are several reasons why they are of such strong interest.\nFirstly, quantum antiferromagnetic spin chains are important examples of a larger class of strongly correlated systems,\nwhose ground state and low-energy behavior differ from their higher dimensional counterparts in qualitative ways. In\nthe case of AF spin chains, quantum fluctuations destroy the Neel order in the ground state no matter how big the\nthe size of the spin is, while in higher dimensions the Neel order is stable regardless of spin size, in the absence of\nfrustration. Secondly, the spin chains are of interest to physicists because they are ideal playgrounds for various types\nof theoretical approaches. A prominent example here is the work of Haldane1 , who mapped the AF spin chains to\nquantum non-linear sigma models, and predicted that the integer chains have a gap in their excitation spectra while\nno gap exists for half integer chains, based on the absence or presence of a topological term in the mapping. This\nfundamental difference is consistent with, and to certain degree implied in the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) theorem2 ,\nwhich states that for a Heisenberg AF chains with length L and periodic condition, for half-integer spins, there exists\nan excited state with energy separated from the ground state that is of order 1/L; no such theorem exists for integer\nchains however.\nThe studies of AF spin chains, and the results mentioned above, are restricted to models with short-range interactions. In this work we study AF chains with interactions that decay as power laws and without frustration:\nH=\n\nX\nij\n\n(\u22121)i\u2212j+1 Jij S i * S j ,\n\n(1)\n\nwith\nJij = J/|i \u2212 j|\u03b2 ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere J > 0 determines the overall energy scale of the system and \u03b2 is the power-law exponent that controls the\ndecay of the interaction. The factor (\u22121)i\u2212j+1 ensures that spins sitting on opposite sublattices have antiferromagnetic\ninteractions and those sitting on the same sublattice have ferromagnetic interactions, thus there is no frustration. Our\nmotivation of the study comes from the following considerations. Firstly, such power-law long-range interactions can\nin principle be realized in experimental systems; one example of which being the RKKY3 interaction mediated by\nconduction electrons that decay as power laws, with an exponent that depends on the details of the conduction\nelectron Fermi surface. Secondly, as we will show, such long-range interactions tend to suppress quantum as well as\nthermal fluctuations, thus increasing the range of interaction has an effect that is somewhat similar to increasing the\ndimensionality of the system. On the other hand the dimensionality is discrete while the power-law exponent for the\ninteraction can be tuned continuously, thus providing a tuning parameter for the fluctuations; it is of interest to study\nhow the system behave under such tuning.\nAnticipating the stability of Neel order in the presence of such long-range interactions, we study the models using\nthe spin-wave method. We obtain the following results. (i) We show the Neel order is stable at zero temperature for\n\u03b2 < 3 and sufficiently large S, justifying the usage of spin-wave method in this case. We also estimate the critical size\nof the spin for the Neel order to be stable, as a function of \u03b2. (ii) In this case the spin-wave excitation spectra take\nthe form \u03c9k \u223c k \u03b3 in the long wave-length, with \u03b3 < 1 and varying continuously with \u03b2. (iii) Extending the spin-wave\n\n\f2\ncalculation to finite temperature, we show that the Neel transition temperature TN is zero for \u03b2 \u2265 2 while finite for\n\u03b2 < 2. We determine TN as a function of S and \u03b2. (iv) For a finite-size system with size L and periodic boundary\ncondition, and \u03b2 \u2264 1, we find the lowest excitation energy approaches zero slower than 1/L as L increases for both\nhalf-integer and integer spins, thus \"violating\"the LSM theorem. Of course the LSM theorem applies to spin chains\nwith short-range interaction only; here we have provided explicit examples of how it is invalidated by the presence of\nlong-range interaction.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we discuss the application of spin wave technique\nto this model. In Sec.III and IV we present and discuss the significance of our results. In Sec. V we summarize our\nwork and discuss the implications of our results.\nII.\n\nTHE SPIN WAVE APPROACH\n\nWe consider a Heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain with unfrustrated power-law long-range interaction with the\nHamiltonian given by Eq. (1). The central issue we address in this work is the stability of Neel state at zero or\nlow temperature. It is thus natural to use the spin-wave method based on the Holstein-Primakoff transformation4\nthat maps spin operators to boson operators, and check its self-consistency. The procedure is rather standard;5 we\nnevertheless include the details here for the sake of completeness and establish notation for later treatment. We\ndivide the chain into two sublattices and represent the spin operators in terms two types of bosons : a bosons which\nlive on A sublattice and and b bosons which live on B sublattice. Up to order 1/S, where S is the size of spin, the\nHolstein-Primakoff transformation for the spin operators can be written as the following :\n\u221a\n\u221a\nSiz = S \u2212 a\u2020 a, Si\u2212 = 2Sa\u2020 (1 \u2212 a\u2020 a/(2S))1/2 \u2243 2Sa\u2020 ; i \u2208 odd\n\u221a\n\u221a\n(3)\nSiz = \u2212S + b\u2020 b, Si\u2212 = 2S(1 \u2212 b\u2020 b/(2S))1/2 b \u2243 2Sb; i \u2208 even.\nUsing this transformation, the Hamiltonian in Eq.

The same results can also be obtained by expanding the cos(nk) term to order\nk 2 in f (k):\nX\nX cos(nk) \u2212 1\n\u2243 \u2212k 2\nn2\u2212\u03b2 ,\n(15)\n\u03b2\nn\nn\nn\n\nin which the sum converges as long as \u03b2 > 3; together with a similar expansion for g(k) one reproduces Eq. (14).\nThe spin wave spectrum can be easily shown to be linear in k: \u03c9k \u221d k, and the T = 0 correction to the staggered\nmagnetization from long-wave length spin wave fluctuation:\nZ\ndk\n(16)\n\u2206mq \u223c\n\u03c9k\n\ndiverges logarithmically for \u03b2 > 3. This immediately indicates that the spin wave approach is not valid for \u03b2 > 3 at\nzero temperature. The results obtained here are essentially the same as the spin wave calculation for nearest-neighbor\ninteractions only.5\nFor \u03b2 = 3 the expansion we did above is no longer valid because the sum is divergent. We rely instead on the\nBose-Einstein\nintegral function as defined in Eq. (11) to calculate \u03c9k and \u2206mq . Afterpa little algebra we find\np\n\u03c9k \u223c k | log(k)| which leads to the correction of staggered magnetization that diverges as | log(L)|, where L is the\nsystem size. We thus conclude that the quantum fluctuation destroys Neel order, and the spin wave approach is not\nvalid for \u03b2 \u2265 3.\nB.\n\n1<\u03b2<3\n\nWe now turn our attention to the case 1 < \u03b2 < 3. As in \u03b2 = 3 case we are no longer able to expand the cos(nk)\nterm in f (k) and g(k) because the coefficient of k 2 is divergent so we again take advantage on the mapping onto the\nBose-Einstein integral function. In the long wave-length regime, the relations given in Eq. (6) read :\n\u03b1=2\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n1\n= 2(1 \u2212 2\u2212\u03b2 )\u03b6(\u03b2)\n\u03b2\n(2n\n\u2212\n1)\nn=1\n\u221e\nX\n\n1\n[cos(2nk) \u2212 1]\n\u03b2\n(2n)\nn=1\nh\ni\n= 22\u2212\u03b2 R(F (\u03b2, \u22122ik)) \u2212 \u03b6(\u03b2)\n\nf (k) = 4\n\n\u2243 \u2212\u03c6(\u03b2)k \u03b2\u22121\ng(k) = 2\n= 2\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n1\ncos(2n \u2212 1)k\n(2n\n\u2212\n1)\u03b2\nn=1\n\u221e h\nX\ncos(nk)\n\nn=1\n\nn\u03b2\n\n\u2212\n\n1\n\u2243 \u03b1 \u2212 \u03c6(\u03b2)k \u03b2\u22121 ,\n2\n\ncos(2nk) i\n(2n)\u03b2\n(17)\n\n\f5\nwhere the function \u03c6(\u03b2) is given by :\n\u03c6(\u03b2) =\n\n\u03c0\n1\n,\n\u0393(\u03b2) cos[\u03c0(\u03b2 \u2212 2)/2]\n\nwith \u0393(\u03b2) being the gamma function. The long wave-length spin wave spectrum is given by :\np\n\u03c9k \u2243 3\u03b1\u03c6(\u03b2)k (\u03b2\u22121)/2 ,\n\nwhich is sublinear, and T = 0 correction to staggered magnetization by :\ns\ns\ni\n\u03c6(\u03b2) 2\n1 h \u03b1(\u03b2) 2\n(3\u2212\u03b2)/2\n\u2206mq \u2243\n\u03c0\n+\n\u03c0 (1+\u03b2)/2 \u2212 \u03c0\n2\u03c0\n3\u03c6(\u03b2) 3 \u2212 \u03b2\n3\u03b1(\u03b2) 1 + \u03b2\n\n(18)\n\n(19)\n\n(20)\n\nwhich is convergent for \u03b2 < 3. These results show that the system supports gapless excitations, the spectrum follows\na sublinear power-law at small momentum k, and that the Neel order at zero temperature survives, for large enough\nS, for 1 < \u03b2 < 3. Our results agree with an earlier work presented by Parreira, Bolina, and Perez7 who show the\nexistence of Neel order for \u03b2 \u2265 3 and the presence of Neel order for \u03b2 < 3 at zero temperature using rigorous proof.\nHowever the excitation spectra were not studied in this work, nor was the critical value of S for the stability for Neel\norder calculated. Another support for our results at zero temperature is offered by the work of Aoki8 who studied\nthe same model we are studying for the case \u03b2 = 2 in 1D and 2D using spin wave theory. In that work he found that\nthere exists Neel order at zero temperature in 1 dimension for \u03b2 = 2 which is in agreement with our conclusion.\nWe may also estimate the critical size of the spin, Sc , above which the Neel order survives, by setting the correction\nto the staggered magnetization equal to the spin size: \u2206mq = Sc . As \u03b2 \u2192 3, \u2206mq is dominated by long-wave length\nspin-wave fluctuations, and we obtain\ns\ns\ni\n1 h \u03b1(\u03b2) 2\n\u03c6(\u03b2) 2\n0.41\nSc (\u03b2) \u2243\n,\n(21)\n\u03c0 (3\u2212\u03b2)/2 +\n\u03c0 (1+\u03b2)/2 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2243 \u221a\n2\u03c0\n3\u03c6(\u03b2) 3 \u2212 \u03b2\n3\u03b1(\u03b2) 1 + \u03b2\n3\u2212\u03b2\na result we expect to be asymptotically exact in the limit \u03b2 \u2192 3. On the other hand we also find the quantum\ncorrection gets suppressed very rapidly as \u03b2 decreases from 3; for examples we find Sc \u2243 1/2, for \u03b2 = 2.63 and Sc \u2243 1\nfor \u03b2 = 2.85, suggesting the Neel order would survive for any spin for \u03b2 . 2.6.\nWe also calculate the correction to staggered magnetization at finite temperature. First we discuss the case for\n\u03b2 > 2. The thermal correction to staggered magnetization is given by :\nZ\nh k 1\u2212\u03b2\n1 i\nkB T\n,\n(22)\n+\ndk\n\u2206mT (T ) \u2243\n2\u03c0JS\n3\u03c6(\u03b2) 3\u03b1\n\u221a\nwhich diverges as L\u03b2\u22122 for \u03b2 > 2. For \u03b2 = 2, it is a simple exercise to show that the spectrum\np behaves like \u03c9k \u223c k,\nand the small k contribution to the thermal correction of staggered magnetization diverges as | log(L)|. These results\nindicate that thermal fluctuations destroy the Neel order for \u03b2 \u2265 2 at any finite temperature. They are consistent\nwith an extension of the Mermin-Wagner theorem that Bruno advanced,9 which proves the absence of Neel order\nfor \u03b2 \u2265 2. For classical antiferromagnets in 1D, it has been shown, using Monte Carlo simulation, that there is no\nmagnetic ordering at finite temperature.10\nFor \u03b2 < 2 the correction to staggered magnetization is given by :\n\u2206mT (T ) \u2243\n\n\u03c0 (2\u2212\u03b2)\n\u03c0 i\nkB T h\n+\n\u03c0JS 3(2 \u2212 \u03b2)\u03c6(\u03b2) 3\u03b1\n\n(23)\n\nThis convergent correction shows that the Neel order survives at finite temperature for \u03b2 < 2. The Neel transition\ntemperature TN can also be estimated by applying the same rationale used to estimate the critical value of S at zero\ntemperature. By using Eq. (23) we find :\nTN (S, \u03b2) =\n\n\u03c0JS h\n\u03c0 i\u22121\n\u03c0 2\u2212\u03b2\n+\n.\nkB 3(2 \u2212 \u03b2)\u03c6(\u03b2) 3\u03b1\n\n(24)\n\nIn the limit \u03b2 \u2192 2, we find TN vanishes linearly:\nTN \u2243\n\n3\u03c0 2 JS\n(2 \u2212 \u03b2)\nkB\n\n(25)\n\n\f6\nWe see that increasing the range of interactions (or decreasing \u03b2) in the chains has effects that are similar to\nincreasing the dimensionality of the systems. For \u03b2 \u2265 3 we find absence of Neel order at both zero and finite\ntemperature, a genuine one-dimensional (1D) behavior. For 2 \u2264 \u03b2 < 3 we have finite Neel order at zero temperature\nwhich gets destroyed at any finite temperature, similar to the 2D situation. Finally for \u03b2 < 2 the Neel order is stable\nat zero and low-enough finite temperature, a behavior expected for dimensions above two.\nIn contrast to the antiferromagnetic case we are studying here, the ferromagnetic models with long range interactions\nhave been studied more extensively. Classical Heisenberg model with long range ferromagnetic interactions has a\nphase transition at finite temperature in 1 dimension when the interactions decay slower than 1/r2 . There is no phase\ntransition at finite temperature when the interactions decay faster than 1/r2 .11 This result for the classical case in\n1 dimension is confirmed by Monte Carlo simulation.12 The quantum Heisenberg model with long range interactions\nhave also been studied using the modified spin wave theory.13,14 It was shown that there exists a magnetic ordering\nin 1 dimension as long as the interactions decay slower than 1/r2 .\nC.\n\n\u03b2\u22641\n\nIn this section we consider the case \u03b2 \u2264 1. The reason we separate \u03b2 \u2264 1 case with the rest is because there are\ndivergences in the thermodynamic limit which require special care in their analysis. Physically, this is closely related to\nthe fact that the ground state energy grows faster than the system size (i.e., it becomes \"superextensive\"), if the local\nenergy scale J is not rescaled according to the system size. For this reason we will not discuss the finite temperature\n(or thermodynamic) properties of the system, as the definition of temperature becomes somewhat ambiguous; we will\nfocus instead on the ground state properties of the system, which is free of such ambiguity.\nFor the reasons mentioned we need to work explicitly with a finite system size L, defined as the number of spins\nper sublattice (so the total number of spins is 2L), and treat k and L as two independent variables. For a start, the\nsummation in \u03b1\n\u03b1=2\n\nL/2\nX\n\n1\n,\n(2n\n\u2212\n1)\u03b2\nn=1\n\n(26)\n\ndiverges for \u03b2 \u2264 1 if we run the summation to infinity.

We introduce:\nX\nSA =\nSi,\ni\u2208A\n\nSB =\n\nX\n\nSi,\n\n(35)\n\ni\u2208B\n\nwhere S A (S B ) is the total spin operator for sublattice A(B), to rewrite the Hamiltonian in the following form :\nh\n\u0010X\n\u0011i\nX\nH = J S A * S B \u2212 ((S 2A + S 2B )) +\n(36)\n(S i )2 +\n(S i )2 .\ni\u2208A\n\ni\u2208B\n\nWe define the total spin operator S tot = S A + S B to further simplify the Hamiltonian given above to become :\nh1\ni\n3\nH = J S 2tot \u2212 (S 2A + S 2B ) + 3L/2 .\n(37)\n2\n2\n\n\f8\nThe Hamiltonian in Eq. (37) can be diagonalized in the total-S basis of states given by |(SA , SB ); Stot > where\nSA (SB ) and Stot are the total spin quantum number in sublattice A(B) and in the system respectively. Using this\nbasis, the energy can be easily obtained as :\nE=J\n\nh1\n\ni\n3\nStot (Stot + 1) \u2212 (SA (SA + 1) + SB (SB + 1)) + 3L/2 .\n2\n2\n\n(38)\n\nTo minimize the energy we must have all spins aligned in each sublattice and have a minimum of Stot . This means\nthat Stot = 0 and SA = SB = LS, where S is the spin size, will minimize the energy and give us the ground state.\nThe momentum quantum number of the ground state is 0 (\u03c0) for even (odd) L. The lowest energy excited state is\nobtained by having Stot = 1 while still maintaining maximum SA and SB . The energy gap is given by :\n\u2206E = Eex \u2212 Egs = J.\n\n(39)\n\nThis particular excited state has a momentum quantum number that differs from the ground state by \u03c0, which\ncorresponds to momentum k = 0 in the spin wave approach, due to the doubling of the unit cell in that approach.\nWe will say more about this in the next section. To obtain excitations with generic k however, we must change\neither the SA or SB quantum numbers. There exist two branches of degenerate low-lying excitations, corresponding\nto SA = LS \u2212 1 or SB = LS \u2212 1 and Stot = 1, with excitation energy\n\u2206E = Eex \u2212 Egs = J(1 + 3LS),\n\n(40)\n\nwhich grows linearly with system size, and has no k-dependence. This result agrees with the spin wave solution\nobtained earlier in the limit S \u2192 \u221e, as expected.\nIV.\n\nEXCITATIONS AT k = 0 AND STATUS OF THE LIEB-SCHULTZ-MATTIS THEOREM\n\nThe Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) theorem2 states that for half-integer spin chains with length L and short-range\ninteraction, there exist an excited state whose momentum differs from the ground state by \u03c0, with energy that\nvanishes at least as fast as 1/L as L \u2192 \u221e.2 Recently the theorem has been extended to spin chains with power-law\nlong range interaction, and it was found that the theorem remains valid for \u03b2 > 2.15,16 The situation is unclear for\n\u03b2 \u2264 2.\nIn this section we check if the LSM behavior still holds for \u03b2 \u2264 2, using the spin-wave method. As discussed above,\ndue to the doubling of the unit cell, excitations whose momenta differ from the ground state by either \u03c0 or 0 show\nup as k = 0 excitation in the spin-wave approach. If one blindly use the linear spin-wave results however, one would\nalways find Ek=0 = 0. But this is an artifact of the linear spin-wave approach which maps the k = 0 modes to\nharmonic oscillators without a restoring force. Thus in order to study the excitation that are relevant to the LSM\ntheorem, we must treat the k = 0 modes more carefully.\nTo do that, we start by rewriting the Hamiltonian as given in Eq. (1) in the momentum space:\n\u0011\nXX\u0010\nXX\nB\nB \u2212ik*\u03b4 2\nA\nA \u2212ik*\u03b4 2\nB \u2212ik*\u03b4 1\n,\n(41)\ne\n*\nS\n+\nJ(\u03b4\n)S\n*\nS\ne\nJ(\u03b4\n)S\n\u2212\n2\n*\nS\ne\nJ(\u03b41 )S A\nH=\n2\n2\n\u2212k\nk\n\u2212k\nk\n\u2212k\nk\nk\n\nk\n\n\u03b41\n\n\u03b42\n\nwhere\nA/B\n\nSi\n\n1 X A/B \u2212ik*xi\n=\u221a\n,\nSk e\nL k\n\n(42)\n\nand A(B) denotes odd(even) sublattice. Instead of applying the Holstein-Primakoff mapping for all terms in H, we\nseparate out the k = 0 term in H and apply Holstein-Primakoff mapping to the k 6= 0 terms only. Since to linear\norder the k = 0 term commutes with the other terms in H, they can be diagonalized independently. The spin wave\ntreatment for the k 6= 0 terms gives the spectra obtained earlier, except that k must be nonzero. On the other hand\nthe k = 0 term\n\u0010X \u0011 \u0010X \u0011 1 X\nh\u0010 X \u00112 \u0010 X \u00112 i\n1X\nHk=0 =\nJ(\u03b41 )\nJ(\u03b42 )\nSi *\nSi \u2212\nSi +\nSi\nL\nL\ni\u2208A\ni\u2208B\ni\u2208A\ni\u2208A\n\u03b41\n\u03b42\n\u0011\n\u0010\n1X\n1X\n(43)\nJ(\u03b41 )S A * S B \u2212\nJ(\u03b42 ) S 2A + S 2B ,\n=\nL\nL\n\u03b41\n\n\u03b42\n\n\f9\ntakes a form identical to the Hamiltonian for \u03b2 = 0 that was solved exactly in the previous section. We can easily\nsolve this Hamiltonian to obtain the excitation energy at momentum \u03c0 measured from the ground state momentum,\nor k = 0 for the doubled unit cell:\n\u2206E =\n\nJ\u03b1\n,\nL\n\n(44)\n\nwhere \u03b1 depends on the power law exponent \u03b2 and is given by Eq. (6). For \u03b2 > 1, \u03b1 is convergent in the large L\nlimit and is given by Eq. (14). This means that the energy of the excited state vanishes as 1/L as L \u2192 \u221e. For \u03b2 = 1,\n\u03b1 diverges as ln(L) as shown in Eq. (26) and the energy vanishes as log(L)/L. For \u03b2 < 1, \u03b1 diverges as L1\u2212\u03b2 as\nshown again in Eq. (26) and the excitation energy vanishes as L\u2212\u03b2 . We thus find that the LSM behavior holds for\n1 < \u03b2 \u2264 2, despite the the absence of a proof for this range of \u03b2. On the other hand the LSM theorem is \"violated\"\nfor \u03b2 \u2264 1.\nV.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nWe have studied antiferromagnetic chain with unfrustrated long range interaction using the spin wave technique.\nWe find that this approach is valid for \u03b2 < 3 at zero temperature for sufficiently large size of spin, and \u03b2 < 2 for\nsufficiently low finite temperature, due to the stability of Neel order. Within the range of validity of this approach\nwe find that the system has a gapless excitation and the excitation spectrum follows a non trivial k dependence. We\nalso study how the excitation gap closes in this system in the limit L \u2192 \u221e, and find a behavior that is in contrast to\nthat predicted by Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem for chains with short range interactions, when \u03b2 \u2264 1.\nAcknowledgments\n\nOne of us (KY) thanks the Max Planck Institute for Physics of Complex Systems in Dresden and Aspen Center for\nPhysics for hospitality, where parts of this work were performed, and Ian Affleck for helpful discussions.
