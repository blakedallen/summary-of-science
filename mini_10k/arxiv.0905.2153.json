Introduction\nCoronal mass ejections (CMEs) are large scale eruptions of plasma and magnetic\nfield which propagate from the Sun into the Heliosphere. A typical CME has a\nmagnetic field strength of \u223c50 nT, a mass in the range of 1013 \u20131016 g (Vourlidas\net al., 2002) and velocity between \u223c10 and \u22652500 km s\u22121 close to the Sun\n(Gopalswamy, 2004). At 1 AU, CMEs velocities (300\u20131000 km s\u22121 ) tend to be\ncloser to the solar wind speed (Lindsay et al., 1999; Wang, 2005; Gopalswamy,\n2007). Although CMEs often exhibit a three-part structure which consists of a\nbright front followed by a dark cavity and bright core, they may also exhibit\nmore complex structures (e.g., Pick et al., 2006).\nThe full dynamical evolution of CMEs includes three phases; initiation, acceleration and propagation (Zhang et al., 2001). The initiation phase involves a slow\nbuild up of energy through various mechanisms, such as shearing (e.g., Mikic and\n1 School\n\nof Physics, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin 2, Ireland.\nemail: maloneys@tcd.ie\n\nSOLA: maloney_20090331_pub.tex; 13 November 2018; 5:25; p. 1\n\n\fLinker, 1994; Amari et al., 1996) or flux emergence and flux cancellation (e.g.,\nAmari et al., 2000; Krall et al., 2001). A number of models, such as the \"magnetic\nbreakout\" model (Antiochos, DeVore, and Klimchuk, 1999; Lynch et al., 2008)\nand the flux rope model (Chen, 1996), have been developed which predict both\ndynamics and observable features during both the initiation and acceleration\nphases (see Forbes et al., 2006 for a recent review). During the propagation\nphase, the bulk of the acceleration has ceased, but in situ measurements at 1 AU\nshow CMEs tend towards the solar wind velocity. This residual acceleration has\nbeen modelled in the context of a \"drag\" force, for example, the \"snow plough\"\nmodel (Tappin, 2006) and aerodynamic drag model (Cargill, 2004).\nDuring the SOlar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) era CMEs could\nonly be routinely observed in white light up to \u223c32 R\u2299 using the Large Angle\nSpectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO; Brueckner et al., 1995), and sometimes\nto Earth using the Solar Mass Ejection Imager (SMEI; Jackson et al., 2004;\nHoward et al., 2007). Shocks driven by CMEs are observed in radio data, which\nrely on model densities to relate the observations to heights in the corona and\nprovide no information on the direction of propagation. Some work has been\ndone using radio data from two observatories to reconstruct three dimensional\n(3-D) positions from radio triangulation (for example Reiner et al., 1998 and\nReiner et al., 2007). Another possibility to track CMEs over large distances is\nduring fortunate quadrature observations such as SOHO-Sun-Ulysses (Bemporad\net al., 2003). CMEs have also been tracked out into the Heliosphere using in situ\nmeasurements from various spacecraft such as Wind, ACE, Ulysses, Cassini,\nVoyager 1 and 2 (Lario et al., 2005, Richardson et al., 2005, Gopalswamy et al.,\n2005 and references therein). Howard and Tappin (2008) used a triangulation\nmethod on observations from SOHO/LASCO and the Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO) spacecrafts to obtain CME positions in 3-D. To\nidentify events over interplanetary distance scales, when neither radio or quadrature observations are available, it is necessary to compare the the coronagraph\nimages with in situ data. The relation between images and the in situ data is\ncomplex: Coronagraphs image solar radiation which has been Thomson scattered\nby electrons in the CME; in situ measurements provide the actual densities and\nmagnetic field of the part of the CME which passes over the instrument (flank\nor nose). All of this is compounded when multiple events occur in a short time\nframe. Also, coronagraphs produce images that are subject to projection effects\nwhich is one of the leading sources of uncertainty in determining kinematics\n(Howard, Nandy, and Koepke, 2008).\nObservations from one perspective only have information about two of the\nthree spatial dimensions. This has serious implications for many solar observations. For example, in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) single perspective images,\nthe tilt and height of loops is ambiguous and therefore the loop length and\nscale heights can not be determined accurately (Aschwanden et al., 2008). In\ncoronagraph images, only the component of height in the plane of sky is measured. Using stereoscopy techniques the reconstruction of the 3-D coordinates\nof features identified in images from two vantage points is a well defined linear\nproblem (Inhester, 2006). The biggest challenge in using this method is the\nidentification and matching of features in stereo image pairs. Tracking the true\n\nSOLA: maloney_20090331_pub.tex; 13 November 2018; 5:25; p. 2\n\n\f3-D trajectories of CMEs will facilitate comparison between observations and\ntheory, and is necessary in order to better understand CME acceleration and\npropagation. From a space weather perspective, full 3-D reconstruction of CME\ntrajectories will enable more accurate estimates of CME arrival times at 1 AU\n(Owens and Cargill 2004).\nThe launch of the twin STEREO spacecraft in December 2006 has provided\nsuch dual vantage point observations of the Sun allowing 3-D reconstruction of\nsolar features. The two perspectives of the spacecraft allow for the stereoscopic\nreconstruction of features in EUVI (Aschwanden et al., 2008), and the same 3-D\nreconstruction can be applied to the COR1/2 images to provide 3-D data out to\n15 R\u2299 . By assuming that CMEs follow the same trajectories in the x \u2212 y plane\n(ecliptic plane) in the HI field-of-view (FOV) as in the COR1/2 FOV, the true\nposition of the CME may be tracked from the Sun out to \u223c1 AU and beyond.\nThis addresses the effects of projection in coronagraph images (which is even\nmore important in the HI FOV), and the lack of consistent observations in the\ninner Heliosphere Owens and Cargill 2004).\nIn Section 2, the observations and their reduction and analysis are discussed.\nThe 3-D reconstruction methods for the COR and HI instruments are described\nin Section 3. The extrapolation of the coordinates into the HI FOV using the\nCOR data is also explained in this section, while the Appendix contains the\ndetails of the coordinate transformations for the HI and COR instruments. In\nSection 4, of four sample events are presented. Section 5 contains a discussion\nof the results, the conclusions drawn, and future work.\n\n2. Observations and Data Reduction\n2.1. Observations\nIn this paper we present a sample of four CMEs observed by the STEREO/SECCHI\ninstrument suites on both the Ahead (A) and Behind (B) spacecraft. The dates\nof the observations are 8-13 October 2007, 25-28 March 2008, 9-10 April 2008\nand 9-13 April 2008.\nThe inner SECCHI coronagraph, COR1, is a Lyot internally occulted refractive telescope which images the white light corona from 1.4\u20134 R\u2299 with 7.5 arcsec\npixel\u22121 plate scale (Howard et al., 2008). The COR2 instrument is an externally\nocculted Lyot coronagraph, of similar design to that of the SOHO/LASCO\nC2 and C3 coronagraphs, which images the corona from 2.5\u201315 R\u2299 with 14.7\narcsec pixel\u22121 (Howard et al., 2008). Both COR1 and COR2 take sequences\nof three polarised images at 0\u25e6 and \u00b160\u25e6 degrees for a complete polarisation\nsequence. This results in a cadence of 8 and 15 minutes respectively. These\nimages are telemetered to the ground where they can be combined to give both\ntotal brightness (B) and polarised brightness (pB) images.\nThe HI instrument is a combination of two refractive optical telescopes (HI1\n& HI2) with a multi-vane, multi stage light rejection system. HI1 has a FOV\nof 20\u25e6 degrees centred on an elongation of 13.28\u25e6 degrees with 70 arcsec pixel\u22121\nplate scale, while HI2 has a FOV of 70\u25e6 degrees centred on an elongation of\n\nSOLA: maloney_20090331_pub.tex; 13 November 2018; 5:25; p. 3\n\n\f53.36\u25e6 degrees from the Sun with 4 arcmin pixel\u22121 plate scale. The HI baffle\nsystem provides extremely high stray light rejection levels of 3 \u00d7 10\u221213 B\u2299 and\n3 \u00d7 10\u221214 B\u2299 for HI1 and HI2 which is needed to image the CMEs. In order\nto attain the required signal-to-noise ratio needed to image the extremely faint\nCMEs, the HIs take long exposure images. Due to limited dynamic range, and to\navoid cosmic ray swamping, a series of shorter exposures are taken and summed\non-board: In the case of HI1, this means that 30 images of 40 second exposure are\nsummed (total exposure time 1200 s) to give images at a cadence of 40 minutes;\nfor HI2 99 images with a 50 second exposure time are summed (total exposure\ntime 4950 s) leading to an image cadence of 2 hours. As neither HI1 or HI2 have\nshutters, all images must be corrected for the smearing caused by shutterless\nreadout (each row sees the scene from the pixel below it). Finally some of the\nobjects in the HI FOV are bright enough to saturate the CCD, these bleed along\ncolumns which allows them to be identified later (Eyles et al., 2008).\n2.2. Data Reduction\nThe data were reduced and calibrated using secchi prep.pro from the SECCHI\ntree within the SolarSoft library (Freeland and Handy, 1998). This consisted\nof de-biasing and application of flat-field corrections for all data. For both\nCOR1 and COR2 data, additional corrections for exposure time, vignetting\nand an optical distortion were carried out. Furthermore, for COR1, a model\nbackground was subtracted to remove the static corona. The HI data required\nadditional corrections for the smearing and pixel bleeding (Section 2.1). Columns\nwith bleeding were and then replaced with a known value. Finally, the pointing\ninformation in the HI FITS headers were updated with pointing information\nderived from the star fixes in the images (Brown, Bewsher, and Eyles, 2008).\nAll of the images were left in units of digital numbers, with the exception of the\nHI data which is implicitly converted to digital numbers per second when the\nshutterless correction is applied.\n2.3. Data Processing\nThe data were processed further to enhance the faint transient CME features.\nThe COR1 and COR2 images were processed in a similar manner. First the data\nwere clipped so that all non-coronal pixels (occulter and edge of the CCD) are\nset to a known value. The images were also normalised by dividing each image by\nits mean to reduce image-to-image intensity variation and facilitate production\nof better running difference images. After this, a further background was created\nby taking the median of the data cube along the time axis and subtracted to\nremove more semi-stationary coronal features. A running difference sequence was\nthen made by subtracting the previous image from the current one. This was\nthen median filtered and re-scaled.\nFor HI, different processing methods were applied as a typical CME is only\n\u223c 1% of the natural background of the images. The star fields in the FOV of\nthe instrument can be approximated as constant over an exposure time, but\nthere will be a shift due to the motion of the satellite. If the offset between two\n\nSOLA: maloney_20090331_pub.tex; 13 November 2018; 5:25; p. 4\n\n\fsubsequent images can be found, then the images can be shifted and subtracted\nand only transient features will be left\n\u2206I (x, y)i = I (x, y)i \u2212 I (x + \u03b1, y + \u03b2)i\u22121\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b1 and \u03b2 are the x and y offsets found by the cross correlation. However, the\npresence of a geometrical optical distortion in the HI images makes this difficult.\nA method to approximate this offset was developed . This involved extracting a\nregion (512 \u00d7 512) at the image centre, where the distortion is at a minimum, and\nperforming a local cross-correlation in a running window (128 \u00d7 128) around this\nsub-image. The average offset from this procedure was used to shift the image.\nThe resulting running difference images were then median filtered.\n\n3. 3-D Reconstruction\nThe reconstruction of 3-D information from images of an object observed from\ntwo different perspectives is well studied and the general reconstruction methods\nare well developed. The technique used in this study relies on the epipolar\nconstraint which states that any feature identified on an epipolar line in one\nstereo image must lie along the same epipolar line in the other stereo image (Inhester, 2006). An epipolar line is the projection of the epipolar plane (the plane\ncontaining the two observers STEREO A, B and the point to be reconstructed,\nP; see top panel of Figure 1) in the stereo images.\nOne possible implementation of this method of stereoscopy is outlined below.\nWe implicitly assume that two simultaneous observations of a feature (the point\nP; see top panel of Figure 1) from two different perspectives are available. If\nthe feature is identified in one of the images, from A for example, the angles \u03b8xA\nand \u03b8yA can be derived and the only unknown is the the depth of the feature or\nthe distance along the line-of-sight d (see bottom panel of Figure 1). One can\narbitrarily pick two values for d thereby giving two points in 3-D space which\ncan then be transformed into Heliocentric-Cartesian coordinates using:\nx = d cos (\u03b8y ) sin (\u03b8x )\n\n(2)\n\ny = d sin (\u03b8y )\nz = D\u2299 \u2212 d cos (\u03b8y ) cos (\u03b8x )\n\n(3)\n(4)\n\nwhere d is the distance along the line-of-sight, \u03b8xA and \u03b8yB are the inclination\nangles of the line-of-sight with respect to the Sun-spacecraft line in the x \u2212 y\nand x\u2212z planes and D\u2299 is the distance to the Sun. Finally, these are transformed\ninto a suitable coordinate system for the reconstruction, such as HeliosphericEarth-Ecliptic (HEE).\nThe coordinates of this line, as viewed from the second perspective, can then\nbe derived by reversing the procedure and the epipolar line over-plotted on the\nsecond image. If the position of the same feature along this epipolar line can be\nfound, this gives all the information needed to complete the reconstruction. The\nsame procedure is carried out for this second point, selecting two values of d and\n\nSOLA: maloney_20090331_pub.tex; 13 November 2018; 5:25; p. 5\n\n\fZ\n\nP\nX\n\nd\n\nY\n\nSTEREO B\n\nSTEREO A\n\nX\n\nP\n\nY\n\n\u03b8x\n\nB\n\nSTEREO B\n\n\u03b8x\n\nA\n\nSTEREO A\n\nFigure 1.

In the HI FOV, the CMEs are at a large distances from the Sun so\nwe assume that the CME will propagate pseudo-radially, continuing along the\ntrajectory that it followed in the COR1/2 FOV. Based on this assumption, we\nuse the best fit of the trajectory COR1/2 data in the x \u2212 y (ecliptic) plane and\nconstrain the CME to propagate along this fit. The equations are solved for the\npoint of intersection between this fit line and the observed line-of-sight yielding\nthe x, y position. The z coordinate is then calculated by assuming two distances\nalong the line-of-sight to find the equation of the line with respect to x or y, and\nsubstituting in relevant coordinate calculated yields the corresponding z value.\nThe apex of the CME was identified using point-and-click methods. These\npoints were then used to calculate the 3-D coordinates as outlined above (see\nthe Appendix for further details). From these, we calculated the CME launch\nangles with respect to the ecliptic plane, and in the ecliptic plane with respect\nto the Sun-Earth line.

If the number of points in the individual fields-of-view\nare too small this approach will not work. Figure 2, a sample of images from the\n2007 8-13 October event for COR2 and HI2 is shown. The COR2 data is well\ndescribed by a normal distribution with 38.09 % of the data lying outside of one\n\u03c3, the outliers are well distributed through the event showing the polynomial fit\nthe data trend well (see left of Figure 2). There are more data points in the HI2\nFOV explaining the better statistics with 23.33 % of data point lying out side of\none \u03c3. For HI2 most of the outliers are clustered at the end of the event, due to\nthe fact the CME front becomes extremely faint and hard to identify (see right\nof Figure 2).\n\n4. Results\nThe velocities of the CME were calculated using two methods, a plane of the\nsky assumption from A and B, and from the 3-D reconstruction. In both cases\nthis was accomplished by using the first and last data points in the COR2 FOV\nusing v = hmax \u2212 hmin /tmax \u2212 tmin where h and t are the heights and times of\nthe first and last observations. The velocities on larger time/distance scales were\nalso estimated using the first COR2 data point and the last data point (from\nHI1 or HI2) in the same procedure.\n4.1. Event 1: 8-13 October 2007\nThis event was first observed in COR1 B on 2007 October 8 at 10:15 UT off\nthe west limb, but was extremely faint in images from both spacecraft such that\nthe COR1 data was not used for the 3-D reconstruction (see Figure 3). The first\ndata point used for the 3-D reconstruction was observed at 15:52 UT on the\nsame day by COR2 A and B instruments, the last data point was observed at\n04:10 UT on 2007 October 13 by the HI 2 B instrument. From the 3-D data, the\n\nSOLA: maloney_20090331_pub.tex; 13 November 2018; 5:25; p. 12\n\n\flaunch angle in the x \u2212 y plane was found to be 56\u25e6 (where 0\u25e6 corresponds to an\nEarth directed CME and 90\u25e6 to a CME off the western limb), thus this was a\nfront side event (see Figure 7). The CME also had an out of ecliptic component\nof 11\u25e6 (where 0\u25e6 corresponds to in ecliptic while 90\u25e6 corresponds to solar north).\nThe velocity in the COR2 FOV as viewed from A was found to be 191 km s\u22121\nfrom B, 157 km s\u22121 , and from the 3-D reconstruction, 217 km s\u22121 . The average\nvelocity over the entire event was was found to be 420 km s\u22121 . The true height\nwas tracked from 5.7\u2013239.4 R\u2299 with an estimated error of 0.15 R\u2299 , 0.25 R\u2299\nand 2 R\u2299 in COR2, HI1 and HI2 respectively. The morphology evolves from a\nnearly circular loop-like structure in COR1 B and COR2 A and B to a elliptical\nstructure with much larger extent in the vertical than the horizontal direction in\nHI1 (see Figure 3). In HI2, the front evolves from nearly linear to a concave front\nwhere the wings/flank of the CME are ahead of the centre, what was originally\nthe CME apex (see Figure 3). There is some indication of a multiple loop-like\nfeatures in COR2 A, HI1 B and HI 2 B (see Figure 3) apparent in movies of the\nevent.\n4.2. Event 2: 25-28 March 2008\nThe second event was first observed on 2008 March 25 at 18:55 UT in both COR1\nA and B off the east limb, the last data point used was observed at 02:09 UT on\n2008 March 27. The CME was well observed in COR1 A and B but was somewhat\nfaint and diffuse in COR2. The CME launch angle in the x \u2212 y plane was found\nto be \u221274\u25e6, which corresponds to a front side event, while the angle with respect\nto the ecliptic plane was \u221222\u25e6 (see Figure 8). The velocity in the COR2 FOV\nas viewed from A was found to be 863 km s\u22121 , from B, 1010 km s\u22121 and from\nthe the 3-D reconstruction, 1020 km s\u22121 . The velocity over the entire event was\nwas found to be 478 km s\u22121 . The height was tracked from 1.9\u2013139.7 R\u2299 with an\nestimated error of 0.3 R\u2299 in HI1 and 0.6 R\u2299 in HI2. There were not enough data\npoints in the COR1/2 FOV to estimate the error. The morphologies from both\nperspectives are very similar. A nearly circular profile consisting of one faint\nloop-like structure which propagates all the way out into the COR 2 FOV (see\nFigure 4). In the HI1 FOV, there there appears to be a second loop-like feature\nbehind the main front which is expanding at a similar rate as the main front.\nThe CME is tracked until about half way across the HI2 FOV before it became\ntoo difficult to identify. The second loop-like structure could be associated with\na second flux rope or perhaps prominence material.\n4.3. Event 3: 9-10 April 2008\nThis event was first observed on 2008 9 April in both COR1 A and B at 10:05\nUT off the south west limb (see Figure 5). The last data point was observed\nat 15:29 UT on the 2008 April 10 in HI1 B. The CME was well observed in\nA and B images from both COR1 and COR2. The CME launch angle in the\nx-y plane was found to be \u221271\u25e6 , which corresponds to a front side event, while\nout of the ecliptic plane \u221260\u25e6 . Due to the large out of ecliptic angle the CME\ndoes not pass through the FOV of HI2 B. The velocity in the COR2 FOV as\n\nSOLA: maloney_20090331_pub.tex; 13 November 2018; 5:25; p. 13\n\n\fFigure 7.

There were not enough data points in the\nCOR1/2 to estimate the errors. The CME appears to be narrower in COR1 A\nthan in COR1 B. When the CME enters the COR2 FOV it appears the same\nsize in A and B (see Figure 5). The CME has a more elliptical shape in HI1\nand continues to propagate at a steep angle. There is no obvious trend of the\ntrajectory back towards the ecliptic plane which one may have expected (see\nFigure 9).\n4.4. Event 4: 9-13 April 2008\nThis event was first observed off the the east limb on the 9 April 2008 at 15:05\nUT by both COR1 A and B instrument (see Figure 6).

The CME was extremely\nfaint in both A and B COR1 but a small number of data points were able to\nbe recorded. The CME was reasonably clear in COR2 A but very faint in B.\nAs a result, the CME front was not visible and for this event a dark linear\nfeature was tracked instead (see Figure 6). The CME launch angle in the x-y\nplane was found to be \u221251\u25e6 which corresponds to a front side event, while out\nof the ecliptic plane 16\u25e6 (see Figure 10). The velocity in the COR2 FOV as\nviewed from A was found to be 110 km s\u22121 , from B, 218 km s\u22121 and from the\n3-D reconstruction, 189 km s\u22121 .

Discussion and Conclusions\nWe have reconstructed the 3-D trajectories of CMEs in the inner Heliosphere\nusing STEREO/SECCHI observations. These 3-D reconstructions give the true\npositions of the CMEs studied in the range between \u223c2\u2013240 R\u2299 as a function of\ntime. The COR1/2 data indicate that a radial propagation model is appropriate\nonce the CME is above a few solar radii. This is in agreement with what is\nexpected as the initial acceleration acting on a CME falls off steeply with increasing radius (especially the component which would act perpendicular to the\npropagation direction). We have also shown that the velocities derived from a\nsingle perspective can be at odds with values derived from a 3-D reconstruction.\n\nSOLA: maloney_20090331_pub.tex; 13 November 2018; 5:25; p. 16\n\n\fFigure 10. CME trajectory for the 9-13 April 2008 event. Top left: Cut in the x \u2212 y plane.\nTop right: Cut in the y-z plane. Bottom left: Cut in the x-z plane. Bottom right: 3-D trajectory.\nNote, the axes scales are not the same\n\nFinally, we have shown that CMEs undergo acceleration in the Heliosphere as\nthe velocities in the COR2 FOV can be very different to those in the HI FOV.\nThere are a number of outstanding issues with the reconstructions. Some of\nthese are the result of the reconstruction method, while others are related to the\ndata used or its interpretation. The stereoscopy method requires that we can\nidentify the same feature in both images and this is extremely difficult in some\ncases where the CME is very faint or has a very different appearance from each\nspacecraft. For example, the COR1 data for first event was so faint the CME\ncould not be identified in the A images (see Figure 3) and in both the third and\nfourth events, the identification of the same feature was extremely difficult as\nthe CME has a different appearance in each image (see Figures 5 and 6). This\nis evident in the reconstructions as they are less contiguous and there are large\nchanges in CME trajectories. These large changes are unphysical as there is no\nsource for such large forces acting in a direction transverse to the propagation\nin the Heliosphere.\n\nSOLA: maloney_20090331_pub.tex; 13 November 2018; 5:25; p. 17\n\n\fThe different sensitivities and light rejection levels of the each instrument\nmeans that CMEs may appear larger or smaller due to instrumental effects.\nThis leads to the discontinuities of the first event. Furthermore, as the front of\nthe CME is a line-of-sight integration through the CME (flux rope or magnetic\nbubble), it will appear different from each spacecraft. This is especially important in the HI FOV as CMEs can expand up to large sizes. This means that\nthe positions, and thus heights derived, will always be an upper limit on the\nactual values. If a model shape for CMEs is used, such as an ellipse or circle,\nwe can estimate the size of this effect. We await an event which is directed at\none of the in situ instruments and can be reconstructed as this would allow\nfor comparison of our reconstruction with the actual CME's path. Finally, the\ncoordinate transforms and geometry used in the reconstruction are not trivial\nand need to be taken into account (see the appendix for details).\nA number of interesting observations arise from these data. The difference in\nthe velocities of the CMEs in the COR and HI FOV, the possible multi-loop\nnature of two of the CMEs, the complex structure seen at the rear of the CMEs\n(especially in HI1) and finally the distortion of the CME front. In Table 1 we can\nsee that for the fast events (Events 2 and 3) the velocities in the COR FOV are\nhigher than the event average, and for slow events (Events 1 and 4) the opposite\nis true. This tendency for fast CMEs to be decelerated and slow CME to be\naccelerated could be caused by an interaction between the CME and the solar\nwind. In all cases, the velocity changes to approach a more typical solar wind\nvelocity. The mulit-loop nature is visible in Events 1 and 2 (see Figures 3 and 4).\nThese could be attributed to a second flux rope or possibly due to prominence\nmaterial. These features are only visible because of the unique features of the\nHI1 and HI2 instruments. Most of the events show complex structure at the rear\nof the CME. This is very apparent in Figures 3, 5 and 6. This type of structure\ncould be interpreted as the rear part of a flux rope if the flux rope axis was into\nor out of the image plane. Finally, the distortion of the CME front in Event 1 as\nit progresses through the Heliosphere could be caused by a number of processes.\nThis may be a Thomson scattering effect i.e., we are seeing different parts of\nthe CME from different regions along the lines of sight and it only appears as\nthough the CME front is distorted with the flanks ahead of the nose. The other\npossibility is that as the CME has expanded to an extremely large size at this\npoint, the nose and flanks are experiencing very different ambient solar wind\nconditions. As such, the CME flank may be in the high speed solar wind region\n(possibly accelerated by aerodynamic drag), or the nose may be in a relatively\ndensity enhanced region due to the heliospheric current sheet. This implies, it is\nexperiencing more drag than the CME flanks.\nThese reconstructions are the first steps towards the detailed study of CME\nkinematics in the Heliosphere. Using these trajectories, the full 3-D CME kinematics which will not be subject to projection effects can be derived. Combining\nthese with CME mass estimates will provide all the information needed to study\nthe forces acting on CMEs from \u223c2 R\u2299 to beyond 1 AU. This will allow a\ncomparison of the derived forces with those predicted by the various models\n(flux rope, snow plough and aerodynamic drag).\n\nSOLA: maloney_20090331_pub.tex; 13 November 2018; 5:25; p. 18\n\n\fAcknowledgements\n\nThis work is supported by a grant from Science Foundation Ireland's\n\nResearch Frontiers Programme.

Coordinate transforms in COR1 and COR2\nThe derivation of Helioprojective-Cartesian coordinates from pixel coordinates\nis a multi step procedure. In the first step, pixel coordinates are transformed\nto intermediate coordinates i.e., they are converted into the relevant units (meters, degrees, arcsec) but they are not adjusted for the reference point of the\nobservations or projection/geometrical effects. These intermediate coordinates\nare then transformed by the various possible projections (TAN, AZP, etc) and\nrotated into celestial coordinates. In the case of COR1/COR2, the small Sun\ncentred FOV means that the full spherical TAN or Gnomonic projection could\nbe approximated using the the small angle formula. The conversion from pixel\nto intermediate coordinates is given by\n\nxi = si\n\nN\nX\n\nmij (pj \u2212 rj )\n\n(5)\n\nj=1\n\nwhere pi refers to pixel coordinates, rj is the reference pixel, mij is a linear\ntransformation matrix and si is a scale function, with subscript i referring to\npixel axes and subscript j referring to coordinate axis (Calabretta and Greisen,\n2002). As a direct result of the small angle approximation we can readily convert\nto full Helioprojective-Cartesian by adding the reference co-ordinate ci to the\nintermediate co-ordinates as xi = xi + ci (where x0 and x1 correspond to \u03b8x and\n\u03b8y ).

This routine produces a list of 3-D coordinates\nin Stonyhurst Heliographic Coordinates which can be transformed into Heliocentric Earth Ecliptic (HEE), which is the coordinate system used for all our\nreconstructions (Thompson, 2006).\n\nSOLA: maloney_20090331_pub.tex; 13 November 2018; 5:25; p. 19\n\n\fB. Coordinate transforms in HI1 and HI2\nIn the HI FOV the derivation of Helioprojective-Cartesian coordinates from pixel\ncoordinates is more complex. The optical system of HI is described by the Slant\nZenithal (Azimuthal) Projection (AZP) model. The first step is to convert to\nintermediate coordinates as described above in Section A and by Equation 5.\nThe transformation between the intermediate coordinates and HelioprojectiveCartesian is much more complex as a full Slant (AZP) is required in which\n\u03c6 = tan\u22121 (x/ \u2212 y cos (\u03b3))\n(\n\n(8)\n\n\u03c8\u2212\u03c9\n\u03c8 + \u03c9 + 180\u25e6\n\n(9)\n\n\u03c8 = tan\u22121 (1/\u03c1)\n\n(10)\n\n\u03b8=\nwhere\n\n\u03c9 = sin\u22121\n\n\u03c1=\n\n180\u25e6\n\u03c0\n\nR=\n\n\u03c1\u03bc\np\n\u03c12 + 1\n\n!\n\nR\n(\u03bc + 1) + y sin (\u03b3)\n\nq\n2\nx2 + (y cos (\u03b3))\n\n(11)\n\n(12)\n\n(13)\n\nwhere \u03b3 is the look-angle or the angle between a line to the centre of the coordinate system and the centre of the camera optical axis and \u03bc is the distortion\nparameter. Once \u03c6 and \u03b8 are calculated they can then be rotated into celestial\ncoordinates to arrive at Helioprojective-Cartesian coordinates (\u03b8x and \u03b8y ).\n\nReferences\nAmari, T., Luciani, J.F., Aly, J.J., Tagger, M.: 1996, Astron.
