Thin disc stars are identified\nby means of Padova isochrones, and absolute magnitudes for the sample are evaluated\nvia the newly reduced Hipparcos data.

The usage of these calibrations can be extended to the estimation of\ngalactic model parameters for the thin disc individually, in order to compare these\nparameters with the corresponding ones estimated by \u03c72 min statistics (which provides\ngalactic model parameters for thin and thick discs, and halo simultaneously) to test\nany degeneracy between them. The calibrations can also be used in other astrophysical\nresearches where distance plays an important role in that study.\nKey words: Galaxy: disc, Galaxy: solar neighbourhood, stars: distances\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe distance of an astronomical object plays an important\nrole in deriving intrinsic luminosities of stars, in calculating accurate masses for binary system components and in\nanswering questions about galactic structure. Particularly,\nthe distributions of three populations (i.e. thin and thick\ndiscs, and halo) in the Galaxy can be determined using\nthe distances of the concerning stars. For nearby stars, the\nmost appropriate procedure for distance determination is\nthe trigonometric parallax. However, this procedure fails\nfor distant stars due to large errors in their trigonometric\nparallaxes. In this case, photometric parallax replaces the\ntrigonometric one. This alternative requires absolute magnitude determination which needs a lot of work, though not\nas much as the former one.\nThe photometric parallax can be evaluated in\ndifferent ways. Many astronomers prefer an absolute\nmagnitude-colour diagram for a star category. For example, Phleps et al. (2000) separated their star sample into two subsamples, disc and halo, according to\ntheir (r \u2212 i) colours and they used two absolute magnitude diagrams to evaluate their absolute magnitudes.\n\n\u22c6\n\nE-mail: sbilir@istanbul.edu.tr\n\nKaraali et al. (2003); Karaali, Bilir & Hamzao\u011flu (2004)\nand Bilir, Karaali & Gilmore (2006) separated their star\nsamples into three populations, i.e. thin and thick discs,\nand halo, and they used the absolute magnitude-colour diagrams of three globular clusters with the same metallicity of the corresponding population. Bilir, Karaali & Tun\u00e7el\n(2005) calibrated the Mg absolute magnitudes of late type\ndisc dwarfs with (g \u2212 r) and (r \u2212 i) colours in SDSS system.\nThe works of Siegel et al. (2002) and Juri\u0107 et al. (2008) are\nexamples for distance estimation based on photometric parallax. Another procedure for absolute magnitude determination is based on the use of colours and individual UV\u2013\nexcesses of stars relative to a standard absolute magnitudecolour diagram, such as Hyades (Laird, Carney & Latham\n1988; Karaali et al. 2003; Karaali, Bilir & Tun\u00e7el 2005). In\nthis procedure, one does not need to separate the stars\ninto different population types. Additionally, individual UV\u2013\nexcess for each star results in more precise absolute magnitudes relative to the procedure where a single colour magnitude diagram is used for all stars in a population.\nDespite the extensive applications of the aforementioned procedures in the previous paragraph, additional constraints can be considered for obtaining a more reliable one.\nWe applied three limitations, i.e. age, metallicity and surface\ngravity, to a star sample and calibrate the absolute mag-\n\n\f2\n\nBilir et al.\n\nnitude of thin disc stars as a function of two colours. All\nthese data were provided from Padova database of stellar\nevolutionary tracks and isochrones (Marigo et al. 2008) by\nusing a web interface1 . For the thin disc stars we adopted\na range of age of 0 6 t 6 10 Gyr, and the metal abundance is assumed to be 0.01 6 z 6 0.03 (solar metal abundance z\u2299 = 0.019), corresponding to the metallicity interval\n\u22120.30 6 [M/H] 6 0.20 dex. Finally, evolved stars were excluded from the sample by imposing a third constraint, i.e.\nsurface gravity log g > 4. Thus, we should supply a homogeneous thin disc main-sequence sample by eliminating all\nthick disc and halo stars, as well as evolved (white dwarfs,\nsub-giants and giants) thin disc stars.\n\n2\n\nDATA AND REDUCTIONS\n\nBVI photometric data and \u03c0 parallaxes with relative errors\n(\u03c3\u03c0 /\u03c0) 6 0.05 for 11644 stars were taken from the newly\nreduced Hipparcos data (van Leeuwen 2007), whereas the\n2MASS (Two Micron All Sky Survey) near-infrared photometric data for the same stars were extracted of the PointSource Catalogue and Atlas (Cutri et al. 2003). The 2MASS\nphotometric system comprises Johnson's J (1.25 \u03bcm) and H\n(1.65 \u03bcm) bands with the addition of Ks (2.17 \u03bcm) band,\nwhich is bluer than Johnson's K-band (Skrutskie et al.\n2006). The E(B \u2212 V ) colour-excesses were individually evaluated for each sample star making use of the maps of\nSchlegel, Finkbeiner & Davis (1998), and this was reduced\nto a value corresponding to the distance of the star by means\nof the equations of Bahcall & Soneira (1980). The E(B \u2212 V )\niso\u2013colour excess contours within 100 pc of solar neighbourhood are given in Fig. 1. The distribution of E(B \u2212 V ) for\nthe star sample for two distance intervals, 0 < d 6 40 pc and\n40 < d 6 70 pc, have a peak at E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.0041 and\nE(B \u2212V ) = 0.0098 mag which are rather close to the ones of\nHolmberg, Nordstr\u00f6m & Andersen (2007). Holmberg et al.\n(2007) evaluated the colour excesses, E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.0034\nand E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.0065 mag, for the same distance intervals\nby using Str\u00f6mgren photometry, respectively. The transformation of E(b \u2212 y) reddening to the E(B \u2212 V ) one is carried\nout by the equation E(B \u2212 V ) = 1.35 \u00d7 E(b \u2212 y). The excellent agreement between both sets of reddening data confirms\nthe reduction equations of Bahcall & Soneira (1980) and the\naccuracy of the colour-excesses used in our work.\nThus, colours and magnitudes from the sample stars are\nde-reddened by using the following two sets of equations,\none for the BVI data (Eq. 1) and one for the 2MASS (Eq.\n2) photometry:\nV0 = V \u2212 3.1 \u00d7 E(B \u2212 V ),\n(B \u2212 V )0 = (B \u2212 V ) \u2212 E(B \u2212 V ),\n\n(1)\n\n(V \u2212 I)0 = (V \u2212 I) \u2212 1.25 \u00d7 E(B \u2212 V ).\n\n(J \u2212 H)0 = (J \u2212 H) \u2212 0.322 \u00d7 E(B \u2212 V ),\n\n1\n\nhttp://stev.oapd.inaf.it/\u223c lgirardi/cgi-bin/cmd\n\nFigure 2. Distribution of the E(B \u2212V ) colour\u2013excess for the star\nsample for two distance intervals 0 < d 6 40 and 40 < d 6 70 pc.\nThe E(B \u2212 V ) colour-excesses corresponding to the these distributions are in good agreement with the ones of Holmberg et al.\n(2007).\n\n(see also, Bilir, G\u00fcver & Aslan 2006; Ak et al. 2007).\nThe absolute magnitude of each star is evaluated by\nthe combination of its de-reddened apparent magnitude and\nits distance estimated using its trigonometric parallax. The\ncorresponding propagated errors were calculated as \u03c3M =\n2.17(\u03c3\u03c0 /\u03c0) + \u03c3m, where (\u03c3\u03c0 /\u03c0) and \u03c3m are the relative\nparallax error and the error of the apparent magnitude in\nthe relevant photometric system, respectively.\n\n3\n\nJ0 = J \u2212 0.887 \u00d7 E(B \u2212 V ),\n(H \u2212 Ks )0 = (H \u2212 Ks ) \u2212 0.182 \u00d7 E(B \u2212 V ).\n\nFigure 1. The E(B \u2212V ) iso-colour-excess contours within 100 pc\nof the solar neighbourhood. Here, X and Y are heliocentric galactic coordinates oriented towards the galactic centre and galactic\nrotation, respectively.\n\n(2)\n\nTHE PROCEDURE AND ABSOLUTE\nMAGNITUDE CALIBRATION\n\nThe procedure consists of the calibration of the absolute\nmagnitudes for thin disc main-sequence stars with two\ncolours: one sensitive to early\u2013type (hot) and another sensitive to late\u2013type (cool) stars, providing a large range of\n\n\fAbsolute magnitude calibrations for the thin disc stars\n\n3\n\nabsolute magnitudes for the thin disc population. We calibrated MV absolute magnitudes with (B \u2212V )0 and (V \u2212I)0 ,\nfor the BVI photometry and MJ absolute magnitudes with\n(J \u2212 H)0 and (H \u2212 Ks )0 for the 2MASS data. As it was\nstated in Section 1, we limited the metallicity, the age, and\nthe surface gravity with the following constraints: \u22120.30 6\n[M/H] 6 0.20 dex, 0 6 t 6 10 Gyr, and log g > 4. By doing this we avoid any contamination due to thick disc and\nhalo stars, as well as from evolved thin disc stars. Hence,\nour calibrations should provide precise absolute magnitudes\nfor thin disc main\u2013sequence stars.\n3.1\n\nAbsolute magnitude calibration for BVI\nphotometry\n\nWe applied a series of limitations in the absolute magnitude\ncalibration for BVI photometry. First of all, we limited our\nstar sample with absolute magnitudes 0 < MV < 12. This\nlimitation reduced the original star sample from 11644 to\n10654. Then, we applied the procedure described in Section\n2 to the Padova isochrones with metallicity and age limitations mentioned above (Marigo et al. 2008) which separates the thin disc stars with different luminosity classes\n(dwarf and evolved stars) from the sample of 10654 stars.\nAt the third step, we applied the constraint for being a\nmain\u2013sequence star, i.e. log g > 4. Thus, the sample reduced\nto 6117 stars. Fig. 3 shows the colour\u2013absolute magnitude\ndiagram for the original sample (11644 stars) and the upper and lower envelopes of the final sample, i.e. thin disc\nmain-sequence stars. Then we adopted the MV calibration\nas follows and evaluated the coefficients by the least-squares\nmethod, for the final sample:\nMV = a1 (B \u2212 V )20 + b1 (V \u2212 I)20 + c1 (B \u2212 V )0 (V \u2212 I)0 (3)\n+d1 (B \u2212 V )0 + e1 (V \u2212 I)0 + f1 .\nThe numerical values of the coefficients and their errors, as well as the corresponding standard deviations and\nthe squared correlation coefficients are all given in Table 1.\nThe calibration described by Eq. 3 covers a large range of\nthin disc main-sequence stars, i.e. \u22120.15 < (B \u2212 V )0 < 1.60,\n\u22120.15 < (V \u2212 I)0 < 2.90, and 0 < MV < 12, that corresponds to the spectral types A0-M4.\n3.2\n\nAbsolute magnitude calibration for 2MASS\nphotometry\n\nThe procedure described in Section 2 and the limitations\napplied in Section 3.1 produced 4449 main\u2013sequence stars\nwith 2MASS photometric data, 93 per cent of the best quality following the survey criteria (labeled in the catalogue as\nAAA). Here, the star sample is limited with absolute magnitude 0 < MJ < 6. The MJ /(J \u2212 H)0 colour-magnitude\ndiagram for all stars taken from newly reduced Hipparcos\ncatalogue (11644 stars) and the upper and lower envelopes\nfor the final sample, i.e. thin disc main-sequence stars, are\ngiven in Fig. 4. We adopted an absolute magnitude calibration for the 2MASS data similar to the BVI ones as follows:\nMJ = a2 (J \u2212 H)20 + b2 (H \u2212 Ks )20 + c2 (J \u2212 H)0 (H \u2212 Ks )0 (4)\n+d2 (J \u2212 H)0 + e2 (H \u2212 Ks )0 + f2 .\n\nFigure 3. MV /(B \u2212 V )0 colour-absolute magnitude diagram for\nthe original sample. The upper and lower envelopes (the dashed\nlines) show the final sample, i.e. thin disc main\u2013sequence stars.\nThe thin curves correspond to Padova isochrones.\n\nThe numerical values of the coefficients and their errors, the\ncorresponding standard deviations, and the squared correlation coefficients are given in Table 1. The calibration given\nin Eq. 4 covers a large range of thin disc main-sequence\nstars, as the one in Eq. 3, i.e. \u22120.16 < (J \u2212 H)0 < 0.70,\n\u22120.07 < (H \u2212 Ks )0 < 0.26, and 0 < MJ < 6 corresponding\nto the spectral types A0-M0.\nWe plotted the errors of the observed colours against\nthe intrinsic colours in Fig. 5 in order to test the accuracy\nof the observed colours. The lower uncertainties belong to\n(B \u2212 V )0 and (V \u2212 I)0 colours, whereas those for (J \u2212 H)0\nand (H \u2212Ks )0 are larger. The mean observational errors are\nabout 0.01 (\u03c3 = \u00b10.02) and 0.04 (\u03c3 = \u00b10.04) mag in the\noptical and near-infrared colours, respectively. This is not\nsurprising, because 2MASS magnitudes were obtained from\nsingle-epoch observations, whereas optical magnitudes have\nbeen observed more than once. The mean errors introduce\ntypically \u00b10.12 and \u00b10.14 mag uncertainties in MV and MJ ,\nrespectively.\nUnfortunately, random errors, presumably symmetric\non the measured parallaxes, do not provide symmetric uncertainties on the computed distances. Therefore, a measured trigonometric parallax is very likely to be larger than\nthe true parallax. The problem has already been noticed and\nstudied by Lutz & Kelker (1973). Assuming a uniform space\ndistribution of stars and a Gaussian distribution of observed\nparallaxes about a true parallax, Lutz & Kelker (1973) revealed that there is a systematic error in the computed distances which depends only upon the ratio (\u03c3\u03c0 /\u03c0), where \u03c0 is\nthe observed parallax. Jerzykiewicz (2001) showed that only\nthe studies which are careful enough to use parallaxes with\n(\u03c3\u03c0 /\u03c0) < 0.1 could be excused as the bias would be negligible. This is the case in our work, where (\u03c3\u03c0 /\u03c0) 6 0.05.\nActually, the Lutz-Kelker correction in absolute magnitude,\ntaken from Lutz & Kelker (1973), is less than 0.03 mag.\nHence, we omitted the mentioned bias in our study.

The optical data are on the\nsame scale of UBVRI photometry. Hence, it was easy to evaluate the MVc absolute magnitudes, by placing (B \u2212 V )0 and\n(V \u2212I)0 colours into Eq. 3. However, the infrared colours and\nmagnitudes scale differently than the 2MASS data. Hence,\nwe used the normalized equations of Carpenter (2001) to\nreduce Pickles' (1998) infrared data to 2MASS colours and\n\nFigure 5. Colour errors for the BVI and 2MASS photometric\ndata.\n\nmagnitudes. Then, we evaluated the MJc absolute magnitudes by placing the reduced (J \u2212H)0 and (H \u2212Ks )0 colours\ninto Eq. 4. The original data of Pickles (1998) and the reduced ones according to normalized equations of Carpenter\n(2001) are given in Tables 2 and 3, respectively. Finally, we\nevaluated the MVP ic and MJP ic absolute magnitudes from\nthe data in Table 3 and we compared them with the MVc\nand MJc absolute magnitudes, respectively (Figs. 8 and 9).\nThere is a one\u2013to\u2013one correspondence in these figures as\nwell. The slight declination at the faint end of absolute magnitudes in Fig. 9 is probably due to the different scales between the Pickles' (1998) and 2MASS. We should add that\nthe mentioned comparison has been carried out only for stars\nof solar metallicity.\n\n4\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nWe present two equations (Eqs. 3 and 4) derived from newly\nreduced Hipparcos data (van Leeuwen 2007) with the aim\nof applying these formulae to relatively distant stars whose\ndistances are either newly reduced not accurately known or\n\n\fAbsolute magnitude calibrations for the thin disc stars\n\n5\n\nTable 2.

Thus,\nobtaining a continuous space density function from the Sun\nto large distances. This approach provides accurate galactic model parameters for the galactic components (thin and\nthick discs, and halo).\n\u2022 This procedure provides individually estimated galactic\nmodel parameters for the thin disc. Hence, one can compare\nthese parameters with the ones estimated by \u03c72 min statistics\nwhich provide galactic model parameters simultaneously for\nthin and thick discs, and halo; and we can test any possible\ndegeneracy between different galactic model parameters. We\nshould emphasize that the mentioned degeneracy is a serious\nproblem for the galactic model parameters. Thus, we hope\nto contribute a little to this problem which is suffered by the\ngalactic model researchers.\n\nFigure 8. Absolute magnitudes, estimated by Eq. 3, versus optical absolute magnitudes calculated from Pickles' data (upper\npanel) and variation of the differences between two sets of absolute magnitudes (lower panel).\n\nThe absolute magnitude calibrations for the thin disc\nmain-sequence stars with two colours, one sensitive to early\ntype (hot) and another sensitive to late type (cool) stars,\ncan also be used in other astrophysical researches, apart\nfrom the galactic model parameters estimation. Since absolute magnitude supplies the distance of a star, which plays\nan important role in the investigation of many properties of\nthat star.\nHowever, there are two significant issues which need to\nbe considered on this subject, i.e. binary stars and evolved\nstars.\n\n4.1\n\nFigure 9. Absolute magnitudes, estimated by Eq. 4, versus nearinfrared absolute magnitudes calculated from Pickles' data (upper panel) and variation of the differences between two sets of\nabsolute magnitudes (lower panel).\n\nnot known at all. To do this, one needs to obtain a sample of\nthin disc stars and replace the (B \u2212V )0 and (V \u2212I)0 colours\nwith Eq. 3 or (J \u2212 H)0 and (H \u2212 Ks )0 colours with Eq.\n4, depending on the preferred photometry. This procedure\ncan supply the following contributions to the estimation of\ngalactic model parameters:\n\nBinary stars\n\nA high fraction of stars are in fact binary systems and being a binary system makes stars appear brighter and redder\nthan they normally are. Different fractional values (defined\nas f ) can be found in the literature. For example, using the\ndata in the Gliese catalogue of nearby stars, Brosche (1964)\nfound a value of f = 0.4 for his simple model for the resolution criterion. On considering the local (within a distance of\n10 pc) binary fraction, Reid (1991) concluded that the proportion of binaries among \"stars\" is consistent with a value\nranging from 30 to 50 per cent. When all systems in question\nare binary stars, i.e. f = 1, Kroupa, Gilmore & Tout (1991)\nfound that a single mass function provides the best representation of a single luminosity function. However, a smaller\nvalue can not be discarded with high confidence. Halbwachs\n(1986) used all available data on binary systems and concluded that the proportion of single stars among all stellar\nsystems is at most 23 per cent when spectroscopic binaries\nare taken into account. An extensive long\u2013term radial velocity study of the Hyades cluster reveals that at least 30 per\ncent of the cluster stars are spectroscopic binaries and that\nessentially all stars brighter than the Hyades main\u2013sequence\nstars are in fact binary systems (Griffin et al. 1988).\nThe effect of binary stars were discussed in\nKroupa, Tout & Gilmore (1990, 1993, hereafter KTG90\nand KTG93, respectively) extensively as well as other\neffects such as metallicity, age, distance etc. KTG93 adopt\nthe binary fraction f \u223c 0.6 \u2212 0.7 as a reasonable value.\nThey give the mentioned combined effects as \"cosmic\n\n\fAbsolute magnitude calibrations for the thin disc stars\n\n7\n\nTable 4.

These authors estimate the scatter\nbelonging to binaries alone as \u03c3 = 0.27 mag, if a fraction\nf = 0.8 of all stars are unresolved binary systems. We\nadopted a simple but reasonable procedure, explained in\nthe following paragraphs, to reveal the binarism effect in\nour work and to compare with the ones appeared in the\nstudies cited above.\nWe separated the (B \u2212 V )0 and (J \u2212 H)0 colours into\nsmall bins and omitted a fraction of bright stars, each time,\nin these intervals. Then, we re\u2013calibrated the absolute magnitudes MV and MJ as a function of colours for the remaining stars. The fractions of binaries range from 0 to 80 per\ncent in steps of 10 per cent. Each time the locus of the stars\non the colour\u2013magnitude diagram moved to fainter absolute\nmagnitudes. The mean of the differences between the absolute magnitudes estimated by the calibration in Section 3\nand by these loci is adopted as the scatter due to the binaries\nin question (Table 4 and Fig. 10). Our procedure is based\non the fact that binarism make stars too bright and too red.\nWe calibrated the absolute magnitude scatter in f \u2013absolute\nmagnitude diagram, \u2206MV and \u2206MJ , linearly (Fig. 11) as\nfollows:\n\u2206MV = 0.411 \u00d7 f + 0.009,\n\n(5)\n\n\u2206MJ = 0.266 \u00d7 f + 0.014.\n\n(6)\n\nThe last two equations can be used to reduce the estimated absolute magnitudes by an amount of scatter corresponding to the adopted fraction of binary stars. The scatter\n\u03c3 = 0.35 mag in Table 4 is close to the one of KTG93, i.e.\n\u03c3 = 0.27 mag, for the fraction f = 0.8 of binary stars, confirming our simple but reasonable procedure used to reveal\nthe fraction of binary stars and the linear regressions in Eqs.\n(5) and (6).\n\n4.2\n\nEvolved stars\n\nA sample of field stars intrinsically brighter than an old star\u2013\nwith the same or similar spectral type\u2013passed its turn\u2013off is\nconsisted of evolved stars, and they will be brighter and redder than a younger sample. In our case, the contamination\nof the evolved stars seems to be at a minimum due to the\nrestrictions applied to the Padova isochrones in our work,\ni.e. the sample of the field stars are limited with metallicity\n\u22120.30 6 [M/H] 6 0.20 dex, age 0 6 t 6 10 Gyr, and surface gravity log g > 4. However, we applied the calibrations\n\nFigure 10. Lines indicating the fraction of binary stars in the\nMV /(B \u2212 V )0 colour\u2013magnitude diagram.\n\nFigure 11. Scatter in absolute magnitude versus fraction of binary stars. (a) \u2206MV \u00d7 f and (b) \u2206MJ \u00d7 f .\n\nin Eqs. (3) and (4) to the stars of young cluster Hyades and\ncompared the resulting absolute magnitudes with the ones\nestimated by the photometric parallaxes of the cluster stars.\nAfter a comprehensive study Perryman et al. (1998) stated\nthat the Hyades cluster has 282 member stars. However, to\nincrease the probability of the membership, we restricted the\nsample to 141 stars within 10 pc distance from the cluster\ncenter. It turned out that 81 of them were binary stars or\nvariable stars (Mason et al. 1993; Patience et al. 1998, SIMBAD data center). Hence, the 60 Hyades stars used in our\n\n\f8\n\nBilir et al.\n\nFigure 12. Absolute magnitudes, estimated via the calibrations\npresented in our work versus the ones evaluated by the parallaxes\nin the improved Hipparcos reduction. (a) MVc \u00d7 MVHip and (b)\nMJc \u00d7 MJHip .\n\nwork are single and non\u2013variable stars within 10 pc from the\ncenter of Hyades cluster.\nThe absolute magnitudes of the Hyades sample estimated by Eqs. (3) and (4) are plotted against the ones calculated from their trigonometric parallaxes, taken from the\nnewly reduced Hipparcos data (Fig. 12). There is an agreement between two sets of data, indicating that the field sample is not contaminated seriously by the evolved stars. The\nslight declination of the points towards the bright absolute\nmagnitudes is due to single epoch observations of the 2MASS\ndata (Fig. 12b).\nWe should add that both binarism and evolution effects make the star brighter and redder, which means they\nboth make the star move towards the same direction on the\ncolour\u2013magnitude diagram. Hence, the scatter in MV and\nMJ absolute magnitudes cited in Eqs. (5) and (6) can be\nassumed as the combined effect of binarism and evolution.\nIn this case, it is not surprising that the scatter \u03c3 = 0.35\nmag cited for the binary fraction f = 0.8 is a bit larger than\nthe one of KTG93, i.e. \u03c3 = 0.27 mag, which corresponds to\nthe binarism effect alone.\nWe wish to add that studying the effect of the evolved\nstars in the Hyades cluster revealed an unexpected issue\nfor the cluster. Using the newly reduced Hipparcos data we\nderived a new distance modulus for the cluster: 3.33 \u00b1 0.02\nmag. This value is slightly larger than the 3.30 \u00b1 0.04 mag\nof Perryman et al. (1998).\n\n5\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe would like to thank the anonymous referee for his suggestion towards improving the manuscript.
