The implicit in this success\nis the use of a rather early thermalization time that is quite often well below\n1 fm 1 [3,4]. The early starting time of hydrodynamics, that is identified with\nthe thermalization time, is justified in a natural way if the quark-gluon plasma\nis a strongly interacting system [5,6].\nOn the other hand, there are attempts to describe the RHIC data with the\nhelp of models which do not assume very fast thermalization. The success\nof such models in reproducing the data may indicate that the quark-gluon\nplasma is not necessarily a strongly interacting system. An example of such\na model has been introduced in Ref. [7], where the authors assume that the\nperfect-fluid stage is preceded by free streaming of partons, see also [8,9,10].\nAnother example is a model discussed in Ref. [11], where the initial stage\nconsists of partons with thermalized transverse degrees of freedom only [12].\nRecently, we have formulated a framework of highly-anisotropic and stronglydissipative hydrodynamics (ADHYDRO) [13,14,15]. This model interpolates\nbetween a highly-anisotropic initial state (where the longitudinal and transverse pressures may be substantially different from each other) and the regime\ndescribed by the perfect-fluid hydrodynamics. It may be used to analyze the\neffects of early anisotropic pressure on the subsequent evolution of matter.\nADHYDRO may be treated as an important generalization of the models introduced in Refs. [7,11] because the change from the early highly-anisotropic\nsystem to the subsequent locally isotropic stage is described as a continuous\nprocess. We note that in [7,11] a similar change was described with the help\nof the Landau matching conditions which demand that the energy flux in the\ntransition is conserved but do not demand the continuity of all components\nof the energy-momentum tensor.\nOur formulation of the model in [13,14] has been followed by the papers by\nMartinez and Strickland [16,17], where a similar approach has been derived\nfrom the kinetic theory with the collision term treated in the relaxation time\napproximation. In the case of purely longitudinal expansion one may show that\nthe approaches introduced in [13,14] and [16,17] lead to the same structure\nof equations that determine the evolution of pressure asymmetry and entropy\ndensity. The only difference may be found in the form of the entropy source.\nInterestingly, if the pressure asymmetry is small, both approaches are strictly\nequivalent and they agree with the second-order Israel-Stewart theory. In Ref.\n[15] we have shown additionally, that the entropy source terms used in [13,14]\nand [16,17] lead to practically the same results even if the initial pressure\nasymmetry is very large.\n\n1\n\nWe use the natural system of units where c = kB = h\u0304 = 1.\n\n2\n\n\fIn this paper, besides the boost-invariant longitudinal motion, the transverse\nexpansion is also taken into account. In such a general case, the explicit connections between ADHYDRO, the underlying kinetic theory, and the IsraelStewart theory have not been established yet. However, in the initial stage\nwhere the effects of pressure asymmetry are most significant, the longitudinal\nmotion dominates the dynamics of the system, and we deal with a situation\nthat is quite similar to that described in Refs. [13,16]. On the other hand, at\nthe stage where the transverse flow becomes substantial, the pressure asymmetries are eliminated and the system's expansion is well described by the\nperfect-fluid hydrodynamics. Therefore, we consider ADHYDRO as a good\ncandidate for the model which extrapolates well between an initial highlyanisotropic state and a later perfect-fluid phase 2 .\nIn this paper we use ADHYDRO and show that as long as the initial energy\ndensity profile is unchanged the calculated observables remain practically the\nsame. This result indicates the insensitivity of the analyzed observables to the\ninitial anisotropy and suggests that the complete thermalization of the system\nmay be delayed to easily acceptable times of about 1 fm. In this way we find\nfurther support to ideas presented in [7,11].\nThe fact that different initial pictures lead to the same results for hadronic observables means that the freeze-out conditions for different physical scenarios\nare similar. This suggests the formation of universal flow in heavy-ion collisions, as pointed out first in Refs. [18,19]. On the other hand, different initial\nconditions may affect other observables, that have not been studied here. In\nparticular, the early pressure anisotropy may have an important impact on the\ndirected flow, as shown recently in [20]. The study of this problem requires,\nhowever, a generalization of the ADHYDRO code to 3+1 dimensions, which\nis a work in progress.\n\n2\n\nDefinition of the model\n\nThe ADHYDRO model is based on the following form of the energy-momentum\ntensor [13],\nT \u03bc\u03bd = (\u03b5 + P\u22a5 ) U \u03bc U \u03bd \u2212 P\u22a5 g \u03bc\u03bd \u2212 (P\u22a5 \u2212 Pk )V \u03bc V \u03bd .\n2\n\n(1)\n\nA natural connection between ADHYDRO and dissipative hydrodynamics may\nbe achieved if the model is constructed explicitly in such a way that it interpolates\nbetween an initial highly-anisotropic state and a later dissipative stage described\nby the Israel-Stewart theory. This work is in progress.\n\n3\n\n\fHere \u03b5, P\u22a5 , and Pk are the energy density, transverse pressure, and longitudinal pressure, respectively. In the case where the two pressures are equal,\nP\u22a5 = Pk = P , we recover the energy-momentum tensor of the perfect fluid.\nThe four-vector U \u03bc in (1) is the hydrodynamic flow,\nU \u03bc = \u03b3(1, vx , vy , vz ),\n\n\u03b3 = (1 \u2212 v 2 )\u22121/2 ,\n\n(2)\n\nand V \u03bc defines the longitudinal (beam) direction,\nV \u03bc = \u03b3z (vz , 0, 0, 1),\n\n\u03b3z = (1 \u2212 vz2 )\u22121/2 .\n\n(3)\n\nThe four-vectors U \u03bc and V \u03bc satisfy the following normalization conditions:\nU 2 = 1,\n\nV 2 = \u22121,\n\nU * V = 0.\n\n(4)\n\nIn the local-rest-frame (LRF) of the fluid element we have U \u03bc = (1, 0, 0, 0)\nand V \u03bc = (0, 0, 0, 1), and the energy-momentum tensor is reduced to a simple\nform,\n\uf8eb\n\u03bc\u03bd\nTLRF\n=\n\n\uf8ec\u03b5\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n0\nP\u22a5\n\n\uf8f6\n\n0 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n0 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\n\uf8f7.\n\uf8f7\n\n(5)\n\n0 P\u22a5 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\n0 0\n\n0 Pk\n\n\uf8f8\n\nThus, the formula (1) allows for different pressures in the longitudinal and\ntransverse directions.\nBesides the energy-momentum tensor (1), we introduce the entropy flux\n\u03c3 \u03bc = \u03c3U \u03bc ,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u03c3 is the entropy density. We assume that \u03b5 and \u03c3 are functions of P\u22a5 and\nPk . For massless partons the condition T \u03bc\u03bc = 0 gives \u03b5 = 2P\u22a5 + Pk , however,\nin our actual calculations we use more involved expressions introduced below\nin Sect. 4\nThe space-time evolution of the system is governed by the equations expressing\nthe energy-momentum conservation and the entropy growth,\n\u2202\u03bc T \u03bc\u03bd = 0,\n\u2202\u03bc \u03c3 \u03bc = \u03a3.\n\n(7)\n(8)\n4\n\n\fThe function \u03a3 represents the entropy source. The form of \u03a3 must be treated as\nan assumption that defines the dynamics of the anisotropic fluid. It is natural\nto assume that \u03a3 \u2265 0, with \u03a3 = 0 for P\u22a5 = Pk . In this way, in the case where\nthe two pressures are equal, the structure of the perfect-fluid hydrodynamics\nis recovered.\nTreating \u03a3 as a function of P\u22a5 and Pk , Eqs. (7) and (8) become a closed\nsystem of 5 equations for 5 unknown functions: three components of the fluid\nvelocity, P\u22a5 , and Pk . The projections of Eq. (7) on U\u03bd and V\u03bd yield\nD\u03b5 = \u2212(\u03b5 + P\u22a5 )\u2206 + (P\u22a5 \u2212 Pk )U\u03bd V \u03bc \u2202\u03bc V \u03bd ,\nV \u03bc \u2202\u03bc Pk = (\u03b5 + P\u22a5 )V\u03bd DU \u03bd + (P\u22a5 \u2212 Pk )\u2202\u03bc V \u03bc ,\n\n(9)\n(10)\n\nwhere we have introduced the operators D \u2261 U \u03bc \u2202\u03bc and \u2206 \u2261 \u2202\u03bc U \u03bc .\n\n3\n\nImplementation of boost-invariance\n\nIn this paper we consider boost-invariant systems which expand arbitrarily in\nthe transverse plane. Therefore, we introduce the following parameterizations\nof the four-vectors U \u03bc and V \u03bc ,\nU \u03bc = (u0 cosh \u03b7, ux , uy , u0 sinh \u03b7),\n\n(11)\n\nV \u03bc = (sinh \u03b7, 0, 0, cosh \u03b7),\n\n(12)\n\nwhere u0 , ux , and uy are components of the flow in the plane z = 0, satisfying\nthe normalization condition\nu20 \u2212 u2x \u2212 u2y = 1,\n\n(13)\n\nand \u03b7 is the space-time rapidity\n\n\u03b7=\n\n1 t+z\nln\n.\n2 t\u2212z\n\n(14)\n\nEquations (11) and (12) satisfy automatically the normalization conditions\n(4). In the boost-invariant case the derivative D and the divergence \u2206 have\nthe form\n5\n\n\fD = U \u03bc \u2202\u03bc = u0 \u2202\u03c4 + u\u22a5 * \u2207\u22a5 ,\nu0\n\u2206 = \u2202\u03bc U \u03bc = \u2202\u03c4 u0 +\n+ \u2207\u22a5 * u\u22a5 ,\n\u03c4\n\n(15)\n(16)\n\nwhere u\u22a5 = (ux , uy ), \u2207\u22a5 = (\u2202x , \u2202y ), and \u03c4 is the longitudinal proper time\n\u03c4=\n\n\u221a\n\nt2 \u2212 z 2 .\n\n(17)\n\nMoreover, for the boost-invariant flow we find\n\nV \u03bc \u2202\u03bc =\n\n\u2202\u03b7\n,\n\u03c4\n\n\u2202\u03bc V \u03bc = 0.\n\n(18)\n\nEquations (18) may be used to check that Eq. (10) is automatically fulfilled\nfor a boost-invariant system. Thus, from the energy-momentum conservation\nwe obtain only three independent equations, the formula (9) which we repeat\nhere for completeness\n\nD\u03b5 = \u2212(\u03b5 + P\u22a5 )\u2206 + (P\u22a5 \u2212 Pk )U\u03bd V \u03bc \u2202\u03bc V \u03bd ,\n\n(19)\n\nand two equations describing transverse dynamics. The latter can be chosen as\nthe linear combinations: U1 \u2202\u03bc T \u03bc1 + U2 \u2202\u03bc T \u03bc2 = 0 and U2 \u2202\u03bc T \u03bc1 \u2212 U1 \u2202\u03bc T \u03bc2 = 0,\nwhich leads us to the two expressions\n\n\"\n\n#\n\nu\u22a5 * \u2207\u22a5 P\u22a5\nu0\nu\u22a5\n+ DP\u22a5 + (P\u22a5 \u2212 Pk ) ,\nDu\u22a5 = \u2212\n2\n\u03b5 + P\u22a5\nu\u22a5\n\u03c4\n!\nux\n1\nD\n= 2\n(ux \u2202y \u2212 uy \u2202x ) P\u22a5 .\nuy\nuy (\u03b5 + P\u22a5 )\n\n(20)\n(21)\n\nTogether with the entropy production equation, see Eq.

In the similar way, our framework requires that all thermodynamics-like\nquantities can be expressed as functions of two arbitrarily chosen parameters.\nSuch relations play a role of the generalized equation of state and allow us to\nclose the system of dynamic equations formulated in the previous sections.\nIn our previous studies [13,21] we have shown that it is better to switch from\nP\u22a5 and Pk to two other thermodynamics-like parameters: the non-equilibrium\nentropy density \u03c3 and the anisotropy parameter x. In particular, if we deal\nwith partons described by the anisotropic phase-space distribution function\nobtained by squeezing/stretching\u221a the longitudinal momentum in the Boltzmann distribution by the factor x, we obtain\n\u03c02\u03c3\n\u03b5=\n4g0\n\n!4/3\n\n(23)\n\n!4/3 \"\n\nR(x)\n+ xR\u2032 (x) ,\n3\n\n(24)\n\n!4/3 \"\n\n#\n\n(25)\n\n\u03c02\u03c3\nP\u22a5 =\n4g0\n\n\u03c02\u03c3\nPk =\n4g0\n\nR(x),\n\n#\n\nR(x)\n\u2212 2xR\u2032 (x) .\n3\n\nThe function R(x) is defined by the formula [21]\n#\n\u221a\n1 \"\nx arctan x \u2212 1\n3 g0 x\u2212 3\n\u221a\n,\n1+\nR(x) =\n2\u03c0 2\nx\u22121\n\n(26)\n\nand g0 is the degeneracy factor connected with internal quantum numbers of\npartons. The symbol R\u2032 (x) denotes the derivative of R(x) with respect to x,\nfor x = 1 we have R\u2032 (1) = 0 and the two pressures are equal.\nWe stress that Eqs. (23)\u2013(25) describe the non-equilibrium state defined by the\nvalues of the non-equilibrium entropy density \u03c3 and the anisotropy parameter\n7\n\n\fx. However, since in the equilibrium we have: \u03b5id = 3g0 T 4 /\u03c0 2 , Pid = g0 T 4 /\u03c0 2 ,\nand \u03c3id = 4g0 T 3 /\u03c0 2 [1], Eqs. (23)\u2013(25) may be written equivalently in the\nform 3 ,\n\u03b5 = \u03b5id (\u03c3)r(x),\n\n(27)\n\nP\u22a5 = Pid (\u03c3) [r(x) + 3xr \u2032 (x)] ,\n\n(28)\n\nPk = Pid (\u03c3) [r(x) \u2212 6xr \u2032 (x)] ,\n\n(29)\n\nwhere \u03b5id (\u03c3) and Pid (\u03c3) are equilibrium expressions for the energy density\nand pressure, and r(x) = \u03c0 2 R(x)/(3g0 ). One can easily notice that for x = 1\nwe have r(1) = 1 and r \u2032 (1) = 0, hence Eqs. (27)\u2013(29) are reduced to the\nequilibrium expressions.\nAs stated above, the structure of Eqs. (23)\u2013(25) and Eqs. (27)\u2013(29) follows\nfrom the special form of the momentum distribution. This form is very much\nlikely to be realized at the very early stages of the collisions. On the other\nhand, at later stages of the collisions, the produced matter approaches local\nequilibrium described by the appropriate equation of state. In other words, as\nthe system becomes more isotropic, i.e., as the parameter x tends to unity,\nthe local properties of the fluid become closer to those characterized by the\nrealistic equation of state. This argument convinced us to use, in the numerical\ncalculations presented below, the following expressions\n\u03b5 = \u03b5qgp (\u03c3)r(x),\n\n(30)\n\nP\u22a5 = Pqgp (\u03c3) [r(x) + 3xr \u2032 (x)] ,\n\n(31)\n\nPk = Pqgp (\u03c3) [r(x) \u2212 6xr \u2032 (x)] ,\n\n(32)\n\nwhere \u03b5qgp (\u03c3) and Pqgp (\u03c3) characterize the realistic equation of state for vanishing baryon chemical potential, as it has been constructed in Ref. [22], and\nthe function r(x) is the same as that appearing in Eqs. (27)\u2013(29).\nIt is necessary to admit that Eqs. (30)\u2013(32) have no direct microscopic explanation. The main motivation for this form is that it has two attractive limits.\nAt the very early stage the system consists most likely of massless partons\nand Eqs. (30)\u2013(32) approach Eqs. (27)\u2013(29), since the realistic equation of\n3\n\nFor simplicity, Eqs. (23)\u2013(25) have been introduced for the squeezed/stretched\nclassical (Boltzmann) distribution. A generalization to the squeezed/stretched quantum (Bose-Einstein or Fermi-Dirac) distributions has been given recently in [15].\nThis generalization introduces an irrelevant factor.\n\n8\n\n\fstate approaches the Stefan-Boltzmann limit (although deviations from this\nlimit are noticeable). On the other hand, when the system becomes isotropic,\nx = 1 and Eqs. (30)\u2013(32) are reduced to the equation of state used in standard\nhydrodynamics.\n\n5\n\nEntropy source\n\nIn this paper, following our original formulation of the model in Ref. [13], we\nuse the following form of the entropy source\n\u221a\n(1 \u2212 x)2 \u03c3\n\u221a\n\u03a3=\n.\n(33)\nx\n\u03c4eq\nThe quantity \u03c4eq is a timescale parameter. The form (33) guarantees that\n\u03a3 \u2265 0 and \u03a3(\u03c3, x = 1) = 0. More arguments for such a particular form\nof \u03a3 are given in [13]. They connect x with the ratio of the transverse and\nlongitudinal temperatures.\nIn the case of purely longitudinal expansion and for small deviations from\nequilibrium one can show that Eq. (33) leads to quadratic dependence of the\nentropy source on the variable \u03be = 1 \u2212 x and this dependence is compatible with the Israel-Stewart theory (where the entropy production depends on\nthe viscous stress squared) and with the Martinez-Strickland model [16]. For\nmore general situations, the equation (33) should be treated as one of the\nassumptions defining our model. Other forms of the entropy source have been\nanalyzed in [15]. All those forms lead to similar numerical results.\nWe emphasize that the structure of the entropy source is an external input\nfor the anisotropic hydrodynamics. Especially, in the region where the asymmetries are large and no correspondence to dissipative hydrodynamics can be\nfound. In this context, it is interesting to obtain any hints about \u03a3 for large\nx from the microscopic models of particle production or from the AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence.\nIn our numerical calculations we adopt the value \u03c4eq = 0.25 fm. This choice is\nsuggested by our previous calculations [13,14,15], where we have shown that\nit leads to almost complete thermalization of matter at the proper time of\nabout 1 fm (for highly anisotropic initial conditions studied here). Our earlier\ncalculations have shown that reaching the perfect-fluid regime at \u03c4 \u223c 1 fm is\nnecessary to obtain a good agreement with the data 4 .\n4\n\nIf the free-streaming or transverse-hydrodynamics stage is longer than 1 fm, it is\ndifficult to achieve a good description of data, as discussed in Refs. [7,11].\n\n9\n\n\fcoll\nThe value \u03c4eq = 0.25 fm corresponds to \u03c4eq\n= (2/15)\u03c4eq \u2248 0.03 fm used in the\ncoll\ncollision term by Martinez and Strickland [15,16]. Such a small value of \u03c4eq\nindicates that the plasma is indeed a strongly interacting system. However, our\nexample shows that the average collision time in a highly-anisotropic plasma\nand the plasma isotropization time may be quite different.\n\n6\n\nAnisotropy evolution\n\nIf both the generalized equation of state and the entropy production term\nare defined, one can derive a compact expression for the time evolution of\nthe anisotropy parameter x. Of course, this expression should be considered\ntogether with other dynamic equations. Nevertheless, its form turns out to be\nuseful in the analysis of the time evolution of the system.\nIn the case described by Eqs. (30)\u2013(32), we find\n\n3xPqgp\nDx =\n\u03b5qgp\n\n\u0012\n\n3u0\nPqgp\n\u2212\u2206 \u2212 1+\n\u03c4\n\u03b5qgp\n\u0013\n\n!\n\nH(x)\n,\n\u03c4eq\n\n(34)\n\nwhere\n\u221a\nr(x) (1 \u2212 x)2\n\u221a\nH(x) = \u2032\n.\nr (x)\nx\n\n(35)\n\nIf 3Pqgp = \u03b5qgp , which is the case realized by Eqs.

(37) in Sect. 8.1.\n10\n\n\f7\n\nInitial conditions\n\nThe initial conditions for the evolution are defined by four functions: \u03c3(\u03c40 , x\u22a5 ),\nx(\u03c40 , x\u22a5 ), ux (\u03c40 , x\u22a5 ), and uy (\u03c40 , x\u22a5 ), where \u03c40 is the initial proper time. In the\nnumerical calculations we assume \u03c40 = 0.25 fm. We also assume that there\nis no transverse flow present initially, therefore we set ux (\u03c40 , x\u22a5 ) = 0 and\nuy (\u03c40 , x\u22a5 ) = 0.\nFor the initial anisotropy x(\u03c40 , x\u22a5 ), which we take as independent of x\u22a5 and\ndenote simply as x0 , we consider three different options: x0 = 100, x0 = 1,\nand x0 = 0.032. The case x0 = 1 is, of course, the closest to that described by\nstandard perfect-fluid hydrodynamics.\nThe case x0 = 100 corresponds to the initial situation where the transverse\npressure is much larger than the longitudinal pressure. In this case the momentum shape is oblate; the momentum distribution is stretched in the transverse\ndirection and squeezed in the longitudinal direction to the beam. This type\nof the initial conditions is considered in the Color Glass Condensate (CGC)\napproach where the distribution functions in the longitudinal direction are\ndescribed by the Dirac delta function, \u03b4(pk ) at z = 0 [23,24], see also Ref. [25].\nThe values x0 < 1 correspond to the prolate momentum shape. This type of\nthe initial conditions have been analyzed, for example, in Refs. [26,27].\nThe value x0 = 0.032 has been chosen, since r(100) \u2248 r(0.032), and for fixed\nenergy density the entropy densities in the cases x0 = 100 and x0 = 0.032 are\nthe same. Therefore, the case x0 = 0.032 may be considered as a counterpart\nof the case x0 = 100 with inversed role of pressures.\nIn all considered cases we assume that the initial energy density in the transverse plane, \u03b50 (\u03c40 , x\u22a5 ), is proportional to the normalized density of sources\n\u03c1\u0303(b, x\u22a5 ), where b is the impact parameter corresponding to a given centrality\nclass,\n\u03b50 (\u03c40 , x\u22a5 ) = \u03b5i \u03c1\u0303(b, x\u22a5 ).\n\n(38)\n\nThe parameter \u03b5i is the initial energy density at the center of matter in most\ncentral collisions. Its value may be estimated from the standard hydrodynamic calculations [1]. We use the value \u03b5i = 86.76 GeV/fm3 . If the considered matter was in equilibrium, its temperature would be equal to 485 MeV.\nThe normalized density of sources \u03c1\u0303(b, x\u22a5 ), is constructed as a combination\nof the wounded-nucleon density \u03c1W (b, x\u22a5 ) and the density of binary collisions\n\u03c1B (b, x\u22a5 ) [28],\n\u03c1(b, x\u22a5 ) =\n\n1\u2212\u03b1\n\u03c1W (b, x\u22a5 ) + \u03b1\u03c1B (b, x\u22a5 ) ,\n2\n11\n\n(39)\n\n\f\u03c1\u0303(b, x\u22a5 ) =\n\n\u03c1(b, x\u22a5 )\n.\n\u03c1(0, 0)\n\n(40)\n\nThe distributions \u03c1W (b, x\u22a5 ) and \u03c1B (b, x\u22a5 ) are calculated for a given centrality\nclass from the Glauber model in the optical approximation. Following the\nPHOBOS studies of the centrality dependence of the hadron production [29]\nwe take \u03b1 = 0.14. In the limit \u03b1 \u2192 0 our assumption (39) is reduced to the\nwounded nucleon model [30].\nBy fixing both the initial energy density and the initial anisotropy parameter,\nwe determine the initial entropy density profile from Eq. (30), namely\n\u03c3(\u03c40 , x\u22a5 ) =\n\n\u03b5\u22121\ngqp\n\n\"\n\n#\n\n\u03b5i \u03c1\u0303(b, x\u22a5 )\n.\nr(x0 )\n\n(41)\n\nHere \u03b5\u22121\ngqp (\u03b5) is the inverse function to \u03b5gqp (\u03c3). The b-dependence displayed\non the right-hand-side of Eq. (41) induces centrality dependence of the initial\nentropy density profiles.\n\n8\n\nResults\n\n8.1 Central collisions\nLet us first discuss our results obtained for the centrality class c = 0 \u2212 5%,\nwhich corresponds to the impact parameter b = 2.26 fm. In our all calculations\nwe use the value \u03b5i = 86.76 GeV/fm3 . This implies that the initial entropy density at the center equals \u03c3i = \u03c3(\u03c40 , x\u22a5 = 0) = 227.6 fm\u22123 for the case x0 = 1,\nand \u03c3i = 151.7 fm\u22123 for the cases x0 = 100 and x0 = 0.032. The same initial\nenergy density, \u03b5i = 86.76 GeV/fm3 , is assumed in the perfect-fluid calculation\nbased on the LHYQUID code [31,32], which serves as a reference point. Since\nthe perfect-fluid case is obtained formally by setting x \u2261 0 in ADHYDRO, the\ninitial entropy density in the perfect-fluid calculation equals \u03c3i = 151.7 fm\u22123\nand the initial temperature is Ti = 485 MeV.\nFigure 1 shows the time dependence of the entropy density at the center of the\nsystem, i.e., the function \u03c3(\u03c4, x\u22a5 = 0), in the time interval 0.25 fm \u2264 \u03c4 \u2264 2 fm,\nfor three different initial values of the anisotropy parameter: x0 = 100 (dasheddotted line), x0 = 1 (dotted line), and x0 = 0.032 (dashed line). The entropy\ndensity increases significantly at the initial stage of collisions in the two cases\nexhibiting strong initial asymmetry, i.e., for x0 = 100 and x0 = 0.032. After\nreaching the maximum at \u03c4 = 0.3 fm, \u03c3(\u03c4, x\u22a5 = 0) starts to decrease.

The results\nhave been obtained for the centrality class c = 0 \u2212 5%. The corresponding result of\nthe perfect-fluid hydrodynamics is denoted by the solid line.\n\n\u03c4 > 0.5 fm, the entropy density scales approximately as 1/\u03c4 . This behavior\nreflects the approximate perfect-fluid behavior reached for significantly large\ntimes 5 . In the case x0 = 1, the entropy density decreases in the very much\nsimilar way as in the perfect-fluid case denoted by the solid line. Interestingly, in all considered cases the final entropy densities are very much similar.\nThis result suggests that the final particle multiplicities may be practically\nthe same.\nThe behavior of the entropy density may be discussed from a complementary\npoint of view if we analyze the function \u03a3(\u03c4, x\u22a5 = 0). The time dependence of\nthe entropy source is shown in Fig. 2. The notation is the same as in Fig. 1. In\nthe case x0 = 100 (dashed-dotted line) the initial entropy production is large.\nAt later times \u03a3(\u03c4, x\u22a5 = 0) becomes smaller, since the pressure asymmetry\ndecreases; see Fig. 3 where the corresponding time dependence of x(\u03c4, x\u22a5 = 0)\nhas been shown. In the case x0 = 0.032 (dashed line) the initial entropy\nproduction is also large but it drops to zero at the time when x passes unity.\nLater it increases and becomes similar to that found for the case x0 = 100. If\nthe initial asymmetry is 1 (dotted line), the entropy production is generally\nsmall because x stays close to unity during the whole evolution.\nWe stress that the results obtained with ADHYDRO where x has been initially\nset equal to zero are slightly different from the results obtained within perfectfluid hydrodynamics. The origin of this difference may be traced back to the\n5\n\nThe scaling \u03c3 \u221d 1/\u03c4 is strictly valid for the longitudinal, boost-invariant expansion.

In the 1+1\nboost-invariant case with Eqs. (27)\u2013(29), which is easy to analyze explicitly\n[13], the time dependence of x is determined by the equation (37).\nThe first term on the right-hand-side of (37) describes the effects of free streaming, while the second term is responsible for thermalization/isotropization. For\nsmall initial values of x, the first term dominates the very early dynamics and\nx starts to grow with time. However, as the evolution time increases, the first\nterm becomes negligible, the second term takes over and determines an approach to equilibrium. For large initial values of x the second term dominates\n14\n\n\fthe dynamics of matter from the very beginning. If we assume x = 1 at the\nbeginning of the evolution, the second term vanishes, since H(1) = 0, and x\nincreases. This effect is important only if \u03c4 is small, which agrees with the idea\nthat the free streaming of partons may be relevant only at the beginning of\nthe evolution of matter, when the system is very much dense and the effects\nconnected with asymptotic freedom may play a role.\nHaving solved numerically the ADHYDRO equations for given initial conditions we determine the freeze-out hypersurfaces. We follow the same procedure as in standard 2+1 hydrodynamics. The only difference is that we\nexclude times smaller than 1 fm, where the system is substantially anisotropic\nand consists of gluons rather than hadrons that can be freely emitted. For\n\u03c4 > 1 fm, the matter is practically in local equilibrium and we may specify\nthe freeze-out condition by fixing the freeze-out temperature Tf . In our calculations we assume Tf = 150 MeV, the value which turned out be successful in\nthe description of the RHIC data in our earlier approaches. If the freeze-out\nhypersurface is determined, we use it as an input in THERMINATOR 2 [34,35] to\ngenerate physical events.\nSince the analysis of hadronic abundances indicates that the baryon number\n\u221a\ndensity is not exactly zero at midrapidity in Au+Au collisions at sNN = 200\nGeV, we include small non-zero values of the chemical potentials [36].\nIn Fig. 4 we show the transverse-momentum spectra of pions (upper part),\nkaons (middle part), and protons (lower part). We use the same notation as\nin the previous Figures: x0 = 100 (dashed-dotted line), x0 = 1 (dotted line),\nx0 = 0.032 (dashed line), LHYQUID (solid line). One can see that all versions\nof the calculations yield very similar results for the spectra. A small persistent\ndifference can be noticed - the results with x0 = 100 are the highest, while\nthose with x0 = 0.032 are the lowest. In particular, the spectra obtained with\nx0 = 100 agree better with the data in the high p\u22a5 region. Nevertheless,\nthe results obtained with different values of x0 are close to each other and\nto the standard 2+1 hydrodynamic result obtained with LHYQUID. This\nmeans that the strong early anisotropic behavior have small impact on the\nobservables. This, in turn, leads us to the conclusion that the data does not\nexclude a possibility that such an anisotropic stage can exist for about 1 fm at\nthe beginning of the collision. It is also preferable, that the initial transverse\npressure is larger than the longitudinal pressure.\nFigure 5 shows the HBT radii calculated with FEMTO THERMINATOR,\na part of the THERMINATOR 2 package [35].

With the\nvalue \u03b5i = 86.76 GeV/fm3 used in Eq. (41), the b-dependence of the source\ndensity implies the following values of the central initial entropy density:\n\u03c3i = 183.1 fm\u22123 for the case x0 = 1, and \u03c3i = 120.3 fm\u22123 for the cases x0 = 100\nand x0 = 0.032 if c = 20 \u2212 30%; \u03c3i = 171.3 fm\u22123 for the case x0 = 1, and\n\u03c3i = 113.8 fm\u22123 for the cases x0 = 100 and x0 = 0.032 if c = 20 \u2212 40%.\nIn Fig. 6 we show our model results for the transverse-momentum spectra of\npions (upper part), kaons (middle part), and protons (lower part), obtained\nfor the centrality class c = 20 \u2212 30% and compared with the RHIC data.\n17\n\n\f1000\n\nd 2 N\u0090Hdy 2\u03a0 pT dpT L @GeV-2 D\n\n\u03a0+\n100\n10\n1\n0.1\n0.01\n0.001\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\npT @GeVD\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n100\n\nd 2 N\u0090Hdy 2\u03a0 pT dpT L @GeV-2 D\n\nK+\n\nPHENIX Au+Au \u009e\nc = 20 - 30 %\n\n10\n\n1\n\nSNN = 200 GeV\nLHYQUID\nx0=1\nx0=100\nx0=0.03\n\n0.1\n\n0.01\n\n0.001\n0.0\n\n\u00b6i = 86.76 GeV \u0090 fm3\nTf = 150 MeV\n\u03a40 = 0.25 fm\n\u03a4eq = 0.25 fm\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\npT @GeVD\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n1.5\npT @GeVD\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n10\n\nd 2 N\u0090Hdy 2\u03a0 pT dpT L @GeV-2 D\n\np\n1\n\n0.1\n\n0.01\n\n0.001\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\nFig. 6.

In any case, for p\u22a5 \u2264 2 GeV, where the hydrodynamics\nmodel is expected to work, the agreement with the data is very good.\nFigure 7 shows the HBT radii for the centrality class c = 20 \u2212 30%.

The results obtained with different initial\nvalues of the anisotropy parameter coincide with each other. They are also\nconsistent with the LHYQUID result. For p\u22a5 \u2264 2 GeV the model results agree\nwith the data. For larger values of transverse-momentum, the perfect-fluid\nhydrodynamics overshoots the experimental data, which is a known effect.\n19\n\n\f0.25\nSTAR\n0.20\n\nv2\n\n0.15\n\n0.10\n\nAu+Au \u009e SNN = 200 GeV\nc = 20 - 40 %\n\n\u03a0+ +K +\n\n\u00b6i = 86.76 GeV \u0090 fm3\nTf = 150 MeV\n\u03a40 = 0.25 fm\n\u03a4eq = 0.25 fm\n\nLHYQUID\nx0 =1\nx0 =100\nx0 =0.03\n\n0.05\n\n0.00\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\npT @GeVD\n\n\u221a\nFig. 8.

We have found that the initial conditions with different\nanisotropies lead to similar results, provided the initial energy density profile\nin the transverse plane is the same. This result agrees well with earlier findings where the perfect-fluid stage starting at about 1 fm was preceded by free\nstreaming of partons or by expansion of matter thermalized only in the transverse direction. The main conclusion from those studies is that the complete\nthermalization of matter may take part at the times of about 1 fm. In order to\nreproduce the elliptic flow of pions, it is not necessary to assume that matter\nthermalizes within a fraction of one fermi, as the decrease of spatial eccentricity of the reaction zone is compensated by the building of the transverse\nflow in an early non-equilibrium stage (described as free streaming, transverse\nhydrodynamics, or highly-anisotropic and strongly-dissipative hydrodynamics\nused in this paper).\n\n10\n\nAppendix: Integral form of the conservation laws\n\nThe conservation laws (7) and (8) can be integrated over the spatial transverse\ncoordinates. This leads to the global conservation laws. In the case of Eq. (8)\n20\n\n\fwe obtain\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03c4\n\nZ\n\nh\n\ni\n\nd2 x\u22a5 \u03c3(\u03c4, x\u22a5 )u0 (\u03c4, x\u22a5 )\u03c4 = \u03c4\n\nZ\n\nd2 x\u22a5 \u03a3(\u03c4, x\u22a5 ).\n\n(42)\n\nIf the entropy source term \u03a3(\u03c4, x\u22a5 ) vanishes, the left-hand-side of Eq. (42) is\nzero. This implies that the entropy per unit rapidity is conserved. In the case\nof Eq. (8) we define the quantity \u03b5\u22a5 ,\n\u03b5\u22a5 (\u03c4, x\u22a5 ) = \u03b5(\u03c4, x\u22a5 )u20 (\u03c4, x\u22a5 ) + P\u22a5 (\u03c4, x\u22a5 )u2\u22a5 (\u03c4, x\u22a5 ).\n\n(43)\n\nThe integration of (7) yields\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03c4\n\nZ\n\nd2 x\u22a5 [\u03b5\u22a5 (\u03c4, x\u22a5 )\u03c4 ] = \u2212\n\nZ\n\nd2 x\u22a5 Pk (\u03c4, x\u22a5 ).\n\n(44)\n\nIf the longitudinal pressure Pk (\u03c4, x\u22a5 ) vanishes, no work is done in the longitudinal direction, and Eq. (44) leads to the conservation of the energy per unit\nrapidity. Equations (42) and (44) are useful for checking the numerical code.\nWe have found that in our calculations they are satisfied with the accuracy of\nabout 0.001%.\n\nReferences\n[1] W.
