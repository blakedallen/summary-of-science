Rates\nof failure and withdrawal from these courses are often high and substantial research into\nthis subject has shown that students' misconceptions in physics persist after instruction.4,5\nThis paper describes an attempt to evaluate, using a multiple-choice concept inventory,6 a\nreformed introductory mechanics curriculum7 which aims to mitigate these issues by altering\nthe goals and content (i.e., the curriculum) of the typical mechanics course.\nTo help improve student learning in physics, many new methods of content delivery\n(pedagogy) have been developed in recent years. Typically, these methods have been implemented with little change to course curricula. Well established pedagogical modifications\nnow used widely include tutorials,8 clicker questions,9 peer instruction,10 Socratic tutorial\nhomework systems,11 multiple representations of concepts and principles,12 and reconfigurations of the instructional environment.13 There is ample evidence that students who\nexperience these pedagogical reforms perform better on end-of-course concept inventories\nthan students in passive lecture courses. Concept inventories are useful tools to make such\ncomparisons in these cases where all courses (with and without pedagogical reform) share,\nfor the most part, the same core content and goals.\nBy contrast, there is sparse research on how student learning is affected by substantial alterations to the goals and content (curriculum) of introductory physics courses. One reason\nfor the lack of such work is the relative absence of alternative introductory physics curricula; improvements to the introductory physics curriculum have not progressed as rapidly as\nimprovements in pedagogy. Most students learn introductory physics following a canon of\ntopics that has remained largely unchanged for decades regardless of the textbook edition\nor authors. Moreover, choosing how to compare a novel introductory physics curriculum to\na traditional curriculum presents a challenge. Concept inventories can be used for such a\ncomparison.14 However, there are a number of issues that are peculiar to curricular compar2\n\n\fison including which topics to select for comparison and the alignment of the inventory with\nthe goals and content of the curricularly reformed course.\nAt the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech, GT), we have used a concept\ninventory to evaluate student understanding of force and motion in both a traditionally sequenced introductory calculus-based mechanics course15 and an introductory calculus-based\nmechanics course using the reform curriculum, Matter & Interactions (M&I).7 While both\ncourses employ similar pedagogical best practices, M&I differs from the traditional curriculum in its focus on the generality of fundamental physical principles, the introduction of\nmicroscopic models of matter, and its coherence in linking different domains of physics.16,17\nIn particular, M&I revises the learning progression of the first semester introductory mechanics course by reorganizing and augmenting the traditional sequence of topics. For example,\nearly emphasis is placed on the impulse-momentum theorem (referred to as the \"momentum\nprinciple\" in the M&I curriculum), \u2206~p = F~ \u2206t, with iterative application of the momentum\nprinciple over short time steps to predict motion by means of both analytic calculation and\nnumerical computation.18,19 Furthermore, M&I introduces non-constant forces early on to\ndemonstrate the predictive power of this principle. By contrast, in a traditional curriculum, early emphasis is placed on study of the kinematics of special case situations (e.g.,\nmotion under constant acceleration) without explicit discussion of dynamics. Further discussion of differences between the M&I curriculum and a traditional curriculum can be found\nelsewhere.7,16\u201318\nAt present, there is no mechanics concept inventory whose force and motion content has\nbeen explicitly aligned with goals and content in both courses both traditional and M&I\nmechanics reform. (By contrast, there is at least one concept inventory that is aligned with\nboth traditional and M&I electromagnetism.14,20 ) Under these circumstances, we chose the\nForce Concept Inventory (FCI) to make a comparative evaluation both because it is widely\nused and because of anecdotal evidence of underperformance on the FCI in courses using\nM&I mechanics at other institutions. The FCI was designed to probe performance on force\nand motion in a particular way; within the context of specific situations, FCI questions were\ndesigned to draw out common misconceptions and naive notions about force and motion.6\nAs a result, a measurement of performance using the FCI does not provide a comprehensive\npicture of student understanding of force and motion; the nuances of interpreting student\nperformance on the FCI have been well-documented.21\u201325 Furthermore, the FCI was not\n3\n\n\fspecifically developed to compare student performance between courses, but has been used\nfor this purpose.26 Thus, to emphasize the idea the FCI probes force and motion in a\nrestricted way, we indicate, in this paper, the content of and concepts covered by the FCI\nas FCI force and motion concepts.27 Moreover, we qualify all of our comparative measures\nwith the understanding that the FCI was designed in the context of a traditional sequenced\ncurriculum before the M&I curriculum came into existence.\nThe description of our study is presented below as follows: In Sec. II, we describe the\norganizational structure of the Georgia Tech mechanics courses. Sec. III summarizes the\nresults of the in-class testing. In Sec. IV, we present an analysis of FCI performance by\nindividual item and concept. Sec. V examines possible reasons for performance differences\nobserved in Secs. III and IV. In Sec. VI, we provide more insight into the performance\ndifferences, make concluding remarks, and outline possible future research directions.\n\nII.\n\nINTRODUCTORY MECHANICS AT GEORGIA TECH\n\nTABLE I: Georgia Tech FCI test results are shown for twentytwo traditional sections (T1-T22) and six Matter & Interactions sections (M1-M6).

Attendance of\nlecture sections is optional but encouraged through a small incentive (2-5% of course grade).\nAttendance of laboratory and recitation sections is mandatory. In the traditional (TRAD)\ncurriculum, each student attends a two-hour laboratory and, in a separate room, a one-hour\nrecitation each week.28 In the M&I curriculum, students meets once per week with teaching\nassistants for a single three-hour laboratory/recitation session involving both lab activities\n(for approximately 2 hours on average) and separate recitation activities (for approximately\n1 hour on average). Room/TA scheduling is responsible for the differences in instructional\nlocations between the two courses. The student population of the mechanics course (both\ntraditional and M&I) consists of approximately 85% engineering majors and 15% science\n(including computer science) majors.\nTable I summarizes the FCI test results for individual sections. In most traditional (T6T22) and all M&I sections, NO students in each section took the FCI during the last week\n6\n\n\fof class at the completion of the course. In all of the traditional sections and in the majority\nof M&I sections (M2-M6), NI students in each section took the FCI at the beginning of\nthe course during the first week of class. For a given section, NI is approximately equal to\nthe number of students enrolled in that section. NO is usually smaller than NI , sometimes\nsubstantially so (e.g., T12, T13 and T20). M&I students took both the pre- and post-test\nduring their required laboratory section. Students of the traditional curriculum typically\ntook the pre-test during the first lecture or lab section. Traditional students were asked to\nattend an optional section during their evening testing period to take the post-test. Students\nbecome busy with other coursework near the end of the semester, hence fewer traditional\nstudents attended this optional evening section. In each section, only those Nm students\nwho took the FCI both on entering and on completion of the course are considered for the\npurposes of computing any type of gain (Sec. III). The FCI was administered using the\nsame time limit (30 minutes) for both traditional and M&I students. M&I students were\ngiven no incentives for taking the FCI; they were asked to take the exam seriously and told\nthat the score on the FCI would not affect their grade in the course. Traditional students\ntaking the FCI were given bonus credit worth up to a maximum of 0.5% of their final course\nscore, depending in part on their performance on the FCI. This incentive difference between\nthe two curricula has no bearing on the performance differences we observe in our data (Sec.\nV).\n\nIII.\n\nSUMMARY OF MEASUREMENTS FROM IN-CLASS TESTING\n\nThe FCI pre-test scores for Matter & Interactions (M&I) and traditional students did\nnot differ significantly (mean FCI score, 48.9% for TRAD vs. 47.4% for M&I). By contrast,\non the FCI post-test, traditional students significantly outperformed M&I students (mean\nFCI score, 71.3% for TRAD vs. 59.3% for M&I). In Fig. 1, these mean scores have been\nreported with 95% confidence intervals estimated from the t-statistic for each distribution.29\nA common measure of the change in performance from pre-test to post-test26 is the average\npercentage gain, G = (O \u2212I) \u2217 100%, where I is the average fractional FCI score for students\nentering a mechanics course, and O is the average end-of-course fractional FCI score. We\nalso report an average normalized gain g, where g = (O \u2212 I)/(1 \u2212 I), and where (1 \u2212 I)\nrepresents the maximum possible fractional gain that could be obtained by a class of students\n7\n\n\fTRAD\n\nN=1983\n\nPOST\nM&I\n\nN=733\nError bounds\n(\n)\n\nTRAD\n\nare 95%\nConfidence\nIntervals\n(\u00b1 2 \u03c3)\n\nN=4344\n\nPRE\nM&I N=763\n0\n\n50\nAverage FCI Score (%)\n\n100\n\nFIG. 1. Average pre- and post-instruction FCI scores at Georgia Tech. The average FCI preand post-test scores are shown for students who took a one-semester mechanics course with either\nthe traditional (TRAD) or Matter & Interactions (M&I) curriculum. The number of students (N )\ntested for each curriculum is indicated in the figure. The error bounds represent the 95% confidence\nintervals (estimated from the t-statistic) on the estimate of the average score.\n\nwith an average incoming fractional FCI score of I. For the gains reported in Fig. 2, 95%\nconfidence intervals have been estimated from the t-statistic for the distributions of G and\ng. The data are shown for Nm students (Table I).\nFCI pre-test score distributions were found to be statistically indistinguishable between\nthe two curricula, which is evident from Fig. 3(a). By contrast, distributions of post-test FCI\nscores were dissimilar; the traditional distribution was shifted towards higher scores (Fig.\n3(b)). This is consistent with the finding that the mean score achieved by traditional students\nwere higher than their M&I peers on the post-test (Fig. 1). Because the distributions of FCI\npre- and post-test scores were non-normal, the similarity of the distributions was compared\n8\n\n\fTRAD\n\n(a)\n\nN=1935\n\nM&I N=662\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\nG (%)\nTRAD\n\n(b)\n\nN=1935\n\nM&I N=662\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\ng\nFIG. 2. Gain in understanding of mechanics as measured by the FCI. The increase in student\nunderstanding resulting from a one-semester traditional (TRAD) or Matter & Interactions (M&I)\ncourse is measured using (a) the average raw gain G and (b) the average normalized gain g. Only\nstudents with matched scores were used for this figure (see Table I). The error bounds represent\nthe 95% confidence intervals (estimated from the t-statistic) on the estimate of (a) the raw gain\nand (b) the normalized gain.\n\nusing a rank-sum test.30,31\nAn examination of measures of student performance entering each course suggests that\nthe incoming and outgoing student populations of both curricula were identical. We obtained\nand examined students' grade point averages (GPA) upon entering the mechanics course,\nSAT Reasoning Test (SAT) scores, and the grades earned in the mechanics course; we found\nno significant difference in the distributions of any of these metrics using a rank-sum test.\nMean scores differed between one or more sections within a given curriculum as measured\nby a Kruskal-Wallis test.31 Given this section effect, we compared the three lowest performing\n9\n\n\f15\n(a) PRE\n\n%10\n5\n0\n\nTRAD\n\nM&I\n0\n\n25\n\n50\n\n75\n\n100\n\n50\nFCI % Score\n\n75\n\n100\n\n15\n(b) POST\n\n%10\n5\n0\n\n0\n\n25\n\nFIG. 3. FCI score distributions by curriculum. The distribution of FCI test scores for students\nbefore (a) and after (b) completing a mechanics course with either a traditional (dashed line) or\nM&I curriculum (solid line) are shown. The total number of students tested in each curriculum\nis the same as in Fig. 1. The plots are constructed from binned data with bin widths equal to\napproximately 6.7% of the maximum possible FCI score (100%).\n\ntraditional sections (T7, T8, & T16) to the three highest performing M&I sections (M2, M4,\n& M5) to determine if this section effect enhanced the overall observed differences in the\nnormalized gains. Post-test FCI scores were statistically indistinguishable between these\nsubsets. However, traditional students in these sections had significantly lower pre-test FCI\nscores. Hence, students in these lower performing traditional sections achieved significantly\nhigher normalized gains. We also compared the FCI post-test scores achieved by the three\ntraditional sections with lowest normalized gains (T14, T18, & T22) to the M&I sections\nwith the highest normalized gains (M3, M4, & M5). Pre-test FCI scores were significantly\nhigher for the M&I subset while post-test scores were higher for the traditional subset. Thus\n10\n\n\fnormalized gains achieved by traditional students in this subset were higher.\n\nIV.\n\nITEM ANALYSIS OF FCI MEASUREMENTS\n\nStudent performance on individual questions or groups of questions was used to determine\non which FCI force and motion concepts students in the traditional curriculum outperformed\nM&I students. Questions on the FCI were sorted into concept categories using Hestenes'\noriginal conceptual dimensions,6 but we required that each question be placed in only one\ncategory. In our work only five concept categories were used: Kinematics, Newton's 1st\nLaw, Newton's 2nd Law, Newton's 3rd Law, and Force Identification. The first four of these\ncategories were identical to Hestenes' dimensions and Force Identification was a renamed\ncategory which contained questions from Hestenes' Kinds of Forces dimension. In Fig. 4 the\nitems that comprise each category are listed. Note that this was an a priori categorization\nbased on our judgment of the concepts covered by the items; it is not the result of internal\ncorrelations or factor analysis based on student data.\nWe used the normalized gain in performance on a per question basis to quantify item\nperformance. We define an item gain,\ngi =\n\nfpost,i \u2212 fpre,i\n1 \u2212 fpre,i\n\n(1)\n\nwhere fpre,i and fpost,i are the fraction of students responding correctly to the ith item on\nthe pre- and post-test respectively. This measure normalizes the gain in performance on\na single item by the largest possible gain given the students' pre-test performance on that\nitem; gi is essentially the Hake gain for a single item. To discern which questions have large\nitem gains, we can compare gi for each question to the mean item gain,\nN\n1 X\n\u1e21 =\ngi\nN i\n\n(2)\n\nwhere N is the number of items on the FCI.\nTo illustrate the differences between curricula succinctly, we computed difference in normalized item gains between the two curricula. We define the difference in normalized item\ngain,\n\u2206gi = giT \u2212 giM\n11\n\n(3)\n\n\f1.0\n0.5\n\n0.0\n0.5\n\n1\n2\n14\n19\n20\n6\n7\n8\n10\n12\n21\n23\n3\n9\n22\n24\n25\n26\n27\n4\n15\n16\n28\n5\n11\n13\n17\n18\n29\n30\n\n\u0001 gi\n\nKinematics\n\nForce\n2nd Law 3rd Law Identification\n\n1st Law\n\nFIG. 4. Difference in performance for individual FCI items and mechanics concepts. The difference\nin performance \u2206gi between traditional and M&I students is shown for each question on the FCI.\nPositive (negative) \u2206gi indicates superior performance by traditional (M&I) students on individual\nquestions. The numerical labels indicate the corresponding question number in order of appearance\non the FCI. The items are grouped together into one of five concepts: Kinematics, Newton's first\nlaw, Newton's second law, Newton's third law, and Force Identification. The horizontal line (dash)\nillustrates the value of \u2206g the mean difference in the item gains between curricula.\n\nwhere giT and giM are the normalized gain for the ith item achieved by traditional and\nM&I students respectively. We discovered on which questions students' item gains in each\ncurricula differed the most by comparing \u2206gi for each item to the mean difference in the\nitem gains between curricula,\n\u2206g =\n\nN\n1 X\n\u2206gi .\nN i\n\n(4)\n\nThe plot of \u2206gi illustrates better performance by traditional students across all concepts\non the FCI (Fig. 4). We observed that \u2206gi is positive for almost all questions, and 45%\nof the questions had values of \u2206gi greater than \u2206g = 0.238. The grouping of the FCI\n12\n\n\fTABLE II. The average difference in item gains between curricula are computed for the items in\neach FCI force and motion concept, \u2206gc . Each \u2206gc is positive, indicating better average item\ngains for traditional students across all FCI force and motion concepts. Concepts with higher\n\u2206gc are those for which traditional students achieve higher normalized gains than M&I students.\nTraditional students achieve the highest values of \u2206gc on the Kinematics and Force Identification\nconcepts and lowest on Newton's 1st Law concept.

For example, the difference in performance on the Force\nIdentification concept was striking, where 5 of the 7 questions in this category had \u2206gi > \u2206g.\nMoreover, this grouping helps one to determine on which concepts differences in item\ngains were greatest. We computed the difference in the average concept gain,\n\u2206gc =\n\n1 X\n\u2206gi\nNc i\u01ebc\n\n(5)\n\nwhere Nc is the number of items covering concept c. Concepts with higher \u2206gc were those\non which traditional students achieved higher normalized gains than M&I students. The\nKinematics and Force Identification concepts had the highest values of \u2206gc (shown in Table\nII). By contrast, we found \u2206gc for Newton's 1st Law which was well below \u2206g. The remaining\ntwo concepts had values of \u2206gc slightly below \u2206g.\n\nV.\n\nCONTRIBUTIONS TO THE PERFORMANCE DIFFERENCES\n\nWe turn now to the examination of factors that might contribute to higher FCI posttest scores by traditional students, including grade incentives, differences in pedagogy, and\ndifferences in instruction (e.g., homework and lecture topics).\n13\n\n\fThe incentive given to traditional students to take the FCI was too small to account\nfor the marked differences in performance indicated in Figs. 1, 2, and 3(b). As mentioned\nearlier (Sec. II), traditional students were provided with an incentive to take the FCI while\nM&I students received no incentive. In principle, sufficiently large incentives can impact\nFCI outcomes. For example, Ding, et al. found a 10-15% increase in FCI post-test scores if\nscores on the FCI were valued as highly as course exams.32 To check for this incentive effect,\nwe offered similar incentives (i.e., a maximum of 0.5% bonus to overall course grade) to both\ntraditional and M&I students who took the FCI post-test at Georgia Tech in the fall of 2009.\nDuring this term, we found the performance differences for M&I and traditional students\nwere similar to those reported in this paper. FCI data from fall 2009 was not included in\nthis paper because instructional changes had been made to the M&I course; M&I sections\nM1-M5 had similar homework exercises, lectures, and laboratories.\nThe performance differences cannot be attributed to differences in pedagogy. It is wellknown that using interactive engagement (i.e., \"clicker\" questions, ConceptTests, Peer Instruction, etc.) can improve students' conceptual understanding in introductory and advanced courses.26,33,34 However, all sections (both traditional and M&I) were largely indistinguishable with respect to interactive engagement: all sections used similar methods\n(\"clicker\" questions) with similar intensity (3-6 \"clicker\" questions per lecture period).\nWe examined whether differences in coursework (homework) could be connected to performance differences on the FCI. We categorized the 575 traditional homework questions\nand the 756 M&I homework questions. Questions were placed into one or more categories\ndepending on the topical nature of the problem and the principles needed to answer the\nquestion. Categories included the five FCI force and motion concepts discussed in Sec. IV\nas well as several other concepts which do not appear on the FCI (e.g., Angular Momentum). The Kinematics category included questions about the relationships between position,\nvelocity, and acceleration that did not refer to the underlying dynamical interactions that\ncause changes in these quantities. Questions in the Newton's 1st Law category included\nqualitative questions which discussed the direction of motion and its relationship to applied\nforces. The Newton's 2nd Law category included questions with a heavy emphasis on contact forces and resolving unknown forces, but excluded open-ended questions in which the\nprediction of future motion is the goal (e.g., using iterative methods to predict the motion\nof an object). Questions in the Newton's 3rd Law category included questions in which New14\n\n\fTABLE III. An estimate of the fraction of homework questions covering a particular FCI concept\nin the two mechanics curricula is compared. Subtopics for these homework questions were not\nmutually exclusive. The relative fraction of homework questions covering FCI force and motion\nconcepts and some individual FCI concepts (i.e., Kinematics, Newton's 2nd Law, Newton's 3rd\nLaw, and Force Identification) is greater in the traditional curriculum.\nEst.

Generally, it was\napplied to contact forces and gravitational interactions. The Force Identification category\nincluded questions in which the direction and relative strength of forces acting on a body\nor set of bodies were represented by diagrams (i.e., force-body diagram). The aforementioned categories represent those concepts that are covered extensively in the first half of a\ntraditional physics course and were heavily represented on the FCI.\nThe difference in the relative fraction of homework questions covering FCI force and\nmotion concepts between the curricula (Table III) reflect the overall performance differences\nobserved in Figs. 1 - 3. Furthermore, the differences in the relative fractions of homework\nquestions corresponding to individual FCI concepts were consistent with the results from\nour item analysis (Fig. 4). The relative fraction of homework questions was computed by\nfirst categorizing questions, then counting the number of questions covering the concepts of\ninterest and dividing by the total number of homework questions given in a curriculum. The\nrelative fraction of homework questions covering FCI force and motion concepts differed by\nmore than a factor of 2 in favor of the traditional curriculum. On individual FCI concepts, we\nfound a lower relative fraction of homework questions in the M&I curriculum compared to the\n15\n\n\ftraditional curriculum on four of the five concepts: Kinematics, Newton's 2nd Law, Newton's\n3rd Law, and Force Identification. On most FCI questions about these concepts traditional\nstudents outperformed M&I students (Sec. IV & Fig. 4). We found that the relative fraction\nof Newton's 1st Law questions were similar. This signature was also observed in our item\nanalysis (Fig. 4); the Newton's 1st Law FCI concept had the smallest \u2206gc (Sec.IV).\nThe difference in the relative fraction of force and motion lectures/readings between the\ncurricula (Table IV) was consistent with the overall performance differences observed in\nFigs. 1, 2, & 3(b). The relative fraction of lectures/readings which cover FCI force and\nmotion concepts was greater by nearly a factor of 2 for the traditional curriculum. This\nresult is consistent with the difference in the relative fraction of homework questions (Table\nIII). However, the differences in the relative fractions of lectures/readings corresponding to\nindividual FCI concepts showed mixed results when compared to our item analysis (Fig. 4).\nThe relative fractions for three of five concepts were greater for the traditional curriculum:\nKinematics, Newton's 3rd Law, and Force Identification. But on two concepts, the relative\nfractions of lectures/readings were roughly similar: Newton's 1st Law and Newton's 2nd\nLaw. Lecture and reading topics were examined and categorized for each curriculum using\nthe same categories as our homework question analysis.\n\nVI.\n\nCLOSING REMARKS AND LESSONS LEARNED\n\nWe have found that students who completed an introductory mechanics course which\nemploys the Matter & Interactions curriculum earned lower post-test FCI scores than students who took a traditionally sequenced curriculum. The differences in performance were\nsignificant and were supported by the number of students involved in the measurement. We\ndemonstrated that these differences cannot be explained by differences in the incoming or\noutgoing population of students between the courses (i.e., SAT scores, GPA, etc.). The\noverall performance differences between the curricula on the post-test were consistent with\nthe amount of instruction within each curriculum. The relative fraction of FCI force and\nmotion concepts that appeared on students' homework and in their lectures was roughly\ntwice as large for the traditional curriculum (Tables III & IV). We observed this signature\nin the differences of the means and distributions of FCI scores (Fig. 1, 2, & 3(b)) as well\nas the average item gain (Eqn. 2). The average item gain for traditional students was\n16\n\n\fTABLE IV. An estimate of the fraction of lecture/reading topics in the two mechanics curricula is\ncompared. Subtopics for these lectures/readings were not mutually exclusive. The relative fraction\nof lectures/readings in the traditional course is greater for the Kinematics, Newton's 3rd Law, and\nForce Identification topics which is consistent with their superior performance in those concepts\non the FCI. However, on Newton's 1st and 2nd Laws, the relative fraction of lectures/readings are\nroughly similar.\nEst.

IV). Furthermore, we found\nthat traditional students outperformed M&I students across all subtopics on the FCI (Fig.\n4) and that these differences were consistent with the amount of instruction on individual\nFCI force and motion concepts that appeared on students' homework (Table III).\nThese results indicate the challanges that arise when concept inventories are used to\nmake comparative evaluations of curricular course reforms; such challenges, it should be\nemphasized, do not typically arise when concept inventories are used to evaluate pedagogical\nreforms, which often do not affect core course content. There are at least two considerations that must be kept explictly in mind for the case of curricular reform. First, sensible\ncomparison between courses with and without reform can be made only on content that is\npresent both in courses. Comparing student performance on curricular materials exclusive\nto one or the other course (e.g., computation in the case of M&I mechanics) makes little\nsense. Substantial content on force and motion is found in both traditional and M&I curricula; however, as was mentioned in Sec. I, the specifics of force and motion content differ\nsubstantially between the two curricula. Second, the composition of the evaluation instrument itself represents a particular selection of content and goals. Ideally, for a comparative\n17\n\n\fevaluation, the content in the instrument should be aligned with content present in both\ncourses (with and without reform) under study; moreover, the goals evaluated by the instrument should be clearly connected to the learning goals of both courses. Our results support\nthe idea that the content of the FCI is more closely aligned with the content of traditional\ncourses than with M&I mechanics content, thereby posing significant barriers to interpreting the meaning of FCI performance differences between traditional and M&I courses. We\nemphasize that these difficulties were not present in earlier work by some of us that used a\nconcept inventory (the Brief Electricity and Magnetism Assessment (BEMA)) to evaluate\ncomparatively traditional and M&I curricula for introductory electromagnetism.14 In the\nearlier work, comparisons were made based on similar electromagnetism content present (in\napproximately equal measure) in both courses; moreover, the instrument used was carefully\nconstructed to align with the minimal subset of content and goals in all courses.20\nNotwithstanding its use to evaluate comparatively different curricula, data from the FCI\nmight be used to adjust the content and goals of a given curriculum. For example, if faced\nwith FCI performance similar to that reported here, M&I mechanics course instructors may\nmake the (reasonable) decision that students should have more practice with qualitative\nquestions on topics covered by FCI. In recent terms, we have made small modifications to\nthe M&I curriculum by adding some homework problems and lab activities that are more\naligned with the scope of the FCI. As a consequence we have observed small improvements to\nthe FCI scores of M&I students. We have not made a systematic study of which modifications\nto the M&I curriculum are most effective for improving student performance on the FCI.\nThe main purpose of an evaluation tool is to help answer the questions: Is the reform\ndoing any good and, if so, is the good worth it? When the reform is curricular, concept\ninventories may be used to answer these questions when content and goals are shared by both\ncurricula (with and without reform) with approximately equal intensity.14 In the absence of\nthis alignment, concept inventories might be used to give some insight into whether anything\nis \"lost\" with respect to overlaping content and goals. However, concept inventories (used to\nmake comparisons) fail to measure what are perhaps the most interesting aspects of reform:\nthe non-overlapping content and goals that are simply not present in courses without reform.\nIn the case of M&I mechanics, examples of non-overlapping material includes both new\ngoals (e.g., relating macroscopic physics to microscopic models)16 and new content (e.g.,\ncomputation).18 There is a need to develop tools to help weigh the gains of a particular\n18\n\n\freform, so that instructors faced with multiple curricular choices can make informed decisions\nabout which concepts, principles, and methods should be included or excluded, emphasized\nor de-emphasized during the finite time available to them to teach the course.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe would like to thank Andrew Scherbakov and Robert Hume (Office of Minority Education and Development) for their efforts in collecting and organizing the demographic data.\nThis work was supported by National Science Foundation's Division of Undergraduate Education (DUE0618519 and DUE0942076).\n\n\u2217\n\nCurrent Address: Department of Physics, University of Colorado at Boulder, Boulder, CO\n80309; marcos.caballero@colorado.edu\n\n\u2020\n\nCorresponding Author: michael.schatz@physics.gatech.edu\n\n1\n\nP.
