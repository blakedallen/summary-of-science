We address nonlocality of a class of fully inseparable three-mode\nGaussian states generated either by bilinear three-mode Hamiltonians or by a\nsequence of bilinear two-mode Hamiltonians. Two different tests revealing strong\nnonlocality are considered, in which the dichotomic Bell operator is represented by\ndisplaced parity and by pseudospin operator respectively.

We found that the non Gaussian character\nof the conditional states allows violation of Bell's inequalities (by parity and\npseudospin tests) stronger than with a conventional twin-beam state. However,\nthe non Gaussian character is not sufficient to reveal nonlocality through a\ndichotomized quadrature measurement strategy.\n\n1. Introduction\nEinstein, Podolsky and Rosen (EPR) formulated their famous argument about the\ncompletness of quantum mechanics in the framework of continuous variable systems\n[1]. However, after that Bohm gave a dichotomized version of it [2], the debate\nconcerning nonlocality moved to systems described by discrete variables, leading Bell\nto formulate his celebrated inequalities in a dichotomized fashion [3]. Recently, the\nincreasing importance of continuous variable systems leads many authors to explore\nthe nonlocality issue in its original setting, where dichotomic observables to test Bell's\ninequalities are not uniquely determined. The attempts to translate Bell's inequalities\nto continuous variable systems clarified the fact that crucial in a nonlocality test is the\nexistence of a set of dichotomized bounded observables used to perform the test itself,\nfrom which the so called \"Bell operator\" is derived. The more debated question has\ndealt with the nonlocality of the normalized version of the original EPR state, i.e. the\ntwin-beam (TWB) state of radiation produced by spontaneuos downconversion in a\nparametric amplifier [4]. Nonlocality of the TWB state was not clear for a long time.\nUsing the Wigner function approach, Bell argued that the original EPR state, and as\na consequence the TWB too, does not exhibit nonlocality because its Wigner function\nis positive, and therefore represents a local hidden variable description [5]. More\nrecently, Banaszek and Wodkiewicz [6] showed instead how to reveal nonlocality of\nthe EPR state through the measurement of displaced parity operator. Furthermore a\nsubsequent work of Chen et al. [7] showed that TWB's violation of Bell's inequalities\nmay achieve the maximum value admitted by quantum mechanics upon a suitable\nchoice of the measured observables. Indeed, the amount of violation crucially depends\non the kind of Bell operator adopted in the analysis, ranging from no violation to\nmaximal violation for the same (entangled) quantum state.\n\n\fNonlocality of two- and three-mode continuous variable systems\n\n2\n\nSystems which involves only two parties are the simplest setting where to study\nviolation of local realism in quantum mechanics. A more complex scenario arises\nif multipartite systems are considered. Studying the peculiar quantum features\nof these systems is worthwhile in view of their relevance in the development of\nquantum communication technology, e.g. to manipulate and distribute information\nin a quantum communication network [8, 9]. Although the study of multipartite\nnonlocality has originated without the use of inequalities [10], an approach to\nderive Bell inequalities has been developed [11] also for these systems and applied\nto characterize their entanglement properties [12]. Being originally developed in\nthe framework of discrete variables, these multiparty Bell inequalities have found\napplication also in the characterization of continuous variable systems [13, 14].\nThe aim of this paper is to apply the various approaches hitherto developed to\ntest nonlocality of two- and three-mode continuous variable systems. We will consider\ntripartite Gaussian states as well as non-Gaussian bipartite states. In the first case\nstrong violation of Bell inequalities is found, allowing the Bell factor to reach values of\nB \u2243 3, while in the second case enhancement of nonlocality is obtained in comparison\nwith the TWB case.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2 we review the different approaches\nto test nonlocality in the framework of continuous variables and introduce notation\nthat will be used throughout the paper. The three-mode states we are interested in\nare introduced in Sec. 3, and their violation of local realism is analyzed in 3.1 and 3.2.\nIn Sec. 4, the tripartite states are considered as sources for conditional generation of\nnon-Gaussian bipartite states, whose nonlocal proprties are then studied in 4.1, 4.2\nand 4.3. Finally, the main results obtained are summarized in Sec. 5, which closes the\npaper with some concluding remarks.\n2. Nonlocality tests for continuous variables\nIn this section we will briefly recall the inequalities imposed by local realism in the\ncases of our interest. Let us start by focusing our attention on a bipartite system.\nLet m(\u03b11 ) = \u00b11 and m(\u03b1\u20321 ) = \u00b11 denote two possible outcomes of two possible\nmeasurements on the first subsystem and similarly m(\u03b12 ) = \u00b11 and m(\u03b1\u20322 ) = \u00b11 for\nthe second subsystem. The essential feature of this measurements is that they are\nlocal, dichotomic and bounded. The Bell's combination\nF2 \u2261 m(\u03b11 )m(\u03b12 ) + m(\u03b11 )m(\u03b1\u20322 ) + m(\u03b1\u20321 )m(\u03b12 ) \u2212 m(\u03b1\u20321 )m(\u03b1\u20322 ) (1)\n\nunder the assumption of local realism gives rise to the well known Bell-CHSH\ninequality [15]:\nB2 \u2261 |E(\u03b11 , \u03b12 ) + E(\u03b11 , \u03b1\u20322 ) + E(\u03b1\u20321 , \u03b12 ) \u2212 E(\u03b1\u20321 , \u03b1\u20322 )| \u2264 2 ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere E(\u03b11 , \u03b12 ) is the correlation function between the measurement results, i.e., the\nexpectation value of the products of the results of the experiments m(\u03b11 ) and m(\u03b12 ).\nIn the case of a n-partite system, a nonlocality test is possible using the BellKlyshko inequalities [11, 12] which provides a generalization of inequality (2). These\ninequalities are based on the following recursively defined linear combination:\n1\n1\n\u2032\n,\n(3)\nFn \u2261 [m(\u03b1n ) + m(\u03b1\u2032n )] Fn\u22121 + [m(\u03b1n ) \u2212 m(\u03b1\u2032n )] Fn\u22121\n2\n2\nwhere m(\u03b1n ) = \u00b11 and m(\u03b1\u2032n ) = \u00b11 refer to measurements on the n-party of the\nsystem, and Fn\u2032 denote the same expression as Fn but with all the \u03b1j and \u03b1\u2032j inverted.\n\n\fNonlocality of two- and three-mode continuous variable systems\n\n3\n\nIn the case of a three-partite system, local realism assumption imposes the following\ninequality from combination (3):\nB3 \u2261 |E(\u03b11 , \u03b12 , \u03b1\u20323 ) + E(\u03b11 , \u03b1\u20322 , \u03b13 ) + E(\u03b1\u20321 , \u03b12 , \u03b13 ) \u2212 E(\u03b1\u20321 , \u03b1\u20322 , \u03b1\u20323 )| \u2264 2 ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere again E(\u03b11 , \u03b12 , \u03b13 ) is the correlation function between the measurement results.\nQuantum mechanical systems\u221a\ncan violate inequalities (2) and(4) by a maximal amount\ngiven by, respectively, B2 \u2264 2 2 and B3 \u2264 4 (see, e.g., Ref. [12]).\nWe now briefly review three different strategies to reveal quantum nonlocality in\nthe framework of continuous variables systems. Recall that in the case of a discrete\nbipartite system, for example a spin- 21 two particle system, the local dichotomic\nbounded observable usually taken into account is the spin of the particle in a fixed\ndirection, say d . Hence the correlation between two measurements performed over\nthe two particles is E(d1 , d2 ) = hd1 \u03c3 \u2297 d2 \u03c3i, where the operator \u03c3 = (\u03c3x , \u03c3y , \u03c3z )\nis decomposed on the Pauli matrices base and d1 , d2 are two unit vectors. The Bell\noperator is then given by the expression:\nB2,sp = d1 \u03c3 \u2297 d2 \u03c3 + d\u20321 \u03c3 \u2297 d2 \u03c3 + d1 \u03c3 \u2297 d\u20322 \u03c3 \u2212 d\u20321 \u03c3 \u2297 d\u20322 \u03c3 .\n\n(5)\n\nConsider now a n-partite continuous variable system identified by the creation\noperator a\u2020j and the annihilation operator aj (j = 1, . . . , n) with boson commutation\nrelations associated. Following the original argument by EPR it is quite natural\nattempting to reveal the nonlocality of this system trying to infer quadratures of\none subsystem from those of the others. From now on, we will refer to this procedure\nas a \"Homodyne nonlocality test\", as quadrature measurements of radiation field\nare performed through homodyne detection. Here we identify the quadrature xj (\u03b8)\naccording to the definition x\u03b8j = \u221a12 (aj e\u2212i\u03b8 + a\u2020j ei\u03b8 ). As they are local but neither\nbounded nor dichotomic, quadrature observables are not immediately suitable to\nperform a nonlocality test based on Bell's inequalities. The procedure to make\nthem bounded and dichotomic is quite arbitrary and consist in the assignment of\ntwo domains D+ and D\u2212 to each observable [16]. When the result of a quadrature\nmeasurement falls in the domain D\u00b1 the value \u00b11 is associated to it. Usually the choice\nD\u00b1 = R\u00b1 is considered, though a choice suitable to the system under investigation\nmay be preferable. Considering a bipartite system we can introduce the following\nquantities:\nZ\nZ\n\u03c6\n\u03c6\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\ndx\u03c6\ndx1\nP++ (x1 , x2 ) =\n2 P (x1 , x2 )\nD+\nD+\nZ\nZ\n\u03c6\n\u03c6\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\ndx\u03c6\ndx1\nP+\u2212 (x1 , x2 ) =\n2 P (x1 , x2 )\nD\u2212\nD+\nZ\nZ\n\u03c6\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\ndx\u03c6\ndx\n)\n=\nP\u2212+ (x\u03b81 , x\u03c6\n1\n2 P (x1 , x2 )\n2\nD+\nD\u2212\nZ\nZ\n\u03c6\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\n(6)\ndx\u03c6\ndx\n)\n=\nP\u2212\u2212 (x\u03b81 , x\u03c6\n1\n2 P (x1 , x2 ) ,\n2\nD\u2212\n\nD\u2212\n\nP (x\u03b81 , x\u03c6\n2)\n\nwhere\nis the joint probability distribution of the quadratures x\u03b81 and x\u03c6\n2.\nWe can now identify the homodyne correlation function EH (\u03b8, \u03c6) as\n\n\u03c6\n\u03c6\n\u03c6\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\nEH (\u03b8, \u03c6) = P++ (x\u03b81 , x\u03c6\n2 )+P\u2212\u2212 (x1 , x2 )\u2212P+\u2212 (x1 , x2 )\u2212P\u2212+ (x1 , x2 ) , (7)\n\nwhich can be straightforwardly used to construct the Bell combination B2,H of Eq.(2)\nand to perform the nonlocality test. The main problem of pursuing such a nonlocality\n\n\fNonlocality of two- and three-mode continuous variable systems\n\n4\n\ntest is that it is not suitable in case of systems described\nby P\na positive Wigner\n\u221a\nfunction, as the TWB state of radiation defined as |Xi = 1 \u2212 X 2 n X n |n ni, where\nX = tanh r and r is the squeezing parameter. Indeed, a positive Wigner function can\nbe interpreted as a hidden phase-space probability distribution, preventing violation\nof Bell-CHSH inequality unless the measured observables have an unbounded Wigner\nrepresentation, which is not the case of the dichotomized quadrature measurement\ndescribed above. Considering in fact that P (x\u03b81 , x\u03c6\n2 ) can be determined as a marginal\ndistribution from the Wigner function one can write from Eqs. (6) and (7):\nZ\n\u03b8+ \u03c0\n\u03c6+ \u03c0\n\u03b8+ \u03c0\n\u03c6+ \u03c0\n\u03b8\n2\n2\n2\nEH (\u03b8, \u03c6) = dx\u03b81 dx\u03c6\ndx2 2 sgn(x\u03b81 , x\u03c6\n, x\u03c6\n),\n(8)\n2 dx1\n2 )W (x1 , x1\n2 , x2\n\nwhere the integration is performed over the whole phase-space and without loss of\ngenerality we have considered D\u00b1 = R\u00b1 . Eq.(8) itself is indeed a local hidden variable\ndescription of the correlation function, hence obeying inequality (2).\nIn order to overcome this obstacle different strategies have been considered by\nmany authors, based essentially on parity measurements. Banaszek and Wodkiewicz\n[6] demonstrated the nonlocality of the TWB considering as local observable on\nsubsystem j the parity operator on the state displaced by \u03b1j (hence we will refer\nto this procedure as a \"Displaced Parity (DP) nonlocality test\"), which is dichotomic\nand bounded:\n\u03a0(\u03b1) = \u2297nj=1 Dj (\u03b1j )(\u22121)nj Dj\u2020 (\u03b1j ).\n\n(9)\n\nIn the above formula, \u03b1 = (\u03b11 , ..., \u03b1n ), while nj = a\u2020 a and Dj (\u03b1j ) = exp[\u03b1j a\u2020j \u2212 \u03b1\u2217j aj ]\ndenote the number operator and the phase space displacement operator for the\nsubsystem j. Hence the correlation function reads:\nEDP (\u03b1) = h\u03a0(\u03b1)i,\n\n(10)\n\nfrom which Bell's combinations B2,DP in Eq.(2) and B3,DP in Eq.(4) can be easily\nreconstructed in the cases n = 2, 3. The reason why this procedure would be able to\nreveal nonlocality also in case of quantum states characterized by a positive Wigner\nfunction is clear using the following relation:\n\u0012 \u0013n\n2\nW (\u03b1) =\nh\u03a0(\u03b1)i .\n(11)\n\u03c0\n\nIndeed, the analog of Eq.(8) is:\n\u0012 \u0013n\nZ\n2\n2n\nW (\u03b1)\u03b4 (2n) (\u03b1 \u2212 \u03bb) .\nEDP (\u03b1) = d \u03bb\n\u03c0\n\n(12)\n\nBeing the Dirac-\u03b4 distribution unbounded, Ineqs. (2) and (4) are no more necessarily\nvalid for B2,DP and B3,DP . The maximal violation found with this procedure for a\nEPR state is B2,DP \u2243 2.32 [17], still far from the maximum violation admitted by\nquantum mechanics.\nAnother strategy, developed by Chen et al. [7], shares a similar behavior as the\none described above, allowing to reveal nonlocality for quantum states with positive\nWigner function. Interestingly, this type of nonlocality test, which we will refer to as\n\"Pseudospin (PS) nonlocality test\", admits a maximum violation for the EPR state.\nIt can be seen as a generalization to continuous variable systems of the one introduced\nby Gisin and Peres for the case of discrete variable systems [18], hence, for the case of\na pure bipartite system, it is equivalent to an entanglement test [17]. Let us consider\n\n\fNonlocality of two- and three-mode continuous variable systems\n\n5\n\nthe following set of operators, known as pseudospins in view of their commutation\nrelations, sj = (sjx , sjy , sjz ) acting on the j-th subsystem\nsjz\nsjx\n\n=\n\u00b1\n\ndj s j\nsj\u2212\nj\n\nP\u221e\n\nsjy\n\n=\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nn=0\n2sj\u00b1 ,\n\n\u0001\n|2n + 1ij h2n + 1| \u2212 |2nij h2n| ,\nj\n\nj\n\n= sjz cos \u03b8j + sin \u03b8j (ei\u03c6 sj\u2212 + e\u2212i\u03c6 sj+ ),\n(sj+ )\u2020\n\n(13)\n\nj\n\nwhere\n= n=0 |2nij h2n + 1| =\nand d is a unit vector associated to the\nangles \u03b8 and \u03c6j . In analogy to the spin- 12 system and defining d = (d1 , ..., dn ) the\ncorrelation function is simply given by:\nEP S (d) = h\u2297nj=1 dj sj i ,\n\n(14)\n\nfrom which the Bell combinations B2,P S and B3,P S are evaluated. Also different\nrepresentations of the spin- 21 algebra have been discussed in the recent literature\n[19, 20]. In particular in Ref. [20] it has been pointed out that different representations\nlead to different expectation values of the Bell operators. Hence, the violation of Bell\ninequality for continuous variable systems turns out to depend, besides to orientational\nparameters, also to configurational ones. In the following sections we will also consider\nthe pseudospin operators \u03a0j = (\u03a0jx , \u03a0jy , \u03a0jz ) taken into account in Ref. [20], which have\nthe following Wigner representation:\n1\nW\u03a0jy = \u2212\u03b4(xj ) P\nW\u03a0jx = sgn xj\n(15)\nW\u03a0jz = \u2212\u03c0\u03b4(xj )\u03b4(yj ) ,\nyj\n\u03c0\n\nwhere xj = x0j , yj = xj2 and P stands for the \"principal value\". The correlation\nfunction obtained using operators \u03a0j will be indicated as EP\u2032 S (d) = h\u2297nj=1 dj \u03a0j i.\n3. Three-mode nonlocality\nIn this section we will analyze the nonlocal properties of tripartite Gaussian states.\nIn particular we will consider two classes of states, the first one proposed by Van\nLoock and Braunstein [13], the second one proposed in [21]. The reason why we\nconsider this two classes is that the first is a very natural and scalable way to produce\nmultimode entanglement using only passive optical elements and single squeezers,\nwhile the second one is the simplest way to produce three mode entanglement using\na single nonlinear optical device. Indeed, both states can be achieved experimentally\n[22, 23]. As concern the first class of states, it is generated with the aid of three\nsingle mode squeezed states combined in a \"tritter\" (a three mode generalization of\na beam-splitter). The evolution is then ruled by a sequence of single and two mode\nquadratic Hamiltonians. As a consequence, being generated from vacuum, the threemode entangled state is Gaussian and its Wigner function is given by:\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0014\n1\nx\n\u22121\nWS (x, y) = 3 exp \u2212(x, y)C\n,\n(16)\ny\n\u03c0\n\nwhere x = (x1 , x2 , x3 ), y = (y1 , y2 , y3 ) are the positions and momenta of the three\nmodes and C\u22121 is the inverse of the covariance matrix, whose explicit expression\n\n\fNonlocality of two- and three-mode continuous variable systems\n\n6\n\nreads:\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\nC=\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\nR S\nS R\nS S\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n\nS\n0\nS\n0\nR 0\n0 T\n0 \u2212S\n0 \u2212S\n\n0\n0\n0\n\u2212S\nT\n\u2212S\n\n0\n0\n0\n\u2212S\n\u2212S\nT\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7 ,\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n(17)\n\nwhere R = cosh 2r + 13 sinh 2r, T = cosh 2r \u2212 31 sinh 2r, S = \u2212 34 cosh r sinh r and r is\nthe squeezing parameter (with equal squeezing in all initial modes). The second class\nof tripartite entangled states is generated in a single non linear crystal through the\nfollowing interaction Hamiltonian:\nHint = \u03b31 a\u20201 a\u20203 + \u03b32 a\u20202 a3 + H.c. .\n\n(18)\n\nHint describes two interlinked bilinear interactions taking place among three modes\nof the radiation field coupled with the support of two parametric pumps. It\ncan be realized in \u03c7(2) media by a suitable configuration exposed in Ref. [23].\nNotice that the same dynamics can be implemented in different physical systems,\nincluding optomechanical couplers and Bose-Einstein condensates in the linear regime\n[24, 25, 26]. The effective coupling constants \u03b3j , j = 1, 2, of the two parametric\nprocesses are proportional to the nonlinear susceptibilities and the pump intensities.\nIf we take the vacuum |0i \u2261 |0i1 \u2297 |0i2 \u2297 |0i3 as the initial state, the evolved state\n|Ti = e\u2212iHint t |0i belongs to the class of the coherent states of SU (2, 1) and it reads\n[24, 27]:\ns\nX \u0012 N2 \u0013p/2 \u0012 N3 \u0013q/2\n1\n(p + q)!\n\u2212i(p\u03c62 +q\u03c63 )\n|p+q, p, qi , (19)\ne\n|Ti = \u221a\n1 + N1\np!q!\n1 + N1 pq 1 + N1\nwhere Nj (t) = ha\u2020j (t)a(t)i represent the average number of photons in the j-th mode\nand \u03c6j are phase factors. The explicit expressions of Nj (t) are:\n|\u03b31 |2 |\u03b32 |2\n2\n[cos \u03a9t \u2212 1] ,\n\u03a94\n|\u03b31 |2\nsin2 (\u03a9t) ,\nN3 =\n\u03a92\n\nN2 =\n\n(20)\np\nwith \u03a9 = |\u03b32 |2 \u2212 |\u03b31 |2 and N1 = N2 +N3 . Also for this second class, being the initial\nstate Gaussian and the Hamiltonian quadratic, the evolved states will be Gaussian.\nThe Wigner function reads as follows [21, 28]:\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0014\n1\nx\n,\n(21)\nWT (x, y) = 3 exp \u2212(x, y)V\u22121\ny\n\u03c0\nwhere V\u22121 is the inverse of the covariance matrix, whose\n\uf8eb\nF\nA\nB\n0\n\u2212D \u2212E\n\uf8ec A\nG\nC\n\u2212D\n0\nL\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec B\nC\nH\n\u2212E\n\u2212L\n0\nV=\uf8ec\n\uf8ec 0\n\u2212D\n\u2212E\nF\n\u2212A\n\u2212B\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed \u2212D\n0\n\u2212L \u2212A G\nC\n\u2212E\nL\n0\n\u2212B\nC\nH\n\nexplicit expression is:\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7 ,\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n(22)\n\n\fNonlocality of two- and three-mode continuous variable systems\n\n7\n\nwhere\np\np\nA = 2 N2 (1 + N1 ) cos \u03c62 D = 2 N2 (1 + N1 ) sin \u03c62 F = 2N1 + 1\np\np\nB = 2 N3 (1 + N1 ) cos \u03c63 E = 2 N3 (1 + N1 ) sin \u03c63\nG = 2N2 + 1\np\np\nC = 2 N2 N3 cos(\u03c62 \u2212 \u03c63 ) L = 2 N2 N3 sin(\u03c62 \u2212 \u03c63 ) H = 2N3 + 1 .\n\n(23)\n\nBoth classes of states are fully inseparable for any value of the coupling constants,\nnamely cannot be written as a factorized state for any grouping of the modes.\nTherefore they are good candidates to reveal true tripartite nonlocality. Being\nGaussian states, however, nonlocality cannot be revealed by homodyne detection.\nIn the following we analyze the results for displaced parity and pseudospin tests.\n3.1. Displaced parity test\n\nLet us start the study of tripartite systems nonlocality using the \"displaced parity\ntest\". Considering the correlation function EDP (\u03b1) given by Eq. (10), the state\n(16) was found in [13] to give a maximal violation of B3,DP \u2243 2.32 in the limit of\nlarge squeezing and small displacement. The study in [13] however was performed\nfor a particular \u221a\nchoice of displacement parameters: \u03b11 = \u03b12 = \u03b13 = 0 and\n\u03b1\u20321 = \u03b1\u20322 = \u03b1\u20323 = i J . A numerical optimization of the displacement parameters lead\nus to identify a number of parameterizations that allow a significantly higher violation\n\u221a\nof Bell's inequality. As an\nexample, consider the one given by \u03b11 = \u03b12 = \u03b13 = i J\n\u221a\nand \u03b1\u20321 = \u03b1\u20322 = \u03b1\u20323 = \u22122i J from which follows that\n\u0001\n\u0001\nB3,DP = 3 exp \u221212e\u22122r J \u2212 exp 24e2r J ,\n(24)\n\nhence the remarkably high asymptotic value of B3,DP = 3 is found for large r and\nJ =\n6 0 (see Fig. 1). The importance of a suitable choice of the displacement parameters\nis apparent if this asymptotic value is compared to the violations obtained in the\nnonlocality study performed in Ref. [13]. In that work in fact generalizations to more\nthan three modes of state (16) were also considered, giving an increasing violation\nof Bell inequality as the number of modes increases, but never founding a violation\ngreater than 2.8 . Determining the optimal choice of the displacement parameters for\na given state is in general a challenging task. To our knowledge indeed there exists\nno general prescription to find it out, and ultimately one must rely onto a numerical\nanalysis (see, e.g. [29]). Nevertheless, a careful inspection of the symmetries of the\nstate under consideration may be helpful. In order to clarify this observation let us\nconsider the explicit expression of the correlation function EDP (\u03b11 , \u03b12 , \u03b13 ) for state\n(16):\n\u001a\n\u0002\n\u0003\n2\nE(\u03b11 , \u03b12 , \u03b13 ) = exp \u2212 e2 r (y1 + y2 + y3 )2 + (x2 \u2212 x3 )2 + (x2 \u2212 x1 )2 + (x1 \u2212 x3 )2\n3\n\u001b\n\u0003\n2 \u22122 r \u0002\n2\n2\n2\n2\n(25)\n(x1 + x2 + x3 ) + (y2 \u2212 y3 ) + (y2 \u2212 y1 ) + (y1 \u2212 y3 )\n\u2212 e\n3\nHence, from Eq. (4) it follows that the Bell combination B3,DP is given by the sum\nof three positive and one negative term. It is reasonable to expect that the maximal\nviolation of nonlocality will be achieved for large r. We see from Eq. (25) that, in\nthis limit, all the correlation functions in B3,DP vanish for nonzero displacements,\nunless the coefficients of e2 r are zero. Hence we impose the following system of\n\n\fNonlocality of two- and three-mode continuous variable systems\n\n8\n\nequations, which allows for the three positive terms in B3,DP not to vanish (we consider\n\u03b1k = xk + i yk and \u03b1\u2032k = x\u2032k + i yk\u2032 for k = 1, 2, 3):\n(y1\u2032 + y2 + y3 )2 + (x2 \u2212 x3 )2 + (x2 \u2212 x\u20321 )2 + (x\u20321 \u2212 x3 )2 = 0\n\n(y1 + y2\u2032 + y3 )2 + (x\u20322 \u2212 x3 )2 + (x\u20322 \u2212 x1 )2 + (x1 \u2212 x3 )2 = 0\n(y1 + y2 + y3\u2032 )2 + (x2 \u2212 x\u20323 )2 + (x2 \u2212 x1 )2 + (x1 \u2212 x\u20323 )2 = 0 .\n\n(26)\n\nWe see that the parameterization used to obtain Eq. (24) is a solution of this system.\nClearly, any other solution will give, in the limit of large r, the same violation given\nby Eq. (24), namely B3,DP \u2192 3. In order to compare the violation of Bell's inequality\nadmitted by the state (16) with the one that will be obtained below considering the\nstate (19) , it is useful to rewrite Eq.(24) as a function of total mean photon number\nN = N1 + N2 + N3 . Given that N = 3 sinh2 r and optimizing the displacement J\nwe obtain the result shown in Fig 3. The asymptotic\nof the optimized\n\u0011\n\u0010q expression\n\ndisplacement as a function of N is J =\nare required.\n\n1\n8N ArcSinh\n\nN\n3\n\n, hence very small angles\n\n3\n\n1.5\n\n2.8\n1\n\n2.6\nB\n2.4\n\nr\n\n2.2\n\n0.5\n\n2\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n0.6\n\n0\n\nJ\n\nFigure 1. Plot of the Bell combination (24). Only values violating Bell Inequality\n(4) are shown.\n\nConsider now the tripartite state generated by the Hamiltonian (18). The\ncorrelation function is now given by Eq. (10) through the Wigner function (21).\nThe symmetry of the state suggests a maximum violation of Bell inequality for\nN2 = N3 = N4 (recalling Eq. (20)), while the fact that the separability of the state\ndoesn't depend on the phases \u03c62 and \u03c63 [21] suggests that they are not crucial for the\nnonlocality test. If we consider the same parametrization that led us to Eq. (24) and\nfix \u03c62 = \u03c63 = \u03c0, we find:\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u221a \u221a\n\u221a \u221a\n3\n6 J 1+N +2 2 N (2+N )\nJ 4+7 N +6 2 N (2+N )\n\u22121 + e\n+ 2 e2\n\u0011\n\u0010\n,\n(27)\nB3,DP =\n\u221a \u221a\n4 J 3+3 N +2 2 N (2+N )\ne\nfrom which follows an asymptotic violation of Bell's inequalities of B3,DP \u2243 2.89, for\nlarge N and small J . A slightly better result is found if a parametrization,\n\u221a more\nsuitable and numerically optimized for state (19), is considered: \u03b11 = 23 J , \u03b12 =\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u03b13 = \u03b1\u20321 = 0, \u03b1\u20322 = \u2212 J , \u03b1\u20323 = J , \u03c62 = 0 and \u03c62 = \u03c0. The Bell combination B3,DP\nfor this choice of parameters is depicted in Fig. 2. We note that in this case a larger\nchoice of angles allows the violation of Bell inequality if compared with Fig. 1.

The displacement parameters J have been optimized to give the maximum\nvalue of B for N fixed.\n\nbefore, optimizing the displacement J for each N , it is possible to find the maximum\nviolation of Bell inequality as a function of N . We find that the asymptotic relation\nbetween the optimized displacement and the total photon number is now J N \u2243 3.21,\nconfirming that not too small displacements are required. The asymptotic violation\nof Bell's inequality is now B3,DP \u2243 2.99. To compare the results obtained for the\ntwo states (16) and (19) we have plotted in Fig. 3 the Bell combination B3,DP as a\nfunction of the mean total energy N , while the displacement J has been chosen in\norder to maximize B3,DP at fixed energy. Notice that even if the two states have quite\nthe same asymptotic violation, state (16) reaches it for lower energies.\n3.2. Pseudospin test\nConsider now the pseudospin nonlocality test.

The correlation function then, according to Eqs. (13) and\n(14), reads as follows:\nEP S (d) = cos \u03b81 cos \u03b82 cos \u03b83 + c1 cos \u03b81 sin \u03b82 sin \u03b83 (cos \u03c62 cos \u03c63 + sin \u03c62 sin \u03c63 )\n+ c2 cos \u03b82 sin \u03b81 sin \u03b83 (cos \u03c61 cos \u03c63 \u2212 sin \u03c61 sin \u03c63 )\n+ c3 cos \u03b83 sin \u03b81 sin \u03b82 (cos \u03c61 cos \u03c62 + sin \u03c61 sin \u03c62 )\n\n(29)\n\nHence, without loss of generality, we can fix for example \u03c61 = 0 and \u03c62 = \u03c63 = \u03c0\nand look for the maximum violation of Bell inequality (4) constructed from Eq. (29).\nNotice that if the coefficients ci (i = 1, 2, 3) were equal to one then the maximum\nviolation admitted, B3,P S = 4, should be reached. Considering Eqs. (28) two limiting\ncases can be studied. First, for large N2 and small N3 (or vice-versa) a numerical\nevaluation of the coefficients ci shows that c3 \u2192 1, while the other two vanish. Hence,\nconsidering \u03b83 = 0, the correlation function (29) reduces to that of a TWB subjected\nto a pseudospin nonlocality\ntest (see Eq. (39) below), hence allowing an asymptotic\n\u221a\nviolation of B3,P S = 2 2. This result should be expected, since in this limiting case\nthe state (19) reduces to a TWB for modes a1 and a2 , while mode a3 remains in the\nvacuum state and factors out. Consider now the case in which N2 = N3 = N4 . A\nnumerical evaluation shows that the coefficients ci \u2192 21 for large N , hence also in this\ncase the maximum violation cannot be attained. The asymptotic violation turns out\nto be B3,P S \u2243 2.63.\nAs already mentioned in Sec. 2 other representations for the pseudospin operators\ncan be considered. Using Eqs. (15) and (21) it is possible to calculate the correlation\nfunction EP\u2032 S (d). Setting again the azimuthal angles \u03c6i = 0, the latter shows the\nsame structure as EP S (d) where now the coefficient ci are replaced by:\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u221a\n2 arctan 2\u221aN\n2 arctan N\n1+N\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n.\n(30)\nc2 = c3 =\nc1 =\n\u03c0(1 + N )\n\u03c0(1 + N2 )\nAn appropriate choice of angles leads to a maximal violation of Bell's inequality given\nby B3,P S \u2243 2.22 (see Fig. 4), which is now reached for N \u2243 1, value for which\nthe coefficients c\u2032i are approximately near their maxima. As already pointed out, we\nsee that different representations of the pseudospin operators give rise to different\nexpectation values for the Bell operator.\nApplying now the same procedure to state (16) we find the same structure for\nthe correlation function EP\u2032 S , where the coefficients are now given by:\nc\u20321\n\n=\n\nc\u20322\n\n=\n\nc\u20323\n\nsinh(r)\n\u221a\n\u22126 arctan( 4 cosh(r)\n)\n3(2+e4 r )\np\n=\n.\n\u03c0 5 + 4 cosh(4 r)\n\n(31)\n\n\fNonlocality of two- and three-mode continuous variable systems\n\n11\n\nAfter an optimization of the angles \u03b8i we obtain a maximal violation of B3,P S \u2243 2.09\n(see Fig. 4), for r \u2243 0.42 (N \u2243 0.56) that maximizes the coefficients ci .\n2.2\n\nB\n\n2.1\n2\n1.9\n1.8\n0\n\n2\n\n4\nN\n\n6\n\n8\n\nFigure 4.

Degaussified state and two mode nonlocality\nIn this section we consider the tripartite state (19) as a source of two-mode states. In\nparticular, we study the nonlocality of a two-mode non-Gaussian state obtained by a\nconditional measurement performed on state (19). Gaussian states are at the heart\nof quantum information processing with continuous variables. The reason for this is\nthat Gaussian is the character of the vacuum state of quantum electrodynamics. This\nobservation, in combination with the fact that the quantum evolutions achievable\nwith current technology are described by Hamiltonian operators at most bilinear\nin the quantum fields, accounts for the fact that the states commonly produced in\nlaboratories are Gaussian. In fact, bilinear evolutions preserve the Gaussian character\nof the vacuum state. In addition, it is worth noticing that the operation of tracing\nout a mode from a multipartite Gaussian state preserves the Gaussian character too,\nand the same observation is valid when the evolution of a state in a standard noisy\nchannel is considered. Indeed, the only feasible way to \"degaussify\" a state is through\na conditional measurement, or by statistically mixing it with another Gaussian state.\nThe reason to study non-Gaussian states is that when the Gaussian character is lost,\nthen immediately the Wigner function of the state becomes negative, for pure states,\nhence stronger nonclassical properties should emerge. Actually, various authors have\nrecently investigated the nonlocality properties of two-mode non-Gaussian states. In\nparticular, a twin-beam state subjected to inconclusive photon subtraction (IPS state)\nhas been considered in Refs. [30] and [31], while in Ref. [17] it has been pointed out\nthat if the entangled coherent states [32] could\u221abe produced experimentally they would\nallow for the maximal violation (i.e., B2 = 2 2) both in case of a DP test as well as\na PS test.\nThe most natural way to obtain a non-Gaussian state from a Gaussian one is by\nelimination of its vacuum component. In fact, such\ndescribed\nR a state is necessarily\n2\nby a negative Wigner function (in fact h0|\u033a|0i \u221d d2n \u03b1W (\u03b1)e\u22122|\u03b1| ). Do to the\nstructure of state (19) its vacuum component can be subtracted by a conditional\nmeasurement on mode a3 , the same observation being valid for mode a2 . Consider\na photodetector able to distinguish only the presence or the lack of photons, i.e., an\n\n\fNonlocality of two- and three-mode continuous variable systems\n\n12\n\nON/OFF photodetector, and the state \u033a1 conditioned to the presence of at least\none photon. The probability operator measure (POVM) is two-valued {\u03a00 , \u03a01 },\n\u03a00 + \u03a01 = I, with the element associated to the \"no photons\" result given by\nX\n\u03a00 = I1 \u2297 I2 \u2297\n(1 \u2212 \u03b7)n |ni33 hn| ,\n(32)\nn\n\nwhere \u03b7 is the efficiency of the photodetector.

To calculate the Wigner\nfunction associated with state \u03c11 , consider that the characteristic function of the\nPOVM \u03a01 reads as follows:\n\u0015\n\u0014\n2\u2212\u03b7\n1\n,\n(35)\n\u03c7[\u03a01 ](\u03bc) = \u03c0\u03b4 2 (\u03bc) \u2212 exp \u2212|\u03bc|2\n\u03b7\n2\u03b7\nhence the characteristic function of \u033a1 is given by:\n\u0015\u001b\n\u001a\n\u0014\nZ 2\n1\n1\nd \u03bc\n2\u2212\u03b7\n\u03c7[\u033a1 ](\u03bb1 , \u03bb2 ) =\n.(36)\n\u03c7[|T ihT |](\u03bb1 , \u03bb2 , 0) \u2212\n\u03c7[|T ihT |](\u03bb1 , \u03bb2 , \u03bc) exp \u2212|\u03bc|2\nP1\n\u03b7\n\u03c0\n2\u03b7\nAfter some algebra the Wigner function associated with state \u03c11 can now be calculated.\nIt reads as follows:\n(\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0014\n2\n1 + \u03b7N3\n1\n2\nx\n\u22121\n\u221a\nW1 (x, y) =\nexp \u2212(x, y) (V\u2032 )\ny\n4\u03b7N3\n\u03c0\ndet V \u2032\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015 )\n\u0014\n\u0012 \u00132\n\u0001\u2032 x\n1 2\n2\n\u221a\n,\n(37)\nexp \u2212(x, y) D\u22121\n\u2212\ny\n\u03b7 \u03c0\ndet D\n\u0001\n2\u2212\u03b7\nwhere, from now on, x = (x1 , x2 ), y = (y1 , y2 ), and D = V + diag 0, 0, 2\u2212\u03b7\n.\n\u03b7 , 0, 0, \u03b7\n\u2032\nIn order to simplify the notation we have indicated with O the 4 \u00d7 4 matrix obtained\nfrom the 6 \u00d7 6 matrix O deleting the elements corresponding to the third mode (3-th\nrow/column and 6-th row/column), due to the trace over the 3-th mode. Of course,\nthe easiest way to obtain a bipartite state from state (19) is to discard a mode, say\nthe third one, by tracing over it. The state \u033aT r then obtained is simply given by the\nfollowing Wigner function:\n\u0012 \u00132\n\u0012\n\u0014\n\u0013\u0015\n1\n2\nx\n\u2032 \u22121\n\u221a\nWT r (x, y) =\nexp \u2212(x, y) (V )\n.\n(38)\ny\n\u03c0\n4 det V \u2032\nBeing the Wigner function WT r Gaussian, we expect that this state will exhibit weaker\nnonlocality with respect to state (34). In the rest of the section the nonlocal properties\n\n\fNonlocality of two- and three-mode continuous variable systems\n\n13\n\nof the usual TWB state and of the states (34) and (38) will be compared. Notice that\nstate (16) can be considered as an extension to three modes of the TWB. All the three\nnonlocality tests introduced in Sec. 2 will be taken into account.\n4.1. Displaced parity test\nWe first study the violation of inequality (2) in the case of a \"displaced parity\ntest\". As already mentioned, in Ref. [6] Banaszek and Wodkiewicz found for the\nfirst time that the TWB state exhibit a violation of local realism. They obtained the\nfollowing asymptotic violation for infinite energy: B2,DP \u2243 2.19. Generalizing their\nprocedure this result can be improved, yielding to a maximum asymptotic violation\nof B2,DP \u2243 2.32 [17]. We have considered the following\nparametrization to obtain\nthe\n\u221a\n\u221a\nmaximum violation for a TWB: \u03b11 = \u2212\u03b12 = i J and \u03b1\u20321 = \u2212\u03b1\u20322 = \u22123i J . The\nasymptotic relation between the squeezing parameter and the displacement angles is\n3\ne2r J = log\n32 . Using the same parametrization and considering the Bell combination\nB2,DP for the state \u033aT r , it turns out that the same asymptotic value of the TWB\nis reached for large N2 and small N3 . In fact, as already noticed, when this limit\nis considered the original tripartite state (19) reduces to a factorized state composed\nby a TWB and the vacuum state. Consider now the conditional state \u03c11 and again\nthe case of large N2 and small N3 , say N3 = 10\u22122 N12 . As in the tripartite case\nthe phase coefficients \u03c62 and \u03c63 play no rule in the characterization of nonlocality.\nA stronger violation of Bell inequality is then found\n\u221a and it is depicted in Fig. (5),\nwhere the parametrization \u03b11 = 12 \u03b12 = 13 \u03b1\u20321 = i J and \u03b1\u20322 = 0 has been adopted.\nIndeed the asymptotic violation is higher then the previous, namely B2DP \u2243 2.41.\n\n2.4\n2.3\nB\n2.2\n\n5\n4\n\n2.1\n3\n\n2\n0\n2\n\nN2\n\n0.1\nJ\n\n1\n0.2\n\nFigure 5.\nBell combination obtained choosing optimized displacement\nparameters for state \u033a1 (see text for details). Only values violating inequality\n(2) are shown.\n\nIt can be found, for large N2 , when J N2 \u2243 0.042. A comparison with the violation\nof nonlocality attained with a IPS state shows an identical asymptotic behavior [31].\nNevertheless, the scheme proposed here offers the advantage that the production rate\nof state \u033a1 [i.e., the conditional probability (33)] is much greater then the production\nrate of IPS state [see Ref. [33], Eq.(14)]. This is due to the fact that only a single\nON/OFF detection is required to produce \u033a1 , rather than the coincidence of two\n\n\fNonlocality of two- and three-mode continuous variable systems\n\n14\n\nON/OFF detections for the case of IPS state. This could be useful from a practical\nviewpoint.\n4.2. Pseudospin test\nLet us now focus on the \"pseudospin nonlocality test\". Considering a TWB state, it\nis known that the correlation function (14) has the following expression (setting to\nzero the azimuthal angles) [7]:\nEP S (\u03b81 , \u03b82 ) = cos \u03b81 cos \u03b82 + fT W B sin \u03b81 sin \u03b82 ,\n\n(39)\n\nwhere, denoting with N the total photon number,\np\nN (N + 2)\nfT W B =\n.\n(40)\n1+N\nIt turns out that the violation\n\u221a of Bell inequality in this contest increases monotonically\nto the maximum value of 2 2 as the function fT W B goes to unity. A straightforward\ncalculation shows that an expression identical in form to Eq. (39) can be found both\nin case of state \u033a1 and \u033aT r , where the following functions f1 and fT r can be identified:\nr\nr\n\u0013p \u0012\n\u00132 k\n\u0012\n\u221e\nX\nN2\n(1 + N3 \u03b7)\nN2\nN3\n(2 k + p)! 2 k + p + 1\np\nf1 = 2\n(1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03b7) )\n,\n1 + N1 N3 (1 + N1 ) \u03b7\n(2 k)! p!\n2k +1\n1 + N1\n1 + N1\nk,p=0\nr\nr\n\u00132 p \u0012\n\u00132 q\n\u221e \u0012\nX\nN2\nN2\n1\nN3\n(2 p + 2 q)! 2 q + 2 p + 1\nfT r = 2\n.\n(41)\n1 + N1 1 + N1 p,q=0 1 + N1\n1 + N1\n(2 p)! (2 q)!\n2p+1\n\nIn order to compare the violations in the three different cases, let us fix as in the\nprevious subsection a small value for N3 . A plot of the functions fT W B , f1 and fT r\nversus the total number of photons of the TWB for the former and of the initial threepartite state for the latter two is given in Fig. (6). It can be seen that state \u033a1 achives\nlarge violations for smaller energies with respect to the other two states. Finally, a\ncomparison with the violation attained with the IPS state may be found in Ref. [34].\n1.0\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\nN\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\nFigure 6.

Homodyne detection\n\nThe negativity of the Wigner function (37) may suggest to perform a nonlocality\ntest based upon a Homodyne detection scheme. While the positivity of a Wigner\nfunction avoid to violate Bell inequality (2) with such a test, its negativity is yet\nnot sufficient in general to ensure a violation. Quantum states with negative Wigner\nfunction that doesn't violate local realism with a homodyne test are given for example\nin Refs. [35]. Considering state (34) it is necessary to calculate the correlation function\n(8). Substituting the Wigner function (37) into Eq. (8) and performing the integral\nwe obtain the following result:\n\uf8f6\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\n\uf8eb\n( \u0012 \u0013\n2\n1 + \u03b7N3\n1\n2\n2 cos \u03c8\n\uf8f8\uf8fb\n\uf8f02 (1 + 2 N3 ) \u03c0 arctan \uf8ed q\n\u221a\nEH (\u03c8) =\n\u2212\n(1+2 N1 ) (1+2 N2 )\n4\u03b7N3\n\u03c0\ndet V \u2032\n2\u03c8\n\u2212\n4\ncos\n(1+N1 ) N2\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f6\uf8f9 )\n\u0012 \u00132\n2\n2\ncos\n\u03c8\n2\n\u03c0\n(\u22121\n+\nN\n(\u22122\n+\n\u03b7))\n1 2\n3\n\uf8f0\n\uf8f8\uf8fb(42),\n\u221a\narctan \uf8ed q\n\u2212\n(1+2 N1 \u2212N3 \u03b7) (1+2 N2 +N3 \u03b7)\n\u03b7 \u03c0\n1 + N3 \u03b7\ndet D\n2\n\u2212 4 cos \u03c8\n(1+N1 ) N2\n\nwhere \u03c8 = \u03b8 + \u03c6 + \u03c62 . A plot of the correlation function (42) is depicted in\nFig. (4.3) for unitary efficiency \u03b7, together with the classical correlation function of two\nspin- 12 particles [36] (see caption for details). Unfortunately, the comparison shows\nclearly that the correlation given by Eq. (42) is always lower then the classical one,\nhence despite the negativity of Wigner function (37) no violation of Bell inequality is\nachievable with this scheme.\n1\n0.5\nEH\n\n0\n- 0.5\n-1\n0\n\np\n\np\n\n3p\n\n4\n\n2\ny\n\n4\n\np\n\nFigure 7.

Conclusions\nA detailed analysis of the nonlocality properties of multipartite continuous variables\nsystems obtained by parametric optical systems has been presented, using the more\nrecent approaches developed to this aim. We have considered in particular two\nclasses of tripartite Gaussian states that seems promising for quantum communication\npurposes in order to implement multipartite quantum protocols. The results show\nthat for these states a nonlocality test based on displaced parity measurements is\nmore suitable to reveal violation of local realism than one based on pseudospin\n\n\fNonlocality of two- and three-mode continuous variable systems\n\n16\n\noperators. This results are just the opposite of what have been obtained for the\nbipartite case. Notice, however, that a systematic approach to pseudospin operators\nfor continuous variables haven't been developed yet, hence we have only used the\ntwo inequivalent configurational parameterizations more suitable for calculations. For\ndisplaced parity test we obtained a remarkably high asymptotic value for the Bell\nparameter, B3,DP \u2243 3. In this case the choice of a proper parametrization, suitable\nfor the state under investigation, have revealed crucial.\nWe have also explored the possibility to enhance nonlocality in bipartite systems\nconsidering states endowed with a nonpositive Wigner function. We investigated a\nmethod to conditionally produce such a state from the tripartite systems considered\nabove. As expected, the Bell parameter reaches a value higher than for a TWB, namely\nB2,DP \u2243 2.41. Also in the case of a pseudospin test an enhancement of nonlocality has\nbeen demonstrated, while a violation of local realism using a dichotomic quadrature\nmeasurement cannot be achieved.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors are grateful to S.
