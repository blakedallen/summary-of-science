One such background\nof type IIB string, the warped deformed conifold, was constructed in [5]. It was argued\nto be dual to 4-dimensional N = 1 supersymmetric SU(M(p + 1)) \u00d7 SU(Mp) gauge\ntheory [6] whose flow exhibits an RG cascade [5, 7]. In each cascade step the integer p\ndecreases by 1 through the Seiberg duality [8].\nIn this talk we show that the warped deformed conifold of [5] incorporates a supergravity dual of the supersymmetric Goldstone mechanism, and identify a pseudo-scalar\nGoldstone boson and its scalar superpartner. An old puzzle guides our investigation:\nwhat is the gauge theory interpretation of D1-branes in the deformed conifold background [5]? The interpretation of the fundamental strings placed in the IR region of\nthe metric is clear: they are dual to confining strings. Like the fundamental strings, the\nD-strings fall to the bottom of the throat, \u03c4 = 0, where they remain tensionful; hence,\nthey cannot be dual to 't Hooft loops which must be screened [5]. We propose instead\nthat in the dual gauge theory they are solitonic strings that create a monodromy of\na massless pseudo-scalar Goldstone boson field.1 For this explanation to make sense,\nthe IR gauge theory must differ from the pure glue N = 1 theory in that it contains a\nmassless pseudo-scalar bound state (glueball). The fact that this massless mode must\ncouple directly to a D-string means that it corresponds to a certain perturbation of\nthe RR 2-form potential, which turns out to mix with the RR 4-form potential. We\nexhibit the necessary ansatz in section 3, and indeed find a massless glueball. This\nmode should be interpreted as the Goldstone boson of spontaneously broken global\nU(1) baryon number symmetry. Its presence supports the claim made in [5, 9] that the\ncascading gauge theory is on the baryonic branch [10], i.e. certain baryonic operators\nacquire expectation values. The supersymmetric Goldstone mechanism gives rise also\nto a massless scalar mode. In section 4 the supergravity dual of this mode is identified as a massless glueball coming from a mixture of an NS-NS 2-form and a metric\ndeformation. The ansatz for such perturbations was written down some time ago in\n[11].\nBesides being an interesting example of the gauge/gravity duality, the warped de1\n\nWe are grateful to E. Witten for emphasizing this possibility to us.\n\n1\n\n\fformed conifold background offers interesting possibilities for solving the hierarchy\nproblem along the lines suggested in [12, 13]. If the background is embedded into a\ncompact CY space with NS-NS and R-R fluxes, then an exponential hierarchy may be\ncreated between the UV compactification scale and the IR scale at the bottom of the\nthroat [5, 14]. Models of this type received an additional boost due to a possibility of\nfixing all moduli proposed in [15], and a subsequent exploration of cosmology in [16].\nRecently, a new role was proposed for various (p, q) strings placed in the IR region [17].\nBesides being the confining or solitonic strings from the point of view of the gauge\ntheory, they may be realizations of cosmic strings. The exponential warping of the\nbackground lowers the tension significantly, and makes them plausible cosmic string\ncandidates. In section 5 we discuss the Higgs mechanism that occurs upon embedding\nthe warped deformed conifold into a flux compactification, and argue that a D-string\nplaced at the bottom of the throat is dual to an Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen string in the\ngauge theory coupled to supergravity. We conclude in section 6.\n\n2\n\nReview of the Warped Deformed Conifold\n\nThe conifold may be described by the following equation in four complex variables,\n4\nX\n\nza2 = 0 .\n\n(2.1)\n\na=1\n\nSince this equation is invariant under an overall real rescaling of the coordinates, this\nspace is a cone and admits the metric [18]\nds26 = dr 2 + r 2 ds2T 1,1 ,\nwhere\nds2T 1,1 =\n\n2\nX\n1\ncos \u03b8i d\u03c6i\nd\u03c8 +\n9\ni=1\n\n\u0012\n\n\u00132\n\n+\n\n2 \u0010\n\u0011\n1X\nd\u03b8i2 + sin2 \u03b8i d\u03c62i\n6 i=1\n\n(2.2)\n\n(2.3)\n\nis the metric on T 1,1 . Here \u03c8 is an angular coordinate which ranges from 0 to 4\u03c0, while\n(\u03b81 , \u03c61 ) and (\u03b82 , \u03c62 ) parametrize two S2 s in a standard way. Therefore, this form of the\nmetric shows that T 1,1 is an S1 bundle over S2 \u00d7 S2 . Topologically, T 1,1 \u223c S2 \u00d7 S3 .\n\n2\n\n\fNow placing N D3-branes at the apex of the cone we find the metric\nL4\nds = 1 + 4\nr\n2\n\n!\u22121/2\n\n\u0010\n\n\u2212(dx0 )2 + (dx1 )2 + (dx2 )2 + (dx3 )2\nL4\n+ 1+ 4\nr\n\n!1/2\n\n\u0011\n\n(2.4)\n\n(dr 2 + r 2 ds2T 1,1 ) ,\n\nwhose near-horizon (r \u2192 0) limit is AdS5 \u00d7 T 1,1 . The same logic that leads us to the\nmaximally supersymmetric version of the AdS/CFT correspondence now shows that\nthe type IIB string theory on this space should be dual to the infrared limit of the\nfield theory on N D3-branes placed at the singularity of the conifold. Since Calabi-Yau\nspaces with these D-branes preserve 1/4 of the original supersymmetries, we have an\nN = 1 superconformal field theory. This field theory was constructed in [19, 20]: it\nis SU(N) \u00d7 SU(N) gauge theory coupled to two chiral superfields, Ai , in the (N, N)\nrepresentation and two chiral superfields, Bj , in the (N, N) representation.\nThe continuous symmetries of the gauge theory are U(1)R \u00d7 U(1)B \u00d7 SO(4) where\nthe SO(4) acts on the A's and the B's as SU(2) \u00d7 SU(2). The exactly marginal\nsuperpotential is fixed uniquely by the symmetries up to overall normalization:\nW \u223c \u01ebij \u01ebkl tr Ai Bk Aj Bl .\n\n(2.5)\n\nThe U(1) baryon number symmetry acts as Ak \u2192 ei\u03b1 Ak , Bj \u2192 e\u2212i\u03b1 Bj . The massless\ngauge field in AdS5 dual to the baryon number current originates from the RR 4-form\npotential [21, 22]:\n\u03b4C4 \u223c \u03c93 \u2227 A .\n(2.6)\nAlso important for our discussion is the Z2 symmetry generated by the interchange\nof A1 , A2 with B1 , B2 accompanied by charge conjugation, i.e. the interchange of the\nfundamental and the antifundamental representations, in both SU(N) gauge groups\n[19, 20]. We will call this interchange symmetry the I symmetry. The corresponding\ntransformation in the IIB string theory on AdS5 \u00d7 T 1,1 is the interchange of (\u03b81 , \u03c61 )\nwith (\u03b82 , \u03c62) (i.e., of the two S2 's) accompanied by the \u2212I of the SL(2, Z) S-duality\nsymmetry [19, 20]. The action of the \u2212I of the SL(2, Z) reverses the sign of the NS-NS\nand R-R 2-form potentials, B2 and C2 .\nThe addition of M fractional 3-branes (wrapped D5-branes) at the singular point\nof the conifold changes the gauge group to SU(N + M) \u00d7 SU(N) [6]. The M units\n3\n\n\fof magnetic 3-form flux cause the conifold to make a \"geometric transition\" to the\ndeformed conifold\n4\nX\n\nza2 = \u01eb2 ,\n\n(2.7)\n\na=1\n\nin which the singularity of the conifold is removed through the blowing-up of the S3\nof T 1,1 . Therefore, the dual of the cascading SU(M(p + 1)) \u00d7 SU(Mp) gauge theory\nis the warped deformed conifold [5].

Further spontaneous breaking of this discrete symmetry to Z2 , which acts as\nzi \u2192 \u2212zi , does not lead to appearance of a Goldstone mode. The U(1)B symmetry is\nnot anomalous, and its spontaneous breaking does produce a Goldstone mode, which\nwe exhibit in section 3.\n\n3\n\nThe Goldstone mode\n\nTo begin, consider a D1-brane extended in two of the four dimensions in R3,1 . Because\nthe D1-brane carries electric charge under the R-R three-form field strength F3 , it is\nnatural to think that a pseudo-scalar a in four dimensions, defined so that \u22174 da = \u03b4F3 ,2\n\n2\nThe 4-dimensional Hodge dual \u22174 is calculated with the Minkowski metric, vol4 = dx0 \u2227 dx1 \u2227\ndx2 \u2227 dx3 .\n\n5\n\n\fexperiences monodromy as one loops around the D1-brane world-volume.\nThe perturbation ansatz we therefore adopt is\n\u03b4F3 = \u22174 da + f2 (\u03c4 )da \u2227 dg 5 + f2\u2032 da \u2227 d\u03c4 \u2227 g 5 ,\n\u01eb4/3\n\u03b4F5 = (1 + \u2217)\u03b4F3 \u2227 B2 = (\u22174 da \u2212\nh(\u03c4 )da \u2227 d\u03c4 \u2227 g 5) \u2227 B2 ,\n2\n6K (\u03c4 )\n\n(3.18)\n\nwhere f2\u2032 = df2/d\u03c4 , h(\u03c4 ) is given by (2.13), and K(\u03c4 ) by (2.12). The variations of all\nother fields, including the metric and the dilaton, vanish. The last two terms in \u03b4F3\nsum to the exact form \u2212d(f2 da \u2227 g 5 ). As shown in [1], all linearized SUGRA equations\nare satisfied if a(x0 , x1 , x2 , x3 ) is a harmonic function, i.e. d\u22174 da = 0, and f2 (\u03c4 ) satisfies\nd\n8\n(gs M\u03b1\u2032 )2\n\u03c4\n\u2212 [K 4 sinh2 \u03c4 f2\u2032 ] +\nf\n=\n(\u03c4 coth \u03c4 \u2212 1) coth \u03c4 \u2212\n2\n2\n4/3\nd\u03c4\n9K\n3\u01eb\nsinh2 \u03c4\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(3.19)\n\nThe normalizable solution of (3.19) that is regular both for small and for large \u03c4 is\n2c\nf2 (\u03c4 ) = \u2212 2\nK sinh2 \u03c4\n\nZ\n\n\u03c4\n0\n\ndx h(x) sinh2 x ,\n\n(3.20)\n\nwhere c \u223c \u01eb4/3 .

The form of the \u03b4F5 in (3.18) makes the connection\nbetween our zero-mode and U(1)B evident. Asymptotically, at large \u03c4 , there is a\ncomponent \u223c \u03c93 \u2227 da \u2227 d\u03c4 in \u03b4F5 . Thus from (2.6), we have A \u223c da. For the 4-d\neffective Lagrangian, there should be a coupling between the baryon number current\nJ \u03bc and a:\n1 Z 4 \u03bc\n1 Z 4\nd xJ \u2202\u03bc a = \u2212\nd x a(x)(\u2202\u03bc J \u03bc ) ,\n(3.21)\nfa\nfa\nwhere the pseudo-scalar a enters as the parameter of the baryon number transformation. It is important that this transformation does not leave the vacuum invariant!\nAs discussed in [5, 9] the field theory is on the baryonic branch: \"the last step\"\nof the cascade takes place through giving expectation values to baryonic operators in\nthe SU(2M) \u00d7 SU(M) gauge theory coupled to bifundamental fields Ai , Bj , i, j = 1, 2.\nIn addition to mesonic operators (Nij )\u03b1\u03b2 \u223c (Ai Bj )\u03b1\u03b2 , the gauge theory has baryonic\noperators invariant under the SU(2M) \u00d7 SU(M) gauge symmetry:\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b1\n\nB \u223c \u01eb\u03b11 \u03b12 ...\u03b12M (A1 )\u03b11 1 (A1 )\u03b12 2 . . .

These operators contribute an additional term to the usual mesonic\nsuperpotential:\nW = \u03bb(Nij )\u03b1\u03b2 (Nkl )\u03b2\u03b1 \u01ebik \u01ebjl + X(det[(Nij )\u03b1\u03b2 ] \u2212 BB\u0304 \u2212 \u039b4M\n2M ) ,\n\n(3.23)\n\nwhere X can be understood as a Lagrange multiplier.\nThe supersymmetry-preserving vacua include the baryonic branch:\nX =0; N =0;\n\nBB\u0304 = \u2212\u039b4M\n2M ,\n\n(3.24)\n\nwhere the SO(4) global symmetry rotating Ai , Bj is unbroken. Since the supergravity\nbackground of [5] also has this symmetry, it is natural to identify the dual of this\nbackground with the baryonic branch of the cascading theory. The expectation values\nof the baryonic operators spontaneously break the U(1) baryon number symmetry\nAk \u2192 ei\u03b1 Ak , Bj \u2192 e\u2212i\u03b1 Bj . The deformed conifold as described in [5] corresponds to a\nvacuum where |B| = |B\u0304| = \u039b2M\n2M , which is invariant under the exchange of the A's with\nthe B's accompanied by charge conjugation in both gauge groups. As noted in [9], the\nbaryonic branch has complex dimension 1, and it can be parametrized by \u03be where\ni\nB\u0304 = \u039b2M\n.\n\u03be 2M\n\nB = i\u03be\u039b2M\n2M ,\n\n(3.25)\n\nThe pseudo-scalar Goldstone mode must correspond to changing \u03be by a phase, since\nthis is precisely what a U(1)B symmetry transformation does. As usual, the gradient\nof the pseudo-scalar Goldstone mode fa \u2202\u03bc a is created from the vacuum by the action\nof the axial baryon number current, J\u03bc (we expect that the scale of the dimensionful\n'decay constant' fa is determined by the baryon expectation values).\nThus, the breaking of the U(1) baryon number symmetry necessitates the presence\nof a massless pseudo-scalar glueball, which we have found. By supersymmetry, this\nfield falls into a massless N = 1 chiral multiplet. Hence, there will also be a massless\nscalar mode and corresponding Weyl fermion. The scalar must correspond to changing\n\u03be by a positive real factor.\n\n7\n\n\f4\n\nThe Scalar Zero-Mode\n\nThe presence of the pseudo-scalar zero mode found in section 3, and the N = 1\nsupersymmetry, require the existence of a scalar zero-mode. In this section we argue\nthat this zero-mode comes from a metric perturbation that mixes with the NS-NS\n2-form potential.\nThe warped deformed conifold of [5] preserves the Z2 interchange symmetry which\nwe called the I symmetry in section 2: see below (2.6). However, the pseudo-scalar\nmode we found breaks this symmetry: from the form of the perturbations (3.18) we\nsee that \u03b4F3 is even under the interchange of (\u03b81 , \u03c61 ) with (\u03b82 , \u03c62 ), while F3 is odd; \u03b4F5\nis odd while F5 is even. Similarly, the scalar mode must also break the I symmetry\nbecause in the field theory it breaks the symmetry between expectation values of |B|\nand of |B\u0304|. We expect that turning on the zero-momentum scalar modifies the geometry\nbecause the scalar changes the absolute value of |B| and |B\u0304| while the pseudo-scalar\naffects only the phase. The necessary perturbation that preserves the SO(4) but breaks\nthe I symmetry is a mixture of the NS-NS 2-form and the metric:\n\u03b4B2 = \u03c7(\u03c4 )dg 5 ,\n\n\u03b4G13 = \u03b4G24 = m(\u03c4 ) ,\n\n(4.26)\n\nwhere, for example, \u03b4G13 = m(\u03c4 ) means to add 2m(\u03c4 ) g (1 g 3) to ds210 . To see that these\ncomponents of the metric break the I symmetry, we note that\n(e1 )2 + (e2 )2 \u2212 (e3 )2 \u2212 (e4 )2 = g 1g 3 + g 3 g 1 + g 2 g 4 + g 4 g 2 .\n\n(4.27)\n\nWe find it convenient to define m(\u03c4 ) = h1/2 K sinh(\u03c4 ) z(\u03c4 ).\nIn [1] it was shown that all the linearized SUGRA equations are satisfied provided\nthat\n\u0010\n\n(K sinh(\u03c4 ))2 z \u2032\n(K sinh(\u03c4 ))2\n\n\u0011\u2032\n\n=\n\n!\n\n8\n1\n4 cosh(\u03c4 )\n2\n+\n\u2212\nz\n2\n6\n2\nsinh(\u03c4 )\n9 K sinh(\u03c4 )\n3 K 3 sinh(\u03c4 )2\n\n(4.28)\n\nand\n\n1\nsinh(2\u03c4 ) \u2212 2\u03c4\n\u03c7\u2032 = gs Mz(\u03c4 )\n.\n2\nsinh2 \u03c4\nThe solution of (4.28) for the zero-mode is remarkably simple:\nz(\u03c4 ) = s\n\n(\u03c4 coth(\u03c4 ) \u2212 1)\n,\n[sinh(2\u03c4 ) \u2212 2\u03c4 ]1/3\n8\n\n(4.29)\n\n(4.30)\n\n\fwith s a constant. Like the pseudo-scalar perturbation, the large \u03c4 asymptotic is\nagain z \u223c \u03c4 e\u22122\u03c4 /3 . We note that the metric perturbation also has the simple form\n\u03b4G13 \u223c h1/2 [\u03c4 coth(\u03c4 ) \u2212 1]. Note that the perturbed metric ds\u030362 differs from the metric\nof the deformed conifold, eq. (2.9), by\n\u223c (\u03c4 coth \u03c4 \u2212 1)(g 1 g 3 + g 3 g 1 + g 2 g 4 + g 4g 2 ) ,\n\n(4.31)\n\nwhich grows as ln r in the asymptotic radial variable r.\nThe existence of the scalar zero-mode makes it likely that there is a one-parameter\nfamily of supersymmetric solutions which break the I symmetry but preserve the SO(4)\n(an ansatz with these properties was found in [11], and its linearization agrees with\n(4.26)). We will call these conjectured backgrounds resolved warped deformed\nconifolds. We add the word resolved because both the resolution of the conifold,\nwhich is a Kaehler deformation, and these resolved warped deformed conifolds break\nthe I symmetry. As we explained in section 3, in the dual gauge theory turning on\nthe I breaking corresponds to the transformation B \u2192 (1 + s)B, B\u0304 \u2192 (1 + s)\u22121 B\u0304 on\nthe baryonic branch. Therefore, s is dual to the I breaking parameter of the resolved\nwarped deformed conifold.\nOne might ask whether the resolved warped deformed conifolds are still of the form\n\u22121/2\nh\ndx2|| + h1/2 ds\u030326 where ds\u030326 is Ricci flat. At linear order in our perturbation, our\nconifold metric ds\u030326 is indeed Ricci flat: the first order corrections vanish if (4.28) is\nsatisfied. We also showed [1] that the complex 3-form field strength G3 = F3 \u2212 gis H3\nremains imaginary self-dual at linear order, i.e. \u22176 G3 = iG3 . It will be interesting to\nsee if these properties continue to hold for the exact solution.\n\n5\n\nCompactification and Higgs Mechanism\n\nAs we argued above, the non-compact warped deformed conifold exhibits a supergravity\ndual of the Goldstone mechanism. It was crucial for our arguments that the U(1)B\nsymmetry is not gauged in the field theory, and the appearance of the Goldstone boson\nin the supergravity dual confirms that the symmetry is global.\nIf the warped deformed conifold is embedded into a flux compactification of type\nIIB string on a 6-dimensional CY manifold, then we expect the global U(1)B symmetry\nto become gauged, because the square of the gauge coupling becomes finite. In the\ncompact case we may write \u03b4C4 \u223c \u03c93 \u2227 A, where \u03c93 is harmonic in the full compact\n9\n\n\fcase and A is the 4-d gauge field. If we ignore subtleties with the self-duality of the\n5-form field strength, then the kinetic terms for it is\n1\n2gs2\n\nZ\n\n\u221a\nd10 x \u2212gF52 .\n\n(5.32)\n\nSubstituting F5 = F2 \u2227 \u03c93 and reducing to 4 dimensions, we find the U(1) kinetic term\n\nwhere\n\n1 Z 4 2\nd xF2 ,\n2g 2\n\n(5.33)\n\n1\n1\n\u223c 2 \u03c4m ,\n2\ng\ngs\n\n(5.34)\n\nwhere we assumed that the effect of compactification is to introduce a cut-off at \u03c4m \u226b 1.\nThe finiteness of the gauge coupling in the compact case means that the Goldstone\nmechanism should turn into a Higgs mechanism. The Goldstone boson a enters as a\ngauge parameter of A and gets absorbed by the U(1) gauge field to make a massive\nvector field. As usual in the supersymmetric Higgs mechanism, the scalar acquires the\nsame mass which originates from the D-term potential. In N = 1 notation, gauge\ninvariance means we have to introduce factors of e\u00b1gV into the D-terms for B and B:3\n\u2217\n\nB\u2217 egV B + B e\u2212gV B .\n\n(5.35)\n\nExpanding these D-terms to second order in g, we find\ng 2 (|B|2 + |B|2 )V 2 .\n\n(5.36)\n\nAs a result, we find an N = 1 massive vector supermultiplet containing a massive\nvector, a scalar (the Higgs boson), and their fermion superpartners.\nIn the preceding, we ignored the linear term in g:\ng(|B|2 \u2212 |B|2 + \u03b6)V ,\n\n(5.37)\n\nwhere we have included a Fayet-Iliopoulos parameter \u03b6. Depending on details of the\ncompactification, it may be that \u03b6 is nonzero. Then the potential for the scalar has\n3\n\nB and B have charge of order M , a charge which we have for simplicity neglected to include in\nthe coupling to V .\n\n10\n\n\fits minimum for |\u03be| =\n6 1, and the baryon VEVs in (3.25) are unequal in magnitude.\nIn other words, the Fayet-Iliopoulos parameter breaks the I symmetry. Thus, further\nstudy of the one-parameter family of the supersymmetric backgrounds dual to the\nbaryonic branch is of interest to the understanding of flux compactifications.\nWhile in the non-compact case D-strings are global strings, in the compact case they\nshould be interpreted as Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen vortices of an Abelian-Higgs model,\nwhere the charged chiral superfields breaking the gauge symmetry are the baryon operators B and B\u0304.4 Since there is a finite number K of NS-NS flux units through a cycle\ndual to the 3-sphere [14], the D-string charge takes values in ZK . Indeed, K D-strings\ncan break on a wrapped D3-brane [17]. Correspondingly, we do not expect the ANO\nvortex duals to be BPS saturated.\n\n6\n\nDiscussion\n\nOur work sheds new light on the physics of the cascading SU(M(p+1))\u00d7SU(Mp) gauge\ntheory, whose supergravity dual is the warped deformed conifold [5]. In the infrared\nthe theory is not in the same universality class as the pure glue N = 1 supersymmetric\nSU(M) theory: the cascading theory contains massless glueballs, as well as solitonic\nstrings dual to the D-strings placed at \u03c4 = 0 in the supergravity background.\nAs suggested in [5, 9] and reviewed in section 3 above, the infrared field theory\nis better thought of as SU(2M) \u00d7 SU(M) on the baryonic branch, i.e. with baryon\noperators (3.22) having expectation values. Since the global baryon number symmetry,\nU(1)B , is broken by these expectation values, the spectrum must contain a Goldstone\nbosons which we find explicitly. We also construct at linear order a Lorentz-invariant\ndeformation of the background which we argue is a zero-momentum state of the scalar\nsuperpartner of the Goldstone mode. Our calculations confirm the validity of the\nbaryonic branch interpretation of the gauge theory. This also resolves a puzzle about\nthe dual of the D-strings at \u03c4 = 0: they are the solitonic strings that couple to\nthese massless glueballs. We further argue that, upon embedding this theory in a\nwarped compactification, the global U(1)B symmetry becomes gauged; then the gauge\nsymmetry is broken by the baryon expectation values through a supersymmetric version\nof the Higgs mechanism. Thus, in a flux compactification, we expect the D-string to\nbe dual to an Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen vortex.\n4\nRepresentation of D-strings by ANO vortices in low-energy supergravity was recently advocated\nin a different context [25] (see also earlier work by [26]).\n\n11\n\n\fIn [5] it was argued that there is a limit, gs M \u2192 0, 5 where the physics of the\ncascading gauge theory should approach that of the pure glue N = 1 supersymmetric\nSU(M) gauge theory. How can this statement be consistent with the presence of\nthe Goldstone bosons? We believe that it can. Returning to the SU(2M) \u00d7 SU(M)\ngauge theory discussed in section 4, we expect that in the limit gs M \u2192 0 the scale\n\u039b2M of the SU(2M), i.e. that of the baryon condensates, is much higher than the\nscale \u039bM of the SU(M). Hence, the decay constant fa should be much greater than\nthe confinement scale \u039bM . Since the Goldstone boson interactions at the confinement\nscale are suppressed by powers of \u039bM /fa , they appear to decouple from the massive\nglueballs containing the physics of the pure glue supersymmetric SU(M) gauge theory.\nObviously, this heuristic argument needs to be subjected to various checks.\nOur work opens new directions for future research. Turning on finite scalar perturbations is expected to give rise to a new class of Lorentz invariant supersymmetric\nbackgrounds, the resolved warped deformed conifolds, which preserve the SO(4)\nglobal symmetry but break the discrete I symmetry of the warped deformed conifold.\nThe ansatz for such backgrounds was proposed in [11]. We have argued that these conjectured backgrounds are dual to the cascading gauge theory on the baryonic branch.\nIt would be desirable to find them explicitly, and to confirm their supersymmetry.\nA more explicit construction of the solitonic string in the gauge theory is desirable. It is also interesting to explore the consequences of our results for cosmological\nmodeling.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe are grateful to D. Berenstein, J. Maldacena, J. Polchinski, A. Polyakov, R.
