Introduction\nThe systematic study of charged particle multiplicity in Au+Au collisions at center\n\u221a\nof mass energies sNN = 130 GeV and 200 GeV was conducted by all RHIC experiments in great detail [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. These studies were accompanied by\nintensive theoretical work successfully connecting the produced particle densities\nwith the initial conditions in these collisions. Essentially all models that attempt to\ndescribe the evolution of matter produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions predict\na strong correlation between the average transverse momentum and the multiplicity\n2\nof the event, typically hpT i \u221d dNch /d\u03b7. This simply reflects the basic thermodynamic concept inherent to the models: large Nch means large entropy, large entropy\nmeans higher temperature T , which, following the general concepts of Landau's\nhydrodynamical model, implies an increase in hpT i. The use of thermodynamics\nin this argument does not, of course, preclude a dynamical description in terms of\n(non-)perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). It simply takes advantage\nof the fact that if the actual physical states of the system are close to a canoni-\n\n\f2\n\nT.S.Ullrich\n\ncal distribution, thermodynamics is an ideal tool to analyze the measurements and\nrelate them to bulk properties of hot matter.\nOne prominent class of models that allows a direct coupling of global observables with the initial conditions of the collision are those based on the concept of\ngluon saturation. In these models particle production is related to the initial gluon\ndistribution. A semi-classic calculation can be carried out due to the high gluon\ndensity, a saturation phenomenon also known as the Color Glass Condensate [ 7, 8].\nThe only scale that controls the gluon distribution at a given Bjorken x is the saturation momentum scale Qs . If the gluons realize themselves directly to hadrons,\nthe transverse momentum of the hadrons will be directly related to the saturation\nscale Qs as well as the multiplicity of the particle production[ 8, 9]. In fact, this\nassumption was used in some predictions that successfully predicted the particle\nmultiplicity along with their centrality and pseudorapidity dependence [ 8].\nSo far, however, only few studies were undertaken to verify if these models are\nalso able to describe the characteristics of hpT i at RHIC. In this article we present\nresults on the characteristics of (i) the charged particle densities and (ii) of hpT i\nusing data recorded by the STAR experiment.\n\n2. Inclusive charged hadron spectra\nThe data reported here were taken with the Solenoidal Tracker at RHIC (STAR) [\n10]. The main tracking device in STAR is a large Time Projection Chamber (TPC)\nwhich provides momentum information and particle identification for charged particles by measuring their ionization energy loss. A Central Trigger Barrel (CTB) constructed of scintillator paddles surrounding the TPC and two Zero Degree Calorimeters (ZDC) were used for triggering. Data were taken for Au+Au collisions at\n\u221a\n\u221a\nsNN =130 GeV in the summer of 2000 (run I) and sNN =200 GeV in the fall of\n2001 (run II). The field setting for run I was at 0.25 T while at run II it was at\nthe nominal field setting of 0.5 T. The increased field resulted in a factor of three\nimprovement in momentum resolution. In both runs a minimum bias trigger was\ndefined by using coincidences between the two ZDCs located \u00b118 meters away from\nthe interaction point. For details see Ref. [ 11].\nTo measure the differential invariant cross-section of the produced charged particle for different centralities tracks with transverse momenta between 0.2 and 2.0\nGeV/c were selected. The reconstruction efficiency was determined by embedding\nsimulated tracks into real events at the raw data level, reconstructing the full events,\nand comparing the simulated input to the reconstructed output. Charged hadrons\n(h+ + h\u2212 )/2 were approximated by the summed yields of \u03c0 \u00b1 , K \u00b1 , p and p\u0304. The\nefficiencies for the identified particles are between 70% and 80% for central events\nat pT > 0.5 GeV/c. At lower pT (0.2 to 0.5 GeV/c), the efficiency for pion is\nabout 70% and the efficiencies of kaon and antiproton are from 30% to about 70%\ndue to energy loss, absorption and decay in the detector. The final efficiency of the\ncharged particle spectrum is the weighted efficiency of all \u03c0 \u00b1 , K \u00b1 and p\u00b1 according\n\n\fSTAR\nAu+Au (130 GeV)\n|\u03b7|<0.5\n\n3\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n10\n\n0\n\n/2 0 - 5%\n/2 1 5 - 10%\n/2 2 10 - 20%\n\n1\n-1\n\n3\n-2\ndN\n(GeV/c)\n2\u03c0 p Tdp Td \u03b7\n\n-2\ndN\n(GeV/c)\np Tdp Td \u03b7\n\nCharacteristics of Nch and hpT i\nh++ h-----------2\n\n4\n\n10\n\nSTAR preliminary\nAu+Au (200GeV)\n|\u03b7|<0.5\n\n3\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n/2 3 20 - 30%\n\n10\n\n/2 4 30 - 40%\n-2\n\n/2 5 40 - 50%\n\n10\n\n10\n\n/2 6 50 - 60%\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n/2 7 60 - 70%\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n-5\n\nh++ h-----------2\n\n10\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n/2\n\n8\n\n70 - 80%\n\n/2\n\n9\n\n80 - 100%\n\n2.5\n3\np T (GeV/c)\n\n1\n\n0-5%, \u00d7 4\n5-10%, \u00d7 2\n10-20%\n20-30%\n30-40%\n40-60%\n60-80%\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\n2\n\np (GeV/c)\n\u221a\nFig. 1.

It is almost identical to that of the pions for all pT .\nBackground particles mis-identified as primary particles originate from various\nsources. The dominant ones are: hadrons from weak decays of KS0 , \u039b and \u039b\u0304, weak\ndecays of primary charged particles, and hadrons from secondary interactions in\nthe detectors. The background corrections for the former were calculated by using\nmeasured yields and spectra. The later two are important only at low pT and\nwe used HIJING with a detailed detector simulation to reproduce the background\nspectra for each centrality.\nFigure 1 shows the fully corrected inclusive pT distributions of primary charged\n\u221a\nparticles for sNN =130 and 200 GeV Au+Au collisions for 10 and 7 centrality\nbins, respectively. The spectra were fit with a power law function of the form\nA(1 + pT /p0 )n . The average momentum is defined as hpT i = 2 p0 /(n \u2212 3). To\nextract the hpT i we substitute p0 by hpT i(n \u2212 3)/2 and fit the spectrum with hpT i\nand n as a free parameters. The difference between the integral of the fit function\nand the sum of the data points in the fiducial kinematic range is less than 1%.\nThe extrapolation to the total pT is 21-26% from central to peripheral centrality.\nThe systematical uncertainty of hpT i was estimated to 2%. The function, fit in\nthe range of 0.2 GeV/c to 2.0 GeV/c, was then extrapolated to the full transverse\nmomentum range to get the total Nch . The systematical uncertainty on Nch is 7%.\n\u221a\nFor the 5% most central collisions. The charged hadron multiplicity at sNN =200\nGeV (130 GeV) is dNch /d\u03b7||\u03b7|<0.5 = 690 \u00b1 55(syst) (579 \u00b1 60(syst)) and the\nmean transverse momentum hpT i is 0.517 \u00b1 0.012GeV/c (0.519 \u00b1 0.01GeV/c). For\n\u221a\nsNN =200 GeV the multiplicity per participant pair increases by 38% relative to\n\u221a\npp\u0304 and 52% compared to nuclear collisions at sNN =17 GeV. The hpT i increases\nby 32% and 20% respectively from 0.392 GeV/c in pp\u0304 collisions and \u2243 0.429 GeV/c\nin Pb+Pb collisions at SPS [ 11, 12].\n\n+\n\n\u2212\n\nT\n\n\f4\n\nT.S.Ullrich\n\n3. Centrality dependence of charged particle densities\nThe RHIC experiments all have different methods of determining centrality. In\ngeneral, all measure some final state variable (or combination of these variables)\nthat can be related to fractions of the total measured hadronic cross-section. These\ncentrality bins are then mapped to variables that allow for direct comparison between experiments. The primary variables that are used for comparison are (i) the\nnumber of participating nucleons in the collision Npart and (ii) the number of binary collisions Nbin , which are determined via the application of the Glauber model\nphenomenology. The basic concept of the Glauber model is to treat a Au+Au collision as a superposition of many independent nucleon-nucleon (N+N) collisions.\nThus, the only parameters that the model depends on are a nuclear density profile\n(Woods-Saxon) and the non-diffractive inelastic N+N cross-section. The former is\nwell measured in e+Au scattering experiments. The latter is well established by\nmany previous experiments. With this, it is possible to determine both the total\nnumber of independent N+N collisions (Nbin ) and the total number of nucleons\nthat participate in the collisions (Npart ) as a function of impact parameter (b).\nThere are two separate implementations of the Glauber model: Optical and Monte\nCarlo. In the optical formalism Nbin and Npart are directly determined by an analytic integration of overlapping Woods-Saxon distributions. In the M.C. method\nan arbitrary number of events are simulated using a computer program and the\nresulting distributions of Nbin and Npart are determined. Once the distributions\nd\u03c3/dNpart and d\u03c3/dNbin are determined, these histograms are binned according to\nfractions of the total cross-section. This determines the mean values of Nbin and\nNpart for each centrality class. In this context it should be noted that in the M.C.\napproach one requires that all nucleons in either nucleus be separated by a distance\nd \u2265 dmin where dmin = 0.4 fm is characteristic of the length of the repulsive nucleonnucleon force. Consequently the total Au+Au cross section predicted by the Monte\nCarlo approach depends strongly on dmin . A value of dmin = 0.4 fm yields a total\ncross-section of 7.2 barns, while dmin = 0 fm yields 6.8 barns.\nWhile at SPS energies both approaches yielded consistent answers, at RHIC\nenergies, the optical approach may yield systematically smaller values of the total\nAu+Au cross-section. Therefore, any results reported in terms of Glauber quantities\nmust be carefully interpreted based upon specifics of the Glauber calculations.\nIn the case of STAR the centrality was determined by the multiplicity of all\ncharged particles within |\u03b7| < 0.5 and then expressed in terms of the fractional total\nhadronic cross section. The measured data, i.e. the dN/dNch distributions, are\nthen mapped to the corresponding distribution obtained from Glauber calculations\nas described above, thus relating Npart and Nbin to the measured distributions.\nFigure 2 shows the extracted yields as the pseudo-rapidity density per participant pair 2/Npart dN/d\u03b7 versus the number of participants Npart for Au+Au\n\u221a\ncollisions at sNN =130 GeV, where for the left plot we used a Monte Carlo Glauber\ncalculation to derive Npart while for the right plot we used an optical Glauber model.\nThe parameterization of pseudo-rapidity density of the EKRT model [ 13], a\n\n\fdN ch\n2\n<Npart > d\u03b7\n\nCharacteristics of Nch and hpT i\n\n5\nKharzeev Nardi:\nnpp =2.25 x=0.12 \u00b10.018\nEKRT\nC=0.82 \u00b10.03 a=0.92 \u00b10.00 s=0.40 \u00b10.00\nA+B*<N part >\n\nKharzeev Nardi:\nnpp =2.25 x=0.08 \u00b10.010\nEKRT\nC=0.73 \u00b10.02 a=0.92 \u00b10.00 s=0.40 \u00b10.00\nA+B*<N part >\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\nSTAR Preliminary\n0\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n+\n\nh++ h-\n\nh+\nh\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\nh++ h-\n\nh\nh0\n\n<Npart >MC-Glauber\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\n<Npart >Optical\n\nFig. 2.

On the left plot Npart was calculated using a MC\nGlauber approach while on the right plot an optical Glauber model was used.\nmodel based on the assumption of final state gluon saturation, fails to describe the\ndata when using the Monte Carlo Glauber calculations, but agrees nicely with when\nusing the optical Glauber calculation. Both, our data and the EKRT parameterization do not approach the charged particle pseudo-rapidity density npp = 2.25\n(measured from non-single diffractive pp\u0304 interactions and parameterized as npp =\n2.5 \u00b1 1.0 \u2212 (0.25 \u00b1 0.19) ln(s) + (0.023 \u00b1 0.008) ln2 (s) [ 14]) in the limit of Npart =2.\nOne might argue that the model breaks down for very peripheral collisions. The\ncentrality dependence from mid-central to central collisions is in fact too weak to\nrule out the EKRT model.\nComparing the two-component model described in Ref. [ 15] with our data\nshows the exact opposite behavior. Fitting the proposed function to our data we\nfind agreement between the fit and our measurement only when using the Monte\nCarlo Glauber calculation (left plot in Fig. 2). Here, we evaluate the fraction of hard\ncollisions xhard as 0.08 \u00b1 0.01 for our most central events. The fraction of produced\nparticles originating from hard collisions is then calculated as Fhard = x npp Nbin/\n(dNch /d\u03b7) = 0.36 \u00b1 0.2. Both values xhard and Fhard agree nicely with the numbers\nquoted by Ref. [ 4] and [ 15].\nIt should be noted that in general the M.C. Glauber method is considered to\nbe more accurate than the calculations in the optical limit. Nevertheless, in both\napproaches the systematic uncertainties in the calculation of Npart are considerable\nlarge for very peripheral collisions, the region where the differences between the\nvarious models become more apparent. For the centrality fraction of 70-80% the\nuncertainty on Npart already reaches 30%.\n\n\f6\n\nT.S.Ullrich\n\n4.

The open diamonds are measurements from the PHOBOS\nCollaboration [ 3]. For central collisions the charged particle multiplicity increases\nfrom 130 GeV to 200 GeV by 19%. This result is comparable with the results from\nother RHIC experiments [ 3]. However, the systematical uncertainty at peripheral\ncollisions is too large to be conclusive as shown in the top panel. Surprisingly, one\nfinds no increase of hpT i within the current systematic errors for any centrality bin\nas depicted in the bottom panel.\nFigure 5 shows hpT i of negatively charged particles h\u2212 from NA49 and charged\n\u221a\nparticles (h+ + h\u2212 )/2 from various other experiments as function of sNN for pp, p\u0304p\nand central AA collisions. The dotted line is a parametrization of the measured hpT i\nin pp collisions [ 16]. For the e+ e\u2212 data, the dot-dashed line is a prediction from\nJETSET [ 17]. The fact that the hpT i from AA collisions is distinctly different from\nboth pp and e+ e\u2212 indicates that AA collisions are not simple superpositions of the\nelementary collisions.\nAs already discussed in the introduction, saturation [ 9] and hydrodynamical [\n2\n2\n18] models predict some scaling behavior of hpT i \u223c ( dN\nd\u03b7 )AA /\u03c0R .\nIn order to get a quantitative analysis on the dependence between hpT i and\n\n\f\u3008pT\u3009 (GeV/c)\n\n7\n\n]\n\n2\n[]\n\n1.8\n1.6\n\ne +e 0.55\n\nSTAR\n0.5\n\n[ ]\n\n[ ]\n\n0.45\n\nNA49\nCDF\nE735\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n1.2\n1\n\n[ ]\n\n]\n\n]\n\n1.4\n\nSTAR preliminary\nsys err (geometry)\n\n0.6\n\nPHOBOS\n\n]\n\nratio(200/130)\n\nCharacteristics of Nch and hpT i\n\nNch Ratio\n\n0.8\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\nUA1\n\n1.05\n\n0.35\n\n1\n0.9\n\nISR\n\npT Ratio\n\n0.95\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\nSTAR preliminary\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\nNpart\n\n0.3\n\n102\n\n103\n\n\u221as (GeV)\n\nFig. 4.

Thereby, there is only one free parameter as shown in Eq. 1:\nr\nsAA\n(hpT ipp \u2212 a);\n(1)\nhpT iAA = a +\nspp\nwhere sAA = (dN /d\u03b7)AA /\u03c0R2 and spp = (dN /d\u03b7)pp /\u03c0r02 are the multiplicity densities per unit pseudorapidity per unit transverse area in AA and pp collisions(R =\nr0 A1/3 ) and a = 0.3 GeV/c is a constant chosen to describe the AA data. For\nnon-central collisions, the calculation of the transverse area is not straight forward.\nWe take the centrality dependence parametrization of sAA from Ref. [ 9]. The solid\ncurves in Fig. 3 and Fig. 5 show the energy dependence and centrality dependence\nof hpT i from Eq. 1. The curves describe the data well from SPS to RHIC at 130\n\u221a\nGeV. However, the data show that the increase in hpT i from sNN = 130 to 200 GeV\nis not as strong as the thick-line indicates which may invalidate the scaling law from\nthe saturation model [ 9]. On the other hand, the energy dependence might indicate\nthe importance of early thermalization in the partonic stage, as proposed in ref [\n19]. Such initial partonic activity is consistent with the early development of flow\nas indicated from hv2 i measurements at RHIC [ 20]. It will be interesting to see if\nthe description holds with an energy scan of lower beam energies at RHIC.\n\n5. Summary\nIn summary, STAR has measured charged particle multiplicities and transverse\n\u221a\nmomentum spectra at mid rapidity in Au+Au collisions at sNN =130 GeV and\n200 GeV. Their centrality and beam energy dependences are distinctly different\n\n\f8\n\nT.S.Ullrich\n\nfrom elementary collisions (e+ e\u2212 , pp and p\u0304p). The saturation model with direct\nhadron production from gluons seems unable to explain the lack of increase in hpT i\nfrom 130 GeV to 200 GeV. However, the saturation model with thermalization [\n19] might be consistent with our result. Further measurements with various beam\nenergies and beam species such as d+Au may be able to further distinguish different\nproduction mechanisms.\n\nAcknowledgment\nThe author thanks F. Laue, M.
