We prove the closure for the sequential weak Lp topology of the class of vectorfields on B 3 having integer flux\nthrough almost every sphere. We show how this problem is connected to the study of the minimization problem for the Yang-Mills\nfunctional in dimension higher than critical, in the abelian case.\n\n1. Introduction\nIn this work we consider the class LpZ (B 3 , R3 ) of vectorfields X \u2208\nLp (B 3 , R3 ) such that\nZ\nX * \u03bd \u2208 Z, \u2200a \u2208 B 3 , a.e. r < dist(a, \u2202B 3 ),\n\u2202Br3 (a)\n\nwhere \u03bd : \u2202Br3 (a) \u2192 S 2 is the outward unit normal vector.\nWe observe that for p \u2265 3/2 this class reduces to the divergencefree vectorfields, and therefore we reduce o the \"interesting\" case p \u2208\n[1, 3/2[. It is clear that this class of vectorfields is closed by strong\nLp -convergence (see Lemma 2.5). We are interested in the closedness\nproperties of LpZ (B 3 , R3 ) for the sequential weak-Lp topology, and our\nmain result in the present work is the following:\nTheorem 1.1. For 1 < p < 3/2 the class LpZ (B 3 , R3 ) is weakly sequentially closed. More precisely, whenever\nXk \u2208 LpZ (B 3 , R3 ),\n\nXk\n\nweak-Lp\n\n\u21c0\n\nX\u221e ,\n\nthen X\u221e \u2208 LpZ (B 3 , R3 ).\nFor p = 1 given any vector-valued Radon measure X \u2208 M3 (B 3 )\nwhere\nM3 (B 3 ) := {(\u03bc1 , \u03bc2 , \u03bc3)| \u03bci signed Radon measure on B 3 },\nwe can find a sequence Xk \u2208 L1Z (B 3 , R3 ) such that Xk \u21c0 X weakly in\nthe sense of measures.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nMIRCEA PETRACHE,TRISTAN RIVI\u00c8RE\n\n2. Motivation: Yang-Mills theory in supercritical\ndimension\nIn this section we show how theorem 1.1 can be used in the framework\nof Yang-Mills theory. Consider a principal G-bundle \u03c0 : P \u2192 M\nover a compact Riemannian manifold M , and call A(P ) the space\nof smooth connections on P . The celebrated Yang-Mills functional\nY M : A \u2192 R+ \u222a{\u221e} is then defined as the L2 -energy of the curvature\nFA of A:\nZ\nY M(A) :=\n|FA |2 d V olg .\nM\n\nCritical points of this functional are connections satisfying in a weak\nsense the Yang-Mills equations, which have been extensively studied in\nthe conformal dimension 4, due to the geometric invariants that they\nhelp define (see [DK90, FU91]). We will focus here on the study of the\nfunctional Y M from a variational viewpoint. We will just consider the\ntwo simplest and most celebrated cases G = SU(2) (nonabelian case)\nand G = U(1) (abelian case).\n\n2.0.1. The smooth class. We first observe that since the Yang-Mills\nequations could have singularities, it is not clear if the infimum\ninf Y M(A)\n\n\u221e \u220bA\nC\u03c6\n\n(the subscript \"\u03c6\" means that we are fixing a smooth boundary datum \u03c6) is attained. The \"natural\" way to extend the class where Y M\nis defined, would then be to allow more general L2 -curvatures. Since\nFA = dA + A \u2227 A, we would have to consider therefore W 1,2 -regular\nconnections, and W 2,2 -change of gauge functions (for a detailed description of the theory of Sobolev principal bundles see for example\n[Weh04, Kes08, Iso09]).\nRemark 2.1. The fact that by the usual Sobolev embedding theorem\nW 2,2 \u0592\u2192 C 0 only when the dimension of the domain is < 4 implies\nthat the topology of the bundles which we consider is fixed just in low\ndimension. We therefore call n = 4 the critical dimension in the study\nof the functional Y M .\n2.1. A parallel between the study of harmonic maps u : B 3 \u2192\nS 2 and that of Y M in dimension 5. The most celebrated problem\nin which the study of singularities in a variational setting was introduced, is the minimization of the Dirichlet energy\nZ\nE(u) :=\n|\u2207u|2dx for u : B 3 \u2192 S 2 with u|\u2202B3 = \u03c6.\nB3\n\n\fSINGULAR Lp -BUNDLES\n\n3\n\nAs above, the infimum\ninf\n\n\u221e (B 3 ,S 2 )\nC\u03c6\n\nE\n\nis in general not achieved, and in this case the natural space to look\nat would be the space of functions having one weak derivative in L2 ,\nnamely W 1,2 (B 3 , S 2 ). We observe that for the functional E the critical\ndimension would then be 2, since W 1,2 (B n , S 2 ) \u0592\u2192 C 0 just for n <\n2. The optimal result achieved in this case is Theorem 2.2 below.\nSuch a regularity result would be the main goal in the study of the\nfunctional Y M in dimension higher than critical (but we will see that\nextra difficulties arise when we deal with singular curvatures).\nTheorem 2.2 ([SU82]). Given a smooth map \u03c6 \u2208 C \u221e (S 2 , S 2 ), for\nany minimizer u of E in W\u03c61,2 (B 3 , S 2 ) there exist finitely many points\na1 , . . . , aN \u2208 B 3 and numbers d1 , . . . , dN = \u00b11 such that\nu \u2208 C \u221e (B 3 \\ {a1 , . . . , aN }, S 2),\ndeg(u, ai ) = di for all i.\nThe singularities around which u realizes a nonzero integer degree\nas above 1 are called topological singularities.\nIf we want to consider an analogous topological obstructions for connections on bundles, we must start from the celebrated Chern-Weil\ntheory [Zha01], which describes topological invariants of bundles via\ncharacteristic classes represented in terms of curvatures of connections.\nThe most prominent \"topological singularity\" notion arising in relation\nto Yang-Mills SU(2)-gauge theory in dimension 4 is encoded into the\nsecond Chern class of the associated bundle. This homology class can\nbe represented using the curvature of a smooth connection A via the\nChern-Weil formula\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\nc2 (P ) = \u2212 2 tr(FA \u2227 FA ) .\n8\u03c0\nIn [Uhl85] it was proved that (in dimension 4) under a boundedness\ncondition on the L2 norm of the curvature, we have c2 (P ) \u2208 Z. Such\nintegrality condition has a role which is analogous to the one played\nby the integrality of the degree of maps g : S 2 \u2192 S 2 in the study\nof harmonic maps in W 1,2 (B 3 , S 2), and as such is useful to study the\nY M functional in dimension 5. More precisely, the strategy [KR08,\nKes08] consists in introducing the analogous of the space of maps with\n1The\n\nrealization of a degree around a point is a local topological obstruction for\nthe strong approximability in W 1,2 -norm [Bet90, BCDH91]. Global obstructions\nalso play a role in approximability properties [HL03].\n\n\f4\n\nMIRCEA PETRACHE,TRISTAN RIVI\u00c8RE\n\ntopological singularities described in Theorem 2.2. This time one has\nto consider smooth bundles defined on the base manifold with some\nfinite set of points removed\n\u001a\n\u001b\nprincipal SU(2)-bundles of the form\nP :=\n,\nP \u2192 M \\ \u03a3, for some finite set \u03a3 \u2282 M\nand then take the curvaturs of smooth connections on these bundles,\nrealizing integral Chern numbers on small spheres surrounding the singularities:\n\u001a\n\u001b\nA is a smooth connection on some P \u2208 P,\n\u221e\nR := FA\n.\nc2 (P |\u2202B(x,\u03b5) ) \u2208 Z \\ {0} for x \u2208 \u03a3, \u2200\u03b5 < dist(x, \u2202B \u222a \u03a3)\nMotivated by the above analogy, we can say that the above class R\u221e\nshould be contained in any candidate for a class of critical points of\nY M in dimension 5, as already noted in [Kes08, KR08]. If instead of\nconsidering the whole R\u221e , we fix the number, degree and position of\nthe singularities, a gap phenomenon arises, in analogy to [BCL86], as\ndescribed in [Iso98, Iso08].\n2.2. The basic difficulty: singularities of bundles. What is it\nthat forbids to continue the analogy with harmonic maps, and to prove\na regularity result like Theorem 2.2 for Y M in dimension 5? To answer\nthis question, we recall the two main ingredients without which such a\nresult is not possible:\n(A) A good variational setting, i.e. the presence of a class which\ncontains the maps with topological singularities and in which a\nminimizing sequence of E has a converging subsequence. It is\nshown in [Bet91, Bet90] that for harmonic maps, this class is\nW 1,2 with the sequaential weak topology, indeed\nC\u03c6\u221e (B 3 , S 2 ) is weakly sequentially dense in W 1,2 (B 3 , S 2 ),\nand the wanted compactness property is a consequence of the\nBanach-Alaoglu theorem. In W 1,2(B 3 , S 2 ) therefore, the existence of a minimizer for E with fixed boundary datum is clear,\nand therefore the existence of weak solutions for the equation\nof critical points of E is established.\n(B) An \u03b5-regularity theorem, i.e. the implication\nE(u) \u2264 \u03b5 on B1 and u is a minimizer of E\n\u21d2\nu is H\u00f6lder on B1/2 .\n\n\fSINGULAR Lp -BUNDLES\n\n5\n\nThis kind of result is used to prove the discreteness of the singularity set, which is the main difficulty in the proof of Theorem\n2.2.\nWe see that already the ingredient (A) (which is needed in order to\nformulate (B)) is problematic in the case of the Y M functional on\nbundles, since nothing shows that a priori the singularities of a minimizer should not accumlate, and it is not clear how to define a bundle\nwith accumulating topological singularities, at least if we stick to the\ndifferential-geometric definition of a bundle. We can formulate the following general problem:\nOpen Problem 1 (Right variational setting for the Yang-Mills theory\nin dimension 5). Find a topological space\n(1) which includes the class R\u221e of curvatures with finitely many\nsingularities\n(2) in which minimizing sequences for Y M are compact.\nThe natural candidate for a space solving the above problem in\nthe nonabelian case is the space of L2 -curvatures on singular SU(2)bundles defined in [KR08], Definition III.2. Such class clearly contains\nR\u221e ; Open Problem 1 is then equivalent to asking to find a suitable\ntopology on this natural class such that minimizing sequences for Y M\nare compact. Not only is the above problem still open, but it is not\nknown whether for all smooth boundary data the infimum of Y M is\nachieved, even in the class of L2 -curvatures of [KR08].\n2.3. Main Result. In this work we obtain the good setting described\nabove (thereby solving Open Problem 1), in the simpler case of abelian\nbundles, i.e. bundles with gauge group U(1).\nSmooth principal U(1)-bundles on a 2-manifold \u03a3 correspond to\nhermitian complex line bundles, and are classified by the integer given\n(see [MS74] for example) by the first Chern class, again expressable via\nthe Chern-Weil theory by\nZ\n1\nFA .\nc1 (P ) :=\n2\u03c0 \u03a3\nWe are lead by the analogy with the above discussion about the nonabelian case in dimension 5, to consider the Y M functional in dimension 3, where the point singularities would be classified by the value\nof\n[c1 (P |\u2202B\u03b5 (x) )] \u2208 H 2 (B 3 , Z)\n\n\f6\n\nMIRCEA PETRACHE,TRISTAN RIVI\u00c8RE\n\nfor any sufficiently small sphere \u2202B\u03b5 (x) near an isolated singular point\nx. The corresponding classes P and R\u221e for U(1)-bundles, are defined\nas above, substituting \"SU(2), c2 (P |\u2202B5 (x) )\" with \"U(1), c1 (P |\u2202B3 (x) )\".\nRemark 2.3. We are helped in our approach by the fact that in the\nabelian case the curvature of a U(1)-bundle over B 3 projects to a welldefined curvature 2-form on B 3 (see for example [KN96a, KN96b]),\nthereby simplifying our definition. This is the reason why our results\ndo not immediately generalize to the nonabelian case.\nUp to a universal constant, we can suppose that the projected 2-forms\nhave integral in Z along any closed surface (possibly containing singular\npoints).\nWe have therefore the following candidate for the class seeked in\nOpen Problem 1:\nDefinition 2.4 (Lp -curvatures of singular U(1)-bundles [KR08], Definition II.1). An Lp -curvature of a singular U(1)-bundle over B 3 is a\nmeasurable real-valued 2-form F satisfying\n\u2022\nZ\n|F |p dx3 < \u221e,\nB3\n\n3\n\n\u2022 For all x \u2208 B and for almost all 0 < r < dist(x, \u2202B 3 ) we have\nZ\ni\u2217\u2202Br (x) F \u2208 Z,\n\u2202Br (x)\n\nwhere\n\ni\u2217\u2202Br (x)\n3\n\nis the inclusion map of \u2202Br (x) in B 3 .\n\nWe call FZp (B ) the class of all such 2-forms F .\nWe observe that the above class is clearly closed in the strong Lp topology:\nLemma 2.5. The class FZp (B 3 ) is closed for the Lp topology.\nLp\n\nProof. We take a sequence Fk \u2208 FZp (B 3 ) such that Fk \u2192 F\u221e .

It has been already proved in [Kes08, KR08] that the\nclass R\u221e is dense in FZp for the Lp -topology (see also [Pet]).\nThe fact that c1 (P |\u2202B\u03b5 (x) ) 6= 0 for all \u03b5 small enough implies that\nthe curvature is not in Lp for p \u2265 3/2 (for example the form F =\n(4\u03c0r 2)\u22121 d\u03b8 \u2227 d\u03c6 \u2208 \u03a92 (B 3 \\ {0}) represents the curvature of an U(1)bundle over B 3 \\{0} having c1 = 1 on all spheres containing the origin,\nand it is an easy computation to show that F \u2208\n/ L3/2 . Therefore the\nstudy of the above defined Y M functional (i.e. the one equal to the L2 norm of the curvature) is trivial, no topological charge being possible.\nTherefore we study a similar functional where we substitute the Lp norm to the L2 -norm:\nZ\n|FA |p dx3 .\nY Mp (P ) =\nM\n\nFrom the above discussion it follows that singularities realizing nontrivial first Chern numbers arise only if p < 3/2. For such p the class\nFZp (B 3 ) is in bijection with the class LpZ (B 3 , R3 ) present in Theorem\n1.1, via the identification of k -covectors \u03b2 with (n \u2212 k)-vectors \u2217\u03b2 in\nRn , given by imposing\nh\u03b1, \u2217\u03b2i = h\u03b1 \u2227 \u03b2, ~ei\n\n(2.1)\n\nfor all (n \u2212 k)-covectors \u03b1, where ~e is an orientating vectorfield of Rn .\nAfter this identification, we can reformulate Theorem 1.1 as follows:\nTheorem 2.7 (Main Theorem). If p > 1 and Fn \u2208 FZp (B 3 ) and\n||Fn ||Lp \u2264 C < \u221e then we can find a subsequence Fn\u2032 converging\nweakly in Lp to a 2-form in FZp (B 3 ).\nThis answers Open Problem 1 in the case of U(1)-bundles:\nCorollary 2.8 (Solution to Open Problem 1 in the case of U(1)-bundles).\nIn the case of U(1)-bundles, the class FZp (B 3 ) with the sequential weak\nLp -topology solves Open Problem 1 when 1 < p < 3/2.\nA direct consequence of the above two results is the existence of\nminimizing U(1)-curvatures in FZp (B 3 ) under extra constraints, such\nas for example the imposition of a nontrivial boundary datum2.\n2We\n\nobserve that defining the Dirichlet boundary value minimization problem\nfor Y Mp on FZp (B 3 ) is a delicate issue, which will therefore be treated separately\n(see [Pet]).\n\n\f8\n\nMIRCEA PETRACHE,TRISTAN RIVI\u00c8RE\n\n2.4. Main points of the proof and outline of the paper. The\ncounterexample in Proposition 8.1 shows that Theorem 2.7 cannot hold\nin case p = 1, as in such case we obtain all currents and we possibly\nloose any integrality condition by weak convergence. This means that\nthe convexity of the Lp -norm arising when p > 1 is really needed for a\nresult similar to Theorem 2.7 to hold. On the other hand, the notions\nof a minimal connection as in [BCL86] or in [Iso98] are based on the\nduality between currents and smooth functions, where again no convexity is involved. Therefore we face the difficulty of finding a strategy\nmore adapted to our problem. A difficulty arising from the presence\nof a Lp -exponent different from 1 arised also in the work of Hardt\nand Rivi\u00e8re [HR03], where an extension of the the Cartesian Currents\nnotion of a minimal connection had to be introduced in order to treat\nsingularities of functions in W 1,3 (B 4 , S 2 ). For such definition one had\nto consider the class of scans, which are, roughly, a generalization of\ncurrents where the mass of slices is taken in L\u03b1 -norm with \u03b1 < 1 (instead of \u03b1 = 1, which would give back the usual mass as in [Fed69],\n4.3). In order to achieve the weak compactness result analogous to\nour Theorem 2.7, a particular distance between scans was introduced,\nwhich allowed a L1/\u03b1,\u221e -estimate. Such procedure was inspired by the\napproach of Ambrosio and Kirchheim [AK00], Sections 7 and 8, which\nused BV (instead of L1/\u03b1,\u221e ) bounds for functions with values in a suitable metric space, obtaining a rectifiability criterion and a new proof\nof the closure theorem for integral currents, via a maximal function\nestimate.\nIn the case of [AK00] the metric space considered was the one of\nrectifiable currents arising as slices of an initial current, with the flat\nmetric. In [HR03] a distance de extending the definition of the flat\nmetric was considered on the space of scans arising as slices of graphs.\nIn our case we introduce a metric on the space Y of Lp -forms arising\nas slices on concentric spheres of a given curvature F \u2208 FZp :\n\u001a\n\u001b\nZ\np\n2\nY := L (S ) \u2229 h :\nh\u2208Z .\nS2\n\nIn our case, for h1 , h2 \u2208 Y we define\n(\nd(h1 , h2 ) := inf\n\nkXkLp : h1 \u2212 h2 = divX + \u2202I +\n\nN\nX\n\ni=1\np\n\ndi \u03b4ai\n\n)\n\n,\n\nwhere the infimum is taken over all triples given by a L -vectorfield X ,\nan integer 1-current I of finite mass, and a finite set of integer degree\nsingularities, given by an N -ple of couples (ai , di ), where ai \u2208 S 2 and\n\n\fSINGULAR Lp -BUNDLES\n\n9\n\ndi \u2208 Z.\nThe fact that d is a metric is not immediate (see Section 3): in\nparticular the implication\nd(h1 , h2 ) = 0 \u21d2 h1 = h2\ndepends upon a result (see [Pet10], and Proposition 3.5) which says\nthat flow lines of a Lp -vectorfield on S 2 with divV = \u2202I where I is\nan integer multiplicity rectifiable 1-current of finite mass can be represented as preimages u\u22121 (y), y \u2208 S1 , for some u \u2208 W 1,p (S 2 , S 1 ).\nThe estimate connecting the distance d above to the ideas of [AK00,\nHR03] is (see Proposition 4.1) a bound on the lipschitz constant of the\nslice function\nh : [s\u2032 , s] \u2192 (Y, d),\n\nx 7\u2192 h(x) := Tx\u2217 i\u2217\u2202Bx (a) F,\n\nwhere Tx (\u03b8) := a + x\u03b8 maps S 2 to \u2202Bx (a). We estimate the lipschitz\nconstant of h in terms of the maximal function of the L1 -function\nf : [s\u2032 , s] \u2192 R+ ,\n\nf (x) := kh(x)kpLp ,\n\nan estimate in the same spirit of the one used in [HR03], which was a\ngeneralization of the pioneering approach of [AK00].\nIn Section 4 we prove a modified version of Theorem 9.1 of [HR03],\nwhich from the uniform Lp,\u221e -bound on a sequence of maximal functions Mfn defined as above (which is a direct consequence of the uniform Lp -bound on the sequence of curvatures Fn considered initially),\nallows us to deduce a kind of locally uniform pointwise convergence of\nthe slices hn (x) for a.e. x, up to the extraction of a subsequence. This\nuniformity is the main advantage of our whole construction, and this\nis why we have to introduce the above distance and maximal estimate.\nThe seed from which our technique grew was planted by [AK00], and\nfirst developed in [HR03].\nSection 6 is devoted to the verification of the hypotheses of the abstract Theorem 5.1, and Section 7 concludes that we can extract a\nsubsequence as requested by Theorem 2.7.\nThe last Section 8 is devoted to the proving the \"p = 1\" part of Theorem 1.1, thereby also justifying the assumption \"p > 1\" of Theorem\n2.7.\n\n\f10\n\nMIRCEA PETRACHE,TRISTAN RIVI\u00c8RE\n\n3.

We observe that up to changing the current I and the\nsingularity set in the above triples, we may reduce to considering the\ncase where the singularity set contains only one given point, for example\nthe origin 0. More precisely, we can say that an equivalent formulation\nof the above distance is\nd(h1 , h2 ) = inf {||X||Lp : h1 \u2212 h2 = divX + \u2202I + d\u03b40 } ,\nwhere the infimum is now taken on all triples (X, I, d), where X, I are\nas above, and d is some integer number.\nRemark 3.2.

In Theorem 5.1 we considered the interval [0, 1] instead\nof [s\u2032 , s] just for the sake of simplicity; the above results clearly extend\nalso to the general case.\nProof. Claim 1. It is enough to find a subsequence fn\u2032 which is pointwise a.e. Cauchy convergent. Indeed, in such case for a.e. x \u2208 [0, 1]\nthere will exist a unique limit f (x) := lim fn\u2032 (x) \u2208 \u0176 , the completion\nof Y . For such x we can then use Fatou's lemma and (5.5), obtaining\nfor a.e. x a further subsequence n\u2032\u2032 (which depends on x), along which\nN (fn\u2032\u2032 (x)) stays bounded. By compactness of the sublevels of N we\nthen have that f (x) \u2208 Y .\nNext, the lower semicontinuity of N implies that the property (5.5)\npasses to the limit, while for the other claimed property we may take\nd(h(x), h(x\u0303))\n\u00d1I h(x) := sup\n|x \u2212 x\u0303|\nI\u220bx\u03036=x\nand then use (5.1) to obtain\nd(h(x), h(x\u0303)) = lim\nd(hn\u2032 (x), hn\u2032 (x\u0303)) \u2264 lim \u2032inf NI hn\u2032 (x)|x \u2212 x\u2032 |,\n\u2032\nn\n\nn\n\nwhich gives (5.4) for \u00d1I hn\u2032 , since it shows that \u00d1I h(x) \u2264 lim inf n\u2032 NI hn\u2032 (x).\nThis proves Claim 1.\nWanted properties. We will obtain the wanted subsequence (n\u2032 )\nby starting with n0 (j) = j and successively extracting a subsequence\nnk (j) of nk\u22121 (j) for increasing k . In parallel to this (for each k \u2265 0)\n\u2022 we will select countable families Ik of closed subintervals of\n[0, 1] which cover [0, 1] up to a nullset Zk\n\u2022 for I \u2208 Ik we will give a point cI \u2208 I such that yj,I := hnk (j) (cI )\nare Cauchy sequences for all I \u2208 Ik and\n1\n(5.6)\nlim sup NI hnk (j) (cI ) \u2264\nk|I|\nj\n\n\fSINGULAR Lp -BUNDLES\n\n19\n\nClaim 2. The above choices guarantee the existence of a pointwise\nalmost everywhere Cauchy subsequence hn\u2032 . Indeed, we can then take\na diagonal subsequence j \u2032 = nj (j), and use the fact that the nullsets\nZk have as union a nullset Z . Then for I \u2208 Ik with k big enough, we\nhave d(fi\u2032 (cI ), fj \u2032 (cI )) < \u03b5/3 for i\u2032 , j \u2032 big enough, while for x \u2208 I , by\n(5.6) there exists C close to 1 such that\n1\nd(hi\u2032 (x), hi\u2032 (cI )) \u2264 NI hi\u2032 (cI )|I| \u2264 C .\nk\nFrom these two estimates it follows that for all x \u2208 [0, 1] \\ Z the sequence hj \u2032 is Cauchy, as wanted.\nObtaining the wanted properties. The subsequence nk (j) of\nnk\u22121 (j) will be also obtained by a diagonal extraction applied to a\nnested family of subsequences nk\u22121 \u227a m1 \u227a m2 \u227a . . . (where a \u227a\nb means that b(j) is a subsequence of a(j)). We describe now the\nprocedure used to pass from nk\u22121 to m1 .\nWe choose an integer q such that\nq > 2k p sup \u03bcn ([0, 1])\nn\n\nand we let I be the decomposition of [0, 1] into 2q non-overlapping\nsubintervals of equal length. Then for each n we can find q \"good\"\nintervals in I having \u03bcn -measure less than 1/(2k p ). The possible\nchoices of such subsets of intervals being finite, we can find one such\nchoice of subintervals {I1 , . . . , Iq } \u2282 I and a subsequence m0 \u227b nk\u22121\nsuch that for any of these fixed \"good\" intervals and for any j \u2208 N,\nthere holds\n1\n\u03bcm0 (j) (Ii ) < p .\n(5.7)\n2k\nFor a fixed interval Ii , we now give a name to the set of points where\n(5.6) is falsified at step m0 (j):\n\u001b\n\u001a\n1\n.\n(5.8)\nEm0 (j) := x \u2208 Ii : NIi hm0 (j) (x) >\nk|Ii |\nThen by (5.4), (5.7), (5.8) and since |Ii | \u2264 |I| = 1, we obtain\n1\n1\n|Em0 (j) | \u2264 k p |Ii |p \u03bcm0 (j) (Ii ) < |Ii |p \u2264 |Ii |.\n2\n2\nfor j large enough, and therefore by Fatou lemma we get\n\u0015\n\u0014\nZ\n1\n|Ii |\n5\n|Ii |\nN (hm0 (j) (x)) dx \u2264 |Ii | +\nL = |Ii |\nlim inf \u03c7Em0 (j) (x) +\nj\n3L\n2\n3L\n6\nIi\n\n\f20\n\nMIRCEA PETRACHE,TRISTAN RIVI\u00c8RE\n\nTherefore we can find cIi \u2208 Ii and a subsequence m1 \u227b m0 so that\nalong m1 we have\n|Ii |\nN (hm1 (j) (cIi )) < 1,\n\u03c7Em1 (j) (cIi ) +\n3L\nin particular cIi \u2208\n/ Em1 (j) for all j , and N (fm1 (j) (cIi )) is bounded. The\nlatter fact allows us to find a Cauchy subsequence m2 \u227b m1 , while\nthe former one gives us the wanted property (5.6) for Ii . We can\nfurther extract such subsequences in order to obtain the same property\nfor all the \"good\" intervals I1 , . . . , Iq . These intervals cover 1/2 of\nthe Lebesgue measure of [0, 1], so we may continue the argument by\nan easy exhaustion, covering [0, 1] by \"good\" intervals up to a set of\nmeasure zero.\n\u0003\n6. Verification of the properties needed in Theorem 5.1\nWe have seen that the functions NI hn defined in Section 5 satisfy\nthe hypotheses (5.1) and (5.4), as follows from (5.3) if we choose\nZ\n\u03bcn (I) := C khn (x)kpLp (D2 ) dx.\nI\n\nIn order to use the abstract theorem 5.1, we specify the space\nZ\np\n2\nh \u2208 Z},\nY := {h \u2208 L (D, \u2227 D) :\n\n(6.1)\n\nD\n\nwhere D is a 2-dimensional domain (for example [0, 1]2 or S 2 ) and we\ndefine the functional N : Y \u2192 R+ by\nZ\nN (h) :=\n|h|p dx.\n(6.2)\nD\n\nY is a metric space with the distance d (this was proved in Proposition\n3.3).

By taking as a test function f \u2261 1, which is in\nthe dual space Lq since D is bounded, we also obtain that k\u221e \u2208 Y .\nUp toRextracting\nR a subsequence we may also assume that for all n we\nhave D hn = D k\u221e \u2208 Z.

Proof of Theorem 2.7\nOur strategy will be to apply Theorem 5.1 to the sequence hn arising\nfrom the Fn of Theorem 2.7. We start with two relatively elementary\nlemmas.\nLemma 7.1. Suppose that d(hn (t), h\u221e (t)) \u2192 0 for almost all t \u2208 I .\nThen for all \u03b1, \u03b5 > 0 there exists a subset E\u03b1,\u03b5 \u2282 I such that |E\u03b1,\u03b5 | < \u03b5\nand that there exists N\u03b1,\u03b5 such that n > N\u03b1,\u03b5 and t \u2208 E\u03b1,\u03b5 imply\nd(hn (t), h\u221e (t)) < \u03b1\nProof. Call Em,n := {x \u2208 I : d(hi (x), h\u221e (x)) \u2264 1/m for i \u2265 n}. Then\nfor fixed m\u03b1 > \u03b1\u22121 , the sets Em\u03b1 ,n form an increasing sequence whose\nunion is I . It follows that |Em\u03b1 ,n | \u2192 |I|, so we find N\u03b1,\u03b5 such that\n|I \\ Em\u03b1 ,N\u03b1,\u03b5 | \u2264 \u03b5. We then choose E\u03b1,\u03b5 := Em\u03b1 ,N\u03b1,\u03b5 . It is easy to verify\nthat this set is as wanted.\n\u0003\nLemma 7.2. Fix x \u2208 I and a 2-form h\u221e (x). For all c > 0 there\nexists \u03b5 > 0 such that\n\u001b\nZ\nZ\nd(h(x),\nh\n(x))\n<\n\u03b1\n\u221e\nR\n\u21d2 h(x) = h\u221e (x).\n|h(x)|p \u2264 A\n\nProof. Suppose by contradiction that there exists a A > 0 such that\nfor all k \u2208 N there exists hk such that\n1\nd(hk (x), h\u221e (x)) \u2264\nk\nZ\n|hk (x)|p \u2264 A\nZ\nZ\nhk (x) 6=\nh\u221e (x)\n\nBy the second property, we can extract a subsequence hk\u2032 (x) of the\nhk (x) converging weakly in Lp . In particular we would then have\nZ\nZ\nZ \u220b hk\u2032 (x) \u2192 h\u2032\u221e (x)\n\n\f24\n\nMIRCEA PETRACHE,TRISTAN RIVI\u00c8RE\n\nIn particular, for some N \u2208 N large enough, the subsequence hk\u2032\u2032 :=\nhk\u2032 +N (x) satisfies\nZ\nZ\nhk\u2032\u2032 (x) = h\u2032\u221e (x).\n\nWe now prove that h\u221e (x) = h\u2032\u221e (x). It is enough to prove that\nd\nhk\u2032\u2032 (x) \u2192 h\u2032\u221e (x). and this follows exactly as in the\nR proof ofR Proposition 6.2. We thus contradicted the assumption hk (x) 6= h\u221e (x),\nas wanted.\n\u0003\n\nProof of Theorem 2.7. By the Lp -boundedness of the Fn , it is clear\nLp\nthat we may find a weakly converging subsequence Fn\u2032 \u21c0 F\u221e . We\nsuppose by contradiction that there exists a point x \u2208 B1 (0) and two\nradii 0 < s\u2032 < s < dist(x, \u2202B1 (0)) such that\nZ\n\u2032\n1\n\u2203S \u2282 [s , s] s.t. H (S) > 0 and \u2200t \u2208 S,\ni\u2217\u2202Bt (x) F \u2208\n/ Z. (7.1)\n\u2202Bt (x)\n\nWe then identify the forms given by\n\nF\u0303n |\u2202Br (x) := i\u2217\u2202Br (x) F for r \u2208 [s\u2032 , s],\nwith functions (defined almost everywhere) hn : [s\u2032 , s] \u2192 Y (with the\nnotations of Section 5). We suppose without affecting the proof that\n[s\u2032 , s] = I (see also Remark 5.2). By Theorem 5.1, we can assume (up\nto extracting a subsequence) that there exists h\u221e such that for almost\nall t \u2208 I there holds d(hn (t), h\u221e (t)) \u2192 0.\nWe call\n\nZ\n\nhn (x) \u2212\n\nZ\n\nh\u221e (x) := fn (t).\n\nSince we have fn \u2265 0, if we prove that the fn converge in L1 -norm,\nthen the almost everywhere pointwise convergence follows, implying\nthe fact that |S| = 0 and reaching the wanted contradiction. To prove\nTheorem 2.7 we therefore have to prove that\nZ\nlim\nfn (t)dt = 0.\n(7.2)\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nWe start by calling\n\nFn,A :=\n\n\u001a\n\nt\u2208I:\n\nZ\n\n\u001b\n|hn (t)| \u2265 A .\np\n\nIt clearly follows that (with C as in the statement of the theorem)\n\u0013\nZ \u0012Z\n1\nC\np\n|Fn,A | \u2264\n|hn (t)| dt =\nA\nA\n\n\fSINGULAR Lp -BUNDLES\n\n25\n\nNow take A such that the above quantity is smaller than \u03b5, and use\nLemma 7.2 to obtain a constant \u03b1R such that d(hn (t), h\u221e (t)) < \u03b1 implies fn (t) = 0 for t such that |hn (t)|p < A, i.e. for t \u2208\n/ Fn,A .\nWith such choice of \u03b1 apply Lemma 7.1 and obtain a set E\u03b1,\u03b5 so that\n|I \\E\u03b1,\u03b5 | < \u03b5 and an index N\u03b1,\u03b5 such that for n \u2265 N\u03b1,\u03b5 and for t \u2208 E\u03b1,\u03b5\nthere holds d(hn (t), 0) < \u03b1, and therefore fn (t) = 0.\nFor n > N\u03b1,\u03b5 , the function fn (t) can therefore be nonzero only on\nE\u03b1,\u03b5 \u222a Fn,A , and we have\nZ\nZ\nfn (t)dt \u2264\nfn (t)dt\nE\u03b1,\u03b5 \u222aFn,A\n\n\u2264 |E\u03b1,\u03b5 \u222a Fn,A |\n\n1\u22121/p\n\n\u2264 (2\u03b5)1\u22121/p C,\n\n\u0014Z\n\n\u00151/p\n|fn (t)| dt\np\n\nwhence the claim (7.2) follows by the arbitrarity of \u03b5 > 0, finishing the\nproof of our result.\n\u0003\n8. The case p = 1\nWe prove here the result stated in the Main Threorem 1.1 for p = 1,\nthereby showing also that the thesis of Theorem 2.7 cannot hold when\np = 1. We consider the case when the domain is [0, 1]3 for simplicity.\nThe case of general domains is totally analogous.\nProposition 8.1. Consider a signed Radon measure X \u2208 M3 ([0, 1]3 ),\nwith total variation equal to 1. Then there exists a family of vectorfields\nXk \u2208 L1Z such that\n(1) There are two constants 0 < c < C < \u221e such that\n\u001a\n\u2200k c < kXk kL1 ([0,1]3 ) < C\nM(divXk ) \u2192 \u221e\n(2) divXk = \u2202Ik for a sequence of integer rectifiable currents Ik of\nbounded mass, and finally\nXk \u21c0 X\nFrom the above, it immediately follows:\nCorollary 8.2. The class FZ1 is not closed by weak convergence.\nThe following holds for all p <\n\nn\nn\u22121\n\nin n dimensions:\n\n\f26\n\nMIRCEA PETRACHE,TRISTAN RIVI\u00c8RE\n\nLemma 8.3. Given a segment [a, b] \u2282 Rn of length \u03b5 > 0 and a\nn\nnumber \u03b4 > 0, if p < n\u22121\nthen it is possible to find a vectorfield\np\nn\nn\nX \u2208 L (R , R ) with\ndivX = \u03b4a \u2212 \u03b4b ,\nsptX \u2282 [a, b] + B\u03b5 (0),\nkXkLp \u2264 C\u03b5n\u2212(n\u22121)p\nwhere C is a geometric constant, and for two sets A, B , we denote\nA + B := {a + b : a \u2208 A, b \u2208 B}.\nProof. We may suppose that a = (\u2212\u03b5, 0, . . . , 0), b = (\u03b5, 0, . . . , 0) first.\nWe then define the piecewise smooth\n(\n\u0010\n\u0011\n1\ns\nX(\u00b1\u03b5(t \u2212 1), \u03b5st) =\n, \u00b1 \u03b5tn\u22121 |Bn\u22121 | for (t, s) \u2208 [0, 1] \u00d7 B1n\u22121\n\u03b5tn\u22121 |B1n\u22121 |\n1\nX(x, y) = (0, 0) if |x| + |y|Rn\u22121 > \u03b5.\nThen clearly sptX \u2282 [a, b] + B\u03b5 , and using the divergence theorem it\nis also easily shown that divX = \u03b4a \u2212 \u03b4b in the sense of distributions.\nFor the last estimate, we observe that\nC\n\u03c7{|x|+|y|\u2264\u03b5}(x, y),\n|X(x, y)| \u2264\n(\u03b5 \u2212 |x|)n\u22121\nso we can estimate\nZ\nZ\np\n|X| dx dy \u2264 C\nR2\n\n= C\u03b5\n\n\u03b5\n\n(\u03b5 \u2212 x)n\u22121\ndx\n(\u03b5 \u2212 x)(n\u22121)p\n\n0\nn\u2212(n\u22121)p\n\n\u0003\nProof of Proposition 8.1. We will do our construction first in the simpler model case F = dy \u2227 dzx[0, 1]3 . The modifications leading to the\ngeneral case are treated separately.\n\u2022 The case of X \u2261 (1, 0, 0). We consider the collections of segments in [0, 1]3 given by\n\b\u0002\n\u0001\n\u0001\u0003\nSk :=\n\u22122\u22123k\u22121 , 0, 0 , 2\u22123k\u22121 , 0, 0 + (a, b, c) : (a, b, c) \u2208 2\u2212k Z3 \u2229]0, 1[3 .\nWe then define an integral rectifiable 1-current Ik as the canonical integration from right to left along all the segments of Sk .\nThere clearly holds\nM(Ik ) = 2\u22123k (2k \u2212 1)3 \u2192 1,\n\n(8.1)\n\nand it is a standard exercise in geometric measure theory (based\non the approximation of H3 x[0, 1]3 by sums of Dirac measures\n\n\fSINGULAR Lp -BUNDLES\n\n27\n\nin the points 2\u2212k Z3 \u2229]0, 1[3 ) to show that there holds:\nIk \u21c0 H3 x[0, 1]3 \u2297 dx \u2243 (1, 0, 0).\n\n(8.2)\n\nWe can then use Lemma 8.3 for each one of the segments in\nSk and with \u03b4 = 12 \u03b5 = 2\u22123k (which produces a set of (2k \u2212 1)3\nvectorfields with disjoint supports, which can then be consistently extended to zero outside the set of the supports) each of\nwhose L1 -norms is equal to C\u03b52 max{\u03b4 \u22121 , \u03b5\u22121 } = 2\u22123k C , which\nis proportional to the mass of the respective segment. Therefore\n(using (8.2)), property (1) follows.\nThe last point of the proposition follows by proving that also\nthe vectorfields Xk converge as 1-currents to the diffuse current\nX . The strategy used is as the one usually adopted for the proof\nof the converence of the Ik : for a fixed smooth vectorfield a and\nfor k \u2192 \u221e we may approximate\nXZ\nXk * a\nhXk , ai :=\nsptX \u03c3\n\n\u03c3\u2208Sk\n\nX\n\n=\n\nP \u2208Z3 \u2229]0,1[3\n\n+\n\nZ\n\nsptX \u03c3\n\n=\n\nX\n\n\u0014\u0012Z\n\nsptX \u03c3\n\n\u0013\nXk (x)dx * a(P ) +\n\n\u0015\nXk (x) * Da(P )[x \u2212 P ]dx + Oa (2\u22123k )\n2\u22123k (1, 0, 0) * a(P ) + Oa (2\u22123k )\n\nP \u22082\u2212k Z3 \u2229]0,1[3\n\n\u2192\n\nZ\n\na(x) * (1, 0, 0)dx\n[0,1]3\n\nwhere the integral containing the differential Da is zero by the\nsymmetry properties of X \u03c3 and using the fact that\n\u001b\n\u001a\n|Oa (\u03b5)|\na(x + \u03b5u) \u2212 a(x)\n3\n2\n\u2264 sup\n\u2212 Da(x)[u] : x \u2208 B1 , u \u2208 S\n\u03b5\n\u03b5\n\u2192 0 as \u03b5 \u2192 0.\n\u2022 The case of X = (\u03c1, 0, 0) \u2208 M3 ([0, 1]3 ), where \u03c1 is a probability\ndensity on [0, 1]3 . In this case we consider the 23k disjoint cubes\nCk having the same centers as the segments in Sk and sidelength\n2\u2212k , and in the above construction we substitute to the segment\n\u03c3k \u2208 Sk the segment \u03c3k\u2032 having the same center, but length\nequal to \u03c1(Ck ), where Ck \u2208 Ck is the cube with center equal to\nthe one of \u03c3k and \u03c3k\u2032 .

We can write (by Radon-Nikodym decomposition):\n\u2212 +\n\u2212 +\n\u2212\nX = (\u03c1+\n1 \u2212 \u03c11 , \u03c12 \u2212 \u03c12 , \u03c13 \u2212 \u03c13 ),\n\nwhere \u03c1i are positive Radon measures of mass less than 1.\nDoing separately the construction in the previous point for all\nthe \u03c1i we obtain integer rectifiable currents Ik of mass bounded\nby 6, each of which is supported on finitely many segments.\nApplying Lemma 8.3 to each of the above segments, we obtain\nvectorfields converging as before to the measure X , and since\nthe supports of the vectorfields obtained in this way superpose\nnot more than 6 times, the estimate of the Lemma (used here\nfor p = 1) still holds, up to changing the constant.\n\u0003\nReferences\n[AK00]\n\nLuigi Ambrosio and Bernd Kirchheim, Currents in metric spaces, Acta\nMath. 185 (2000), no. 1, 1\u201380.\n[BCDH91] F.
