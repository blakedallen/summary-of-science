We find that the inclusion of non-locality in the two-nucleon bare interaction\nstrongly affects saturation, but it is unable to provide a consistent description of few-body nuclear\nsystems and nuclear matter.\nPACS numbers: 21.65.+f, 24.10.Cn, 21.30.-x\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe effective nucleon-nucleon (NN) interaction is expected, on physical grounds, to be intrinsically non-local.\nThe quark structure of nucleons implies that the potential between two interacting nucleons cannot be expressed only in terms of the center of mass degree of freedom, at least for distances smaller than twice the nucleon\nradius. Even a description of the NN interaction in terms\nof one-boson exchange processes introduces some degree\nof non-locality [1]. For practical purposes, however, it\nis convenient to have a local (energy independent) NN\ninteraction, to be used in numerical applications. The\nmodeling of the NN interaction by a local potential, with\npossible guidance from meson exchange processes, has\nbeen extremely successful in reproducing the NN experimental phase shifts and deuteron properties [2, 3]. This\napproach has developed for many years and has reached\na high degree of sophistication.\nIt has been established by now that these local NN\npotentials, which are essentially phase equivalent, give\nslightly different results for the three- and four-nucleon\nsystems. Furthermore, in general they underestimate the\nbinding energy and do not give the correct values for\nsome polarization observables. This drawback has been\nusually overcome by introducing three-body forces, which\ncan be again justified by the non-elementary nature of\nthe nucleon. Actually three-body forces can be generated also by meson-exchange processes of higher order,\nwhere the nucleon is excited in the intermediate states of\nthe interaction processes or meson-meson couplings are\nintroduced [4]. Both non-locality and three-body forces\ncan be considered to have a common origin, the inner\nstructure of the nucleon. However, one cannot fully reduce one to another, since non-locality has definite effects\nalready at the two-body level, e.g. a non-local potential\ncannot be equivalent, in general, to an energy independent local potential. Furthermore, it is not clear to what\nextent the off-shell behavior of a non-local potential, i.e.\nthe off shell T -matrix, can be simulated by the presence\nof three-body forces.\nAnother question where non-locality could play a role\n\nis the mechanism of saturation in nuclear matter. In\nfact, it turns out that in order to get saturation with\na local (energy independent) interaction, it is essential\nto include a strong repulsive core, as also suggested by\nthe behavior of the NN phase shifts. Again, three-body\nforces are necessary to tune the saturation point close to\nthe empirical one. It is surely conceivable that a certain\ndegree of non-locality could simulate the strong repulsion\nat short distance, which is one of the main features of the\nNN interaction, and maybe reduce the need of three-body\nforces.\nIt appears, therefore, of great interest to investigate to\nwhat extent non-locality alone could enable to get saturation, possibly close to the empirical one, and at the same\ntime to describe three- and four-body systems correctly.\nRecently, in a series of papers by Doleschall and collaborators [5, 6, 7], a new realistic non-local NN potential\nwas proposed, which is able to describe accurately both\nthe NN phase shifts and the properties of three-nucleon\nsystems (3 He and 3 H), i.e. their binding energies and\nradii. Also the alpha particle appears to be reasonably\nwell described [8]. The need of three-body forces in this\ncase seems to be absent, or completely simulated by the\nnon-locality.\nThis NN interaction introduces non-locality at short\ndistance (r \u2264 3 fm\u22121 ) for the s-wave channels, and possibly also for the p-waves ones [7]. The rest of the potential\nis taken as the Argonne v18 [2], while the non-local part\nis purely phenomenological.\nIn this paper we address the issue of the saturation\nproperties of non-local potentials. To this purpose we\npresent nuclear matter calculations within the BetheBrueckner-Goldstone method extended up to three holeline contributions, which is known to converge well and\nto give an accurate nuclear matter saturation curve.\nAs the main representative of non-local NN interaction we take the potential of ref. [6]. We compare the\ncorresponding nuclear matter Equation of state (EOS)\nwith those obtained starting from the charge-dependent\n(CD) Bonn [9] and the v18 potentials. The former can\nbe considered the most recent and accurate interaction\nbased on the one-boson exchange model and, therefore,\n\n\f2\n\nII.\n\nLOCAL VS. NON-LOCAL NN POTENTIALS.\n\nBefore studying infinite nuclear matter and in order\nto better understand the role played by the different NN\ninteractions in the nuclear matter calculations of next\n\n40\n\n1\n\nV(q0,q0) (MeV fm3)\n\n30\n\nS0\n\n20\n10\n0\n-10\n\nv18\nNL\nCD Bonn\nR v18\nR NL\nR CD Bonn\n\n-20\n-30\n-40\n-50\n\n3\n\nV(q0,q0) (MeV fm3)\n\n30\n\nS1\n\n20\n10\n0\n-10\n-20\n-30\n-40\n-50\n\nV(q0,q0) (MeV fm3)\n\nit contains some degree of non-locality. The latter is a\nconvenient reference local potential for the comparison\nwith Doleschall's, which, as we stated above, coincides\nwith the v18 in the L \u2265 1 channels. Additionally, other\nmodern local potentials, like Argonne v14 [3] or Paris potential [10], give similar results, close enough to v18 to be\nconsidered equivalent for the present purpose [11].\nThe study of phase-shift equivalent NN interactions\nand their predictions of nuclear matter saturation properties has a long history. For example in refs. [12, 13]\nunitarily equivalent interactions which differ in the short\nrange part of the 1 S0 channel were shown to provide\nrather different values of the saturation energy and density. More recently, the predictions of modern NN potentials were studied in refs. [14, 15, 16]. Here the role\nof non-locality in the binding energy of nuclear matter\nwas also partially discussed, using the CD Bonn and the\nNijmegen-I [17] potentials, which were shown to provide\na stronger binding than local potentials such as the v18 .\nHowever, both these potentials underestimate the binding energy of three- and four-body systems [19], at variance with Doleschall's interaction [6]. Therefore when\nusing the latter we can, in principle, expect different results also for nuclear matter calculations.\nIt is well known that the saturation points obtained\nwithin the Brueckner approximation for the gap choice\nand different NN interactions tend to lie along a band\n[11], the celebrated \"Coester band\", in the energy-density\nplane. The position inside the band for a given NN interaction turns out to be correlated with the d-state probability in the deuteron. The high-energy, high-density part\nof the band is usually associated with low values of this\nprobability. However, as shown in ref. [18], this trend\ndoes not hold any more if three hole-line contributions\nare included, as we do in the present paper. In this case\nthe results are quite insensitive to the d-wave probability\nvalue and actually close to each other, at least for local potentials or quasi-local potentials like the Paris one.\nThe same conclusion holds true if the continuous choice\nfor the single particle potential is used in the Brueckner\napproximation [11].\nThe paper is organized in the following way. In Section II we shortly study the free space properties of the\nDoleschall, CD Bonn and v18 potentials. In Section III,\nafter introducing the BBG formalism, we study the EOS\nof nuclear matter obtained with Doleschall's potential,\naddressing, in particular, the issue of the convergence\nof the hole-line expansion in this case. We then compare this EOS with those obtained starting from the two\nother potentials. Finally in Section IV we draw our conclusions.\n\n3\n\nS-D1\n\n10\n5\n0\n-5\n-10\n-15\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n6\nq0 (fm-1)\n\n8\n\n10\n\nFIG. 1: Diagonal matrix elements of the v18 (solid line),\nCD Bonn (dotted) potentials and of Doleshall's IS potential\nof ref.

The latter describes the free space\nNN scattering and is obtained by solving the LippmannSchwinger equation, which for two nucleons interacting\nwith energy E in the center of mass frame can be written\nas:\nRllc \u2032 (k, k \u2032 ; E) = Vllc\u2032 (k, k \u2032 ) +\n(2)\nX Z \u221e\nM\n+\nP\nq 2 dqVllc\u2032\u2032 (k, q)\nRc (q, k \u2032 ; E) ,\n2 l\u2032\u2032 l\u2032\nM\nE\n\u2212\nq\n0\n\u2032\u2032\nl\n\nwhere the symbol P denotes the principal value integral\nand M is the free nucleon mass.\nFor realistic potentials the on-shell R-matrix,\n\n\u221a\nR(q0 , q0 ; E) with q0 = M E, is fixed, to a large extent,\nby the fitting of the experimental NN phase shifts.\nThe potentials we consider in the present paper were fit\nto reproduce the Nijmegen phase shifts [20] for energies\nup to 350 MeV in the laboratory frame, and therefore\ngive rise to practically identical on-shell values of the Rmatrix in this energy range. However, due to their totally\ndifferent analytical structure, a quite different behavior of\nthe bare NN matrix elements of eq. (1) can be expected,\nespecially when non-local potentials are compared with\nlocal ones.\nThis is illustrated in fig. 1, where the bare NN diagonal\nmatrix elements and the corresponding on-shell R-matrix\nfor the local v18 and the non-local CD Bonn are compared with those obtained from the non-local potential\nindicated as IS in ref. [6] and hereafter referred to as NL.\nHere the dominant S-wave channels are considered, for\nwhich the main non-locality has been introduced in ref.\n[6].

At small\nmomenta we see that in the 1 S0 channel the two non-local\npotentials are rather close to each other, while they differ significantly from the v18 This is still true in the 3 S1\nchannel, where, however, the difference between NL and\nCD Bonn is increased. It can be also seen that at increasing non-locality, i.e. going from the CD Bonn to the NL\npotential, the deviation form the local potential v18 is increasing. This is in agreement with refs. [14, 15], where\nit was shown that including non-locality makes the attraction provided by the integral term of eq. (2) weaker,\nthus requiring a less repulsive diagonal matrix element\nof V , in order to obtain the same on-shell R-matrix. In\nparticular it is interesting to note that the diagonal NL\npotential is always rather close to the corresponding onshell R-matrix elements, especially for the 3 S1 channel.\nIn the coupling channel 3 S1 -3 D1 we see that the three potentials are very close to each other at small momenta,\nwith NL deviating from the others at intermediate q.\nConsidering the large momentum behavior, we observe\nthat in all cases the CD Bonn potentials exhibits a much\nlarger tail.\n\nSince the diagonal matrix elements of the bare potentials are already so different from each other, is not surprising then that the off-shell behavior of both the bare\nV and the R-matrix is also different, as illustrated in\nfigs. 2 and 3, where the half off-shell matrix elements of\nthe bare potentials and of the R-matrix are shown for\nthree choices of the incident energy. The behavior of the\nbare potentials (left panels in the figures) shows essentially the same features we have already observed for the\ndiagonal matrix elements. The curves representing the\nR-matrix (right panels) are closer to each other, but still\nsensible differences are observed, especially when the results corresponding to the v18 are compared with the two\nother non-local potentials.\nFinally in fig. 4 we also show the half off-shell V and\nR 3 S-D1 matrix elements. Here only the tensor part of\nthe NN interaction can contribute, which was shown in\nprevious works to be strongly affected by the inclusion\nof non-locality [14, 15, 16], and which is known to play\nan important role in nuclear structure calculations. We\nsee that indeed, the inclusion of non-locality reduces the\nstrength of the interaction and, for the NL case, also the\n\n\f5\n\n50\n3\n\nR(q0,q;E) (MeV fm )\n\n0\n-5\nElab=25 MeV\n\n-10\n-15\n-20\n\nv18\nNL\nCD Bonn\n\n-2\nElab=150 MeV\n\n-6\n-10\n\n3\n\nS-D1\n\n-14\n\n3\n\nElab=25 MeV\n\n-50\n-100\n\nv18\nNL\nCD Bonn\n\n-150\n\n-2\nElab=150 MeV\n\n-6\n-10\n\n3\n\nS-D1\n\n-14\n-18\n\nR(q0,q;E) (MeV fm )\n\n-18\n0\n\n3\n\nV(q0,q) (MeV fm )\n\n0\n\n-200\n3\n\n-25\n\nR(q0,q;E) (MeV fm )\n\n3\n\nV(q0,q) (MeV fm )\n\n3\n\nV(q0,q) (MeV fm )\n\n5\n\n-2\n-4\n-6\nElab=350 MeV\n\n-8\n-10\n\n0\n-2\n-4\n-6\nElab=350 MeV\n\n-8\n-10\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n-1\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n-1\n\nq (fm )\n\nq (fm )\n\nFIG. 4: As fig. 2 but for the 3 S1 \u22123 D1 matrix elements.\n\nrange of momentum values where the matrix elements\nare significantly different from zero.\n\nIII.\n\nEOS OF NUCLEAR MATTER\nA.\n\nThe BBG expansion\n\nThe microscopic calculations of nuclear matter Equation of State, i.e. the energy per particle as a function of\ndensity, on the basis of realistic interactions has a long\nhistory. Theoretical and numerical methods, accurate\nenough for our considerations, are nowadays available.\nWe will follow the Bethe-Brueckner-Goldstone scheme,\nwhich has been proved [11] to be reliable in a wide range\nof density. In this expansion the original bare NN interaction v is systematically replaced by the G-matrix,\nwhich satisfies the integral equation\nG[\u03c1; \u03c9] = v +\n\nX\n\nka ,kb\n\nv\n\n|ka kb i Q hka kb |\nG[\u03c1; \u03c9] ,\n\u03c9 \u2212 e(ka ) \u2212 e(kb )\n\n(3)\n\nwhere e(k) is the single particle energy and Q the socalled Pauli operator which projects both intermediate\nsingle particle states above the Fermi surface. The diagrams in terms of the G-matrix are then ordered according to the numbers of hole-lines they contain. The\nintroduction of the self-consistent single particle potential U (k) is an essential ingredient of the method\nX\nhkk \u2032 |G(e(k) + e(k \u2032 ))|kk \u2032 iA\n(4)\nU (k) =\nk\u2032 <kF\n\nSince e(k) = h\u03042 k 2 /2M + U (k), eqs. (3,4) include a selfconsistent procedure which determines U (k). In particular we use the continuous choice for the potential U (k),\ni.e. the definition of eq. (4) is extended to all momenta k,\nbelow and above the Fermi momentum kF . More details\ncan be found in review papers or in textbooks [11]. We\nextend our calculations up to the three-hole line level of\napproximation, which has been shown to be accurate in\nrefs. [21, 22, 23] for a variety of NN potentials, including\nthe Argonne v14 and v18 and the Paris interactions.\nHowever, since Doleschall's NL potential is used here\nfor the first time in BBG calculations of nuclear matter,\n\n\f6\nBethe-Goldstone equation (3) in the channel c,\n\nPotential Energy (MeV)\n\n-20\n\nNL1 2h\nNL1 2h+3h\nNL2 2h\nNL2 2h+3h\n\n-30\n-40\n\nhkl|Gc (\u03c1, \u03c9)|k \u2032 l\u2032 i = Vllc\u2032 (k, k \u2032 )\n(5)\nZ\n\u221e\nX\nQ(q)\n+\nq 2 dqVllc\u2032\u2032 (k, q)\nhql\u2032\u2032 |Gc (\u03c1, \u03c9)|k \u2032 l\u2032 i ,\n\u03c9\n\u2212\nE(q)\n0\n\u2032\u2032\nl\n\n-50\n-60\n-70\n-80\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n-1\n\n2\n\n2.2\n\nkF (fm )\nFIG. 5: Potential energy per particle for symmetric nuclear matter calculated with the non-local potentials NL1\n(squares), which includes the non-locality in the 1 S0 channel\nonly, and NL2 (triangles), which has the non-locality both in\nthe 1 S0 and in the 3 S \u2212 D1 channels. Empty symbols correspond to the two hole-line calculations, while full symbols\nrepresent the full two + three hole-line results.\n\nbefore making comparisons of different EOS, we briefly\nstudy the accuracy of the BBG expansion in this case.\nThis is done in fig. 5, where the contributions to the\nbinding potential energy of the two hole-line (Brueckner)\nand three hole-line diagrams are reported. To keep the\ncalculations reliable, the latter has to be substantially\nsmaller than the former.\nTwo different choices for the NL potential are considered: the curves labeled as NL1 have been obtained using\nDoleschall's IS potential of ref. [6] only in the 1 S0 channel, while for the curves labeled as NL2 the non-local\npotential has been included also in the 3 S1 -3 D1 channel.\nIn the remaining channels the v18 interaction has been\nused.\nThe three hole-line contributions turn out to be slightly\nlarger than in the case of local potentials (see [21, 22,\n23]). However these corrections always remain within 23.5% for the NL1 case and within 2.5-4% for NL2, thus\nindicating that our calculations up to three hole-lines can\nbe considered accurate. It is interesting to note that\nwith the non-local potentials the corrections to the BHF\ncurves are positive, contrary to the case of the v18 , where,\nin the region 1.4 < kF < 2 f m \u22121 the three hole-line\ncontributions tend to make the EOS more attractive.\n\nB.\n\nNuclear matter saturation properties\n\nHaving established the validity of our calculations, we\ncan now turn our attention to the study of the saturation\nproperties of nuclear matter. To better understand the\nrole that the different potentials we studied in section II\nplay in the nuclear matter EOS it is useful to rewrite the\n\nwhere, following standard procedures [11], we have introduced the angle averaged expressions of the Pauli operator, Q, and of the energy, E, in the denominator of the\nintegral term. Eq. (5) closely resembles the LippmannSchwinger equation (2), the difference being due to the\npresence, in the former, of the Pauli blocking operator and of a different energy denominator. Both these\nterms produce a quenching of the integral term contribution in the Bethe-Goldstone equation with respect to\nthe Lippmann-Schwinger case. Therefore the behavior\nof the G-matrix is expected to be rather similar to that\nof the R-matrix, with this quenching effect being weaker\nfor the non-local potentials, for which the integral term\nis already small.\nSince the non-locality in the NL potential is introduced\nin the 1 S0 and in the coupled 3 S1 -3 D1 channels, we begin\nby studying the contributions of these channels to the potential binding energy per particle. This is done, at the\nBrueckner level, in fig. 6, where the results corresponding\nto the non-local CD Bonn (empty dots/dashed line) and\nNL potentials (triangles/dot-dashed) are compared with\nthe v18 (crosses/solid). In agreement with the discussion\nin section II, where we compared bare potentials and Rmatrix elements, we observe that in the 1 S0 channel the\nCD Bonn and NL potential contributions are very close\nto each other and that they provide additional binding,\nwith respect to the v18 case. When we consider the 3 S1\nand 3 D1 channels, again we see that the non-local potentials provide more binding, but in this case the NL\ncurve is significantly lower than the CD Bonn one. Since\nthe contributions from all other channels are very similar for the three potentials (with differences of the order\nof 1 MeV at the largest densities considered here), the\ndifferences observed in the 1 S0 and 3 S1 and 3 D1 channels determine the behavior of the total binding potential\nenergy, shown in the bottom panel of fig. 6.\nIn order to get further insight on the origin of the differences in the potential binding energy, in fig. 7 we also\nshow the potential U (k) for three different choices of the\ndensity, namely kF = 1.4, 1.6 and 1.8 fm\u22121 . The most\nimportant contribution to the total binding energy comes\nfrom the low k region, where the NL potential is, indeed,\nlower than the others. At large k the behavior of the CD\nBonn curve differs from the others, which is not surprising considering the different high momentum tail of the\npotential V shown, for example, in fig. 1. However this\nbehavior does not seem to affect the final result for the\nbinding energy.\nFinally, the saturation curve of nuclear matter is shown\nin figure 8, where, in order also to make contact with the\nexisting literature, e.g. [14, 15, 16], in the upper panel\nwe show results at the Brueckner level, while in the lower\n\n\f7\n\n200\n\n1\n\n-25\n-30\n\n50\n0\n-50\n\nv18\nNL\nCD Bonn\n\n-35\n\n-150\n300\n250\n\n3\n\nS1 + 3D1\n\n-15\n\nv18\nNL\nCD Bonn\n\n-100\n\n-1\n\nkF=1.6 fm\n\n200\n150\n\n-20\n\nU(k)\n\nPotential Binding Energy\n\n-1\n\nkF=1.4 fm\n\n100\n\n-20\n\n-40\n-10\n\n-25\n\n100\n50\n0\n\n-30\n-35\n\nv18\nNL\nCD Bonn\n\n-50\n\nv18\nNL\nCD Bonn\n\n-40\n-20\n\n-100\n-150\n500\n400\n\ntotal\n\n-30\n\n300\n\n-40\n\nU(k)\n\nPotential Binding Energy\n\n150\n\nS0\n\n-15\n\nU(k)\n\nPotential Binding Energy\n\n-10\n\n-50\n\n-1\n\nkF=1.8 fm\n\n200\n100\n0\n\n-60\n-70\n-80\n1\n\n1.2\n\nv18\nNL\nCD Bonn\n\n-100\n\nv18\nNL\nCD Bonn\n\n-200\n0\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\n2\n\n2.2\n\nkF (fm-1)\n\nFIG. 6: Contributions of the different channels to the potential binding energy per particle (in MeV) vs. the Fermi momentum kF .

All curves are\ncalculated at the 2 hole-line level.\n\npanel we include contributions at the three-hole line level.\nAgain, as a reference curve we take the one obtained\nusing the Argonne v18 interaction (solid line): as it is\nwell established, the saturation density it gives is slightly\nlarger than the empirical one, and three-body forces can\nbe introduced to correct for this drawback [11, 24]. This\nis just the issue we want to address, and therefore all the\ncalculations will be presented without the introduction of\nthree-body forces, in order to see to what extent the nonlocality can affect this result and in which direction.

Also relativistic effects can shift the saturation point, as described within\nthe Dirac-Brueckner (DB) approach [1]. However, it has\nbeen shown in ref. [25] that the relativistic effects introduced in DB calculations can be described in terms of\nnon-relativistic three-body forces due to virtual creation\nof nucleon-antinucleon pairs.\nLet us now consider the other two interactions, which\ndisplay different degrees of non-locality. The CD Bonn\nat the Brueckner level has been already studied in ref.\n[26] and more recently in ref. [27]. The corresponding\nsaturation curve reported in fig. 8 is in agreement with\nprevious studies.

This\nis somehow at variance with the results for few nucleon\nsystems, where the CD Bonn seems to produce binding\nenergies closer to the experimental ones [19].\nThe Doleschall' s potential moves further in this direction. As in fig.5 we consider again the NL1 and NL2\ncases. The saturation density, as one can see in fig. 8, is\nlarger than in the v18 case already for the NL1 curve and\nit becomes abnormally large when both 1 S0 and 3 S-D1\nchannels include non-locality (NL2), with the energy per\nparticle going down to about -26 MeV. The very large\nstrength for the three-body forces needed in this case,\nfor shifting the saturation curve close to the phenomenological one, is in sharp contrast with the excellent results\nobtained [5, 6, 7, 8] for few body systems, where virtually\nno three-body forces are needed.\nIt looks that any increase of the non-locality would\nimprove the fitting of the binding for the few body, but\nwould shift the saturation point to higher density and\nbinding energy.\n\n-20\n-25\n\nIV.\n\n2 hole + 3 hole\n\n-30\n1.2\n\n1.3\n\n1.4\n\n1.5 1.6 1.7\nkF (fm-1)\n\n1.8\n\n1.9\n\n2\n\nFIG. 8: Energy per particle (in MeV) for symmetric nuclear matter calculated for the v18 and CD Bonn potentials\nand for the non-local interactions NL1, which includes the\nnon-locality in the 1 S0 channel only, and NL2, where the\nnon-locality is included both in the 1 S0 and in the 3 S \u2212 D1\nchannels.

While the introduction of non-locality is\nable to improve the agreement with phenomenology in\nfew-body systems, where it can reduce or even eliminate\nthe need of three-body forces, in nuclear matter we observe a parallel shift of the saturation point in the wrong\ndirection, away from the empirical saturation point. The\npresence of non-locality seems to be unable to solve one of\nthe fundamental problem in the many-body description\nof nuclear systems, i.e. the (in)consistency of the threebody forces needed in few-body nuclear systems and in\nnuclear matter.\n\nsubstantially larger than for v18 .\nThe introduction of three hole-line contributions\nslightly improves the situation, since the three hole-line\ndiagrams give an overall additional repulsion, which however is much smaller than the two hole-line contribution.\nAs shown in the bottom panel of fig. 8, the binding energy decreases, but still remaining too large with respect\nto the empirical value, while the saturation density is essentially unchanged.
