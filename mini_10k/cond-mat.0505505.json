For a pristine surface the energies of Shockley surface states lie in the 'gap' around the L-point\nof the bulk Brillouin Zone, their wavefunctions being\nconfined to the surface. The corresponding dispersion\nrelations ave been determined by ARPES and were\nfound to be two-dimensional free\u2013electron like parabolas [1, 2, 6]. One of the highly interesting features of this\nphenomenon is the response to perturbations causes by\nplacing, e.g., adatoms on the surface. As to be expected\nsuch a response is characterized by long range Friedel\nlike charge oscillations governed by the dispersion relation of the two-dimensional surface electron gas. The\nexistence of long range interactions between adatoms on\nsurfaces supporting surface states can lead to the formation of an atomic superlattice as recently shown both\nexperimentally[7] and theoretically [10]. Until recently\nSTM studies of atoms on well defined Cu, Ag and Au\n(111) surfaces imaged only the charge distribution of the\nsurface electrons [3, 4, 5]. Remarkable developments in\nspin polarized STM [11], however, are expected to detect\nspatial variations in the magnetic density, which in turn\nmight provide an understanding of the magnetic behavior of this kind of systems [12, 13, 14, 15]. Evidently, this\nalso opens up the possibility of designing magnetic nanostructures for both scientific and technological purposes.\nIn accordance with a theoretical prediction by Borisov\net al. [16], by using STM at 7 K, Limot et al. [17]\nvery recently reported on an adatom-induced localization\n\nof the surface states electrons on Cu(111) and Ag(111)\nsurfaces. The existence of such resonances for a single\nCu adatom was also shown theoretically by Olsson et al.\n[18] in terms of a parameter-free pseudopotential method.\nThe appearance of a peak in the density of states (DOS)\njust below the surface state band can be attributed to a\ntheorem by Simon claiming the existence of a bound state\nfor any attractive potential in two dimensions [18, 19]. It\nwas demonstrated in Ref. [17] by comparing results for Co\nand Cu adatoms on Cu(111) that the type of adsorbate\ninfluences the shape of the adatom-induced resonance.\nFor this very reason we performed a systematic study for\na series of 3d impurities (Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni and Cu) on\nCu(111) in order to identify spin-dependent features of\nthe occurring resonance.\n\nMETHOD OF CALCULATIONS\n\nWithin multiple scattering theory the electronic structure of an ensemble of non-overlapping potentials is described by the so-called scattering path operator (SPO)\nmatrix (for more details see, e.g., Ref. [20]). The SPO\nmatrix \u03c4 C that refers to a finite cluster C embedded into\na host system can be obtained from the following Dyson\nequation [21],\n\u0002\n\u0003\u22121\n\u22121\n, (1)\n\u03c4 C (E) = \u03c4 h (E) I \u2212 (t\u22121\nh (E) \u2212 tC (E))\u03c4 h (E)\nwhere th (E) and \u03c4 h (E) denote the single\u2013site scattering\nmatrix and the SPO matrix for the unperturbed host\nconfined to sites in C, respectively, while tC denotes the\nsingle\u2013site scattering matrices of the embedded atoms.\nNote, that Eq. (1) takes into account all scattering events\nboth inside and outside the cluster.\n\n\f2\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\ntions do not include structural defects (e.g., steps) at\nthe surface, electron-electron interaction beyond the density functional theory or electron-phonon interaction, the\nrather broad onset of the surface-state band is a direct\nconsequence of using an imaginary part of 5 mRyd for the\nenergy when calculating the DOS, see the solid line on\nthe right of Fig. 1. In order to justify this argument, only\nfor this particular case, we also performed calculations\nwith imaginary parts of 2, 1 and 0.5 mRyd displayed in\nFig. 1 in terms of dash-dotted, dashed and dotted lines,\nrespectively. As can be seen, by decreasing the imaginary part of the energy the onset of the surface-band\napproaches a step-like behavior. The experimental onset\n(\u223c 30 meV [17]) is fairly well recovered in case of 1 mRyd\nfor the imaginary part. It should be noted that, in order to smooth out spurious oscillations in the calculated\ndensity of the surface states, in this case a sampling of\nmore then 50 000 kk points within the irreducible wedge\nof the SBZ (about 2000 kk points for |kk | < 0.15) was\nneeded, see also a recent theoretical STM study of Hofer\nand Garcia-Lekue [25]. Fortunately, however, applying\na Lorentzian broadening of 5 mRyd (\u223c 70 meV) for the\nDOS turned out to be sufficient to resolve the adatom\ninduced surface states to be studied in this paper.\n0.01\n0.00\nE-EF (Ryd)\n\nFirst, a fully self\u2013consistent (SC) calculation is performed for the Cu(111) surface by means of the screened\nKorringa\u2013Kohn\u2013Rostoker (SKKR) method [22]. Then\nfor single adatoms placed on top of Cu(111) the multiple\nscattering problem is solved self\u2013consistently in terms of\nthe embedding method discussed in details in Ref. [21].\nThe selfconsistent calculations for both the semi-infinite\nCu(111) host and the adatoms were performed using the\natomic sphere approximation (ASA) and the local spin\u2013\ndensity approximation in the parameterization of Vosko\net al. [23]. Due to the fully relativistic treatment applied\nthe orientation of the effective magnetic field had to be\nspecified: it was chosen to point along the z axis (normal to the surface). In order to evaluate the inevitable\nBrillouin-zone integrations, in the selfconsistent calculations 70 kk \u2013points were used in the irreducible wedge of\nthe surface Brillouin-zone (SBZ). For the calculation of\nthe t\u2013matrices and for the multipole expansion of the\ncharge densities, necessary to evaluate the Madelung potentials, a cut\u2013off of lmax = 2 was assumed. Energy\nintegrations were performed by sampling 16 points on a\nsemicircular contour in the complex energy plane according to an asymmetric Gaussian quadrature. The densities\nof states were calculated parallel to the real energy axis\nwith an imaginary part of 5 mRyd by sampling about\n2200 kk points within the irreducible wedge of the SBZ.\nIn the present calculations no attempt was made to include surface relaxations: the geometry was taken to be\nidentical to an ideal Cu bulk fcc lattice (lattice constant\na0 = 3.614 \u00c5).\n\n-0.01\n-0.02\n0.5 mRyd\n1 mRyd\n2 mRyd\n5 mRyd\n\n-0.03\n-0.04\n\nIn order to determine the dispersion relation and the\neffective mass of the surface electrons Bloch-spectral functions (BSF) [24] were evaluated in terms of the SKKR\nmethod for k-points between the \u0393\u0304 and K\u0304 points in the\nfcc(111) SBZ close to the Fermi energy. It should be\nrecalled that the dispersion relation of the surface state\nband can be defined by the position of the maxima in\nthe BSF. In agreement with experiments the calculated\ndispersion relation is a free\u2013electron like parabola as indicated in Fig. 1. The bottom of the calculated surface state band is only about 0.3 eV below the Fermi\nenergy which is a bit smaller than the experimental values (0.4 eV) [2, 6]. Also in good agreement with the\nexperimental data [2] is the corresponding effective mass\nm\u2217 = 0.37 me as obtained using an appropriate fitting\nprocedure. In Fig. 1 also the density of the surface states\nin the vicinity of the band-edge is displayed. Shown is\nthe s-like DOS of the first vacuum (empty sphere) layer\nas integrated over a sphere of a radius of 0.15/a.u. centered around \u0393\u0304 of the SBZ.

The widths and positions with respect to the surface state band edge of the\nadatom-induced peak agrees well with the one obtained\nin Ref. [18]. The calculated resonance width being also in\nagreement with Ref. [18] is, however, approximately three\ntimes larger than experimentally measured [17]. This disagreement with the experiment can most probably be attributed again to the rather large Lorentzian broadening\nof the calculated DOS.\n\nd-DOS (1/Ryd)\n\n3.0\n\nThe fairly narrow d -band of the Cu adatom lies well\nbelow the 2D surface band (Ed \u2248 \u22120.1 Ryd). It can\ntherefore be assumed that the adatom-induced resonance\nat E \u2248 \u22120.025 Ryd is hardly influenced by d \u2013like states.\nThis allows us to consider the Cu adatom as a reference when identifying effects of d -states on the adatominduced resonance in the case of other impurities. In line\nwith Ref. [18], a peak in the s\u2013DOS of the Cu adatom\ncan be observed just at the peak position of the d -band.\nThis is a direct consequence of the hybridization between\ns and d type atomic orbitals as illustrated in Fig. 3 using group theoretical arguments. It is important to note\nthat in order to make use of a well-defined non-relativistic\nclassification of the densities of states in terms of symmetry adapted spherical harmonics, only in this case we\n\"switched off\" the spin-orbit coupling by applying the\nso-called scaling scheme proposed by Ebert et al. [27].\nIn the upper panel of this figure the d \u2013DOS is decomposed into three components: two of them corresponding to the two\u2013dimensional irreducible representation (E)\nof the C3v point\u2013group, namely, according to the following sets of symmetrized basis functions {dxy , dx2 \u2212y2 } and\n{dxz , dyz }, and one to a one-dimensional representation\n(A1 ), namely, with respect to {dz2 }. Clearly enough, the\ns-states that correspond to A1 symmetry can hybridize\nonly with dz2 \u2013states as is apparent from the line\u2013shapes\nof the corresponding DOS's in Fig. 3.\n\n40\n\nxy,x2-y2\nxz,yz\nz2\n\n20\n0\n\ns-DOS (1/Ryd)\n\nwithin a relativistic description the electronic spin is not\na constant of motion. In the present cases, however, characterized by large exchange splittings and weak spin-orbit\ninteractions it is quite illustrative to view the two spin\u2013\nchannels separately by making use of the approximation\ndiscussed in Ref. [26].\n\n1\n\n0\n-0.14\n\n-0.12\n-0.1\nE-EF (Ryd)\n\n-0.08\n\nFIG. 3: Upper panel: Calculated d\u2013DOS of a single Cu\nimpurity on a Cu(111) surface as partitioned into dxz , dyz ,\ndxy , dz 2 and dx2 \u2212y 2 like contributions. Lower panel: s\u2013\nDOS at the same site. The DOS's presented in this figure\ncorrespond to one of the spin\u2013projections.\n\nFrom Fig. 2 the appearance of the adatom-induced localized state is also obvious in the case of the magnetic\nimpurities as only a slight variation of its position in en-\n\n\f4\n\nDOS (arb. units)\n\ntween the surface states and the d-states of an adatom.\n\n1\n2\n3\n7\n11\n\nDOS (arb. units)\n\nergy occurs. This indicates that each kind of impurity\nacts in a similar manner as an attractive potential well\nfor the 2D electron gas. As can be seen, however, in\nthe case of magnetic adatoms the shape of the adatominduced resonance is different for the two spin projections. This observation can be well explained in terms of\nthe energetic position of the corresponding d-bands of the\nimpurities. For Mn, Fe and also for Co the majority d band lies reasonably deep below the adatom-induced resonance. Therefore, the line shape of one (say majority)\nspin\u2013projected s\u2013DOS around E = \u22120.025 Ryd is practically unchanged as compared to the Cu case. Within\nthe energy range displayed, an s-d hybridized peak in\nthe majority s\u2013DOS is seen for Co around -0.09 Ryd.\nAn analysis in terms of symmetry-adapted spherical harmonics (basis functions) as discussed in the case of the\nCu adatom applies also in this case. For Cr and Ni the\nposition of the majority d -band is just at the bottom\nof surface band. The adatom-induced resonance appears\ntherefore for Ni just as a small shoulder on the upper side\nof the s-d hybridized peak, while for Cr the resonance can\nhardly be traced at all.\nFor all magnetic adatoms investigated the minority dband overlaps with the 2D surface state band. In the\nseries Cr to Ni its position moves downwards in energy,\nits width decreases monotonously. For Mn and Fe a moderately well-developed peak can be seen at the position\nof the very sharp d\u2013band, while for Co and Ni just a\nsmall 'hump' in the minority s\u2013DOS is visible. The occurrence of these structures is of similar origin as the\ns-d hybridized peaks in the majority spin channel: the\ncontinuum-states experience resonant scattering due to\nan overlap with an adatom's d orbitals giving thus rise\nto well\u2013known virtual bound state resonances. As can\nbe shown in terms of a non-interacting Anderson model,\nthis effect is proportional to the DOS of the continuum\nband, which decreases if the position of the d-band moves\ntowards the bottom of the surface band. This explains\nqualitatively the trend for the width of the minority dband. It is, however, apparent that the minority spin\nadatom-induced resonance peak (E \u2248 \u22120.025 Ryd) is\nconsiderably larger for Co and Ni as for Cu, a fact which\nmight be attributed to a strengthening of the localization\nof the 2D surface electrons due to d\u2013like virtual bound\nstates very close in energy.\nIn Fig. 4 the s\u2013DOS for both spin directions is shown\nfor a site at selected distances measured with respect to\nan Fe adatom in the same plane (parallel to the surface).\nIt can be observed that the line shapes related to the\nadatom-induced resonance and the minority spin resonant scattering vanish in fact at a radius of about two in\nunits of the 2D (in plane) lattice constant. Beyond this\nradius a lineshape characteristic for the 2D surface\u2013state\nband appears to evolve, however, with a broader onset\nthan for the pristine Cu(111) surface. This broadening\ncan again be attributed to the interaction (overlap) be-\n\n-0.05\n\n0\n0.05\nE-EF (Ryd)\n\n0.1\n\nFIG. 4: Calculated minority spin (upper panel) and majority\nspin (lower panel) s\u2013DOS's at a site in the same plane as a\nsingle Fe impurity on a Cu(111) surface with respect to the\ndistance between these two sites.

In agreement with previous theoretical [18] and\nexperimental [17] studies the appearance of an adatominduced resonance just below the surface state band edge\nis shown. The occurrence of an additional peak in the s\u2013\nDOS caused by the adatom's dz2 -states was found below the adatom-induced resonance not only for a Cu\nadatom [18] but also for magnetic adatoms in the majority spin channel. We also found evidence of an interaction of the minority spin d-states of the magnetic\nimpurities and the surface state continuum, that for Co\nand Ni possibly explains the remarkable enhancement of\nthe adatom-induced resonance peak in the minority spin\nchannel. The different shape of the adatom-induced resonance for Cu and Co was indeed observed in experiments\n[17] and is in qualitative agreement with our calculations.\nFinally, we pointed out the existence of long\u2013range spin\u2013\npolarized oscillations of the surface states around a magnetic impurity being the very origin of a 2D RKKY interaction.\nFinancial support was provided by the Center for Computational Materials Science (Contract No. GZ 45.531,\nGZ 98.366), the Austrian Science Foundation (Contract\nNo. W004), the Hungarian Research and Technological Innovation Council and the Bundesministerium f\u00fcr\nAuswertige Angelegenheiten of Austria (Contract No. A-\n\n[1] P.
