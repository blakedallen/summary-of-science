The data\nalso include the kinematic region where three-nucleon correlations are expected to dominate.\nPACS numbers: 13.60.-r, 25.30.Fj\n\nA complete understanding of the complex structure of\nnuclei is one of the major goals of nuclear physics. Significant progress has been made over the past decade,\nyielding ab initio techniques for calculating the structure\nof light nuclei based on the nucleon-nucleon (and threenucleon) interactions [1, 2], along with methods that extend to heavier nuclei. One of the least understood aspects of nuclei is their short-range structure, where nucleons are close together and interact via the poorlyconstrained repulsive core of the N\u2013N interaction, yielding high-momentum nucleons. Measurements of scattering from these high-momentum nucleons provides direct\naccess to the short-range structure of nuclei [3\u20135].\nThis regime can be accessed through inclusive\nquasielastic (QE) scattering in which a virtual photon\nof energy \u03bd and momentum ~\nq is absorbed on a nucleon.\n\nElastic scattering from a nucleon at rest is kinematically\nwell defined and corresponds to x \u2261 Q2 /2MN \u03bd = 1,\nwhere MN is the nucleon mass and Q2 = q 2 \u2212 \u03bd 2 . For\nQE scattering from a nucleon moving in the nucleus, the\ncross section is peaked around x = 1 and has a width\ncharacterized by the Fermi momentum (kF ) with tails\nthat extend to higher momenta. Inclusive scattering at\nhigh Q2 minimizes final-state interactions while low energy transfer suppresses inelastic contributions. Thus,\ninclusive scattering at large Q2 and low \u03bd, corresponding\nto x > 1, provides relatively clean isolation of scattering\nfrom high-momentum nucleons. We present new measurements in this kinematic region for a range of light and\nheavy nuclei which expose the high-momentum, shortdistance structure in nuclei.\nExperiment E02-019 was performed in Hall C at Jef-\n\n\f2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n2\n\u03bd + MA \u2212 \u01ebs = (MN\n+ (q + y)2 ) 2 + (MA\u22121\n+ y 2 ) 2 , (1)\n\nwhere MA and MA\u22121 are the masses of the target and\nspectator (A-1) nuclei and \u01ebs is the minimum separation\nenergy. This corresponds to the minimum initial momentum of the struck nucleon. The scaling function F (y, Q2 )\nis extracted from the cross section,\nq\nd2 \u03c3\n[Z\u03c3p + N \u03c3n ]\u22121\n1 ,\n2\nd\u03a9d\u03bd\n(MN + (y + q)2 ) 2\n(2)\nand it has be shown that F (y, Q2 ) depends only on y\nat large Q2 values for a wide range of nuclei and momenta [10, 11]. Further, if the assumption of scattering\nwith an unexcited (A-1) spectator is correct, then F (y)\nis related to the nucleon momentum distribution, n(k):\ndF (k)\ndk \u2248 \u22122\u03c0kn(k).\nFigure 1 shows the momentum distribution determined\nfrom the new E02-019 data on the deuteron where we\nhave taken \u03c3p and \u03c3n to be the off-shell (cc1) cross sections as developed in Ref. [15] using parameterizations\nof the neutron [16] and proton [17] form factors. Because the inelastic contribution can become significant\nF (y, Q2 ) =\n\n3\n\nParis\nNijmegen\nArgonne V14\n2\n\u03b8=18\u00b0, <Q > \u2248 2.7\n2\n\u03b8=22\u00b0, <Q > \u2248 3.8\n2\n\u03b8=26\u00b0, <Q > \u2248 4.8\n2\n\u03b8=32\u00b0, <Q > \u2248 6.4\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n1\n\n-3\n\nn(k) [1/GeV ]\n\nferson Lab (JLab). A continuous wave electron beam\nof 5.766 GeV at currents of up to 80 \u03bcA impinged on\ntargets of 2 H, 3 He, 4 He, Be, C, Cu, and Au. Scattered\nelectrons were detected using the High Momentum Spectrometer (HMS) for electron scattering angles \u03b8e = 18\u25e6 ,\n22\u25e6 , 26\u25e6 , 32\u25e6 , 40\u25e6 , and 50\u25e6 . A detailed description of the\nmeasurement and the analysis is available in Refs. [6, 7].\nMost of the significant uncertainties are discussed in\nRef. [6], but for the very large x data used in this analysis,\nsome corrections become more significant. For the cryogenic targets, contributions from scattering in the aluminum endcaps of the target can be large, up to \u223c50% for\nthe 3 He target. This is subtracted using measurements\nfrom an aluminum \"dummy\" target, after corrections are\nmade for the difference in radiation lengths between the\nreal and dummy targets. A systematic uncertainty equal\nto 3% of the subtraction is included to account for uncertainties in the knowledge of the relative thickness of\nthe targets. The cross sections were also corrected for\nCoulomb effects (up to 10% for gold) using the effective\nmomentum approximation (EMA) calculation of Ref. [8].\nWe apply a conservative 20% systematic uncertainty to\nthis correction to account for uncertainty in the EMA.\nThe uncertainty due to possible offsets in the beam energy or spectrometer kinematics is <\n\u223c5% in the cross sections for x < 2, but <\n\u223c2% in the target ratios.\nInclusive cross sections at x > 1 are often analyzed\nusing y-scaling [4, 5, 9, 10]. For high-Q2 quasielastic\nscattering with no final-state interactions (FSIs), the inclusive cross section reduces to a product of the electron\u2013\nnucleon elastic cross sections, \u03c3eN , and a scaling function,\nF (y, Q2 ). We determine y from energy conservation:\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n0\n\n0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9\nk [GeV/c]\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) Extracted deuteron momentum distribution (points) and calculations (curves) using three different\nN\u2013N potentials [12\u201314]. Note that the Paris and Av14 calculations are nearly indistinguishable on this scale.\n\nfor small k and large Q2 , we exclude the two largest Q2\nsettings and limit the remaining data to regions where\nthe estimated inelastic contribution <\n\u223c5%. We find that\nthe extracted momentum distribution is Q2 independent,\nalthough our direct limits on the Q2 dependence are\nroughly 20\u201330% for k \u2264 300 MeV/c, increasing to \u223c40%\nat 400 MeV/c and \u223c80% at 600 MeV/c. The limits on\nthe Q2 dependence at our higher Q2 values, as well as\nthe agreement with calculations up to k \u2248 600 MeV/c,\nsupport the idea that the FSI contributions are much\nsmaller than at low Q2 values, where they can increase\nthe PWIA cross section by a factor of 2-3 or more [11, 18\u2013\n20]. The excess in the extracted momentum distribution at k \u2248 0.3 GeV/c is present in several previous\nextractions from both inclusive and D(e,e'p) measurements [4, 21].\nWhile the y-scaling criteria appear to be satisfied for\nthe deuteron, the assumption of an unexcited spectator\nin Eq. 1 breaks down for heavier nuclei. In the deuteron,\nthe spectator is a single nucleon while for heavier nuclei, the final state can involve breakup or excitations\nof the spectator (A-1) system, especially in the case of\nscattering from a pre-existing SRC which should yield\na high-momentum spectator in the final state. There\nhave been many attempts to correct for this effect via a\nmodification of the scaling variable [5, 22\u201327] or by calculation of an explicit correction to the scaling function\nusing a spectral function to account for the excitation\nof the residual system [27, 28] which provide improved\nbut model-dependent extractions of n(k). We can avoid\nthis model dependence by making comparisons between\nnuclei in a region where the kinematics limit the scattering to k > kF [5, 29]. If these high-momentum compo-\n\n\f3\nnents are related to two-nucleon short range correlations\n(2N-SRCs), where two nucleons have a large relative momentum but a small total momentum due to their hard\ntwo-body interaction, then they should yield the same\nhigh-momentum tail whether in a heavy nucleus or a\ndeuteron.\nThe first detailed study of SRCs combined data interpolated to fixed kinematics from different experiments at SLAC [29]. A plateau was seen in the ratio (\u03c3A /A)/(\u03c3D /2) that was roughly A independent for\nA \u2265 12, but smaller for 3 He and 4 He. Measurements\nfrom Hall B at JLab showed similar plateaus [30, 31] in\nA/3 He ratios for Q2 \u2265 1.4 GeV2 . A previous JLab Hall\nC experiment at 4 GeV [11, 32] measured scattering from\nnuclei and deuterium at larger Q2 values than SLAC or\nCLAS, but had limited statistics for deuterium.

For x > 1.5, the data show the expected plateau, although the point at x = 1.95 is always\nhigh because one is approaching the kinematic threshold\nfor scattering from the deuteron at x = MD /Mp \u2248 2.\nThis rise was not observed in previous measurements;\nthe SLAC data did not have sufficient statistics to see\nthe rise, while the CLAS measurements took ratios of\nheavy nuclei to 3 He, where the cross section does not go\nto zero for x \u2192 2. Table I gives the ratio in the plateau\nregion for a range of nuclei at all Q2 values where there\nwere sufficient large-x data. We apply a cut in x to isolate the plateau region, although the onset of scaling in\nx varies somewhat with Q2 . The start of the plateau is\nindependent of Q2 when taken as a function of \u03b12n ,\n\u03b12n = 2 \u2212\n\n\u03bd \u2212 q + 2MN\n1+\n2MN\n\nq\n\u0001\n2 /W 2\n1 \u2212 MN\n2n ,\n\n(3)\n\nThere are small inelastic contributions at the higher Q2\nvalues, even for x > 1.5. A simple convolution model [7]\npredicts an inelastic contribution of 1\u20133% at 18\u25e6 and 5\u2013\n10% at 26\u25e6 . This may explain the small systematic Q2\ndependence in the extracted ratios seen in Tab. I. Further\nresults on the role of SRCs will be based on the 18\u25e6 data,\nwith the inelastic contributions subtracted (including a\n100% model dependence uncertainty), to minimize the\nsize and uncertainty of the inelastic correction.\nCalculations of inclusive FSIs generally show them to\ndecrease rapidly with increasing Q2 . However, the effects\ncan still be important at high Q2 for x > 1. While at least\none calculation suggests that the FSI is A dependent [33],\nmost indicate that the FSI contributions which do not\ndecrease rapidly with Q2 are limited to FSI between the\nnucleons in the initial-state SRC [3, 5, 29, 34\u201336]. In this\ncase, the FSI corrections are identical for 2N-SRCs in the\ndeuteron or heavy nuclei, and cancel when taking the ratios. Our y-scaling analysis of the deuteron cross sections\n(Fig 1) suggests that the FSIs are relatively small for the\ndeuteron, and the ratios shown in Tab. I have only a small\nQ2 dependence, consistent with the estimated inelastic\ncontributions, supporting the standard assumption that\nany FSIs in the plateau region largely cancel in taking\nthe target ratios.\nIn the absence of large FSI effects, the cross section ratio \u03c3A /\u03c3D yields the strength of the high momentum tail\nof the momentum distribution in nucleus A relative to a\ndeuteron. If the high-momentum contribution comes entirely from quasielastic scattering from a nucleon in an n\u2013\np SRC at rest, then this ratio represents the contribution\n\n\f4\nof 2N-SRCs to the nuclear wavefunction, relative to the\ndeuteron, R2N (A, D). However, the distribution of the\nhigh-momentum nucleons in the SRC will be modified by\nthe motion of the pair in the nucleus. We use the convolution calculation and realistic parameterizations for the\nCM motion and for SRC distributions from Ref. [36] to\ncalculate this smearing and find that it generates an enhancement of the high-momentum tail of approximately\n20% for Iron and roughly scales with the size of the total pair momentum. To obtain R2N (A, D), we use the\ninelastic-subtracted cross section ratios and remove the\nsmearing effect of the center-of-mass (CM) motion of the\n2N-SRC pairs. The 20% correction for iron is scaled to\nthe other nuclei based on the A dependence of the pair\nmotion. To first order, the CM motion \"smears out\"\nthe high-momentum tail (which falls off roughly exponentially), producing an overall enhancement of the ratio in\nthe plateau region. In a complete calculation, the correction can also have some small x dependence in this region\nwhich can potentially distort the shape of the ratio. However, both the data and recent calculations [22, 37, 38]\nsuggest that any x dependence of the ratio in this region is relatively small. When removing the effect of the\nCM motion, we apply an uncertainty equal to 30% of\nthe calculated correction (50% for 3 He) to account for\nthe overall uncertainty in calculating the smearing effect,\nthe uncertainty in our assumed A-dependence of the effect, and the impact of the neglected x-dependence on\nthe extracted ratio.\nTABLE II: Extracted values of R2N (A) from this work and\nthe SLAC [29] and CLAS [31] data, along with the CM motion\ncorrection factor FCM we apply: R2N (A) = r(A, D)/FCM .\nThe SLAC and CLAS results have been updated to be consistent with the new extraction except for the lack of Coulomb\ncorrection and inelastic subtraction (see text for details).\nA\nR2N (E02-019)\nSLAC\nCLAS\nFCM\nHe\n1.93\u00b10.10\n1.8\u00b10.3\n\u2013\n1.10\u00b10.05\n4\nHe\n3.02\u00b10.17\n2.8\u00b10.4\n2.80\u00b10.28 1.19\u00b10.06\nBe\n3.37\u00b10.17\n\u2013\n\u2013\n1.16\u00b10.05\nC\n4.00\u00b10.24\n4.2\u00b10.5\n3.50\u00b10.35 1.19\u00b10.06\nCu(Fe)\n4.33\u00b10.28\n(4.3\u00b10.8) (3.90\u00b10.37) 1.20\u00b10.06\nAu\n4.26\u00b10.29\n4.0\u00b10.6\n\u2013\n1.21\u00b10.06\n2\n2\n2\n2\nhQ i\n\u223c2.7 GeV\n\u223c1.2 GeV \u223c2 GeV\nxmin\n1.5\n\u2013\n1.5\n\u03b1min\n1.275\n1.25\n1.22\u20131.26\n\n\"isoscalar\" correction applied in the previous works. This\ncorrection was based on the assumption that the highmomentum tails would have greater neutron contributions for N>Z nuclei, but the dominance of isosinglet\npairs [2, 39] implies that the tail will have equal proton and neutron contributions. The CLAS ratios are\nsomewhat low compared to the other extractions, which\ncould be a result of the lower \u03b1min values. If \u03b12n is not\nhigh enough to fully isolate 2N-SRCs, one expects the\nextracted ratio will be somewhat smaller. Note that the\nprevious data do not include corrections or uncertainties\nassociated with inelastic contributions or Coulomb distortion, which is estimated to be up to 6% for the CLAS\niron data and similar for the lower Q2 SLAC data.\nPrevious extractions of the strength of 2N-SRCs found\na slow increase of R2N with A in light nuclei, with little apparent A dependence for A\u226512. The additional\ncorrections applied in our extraction of 2N-SRC contributions do not modify these basic conclusions, but these\ncorrections, along with the improved precision in our extraction, furnishes a more detailed picture of the A dependence. In a mean-field model, one would expect the\nfrequency for two nucleons to be close enough together\nto form an 2N-SRC to be proportional to the average\ndensity of the nucleus [3]. However, while the density\nof 9 Be is similar to 3 He, yet its value of R2N is much\ncloser to that of the denser nuclei 4 He and 12 C, demonstrating that the SRC contributions do not simply scale\nwith density. This is very much like the recently observed A dependence of the EMC effect [40], where 9 Be\nwas found to behave like a denser nucleus due to its significant cluster structure. It seems natural that cluster\nstructure would be important in the short-range structure and contribution of SRCs in nuclei, but this is the\nfirst such experimental observation.\n5\n\n3\n\nCLAS\nE02-019\n\n(\u03c3He4/4)/(\u03c3He3/3)\n\n4\n3\n\nR(4He/3He)\n2\n1\n0\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\nx\n\nAfter correcting the measured ratios for the enhancement due to motion of the pair, we obtain R2N , given\nin Tab.

For\nx > 2.2, the uncertainties in the 3 He cross section are large\nenough that a one-sigma variation of these results yields an\nasymmetric error band in the ratio. The error bars shown for\nthis region represent the central 68% confidence level region.\n\n\f5\nFor A/3 He ratios above x = 2, one expects the 2N-SRC\ncontributions to become small enough that 3N-SRCs may\neventually dominate. 2N-SRCs are isolated by choosing x\nand Q2 such that the minimum initial momentum of the\nstruck nucleon is larger than kF [29], but it is not clear\nwhat kinematics are required to sufficiently suppress 2NSRC contributions [5], and larger Q2 values may be required to isolate 3N-SRCs. Figure 3 shows the 4 He/3 He\nratio at \u03b8e =18\u25e6, along with the CLAS ratios [31] (leaving\nout their isoscalar correction). The ratios in the 2N-SRC\nregion are in good agreement. Even with the large uncertainties, it is clear that our ratio at x > 2.25 is significantly higher than in the CLAS measurement. On the\nother hand, a similar analysis using preliminary results\nfrom SLAC (Fig. 8.3 from Ref. [34]) found a 4 He/3 He\ncross section ratio that is independent of Q2 between 1.0\nand 2.4 GeV2 and falls in between our result and the\nCLAS data. A recently completed experiment [41] will\nmap out the x and Q2 dependence in the 3N-SRC region\nwith high precision.\nIn summary, we have presented new, high-Q2 measurements of inclusive scattering from nuclei at x > 1. We\nexamined the high-momentum tail of the deuteron momentum distribution and used target ratios at x > 1 to\nexamine the A and Q2 dependence of the contribution of\n2N-SRCs. The SRC contributions are extracted with improved statistical and systematic uncertainties and with\nnew corrections that account for isoscalar dominance and\nthe motion of the pair in the nucleus. The 9 Be data show\na significant deviation from predictions that the 2N-SRC\ncontribution should scale with density, presumably due\nto strong clustering effects. At x > 2, where 3N-SRCs\nare expected to dominate, our A/3 He ratios are significantly higher than the CLAS data and suggest that contributions from 3N-SRCs in heavy nuclei are larger than\npreviously believed.\nWe thank the JLab technical staff and accelerator division for their contributions.
