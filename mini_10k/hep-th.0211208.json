The topic of little\ngroup was a personal favorite of Prof. Wigner. During the last years of his life, he wrote a series\nof seven papers in collaboration with Y. S. Kim elaborating the geometrical meaning of the\nlittle group [2]. Meanwhile there were also studies regarding gauge generating aspects of the\nlittle group [3, 4]. Recently, we have found some more interesting and hitherto unknown facets\nof the little group in generating the gauge transformations in various abelian gauge theories,\nincluding topologically massive ones [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. In this talk, I describe our work in this\ndirection, highlighting the major results2 . Further details can be found from the references\ngiven.\nWigner's little group is defined as the subgroup of homogeneous Lorentz group that leaves\nthe energy-momentum vector of a particle invariant: W \u03bc \u03bd k \u03bd = k \u03bc . In 3+1 dimensions, the little\ngroup for a massive particle is the rotation group SO(3). On the other hand, for a massless\nparticle, the little group is the Euclidean group E(2) which is a semi-direct product of SO(2)\nand T (2) - the group of translations in the 2-dimensional plane. As is well known, both the\nrotational groups SO(3) and SO(2) determine the classification of particles on the basis of\n1\n\nInvited talk at the Wigner Centennial Conference held at Pecs, Hungary, July 8- 12, 2002. e-mail: rabin@bose.res.in; rabin@post.kek.jp\n2\nNotation: Greek alphabets \u03bc, \u03bd etc denote the space-time indices in 3+1 dimensions, letters a, b, c etc\nstands for 2+1 dimensions and those from the middle of the alphabet, i.e. i, j, k etc stands for 4+1 dimensions.\n\n1\n\n\ftheir spin quantum numbers. One can obtain the little group E(2) as a particular limit of the\nrotation group SO(3) by Inonu-Wigner group contraction. However, while the significance of\nrotational groups was evident, the role of translational group remained a mystery for a long\ntime. Weinberg and Han et. al. [3, 4] noticed that the translational group acts as a gauge\ngenerator in Maxwell theory. Following Weinberg [3], one can find the explicit representation\nof Wigner's little group which leaves invariant the 4-momentum k \u03bc = (\u03c9, 0, 0, \u03c9)T of a photon\nof energy \u03c9 moving in the z-direction, to be W4 (p, q; \u03c6) = W (p, q)R(\u03c6), where\n\uf8eb\n\nW (p, q) = W4 (p, q; 0) =\n\n1+\n\np2 +q 2\n2\n\np\nq\n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\np2 +q 2\n2\n\np\n1\n0\np\n\n2\n\n2\n\nq \u2212 p +q\n2\n0\n\u2212p\n1\n\u2212q\n2\n2\nq 1 \u2212 p +q\n2\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n(1)\n\nis a particular representation of the translational subgroup T (2) of the little group and R(\u03c6)\nrepresents a SO(2) rotation about the z-axis. Note that the representations W (p, q) and R(\u03c6)\nof the translation and rotation groups satisfy the relations W (p, q)W (p\u0304, q\u0304) = W (p + p\u0304, q + q\u0304)\nand R(\u03c6)R(\u03c6\u0304) = R(\u03c6 + \u03c6\u0304).\nWe begin the discussion by showing that (1) acts as a gauge generator for the Maxwell\ntheory. The free Maxwell theory has the equation of motion \u2202\u03bc F \u03bc\u03bd = 0 which follows from\nthe Lagrangian L = \u2212 14 F\u03bc\u03bd F \u03bc\u03bd where F\u03bc\u03bd = \u2202\u03bc A\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bd A\u03bc . The gauge field A\u03bc (x) for a\nsingle mode can be written as A\u03bc (x) = \u03b5\u03bc (k)eik*x suppressing the positive frequency part\nwithout any loss of generality. In terms of the polarization vector \u03b5\u03bc , the gauge transformation\nA\u03bc (x) \u2192 A\u2032\u03bc = A\u03bc + \u2202\u03bc f (where f (x) is an arbitrary scalar function) is expressed as \u03b5\u03bc (k) \u2192\n\u03b5\u2032\u03bc = \u03b5\u03bc (k) + if (k)k\u03bc where f (x) has been written as f (x) = f (k)eik*x . The equation of motion,\nin terms of the polarization vector, will now be given by k 2 \u03b5\u03bc \u2212 k \u03bc k\u03bd \u03b5\u03bd = 0. The massive\nexcitation corresponding to k 2 6= 0 leads to the solution \u03b5\u03bc \u221d k \u03bc which can be gauged away.\nFor massless excitations (k 2 = 0), the Lorentz condition k\u03bc \u03b5\u03bc = 0 follows immediately from\nthe momentum space equation of motion. Taking k \u03bc = (\u03c9, 0, 0, \u03c9)T , corresponding to a photon\nof energy \u03c9 propagating in the z direction, and using the Lorentz condition, one can easily\nshow that \u03b5\u03bc (k) is gauge equivalent to the maximally reduced form3 \u03b5\u03bc (k) = (0, \u03b51 , \u03b52, 0)T\ndisplaying the two transverse degrees of freedom corresponding to \u03b51 and \u03b52 . Under the action\n\u03bc\nof the translational group\u0010 T (2) in\n\u0011 (1), this polarization vector transforms as follows: \u03b5 \u2192\n1\n2\n\u03b5\u2032\u03bc = W \u03bc \u03bd (p, q)\u03b5\u03bd = \u03b5\u03bc + p\u03b5 +q\u03b5\nk \u03bc . It is now obvious that, this can be identified as a gauge\n\u03c9\ntransformation by choosing f (k) suitably. This shows that the translational subgroup T (2) of\nWigner's little group for massless particles acts as gauge generator in free Maxwell theory [3, 4].\nSimilar conclusions hold also for Kalb-Ramond theory in 3+1 dimensions [5].\nNext, consider the B \u2227 F theory, which is a topologically massive gauge theory described\n1\nby the Lagrangian L = \u2212 14 F\u03bc\u03bd F \u03bc\u03bd + 12\nH\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb H \u03bc\u03bd\u03bb \u2212 m6 \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb\u03c1 H\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb A\u03c1 based on the vector field\nA\u03bc , from which F\u03bc\u03bd is constructed and the antisymmetric tensor field B\u03bc\u03bd , which defines\nH\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb = \u2202\u03bc B\u03bd\u03bb + \u2202\u03bd B\u03bb\u03bc + \u2202\u03bb B\u03bc\u03bd .\n3\n\nThis method of obtaining the maximally reduced form of polarization vector/tensor of a theory is henceforth\ncalled the 'plane wave method'.\n\n2\n\n\fIt is invariant under the combined gauge transformations A\u03bc (x) \u2192 A\u03bc + \u2202\u03bc f and B\u03bc\u03bd \u2192\nB\u03bc\u03bd + \u2202\u03bc F\u03bd (x) \u2212 \u2202\u03bd F\u03bc (x) where f (x) and F\u03bc (x) are arbitrary functions. Employing the plane\nwave method one can show that the massless excitations of B \u2227 F theory are gauge artifacts\nand the maximally reduced form of the polarization vector and tensor corresponding to the\nmassive physical excitations are given by\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n{\u03b5\u03bc\u03bd } = \uf8ec\n\n0 0\n0\n0\n0 0\nc \u2212b \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7,\n0 \u2212c 0\na \uf8f8\n0 b \u2212a 0\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n\u03b5\u03bc = \u2212i \uf8ec\n\n0\na\nb\nc\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n(2)\n\nwith the duality relation \u03b5\u03bc\u03bd \u03b5\u03bc = 0 between them [5]. Correspondingly, the momentum vector is\np\u03bc = (m, 0, 0, 0)T . Now, unlike in the case of Maxwell and KR theories, here the representation\nW (p, q) (1) fails to be the generator of gauge transformations.\nHowever one can arrive at the representation of the group that generates gauge transformations in B \u2227 F theory by considering the action of the matrix\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\nD(p, q, r) = \uf8ec\n\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\np\n1\n0\n0\n\nq\n0\n1\n0\n\nr\n0\n0\n1\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n(3)\n\n(where p, q, r are real parameters) on the polarization vector and tensor in (2):\n\u03b5\u03bc \u2192 \u03b5\u2032\u03bc = D \u03bc \u03bd (p, q, r)\u03b5\u03bd = \u03b5\u03bc \u2212\n\ni\n(pa + qb + rc)p\u03bc\nm\n\n{\u03b5\u03bc\u03bd } \u2192 {\u03b5\u2032\u03bc\u03bd } = D(p, q, r){\u03b5\u03bc\u03bd }D T (p, q, r) = {\u03b5\u03bc\u03bd } + (\u2206\u03b5)\u03bc\u03bd\n\n(4)\n(5)\n\nwhere (\u2206\u03b5)\u03bc\u03bd = k\u03bc F\u03bd (k) \u2212 k\u03bd F\u03bc (k) and F\u03bc (k) is an arbitrary function. It is obvious that these\nreproduce the gauge transformations in the B \u2227 F theory [5].\nThe group, of which D(p, q, r) is a representation, can be found by noticing that D(p, q, r) \u00d7\nD(p\u2032 , q \u2032 , r \u2032) = D(p + p\u2032 , q + q \u2032 , r + r \u2032 ) which is the composition rule for the 3-dimensional\n, P2 = \u2202D(0,q,0)\nand P3 =\ntranslational group T (3). Moreover, the generators P1 = \u2202D(p,0,0)\n\u2202p\n\u2202q\n\u2202D(0,0,r)\n\u2202r\n\nof D(p, q, r) are the same as those of T (3) as can be seen from their Lie algebra [P1 , P2 ] =\n[P2 , P3 ] = [P3 , P1 ] = 0. Thus the gauge generator for B \u2227 F theory is the representation (3) of\nthe translational group T (3). One may also notice that there are three different embeddings of\nT (2) within T (3) and they preserve the 4-momentum of massless particles moving in the three\ndifferent spatial directions.\nNow we describe a method by which one can derive the gauge generating representation of\ntranslational group for topologically massive theories from the corresponding representation for\nordinary gauge theories living in one higher space-time dimensions. The starting point of this\ndimensional descent method is to note that one can interpret a massive particle in d-dimensions\nas a massless particle in d + 1-dimensions, with the mass being considered as the momentum\n3\n\n\fcomponent along the additional dimension [10]. In its content, dimensional descent is related\nto the Inonu-Wigner group contraction.\nFor example the momentum and polarization vectors of Maxwell theory in 5-dimensions\nare given by pi = (\u03c9, 0, 0, 0, \u03c9)T and \u03b5i = (0, a1 , a2 , a3 , 0)T . With the identification of \u03c9 with\nthe mass m and the deletion of the last columns (by the applying the projection operator\nP = diagonal(1, 1, 1, 1, 0)), these vectors respectively becomes the rest frame momentum and\npolarization vectors of Proca model in 4-dimensions which is equivalent to B \u2227 F theory [5,\n7]. The 5-dimensional analogue W5 (p, q, r) of (1) generate gauge transformations in Maxwell\ntheory in that space-time dimension [7]. That is, \u03b5\u2032i = W5 (p, q, r)i j \u03b5j = \u03b5i + pa1 +qa\u03c92 +ra3 pi .\nUsing the projection operator P one can project out the extra 5th dimension: \u03b4\u03b5\u0304\u03bc = P\u03b4\u03b5i =\npa1 +qa2 +ra3 \u03bc\np . This is precisely the gauge transformation of the polarization vector in B \u2227 F\n\u03c9\ntheory in 4-dimensions. From the form of this transformation, one can readily read off the\nmatrix representation of the group that generate the gauge transformation of the B \u2227 F theory\nin 4-dimensions to be (3). Dimensional descent from 4 to 3 dimensions yields analogous results\nfor 2+1 dimensional Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory [6, 7].\nThe above considerations are also valid for linearized gravity theories, both the usual as well\nas the topologically massive ones [8] . The role of Wigner's little group in generating the star\ngauge invariance in noncommutative gauge theories can be a possible extension of the present\nwork. It is also of interest to construct and study the equivalent of the little group in Ads\nspace where there is a novel gauge transformation connected to partially massless theories, as\nreported in [11].\nAcknowledgements: It is a pleasure to thank my collaborators, B.Chakraborty and\nT.Scaria.\n\nReferences\n[1] E.
