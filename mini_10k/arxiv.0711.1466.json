In this contribution, the word hidden\nmeans unobserved (unobservable) or invisible by the method used in the observation, rather\nthan anonymous. The invisibility of the hidden persons is caused from the limited capability\nof the observation method, or from the limited prior understanding of the targets to observe.\nThe organization may be a family, school, company, community, society etc.\nFor example, a financially supporting conspirator, who provides commanders with money,\ncommunication means, or weapons, is often hidden behind terrorism attacks. Commanders\nwould appear one after another if such a conspirator were not detected and arrested. It is,\ntherefore, critical to predict the presence of such hidden but relevant persons from the observed\nrecords on the social interactions of an organization. Based on the prediction, we can invent\na scenario for proactive investigation. The scenario turns the threat of disasters from the\nterrorism attacks into the opportunity to discover and destroy the hidden conspirator's social\nnetwork supporting terrorism.\nWe define the above problem more specifically with three ideas. They are social interaction,\nsocial network, and empty spot.\nYoshiharu MAENO\nGraduate School of Systems Management, Tsukuba University, Tokyo 1120012, Japan.\nEmail: maeno.yoshiharu@nifty.com.\nYukio OHSAWA\nSchool of Engineering, University of Tokyo, Tokyo 1138656, Japan.\nEmail: ohsawa@q.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp.\n\n\f2\n\nYoshiharu MAENO * Yukio OHSAWA\n\n\u2022 A social interaction is a dynamic influence dissemination among persons through conversation, meeting, collective action etc. Communication is of particular interest since it\noften takes place on the electronic media, which is one of the major targets of surveillance.\n\u2022 An organization can be modeled as a social network which underlies below the social\ninteraction. Nodes are persons. Links are relationship such as friendship, business partnership, chain of command etc. The links can be undirectional, unidirectional, or bidirectional. Variety of network topologies are known. A scale-free network[3] and a small-world\nnetwork[19] were studied mathematically in detail. The topology of the real networks are\ndiverse. The topologies of contemporary inter-working terrorists, self-organizing on-line\ncommunity, and purposefully organized business team do not resemble.\n\u2022 The empty spot in the social interaction is the main topic of this contribution. It refers\nto an empty hard-to-fill space, which can exist in the observed records of the social\ninteraction, and is the potential clue to the persons in the underlying social network who\ndo not appear in the records. Such hidden persons are the origin of the empty spot in a\nnutshell.\nIn this contribution, the problem we address is to discover relevant empty spots in a complex\nsocial interaction. We propose a heuristic predictor function method to predict the relevant\nempty spots and the hidden persons from communication records. The method is presented\nin detail in 4 after studying the related works in 2 and the network models (homogeneous\nand inhomogeneous network) in 3. Simulation experiment is demonstrated in 5. A test data\nset is generated in the form of market baskets as the simulated communication records over\na homogeneous network. Precision to discover the empty spots is calculated to evaluate the\nperformance of the method for three trial cases. Concluding remarks are presented in 6.\n\n2 Related Work\nThe problem is related to a node discovery problem[14],[16]. Expertise in computer and social\nsciences is significant. Complex networks such as scale-free networks (Barab\u00e1si-Albert model[3] )\nand small-world networks (Watts-Strogatz model[19] ) presented us insight on the structure and\nevolution of a large-scale network. Scientists' collaboration or actors in movies are examples.\nPower law governing the scale-free network appears from the preferential attachment of the\nnodes in a growing network. A few very big hub nodes emerge, accounting for the winnertakes-all phenomena. The small-world network is highly clustered like a regular lattice, but\nhas small diameter like a random graph. The name originates in the small-world phenomena\nknown as six degree of separation.\nSearch efficiency in a network[1] is of particular interest for practical applications. The hub\nnodes in scale-free networks are useful in designing local search strategies. The hub nodes\nimprove the efficiency to access relevant nodes. Error and attack tolerance were studied[2] .\nScale-free networks display a surprisingly high degree of tolerance against random errors. Other\nnetworks do not have such a property. The error tolerance is, however, at the expense of\nattack survivability. The network is broken into many isolated fragments when the hub nodes\nare targeted. Centrality and brokerage measures[4],[5] are convenient values summarizing the\nnetwork topology. Degree, betweenness, closeness, and eigenvector centrality are popular among\nthem. They have been studied in many cases of the social network analysis.\nEmpirical study on social networks uncovered many aspects of the criminal and terrorist\norganizations in the past and at present[17] . Intelligence sharing, knowledge management, and\n\n\fEMPTY SPOTS IN SOCIAL INTERACTION\n\n3\n\nsimulation techniques are described as well as the social network analysis. Hidden Markov\nmodel and Bayesian network are applied to predicting terrorist attacks[18]. Activities are modeled and patterns of anomalous behavior are identified. It helps intelligence analysts connect\nthe fragmented facts more quickly. P. S. Keila et al. applied factor analysis (singular value\ndecomposition and semi-discrete decomposition) to study email exchange in an American energy company, Enron Corporation, which ended in bankruptcy due to the institutionalized\naccounting fraud in 2001[7]. The word use in the emails is correlated to the function within the\norganization. The word use among those involved in the alleged criminal activity is distinctive.\nCriminal organizations tend to be strings of inter-linked small groups that lack a central\nleader but coordinate their activities along logistic trails and through bonds of friends, and that\nhypothesis can be built by paying attention to remarkable white spots and hard-to-fill positions\nin a network[8]. The white spots and hard-to-fill positions in the observed social interactions\ncorrespond to the empty spots in this contribution. V. E. Krebs investigated the 9/11 terrorist\nnetwork in 2001[9] . It reveals the relevance of conspirators who reduce the distance between\nhijackers, enhance communication efficiently, and act as a conduit for money and knowledge.\nThe 9/11 terrorist network was also investigated[15] from the viewpoint of efficiency and security\ntrade-off by analyzing the change in degree, betweenness and closeness centrality measures. It is\nsuggested that more security-oriented structure arises from longer time-to-task of the terrorists'\nobjectives. Conspirators improve communication efficiency, preserving hijackers' small visibility\nand exposure.\n\n3 Network Model\nSocial network modeling[4] is a basic tool to describe an organization like a family, school,\ncompany, community, society etc. A node represents a person. A link represents relationship\nbetween two persons, which we simply assume is equal to the presence of communication between the persons. Information dissemination with the communication is a social interaction.\nAn origin of complexity of the social interaction is the complexity and variability of the underlying network topologies. Different networks describe different organizations. We can classify\nthe networks into two classes. They are inhomogeneous networks and homogeneous networks.\nThe definition is as follows. A homogeneous network refers to one that consists of the nodes\nwhich have similar local topological characteristics. The network is homogeneous when the\nvariance of the nodal degree (\u03c3(d)/\u03bc(d)) is small. The standard deviation and mean of the nodal\ndegree d are denoted by \u03c3(d) and \u03bc(d). Many random networks including an Erd\u00f6s-R\u00e9nyi model\nand a Watts-Strogatz model are homogeneous. On the other hand, an inhomogeneous network\nrefers to one that consists of the nodes which have variable local topological characteristics\n(\u03c3(d)/\u03bc(d) is large). A strong center-and-periphery structure or a leader-follower relationship\nis the indicator of an inhomogeneous network.\n3.1 Inhomogeneous network\nA typical inhomogeneous network is a scale-free network derived from a Barab\u00e1si-Albert\nmodel[3] . The scale-free network is used to describe World Wide Web, scientist's collaboration,\nactors in a movie etc. An example is illustrated in Figure 1. The network consists of |n| = 490\nnodes. Figure 2 shows the occurrence probability distribution P (d) of nodal degree[5] d. The\nhorizontal axis is normalized. It is the nodal degree divided by the average degree (d/\u03bc(d)). It\nis governed by a power low in Equation (1).\nP (d) \u221d d\u22122.1 .\n\n(1)\n\n\f4\n\nYoshiharu MAENO * Yukio OHSAWA\n\nFigure 1: Example of an inhomogeneous network consisting of |n| = 490 nodes. It is a scale-free\nnetwork governed by a power low (Barab\u00e1si-Albert model). Center-and-periphery structure is\nevident.\nThe average degree is \u03bc(d) = 3.6. The node-to-node deviation in the nodal degree is large.\nGini coefficient is also large. It indicates a center-and-periphery structure. Human eyes identify\nabout 10 big hub nodes in the figure easily. The hub nodes influence the way the network\noperates, communication disseminates, and information stored in the network is accessed. A\nself-organizing community is often inhomogeneous. A purposefully organized business team is\noften hierarchical and tends to be inhomogeneous. Relevant empty spots in such organizations\nare likely to be the hidden nodes. It is relatively easy to obtain a clue on the hidden hub nodes\nbecause of their large activeness in communication. Such a problem was studied in [12].\n3.2 Homogeneous network\nA typical homogeneous network is illustrated in Figure 3. The network consists of |n| = 995\nnodes. Figure 4 shows the occurrence probability distribution P (d) of nodal degree[5] d. It is\ngoverned by an exponential law in Equation (2).\nP (d) \u221d e\u22123.1d .\n\n(2)\n\nThe degree ranges from 3 to 8. The average degree is \u03bc(d) = 3.9. The deviation in the\ndegree is very small. It is the characteristics of the homogeneous network. A small-world\nnetwork (Watts-Strogatz model) is homogeneous compared with the Barab\u00e1si-Albert model.\nThe Watts-Strogatz model does not possess big hub nodes but short-cut links. It looks difficult\n\n\fEMPTY SPOTS IN SOCIAL INTERACTION\n\n5\n\nFigure 2: Occurrence probability distribution P (d) of the nodal degree d as a function of the\nnormalized degree d/\u03bc(d).\nto distinguish one node from another from the local topological properties such as the nodal\ndegree.\nSuch characteristics are suitable for terrorist and criminal organizations[8],[9]. Absence of\nhub nodes is disadvantageous in communication and search efficiency[1] , but advantageous in\nsecurity against exposure and detection[2],[15] . It looks a big technical challenge to obtain a\nclue on the hidden node by identifying relevant empty spots within the communication records\nobserved as a social interaction. A homogeneous network is of particular interest. This network\nis used in the simulation study in 5.\n\n4 Method\nWe present our method to discover the empty spots. We employ a heuristic predictor\nfunction which evaluates the likeliness of the individual data being an empty spot. Heuristic\npredictor function is suitable to handle a very large amount of data observed in a very large\nnetwork. The input to the method is the records D, observed for nodes. The records are the\ncollection of the data in the form of baskets in Equations (3) and (4). The content of the basket\nbj are a set of nodes ni which are observed simultaneously, or grouped under a specific subject.\nThe number of the baskets is denoted by |b|. The number of the nodes in a basket bi is denoted\nby |bi |. The number of species of the nodes is denoted by |n|.\nD = {bj } (0 \u2264 j \u2264 |b| \u2212 1).\n\n(3)\n\nbj = {ni } (0 \u2264 i \u2264 |bj | \u2212 1).\n\n(4)\n\nThe output from the method is a clue on empty spots generated by the predictor function.\nMore specifically, our aim is to identify the basket bi which is related to the empty spots (or\nthe underlying hidden persons) the most likely. The core of our method is, therefore, to design\na predictor function W (bi |D) to evaluate the likeliness of the individual baskets bi . The basket\nbi evaluated as the most likely should include the hidden node nx , and arise from the links rxj\nbetween the node nx and a gateway node nj . The gateway node is the observed node which is\na neighbor of the hidden node.\n\n\f6\n\nYoshiharu MAENO * Yukio OHSAWA\n\nFigure 3: Example of a homogeneous social network consisting of |n| = 995 nodes. The nodes\nindicated by [a] (red circle), [b] (blue), and [c] (green) are used in the simulation study in 5.\nThe node [a] has the largest nodal degree. The node [b] has the smallest standard deviation of\nthe distance to the other nodes. The node [c] has the smallest mean of the distance.\n\nFigure 4: Occurrence probability distribution P (d) of the nodal degree d as a function of the\nnormalized degree d/\u03bc(d).\n\n\f7\n\nEMPTY SPOTS IN SOCIAL INTERACTION\n\nAt first, the nodes in the observation are clustered into groups based on the inter-node\ndistance. The distance (or closeness) are defined according to the co-occurrence frequency\nbetween the nodes. Occurrence frequency of a node F (ni ) is defined by Equation (5) using a\nBoolean function B(s) for a proposition s in Equation (6).\n|b|\u22121\n\nF (ni ) \u2261\n\nX\n\nB(ni \u2208 bj ).\n\n(5)\n\nj=0\n\nB(s) =\n\n\u001a\n\n1\n0\n\nif s is TRUE\n.\notherwise\n\n(6)\n\nThe frequency is the number of the baskets where ni appears. The frequency is increased\nby 1 when ni appears once or more in a single basket. We use Jaccard's coefficient defined\nby Equation (7) as a measure of the co-occurrence. Jaccard's coefficient is used widely in link\ndiscovery, web mining, or text processing[15] . Co-occurrence frequency or dependence coefficient\nmay also be used instead of Jaccard's coefficient.\nJ(ni , nj ) \u2261\n\nF (ni \u2229 nj )\n.\nF (ni \u222a nj )\n\n(7)\n\nEquation (7) is converted into Equations (8) using Equation (5).\nP|b|\u22121\n\nJ(ni , nj ) = Pk=0\n|b|\u22121\nk=0\n\nB((ni \u2208 bk ) \u2227 (nj \u2208 bk ))\nB((ni \u2208 bk ) \u2228 (nj \u2208 bk ))\n\n.\n\n(8)\n\nWe employ k-medoid clustering algorithm[6] because the amount of necessary calculation is\nsmall. It is simple and efficient. It is an EM (expectation-maximization) algorithm similar to\nk-means algorithm for numerical data. A medoid node nmed(j) is a node locating most centrally\nwithin a cluster cj (0 \u2264 j \u2264 |c| \u2212 1). They are initially selected at random. Other |n| \u2212 |c| nodes\nare classified into the clusters based on the closeness to the medoids. The number of clusters\nis denoted by |c|. Then, a new medoid is selected within the individual cluster so that the sum\nof closeness from nodes within the cluster to the modoid is maximal. The sum of closeness\n(M (cj ) within cj ) is evaluated by Equation (9). Iteration of updating the medoid nmed(j) in\nthe cluster to maximize M (cj ) is carried out until the medoids converge. The resulting clusters\nare denoted by cj .

The homogeneous social network in Figure 3 is\nemployed as a model for the communication patterns among 995 persons. We use precision as\na measure of the performance. In information retrieval, precision has been used as evaluation\ncriteria, which is the fraction of the amount of relevant data to the amount of the all data\nreturned by search (the data ranked highly by the heuristic predictor function).\n5.1 Test data set\nThe test data set is generated in the two steps below. Note that the input communication\nrecords bi (representing the observation including the empty spot) are different from the communication patterns \u03b2i (representing the original communication). The difference, however,\ndoes not affect the communication patterns. This difference between bi and \u03b2i is the target to\npredict by our method.\n\u2022 Communication patterns are simulated and formatted into basket-shaped observation\nrecords. A basket \u03b2i includes the nodes which are close to each other. For example,\nwe can imagine a situation where a person starts talking and a conversation takes place\namong neighboring persons. The area of such influence is specified approximately with\nthe distance from a node. The distance can be measured in the number of hop count.\nOne hop is as long as one link on the network. An example basket is \u03b20 = {n954 , n1930 ,\nn3261 , n5093 , n5223 , n7743 , n7808 , . . .}, representing communication around the node n954\nin Figure 3.\n\u2022 Test data set representing observation records (with a hidden node) bi are generated by\ndeleting the nodes of interest nx from the baskets \u03b2i . The deleted nodes and the links\nconnecting them to other nodes become the hidden structure. The baskets bi are the\ninput to the predictor function W (bi |D) in Equation (10). The hidden nodes may exist\nin multiple baskets. The predictor function ranks and tries to retrieve all of bi , which are\ndifferent from the \u03b2i , as candidates including the hidden nodes and indicating the empty\nspot. The example basket \u03b20 results in b0 = {n954 , n1930 , n3261 , n5093 , n7743 , n7808 , . . .}\nwhen the node n5223 is configured to be the hidden node to predict. The baskets bi are\nlike records of email senders and receivers which lacks in persons expressing their opinions\nin the oral communication, or like records of persons of on-line chat meetings which lacks\nin persons using a satellite telephone.\nIn the simulation, we made up 995 baskets (\u03b20 to \u03b2994 ) consisting of nodes within a few\nhops from the initiator node in the 1st step. The number of nodes within 5 hops is about 20%\nof the whole nodes on average. This is a relatively long-distance communication.\n\n\fEMPTY SPOTS IN SOCIAL INTERACTION\n\n9\n\nFigure 5: Precision p for three trial cases.

The\ni\ni\nhidden nodes are either nodes around the node [a], [b], or [c] in Figure 3.\n5.2 Precision evaluation\nWe evaluate precision of the output of the method in the three trial cases. In each case, about\n10 nodes around the node labeled [a], [b], or [c] in Figure 3 are configured as the empty spot.\nThe node [a] has the largest nodal degree. The node [b] has the smallest standard deviation of\nthe distance (hop counts to travel) to the other nodes. The node [c] has the smallest mean of\nthe distance to the other nodes. The nodes [b] and [c] occupy a unique position in terms of a\nglobal network topology. They can reach most nodes in the network impartially and efficiently.\nThey are like terrorism sponsors having many (direct or indicrect) relations to the regional\nactivist groups all over the world. Note that the nodal degree is similar in a homogeneous\nnetwork (actually, 3 to 8 in Figure 3), and that the node [a] is not particularly unique though\nits degree is the largest.\nPrecision p is defined as a function of mret by Equation (12). The number of the baskets\nretrieved by the heuristic predictor function is denoted by mret . It can range from 1 to |b|.\n(0 \u2264 i \u2264 mret \u2212 1). The basket b0 is the most\nIndividual retrieved baskets are denoted by bret\ni\nlikely to include the hidden nodes. The basket b|b|\u22121 is the least likely.\nPmret \u22121\n\nB(bret\ni 6= \u03b2i )\n.\n(12)\nret\nm\nEquation (12) is the ratio of the number of correct baskets to the number of the retrieved\nbaskets. The correct baskets are those where the nodes had been deleted in the 2nd step in\n5.1. It means that if bret\n6= \u03b2i , the retrieval is correct. Precision should be 1, and decreases\ni\ngradually as mret increases if the method works properly. That is, precision is a monotonically\ndecreasing function.\np(m\n\nret\n\n)=\n\ni=0\n\n\f10\n\nYoshiharu MAENO * Yukio OHSAWA\n\nFigure 5 shows the evaluated precision p(mret ) for three trial cases. The top graph is the\ncase when nodes around the node [a] are the hidden nodes. The middle and bottom graphs\nare for the node [b] and [c]. The horizontal axis is the number of the retrieved baskets (mret ).\nThe order of the retrieved baskets is according to the largeness of the value which the predictor\nfunction outputs. Precision is very good when we try to predict the baskets in case of the nodes\n[b] and [c]. They occupy a unique position in terms of a global network topology (impartiality\nand efficiency in communication). The predictor function is suitable to discover the hidden\nnodes and related links.\nOn the other hand, precision degrades more steeply as mret increases in case of the node\n[a]. The results indicate that the method can provide relevant information on the nodes which\nare hidden but relevant globally in a homogeneous network even if their local characteristics\nlook similar. The nodes included in the retrieved baskets are likely to be the gateway nodes to\nthe hidden nodes. From this information, we may be able to make a detailed investigation plan\nfrom the gateway persons toward the hidden persons.\n\n6 Concluding Remark\nThis contribution presented a heuristic predictor function method which is suitable to predict relevant empty spots in social interaction. The empty spot refers to an empty hard-to-fill\nspace which can be found in the records of the social interaction. It is the clue to the persons\nin the underlying social network who do not appear in the records. Simulation experiment\nwas demonstrated. This contribution, in particular, focused on the social interaction in homogeneous networks, where we believe that the problem to predict the empty spots is more\ndifficult than that in inhomogeneous networks[12]. A test data set in the form of market baskets\nwas generated from the simulated communication patterns. The baskets related to the hidden\npersons could be predicted by the value of the predictor function accurately.\nThe idea of relevant empty spots in social interaction can be generalized to hidden but\nrelevant items working in a complex interacting system. We are seeking the possibility where\nsomething very new or just emerging is recognized, as well as the possibility where something\nhidden spatially is discovered. Y. Maeno et al. studied application to creative thinking[13] . An\nexperiment was carried out to see if we can invent a new technical idea from existing technical\nexpertise forest (for example, patent document database or scientific article database). Texts of\nthe patent documents for production machinery were analyzed morphologically and clustered\ninto individual technical expertise. Sensor technology, conveyer system or marking device are\nexample clusters. Participants were engineers and marketing specialists of a manufacturing\ncompany. They discussed about the identity of a new technical means (an empty spot) locating near the clusters. A few interesting and practical ideas were invented. Y. Maeno et al.\nalso studied application to designing catalyst personality fostering mutual understanding and\ncommunication among groups indicating opposing preference[11] .\nWe are combining these experiences in many application fields into a new method named\nhuman-interactive annealing[10] . It is designed to induce discovery from the difference between\nthe individual human's prior understanding of the problem, and the computer's analysis and\nvisualization of the observed data on the problem. Predicting relevant empty spots in social\ninteraction is important in crime investingation, organization design, business engineering, research and development. The method is expected to exploit many unobserved aspects of the\nsocial problems.\nReferences\n\n\fEMPTY SPOTS IN SOCIAL INTERACTION\n\n11\n\n[1] L. A. Adamic, R. M. Lukose, A. R. Puniyani, and B.
