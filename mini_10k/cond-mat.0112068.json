INTRODUCTION AND SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND\nThe idea that the properties of classical hydrodynamic turbulence can\nbe described in terms of chaotically moving thin vortex tubes appeared some\ntime ago (for a discussion and references see book by Frisch1 ). Some additional arguments in favor of that idea would be the recent direct numerical\nsimulations of flowing liquids with the Reynolds number of order 100. It\nwas shown that the vorticity field consists of a chaotic set of vortex tubes\nresembling the picture appearing in numerical simulations of the chaotic\ndynamics of quantized vortex filament in HeII2\u22124 . Of course the visual\nsimilarity cannot be considered as a confirmation of the equivalence of both\n\n\fSergey K. Nemirovskii, M. Tsubota, and T. Araki\n\npictures, therefore some quantitative analysis is required to check whether\nchaotically moving quantized vortex filaments do induce a 3D velocity field\nthat possesses statistical properties similar to that of classical turbulence.\nIn the paper we calculate the spectral density E(k) of the 3D random\nvelocity field induced by a chaotic set of quantized vortex loops. The spectrum E(k) is one of the key characteristics of turbulent motion. To calculate\nit we use the Gaussian model of a VT elaborated by one of authors earlier.5\nWe calculated spectral density E(k) for the cases of pure fractal lines with\nHaussdorf dimension HD as well as for the more realistic case of a VT in\nsuperfluid turbulent HeII.\n2. GENERAL RELATIONS\nThe average kinetic energy of the flow induced by a vortex loop can be\nevaluated as follows (see5 for details):\nE=\n\n*Z\n\n\u03c1s vs2 3\nd r\n2\n\n+\n\n=\n\nZ\nk\n\nd3 k\n4\u03c0k2\n\n*\n\n2\n\n2\u03c0\u03c1s \u03ba\n\nZL ZL\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nik(s(\u03be1 )\u2212s(\u03be2 ))\n\ns (\u03be1 )s (\u03be2 ) e\n\n+\n\nd\u03be1 d\u03be2 .\n\n0 0\n\n(1)\nHere s(\u03be) describes the vortex line position parameterized by the arclength\n\u03be, running from 0 to the length of line L, s\u2032 (\u03be) denotes the derivative with\nrespect to arclength along the line (the tangent vector). Brackets hi imply an\naveraging over all possible vortex loop configurations. Clearly, the integrand\nwithin the brackets hi in (1) is just the distribution of energy dE/dk =\n4\u03c0k2 dE/d3 k in a spherically normalized k -space.\nOf course relation (1) is just a mathematical identity - the real physical\nmeaning is hidden behind the averaging procedure. To fulfil an averaging\nprocedure one needs knowledge of the statistics of a vortex loop. The latter\nshould be taken from the appropriate stochastic theory of chaotic vortex\nfilaments, which is unknown at present. Another way is to use numerical\nor/and experimental data. The latter gave rise to the Gaussian model of\nVT.5 In that theory the statistics of a vortex filament is supposed to be a\nGaussian. That supposition is quite natural if one realizes that a real vortex\nloop is formed as a result of numerous reconnections. Therefore the remote\nvortex line elements are weakly coupled. The only correlation between them\nappears due to propagating Kelvin waves. Then a step-by-step traversal\nalong a line is a nearly Markovian process. Correspondingly, statistics of\nsuch filaments should be Gaussian with a sharply decreasing correlation\nfunction N (\u03be1 \u2212 \u03be2 ) = hs\u2032 (\u03be1 )s\u2032 (\u03be2 )i between two remote tangent vectors.\nFor Gaussian statistics the probability for the line to have some particular configuration {s(\u03be)} is expressed by the path integral containing the ex-\n\n\fEnergy Spectrum of the Velocity Field\n\nponent of the bilinear combination of functions s(\u03be). In practice, to calculate\nvarious averages it is convenient to work with the characteristic (generating)\nfunctional (CF), which is defined as a following average:\ndef\n\nW ({P(\u03be)}) =\n\n*\n\n\uf8eb\n\nexp \uf8edi\n\nZL\n0\n\n\uf8f6+\n\nP(\u03be)s\u2032 (\u03be) d \u03be \uf8f8\n\n.\n\n(2)\n\nSince the probability functional is a Gaussian one, calculation of the CF\ncan be readily made by the full square procedure to give the result (here we\nconsider only the isotropic case)\n\uf8eb\n\nW ({P(\u03be)}) = exp \uf8ed\u2212\n\nZL ZL\n0 0\n\n\uf8f6\n\nd\u03be \u2032 d\u03be \u2032\u2032 P(\u03be \u2032 )N (\u03be \u2032 \u2212 \u03be \u2032\u2032 )P(\u03be \u2032\u2032 )\uf8f8 .\n\n(3)\n\nFrom the definition (2) of the CF it follows that the function N (\u03be \u2032 \u2212 \u03be \u2032\u2032 )\ncoincides with the correlation function hs\u2032\u03b1 (\u03be1 )s\u2032\u03b1 (\u03bej )i between tangent vectors. Combining (1) and (2) one concludes that the spectral density E(k) is\nexpressed via CF as follows (see5 for details):\n\n2\n\nE(k) = 2\u03c0\u03c1s \u03ba\n\nZL ZL\n0 0\n\nd\u03be1 d\u03be2\n\n\u03b42 W\ni\u03b4P\u03b1 (\u03be1 ) i\u03b4P\u03b1 (\u03be2 )\n\n. (4)\nPi (\u03bei ) = k\u03b8(\u03be\u2212\u03be1 )\u03b8(\u03be2 \u2212\u03be)\n\nHere \u03b8(\u03be) is a unit-step function. We will use relation (4) to calculate the\nspectral density of energy for various N (\u03be \u2032 \u2212 \u03be \u2032\u2032 ).\nBefore doing this let us discuss some fractal properties of vortex loops.\nLet us calculate the quantity D 2 = h(s\u03b1 (\u03bej ) \u2212 s\u03b1 (0))2 i, which is an averaged\nsquared distance between initial (arbitrary) point of the curve s(0) and the\npoints s(\u03bej ). Note that we deal with the real distance in three dimensional\nspace (not along the curve!), therefore this consideration concerns the real\nsize of the vortex loop embedded in 3D space. Using (3), the quantity\nh(s\u03b1 (\u03bej ) \u2212 s\u03b1 (0))2 i can be evaluated from relations:\nD2 =\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u03beJ\n\nZ\n\n\u03bej\n0\n\nd\u03be1 d\u03be2 hs\u2032\u03b1 (\u03be1 )s\u2032\u03b1 (\u03be2 )i =\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u03bej\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u03bej\n\nd\u03be1 d\u03be2 N (\u03be1 \u2212 \u03be2 ). (5)\n\nLet us assume that N (\u03be1 \u2212 \u03be2 ) is a power-law function N (\u03be1 \u2212 \u03be2 ) =\nN \u2217 (\u03be1 \u2212 \u03be2 )\u03bb . Here N is some constant with the proper dimension. Then\nthe integral in the rhs of (5) is evaluated as \u221d \u03bej\u03bb+2 . That implies that the\nlength L of the curve increases with its 3D size D as L \u221d D 2/(\u03bb+2) . The\nlatter implies that the average loop is a fractal object having the Hausdorf\n\n\fSergey K. Nemirovskii, M. Tsubota, and T. Araki\n\ndimension (HD) HD = 2/(\u03bb + 2). For the example of a pure random walk\nchain with the \"effective step\" l0 , the function N (\u03be1 \u2212 \u03be2 ) = l0 \u03b4(\u03be1 \u2212 \u03be2 ), and\nthe quantity \u03bb are equal (formally) to \u22121, HD = 2, and the length grows as\nL \u221d D 2 . For a set of smooth lines \u03bb = 0, and HD = 1. Vortex loops in the\nsuperfluid turbulent HeII are also described by Gaussian statistics. However\nthe function N (\u03be \u2032 \u2212 \u03be \u2032\u2032 ) is not a power-law function (see5 ). The small parts\nof the filament behave as a smooth line whose (3D) lengths are exactly equal\nto distance \u03be \u2032 \u2212 \u03be \u2032\u2032 along the curve. At the larger distance the filament has\na random walk structure with an \"effective step\" equal to the mean radius\nof curvature R. A good approximation for the quantity N (\u03be \u2032 \u2212 \u03be \u2032\u2032 ) could be\na function of type 1/(1 + (\u2206\u03be/R)2 ).\n3. ENERGY SPECTRUM OF THE VELOCITY FIELD\nLet us calculate first the energy spectrum for the vortex filaments, whose\nstatistics are Gaussian, with the CF (3) and the function N (\u03be \u2032 \u2212 \u03be \u2032\u2032 ), which\nis a pure power-law function N (\u03be \u2032 \u2212 \u03be \u2032\u2032 ) = N \u2217 \u2206\u03be \u03bb . Substituting this into\n(4) one obtains an extremely cumbersome relation which in general should\nbe evaluated numerically. However, since we intend to establish the connection between the fractal properties of the vortex filament and the power-law\nspectra of 3D velocity field, it is possible to obtain some analytical results\nby focusing on counting powers. By use of the substitution z 2 = k2 L\u2206\u03be \u03bb+2\nrelation (4) reduces to an expression having the following structure.\n\u03bb+2\n2\n\nE(k) = L\n\nkL\nZ\n0\n\n(\n\nAk\n\n2\n\n\u0012 \u0013 4+4\u03bb\n\nz\nk\n\n\u03bb+2\n\n+B\n\nz\nk\n\n\u0012 \u0013\n\n2\u03bb\n\u03bb+2\n\n)\n\nexp(\u2212z 2 )z \u03bb+2 k \u03bb+2 dz\n\u2212\u03bb\n\n\u22122\n\n(6)\n\nHere A and B are some numerical factors, of order of unity, appearing from\ncalculating of integrals and E(k) is reduced by factor 1/2\u03c0\u03c1s \u03ba2 . It is seen\nthat there are two different regions of the wave vector k, namely, large and\nsmall with respect to 1/L(\u03bb+2)/2 , which is nothing but the inverse 3D size\nof the loop. In the region k \u226a 1/L(\u03bb+2)/2 , the exponent is approximately\nunity, the term with B disappears due to the closeness of the line, and simple counting of powers shows that E(k) \u221d k2 . That distribution of the\nenergy (valid far from the loop) describes an equipartition law and implies\nthat dE/d3 k is constant. In the opposite case of large k we can take the\nupper limit of the integral to be equal to infinity, after that integral is evaluated as a combination of gamma functions (of constant arguments) multiplied by k\u2212(2+2\u03bb)/(\u03bb+2) . That implies that the spectral density of energy\nE(k) \u221d k\u22122+HD . That result was obtained earlier from very qualitative\nconsiderations and is discussed in the book by Frisch.1\n\n\fEnergy Spectrum of the Velocity Field\n\nFig. 1. (a) Energy spectra of a pure fractal line and (b), realistic vortex\nloop in superfluid turbulent HeII (see text).\nIn parallel to a 'counting of powers' we performed a numerical calculation of the spectra with the help of Mathematica 3.0. In Fig.1a we depict (in\nlogarithmic scale) three curves corresponding to the spectral density E(k)\nfor a pure fractal vortex filament of the length L = 100 (all units are arbitrary). The upper curve (see the region of small k) corresponds to the case\n\u03bb = 0, i.e. to smooth lines. It can be seen how dependence E(k) \u221d k2 is\nchanged to a dependence E(k) \u221d k\u22121 in the region of k \u223c 100\u22121 . That is\na general result, since HD = 1 and the 3D size of the curve is of order of\n100. The next (middle) curve corresponds to the case \u03bb = \u22124/5, i.e. to the\nso called self-avoid line. It is seen again that a k2 -dependence is changed\nto a dependence E(k) \u221d k\u22121/3 in the region of k \u223c 100\u22123/5 . Taking into\naccount that HD = 2/(\u03bb + 2) = 5/3, this behavior agrees with the general\nresult. The lower curve corresponds to the pure random walk chain with\nN (\u03be1 \u2212 \u03be2 ) = l0 \u03b4(\u03be1 \u2212 \u03be2 ). Formally \u03bb = \u22121, and HD = 2. Therefore the\nk2 -dependance is changed to k-independent spectral density E(k) \u221d k0 in\nthe region of k \u223c 100\u22121/2 , as it should be.\nLet us now consider a VT in HeII. As has been discussed earlier, the\nVT in HeII is a semi-fractal object, behaving as a smooth line for small\nseparation \u2206\u03be \u226a R, and having a random walk structure for large \u2206\u03be with\nHD = 2 and with the effective step equal to R. Therefore the speculations\nbased on \"counting of powers\" are not applicable directly. However one can\nassert that \u221a\nthe equipartition distribution of energy E(k) \u221d k2 in the region\nof k << 1/ LR should take place for a vortex loop in turbulent HeII. The\nregion of large wave numbers is divided with some additional value k \u223c 1/R.\nOne can suppose that at that point behavior of the spectrum changes, acquiring the properties of pure fractal with the corresponding HD in the\naccording regions. Namely, E(k) should\u221ascale as k0 in region 1/R << k,\nand be approximately k-independent 1/ LR << k << 1/R (provided the\nlatter is broad enough). Numerical calculations confirm this conjecture. In\nFig. 1b there is depicted (in logarithmic scale) the curves corresponding to\n\n\fSergey K. Nemirovskii, M. Tsubota, and T. Araki\n\nthe spectral density E(k) for a vortex loop of length L = 100 with R = 0.01\nand R = 1. It is clearly seen that the upper\ncurve (R = 0.01 ) has three\n\u221a\nregions with bends at the points kl = 1/ LR = 1, and kr = 1/R = 100. In\nthree different parts we have E(k) \u221d k2 , E(k) \u221d k0 and E(k) \u221d k\u22121 , correspondingly. That is in excellent agreement with qualitative considerations.\nWhen the\n\u221a mean radius of curvature is equal R = 10, the correspondent\nkl = 1/ LR \u2248 0.03, and kr = 1/R = 0.1. This behavior agrees with recent\nnumerical simulations7 and our own.\n4. Conclusion\nUsing the Gaussian approach for the chaotic vortex filament we calculate the energy spectrum E(k) of the 3D random velocity field, induced by\nthat VT. If the VT is assumed to be a purely fractal object, the E(k) is a\npower-law function E(k) \u221d k\u22122+HD . The spectrum of a more realistic VT\nalso agrees with that formula, if one thinks of VT as a semi-fractal object\nwith a varying (depending on scale) HD. Let us note that the HD of a simple\nnoncorrelated vortex loops satisfies the condition 1 < HD < 3. That implies that Gaussian lines cannot create 3D flow, which has the Kolmogorov\nspectrum E(k) \u221d k\u22125/3 . That implies that vortex loops should be strongly\ncorrelated (which, in turn, implies that the local approximation used in numerical calculations is invalid). Another variant is that the vortex filaments\nprobably play no special role in turbulent flow.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe work was partly funded by Russian Foundation for Basic Research,\nGrant N 99-02-16942\nREFERENCES\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n\nU.
