By collecting the information from 24 previously published lists and catalogs, we produce a comprehensive catalog (Master Catalog) of 1442 Galactic HII regions. For each object, we quote the original fluxes and\ndiameters as well as the available information on radio line velocities, line widths and line temperatures and\nthe errors on these quantitities. References to the original works are also reported. By exploiting all these data\nwe produce a Synthetic Catalog of fluxes and diameters (with corresponding errors) at 2.7 GHz. This choice\nis motivated by the extensive, although not complete, information available at this frequency, widely spread\namong many different catalogs, and by its relevance for both detailed studies on Galactic HII regions and the\nextrapolation up to millimetric wavelengths. The catalog can be used for detailed studies of Galactic HII regions\nand, by extrapolation, for investigations of HII regions up to millimetric wavelengths. In particular, we discuss\nthe study of the effects of microwave emission from HII regions on the new generation of Cosmic Microwave\nBackground (CMB) experiments. We present simulations of the detection of HII regions in the Planck high\nresolution CMB survey, and briefly analize some of the typical applications of our catalog to the evaluation of\nCMB anisotropy experiments such as calibration, beam reconstruction and straylight effects.

HII Regions \u2013 Catalogs \u2013 cosmic microwave background\n\n1. Introduction\nHII regions are very important radio sources within our\nGalaxy. They not only provide information about the early\nstages of stellar formation but represent also a unique\ntool to investigate the Galactic spiral structure. Moreover,\ntheir radio emission, not attenuated by dust extinction, is\npowerful enough to enable us to probe distant parts of\nthe Galactic plane. Despite their astrophysical relevance,\nthere is no currently available comprehensive catalog of\nthese objects. A few optical catalogs (Sharpless 1959;\nMars\u00e1lkov\u00e1 1974; Fich & Blitz 1982) do exist but they\nare severely limited by the dust obscuration effects menSend offprint requests to: R. Paladini, paladini@sissa.it\n\ntioned above. At radio wavelengths, the most comprehensive catalog of diffuse brightness nebulae is the COBE-HII\nCatalog at 2.7 GHz (Witebsky 1978a, 1978b). It includes\n909 objects and has provided a reliable tool for estimating the contribution of HII regions to Galactic free-free\nin the analysis of the COBE data. More recently, a list of\n760 objects with angular diameter less than 10\u2032 has been\ncompiled by Kuchar & Clark 1997 from the Green Bank\n(Condon et al. 1989) and Parkes-MIT-NRAO (Condon et\nal. 1993; Tasker et al. 1994) radio surveys at 4.85 GHz.\nThese catalogs can now be combined and updated with\nother recently published data. A strong motivation supporting this work is its relevance to cosmic microwave\nbackground (CMB) studies. Since the successful results of\n\n\f2\n\nR. Paladini et al.: A catalog of Galactic HII regions\n\nthe COBE satellite (Smoot et al. 1992), increasing efforts\nhave been devoted to investigating the cosmological information contained in the CMB anisotropies. Recent balloon experiments such as BOOMERANG (de Bernardis\net al. 2000) and MAXIMA-1 (Hanany et al. 2000) as well\nas ground interferometer experiments as DASI (Leitch et\nal. 2002), CBI (Mason et al. 2001) and VSA (Scott et al.\n2002) have achieved remarkable results but, at the same\ntime, have shown the necessity to improve our knowledge\nof all the relevant astrophysical foregrounds which may\naffect the recovery of the CMB angular power spectrum\nand, ultimately, of the cosmological parameters. In particular, the free-free emission is the least known among\nthe Galactic foregrounds. However, much of the free-free\nemission at low Galactic latitudes is produced by individual bright HII regions. Because of their strong emission,\nthey may represent a potential source of contamination\nfor the new generation of nearly full-sky coverage CMB\nanisotropy space missions at high sensitivity and resolution. These sources are also good candidates for receiver\nand antenna pattern calibration.\nBy collecting the information from 24 previously published\nlists and catalogs, we present in this paper a comprehensive catalog (Master Catalog) of 1442 Galactic HII regions.\nFor each object, we quote the original fluxes and diameters\nas well as the available information on radio recombination line velocities, line widths and line temperatures and\nthe errors on all these quantitities.\nBy exploiting these data we produce a Synthetic Catalog\nof fluxes and diameters (with corresponding errors) at\n2.7 GHz, motivated by the extensive although not complete information available at this frequency, widely\nspread among the different catalogs, and by its relevance\nfor both detailed studies on Galactic HII regions and the\nextrapolation up to millimetric wavelengths. We discuss\nalso some possible applications of this Synthetic Catalog\nto CMB studies. The paper is organized as follows. Sect. 2\npresents the stages of the Master Catalog compilation\n(e.g., the selection criteria for the reference papers and\nthe removal of non-thermal sources) and briefly summarizes the content of the final compilation, while an accurate and full description of the catalog content is given\nin Appendix I. Sect. 3 describes the production of the\nSynthetic Catalog at 2.7 GHz. Sect. 4 concerns the completeness and flux limit of the catalog and the spatial distribution of the listed sources. Perspectives of possible\napplications of this Synthetic Catalog to CMB studies are\npresented in Sect. 5. Finally, we draw our main conclusions\nin Sect. 6.\n\n2. The Master Catalog compilation\nIn this section we discuss the data processing which was\napplied to convert the information from the various reference catalogs into a uniform format for easy intercomparison in a Master Catalog.\n\n2.1. Selection of the original catalogs\nThe Master Catalog was compiled from the 24 radio catalogs shown in Table 1. We follow the classification of\nHII regions by Lockman et al. 1996 and only include\ncatalogs of diffuse and compact HII regions. Surveys of\nultra-compact (UCHII) and extremely extended objects\n(EHE) will be considered in a forthcoming extension of\nthe present list: they are bright in the infrared (UCHII)\nand in the optical (EHE) but relatively weak at radio frequencies.\nThe reason for following this route is driven by the\ngeneral goals of the work. Planned and on-going CMB\nexperiments typically have angular resolutions ranging\nfrom a few arcmin up to tens of arcmin in order to\nexploit the wealth of cosmological information encoded\nin the CMB anisotropies. Therefore, diffuse and compact\nHII regions \u2013 with a typical angular extension of a few\narcmin \u2013 are the most important to be taken into account\nif we want to investigate the free-free emission as a\ncontaminant of the CMB.\nWe have therefore considered single-dish mediumresolution observations, typically with beamwidths of\na few arcmin, rather than interferometer or synthesis\ntelescope surveys (Becker et al. 1994; Taylor et al. 1996)\nwhich usually achieve a resolution of a few arcsec. Also,\nsingle-dish low-resolution observations (Westerhout 1958;\nWilson & Bolton 1960), whose typical angular resolution\nis \u223c 1\u25e6 , have not been included in the sample of selected\nreferences in order to avoid problems arising from doublecounting of the sources. Likewise we have not considered\nsurveys simply oriented to the study of the morphology\nand spectral behaviour of the diffuse Galactic radiation\nat centimetric wavelengths (Reich et al. 1984; Reich et al.\n1990; F\u00fcrst et al. 1990a; F\u00fcrst et al 1990b; Duncan et al.\n1995).\n\n2.2. Identification and removal of SNRs\nThe selected catalogs may contain in principle also some\nGalactic sources, different from HII regions, that we\nneed to exclude from our Master Catalog compilation.\nTherefore, supernova remnants (SNRs) of each selected\ncatalog have been identified by comparing the coordinates\nof the catalog sources with those of the catalog of Galactic\nsupernova remnants by Green 2000. The identification has\nbeen performed taking into account the average position\nuncertainty of the selected catalogs of HII regions and of\nthe Green Catalog (both \u223c 1\u2032 ).\n\n2.3. Quoted flux densities and angular diameters\nWe provide the flux densities integrated over each source,\nS, and the source angular diameter, \u0398HII . In a few references (Wink et al. 1982 at 86 GHz; Wink et al. 1983) the\nflux density is given only as a peak value. We correct this\nto a true value by assuming that the source has a Gaussian\n\n\fR.

The Master Catalog\nAll sources observed at least by one of the surveys of\nTable 1 and recognized as Galactic HII regions were\nincluded in the Master Catalog. 1442 sources are listed.\nAll relevant information from each of the reference\ncatalogs is retained. Data for individual HII regions are\navailable from the references at 8 frequencies (1.4, 2.7,\n3.9, 4.8, 5., 14.7, 15 and 86 GHz).

Apart from sub-catalog 1, each sub-catalog\nhas 37 columns. The columns are in order of increasing\nfrequency of observation; at each frequency the columns\nare in alphabetical order of the references in Table 1. We\nnote that for sub-catalog 6-11 (the radio recombination\nline data) the observations may refer to frequencies other\nthan those in the main continuum catalog (in this case,\nthe line frequency is reported).\nAppendix I gives a detailed description of the content of\neach sub-catalog.\n\n3. The Synthetic Catalog at 2.7 GHz\nThe final task in bringing together the wide-spread radio data on HII regions is to construct a readily accessible catalog summarizing the basic information on each of\nthe 1442 sources covered in the comprehensive data base\nof the Master Catalog. This Synthetic Catalog gives the\nbest available data on flux density, angular diameter and,\nwhere available, the line velocity.\n2.7 GHz was chosen as the base frequency for the Synthetic\nCatalog; it lies in the middle of the frequency range of\nthose catalogs containing most of the data, namely 1.4,\n2.7 and 5 GHz. Since there is not complete source coverage at any one frequency, we derive the flux density at 2.7\nGHz from the observed frequencies for all the sources. We\nnow describe how best-estimate values of the flux density,\ndiameter and velocity with corresponding error estimates\nare derived from the Master Catalog.\n\n3.1. Flux density estimates at 2.7 GHz\nWe estimate the flux density at 2.7 GHz in four different\nways:\n1. we use the flux density measures at 2.7 GHz when these\nare available;\n2. if there are no flux density measures at 2.7 GHz and\nthere are available measures at only one other frequency, we extrapolate these values to 2.7 GHz with\nthe theoretical spectral index \u03b1 = \u22120.1 (S \u221d \u03bd \u03b1 )\nwhich is typical of thermal bremsstrahlung emission\nin a thin plasma;\n3. if there are flux density measures only at frequencies\n\u2265 14.7 GHz, we first select the lowest among the given\nfrequencies \u2013 averaging over 14.7 and 15 GHz when\nboth are available \u2013 and then extrapolate to 2.7 GHz\nwith \u03b1 = \u22120.1;\n\n4. if there are only flux density measures at frequencies other than 2.7 GHz and at least one measure at\n\u03bd \u2264 5 GHz, we follow these lines: we exclude the values at 3.9, 14.7, 15 and 86 GHz, we take the weighted\naverage between 4.8 and 5 GHz if both measures are\navailable, we interpolate the remaining values to 2.7\nGHz (or extrapolate with \u03b1 = \u22120.1 if only one frequency measure is left).\nWe consider the data at 3.9, 14.7, 15 and 86 GHz less reliable for the following reasons: the 3.9 GHz measure may be\nsignificantly affected by the ellipticity of the antenna pattern; at 14.7 and 15 GHz the observing resolution is much\nhigher than the typical reference catalogs resolution; at 86\nGHz, in addition to the higher resolution, dust emission\nmay contribute largely to the observed flux. Moreover, we\nprefer to interpolate between 1.4 and 5 GHz rather than\nextrapolate to 2.7 GHz directly from only one of these\ntwo frequencies because we have no information on the\nfrequency location of the free-free knee.\nIn cases when multiple observations are available at the\nsame frequency, a weighted mean flux density is computed,\nusing the errors discussed below.\nFor the majority of the sources in the reference catalogs,\nflux density errors are quoted and these are used in deriving the flux density and its error in the Synthetic Catalog.\nIn the catalogs where no errors are given, an estimate of\nthe error is made by comparing the flux S\u2217 from a catalog\nwithout errors with the flux S from a catalog (or some\ncatalogs) giving errors. In particular, we compute the relative (%) dispersion, \u03c3 = 100(S\u2217 \u2212 S)/S, and try to fit\nthe resulting distribution in the S \u2212 \u03c3 plane with a constant, \u03c3 = a , a linear, \u03c3 = a + bS\u2217 , and a quadratic,\n\u03c3 = a + bS\u2217 + cS\u22172 , dependence of \u03c3 on S\u2217 . In these equations the fluxes are in Jy. Before fitting the \u03c3(S\u2217 ) distribution, we remove the relatively small number of points\nwith a dispersion \u2243 130%. Although we have considered\nalso fits with a constant, linear, and quadratic dependence\nof log\u03c3 on logS\u2217 , we prefer to use the distributions recovered from the fit carried out with linear variables, since\nthey give, as expected, typical values of \u03c3(S\u2217 ) larger than\nthose obtained in the case of logarithmic variables and so\ngiving more conservative error estimates. Fig. 1 shows the\nresults of the procedure we have described.\nAn example of the estimates of errors is given by the early\nParkes 2.7 GHz catalogs. We compare the list of Parkes\nsources to the reference catalogs at the same frequency \u2013\n2.7 GHz \u2013 (namely, Altenhoff et al. 1970, F\u00fcrst et al. 1987,\nReich et al. 1986, Wendker 1970), in order to retrieve the\nsubset of Parkes sources whose flux has been quoted with\nan estimated error. In particular, the comparison retrieves\n105 sources in common with the Altenhoff et al. 1970 catalog. The scatter \u03c3 in the flux density differences, quite\nwell fitted by the law \u03c3 \u2243 33.5 \u2212 0.1 \u00d7 S, is comparable to\nthe errors of 10\u201330 % of the Altenhoff et al. catalog alone.\nSimilar comparisons have been carried out for the Mezger\n& Henderson 1967 data and for Wink et al. 1983 data.\nHowever, as for the Mezger & Henderson data, the com-\n\n\fR. Paladini et al.: A catalog of Galactic HII regions\n\n5\n\nFig. 1. Results of the flux error estimate for: earlier Parkes survey at 2.7 GHz (top left); Mezger & Henderson 1967\n(top right); Wink et al. 1983 (bottom center). Plotted points in each panel correspond to the \u03c3(S\u2217 ) distribution (where\n\u03c3 is defined as 100(S\u2217 \u2212 S)/S). Overlaid \u2013 solid line \u2013 is the best fit function. See Sect. 3.1 for more details on the\nquantities.\n\nparison with other single catalogs does not provide a significant statistical subset of sources. Therefore, we estimate\nthe error by considering simultaneously the sources from\nthe Mezger & Henderson catalog and from all the other\ncatalogs at 5 GHz (which leads to consider altogether 38\ncommon sources). For the Wink et al. 1983 catalog, we derive an error estimate from the comparison with the Wink\net al. 1982 catalog for which we have 21 common sources.\nAfter having estimated the errors on the flux density measures for all catalogs, we compute the errors on the flux\ndensities of the Synthetic Catalog at 2.7 GHz. When an extrapolation with a spectral index \u03b1 = \u22120.1 from a measure\nat a single frequency different from 2.7 GHz is applied, we\nuse the standard error propagation rules. No error on \u03b1 is\nincluded in the error propagation, for simplicity.\nTable 3 summarizes the errors quoted in the original catalogs and those estimated in this work.\n\n3.2. Angular diameter\nWe discuss here the assignment of an angular diameter\nwith its associated error for every source in the Synthetic\nCatalog. The published diameter data are not as compre-\n\nhensive as the flux density data described in Sect. 3.1;\nnevertheless we will assign a value of the diameter and\nan error for each source. For 42 % of the sources (derived\nfrom the Parkes catalogs and those of Mezger & Henderson\n1967, Wendker 1970, Wink et al. 1982, Wink et al. 1983,\nBerlin et al. 1985) there are no listed diameter errors. For\n14 % of the sources no diameter is given; for these we\nderive an indicative diameter.\nWe assign a diameter for sources in the Synthetic Catalog\nas follows:\n\n1. when 2.7 GHz diameters are given, we use these values\n(possibly their weighted average);\n2. if there is at least one diameter measure at 5 GHz\nor at 4.8 GHz, we neglect possible measurements at\nother frequencies and use this value or, alternatively,\nthe weighted average of the diameter measures at 4.8\nand 5 GHz when available, using the errors discussed\nbelow;\n3. if diameter data are given only at frequencies other\nthan \u223c 4.8\u22125 GHz, we use the weighted average of the\navailable frequencies, after previous exclusion of the\n\n\f6\n\nR. Paladini et al.: A catalog of Galactic HII regions\n\nmeasures at \u03bd \u223c 14.7 GHz, using the errors discussed\nbelow;\n4. if no diameter data is given at frequencies lower than\n\u223c 14.7 GHz, we use the available measure at 14.7 GHz\nor at 15 GHz or, alternatively, their weighted average\nwhen both values are provided using the errors discussed below (we remember that no diameter data are\navailable at 86 GHz).\nValues at 14.7 and 15 GHz are preferably excluded because of the much higher resolution at these frequencies\nthan the typical reference catalog resolution. In each case,\nwhen multiple observations are available at the same frequency, a weighted mean is computed, using the errors\ndiscussed below.\nFinally, we consider the assignment of a diameter to the\n14 % of HII regions in the Synthetic Catalog which have\nno quoted diameter in the reference catalogs. It is possible to derive a first-order indicative diameter by noting\nthat the flux density and the diameter of HII regions are\nweakly correlated, as shown in Fig 2 which includes all the\nsources at 2.7 GHz with measured diameters. The best fit\nto the data gives as indicative diameter \u03b8 = 2.25\u00d7S with a\ntypical error of a factor of 2\u20133. Each source with an indicative diameter is annotated in the Synthetic Catalog; such\ndiameter data clearly should not be used in astrophysical\nanalyses of the catalog.\n\nsources in common is retrieved, we prefer to consider in the\ncomparison surveys at the same frequency and with similar angular resolution. Therefore, let \u0398\u2217 (\u0398) be the source\ndiameter measure in the catalog without quoted errors\n(with quoted errors). We compute the relative (%) dispersion \u03c3 of the diameter measures, \u03c3 = 100(\u0398\u2217 \u2212 \u0398)/\u0398, and\ntry to fit the resulting distribution in the \u0398\u2217 \u2212 \u03c3 plane\nagain with a constant, linear, and quadratic, dependence\nof \u03c3 on \u0398\u2217 (or of log\u03c3 on log\u0398\u2217 ; in this case the fit error\nestimates are again less conservative) and after removing\nthe points with a dispersion \u2243 130%. In these equations\nthe angular diameters are in arcmin.\n\nFig. 3. Diameter measures at 2.7 GHz (y-axis) versus diameter measures and at 5 GHz (x-axis). It is evident the\ngood agreement between the two datasets. The best fit\nfunction is: \u03982.7GHz = 1.17 + 1.17 \u00d7 \u03985GHz . Data are\nfrom: earlier Parkes survey (2.7 GHz data); Altenhoff et\nal. 1970a , Mezger & Henderson 1967; Reifenstein et al.\n1970 (5 GHz data).\n\nFig. 2. Correlation between flux densities at 2.7 GHz and\nangular diameters observed at the same frequency. The\nsolid line represents the best-fit for the plotted distribution.\nFollowing the same strategy as in Sect. 3.1, where a catalog\nhas no quoted diameter errors we estimate an overall error for that catalog by comparing the observed diameters\nof that catalog with another catalog having an adequate\nnumber of sources in common. However, with respect to\nthe flux density case, we can now relax the strict requirement of comparing only different datasets at the same\nfrequency. As shown in Fig. 3, there is no significant frequency dependence in the measured diameters at 2.7 GHz\n(the Parkes survey) and at 5 GHz (Altenhoff et al. 1970,\nMezger & Henderson 1967 and Reifenstein et al. 1970).\nOn the other hand, provided that an adequate number of\n\nFig 4 shows the results of the error estimates. In particular, we consider the comparison between the following\ndatasets (the first one is that for which we are estimating the errors): Altenhoff et al. 1970a vs. Reifenstein et\nal. 1970 (48 common sources); Altenhoff et al. 1970b vs.\nKuchar & Clark 1997 (63 common sources); Caswell &\nHaynes 1987 vs. Wilson et al. 1970 (79 common sources);\nearly Parkes 2.7 GHz Survey vs. Reifenstein et al. 1970\n(31 common sources); Felli & Churchwell 1972 vs. Kuchar\n& Clark 1997 (21 common sources); Wendker 1970 vs.\nReifenstein et al. 1970 (8 common sources); Wink et al.\n1983 vs. Downes 1980 (59 common sources); Wink et al.\n1982 vs. Altenhoff et al. 1979 (53 common sources).\nAs for the Altenhoff et al. 1970 catalog, the data have\nbeen split because the diameters have been measured in\ntwo different ways: either they were taken from a survey\nof Galactic sources made at 5 GHz with the 140-ft antenna - beamwidth 6\u2032 (W.J. Altenhoff, P.G. Mezger and\nJ. Schraml, private communication) - or they were measured directly from contour maps. We will annotate the set\nof sources for which the size was measured in the 5 GHz\nsurvey Altenhoff et al. 1970a and the remaining sources\n\n\fR. Paladini et al.: A catalog of Galactic HII regions\n\nAltenhoff et al. 1970b. For the Berlin et al. 1985 catalog,\nsince none of the comparisons with other catalogs retrieves\na significant number of common sources, we derive the error from the mean of the dispersions \u03c3 given by each comparison. Table 3 summarizes the estimated and quoted\nerrors used in calculating the diameters in the Synthetic\nCatalog.\n\n3.3. Content of the Synthetic Catalog\nThe Synthetic Catalog summarizes the known radio frequency information on 1442 Galactic HII regions. It contains the position, flux density, diameter data for each HII\nregion, supplemented by velocity data where available. To\nthose HII region with no published diameter data, an indicative diameter is given (marked by \u2217\u2217) on the basis\nof the flux-size correlation in Fig 2. For sake of clarity,\nthe first ten lines of the Synthetic Catalog are reported in\nTable 2. The line velocity value that we quote in Col. 9 is\nthe weighted average of the available data (see Sect. 2.4\nfor details). Although the original measures can be, for\nthe same source, at different frequencies, the weighted average of these data is a meaningful quantity and provides\na useful first-sight kinematic indication. Since the line velocity is an effect of the Galactic rotation motion, it does\nnot strongly depend on the frequency of observation.\n\n7\n\nOther surveys (e.g. Altenhoff et al., 1970) are sensitive to\na wide range of angular scales but include only sources\nstronger than 1 Jy. We now consider the properties of the\nsources listed in the Synthetic Catalog in the light of these\nselection criteria.\n\n4.1. Completeness and flux density limit\nA useful way of investigating the completeness of a catalog is to plot the integral count N(> S) as a function of\nflux density S. Fig 5 shows the integral count for the 1442\nsources included in the Synthetic Catalog and for the five\ncontributing catalogs containing more than 200 HII regions. It is evident that the Synthetic Catalog is losing\nsources fainter than \u223c 1 Jy. The data in the Synthetic\nCatalog for S < 1 Jy are mainly contributed by the\nKuchar & Clark 1997 catalog. Some 50 % of the sources at\n1 Jy are contributed by this catalog, with a higher fraction\nat lower flux densities.\n\nFig. 6. Top panel: Galactic latitude distribution of the\nHII regions of the Synthetic catalog. The mean Galactic\nlatitude is is b=0.05\u25e6 . Bottom panel: Galactic longitude\ndistribution.\n\n4. Statistical properties of the Synthetic Catalog\nThe Synthetic Catalog combines the observational data\nfrom 24 catalogs with various flux density limits and different angular resolutions. The Kuchar & Clark 1997 catalog, for example, reaches to a sensitivity of 30 mJy but is\nnot sensitive to sources with diameters greater than \u223c10\u2032\ndue to its beamswitching strategy.\n\nFig. 5. Cumulative counts, N(> S), for the Synthetic\nCatalog (solid line) and 5 contributing catalogs: Kuchar &\nClark 1997 (dash-dot line), early Parkes 2.7 GHz catalogs\n(dashed line), Caswell & Haynes 1987 (long-dash line),\nAltenhoff et al. 1970 (dotted line), Altenhoff et al. 1979\n(three dots-dashes).\n\nThe absence of sources at lower flux densities is largely\nthe consequence of source confusion along the Galactic\nplane. For example, in the region | l | < 60\u25e6 there are\n1200 Synthetic Catalog sources within the Galactic plane\n(| b | < 2\u25e6 ); in a 10\u2032 beam (or a 10\u2032 diameter source) there\n\n\f8\n\nR.

Spatial distribution\nThe Galactic latitude and longitude distribution of the\nHII regions in the Synthetic Catalog are shown in Fig 6.\nA striking feature is the narrow distribution in Galactic\nlatitude where the full width at half power is 0.95\u25e6 when\naveraged over all longitudes; the mean Galactic latitude is\nb=0.05\u25e6. This narrow distribution will reflect the distribution of the O and B stars responsible for the ionization.\nThe main concentration in longitude is at | l | < 60\u25e6 where\nthe line of sight cuts the spiral arms internal to the local\narm in which the Sun lies. There are also discernable peaks\nat l \u223c \u00b1 80\u25e6 associated with the local arm; the peak at l\n\u223c 80\u25e6 is the Cygnus X region where Wendker 1970 identified 77 HII regions in his survey. There is a clear deficit\nof sources in the anticentre region of the Galaxy (l =90\u25e6 \u2013\n270\u25e6 ). Although there is a less complete coverage in this\nsector of the Galactic plane as indicated in Table 1, the\nlarge deficit of sources is real. The optical study of the\ndistribution of HII regions in the outer Galaxy by Fich &\nBlitz 1984 indicate that they are limited to R < 20 Kpc.\n\n5.

We consider some uses of\nthis catalog and the associated Master Catalog for studies\nof individual HII regions over a range of frequencies and\nfor CMB studies.\n\n5.1. Detectability of HII regions\nThe sensitivity of a particular instrument in Kelvin to\nan HII region of a given flux density expressed in Jansky\ndepends upon the observing frequency \u03bd, the beamwidth\n(FWHM), the sensitivity per second of integration and the\nobserving time t (the rms noise decreases with observing\n1\ntime t as t\u2212 2 ). The rms noise in Jansky per second of\nintegration, rms1s,f , is related to the rms antenna temperature in Kelvin per second of integration, rms1s,a , by:\n(rms1s,f /Jy) = 2.95 \u00d7 10\u22123 (FWHM/arcmin)2 *\n(\u03bd/GHz)2 (rms1s,a /K)\n\n(1)\n\nand the same relation holds between the source signal expressed in terms of flux density or of antenna temperature.\nHere the source is assumed to be point-like and observed\nat the centre of a Gaussian, symmetric beam. Eq. (1) can\nbe then used to determine the S/N for a point source of\na given flux density. In cases when a source with a diameter comparable or bigger than the FWHM of the observing beam is considered, a correcting factor to Eq. (1)\nis required to compute the S/N. In particular, the S/N is\n\u223c 40 to 90 % the value computed with Eq. (1) when a\nsource with a diameter \u223c 2 \u2212 3 times the beamwidth or\n\u223c 1/2 \u2212 1/3 the beamwidth, respectively, is considered.\nThe S/N represents an easy way to compare the signal\nproduced by Galactic HII regions with the sensitivity of a\ntypical CMB anisotropy experiment. Therefore, we apply\nthe above treatment to the high resolution satellite expe-\n\n\f10\n\nR. Paladini et al.: A catalog of Galactic HII regions\n\nriment Planck by ESA 1 , scheduled for launch in 2007.\nPlanck will observe the entire sky with a sensitivity at\nthe end of the mission of about 10 \u03bcK per resolution element. The beamwidths vary between \u223c 33.6\u2032 and 5\u2032 from\n30 to 857 GHz respectively. For numerical estimates, we\nconsider here the channels at 30 and 100 GHz which have\na nominal FWHM of \u223c 33.6' and 10'. For comparison, we\nmake the same calculation for COBE-DMR for which, at\n31.5 and 90 GHz the rms temperature was 150 and 100\n\u03bcK and the beamwidth was 7\u25e6 (Boggess et al. 1992).\nThe S/N for all the HII regions in the Synthetic Catalog\nhave been calculated as discussed above; the flux densities\nwere estimated at each frequency from 2.7 GHz values\nassuming a flux density proportional to \u03bd \u22120.1 . Fig. 7 shows\nthe number of sources per bin of S/N (the distribution\nfunction) and number of sources greater than a certain\nS/N (cumulative distribution function) for both Planck\nand COBE-DMR at \u223c 30 and \u223c 100 GHz.\nFrom Fig. 7 it is clear that the vast majority of sources in\nthe Synthetic Catalog produces a signal which highly exceeds the detection threshold of the instrument. Therefore,\nnot only all the Synthetic Catalog HII regions will be detected but also 80% of these sources will have a S/N > 100\n(while the weakest sources, with S \u223c 10 mJy, will be seen\nwith a S/N \u223c 3). As a consequence, Planck high sensitivity and high resolution should allow to significantly\nentend the existing HII regions data base. It is important\nto emphasize that none of the individual HII regions would\nhave been seen by COBE-DMR whose flux sensitivity according to Eq. (1) is 6 \u00d7 103 less than Planck at 30 GHz\nand 4 \u00d7 104 less at 100 GHz.\n\n5.2. Radio/millimeter studies of HII regions\nThe ionizing radiation from the central O/B stars produces the HII region which emits through the free-free\nmechanism from radio to submillimetric wavelenghts; the\nsurrounding dust is also heated by radiation originally derived from the central stars and as a consequence radiates\nat submillimeter and IR wavelenghts. The flux density of\nthe radiation from these two components was found to be\nequal in the wavelenght range 1-3 mm (100 to 300 GHz)\nby Kurtz et al. 1994 for a selection of compact HII regions. However, many interesting questions remain to be\nresolved in the physical relationship between the HII region and the radiation-heated dust cloud in which it is\nembedded. The Synthetic Catalog provides a rich source\nof HII regions for further study. Fig. 7 shows that many\nhundreds of HII regions will be detectable at high sensitivity and with adequate resolution over the frequency\nrange 30 to 857 GHz by Planck. Thus, this may represent a good chance for a comparative study of the far-IR\nand radio continuum morphology of Galactic HII regions.\nMoreover, source identification in IR experiments such as\nDENIS (Epchetein et al., 1994) and 2MASS (Kleinmann,\n1992) can benefit from the crosscheck with the Synthetic\n1\n\nhttp://planck.esa.nl\n\nCatalog. In fact, for these kind of experiments a major\nproblem is the association of an observed source with a\nbright IR Galactic object like an HII region or an ultracompact HII region rather than with an external Galaxy.\n\n5.3. Use of the Synthetic Catalog in CMB studies\nWe will consider in this subsection several applications of\nthe Synthetic Catalog in CMB studies. The first use we\ndiscuss is the production of maps of the integrated freefree emission as seen with the angular resolution of an\ninstrument such as Planck at each observing frequency.\nFree-free emission dominates the Galactic plane signal at\nleast over the range 30 to 100 GHz. Fig. 8 shows the\nGalactic plane emission resulting from HII regions as seen\nby Planck at 30 GHz where the beamwidth is 33.6'.\nTo make the map in Fig. 8, we have implemented a code\nwhich simulates the contribution of each source in the\nSynthetic Catalog at a given angular resolution by assuming a symmetric Gaussian profile for the source brightness distribution and numerically convolves, in real space,\nthe relevant part of the map \u2013 obtained after considering the contribution from all the sources in the catalog\n\u2013 with another symmetric Gaussian profile having the instrument FWHM. The final map is generated in HEALPix\n(Hierarchical Equal Area and IsoLatitude Pixelization of\nthe Sphere, by G\u00f2rski et al. 1998). Fig. 9 shows the strong\nGalactic centre and Cygnus X regions. Antenna temperature as high as \u223c 50 mK are seen.\nMoreover, HII regions, as delineated in Fig. 8, can in\nprinciple represent a significant contribution \u2013 comparable to that produced by synchrotron and dust emission \u2013\nto one of the most critical spurious effects in CMB surveys, the so-called straylight contamination through their\nintegrated signal in the sidelobes (Burigana et al. 2001)\nwhich needs to be properly evaluated. The optical design\nof Planck and similar mapping instruments must be optimized to minimize this effect. In any case, the residual\nstraylight should be taken into account in the data analysis.\nHII regions also have a part to play in CMB imaging\nexperiments as suitable calibrators and as probes of the\npointing and beamshape. HII regions are non-variable and\nhave quite a well-known spectrum which makes them valuable calibrators along with planets and the CMB dipole\n(Bersanelli et al. 1997). In addition, for space missions,\nthey provide auxiliary data for inflight beam reconstruction and pointing by complementing the information\nfrom planet transits (Burigana et al. 2002) and from the\ninterplay between amplitudes and phases of CMB signal\nwith the instrumental noise (Chiang et al. 2002). In particular, the Chiang et al. method, although not requiring\nthe use of bright sources, allows the reconstruction of the\nbeam ellipticity only in the beam central regions while the\nBurigana et al. technique allows the complete reconstruction of the beam shape down to a level of -25 dB but makes\nuse of non-variable, bright, compact sources.

Conclusions\nWe have collected radio data of Galactic HII regions from\n24 published works and built a self-consistent database of\n1442 sources. This work has resulted in the construction\nof what we have called Master Catalog which consists in\n11 different sub-catalogs storing the original information\nfrom the source references. In particular, the sub-catalogs\nlist flux densities and diameters as well as radio line velocities, line widths and line temperatures; errors are given\non these quantities.\n\nFrom this large data set observed at a range of frequencies\nand beamwidths, we have produced a readibily accessible\nSynthetic Catalog giving the flux density, diameter and velocity (where available) at 2.7 GHz, the frequency where\nmost data are given. Errors on these observed parameters\nare derived using the procedures discussed in Sect. 3.\nIt should be emphasized that the Catalog is a compilation\nof published radio data on HII regions; it is not a complete survey down to the faintest flux density level listed.\nWe argue in Sect. 4 that it is probably complete to a flux\n\n\fR.

Due to the extensive\namount of information, we have divided for convenience\nthe Master Catalog into 11 sub-catalogs. We give hereafter the description of the structure of each of these compilations while, for a general overview about the content\nof the sub-catalogs, we refer the reader to Sec. 2.5.\nAs mentioned in the main text (Sect. 2.5), each subcatalog (except for Sub-catalog 1) has 37 columns and\n1442 entries corresponding to the total number of sources.\nThe columns are in order of increasing frequency of observation and, at each frequency, the columns are in alphabetical order of the references in Table 1. In all subcatalogs, a null entry corresponds to no information available from the source reference.\nSub-catalog 1 lists only source coordinates, notes about\nthe environment and radio/optical couterparts. For its\ncontent specificy, it presents a peculiar structure with respect to the other sub-catalogs.
