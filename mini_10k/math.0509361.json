As an application, the Euler characteristic of these moduli is computed.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIt is a common theme in moduli theory to consider fixed point sets under torus\nactions, see for example [8, Section 3] in the context of moduli of vector bundles.\nAs a general principle, the torus fixed points in moduli spaces of objects like\nrepresentations, sheaves, etc., correspond to certain graded, or equivariant, such\nobjects.\nIn the ideal case of a smooth projective moduli space and a torus acting with\nfinitely many fixed points, one can apply the Bialynicki-Birula theorem [2] to\nconclude rationality, to construct cell decompositions and to compute the Betti\nnumbers.\nIn general, the moduli spaces in question are seldomly projective, and the only\nknown compactifications are usually highly singular. For example, this may be\nthe case when the moduli are constructed as Mumford quotients [11] of stable points; then a natural compactification is often provided by considering the\nquotient of semistable points. In this case, the localization to torus fixed points\ncan still provide cohomological information on the moduli space (although the\nmethod is not strong enough to provide cell decompositions). For example, for\nequivariantly formal (in the sense of [7]) moduli, the equivariant cohomology\ncan be computed.\nThe main theme of the present paper is to apply the localization principle to projectivizations of quiver moduli parametrizing simple representations of quivers,\nto be introduced and discussed in section 2 (unfortunately, there seems to be no\nstraightforward generalization to the more general quiver moduli parametrizing\n\n1\n\n\fstable representations). Based on an analysis of the fixed points in section 3, the\nfirst main result, Theorem 2.7, gives a description of a set of torus fixed points\nas a disjoint union of moduli spaces of the same type, that is, of projectived\nmoduli of simple representations for other quivers. In fact, the quivers appearing in this description are 'almost universal abelian coverings' of the original\nquiver. Therefore, in the course of the proof, some principles of covering theory\nof finite dimensional algebras have to be studied in the context of simple quiver\nrepresentations in section 4.\nIn [12], it is proven that the number of rational points of models of quiver moduli\nover finite fields behaves polynomially in the cardinality q of the field. Starting\nfrom computer experiments, a formula for the value of the first derivative of\nthese counting polynomials at q = 1 was conjectured. Using some arithmetic\ngeometry, this number can be reinterpreted as the Euler characteristic in cohomology with compact support of the projectivized quiver moduli.\nIn this form, the conjecture is proven in section 5. Namely, Theorem 2.6 identifies the Euler characteristic in question as the number of cyclic equivalence\nclasses of primitive cycles in the given quiver of a certain weight. In fact, the\nlocalization techniques of this paper were developed for the purpose of computing this number.\nThe description of the fixed point set provides an interesting interaction between\nalgebraic geometry and representation theory of quivers: the detection of torus\nfixed points naturally leads to the study of covering techniques for simple representations. After such methods are developed, they can be successfully applied\nto the geometry of quiver moduli. The description also motivates consideration of a very special class of combinatorially defined simple representations of\nquivers, called string representations (Definition 6.1), which are in some sense\n'responsible' for aspects of the global topology of the moduli.\nAcknowledgments: The author would like to thank M. Brion and W. Soergel for helpful remarks concerning the localization principle, and V. Ginzburg,\nS. Kumar, L. Le Bruyn and C. M. Ringel for interesting discussions.\n\n2\n\nProjectivized quiver moduli\n\nLet Q be a quiver with finite set of vertices Q0 and finite set of arrows Q1 , which\nwill be written as \u03b1 : i \u2192 j for i, j \u2208 Q0 . In the following, we will frequently\nconsider the abelian groups\nM\nM\nZQ0 =\nZi, ZQ1 =\nZ\u03b1,\ni\u2208Q0\n\n\u03b1\u2208Q1\n\nand the subsemigroups NQ0 (called the lattice of dimension vectors for Q),\nresp. NQ1 . On these groups, we have natural Z-gradings by setting the degree\nof the natural basis elements i (resp. \u03b1) to be 1. The degree of a homogeneous\n2\n\n\felement d in either of the two groups is denoted by |d|.\nA cycle \u03c9 = (\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1s ) at i \u2208 Q0 in Q is a (possibly empty) sequence of arrows\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b1\n\ni = i0 \u21921 i1 \u21922 . . . \u2192s is = i\nin Q. To \u03c9, we associate its weight |\u03c9| \u2208 NQ1 as follows: for each \u03b1 \u2208 Q1 ,\nthe component |\u03c9|\u03b1 equals the number of occurences of the arrow \u03b1 in the\nsequence of arrows \u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1s . We associate to the cycle \u03c9 its dimension vector\ndim \u03c9 \u2208 NQ0 as follows: for each i \u2208 Q0 , the component (dim \u03c9)i equals the\nnumber\nof indices l such that il = i. In other words, \u03c9 has dimension vector\nP\nd\ni\u2208Q0 i i if it passes through each vertex i precisely di -times.\nWe have the notion of cyclic equivalence of cycles, which is the equivalence\nrelation generated by\n(\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1s ) \u223c (\u03b12 , . . . , \u03b1s , \u03b11 ).\nWe denote by Cd (Q) the set of cyclic equivalence classes of cycles in Q of dimension vector d. The cycle \u03c9 is called primitive if it is not cyclically equivalent\nto a non-trivial power (that is, iterated concatenation) (\u03c9 \u2032 )n of another cycle\n\u03c9 \u2032 . The subset of Cd (Q) corresponding to classes of primitive cycles is denoted\nby Cdprim (Q).\nWe introduce a non-symmetric bilinear form, the Euler form, on ZQ0 by\nX\nX\nhd, ei :=\ndi ej .\ndi ei \u2212\n\u03b1:i\u2192j\n\ni\u2208Q0\n\nLet\nd=\n\nX\n\ndi i \u2208 NQ0\n\ni\u2208Q0\n\nbe a dimension vector, and fix complex vector spaces Vi of dimension di for all\ni \u2208 Q0 . The affine space\nM\nHom(Vi , Vj )\nRd (Q) :=\n\u03b1:i\u2192j\n\nparametrizes complex representations\nX = ((Vi )i\u2208Q0 , (X\u03b1 : Vi \u2192 Vj )(\u03b1:i\u2192j)\u2208Q1 )\nof Q of dimension vector d. The reductive linear algebraic group\nY\nGd :=\nGL(Vi )\ni\u2208Q0\n\nacts on Rd (Q) by base change\n(gi )i * (X\u03b1 )\u03b1 := (gj X\u03b1 gi\u22121 )\u03b1:i\u2192j\n3\n\n\fin such a way that the orbits Gd X correspond to the isomorphism classes [X] of\nrepresentations. The scalar matrices, embedded diagonally into Gd , act trivially\non Rd (Q). Therefore, the action of Gd factors through the quotient\nP Gd := Gd /C\u2217 .\nBy [1], an orbit Gd X is closed in Rd (Q) if and only X is a semisimple representation of Q. Each cycle \u03c9 = (\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1s ) in Q induces a function t\u03c9 on Rd (Q)\n(the trace along the oriented cycle \u03c9) by\nt\u03c9 : (X\u03b1 )\u03b1 7\u2192 tr(X\u03b1s . . . X\u03b11 ).\nFor each vertex i \u2208 Q0 , we have the simple representation Si of dimension vector\ni \u2208 NQ0 . The point 0 \u2208 Rd (Q) corresponds to the semisimple representation\nL\ndi\ni\u2208I Si .\nThe following properties of a representation X \u2208 Rd (Q) are equivalent (see [9]):\n1. the orbit closure Gd X contains the point 0 \u2208 Rd (Q),\n2. All functions t\u03c9 vanish at the point X,\n3. all Jordan-H\u00f6lder factors of X are isomorphic to some Si .\nDenote by Nd (Q) the closed subvariety of Rd (Q) of all points X satisfying one\nof the above three equivalent conditions, called the nullcone in Rd (Q).\nIn order to form the quotient of Rd (Q) by the action of Gd , we have to describe\nthe ring of Gd -invariant functions on Rd (Q). This is done by the following\ntheorem, due to L. Le Bruyn and C. Procesi:\nTheorem 2.1 [10] The invariant ring C[Rd (Q)]Gd is generated by the traces\nt\u03c9 along cycles \u03c9 in Q.\nTherefore, one can coordinatize the quotient\nMdssimp (Q) := Rd (Q)//Gd (Q)\nby coordinates t\u03c9 , where \u03c9 runs through representatives of the cyclic equivalence\nclasses of cycles. The quotient Mdssimp (Q) parametrizes the closed orbits of Gd in\nRd (Q), thus it parametrizes isomorphism classes of semisimple representations\nof Q of dimension vector d.\nFormation of the direct sum of representations induces direct sum maps\nM\nssimp\n: Mdssimp (Q) \u00d7 Messimp (Q) \u2192 Md+e\n(Q).\nd,e\n\nThe complement of the image of all non-trivial direct sum maps is an open\nsubset\nMdsimp (Q) \u2282 Mdssimp (Q),\n4\n\n\fwhich, by definition, parametrizes isomorphism classes of simple representations\nof Q of dimension vector d. If Mdsimp (Q) is non-empty, then, by the above, it is\na smooth irreducible variety of dimension\ndim Mdsimp (Q) = dim Rd (Q) \u2212 dim P Gd = 1 \u2212 hd, di.\nThe variety Mdsimp (Q) admits a model over Z, that is, there exists a scheme over\nZ such that the base extension to C is isomorphic to Mdsimp (Q). Its reduction\nmodulo prime powers therefore yields models of the moduli space Mdsimp (Q) over\nfinite fields, whose rational points parametrize isomorphism classes of absolutely\nsimple representations of Q of dimension vector d, where a representation is\ncalled absolutely simple if it remains simple after scalar extension to an algebraic\nclosure of the base field. The following is proved in [12]:\nTheorem 2.2 [12] For all quivers Q and all dimension vectors d \u2208 NQ0 , there\nexists a polynomial Ad (t) \u2208 Z[t] such that, for each finite field k, the number of\nk-rational points of Mdsimp (Q) equals Ad (|k|). Moreover, the polynomials Ad (t)\nare given by an explicit recursive formula.\nTo define a projectivized version of the moduli space Mdsimp (Q), we have to recall\nsome concepts of [11]. Given a representation of a reductive algebraic group G\non a complex vector space V , one has the notions of stable, resp. semistable,\npoints for the induced action of G on the projective space PV , defined as follows:\na point x \u2208 PV is called semistable if and only if for some (equivalently, for\nany) lift v \u2208 V of x, the closure of the orbit Gv does not contain 0 \u2208 V . The\npoint x is called stable if it semistable and, additionally, the orbit Gv is closed\nand of maximal possible dimension. Denote by PV ss (resp. PV s ) the set of\nsemistable (resp. stable) points of PV . Defining the projective variety Y by\nY := Proj(C[V ]G ),\nthere exists a quotient map\n\u03c0 : PV ss \u2192 Y,\nand there exists a smooth open subset U of Y such that the restriction of \u03c0\ninduces a geometric quotient\n\u03c0 : PV s \u2192 U.\nWe apply this construction of quotients to the projective space PRd (Q) of the\naffine space Rd (Q), which inherits an action of Gd . The above mentioned results\neasily imply the following:\nProposition 2.3 A point of PRd (Q) is semistable if and only if some (equivalently, any) lift to Rd (Q) does not belong to Nd (Q). The stable points are\nprecisely those x \u2208 PRd (Q) whose lifts X \u2208 Rd (Q) correspond to simple representations.\n\n5\n\n\fDefinition 2.4 We define the projectivized moduli spaces\nPMdsimp (Q) (resp. PMdssimp (Q))\nof simple (resp. semisimple) representations of Q of dimension vector d as the\ncorresponding quotients of PRd (Q)ss (resp. PRd (Q)s ) by the Gd -action, with\nquotient map \u03c0d (Q).\nThe varieties PMdssimp (Q) are introduced and analyzed in [3] as moduli spaces\nof representations of Q up to a notion of graded equivalence.\nGiven a point x \u2208 PMdsimp (Q), we call a representation X \u2208 Rd (Q) a lift of x\nif the corresponding point X \u2208 PRd (Q) maps to x via \u03c0d (Q).\nThe quiver Q is called strongly connected if and only if there exists a cycle\nthrough any given two vertices. A particular example is the quiver consisting of\na single cycle. The support supp(d) of a dimension vector d \u2208 NQ0 is defined as\nthe full subquiver on vertices i for which di 6= 0. As a direct consequence of the\nconstruction, a theorem of [10] implies the following criterion for non-emptyness\nof PMdsimp (Q):\nTheorem 2.5 [10] The space PMdsimp (Q) is non-empty if and only if the following conditions are satisfied:\n\u2022 the support of d is strongly connected, and contains at least one arrow,\n\u2022 either\n\u2013 hi, di \u2264 0 and hd, ii \u2264 0 for all i \u2208 supp(d), or\n\u2013 supp(d) is a single cycle and di = 1 for all i \u2208 supp(d).\nThe main aim of the paper is the following formula for the Euler characteristic\nin singular cohomology with compact support of PMdsimp (Q):\nTheorem 2.6 For all quivers Q and all dimension vectors d \u2208 NQ0 , we have\n\u03c7c (PMdsimp (Q)) = |Cdprim (Q)|,\nthe number of cyclic equivalence classes of primitive cycles of dimension vector\nd.\nAs already mentioned in the introduction, this theorem will be proved by localization techniques. The key ingredient is to describe the fixed point set of a\nnatural torus action on PMdsimp (Q), which will now be described.\nWe consider the torus\nTQ := (C\u2217 )|Q1 | ,\nwhose elements will be written as tuples\nt\u2217 = (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208Q1\n6\n\n\fparametrized by the arrows in Q.

Then there exists a tuple\n((N\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208Q1 , \u03c8, \u03c6),\nconsisting of a tuple of non-negative integers N\u2217 = (N\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208Q1 , a map of algebraic\ngroups \u03c6 : TQ \u2192 Gd , and a character \u03c8 \u2208 X(TQ ), such that for all t\u2217 \u2208 TQ , we\nhave\n\u03b1\n(1)\nX.(tN\n\u03b1 ) = \u03c8(t\u2217 ) * \u03c6(t\u2217 )X.\nProof: Consider the subgroup\nH \u2282 (Gd \u00d7 C\u2217 ) \u00d7 TQ\nconsisting of all pairs ((g, \u03bb), t\u2217 ) such that\nX.t\u2217 = \u03bb * gX.\nBy the assumption of x being a fixed point, the second projection p2 : H \u2192 TQ\nis surjective. Since TQ , being a torus, is connected, commutative, and consists\nof semisimple elements, the successive restrictions of p2 to the unit component\nof H, to its reductive part, and to its connected center, all have to remain\nsurjective.\nTherefore, there exists a torus T in H such that the restriction of p2 to T\nremains surjective. But any surjection of tori is quasi-split, that is, there exist\nnon-negative integers N\u03b1 for \u03b1 \u2208 Q1 and a map s : TQ \u2192 T such that\n\u03b1\n(p2 \u25e6 s)(t\u2217 ) = (tN\n\u03b1 )\n\n8\n\n\ffor all t\u2217 \u2208 TQ . Composition of s with the projection p1 : H \u2192 Gd \u00d7 C\u2217 yields\na map\np1 s = (\u03c6, \u03c8) : TQ \u2192 Gd \u00d7 C\u2217 .\nIt is now an easy verification that N\u2217 = (N\u03b1 )\u03b1 , \u03c8 and \u03c6 fulfill the claimed\nproperty.\n\u0003\nWe call a datum\n(N\u2217 = (N\u03b1 )\u03b1 , \u03c8 \u2208 X(TQ ), \u03c6 : TQ \u2192 Gd )\nassociated to a TQ -fixed point x \u2208 PMdsimp (Q) as in the above lemma (that is,\nfulfilling equation (1) for some lift X \u2208 Rd (Q) of x) a fixing datum associated\nto x.\nNow assume that a fixing datum (N\u2217 , \u03c8, \u03c6) associated to x is given, fulfilling\nequation (1) for a specified lift X \u2208 Rd (Q). We decompose \u03c6 into components\n\u03c6 = (\u03c6i : TQ \u2192 GL(Vi )).\nAssume X is given as a tuple of linear maps\n(X\u03b1 : Vi \u2192 Vj )\u03b1:i\u2192j .\nThen, by definition of the actions of TQ and Gd on Rd (Q), equation (1) can be\nreformulated as\n\u22121\n\u03b1\n(2)\ntN\n\u03b1 * X\u03b1 = \u03c8(t\u2217 ) * \u03c6j (t\u2217 )X\u03b1 \u03c6i (t\u2217 )\nfor all (\u03b1 : i \u2192 j) \u2208 Q1 and all t\u2217 \u2208 TQ .\nThe map \u03c6i provides the vector space Vi with the structure of a representation\nof TQ , for which we have the weight space decomposition\nM\nVi\u03bb ,\nVi =\n\u03bb\u2208X(TQ )\n\nwhere Vi\u03bb denotes the \u03bb-weight space of Vi for each \u03bb \u2208 X(TQ ). Formula (2)\ncan now be used to detect a kind of grading on the representation X, given by\nthe above \u03bb-weight spaces:\nLemma 3.2 For all arrows \u03b1 : i \u2192 j and all \u03bb \u2208 X(TQ ), we have\nX\u03b1 (Vi\u03bb ) \u2282 Vj\u03bb+N\u03b1 \u03b1\u2212\u03c8 .\n\n(3)\n\nProof: If v \u2208 Vi\u03bb , then \u03c6i (t\u2217 )v = \u03bb(t\u2217 ) * v by definition. Thus, for all t\u2217 \u2208 TQ ,\nwe have\n\u03c6j (t\u2217 )X\u03b1 v\n\n= \u03c6j (t\u2217 )X\u03b1 \u03c6i (t\u2217 )\u22121 \u03c6i (t\u2217 )v\n\u03b1\n= (\u03c8(t\u2217 )\u22121 tN\n\u03b1 * X\u03b1 )(\u03bb(t\u2217 ) * v)\n\u03b1\n= (\u03c8(t\u2217 )\u22121 tN\n\u03b1 \u03bb(t\u2217 )) * X\u03b1 v,\n\n9\n\n\fwhich yields the claim.\n\u0003\nThe following lemma shows that the character \u03c8 in a fixing datum is already\ndetermined by the tuple N\u2217 .\nCorollary 3.3 Given a fixing datum as above, there exists a unique primitive\nelement\nX\n\u03bd=\n\u03bd\u03b1 \u03b1 \u2208 X(TQ )\n\u03b1\n\nsuch that\n\u03c8=\n\n1 X\n\u03bd\u03b1 N\u03b1 \u03b1.\n|\u03bd| \u03b1\n\nProof: Since X belongs to PRdss (Q) by definition, there exists a cycle\n\u03c9 = (\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1s )\nat a vertex i \u2208 Q0 in Q such that\ntr(X\u03b1s * . . . * X\u03b11 ) 6= 0.\nDenote by \u03bd \u2208 ZQ1 the weight of \u03c9, thus |\u03bd| = s. By iterated application of\nLemma 3.2, we have\n(X\u03b1s * . . . * X\u03b11 )(Vi\u03bb ) \u2282 Vi\u03bc\nfor the weight \u03bc defined by\n\u03bc=\u03bb+\n\nX\n\n\u03bd\u03b1 N\u03b1 \u03b1 \u2212 s\u03c8.\n\n\u03b1\n\nBy non-vanishing of the trace of this operator, we have equality of the two\nweights \u03bb, \u03bc, and thus\n1 X\n\u03c8=\n\u03bd\u03b1 N\u03b1 \u03b1.\n|\u03bd| \u03b1\nDividing \u03bd by gcd(\u03bd\u03b1 : \u03b1 \u2208 Q1 ) if neccessary yields the existence of the desired\nelement \u03bd. Uniqueness of such an element \u03bd follows from its indivisibility.\n\u0003\nA crucial point in the description of the fixed points is the question to what\nextend a fixing datum (N\u2217 , \u03c8, \u03c6) attached to a fixed point x and a chosen lift\nX is unique.\nWe first study the effect of changing the lift X. Assume\nX \u2032 = \u03bb * g0 X\nis another lift, for a non-zero scalar \u03bb \u2208 C\u2217 and a group element g0 \u2208 Gd . It\nfollows immediately that equation (1), considered for the lift X \u2032 , is fulfilled for\nthe fixing datum\n(N\u2217 , \u03c8, g0 \u03c6g0\u22121 ).\n(4)\n10\n\n\fNext, choose a tuple m\u2217 = (m\u03b1 )\u03b1 of non-zero integers and consider the isogeny\ni : TQ \u2192 TQ defined by\nm\u03b1\n\u2217\nt\u2217 7\u2192 tm\n\u2217 := (t\u03b1 )\u03b1 .\nA direct calculation then shows that the tuple\n((N\u03b1 m\u03b1 )\u03b1 , \u03c8 \u25e6 i, \u03c6 \u25e6 i)\n\n(5)\n\nis also a fixing datum associated to x for the lift X.\nFinally, we can use the fact that the action of Gd on Rd (Q) factors through\nP Gd . This allows us to choose an arbitrary character \u03bc \u2208 X(TQ ) and to replace\nthe given fixing datum by\n(N\u2217 , \u03c8, \u03bc * \u03c6)\n(6)\nfor the same lift X of x.\nThis analysis motivates the following:\nDefinition 3.4 Two fixing data associated to a fixed point x are called equivalent if they are equivalent under the equivalence relation generated by the above\nthree operations, that is, by replacing (N\u2217 , \u03c8, \u03c6) by (4), or (5), or (6) above.\nUsing this notion of equivalence, we have:\nLemma 3.5 Any two fixing data for a TQ -fixed point x \u2208 PMdsimp (Q) are\nequivalent.\nProof: Let\n(N\u2217 , \u03c8, \u03c6), (N\u2217\u2032 , \u03c8 \u2032 , \u03c6\u2032 )\nbe fixing data for x fulfilling equation (1) for lifts X, resp. X \u2032 , of x. Since the\nmap\n\u03c0d (Q) : PRd (Q)s \u2192 PMdsimp (Q)\nis a geometric quotient, we find a non-zero scalar \u03bb \u2208 C\u2217 and a group element\ng0 \u2208 Gd such that\nX \u2032 = \u03bb * g0 X.\nThus, by operation (4) on fixing data, we can assume X \u2032 = X without loss\nof generality. We can use operation (5) on fixing data by twisting (N\u2217 , \u03c8, \u03c6)\nN\u2032\nwith the isogeny (t\u2217 7\u2192 t\u2217 \u2217 ), and similarly twisting (N\u2217\u2032 , \u03c8 \u2032 , \u03c6\u2217) with the isogeny\n\u2032\n\u2217\n(t\u2217 7\u2192 tN\n\u2217 ). This allows us, again without loss of generality, to assume N\u2217 = N\u2217 .\nSo we arrive at the following equations:\n\u2032\n\u2032\nN\u2217\n\u2217\nX.tN\n\u2217 = \u03c8(t\u2217 ) * \u03c6(t\u2217 )X, X.t\u2217 = \u03c8 (t\u2217 ) * \u03c6 (t\u2217 )X,\n\ngiving\n\u03c8(t\u2217 )\n* X = \u03c6(t\u2217 )\u22121 \u03c6\u2032 (t\u2217 )X.\n\u03c8 \u2032 (t\u2217 )\n\n11\n\n\fApplying Corollary 3.3 to both \u03c8 and \u03c8 \u2032 , we arrive at \u03c8 = \u03c8 \u2032 , and thus at\nX = \u03c6(t\u2217 )\u22121 \u03c6\u2032 (t\u2217 )X.\nBut since X is a simple representation, its automorphism group reduces to the\nscalars, so\n\u03c6\u2032 = \u03bc * \u03c6\u2032\nfor some character \u03bc \u2208 X(TQ ). Via operation (6) on fixing data, we conclude\nthe desired equivalence.\n\u0003\nDefine an auxilliary quiver \u0393 as follows: its set of vertices is\n\u03930 = Q0 \u00d7 X(TQ ),\nand for each arrow (\u03b1 : i \u2192 j) \u2208 Q1 and each \u03bb \u2208 X(TQ ), we define an arrow\n(\u03b1, \u03bb) : (i, \u03bb) \u2192 (j, \u03bb + N\u03b1 \u03b1 \u2212 \u03c8)\nin \u03931 . Moreover, we define a dimension vector eb \u2208 N\u0393 by\nebi,\u03bb := dimC Vi\u03bb .\n\nLemma 3.2 now can be reinterpreted as saying that X can be viewed as a\nrepresentation of \u0393 of dimension vector b\ne, which is neccessarily a simple representation of \u0393 since X is so. We will now show that X is already supported on\na subquiver \u0393\u2032 of \u0393 which depends only on \u03bd, and is thus independent of the\nfixing datum.\nConsider the map\nh : X(TQ ) \u2192 X(TQ ),\n\nh(\u03b1) := N\u03b1 \u03b1 \u2212 \u03c8,\n\nand recall the indivisible element \u03bd \u2208 NQ1 \u2243 X(TQ ) attached to the fixed point\nin Corollary 3.3.\nLemma 3.6 The map h induces an embedding X(TQ )/Z\u03bd \u2192 X(TQ ).\nProof: We have\nh(\u03bd) =\n\nX\n\n\u03bd\u03b1 (N\u03b1 \u03b1 \u2212 \u03c8) =\n\n\u03b1\n\nX\n\u03b1\n\nX\n\u03bd\u03b1 N \u03b1 \u03b1 \u2212 (\n\u03bd\u03b1 )\u03c8 = 0\n\u03b1\n\nby Corollary 3.3. Now assume that h(\u03bb) = 0 for a character \u03bb \u2208 X(TQ ). Again\nby Corollary 3.3, we have\nX\n\n\u03bb\u03b1 N\u03b1 \u03b1 = |\u03bb| * \u03c8 =\n\n\u03b1\n\nX |\u03bb|\n\u03b1\n\nSince all N\u03b1 are non-zero, we have\n\u03bb=\n\n|\u03bb|\n\u03bd.\n|\u03bd|\n\n12\n\n|\u03bd|\n\n\u03bd\u03b1 N\u03b1 \u03b1.\n\n\fSince \u03bd is indivisible by assumption, we conclude that \u03bb is an integer multiple\nof \u03bd.\n\u0003\nWe choose a vertex i0 \u2208 Q0 and a character \u03bb0 \u2208 X(TQ ) such that\nVi\u03bb0 0 6= 0.\nBy Lemma 3.6, we see immediately that we have an embedding of quivers\nb\u03bd \u2192 \u0393\nH :Q\n\nby defining H on vertices and on arrows via\nH0 (i, \u03bb) = (i, \u03bb0 + h(\u03b1)),\n\nH1 (\u03b1, \u03bb) = (\u03b1, h(\u03bb)).\n\nb \u03bd is so. Since X is a simple\nThe image \u0393\u2032 of H is obviously connected, since Q\nrepresentation, its support is connected and meets \u0393\u2032 by definition. We conclude that the support of X is contained in \u0393\u2032 . Thus, X can be viewed as a\nb \u03bd , whose dimension vector db is given by\nrepresentation of the covering quiver Q\ndbi,\u03bb = ebi,\u03bb0 +h(\u03bb) .\n\nNote again that the choice of \u03bd depends only on the given fixed point x by\nCorollary 3.3.\nWe finally prove that the dimension vector db is determined uniquely up to the\nb \u03bd introduced at the end of\nnotion of equivalence of dimension vectors for Q\nsection 2, for which we have to study the effect of the operations (4), (5), (6)\nb\non fixing data on the dimension vector d:\n\nObviously, operation (4) does neither affect the weights \u03bb for which Vi\u03bb 6= 0,\nnor the dimensions of the Vi\u03bb . The twist by an isogeny in operation (5) is\ncompensated for by the map h. So it remains to consider operation (6): it affects\nthe weights occuring in the weight space decomposition of all Vi by translation\nby a fixed character \u03bc, and thus affects the dimension vector eb by translation\nb which precisely defines\nby \u03bc. Thus, the same holds for the dimension vector d,\nthe notion of equivalence on such dimension vectors.\nWe summarize our present analysis of TQ -fixed points in PMdsimp (Q) by:\n\nProposition 3.7 For each fixed point x \u2208 PMdsimp (Q)TQ and each lift X of x\nto Rd (Q), there exists a unique indivisible element \u03bd \u2208 NQ1 and a unique (up\nb \u03bd lifting d, such that X can be viewed\nto equivalence) dimension vector db for Q\nb\nb\nas a simple representation of Q\u03bd of dimension vector d.\n\nIn the following section, we will formalize this way of viewing X \u2208 Rd (Q) as\na representation of a covering quiver, by embedding its projectivized moduli of\nsimple representations into the TQ -fixed points.\n\n13\n\n\f4\n\nConstruction of fixed points\n\nFix an indivisible element \u03bd \u2208 NQ1 \u2243 X(TQ ) as above, and let db be a dimension\nb \u03bd lifting a dimension vector d.

We can thus conclude that Y contains a direct sum of simple representations corresponding to all points in the TQ -orbit u.TQ of u in PMesimp (Q)\n15\n\n\fas a subrepresentation. But Y is a finite dimensional representation, and thus\nthe orbit u.TQ is finite. It is also connected, since TQ is so, and we can conclude\nthat u is a TQ -fixed point in PMesimp (Q). This in turns yields\n\u03c6(t\u2217 )U = U\nfor all t\u2217 \u2208 TQ .\nThus, we can regard each Ui \u2282 Vi as a subrepresentation of the representation\nof TQ on Vi defined by \u03c6i , and hence Ui is compatible with the corresponding decomposition into isotypical components. Since the map h is injective by\nLemma 3.6, the spaces Vi,\u03bb are precisely these isotypical components, and thus\nUi is compatible with the Vi,\u03bb , that is,\nUi =\n\nM\n(Ui \u2229 Vi,\u03bb ).\n\u03bb\n\nWe conclude that U can already by regarded as a non-zero subrepresentation of\nX, and thus U = X by simplicity of X.

Denote Y =\nP\u03bd (X) and Y \u2032 = P\u03bd (X \u2032 ). Let\n\u03b3 = (\u03b3i \u2208 GL(Vi ))i\u2208Q0\nbe an isomorphism of Y and Y \u2032 .

Choose a fixing datum (N\u2217 , \u03c8, \u03c6) such that Y and Y \u2032\nfulfill equation (2). Then, for all t\u2217 \u2208 TQ and all (\u03b1 : i \u2192 j) \u2208 Q1 , we have:\n\u03c8(t\u2217 ) * \u03c6j (t\u2217 )Y\u03b1\u2032 \u03c6i (t\u2217 )\u22121 \u03b3i\n\n=\n=\n\n\u2032\n\u03b1\ntN\n\u03b1 * Y\u03b1 \u03b3i\n\u03b1\n\u03b3j (tN\n\u03b1 * Y\u03b1 )\n\n=\n\n\u03c8(t\u2217 ) * \u03b3j \u03c6j (t\u2217 )Y\u03b1 \u03c6i (t\u2217 )\u22121 ,\n\nwhich gives\nY\u03b1\u2032 (\u03c6i (t\u2217 )\u22121 \u03b3i \u03c6i (t\u2217 )) = (\u03c6j (t\u2217 )\u22121 \u03b3j \u03c6j (t\u2217 ))Y\u03b1\nfor all \u03b1 \u2208 Q1 . Since both Y and Y \u2032 are simple representations by Proposition\n4.2, we can apply Schur's Lemma to conclude that\n\u03c6(t\u2217 )\u22121 \u03b3\u03c6(t\u2217 ) = (\u03c6i (t\u2217 )\u22121 \u03b3i \u03c6i (t\u2217 ))i\u2208Q0\n\n16\n\n\fis a scalar multiple of \u03b3 for all t\u2217 \u2208 TQ .

It is obviously injective,\nthus it defines an isomorphism\n\u223c\n\np : T \u2192 TQ .\nComposing the inverse of p with the projection of T to C\u2217 yields a character a\nof TQ such that\n\u03c6(t\u2217 )\u22121 \u03b3\u03c6(t\u2217 ) = a(t\u2217 ) * \u03b3\nfor all t\u2217 \u2208 TQ . As in the proof of Proposition 4.2, we now consider each vector\nspace Vi as a representation of TQ via \u03c6i . It is now easy to see that each \u03b3i\ninduces an isomorphism between the \u03bb-weight space and the (\u03bb + a)-weight\nspace, for each \u03bb \u2208 X(TQ ).

We proceed by downward\ninduction on |supp(d)|. The induction therefore starts with the case\n|supp(d)| = b,\nwhich means that di = 1 for all vertices i in the support of d.

In\nthis case, the moduli space reduces to a point (for example, by the dimension\nformula for the moduli space in section 2), thus the Euler characteristic equals\n1. Therefore, the claimed equality holds.\nFor the inductive step, assume now that |supp(d)| is strictly less than b, and\nb concompute the Euler characteristic by Formula 7.

The\nfourth and fifth components are single cycles, so they both contribute by 1 to\nthe overall Euler characteristic. The first component has to be further localized,\nyielding a four-cycle. Thus, we see that the Euler characteristic \u03c7c (PMdsimp (Q))\nequals 3.\n\n6\n\nComments\n\nIn this final section, we comment on the two main results Theorem 2.7 and\nTheorem 2.6 and give some examples.\nThe first comment concerns a more structural interpretation of Theorem 2.6:\nthe 0-th Hochschild homology of the path algebra of a quiver Q can be computed\nas the path algebra modulo the linear subspace spanned by commutators. It is\neasy to see that this space is spanned by cyclic equivalence classes of cycles in\nQ, thus\nM\nM\nHH0 (CQ) = CQ/[CQ, CQ] =\nC\u03c9,\nd\u2208NQ0 \u03c9\u2208Cd (Q)\n\nyielding a natural NQ0 -grading on HH0 (CQ).\nThe prominent role of the primitive cycles in the present setup then draws\nattention to a (rather weak) additional structure on HH0 (CQ), namely the p-th\npower maps Tp , mapping the cyclic equivalence class of a cycle \u03c9 to the class of\n\u03c9 p . This operation allows us to define the primitive part\nHH0 (CQ)prim\nas the subspace spanned by primitive cycles, and Theorem 2.6 can be rewritten\nin more algebraic terms as\n\u03c7c (PMdprim (Q)) = dim HH0 (CQ)prim\n.\nd\nExample: In the case of the m-loop quiver Qm , the Euler characteristic\n\u03c7c (PMdsimp (Qm )) equals the number of primitive necklaces of length d with\nbeads of m colours, a number which appears in many algebraic and combinatorial interpretations. One prominent such interpretation is the dimension of the\ndegree d-component of the free Lie algebra in m generators (see [13]). We have\nthe explicit formula:\n1X d r\n\u03bc( )m ,\n\u03c7c (PMdsimp (Qm )) =\nd\nr\nr|d\n\n22\n\n\fwhere \u03bc denotes the number-theoretic Moebius function.\nGiven this relation with the free Lie algebra L(m) , one can speculate whether\nL(m) or some related algebra might be constructed using some kind of convolution construction on the moduli spaces PMdsimp (Qm ).\nNon-emptyness of PMdsimp (Q) does not neccessarily imply non-vanishing of the\nEuler characteristic, as the following example shows:\nExample: Consider the quiver Q defined as\ni\n\n\u03b1\n\u2192\n\u2190 j\n\u03b4\n\n\u03b2\n\u2192\n\u2190 k\n\u03b3\n\nand the dimension vector d = i + j + k. The quotient map\nPRd (Q) \u2192 PMdssimp (Q)\nis given by\nP3 \u2192 P1 , (X\u03b1 : X\u03b2 : X\u03b3 : X\u03b4 ) 7\u2192 (X\u03b1 X\u03b4 : X\u03b2 X\u03b3 ).\nSimplicity of a representation is equivalent to non-vanishing of the four scalars\nrepresenting the arrows, thus\nPMdsimp (Q) \u2243 P1 \\ {0, \u221e},\nand we see that the Euler characteristic equals 0.\nGiven the description of the torus fixed point set, it is natural to ask whether it\ncan be used to find more detailed information on the cohomology of PMdsimp (Q)\nthan just the Euler characteristic. A natural approach is to use localization theorems in equivariant cohomology (see for example [7]). For these to be applicable,\nand in particular for relating the results to non-equivariant cohomology, a key\nproperty is equivariant formality of PMdsimp (Q), as defined in [7]. This property\nmeans that the TQ -equivariant cohomology\nHT\u2217Q (PMdsimp (Q))\nis a free module over the TQ -equivariant cohomology ring of a point HT\u2217Q (pt).\nIt implies the degeneration of the natural spectral sequence for equivariant cohomology, yielding\nHT\u2217Q (PMdsimp (Q)) \u2243 H \u2217 (PMdsimp (Q)) \u2297 HT\u2217Q (pt).\nIn continuation of the above example, we see that equivariant formality does\nnot hold in the present situation:\nExample: The torus TQ acts transitively on the quotient P1 \\ {0, \u221e} by\n(x : y).(t\u03b1 , t\u03b2 , t\u03b3 , t\u03b4 ) = (t\u03b1 t\u03b4 x : t\u03b2 t\u03b3 y),\n23\n\n\fwith stabilizer of 1 \u2208 P1 being the subtorus\nT := {(t\u03b1 , t\u03b2 , t\u03b3 , t\u03b4 ) : t\u03b1 t\u03b4 = t\u03b2 t\u03b3 }.\nSo the TQ -equivariant cohomology of PMdsimp (Q) is\nHT\u2217Q (PMdsimp (Q)) \u2243 HT\u2217Q (TQ /T ) \u2243 HT\u2217 (pt),\nconsidered as a module over HT\u2217Q (pt) via the restriction map. Thus, the equivariant cohomology HT\u2217Q (PMdsimp (Q)) is a torsion module over HT\u2217Q (pt), whereas\nthe non-equivariant cohomology H \u2217 (PMdsimp (Q) is two-dimensional, with onedimensional components in degrees 0 and 1.\nThe inductive proof of Theorem 2.6 in section 5 ultimately computes the Euler\ncharacteristic of PMdsimp (Q) by reduction to the case of single cycle quivers,\nthus detecting a special kind of grading on certain representations. It is therefore natural to consider the class of simple representation, which one might call\nstring representations, defined as follows:\nDefinition 6.1 Suppose a primitive cycle\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u03c9 : i0 \u21921 i1 \u21922 . . . \u2192s is = i0\nof dimension vector d in Q is given. Define a simple representation S\u03c9 of Q of\ndimension vector d as follows:\nFor each vertex i \u2208 Q0 , define\nKi = {k = 0, . . . , s \u2212 1 : ik = i}.\nConsider a di -dimensional vector space Vi with basis elements bk for k \u2208 Ki .\nFor each arrow (\u03b1 : i \u2192 j) \u2208 Q1 and each k \u2208 Ki , define\n\u001a\n\u001b\nbk+1 , \u03b1 = \u03b1k+1 ,\n(S\u03c9 )\u03b1 (bk ) =\n0\n, otherwise.\nThe reduction procedure of section 5 morally means that the finitely many representations S\u03c9 for primitive cycles of weight d are the only ones \"responsible\"\nfor (some aspects of) the global topology of PMdsimp (Q).\n\nReferences\n[1] M.
