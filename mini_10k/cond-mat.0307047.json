They display semiconducting or metallic properties depending on\nthe helicity of the tubule [1], what is a useful feature to\nbuild electronic devices. The electron correlations are\nsignificant in the metallic nanotubes [2\u20135], explaining\nthe experimental observation of features characteristic of\nLuttinger liquid behavior [6,7]. Quite remarkably, superconducting correlations have been also observed, in the\nform of the proximity effect [8,9] as well as in the sharp\ndecrease of the resistance at low temperatures [10].\n\nall the possible interactions in the scaling procedure will\nallow us to investigate the development of 3D coherence\nin the rope, as well as to discover new phases which correspond to different charge instabilities in the system.\n\n1\n1\n\n1\n-i\n\n1\ni\n\n1\n-1\n\n1\n-1\n\n1\n-i\n\n1\ni\n\n1\n1\n\n() () () ()\n\n() () () ()\n\n-kF\n\nkF\n\nE\n\nThe superconducting transitions reported in Ref. [10]\nhave been measured in various samples of nanotube\nropes. These are supposed to be made of a large number (\u223c 300) of single-walled nanotubes, and in all cases\nthe critical temperature has been found below 1 K. In a\ndifferent kind of experiment [11], strong superconducting\ncorrelations have been observed in individual nanotubes\nof very small diameter placed in a zeolite matrix. It has\nbeen claimed that such correlations should correspond to\na critical temperature of the order of \u223c 15 K [11].\n\nFIG. 1. Plot of the low-energy linear branches of carbon\nnanotubes. The spinors in the inside (outside) correspond\nto the relative electron amplitudes in the two sublattices of\ngraphene rolled up to form a zigzag (armchair) nanotube.\n\nElectron-phonon interactions.- The effective interaction coming from the exchange of phonons may lead\nto attraction or repulsion between the electrons, depending on the particular channel of interaction considered\n[16,17]. We will follow the convention of classifying the\nfour-fermion interactions into different channels with re(j)\nspective coupling constants gi [18]. The lower index\ndiscerns whether the interacting particles shift from one\nFermi point to the other (i = 1), remain at different\nFermi points (i = 2), or they interact near the same Fermi\npoint (i = 4). The upper label follows the same rule\nto classify the different combinations of left-movers and\nright-movers, including the possibility of having Umklapp processes (j = 3).\nLet us focus on the opposite cases of armchair and\nmetallic zigzag nanotubes [1]. All of them have two pairs\nof linear branches in their band structure, crossing at\nrespective points at the Fermi level (for undoped nanotubes) as shown in Fig. 1. Obviating the momentum dependence of the electron modes, the relative amplitudes\nbetween points in the two sublattices of the honeycomb\n\nAn explanation of the superconductivity (SC) in the\nnanotube ropes has been already proposed [12,13]. It has\nbeen argued that, as long as the Cooper pairs are formed\nat zero total momentum, they do not find the obstacle\nthat single electrons have to tunnel between neighboring nanotubes due to the misalignement of the lattices\n[14,15]. The existence of a superconducting transition is\npossible in the ropes as the coherence in the transverse\ndirections is established through the tunneling of Cooper\npairs between the nanotubes [13]. In this scenario it has\nbeen assumed that the screening of the Coulomb repulsion is the dominant effect in large nanotube ropes and\nthat the backscattering and Umklapp interactions are not\nessential to explain the SC of these systems.\nIn this Letter we propose a new computational framework to deal simultaneously with the Coulomb screening\ndue to the intertube interactions and the scaling of all the\nintratube interactions in the low-energy theory. In this\nway we will obtain a precise estimate of the critical temperatures that can be reached. The interplay between\n1\n\n\flattice are given by the spinors in Fig. 1 [19].\nUsing the fact that the electron modes with opposite\nmomenta have complex conjugate amplitudes, it can be\nshown that the contributions from phonon exchange to\n(1) (2) (1) (2)\n(1)\ng1 , g1 , g2 , g2 and g4 are negative, for frequencies\nbelow the characteristic phonon energy. However, the\n(3) (3)\ncontributions from Umklapp processes to g1 , g2 and\n(3)\ng4 have the opposite sign, since the respective products\nof electron-phonon couplings turn out to be negative [17].\nWe recall that the electron-phonon couplings are given by\na sum involving products of electron modes in nearest(2)\nneighbor sites [16]. Thus, the contributions to g4 and\n(4)\ng2 have attractive character in the zigzag nanotubes,\ndue to the relation of conjugation between the electron\nmodes, but they have repulsive character in the armchair\nnanotubes, since only one of the two scattered modes\nreverses its sign there when shifting to a neighboring site.\nThe signs of the different contributions are based on\nsymmetry rules, and they hold irrespective of whether the\nexchanged phonons are optical or acoustic. The energy\nof the latter at momentum 2kF is close to the energy of\noptical phonons near k = 0, so that we will assume equal\nstrength in absolute value, |g|, for all the four-fermion\ninteractions arising from the exchange of phonons with a\ntypical Debye frequency between 0.1 and 0.2 eV.\nWe will deal with effective interactions coming from\nthe exchange of phonons within the same nanotube. Interactions mediated by the exchange of phonons in different nanotubes require mainly the coupling of out-of-plane\nphonons, which have a much lower energy scale. These\neffects have been studied in Ref. [20], with the result that\nthe intratube superconducting order parameter is more\nrelevant than the intertube one, when the system is in\nthe regime with dominant attractive interactions.\nCoulomb screening.- Regarding the Coulomb interaction, it has been shown that the strength of the\nbackscattering and Umklapp processes mediated by the\nCoulomb potential is reduced by a relative factor \u223c\n0.1 a/R, in terms of the ratio of the lattice spacing a to\nthe nanotube radius R [2\u20134]. This means that, for typical nanotubes in a rope, these processes can be safely\nneglected in favor of the contributions from phonon exchange, whenever the strength in absolute value |g| of\nthe latter is above \u223c 0.05vF . Therefore, the competition\nbetween the long-range Coulomb interaction and the effective interaction from phonon exchange takes place in\nthe channels with small momentum transfer correspond(4)\n(2) (4) (2)\ning to the couplings g2 , g2 , g4 and g4 .\nDealing for the time being with such small momentumtransfer interactions, the dressed vertices are given by\nself-consistent equations of the type shown in Fig. 2.\nIt has to be realized that, in the case of a rope, there\n(j)\nare interaction vertices Di for currents within the same\n(j)\nnanotube as well as interaction vertices Vi between cur-\n\nrents at different metallic nanotubes. If the number of\nthem is n, this is also the number of different terms in\nthe sum that appears in Fig. 2.\n\ng(j)i\n\nDi(j)\n=\nla\n\n+\nla\n\nlb\n\n\u03a3l\nc\n\nlb\n\ng(j)i\n\nla\n\nDi(j),Vi\nlc\n\n(j)\n\nlb\n\nFIG. 2. Diagrams contributing to the screening of Coulomb\ninteractions between currents la , lb of well-defined chirality\nand spin inside a rope. The second term takes into account\nthe polarization of the n metallic nanotubes in the rope.\n(j)\n\nThe self-consistent equations for the intratube Di\n(j)\nvertices can be solved in the\nand the intertube Vi\nsame fashion as for the simpler case of the Luttinger\nmodel [21]. In order to obtain a solution in the form\nof coupling constants, we have taken the static approximation in the polarization operators. We have also\nchosen an average strength for the Coulomb potential\nv = (e2 /2\u03c0) log |kc /k0 |, where kc is the short-distance\ncutoff and k0 \u223c 10\u22123 kc accounts for the long-distance\naverage.\n(4)\nThe appropriate bare values of the couplings are g4 =\n(2)\n(2)\n(4)\nv + g, g4 = v \u2213 g, g2 = v + g and g2 = v \u2213 g, where\ng < 0 is the contribution from phonon exchange. The\nupper sign applies to the armchair nanotubes and the\nlower sign to the zigzag nanotubes. In the former case,\nthe solution of the self-consistent equations is\n(4)\n\n(2)\n\n(2)\n\n(4)\n\n(4)\n\n(2)\n\n(2)\n\n(4)\n\n2v\n1 + 4nv/\u03b50 \u03c0vF\n2g\n=\n1 + 4g/\u03b50 \u03c0vF\n\nD4 + D4 = D2 + D2 =\nD4 \u2212 D4 = D2 \u2212 D2\n\n(1)\n(2)\n\nIn the case of the zigzag nanotubes, we have\n(j)\n\nDi\n\n=\n\nv + g + 4g(nv + g)/\u03b50 \u03c0vF\n(1 + 4g/\u03b50 \u03c0vF )(1 + 4(nv + g)/\u03b50 \u03c0vF )\n\n(3)\n\nfor all of the four dressed couplings. The effect of the\nCoulomb screening is well captured in the expression of\nthe dressed vertices. The RPA-like diagrams considered\nscreen repulsive interactions and enhance attractive interactions, and the latter always prevail for sufficiently\nlarge values of n. For 4|g|/\u03b50\u03c0vF close to 1, strong nonperturbative effects arise from the same kind of singularity already observed in the bosonization picture [22,13].\nThe limit n \u2192 0, g \u2192 0 recovers the bare vertices used\nin precedent studies of SC in isolated nanotubes [17,18].\nIntratube scaling equations.- The preceding\nphysical description has to be completed by incorporating the effect of the backscattering and Umklapp effective\ninteractions arising from phonon exchange. We set the\nsigns of their respective initial strengths (equal to |g| in\n2\n\n\f(2)\n\nabsolute value) according to the above discussion, and\ntake into account their nontrivial scaling behavior when\nthe frequency probe is progressively reduced. The couplings scale according to anomalous dimensions which\n(j)\ncan be written in terms of the dressed couplings Di .\nTo second order in the backscattering and Umklapp couplings, the scaling equations read\n(2)\n\n\u2202g1 /\u2202l =\n\n(1) (1)\n\n(3) (1)\n\n(3) (2)\n\n+g2 g1 + g4 g1 )\n1\n1\n(1)\n(2)\n(2) (1)\n(1) (2)\n\u2202g2 /\u2202l =\n(D4 \u2212 D2 )g2 +\n(g g\n\u03c0vF\n\u03c0vF 4 1\n(1) (1)\n\n(3) (3)\n\n(3) (3)\n\n(1) (3)\n\n(3) (2)\n\n(3) (1)\n\n(3) (1)\n\n(3) (1)\n\n(3) (2)\n\n(2)\n\n(9)\n\nwhere tT is the intertube hopping for each particle of\nthe Cooper pair, of the order of \u223c 0.01 eV. We recall that the tunneling amplitude for single electrons is\nin general much smaller than this quantity, due to the\nmismatch between the Fermi points of neighboring nanotubes [14]. This introduces a factor of suppression that\nsets the single-particle intertube hopping about three orders of magnitude below the estimate for tT [15].\nIf the generalized backscattering and Umklapp processes are fixed to zero, the system is at the fixed point described in the bosonization picture [13]. That fixed point\nis in general unstable against chirality-breaking perturbations by which the system flows to a strong-coupling\nfixed point. Nevertheless, the crossover behavior is very\nslow, being characterized by a relatively small crossover\nfrequency \u03c9xo . In a large region of the phase diagram the\nflow is cut off by the onset of the 3D coherence before \u03c9xo\nhas been reached. In these conditions, the SC phase remains in the region of influence of the weak-coupling fixed\npoint, which governs then the main physical properties.\nResults and discussion.- Following the above approach, we characterize the superconducting transition\nby looking for a pole \u03c9c in the 3D propagator R(\u03c9) of\nthe Cooper pairs along the rope. This is related to the SC\nresponse function R(0) (\u03c9) in the individual nanotubes by\n \u0303\nthe Schwinger-Dyson equation 1/R(\u03c9) = 1/R(0) (\u03c9) \u2212 J,\n \u0303\nwhere J is the (dimensionless) pair hopping measured in\nunits of the high-energy cutoff.\nMoreover, we can study the competition between the\nSC and other charge instabilities in the rope by rebosonizing the system at each step in the integration of\nEqs.

The scaling equation for J is [23]\n\n(7)\n\n(3) (2)\n\n\u22122g2 g2 + g1 g2 + g2 g1 + g1 g1 ) (8)\nwhere l stands for (minus) the logarithm of the energy\nscale measured in units of the high-energy cutoff Ec (of\nthe order of \u223c 0.1 eV). These equations are similar to\nthose obtained in Ref. [18], except for the replacement\n(2) (4) (4)\n(2)\nof g2 , g2 , g4 and g4 by the respective dressed couplings. We apply this replacement to the rest of the\nequations in the model, including those for the small\nmomentum-transfer couplings, which we do not write\nsince they are similar to those in Ref. [18]. In this way we\nincorporate the finite renormalizations arising from the\ninteraction among the metallic nanotubes in the rope,\nwhich set the initial values of the dressed couplings in\naccordance to Eqs. (1)\u2013(3).\nIntertube coherence.- The ropes are made of nanotubes with different helicities and diameters, and this\ncompositional disorder frustrates the formation of any\nphase with spin-density-wave or charge-density-wave order in the rope. On the other hand, the nanotubes\nmay have strong superconducting correlations. Their\nstrength is given by the combination of the couplings\n(2) (1) (1)\n(2)\nD2 , g1 , g2 and g1 , which govern the propagation\nof the Cooper pairs along each nanotube. The interac(1)\n(1)\ntions corresponding to g1 and g2 are always attractive,\npointing at the enhancement of the superconducting correlations with s-wave symmetry at low energies.\nIn the compositionally disordered ropes, the coherence\nis established by the tunneling of Cooper pairs between\nneighboring metallic nanotubes. The amplitude J for\nthis process has a dependence on the energy scale characterized by the anomalous dimension \u2206, given by the\n\nWe obtain complementary information about the physical properties of the system by studying the regions where\nthe K\u00b1 parameters either vanish or diverge. This happens when some of the functions given by Eq. (10) develops a branch-cut at some energy scale, what has to be\nunderstood as the onset of a phase transition in the system. The different phases which arise in this approach\nhave been represented in Fig. 3, where contour lines of\nconstant critical scale \u03c9c have been also plotted.\nThe weak-coupling character of the SC phase allows to\nestimate the transition temperatures from the values of\nthe pole \u03c9c shown in Fig. 3. The comparison with the experiments reported in Ref. [10] can be made by recalling\n3\n\n\fstrong coupling in the channel of the mismatch of charge\nin the two gapless subbands. These divergences have\nthe same character of the Wentzel-Bardeen singularity,\nwhich is the natural counterpart of the superconducting\ninstability [22,20]. A divergent compressibility implies\nthat the density-density correlations become increasingly\nlarge, pointing at the onset of a regime where there is no\nhomogeneous descripition of the system. For sufficiently\nstrong attraction, the electronic charge finds then more\nfavorable its macroscopic segregation than the formation\nof Cooper pairs. We have shown that such a phase may\nbe observable in ropes, either as a consequence of a strong\nattractive interaction or, in doped systems, from the decoupled behavior of the metallic nanotubes at weak coupling, for temperatures slightly below 1 K.\n\nthat the ropes used there have about 100 metallic nanotubes, while the transition temperatures measured are\nalways below 1 K. When compared to the high-energy\ncutoff, that value corresponds to lc \u2248 7. From the results shown in Fig. 3, we find that the strength of the\nattractive interaction 4|g|/\u03c0vF has to be \u2248 0.3.\n\n1\n0.8\n\n1\n\nK--1 =0\n\n0.6\nG\n\nSC\n\n0.4\n\nK--1 =0\n\n0.8\n0.6\nG\n\nSC\n\n0.4\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\nK+ =0\n\n40\n\n80 120 160 200\nn\n\nK+-1 =0\n\n40\n\n80 120 160 200\nn\n\nFIG. 3.

[10]. That is, for nanotubes with a\ntypical diameter of \u2248 1.4 nm, the effect of the Coulomb\ninteraction overcomes any source of effective attraction\nfor that range of n. This is in agreement with the experimental measures carried out by the collaboration of Ref.\n[10] in thin ropes with about 40 nanotubes [24].\nThe lower boundary of the SC phase in Fig. 3 almost\ncoincides with the boundary at which the pair-hopping\namplitude ceases to grow large at low energies. When this\nhappens, the nanotubes in the rope start to behave as uncoupled 1D systems, what explains the disappearance of\nthe superconducting transition. A phase with vanishing\ncompressibility appears for low values of |g| in the undoped system. The fact that the regime with K+ = 0 is\nonly present at half-filling makes clear that it corresponds\nto the extension of the Mott insulating phase found in the\nstudies of carbon nanotubes with respulsive interactions\n[4,5]. In the case of doped nanotubes, the repulsive Umklapp interactions are not present in the system, and the\ndecoupling of the nanotubes in the rope leads instead to\na phase with divergent compressibility in the channel of\nthe total charge, as shown in Fig. 3.\nAnother phase with divergent compressibility arises at\n4\n\n\f"}
