The technique accounts for the combined effects of all detector components in a single measurement. The calibrated 2.5 m diameter light source fills the aperture, providing uniform illumination to each\npixel. The known flux from the light source and the response of the acquisition system give the required calibration for each pixel. In the lab, light source uniformity is studied using CCD images and the intensity is\nmeasured relative to NIST-calibrated photodiodes. Overall uncertainties are presently 12%, and are dominated\nby systematics.\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe reconstruction of air shower longitudinal profiles and the ability to determine the total energy of a reconstructed shower depend on being able to convert ADC counts to a light flux at the aperture for each channel that\nreceives a portion of the signal from a shower. To achieve this objective, it is necessary to have some method\nfor evaluating the response of each pixel to a given flux of incident photons from the solid angle covered by\nthat pixel, including effects of aperture projection, optical filter transmittance, reflection at optical surfaces,\nmirror reflectivity, pixel light collection efficiency and area, cathode quantum efficiency, PMT gain, pre-amp\nand amplifier gains, and digital conversion.\nWhile this response could be assembled from independently measured quantities for each of these effects, the\nAuger FD calibration group is using an alternative method in which the cumulative effect is measured in a\nsingle end-to-end calibration. The technique is based on a portable 2.5 m diameter drum-shaped light source\nwhich mounts on the exterior of the FD apertures (see Fig. 1), providing a pulsed photon flux of known intensity\nand uniformity across the aperture and simultaneously triggering all the pixels in the camera.\nThe absolute calibration of the drum light source intensity is based on a set of UV enhanced Si photodetectors,\n\nFigure 1. A schematic showing the drum mounted in a telescope aperture, and a picture of the drum being raised into\nposition.\n\n\f2\n\nP. Bauleo et al.\n\ncalibrated at NIST [1]. While the small surface area and low response of these detectors preclude detection of\nthe small photon flux from the drum surface directly, the NIST calibration can be transferred to a more sensitive\nPMT/DAQ system. Prototype work is described in Ref. [2]; the current procedure is presented here, including\na more direct calibration of the drum intensity.\nIdeally, this calibration would occur at many wavelengths in the N2 spectrum, between 300 and 400 nm,\nand at several intensities. At present, the system is single-wavelength, using UV LEDs emitting in a narrow\nband around 375 nm. Modifications to the present system are under construction to allow multi-wavelength\ncalibration, using a Xenon light source, light guide and bandpass filters.\n\n2.\n\nLight source and drum\n\nThe light source consists of a pair of pulsed UV LEDs [3] (375 \u00b1 12 nm) mounted coaxially in a 2.5 cm\ndiameter x 2.5 cm long teflon cylinder. A silicon detector attached to the end of the cylinder monitors the\nrelative light output for each pulse of the LEDs. This source is mounted in a 15 cm diameter reflector cup.\nThe cup is mounted flush to the center of the drum front surface, illuminating the interior of the 2.5 m diameter\ncylindrical drum, 1.4 m deep. The lightweight drum, shown in Fig. 1, was constructed in sections, using\nlaminations of honeycomb core and aluminum sheet. The sides and back surfaces of the drum interior are lined\nwith Tyvek, a material diffusively reflective in the UV. The front face of the drum is a 0.38 mm thick Teflon\nsheet, which transmits light diffusively.\n\n3.\n\nDrum relative uniformity measurements\n\nUniformity of light emission from the drum surface is important, since the pixels in an Auger fluorescence\ndetector camera view the aperture at varying angles. In addition, for each pixel, a different part of the aperture\nis blocked by the camera itself. So studies were made of uniformity of emission across the surface and as a\nfunction of viewing angle.\nThese uniformity measurements were made using a CCD, viewing the emitting surface of the drum from a\ndistance of 14 m (see Fig. 2). Images were recorded with the drum axis at angles of 0, 10, 20 and 25 degrees\nrelative to the CCD axis, covering the range of the Auger telescope field of view (0\u2013210). For these images,\nthe UV LEDs were powered continuously.\nThe 00 image was used to analyze the uniformity of emission over the drum surface. Using software, concentric\ncircles were drawn on the image, defining annular regions of increasing radius, as shown in the figure. The\nintensity of the pixels in each region was analyzed to obtain the intensity as a function of radius. In the area\ndefined by the 2.2 m aperture radius, the relative uniformity of intensity is constant over the area to about \u00b12%.\nThe variation with viewing angle of a section of the drum image is also shown in Fig. 2.\nThe fact that the drum intensity decreases at larger radii and that the area viewed decreases as cos\u03b8 with viewing\nangle is partly compensated for by the location of the camera shadow for pixels in different parts of the camera.\nCentral pixels view the fuller 00 area but the more intense center of the drum is shadowed; large angle pixels\nand those in the corners of the camera see a reduced area, but the camera shadow moves off-center, exposing\nmore of the brighter drum center.\nThe small drum non-uniformities that are measured (diagonal stripes in Fig. 2, intensity decrease with radius,\netc.) indicate that the FD pixels see similar intensities integrated over the drum surface. While perfect drum\nuniformity is desirable, non\u2013uniformities which are small and well mapped over the surface of the drum are\n\n\f3\n\nAbsolute Calibration of the Auger Fluorescence Detectors\n\n250\n200\n\n800\n\n4%\n\nRing 1\nRing 2\nRing 3\nRing 4\n\no\n\n0\no\n20\no\n25\n\n600\n\n150\n\n400\n\n100\n\n200\n\n50\n0\n\n2000\n\n2200\n\n2400\n\nIntensity [a.u.]\n\n2600\n\n0\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\n2500\n\nIntensity [a. u.]\n\nFigure 2.

A ray-tracing program using the uniformity and angular intensity information from the CCD\nimages shows less than 1% variation in total flux seen by the pixels, and corrections are applied for these\nvariations.\n\n4.\n\nDrum calibration\n\nTo establish the absolute flux of photons emitted from the drum surface, a reference PMT is placed on the drum\naxis, 14 m from the surface. The LED light source in the drum is pulsed for a series of 5 \u03bcs pulses and the\ncharge from the PMT is integrated and recorded for each pulse, resulting in a histogram of the distribution of\nthe observed integrated flux.\nOn an optical bench, the PMT is then exposed to a small diffuse LED light source of adjustable intensity similar\nto that of the drum. The LEDs are pulsed with the same driving circuitry as for the drum, and the intensity\nis set to a series of values producing a series of histograms with centroids surrounding that from the drum\nmeasurement, above. At each of these intensity settings a second measurement is made in which the PMT is\nreplaced by the NIST-calibrated photodiode and a neutral density filter in the source is removed, increasing the\nintensity to a level measurable by the photodiode. For this second measurement, the LEDs are run in DC mode.\nThe relationship of PMT response to photodiode current is found to be very linear. The flux of photons at 14\nm from the drum surface is then calculable from the active area of the photodiode, the neutral density filter\nreduction factor, the LED pulsed/DC duty factor, the NIST calibration for the photodiode, and the value of\nphotodiode current corresponding to the PMT-drum centroid, as interpolated from the linear response-current\nrelationship above.\n\n5.\n\nCalibration Results\n\nUse of the drum for gain adjustment and calibration provides a known, uniform response for each pixel in\na detector as shown for one camera in Fig. 3. The typical sensitivity for Auger FD pixels is approximately\n5 photons per ADC count. At present, the absolute calibration is performed every three months. The longterm variations of camera response are typically within 2% of the calibration and are associated with several\nfactors, including gain shifts due to PMT exposure to varying night sky intensities during the previous few\n\n\f4\n\nP. Bauleo et al.\n\nnights of data taking. These small variations in pixel response are tracked several times per night by a relative\ncalibration system, and appropriate corrections for each pixel are entered daily in the analysis database (see\nassociated Auger paper in this ICRC [4]). The absolute calibration as described here has been checked for\nsome pixels using remote laser shots at 337 and 355 nm [5].\n\nPhotons/(ADC count)\n\n7\nBefore flat-fielding\nAfter flat-fielding\nAfter 3 months\n\n6\n5\n4\n3\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\nPixel Number\nFigure 3.

This is dominated by reflections\nfrom the UV filter back to the teflon face of the drum.

This is a 2% effect; 1% uncertainty.\nWhile the general technique of Auger FD calibration is now well established, the equipment and detailed\nprocedures are still evolving. Recent improvements of the lab optical equipment will improve the overall\nuncertainties in the next calibration. At present, uncertainties total 12% and are dominated by contributions\nassociated with the optical setup in the lab (10%) and a conservative estimate of the nightly variations (5%).\nUncertainties of about 8% are achievable.\n\nReferences\n[1] National Institute of Standards and Technology, U.S. Dept. of Commerce, Calibration Program, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-2330; NIST Special Publication 250-41, 1998.\n[2] J.
