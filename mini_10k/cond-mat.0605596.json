We\nattribute them to mesoscopic transport in narrow channels across the grain boundary line. The\nThouless energy appears to be the relevant energy scale. Our findings have significant implications\non quasiparticle relaxation and coherent transport in HT S grain boundaries.\n\nJunctions are extremely useful to test very important properties of high critical temperature superconductors (HT S) [1, 2, 3], whose nature has not yet\nbeen completely established [4].Recently high quality\nYBa2 Cu3 O7\u2212\u03b4 (Y BCO) grain boundary (GB) Josephson junctions (JJs) have given the first evidence of potentials to study exciting crucial issues such as macroscopic\nquantum behaviors, coherence and dissipation [5, 6]. The\nquantum tunnelling of such macroscopic d \u2212 wave devices out of zero voltage state has been demonstrated\nalong with the quantization of its energy states. The\ncross-over temperature between quantum and classical\nregimes was found to be of the order of 40 mK. This\nis evidence of the fact that despite the short coherence\nlengths in a highly disordered environment and the presence of low energy (nodal) quasiparticles ( qps) due to\nthe nodes of the d \u2212 wave order parameter symmetry\n[1, 3, 5], dissipation in a HT S junction does not seem to\nbe as disruptive for the quantum coherence at low temperatures, as one would naively expect. Increasing the\navailable information about the nature of qps and their\nrelaxation processes is of crucial importance to unveil the\nmechanism which leads to superconductivity in HT S.\nIn this letter we report on transport measurements of\nY BCO biepitaxial (BP ) GB junctions (see scheme in\nFig. 1a), which give evidence of conductance fluctuations (CF s ) in the magneto-conductance response of\nHT S junctions. To our knowledge, this is the first time\nthat CF s are measured in HT S junctions. Our results\nprove the appearance of mesoscopic effects in the unusual\nenergy regime kB T << \u01ebc < eV < \u2206. Here kB T is the\nthermal energy at temperature T , \u01ebc is the Thouless energy introduced below, V is the applied voltage and \u2206 is\nthe superconducting gap (\u2248 20 meV for YBCO [1]).\nThe progress registered in mesoscopic physics in the\nlast two decades is impressive[7, 8, 9, 10]. At low tem-\n\nperatures, quantum coherence can be monitored in the\nconductance G of a normal metallic sample of length Lx\nattached to two reservoirs. The electron wave packets\nthat carry current in a diffusive wire have minimum size\nof the order of LT > Lx >> l . Here l is the electron\nmean free path\np in the wire and LT is the thermal diffusion length h\u0304D/kB T (D is the diffusion constant).\nThe first inequality is satisfied at relatively low temperatures as far as kB T << \u01ebc \u2261 h\u0304D/L2x . At low voltages (eV << \u01ebc ), the system is in the regime of universal conductance fluctuations: the variance < \u03b4g 2 >\nof the dimensionless conductance g = G/2e2 /h\u0304 is of order of unity. Mesoscopic phenomena have been widely\ninvestigated even in metallic wires interrupted by tunnel junctions [11] and in Josephson junctions[12, 13, 14].\nIn experiments on N b/Cu/N b long junctions [14], phase\ncoherence mediated by Andreev reflection at the S/N interfaces, has been shown to persist in the whole diffusive\nmetallic channel, several hundreds of nm long. Such an\neffect is robust with respect to energy broadening due\nto temperature, but it is expected to be fragile to energy relaxation processes induced by the applied voltage.\nBy contrast, in our case, the qp phase coherence time \u03c4\u03c6\nseems not to be limited by energy relaxation due to voltage induced non-equilibrium. Mesoscopic resistance oscillations are found even for eV > \u01ebc , indicating that qps\ndo not loose coherence at low temperatures, while diffusing across the N bridge. By plotting the auto-correlation\nfunction of the measured CF in magnetic field H (see\nbelow), we determine \u01ebc , in analogy to similar studies of\nnormal metal and semiconductor systems [10, 15]. It is\nvaluable that HT S GB JJs make accessible this regime,\nwhich is not commonly achieved by conventional metals\nand junctions, providing a \"direct\" measurement of the\nThouless energy.\n\n\f2\n\nI(\u03bcA)\n\n150\n\n30G-60G: step 1.5G\n148\n\n11.8\n\n12\n\n12.2\n\nV(mV)\n\nc)\nFIG. 1: (a) Sketch of the grain boundary structure for three different interface orientations.

In biepitaxial\njunctions, the impurities may be due to Yttrium excess. (c) I \u2212 V curves as a function of the magnetic field H: the Fraunhofer\npattern indicates a uniform interface with critical current density JC \u223c 8 \u00d7 104 A/cm2 at T = 4.2 K. In the inset, a few I \u2212 V\ncurves are displayed at different magnetic fields (from 30 G to 60 G, step 1.5 G) at high voltages to give a better evidence of\nthe fluctuations of the resistance.\n\nIn low-Tc JJs, RN represents the resistance at a voltage a few times larger than the gap values. This matter\nis more delicate when dealing with HT S JJs, because\nof the deviations from the ideal RSJ-like behavior [2, 3].\n\n0.1\n\n\u2206R/R\n\n0.08\n\n0.06\n0.04\n\n190\n\n300\n\n600\n\n900\n\n1200\n\n1500\n\nT(mK)\n\nRN(\u03a9)\n\nThe BP JJs are obtained at the interface between a\n(103) Y BCO film grown on a (110) SrTiO3 substrate\nand a c-axis film deposited on a (110) CeO2 seed layer\n(Fig. 1a). The presence of the CeO2 produces an additional 45\u25e6 in-plane rotation of the Y BCO axes with\nrespect to the in-plane directions of the substrate. By\nsuitable patterning of the CeO2 seed layer, the interface\norientation can be varied and tuned to some appropriate\ntransport regime (in Fig. 1a we have indicated the two\nlimiting cases of 0\u25e6 and 90\u25e6 , and an intermediate situation defined by the angle \u03b8, in our case \u03b8 = 60\u25e6 ) [6, 16].\nWe have selected junctions with sub-micron channels, as\neventually confirmed by Scanning Electron Microscope\nanalyses, and measured their I \u2212 V curves, as a function of H and T . We have investigated various samples,\nbut here we focus mostly on the junction characterized by\nthe Fraunhofer magnetic pattern shown in Fig. 1c, where\nit is more likely that only one uniform superconducting\nchannel is active [17]. In Fig.1c the I/V curves are reported in a 3d\u2212plot as a function of magnetic field H.\nThe critical current (IC ) oscillations point to a flux periodicity which is roughly consistent with the typical size\n(10 \u2212 100 nm) that we expect for our microbridge from\nstructural investigations ( see Fig. 1b). We have to take\ninto account that the London penetration depth in the\n(103) oriented electrode is of the order of a few microns\n(much larger than the one in c-axis YBCO films)(see [5]\nfor instance).\n\n185\n\n180\n\n-200\n\n-100\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\nH(G)\n\nFIG. 2: Resistance RN vs H at T = 300 mK. Marked non\nperiodic fluctuations are evident. In the inset, the zero field\namplitude of the fluctuations is reported vs T .\n\nIn our case a linear branch typical of the RSJ behavior\nstarts at V = 5 mV . Values of V between 10 mV and\n15 mV are representative for the problem we are investigating (see the inset of Fig. 1c). The average resistance\nRN over the whole magnetic field range is \u223c 182 \u03a9. We\nchoose V \u2248 12 mV for deriving the RN vs. H curve, that\nis reported in Fig. 2 at the temperature T = 300 mK in\nthe interval [\u2212200 G, 200 G]. AC magneto-conductance\nmeasurements basically give the same results, but provide a more reliable Fourier transform, as we will discuss elsewhere. The dynamical resistance is measured at\nfixed bias current. Conductance fluctuations, as those\nshown in Fig. 2 become appreciable at temperatures below 900 mK (kB T << h\u0304IC /2e), in\np the whole magnetic\nfield range. Their amplitude is h(\u03b4G)2 i \u223c 0.07 GN\n\n\f3\n(with GN \u2261 (RN )\u22121 ) at 300 mK and are more than\none order of magnitude larger than the noise. Below\n1.2 K, the fluctuations are nonperiodic, and for sure not\nrelated to the IC (H) periodicity, and have all the typical\ncharacteristics of mesoscopic fluctuations. The pattern\nshows occasionally some hysteresis mostly at high magnetic fields, when sweeping H back, which we attribute\nto some delay in the magnetic response. Above 1.2 K,\nthermal fluctuations dominate (see the inset in Fig. 2).\nBy performing the ensemble average of GN over H,\nadditional insights can be gained. The auto-correlation\nfunction is defined as:\n\u2206G(\u03b4V ) =\nq\nX\n1\n(GV +\u03b4V (H) \u2212 GN )(GV (H) \u2212 GN )\n=\nNV\nV\n\nH\n\nFIG. 3: The autocorrelation function of Eq.(1) is derived from\nexperimental data for different temperatures.

In the inset of Fig. 3 the full line\np shows\nthe best fit obtained by using Eq.(2) with \u2206\u03c6 = e\u03b4V /\u01ebc\nand \u03be = 0.1. This value of \u03be = 0.1 is consistent with a\nLx value of the order of 50 nm. The value of \u01ebc can be\nread out of the plot from the location of the node, giving\n\u01ebc of the order of 3 meV . Our plots can be compared\nto the ones of ref.[11] obtained for a Al/Al2 O3 /Al tunnel\njunction at T = 20mK, V = 0.8mV in a magnetic field\nH = 0.5T esla which drives the junction into the normal\nstate. In ref.[11], the energy broadening extracted from\n\n\f4\nthe experiment, \u223c max{h\u0304/\u03c4\u03c6 , \u01ebc }, is 2.3 \u03bceV , at 20mK.\n\u00012\nIn our case, < \u2206\u03c6 >\u2248 e\u03b4V /\u01ebc \u223c 1 fixes the scale\nof amplitude of the voltage fluctuations \u03b4V for carriers\ndiffusing across the bridge. It is remarkable that the coherence time which is expected when dephasing is dominated by small-energy-transfer (Nyquist) scattering of\nnodal qps ( \u223c h\u0304/V [19]) is much shorter than h\u0304/\u01ebc . The\nvoltage drop appears to occur mainly away from the microbridge as the electrochemical potential cannot change\nsignificantly over distances smaller than the wave packet\nsize [20, 21]. We have found that both temperature and\nbias voltages up to 30 meV reduce the amplitude of the\nCF s ( see the inset of Fig. 2)rand of \u01ebc , but they do not\nD\n\u00012 E\ndrops with\nwash out the correlations.\n\u03b4G/GN\n\nIn conclusion, we have given evidence of conductance\nfluctuations in HT S grain boundary Josephson Junctions\nconstricted by one single micro-bridge at low temperatures. CF s are the signature of a coherent diffusive\nregime. Our results seem to suggest an unexpectedly long\nqps phase coherence time and represents another strong\nindication that the role of dissipation in HTS has to be\nrevised.\nWork partially supported by the ESF projects \"\u03a0Shift\" and \"QUACS\" and by MIUR funds (Italy).

Nazarov are\ngratefully acknowledged.\n\ntemperature, according to eq.(2) as probed from the experiment (see inset of Fig.2).\n\nGiven that the thermal diffusion length LT \u223c 0.13 \u03bcm\nat 1 K (with D \u223c 20 \u00f7 24 cm2 /sec for Y BCO[22]), the\ncondition Lx < LT is certainly met, thus confirming\nthat \u01ebc is the relevant energy scale. The phase coherence\nlength exceeds the size of the microbridge and therefore\nthermal decoherence can be ruled out. Hence, not only\nthe interference of tunnelling currents takes place, which\nprovides the Fraunhofer pattern of Fig. 1 c, but also the\nquantum interference of electrons returning back to the\njunction in their diffusive motion at the GB. We believe,\nthis is the first time that the wave-like nature of the carriers fully appears in HT S systems and that mesoscopic\nscales can be identified.\nAs a final remark, our measurements show that \u01ebc is the\nrelevant energy scale for the supercurrent as well. Indeed,\nwe find that eIc RN and \u01ebc are of the same order of magnitude, in agreement with the typical values measured\nin HT S JJs [2, 3] and the results on diffusive phasecoherent normal-metal SN S weak links [14, 23]. This\nfeature gives additional consistency to the whole picture,\nrelating the critical current, which is mediated by subgap\nAndreev reflection, with the transport properties at high\nvoltages. The coherent diffusive regime across the S/N/S\nchannel of our GB junctions persists even at larger voltage bias \u2206 > eV > \u01ebc and is the dominating conduction\nmechanism. Hence, microscopic features of the weak link\nappear as less relevant, in favour of mesoscopic, non local properties. The results define important attributes\nof the role of grain boundaries in the transport in HT S\njunctions and in particular of the narrow self-protected\nchannels formed in the complex growth of the oxide grain\nboundary [2, 3, 24, 25]. The fact that the dominant energy scale is found to be \u01ebc \u223c 3 meV sets a lower bound\nto the relaxation time at low T for qps of energy even\nten times larger, of the order of picoseconds. It has been\nargued that antinodal qps may require slow diffusive drift\nof momentum along the Fermi surface towards the nodes\nof the d \u2212 wave gap [22, 26].\n\n[1] C.C. Tsuei and J.R.
