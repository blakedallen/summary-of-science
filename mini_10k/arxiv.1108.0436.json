Compared to conventional methods,\ntt improves quality of products and reduces processing\ntime1 . The most striking experimental result is the possibility to sinter metal parts directly by microwaves without the assistance of microwave susceptors5\u20137 .\nIt is well known that good electrical conductors reflect\nmost of incident microwave power. For example, semiinfinite copper slab irradiated at frequency f = 2.45 GHz\nreflects about 99.98% of incident power. The rest of\npower is dissipating owing to Joule loss. The high reflectivity is caused by significant macroscopic current induced by the time varying magnetic field component. In\nmetal powders the current is suppressed, and this promotes the microwave heating2\u20134 . In turn, bulk metals can\nbe heated by microwaves with assistance of microwave\nsusceptors, which convert microwave energy into thermal energy, and heat surroundings in conventional way.\nOwing to high reflectivity, the metal parts by microwaves\nwithout susceptors was unbelievable up to recent experiments.\nFirst theoretical explanations of microwave experiments with metal powders and parts utilized surface\nimpedance concept and assumed the use of either microwave susceptors or perfect thermal insulation8,9 . They\nhad demonstrated the principal possibility of the microwave heating of metal parts but didn't provide insight\ninto the conditions of the above experiments. This paper presents another approach. Instead of calculations of\nMaxwell's equations coupled with the heat equation, it\nuses the concept of energy balance to scan the parameters\naffecting the heating. This scan points to the conditions\nfavorable for successful experiments and outlines the region of interest for further investigations.\nThe concept of energy balance is originated from the\nheat equation:\n\u03c1C\u03c1\n\ndT\n= \u2207 (\u03ba\u2207T ) + P+ (r, T ) \u2212 P\u2212 (Ts ).\ndt\n\n(1)\n\nHere, T is the sample temperature; \u03c1, C\u03c1 and \u03ba are\nthe mass density, specific heat capacity and thermal conductivity of the sample, respectively; P+ is the volume\n\na) Electronic\n\nmail: mignat@isc.chubu.ac.jp\n\ndensity of dissipating microwave energy per unit time at\nspace point r and P\u2212 determines the heat loss through\nthe sample surface due to radiation and convection\n\u0001\n4\nP\u2212 (Ts ) = Aerad \u03c3SB Ts4 \u2212 Tsurr\n+ Ah (Ts \u2212 Tsurr ) ,\n(2)\nwith A is the sample area to volume ratio, erad is the\nemissivity, \u03c3SB = 5.67 \u00d7 10\u22128 J/(s*m2 *K4 ) is the StefanBoltzmann constant, and h is the convection heat transfer coefficient; the surrounding temperature Tsurr and\nthe surface temperature Ts are in the Kelvin scale.\nThe diffusion term tends to equalize the temperature\nprofile inside of the sample, and it can be neglected when\nthe temperature is almost uniform. Non-uniform temperature complicates heat transport analysis and makes\nquestionable the basis of the approach used in this paper. Fortunately, in small metal parts as well as low-loss\ndielectrics, variation of the temperature profile is significantly reduced.\nDuring microwave heating, the main source of nonuniform temperature profile is the non-uniform source\nof heat. The variation of temperature \u2206T due to the\nvariation of dissipating power \u2206P+ is estimated as10\n\u2206T \u223c T\n\n\u2206P+ \u03c4s\n,\nP+ \u03c4T\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03c4T \u223c T /(\u2202T /\u2202t) is the characteristic time of heating, and characteristic time scale of temperature equalization is given by\n\u03c4s =\n\n\u039b2\n,\n\u03c7\n\n(4)\n\nwith \u039b is the space scale of P+ variation and \u03c7 = \u03ba/(\u03c1C\u03c1 )\nis the thermal diffusivity of material.\nIn the case of good electrical conductors \u2206P+ /P+ \u223c 1.\nFor metal samples with size of a one centimeter, \u03c4s is typically within a range from 0.1s to 1s. Under these conditions, the heating rate slower than 10 C/s causes temperature non-uniformity less than 10 C, and therefore the\ndiffusion term in Eq. (1) can be ignored. In the case of\nellipsoidal low-loss dielectrics, \u2206P+ \u223c 0 and therefore\ntemperature non-uniformity is zero.\nThe negligibly small diffusion term allows to formulate the statement of the concept of energy balance: the\nsaturated temperature is determined by balance between\nheat source P+ and heat loss P\u2212 , and when P+ \u2212 P\u2212 > 0\n\n\f2\n\n\u03c3(T )\n,\n\u03c9\n\n\u03c30\n,\n1 + \u03b2(T \u2212 T0 )\n\n(6)\n\nwith \u03c30 = 5.8 \u00d7 107 1/(\u03a9*m) is the electrical conductivity at temperature T0 = 250 C, and \u03b2 = 0.0042 is the\ntemperature coefficient.\nEmissivity of the sample depends on surface conditions. The sum of emissivity and reflectivity equals to\nunity by Kirchoff's law. From everyday experience it is\nknown that clear metal surface is bright while oxide layer\ntarnishes the surface. This points to small emissivity of\nclear metal compared to that of oxidized surface. For\nexample, the emissivity of clear copper sample is taken\nto be 0.03, and that of oxidized copper is 0.8012 .\nIn calculations, sample radius is 5 mm, and the amplitudes of the electromagnetic field are typical for singlemode cavity experiments (104 \u223c 105 V/m), i.e. they are\nhigher than typical strength of the electromagnetic field\nutilized in multimode cavities.\nPower balance expressed in watts (Q = P * Vs , where\nVs is the sample volume) is shown in Figure 1. Results\nof calculations clearly demonstrate that oxidized copper\nsample is hard to heat even by strong electromagnetic\nfield. Radiation heat loss limits the maximum temperature of the sample at 4000 C when T \u2212 Tsurr = 50 C\n[Fig. 1(a)]. In the case of larger loss, the sample is not\nheated at all.

This concept\nsignificantly reduces the complexity of the problem.\nThe paper assumes that in heat loss term P\u2212 radiation\nloss dominates and therefore h = 0.\nIn order to simplify the calculations of dissipating\npower, one need to make additional assumptions. The\nfirst assumption is that the sample size is much less than\nthe microwave wavelength in cavity, such that the nonuniformity of the electromagnetic field is negligible and\nthe microwave heating by a plane running wave is considered. The next assumptions regard material properties and sample shape: permittivity and permeability are\nuniform, and the sample is spherical. In this case, the\namount of the power dissipated in the sample is easily\ncalculated by means of Mie theory11 .\nFinally, the problem of three dimensional numerical\nsolution of Maxwell's equations is reduced to the calculation of Mie coefficients, and the problem of heat transport is reduced to the investigation of energy balance\nP+ \u2212 P\u2212 .\nIn order to calculate Mie coefficients, one need to specify optical parameters of sample. In the case of copper,\nthe magnetic permeability is \u03bcs = \u03bc0 , while the dielectric\npermittivity \u03b5s is determined by the electric conductivity\n\u03c3 and microwave frequency f as\n\nE0= 1e4V/m\nE0= 5e4V/m\nE0=10e4V/m\n\n0\n\n200\n400\n600\n800\nsample temperature [0C]\n\n1000\n\nFIG. 1.

For example, if\nT \u2212 Tsurr = 500 C, the clear sample is heated almost up\nto 8000 C when E0 = 5 \u00d7 104 V/m, and maximal temperature is higher than 10000C when the magnitude of the\nelectric field increased by two times E0 = 10 \u00d7 104 V/m.\nThe obtained data provide a key for understanding of\nexperimental results.

In experiments, the surface is cleared when the sample is preheated in reducing atmosphere or vacuum. For\nexample, in hydrogen atmosphere the reduction of metal\nM from oxide Mx O2 is governed by\nMx O2 (s) + 2H2 (g) = xM (s) + 2H2 O(g),\n\n(7)\n\nwhere x represents the stoichiometry of the oxide; (s)\nand (g) stand for \"solid\" and \"gas\", respectively. The\nequilibrium ratio of hydrogen to water partial pressures\nPH2 /PH2 O is determined by the change of Gibbs energy\nfor the reaction \u2206G:\nln\n\n\u2206G\nPH2\n=\n,\nPH2 O\nRT\n\n(8)\n\nwith R = 8.314 J/(K*mol) is the gas constant and T is\nthe absolute temperature.\nAssuming that input gas atmosphere consists of 5%\nH2 and 95% of neutral gas, corresponding equilibrium\npartial pressure of water is shown in Figure 2. Dashed\nhorizontal line shows the level of moisture maintained in\nthe experiments estimated based on measured dew point\nTD = \u2212600 C by means14\n2\n3\n+5.05*10\u22127TD\n.\nlog10 (VH2 O ) = \u22120.24+0.03TD\u22121.74*10\u22124TD\n(9)\nThe calculated moisture contents VH2 O = 10\u22123 vol.%\ncorresponds to partial pressure PH2 O /Pref \u2248 10\u22125 . The\n\ncalculations show that preheating of copper and monoxide of iron is highly effective for the reduction of sample\nsurface from oxide. The reduction of chrome, titanium\nand aluminum oxides is not so easy and requires much\nhigher temperature and/or more stringent moisture control.\nIn summary, the microwave heating of metal parts is\npossible owing to non-trivial prerequisite experimental\nprocedure, when the surface of sample is cleared from\noxides during preheating in reducing atmosphere. This\nprocedure significantly reduces radiation heat loss, and\nmakes possible the temperature rise, provided the strong\nelectromagnetic field and good thermal insulation. The\nheat is produced by Joule loss owing to eddy current.\nThis paper considered the heating of bulk copper.\nCompared to copper, many common metals important\nfor applications, like Ni, Fe and steels, possess lower electrical conductivity (Table I). Besides, their magnetic\nproperties are favorable for microwave heating. They\ndissipate more microwave power, and thus they are good\ncandidates for microwave heating experiments. In addition, Fe and Ni are reduced from oxides easily in hydrogen\natmosphere (diagram for Ni is not shown).\nThis work was performed under the support of a\nGrant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Priority Area\nNo.18070005 (FY2006-2010) from the Japan Ministry of\nEducation, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology.\n1 R.\n\nRoy, D.
