Remarkable\nprogress in recent years has resulted from the observation that the gluon density of the\nsmall x part of the hadron wavefunction, the relevant piece for high energies, grows rapidly\nas x decreases [1, 2]. When the gluon density increases, important non-linear phenomena\nare expected, which should eventually lead to saturation [3, 4, 5, 6], that is, to a limitation\nof the maximum gluon phase-space density. At saturation, this density is expected to be\nof order 1/\u03b1s [3, 7, 8], since interactions among the gluons will cutoff further growth\nonce the interaction energy is comparable to the kinetic energy. For such a large density,\nperturbation theory breaks down even if the coupling constant is small, because of strong\nnon-linear effects.\nOn dimensional grounds, the square of the typical momentum scale associated with\nsaturation is expected to be of the order of the density of gluons per unit area [5]. If\nthis saturation momentum Qs is large enough (Qs \u226b \u039bQCD ), then the saturation regime\nis characterized by weak coupling \u03b1s (Q2s ) \u226a 1 and large occupation numbers \u223c 1/\u03b1s\nwhich, by the correspondence principle, is a classical regime. This motivated McLerran\nand Venugopalan to describe the gluon component of the hadronic wavefunction at small\nx as a stochastic classical Yang-Mills field [5], subsequently interpreted as a \"Color Glass\nCondensate\" (CGC) [9]. This has the advantage that the non-linear physics at saturation\ncan be studied in the simpler setting of a classical field theory, via a combination of\nanalytic [5, 10, 11, 7, 8] and numerical methods [12].\nIn the McLerran-Venugopalan (MV) model, all the dynamical information about the\n\"fast\" partons (i.e., the partons with longitudinal momenta p+ larger then the scale \u039b+ =\nxP + of interest5 ) is encoded in a probability distribution for the classical color field\n+\ndescribing the \"soft\" gluons (i.e., the gluons with momenta k + <\n\u223c \u039b ). In principle,\nthis probability distribution can be computed in perturbation theory, by integrating out\nthe fast quantum modes in layers of p+ , to leading order in \u03b1s ln(1/x), but to all orders\nin the strong classical background field [7]. This results in a functional renormalization\ngroup equation (RGE) which describes the evolution of the probability density with the\nseparation scale \u039b+ . The formal structure of this equation has been first presented in\nRefs. [13], and further discussed in Refs. [14, 9], but previous attempts [14] to compute\nthe coefficients in this equation have suffered from technical complications and, moreover,\nappear to be inconsistent [15] with the results obtained from perturbative QCD [16, 17].\nIn a parallel development due to Balitsky [16] and Kovchegov [17], the evolution of\nWilson line operators has been studied within the operator product expansion and the\ndipole model of Mueller [18]. This has led to a set of coupled evolution equations for the\nexpectation values of these operators [16], which decouple only in the large N limit [17]\nwith N the number of colors. (See also Refs. [19] for some recent attempts towards solving\n5\n\nThroughout, we consider the hadron in\n\u221a frame, and use light-cone vector\n\u221a its infinite momentum\nnotations, v \u03bc = (v + , v \u2212 , v\u22a5 ), with v + \u2261 (1/ 2)(v 0 + v 3 ), v \u2212 \u2261 (1/ 2)(v 0 \u2212 v 3 ), and v\u22a5 \u2261 (v 1 , v 2 ). The\nhadron four-momentum reads P \u03bc = (P + , 0, O\u22a5 ), with P + \u2192 \u221e, while soft gluons have k + = xP + , with\nx \u226a 1.\n\n1\n\n\fthese equations.) In a recent paper [20], Weigert has shown that Balitsky's equations can\nbe summarized as a functional evolution equation for the generating functional of the\nWilson line operators. As we shall show in this paper, this is precisely the equation which\ngoverns the evolution of the probability distribution for the CGC.\nSpecifically, our main purpose in this Letter is to present explicit expressions for the\ncoefficients in the RGE describing the quantum evolution of the CGC [13]. The details\nof our calculation, which relies heavily on the formalism developed in Ref. [9], will be\npresented somewhere else [21].\nWe start by briefly reviewing the MV model and its quantum evolution (see [9] for a\nrecent comprehensive discussion). In the infinite-momentum frame, and to the order of\ninterest, the fast (p+ > \u039b+ ) partons can be replaced by a classical color source, with color\ncharge density \u03c1a (x), moving along the light-cone (z = t or x\u2212 = 0) in the positive x+\ndirection. Via the Yang-Mills equations:\n(D\u03bd F \u03bd\u03bc )a (x) = \u03b4 \u03bc+ \u03c1a (x) ,\n\n(1)\n\n+\nthis source determines the classical color field A\u03bca which describes the soft (k + <\n\u223c \u039b )\ni\ngluons. In the saturation regime, the source and the fields are strong, A \u223c \u03c1 \u223c 1/g, and\nthe classical problem is fully non-linear.\n\nThe structure of \u03c1a (x) is largerly determined by kinematics: Since generated by shorthwavelength modes, with momenta p+ > \u039b+ , \u03c1 is localized near x\u2212 = 0, within a distance\n+\n+\n\u2206x\u2212 <\n\u223c 1/\u039b ; it is static (i.e., independent of the LC time x ) since the soft gluons have\na comparatively short lifetime \u2206x+ \u223c 1/k \u2212 \u221d k + \u221d x, during which the dynamics of the\n\"fast\" partons can be ignored; it is a random quantity, since this is the instantaneous color\ncharge of the fast partons \"seen\" by the shortlived soft gluons at some arbitrary time.\nThe spatial correlators of the classical source \u03c1a (~x) (with ~x \u2261 (x\u2212 , x\u22a5 )) are inherited\nfrom the (generally time-dependent) quantum correlations of the fast gluons, via the\nrenormalization group equation to be presented below. They are encoded into a weight\nfunction for \u03c1a (~x), denoted as W\u039b [\u03c1], which is assumed to be gauge-invariant, and which\ndepends upon the separation scale \u039b+ (see below).\nPhysical quantities like the gluon distribution function are most directly related to\ncorrelations functions of the transverse fields Ai in the light-cone (LC) gauge A+\na = 0. In\n+\nthe MV model, the correlations functions at the scale \u039b are obtained as:\nhAia (x+ , ~x)Ajb (x+ , ~y ) * * *i\u039b =\n\nZ\n\nD\u03c1 W\u039b [\u03c1] Aia (~x)Ajb (~y ) * * * ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere Aia \u2261 Aia [\u03c1] is the solution to eq. (1) in the LC gauge, and is implicitely given by\nthe following equations (the other components of the solution vanish: A+ = A\u2212 = 0):\ni\nAi (~x) =\nU(~x) \u2202 i U \u2020 (~x),\ng\n\u2020\n\n\u2212\n\n(\n\nU (x , x\u22a5 ) = P exp ig\n\nZ\n\nx\u2212\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u2212\n\na\n\n\u2212\n\ndz \u03b1 (z , x\u22a5 )T\n\n\u2212\u22072\u22a5 \u03b1(~x) = U \u2020 (~x) \u03c1(~x) U(~x) \u2261 \u03c1\u0303(~x) .\n2\n\na\n\n)\n\n,\n(3)\n\n\fThere are a few important remarks about this classical field:\na) The equations (1)\u2013(2) above are those for a glass (here, a color glass): There is a\nsource, and the source is averaged over. This is entirely analogous to what is done for\nspin glasses when one averages over background magnetic fields [22].\nb) The solution Ai (x) is a two-dimensional pure-gauge (in the sense that F ij = 0), but not\nalso a four-dimensional pure-gauge, since the associated electric field F +i = \u2202 + Ai is nonvanishing. In fact, Ai (x) is the gauge transform with gauge function U(~x) of the solution\n\u00c3\u03bc in the covariant gauge \u2202 \u03bc \u00c3\u03bc = 0 (COV-gauge), which reads simply \u00c3\u03bc = \u03b4 \u03bc+ \u03b1 with\n\u03b1(~x) satisfying:\n\u2212 \u22072\u22a5 \u03b1(~x) = \u03c1\u0303(~x) ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03c1\u0303(~x) is the color source in the COV-gauge.\nc) Eq. (3) expresses the LC-gauge solution Ai as an explicit functional of the COV-gauge\nsource \u03c1\u0303 : Aia \u2261 Aia [\u03c1\u0303]. On the other hand, its dependence upon the LC-gauge source \u03c1\nis not known explicitly. This, together with the gauge-invariance of the weight function\nW\u039b [\u03c1], suggests that it is more convenient to perform the functional averaging in eq. (2)\nby integrating over \u03c1\u0303 (rather than \u03c1).\nd) In writing eq. (3), we have chosen \"retarded\" boundary conditions in x\u2212 : Ai (x\u0303) \u2192 0\nfor x\u2212 \u2192 \u2212\u221e .\ne) We shall see later that the source \u03c1\u0303 (and therefore also the \"Coulomb\" field \u03b1) has\n\u2212\n+\nsupport at 0 <\n\u223c x <\n\u223c 1/\u039b . Thus, when probed by fields with a poor longitudinal\nresolution (i.e., which carry momenta k + \u226a \u039b+ ), the configuration (3) appears effectively\nas a \u03b8-function in x\u2212 :\nAi (x\u2212 , x\u22a5 ) \u2248 \u03b8(x\u2212 )\n\ni\nV (\u2202 i V \u2020 ) \u2261 \u03b8(x\u2212 )Ai\u221e (x\u22a5 ),\ng\n\n(5)\n\nwith Ai\u221e (x\u22a5 ) the asymptotic field, and\n\u2020\n\n\u001a\n\nV (x\u22a5 ) \u2261 P exp ig\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\n\u001b\n\ndx \u03b1(x , x\u22a5 ) ,\n\n(6)\n\n+\nwhere the integral over x\u2212 runs effectively up to x\u2212\nmax \u2243 1/\u039b (since \u03b1 vanishes for larger\n\u2212\nvalues of x ). On the same resolution scale, the electric field appears as a \u03b4\u2013function:\n\nF +i (~x) \u2261 \u2202 + Ai \u2248 \u03b4(x\u2212 ) Ai\u221e (x\u22a5 ).\n\n(7)\n\nIn the original MV model, eqs. (1)\u2013(2) are simply postulated, and the weight function\nW\u039b [\u03c1] is not computed from first principles. Indeed, the physical origin of the large gluon\ndensities, namely the quantum evolution towards small x, is absent from the model. But in\nRefs. [13, 14, 9], one has shown that the MV model is indeed consistent with the quantum\nevolution, which entails a renormalization group equation (RGE) for the running of W\u039b [\u03c1]\nwith \u039b. This is the same quantum evolution which in the weak field regime leads to the\nBFKL equation. But for small enough x, when one is close to saturation, this evolution\n3\n\n\ftakes place in the strong background field Ai generated at the previous steps. When\nAi \u223c 1/g, the mean field effects are non-perturbative, and must be included exactly.\n\nTo describe the quantum evolution, consider a sequence of two classical effective theories (\"Theory I\" and \"Theory II\") valid at the scales \u039b+ and b\u039b+ , respectively, with\nb < 1 and such as \u03b1s ln(1/b) < 1. To the order of interest, the gluon correlations at the\nlower scale b\u039b+ can be computed in two ways: As classical correlations within Theory\nII (which is valid at this scale), or by allowing for quantum fluctuations in Theory I and\nintegrating out the \"semi-fast\" quantum gluons with longitudinal momenta in the strip\nb\u039b+ < |p+ | < \u039b+ ,\n\n(8)\n\nto leading order in \u03b1s ln(1/b), but to all orders in the background fields and sources.\n(See Refs. [13, 9] for the quantum generalization of the MV model.) The difference\n\u2206W \u2261 Wb\u039b \u2212 W\u039b , and therefore the evolution equation for W\u039b , can be then obtained\nby matching these two calculations [9]. The explicit matching performed in Ref. [9]\nshows that it is indeed possible to absorb the effects of the semi-fast gluons on the soft\ncorrelation functions into a renormalization of the weight function for the effective theory.\nThis is in agreement with the original conjecture in Refs. [7, 13], and justifies the use of\nthe McLerran-Venugopalan model as an effective theory at small x.\nThe RGE is most naturally written in the LC-gauge, where the quantum effective\ntheory is defined. It reads6 (with \u03c4 \u2261 ln(P + /\u039b+ ) and d\u03c4 \u2261 ln(1/b)) [13, 9] :\n\u2202W\u03c4 [\u03c1]\n\u03b4\n1\n\u03b42\nab\n= \u03b1s\n[W\n\u03c7\n]\n\u2212\n[W\u03c4 \u03c3xa ]\n\u03c4\nxy\n\u2202\u03c4\n2 \u03b4\u03c1a\u03c4 (x\u22a5 )\u03b4\u03c1b\u03c4 (y\u22a5 )\n\u03b4\u03c1a\u03c4 (x\u22a5 )\n(\n\n)\n\n(9)\n\nwith the coefficients \u03c3xa \u2261 \u03c3a (x\u22a5 ) and \u03c7ab\nxy \u2261 \u03c7ab (x\u22a5 , y\u22a5 ) related to the 1-point and 2-point\nfunctions of the color charge \u03b4\u03c1a (x) of the semi-fast gluons via the following relations:\n1\n\u03c3a (x\u22a5 ) \u2261\ndx\u2212 h\u03b4\u03c1a (x)i ,\nb\nZ\nZ\n1\n\u03b1s ln \u03c7ab (x\u22a5 , y\u22a5 ) \u2261\ndx\u2212 dy \u2212 h\u03b4\u03c1a (x+ , ~x) \u03b4\u03c1b (x+ , ~y)i ,\nb\n\u03b1s ln\n\nZ\n\n(10)\n\nwhere the brackets denote the average over quantum fluctuations in the background of\nthe tree-level color fields Ai .\n\nNote that \u03c3 and \u03c7 are two-dimensional densities in the transverse plane; the longitudinal structure of the relevant charge correlators has been integrated over. This is consistent\nwith our picture of the quantum evolution where the semi-fast gluons are unable to discriminate (because of their low p+ momenta) the longitudinal structure of the source. For\nthis picture to be validated, however, one still has to check that \u03c3 and \u03c7 are not sensitive\nto the internal structure of the source (see below).\n6\n\nWe use \u03c4 to denote the rapidity variable, \u03c4 = ln(1/x), rather than the more common notation y to\navoid confusion with the space-time coordinate y. Also, we use compact notations, where repeated color\nindices (coordinate variables) are understood to be summed (integrated) over.\n\n4\n\n\fThere is nevertheless a trace of this longitudinal structure in eq. (9): the functional\nderivatives there are to be taken with respect to the color source \u03c1a\u03c4 (x\u22a5 ) \u2261 \u03c1a (x\u2212 =\n1/\u039b+ , x\u22a5 ) in the highest bin of rapidity (\u03c4, \u03c4 +d\u03c4 ), that is, at x\u2212 in the range (1/\u039b+ , 1/b\u039b+ ).\nThis is so since, as we shall shortly discover, the quantum corrections have support in\nthat range. This longitudinal structure is important to make the functional derivatives in\neq. (9) well defined [9] (see also eq. (35) below).\nEq. (9) is a functional Fokker-Planck equation describing diffusion in the functional\nspace spanned by \u03c1 with \"drift velocity\" \u03b1s \u03c3 and \"diffusion constant\" \u03b1s \u03c7. Since \u03c3 and \u03c7\nare generally non-linear functionals of \u03c1 (see below), eq. (9) is equivalent with an infinite\nset of coupled evolution equations for the correlators of \u03c1. For these equations to be\nuseful, the functionals \u03c3[\u03c1] and \u03c7[\u03c1] have to be known explicitly. To this aim, it is more\nconvenient to use the COV-gauge source \u03c1\u0303 (rather than the LC-gauge source \u03c1) as the\nindependent variable. Indeed, \u03c3 and \u03c7 depend upon the color source via the classical field\nAi which is known explicitly only in terms of \u03c1\u0303 (cf. eq. (3)).\n\nAs explained in Ref. [9], when going from the LC-gauge to the COV-gauge, the\ninduced color charge \u03c3 acquires a new contribution, in addition to the color rotation with\nmatrix U \u2020 . This is so because the transformation between the two gauges depends upon\nthe charge content in the problem: this was \u03c1 at the initial scale \u039b+ , thus giving a gauge\ntransformation U \u2020 [\u03c1], but it becomes \u03c1 + \u03b4\u03c1, with fluctuating \u03b4\u03c1, at the new scale b\u039b+ ,\nthus inducing a fluctuating component in the corresponding gauge function U \u2020 [\u03c1 + \u03b4\u03c1].\nAfter averaging out the quantum fluctuations, one is left with a RGE for W\u03c4 [\u03c1\u0303] which is\nformally similar to eq. (9), but with \u03c1 \u2192 \u03c1\u0303, \u03c7 \u2192 \u03c7\u0303, and \u03c3 \u2192 \u03c3\u0303, where:\n\u03c7\u0303ab (x\u22a5 , y\u22a5 ) \u2261 Vac\u2020 (x\u22a5 ) \u03c7cd(x\u22a5 , y\u22a5 ) Vdb (y\u22a5 ), \u03c3\u0303a (x\u22a5 ) \u2261 Vab\u2020 (x\u22a5 ) \u03c3b (x\u22a5 ) \u2212 \u03b4\u03c3a (x\u22a5 ),\nZ\n1\ng abc\nd2 y\u22a5 \u03c7\u0303cb (x\u22a5 , y\u22a5 ) hy\u22a5 |\n|x\u22a5 i .\n(11)\nf\n\u03b4\u03c3a (x\u22a5 ) \u2261\n2\n\u2212\u22072\u22a5\nThe correction \u2212\u03b4\u03c3, to be referred to as the \"classical polarization\", is the result of the\nquantum evolution of the gauge transformation to the COV-gauge.\nIt is our purpose in this Letter to present explicit expressions for the quantities \u03c7\u0303 and\n\u03c3\u0303 as functionals of \u03c1\u0303, and thus completely specify the RGE for W\u03c4 [\u03c1\u0303]. The Feynman rules\nfor the calculation of these quantities have been already presented in Refs. [13, 9]. They\ninvolve the propagator\n\u03bc\n\u03bd\niG\u03bc\u03bd\nab (x, y)[A] \u2261 hT aa (x)ab (y)i\n\n(12)\n\nof the semi-fast gluons a\u03bc in the presence of the background fields Ai and in the LCgauge a+ = 0 (where the quantum theory is a priori formulated [13, 9]). In Ref. [9], this\npropagator has been constructed to all orders in the background field, by exploiting the\nspecial geometry of the latter (see also Refs. [23, 24]). One of the subtle points in this\nconstruction has been the choice of a gauge condition (i.e., of an i\u01eb prescription for the\npole in 1/p+ in the gluon propagator) to fix the residual gauge freedom in the LC-gauge.\n5\n\n\fThis is important since the general results for \u03c7 and \u03c3 turn out to be dependent upon\nthis prescription7 .\nFor consistency with the retarded boundary conditions imposed on the classical solution (3) and with the assumed longitudinal structure of the original color source (which,\n\u2212\n+\nwe recall, has support at positive x\u2212 only, with 0 <\n\u223cx <\n\u223c 1/\u039b ), we shall integrate out the\nquantum fluctuations by using a retarded i\u01eb prescription in the LC-gauge propagator (see\nRef. [9] for details). We have verified that the same results for \u03c7 and \u03c3 would be eventually obtained also by using an advanced prescription [21]. On the other hand, we have not\nbeen able to give a sense to calculations with principal value or Leibbrandt-Mandelstam\nprescriptions.\nConsider the induced source \u03c3 first. Up to some tadpoles (i.e., contributions proporR\ntional to d2 p\u22a5 /p2\u22a5 ) which cancel anyway in the final result, this is obtained from\n\u0010\n\nh\u03b4\u03c1a (x)i = gf abc h(\u2202 + aib (x))aic (x)i = gTr T a \u2202x+ Gii (x, y)\n\n\u0011\n\nx=y\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u2261 Tr T a h\u03b4\u03c1(x)i , (13)\n\nwhere the equal-time limit of the time-ordered propagator (12) is taken as y + = x+ + \u01eb [9].\nEq. (13) can be evaluated as follows (more details will be given in Ref. [21]): The relevant\ncomponent of the propagator Gii (x, y) (the only one to give a non-vanishing contribution\nto h\u03b4\u03c1i) can be read off eq. (6.35) of Ref. [9], which gives (omitting tadpoles once again):\nh\u03b4\u03c1(x)i = \u2212ighx|D i\n\n1 ++ \u2020i\n\u01f4 D |xi,\ni\u2202 +\n\n(14)\n\nwhere D i \u2261 \u2202 i \u2212igAia T a and D \u2020j = \u2202 \u2020j +igAj with the derivative \u2202 \u2020j acting on the function\non its left. In eq. (14), \u01f4++ (x, y) is a component of the background-field propagator in\nthe temporal gauge \u00e1\u2212 = 0, which enters at intermediate steps in the construction of the\npropagator in the LC-gauge [9]. It is given by eqs. (6.22) and (6.13) of Ref. [9] as:\n\u01f4\n\n++\n\n2i\n(~x, ~y ; p ) = \u2212\np\n\u2212\n\nZ\n\nd3~z \u2202xi G0 (~x \u2212 ~z, p\u2212 ) \u03b4(z \u2212 ) \u2202yi G0 (~z \u2212 ~y , p\u2212 )\n\nn\n\no\n\n\u00d7 \u03b8(x\u2212 )\u03b8(\u2212y \u2212 )V (x\u22a5 )V \u2020 (z\u22a5 ) \u2212 \u03b8(\u2212x\u2212 )\u03b8(y \u2212 )V (z\u22a5 )V \u2020 (y\u22a5 ) ,(15)\nwhere G0 (p) = 1/(2p+ p\u2212 \u2212 p2\u22a5 + i\u01eb). Eq. (15) has been written in the p\u2212 \u2013representation,\nwhich is convenient given the homogeneity of the problem in time (recall that the background fields and sources are independent of x+ ; cf. eq. (3)). For the same reason, it is\npreferable to impose the strip restriction (8) on p\u2212 rather than on p+ [9] :\n\u039b\u2212 < |p\u2212 | < \u039b\u2212 /b ,\n\n(16)\n\nwhere \u039b\u2212 \u2261 Q2\u22a5 /2\u039b+ and Q\u22a5 is some generic transverse momentum8 .\n7\n\nThe discrepancy between our results below and those reported in Refs. [14, 15] may be attributed to\nusing different gauge-fixing prescriptions.\n8\nAs explained in [9], the two restrictions (8) and (16) are equivalent to leading logarithmic accuracy\nsince the relevant quantum contributions involve nearly on-shell quanta, with 2p+ p\u2212 \u2248 p2\u22a5 .\n\n6\n\n\fThe expression in eq. (15) has an intuitive interpretation [24, 9] : The particle (a\n\"semi-fast\" gluon) is moving from y to x in the presence of the singular electric field (7)\nlocated at z \u2212 = 0. In eq. (15), the end points y \u2212 to x\u2212 lie on opposite sides with respect\nto the plane z \u2212 = 0, which corresponds to trajectories crossing the potential9 . Consider\nx\u2212 > 0 and y \u2212 < 0 for definitness. On the first part of the trajectory, from y \u2212 to z \u2212 = 0,\nthe field Ai vanishes (cf. eq. (5)) and the particle moves freely. At z \u2212 = 0, the gluon\nscatters off the electric field (7) with a scattering amplitude V \u2020 (z\u22a5 ). Finally, from z \u2212 = 0\nuntil x\u2212 the color of the gluon is simply rotated, with color matrix V (x\u22a5 ), by the \"pure\ngauge\" background field Ai .\nAfter inserting eq. (15) in eq.

By using this prescription, together with the Feynman\nprescriptions in the propagators G0 (p) and G0 (k), the integrals over p+ and k + can be\neasily performed via contour technics. This generates \u03b8-functions of \u00b1x\u2212 and \u00b1p\u2212 which,\ntogether with the \u03b8-functions already present in eq. (17), have the effect to single out\ncontributions proportional to \u03b8(x\u2212 )\u03b8(\u2212p\u2212 ).\nThe final result of this straightforward calculation reads:\nh\u03b4\u03c1a (x)i = g\u03b8(x\u2212 )\n\ne\u2212ib\u039b\n\n+ x\u2212\n\n\u2212 e\u2212i\u039b\n\u03c0x\u2212\n\n+ x\u2212\n\nDxi\n\nZ\n\nd\u0393\u22a5\n\n\u0011\np\u22a5 * k \u22a5 i \u0010 a\n\u2020\nk\nTr\nT\nV\nV\n,\nz\ny\n2\ny\u22a5 =x\u22a5\np2\u22a5 k\u22a5\n\n(19)\n\nwhere the x\u2212 \u2013dependent \"form factor\" has been generated by integrating over p\u2212 within\n2\nthe strip (16) (with k\u22a5\n/2\u039b\u2212 \u2248 \u039b+ to the accuracy of interest) :\nZ\n\nstrip\n\n+ \u2212\n\n2\n\ndp\u2212 \u03b8(\u2212p\u2212 ) i 2pk\u22a5\u2212 x\u2212\n1 e\u2212ib\u039b x \u2212 e\u2212i\u039b\ne\n=\n2\n2\u03c0 2(p\u2212 )2\nk\u22a5\n2\u03c0ix\u2212\n\n+ x\u2212\n\n.\n\n(20)\n\nRemarkably, eq.

That is, the induced source is located on\n+\ntop on the tree-level source \u03c1 (with support at x\u2212 <\n\u223c 1/\u039b ). By induction, we conclude\n9\nThere are, of course, also \"non-crossing\" trajectories where x\u2212 and y \u2212 are of the same sign [9]. These\nhave not been included in eq. (15) since they do not contribute to the induced source (14).\n\n7\n\n\fthat the classical source has support only at x\u2212 \u2265 0 . When the quantum fluctuations\nare integrated out in layers of p+ , the source receives new contributions in layers of x\u2212 ,\nwith essentially no overlap between successive layers. This specific longitudinal picture\nis intimately related to our use of the retarded prescription in the LC-gauge propagator.\nWith an advanced prescription, one would rather obtain a source with support at negative\nx\u2212 . Still, the integrated (or two-dimensional) charge density \u03c3(x\u22a5 ) comes up the same\nwith both prescriptions [9, 21], and reads (cf. eq.

Note\nthat the logarithmic enhancement has been generated only after integration over x\u2212 . For\nwhat follows, it is useful to have the expression of \u03c3 rotated to the covariant gauge:\ngVab\u2020 (x\u22a5 ) \u03c3 b (x\u22a5 ) = 4 \u2202xi\n\nZ\n\nd\u0393\u22a5\n\np\u22a5 * k \u22a5 i \u0010 a \u2020 \u0011\nk Tr T Vx Vz .\n2\np2\u22a5 k\u22a5\n\n(22)\n\nIn the weak field limit g\u03b1 \u226a 1, the r.h.s. of this equation scales like g\u03c1, as it can be easily\nverified by expanding the Wilson lines; thus \u03c3 = O(\u03c1). In fact, in this limit, \u03c3 = Kvirt \u03c1,\nwith Kvirt the virtual BFKL kernel [1]. In the saturation regime, g\u03b1 \u223c 1, and all the\nnon-linear effects displayed by the above equation are equally important.\nConsider \u03c7 now.

The calculation of this and the remaining\ncontributions is similar to that of \u03c3 outlined above, and eventually gives the following\nresult (in matrix notations) [21]:\ng2\n\u2202i\u2202j\n1\nh\u03b4\u03c1x \u03b4\u03c1y i =\nFx+i hx\u22a5 |\u03b4 ij \u2212 2 |y\u22a5 iFy+j\n(24)\nln\n\u03c0\nb\n\u2207\u22a5\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013 )\n\u0012\n\u0012\ni \u0013\u0013\n\u2020j \u0013\n\u2202\n\u2202\n1\n+ \u03c1 + 2F +i D i \u2212\n.\nF +j\n|y\u22a5 i \u03c1 + 2 D \u2020j \u2212\nhx\u22a5 |\n2\n\u2212\u22072\u22a5\n2\ny\nx\n(\n\n+\nIn this equation, both \u03c1 and F +i are localized at x\u2212 <\n\u223c 1/\u039b . Thus, unlike the induced\ncharge (19), the charge-charge correlator appears to be localized near the LC (in both x\u2212\nand y \u2212 ), and thus sensitive to the internal structure of the source. If this was also true\nfor \u03c7, it would spoil the separation of scales assumed by the effective theory, and thus\nthe validity of the latter. Fortunately, however, this is not the case: Like the electric field\nF +i = \u2202 + Ai , all the other functions carrying the x\u2212 and y \u2212 dependences in eq. (24) are\ntotal derivatives with respect to x\u2212 or y \u2212 . Thus, \u03c7 - which is obtained from eq. (24) by\nintegrating over x\u2212 and y \u2212 , cf. eq. (10) - is sensitive only to the asymptotic fields.\n\nSpecifically, by using the equations of motion (1), the following identity can be verified\n(for an arbitrary function \u03a6(x\u22a5 )) :\n(\u03c1 + 2F +i D i )x \u03a6(x\u22a5 ) = i\u2202 + Dx2 \u03a6(x\u22a5 ),\n8\n\n(25)\n\n\fwhich allows us to cast \u03c7 in the following form:\n\u03c7ab (x\u22a5 , y\u22a5 ) = 4\n\n\u001a\n\nij\nAix \u03b4\u22a5\n(x\u22a5\n\n\u2212\n\ny\u22a5 )Ajy\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\n1\nj \u2020j\n|y\ni\nA\nD\n+ D A hx\u22a5 |\n\u22a5\ny\nx\n\u2212\u22072\u22a5\n\u0010\n\ni\n\ni\n\n\u0011\n\n\u001b\n\n,\n\n(26)\n\nab\n\nwhere all the fields are asymptotic fields, e.g., Aix \u2261 Ai\u221e (x\u22a5 ) and D i = \u2202 i \u2212 igAi\u221e. For\nweak fields, Ai \u2248 \u2212\u2202 i \u03b1, and \u03c7 \u2248 \u03c1 Kreal \u03c1 , with Kreal the real BFKL kernel [1]. After\nrotation to the COV-gauge (cf. eq. (11)), eq.

(11). One thus obtains (up to a tadpole which would anyway cancel against the\ntadpole ignored when writing eq.

(22), \u03b4\u03c3 has no contribution linear in \u03c1, so it does not contribute at\nthe BFKL level. This is as it should, since the BFKL equation is already obtained by\ncombining the weak field limits of the previous results for \u03c3 and \u03c7 [13]. On the other hand,\n\u03b4\u03c3 is as important as \u03c3 in the non-linear regime where g\u03b1 \u223c 1. By combining eqs. (22)\nand (28), we finally arrive at the following expression for \u03c3\u0303, which is the quantity which\nenters the RGE for W\u03c4 [\u03c1\u0303] (cf. eq. (11)) :\ng\u03c3\u0303a (x\u22a5 ) =\n\n\u2212\u22072\u22a5\n\n(\n\n2i\n\nZ\n\n\u0011\np\u22a5 * k \u22a5 \u0010\nd\u0393\u22a5 2 2 Tr T a Vx\u2020 Vz\np\u22a5 k \u22a5\n\n)\n\n\u2261 \u2212g \u22072\u22a5 \u03bda (x\u22a5 ).\n\n(29)\n\nUp to a normalization factor, the quantity \u03bda (x\u22a5 ) introduced above is the induced color\nfield in the COV-gauge, that is, the modification in the original field \u03b1 induced by the\nquantum corrections. It can be verified that \u03bd, and therefore \u03c3\u0303, are free of tadpoles: the\ntadpoles hidden in \u03c3, eq. (22), and \u2212\u03b4\u03c3, eq. (28), have cancelled in their sum.\nAt this stage, the RGE for W\u03c4 [\u03c1\u0303] is fully specified. It has the formal structure shown\nin eq. (9), but with \u03c1 \u2192 \u03c1\u0303, \u03c7 \u2192 \u03c7\u0303, and \u03c3 \u2192 \u03c3\u0303, and \u03c7\u0303 and \u03c3\u0303 given by eqs. (27) and\n(29). But the peculiar structure of the \"virtual\" correction in eq. (29) suggests that the\nRGE may acquire an even simpler form by using the COV-gauge field \u03b1 rather than the\nCOV-gauge source \u03c1\u0303 as the functional variable of W\u03c4 .

By using this relation, the RGE can be brought into a Hamiltonian form:\n\u03b1s\n\u2202W\u03c4 [\u03b1]\n=\n\u2202\u03c4\n2\n\nZ\n\n2\n\ndx\n\nZ\n\n\u03b4\nab \u03b4W\u03c4\ndy a\n\u03b7xy\n\u03b4\u03b1\u03c4 (x)\n\u03b4\u03b1\u03c4b (y)\n2\n\n!\n\n\u2261 \u2212 HW\u03c4 ,\n\n(42)\n\nwith the following, manifestly positive definite, Hamiltonian\nd2 z\u22a5 i\nJa (z\u22a5 ) Jai (z\u22a5 ),\n2\u03c0\nZ 2\ni\u03b4\nd\nx\u22a5 z i \u2212 xi\n(1 \u2212 Vz\u2020 Vx )ab b\n.\nJai (z\u22a5 ) \u2261\n2\n2\u03c0 (z\u22a5 \u2212 x\u22a5 )\n\u03b4\u03b1\u03c4 (x\u22a5 )\nH =\n\nZ\n\n(43)\n\n(Notice that the \"current\" operator Jai (z\u22a5 ) is indeed Hermitian, since the Wilson lines\nin the adjoint representation are real color matrices: Vab\u2020 = Vba .) This same Hamiltonian\nstructure has been recently identified by Weigert [20] in relation with a generating functional for Balitsky's evolution equations. Since our effective theory generates Balitsky's\nequations indeed, it should not be a surprise that we come across the same Hamiltonian.\n11\n\n\fEq. (42) has the structure of a diffusion equation. Since the Hamiltonian is a purely\nkinetic term, this equation describes a Brownian motion in the functional space of \u03b1.\nAs \u03c4 increases, we expect the solution W\u03c4 [\u03b1] to this equation to spread over the whole\navailable phase space, and thus to go asymptotically to zero at any given \"point\" \u03b1a (x\u22a5 )\n(because of the normalization condition (36)). As a simple analogy, consider the equation\ndescribing the one-dimensional diffusion:\n1 \u2202 2 W\u03c4 (x)\n\u2202W\u03c4 (x)\n= \u03b7\n.\n\u2202\u03c4\n2\n\u2202x2\n\n(44)\n\nThe solution to this equation,\nW\u03c4 (x) = \u221a\n\nx2\n1\ne\u2212 2\u03b7\u03c4 ,\n2\u03c0\u03b7\u03c4\n\n(45)\n\nis normalized to unity at any \u03c4 ( dxW\u03c4 (x) = 1), and goes smoothly to zero at any x\nwhen \u03c4 \u2192 \u221e, as it spreads over the whole x axis.\nR\n\nIn Ref. [20], Weigert has conjectured that a uniform (i.e, \u03b1-independent) probability\ndistribution W0 should be a fixed point of the evolution as \u03c4 \u2192 \u221e. His arguments are as\nfollows: first, any constant W0 is an eigenfunction of H with zero eigenvalue (HW0 = 0);\nsecond, since H is positive definite, all its other eigenvalues must be positive. From\nthis, he concludes that the constant eigenfunction (the \"fundamental state\" of H) will\nbe singled out by the evolution for sufficiently large \u03c4 . However, we disagree with this\ninterpretation. As mentioned above, a uniform probability density is necessarily trivial,\nW0 = 0, to cope with the normalization condition. Besides, for the \"fundamental state\"\nof H to be singled out by the evolution, there must be a gap between this state and the\nfirst excited state. But such a gap cannot be expected for a Hamiltonian which is just\na kinetic term, like eq. (43). To distinguish between these various asymptotic scenarios\nand, even more importantly, to find the behaviour of W\u03c4 [\u03b1] at large, but finite \u03c4 , further\nstudies of eq. (42) are necessary.\nTo conclude, we have established the equivalence between the non-linear evolution\nequations derived within perturbative QCD and within the effective theory for the Color\nGlass Condensate. We have thus resolved a discrepancy between these two approaches\npreviously reported in Refs. [14, 15]. There are several noticeable differences between our\ncalculations and those in Refs. [14, 15] (chiefly among them, the different gauge-fixing\nprescriptions), which may explain the different results, but a deep understanding of these\ndifferences requires more study. We have found that the evolution of the gluon correlation\nfunctions in the non-linear regime at small x is governed by a Hamiltonian describing\ncurrent-current interactions in two spatial dimensions. Given the relative simplicity of\nthis Hamiltonian, we believe that analytic solutions to this equation (at least in particular\nlimits) should be within our reach.\n\n12\n\n\fAcknowledgements\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge conversations with Ian Balitsky, Jean-Paul Blaizot,\nElena Ferreiro, Jamal Jalilian-Marian, Al Mueller, Eugene Levin, Yuri Kovchegov, Alex\nKovner, Raju Venugopalan, and Heribert Weigert, with special mentions to the latter\n(H.W.) for having explained to us some subtle points of his recent work.\nThis manuscript has been authorized under Contract No. DE-AC02-98H10886 with\nthe U.
