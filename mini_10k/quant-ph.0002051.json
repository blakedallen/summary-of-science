The problem is solved through a recently\ndeveloped technique and leads to the formation of a \"two-photon+atom\" bound state with fractional\npopulation trapping in both upper states.

The sensitivity of the effect to the particular form of the density of states is also explored.\n\ntwo photon emissions [12]. As we show in the following\nsections, allowing both photons to be strongly coupled\nto the PBG reservoir we obtain what should be called\n\"two-photon+atom\" bound state. The formation of such\na state is then found to be associated with a counterintuitive coherent evolution of the three atomic states.\nThe first part of our study has been based on the so-called\nisotropic model for the DOS of the PBG reservoir [13],\nwhich could be argued to effectively reduce the problem\nto one dimension in wavevector (~k)-space. A rather conspicuous feature of that DOS is a sharp (divergent) peak\nat the edge of the gap. In order to explore the persistence of our predictions under more relaxed assumptions\nfor the DOS, we have introduced a modified form represented by a generalized Lorentzian profile. It is still\nisotropic, but it does not exhibit the singularity at the\nedge. The basic features of the predicted behaviour are\nstill present with only some quantitative modifications.\nThe paper is organized as follows: Section II contains\na description of the system and a brief summary of\nthe discretization method. In section III, we derive the\nequations of motion for the amplitudes involved in the\nwavefunction of the system Atom+Continuum, which are\nsolved numerically. The dynamical behaviour of the system is thus investigated. In section IV the same problem\nis placed in the context of a generalized Lorentzian profile model for the DOS, while the results are summarized\nin section V.\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nThe emergence of materials with photonic band gaps\n(PBG) [1,2], also referred to as photonic crystals, has\nstimulated a broad range of problems pertaining to the\ninteraction of few-level atoms with unusual (structured)\nreservoirs. The unconventional photonic density of states\n(DOS) associated with such materials leads to a number\nof novel effects which pose severe demands on the theoretical tools necessary for their prediction and/or interpretation. Certain basic issues related to such problems\nare encapsulated in the behavior of excited atomic states\nwith transition frequencies around the edge of the DOS.\nEven the decay of an excited two-level atom (TLA) has\nbeen shown to exhibit novel behavior under such circumstances, the most notable aspect of which is the formation of the so-called \"photon+atom\" bound state (PABS)\n[3\u20135]. Even in the context of this simple arrangement,\nhowever, it has been difficult to handle the problem of\nmore than one photon in the PBG reservoir. An approach capable of surmounting this limitation has been\npresented recently in the context of a TLA and shown to\nprovide the solution to the problem of the coupling of a\nTLA to both a PBG reservoir and a defect mode [6].\nFor a number of reasons, three-level atoms are of particular interest in quantum optics and predictably their\nbehavior in the context of structured reservoirs has been\naddressed. This includes ladder, lambda and V-type arrangements [7\u201311]. Mathematical difficulties, however,\nhave limited the relevant investigations to the case of only\none photon present in the structured reservoir. This is\nindeed rather limiting as to the scope of questions one is\nallowed to contemplate.\nIt is our purpose in this paper to show how our approach provides a way out of this limitation. Any of\nthe above mentioned standard three-level systems can\nbe addressed. We have chosen the present results on the\nladder system which in open space involves a cascade of\n\nII. THE SYSTEM\n\nWe consider a three level atom in a cascade configuration, with atomic levels |1i, |2i, |3i and energies\nh\u0304\u03c91 , h\u0304\u03c92 , 0 respectively, where (\u03c91 > \u03c92 ) (Fig. 1a).\nBoth atomic transitions are coupled near-resonantly to\nthe edge of a photonic band gap and are thus strongly\nmodified. In the isotropic model and close to the bandedge, the dispersion relation of PBG materials, can be\n1\n\n\f\u03c9j = \u03c9e + j 2 \u03b4\u03c9,\n\napproximated by the effective mass dispersion relation\n[13,14]\n\u03c9k \u2243 \u03c9e + A(k \u2212 k0 )2 ,\n\nwhere \u03b4\u03c9 is chosen sufficiently small (\u03b4\u03c9 \u2248 4.4 \u00d7\n2/3\n10\u22124 C1 ). The coupling G (1) of the upper transition to\neach one of the discrete modes is found using Eq. (4)\nr\n2C 1 \u221a\n(1)\n\u03c9u \u2212 \u03c9e ,\n(7)\nG \u2248\nN\u03c0\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03c9e , k0 are the frequency and the wavenumber corresponding to the band-edge and A is a material specific\nconstant. The corresponding density of states (DOS)\nreads\n\u03c1(\u03c9) = \u221a\n\n\u03c1o\n\u0398(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9e ),\n\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9e\n\nwhere N is the number of discrete modes and \u03c9u is the\nupper limit of the discretized part. A similar relation can\nbe derived for the coupling G (2) of the lower transition,\nwhere now C2 will be the corresponding effective coupling. In general, the dipole moments h1|d|2i and h2|d|3i\nare different and thus for the rest of this paper we let the\ncouplings C1 and C2 be different.\nLet us denote by |3, 1j , 1m i, a state of the combined system (atom+field), where the atom is in state |3i and two\nphotons have been emitted into the structured reservoir,\npopulating the modes j and m respectively. Following\nthis pattern of notation, the wavefunction of the complete system reads\nX\nX\n|\u03a8(t)i = a|1, 0, 0i +\nbj |2, 1j , 0i +\nCjm |3, 1j , 1m i. (8)\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03c1o is a material specific constant and \u0398(x) the\nHeaviside step-function.\nNeglecting the zero-point energies of the field modes and\nadopting the rotating wave approximation, the Hamiltonian of the system in the interaction picture (h\u0304 = 1) is\nwritten as\nX\n1\n1\nV =i\ng\u03bc(1) (a\u2020\u03bc \u03c321 e\u2212i\u03b4\u03bc t \u2212 a\u03bc \u03c312 ei\u03b4\u03bc t )\n\u03bc\n\n+i\n\nX\n\u03bb\n\n(2)\n\n2\n\n2\n\ng\u03bb (a\u2020\u03bb \u03c332 e\u2212i\u03b4\u03bb t \u2212 a\u03bb \u03c323 ei\u03b4\u03bb t ),\n\n(3)\n\nj\n\nwhere \u03c3kl denote the atomic dyadic operators |kihl| with\nk, l\u01eb{1, 2, 3}; \u03b4\u03bc1 = (\u03c91 \u2212 \u03c92 ) \u2212 \u03c9\u03bc , \u03b4\u03bb2 = (\u03c92 \u2212 \u03c93 ) \u2212 \u03c9\u03bb ,\nwhile a\u03bc , a\u2020\u03bc (a\u03bb , a\u2020\u03bb ) are the creation and annihilation operators of the structured continuum, which is coupled to\nthe atomic transitions, via the respective coupling con(1) (2)\nstants g\u03bc , g\u03bb .\nThe spectral response SR(\u03c9\u03bc ) corresponding to the PBG\neffective mass dispersion relation Eq.

EQUATIONS OF MOTION AND RESULTS\n\nThe time dependence of the amplitudes, is governed\nby the Schr\u00f6dinger equation and after eliminating the\noff-resonant modes [6], we find\n\nC1 \u0398(\u03c9\u03bc \u2212 \u03c9e )\n,\n\u221a\n\u03c0\n\u03c9\u03bc \u2212 \u03c9e\n\n(1)\n\n\u0227 = \u2212i\n\n(4)\n\nX\n\n\u03c9\u03bc >\u03c9u\n\ng\u03bc\n\nb \u0307j = \u2212i\n\nwhere the sum is over the polarizations, the integral runs\nover the solid angle and C1 is the effective coupling of the\nupper transition to the structured continuum [7].\nIn order to deal with the double excitation into the structured reservoir, we use the discretization method that we\nhave presented recently [6]. Briefly, we replace the density of modes in Eq. (2) near the atomic transitions (for\n\u03c9 < \u03c9u ) by a collection of discrete harmonic oscillators,\nwhile the rest of the mode-density is treated perturbatively since it is far from resonance. We propagate the\ntotal wavefunction (Atom+Modes) to obtain the dynamics of the system.\nFor an arbitrary DOS, the frequencies of the discrete\nmodes, are obtained through the relation\n\nX\n\n\u03c9\u03bb >\u03c9u\n\n2\n\na\u2212\n\n\u03b4\u03bc1\n(2)\n\n\u03c9j+1 = \u03c9j\u22121 + 2/\u03c1(\u03c9j ),\n\n(6)\n\ng\u03bb\n\n\u03b4\u03bb2\n\n2\n\nN\nX\nj=1\n\nbj \u2212\n\n(1)\n\nN\nX\n\nm=1\n\n(2)\n\n \u0307 = G (2) bj e\nCjm\n+ Gj bm e\nm\n\u221a (2) \u2212i\u03b42 t\nC \u0307jj = 2Gj bj e j ,\n\n(9)\n\n2\n\n(2)\nGm\nCjm ei\u03b4m t\n\n\u221a (2)\n1\n2\n(1)\n\u2212 2Gj Cjj ei\u03b4j t + Gj ae\u2212i\u03b4j t ,\n2\n\u2212i\u03b4m\nt\n\n1\n\nGj bj ei\u03b4j t ,\n\n\u2212i\u03b4j2 t\n\n,\n\n(10)\n(11)\n(12)\n\nwhere j, m are mode indices and for all discrete modes\n(2)\n(1)\n(2)\n(1)\nG (1) = Gj = Gm and G (2) = Gj = Gm , while the\nshift terms can be determined, converting the sum into\nan integral from \u03c9 = \u03c9u to infinity.\nThis set of equations is solved numerically for 150 dis2/3\ncrete modes (\u03c9u \u2248 10C1 ), with the results presented\nin Figs. 2-6. We plot the population in the upper level\n(solid line), the intermediate level (dashed line) and the\nlower level (dot-dashed line), for various detunings of the\ntransition frequencies from the band-edge. We define the\nrelative detunings of the upper and lower transitions from\n\n(5)\n\nwhich for the case of the DOS of Eq. (2) can be reduced\nto\n2\n\n\fthe band-edge as \u03b412 = \u03c91 \u2212\u03c92 \u2212\u03c9e and \u03b423 = \u03c92 \u2212\u03c93 \u2212\u03c9e ,\nrespectively.\nIn all figures, we can identify a \"transient regime\", on a\n2/3\nshort time scale of the order of C1 , when part of the\natomic population is lost. On a longer time scale (\"dynamic regime\"), the populations in the atomic levels undergo oscillations, strongly dependent on the relative detunings from the band-edge, reflecting the emission and\nreabsorption of the photon(s). The localization at the\natom of the photon emitted in the first transition, is accompanied by emission of a photon in the lower transition, which will be also localized at the atom. In analogy\nwith the case of one photon in a TLA, two photons are\nnow backscattered to the atom after tunneling a characteristic distance and reexcite it.\nAs is known from the coupling of a TLA to the PBG\nreservoir, the dressing of the atom by its own radiation\ncauses splitting of the atomic levels. This splitting is sufficiently strong to push one level of the doublets outside\nthe gap and the other inside. The dressed state outside\nthe gap looses all its population in the long-time limit,\nwhile the one inside the gap is protected from dissipation\nand thus is stable. The number of stable localized states,\nis intimately connected to the behavior of the system in\nthe long-time limit. One such state gives rise to steady\nstate population in the excited level, while two of them\nlead to an undamped beating of the system between the\ntwo non-decaying states [4,5].\nFor our three-level atom, two transitions are at the\nedge, and thus more than one stable localized state\ncan be found in the gap. In analogy to the \"singlephoton+atom\" bound state, we have the formation of\na \"two-photon+atom\" bound state, which exhibits population trapping in both excited states, in the long-time\nlimit. Thus, the atom is finally excited, in a superposition\nof the upper states (Fig. 2). This is a novel behavior, due\nto the fact that both transitions and not only one, are\ncoupled to the same structured continuum. Note that,\neven in the case that only the (|2i \u2192 |3i) transition is\nat the edge of the gap, it is the intermediate level that\nexhibits non-zero steady-state population but not the upper level [3,7].\nIn the language of dressed states, the oscillations in the\npopulations of the atomic levels reflect the interference\nbetween the dressed states of the atom. We additionally note that the oscillations in the populations of the\nintermediate and lower level are \"in phase\". This is a\nrather surprising result, since one would expect the population in the intermediate state to be maximum when\nthe population in the lower state is minimum and viseversa. The phenomenon is even more pronounced in Figs.\n3. After an initial transient regime in which about 15%\nof the population is lost, the remaining population oscillates between the upper level and the two lower levels, in\na non-dissipative way. The undamped oscillations imply\n\nthe beating of the system, between more than two nondecaying dressed states.\nThe \"in phase\" oscillations, stem from the localization\nof both photons at the site of the atom. The system\ncan make the transitions |1i \u2194 |3i either with a stepwise\nprocess (|1i \u2194 |2i \u2194 |3i) or with a two-photon process\n(|1i \u2194 |3i). Which of the two routes the system will follow to arrive at |3i depends on the detuning \u03b412 .\nSpecifically, if the upper transition is outside the gap,\nwhatever the detuning from the edge of the lower transition is, it seems preferable for the system to \"decay\" via\nthe stepwise process rather than the two-photon process\nindicated in Fig.4. This is no different from the behaviour\nof a ladder system in open space. On the contrary, if the\nupper transition is inside the gap, the system evolves in\ntime as if the upper state were coupled to the intermediate state via a single-photon process, and simultaneously\nto the ground state via a \"direct\" two-photon process,\nwith respective frequencies \u03a91 and \u03a92 . This can not be\nanticipated on the basis of the behaviour in open space\nand it is what we meant by counter-intuitive in the introduction.\nTo gain further insight into this effect, we can adopt\na simple 3-level model without dissipation and assign\na single-photon Rabi frequency \u03a91 between |1i and |2i\nand a two-photon Rabi frequency \u03a92 between |1i and |3i\n(Fig. 1b). An analysis through standard rate equations\nshows that the populations of p\nthe atomic levels oscillate\nwith the same frequency \u03a9 = \u03a921 + \u03a922 , with the oscillation of the two lower levels being in phase. The ratio\nof the amplitude of the oscillation of the intermediate\nlevel to that of the lower level is related to the ratio of\nthe Rabi frequencies, i.e. \u03a91 /\u03a92 . In Fig. 3b representing the result of the numerical calculation for the system\nin the PBG reservoir, we note that the dashed and the\ndot-dashed lines, corresponding to the populations in the\nintermediate and ground levels, respectively, are indistinguishable. This implies that the corresponding effective\nRabi frequencies \u03a91 and \u03a92 are practically equal. It is\nthe combination of the coupling constants and detunings\nthat conspire to produce that behaviour.\nThe effective detuning of the |3i \u2194 |1i transitions from\nthe band-edge for the \"direct\" two-photon process is defined as \u2206(2) = \u03c91 \u2212 \u03c93 \u2212 2\u03c9e . From the known dynamics\nof a TLA with transition frequency at the edge of the gap,\ndepending on \u2206(2) , we may expect suppression or inhibition of the \"direct\" two-photon process. Specifically,\nfor detunings inside the gap (\u2206(2) < 0), the \"direct\"\ntwo-photon emission should be totally or partially suppressed, while for detunings outside the gap and almost\nat the edge (\u2206(2) > 0), it should be enhanced due to the\nhigh density of final available states.\nFor transitions symmetrically placed around the bandedge (\u03b412 = \u2212\u03b423 ), with the upper one being inside the\ngap (\u03b412 < 0), the detuning for the \"direct\" two-photon\ntransition is exactly at the edge (\u2206(2) = 0) (Fig. 5).\n3\n\n\fFor the parameters used in Figs. 5 and without taking into account the \"direct\" two-photon process, the\n\"single-photon+atom\" bound state for the upper state\nshould be metastable, in the sense that the main part of\nthe population should be lost in the long-time limit. On\nthe contrary, we find that this does not happen and the\npart of the population that has not been lost in the transient regime, oscillates between the upper and the ground\nstate. These oscillations are not reflected in the intermediate level's population which remains almost constant\nwith some oscillations of negligible amplitude. This behavior definitely indicates the coupling of the upper level\nto the ground level via a \"direct\" two-photon process as\ndescribed above. Note again the \"in phase\" oscillations\nfor the two lower levels.\nChoosing \u03b423 such that \u2206(2) > 0 (Fig. 6), the main\npart of the population is indeed lost in the long-time\nlimit. The difference between Fig. 5a and Fig. 6 is\nthe detuning of the lower transition from the band-edge.\n2/3\n2/3\nIn both cases (\u03b423 = 2C2 , \u03b423 = 4C2 ), the behavior of a TLA in the long-time limit is the same i.e. the\npopulation is lost. For the Ladder system, however, we\nnote an oscillatory behavior where part of the population is trapped to the atom in the long-time limit for\n2/3\n2/3\n\u03b423 = 2C2 and complete decay for \u03b423 = 4C2 . The\nphoton-atom bound state formed due to the upper transition becomes therefore metastable [3,7] as soon as \u03b423 is\nchosen such that \u2206(2) > 0. This is a conclusion that has\nbeen checked for various detunings of the atomic transitions from the band-edge but with the upper one always\nin the gap (\u03b412 \u2264 0).\n\nof higher order given by the expression\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0393n\n.\n\u03c1(\u03c9) = \u03c10 1 \u2212\n(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9o )n + \u0393n\n\n(13)\n\nFirst of all, this DOS approaches the open space value\n\u03c10 for |\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9o | >> \u0393. Second, it does not exhibit a divergence at the edge. In fact, the \"edge\" is not infinitely\nsteep, but does rise more steeply, as n \u2192 \u221e.\nIt could be argued that this DOS does not exhibit a clear\nedge and possesses a zero only at one point. It should be\nkept in mind on the other hand that, in a realistic PBG\nmaterial, the gap does not necessarily mean a true zero\nbut a range of frequencies over which the DOS is several\norders of magnitude smaller than that of open space [15].\nTaking n sufficiently large, in Eq. (13), one can obtain a\nrange of frequencies over which \u03c1(\u03c9)/\u03c10 is smaller than\na desired value. For n = 6, for example, \u03c1(\u03c9)/\u03c10 \u2264 10\u22126\nfor \u03c9 = \u03c9o \u00b1 0.1\u0393. One can further combine the inverted\nLorentzian with step functions in order to simulate a true\nzero over a range of \u03c9, if so desired. The shape of the\nDOS given by Eq. (13), can be viewed as a compromise\nbetween the isotropic and the anisotropic models [13],\nand has been used in the literature for n = 2 [14,16,17].\nIt should be stressed once more that the modified DOS\nin no way relaxes its isotropic in ~k space nature. It only\neliminates the singularity.\nWe proceed now to the exploration of the ladder system\nunder the DOS of Eq. (13) adopting the specific case\nof n = 6. It is one of the strengths of the technique\nof discretization that it can be implemented with essentially any DOS, provided the manner of discretization is\nadapted to the demands of the particular form. For the\ncase under consideration, which is symmetric around \u03c9o ,\nwe chose a range \u03c9low < \u03c9 < \u03c9up within which the DOS\nis replaced by a sufficiently large number (in this case\n150) equidistant discrete modes. The spectral response\ncorresponding to Eq. (13) for n = 6 is of the form\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u03936\n\u03b31\n(1)\n1\u2212\n,\n(14)\nSR (\u03c9\u03bc ) =\n2\u03c0\n(\u03c9\u03bc \u2212 \u03c9o )6 + \u03936\n\nIV. GAP WITH A LORENTZIAN PROFILE OF\nDOS\n\nThe isotropic model for the DOS of a photonic crystal has been employed quite extensively in the literature.\nThat is the model we have employed in the previous sections in order to have a direct assessment of the new\nresults vis a vis those obtained in previous work with\nonly one photon in the reservoir, where the same DOS\nhas been assumed. It is, however, well known that this\nDOS is somewhat artificial, with a divergence as the frequency approaches the band edge. The infinitely high\nsharp peak at the edge tends to exaggerate many effects\nand it is important to check predictions made on the basis of this model against other forms of DOS. With this\nintention, we introduce here a DOS which although still\nisotropic, does not exhibit a divergence at the edge.\nWhat is essential for an appropriate model of the DOS is\nthat it exhibit a dip and also that it tend to the open\nspace DOS as the frequency becomes much larger or\nsmaller than the mid-gap frequency. We have chosen to\nadopt as a model of such a DOS an inverted Lorentzian\n\nwhere \u03b31 is the decay rate of the upper state in free space.\nThe coupling of the upper transition to the ith discrete\nmode is frequency dependent and is given by\nr s\u0014\n\u0015\n\u03936\n\u03b31\n(1)\n1\u2212\nG (\u03c9i ) =\n\u2206\u03c9,\n(15)\n2\u03c0\n(\u03c9i \u2212 \u03c9o )6 + \u03936\nwhere \u2206\u03c9 \u2248 0.27\u03b32 is the spacing between two discrete\nmodes and \u03c9i is the frequency corresponding to the ith\nmode. An analogous relation gives the coupling of the\nlower transition, G (2) , to the ith mode, where \u03b31 is replaced by \u03b32 , the free space decay-rate of the intermediate state. By way of comparison illustrating the philosophy of the discretization procedure, note that here\nthe mode-spacing is uniform but the coupling constant\n4\n\n\ffrequency-dependent; while in section II (Eqs. 5 and 7)\nit is the other way around.\nThe rest of the mode-density, for \u03c9 > \u03c9up and \u03c9 < \u03c9low ,\nis treated perturbatively [6] leading to a shift for the\ntwo upper levels. These shift terms differ from those\nin Eqs. (9-12) and are not given explicitly. They can,\nhowever, be determined numerically. The relative positions of the upper and lower transition frequencies are\nnow defined with respect to the central frequency \u03c9o of\nthe gap, in terms of the detunings: \u03b412 = \u03c91 \u2212 \u03c92 \u2212 \u03c9o\nand \u03b423 = \u03c92 \u2212 \u03c93 \u2212 \u03c9o , respectively. In Fig. 7, we\npresent the evolution of the population in the states of\nthe Ladder system as a function of time, for a particular\ncombination of detunings. As in the previous figures corresponding to the isotropic model, both upper and lower\nlevels exhibit non-zero steady-state population, as a consequence of the \"two-photon+atom\" bound state. The\noscillations, however, in the atomic populations, which\ncan be interpreted as interference between the dressed\nstates, are not present. It seems that this oscillatory behavior is strongly related to the isotropic model. For the\nLorentzian profile, the part of the doublet that is pushed\noutside the gap, decays much faster than the isotropic\nmodel would predict. From this we conclude that in the\nisotropic model, the \"dynamic regime\" which follows the\ninitial transient regime and is dominated by the emission and reabsorption of photons, or else the interference\nbetween the various dressed states, is much more pronounced than in the Lorentzian model, or we would argue any model that does not exhibit the highly peaked\nfeature of the isotropic model [18]. Without the concentration of the density of states around a peak, the notion\nof dressed states is diluted. Nevertheless, the coherent superposition of states and the \"two-photon+atom\" bound\nstate persists even in this model. Atomic populations remain trapped for long times, long compared to 1/\u03b32 .\nA further issue needs to be brought up here, in connection with the time scale of the persistence of any \"photon+atom\" bound state. As long as the model for the\nDOS involves an exact zero over some frequency range,\nthe \"photon+atom\" bound state lives for ever, which\nmathematically implies a non-zero fractional population\ntrapping in the limit t \u2192 \u221e. In reality, however, the\nDOS, more often than not, will not involve an exact zero\nbut a deep minimum, as already mentioned in the beginning of this section. As a result, the life-time of the\n\"photon+atom\" bound state, will be long on some time\nscale but not necessarily for t \u2192 \u221e in the mathematical\nsense. It is this finiteness of the lifetime of the \"twophoton+atom\" bound state that would cause the populations of states |1i and |2i in Fig.7 to decay to zero, if the\ncalculation were extended to sufficiently long times. The\nessential point therefore is that the population may remain trapped for such a long time which, for all practical\npurposes, is equivalent to t \u2192 \u221e.\n\nV. SUMMARY\n\nWe have investigated the dynamics of a Ladder atomic\nsystem with both transitions coupled to the same structured reservoir. This has been possible through a discretization approach according to which the density of\nmodes over a range near the atomic transitions is replaced by an appropriately chosen collection of discrete\nharmonic oscillators, with the rest of the mode-density\ntreated perturbatively. We have found that this system\nsupports a \"two-photon+atom\" bound state which leads\nto a fractional population trapping in both of the upper\nstates and the atom can be in a superposition of the upper levels even in the long-time limit. In the presence of\nthe two photons at the site of the atom, we have shown\nthat the atom has two paths for the |1i \u2194 |3i transition,\nand found that a \"direct\" two-photon process coexists\nwith a stepwise one. Which of the two dominates is determined mainly by the detuning of the upper transition\nfrom the band-edge. We have further explored the persistence of this effect under much more relaxed forms of the\nDOS and shown that, although quantitatively modified,\nthe basic effect remains.\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n\n[13]\n[14]\n\n[15]\n\n5\n\nE.
