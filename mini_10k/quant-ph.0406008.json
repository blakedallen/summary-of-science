Furthermore, the required number\nof ancilla photons is the least of all current parity filter proposals. Remarkably, the\nquantum filter operates with probability 12 even in the N -photon case, irregardless of\nthe number of photons in the input state.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nRecently, much effort has been made to find efficient schemes for the realisation of non-linear\noperations between photons, thereby aiming at minimising the required resources and increasing success probabilities. This is motivated by the fact that for many practical purposes,\nthe polarisation states of photons provide the most favoured qubits since they possess very\nlong lifetimes and an ease in distribution. Potential applications include quantum information processing [1, 2] as well as quantum cryptography [3, 4]. However, it is difficult to create\nan effective interaction between photons. Hence linear optics quantum computing requires\nthe presence of auxiliary photon states and postselective measurements which implies, in\ngeneral, finite success rates of gate operations [5].\nAn effectively nonlinear operation, whose implementation has widely been discussed in\nthe literature, is the parity or quantum filter [6, 7, 8]. The application of parity filters\nis diverse, ranging from quantum non demolition measurements of entanglement to the\ngeneration of multiphoton quantum codes [6] and the generation of multipartite entanglement\n[8]. Moreover, it has been shown that the parity filter can constitute a crucial component\n1\n\n\ffor the generation of Cluster states for one-way quantum computing [9, 10]. Together with\nsingle qubit rotations and measurements, the parity filter constitutes a universal set of gate\noperations [10].\nApplied to two photons, the parity filter projects their state onto a 2-dimensional subspace\nin which a measurement of the linear polarisation (horizontal or vertical) would give the same\nresult for each photon. We denote the corresponding filter operator as P2 and define\n\u0011\n\u221a \u0010\nP2 = p2 |HHihHH| + |V V ihV V | ,\n(1)\nwhere H and V describe a horizontally and a vertically polarised photon, respectively. Besides, p2 is the success probability for the performance of the parity projection on an arbitrary\ninput state. This means, even when applied to a parity eigenstate, the photons only pass\nthrough the filter with probability p2 . In this paper, the term success probability denotes the\nprojection efficiency of a given setup.\nIn the original proposal of a linear optics implementation of the parity filter [6], Hofmann\n1\nand Takeuchi obtained a success probability of p2 = 16\nafter passing the photons through\nseveral beam splitters and performing postselective measurements. Two other proposals\nyield a higher success probability of p2 = 41 [7, 8]. Grudka and Wojcik achieve this by using\nthe idea of teleportation [2] and by employing ancilla states containing six photons [7]. Zou\nand Pahlke use a single mode quantum filter that separates the 1-photon state from the\nvacuum and the 2-photon state. By combining two such single mode filters, a parity filter\ncan be realised that requires a 4-photon ancilla state as a resource [8].\nIn direct analogy to the 2-photon parity filter (1), a quantum filter for N photons can be\ndefined by the operator\n\u0011\n\u221a \u0010\nPN = pN |HH . . . HihHH . . . H| + |V V . . . V ihV V . . . V | .\n(2)\nApplied to an arbitrary input state with N photons, this filter projects the system with\nprobability pN onto the 2-dimensional subspace where all photons have the same polarisation\nin the |Hi and |V i basis. One way to implement this gate is to pass the input state through\n(N \u2212 1) 2-photon parity filters, which succeeds with overall probability pN = p2N \u22121 . This\napproach presents a steep challenge for large particle numbers, given the above mentioned\nsuccess probabilities of a single 2-photon parity check.\nIn the following, we describe a potential implementation of the N-photon quantum filter\n(2) with a success rate as high as pN = 21 , which is much more effective than performing\noperation (2) with the previously proposed 2-photon parity filters. As a resource we require\nthe presence of the N-photon GHZ-state\n|A(N ) i =\n\n\u221a1\n2\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n|HH . . . Hi + |V V . . . V i .\n\n(3)\n\nIn principle, this photon state can be prepared on demand [11, 12, 13]. Furthermore, we\nrequire a photon-number resolving detector that can distinguish between 0, 1 and 2 photons.\nTo implement the quantum filter (2) we use ideas that have been inspired by a recently\nperformed entanglement purification protocol [14] as well as by a scheme for the realisation\nof quantum logic operations between photonic qubits [15].\n2\n\n\f2\n\nA multipartite quantum filter\n\nThe most important component of our scheme is the polarising beam splitter, which redirects\na photon depending on its polarisation to one of the output modes. In the following, |\u03bbi i\ndescribes a photon with polarisation \u03bb travelling in mode i. Besides, we denote the input\nmodes i = 1 and 2 and the output modes i = 1\u2032 and 2\u2032 such that a V polarised photon\nentering input mode 1 and an H polarised photon entering input mode 2 leave the setup\nthrough output 1\u2032 . Suppose, two photons enter the setup in different modes. Then the effect\nof the beam splitter can then be summarised in the transformation\n\n|\u03bb1 \u03bc2 i \u2297 |01\u2032 02\u2032 i \u2212\u2192\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\n|01 02 i \u2297 |H1\u2032 H2\u2032 i ,\n|01 02 i \u2297 |V1\u2032 V2\u2032 i ,\n|01 02 i \u2297 |(HV )1\u2032 02\u2032 i ,\n|01 02 i \u2297 |01\u2032 (HV )2\u2032 i ,\n\nif\nif\nif\nif\n\n\u03bb=\u03bc=H ,\n\u03bb=\u03bc=V ,\n\u03bb = V and \u03bc = H ,\n\u03bb = H and \u03bc = V .\n\n(4)\n\nWe show now that this operation can be used to realise a filter which compares the polarisation \u03bb of a target photon with the polarisation of an ancilla photon prepared in |\u03bc2 i. With\n\u03bc being either V or H, the filter operation corresponds to the projector |\u03bcih\u03bc| and can be\nimplemented with unit efficiency.\nSuppose a photon number resolving detector is placed in one of the output modes, say\noutput 2\u2032 , and the target photon enters the system prepared in |\u03bb1 i = \u03b1 |H1 i + \u03b2 |V1 i. Then\nthe target photon is found to have polarisation \u03bc in case of a single click in the detector\nindicating a 1-photon measurement. Using Eq. (4), one can calculate the corresponding\nunnormalised output state. It is either \u03b1 |H1\u2032 i or \u03b2 |V1\u2032 i, depending on whether \u03bc equals\nH or V . Note that the probability for a 1-photon detection (|\u03b1|2 or |\u03b2|2 , respectively) is\nexactly what one would expect after applying the filter operation |\u03bcih\u03bc| with efficiency 1\nto the incoming photon. Remarkably, the target photon is effectively not destroyed in the\nprocess. The reason is that it does not matter whether the detector absorbs the target photon\nor the ancilla photon, if both have the same polarisation and are anyway indistinguishable.\n\n2.1\n\nThe 2-photon case\n\nLet us now describe how the polarising beam splitter (4) can be used for the implementation\nof a 2-photon parity filter. The setup we consider here contains two polarising beam splitters\nand two polarisation sensitive detectors (see Figure 1). The target state enters the setup\nvia the input modes 1 and 3. We further require the presence of the 2-photon ancilla state\n|A(2) i, which is a 2-photon Bell state. The ancilla photons should enter the setup via the\ninput modes 2 and 4. The two detectors are placed in the output modes 2\u2032 and 4\u2032 . In case\nthe two photons are found in a parity eigenstate, they leave the setup via the output modes\n1\u2032 and 3\u2032 .\nIn the following, we consider the general input state\n(2)\n\n|\u03c8in i = \u03b1 |H1 H3 i + \u03b2 |V1 V3 i + \u03b3 |H1 V3 i + \u03b4 |V1 H3 i .\n3\n\n(5)\n\n\fFigure 1: Experimental setup for the realisation of a 2-photon parity filter. The target photons\nenter the setup via the input modes 1 and 3, while the ancilla photons enter the setup via inputs 2\nand 4. Within the setup, each photon has to pass one polarising beam splitter. Under the condition\nof the detection of one photon in each of the outputs 2\u2032 and 4\u2032 , the filter succeeded and the projected\noutput state leaves the system via the modes 1\u2032 and 3\u2032 .\nOur aim is to eliminate the components, where the photons are of different polarisation.\nTogether with the ancilla state |A(2) i, the setup in Figure 1 is entered by the 4-photon state\n(2)\n\n(2)\n\n|\u03c8\u0303in i = |\u03c8in i \u2297 |A(2) i\n=\n\n\u221a1\n2\n\n\u0010\n\n\u03b1 |H1 H2 H3 H4 i + \u03b1 |H1 V2 H3 V4 i + \u03b2 |V1V2 V3 V4 i + \u03b2 |V1 H2 V3 H4 i\n\u0011\n\n+\u03b3 |H1 H2 V3 H4 i + \u03b3 |H1 V2 V3 V4 i + \u03b4 |V1 V2 H3 V4 i + \u03b4 |V1 H2 H3 H4 i .\n\n(6)\n\nWe now show that the system can act like a parity filter, if one photon is collected in output\nmode 2\u2032 and another one is collected in output mode 4\u2032 .

The N\npolarising beam splitters each compare the state of one of the target photons with the state of one\nof the ancilla photons, which are initially prepared in the GHZ state |A(N ) i. Besides, N detectors\nperform photon measurements in the polarisation basis (8). The output photons leave the system\nvia the odd numbered output ports.\n\nThe \"+\" sign applies when both detectors measure the same polarisation (which happens\nwith probability 21 ); the \"\u2212\" sign applies when both detectors measure different polarisations\n(which also happens with probability 12 ). The implementation of the parity filter now requires\nonly one further operation, namely the correction of the sign of the state |V1\u2032 V3\u2032 i in case of\na sign error. This can be implemented with the help of a Pauli \u03c3z operation on one of the\nphotons and yields the final state\n(2)\n\n|\u03c8out i =\n\n\u221a1\n2\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u03b1 |H1\u2032 H3\u2032 i + \u03b2 |V1\u2032 V3\u2032 i .\n\n(11)\n\nA closer look at the normalisation of this state tells us that the parity filter shown in Figure\n1 works with efficiency p2 = 12 . If the success probability of the scheme would be 1, the\noutput state (11) would be \u03b1 |H1\u2032 H3\u2032 i + \u03b2 |V1\u2032 V3\u2032 i. It can be shown that the filter can also\nbe operated with mixed states as inputs.\n\n2.2\n\nThe N -photon case\n\nThe generalisation of the above described 2-photon parity filter to the N-photon quantum\nfilter (4) is straightforward and requires N polarising beam splitters and N polarisation\nsensitive detectors (see Figure 2). One side of the setup is entered by the N-photon input\n(N )\nstate |\u03c8in i with one photon in each odd-numbered input mode, while the other side is\nentered by an N-photon ancilla state |A(N ) i with one photon in each even numbered input\nmode. In the following we denote the modes containing the detectors by 2\u2032 , 4\u2032 , ..., (2N)\u2032 ,\nwhile the modes 1\u2032 , 3\u2032 , ..., (2N \u2212 1)\u2032 contain the output state.\n5\n\n\fAgain, the successful operation of the quantum filter is indicated by a single click in each\nof the detectors. Suppose \u03b1 denotes the amplitude of the state |H1 H3 . . . H2N \u22121 i while \u03b2 is\n(N )\nthe amplitude of the state |V1 V3 . . . V2N \u22121i with respect to the target state |\u03c8in i. Then we\nfind, using Eq. (4) and in analogy to Eq. (7), that the collection of one photon in each of\n(N )\n(N )\nthe detector output ports transforms the total input state |\u03c8\u0303in i = |\u03c8in i \u2297 |A(N ) i into\n(N )\n\n|\u03c8\u0303out i =\n\n\u221a1\n2\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u03b1 |H1\u2032 H2\u2032 . . . H(2N )\u2032 i + \u03b2 |V1\u2032 V2\u2032 . . . V(2N )\u2032 i .\n\n(12)\n\nFor the same reason as in the 2-photon case, we assume that the detectors measure the\npolarisation of the incoming photons in the polarisation basis (8) by absorption. Suppose\nJ is the number of photons found in the |\u2212i state, then one can show using Eq. (12) and\nproceeding as in Section 2.1 that the output state of the remaining N photons equals\n(N )\n\n|\u03c8out i =\n\n\u221a1\n2\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u03b1 |H1\u2032 H3\u2032 . . . H(2N \u22121)\u2032 i + (\u22121)J \u03b2 |V1\u2032 V3\u2032 . . . V(2N \u22121)\u2032 i .\n\n(13)\n\nDepending on whether J is even or odd, the implementation of the quantum filter (2) might\nfurther require a conditional sign flip on one of the photons, which then yields the final state\n(N )\n\n|\u03c8out i =\n\n\u221a1\n2\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u03b1 |H1\u2032 H3\u2032 ...H(2N \u22121)\u2032 i + \u03b2 |V1\u2032 V3\u2032 ...V(2N \u22121)\u2032 i .\n\n(14)\n\nThis is exactly the output state that one expects after the application of the quantum filter\n(N )\n(2) to the input state |\u03c8in i with success probability pN = 12 , which is the highest that\nhas been predicted so far without the use of universal two-qubit quantum gate operations.1\nNaively, one might expect that the efficiency of the filter decreases with the number of\nphotons in the setup but this is not the case. Only the number of photons, which form the\nancilla state (3), depends on N. Furthermore, we remark that the described quantum filter\nalso works for mixed N-photon input states.\n\n2.3\n\nThe effect of imperfect photon sources and detectors\n\nFinally, we briefly discuss the effect of potential imperfections of the experimental setup\non the performance of the proposed quantum filter operation. The main source for errors,\nwhich diminishes both, the success probability and fidelity of the filter output, are the use\nof imperfect ancilla states (3) and the use of photon detectors with finite detector efficiency.\nSince the setup shown in Figure 2 is relatively simple, errors arising from faulty alignments of\noptical elements can be minimised easily. Note that for the scheme to work, it is important\nthat each target photon and the corresponding ancilla photon overlap within their coherence\ntime within the polarising beam splitter.\n1\n\nA straightforward way of implementing the quantum filter (2) with universal two-qubit quantum gate\noperations (which are difficult to realise with linear optics alone) is to replace each polarising beam splitter in\nthe setup (see Figure 2) by a controlled-NOT gate. Furthermore the detectors in all even numbered output\nmodes should perform a polarisation sensitive measurement in the H/V basis. The projection efficiency of\nsuch a scheme would only be limited by the success probability p of a single controlled-NOT operation and\nwould scale like pN . For sufficiently large photon numbers N , this might decrease below 12 . Therefore the\nuse of polarising beam splitters, which can operate with a very high fidelity, should be favoured [14].\n\n6\n\n\fSuppose the ancilla photons do not enter the setup in the GHZ state (3) and their state\npossesses a small component with amplitude \u01eb of a state in which the photons are not all of\nthe same polarisation, say |H2 V4 V6 ...V2N i. In this case, the component \u03b3 |H1 V3 V5 ...V(2N \u22121) i of\nthe photon target state also contributes to the case of the detection of one photon per output\nport. Proceeding as in Section 2.2, one can calculate the state, in which the photons leave\nthe setup in this case. Doing so we find that the fidelity of the filtered output state decreases,\nin first order in |\u01eb|2 , from being one to 1 \u2212 |\u01eb\u03b3|2 /(|\u03b1|2 + |\u03b2|2 ). Moreover, the probability for\nthe photons to pass the filter now differs by the amount |\u01eb|2 (|\u03b3|2 \u2212 12 |\u03b1|2 \u2212 21 |\u03b2|2) from the\ndesired probability 21 (|\u03b1|2 + |\u03b2|2). However, these deviations from the ideal quantum filter\nare negligible as long as |\u01eb|2 \u226a 1. We believe that preparation of the ancilla states considered\nin this paper with a high fidelity and success rate (i.e. with |\u01eb|2 \u226a 1) will be feasible in the\nnearer future [11, 12, 13].\nLet us now consider a setup, where the photon detector efficiency is not given by \u03b7 = 1\nbut by \u03b7 < 1. Moreover, let us assume a perfectly prepared ancilla state and a photon target\n(N )\nstate of the special form |\u03c8in i = \u03b1 |H1 H3 ...H(2N \u22121) i + \u03b2 |V1 V3 ...V(2N \u22121) i. For this situation\none can easily show that the imperfection of the photon detectors reduces the success rate\nof the filter operation from 21 to 12 \u03b7 N . In general, for arbitrary photon target states, the\nfidelity of the filter operation is reduced and the success rate of the proposed quantum filter\ncan become very small in case of large photon numbers N and \u03b7 < 1. Further reductions\nof the filter fidelity and success rate can arise from the presence of dark counts. Such errors\nalso play a crucial role in previously proposed implementations of quantum filter operations\n[6, 7, 8]. However, the scheme we propose here has a significantly higher success rate in the\nideal case and is experimentally less demanding than what has been reported in Refs. [6, 7, 8].\n\n3\n\nConclusions\n\nWe described the realisation of a 2-photon parity filter that requires only two polarising beam\nsplitters, two photons prepared in a maximally entangled Bell state and two polarisation\nsensitive detectors. In the presence of ideal photon sources and photon detectors the success\nrate of the scheme equals p2 = 12 and is the highest that has been predicted so far without the\nhelp of universal two-qubit quantum gate operations and is reached here due to employing\nan entangled ancilla state as a resource. A generalisation of the proposed scheme to the Nphoton case is straightforward. We showed that the quantum filter (2) can be implemented\nwith the help of N polarising beam splitters and an N-photon GHZ state as a resource.\nRemarkably, the success rate of the filter remains 21 , irregardless of the size of the input\nstate.\nTo implement the quantum filter (2), the N polarising beam splitters compare the state\nof the incoming photons pairwise with the state of the ancilla photons. In Section 2, we\nshowed that a single polarising beam splitter can be used to realise a filter, which measures\npolarisation H or V , respectively, with unit efficiency. Preparing the ancilla photons, for\nexample, in the state |HH . . . Hi, would result in a filter that measures whether all target\nphotons are prepared in |Hi. However, since we compare the input state with a GHZ state,\n7\n\n\fwhich contains two terms, namely |HH . . . Hi and |V V . . . V i, the probability of the described filter is only as high as 21 . Indeed, the highly entangled N-photon GHZ state acts as\na \"mask\" for the filter.\nAcknowledgement. The authors thank T. Rudolph and F. Verstraete for stimulating discussions. Y. L.
