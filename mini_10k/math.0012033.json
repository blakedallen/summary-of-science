As chromatic polynomials are indeed polynomials [14, 15], their roots (called chromatic roots) have been intensively studied\nby combinatorialists [15]. Chromatic polynomials also arise in statistical physics as\nzero-temperature limits of the partition function of the z-state Potts antiferromagnet\non G (see e.g. [21]); and since the complex zeros of the partition function are closely\nlinked to phase transitions [24], physicists (or at least a few of them) have likewise\nbeen much interested in locating chromatic roots [19, 16].\nVery recently, one of us proved the following, which confirms a 1972 conjecture of\nBiggs, Damerell, and Sands [5]:\nTheorem 1.1 (Sokal [20]) If G is a graph of maximum degree k, then every chromatic root z of G lies in the disc |z| < 7.963907 k.\nWhile the constant 7.963907 found in [20] can likely be improved, the linearity of\nthe bound is best possible, since the complete graph Kk+1 (which has maximum\ndegree k) has a chromatic root at z = k.1 Nevertheless, suitably restricted subclasses\nof graphs might well satisfy a sublinear bound. For example, we conjecture that a\nsublinear bound in terms of maximum degree holds for all series-parallel graphs, and\nconceivably even for all planar graphs.\nA complementary approach is to bound the chromatic roots in terms of the corank\n(or cyclomatic number ) of the graph. Recall that a connected graph with n vertices\nand m edges has corank m \u2212 n + 1. One of us has recently proven:\nTheorem 1.2 (Brown [6]) If G is a graph of corank k \u2265 1, then every chromatic\nroot z of G lies in the disc |z \u2212 1| \u2264 k.\nUnlike the bound in terms of maximum degree, however, it is not known whether\nlinear growth with corank is best possible. Indeed, we suspect that it is not (see\nSection 6).\nNote also that Theorem 1.1 is in some sense radically \"more powerful\" than Theorem 1.2, in that maximum degree is a \"local\" quantity (i.e. a max over vertices), while\n1\n\nSurprisingly, the complete graph Kk+1 is not the extremal graph for this problem. A nonrigorous\n(but probably rigorizable) asymptotic analysis, confirmed by numerical calculations, shows [17] that\nthe complete bipartite graph Kk,k has a chromatic root \u03b1k + o(k), where \u03b1 = \u22122/W (\u22122/e) \u2248\n0.678345 + 1.447937i; here W denotes the principal branch of the Lambert W function (the inverse\nfunction of w 7\u2192 wew ) [10]. So the constant in Theorem 1.1 cannot be better than |\u03b1| \u2248 1.598960.\nGordon Royle (private communication) has conjectured that among all graphs of maximum degree\nk (k \u2265 4), the graph with the largest modulus of a chromatic root is Kk,k . We conjecture that this\nholds also when |z| is replaced by |z \u2212 1|, as is done in the present paper.\n\n2\n\n\fu\n\nv\n\nFigure 1: The graph \u03982,2,3 .\n\ncorank is a \"global\" quantity (i.e. a sum over vertices). Thus, if G is (for example) a\nregular graph of degree \u2206 \u2265 3 with n vertices, then the maximum degree is always \u2206\n(independent of n), while the corank is n(\u2206 \u2212 2)/2 + 1 (hence grows linearly with n).\nMore generally, for any 2-connected loopless graph we have cr(G) \u2265 \u2206(G) \u2212 1, where\ncr(G) is the corank and \u2206(G) is the maximum degree.2 Nevertheless, for some graphs\nTheorem 1.2 will give a sharper bound than Theorem 1.1, because of its prefactor 1\nin place of 7.963907.\nIn this paper, we shall examine a subclass of series-parallel graphs for which\nwe are able to prove a sublinear bound on the chromatic roots in terms of both\ncorank and maximum degree. The graphs in question are the generalized theta graphs\n\u0398s1 ,...,sk , which are formed by taking a pair of vertices u, v (called the endvertices) and\njoining them by k internally disjoint paths of lengths s1 , . . . , sk \u2265 1. (A generalized\ntheta graph with three paths is traditionally called a theta graph without adjectives.\nHowever, the rationale for singling out the case k = 3 seems more philological than\n2\n\nProof. Let G be a 2-connected loopless (multi)graph with n \u2265 1 vertices and m edges. The\nproof is by induction on m. If m = 0, then G = K1 and cr(G) = \u2206(G) = 0. If m = 1, then\nG = K2 and cr(G) = \u2206(G) \u2212 1 = 0. So suppose m \u2265 2. Then, by 2-connectedness, G cannot\nhave any degree-1 vertices. If G has a degree-2 vertex where the two edges connect to distinct\nvertices, then by contracting that vertex we obtain a loopless graph G\u2032 that is homeomorphic to\nG (hence 2-connected) and satisfies m(G\u2032 ) = m(G) \u2212 1, cr(G\u2032 ) = cr(G) and \u2206(G\u2032 ) = \u2206(G); so we\ncan apply the inductive hypothesis. Likewise, if G has somewhere k \u2265 2 parallel edges between the\nsame pair of distinct vertices, then by replacing those parallel edges by a single edge we obtain a\ngraph G\u2032 that is 2-connected and satisfies m(G\u2032 ) = m(G) \u2212 (k \u2212 1), cr(G\u2032 ) = cr(G) \u2212 (k \u2212 1) and\n\u2206(G\u2032 ) \u2265 \u2206(G) \u2212 (k \u2212 1); so again we can apply the inductive hypothesis. Finally, if G is a simple\ngraph of minimum degree \u2265 3 and maximum degree \u2206, then \u2206 \u2264 n \u2212 1 and m \u2265 [\u2206 + 3(n \u2212 1)]/2;\nthis implies cr(G) = m \u2212 n + 1 \u2265 [\u2206 + (n \u2212 1)]/2 \u2265 \u2206, which is even stronger than what we want\nto prove.\nThe same proof shows that if G is 2-connected and not series-parallel, then cr(G) \u2265 \u2206(G): it\nsuffices to observe that the two reductions (contraction of a degree-2 vertex and replacement of\nparallel edges by a single edge) preserve the property of being non-series-parallel, and that K2 is\nseries-parallel; therefore, after all the reductions we must be left with a simple graph of minimum\ndegree \u2265 3. [Remark: The smallest non-series-parallel graph, K4 , has cr(K4 ) = \u2206(K4 ) = 3.]\n\n3\n\n\fmathematical, so we shall often drop the adjective \"generalized\" when referring to\nk-ary theta graphs.) For brevity, we denote by \u0398(s,k) the k-ary theta graph whose\npath lengths are all equal to s. A k-ary theta graph clearly has maximum degree k\nand corank k \u2212 1 (except for the trivial case k = 1 with s1 \u2265 2, which has maximum\ndegree 2). The main result of the present paper is the following:\nTheorem 1.3 The chromatic roots of any k-ary generalized theta graph lie in the\ndisc |z \u2212 1| \u2264 [1 + o(1)] k/ log k, where o(1) denotes a constant C(k) that tends to\nzero as k \u2192 \u221e. (The precise bound is given in Theorem 3.2 and Proposition 3.4.)\nMoreover, we shall prove that this bound is asymptotically saturated by the graph\n\u0398(2,k) with all path lengths equal to 2 (which is isomorphic to the complete bipartite\ngraph K2,k ). Finally, we shall prove that for k \u2264 8, the k-ary generalized theta graph\nthat maximizes |z \u22121| over its chromatic roots z is the one with all path lengths equal\nto 2; we conjecture that this holds for all k.\nMore generally, for any finite graph G let us define\n\u03c1(G) = max{|z \u2212 1|: \u03c0(G, z) = 0} ,\n\n(1.1)\n\nand let us write specifically\n\u03c1(s1 , . . . , sk ) = \u03c1(\u0398s1 ,...,sk )\n\u03c1(s,k) = \u03c1(\u0398(s,k) )\n\n(1.2)\n(1.3)\n\nBroadly speaking, this paper will be concerned with finding upper and lower bounds\non \u03c1(s1 , . . . , sk ).\nThis paper is concerned, therefore, with the behavior of the chromatic roots of\n\u0398s1 ,...,sk when k is fixed (albeit large). A very different situation arises when k is\nunbounded: indeed, one of us has shown elsewhere [22] that the chromatic roots of\nthe graphs \u0398(s,k) (s, k \u2265 2), taken together, are dense in the whole complex plane\nexcept possibly for the disc |z \u2212 1| < 1!\nThe plan of this paper is as follows: In Section 2 we compute the chromatic\npolynomial of \u0398s1 ,...,sk . In Section 3 we prove Theorem 1.3. In Section 4 we use\na different method to obtain sharper (at least for small k) upper bounds on the\nchromatic roots of \u0398s1 ,...,sk ; as a corollary, we show that for k \u2264 8 the graph that\nmaximizes \u03c1(s1 , . . . , sk ) is the one with all path lengths equal to 2. In Section 5 we\nprove that \u0398(2,k) \u2243 K2,k indeed has a chromatic root of magnitude [1 + o(1)] k/ log k,\nso that Theorem 1.3 is asymptotically sharp. Finally, in Section 6 we discuss our\nresults and make some conjectures.\n\n4\n\n\f2\n\nChromatic Polynomial of Generalized Theta Graphs\n\nIt is well known that the chromatic polynomial of a cycle of length n is given by\n\u03c0(Cn , z) = (z \u2212 1)n + (\u22121)n (z \u2212 1) .\n\n(2.1)\n\nRecall also the well-known addition-contraction formula\n\u03c0(G, z) = \u03c0(G + e, z) + \u03c0(G \u2022 e, z)\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhere e is any edge not in G and G \u2022 e denotes the graph obtained from G by\ncontracting the endpoints of e. Finally, if two graphs G and H overlap in a complete\ngraph on l vertices, then\n\u03c0(G, z) \u03c0(H, z)\n.\nz(z \u2212 1) * * * (z \u2212 l + 1)\n\n\u03c0(G \u222a H, z) =\n\n(2.3)\n\nObserve now that if one adjoins to a generalized theta graph \u0398s1 ,...,sk a new edge\ne between the two endvertices, the resulting graph is a collection of cycles (of lengths\nsi + 1) that overlap in a complete graph K2 (namely the edge e), so that\n\n\u03c0(\u0398s1 ,...,sk + e, z) =\n\nk\nQ\n\n[(z \u2212 1)si +1 + (\u22121)si +1 (z \u2212 1)]\n\ni=1\n\n.\n\n[z(z \u2212 1)]k\u22121\n\n(2.4)\n\nLikewise, contraction of the endvertices of \u0398s1 ,...,sk yields a collection of cycles (of\nlengths si ) that overlap in a complete graph of order 1, so that\n\n\u03c0(\u0398s1 ,...,sk \u2022 e, z) =\n\nk\nQ\n\n[(z \u2212 1)si + (\u22121)si (z \u2212 1)]\n\ni=1\n\nz k\u22121\nIt follows that the chromatic polynomial of \u0398s1 ,...,sk is given by\n\n\u03c0(\u0398s1 ,...,sk , z) =\n\nk\nQ\n\n.\n\n(2.5)\n\n[(z \u2212 1)si +1 + (\u22121)si +1 (z \u2212 1)]\n\ni=1\n\n[z(z \u2212 1)]k\u22121\nk\nQ\n\n+\n\n[(z \u2212 1)si + (\u22121)si (z \u2212 1)]\n\ni=1\n\nz k\u22121\n\n(2.6a)\n\nk\nP\n\n\" k\nsi \u22121\n(1 \u2212 z) Y\n(\u22121)i=1\n=\n[(1 \u2212 z)si \u2212 1] \u2212\nz k\u22121\ni=1\n#\nk\nY\nk\u22121\nsi \u22121\n(1 \u2212 z)\n[(1 \u2212 z)\n\u2212 1] .\ni=1\n\n5\n\n(2.6b)\n\n\fTherefore, we need only concern ourselves with the roots of\nk\nk\nY\nY\nsi\n\u22121\nfs1 ,...,sk (y) =\n(y \u2212 1) \u2212 y\n(y si \u2212 y) ,\ni=1\n\n(2.7)\n\ni=1\n\nwhere y = 1 \u2212 z. All our subsequent calculations will be expressed in terms of the\nvariable y.\nLet us now dispose of some trivial cases. If k = 1, the theta graph \u0398s1 is isomorphic\nto the path Ps1 , so that its chromatic roots are 0 and 1. If k = 2, the theta graph\n\u0398s1 ,s2 is isomorphic to the cycle Cs1 +s2 , so that its chromatic roots (other than z = 1)\nall lie on the circle |z \u2212 1| = 1. We shall therefore assume henceforth that k \u2265 3.\nIf one or more of the path lengths si equals 1, then the second product in (2.7)\nvanishes, and all the chromatic roots (other than z = 1) again lie on the circle |y| = 1,\ni.e. |z \u2212 1| = 1. This can also be seen immediately from (2.1) and (2.3), as in this\ncase the graph \u0398s1 ,...,sk is a K2 \u2013bond of cycles (i.e. a collection of cycles overlapping\nin a single edge). We shall therefore assume henceforth that all path lengths si are\n\u2265 2.\nRemarks. 1. This method for computing \u03c0(\u0398s1 ,...,sk , z) was employed previously by\nRead and Tutte [15, pp. 29\u201330] for the case k = 3.\n2. See [22, Section 2] for a systematic method for computing the Potts-model\npartition function ZG (z, {ve }) [which generalizes the chromatic polynomial \u03c0(G, z)]\nfor any series-parallel graph, along with an explicit formula for generalized theta\ngraphs.\n\n3\n\nBounding the Chromatic Roots of Generalized\nTheta Graphs\n\nWe proceed now to prove Theorem 1.3, i.e. to show that the roots of fs1 ,...,sk (y) are\nbounded in modulus by [1 + o(1)] k/ log k. As just noted, it suffices to consider the\ncase k \u2265 3 and s1 , . . . , sk \u2265 2.\nObviously y = 1 (corresponding to z = 0) is a root of fs1 ,...,sk (y). All the other\nroots satisfy\nk\nY\ny si \u2212 y\n= y.\n(3.1)\ny si \u2212 1\ni=1\n\nTherefore, to show that a given number y \u2208 C is not a root, it suffices to show that\nthe left-hand side of (3.1) is strictly smaller in modulus than the right-hand side. We\nshall do this in the crudest possible way, taking account only of the magnitude of y,\n\n6\n\n\fi.e. throwing away all phase information. So, define\nXs (R) = sup\n|y|=R\n\nys \u2212 y\nys \u2212 1\n\n(3.2)\n\nfor integer s \u2265 2 and real R > 1.\nLemma 3.1\n(a) For integer s \u2265 2 and real R > 1, we have\ns\nes (R) \u2261 R + R ,\nXs (R) \u2264 X\nRs \u2212 1\n\n(3.3)\n\nwith equality for s even [attained uniquely in (3.2) when y = \u2212R] and strict\ninequality for s odd.\nes (R) are strictly decreasing functions of R\n(b) For integer s \u2265 2, both Xs (R) and X\non the interval 1 < R < \u221e. They tend to +\u221e as R \u2193 1, and to 1 as R \u2192 \u221e.\n\nes (R) is a strictly decreasing function of s on s \u2265 2.\n(c) For R > 1, X\n\nProof. (a) The inequality (3.3) is trivial. Equality holds if and only if we simultaneously have y s\u22121 negative real and y s positive real. Writing y = Rei\u03b8 with 0 \u2264 \u03b8 < 2\u03c0,\na simple computation shows that this occurs if and only if s is even and \u03b8 = \u03c0. Thus,\nfor s odd we have |(y s \u2212 y)/(y s \u2212 1)| < (Rs + R)/(Rs \u2212 1) for all y on the circle of\nradius R; and since this circle is compact, the maximum is attained; so (3.3) is a\nstrict inequality.\n(b,c) The function g(y) = (y s \u2212 y)/(y s \u2212 1) is analytic in the domain |y| > 1,\nincluding at the point y = \u221e; so by the maximum modulus theorem, its maximum\non the domain |y| \u2265 R (with R > 1) is attained only on the boundary |y| = R. This\nproves (invoking again the compactness of circles) that Xs (R) is a strictly decreasing\nes (R) = 1 + (R +\nfunction of R for R > 1. Finally, simple calculus shows that X\n1)/(Rs \u2212 1) is a strictly decreasing function of R on R > 1; and it is trivially a strictly\ndecreasing function of s.\n\u2737\nRemarks. 1. For s odd, the maximum in (3.2) lies at a nontrivial angle \u03b8, which\ntends to \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0/(s \u2212 1) as R \u2192 \u221e and to \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0/s as R \u2193 1.3\n3\n\nProof. Let y = Rei\u03b8 . As R \u2192 \u221e we have\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n1\n1\nys \u2212 y\n= 1 \u2212 s\u22121 + s + O 2s\u22121 .\nys \u2212 1\ny\ny\ny\n\n7\n\n\f2. For s odd, both sides of (3.3) have the same leading asymptotic behavior as\nR \u2192 \u221e, namely 1 + 1/Rs\u22121 + O(1/Rs ). So the inequality (3.3) is asymptotically\nsharp.\nIt follows that if\n\nk\nY\ni=1\n\nes (R) \u2264 R ,\nX\ni\n\n(3.4)\n\nthen fs1 ,...,sk (y) has no roots in the region |y| > R. Now, the left-hand side of (3.4) is a\nstrictly decreasing function of R on 1 < R < \u221e, which tends to +\u221e as R \u2193 1 and to 1\nas R \u2192 \u221e; while the right-hand side is a strictly increasing function of R, which tends\nto 1 as R \u2193 1 and to +\u221e as R \u2192 \u221e. So there is a unique R = R(s1 , . . . , sk ) where\nthey are equal. Moreover, since the left-hand side of (3.4) is a strictly decreasing\nfunction of each si , it follows that R(s1 , . . . , sk ) is a strictly decreasing function of\neach si ; in particular, R(s1 , . . . , sk ) \u2264 R(2, . . . , 2) \u2261 R(2,k) . [When all the si are\nequal, we write R(s, . . . , s) = R(s,k) .] In summary, we have proven:\nTheorem 3.2 All the chromatic roots of \u0398s1 ,...,sk lie in the disc |z\u22121| \u2264 R(s1 , . . . , sk ).\nIn particular, they all lie in the disc |z \u2212 1| \u2264 R(2,k) .\nTo complete the proof of Theorem 1.3, we need to obtain an upper bound on\ne2 (R) = R/(R \u2212 1), we see that R(2,k) is the unique root in\nR\n. Since X2 (R) = X\n(1, \u221e) of the equation\n\u0012\n\u0013k\nR\n= R\n(3.5)\nR\u22121\n(2,k)\n\nor equivalently\n\nor\n\n\u0012\n\nR\nR\u22121\n\n\u0013k\u22121\n\n= R\u22121\n\nRk\u22121 = (R \u2212 1)k .\n\n(3.6)\n(3.7)\n\nThe asymptotic behavior as k \u2192 \u221e of the solution to (3.5)\u2013(3.7) is surprisingly\nintricate and involves the Lambert W function [10], i.e. the inverse function to w 7\u2192\nwew . Here we shall limit ourselves to proving some elementary inequalities, without\nderiving the full asymptotics. For further details, see Section 5 below and [23].\nThe sum of the first two terms has maximum modulus when ei\u03b8 is an (s \u2212 1)st root of \u22121, i.e. when\n\u03b8 = (2k + 1)\u03c0/(s \u2212 1) with 0 \u2264 k \u2264 s \u2212 2; and among these, the third term has maximum real part\nwhen k = (s \u2212 1)/2 and (s \u2212 3)/2, i.e. when \u03b8 = \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0/(s \u2212 1). As R \u2193 1, the denominator dominates,\nso we want ei\u03b8 to be an sth root of unity, i.e. \u03b8 = 2\u03c0k/s with 0 \u2264 k \u2264 s \u2212 1; and among these, the\nnumerator has maximum modulus when y s\u22121 has the largest negative real part, which occurs when\nk = (s \u00b1 1)/2, i.e. when \u03b8 = \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0/s.\n\n8\n\n\fLemma 3.3 For x \u2265 0, let W (x) be the unique real solution of W (x)eW (x) = x.\nThen:\n(a) W (x) is a continuous (in fact, real-analytic) and strictly increasing function of\nx, satisfying W (0) = 0 and lim W (x) = +\u221e.\nx\u2192+\u221e\n\n(b) x/W (x) = eW (x) is a continuous (in fact, real-analytic) and strictly increasing\nfunction of x, satisfying lim x/W (x) = 1 and lim x/W (x) = +\u221e.\nx\u2192+\u221e\n\nx\u21930\n\n(c) For all x > e,\nlog x \u2212 log log x < W (x) < log x .\n\n(3.8)\n\nProof. (a) follows immediately from the fact that wew is a real-analytic function of\nw \u2265 0 with everywhere strictly positive derivative, which runs from 0 to +\u221e as w\nruns from 0 to +\u221e. (b) follows from (a) and the defining equation W (x)eW (x) = x. To\nprove (c), note that W (e) = 1, so that for x > e we have W (x) > 1 by (a); it follows\nthat W (x) = log x \u2212 log W (x) < log x and hence also that W (x) = log x \u2212 log W (x) >\nlog x \u2212 log log x.\n\u2737\nProposition 3.4 For k \u2265 2 we have\nk\nk\u22121\n< R(2,k) <\n+ 1.\nW (k)\nW (k \u2212 1)\n\n(3.9)\n\nIn particular, for k \u2265 3 we have\nk\u22121\nk\n< R(2,k) <\n+ 1.\nlog k\nlog(k \u2212 1) \u2212 log log(k \u2212 1)\n\n(3.10)\n\nIt suffices to prove (3.9), as (3.10) then follows from Lemma 3.3.\nProof of lower bound. Since the left (resp. right) side of (3.5) is a strictly\ndecreasing (resp. strictly increasing) function of R, it suffices to prove that the left\nside is larger than the right side when R = k/W (k).

The general bounds of the previous section\nare not, however, strong enough to prove this conjecture. Nevertheless, by different\ntechniques we shall show the validity of this conjecture for all k \u2264 8. As before, it\nsuffices to consider k \u2265 3 and s1 , . . . , sk \u2265 2. We recall that \u03c1(s1 , . . . , sk ) denotes the\nmaximum modulus of a root of fs1 ,...,sk (y).\nOur method is based on the following trivial bound (see e.g. [13, Theorem 27.1]):\nn\nP\nProposition 4.1 Let P (y) =\naj y j be a polynomial of degree n (so that an 6= 0),\nj=0\n\nand let R be the unique nonnegative real solution of\n|an |Rn \u2212\n\nn\u22121\nX\n\n|aj |Rj = 0 .\n\nj=0\n\n10\n\n(4.1)\n\n\fThen all the roots of P lie in the disc |y| \u2264 R. Moreover, in (4.1) the numbers |aj |\nfor 0 \u2264 j \u2264 n \u2212 1 can be replaced by any numbers bj \u2265 |aj |; this only makes the bound\nweaker.\nAt first sight it is surprising that such a crude estimation method - which throws\naway all the sign or phase information in the coefficients of P - could yield reasonably\nsharp results. And indeed, we do not entirely understand why it works so well in our\napplication - but it does! Here is the key trick: since the polynomial fs1 ,...,sk (y)\ndefined in (2.7) is divisible by (y \u2212 1)k , we are free to pull out a factor (y \u2212 1)l with\nany 0 \u2264 l \u2264 k before applying Proposition 4.1. It turns out that the right choice is\nto take l = 1 (in the Remark below we shall give some intuition as to why this is a\ngood choice). That is, we define the polynomial \u03c6s1 ,...,sk (y) by\nfs1 ,...,sk (y)\n.\n(4.2)\ny\u22121\n\u0001\nLet [k] denote the set {1, . . . , k}, and let [k]\ndenote the set of all subsets of [k] of\nl\ncardinality l.

Note that in \u03c6s1 ,...,sk (y), the first subleading term with a + sign (which\ncomes from m = 3) is down by a factor y s1+s2 +s3 \u22122 = y \u22654 compared to the leading\nterm, where s1 , s2 , s3 \u2265 2 are the three smallest path lengths. Since y > 1, this helps\nProposition 4.1 to be close to sharp.\nWe can now implement Proposition 4.1 by defining hs1 ,...,sk (y) to be the polynomial obtained from \u03c6s1 ,...,sk (y) by changing all subleading signs to \u2212 as in (4.1),\nand letting r(s1 , . . . , sk ) be the unique positive root of hs1 ,...,sk (y). We then have\n\u03c1(s1 , . . . , sk ) \u2264 r(s1 , . . . , sk ). Unfortunately, this bound is unsuitable for our present\npurposes, as r(s1 , . . . , sk ) is not a monotonically decreasing function of the path\nlengths s1 , . . . , sk (see Table 1 and Remark 2 below). We therefore throw away a\nbit more, by disregarding all sign cancellations among the subleading terms of (4.4),\nand define\nP\n\ne\nhs1 ,...,sk (y) = y (\n\nsi )\u22121\n\n\u2212\n\nk\nX\n\nX\n\nm=2 X\u2286(\n\ny sX (1 + y + * * * + y m\u22122 ) .\n\n(4.5)\n\n[k]\nk\u2212m\n\n)\n\n[Thus, the coefficient of y j in (4.5) is in general larger in magnitude than in (4.4).] Let\nre(s1 , . . . , sk ) be the unique positive root of e\nhs1 ,...,sk (y).

To prove the decreasing property, fix s1 , . . . , sk and\nset r = re(s1 , s2 , . . . , sk ); by symmetry, it suffices to show that re(s1 + 1, s2 , . . . , sk ) < r.\nNow, it is clear from equation (4.5) that r > 1.

Moreover, the degrees of y s1 A(y) and B(y) are less than ( pi=1 si ) \u2212 1,\n12\n\n\fPk\n\nand B(0) = 1. It follows that r (\n\ni=1 si )\n\ne\nhs1 +1,s2 ,...,sk (r) = r\n\n\u2212 r s1 A(r) > 0. Now from (4.7) we have\n\nPk\n\ni=1 si\n\n\u2212 r s1+1 A(r) \u2212 B(r)\n\u0010 Pk\n\u0011\n= r * r ( i=1 si )\u22121 \u2212 r s1 A(r) \u2212 B(r)\nPk\n\n> r(\n= e\nhs\n\ni=1 si )\u22121\n\n1 ,s2 ,...,sk\n\n\u2212 r s1 A(r) \u2212 B(r)\n\n(r)\n\n= 0.\n\n(4.8)\n\nIt follows that re(s1 + 1, s2 , . . . , sk ) < r = re(s1 , s2 , . . . , sk ), completing the proof.\n\n\u2737\n\nWhat may be surprising is how well the roots of h and e\nh bound the roots of f\nfor small k (see Table 1). In particular, they are considerably better than the bound\nR(s1 , . . . , sk ) from Theorem 3.2, and they are good enough to prove:\nTheorem 4.4 For 3 \u2264 k \u2264 8, we have \u03c1(s1 , . . . , sk ) \u2264 \u03c1(2,k) , with equality only when\ns1 = * * * = sk = 2. In other words, among all k-ary theta graphs, the graph with a\nchromatic root that maximizes |z \u2212 1| is the one with all path lengths equal to 2.\n\nProof. By direct calculation (see Table 1) we have re(2, 2, 3) < \u03c1(2, 2, 2), re(2, 2, 2, 3) <\n\u03c1(2, 2, 2, 2) and re(2, 2, 2, 2, 3) < \u03c1(2, 2, 2, 2, 2). The result for 3 \u2264 k \u2264 5 then follows\nimmediately from Propositions 4.2 and 4.3. For k = 6, 7, a bit more work is needed:\nthe calculations show that \u03c1(2, . . . , 2, 2, 3), re(2, . . . , 2, 2, 4) and re(2, . . . , 2, 3, 3) are\nall bounded above by \u03c1(2, . . . , 2, 2, 2), so that the result again follows from Propositions 4.2 and 4.3. Finally, for k = 8, the calculations show that \u03c1(2, . . . , 2, 2, 3),\n\u03c1(2, . . . , 2, 2, 4), re(2, . . . , 2, 2, 5) and re(2, . . . , 2, 3, 3) are all bounded above by \u03c1(2, . . . ,\n2, 2, 2), which is again sufficient.\n\u2737\nRemarks. 1. This method of proof relies in an essential way on the fact that, for\n3 \u2264 k \u2264 8, only finitely many of the upper bounds re(s1 , . . . , sk ) are larger than\nthe true value \u03c1(2, . . . , 2) \u2261 \u03c1(2,k) . Unfortunately, this fails for k = 9: indeed, we\nhave lim re(s1 , . . . , sk\u22121 , sk ) = re(s1 , . . . , sk\u22121 ) and in particular lim re(2, . . . , 2, s9 ) =\nsk \u2192\u221e\n\n(2,8)\n\ns9 \u2192\u221e\n\n(2,9)\n\nre\n\u2248 3.7959050193 > 3.7468849281 \u2248 \u03c1 . So a genuinely new method will be\nrequired to prove Theorem 4.4 for k \u2265 9.\n2. Contrary to what one might expect, neither the true value \u03c1(s1 , . . . , sk ) nor\nthe upper bound r(s1 , . . . , sk ) is monotone decreasing in s1 , . . . , sk (see Table 1).\nNor does this arise merely from even-odd oscillations: the weaker conjecture that\n\u03c1(s1 , . . . , sk\u22121 , sk + 2) \u2264 \u03c1(s1 , . . . , sk\u22121 , sk ) for even s1 , . . . , sk \u2265 2 is also false, as\nis the corresponding conjecture for r: this is illustrated by the case (s1 , . . . , s5 ) =\n(2, 2, 2, 2, 4) among many others.\n13\n\n\fPath length sequence\n(s1 , . . . , sk )\n(2, 2, 2)\n(2, 2, 3)\n(2, 2, 2, 2)\n(2, 2, 2, 3)\n(2, 2, 2, 2, 2)\n(2, 2, 2, 2, 3)\n(2, 2, 2, 2, 4)\n(2, 2, 2, 2, 5)\n(2, 2, 2, 2, 6)\n(2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2)\n(2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3)\n(2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4)\n(2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3)\n(2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2)\n(2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3)\n(2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4)\n(2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3)\n(2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2)\n(2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3)\n(2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4)\n(2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 5)\n(2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3)\n(2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2)\n(2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3)\n(2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4)\n(2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 5)\n(2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 6)\n(2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 7)\n(2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8)\n(2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 9)\n(2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 10)\n(2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 11)\n(2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 12)\n(2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 13)\n(2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3)\n\nActual value\n\u03c1(s1 , . . . , sk )\n1.5247025799\n1.3247179572\n1.9635530390\n1.6180339887\n2.3602010481\n1.9596554046\n1.9125157044\n2.0227195761\n1.9492237868\n2.7305222731\n2.3291754791\n2.3208606055\n2.0524815723\n3.0823336669\n2.6933092033\n2.7030241913\n2.3573224846\n3.4201564280\n3.0446178232\n3.0625912820\n3.0953618332\n2.6885399588\n3.7468849281\n3.3836067543\n3.4054981704\n3.4292505541\n3.4182415134\n3.4200422197\n3.4203605983\n3.4200947731\n3.4201605551\n3.4201602535\n3.4201547358\n3.4201566935\n3.0254986086\n\nr(s1 , . . . , sk )\n1.5905667405\n1.4655712319\n2.0652388409\n1.8003794650\n2.4788311017\n2.0481965587\n2.0726410424\n2.1137657905\n2.0928219450\n2.8521866737\n2.4702504048\n2.4487347678\n2.2641426827\n3.1959268744\n2.8543267466\n2.8316875864\n2.4527687226\n3.5685068590\n3.2040479885\n3.2129169213\n3.1953189320\n2.8486049323\n3.9272779941\n3.5282506474\n3.5867024115\n3.5677746122\n3.5704257784\n3.5685857538\n3.5684058522\n3.5685249008\n3.5685220773\n3.5685079914\n3.5685071412\n3.5685072051\n3.2079141314\n\nUpper bound\nre(s1 , . . . , sk )\n1.5905667405\n1.4655712319\n2.0959187459\n1.9038165409\n2.5569445891\n2.3283569921\n2.2158195963\n2.1572723181\n2.1267590770\n2.9891971006\n2.7400794700\n2.6342641478\n2.5176585462\n3.4006086206\n3.1395749040\n3.0429807861\n2.8983449779\n3.7959050193\n3.5278440533\n3.4402140830\n3.4125677445\n3.2745245420\n4.1781887719\n3.9060114610\n3.8263498519\n3.8040844502\n3.7980747620\n3.7964779130\n3.7960560504\n3.7959448158\n3.7959155041\n3.7959077815\n3.7959057470\n3.7959052110\n3.6449248003\n\nR(s1 , . . . , sk )\n3.1478990357\n2.8235871268\n3.6296581268\n3.3067093454\n4.0795956235\n3.7595287461\n3.6668970270\n3.6401168028\n3.6325613931\n4.5063232460\n4.1896653876\n4.1075181051\n3.8793014522\n4.9150761863\n4.6019501648\n4.5281826533\n4.2931001487\n5.3093300653\n4.9996840573\n4.9327412477\n4.9187003835\n4.6929626253\n5.6915378807\n5.3852446658\n5.3239577745\n5.3121036374\n5.3098533475\n5.3094286637\n5.3093486377\n5.3093335634\n5.3093307241\n5.3093301894\n5.3093300886\n5.3093300697\n5.0809413850\n\nTable 1: Values of \u03c1(s1 , . . . , sk ) and its upper bounds r(s1 , . . . , sk ) \u2264 re(s1 , . . . , sk ).\nFor comparison, the upper bound R(s1 , . . . , sk ) from Theorem 3.2 is also shown.\n14\n\n\f5\n\nThe Chromatic Roots of \u0398(2,k) \u2243 K2,k\n\nThe results of the previous sections suggest that \u0398(2,k) , which is isomorphic to the\ncomplete bipartite graph K2,k , may very well contain a root that maximizes |z \u2212 1|\nover all k-ary theta graphs. It is therefore of interest to study in detail the chromatic\nroots of K2,k and in particular their behavior as k \u2192 \u221e. In this section we shall show\nthat the bound \u03c1(s1 , . . . , sk ) \u2264 R(2,k) \u2248 [1 + o(1)] k/ log k found in Theorem 3.2 and\nProposition 3.4 is indeed asymptotically attained by K2,k . To do so, we shall need to\ncarry out a rather in-depth study of the roots of certain trinomials.\nFrom (2.6) we have\n\u03c0(K2,k , z) = z(z \u2212 1)[(z \u2212 2)k + (z \u2212 1)k\u22121] ,\n\n(5.1)\n\nso that the chromatic roots of K2,k (aside from z = 0 and z = 1) are given by the\nequation\n(z \u2212 2)k + (z \u2212 1)k\u22121 = 0 .\n(5.2)\nBy the Beraha\u2013Kahane\u2013Weiss theorem [2, 3, 1, 4, 22], the solutions of (5.2) accumulate as k \u2192 \u221e on the curve where |z \u2212 2| = |z \u2212 1|, namely the vertical line\nRe z = 3/2, and only there. We were therefore somewhat surprised to compute numerically the solutions of (5.2) and find that a few of the roots lie far to the right of\nthe line Re z = 3/2: see e.g. the open-circled points in Figure 2(a) for k = 10. In\nretrospect, however, one realizes that this behavior is perfectly consistent with the\nBeraha\u2013Kahane\u2013Weiss theorem: the limiting curve Re z = 3/2 contains the point at\ninfinity, and roots can tend to infinity in the topology of the Riemann sphere (which\nturns out to be the relevant sense) in many different ways; in particular, their real\nparts need not tend to 3/2. In fact, as we shall see, the rightmost root has\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\nk\n\u03c0i\nlog log k\nz =\n1\u00b1\n+O\n,\n(5.3)\nlog k \u2212 log log k\nlog k\nlog2 k\nso that its real and imaginary parts both tend to infinity as k \u2192 \u221e, with |z| having\nexactly the magnitude [1+o(1)] k/ log k predicted by Theorem 3.2 and Proposition 3.4.\nThe asymptotic behavior as k \u2192 \u221e of the solutions to (5.2) is surprisingly subtle,\nand involves the Lambert W function [10]. Here we shall give a brief treatment that\nleads as directly as possible to the main result (5.3), deferring a full analysis to a later\npaper [23] (see also [11, 12] for related work).\nIt is useful to study, in place of (5.2), the more general equation\n(z \u2212 2)k \u2212 \u03bb(z \u2212 1)k\u22121 = 0\n\n(5.4)\n\nwith any fixed \u03bb 6= 0 (\u03bb \u2208 C). In particular, \u03bb = \u22121 corresponds to the chromatic\nroots, while the equation with \u03bb = +1 has a positive real root z = 1 + R(2,k) where\n15\n\n\fR(2,k) is the bound given in Theorem 3.2 [cf. (3.7)]. See Figure 2(a) for the curve of\nroots corresponding to |\u03bb| = 1, for the case k = 10.\nIt is also convenient to make the fractional-linear change of variables\n\u03b6 =\n\nz\u22121\n,\nz\u22122\n\n(5.5)\n\nso that the equation (5.4) becomes\n\u03b6 k \u2212 \u03b6 k\u22121 \u2212 \u03bb = 0\n\n(5.6)\n\nand the limiting curve Re z = 3/2 becomes the unit circle |\u03b6| = 1. In particular, the\npoint z = \u221e corresponds to \u03b6 = 1. See Figure 2(b) for the corresponding loci of roots\nin the \u03b6-plane, for the case k = 10.\nWhen k \u2192 \u221e at fixed \u03bb 6= 0, all the roots of (5.6) tend to the unit circle |\u03b6| = 1,\nas just noted; but the rate at which they do so is rather subtle, most notably for\nthose roots near \u03b6 = 1. To investigate the large-k asymptotics of the roots of (5.6)\nnear \u03b6 = 1, let us begin by writing \u03b6 = ew/k with |w/k| \u226a 1 and inserting this in\n(5.6): we have\nh\n\u0010 w \u0011i\n.\n(5.7)\nwew = k\u03bb 1 + O\nk\nThis suggests that to a first approximation we will have\nw = W (k\u03bb)\n\n(5.8)\n\nwhere W (z) is the Lambert W function [10], i.e. the (multivalued) inverse function\nto w 7\u2192 wew , and distinct branches of W (z) will correspond to distinct roots of the\ntrinomial. The large-z behavior of W (z) is rather complicated [10], but the first two\nterms of its expansion are\n\u0013\n\u0012\nlog log z\n,\n(5.9)\nW (z) = log z \u2212 log log z + O\nlog z\nso that indeed we will have |w/k| \u2248 | log k/k| \u226a 1 for large k (provided that arg \u03bb is\nnot taken too large).\nLet us henceforth define w by (5.8), using any branch of the Lambert W function\nwe please, and write\nhw\ni\n\u03b6 = exp (1 + \u03be) ,\n(5.10)\nk\nwhere we expect |\u03be| \u226a 1 for large k. Inserting this into (5.6), we obtain the fundamental equation\n1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03c4 (1+\u03be)\n= e\u2212w\u03be ,\n(5.11)\n\u03c4\n16\n\n\f4\no\n\n2\no\no\no\no\no\no\no\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\no\n-2\n\no\n-4\n\n(a)\n\n1.5\n\n1 o\no\n\no\n0.5\n\no\n\n-1.5\n\n-1\n\no\n\n-0.5\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\no\n\no\n-0.5\no\n\no\n-1 o\n\n(b)\n\n-1.5\n\nFigure 2: Solution curve of the trinomial equation (5.4)/(5.6) for |\u03bb| = 1, with\nk = 10.

Plot (a) shows the complex z-plane; plot (b)\nshows the complex \u03b6-plane.\n17\n\n\fwhere we have set\n\nw\n.\n(5.12)\nk\nOur strategy will now be to investigate the equation (5.11), with w and \u03c4 considered\nas independent complex parameters, and seek a convergent power-series solution\n\u03c4 =\n\n\u03be(w, \u03c4 ) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nfl (w) \u03c4 l\n\n(5.13)\n\nl=1\n\nvalid for |\u03c4 | < A(w). Indeed, the implicit function theorem guarantees that such a\nsolution exists for small enough |\u03c4 |, provided that w 6= \u22121. In view of the special role\nplayed by w = \u22121, it is convenient to make the further change of variables\nv =\n\n1\n,\n1+w\n\n(5.14)\n\nso that the fundamental equation (5.11) becomes\n1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03c4 (1+\u03be)\n= e(1\u22121/v)\u03be\n\u03c4\n\n(5.15)\n\nand the power-series solution will be\n\u03be(v, \u03c4 ) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\ngl (v) \u03c4 l .\n\n(5.16)\n\nl=1\n\nStarting from (5.15), let us take the logarithm of both sides, subtract \u03be, and\nmultiply by \u2212v: we get\n\u0014 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0015\n1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03c4 (1+\u03be)\n\u03be = \u2212v log\n+ log(1 + \u03be) \u2212 \u03be .\n(5.17)\n\u03c4 (1 + \u03be)\nWe intend to prove that, whenever |\u03c4 | \u2264 A and |v| \u2264 B, the equation (5.17) has a\nunique solution \u03be = \u03be(v, \u03c4 ) lying in the disc |\u03be| \u2264 R, provided that A, B, R satisfy\nsuitable inequalities. To prove this, we shall apply Rouch\u00e9's theorem to (5.17), taking\nthe left-hand side as the \"large\" function f (\u03be) and the right-hand side as the \"small\"\nfunction g(\u03be).

Our main\nresult, Theorem 1.3, therefore naturally suggests extensions in two different directions:\n(a) a sublinear bound in terms of maximum degree for larger classes of series-parallel\n(or perhaps even planar) graphs, and\n(b) a sublinear bound in terms of corank for larger classes of graphs, and possibly\neven for arbitrary graphs.\nWe discuss these conjectures in turn:\n\n6.1\n\nBounds in terms of maximum degree\n\nTheorem 1.1 provides a linear bound in terms of maximum degree for the chromatic\nroots of arbitrary graphs. For general graphs, such a bound is best possible except for\nthe numerical value of the prefactor, since the complete graph Kk+1 has a chromatic\nroot at z = k. On the other hand, suitably restricted subclasses of graphs might well\nsatisfy a sublinear bound, as we have shown in Theorem 1.3 for generalized theta\ngraphs, whose chromatic roots are bounded by [1 + o(1)] k/ log k. We conjecture that\nthe techniques of Section 3 can be extended to handle arbitrary series-parallel graphs:\nConjecture 6.1 There exists a universal constant C < \u221e such that the chromatic\nroots of any series-parallel graph of maximum degree k lie in the disc |z \u2212 1| \u2264\nCk/ log k.\nMore strongly, we conjecture that the chromatic roots lie in the same disc |z \u2212 1| \u2264\nR(2,k) that we have established in Theorem 3.2 for generalized theta graphs. Indeed,\nit is quite possible that among series-parallel graphs the worst case is always the\ngeneralized theta graph \u0398(2,k) \u2243 K2,k , so that the roots lie in the disc |z \u2212 1| \u2264 \u03c1(2,k) ;\nthis generalizes the conjectured extension of Theorem 4.4 to k \u2265 9.\nSeries-parallel graphs are a subset of planar graphs, so it is conceivable that a\nsublinear bound in terms of maximum degree holds even for all planar graphs. But\nwe have no idea how to prove such a result, nor do we have any compelling reason to\nbelieve it is true.\nAnother direction in which Theorems 1.1 and 1.3 could be extended is by finding\na criterion weaker than bounded maximum degree under which the chromatic roots\ncould be shown to be bounded (whether linearly or sublinearly). Indeed, already in\n\n21\n\n\f[20] it was shown \"maximum degree\" in Theorem 1.1 can be replaced by \"secondlargest degree\", provided that the bound 7.963907 k is replaced by 7.963907 k + 1.5\nAnd it was conjectured there (inspired by [18]) that \"second-largest degree\" can be\nfurther weakened to \"maxmaxflow\", defined as\n\u039b(G) = max \u03bb(x, y)\n\n(6.1)\n\n\u03bb(x, y) = max # of edge-disjoint paths from x to y\n= min # of edges separating x from y\n\n(6.2a)\n(6.2b)\n\nx6=y\n\nwhere\n\n(Clearly \u03bb(x, y) \u2264 min[deg(x), deg(y)] and hence \u039b(G) \u2264 second-largest degree of G.)\nIn other words, it was conjectured that\nConjecture 6.2 ([18, 20]) There exist universal constants C(k) < \u221e such that the\nchromatic roots of any graph G with \u039b(G) = k lie in the disc |z \u2212 1| \u2264 C(k).\nIndeed, it is natural to expect that C(k) can be taken to be linear in k. We do not\nhave, at present, any good idea how to prove this conjecture for arbitrary graphs, but\nwe suspect that the methods of Section 3 can be extended to prove it for series-parallel\ngraphs.\n\n6.2\n\nBounds in terms of corank\n\nRecalling the definition \u03c1(G) = max{|z \u2212 1|: \u03c0(G, z) = 0}, let us now define the\nnumbers\n\u03c1k = max{\u03c1(G): graphs G of corank k} .\n(6.3)\nObviously \u03c10 = \u03c11 = 1. Note also that \u03c1k+1 \u2265 \u03c1k : for if G is any graph of corank\nk, then the disjoint union of G and a cycle Cn has corank k + 1 (and its chromatic\nroots are those of G and the cycle). Note, finally, that in the definition of \u03c1k we can\nrestrict attention to 2-connected graphs: for we can separate G into its 2-connected\ncomponents and then glue these components back together along a common edge to\nform a graph G\u2032 of the same corank as G; and by the l = 0, 1, 2 cases of (2.3), the\nchromatic roots of G\u2032 are exactly those of G (except that the multiplicities of the\nroots at 0 and 1 may be reduced).\n5\n\nThis result cannot be extended further to \"third-largest degree\": for as soon as G has two\nvertices of large degree, the chromatic roots can become unbounded. Indeed, the chromatic roots\nof the generalized theta graphs \u0398(s,k) , when s and k are both allowed to vary without bound, are\ndense in the entire complex plane except possibly for the disc |z \u2212 1| < 1 [22].\n\n22\n\n\fTheorem 1.2 asserts that \u03c1k \u2264 k for k \u2265 1. In the other direction, Theorem 1.3\nand Corollary 5.2 together show that \u03c1k \u2265 \u03c1(2,k+1) = [1 + o(1)] k/ log k. It is clearly\nof interest to know whether the asymptotic growth of \u03c1k is linear or sublinear.\nLet us begin by examining small values of k. As noted above, \u03c10 = \u03c11 = 1. The\nonly 2-connected graphs of corank 2 are 3-ary theta graphs, so Theorem 4.4 implies\nthat \u03c12 = \u03c1(2, 2, 2) \u2248 1.5247. We initially conjectured that an analogous result might\nhold for all k, i.e. that the corank-k graph with the largest value of \u03c1(G) would be\nthe (k + 1)-ary theta graph \u0398(2,k+1) , so that \u03c1k would equal \u03c1(2, . . . , 2) = \u03c1(2,k+1) .\nSadly, this is not the case, as \u03c13 \u2265 2 (since z = 3 is a chromatic root of K4 ), while\n\u03c1(2, 2, 2, 2) \u2248 1.9636 (see Table 1). However, this is the only counterexample we have\nfound, so we pose the following conjecture:\nConjecture 6.3 Let G be a a graph of corank k \u2265 1. Then, if G 6= K4 , we have\n\u03c1(G) \u2264 \u03c1(2,k+1) . In particular, for k \u2265 4 we have \u03c1k = \u03c1(2,k+1) .\nIn particular, we expect:\nConjecture 6.4 (a corollary of Conjecture 6.3) \u03c1k = [1 + o(1)] k/ log k as k \u2192\n\u221e.\nNote that asymptotically, complete graphs will lag far behind generalized theta graphs,\nas \u03c1(Kn ) = n \u2212 2, and the corank of Kn is (n2 \u2212 3n + 2)/2; the corresponding gen2\neralized theta graph with the same corank, \u0398(2,1+(n \u22123n+2)/2) \u2243 K2,1+(n2 \u22123n+2)/2 , has,\nfrom Corollary 5.2, a chromatic root z such that |z \u2212 1| is approximately n2 /(4 log n),\nwhich is much larger than n \u2212 2.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe wish to thank Karl Dilcher for many helpful conversations concerning the roots of\ntrinomials, and for sharing with us his unpublished notes [12].
