At a fixed field in the hysteretic regions, the resistance exhibits an\nunusual time dependence, consisting of random, bidirectional jumps followed by slow relaxations.\nThese anomalies are apparently caused by instabilities in the charge distribution of the two layers.\nPACS numbers: 73.50.-h, 71.70.Ej, 73.43.Qt\n\nHysteretic phenomena are widespread in nature. They\nare common magnetic materials, and often indicate a\nnon-equilibrium situation associated with a phase transition and the presence of domains [1]. Recently, hysteresis\nhas also been reported in various two-dimensional (2D)\ncarrier systems in semiconductor structures at low temperatures and high magnetic fields [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. In\nthese cases, magneto-resistance (\u03c1xx ) hysteresis appears\nin the quantum Hall (QH) regime when two Landau levels (LLs) with opposite spin are brought into coincidence.\nWhile the 2D systems studied have been notably different, the common thread in these experiments is that\nthere is a magnetic transition involving the carrier spin\n[8].\nHere we present hysteretic \u03c1xx data in 2D bilayer systems in the QH regime. The hysteresis in these systems\nhas a different origin and is caused by a non-equilibrium\ncharge distribution in the two layers. We studied the\nmagneto-transport coefficients of GaAs bilayer hole systems with unequal layer densities. When the interlayer\ntunneling is sufficiently small, \u03c1xx of the bilayer system\nexhibits a pronounced hysteresis at perpendicular magnetic field (B) positions close to where either the majority\nor minority layer is at LL filling factor one. Most remarkable is the time dependence of \u03c1xx at a fixed field in the\nhysteretic regime, when the two layers are closely spaced.\nAs a function of time, \u03c1xx exhibits large, random, sudden\njumps toward higher and lower values, followed by a slow\ndecay in the opposite direction. The data may signal an\ninstability in the charge distribution of the two layers,\ni.e., an instability associated with the pseudospin (layer),\nrather than spin, degree of freedom.\nWe studied nine GaAs bilayer hole samples from six\ndifferent wafers, all grown on GaAs (311)A substrates\nand modulation doped with Si. In all samples, the holes\nare confined to two 15nm-wide GaAs quantum wells\nwhich are separated by AlAs or AlAs/AlGaAs barriers\nwith thickness 7.5 \u2264 W \u2264 200nm. The rather thick barrier combined with the large effective mass of GaAs 2D\nholes [9] reduces considerably the tunneling between the\ntwo layers [10]. As grown, the samples have layer densities of \u2264 7 \u00d7 1010 cm\u22122 , and low temperature (T ) mobilities of \u223c 35 m2 /Vs. Metallic top and bottom gates were\nadded to control the densities in the layers. We studied several types of devices, including 2.5\u00d72.5mm square\n\nsamples and ones with patterned Hall bars; in these samples the ohmic contacts contact both layers. One sample was fabricated using a selective depletion scheme [11]\nthat allows probing the transport characteristics of individual layers. The measurements were performed in a\ndilution refrigerator down to T = 20mK.\nData of Fig. 1 highlight some of the results of our\nstudy. In (a) we show a set of traces where \u03c1xx was measured for a sample with W = 11nm as B was ramped up\nor down. For the traces of Fig. 1(a) the total bilayer density (ptot ) is kept constant at 5.5\u00d71010 cm\u22122 while charge\nis transferred from one layer to another using back- and\nfront-gate biases. We define the charge transfer from one\nlayer to another as \u2206p = (pB \u2212 pT )/2, where pB and pT\nare the densities of bottom and top layers, respectively\n[12]. At a given value of B, we define the filling factor, \u03bd,\nof the bilayer system as the ratio between ptot and the LL\ndegeneracy, eB/h. We also introduce the filling factors\nfor top and bottom layers, \u03bdT and \u03bdB respectively, as the\nratio between the layer density and eB/h.\nThe data of Fig. 1(a) show that when the bilayer\nsystem is balanced (\u2206p=0; top trace) \u03c1xx is independent of the direction B is ramped. However, as soon as\nthe system is imbalanced (|\u2206p| > 0) a strong hysteresis\ndevelops in \u03c1xx . For values of \u2206p < 4.7 \u00d7 109 cm\u22122 ,\n\u03c1xx displays hysteretic behavior in two field ranges near\n\u03bd = 2, one near \u03bdT = 1 and another near \u03bdB = 1. When\n\u2206p \u2265 4.7 \u00d7 109 cm\u22122 , the hysteresis exists only near\n\u03bdB = 1. For sufficiently large \u2206p, no hysteresis is observed. The amplitude of the hysteresis also decreases as\nT is increased (data not shown) and vanishes completely\nabove T \u2243230mK, roughly independent of \u2206p.\nTo probe the contribution of the spin degree of freedom\nto the hysteresis in our bilayer systems, we performed\nmeasurements in tilted magnetic fields on a sample very\nsimilar to the one shown in Fig. 1(a). In this experiment\nthe direction of the field was kept at an angle \u03b8 with respect to the normal to the plane of the bilayer system.\nFor \u03b8 ranging from 0\u25e6 to 80\u25e6 , corresponding to a six-fold\nincrease of the total field (and therefore of the Zeeman\nenergy) in the hysteretic region, the position of the hysteresis in perpendicular magnetic field did not change at\nall. If the hysteresis were caused by an instability associated with the spin degree of freedom, one would expect\n[6, 7] that the applied parallel field would change the po-\n\n\f2\n10\n\nptot=10.8\u00d710 cm\n\n(a)\n\n8 p =5.5\u00d71010 cm-2\ntot\n\n10\n\ncm\n\n-2\n\n1.0\n30mK\n\n0\n0.5\n\n1.6\n\u03bd=2\n\n3.2\n\n6\n\n0.0\n30\n\n(c)\n\ntop layer\n\n5\n4.7\n\n20\n\n4\n\n3\n\n\u03bdT=1\n\n10\n\n\u03bdB=1\n\n\u03bdT=1\n\n\u03bd=1\n\n0\n\n7.9\n\n(d)\n\nbottom layer\n\n1.0\n\n2\n9.5\n\n\u03bdB=1\n\n0.5\n\n1\n9\n\n0\n0.0\n\n\u03c1xx(k\u03a9/o)\n\n7\n\n\u03c1xx(k\u03a9/o)\n\n\u2206p=1.3\u00d710\n\n(b)\n\nbilayer\n\n\u03bd=2\n\n-2\n\n\u2206p=11.1\u00d710 cm\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\nB(T)\n\n2.0\n\n-2\n\n2.5\n\n0.0\n1\n\n2\n\n3\nB(T)\n\nFIG. 1: (a) \u03c1xx vs. B traces for a GaAs bilayer hole sample with a barrier width W = 11nm. Data are shown for different\nvalues of charge transfer, \u2206p, while ptot is kept constant at 5.5 \u00d7 1010 cm\u22122 . The traces are shifted vertically for clarity. The\ndotted lines indicate the positions of bilayer filling factors \u03bd = 2 and \u03bd = 1. A strong hysteresis develops in \u03c1xx when the\nbilayer system is imbalanced. The right and left tick marks in each trace indicate the estimated positions of filling factor one\nfor layers with higher (bottom) and lower (top) densities, respectively. The right panel shows data for a similar sample but\nwith independent layer contacts, and ptot = 10.8 \u00d7 1010 cm\u22122 and \u2206p = 1.3 \u00d7 1010 cm\u22122 . (b) \u03c1xx vs. B traces measured when\nthe ohmic contacts are connected to both layers. (c) and (d) \u03c1xx of the top and bottom layers measured individually. In all\nfigures the black (red) line represents the trace taken when B is swept up (down).\n\nsition and magnitude of the hysteresis. These results rule\nout spin as being responsible for the hysteresis.\nTo better understand the origin of the observed hysteresis, we fabricated another sample from a different\nwafer, also with W = 11nm, using a selective depletion\nscheme [11], and aimed to independently probe each layer\nof the bilayer system. The data are shown in the right\npanel of Fig. 1. In (b) we plot \u03c1xx for the bilayer system,\nthat is, when the ohmic contacts are connected to both\nlayers, for both up and down B-sweeps. In (c) and (d)\nwe show \u03c1xx traces for the top and bottom layers, measured separately, but at the same pair of layer densities\nas in panel (b) traces. Two features of these data are\nnoteworthy. First, the traces of (b) exhibit hysteresis in\ntwo ranges of B. The hysteresis between 1.45 and 1.8T\nmatches well the position of \u03bdT = 1 QH state of the top\nlayer as seen in (c), while the hysteresis located between\n2.5 and 3.2T overlaps the QH state of the bottom layer\n(see (d)). This observation confirms that the hysteresis\nin \u03c1xx of the bilayer system takes place when one of the\nlayers is at filling factor one. Second, data of (c) and (d)\nshow that each individual layer exhibits hysteresis when\nthe other layer is at filling factor one, i.e., \u03c1xx of the top\n\nlayer exhibits hysteresis when \u03bdB = 1, and vise versa.\nThe observation of hysteretic magneto-resistance in\nunbalanced bilayer systems has precedence. Zhu et al.\n[13] reported hysteresis in 2D electron systems with a\nparallel conducting layer. In their case, the parallel layer\nwas a parasitic, low-mobility, doping layer at a distance\nof 75 to 95 nm away from the high-mobility 2D electrons.\nSimilar to our data, they observed hysteresis in \u03c1xx when\nthe layer containing the high-mobility 2D electrons was\nin a QH state. They also presented a simple model to\nexplain the observed hysteresis. In their model, the hysteresis comes about because of a non-equilibrium charge\ndistribution in the layers. As B is swept, thanks to the\nLandau quantization, the Fermi levels of both layers oscillate. These oscillations lead to temporary imbalances\nbetween the chemical potentials of the two layers. The\npotential imbalance is particularly abrupt and large when\nthe high-mobility 2D electrons enter a QH state as their\nFermi level jumps by a significant amount, equal to the\nseparation between the adjacent LLs. With increasing\ntime, of course, the Fermi levels of the two layers have\nto come to equilibrium since the latter are shorted together via the ohmic contacts.

As a result, \u03c1xx , which is recorded\nas B is swept at a finite rate, can show a hysteretic behavior. Consistent with their model, Zhu et al. found\nthat when the B-sweep is interrupted in the hysteretic\nregion and \u03c1xx is monitored as a function of time, it decays approximately exponentially toward an equilibrium\nvalue. Moreover, they found the time constant of the decay in reasonable agreement with estimates based on the\nparameters of their experiment.\nThe hysteresis in our samples resembles what Zhu et\nal. observe and likely has a similar origin. Our data of\nFig. 1 in fact explicitly show that the hysteresis happens when one of the layers is in a QH state, and it is\nthe resistivity of the layer which is not in the QH state\nthat is hysteretic. The interpretation that the hysteresis\nindicates a charge transfer between the two layers is also\n\nFIG. 3: Time evolution of \u03c1xx in the hysteretic region for\nsamples with different W , ptot , and \u2206p, as indicated. The\ninsets show \u03c1xx vs. B for up- and down-sweeps. The arrow in\neach inset indicates the position at which the time evolution\nwas recorded after an up-sweep of B.\n\nsupported by our data: the hysteresis observed in \u03c1xx of\neither the top or the bottom layer measured separately\nappears much like a horizontal shift of the trace in B, as\nif the layer had slightly different density when ramping\nB up or down [see, e.g., Fig. 1(c)]. The time evolution\nof \u03c1xx in our samples, however, is qualitatively different from the observations of Zhu et al., and points to a\nvery unusual relaxation. In the remainder of the paper,\nwe describe this evolution and speculate on its possible\norigin.\nWe have studied a number of samples with varying ptot ,\n\u2206p, and barrier width 7.5 \u2264 W \u2264 200nm. Samples with\nW = 7.5nm do not show any hysteresis; this is likely\n\n\f4\nbecause the interlayer tunneling is sufficiently large so\nthat the two layers stay in equilibrium during the Bsweep. We observe hysteresis for all samples with 11 \u2264\nW \u2264 200nm, but the time evolution of \u03c1xx critically\ndepends on W . Examples are shown in Figs. 2 and 3. For\nsamples with W = 11nm (Fig. 2), the time evolution is\nsimply wild! It displays sudden jumps in \u03c1xx , followed by\na slow relaxation after each jump. Note that \u03c1xx jumps\ntoward both higher and lower values, reminiscent of a\nbistability, although the jumps do not happen between\nfixed values of \u03c1xx . In between jumps, \u03c1xx follows a slow\nrelaxation, in the opposite direction of the jump, that\ncan be fitted well by a double exponential [see Fig. 2(b)\ninset]. It is noteworthy that even when measured over\ndays (up to 2.5\u00d7105s), we did not observe any tendency\ntowards a settling of the jumps. We wish to emphasize\nthat, outside the hysteretic region, \u03c1xx is independent of\ntime to within less than 0.3%.\nWe have attempted to quantify the characteristics of\nthis evolution by two parameters: average frequency and\namplitude of the jumps. Our T -dependence measurements show that, at a fixed B, the average jump amplitude decreases as T increases. Not surprisingly, the\njumps are no longer visible above the temperature where\nthe hysteresis vanishes. On the other hand, the average frequency appears to be independent of T . Also, the\njump frequency and amplitude are independent of the\nmagnitude of the sample current, as long as the current\nis kept sufficiently small (\u2264 10 nA) [14]. Interestingly,\nthe jumps and decays appear to continue even when the\ncurrent is completely turned off [15].\nThe sample with W = 30nm shows a behavior qualitatively similar to the one with W = 11nm, although\nboth the frequency and size of \u03c1xx jumps are smaller\n[Fig. 3(a)]. Data for the W = 50nm sample, however,\nare qualitatively different [(Fig. 3(b)]: there are by far\nfewer \u03c1xx jumps (typically one jump every few 103 s),\nand \u03c1xx appears to decay with time. Finally, for the\nW = 200nm sample [Fig. 3(c)], we typically observe a\n\nsimple decay with time [16]. Interestingly, for the samples of Figs. 3(b) and (c), \u03c1xx continues to decay with\nan ever increasing time constant.\nThe time evolutions we observe for the sample with\nW = 200nm barrier [Figs. 3(c)] is qualitatively similar\nto the observation of Zhu et al. [13]. The time dependences for the samples with barrier widths W = 11 and\n30nm, however, are very unusual and cannot be understood in a simple model where the bilayer system slowly\nand steadily relaxes to an equilibrium state. In these\nsamples, \u03c1xx displays sudden jumps that do not have any\ntendency to settle, at least over a time scale of days. We\ndo not know the origin of these time evolutions. The sudden jumps in \u03c1xx in our bilayers with small W bear some\nresemblance to the so-called Barkhausen jumps, which\nare observed in magnetic materials [1]. The Barkhausen\njumps occur when the magnetic system finds a lower energy state available and one or several domains change\norientation. A tantalizing speculation is that in the bilayer systems with close layer separation, the interlayer\ninteraction acts as an opposing force to the charge transfer caused by the Fermi level difference [17] . In this\nscenario, the two opposing mechanisms may mediate the\ncreation of a complicated layer charge density pattern or\npseudospin domains.\nAnother possibility is that the observed jumps are not\nintrinsic to the sample, but rather triggered by external\nsources (e.g. electromagnetic noise). If so, it is a puzzle\nwhy the jumps are much more frequent in the bilayer\nsamples with smaller layer separation and are seen only\nin the hysteretic region.\nIn summary we report an unusual time dependence\nassociated with hysteretic magneto-resistance in GaAs\nbilayer holes with close layer separation. The resisitivity\nexhibits sudden jumps with time, possibly caused by a\nlayer charge instability.\nWe thank DOE and NSF for support and D. Haldane\nfor helpful discussions.\n\n[1] G.

If the\noff period is short (\u2264 1 minute), \u03c1xx typically follows the\nsame decay as before the current was turned off. For long\noff periods, \u03c1xx attains a value that is much different than\nbefore, suggesting the occurrence of a jump even when\nthe current was turned off.\n[16] Even the W = 200nm sample shows \u03c1xx jumps, but these\nare extremely rare. We measured four traces like in Fig.\n3(c), taken over a total period of 5 \u00d7 104 s.
