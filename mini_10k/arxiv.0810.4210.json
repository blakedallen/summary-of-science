These conclusions were arrived at by examining the requirements on the mechanical driving\npower from LASCO data, and by deriving reasonable upper and lower limits on the magnetic\nfield carried by the CMEs. This work addressed\nthe overall energetics of the problem without going into the details of how the magnetic energy is\nutilized in driving the CME.\nWe re-examine the flux-rope CME sample considered by SV07. This is the definitive sample\nof flux rope CMEs observed by the LASCO instrument between 1996 and 2001, prepared after\ncareful inspection of the data in order to confirm\ntheir flux rope morphology. Furthermore, SV07\nhave chosen CMEs that retain a clear flux rope\nmorphology throughout their propagation in the\nLASCO C2 and C3 fields of view. This means\n\nIntroduction\n\nAlthough it is well known that the dynamics of\nmagnetic fields in the solar corona control most\nkey aspects of its physical state, there are only\na few known estimates of currents therein. They\nrange from currents in solar prominences inferred\nfrom their dynamics (e.g., Ballester & Kleczek\n1984), indirect estimates of currents in flaring\nloops (e.g., Zaitsev et al 1998; Tan et al 2006)\nand estimates of currents inferred from differential\nFaraday rotation measures of background sources\nobserved against the corona (Spangler 2007). The\nFaraday rotation technique has been used to infer\nthe magnetic field direction in CMEs (Liu et al\n2007) but the magnitude of the magnetic field (or\nthe associated currents) cannot be determined. In\nthis work, we demonstrate a new method of estimating coronal currents; specifically, the driving\ncurrents enclosed by flux rope CMEs. To the best\nof our knowledge, this is the first direct estimate\nof the current enclosed by CMEs in the LASCO\n1 p.subramanian@iiserpune.ac.in\n\n1\n\n\fLorentz forces between the current I~ carried by\nthe flux rope CME and external magnetic fields\n~ \u221e . The fourth term arises from the gravitational\nB\npull of the sun on the CME, where \u03c1 is the matter density inside the CME and a is the distance of\nits center of mass from the sun center. One salient\nfeature of terms 2 and 4 is the fact that they are\nboth proportional to the cross-sectional area of the\nCME. SV07 have established that the mechanical force acting on the CME is independent of its\ncross-sectional area. This result, which was one of\nthe salient ones in SV07, is certainly valid for the\nsubset of the SV07 sample we study here, and is\nprobably of more general validity. With regard to\nthe present study, this implies that terms 2 and 4\non the RHS of Eq 1 (which are proportional to the\nCME cross-sectional area) are unimportant, and\ncan be neglected. It is also well known that the\n~ \u221e ) decrease rather rapidly with\nexternal fields (B\ndistance, especially above strong field regions such\nas active regions. For instance, Kliem & T\u00f6r\u00f6k\n(2006) have shown that the torus instability, which\nis one means of accelerating a flux rope CME in\nits initial stages, is operational only if the external\nmagnetic field falls off faster than R\u22123/2 , where R\nis the distance from the sun center. The external field will certainly be negligible at distances as\nlarge as 2 R\u2299 , which is the starting radius for our\nobservations. This means that the third term on\nthe RHS of Eq 1 can be neglected as well, and it is\nonly the first term that is important. We therefore\nconfine our attention only to this term from now\non.\nThe expression for the Lorentz self-force (the\nfirst term on the RHS of Eq 1) was given by\nShafranov (1966), and has since been extensively\nused by several authors (e.g., Anzer 1978; Garren\n& Chen 1994; Chen 1996; Kumar & Rust 1996;\nTitov & D\u00e9moulin 1999; Isenberg & Forbes 2007).\nSeveral of these papers use only the Lorentz selfforce term owing to an implicit recognition that it\nis by far the most relevant one, and some of them\nneglect the rest of the terms in Eq 1 in order to\nadopt a largely analytical treatment. We, on the\nother hand, have clearly demonstrated our rationale in neglecting all the terms save for the one\non the Lorentz self-force, especially for the sample\nwe have chosen. In this term, the quantity I0 is\nthe axial current, c is the speed of light, a is the\nmajor radius of curvature of the curved poloidal\n\nthat these CMEs largely remain in the plane of the\nsky through the duration of these observations and\nprojection effects (which are sensitive functions of\nthe inclination from the plane of the sky; e.g.,\nVourlidas & Howard 2006) can be considered to\nbe minimal. Of the full flux rope CME sample, we\nconsider only the CMEs in group A of SV07; the\nones whose mechanical (i.e., kinetic + potential)\nenergy increases with time in the LASCO C2 and\nC3 fields of view. This means that these CMEs\nexperience a driving force in this height range. In\nother words, we use the best sample of driven, flux\nrope CMEs in this paper.\n2.\n2.1.\n\nProcedure and Results\nForces on the CME loop\n\nThe outward force f per unit length on the flux\nrope (in cgs units) is given by\n\u0014 \u0012 \u0013\n\u0015\n\u0001\n8a\nli\n3\nI02\n~ P\u221e +\nln\n+ \u03c0 r02 \u2207\n+ \u2212\nf= 2\nc a\nr0\n2\n2\n~ \u221e \u2212 \u03c0 \u03c1 r02 G M\u2299 , (1)\nI~ \u00d7 B\na2\nThis expression is similar to the one employed\nby Yeh (1995), and includes all the possible forces\non the flux rope. The first term on the right\nhand side (RHS) is the Lorentz self-force; this\nwas not included in Yeh's (1995) treatment, for\nhe was concentrating on a regime where the curvature of the flux rope was negligibly small. Physically, the Lorentz self-force can be understood as\nfollows: consider a section of a current-carrying\ntube of cross-sectional radius r0 , where the current flows axially, generating a toroidal magnetic\nfield. When this tube is bent into a circular section of radius a, one can envisage the toroidal field\nlines \"bunching up\" at the bottom of the tube and\ngetting sparse on the top. This means that magnetic pressure associated with the toroidal field\nlines will be greater at the bottom than at the top.\nThis gradient in pressure results in an outwardly\ndirected force on the bent tube (e.g., Mouschovias\n& Poland 1978). We will discuss this term in further detail shortly. The second term expresses the\neffect of buoyancy owing to the gradient of the\nambient pressure (P\u221e ) that drives the solar wind,\nand \u03c0r02 represents the cross sectional area of the\nCME. The third term on the RHS is due to the\n2\n\n\fflux tube and r0 is its minor radius. The quantity\nli is of order unity, and denotes the internal inductance per unit length. It depends upon the\ngeometry of current distribution inside the flux\nrope. For the sake of concreteness, we assume\nthe flux-rope to be characterized by a constant \u03b1,\nforce-free Lundquist solution in cylindrical geometry (Lundquist 1950; Burlaga et al 1981; DeVore\n2000)\nB = 0,\n\u0012 r \u0013\nr\nB\u03c6 = \u03c3H B0 J1 \u03b10\n,\nr0\n\u0013\n\u0012\nr\n,\nBz = B0 J0 \u03b10\nr0\n\nof the CME cross-section (which is envisaged to be\nthe cross-section of a magnetic flux rope) at each\ntimestamp. Among other quantities, we measure\nthe position of the center of mass of the flux rope\nat each timestamp and the number of pixels enclosed by the flux rope cross-section. We take a to\nbe equal to the height of the CME center of mass.\nThe total number of pixels enclosed by the CME\ncross-section gives its area; we derive the quantity\nr0 from this area by assuming the cross-section to\nbe circular.\nFor each CME in group A of SV07, we compute\nthe driving power by fitting a straight line to the\nplots of mechanical energy vs. time. An example\nof an event where the CME is clearly driven (i.e.,\nthe mechanical energy increases as a function of\ntime) is shown in figure 1.\nThe slope of the straight line fitted to such a\nplot gives the driving power PD . The driving force\nFD is then computed by dividing the driving power\nby the velocity of the CME center of mass. The\ndriving force FD is equated to the total Lorentz\nforce\nFL = \u03c0a f ,\n(5)\n\n(2)\n\nwhere B0 is signed, axial field of the flux rope,\n\u03c3H = \u00b11 selects the appropriate handedness near\nthe axis, r0 is the flux rope radius, Jn is the Bessel\nfunction of the first kind of order n and \u03b10 is a dimensionless parameter determined by the boundary conditions. Placing the outer boundary of the\nflux rope at the first zero-crossing of the function\nJ0 yields \u03b10 = 2.4 (DeVore 2000). The internal\ninductance per unit length (li ) is given by\nR r0\nr B\u03c62 (r)dr\nli = 2 0 2 2\n.\n(3)\nr0 B\u03c6 (r0 )\n\nwhere f is given by Eq 4. The factor \u03c0 a implies\na length of \u03c0 radians for the curved portion of the\nflux rope into the plane of the sky.\nSince the driving force FD is derived from a linear fit to the mechanical energy vs. time profile,\nwe have a single number for this quantity for each\nCME we have considered in our sample. On the\nother hand, we have information for the quantities a and r0 for each timestamp for a given CME.\nUpon equating FL at each timestamp to FD , the\nonly unknown quantity is the axial current I0 . For\na given CME in our sample, we therefore obtain a\nvalue for the axial current I for each timestamp.\nExamples for some of the CMEs in our sample\nare shown in figure 2. There is very little variation in the computed driving current I0 with time.\nThe small variations observed are due to changes\nin the quantities a and r0 , which might well be\ndue to projection effects. As mentioned earlier,\nwe have selected CMEs that retain a clear flux\nrope morphology throughout the field of view, and\nthe projection effects are therefore expected to be\nsmall. The most meaningful way of proceeding is\nto compute the average value of the current hI0 i\nfrom plots such as those shown in figure 2. The\n\nUsing Eq 2 in Eq 3, we obtain li = 1.\nUsing these arguments, the force per unit\nlength on the curved portion of the flux rope can\nbe written as\n\u0014 \u0012 \u0013\n\u0015\nI02\n8a\nf =\nln\n\u22121 .\na c2\nr0\n\n(4)\n\nIt may be noted that this expression is strictly\ncorrect only if the torus is slender; i.e., if the ratio\nwithin the logarithm 8a/r0 \u226b 1 (Landau, Lifshitz\n& Pitaevskii 1984); the relative error is of the order\nof [ln(8a/r0 )]\u22121 . The average value for the ratio\n8a/r0 is & 20 for the events we consider (column\n3, table 1).\n2.2.\n\nCalculating the axial current\n\nThe procedure adopted in deriving the mass images and the mechanical energy for each timestamp for a given CME is described in Vourlidas et\nal (2000) and SV07. We circumscribe the extent\n3\n\n\fFig. 1.- Mechanical (i.e., kinetic + potential) energy (in units of 1030 ergs) as a function of time for the\nflux rope CME of 2000/03/22\n\nFig. 2.- Inferred driving current I0 for some of the flux rope CMEs in our sample. + 2000/03/22, *\n2000/06/08, \u2738 2000/07/23, \u25b3 2000/08/02, \u2737 2000/08/03\n\n4\n\n\fresults for all the CMEs in group A of SV07 (i.e.,\nthe ones that are clearly driven) are shown in table\n1. Evidently, the axial current for the CMEs we\nhave studied here is around a few \u00d71010 Amperes.\n3.\n\n\u03c6 = 1.4 B0 r02 ,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere the quantity B0 is defined in Eq 2 and r0\nis the radius of the flux rope as defined in \u00a7 2.2.\nWe relate the axial current I0 to B0 using\n\nDiscussion\n\nA few caveats are in order; the Lorentz selfforce acts only on the topmost, curved part of\nthe flux rope CME. Our calculations cannot distinguish between a flux rope that is completely\ndetached from the solar surface and one that is\nline-tied and distending outwards in the manner of\nan aneurism (e.g., Isenberg & Forbes 2007). The\nonly quantity of interest (in this regard) that enters our calculation is the curved extent of the flux\nrope; we have uniformly assumed it to be \u03c0 radians (Eq 5). It should also be kept in mind that\nthe fact that we are appealing to a Lorentz selfforce means that the flux rope is not force-free.\nIn fact, the manner in which the expression for\nthe Lorentz self-force is derived makes no appeal\nto misaligned currents and magnetic fields; it is\ncalculated using the spatial gradient of the selfinductance of the flux rope. However, the fluxrope can be almost force-free; the axial current\nonly need be slightly misaligned in order for the\nLorentz self-force to be effective (Kumar & Rust\n1996). Furthermore, we have not accounted for\ndrag forces (e.g., Chen 1996). By equating the\nobservationally determined driving force only to\nthe Lorentz self-force (and neglecting drag forces),\nwe are overestimating the Lorentz self-force, and\nthe axial current we compute is therefore an upper\nlimit.\nHaving estimated the axial current, a useful\nquantity to estimate is the magnetic flux \u03c6 carried by these CMEs. It is related to their helicity,\nwhich some authors believe is a crucial determinant of their capacity to erupt (e.g., Low 1996;\nRust 2001; Nindos et al 2003; Kusano et al 2004).\nHowever, there are others (e.g., Phillips, MacNiece\n& Antiochos 2005) who argue that there need not\nbe a critical helicity buildup for CMEs to erupt.\nFurthermore, the magnetic flux is a quantity that\nis more easily defined. We therefore estimate it at\nthe first timestamp for each of the CMEs in our\nsample, using Eq (52) of DeVore (2000), which we\nreproduce below:\n\nB\u03c6 (r = r0 ) =\n\n2I0\ncr0\n\n(7)\n\nUsing Eqs 2, 7 and 6, we get\n\u03c6=\n\n2.8I0 r0\n\u03c3H cJ1 (\u03b10 )\n\n(8)\n\nThe quantity \u03c6 for each of the CMEs we have\nstudied is quoted in column 5 of Table 1. We note\nthat \u03c6 is generally a few times 1021 Mx. This compares well with the generally quoted value of 1021\nMx for the average flux carried by near-earth magnetic clouds (e.g., Lepping, Jones & Burlaga 1990;\nDeVore 2000). Since we are invoking dissipation\nof magnetic flux via Lorentz self-forces in order to\nexplain the driving force on CMEs, it is understandable that the flux carried by a typical CME\ntowards the start of its journey is somewhat larger\nthan what it carries when it reaches the earth in\nthe form of a magnetic cloud.\n4.\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have computed upper limits on the axial\ncurrents enclosed by flux-rope CMEs. Our method\nrelies on measurements of the driving power for\nthese CMEs using a well established method using\nLASCO data. We assume that the driving force\nis entirely due to Lorentz self-forces in the bent\ntorus comprising the flux rope. We have chosen\na sample of flux rope CMEs that clearly experience a driving force in the LASCO field of view.\nWe find that the average driving current for each\nof the CMEs in our sample is a few \u00d71010 Amperes. This figure is about an order of magnitude lower than estimates of currents carried by\nfilaments (e.g., Ballester & Kleckzek 1984). Estimates of currents in active region flaring loops\nrange from 1010 \u20131012 Amperes (e.g., Zaitsev et al\n1998; Tan et al 2006). On the other hand, using a method that involves measuring the polarization of radio sources observed against the solar corona, Spangler (2007) has estimated coronal\ncurrents ranging from 108 \u2013109 Amperes. It may\n5\n\n\fTable 1: Average driving current enclosed by CMEs\nDate\nTime 8a/r0 hI0 i/(1010 Amp)\n97/11/01 20:11\n21\n1\n97/11/16 23:27a\n19\n1\n98/02/04 17:02\n18\n2\n98/02/24 07:28\n26\n0.5\n98/05/07 11:05\n22\n2\n98/06/02 08:08\n14\n3\n99/07/02 17:30\n14\n1\n99/08/02 22:26\n26\n1\n00/03/22 04:06\n18\n2\n00/05/05 07:26\n23\n1\n00/05/29 04:30\n20\n1\n00/06/06 04:54\n21\n1\n00/06/08 17:07\n13\n1\n00/07/23 17:30\n16\n1\n00/08/02 17:54\n14\n2\n00/08/03 08:30\n15\n2\n00/09/27 00:50\n15\n1\n00/10/26 00:50\n17\n1\n00/11/12 09:06\n22\n1\n00/11/14 16:06\n19\n1\n00/11/17 04:06\n20\n1\n00/11/17 06:30\n18\n1\n01/01/07 04:06\n14\n1\n01/01/19 17:06\n18\n1\n01/02/10 23:06a\n11\n2\n01/03/01 04:06\n14\n1\n01/03/23 12:06\n15\n2\na\n\n\u03c6/(1021 Mx)\n2\n10\n6\n2\n7\n10\n7\n4\n6\n2\n5\n5\n3\n4\n5\n5\n4.2\n4\n11\n1\n2\n3\n3\n5\n19\n2\n5\n\nThe time refers to the previous day.\nColumn 1: Date on which a given CME occurred; Column 2: Start time in the C2 field of view;\nColumn 3: The quantity a/r0 (Eq 1); Column 4: Average driving current in units of 1010 Amperes;\nColumn 5: Magnetic flux at starting timestamp in units of 1021 Mx.\n\n6\n\n\ffew \u00d71010 Amperes) for the asymptotic value of\nthe drive current in such a model, thereby fixing\nthe normalization.\nWe plan to extend our measurements to CME\nobservations from the SECCHI coronagraphs\naboard the STEREO mission. These observations\ncan provide a much better estimate of the threedimensional extent of a CME and will improve the\naccuracy of our current estimates.\n\nbe emphasized, however, that Spangler's measurement pertained to the current enclosed in an Amperian loop in the quiescent solar corona, and had\nnothing to do with CMEs or their driving currents. As mentioned in \u00a7 1, the only attempt to\napply the Faraday rotation technique to CMEs has\nsucceeded only in determining the magnetic field\norientation, and not its magnitude.\nWe also note that we obtain values of a few\n\u00d71021 Mx for the flux carried by the CMEs at\nthe first timestamp (i.e., towards the beginning\nof their journey). This value is a factor of a few\nlarger than the generally quoted average value of\n1021 Mx for the flux carried by an average nearearth magnetic cloud. The excess flux is presumably dissipated (via Lorentz self-forces) in powering the CME during its journey from the sun to\nthe earth. This fits in very well with our overall picture of CME energetics (Vourlidas et al\n2000; SV07). Given the completely different data\nsources used to estimate the flux carried by nearearth magnetic clouds (Lepping, Jones & Burlaga\n1990; DeVore 2000) and that carried by flux rope\nCMEs (this work), this level of agreement is remarkable, and lends strong support to our overall\nhypothesis.\nFinally, we comment on the utility of our results in the light of the numerous analytical and\nnumerical attempts at describing CME energetics. Our approach has been to concentrate on\nevents for which there is clear evidence of driving\npower. Furthermore, the driving power for these\nevents is reasonably constant in the field of view,\nas evident from the largely linear shape of the mechanical energy vs time plots. As explained in\n\u00a7 2.2, this results in a single number for the driving force, and consequently the driving current,\nthroughout the field of view. In some sense, our\nresults should be compared with the regime in the\nsimulations which show evidence for a constant\ndriving current. The most appropriate example\nwe could find was Figure 4 of Isenberg & Forbes\n(2007). The semi-analytical model described there\npredicts a significant range where the driving current approaches a constant value. However, it may\nbe noted that such models (as well as simulations)\ncan only predict the shape of the drive current vs\ntime curve, and cannot assign a number to the\nnormalization. Our results are complementary in\nthe sense that they provide a definite number (a\n\n5.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe thank the anonymous referee for a critical\nappraisal of our work that has helped us significantly improve this paper.\nREFERENCES\nAnzer, U. 1978, Solar Phys., 57, 111\nBallester, J.
