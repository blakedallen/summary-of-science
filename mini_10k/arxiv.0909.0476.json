Every knot can be embedded in a genus g Heegaard surface in S 3 . For\nexample, the torus knots can be embedded in a genus 1 Heegaard surface in\nS 3 . In this paper, we will focus on knots that can be embedded in the genus 2\nHeegaard surface in S 3 . In [6] and [7], Hill and Murasugi studied such knots,\nwhich they called double-torus knots. Two subclasses of the double-torus knots\nare the primitive/primitive knots and the primitive/Seifert knots, which arise\nin the study of exceptional Dehn surgery.\nA theorem of Thurston tells us that at most finitely many surgeries on a\nhyperbolic knot are non-hyperbolic. Since these non-hyperbolic surgeries are\nuncommon, we refer to them as exceptional surgeries. In [1], Berge introduced\nthe primitive/primitive knots and observed that they have lens space surgeries.\nLater Dean ([2], [3]) introduced the primitive/Seifert knots, a natural generalization of primitive/primitive knots, and noted that surgery on such a knot at\nthe surface slope is either a Seifert fibered space or a connected sum of lens\nspaces. In [10], Miyazaki and Motegi showed that the primitive/Seifert knots\nare mostly hyperbolic. Since Seifert fibered surgeries on hyperbolic knots are\ndifficult to understand, the primitive/Seifert knots are particularly interesting\nto study.\nA natural question is that of uniqueness: can a knot have more than one\nprimitive/Seifert representative with the same surface slope? Here, in section\n3, we give examples of a two-parameter infinite family of knots with distinct\n\n1\n\n\fprimitive/Seifert embeddings. We also ask a similar question: can a knot have\ntwo representatives, one primitive/Seifert and one primitive/primitive, with the\nsame surface slope? In section 4, we discuss a family of torus knots that have\nthis property. All the necessary definitions are found in section 2.\nThe author would like to thank her thesis advisor, Cameron Gordon, for\nmany valuable conversations and suggestions, as well as his patience and encouragement.

This is done by\nidentifying \u2202D2 \u00d7 I with an annulus neighborhood of K in F , a process called\n2-handle addition. The 2-handle addition may result in several types of spaces.\nWe name two of them here.\nDefinition K is called primitive with respect to H if adding a 2-handle to H\nalong K yields a solid torus.\nDefinition K is called Seifert with respect to H if adding a 2-handle to H along\nK yields a Seifert fibered space.\nIf K is Seifert, a lemma of Dean [3] and Eudave-Mu\u00f1oz [4] tells us which\nSeifert fibered spaces occur.\nLemma 2.1 If K is Seifert with respect to H, then the manifold obtained by\nadding a 2-handle to H along K is Seifert fibered over the disk with at most two\nexceptional fibers with multiplicities a1 and a2 or over the M\u00f6bius band with at\nmost one exceptional fiber of multiplicity b. In the first case, K is primitive if\nand only if a1 or a2 is 1.\nIn this paper, we will only consider knots that are Seifert over the disk. If K\nis Seifert with respect to H over the disk with exceptional fibers of multiplicity\na1 and a2 , we say K is (a1 , a2 ) Seifert fibered over D2 or simply (a1 , a2 ) Seifert.\nNow consider H to be a genus 2 handlebody in the Heegaard decomposition\nof S 3 and call the other handlebody H 0 . Then F = \u2202H = \u2202H 0 and K is a\nsimple closed curve in the genus 2 Heegaard surface F of S 3 . Primitive and\nSeifert with respect to H 0 are defined in the same way as for H, so we can\ndefine primitive/Seifert as follows.\nDefinition The curve K is called primitive/Seifert with respect to F if it is\nprimitive with respect to H and Seifert, but not primitive, with respect to H 0 .\nUp to now, we have considered curves on the genus 2 Heegaard surface F of\nS 3 , but we can also think of these curves as knots in S 3 . Since 2-handle addition\nalong K on H and H 0 yields either two solid tori or a Seifert fibered space and\na solid torus, we can describe the manifolds obtained by surgery on the knot at\nthe surface slope with respect to F [3] [4], defined here.\n2\n\n\fDefinition Let N denote a tubular neighborhood of K in S 3 . The surface slope\nof K with respect to F is the isotopy class of \u2202N \u2229 F in \u2202N .\nProposition 2.2 If a knot K in S 3 is primitive/Seifert with respect to the\ngenus 2 Heegaard surface F , then Dehn surgery on K at the surface slope yields\none of the following:\na. A Seifert fibered space of the form S 2 (a1 , a2 , a3 )\nb. A Seifert fibered space of the form RP2 (b1 , b2 )\nc. A connected sum of two lens spaces\n\n2.2\n\nTwisted Torus Knots\n\nLet T (p, q) denote the (p, q)-torus knot. We obtain from T (p, q) the twisted\ntorus knot K (p, q, r, n) by twisting r strands of T (p, q) n times. This new knot\ncan be viewed as a curve on a genus 2 Heegaard surface in S 3 , which one can\nsee in the following way.\n\n1111\n0000\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n\n1111\n0000\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n\nD'\n\nD\n\nFigure 1: K (5, \u22123, 2, \u22121)\n\nLet D be a disk on the torus so that T (p, q) intersects D in r disjoint arcs,\nwhere 0 \u2264 r \u2264 p + q. We also consider a disk D0 on the torus in which r parallel\ncopies of T (1, n), denoted rT (1, n), lie so that D0 intersects rT (1, n) in r disjoint\narcs, one in each component of rT (1, n). Then we excise the disks D and D0\nfrom their respective tori and glue the two tori together along the boundary of\nthe disks so that the orientations of the two torus links align correctly. Figure\n1 shows the example K (5, \u22123, 2, \u22121).\nNote that if r = 0, the twisted torus knot K (p, q, 0, n) lies on the torus\nso that the disk D is disjoint from the (p, q)-torus knot, so that the knot only\nintersects one of the two punctured tori whose union is F .\nProposition 2.3 (Dean) The surface slope of K (p, q, r, n) is pq + nr2 .\nFrom Proposition 2.2, when a twisted torus knot is primitive/Seifert, pq+nr2\nsurgery will result in one of the types of manifolds listed there. It remains to\ndiscuss which twisted torus knots are primitive/Seifert.\n\n3\n\n\f2.3\n\nPrimitive and Seifert Twisted Torus Knots\n\nBy considering the word for K in \u03c01 (H) and the algebraic definitions of primitive and Seifert, Dean showed the following [3].\nProposition 2.4 For any integer k with 1 \u2264 k <\n(k, p \u2212 kq) Seifert fibered over D2 .\n\np\nq,\n\nK (p, q, p \u2212 kq, n) is\n\nTheorem 2.5 K is primitive with respect to H if and only if one of the following conditions holds:\na. p = 1\nb. r \u2261 \u00b11 or \u00b1q mod p.\nWe can modify these statements slightly when we want to consider H 0 rather\nthan H. For example, the (p, q)-torus knot part of the twisted torus knot is a\n(q, p)-torus knot on the boundary of H 0 . Then the requirement p = 1 in Theorem\n2.5 becomes q = 1 when we replace H with H 0 in that theorem.\nThese statements lead to criteria on the parameters p, q, r and n for twisted\ntorus knots to be primitive/Seifert. By finding a regular fiber of the Seifert\nfibered space that results from 2-handle addition along K and using homological\narguments, Dean found the Seifert fibered space that results from pq + nr2\nsurgery on K [3].\nTheorem 2.6 The twisted torus knots K (p, q, r, n), with r < max{p, q} and\nn = \u00b11, that are Seifert with respect to H and primitive with respect to H 0\nare K (p, q, p \u2212 kq, n) with 1 < q < p2 and 2 \u2264 k \u2264 p\u22122\nq . Furthermore,\nsurgery at the surface slope for these knots yield Seifert fibered spaces of the\nform S 2 (k, p \u2212 kq, p \u2212 (k \u2212 n) q).\nFrom this theorem, we see that the curves K (17, 5, 2, \u22121) and K (18, 5, 3, \u22121)\nhave the same surface slope with respect to the genus 2 Heegaard surface in S 3 ,\nnamely 81. They also yield the same Seifert fibered space after surgery at the\nsurface slope: S 2 (2, 3, 5). (It is enough here to give the multiplicities of the\nexceptional fibers because we know the surgery slope, and hence the homology\nof the space.) On the other hand, Proposition 2.4 shows that K (17, 5, 2, \u22121)\nis (2, 5) Seifert fibered over D2 with respect to H, whereas K (18, 5, 3, \u22121) is\n(3, 5) Seifert fibered over D2 with respect to H. This tells us that there is no\nhomeomorphism of S 3 that preserves the Heegaard splitting and sends one curve\nto the other. It is natural to ask whether these curves are the same as knots in\nS 3 . In this case, they are isotopic in S 3 , which we can see using conjugacy of\nelements in the braid group. This example provides insight for a more general\nstatement.\n\n3\n\nDistinct Primitive/Seifert Embeddings\n\nTheorem 3.1 Let the curves K1 and K2 in the\u0001 genus 2 Heegaard surface F be\n\u0001\nq\u22121\nq+1\nq+1\nthe twisted torus knots K kq + q\u22121\n2 , q, 2 , \u22121 and K kq + 2 , q, 2 , \u22121 ,\nrespectively, where q \u2265 5 is odd and k \u2265 2. Then K1 and K2 are isotopic as\nknots in S 3 and have the same surface slope with respect to F , but there is no\nhomeomorphism of S 3 sending the pair (F, K1 ) to (F, K2 ).\n4\n\n\fq+1\nq\u22121\nHere we consider r to be q\u22121\n2 , so that 2 is r + 1, and p to be kq + 2 ,\nso that kq + q+1\n2 is p + 1. In particular, we can express the parameters of the\nfamily either in terms of q and k or in terms of p and r, with p and r being\ndependent on q and k. For notational ease, we will mostly use p and r.\nWe think of the knots as closures of braids with q strands, so we will carry out\ncalculations in the braid group Bq . We know that the (p, q)-torus knot can be\np\nrepresented as a braid by (\u03c3q\u22121 \u03c3q\u22122 * * * \u03c31 ) . Since the twisted torus knots are\nobtained from the torus knot by twisting r strands n times, we can represent\nthe\n\u0001\np\n\u22121 r\ntwisted torus knot K (p, q, r, \u22121) by (\u03c3q\u22121 \u03c3q\u22122 * * * \u03c31 ) \u03c31\u22121 \u03c32\u22121 * * * \u03c3r\u22121\nin Bq .\n\u0001\np\n\u22121 r\nIf we can find an element b \u2208 Bq for which (\u03c3q\u22121 \u03c3q\u22122 * * * \u03c31 ) \u03c31\u22121 \u03c32\u22121 * * * \u03c3r\u22121\n\u0001r+1\np+1\nb are equal, then the knots\nand b\u22121 (\u03c3q\u22121 \u03c3q\u22122 * * * \u03c31 )\n\u03c31\u22121 \u03c32\u22121 * * * \u03c3r\u22121\n\u0001\n\u0001\nq\u22121\nq+1\nq+1\n,\nq,\n,\n\u22121\nand\nK\nkq\n+\n,\nq,\n,\n\u22121\nare isotopic in S 3 .

Because K1 and K2 are both Seifert\nwith respect to H and primitive with respect to H 0 , a homeomorphism h of S 3\nwith h (F, K1 ) = (F, K2 ) would have to send H to itself. Then h must extend\nto a homeomorphism of the two Seifert fibered spaces, H[K1 ] and H[K2 ], which\nis impossible. Hence no such homeomorphism exists. We have shown that the\ntwo braids \u03b21 and \u03b22 are conjugate, so their closures, K1 and K2 , are isotopic\nin S 3 .\n\u0003\n\n4\n\nPrimitive/primitive and primitive/Seifert representatives\n\nIn this section, we describe a family of torus knots that have a primitive/primitive\nand a primitive/Seifert representative with the same surface slope. The primitive/Seifert representatives of this family of torus knots arises from the twisted\ntorus knot construction, so this family of knots can be viewed as a family of\ntwisted torus knots that are actually torus knots. From [8], we know that the\nonly integral surgery slopes on the torus knot T (p, q) that yield lens spaces are\npq \u00b1 1. Surgery at the surface slope on a primitive/primitive representative of\na knot yields a lens space [1]. Hence, if a (p, q) torus knot is to have a primitive/primitive representative, it must lie on the genus 2 surface with surface\nslope pq \u00b1 1. In particular, T (p, q) can be considered to be a twisted torus knot\nof the type K(p, q, 1, \u00b11), which is primitive/primitive and has surface slope\npq \u00b1 1.\nConsider the torus knot K1 = T (kq + 1, q) = K(kq + 1, q, 1, \u22121), and the\ntwisted torus knot K2 = K((k + 1)q \u2212 1, q, q \u2212 1, \u22121) where q \u2265 3 and k \u2265 2.\nEach of these knots has surface slope kq 2 + q \u2212 1. K1 is primitive/primitive with\nrespect to F and has a lens space surgery at the surface slope. K2 is of the form\nin Theorem 2.6, so H[K2 ] \u223c\n= D2 (k, q \u2212 1), and kq 2 + q + 1 surgery on K2 yields\na lens space which has the Seifert fibering S 2 (k, q \u2212 1, \u22121). These observations\nlead to the following result.\nTheorem 4.1 K1 and K2 are isotopic as knots in S 3 and have the same surface\nslope with respect to F , but there is no homeomorphism of S 3 sending (F, K1 )\nto (F, K2 ).\nProof To show the knots are isotopic in S 3 , we express K1 as the indicated\nsurgery on the link shown in Figure 2, where the q vertical strands will be closed\nto form a knot, and K2 as the indicated surgery on the link shown in Figure\n3. In each figure, a box with either 1 or -1 appears, as in Figure 4(a). Figure\n4(b) shows what is meant if a 1 appears in this box; in the braid, the right-most\nstrand passes over all of the other strands once, in order. If a -1 appears, the\nbraid will be a reflection of Figure 4(b), i.e. the left-most strand will pass under\nall of the other strands once, in order. We will show that the knots shown in\nFigures 2 and 3 are in fact the same.\n8\n\n\fFigure 2: T (p, q)\n\nFigure 3: K((k + 1)q \u2212 1, q, q \u2212 1, \u22121)\n\n...\n\n...\n\n1\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 4: Twist box\n\n9\n\n\fFirst reconsider the link for K2 to be as shown in Figure 5, where a component has been added, but the indicated surgeries will result in the same knot.\n\nFigure 5: K((k + 1)q \u2212 1, q, q \u2212 1, \u22121)\n\nIt is easy to see that the portion of K2 shown in Figure 6 can be rewritten\nas the braid shown in Figure 7, and replacing that portion of K2 appropriately,\nwe obtain the link shown in Figure 8, which is a reflection of T (p, q), as shown\nin Figure 2.\n\n\u22121\n\n...\n1\n\nFigure 6: Part of K2\n\n1\n\n...\n\u22121\n\nFigure 7: Part of K2\n\n10\n\n\fFigure 8: K((k + 1)q \u2212 1, q, q \u2212 1, \u22121)\nHence, as braids, the vertical strand portions of the links in Figures 2 and\n3 are conjugate by a half twist. As mentioned above, both of K1 and K2\nhave surface slope kq 2 + q + 1. Then the indicated link surgeries represent the\nsame knot, i.e. K1 and K2 are isotopic as knots in S 3 . To show there is no\nhomeomorphism of S 3 sending (F, K1 ) to (F, K2 ), we note that K2 is (k, q \u2212 1)\nSeifert with respect to H. Since k \u2265 2 and q \u2212 1 \u2265 2, H[K2 ] \u223c\n= D2 (k, q \u2212 1).\nOn the other hand, K1 is primitive with respect to both H and H 0 . Since a\nhomeomorphism h : S 3 \u2192 S 3 sending (F, K1 ) to (F, K2 ) will send H to either\nH or H 0 , no such homeomorphism can exist.\n\u0003\n\nReferences\n[1] J.
