The stability of thin liquid coatings is of fundamental interest in everyday life. Homogeneous and non-volatile liquid coatings may dewet either by heterogeneous nucleation, thermal nucleation, or spinodal dewetting. Wetting and dewetting\nis explained on a fundamental level, including a discussion of relevant interactions.\nThe chapter will also address the various dewetting scenarios and explain how the\neffective interface potential governs the behavior obtained for various stratified substrates and film thicknesses.\n\n1 Introduction\n'To wet or not to wet' [1] is the question this chapter tries to answer. It concerns the fundamental aspects of the stability of thin liquid films or coatings.\nThe liquid in question can be any homogeneous liquid3 , such as, e.g., an aqueous solution, an oil, or a polymer melt. Whether or not a liquid wets a given\nsurface is not only of fundamental interest, but also of substantial technical importance. The authors have been approached by numerous companies\nwith interesting problems concerning wettability, ranging from the automotive\nindustry, the pharmaceutical and chemical industry, to the food processing,\nprinting, and textile industry. In principle, the general answer to all wettability problems is simple: a liquid wets a surface if it can gain energy by enlarging\nthe interface with that substrate. To provide this answer for a specific system\nunder study, however, may be quite cumbersome. Below we provide what may\nbe seen as a map to reader to help with a first encounter with thin liquid film\nstability problems. For the sake of clarity, we restrict our considerations to\nliquids on solid, homogeneous substrates.\n\n3\n\nhomogeneous on the length scale set by the thickness of the liquid film under\nconsideration. In particular, demixing or segregation effects are thereby assumed\nto be negligible.\n\n\f2\n\nKarin Jacobs, Ralf Seemann, Stephan Herminghaus\n\n2 Experimental model systems for simple liquids\nIn order to study the basic mechanisms of a certain class of phenomena, it\nis of central importance to identify suitable model systems. Since the main\nproblems in the controlled preparation of thin films and surfaces lies in their\ninherent propensity to become contaminated by dust or other impurities, the\nfirst quantitative studies of surface forces in wetting films have been performed\nwith cryogenic systems, in which impurities are naturally frozen out [2, 3, 4].\nHowever, it has been realized that these systems involve strong exchange of\nmaterial between the liquid and vapor phase and thus are not well suited\nfor studies of dynamic aspects, such as dewetting and structure formation\nphenomena.\nThin laser-annealed metal films were candidates,[5, 6] yet the same time,\ntechniques of preparing systems which involve more complex liquids, such as\npolymer melts, in a well-defined and clean way became progressively available.\nAs a result, the numerous benchmark studies of the basic mechanisms of\ndewetting have been performed with polymer melts (see e.g. the review articles\nof D.G. Bucknall[7] and P. M\u00fcller-Buschbaum[8]). Systematic experimental\nstudies were begun somewhen around the 1990s [9, 10, 11, 12, 13] inspired\nby P.-G. de Gennes' theoretical work.[15, 14] Polymer melts are on the one\nhand close to application (coatings, photo resist), yet on the other hand easily\ncontrollable in the experiments. Polymers such as polystyrene (PS) are very\nsuitable model liquids since they have a very low vapor pressure in the melt,\nand mass conservation can safely be assumed. Moreover, they are chemically\ninert, non-polar, and their dynamics can be tailored by choosing different\nchain lengths and annealing temperatures. For molecular weights below the\nentanglement length (\u223c17 kg/mol), the melt can safely be treated as simple\n(Newtonian) liquid for the low shear rates in dewetting experiments[16, 17].\nBelow the glass transition temperature Tg , the films are glassy and can be\nstored for subsequent analysis4 . PS in atactic steric configuration moreover\ndoes not exhibit any tendency for crystallization.\nAs substrates, typically hydrophobized Si wafers with their natural amorphous Si dioxide layer (SiOx) have been widely used. the present chapter thus\nconcentrates on Si wafers as substrates, which can be purchased with a very\nsmall surface roughness (rms roughness smaller than 0.2 nm). The wettability of these substrates can be tuned by chemically grafting monomolecular\nfunctional layers onto the native silicon oxide overlayer. For instance, hydrophobization is often achieved by grafting a self-assembled monolayer of\noctadecyl-trichlorosilane[25, 26] onto the wafer.\nFor dewetting experiments it is necessary to prepare a thin liquid film in\na non-equilibrium state on a substrate. Usually, a thin polymer coating is\nprepared from a solvent solution by one of the following standard techniques:\n4\n\nIt is important to note that Tg of thin films can be substantially different (mostly\nlower) than the bulk value.[18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]\n\n\fStability and dewetting of thin liquid films\n\n3\n\nspin coating, dip coating, or spraying5 . The solvent evaporates during the\npreparation procedure, leaving behind a smooth, glassy polymer layer. By spin\ncoating a solution of polystyrene in toluene one can easily achieve a PS layer\nof thickness in the range of a few nanometers up to several micrometers. The\nroughness of the polystyrene layer is then similar to the underlying substrate.\nFor experimental details and caveats of preparation, the reader is referred\nto the pertinent literature. [27, 13, 28, 10, 29, 16, 30] The thickness of the\nfilms can be determined by standard techniques, such as ellipsometry[31]. The\ndewetting process can be studied by optical microscopy and/or atomic force\nmicroscopy (AFM). Most studies use AFM in non-contact mode operation to\navoid any damage of the soft surface, which even allows to image the dewetting\nscenario in situ[32, 33].\nTo induce dewetting, the films are heated above the glass transition temperature. Figure 1 shows a series of optical micrographs of an 80 nm thick\nPS film of molecular weight of 65 kg/mol ('PS(65k)') dewetting a silanized Si\nwafer. The series depicts a pattern formation process that is typical for most\ndewetting films, whether for a water film on a waxed surface, or a coating on\na dusty substrate.\n\nFig. 1. Pictures series taken by a light microscope: a 80 nm thick polystyrene film\nof 65 kg/mol molecular weight is dewetting at 135\u25e6 C from a hydrophobized silicon\nsubstrate for approximately (from left to right) 2 min, 10 min, 30 min, and 100 min.\n\nThe process of dewetting can be divided into three stages: in the early\nstage, holes are generated by a rupture process, c.f. Fig. 1a; in the intermediate\nstage, the radius of the holes increases, leading to hole coalescence, c.f. Fig. 1bc. In the intermediate stage, the focus is on the dynamics involved in the\ndewetting process, its impact on the hole profiles and on its influence on\ndewetting patterns. From the dynamics of hole growth [27, 36, 34, 35, 37, 28,\n38, 39, 40] as well as from the shape of the liquid rim surrounding the hole\none can get information about the slip or no-slip boundary condition of the\nliquid close to the solid substrate [17, 41, 42]. In the late stage, the straight\n5\n\nFor all these techniques, the surface to be coated must be wettable by the polymer\nsolution. Otherwise, the film must be prepared on another substrate, e.g. mica,\nand then transferred to the surface of interest.\n\n\f4\n\nKarin Jacobs, Ralf Seemann, Stephan Herminghaus\n\nribbons that separate two coalescing holes decay into droplets due to the\nRayleigh-Plateau instability[43], c.f. Fig. 1c-d. Slight differences in the size of\nthe droplets cause slight pressure differences, leading small droplets to shrink\nand large droplets to grow (Ostwald ripening[44]). Due to the small vapor\npressure and the low mobility of the polymer molecules, the ripening process is\nextremely slow. Most experiments are stopped before the 'final state', i.e. one\nsingle drop on the surface, is reached. In what follows, we focus on the initial\nstage of dewetting: why does the polystyrene film dewet the hydrophobized\nSi wafer at all? The next section will be dedicated to the discussion of the\nvarious energy contributions involved, and their mutual balance.\n\n3 The energy balance\nIn a Teflon c coated frying pan a stable oil layer can only be achieved if\none pours enough oil into the pan. Gravity then stabilizes the thick oil film.\nIf the oil film thins well below the so-called capillary length \u03bbcap , capillary\n(intermolecular) forces dominate over gravitational\np forces and the film may\ndewet [45]. The capillary length is given by \u03bbcap = \u03c3lv /\u03c1g (for olive oil: \u03bbcap \u2248\n1.7 mm, for water: \u03bbcap \u2248 2.7 mm), where \u03c3lv is the liquid/vapor surface\ntension and \u03c1 the density of the liquid. Therefore, dewetting of liquid films\ndriven by intermolecular forces can only occur for 'thin' films, i.e. films thinner\nthan \u03bbcap .\nA liquid can be metastable and then needs a nucleus to induce dewetting.\nIn the following we will focus on liquid films thinner than \u03bbcap and discuss under which conditions a thin liquid layer will be stable, metastable or unstable\non top of a substrate.\n3.1 The Young equation\nDewetting is a dynamic process that begins in a non-equilibrium situation\n[46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 14, 51, 52], namely the flat film on the surface and ends\nwhen reaching an equilibrium state, one droplet or a set of droplets 6 . Thus,\nlet us first start with a droplet, c.f. Fig. 2:\nA droplet on a homogeneous surface usually exhibits the form of a spherical\ncap and the tangent to the droplet at the three phase contact line includes an\nangle \u03b8 with the substrate. In equilibrium, the angle is given by a balance of\nmacroscopic forces:\n\u03c3sv \u2212 \u03c3sl\ncos \u03b8 =\n(1)\n\u03c3lv\nThis is the Young equation [46] of 1805, where \u03c3sv and \u03c3sl are the solid/vapor\nand solid/liquid interfacial energies, and \u03c3lv is the liquid/vapor interfacial\nenergy (or tension).\n6\n\nEquilibrium situation actually is one single droplet, yet it normally takes too long\nto reach this state. Before, a network of droplets is formed.\n\n\fStability and dewetting of thin liquid films\n\n5\n\nq slv\nssl ssv\ncomplete wetting\n\npartial wetting\n\nnonwetting\n\nFig. 2. Sketch of a liquid drop atop of a solid substrate. Complete wetting is characterized by a contact angle \u03b8 = 0, partial wetting by 0 < \u03b8 < \u03c0, and nonwetting\nby \u03b8 = \u03c0 (from left to right)\n\nFor \u03b8 = 0\u25e6 , i.e. \u03c3sv \u2212 \u03c3sl \u2265 \u03c3lv the droplet will spread and will completely\nwet the substrate. For 0\u25e6 < \u03b8 < 180\u25e6 one speaks of partial wetting, and for\n\u03b8 = 180\u25e6 of non-wetting. All three cases are sketched in Fig. 2. In case of water\n(resp. oil), a surface is termed 'hydrophilic' ('oleophilic') if 0\u25e6 \u2264 \u03b8 < 90\u25e6 and\n'hydrophobic' ('oleophobic') for 90\u25e6 \u2264 \u03b8 \u2264 180\u25e6 7 . In other words, the contact\nangle in Young's equation is determined by the free energies of interfaces\nbetween semi-infinite media.\nThis is, however, not the full story. Although a first glance at Fig. 2\nsuggests that the free energy of a homogeneous film should be written as\n\u03c3film = \u03c3sl + \u03c3lv , this approach neglects possible interactions of the two interfaces (solid/liquid and liquid/vapor) with each other, across the liquid film.\nSuch interactions may come up by virtue of van der Waals forces between the\ninvolved materials, which may span several tens of nanometers. In the vicinity\nof the three phase contact line, the interfaces can thus deviate significantly\nfrom a straight intersection at Young's angle (cf. Fig. 3). We will come back\nto this point later, after having discussed in some detail the long-range forces\nof a stratified system.\nThese forces are of similar importance for predicting the stability of a liquid film. Their dependence on film thickness determines not only the linear\nstability against small perturbations of the free surface, but also the scenario\nby which the initially uniform film is transformed into its equilibrium state,\nwhich consists of droplets of contact angle \u03b8 on the surface [53, 54, 55]. For\nexample, a droplet of photo resist on a semiconductor may exhibit an equilibrium contact angle \u03b8 = 20\u25e6 and therefore wets the surface only partially. What\ndoes this mean for a photo resist film that was prepared by a non-equilibrium\ntechnique (spin coating) on top of the semiconductor? According to Young's\nequation, the film is not stable. How will the film decay into droplets and at\nwhat speed will this process take place at a given temperature? Will there be\ntime to dry or cure the photo resist before it dewets?\nDepending on the thickness of the photo resist, the answers will be different, though Young's contact angle \u03b8 is always the same! Macroscopic and\n7\n\nIt should be noted that non-wetting has never been observed on flat surfaces,\nalthough some systems (like, e.g., mercury on glass) come quite close.\n\n\fa)\n\n9\n\nb)\n\nq\n\nq\n\n9\n\n6\n\n6\n\n3\n\n3\n\nheq\n\n0\n0\n\nheq\n\nheq\n\n30\n\n60\n\n90\n\n0\n\nlateral distance [nm]\n\nheight [nm]\n\nKarin Jacobs, Ralf Seemann, Stephan Herminghaus\n\nheight [nm]\n\n6\n\n0\n30\n\n60\n\n90\n\nlateral distance [nm]\n\nFig. 3.

In what follows, we shall discuss which forces are to be considered, and what typical length scales are involved.\n3.2 The effective interface potential\nFollowing the preceding section, we define the so-called effective interface potential \u03c6(h) \u2261 \u03c3sl + \u03c3lv \u2212 \u03c3film . It comprises both short-range and long-range\ninteractions and is defined as the excess free energy per unit area which is\nnecessary to bring two interfaces from infinity to a certain distance. From its\nvery definition, it is clear that \u03c6(h) \u2192 0 as h tends to infinity. The excess free\nenergy of an infinitely thick film is thus given by the sum of the free energies\nof its two interfaces, in accordance with intuition.\nFor dielectric systems, there are only two relevant types of interactions,\nsteric repulsion and van der Waals forces8 .\n\u03c6(h) = \u03c6(h)steric + \u03c6(h)vdW\n\n(2)\n\nIn Fig. 4 three typical curves of \u03c6(h) are sketched to illustrate the general\nprinciple. Line (1) characterizes a film that is stable on the substrate, since\nenergy would be necessary to thin the film. The equilibrium film thickness is\ninfinite. The two other curves exhibit a global minimum of \u03c6(h) at h = heq :\nCurve (2) characterizes a film that is unstable, whereas line (3) describes a\nmetastable film.\n8\n\nA detailed description for numerous different situations involving e.g. polar\nmolecules or hydrogen-bonds or the interactions of a colloidal sphere interacting with a metallic surface can be found in the textbook of J. Israelachvili[48].\n\n\feff. interf. potential F\n\nStability and dewetting of thin liquid films\n\n7\n\n(1)\n(3)\n(2)\n\nF(heq)\nheq\n\nfilm thickness h\n\nFig. 4. Sketch of the effective interface potential \u03c6 as a function of film thickness. Line (1) denotes the stable case, line (2) the unstable one and curve (3) the\nmetastable case. The thickness of the stable wetting layer is termed h = heq , and is\ntypically in the order of some nm, the depth of the global minimum of \u03c6 is named\n\u03c6(heq ).\n\nIt is readily shown by a linear stability analysis [56, 57, 58] that if the\nsecond derivative of \u03c6(h) with respect to h is negative (\u03c6\u2032\u2032 (h) < 0), unstable modes exist whose amplitudes grow exponentially according to exp(t/\u03c4 ),\nwhere \u03c4 is the growth time that is characteristic for the respective mode. Furthermore, there is a characteristic wavelength \u03bbs of these modes the amplitude\nof which grows fastest and will therefore dominate the emerging dewetting\npattern.\nThe linear stability analysis also reveals that the spinodal wavelength \u03bbs\nis linked to the (second derivative of the) effective interface potential [56, 57]:\ns\n\u22128\u03c0 2 \u03c3lv\n.\n(3)\n\u03bbs (h) =\n\u03c6\u2032\u2032 (h)\nThe spinodal wavelength \u03bbs is the key to clearly identify a spinodal dewetting\nprocess in experimental systems.9\nOne question is now to be answered: What links the effective interface potential to Young's contact angle? The effective interface potential can describe\na non-equilibrium situation, yet Young's contact angle is only defined for the\nequilibrium. A. Frumkin has published in 1938 that[60]\n\u03c6(heq )\n= cos \u03b8 \u2212 1 .\n\u03c3lv\n9\n\n(4)\n\nThe name 'spinodal dewetting' has been coined due to the analogy to spinodal\ndecomposition of a blend of incompatible liquids, which occurs if the second\nderivative of the free energy with respect to the composition is negative[59]. As\nin dewetting, this mechanism is clearly distinct from heterogeneous nucleation,\nin which randomly distributed impurities dominate the emerging pattern. [13]\n\n\f8\n\nKarin Jacobs, Ralf Seemann, Stephan Herminghaus\n\nWhat is the consequence of Eq. (3) and Eq. (4)? Determining the spinodal\nwavelength \u03bbs as a function of film thickness h enables us to gain insight into\nthe course of \u03c6\u2032\u2032 (h). By additionally measuring the equilibrium layer thickness\nheq and the contact angle \u03b8, it is possible to reconstruct the complete effective\ninterface potential,[29, 30, 6] c.f. Fig. 7, as will be shown later.\nThe steric and the van der Waals part of the effective interface potential\nare characterized by different exponents and different interaction constants,\ntherefore we will discuss the interactions separately:\nSteric repulsion and chemical interactions are relevant only within a few\n\u00c5ngstroms of film thickness, and the resulting force is therefore termed 'shortrange force'. The repulsion is due to overlapping electron shells and is typically\ndescribed by a higher-order polynomial function and varies as 1/h12 , where\nh is the distance between the interacting bodies and is difficult to quantify.\nConsidering two planar surfaces, this repulsion yields an interaction energy\nvarying as\nC\n(5)\n\u03c6(h)steric = 8 ,\nh\nwhere C is a constant characterizing the interaction strength10 . The reason\nfor the lower exponent in the flat film geometry lies in fact that mutual interaction between all involved atoms or molecules have to be considered. For\nan extended derivation of the equations we like to refer to J. Israelachvili's\napproach11.\nVan der Waals interactions characterize attractive intermolecular\nforces of quantum-electrodynamic origin. They arise from the variations of\nthe zero-point energies of the collective electromagnetic modes of the system\nunder study. The van der Waals energy between two molecules turns out to\nvary as 1/h6 in the non-retarded approximation. This approximation holds\nas long as the lateral dimensions of the system are much smaller than the\nwavelength of the electromagnetic fields at the dominant excitation energies.\nConsidering retardation effects, the interaction falls off as 1/h7 . In the following, we use only non-retarded potentials since in the experimental systems,\neffects due to retardation are mostly camouflaged by experimental error bars.\nNevertheless, in some special cases including cryogenic systems, retardation\neffects have been reported [2] and a recent theoretical study [61] discusses their\npossible influence on thin films in the context of the full theory of Dzyaloshinskii, Lifshitz, and Pitaevskii [62].\nConsidering again two planar surfaces, the non-retarded interaction yields\n[48, 63]\nA\n\u03c6(h)vdW = \u2212\n,\n(6)\n12\u03c0h2\n10\n\n11\n\nThis definition of \u03c6(h)steric here is such that C is positive and thus the interaction\nalways repulsive.\nHere, chapter 10 in the textbook of J. Israelachvili [48] is very helpful.\n\n\fStability and dewetting of thin liquid films\n\n9\n\nwhere A is the Hamaker constant[64] and \u03c6(h) is the energy per unit area. A\nretarded interaction is described as \u03c6(h) \u223c A/h3 .\nThe van der Waals forces of two media interacting through vacuum are\nalways attractive, and A is positive. If the vacuum yet is replaced by a third\nmedium (e.g. a liquid film), things get more involved: In a system consisting\nof three media m1 /m3 /m2 , it may happen that m1 attracts m2 stronger than\nm3 attracts m2 . Thus m2 is 'repelled' by m3 , this means that the Hamaker\nconstant is negative. To describe the entire system, the Lifshitz theory[65] has\nto be applied. Here, the interacting bodies are treated as continuous media\nand the atomic structure is ignored [65, 48, 62]. Rather, bulk properties as\nthe dielectric constants and the refractive indices are used to calculate the\nHamaker constant.\nFor the sake of completeness, we cite here the formula 12 for the Hamaker\nconstants from the book of J. Israelachvili[48], which has proven to be very\nuseful. It is valid for two media 1 and 2, interacting through media 3. All media\nare taken as being dielectric with a single electronic absorption frequency \u03bde ,\nwhich is typically in the range of 3 * 1015 Hz; n is the refractive index of the\nmedium in the visible and \u01eb the dielectric constant (i.e. n2i = \u01ebi , taken in the\nvisible spectral range)\nA = A\u03bd=0 + A\u03bd>0\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n3\n\u01eb2 \u2212 \u01eb3\n\u01eb1 \u2212 \u01eb3\n\u2248 kT\n4\n\u01eb1 + \u01eb3\n\u01eb2 + \u01eb3\n(n21 \u2212 n23 )(n22 \u2212 n23 )\n3h\u03bde\np\np\np\n+ \u221a p\n8 2 (n21 + n23 ) (n22 + n23 ){ (n21 + n23 ) + (n22 + n23 )}\n\n(7)\n(8)\n(9)\n\nThe Hamaker constant A will then give the strength of the van der Waals\nforces between the two interfaces solid/liquid and liquid/air.\nFor air as medium 1, Si as medium 2 and polystyrene as medium 3, Eq. 9\ngives13 ASi = \u22122.2(5) * 10\u221219 J, replacing Si as medium 2 by silicon dioxide,\nthe Hamaker constant is ASiOx = 1.8(4) * 10\u221220 J. For a silane (OTS) covered\nSi wafer, the Hamaker constant for the interaction with PS is calculated to\nbe AOT S = 1.9(3) * 10\u221220 J. For A < 0 (A > 0), the system can gain energy\nby enlarging (reducing) the distance h between the surfaces, in other words,\na polystyrene film of thickness h is stable on Si, since A < 0.\nIn Fig. 5, the dotted line represents the van der Waals potential, \u03c6(h)vdW ,\nas given by Eq. 6 for a polystyrene film on a Si wafer, where ASi is negative.\nThe potential therefore is positive, purely repulsive 14 and the PS film will be\n12\n13\n\n14\n\nConfer chapter 11, Eq. 11.13 of Ref.[48]\nThe error of the Hamaker constant is a result of the uncertainties of the optical\nproperties of the involved materials as found in literature.

Long-range part of the effective interface potential \u03c6(h) as function of PS\nfilm thickness h for different SiOx layer thickness ranging from 0 nm (dotted line)\nto infinity (solid line), calculated with the formula given in Eq. (10). The Hamaker\nconstants were calculated from the optical constants of the involved materials[48].\n\nDue to the 1/h2 dependence of the potential, the van der Waals forces are\nlong-range forces and act significantly on distances up to about 100 nm. In\nstratified systems with more than one layer between the two half spaces of\nmedia 1 and 2, all mutual interactions have to be considered. The exact calculation of the van der Waals potential may therefore be quite cumbersome. This\nis an important point, since there is a number of publications that disregard\nthis aspect and claim that theory and experiment do not match. A system like\na PS film in air, spun on a thin silicon oxide layer on top of a Si wafer involves\ntwo thin layers (three interfaces, abbreviated as air/PS/SiOx/Si) and can be\ndescribed by two Hamaker constants. So far, no discrepancies between theory and experiment have ever been observed when the formulas given above\nhad been used. One on the most impressive successes is the quite accurate\nprediction of the critical wetting temperature of pentane on water [66].\nAssuming additivity of forces, the system air/PS/SiOx/Si can be characterized by a summation of the van der Waals contributions of each of the\nsingle layers with thickness h of the PS and dSiOx of the SiOx layer:\nair) interacting through a third one, here the liquid layer. Hence attractive and\nrepulsive are meant for air being attracted to the solid surface or 'repelled'. In\ncase it is repelled, the effective interface potential is repulsive for the respective\nthickness of the liquid layer and the liquid wets the solid.\n\n\fStability and dewetting of thin liquid films\n\n\u03c6vdW (h) = \u2212\n\nASiOx \u2212 ASi\nASiOx\n+\n,\n2\n12\u03c0h\n12\u03c0(h + dSiOx )2\n\n11\n\n(10)\n\nwhere ASiOx and ASi are the Hamaker constants of the respective system\nair/PS/SiOx and air/PS/Si. Although not exact,15 the concept allows to calculate the interaction energies even for stratified systems. With the help of\nEqs. (9) and (10), the van der Waals potential of the experimental system is\naccessible, if the SiOx layer thickness is known and the Hamaker constants\nare calculated as shown before. Fig. 5 depicts the van der Waals potential as\ngained from Eq. (10). Clearly, the potential is influenced by the thickness of\nthe silicon dioxide layer.\nSo the widely used system air/PS/OTS/SiOx/Si can be described by\n\u03c6vdW (h) = \u2212\n\nAOT S\nAOT S \u2212 ASiOx\nASiOx \u2212 ASi\n+\n+\n,\n12\u03c0h2\n12\u03c0(h + dOT S )2\n12\u03c0(h + dSiOx + dOT S )2\n\n(11)\n\nyet the long-range potential \u03c6vdW is not much different to a system with an\nSiOx layer of thickness dOT S + dSiOx , since the optical properties of the OTS\nand the SiOx layer are very similar. The difference in wetting behavior will\nonly be obvious if the short-range potential is added.\nTo conclude so far, \u03c6(h) combines short- and long-range interactions.\nShort-range interactions are difficult to quantify, yet van der Waals interactions can be captured by the optical properties of the involved materials,\neven for stratified systems, where the suitable van der Waals potential must\nbe taken. If \u03c6\u2032\u2032 (h) < 0, spinodal dewetting is possible and a characteristic\nwavelength \u03bbs should be imprinted on the dewetting pattern.\n\n4 Experiments: Linking the effective interface potential\nto macroscopic properties\nIn this section experimental results shall be compared to the predictions made\nby the effective interface potential. Typical experimental dewetting patterns\nin the system air/PS/SiOx/Si are shown in Fig. 6. What can we learn from\nanalyzing the dewetting films? I) By AFM, the contact angle \u03b8 of droplets in\nthe late stage of dewetting can be measured. II) The equilibrium film thickness\nheq can be determined, e.g. by ellipsometry.

However, these rules can only achieve\ngood results under severe limitations, e.g., if the zero-frequency contribution A\u03bd=0\nin Eq. (9) is negligible [48]. Strictly speaking, they are plain wrong, and should be\nused, if at all, with utmost care. It is not surprising that many of the studies which\nhave used them could not quantitatively reconcile the theoretical description with\nthe experimental results.\n\n\f12\n\nKarin Jacobs, Ralf Seemann, Stephan Herminghaus\n\nand IV) the growth time \u03c4 of the spinodal pattern can be determined.

Fig. 7a comprises experiments with different PS film thicknesses\non Si wafers with dSiOx = 2.4 nm (open symbols) and with dSiOx = 191\nnm (filled symbols). From the data of \u03bb(h) data points for \u03c6\u2032\u2032 (h) can be\ngained. Now, fitting the second derivative of Eq. (10) to the data, the Hamaker\nconstants and the short-range interaction constants can be obtained as fit\nparameters and the entire effective interface potential can be inferred. It is\nplotted in Fig. 7b.\nThe best fits[29, 30] are achieved for ASi,f it = \u22121.3(6) * 10\u221219 J and\nASiOx,f it = 2.2(4)*10\u221220 J. The values for A nicely match the values calculated\nfrom optical properties of the media involved, as described by Eq. 9. For C\nwe find CSiOx,f it = 6.3(1) * 10\u221276 Jm6 and COT S,f it = 2.1(1) * 10\u221281 Jm6 . In\nthe cited references, a detailed description of the fitting and reconstruction\nprocedure can be found.\nThe second derivative \u03c6\u2032\u2032 (h) is plotted in in Fig. 8a for three SiOx layer\nthicknesses. An arrow marks the zero in the respective second derivative, corresponding to the relevant inflection points of the curves displayed in Fig. 7b.\nSpinodal dewetting is possible only for films thinner than indicated by the\narrows: PS films on Si wafers with an 1.7 nm (2.4 nm) thick oxide layer are\nunstable for PS film thicknesses below 3 nm (4 nm). For larger thicknesses,\nthe films are metastable and need to overcome a potential barrier in order to\nfinally reach the global minimum of \u03c6. The maximum in \u03c6, which is visible\nin Fig. 7b for the broken curves, represents only part of this barrier, since a\nnucleus for dewetting as it is formed, e.g., by thermal activation, is a localized\n\n\fStability and dewetting of thin liquid films\n\nb)\n\n3\n\neff. interf. potential F [mN/m]\n\na)\n\nl [\u03bcm]\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\nfilm thickness [nm]\n\n10\n\n13\n\n0.1\n\n0.0\n\n-0.1\n\nd (SiOx)\n1.7 nm\n2.4 nm\n191 nm\n\n-0.2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\nfilm thickness [nm]\n\nFig. 7. a) Spinodal wavelength as function of PS film thickness on Si wafers with\ndSiOx = 2.4 nm (open symbols) and with dSiOx = 191 nm (filled symbols). b) The\neffective interface potential \u03c6(h) for three different SiOx layer thicknesses.\n\nstructure and thus involves excess surface energy as well [68]. It is readily\nchecked that the energy required to form such nucleus is in almost all cases\nlarge as compared to kT , such that thermal nucleation plays no role in systems of practical interest. This can be illustrated nicely with the PS films,\nas shown in Fig. 8b. PS films on thick 191 nm SiOx (solid line in Fig. 7a)\nare unstable for all relevant film thicknesses. On 2.4 nm of oxide, however,\na sign reversal is observed at a film thickness of about 4 nm (white arrow\nin Fig. 8a). Only very close to this point, the height of the potential barrier vanishes, and homogeneous nucleation by thermal activation is possible\n[68, 45, 69]. However, nucleation can as well, and usually does, proceed by\nmeans of localized defects in the film. A defect, be it in the molecular texture\nof a polymeric film or just a small dust particle, may remove the potential\nbarrier locally and thus induce dewetting. This rupture mechanism is termed\n'heterogeneous nucleation' [59, 67], in analogy to defect-mediated nucleation\nin demixing scenarios.\nThe fact that the effective interface potential can be directly inferred from\nmacroscopic quantities, such as the spinodal wavelength, is one reason why\nexperimentalists are seeking for spinodally dewetting regimes in thin liquid\nfilm systems. However, if a company is asking why their coating does not stay\nstable on a surface, it is convenient to rather have a stability diagram which\nallows to look up where the system will be in a metastable or an unstable state.\nA stability diagram for the system air/PS/SiOx/Si is shown in Fig. 8b. The\nsolid lines of the diagram base on Eq. 2 with a long-range potential as in Eq. 10\nand separate the spinodal dewetting (unstable) regime, where \u03c6\u2032\u2032 (h) < 0,\nfrom in the regime of heterogeneous nucleation, characterized by \u03c6\u2032\u2032 (h) >\n0 (metastable regime). Thermal nucleation is possible for \u03c6\u2032\u2032 (h) = 0, this\nline separates the two regimes.

In fact, it usually dominates if\nthe experiments are not performed in extremely clean conditions.

It can easily be obtained via\nthe optical properties of the involved media and by taking into account the\nadapted van der Waals potential for stratified systems. It is worth noting that\nmetastable potentials can only be present if there is more than one Hamaker\nconstant involved, one with negative and one with positive sign.\nComing back to the company - a stability diagram for their specific system\nwill reveal the way to a solution of their wettability problem: If their coating\nsystem is located in the metastable regime (in the example shown, it depends\non the silicon dioxide thickness and the polystyrene thickness), the advice\nis to reduce the number of possible nucleation centers, e.g. by creating a\ncleaner environment. If the coating system yet is in the unstable regime, the\nintroduction of an adhesion promoter is necessary.\n16\n\nAs explained above, thermal nucleation can be only observed if the nucleation\nbarrier is of order kT . On the scale of Fig. 8b, this is fulfilled only in a region\nsmaller than the width of the line denoted 'thermal nucleation'. Alleged observations of thermal nucleation in a wider range [70] appear very questionable.\n\n\fStability and dewetting of thin liquid films\n\n15\n\nAs mentioned at the beginning, the shape of a droplet close to the three\nphase region is influenced by the long-range intermolecular interactions. By\nAFM, this region can be characterized. For a detailed discussion we like to refer\nto the work of T. Pompe et al.[71, 72]. In Fig. 3 two profiles are sketched that\nwere calculated based on the knowledge of the effective interface potential.\nFig. 3a is a characteristic curve for an unstable potential as shown for dSiOx =\n191 nm in Fig. 7a, whereas a profile like Fig. 3b is expected for a metastable\npotential like for dSiOx = 1.7 nm. The experimental AFM results (not shown\nhere) corroborate the theoretical expectations[73].\nOne question is open up to now: are spinodal dewetting patterns always\nas easy to detect as in Fig. 6a? The answer is 'no': patterns which at first\nglance appear like the one shown in Fig. 6b can be generated due to a spinodal\nprocess as well [6]. The next section we will briefly explain how to distinguish a\ndewetting pattern of a system in the metastable state from one in the unstable\nregime and also address thermal nucleation.\n\n5 Characterizing experimental dewetting patterns\nThe three rupture scenarios spinodal dewetting, homogeneous nucleation, and heterogeneous nucleation give rise to specific dewetting patterns. Vice versa, characterizing the experimental dewetting pattern can help\nto identify the rupture mechanism and to infer the effective interface potential. Fig. 1 and Fig. 6 show experimental examples of films dewetting via\ndifferent rupture mechanisms. Theoretically, the distinction between nucleation and spinodal dewetting appears quite clear: Vrij [56] proposed already\nin 1966 that a spinodal rupture of a free liquid film results in a dewetting\npattern of 'hills and gullies' with a preferred distance \u03bbs after a certain time\nof rupture \u03c4 .\nExperimentally, the rupture time \u03c4 is difficult to measure since the hole\nwhich forms as the film has thinned to zero thickness must have a certain\nsize to be observable. Experimentalists thus concentrated instead on the evidence of a preferred wavelength \u03bbs observable in their systems.17 If, however, the holes are randomly (Poisson) distributed, they are assumed to stem\n17\n\nNote that a preferred hole distance \u03bbs has to be distinguished from a mean hole\ndistance: In some studies it was found that the mean hole distance scaled with the\nfilm thickness as expected for spinodal dewetting [10, 74]. Therefore, the scenario\nshown in Fig. 1a was often regarded as a typical spinodal dewetting scenario.\nHowever, it turned out later that this was not correct:[13] first of all, the system\nis metastable for the film thicknesses studied, as an analysis similar to Eq. 10\nwould have shown. Secondly, the typical time scale for spinodal dewetting does\nnot fit the theoretical expectation (rupture time \u03c4 \u221d h5 ).\n\n\f16\n\nKarin Jacobs, Ralf Seemann, Stephan Herminghaus\n\nfrom heterogeneous nucleation, reflecting the fact that defects typically\nexhibit random statistics. Although it was generally accepted later that (heterogeneous) nucleation from localized defects is the reason for the dewetting\nscenario shown in Fig. 1a, the very nature of the nucleation defect mostly remains unclear: it might be dust particles or any other chemical or physical inhomogeneities. In some holes, by light microscopy or atomic force microscopy\n(AFM), a nanoscopic object could be observed right in the center of each hole.\nAssuming the object to be a dust particle, the first trial was to reduce the\nnumber of nucleation centers by improving the preparation conditions. The\nnumber of holes, however, could not be reduced below a certain level, which\nsuggests that the physics of hole nucleation in polymer films may be deeper\nthan a mere effect of 'dirt'. It has been shown experimentally that stress inside\nthe thin films (stretched entanglements[75]) caused by the preparation of the\nfilm out of solution plays a significant role and can cause holes. Details can\nbe found in the studies of Seemann et al.[73] and Reiter et al. [39] .\nThe experimental distinction between a hole pattern with preferred hole\ndistance and a pattern with randomly distributed hole sites is far from being\nobvious. The thicker the films are, the weaker is the driving force, and the\nlonger is the growth time \u03c4 of the spinodal mode[56, 57, 30] (typically, \u03c4 \u221d h5 )\nand can easily exceed experimental time scales. For thicker films, dewetting\nby heterogeneous nucleation may therefore be quicker and can suppress a\nspinodal pattern [76, 77]. Moreover, chemical heterogeneities can locally cause\na change in \u03c6 and therefore the rupture conditions of the sample may vary\nfrom spot to spot leading to a less-ordered dewetting pattern. This effect is\nmore pronounced in thicker films due to the small driving forces and the large\ngrowth time \u03c4 . Hence a two-point correlation function (a radial pair correlation\nfunction g(r) or a Fourier transform) might not be sensitive enough to detect\nthe correlations between the hole sites, or the statistics is too poor. Then, more\npowerful tools have to be applied. Minkowski functionals - based on integral\ngeometrical methods - have shown to be a versatile method to track down\nhigher order correlations. There is no room here to dwell on this method\nin any reasonable detail. The reader is referred to the pertinent literature\n[78, 6, 13, 79, 32, 33].\nLet us come back to thermal nucleation once more. As discussed above, the\npotential barrier for nucleation of a dry spot may in principle be overcome by\nthermal activation, provided the system is sufficiently close to the sign reversal\nof \u03c6\u2032\u2032 (h). The characteristic feature of this scenario is a continuous breakup\nof more and more holes, whereas nucleation from defects causes holes that\nemerge only within a sharp time window [28]. Fig. 6c depicts an example for\na 4.1 nm thick PS films on a wafer with a 2.4 nm SiOx layer: Holes of different\nsizes are observable. For that system, the stability diagram of Fig. 8 b reads\nthat \u03c6\u2032\u2032 (4.1 nm) \u2248 0, which is another strong indication that the theoretical\npredictions corroborate the experimental observations and are able to capture\nthe wettability of dielectric systems.\n\n\fStability and dewetting of thin liquid films\na)\n\n770 s\n\nb)\n\nc)\n\nd)\ng)\n\n2270 s\n\n4220 s\n\n6500 s\n\n17\n\n1.5 \u03bcm\ne)\n\nf)\n\ng)\n\n3819 s\n\n8 \u03bcm\nFig. 9. Dewetting morphology of a 3.9(2) nm PS(2k) film on a Si wafer with a\n191 nm thick SiOx layer as recorded by in situ AFM. Up to about 5000 s (e) the\ntemperature was held constant at 53\u25e6 and annealing times are given in the pictures.\nAfterwards, the temperature was successively increased to 100\u25e6 . The scan size in\n(a)(d) is 1.5 m. In (e)(g) larger scans were made to check possible damage of the\nsample by the AFM tip. Scan (e) was taken some minutes before scan (d), whereas\nscan (f) was recorded some minutes after scan (d). Scan (g) characterizes the end\nof the dewetting process and Ostwald ripening of the droplets slowly sets in.\n\n6 Dynamics of spinodal dewetting\nAt the beginning of spinodal dewetting studies, only one system was known to\ndewet spinodally: thin gold films on top of quartz substrates [5]. Metal films,\nhowever, are not so easy to deal with as compared to polymer films, since\nthe films need to be annealed by a laser. Hence, the time scale is in the ns\nrange, crystallization plays a role and the Hamaker constants are not so easy\nto calculate. Polymer films such as polystyrene (PS), however, are dielectric\nand Hamaker constants can easily be determined via Eq. 9.\nIn situ AFM studies on a dewetting PS film on a Si wafer with a thick\nSiOx layer reveal the dynamics of the structure formation process, c.f. Fig. 9.\nFig. 10 depicts results of Fourier transforms of the AFM scans. Clearly, one\nmode is amplified fastest. The amplitude of the growing unstable mode, shown\nin the inset, grows exponentially with time, as expected from theory. Further\ninvestigations show that at the onset of the dewetting, no mode is specifically\nselected, rather, the amplitude reflects the roughness of the film. Comparing\nthe results to deterministic simulations,[32] the pattern formation process and\nthe morphology of the dewetting structures match very well, yet the tempo-\n\n\f18\n\nKarin Jacobs, Ralf Seemann, Stephan Herminghaus\n\nral evolution of the morphology slightly differs. It turned out that thermal\nfluctuations accelerate the dewetting dynamics in the experiments.[69, 33]\n\namplitude [nm]\n\n12\n\npower [x 1-2 nm]\n\n10\n8\n6\n\n1\n0.1\n\nT = RT\n\n1E-3\n4\n\ncoalescence of\nholes starts\n\n0.01\n0\n\n1000\n\n2000\n\ntime [s]\n\n2\n0\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nwave vector q [1/\u03bcm]\n\nFig. 10.

Note that the time\nintervals between the curves are not constant. The inset depicts the amplitude of\nthe undulation as a function of annealing time. The first data point at t < 0 s gives\nthe roughness of the PS film surface at room temperature (RT) as revealed from a\nFourier transform. The solid line is a fit of an exponential growth to the data, as\nexpected from theory[57].\n\n7 Conclusion\nThe wettability of a substrate is a delicate interplay of forces. For dielectric\nsystems, the wettability can be described successfully by the effective interface\npotential \u03c6, which is a sum of short- and long-range interactions. The latter\nare dominated by van der Waals interactions. Their strength can be obtained\nby calculating the Hamaker constant via the optical properties of the involved\nmedia. For stratified systems, the additivity of forces can be assumed.\nRupture mechanism, pattern formation, morphology and dynamics of\ndewetting are all governed by the effective interface potential and the experiments can corroborate the theoretical expectations.\nThe knowledge of the effective interface potential therefore allows for a tailoring of the wettability on demand and is a great tool for further fundamental\nor applied studies.\n\nReferences\n1.
