A\nnumber of retinal images from the STARE database (www.parl.clemson.edu/stare) are analyzed,\ncorresponding to both normal and pathological states of the retina. In all studied cases a clearly\nmultifractal behavior is observed, where capacity dimension is always found to be smaller then the\ninformation dimension, which is in turn always smaller then the correlation dimension, all the three\nbeing significantly lower then the DLA (Diffusion Limited Aggregation) fractal dimension. We also\nobserve a tendency of images corresponding to the pathological states of the retina to have lower\ngeneralized dimensions and a shifted spectrum range, in comparison with the normal cases.\nPACS numbers: 05.40.-a, 61.43.Hv, 87.57.-s, 87.57.Nk\n\nOver the past decade, there have been several attempts\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] in the direction of employing the fractal dimension as a measure for quantifying the \"state\" of\nhuman retinal vessel structures (considered as geometrical objects), with the expectation that such analysis may\ncontribute to automatic detection of pathological cases,\nand therefore to computerization of the diagnostic process. While this is certainly a valid question with possibly high impact on real world diagnostic issues, there\nare some issues that should be addressed before such investigations may prove useful for the standard clinical\npractice. First, the fact that retinal vessels represent \"finite size\" realizations of a fractal growth process, imposes\nquestions about how exactly should one go about measuring the fractal dimension of a particular instance (e.g.\nan electronic image of a retinal vessel structure, taken\nfrom a given angle, with a given resolution and lightning conditions). A related question is to what extent\nthese calculations may correspond to the limiting fractal\n(which would have been attained if the growth process\ncould have been extended to infinity), or equivalently, to\nwhat degree they may be compared with calculations on\nother such finite instances. Although various issues related to these questions have already been addressed (for\na current review see e.g. [6]), it seems that many of them\nremain open for further investigation. Second, some of\nthese works [3, 4] address the point that the retinal vessels may have different properties in different regions, and\ndo indeed find different characteristics depending on the\nlocale of measurement, although the procedures adopted\nin these works are only remotely related to established\nconcepts of multifractality, and the corresponding commonly accepted procedures for its measurement (see e.g.\n[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] and references therein).\nIn this work we concentrate on the latter of the above\nissues, that is, we show that the human retinal vessel\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: borko@ufpe.br\n\nstructures are geometrical multifractals, characterized by\na hierarchy of exponents rather then a single fractal dimension. We analyze a number of retinal images from\nthe STARE database [13], corresponding to both normal and pathological states of the retina. In all cases\nwe find clearly multifractal behavior. The capacity (or\nbox counting) dimension is always found to be smaller\nthen the information (or Shannon) dimension, which is\nin turn always smaller then the correlation dimension. In\nall cases the observed values of the capacity dimension\nwere significantly lower then the DLA (Diffusion Limited\nAggregation) fractal dimension, which has been considered in earlier works [1, 2, 6] as the primary model relevant for the phenomenon at hand. It is also found that\nimages corresponding to pathological cases tend to have\nlower generalized dimensions, as well as a shifted spectrum range, in comparison with the normal cases.\nIn contrast to regular fractals (or monofractals), multifractals are characterized by a hierarchy of exponents,\nrather then a single fractal dimension. A well known example of multifractality is the growth probability distribution during the DLA growth process, which has been\nshown to exhibit multifractal scaling [14, 15, 16, 17].\nGeometrical (or mass) multifractals represent a special\ncase when the measure of interest is homogeneously distributed over the observed structure, so that only the\nnumber of particles (Lebesgue measure) contributes to\nthe measure within a given region of the fractal [8, 9].\nConsidering a structure with mass (number of pixels)\nM0 and linear size L, covered with a grid of boxes of\nlinear size l, the generalized dimension Dq for the mass\ndistribution is defined by\nX \u0012 Mi \u0013q\ni\n\nM0\n\n\u0012 \u0013(q\u22121)Dq\nl\n,\n\u223c\nL\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Mi is the mass (number of pixels) within the ith box, and q is a continuous (adjustable) variable that\nmakes it possible to single out fractal properties of the object at different scales (equivalent of inverse temperature\n\n\f2\nin thermodynamics). The generalized dimensions D0 , D1\nand D2 correspond to the capacity (or box-counting) dimension, information (or Shannon) dimension, and correlation dimension, respectively. Finally, D\u2212\u221e and D\u221e\nrepresent the limits of the generalized dimension spectrum (for monofractals, all the generalized dimensions\ncoincide, being equal to the unique fractal dimension).\nIt turns out that the direct application of (1) in practice is hindered by the fact that for q < 0 the boxes\nthat contain a small number of particles (because they\nbarely overlap with the cluster) give anomalously large\ncontribution to the sum on the left hand side of (1). To\nalleviate this problem and perform the multifractal analysis of the retinal vessel structures, we adopt the generalized sand box method [9, 10], which has been successfully used do demonstrate geometric multifractality\nof DLA [9]. This procedure consists in randomly selecting N points belonging to the structure, and counting for\neach such point i the number of pixels Mi (R) that belong\nto the structure, inside boxes of growing linear dimension\nR, centered at the selected pixels. The left hand side of\nequation (1) can now be interpreted as the average of the\nq\u22121\nquantity (Mi (R)/M0 )\naccording to probability distribution Mi (R)/M0 . When the box centers are chosen randomly, the averaging should be made over the chosen set,\nand the equivalent of (1) becomes\n*\u0012\n\u0013q\u22121 + \u0012 \u0013(q\u22121)Dq\nM (R)\nR\n.\n(2)\n\u223c\nM0\nL\nThe practical advantage of this method is that the boxes\nare centered on the structure, so that by construction\nthere are no boxes with too few particles (pixels) inside.\nTo verify whether human retinal vessel structures\ndemonstrate geometrical multifractal scaling properties,\nwe have used a set of forty retinal images from the\nSTARE database [13], manually segmented by two different observers (herefrom referred to by initials AH and\nVK as in [13]) from twenty original retinal scans (containing ten normal and ten pathological cases), for the\npurpose of studies on automatic image segmentation and\ndiagnostics [18]. The images segmented by observers AH\nand VK differ in level of detail, and the resulting set,\ntotaling forty segmented images, is available for download from the STARE project [13] in ppm file format,\nwith resolution of 700x605 pixels. As recently it has been\nargued [19] that fractal analysis may be more sensitive\nto changes in vascular patterns when skeletal images of\nvascular trees are considered, rather then the original\nsegmented images (which contain the vessel width information), in order to verify whether the vessel width\ninformation indeed does exert influence on the multifractal analysis, we have also performed skeletonization of the\ntwo downloaded sets using the eight connected Rosenfeld\nalgorithm [20], to produce two additional sets of twenty\nimages each. A typical normal and a pathological image, segmented by observers AH and VK (where images\nsegmented by observer VK demonstrate a substantially\n\na)\n\nb)\n\nc)\n\nd)\n\ne)\n\nFIG. 1: Image of a typical normal retinal vessel structure\n(image files im0162.ah.ppm from the STARE database [13]),\nsegmented by a) observer AH and b) observer VK, together\nwith their skeletonized versions c) and d), respectively, and a\ntypical pathological structure (image file im0001.ah.ppm, diagnosed with Background Diabetic Retinopathy), segmented\nby observer AH.\n\nhigher level of detail), respectively, together with their\nskeletonized versions using the Rosenfeld algorithm, are\nshown in Fig. 1.\nFor all of the four sets (containing twenty images\neach), we have performed measurements (calculations)\naccording to (2), selecting 1000 random points on each\nstructure (typical structure size M0 is approximately\n30000 pixels, and the typical linear size L is 600 pixels), and counting number Mi of pixels inside boxes centered at selected points. These numbers were then used\nto extract generalized dimension Dq , for different values of q (\u221210 < q < 10), as slopes of the lines obtained\n(minimum squares fitting) of\nE\nD through regression\nq\u22121\n/(q \u2212 1), as a function of log(R/L).\nlog [M (R)/M0 ]\nThe whole procedure was repeated 100 times (with different random choices of the 1000 random points), for\neach image, and for each value of q. The final values of\nDq were calculated as averages over these repetitions.\nA word is due on calculations for the special case\nq = 1, corresponding to information dimension D1 . As\nthe above formulas are non-analytic for q = 1, we perform calculations at q = 1\u00b1\u01eb, for \u01eb = 0.001, and assuming\n\n\f3\n\n2.0\n\nDq\n\n1.9\n\n1.8\n\n1.7\n\n1.6\n\n1.5\n\n1.4\n-10\n\n-5\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\nq\n\nFIG. 2: The generalized dimension spectrum, Dq versus q,\nfor a typical normal retinal image (image file im0162.ah.ppm\n[13]), averaged over 100 random choices of 1000 points each\n(see text for details). The error bars indicate the largest\nand smallest values encountered within the 100 runs, and the\ncurve connecting the points serves as a guide to the eye. The\npoints corresponding to the capacity dimension D0 = 1.647,\nthe information dimension D1 = 1.594 and the correlation dimension D2 = 1.552 are represented by full circles, while the\ndotted lines serve to emphasize their position.\n\nlinearity of the function D(q) in this (short) interval, we\ninterpolate D1 \u2248 (D1\u2212\u01eb + D1+\u01eb ) /2 (in fact, the difference between the values of Dq calculated on both sides\nof q = 1 was found to be only slightly larger then the\nstatistical fluctuations induced by random choice of the\nset of measurement points on the structure).\nResults of a typical calculation are shown in Fig. 2,\nwhere it is seen that the observed retinal vessel structure\nclearly demonstrates multifractal scaling, rather then being a simple monofractal (there is a significant difference between generalized dimensions). In particular, the\ncapacity dimension D0 , the information dimension D1\nand the correlation dimension D2 are all different, satisfying D0 > D1 > D2 . Also, all the three values remain substantially lower then the DLA fractal dimension estimate, commonly accepted in the literature, of\nDq=2 \u2243 1.71 (which is in fact underestimated by commonly used methods) [9], in contrast with previous findings [1, 2, 6].\nNumerical corresonding to Fig. 2 (for the set of twenty\nimages from the STARE database segmented by observer AH) are given in Tab.

While\nthe current set of images is not particularly adequate for\ntesting the effects of a given type of pathology (there\nare only ten normal images, and ten pathological images\naffected by not necessarily the same disease, see [21]), it\nis seen that pathological case images tend to have lower\nmaxima, occasionally more narrow spectrum range, and\na shift in the spectrum position, in comparison with the\nnormal cases.\nFinally, in Fig. 4 we present results of the f (\u03b1) spectrum averaged separately for the normal and the pathological images for all of the four sets, where it is seen\nthat the previous observation holds for both observers,\nindependent of skeletonization.

More precisely, the current work is primarily concerned with establishing the fact that retinal vessel\nimages represent geometrical multifractals, nevertheless,\nour calculations suggest that there may be grounds for\nautomatic differentiating between normal images and certain pathological cases.\nIn conclusion, we show in this work that vascular structures of the human retina represent geometrical multifractals, characterized by a hierarchy of exponents, rather\nthen a single fractal dimension. We analyze twenty retinal images from the STARE database [13], where half of\nthe images correspond to normal states of the retina, and\nhalf to different pathological states [21], together with\ntheir skeletonized versions. In all studied cases we find\nclearly multifractal behavior, with capacity dimension\nconsiderably lower then the DLA value. We also observe\na tendency of normal images of having higher generalized dimensions and a shift of the f (\u03b1) spectrum range\ntowards higher singularity strength values, in comparison\nwith the pathological cases. While the last observations\nare hardly conclusive from a statistical standpoint, they\nmay prove relevant in the quest of automatic diagnostic\nprocedures.\n\n[13] The STructured Analysis of the Retina (STARE)\nproject, www.parl.clemson.edu/stare/probing.
