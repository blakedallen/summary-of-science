This interest stems from the variety of\nprocesses in which the membrane plays a key role, among\nthem cell shaping and movement [1], cell division [2], signal transduction [3], and molecule trafficking [4]. This latter\nprocess is of fundamental value for the regulation of the localization, assembly, and aggregation of molecules within, and in\nthe vicinity of, the plasma membrane, functionalities that are\nall linked to a healthy cell existence [4]. Understanding the\nmotion of membrane-associated molecules is, thus, of direct\ninterest and great relevance.\nRecent observations of lateral movements of molecules on\nthe surface of the cell [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] have led to the suggestion that the moving (transmembrane) molecules are confined within certain regions of the cell membrane. This confinement is ascribed [11] to collisions of membrane molecules\nprotruding into the cytoplasm, the substance that mainly fills\nthe cell interior, with the cytoskeleton [12], a filament-like\nstructure present in the interior of the cell. The collisions are\nexpected to reduce the movements of the molecules and effectively confine their motion on the surface of the cell, as if\nthe plasma membrane were compartmentalized. Within each\ncompartment, the molecules are envisaged as moving freely,\ntheir motion being hampered as they traverse adjacent compartments. As the actin filament that forms the compartment\nboundary dissociates due to thermal fluctuations, a nearby\ntransmolecule with sufficient kinetic energy may overcome\nthe barrier potential and hop to the adjacent compartment.\nThese arguments are the basis of the so-called \"membraneskeleton fence model\" for temporary \"coralling\" of the transmembrane molecules [13]. Further slowing effects are also\npossible due to \"transmembrane-protein pickets\" anchored on\nthe membrane skeleton fence [11], in agreement with the latest research findings [14], suggesting that the lipid bilayer\nplasma membrane is more mosaic than previously thought\n[15]. A recent publication by Morone et al. [16] on imaging the cell surface by using electron tomography techniques\nhas provided further support for these models.\n\nObservations [11, 13, 17] of molecular movements in the\nplasma membrane of various mammalian cell types point to\ncompartment dimensions between 30 and 240 nm and an average hop rate between compartments ranging from 1 to 17 ms.\nWhereas diffusion constants of these molecules are known to\nbe about 10 \u03bcm2 s\u22121 in the absence of compartments, the above\nobservations lead to the extraction of effective diffusion constants 5 to 50 times smaller for the motion associated with\nhops between compartments [11]. These experimental results\nhave been analyzed [11] in the past in terms of the model of\nPowles et al. [18], wherein the molecule is looked upon as\na random walker moving in an infinite 1-D space with periodically arranged semipermeable barriers. The short-coming\nof the theory delineated in ref. [18] is that the space-time dependence of the probability distribution of the random walker\nis obtained in terms of an unwieldy infinite series of terms\nwhich is difficult to handle. Furthermore the mean square displacement, which is the quantity of direct comparison to the\nexperiment [11], is not derivable analytically from ref. [18].\nAgainst this backdrop, which consists of experiments\nexhibiting non-standard (meaning non-free) diffusion of\nmolecules on a cell membrane, and a theory which is not easy\nto validate, use, or manipulate, because of its involved expressions, we present a new analysis for hindered molecular\ndiffusion on cell membranes. It is based on calculations carried out by one of the present authors, but not published, on\nthe formally (but not physically) similar problem of Frenkel\nexciton transport [21] in deuterated molecular crystals. We\nwill see that our theory results in easily usable expressions for\nthe molecular mean square displacement and for the effective\ndiffusion constant. We will show explicitly how to use our expressions by deducing reasonable values for the compartment\nsize from experiments on cell membranes.\nThe paper is organized as follows: The model and its formal solution are in section II, the continuum limit leading to\nthe effective diffusion constant is in section III, and explicit\nusable expressions for the time dependence of the molecular\nmean square displacement are in section IV. A comparison\nto the experiments of Kusumi and collaborators [13] is given\nin section V and concluding remarks constitute section VI. A\n\n\f2\nfew calculational details may be found in the Appendix.\nII.\n\nTHE MODEL AND ITS FORMAL SOLUTION IN\nDISCRETE SPACE\n\nIn constructing our model we follow Powles et al. [18]\nin considering a random walker in an infinite 1-D space but\nwe study a discrete chain of sites with lattice constant a. Although, for the sake of simplicity, we display the results only\nin 1-D as in earlier work [18], generalization to higher dimensions (e.g., 2-D) is straightforward at least in principle. The\nmolecule, whose probability of occupation of the m-th site of\nthe chain at time t is Pm (t), hops with nearest neighbor rates\nF within a compartment of H + 1 average number of sites and\nwith a lower rate f from the end site of the compartment to\nthe first site of the adjacent compartment. For simplicity, H is\ntaken to be even here, with the site 0 at the center of one of\nthe compartments. The equation of motion is therefore\n\n0 in the barrier-less system. The dependence of the propagator on merely the difference in the site locations stems\nfrom translational invariance. By \u03b7m (t) is meant the solution\nP\nn \u03a8m\u2212n (t) Pn (0) of the homogeneous (barrier-less) problem\nfor the given initial probability distribution Pn (0).\nInformation about the location of the barriers is in the crucial function e\n\u03bc(\u000f), which, (see Appendix), for periodic placement of barriers, is given by\n\"\n#\n1\ntanh (\u03be/2)\ne\n\u03bc(\u000f) =\n\u22121 ,\n(3)\nF tanh (\u03be (H + 1) /2)\nwhere cosh \u03be = 1 + \u000f/2F. This closed form for e\n\u03bc(\u000f) is a\nconsequence of the fact that the propagators for the barrierless chain with nearest-neighbor rates, i.e., the system obeying Eq. (1) with \u2206 = 0, are products of modified Bessel\nfunctions and exponentials in the time domain, specifically\n\u03a8l (t) = Il (2Ft)e\u22122Ft , the consequent Laplace transforms being\nel (\u000f) =\n\u03a8\n\ndPm (t)\n= F [Pm+1 (t) + Pm\u22121 (t) \u2212 2Pm (t)] ,\ndt\nif m is within a compartment,\ndPr (t)\n= f [Pr+1 (t) \u2212 Pr (t)] + F [Pr\u22121 (t) \u2212 Pr (t)] ,\ndt\nfor the end site of one compartment, and\ndPr+1 (t)\n= f [Pr (t) \u2212 Pr+1 (t)] + F [Pr+2 (t) \u2212 Pr+1 (t)] ,\ndt\nfor the first site of the next compartment. Here r and r+1 mark\nthe site location of, respectively, the left and right ends of each\ncompartment boundary. The index r equals H/2+(H+1)l with\nl an integer running from \u2212\u221e to +\u221e.\nWith \u2206 = F \u2212 f , the three equations can be combined:\ndPm (t)\n= F [Pm+1 (t) + Pm\u22121 (t) \u2212 2Pm (t)]\ndt\n0\nX\n\u0001\n[Pr+1 (t) \u2212 Pr (t)] \u03b4m,r \u2212 \u03b4m,r+1\n\u2212\u2206\n\nwhere the primed summation is over the left ends r of all barriers and the \u03b4's are Kronecker deltas. Equation (1) is formally\nidentical to an equation studied in the past (see ref. [21] and\nreferences therein) to describe exciton processes in a molecular crystal. Using tildes to denote Laplace transforms and \u000f to\ndenote the Laplace variable, it is possible to solve Eq. (1) as\n(see Appendix )\n!X\n0\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u2206\nem (\u000f) = e\ne\nP\n\u03b7m (\u000f) \u2212\n\u03b7r+1 (\u000f) \u2212 e\n\u03b7r (\u000f)\n1 + \u2206e\n\u03bc(\u000f) r\nh\ni\ne m\u2212r (\u000f) \u2212 \u03a8\ne m\u2212r\u22121 (\u000f) ,\n\u00d7 \u03a8\n\nSince the \u03b7's are easily obtainable (being solutions of the\nhomogeneous equation, as explained above), in light of Eq.\n(3), Eq. (2) constitutes the full solution for the probabilities.\nA quantity of direct contact to experiments on the cell membrane is the mean square displacement. Because of the presence of barriers, one has to take care in defining this quantity,\nfocusing in particular on its dependence of where the molecule\nstarts in relation to the barriers. Translational invariance of the\ncompartments allows one to focus on any one compartment\nwithout loss of generality. We consider thus, as the most general case for a fully site-localized initial condition, the particle\nstarting at the pth site inside the central compartment so that\nPn (0) = \u03b4n,p , p being any integer in the interval [\u2212H/2, H/2].\ne m\u2212p . Then the mean square displaceIn this case, e\n\u03b7m = \u03a8\nment for a localized initial condition, defined as the average\nof (m \u2212 p)2 ,\nX\ny p (t) =\n(m \u2212 p)2 Pm (t),\n\n(1)\n\nr\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03a8mn (t) = \u03a8m\u2212n (t) is the probability propagator for the\nsystem without barriers (\u2206 = 0), i.e. the probability that\nthe molecule is at site m at time t if it was at site n at time\n\ne\u2212\u03be|l|\n.\n2F sinh \u03be\n\nm\n\nand labeled by the starting site p, is given in the Laplace domain by:\nX\ne m\u2212p (\u000f)\nyep (\u000f) =\n(m \u2212 p)2 \u03a8\nm\n\n\u2212\u2206\n\n0\nX\nr\n\nX\nh\ni\ne m\u2212r (\u000f) \u2212 \u03a8\ne m\u2212r\u22121 (\u000f) ,\ne\npr (\u000f) (m \u2212 p)2 \u03a8\n\n(4)\n\nm\n\nand has obvious dependence on the starting site p.

Equation (7) shows that if f = F, there is\nno confinement effect and Fe f f = F. If the intercompartmental motion is absent, i.e., if f = 0, the molecule cannot escape and Fe f f = 0. For this case the mean square dispacement\nsaturates to within the compartment. For small intercompartmental escape, i.e., if f << F, specifically if we can neglect\n( f /F) H << 1, then Fe f f = f (H + 1) . This means that the\nmolecule jumps large distances of compartment size at the\nlower rate f. We also see, the prediction of little interest to the\ncell membrane problem but interesting in other contexts, that\nif on arrival at a barrier the molecule is whisked away into the\nnext compartment, specifically if f >> F/H,\n\u0010 there\n\u0011 is a small\nenhancement of the motion rate: Fe f f = F 1 + H1 which cannot exceed a factor of 3/2.\nIn the Appendix it is shown that the evaluation of Eq.

We performed such simulations by following\nstandard procedures [25] in a 1-D lattice with N(H + 1) sites\nwith N large enough so that the molecule (random walker)\nnever reaches the boundaries during one run of the simulation.\nIn Fig. 1, the analytical results and the results of the simulation are shown for H = 4. We have averaged over 20000\ndifferent trajectories for each case to create the final results.\nTime is displayed in units of 1/F.\n\n\f4\nwritten as\n\u3008(m\u2212p)2\u3009\n\n16\n\n\u3008 (m\u2212p)2\u3009\n\n12\n\n2\n\np=\u00b11\n\np=\u00b12\n\nD\n\np=0\n\n8\n\nt\n\nZ\ndt\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\nt0\n\n0\n0\n\n\u0001\ngcx0 t00 dt00 .\n\n(14)\n\nNotice that e\ngc (\u000f) maintains the limiting properties of e\ng(\u000f), i.e.,\n\u000fe\ngc (\u000f) \u2192 0 as \u000f \u2192 0 and \u000f \u2192 \u221e indicating that gc (t) \u2192 0 as\nt \u2192 \u221e and t \u2192 0.

Parameters are f = 0.01, F = 2 H = 4. Solid\ncurves show the result of the simulations, averaged over 20000 runs.\nDashed lines are the analytical results. They are almost indistinguishable from one another. The inset shows the behavior at short times.\n\nWhile the above clear coincidence of the simulation results\nwith our analytic solutions establishes confidence in the analysis, the comparison has been made only for small H for simplicity. Practical application of our analytic result in the cell\nmembrane context requires an infinite number of sites within a\ncompartment, i.e., the continuum limit, because the molecules\ndiffuse, rather than hop, from location to location. Therefore,\nwe now proceed to the continuum, assuming that, as the lattice constant a \u2192 0, the products Ha, pa, and f a tend to\nthe respective constants L, x0 , and D, but that F tends to infinity an order of magnitude faster so that Fa2 tends to (the\ndiffusion constant) D. Surely, x0 is the initial position of the\nparticle inside the central compartment and D/D corresponds\nto the permeability of a partially permeable barrier, indicated\nin ref. [18] as P. Similar continuum limits may be found in\nref. [26]. By retaining only the nonvanishing terms in Eq. (8),\nthe continuum limit is given by\n!\n\u0014\ns2\n2x0\nc\ne\ng x0 (s) =\ncoth s cosh\ns\nL\ns cosh s + DDL sinh s\n!\n2x0\n2x0 \u0015\n\u2212\nsinh\ns ,\n(12)\nL\nL\np\nwhere the dimensionless quantity s = L2 D\u000f is proportional\nto the square root of the Laplace variable, the subscript x0 denotes the initial location on the continuum, and the superscript\nc is a reminder of the fact that we are treating the continuum\nlimit.\nThe continuum limit of Eq. (11) becomes (this corresponds\nto an average over x0 )\ne\ngc (s) =\n\nsinh s\ns cosh s +\n\nDe f f\nD\u2212De f f\n\n.\n\n(13)\n\nsinh s\nc\n\nIn terms of the inverse Laplace transform g (t) of Eq. (12),\nthe mean square displacement in the continuum limit can be\n\nD\n.\n1 + DDL\n\n(15)\n\nThis result, which appears as the continuum limit of our more\ngeneral discrete expressions, is equivalent to that obtained in\nref. [18].\n\nIV.\n\nEXPLICIT USABLE EXPRESSIONS FOR THE MEAN\nSQUARE DISPLACEMENT\n\nFor most of the rest of the paper we will examine only the\ncontinuum limit expressions because they allow direct comparison to experiment in the specific problem of molecular\nmotion in cell membranes. Other systems such as those involving the hopping of excitations in a molecular solid [21]\nare better treated with the help of the more general discrete\ncase expressions we have obtained above. We will now use the\nnotation y x0 to mean h(x \u2212 x0 )2 i and describe how to take the\ninverse Laplace transform of Eq.(12) to get the mean square\ndisplacement in the time domain, with the help of Eq. (14).\nNote that the mean square displacement in the Laplace domain\ncan be written as\n!\nL4 1\n1\nyf\n\u2212\n\u03b6(s; x0 , L) +\nx0 (s) =\n8D s4 s3 cosh s\nL 4 De f f 1\ntanh s\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u03b6(s; x0 , L), (16)\n3\n8D D \u2212 De f f s cosh s + De f f sinh s\nD\u2212De f f\n\nwhere\n!\n!\n2x0\n2x0\n2x0\n\u03b6(s; x0 , L) = coth s cosh\ns \u2212\nsinh\ns .\nL\nL\nL\n\n(17)\n\nAverage of Eq.

(16) and (18), the mean square displacement expression in the Laplace domain appears decomposed naturally as a sum of two parts. The first term represents the mean square displacement for the case of impenetrable barriers. It can be inverted easily to give a simple analytic\nexpression in the time domain:\n\uf8eb\n\u0010\n\u0011\uf8f6\n\u03c02\n2 4D\n\u221e\nX\ne\u2212 4 (2n+1) L2 t \uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\nL2 \uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec 1\n(19)\n\uf8ec \u2212 32\n\uf8f7.\n2 \uf8ec\uf8ed 3\n\u03c04 (2n + 1)4 \uf8f7\uf8f8\nn=0\nThis result for the mean square displacement of a totally confined particle and related expressions for the autocorrelation\nfunction of the displacement agree with published expressions\nthat have appeared earlier in the study of nuclear magnetic\nresonance microscopy and of animal motion in home ranges\n[22, 23].\nMany problems in physics are tackled in terms of an exactly soluble system to which a perturbation is added. The\nchoice of the partition of the system into an unperturbed and a\nperturbed part is obviously never unique and is itself an interesting aspect of theoretical study. This happens, for instance,\nin quasiparticle transport in molecular crystals and aggregates\n[21] wherein a localized and a delocalized part of the system\nrepresent two such possible choices. We see here that our\npresent system displays such a choice in that one may regard\nthe unperturbed part of our random walk problem as being either the walk on the free chain perturbed by the presence of\nthe multiple barriers, or as the confined motion of the walker\nwithin a single well with two impenetrable barriers ( f = 0)\nperturbed by a leakage to the rest of the chain. In the first\ncase, represented by Eq. (5), the unperturbed system is represented by free motion on a chain. In the second, with the\npartition described by Eq. (18), it is Eq.(19) that describes the\nunperturbed system.\nWe now calculate the inverse Laplace transform of the full\nmean square displacement, focusing directly on e\ng(\u000f)/\u000f 2 since\nit is the double time integral of g(t) that is required in the calculation. Here, and henceforth in this section, we drop the\nsuperscript c on g to avoid clutter and do not display the explicit dependence on the starting location x0 .

It allows one to invert Laplace transforms of functions\nof the square root of the Laplace variable if the corresponding\ntransforms of just the variable are known.\nIn the time domain, we have\nZ t\nZ t0\ny(t) = 2Dt \u2212 2D\ndt0\ndt00\n0\n0\nI\n00\n\u00d7\nd\u000fe\ng (\u000f) e\u000ft ,\n(21)\nC\n\nwhere C is the Bromwich contour enclosing all the singularities of e\ng (\u000f) (note that all of the singular points of Eq. (12)\n\nare on the imaginary axis). After performing some simple (although tedious) algebraic manipulations, employing the notation \u03b3=De f f / ( D \u2212 De f f ), \u03b1=2x0 /L, \u03c4=4Dt/L2 , and using\nEq.

Note that each of the functions\nw1 , w2 and w3 has infinitely many poles besides the pole at\ns=0. The rest of the poles of w1 are all simple poles (as can\neasily be seen by Taylor-expanding sinh s) located at s=im\u03c0\nwhere m = \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b13... . For w2 and w3 , we cannot find the\nexact locations of the poles analytically because of the need to\nsolve a transcendental equation. Although we do not have an\nanalytical expression for the location of these poles, we know\nthat they are all simple poles because the first derivative of\ns cosh s + \u03b3 sinh s does not vanish at sn .

(27) and\n(28) to get \u03c32 (\u03c4) and \u03c33 (\u03c4). In doing this, we use the bisection\nmethod to find the first few thousands of the roots of \u03c32 (\u03c4)\n2\nwith an accuracy of 10\u221213 . Because of the factor e s \u03c4 in Eqs.\n(27) and (28), the sums converge very fast as sn 's are purely\nimaginary. Note that lim s\u2192sn cosh(\u03b1s) and lim s\u2192sn sinh(\u03b1s) lie\nin [\u22121, 1] and the magnitude of lim s\u2192sn ((1+\u03b3) cosh s+s sinh s)\ntends to \u221e with increasing Im(sn ). As a result, it is possible to\nobtain accurate results without summing over a large number\nof residues. A similar procedure can be followed [29] to find\nthe inverse Laplace transform of Eq. (18).\nWe have displayed several of the details of the inversion\nprocedure we have used because of its involved nature and\nbecause it is not often that (even partial) inversions resulting\nin explicitly usable time domain expressions are possible in\nsimilar problems.

The\nfirst is Fig 4b (left) in ref. [19] which is about the diffusion of a gold-tagged G-protein coupled \u03bc-opioid receptor;\n\nthe second is Fig 2b in ref. [20] which is about the diffusion of a phospholipid molecule (1,2-dioleoylsn-glycero-3phosphoethanolamine). Both sets of observations refer to normal rat kidney cells. The observations were made at a time\nresolution of 25\u03bcs which is high enough to capture the change\nin the diffusion constant at times long and short compared to\nexpected values of L2 /4D.\nWe first fitted our y vs t curve, given by Eq. (21), to the\ndata in Fig 4b of ref. [19], both to the x and y components\nof the mean square displacement, and extracted the compartment sizes through standard procedures. It is not possible to\nmake accurate deductions because the data in the literature are\navailable only for single trajectories rather than for ensemble\naverages for a large number of them. Within this limitation,\nwe have been able to conclude by the application of our theory\nto the data that the linear extent of the confining compartment\nshould lie between 250nm and 470nm. Our conclusion is in\nagreement with the distribution of compartment sizes given in\nFig 4d of ref. [19] and generally with values discussed in ref.\n[11].\nA different system we examined is that involving the diffusion of smaller transmembrane molecules than proteins: phospholipids [20]. By evaluating Eq. (21) using experimentally\ndeduced values for D, De f f and L, we verified that conclusions derived in ref. [20] are in agreement with theory. This is\ndisplayed in Fig. 3. To show the agreement clearly, we use for\nthe compartment size, L, a substantially different value from\nthat deduced in ref. [20], 230 nm, and point out that the y vs\nt curves found by using Eq. (21) do not then agree with the\nexperiment at all.\nAs the data corresponds to a single trajectory, it is worthwhile to explore the effects of the initial position of the\nmolecule on the dynamics. In Fig. 4, we show the effect of the\ninitial position of the particle on the y vs t curve. The parameters D, De f f and L are the same as the ones reported in ref.\n[20]. For illustrative purposes we also show the y vs t curve\naveraged over all initial positions as the dashed line in Fig. 4.\n\n\f7\n0.06\nyx\nyy\nL=230 nm\nL=2300 nm\nL=23 nm\n\ny (\u03bcm2)\n\n0.04\n\n0.02\n\n0\n0\n\n0.0025\n\n0.005\ntime (s)\n\n0.0075\n\n0.01\n\nFIG. 3: Comparison of diffusion observations of phospholipids reported in ref. [20] to our theoretical predictions based on 3 disparate\nvalues of the compartment size L used in our Eq. (21). One of the\nvalues used is that deduced in ref. [20], 230 nm. There is very good\nagreement of theory (solid line) and observations as shown. Each\nof the other two values differs by an order of magnitude: 2300 nm\n(dashed line) and 23 nm (dotted line). In both these cases theory\nshows poor agreement with experiment. We have used D=4.6 \u03bcm2 s\u22121\nand De f f =1.2 \u03bcm2 s\u22121 .\n\nThe other aim is to understand, in general, the problem of a\nrandom walker moving in a region with confinement. Working in a 1-D system for simplicity, we gave the exact solution\nof the probabilities in the Laplace domain for a discrete chain,\nderived from them analytic solutions for the mean square displacement of the molecule, and introduced memory functions\nto understand the evolution physically. We achieved a detailed\nunderstanding of the motion arising from repeated encounters\nof the random walker with the barriers and dependence on initial placement of the walker. These discrete solutions are of\nuse not only to the present problem but also to diverse contexts\nsuch as the motion of excitations in crystals and molecular aggregates.\nWe took the continuum limit of our results to obtain them\nin terms of parameters that can be measured experimentally in\nthe context of the cellular membrane and presented a procedure to get explicit and easily usable expressions in the time\ndomain. While a piece of the Laplace inversion has to be done\neither approximately or numerically, other physically relevant\nparts are implemented fully analytically, the entire calculation\nbeing quite usable from a practical standpoint. Our expressions are more useful in this regard than those available earlier, e.g., in ref. [18]. Specifically, our results may be typified\nby the prescription for the instantaneous diffusion coefficient\nnormalized to the diffusion constant, i.e., D(t)/D given in Eq.\n(30).

One is to develop an efficient and useful formalism\nto describe the motion of a transmembrane molecule on a cellular membrane following ideas inherent in the current membrane skeleton fence model of Kusumi and collaborators [11].\n\n(31)\n\nD\u2212De f f\n\nHere \u03b1, defined earlier as 2x0 /L, measures the initial location\nrelative to the compartment size, and \u03c4 = 4Dt/L2 is a dimensionless time. At infinite time, \u03c4 \u2192 \u221e, since the theta function\ntends to 1 and the summation over the sn 's vanishes because of\nthe exponential factor (note that that the s's lie on the imaginary axis), D(\u03c4) becomes the effective diffusive constant De f f .\nAt the initial time, on the other hand, the theta function vanishes and D(\u03c4) takes the value D for all initial placements of\nthe molecule not at the edge, x0 , L/2. The mean square displacement is obtained trivially from the integral of the right\nhand side of Eq. (31). Of the three terms to be computed in\nEq. (31), the first two are given analytically in our theory and\nthe last is obtained numerically.\nOur expressions are characterized by three parameters: L,\nthe compartment size, D, the initial diffusion constant (as t \u2192\n0), and De f f , the effective diffusion constant (as t \u2192 \u221e). We\nshowed how our theory can be used directly to deduce the\ncompartment size L by fitting the analytic expressions to data\nobtained in single particle tracking experiments [11, 19].\n\n\f8\n\np=0\np = \u00b14\np = \u00b15\nAvg\n\nd(y)/dt\n\n2F\n\nwhich is neither at the center of the compartment nor at its\nedge, shown in the plot by the solid curve (p = \u00b14), we see\nthat the effective motion occurs with an initial transfer rate\n2F and decreases, both features being shared with the case of\ncentral placement, but that there is a subsequent increase to a\npeak and decrease to the final effective value, features shared\nwith the case of edge placement.\n\nF+f\n\n2Feff\n\u22122\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\nTime (in units of 1/F)\n\n2\n\n10\n\nFIG. 5: Effect of initial placement of the random walker at site p\nwithin a compartment on the time dependence of the effective transfer rate which, in the continuum limit, would be proportional to the\ntime-dependent effective diffusion coefficient. Each compartment\nhas 11 sites, i.e., H = 10, and f /F = 0.01. Averaging equally over\nall initially localized placements results, as shown by the dash-dotted\nline, in a monotonically decreasing transfer rate. However, interesting structures appear for initial placements at the center of, end of,\nand elsewhere in the compartment as shown. See text for explanation.\n\nAn interesting outcome of our analysis is the description of\nthe explicit influence of the initial placement of the random\nwalker. The influence is observed in the time dependence of\nthe mean square displacement. The dependence is evidently\na consequence of the relative location of the barriers and the\nsite of initial placement. With the help of the analytical expressions we have obtained, we plot in Fig. 5, the instantaneous time derivative of the mean square displacement, a\nquantity that is proportional to the instantaneous diffusion coefficient D(t) in the continuum limit, for several cases of the\ninitial placement p of the molecule within the compartment.\nWe show the discrete case so that the results can be carried\nover to other physical contexts such as excitation transfer as\nwell. We observe that the time derivative of the mean square\ndisplacement does not simply change monotonically from an\ninitial value to a lower final value. Instead, interesting structures appear.\nThe compartment considered in the plot has a total of 11\nsites. For central initial placement (p = 0), we see (this is the\ntop curve shown dashed) the appearance of a curious dip at\nthe bottom of the curve. The dip means that for some time the\nmolecule diffuses slower than what it does eventually via the\nfinal effective diffusion constant. The situation changes quite\na bit as we vary the site of initial placement, although the final\neffective diffusion constant always remains unaffected. For\ninitial placement at the edge of the compartment, denoted in\nFig. 5 by the dotted curve (p = \u00b15), the molecule begins with\nan effective transfer rate which is not 2F as in other cases but\na lower value F + f. It then rises first, reaches a peak, and then\ndecreases to the final effective value. For initial placement\n\nIt is easy to understand all these features. The molecule, if\nplaced centrally within the compartment, tends to move initially with the transfer rate or diffusion constant characteristic of the barrier-less system until it meets the barrier. At this\npoint it crosses the barrier more slowly and the effective transfer rate drops. When the molecule has diffused to the next\ncompartment it is outside the immediate influence of the barrier and the effective diffusion is therefore faster. The combined effect of repeated free diffusion and barrier-hindered\ndiffusion eventually brings the effective diffusion constant to\nits long time value. If, however, the initial placement of the\nmolecule is at the compartment edge, it already begins moving\nwith an effective diffusion constant lower than the free value\nbecause of the immediate effect of the barrier. It diffuses faster\nfrom then on until other barrier encounters including the one\nat the other edge of the initial compartment decrease the rate\nof diffusion. For intermediate initial placements these effects\nhappen one after the other as the molecule encounters first the\nbarrier on one side and then the one on the other side of the\ncompartment.\nWhether the structures described are visible in a specific\nkind of experiment will obviously depend on the freedom one\nhas in initial placement of the random walker. We believe in\nlight of the data that we have seen in the cell membrane field\nthat the average alone matters and that the average, as shown\nin the plot, shows merely a monotonic decrease of the effective\ndiffusion constant. The dips have been seen in the theoretical\nwork of Powles et al [18]. However, no explanation has been\ngiven. Indeed, (see Fig. 3 of ref. [18] and the subsequent\ndiscussion) the authors of that work referred to the dip as an\n\"unexpected minimum\" and did not connect it to the dynamics\nwe have described above.\nMissing from our present analysis are the effects of disorder\nin the placement and height of the barriers, i.e., in the random\nnature of H and f in real systems. Static disorder effects of\nthis nature are being analyzed by us in several different ways,\nincluding the replacement of the periodic expressions for the\nquantity \u03bc used in the present paper by random counterparts\nthat take into account probability distributions, and the use of\neffective medium theories. These analyses will be reported in\na separate publication. Of interest to us are also calculations\nof random walks in the presence of dynamic fences that allow\nus to address properly the case where the moving molecules\nare the lipids while the fences are made by the proteins (as has\nbeen suggested in the literature [11], and calculations which\nare valid in the presence of intermolecular interactions.\n\n\f9\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was supported in part by the NSF under grant no.\nINT-0336343, by NSF/NIH Ecology of In- fectious Diseases\nunder grant no.
