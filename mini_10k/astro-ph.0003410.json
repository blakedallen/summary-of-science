Introduction\nRecently a wealth of optical and UV spectra in Fe VI have been observed from gaseous nebulae and hot H II regions\nin general, and from hot white dwarfs (Jordan et al. 1995). Emission lines from transitions among the first 19 finestructure levels dominated by the ground configuration 3d3 also appear in nova V 1016 Cygni (Mammano and Ciatti,\n1975) and RR Telescoppii (McKenna et al. 1997). Optical spectra of [Fe VI] have been observed for many transitions\nin planetary Nebulae such as NGC 6741 (Hyung and Aller 1997a), NGC 7662 (Hyung and Aller 1997b), IC 351\n(Feibelman et al. 1996), and others. It is therefore interesting to simulate these spectra using accurate atomic data\nfrom the Iron Project (Hummer et al. 1993) obtained using ab initio calculations.\nGiven the state-of-the-art observational accuracy of astrophysical work, it is necessary to use accurate atomic\nradiative and electron impact excitation (EIE) data in order to calculate accurately the intensities ratios of prominent\ndensity and temperature sensitive lines of [Fe VI]. In the collisional-radiative (hereafter CR) model, all of the level\ncontributions are coupled together and need to be considered. Furthermore, we have recently shown (Chen and Pradhan 2000; hereafter CP00) that in addition to EIE and spontaneous radiative decay, level populations in Fe VI are\nSend offprint requests to: Guo Xin Chen\n1\nThe complete tables of transition probabilities are available in electronic form at the CDS via anonymous ftp 130.79.128.5\n\n\f2\n\nGuo Xin Chen and Anil K. Pradhan: Atomic data from the Iron Project\n\nsignificantly affected by fluorescent excitation (hereafter FLE) via a radiation backgound, typically a UV continuum.\nFrom an atomic physics point of view this requires additional physical mechanisms to be included in the atomic model\nin order to correctly predict the line intensities. In fact, it was demonstrated in CP00 that the observed [Fe VI] optical\nline ratios in the high excitation PNe NGC 6741 can not be interpreted without taking account of the FLE mechanism\n(as proposed by Lucy 1995; see also Bautista, Peng, and Pradhan 1996), which. depends on strong dipole allowed\nexcitations from the ground, or low-lying levels, and cascades into the upper levels of observed transitions.\nIn order to implement the FLE mechanism in the CR model therefore, one needs both the forbidden and the\ndipole allowed transition probabilities, in addition to the EIE rate coefficients. Accurate EIE collison strengths and\nrate coefficients of Fe VI have recently been computed under the IP by the Ohio-State group using the R-matrix\nmethod. The excitation rate coefficients differ considerably from previous works (IP.XXXVII, Chen and Pradhan\n1999b; hereafter CP99b). The present work has a two-fold aim: (i) to compute transition proabilities Fe VI, and (ii) to\nuse a CR model with FLE to compute line intensity ratios as possible temperature and density diagnostics. It is further\nshown that, following CP00, the radiation temperature of the central source and the distance of the emission region\nmay be determined if the FLE mechanism is operative. The extended CR model takes account of the two competing\nexcitation mechanisms, due to electron excitation (EIE), and photon excitations (FLE).\nA large number of line ratios of [Fe VI] are examined. Density and temperature diagnostics line ratios are determined\nand applied to interpret observational data from a sample of planetary nebulae. The spectral diagnostics developed\nherein should have general applications to various other astrophysical sources.\n2. Atomic calculations\nThe EIE calculations are described in detail in CP99a,b, and compared with previous works. Below, we briefly summarise the qualitative aspects of those results. The next subsection discusses in detail the present calculations for the\nforbidden and allowed A-values for Fe VI.\n2.1. Electron Impact Excitation of Fe VI\nWith the exception of two calculations two decades ago, there were no other calculations until the recent work reported\nin CP99a,b. It is difficult to consider the relativistic effects together with the electron correlation effects in this complex\natomic system, and the coupled channel calculations necessary for such studies are very computer intensive. The two\nprevious sources for the excitation rates of Fe VI are the non-relativistic close coupling (CC) calculations by Garstang\net al. (1978) and the distorted-wave (DW) calculations by Nussbaumer and Storey (1978). Although the Garstang et al.\n(1978) calculations were in the CC approximation, they used a very small basis set and did not obtain the resonance\nstructures; their results are given only for the averaged values. The Nussbaumer and Storey (1978) calculations were in\nthe DW approximations that does not enable a treatment of resonances. Therefore neither set of calculations included\nresonances or the coupling effects due to higher configurations. Owing primarily to these factors we find that the\nearlier excitation rates of Nussbaumer and Storey are lower by up to factors of three or more when compared to the\nnew Fe VI rates presented in CP99b.\n2.2. Radiative transition probabilities\nThe target expansions in the present work are based on the 34-term wave function expansion for Fe VI developed\nby Bautista (1996) using the SUPERSTRUCTURE program in the non-relativistic calculations for photoionization\ncross sections of Fe V. The SUPERSTRUCTURE calculations for Fe VI were extended to include relativistic fine\nstructure using the Breit-Pauli Hamiltonian (Eissner et al. 1974; Eissner 1998). The designations for the 80 levels (34\nLS terms) dominated by the configurations 3d3 , 3d2 4s and 3d2 4p and their observed energies (Sugar and Corliss,\n1985), are shown in Table 1. These observed energies were used in the Hamiltonian diagonalization to obtain the\nR-matrix surface amplitudes in stage STGH (Berrington et al. 1995). This table also provides the key to the level\nindices for transitions in tabulating dipole-allowed and forbidden transition probabilities and the Maxwellian-averaged\ncollision strengths from CP99a,b. Examining the new Breit-Pauli SUPERSTRUCTURE calculations we deduce that\nthe computed energy values for levels 7 and 13; levels 11 and 12 in Table 1 of CP99a should be reversed given the\nlevel designations, respectively. An indication of the accuracy of the target eigenfunctions may be obtained from the\ncalculated energy levels in Table 1 of CP99a, and from the computed length and velocity oscillator strengths for some\nof the dipole fine structure transitions given in their Table 2. The agreement between the length and velocity oscillator\nstrengths is generally about 10%, an acceptable level of accuracy for a complex iron ion.\n\n\fGuo Xin Chen and Anil K. Pradhan: Atomic data from the Iron Project\n\n3\n\n2.2.1. Dipole allowed fine-structure transitions\nThe weighted oscillator strength gf or the Einstein A-coefficient for a dipole allowed fine-structure transition is\nproportional to the generalised line strength (Seaton 1987) defined, in either length form or velocity form, by the\nequations\nN\n+1\nX\n\nSL =|< \u03a8j |\n\nzk | \u03a8i >|2\n\n(1)\n\nk=1\n\nand\nSV = \u03c9\n\n\u22122\n\n|\n\n*\n\n\u03a8j |\n\nN\n+1\nX\nk=1\n\n\u2202\n| \u03a8i\n\u2202zk\n\n+\n\n|2\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03c9 is the incident photon energy in Ry, and \u03a8i and \u03a8j are the wave functions representing the initial and\nfinal states, respectively.\nUsing the transition energy, Eij , between the initial and final states, gi fij and Aji for this transition can be obtained\nfrom S as\ngi fij =\n\nEij\nS\n3\n\n(3)\n\nand\n1 3 gi 2\nE1\nE fij = 2.6774 \u00d7 109 (Ej \u2212 Ei )3 Sij\n/gj\n\u03b1\n2 gj ij\n\nAji (a.u.) =\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03b1 = 1/137.036 is the fine structure constant in a.u., and gi , gj are the statistical weights of the initial and\nfinal states, respectively.

Transition probabilities AL are\nalso given in the length formulation, which is generally more accurate than the velocity formulation in the present\ncalculations. Experimental level energies are used to improve the accuracy of the calculated gf and A-values. All of\nthese E1 transition probabilities of Fe VI were incorporated in the calculation of line ratios when accounting for the\nFLE effect by the UV continuum radiation field (details below).\n2.2.2. Forbidden electric quadrupole (E2) and magnetic dipole (M 1) transitions\nThe Breit-Pauli mode of the SUPERSTRUCTURE code was also used to calculate the E2 and the M 1 transitions\nin Fe VI. The configuration expansion was adapted from that used to optimise the lowest 34 LS terms by Bautista\n(1996). The spectroscopic configurations,the correlation configurations and the scaling parameters \u03bbnl for the ThomasFermi-Dirac-Amaldi type potential of orbital nl are listed in Table 3 and Table 4 of CP99a. Much effort was devoted to\nchoosing the correlation configurations to optimise the target wavefunctions, within the constraint of computational\nconstraints associated with large memory requirements for many of the 3p open shell configurations.

The results\ncalculated by Garstang et al. (1978) and by Nussbaumer and Storey (1978) are also given for comparison, where\navailable. For 70 transitions in Table 3 the AE2 are much smaller than the AM1 , by up to several orders of magnitude\nfor some transitions. While for the other 60 transitions, AE2 are greater than the AM1 . The computed AE2 and AM1\nfor all the other 1101 transitions within the first 80 levels are given in Table 4 (a partial table is given in the text;\nthe complete Table 4 is available electronically from the CDS library). There are no other calculations in literature\nfor these transitions for comparisons. There are many cases where one of the two transition probabilities is negligible,\nusually the AE2 . But the case of Fe VI is somewhat different from that of Fe III (Nahar and Pradhan 1996), where\nthe AE2 are greater than AM1 for nearly half the total number of transitions, especially those with large excitation\nenergies.\n3. The 80-level collision radiative model with fluorescence\nA CR model with 80 levels for Fe VI is employed to calculate level populations, Ni , relative to the ground level. The\nemitted flux per ion for transition j \u2192 i, or the emissivity \u01ebji (ergs cm\u22123 s\u22121 ), is given by,\n\u01ebji = Nj Aji h\u03bdij\n\n(10)\n\nThe line intensities ratios, for example, \u01ebji /\u01ebkl for transitions j-i and k-l are then calculated. A computationally\nefficient code to set up CR matrix in CR model is employed to solve the coupled linear equations for all levels involved\n(Cai and Pradhan 1993).\nWe can write the rate coupled equations of statistical equilibrium in CR matrix form:\nC = NeQ + A\n\n(11)\n\nwhere N e is the electron density, and\nCii = 0\n\nCij = qij N e (j > i)\n\nCij = qij N e + Aij\n\n(j < i)\n\n(12)\n\nIn the above model, we have assumed the optically thin case. FLE by continua pumping and other pumping mechanisms\nare not considered in this mode. Also, the line emission photons from the tramsitions within the ions are assumed to\nescape directly without absorption (Case A).\nIn a thermal continuum radiation field of optically thick gaseous nebulae, the ion can be excited by photon pumping\nor de-excited by induced emission. With the FLE mechanism for excitation or de-excitation in the CR model, Eqs.\n[10] and [11] should be replaced by\nCij = qij N e + Jij Bij (j > i)\n\nCij = qij N e + Aij + Jij Bij (j < i)\n\n(13)\n\nwhere Jij is the mean intensity of the continuum at the frequency for transition i \u2192 j. Bij is the Einstein absorption\ncoefficient or induced emission coefficients. For a blackbody radiation with effective temperature Tef f , Jij can be\nexpressed as\nJij = W F\u03bd = W\n\n8\u03c0h\u03bd 3\n1\nc2 eh\u03bd/kTef f \u2212 1\n\n(14)\n\n\fGuo Xin Chen and Anil K.

More accurate specific luminosity density function versus frequency, or\nthe mean intensity, may be employed in ohter applications, e.g. in the synchrotron continuum pumping in the Crab\nnebula (Davidson & Fesen 1985; Lucy 1995).\nWith the notations used and explanations given above, the equation of statistical equlibrium for the kth level has\nthe form\nX\n(Nj Cjk \u2212 Nk Ckj ) = 0\n(15)\nj6=k\n\nThe attenuation effect in continuum intensity Jij has been neglected in the above rate equations, i.e. there are\nno optical depths along the line of observation in the nebula to the continuum radiation source. This approximation\nmay be responsible for part of the difference between the calculated and observed line ratios as shown in Table 6\nbelow. With this approximation, the rate coefficients Cij are independent of level population Nk ; the rate equations\nare therefore linear and can be solved directly.\n4. [Fe VI] line ratios: temperature and density diagnostics\nSome of the salient features of the spectral diagnostics with FLE are discussed in CP00. It is shown that the line ratios\ncan be parametrized as a function of Te , Ne , Tef f , W (r). For a given subset of (Te , Ne ) a line ratio may describe the\nlocus of the subsets of (Tef f , W (r)), which then defines (constrains) a contour of possible parameters. CP00 present\n3-dimensional plots of the line ratio vs. (Tef f , W (r)), for given (Te , Ne ). While it is clear that the Tef f or the W (r) can\nnot be determined uniquely and independently, it was found that the observed value of the line ratio cuts across the\nsurface (double-valued function in Tef f , W (r)), along the contour of likely values that lie within. The variation of the\nintensity ratio with effective temperature and the distance of the emitting region may constrain these two macrospopic\nquantities, in addition to the determination of the local electron temperature and density.\nThe spectral diagnostics so developed is applied to the analysis of [Fe VI] lines from planetary nebulae as described\nbelow.\n4.1. Planetary Nebulae\nThe central stars of planetary nebulae correspond to high stellar radiation temperatures (e.g. Harman and Seaton\n1966), of the order of 105 K. Resonant absorption was first discussed by Seaton (1968), who pointed out the efficacy\nof this mechanism in line formation of [O III], in addition to electron scattering and recombination, estimated the\noxygen abundance taking this into account. We might expect, a priori, that if the atomic structure of the emitting ion\nis subject to FLE then the PNe might be good candidates for radiative fluorescence studies in general, as shown in\nCP00.\nIn recent years, Hyung and Aller in particular have made a number of extensive spectral studies of PNe, and\nin nearly all of those [Fe VI] optical emission lines have been detected (Table 5). Physical conditions in some of the\nPNe's are listed in Table 5. Observed line ratios are used to develop the temperature-density diagnostics for [Fe VI].\nAn earlier study of [Fe VI] line ratios was carried out by Nussbaumer and Storey (1978) who calculated a number\nof line emissivities relative to the \u03bb 5146 \u00c5 line. Owing to new atomic collisional and radiative data our line ratios\ndiffer significantly from the earlier work for many lines. Also, Nussbaumer and Storey (1978) did not take the FLE\nmechanism into account. On examination of the observed [Fe VI] lines in several PNe, we noted that the \u03bb 5146 \u00c5 line\nwas mis-identified and assigned to [O I] in the PNe labeled a,c,d in Table 5 (in a private communication we confirmed\nthe new identification with Prof. Lawrence Aller, who noted that [Fe VI] was the more likely source, particularly in\nNGC 6741 which is a high excitation object).\nA comprehensive study of most of the possible line ratios was carried out as functions of Te , Ne , and with and\nwithout FLE, at various radiation temperatures Tef f and dilution factors W(R\u2217 /r). In Table 6 we present line ratios\nfor lines which frequently appear in various kinds of PNe's, with different physical conditions, with respect to the line\n\u03bb 5146\u00c5 (as in Nussbaumer and Storey 1978). The partial Table 6 given in the text contains only those line ratios\nfor which observed values are available. The complete Table 6 (available electronically from the CDS library), gives a\nnumber of other line ratios computes in a similar manner relative to the \u03bb 5146\u00c5.\nLine ratios are calculated with different dilution factors within the CR model in order to evaluate the influence of\nFLE under different conditions. The first four entries are: no FLE, FLE with W = 5 \u00d7 10\u221216 , 10\u221213 , 10\u221210 respectively.\n\n\f6\n\nGuo Xin Chen and Anil K. Pradhan: Atomic data from the Iron Project\n\nThe Nussbaumer and Storey (1978) values are given as the fifth set of entries for comparison. Also, observational\nvalues are give in these entries (under \"Obs\") for various planetary nebulae, wherever available.\n4.2. NGC 6741\nObservations of this high excitation nebula by Aller et al. (1985) and Hyung and Aller (1997a) show several optical\n[Fe VI] lines in the spectrum from the multiplet 3d3 (4 F \u22124 P ) at 5177, 5278, 5335, 5425, 5427, 5485, 5631 and 5677 \u00c5\nand from the (4 F \u22122 G) at 4973 and 5146 \u00c5 for NGC 6741. The basic observational parameters, in particular the inner\nand the outer radii needed to estimate the distance from the central star and the dilution factor, are described in these\nworks, and their diagnostic diagrams based on the spectra of a number of ions give Te = 12500K, Ne = 6300cm\u22123,\nand a stellar Tef f = 140, 000K. As the ionization potentials of Fe V and Fe VI are 75.5 eV and 100 eV respectively,\ncompared to that of He II at 54.4 eV, Fe VI emission should stem from the fully ionized He2+ zone, and within the\ninner radius, i.e. r(Fe VI) \u2264 rin . With these parameters we obtain the dilution factor to be W = 10\u221214 ; the dominant\n[Fe VI] emission region could be up to a factor of 3 closer to the star, with W up to 10\u221213 , without large variations in\nthe results obtained.\nFigs. 1 and 2 show all the line ratios for NGC 6741 (with respect to the 5146 \u00c5 line), where observational values are\navailable (Hyung and Aller 1997a). [Fe VI] line ratios are presented as a function of several parameters, in particular\nwith and without FLE. In all cases the FLE = 0 curve fails to correlate with the observed line ratios, and shows no\ndependence on Ne (an unphysical result), whereas with FLE we obtain a consistent Ne \u2248 1000-2000 cm\u22123 , suitable for\nthe high ionization [Fe VI] zone. The derived Ne is somewhat lower than the Ne range 2000 - 6300 cm\u22123 obtained from\nseveral ionic spectra (including [O II] and [S II]) by Hyung and Aller (1997a). The total observational uncertainties\ncited by Hyung and Aller (1997a) are 17.6%, 19.5%, 38.9%, 15.6%, 23.2%, 25.5%, 10.2%, 14.5%, and 36.5% for 4973,\n5177, 5278, 5335, 5425, 5427, 5485, 5631 and 5677 \u00c5 (with respect to the 5146 \u00c5 line), respectively (Hyung and Aller\n1997a). However, an indication of the overall uncertainties may be obtained from the 1st line ratio, 4973/5146, which\nis independent of both Te and Ne since both lines have the same upper level, and which therefore depends only on\nthe ratio of the A-values and energy separations; the observed value of 1.048 agrees closely with the theoretical value\nof 0.964. Whereas the combined observational and theoretical uncertainties for any one line ratio can be significant,\nmost measured line ratios (except three line ratios 5278/5146, 5427/5146 and 5677/5146 which will be analyzed in the\nnext paragraph) yield a remarkably consistent Ne ([Fe VI]) and substantiate the spectral model with FLE.\nWhile the electron density of the [Fe VI] in NGC 6741 is determined to be \u2248 1000-2000 cm\u22123 from most of the\nobservational line ratios as demonstrated above, we note from Fig. 2 that three line ratios 5278/5146, 5427/5146 and\n5677/5146 deviate from this Ne considerably. It is interesting to estimate the possible errors in these three observational\nline ratios from our theoretical method and model. Several pairs of line ratios are shown in Table 7 that have a common\nupper level. These line ratios depend only on the ratio of the A-values and energy differences and are independent of\nthe detailed physical conditions in PN. They can be used as important means to determine possible, systematic errors\nin the observed line intensties as described below.\nFrom the line ratio 4973/5146, independent of PN physical conditions as mentioned above, and the other five line\nratios in Table 7, we conclude that the intensity of the reference line 5146 \u00c5 should be very accurate. It is very unlikely\nthat the error for each pair of these line ratios are the same and show the same tendency. An error estimate of 6.8%\nfor this line given by Hyung and Aller (1997a) is consistent with our justification. As such, the observed intensities\nof lines \u03bb\u03bb 4973, 5177, 5335, 5425, 5485, and 5631 \u00c5 should be of high accuracy (within 20%). This conclusion is\nalso supported by the good agreement between the two other theoretical and observational line ratios 5335/5485 and\n5425/5632 shown in Table 7.\nBased on these arguments, we find that the observed ('Hamilton') line intensity of 0.087 (Hyung and Aller 1997a)\n(relative to the uniform flux of I(H\u03b2)=100) for 5278 \u00c5 should be reduced by about 40% from a comparison of the line\nratio 5278/5425 in Table 7. Similarly, the reported line intensity of 0.118 for the line 5427 \u00c5 should be reduced by\nabout 70% or more, and the value 0.122 for the 5677 \u00c5 should be increased by 20% or so from the comparison of the\nline ratio 5427/5677 in Table 7. If our justifications for the errors in the intensities of these three lines are correct, the\ncorresponding three line ratios shown in Fig. 2 will also yield the same and consistent Ne as do the other line ratios,\nparticularly those in Fig. 1. It is interesting to note that the uncertainties given by Hyung and Aller (1997a) are also\nlarge (as inferred above), although the line 5427 \u00c5 could have a much higher uncertainty (intensity larger or lower).\n4.3. IC 351\nThe physical conditions of IC 351, especially the effective temperature Tef f and the distance of PN emission region to\nthe central white dwarf (WD), are highly uncertain. We first apply our method, as developed in CP00, to determine\n\n\fGuo Xin Chen and Anil K. Pradhan: Atomic data from the Iron Project\n\n7\n\nthe appropriate Tef f and the dilution factor W(r). Tef f is thereby determined to be 80,000\u00b110,000 K. This is\nconsiderably different from Tef f =58,100K cited by Feibelman et al. (1996). It is interesting to note that the Tef f\ndetermined by our spetral method with FLE agrees with the He II Zanstra temperature, which is 85,000K according\nto Preite-Martinez and Pottasch (1983). As pointed out by Preite-Martinez and Pottasch (1983), different methods\n(Zanstra method, color temperature and energy balance method, etc.) used to determine the effective temperature of\nPN remain discrepant; but the He II Zanstra method is applicable to optically thick PN's. With the Tef f as above,\nwe obtain the dilution factor W(r) to be 10\u221213 \u2013 10\u221214 .\nAfter determining Tef f and W(r), the same method as used in NGC 6741 is applied to determine the electron\ndensity Ne of the [Fe VI] emission nebula in IC 351, and possible errors in the observed line intensities. There are 7\nobservational line ratios for IC 351 as shown in Figs. 3 and 4; but we calculated the same 8 line ratios theoretically\nas for NGC 6741. The only reported uncertainty for a line ratio given by Feibelman et al. (1996) is 36.6% for the pair\n5335/5146 (Fig. 3). When we look into the comparison of line ratios for IC 351 from Table 7 (pairs of line ratios with\ncommon upper level), we find that the agreement of 4973/5146 is good (\u2248 10%) between calculation and observation.\nThis establishes that the intensities of both the 4973 and 5146 \u00c5 lines should be highly accurate (\u2248 10%). The\ndiffierence is 26% for 5427/5677 (Fig. 4), 92% for 5335/5485 (Fig. 3), and 175% for 5278/5425 (Fig. 4). From these\ndifferences, and Figs. 3 and 4, we could estimate the possible errors in some of the observed lines: line 5485 \u00c5 should\nbe reduced by 60%; line 5336 \u00c5 increased by 20%; line 5278 \u00c5 reduced by 175%. The intensity of the line 5425 \u00c5 is\naccurate. From these 4 line ratios, Ne is determined to be \u2248 1,000 cm\u22123 . Using this Ne and Fig. 4, and the comparison\nof the line ratio 5427/5677 in Table 7, the possible errors in the intensities of the other 3 observed lines can be deduced\nas follows: line 5427 \u00c5 should be reduced by 80%; line 5677 \u00c5 reduced by 40%; and line 5177 \u00c5 increased by 20%.\nIn summary, the above error analysis is based on Table 7 and the theoretically computed line ratios reported in this\nwork (Figs. 3 and 4).\n4.4. NGC 7662\nFinally we apply our spectral diagnostics, and the same procedures used above, to NGC 7662. In this PN, the effective\ntemperature Tef f and emission region distance to the central star seem to have been determined within low uncertainties. Hence, we adopt here Tef f =105,000 K and W=10\u221214 (Hyung and Aller (1997b)) in our present calculation and\nthe results are shown in Figs. 5 and 6. However, the observational uncertainties in line intensities are even larger than\nthose in Feibelman et al. (1996) as shown from both the rms uncertainties given in Hyung and Aller (1997b) and our\ndetailed spectral analysis by using the method developed by Chen and Pradhan (2000). The more complex problem is\nthat our reference line 5146 \u00c5 has very large observational uncertainty in NGC 7662, in contrast to NGC 6741 or IC\n351. Therefore we need to determine the uncertainty of this reference line first, before the general spectral diagonosis\nof NGC 7662 including Ne can proceed.\nThat the uncertainty in observational intensity of line 5146 \u00c5 is large can be established from the comparison\nof the physical-condition-independent line ratio 4973/5146 shown in Table 7 for NGC 7662. We also have some supplemental evidence to support this conclusion. First, after some analysis, we find the observed intensity of line 5425\n\u00c5 to be very accurate; at most it is too high by 5-10%. This is also consistent with the rms uncertainty given by\nHyung and Aller (1997b), which is remarkbly low at 3.9%. Second, we could establish that the observed intensities for\nlines 5335 and 5177 \u00c5 are also very accurate (within 10%) by using our procedures as described above. It is very likely\nthat only the 5335 \u00c5 line intensity needs to be increased by 5%, and the line 5177 \u00c5 intensity decreased by 5%. To\nfurther confirm our justification, we plot a new line ratio 5177/5335 in Fig. 7, which the leads to a reasonable determination of Ne . In all the above arguments, we have a consistent spectral analysis from the line ratios of 5335/5146,\n5177/5146 and 5425/5146 as shown in Figs. 5 and 6, as well as the line ratio 5177/5335 in Fig. 7. As such, we conclude\nthat: (1) the observed intensity of line 5146 should be inreased by 80%. (the rms given in Hyung and Aller (1997b) is\n21.7%); (2) the electron density of the [Fe VI] emission region is Ne \u22483,000 cm\u22123 . For this PN, we can then deduce the\npossible observational errors in the other lines comparing the line ratios 5335/5485 and 5425/5631 shown in Table 7.\nWe find that the observed intensity of the line 5485 \u00c5 should be decreased by 35%; and that of line 5631 \u00c5 increased\nby 60%. Finally, to make the observational line ratio 5677/5146 consistent with the physical conditions including Ne\ndetermined above by all the other line ratios, the observed intensity of the line 5677 \u00c5 should be increased by 110%\n(the rms uncertainty given by Hyung and Aller (1997b) is 20.3%).\n5. Conclusion and discussion\nAn extensive calculation of fine structure transition probabilities of Fe VI is presented for the allowed E1 and the\nforbidden E2, M 1 transitions. An indication of the uncertainties in the computed gf-values is given in the plot of\n\n\f8\n\nGuo Xin Chen and Anil K. Pradhan: Atomic data from the Iron Project\n\nlength gfL vs. the velocity gfV for 867 E1 transitions computed in this work (Fig. 8). It shows an agreement at about\n10% level for most of the transitions, with no more than about 5% of the transitions lying outside that range even for\ngf-values less than 10\u22124 .\nCombined with previously calculated data for electron impact excitation, a 80-level CR spectral model for line\nratios diagnostics is used to predict the effect of collisional and fluorescent excitation (FLE) in planetary nebulae. An\nillustrative and limited analysis of line ratios is carried out as an example of the use of the atomic data and the model\nproposed herein. Some of the diagnostics procedures developed earlier by Chen and Pradhan (2000, CP00) are employed\nto analyse observed line intensties from three planetary nebulae: NGC 6741, IC 351 and NGC 7662. The detailed model\nand analysis yields a consistent set of diagnostics, for example, for the electron density and effective temperature of\nthe source. It shows that fluorescence effects should be included in CR models of these objects. The method may be\nused to determine the physical conditions in PN, especially when it is difficult to do so by other methods. For example,\nwe have determined, within certain error limits, both the effective temperature and the emission region distance (via\na dilution factor) for IC 351. By combining the line ratios that are independent of the physical conditions of PN (like\ncases in Table 5), and our method, we are able to estimate possible errors in the observed intensities, both individually\nand in term of consistency among the set of observed lines. It is expected that the method and procedures described\nin this paper would be generally applicable to spectral diagnostis of other radiative plasma sources, such as novae and\nAGN.\nFinally, some possible uncertainties in our model and procedure, as employed in the present calculations, are as\nfollows. 1) Static conditions are assumed in the CR model, independent of photoionization eqilibrium in the [Fe VI]\nregions of PN's. Because [Fe VI] region is almost the highest ionization state in PN's considered here, this assumption\nshould not carry a large uncertainty. 2) We have assumed inherently in our procedures that there are nearly constant\nNe and Te in [Fe VI] regions. This assumption is not entirely true because both Ne and Te are a function of the\ndistance from the central star to the [Fe VI] emission region. However, according to 1), if photoionization equilibrium\nprevails then there should not be large variations in Ne and Te. 3) The radiation field should in principle simulate\nthe ionizing stellar radiation. A further refinement of the model proposed herein would be (a) to include a radiation\nfield with proper allowance for the Helium and Hydrogen opacities in various ionization and excitation steps, and\n(b) in addition to the radiation flux from the central star, resonance fluorescence from H I and He II Ly\u03b1 should be\nconsidered in the model. However as noted earlier, Fe VI is likely to be in the fully ionized He III zone, and therefore\nnot greatly susceptible to the effects. 4) Even though the most advanced R-matrix codes are employed in generating\natomic data, the atomic data still have some uncertainties, estimated at about 10\u201320%.\nAll data tables are available electronically from the CDS, or via ftp from the authors at: chen@astronomy.ohiostate.edu.\nAcknowledgements.
