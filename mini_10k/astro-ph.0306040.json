KOCHANEK\nHarvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics\n\nPAUL L. SCHECHTER\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nAbstract\nThere are now 10 firm time delay measurements in gravitational lenses. The physics of time\ndelays is well understood, and the only important variable for interpreting the time delays\nto determine H0 is the mean surface mass density h\u03bai (in units of the critical density for\ngravitational lensing) of the lens galaxy at the radius of the lensed images. More centrally\nconcentrated mass distributions with lower h\u03bai predict higher Hubble constants, with H0 \u221d\n1 \u2212 h\u03bai to lowest order. While we cannot determine h\u03bai directly given the available data\non the current time delay lenses, we find H0 = 48 \u00b1 3 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 for the isothermal\n(flat rotation curve) models, which are our best present estimate for the mass distributions\nof the lens galaxies. Only if we eliminate the dark matter halo of the lenses and use a\nconstant mass-to-light ratio (M/L) model to find H0 = 71 \u00b1 3 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 is the result\nconsistent with local estimates. Measurements of time delays in better-constrained systems\nor observations to obtain new constraints on the current systems provide a clear path to\neliminating the h\u03bai degeneracy and making estimates of H0 with smaller uncertainties than\nare possible locally. Independent of the value of H0 , the time delay lenses provide a new and\nunique probe of the dark matter distributions of galaxies and clusters because they measure\nthe total (light + dark) matter surface density.\n\n1.1\n\nIntroduction\n\nFifteen years prior to their discovery in 1979, Refsdal (1964) outlined how gravitationally lensed quasars might be used to determine the Hubble constant. Astronomers have\nspent the quarter century since their discovery working out the difficult details not considered in Refsdal's seminal papers.\nThe difficulties encountered fall into two broad categories - measurement and modeling.\nTime delays can be hard to measure if the fluxes of the images do not vary, or if the images\nare faint, or if they lie very close to each other. Modeling gravitational potentials with a small\nnumber of constraints is likewise difficult, either because the lens geometry is complex or\nbecause the data poorly constrain the most important aspects of the gravitational potential.\nWe will argue that these difficulties are surmountable, both in principle and in practice, and\nthat an effort considerably smaller than that of the HST Hubble Constant Key Project will\nyield a considerably smaller uncertainty in the Hubble constant, H0 .\nWhile the number of systems with measured time delays is small, their interpretation im1\n\n\fC. S. Kochanek and P. L. Schechter\nplies a value for H0 , which, given our current understanding of the dark matter distributions\nof galaxies, is formally inconsistent with that obtained using Cepheids. The Key Project\nvalue of H0 = 72 \u00b1 8 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 (Freedman et al. 2001) is consistent with the lens data\nonly if the lens galaxies have significantly less dark matter than is expected theoretically or\nhas been measured for other early-type galaxies. While it is premature to argue for replacing\nthe local estimates, we hope to persuade the astronomical community that the time delay\nresult deserves both careful attention and further study.\nInterpreting time delays requires a model for the gravitational potential of the lens, and\nin most cases the uncertainties in the model dominate the uncertainty in H0 . Thus, the\nmain focus of this review will be to explain the dependence of time delays on gravitational\npotentials. We start in \u00a71.2 by introducing the time delay method and illustrating the physics\nof time delays with a series of simple models. In \u00a71.3 we review a general mathematical\ntheory of time delays to show that, for most lenses, the only important parameter of the\nmodel is the mean surface density of the lens at the radius of the images. In \u00a71.4 we discuss\nthe effects of the environment of the lens on time delays. We review the data on the time\ndelay lenses in \u00a71.5 and their implications for the Hubble constant and dark matter in earlytype galaxies in \u00a71.6. The present time delay lenses have a degeneracy between H0 and\nthe amount of dark matter, so in \u00a71.7 we outline several approaches that can eliminate the\ndegeneracy. Finally, in \u00a71.8 we discuss the future of time delays. Unless otherwise stated,\nwe assume a flat, \u03a9m = 0.3, \u03a9\u039b = 0.7 cosmological model.\n\n1.2\n\nTime Delay Basics\n\nThe observations of gravitationally lensed quasars are best understood in light of\nFermat's principle (e.g., Blandford & Narayan 1986). Intervening mass between a source\nand an observer introduces an effective index of refraction, thereby increasing the lighttravel time. The competition between this Shapiro delay from the gravitational field and the\ngeometric delay due to bending the ray paths leads to the formation of multiple images at the\nstationary points (minima, maxima, and saddle points) of the travel time (for more complete\nreviews, see Narayan & Bartelmann 1999 or Schneider, Ehlers, & Falco 1992).\nAs with glass optics, there is a thin-lens approximation that applies when the optics are\nsmall compared to the distances to the source and the observer.\nIn this approximation, we\nR\nneed only the effective potential, \u03c8(~x) = (2/c2 )(Dls /Ds ) dz\u03c6, found by integrating the 3D\npotential \u03c6 along the line of sight. The light-travel time is\n\u0015\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0015\u0014\n\u0014\n1 + zl Dl Ds 1 \u0010 ~ \u00112\n~x \u2212 \u03b2 \u2212 \u03c8 (~x) ,\n(1.1)\n\u03c4 (~x) =\nc\nDls\n2\nwhere ~x = (x, y) = R(cos\u03b8, sin \u03b8) and \u03b2~ are the angular positions of the image and the source,\n~ 2 /2 is the geometric delay in the small-angle approx\u03c8(~x) is the effective potential, (~x \u2212 \u03b2)\nimation, zl is the lens redshift, and Dl , Ds , and Dls are angular-diameter distances to the\nlens, to the source, and from the lens to the source, respectively. The only dimensioned\nquantity in the travel time is a factor of H0\u22121 \u2243 10h\u22121 Gyr arising from the H0\u22121 scaling of the\nangular-diameter distances.\nWe observe the images at the extrema of the time delay function, which we find by setting\n~ x \u03c4 = 0, and finding all the\nthe gradients with respect to the image positions equal to zero, \u2207\n~ The local magnificastationary points (~xA , ~xB , * * *) associated with a given source position \u03b2.\n2\n\n\fC.

S. Kochanek and P. L.

The SIS model suggests that lens time delay measurements reduce\nthe determination of the Hubble constant to a problem of differential astrometry. This is\nalmost correct, but we have made two idealizations in using the SIS model.\nThe first idealization was to ignore deviations of the radial (monopole) density profile\nfrom that of an SIS with density \u03c1 \u221d r\u22122 , surface density \u03a3 \u221d R\u22121 , and a flat rotation curve.\nThe SIS is a special case of a power-law monopole with lens potential\n\u0012 \u00133\u2212\u03b7\nR\nb2\n,\n(1.5)\n\u03c8(~x) =\n(3 \u2212 \u03b7) b\ncorresponding to a (3D) density distribution with density \u03c1 \u221d r\u2212\u03b7 , surface density \u03a3 \u221d R1\u2212\u03b7 ,\nand rotation curve \u03c5c \u221d r(2\u2212\u03b7)/2 . For \u03b7 = 2 we recover the SIS model, and the normalization is\nchosen so that the scale b is always the Einstein ring radius. Models with smaller (larger) \u03b7\nhave less (more) centrally concentrated mass distributions and have rising (falling) rotation\ncurves. The limit \u03b7 \u2192 3 approaches the potential of a point mass.

Unfortunately, the systematic errors created by\nmilli- and microlensing make it difficult to use flux ratios as model constraints (see \u00a71.5).\n\n\u2217\n\n4\n\n\fC. S. Kochanek and P. L. Schechter\n(1) Image astrometry of simple two-image and four-image lenses generally cannot constrain the\nradial mass distribution of the lens.\n(2) More centrally concentrated mass distributions (larger \u03b7) predict longer time delays, resulting in a larger Hubble constant for a given time delay measurement.\n\nThese problems, which we will address from a different perspective in \u00a71.3, are the cause of\nthe uncertainties in estimates of H0 from time delays.\nThe second idealization was to ignore deviations from circular symmetry due to either the\nellipticity of the lens galaxy or the local tidal gravity field from nearby objects. A very nice\nanalytic example of a lens with angular structure is a singular isothermal model with arbitrary angular structure, where the effective potential is \u03c8 = bRF(\u03b8), and F(\u03b8) is an arbitrary\nfunction. The model family includes the most common lens model, the singular isothermal\nellipsoid (SIE). The time delays for this model family are simply \u2206tSIS , independent of the\nangular structure of the lens (Witt et al. 2000)! This result, while attractive, does not hold in\ngeneral, and we will require the results of \u00a71.3 to understand the effects of angular structure\nin the potential.\n\n1.3\n\nUnderstanding Time Delays: A General Theory\n\nThe need to model the gravitational potential of the lens is the aspect of interpreting\ntime delays that creates the greatest suspicion. The most extreme view is that it renders the\nproject \"hopeless\" because we will never be able to guarantee that the models encompass the\ndegrees of freedom needed to capture all the systematic uncertainties. In order to address\nthese fears we must show that we understand the specific properties of the gravitational\npotential determining time delays and then ensure that our parameterized models include\nthese degrees of freedom.\nThe examples we considered in \u00a71.2 illustrate the basic physics of time delays, but an\nextensive catalog of (non)parametric models demonstrating the same properties may not be\nconvincing to the skeptic. We will instead show, using standard mathematical expansions\nof the potential, which properties of the lens galaxy are required to understand time delays\nwith accuracies of a few percent. While we can understand the results of all models for the\ntime delays of gravitational lenses based on this simple theory, full numerical models should\nprobably be used for most detailed, quantitative analyses. Fortunately, there are publically\navailable programs for both the parametric and nonparametric approaches.\u2217 Our analysis\nuses the geometry of the schematic lens shown in Figure 1.1. The two images define an\nannulus bounded by their radii, RA and RB , and with an interior region for R < RB and an\nexterior region for R > RA .\nThe key to understanding time delays comes from Gorenstein, Falco, & Shapiro (1988;\nsee also Saha 2000), who showed that the time delay of a circular lens depends only on\nthe image positions and the surface density \u03ba(R) in the annulus between the images. The\nmass of the interior region is implicit in the image positions and accurately determined by\nthe astrometry. From Gauss' law, we know that the radial distribution of the mass in the\ninterior region and the amount or distribution of mass in the exterior region is irrelevant.\nA useful approximation is to assume that the surface density in the annulus can be locally\n\u2217\n\nThe gravlens and lensmodel (Keeton 2003, cfa-www.harvard.edu/\u223ccastles) packages include a very broad range\nof parametric models for the mass distributions of lenses, and the PixelLens package (Williams & Saha 2000,\nankh-morpork.maths.qmw.ac.uk/\u223csaha/astron/lens/pix/) implements a nonparametric approach.\n\n5\n\n\fC. S. Kochanek and P. L. Schechter\napproximated by a power law \u03ba \u221d R1\u2212\u03b7 and that the mean surface density in the annulus is\nh\u03bai = h\u03a3i/\u03a3c . The time delay between the images is (Kochanek 2002)\n\"\n\u0012\n\u00132\n\u00134 !#\n\u0012\n\u2206R\n1 \u2212 \u03b7h\u03bai \u2206R\n.\n(1.7)\n+O\n\u2206t = 2\u2206tSIS 1 \u2212 h\u03bai \u2212\n12\nhRi\nhRi\nThus, the time delay is largely determined by the average density h\u03bai, with only modest\ncorrections from the local shape of the surface density distribution even when \u2206R/hRi \u2243\n1. For example, the second-order expansion is exact for an SIS lens (h\u03bai = 1/2, \u03b7 = 2)\nand reproduces the time delay of a point mass lens (h\u03bai = 0) to better than 1% even when\n\u2206R/hRi = 1. This local model also explains the time delay scalings of the global power-law\nmodels we discussed in \u00a71.2. A \u03c1 \u221d r\u2212\u03b7 global power law has surface density h\u03bai = (3 \u2212 \u03b7)/2\nnear the Einstein ring, so the leading term of the time delay is \u2206t = 2\u2206tSIS (1 \u2212 h\u03bai) = (\u03b7 \u2212\n1)\u2206tSIS , just as in Equation (1.6).\n\u2022 The time delay is not determined by the global structure of the radial density profile but\nrather by the surface density near the Einstein ring.\n\nGorenstein et al. (1988) considered only circular lenses, but a multipole expansion allows\nus to understand the role of angular structure (Kochanek 2002). An estimate to the same\norder as in Equation (1.7) requires only the quadrupole moments of the regions interior\nand exterior to the annulus, provided the strengths of the higher-order multipoles of the\npotential have the same order of magnitude as for an ellipsoidal density distribution.\u2217 This\napproximation can fail for the lenses in clusters (see \u00a71.4). The complete expansion for\n\u2206t when the two quadrupole moments have independent amplitudes and orientations is not\nvery informative. However, the leading term of the expansion when the two quadrupole\nmoments are aligned illustrates the role of angular structure. Given an exterior quadrupole\n(i.e., an external shear) of amplitude \u03b3ext and an interior quadrupole of amplitude \u03b3int sharing\na common axis \u03b8\u03b3 , the quadrupole potential is\n\u0012\n\u0013\nhRi4\n1\n2\n\u03b3ext R + \u03b3int 2 cos 2(\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8\u03b3 )\n(1.8)\n\u03c82 =\n2\nR\nif we define the amplitudes at radius hRi. For images at positions RA (cos \u03b8A , sin \u03b8A ) and\nRB (cos\u03b8B , sin \u03b8B ) relative to the lens galaxy (see Fig. 1.1), the leading term of the time delay\nis\n\u2206t \u2243 2\u2206tSIS (1 \u2212 h\u03bai)\n\nsin2 (\u2206\u03b8AB /2)\n,\n1 \u2212 4 fint cos2 (\u2206\u03b8AB /2)\n\n(1.9)\n\nwhere \u2206\u03b8AB = \u03b8A \u2212 \u03b8B and fint = \u03b3int /(\u03b3ext + \u03b3int ) is the fraction of the quadrupole due to\nthe interior quadrupole moment \u03b3int . We need not worry about the possibility of a singular\ndenominator - successful global models of the lens do not allow such configurations.\n\u2217\n\nIf the quadrupole potential, \u03c82 \u221d cos 2\u03b8, has dimensionless amplitude \u01eb2 , then it produces ray deflections of\norder O(\u01eb2 b) at the Einstein ring of the lens. In a four-image lens the quadrupole deflections are comparable\nto the thickness of the annulus, so \u01eb2 \u2243 \u2206R/hRi. In a two-image lens they are smaller than the thickness of\n< \u2206R/hRi. For an ellipsoidal density distribution, the cos(2m\u03b8) multipole amplitude scales\nthe annulus, so \u01eb2 \u223c\nm\n<\nas \u01eb2m \u223c \u01ebm\n2 \u223c (\u2206R/hRi) . This allows us to ignore the quadrupole density distribution in the annulus and all\nhigher-order multipoles. It is important to remember that potentials are much rounder than surface densities\n[with relative amplitudes for a cos(m\u03b8) multipole of roughly m\u22122 :m\u22121 :1 for potentials:deflections:densities], so\nthe multipoles relevant to time delays converge rapidly even for very flat surface density distributions.\n\n6\n\n\fC. S. Kochanek and P. L. Schechter\nA two-image lens has too few astrometric constraints to fully constrain a model with\nindependent, misaligned internal and external quadrupoles. Fortunately, when the lensed\nimages lie on opposite sides of the lens galaxy (\u2206\u03b8AB \u2243 \u03c0 + \u03b4, |\u03b4| \u226a 1), the time delay\nbecomes insensitive to the quadrupole structure. Provided the angular deflections are smaller\nthan the radial deflections (|\u03b4|hRi <\n\u223c \u2206R), the leading term of the time delay reduces to the\nresult for a circular lens, \u2206t \u2243 2\u2206tSIS (1 \u2212 h\u03bai). There is, however, one limiting case to\nremember. If the images and the lens are colinear, as in a spherical lens, the component of\nthe shear aligned with the separation vector acts like a contribution to the convergence. In\nmost lenses this would be a modest additional uncertainty - in the typical lens these shears\nmust be small, the sign of the effect should be nearly random, and it is only a true degeneracy\nin the limit that everything is colinear.\nA four-image lens has more astrometric constraints and can constrain a model with independent, misaligned internal and external quadrupoles. The quadrupole moments of the\nobserved lenses are dominated by external shear, with fint <\n\u223c 1/4 unless there is more than\none lens galaxy inside the Einstein ring. The ability of the astrometry to constrain fint is\nimportant because the delays depend strongly on fint when the images do not lie on opposite\nsides of the galaxy. If external shears dominate, fint \u2243 0 and the leading term of the delay\nbecomes \u2206t \u2243 2\u2206tSIS (1 \u2212 h\u03bai) sin2 \u2206\u03b8AB /2. If the model is isothermal, like the \u03c8 = rF(\u03b8)\nmodels we considered in \u00a71.2, then fint = 1/4 and we again find that the delay is independent of the angle, with \u2206t \u2243 2\u2206tSIS (1 \u2212 h\u03bai). The time delay ratios in a four-image lens are\nlargely determined by the angular structure and provide a check of the potential model.\nIn summary, if we want to understand time delays to an accuracy competitive with studies\nof the local distance scale (5%\u201310%), the only important variable is the surface density h\u03bai\nof the lens in the annulus between the images. When models based on the same data for the\ntime delay and the image positions predict different values for H0 , the differences can always\nbe understood as the consequence of different choices for h\u03bai. In parametric models h\u03bai is\nadjusted by changing the central concentration of the lens (i.e., like \u03b7 in the global power-law\nmodels), and in the nonparametric models of Williams & Saha (2000) it is adjusted directly.\nThe expansion models of Zhao & Qin (2003a,b) mix aspects of both approaches.\n\n1.4\n\nLenses Within Clusters\n\nMost galaxies are not isolated, and many early-type lens galaxies are members of\ngroups or clusters, so we need to consider the effects of the local environment on the time\ndelays. Weak perturbations are easily understood since they will simply be additional contributions to the surface density (h\u03bai) and the external shear/quadrupole (\u03b3ext ) we discussed\nin \u00a71.3. In this section we focus on the consequences of large perturbations.\nAs a first approximation we can assume that a nearby cluster (or galaxy) can be modeled\nby an SIS potential, \u03a8c (~x) = B|~x \u2212 ~xc |, where B is the Einstein radius of the cluster and\n~xc = RC (cos\u03b8c , sin \u03b8c ) is the position of the cluster relative to the primary lens. We can\nunderstand its effects by expanding the potential as a series in R/Rc , dropping constant\nand linear terms that have no observable consequences, to find that\n\u0013\n\u0012\nB 3\n1 B 2 1 B 2\n(1.10)\nR \u2212\nR cos 2(\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8c) + O\nR .\n\u03a8c \u2243\n4 Rc\n4 Rc\nR2c\nThe first term has the form (1/2)\u03bacR2 , which is the potential of a uniform sheet whose\nsurface density \u03bac = B/2Rc is that of the cluster at the lens center. The second term has the\n7\n\n\fC. S. Kochanek and P. L. Schechter\nform (1/2)\u03b3cR2 cos 2(\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8c ), which is the (external) tidal shear \u03b3c = B/2Rc that would be\nproduced by putting all the cluster mass inside a ring of radius Rc at the cluster center. All\nrealistic lens models need to incorporate a tidal shear term due to objects near the lens or\nalong the line of sight (Keeton, Kochanek, & Seljak 1997), but as we discussed in \u00a71.3 the\nshear does not lead to significant ambiguities in the time delay estimates. Usually the local\nshear cannot be associated with a particular object unless it is quite strong (\u03b3c \u2248 0.1).\u2217\nThe problems with nearby objects arise when the convergence \u03bac becomes large because\nof a global degeneracy known as the mass-sheet degeneracy (Falco, Gorenstein, & Shapiro\n1985). If we have a model predicting a time delay \u2206t0 and then add a sheet of constant\nsurface density \u03bac , then the time delay is changed to (1 \u2212 \u03bac)\u2206t0 without changing the image\npositions, flux ratios, or time delay ratios. Its effects can be understood from \u00a71.3 as a\ncontribution to the annular surface density with h\u03bai = \u03bac and \u03b7 = 1. The parameters of the\nlens, in particular the mass scale b, are also rescaled by factors of 1 \u2212 \u03bac , so the degeneracy\ncan be broken if there is an independent mass estimate for either the cluster or the galaxy.\u2217\nWhen the convergence is due to an object like a cluster, there is a strong correlation between\nthe convergence \u03bac and the shear \u03b3c that is controlled by the density distribution of the cluster\n(for our isothermal model \u03bac = \u03b3c ). In most circumstances, neglecting the extra surface\ndensity coming from nearby objects (galaxies, groups, clusters) leads to an overestimate of\nthe Hubble constant because these objects all have \u03bac > 0.\nIf the cluster is sufficiently close, then we cannot ignore the higher-order perturbations\nin the expansion of Equation (1.10). They are quantitatively important when they produce\ndeflections at the Einstein ring radius b of the primary lens, B(b/Rc)2 , that are larger than\nthe astrometric uncertainties. Because these uncertainties are small, the higher-order terms\nquickly become important. If they are important but ignored in the models, the results can\nbe very misleading.\n\n1.5\n\nObserving Time Delays and Time Delay Lenses\n\nThe first time delay measurement, for the gravitational lens Q0957+561, was reported in 1984 (Florentin-Nielsen 1984). Unfortunately, a controversy then developed between a short delay (\u2243 1.1 years, Schild & Cholfin 1986; Vanderriest et al. 1989) and a\nlong delay (\u2243 1.5 years, Press, Rybicki, & Hewitt 1992a,b), which was finally settled in\nfavor of the short delay only after 5 more years of effort (Kundi\u0107 et al. 1997; also Schild &\nThomson 1997 and Haarsma et al. 1999). Factors contributing to the intervening difficulties\nincluded the small amplitude of the variations, systematic effects, which, with hindsight, appear to be due to microlensing and scheduling difficulties (both technical and sociological).\nWhile the long-running controversy over Q0957+561 led to poor publicity for the mea\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\nThere is a small random component of \u03ba contributed by material along the line of sight (Barkana 1996). This\nintroduces small uncertainties in the H0 estimates for individual lenses (an rms convergence of 0.01 \u2212 0.05,\ndepending on the source redshift), but is an unimportant source of uncertainty in estimates from ensembles of\nlenses because it is a random variable that averages to zero.\nFor the cluster this can be done using weak lensing (e.g., Fischer et al. 1997 in Q0957+561), cluster galaxy\nvelocity dispersions (e.g., Angonin-Willaime, Soucail, & Vanderriest 1994 for Q0957+561, Hjorth et al. 2002\nfor RXJ0911+0551) or X-ray temperatures/luminosities (e.g., Morgan et al. 2001 for RXJ0911+0551 or Chartas\net al. 2002 for Q0957+561). For the lens galaxy this can be done with stellar dynamics (Romanowsky &\nKochanek 1999 for Q0957+561 and PG1115+080, Treu & Koopmans 2002b for PG1115+080). The accuracy\nof these methods is uncertain at present because each suffers from its own systematic uncertainties. When the\nlens is in the outskirts of a cluster, as in RXJ0911+0551, it is probably reasonable to assume that \u03bac \u2264 \u03b3c , as\nmost mass distributions are more centrally concentrated than isothermal.\n\n8\n\n\fC.

Figure 1.2 shows an example, the beautiful light curves from the\nradio lens B1608+656 by Fassnacht et al. (2002), where the variations of all four lensed\nimages have been traced for over three years. One of the 11 systems, B1422+231, is limited by systematic uncertainties in the delay measurements. The brand new time delay for\nHE1104\u20131805 (Ofek & Maoz 2003) is probably accurate, but has yet to be interpreted in\ndetail.\nWe want to have uncertainties in the time delay measurements that are unimportant\nfor the estimates of H0 . For the present, uncertainties of order 3%\u20135% are adequate (so\nimproved delays are still needed for PG1115+080, HE2149\u20132745, and PKS1830\u2013211).\nIn a four-image lens we can measure three independent time delays, and the dimensionless ratios of these delays provide additional constraints on the lens models (see \u00a71.3).\nThese ratios are well measured in B1608+656 (Fassnacht et al. 2002), poorly measured\nin PG1115+080 (Barkana 1997; Schechter et al. 1997; Chartas 2003) and unmeasured in\neither RXJ0911+0551 or B1422+231. Using the time delay lenses as very precise probes\nof H0 , dark matter and cosmology will eventually require still smaller delay uncertainties\n(\u223c 1%). Once a delay is known to 5%, it is relatively easy to reduce the uncertainties further\nbecause we can accurately predict when flux variations will appear in the other images and\nneed to be monitored.\nThe expression for the time delay in an SIS lens (Eqn. 1.4) reveals the other data that are\nnecessary to interpret time delays. First, the source and lens redshifts are needed to compute\nthe distance factors that set the scale of the time delays. Fortunately, we know both redshifts\nfor all 11 systems in Table 1.1. The dependence of the angular-diameter distances on the\n10\n\n\fC. S. Kochanek and P. L. Schechter\ncosmological model is unimportant until our total uncertainties approach 5% (see \u00a71.8).\nSecond, we require accurate relative positions for the images and the lens galaxy. These\nuncertainties are always dominated by the position of the lens galaxy relative to the images.\nFor most of the lenses in Table 1.1, observations with radio interferometers (VLA, Merlin,\nVLBA) and HST have measured the relative positions of the images and lenses to accuracies\n< 0.\u2032\u2032 005. Sufficiently deep HST images can obtain the necessary data for almost any lens,\n\u223c\nbut dust in the lens galaxy (as seen in B1600+434 and B1608+656) can limit the accuracy of\nthe measurement even in a very deep image. For B0218+357 and PKS1830\u2013211, however,\nthe position of the lens galaxy relative to the images is not known to sufficient precision or\nis disputed (see L\u00e9har et al. 2000; Courbin et al. 2002; Winn et al. 2002).\nIn practice, we fit models of the gravitational potential constrained by the available data\non the image and lens positions, the relative image fluxes, and the relative time delays.\nWhen imposing these constraints, it is important to realize that lens galaxies are not perfectly smooth. They contain both low-mass satellites and stars that perturb the gravitational\npotential. The time delays themselves are completely unaffected by these substructures.\nHowever, as we take derivatives of the potential to determine the ray deflections or the\nmagnification, the sensitivity to substructures in the lens galaxy grows. Models of substructure in cold dark matter (CDM) halos predict that the substructure produces random\nperturbations of approximately 0.\u2032\u2032 001 in the image positions (see Metcalf & Madau 2001;\nDalal & Kochanek 2002). We should not impose tighter astrometric constraints than this\nlimit. A more serious problem is that substructure, whether satellites (\"millilensing\") or\nstars (\"microlensing\"), significantly affect image fluxes with amplitudes that depend on the\nimage magnification and parity (see, e.g., Wozniak et al. 2000; Burud et al. 2002b; Dalal &\nKochanek 2002; Schechter et al. 2003 or Schechter & Wambsganss 2002). Once the flux\nerrors are enlarged to the 30% level of these systematic errors, they provide little leverage\nfor discriminating between models.\nWe can also divide the systems by the complexity of the required lens model. We define\neight of the lenses as \"simple,\" in the sense that the available data suggests that a model\nconsisting of a single primary lens in a perturbing shear (tidal gravity) field should be an\nadequate representation of the gravitational potential. In some of these cases, an external\npotential representing a nearby galaxy or parent group will improve the fits, but the differences between the tidal model and the more complicated perturbing potential are small (see\n\u00a71.4). We include the quotation marks because the classification is based on an impression\nof the systems from the available data and models. While we cannot guarantee that a system is simple, we can easily recognize two complications that will require more complex\nmodels.\nThe first complication is that some primary lenses have less massive satellite galaxies inside or near their Einstein rings. This includes two of the time delay lenses, RXJ0911+0551\nand B1608+656. RXJ0911+0551 could simply be a projection effect, since neither lens\ngalaxy shows irregular isophotes. Here the implication for models may simply be the need\nto include all the parameters (mass, position, ellipticity * * *) required to describe the second lens galaxy, and with more parameters we would expect greater uncertainties in H0 .\nIn B1608+656, however, the lens galaxies show the heavily disturbed isophotes typical of\ngalaxies undergoing a disruptive interaction. How one should model such a system is unclear. If there was once dark matter associated with each of the galaxies, how is it distributed\nnow? Is it still associated with the individual galaxies? Has it settled into an equilibrium\n11\n\n\fC. S. Kochanek and P. L. Schechter\nconfiguration? While B1608+656 can be well fit with standard lens models (Fassnacht et\nal. 2002), these complications have yet to be explored.\nThe second complication occurs when the primary lens is a member of a more massive (Xray) cluster, as in the time delay lenses RXJ0911+0551 (Morgan et al. 2001) and Q0957+561\n(Chartas et al. 2002). The cluster model is critical to interpreting these systems (see \u00a71.4).\nThe cluster surface density at the position of the lens (\u03bac >\n\u223c 0.2) leads to large corrections\nto the time delay estimates and the higher-order perturbations are crucial to obtaining a\ngood model. For example, models in which the Q0957+561 cluster was treated simply as\nan external shear are grossly incorrect (see the review of Q0957+561 models in Keeton et\nal. 2000). In addition to the uncertainties in the cluster model itself, we must also decide\nhow to include and model the other cluster galaxies near the primary lens. Thus, lenses in\nclusters have many reasonable degrees of freedom beyond those of the \"simple\" lenses.\n\n1.6\n\nResults: The Hubble Constant and Dark Matter\n\nWith our understanding of the theory and observations of the lenses we will now explore their implications for H0 . We focus on the \"simple\" lenses PG1115+080, SBS1520+530,\nB1600+434, and HE2149\u20132745. We only comment on the interpretation of the HE1104\u2013\n1805 delay because the measurement is too recent to have been interpreted carefully. We will\nbriefly discuss the more complicated systems RXJ0911+0551, Q0957+561, and B1608+656,\nand we will not discuss the systems with problematic time delays or astrometry.\nThe most common, simple, realistic model of a lens consists of a singular isothermal\nellipsoid (SIE) in an external (tidal) shear field (Keeton et al. 1997). The model has 7\nparameters (the lens position, mass, ellipticity, major axis orientation for the SIE, and the\nshear amplitude and orientation). It has many degrees of freedom associated with the angular structure of the potential, but the radial structure is fixed with h\u03bai \u2243 1/2. For comparison,\na two-image (four-image) lens supplies 5 (13) constraints on any model of the potential: 2\n(6) from the relative positions of the images, 1 (3) from the flux ratios of the images, 0 (2)\nfrom the inter-image time delay ratios, and 2 from the lens position. With the addition of extra components (satellites/clusters) for the more complex lenses, this basic model provides\na good fit to all the time delay lenses except Q0957+561. Although a naive counting of\nthe degrees of freedom (Ndo f = \u22122 and 6, respectively) suggests that estimates of H0 would\nbe underconstrained for two-image lenses and overconstrained for four-image lenses, the\nuncertainties are actually dominated by those of the time delay measurements and the astrometry in both cases. This is what we expect from \u00a71.3 - the model has no degrees of\nfreedom that change h\u03bai or \u03b7, so there will be little contribution to the uncertainties in H0\nfrom the model for the potential.\nIf we use a model that includes parameters to control the radial density profile (i.e., h\u03bai),\nfor example by adding a halo truncation radius a to the SIS profile [the pseudo-Jaffe model,\n\u03c1 \u221d r\u22122 (r2 + a2 )\u22121 ; e.g., Impey et al. 1998; Burud et al. 2002a],\u2217 then we find the expected\ncorrelation between a and H0 - as we make the halo more concentrated (smaller a), the\nestimate of H0 rises from the value for the SIS profile (h\u03bai = 1/2 as a \u2192 \u221e) to the value\nfor a point mass (h\u03bai = 0 as a \u2192 0), with the fastest changes occurring when a is similar to\nthe Einstein radius of the lens. We show an example of such a model for PG1115+080 in\nFigure 1.3. This case is somewhat more complicated than a pure pseudo-Jaffe model because\n\u2217\n\nThis is simply an example. The same behavior would be seen for any other parametric model in which the radial\ndensity profile can be adjusted.\n\n12\n\n\fC. S. Kochanek and P. L. Schechter\nthere is an additional contribution to the surface density from the group to which the lens\ngalaxy belongs. As long as the structure of the radial density profile is fixed (constant a), the\nuncertainties are again dominated by the uncertainties in the time delay. Unfortunately, the\ngoodness of fit, \u03c72 (a), shows too little dependence on a to determine H0 uniquely. In general,\ntwo-image lenses have too few constraints, and the extra constraints supplied by a fourimage lens constrain the angular structure rather than the radial structure of the potential.\nThis basic problem holds for all existing models of the current sample of time delay lenses.\nThe inability of the present time delay lenses to directly constrain the radial density profile is the major problem for using them to determine H0 . Fortunately, it is a consequence\nof the available data on the current sample rather than a fundamental limitation, as we discuss in the next section (\u00a71.7). It is, however, a simple trade-off \u2013 models with less dark\nmatter (lower h\u03bai, more centrally concentrated densities) produce higher Hubble constants\nthan those with more dark matter. We do have some theoretical limits on the value of h\u03bai.\nIn particular, we can be confident that the surface density is bounded by two limiting models. The mass distribution should not be more compact than the luminosity distribution, so\na constant mass-to-light ratio (M/L) model should set a lower limit on h\u03bai >\n\u223c h\u03baiM/L \u2243 0.2,\nand an upper limit on estimates of H0 . We are also confident that the typical lens should\nnot have a rising rotation curve at 1\u20132 optical effective radii from the center of the lens\ngalaxy. Thus, the SIS model is probably the least concentrated reasonable model, setting an\nupper bound on h\u03bai <\n\u223c h\u03baiSIS = 1/2, and a lower limit on estimates of H0 . Figure 1.4 shows\njoint estimates of H0 from the four simple lenses for these two limiting mass distributions\n(Kochanek 2003b). The results for the individual lenses are mutually consistent and are unchanged by the new 0.149 \u00b1 0.004 day delay for the A1 -A2 images in PG1115+080 (Chartas\n2003). For galaxies with isothermal profiles we find H0 = 48 \u00b1 3 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 , and for\ngalaxies with constant M/L we find H0 = 71 \u00b1 3 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 . While our best prior estimate for the mass distribution is the isothermal profile (see \u00a71.7), the lens galaxies would\nhave to have constant M/L to match Key Project estimate of H0 = 72 \u00b1 8 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121\n(Freedman et al. 2001).\nThe difference between these two limits is entirely explained by the differences in h\u03bai\nand \u03b7 between the SIS and constant M/L models. In fact, it is possible to reduce the H0\nestimates for each simple lens to an approximation formula, H0 = A(1 \u2212 h\u03bai) + Bh\u03bai(\u03b7 \u2212 1).\nThe coefficients, A and |B| \u2248 A/10, are derived from the image positions using the simple\ntheory from \u00a71.3. These approximations reproduce numerical results using ellipsoidal lens\nmodels to accuracies of 3 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 (Kochanek 2002). For example, in Figure 1.3\nwe also show the estimate of H0 computed based on the simple theory of \u00a71.3 and the\nannular surface density (h\u03bai) and slope (\u03b7) of the numerical models. The agreement with\nthe full numerical solutions is excellent, even though the numerical models include both the\nellipsoidal lens galaxy and a group. No matter what the mass distribution is, the five lenses\nPG1115+080, SBS1520+530, B1600+434, PKS1830\u2013211,\u2217 and HE2149\u20132745 have very\nsimilar dark matter halos. For a fixed slope \u03b7, the five systems are consistent with a common\nvalue for the surface density of\nh\u03bai = 1 \u2212 1.07h + 0.14(\u03b7\u2212 1)(1 \u2212 h) \u00b1 0.04\n\u2217\n\n(1.11)\n\nPKS1830\u2013211 is included based on the Winn et al. (2002) model of the HST imaging data as a single lens\ngalaxy. Courbin et al. (2002) prefer an interpretation with multiple lens galaxies which would invalidate the\nanalysis.\n\n13\n\n\fC. S.

The lens galaxy is modeled as a ellipsoidal pseudoJaffe model, \u03c1 \u221d r\u22122 (r2 + a2 )\u22121 , and the nearby group is modeled as an SIS. As the break\nradius a \u2192 \u221e the pseudo-Jaffe model becomes an SIS model, and as the break radius a \u2192 0\nit becomes a point mass. The heavy solid curve (hexact ) shows the dependence of H0 on the\nbreak radius for the exact, nonlinear fits of the model to the PG1115+080 data. The heavy\ndashed curve (hscaling ) is the value found using our simple theory (\u00a71.3) of time delays. The\nagreement of the exact and scaling solutions is typical. The light solid line shows the average\nsurface density h\u03bai in the annulus between the images, and the light dashed line shows the\ninverse of the logarithmic slope \u03b7 in the annulus. For an SIS model we would have h\u03bai = 1/2\nand \u03b7 \u22121 = 1/2, as shown by the horizontal line. When the break radius is large compared to\nthe Einstein radius (indicated by the vertical line), the surface density is slightly higher and\nthe slope is slightly shallower than for the SIS model because of the added surface density\nfrom the group. As we make the lens galaxy more compact by reducing the break radius,\nthe surface density decreases and the slope becomes steeper, leading to a rise in H0 . As\nthe galaxy becomes very compact, the surface density near the Einstein ring is dominated\nby the group rather than the galaxy, so the surface density approaches a constant and the\nlogarithmic slope approaches the value corresponding to a constant density sheet (\u03b7 = 1).\nwhere H0 = 100h km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 and there is an upper limit of \u03c3\u03ba <\n\u223c 0.07 on the intrinsic scatter of h\u03bai. Thus, time delay lenses provide a new window into the structure and homogeneity\nof dark matter halos, regardless of the actual value of H0 .\nThere is an enormous range of parametric models that can illustrate how the extent of\nthe halo affects h\u03bai and hence H0 - the pseudo-Jaffe model we used above is only one\n14\n\n\fC.

It is useful, however, to use a physically motivated model where the lens galaxy is\nembedded in a standard NFW (Navarro, Frenk, & White 1996) profile halo. The lens galaxy\nconsists of the baryons that have cooled to form stars, so the mass of the visible galaxy\ncan be parameterized using the cold baryon fraction fb,cold of the halo, and for these CDM\nhalo models the value of h\u03bai is controlled by the cold baryon fraction (Kochanek 2003a).\nA constant M/L model is the limit fb,cold \u2192 1 (with h\u03bai \u2243 0.2, \u03b7 \u2243 3). Since the baryonic\nmass fraction of a CDM halo should not exceed the global fraction of fb \u2243 0.15 \u00b1 0.05 (e.g.,\nWang, Tegmark, & Zaldarriaga 2002), we cannot use constant M/L models without also\nabandoning CDM. As we reduce fb,cold , we are adding mass to an extended halo around\nthe lens, leading to an increase in h\u03bai and a decrease in \u03b7. For fb,cold \u2243 0.02 the model\nclosely resembles the SIS model (h\u03bai \u2243 1/2, \u03b7 \u2243 2). If we reduce fb,cold further, the mass\ndistribution begins to approach that of the NFW halo without any cold baryons. Figure 1.5\nshows how h\u03bai and H0 depend on fb,cold for PG1115+080, SBS1520+530, B1600+434 and\nHE2149\u20132745. When fb,cold \u2243 0.02, the CDM models have parameters very similar to the\nSIS model, and we obtain a very similar estimate of H0 = 52 \u00b1 6 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 (95%\nconfidence). If all baryons cool, and fb,cold = fb , then we obtain H0 = 65 \u00b1 6 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121\n(95% confidence), which is still lower than the Key Project estimates.\nWe excluded the lenses requiring significantly more complicated models with multiple\nlens galaxies or very strong perturbations from clusters. If we have yet to reach a consensus\non the mass distribution of relatively isolated lenses, it seems premature to extend the dis15\n\n\fC. S. Kochanek and P. L.

The left panel shows 1 \u2212 h\u03bai for the \"simple\" lenses\n(PG1115+080, SBS1520+530, B1600+434, and HE2149\u20132745) as a function of the cold\nbaryon fraction fb,cold .

The vertical bands in the two\npanels show the lower bound on fb from local inventories and the upper bound from the\nCMB.\n\ncussion to still more complicated systems. We can, however, show that the clusters lenses\nrequire significant contributions to h\u03bai from the cluster in order to produce the same H0 as\nthe more isolated systems. As we discussed in \u00a71.5 the three more complex systems are\nRXJ0911+0551, Q0957+561 and B1608+656.\nRXJ0911+0551 is very strongly perturbed by the nearby X-ray cluster (Morgan et al. 2001;\nHjorth et al. 2002). Kochanek (2003b) found H0 = 49 \u00b1 5 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 if the primary lens\nand its satellite were isothermal and H0 = 67 \u00b1 5 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 if they had constant mass-tolight ratios. The higher value of H0 = 71 \u00b1 4 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 obtained by Hjorth et al. (2002)\ncan be understood by combining \u00a71.3 and \u00a71.4 with the differences in the models. In particular, Hjorth et al. (2002) truncated the halo of the primary lens near the Einstein radius and\nused a lower mass cluster, both of which lower h\u03bai and raise H0 . The Hjorth et al. (2002)\nmodels also included many more cluster galaxies assuming fixed masses and halo sizes.\nQ0957+561 is a special case because the primary lens galaxy is the brightest cluster\ngalaxy and it lies nearly at the cluster center (Keeton et al. 2000; Chartas et al. 2002). As\na result, the lens modeling problems are particularly severe, and Keeton et al. (2000) found\nthat all previous models (most recently, Barkana et al. 1999; Bernstein & Fischer 1999; and\nChae 1999) were incompatible with the observed geometry of the lensed host galaxy. While\nKeeton et al. (2000) found models consistent with the structure of the lensed host, they covered a range of almost \u00b125% in their estimates of H0 . A satisfactory treatment of this lens\nremains elusive.\nHE1104\u20131805 had its delay measured (Ofek & Maoz 2003) just as we completed this\n16\n\n\fC. S. Kochanek and P. L. Schechter\nreview. Assuming the \u2206t = 161 \u00b1 7 day delay is correct, a standard SIE model of this system\npredicts a very high H0 \u2243 90 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 . The geometry of this system and the fact\nthat the inner image is brighter than the outer image both suggest that HE1104\u20131805 lies in\nan anomalously high tidal shear field, while the standard model includes a prior to keep the\nexternal shear small. A prior is needed because a two-image lens supplies too few constraints\nto determine both the ellipticity of the main lens and the external shear simultaneously. Since\nthe images and the lens in HE1104\u20131805 are nearly colinear, the anomalous H0 estimate for\nthe standard model may be an example of the shear degeneracy we briefly mentioned in\n\u00a71.3. At present the model surveys needed to understand the new delay have not been made.\nObservations of the geometry of the host galaxy Einstein ring will resolve any ambiguities\ndue to the shear in the near future (see \u00a71.7).\nThe lens B1608+656 consists of two interacting galaxies, and, as we discussed in \u00a71.5,\nthis leads to a greatly increased parameter space. Fassnacht et al. (2002) used SIE models\nfor the two galaxies to find H0 = 61 \u2212 65 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 , depending on whether the lens\ngalaxy positions are taken from the H-band or I-band lens HST images (the statistical errors\nare negligible). The position differences are probably created by extinction effects from the\ndust in the lens galaxies. Like isothermal models of the \"simple\" lenses, the H0 estimate\nis below local values, but the disagreement is smaller. These models correctly match the\nobserved time delay ratios.\n\n1.7\n\nSolving the Central Concentration Problem\n\nWe can take four approaches to solving the central concentration problem. First,\nthe density profiles of galaxies are not a complete mystery, and we could apply the constraints derived from observations of other (early-type) galaxies to the time delay systems.\nSecond, we could make new observations of the existing time delay lenses in order to obtain additional data that would constrain the density profiles. Third, we could measure the\ntime delays in the systems where the lens galaxies already have well-constrained densities.\nFourth, we can use the statistical properties of time delay lenses to break the degeneracies\nseen in individual lenses.\nIf we assume that the time delay lenses have the same density structure as other early-type\ngalaxies, then models close to isothermal are favored. For lenses with extended or multicomponent sources, the lens models constrain the density distributions and the best fit models are usually very close to isothermal (e.g., Cohn et al. 2001; Winn, Rusin, & Kochanek\n2003). Stellar dynamical observations of lenses also favor isothermal models (e.g., Treu &\nKoopmans 2002a). Stellar dynamical (e.g., Romanowsky & Kochanek 1999; Gerhard et\nal. 2001) and X-ray (e.g., Loewenstein & Mushotzky 2003) observations of nearby earlytype galaxies generally find flat rotation curves on the relevant scales. Finally, weak lensing\nanalyses require significant dark matter on large scales in early-type galaxies (McKay et\nal. 2002). In general, the data on early-type galaxies seem to prefer isothermal models on\nthe scales relevant to interpreting time delays, while constant M/L models are firmly ruled\nout. If we must ultimately rely on the assumption that the density profiles of time delay\nlenses are similar to those of other early-type galaxies, the additional uncertainty added by\nthis assumption will be small and calculable. Moreover, the assumption is no different from\nthe assumptions of homogeneity used in other studies of the distance scale.\nWe can avoid any such assumptions by determining the density profiles of the time delay\nlenses directly. One approach is to measure the kinematic properties of the lens galaxy. Since\n17\n\n\fC. S. Kochanek and P. L. Schechter\nthe mass inside the Einstein ring is fixed by the image geometry, the velocity dispersion is\ncontrolled by the central concentration of the density. Treu & Koopmans (2002b) apply this\nmethod to PG1115+080 and argue that the observed velocity dispersion requires a mass dis\u22121\ntribution between the isothermal and constant M/L limits with H0 = 59+12\nMpc\u22121 .\n\u22127 km s\nNote, however, that with this velocity dispersion the lens galaxy does not lie on the fundamental plane, which is very peculiar. A second approach is to use deep infrared imaging to determine the structure of the lensed host galaxy of the quasar (Kochanek, Keeton,\n& McLeod 2001). The location and width of the Einstein ring depends on both the radial and angular structure of the potential, although the sensitivity to the radial structure\nof the lens is weak when the annulus bracketing the lensed images is thin (\u2206R/hRi small;\nSaha & Williams 2001). This method will work best for asymmetric two-image lenses\n(\u2206R/hRi \u2248 1). The necessary data can be obtained with HST for most time delay lenses.\nWe can also focus our monitoring campaigns on lenses already known to have wellconstrained density profiles. For the reasons we have already discussed, systems with multicomponent sources, well-studied images of the host galaxy or stellar dynamical measurements will have better constrained density profiles than those without any additional constraints. We can also avoid most of the uncertainties in the density profile by measuring the\ntime delays of very low-redshift lenses. When the lens is very close to the observer, the images lie very close to the center of the lens where the stellar mass dominates. A constant M/L\nmodel then becomes a very good approximation and we need worry little about the amount\nor the distribution of the dark matter. The one such candidate at present, Q2237+0305 at\nzl = 0.04, will have very short delays, but these could be measured by an X-ray monitoring\nprogram using the Chandra observatory.\nFinally, the statistical properties of larger samples of time delay lenses will also help to\nsolve the problem. We already saw in \u00a71.6 that the \"simple\" time delay lenses must have\nvery similar densities, independent of H0 . This already means that the implications for H0\nno longer depend on individual lenses. In some ways the similarity of the densities is not\nan advantage - it is actually easier to determine H0 if the density distributions are inhomogeneous (Kochanek 2003b). On the other hand, there are well-defined approaches to using\nthe statistical properties of lens models to estimate parameters that cannot be determined\nfrom the models of the individual systems (see Kochanek 2001). The statistics of the problematic flux ratios observed in the lenses (see \u00a71.5) may also provide a means of estimating\nh\u03bai. Schechter & Wambsganss (2002) point out that in four-image quasar lenses there is\na tendency for the brightest saddle point image to be demagnified compared to reasonable\nlens models. Microlensing by the stars can naturally explain the observations if the surface\ndensity of stars is a small fraction of the total surface density near the images (\u03ba\u2217 \u226a h\u03bai),\nwhich would rule out constant M/L models where \u03ba\u2217 \u2243 h\u03bai.\n\n1.8\n\nConclusions\n\nThe determination of H0 using gravitational lens time delays has come of age. The\nlast few years have seen a dramatic increase in the number of delay measurements, and\nthere is no barrier other than sociology to rapidly increasing the sample. The interpretation\nof time delays requires a model for the gravitational potential of the lens. Fortunately, the\nphysics determining time delays is well understood, and the only important variable is the\naverage surface density h\u03bai of the lens near the images for which the delay is measured.\nUnfortunately, there is a tendency in the literature to conceal rather than to illuminate this\n18\n\n\fC. S. Kochanek and P. L. Schechter\nunderstanding. Provided a lens does not lie in a cluster where the cluster potential cannot\nbe described by a simple expansion, any lens model that includes the parameters needed to\nvary the average surface density of the lens near the images and to change the ratio between\nthe quadrupole moment of the lens and the environment includes all the parameters needed\nto model time delays, to estimate the Hubble constant, and to understand the systematic\nuncertainties in the results. All differences between estimates of the Hubble constant for the\nsimple time delay lenses can be understood on this basis.\nModels for the four time delay lenses that can be modeled using a single lens galaxy\npredict that H0 = 48 \u00b1 3 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 if the lens galaxies have isothermal density profiles\nwith flat rotation curves, and H0 = 71 \u00b1 3 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 if they have constant mass-to-light\nratios. The Key Project estimate of H0 = 72 \u00b1 8 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 agrees with the lensing results\nonly if the lenses have little dark matter. We have strong theoretical prejudices and estimates\nfrom other observations of early-type galaxies that we should favor the isothermal models\nover the constant M/L models. We feel that we have reached the point where the results\nfrom gravitational lens time delays deserve serious attention and that there is a reasonable\nlikelihood that the local estimates of H0 are too high. A modest investment of telescope time\nwould allow the measurement of roughly 5\u201310 time delays per year, and these new delays\nwould rapidly test the current results. Other observations of time delay lenses to measure\nthe velocity dispersions of the lens galaxies or to determine the geometry of the lensed\nimages of the quasar host galaxy can be used to constrain the mass distributions directly.\nThe systematic problems associated with the density profile are soluble not only in theory\nbut also in practice, and the investment of the community's resources would be significantly\nless that than already invested in the distance scale.\nThe time delay measurements also provide a new probe of the density structure of galaxies\nat the boundary between the baryonic and dark matter dominated parts of galaxies (projected\ndistances of 1\u20132 effective radii). Even if we ignore the actual value of H0 , we can still study\nthe differences in the surface densities. For example, we can show that the present sample of\nsimple lenses must have very similar surface densities. This region is very difficult to study\nwith other probes.\nFinally, the time delay measurements can be used to determine cosmological parameters.\nTime delays basically measure the distance to the lens galaxy, so we can make the same\nsorts of cosmological measurements as Type Ia supernovae. If the variations in h\u03bai between\nlens galaxies are small, as seem to be indicated by the present data, then the accuracy of\nthe differential measurements will be very good. The present sample has little sensitivity\nto the cosmological model even with the mass distribution fixed because the time delay\nuncertainties are still too large and the redshift range is too restricted (zl = 0.31 to 0.72).\nIf we assume that other methods will determine the distance factors more accurately and\nrapidly, then we can use the time delays to study the evolution of galaxy mass distributions\nwith redshift.\nAcknowledgements.
