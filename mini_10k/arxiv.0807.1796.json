Introduction\nWavelet methods have been used for the past 10 years to study\nthe variability timescales in different types of astronomical objects (e.g. Foster 1996; Priestley 1997; Scargle 1997). Wavelets\nhave properties superior to Fourier based methods, the most useful being the locality of the timescale. In Fourier based methods a single sinusoid is fitted to the whole light curve, whereas\nwavelets enable us to study temporally local timescales or periods that are present in the light curves. This is a very good\nproperty when studying flux curves of AGNs, which are almost\nnever strictly periodic over long times.\nWavelets were used to study variability timescales of a\nlarger sample of AGNs by Kelly et al. (2003). They used the\ncross-wavelet transform to study quasi-periodic variations in the\nPearson-Readhead VLBI sample, monitored by the University of\nMichigan Radio Observatory (UMRAO). A quasi-periodic behaviour was found in a little over half of the 30 sources they\nstudied. Individual sources have also been studied for quasiperiodicity and periodicity using wavelets (e.g. Hughes et al.\n1998; Lehto 1999; Kadler et al. 2006; Ciprini et al. 2007).\nIn Hovatta et al. (2007), hereafter Paper I, we studied the\nvariability timescales of a large sample of AGNs using the structure function (SF), the discrete autocorrelation function (DCF)\nand the Lomb-Scargle periodogram. We found that larger flares\nin these sources happen quite rarely, only once in 4\u20136 years\nwhile short-term variations are continuously present in the flux\ncurves. Also, many of the sources had changed their behaviour\nduring the 25 years of monitoring which is one reason why we\nwanted to study the sample again using wavelets. In Paper I we\nalso studied the properties of the methods and their differences\nby searching for the characteristic timescales. We noticed that\nthere are several problems when using periodograms to study\nthe timescales because none of the sources in our sample showed\n\nstrict periodicities in their flux curves or were well characterised\nby sinusoids.\nIn this paper we will compare the results from this wavelet\nanalysis to Paper I. This paper is organised as follows: In Sect. 2\nwe describe the source sample and data used. Section 3 includes\nthe description of the method and in Sect. 4 we present the results. The discussion is in Sect. 5 and the conclusions are drawn\nin Sect. 6.\n\n2. The sample and observations\nWe used the same sample of 80 AGNs selected from the\nMets\u00e4hovi monitoring list that was used in Paper I. The sample\nconsists of 24 BL Lacertae Objects (BLOs), 23 Highly Polarised\nQuasars (HPQs), 28 Low Polarisation Quasars (LPQs) and 5\nRadio Galaxies (GALs). The five sources with no information\nabout their optical polarisation are considered to be LPQs in this\nstudy and are included in the numbers above.\nAll sources have been monitored for at least 10 years at 22\nor 37 GHz. These are all bright sources with a flux density of\nat least 1 Jy in the active state in at least one of the two frequencies. We used the 22, 37 and 87 GHz data obtained with\nthe Mets\u00e4hovi 14-metre radio telescope over 25 years of monitoring (Salonen et al. 1987; Ter\u00e4sranta et al. 1992, 1998, 2004,\n2005; Nieppola et al. 2007). The 37 GHz data of HPQs, LPQs\nand GALs from December 2001 until March 2005 are partially\nunpublished. The details of the observation method and data reduction processes are given in Ter\u00e4sranta et al. (1998). In addition we used 90 GHz data obtained with the Swedish-ESO\nSubmillimetre Telescope (SEST) at La Silla, Chile, which was\nused in our monitoring campaign to sample the high frequency,\n90 and 230 GHz variability of southern and equatorial sources\n(Tornikoski et al. 1996). The monitoring campaign at SEST\nlasted from 1987 to 2003 from which the data from 1994.5-2003\n\n\f2\n\nT. Hovatta et al.: Wavelet analysis of a large sample of AGN at high radio frequencies\n\nare unpublished. Complementary high frequency data at 90 GHz\nwere also collected from the literature (Steppe et al. 1988, 1992,\n1993; Reuter et al. 1997). The median intervals between the observations at 22, 37 and 90 GHz are 31, 41 and 47 days, respectively. The values depend on the source and at 37 GHz the minimum average sampling rate was 6.8 days for the source 3C 84\nwhich is used as a secondary calibrator in the Mets\u00e4hovi observations. The maximum average value at 37 GHz was 186.4 days\nfor the source 2234+282.\n\n3. The wavelet method\nWe have analysed the light curves using Morlet wavelets. They\ncan be understood as local wave packets. The method is closely\nrelated to chirp analysis methods, Short Time Fourier Transform\nmethods, Gabor transforms and also to the sonogram or spectrogram analysis used widely in audio signal processing. In wavelet\nanalysis the length of the analysis \"package\", the kernel, is proportional to the timescale of interest, or in terms of frequency,\nproportional to the inverse of the frequency. We have used a\nMorlet wavelet, which can be understood mathematically as a\nlocalised plane wave tapered by a Gaussian function. For longer\ntimescales of interest we thus use lower frequency sinusoids\nthan for higher frequencies according to the following equations.\nWavelet transforms are functions of both frequency, f , (or the respective timescale) and the local time, \u03c4.\n!\n1\n2\ng ( f, \u03c4) = exp \u2212ic f (t \u2212 \u03c4) \u2212 ( f (t \u2212 \u03c4)) ,\n2\n\u2217\n\n(1)\n\nwhere we adopt c = 2\u03c0, which characterises the amount of tapering. The power of the wavelet transform, known as the scalogram, is defined for evenly spaced data as\n\u0010\n\u0011\nW( f, \u03c4) = f * S 2 ( f, \u03c4) + C 2 ( f, \u03c4) ,\n(2)\nwhere\nS ( f, \u03c4) =\n\nN\nX\n\n!\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u22121\n( f (t j \u2212 \u03c4))2 ,\nm j sin 2\u03c0 f (t j \u2212 \u03c4) exp\n2\nj=1\n\n(3)\n\nN\nX\n\n(4)\n\n!\n\u22121\n2\n( f (t j \u2212 \u03c4)) ,\nC( f, \u03c4) =\nm j cos 2\u03c0 f (t j \u2212 \u03c4) exp\n2\nj=1\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nwhere m j and t j are respectively the flux density and the time of\nthe observation j.\nFor unevenly spaced data we have to weight each point with\nthe inverse of the local density of points. The locality, a property\nof wavelets and other similar methods mentioned above, is in\nstrong contrast to global methods such as Fourier transforms or\nstructure functions, which treat the whole light curve as one entity. A change in a few critical points can change the final result\nin global methods rather significantly, whereas in wavelet analysis and other local methods a chance point in the data will only\naffect the analysis locally. As we gain information about the local nature of the signal we lose in the resolution with which we\ncan determine the timescale (or frequency) of the signal. The\nlength of the kernel used limits our resolution to about 0.07 in\nlog space, which is significantly worse than what would be obtained e.g. from the Fourier analysis of a long lasting sinusoid\nwith a constant period. Wavelet transforms with longer kernels\n\ncould also be applied to the data as intermediate forms approaching Fourier transforms in accuracy, but in doing so one loses the\nlocality information according to\n\u2206t\u2206\u03bd > \u03b4,\n\n(5)\n\nwhich is analogous to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Here\n\u03b4 can be considered as unity if we are interested in separating\ntwo nearby peaks. If we rather wish to measure the location of\na\u221a single signal in weakly noisy data then \u03b4 is of the order of\n(1/N), where N is the local number of points.\nFirst we calculate the scalogram for our unevenly spaced\ndata. We then calculate a scalogram of normally distributed\nGaussian white noise with a variance of unity sampled as was the\noriginal data. By repeating this 20 times we get a good estimate\nof the scalogram of this white noise. We then normalise our original scalogram by the white noise scalogram. If our data were\npure noise, this noise-normalised scalogram would have everywhere an expected value equal to the variance of our measurements. Alternatively, we argue that by taking the square root of\nthe noise-normalised scalogram and dividing it by the (known)\nmeasurement errors we get an estimate of the significance of the\nvariations detected. If a variability timescale has a variance of\n> 9 as expected from measurement errors, we consider that a\nsignificant detection and if the variance is between 4 and 9 times\nthe variance of measurements, we consider that a marginal case\n(marked as a weak timescale in Table 1). These numbers were\nselected to represent \"2 and 3 sigma\" levels, but we caution that\nthese should be considered indicative only, as we have not yet\ncarried out full simulations of the probability density distributions of the noise properties in noise-normalised scalograms.\n\n4. Wavelet timescales\n4.1. Interpretation\n\nThe advantage of wavelets is that in addition to finding the variability timescale in the frequency domain, we can see at what\nmoments it has been present. This enables us to see whether the\ntimescale is present during the whole observed time or is transient. In addition we can identify typical flare timescales i.e. flare\nduration or rise and decay times and notice whether one large\noutburst dominates the timescale obtained. Also short-term variability is easily detected.\nWe searched for both long-term variability, which is present\nmost of the time in the flux curves, and typical timescales in\nwhich the flares occur. For the long-term timescales we first\nidentified the timescale from the frequency axis and then determined how long it has been present on the time axis. This way\nwe can study how many times the timescale has repeated during\nthe time it has been present and also how long time it has been\npresent compared to the total observing period. Figure 1 shows\nthe wavelet transform for the source 1156+295 (4C 29.45). We\nfind a timescale of 3.4 years (100.53 years) which is present in\nthe latter half of the flux curve, starting at 1995. The timescale\nis marked with a circle in the plot. Furthermore we identified\ntypical flare timescales in the cases where more than one flare\noccurs on approximately the same timescale. For 1156+295 it is\nseen at 1.7 years (100.23 years). This timescale is also shown in\nthe plot as circles at the beginning of the time series at the time\nof the first two flares and later simultaneously with the long-term\ntrend. The timescale can be identified with the durations of these\nflares which are of about 1\u20132 years.\nOften the long-term timescales are either slowly shortening\nor increasing in time which is seen as rising or declining trends in\n\n\fT. Hovatta et al.: Wavelet analysis of a large sample of AGN at high radio frequencies\n\n3\n\nBLOs differ. Similar results were obtained in Paper I, when periodogram timescales were studied.\nWe were also interested in sources in which the timescale is\npresent during most of the flux curve. By visually extracting the\nduration of the timescale from the wavelet plot, we calculated\nhow much of the total monitoring time it has been present. In\n27 cases the timescale was present at least 90% of the total observing time. Seven of these, however, were cases in which the\ntimescale had not repeated twice during the period it was visible.\n4.3. Flare timescales\n\nFig. 1. Wavelet transform of the source 1156+295 at 22 GHz.\nThe y-axis is frequency 1/year so that a timescale of 1 year\ncorresponds to frequency 0 and a timescale of 10 years corresponds to frequency \u22121 in the log-axis. A long-term variability\ntimescale of 3.4 years (100.53 years) is visible in the latter half\nof the flux curve starting at 1995. A flare timescale of 1.7 years\n(100.23 years) is also seen.\n\nthe wavelet plot. These are often connected to flares and usually\nthe timescales shorten towards the peak of a large flare.\n4.2. Long-term trends\n\nWe were able to determine a long-term timescale for 122 cases\nout of the total 192 cases for which we calculated the wavelet\ntransform. In addition to the timescale, we determined how long\nit is present in the flux curve. This way we were able to calculate\nhow many times the cycle has repeated itself. The timescales\nare listed in Table 1, where the B1950-name, a well-known\nalias (when applicable), classification, total monitoring time,\ntimescale and number of cycles and timescale of flares are tabulated for each frequency band. If there is more than one timescale\npresent the most significant one is given first. In 18 sources (\u223c1/4\nof the sample) we found long-lasting cycles, continuing for at\nleast four cycles. Five of these sources showed cycles at two\nseparate frequencies and three sources at all the three frequency\nbands. There were 31 cases where the variability timescale did\nnot last for two cycles. In Table 2 we have calculated averages\nand medians for the timescales continuing for at least two cycles.\nThey are given for each frequency and source class separately.\nIn addition we corrected the timescales for redshift and these\naverages are also shown in Table 2.\nWe ran a Kruskal-Wallis analysis to study whether the\ntimescales at different frequencies and source classes differ from\neach other. The timescales at 90 GHz differ from lower frequencies with a 95% confidence limit with the timescales being shorter. The result can be affected by the smaller number\nof sources at 90 GHz and shorter monitoring period which also\nshortens the timescales obtained at 90 GHz. We studied the differences between the source classes at 22 and 37 GHz and at\nboth frequencies the classes do not differ significantly from each\nother if the observational uncorrected timescales are considered.\nWhen we study the redshift corrected timescales we see significant differences between the BLOs and LPQs at 37 GHz and\nin addition there is strong indication that also the HPQs and\n\nIn addition to long-term trends we determined a flare timescale\nwhich describes the duration or rise and decay times of flares.\nThese timescales are seen in the wavelet transform at the times of\nthe outbursts. We determined such a timescale in 53 cases. They\nare also tabulated in Table 1. We have taken into account cases\nfor which a similar timescale seems to be present during more\nthan one flare and therefore represented a typical flare timescale\nfor the source. The values we obtained vary between 0.34\u20132.17\nyears at 22 and 37 GHz. The average value at 22 GHz is 1.16\nyears and at 37 GHz it is 1.03 years. At 90 GHz, there were only\n6 sources which showed repeating flares and the timescales were\nshorter, varying between 0.34 and 0.87 years, with an average of\n0.69 years.\n4.4. Individual sources\n\nEven though none of the sources studied here seems to show a\nstrict periodicity in radio frequencies, many of them show quasiperiodic behaviour. We are interested in sources that have a variability timescale lasting four cycles in at least two of the frequency bands. There are eight such sources and their properties\nare discussed in more detail below. The wavelet plots for these\nsources at 37 GHz are shown in Figs. 2\u20139 (only available in electronic form via http://www.aanda.org).\nDA 55 (0133+476): This HPQ source has been monitored in\nMets\u00e4hovi for over 20 years at 22 and 37 GHz and for almost\n15 years at 90 GHz. It has shown high apparent pattern velocity\nof 18c in the jet (Piner et al. 2007) and has been also a target\nof many other studies using Very Long Baseline Interferometry\n(VLBI) observations (e.g. Lister 2001; Kellermann et al. 2004;\nLister & Homan 2005). It is also included in the wavelet study\nof Kelly et al. (2003) which uses the UMRAO 4.8, 8, 14.5 GHz\nmonitoring data. They found a timescale of 2.3 years for the\nsource at 14.5 GHz. This is very close to the timescale of 2.2\nyears which we obtained for the source at both 22 and 37 GHz.\nAt 90 GHz we only found a flare timescale of 0.7 years for\nthe source. The long-term timescale in our analysis has a rising trend so that it is shortening towards a peak of a large flare.\nThe timescale is present only for about 40% of the flux curve\nat both 22 and 37 GHz but still has repeated 4.4 times at both\nof the frequency bands. In Paper I we could not find any DCF\nor periodogram timescale for the source. When the flux curve is\nexamined we can clearly see that the timescale obtained here is\nrelated to a period when the source had many similar flares and\nthe total flux level rises. This also explains the rising trend in the\nwavelet plot which is caused by more frequent individual flares\ntowards the peak of the larger event.\n3C 120 (0430+052): This radio galaxy has been monitored\nin Mets\u00e4hovi for over 20 years at 22 and 37 GHz and for 15\nyears at 90 GHz.

Our wavelet analyses reveal a timescale of\n4.3 years at both 22 and 37 GHz. At 22 GHz the timescale has\nbeen present for 85% of the total observing period lasting for\n4.4 cycles. At 37 GHz it has been present for 84% of the time\nand persisted for 4.6 cycles. In Paper I the DCF analyses showed\na timescale of 4.2 years at 22 GHz which is very close to what\nwe obtained here. Both frequencies also show flare timescales\nof 1.4 years and in addition 0.5 years at 22 GHz and 0.3 years at\n37 GHz. These timescales are also seen in the DCF and SF analyses of Paper I. At 90 GHz the timescale obtained is 2.7 years\nand it has been present for 73% of the time and continued for 4\ncycles. This timescale is also very close to the DCF timescale of\n2.9 years.\nVisual inspection of the flux curve at 37 GHz shows that indeed many of the larger flares have approximately 4.5 to 5 years\nbetween them but there are also additional flares in between. The\nlast big flare included in our analysis at 37 GHz peaked in the autumn of 2003. The next big flare was observed at the end of 2006\nwith an interval of 3 years between the flares. This indicates that\nthe source is not strictly periodic but has shown a characteristic\ntimescale of 4.3 years.\n0736+017: This HPQ source was not detected by EGRET\nbut has been listed as a possible \u03b3\u2212ray source to be detected\nwith the new satellite missions AGILE and GLAST (Bach et al.\n2007). In Mets\u00e4hovi it has been monitored for over 20 years\nat 22 and 37 GHz and for 11 years at 90 GHz. It exhibits rapid\nvariability and in the optical domain it has been studied by several authors (e.g. Clements et al. 2003; Ram\u0131\u0301rez et al. 2004). The\nwavelet plot has a complex structure at all the frequency bands\nand we found multiple timescales for the source. The most significant and long-lasting ones are 2.7, 3.4 and 1.7 years at 22, 37\nand 90 GHz, respectively. The timescales have repeated themselves 4 times at all the frequency bands and are also present for\nabout half of the flux curve. The DCF analysis of Paper I shows\nvery similar timescales of 2.8 years at 22 and 37 GHz and 1.2\nyears at 90 GHz. At 22 and 37 GHz there are multiple timescales\npresent also in the DCF which confirms the complex variability\nof this source. Therefore it is also difficult to predict when the\nnext flares could be expected.\nOJ 248 (0827+243): This radio quasar was found by\nEGRET to be a bright \u03b3\u2212ray source. It has been monitored at\nMets\u00e4hovi for about 11 years both at 22 and 37 GHz. It has\nalso been a target of multiwavelength campaigns (e.g. Bach et al.\n2007) and has shown extremely fast apparent pattern velocity\nexceeding 25c in the jet (Piner et al. 2006). The kiloparsec-scale\njet is studied in more detail in Jorstad & Marscher (2004). We\n\nfound a timescale of 1.4 years at both frequency bands but it appears quite weak in strength and is classified as a weak timescale\nat 22 GHz. At 22 GHz it has been present for 54% of the time\nand is discontinuous. It repeated 4.2 times during the time it has\nbeen present. At 37 GHz the timescale has been present for 77%\nof the time and has a shortening trend changing the timescale\nfrom 1.4 to 1.1 years. The timescale repeated 6.3 times. In Paper\nI we measured timescales of 1.7 and 1.4 years at 22 and 37 GHz\nrespectively from the DCF analyses.\nOJ 287 (0851+202): This BLO type object is one of the\nmost studied AGNs. In Mets\u00e4hovi it has been monitored for over\n25 years at 22 and 37 GHz and at 90 GHz for 15 years. In the\noptical there is strong evidence of a period of about 12 years\nwhich is explained by several binary black hole models (e.g.\nSillanp\u00e4\u00e4 et al. 1988; Lehto & Valtonen 1996; Valtaoja et al.\n2000; Valtonen et al. 2008). We can neither confirm nor disprove the existence of the same period at our frequency bands\nbecause the monitoring time is too short compared to the optical\nhistorical light curve which is over 100 years long. The source\nhas also been studied with wavelets by Hughes et al. (1998).\nThey used the continuous wavelet transform to study more than\n20 years of data obtained in the University of Michigan Radio\nObservatory (UMRAO) at 4.8, 8 and 14.5 GHz. They found a\npersistent timescale of 1.66 years in the total flux and polarisation and another timescale of 1.12 years dominating the activity\nin the 1980s. They explained the modulations with a shock-in-jet\nmodel in which the permanent timescale is associated with the\nquiescent jet and the shorter timescale is due to the passage of a\nshock.\nWe found a timescale of 1.4 years at 22 and 90 GHz and 1.7\nyears at 37 GHz. Both of these can be considered to be very similar to the ones obtained by Hughes et al. (1998), given the ambiguity in determining the exact time scale in our analysis. A very\ninteresting phenomenon seen in the wavelet transform is that the\ntimescale either weakened or totally disappeared between 1993\nand 2000. Due to this the timescale is present only for 2/3 of\nthe time in all the frequency bands. It can be clearly seen in the\nflux density curve in Fig. 6 that the flux density level is generally\nlower during that time, even though smaller flares occur continuosly. It is also possible to see in the wavelet plot that the number of rapid flares is lower during that period than in the more\nactive states. Nevertheless the timescale repeated 10.2 times at\n22 GHz, 9.6 times at 37 GHz and 7.2 times at 90 GHz. All the\ntimescales have a corresponding one in the DCF analysis of\nPaper I within 6 months of the one obtained from wavelet analysis. When studying the flare timescales we noticed timescales\nof 0.4 and 0.3 years at 22 and 37 GHz, respectively. These agree\nwith timescales from the SF analysis in Paper I. It is difficult to\n\n\fT. Hovatta et al.: Wavelet analysis of a large sample of AGN at high radio frequencies\n\nassociate the timescales with individual flares because the source\nexhibits continuous variability and is almost never in a quiescent\nstate.\nOL 093 (1055+018): This HPQ source has been observed in\nMets\u00e4hovi for over 20 years at 22 and 37 GHz and for almost\n13 years at 90 GHz. The jet of this source is suggested to have\na spine-sheath structure (Attridge et al. 1999; Pushkarev et al.\n2005). We obtained a timescale of 4.3 years for the source at\nboth of the 22 and 37 GHz frequencies. The timescale repeated\n4.4 times and is present for 85 and 80% of the flux curve at 22\nand 37 GHz, respectively. Very similar timescales are measured\nin Paper I, where a DCF timescale of 4.7 and 4.4 years are obtained at 22 and 37 GHz, respectively. At 90 GHz we obtain a\ntimescale of 2.7 years but it repeated only 2.6 times. When examining the flux curve at 37 GHz we see that indeed there are\nmany flares with approximately 4\u20135 years between them. The\nlast flare included in the wavelet analysis peaked in 2002 and another large flare was observed in 2007, producing a time interval\nof 5 years between the flares. In addition there was a smaller flare\npeaking in 2004 which shows that even though the timescale of\n4.3 years describes the larger events quite well, there is still more\ncomplex variability present in this source.\n4C 38.41 (1633+382): This is another EGRET-detected\n\u03b3\u2212ray bright quasar which has been a target of many different\nobserving programs (e.g. Katajainen et al. 2000; Jorstad et al.\n2001; Lister & Homan 2005; Bach et al. 2007). In Mets\u00e4hovi it\nhas been monitored for over 20 years at 22 and 37 GHz. It is also\nincluded in the wavelet study of Kelly et al. (2003) which used\nthe UMRAO data at 4.8, 8 and 14.5 GHz. In their analysis no\ntimescale was found for the source. We found a timescale of 3.4\nyears in both frequency bands but the wavelet plot has a complex\nstructure and the variability timescale is weaker in the late 1980s\nand early 1990s. The timescale has been present for almost 3/4\nof the flux curve in both frequency bands and repeated 4.8 and\n5.1 times at the 22 and 37 GHz frequencies, respectively. The\ntimescale is not seen in DCF analysis of Paper I, probably because even though there are some flares with 3.5 years between\nthem, it is not a timescale clearly seen to repeat in the flux curve.\nPKS 1749+096: This BLO type object has been monitored\nin Mets\u00e4hovi for 20 years at 22 GHz and 25 years at 37 GHz. At\n90 GHz the data sets are 14 years long. The source has been a target of many Very Long Baseline observations (e.g. Homan et al.\n2001; Wiik et al. 2001; Lister & Homan 2005; Piner et al. 2007).\nWe found a timescale of 2.7 years in all the frequency bands\nbut the structure of the wavelet plot is very complex and the\ntimescale is increasing in time from 1.7 to 2.7 years. At 90 GHz\nit also repeated only 3.4 times while at 22 GHz 4.4 and at 37 GHz\n5 times. At all frequency bands the timescale has also been\npresent for less than 70% of the time. Nevertheless timescales\nof 2.8 years at 22 and 37 GHz and 2.3 years at 90 GHz are also\nseen in the DCF analysis of Paper I. In addition we found flare\ntimescales of 0.4 and 0.5 years at 22 and 37 GHz, respectively.\nBoth are also seen within 0.2 years in the SF analysis of Paper I.\nThe source exhibits rapid variability and has many large flares in\nthe flux curve. Indeed many of the flares seem to be within 2.7\nyears of each other but there is also other activity present making\nthe analysis complex.\n\n5. Discussion\nOur interest in using wavelets to study the timescales arose from\nthe results of Paper I, which showed that many of the sources\nhave changed their behaviour during the monitoring time and\nthe timescales have changed over the years. A useful property\n\n5\n\nof wavelets is that they show also when the timescale has been\npresent and how it has changed. Many studies on individual\nsources have claimed the sources to be periodic or quasi-periodic\nbased on results from Fourier-based methods. Our results show\nthat only a very small number of sources actually show persistent timescales lasting over the total monitoring time (18 sources\nin which the timescale had lasted for over 90% of the total monitoring time). A good example is the source 1156+295 shown in\nFig. 1. The wavelet timescale of 3.4 years is seen to be present\nonly in the latter half of the flux curve. In Fig. 11 of Paper I\nthe DCF and Lomb-Scargle periodogram analyses are shown for\nthe same source. The DCF gives a timescale of 3.5 years and\nthe Lomb-Scargle periodogram a timescale of 3.3 years which\nare very close to the timescale obtained with wavelets. With\nthese methods, however, it was impossible to see that the source\nhad changed its behaviour in the mid 1990s and the timescale\nwas only present for the latter half of the monitoring period.\nIn eight cases the timescale either disappeared or weakened at\nsome point during the monitoring period and re-appeared later\non. These changes cannot be detected by Fourier-based methods. Therefore we feel that wavelets should be used more when\ncharacteristic timescales and quasi-periodicities are studied.\nIn many cases the timescale also changed slowly over time.\nIn 17 cases we saw a rising trend in the wavelet plot, which\nmeans a shortening timescale. These were often connected to\nlong-lasting flares which showed shorter timescales towards the\npeak of the flare. This could indicate that there are more disturbances in the jet when a flare is growing and more shocks are\ndeveloping in the jet, making the timescale shorter. Also, in six\ncases we detected a declining trend in the wavelet plot, indicating an increasing timescale. In these cases the activity is becoming less frequent and flares do not occur as often as earlier.\nIn Paper I we also found that the traditional Fourier-based\nmethods have many problems when non-sinusoid flux curves are\nstudied. In our sample this is the case for all sources. Especially\nwith Lomb-Scargle periodogram, we obtain spurious timescales\nand other methods are needed to confirm the timescales. The\nDCF seemed slightly more reliable but it also has no means of\nshowing if the timescale is discontinuous or changes in time. We\ncompared our results from the wavelet analysis with those obtained in Paper I. The wavelet timescales are plotted against the\nDCF and periodogram timescales in Fig. 10. We can see a very\ngood correspondence between the different timescales. We also\ncalculated the Spearman rank correlation and between wavelet\nand DCF timescales we obtain a correlation of r = 0.58 (p <\n0.0001). Similarly between wavelet and periodogram timescales\nwe obtain r = 0.55 (p < 0.0001). The correlation between the\nwavelet and periodogram timescales is affected by sources that\nhave longer periodogram timescales of over 7 years but shorter\nwavelet timescales of 2 to 5 years. In almost all cases the periodogram analysis also revealed another timescale, similar to the\nwavelet timescale, but in our study we only used the most significant timescale from the periodogram analysis. Only for one\nsource (0736+017) did the periodogram analysis give only long\ntimescales of over 8 years whereas the wavelet analysis gave\nshort 2.7 and 3.4 years timescales. This source, however, has a\ncomplex structure in the wavelet plot (as seen in Fig. 4) and multiple timescales are seen.\nThe average timescales of wavelet and DCF analyses are\nalso very similar with the difference being less than 6 months\nat all frequency bands. The averages of the periodogram analyses are slightly higher. The results show that both wavelet and\nDCF analyses give similar results and can be used to determine\ncharacteristic timescales. The advantage of wavelets is that we\n\n\f6\n\nT. Hovatta et al.: Wavelet analysis of a large sample of AGN at high radio frequencies\n\nsoon. In particular, we were interested to see if we can predict\nwhich sources would be likely to flare during the early operation\nof the upcoming gamma-ray satellite GLAST. Our earlier work\n(e.g. Tornikoski et al. 2002; L\u00e4hteenm\u00e4ki & Valtaoja 2003) has\nshown that strong gamma-ray activity usually corresponds to a\ngrowing flare in the radio regime. Therefore sources that are active in the radio domain are potential sources to be detected by\nGLAST.\nThus, we wanted to see which sources in our sample would\nbe good candidates for strong flaring within the timeframe 2008\u2013\n2009, excluding a set of sources that have almost continuous\nand complex variability at 37 GHz, such as OJ 287 and BL\nLac. From the wavelet timescales at 37 GHz, combined with the\ntimescale analysis from Paper I and with visual examination of\nlight curves until the end of 2007, we came up with a list of six\nsources that according to the wavelet analysis and at least one\nother method used in Paper I show semi-periodicity with such\ntimescales that a strong radio flare could be anticipated to occur within 2008\u20132009. The sources include one GAL type object (0007+106), two HPQs (0234+285, 1156+295), two LPQs\n(0333+321, 2145+067) and one BLO (1749+096).\n\n6. Conclusions\n\nFig. 10. Upper panel: Long-term wavelet timescale against the\nDCF timescale from Paper I. Lower panel: The same wavelet\ntimescale against the Lomb-Scargle periodogram timescale from\nPaper I.\ncan also take into account how long a certain timescale has been\npresent in the flux curve.\nIn our sample we had nine sources for which Kelly et al.\n(2003) found variability timescales at some of the UMRAO frequencies. For one of those (1823+568) we were not able to find\nany variability timescale in our analyses. In almost all cases we\nwere able to find a similar timescale within 0.5 years of the\ntimescale reported at one of the low frequencies. Only in one\ncase was the timescale totally different (1641+399) and in one\ncase (0212+735 at 37 GHz) there was a difference of 0.7 years\nbetween the timescales. In three cases it was the timescale we\nrefer to as the flare timescale that was similar to the lower frequency timescale. The similarity between the results from the\ntwo analyses supports use of the method.\nEven though we found no strict periodicities in the radio behaviour of any of our sources, either in Paper I or in this paper, we wanted to investigate the possibility of \"predicting\" upcoming active states in these sources. Many of these sources\nhave changed their behaviour during the 20 years of observations\n(for example 1156+295 in Fig. 1), thus such predictions would\nbe based purely on their statistical behaviour. This attempt was\npartly motivated by the multifrequency support observations we\nparticipate in: it would be immensely useful to be able to prioritise those sources that are likely to enter an active state fairly\n\nWe studied a sample of 80 sources with the continuous wavelet\ntransform using data at 22, 37 and 90 GHz. Our aim was to study\nthe variability behaviour of the sources and also to better understand the method and to compare it with Fourier-based methods.\nWe found no clear periodicities in the sources. Instead in most of\nthe sources the timescales appeared only for a short time in the\ntotal monitoring period or changed over the years. These kind\nof properties are not revealed with Fourier-based methods and\ntherefore wavelets should be used more when quasi-periodicities\nare studied. In our sample only 1/4 had a timescale that had\nbeen present for at least 4 cycles. In eight of these sources the\ntimescale was present in more than one frequency band. This\nshows that the sources are never strictly periodic and conclusions\nabout periodicities in the radio frequencies should be drawn with\ncaution.\nThe average timescale from the wavelet analysis is 4.5 years\nwhich is the same as was obtained in the DCF analysis of Paper\nI. This timescale should not be affected by the length of the\nmonitoring period because we used all the sources in which the\ntimescale had repeated at least twice in the analysis and therefore longer timescales also are included in the calculations. The\nweakness of wavelets is that we cannot detect the timescale with\nthe same accuracy as with DCF or periodograms and therefore\nboth type of methods should be used when periodicities or quasiperiodicities are searched for. The wavelets should be used to\nverify whether the timescale is persistent or short-lived. If a persistent timescale is found, the Fourier methods can be used to\naccurately determine the timescale. In our analysis where the\ncharacteristic timescales are studied, the accuracy of wavelets is\nenough to determine the approximate timescale.\nAcknowledgements.
