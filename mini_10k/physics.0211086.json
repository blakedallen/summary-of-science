By injecting 10% dextrose solution at a vena femoralis\none makes the intravascular BongHan duct thicker and stronger to be easily detectable after incision\nof vessels. The duct is semi-transparent, soft and elastic, and composed of smaller tubules whose\ndiameters are of 10\u03bcm order, which is in agreement with BongHan theory.\n\nI.\n\nNTRODUCTION\n\nRecently observation of hidden anatomical structures\nof threadlike ducts inside blood vessels was reported.[1]\nThese threads of tubular bundles are intravascular BongHan ducts.\nAccording to the BongHan theory [2, 3] there is a circulatory system that is completely different from blood\nsystems, lymphatic systems, and nervous systems. The\nsystem is composed of BongHan ducts of which acupuncture meridian system of Traditional Korean Medicine is\na subsystem. In addition to the meridians there is a host\nof network of BongHan ducts in which BongHan liquid\nflows, and the liquid is quite distinct from blood, or other\nknown fluids inside animals or humans.\nThe BongHan theory claimed that some parts of BongHan ducts run inside arteries and veins as threadlike bundles of tubules floating in the flow of blood. However,\nno one has confirmed it despite intensive search for it in\n1960s, and thus the theory itself has been disregarded for\nalmost forty years. The main reason for not reproducing BongHan's results is that the staining material and\nmethod, the key technique in BongHan theory, were not\ndisclosed.\nIn this paper we present a completely new method\nwhich is distinctively different from BongHan's staining\napproach. Our method is a relatively simple procedure to\ndisclose intra blood vessel ducts (IBVD) which form part\n\n\u2217 A permanent address: Dept. of Veterinary, College of Agriculture,\nYanbian University, Jilin, China\n\u2020 Correspondence:\nKwang-Sup Soh;\nElectronic address:\nkssoh@kmc.snu.ac.kr; URL: http://kmc.snu.ac.kr/~kssoh\n\nof the net of BongHan ducts. We have not yet developed\nto search other ducts such as inside lymph vessels and\nnerves, and under the skin. Nevertheless our new finding\nis easily reproducible by others, and will usher to further\nstudies of the BongHan duct system such as histological,\nchemical, and physiological analysis.\n\nII.\n\nMETHODS\n\nOur principal contribution is the discovery of the new\nmethod to reveal and take samples of BongHan ducts\ninside arteries and veins. These IBVDs were found in\nvarious large blood vessels of rats and rabbits. We examined successfully ten rats (Sprague Dawley, 900g) and\nfour rabbits (New Zealand White, 2000g) which were\nobtained from the Laboratory Animal Center of Seoul\nNational University with ACUC permission for studying\nacupuncture meridian systems. The following is a representative example of surgery operation with a rat, and\nthe time varies depending upon the subject animal and\nthe details of operation. The procedure for rabbits is\nsimilar.\nAn intravenous injection of 10% dextrose solution at\nthe left vena femoralis is started after anesthetization.\nAt 30th minute about 35ml dextrose is injected, and the\njugular vein is cut to bleed by itself. At 55th minute\nthe frontal side of the rat is incised, and internal organs,\nflesh, and side muscles are removed so that blood systems\nare exposed for operational ease. Around this time the\ndextrose injection is stopped. At 105th minute after beginning of the dextrose injection the search of the IBVD\nstarts from the inferior vena cava and lasts more than\ntwo hours taking samples from various blood vessels.\n\n\f2\n\nFIG. 2: Bifurcation of a BongHan duct\nFIG. 1: An intravascular duct in an inferior vena cava\n\nWe do not understand the mechanism of the 10% dextrose solution which seems to help the IBVD to become\nthicker, and stronger so that it is easily noticeable and\nto be stretched out long. Without the dextrose solution\nthe IBVD is too thin and weak to be seen.\nThe IBVD is buried inside a string of fibrins with blood\ncoagulated around it, and becomes thick, which is the\nreason we can find it inside the opened vessel. The blood\nclot is dissolved by urokinase treatment. One vial of fibrinolytic agent urokinase 100,000 I.U. is dissolved in 100ml\nsaline water. The IBVD with blood clot is immersed into\nthe urokinase solution at about 37 for two or three\nhours to obtain the IBVD inside the fibrin string.\n\n\u0089\n\nFIG. 3: Entangled BongHan ducts inside atrium\nIII.\n\nRESULTS\n\nBasic properties of the IBVD are in agreement with\nBongHan theory.[2, 3] They are soft, elastic, and semitransparent. Their diameters are about 50\u03bcm. The\nIBVD has many smaller tubules like a bundle bound with\nfiber. The small tubule is about 10\u03bcm in diameter, and\nis stained well with methylene blue (0.02%)\nAn example of IBVD coagulated with fibrin inside the\nincised inferior vena cava is shown in Fig.1 The IBVD\nstarts from above the tip of the syringe needle. (gauge\n23, 5ml/cc), and is parallel with the needle\nFig.2 shows that an IBVD bifurcates to two IBVDs\nwhere the inferior vena cava branches to the left and right\niliac veins. This branching is in complete agreement with\nBongHan theory.\nEntangled BongHan tubules which was found inside\natrium is shown in Fig.3. BongHan theory also claims\nthat there are multiple of IBVDs inside a heart.\nWe observed an IBVD inside the abdominal aorta that\nis hold by several two-threads stretched out to the vessel\nwall like a ladder. The distances between the rungs are\nabout 1.5cm. Those side threads might be smaller IBVDs\n\nor simply attaching fibers which requires further studies.\nIV.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nIt is an immediate question that why the IBVD is not\nfound in surgeries which have been done millions of times.\nThe main reason is that the IBVD itself is too thin, semitransparent, and weak to be detected or captured unless\nspecial care is taken. In an ordinary surgery a divided\nIBVD shrivels and is enshrouded with blood clots which\ncan not be restored unless treated by urokinase or similar\nmaterial.\nOur method is to inject 10% dextrose solution which\nmakes the IBVD thicker and stronger by fibrins of coagulated blood around it. The IBVD may be a 'seed' for\nfibrins to gather around it, and dextrose may enhance\nthis effect. It requires further studies to find the mechanism of this phenomenon. Another effect of the dextrose\nsolution is to dilute blood inside the vessel so that the\nblood clotted IBVD is more noticeable because the diluted blood becomes almost transparent. Without such\n\n\f3\ndiluted blood the IBVD can not be seen easily.\nIt is possible to mistake a string of coagulated fibrins\nfor the IBVD when taking samples. The fibrin-string\ndoes not have tubular substructures. Furthermore it is\nvery improbable that the fibrin-string without the 'seed'\nof the IBVD branches to two pieces at the same anatomical positions for all the rats.\nThe limitation of our method is that it applies to the\nBongHan ducts only inside blood vessels. Nevertheless,\nthis confirmation of BongHan theory is the first one ever\nachieved, and will open vast areas of work for biological\nand medical research, and Traditional Korean Medicine.\nTaking just one example, we might wonder what is the\neffect of surgery when BongHan ducts are left cut and\n\ndisconnected.\n\n[1] X.
