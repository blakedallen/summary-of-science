New fixed point results are presented for Uc\u03ba (X, X) maps in extension type\nspaces.\nKeywords.\n\nComposite maps; fixed points; extension spaces.\n\n1. Introduction\nIn this paper we present new fixed point results in extension type spaces. In particular,\nwe present results for compact upper semicontinuous Uc\u03ba (X, X) maps where X is almost\nES dominating or more generally almost Schauder admissible dominating (these concepts will be defined in \u00a72). The results in this paper improve those in the literature (see\n[3,4,5,9,11] and the references therein). A continuation theorem is also discussed when\nthe maps are between topological vector spaces.\nFor the remainder of this section we present some definitions and known results which\nwill be needed throughout this paper. Suppose X and Y are topological spaces. Given a\nclass X of maps, X (X,Y ) denotes the set of maps F: X \u2192 2Y (nonempty subsets of Y )\nbelonging to X , and Xc the set of finite compositions of maps in X . We let\nF (X ) = {Z: Fix F 6= 0/\n\nfor all F \u2208 X (Z, Z)} ,\n\nwhere Fix F denotes the set of fixed points of F.\nU will be the class of maps [11] with the following properties:\n(i) U contains the class C of single valued continuous functions;\n(ii) each F \u2208 Uc is upper semicontinuous and compact valued; and\n(iii) Bn \u2208 F (Uc ) for all n \u2208 {1, 2, . . .}; here Bn = {x \u2208 Rn : kxk \u2264 1}.\nUc\u03ba (X,Y ) will consist of all maps F: X \u2192 2Y such that for each F and each nonempty\ncompact subset K of X there exists a map G \u2208 Uc (K,Y ) such that G(x) \u2286 F(x) for all\nx \u2208 K.\nRecall [9] that Uc\u03ba is closed under compositions. We also discuss special examples\nof Uc\u03ba maps. Let X and Y be subsets of Hausdorff topological vector spaces E1 and\n339\n\n\f340\n\nRavi P Agarwal, Jong Kyu Kim and Donal O'Regan\n\nE2 respectively. We will consider maps F: X \u2192 K(Y ); here K(Y ) denotes the family of\nnonempty compact subsets of Y . We say F: X \u2192 K(Y ) is Kakutani if F is upper semicontinuous with convex values. A nonempty topological space is said to be acyclic if all its\nreduced C\u0306ech homology groups over the rationals are trivial. Now F: X \u2192 K(Y ) is acyclic\nif F is upper semicontinuous with acyclic values. F: X \u2192 K(Y ) is said to be an O'Neill\nmap if F is continuous and if the values of F consist of one or m acyclic components (here\nm is fixed).\nGiven two open neighborhoods U and V of the origins in E1 and E2 repectively, a\n(U,V )-approximate continuous selection of F: X \u2192 K(Y ) is a continuous function s: X \u2192\nY satisfying\ns(x) \u2208 (F [(x + U) \u2229 X] + V ) \u2229Y\n\nfor every x \u2208 X.\n\nWe say F: X \u2192 K(Y ) is approximable if it is upper semicontinuous and if its restriction\nF|K to any compact subset K of X admits a (U,V )-approximate continuous selection for\nevery open neighborhood U and V of the origins in E1 and E2 respectively.\nFor our next definition let X and Y be metric spaces. A continuous single-valued map\np: Y \u2192 X is called a Vietoris map if the following two conditions are satisfied:\n(i) for each x \u2208 X, the set p\u22121 (x) is acyclic;\n(ii) p is a proper map i.e. for every compact A \u2286 X we have that p\u22121 (A) is compact.\nDEFINITION 1.1.\nA multifunction \u03c6 : X \u2192 K(Y ) is admissible (strongly) in the sense of Gorniewicz, if\n\u03c6 : X \u2192 K(Y ) is upper semicontinuous, and if there exists a metric space Z and two continuous maps p: Z \u2192 X and q: Z \u2192 Y such that\n(i) p is a Vietoris map, and\n(ii) \u03c6 (x) = q(p\u22121 (x)) for any x \u2208 X.\nIt should be noted that \u03c6 upper semicontinuous is redundant in Definition 1.1. Notice\nthe Kakutani maps, the acyclic maps, the O'Neill maps, the approximable maps and the\nmaps admissible in the sense of Gorniewicz are examples of Uc\u03ba maps.\n\n2. Fixed point theory\nWe begin with a result which extends results in the literature [3,11] for Uc\u03ba maps. In this\npaper by a space we mean a Hausdorff topological space. Let Q be a class of topological\nspaces. A space Y is an extension space for Q (written Y \u2208 ES(Q)) if \u2200X \u2208 Q, \u2200K \u2286 X\nclosed in X, any continuous function f0 : K \u2192 Y extends to a continuous function f : X \u2192\nY . The following result was established in [4].\nTheorem 2.1. Let X \u2208 ES(compact) and F \u2208 Uc\u03ba (X, X) a compact map. Then F has a\nfixed point.\nWe begin with topological vector spaces, so let E be a Hausdorff topological vector\nspace and X \u2286 E. Let V be a neighborhood of the origin 0 in E. X is said to be ES\n\n\fFixed point theory for composite maps\n\n341\n\nV-dominated if there exists a space XV \u2208 ES(compact) and two continuous functions\nrV : XV \u2192 X, sV : X \u2192 XV such that x \u2212 rV sV (x) \u2208 V for all x \u2208 X. X is said to be almost\nES dominated if X is ES V -dominated for every neighborhood V of the origin 0 in E.\nAny space that is dominated by a normed space (or more generally a complete metric\ntopological space admissible in the sense of Klee) is almost ES dominated.\nTheorem 2.2. Let X be a subset of a Hausdorff topological vector space E. Also assume\nX is almost ES dominated and that F \u2208 Uc\u03ba (X, X) is a compact closed map. Then F has\na fixed point.\nProof. Let N be a fundamental system of neighborhoods of the origin 0 in E and V \u2208\nN . Let K = F(X). Now there exists xV \u2208 ES(compact) and two continuous functions\nrV : XV \u2192 X, sV : X \u2192 XV such that x \u2212 rV sV (x) \u2208 V for all x \u2208 X.\nLet us look at the map GV = sV FrV . Since Uc\u03ba is closed under compositions we have\nthat GV \u2208 Uc\u03ba (XV , XV ) is a compact map. Now Theorem 2.1 guarantees that there exists\nzV \u2208 XV with zV \u2208 sV FrV (zV ) i.e. zV = sV (xV ) for some xV \u2208 FrV (zV ). In particular\nrV (zV ) = rV sV (xV ) so xV \u2208 FrV (zV ) = FrV sV (xV ).\nLet yV = rV sV (xV ). Then xV \u2208 FyV and since x \u2212 rV sV (x) \u2208 V for all x \u2208 X we have\nxV \u2212 yV \u2208 V . Now since K = F(X) is compact we may assume without loss of generality\nthat there exists a x with xV \u2192 x. Also since xV \u2212 yV \u2208 V we have yV \u2192 x. These together\nwith the facts that F is closed and xV \u2208 F(yV ) implies x \u2208 F(x).\n\u2737\nLet Q be a class of topological spaces and let Y be a subset of a Hausdorff topological\nvector space. Y is a Klee approximate extension space for Q (written Y \u2208 KAES(Q)) if\nfor all neighborhoods V of 0, \u2200X \u2208 Q, \u2200K \u2286 X closed in X, and any continuous function\nf0 : K \u2192 Y , there exists a continuous function fV : X \u2192 Y with fV (x) \u2212 f0 (x) \u2208 V for all\nx \u2208 K.\nLet E be a Hausdorff topological vector space and X \u2286 E. We say X is KAES admissible if for every compact subset K of X and every neighborhood V of 0 there exists a\ncontinuous function hV : K \u2192 X such that\n(i) x \u2212 hV (x) \u2208 V for all x \u2208 K and\n(ii) hV (K) is contained in a subset C of X with C \u2208 KAES(compact).\nThe following result was established in [3].\nTheorem 2.3. Let X be a subset of a Hausdorff topological vector space E. Also assume\nX is KAES admissible and that F \u2208 Uc\u03ba (X, X) is a upper semicontinuous compact map\nwith closed values. Then F has a fixed point.\nLet E be a Hausdorff topological vector space and X \u2286 E. Let V be a neighborhood of\nthe origin 0 in E. X is said to be KAES V -dominated if there exists a KAES admissible\nspace XV and two continuous functions rV : XV \u2192 X, sV : X \u2192 XV such that x\u2212 rV sV (x) \u2208 V\nfor all x \u2208 X. X is said to be almost KAES dominated if X is KAES V -dominated for every\nneighborhood V of the origin 0 in E.\nEssentially the same reasoning as in Theorem 2.2 (except here we use Theorem 2.3)\nyields the following result.\nTheorem 2.4. Let X be a subset of a Hausdorff topological vector space E. Also assume\nX is almost KAES dominated and that F \u2208 Uc\u03ba (X, X) is a compact upper semicontinuous\nmap with closed values. Then F has a fixed point.\n\n\f342\n\nRavi P Agarwal, Jong Kyu Kim and Donal O'Regan\n\nLet X be a subset of a Hausdorff topological vector space. Then X is said to be qalmost KAES dominated if any nonempty compact convex subset \u03a9 of X is almost KAES\ndominated.\nTheorem 2.5. Let X be a closed convex q-almost KAES dominated subset of a Hausdorff\ntopological vector space with x0 \u2208 X. Suppose F \u2208 Uc\u03ba (X, X) is a upper semicontinuous\nmap with closed values and assume the following condition holds:\nIf A \u2286 X with A = co({x0 } \u222a F(A)), then A is compact.\n\n(2.1)\n\nThen F has a fixed point.\nProof. Consider F the family of all closed, convex subsets C of X with x0 \u2208 C and F(x) \u2286\nC for all x \u2208 C and let C0 = \u2229C\u2208F C. Now [2] guarantees that\nC0 = co ({x0 } \u222a F(C0 )).\n\n(2.2)\n\nNow (2.1) guarantees that C0 is compact and (2.2) implies F(C0 ) \u2286 C0 . Also C0 is almost\nKAES dominated. In addition F|C0 \u2208 Uc\u03ba (C0 ,C0 ) is a compact upper semicontinuous map\nwith closed values so Theorem 2.4 guarantees that there exists x0 \u2208 C with x0 \u2208 Fx0 . \u2737\nNext we present a continuation theorem. Let E be a Hausdorff topological vector space,\nC a closed convex subset of E, U an open subset of C and 0 \u2208 U. We would like to consider\nmaps F: U \u2192 K(C) which are upper semicontinuous and either (a) Kakutani; (b) acyclic;\n(c) O'Neill; (d) approximable; or (e) admissible (strongly) in the sense of Gorniewicz.\nHere U denotes the closure of U in C.\nTo take care of all the above maps (and even more general types) we define as follows.\nDEFINITION 2.1.\nF \u2208 GA(U,C) if F: U \u2192 K(C) is upper semicontinuous and satisfies condition (C).\nWe assume condition (C) as:\n(\nfor any map F \u2208 GA(U,C) and any continuous single-valued\n(2.3)\nmap \u03bc : U \u2192 [0, 1] we have that \u03bc F satisfies condition (C).\nCertainly if condition (C) means (a), (b), (c), (d) or (e) above, then (2.3) holds.\nWe assume the map F: U \u2192 K(C) satisfies one of the following conditions:\n(H1) F: U \u2192 K(C) is compact;\n(H2) if D \u2286 U and D \u2286 co ({0} \u222a F(D)) then D is compact.\nFix i \u2208 {1, 2}.\nDEFINITION 2.2.\nWe say F \u2208 GAi (U,C) if F \u2208 GA(U,C) satisfies (Hi).\nDEFINITION 2.3.\nWe say F \u2208 GAi\u2202 U (U,C) if F \u2208 GAi (U,C) with x \u2208\n/ F(x) for x \u2208 \u2202 U; here \u2202 U denotes the\nboundary of U in C.\n\n\fFixed point theory for composite maps\n\n343\n\nDEFINITION 2.4.\nA map F \u2208 GA\u2202i U (U,C) is essential in GAi\u2202 U (U,C) if for every G \u2208 GAi\u2202 U (U,C) with\nG|\u2202 U = F|\u2202 U there exists x \u2208 U with x \u2208 G(x).\nThe following result was established in [1].\nTheorem 2.6. Fix i \u2208 {1, 2}. Let E be a Hausdorff topological vector space, C a closed\nconvex subset of E, U an open subset of C, 0 \u2208 U and assume (2.3) holds. Suppose\nF \u2208 GAi (U,C) and assume the following two conditions are satisfied:\nthe zero map is essential in GA\u2202i U (U,C)\n\n(2.4)\n\nx\u2208\n/ \u03bb Fx\n\n(2.5)\n\nand\nfor x \u2208 \u2202 U\n\nand \u03bb \u2208 (0, 1].\n\nThen F is essential in GA\u2202i U (U,C).\nNext we discuss Assumption (2.4). The results presented were motivated partly by [10].\nExample 2.1. Let i = 1. Suppose condition (C) in Definition 2.1 means F: U \u2192 K(C) is\neither (a) Kakutani; (b) acyclic; (c) O'Neill; or (d) approximable, and assume C is almost\nKAES dominated. Then (2.3) and (2.4) hold.\nTo see (2.4) let \u03b8 \u2208 GA\u22021 U (U,C) with \u03b8 |\u2202 U = {0}. We must show that there exists\nx \u2208 U with x \u2208 \u03b8 (x). Let\n(\n\u03b8 (x), x \u2208 U\nJ(x) =\n{0}, otherwise.\nIt is easy to see that J: C \u2192 K(C) is (a) Kakutani if \u03b8 is Kakutani, (b) acyclic if \u03b8 is\nacyclic, (c) O'Neill if \u03b8 is O'Neill or (d) approximable [10] if \u03b8 is approximable. Clearly\nJ: C \u2192 K(C) is compact. Now Theorem 2.4 guarantees that there exists x \u2208 C with x \u2208\nJ(x). If x \u2208\n/ U we have x \u2208 J(x) = {0}, which is a contradiction since 0 \u2208 U. Thus x \u2208 U\nso x \u2208 J(x) = \u03b8 (x).\nExample 2.2. Let i = 2. Suppose condition (C) in Definition 2.1 means F: U \u2192 K(C) is\neither (a) Kakutani; (b) acyclic; (c)'O'Neill; or (d) approximable, and assume C is closed,\nconvex and q-almost KAES dominated. Also suppose\nco (K) is compact for any compact subset K of C.\n\n(2.6)\n\nThen (2.3) and (2.4) hold.\nTo see (2.4) let \u03b8 \u2208 GA2\u2202 U (U,C) with \u03b8 |\u2202 U = {0} and let J be as in Example 2.1. Again\nJ: C \u2192 K(C) is (a) Kakutani if \u03b8 is Kakutani, (b) acyclic if \u03b8 is acyclic, (c) O'Neill if \u03b8\nis O'Neill, or (d) approximable if \u03b8 is approximable. Next we show that J satisfies (2.1)\n(with F replaced by J and x0 by 0). To see this let D \u2286 C with D = co ({0} \u222a J(D)). Then\nD \u2286 co ({0} \u222a \u03b8 (D \u2229U)),\nand so\nD \u2229U \u2286 co ({0} \u222a \u03b8 (D \u2229U)).\n\n(2.7)\n\n\f344\n\nRavi P Agarwal, Jong Kyu Kim and Donal O'Regan\n\nSince \u03b8 \u2208 GA2 (U,C) we have that D \u2229U is compact. In addition \u03b8 upper semicontinuous guarantees \u0001that \u03b8 (D \u2229U) is compact, and this together with (2.6) implies that\nco {0} \u222a \u03b8 (D \u2229U) is compact. Now (2.7) implies D (= D) is compact, so (2.1) holds.\nTheorem 2.5 guarantees that there exists x \u2208 C with x \u2208 J(x). As in Example 2.1 we have\nx \u2208 U so x \u2208 J(x) = \u03b8 (x).\nNext we extend the results of this section to Hausdorff topological spaces. First we\ngather together some preliminaries. For a subset K of a topological space X, we denote\nby CovX (K) the set of all coverings of K by open sets of X (usually we write Cov(K) =\nCovX (K)). Given a map F: X \u2192 2X and \u03b1 \u2208 Cov(X), a point x \u2208 X is said to be an \u03b1 fixed point of F if there exists a member U \u2208 \u03b1 such that x \u2208 U and F(x) \u2229U 6= 0.\n/ Given\ntwo maps F, G: X \u2192 2Y and \u03b1 \u2208 Cov(Y ), F and G are said to be \u03b1 -close if for any x \u2208 X\nthere exists Ux \u2208 \u03b1 , y \u2208 F(x) \u2229Ux and w \u2208 G(x) \u2229Ux .\nThe following result can be found in [5].\nTheorem 2.7. Let X be a regular topological space and F: X \u2192 2X an upper semicontinuous map with closed values. Suppose there exists a cofinal family of coverings\n\u03b8 \u2286 CovX (F(X)) such that F has an \u03b1 -fixed point for every \u03b1 \u2208 \u03b8 . Then F has a fixed\npoint.\nRemark 2.1. From Theorem 2.7 in proving the existence of fixed points in uniform spaces\nfor upper semicontinuous compact maps with closed values it suffices (p. 298 of [6]) to\nprove the existence of approximate fixed points (since open covers of a compact set A\nadmit refinements of the form {U[x]: x \u2208 A} where U is a member of the uniformity\n(p. 199 of [8]) and such refinements form a cofinal family of open covers). Note also\nthat uniform spaces are regular (in fact completely regular) (p. 431 of [7]). Note in Theorem 2.7 if F is compact valued then the assumption that X is regular can be removed. For\nconvenience, in this paper we will apply Theorem 2.7 only when the space is uniform.\nLet X be a Hausdorff topological space and let \u03b1 \u2208 Cov(X). X is said to be ES\n\u03b1 -dominated if there exists a space X\u03b1 \u2208 ES(compact) and two continuous functions\nr\u03b1 : X\u03b1 \u2192 X, s\u03b1 : X \u2192 X\u03b1 such that r\u03b1 s\u03b1 : X \u2192 X and i: X \u2192 X are \u03b1 -close. X is said to\nbe almost ES dominated if X is ES \u03b1 -dominated for each \u03b1 \u2208 Cov(X).\nTheorem 2.8. Let X be a uniform space and let X be almost ES dominated. Also suppose\nF \u2208 Uc\u03ba (X, X) is a compact upper semicontinuous map with closed values. Then F has a\nfixed point.\nProof. Let K = F(X) and \u03b1 \u2208 CovX (K). Now there exists X\u03b1 \u2208 ES(compact) and two\ncontinuous functions r\u03b1 : X\u03b1 \u2192 X, s\u03b1 : X \u2192 X\u03b1 such that r\u03b1 s\u03b1 and i are \u03b1 -close. Notice\ns\u03b1 Fr\u03b1 \u2208 Uc\u03ba (X\u03b1 , X\u03b1 ) so Theorem 2.1 guarantees that there exists z\u03b1 \u2208 X\u03b1 with z\u03b1 \u2208\ns\u03b1 Fr\u03b1 (z\u03b1 ) i.e. z\u03b1 = s\u03b1 (x\u03b1 ) for some x\u03b1 \u2208 Fr\u03b1 (z\u03b1 ). Notice x\u03b1 \u2208 Fr\u03b1 s\u03b1 (x\u03b1 ) also. Let\ny\u03b1 = r\u03b1 s\u03b1 (x\u03b1 ) and note x\u03b1 \u2208 Fy\u03b1 . Since r\u03b1 s\u03b1 and i are \u03b1 -close there exists U\u03b1 \u2208 \u03b1\nwith r\u03b1 s\u03b1 (x\u03b1 ) \u2208 U\u03b1 and x\u03b1 \u2208 U\u03b1 i.e. y\u03b1 \u2208 U\u03b1 and x\u03b1 \u2208 U\u03b1 . As a result y\u03b1 \u2208 U\u03b1 and\nF(y\u03b1 ) \u2229U\u03b1 6= 0/ since x\u03b1 \u2208 F(y\u03b1 ) and x\u03b1 \u2208 U\u03b1 . Thus F has an \u03b1 -fixed point. The result\nnow follows from Theorem 2.7 (with Remark 2.1).\n\u2737\nLet Q be a class of topological spaces and Y a subset of a Hausdorff topological space.\nA space Y is an approximate extension space for Q (written Y \u2208 AES(Q)) if \u2200 \u03b1 \u2208 Cov(Y ),\n\n\fFixed point theory for composite maps\n\n345\n\n\u2200X \u2208 Q, \u2200K \u2286 X closed in X, and any continuous function f0 : K \u2192 Y , there exists a\ncontinuous function f : X \u2192 Y such that f |K is \u03b1 -close to f0 .\nLet X be a uniform space. Then X is Schauder admissible if for every compact subset\nK of X and every covering \u03b1 \u2208 CovX (K), there exists a continuous function (called the\nSchauder projection) \u03c0\u03b1 : K \u2192 X such that\n(i) \u03c0\u03b1 and i: K \u0592\u2192 X are \u03b1 -close;\n(ii) \u03c0\u03b1 (K) is contained in a subset C \u2286 X with C \u2208 AES(compact).\nThe following result was established in [9].\nTheorem 2.9. Let X be a uniform space and assume X is Schauder admissible. Suppose\nF \u2208 Uc\u03ba (X, X) is a compact upper semicontinuous map with closed values. Then F has a\nfixed point.\nLet X be a Hausdorff topological space and let \u03b1 \u2208 Cov(X). X is said to be Schauder\nadmissible \u03b1 -dominated if there exists a Schauder admissible space X\u03b1 and two continuous functions r\u03b1 : X\u03b1 \u2192 X, s\u03b1 : X \u2192 X\u03b1 such that r\u03b1 s\u03b1 : X \u2192 X and i: X \u2192 X are \u03b1 -close.\nX is said to be almost Schauder admissible dominated if X is Schauder admissible \u03b1 dominated for each \u03b1 \u2208 Cov(X).\nEssentially the same reasoning as in Theorem 2.8 (except here we use Theorem 2.9)\nyields the following result.\nTheorem 2.10. Let X be a uniform space and let X be almost Schauder admissible dominated. Also suppose F \u2208 Uc\u03ba (X, X) is a compact upper semicontinuous map with closed\nvalues. Then F has a fixed point.\n\nReferences\n[1] Agarwal R P and O'Regan D, Homotopy and Leray\u2013Schauder principles for multimaps,\nNonlinear Analysis Forum 7 (2002) 103\u2013111\n[2] Agarwal R P and O'Regan D, Collectively fixed point theorems, Nonlinear Analysis\nForum 7 (2002) 167\u2013179\n[3] Agarwal R P and O'Regan D, Fixed point theory for multimaps defined on admissible\nsubsets of topological vector spaces, Comm.
