Introduction and Outline of the Article\nWe shall be concerned with hypersurfaces of a semi-Riemannian manifold, for which\nthe real-valued second fundamental form II is a semi-Riemannian metrical tensor. The\ngeometry of such hypersurfaces can be explored with respect to either the first or the\nsecond fundamental form.\nIn analogy with the classical study of the geometry of hypersurfaces as determined by\ntheir first fundamental form, a distinction can be made between the intrinsic geometry\nof the second fundamental form, which is determined by measurements of II-lengths on\nthe hypersurface only, and the extrinsic geometry of the second fundamental form, which\nconcerns those measurements for which the geometry of the second fundamental form of\nthe hypersurface is compared with the corresponding geometry of nearby hypersurfaces.\nThe Intrinsic Geometry of the Second Fundamental Form.\nIt is a natural question to investigate the relation between the intrinsic geometry of the\nsecond fundamental form and the shape of the original hypersurface, and for this purpose\nthe intrinsic curvatures of the second fundamental form have already been studied.\nFor example, it is well-known that the second fundamental form is a flat Lorentzian\nmetric on a minimal surface in E3 . Conversely, D.E. Blair and T. Koufogiorgos showed\nthat the pieces of a helicoid are the only non-developable ruled surfaces in E3 for which\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 53B25, 53A10, 53C42.\nKey words and phrases. second fundamental form, mean curvature, extrinsic hypersphere.\n\u22c6\nS.

Becker and W. K\u00fchnel showed\nthat the catenoid is the only surface of revolution in E3 for which the second fundamental\nform is a complete and flat Lorentzian metric [5].\nNumerous related characterisations of Euclidean spheres among ovaloids, i.e., among\ncompact hypersurfaces in a Euclidean space with a positive definite second fundamental\nform, have already been found. For example, R. Schneider's theorem characterises the\nhyperspheres as the only ovaloids for which the second fundamental form has constant\nsectional curvature [21]. Some generalisations of this theorem for surfaces in certain\nLorentzian manifolds have been found by J.A. Aledo, A. Romero, et al [2, 3].\nHowever, in the present article we are not concerned with the geometry of the second\nfundamental form from the intrinsic point of view, but we will study an aspect of the\nextrinsic geometry of the second fundamental form.\nThe Extrinsic Geometry of the Second Fundamental Form.\nAs is known, the mean curvature H of a hypersurface of a semi-Riemannian manifold\ndescribes the instantaneous response of the area functional with respect to deformations\nof the hypersurface. Since we are studying hypersurfaces for which the second fundamental\nform is a semi-Riemannian metrical tensor, areas can be measured with respect to the\nsecond fundamental form as well, so we can associate to any such hypersurface M its area\nas measured in the geometry of the second fundamental form. This area, which will be\ndenoted by AreaII (M), is related to the classical area element d\u03a9 by\nZ p\n|detA| d\u03a9 ,\nAreaII (M) =\nM\n\nwhere A denotes the shape operator of the hypersurface.\nIn this article, the notion of mean curvature will be tailored to the geometry of the\nsecond fundamental form: the function which measures the rate of change of AreaII (M)\nunder a deformation of M, will be called the mean curvature of the second fundamental\nform and denoted by HII . In this way, a concept which belongs to the extrinsic geometry\nof the second fundamental form will be introduced in analogy with a well-known concept\nin the classical theory of hypersurfaces. The mean curvature of the second fundamental\nform was defined originally by E. Gl\u00e4ssner [11, 12] for surfaces in E3 . The corresponding\nvariational problem has been studied by F. Dillen and W. Sodsiri [9] for surfaces in E31 ,\nand for Riemannian surfaces in a three-dimensional semi-Riemannian manifold in [16].\nSome characterisations of the spheres in which this curvature HII is involved have been\nfound. For example, it has been shown that the spheres are the only ovaloids in E3 which\n\u221a\nsatisfy HII = C K; furthermore, the spheres are the only ovaloids on which HII \u2212 KII\ndoes not change sign (see [24] and G. Stamou's [23]).\nIn the initiating \u00a7 2 of this article, the notation will be explained and several useful\nformulae from the theory of hypersurfaces will be briefly recalled.\n\n\fTHE MEAN CURVATURE OF THE SECOND FUNDAMENTAL FORM\n\n3\n\nIn the following \u00a7 3, the first variation of the area functional of the second fundamental\nform is calculated and the mean curvature of the second fundamental form is defined.\nIn \u00a7 4, a comparison result for the Levi-Civita connections of the first and the second\nfundamental form, which will be used in some of the subsequent proofs, is established.\nIn the subsequent sections (\u00a7\u00a7 5\u20137) the mean curvature of the second fundamental\nform will be employed to give several characterisations of extrinsic hyperspheres as the\nonly hypersurfaces in space forms, an Einstein space, and a three-dimensional manifold,\nrespectively, which can satisfy certain inequalities in which the mean curvature of the\nsecond fundamental form is involved.\nIn \u00a7 8 the expresssion for HII will be investigated for curves. This is of particular interest,\nsince the length of the second fundamental form of a curve \u03b3,\nZ p\n|\u03ba| ds ,\nLengthII (\u03b3) =\n\n(where \u03ba is the geodesic curvature and s an arc-length parameter) is a modification of the\nclassical bending energy\nZ\n\u03ba2 ds\n\nwhich has already been studied by D. Bernoulli and L. Euler. Moreover, the results we\npresent agree with W. Blaschke's description of J. Radon's variational problem [6] and\nwith a more recent article of J. Arroyo, O.J. Garay and J.J. Menc\u0131\u0301a [4].\nIn the final section, \u00a7 9, the function HII will be investigated for (sufficiently small)\ngeodesic hyperspheres in a Riemannian manifold by means of the method of power series\nexpansions, which was applied extensively by A. Gray [13], and also by B.-Y. Chen and L.\nVanhecke [8, 14]. Furthermore, we address the question of whether the locally flat spaces\nare characterised by the property that every geodesic hypersphere has the same II-area as\na Euclidean hypersphere with the same radius.\n2. Definitions, Notation, and Useful Formulae\n2.1. Assumption. All hypersurfaces are understood to be embedded and connected.\n2.2. Nomenclature. A hypersurface in a semi-Riemannian manifold is said to be (semi-)\nRiemannian if the restriction of the metric to the hypersurface is a (semi-)Riemannian\nmetrical tensor.\n\n2.3. Notation. Since a hypersurface M in a manifold M will be studied, geometric objects in M are distinguished from their analogues in M with a bar. Geometric entities\nderived from the second fundamental form are distinguished from those derived from the\nfirst fundamental form by means of a sub- or superscript II. For example, the area element\nobtained from the second fundamental form will be written as d\u03a9II .\n\n\f4\n\nSTEFAN HAESEN, STEVEN VERPOORT\n\n2.4. Notation. The set of all vector fields on a manifold M will be denoted by X(M).\nFurthermore, F(M) stands for the set of all real-valued functions on M. If (M, g) is a semi-Riemannian submanifold of a semi-Riemannian manifold (M , g), the set of all vector\nfields on M which take values in the tangent bundle TM is denoted by X(M). The\northogonal projection Tp M \u2192 Tp M will be denoted by [*]T .\n2.5. The Laplacian. The sign of the Laplacian will be chosen so that \u2206f = f \u2032\u2032 for a\nreal-valued function on R.\n2.6. The fundamental forms. Let M be a semi-Riemannian hypersurface of dimension\nm in a semi-Riemannian manifold (M, g). We shall suppose that a unit normal vector field\nU \u2208 X(M) has been chosen on M. The shape operator A, the second fundamental form\nII and the third fundamental form III of the hypersurface M are defined by the formulae\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\nX(M)\n\u2192 X(M) :\nV\n7\u2192\n\u2212\u2207V U ;\n\uf8f2 A :\n(1)\nII : X(M) \u00d7 X(M) \u2192 F(M) : (V, W ) 7\u2192 \u03b1 g(A(V ), W ) ;\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 III : X(M) \u00d7 X(M) \u2192 F(M) : (V, W ) 7\u2192 g(A(V ), A(W )) ,\nwhere \u03b1 = g(U, U) = \u00b11. It will be assumed that the second fundamental form is a\nsemi-Riemannian metric on M.\n\n2.7. Frame fields. Let {E1 , . . . , Em } denote a frame field on M which is orthonormal\nwith respect to the first fundamental form g. Define \u03b5i (i = 1, . . . , m) by \u03b5i = g(Ei , Ei ) =\n\u00b11. Furthermore, let {V1 , . . . , Vm } be a frame field on M which is orthonormal with\nrespect to the second fundamental form II. Define \u03bai (i = 1, . . . , m) by \u03bai = II(Vi , Vi ) = \u00b11.\n2.8. Curvature. The following convention concerning the Riemann-Christoffel curvature\ntensor R will be made: for X, Y, Z \u2208 X(M), we define R(X, Y )Z = \u2207[X,Y ] Z \u2212 \u2207X \u2207Y Z +\n\u2207Y \u2207X Z. The Ricci tensor and the scalar curvature will be denoted by Ric and S. The\nmean curvature H of the hypersurface M is defined by\nm\n\n\u03b1\n1 X\nH = tr(A) =\nII(Ei , Ei )\u03b5i .\nm\nm i=1\nThe (M, g)-sectional curvature of the plane spanned by two vectors vp and wp in Tp M,\nwill be denoted by K(vp , wp ). The symbols K II (vp , wp ) and K(vp , wp ) will be used in accordance with the remark of \u00a7 2.3. Similarly, the scalar curvature of the second fundamental\nform will be denoted by SII .\n2.9. The difference tensor L. The difference tensor L between the two Levi-Civita\nconnections \u2207II and \u2207 is defined by\nL(X, Y ) = \u2207IIX Y \u2212 \u2207X Y ,\n\n\fTHE MEAN CURVATURE OF THE SECOND FUNDAMENTAL FORM\n\n(parallel transport w.r.t. \u2207II )\n\n(parallel transport w.r.t. \u2207)\nv\u03b5\u2022\n\nv\u03b5\u2022\n\nv\u03b5\u22c6\n\nv\n\u03b3(\u03b5)\n\nv\n\nb\n\n\u03b3(\u03b5)\n\nb\nb\n\np = \u03b3(0)\n\n5\n\nb\n\nb\n\nb\n\nb\n\np = \u03b3(0)\n\nw\n\nb\n\nw\n\nFigure 1.

This definition extends those of [11, 12]; in [16], the sign of HII was chosen\ndifferently.\nExample 7. The standard embedding of Sm ( \u221a12 ) in Sm+1 (1) is II-minimal. Furthermore,\nthe standard embedding of Sk ( \u221a12 ) \u00d7 Sm\u2212k ( \u221a12 ) in Sm+1 (1) (see, e.g., [18]) is a II-minimal\nhypersurface (k = 1, . . . , m \u2212 1). These assertions can be proved with ease when one takes\ninto account the fact that these hypersurfaces are parallel (in the sense that \u2207II = 0).\nRemark 8.

A comparison Result for the Connections\n\nIn the sequel of this article we will make use of the following Lemma, which slightly\nextends well-known results ([17] Thm. 7, [22], and [10], Cor. 13). First we recall a useful\ndefinition.\nDefinition 11. A totally umbilical, compact hypersurface M of a semi-Riemannian manifold (M, g) which satisfies A = \u03c1 id for a constant \u03c1 \u2208 R, is called an extrinsic hypersphere.\nLemma 12. Let M be a compact hypersurface of a semi-Riemannian manifold (M , g).\nSuppose that both the first and the second fundamental forms are positive definite and that\nthese metrical tensors induce the same Levi-Civita connection. Furthermore, assume that\n(M, g) has either strictly positive or strictly negative sectional curvature. Then M is an\nextrinsic hypersphere.\nProof. (First Version.) As an immediate consequence of \u2207 = \u2207II , we see that\nR(X, Y )Z = RII (X, Y )Z\nholds for all X, Y, Z \u2208 X(M). Let p \u2208 M be an arbitrary point and choose an orthonormal\nbasis {E1 (p), . . . , Em (p)} as in Remark 8:\nA(Ei (p)) = \u03bbi (p) Ei (p)\n\n(i = 1, . . . , m) .\n\nThese vectors can be extended to a smooth orthonormal frame field {E1 , . . . , Em } on a\nneighbourhood of p in M. For any choice of i 6= j \u2208 {1, . . . , m}, there holds\n\u0013\n\u0012\nII(RII (Ei , Ej )Ei , Ej )\nII\nK (Ei (p), Ej (p)) =\nII(Ei , Ei )II(Ej , Ej ) (p)\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03b1\u03bbj g(R(Ei , Ej )Ei , Ej )\n=\n\u03bbi \u03bbj\n(p)\n\u03b1\n=\nK(Ei (p), Ej (p)) .\n\u03bbi (p)\n\n\fTHE MEAN CURVATURE OF THE SECOND FUNDAMENTAL FORM\n\n9\n\nSince the above equation remains valid if the r\u00f4le of i and j is interchanged whereas\nK(Ei (p), Ej (p)) 6= 0, it follows that M is totally umbilical. This means that A = \u03c1 id for\na function \u03c1 : M \u2192 R. Furthermore, for all X, Y, Z \u2208 X(M),\n\u0001\n0 = \u2207IIX II (Y, Z) = (\u2207X II) (Y, Z) = \u03b1X [\u03c1] g(Y, Z) .\nConsequently, \u03c1 is a constant.\n\n\u0003\n\nProof. (Second Version.) Assume that the conditions, as stated in the lemma, are satisfied\nfor a hypersurface which is not an extrinsic hypersphere. Thus the open set of all nonumbilical points on M is non-empty and a non-umbilical point p \u2208 M can be chosen, in a\nneighbourhood of which the principal directions {E1 , . . . , Em } are smooth. The fact that\np is non-umbilical means, after a possible re-numbering of indices, that\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\u03bb1 (p) = \u03bb2 (p) = * * * = \u03bbk (p) ;\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 \u03bb1 (p) 6= \u03bbk+1 (p) ;\n..\n\uf8f4\n.\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 \u03bb (p) 6= \u03bb (p) ,\n1\n\nm\n\nfor some k \u2208 {1, . . . , m \u2212 1} .\nSince the first and the second fundamental form induce the same Levi-Civita connection,\nthere holds \u2207A = 0. Thus for X \u2208 X(M) and i, j \u2208 {1, . . . , m}, we have\n0 = g ((\u2207X A)Ei , Ej ) = (\u03bbi \u2212 \u03bbj )g(\u2207X Ei , Ej ) \u2212 X[\u03bbi ]\u03b4i j ,\nand in particular,\n(6)\n\n0 = g(\u2207X Ei , Ej )\n\n(for 1 6 i 6 k < k + 1 6 j 6 m).\n\nNow choose a curve \u03b3 on M satisfying \u03b3(0) = p = \u03b3(1), and choose a vector vp \u2208\nspan {Ek+1 (p), . . . , Em (p)}. The vector field which is obtained by parallel translation of\nthis vector vp along the curve \u03b3 will be denoted by V = \u03be 1 E1 + * * * + \u03be m Em . Taking the\nfact (6) into account, we deduce that\n\uf8f1\nk\n1 \u2032\n2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 0 = g(\u2207\u03b3 \u2032 V, e1 ) = (\u03be ) + \u03be g(\u2207\u03b3 \u2032 E2 , E1 ) + * * * + \u03be g(\u2207\u03b3 \u2032 Ek , E1 ) ;\n..\n.\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n0 = g(\u2207\u03b3 \u2032 V, Ek ) = (\u03be)\u2032 + \u03be 1 g(\u2207\u03b3 \u2032 E1 , Ek ) + * * * + \u03be k\u22121 g(\u2207\u03b3 \u2032 Ek\u22121 , Ek ) .\n\nThe crucial remark which has to be made is that the functions \u03be k+1 , . . . , \u03be m do not enter\nin these equations because of (6), whence a system of first-order differential equations in\nthe functions \u03be 1 , . . . , \u03be k with initial conditions \u03be 1 (0) = 0, . . . , \u03be k (0) = 0 is obtained. The\nconclusion is that \u03be 1 \u2261 * * * \u2261 \u03be k \u2261 0.\nIt has thus been shown that the action of the local holonomy group leaves the subspace\nspan {Ek+1 (p), . . . , Em (p)} of Tp M invariant.\n\n\f10\n\nSTEFAN HAESEN, STEVEN VERPOORT\n\nNow the local de Rahm theorem can be applied, which gives us that a neighbourhood\nof p \u2208 (M, g) is isometric to a Cartesian product of Riemannian manifolds.

Such hypersurfaces\nwere classified in Theorem 4 of [18]. If C > 0, the only hypersurfaces with a positive definite second fundamental form which appear in this classification are the\nextrinsic hyperspheres. If C < 0, the extrinsic hyperspheres are the only compact\nhypersurfaces in the classification.\nm+1\n2. M e (C) is a Lorentzian space form with C 6 0. It follows from the Gauss\nequation that (M, g) has strictly negative sectional curvature. The result follows\nfrom Lemmas 12 and 13.\nm+1\n3. M e (C) is the de Sitter space. It follows from (8) that \u2207A vanishes. Consequently, M has constant mean curvature and an application of Theorem 4 of [20]\nconcludes the proof.\n\u0003\n6.

Surfaces in a three-dimensional semi-Riemannian Manifold\nAll previous results agree with [16] if the surrounding space is three-dimensional (except\nfor the sign convention of HII ). Moreover, some results can be sharpened. Assume M \u2208 E\nand m = 2. Let KII denote the Gaussian curvature of (M, II). Consequently, the relation\n2KII = SII is valid.\nTheorem 16. Let M be a compact surface in a three-dimensional semi-Riemannian manifold (M, g) and suppose that the first as well as the second fundamental form of M is\npositive definite.

Assume first that (10) is satisfied. A minor adaptation of the proof of Proposition 5\nof [16] shows that M is totally umbilical, and that equality is attained in (10). An\napplication of Theorem 6 of [16] shows that we have\n1\n1\nKII = \u03b1 HII + trII Ric \u2212 \u2206II log(detA) ,\n2\n4\nand consequently detA is a constant.

Let T denote the unit tangent vector \u03b3 \u2032 along \u03b3. It\nwill be supposed that g(\u2207T T, \u2207T T ) vanishes nowhere. By virtue of this property, \u03b3 is\nsometimes called a Frenet curve. On the other hand, this requirement precisely means\nthat II is a semi-Riemannian metrical tensor on \u03b3.

A curve \u03b3 (with \u03ba > 0) in E2 is II-minimal if and only if the curvature \u03ba,\nwhen regarded as a function of the arc-length, satisfies\n(12)\n\n4 \u03ba4 + 2 \u03ba \u03ba\u2032\u2032 \u2212 3(\u03ba\u2032 )2 = 0 .\n\nThis differential equation can most conveniently be solved by introducing the function\n\u03c6 = \u03ba1 .

This shows that\nthe catenaries are exactly the II-minimal planar curves. (Compare [6, \u00a7 27] for the corresponding variational problem for space curves.)\nRemark 19. It can be asked as well, whether a curve in E2 can be found which minimises\nLengthII among all curves with \u03ba > 0 joining two given points. This requirement is\nstronger than merely II-minimality of \u03b3, since non-compactly supported fixed-endpoint\nvariations of the curve should also be taken into account. A simple argument shows that\nno such minimum exists: if \u03b3R is an arc of a circle of radius R which joins the two given\npoints, there holds\nlim LengthII (\u03b3R ) = 0 .\n\nR\u2192\u221e\n\nExample 20. For curves on the unit sphere, the equation HII = 0 can be rewritten as\n4\u03ba2 \u2212 4\u03ba4 \u2212 2\u03ba\u2032\u2032 \u03ba + 3(\u03ba\u2032 )2 = 0 .\nThis is equation (4) of [4], if the length functional of the second fundamental form LengthII\nis interpreted as the so-called curvature energy functional. As is proved and beautifully\nillustrated in [4], there exists a discrete family of closed, immersed, II-minimal curves on\nthe unit sphere. Then S 1 ( \u221a12 ) \u2286 S 2 (1) is an embedded \"II-minimal\" curve which belongs\nto this family. This curve is, as is remarked in [4], actually a local maximum of AreaII .\n9. Geodesic Hyperspheres in a Riemannian Manifold\n9.1. Overview of the Results of this Section. As a final example we shall investigate the (sufficiently small) geodesic hyperspheres in a Riemannian manifold, since these\nprovide us with a naturally defined class of hypersurfaces with a positive definite second\nfundamental form. We will use the method of power series expansions, hereby relying on\ncomputations of [8, 13, 14].\nIt will first be shown (Theorem 22) that a Riemannian space for which the value of HII\nagrees for every geodesic hypersphere in any of its points with the corresponding value\nfor a hypersphere of the same radius in a Euclidean space, has to be locally flat.\nLet us next denote the geodesic hypersphere of centre n and radius r by Gn (r). It was\nasked in [14] whether the Riemannian geometry of the ambient manifold (M , g) is fully\ndetermined by the area functions\nM \u00d7 ]0, +\u221e[ \u2192 R : (n, r) 7\u2192 Area(Gn (r))\n\n(r sufficiently small)\n\n\fTHE MEAN CURVATURE OF THE SECOND FUNDAMENTAL FORM\n\n15\n\nof the geodesic hyperspheres. It appears that a decisive answer has not yet been given.\nSimilarly, it may be asked whether a Riemannian manifold for which every geodesic hypersphere has the same II-area as a Euclidean hypersphere of the same radius, is locally\nflat. In analogy with [14], we were only able to give an affirmative answer if additional hypotheses are made (Theorem 23). For example, the question is answered in the affirmative\nif the dimension of the ambient manifold does not exceed five.\nLet us now explain the technical calculations which result in Theorems 22 and 23.\n9.2. The co-ordinate system. Let n be a point of a Riemannian manifold (M, g) of\ndimension m + 1, and choose a unit vector e0 \u2208 Tn M . Consider the geodesic \u03b3 satisfying\n\u03b3(0) = n and \u03b3 \u2032 (0) = e0 . Our purpose is to determine the first few terms in the power\nseries expansion (in the variable r > 0) of the value (HII )(\u03b3(r)) which the mean curvature\nof the second fundamental form of the geodesic hypersphere Gn (r) of radius r and centre\nn assumes in the point \u03b3(r). In extension, the letter r will designate also the distance\nfunction with respect to the point n. It will be assumed throughout that r > 0 is\nsufficiently small, in order that everything below is well-defined.\nWe choose an orthonormal basis {e0 , . . . , em } of Tn M and consider the associated normal co-ordinate system x = (x0 , . . . , xm ) of (M , g) centered at n:\n!!\nm\nX\nj\nx exp\nt ej\n= (t0 , . . . , tm ) .\ns=0\n\nFor any fixed r, a co-ordinate system of Gn (r) is given by x = (x1 , . . . , xm ) in a Gn (r)neighbourhood of the point \u03b3(r) = exp(re0 ).\nIt should be noticed that the co-ordinate vector fields \u2202 j of M and \u2202j of Gn (r) are\nrelated by (j = 1, . . . , m)\nxj\n\u2202j = \u2202 j \u2212 0 \u2202 0 ,\nx\nand in particular there holds \u2202j = \u2202 j along \u03b3. (See also Figure 2.) Overlined tensor\nindices will refer to the co-ordinate system x, whereas ordinary tensor indices refer to the\nco-ordinate system x of the geodesic hyperspheres with centre n. The coefficients of the\nRiemannian curvature tensor of (M , g) are determined by (\u0131, u, v, e = 0, . . . , m)\nR\u0131 u v e = g(R(\u2202 \u0131 , \u2202 u )\u2202 v , \u2202 e ) .\nIn [8], the expansion of the mean curvature H of the geodesic hyperspheres was given\nat the point \u03b3(r):\nH (\u03b3(r)) =\n\n\u0001\n\u0001\nr\n1\nr2\n\u2212\nRic0 0 (n) \u2212\n\u22070 Ric0 0 (n)\nr 3m\n4m\n!\nm\n\u00012\n1 X\n1 2\nr3\nR0 a 0 e\n\u2212 \u22070 0 Ric0 0 \u2212\n+\nm\n10\n45 a e=0\n\n+ O(r 4 ) .\n(n)\n\n\f16\n\nSTEFAN HAESEN, STEVEN VERPOORT\n\n\u22021\n\u22020\n\n\u03b3(r)\n\n= \u22021 |\u03b3(r)\n\n\u03b3(r)\n\n\u22020\n\nh\u03be\nroug\nh\nt\nc\ndesi\ngeo\n\n(p)\n\nb\n\n\u03b3(r)\n\ngeodesi\nch\nyp\ners\nph\ner\n\n(r)\n\ne\n\nGn\n\nb\n\ne0\n\np\n\n\u03be\ne1\n\nb\n\n\u22021\n\n(p)\n\n\u22021 |(p)\n\nn\n\ng eo d\n0\nhe\nug\nhr o\n\u03b3t\nesic\n\nFigure 2.

A Riemannian manifold (of dimension m + 1) is locally flat if and only if\nthe mean curvature of the second fundamental form of every geodesic hypersphere is equal\nm\nto the constant 2r\n(where r is the radius of the geodesic hypersphere).\nm\nProof. Suppose that (M, g) is a Riemannian manifold for which the relation HII = 2r\nholds for every geodesic hypersphere. Then for any choice of n \u2208 M and e0 \u2208 Tn M , the\ncoefficients of the positive powers of r in formula (24) vanish.

Let (M, g) be a Riemannian manifold of dimension m + 1, and suppose\nthat the area of every geodesic hypersphere of M , as seen in the geometry of the second\nm\nfundamental form, is equal to r 2 \u03b1m (where r is the radius of the geodesic hypersphere,\nand \u03b1m is the area of the unit hypersphere of Em+1 ). Then there holds\n(\nS = 0;\n(26)\nkRk2 = kRick2 .\nFurther, M is locally flat if any of the following additional hypotheses is made:\n(i). dim M 6 5;\n(ii). the Ricci tensor of M is positive or negative semi-definite (in particular if M is\nEinstein);\n(iii). M is conformally flat and dim M 6= 6;\n(iv). M is a K\u00e4hler manifold of complex dimension 6 5;\n(v). M is a Bochner flat K\u00e4hler manifold of complex dimension 6= 6;\n(vi). M is a product of surfaces (with an arbitrary number of factors).\nProof. The first part of the theorem follows immediately from the given power series\nexpansion (25). Now assume (26) is satisfied.\n\n\fTHE MEAN CURVATURE OF THE SECOND FUNDAMENTAL FORM\n\n23\n\n(i) Suppose that M has dimension 6 5 (i.e., m 6 4). The trivial case m = 1 should\nbe excluded in the reasoning below. Let W denote the Weyl conformal curvature\ntensor of (M , g). There holds\n0 6 kWk2\n= kRk2 \u2212\n=\n\n4\n2\n2\nkRick2 +\nS\nm\u22121\nm(m \u2212 1)\n\nm\u22125\nkRk2 6 0 ,\nm\u22121\n\nand consequently, 0 = R.\n(ii) If \u01ebRic is positive semi-definite, for , for \u01eb = \u00b11, then 0 6 \u01ebtrRic = \u01ebS = 0 and\nconsequently Ric = 0 and R = 0.\n(iii) The case where dim M 6 5 has already been proved. So assume M is a conformally\nflat Riemannian manifold which satisfies (26), dim M > 7 (i.e. m > 6) and\n0 6= kRk. The fact that 0 = kWk2 implies\n(m \u2212 1)kRk2 = 4kRick2 = 4kRk2 < (m \u2212 1)kRk2 ,\nwhich is clearly a contradiction.\n(iv) and (v) can be proved similarly to the two previous cases by an analysis of the squared\nnorm of the Bochner curvature tensor. (vi) can be proved in the same way as in [14]. \u0003\nRemark 24. For a given r > 0 and n \u2208 M , the collection concentric geodesic hyperspheres {Gn (r + s)} can be seen as a variation of Gn (r) with variational vector field \u2212U.\nAn application of Theorem 4 gives that the relation\nZ\n\u2202\nAreaII (Gn (r)) =\nHII d\u03a9II\n\u2202r\nGn (r)\nholds. It can indeed be checked that the first terms in the power series expansion of both\nfunctions agree.\nAcknowledgements\nSome of the above results have been obtained with the help of useful comments made\nby B.-Y.
