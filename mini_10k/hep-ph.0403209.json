The latter effect allows\nin particular for smaller Dirac couplings.\n\n1 Introduction\nThermal leptogenesis [1] takes place through CP-violating decay of heavy neutrinos in the evolution of the early universe. It\neventually results in the baryon/antibaryon imbalance through partial conversion of leptons to baryons around the electroweak\nscale. From Sakharov's conditions [2], successful leptogenesis depends on both the amount of CP-violation and the importance\nof the departure from equilibrium.\nIn the simple model, i.e. the Standard Model (SM) together with three singlet heavy Majorana neutrinos, the description of\nthese phenomena can be accurately described by few parameters: light neutrino masses 1 and the lightest Majorana mass [3], [4],\n[5] (assuming an important hierarchy between Majorana states).\nThe inclusion of right-handed Majorana neutrinos is however quite difficult to justify outside some Grand Unification context\n(the most obvious candidate being SO(10)). Obviously, the unification is accompanied by gauge bosons coupled to Majorana\nneutrinos. Irrespective of the detailed breaking scheme, we can expect that the masses of some gauge bosons will be linked to\nthe breaking mechanism associated to the Majorana mass. As a consequence, a full description of leptogenesis should at the very\nleast consider the part of the gauge sector linked to right-handed neutrinos, that is particles as WR\u00b1 and a Z \u2032 .\nWhile we insist that the actual breaking scheme does not need to include an explicit passage through the stage SU(2)R \u00d7U(1),\nit is logical to include at least the above-mentioned particles in the analysis.\nThe inclusion of such particles can have non negligible impact on the analysis. The most straightforward is probably an extra\ndilution of the generated CP violation [6], and hence ultimately baryon number due to new decay and scattering channels. This\nwill be shown in some detail below. On the other hand, the new gauge couplings will also be seen to enhance leptogenesis in\nsome part of the parameter space, namely when the Yukawa couplings (Dirac masses) are small. In this case indeed, the presence\nof the larger gauge interactions favor the production of the heavy Majorana particles in a re-heating context.\nAs a result of both effects, we will thus find that the parameter area is both shrunk on one side, and extended to low Yukawa\ncoupling values.\nTo be definite, and despite the above remark that the present considerations apply very generally in unified theories, whether\nthe LR-symmetric stage is actually realized or not as an intermediary step of the symmetry breaking, we will use the simplest\nconsistent structure, namely SU(2)L \u00d7 SU(2)R \u00d7U(1)B\u2212L (note that the coupling constants of the two SU(2) groups need not be\nequal, but this translates only below in a re-definition of the gauge mass scale).\nAlso for definiteness, we assume that the SU(2)R \u00d7 U(1)B\u2212L is broken by a scalar triplet of SU(2)R; we have also assumed\nthat the mass of the surviving scalars are heavy enough for their effect to be neglected here (this scheme is opposite to the one\nconsidered in [7]). This scalar V EV as usual provides masses to WR\u00b1 and Z \u2032 gauge bosons and a Majorana mass for right-handed\nneutrinos N. The high Majorana mass leads to the \"see-saw\" mechanism [8] for the left-handed neutrino mass through the\nYukawa couplings:\n1\n(1)\nl \u0304L \u03c6 \u03bbl eR + l \u0304L \u03c6\u0303 \u03bb\u03bd N + N \u0304c MN + h.c.,\n2\n\u2217 ncosme@ulb.ac.be\n1 that\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\nis more precisely, the quantity m\u03031 = \u03bb\u03bd \u03bb\u03bd\u2020\nv2 /M1 for \u03bb\u03bd the left-handed neutrino Yukawa couplings matrix and M1 the lightest Majorana mass.\n11\n\n1\n\n\fwhere \u03c6 is the SM scalar doublet, and lL = \u03bdL\nAs, announced, the expected effects include:\n\neL\n\n\u0001T\n\n.\n\n1. The gauge dilution of the CP-asymmetry due to a CP-invariant decay rate through the gauge sector [6], this will be dealt\nwith in section 2.\n2. A lower Majorana decoupling due to new diffusion reactions beside the one usually considered in the minimal case cf.\nFig 1, 2. These additional diffusions keep heavy neutrinos at equilibrium in a wider parameter space, namely for small\nMajorana masses as seen below in section 4.\n3. In a re-heating scenario, the probability to produce the heavy neutrino can be considerably enhanced by their gauge\ncoupling with respect to the minimal case. This point is also discussed in section 4.\n\n2 CP-Asymmetry\nThe lepton asymmetry originates from the leptonic number violating and CP violating decay of Majorana neutrinos (N1 \u2192 lL \u03c6\n+ N1 \u2192 l \u0304L \u03c6 \u2020 ). The CP asymmetry in the decay is generated at the one loop level thanks to the complex nature of the neutrino\nmass matrix. In the minimal model of leptogenesis, this CP asymmetry for the lightest Majorana can be written as:\n\n\u03b51 =\n\n3\n\u0393(N1 \u2192 l \u03c6 ) \u2212 \u0393(N1 \u2192 l \u0304 \u03c6 \u2020 )\n1\n\u0010\n\u0011\n=\u2212\n16\u03c0 \u03bb \u03bb \u2020\n\u0393(N1 \u2192 l \u03c6 ) + \u0393(N1 \u2192 l \u0304 \u03c6 \u2020 )\n\u03bd\n\u03bd\n\n\u00012 i\nM1 h\nIm \u03bb\u03bd \u03bb\u03bd\u2020 1i ,\ni=2,3 Mi\n\n\u2211\n\n11\n\n(2)\n\nin the basis of diagonal Majorana mass matrix, with M1 \u226a M2 \u226a M3 .\nEven though \u03b51 depends on the flavor structure of the Yukawa couplings, and hence of the different unknown mass parameters,\nthe Davidson-Ibarra bound [9] gives:\n3 M1\n(m3 \u2212 m1 ) .\n(3)\n|\u03b51 | <\n16\u03c0 v2\nMoreover, an improvement has been recently proposed in [10], assuming the neutrino oscillation parameters \u2206m2solar << \u2206m2atm ,\nthat is:\ns\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0015 s\n\u0015\n(1 \u2212 a)m\u03031 2\n(m3 + m1 ) 2\n1\n3 M1\n2\u2212\n|\u03b51 | <\n(m\n\u2212\nm\n)\n,\n(4)\n1\n\u2212\n(1\n+\na)\n3\n1\n16\u03c0 v2\n2\n(m3 \u2212 m1 )\nm\u03031\nr\n\u00151/3\nh\ni1/3 \u0014\n(m21 +m23 +m\u030321 )3\nm1 m3\nwith a = 2Re m\u03032\n\u22121 \u2212 i\n\u2212\n1\n.\n27m2 m2 m\u03032\n1\n\n1 3 1\n\nThis bound provides an upper estimate of the CP asymmetry based on experimental constraints, and irrespective of the\nspecific mass pattern assumed in solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations.\nLet us turn to the decay channels for the Majorana neutrinos mediated by the extended gauge structure. Using the familiar\nnotation N1 for the lightest Majorana state, of mass M1 , two cases can be distinguished. When M1 > MWR , i.e. when the WR is\nlighter than all Majorana particles, the additional channels will mostly occur in a two body decay into an on-shell WR , and will\nbe found to dilute excessively the induced CP asymmetry. For M1 < MWR instead, the three-body decay channels will dominate.\nThese mostly CP conserving channels will result in a diluted CP asymmetry with respect to the minimal model, which we\nparametrise by X:\n\u03b51\n,\n(5)\n\u03b51tot =\n1+X\n \u0304 \u2020\nwhere the total decay width of the Majorana neutrino is \u0393tot\nN1 = [\u0393(N1 \u2192 l \u03c6 )+ \u0393(N1 \u2192 l \u03c6 )] (1 + X), with \u0393(N1 \u2192 l \u03c6 )+ \u0393(N1 \u2192\n\u0011\ni\nh\u0010\n/8\u03c0 M1 .\nl \u0304 \u03c6 \u2020 ) = \u03bb\u03bd \u03bb\u03bd\u2020\n11\nIn the first case, M1 > MWR , the two body decay width is:\n\u03932b\n1\n\ng2 M13\n=\n2\n32\u03c0 MW\nR\n\n1\u2212\n\n2\nMW\nR\n\nM12\n\n!2\n\n1+2\n\n2\nMW\nR\n\nM12\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(6)\n\n2 /M 2 the additional parameter which describes leptogenesis\nwhich therefore implies the following dilution factor (with aw = MW\n1\nR\nin the present case):\ng2 v2 (1 \u2212 aw)2 (1 + 2aw)\n.\n(7)\nX=\n4m\u03031 M1\naw\n\n2\n\n\fAs an estimate, taking for instance m\u03031 \u223c O(10\u22124 ) eV and M1 \u223c O(1011 ) GeV , which in the analysis of the minimal leptogenesis\nmodel seems to be in the allowed favored range of parameters to get a baryonic asymmetry of the order of nB /s \u223c O(10\u221210 );\nfor aw = 1/2, we get a dilution factor X \u223c O(104 \u2212 105 ). Since the dilution increases for lower aw , the dilution due to the\ntwo-body decay channel ruins completely the produced asymmetry and leads to a non acceptable leptogenesis scheme. We will\nnot consider here the case where the gauge boson is nearly degenerate with the Majorana particle.\nFor the second case, MWR > M1 , the decay width of the Majorana neutrino N1 in three bodies can be written as:\n\u03933b\n1 =\n\n3g4 M15\n.\n4\n210 \u03c0 3 MW\nR\n\n(8)\n\nThe corresponding dilution factor,\nX=\n\n3g4 v2\n1\n,\n2\n7\n2 \u03c0 m\u03031 M1 a2w\n\n(9)\n\ndecreases rapidly with the hierarchy and for m\u03031 \u223c O(10\u22124 ) eV and M1 \u223c O(1011 ) GeV with aw \u223c 10 we only get a dilution\n\u223c O(10).\nWe keep here the possibility of a successful leptogenesis and will therefore study the dynamical evolution in this case to\nreveal the characteristic features of this realistic frame, namely additional constraints, but also new windows for the re-heating\nscenario.\n\n3 Boltzmann equations with a minimal right-handed gauge sector\nIn this section, we consider the extension of the standard Boltzmann equations for leptogenesis to the minimal right-handed\ngauge sector presented in the introduction. In this model, the Majorana mass has the same origin than the breaking of the leftright structure through the expectation value of a scalar triplet of SU(2)R. As a consequence, interactions mediated by the gauge\nsector of right-handed fermions may be relevant with respect to the decoupling of Majorana neutrinos when decaying [11]. The\ninfluence of those processes on the leptogenesis efficiency depends on the relative hierarchy between the SU(2)R gauge boson\nmasses and the Majorana mass.\nWe assume here that the remaining components of the triplet scalar are heavy enough to be neglected in the evolution\nequations, and recall briefly the usual interactions of the scalar doublets in relation to the (m\u03031 , M1 ) parameters.\nThe decay through the scalar vertex (N1 \u2192 lL \u03c6 ) and \u2206L = 1 diffusions mediated by the scalar doublet \u03c6 (Fig. 1) are important\nin the Boltzmann equations with high m\u03031 . Indeed, we can easily see that (see appendix A for notations of the reduced quantities\nappearing in the Boltzmann equations):\n\u0001\n1\n(10)\n\u03b3D,\u03c6 , \u03b3\u03c6 ,s , \u03b3\u03c6 ,t \u221d m\u03031 ,\nH(M1 )s\nfor \u03b3D,\u03c6 = \u03b3 [(N1 \u2192 lL \u03c6 ) + (N1 \u2192 l \u0304L \u03c6 \u2020 )], \u03b3\u03c6 ,s = \u03b3 [(N1 lL \u2192 t \u0304R Q)] and \u03b3\u03c6 ,t = \u03b3 [(N1tR \u2192 l \u0304L Q\u0304)], the corresponding reaction densities.\nThey limit therefore the Majorana decoupling for growing Yukawa couplings and imply a reduction of the leptogenesis efficiency.\nFor \u2206L = 2 diffusions (Fig. 2), if we restrict ourselves to one Majorana neutrino in the propagator, we get:\n\n\u03b3N(, t)\n\u221d m\u030321 M1 ,\nH(M1 )s\n\n(11)\n\nfor \u03b3N = \u03b3 [(lL \u03c6 \u2192 l \u0304L \u03c6 \u2020 )] and \u03b3N, t = \u03b3 [(lL lL \u2192 \u03c6 \u03c6 \u2020 )]. Even though \u03b3N and \u03b3N, t increase with M1 in this case, the mediation\nthrough heavier Majorana neutrinos N2 and N3 strengthens this behavior. The exact evaluation of this effect is actually impossible\nsince it depends on the N2 and N3 masses together with their Yukawa couplings to light neutrinos. We adopt therefore the\nparametrisation of [3, 5, 10] to take this effect into account.\nIncidentally, since our goal is mainly to highlight the possible influence of interactions mediated by the SU(2)R gauge sector,\nwe neglect here scatterings with light SM gauge bosons as well as thermal effects and couplings renormalization which according\nto [5] give only O(1) corrections and less.\nWe turn now to the discussion of SU(2)R gauge bosons interactions. As already mentioned, since the case M1 > MWR\nis completely ruined by the gauge dilution of the CP asymmetry, we only consider here interactions for M1 < MWR . As a\nconsequence, the dominant interactions to be added here, are the WR and Z \u2032 - mediated scatterings.

This reaction however suffers of one more parameter, i.e. the Z \u2032 mass. We could deal with that problem by\nconsidering the two limit cases MZ \u2032 = MWR and MZ \u2032 \u2192 \u221e (shown in Fig. 5). The final leptonic asymmetry would then be in\nbetween these two cases. Nevertheless numerical computation shows only irrelevant differences between these cases in the\nfinal leptogenesis efficiency. We therefore present the only case MZ \u2032 = MWR . One should observe moreover that scattering\nmediated by the Z \u2032 boson can be neglected at energies far above the resonance. Actually, the WR -mediated process being\nin the t and u channels, its reduced cross-section ( \u03c3\u0302 \u223c s\u03c3 ) logarithmically grows with the center of mass energy while the\nZ \u2032 -mediated interaction, in the s channel, has a constant reduced cross section after the resonance.\nOn the other hand, even though Z \u2032 mediated processes have already been considered in [12], the inclusion here of charged\ncurrent interactions has a larger impact on the evolution of Majorana neutrinos since their corresponding rates are leading\nand less suppressed for decreasing temperature.\nAll these processes are independent of the Yukawa couplings but are more efficient for lower M1 :\n\u0001\n1\n1\n.\n\u03b3D, WR , \u03b3N1 , eR , \u03b3N1 , uR , \u03b3N1 , dR , \u03b3N1 , N1 \u221d\nH(M1 )s\nM1\n\n(13)\n\nThey do not influence the wash-out of the leptonic number and mostly act in preventing the departure from equilibrium of\nMajorana neutrinos.\nWe expect a decrease of the efficiency of leptogenesis at low M1 due to these effects, depending on the ratio aw , as can be\nexpected from (12) and (13).\n\n4\n\n\f\u03b3WR\n\n5\n0\n\nrag replacements\nlog 10\n\n\u0002\n\nPSfrag replacements\n\n\u0003\n\u03b3\nHn -5\n\n\u03b3\u03c6\n\n0\n\n\u03b3D, \u03c6 + \u03b3D, WR\n\u03b3\u03c6\nlog 10\n\n\u0002\n\n\u03b3\nHn\n\n-5\n\u0003\n\n\u03b3D, \u03c6 + \u03b3D, WR\n\n\u03b3WR\n\n-10\n\n\u03b3N1 , N1\n\n\u03b3D, \u03c6\n\n-10\n\n\u03b3N1 , N1\n\n-15\n\n-15\n-2\n\n-1\n\n1\n\n0\n\n-20\n-2\n\n2\n\n-1\n\nlog10 [z]\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\nlog10 [z]\n\nFigure 5: Examples of the competition between interactions rates in the minimal case and the gauge extended case.

From nucleosynthesis analysis and measurements on the cosmic microwave background, one can\ndeduce the very smallness of this asymmetry, i.e. according to the recent WMAP results [13]:\n\u0001 \u221210\nnB\n.\n= 6.1+0.3\n\u22120.2 10\nn\u03b3\n\n(16)\n\nIn order to explain this quantity through the leptogenesis process, once a lepton asymmetry is produced, we require the\nconvertion of this non-zero lepton number in a non-zero baryon number [14]. This convertion is provided by non-perturbative\nelectroweak interactions, as exemplified by sphalerons which take place around the electroweak phase transition and conserve\nB \u2212 L while violating both B and L. A complete conversion would lead to B f inal = \u22121/2Linitial but is usually evaluated to\nB f inal = \u221228/79Linitial [15].\nNow, in the most favorable case, the maximal lepton asymmetry produced by the Majorana neutrino decay can be estimated as\nf inal\nYL\n= \u03b51YNeq1 (init.), where YNeq1 (init.) is the initial equilibrium N1 abundance. However, the leptogenesis efficiency is not always\nmaximal and depends mainly on the importance of the departure from equilibrium and the possible wash-out of the produced\nlepton asymmetry by \u2206L 6= 0 diffusions. We can easily write an analytical expression for the efficiency using the integral form\nof the Boltzmann equation for the lepton number:\n\n\u03b7e f f =\n\nZ \u221e\n0\n\ndt\n\nz(YN1 \u2212 YNeq1 )\n\nsH(M1 )YNeq1 (init.)2\n\n\u03b3D, \u03c6\n\n\u0014 Z\nExp \u2212\n\nt\n\n\u221e\n\n\u0015\ndx WL (x) ,\n\n(17)\n\n2 We do not consider here an evolution equation for the leptonic number of right-handed fermions since we assume no CP asymmetry in that sector, which is\ntreated here at tree level.\n\n5\n\n\ffor WL (z) =\n\nz\neq\nsH(M1 )YN\n1\n\n\u0010\n\n\u03b3D, \u03c6\n2\n\n\u0011\n+ 2\u03b3N + 2\u03b3N, t + 2\u03b3\u03c6 , t + YYN1\neq \u03b3\u03c6 , s the wash-out terms of the leptonic asymmetry. The efficiency does\nN1\n\nnot depend on the CP asymmetry and characterizes therefore the intrinsic dynamics of the leptogenesis process in a given theory.\nAs a consequence, depending on the parameters, we can express the final leptonic asymmetry including the efficiency by:\nf inal\n\nnL\ns\n\nf inal\n\n= YL\n\n= \u03b51YN1 (init.)\u03b7e f f .\neq\n\n(18)\n\nFinally, the baryons to photons ratio is evaluated in term of leptogenesis quantities to :\n28\nnB\n196\n\u2243 7 YB\u2212L = \u2212\n\u03b51YNeq1 (init.)\u03b7e f f ,\nn\u03b3\n79\n79\n\n(19)\n\nwhere the factor 7 holds for s/n\u03b3 .\nWe present results for the leptogenesis efficiency \u03b7e f f as a function of m\u03031 , M1 and aw the WR to Majorana mass squared ratio\nin Figure 6.\nBoth thermal and zero initial Majorana abundance scenarios are shown but, however, with respect to the minimal leptogenesis\nscheme which is significantly more constrained by a zero initial Majorana abundance, the extended gauge model shows less\ndependency according to these cases even for a sizable hierarchy. Indeed, as one can easily expect, the creation of heavy\nMajorana neutrinos is not anymore a problem once they are allowed to take part in gauge interactions. This effect remains up to\nratios of the order aw \u221d 106 in the relevant M1 range.\nThe second interresting consequence of the inclusion of WR mediated diffusions is a drastic reduction of leptogenesis efficiency for low Majorana masses which increases dramatically for low aw -ratio. This comes from both delayed (or impeded)\ndecoupling of Majorana neutrinos through additional diffusions and decay channels: the final leptonic asymmetry is therefore\nreduced.\nNow, in order to discuss the baryon number, we have to link observables on neutrino oscillations and the CP asymmetry in the\ndecay of the lightest Majorana\n(4). As already proposed by [5] and for the purpose of comparison, we consider the sample case\np\n2\nwhere m3 = max(m\u03031 , \u2206matm ) with m23 \u2212 m21 = \u2206m2atm . Combining equations (4) and (19) therefore provides an upper estimate\nof the baryons to photons ratio.\nFigure 7 shows the iso-nb /n\u03b3 curves in the (m\u03031 , M1 ) plane obtained for different aw -ratios, assuming the central value of\nbaryon asymmetry obtained from WMAP (16). Successful leptogenesis occurs in the region bounded by the curves.\nWe can then extract a lower limit on the Majorana mass according to the WR to Majorana mass squared ratio:\n2 /M 2\naw = MW\n1\nR\n104\n102\n10\n2\n\nM1 > (GeV)\n\u223c 109\n\u223c 1010\n\u223c 1011\n\u223c 1012\n\nAs already mentioned above, the case with zero initial Majorana abundance scenario (after assumed re-heating) is almost indistinguishable in our framework from the case of a thermal initial abundance. Consequently, in the case of re-heating, we allow,\ndespite the dilution, for broader windows in some domains of the parameters .\nFor comparison, the minimal (non-gauged Majorana) model curve for an initial thermal Majorana abundance co\u0131\u0308ncides in\npractice with our curve for aw = 106 (the latter, irrespective of the thermal or re-heating scenario).\n\n5 Conclusion\nInspired by a grand-unified framework necessary to understand the presence of heavy Majorana particles, we considered the\naddition of a minimal gauge sector for right-handed neutrinos and derived its consequences on baryon number in both the\nthermal decay and re-heating scenarios.\nThe results are :\n\u2022 a diluted CP asymmetry due to new Majorana decay channels through gauge bosons, restricting successful leptogenesis to\nthe case MWR > M1 [6];\n\u2022 a reduction of the leptogenesis efficiency for low WR to Majorana mass squared ratio ( for aw < 104);\n\u2022 in the re-heating scenario, an enhanced production of Majorana neutrinos thanks to their gauge interactions ( up to aw \u223c\n106).\n6\n\n\fThe consequences from the baryon to photon ratio on the neutrino mass parameters with respect to the minimal scheme is\na higher Majorana mass for decreasing WR to Majorana mass ratio and a broader window in the case of zero initial Majorana\nabundance (see Figure 7).\n\nAcknowledgments\nI would like to thank especially J.-M.
