Evidence of a bright core with a slightly extended\nstructure was found on milliarcsecond resolution observations with the VLBA at 15.4\nGHz. Later observations with the VLBA (and including the phased up VLA) at 8.4\nGHz show an extended jet-like feature extending to \u223c 15 mas from a core region, with\nan opening angle of < 2\u25e6 . In addition, lower resolution MERLIN observations at 5\nGHz show that the source has < 10 per cent linear polarization. The source was in the\nlow/hard X-ray state during the observations, and the results confirm the existence of\npersistent radio emission from an unresolved core and a variable relativistic (> 0.6 c)\njet during this state.\nKey words: binaries: close - stars: individual: Cygnus X-1 - ISM: jets and outflows.\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nOf the \u223c250 currently known X-ray binaries, approximately\n50 have detectable radio emission and a dozen or so of these\nhave been found to have radio jets. Extreme examples of\nthe jet sources are GRS 1915+105 (Mirabel & Rodriguez\n1994; Fender et al. 1999) and GRO J1655\u201340 (Hjellming &\nRupen 1995; Tingay et al. 1995), both exhibiting apparent\nsuperluminal motion. Such jet sources often show strong radio flux variability (see Fender, Burnell & Waltman 1997\nfor a review). However, some sources show relatively little\nvariation, such as Cygnus X-1 and LS 5039. The persistently\nradio-emitting (20\u201340 mJy) LS 5039, which is at a similar\ndistance, has been shown to have a milliarcsecond-scale jet\n(Parades et al. 2000).\nCygnus X-1 (HDE 226868, V1357 Cygni) comprises a\nsupergiant secondary (spectral type O9.7 Iab) with mass between 20\u201333 M\u2299 , together with a compact primary which is\na strong black-hole candidate with mass between 7\u201316 M\u2299 .\nThe orbital period has been detected in optical, UV, X-ray\nand radio wavelengths (Pooley, Fender & Brocksopp 1999;\nBrocksopp et al. 1999b). The orbital period is \u223c5.6 days orbital radius of 0.2 AU is derived; at an assumed distance of\n2 kpc (Gierli\u0144ski et al. 1999) this corresponds to an angular\nc 1994 RAS\n\nscale of 0.1 milliarcsecond (mas). An orbital ephemeris has\nbeen derived from optical radial velocity data (LaSala et al.\n1998) and compared with other wavelength data (Brocksopp\net al. 1999b).\nThe source has been fairly stable in the low/hard Xray state, at around 15 mJy at cm wavelengths and with\nan extremely flat radio spectrum. The radio emission was\nfirst observed following a 'turn on' corresponding to a Xray state change in 1972. The 'turn on' was probably the\nrecovery from a high/soft state during which time the jet\nhad been quenched as Zhang et al. (1997) show that the\nradio emission was similarly suppressed during the high/soft\nX-ray state in 1996. This is behaviour similar to that shown\nby GX 339\u20134 during 1998 (Fender et al. 1999b).\nAt 15 GHz, a quasi-sinusoidal 3 mJy semi-amplitude\nmodulation is observed superimposed on the 14 mJy mean\nlevel. The minimum occurs at superior conjunction of the\ncompact body, implying that the radio-emitting region is\nassociated with this compact object (Pooley et al. 1999).\nMore recently a further modulation period of 142 days has\nbeen detected (Brocksopp et al. 1999b), explained as precession or warping of the disk. The source displays a flat\nspectrum between 2 and 220 GHz, with an average spectral\n\n\fA. M. Stirling et al.\n\n2\n\nlongest transatlantic baselines (Lestrade, priv. comm.) suggesting resolved source structure on the milliarcsecond scale.\nTo investigate the milliarcsecond source structure in more\ndetail, we obtained full track, 15.4 GHz Very Long Baseline\nArray (VLBA) observations of the source in 1997. These\nwere subsequently followed up in 1998 with multi-epoch and\nmulti-frequency 8.4 and 15.4 GHz observations. The initial\n15.4 GHz observations and the later 8.4 GHz multi-epoch\nobservations are discussed in this paper. The multi-epoch\n15.4 GHz observations will be presented in a separate paper\n(de La Force et al. in prep). In this paper we also present the\nresults of an analysis of archive MERLIN data, investigating\nthe linear polarization properties of Cygnus X-1.\n\n-81\n\n-82\n\nMilliARC SEC\n\n-83\n\n-84\n\n-85\n\n2.1\n-86\n\n-87\n-43\n\n-44\n\n-45\n\n-46\nMilliARC SEC\n\n-47\n\n-48\n\n-49\n\nFigure 1. The naturally weighted VLBA image of Cygnus X-1\nfrom 1997 March 28, at 15.4 GHz has a lowest contour of 0.4 mJy\nbeam\u22121 and a peak flux density of 5.0 mJy beam\u22121 . As with all\nimages in this paper the contouring represents factors of two.\n\nindex |\u03b1| \u2264 0.15 (Fender et al. 2000). A small radio flare coincident with an X-ray flare in 1975 further demonstrated an\nX-ray/radio correlation (Hjellming & Han 1995). Both the\nobserved flat spectrum and the orbital modulation fit into\nthe slowed adiabatically expanding conical radio jet model\n(Hjellming & Johnston 1988). It is not clear how common\nthe small flares (less than \u223c30 mJy) are or exactly how the\nX-ray state changes affect the radio emission (Brocksopp et\nal. 1999b).\nAn accretion disk is essential in models of the X-ray\nvariability. The source has high/soft, low/hard and intermediate spectral states, spending most time in the low/hard\nX-ray state. The X-ray state changes can be modelled using a variable accretion rate; when the accretion rate is low\nan advection dominated accretion flow (ADAF) is postulated (Esin et al. 1998), giving a low radiative efficiency, as\nexpected for such underluminous quiescent sources. The existence of a jet perpendicular to the disk implies that the\noutflow process may be important in terms of mass and angular momentum loss from the disk.\nPrevious radio maps on both Very Large Array (VLA)\n(Marti et al. 1996) and MERLIN (Newell 1997) size scales (5\narcsecond and 50 mas beam FWHM respectively) showed no\nconclusive evidence for resolved or extended emission. The\nVLA image showed emission regions to the north and south\nwhich could be lobes associated with the source at an extent\nof \u223c5 arcminutes.\n\n2\n\nVLBI AND MERLIN OBSERVATIONS\n\nFor over a decade Cygnus X-1 has been employed as an\nastrometric reference source (Lestrade et al. 1995). Variations in the visibility amplitude were observed on the very\n\nInitial 15.4 GHz VLBA observations\n\nOn 1997 March 28 the VLBA interferometer network was\nused to observe a single epoch of Cygnus X-1 at 15.4 GHz\nwhile the source was in the low/hard X-ray state. The run\nwas made at 10:15 \u2013 19:45 UT (centred on Julian date\n2450901.06), recording at a sustained rate of 128 Mbits per\nsecond. Only one hand of polarization was recorded in Lefthand Circular Polarization (LCP) providing a total bandwidth of 64 MHz. The observations were made in phasereference mode with a typical cycle time of 2.0 minutes on\nthe phase-calibrator and 2.0 minutes on the target, Cygnus\nX-1. The phase-calibrator used throughout these observations was B1955+335, a bright (S15GHz \u223c300 mJy), compact radio source (with an accurately measured astrometric ICRF position) lying within 1.1 degrees of Cygnus X-1.\nThe data were correlated at the NRAO correlator in Socorro, NM, USA. The coordinates chosen to correlate the\ndata were those given by the most recent published radio\nposition, 19h 58m 21.s 680 +35\u25e6 12\u2032 05.\u2032\u2032 887 (epoch 1986, J2000)\nLestrade et al. (1995). With a total of 8 hours observing time\nexcellent uv-coverage of the target source was obtained.\nThe initial analysis of the data was performed with the\nNRAO AIPS package (e.g. Fomalont 1981). The visibility\namplitudes were calibrated using the system temperatures\nand gain information provided by each of the telescopes.\nOccasional observations of 3C345 were used to align the individual 8 MHz sub-bands (IFs) that spanned the total 64\nMHz bandwidth. The antenna residual delays, fringe rates\nand gain corrections were determined from the phase calibrator and interpolated and applied to the target, Cygnus\nX-1.\nUnfortunately, the positions we supplied to the correlator did not take into account the proper motion of Cygnus\nX-1. Thus our first map made from the calibrated Cygnus X1 data showed no radio emission in the centre of the map but\nobvious side-lobe structure from a source apparently located\noutside the field was clearly visible. A wide field image of the\nregion (for which no averaging of the data were performed)\nrevealed this source to be Cygnus X-1, offset 46 mas to the\neast and 84 mas to the south of the nominal phase-centre.\nOur position, after correcting for the measured proper motion of the source (provided by Lestrade, priv. comm.) is\nwithin 1.5 mas of the original astrometric position (Lestrade\net al. 1995). The refined proper motion is 8.7 \u00b1 0.2 mas yr\u22121\nin position angle (PA) -151 \u00b1 1\u25e6 .\nThe Cygnus X-1 data were Fourier transformed and\nthen CLEANed using the AIPS task IMAGR which allows\nc 1994 RAS, MNRAS 000, ??\u2013??\n\n\fA relativistic jet from Cygnus X-1 in the low/hard X-ray state\nvariable data weighting using the robust parameter (Briggs\n1995). No self-calibration of the data was performed. A naturally weighted (robust 5) image is presented in Figure 1.\nThe elliptical Gaussian restoring beam measures 1.13 \u00d7 0.63\nmas in PA 12.9\u25e6 .\nThe source is clearly detected, and is plotted relative\nto the epoch 1986 coordinates chosen for correlation. The\nstructure is confused and ambiguous, this is likely due to\nerrors in the phase referencing process. Unfortunately the\nsource was too weak for reliable self-calibration with this\nobserving array. An attempt to model fit these data as a single component with DIFMAP (Pearson et al. 1994) suggested\nan extension in PA \u221215\u25e6 \u00b1 5 (Stirling, Spencer & Garrett\n1998). It seems likely that the radio emission represents an\nunresolved radio-jet.\n2.2\n2.2.1\n\nFollow up VLBA multi-epoch 8.4 GHz\nobservations\nObservations and data reduction\n\nFurther high resolution observations of Cygnus X-1 were\nmade in August 1998 with the VLBA and VLA. Three\nepochs of observations were obtained every 2 days to cover a\nlarge fraction of the period (5.6 days) of the binary system.\nThe runs were made at 04:19 \u2013 08:55 UT on the 10th, (epoch\nA) at 04:20 \u2013 08:30 UT on the 12th (epoch B) and at 04:20\n\u2013 08:30 UT on the 14th (epoch C). The mid point of each\nobservation was on Julian date 2451035.76 (A), 2451037.76\n(B) and 2451039.76 (C). Observations were made at 15.4\nand 8.4 GHz, the frequencies being alternated each hour.\nOnly the 8.4 GHz data are considered in this paper.\nSince the source is relatively weak, the phased VLA was\nalso included as one element in the array. A data rate of 256\nMbits per second was used (recording LCP in 8 \u00d7 8 MHz\nsub-bands, 2-bit sampled at the Nyquist rate). The Cygnus\nX-1 data were correlated using a position of 19h 58m 21.s 67634\n+35\u25e6 12\u2032 05.\u2032\u2032 7940, J2000 (derived from our earlier 15.4 GHz\nobservations but with the source proper motion now included). The data analysis followed the standard procedure\ndescribed earlier in Section 2.1.\n2.2.2\n\nImages and component fluxes\n\nDue to thunder storms and bad weather at the VLA the\nthird epoch had generally noisier data on the most sensitive\nVLA\u2013VLBA baselines. The three naturally weighted images\nat 8.4 GHz have been self-calibrated in AIPS (using the extremely sensitive 'phased' VLA as a reference antenna) and\nare presented in Figure 2 with identical contouring. Here the\nradio emission from a jet to the north-west is much clearer,\nextending out to \u223c15 mas from the core. The unresolved\ncore likely represents the base of the visible jet and its flux\ndensity variations with orbital phase are given in Table 1.\nThere is some correlation between orbital ephemeris\n(from Brocksopp et al. 1999a) and the flux densities measured from our maps, as the unresolved core flux density has\na maximum around inferior conjunction (see Table 1) and\nthe orbital phase modulation of the radio flux does indeed\nimply the radio flux variation should originate in or near the\ncore, as observed. The flare preceding our observations by\naround 15 days as shown in Brocksopp et al. (1999b) may\nc 1994 RAS, MNRAS 000, ??\u2013??\n\n3\n\ncomplicate the integrated flux density and period relationship found by Pooley et al. (1999).\n2.3\n\nMERLIN archival data\n\nAs all of the VLBA observations were made using a single\nhand of polarization, it was impossible to examine the linear\npolarization emitted from the jet. As MERLIN observes in\nall four polarization correlations as standard, linearly polarized emission can be imaged. Only the total intensity (Stokes\nI) image was presented by Newell (1997).\nThese MERLIN data, observed on 1995 July 19 were\nretrieved from the archives and calibrated in full polarization using the MERLIN pipeline (Thomasson et al. 1993).\nThe 5 GHz observations were made in the standard MERLIN continuum setup over a bandwidth of 16 MHz. Also\nobserved were a phase reference source, 1951+355; a flux\nand polarization PA calibrator, 3C286; and a point source\ncalibrator, OQ208. The total intensity map of Cygnus X-1\nwas convolved with a Gaussian beam of 58 \u00d7 37 mas in PA\n\u201381.2\u25e6 and found to be a point source with a peak flux density of 11.9 \u00b1 0.6 mJy beam\u22121 in agreement with Newell\n(1997). No linear polarization was detected associated with\nthe source to an upper limit of 0.9 mJy beam\u22121 , ruling out\na simple, very ordered field structure.\n\n3\n3.1\n\nANALYSIS OF THESE AUGUST 1998 DATA\nEmission mechanism\n\nWe can place a lower limit on the brightness temperature of\nthe unresolved radio emission simply by using the RayleighJeans approximation. Using a flux density of 6 mJy and a\nsolid angle equivalent to the uniform beam (epoch B) we derive a minimum temperature of 107 K at 8.4 GHz, inferring\nthat the radiation is non-thermal, and is not for example due\nto free-free emission from gas at 104 K. The observed spectral index and the detection of polarization in a number of\njet sources suggests that the radiation is via the synchrotron\nmechanism. A spectral break is not observed in the radio or\nmm regimes, implying that the emitting electrons do not\nsuffer significant radiative losses (Fender et al. 2000). The\nflat spectral index supports the non-thermal interpretation,\nand is often attributed to multiple expanding synchrotronemitting regions within the beam when observed in the jets\nfrom quasars.\n3.2\n\nDoppler boosting\n\nFollowing the method of Mirabel & Rodriguez (1994), under\nthe assumption of an intrinsically symmetric ejection, then\nfor bulk motions at a jet velocity \u03b2 the observed ratio of\nthe approaching jet components flux density, Sapp , to the\nreceding jet components flux density, Srec , (assuming optically thin components or non-overlapping optically thick\ncomponents) is given by\nSapp\n=\nSrec\n\n\u0012\n\n1 + \u03b2 cos i\n1 \u2212 \u03b2 cos i\n\n\u0013k\u2212\u03b1\n\n,\n\n(1)\n\nwith S\u03bd \u221d \u03bd +\u03b1 ; k = 2 for a continuous jet and k = 3 for\n\n\fA.

Image properties for Cygnus X-1 at 8.4 GHz in August, 1998. Flux calibration is typically accurate to 5 per cent for VLBA\nimages at this frequency. The unresolved flux densities per beam were derived from the uniformly weighted (robust -5) images, which\nare not presented in this paper.\n\ndiscrete plasmons; i is the angle to the line-of-sight. If the\nsource is optically thick in places then the full radiation\ntransfer equation must be solved, and then Equation 1 gives\nonly an approximation to \u03b2 (Lind & Blandford 1985), see\ne.g. Cawthorne (1991) for a derivation of the (rather small)\ncorrection factors for a partially optically thick and continuous jet.\nAs we cannot measure the motion of individual components in both the receding and approaching jets we cannot\ndirectly derive both \u03b2 and i and hence the index k \u2212 \u03b1.\nHowever we note that the average accretion disk axis, i,\n(and hence the jet) is likely to be around 40\u25e6 to the line-ofsight (Bruevich et al. 1978) although this is not well defined\n(Brocksopp et al. 1999b). We use the angle to the line-ofsight to derive \u03b2 for various values of k \u2212 \u03b1.\nWe assume that we see only one side of the jet in our\nepoch A and use a ratio of approaching and receding flux\ndensities of 50 to derive lower limits to the jet speed. The\nratio is derived by assuming the receding jet flux is \u2264 6\nbeams \u00d7 r.m.s noise per beam, with 6 beams the extent of\n\nthe approaching jet. Although the unresolved flux monitoring suggests a spectral index of around 0, using \u20130.6 gives a\nlower limit to \u03b2 (it is unlikely that a synchrotron spectrum\nis much steeper than \u20130.6). We derive \u03b2 for spectral indices of 0 and \u20130.6 and for both the continuous and discrete\ncases (Table 2). Errors from the poorly constrained angle to\nthe line-of-sight dominate these calculations and the results\nshould be regarded as order-of-magnitude only, especially as\nany possible attenuation of radiation from the receding jet\nby external free-free absorption cannot be quantified with a\nsingle frequency. The derived lower limits to \u03b2 suggest the\njet is at least moderately relativistic > 0.6 c.\nThe longer timescale precessional period (142 days) of\nCygnus X-1, where the deviation of the plane of the disk\nfrom the orbital plane, \u03b4, may reach as much as \u223c37\u25e6 (Brocksopp et al. 1999b) is a further uncertainty. Soft X-ray monitoring (Brocksopp et al. 1999b) suggests that the soft X-ray\nintensity is mid-way between extrema during our observations; therefore the disk is close to its average inclination.\nThe emitted synchrotron intensity of the jet scales with\nc 1994 RAS, MNRAS 000, ??\u2013??\n\n\fA relativistic jet from Cygnus X-1 in the low/hard X-ray state\n\n5\n\na timescale for changes in the accretion rate, as is likely in\nGX 339\u20134 (Corbel et al. 2000). The extended emission on\nVLA scales (Marti et al. 1996) may be consistent with our\nmeasured jet position angle, particularly if the several mas\nper year south-west proper motion is considered.\n\n25\n\n20\n\n3.3\n\nMilliARC SEC\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n-5\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n-4\n-6\nMilliARC SEC\n\n-8\n\n-10\n\n-12\n\n-14\n\nFigure 3.

For \u03b2 of 0.75 and i = 40\u25e6 we find D = 1.55. Using\nthe observed long term variations in total flux of \u2264 3 mJy\ngives a maximum value for \u03b4 (assuming, say, \u03b1 = 0 for the\nradio jet) of only 4\u25e6 . Therefore either the jet velocity is nonrelativistic (and hence D \u223c 1) or the actual precession of the\njet is small compared to that suggested for the soft X-ray\nemitting region of the disk. Given our lower limits to \u03b2 (in\nTable 2) we suggest that the inner part of the disk may be\nprecessing at significantly less than the angle of around \u223c37\u25e6\nsuggested by soft X-ray monitoring. One solution to this\nwould be a twisted accretion disk as postulated for SS433\n(Sharp et al. 1984). Alternatively the \u223c142 day 'period' is\nc 1994 RAS, MNRAS 000, ??\u2013??\n\nA continuous and bending jet?\n\nThe higher resolution (robust 0 or partial uniform weighting) image in Figure 3 was made using epoch A, the best set\nof 8.4 GHz data. Even with a resolving beam significantly\nsmaller than that provided by natural weighting the jet still\nappears continuous in Figure 3, although with small variations along it and a general decrease in brightness along the\njet. Even at this resolution we may find that we are not resolving multiple discrete components (as was not discovered\nin SS433 until detailed VLBI observations were made).\nEpoch A shows a pronounced bend or kink at around\n7 mas from the radio core. The jet region at 8\u201315 mas subtends a similar position angle from the core (21\u201324\u25e6 ) in all\n3 epochs, whereas the inner jet (< 7 mas) is at 17\u25e6 during\nepoch A. The apparent change in direction of the jet suggests that the position angle of ejection is varying, perhaps\neither jet precession or jitter, both of which are observed in\nSS433 (Margon & Anderson 1989). It is also possible that the\nkinks observed in the extended emission are consistent with\na bending jet flow, rather than a ballistic motion, although\napparently unrelated to the direction of the proper motion\nof Cygnus X-1 as would be expected from ram pressure considerations. Projection effects will enhance the appearance\nof a jet bend (as with apparent 90\u25e6 bends in blazar jets).\nThe higher resolution image in Figure 3 shows that the bend\noccurs in a minimum of surface brightness. This is consistent with an underlying helical magnetic field in which the\nmagnetic field pitch angle reverses sign at the bend in radio structure e.g. Laing (1981); Papageorgiou (priv. comm.).\nMeasurements of any linear polarization could confirm this\nmodel.\nThe bend is no longer apparent in epochs B and C,\nsuggesting that the feature disappears on a timescale of \u2264\n2 days. This could be due to rapid motion and decay via\nadiabatic expansion, or by synchrotron losses. In the latter\ncase the magnetic field in the component would need to be\ngreater than 16 G, rather higher than is commonly deduced\nfor microquasar jets.\nIt is also apparent in Figure 3 that the jet is not resolved\nperpendicular to the flow. Using a beam size of 1 mas across\nthe jet and a maximum distance from the core of 15 mas on\nthe plane of the sky, the opening semi-angle of the radioemitting material is constrained to \u22642\u25e6 .\nThe flat radio spectrum in Cygnus X-1 specifically\nhas been modelled as slowed expansion in a continuous jet\n(Hjellming & Johnston 1988). The predicted spectrum for\nthis geometry is flat until a turnover at around 10 GHz for\nan inclination of 40\u25e6 . However the self-absorption in a slowed\nexpanding jet model cannot explain the observed flat spectrum to mm wavelengths (Fender et al. 2000). In comparison\njet components from GRS 1915+105 are observed to become\noptically thin less than a few minutes after ejection at mm\nwavelengths (Mirabel et al. 1998). Possibly another inverted\nspectrum component (such as the disk or stellar wind) as\nwell as the partially-self-absorbed conical jet is required to\n\n\f6\n\nA. M. Stirling et al.\n\nexplain the wavelength dependence up to mm wavelengths\nof the integrated spectrum.\n\n4\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nCygnus X-1 has been detected with the VLBA at 15.4 GHz,\ngiving a 13 year timebase for proper motion measurements.\nSubsequent imaging at 8.4 GHz shows that a relativistic jet\nwith either a bending flow or a variable ejection angle exists\nin Cygnus X-1. The jet appears to be narrow (< 2\u25e6 opening\nangle). The source was known to be in a low/hard X-ray\nstate at the times of all our observations. Given the documented X-ray/radio correlations, and our three separate\nimages of extended radio emission, it is likely that a jet always exists in the 'quiescent' low/hard X-ray state thought\nto harbour a central ADAF. It is unclear how the low-level\nradio flaring of the low/hard X-ray state fits into the picture\nof a steady-state accretion disk input/output system.\nFurther VLBI observations with a global VLBI array\nwere undertaken in May 2001. A sequence of images within\na day should show if the radio jet is continuous or consists\nof moving discrete components.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe wish to thank Guy Pooley for flux monitoring efforts\nand J-F Lestrade for providing accurate proper motion data.\nDiscussion with Tim Cawthorne, Denise Gabuzda and Zsolt\nParagi improved the scope of this paper significantly.
