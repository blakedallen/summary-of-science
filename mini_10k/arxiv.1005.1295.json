These studies represent a\nsignificant step forward in our ability to predict how the structural and mechanical properties of\ncompact polymers depend on collapse dynamics.\nPACS numbers: 61.46.Bc,64.70.km,82.70.Dd,64.60.Cn\n\nOver the past several decades significant research activity has focused on understanding dense packings of\nhard spheres, since they serve as model systems for\natomic and colloidal liquids and glasses, jammed granular media, and compressed foams and emulsions. An intriguing property of hard-sphere systems is that they can\nbe prepared in crystalline, partially ordered, and amorphous packings [1]. Packings of 'sticky' hard spheres with\ncontact attractions have been used to investigate selfassembly of colloidal particles with depletion attractions.\nArkus et al. recently combined graph theory and geometrical techniques [2, 3] to enumerate minimal energy\npackings (MEPs), i.e. those with the maximum number\nof contacts, for N \u2264 10 sticky hard spheres. Their predictions agreed with experiments on attractive colloids [4].\nHowever, there have been few studies of packings of\nsticky tangent hard-sphere polymers, which can model\npolymer collapse, protein folding, and protein interactions [5]. Recent simulations [6, 7] and experiments\n[8] have investigated polymer packings; however, they\nconsidered non-sticky spheres with only hard-core repulsions, where free volume, not energy, is relevant. Thus,\nthere is little understanding of how covalent bond and\nchain uncrossability constraints affect structural and mechanical properties of sticky hard-sphere polymer packings and the probabilities with which these occur.\nIn this Letter, we perform exact enumeration studies\nof MEPs for sticky, tangent, monodisperse hard-sphere\npolymers (both linear and cyclic) and contrast the results with those for sticky hard spheres without polymer\nconstraints. Our studies begin to address several overarching questions: 1) How do the probabilities for obtaining\npolymer MEPs differ from those for sticky hard-sphere\nMEPs? and 2) How do the properties of single compact\npolymers depend on collapse dynamics, e.g. do they collapse into crystalline or amorphous clusters?\n\nOur results show that polymer constraints reduce\nthe ways in which hard spheres can be arranged into\nMEPs, and the strength of this effect varies for different macrostates (i.e. structurally distinct packings). We\ndemonstrate that the large reduction in the number of\narrangements may be understood in terms of dividing\nsurfaces. These split polymer packings into disjoint regions and eliminate particle-label permutations that do\nnot correspond to polymer chains. We find that polymer\nMEPs with intermediate structural symmetry are more\nfrequent relative to the monomer case, where entropy favors low symmetry MEPs [4].\nIn addition, using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of temperature quenches at various rates \u1e6a , we show\nthat single chains display glassy dynamics during collapse, and that the final polymer packings depend on \u1e6a .\nIn the slow quench rate limit, the chains undergo a sharp\n[9] transition to crystallites, with a jump in the energy\nand number of contacts Nc (including covalent bonds) at\ntemperature T = Tmelt . The crystallites possess a closepacked core surrounded by a \"surface\" whose size and\ndisorder increase with |\u1e6a |. For slow quenches, Nc at Tmelt\njumps from below the minimal number Ncmin = 3N \u2212 6\nrequired for mechanical stability [10] to Ncslow , where a\nsignificant fraction of the monomers possess 12 contacts.\nIn the large |\u1e6a | limit, the clusters are disordered with\n< N min contacts even as T \u2192 0, showing that rigidifica\u223c c\ntion can hinder crystallization.\nWe first describe exact enumeration methods for\nmonomer and polymer MEPs [20]. To generate possible packings for a given number of spheres N and contact\nnumber Nc , we\nP iterate over all N \u00d7 N adjacency matrices\n\u0100 satisfying j>i Aij = Nc . The elements of \u0100 are 1 for\ncontacting particles, and 0 for non-contacting particles\nand diagonal entries.

Values for f and \u03a9 do not account for chiral twins [2].

The distinction between permanent covalent\nand thermally fluctuating noncovalent bonds is not important for static packings; we include both types in Nc .\nWe enumerate all adjacency matrices satisfying the\nabove conditions and then identify those that also fulfill hard-sphere and minimal rigidity constraints. Hardsphere constraints imply that the center-to-center distances rij between unit spheres i and j obey rij \u2265 1,\nwhere the equality holds for contacting pairs. Necessary\nconditions for rigidity are that each monomer possesses\nat least three contacts and Nc \u2265 Ncmin [13].\nTo enforce these constraints, we implemented geometrical rules developed by Arkus et al. [2, 3] that eliminate\ninvalid adjacency matrices. For the remaining configurations, we solved the system of quadratic equations\n|~ri \u2212 ~rj |2 = d2ij\n\n(1)\n\nfor sphere positions ~ri to an accuracy of 10\u22129 . We also\ncalculated the dynamical matrix (all second derivatives of\nthe energy in Eq. (2) with respect to monomer displacements) for all configurations, which allowed us to identify\nrigid (with 3N \u2212 6 nonzero eigenvalues) and floppy configurations [13] (with fewer nonzero eigenvalues) [20].\nFrom this procedure, we obtain microstates and\nmacrostates for a given N and Nc that satisfy hardsphere and minimal rigidity constraints and the relevant\npolymeric constraints. Each macrostate is characterized\nby an adjacency matrix that is nonisomorphic to and a\nset of interparticle distances {rij } that is different from\nthose characterizing other macrostates [20]. With this\ndefinition, no macrostate can be rotated or reflected such\nthat it yields a different macrostate. Every connected\nsticky hard-sphere macrostate admits a linear polymer\nmacrostate [14]. Thus, sticky-sphere and linear polymer\npackings have identical macrostates. We have also verified this for ring packings for N \u2264 10.\n\nfr /fm\n1\n0.88\n0.76\n0.68\n0.42\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\nfp /fm\n1\n0.94\n0.85\n0.78\n0.74\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\n\u03a9r\n5\n34\n273\n2668\n30663\n426590\n5905\n\n\u03a9p\n6\n50\n486\n5500\n71350\n1093101\n12138\n\n\u03a9m\n10\n195\n5712\n231840\n12368160\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\nA microstate is a particular labeling of the particles 1 through N that comprise a N -particle macrostate\nwith Nc contacts. Many microstates correspond to each\nmacrostate due to particle permutations for monomer\npackings [4], and for polymers, the multiple possible\npaths through a given macrostate. The total number\nof microstates \u03a9m , \u03a9p , and \u03a9r is given by the sum\nof microstates for each macrostate for monomers, linear polymers, and rings, respectively [20]. For monomer\npackings, which lack covalent bonds, the number of microstates for each macrostate (ignoring chirality) is given\nsimply by a geometric factor \u03a9im = Pi , where Pi is the\nnumber of allowed permutations of particle indices for\nmacrostate i [3]. For polymer packings, the number of\nmicrostates is not given by this relation since one must\nensure that particle indices are consecutive.\nExact enumeration results are displayed in Table I,\nwhich shows the number of macrostates M , fraction f\nof adjacency matrices with Nc contacts obeying minimal\nrigidity that also satisfy hard-sphere constraints, and \u03a9m ,\n\u03a9p , and \u03a9r for 5 \u2264 N \u2264 10. f is the probability to obtain\na packing for an 'ideal' protocol that samples adjacency\nmatrices uniformly. From Table I, we see that f decreases\napproximately exponentially with N for N \u2265 5, and even\nfaster for N > 9. Part of the reason for the strong decrease in f between N = 9 and 10 is the decrease in\nmacrostates from 52 to 3. This occurs because N = 10\nMEPs possess Nc = Ncmin + 1, which exceeds the number\nof degrees of freedom. Eq. 1 is then overconstrained, and\nits solutions possess special symmetries. The increase in\nNc signals the onset of crystal nucleation, and the formation of a close-packed core. The ability to enumerate\nthe numbers of isostatic (Nc = Ncmin ) and hyperstatic\n(Nc > Ncmin ) packings will yield insight into systems\nwhere glass and crystallization transitions compete.\nFor the N studied here, hard-sphere constraints are\nmore difficult to satisfy for minimally rigid polymer packings compared to monomer packings: fr < fp < fm [15].\n\n\f3\n\nFIG. 1: (a) Schematic of dividing surfaces S and S \u2032 (colored\ntriangles formed by monomers (B, C, D) and (D, E, F ), respectively) in a macrostate for N = 8. For S, region J consists\nof monomer A and region K of monomers (E, F , G, H), or\nvice versa. (b) Fraction of microstates for packings from each\nsymmetry group for cyclic (open circles) and linear (downward triangles) polymers, and monomers (filled circles) with\nN = 8. Results in (b) do not account for chiral structures.\n\nA key mechanism for the reduction in f is the occurrence of \"dividing surfaces\" in polymer packings. A dividing surface is any minimal subset of a connected cluster of contacting monomers that geometrically splits it\ninto two. Any polymer path that traverses a dividing\nsurface that does not also topologically divide the polymer is blocked and invalid. Specifically, if m consecutive\nmonomers i+1, . . . , i+m occupy an m-monomer dividing\nsurface S, any polymer path where the sets of monomers\nJ and K divided by S are anything other than 1, 2, . . . , i\nand i + m + 1, i + m + 2, . . ., N (or vice versa) is blocked.\nIn other words, any path that starts in J, enters S, and\ntraverses it (passes through all monomers in S) is blocked\nunless it traverses all monomers in J before entering S.\nFig. 1(a) schematically depicts the sets J and K and two\ndividing surfaces for a N = 8 macrostate. By definition,\nblocking does not occur in monomer packings.\nIn Table I, we see that the blocking effect increases\nsharply with N since fr /fm and fp /fm decrease significantly. Blocking also reduces [15] the fractions of allowed ring microstates relative to those for linear polymers fr /fp since rings do not possess chain ends. Another clear feature in Fig. 1(b) is that blocking changes\nthe relative frequencies with which macrostates of differ-\n\nent symmetries are populated. Ring and linear polymer\npackings are more likely to possess intermediate symmetry than monomer packings, whereas the opposite is\ntrue for macrostates with the lowest and highest symmetries. Highly symmetric macrostates possess many distinct blocking surfaces, and low symmetry macrostates\npossess a surplus of closed trimers as shown in Fig. 1(a).\nThe enumeration studies illustrate an interesting competition between energy and entropy in large systems.\nFor N \u2265 10, MEPs are overconstrained with Nc > Ncmin .\nThis suggests that if the system becomes trapped in a\nmetastable state (e.g. with Nc = Ncmin ), rearrangements\ninto MEPs will be slow because of their low entropy.\nThus, glassy dynamics in single polymer chains should\nbe observable in systems quenched at varying rates. For\nkB T \u226b |\u01eb|, where \u2212\u01eb is the contact energy, polymers will\nadopt random-coil configurations with Nc \u226a Ncmin . As\nthe polymer is cooled, one expects quench rate effects to\nbecome important when Nc \u2243 Ncmin [16].\nTo demonstrate glassy dynamics for single linear\npolymer chains, we employ MD simulations in which\nmonomers interact via the potential energy\n\u001a\nr\n\u2212 1)2 , r < rc\n\u2212\u01eb + k2 ( D\n,\n(2)\nUharm (r) =\n0\n, r > rc\nwhere k is the spring constant and D = 1 is the\nmonomer diameter. The temperature T is controlled\nvia a Langevin thermostat. The unit of time is \u03c4 =\np\nmD2 /\u01eb, where m is the monomer mass. The cutoff\nradius\np rc /D = \u221e for covalently bonded monomers and\n1 + 2\u01eb/k for noncovalently bonded monomers. Uharm\nreduces to the energy for tangent sticky hard spheres [17]\nin the limit k \u2192 \u221e and possesses the same MEPs. For\nN \u2264 10, the MEPs from simulations agree with those\n<\nfrom complete enumeration for k >\n\u223c 1600\u01eb (rc \u223c 1.04D).\nFigure 2(a) shows the potential energy per particle\n\u2212U/N \u01eb for different quench rates \u1e6a .

The crystallites consist of a closepacked core with Ncp monomers (each with 12 contacts)\nand a less-ordered exterior. The crystallization transition corresponds (Fig. 2(b)) to a sharp transition in Ncp ,\nwhich implies a change of symmetry within the core, from\nliquid-like to close-packed.\nAt higher rates, the dynamics becomes glassy near\nTmelt, and the systems do not approach the ground state\nenergy even as T \u2192 0. We associate the suppression of\ncrystallization with the onset of rigidity. Evidence for\nthis is given in Fig. 2(c). The data show two \"critical\"\nquench rates: \u1e6a \u2217 and \u1e6a \u2217\u2217 . For |\u1e6a | < |\u1e6a \u2217 |, the jump\nin Nc and Ncp resembles a first-order transition. For\n|\u1e6a | > |\u1e6a \u2217\u2217 |, the systems do not form minimally rigid\nclusters even at T = 0. Even though the critical rates\nand Tmelt are N -dependent, the trends are clear. For\nN = 100 systems, we estimate |kB \u1e6a \u2217 /\u01eb| \u223c 10\u22127 /\u03c4 and\n|kB \u1e6a \u2217\u2217 /\u01eb| \u223c 10\u22123 /\u03c4 .\n\n\f4\n\n-U/N\n\n1\n\n(a)\n\n2\n3\n\nFIG. 3: Collapsed structures at T = 0 for a single N = 100\nlinear polymer using two quench rates: kB \u1e6a \u03c4 /\u01eb = \u221210\u22124\n(left) and \u221210\u22127 (middle, right).

All results are averaged over several independent\ninitial configurations. The horizontal (vertical) dotted lines\nindicate Nc = Ncmin (kB T /\u01eb = 0.37).\n\nThe effects of quench rate on end states of quenches\nto T = 0 are visualized in Fig. 3. Monomers are colorcoded by the number of contacts; dark blue (red) indicates close packing (\u226a 12 contacts). The left panel\nshows a typical configuration after a fast quench with\nkB \u1e6a = \u221210\u22124 \u01eb/\u03c4 ; we see a small close-packed core surrounded by a disordered exterior. The middle and right\npanels show a collapsed structure at T = 0 from a slow\nquench (kB \u1e6a = \u221210\u22127 \u01eb/\u03c4 ). The close-packed core is\nmuch larger, and the exterior is more crystalline. The\nlarge gaps visible in the rightmost panel indicate the order is hcp, and the structure is stack-faulted [18].\nWe examined minimal energy packings of sticky tangent hard-sphere linear and cyclic polymers, and com-\n\npared them to monomer packings for small N . The\npackings are the same, but polymer packings possess significantly smaller entropies compared to monomer packings due to dividing surfaces, which arise from covalentbond constraints. Entropic suppression via blocking is\nstrongest for structures of both very high and low symmetry. In both monomer and polymer cases, the fraction\nof states satisfying hard-sphere constraints decreases at\nleast exponentially with increasing N , and faster when\nNc > Ncmin . We also performed MD simulations of single\nlinear chains with larger N , which link glassy dynamics\nto the onset of rigidity. This work sets the stage for future studies that investigate whether cooperative dynamics from chain connectivity and uncrossability constraints\nimproves or impedes glass-forming ability of single polymers compared to colloidal systems.\nWe thank V.

For\nmonodisperse hard spheres,\nAij = 1 if rij = D,\nAij = 0 if rij > D,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere rij = |~ri \u2212 ~rj | is the center-to-center distance between spheres i and j and D is their diameter. By convention, the diagonal entries satisfy Aii = 0.\nThe number of permutations for symmetric N \u00d7 N\nmatrices with Nconst constrained elements (e.g. covalent\nbonds) is\nPconst =\n\n[(N 2 \u2212 N )/2]!\n,\nNconst ![(N 2 \u2212 N )/2 \u2212 Nconst ]!\n\n(4)\n\nwhere the (N 2 \u2212N )/2 terms arise because we only need to\nconsider entries above the diagonal since \u0100 is symmetric.\nThe number of permutations Pcont for \u0100 with Nc stickysphere contacts has the same form as Eq. 4:\n[(N 2 \u2212 N )/2]!\n.\nNc !((N 2 \u2212 N )/2 \u2212 Nc )!\n\nPcont =\n\n(5)\n\nFor the packings considered in this study, the constrained elements correspond to covalent bonds, which\nare fixed to be 1 not 0. Thus, the number of permutations is\ni\nh\nN 2 \u2212N\n2\n\nPcct (Nconst ) =\n\n(Nc \u2212Nconst )!\n\n\u2212Nconst !\n\n\u0002 N 2 \u2212N\n2\n\n\u0003,\n\n(6)\n\n\u2212(Nc \u2212Nconst ) !\n\nwhere Nconst = 0, N \u2212 1, and N , for monomers, linear\npolymers, and rings, respectively. Specifically, for linear\nand ring polymers, Ai,i+1 = 1 for 1 \u2264 i < N . Rings\nmust also satisfy the constraint A1,N = 1. In contrast,\nmonomer packings do not have explicitly constrained offdiagonal elements.\nThus, the numbers of adjacency matrices for\nmonomers, linear polymers, and rings [22] for N particles\nand Nc contacts (including covalent bonds for polymers)\nare Pm = Pcont ,\nPlp = Pcct (N \u2212 1),\n=\n\n[N\n(Nc \u2212 (N \u2212 1))!(\n\n2\n\n\u22123N +2\n]!\n2\n\nN 2 \u22123N +2\n2\n\n,\n\u2212 (Nc \u2212 (N \u2212 1))!\n(7)\n\nand\nPr = Pcct (N ),\n=\n\n[( N\n\n(Nc \u2212\n\n2\n\n\u22123N\n]!\n2\nN 2 \u22123N\nN )!( 2\n\u2212 (Nc\n\n\u2212 N ))!\n\n.\n\n(8)\n\nWe then loop through all permutations Pm , Plp , and\nPr of \u0100 for a given N and Nc . Since the entries of \u0100\n\nare ones and zeros, different adjacency matrices correspond to unique binary numbers (i.e. each microstate\ncorresponds to a particular adjacency matrix and unique\nbinary number). We enumerate all binary numbers using\nsequential binary permutations (from the C++ Standard\nTemplate Library next permutation() function). Note\nthat considering polymers leads to an exponential reduction in the effort required for exact enumeration.\nSince we are interested in minimal energy packings\n(MEPs)-those with the maximum number of contacts\nNc , we focus on packings with Nc \u2265 Ncmin , where\nNcmin \u2261 3N \u2212 6 is the minimal number of contacts required for rigidity. For 4 \u2264 N \u2264 9, we verified that no\nmicrostates with Nc > Ncmin satisfy hard sphere constraints (as shown previously [2]), and for N = 10 no\nmicrostates with Nc = Ncmin + 2 exist, i.e. MEPs for\n4 \u2264 N \u2264 9 possess Nc = Ncmin and for N = 10 possess\nNc = Ncmin + 1.\nTo eliminate adjacency matrices that do not satisfy\nhard-sphere constraints, we employed the complete set\nof geometrical rules for the adjacency matrices for N \u2264 7\nprovided in Ref. [3]. Specifically, we implemented rules\n1-12, 14 \u2212 18 outlined on pages 295-318. However, we did\nnot employ the triangular bipyramid rule (discussed on\npages 40-48 of [3]), neither the version for iterative packings nor that applied to new seeds. Instead, for N > 7 we\ninserted those minimally rigid adjacency matrices not rejected by the geometrical rules into a modified version of\nArkus' Euclidean structure solver. The structure solver\nmakes a random initial guess for particle coordinates and\nthen uses Newton's method to solve the contact equations implied by the adjacency matrix, while enforcing\nhard sphere constraints. We checked for convergence of\nthe structure solver by increasing the maximum number\nof 'initial guesses' for the coordinates; 3N 3 initial guesses\nare sufficient to solve all structures to an accuracy in positions of 10\u22126 .\nClosely associated with \u0100 is the distance matrix D\u0304\nwhose elements are Dij = rij . For N < 10 and N = 10,\nNc = 25, nonisomorphic \u0100 (identified using the Boost\nGraph Library's isomorphism() function) correspond to\ndifferent macrostates because the elements of D\u0304 are different [23]. However, for N = 10, Nc = 24 graph\n(non)isomorphism (as given by isomorphism()) is insufficient to completely distinguish macrostates. While there\nare 286 nonisomorphic graphs, 8 of these produce coordinate solutions that are identical to those produced by\nother graphs. All eight of these correspond to 'switching'\na noncovalent bond in such a way that the same coordinate solution is produced. This reduces the total number\nof macrostates to 278.\nFor example, graphs 128 and 158 produce the same\nset of coordinates [21], but differ in that the former has\na noncovalent bond between particles 1 and 6, while the\nlatter possesses a noncovalent bond between particles 4\nand 7. We assume that graphs 128 and 158 correspond to\n\n\f6\nthe same macrostate because they possess the same D\u0304,\nbut (since the particles are distinguishable) the coordinate solutions correspond to different microstates [24].\nWe therefore have retained all microstates for all 286\ngraphs, but assign them to 278 macrostates. Adjacency\nmatrices for graphs 128 and 158 and their common coordinate solution are shown below in (9); red entries indicate the 'switched' bond.\n\nGraph 128:\n\n\uf8ee\n\n0\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef1\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef1\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef1\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef0\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef1\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef1\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef1\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8f01\n1\n\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n\n1\n1\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n\n0\n1\n1\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n1\n1\n0\n1\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\uf8ee\n\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n\n1\n1\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n\n0\n1\n1\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n1\n0\n1\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n\n\uf8f9\n\n0\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef1\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef1\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef1\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef0\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef0\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef1\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef1\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8f01\n1\n\nGraph 158:\n\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fb\n\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fb\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8f9\n0\n0\n0\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n0\n1\n0\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef \u22120.866025\n\uf8fa\n0.5\n0\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef \u22120.57735\n0\n\u22120.816497 \uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n1\n\u22120.816497 \uf8fa\n\uf8ef \u22120.57735\nCoordinates: \uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef 0.288675\n0.5\n\u22120.816497 \uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef 0.288675\n\u22120.5\n\u22120.816497 \uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef \u22120.481125 \u22120.833333 \u22120.272166 \uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\uf8f0 \u22120.7698 \u22120.333333 0.544331 \uf8fb\n\u22120.288675\n0.5\n0.816497\n\nfollowing harmonic interparticle potential\nUharm (r) = \u2212\u01eb +\n\n\u00112\nk\u0010r\n\u22121 ,\n2 D\n\n(10)\n\nwhere D = 1 and k must be large enough so that no\n'2nd-nearest neighbors' interact. We have examined the\nnumber of rigid macrostates as a function of k. For sufficiently high precision in the coordinates (one part in 106\nor better), all macrostates for 4 \u2264 N \u2264 8 are rigid (i.e.\nthe dynamical matrix possesses 3N \u2212 6 positive eigenvalues) for k/\u01eb > 10. For the eigenvalue threshold, we\nassumed that eigenvalues ei > 10\u22121 were nonzero and\npositive. For N = 9, we find one 'floppy' macrostate for\nall k/\u01eb > 400, consistent with Ref. [2]. We also verified\nthat all N = 10, Nc = 25 macrostates possess are rigid.\nFor N = 10, Nc = 24, however, the results show nontrivial dependence on the numerical precision of the coordinate solutions. When we solve for the coordinates\nto a precision of one part in 109 , we find 4 nonrigid\n(floppy) macrostates (in agreement with Ref. [2]) for all\nk/\u01eb > 400. However, when the coordinates are solved\nto a precision of only one part in 106 , one of the floppy\nconfigurations becomes 'rigid' in the same range of k due\nto insufficient precision.\nFigure 4 shows the eigenvalue spectra for the N = 10,\nNc = 24 macrostates for a precision of one part in 109 in\nthe coordinate solutions. The eigenvalues are displayed\nfrom smallest to largest: j = 1 to 3N . The 3N \u2212 6 positive eigenvalues for rigid macrostates are well-separated\nfrom the 6 eigenvalues that correspond to rigid translations and rotations as shown in panel (a). The eigenvalues corresponding to rigid translations and rotations\n(indexes 1-6) are zero to within our numerical precision.\nFor floppy macrostates, the floppy eigenvalues are also orders of magnitude below those that correspond to finiteenergy normal modes.\nSince nonrigid macrostates have floppy modes that\ncan be activated with no energy cost, each nonrigid\nmacrostate possesses a continuum of coordinate solutions. However, we have verified that none of the four\nfloppy macrostates for N = 10, Nc = 24 can be transformed continuously into one another (without increasing Uharm ). Specifically, we have shown that different\ncoordinate solutions corresponding to the same floppy\n\u22123\nmacrostate differ by <\n\u223c 10 D, while transitions between\nfloppy macrostates would require displacements \u223c D.\n\n(9)\n\nRigidity analysis\n\nThe rigidity of all macrostates generated by our exact\nenumeration algorithm was assessed by calculating the\neigenvalues of the dynamical matrix [25], assuming the\n\n[1] C.
