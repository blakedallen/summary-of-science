We have in mind few-body systems as well as many-body systems, ranging\nfrom different areas such as celestial and quantum mechanics or quantum chemistry (n-body problem, n-atomic molecules etc.). Despite the diversity of the\napplications they all share a fundamental underlying mathematical structure,\nin terms of kinematic concepts and internal space geometry, and the role of\nthe mass distribution. Here we shall focus attention on these basic structures,\nin a modern geometric and topological setting with orthogonal transformation\ngroups in the forefront. This approach also establishes similar results for point\nmasses in any Euclidean spaces Rd , d \u2265 2.\nIn this introductory section we first give an overview of the paper, which\ntake up several different topics. Then, in the following subsections we introduce\nsome basic concepts and constructions which we shall return to later. Here\nthe presentation is rather informal or expository, with some comments on the\nhistory.\n\n2\n\n\f1.1\n\nA brief overview\n\nOur approach is to combine symmetry and kinematic geometric principles in the\nframework of equivariant geometry, exhibiting the importance of the classical\northogonal transformation groups and the associated orbit space constructions.\nThis enables us to investigate in a unifying way the notions of congruence, internal configuration space and internal symmetry group. Internal symmetries of\nn-body systems are investigated in Section 2 from a categorical viewpoint based\non pure geometrical principles. As we shall explain, for various reasons they\nshould be referred to as Jacobi transformations, but in the physics literature\nthey are also encountered as kinematic rotations or democracy transformations,\ncf. [17].\nSection 3 is largely devoted to the study of the topology of shape spaces in\ngeneral, and here it is natural to consider n-body systems in higher dimensional\nEuclidean spaces Rd as well. We shall exploit the fact that congruence and\ninternal symmetry for point masses in Rd combine together to a tensor product\nrepresentation of some O(d)\u00d7O(m), acting on the matrix space M (d, m) \u2243 Rdm\nby matrix multiplication. In short, a typical shape space is the orbit space\nM \u2217 = S p /O(d), where S p is the unit sphere of M (d, m). Now M \u2217 inherits the\naction of O(m) as its symmetry group, but on the other hand, M \u2217 also naturally\nembeds as an O(m)-invariant subset of the linear space Sym0 (m) of symmetric\nmatrices with zero trace. Of particular interest are the cases where S p /H \u2248 S q\nis also a sphere, H = SO(m) or O(m). They yield an infinite family of \"orbital\nfibrations\" S p \u2192 S q , which for q = 1, 2, 4 are the Hopf fibrations, cf. Section\n3.4.2.\nIn the study of many body systems, we apply the orbit space reduction to\nthe configuration manifold rather than to its cotangent bundle, as in the reduction method of Marsden-Weinstein which, for example, Iwai [13] applies to\nthe Hamiltonian system describing classical molecular dynamics. On the other\nhand, R. Littlejohn and his collaborators (cf. e.g.[16], [17], [18]) have investigated the gauge fields that arise on the reduced (i.e. internal) configuration\nspace, and our work is directly related to the geometric framework of their\ninvestigations.\nIn Section 4 we determine the geometric invariants of n-body systems,\nnamely polynomial functions on the configuration space which are both congruence invariants and internal symmetry (or democracy) invariants. The topic\nis certainly well understood in classical invariant theory, but we are also seeking symmetrized expressions for centered n-body configurations, that is, their\ncenter of mass is fixed at the origin.\nIn Section 5 we introduce the notion of the weighted root system of an\nn-body system with a given mass distribution. This is a geometric invariant\nwhich generalizes the notion of a root system of Cartan type An\u22121 in classical\nLie theory, and its underlying structure is actually inherent in various contexts.\nFor example, it encodes the data of the relative positions of the binary collision\nvarieties in the configuration space or shape space. We shall introduce it as a\nbookkeeping device for expressing the mutual distances between the n bodies\nin terms of the Jacobi vectors.\n3\n\n\fIn Section 6 we present, as a nice application of the weighted root system,\na simple proof of Moulton's classification of collinear central n-configurations\n(cf. [23]) which is also well adapted for numerical computations. Recall that\nthese are the configurations characterizing n collinear masses capable of a rigid\nuniform rotation under the mutual gravitational forces.\nThe present paper is essentially a preprint (with the same title) of the author from April 2002, prompted by the paper Hsiang [9] and the succeeding\njoint work [11]. Our Sections 5-6 recall the contents of [11], but in the present\npaper the topology of general shape spaces, the universal shape space and its\nlinear model, is a major topic. It turns out that some few-body shape spaces\nhave an interesting history in the literature. For example, it was surprising to\nfind that the quotient space of complex projective plane CP 2 modulo complex\nconjugation is topologically a 4-sphere, namely S 5 /O(2) \u2248 S 4 . Several independent and different proofs of this fact had already been published (cf. Arnold\n[2], [3], Kuiper[15], Massey[21]). Now we also find that our Section 3 has some\noverlapping with the more recent paper Atiyah-Berndt [1].\n\n1.2\n\nn-configuration space, internal space and shape space\n\nThe location of an n-body system is conveniently represented by its n-configuration\nX = (a1 , a2 , .., an ) where ai is the position vector of Pi . The n-tuple X is regarded as a vector in the free n-configuration space\nM\u0302n = R3 \u00d7 R3 \u00d7 .... \u00d7 R3 \u2243 R3n ,\n\n(1)\n\nnamely a Euclidean 3n-space with an orthogonal splitting reflecting the individual positions of the n point masses, which may possibly coincide. The\nmass distribution (m1 , m2 , .., mn ) is tacitly assumed to be fixed unless otherwise stated, and in general we assume mi > 0. The centered n-configuration\nspace is the subspace of dimension 3n \u2212 3\nX\nMn \u2282 M\u0302n :\nmi ai = 0,\n(2)\n\nconsisting of those n-configurations with its center of mass at the origin. M\u0302n\nhas the following mass dependent (Jacobi) kinematic metric, namely the inner\nproduct of X and Y = (b1 , b2 , .., bn ) is\nX\nhX, Yi =\nm i a i * bi\n(3)\nThe isometry group of M\u0302n is the associated Euclidean group\n\n\u02c6 M\u0302n ) \u2243 R3n \u00d7O(3n)\n\u02c6\nE(M\u0302n ) = M\u0302n \u00d7O(\n= E(3n)\n\n(4)\n\nwhich we have expressed in the usual way as a semidirect product of the subgroups of translations and orthogonal transformations respectively.\nTwo n-configurations X and Y are regarded as congruent if their i-th components ai and bi differ by the same Euclidean motion in R3 for each i. Thus\nthe congruence relation is defined by the natural (diagonal) E(3)-action on M\u0302n ,\n4\n\n\fby which E(3) (resp. O(3)) is embedded as a subgroup of E(3n) (resp. O(3n)).\nThe space M\u0304n of congruence classes is the (congruence) moduli space, also referred to as the internal space. It may be viewed as the result of the two-step\norbit space constructionb\nM\u0302n \u2192\n\nMn\nM\u0302n\nM\u0302n\n\u2243 Mn \u2192\n=\n= M\u0304n\n3\nR\nO(3)\nE(3)\n\n(5)\n\nwhere in the first step the translation-reduced space is identified with Mn .\nThe second step is the orbit space construction of the transformation group\n(O(3), Mn ), from which it follows that M\u0304n is a stratified manifold of dimension\n3n \u2212 6 (cf. Section 3).\nNext, let us divide \"congruence\" into \"shape\" and \"size\" and use the squared\nnorm function I (cf. (7)), namely the polar moment of inertia, as a measure\nof the size of an n-configuration (or of its congruence class). Then M\u0304n has the\nstructure of a cone, where each ray emanates from the cone vertex (or base\npoint) O = (I = 0) and the ray represents a fixed shape. The shape space is\nthe space of rays, which we may regard as the orbit space\nM\u0304n \u2212 {0}\nMn \u2212 {0}\n=\n\u2243 Mn\u2217\nR+\nO(3) \u00d7 R+\n\n(6)\n\nwhere O(3)\u00d7 R+ is the group of similarity transformations of Euclidean 3-space\nwith the induced (diagonal) action on Mn . However, each ray has a unique point\nwhere I = 1, and therefore it is more convenient to identify Mn\u2217 with the subset\nof M\u0304n consisting of classes of unit size I = 1. Thus, the internal space M\u0304n is\nnaturally a cone over the shape space Mn\u2217 .\n\n1.3\n\nGeometrization, symmetry and reduction\n\nThe viewpoint that kinematics is a geometric discipline has a long history. For\nan n-body motion t \u2192 X(t), the fundamental kinematic quantities are\nX\nI = |X|2 =\nmi |ai |2\n2\n1X\n1\nmi |\u0227i |2\n(7)\nT = \u1e8a =\n2\n2\nX\n\u03a9 = X \u00d7 \u1e8a =\nmi ai \u00d7 \u0227i\nX\np=\nmi \u0227i\n\nThese are the moment of inertia, kinetic energy, angular\nand linear momentum,\n\u221a\nrespectively. In particular, the hyperradius \u03c1 = I is the norm of X in the\nn-configuration space (1) with respect to the inner product (3), and using T\nthe same metric may be presented as the kinematic Riemannian metric\nX\nds2 = 2T dt2 =\nmi (dx2i + dyi2 + dzi2 )\n(8)\n\nFurthermore, dynamics was incorporated in this geometric setting by the\nclassical geometrization procedure which dates at least back to the early 19th\n5\n\n\fcentury. Let us briefly recall the basic idea behind this, namely Jacobi's reformulation of Lagrange's least action principle, which goes as follows. When\ndynamics is taken into account and the above n-body motion is due to a force\nfield \u2207U derived from the potential energy \u2212U , the total energy h = T \u2212 U is\nconserved and the metric (8) should be conformally modified to the following\ndynamical metric\n(9)\nds2h = (U + h)ds2\ndepending on a fixed energy level h. Then the trajectories of total energy h\ncan be recovered as the geodesics of this metric. This applies, for example,\nto physically important n-body systems with potential functions (such as the\nNewtonian or Coulomb potential) depending on the pairwise distances rij =\n|ai \u2212 aj |. Therefore, they are invariant under the Euclidean group E(3), and\nconsequently both linear and angular momentum of the motion are conserved.\nSince the early days it has been an important issue how to fully utilize\nconservation laws. Sometimes these are first integrals associated with symmetry groups, and the reduction of integration problems using continuous (or\ninfinitesimal) symmetries dates back to Sophus Lie's work in the 1870's.\nClearly, the most effective usage of the invariance of linear momentum p\nis to choose an inertial frame at the center of mass, thereby reducing the configuration space M\u0302n to its subspace Mn (2) and hence the associated linear\nmomentum vanishes. A much harder problem is to further use the invariance\nof \u03a9, which is related to the congruence action of O(3) (or SO(3)) on Mn and\nits cotangent bundle. Namely, if T \u2217 denotes the cotangent bundle construction,\nconsider the two ways of reducing the phase space\nT \u2217(\n\nMn\n) = T \u2217 M\u0304n ,\nO(3)\n\nT \u2217 (Mn )\nO(3)\n\nto dimension 6n \u2212 12 and 6n \u2212 9, respectively. This suggests that the orbit\nspace reduction is most effective at the level of the configuration space rather\nthan the phase space.\nIn this paper we shall focus attention on two main issues. Firstly, it is important to construct appropriate coodinates for Mn , which is actually a problem\nwith no canonical or generally \"best\" solution. However, from the representation theory of O(3) and natural guidelines suggested by the splitting or invariance of the kinematic quantities, we are led to a natural approach whose origin\nmay, in fact, be ascribed to Jacobi. Secondly, we inquire about the structure of\nthe internal space M\u0304n , as an orbit space of Mn modulo O(3). It has the natural\nkinematic metric\nds\u03042 = 2T\u0304 dt2\n(10)\nwhere T\u0304 = T \u2212 T \u03c9 and T \u03c9 is the kinetic energy due to purely rotational\nmotion. Indeed, this metric is Riemannian and coincides with the induced\norbital distance metric (see e.g. [30]), and the reduction map Mn \u2192 M\u0304n is a\n(stratified) Riemannian submersion. As a consequence, the geodesics in M\u0304n are\nthe image curves of those geodesics (i.e., linear motions of constant speed) in\n(Mn , ds2 ) with vanishing angular momentum.\n6\n\n\fOn the other hand, the appropriate reduction of the dynamical equations\nin Mn to the level of M\u0304n is generally a hard problem even today. In Mn the\ngeometrization procedure yields the conformal modification of the kinematic\nmetric (8) leading to the dynamical metric (9). Similarly, one may search for a\nsimilar geometrization procedure at the internal space level, which should yield\na dynamical Riemannian metric on M\u0304n of type\nds\u03042h,\u03a9 = F (U, h, \u03a9)ds\u03042\n\n(11)\n\nin analogy with (9). However, this only works in special cases, for example, for\nthe (classical) planar n-body problem, but we leave this topic here.\nActually, in his study of celestial mechanics Jacobi himself abandoned the\nabove Riemannian geometric approach in favor of the increasingly successful\nHamiltonian formalism where, at the phase space level (symplectic geometry),\nideas involving symmetry, conservation laws and integrability questions have\nbeen continuously developed up to present time. On the other hand, with\nthe modern techniques of equivariant geometry, Lie transformation groups and\nrelated reduction theory and quotient constructions, the framework of Riemannian geometry and modern differential geometric techniques are now more\nreadily applicable for the study of n-body problems. We also refer to LittlejohnReinsch[17] for a general discussion with many references to the gauge kinematic\nand dynamics of many particle systems. For real historical background information on the geometrization of physics we also propose the survey article\nL\u00fctzen[19] on the 19th century interactions between mechanics and differential\ngeometry.\n\n1.4\n\nCongruence and internal symmetry in n-body spaces\n\nLet us explain the interaction of the notions of congruence and internal symmetry for n-body systems, where by congruence we mean O(3)-congruence and\nassume the translational degrees of freedom have been eliminated. For this purpose we introduce a notion somewhat more general than a free m-configuration\nspace (1), namely an m-body space\nM \u2243 R3m : (O(3), m\u03c13 )\nis a Euclidean 3m-dimensional space with an orthogonal representation of type\n(O(3), m\u03c13 ), that is, m copies of the standard representation \u03c13 of O(3). However, particles and mass distributions are not mentioned, and there is no specific decomposition into 3-dimensional invariant subspaces R3 as in (1). As an\nexample, we have in mind the centered n-configuration space Mn (2), where\nm = n \u2212 1 and the original mass distribution is disguised in the Euclidean\nmetric (3).\nOn the other hand, associated with R3m is the totality D(R3m ) of all orthogonal, O(3)-invariant and ordered decompositions\nR3m = V1 \u2295 V2 \u2295 . . . \u2295 Vm , Vi \u2243 R3 .\n\n(12)\n\nThen, for a specific choice of decomposition we can identify R3m with the free\nm-configuration space M\u0302m as in (1) and associate a particle Pi with position\n7\n\n\fvector ai to each summand Vi . Moreover, the metric on R3m viewed as a metric\non M\u0302m should have the form (3), so we also need a mass distribution. However,\nby suitably scaling of the vectors ai we are actually free to choose any mass\ndistribution since a vector in R3m written as an m-configuration (b1 , b2 , .., bm )\n\u221a\ndetermines position vector ai and mass mi modulo the constraint bi = mi ai\nfor each i (see Section 2.1).\nIn any case, R3m has the given conguence group O(3) \u2282 O(3m), and we define the internal (or inner) symmetries to be those transformations \u03c6 \u2208 O(3m)\nwhich commute with O(3), that is, \u03c6\u03c8 = \u03c8\u03c6 for each \u03c8 \u2208 O(3). By standard\nrepresentation theory (cf. Schur's lemma) these \u03c6 constitute a subgroup isomorphic to O(m), which we shall refer to as the (internal) symmetry group.\nThe two subgroups of O(3m) intersect at Z2 = {\u00b1Id} and hence combine to a\nsubgroup\nO(3) \u00d7 O(m)\n\u2192 O(3m)\nZ2\nwhich is also described mathematically by the tensor product \u03c13 \u2297 \u03c1m of their\nstandard representations.\nWe also point out that O(m) acts naturally on the set of decompositions\n(12). This action is, in fact, transitive and has isotropy group of type O(1)m ,\nand hence establishes a 1-1-correspondence\nD(R3m ) \u2243\n\nO(m)\nO(1)m\n\nTo be more explicit, let us fix some decomposition (12) and choose orthonormal bases to identify each Vi with R3 , and hence identify R3m in (12) with the\nspace M (3, m) of real 3 \u00d7 m- matrices\nX = (x1 , x2 , .., xm )\n\n(13)\n\nwith the standard Euclidean norm square\n2\n\nt\n\n|X| = trace(X X) =\n\nm\nX\ni=1\n\n|xi |2 ,\n\n(14)\n\nwhere xi \u2208 Vi is the i-th column vector of X. Then the action of \u03c8 \u2208 O(3) and\n\u03c6 \u2208 O(m) is just matrix multiplication on the left and right side respectively,\ninducing a joint left action on matrices by\n(\u03c8, \u03c6)X = \u03c8X\u03c6\u22121 (matrix multiplication)\n\n(15)\n\nThus congruence and symmetry combined together is the following tensor product representation\n(O(3) \u00d7 O(m), \u03c13 \u2297 \u03c1m , M (3, m)),\n\n(16)\n\nwhose orbit structure will be analyzed by combining two consecutive orbit space\nconstructions\nM (3, m) \u2192\n\nM (3, m)\nM\u0304 (3, m)\nM (3, m)\n= M\u0304 (3, m) \u2192\n=\n\u2243 C(\u2206)\nO(3)\nO(m)\nO(3) \u00d7 O(m)\n8\n\n(17)\n\n\fOf primary interest is the first orbit space, namely the internal space M\u0304 =\nM\u0304 (3, m) with its induced metric structure. The symmetry group O(m) descends faithfully to an induced transformation group on M\u0304 which is, in fact, its\nisometry group. Thus, the last step in (17) yields the final orbit space which is\ngeometrically the Riemannian cone over a spherical triangle \u2206 (resp. a circular\narc if m = 2) :\n\u001a 3\nR /B3 if m \u2265 3\n(18)\nC(\u2206) =\nR2 /B2 if m = 2\nOf course, this is a Euclidean cone. However, as indicated it is also the fundamental domain of the Weyl group B3 (resp. B2 if m = 2) in classical Lie theory,\nand this tells us that C(\u2206) embeds isometrically into M (3, m) as a cross section\nof the transformation group (16). Namely, C(\u2206) hits every orbit of that group\nat a unique point and, moreover, it is perpendicular to every orbit.\nWe refer to Section 3 for further analysis of the above orbit spaces, in a more\ngeneral setting involving all matrix spaces M (d, m) with the transformation\ngroups O(d) \u00d7 O(m), for any d \u2265 1.\n\n1.5\n\nJacobi vectors and the centered configuration space\n\nIn dynamics it is the conservation of linear momentum p that enables one to\nreduce the n-body problem to an (n-1)-body problem plus a trivial 1-body problem for the motion of the center of mass. To explain this, consider the canonical\northogonal and O(3)-invariant decomposition of the free n-configuration space\nM\u0302n = Mn \u2295 \u2206R3 , cf. (1)\n\n(19)\n\nwhere the subspace Mn \u2243 R3n\u22123 is the centered n-configuration space (2) and\nthe \"diagonal\" \u2206R3 = {(a, a, .., a)} is its orthogonal complement. For a motion\nX(t) in M\u0302n the vector a = a(t) is, indeed, the center of mass of X(t). Now,\nconservation of p means our inertial frame of reference will remain inertial if we\ntranslate the frame so that a becomes the new origin. Therefore, with respect\nto the new frame, the motion will take place in the summand Mn in (19).\nThis simple reduction is a key step in the integration of the classical Kepler\nproblem, where n = 2 and M2 \u2243 R3 \u2243 M\u03021 is the configuration space of a\nficticious 1-body system.\nHowever, for n > 2 Mn is just an (n-1)-body space and there is no canonical\nway of further decomposing Mn to become the configuration space of n \u2212 1\nficticious particles with appropriate position vectors and mass distribution, cf.\n(12). This fact is clearly reflected by the variety of types of coordinates for\nMn which can be found in the literature. Recall, for example, the efforts of\nLagrange, Jacobi and Delaunay who constructed their own \"good\" coordinates\nto study the classical 3-body problem (cf. e.g. Marchal [20]).\nOf particular interest to us is Jacobi's approach, which by repeated applications generalizes to n bodies, but again there is no canonical way of doing\nso. Anyhow, our interpretation of his basic idea is that a solution of the above\n\n9\n\n\fsplitting problem amounts to the construction of a transformation\n\u03a8 : Mn \u2192 M\u0302n\u22121\n\n(20)\n\n: (a1 , a2 , .., an ) \u2192 (x1 , x2 , .., xn\u22121 )\n\nwith the \"appropriate\" properties (see below), connecting the (n-1)-body space\nMn (with the Jacobi metric (3)) to a standard model, namely the free configuration space M\u0302n\u22121 with all masses equal to 1.\nBy viewing the vectors xi \u2208 R3 as the columns of a matrix (13) we may\nidentify M\u0302n\u22121 with the matrix space\nM (3, n \u2212 1) = R3 \u2297 Rn\u22121 =\n\nn\u22121\nX\ni=1\n\n\u2295R3i =\n\n3\nX\nj=1\n\n\u2295Rjn\u22121\n\n(21)\n\nwith the norm as in (14), congruence group O(3), symmetry group O(n \u2212 1)\nand their joint tensor product representation of O(3) \u00d7 O(n \u2212 1), see (15), (16).\nIn (21) we have also indicated that the column and row vectors of a matrix\nbelong to two different Euclidean spaces, having the standard action of O(3)\nand O(n \u2212 1) respectively.\nNow, what are those \"appropriate\" properties Jacobi transformations such\nas \u03a8 should satisfy ? In short, the answer is that \u03a8 is just an O(3)-equivariant\nisometry, that is,\ni) \u03a8(gX) = g\u03a8(X), g \u2208 O(3), ii) |X| = |\u03a8(X)|\n\n(22)\n\nLet \u03a8 in (20) be a given transformation of this type. It associates to a centered\nn-configuration X = (a1 , a2 , .., an ) its Jacobi vector matrix\nX = \u03a8(X) = (x1 , x2 , .., xn\u22121 ) \u2208 M (3, n \u2212 1)\nwhose column vectors xi will be referred to as the corresponding Jacobi vectors.\nOn the other hand, if \u03a8\u2032 is another Jacobi transformation, then the composition\n\u03a8\u2032 \u25e6 \u03a8\u22121 = \u03c6 is still an O(3)-equivariant isometry. Consequently, we can write\n\u03a8\u2032 = \u03c6 \u25e6 \u03a8 where\n\u03c6 : M (3, n \u2212 1) \u2192 M (3, n \u2212 1)\n(23)\n\nis a Jacobi transformation of the standard model (21), namely an orthogonal\ntransformation commuting with O(3). In other words, \u03c6 belongs to the symmetry group O(n \u2212 1) (acting on the matrices X by right multiplication). This\nexplains the non-uniqueness of \u03a8! Briefly, by knowing only one of the \u03a8\u2032 s we\nobtain all of them by composing \u03a8 with any \u03c6 \u2208 O(n \u2212 1).\nSo far, however, we have not constructed a single \u03a8 in (20), but we have\njust seen that this is all we need to do. We refer to Section 2.2 for the explicit construction of our standard choice \u03a8 = \u03a80 of Jacobi transformation\nand hence also our preferred choice of Jacobi vectors xi as distinguished linear\ncombinations of the vectors aj .\nRemark 1.1 Quantities which are invariant under the transformation group\n(O(n \u2212 1), Mn ) are also insensitive to the different orderings of the n bodies.\nTherefore, this group is sometimes referred to as the democracy group. Elements \u03c6 \u2208 SO(n \u2212 1) are also named kinematic rotations. See e.g. [17].\n10\n\n\f2\n\nJacobi transformations from a categorical viewpoint\n\nLoosely speaking, there is the category of m-body spaces whose objects are\nthe Euclidean spaces M \u2243 R3m with an orthogonal transformation group of\ntype (O(3), m\u03c13 ), and the morphisms will be called Jacobi transformations,\nnamely they are the O(3)-equivariant isometries M \u2192 M \u2032 between the spaces.\nHere the matrix space M (3, m) = M\u0302m is a distinguished object which also\nserves as our standard model (21). Therefore, for a given m-body space M a\n\"good\" coordinate system for M amounts to the choice of an appropriate Jacobi\ntransformation\n\u03a8 : M \u2192 M (3, m)\nand the columns of the matrix X \u2208 M (3, m) will be the Jacobi vectors with\nrespect to \u03a8. We are primarily interested in the centered n-configuration space\nM = Mn (where m = n \u2212 1).\nIn the following two subsections we shall characterize Jacobi transformations\nin several equivalent ways, and we start with the classical Jacobi construction\nwhich also justifies our usage of terminology.\n\n2.1\n\nTransformations of n-body systems and Jacobi's approach\n\nIn the Introduction we actually started (less formally) with the category of nbody systems, whose objects are n-tuples (P1 , P2 , ..., Pn ) of point masses Pi =\n(ai , mi ) with ai and mi as position vector and mass respectively. In this setting,\nwhat should be the appropriate morphisms\n\u03a6 : (P1 , ..., Pn ) \u2192 (P1\u2032 , ..., Pn\u2032 ) ?\n\n(24)\n\nAfter all, the usefulness of such transformations with the desired properties, to\nsimplify the further analysis, is well documented in both classical and quantum\nmechanics. First of all, we propose to consider transformations\n\u03a6:\n\n(a1 , ...., an ) \u2192 (a\u20321 , ...., a\u2032n )\n(m1 , ..., mn ) \u2192 (m\u20321 , ..., m\u2032n )\n\n(25)\n\nwhere the first map in (25) is an invertible linear transformation on M\u0302n = R3n\nwhich may possibly depend on the masses mi , with the choice of \"new\" masses\nm\u2032i constrained in some way. But \u03a6 also transforms the motions of n-body\nsystem and hence also the first three basic kinematic quantities in (7), so let us\ndemand that \u03a6 preserves them, namely\nX\nX\n2\nI=\nmi |ai |2 =\nm\u2032j a\u2032j\nX\nX\n2\n2T =\nmi |\u0227i |2 =\nm\u2032j \u0227\u2032j\n(26)\nX\nX\n\u03a9=\nmi ai \u00d7 \u0227i =\nm\u2032j a\u2032j \u00d7 \u0227\u2032j\nMotivated by an idea of Jacobi, we define the (i,j)-basic Jacobi transformation for i 6= j\n\u03c1ij : (P1 , ..., Pn ) \u2192 (P1\u2032 , ..., Pn\u2032 )\n(27)\n11\n\n\fby demanding Pk\u2032 = Pk , m\u2032k = mk for k 6= i, j, and\nmi mj\n)\nmi + mj\nmi ai + mj aj\nPj\u2032 = (a\u2032j , m\u2032j ) = (\n, mi + mj )\nmi + mj\n\nPi\u2032 = (a\u2032i , m\u2032i ) = (ai \u2212 aj ,\n\n(28)\n\nIn particular, Pj\u2032 is the center of mass of Pi and Pj , and m\u2032i is their reduced\nmass\nmi mj\n(29)\n\u03bcij =\nmi + mj\nAmong the basic Jacobi transformations let us also include the following mass\nnormalizing transformation\n\u221a\n\u03c10 : (ai , mi ) \u2192 ( mi ai , 1), \u2200i\n\n(30)\n\nand the permutation transformations\n\u03c3\u0304 : (P1 , ..., Pn ) \u2192 (P\u03c3(1) , ..., P\u03c3(n) )\n\n(31)\n\nwhich permute the vectors ai and masses mi covariantly, namely there is one\nfor each permutation \u03c3 of {1, 2, .., n}. It is straightforward to check that the\nabove transformations, and hence all their compositions, have the invariance\nproperty (26).\nNext, we inquire whether the above special transformations already generate\nall those \u03a6 with the property (26). This is affirmatively settled in the following\nsubsection, but first we shall make some clarifying observations. Note that\nvelocity vectors \u0227i of a motion are transformed in the same way as the position\nvectors ai and may well be regarded as vectors bi independent of the ai 's. In\nparticular, invariance of I means the same as invariance of T, namely that \u03a6 is\nan isometry. Therefore, the remaining issue is the nature of the invariance of\n\u03a9.\nConsider the 3n \u00d7 3n-matrix of a linear transformation \u03a6, regarded as an\nn \u00d7 n-matrix\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nB11 B12 .....\n[\u03a6] = \uf8ed B21 B22 ..... \uf8f8\n(32)\n....\n... ....\nwhere each block Bij is a 3 \u00d7 3-matrix. Such an \u03a6 expresses each a\u2032j as a linear\ncombination of the old ones, that is,\na\u2032i =\n\nn\nX\n\n\u03b2 ij aj , i = 1, .., n,\n\n(33)\n\nj=1\n\nif and only if each 3-block is a scaling matrix Bij = \u03b2 ij Id, where Id denotes\nthe identity matrix. Equivalently, \u03a6 commutes with the (diagonal) action of\nGL(3) on R3n and hence (by representation theory) belongs to the subgroup\nGL(n) embedded into GL(3n) by the tensor product action of GL(3) \u00d7 GL(n).\n12\n\n\fOn the other hand, assuming (33) holds \u03a6 will be an isometry (i.e. I is\npreserved) if and only if the n \u00d7 n-matrix (\u03b2 ij ) is \"orthogonal\" in the sense that\n(\u03b2 ij ) \u2208 D \u2032\u22121 O(n)D \u2282 GL(n)\n(34)\np\np\n\u221a\n\u221a\nwhere D = diag( m1 , ..., mn ), D \u2032 = diag( m\u20321 , .., m\u2032n ). Finally, assuming\n(33) and (34) it is easy to verify that \u03a9 is also preserved.\n\n2.2\n\nEquivalent characterizations of Jacobi transformations\n\nIt turns out that the invariance properties (26) are satisfied solely by demanding invariance of the vector \u03a9. This is elucidated by the following proposition\nwhere the angular momentum construction is analyzed from a purely algebraic\nviewpoint.\nProposition 2.1 Consider two n-tuples of vectors in 3-space\nX = (x1 , x2 , .., xn ), Y = (y1 , y2 , .., yn )\nand define their angular momentum vector by\n\u03a9 = \u03a9(X, Y ) =\n\nn\nX\ni=1\n\nxi \u00d7yi\n\nRegard X, Y as vectors in R3n = R3 \u00d7 .... \u00d7 R3 and consider general linear\ntransformations \u03a6 : R3n \u2192 R3n ,\nX \u2192 X \u2032 = (x\u20321 , x\u20322 , .., x\u2032n ),\n\nY \u2192 Y \u2032 = (y1\u2032 , y2\u2032 , .., yn\u2032 )\n\nThen \u03a6 preserves angular momentum, that is, for all X, Y\n\u03a9(X, Y ) = \u03a9(X \u2032 , Y \u2032 )\nif and only if \u03a6 is an O(3)-equivariant isometry.\nProof. The 3 \u00d7 3-matrices\n(k)\n\nSk = (sij ), k = 1, 2, 3,\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\nwhose only non-zero entries are sij = \u2212sji = 1 whenever (i, j, k) is an even\npermutation of (1, 2, 3), constitute a basis for the Lie algebra so(3) of all skewsymmetric matrices S. The action of SO(3) on R3n embeds each S as a \"diagonal block\" matrix\n\u2206(S) \u2208 so(3n)\nwith n copies of S along the diagonal. Observe that the matrices \u2206(Sk ) actually\nrepresent the three components \u03a9k of the vector \u03a9 , as skew-symmetric bilinear\nforms on R3n expressed as matrix products, namely\n\u03a9k (X, Y ) = X t \u2206(Sk )Y\n13\n\n\fwhere X, Y are regarded as column vectors with 3n components.\nLet us identify a transformation \u03a6 with its matrix in GL(3n). Those transformations leaving \u03a9k invariant constitute a matrix group Gk defined by the\nconstraint\n\u03a6t \u2206(Sk )\u03a6 = \u2206(Sk )\nand hence the group leaving \u03a9 invariant is the intersection G = G1 \u2229 G2 \u2229 G3\ndefined by the constraint\n\u03a6t \u2206(S)\u03a6 = \u2206(S), for all S \u2208 so(3)\n\n(35)\n\nThe proof amounts to show G = O(n) \u2282 O(3n), namely that G is the group of\nisometries commuting with O(3) (or equivalently with SO(3)).\nIf we knew \u03a6 is orthogonal, then we could have applied the exponential\nfunction to (35) to conclude that \u03a6 commutes with SO(3) and hence belongs\nto O(n). We claim, however, the isometry condition is itself a consequence of\n(35). To see this, write a typical matrix of the Lie algebra L(G) as an n \u00d7 nmatrix (Aij ) with blocks Aij , see (32). Then the infinitesimal version of (35)\nsimply reads\nAtij S + SAij = 0, for all i,j and all S \u2208 so(3),\nor equivalently\nAij = \u2212Aji ,\n\nAij = \u03b1ij Id\n\n(scaling matrix)\n\nHowever, these are precisely the conditions defining the Lie subalgebra so(n)\nand consequently G and O(n) have the same connected component SO(n).\nFinally, to show G = O(n) we use the fact that G lies in the normalizer of\nSO(n) in GL(3n), namely in the image of GL(3) \u00d7 O(n) by the tensor product\nrepresentation. Therefore, we may assume \u03a6 = \u2206(B) where B \u2208 GL(3) and\nhence by (35)\nB t SB = S for all S \u2208 so(3)\n\nThis condition says B leaves invariant all skew-symmetric bilinear forms in R3 ,\nand consequently B = \u00b1Id. This completes the proof.\nThe basic Jacobi transformations (27), (30), (31) are maps between nconfiguration spaces with possibly different mass distribution. However, using\nnormalizing transformations \u03c10 , as in (30), any composition may be \"pulled\nback\" to a transformation M (3, n) \u2192 M (3, n) and with all masses mi = 1.\nIn this interpretation, the (i,j)-basic Jacobi transformation \u03c1ij will be a (2dimensional) rotation \u03c1\u0302ij \u2208 O(n) and it is easy to check that \u03c1\u030212 , \u03c1\u030223 , \u03c1\u030213 generate a dense subgroup of SO(3) \u2282 SO(3) \u00d7 SO(n \u2212 3) \u2282 O(n). Therefore, all\nrotations \u03c1\u0302ij together with the permutations (31) generate a dense subgroup of\nO(n).\nAs a consequence of the above observations we now state the following\nresult on the characterization of Jacobi transformations, a terminology justified\nby (iii) below. In view of Section 1.3 we shall not attempt to define the angular\nmomentum vector \u03a9 in the broad category of n-body spaces, but in the following\ntheorem we refer to n-configuration spaces as defined in Section 1.1.\n14\n\n\fTheorem 2.2 The following four classes of linear transformations \u03a6 between\nn-configuration spaces are identical :\n(i) \u03a6 is an isometry which preserves the angular momentum vector \u03a9.\n(ii) \u03a6 preserves \u03a9 .\n(iii) \u03a6 is in the closure of the set of transformations generated by the basic\nJacobi transformations.\n(iv) \u03a6 is an O(3)-equivariant isometry.\nThe Jacobi transformations on a fixed (n-body or n-configuration) space are\nalso its symmetries (cf. Section 1.3), and they constitute a group isomorphic to\nO(n). In particular, the symmetry group for our standard model, namely the\nmatrix space M (3, n), is the group O(n) acting by matrix multiplication on the\nright side.\nTransformations which preserve angular momentum and kinetic energy are\ncertainly useful in quantum mechanics. Here one tries to keep operators \"separable\", that is, with no cross terms (cf. e.g. [6], \u00a710.1). As a consequence of the\nabove results Jacobi transformations provide all possible linear combinations a\u2032j\nof the vectors ai which preserve the kinetic energy operator, in the sense that\n\u0015\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0014\n1 2\n1 2\n1 2\n1 2\n\u01272\n\u01272\n\u2207 \u2032 + ... + \u2032 \u2207a\u2032n (36)\n\u2207 + ... +\n\u2207\n=\u2212\nT =\u2212\n2\nm1 a 1\nmn a n\n2\nm\u20321 a1\nmn\nA reduction of variables is achieved by choosing the transformation \u03a6 so that\na\u2032n becomes the center of mass vector and hence vanishes relative to a center of\nmass coordinate system. Then, for example, the (time dependent) Schr\u00f6dinger\nequation with potential energy V reduces to\n#\n\"\nn\u22121\n\u01272 X 1 2\n\u2202\n\u2032\n\u2032\n(\n\u2207 \u2032 ) + V (a1 , ..., an\u22121 ) \u03a8\ni\u0127 \u03a8 = \u2212\n\u2202t\n2\nm\u2032i ai\ni=1\n\nwhere \u03a8 = \u03a8(a\u20321 , ..., a\u2032n\u22121 , t). In the following subsection an explicit construction of such coordinates is given, and by usage of the symmetry group O(n)\nthey can be modified to satisfy additional properties for a specific purpose.\nOn the other hand, in the study of atomic structures one of the masses, say\nmn (the nucleus), may be relatively large and then non-Jacobian coordinates\nmay also turn out to be useful. However, in that case mass polarization terms\ncannot be avoided, namely mixed terms \u2207a\u2032i * \u2207a\u2032j will appear in the kinetic\nenergy operator (see e.g. Appendix 8 in [5]).\n\n2.3\n\nConstruction of Jacobi vectors\n\nHere we shall construct an explicit Jacobi transformation (20), or rather its\ninverse\n\u03a6 = \u03a8\u22121 : X = (x1 , x2 , ..., xn\u22121 ) \u2192 (a1 , a2 , .., an\u22121 , \u2212\n\n15\n\nn\u22121\n1 X\nmi ai )\nmn\ni=1\n\n(37)\n\n\ffrom M (3, n \u2212 1) to the centered configurations space Mn .

In this\nsetup we may and shall, however, discuss more generally the matrix space\nM = M (d, m) \u2243 Rd \u2297 Rm\nwith its Euclidean norm (14) and orthogonal transformation group\nG = G1 \u00d7 G2 = O(d) \u00d7 O(m)\nacting by the tensor product \u03c1d \u2297 \u03c1m , namely (\u03c8, \u03c6) \u2208 G acts on matrices X\nby\n((\u03c8, \u03c6), X) \u2192 \u03c8X\u03c6\u22121 (matrix muliplication)\n(49)\nPhysically, we have in mind M as the configuration space for m free bodies (or\nm + 1 bodies with fixed center of mass) in d-dimensional Euclidean space, and\nthe orbit space M\u0304 = M/G1 is the internal configuration space with the induced\naction of G2 as the internal symmetries. Therefore, for further investigation of\nthe topology of M\u0304 it is natural to analyze its induced G2 -orbital structure. Thus\nwe shall investigate two successive equivariant systems (G1 , M ) and (G2 , M\u0304 ),\nwhere by an equivariant system (K, Y ) we mean in general a (compact) Lie\ngroup K acting on a space Y . We also say (K, Y ) is a transformation group or\nwe simply say Y is a K-space, and it is convenient to refer to the orbit space\nconstruction and the orbit map\n\u03c0 : Y \u2192 Y /K\n18\n\n(50)\n\n\fas a K-orbital fibration. In (50) the \"fibers\" are the orbits, and therefore \u03c0 may\nnot be the projection of a fiber bundle (or fibration) in the usual sense since in\ngeneral the orbit type is not unique (see below).\n\n3.1\n\nCompact transformation groups and orbital decomposition\n\nFirst we shall recall some basic facts concerning equivariant systems (K, M)\nwhere K is a compact Lie group acting smoothly on a manifold M, that is, the\naction map K \u00d7 M \u2192 M is C \u221e -smooth. As a good reference on this topic we\npropose, for example, the book Bredon[7]. Then we specialize to the compact\nlinear groups, and of particular interest are the natural transformation groups\non the matrix spaces.\n3.1.1\n\nBasic definitions and constructions\n\nThe space M splits into a disjoint union of K-orbits; these are minimal (or\nhomogeneous) K-spaces in the obvious sense. The isotropy (or stability) groups\nKp at points p along the same orbit constitute a single conjugacy class (K\u03b1 ) of\nsubgroups representing the type of the orbit. For simplicity we say the orbit is\nof type K\u03b1 , and as a K-space such an orbit is naturally equivalent to the coset\nspace K/K\u03b1 . By grouping together orbits of the same type, M decomposes as\na union of orbit strata which are smooth submanifolds M\u03b1 , all of which have\ndimension less than M except the principal stratum M\u03c9 , which is an open and\ndense submanifold. The corresponding principal type K\u03c9 is characterized as\nthe unique smallest in the sense that (up to conjugation) K\u03c9 \u2282 K\u03b1 for each \u03b1.\nThe orbit map\n\u03c0 : M \u2192 M\u0304 = M/K\n(51)\ninduces a smooth functional structure on the orbit space, in the sense that a\nfunction f on M\u0304 is called smooth if the composition f \u25e6 \u03c0 is a smooth function\non M. Then M\u0304 is a differential space, but it may not be even locally Euclidean\nand hence it is not a manifold in general. However, still it has the nice and rich\nstructure of a stratified smooth manifold with the image sets M\u0304\u03b1 = \u03c0(M\u03b1 ) as\nstrata, and they are actually smooth manifolds. In this way we may regard M\nas a finite union of smooth orbit bundles denoted by\nK/K\u03b1 \u0592\u2192 M\u03b1 \u2192\u03c0\u03b1 M\u0304\u03b1\n\n(52)\n\nwhose fibers are those orbits of a fixed type K\u03b1 and \u03c0 \u03b1 is, in fact, the projection\nof an actual fiber bundle.\nFor convenience, let us recall the general notion of a (locally trivial) fiber\nbundle, typically illustrated by a sequence like (52)\nF \u0592\u2192 E \u2192\u03c0 B\n\n(53)\n\nwhere \u03c0 is the projection map, E (resp. B) is the total (resp. base) space, and F\ndenotes the typical fiber, that is, the fibers Eb = \u03c0 \u22121 (b) are homeomorphic to F\nfor each b \u2208 B. The simplest example is the product bundle, where E = B \u00d7 F\nand \u03c0 is the obvious projection. An isomorphism between two bundles over B\n19\n\n\fis given by a fiber preserving homeomeorphism \u03c6 : E1 \u2192 E2 between their total\nspaces, and a bundle is trivial if it is isomorphic to a product bundle. The local\ntriviality property (which is part of the definition) means that B is covered by\nopen sets U such that the portion \u03c0 \u22121 (U ) over U is a trivial bundle, that is,\n\u03c0 \u22121 (U ) \u2243 U \u00d7 F . Finally, the bundle is smooth if all the above spaces are\nsmooth manifolds and the maps involved are smooth.\nIn particular, a K-orbit bundle like (52) is defined by an equivariant system\n(K, E) with a single orbit type, and moreover, B is the orbit space E/K and\nhence the fibers are the K-orbits. A principal bundle (or principal fibration) is\nthe special case\nK \u0592\u2192 E \u2192 E/K = B\n(54)\nof (52) where K acts freely (i.e. all isotropy groups are trivial).\nWhen K acts by isometries on a Riemannian manifold M, there is an induced Riemannian metric on M\u0304\u03b1 so that the projection map \u03c0 \u03b1 in (52) is a\nso-called Riemannian submersion. Namely, the tangent map d\u03c0 \u03b1 at any point\np \u2208 M\u03b1 restricts to an isometry between the horizontal space Hp (i.e. vectors\nperpendicular to the orbit p\u0304 = K(p)) and the tangent space of M\u0304\u03b1 at the point\np\u0304. In this way the total orbit space M\u0304 in (51) becomes a stratified Riemannian\nspace; in particular, the strata are Riemannian manifolds. Moreover, M\u0304 has\nalso a global orbital distance metric which measures the distance between orbits\nin M (c.f. e.g. [9], [30]). This metric is certainly determined by its restriction\nto the principal stratum M\u0304\u03c9 , which in turn is derived from the Riemannian\nmetric on this stratum. Briefly, the Riemannian manifold M\u0304\u03c9 determines the\nRiemannian structure on each M\u0304\u03b1 .\nNext, we turn to the so-called slice theorem which reduces the local study\nof (K, M) to linear representation theory, as follows. The local representation\nof the isotropy group H = Kp at a given point p, denoted by (local)p in (55),\nis the induced linear action (via differentiation) on the tangent space Tp M of\nM at p. This splits into the isotropy and slice representation and we write\nTp M =Tp K(p) \u2295 Hp , (local)p = (Iso)p + (slice)p ,\n\n(55)\n\nto indicate that the isotropy representation is the H-action on the tangent\nspace Tp K(p) of the orbit K(p), and the slice representation is the induced\naction on some H-invariant complementary subspace Hp (which exists since\nH is compact). For example, when M is Riemannian we take Hp to be the\nhorizontal space, that is, the orthogonal complement of Tp K(p).\nNow, the slice theorem says the orbit K(p) has a K-invariant tubular neighborhood which has the structure of a twisted product K \u00d7H Hp , consisting of\nequivalence classes [k, v] in K \u00d7 Hp modulo the relation [k, v] = [kh\u22121 , hv], for\nk \u2208 K, h \u2208 H, v \u2208 Hp . The \"tube\" K \u00d7H Hp has the structure of a vector\nbundle over K(p) \u2243 K/H with fiber Hp , and moreover, as a K-space it has the\nfollowing left action\nk\u2032 [k, v] = [k\u2032 k, v], k\u2032 \u2208 K\nand consequently the isotropy groups at points in the tubular neighborhood of\nK(p) looks like\nK[k,v] = kHv k\u22121\n20\n\n\fIn particular, by calculating the slice representation (Kp , Hp ) as the difference\n(slice)p = (local)p \u2212 (Iso)p\n(56)\none can determine the orbit types that occur in the neighborhood. Moreover,\nthere is the following isomorphism of orbit spaces\n(K \u00d7Kp Hp )/K \u2243 Hp /Kp\n\n(57)\n\nwhich enables one to analyse the local smooth structure of orbit spaces by\nsuccessive application of the slice theorem.\nFinally, we recall the notion of a fundamental domain for (K, M), or equivalently a cross-section for the orbit map (51). This is a closed subset \u03a3 \u2282\nM which intersects each orbit in a unique point, and consequently there is an\nidentification\n\u03a3 \u2243 M\u0304\n(58)\nIn the special case that M is Riemannian and \u03a3 is an orthogonal cross-section,\nand hence the submanifold \u03a3 is also perpendicular to each orbit, the identification (58) is in fact an isometry. We remark, however, that fundamental domains\nin the above strict sense exist only in special cases \u2013 but fortunately including\nthose orthogonal transformation groups that we shall investigate below.\n3.1.2\n\nCompact linear groups on Euclidean spaces\n\nNow, let us consider pairs (K, V ) and the corresponding orbit map\n\u03c0 : V \u2192 V\u0304 = V /K\n\n(59)\n\nwhere K is a compact Lie group acting orthogonally on a Euclidean space V .\nSince the orbits are compact it is a well known fact that they can be separated\nby K-invariant polynomial functions pi . Namely, we can choose a Hilbert basis\nor \"sufficiently many\" separating and invariant polynomial functions pi as the\ncomponents of a map\np = (p1 , p2 , ..., pN ) : V \u2192 RN\nwhich induces an embedding\np\u0304 : V\u0304 \u2192 p(V ) \u2282 RN\n\n(60)\n\nand hence identifies the orbit space with its image p(V ). The latter is a semialgebraic subset, that is, it is defined by polynomial identities and inequalities\nin RN .\nConcerning smoothness, we recall that V\u0304 has, on the one hand, the structure\nof a differential space such that a function f on V\u0304 is \"smooth\" if and only if the\ncomposition f \u25e6\u03c0 is a smooth function on V . On the other hand, there is another\napproach defining a function on p(V ) to be \"smooth\" if it is the restriction\nof a smooth function on RN . Fortunately, the two notions of smoothness are\nidentical, and therefore we may regard the bijective correspondence p\u0304 in (60) to\n21\n\n\fbe a diffeomorphism, cf. Schwarz [24]. Consequently, f is \"smooth\" if and only\nif f \u25e6 \u03c0 = f \u0304 \u25e6 p for some smooth function f \u0304 on RN . Note, however, the orbital\ndistance metric on V\u0304 \u2243 p(V ) is certainly not induced from the Euclidean space\nin (60).\nIn the Euclidean space V size and shape are quantities preserved by orthogonal transformations. The norm \u03c1 = |X| is a size function which measures\nthe distance from the origin O, namely the arc-length along rays emanating\nfrom O. A nonzero vector can be uniquely scaled to unit size by a homothety\ntransformation X \u2192 cX (c > 0), and by expressing the Euclidean metric ds2\nof V in polar coordinates we actually describe V as a Riemannian cone over its\nunit sphere V 1 :\n(V 1 , d\u03b8 2 ) \u2282 (V, ds2 ),\n\nds2 = d\u03c12 + \u03c12 d\u03b82\n\n(61)\n\nwhere d\u03b82 denotes the induced spherical metric on V 1 .\nOn the other hand, the K-orbit space V\u0304 and its subspace V \u2217 = V 1 /K are\nstratified Riemannian spaces as explained above. Moreover, since the norm\nfunction \u03c1 is K-invariant it is also a size function on V\u0304 and then V \u2217 = (\u03c1 = 1)\nbecomes the unit distance \"sphere\". Furtermore, in analogy with (61) V\u0304 inherits\nthe structure of a stratified Riemannian cone over its \"sphere\" V \u2217 :\n(V \u2217 , d\u03c3 2 ) \u2282 (V\u0304 , ds\u03042 ), ds\u03042 = d\u03c12 + \u03c12 d\u03c3 2\n\n(62)\n\nwhere d\u03c3 2 denotes the orbital distance metric induced from d\u03b82 . In this cone\nthe rays emanating from the cone vertex (or base point), still denoted by O, are\nalso geodesics for the metric ds\u03042 , and homothety transformations move points\n6= O along these rays.\n3.1.3\n\nThe configuration space for m-body systems in d-space\n\nHenceforth, we take V to be the matrix space M = M (d, m) with the orthogonal\naction of G = O(d) \u00d7 O(m) as in (49). By regarding M as the configuration\nspace for an m-body system in Rd , in analogy with the \"physical world\" case\nd = 3 described in Section 1, G1 = O(d) and G2 = O(m) play the roles\nof congruence and internal symmetry groups respectively. Then there is the\nfollowing two-step orbital decomposition of stratified Riemannian spaces\nM \u2192 M\u0304 =\n\nM\u0304\nM\nM\n\u2192\n=\nG1\nG2\nG\n\n(63)\n\nwhere the internal configuration space M\u0304 = M\u0304 (d, m) and its symmetry group\nconstitute a natural equivariant system (G2 , M\u0304 ). Again, the metric (62) on M\u0304\nwill be referred to as the kinematic metric, since in the physical case d \u2264 3 it\nis, in fact, representing the internal kinetic energy\n1\n1\nT\u0304 = ds\u03042 = T \u2212 T \u03c9 = ds2 \u2212 T \u03c9 ,\n2\n2\nnamely the total kinetic energy T minus the purely rotational kinetic energy\nT \u03c9 of the n-body system, see e.g. [30].\n22\n\n\fThe internal symmetry orbit space M\u0304 /G2 , which is a cone in R\u03bc , \u03bc =\nmin {d, m}, is actually a Weyl chamber of Cartan type B\u03bc . Indeed, the Grepresentation on M is the isotropy representation of the symmetric space O(d+\nm)/O(d) \u00d7 O(m), which is of type B\u03bc , and as such it is well understood in\nterms of the classical invariant theory of matrices and canonical forms modulo\northogonal transformation groups.\nLet M 1 be the unit sphere of M. In view of the cone structure (61), (62),\nwe may faithfully replace (63) by its unit distance \"sphere\" version\nM1 \u2192 M\u2217 =\n\nM1\nM\u2217\nM1\n\u2192\n=\n= M \u2217\u2217\nG1\nG2\nG\n\n(64)\n\nwhere M \u2217 = M \u2217 (d, m) will be referred to as the shape space. Its G2 -orbit space\nM \u2217\u2217 is a spherical simplex and it is explicitly described in (85) below.\nThe orbit types of the above transformation groups will be described in\ndetail. In principle, the topological structure of the shape space M \u2217 can be\nreconstructed and analyzed as the union of well understood orbit bundles, but\nin this paper we shall only describe the global topology of M \u2217 in those few\ncases where it is a msnifold. In particular, the cases d = m \u2212 1 or d = m are\nrather simple since (G2 , M \u2217 ) is essentially isomorphic to a linear model, that is,\na sphere S N or disk D N +1 with an orthogonal action of G2 , see Section 3.4.3.\nBefore turning to these topics, let us have a closer look at some important\nclassical matrix spaces and their natural transformation groups.\n\n3.2\n\nTransformations of the space of symmetric matrices\n\nFor d \u2264 m, consider the following sets of m \u00d7 m-matrices\nSym+ (m)\u2264d\n\u2282 Sym+ (m) \u2282\n\u222a\n\u222a\n+\n+\n+\nB (d) \u2243 B (m)\u2264d \u2282\nB (m)\n\u2282\n\nSym(m) \u2282 M (m, m)\n\u222a\nB(m) \u2282 Diag(m) \u2243 Rm\n\n(65)\n\nwhere in the first row Sym(m) is the space of symmetric matrices, Sym+ (m)\nis the convex cone of positive semidefinite matrices, and Sym+ (m)\u2264d is the\nsubcone of matrices of rank at most d. In the second row Diag(m) is the space\nof diagonal matrices diag(\u03bb1 , ..., \u03bbm ), containing the cone\nB(m) = {Y = diag(\u03bb1 , \u03bb2 , ..., \u03bbm ); \u03bb1 \u2265 \u03bb2 \u2265 . .. \u2265 \u03bbm } ,\n\n(66)\n\nand the subcones B + (m) and B + (m)\u2264d are given by the additional constraint\n\u03bbm \u2265 0, and \u03bbi = 0 for all i > d, respectively.\nWith the usual inner product on M (m, m)\nY1 * Y2 = trace(Y1t Y2 ),\n\ncf. (14)\n\nwhere Y t means the transpose of Y , O(m) acts orthogonally by conjugation\n(\u03c6, Y ) \u2192 \u03c6Y \u03c6\u22121 ,\n\n\u03c6 \u2208 O(m), Y \u2208 M (m, m)\n\n(67)\n\nand the subsets in the first row of (65) are clearly invariant. Thus the transformation group (O(m), Sym(m)) is the second symmetric tensor product S 2 \u03c1m\n23\n\n\fof the standard representation \u03c1m = (O(m), Rm ), and let us recall the classical\nresult about diagonalization of symmetric matrices. Namely, every symmetric\nmatrix is conjugate to a unique matrix - its canonical form - in the cone B(m),\nwhich is therefore a fundamental domain (or cross section) of the orbit map\nSym(m) \u2192\n\nSym(m)\nRm\n\u2243\n\u2243 B(m) \u2282 Sym(m)\nO(m)\nSm\n\n(68)\n\nAs indicated, B(m) is also a fundamental domain (or cross section) for (Sm , Rm ),\nwhere Sm is the symmetric group acting on Rm by permuting the coordinates\n\u03bbi .\nFundamental domains for the O(m)-action restricted to invariant subspaces\nof Sym(m) are the corresponding subsets of B(m) in the second row of (65),\nconsequently\nB + (m) \u2243\n\nRm\nSym+ (m)\u2264d\nRd\nSym+ (m)\n\u2283\n\u2243\n\u2243 B + (d)\n\u2243\nBm\nO(m)\nO(m)\nBd\n\n(69)\n\nAs indicated, we recognize B + (k) as a Weyl chamber for the compact connected\nLie group SO(2k + 1), namely a fundamental domain of the canonical representation of the Weyl group Bk \u2283 Sk acting on Rk as a group generated by\nreflections.\nNote that Sym(m) is not an irreducible O(m)-space. In fact, there is the\northogonal and invariant decomposition\nSym(m) = Sym0 (m) \u2295 R1\n\n(70)\n\nwhere the trivial summand R1 is spanned by the identity matrix, and the first\nsummand, which consists of matrices of trace zero, gives the irreducible representation\nS 2 \u03c1m \u2212 1 with fundamental domain B 0 (m) \u2282 B(m) defined by\nP\n\u03bbi = 0 :\nSym0 (m)\nRm\u22121\n\u2243\n(71)\nB 0 (m) \u2243\nSm\nO(m)\nHere we have also recognized B 0 (m) as a fundamental domain of the canonical\nrepresentation of the Weyl group Am\u22121 = Sm of SU p\n(m).\nIn addition to its Euclidean norm where |Y | = trace(Y 2 ), the positive\ncone Sym+ (m) has another O(m)-invariant size function \u03c1\u2217 (Y ) = trace(Y ),\nwith corresponding \"unit sphere\"\n\b\nSym\u2217 (m) = Y \u2208 Sym+ (m) ; trace(Y ) = 1\n(72)\n\nFor later reference, we note that its intersection with the Euclidean unit sphere\nin Sym(m) is the subset\nSym\u2217 (m) \u2229 Sym(m)1 = Sym\u2217 (m)1 = {Y \u2208 Sym\u2217 (m) ; rk(Y ) = 1}\n\n(73)\n\nLet Y \u2208 B(m). The tangent space at Y of the O(m)-orbit through Y in\nSym(m) is the subspace\n[so(m), Y ] = {SY \u2212 Y S ; S is skew-symmetric} \u2282 Sym(m),\n24\n\n\f\u2032\n\nand it is perpendicular to B(m) since the inner product with any Y \u2208 B(m) is\n(SY \u2212 Y S) * Y \u2032 = trace((SY \u2212 Y S)Y \u2032 ) = 0\nA direct consequence of this observation is as follows :\nRemark 3.1 The fundamental domain B(m) of (O(m), Sym(m)) is an orthogonal cross section, in the sense that it is perpendicular to the O(m)-orbits.\nTherefore, the orbit space of Sym(m) (with the orbital distance metric) is isometric to B(m). Consequently, orbit spaces of various O(m)- invariant subspaces of Sym(m) in (65) are isometric to the corresponding subsets of B(m).\nFinally, let us determine the orbit types of the O(m)-action on symmetric\nmatrices. To this end, consider a matrix Y \u2208 B(m) and let the \"strings\" of\nequal entries \u03bbi in (66) have length m1 , m2 , ..., so that\nm = m1 + m2 + ... + mp\n\n(mi > 0, p > 0)\n\nis a partition of m and p is the number of different \u03bb\u2032i s. It is easy to see that\nthe isotropy group at Y is the \"block\" orthogonal matrix group\nO(m1 , m2 , ..., mp ) = O(m1 ) \u00d7 O(m2 ) \u00d7 ... \u00d7 O(mp ) \u2282 O(m)\n\n(74)\n\nand therefore the partition function \u03c0(m) of m enumerates the different orbit\ntypes. The orbits are in fact connected and therefore they are also SO(m)orbits, that is,\nSym(m)\nSym(m)\n=\n\u2243 B(m)\nSO(m)\nO(m)\n\n3.3\n\nAlgebraic realization of orbit spaces and orbital stratification\n\nWith the results from the previous subsection as a basis, the construction of the\norbit spaces in (63) or (64) as semialgebraic subsets is based upon the following\ntwo simple but fundamental properties of matrices :\n\u2022 The polynomial map\np : M (d, m)\n\n\u2192 Sym(m),\n\nX \u2192 Y = X tX\n\n(75)\n\npreserves the matrix rank, and its image consists of all positive semidefinite symmetric matrices Y of rank \u2264 min {d, m} . Moreover, for \u03c8 \u2208\nO(d), \u03c6 \u2208 O(m),\np(\u03c8X\u03c6\u22121 ) = \u03c6p(X)\u03c6\u22121 = \u03c6Y \u03c6\u22121\n\n(76)\n\nand the entries of Y are the inner products xi * xj of the column vectors\nxi of X.\n\u2022 Consider a finite collection of vectors xj in a Euclidean space Rd . Then\nthe collection is uniquely determined, up to O(d)-congruence, by the inner\nproducts xi * xj . For a proof we refer to Weyl[31], page 52.\n25\n\n\fThe map p in (75) is clearly constant on each O(d)-orbit in M = M (d, m)\nand induces a surjective map\np\u0304 : M\u0304 (d, m) \u2192 Sym+ (m)\u2264d \u2282 Sym(m)\n\n(77)\n\nwhich is, moreover, injective by the above mentioned result of Weyl. In other\nwords, the components of p, namely the collection of inner products xi * xj ,\nconstitute a Hilbert basis in the sense of Section 3.1.1. Consequently, p\u0304 is a\ndiffeomorphism between differential spaces which identifies M\u0304 = M/O(m) with\nthe set of positive semidefinite symmetric m \u00d7 m-matrices of rank at most d.\nIn particular,\nM\u0304 (d, m) = M\u0304 (m, m) \u2243 Sym+ (m) if d \u2265 m,\n\n(78)\n\nso we will henceforth assume without loss of generality that d \u2264 m. Thus we\nhave explained why all orbit spaces involved are realizable as appropriate spaces\nof symmetric matrices, amenable to the setting in Section 3.2.\n3.3.1\n\nCross sections and canonical foms\n\nIn general, the inclusions M (k, m) \u2282 M (k + 1, m), defined by taking the last\nrow to be zero, induce the increasing filtration\nM\u0304 (1, m) \u2282 M\u0304 (2, m) \u2282 ... \u2282 M\u0304 (m, m) \u2243 Sym+ (m)\n\n(79)\n\nand this coincides with the matrix rank filtration of the positive cone Sym+ (m),\nnamely for k + i \u2264 m\nM\u0304 (k, m) = M\u0304 (k + i, m)\u2264k \u2243 Sym+ (m)\u2264k\nOn the other hand, G2 = O(m) acts on the spaces in (77). The action\non M\u0304 = M\u0304 (d, m) is induced from the action (49), and G2 acts on Sym(m)\nby conjugation (67). From the equivariance property (76) it follows that these\nactions commute with the map p\u0304, that is, p\u0304 is an isomorphism of G2 -spaces and\nhence induces a diffeomorphism between G2 -orbit spaces\np\u0303 :\n\nM\u0304\nSym+ (m)\u2264d\nM\n=\n\u2192\n\u2243 B + (d) \u2282 Sym+ (m)\u2264d \u2243 M\u0304\nG\nG2\nG2\n\n(80)\n\nThe cross section B + (d) \u2282 M\u0304 in (80), being transversal to the G2 -orbits in M\u0304 ,\nfurther lifts to a cross section M + (d) of the composite orbit map M \u2192 M/G,\nas follows :\n\u001a\nX = diag(r1 , r2 , ..., rd )\n+\n+\nB (d) \u2243 M (d) \u2282 M :\n(81)\nr1 \u2265 r2 \u2265 ... \u2265 rd \u2265 0\nwhere X = (xij ) has xii = ri and zero entries otherwise. Thus we have also\nestablished the diagonalization procedure saying that every matrix in M =\nM (d, m) can be transformed by the action (49) to a unique matrix - its canonical\nform - in the subset M + (d). As a (simplicial) Euclidean cone in the {ri }coordinate space Rd , M + (d) is also the Weyl chamber of the Weyl group Bd ,\ncf. (69).\n26\n\n\f3.3.2\n\nOrthogonality of cross sections\n\nIn view of Remark 3.1, the cone M + (d) in (81) is orthogonal to the G-orbits\nand is therefore an orthogonal cross section for (G, M ). Hence, we have an\nisometry M/G \u2243 M + (d) of Euclidean cones with the metric\nds2 =\n\nd\nX\n\nd\n\ndri2 =\n\ni=1\n\n1X 1 2\nd\u03bb\n4\n\u03bbi i\n\n(82)\n\ni=1\n\nHere {ri } from (81) and {\u03bbi } from (66) are coordinate systems for the cone and\nare related by the polynomial map p in (75), which restricts to a diffeomorphism\np : M + (d) \u2192 B + (d) \u2282 Sym+ (m), ri \u2192 ri2 = \u03bbi\n\n(83)\n\nThus, the G-orbit of a given matrix X \u2208 M = M (d, m) has coordinates \u03bbi\ninterpreted as the eigenvalues of X t X. In the special case that d = m and X\nis symmetric, the numbers ri are the absolute values of the eigenvalues of X.\nRemark 3.2 At this point, observe that the internal configuration space M\u0304 =\nM\u0304 (d, m) has two metrics, namely the kinematic metric (i.e. the O(d)-orbital\ndistance metric) and the induced \"fake\" metric as a subset Sym+ (m)\u2264d of the\nEuclidean space Sym(m), cf. (77). For both metrics the symmetry group O(m)\nis actually an isometric transformation group with B + (d) as a fundamental\ndomainP\n(i.e. cross section). In the \"fake\" metric B + (d) inherits the Euclidean\nmetric\nd\u03bb2i and is by Remark 3.1 an orthogonal cross section, whereas in the\nkinematic (but still Euclidean) metric (82) of M\u0304 the orthogonality property of\nB + (d) fails. See also Remark 3.4 below.\n3.3.3\n\nRank and subrank stratification of matrix spaces\n\nThe subrank stratification of the matrix space M = M (d, m) is a natural refinement of the usual rank stratification. The latter coincides with the orbit type\nstratification of the action of G1 (or G2 ) on M and the mentioned refinement\ncoincides with the orbit type stratification of the action of the full group\nG = G1 \u00d7 G2 = O(d) \u00d7 O(m)\nIn order to describe the combinatorial structure involved we turn to the twostep orbital decomposition (64), where the first orbit space is the shape space\nM \u2217 = M \u2217 (d, m) \u2243 Sym\u2217 (m)\u2264d , cf. (72)\n\n(84)\n\nand the final G-orbit space is\nM \u2217\u2217 = M \u2217\u2217 (d, m) = M \u2217 /G2 = M 1 /G\nwhich we may identify with the following fundamental domain in the sphere\nM 1:\nX\n\u2206d\u22121 = M + (d) \u2229 M 1 : r1 \u2265 r2 \u2265 ... \u2265 rd \u2265 0,\nri2 = 1\n(85)\n27\n\n\fThis is a spherical simplex whose structure, indeed, identifies it with the spherical Weyl chamber of type Bd (see (69)); in particular, it is homeomorphic to\nthe closed disk D d\u22121 .\nThus we also conclude that the above simplex (85) is a cross section for the\ntransformation group (G, M 1 ), and hence any matrix in M 1 is G-equivalent to\na unique matrix - its canonical form - in the simplex. On the other hand, a\ntypical matrix of rank k in (85) may be characterized by the following numerical\ndata\n\nX:\n\n\u001a\n\nr1 = rk1 > rk1 +1P= rk1 +k2 > rk1 +k2 +1 = .... = rk > 0 = rk+1\n1 \u2264 pi=1 ki = k \u2264 d , ki > 0, p > 0,\n\n(86)\n\nand then its subrank is defined to be the corresponding (unordered) partition\nof k into p positive integers\n\u03ba = (k1 , k2 , ..., kp ) , |\u03ba| = k1 + ... + kp = k\n\n(87)\n\nwhich records the length of the strings of equal numbers in (86).\nWe label the rank (resp. subrank) stratum by the subscript k (resp. \u03ba) of\nthe corresponding sets. Thus X belongs to Mk1 if and only if its G1 -orbit has\nthe type O(d \u2212 k) (cf. also (100) below). Moreover, by (85) the image of Mk1\nin M \u2217\u2217 is the \"semi-open\" simplicial disk\nX\n: r1 \u2265 r2 \u2265 ... \u2265 rk > rk+1 = 0,\nri2 = 1,\nMk\u2217\u2217 \u2243 \u2206kk\u22121 \u2282 \u2206d\u22121\nk\nwhich is subdivided into its various subrank strata\n\nM\u03ba\u2217\u2217 \u2243 \u2206\u03bak\u22121 \u2282 \u2206kk\u22121 \u2282 \u2206d\u22121 \u2243 M \u2217\u2217\n\n(88)\n\nIn particular, the principal stratum has subrank \u03ba0 = (1, 1, ..., 1) with |\u03ba0 | = d,\nd\u22121 and is therefore\nand M\u03ba\u2217\u22170 \u2243 \u2206d\u22121\n\u03ba0 is the interior of the spherical simplex \u2206\nd\u22121\nhomeomorphic to R .\nTo see why the subrank stratification actually coincides with the G-orbit\ntype stratification, consider the isotropy group GX of the matrix in (86), using\nthe following notation for groups :\n\u2206H = diag(H \u00d7 H) \u2243 H (diagonal embedding)\n\nO(k1 , .., kp ) = O(k1 ) \u00d7 ... \u00d7 O(kp ) \u2282 O(k)\n\n(89)\n\nG(k1 , .., kp ) = O(d \u2212 k) \u00d7 \u2206O(k1 , .., kp ) \u00d7 O(m \u2212 k) \u2282 G\nThen it is not difficult to show by direct calculations with matrices that\n\b\nGX = (g1 , g2 ) \u2208 O(d) \u00d7 O(m) ; g1 Xg2\u22121 = X = G(k1 , .., kp )\n(90)\n\n(cf. Table 1, #10, in [27]), and hence the isotropy types uniquely characterize\nthe subrank strata, as claimed.\nWe are particularly interested in the stratification of M \u2217 , but now there\nare two natural options, namely the induced subrank stratification and the G2 orbit type stratification. Our next claim, however, is that they are identical,\n28\n\n\fand hence one can describe M \u2217 is a union of G2 -orbit bundles lying over the\nvarious strata (88).\nTo calculate the G2 -orbit types and how they correspond to the subrank\nstrata we proceed as follows. Let X \u2217 \u2208 M \u2217 be the image of a matrix X of\nrank k and consider the \"large\" orbit G(X) \u2282 M . As a G1 -space all the orbits\nof G(X) have the same type as the \"small\" orbit G1 (X). Moreover, the orbit\nspace G(X)/G1 \u2282 M \u2217 coincides with the G2 -orbit through X \u2217 , namely the set\nG2 (X \u2217 ). Thus, the \"large\" G-orbit through X has the structure of a G1 -orbit\nbundle, and in terms of homogeneous spaces (i.e. coset spaces of groups) this\nfiber bundle can be described as follows :\nG1 (X) \u2192\nq\nO(d)\nO(d\u2212k) \u2192\n\nG(X)\nq\n\n\u2192\n\nG2 (X \u2217 )\nq\n\nG\nG(k1 ,k2 , ..,kp )\n\n\u2192\n\nO(m)\nO(k1 ,k2 , ..,kp )\u00d7O(m\u2212k)\n\n(91)\n\nThe base space G2 (X \u2217 ) of the fiber bundle is in turn a fiber of another bundle,\nnamely the multistratum M\u03ba\u2217 which as a G2 -orbit bundle fibers as follows\nO(m)\n\u2192 M\u03ba\u2217 \u2192 M\u03ba\u2217\u2217 \u2243 \u2206\u03bak\u22121\nO(k1 , k2 , .., kp ) \u00d7 O(m \u2212 k)\n\n(92)\n\nIn this way the subrank stratification of the shape space\n\u2217\n\nM (d, m) =\n\nd\n[\n\nMk\u2217\n\nk=1\n\n=\n\nd [\n[\n\nM\u03ba\u2217\n\nk=1 |\u03ba|=k\n\nhas strata which are fiber bundles of type (92), and there are althogether\n\u03c0(1) + \u03c0(2) + ... + \u03c0(d)\n\n(93)\n\nsuch bundles (or strata), where \u03c0(k) is the partition function of k. The principal\nstratum M\u03ba\u22170 constitutes an open and dense subset of M \u2217 , and the principal\norbit bundle\nO(m)\n\u2192 M\u03ba\u22170 \u2192 M\u03ba\u2217\u22170 \u2248 Rd\u22121\n(94)\nd\nO(1) \u00d7 O(m \u2212 d)\n\nis actually trivial (e.g. since the base space is contractible). The orbit type,\neither for the G2 -action on M \u2217 or the G-action on M 1 , for a stratum of subrank\n\u03ba = (k1 , k2 , ..., kp ) can be read off from (91).\n\nExample 3.3 d = 3 : M (3, n \u2212 1) \u2243 Mn is the centered configuration space for\nn-body systems in 3-space. See Section 3.4.4 for a brief description of the shape\nspaces Mn\u2217 when n is small. In general, for n > 3 their G2 -orbit space\nMn\u2217\n= M \u2217\u2217 (3, n \u2212 1) \u2243 \u22062\nG2\nis the spherical triangle on the sphere r12 + r22 + r32 = 1 with vertices\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\nA = (1, 0, 0), B = (1/ 2, 1/ 2, 0), C = (1/ 3, 1/ 3, 1/ 3)\n29\n\n\fOn the circle r3 = 0 lies the closed circular arc of length \u03c0/4\n[A, B] : r1 \u2265 r2 \u2265 0\nwhich consists of those points of rank \u2264 2. It has three strata, namely the vertex\nA (of rank 1), the vertex B and the open arc (A, B) (both of rank 2). However,\nthe open arcs\n(A, C) : r1 > r2 = r3 > 0,\n\n(B, C) : r1 = r2 > r3 > 0\n\nconstitute the same stratum of subrank \u03ba = (2, 1). Thus, although the triangle\ndecomposes into 7 = 3 + 3 + 1 strata components, namely vertices, open edges\nand the interior of \u22062 , there are only 6 multistrata (since one of them has 2\ncomponents), in accordance with the enumeration formula (93).\nRemark 3.4 In general, the kinematic metric on the shape space M \u2217 is uniquely\ndetermined by its restriction to the principal stratum, which is a Riemannian\nmanifold (M\u03ba\u22170 , d\u03c3 2 ). There is a general procedure, in the setting of equivariant\ndifferential geometry, for the calculation (or description) of the Riemannian\nconnection on such a principal orbit bundle, see for example [4]. The simplest\ncase d = 3, as in the above example, is analyzed in Hsiang[9], but similar calculations can also be done for d > 3. We shall, however, leave the geometric\nissues here and concentrate on the topological structures in the sequel.\n\n3.4\n\nTopology of the shape space and related spaces\n\nFor fixed m the largest shape space (with d = m) is\nM \u2217 (m, m) \u2243 Sym\u2217 (m)\n\n(95)\n\nand by (84) it contains any other shape space\nM \u2217 (d, m) = M \u2217 (m, m)\u2264d \u2243 Sym\u2217 (m)\u2264d\nas the union of those strata of matrix rank at most d. Therefore, we shall refer\nto the space (95) as the m-universal shape space. Thus there is the increasing\nand O(m)-invariant rank filtration\nM \u2217 (1, m) \u2282 M \u2217 (2, m) \u2282 ... \u2282 M \u2217 (m, m)\n\n(96)\n\nand corresponding O(m)-orbit spaces \u2248 \u2206d\u22121 , 1 \u2264 d \u2264 m,\nM \u2217\u2217 (1, m) \u2282 M \u2217\u2217 (2, m) \u2282 ... \u2282 M \u2217\u2217 (m, m) = \u2206m\u22121\n\n(97)\n\nwhere the first three spaces in the chain (97) are, indeed, the inclusions of\nsimplices\n{A} = \u22060 \u2282 [A, B] = \u22061 \u2282 [A, B, C] = \u22062\nfrom Example 3.3.\n\n30\n\n\fBy inspection the chain in (96) starts with\nM \u2217 (1, m) = S m\u22121 /O(1) = RP m\u22121\nM \u2217 (2, m) = S 2m\u22121 /O(2) = CP m\u22121 /Z2\n\n(98)\n\nwhere\nRP m\u22121 \u2282 CP m\u22121 = S 2m\u22121 /SO(2)\nare the real and complex the projective (m-1)-space, and Z2 = O(2)/SO(2)\nacts on CP m\u22121 by complex conjugation with RP m\u22121 as fixed point set. In\nparticular, the vertex \u22060 = M \u2217\u2217 (1, m) of the simplex \u2206m\u22121 in (97) is the single\nO(m)-orbit M \u2217 (1, m), with the topology of a real projective space as noted\nabove.\nThe topology of the next shape space M \u2217 (2, m) is more difficult to describe.\nOne approach is to utilize the fact that it is a O(m)-space of cohomogeneity\none, that is, with one-dimensional orbit space. This holds since\nM \u2217 (2, m)\n= M \u2217\u2217 (2, m) \u2243 \u22061 = [A, B]\nO(m)\nis an interval. We also know the orbit types (K1 ), (K2 ), (H) corresponding\nto the three strata A, B and (A, B) respectively. Therefore, the space can be\ndescribed topologically in terms of its orbit types by the construction (cf. e.g.\n[29], Vol.1, Chap. IV) known as the equivariant union\nM \u2217 (2, m) = M (\u03c0 1 ) \u222a M (\u03c0 2 )\nof the mapping sylinders M (\u03c0 i ) of the canonical projections \u03c0 i : O(m)/H \u2192\nO(m)/Ki , where in our case\nK1 = O(1) \u00d7 O(m \u2212 1), K2 = O(2) \u00d7 O(m \u2212 2),\n\n(99)\n\n2\n\nH = K1 \u2229 K2 = O(1) \u00d7 O(m \u2212 2)\n\nThe space M \u2217 (2, 2) is a 2-disk and M \u2217 (2, 3) is actually homeomorphic to\nsee (104) and Section 3.4.4). For m > 3 M \u2217 (2, m) fails to be a manifold in\na neighborhood of the singular O(m)-orbit\n\nS 4,\n\nA = O(m)/K1 = M \u2217 (1, m) \u2243 RP m\u22121 ,\nbut two copies of M \u2217 (2, m) glued together along A yields, indeed, the differentiable manifold S 2m\u22121 /SO(2) = CP m\u22121 . Below we will return to this\nconstruction and further investigate the topology of the spaces M \u2217 (d, m) for\n2 < d \u2264 m.\n3.4.1\n\nLocal and global topology\n\nBy referring to Section 3.1 concerning compact transformation groups and the\nslice theorem, let us first recall a nice property of regular representations of\nclassical groups such as O(d). Namely, we consider the linear action of O(d)\non RN by some representation of type \u03a6 = m\u03c1d + \u03c4 q , N = md + q, which is m\n31\n\n\fcopies of the standard representation \u03c1d plus a q-dimensional trivial summand\n\u03c4 q . Then the orbit types constitute the following \"connected\" string of regular\nsubgroups\nO(k) ; d \u2212 m \u2264 k \u2264 d\n(100)\nwhere O(k) = 1 if k \u2264 0. To calculate the slice representation \u03a6k at a point\nwith isotropy group O(k) we calculate the difference as in (56), with the local\nrepresentation equal to \u03a6 restricted to O(k), that is, m\u03c1k + (trivial). Moreover,\nthe isotropy representation Iso(d, k) of O(k) is the \"linearized\" action on the\nStiefel manifold O(d)/O(k) = SO(d)/SO(k) at the base point, and a simple calculation (involving the adjoint representation of O(d)) yields the representation\n(d \u2212 k)\u03c1k + (trivial), consequently\n\u03a6k = \u03a6|O(k) \u2212 Iso(d, k) \u2261 (m \u2212 d + k)\u03c1k (mod trivial )\n\n(101)\n\nFrom this we conclude that each slice representation inherits the regularity\nproperty of the original action \u03a6.\nNow we turn to the \"left side\" action of O(d) on the matrix space M =\nM (d, m) \u2243 Rmd , which is just the regular representation \u03a6 = m\u03c1d . However,\nwe shall rather consider the restricted action on the unit sphere M 1 , noting\nthat the only change in the above calculations is that the local representations\nlose a trivial summand \u03c4 1 . The orbit types still constitute the string (100) and\nalso (101) holds, except that k < d in (100) since O(d) has no fixed point on\nthe sphere M 1 .\nLemma 3.5 (i) The m-universal shape space M \u2217 (m, m) \u2243 Sym\u2217 (m) is a manifold with boundary\n\u2202M \u2217 (m, m) = M \u2217 (m \u2212 1, m) \u2243 Sym\u2217 (m)\u2264m\u22121\n(ii) For p > 0, M \u2217 (d, d + p) is a manifold (and with no boundary) if and\nonly if p = 1 or d = 1.\nProof. By (57), the local topology of M \u2217 (m, m) around an O(m)-orbit of\ntype O(k) is the topology of the orbit space of the slice representation (O(k), \u03a6k )\nin M 1 , with m = d in (101). Hence, part (i) of the lemma follows by induction\non m \u2265 1, since at the initial step m = 1 the orbit space of (O(1), \u03c11 ) is the\nhalf-line R1+ = [0, \u221e) .\nFor the proof of (ii) we may assume d > 1, and the slice representation (101)\nof O(k) is \u03a6k = (k + p)\u03c1k (mod trivial). By induction the proof reduces to the\ncrucial singular case (O(1), (1 + p)\u03c11 ), where O(1) acts by inversion v \u2192 \u2212v,\np+1\nand here the orbit space is the cone RO(1) = C(RP p ) over the real projective\np-dimensional space. This is a manifold if and only if p = 1, in which case the\norbit space is homeomorphic to the Euclidean plane\nR2\n= C(RP 1 ) \u2248 C(S 1 ) = R2\nO(1)\n\n32\n\n(102)\n\n\fNext, let us actually determine the topological type of the compact manifold\n\u2243 Sym\u2217 (m) and its boundary. By the O(m)-action on M (m, m)\nevery X = (xij ) can be mapped to the subset\n\nM \u2217 (m, m)\n\nT + (m) \u2282 M (m, m)\nof upper triangular matrices with diagonal entries xii \u2265 0, and therefore the\nrestriction of the polynomial map in (75)\np : T + (m) \u2192 Sym+ (m)\n\n(103)\n\nis still surjective. The subset T + (m)m of matrices X with all xii > 0, i.e. of\nmaximal rank m, is clearly diffeomorphic to the Euclidean space Rm(m+1)/2 ,\nand it is easy to verify that different matrices X lie on different O(m)-orbits.\nTherefore the following lemma must hold.\nLemma 3.6 The polynomial map in (103) further restricts to a diffeomorphism\np : T + (m)m \u2243 Sym+ (m)m \u2243 Rm(m+1)/2\nwith the set of positive definite symmetric matrices. Hence, the interior of\nSym\u2217 (m) is the open \"sphere-octant\"\nX\nSym\u2217 (m)m \u2243 T + (m)m \u2229 M 1 (m, m) :\nx2ij = 1, xii > 0\n\nwhich is diffeomorphic to Rm(m+1)/2\u22121 .\n\nWe know from the previous two lemmas that Sym\u2217 (m) is a compact manifold with boundary and its interior is an open disk. Using some manifold\ntheory this information actually suffices to conclude that Sym\u2217 (m) is a closed\ndisk. For example, one may apply the so-called collar neighborhood theorem\nand the h-cobordism theorem, cf. Milnor[22]). Anyhow, we have the topological\ntypes\n\n\u2217\n\nM \u2217 (m, m) \u2243 Sym\u2217 (m) \u2248 D m(m+1)/2\u22121\n\u2217\n\nM (m \u2212 1, m) \u2243 Sym (m)\u2264m\u22121 \u2248 S\n\n(104)\n\nm(m+1)/2\u22122\n\nand taking the cone over these spaces yields the topological types\nM\u0304 (m, m) \u2248 Rm(m+1)/2\u22121 \u00d7 [0, \u221e)\n\nM\u0304 (m \u2212 1, m) \u2243 \u2202 M\u0304 (m, m) \u2248 R\n\n(half-space)\n\nm(m+1)/2\u22121\n\n(Euclidean space)\n\nRemark 3.7 The linear model construction in Section 3.4.3 provides another\nproof of the homeomorphisms (104).\n\n33\n\n\f3.4.2\n\nBranched coverings and generalized Hopf fibrations\n\nThe usage of SO(d) rather than O(d) as the congruence group acting on M (d, m)\nmay lead to a different \"shape space\", and we shall explain this distinction below. First, observe that for k \u2265 1 we have connected and hence equal orbits\nO(d)/O(k) \u2243 SO(d)/SO(k)\nand consequently the orbit spaces of SO(d) and O(d) will be identical as long\nas d > m, see (100). However, due to (78) we have been assuming d \u2264 m and\ntherefore k = 0 also occurs in the string (100), so the two orbit spaces cannot\nbe identical. In order to explain the difference the following discussion will be\nhelpful.\nConsider a space Q\u0303 with a given involution \u03c3 (i.e. a transformation of order\ntwo) and hence we shall regard Z2 = {Id, \u03c3} as a transformation group on Q\u0303.\nWe denote the orbit space of Z2 by Q and the fixed point set by \u03a3. We also\nassume \u03a3 6= \u2205 and regard it as a subset of both Q\u0303 and Q. Then the orbit map\n\u03c0 : Q\u0303 \u2192\n\nQ\u0303\n=Q\nZ2\n\n(105)\n\nis an example of a ramified double covering which is ramified along \u03a3. Conversely, starting from Q and \u03a3 we may reconstruct Q\u0303 as the double of Q\n2Q = Q \u222a\u03a3 Q \u2243 Q\u0303\nby taking two copies of Q and identify (or glue together) their \"singular\" set\n\u03a3. However, the pair (Q, \u03a3) does not always lead to a unique double space, so\nwe shall rather have in mind a specified ramified covering as in (105). Thus, we\ndefine for d \u2264 m\n2M \u2217 (d, m) = M \u2217 (d, m) \u222aM \u2217 (d\u22121,m) M \u2217 (d, m)\n\n(106)\n\nand refer to the orbit map\n2M \u2217 (d, m) \u2243\n\nM 1 (d, m)\nSO(d)\n\n\u2192\n\nM 1 (d, m)\n= M \u2217 (d, m)\nO(d)\n\n(107)\n\nof the action of O(d)/SO(d) = Z2 , which is, indeed, a double covering ramified\nalong the fixed point set M \u2217 (d \u2212 1, m) of Z2 .\nLemma 3.8 For p \u2265 0 and d > 1, the space 2M \u2217 (d, d + p) is a manifold (and\nwith no boundary) if and only if p = 0 or d = 2.\nProof. For d = 2 the SO(2)-orbit space is the complex projective space\nso let us assume d > 2. Using again the slice theorem and an inductive\nargument, the crucial case will be the topology of the orbit space of (SO(2), (p+\n2)\u03c12 ), namely the cone\nCP p+1 ,\n\nS 2(2+p)\u22121\nR2(2+p)\n= C(\n) = C(CP p+1 )\nSO(2)\nSO(2)\n34\n\n\fover the complex projective space CP p+1 . It is well known that this is a manifold (i.e. locally Euclidean) if and only if p = 0, in which case it is a cone\nhomeomorphic to Euclidean 3-space\nC(CP 1 ) \u2248 C(S 2 ) = R3\n\n(108)\n\nLemma 3.9 The induced smooth functional structure on the cone (102) (resp.\n(108)) is a refinement of the standard differentiable structure of R2 (resp. R3 ).\nThe structures are identical away from the origin (cone vertex), where the cone\nfails to be a smooth manifold.\nProof. Consider the case (108), namely the orbit space of (SO(2), 2\u03c12 )\nacting on R2 \u00d7 R2 . To describe it algebraically, let u, v denote vectors in R2\nand define the polynomial map\np = (X, Y, Z, W ) : R2 \u00d7 R2 \u2192 R4 , see (60)\n\nwhere X = |u|2 \u2212 |v|2 , Y = 2u * v, Z = 2(u \u00d7 v) * k, W = |u|2 + |v|2 , which\nidentifies the orbit space with the cone in 4-space\nX 2 + Y 2 + Z 2 = W 2, W \u2265 0\nBy projecting the cone onto the coordinate (X, Y, Z)-space we identify it with\nR3 as in (108), with (standard) coordinate functions X, Y, Z which are certainly\nsmooth in the\u221ainduced orbital functional structure. However, at the origin the\nfunction f = X 2 + Y 2 + Z 2 is not smooth with respect to the standard structure, although its composition with the orbit map is by our construction the\nsmooth function W. The case (102) is similar but simpler, using p = (X, Y, W )\nand (u, v) \u2208 R1 \u00d7 R1 .\nAccording to (104) and (107) we have constructions of orbital fibrations of\nspheres over spheres involving two types of orthogonal transformation groups,\nas follows :\nCase 1 : Consider the regular representation (O(m \u2212 1), m\u03c1m\u22121 ), acting on\nthe unit sphere M 1 (m \u2212 1, m) = S (m\u22121)m\u22121 with orbit space as in the\nsecond line of (104),\nS (m\u22121)m\u22121 \u2192\n\nS (m\u22121)m\u22121\n\u2248 S m(m+1)/2\u22122 , m = 2, 3, 4, ...\nO(m \u2212 1)\n\n(109)\n\nHere the initial case m = 2 is the trivial Hopf fibration or double covering\nO(1) \u0592\u2192 S 1 \u2192\u03c0 RP 1 =\n\nS1\n\u2243 S1\nO(1)\n\n(110)\n\nCase 2 : Consider the regular representation (SO(m), m\u03c1m ), acting on the\n2\nunit sphere M 1 (m, m) = S m \u22121 . The orbit space coincides with the\n\"double\" construction (106) applied to the first line of (104)\nM 1 (m, m)\n= 2M \u2217 (m, m) \u2248 2D m(m+1)/2\u22121 = S m(m+1)/2\u22121\nSO(m)\n35\n\n\fand there is the orbit map\n2\n\n2 \u22121\n\nSm\n\n\u2192\n\nS m \u22121\n\u2248 S m(m+1)/2\u22121 , m = 2, 3, 4, ....\nSO(m)\n\n(111)\n\nwhich for m = 2 is the well known Hopf fibration\nSO(2) \u0592\u2192 S 3 \u2192\u03c0 CP 1 =\n\nS3\n\u2243 S2\nSO(2)\n\n(112)\n\nRemark 3.10 With the induced differential structure the above quotient spheres\nare, of course, stratified differentiable manifolds (cf. Section 3.1) which are also\nlocally Euclidean spaces since they are spheres in the topological sense. In fact,\nfor m = 2 they are the standard sphere (i.e. S 1 or S 2 ) in the differentiable\nsense as well. However, for m > 2 there are more than one orbit type, and with\nthe induced differential structure they are actually not differentiable manifolds.\nHowever, this artificial situation can be remedied by \"relaxing\" the differential\nstructure so that the quotient sphere becomes the standard sphere while the map\n\u03c0 is still differentiable, see Section 3.4.3.\nRemark 3.11 The above orbital fibrations are natural maps between spheres\nwith specific properties, with possible future applications in physics. Indeed, the\nHopf fibration (112) is a simple special case with several well known applications. For example, it describes the geometry of a magnetic monopole, and\nDirac made the major discovery that the fibration could explain (in a modern\nlanguage) the quantization of electric charge. Here S 3 is the unit sphere of\nR4 = C2 , the action of SO(2) \u2243 U (1) extends to C2 by complex scalar multiplication, and the point magnetic source is at the origin of C2 /U (1) \u2248 R3 . The\n4-space R4 in this setting is also referred to as the Kaluza-Klein model of the\nDirac monopole.\nArnold[3] has considered the three special cases m = 2, 3, 5 of (109) from a\ndifferent viewpoint. Namely, they fit into the following unifying pattern with\nprojective spaces over R, C or H as intermediate quotient spaces :\ni) S 1 \u2192 RP 1 \u2243 S 1\n\nii) S 5 \u2192 CP 2 \u2192 CP 2 /O(1) \u2248 S 4\n\niii) S\n\n19\n\n4\n\n4\n\n\u2192 H P \u2192 H P / hAutH, Z2 i \u2248 S\n\n(113)\n13\n\nwhere O(1) \u2243 Z2 acts by (complex) conjugation and AutH \u2243 SO(3) is the\nautomorphism group of H (quaternions).The last two cases are two-step orbital\nfibrations defined by groups H \u2192 K \u2192 K/H, that is, K acts on the sphere\non the left side in (113), and the intermediate (projective) space is the orbit\nspace of the normal subgroup H, with the induced action of K/H. The groups\ncorresponding to the last two cases of (113) are as follows\nii) SO(2) \u2192 O(2) \u2192 O(1),\n36\n\niii) Sp(1) \u2192 O(4) \u2192 O(3)\n\n\fwhere O(3) = SO(3) \u00d7 Z2 \u2243 hAutH, Z2 i. However, from this viewpoint it is\nalso natural to include the cases m = 2, 4 of (111), where there is no group Z2 .\nCase m = 2 is the Hopf fibration (112) and the new case m = 4 reads\nS 15 \u2192 H P 3 \u2192 H P 3 /AutH \u2248 S 9\n\n(114)\n\nwith the corresponding groups Sp(1) \u2192 SO(4) \u2192 SO(3).\n3.4.3\n\nThe m-universal linear model\n\nWe shall describe another prperty of the m-universal shape space M \u2217 (m, m) \u2243\nSym\u2217 (m), which by (104) is known to be a disk whose boundary sphere is\nM \u2217 (m \u2212 1, m). In fact, what is remarkable is that the equivariant system\n(O(m), Sym\u2217 (m)) has a linear model, namely it \"resembles\" closely a Euclidean\ndisk with O(m) acting as an orthogonal transformation group. To make this\ncorrespondence precise, let us first inquire what is the appropriate linear model.\nRecall from Section 3.2 that O(m) acts orthogonally on the space Sym(m)\nof symmetric matrices of dimension m, namely by the symmetric tensor product\nrepresentation S 2 \u03c1m . Let Sym0 (m) be the subspace of matrices of trace zero,\nwhere O(m) acts by the irreducible representation S 2 \u03c1m \u2212 1, and let\nD 0 (m) \u2282 Sym0 (m)\n\ncf. (70)\n\nbe the unit disk centered at the origin. Then we make the following definition\nwhich will be justified below.\nDefinition 3.12 The above equivariant system (O(m), D 0 (m)) is the linear\nmodel of (O(m), M \u2217 (m, m)), and the restriction to the boundary sphere \u2202D 0 (m)\nis the linear model of \u2202M \u2217 (m, m) = M \u2217 (m \u2212 1, m).\nNow, we shall construct a 1-1 correspondence between Sym\u2217 (m) and the\ndisk D 0 (m) which is smooth and O(m)-equivariant, that is, the map commutes\nwith the action of O(m). To each matrix Y \u2208 Sym\u2217 (m), namely a positive\nsemidefinite matrix with trace 1, we associate the matrix\nr\n1\n1\n1\n(Y \u2212 Id) \u2208 Sym0 (m), where rm = 1 \u2212\n,\nY0 =\nrm\nm\nm\nand note that Y0 is perpendicular to the identity Id and\n|Y0 |2 =\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n(|Y |2 \u2212 ) = 2 (trace(Y 2 ) \u2212 ) \u2264 2 (trace(Y )2 \u2212 ) = 1\n2\nrm\nm\nrm\nm\nrm\nm\n\nTherefore, the O(m)-equivariant affine transformation\nSym(m) \u2192 Sym(m) : Y \u2192\n\n1\n1\n(Y \u2212 Id) = Y0\nrm\nm\n\nrestricts to an embedding\nSym\u2217 (m) \u2192 D 0 (m) , Y \u2192 Y0\n37\n\n(115)\n\n\f1\nbetween disks of the same dimension, which maps the geometric center m\nId to\n0\nthe origin, i.e., the center of D (m).\nThus, by a translation and homothety inside the Euclidean space Sym(m)\nthe convex subset Sym\u2217 (m) becomes, somehow, an \"inward\" equivariant deformation of D 0 (m), which by (73) fixes the subset Sym\u2217 (m)1 \u2243 RP m\u22121 lying\non the boundary sphere \u2202D 0 (m). In the simplest case m = 2 we have more\nexplicitly\n\u001b\n\u001a\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1 2\nu\nv\n2\n\u2217\n\u2243 D2\n(116)\nSym (2) =\n; (u \u2212 ) + v \u2264\nv 1\u2212u\n2\n4\n\nand the embedding (115) is actually a diffeomorphism.\nHowever, the embedding (115) is not surjective for m > 2, so let us explain\nhow to further deform equivariantly to make the embedding fill the whole unit\ndisk. First of all, by the convexity of Sym\u2217 (m) it follows that each ray in\nD 0 (m) from the origin passes through a unique point of the embedded sphere\n\u2202Sym\u2217 (m). In particular, by an additional scaling we obtaing a 1-1 correspondence between the boundary spheres of the two disks, and the final composition\n\u03c8 m : \u2202Sym\u2217 (m) \u2192 \u2202D 0 (m) = S m(m+1)/2\u22122 , Y \u2192 Y0 \u2192\n\n1\nY0\n|Y0 |\n\n(117)\n\nis certainly an O(m)-equivariant and smooth homeomorphism.\nOn the other hand, the above map may be extended to the whole disk,\nas follows. First of all, each ray from the origin intersects the embedded disk\nSym\u2217 (m) in a segment. So, let us stretch the segment outward along the ray\nuntil it has unit length, but with no stretching in a neigborhood of the origin.\nMoreover, the stretching must be specified by a function on the orbit space\nsince O(m)-equivalent segments must be stretched in the same way to make \u03c8 m\nequivariant. Following this procedure we certainly obtain an O(m)-equivariant\nand smooth homeomorphism\n\u03c8 m : Sym\u2217 (m) \u2192\u2248 D 0 (m)\n\n(118)\n\nwhich extends the map in (117). Such an equivariant and smooth homeomorhism is not unique, of course. The ambiguity lies in the group Dif fO(m) (D 0 (m))\nconsisting of all equivariant diffeomorphisms of the linear model. Yet, another\nconstruction of equivariant homeomorphisms like \u03c8 m is decribed briefly at the\nend of this subsection.\nIn summary, we arrive at the following result :\nTheorem 3.13 There is an O(m)-equivariant and differentiable homeomorphism \u03c8 m from the m-universal shape space M \u2217 (m, m) \u2243 Sym\u2217 (m) to its\nlinear model D 0 (m) \u2243 D m(m+1)/2\u22121 . For m = 2 this map is a diffeomorphism.\nBy referring to the following diagram\n\nR\n\n\u2190\u2212g\n\nM 1 (m, m)\n\u2193\u03c0\nSym\u2217 (m) \u2212\u2192\u03c8 m D 0 (m)\n38\n\n(119)\n\n\flet us explain the differential structure of Sym\u2217 (m) induced via the orbit map \u03c0.\nNamely, the function g is said to be smooth if the composed map g\u25e6\u03c0 is smooth.\nMoreover, smoothness of \u03c8 m means the composed map \u03c8 m \u25e6 \u03c0 is smooth, and\ntherefore we actually know (by our construction) that \u03c8 m is smooth.\nOn the other hand, for m > 2 there also exists a smooth map g such\n0\nthat g \u25e6 \u03c8 \u22121\nm is not smooth, as a function on the Euclidean disk D (m), and\nconsequently \u03c8 \u22121\nm cannot be smooth. Here we also refer to the discussion at the\nend of Section 3.4.4, together with Lemma 3.9 and Remark 3.10. Briefly, the\ndifferential structure on Sym\u2217 (m) induced via \u03c0 is a strict \"refinement\" of the\nstandard structure which Sym\u2217 (m) inherits from the Euclidean disk (via \u03c8 m ).\nRemark 3.14 We have seen that the m-universal shape space Sym\u2217 (m) has\ntwo naturally induced smooth structures, namely induced via \u03c0 and \u03c8 \u22121\nm respec\u2217\ntively, and they are different when m > 2. In fact, Sym (m) is not a smooth\nmanifold in the first case. But in both cases \u03c0 and \u03c8 m are smooth maps, but\nthe standard structure (induced via \u03c8 \u22121\nm ) is the only one that makes \u03c8 m an\nO(m)-equivariant diffeomorphism.\nFinally, let us turn to the natural simplicial structures of the orbit spaces\nof Sym\u2217 (m) and the disk D 0 (m), namely the following two spherical simplices\nX\nS m\u22121\nSym\u2217 (m)\n\u2243 \u2206m\u22121 =\n: r1 \u2265 r2 \u2265 ... \u2265 rm \u2265 0,\nri2 = 1\n(120)\nO(m)\nBm\nm\u22121\nX\nX\nD 0 (m)\n \u0304 m\u22121 = D\n\u2243\u2206\n: \u03bb1 \u2265 \u03bb2 \u2265 ... \u2265 \u03bbm ,\n\u03bbi = 0,\n\u03bb2i \u2264 1\nO(m)\nSm\n\nDespite the above theorem, which implies that \u03c8 m induces an O(m)-orbit type\n \u0304 m\u22121 , the two structures in\nstrata preserving homeomorphism \u03c8\u0304 m : \u2206m\u22121 \u2192 \u2206\n(120) are conspicuously different. The reason is that the simplicial structure\nin the first case of reflects the induced subrank stratification of Sym\u2217 (m) (cf.\nSection 3.3.3), namely the common refinement of the rank and O(m)-orbit\ntype stratification, whereas the simplicial structure in the second case is merely\nreflecting the pure O(m)-orbital stratification of the orthogonal transformation\ngroup O(m) on D 0 (m). Thus, by passing from Sym\u2217 (m) to its linear model\nD 0 (m) the notion of rank is seemingly lost. Therefore, let us also investigate\nhow the rank strata can be recognized in the linear model itself.\nRecall that M \u2217 (k, m) \u2282 Sym\u2217 (m) is the subspace lying above \u2206k\u22121 : rk+1 =\n... = rm = 0, and the rank k stratum is defined by the subset \u2206kk\u22121 \u2282 \u2206k\u22121 :\nrk > 0. This stratum has all the O(m)-orbit types\nX\nO(k1 , k2 , .., kp ) \u00d7 O(m \u2212 k),\nki = k , cf. (89)\n(121)\n\nlabelled by the various subranks \u03ba = (k1 , .., kp ) which record the strings of\nequalities among the numbers ri > 0, see (86), (87).\nOn the other hand, in the linear disk model any pattern of equality strings\namong the \u03bbi 's corresponds in the same way to a tuple \u03ba\u2032 = (k1 , .., kp , kp+1 )\nof positive integers, where k1 is the number of \u03bbi 's in (120) equal to \u03bb1 , k2 is\nthe number of \u03bbi 's equal to \u03bbk1 +1 etc., and the factor O(m \u2212 k) in (121) is\n39\n\n\freplaced by O(kp+1 ). In any case, the last factor O(m \u2212 k) (resp. O(kp+1 )) of\nthe isotropy group (121) is no more special than the other factors O(ki ), and\nthis clearly explains why the rank is not determined by the O(m)-orbit type.\nWe claim, however, the rank k is determined in thePlinear model by the\nidentity kp+1 = m \u2212 k provided the obvious condition\n\u03bb2i = 1 holds. The\n\u2217\nlatter condition merely says M (k, m) embeds as a subset of the sphere \u2202D 0 (m)\nand hencePaway from the interior D 0 (m) of the disk. The interior is, of course,\ngiven by\n\u03bb2i < 1 and here the rank is k = m. Moreover, by removing kp+1\nfrom the tuple \u03ba\u2032 we are left with the correct subrank tuple \u03ba. The above claim\nabout k will be settled below.\nAny O(m)-equivariant homeomorphism\n\u03c8 : Sym\u2217 (m) \u2192\u2248 D 0 (m)\nsuch as \u03c8 m , for example, induces an O(m)-orbital strata preserving homeomor \u0304 m\u22121 . Conversely, let us see how to start from \u03c8\u0304 and\nphism \u03c8\u0304 : \u2206m\u22121 \u2192 \u2206\nconstruct an appropriate lifting \u03c8 as above. The idea is to construct \u03c8\u0304 as a\nmap between fundamental domains with the O(m)-isovariant property, that is,\na point and its image point have the same isotropy group. Then \u03c8 will be the\nunique equivariant extension to all of Sym\u2217 (m). To choose appropriate funda \u0304 m\u22121 \u2282 D 0 (m) is a fundamental domain\nmental domains, first observe that \u2206\nif the numbers \u03bbi in (120) are regarded as the entries of a diagonal matrix.\nSimilarly, the following subset of diagonal matrices\nX\n \u0303 m\u22121 \u2282 Sym\u2217 (m) : \u03bb1 \u2265 \u03bb2 \u2265 ... \u2265 \u03bbm \u2265 0,\n\u2206\n\u03bbi = 1\n\u2217 (m). Then the O(m)-orbit map projection\nis a fundamental domain in Sym\n\u221a\n \u0303 m\u22121\n \u0303 m\u22121 \u2192 \u2206m\u22121 is just \u03bbi \u2192 \u03bbi = ri , see (83), and we note that \u2202 \u2206\n\u2206\nm\u22122\n \u0303\n\u2243\u2206\nis the subset with \u03bbm = 0.\nFor example, the above equivariant homeomorphism (118) between the\nboundary spheres corresponds to the O(m)-isovariant map\nm\u22122\nS m\u22122\n \u0304 m\u22121 \u2243 S\n \u0303 m\u22122 = \u2202 \u2206\n \u0303 m\u22121 \u2192\u03c8\u0304m \u2202 \u2206\n\u2243\u2206\nBm\u22121\nSm\n\n(122)\n\nwhich sends Y = diag(\u03bb1 , .., \u03bbm\u22121 , 0) to the matrix\n\nq\n\n1\n1\nY0 = diag(\u03bb1 \u2212 1/m, .., \u03bbm\u22121 \u2212 1/m, \u22121/m)\n|Y0 |\n\u03bb\n\n(123)\n\nwhere \u03bb = \u03bb21 + ... + \u03bb2m\u22121 \u2212 1/m.\nThe map (122) is isovariant since the inequality pattern among the entries\nof the matrix Y and its image is preserved. From this it is also clear that\n\u03bbk+1 = 0 if and only if the m \u2212 k last entries in (123) are identical. This also\nsettles the above claim concerning the rank k recognition in the linear model.\n3.4.4\n\nThe simplest shape spaces\n\nWe return to the shape spaces M \u2217 (3, m) together with their SO(3)-version for\nm = 2, 3, 4. Recall from Section 1 that M \u2217 (3, n \u2212 1) = Mn\u2217 is the shape space\n40\n\n\ffor the n-body problem, and for n = 3, 4, 5 the topological classification of these\nspaces are as follows :\nM 1 (3, 2)\nM 1 (2, 2)\nM 1 (3, 2)\n=\n=\n= D2\nO(3)\nSO(3)\nO(2)\nM 1 (3, 3)\nM 1 (3, 3)\nn = 4 : M4\u2217 \u2243\n\u2248 D5 ,\n\u2248 2D 5 = S 5\n(124)\nO(3)\nSO(3)\nM 1 (3, 4)\nM 1 (3, 4)\nn = 5 : M5\u2217 \u2243\n\u2248 S 8,\n\u2248 2S 8 = S 8 \u222aP S 8 (P = CP 3 /Z2 )\nO(3)\nSO(3)\n\nn = 3 : M3\u2217 \u2243\n\nWe shall make some further comments on the cases n = 3, 4.\nn = 3 : With the induced metric the disk D 2 is a hemisphere of the base space\n2D 2 =\n\nM 1 (2, 2)\n= CP 1 = S 2 (1/2)\nSO(2)\n\n(125)\n\nof the Hopf fibration (112), which is a round sphere of radius 1/2. Its\nequator circle M \u2217 (1, 2) = RP 1 = S 1 (1/2) represents the shapes of degenerate (i.e. collinear) 3-configurations. But in the study of the 3-body\nproblem it is, in fact, natural to use the whole sphere as the shape space.\nThe reason is that a non-degenerate 3-configuration in 3-space is geometrically a triangle which can be oriented in two different ways, by the\nordering of the vertices. Then the two hemispheres in (125) represent\ntriangles with opposite orientation, cf. [10], [12]. In this way a 3-body\nmotion corresponds to a continuous motion of a mass triangle whose orientation changes when the motion passes through an eclipse, that is, when\nthe shape curve crosses the equator circle.\nn = 4 : The boundary of the disk D 5 in (124) is the shape space of coplanar\n4-configurations, that is, the sphere\nM \u2217 (2, 3) = CP 2 /Z2 \u2248 S 4 (cf. (109) with m = 3)\n\n(126)\n\nand the action of its isometry group O(3) is equivalent (by Theorem 3.13)\nto that of its linear model (O(3), S 4 , S 2 \u03c13 \u2212 1). Namely, the linear model\nis the space of symmetric 3\u00d73-matrices with zero trace and unit norm,\nwith the natural action of O(3) by conjugation.\nThe fact that the quotient space CP 2 /Z2 is homeomorphic to S 4 was already\nknown to L.S. Pontryagin in the 1930's, according to Arnold[3], and we refer\nto [2], [15], [21] for different proofs of this specific result. Massey also observed\nthat the induced SO(3)-action on CP 2 /Z2 has the same orbit structure as that\nof the above linear model (SO(3), S 4 ), and the existence and construction of\nan equivariant homeomorphism (such as (117)) was, in fact, a problem stated\nby Massey. Moreover, Arnold[2] has constructions which are very close to our\nlinear model construction.\n\n41\n\n\fArnold also discusses the differentiable structure of S 4 , as a quotient space\nCP 2 /Z2 , and it is stated that CP 2 /Z2 is diffeomorphic to S 4 (cf. \u00a71 in [2]).\nHowever, what is shown is that the composite map\nM 1 (2, 3) = S 5 \u2192 CP 2 \u2192 CP 2 /Z2 \u2192\u2248 S 4\n\n(127)\n\nfrom S 5 to S 4 is differentiable (in the usual sense). Both CP 2 and CP 2 /Z2\nhave the induced smooth functional structure as quotient spaces of S 5 , but\nonly CP 2 becomes a differentiable manifold in this way. So, Arnold \"relaxes\"\nthe differential structure on CP 2 /Z2 so that the last map in (127) becomes a\ndiffeomorphism, that is, he defines the differential structure to be the standard\nstructure mentioned in Remark 3.14. This makes the last map in (127) a\ndiffeomorphism while the composed map S 5 \u2192 S 4 in (127) is still a smooth\nmap. The same applies, of course, to all the constructions S p \u2192 S p /K \u2192\u2248 S q\nin Section 3.4.2, where none of the \"quotient spheres\" S p /K is really a smooth\nmanifold when q \u2265 4.\nFinally, let us explain why the \"quotient spheres\" are not smooth manifolds.\nSince all cases are analogous we consider again the simplest case\nM \u2217 (2, 3) = S 5 /O(2) = CP 2 /Z2 \u2248 S 4\n\n(128)\n\nviewed as an O(2)-orbit space with the induced smooth structure. Then our\nclaim is that the orbit space in (128) is not a differentiable manifold in a neighborhood of the subset A = M \u2217 (1, 3) \u2243 RP 2 . To see this we shall apply the\nslice theorem (cf. Section 3.1.1), according to which each O(2)-orbit in S 5\nbelongs to a tubular neighborhood U whose image \u016a = U/O(2) in the orbit\nspace is an open set of type (57), namely diffeomorphic to the orbit space of\nthe slice representation. The set A represents those orbits of type O(1), and\nthe slice representation of O(1) acts on R4 with the eigenvalues (\u22121, \u22121, 1, 1),\nconsequently any point on A has an open neighborhood diffeomorphic to\n\u016a =\n\nO(2) \u00d7O(1) (R2 \u2295 R2 )\nR2 \u2295 R2\nR2\n\u2243\n\u2243\n\u00d7 R2\nO(2)\nO(1)\nO(1)\n\n(129)\n\nwhere the first factor is of type (102) and is transversal to the set A and the\nsecond is \u2243 \u016a \u2229 A. However, the product space in (129) is homeomorphic to\nR4 , but in view of Lemma 3.9 it is not a differentiable manifold.\n\n4\n\nGeometric invariants of n-body systems\n\nBy a geometric invariant on the centered configuration space\nX\nMn :\nmi ai = 0\n\nwe mean a polynomial function F (a1 , ..., an ) which is invariant under congruence and internal symmetries. We will describe the ring of all these invariants by\ncalculating the ring of invariants for matrix spaces M (d, m) in general. Denote\na typical matrix by\nX = (x1 , ..., xm ) = [x\u22171 , ..., x\u2217d ]\n42\n\n\fwhere the xi and x\u2217j are the column and row vectors respectively.

It is easy to verify the identity\nX\nX\n2\nIk =\nx\u2217i1 \u2227 x\u2217i2 \u2227 ... \u2227 x\u2217ik\n|xi1 \u2227 xi2 \u2227 ... \u2227 xik |2 =\n(134)\ni1 <i2 ....<ik\n\ni1 <i2 ....<ik\n\nfor each k = 1, .., d. Then, from the column vector version it is clear that Ik is\ninvariant under the action of O(d), and similarly the row vector expression is\ninvariant under the action of O(m). Hence, Ik is an invariant of G.\nLet us apply the reduction principle for orthogonal transformation groups\n(cf. e.g. [28]). Namely, we first calculate the reduced group of the action of\nG = O(d) \u00d7 O(m) on M , which is the quotient group\n\u1e20 = NG (H)/H \u2243 Bd\nand is finite in our case, where\nH = \u2206O(1)d \u00d7 O(m \u2212 d) \u2282 G, cf. (89)\n43\n\n\fis the principal isotropy group and NG (H) is its normalizer in G. Next we\ndetermine the fixed point set of H\nRd = F (H, M ) : X = diag(r1 , r2 , .., rd ), cf. (81)\nwhich contains the fundamental domain\nM + (d) \u2282 Rd \u2282 M : r1 \u2265 r2 \u2265 .... \u2265 rd \u2265 0\nof the G-action, identified with the orbit space of G in Section 3.3.1. Moreover,\nfor the G-orbit through X, ri2 = \u03bbi are the eigenvalues of X t X.\nFinally, we consider the induced action of \u1e20 on Rd , which is a group generated by reflections and as such it is the Weyl group Bd , having the above\ncone M + (d) as a fundamental domain. Now, the reduction principle says that\nthe restriction of polynomials induces an isomorphism between the invariant\nrings of (G, M ) and (\u1e20, Rd ). But the latter ring is certainly generated by the\nelementary symmetric functions\nP\nP\nP\n\u03bbi \u03bbj \u03bbk , . . . .\nI 1 = \u03bbi , I 2 =\n\u03bbi \u03bbj , I 3 =\ni<j\n\ni<j<k\n\nwhich are also the restrictions of the functions in (134), and this proves the\nlemma for masses mi = 1.\nNext, let M (d, m)(\u03bc) be the matrix space with the mass dependent metric\n(131) and consider the transformation\nM (d, m)(\u03bc) \u2192 M (d, m),\n\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\nX \u2192 XD = ( m1 x1 , m2 x2 , ..., mm xm )\n\nwhere the left and right hand space have metrics (131) and (130) respectively.\nThe transformation is a G-equivariant isometry, where O(m) acts on M (d, m)(\u03bc)\nby first applying the isomorphism\nO(m) \u2192 DO(m)D \u22121 = O \u2217 (m), cf. (132)\nHence, the transformation also induces an isomorphism of the corresponding invariant rings. In effect, the invariant ring of M (d, m)(\u03bc) is obtained by replacing\n\u221a\neach vector xi in (134) by mi xi .\nIn particular, the centered configuration space Mn \u2243 M (3, n \u2212 1) has the\nfollowing basic geometric invariants, in terms of the Jacobi vectors and classical\nvector operations :\nP\nP\nP\n|(xi \u00d7 xj ) * xk |2\n(135)\nI1 = |xi |2 , I2 =\n|xi \u00d7 xj |2 , I3 =\ni<j\n\ni<j<k\n\nfor all n \u2265 4. (For n = 3 the generators are I1 and I2 ). The expressions for\nIk hold for any choice of Jacobi vectors, but still it remains to express them as\nfunctions of a1 , ..., an . To this end, consider the free n-configuration space or\nmatrix space\nM\u0302n = M (3, n)(\u03bc) = {X = (a1 , a2 , ..., an )}\n44\n\n\fP\nwith the metric form I (\u03bc) =\nmi |ai |2 as in (131. By the above lemma its\ninvariant ring with respect to the group O(3) \u00d7 O \u2217 (n) has the basic generators\nP\nP\nI1 = mi |ai |2 , I2 =\nmi mj |ai \u00d7 aj |2 ,\n(136)\ni<j\n\nP\n\nI3 =\n\ni<j<k\n\nmi mj mk |(ai \u00d7 aj ) * ak |2\n\nand these are still complete and independent as invariants of the subgroup\nO(3) \u00d7 O\u2217 (n \u2212 1) acting on the subspace Mn \u2282 M\u0302n , as long as 3 \u2264 n \u2212 1. Here\nO\u2217 (n \u2212 1) \u2282 O\u2217 (n) is the internal symmetry group of Mn and is the subgroup\nleaving Mn invariant, or equivalently, the subgroup of O\u2217 (n) which under the\naction on Rn (row vectors) fixes the vector (m1 , m2 , ..., mn ). This proves the\nfollowing result.\nTheorem 4.2 The ring of geometric invariants of the centered n-configuration\nspace Mn is the polynomial ring generated by I1 , .., Iq in (136), q = min{3, n \u2212\n1}.\nRemark 4.3 Starting from the Jacobi vector expressions (135) of the invariants, a Jacobi transformation may transform them to expressions involving the\nvectors\nPai . In this way, however, we may arrive at a non-symmetric expression\nsince mi ai = 0. Below we shall give examples to illustrate the non-uniqueness\nof the symmetrization procedure and also give a geometric interpretation of In\u22121\nfor n = 3 or 4.\n\u2022 n = 3 : Let A be\nPthe area of the triangle spanned by the vector triple\n(a1 , a2 , a3 ) with\nmi ai = 0. By simple trigonometry\n2A =\n\nm\u0304\nm\u0304\nm\u0304\n|a1 \u00d7 a2 | =\n|a2 \u00d7 a3 | =\n|a3 \u00d7 a1 |\nm3\nm1\nm2\n\nOn the other hand, from the Jacobi vector formula (43),\nx1 \u00d7 x2 = \u03b6 1 \u03b6 2 a1 \u00d7 a2\nand consequently\nr\nm1 m2 m3\nA\n|x1 \u00d7 x2 | = \u03b6 1 \u03b6 2 |a1 \u00d7 a2 | = 2\nm\u0304\nand\nmi mj\n|ai \u00d7 aj |2\nmk\nm2 m3\nm3 m1\nm1 m2\n|a1 \u00d7 a2 |2 + m\u0304\n|a2 \u00d7 a3 |2 + m\u0304\n|a3 \u00d7 a1 |2\n= m\u0304\n3m3\n3m1\n3m2\n\nI2 = |x1 \u00d7 x2 |2 = m\u0304\n\nwhere {i, j, k} = {1, 2, 3} and the last sum is a symmetrization with all\nthree terms equal, in fact. However, the above expression for I2 and the\nsymmetric expression in (136) are identical as a function on M3 .\n45\n\n\f\u2022 n = 4 : Let V be the volume of thePtetrahedron spanned by the vector\nquadruple (a1 , a2 , a3 , a4 ) satisfying\nmi ai = 0. Then \u00b16V equals the\ntriple product of ai \u2212 a1 , i = 2, 3, 4, and\n6V =\n\nm\u0304\nm\u0304\n|(a1 \u00d7 a2 ) * a3 | =\n|(a2 \u00d7 a3 ) * a4 | etc.\nm4\nm1\n\nAgain, by expressing the Jacobi vectors xi in terms of the ai it follows\nr\nm1 m2 m3 m4\nV\n|(x1 \u00d7 x2 ) * x3 | = \u03b6 1 \u03b6 2 \u03b6 3 |(a1 \u00d7 a2 ) * a3 | = 3!\nm\u0304\nand consequently\nmi mj mk\n|(ai \u00d7 aj ) * ak |2\nml\nm1 m2 m3\nm2 m3 m4\n= m\u0304\n|(a1 \u00d7 a2 ) * a3 |2 + m\u0304\n|(a2 \u00d7 a3 ) * a4 |2 + etc.\n4m4\n4m1\n\nI3 = |(x1 \u00d7 x2 ) * x3 |2 = m\u0304\n\nwhere {i, j, k, l} = {1, 2, 3, 4} and the four terms in the last sum are\nequal. Again, I3 in (136) is an another symmetric expression for the same\nfunction on M4 .\nRemark 4.4 The cases n = 3 or 4 are special since, for example, their shape\nspace Mn\u2217 is topologically a disk D 2 or D 5 respectively. Moreover, in these cases\nMn\u2217 has a unique geometric center, and this may be characterized in several\nways. It is the unique fixed point of the symmetry group O(n \u2212 1), and the point\nhas the same distance to each of the binary collision varieties. Furthermore,\nit is also the maximum point of I2 or I3 respectively. That is, for a fixed size\nI1 = 1 the triangle (resp. tetrahedron) with the largest area (resp. volume) is at\nthe geometric center. In terms of Jacobi vectors the condition is that xi * xj = 0\nand |xi | = |xj | for i 6= j.\n\n5\n\nThe weighted root system of an n-body system\n\nA typical potential function U (a1 , a2 , ..., an ) of an n-body problem depends only\non the pairwise distances\nrij = |ai \u2212 aj | ,\n\n1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 n,\n\nand for certain applications one would like to express them in terms of Jacobi\nvectors xi , say\nX = (x1 , .., xn\u22121 ) \u2208 M (3, n \u2212 1)\nis the matrix associated with a given Jacobi transformation \u03a8 : Mn \u2243 M (3, n \u2212\n1). For this purpose we shall define and investigate the weighted root system,\ndepending on the mass distribution, which is primarily a book-keeping for expanding the vectors ai \u2212 aj as a linear combination of Jacobi vectors. It is\nnaturally a \"weighted\" version of the root system of type An\u22121 in classical Lie\ntheory, and they are identical when the mass distribution is uniform.\n46\n\n\f5.1\n\nDistance functions and the \u03a8-root system\n\nThe mutual distances rij have a nice geometric interpretation as functions on\nMn which measure the distance from specific subvarieties. To explain this,\nconsider the linear transformation\nM = M (3, n \u2212 1) \u2192 R3\ndefined by\nX \u2192 [u,X] =\nRn\u22121\n\nn\u22121\nX\n\nci xi = Xut\n\n(137)\n\ni=1\n\nwhere u = (c1 , c2 , ..., cn\u22121 ) \u2208\nis a given row vector of unit length and ut\nis the column vctor. Define the codimension 3 subspace B = Bu \u2282 M to be\nthe kernel\nB : [u,X] = 0.\nIt is easy to verify that the distance in M from a point X to the subspace B is\ngiven by the function\n\u03b4 B (X) = dist(X, B) = |[u,X]| =\n\n3\nX\nk=1\n\n1\n2\n\n(u * x\u2217k )2\n\nwhere the x\u2217k are the row vectors of X and the inner product on Rn\u22121 is the\nstandard one.\nIn particular, the binary collision varieties\nBij \u2282 Mn : ai = aj , i 6= j\n\n(138)\n\nhave associated distance functions \u03b4 ij of this kind, defined on M via a chosen\nJacobi transformation \u03a8 : Mn \u2192 M .

For general masses we make the following\ndefinition.\nDefinition 5.4 A weighted root system (of type An\u22121 ) with mass distribution\n(m1 , m2 , ..., mn ) is a collection of nonzero vectors\nwij = \u2212wji, 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 n,\n49\n\n\f\u221a\nin Rn\u22121 such that i) \u03bcij |wij | = 1 , ii) wik and wjl are perpendicular iff\n{i, k} \u2229 {j, l} = \u2205, and iii) the angle between wik and wkj is \u03b1i,j\nk , as defined by\n(148).\nThe \u03a80 -root system\nof such a root system, and clearly the\nn is our prototype\no\n1\nsubset of n-1 vectors \u221a\u03bc\nui,i+1 constitutes a system of simple roots for\ni,i+1\n\nobvious reasons, see (143), (145).\n\nTheorem 5.5 For a given mass distribution, each \u03a8-root system (see Definition 5.1) is a weighted root system in the sense of Definition 5.4, and conversely,\neach weighted root system is the \u03a8-root system for a unique Jacobi transformation \u03a8 : Mn \u2192 M (3, n \u2212 1). Moreover, for the given mass distribution all the\nweighted root systems are orthogonally equivalent.\nThis result is a simple consequence of the fact that any \u03a8 can be written\nuniquely as a composition\n\u03a8 = \u03c6 \u25e6 \u03a80 : Mn \u2192 M (3, n \u2212 1) \u2192 M (3, n \u2212 1)\nwhere \u03c6 \u2208 O(n \u2212 1) acts on M (3, n \u2212 1) by multiplication, that is, \u03c6(X) = X\u03c6.\n\u2032\nTherefore the Jacobi vector matrices X\nn and oX of \u03a80 and \u03a8, respectively, are\nrelated by X \u2032 = X\u03c6.

Moreover,\nsince the weighted root system spans all Rn\u22121 , any two of them are related by\na unique \u03c6 \u2208 O(n \u2212 1). In particular, a weighted root system is the \u03a8-root\nsystem for a unique Jacobi transformation \u03a8 = \u03c6 \u25e6 \u03a80 .\n\n5.4\n\nOn the role of the mass distribution\n\nThe mass distribution of a n-body system manifests itself through the various\nmass dependent quantities constructed above, for example :\n\b\n\u2022 the collection \u03bcij\n\nof reduced masses (29);\n\n\u2022 the weighted and normalized root system {\u00b1uij } ;\n50\n\n\f\u2022 the collection\nsystem.\n\no\nn\nof angles between the vectors of a weighted root\n\u03b1i,j\nk\n\nThe mass distribution (modulo scaling ) may, in fact, be reconstructed from\nany of these invariants.

The mass distribution determines, however, the representation\nof congruence classes as points in M\u0304n ; in particular, it determines the relative\nposition of the binary collision varieties. Conversely, we can reconstruct the\nmasses mi (modulo scaling) from knowledge of the position of these varieties.\nTo illustrate the last statement, consider the case n = 3, where M3\u2217 is a\nround hemisphere (or sphere, see Section 3.4.4) with a distinguished equator\ncircle S 1 representing the shapes of the degenerate triangles. On this circle lie\nthe three collision points b12 , b23 , b13 , where bij represents the shape of those\ntriangles (a1 , a2 , a3 ) with ai = aj 6= 0 and the center of mass at the origin.\nThe mass distribution determines their relative position, that is, the angles (or\ndistances) between the points bij , and once their position have been fixed we\nknow how to determine the position of any shape (cf. [12]).\nTo describe the relative positions of the points bij , consider S 1 as the circumscribed circle of the triangle \u2206 = \u2206(b12 , b23, b31 ) in a Euclidean plane with\norigin at the center of S 1 . It turns out that \u2206 is a central triangle, in the sense\nthat the center of its circumscribed circle lies in its interior. Moreover, the three\ncentral angles\nX\n0 < \u03b2 k < \u03c0,\n\u03b2 k = 2\u03c0\nMn\u2217 ),\n\nwhere \u03b2 k is opposite to the vertex bij (i, j, k different), are given in terms of the\nnormalized mass distribution by\n\u221a\nX\nm1 m2 m3\n(\nmi = 1)\nsin \u03b2 k = 2\n(mk + mi )(mk + mj )\nConversely, any central triangle can be realized in this way and the inversion\nformula is\n2 sin \u03b2 k\n(cf. [10] or [12])\nm k = 1 \u2212 P3\ni=1 sin \u03b2 i\n51\n\n\fwhere the positivity of mk , indeed, reflects the central property of the triangle\n\u2206.\nThe triple of angles (\u03b2 1 , \u03b2 2 , \u03b2 3 ) is in 1-1 correpondence with another triple\n(\u03b11 , \u03b12 , \u03b13 ), where\n\u03b1k = \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b2 k /2, k = 1, 2, 3\n(149)\nand these are the central angles of another central triangle, namely the triangle representing (up to congruence) the weighted root system of the mass\ndistribution (cf. Section 5.3). More precisely, whereas \u03b2 k = \u03b2 ij is the angular\ndistance between bik and bkj on the circle S 1 , \u03b1k = \u03b1ij is the angle between the\nnormalized root vectors uik and ukj since\nr\nmi mj\n,\ncf. (148)\ncos \u03b1k = uik * ukj = \u2212\n(mi + mk )(mk + mj )\nFinally, we recall that the root system of a k-body system is a weighted\nroot system of type Ak\u22121 . The way different A2 systems combine into higher\nrank systems Ak , k \u2265 3, is completely parallel to the \"standard\" theory of\nroot systems of type Ak , and therefore the higher rank case poses no further\nproblem.\n\n6\n\nCollinear central configurations revisited\n\nConsider the classical Newtonian potential function\nX mi mj\nU=\n|ai \u2212 aj |\n\n(150)\n\ni<j\n\nand its gradient field \u2207U with respect to the kinematic metric (8) in Mn (or\nM\u0302n ). An n-configuration X = (a1 , ..., an ) is called central if \u2207U (X) =\u03bbX for\nsome constant \u03bb, namely\n\u03bbai =\n\nX mj (aj \u2212 ai )\n1 \u2202U\n=\n, i = 1, ..., n\nmi \u2202ai\n|ai \u2212 aj |3\n\n(151)\n\nj6=i\n\nIn fact, \u03bb = \u2212I \u22121 U (X) where I = |X|2 , since by a classical result of Euler\nthe homogeneity of U implies \u2207U (X) * X = \u2212U (X). The collection of central\nconfigurations is clearly invariant under similarity transformations. Thus we\nmay fix a scaling of the vectors, say I = 1, and ask for solutions modulo O(3)congruence. Then the solutions are just the critical points of U as a function\nrestricted to the shape space Mn\u2217 . For n = 3 the only solution which is the\nshape of a non-degenerate triangle is the equilateral triangle (by Lagrange,\n1772), whereas there are three degenerate triangle solutions (by Euler, 1767)\nand they are represented by the three Euler points on the equator circle of M3\u2217 .\nEven the enumeration of all critical points in Mn\u2217 is, in fact, still an open\nproblem for n \u2265 4, and now the number also depends on the mass distribution.\nIt is only known to be finite for n < 5. However, the number of collinear\nsolutions is known to be n!/2 for all n \u2265 3, and the first proof was presented\n52\n\n\fby Moulton [23]. More recently, Smale [26] has given a topological proof using\nelementary Morse theory. In this subsection we shall give a similar and quite\nsimple proof using the weighted root system of an n-body system.\nAs usual, we assume that U in (150) is a function of n vector variables\nai linearly related by the condition that the center of mass is at the origin.\nActually this condition is a consequence of the identities (151). Anyhow, let us\nexpress U as a function of the n-1 Jacobi vectors\nX = (x1 , x2 , ..., xn\u22121 ) = [x\u22171 , x\u22172 , x\u22173 ]\ndefined by a fixed Jacobi transformation\n\u03a8 : Mn \u2192 M (3, n \u2212 1)\nwith associated root system {\u00b1wij }. Take, for example, the standard transformation \u03a80 and the expressions for the vectors xi and wij in Section 2.3 and\nSection 5.2. The (row) vectors wij and x\u2217k belong to the same Euclidean space\nRn\u22121 and by definition\n|ai \u2212 aj |2 =\n\n3\nX\nk=1\n\n(wij * x\u2217k )2 ,\n\n1\nwij = \u221a uij\n\u03bcij\n\n(cf. Section 5.1)\n\nThe gradient field \u2207U is tangential to the subvariety of collinear configurations and therefore the critical points we seek are also the critical points of U restricted to the subvariety of collinear shapes, namely M \u2217 (1, n\u22121) \u2243 RP n\u22122 . Let\nus represent all shapes of collinear type by n-configurations X = (a1 , a2 , .., an ) in\nMn with position vectors ai along the x-axis, and therefore the Jacobi matrix\nX has row vectors x\u22172 = x\u22173 = 0. Hence, we shall regard U as a function on the\n(n -1)-space\nRn\u22121 : x = x\u22171 = (x1 , ..., xn\u22121 )\nP 2\nand the condition I = 1 means restriction to the unit sphere S n\u22122 :\nxi =\n1. When antipodal points on this sphere are identified, we obtain the above\nprojective space RP n\u22122 , see (154) below.\nFor convenience, we shall identify the root vector wij with the linear functional\n\u03c9 ij : Rn\u22121 \u2192 R , \u03c9 ij (x) = wij * x,\nand regard the family\n\u2206 = {\u00b1\u03c9ij } = \u2206+ \u222a \u2206\u2212\nas the root system. The positive and simple roots are the subfamilies\n\u2206+ = {\u03c9 ij , i < j} \u2283 \u03a0 = {\u03c9 12 , \u03c9 23 , , , \u03c9 n\u22121,n } ,\nrespectively, with \u03c9ij = \u2212\u03c9 ji and \u03c9 ij + \u03c9 jk = \u03c9 ik , and following the \"usual\"\nprocedure we define hyperplanes\nHij = ker \u03c9 ij \u2282 Rn\u22121\n53\n\n\fwhich subdivide the space into disjoint, open and connected chambers Ci whose\nunion is\nC1 \u222a C2 \u222a .... = Rn\u22121 \u2212 \u222ai<j Hij .\nClearly, there are n! chambers, and each chamber C is distinguished by a specific\nchoice of signs \u03b5ij = \u00b11 such that\nx \u2208C \u21d4 \u03b5ij \u03c9ij (x) > 0 for all i < j\nBy changing all signs one obtains the antipodal chamber. In particular, our\nfundamental chamber C0 is the one with all \u03b5ij positive, namely\nC0 : \u03c9 ij (x ) > 0 for all i < j,\nor equivalently in terms of the positions ai = ai of the point masses (on the\nx-axis), since \u03c9 ij (x ) = ai \u2212 aj ,\na1 > a2 > .... > an\n\n(152)\n\nThe above decomposition and combinatorial structure is, of course, similar to\nthe Weyl chamber decomposition for the Weyl group An\u22121 = Sn of SU (n).\nBy (140) and (141), the expression (150) may be written\nX mi mj\n(153)\nU (x) =\n|\u03c9 ij (x)|\ni<j\n\nwhich in the fundamental chamber reads\nX mi mj\nU (x) =\n\u03c9 ij (x)\ni<j\n\nfor x \u2208 C0\n\nLemma 6.1 U (x) is a convex function on the chamber C0 , and it has a unique\ncritical point x0 (where U has a minimum) in the spherical chamber C0 \u2229 S n\u22122 .\nProof. By straightforward calculations\nk\nX\nwij\n\u2202U\n=\u2212\nmi mj\n\u2202xk\n\u03c9ij (x)2\ni<j\n\n\u22022U\n\n\u2202xk \u2202xl\n\n=2\n\nX\n\nmi mj\n\ni<j\n\nk wl\nwij\nij\n\u03c9 ij (x)3\n\n1 , w 2 , ..., w n\u22121 ) and x = (x , x , , , x\nwhere wij = (wij\n1 2\nn\u22121 ). Hence, the Hessian\nij\nij\nof U at x \u2208 C0 is the following positive definite quadratic form in the variable\nt = (t1 , t2 , ..., tn\u22121 )\n\nHU (x)(t) =\n\nn\u22121\nX\n\u03c9 ij (t)2\n1 X \u22022U\n(x)tk tl =\nmi mj\n2\n\u2202xk \u2202xl\n\u03c9 ij (x)3\ni<j\n\nk,l=1\n\nOn the other hand, U (x) > 0 on C0 and U (x) \u2192 \u221e as x approaches the\nwalls of the chamber and is bounded away from the origin. It follows that U\n54\n\n\fhas a unique critical point in the spherical chamber, namely a minimumspoint\nx0 .\nThe induced congruence group action on Rn\u22121 is simply the group O(1) =\n{\u00b11} acting by inversion x \u2192 \u2212x, and therefore antipodal points on the sphere\nS n\u22122 represent collinear n-configurations with the same shape :\nS n\u22122 \u2192 S n\u22122 /O(1) = RP n\u22122 \u2282 Mn\u2217\n\n(154)\n\nIn particular, a pairs of antipodal chambers is mapped to the same chamber in\nRP n\u22122 , and consequently the latter space is divided into n!/2 chambers, each\ncontaining a unique critical point of U as a function on RP n\u22122 . This completes\nthe proof of the enumeration result originally due to Moulton.\nRemark 6.2 The above central configuration solutions (a1, a2 , ..., an ) can be\ndistinguished by the ordering ai1 > ai2 > .... > ain (modulo inversion of order),\nand the minimumspoint x0 in the fundamental chamber C0 is the solution with\nthe ordering (152). However, for a given mass distribution (m1 , m2 , ..., mn ) the\nsolution satisfying ai1 > ai2 > .... > ain can also be found by the same procedure,\nnamely as the minimumspoint x0 in the fundamental chamber C0 corresponding\nto the permuted mass distribution (mi1 , mi2 , ..., min ). In particular, for each\nstring of equal masses mi = mj = .. = mk the set of solutions is invariant\nunder permutations of ai , aj , .., ak .\nLet us briefly consider the explicit numerical calculation of the collinear\ncentral configurations by calculating the critical points of U on S n\u22122 . Observe\nthat the identity (151) with the additional condition I = 1 may be interpreted\nas an application of the classical Lagrange multiplier method with a constraint.\nSimilarly, in the present case where we restrict to collinear configurations, we\nseek the n! solutions of the system\n\u2207U (x) = \u03bbx , |x| = 1\n\n(155)\n\nwhere \u03bb = \u2212U (x) (by Euler's formula) and\n\u2207U (x) = \u2212\n\nX\ni<j\n\nmi mj\n\nwij\n\u03c9 ij (x)2\n\nThe condition for a solution is the vanishing of the component of the gradient\ntangential to the sphere, namely\n\u2207U (x) + U (x)x = 0\n\n(156)\n\nAs a simpleminded algorithm for finding a solution we construct a sequence of\npoints yk \u2208 S n\u22122 by \"moving\" on the sphere in the direction opposite to the\nvector (156), as follows\nyk+1 =\n\n(1 \u2212 U (yk ))yk \u2212 \u2207U (yk )\n,\n|(1 \u2212 U (yk ))yk \u2212 \u2207U (yk )|\n55\n\n\fstarting from an initial point y1 in a given chamber. In general, the sequence\nwill stay in the chamber and converge to the minimumspoint of U. The algorithm\ncan certainly be made more effictive, but we shall not discuss these matters.\nAnother approach is to introduce new variables ti linearly related to x1 , x2 , ., xn\u22121\nvia the simple roots.\nti = \u03c9 i,i+1 (x) = ai \u2212 ai+1 , i = 1, 2, ..., n \u2212 1\nFor example, in the case n = 3 the system (155) reads\nm1\n1 \u2212 m1\nm1\n+\n+\n\u2212 \u03bbt2\n2\n2\n(t1 )\n(t2 )\n(t1 + t2 )2\nm3\nm2\n+\n\u2212 \u03bb[(1 \u2212 m1 )t1 + m3 t2 ]\n0=\n2\n(t1 )\n(t1 + t2 )2\n\n0=\u2212\n\n(157)\n\nas compared to the initial system (151) which has three dependent equations\nsimilar to the above ones. In fact, the first equation of system (151) and (157)\nare identical. By elimination of \u03bb we obtain a homogeneous equation of degree\n5 which has a unique solution (modulo scaling) with both ti > 0. Thus it can be\nreduced to an inhomogeneous equation of degree 4, whereas Euler's approach\nled to the solution of a 5th order inhomogeneous equation P (\u03c9) = 0 (cf.[25],\n\u00a714). The latter equation is, in fact, obtained from the system (157) when we\nwrite (t1 + t2 ) = t, t1 = \u03c9t, t2 = (1 \u2212 \u03c9)t and eliminate the resulting multiplier\n\u03bb\u2032 = \u03bbt3 .\n\nReferences\n[1] M.
