Aria and Morteza Gharib\nGraduate Aeronautical Laboratories,\nCalifornia Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA 91125, USA\nNovember 7, 2018\n\nAbstract\nOver the past few decades, superhydrophobic materials have attaracted a lot of interests, due to their numerous practical applications.\nAmong various superhydrophobic materials, carbon nanotube arrays\nhave gained enormous attentions simply because of their outstanding\nproperties. The impact dynamics of water droplet on a superhydrophobic carbon nanotube array is shown in this fluid dynamics video.\n\n1\n\nVideo description\n\nThe first two parts of the video show the impact dynamic of 30 \u03bcl water\ndroplet at different impact velocity. At low impact velocity of 1.03 m/s, the\nwater droplet deforms upon impact and eventually bounces off completely of\nthe surface of the array. At higher impact velocity of 2.21 m/s, the droplet\nbreaks up into many smaller droplets and eventually bounces off completely\nof the surface of the array.\nThe coefficient of restitution of water droplet at very low impact velocity\ncan be seen clearly by dropping a water droplet on a slightly tilted carbon\nnanotube array. At tilt angle of 2.5 \u25e6 the droplet skips off of the surface of\nthe array multiple times without showing any sign of pinning on the surface\nof the array, as demonstrated in the third part of the video. The fourth\npart of the video shows the sliding/rolling behavior of the droplet along the\nsurface of a U-shaped carbon nanotube array. The fifth part of the video\nshows the impact of two identical 14 \u03bcl water droplets to one another on a\n\n1\n\n\fU-shaped carbon nanotube arrays. Upon impact, these two water droplets,\nwhich come from the opposite direction, merge to form one larger droplet.\nAll parts of the video were captured by high speed camera operated at\nvarious frame rates. The droplet was illuminated from behind with a diffuse\nhalogen light. The droplet was dropped on the surface by flat-tipped needle\nand the volume of the droplet was controlled precisely by syringe pump.\nThis work was supported by The Charyk Foundation and The Fletcher\nJones Foundation.\n\n2\n\n\f"}
