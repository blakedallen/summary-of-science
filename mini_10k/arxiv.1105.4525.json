An exactly\nsolvable example of the so called Gegenbauerian quantum-lattice oscillator\nis recalled for the purpose. Both the construction of suitable \u0398 = \u0398(H)\n(basically, the solution of the Dieudonne's operator equation) and the determination of its domain of positivity are shown facilitated by the symbolic\nalgebraic manipulations and by MAPLE-supported numerics and graphics.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn the series of papers [1] - [7] we interpreted the Dieudonn\u00e9's quasi-Hermiticity\nrelation [8]\nH\u2020 \u0398 = \u0398 H\n(1)\nas an operator equation which connects a given, \"input\" quantum Hamiltonian H with an unknown, \"output\" operator \u0398 called the Hilbert-space\nmetric of the quantum system in question ([9]; cf. also a more detailed explanation of the underlying physics in Appendix A below).\nIn all of our papers we felt addressed by the underlying physics (i.e., by\nquantum mechanics in its form described, say, in Refs. [10, 11]) and did not\npay too much attention to the underlying constructive mathematics. In our\npresent paper we intend to fill this gap by redirecting our attention to the\ncomputer-assisted symbolic-manipulation background of our results.\nWe shall assume that both of the operators H and \u0398 in Eq. (1) are defined\nin a vector space V with the Dirac-ket elements |\u03c8i \u2208 V. For the sake of\nsimplicity we shall further assume that dim V = N < \u221e. In such a setting\none may select various toy-model matrices H (N ) and construct the eligible\nmetrics \u0398. For such a purpose we shall choose the Gegenbauerian quantum\n1\nWork supported by the GA\u010cR grant Nr. P203/11/1433, by the M\u0160MT \"Doppler\nInstitute\" project Nr. LC06002 and by the Inst.

[2] (cf.\nsection 2). The reasons of a facilitated algebraic tractability of Eq. (1) will\nbe then clarified in section 3, with some complementary numerical aspects\nmentioned in section 4.\n\n2\n\nGegenbauerian quantum N \u2212site lattices\n\nThe general Hermitian conjugation prescribed by Eq. (15) of Appendix A\nmust be compatible with the principles of Quantum Mechanics. This means\nthat, formally speaking [11], our choice of the metric \u0398 must guarantee the\nHermiticity of the observables (i.e., in our present paper, just of the Hamiltonian H) with respect to this conjugation [9]. Such a requirement implies\nthe necessity of the validity of the above-mentioned relation (1).\nThe latter relation will be called here, for the sake of brevity, Dieudonn\u00e9\nequation. As long as this is the matrix equation, it seems to be an overdeterminate constraint. Its N 2 items have to be satisfied by the mere N(N + 1)/2\nindependent matrix elements of the general N by N real and symmetric\nmatrix \u0398 with positive eigenvalues. Via a deeper study of an illustrative\nexample taken from Ref. [2] we intend to demonstrate that the situation is\nmuch more user friendly.\nFirst of all, the Hermitian conjugation may be perceived as a symmetry\nof Eq. (1) so that just its upper-triangular nontrivial subset remains relevant.\nThis implies that the whole set of equations is in fact underdeterminate. A\npriori, the independent solutions \u0398 will form an N\u2212parametric family. This\nobservation is compatible with the explicit constructive results published in\nRef. [2].\nSecondly, the message delivered by Ref. [2] was aimed at the physics\naudience. Our present study will complement these results by their more\nsystematic derivation and by the more explicit explanation of their formal\nstructure. Keeping this aim in mind we shall consider the N\u2212dimensional\nmatrix Schr\u00f6dinger equation\nH (N ) |\u03c8n(N ) i = En(N ) |\u03c8n(N ) i\nwith the prescribed bound-state eigenvectors\n\uf8eb\n(N )\nh0|\u03c8n i = G(0, a, En )\n(N )\n\uf8ec\nh1|\u03c8n i = G(1, a, En )\n\uf8ec\n(N )\n|\u03c8n i = \uf8ec\n..\n\uf8ed\n.\n(N )\n\nhN \u2212 1|\u03c8n i = G(N \u2212 1, a, En )\n\n(2)\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n(3)\n\nwhere, in the notation of MAPLE [12], the symbol G(n, a, x) denotes the\nn\u2212th Gegenbauer polynomial G(n, a, x) equal to polynomial Cna (x) in the\n(a)\nnotation of Ref. [13] or to Cn (x) according to Ref. [14]. Under such an\nassumption, naturally, the explicit form of the related Hamiltonian is the\n\n2\n\n\ftridiagonal array\n\uf8ee\n0\n1/2 a\u22121\n0\n0\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef 2 a\n0\n(2 a + 2)\u22121\n0\n\uf8ef 2 a+2\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n2 a+1\n\uf8ef 0\n0\n(2 a + 4)\u22121\n2 a+4\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n..\n2 a+2\n.\n\uf8ef 0\n0\n2 a+6\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n..\n..\n..\n..\n\uf8ef\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\uf8f0\n0\n...\n0\n0\n\n...\n...\n\n0\n..\n.\n\n..\n\n.\n\n0\n\n..\n\n.\n\n0\n\n0\n\n(2 a + 2N \u2212 4)\u22121\n\n2 a+N \u22121\n2 a+2N \u22122\n\n0\n\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fb\n\n(4)\nwhich defines the manifestly asymmetric N by N matrix H (N ) .\nThe validity of such an assignment is equivalent to the standard threeterm recurrences for the Gegenbauer polynomials while the N by N matrix\ntruncation is equivalent to the implicit-equation identification of the real and\nnon-degenerate spectrum \u03c3(H (N ) ) \u2261 {En } of the bound-state energies with\nthe roots of the N\u2212th Gegenbauer polynomial,\nG(N, a, En ) = 0 .\n\n(5)\n\nNaturally, such a secular equation may be considered solvable with an arbitrary numerical precision. The only nontrivial task represented by the\ncomplete description of the model will lie in the choice of a metric \u0398 compatible with Dieudonn\u00e9 Eq. (1). The method has not been described in\nRef. [2] because it just consisted in the brute-force insertion of a general real\nand symmetric ansatz for \u0398(N ) and in the subsequent trial and error analysis\nof Eq. (1) after its insertion.\nIn the metric-construction problem the key difficulties are twofold. Firstly,\nthe ansatz for \u0398(N ) contains too many (i.e., N(N +1)/2) unknowns and there\nare no criteria for the clarification which ones of them should be selected as\nthe \"optimal\" independent set. Even at the very small integers N, preliminary MAPLE-based brute-force algebraic symbolic-manipulation-solution experiments starting from Eq. (1) and from a few randomly selected N\u2212plets\nof the tentative independent matrix elements of \u0398 generated just the obscure\nmany-page results for all of the N\u2212 and a\u2212dependent matrix elements of\n\u0398(H). The second difficulty emerged with the necessity of the parameterrange-specifying guarantee of the obligatorily positive-definite nature of any\nresulting N by N matrix candidate \u0398\u03b1 (H) for the metric (characterized or\ndistinguished, in general, by a suitable multiindex \u03b1).\nThe core of the success (i.e., of the resolution to both of these parallel\nalgebro-numerical difficulties) has been revealed to lie in an interactive and\niterative approach to both of the problems. In more detail this approach is\nto be described in what follows.\n\n3\n\nThe Dieudonn\u00e9's equation\n\nIn the light of the old Dieudonn\u00e9's idea [8] it seems interesting to replace\nthe current textbook Hermiticity property H = H \u2020 of the current selfadjoint\n3\n\n\fHamiltonians in quantum mechanics by the weaker assumption containing\na nontrivial \"metric\" \u0398 6= I [9]. In this context relation (1) guarantees the\nreality of the energies provided only that we require that the operator \u0398 = \u0398\u2020\nis, roughly speaking [15], positive and invertible, i.e., tractable as a metric\nin the Hilbert space of states H(S) where the superscript means \"standard\".\nThe recent growth of popularity and applicability of the quantum models\nrequiring the unusual metrics \u0398 = \u0398(S) > I may be found reviewed, e.g.,\nin Refs. [10, 16, 17]. In our present paper we circumvent a number of technicalities by studying just the quantum models defined in finite-dimensional\nHilbert spaces. Thus, we may identify H(F ) \u2261 CN . Moreover, for the sake of\ndefiniteness, we shall only pay attention to the models where the Hamiltonian\nmatrices possess the tridiagonal real-matrix form.\n\n3.1\n\nAn interactive algebraic-solution technique\n\nAs an illustrative example we shall use the Gegenbauerian quantum lattice\nmodel of Ref. [2] described in the preceding section. In fact, in Ref. [2] we\ndescribed the results showing the feasibility of the brute-force construction of\nthe complete family of the metrics \u0398(H) admitted by the Dieudonn\u00e9's linear\nalgebraic constraints (1). In our present continuation of this effort we intend\nto provide a deeper insight in the problem explaining the reasons why our\nconstruction of the metrics appeared to be so successful.\nWe have to admit that with our very specific choice of the Gegenbauerian\nmodel in Ref. [2] we were unexpectedly fortunate. This fact may be demonstrated, say, by the recollection of the similar constructive attempts based on\na different choice of the N by N \"input\" Hamiltonian as reported in Ref. [4].\nAfter the construction of \u0398(H) at the dimension as low as N = 4 it has\nbeen argued there that the construction at the very next N = 5 appeared\nalmost prohibitively complicated. This is really in contrast with the results\nof Ref. [2] which proved valid at any integer N.\nThe core of the dimension-independent universality of the above-mentioned\nGegenbauerian result may be seen in the combination of the extremely simple bidiagonal form of the Hamiltonians H (N ) (a) with the comparably simple\na\u2212dependence of its matrix elements. The relevance of both of these ingredients becomes obvious when we recall the explicit N = 4 sample of the\nHamiltonian\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n0\n(2 a)\u22121\n0\n0\n\uf8ef 2a\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n0\n(2 a + 2)\u22121\n0\n2\na+2\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n(4)\nH (a) = \uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\u22121\n2\na+1\n\uf8ef 0\n\uf8fa\n0\n(2\na\n+\n4)\n2 a+4\n\uf8f0\n\uf8fb\n0\n\n2 a+2\n2 a+6\n\n0\n\n0\n\ntogether with the general ansatz for the metric\n\uf8ee\nk b c d\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef b f g h\n\u0398(4) (a) = \uf8ef\n\uf8ef c g m n\n\uf8f0\nd h n\n4\n\nj\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa.\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fb\n\n\fIn such a setting we may study the 16-plet of the resulting relations, out\nof which Nr. 1, Nr. 6, Nr. 11 and Nr. 16 (i.e., diagonal items) remain\ntrivial while the off-diagonal items form an antisymmetric matrix. Out of\nthe remaining six independent items (say, Nr. 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, and 12) there\nis just one (viz., Nr. 4) which involves just two unknown quantities (viz.,\nh and c). This leads to the decision of taking d, c, b and k as independent\nparameters and of eliminating, in the first step, h via item Nr. 4,\nh=\n\nc (a + 1)\n.\n2 (a + 2) a\n\nThe inspection of the new set of items reveals that the simplest one is now\njust Nr. 3 which defines g as a function of b and d, with the next-step Nr. 8\ndefining n as a function of d and (newly known) g. We are left with the three\nitems Nr. 2, 7 and 12 which couple (k, f ), (f, m) and (m, j), respectively.\nAs long as we decided to use k as the fourth unconstrained parameter this\nmeans that in the same order we now define, step by step, the missing items\nf , m and, ultimately, j.

Once we revealed the diagonal-wise-arranged recurrent pattern it is\neasy and entirely straightforward to verify its validity by the corresponding\ntrivial rearrangement of the two matrix multiplications in Eq. (1).\nRemark 1. The diagonal-wise recurrent nature of Eq. (1) given by Theorem\n1 has only been revealed by the post factum inspection of the results of\nRef. [2].\n\n4\n\nThe positive definiteness of the metric\n\nDuring the recent years we are witnessing the remarkable growth of popularity of the building of quantum models which combine the \"false\" nonHermiticity H 6= H \u2020 of the comparatively elementary Hamiltonian acting in\na \"friendly\" Hilbert space H(F ) with the simultaneous \"sophisticated\" Hermiticity H = H \u2021 of the same Hamiltonian in another, less usual, amended,\n\"standard\" Hilbert space H(S) endowed with a nontrivial metric \u0398 = \u0398(S) 6=\nI. The essence of such an innovation becomes entirely transparent and obvious when one eliminates the partial confusion caused by the traditional\nterminology. The key point is that one never leaves the abstract theoretical\nframework of quantum theory. Just a few new mathematical tricks (like, typically, an unusual, non-unitary generalization of the most common Fourier\ntransformation) are being added to the traditional textbook recipes.\n\n4.1\n\nThe formulation of quantum theory using an ad\nhoc triplet of complementary Hilbert spaces\n\nThe Dieudonn\u00e9-equation constraint imposed on a Hamiltonian H is in fact\nequivalent to the manifest Hermiticity of its isospectral image\nh = \u03a9 H \u03a9\u22121 = h\u2020\n6\n\n(9)\n\n\f[11]. In principle (though not always in practice) the latter operator is defined\nas acting in the physical Hilbert space H(P ) in which the traditional, trivial\nmetric \u0398(P ) = I is being used.\nBoth the Hilbert spaces H(P ) and H(S) may be perceived as unitary equivalent. We may deduce\n\u0001\u2020\nh\u2020 = \u03a9\u22121 H \u2020 \u03a9\u2020 .\n(10)\n\nAfter we abbreviate \u03a9\u2020 \u03a9 := \u0398 we end up with the Dieudonn\u00e9's relation (1).\n\n4.2\n\nThe Gegenbauerian illustrative example\n\nFor our real and finite-dimensional Gegenbauerian Hamiltonians H = H (N ) (a)\nwhich are given in advance, the Dieudonn\u00e9's relation (1) forms the set of N 2\nconstraints imposed upon the [N(N + 1)/2]\u2212plet of the unknown real matrix\nelements of the metric matrix \u0398 = \u0398\u2020 > 0. In papers [1] - [7] we proposed\nthe non-numerical, symbolic-manipulation approach to constructions of a\ncomplete solution of this linear algebraic system. What remains for us to\nconstruct is the appropriate domain D of free parameters for which these\ncandidates for the metric remain positive definite, i.e., truly eligible in the\nappropriate definitions of the generalized Hermitian conjugation and/or of\nthe appropriate Hilbert-space inner product.\nIn Ref. [2] we discussed a few specific examples of candidates \u0398(N ) (a) for\nthe Gegenbauerian metrics. We revealed that such a study leads to a purely\nnumerical description supporting the hypothesis that the domains D (N ) (a)\nchange \"smoothly\" with N and lead to the non-empty and sufficiently large\nlimiting domains limN \u2192\u221e D (N ) (a) = D (\u221e) (a) 6= \u2205.\nA comparatively weak N\u2212dependence characterizes even the domains\n(N )\nD (a) at small N ' 5. The direct evaluation of the eigenvalues of \u0398(N ) (a)\n(i.e., the more precise determination of the boundaries \u2202D (N ) (a)) only suffers\nof the errors caused by the multiple-scale nature of these eigenvalues.\nIn Ref. [2] we were only able to provide a transparent graphical illustration\nof the free-parameter-dependence of the spectrum of selected \u0398(N ) (a)s at\nthe very first nontrivial dimension N = 3. In the context of programming\nin MAPLE (offering an adaptable floating-point precision arithmetics) the\nremedy is easy. One may take, say, the N = 3 toy metric of Ref. [2],\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n2 a2 2 ga\n0\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef 2 ga a + 1\n\uf8fa\ng\n\u0398(3)\n(a)\n=\ng\n\uf8f0\n\uf8fb\na+2\n0\ng\n2 a+1\nand represent the triplet of eigenvalues pj (g), j = 1, 2, 3 (as sampled in Figure\nNr. 3 of loc. cit. at a = 1) in logarithmic scale yielding, say, the adapted\na = 1 secular equation\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\n2 \u2212 e\u2212ttr \u221220\n2g\n0\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\u2212ttr \u221220\n\uf8fa=0\n2\ng\n2\n\u2212\ne\ng\ndet \uf8ef\n\uf8fb\n\uf8f0\n\u2212ttr \u221220\n0\ng\n1\u2212e\ni.e., the non-polynomial version of our eigenvalue problem,\n\u00012\n\u00013\n4 \u2212 8 e\u2212ttr\u221220 + 5 e\u2212ttr\u221220 \u2212 6 g 2 \u2212 e\u2212ttr \u221220 + 5 g 2e\u2212ttr \u221220 = 0 .\n7\n\n\fIn a test run the numerical analysis of this equation reproduced the results\ngiven in Table Nr. 1 of loc. cit..\nOn this basis one may expect that the key problem brought by the rescaling appears tractable by the MAPLE-based numerical software. The main\ngain came with the substantial extension of the feasibility of the graphical\n(N )\ndeterminations of the parameter-dependence of the physical domains Dg (a)\nwith the growth of N.

(1) is ambiguous [9]. In this context, our series of papers [1] [7] has been devoted to the constructive study of the one-to-many mappings\nH \u2192 \u0398(H). In essence, we offered there a new methodical recipe of a\nsystematic suppression of the ambiguity of the menu of eligible \u0398(H)s.\nIn our present continuation and extension of this paper we decided to\nexplain the symbolic-manipulation aspects of such a recipe in more detail.\nEmphasizing that such a problem would be hardly tractable and/or solvable\n8\n\n\fwithout an essential interaction between the abstract quantum theory and\nthe symbolic-manipulation techniques and algebraic constructionis assisted\nby contemporary computers.\nOne of byproducts of such an interaction between methods has been\nshown to lie in the possible amendments of the numerical aspects of the\nnecessary simultaneous analysis and study of physical domains and of the\nother properties of both of the physics-representing operators H and \u0398. On\nthe basis of these results one can conclude that the confirmation of feasibility\nof a methodical symbiosis between algebra and analysis seems to be able to\ncontribute to the contemporary quick growth of popularity of the practical\nphenomenological applications of quantum models with nontrivial metrics,\ne.g., in optics [18].\n\nAppendix A. A compact review of Quantum\nMechanics using nontrivial metrics \u0398 6= I\nIn the spirit of certain textbooks on Quantum Mechanics [19] the Dirac's ket\nvectors |\u03c8i \u2208 V may be interpreted as describing different quantum systems\nthe nature of which may vary with the other characteristics of the system\nin question. Thus, one can start from the most common single-particle (or,\nin some applications, single quasi-particle) quantum models where, roughly\nspeaking, there exists an operator Q\u0302 of the particle position with eigenvalues\nq \u2208 R and eigenkets |qi. One then introduces the standard (often called\nDirac's) Hermitian conjugation (i.e., transposition plus complex conjugation)\nT (Dirac) : |\u03c8i \u2192 h\u03c8| .\n\n(11)\n\nIn this manner one represents the kets of states |\u03c8i by the concrete squareintegrable functions \u03c8(q) = hq|\u03c8i (of the coordinate q) called wave functions.\nIn this context the discrete, finite-dimensional models exemplified by Eq. (3)\nmay be perceived as the most convenient testing ground of the methods.\nIn all of the similar classes of examples the vector space of states V becomes endowed with the most common inner product\nZ \u221e\nh\u03c8a |\u03c8b i =\n\u03c8a\u2217 (q)\u03c8b (q) dq\n(12)\n\u2212\u221e\n\nwith, possibly, the integration replaced by the infinite or finite summation.\nThus, we may (and usually do) set V \u2261 L2 (R), etc.\nWithout any real danger of misunderstanding we may speak here about\nthe \"friendly\" Hilbert space of states H(F ) \u2261 V, calling the variable q in\nEq. (12) \"the coordinate\". In parallel we usually perform a maximally convenient choice of the Hamiltonian H based on the so called principle of correspondence which \"dictates\" us to split H = T + V where the general interaction operator V is represented, say, by a kernel V (q, q \u2032 ) when acting upon the\nwave functions. In practice, this kernel is most often chosen as proportional\nto the Dirac's delta-function so that V becomes an elementary multiplicative\noperator V = Vlocal = V (q). Similarly, the most popular and preferred form\nof the \"kinetic energy\" T is a differential operator, say, T = Tlocal = \u2212d2 /dq 2\nin single dimension and suitable units.\n9\n\n\fA word of warning emerges when we perform a Fourier transformation\nin H(F ) so that the variable q becomes replaced by p (= momentum). One\nshould rather denote the latter, \"Fourier-image\" space by the slightly different symbol H(P ) , therefore (with the superscript still abbreviating \"physical\"\n[11]). Paradoxically, after this change of frame the kinetic operator Tlocal becomes multiplicative while Vlocal becomes strongly non-local in momenta.\nThe truly deep change of the paradigm comes with the models where the\nnecessity of the observability of the coordinate q is abandoned completely.\nOne may still start from the vector space of kets V and endow it with the\nHilbert-space structure via the similarly looking inner product\nZ\nh\u03c8a |\u03c8b i =\n\u03c8a\u2217 (s)\u03c8b (s) ds .\n(13)\nC\n\nThe non-existence of the position operator Q\u0302 changes the physics of course.\nThe key point is that we lose the one-to-one correspondence between the\nintegration path C and the spectrum R of any coordinate-mimicking operator.\nThe physics-independent optional variable s remains purely formal.\nIn such a setting our choice of the physical observables remains unrestricted and is entirely arbitrary. It need not be related to any usual classical\nsystem, either. For illustration one might recall the pedagogically motivated\npaper [20]. In a slightly provocative demonstration of the abstract nature\nof quantum theory the variable s in Eq. (13) has been chosen there as an\nobservable \"time\" of a hypothetical \"quantum clock\" system.\nDefinition (13) of the inner product in H(F ) or in H(P ) is the theoretical\nframework within which the traditional quantum mechanics works, reducing\nthe full power of the theory to something acceptable via analogies with classical physics. Still, one need not move too far. Even in Ref. [1], for example,\nwe did not treat the variable s in Eq. (13) as a purely formal quantity, having\npreserved at least a part of its relation to the position q. In particular, we\nstayed in the middle of the path towards abstraction and worked still with\nthe usual one-dimensional ordinary differential Schr\u00f6dinger equation\n\u2212\n\nd2\n\u03c8n (s) + V (s) \u03c8n (s) = En \u03c8n (s) ,\nds2\n\nn = 0, 1, . . .\n\n(14)\n\nwhere the key nonstandard features can be seen in\n\u2022 the admissibility of the complex potentials sampled by the power-lawanharmonic family V (s) = \u2212(is)2+\u03b4 of Ref. [21] giving the \"standard\"\nreal and discrete bound-state spectra at any \u03b4 > 0 (cf. the proofs in\n[22]);\n\u2022 the admissibility of the replacement of the usual real line of s by a\nsuitable complex curve C = C(R) which may even be, in principle,\nliving on a complicated multisheeted Riemann surface [23];\n\u2022 in the possibility of a systematic study of its discrete analogues and\nsimplifications.\nNaturally, one partially leaves the more or less safe guidance offered by the\nprinciple of correspondence. Just a partial revitalization of this guidance is\n10\n\n\fpossible (cf., e.g., a nice example-based discussion of this point in Ref. [24]).\nA partial reward for this loss can be sought in a new tractability of some\ntraditionally contradictory quantization problems (say, when working, say,\nwith the relativistic Klein-Gordon equations [25]).\nThe main theoretical difficulty consists in the vast ambiguity of the necessary appropriate generalization of Eq. (11). The general recipe (explained\nalready in [9] or, more explicitly, in [11]) is metric-dependent and reads\n(general)\n\nT\u0398\n\n: |\u03c8i \u2192 hh\u03c8| := h\u03c8|\u0398 .\n\n(15)\n\nThis means that using the language of wave functions \u03c8(s) with s \u2208 C we\nmust replace the most common single-integral definition (13) of the inner\nproduct in the original \"friendly\" Hilbert space H(F ) by the more sophisticated double-integral formula\nZ Z\nhh\u03c8a |\u03c8b i =\n\u03c8a\u2217 (s) \u0398(s, s\u2032 ) \u03c8b (s\u2032 ) ds ds\u2032 .\n(16)\nC\n\nC\n\nIn terms of an integral-operator-kernel representation \u0398(s, s\u2032 ) of our abstract\nmetric operator \u0398 = \u0398\u2020 > 0 this recipe defines a more sophisticated inner\nproduct which converts the ket-vector space V into the metric-dependent\n(and physics-representing, \"standard\" [11]) Hilbert space H(S) .\n\nReferences\n[1] M.
