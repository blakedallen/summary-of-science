Ornea and M. Verbitsky, June 13, 2006\n\nIntroduction\nCalabi-Yau theorem and Monge-Amp\u00e8re equations\n\nS.-T. Yau [Y] has shown that a compact manifold of K\u00e4hler type with vanishing first Chern class admits a unique K\u00e4hler-Einstein metric in a given\nK\u00e4hler class. This result is known as Calabi-Yau theorem; see [B] for details\nand implications of this extremely important work. Such a metric is called\nnow Calabi-Yau metric. This theorem was conjectured by E. Calabi ([C]),\nwho also proved that Calabi-Yau metric is unique, in a a given K\u00e4hler class.\nThe idea of the proof was suggested by Calabi, who has shown that\nexistence of Calabi-Yau metric is implied by the following theorem, which\nis true for all compact K\u00e4hler manifolds.\nTheorem 1.1. ([Y]) Let M be a compact K\u00e4hler manifold, [\u03c9] \u2208 H 1,1 (M )\na K\u00e4hler class, and V \u2208 \u039bn,n (M ) a nowhere degenerate volume form. Then\nthere exists a unique K\u00e4hler form \u03c91 \u2208 [\u03c9], such that\n\u03c91n = \u03bbV,\n\n(1.1)\n\nwhere \u03bb is a constant.\n\nGiven two K\u00e4hler forms \u03c9, \u03c91 , in the same K\u00e4hler class, we can always\nhave\n\u03c91 = \u03c9 + ddc \u03c6\nfor some function \u03c6 (this statement is a consequence of the famous ddc lemma; see e.g. [GH]). Then (1.1) becomes\n(\u03c9 + ddc \u03c6)n = \u03bbef \u03c9 n .\n\n(1.2)\n\nHere the function \u03c6 is an unknown, the K\u00e4hler form \u03c9 and the function f\nare given, and the constant \u03bb is expressed through f and \u03c9 as\nZ\nZ\nn\nef \u03c9 n .\n\u03c9 =\u03bb\nM\n\nM\n\nThe equation (1.2) is called the complex Monge-Amp\u00e8re equation.\nSolutions of (1.1) are unique on a compact manifold, as shown by Calabi\n([C]).\n\n2\n\n\fEinstein-Weyl structures on Vaisman manifolds\n\n1.2\n\nL. Ornea and M. Verbitsky, June 13, 2006\n\nMonge-Amp\u00e8re equations on LCK-manifolds\n\nIn this note, we generalize the Monge-Amp\u00e8re equation to locally conformally K\u00e4hler geometry, and show that its solutions are unique.\nRecall that a locally conformally K\u00e4hler (LCK) manifold is a complex\nf, with the deck transform acting\nmanifold admitting a K\u00e4hler covering M\nf\nf is, in addition, Ricci-flat, M\non M by holomorphic homotheties. If M\nis called Hermitian Einstein-Weyl, or locally conformally K\u00e4hler EinsteinWeyl.1 The Hermitian Einstein-Weyl geometry is a conformal analogue of\nKa\u1e27ler-Einstein geometry.\nf conformally, the LCK-strucSince the deck transform group acts on M\nture defines a conformal class of Hermitian metrics on M . A metric in this\nclass is called an LCK-metric. In the literature, the distinction between\n\"LCK-metrics\" and \"LCK-structures\" is often ignored. Any compact LCKmanifold M is naturally equipped with a special Hermitian metric \u03c9 in its\nconformal class, called the Gauduchon metric (see Definition 2.5). It is\ndefined uniquely, up to a constant multiplier. If, in addition, \u03c9 is preserved\nf by homotheties, the LCK-manifold\nby a holomorphic flow, which acts on M\nM is called a Vaisman (this notion was first introduced as generalized\nHopf manifold, but the name proved to be inapropriate)2 . P. Gauduchon\nhas proven that all compact Hermitian Einstein-Weyl manifolds are Vaisman\n([G2]).\nGiven an LCK-manifold (M, I, \u03c9), its Hermitian form \u03c9 satisfies d\u03c9 =\n\u03c9 \u2227 \u03b8, where \u03b8 is a closed 1-form, called the Lee form of M (see Section\n2). Its cohomology class [\u03b8] is called the Lee class of M .\nThe Monge-Amp\u00e8re equations on LCK-manifolds are equivalent to finding a Gauduchon metric with a prescribed volume. Uniqueness of such\nmetric (hence, uniqueness of solutions of locally conformally K\u00e4hler MongeAmp\u00e8re) is due to the following theorem.\nTheorem 1.2. Let (M, J) be a compact complex manifold admitting a\nVaisman structure, and V \u2208 \u039bn,n (M ) a nowhere degenerate, positive volume\nform. Then M admits at most one Vaisman structure with the same Lee\nclass, such that the volume form of the corresponding Gauduchon metric is\nequal to V .\n1\n\nNormally, one defines Hermitian Einstein-Weyl differently, and then this definition\nbecomes a theorem; see Claim 4.2.\n2\nTraditionally, Vaisman manifolds are defined differently, and this definition becomes\na theorem; see Remark 2.9.\n\n3\n\n\fEinstein-Weyl structures on Vaisman manifolds\n\nL. Ornea and M. Verbitsky, June 13, 2006\n\nWe give an introduction to LCK-geometry in Section 2, and explain the\nproperties of Einstein-Weyl structures in Section 4. We prove Theorem 1.2\nin Section 3. The existence result (not proven in this paper) should follow\nfrom the same arguments, added to those used for the proof of Calabi-Yau\ntheorem. In the last section, we explain how other results oh K\u00e4hler geometry (the Calabi conjecture and the Bando-Mabuchi theorem) generalize to\nconformal setting.\nRemark 1.3. For a K\u00e4hler manifold, the metric is uniquely determined by\nthe volume form and the K\u00e4hler class in cohomology. In a conformal setting,\nthe Vaisman metric is defined uniquely by the volume and the Lee class. This\nhappens because a relevant cohomology group is H 2 (M, L), where L is the\nweight bundle of the conformal structure (see Definition 2.2). It is easy to\nshow that all cohomology of the local system L vanish, cf. [O, Remark 6.4].\n\n1.3\n\nSasaki-Einstein manifolds and Einstein-Weyl geometry\n\nThe compatibility between a complex structure and a Weyl structure naturally leads to the LCK-condition. This was observed by I. Vaisman (see also\n[PPS]). Moreover, as shown by P. Gauduchon ([G2]), a compact EinsteinWeyl locally conformally K\u00e4hler manifold is necessarily Vaisman (see Theorem 4.4).\nThen Theorem 1.2 is translated into the uniqueness of an Einstein-Weyl\nVaisman metric with a prescribed volume form and the Lee class.\nThe Vaisman manifolds are intimately related to Sasakian geometry (see\ne.g. [OV1]). Given a Sasakian manifold X, the product S 1 \u00d7X has a natural\nVaisman structure. Conversely, any Vaisman manifold admits a canonical\nRiemannian submersion to S 1 , with fibers which are isometric and equipped\nwith a natural Sasakian structure.\nUnder this correspondence, the Einstein-Weyl Vaisman manifolds correspond to Sasaki-Einstein manifolds. The Sasaki-Einstein manifolds recently\nbecame a focus of much research, due to a number of new and unexpected\nexamples constructed by string physicists (see [MSY], [CLPP], [GMSW1],\n[GMSW2], and the references therein). For a physicist, Sasaki-Einstein manifolds are interesting because of AdS/CFT correspondence in string theory.\nFrom the mathematical point of view, these examples are as mysterious as\nthe Mirror Symmetry conjecture 15 years ago.\nThe Sasakian manifolds, being transverse K\u00e4hler3 , can be studied by\nthe means of algebraic geometry. One might hope to obtain and study the\n3\n\nThis viewpoint was systematically developed in the work of C.P. Boyer, K. Galicki\nand collaborators. See e.g. [BG].\n\n4\n\n\fEinstein-Weyl structures on Vaisman manifolds\n\nL. Ornea and M. Verbitsky, June 13, 2006\n\nSasaki-Einstein metrics by the same kind of procedures as used to study\nthe K\u00e4hler-Einstein metrics in algebraic geometry. However, this analogy\nis not perfect. In particular, it is possible to show that the Sasaki-Einstein\nstructures on CR-manifolds are not unique.\nOne may hope to approach the classification of Sasaki-Einstein structures\nusing the Einstein-Weyl geometry.\n\n2\n\nVaisman manifolds and LCK-geometry\n\nWe first review the necessary notions of locally conformally K\u00e4hler geometry.\nSee [DO], [OV1], [OV2], [OV3], [Ve] for details and examples.\nLet (M, J, g) be a complex Hermitian manifold of complex dimension n.\nDenote by \u03c9 its fundamental two-form \u03c9(X, Y ) = g(X, JY ).\nDefinition 2.1. A Hermitian metric g on (M, J) is locally conformally\nK\u00e4hler (LCK for short) if\nd\u03c9 = \u03b8 \u2227 \u03c9,\nfor a closed 1-form \u03b8.\nClearly, for any smooth function f : M \u2212\u2192 R>0 , f \u03c9 is also an LCKmetric. A conformal class of LCK-metrics is called an LCK-structure.\nThe form \u03b8 is called the Lee form of the LCK-metric, and the dual\nvector field \u03b8 \u266f is called the Lee field.\nThe one-form 12 \u03b8 can be interpreted as a (flat) connection one-form in\nthe bundle of densities of weight 1, usually denoted L. This is the real line\nbundle associated to the representation\n1\n\nA 7\u2192| det(A) | 2n , A \u2208 GL(2n, R)\nDefinition 2.2. The bundle L, equipped with a connection \u22070 + \u03b8, is called\nthe weight bundle of a locally conformally K\u00e4hler structure. One\ncould consider the form \u03c9 as a closed, positive (1, 1)-form, taking values in\nL2 .\nRemark 2.3. Passing to a covering, we may assume that the flat bundle L\nis trivial. Then \u03c9 can be considered as a closed, positive (1, 1)-form taking\nvalues in a trivial vector bundle, that is, a K\u00e4hler form. Therefore, any\n5\n\n\fEinstein-Weyl structures on Vaisman manifolds\n\nL. Ornea and M. Verbitsky, June 13, 2006\n\nf which is K\u00e4hler. The deck transform\nLCK-manifold admits a covering M\nf\nacts on M by homotheties. This property can be used as a definition of\nLCK-structures (see Section 1).\nDefinition 2.4. A Vaisman manifold is an LCK-manifold equipped with\nan LCK-metric g whose Lee form is parallel with respect to the Levi-Civita\nconnection of g. In this case, g is called a Vaisman metric.\nA Vaisman metric on a compact manifold is unique, up to a constant\nmultiplier. The proof is due to P. Gauduchon ([G1]).\nDefinition 2.5. Let M be an LCK-manifold, g an LCK-metric, and \u03b8 the\ncorresponding Lee form. The metric g is called Gauduchon metric if\nd\u2217 \u03b8 = 0.\nTheorem 2.6. ([G1]) Let M be a compact LCK-manifold. Then M admits\na Gauduchon metric, which is unique, up to a constant multiplier.\n\nRemark 2.7. A Vaisman metric is obviously Gauduchon. Indeed, the Vaisman condition \u2207\u03b8 = 0 implies the Gauduchon condition d\u2217 \u03b8 = 0. Therefore,\nTheorem 2.6 implies the uniqueness of Vaisman metrics.\nDefinition 2.8. Let (C, g, \u03c9) be a K\u00e4hler manifold.

Hence the Vaisman manifolds provide\nexamples of transverse K\u00e4hler foliations ([Va], [Ts1]). Similarly, a Sasakian\nmanifold has a transverse K\u00e4hler geometry associated to the foliation generated by the Reeb field.\nA compact complex manifold of Vaisman type can have many Vaisman\nstructures, still the Lee field is unique up to homothety:\nProposition 2.14. If g1 , g2 are Vaisman metrics on the same compact\n\u266fg\n\u266fg\nmanifold (M, J), then \u03b81 1 = c\u03b82 2 , for some real constant c.\nProof: The result was proven by Tsukada in [Ts2]. Here we include an\nalternative proof. Recall from [Ve] that for a Vaisman structure (g, J), the\ntwo-form\n\u03b7 := \u03c9 \u2212 \u03b8 \u2227 J\u03b8\nis exact and positive, with the null-space generated by h\u03b8 \u266f , J\u03b8 \u266f i.

Let g1 , g2 be Vaisman metrics, \u03c91 , \u03c92 the corresponding Hermitian forms, \u03b8i and \u03b8i\u266f the corresponding Lee forms and Lee fields.

Here we use Remark 2.10: the orbits of\nJ\u03b81\u266f should be pre-compact. From (2.2) we obtain\nJ\u03b81\u266f = aJ\u03b82\u266f \u2212 b\u03b82\u266f .\nBut aJ\u03b82\u266f \u2212 b\u03b82\u266f acts on the metric by a homothety, with a coefficient which\nis proportional to e\u2212b .

Let LC = L \u2297R C be the complexification of the weight bundle of the Vaisman manifold (M, J, g). The Lee form then is the connection\nform of the standard Hermitian connection in LC , and one can prove (see\n[Ve]) that its curvature can be identified with the above form \u03b7 = \u03c9 \u2212 \u03b8 \u2227 J\u03b8,\nhence it is exact.\n\n3\n\nMonge-Amp\u00e8re equation on LCK-manifolds\n\nIn this Section, we prove Theorem 1.2.

As follows from the generalized maximum principle, a function in ker D which has a local maximum is necessarily constant.\nSince M is compact, any continuous function on M must have a maximum.\nTherefore, \u03c8 \u2208 ker D is constant, and \u03b71 \u2212 \u03b72 = ddc \u03c8 = 0. The proof of\nProposition 3.1 is finished.\nRemark 3.5. In this Section, we proved the uniqueness of a Vaisman metric\nsatisfying \u03c9 n = V , for a given non-degenerate, positive volume form V on\na given compact manifold admitting a Vaisman structure. Following the\nargument used to prove the Calabi-Yau theorem it seems to be possible to\nprove existence of such solutions as well. Indeed, \u03c9 n = V is equivalent to\n\u03b7 n\u22121 = (\u03b8 \u266f \u2227 J\u03b8 \u266f )\u230bV,\nand this is a transversal Calabi-Yau equation, which is implied by the same\narguments as used for the usual Calabi-Yau theorem.\nRemark 3.6. Assuming that Calabi-Yau-type result (as in Remark 3.5) is\ntrue in LCK geometry, we obtain a very simple description of the moduli of\nVaisman metrics. Indeed, the Vaisman metrics in this case are in one-to-one\ncorrespondence with non-degenerate, positive volume forms.\n\n4\n\nEinstein-Weyl LCK manifolds\n\nEinstein-Weyl structures are defined and studied for their own, see e.g. [CP].\nHere we specialize the definitions to LCK structures.\nThe Levi-Civita connection \u2207g of g is not the best tool to study the\nconformal properties of an LCK manifold.

An LCK-manifold is Einstein-Weyl if the symmetric part\nof the Ricci tensor of the Weyl connection is proportional to the metric. An\nEinstein-Weyl LCK-manifold is also called Hermitian Einstein-Weyl.\nLet \u2207 be a Weyl connection on an LCK-manifold. One can see that \u2207\nis the covariant derivative associated to the connection one-form \u03b8 in the\nf of M , with\nweight bundle L. Since \u03b8 is closed, we can take a covering M\nf\n\u03b8 = df , for some function f on M . The Weyl connection becomes the Levif.

Indeed, assume that M = Tot(K\\0)/hqi, where K\\0 is the space\nof non-zero vectors in the canonical line bundle of a Fano manifold X, and\nhqi a holomorphic Z-action generated by v \u2212\u2192 qv, where q is a fixed complex\nnumber, |q| > 1. The manifold M clearly admits a Vaisman structure; it is\nEinstein-Weyl if and only if X is K\u00e4hler-Einstein, and the K\u00e4hler-Einstein\nmetrics on X correspond uniquely to the Einstein-Weyl structures on M .\nTherefore, Conjecture 5.1 for such M is equivalent to the Bando-Mabuchi\ntheorem for X.\n\nAcknowledgements: This note originated from discussions at the Max\nPlanck Institute in Bonn whose support is gratefully acknowledged.
