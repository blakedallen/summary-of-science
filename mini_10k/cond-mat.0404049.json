increasing complexity, just as much as engineers and technologists\nhave been trying to miniaturize the devices they design for practical applications. It seems that these two directions have now come very close to a joining\npoint that happens to be located at the nanometer-scale. Accordingly, the name\n\"Nanoscience\" has been given to the resulting broad field of research. The rate\nat which laboratories and research groups are being converted to activities in\nnanoscience, may raise some fears that it will become a fashion-driven hype. On\nthe other hand, it is undeniable that nanoscience is in fact nothing else than the\nnatural evolution of last century's science, with a solid history of interests behind\nit. The subject of this thesis, that could be summarized as the quantum dynamics\nof magnetic molecules, is a good example of multidisciplinary topic that combines\nfundamental and practical aspects of the research at the nanometer scale.\nThe field of molecular magnetism has its roots in the interest of chemists towards the synthesis of large molecules, and the assembly of macroscopic amounts\nof them in regular structures. Along this route, it became clear that the synthesis\nof molecules having magnetic ions as constituents could give rise to structures\nwhere each molecule can be seen as a single-domain magnetic particle [1], often\ncalled \"cluster\", coordinated by a shell of organic ligands. Importantly, such\nmolecules are stoichiometric chemical compounds that can be packed in a crystalline structure, where the identical magnetic units interact only weakly with\neach other. In this way, each molecule can be treated in first approximation as a\nsingle nanometer-scale magnet, from where the name \"Single Molecule Magnet\"\n~ that arises from the combina(SMM), and is characterized by a large total spin S\ntion of the atomic electron spins. The possibility of combining magnetic ions and\norganic ligands in the most diverse ways allows to tune the physical properties of\nthese systems to obtain a wide range of magnetic behaviors.\nOne of the most essential physical properties of SMMs is their magnetic\nanisotropy, meaning that it may be energetically favorable for the magnetic moment of each molecule to align along a certain axis. At temperatures much lower\nthan the anisotropy energy(1) , the molecular spin is effectively \"frozen\" in a certain direction along the anisotropy axis, giving rise to single-molecule magnetic\n(1)\nThroughout this thesis we shall always express the energies in temperature units, i.e. divided\nby the Boltzmann constant kB .\n\n\f2\n\nIntroduction\n\nhysteresis [2]. This discovery in a molecular cluster containing a core of 12 manganese ions (Mn12 -ac) opened the perspective of using SMMs as the ultimate\nmagnetic memory units [3].\nAt the same time, people interested in the fundamental aspects of quantum\nmechanics at the macroscopic scale (the \"Schr\u00f6dinger cat\" problem [4]) realized\nthat SMMs could be candidates for the observation of quantum phenomena at\nthe macromolecular level, in particular quantum tunneling of the magnetic moment [5, 6]. This has been indeed recently achieved by observing regular steps\nin the magnetic hysteresis loops of Mn12 -ac [7, 8], which occur when spin states\non opposite sides of the anisotropy barrier have the same energy, so that the\ncluster spin may invert its direction by resonant quantum tunneling. Again, this\ndiscovery is important for both practical and fundamental reasons. On the one\nhand, it makes clear that a memory unit based on systems as small as a single\nmolecule would be useless if we cannot avoid the memory being self-erased by\nquantum tunneling. On the other hand, it suggests the possibility of using SMMs\nas a test ground for theories concerning the transition from quantum to classical\nphysics [9, 10], in particular as far as the role of the environment is concerned.\nOne of the great advantages of SMMs for fundamental research on quantum\nmechanics at the large scale is precisely that the influence of the environmental degrees of freedom on the giant molecular spin can be accurately calculated,\nthanks to the knowledge of the crystal structure and the magnetic couplings between the localized moments. Furthermore, the experimental investigations can\nprofit of all the best known techniques for solid-state physics. Since the pure\nquantum behavior in SMMs is typically achieved only in the subkelvin temperature range, this research requires the use of outstanding low-temperature facilities\nfor magnetic measurements. In chapter II we describe the working principles and\nthe guidelines for the design of several ultra-low temperature setups that are\nparticularly suitable for experiments on quantum magnetism.\nAs mentioned above, the magnetic properties of SMMs are determined in\nthe first place at the chemistry level, but an essential aspect is that it is also\npossible, given a certain SMM, to tune its quantum mechanical behavior \"in\nsitu\" by applying an external magnetic field. In particular, one can increase the\n~ by applying a field perpendicular to the anisotropy axis of\ntunneling rate of S\nthe molecule [11]. This can be pushed to such an extent that we may expect\nthe possibility to observe coherent quantum oscillations of the magnetic moment\ntrough the anisotropy barrier [12], a phenomenon that has no classical analog.\nIn this case, SMMs would become suitable qubits for quantum computing [13],\nwith the interesting feature that the operating frequency can be tuned locally by\nthe simple application of a magnetic field.\nA large part of this thesis is dedicated to the study of the interaction between\nSMMs and their environment, in particular the nuclear spins. This interaction is\ncrucial from many points of view. In the zero- or low-field regime, the tunneling\nprobability is very small, in fact so small that, until recently, there were serious\n\n\fIntroduction\n\n3\n\ndoubts about the observability of quantum tunneling of the magnetic moment\nin SMMs. This is due the fact that, in order to tunnel, the total electron spin\nstates on opposite sides of the anisotropy barrier must be in resonance within an\nenergy \u2206 that can be as small as \u223c 10\u221211 K in Mn12 -ac. Any static perturbation larger than that, would destroy the resonance condition and make tunneling\nimpossible. Prokof'ev and Stamp [14, 15] succeeded in explaining why tunneling\nwas actually observed in the experiments, by noticing that the coupling of the\ncluster spin with the nuclear spins in its surroundings, although several order of\nmagnitude larger than \u2206, is dynamic. The electron spin energy levels are therefore fluctuating in time with respect to each other, which gives rise to an effective\n\"tunneling window\" that depends on the strength of the coupling with the nuclei,\nas was subsequently demonstrated by experiments with isotopically substituted\n~\nsamples [16]. In the opposite regime, where the fast quantum oscillations of S\ncan be obtained by applying a strong perpendicular field, the nuclear spins play\nthe role of an intrinsic source of decoherence. Understanding this phenomenon is\nobviously essential for any attempt to use a magnetic qubit for quantum computing, since nuclear spins are an unavoidable presence in practically any material.\nThe decoherence due to nuclear spins is indeed important also for systems like\nthe flux qubit [17]. Chapter III of this thesis is dedicated to a review of the\ntheoretical aspects of the quantum behavior of SMMs, from the basic notions to\nthe details of the Prokof'ev-Stamp theory.\nDespite its relevance, the nuclear spin dynamics in SMMs at ultra-low temperature remained an essentially unexplored field. In chapter IV we report a\nthorough investigation of the dynamics of 55 Mn nuclei in Mn12 -ac. Our results\nuncover many basic aspects, some of which confirm the validity of the Prokof'evStamp theory, while others are totally new and have never been considered in\nany theoretical treatment of the coupled system of \"quantum spin + nuclei\". For\ninstance, we demonstrate that the quantum tunneling of the electron spin is a\nmechanism capable of producing nuclear relaxation at an unexpectedly high rate.\nWe also show that nuclei in different molecules are coupled with each other, an\nessential ingredient for the creation of a dynamic tunneling window. The analysis of the nuclear spin dynamics in large perpendicular fields confirms earlier\nresults obtained by specific heat experiments [11] concerning the increase of the\ntunneling rate. Finally, we consider for the first time the issue of the nuclear\nspin temperature in the presence of temperature-independent quantum tunneling\nfluctuations. Surprisingly, the nuclear spin temperature is found to remain in\nequilibrium with the lattice temperature down to T \u2243 20 mK! We discuss therefore the need for an extension of the Prokof'ev-Stamp theory to take into account\ninelastic tunneling events.\nIn chapter V we present our research on the low-temperature magnetic properties of a rather peculiar SMM, containing Mn6 molecular clusters that are characterized by a very small magnetic anisotropy because of the highly symmetric\nstructure. We find that the electron spin-lattice relaxation remains fast down to\n\n\f4\n\nIntroduction\n\nmillikelvin temperatures, which allows the observation of a long-range magnetic\nordering of the cluster spins, due only to the mutual dipolar interactions. The\nnature of this ordered state is already interesting in itself, but even more so when\ncompared to the situation in the highly anisotropic SMMs, where the freezing of\nthe cluster spins has made the investigation of the thermodynamic ground state\nimpossible so far. Experiments in disordered rare-earth spin systems have shown\nthat the application of a transverse field greatly facilitates the system in reaching\nits ground state [18], a strategy that seems promising for anisotropic SMMs as\nwell. Because of the absence of anisotropy, and therefore of quantum tunneling,\nthe nuclear spin dynamics in Mn6 offers also an interesting comparison with the\ncase of Mn12 -ac.\nAs may have become clear already, this thesis is focused uniquely on the\nfundamental aspects of the quantum spin dynamics of SMMs. The attempts to\nfind useful applications for molecular magnets have not stopped meanwhile, and\nwe think that the recent progress in patterning [19] and surface deposition [20] of\nMn12 -ac molecules may represent an actual breakthrough for both the magnetic\nstorage and the quantum computing purposes. Wherever this progress will lead\nto, we hope that the work presented here will help the scientific community to\ngain a deeper understanding of how the quantum phenomena at the molecular\nscale are influenced by the interaction with the environment.\n\n\f5\n\nII\nExperimental techniques\n\nThis chapter begins with a survey of the principles and the design of the setups\nused for the experiments reported in chapters IV and V. In addition, we discuss\nthe design and construction of two ultra low-T setups for static magnetic measurements, a SQUID magnetometer and a torquemeter, which are not involved in\nthe research presented in this thesis, but constitute a new and significant extension to the experimental facilities of our laboratory: \u00a72.4 and \u00a72.5 are therefore\nmeant as future reference for the newcomers in our research group, or anybody\ninterested in building ultra low-T magnetometers.\n\n2.1\n\nDilution refrigerator\n\nThe heart of of our ultra low-T setup is a 3 He/4 He dilution refrigerator. The\nworking principle (see e.g. [21] for details) is based on the fact that, even at\nT = 0, a liquid mixture of 3 He and 4 He does not separate completely: the Van\nder Waals force between a 3 He and a 4 He atom is larger than between two 3 He,\nthus a certain fraction of 3 He atoms will spontaneously dilute into the 4 He phase,\nuntil the Fermi energy of 3 He in the dilute phase equals the difference in binding\nenergies between 3 He-3 He and 3 He-4 He. If one distils some 3 He out of the dilute\nphase, more 3 He atoms will migrate from the pure 3 He phase into the dilute one to\nreestablish the equilibrium. The increase of entropy associated with this process\ncorresponds to the absorption of heat by the 3 He/4 He mixture, i.e. an effective\ncooling power. The cooling can be made continuous if the 3 He extracted from\nthe dilute phase is recondensed and injected on the side of the pure 3 He phase,\ntaking care that the incoming 3 He stream is properly cooled by exchanging heat\nwith the cold 3 He atoms that flow through the dilute phase.\nOur system is based on a Leiden Cryogenics MNK126-400ROF dilution refrigerator, fitted with a plastic mixing chamber that allows the sample to be\nthermalized directly by the 3 He flow, specially designed for our purposes in collaboration with G. Frossati. A scheme of the low-temperature part of the refrigerator is shown in Fig. 2.1, together with the NMR circuitry (see \u00a72.2.2). The\nmixing chamber consists of two concentric tubes, obtained by rolling a Kapton\nfoil coated with Stycast 1266 epoxy. The tops of each tube are glued into concentric Araldite pots: the inner pot receives the downwards flow of condensed\n3 He and, a few millimeters below the inlet, the phase separation between pure\n\n\f6\n\nExperimental techniques\n\nc\n\nb\n\nc\n\na\n\n(a) Coaxial cable connected to\nthe NMR spectrometer and\npulse generator.\n3\n\n(b) He distillator (\"still\") with cold plate.\n(c) Rotating shafts for the tunable\ncapacitors, accessible from the top\nof the refrigerator.\n(d) NMR matching capacitor.\n\nd\n\ne\n\n(e) NMR tuning capacitor.\n(f) Upper heat exchanger.\n(g) 80 mK pot.\n(h)\n\nl-cable, cut to one wavelength\n\nat 280 MHz.\n\nf\n\n(i) Lower heat exchanger.\n(j) Araldite mixing chamber.\n\ng\n\n(k) Upper thermometer.\n3\n\n(l) Pure He phase.\n(m) Double-wall Kapton tail.\n\n3\n\n(n) Forced downwards flow of He\n\nh\n\ni\n\nin the dilute phase.\n(o) Sample with NMR coil.\n(p) Openings in the inner Kapton tube\n3\n\nj\n\nto allow the return of the He flow.\n(q) Lower thermometer.\n(r) Conical vacuum plugs.\n\nk\nr\nl\nm\n\nn\no\n\nq\n\np\nr\n\nFig. 2.1 : Scheme of the low-T part of the dilution refrigerator with NMR\ncircuitry. For clarity we omit the vacuum can and the radiation shields anchored\nat the still and at the 80 mK pot. Only the narrow tail of the refrigerator is\ninserted in the bore of a 9 T superconducting magnet (not shown).\n\n\f2.1. Dilution refrigerator\n3 He\n\n7\n\nphase and dilute 3 He/4 He phase takes place. The circulation of 3 He is then\nforced downwards along the inner Kapton tube, which has openings on the bottom side to allow the return of the 3 He stream through the thin space in between\nthe tubes. Both the bottom of the Kapton tail and the outer pot are closed\nby conical Araldite plugs smeared with Apiezon N grease. The Kapton tail is\nabout 35 cm long and is surrounded by two silver-coated brass radiation shields,\none anchored at the 80 mK pot, the other at the still. The whole low-T part of\nthe refrigerator is closed by a vacuum can, which has itself a thin brass tail to\nsurround the Kapton part of the mixing chamber, and is inserted into the bore\nof an Oxford Instruments 9 Tesla NbTi superconducting magnet. In this way,\nonly Kapton and brass cylinders (plus the lowest Araldite plug) are placed in the\nhigh-field region, whereas all other high-conductivity metal parts (heat exchangers, 80 mK pot, 3 He distillator, etc.) are outside the magnet bore and subject\nonly to a small stray field. This design was intended to minimize eddy currents\nheating while moving the refrigerator through the pick-up coil of the SQUID\nmagnetometer (\u00a72.4), while thermalizing the sample directly by the contact with\nthe 3 He flow. As it turned out, the excellent thermalization obtained is this way\nis also essential for the success of the NMR experiments described in chapter IV,\nwhose significance depends crucially on the efficient cooling of the nuclear spins\n(\u00a74.4).\nThe temperature inside the mixing chamber is monitored by measuring with\na Picowatt AVS-47 bridge the resistance of two Speer carbon thermometers, one\nin the outer top Araldite pot, the other at the bottom of the Kapton tail, just\nbeside the sample. We have verified that the temperature is very uniform along\nthe whole chamber (except in the presence of sudden heat pulses): even at the\nlowest T , the mismatch between the measured values is typically . 0.5 mK. A\nLeiden Cryogenics Triple Current Source is used to apply heating currents to a\nmanganin wire, anti-inductively wound around a copper joint just above the 3 He\ninlet in the mixing chamber. In this way we can heat the incoming 3 He stream\nand uniformly increase the mixing chamber temperature.\nFor the 3 He circulation we employ an oil-free pumping system, consisting of a\nRoots booster pump (Edwards EH500) with a pumping speed of 500 m3 /h, backed\nby two 10 m3 /h dry scroll pumps (Edwards XDS10). The main pumping line is a\n\u2205 100 mm solid tube, fixed at one side with a flexible rubber joint that allows for\nan inclination of a few degrees, and connected to the head of the fridge by a \"T\"\npiece with two extra rubber bellows, to reduce the vibrations transmitted by the\npumping system. In this configuration, the system reaches a base temperature\nthat can be as low as 9 mK; with the extra wiring for NMR experiments, the base\ntemperature is \u223c 12 mK, and the practical operating temperature while applying\nrf -pulses is 15 - 20 mK (see \u00a72.2.3). The typical 3 He circulation rate at the base\ntemperature is \u1e45 \u223c 350 \u03bcmol/s, and the cooling power at 100 mK is Q\u0307 \u223c 150\n\u03bcW. When the Kapton tail is replaced by a flat plug, Q\u0307 can be increased up to\n700 \u03bcW @ 100 mK and \u1e45 \u223c 1200 \u03bcmol/s by applying extra heat to the still; with\n\n\f8\n\nExperimental techniques\n\nthe tail in place it's more difficult to increase the circulation rate, and Q\u0307 @ 100\nmK hardly exceeds 250 \u03bcW.\n\n2.2\n\nNuclear Magnetic Resonance\n\nThe NMR technique is applied since more than 50 years [22] to widely different\nresearch fields; in this thesis, we are interested in the use of nuclear spins as local\nprobes for magnetic fluctuations in solid-state systems, but also in the dynamics\nof the nuclei themselves, which appears to play an essential role in the quantum\nbehavior of single-molecule magnets.\n\n2.2.1\n\nBasics of pulse NMR\n\n~ z applied along\nThe Hamiltonian of a nuclear spin I~ placed in a magnetic field B\na certain axis ~z is:\n~z,\nH = ~\u03b3 I~ * B\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere \u03b3 is the gyromagnetic ratio, such that \u03bc = ~\u03b3I is the magnetic moment\nof the nucleus. The eigenstates |mi are the 2I + 1 projections of the spin along\n~z, having energies Em , m = \u2212I . . . I, separated from each other by the Zeeman\nsplitting Em+1 \u2212 Em = ~\u03b3Bz , which corresponds to the Larmor frequencies \u03c9 =\n\u03b3Bz for the classical precession. Transitions between adjacent Zeeman levels can\n~ rf (t), provided that the\nbe produced by introducing a time-dependent field B\n~ rf is not parallel to ~z. Considering\nmatrix elements hm|Brf |m + 1i 6= 0, i.e. B\n~ rf (t) = Brf ~x cos(\u03c9N t), the expectation\nfor simplicity a spin I = 1/2 and taking B\nvalue of the z component of the magnetic moment will oscillate in time at a\nfrequency \u03c9Rabi = \u03b3Brf (Rabi oscillations):\nh\u03bcz (t)i = h\u03bcz (0)i cos(\u03c9Rabi t).\n\n(2.2)\n\nIn a classical picture, this means that, if ~\u03bc(0) = ~\u03b3I~z, after a time t\u03c0/2 =\n\u03c0/(2\u03b3Brf ) the magnetic moment has been turned 90\u25e6 away from the ~z axis and\nlies in the xy plane. For this reason, the application of such an alternating field\nof frequency \u03c9N for a time t\u03c0/2 is called \"\u03c0/2-pulse\". The rotation angle can in\nfact take any value, by choosing the appropriate duration\nand strength of Brf .\n\u221a\nAfter a \u03c0/2-pulse the state of the system is |\u03c8i = 1/ 2(| + 1/2i + | \u2212 1/2i), and\nthe time evolution caused by the Hamiltonian (2.1) is equivalent to the classical\nLarmor precession of the magnetic moment within the xy plane, which produces\na rotating magnetic field that can be detected via the electromotive force induced\nin a pick-up coil with axis k ~x. In practice the same coil is used to produce Brf\nand to detect the Larmor precession.\nSince we always work with macroscopic ensembles of spins, it is convenient to\ndescribe the system in terms of its density matrix \u03c1. If the state of each spin\n\n\f2.2. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance\n\n9\n\nP\nin the system is described as |\u03c8i = m am |mi, then the matrix elements \u03c1m,m\u2032\nare the average over the sample of am a\u2217m\u2032 . The diagonal elements of \u03c1 represent\nthe populations of the levels, and the non-diagonal elements account for the\ncorrelation between different spins. Under thermal equilibrium at a temperature\nT , the non-diagonal terms of \u03c1 are zero, and the diagonal terms obey:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03c1m,m\n~\u03b3Bz\n= exp \u2212\n,\n(2.3)\n\u03c1m+1,m+1\nkB T\nwhich corresponds to a longitudinal (k Bz ) nuclear magnetization, Mz (T ), according to the Curie law:\nMz (T ) = N ~2 \u03b3 2\n\nI(I + 1)Bz\n,\n3kB T\n\n(2.4)\n\nwhere N is the number of spins per unit volume.\nBy means of rf -pulses as described above, it is possible to perturb the system\nand change its density matrix. For instance, the effect of a \u03c0-pulse on an ensemble\nof spins 1/2 in thermal equilibrium is to invert the diagonal elements of \u03c1, i.e.\nthe nuclear magnetization. After the inversion, the thermal equilibrium can be\nreestablished in the presence of perturbations that induce transitions between\nthe Zeeman levels, and of a reservoir that can absorb the heat released by the\nnuclear spins. The time constant for the recovery of the equilibrium values of the\ndiagonal elements of \u03c1 is T1 , the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation time.\nFar from equilibrium, it is possible to define a nuclear spin temperature Tnucl\ndifferent from the lattice T , provided that the ratio of the populations formally\nobeys a relation like (2.3) with Tnucl replacing T , and that \u03c1m,m\u2032 = 0 for m 6= m\u2032 .\nFor example, a \u03c0-pulse on a spin 1/2 produces a negative spin temperature. T1\ncan be then interpreted as timescale for the reequilibration of the spin- and lattice\ntemperatures.\nAfter a \u03c0/2 pulse, the diagonal elements of \u03c1 are identical and nonzero nondiagonal elements appear. This means that the spins are coherently precessing,\nthe correlation between the single Larmor precessions decaying with a time constant T2 \u2264 T1 , which is also the decay time for the non-diagonal elements of\n\u03c1.\nIn a real experiment, the signal produced by the Larmor precession after a\n\u03c0/2-pulse, called \"free induction decay\", actually decays on a time T2\u2217 \u2264 T2\nbecause of static field inhomogeneity, i.e. the fact that spins in different spatial\npositions may have different Bz , thus different \u03c9N . This static dephasing can\nbe recovered by means of spin echo. By applying a \u03c0-pulse at a time \u03c4 > T2\u2217\nafter the \u03c0/2-pulse, each spin is rotated 180\u25e6 about the axis of the coil. In\nthis way, the spins that are precessing \"too slow\" find themselves ahead of the\nfast ones. At time 2\u03c4 all spins are again precessing in phase (Fig. 2.2), giving\nrise to an echo of coherent precession whose amplitude depends on the effective\n\n\f10\n\nExperimental techniques\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\nfast\n\nslow\n\np/2\n\np\n\nFig. 2.2 : Sketch of the spin-echo sequence: (a) \u03c0/2-pulse; (b) Larmor precession and dephasing of the slow (light gray) and fast (dark gray) spins; (c) \u03c0-pulse;\n(d) refocusing of the precessions and formation of the echo.\np\n\np/2 p\nt\n\nM\nt\n\nt\n\nT )]\n\n)[1-2exp(-t/\n\nT)\n\n(0)exp(-2t/\n\nxy\n\nM(\n\n8\n\np\n\np/2\n\n2\n\nt\n\nt\n\nFig. 2.3 : Left: T2 measurement by echo decay.

We can therefore measure T2 by\napplying a \u03c0/2 \u2212 \u03c0 pulse sequence with increasing values of \u03c4 , and observing the\n\u03c4 \u2212dependence of the echo amplitude.\nAs regards T1 , we remark that the coil is sensitive only to the projection of\nthe Larmor precession along its axis, i.e. \u22a5 ~z. The effect of a \u03c0/2-pulse, or of an\necho sequence, is indeed to project the z-component of the nuclear magnetization\ninto the xy plane and make it measurable. For instance, an echo sequence after\na \u03c0-pulse yields a signal which is proportional to the initial magnetization, but\nwith opposite phase as compared to the signal without \u03c0-pulse. By introducing\na waiting time \u03c4 between the \u03c0-pulse and the echo sequence, one can access the\ntime evolution of the z-component of the magnetization, i.e. the recovery of\nthe equilibrium state and thereby the time constant T1 . A sketch of the pulse\nsequences used to measure T1 and T2 is shown in Fig. 2.3.\n\n\f2.2. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance\n\n2.2.2\n\n11\n\nInstruments and circuitry\n\nA scheme of the NMR setup used for the present work is shown in Fig. 2.4.\nThe non-commercial electronic devices have been developed by R. Hulstman,\nand a computer running a Pascal management program written by J. Witteveen\n[23] controls the generation of the NMR pulses and the detection of the signal.\nThe pulse sequences are obtained by programming a home-made device, which\nopens the gate of the pulse amplifier (Kalmus 166UP) at the specified times:\none typically waits 5 \u03bcs before the full power of the amplifier (typ. \u223c 100 W) is\navailable, and closes the gate as soon as the power is no longer necessary, to avoid\nleakage currents to the NMR coil. The rf -signal to be amplified is generated by\nthe frequency synthesizer (Farnell SSG1000), but is first handled by a rf -gate,\ndriven by the pulse programmer. The purpose of the rf -gate is to produce pulses\nof the desired length and phase. For instance, to measure a spin echo we first\nproduce a \u03c0/2 \u2212 \u03c0 sequence with all the pulses in phase with the reference signal,\nand record the result; then we repeat the sequence but now with a 180\u25e6 phase\nshift on the \u03c0/2-pulse, and we subtract the measured signal from the previous\none. In this way, the \"true\" NMR signal from the second sequence, which has\nopposite sign with respect to the first because of the phase shift in the \u03c0/2pulse, is actually added to the first one, whereas we cancel out the offset of the\nspectrometer and the ringing (i.e. the fictitious signal that appears because of the\nelectrical resonance of the circuit) produced by the \u03c0/2-pulse [24]. The amplified\npulses are then fed to the resonant circuit.\nThe circuitry we used includes two tunable cylindrical teflon capacitors, mounted\nat the still of the dilution refrigerator (see Fig. 2.1) and driven by rotatable\nshafts. The capacitor in parallel to the rf -line is used to match the impedance\nof the circuit to 50 \u03a9, whereas the one in series to the NMR coil tunes the frequency of the resonator. The peculiarity of our circuit is that, because of the\ndistance (\u223c 50 cm) separating the capacitors from the NMR coil in the mixing\nchamber, we had to introduce a \u03bb-cable between coil and tuning capacitor. At\nthe frequency where the cable is precisely one wavelength, the circuit is indeed\nidentical to the standard concentrated circuit. Away from the \u03bb-frequency, the\ncable adds extra inductance or capacitance. More importantly, since the \u03bb-cable\nis a low-conductivity thin brass coax for low-T applications, the quality factor\nof the resonator (which includes the cable!) is drastically reduced. Although\nthis affects the sensitivity of the circuit, it also broadens the accessible frequency\nrange without need to retune the capacitors. We found that, cutting the cable\nfor one wavelength at \u223c 280 MHz, the circuit is usable between (at least) 220\nand 320 MHz. Once the desired frequency range is chosen and the \u03bb-cable is cut\naccordingly, the NMR coil must be constructed by first mounting it just near the\ntuning capacitor, i.e. making a \"standard\" concentrated circuit. If this circuit\nresonates in the same range as the \u03bb-frequency, the coil can be safely moved into\nthe mixing chamber.\n\n\f12\n\nExperimental techniques\n\n/4\n\nrf gate\n\nquadrature\ndetector\nRe\n\nIm\nfilters\n\nmatch\n\nfrequency\nsynthesizer\n\ntune\n\n- line\n\ngated pulse\namplifier\n\nreference\n\npreamp\n\n\u0001\n\ncoil\npulse\nprogrammer\n\ncomputer\n\nADC\n\nrf signal\nTTL line\ndata bus\n\nFig. 2.4 : Scheme of the NMR setup.

(c)\nThermometer at the top of the mixing chamber, close to the 3 He outlet, after a\nsingle spin-echo sequence.\n\n\f14\n\nExperimental techniques\n\nThe NMR signal induced in the coil is first passed though a low-noise DOTY\npreamplifier placed at the top of the cryostat, then detected by a phase-sensitive\nquadrature detector, and finally stored in the memory buffer of a flash A/D converter. The results of the positive and negative pulse sequences are subtracted\nand dumped in the measurement data file. The diodes in parallel to the preamplifier and the \u03bb/4-cable, together with the diodes in series to the power line,\nare used to separate the small NMR signal from the high-power pulses. For the\npulse amplifier, the diodes in series are a short circuit, whereas the \u03bb/4-cable is\nan open circuit since it is short-circuited at the opposite end by the diodes in\nparallel. In this way all the power goes in the resonator and does not damage the\npreamplifier. Conversely, the series diodes are an open circuit for the very small\nsignal picked up by the NMR coil, which is therefore entirely conveyed towards\nthe preamplifier.\n\n2.2.3\n\nHeating effects\n\nApplying NMR pulses of typically 100 W for several microseconds to a copper\ncoil at T \u2243 15 mK is potentially very harmful for the thermal stability of the\nsample and of the 3 He/4 He mixture in which it is immersed. As discussed in \u00a72.1,\nour setup is specially designed to circumvent this problem. In Fig. 2.5 we show\nthree examples of the magnitude of the heating effects that arise when applying\nspin-echo NMR pulse sequences consisting of a 12 \u03bcs \u03c0/2-pulse followed by a 24\n\u03bcs \u03c0-pulse after 45 \u03bcs. Panels (a) and (b) show the temperatures as measured by\nthe thermometer placed at the bottom of the Kapton tail, just next to the NMR\ncoil and the sample, whereas the temperature in panel (c) is taken at the top of\nthe mixing chamber in the outer part of the wide Araldite pot, i.e. 35 cm past\nthe sample in the 3 He path. In both cases, a very sharp peak in T is visible at\nthe instant when the pulses are applied, which is simply due to the direct (and\ninstantaneous) heating of the thermometers by the electromagnetic field produced\nby the coil, thus it does not reflect a \"real\" increase in the temperature of the 3 He\nbath. The situation is particularly clear in panel (c), where the radiative heating\nspike is quickly recovered, and only after a few minutes the wave of warmer 3 He\natoms comes along. By comparing (a) and (b) with (c), it is also clear that the\nheight of the radiative spike is lower in the upper thermometer, which is indeed\nfarther away from the coil. Panel (a) demonstrates that, with an interval of 10\nminutes between the sequences, the temperature of the sample can be kept very\nstable at \u2243 15 mK. Even with just 1 minute waiting time (b), the increase of the\nbaseline of the 3 He bath temperature does not exceed 5 mK!\n\n2.3\n\nac - susceptometer\n\nFor the frequency-dependent ac-susceptibility measurements reported in chapter\nV we used a simple and compact home-made susceptometer based on the mutual\n\n\f2.3. ac - susceptometer\n\n15\n\nVs\n\nlock-in\n\nIp\nV / I\nsample\n\nconverter\n\nFig. 2.6 : Schematic drawing of the ac-susceptometer.\ninductance principle. A sketch of the instrument is shown in Fig. 2.6. A primary\ncoil, consisting of 250 turns of \u2205 100 \u03bcm NbTi superconducting wire is wound\non top of two secondary coils, each consisting of 600 turns of \u2205 40 \u03bcm copper\nwire, and connected in series with opposite polarity. When an alternating current\nIp (t) = Ip cos(\u03c9t) is passed through the primary coil, it induces a voltage Vs =\nV1 \u2212 V2 in the secondary, where V1 and V2 are the voltages at each section of the\nsecondary coil, and the minus sign is due to the opposite winding directions:\nVs = \u03c9Ip (M1 \u2212 M2 ) cos(\u03c9t + \u03c0/2).\n\n(2.5)\n\nThe above relation holds if there is no current flowing in the secondary coils, e.g.\nwhen they are connected to an ideal voltmeter. The mutual inductances are given\nby Mi = (1 + \u03c7i )f , where (i = 1, 2) andf = f (Np , Ns , Ap , As , . . .) is a factor that\ndepends on the geometry, the area and the number of turns of the primary and\nsecondary coils, and \u03c7i is the magnetic susceptibility of the material filling each\nsecondary coil. By leaving coil 2 empty (\u03c72 = 0) and filling coil 1 with the sample\nto be investigated, we obtain:\nVs = \u03c9Ip cos(\u03c9t + \u03c0/2)\u03c7.\n\n(2.6)\n\nThe susceptibility of the sample is therefore easily measured by connecting the\nsecondary coil to a lock-in amplifier (Stanford SR830); the phase-sensitive de-\n\n\f16\n\nExperimental techniques\n\ntection allows to discern both the real and the imaginary part of the complex\nsusceptibility \u03c7 = \u03c7\u2032 + i\u03c7\".\nTo apply the primary current Ip we either introduced a 500 k\u03a9 resistor in\nseries to the 5 V excitation circuit of the lock-in, or we used a home-built V/I\nconverter that allows to have more current at low frequencies, since the induced\nvoltage is \u221d \u03c9. Using the V/I converter we may easily measure down to frequencies \u223c 1 Hz, whereas above \u223c 1 kHz it is advisable to simply use the 500 k\u03a9\nseries resistor, which eliminates the slight phase rotations that the V/I converter\nstarts to introduce at high frequencies. With a typical value of Ip \u223c 50 \u03bcA, the\nalternating field produced at the sample is \u03bc0 Hp \u223c 1 \u03bcT.\nThe susceptometer is small enough to fit vertically in the tail of the dilution\nrefrigerator, or even horizontally in the outer part of the upper Araldite pot (cf.\nFig. 2.1), for measurements without static external field.\n\n2.4\n\nSQUID magnetometer\n\nThe SQUID magnetometer described in this section is designed to allow highsensitivity measurements on powder samples down to T \u223c 10 mK. For example,\nmetallic nanoclusters show spectacular quantum-size effects in their thermodynamic properties [25] at very low temperatures, but their magnetic susceptibility\nis very small in this regime. Furthermore, most of those materials are highly airsensitive, thus it is very convenient to introduce and keep the sample in a sealed\nglass tube, which is also ideal to perform preliminary measurements at T > 1.5\nK in commercial SQUID magnetometers. One of the requirements for the design\ndiscussed here is indeed the compatibility with the sealed sample holders used\nin other experiments, without any need to further manipulate the sample. The\nreally challenging part of the design consists in moving the sample through the\npick-up coils while it is at T \u223c 10 mK inside the mixing chamber of the dilution refrigerator. For samples with such extremely small magnetic signals such\na measure is needed because the two components of the pick-up coil will never\nperfectly compensate one another, leaving an empty-coil signal that could wash\nout the signal of the sample to be measured. As we shall discuss below, this has\nrequired a system that moves the whole dilution refrigerator insert.\n\n2.4.1\n\nWorking principle\n\nA SQUID (Superconduting QUantum Interference Device) is basically an ultrasensitive flux-to-voltage converter, that exploits the peculiar quantum properties\nof closed superconduting circuits. To understand its working principle, we recall\nthat the superconducting state can be described as the condensation of paired\nelectrons (Cooper pairs) into an ordered phase characterized by a complex order\n\n\f2.4.

The dashed\nline is the integration path.\nA SQUID is obtained by interrupting a superconducting ring with one (rf SQUID) or two (dc-SQUID) Josephson junctions, i.e. weak links where the superconductivity is locally suppressed but the Cooper pairs can cross by quantum\ntunneling. The essential feature added by a weak link is that it is no longer\npossible to find a closed path through the ring such that ~j = 0 everywhere, since\n~j 6= 0 through the weak link (Fig 2.7). This adds an extra contribution \u03c6\u2032 to the\nphase of the order parameter:\nZ\nm\n\u2032\n~j * d~l,\n(2.14)\n\u03c6 =\ne~|\u03c8|2 w.l.\nwhere the integral is along the weak link, supposed to be so thin that the magnetic\nflux in negligible, and |\u03c8|2 in the limit of small currents can be taken equal to\nthe bulk value. The condition of single-valued order parameter becomes:\nZZ\n2e\n~ * dS\n~ = \u03c6\u2032 + 2\u03c0 \u03a6 = \u03c6\u2032 + 2\u03c0 \u03a6ext + LIs = 2\u03c0n.\n(2.15)\nB\n\u03c6\u2032 +\n~\n\u03a60\n\u03a60\nIt follows that the screening current Is (\u03a6) must be a periodic function of \u03a6ext /\u03a60 :\nIs = Ic sin(2\u03c0\u03a6/\u03a60 ) = Ic sin[2\u03c0(n \u2212 \u03a6/\u03a60 )] = Ic sin \u03c6\u2032 ,\n\n(2.16)\n\nwhich is the famous Josephson phase-current relation. Ic is the Josephson critical\ncurrent, i.e. the maximum supercurrent that can pass through the link without\ndissipation.\nBy applying an external flux which varies linearly in time, a constant voltage\nV = \u2212d\u03a6ext /dt develops across the weak link.

Combining (2.17) and (2.16) we find that\na constant voltage produces a linear increase of \u03c6\u2032 with time, i.e. the voltage is\nproportional to the time derivative of the phase:\nV =\n\n~ d\u03c6\n.\n2e dt\n\n(2.18)\n\nThis relation is useful to obtain the V \u2212 I characteristic of a current-biased\nJosephson junction. When I > Ic , the current through the weak link causes\ndissipation, which can be accounted for by a resistance R in parallel to the ideal\nJosephson junction described by (2.16). Moreover, a realistic junction is formed\nby two superconducting pads separated by a very thin barrier, so that we have\nto add a capacitance C to the model. We may then write:\nI = Ic sin \u03c6\u2032 +\n\ndV\n~ d\u03c6\u2032 ~C d2 \u03c6\u2032\nV\n+C\n= Ic sin \u03c6\u2032 +\n+\n,\nR\ndt\n2eR dt\n2e dt2\n\n(2.19)\n\nwhich leads to a V /I curve of the type shown in Fig. 2.8.\nA dc-SQUID, like the one used in our setup, is operated by biasing the junctions J1 and J2 with a current Ibias > Ic , such that a voltage develops across\nthem (Fig. 2.9). The essential feature is that the voltage can be modulated by\nan applied flux, since the critical current Ic also depends on \u03a6. Indeed, after\nsome calculation one finds that the screening current Is is related to the critical\ncurrent Ic of the junctions (assumed to be identical) by:\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u03a6ext + LIs\nIc\n\u2032\n\u2032\n.\n(2.20)\nsin \u03c61 \u2212 sin \u03c61 \u2212 2\u03c0\nIs =\n2\n\u03a60\nIc is obtained by maximizing Is , yielding the periodic form of Ic (\u03a6ext ) shown\nin Fig. 2.9.

Notice that small a fraction of a flux quantum\ncan produce voltage changes of the order of millivolts! In the practice a dcSQUID is used in feedback mode by employing a so-called Flux-Lock Loop (FLL),\ni.e. adding a feedback coil that produces a compensating flux such that V =\nconst. This increases the accuracy and the dynamic range of the measurement,\nand allows to implement noise-reducing detection schemes. For more details on\nSQUID sensors, see [26, 27].\nTo use a dc-SQUID in an actual magnetometer, it is still necessary(1) to produce a current proportional to the magnetic moment of the sample to be measured. Such a current can be injected in the input coil to produce a flux that is\ncoupled to the SQUID ring by the mutual inductance M. Typically, the input\ncurrent is obtained by constructing a closed superconducting circuit which in(1)\n\nExcept in a rather radical design like the \"microSQUID\" [28]\n\n\f2.4. SQUID magnetometer\n\n21\n\ncludes the SQUID's input coil on one side, and terminates with a pick-up coil on\nthe other side. Once the circuit has been cooled down below the superconducting\ncritical temperature, the enclosed flux is constant. Any change in the magnetic\npermeability of the circuit, possibly due to the sample, will result in a screening\ncurrent that, while keeping the total flux constant, produces the required flux in\nthe input coil. In our case, the change in permeability of the pick-up circuit is\nobtained by vertically moving the whole dilution refrigerator (\u00a72.4.3), whose tail,\nthat contains the sample, is inserted in the pick-up coil.\nBecause of the high sensitivity, it is essential to make sure that no sources of\nflux other than the sample may couple with the SQUID. This can be done by\nemploying a gradiometer, which in its simplest form consists of two coils wound\nin opposite direction, so that the flux produced by any uniform magnetic field\ncancels out, and only the gradient of B can be detected (first-order gradiometer).\nA further improvement is the second-order gradiometer, shown in Fig. 2.10,\nwhich is obtained by inserting a coil with 2N windings between two coils with\nN turns each, wound opposite to the central one. This design eliminates also\nthe effects of linear field gradients. Furthermore, according to the reciprocity\nprinciple [29], the flux \u03a6 produced in a coil of arbitrary geometry by a magnetic\n~ r ) produced by the same coil in\nmoment \u03bc at position ~r is related to the field B(~\n~r when carrying a current I such that:\n~ * ~\u03bc = \u03a6I.\nB\n\n(2.21)\n\nThe field produced by a single-loop coil is equivalent to the field of a magnetic\ndipole, whereas a first-order gradiometer is a magnetic quadrupole, and a secondorder is an octupole, so that the fields they produce vary in space like r \u22123 , r \u22124\nand r \u22125 , respectively. From Eq.(2.21) it is clear that a second-order gradiometer\nis the least sensitive to magnetic fields produced outside of the coil system.\nThe magnetic moment of the sample can be detected by moving it through\nthe pick-up coil. The enclosed flux is easily obtained from the flux induced by a\ndipole with magnetic moment ~\u03bc k ~z at a position z along the axis in a loop of\nradius a placed at z = z0 :\n\nf (z \u2212 z0 ) =\n\na2\n[a2 + (z \u2212 z0 )2 ]3/2\n\n\u03bc0\nf (z \u2212 z0 )\u03bc,\n\u03a6loop (z) =\n2\n\"\n\u00132 #\u22123/2\n\u0012\n1\nz02 z\n=\n1+ 2\n\u22121\n.\na\na\nz0\n\n(2.22)\n(2.23)\n\nIf the upper and lower coils of the gradiometer are placed at z = d and z = \u2212d,\nrespectively, then the total picked-up flux is:\n\u03a6pu (z) = N\n\n\u03bc0\n[f (z \u2212 d) \u2212 2f (z) + f (z + d)]\u03bc.\n2\n\n(2.24)\n\n\f22\n\nExperimental techniques\n4\n3\n\nm\n\n2\n\n0\n\nd\n\nz/d\n\n1\n\n-1\n\na\n\n-2\n-3\n\n-0.6 -0.4 -0.2\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n-4\n\n(2a/m0m) F\nFig. 2.10 : A second-order gradiometer in Helmoltz geometry (a = 2d) and the\nmagnetic flux induced by a dipole moving along z.

SQUID magnetometer\n\n2.4.2\n\n23\n\nDesign and construction of the pick-up circuit\n\nThe circuitry for our SQUID magnetometer is, with a few additions, based on the\nprinciples discussed above. The niobium dc-SQUID sensor is part of a Conductus\nLTS iMAG system, which includes a FLL circuitry to be placed just outside the\ncryostat, and is connected to the SQUID controller by a hybrid optical-electric\ncable. To couple a magnetic signal to the SQUID we constructed a secondorder gradiometer by winding a \u2205 100 \u03bcm NbTi wire on a brass coil-holder, to\nbe inserted in the bore of the Oxford Instruments 9 T NbTi superconducting\nmagnet. The gradiometer coils have \u2205 36 mm (a = 18 mm) and d = 9 mm,\ndue to the \u2205 34 mm vacuum can of the refrigerator that contains the sample.\nThe leads of the pick-up circuit, which are tightly twisted and shielded by a\nNb capillary, are screwed onto the input pads of the SQUID to obtain a closed\nsuperconducting circuit. The input inductance of the SQUID sensor is Lin = 600\nnH; since Lleads \u223c 200 nH and, given the dimensions, Lpu \u223c Lin + Lleads already\nwith N = 1, it follows from Eq. (2.26) that the most convenient choice of windings\nfor the gradiometer(3) is 1-2-1. The mutual inductance between SQUID ring and\ninput coil is M = 10 nH, which means that ftr \u223c 1/200.\nThe FLL included in the Conductus electronics is able to compensate for 500\n(max)\n\u03a60 at the SQUID ring, which means that a maximum flux \u03a6pu\n= 500/ftr \u223c 105\n\u03a60 can be picked up by the gradiometer without saturating the system. The\nmaximum magnetic moment \u03bc(max) is therefore [cf. Eq. (2.24) and Fig. 2.10]:\n\u03bc(max) \u2248\n\n2a (max)\n\u03a6\n\u223c 1018 \u03bcB \u223c 10\u22122 emu.\n0.6\u03bc0 pu\n\n(2.27)\n\nIn order to extend the dynamic range, we have built an extra flux transformer on\nthe pick-up circuit, which allows to introduce a magnetic flux from the outside\nto compensate for the flux induced by the sample. By using the SQUID as a\nnull-meter, there is the extra advantage that no current circulates in the pickup circuit, thus the field at the sample is precisely the field produced by the\nmagnet, without the extra field that would be produced by a current in the\ngradiometer. The flux transformer consists of 16 turns of NbTi wire, wound\non top of 1 loop of the pick-up wire and shielded by a closed lead box. In the\nsame box we glued the pick-up leads on a 100 \u03a9 chip resistor, which is used to\nlocally heat the circuit above the superconducting Tc and eliminate the trapped\nflux. The flux transformer is fed by a Keithley 220 current source, whereas the\nheater is operated by one of the three current sources in the Leiden Cryogenics\nTriple Current Source used for the refrigerator; both sources are controlled by a\ncomputer program (see \u00a72.4.5)\nDespite the efforts to isolate the system from external vibrations, the powerful\npumps of the dilution refrigerator still provide a non-negligible mechanical noise.\nIn particular, the Roots pump has a vibration spectrum with a lowest peak at\n(3)\n\nRecall that \u03a6pu \u221d N but Lpu \u221d N 2 .\n\n\f24\n\nExperimental techniques\n\n\u223c 25 Hz. To prevent the possible flux changes induced by such vibrations when\ncoupled to a magnetic field, we added an extra low-pass filter on the pick-up\ncircuit [31] in the form of a 17 mm long \u2205 0.3 mm copper wire in parallel with\nthe pick-up leads. At T = 4.2 K such a wire has a resistance R \u2243 11 \u03bc\u03a9, which\ntogether with the input inductance Lin = 600 nH of the SQUID yields a cutoff\nfrequency\nfl.p. =\n\n1 R\n\u2243 3 Hz.\n2\u03c0 Lin\n\n(2.28)\n\nThe filter is contained in a separate Pb-shielded box inserted between the flux\ntransformer and the SQUID. The pick-up leads and the copper wire are contacted\nvia Nb pads.\nA picture of the SQUID circuitry is shown in Fig. 2.11. The SQUID, the\nfilter and the flux transformer are mounted on a radiation shield of the magnet\nhanging. The whole system is inserted in a 90 liter helium cryostat. The magnet\nhanging is stabilized by triangular phosphor-bronze springs (not shown in Fig\n2.11) that press against the inner walls of the cryostat.\n\n2.4.3\n\nVertical movement\n\nThe movement of the sample through the gradiometer is obtained by lifting the\nwhole dilution refrigerator. For this purpose, the refrigerator is fixed on a movable\nflange, while the top of the cryostat is closed by a rubber bellow. On the flange\nwe screwed the nuts of three recirculating balls screws (SKF SN3 20 \u00d7 5R), which\nallow a very smooth displacement of the nut by turning the screw(4) . The base\nof each screw is mounted on ball bearings and is fitted with a gearwheel. The\ngearwheels are connected by a toothed belt (Brecoflex 16 T5 / 1400) driven by\na three-phase AC servomotor (SEW DFY71S B TH 2.5 Nm) that can exert a\ntorque up to 2.5 Nm. In this way, the rotation of the servomotor is converted\ninto the vertical movement of the dilution refrigerator insert. The movement is so\nsmooth that the consequent vibrations are hardly perceptible and do not exceed\nthe vibrations due to the 3 He pumping system.\nThe motor is driven by a servo-regulator (SEW MDS60A0015-503-4-00) that\ncan be controlled by a computer. For safety reasons an electromagnetic brake\nis fitted, that blocks the motor in case of power failure. In addition, a set of\nswitches is mounted along one of the pillars that support the screws: when the\nflange reaches the highest or the lowest allowed position, the switches force the\nmotor to brake independently of the software instructions. The maximum allowed\nvertical displacement is 10 cm.\nA picture of the top of the cryostat with the vertical movement elements is\nshown in Fig. 2.12.\n(4)\nThe friction between nut and screw is so low that, by placing the screw vertically and leaving\nthe nut free, the nut would start to turn and fall off the screw just by gravity!\n\n\f2.4.

SQUID magnetometer\n\n2.4.4\n\n27\n\nGrounding and shielding\n\nThe shielding of the SQUID sensor and electronics is of course a crucial issue\nfor the successful design of a SQUID-based magnetometer. As mentioned in\n\u00a72.4.2, the low-temperature parts are shielded by superconducting Pb boxes or\nNb capillaries. Strange as it may sound, the electronics outside the cryostat posed\nin fact many more problems. The reason is that the Conductus iMAG system\nuses beautiful hybrid optical-electric cables for the communication between the\nSQUID controller and the FLL electronics on top of the cryostat, but in the cable\nthat connects the FLL to the SQUID sensor, the ground is used as return line for\nthe signals! This means that any ground loop involving the SQUID electronics\nwill completely destroy the functionality of the system. Obviously, all the outer\nmetallic parts in the system (e.g. the case of the SQUID sensor, the vacuum\nfeedthrough for the cryocable, etc.) are connected to the same electrical ground,\nincluding the GPIB communication terminals.\nThe best way to avoid ground loops in the SQUID system would be to ground\nthe SQUID sensor and its cable at the cryostat (and take care that it remains a\nvery clean ground), and connect the controller to an isolation transformer [32].\nThis method is not practicable when communication with the computer via the\nGPIB bus is needed, and the same computer is connected to another instrument\nthat requires a common ground with the cryostat (this is the case for the Picowatt AVS-47 resistance bridge). The only choice is therefore to ground the\ncontroller at its power cord and float the whole SQUID circuitry, all the way to\nthe SQUID sensor inside the cryostat and the shields of the pick-up circuit (which\nmust be connected to the SQUID ground). This is already a rather cumbersome\noperation, but it's not yet sufficient. We found out that, in this configuration,\nthe FLL electronics and the room-temperature cables around it are not enough\nshielded from the electromagnetic interference(5) generated by the motor during\nthe vertical movement of the dilution refrigerator. This sort of interference does\nnot annihilate the functionality of the SQUID like a ground loop would do, nor\ndoes it simply induce an increase of the instrumental noise: the effect of bad\nshielding is that the SQUID system behaves as if it were connected to a nonsuperconduting, inductive circuit! It obviously took some time before we realized\nthis, since the inductive behavior of the pick-up system is one of the most expectable failures, which can be due to any weakening of the superconductivity in\nthe circuit, for instance because of a bad contact on the SQUID input pads. The\nfull functionality of the magnetometer was reached by enclosing the FLL and the\nroom-temperature SQUID cables into an extra copper shield, grounded at the\ncryostat but separated from the SQUID ground.\n\n(5)\n\nWe obviously took care that the motor does not touch the cryostat ground.\n\n\f28\n\n2.4.5\n\nExperimental techniques\n\nAutomation\n\nThe operation of the SQUID magnetometer can be programmed in a completely\nautomatic way by a Delphi software developed by W. G. J. Angenent [33], that\nintegrates the SQUID controller, the magnet power supply, the servomotor controller, the thermometers resistance bridge and the current sources for the flux\ntransformer and the pick-up heater.\nThe software includes a proportional controller that drives the Keithley 220\ncurrent source in order to null the SQUID voltage, in case the user chooses the\nmeasure in feedback mode rather than just recording the SQUID voltage. Another option is between continuous or step-by-step vertical movement, the latter\nbeing more convenient for the feedback measuring mode. Furthermore, the software already contains routines for fitting the SQUID voltage or the feedback\ncurrent and extract the magnetization. By programming a sequence of, for instance, several measurements at constant temperature and increasing fields, one\ncan obtain a whole magnetization curve without need of any intervention of the\nuser.\nA very user-friendly Windows interface is supplied, by which the user can set\nall the parameters of the measurement, control each single instrument, program\nmeasurement sequences and analyze the data. A screenshot of the user interface\nis shown in Fig. 2.13.\n\n2.5\n\nTorque magnetometer\n\nA torque magnetometer (torquemeter, in brief) is the ideal instrument to complement the SQUID on the high-field side, since its sensitivity grows linearly with\nthe field, and it suffers none of the limitations due to the critical field of the superconducting parts of a SQUID magnetometer. We constructed a torquemeter to\nbe installed in a different cryostat, fitted with a 18 T Oxford Instruments Nb3 Sn\nsuperconducting magnet and a smaller dilution refrigerator (Oxford Kelvinox 25),\nwhich was used previously for specific heat measurements [34]. Again we took\ncare of preserving the compatibility with other setups, namely the calorimeter:\nthe samples used for specific heat experiments can be directly recycled for torque\nmagnetometery.\n\n2.5.1\n\nPrinciples of cantilever magnetometery\n\n~ experiences a\nA sample with magnetic moment ~\u03bc placed in a magnetic field B\n~\ntorque T given by:\n~\nT~ = ~\u03bc \u00d7 B.\n\n(2.29)\n\n~ which can happen\nThe torque is therefore nonzero only if ~\u03bc is not parallel to B,\nif the sample has an intrinsic magnetic anisotropy and the anisotropy axis is not\n\n\f2.5.

For a powder isotropic sample, or a\nnon-oriented powder anisotropic sample, T = 0. Still, such a sample can experi~ = \u2207(~\n~ \u03bc * B)\n~ if the magnetic field is not uniform. For instance, the\nence a force F\nmagnetic field along the axis (~z ) of a magnet has, to a very good approximation,\na quadratic dependence on the distance from the field center:\nB(z) = B0 (1 \u2212 Gz 2 ),\n\n(2.30)\n\nwhere G is a constant that only depends on the geometry of the magnet coils.\n~ = (dB/dz)~\u03bc = \u22122GzB0 \u03bc\nThe magnetic force on a powder sample is therefore F\n~.\nIf the sample is mounted on a torsion cantilever at a distance r from the rotation\naxis, it exerts a torque:\nT~ = \u2212(2GzB0 )~r \u00d7 ~\u03bc,\n\n(2.31)\n\nwhich produces a displacement of the extremity of the cantilever(6) \u2206z = T /E,\nwhere E is an elastic constant. If \u2206z \u226a z, then 2Gzr/E = K is just a constant\n\n(6)\nIn reality it is a rotation, that can be approximated as a displacement of the extremity when\nthe rotation angle is very small.\n\n\f30\n\nExperimental techniques\n\nthat depends on the cantilever and its position along the magnet(7) . The magnetic\nmoment can therefore be extracted from a measurement of the displacement \u2206z:\n\u2206z = \u2212KB0 \u03bc.\n\n(2.32)\n\nThe deflection of the cantilever can be measured in several ways, including\npiezo-resistive [35] and optical [36] methods, but a simplest effective option is to\nshape the extremity of the cantilever as a platelet, and measure the changes in\nthe capacitance formed by the platelet facing a suitable counterelectrode [37, 38,\n39]. Calling C0 = \u01eb0 A/d0 the capacitance of the system at rest, where A is the\narea of the platelet and d0 the distance at rest from the counterelectrode, the\ndisplacement \u2206z produced by the magnetic force translates into a change in the\ncapacitance:\n!\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2206z 2\n\u2206z\n+ ... .\n(2.33)\n+\n\u2206C = C0 \u2212\nd0\nd0\nFor a paramagnetic sample and a cantilever placed above the field center, Eq.\n(2.32) simply implies that the sample is pushed down towards the field maximum,\nthus if the counterelectrode is below the cantilever, C increases with field. In\nparticular, as long as \u2206z \u226a d0 so that we can retain only the linear term in\n(2.33), we may write:\n\u2206C = K\n\nC0\nB\u03bc.\nd0\n\n(2.34)\n\nThe scheme of a typical measurement configuration is shown in Fig. 2.14.\nNotice that, at constant \u03bc, the capacitance change (which sets the instrumental sensitivity) grows linearly with field; this is why torque magnetometery is\nessentially a high-field technique. The magnetic moment is typically obtained by\nperforming field-sweep measurements of the unbalance of a capacitance bridge,\nthen dividing the results by the applied field. Obviously, one should discard the\ndata around zero field, since even the tiniest noise would produce a diverging\neffect. It is not advisable to perform temperature sweeps at constant field, since\nthe T -dependence of C0 and d0 would affect the results.\n\n2.5.2\n\nDesign and construction\n\nFrom the previous discussion, it is clear that there are several possibilities to\nincrease the sensitivity of a torquemeter: (i) use a soft cantilever (small E);\n(ii) increase the distance r of the sample from the rotation axis; (iii) build a\ncapacitor with large area and very small distance between the plates; (iv) place\nthe torquemeter far from the field center. The fourth option must be taken with\n(7)\n\nNotice that K has a sign: K > 0 above the field center, and K < 0 below.\n\n\f2.5.

The magnitude of the field inhomogeneity is largely exaggerated.\ncare, and in our case z is determined by the position of the three experimental\nslots available in the refrigerator [40]: one slot is precisely at the center, the other\ntwo are \u223c 25 mm above and below. The longitudinal inhomogeneity factor [cf.\nEq. (2.30)] of the Nb3 Sn magnet used here is G \u2243 2.8*10\u22125 T/mm2 , which means\nthat a torquemeter in the upper slot experiences a field gradient dB/dz \u2243 0.035B0\nT/mm. Contrary to the setup described in \u00a72.1, in this refrigerator the sample\nis in vacuum, thus it must be thermalized by the cantilever itself.\nThe system, shown in Fig. 2.15, lies on an Araldite base, screwed laterally\nbetween two wide copper slabs that constitute the cold finger connected to the\nmixing chamber (not shown). The torquemeter is designed as a symmetric torsion balance, to avoid the possible contribution of the platelet to the magnetic\nforce. The 20 \u00d7 4 mm central strip is held in position by two thin arms, which\nconstitute the elastic twistable element. This cantilever is obtained by spark erosion on a 50 \u03bcm thick copper-beryllium (CuBe) foil, subsequently annealed at\n315 \u25e6 C for two hours in order to eliminate the mechanical stress and obtain a\nperfectly flat foil. The sample, mixed with Apiezon N grease for thermal contact,\nis placed at one extremity of the balance, which constitutes the upper plate of\nthe capacitor. The lower plate is obtained from a square copper pad on a printed\ncircuit board. The CuBe foil is held by two brass clamps screwed onto the base,\nwith the interposition of 25 \u03bcm thick copper spacers. The clamps have transversal grooves in correspondence with the torsion arms of the cantilever. To avoid\nthe premature touch of the cantilever on the counterelectrode, we typically put\ntwo spacers on top of each other. Pads with the same shape as the spacers are\n\n\f32\n\nExperimental techniques\n\na\n\nb\n\n(a) Brass clamp for thermal post\n(b) Brass clamp for radiation shield\n(c) Copper radiation shield\n(d) Brass clamps for CuBe foil\n(e) Transversal grooves\n(f) Copper strip for thermal contact\n\nc\n\n(g) Sample\n(h) CuBe foil\n(i) Torsion cantilever\n(j) Cigarette paper impregnated\nwith GE varnish\n(k) Copper spacers\n(l) Soldering pads for coax cables\n\nd\n\n(m) Counterelectrode\n(n) Printed circuit board\n(o) Thermal anchoring post\n\ng\nf\n\ne\n\n(p) Copper strip to ground the back\nof the printed circuit board\n(q) Araldite base\n\nh\ni\n\nj\n\nk\nl\n\nm\n\nn\n\no\np\n\nq\n\nl\n\nFig. 2.15 : Drawing of the disassembled torque magnetometer.\n\n\f2.5. Torque magnetometer\n\n33\n\ndrawn on the printed circuit board; their function is to thermalize the system\nand to contact electrically the CuBe foil to a coax cable soldered on the board.\nSince the cantilever constitutes one of the plates of the capacitor and may not be\nconnected to the electrical ground, a L-shaped copper strip is screwed on top of\na thermal anchoring post, obtained from teh printed circuit board. A cigarette\npaper impregnated with GE varnish is inserted between the copper strip and\nthe anchoring post, to provide good thermal contact while maintaining electrical\ninsulation. The copper strip is then screwed laterally between the Araldite base\nand the cold finger. To shield the sample from thermal radiation and electromagnetic noise we cover the system with a copper box, coated with thin Kapton tape,\nscrewed laterally to the cold finger and therefore also connected to the electrical\nground. To complete the shielding, a small copper strip connects the front to the\nback side of the printed circuit board, which is completely copper-plated.\nTwo coaxial cables are soldered to copper pads on the printed circuit board,\none connected to the counterelectrode, the other to the cantilever. We can therefore measure the capacitance between cantilever and counterelectrode by connecting the coaxials to a General Radio 1615-A capacitance bridge. A Stanford\nSR830 lock-in amplifier provides the 5 V, \u223c 1 kHz excitation, and measures\nthe unbalance of the bridge. The measurements are controlled by a LabView\nprogram developed by W. G. J. Angenent. Before starting a field-sweep, the\ntemperature is set to the desired value, then the voltage due to the unbalance of\nthe capacitance bridge at zero-field is accurately measured, in order to subtract it\nfrom the data afterwards. While sweeping the magnetic field, typically at a rate\ndB/dt = 0.05 \u2212 0.1 T/min, the lock-in voltage VL is measured and divided by\nB after subtraction of the zero-field offset. This yields the sample magnetization\nM (B) \u221d \u03bc(B), since VL \u221d \u2206C [cf. Eq. (2.34)]. The exact conversion factor\nbetween the lock-in voltage and the magnetization is very difficult to obtain in a\nreliable and reproducible way(8) ; we shall therefore express M in the \"electrical\nunits\" \u03bcV/T.\n\n2.5.3\n\nPerformance\n\nAn example of the performance of our torquemeter is given by the experiment on\na \u223c 0.25 mg Cerium Magnesium Nitrate (CMN) sample, which is an ideal Curie\nparamagnet down to at least T \u223c 10 mK.\nThe measured magnetization, shown in Fig. 2.16(a), exhibits the expected\nBrillouin behavior up to a certain threshold, where the non-linear terms in (2.33)\nstart to be important. The condition of linear response \u2206C \u221d \u2206z is obeyed below\na certain maximum displacement, i.e. a horizontal line in the VL \u2212B plane, which\ntranslates into a hyperbola in the M \u2212 B plane.\n(8)\nIt depends for instance on the precise position of the sample on the platelet (r), the distance\nat rest between the capacitor plates (d0 ), etc.\n\n\f34\n\nExperimental techniques\n400\n\n600\n\n(a)\n\n0.15 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8\n\n1\n\n500\n\n(b)\n\n2\n\n\u03c7 (\u03bcV / T )\n\nM (\u03bcV / T)\n\n300\n1.5\n\n200\n\n2\n3\n4\n\n100\n\n400\n300\n200\n100\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\nB (T)\n\n3\n\n4\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n-1\n\n6\n\n8\n\n1 / T (K )\n\nFig. 2.16 : (a) Magnetization of a 0.25 mg CMN sample, at the indicated\ntemperatures (in Kelvin).

(b) Static susceptibility as a function of the inverse temperature, fitted by\nthe Curie law.\nBy fitting the initial linear part of M (B) at different temperatures, we obtain\nthe static susceptibility \u03c7(T ). As shown in Fig. 2.16(b), the measured susceptibility obeys indeed the Curie law, \u03c7 \u221d 1/T , and confirms the proper thermalization\nof the sample.\nKnowing that the magnetization of CMN is \u2243 3.3 emu/g at B = 1 T and T = 1\nK (as deduced from Fig. 14 in [41]), we can estimate that the linear response\nregion is roughly \u03bc * B < 2 * 10\u22123 emu*T. The instrumental noise, typically \u223c 10\nnV, translates into an equivalent noise of \u223c 10\u22127 emu in the magnetic moment\nat B = 1 T. By increasing the field to e.g. 10 T, another order of magnitude\nis gained in the equivalent magnetic noise, but the maximum measurable signal\nis also 10 times smaller. Therefore, the appropriate amount of sample must be\nchosen with care, as a function of the range of B and \u03bc of interest.\n\n\f35\n\nIII\nTheoretical aspects of molecular\nmagnetism\n\nThis chapter contains a selection of theoretical approaches necessary to understand the physics of molecular magnets and their interaction with the environment. After an introduction to the relevance of this subject for the extrapolation\nof quantum mechanics to the large scale, we proceed to a \"top-down\" physical\ndescription, starting from the model for a single giant spin in its crystalline environment, then illustrating the effect of a magnetic field and the coupling to\nnuclear spins and the mutual coupling via dipolar fields. We then discuss the\nstandard theory of the nuclear spin dynamics, mainly to show that such a treatment is no longer adequate in the presence of macroscopic quantum tunneling:\nthe Prokof'ev-Stamp theory is the necessary approach to a unified description of\na giant quantum spin coupled to a spin bath. One of the most crucial outcomes\nof the present work is that even the Prokof'ev-Stamp theory needs an extension\nin order to account for our experimental results presented in chapter IV. We shall\ntherefore come back to this issue in an extra theoretical section at the end of that\nchapter.\n\n3.1\n\nMacroscopic quantum phenomena\n\nBesides the perspective of possible applications (magnetic recording media, spin\nqubits, etc.), single-molecule magnets are very attractive systems to study the\nobservability of quantum phenomena at the macroscopic scale. The motivation\nbehind this interest dates back to the formulation of the Schr\u00f6dinger cat paradox [4] and the so-called \"measurement problem\" in quantum mechanics. In fact,\nthe \"weak point\" of quantum mechanics in its present formulation is the rather\nartificial distinction between the (microscopic) quantum system and the (macroscopic) measurement apparatus, which is supposed to obey the laws of classical\nphysics, and whose action forces the wave function of the quantum system to\nbe projected (collapse) onto one of its eigenstates. Nothing is specified about\nwhere the border between a microscopic (quantum) and a macroscopic (classical) system lies, neither how the collapse of the wave function actually takes\nplace. The proposals to solve these problems range from the most pragmatic idea\nof decoherence [9], all the way to theories that effectively add extra postulates\n\n\f36\n\nTheoretical aspects of molecular magnetism\n\nto the standard quantum mechanics [42, 43]. Before one even attempts to use\nthe experimental observations on SMMs to elucidate the fundamental problems\nmentioned above, it is essential to quantify the degree of \"Schr\u00f6dinger cattiness\"\nof the quantum states being observed. Here we briefly review the approach of\nLeggett [44, 10], who usefully introduces two parameters to quantify the macroscopicity of a quantum superposition of states: the \"extensive difference\" and the\n\"disconnectivity\".\n\n3.1.1\n\nExtensive difference\n\nLet us consider a system in a quantum superposition of states, i.e. whose wave\nfunction |\u03c8i can be expressed as a linear combination of two wave functions:\n|\u03c8i = a|\u03c8a i + b|\u03c8b i,\n\n(3.1)\n\nwith the assumption that |\u03c8a i and |\u03c8b i represent states of the system which are\nby some reasonable criterion \"classically different\". We may therefore characterize the two branches of the superposition by some extensive quantities {i} (e.g.\ncharge, magnetic moment, position of the center of mass, etc.) which should\nbe considerably different in the states |\u03c8a i and |\u03c8b i. Next, we define \u039bi as the\ndifference between the values of the extensive quantity i in the two branches of\nthe superposition, divided by a \"typical value\" of i at the atomic scale (e.g. 1\nelectron charge, 1 Bohr magneton, 1 \u00c5ngstrom, etc.). The \"extensive difference\"\n\u039b of the quantum superposition is then the maximum value assumed among the\n\u039bi 's.\nThis sounds at first as a very natural definition of macroscopic distinctness,\nbut in fact it's easy to find examples where \u039b is a very large number, although\nthe system is not what one would like to call \"macroscopic\". Think of a neutron\npassing through an interferometer with arms e.g. 10 cm apart: one finds \u039b \u223c 109 ,\nalthough this is clearly not the sort of examples we are looking for as a challenge\nto the interpretations of quantum mechanics.\n\n3.1.2\n\nDisconnectivity\n\nLeggett introduces therefore another parameter, D, called \"disconnectivity\". The\nprecise definition can be found in Ref. [44], but for our purpose it is sufficient to\nsay that D is the number of particles that have substantially different behavior in\nthe states |\u03c8a i and |\u03c8b i. More precisely, D is the number of particle correlations\nthat must be measured in order to distinguish the coherent superposition |\u03c8i\nfrom a statistical mixture of |\u03c8a i and |\u03c8b i. For instance, a system of N identical\nparticles prepared in a state like\n|\u03c8i = a|\u03c8a iN + b|\u03c8b iN\n\n(3.2)\n\n\f3.2. Effective Spin Hamiltonian\n\n37\n\nhas D = N , since N particles are simultaneously superimposed, whereas a state\n|\u03c8i = (a|\u03c8a i + b|\u03c8b i)N\n\n(3.3)\n\nhas D = 1, being just the product of one-particle superpositions. The abovementioned neutron in a diffractometer has obviously D = 1, thereby reestablishing the fact that it does not constitute a \"true\" macroscopic quantum state.\nAn interesting example is the one of a superconductor: it's easy to realize that\nD = 2, since the standard BCS wave function is a product of two-particle correlations. The \"charge qubit\" [45], which is one of the most exciting developments\nin solid-state quantum devices of the last few years, again has D = 2 since it is\nbased on the superposition of a Cooper pair (2 particles) being inside or outside\na superconducting island; the fact that the device itself has a size \u223c 1 \u03bcm does\nnot automatically make it relevant for the problem of quantum mechanics at the\nlarge scale!\nThe observation of high-D quantum superpositions has been realized only very\nrecently: for instance, by diffraction of C60 molecules [46] a value of D = 1048 has\nbeen achieved. Even higher values have been reached by the \"flux-qubit\" [17,47],\nwhich features the superposition of counter-rotating supercurrents in a SQUID\nloop: in this case all the current-carrying Cooper pairs (i.e. those within the\nLondon penetration depth from the surface) are behaving differently in the two\nbranches, yielding D > 106 !\n\n3.1.3\n\nMacroscopicity of a single-molecule magnet\n\nWe can now apply the concepts defined above to the case of a SMM. In general, we\nwill be interested in phenomena that arise from the quantum superposition of two\ndifferent projections of the total spin along the z axis . For example, for Mn12 -ac\nthe total spin S = 10 can give rise to a total magnetic moment of 20 \u03bcB pointing\nalong +~z or \u2212~z. A superposition of such two states would be characterized by an\nextensive difference \u039b = 40. As for the disconnectivity, we anticipate (see \u00a73.2.4)\nthat the total spin of the molecule is the result of the ferrimagnetic coupling of\n8 Mn3+ ions with spin s = 2, i.e. 4 electron spins per ion, and 4 Mn4+ ions with\ns = 3/2 (3 electrons). In total, the number of electrons having different states\n~ is along +~z or \u2212~z is D = 4 \u00d7 8 + 3 \u00d7 4 = 44. Although it doesn't reach\nwhen S\nthe macroscopicity of a fullerene molecule or a SQUID qubit, a SMM is therefore\nsubstantially more macroscopic that an atomic-size quantum system.\n\n3.2\n\nEffective Spin Hamiltonian\n\nThe magnetic properties of the single-molecule magnets investigated in this thesis are determined in the first place by the net electron spin of each single ion,\narising from the partial filling of 3d shells. Because of the strong crystal field\n\n\f38\n\nTheoretical aspects of molecular magnetism\n\neffects, the electron angular momentum is quenched, so that no orbital contribution needs to be included. Furthermore, the electron spins within a cluster are\nmagnetically coupled by superexchange interactions, typically due to the orbital\noverlap through oxygen bridges. In this way, one obtains a magnetic ground state\nwhich can be characterized by a high value of the total cluster spin S, like in the\ncase of Mn12 -ac and Mn6 , and is separated from other spin states by an energy\ndetermined by the strength of the intracluster superexchange couplings. As long\nas the temperature is kept much lower than the energy separation between the\nground and the first excited total spin state, it is very convenient to adopt the\neffective spin Hamiltonian description, which means that the cluster is treated as\nan object characterized by just the number of energy levels compatible with the\ntotal spin ground state, i.e. 2S + 1. The resulting energy levels can be further\nsplit by the effect of crystal field anisotropy or couplings with magnetic fields. A\ntypical effective spin Hamiltonian to describe the crystal field anisotropy is the\nfollowing:\n4\n4\n).\n+ S\u2212\nHCFA = \u2212DSz2 \u2212 BSz4 + E(Sx2 \u2212 Sy2 ) + C(S+\n\n(3.4)\n\nIn the next subsections we shall discuss which predictions about the physical\nbehavior of a single-molecule magnet can be made on basis of the above Hamiltonian.\n\n3.2.1\n\nSuperparamagnetic blocking\n\nThe terms \u2212DSz2 and \u2212BSz4 (with |B| \u226a |D|, typically) represent uniaxial\nanisotropies: if D > 0, then z is the easy axis of magnetization. In manganesebased clusters the uniaxial anisotropy typically arises from the Jahn-Teller distortion of the coordination octahedra at Mn3+ sites; the total cluster anisotropy\nis then obtained as the vector sum of the single-ion anisotropies [48]. Notice that\nby considering only these two terms, HCFA commutes with the Sz operator, thus\nthe eigenstates |mi of Sz are also exact eigenstates of HCFA . The energy levels\nscheme, as shown in the left panel of Fig. 3.1, can be regarded as a set of doublets\nof degenerate states, | + mi and | \u2212 mi, with energies E+m = E\u2212m , each state\nbeing localized on the left or right side of the anisotropy barrier of height U . At\ntemperatures comparable with the barrier height, thermally activated transitions\nfrom one side to the other are very fast, and the molecule behaves as a high-spin\nparamagnet. Since the high spin results from several ions behaving collectively\nas a single-domain particle, the system is called superparamagnet [49]. The relaxation rate by thermal activation, \u03c4 \u22121 , depends on temperature according to\nthe Arrhenius law:\n\u03c4 \u22121 = \u03c40\u22121 exp(\u2212U/kB T ).\n\n(3.5)\n\nAt sufficiently low temperatures, \u03c4 \u22121 may become exceedingly long and give rise\nto hysteresis in the magnetization loops [2] and the appearance of a frequency-\n\n\f3.2.

These terms do not commute with Sz ,\nso the eigenstates |\u03c8i of the complete HCFA are no longer a set of doublets of\nlocalized states (Fig. 3.1).

As we shall discuss below, the coupling with\nenvironmental degrees of freedom is many orders of magnitude larger than \u2206,\nwhich basically eliminates the possibility to observe coherent tunneling oscillations as described in Eq. (3.9). One of the great advantages of single-molecules\nmagnets as systems to study macroscopic quantum effects, is that the parameters\nof the spin Hamiltonian, and thereby the whole physical properties, can be easily\n~ This introduces an extra\nmanipulated by applying an external magnetic field B.\nterm in the effective spin Hamiltonian:\n~ * B.\n~\nH = HCF A \u2212 g\u03bcB S\n\n(3.10)\n\n~ with respect to the anisotropy axis ~z, we have\nBy choosing the direction of B\n~ \u22a5 ~z) that enhance\nthe freedom to either introduce extra non-diagonal terms (B\nthe quantum behavior, or to destroy the symmetry of the energy level scheme\n\n\f3.2.

If \u03be(t) spans a range much larger than \u2206 but\ncrosses several times through the tunneling resonance, one finds that at each\ncrossing there is a nonzero probability for the cluster spin to tunnel through the\nbarrier, but there is no correlation between subsequent tunneling events; therefore\nthis is called \"incoherent tunneling\". The probability PLZ of a single tunneling\nevent upon crossing through the tunneling resonance can be calculated with the\nLandau-Zener formula [52]:\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2212\u03c0\u22062\n.\n(3.11)\nPLZ = 1 \u2212 exp\n2~d\u03be(t)/dt\nA sketch of a Landau-Zener transition is given in Fig. 3.2. This phenomenon has\nbeen successfully exploited as a way to extract the tunneling splitting [53, 54] by\nsweeping an external magnetic field through the tunneling resonance. As will be\ndiscussed below, the Landau-Zener formalism can also be used to describe the\ncoupling between a single cluster spin and its environment, since very often the\neffect of environmental fluctuations can be treated as an effective magnetic field\nthat couples to the cluster spin.\nIn the presence of incoherent tunneling fluctuations, it is essential to distinguish between the average time interval \u03c4T between subsequent uncorrelated tunneling events, and the so-called tunneling traversal time \u03c4tr , which is in our case\nthe timescale for the reversal of the cluster spin. A detailed analysis of the tunneling traversal time constitutes a topic on itself [55,56,57], but for our purposes\n\n\f42\n\nTheoretical aspects of molecular magnetism\n\n\u03c4T\n\n\u03c4tr \u223c \u03a90-1\nt\n\n\u0004 \u03a90\n\nFig. 3.3 : Illustration of the relationship between tunneling traversal time \u03c4tr ,\nbounce frequency \u03a90 and tunneling interval \u03c4T for incoherent tunneling of the\ncluster spin.\nit is sufficient to estimate the order of magnitude of \u03c4tr . In the general framework\nof the semiclassical instanton technique [6, 58], \u03c4tr is related to the inverse of the\n\"bounce frequency\" or \"attempt frequency\" \u03a90 , i.e. the frequency of the small\noscillations at the bottom of each potential well. In SMMs ~\u03a90 is of the order of\nthe energy separation between the two lowest electron spin doublets, as shown in\n\u221212\nFig. 3.3. For instance in Mn12 -ac we have ~\u03a90 \u223c 10 K, thus \u03c4tr \u223c \u03a9\u22121\n0 \u223c 10\ns. This means that the tunneling events take place in a virtually instantaneous\nway, as compared to the timescale of all other relevant phenomena.\nIn order to push the system into a regime where coherent tunneling may\ntake place, it is necessary to increase \u2206 above the strength of the coupling with\nenvironmental degrees of freedom. This can be done by applying a magnetic field\nB\u22a5 perpendicular to the anisotropy axis. Although sophisticated calculations of\n\u2206(B\u22a5 ) have been proposed [59, 60], it is often more practical to obtain \u2206(B\u22a5 )\ndirectly from the numerical diagonalization of the spin Hamiltonian. An example\nof the resulting \u2206(B\u22a5 ) in the case of Mn12 -ac is shown in Fig. 3.4. A simplified\n~ has been\nexpression for \u2206(B\u22a5 ), based on the Hamiltonian H = \u2212DSz2 \u2212g\u03bcB B~\u22a5 *S,\nobtained in the limit g\u03bcB B\u22a5 \u226a DS and S \u226b 1 by Korenblit and Shender [61]:\n4\n\u2206(B\u22a5 ) \u2248 \u221a DS 3/2\n\u03c0\n\n\u0012\n\neg\u03bcB B\u22a5\n4DS\n\n\u00132S\n\n,\n\n(3.12)\n\nwhere e is the base of the natural logarithm.

The two lines refer to B\n\u25e6\noriented at 45 between them.\nFrom Eq. (3.13) it is also clear that, since g\u03bcB B\u22a5 \u226a DS, the tunneling splitting increases drastically (exponentially, in fact) when higher excited doublets\n(i.e. with lower |m|) are considered(1) . Therefore, in the presence of thermal\nexcitations, tunneling can more easily proceed through excited doublets than\nthrough the ground state. This remains true in zero external field, although the\ntunneling splitting is produced by non-diagonal anisotropy terms. The details\nof the mechanism of thermally-assisted tunneling have generated a vast literature [63, 64, 65, 66, 67], since a large majority of experiments on SMMs have been\ncarried out in the temperature regime T > 1.5 K, where tunneling through excited states is essential. The transition to pure ground state tunneling happens\nindeed at temperatures that, at a first sight, appear surprisingly low. The point\nis that, although the Boltzmann factors for the population of excited doublets\nare exponentially small, \u2206m grows exponentially upon excitations to higher doublets (3.13), so the competition between the two exponents cannot be treated in\na trivial way [68]. Since the present work is focused on the ultra-low temperature regime, the topic of thermally assisted tunneling will be touched upon only\nmarginally.\n(1)\n\nFor the case of a SMM in zero external field, the role of B\u22a5 in (3.13) is taken by the nondiagonal crystal-field anisotropy terms and by the transverse component of the dipolar field from\nneighboring molecules. By condensing such effects into an \"equivalent B\u22a5 \" of constant value,\nit is easy to see that \u2206m \u221d f (m) * (const.)2m\n\n\f44\n\nTheoretical aspects of molecular magnetism\n\nz\n\n(a)\n\nSz\n\n(b)\n-10\n\n-5\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n0\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n(K)\n\n1\n\n-10\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1\n3\n2\n\n-20\n\n-30\n\n-40\n\n-50\n\n-60\n\nTh-A T\n\nQT\n\nh\nS-P\n\n3\n\nEnergy\n\n3\n\n-70\n\nFig. 3.5 : (a) Structure of the Mn12 -ac cluster, with the labelling of the three\ninequivalent Mn sites as described in the text.

The non-diagonal terms allow transitions between states on opposite sides of the anisotropy barrier by means of quantum tunneling (QT). In the\npresence of intrawell transitions induced by thermal excitation, thermally assisted\nquantum tunneling (Th-A T) between excited doublets can also take place .\n\n3.2.4\n\nParameters for Mn12 -ac\n\nThe structure of the [Mn12 O12 (O2 CMe)16 (H2 O)4 ] (Mn12 -ac) cluster [69] (Fig.\n3.5) contains a core of 4 Mn4+ ions with electron spin s = 3/2, which we shall\ndenote as Mn(1) , and 8 Mn3+ ions (s = 2) on two inequivalent crystallographic\nsites, Mn(2) and Mn(3) . The electron spins are coupled by mutual superexchange\ninteractions, the strongest being the antiferromagnetic interaction between Mn(1)\nand Mn(2) [70]. The molecules crystallize in a tetragonal structure with lattice\nparameters a = b = 17.319 \u00c5and c = 12.388 \u00c5. Numerical studies have shown\nthe influence of the magnitude and sign of the exchange constants on the precise\nenergy level structure of the cluster [71], and an attempt has been made to verify\nthe assignment of the exchange interactions by a spin-wave analysis of the nuclear\nspin-lattice relaxation rate in the thermally activated regime [72]. The ground\nstate of the molecule has a total electron spin S = 10 and is separated from\nthe first excited manifold S = 9 by \u223c 58 K, according to neutron scattering\nexperiments [73]. For the temperature range of interest in the present work\n(T < 2 K), we may therefore describe the electron spin of the cluster by means\n\n\f3.2. Effective Spin Hamiltonian\n\n45\n\nof the spin Hamiltonian in the S = 10 manifold:\n4\n4\n~ * g * S.\n~\nH = \u2212DSz2 \u2212 BSz4 + C(S+\n+ S\u2212\n) + \u03bcB B\n\n(3.14)\n\nWe adopt the parameter values D = 0.548 K, B = 1.17 \u00d7 10\u22123 K and C =\n2.2 \u00d7 10\u22125 K as obtained by neutron scattering data [74], and for the g tensor the\nvalues gk = 1.93 and g\u22a5 = 1.96 from high-frequency EPR(2) [75]. The uniaxial\nanisotropy terms \u2212DSz2 and \u2212BSz4 can be attributed to the single-ion anisotropy\nof the Mn3+ ions [75], which is due to the crystal field effects resulting in the\nJahn-Teller distortions of the coordination octahedra, where the elongation axes\nare approximately parallel to the \u0109-axis of the crystal. The energy levels scheme\nis then a series of doublets of degenerate states which are separated by a barrier\nwith a total height DS 2 + BS 4 \u2243 66.6 K. The non-diagonal anisotropy term\n4 + S 4 ) arises from the fourfold S point symmetry of the molecule, and is\nC(S+\n4\n\u2212\nthe lowest order term that would allow the quantum tunneling of the electron\nspin between states Sz = \u00b1m. An external magnetic field Bz parallel to the\nanisotropy axis would introduce an extra term gk \u03bcB Bz Sz in the Hamiltonian,\nthereby destroying the symmetry of the energy level scheme; at the particular\n\u2032\nvalues of field Bzmm = [n/(gk \u03bcB )][D + B(m2 + m\u20322 )], with n an integer \u2212S \u2264 n \u2264\nS, the states Sz = m on one side of the barrier come in resonance with the states\nSz = m\u2032 = n \u2212 m on the opposite side. In the presence of nondiagonal terms\nin the spin Hamiltonian, one then expects the occurrence of quantum tunneling\nof the magnetization, as indeed observed in the experiments [8]. The selection\n4 + S 4 ) imply that resonant tunneling should\nrules imposed by the term C(S+\n\u2212\nbe observed only for n a multiple of 4, in contrast with the observation that\nsteps of comparable height appear in the magnetic hysteresis loops for all values\nof n. There is now solid experimental evidence [77, 78] for the prediction [79]\nthat a disorder in the acetic acid of crystallization is present and gives rise to\nsix different isomers of Mn12 cluster, four of which have symmetry lower than\ntetragonal and therefore possess non-diagonal anisotropy terms that would allow\ntunneling transitions for any even value of n. Furthermore, to obtain tunneling\nresonances also at odd values of n, it is necessary to introduce in (3.14) the\neffect of dipolar fields originating from neighboring molecules and the hyperfine\ncouplings with the nuclear spins, as will be described below.\nA peculiarity of the Mn12 -ac system is the presence in every real sample\nof fast-relaxing molecules (FRMs) [80], i.e. clusters characterized by a lower\nanisotropy barrier and a much faster relaxation rate, as observed for instance by\nac-susceptibility [81] and magnetization measurements [82]. It has been recognized that such FRMs originate from Jahn-Teller isomerism [83], i.e. the presence\nin the molecule of one or two Mn3+ sites where the elongated Jahn-Teller axis\n(2)\n\nThe anisotropy parameters obtained by EPR seem to depend on the magnetic field range\nused in the experiment [75, 76], whereas neutron scattering is a zero-field experiment, and does\nnot require assumptions on the g tensor in order to fit the data.\n\n\f46\n\nTheoretical aspects of molecular magnetism\n\nFig. 3.6 : (a) Crystal structure of Mn6 O4 Br4 (Et2 dbm)6 [85].

This results in the reduction of the anisotropy barrier to 35 or 15 K in\ncase of one or two flipped Jahn-Teller axes, respectively [84], and presumably in\nan increase of the non-diagonal terms in the spin Hamiltonian as well. Furthermore, the anisotropy axis z of the whole molecules no longer coincides with the\ncrystallographic \u0109-axis, but deviates e.g. by \u223c 10\u25e6 in the molecules with 35 K barrier [82]. The Jahn-Teller isomerism is very different from the above-mentioned\neffect of disorder in solvent molecules, and produces much more important effects.\nAs shall become clear in chapter IV, the presence of the FRMs is essential for the\ninterpretation of our experimental data.\n\n3.2.5\n\nParameters for Mn6\n\nThe molecular core of Mn6 O4 Br4 (Et2 dbm)6 , hereafter abbreviated as Mn6 [85],\nis a highly symmetric octahedron of Mn3+ ions (with spin s = 2) that are ferromagnetically coupled via strong intra-cluster superexchange interactions (Fig.\n3.6). Accordingly, the ground state is a S = 12 multiplet and the energy of the\nnearest excited state is approximately 150 K higher. The unit cell is monoclinic,\nwith space group Pc and contains 4 molecules(3) bound together only by Van\n(3)\nWe have used the crystallographic data for a related complex Mn6 O4 Cl4 (Et2 dbm)6 [85], in\nwhich the Br\u2212 ions are replaced by Cl\u2212 .\n\n\f3.3. Hyperfine couplings\n\n47\n\nder Waals forces. Inter-cluster superexchange is therefore negligible and the only\nrelevant interaction interaction between cluster spins is the dipolar one.\nTo determine the spin Hamiltonian of the S = 12 manifold, we notice that\nthe anisotropy of the single Mn3+ ions may be very strong due to Jahn-Teller\neffects. On the other hand, due to the highly symmetric octahedral structure of\nthe cluster, the addition of the single-ion anisotropies may lead to a vanishingly\nsmall net cluster anisotropy, no matter how large is the zero-field splitting of the\nconstituting atoms [48]. Indeed, the analysis of magnetization data on basis of\nthe simple Hamiltonian:\n~ * S.\n~\nH = \u2212DSz2 \u2212 g\u03bcB B\n\n(3.15)\n\nindicated an upper limit |D| . 0.01K for the total cluster anisotropy [85], with\ng \u2243 1.94 \u2212 1.98. An independent estimate of D was obtained by high-frequency\nESR data taken in the range 95 \u2212 380 GHz by J. Krzystek (NHMFL Tallahassee,\nUSA) [86]. Owing to the combination of very small D and large S, as well as the\npresence of a signal at g = 2.00 arising from a minute amount of Mn2+ impurity\n(often seen in ESR of Mn3+ compounds), the interpretation of the spectra was\nnot fully conclusive. Nevertheless, signals with a clearly visible structure on the\nlow-field end of the spectra could be obtained. It could be identified as fine\nstructure originating from zero-field splitting (ZFS), since it was independent of\nfield and frequency. Simulations of the spectra performed using Eq. (3.15) agree\nwell with the experiment taking |D|/kB \u223c 0.03 or \u223c 0.05 K, depending on the\nsign of D (which could not be unequivocally determined). Although a smaller\nrhombic component could be present, the data do not justify a more elaborate\nfitting.\nThe Mn6 cluster constitutes therefore a practical example of how the anisotropy\nparameters of high-spin molecules can be tuned by simply modifying the crystal\nstructure, while maintaining the same constituents as other clusters having very\ndifferent properties (cf. Mn12 -ac in \u00a73.2.4).\n\n3.3\n\nHyperfine couplings\n\nThe coupling between electron and nuclear spins in a single ion can be generally\nexpressed in the form:\n~ hyp\nHhyp = I~ * A * ~s = \u2212\u03b3N ~I~ * B\n\n(3.16)\n\nwhere I~ is the nuclear spin, ~s is the electron spin of the single ion, A is the\n~ hyp is the\nhyperfine coupling tensor, \u03b3N is the nuclear gyromagnetic ratio and B\ntotal hyperfine field at the nucleus. The hyperfine tensor can contain several\ncontributions depending on the particular nuclear site under consideration.

For the 1 H\nnuclei, located at the ligands of the molecules, the main contribution is instead\narising from the dipolar field produced by the electron spins. The resulting Bhyp\nis then typically much smaller than for 55 Mn.\n\n3.3.1\n\nHyperfine fields on the\n\n55\n\nMn nuclei in Mn12 -ac\n\nThanks to the high anisotropy barrier of Mn12 -ac, it is possible to detect the\nLarmor precession of 55 Mn nuclear spins even in the absence of an external field,\nby exploiting the local hyperfine field from the electron spins which, below the\nblocking temperature TB \u223c 3 K of the superparamagnetic clusters, is static on\nthe timescale of an NMR experiment. Goto et al. [88] were the first to find\nthat the 55 Mn NMR spectrum in zero field consists of three quadrupolar-split\nlines centered around 230, 280 and 365 MHz. The hyperfine fields in each of\nthe three inequivalent Mn sites are directly obtained as Bhyp = 2\u03c0\u03bd/\u03b3N , where\n\u03b3N /2\u03c0 = 10.57 MHz/T is the gyromagnetic ratio of the 55 Mn nuclei, yielding\n(3)\n(2)\n(1)\nBhyp = 21.8 T, Bhyp = 26.5 T and Bhyp = 34.5 T. Subsequently, a detailed\nanalysis of the hyperfine couplings has been reported by Kubo et al.

Furthermore, B\nspin, but there's a small canting angle [87]. Accounting for the effects of a dipolar\ncontribution to the hyperfine field in Mn3+ , it was then possible to assign the line\nat \u03bd (2) \u2243 280 MHz to the Mn(2) site and the line \u03bd (3) \u2243 365 MHz to the Mn(3)\n(2)\nsite [87] (cf. Fig. 3.7). The quadrupolar splittings of these lines are \u2206\u03bdQ \u2243 4.3\n(3)\n\nMHz and \u2206\u03bdQ \u2243 2.9 MHz\nThe structure mentioned above is reflected in the effect on the NMR fre~ z applied along the anisotropy axis.

[90] have analyzed the 55 Mn NMR spectrum of Mn12 -ac\nin perpendicular fields by assuming that the canting angle \u03b8 between the direction\nof the electron spins and the c-axis of the molecules is given by sin \u03b8 = M\u22a5 /Ms ,\nwhere Ms is the saturation magnetization of the S = 10 ground state, and M\u22a5\nis the component of the magnetization along the field direction. At the very low\ntemperatures involved in the present work the contribution of excited electron\nspin states to the total magnetization is negligible, and the above approach is\nequivalent to expressing the canting angle as(4) :\nsin \u03b8 =\n\nhSx i\n,\n10\n\n(3.17)\n\nwhere hSx i = h\u03c8G |Sx |\u03c8G i is the expectation value of the x-component of the\nspin in the ground state |\u03c8G i, to be obtained by numerical diagonalization of\n~ to lie at an\nthe Hamiltonian (3.14). There's no difficulty in allowing the field B\narbitrary angle \u03b8B with respect to ~z, which helps accounting for the possibility\nof misalignments between external field an crystal axes.

(3.18) and (3.19) assuming \u03b8B = 90\u25e6 exactly. For\ncomparison, we also plot the Larmor frequency of 1 H.\nto 10 at all fields. By diagonalizing the Hamiltonian (3.14) one finds that this is\nthe case only if the external field is not exactly perpendicular to ~z plane but has\n(e.g. due to a small misalignment with respect to the crystal axes) a longitudinal\ncomponent Bz . This yields a bias \u03be = 2g\u03bcB Sz Bz which forces the eigenstates of\n(3.14) to localize at one side or the other of the anisotropy barrier, whereas with\na perfect perpendicular field (\u03b8B = 90\u25e6 ) the eigenstates of (3.14) are delocalized\nover both sides of the barrier and yield hSz i = 0, thus S = hSx i. As a rule of\nthumb, one obtains S = 10 when \u03be > \u2206, and hSz i = 0, S \u2248 hSx i otherwise. In\nfact, in zero external field (\u03be = 0) all the eigenstates of (3.14) have S = 0, which\nwould lead to Bhyp (0) = 0, contrary to the experimental findings. The solution to\nthis paradox is in the fact that the Hamiltonian (3.14) refers to a single, isolated\nmolecule. For a realistic description, we must take into account the fact that the\nclusters are embedded in a crystalline structure and interact with each other by\nintercluster dipolar coupling, producing bias fields that act on the electron spin\nlevels.\n\n3.4\n\nDipolar fields\n\nIn a real sample consisting of a lattice of identical clusters, each molecule is also\n~ dip created by its neighbors, which adds a term\nsubject to the dipolar field B\n~\n~\n\u2212g\u03bcB S * Bdip in the Hamiltonian.

Whereas the FC distribution is asymmetric and\nobviously depends on the size and shape of the crystal, the ZFC distribution can\nbe well approximated by a gaussian with width 2\u03c3dip \u2243 0.042 T. In practice, this\nmeans that the vast majority of clusters is subject to a longitudinal bias \u03be \u223c 0.1\nK, several orders of magnitude greater than the tunneling splitting; diagonalizing\n~ dip yields indeed S = 10, as argued on basis\nthe Hamiltonian (3.14) including B\nof the observed hyperfine fields. Nevertheless, there remains the possibility to\nreduce the total spin to less than 10 by applying a perpendicular field strong\nenough to produce a tunneling splitting larger than the dipolar bias. The exact\nway in which \u2206 becomes greater than \u03be is a delicate problem that must be solved\nby self-consistent numerical iteration, because as soon as some molecules have a\nsmall enough bias to cause the spin to reduce from 10 to hSx i, also the dipolar\nfield they produce on their neighbors will suddenly be reduced, causing a drop in\n(5)\nThat is, not treating the cluster spin as a point dipole but considering the single atomic\nmoments.\n\n\f1\n\n53\n\n(a)\n\n100\n\n10\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\nFrequency (MHz)\n\n0.01\n320\n\nDipolar width (mT)\n\nEnergy (K)\n\n3.4.

It clearly appears that the deviation\nfrom the S = 10 spectrum occurs when \u2206 approaches the width of the dipolar\nfield distribution. An actual observation of such a peculiar spectrum would imply\nthat the total electron spin of the cluster is occupying a ground state consisting\nof a superposition of macroscopically distinct states for a time longer than the\nintrinsic NMR timescale, and that such a superposition of states is robust enough\nto survive the interaction with the environment and the measurement performed\nvia the nuclear\nP spins. To be completely correct, one should include the hyperfine\ninteraction i I~i *Ai *~si in the Hamiltonian (3.14) and solve the complete problem,\nbut the size of the matrices would become intractable. We notice anyway that the\nhyperfine interactions are of the same order of magnitude as the dipolar fields,\nthus we can empirically assume that their effect on the localization of the electron\nspins should not be much larger than what we calculated so far by considering\nonly Bdip .\n\n3.5\n3.5.1\n\nNuclear spin dynamics\nNuclear spin-lattice relaxation (NSLR)\n\nThe general theory of nuclear relaxation, which expresses the spin-lattice relaxation rate as a function of the time correlation of a perturbing field [91], has been\nsuccessfully applied to interpret the temperature dependence of the NSLR rate\nin the thermally activated regime of molecular magnets, first with proton NMR\nin Fe8 [92, 93, 94] and more recently with 55 Mn in Mn12 -ac [89, 95, 96]. We shall\nbriefly review it here, mainly to point out why it breaks down upon approaching the pure quantum regime for the electron spin fluctuations. The implicit\nassumption that has always been made [92, 93, 94, 89, 95, 96] is that the nuclear\nspins have a certain Zeeman splitting, thus a certain Larmor frequency \u03c9N , given\nby a static magnetic field, and that the transitions between the Zeeman levels of\nthe static Hamiltonian can be computed within perturbation theory, assuming\nthe presence of fluctuations in the hyperfine field which are small compared to\nthe static field. In most cases, as in the 1 H experiments on Mn12 -ac [92,93] (with\nthe exception of [94]), the static field is an externally applied field, much larger\nthan the hyperfine fields. For 55 Mn in Mn12 -ac however, the reverse is true and\none may carry out an NMR experiment exploiting the local hyperfine field alone,\n\n\f3.5. Nuclear spin dynamics\n\n55\n\nwhich is made \"quasi-static\" by the high anisotropy barrier for the reversal of the\nelectron spins. Thus, in the absence of an external field, the static field is just the\nvalue of Bhyp obtained when the electron spin is in its ground state. Fluctuations\nof the local field may then arise when the cluster spin is thermally excited to a\nhigher level. Calling b(t) the fluctuating component of Bhyp , the NSLR rate W\ncan still be computed within the framework of perturbation theory if b \u226a Bhyp .\nW is proportional to the spectral density at the Larmor frequency of the perpendicular component b\u22a5 (t) of the fluctuating field, i.e. the Fourier transform of the\ntime correlation function, hb\u22a5 (t)b\u22a5 (0)i:\n2 Z\n\u03b3N\nW =\nhb\u22a5 (t)b\u22a5 (0)i exp(i\u03c9N t)dt.\n(3.22)\n4\nWe may further assume that the correlation function of b\u22a5 (t) is related to the\n\u22121\nof the cluster electron spin as:\nphonon-induced fluctuation rate \u03c4s\u2212ph\nhb\u22a5 (t)b\u22a5 (0)i = h\u2206b2\u22a5 i exp(\u2212t/\u03c4s\u2212ph ).\n\n(3.23)\n\nHere h\u2206b2\u22a5 i is the square of the average change in the perpendicular component\nof the hyperfine field when the electron spin state is excited from m = \u00b110 to\n\u22121\nm = \u00b19. The spin-phonon transition rate \u03c4s\u2212ph\ndepends on the lifetime, \u03c49 ,\n\u22121\n=\nand the activation energy, \u2206E = E9 \u2212 E10 , of the m = \u00b19 states as \u03c4s\u2212ph\n\u22121\n\u03c49 exp(\u2212\u2206E/kB T ), where:\nCs\u2212ph \u2206E 3\n1\n.\n=\n\u03c49\n1 \u2212 exp(\u2212\u2206E/kB T )\n\n(3.24)\n\n\u03c49 incorporates therefore the spin-phonon coupling constant Cs\u2212ph [63, 67]. For\nthe purpose of the present discussion we may neglect the higher lying levels,\n|m| \u2265 8, which is a reasonable approximation below T \u223c 3 K since \u2206E > 10 K.\nInserting into Eq. (3.22) we find:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2\n\u03c4s\u2212ph\nh\u2206b2\u22a5 i \u22121\n\u03b3N\n\u2206E\n2\nh\u2206b\u22a5 i\n,\n(3.25)\n\u2248\nW =\n2 \u03c42\n2 \u03c49 exp \u2212 k T\n4\n1 + \u03c9N\n4Btot\nB\ns\u2212ph\nwhich shows clearly the expected exponential temperature dependence of the\nNSLR rate, since \u03c49 \u2243 const. for kB T \u226a \u2206E.\nEq. (3.25) has the same form as the expression used by Goto et al. [95], except\nthat the latter authors insert the T -dependence into an effective fluctuating field,\nexpressed as:\nbeff = \u2206b\u22a5\n\n\u03c49\n,\n\u03c410\n\nCs\u2212ph \u2206E 3\n1\n,\n=\n\u03c410\nexp(\u2206E/kB T ) \u2212 1\n\n(3.26)\n\n\f56\n\nTheoretical aspects of molecular magnetism\n\nwhere \u03c410 is the lifetime of the m = \u00b110 states, which is exponentially T dependent. Goto et al. also pointed out that, in order to obtain a transverse\ncomponent of the fluctuating hyperfine field upon excitation of the electron spin\nfrom m = \u00b110 to m = \u00b19, the hyperfine coupling tensor A (3.16) must contain non-vanishing off-diagonal terms. Then we may write b\u22a5 = \u2212\u03b4sz Axz /(\u03b3N ~),\nwhere \u03b4sz is the change in the z component of the electron spin in each single ion.\nAs mentioned in \u00a73.3.1, only 55 Mn nuclei in Mn3+ have Axz 6= 0 [87, 95], while\nA in Mn4+ sites is a diagonal tensor. We shall come back to the implications of\nthis remark in \u00a74.2.1 and \u00a74.2.4.\nAs will become clear from the experiments presented in \u00a74.2, although Eq.\n(3.25) properly fits the data in the thermally activated regime, it fails completely\nin the quantum regime (T < 0.8 K), where the NSLR is found to become nearly\nindependent of temperature. This phenomenon is observed in both the protonNMR experiments in Fe8 [94] and in our 55 Mn-NMR results, and clearly calls for\na different theoretical approach. As will be further argued in \u00a74.2, the NSLR in\nthe quantum regime can be ascribed to the hyperfine field fluctuations arising\nfrom incoherent quantum tunneling of the electron spin between the | + 10i and\n| \u2212 10i states. In this context, the crucial point is that the complete hyperfine\nfield acting on the 55 Mn nuclei in a certain molecule will be suddenly inverted\nwhen the electron spin of that molecule tunnels, and will stay like that until the\nnext tunneling event occurs. This means that a formalism such as that leading to\nEq. (3.25) is unsuitable for describing the 55 Mn relaxation produced by tunneling\nevents, because the effect of tunneling cannot be treated as a perturbation on a\nstatic Hamiltonian. As discussed in \u00a73.2.3, the inversion of the hyperfine field\n\u22121\n\u223c 10\u22129\ntakes place in a time \u03c4tr \u223c 10\u221212 s, i.e. instantaneous compared to \u03c9N\ns, whereas the interval \u03c4T between tunneling events is, as we shall show below,\nvery long compared to the NMR window. The description of the nuclear spin\ndynamics in the presence of incoherent tunneling requires therefore a completely\ndifferent approach, for which the basis has been laid by the Prokof'ev-Stamp\ntheory [14], which we shall review in \u00a73.6.\n\n3.5.2\n\nTransverse spin-spin relaxation (TSSR)\n\nAnother essential aspect of the nuclear spin dynamics is the transverse spin-spin\nrelaxation (TSSR). Under the same hypotheses as for the NSLR, Goto et al. [95]\nhave derived an expression for the TSSR rate T2\u22121 for the 55 Mn, that is applicable\nin the thermally activated regime of Mn12 -ac:\nT2\u22121 =\n\n(\u03b3N \u2206bz \u03c49 )2\n1\n\u00d7\n,\n\u03c410 1 + (\u03b3N \u2206bz \u03c49 )2\n\n(3.27)\n\nwhere \u2206bz is the change in longitudinal hyperfine field whenever the electron\nspin makes a transition between m = \u00b110 and m = \u00b19. In this approach the\ntemperature dependence is incorporated in the lifetime \u03c410 of the m = \u00b110 states.\n\n\f3.6. Prokof'ev-Stamp theory\n\n57\n\nBased on the analysis of the field-dependence of T2\u22121 , they also conclude that the\nregime (\u03b3N \u2206bz \u03c49 ) \u226b 1 holds, so that (3.27) becomes:\n\u22121\nT2\u22121 \u2248 \u03c410\n=\n\nCs\u2212ph \u2206E 3\n.\n(\u2206E/kB T ) \u2212 1\n\n(3.28)\n\nIn this model the decay of the transverse magnetization is basically due to\na phase shift that occurs locally and randomly as a consequence of the sudden\nchanges in the longitudinal component of the hyperfine hyperfine field (and thus\nin the Larmor frequency), for the nuclei in a thermally-excited cluster. In fact,\nthis mechanism describes the dephasing of nuclear precession without considering\nany interaction between the nuclear spins.\nThe nuclear dipole-dipole interaction would add an extra contribution, whose\nmagnitude can be calculated by taking into account the \"flip-flop\" term Hf \u2212f in\nthe dipolar Hamiltonian for two like spins I (j) and I (k) placed at a distance rjk\nand an angle \u03b8jk from each other [91]:\nHf \u2212f = \u2212\n\n2\n~2 \u03b3N\n(j) (k)\n(j) (k)\n(1 \u2212 3 cos2 \u03b8jk )(I+ I\u2212 + I\u2212 I+ ).\n3\n4r\n\n(3.29)\n\nUsing the Van Vleck formula one then obtains the contribution of the flip-flop\nterm to the second moment M2 of the resonance line, and the TSSR rate T2\u22121 as\nits square root:\nM2 =\n\nX (1 \u2212 3 cos2 \u03b8jk )2\n1 4 2\n\u03b3N ~ I(I + 1)\n,\n6\n12\nrjk\nk\np\nT2\u22121 = M2 .\n\n(3.30)\n\nApplying this formula to, for instance, the nuclei in Mn(1) sites, gives T2\u22121 = 1790\ns\u22121 if the Mn(1) nuclei in the same cluster are included, whereas restricting the\nsummation to nuclei in neighboring clusters leads to T2\u22121 = 111 s\u22121 . The latter\nvalue gives an order of magnitude of the rate of intercluster nuclear spin diffusion\nwhich, as we shall discuss below, is an essential addition to the Prokof'ev-Stamp\ntheory needed to understand our experiments.\n\n3.6\n\nProkof 'ev-Stamp theory\n\nThe Prokof'ev- Stamp (PS) theory of the spin bath [97, 14, 15] presents a major\nstep forward in understanding the quantum dynamics of a giant spin (in our\ncase the cluster spin) coupled to a bath of environmental spins (here the nuclear\nspins). The starting point for its development was to recognize that, in several\nphysical systems, the \"oscillator bath\" theory [98] cannot be applied, because the\nenvironmental degrees of freedom cannot be described as a set of non-interacting\noscillators, and the couplings to the central spin are not weak. Initially [97, 14],\n\n\f58\n\nTheoretical aspects of molecular magnetism\n\n\u221a\nthe PS theory was developed for a single central spin. The short-time t law\nfor the quantum relaxation of an ensemble of spins (namely SMMs) has been\nobtained by including the effect of intercluster dipolar coupling in the form of\nan effective (bias) field [99]. This section contains a review the essential aspects\nof the PS theory, with emphasis on the issues that will be necessary to interpret\nthe experimental results presented chapter IV. Fig. 3.12 can be used as a visual\nguide through the ingredients necessary to arrive at the complete description of\nthe problem.\n\n3.6.1\n\nCentral spin + spin bath\n\nThe first step for describing the coupled system of \"central spin + spin bath\" is\nto consider a single giant spin subject to crystal fields and, eventually, a magnetic\nfield, and to truncate its total Hamiltonian to the ground doublet, neglecting all\nthe physics at energies > \u03a90 (see \u00a73.2.3): in this way the central spin can be\ntreated as an effective spin 1/2 described by Pauli matrices \u03c4\u0302 , where | \u21d1i and | \u21d3i\nare the eigenstates of \u03c4\u0302z . In particular, for an isolated spin having a tunneling\nsplitting \u2206 in the ground doublet, the truncated Hamiltonian is:\nHtrunc =\n\n\u03be\n\u2206\n\u03c4\u0302x cos(\u03c0S) \u2212 \u03c4\u0302z ,\n2\n2\n\n(3.31)\n\nwhere cos(\u03c0S) expresses the fact that in half-integer spins there is a destructive\ninterference of tunneling paths [100,101], and \u03be is a longitudinal bias(7) . If such a\n~ * B.\n~ As is\nbias is produced by an external static field, it is labelled \u03beB = \u22122g\u03bcB S\nwell known from textbook quantum mechanics [51], in the absence of any other\n~ to remain in the state | \u21d1i at time t when\ncouplings the probability P\u21d1\u21d1 (t) for S\nprepared in | \u21d1i at t = 0 is:\nP\u21d1\u21d1 (t) = 1 \u2212\n\n(\u2206/2)2\nsin2 (Et),\nE2\n\n(3.32)\n\np\nwhere E = (\u03be/2)2 + (\u2206/2)2 .\nThe central spin is further assumed to be coupled to N environmental (e.g.\n\u02c6 k , k = 1 . . .

In the notation of Prokof'ev and Stamp, the single\nby vector Pauli matrices ~\u03c3\nhyperfine couplings have strength ~\u03c9k = ~\u03b3k * ~\u03c3k , where ~\u03b3k is the hyperfine field\nexpressed in energy units(8) , and they are centered around an average value ~\u03c90 .\nThe energy levels of the central spin are now represented by two hyperfine-split\nmanifolds, each containing 2N states distributed over a Gaussian with half-width\n(7)\n\nIn the whole Prokof'ev-Stamp literature, \u2206 and \u03be denote the matrix elements in (3.31),\nwhereas throughout this thesis we always use those symbols for \"real\" energy differences.

For instance, in the case of 55 Mn nuclei\nin Mn12 -ac, one would find \u03c9k\u22a5 \u2248 0 since the hyperfine fields acting on ~\u03c3k before\nand after the flip are just antiparallel and equal in magnitude(9) .

Formally it plays the same role as \u03beB discussed above,\nwith the crucial difference that \u03beN may vary in time, as we shall see below.\n(1)\nThe second term causes the so-called \"orthogonality blocking\", since when ~\u03b3k 6=\n(2)\n\u2212~\u03b3k , the basis for the eigenstates of \u03c3~k (defined taking the quantization axis\n~ is not exactly\nparallel to the instantaneous local field direction) after the flip of S\northogonal to the basis before the flip. This means that after the flip \u03c3~k will start\nto precess around a different axis, which quantum mechanically is equivalent to a\ntransition between different nuclear Zeeman levels. The number of nuclear spins\nthat would coflip by this mechanism is given by the parameter \u03ba, defined as (cf.\nFig. 3.13 for \u03b2k ):\nY\n1 P\n2\ne\u2212\u03ba =\ncos \u03b2k \u2248 e\u2212 2 k \u03b2k ,\nk\n\n(1)\n\ncos(2\u03b2k ) =\n\n(2)\n\n\u2212~\u03b3k * ~\u03b3k\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n|\u03b3k ||\u03b3k |\n\n.\n\n(3.35)\n\nClearly, \u03ba depends only on the direction of the hyperfine fields, and not on the\ntimescale of the central spin flip.\nFurthermore, the presence of environmental spins adds extra Berry phase\nterms to the cos(\u03c0S) discussed above, leading to the so-called \"topological decoherence\". The detailed derivation of the total phase is not essential here, but we\nmention that it contains terms like \u03b1k = (\u03c0/2)\u03c9k /\u03a90 , which depend on the ratio\nbetween the nuclear Larmor frequencies and the bounce frequency of the central\n~ (see also [102]), but\nspin (cf. \u00a73.2.3). \u03b12k is the probability for ~\u03c3k to coflip with S\nnow for a different reason than the orthogonality blocking. What matters here is\nonly the timescale of the flip compared to the period of Larmor precession, i.e.\n~ A parameter\nwhether or not the nuclei can adiabatically follow the rotation of S.\nX\n(3.36)\n\u03bb = 1/2\n\u03b12k\nk\n\n~\nis introduced, that represents that number of nuclear spins that coflip with S\nbecause of the topological decoherence mechanism alone.\n\n~ hyp as\nLet us recall that, throughout this thesis, we always express the hyperfine field B\nthe field created by the electron spin and acting on the nuclear spin, which produces a nuclear\nZeeman splitting ~\u03c9 = ~\u03b3Bhyp . Obviously, this energy is exactly the same as the bias \u03beN\nproduced by the nuclear spin on the electron spin levels, which some readers may like to express\n~ (e) * S,\n~ where B (e) is the field produced by the nuclear spin and acting on\nas \u03beN = \u22122g\u03bcB B\nhyp\nhyp\nthe electron spin. Therefore, there is no inconsistency in writing, for instance, the Hamiltonian\n(3.34) for the central spin in terms of the hyperfine field acting on the nuclei! Moreover, it\nshould be clear from Fig. 3.14 that the total bias on the electron spin levels can be obtained\nby summing up the Zeeman splittings of the nuclei, provided we account (by means of \u2206N )\nfor their polarization state. The only subtlety is that, in general, the nuclear spins cannot be\ntreated as a classical source of external static field acting on the electron spin, since there is the\n~ thereby changing \u2206N .\npossibility that some nuclei may coflip with S,\n(10)\n\n\f62\n\nTheoretical aspects of molecular magnetism\nN =\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n...\n\n4\n\n4\n\n3\n\n1\n\n2\n\n0\n\n\u03beN = \u2206N \u03c90\n\n\u03c90\n\n\u2206N = 2\n\n\uf8e6\u00df\u00f1\n\n\uf8e6\u00dd\u00f1\n\nFig. 3.14 : Sketch of the hyperfine-split manifold obtained by coupling the\ncentral spin to N nuclear spins, with N = 1, 2, . . ., assuming that all spins have\nI = 1/2 and Zeeman splitting ~\u03c90 . Notice how the bias \u03beN = ~\u03c90 \u2206N on the\nelectron spin levels depends on the nuclear polarization \u2206N . This picture is valid\nonly when all the nuclei have the same \u03c90 ; in a realistic case, the spread in\nhyperfine coupling makes the energy level scheme much more intricate.\nAn additional aspect that must be included for a realistic description is the\n\"degeneracy blocking\", which consists in allowing the hyperfine couplings to have\na spread ~\u03b4\u03c9k around the central value ~\u03c90 . This spread can have different origins (quadrupolar splitting, nuclear dipole-dipole interaction, transfer hyperfine\ninteractions, Nakamura-Suhl interactions [103], etc.) and could potentially block\nthe tunneling dynamics of the electron spin, since it breaks the degeneracy of\nthe hyperfine-split electron spin states within the same polarization group. Because of the spread of nuclear frequencies, each polarization group is no longer\nrepresented by a sharp line, but rather by a Gaussian peak of width\n\u221a\n(3.37)\n\u0393\u03bc = N\u03b4\u03c9k .\nIn most cases, the gap between unperturbed polarization groups is much smaller\nthan \u0393\u03bc , so that different polarization groups are in fact largely overlapping.\nBecause of the mutual dipolar coupling between nuclear spins:\nX \u03b1\u03b2\nHdip ({\u03c3k }) =\nVkk\u2032 \u03c3\u0302k\u03b1 \u03c3\u0302k\u03b2\u2032 ,\n(3.38)\nk6=k \u2032\n\n(dip)\n\n\u223c T2\u22121 of the nuclear Zeeman levels. The\nthere is an intrinsic broadening \u03b4\u03c9k\ncrucial point is to recognize that this broadening is dynamic, due to nuclear spin\ndiffusion. In practice, the hyperfine bias can fluctuate and cover the whole range of\n\n\f3.6. Prokof'ev-Stamp theory\n\n63\n\neach polarization group, i.e. an amplitude ~\u0393\u03bc , on a timescale \u223c T2 . The effect of\nspin diffusion is therefore to eliminate the degeneracy blocking. Notice that this\nsort of fluctuations arises from what one would call \"intracluster\" spin diffusion,\nsince the model is written for one single central spin coupled to his nuclear spins.\nThe transition between different polarization groups would therefore require the\nexchange of energy with an external reservoir, on a timescale T1 ; in the PS theory,\nthis mechanism is assumed to take very long times. On the other hand, by taking\nmany identical \"central spin + spin bath\" units, one may allow for \"intercluster\"\nspin diffusion as well, i.e. between equivalent nuclei belonging to different clusters.\nThis possibility is not explicitly discussed in the early PS papers, but will play\nan essential role in the interpretation of our experimental results.\n\n3.6.2\n\nTunneling rate\n\nThe strategy adopted by Prokof'ev and Stamp to derive the incoherent tunneling\nrate of the central spin coupled to a spin bath, is to estimate it from the evolution\n~ to remain in the same state | \u21d1i until time t. Its\nof the probability P\u21d1\u21d1 (t) for S\ntrivial expression for an isolated spin is Eq. (3.32); including the spin bath one\nhas to average over the different values PM (t) that P\u21d1\u21d1 (t) may take, depending\non the change 2M of the polarization state \u2206N = N \u2191 \u2212 N \u2193 of the environmental\n~ PM (t) is itself obtained by averaging, over the\nspins caused by the flip of S.\n(0)\n\"topological\" and \"orthogonality blocked\" processes, the quantity PM (t), defined\nas:\n(0)\n\n(\u2206M /2)2\nsin2 (EM t)\n2\nEM\n\n(3.39)\n\n2\nEM\n= (\u03be/2)2 + (\u2206M /2)2\n\n(3.40)\n\nPM (t) = 1 \u2212\n\n\u2206M \u223c \u22060\n\n\u03bb\u2032 )M/2\n\n(\u03bb \u2212\nM!\n\n,\n\n(3.41)\n\nwhere \u03bb\u2032 = \u03bb in the case of pure topological decoherence and \u03bb\u2032 = 0 for pure\northogonality blocking, and for \u03be we take the total bias \u03be = \u03beN + \u03beB which may\ninclude the effect of an externally applied field. Roughly speaking, this means that\nthe effect of the spin bath is incorporated in a renormalization of the tunneling\nsplitting, assigning a vanishingly small value of \u2206M to those tunneling transitions\nthat would require too many nuclear coflips, as compared to the \"natural values\"\nof \u03ba and \u03bb. The really essential point is that \u03be in Eq. (3.40) is no longer a static\nbias, as soon as nuclear spin diffusion is allowed. From (3.38) one finds that\n\u03beN contains a time-dependent part which fluctuates on a timescale T2\u22121 over a\nrange \u223c ~\u0393\u03bc , which is the change in longitudinal hyperfine bias when N pairwise\n| \u2191\u2193i \u2192 | \u2193\u2191i nuclear flip-flops occur. With the assumption that T2 is much\n(0)\nshorter than the typical tunneling interval \u03c4T , the average of PM (t) over the\n\n\f64\n\nTheoretical aspects of molecular magnetism\n\nfluctuating bias can be written as:\n(0)\n\nhPM (t, \u03be)i\u03be \u2212\n\u22121\n\u03c4M\n\n1\n1\n= e\u2212t/\u03c4M\n2\n2\n\u22062\n= \u221a M2 .\n2 \u03c0~ \u0393\u03bc\n\n(3.42)\n(3.43)\n\n\u22121\n~ to tunnel accompanied\nrepresents therefore the rate for S\nThe parameter \u03c4M\nby the coflip of M nuclear spins. In the presence of an external static bias \u03beB ,\n\u22121\nstarts to be suppressed as soon as \u03beB is larger than the typical hyperfine\n\u03c4M\nfield spread. Combining this with the fact that the largest tunneling splitting is\nobtained for M = 0, one finds that the leading term in the tunneling rate takes\nthe form:\n\n\u22062\n\u03c4 \u22121 = \u221a 02 e\u2212|\u03beB |/\u03be0 .\n2 \u03c0~ \u0393\u03bc\n\n(3.44)\n\nwhere \u03be0 is the width of the \"tunneling window\". When some nuclear spins may\n~ by topological decoherence (\u03bb) or orthogonality blocking (\u03ba), then\ncoflip with S\n\u03be0 is given by the energy that the central spin can exchange with the nuclear spin\nbath, \u03be0 \u223c (\u03bb + \u03ba)~\u03c90 . Otherwise, in the absence of nuclear coflips the tunneling\nwindow takes the width \u03be0 \u223c ~\u0393\u03bc due to nuclear spin diffusion only. From this\ndiscussion it is clear that the major role in creating a useful tunneling window\n~ We\nfor the central spin is played by those nuclei that more easily coflip with S.\nanticipate that this is an experimentally testable prediction (\u00a74.2.3).\nThe global relaxation, i.e. the precise form of P\u21d1\u21d1 (t), is obtained by combining\nall the results discussed above. This leads to very interesting phenomena to be\nobserved in the quantum relaxation, but goes beyond the scope of our research.\nWe shall mainly make use of the tunneling rates (3.43),(3.44) and the concepts\nof topological decoherence and orthogonality blocking to evaluate the numbers\nof coflipping nuclei \u03bb and \u03ba.\n\n3.6.3\n\nComparison with the Landau-Zener formalism\n\nIt is rather instructive to compare the Prokof'ev-Stamp theory with the LandauZener formula (3.11) for the calculation of an incoherent tunneling rate. In the\npresence of nuclear spin diffusion, assuming for simplicity the external bias \u03beB =\n0, the bias \u03be fluctuates over a range ~\u0393\u03bc on a timescale T2 , thereby forcing the\n~ to cross back and forth through the tunneling\nenergy levels of the central spin S\nresonance: a sketch of the situation is given in Fig. 3.15. We could therefore\nthink of applying Eq. (3.11), simplified by noting that \u22062 is a very small number\nand expanding the exponential:\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u03c0\u22062 d\u03be \u22121\n.\n(3.45)\nPLZ \u2248\n2~\ndt\n\n\f3.6.

To\nobtain the tunneling rate, we multiply the single tunneling probability by the\nnumber of crossings per unit time, i.e. T2\u22121 , and obtain\n\u22121\n\u223c\n\u03c4LZ\n\n\u22062\n,\n~2 \u0393\u03bc\n\n(3.46)\n\nwhich has indeed the same form as Eq. (3.43). Deriving it via the LZ formalism\nclarifies why the tunneling rate does not contain the timescale T2 of the bias\nfluctuations. On the other hand, by this we have completely lost any information\nabout the effect of the central spin dynamics on its nuclei, which in Eq. (3.43) is\nincorporated in the renormalized tunneling splitting \u2206M , cf. (3.41). An essential\nfeature of the PS theory is indeed that the fluctuating bias is not added artificially\n~ but is built in\nas an \"environmental noise\", uncorrelated with the dynamics of S,\n~\nthe model in a self-consistent way, including the back-action of S on the nuclear\nspins [104].\n\n3.6.4\n\nApplication to SMMs\n\nWhen applying the PS theory to the combined electron-nuclear spin dynamics in\nSMMs, it is useful to distinguish between nuclei coupled directly to one single ion,\nlike 55 Mn in Mn12 -ac, and nuclei located at the ligand molecules, like 1 H (and a\nsmall fraction of 13 C). In the latter case, the strength of the coupling is of course\nmuch lower than for 55 Mn, since it is due mainly to dipolar fields, but the total\nfield is the sum of the dipolar fields from different molecules. If one molecule flips,\n\n\f66\n\nTheoretical aspects of molecular magnetism\n\nit is only one component of the total field at the 1 H site that flips, which may\nyield a situation where \u03b2k , and therefore the chance of nuclear coflip, is rather\nlarge (cf. Fig. 3.8). This means that the protons can be the main contributors\nto the width of the tunneling window \u03be0 , despite the relatively weak coupling.\nOn the contrary, \u03b2k \u2243 0 in 55 Mn, since the whole hyperfine field is inverted\nby 180\u25e6 upon tunneling. This yields \u03ba \u2243 0 and, because of the short tunneling\ntraversal time (cf. \u00a73.2.3), \u03bb \u2243 0 as well. Clearly, we can expect the change of\npolarization group for 55 Mn nuclei to be very difficult, unless nuclei in different\nclusters are linked with each other. This possibility is not explicitly discussed in\nthe PS theory, but we shall see in the next chapter that it is both experimentally\nobserved (\u00a74.2.1), and necessary to explain the observed 55 Mn NSLR rate in\nMn12 -ac.\n\n\f67\n\nIV\nNuclear spin dynamics in Mn12-ac\nThe nuclear spin dynamics in a single-molecule magnet is one of the most crucial\naspects influencing its quantum behavior, nonetheless the experimental knowledge was so far almost totally lacking, in particular in the low-T quantum regime\nfor the cluster spin fluctuations. We dedicate therefore this chapter to a detailed survey of our results on the 55 Mn NMR in Mn12 -ac, starting with the\ntemperature dependence of the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation (NSLR) and transverse spin-spin relaxation rates (TSSR) in zero external field. The data indicate\nthat quantum tunneling of the electron spin is the mechanism responsible for the\nobserved features in the nuclear spin dynamics. The dependencies on small longitudinal fields, magnetization state of the electron spins, isotope substitution, and\ncrystallographic Mn site, yield precious additional information. We then discuss\nthe influence on the NSLR of an external perpendicular field, which can be used\nto tune the tunneling splitting. Finally, an essential and original information\nis provided by the study of the nuclear spin temperature. The results are very\nsurprising and call for an extension of the existing theory of quantum tunneling\nin magnetic molecules. The chapter is concluded by a suggestion for an approach\nthat should unify all the experimental evidences into a new and more complete\ntheoretical description.\n\n4.1\n\nMeasurements and data analysis\n\nAbout 100 mg of Mn12 -ac crystallites were mixed with Stycast 1266 epoxy and\nintroduced into a \u2205 6 mm capsule, then inserted in the room-temperature bore\nof a 9.4 T magnet and allowed to orient for 24 hours. A two-turns NMR coil was\nwound around the capsule, the whole assembly was inserted inside the mixing\nchamber of the dilution refrigerator (\u00a72.1) and connected to the NMR electronics\nas described in \u00a72.2.2.\nThe 55 Mn nuclear precession was detected by the spin-echo technique. A\ntypical pulse sequence includes a first \u03c0/2-pulse with duration t\u03c0/2 = 12 \u03bcs,\na waiting interval of 45 \u03bcs, and a 24 \u03bcs \u03c0-pulse for refocusing. At the lowest\ntemperatures provided by the dilution refrigerator, such a pulse sequence was\nfound to cause an increase in temperature of about 5 mK in the 3 He/4 He mixture.\nWith a waiting time of 600 s between subsequent pulse trains we could easily keep\nthe operating temperature around 15 \u2212 20 mK (cf. Fig. 2.5).

In particular, these are single-shot (no averaging) raw data taken at B = 0\nand T = 20 mK in the Mn(1) site. The (normalized) integral of the echoes is\nreported in Fig. 4.2, open squares.\n\nat such low temperature the signal intensity is so high that we could obtain an\nexcellent S/N ratio without need of averaging, so that a typical measurement\nsequence (e.g. an inversion recovery) would last less than 12 hours. Above 100\nmK it proved convenient to take a few averages, but then the heating due to the\nrf -pulses becomes negligible, and the waiting time can be reduced to \u223c 100 s.\n\nThe NSLR was studied by measuring the recovery of the nuclear magnetization\nafter an inversion pulse (cf. Fig. 2.3). We preferred this technique to the more\nwidely-used saturation recovery [89, 87, 95] because it avoids the heating effects\nof the saturation pulse train, but we checked at intermediate temperatures that\nthe two techniques indeed lead to the same value of NSLR rate. An example of\necho signals obtained as a function of the waiting time after the inversion pulse\nis shown in Fig. 4.1. By integrating the echo intensity we obtained recovery\ncurves such as those shown in Fig. 4.2. For the ease of comparison between\ndifferent curves, we renormalize the vertical scale such that M (0)/M (\u221e) = \u22121\nand M (t \u226b T1 )/M (\u221e) = 1, even though usually |M (0)| < |M (\u221e)|, as could be\n\n\f4.1.

A comparison between an inversion recovery at zero field, fitted by Eq.\n(4.1), and a similar recovery in strong perpendicular field fitted by Eq.

All data refer to Mn(1) sites, except for \u00a74.2.4,\nwhere a comparison with the Mn(2) site is presented.\n\n4.2.1\n\nNSLR and TSSR in zero field\n\nAs mentioned in \u00a73.5.1, the NSLR and TSSR in Mn12 -ac have already been\nstudied in quite some detail in the thermally activated regime by other groups\n[89, 95, 96], whereas the purpose of our work has been to extend the analysis\ndeep into the pure quantum regime [96]. We begin by discussing the temperature\ndependencies of the NSLR and TSSR rates in a demagnetized, zero-field-cooled\n\n\f4.2. Nuclear relaxation in moderate parallel fields\n\n71\n\n(ZFC) sample, shown in Fig. 4.3.\nWhat clearly appears is a sharp crossover at T \u2243 0.8 K between a roughly exponential T -dependence and an almost T -independent plateau. We attribute the\nT -independent nuclear relaxation to the effect of ground-state tunneling fluctuations of the cluster spins, and we shall dedicate most of this chapter to discuss our\nfurther results supporting this statement. It should be noted that the crossover\nfrom thermally activated to ground-state tunneling has been also observed by analyzing the T -dependence of the steps in the magnetization loops [106, 107]. The\nimportant advantage of our NMR measurements is that the nuclear dynamics\nis sensitive to fluctuations of the cluster electron spins without even requiring a\nchange in the macroscopic magnetization of the sample. Clearly, no macroscopic\nprobe (except perhaps an extremely sensitive magnetic noise detector) would be\nable to detect the presence of tunneling fluctuations in a zero-field cooled sample\nin zero external field, since the total magnetization is zero and remains so. In\nfact, below T \u223c 1.5 K the steps in the hysteresis loops of Mn12 -ac can be observed only at relatively high values of external field [106, 107], which is indeed\npredicted to lead to a less sharp transition between thermally activated and quantum regimes [108]. We fitted the high-T part of the NSLR rate by Eq. (3.25),\nas shown by the dotted line in Fig. 4.3: the curve depicted is obtained by fixing\n\u2206E = D(102 \u2212 92 ) + B4 (104 \u2212 94 ) = 14.4 K which yields h\u2206b2\u22a5 i/\u03c49 \u2243 1.1 \u00d7 107\nT2 s\u22121 . The fit, in particular its slope, may be improved by leaving also \u2206E as\na free parameter, which then yields \u2206E \u2243 12.2 K and h\u2206b2\u22a5 i/\u03c49 \u2243 2.2 \u00d7 106 T2\ns\u22121 . Despite the reasonable quality of the fit, Eq. (3.25) is based on a model\nwhich is seriously questionable for two reasons: (i) it considers only hyperfine field\nfluctuation due to \"intrawell\" excitation, i.e. it does not account for thermallyassisted tunneling through excited doublets, and (ii) it does not explain what is\nthe source of transverse fluctuating field b\u22a5 , since the hyperfine coupling tensor\nin Mn4+ does not contain non-diagonal elements (cf. \u00a73.5.1). We may already\nnotice that including \"interwell\" fluctuations due to thermally assisted tunneling\ncould solve the paradox of the transverse hyperfine field component, provided we\ncan demonstrate that quantum tunneling of the electron spin is a possible source\nof nuclear relaxation. We shall come back to this issue in \u00a74.2.4.\nThe roughly T -independent plateau in the NSLR rate below T \u2243 0.8 K is\ncharacterized by a value of W \u2243 0.03 s\u22121 that is surprisingly high, which at first\nsight may appear like an argument against the interpretation in terms of tunneling\nfluctuations of the electron spin. Experimentally it is indeed well known [109]\nthat the relaxation of the magnetization in Mn12 -ac in zero field may take years\nat low T , which means that the tunneling events are in fact extremely rare. Based\non this, we are forced to assume that the tunneling events take place only in a\nsmall minority of the clusters, and that some additional mechanism takes care\nof the relaxation of the nuclei in molecules that do not tunnel. This is a very\nrealistic assumption indeed, since it is well known that all samples of Mn12 -ac\ncontain a fraction of fast-relaxing molecules (FRMs) [83, 82], as anticipated in\n\n\f72\n\nNuclear spin dynamics in Mn12 -ac\n\n\u00a73.2.4. Moreover, that the tunneling dynamics has to be ascribed to FRMs is\nsupported by the experimental fact that, when measuring the NSLR in zero field\nin a saturated field-cooled sample (FC), we observe that the sample magnetization\ndoes not change during the experiment. This can be done by applying a small\nlongitudinal field Bz \u223c 0.5 T and measuring the NMR signal intensity at the\nshifted frequencies \u03bd\u2191 = \u03bd(0) + \u03b3N Bz and \u03bd\u2193 = \u03bd(0) \u2212 \u03b3N Bz , corresponding to\nnuclei in clusters whose spin is respectively parallel or antiparallel to the external\nfield [110, 87]. In a fully saturated sample, the NMR signal at \u03bd\u2193 is indeed zero,\nand we verified that it remains that way even after several weeks of experiments\nas long as the sample is kept constantly at low temperature. In other words,\nthe macroscopic magnetization as seen by the nuclei that contribute to the NMR\nsignal does not change in time, implying that the observable NMR signal comes\nfrom nuclei that belong to \"frozen\" clusters(3) , therefore the relaxation channel\nmust involve the tunneling in FRMs.\nThe question remains what is the mechanism that links the tunneling in FRMs\nto the nuclear spins in frozen molecules. One possibility is to ascribe it to the\nfluctuating dipolar field produced by a tunneling FRM at the nuclear sites of\nneighboring frozen molecules. In that case we may give an estimate of W using\nan expression of the form:\nW \u2248\n\n2\nb2dip \u22121\n\u03b3N\n\u03c4T\n\u2248\nb2dip\n\u03c4 ,\n2 \u03c42\n4\n4Btot T\n1 + \u03c9N\nT\n\n(4.6)\n\nwhere bdip is the perpendicular component of the fluctuating dipolar field produced by a tunneling molecule on its neighbors and \u03c4T\u22121 is the tunneling rate.\nEven for nearest neighbors bdip < 3 mT, which leads to the condition W \u2243 0.03\ns\u22121 \u21d2 \u03c4T \u226b 106 s\u22121 . This is completely unrealistic, even for the FRMs with two\nflipped Jahn-Teller axes. It is therefore unavoidable to consider the effect of a\ntunneling molecule on the nuclei that belong to the molecule itself, and to look\nfor an additional mechanism that links nuclei in FRMs with equivalent nuclei in\nfrozen clusters. It is natural to seek the origin of such a mechanism in the intercluster nuclear spin diffusion, and we shall provide strong experimental evidences\nto support such an interpretation.\nBy magnifying the NSLR rate in the quantum regime (inset of Fig. 4.3 we\nnotice that the plateau is in fact not perfectly horizontal but seems to have\ntwo slopes, with most pronounced one for T & 0.3 K. We may attribute this\nslope to the thermally-assisted intrawell fluctuations in the FRMs, i.e. the same\nphenomenon as observed for T > 0.8 in the whole sample. Since the FRMs have\na lower anisotropy and therefore lower \u2206E, we may expect their crossover from\nquantum to thermally activated regime to take place at a lower temperature.\n(3)\n\nWe cannot tell for sure whether also nuclei in FRMs participate to the signal, but the chance\nis indeed small since their T2 would be very short, due to the quickly changing hyperfine field\nthey experience.\n\n\f4.2.

The dashed lines are fits\nto Eqs. (3.25) and (3.28), with parameters discussed in the text. The inset is an\nenlargement of W (T ) for T < 0.8 K, with lines as guides for the eye.\n\n\f74\n\nNuclear spin dynamics in Mn12 -ac\n\nMagnetization measurements [82] have indicated that the crossover takes place\nat T \u2243 0.6 K in the FRMs with just one flipped Jahn-Teller axis, but this value\ncould be of course lower for the FRMs with two flipped axis and 15 K barrier.\nFig. 4.3 also shows the T -dependence of the TSSR rate T2\u22121 (T ). We observe\nthat above 0.8 K T2\u22121 (T ) has the same T -dependence as the NSLR rate, and can\nbe fitted by Eq. (3.28) with \u2206E = 14.4 K. This indicates that the fluctuations\narising from thermal activation of the electron spin are responsible for the TSSR\nas well, at least in this temperature regime.\nBelow 0.8 K the TSSR also saturates to a nearly T -independent plateau. By\nfitting the decay of transverse magnetization with Eq. (4.3) at all temperatures\nwe obtain T2\u22121 \u2243 100 s\u22121 . This is just a rough estimate since, as mentioned in\n\u00a74.1, the transverse relaxation is not well described by a single exponential decay\nbelow T . 0.2 K. Nevertheless, we find this estimate to be comparable with the\nvalue T2\u22121 = 111 s\u22121 calculated on basis of the dipole-dipole coupling of nuclei\nin neighboring clusters (\u00a73.5.2). It is of great interest to point out that in a ZFC\nsample, to which the data in Fig. 4.3 refer, only half of the nuclei in neighboring\nmolecules should be taken into account as possible partners for flip-flop transitions. Since half of the cluster spins point up and the other half point down,\nthe nuclear spins in equivalent sites should be split in two groups having Larmor\nfrequencies +\u03c9N and \u2212\u03c9N , respectively. For the purpose of calculating the TSSR\nrate that results from intercluster nuclear spin diffusion, this is equivalent to having diluted the system by a factor 2. Carrying out the sum\u221a(3.30) over half of the\nspins only, reduces the calculated TSSR rate by a factor 2, yielding T2\u22121 = 78\ns\u22121 for a ZFC sample, whereas the above-mentioned T2\u22121 = 111 s\u22121 remains the\ncorrect estimate for a FC sample. Moreover, the dipole-dipole coupling should\nlead to a roughly gaussian decay of the transverse nuclear magnetization [91].\nWe have indeed been able to verify both these predictions by measuring the\nTSSR at T = 20 mK in a FC and a ZFC sample, as shown in Fig. 4.4. The\ndecay of the transverse magnetization is indeed best fitted by Eq. (4.4), whereby\n\u22121\n\u22121\n. From\n, is separated from the Lorentzian one, T2L\nthe Gaussian component, T2G\nthe Gaussian component of the decay we can extract directly the effect of the\nnuclear dipole-dipole interaction, whereas the other mechanisms of dephasing\n(e.g. random changes in the local field, cf. \u00a73.5.2) contribute mainly to the\n\u22121\n\u22121\n(ZFC) = 77 \u00b1 3\n(FC) = 104 \u00b1 3 s\u22121 and T2G\nLorentzian part. The fit yields T2G\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u22121\ns , respectively; the ratio T2G (FC)/T2G (ZFC) = 1.35 of the\u221aTSSR rates in\nFC and ZFC samples agrees indeed with the prediction of a 2 reduction of\nthe intercluster flip-flop rate in a ZFC sample(4) and constitutes solid evidence\nfor the presence of intercluster nuclear spin diffusion. This experimental finding\npoints to the need of an extension of the basic assumption of the Prokof'evStamp theory [14] to the case of an assembly of interacting \"central spin - spin\n(4)\nIn reality it is likely that, even in the ZFC sample, some clusters\u221amay have locally the same\nspin orientation, thereby reducing the ratio to something less than 2, as observed.\n\n\f4.2.

It also supports our previous interpretation of the mechanism of\nnuclear spin-lattice relaxation in terms of the combined effect of tunneling in\nFRMs plus nuclear spin diffusion. We stress that, in view of our quantitative\nanalysis of the TSSR, the fact that the NSLR and the TSSR are both roughly\nT -independent below 0.8 K does not mean that they have the same origin in\nthis regime. Rather, we attribute them to two different mechanisms, both T independent: the quantum tunneling of the electron spin (for the NSLR) and\nthe nuclear spin diffusion (for the TSSR). It is only for T > 0.8 that the same\nthermal fluctuations are responsible for NSLR and TSSR at the same time.\nWe point out that, in spite of the even quantitative agreement with the simple\npicture of intercluster nuclear spin diffusion as described by Eq. (3.30), a puzzling\npoint remains. Due to the dipolar field produced by neighboring clusters, 55 Mn\nnuclei in different molecules will have different Zeeman energies, and the typical\nmagnitude of the energy spread involved is actually much greater than the intercluster nuclear dipole-dipole coupling, and should lead to a strong suppression of\nthe flip-flop probability. We shall suggest a solution to this problem in the next\n\n\f76\n\nNuclear spin dynamics in Mn12 -ac\n\nsubsection, when discussing the field dependence of the TSSR rate.\n\n4.2.2\n\nField dependencies\n\nFurther insight in the interplay between quantum tunneling and nuclear spin dynamics is provided by the study of the dependence of the NSLR and TSSR rates\non a magnetic field Bz applied along the anisotropy axis. It is clear from the\nHamiltonian (3.14) that, in the absence of other perturbations, such a longitudinal field destroys the resonance condition for corresponding electron spin states\non both sides of the barrier and therefore inhibits the quantum tunneling. In the\npresence of static dipolar fields, Bdip , by studying the tunneling rate as a function\nof Bz one may in principle obtain information about the distribution of longitudinal Bdip , since at a given value of Bz there will be a fraction of molecules for\nwhich Bdip = \u2212Bz and will therefore be allowed to tunnel just by the application\nof the external bias. We measured the longitudinal field dependence of the NSLR\nrate W (Bz ) while shifting the measuring frequency \u03bd(Bz ) = \u03bd(0) + \u03b3N Bz with\n\u03bd(0) = 230 MHz, in order to stay on the center of the NMR line that corresponds\nto the molecules that are aligned exactly parallel with the applied field.\nThe results for the ZFC sample at T = 20 mK are shown in Fig. 4.5. Since for\na ZFC sample the magnetization is zero, the field dependence should be the same\nwhen Bz is applied in opposite directions, as is observed. The data can be fitted\nby a Lorentzian with a full width at half maximum \u2206Bz = 0.12 T, thus different\nboth in shape and in width from the calculated dipolar bias distribution (Fig.\n3.10). A possible reason for the extra broadening observed in W (Bz ) could be\nthe presence of misaligned molecules in the sample, combined with quadrupolar\nbroadening of the NMR line. The manifold of quadrupolar-split Mn(1) lines can\nbe closely described as a gaussian with total width 2\u03c3\u03bd \u2243 2.4 MHz, i.e. \u2243 0.23 T\nin field units, thus already broader than W (Bz ). Although we follow the center\nof the line for the well-aligned molecules, the misaligned ones (which experience\na smaller longitudinal field) could still be in condition to tunnel and contribute\nto the NMR signal by means of their quadrupolar satellite lines. An obvious\nsource of misalignment is the fact that our sample consists of an ensemble of\ncrystallites, thus there is the chance for part of them to be misoriented. In fact,\nthe misalignment is in any case unavoidable for fast-relaxing molecules, which\nwe consider to be the actual source of quantum tunneling events. It is known\n(cf. \u00a73.2.4) that the FRMs with one flipped Jahn-Teller axis also have a local\nanisotropy axis for the cluster spin which deviates \u223c 10\u25e6 from the crystallographic\n\u0109-axis, and the misalignment could be even greater for the FRMs with two flipped\nJ-T axes. A confirmation for the role of misaligned molecules in the width of\nW (Bz ) comes from the fact that, if we repeat the experiment taking \u03bd(0) = 231\nMHz, thus slightly higher than the center of the line, W (Bz ) appears indeed much\nnarrower [Fig. 4.6(a)] since the tails of the NMR lines in misaligned molecules\nare now farther away from the measuring frequency.

The\nsolid line is a Lorentzian fit with full width at half maximum \u2206Bz = 0.12 T.\nthe data in Fig. 4.5 is \u03bd(0) = 230 MHz, which is just slightly below the center of\nthe line, and this is sufficient to cause the maximum of W (Bz ) to be at Bz 6= 0\nFig. 4.6(a) also shows a comparison between W (Bz ) at T = 20 and 720 mK,\nthus just at the edge of the thermally activated regime. It appears that both\nW (0) and the width of the resonance increase by raising the temperature. In\naddition, at T = 720 mK an extra small peak appears at Bz \u2243 0.5 T, which\nvalue coincides with the first level crossing for slow-relaxing molecules. Since the\npeak is not visible at 20 mK, we may attribute it to tunneling of slow molecules\nthrough higher excited doublets, e.g. Sz = \u22129 \u2192 +8, which becomes favorable\nas soon as the thermally activated regime is approached (\u00a73.2.3). Moreover, the\nfact that W (Bz ) at T = 720 mK and fields 0 < Bz < 0.5 T is largely increased\nas compared to the data at 20 mK, would confirm that the thermal activation in\nFRMs becomes an important source of relaxation already much below 0.8 K, as\nalready argued from the analysis of the slope of W (T ) in the quantum regime.\nIn Fig. 4.6(b) we compare the ZFC data of Fig. 4.5 with a similar field\nscan of W (Bz ) at T = 20 mK for an FC sample. We notice that in the FC\ncase it is possible to define both positive and negative longitudinal fields, i.e.\ncorresponding to whether Bz is applied parallel or opposite to the magnetization\nof the sample. One may observe in Fig. 4.6(b) that the shape of the resulting fielddependence is asymmetric, in a way that resembles the asymmetry of the dipolar\nfield distribution (Fig.3.10). On the other hand, the width in the FC is much\n\n\f78\n\nNuclear spin dynamics in Mn12 -ac\n\n25\n\n(b)\n\n(a)\n\n40\n30\n\n15\n\n-3\n\n-1\n\nW (10 s )\n\n20\n\n20\n\n10\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0\n-0.9 -0.6 -0.3 0.0\n\n0.3\n\n0.6\n\nBz (T)\nFig. 4.6 : (a) Longitudinal field dependence of the NSLR rate in ZFC sample\nat T = 20 mK (down triangles) and T = 720 mK (up triangles).

Moreover,\nas mentioned before, the dipolar field distribution is one order of magnitude\nnarrower than the peaks in W (Bz ). At increasingly large negative fields (where\nnegative means opposite to the magnetization the sample) W (Bz ) stabilizes to a\nrather high plateau with a small anomaly around Bz \u2243 \u22120.5 T. We shall suggest\na possible explanation for the high values of W (Bz ) in FC sample at negative\nfields when discussing Fig. 4.19 in \u00a74.4.2.\nThe peak at Bz \u2243 0.5 T in ZFC sample at 720 mK and the anomaly at\nBz \u2243 \u22120.5 T in FC sample suggest that tunneling in slow-relaxing molecules\nmay also give a contribution under special conditions like high T or inverted\nmagnetization. An important and interesting observation is that, contrary to the\nTSSR (cf. Fig. 4.4), at zero applied field the NSLR is faster in the ZFC than in the\nFC sample [111]. Since we argued above that intercluster nuclear spin diffusion\nshould be faster for the FC than for the ZFC sample, this would indicate that\nthere are more tunneling events in a ZFC sample. As mentioned before, such an\nobservation is only possible thanks to the fact that NMR is sensitive to magnetic\n\n\fEcho intensity (a.u.)\n\n4.2.

In other words,\nafter an initially well-behaving decay, the echo intensity fluctuates at random,\nalthough it always remains below the envelope that can be extrapolated from\nthe first part of the decay. In the same way, by measuring several times the\necho intensity with the same delay between pulses, one would randomly find any\nintensity between zero and the height of the extrapolated envelope. Also, the\nextension of the initial well-behaving decay tends to reduce with increasing field.\nSuch a chaotic behavior is observed both in FC and ZFC samples, and both in\nMn4+ and Mn3+ sites (see \u00a74.2.4). We stress that this has nothing to do with\ninstrumental noise: at any point we see a clean echo signal, just the amplitude\nand the phase are totally random. We don't have an explanation for this phenomenon, but it's intriguing to remark that 0.05 T is just the maximum spread\nof the dipolar bias distribution (Fig. 3.10).\nBy fitting just the initial part of the decay we can still tentatively extract\nthe field dependence of the TSSR rate T2\u22121 (Bz ). Unfortunately, on such a short\ninterval it is not possible to separate the gaussian and exponential contributions\nto the decay, thus we fitted all the data to Eq. (4.3) which for the zero-field\ndataset gives just an average value.

Fig. 4.8\nshows a comparison between W (Bz ) and T2\u22121 (Bz ), both normalized to the zerofield value. As it appears, the field dependencies of the NSLR and TSSR rates\nare quite similar, although curiously the similarity seems closer for the positive\nfield direction, relative to the FC sample. Moreover, the observation that the\nTSSR is faster in a FC than in ZFC sample remains valid when Bz 6= 0.\nWe suggest that there is a possibility to explain at the same time the resemblance of the field dependencies of NSLR and TSSR rates and the efficiency of\nthe intercluster nuclear spin diffusion. The tunneling in fast-relaxing molecules\nproduces a fluctuating dipolar field, such that the Zeeman energy of 55 Mn nuclei\nin equivalent sites of neighboring molecules also fluctuates in time; in this way,\nthere is a chance that at some instant the nuclei in different molecules will have\nprecisely the same Zeeman splitting and will therefore easily undergo a flip-flop\ntransition. If we accept this mechanism as responsible for the efficiency of the\nintercluster spin diffusion, then it's clear that by applying a longitudinal field\nthe drastic reduction of tunneling rate should also decrease the probability that\ntwo nuclei in neighboring clusters would come at exact resonance, resulting in a\nreduction of the TSSR rate with the same field dependence as the NSLR rate, as\nindeed observed.\n\n\f4.2.

The solid lines in (a) are fits to Eq. (4.1).\n\n4.2.3\n\nDeuterated sample\n\nThe role of the fluctuating hyperfine bias on the incoherent tunneling dynamics\nof SMMs, predicted by Prokof'ev and Stamp (\u00a73.6), has been very clearly demonstrated by measuring the quantum relaxation in Fe8 crystals where the hyperfine\ncouplings were artificially modified by substituting 56 Fe by 57 Fe or 1 H by 2 H [16].\nFor instance, the time necessary to relax 1% of the saturation magnetization below 0.2 K was found to increase from 800 s to 4000 s by substituting protons\nby deuterium, whereas it decreased to 300 s in the 57 Fe enriched sample. We\nalready mentioned in \u00a73.6.2 that the \"tunneling window\" for the cluster spin is\nmost effectively enlarged by those nuclei that easily coflip with the cluster spin.\nIn SMMs, this is indeed the case for the nuclei located at ligand molecules (like\n1 H) because their local field is the sum of the dipolar fields from several clusters,\nwhereas the 55 Mn or the 57 Fe nuclei are less likely to coflip since the hyperfine\nfields they experience before and after the flip are almost exactly antiparallel.\nIn this sense, it is understandable that the largest effect on the tunneling rate\nis seen by isotope substitution of 1 H by 2 H. The deuterium nuclei have spin I = 1\nbut their gyromagnetic ratio is 6.5 times lower than for protons. This is the reason\nwhy, in the framework of the PS theory, one expects indeed a reduction of the\nincoherent tunneling rate due to the weaker (fluctuating) hyperfine bias. Since\nin Mn12 -ac the only possible isotope substitution is 1 H \u21922 H, we performed a\nshort set of measurements on a deuterated sample. The sample consists of much\n\n\f82\n\nNuclear spin dynamics in Mn12 -ac\n\nsmaller crystallites than the \"natural\" ones used in all other experiments reported\nin this chapter. Despite having been prepared following the same procedure as\ndescribed in \u00a74.1, the orientation of the deuterated sample turned out to be\nalmost completely random, probably due to the too small shape anisotropy of\nthe crystallites(5) . We report therefore only experiments in zero external field,\nwhere the orientation is in principle irrelevant.\nThe results are shown in Fig. 4.9: the 55 Mn NSLR rate at T = 20 mK in zero\nfield and ZFC sample is indeed reduced to Wdeut \u2243 0.0035 s\u22121 , i.e. precisely 6.5\ntimes lower than in the \"natural\" sample! This clearly points to a reduction of\nthe electron spin tunneling rate of the same type as observed in the deuterated\nFe8 [16], and confirms once more that the NSLR is determined precisely by such\ntunneling fluctuations. As regards the TSSR, the results is very intriguing: slow\nbut rather ample oscillations are superimposed to the decay of transverse magnetization, somehow reminiscent of what is observed in the natural sample upon\napplication of a small field (Fig. 4.7), but without the chaotic features. Fitting\nthe average decay constant [Eq. (4.3)] yields T2\u22121 \u2243 38 s\u22121 , i.e. a TSSR \u223c 2.5\ntimes slower than in the natural sample. Such reduction is consistent with the\nhypothesis that the intercluster nuclear spin diffusion is helped by the fluctuation\nof the bias on the nuclear Zeeman levels when tunneling events occurs (\u00a74.2.2).\nAs a matter of fact, both the NSLR and the TSSR in the deuterated sample are\nrather similar to the data in the \"natural\" sample with an applied field Bz \u2243 0.05\nT. The oscillations in the decay of transverse magnetization remain an obscure\nphenomenon, but observing them even in this zero-field experiment seems to rule\nout instrumental artifacts, and suggests that something bizarre happens in the\nnuclear spin-spin interactions as soon as the tunneling fluctuations slow down\nbelow a certain threshold.\n\n4.2.4\n\nComparison with a Mn3+ site\n\nSome rather intersting results come from the analysis of extra measurements\nperformed on the NMR line of the Mn(2) site, i.e. a Mn3+ ion, which at low\ntemperature is centered at \u03bd (2) \u2243 283.7 MHz. We didn't follow the whole temperature evolution of the spectrum, but comparing our data with the previous\nexperiments [89, 87] at higher T it seems that the resonance line has slightly\nshifted to higher frequencies upon cooling.\nFig.4.10 shows a comparison between the decay of transverse magnetization\nand the recovery of the longitudinal magnetization in Mn(1) and Mn(2) sites, at\nT = 20 mK in FC sample and zero external field. The TSSR is very similar\nin both sites, although a closer inspection evidences that the gaussian nature of\n\u22121\n= 84 s\u22121\nthe decay is less pronounced in the Mn(2) sites, which leads to T2G\n\u22121\n= 104 s\u22121 found in Mn(1) . More importantly, the NSLR is\ninstead of the T2G\n(5)\nAt room temperature, the shape anisotropy is indeed the only mechanism by which the\ncrystallites may orient in a magnetic field.\n\n\f4.2.

This is opposite\nto the high-T regime [89, 95], where the Mn3+ sites were found to have much\nfaster relaxation. Furthermore, the field dependence of the NSLR rate appears\nsharper in the Mn(2) site, as shown in Fig.4.11. The asymmetry in W (Bz ) for\na FC sample is still present, but less evident than in the Mn(1) site due to the\nmore pronounced decrease of W already for small applied fields. These results\nsuggest that the tunneling in fast-relaxing molecules is less effective in relaxing\nthe nuclei in a Mn3+ site than in a Mn4+ site, although the intercluster nuclear\nspin diffusion appears to work comparably well. In fact, the measured TSSR\nrate is mainly determined by intercluster spin diffusion between nuclei in slow\nmolecules, since the nuclear spins in FRMs are just a small minority. On the\ncontrary, the NSLR rate is determined by the combination of tunneling in FRMs\nand nuclear spin diffusion between fast and slow molecules. Since the FRMs differ\nfrom the majority clusters precisely in the electron spin arrangement of the Mn3+\nsites, it is conceivable that this would be an obstacle for the coupling between the\nnuclei in Mn3+ sites of fast and slow molecules, which are no longer equivalent,\nwhereas the Mn4+ sites remain relatively unaffected by the distortion in FRMs.\nThis would explain both the much slower NSLR because of the \"broken link\"\nbetween nuclei in fast and slow molecules, and the slightly slower TSSR where\nwe just notice the \"absence\" of the small fraction of nuclei located at the FRMs\nfrom the participation to intercluster spin diffusion.\nWhen the temperature is increased such that also the slow-relaxing molecules\n\n\f84\n\nNuclear spin dynamics in Mn12 -ac\n\n1.1\n1.0\n0.9\n\nW / W(0)\n\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n\n-0.8\n\n-0.6\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.2\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\nBz (T)\nFig. 4.11 : Longitudinal field dependencies of the NSLR rates in Mn(1) (circles)\nand Mn(2) (diamonds) sites, normalized at the zero-field value.

We may then expect that the NSLR\nin Mn3+ sites is produced by the combined action of the fluctuating transverse hyperfine field due to intrawell excitations [the model on which Eq. (3.25) is based],\nplus the effect of thermally-assisted tunneling. In Mn4+ sites the first contribution\nshould be absent, which could explain why the NSLR in the thermally-activated\nregime is lower than in Mn3+ sites.\nWe may therefore conclude that most if not all the different data presented in\n\u00a74.2 can be consistently explained within our model of tunneling in FRMs plus\nintercluster nuclear spin diffusion.\n\n4.3\n\nEffects of strong perpendicular fields\n\nIn this section we describe the effects on the NSLR rate of a strong magnetic\nfield B\u22a5 , applied perpendicular to the anisotropy axis. The interpretation of the\nNSLR is tightly related to the NMR spectra, which provide useful information\nabout the orientation of the crystallites and the crossover between 55 Mn and 1 H\nLarmor frequencies.\n\n\f4.3. Effects of strong perpendicular fields\n\n4.3.1\n\n85\n\nNMR spectra\n\nIn a single crystal having the \u0109-axis exactly perpendicular to the external field, the\nthree 55 Mn NMR lines should evolve as in Fig. 3.9, neglecting the possibility of\ndelocalization of the spin wave functions (\u00a73.3.2). Our sample consists of a large\nnumber of crystallites, oriented (within a certain spread) along an axis which is\northogonal to both the external field and the axis of the NMR coil. In this way,\nwhatever is the canting angle of the electron spins towards the external field, the\ntotal field at the nuclei is always perpendicular to the axis of the NMR coil.\nFig. 4.12 shows field-sweep spectra taken at T = 20 mK. The sample can be\nconsidered as saturated, since we applied 9 T before starting the sweeps. By this\nprocedure we expect most of the cluster spins to be aligned in the same direction\nwithin each crystallite, except eventually for those crystallites that are oriented\nperpendicular to the field within a fraction of a degree. The signal belonging\nto the protons (a) is recognizable by the chopped top; in fact, the 1 H line is so\nintense that it saturates the receiver on this scale, and to observe it properly\nwe had to attenuate the input by at least 30 dB. Focusing on the Mn(1) line, we\nobserve that at low frequencies and fields the signal is characterized by a peak (b),\nplus a more spread-out background that we attribute to misoriented crystallites.\nThe peak fits indeed with the calculated position for crystallites with easy axis\noriented at an angle \u03b8B = 88\u25e6 \u2212 90\u25e6 with the field (see below), as explained in\n\u00a73.3.2. By increasing the field, line (b) crosses and is retrieved on the right hand\nside of line (a), but now two peaks are clearly visible. The peak on the right,\nlabelled (c), tends to increase in intensity at the expenses of (b) when moving to\nhigher fields and frequencies. For instance, the ratio between the amplitudes of\nthe (b) and (c) peaks is 0.73 at \u03bd = 303.2 MHz and 0.67 at \u03bd = 311 MHz. An\nextra series of small and sharp peaks (d) is also visible on the right hand side of\nthe 1 H line for \u03bd . 290 MHz.\nIn Fig. 4.13 we report the positions of all these peaks and compare them with\nthe calculations. It is then clear that, of the two broad peaks at B\u22a5 > 7 T and\n\u03bd > 295 MHz, the left must indeed be the continuation of line (b) corresponding\nto nuclei in crystallites oriented at 88\u25e6 from the field. Remarkably, if line (b)\nat low fields contained contributions from crystallites at \u03b8B \u2243 90\u25e6 (it's hard to\nbelieve that this would not be the case), they seem to have disappeared at higher\nfields. The right peak (c), of increasing height, could have two origins. On the\none hand, the calculated spectra for \u03b8B = 70\u25e6 \u2212 80\u25e6 tend to accumulate precisely\naround the position of (c), thus the signal intensity that is found in the region 5 T\n- 270 MHz should in principle pile up just around (c) for 7.5 < B\u22a5 < 8.5 T. On the\nother hand, for B\u22a5 > 8 T the tunneling splitting becomes so large (Fig. 3.4) as to\novercome the bias \u03be originating from the longitudinal component of the dipolar\nfields, but also that arising from the misalignment of the crystallites as long as\n(90\u25e6 \u2212 \u03b8B ) is not too large. One may expect (\u00a73.3.2) the NMR signal intensity\nto start being displaced towards the calculated line for delocalized electron spins,\n\n\f86\n\nNuclear spin dynamics in Mn12 -ac\n\n(b) (c)\n\n310\n\n300\n\n(b)\n\nIntensity\n\n280\n\n(a)\n\n4\n\n5\n\n\u03bd (M\nHz)\n\n290\n\n(d)\n270\n6\n\nB (T)\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\nFig. 4.12 : Field-sweep NMR spectra taken at T = 20 mK.

The dotted line is the calculated spectrum\nfor \u03b8B = 90\u25e6 , taking into account the reduction of the total spin by quantum\nsuperposition [Eq. (3.21)]\n\n\f88\n\nNuclear spin dynamics in Mn12 -ac\n\nbeginning with the best aligned crystallites and involving more and more amounts\nof sample as B\u22a5 increases. This may explain why, upon increasing B\u22a5 , line (c)\nseems to grow at the expenses of line (b), and why there is no trace of signal\nat \u03b8B \u2243 90\u25e6 . Most likely, a detailed description of the NMR spectra involves a\ncombination of the phenomena mentioned above.\nOne may ask to what extent can we trust such fine-detailed comparisons between measured and calculated spectra, in view of the fact that the parameters\nof the spin Hamiltonian are affected by some uncertainty. We found out that the\ncalculations are in fact very robust, since the effect of varying the spin Hamiltonian parameters, even over a range much wider that the accepted error margins\nfor the commonly used values, is hardly visible on the scale of Fig. 4.13.\nThe extra small line (d) is rather fascinating: its position is in fact close to\nthe calculated spectrum for a perfectly oriented crystallite, where the total spin\nfalls into a symmetric superposition of | \u21d1i and | \u21d3i as soon as \u2206 > \u03beD (\u00a73.4, Fig\n3.11). This calculation, contrary to those performed assuming S = 10 (solid lines\nin Fig. 4.13), is extremely sensitive to the values of the parameters of the spin\nHamiltonian. One could easily allow the dotted line in Fig. 4.13 to be drawn\njust on top of the data, by varying the parameters in the calculation within a\nreasonable margin. To further investigate this issue we measured field-sweep\nspectra on another sample, consisting of deuterated Mn12 -ac crystallites having\nan almost random orientations (\u00a74.2.3). Line (d) is still visible but its intensity\nis even smaller than shown in Fig. 4.12. Moreover, it continues linearly down to\nat least 230 MHz, i.e. much lower than expected from the calculation (cf. Fig.\n3.11), without showing any turning point. The most plausible origin of line (d)\nis therefore a set of 1 H nuclei very close to the magnetic core and experiencing\nan extra dipolar field \u2243 0.6 T; in the deuterated sample, the intensity is further\nreduced because of the substitution of most of the 1 H by 2 H. The 55 Mn signal in\nthe deuterated sample does not yield well-resolved peaks because of the random\norientation of the crystallites.\nThe NMR lines corresponding to nuclei in Mn3+ sites, whose calculated frequencies for \u03b8B = 90\u25e6 are shown in Fig. 3.9, are broader and less intense than the\nMn(1) line [89, 87]. The distribution of \u03b8B broadens their spectrum even further,\nsuch that their contribution to the measured signal is basically just a uniform\nbackground.\nFinally, we remark that all the discussion made so far is relative to 55 Mn\nnuclei in Mn(1) sites of standard, slow relaxing molecules. Nuclei in fast-relaxing\nmolecules have their resonance frequency shifting much more quickly to higher\nvalues, because the lower anisotropy implies that the electron spin can cant more\neasily towards the field. Moreover, the direction of the local hyperfine field in\nFRMs is likely to deviate from the crystallographic \u0109-axis even n zero applied\nfield (\u00a73.2.4), yielding an extra contribution to the spread of the resonance line.\n\n\f4.3. Effects of strong perpendicular fields\n\n4.3.2\n\n89\n\nNSLR in perpendicular fields\n\nIn view of the results described in \u00a74.2, it appeared very interesting to check\nwhether the possibility to increase the tunneling splitting by means of a perpendicular field can give visible features in the NSLR rate W (B\u22a5 ). One would expect\nan acceleration of the tunneling rate and therefore an increase of W ; in reality,\nthe problem is made more complicated by the misalignment of the crystallites\nwith respect to the field, and by the fact that, at low fields, the tunneling dynamics is provided only by FRMs. Whatever the orientation of a crystallite may\nbe, it is very unlikely that many FRMs will be exactly perpendicular to the field,\nsince their local anisotropy axis does not coincide with \u0109. As a consequence, one\nwould expect any external field to effectively destroy the tunneling dynamics of\nmost of the FRMs.\nFig. 4.14 shows W (B\u22a5 ) at T = 20 mK; the values of W are obtained by\nfitting the inversion recoveries to Eq. (4.2), i.e. by a stretched exponential. As\nexpected, as soon as B\u22a5 > 0.2 T we observe a strong reduction of W , due to the\nsuppression of tunneling in FRMs. For B\u22a5 > 4 T, the NSLR starts to accelerate\nagain: at this point \u2206 \u223c 10\u22125 K, already larger than in most FRMs, but the effect\nof misalignment can still be very important. At higher fields it becomes essential\nto specify at which position we take the data. The main results (square symbols)\nobey the criterion of maximal signal intensity at a given field: in practice, line\n(b) for B\u22a5 < 6.5 T and line (c) for B\u22a5 > 6.5 T.\nAt B\u22a5 \u2243 6.7 T, the Mn(1) line crosses the protons line, which is 30 dB more\nintense that the 55 Mn line because of the much larger number of protons present\nin each molecule. This fact makes it is very easy to recognize when protons are\ninvolved, but it also means that the Mn(1) signal is in fact completely masked by\nthe 1 H signal when the crossing of the Larmor frequencies occurs. The measured\nNSLR (crosses in Fig. 4.14) must therefore be interpreted as the NSLR of the\nprotons.\nBy increasing B\u22a5 above 7 T, W (B\u22a5 ) starts to decrease again. As shown in Fig.\n4.15, the tunneling splitting is at this point much higher than both the thermal\nand the nuclear Zeeman energies. Under these conditions, due to depopulation of\nthe upper level of the tunnel-split ground doublet, the electron spin fluctuations\nshould indeed slow down, consistent with the observation of a Schottky anomaly\nin the field-dependent specific heat Cm (B\u22a5 ) [11,112] which occurs at the crossing\nbetween thermal energy and tunneling splitting. Although the transition rate\nbetween the symmetric ground state and the antisymmetric excited state is here\nmeasured less directly than in a specific heat experiment, the largely similar field\ndependencies of W (B\u22a5 ) and Cm (B\u22a5 ) for 5 T < B\u22a5 < 9 T points to a common\nphysical origin for the two phenomena. The crossing between Mn(1) and 1 H lines\nalso gives rise to an apparent increase in the NSLR, but this is simply due to\nthe fact that the protons line is itself characterized by a higher NSLR rate, and\ncompletely masks the Mn(1) line.

In order to measure the hyperfine contribution to Cm , the nuclei must be\nable to absorb heat quickly enough as compared to the experimental time window\nof the specific heat experiment (\u223c 100 s). Indeed, this condition was observed to\nhold only for B\u22a5 > 5 T [112].\nTwo extra sets of data points have been measured. One set (circles in Fig.\n4.14) is taken along line (b) on the high-field side, i.e. where crystallites with\n\u03b8B \u2243 88\u25e6 are expected to show up, and shows an apparently opposite behavior\ncompared to line (c), since W (B\u22a5 ) strongly decreases just where it would go\ntowards a maximum on line (c). The other dataset (triangles) is taken at constant\nB\u22a5 = 7.25 T while shifting the frequency towards lower values, i.e. moving from\nline (b) to line (c). Indeed W grows along that direction. These observations are\ndifficult to understand if we interpret line (c) as the bunching of the signal coming\nfrom crystallites oriented at 70\u25e6 \u221280\u25e6 from the field, since with such misalignment\nin the field range 7 \u2212 9 T the two lowest energy levels are separated by at least 10\nK, due to the large longitudinal bias. One would then expect the electron spin\nfluctuations to be totally frozen at T = 20 mK. As mentioned when discussing\nFig. 4.12, it is also possible that line (c) contains (at least for a part of its total\n\n\f92\n\nNuclear spin dynamics in Mn12 -ac\n\n0.7\n0.6\n\n\u03b1\n\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\nB (T)\nFig. 4.16 : Perpendicular field dependence of the stretching exponent \u03b1 for the\ninversion recovery (4.2), at T = 20 mK.\nintensity) a signal from a growing fraction of molecules that are very well oriented\nperpendicularly and whose electron spin occupies stably the symmetric ground\nstate. The excitations to the antisymmetric state would then represent tunneling\noscillations of the cluster spin, and, given the magnitude of \u2206 in this regime,\nwe may even expect such oscillations to be coherent for fairly long times [12]. If\nwe adopt this picture, (c) should be a highly inhomogeneous line, consisting of a\nmixture of signals from very well oriented (\u03b8B = 88\u25e6 \u2212 90\u25e6 ) and badly misoriented\n(\u03b8B < 80\u25e6 ) crystallites. In this case one expects the inhomogeneity of the line to\nshow up in the stretching exponent \u03b1 of the inversion recovery (\u00a74.1). Fig. 4.16\nshows that \u03b1(B\u22a5 ) is indeed a good indicator for the inhomogeneity of the signal:\nit first decreases smoothly up to B\u22a5 \u223c 6 T, then shows an abrupt dip where\nalso the protons participate to the signal, finally it keeps decreasing quite steeply\nalong line (c), possibly because of the increasing contribution of nuclei from well\naligned molecules in their symmetric ground state.\n\n4.4\n\nNuclear spin temperature\n\nA crucial issue in the nuclear spin dynamics of single-molecule magnets is to\nwhich extent the nuclear spin temperature [113] is able to follow the lattice temperature (as determined by the phonons in the molecular crystal), and what is\nthe mechanism that links the two systems. To our knowledge there is neither\nexperimental nor theoretical work published on this topic so far.\n\n\f4.4.

The inset illustrates how Tnucl is obtained from\nthe NMR data. The waiting time between NMR pulses was 60 s in (a) and 180\ns in (b). Both datasets are at zero field in ZFC sample.\n\n4.4.1\n\nTime-evolution of the nuclear spin temperature\n\nWe have investigated this problem by cooling down the refrigerator from 800 mK\nto 20 mK while monitoring simultaneously the temperature Tbath of the 3 He bath\nin the mixing chamber (just next to the sample) and the NMR signal intensity\nof the Mn(1) line, checked by an echo pulse sequence every 60 s, in zero external\nfield and on a ZFC sample. The nuclear spin temperature Tnucl is obtained as\ndescribed in \u00a74.1, and plotted in Fig. 4.17 together with Tbath . We find that\nthe nuclear spin temperature indeed strictly follows the bath temperature, with\na small deviation below \u223c 200 mK that we attribute to the heating effects of\nthe NMR pulses. In fact, the pulse rate used in this experiment is ten times\nhigher than in all the measurements shown in \u00a74.2, so it is likely that not all the\nenergy provided to the nuclear spin system can dissipate to the 3 He stream at\n\n\f94\n\nNuclear spin dynamics in Mn12 -ac\n\nsuch a rate. We therefore repeated the experiment at the lowest temperatures\napplying a pulse train every 180 s and step-like heat loads. As shown in the inset\nof Fig. 4.17, Tnucl indeed follows quite accurately Tbath except for a remaining\ndiscrepancy at the lowest T , but now much less evident than in the previous\nexperiment with high pulse rate.\nThe application of step-like heat loads is a useful method to investigate the\neffective time constant \u03c4th for the thermalization of the nuclear spin system with\nthe helium bath, in particular the relationship between \u03c4th and the NSLR rate W\nas obtained from the inversion recovery technique and discussed in \u00a74.2. This can\nbe done by monitoring Tnucl in different longitudinal fields and different Mn sites,\nby which we can easily change the NSLR rate. Since also the NMR signal intensity\nchanges under each different condition, we must redefine every time the conversion\nfactor K between signal intensity and Tnucl . Moreover the monitoring pulse rate\nmust be adjusted as well, and we found that it is indeed the combination of pulse\nrate and NSLR rate that determines the discrepancy between the observed lowest\nspin temperature and the base temperature of the refrigerator. Upon heating up\nto, say, 200 mK, this effect becomes irrelevant as seen in the inset of Fig. 4.17.\nIt is therefore a natural choice to define K in such a way that the asymptotic\nvalue of Tnucl matches the measured Tbath at the end of the heat step. Fig. 4.18\nshows four examples of the time evolution of Tnucl under the application of a heat\nload for \u223c 2 hours, in Mn(1) and Mn(2) sites, with or without an applied field,\nand with an increased 3 He flow rate. We fitted the data to the phenomenological\nfunction:\n\u0014\n\n\u0012\n\nt \u2212 t0\nTnucl (t) = Tnucl (0) + [Tnucl (\u221e) \u2212 Tnucl (0)] 1 \u2212 exp \u2212\n\u03c4th\n\n\u0013\u0015\n\n,\n\n(4.7)\n\nwhere Tnucl (\u221e) is set by definition equal to Tbath at the end of the step,\nTnucl (0) follows automatically from the above constraint, and t0 is the time when\nthe heat pulse is applied. We find that \u03c4th is always much longer than the nuclear\nrelaxation time T1 \u223c 1/2W , and that the dependence on Mn site and applied\nfield is not proportional to the change in T1 under different conditions. What\nreally seems to make the difference is the 3 He flow rate: within the errors, the\nratio of heat transfer from the 3 He stream to the nuclear spins is proportional\nto the 3 He flow rate, given the same conditions of nuclear site and external field.\nThis confirms that the thermal contact between nuclear spins and lattice phonons\nis quite fast, as we demonstrated by the values of the NSLR rate, and that the\nmain bottleneck is at the interface between the crystallites, the embedding epoxy\nand the 3 He stream.\n\n4.4.2\n\nEffect of large magnetic fields and superradiance\n\nTo conclude this section we discuss an issue which may be relevant to most of\nthe experiments on quantum tunneling studied by magnetization loops or fast\n\n\f4.4.

While sweeping the magnetic field in such a way that many cluster\nspins are forced to flip, also the hyperfine fields at the nuclear sites are being inverted at an abnormal rate. One may then ask whether the nuclear spin system\nremains in thermal equilibrium, or the macroscopic inversion of the electron spin\npolarization leads to a remarkable increase of Tnucl . To answer this question we\nperformed a full magnetization loop 0 \u2192 \u22128.5 \u2192 +8.5 \u2192 0 T at a sweep rate\n|dBz /dt| = 0.5 T/min on a sample with initial positive magnetization and measured Tnucl as soon as the loop was finished, with the field back to zero. Because\nof the continuous shift of the resonance frequency it would have obviously been\nimpossible to monitor Tnucl during the field sweep. As shown in Fig. 4.19, we find\nthat Tnucl at the end of the field sweep is much higher than Tbath . Interestingly,\nthe evolution of Tnucl is characterized by an initially very fast decay, whereas\nafter a few minutes Tnucl relaxes to its equilibrium value with precisely the same\ntime constant \u03c4th \u2243 57 min as already found in the heat transient experiment\nin Fig. 4.18(a). By extracting Tnucl (\u221e) from the fit to Eq. (4.7) and imposing\nthat it should be the same also for the initial fast decay, we refitted just the very\n(initial)\n\u2243 300 s. The latter\nfirst datapoints obtaining Tnucl (0) \u223c 350 mK and \u03c4th\n\u22121\nvalue is still a bit longer than T1 = (2W ) \u2243 40 s in FC sample at T = 20 mK\n[see Fig. 4.10(b), open circles] but not incompatible with the idea that the very\nfirst part of the relaxation is the real spin-lattice relaxation, whereas afterwards\nthe equilibrated lattice and spins relax to the bath temperature at the usual rate\nmainly determined by the 3 He circulation.\nIn the inset of Fig. 4.19 we also report Bz and Tbath as a function of time\nduring the field sweep. Tbath remains rather stable around 35 mK except at two\nspecial points, \u22121.9 T sweeping down and +1.9 T sweeping up, where it suddenly\njumps to \u223c 100 mK. We notice that this occurs only when Bz is opposite to the\ninstantaneous magnetization, and that in fact |Bz | = 1.9 T is a level crossing\nfield for the electron spins in slow-relaxing molecules, which suggest that the\nphenomenon may be due to magnetic avalanches. A similar heat emission was\nalready observed by specific heat experiments [114], but at T \u223c 2 \u2212 3 K. On the\nother hand, it is rather surprising to find that the main heat emission takes place\nalready at Bz = \u00b11.9 T, i.e. the fourth level crossing, whereas it is known [106]\nthat small Mn12 -ac crystals at very low T start to appreciably invert their magnetization only at Bz \u223c \u00b14 T. Moreover we know from experience that, because\nof the large volume of our refrigerator, it is virtually impossible to heat the 3 He\nbath so abruptly as it appears in the inset of Fig. 4.19. In fact, such a sudden\ntemperature increase resembles very much the effect we find when applying a\nNMR pulse (cf. Fig. 2.5): we first observe a sharp peak in the measured T ,\nwhich is due to the direct heating of the thermometer by the rf -pulse, and only\nin the subsequent minutes we observe a smooth temperature increase, when the\nthermometer indeed senses the heating of the 3 He bath.

The inset shows Bz and Tbath during the field sweep: notice\nthat the time scale in the main panel is the continuation of the one in the inset.\n\nMn12 -ac crystals when measuring magnetic hysteresis loops. In their experiment\nthe radiation bursts are observed at Bz = \u00b11.4 T, thus the third level crossing,\nbut the measurements are performed at T = 1.8 K, much higher than in our case.\nThe proposed explanation is based on the phenomenon of superradiance [116]:\nwhen the wavelength of the radiation emitted by each electron spin flip is greater\nthan the size of the sample, large numbers of spins may tunnel simultaneously\nbecause they interact with a common radiation field, thereby producing radiation\navalanches. A prerequisite for this phenomenon to occur is indeed a population\ninversion, in this case a total electron spin magnetization opposite to the direction\nof the applied field, which is precisely what we observe.\nIn fact, even though the thermometer detects only the radiation bursts produced by large avalanches, we may expect that weak hints of superradiance could\noccur even at small values of Bz , provided that the magnetization is opposite to\nthe field. An example is given by the data in Fig. 4.6(b), where we investigated\n\n\f98\n\nNuclear spin dynamics in Mn12 -ac\n\nthe NSLR rate in a FC sample with \"positive\" magnetization, and observed indeed that W (Bz ) shows a surprisingly high plateau for Bz < 0. An argument\nagainst the attribution of that plateau to weak hints of superradiance could be\nthat we didn't notice any substantial changes in the sample magnetization while\nperforming those measurements. On the other hand, we are still speaking about\nrelatively low values of W , which would not require an extremely high number of tunneling events. A pragmatic solution to this puzzle would be given\nonly by continuously repeating the same nuclear relaxation experiment (e.g. at\nBz = \u22120.5 T) and checking whether W changes in time, in the same way as the\ntotal magnetization.\n\n4.5\n\nProposal for a unifying theory\n\nWe are now at a stage to gather all the experimental results discussed so far\nand use them as basic elements to build a complete description of the quantum\ndynamics of the coupled system \"cluster spins + nuclei\". The starting framework is the Prokof'ev-Stamp theory (\u00a73.6), but we shall supplement it with some\nextra assumptions in order to account for the observed intercluster nuclear spin\ndiffusion and the thermal equilibrium between nuclear spins and lattice phonons.\n\n4.5.1\n\nBasic assumptions\n\nThe model we are going to set up is based upon the following (experimentally\njustified) starting points:\n(i) the tunneling dynamics takes place only in fast-relaxing molecules, whereas\nthe neighboring slow molecules can be safely considered as frozen during the\ntimescale of interest. For our purpose, the slow molecules serve simply as a\n\"reservoir of nuclear polarization\";\n(ii) for the ease of discussion, we assume that every cluster is coupled to N\n~ hyp always lies along the\nnuclear spins I = 1/2, and that the hyperfine field B\n~ hyp is turned by 180\u25e6 . The latter\n~z axis; upon tunneling, the direction of B\nassumption simulates indeed the real situation for 55 Mn nuclei in Mn12 -ac. We\nalso define a local nuclear polarization for the i-th cluster \u2206N (i) = Ni\u2191 \u2212Ni\u2193 along\n~ hyp * ~z.\nthe +~z axis, and the associated local hyperfine bias \u03beN (i) = ~\u03b3N \u2206N (i)B\n~ hyp ,\nNotice that the sign of \u03beN (i) depends on the instantaneous direction of B\nwhereas the sign of \u2206N (i) does not.\n(iii) nuclei in neighboring clusters are coupled by dipole-dipole interactions\nthat lead to intercluster nuclear spin diffusion. Experimentally, the spin diffusion\nrate is quite fast: we may therefore assume that any sudden change in local\nhyperfine bias is quickly redistributed among all clusters in order to attain the\nequilibrium within the nuclear spin system.\n\n\f4.5. Proposal for a unifying theory\n\n99\n\nFor all other aspects we rely on the Prokof'ev-Stamp model for the description of the coupling between central spin and nuclei. We assume therefore that\nthe hyperfine interactions split the electron spin levels into a manifold of states,\nindexed by \u2206N and broadened by intracluster nuclear spin diffusion, spanning\n(min)\n(max)\n= N ~\u03b3N Bhyp . From assumption (ii) it fol\u2212 \u03beN\na total width \u039eN = \u03beN\n~\nlows that, since Bhyp only takes two antiparallel directions (\u21d2 \u03c9k\u22a5 = 0), the\nhyperfine-split manifolds on either sides of the anisotropy barrier are simply the\nmirror of each other. In the absence of external bias, to any state with \u2206N (1) on\nthe left side of the barrier corresponds a state with \u2212\u2206N (2) on the right side(6) .\nAlso, \u03c9k\u22a5 = 0 implies that the tunneling of the central spin does not produce any\ncoflipping of nuclear spins by the \"orthogonality blocking\" mechanism (\u00a73.6.1),\ni.e. \u03ba \u2243 0. Furthermore, the \"topological decoherence\" is negligible as well;\nthe typical nuclear Larmor frequencies are \u03c9N \u223c 109 s\u22121 , whereas the tunneling\n\u221212 s. In the PS language, this leads to\ntraversal time (\u00a73.2.3) is \u03c4tr \u223c \u03a9\u22121\n0 \u223c 10\n2\n\u03bb \u223c N (\u03c9N /\u03a90 ) \u2243 0. All this means that the only allowed tunneling transitions\nare those that do not require any coflip of nuclear spins, i.e. \u2206N = const.; the\nrelevant tunneling splitting is therefore \u22060 . On basis of the assumption (iii) about\nthe internal equilibrium in the nuclear spin system we may write the nuclear spin\ntemperature Tnucl in terms of the populations of nuclear Zeeman levels. For this\npurpose it is convenient to introduce the populations of the nuclear Zeeman levels\nrelative to the local direction of Bhyp , N+ and N\u2212 , where N+ is the number of\nnuclei per cluster that are in the Zeeman ground state, and N\u2212 counts the nuclei\nin the excited state:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n~\u03c9N\nhN\u2212 i\n= exp \u2212\n,\n(4.8)\nhN+ i\nkB Tnucl\nwhere h i indicates the average over all the clusters in the sample.

The gray areas represent the nuclear polarization\ngroups on opposite side of the barrier having the same \u2206N , such that tunneling\ndoes not require any nuclear coflips. In order to populate one of those groups,\nan initial hyperfine bias \u03beN = \u03beD must be achieved via intercluster nuclear spin\ndiffusion.\n\nare the only ones having equal energy and equal nuclear polarization. In the\nmore general case where we include the quasi-static dipolar bias \u03beD arising from\nneighboring clusters, the tunneling transition with \u2206N = const. can still take\nplace, but requires now an initial hyperfine bias \u03beN = \u03beD . After the tunneling,\n~ hyp is now reversed, the hyperfine bias becomes \u2212\u03beD ; in other words, the\nsince B\neffect of tunneling is in fact to convert the hyperfine energy into dipolar energy\nor vice versa. A sketch of the situation is depicted in Fig. 4.20: starting from\na cluster where the electron spin is favorably aligned with respect to the dipolar\nfield produced by the neighbors, a tunneling transition requires \"charging\" the\nlocal nuclei up to polarization group where \u03beN = \u03beD , such that on the opposite\nside of the barrier there is another polarization group having identical \u2206N . After\ntunneling, the cluster spin is oriented opposite to the local dipolar field, and the\nrequired energy has been taken from the nuclear reservoir, which is now in a\n~ hyp .\nfavorable polarization state with respect to the new direction B\nIt is clear that intercluster nuclear spin diffusion is an essential ingredient\nto attain the condition \u03beN = \u03beD at all. Flip-flop processes between nuclei in\ndifferent clusters conserve the total energy of the nuclear system, but allow the\nlocal hyperfine bias to wander through the whole hyperfine-split manifold until\nthe tunneling resonance is found. A tunneling event like in Fig. 4.20 would\nhave the effect of \"locally extracting\" an energy \u03beD from the nuclear spin system;\nby the same mechanism of intercluster spin diffusion, this energy can then be\nredistributed among the neighbors, thereby attaining an effective reduction of\n\n\f4.5. Proposal for a unifying theory\n\n101\n\nthe nuclear spin temperature. On the other hand, the tunneling process can\nwork in the opposite direction, reducing the dipolar energy at the expenses of an\nincrease of Tnucl .\nLet us recall that this picture, in particular as a consequence of assumption\n(ii), accounts only for nuclei like 55 Mn in Mn12 -ac, i.e. nuclei where the hyperfine\nfields flips by 180\u25e6 when a tunneling event occurs. We have shown in \u00a74.2.3 that\nactually the most important role in triggering the incoherent tunneling dynamics\nis played by nuclei such as protons, precisely because they have a large coflipping\n~ (1) and B\n~ (2) . In that case,\nprobability due to the non-antiparallel directions of B\nhyp\nhyp\nthe condition \u2206N = const. may be relaxed to |\u2206N (1) \u2212 \u2206N (2) | \u2264 2M , where\nM is the number of coflipping nuclei. Although such an extension is essential to\nproperly account for the tunneling rate of the electron spin, we shall not include\nit in our discussion as long as we focus on the tunneling-driven nuclear relaxation\nof 55 Mn (which is the main subject of our experiments) rather than the hyperfinedriven tunneling rate of the electron spin.\n\n4.5.3\n\nCoupling with lattice phonons\n\nSo far we have not introduced any thermostat to set the temperature to which\nthe equilibrium Tnucl should relax. The only natural way to obtain a certain\nequilibrium nuclear spin temperature from the tunneling mechanism described\nabove, is to assume detailed balance between the rate w\u2193 of the transitions that\nreduce Tnucl at the expenses of dipolar energy (like in Fig. 4.20), and the rate w\u2191\nfor transitions in the opposite direction:\nw\u2191\n= e\u2212\u03beN /kB T .\nw\u2193\n\n(4.10)\n\nOn the other hand, as long as the tunneling rates are derived from the standard\nProkof'ev-Stamp expression (3.44), there's no way to distinguish between w\u2193 and\nw\u2191 .\nWe propose therefore that, in order to account for the observed equilibrium\nbetween nuclear spin and lattice temperatures, the PS theory must be extended\nto include the possibility of inelastic tunneling events, accompanied by creation\nor annihilation of lattice phonons. In particular, we argue that an essential role\ncould be played by the time-dependence of the dipolar bias \u03beD that arises when\nthe distance between neighboring clusters is modulated by a phonon. Due to\nthe peculiar structure of single-molecule magnets, containing very rigid clusters\nbound by soft organic ligands, we may expect a clear separation between the\nintracluster, high-energy phonon modes, and the intercluster low-energy modes,\ncorresponding to the relative displacement of the clusters considered as rigid\nobjects. This approach has been already successfully used to account for the\nM\u00f6ssbauer recoil-free fraction in metal cluster molecules [117], which are bound\nby similarly soft ligands, yielding a Debye temperature \u0398D \u223c 10 \u2212 20 K for\n\n\f102\n\nNuclear spin dynamics in Mn12 -ac\n\nintercluster phonon modes. In some sense, this idea is a \"molecular version\" of the\nwell-known Waller mechanism [118] for the spin-lattice relaxation of paramagnetic\nions. The problem is that, if used to estimate the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation\nrate in the standard way, i.e. by calculating the spectral density of the fluctuating\ndipolar field directly at the nuclear sites [119], the Waller mechanism would lead to\nextremely long relaxation times. What we suggest is that the Waller mechanism\ncan be regarded as a source of fluctuating bias producing a similar effect as the\nnuclear spin diffusion in the PS theory (\u00a73.6.1); similar conclusions on the effect\nof the Waller mechanism could be drawn by using the Landau-Zener formalism\n(see \u00a73.2.3 and \u00a73.6.3) to calculate the probability of incoherent tunneling while\nthe dipolar bias sweeps through the tunneling resonance. We already remarked\nin \u00a73.6.3 that the tunneling rate \u03c4T\u22121 obtained in this way is independent of the\nbias sweep rate, in this case the frequency of the phonon modulating \u03beD . \u03c4T\u22121\ndoes depend on the range of fluctuation ~\u0393\u03bc , whose role would here be taken\nby the amplitude \u2206\u03beD of the change in dipolar bias arising from lattice strain\nassociated with the phonon modes. By inspecting Eq. (3.44) one finds that the\nprefactor \u221d \u22062 /\u0393\u03bc \u2192 \u22062 /\u2206\u03beD in \u03c4T\u22121 is inversely proportional to the amplitude\nof fluctuation. On the other hand, the extra factor e\u2212|\u03be|/\u03be0 may lead to at least a\npartial cancellation effect if \u2206\u03beD contributes to \u03be0 as well, which could justify the\napproximately T -independent NSLR rate found below 0.8 K. Since the fluctuation\nof dipolar bias has to be combined with the fluctuating hyperfine bias, deriving\nthe exact expression for the inelastic tunneling rate constitutes a very challenging\nbut formidable theoretical task, that largely exceeds the scope of this thesis.\n\n4.5.4\n\nNuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate\n\nIrrespective of the precise expressions for w\u2191 and w\u2193 , their deviation from the\naverage value \u03c4T\u22121 = (w\u2191 + w\u2193 )/2 will be very small, unless the temperature\nbecomes much lower than the typical range of the dipolar interaction \u03beD \u223c 0.1 K.\nThe reason why the relevant energy scale is \u03beD and not ~\u03c9N is that, in our model,\nthe nuclear spin system can change its global polarization only by converting\nhyperfine energy into dipolar energy (\u03beN = \u03beD ). In the extreme case where\n\u03beD = 0 in all clusters, all tunneling events would take place at \u2206N = 0, with\nno effects on the nuclear spins(8) . In fact, it would be very intriguing to find a\nsystem where ~\u03c9N \u226b \u03beD (e.g. by diluting the magnetic clusters) and check if the\nthermalization of the nuclear spins works as efficiently as we find here.\nFurthermore, by focusing on the NSLR rate W (T ) only in the quantum regime,\nwe have noticed that the \"roughly\" T -independent plateau has not only a slope,\nbut also a slight and broad maximum around T \u2243 0.18 K, below which W (T )\ntends to decrease somewhat more steeply. As shown in Fig. 4.21, by measuring\nW (T ) in the quantum regime in two independent runs, we got the impression\n(8)\nThis argument obviously does not hold for nuclear spins like protons, which have a nonnegligible coflipping probability.\n\n\f4.5.

Circles are the same data as in Fig. 4.3, squares are from\nan experiment carried out in a different run several months before: the arrow\nindicates the position of the weak maximum in W (T ) around 180 mK.\n\nthat the maximum around 0.18 K is a weak albeit reproducible feature. The\nvalue of 0.18 K may not be a coincidence in view of the fact that, as we discuss\nin chapter V, a system like Mn6 orders ferromagnetically at Tc = 0.16 K purely\nby the effect of dipolar interactions. It would be very interesting to see whether\na fully developed theoretical description can account for this peak in W (T ), and\nif this is indeed related to the dipolar interaction energy.\nAn estimate of the NSLR rate in the quantum regime can be obtained by\nwriting a master equation for the populations of the nuclear Zeeman levels relative\nto the local hyperfine field direction, N+ and N\u2212 (cf. \u00a74.5.1). For simplicity,\nsince the internal equilibrium is reestablished within a time T2 \u226a \u03c4T after each\ntunneling event, we assume that just before tunneling all clusters have the same\nvalues of N+ and N\u2212 , neglecting fluctuations around the mean values. If a fastrelaxing molecule tunnels at time t, the polarization of its own nuclei is abruptly\ninverted. Each time a tunneling transition lowers the energy of the local nuclei,\nwhich occurs at a rate w\u2193 , then N\u2212 nuclei have been added to the total number\nof nuclei in the Zeeman ground state. After a time T2 this decrease in local\nhyperfine bias has been redistributed over the sample: calling x the fraction of\nFRMs over the total, then the tunneling event has increased N+ to N+ + xN\u2212 .\nThe same reasoning holds for transitions that increase the hyperfine bias. The\n\n\f104\n\nNuclear spin dynamics in Mn12 -ac\n\nmaster equation is therefore:\ndN+\n= xN\u2212 w\u2193 \u2212 xN+ w\u2191 .\ndt\n\n(4.11)\n\nFrom here the NSLR rate can be obtained by standard textbook calculations\n[120]. Writing N+ = (N + n)/2 and N\u2212 = (N \u2212 n)/2, (4.11) becomes:\ndn\n= xN (w\u2193 \u2212 w\u2191 ) \u2212 xn(w\u2193 + w\u2191 ),\ndt\n\n(4.12)\n\nwhich can be rewritten as:\ndn\n= 2W (n0 \u2212 n),\ndt\nw\u2193 \u2212 w\u2191\n,\nn0 = N\nw\u2193 + w\u2191\nw\u2193 + w\u2191\n= x\u03c4T\u22121 ,\nW =x\n2\n\n(4.13)\n(4.14)\n(4.15)\n\nwhere n0 is the equilibrium nuclear polarization and W is the desired NSLR rate,\nsince the solution of (4.13) is precisely of the form n(t) = n(0) \u2212 [n(0) \u2212 n0 ][1 \u2212\nexp(\u22122W t)].\nComparing Eq. (4.15) with the experimental value of W \u2243 0.03 s\u22121 reported\nin \u00a74.2.1, one would deduce that, for instance, 1% of FRMs tunneling at a rate\n\u03c4T\u22121 \u223c 3 s\u22121 is sufficient to explain the data. Such a tunneling rate is high\nbut not unreasonably high, especially considering the FRMs having two flipped\nJahn-Teller axes and a barrier \u223c 15 K (\u00a73.2.4). We recall that for an easy-axis\nspin S \u226b 1, described by a Hamiltonian H = \u2212DSz2 + ESx2 with D \u226b E, the\ntunneling rate is proportional to D(E/D)S [58]. By simply reducing the height\nof the barrier by a factor 4, we may already expect an increase of five orders of\nmagnitude in the tunneling rate with respect to a normal molecule! FRMs are\nalso likely to have higher values of E, thereby increasing the tunneling rate even\nfurther.\nLet us remark that the interplay between electron spin (tunneling) fluctuations\nand nuclear spin diffusion is completely different from the standard picture of\nrelaxation by paramagnetic impurities [121]. In the presence of an impurity spin,\nthe closest nuclei are relaxing very fast because of the strong fluctuations, but\nthe static component of the field produced by the impurity drives them out of\nresonance with respect to the nuclei that are farther away: one finds that nuclear\nspin diffusion starts to work only outside a sphere whose radius is determined by\nthe strength of the nuclear dipolar coupling compared with the field produced by\nthe impurity. In this sense, intercluster nuclear spin diffusion in SMMs is a very\npeculiar phenomenon, since all the nuclei are equivalent and there is no minimum\nradius for the spin diffusion.\n\n\f4.6. Conclusions\n\n4.6\n\n105\n\nConclusions\n\nWe now briefly summarize the results presented in this chapter, in order to place\nthem in a complete framework of observations and interpretations, and in particular to make clear what the breakthroughs of our research are.\n(i) Incoherent quantum tunneling of the electron spin provides a relaxation\nchannel for the nuclear spin system, and its effects are much more pronounced\nthan expected [14]. This can be deduced from the roughly T -independent plateau\nin the 55 Mn NSLR rate below 0.8 K, and from the coincidence between maxima\nin the NSLR rate and tunneling resonances for the electron spins. The observation of the effect of tunneling on the nuclear spins can be done even in zero field\nand demagnetized sample, thus without any changes in the macroscopic magnetization of the cluster spins. We also suggest that the correct interpretation of\nthe observed NSLR for T > 0.8 K should include the effect of thermally-assisted\ntunneling as well.\n(ii) The intercluster nuclear spin diffusion is fast on the timescale of the NSLR\nand of the electron spin tunneling rate. Its existence can be inferred\n\u221a from the T independent value of the TSSR rate below 0.8 K, and from the \u2243 2 ratio between\nthe TSSR rates in a fully polarized and a demagnetized sample. This is the\nfirst direct experimental observation of such a phenomenon in SMMs. Moreover,\nthe field dependencies of NSLR and TSSR suggest that the fluctuating dipolar\nfield produced by tunneling events may play a role in facilitating the intercluster\nnuclear spin diffusion.\n(iii) The tunneling dynamics in zero external field is ascribed to the fastrelaxing molecules present in any real sample of Mn12 -ac. This follows from both\na quantitative analysis of the NSLR rate, and from the experimental observation\nthat the macroscopic magnetization of the sample does not change during the\nmeasurements. Furthermore, the comparison between NSLR and TSSR in Mn4+\nand Mn3+ sites indicates that the intercluster nuclear spin diffusion between\nFRMs and normal molecules is less efficient between nuclei in Mn3+ sites, which\nare precisely those where the FRMs are different.\n(iv) The isotope substitution of 1 H by 2 H leads, as expected, to a significant\ndecrease of the incoherent tunneling rate, which manifests itself in a congruent\nreduction of the NSLR and TSSR rates.\n(v) The application of strong perpendicular fields produces a broad peak in the\nNSLR rate which is consistent with the observed increase of excitations within the\ntunneling-split ground doublet, as previously observed by field-dependent specific\nheat experiments [11].\n(vi) Even in the regime (T < 0.8 K) where the nuclear spins are relaxed\nonly by ground state quantum tunneling of the electron spins, the nuclear spin\ntemperature remains in equilibrium with the bath temperature. This is a new\nand unexpect result, and its implication have never been included in any theoretical discussion. We attempt to account for this observation by a suggesting a\n\n\f106\n\nNuclear spin dynamics in Mn12 -ac\n\nmodel that combines the Prokof'ev-Stamp theory with the effect of modulation of\nthe intercluster dipolar fields (Waller mechanism), in order to elucidate how the\ncluster spin tunneling can relax the nuclear spins, and why it is necessary to attribute different rates to tunneling transitions that increase rather than decrease\nthe nuclear spin energy.\n(vii) Experiments where a longitudinal magnetic field is applied opposite to\nthe direction of the sample magnetization could be interpreted by assuming the\npresence of magnetization avalanches, which also manifest themselves in the form\nof electromagnetic radiation [115].\n\n\f107\n\nV\nLong-range dipolar ordering in Mn6\n\nFew examples of long-range magnetic order induced by purely dipolar interactions\nare known as yet [122, 123]. Therefore, the possibility to study such phase transitions and the associated long-time relaxation phenomena in detail in high-spin\nmolecular cluster compounds, with varying crystalline packing symmetries and\ndifferent types of anisotropy, presents an attractive subject [124, 125]. However,\nfor the most extensively studied molecular clusters sofar such as Mn12 , Fe8 and\nMn4 [126,127,109,112] the uniaxial anisotropy experienced by the cluster spins is\nvery strong. Consequently, the electronic spin-lattice relaxation time T1el becomes\nvery long at low temperatures and the cluster spins become frozen at temperatures of the order of 1 K, i.e. much higher than the ordering temperatures Tc \u223c 0.1\nK expected on basis of the intercluster dipolar couplings [124,125,128]. Although\nquantum tunneling of these cluster spins has been observed [126, 127, 109, 112],\nand could in principle provide a relaxation path towards the magnetically ordered\nequilibrium state [124, 125], the associated rates in zero field are extremely small\n(< 100 s\u22121 ). For these systems, tunneling only becomes effective when strong\ntransverse fields B\u22a5 are applied to increase the tunneling rate. Although the\ntunability of this rate and thus of T1el by B\u22a5 could recently be demonstrated for\nMn12 , Fe8 and Mn4 [112], no ordering has yet been observed.\nThe obvious way to obtain a dipolar molecular magnet is thus to look for a\nhigh-spin molecule having sufficiently weak magnetic anisotropy and negligible\ninter-cluster super-exchange interactions. Here we report data for\nMn6 O4 Br4 (Et2 dbm)6 , abbreviated as Mn6 [85], whose net magnetocrystalline\nanisotropy (cf. \u00a73.2.5) proves to be sufficiently small to enable measurements\nof its equilibrium magnetic susceptibility and specific heat down to our lowest\ntemperatures (15 mK).\nIn this chapter we report the observation that the magnetic clusters do undergo\na transition to a long-range ferromagnetically ordered state at Tc = 0.161(2) K.\nThe transition can be observed both by ac-susceptibility and by specific heat\nexperiments, thanks to the fact that the magnetic relaxation remains very fast,\neven at very low temperatures, as compared to the intrinsic experimental times\n(0.1 \u2212 5 ms for ac-susceptibility and 1 \u2212 100 s for specific heat). The magnetic\nrelaxation has been investigated by field-dependent specific heat and 55 Mn NMR.\nBy combining the two techniques we are able to study the interplay between\nelectron- and nuclear- spin-lattice relaxation.\n\n\f108\n\n5.1\n5.1.1\n\nLong-range dipolar ordering in Mn6\n\nLong-range ferromagnetic ordering\nac-susceptibility\n\nThe ac-susceptibility data in Fig. 5.1 were taken using the susceptometer described in \u00a72.3, varying the frequency \u03bd between 230 to 7700 Hz and recording\nthe data while slowly cooling down the refrigerator. Additional measurements\nat T > 1.8 K were performed in a commercial SQUID susceptometer. For this\nzero-field experiment, the susceptometer was mounted in the upper Araldite pot\nof the dilution refrigerator (cf. Fig. 2.1), after having replaced the Kapton tail\nby a closed plug. This has the advantage of allowing a higher 3 He circulation\nrate, and assuring a the perfect coincidence of the sample and thermometer temperatures even for T > 0.8 K, when some rather sudden temperature jumps may\noccur.\nThe real part \u03c7\u2032 shows a sharp maximum at Tc = 0.161(2) K. We found\nthat \u03c7\u2032 at Tc is close to the estimated limit for a ferromagnetic powder sample,\n1/(\u03c1Ns + \u03c1sam Nc ) \u2243 0.14 \u00b1 0.02 emu/g, where \u03c1 = 1.45 g/cm3 and \u03c1sam \u2243 0.45\ng/cm3 are respectively the densities of bulk Mn6 and of the powder sample,\nNs = 4\u03c0/3 is the demagnetizing factor of a crystallite, approximated by a sphere,\nand Nc \u2243 2.51 is the demagnetizing factor of the sample holder. This indicates\nthat Mn6 is ferromagnetically ordered below Tc .\nThe temperature Tpeak at which the maximum value of \u03c7\u2032 is found, as shown\nin detail in the inset of Fig. 5.1, is seen to vary only weakly with \u03bd, which\nwe attribute to the anisotropy. The total activation energy of Mn6 amounts\nto DS 2 \u2243 1.5 K, i.e. about 45 times smaller than for Mn12 . Accordingly,\none expects the superparamagnetic blocking of the Mn6 spins to occur when\nT \u2243 TB (Mn12 )/45, that is below \u2243 0.12 K. Since this value is close to the actual Tc , one may expect that for T \u2192 Tc the approach to equilibrium begins\nto be hindered by the anisotropy of the individual molecular spins. We stress\nhowever, that the frequency dependence of \u03c7\u2032 observed here is quite different\nfrom that of the well known anisotropic superparamagnetic clusters. A way to\nquantify the frequency dependence of the peak in \u03c7\u2032 is by means of the parameter\n\u2206Tpeak /[Tpeak \u2206(log \u03bd)], which gives the variation of Tpeak per decade of frequency.\nWe find here \u2206Tpeak /[Tpeak \u2206(log \u03bd)] \u2243 0.04, to be compared with the typical values of \u223c 0.20 for superparamagnetic blocking. In fact it is closer to the value\n\u223c 0.06 found for certain types of spin glasses [129], but the peak found here is\nmuch higher and sharper.\nBelow Tc , \u03c7\u2032 decreases rapidly, as expected for an anisotropic ferromagnet\nin which the domain-wall motions become progressively pinned. The associated\ndomain-wall losses should then lead to a frequency dependent maximum around\nTc in the imaginary part, \u03c7\u2032\u2032 , as seen experimentally indeed [cf. Fig. 5.1(b)].\nIn fact, although the Mn6 spins can be considered as nearly isotropic at high\ntemperatures, the anisotropy energy is still large compared with the dipolar in-\n\n\f5.1.

The constant C equals, within\nthe experimental errors, the theoretical value for randomly oriented crystals with\nIsing-like anisotropy NA g2 \u03bc2B S(S + 1)/3kB Pm = 0.0332 cm3 K/g, where S = 12,\ng = 2, and the molecular weight Pm = 2347.06. The positive \u03b8 confirms the\nferromagnetic nature of the ordered phase.

The specific heat of a few\n\n\f5.1. Long-range ferromagnetic ordering\n\n111\n\nmilligrams of sample, mixed with Apiezon grease, was measured at low-T in a\nhome-made calorimeter [34,112] that makes use of the thermal relaxation method.\nAn important advantage of this method is that the characteristic time \u03c4e of the\nexperiment (typically, \u03c4e \u2243 1 \u2212 100 seconds at low-T) can be varied by changing\nthe dimensions (and therefore the thermal resistance) of the Au wire that acts as\na thermal link between the calorimeter and the mixing chamber of the dilution\nrefrigerator.\nThe electronic specific heat was obtained by subtracting from the total specific heat the contribution of the lattice, which follows the well-known Debye\napproximation for low temperatures clattice \u221d (T /\u0398D )3 , where \u0398D \u2243 48 K, as\nwell as the contribution cnucl arising from the nuclear spins, as discussed in \u00a75.2.1\nbelow. ce (T ) reveals a sharp peak at 0.15(2) K, indeed very close to the peak\nin the real part of the ac-susceptibility. Numerical integration of ce /T between\n0.08 K and 4 K gives a total entropy change of about 3.4kB per molecule, which\nis indeed very close to the value kB ln(2S + 1) = 3.22kB for a fully-split S = 12\nspin multiplet. We may therefore attribute the peak to the long-range order of\nthe molecular spins. We note, however, that at Tc the entropy amounts to about\n1kB per spin, showing that only the lowest energy spin states take part in the\nmagnetic ordering.\n\n5.1.3\n\nMonte-Carlo Simulations\n\nIn order to simulate the zero-field specific heat data, Monte-Carlo (MC) calculations were performed by J. F. Fern\u00e1ndez (univ. of Zaragoza, Spain) for an S = 12\nIsing model of magnetic dipoles on an orthorhombic lattice with axes ax = 15.7\n\u00c5, ay = 23.33 \u00c5, and az = 16.7 \u00c5, which approximates the crystal structure of\nMn6 . The Hamiltonian includes dipolar interaction term as well as the anisotropy\nterm \u2212DSz2 given in Eq. (3.15). When dipolar interactions are neglected, the\nzero field splittings of the S = 12 multiplet produced by this crystal field term\nlead to the Schottky anomaly in ce shown by the dotted curve in Fig. 3. The fit in\nthe range above 0.5 K yields D/kB \u2243 0.013 K, in good agreement with our above\nestimates. For T < 0.5 K the intermolecular dipolar interactions come into play\nand remove the remaining degeneracy of the lowest-lying | \u00b1 mi spin doublets.\nThe MC simulations show that the ground state is ferromagnetically ordered, as\nobserved, and predict a shape for ce that is in very good agreement with the\nexperiment. In Fig. 5.3, we show ce calculated assuming all molecular easy (z)\naxes to point along az , i.e. one of the two nearly equivalent short axes of the\nactual lattice. Similar results were obtained for other orientations chosen for the\nanisotropy (z) axis. We note that the Ising simulations give Tc = 0.22 K, which\nis slightly higher than the experimental Tc = 0.161(2) K. This difference may be\ndue to the Ising approximation taken for the intercluster dipolar interaction.\nIn order to pursue this point further, additional MC simulations were performed for the same crystal lattice, but with classical Heisenberg spins replacing\n\n\f112\n\nLong-range dipolar ordering in Mn6\n\n2.0\n\nce / R\n\n1.5\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0.0\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\nT (K)\nFig. 5.3 : T -dependence of the electronic specific heat at zero applied field\n(circles).

For each point, 2 \u00d7 104 MC\nsteps per spin were performed.\n\nthe (S = 12) Ising spins. To investigate the sensitivity to the type of anisotropy,\nthe sign and magnitude of D were varied. These calculations resulted in the\nphase diagram shown in Fig. 5.4, which we include here since it illustrates the\ncomplicated way in which the nature of the actual ground state and the value\nof Tc may depend on the combination of the long-range dipolar interaction and\nthe anisotropy parameter. Although the ground state for this lattice is always\nferromagnetic, it can be either \"uniaxial\", with strong preference for the ay axis,\nor \"planar\", in the sense that the ax \u2212 az plane becomes an easy plane with\na weak preference for a given direction in the plane, as indicated in the figure.\nInterestingly, the switching point between these orientations is not at D = 0 but\nat D = 3 mK. The reason for this is as follows. Because the crystal lattice under consideration is far from being cubic, the dipolar interaction energy is rather\n~ points in the\nanisotropic. The energy is minimized when the magnetization M\ndirection (in the ax \u2212 az plane) shown in the inset, on the left-hand side of Fig.\n~ points along this direction for D < 0.

Clearly, dipolar interaction must become dominant for sufficiently small values of D. The numerical\nresults show that this occurs if 0 < D . 3 mK. The numerical datapoints in\nFig. 5.4 also show that Tc varies sharply within the \u22120.01 < D < 0.01 K range.\nBecause of the discreteness of the MC simulations we can not tell whether Tc\nvanishes at D \u2243 3 mK. The lowest numerical value obtained is as small Tc \u2243 0.03\nK at D \u2243 3 mK. Outside this narrow range of D, Tc is already almost equal to\nthe limiting values of \u2243 0.7 K and \u2243 0.3 K, reached for infinite negative and\npositive D, respectively. Such a variation of Tc with anisotropy, as well as the\nform of the calculated and observed specific heat ordering anomaly, appear to\nbe specific for dipolar interactions. They differ widely from the corresponding\nbehavior known for 3-dimensional (Heisenberg, Ising, XY) ferromagnetic lattices\nwith nearest-neighbor interaction only. For instance, in those models the variation of Tc with anisotropy is restricted to about 20% and the Tc value is highest\nfor the Ising case.\n\n\f114\n\nLong-range dipolar ordering in Mn6\n\nB = 0.5 T\nB=1T\nB=2T\nB = 2.5 T\nB=3T\nB=6T\n\n-3\n\ncm (J/gK)\n\n10\n\n-3\n\ncm (J/gK)\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n\nlong \u03c4e\nshort \u03c4e\n\n-5\n\n10\n\n0.1\n-5\n\n10\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\nT (K)\n\n1\n\n10\n\nT (K)\nFig. 5.5 : T -dependence of the magnetic specific heat at the specified temperatures.

As we shall see, provided that a Zeeman splitting for the\nelectron spin is created by the application of an external field, the nuclear spin\ndynamics in Mn6 closely resembles the behavior of the nuclei in Mn12 -ac in the\nthermally activated regime, where the electron spin energy levels are split by\ncrystal-field effects instead.\n\n\f5.2. Spin-lattice relaxation\n\n5.2.1\n\n115\n\nField-dependent specific heat\n\nWe begin by discussing the specific heat data obtained in varying magnetic field\nB [34], plotted in Fig. 5.5. Even for the lowest B value, the ordering anomaly\nis fully suppressed, as expected for a ferromagnet [130]. Accordingly, we may account for these data with the Hamiltonian (3.15) neglecting dipolar interactions.\nThe Zeeman term splits the otherwise degenerate | \u00b1 mi doublets, and already\nfor B \u223c 0.5 T the level splittings become predominantly determined by B, so\nthat the anisotropy term can also be neglected. As seen in Fig. 5.5, the calculations performed with D = 0 reproduce the data quite satisfactorily at higher\ntemperatures (dotted curves).\nHowever, when the maxima of the Schottky anomalies are shifted to higher\nT by increasing B, an additional contribution at low T is revealed. It is most\nclearly visible in the curves for 1 T< B < 2.5 T, and varies with temperature as\ncT 2 /R = 4 \u00d7 10\u22123 . We attribute this to the high-temperature tail of the specific\nheat contribution cnucl arising from the Mn nuclear spins (I = 5/2), whose energy\nlevels are split by the hyperfine interaction with the Mn3+ electronic spins s.\nThis interaction can be approximated by Hhf = AI~ * ~s, where A is the hyperfine\ncoupling constant (cf. \u00a73.3). At high temperatures (i.e., when A s \u226a kB T )\ncnucl /R \u2243 31 A2 s2 I(I + 1)T \u22122 [119]. Taking A = 7.6 mK as used previously to\nsimulate ESR spectra measured on a Mn4 cluster [131], we obtain the dashed line\nshown in 5.5. This contribution was subtracted from the zero-field data shown\nin Fig. 5.3.\nA remarkable feature of the experimental data that is not reproduced by these\ncalculations is that, at the lowest T , the nuclear specific heat drops abruptly to\nabout 10\u22125 J/gK. The temperature Tn where the drop occurs depends on B but\nalso on the characteristic time constant \u03c4e of our (time-dependent) specific heat\nexperiment: the deviation from the (calculated) equilibrium specific heat is found\nat a lower T when the system is given more time to relax, as shown in the inset\nof Fig. 5.5. We conclude that the drop indicates that the 55 Mn nuclear spins can\nno longer reach thermal equilibrium within time \u03c4e . We may write:\n(eq)\n\ncnucl (\u03c4e ) = cnucl [1 \u2212 exp(\u2212\u03c4e /T1 )],\n\n(5.1)\n\nshowing that the transition should occur when the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation\ntime T1 becomes of the order of \u03c4e . These transitions to non-equilibrium provide\ntherefore direct information on the temperature and field dependence of T1 .\nAs already discussed in \u00a73.5.1, T1 (T, B) can be related to the fluctuation of\nthe transverse hyperfine field, as produced by the phonon-induced transitions (at\na rate \u03c4s\u2212ph ) between different levels of the electronic spin. In the case of Mn6\nthese are simply the Zeeman levels of the S = 12 cluster spin in the magnetic\nfield B, split by an energy \u2206E = g\u03bcB B.\nAt low T and high B, only the ground and the first excited states, m = +12\n\n\f116\n\nLong-range dipolar ordering in Mn6\n-2\n\n10\n\nBn (T)\n\n6\n\ncm (J/gK)\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n4\n2\n0\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\nTn (K)\n-4\n\n10\n\n-5\n\n10\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nB (T)\nFig. 5.6 : Field-dependence of the magnetic specific heat at T = 0.3 K.

From the linear\nfit (solid line) we extract the average \u03c40 \u2243 3 \u00d7 10\u22124 s.\nand m = +11, need to be considered. We may therefore rewrite Eq.

The approximated expression of (5.2) is valid\nwhen \u03c9N \u03c4s\u2212ph \u226b 1, which is practically always the case, except at very low field.\nIt is easy to see from Eq. (5.2) that the nuclear spins can be taken out of\nof equilibrium either by decreasing T down to Tn at constant field, as in Fig.\n5.5), or by increasing B up to a given value Bn at constant T . This is indeed\nobserved experimentally, as shown in Fig. 5.6. The effect of the field is just to\npolarize the electron spins, which reduces the fluctuations of the hyperfine field,\nthus effectively disconnecting nuclear spins from the lattice. It also follows that,\nfor a given \u03c4e , Bn is linear in Tn as long as the field-dependence of \u03c411 can be\nneglected as compared to the exponential dependence of T1\u22121 on T and B. The\ninset of Fig. 5.6 shows Bn (Tn ) obtained either from T -sweeps at constant B (as\nin Fig. 5.5) or from B-sweeps at constant T (as in Fig. 5.6). The two methods\nprove to be indeed perfectly consistent with each other. The slope of the linear fit\nof Bn (Tn ) gives an average value of \u03c40 \u2243 3 \u00d7 10\u22124 s in the high-field regime. We\nobserve that at lower fields Bn (Tn ) tends to deviate from the linear fit, which we\nattribute to the decrease of \u03c411 . Using the average value of \u03c40 we have calculated\nthe time-dependent cnucl from Eq. (5.1), which has been added to the calculated\nelectronic specific heat to yield the solid lines in Figs. 5.5 and 5.6, and seen to\nbe in good agreement with the experimental data.\n\n5.2.2\n\n55\n\nMn NMR\n\nWe have now the possibility to compare the NSLR rate as inferred from the\nspecific heat experiments, with direct measurements of this quantity by NMR\nexperiments. The 55 Mn NSLR and TSSR rates were obtained following the same\nprocedures and analysis as described in \u00a74.1 (Fig. 5.7), but using a standard 3 He\nsystem instead of the dilution refrigerator. The advantage of the 3 He cryostat is\nthat, because of its construction, we do not need to insert a \u03bb-cable in the NMR\nresonant circuit (cf. \u00a72.2.2). This increases the quality factor of the resonator\nand allows to measure large enough signals without need to reach millikelvin\ntemperatures, where the very slow NSLR would make the measurements almost\nunfeasible. Unfortunately, the useful frequency range becomes accordingly much\nnarrower.\nThe inversion recoveries [Fig. 5.7(a)] are best fitted by a stretched exponential\n[Eq. (4.2)] with \u03b1 \u223c 0.5, although the choice of the stretching exponent does\nnot strongly influence the extracted value of W . The field-sweep NMR spectra\nin Fig. 5.8 clearly show that it is impossible to determine whether there are\ninequivalent sites in the molecule, as regards the hyperfine coupling (compare\nwith the case of Mn12 -ac in Fig. 3.7). This may be due to the large quadrupolar\nsplitting expected in Mn3+ sites, plus the fact that our sample is an unoriented\npowder. As expected from the internal ferromagnetic structure of the cluster\nelectron spins (cf. \u00a73.2.5), the 55 Mn spectrum shifts to higher fields by lowering\nthe frequency. The spectra can be fitted by a Gaussian shape with total width\n\n\fNormalized echo intensity\n\n118\n\nLong-range dipolar ordering in Mn6\n\n1.0\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0.8\n\n0.0\n0.6\n-0.5\n0.4\n-1.0\n-3\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n10\n\nTime (s)\n\n0\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\nTime (\u03bcs)\n\n200\n\nFig. 5.7 : Inversion recovery (a) and decay of transverse magnetization (b) for\nthe 55 Mn nuclei at T = 0.9 K, B = 5 T and \u03bd = 251.5 MHz.

We expect therefore that the random\norientation of the crystallites and, eventually, the presence of inequivalent Mn\nsites as regards the hyperfine coupling, should contribute as well to the observed\nbroadening. Indeed, when decreasing the frequency by 5 MHz the maximum of\nthe spectrum shifts only by 0.24 T, instead of the 0.47 T that would be expected\n~ We conclude that the\nwhen all the local hyperfine fields are antiparallel to B.\nobserved spectrum, as well as the NSLR and TSSR data, should be considered\nas obtained from a mixture of nuclear signals arising from randomly oriented\ncrystallites with largely overlapping and quadrupolar-split NMR lines from all\nthe Mn sites in the cluster.

We can directly compare the NSLR rate W (B) as obtained by\nNMR with the estimated T1 from specific heat data by plotting the line W (B) =\n1/(2T1 (B)) with T1 (B) calculated from Eq. 5.2, fixing \u03c40 = 3 \u00d7 10\u22124 s and\nT = 0.9 K (solid line in Fig. 5.9). The agreement is very good on the high-field\nside of the data, whereas at low fields the NSLR rate is seen to level off instead of\nincreasing exponentially. This is actually the same phenomenon that we already\nobserved in the low-field part of Bn (Tn ) in the inset of Fig. 5.5, due to the fact\nthat \u03c40 is not constant.

It is interesting to observe that in\nMn6 we find T2\u22121 /T1\u22121 \u2243 3800, i.e. larger than the value T2\u22121 /T1\u22121 \u2243 1000 found\nfor the Mn4+ site of Mn12 -ac and much larger that T2\u22121 /T1\u22121 \u223c 200 for its Mn3+\nsites [95]. This in fact confirms the hypothesis that a complete description of\nthe NSLR in the thermally-assisted regime of Mn12 -ac should include the effect\n(3)\nNotice that in Eq. (5.4) the factor 1 \u2212 exp(\u2212g\u03bcB B/kB T ) \u2243 1 at the denominator is a\nconstant except at very small fields.\n\n\f5.3. Conclusions\n\n121\n\nof thermally-assisted tunneling, yielding a contribution to the NSLR which is\nobviously absent in Mn6 .\n\n5.3\n\nConclusions\n\nIn conclusion, our experiments on Mn6 demonstrate that dipole-dipole interactions between molecular magnetic clusters may indeed induce long-range magnetic order at low temperatures, provided that the anisotropy is sufficiently small.\nThe spin-lattice relaxation then becomes fast enough to produce equilibrium conditions down to the low temperatures needed. We should add that similar conditions could in principle also be reached in the highly anisotropic cluster systems,\nfor which it was shown that by applying magnetic fields perpendicular to the\nanisotropy axis, the spin lattice relaxation can be tuned and made similarly fast\nthrough the process of magnetic quantum tunneling. However, magnetic ordering\nphenomena have not been seen in those systems so far. This is most probably\ndue to the fact that, given the magnitude of the fields needed to have a considerable increase of the relaxation rate (B\u22a5 \u226b 1 T), any longitudinal component\nof the field would create a Zeeman splitting that is much larger than the energy\ninvolved in the magnetic dipolar ordering. We found indeed that in Mn6 the\nordering transition is removed already for relatively small fields (\u223c 0.5 T).\nWe have also studied the nuclear spin dynamics of Mn6 , either directly by NMR\nexperiments, or through the hyperfine contribution to the field-dependent specific\nheat. The agreement between the two techniques is very good, and provides an\ninteresting comparison with the nuclear spin dynamics in the anisotropic SMM\nMn12 -ac. We find that the splitting of the electron spin levels in Mn6 , as produced\nby the application of an external field, yields similar features in the nuclear spin\ndynamics as the crystal field splitting in Mn12 -ac. On the other hand, since\nthe quantum tunneling fluctuations are strictly absent in Mn6 , the quantitative\ncomparison of the data confirms that, even in the thermally activated regime, a\ncorrect description of the 55 Mn NSLR of Mn12 -ac should include the effects of\nthermally-assisted tunneling.\n\n\f\f123\n\nBibliography\n[1] D.

Deze twee ontwikkelingsrichtingen gaan elkaar ontmoeten op de nanometer-schaal, met gevolg dat\nde nanowetenschap een zeer belangrijke onderzoeksgebied eordt voor zowel de\nfundamentele als de toegepaste fysica.\nEen van de meest belangwekkende verschijnselen die op de nanometer-schaal\nkunnen worden bestudeerd is de overgang tussen de klassieke- en de kwantumfysica. Natuurkundigen zijn gewend aan de toepassing van de kwantummechanica\nop het atomaire niveau, maar zodra het te beschrijven systeem groter wordt, kunnen sommige aspecten van de kwantummechanica (met name het meet-postulaat)\ntot paradoxale conclusies leiden (de \"Schr\u00f6dinger kat\" paradox). In dit opzicht\nis de theorie nog niet afgerond, het is dus essentieel om systemen te vinden die\ngeschikt zijn om experimenteel te testen welke factoren van belang zijn voor de\novergang tussen kwantum en klassiek gedrag.\nDit proefschrift beschrijft een onderzoek aan het kwantummechanisch gedrag\nvan Enkel-Molecuul Magneten (EMMen). Dit zijn chemische verbindingen die\nbestaan uit een centrale cluster van magentische ionen, omringd door organische\nliganden. De magnetische wisselwerking tussen de elektronspins van de ionen in\neenzelfde cluster resulteert in een \"gigantisch\" magnetisch moment (gigantisch\nt.o.v. de typische waarden voor atomaire momenten) voor de cluster als geheel.\nDe moleculaire magnetische clusters zijn geordend in een kristalstructuur, waarin\nde moleculaire magnetische momenten (spins) slechts een zwakke onderlinge wisselwerking vertonen, zodat het systeem beschouwd mag worden als een ensemble van identieke nagenoeg onafhakelijke moleculaire spins. Hiermee wordt het\nmogelijk om de bekende experimentele technieken voor vaste stof fysica toe te\npassen op de studie van het gedrag van de EMMen. Hoofdstuk II beschrijft de\neigenschappen en het ontwerp van de experimentele opstellingen die voor onze\nonderzoek zijn gebruikt.\nHoofdstuk III is besteed aan de theoretische beschrijving van de fysische eigen-\n\n\f130\n\nSamenvatting\n\nschappen van de EMMen. Een essentieel aspect is de magnetische anisotropie,\nd.v.z. de voorkeur van de cluster spin om zich te orienteren in een van de twee\ntegenovergestelde richtingen langs een bepaalde voorkeursas. Om de spin om\nte klappen moet er een bepaalde energie worden toegevoerd, bijvoorbeeld via\nthermische excitatie. Als het systeem tot een temperatuur veel lager dan de\nanisotropie energie wordt afgekoeld, dan zijn de cluster spins \"bevroren\", wat\nsuggereert dat het mogelijk zou zijn om EMMen te gebruiken als magnetische\ngeheugens, op voorwaarde dat er geen andere mechanisme is dat de richting van\nde spins kan inverteren.\nDat extra mechanisme bestaat feitelijk wel, als een compleet kwantummechanisch model van de cluster spin wordt toegepast. Omdat twee tegenovergestelde\nrichtingen van de spin dezelfde energie hebben, is er een mogelijkheid voor de\nspin om te tunnelen door de barri\u00e8re, d.v.z. zonder dat extra energie wordt\ntoegevoegd. Dit fenomeen bestaat niet in de klassieke fysica, en het is vrij wonderlijk om het te kunnen waarnemen in een zo groot systeem als een EMM. De\nProkof'ev-Stamp theorie van het \"spin-bad\" is een antwoord op de vraag hoe\nkwantumtunneling in een EMM kan plaatsvinden ondanks zijn koppeling met\nde omgeving, die normaal gesproken de mogelijkheid voor tunnelen geheel uitsluit. De totale elektronspin van een EMM is magnetisch gekoppeld aan de kernspins in zijn omgeving, maar deze koppeling is sterk be\u00efnvloed door de dynamica\nvan de kernspins. Bovendien, zijn de dipolaire koppeling tussen clusterspins en\nde invloed van roostertrillingen (fononen) ook van belang voor een nauwkeurige\nbeschrijving van het kwamtumgedrag van EMMen.\nEen van de meest aantrekkelijke eigenschappen van de EMMen voor de studie\nvan kwantummechanische verschijnselelen op moleculaire schaal, is dat het mogelijk is om de tunnelwaarschijnlijkheid te veranderen door een extern magnetisch\nveld aan te leggen, loodrecht op de anisotropie as. Deze \"instelbaarheid\" is niet\nalleen handig voor het fundamentele onderzoek, maar geeft ook de hoop om\ncoherente kwantummechanische oscillaties van de cluster spin te kunnen produceren, waardoor de EMMen als basis element voor een kwantumcomputer zouden\nkunnen worden gebruikt.\nWe hebben de bovengenoemden aspecten van de interactie tussen EMMen\nen hun omgeving bestudeerd door middel van experimenten aan de kernspin dynamica van 55 Mn kernen in de Mn12 -ac molecuul, beschreven in hoofdstuk IV. De\nMn12 -ac moleculen bevatten clusters van 12 mangaan atomen, magnetisch gekoppeld tot een cluster met totale spin S = 10. Dankzij de hoge anisotropiebarriere,\nis het bij temperaturen lager dan T \u223c 2 K mogelijk om kernspinresonantie (NMR)\nexperiementen uit te voeren zonder dat een extern magnetisch veld aangelegd\nhoeft te worden, d.w.z met behulp van het bijna-statische hyperfijne veld dat door\nde electronspins geproduceerd is. De metingen van de kern spin-rooster relaxatie\nduiden dat de magnetische fluctuaties veroorzaakt worden door kwantumtunnelen\nvan de cluster spin, dat zich manifesteert in een temperatuur-onafhakelijk gedrag\nvan de relaxatietijden voor T < 0.8 K. Als extra bewijs voor de anwezigheid van\n\n\fSamenvatting\n\n131\n\nkwantumtunnel verschijnselen, vinden we dat er een maximum van de kernspinrelaxatie bij veld nul is, wat klopt met de resonantievoorwaarde voor de cluster\nspin. Verder, bewijzen we dat het mogelijk is om \"flip-flop\" overgangen tussen\nkernspins in verschillende clusters te hebben. Dit betekent dat de kernspinpolarisatie via spin-diffusie over het hele sample verdeeld kan worden, wat van belang is\nvoor het interne evenwicht van het kernspinsysteem. In feite, is de gemeten spinrooster relaxatietijd verrassend snel, in aanmerking nemend hoe klein de kans\nop tunnelen wel is. We hebben daarom voorgesteld dat het kwantumtunnelen in\neen kleine fractie zogenaamde \"snelle moleculen\" plaatsvindt: dat zijn moleculen\nwaar, vanwege een lokale verstoring, de anisotropie barriere veel lager is dan normaal, zodat de cluster spin een veel hogere tunnelwaarschijnlijkheid heeft. De\neigen kernspins van de snelle moleculen worden door het kwantumtunnelen gerelaxeerd, waarna de kernspin diffusie zorgt voor de overdracht van energie naar\nde kernen in de langzame moleculen. Deze interpretatie van het mechanisme\nvan kernspinrelaxatie wordt bevestigd door de vergelijking tussen het gedrag van\nde kernspins in verschillende niet-equivalente Mn ionen in het molecuul. Anderzijds, zoals voorspeld door Prokof'ev en Stamp, stiumuleert de dynamica van de\nkernspins het kwantumtunnelen van de cluster spin. We hebben NMR metingen uitgevoerd op een sample waarin de waterstof atomen gedeeltelijk vervangen\nwaren door deuterium atomen, waardooe de kernen een kleiner magnetisch moment hebben. Inderdaad vonden wij daarop een veel langzamere kernspin-rooster\nen spin-spin relaxatie, waarmee is aangetoond dat de tunnelwaarschijnlijkheid\nkleiner wordt als de elektron-kern koppelingen worden verzwakt.\nAdditionele metingen aan de afhankelijkheid van de kern spin-rooster relaxatie\nvan een veld aangelegd loodrecht op de voorkeursrichting bevestigen vroegere\nresultaten van soortelijke warmte experimenten in onze groep.\nTen slotte hebben we een aspect van de kernspindynamica onderzocht, dat\nnooit eerder in beschouwing was genomen, namelijk het verband tussen de kernspintemperatuur en de kwantumtunnel fluctuaties van de cluster spins. Het is inderdaad helemaal niet triviaal om te voorspellen wat de evenwichtspolarisatie van\nhet kernspinsysteem zal zijn, als de dynamica gedreven wordt door temperatuuronafhankelijke kwantum verschijnselen. Wij vonden tot onze verrassing uit onze\nexperimenten dat de kernspintemperatuur in evenwicht blijft met de roostertemperatuur. Dit resultaat vraagt om een uitbreiding van de bestaande theorie\u00ebn\nvan het gekoppeld systeem \"kwantum spin + spin-bad\" met een koppeling naar\nhet rooster, en is van groot belang voor een nauwkeurige berekening van de decoherentie snelheid. We sluiten hoodfstuk IV dan ook af met een voorstel voor\neen model dat al deze observaties in beschouwing neemt.\nIn hoofdstuk V beschrijven we een aantal experimenten aan een vrij bijzondere EMM, de moleculaire cluster verbinding Mn6 , die clusters bestaande uit\n6 mangaan ionen in een zeer symmetrische structuur bevat, zozeer dat de totale anisotropie van de cluster bijna verwaarloosbaar is. Hier verwachten we dus\ngeen kwantummechanisch tunnel verschijnsel, maar wel dat de cluster spins in\n\n\f132\n\nSamenvatting\n\nevenwicht met het rooster blijven tot zeer lage temperaturen. Dit wordt inderdaad bevestigd door onze metingen van de ac-susceptibiliteit en de soortelijke\nwarmte. Dankzij de snelle relaxatie krijgen de cluster spins de mogelijkheid\nom de thermodynamische evenwichtstoestand te vinden, die bij voldeoende lage\ntemperatuur (beneden 0.16 K) correspondeert met een ferromagnetische langeafstands-ordening. Het bijzondere van deze lange afstands ordening is dat zij\nuitsluitend wordt veroorzaakt door dipolaire interacties tussen de cluster spins,\nzoals bevestigd wordt door numerieke berekeningen m.b.v. Monte-Carlo simulaties. De metingen van de veld-afhankelijkheid van de soortelijke warmte laat\nzien hoe de kernspins buiten thermsiche evenwicht kunnen worden gebracht als\nde cluster elektronspins geprolariseerd zijn door een sterke aangelegde veld. We\nhebben dit verder kunnen bevestigen en onderzoeken door NMR metingen aan\nde kernspin-rooster relaxatie van ditzelfde systeem.\nSamenvattend kunnen we stellen dat het proefschrift een grondig onderzoek\nbeschrijft naar de kwantumdynamica van moleculaire spins, in het bijzonder naar\nde interactie tussen de kwantumspin en zijn omgeving. Dit is van groot fundamenteel belang voor de kwantummechanische beschrijving van mesoscopische\nsystemen, en zou zelfs essentieel kunnen zijn voor toekomstige toepassingen van\nde EMMen op het gebied van magnetische geheugens of kwantumcomputers.\n\n\f133\n\nList of Publications\n1.
