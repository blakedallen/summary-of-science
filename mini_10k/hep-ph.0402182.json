This method, which here is referred to as Bose-Einstein\ncorrelations (BEC), has been further extended by Goldhaber et al., [2] to the system of identical\nhadron pairs produced in two-particle collisions. Taking the hadron emitter to be a sphere of\nradius r with a Gaussian distribution, the correlation function C(p1 , p2 ) of pairs of identical\nbosons with momenta p1 and p2 can be parametrised by\nC(Q) = 1 + \u03bbe\u2212r\n\n2 Q2\n\n,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Q2 = \u2212(p1 \u2212 p2 )2 . The \u03bb parameter, usually referred to as the chaoticity parameter,\nis a measure of the incoherence level of the hadrons source. However, the estimated \u03bb values\nobtained from BEC analyses are also affected by the purity level of the identical hadron pairs\nsample taken from the experimental data. In recent years the BEC interferometry of pairs of\ncharged pions is extensively used in order to investigate the underlying dynamical processes\noccurring in heavy ion collisions at ultra high energies [3]. In parallel, the BEC analysis was and\n\u221a\nis also applied to e+ e\u2212 annihilations at different centre-of-mass energies s, and as a function\nof the outgoing hadron mass, in order to estimate the emitter dimension [4]. Lately a special\nattention has been given to the role, if any, of these BEC in the reaction e+ e\u2212 \u2192 W + W \u2212 \u2192\nhadrons in order to estimate their possible effect on the W mass determination [5].\nAn early compilation of the r\u03c0\u00b1 \u03c0\u00b1 values measured in heavy ions collisions [6] is seen in\nFig. 1 to be rather well described by the straight line representing the relation r = 1.2A1/3 fm,\nthe known nucleus radius dependence on the atomic number A. This increase is attributed to\nthe rise of the number of hadron sources, such as the nucleon-nucleon interaction, which occur\nas the atomic number of the colliding ions increases [3]. At the same time the BEC deduced r\nvalues, extracted from e+ e\u2212 annihilations leading mainly to pions, seem to be rather independent of the centre of mass energy of the colliding electrons. This is illustrated in Fig. 2 where\nthe small deviations from a constant r value are attributed to the variation in the experimental\nprocedures adopted in each of the BEC analyses [4, 7]. Additional information concerning the\nproperties of the BEC extracted r dimension is coming from the hadronic Z 0 decays where it\nis found that the r value increases with number of hadron jets and charged pion multiplicity [8].\nHere it is shown that the observed energy independent behaviour of r in e+ e\u2212 \u2192 hadrons\nannihilations is consistent with the assumption that only hadrons emerging from the same final\nstate hadron jet can be correlated. In addition, this approach leads also to an r increase of\nsome 10% of the three-jet hadronic Z 0 decays over that expected for two-jets decay events.\nFinally the hadron jet source approach is applied to the hadronic \u03a5(9.46) decays via the three\ngluons and one photon processes.\n1\n\n\fRadius (fm)\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n1/3\n\nA\n\nFigure 1: A compilation of r\u03c0\u00b1 \u03c0\u00b1 extracted from BEC analyses of identical charged pion-pairs produced in heavy ion collisions shown as a function of A1/3 where A is the atomic number of the\nprojectile. The values are taken from Ref. [6] and whenever more than one value was given for the\nsame projectile the plotted value is their average. The line represents the relation r = 1.2A1/3 fm.\n\n2\n\nThe hadron source approach in cumulants and BEC\n\nA direct way to extract the genuine dynamical correlations of two and more hadrons, produced\nin high energy reactions, is offered by the so called bin-averaged normalised factorial cumulant\nmoments Kq , here denoted simply as cumulants, where q is the size of the hadron group and\nis equal e.g. to 2 for a pion-pair system. This method, which was first proposed in [9] and\ndescribed in details in [10], has been applied in the study of multi-particle dynamical fluctuations. In these investigations, also referred to as intermittency analyses, the dependence of\nthe cumulants values on the average multiplicity has been proposed to be the consequence of a\nmixing of several well defined hadron emission sources [11\u201315].\nIn this emission source approach, correlations exist only between particles emitted from\nthe same source so that the correlation strength is reduced whenever particles are grouped\nfrom more than one source. For a quantitative evaluation of this reduction we follow here\nclosely Ref. [15] in its treatment of the one dimensional (rapidity) cumulants Kqav , which are\naveraged over M bins with the condition that M \u2265 10. If one denotes the average value of a\ncumulant determined from one hadron source as Kqav(1) then the cumulant Kqav(k) , calculated\nfor all possible q-groups from a state k of more than one source, will be diluted by a factor Dq(k)\nso that\nKqav(k) = Dq(k) Kqav(1) ,\n(2)\n2\n\n\f1.6\n1.4\n1.2\n\n\u274d MARKII\n\n\u2206 ALEPH\n\n\u274f TASSO\n\n\u2747 DELPHI\n\n\u25b2 CLEO\n\n\u25cf L3\n\n\u25a0 AMY\n\n\u272d OPAL\n\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4 J/\u03c8 \u03a5\n\u2193 \u2193\n0\n\n0\n\nZ\n\u2193\n\n25\n\n50\n\n75\n\n100\n\nFigure 2: Values of r\u03c0\u00b1 \u03c0\u00b1 obtained from Bose-Einstein correlation analyses of hadrons produced in\n\n\u221a\ne+ e\u2212 annihilations [4, 7]) plotted against s. The shown band is the r\u03c0\u00b1 \u03c0\u00b1 behaviour expected for\na constant \u03bb value from the hadron source approach, normalised at 91 GeV to the r value obtained\nby the ALEPH collaboration. The continuous and dashed lines correspond respectively to the xmax\nvalues of 0.99 and 0.95 used in calculating hDqqg i via Eq. (12).\n\nwhere Dq(k) is equal to\nDq(k) =\n\n(PqG\n\nPqG\n.\n+ PqN G )\n\n(3)\n\nHere PqG denotes the number of q-particle groups, e.g. pairs of pions, emerging from the same\nsource while PqN G stands for the number of all possible combinations of q-particle groups which\nemerge from at least two sources. In Ref. [15] it has further been shown that in the case of S\nidentical sources, each having the same charged multiplicity n, one has for q = 2 that\n(k)\nDq=2\n\n= \u0010n\u0011\n2\n\n\u0010 \u0011\nn\n2\n\nS\n\nS + n2\n\nn\u226b1\n\n\u0010 \u0011\nS\n2\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\n1\n.\nS\n\n(4)\nn\u226bq\n\nThis expression for q = 2 can be generalised for q \u2265 1 to yield Dq \u2212\u2192 1/S q\u22121 . For the present\nwork it is important to realise that even in the case where the number of sources remains the\nsame, but the condition of equal multiplicity is lifted, the dilution factor Dq may change when\nthe over-all multiplicity and/or its division between the sources is modified.\nIn the case of two particle correlations, which obviously are genuine, one is able to relate [16]\nthe normalised cumulant K2 and the BEC correlation function C(p1 , p2 ), namely:\nC(p1 , p2 ) \u2212 1 = K2 (p1 , p2 ) .\n3\n\n(5)\n\n\fA comparison between this expression and Eq. (1) affords the possibility to utilise the dependence of the averaged normalised cumulant on the hadron sources and their charged multiplicity\n2 2\nconfiguration to the BEC correlation term \u03bbe\u2212r Q average over the Q variable. Specifically, let\nav(m)\nav(k)\nus consider the ratio of the normalised average cumulants K2\n/K2 , where the superscripts\nm and k denote two different hadron sources configurations. Thus one has\nav(m)\nav(k)\nK2\n/K2\n\n= hC\n\n(m)\n\n(Q) \u2212 1i/hC\nav(m)\n\n(k)\n\n(Q) \u2212 1i =\nav(k)\n\n\u221e\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n(m)\n\n2 Q2\n\u2212rm\n\n\u03bbm e\n\n/\n\ndQ\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\n2\n\n2\n\n\u03bbk e\u2212rk Q dQ =\n\n\u03bb m rk\n.\n\u03bb k rm\n\n(k)\n\nFrom Eq. (2) follows that K2\n/K2\n= D2 /D2 so that one finally obtains a simple\nrelation between the hadron emitter radii and the dilution factors, namely\n(k)\n\nrm =\n\n\u03bb m D2\nrk .\n\u03bbk D2(m)\n\n(6)\n\nIf we set the final state k to be that emerging from a single source and assign to it the\n(1)\nvalue k = 1, then D2 serves as a yardstick against which dilution factors of other final states\nare measured. Thus for identical sources having the same \u03bb and average charged multiplicity,\nEq. (6) reduces with the help of relation (4) to rm = Sr1 where r1 is the emitter radius\nof a single hadron source. Hence r increases linearly with S, the number of hadron sources.\nAlthough it seems a priori naturally to choose for the heavy ions reactions the nucleon-nucleon\ncollision as the basic single hadron source, the actual description of nuclei reaction is much\nmore complicated mainly due to the secondary interactions within the nucleus.\n\n3\n\nr\u03c0\u00b1\u03c0\u00b1 versus\n\n\u221a\n\ns in e+e\u2212 annihilation\n\n\u221a\nIn the following we propose to study the dependence of r\u03c0\u00b1 \u03c0\u00b1 on s, as measured in the\ne+ e\u2212 \u2192 hadrons annihilation, in terms of the hadron sources given by the quark and gluon\njets. Experimentally, for the grouping of the outgoing hadrons into jets there exist several\nmethods which differ somewhat in their results. Among the leading ones is the known Durham\nalgorithm [17], which has been applied to the hadronic Z 0 decay. The outcome of such a hadron\njet analysis, as obtained by the OPAL collaboration [18], is shown in Fig. 3 as a function of\nthe jet resolution parameter ycut . As can be seen, already for values of ycut \u2265 0.01, the data is\n\u221a\npredominantly limited by three hadron jets. In the following we will assume that at s \u2264 91\nGeV the e+ e\u2212 \u2192 hadrons annihilation is governed by not more than the three-jet configuration.\nIn the first next-to-leading process e+ e\u2212 \u2192 q q\u0304g, the differential cross section is given by\n(see e.g. Ref. [19]):\n2\u03b1s\n2\u03b1s\nx21 + x22\n1 d2 \u03c3\n=\n=\nWqqg (x1 , x2 ) .\n(7)\n\u03c3 dx1 dx2\n3\u03c0 (1 \u2212 x1 )(1 \u2212 x2 )\n3\u03c0\n\u221a\n\u221a\nHere x1 = 2Eq / s and x2 = 2Eq\u0304 / s. where Eq and Eq\u0304 are respectively the energies of\nthe outgoing quark and anti-quark jets. At this point it is important to realise that the term\n4\n\n\fFigure 3: The relative measured rate R of the produced hadron jets in the Z 0 decay, taken from\nreference [18], as a function of the jet resolution parameter ycut using the Durham algorithm. The\ndata which is corrected for all the OPAL detector deficiencies, but not for hadronisation effects, is\ncompared with two Monte Carlo models.\n\n\u221a\nWqqg (x1 , x2 ) is equivalent to the probability of finding a gluon with the energy Eg = s\u2212Eq \u2212Eq\u0304\nwhich here is utilised for the calculation of the dilution factors. The integration region associated to this differential cross section is defined by 0 \u2264 x1 , x2 \u2264 1 and x1 + x2 \u2265 1. Further\nto note is that the expression given by Eq. (7) diverges when either the gluon is collinear with\none of the outgoing quarks or the gluon momentum approaches zero. Some methods to handle\nin the integration these singularities are discussed e.g. in references [19, 20]. Here we deal with\nthis singularity by introducing to the x1 and x2 variables an upper limit of xmax = 0.99. To\nestimate the sensitivity of our calculations to this upper limit cutoff choice we also represent\nour analysis results using xmax = 0.95.\nFor the average charged multiplicity of the quark and anti-quark jets, in the process e+ e\u2212 \u2192\nq q\u0304g, it was found that its parametrisation is best given in terms of an appropriate scale defined\nas [21]\n!\n!\n\u03b8q\u0304g\n\u03b8qg\nand Qq\u0304g = Eq\u0304 sin\n,\n(8)\nQqg = Eq sin\n2\n2\nwhere Eq (Eq\u0304 ) is the energy of the quark (anti-quark) jet and \u03b8qg (\u03b8q\u0304g ) is the opening angle\nbetween the quark (anti-quark) jet and the gluon jet. The effective scale for the gluon is then\nQg =\n\nq\n\nQqg Qq\u0304g .\n\n(9)\n\nFor the dependence of the multiplicity on the scale Qjet we use the parametrisation given\n5\n\n\fin Refs. [19, 21], namely:\nhNq (Qjet )i = a0 + a1 lnQjet + a2 (lnQjet )2\n\n(10)\n\nhNg (Qjet )i = R0 + R1 hNq (Qjet )i ,\n\n(11)\n\nand\nwhere a0 = 2.74 \u00b1 0.07, a1 = 1.71 \u00b1 0.05, a2 = \u22120.05 \u00b1 0.07, R0 = \u22127.27 \u00b1 0.52 and\nR1 = 2.27 \u00b1 0.07. With the help of these two parametrisations one can calculate the 2-pion\ndilution factor Dqqg (x1 , x2 ), as defined in Eq. (3), for every set of x1 , x2 and xg = 2 \u2212 x1 \u2212 x2\nvalues assuming for simplicity that each jet charged multiplicity is equally divided into positive\nand negative pions. Thus the average 2-pion dilution factor hDqqg i, at a given e+ e\u2212 centre-ofmass energy, is equal to\nhDqqg i =\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nxmax\n\ndx2\n\nZ\n\nxmax\n\n1\u2212x2\n\nDqqg (x1 , x2 )Wqqg (x1 , x2 )dx1\n\n/\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nxmax\n\ndx2\n\nZ\n\nxmax\n\n1\u2212x2\n\nWqqg (x1 , x2 )dx1 .\n\n(12)\nThe average dilution factors hDqqg i were thus calculated at several s values in the range of\n10 to 91 GeV using the two xmax values of 0.99 and 0.95. Our results for the expected r\u03c0\u00b1 \u03c0\u00b1\ndependence on energy, using Eq. (6) and assuming a constant \u03bb value, are represented in Fig. 2\nby a band chosen to be normalised to the r value measured by ALEPH [22] at 91 GeV so as\nto cover also r measurements at lower energies. The lower and upper lines of the band, which\ncorrespond respectively to the xmax values of 0.99 and 0.95, are seen to be very similar in their\nshape. As can be seen, the expected dependence of r on the energy is weak and consistent with\nthe experimental observations in the energy range from 10 GeV up to the r values measured at\nthe Z 0 mass energy by the ALEPH and DELPHI collaborations. At the same time, in the frame\nwork of the hadron source approach, no relation can be achieved between the reported r values\n\u221a\nof L3 and OPAL at s = 91 GeV and those measured at lower energies. Finally important to\nnote is that whereas in the description of the jet multiplicity via Eqs. (10) and (11) the use of\nQjet scale is mandatory, [21], the average calculated dilution factor hDqqg i differs, in the 10 to\n91 GeV energy range, only by about 2% when the Qjet scale is replaced by the jet energy Ejet .\n\u221a\n\n3.1\n\nThe r\u03c0\u00b1 \u03c0\u00b1 value of the Z 0 decay into two and three jets\n\nThe dependence of the emitter size on the number of hadron jets in the Z 0 decays has been\nstudied by the OPAL collaboration [8] which found that the r value of the 3-jet events has a\nvalue which is higher by about 10% than that obtained for the 2-jet events. From the same\nstudy OPAL also reported that r increases with the observed charged multiplicity while the \u03bb\nparameter decreases. As mentioned before, the experimental separation between 2-jet and 3-jet\nevents depends on the method chosen and its parameters values and therefore its reproduction\nwith Eq. (7) is inaccessible. On the other hand, transition from a 2-jet to a 3-jet Z 0 decay configuration can be characterised, in the framework of the hadron source model, by an increase\nof Ng , the number of charged hadrons associated with the gluon jet. The expected ratio of\n6\n\n\f0\n\nr(Ng)/r(Z )\n\n1.05\n\n1\n\n0.95\n\n0.9\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\nNg\n\nFigure 4: The expected ratio r(Ng )/r(Z 0 ) of the hadronic Z 0 decay as a function of Ng , the gluon\njet charged multiplicity, as calculated from the hadron source approach.\n\nr(Ng )/r(Z 0 ), as obtained from the model using xmax = 0.99, is shown in Fig. 4 as a function of\nNg , where r(Z 0 ) is the dimension value obtained from the BEC analysis of the total Z 0 final\nstate hadrons. As seen, this ratio increases by about 10% from Ng of about three to values above\nseven where the ratio settles at a level of about \u223c1.02. Similar behaviour of r(Ng )/r(Z 0 ) is also\nseen when the value xmax = 0.95 is used in the calculations. Since r(Z 0 ) lies between the r values of the 2 and 3-jet events, the model expectation is consistent with the experimental findings.\nFor the comparison of the OPAL results for the r dependence on multiplicity at the Z 0 decay\n[8], with the hadronic jet source approach one requires above all a parametrisation of the hadron\nmultiplicity spectrum as a function of Qjet in addition to its average value hN(Qjet )i. For the\ngluon jet this requirement can be achieved by using its hadron multiplicity distributions given\nin [23] for several Qjet values. As for the quark jet, one can obtain the needed parametrisation\nby using the known average multiplicity versus Qjet and by assuming that the shape of the\nmultiplicity distribution is independent of the jet energy. With these parametrisations we find\nthat for a constant \u03bb the dimension r indeed increases with the true multiplicity. Nevertheless,\nit is not surprising that we are unable to reproduce the experimental findings in all their details\nand that for the following reasons. Firstly, the measured multiplicity given in [8] is the observed\none, which depends on the experimental setup and analysis procedures, whereas the hadron\njets parametrisations refer to the true multiplicity. Secondly, the measured chaoticity \u03bb is\nfound to decrease rather steeply with the multiplicity which may indicate an increase in the\nexperimental data contamination as the number of outgoing particles increases. Thirdly, the\npresent study has limited itself to the case where the decay configurations of more than three\nhadron jets can be neglected. While this assumption is supported by the OPAL analysis [18]\n7\n\n\f\u221a\neven at s = 91 GeV, as long as the BEC analysis embraces the whole final state hadrons,\nit may not be anymore valid when only the higher multiplicity part of the hadronic Z 0 decay\nevents is selected for the correlation study.\n\n3.2\n\nQuarkonium decay into hadrons\n\nQuarkonia, like the J/\u03c8(3.1) and the \u03a5(9.46), decay into hadrons predominantly via the three\ngluon (3g) mode, also referred to as the direct decay mode, which leads to three hadron jets. In\naddition, they also decay via the one photon, or vacuum polarisation, mode which is identical\nin its hadron jet configuration to that of the e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03b3/Z \u22c6 \u2192 q q\u0304g background underneath.\nThe J/\u03c8(3.1) mass is too low to be analysed here in terms of its hadron sources, mainly due\nto the uncertainty in the gluon and quark jet parametrisations below \u223c 1 \u2212 2 GeV. As for\nthe \u03a5(9.46), its mass may be considered just heavy enough to render, according to Eq. (6), a\nreliable estimate of the ratio\nhDqqg i \u03bb3g\nr3g\n=\n.\n(13)\nrqqg\nhD3g i \u03bbqqg\nTo calculate the dilution factor of the three gluon-jet configuration we consider the differential\n\u03a5(9.46) direct decay rate given by [24]\n1\n6\nd\u0393\n= 2\nW (x1 , x2 , x3 ) ,\n\u03933g dx1 dx2\n\u03c0 \u22129\n\n(14)\n\nwhere xj = 2Egj /m\u03a5 . Here W (x1 , x2 , x3 ) is given by [24]\nW (x1 , x2 , x3 ) =\n\n1\n[x21 (1 \u2212 x1 )2 + x22 (1 \u2212 x2 )2 + x23 (1 \u2212 x3 )2 ]\n2 2 2\nx1 x2 x3\n\n(15)\n\nwith the condition that x1 + x2 + x3 = 2. Whereas for the calculation of the average dilution\nfactor hDqqg i one has a well defined Qjet scale for the quarks and gluon jets as formulated in\nEqs. (10) and (11), not so for the three gluon configuration. However, as mentioned before, the\naverage dilution factors do change only by \u223c 2% when the Qjet scale is replaced by Ejet . This\nbeing the case we proceeded to calculated r3g /rqqg using the jet energy Ejet rather than the Qjet\nscale while incorporating a 2% uncertainty into our final result. The evaluation of the average\ndilution factor hD3g i is then carried out via Eq. (12) where Dqqg (x1 , x2 ) and Wqqg (x1 , x2 ) are\nreplaced respectively by D3g (x1 , x2 ) and W3g (x1 , x2 ). From these calculations and those carried\n\u221a\nout to obtain hDqqg i at s = 9.46 GeV, we find that the ratio hDqqg i/hD3g i is lying in the\nrange of 1.06 to 1.11 corresponding to the integration cutoff values xmax = 0.99 and 0.95.\nAn early BEC analysis of the CLEO collaboration [25] yielded the values of r(\u03a5 \u2192 3g) =\n0.99\u00b10.14 fm and r(\u03a5 \u2192 qqg) = 0.86\u00b10.15 fm so that their ratio is equal to 1.15\u00b10.26. A more\nrecent BEC measurements of e+ e\u2212 \u2192 hadrons at the \u03a5 mass energy, described in Ref. [26],\nquotes the values r(\u03a5 \u2192 3g) = 0.73 \u00b1 0.10 \u00b1 0.04 fm and r(\u03a5 \u2192 qqg) = 0.83 \u00b1 0.22 \u00b1 0.05\nfm, from which follows that r(\u03a5 \u2192 3g)/r(\u03a5 \u2192 qqg) = 0.88 \u00b1 0.28. To compare these results\n8\n\n\fwith the expectation of the hadron source approach one needs to know the true \u03bb3g and \u03bbqqg\nvalues. However as mentioned before, these are difficult to estimate due to the fact that\nthey are sensitive to the purity level of the experimental data sample. Inasmuch that \u03bb3g \u2248\n\u03bbqqg , an assumption supported by the analysis results reported in [26], the two independent\nmeasurements of r3g /rqqg are consistent within one standard deviation with the expectation of\nthe hadron source approach.\n\n4\n\nSummary\n\nThe dependence of the Bose-Einstein correlation of two identical bosons, produced in e+ e\u2212\nannihilations, on the configuration of the hadron sources has been taken over from the known\ncumulants dependence on these sources. Assuming that correlation exists only for hadrons\nemerging from the same source, leads to a BEC dilution whenever the hadron-pair emerges\nfrom two different sources. A relation between the amount of dilution and the BEC extracted\ndimension r is formulated. Specifically, we identify in the e+ e\u2212 annihilation the outgoing parti\u221a\ncle jets as the hadron sources which up to centre-of-mass energy of s = 91 GeV are essentially\nlimited to three.\nThe comparison of the hadron source approach to the experimental findings is somewhat\nhindered by the need to know the genuine values of the chaoticity \u03bb parameters, and in some of\nthe cases also the distribution of the true multiplicity, both as a function of the jet energy. In\naddition, the extension of the hadron source approach to e+ e\u2212 annihilations at energies above\n91 GeV seems to require the inclusion of configurations higher than three hadron jet sources\nwhich are not dealt with here.\nInsofar that \u03bb remains the same over the whole energy range from 10 to 91 GeV, the hadron\nsource approach expects the BEC extracted r value to be only slightly dependent on energy\nin accordance with the experimental observations. As for the hadronic Z 0 decay, the seen rise\nof r by some 10% when shifting from the two to the three hadron-jet configuration, is also\nexpected from the hadron source approach. Finally the model is consistent within errors with\nthe experimental findings for the ratio between the r values obtained for the three gluons and\nto the one photon hadronic decay modes of the \u03a5(9.46).\nAcknowledgements\nI would like to thank Y.
