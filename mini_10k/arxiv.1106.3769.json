Introduction and main results\nIn this paper, we use the symbol k for representing any finite nonnegative integer.\nFor g, l \u2265 0, let \u03a3 = \u03a3g,l denote an oriented compact connected surface with g\ngenus and l punctures, and set \u03a3g = \u03a3g,0 . For (\u221e >)n \u2265 2, let Fn denote a free\ngroup of rank n. We use e as the identity in a group. Unless otherwise stated, every\ngroup is assumed to be countable and discrete. For a group K, \u03bbK is the left regular\nrepresentation of K in l2 (K).\nThe main topic of this paper is homomorphism superrigidity into mapping class\ngroups MCG(\u03a3) of (orientable) surfaces and into outer automorphism groups Out(Fn )\nof (finitely generated) free groups of certain groups \u0393. By this terminology, we mean\nthat every group homomorphism from \u0393 into these groups has finite image. A\nbreakthrough was done by B. Farb and H. Masur [FaMas] in 1998 that states any\nirreducible higher rank lattice has homomorphism superrigidity into mapping class\ngroups. They employs a study of the Poisson boundary of mapping class groups\nby A. V. Kaimanovich and Masur [FaMas], and therefore this theorem is called the\nFarb-Kaimanovich\u2013Masur superrigidity. In 2010, M. R. Bridson and R. D. Wade\n[BrWa] settled the question for Out(Fn ) target case:\nTheorem 1.1. ([FaMas];[BrWa]) Let G = \u03a0m\ni=1 Gi (ki ), where ki are local field,\nGi (ki ) are ki -points of Zariski connected simple ki -algebraic group Gi .

Then for any irreducible lattice \u0393 in G, every homomorphism from\n\u0393 into MCG(\u03a3g ) (g \u2265 0); and into Out(Fn ) (n \u2265 2) have finite image.\ni\n\nFor their proofs, the Margulis Finiteness Property, hereafter we call the MFP,\nplays a fundamental role. This property states that every normal subgroup of an\nirreducible higher rank lattice is either finite or of finite index. Thanks to the MFP,\nthe proofs are reduced to showing that every homomorphism above must have infinite kernel. Note that Margulis has also shown that these lattices are arithmetic.\nIn this paper, we study some generalization of Theorem 1.1 to matrix groups over\ngeneral rings. The special linear group SLm (Z[x1 , . . . , xk ]) with m \u2265 3 over a finitely\ngenerated commutative polinomial ring over integers is called the universal lattice by\nY. Shalom [Sha1]. Although this group itself is not a lattice in semi-simple algebraic\ngroup (see Lemma 1.2) whenever k \u2265 1, it surjects onto higher rank lattices of the\nform of SLm (O) (, if corresponding k is\n\u221a large\n\u221a enough,) where O is an integer ring,\nsuch as SLm (Z), SLm (Z[1/2]), SLm (Z[ 2, 3]), and SLm (Fq [t]), where Fq denotes\nthe finite field of order q for q a positive power of a prime. Universal lattices are\nexpected to have certain properties which are common in the groups above, so that\nthey can be seen mother groups for these properties. For instance, Shalom [Sha4]\nand L. Vaserstein [Vas] have shown that universal lattices have property (T) of\nKazhdan [Kaz], see Sucsection 2.2 and Remark 4.9 for details.\nNow it is natural to ask whether universal lattices have homomorphism superrigidity into MCG(\u03a3) and Out(Fn ). We also deal with the symplectic version of\nthis question. More precisely, with following Shalom, we call the symplectic group\nSp2m (Z[x1 , . . . , xk ]) with m \u2265 2 the symplectic universal lattice and ask the same\nquestion to it. Note that Ershov\u2013Jaikin-Zapirain\u2013Kassabov [EJK] have shown symplectic universal lattices have (T), which plays a key role in this paper (see Section 4\nand Section 5). Our main result answers these question in the affirmative (note that\nSelberg lemma implies \u0393 in the statement below can be taken as a torsion-free group,\nbecause universal and symplectic universal lattices can be embedded(not discrete\nembedding) in special linear groups over C):\nTheorem A. Let \u0393 be a finite index subgroup either of SLm (Z[x1 , . . . , xk ]), m \u2265 3;\nor of Sp2m (Z[x1 , . . . , xk ]), m \u2265 2. Then for any g \u2265 0 and n \u2265 2, every homomorphism\n\u03a6 : \u0393 \u2192 MCG(\u03a3g )\nand every homomorphism\n\u03a8 : \u0393 \u2192 Out(Fn )\nhave finite image. In particular, every homomorphism \u0393 \u2192 MCG(\u03a3g,l ) (l \u2265 1)\nand \u0393 \u2192 Aut(Fn ) also have finite image.\nNote that the latter cases follow from the fact that there are natural injections\nMCG(\u03a3g,l ) \u0592\u2192 Out(F2g+l\u22121 ) if l \u2265 1, and Aut(Fn ) \u0592\u2192 Out(Fn+1 )\n\n(the first injection is given via actions on the fundamental group of \u03a3g,l ).\nThe homomorphism superrigidity above has strong connection to group actions\non low dimensional manifolds, which can be seen as a part of Zimmer's program.\nIndeed, for MCG(\u03a3) target case, the result states that every \u0393-action on a surface\nis finite up to isotopy. For Out(Fn ) target case, Farb and P. Shalen [FaSh] have\n\n\fSUPERIGIDITY INTO MCG\n\n3\n\nemployed this superrigidity to deduce certain rigidity of a action of an irreducible\nhigher rank lattice on a 3-manifolds. Thus Theorem A can be regarded as a mile\nstone to Zimmer's program for universal and symplectic universal lattices. As they\nare not realized as (arithmetic) lattices, we consider Theorem A as a certain nonarithmetization of Theorem 1.1.\nLet A be a finitely generated and commutative ring (we always assume rings to be\nassociative and unital). Since conclusion of Theorem A remains true if \u0393 is replaced\nwith any group quotient of \u0393, we obtain the same conclusion for \u0393 being a finite\nindex subgroup either of Em (A), m \u2265 3; or of Ep2m (A), m \u2265 2. Here Em (A) and\nEp2m (A) respectively denote the elementary group and the elementary symplectic\ngroup over A. For the definitions of them, see Section 4.\nLet us mention some difficulty in establishing Theorem A. As mentioned above,\na key to proving Theorem 1.1 is the MFP for irreducible higher rank lattices. More\nessentially, Bridson\u2013Wade [BrWa] have observed that if \u0393 is Z-averse, then homomorphism superrigidity follows. Here a group \u0393 is Z-averse if for any finite index\nsubgroup \u03930 of \u0393, no normal subgroup N of \u03930 has a surjective homomorphism onto\nZ. We, however, observe the following:\nLemma 1.2. Universal lattices and symplectic universal lattices with k \u2265 1 do not\nsatisfy the MFP. Moreover, they are not Z-averse.\nWe prove Lemma 1.2 (we set k = 1 for simplicity) by considering the congruence\nkernel N associated to the map Z[x] \u0589 Z;x 7\u2192 0. This N is infinite and infinite\nindex normal subgroup, and the map\nN \u0589 Z; g 7\u2192 (g \u2032 |x=0)1,1\n\nbecomes a homomorphism. Here \u2032 is a derivative: {xn }\u2032 = nxn\u22121 and (*)1,1 means\nthe (1, 1)-th entry.\nThere is another approach to show homomorphism superrigiity by M. Bestvina\nand K. Fujiwara [BeFu]. They study second bounded cohomology Hb2 (K; 1K , R), see\nSubsection 2.3, of subgroups K of mapping class groups with trivial coefficient and\ngive an alternative proof of [FaMas], see also \u00a73 of [BrWa] for Out(Fn ) target case.\nHowever, to the best of the author's knowledge, no results are known concerning\nsecond bounded cohomology of universal or symplectic universal lattices with trivial\ncoefficient, compare with Subsection 2.2 .\nIn this paper, we take the third approach, which is a modification of the second\none above, to overcome these difficulties to show Theorem A. Precisely, we study\nsecond bounded cohomology with unitary coefficients which does not contain the\ntrivial representation. Certain cases are studied by U. Hamenst\u00e4dt [Ham] for K 6\nMCG(\u03a3); and Bestvina\u2013Bromberg\u2013Fujiwara [BBF] for K 6 Out(Fn ), and these\nresults are crucial for the proof of Theorem A. We call a certain property (TT)/T\n(that means \"property (TT) modulo Trivial linear part\"), which relates to the\ncohomology above, see Subsection 2.2.\nIn short, the proof of Theorem A consists of the following two ingredients:\nTheorem 1.3. Let \u0393 be a countable discrete subgroup. If \u0393 has property (TT)/T,\nin the sense in Definition 2.5, then every homomorphism from G into MCG(\u03a3g,l )\n(g, l \u2265 0); or into Out(Fn ) (n \u2265 2) has finite image.\n\n\f4\n\nMASATO MIMURA\n\nTheorem 1.4. The symplectic universal lattices Sp2m (Z[x1 , . . . , xk ]), m \u2265 2;,as well\nas the universal lattices SLm (Z[x1 , . . . , xk ]), m \u2265 3, have property (TT)/T.\nThe statement above for universal lattices has proven in the previous paper [Mim1,\nRemark 6.7] of the author.\nWe furthermore obtain some generalization of Theorem A. Recall that Theorem 1.1 is easily deduced if a lattice \u0393 is noncocompact (because every solvable\nsubgroup of MCG(\u03a3) or of Out(Fn ) is virtually abelian, and because the MFP\nholds). For our case, it is much less trivial, but Theorem A for universal lattice\ncase can be shown in a simple argument, see Theorem C below. The following theorem shows that homomorphism superridigity remains valid even in certain measure\nequivalent setting (the author thanks Alex Furman for this formulation), in which\nthe simple argument might not apply any more :\nTheorem B. Let A be a finitely generated, commutative, associative and unital\nring. Let \u0393 be either of Em (A), m \u2265 3; or of Ep2m (A), m \u2265 2. Suppose a countable\ngroup \u039b satisfies the following two conditions:\n(i) \u039b is measure equivalent to \u0393;\n(ii) For an ergodic ME-coupling \u03a9 of (\u0393, \u039b), there exists \u039b-fundamental domain\nX \u2243 \u03a9/\u039b in \u03a9 such that the associated ME-cocycle \u03b1 : \u0393 \u00d7 X \u2192 \u039b satisfies\nthe L2 -condition. Namely, for any \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393,\n|\u03b1(\u03b3, *)|\u039b \u2208 L2 (X),\n\nwhere | * |\u039b denotes a word metric on \u039b with respect to a finite generating set\nfor \u039b.\nThen every homomorphism from \u039b into MCG(\u03a3g,l ) (g, l \u2265 0); or into Out(Fn )\n(n \u2265 2) has finite image.\nIn particular, the following holds true: let \u0393 be a finite index subgroup of Em (A),\nm \u2265 3; or of Ep2m (A), m \u2265 2. Suppose G be a locally compact and second countable\ngroup and G contains a group isomorphic to \u0393 as a lattice. Then for any cocompact\nlattice \u039b in G, every homomorphism from \u039b into MCG(\u03a3g,l ) (g, l \u2265 0); or into\nOut(Fn ) (n \u2265 2) has finite image.\nWe refer to Section 6 for definitions and details on ME. Note that in the latter\ncase, an ME-cocycle \u03b1 : \u0393 \u00d7 G/\u039b \u2192 \u039b satisfies L\u221e -condition for some choice of a\n\u039b-fundamental domain, and that it is stronger than the L2 -condition in item (ii).\nAlso we mention that \u039b is always finitely generated because \u0393 here has property (T),\nsee Subsection 2.2 and Subsection 4.3, which implies finite generation; and because\n(T) is an ME-invariant, see [Fur1].\nIn addition, we consider a generalization of properties (T) and (FH) of Bader\u2013\nFurman\u2013Gelander\u2013Monod concerning general Banach space B, which they call (TB )\nand (FB ). We note that for (\u221e >)p \u226b 2, property (FLp ), which represents the fixed\npoint property with respect to all affine isometric action on Lp spaces, is strictly\nstronger than (T) (, which is equivalent to (FL2 ) for locally compact second countable\ngroups). See Theorem 7.5 for details. We establish (FLp ), p \u2208 (1, \u221e) for symplectic\nuniversal lattices with m \u2265 3:\nTheorem 1.5. Let p \u2208 (1, \u221e). Then symplectic universal lattices Sp2m (Z[x1 , . . . , xk ])\nfor m \u2265 3, as well as universal lattices SLm (Z[x1 , . . . , xk ]) for m \u2265 4, have property\n\n\fSUPERIGIDITY INTO MCG\n\n5\n\n(FFLp )/T. In particular, these groups have property (FLp ). Here for each p, Lp\ndenotes the class of Lp spaces.\nThe statement above for universal lattices (for m \u2265 4) is one of the main results\nin the previous paper [Mim1, Theorem 1.5] of the author.\nFinally, as we mentioned above, Theorem A can be deduced in considerably simpler argument for universal lattice case. This argument uses the distortion of a\nfinitely generated group, and we moreover show the following generalization.\nTheorem C. Let \u0393 be a finite index subgroup of a noncommutative universal lattice\nEm (Zhx1 , . . . , xk i), m \u2265 3. Then every homomorphism from \u039b into MCG(\u03a3g,l )\n(g, l \u2265 0); or into Out(Fn ) (n \u2265 2) has finite image.\nIt follows that the same conclusion holds if \u0393 is a finite index subgroup of Em (R),\nm \u2265 3, for any finitely generated ring R. However, we have no idea what happens\nif we consider \u039b in the setting in Theorem B for A = R noncommutative. Also,\nwe warn that at the moment the proof of Theorem C does not work for symplectic\nuniversal lattices. See Remark 8.4.\nRemark 1.6. Homomorphism superrigidity into mapping class groups can be combined with Roydon's theorem that the full isometry group of the Teichm\u00fclar space\nos the mapping class group; and with Kerchoff's solution to the Nielson Realization\nConjecture. Thus we have the following corollary:\nCorollary 1.7. Let \u0393 be either as in Theorem A; as in Theorem C; or as \u039b in\nTheorem B. Then any isometric action of \u0393 on a Teichm\u00fcller space has a global\nfixed point.\nOrganization of this paper: Section 2 is for preliminaries of MCG(\u03a3), Out(Fn );\nproperty (T); and bounded cohomology. The definition of property (TT)/T is recalled there. Section 3 is devoted to the proof of Theorem 1.3. In Section 4, we treat\nfundamental results on symplectic universal lattices, with explaining some difference\nfrom universal lattices. In Section 5, we prove a key theorem, Theorem 5.1, to establish Theorem 1.4. To deduce Theorem 1.4 from Theorem 5.1, a certain property,\nwhich is written as (\u2217) there, shall play an imortant role. We thus obtain Theorem A\nby combining Theorem 1.3 and Theorem 1.4. In Section 6, we treat measure equivalence and show Theorem B. Section 7 is employed to recall definitions of property\n(TB ) and (FB ), and to prove Theorem 1.5. In Section 8, we introduce a shortcut\nargument for Theorem A for universal lattices, which is based on distorted elements\nin finitely generated groups. There we will prove Theorem C.\nacknowledgments\nThe author is indebted to his Ph.D advisor Narutaka Ozawa and posdoc advisor\nMasahiko Kanai for their suggestions.

Mapping class groups and automorphism groups of free groups. Let\n\u03a3 = \u03a3g,l for g, l \u2265 0. The mapping class group of \u03a3 is defined as MCG(\u03a3) :=\nHomeo+ (\u03a3)/isotopy. Here a mapping class is allowed to permute punctures, and\nisotopies can rotate a neighborhood of a puncture. We say the surface \u03a3 = \u03a3g,l\nis non-exceptional if 3g + l \u2265 5 holds, and say it is exceptional otherwise. For\nn \u2265 2, Aut(Fn ) denotes the automorphism group of Fn and Out(Fn ) denotes the\nouter automorphism group of Fn , namely, Out(Fn ) := Aut(Fn )/Inn(Fn ).\nIt is a classical fact that MCG(\u03a3) is a finitely generated group , and in fact it is\nfinitely presented (see for instance Chapter 6 of a forthcoming book [FaMar] of Farb\u2013\nMargalit). Also, Nielsen has given finite presentations for Out(Fn ) and Aut(Fn ). For\ncomprehensive treatment for MCG(\u03a3); and Out(Fn ), we refer to a survay of N. V.\nIvanov [Iva] and [FaMar]; and surveys of K. Vogtmann [Vog].\nVia intersection numbers for \u03a3g ; and abelianization for Fn respectively, we have\nthe following surjections for g \u2265 1 and n \u2265 2:\nMCG(\u03a3g ) \u0589 Sp2g (Z); Out(Fn ) \u0589 GLn (Z).\nThe Torelli groups Tg E MCG(\u03a3g ); and IAn E Out(Fn ) are defined as the kernel\nof the surjections above repsectively (the symbol IA stands for \"identity on the\nabelianization\").\nFrom this point, we collect some facts needed for the proof of Theorem 1.3. First\nwe need element classification for MCG(\u03a3) and Out(Fn ). The well-known classification theorem of Nielson\u2013Thurston gives an element classification for MCG(\u03a3):\neach f \u2208 MCG(\u03a3) is either a torsion; reducible; or pseudo-Anosov. Here f is said\nto be reducible if it fixes some curve system, a collection of isotopy classes of essential (not homotopic to one point nor homotopic to a boundary component) simple\nclosed curves that are pairwise disjoint. A basic example of a reducible element is\nthe Dehn twist along an essential simple closed curve. A mapping class f is said\nto pseudo-Anosov if f fixes exactly two points in the projective space PMF(\u03a3) of\nmeasured foliation on \u03a3 (see for instance [FaMar] for details). In this case the action of f on PMF(\u03a3) has a north-south dynamics. For two pseudo-Anosov element\nf1 , f2 \u2208 MCG(\u03a3), we say they are independent if the fixed point sets (in PMF (\u03a3))\nare disjoint.\nA similar concept to an pseudo-Anosov element (in MCG(\u03a3)) is defined in Out(Fn )\ncase, and it is called a fully irreducible element: A subgroup L 6 Fn is called a free\nfactor of Fn if there exists L\u2032 6 Fn such that the free product L \u22c6 L\u2032 is isomorphic\n\n\fSUPERIGIDITY INTO MCG\n\n7\n\nto Fn . An element f in Out(Fn ) is said to be fully irreducible if no non-zero power\nof f fixes the set of conjugacy classes of any free factor of Fn . A theorem of Levitt\u2013\nLustig [LeLu] states that if f is fully irreducible, then it acts on PT with exactly two\nfixed points with north-south dynamics. Here PT denotes Culler\u2013Morgan's equivalent compactification PT [CuMo] of Vuller\u2013Vogtmann's outer space [CuVo], and\nthis can be seen an analogue of PMF(\u03a3) in MCG(\u03a3) case. Two fully irreducible\nelements are said to be independent if their fixed point sets (in PT ) are disjoint.\nSecondly, we need subgroup classification for these groups. The following two\ntheorems play roles:\nTheorem 2.1. (McCarthy\u2013Papadopoulos [McPa]) Let \u03a3 = \u03a3g,l be a surface. Then\neach K 6 MCG(\u03a3) satisfies either of the following:\n(i) the group K is finite;\n(ii) the group K is reducible. That means, there exists an H-preserved curve\nsystem C on \u03a3;\n(iii) the group K has a pseudo-Anosov element, but there are no two independent\npseudo-Anosov elements in K. In this case, K is virtually Z;\n(iv) the group K contains two independent pseudo-Anosov elements.\nTheorem 2.2. (Handel\u2013Mosher [HaMo]) Let n \u2265 2. Then each K 6 Out(Fn )\nsatisfies either of the following:\n(i) the group K is not fully irreducible, in the sense of Handel\u2013Mosher. This\nmeans, for some finite index subgroup K0 6 K, there exists a free factor\nL 6 Fn with L 6= {e} such that each element of H0 preserves the set of\nconjugacy classes in L;\n(ii) the group K has a fully irreducible element, but there are no two independent\nfully irreducible elements in H. In this case, K is virtually Z;\n(iii) the group K contains two independent fully irreducible elements.\nFinally, we state the following theorem of Bass\u2013Lubotzky [BaLu] (another proof\nis given by Bridson\u2013Wade [BrWa]) on IAn .\nTheorem 2.3. (Bass\u2013Lubotzky [BaLu]) Any nontrivial subgroup of IAn maps onto\nZ.\n2.2. Property (T), (TT), (TT)/T. In this subsection, we only treat countable\ngroups (in a similar way we can treat locally compact and second countable groups).\nLet (\u03c0, H) be a unitary representation of a group G. A map b : G \u2192 H is called\na \u03c0-(1-)cocycle if for any g, h \u2208 G, b(gh) =b(g) + \u03c0(g)b(h) holds (this condition is\nequivalent to that \u03b1(g) * \u03be:= \u03c0(g)\u03be + b(g) becomes an affine isometric action of G\non H). A \u03c0-cocycle is called a \u03c0-coboundary if there exists \u03b7 \u2208 H such that for any\ng \u2208 G, b(g) = \u03b7 \u2212 \u03c0(g)\u03b7 holds (this means the associated affine isometric action has\na global fixed point). We define the first group cohomology as\nH 1 (G; \u03c0) := {\u03c0-cocycles}/{\u03c0-coboundaries}.\nA map b : G \u2192 H is called a quasi-\u03c0-(1-)cocycle if\nsup kb(gh) \u2212 b(g) \u2212 \u03c0(g)b(h)k < \u221e.\n\ng,h\u2208G\n\n\f8\n\nMASATO MIMURA\n\nBy definition, any linear combination of \u03c0-cocycles and bounded maps G \u2192 H is a\nquasi-\u03c0-cocycle. The following quotient vector space measures how many there are\n\"non-trivial\" quasi-\u03c0-cocycles:\ng\nQH(G;\n\u03c0) := {quasi-\u03c0-cocycles}/({\u03c0-cocycles} + {bounded maps}).\n\nNote that thanks to uniform convexity of Hilbert spaces, a cocycle is a coboundary\nif and only if it is bounded (see also Lemma 2.2.7 in [BHV]).\nDefinition 2.4. Let G be a countable group.\n(1) A unitary G-representation (\u03c0, H) is said to weakly contain 1G , written as \u03c0 \u0017 1G\nif \u03c0 has almost invariant vectors. Here \u03c0 is said to have almost invariant vectors\nif for any \u01eb > 0 and any finite subset S \u2286 G there exists \u03be \u2208 H such that\nmax k\u03be \u2212 \u03c0(s)\u03bek < \u01ebk\u03bek.\ns\u2208S\n\n(2)\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\n(5)\n\n(6)\n\nIf G is finitely generated, then one can fix S in above as an (arbitrarily taken)\nfinite generating subset.\n(Kazhdan [Kaz]) G is said to have property (T) if whenever a unitary Grepresentation \u03c0 satisfies \u03c0 \u0017 1G , \u03c0 \u2287 1G (namely, H\u03c0(G) 6= 0) holds.\nLet H be a subgroup of G. The pair G > N is said to have relative property (T)\nif whenever a unitary G-representation \u03c0 satisfies \u03c0 \u0017 1G , \u03c0 |H \u2287 1H (namely,\nH\u03c0(H) 6= 0) holds.\nA group G is said to have property (FH) if for any any unitary G-representation\n\u03c0, H 1 (G; \u03c0) = 0. This means that every cocycle into any unitary G-representation\nis a coboundary. This condition is equivalent to that every cocycle into any unitary G-representation is bounded (see the sentence above from this definition).\n(Monod [Mon1]) G is said to have property (TT) if every quasi-cocycle into any\nunitary G-representation is bounded. This is equivalent to the following two\nconditions:\n(1) for any unitary G-representation \u03c0, H 1 (G; \u03c0) = 0;\ng\n(2) for any unitary G-representation \u03c0, QH(G;\n\u03c0) = 0.\nLet U be a subset of G. We say the pair G \u2287 U has relative property (TT) if\nevery quasi-cocycle into any unitary G-representation is bounded on U.\n\nIn the previous paper of the author [Mim1], a certain weaker version of property\n(TT) is defined as follows:\nDefinition 2.5. ([Mim1]) A countable group G is said to have property (TT)/T\n((TT) modulo T) if for any unitary G-representation with \u03c0 6\u2287 1G , every quasi-\u03c0cocycle is bounded. This is equivalent to the following two conditions:\n(a) for any unitary G-representation \u03c0 with \u03c0 6\u2287 1G , H 1 (G; \u03c0) = 0;\ng\n(b) for any unitary G-representation \u03c0 with \u03c0 6\u2287 1G , QH(G;\n\u03c0) = 0.\nThe celebrated Delorme\u2013Guichardet theorem asserts that property (T) is equivalent to property (FH) (for locally compact and second countable groups), see \u00a72.12\nin [BHV]. In view of this, Monod called the \"quasification\" of property (FH) property (TT). Property (TT) relates bounded cohomology of groups (and this is the\nmotivation of Burger and Monod to introduce this), see the next subsection.\n\n\fSUPERIGIDITY INTO MCG\n\n9\n\nProperty (T) represents strong rigidity of a group (for examples, see below). One\ncounterpart of (T) is Gromov's a-T-menability, or the Haagerup property, which\nstates an existence of a metrically proper cocycle into a unitary representation (recall\na map b : G \u2192 H is said to be metrically proper if for any M > 0, kb(g)k > M for\nall g \u2208 G away from some compact subset). By definition, one has the following:\nLemma 2.6. Let G and H be countable groups. Suppose G has (T) and H has the\nHaagerup property. Then every homomorphism from G into H has finite image.\nMoreover, note that (T) implies finite generation of the group.\nWe note that all amenable groups (including virtually abelian groups) and free\ngroups (and virtually free groups) have the Haagerup property. Here we note that\n(T)(\u21d4 (FH)) passes to group quotients (which is trivial), and passes to finite index\nsubgroups (for which we use induction). For property (TT)/T, the same stability\nholds:\nLemma 2.7. Property (TT)/T passes to group quotients and to finite index subgroups.\nFor the proof of heredity to finite index subgroups, we observe first that if G > G0\nand G0 -representation \u03c3 6\u2287 1G0 , then the induction IndG\nG0 \u03c3 6\u2287 1G . Secondly that from\na finite index subgroup, one can induce quasi-cocycles without any problem. We\nnote that it is not known whether (TT)/T is an ME-invariant, see Section 6 for\ndetails.\nA basic example of (infinite) groups with (T) is a totally higher rank lattice, a\nlattice in a semi-simple algebraic group over local fields with each factor having local\nrank \u2265 2, such as SLm (Z), m \u2265 3 and Sp2m (Z[1/2]), m \u2265 2 (a well-known example\nof relative property (T) is SL2 (Z) \u22c9 Z2 > Z2 , and SL2 (Z) \u22c9 Z2 itself does not have\n(T)). In fact, a totally higher rank lattice has property (TT) [BuMo]. It is known\nthat a lattice in Spm,1 , m \u2265 2 and some hyperbolic group (such as some random\ngroups and Spn,1 , n \u2265 2) have property (T). However, any hyperbolic H group\nfails to have (TT)/T because Mineyev\u2013Monod\u2013Shalom [MMS] have shown that H\ng\nsatisfies QH(H;\n\u03bbH ) 6= 0 (in fact it is infinite dimensional) unless H is virtually\nZ. Here \u03bbH denotes the left regular representation. As is stated as Theorem 1.4,\nuniversal lattices and symplectic universal lattices have (TT)/T. However to the\nbest knowledge of the author, it is not known whether they have (TT) (this is the\nmotivation to define (TT)/T). The following is a special case of a lemma in [Mim3],\nbut we state it here for the convenience:\nLemma 2.8. For countable groups, (TT)/T implies (T).\nProof. Let G be a group with (TT)/T. Then we know that for any unitary representation \u03c0 6\u2287 1G , H 1 (G; \u03c0) = 0. To verify (T), it suffices to show that the\nabelianization H := G/[G, G] is finite.\nSuppose H happens to be infinite. Then since H is infinite abelian, \u03bbH 6\u2287 1H\nbut \u03bbH \u0017 1H (the latter follows from amenability of H, see Appendix G in [BHV]).\nThese show that H 1 (H; \u03bbH ) 6= 0, see \u00a73.a in [BFGM]. By pulling-back through\nG \u0589 H, we have a unitary G-representation \u03c0 6\u2287 1G with H 1 (G; \u03c0) 6= 0. This is a\ncontradiction.\n\u0003\n\n\f10\n\nMASATO MIMURA\n\nTo sum up, we have the following implications between (T), (TT), and (TT)/T:\n(TT) =\u21d2 (TT)/T\n\n=\u21d2\n6\u21d0=\n\n(T).\n\nQuestion 2.9. Does property (TT)/T imply (TT)? In particular, do universal latg with trivial representation\ntices and symplectic universal lattices have vanishing QH\ncoefficients?\n\ng\nThe positive answer will imply vanishing of QH(G;\n1G , R) and vanishing of the\nstable commutator length on G being a universal lattices or symplectic universal\nlattices, see [Cal] on these topics. Ver partial result is obtained for universal lattices\nof degree \u2265 6, see Remark 5.8 for details.\n\n2.3. Bounded cohomology and non-vanishing results. We shortly state the\nrelation between (TT) (and (TT)/T) and bounded cohomology. We refer [BuMo],\n[Mon1] and [Mon2] for comprehensive treatment. For a countable group G and a\nHilbert (unitary) G-module (\u03c0, H), the bounded cohomology Hb\u2022(G; \u03c0, H) = H \u2022 (G; \u03c0)\nis defined to be the cohomology of the (homogeneous) complex\n0 \u2212\u2192 l\u221e (G; H)G \u2212\u2192 l\u221e (G2 ; H)G \u2212\u2192 l\u221e (G3 ; H)G \u2212\u2192 * * *\n\nof bounded invariant functions with the usual coboundary map. This complex is\nthe complex of bounded functions, which is a subcomplex of the standard (homogeneous) bar complex for the ordinary group cohomology. Therefore there is a natural\nhomomorphism\n\u03a8\u2022 : Hb\u2022 (G; \u03c0) \u2192 H \u2022 (G; \u03c0),\nwhich is called the comparison map. Note that \u03a8\u2022 is neither injective nor surjective\ng\nin general. The space QH(G;\n\u03c0) relates to bounded cohomology by the following\nwell-known lemma:\nLemma 2.10. In the setting of the paragraph above, the following map\ng\nQH(G;\n\u03c0) \u2192 Ker\u03a82 {Hb2 (G; \u03c0) \u2192 H 2(G; \u03c0)}; [b] 7\u2192 [\u03b4b]b\n\ngives an isomorphism between vector spaces. Here [*]b means the bounded cohomology\nclass, and \u03b4 is the coboundary map.\nHence if G has (TT), then for any unitary G-representation \u03c0, Hb2 (G; \u03c0) naturally\ninjects into H 2 (G; \u03c0).\nIn this paper, we concentrate ourselves to unitary representations \u03c0 with \u03c0 6\u2287 1G\ng (and hence of H 2 )\nin relation to (TT)/T. Some notable non-vanishing results of QH\nb\nfor certain subgroups of MCG(\u03a3) and of Out(Fn ) have been obtained respectively\nby U. Hamenst\u00e4dt and a forthcoming work of Bestvina\u2013Bromberg\u2013Fujiwara. These\nare keys to the proof of Theorem 1.3, and we state them.\nTheorem 2.11. (Hamenst\u00e4dt [Ham, Corollary B, Proposition 5.1]) Let \u03a3 = \u03a3g,l be\na non-exceptional (, namely, 3g + l \u2265 5) surface. Let K 6 MCG(\u03a3). Suppose K\ncontains two independent pseudo-Anosov elements. Then\ng\nQH(K;\n\u03bbK , l2 (K)) 6= 0,\n\nholds. In fact, it is infinite dimensional.\n\n\fSUPERIGIDITY INTO MCG\n\n11\n\nTheorem 2.12. (Bestvina\u2013Bromberg\u2013Fujiwara [BBF]) Let n \u2265 2 and K 6 Out(Fn ).\nSuppose K contains two independent fully irreducible elements. Then\ng\nQH(K;\n\u03bbK , l2 (K)) 6= 0,\n\nholds. In fact, it is infinite dimensional.\n\nHamenst\u00e4dt's proof of Theorem 2.11 uses the hyperbolicity of the curve graph\nC(\u03a3) of non-exceptional \u03a3 [MaMi] and the fact that the action MCG(\u03a3) y C(\u03a3) is\nacylindrical [Bow], for details see [Ham]. The approach of Bestvina\u2013Bromberg\u2013\nFujiwara is to examine actions on a quasi-tree (a metric space which is quasiisometric to a tree, see [Man]).\n3. Property (TT)/T implies homomorphism superrigidity\nNow we are in position to prove Theorem 1.3. Before proceeding in the proof of it,\nwe expalin idea by showing the following \"baby case\" (the author thanks Takefumi\nKondo for this suggestion):\nProposition 3.1. Suppose a group \u0393 have (TT)/T. Then for a hyperbolic group\nH, every homomorphism \u0393 \u2192 H has finite image.\nThe proof of Proposition 3.1 goes as follows: let K be the image of \u0393 \u2192 H. Recall\nby Lemma 2.7 and Lemma 2.8, K has (TT)/T and in particular (T). We appeal\nto a subgroup classification for hyperbolic groups: if K is elementary hyperbolic (,\nnamely, virtually Z), then K must be finite thanks to (T) for K and to Lemma 2.6.\ng\nIf not, then [MMS] states that QH(K;\n\u03bbK ) is non-zero (in fact infinite dimensional),\nbut this contradicts (TT)/T for K. This ends our proof.\nWe note that in the following proof, the argument of MCG(\u03a3) target case is a\nstandard argument in this field, and the argument of Out(Fn ) target case is based\non the argument in the work in [BrWa].\nProof. (Theorem 1.3) We deal with the first two statements of the theorem. Recall by Lemma 2.7 that \u03a6(\u0393) and \u03a8(\u0393) has (TT)/T (and in particular (T) by\nLemma 2.8).\nCase1. with target of mapping class groups\nLet \u03a6 : \u0393 \u2192 MCG(\u03a3g ) be a homomorphism. First, we note that for exceptional\ncases the conclusion holds by Lemma 2.6. Therefore, hereafter, we assume every\nsurface which appears in this proof is non-exceptional.\nLet K 6 MCG(S) be the image of \u03a6. We employ Theorem 2.1, the subgroup\nclassification result of [McPa]. For convenience we restate here: K is either of the\nfollowing forms:\n(i) the group K is finite;\n(ii) the group K is reducible: there exists a K-invarinat curve system C;\n(iii) the group K is virtually Z;\n(iv) the group K contains two independent pseudo-Anosov elements.\nThen we appeal to Theorem 2.11 of Hamenst\u00e4dt, and exclude option (iv). This\npart is the key in this proof. More precisely, K has property (TT)/T. However, if\noption (iv) occurs, then by Theorem 2.11,\ng\nQH(K;\n\u03bbK ) 6= 0.\n\n\f12\n\nMASATO MIMURA\n\nSince option (iv) (or the condition above already) implies that K is infinite. Therefore \u03bbK + 1K . This contradicts (TT)/T for K.\nProperty (T) excludes option (iii) (Lemma 2.6). Therefore for the proof, it suffices\nto show that K must be virtually abelian in option (ii).\nSuppose option (ii) occurs. Take a maximal curve system C preserved by K. Cut\n\u03a3 open along C and replace each boundary circle of the resulting bordered surface\nwith a puncture. Then we get a possibly disconnected surface \u03a3\u2032 . Let \u03a3\u20321 , . . . , \u03a3\u2032n\nbe connected components of \u03a3\u2032 . Then there is a homomorphism:\nK \u0589 K \u2032 6 (MCG(\u03a3\u20321 ) \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 MCG(\u03a3\u2032n )) \u22ca S \u2212\u2192 S.\nHere S is a subgroup of Sn , the symmetric group of degree n, and S acts by\npermutations on mapping class groups of homeomorphic surfaces among \u03a3\u20321 , . . . , \u03a3\u2032n .\nAnd the second homomorphism is the projection to S. It is known the kernel of the\nmap K \u2192 K \u2032 is a free abelian group, generated by multiple Dehn twists associated\nto the curves of the curve system C (for instance, see Chapter 4 of [Iva]). Take the\nkernel K0\u2032 E K \u2032 of the map K \u2032 \u2192 S. Then there is a natural map from K0\u2032 to each\nMCG(\u03a3\u2032i ), which takes the i-th component.\nNote that by definition K0\u2032 is a finite index subgroup of K \u2032 and hence has (TT)/T.\nTherefore again Theorem 2.11 tells us that each image of K0\u2032 inside MCG(\u03a3\u2032i ) is\neither finite or reducible. However it cannot be reducible. Indeed, if an image of K0\u2032\nfixes some curve system on \u03a3\u2032i , then by translation by S we have a curve system\non \u03a3\u20321 \u222a * * * \u222a \u03a3\u2032n which is preserved by K \u2032 . This contradicts the maximality of C.\nTherefore \u039b\u20320 must be finite, and thus \u039b is virtually abelian. Property (T) ends our\nproof.\nCase2. with target of outer automorphism groups Recall from Subsection 2.1 the definition of IAn E Out(Fn ). First we note that the conclusion holds\nfor n = 2 because then Out(Fn ) \u223c\n= GL2 (Z) has the Haagerup property.\nLet K 6 Out(Fn ) be the image of \u0393 by \u03a8. Firstly, we appeal to Theorem 2.2,\nthe classification of subgroups in Out(Fn ) by Handel\u2013Mosher [HaMo]: a subgroup\nK 6 Out(Fn ) is either of the following forms:\n(i) the group K is not fully irreducible: there exists a finite index subgroup which\npreserves each conjugacy class of some proper free factor of Fn ;\n(ii) the group K s virtually Z;\n(iii) the group K contains two independent fully irreducible elements.\nSecondly, we appeal to Theorem 2.12 of Bestvina\u2013Bromberg\u2013Fujiwara and exclude\noption (ii). This is done in a similar manner to one in Case 1. Property (T) excludes\noption (i). We shall show that a finite index subgroup K0 6 K as in option (2)\nmust be finite, by induction on n.\nIf n = 2, then we have seen it. Suppose the assertion holds true for every natural\nnumber < n, and we will verify the case of n. We take K0 6 K and a free factor\nL (with L\u2032 6 Fn such that L \u22c6 L\u2032 \u223c\n= Fn ) as in option (ii). Then for any [f ] \u2208 K0 ,\none can choose an element gf \u2208 Fn such that f (L) = gf \u22121 Lgf holds. Then the\nmap L \u220b h7\u2192 gf hgf \u22121 \u2208 L is an element of Aut(L), and the image in Out(L) is\nuniquely determined by [f ] \u2208 K0 . This induces a well-defined group homomorphism\nK0 \u2192 Out(L). Likewise, the action on Fn /hhLii induces a homomorphism K0 \u2192\nOut(L\u2032 ). Because the ranks of L and L\u2032 are strictly less than n, the assumption of\n\n\fSUPERIGIDITY INTO MCG\n\n13\n\ninduction applies. Hence both images are finite. By taking abelianization of L \u22c6 L\u2032 ,\nwith respect to the union of basis for L and L\u2032 the action of K0 is of the following\nform:\n\u0013\n\u0012\nG 0\n,\n\u2217 G\u2032\nwhere both G and G\u2032 are finite. Hence the image of the homomorphism K0 \u2192\nGLn (Z) is virtually abelian. Since K0 is a finite index subgroup of K, K0 has\n(TT)/T and in particular has (T). By combining these two, we have the image is\nin fact finite. Therefore, the kernel K0\u2032 of the map above is a finite index subgroup\nof K0 .\nNote that K0\u2032 is in IAn . Finally we appeal to Theorem 2.3 of Bass\u2013Lubotzky and\nBridson\u2013Wade that every nontrivial subgroup in IAn surjects onto Z. On the other\nhand, K0\u2032 is a finite index subgroup of K0 and hence has property (T). Therefore\nK0\u2032 must be trivial by Lemma 2.6, and thus K is finite. This ends our proof.\n\u0003\nQuestion 3.2. (This question has been asked by D. Fisher) Is property (T) enough\nto deduce the homomorphism superrigidity into MCG(\u03a3)?\nThere are two facts which support this question. First, J. E. Anderson [And]\nasserts that mapping class groups do not have (T). Secondly, S.-K. Yeung has shown\nthat a lattice in Spm,1 with m \u2265 2 (which has (T)) has homomorphism superrigidity\ninto mapping class groups. Concerning Out(Fn ), it seems that analogous problems\nare widely open.\n4. Symplectic universal lattices\nBefore proceeding to symplectic case, let us shortly recall the definition of elementary groups and universal lattices. For m \u2265 2 and a unital (associative) ring\nR (possibly noncommutative), elementary matirx in Mm (R) is a matrix of the form\nEi,j (r) := Im + rei,j (1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 m, i 6= j; r \u2208 R), here ei,j is the matrix with 1 in\n(i, j)-th entry and 0 in the other entries. The elementary group, denoted by Em (R),\nis the multiplicative group in Mm (R) generated by elementary matrices. Observe\nthe Steinberg commutator relation\n[Ei,j (r), Ej,l (s)] = Ei,l (rs) i 6= j 6= l; r, s \u2208 R.\n\nThen it follows that if m \u2265 3 and R is a finitely generated ring with the generating\nset {r1 , . . . , rk }, then Em (R) is a finitely generated group with a finite generating\nset\n{Ei,j (rt ) : 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 m, i 6= j; 1 \u2264 t \u2264 k}.\nThe elementary group for R = Z[x1 , . . . , xk ] with m \u2265 3 is called the universal\nlattice. The Suslin stability theorem [Sus] states that in that case, Em coincides\nwith the whole group SLm .\n4.1. One realization for elementary symplectic groups. Firstly, for m \u2265 1,\nwe take the 2m by 2m alternating matrix as\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nL 0 0\nLm = \uf8ed 0 . . . 0 \uf8f8 \u2208 M2m .\n0 0 L\n\n\f14\n\nMASATO MIMURA\n\nHere\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n0 1\nL=\n\u2208 M2 .\n\u22121 0\nThis choice of alternating matrix is standard, but in connection to property (T),\nthis choice is not good. Hence this alternating matrix Lm later shall be replaced\nwith another one Jm in this thesis. See the next subsection for details.\nLet A be a commutative ring (commutativity is needed here because we consider\nthe transpose). Then the symplectic group over A of degree 2m is the following\ngroup:\nSp2m (A) = {g \u2208 M2 m(A) : t gLm g = Lm }.\nHere t g is the transpose matrix of g. We use the following permutation symbol on\nZ:(2i)\u2032 := 2i \u2212 1; (2i \u2212 1)\u2032 = 2i (i \u2208 N). For any (i, j) with 1 \u2264 i \u2264 2m, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 2m\nand i 6= j; and any a \u2208 A, we define the elementary symplectic matrix as follows:\n\u001a\nI2 m + aei,j\nif i = j \u2032 ;\nSEi,j (a) :=\nI2 m + aei,j \u2212 (\u22121)i+j aej \u2032 ,i\u2032 if i 6= j \u2032 .\n\nHere ei,j is the matrix with (i, j)-th entry 1 and the other entries 0. The elementary\nsymplectic group over A of degree 2m is the group generated by all elementary\nsymplectic matrices, and it is written as Ep2m (A). A priori, Ep2m (A) is a (possibly\nnon-proper) subgroup of Sp2m (A).\nThen there are some basic commutator relations between elementary symplectic\nmatrices. They are so many, and here we only state some important relations. For\nthe all precise relations, we refer to Lemma 4.1 of the paper [GMV] of Grunewald\u2013\nMenniche\u2013Vaserstein.\nLemma 4.1. Let a, b \u2208 A are any element. Then there are the following formulae:\n(i) (1) [SEi,i\u2032 (a), SEi\u2032 ,l (b)] = SEi,l (ab)SEl\u2032 ,l ((\u22121)i+l ab2 ),\nif i 6= l, i\u2032 6= l.\n(2) [SEi,i\u2032 (a), SEk,i\u2032 (b)] = SEi,i\u2032 (2ab + (\u22121)i+k ab2 ),\nif i 6= k, i\u2032 6= k.\n(3) [SEi,i\u2032 (a), SEk,i (b)] = SEk,i\u2032 (\u2212ab)SEk,k\u2032 (\u2212(\u22121)i+k ab2 ),\nif i 6= k, i\u2032 6= k.\n(4) [SEi,i\u2032 (a), SEi,l (b)] = SEl\u2032 ,l (\u22122ab \u2212 (\u22121)i+l ab2 ),\nif i 6= l, i\u2032 6= l.\n(ii) (1) [SEi,j (a), SEj,l (b)] = SEi,l (ab),\nif i\u2032 6= j, j \u2032 6= l, i 6= l, i\u2032 6= l.\n(2) [SEi,j (a), SEj,l (b)] = SEi,l (2ab),\nif i\u2032 6= j, j \u2032 6= l, i 6= l, i\u2032 = l.\n(3) [SEi,j (a), SEk,j \u2032 (b)] = SEk,i\u2032 ((\u22121)i+j ab),\nif i\u2032 6= j, j \u2032 6= k, i\u2032 6= k, i 6= k.\n(4) [SEi,j (a), SEk,j \u2032 (b)] = SEi,i\u2032 (2(\u22121)i+j ab),\nif i\u2032 6= j, j \u2032 6= k, i\u2032 6= k, i = k.\nThese relation implies that if m \u2265 2, then whenever A is finitely generated (as a\nring), Ep2m (A) is a finitely generated group. However, we warn that we need some\ncare on a finite generating set of Ep2m (A). If one looks Lemma 4.1 carefully, then\none will notice that some rules are different between elementary symplectic matrices\nof the form SEi,j (a) (i\u2032 6= j); and those of the form SEi,i\u2032 (a). Structure of the latter\n\n\fSUPERIGIDITY INTO MCG\n\n15\n\nin terms of commutators is much more complicated than that of the former. Indeed,\nlet m \u2265 2 and suppose A is finitely generated and {s1 , . . . , sk } is a finite generating\nset for A (as a ring). Then the following finite set is a generating set for Ep2m (A):\nS := {SEi,j (\u00b1sl ) : 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 2m, i 6= j, i\u2032 6= j; 0 \u2264 l \u2264 k}\n\n\u222a {SEi,i\u2032 (\u00b1s\u01eb11 s\u01eb22 * * * s\u01ebkk ) : 1 \u2264 i \u2264 2m; \u01eb1 , . . . , \u01ebk \u2208 {0, 1}}.\n\nHere we regard s0 = 1 and s0l = 1.\nNote that if m \u2265 m0 , then there is a natural inclusion Ep2m0 (A) \u0592\u2192 Ep2m (A),\nwhich sends to the left upper corner.\n4.2. Another realization. The realization in the previous subsection is natural,\nbut it is not suited for study of property (T). For this purpose, in this paper we use\nthe following realization, which may look awkward on other point of view: set the\nfollowing alternating matrix (, which is conjugate to Lm ):\n\u0012\n\u0013\n0\nIm\nJm :=\n\u2208 M2m\n\u2212Im 0\nDefinition 4.2. Let m \u2265 1 and A be a commutative ring.\n(i) The symplectic group over A of degree 2m, written as Sp2m (A), is defined as the\nmultiplicative group of symplectic matrices in matrix ring M2m (A) associated\nwith the alternating matrix Jm , namely,\nSp2m (A) := {g \u2208 M2m (A) : t gJm g = Jm }.\n(ii) Matrices of the following form are called elementary symplectic matrices:\n(1) For 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 m with i 6= j and a \u2208 A, define\nBi,j (a) : = I2m + a(ei,m+j + ej,m+i ),\nCi,j (a) : = I2m + a(em+j,i + em+i,j )(= t Bi,j (a)),\nDi,j (a) : = I2m + aei,j \u2212 aem+j,m+i .\n(2) For 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m and a \u2208 A, define\n\nBi,i (a) := I2m + aei,m+i , Ci,i (a) := I2m + aem+i,i (= t Bi,i (a)).\n\nNamely, for i 6= j,\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\nIm a(ei,j + ej,i )\nIm\n0\nBi,j (a) :=\n, Ci,j (a) :=\n,\n0\nIm\na(ei,j + ej,i ) Im\n\u0012\n\u0013\nIm + aei,j\n0\nDi,j (a) :=\n;\n0\nIm \u2212 aej,i\nand for i = j,\nBi,i (a) :=\n\n\u0012\n\nIm aei,i\n0 Im\n\n\u0013\n\n, Ci,i (a) :=\n\n\u0012\n\nIm 0\naei,i Im\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(iii) The elementary symplectic group Ep2m (A) over A of degree 2m is the subgroup\nof Sp2m (A) generated by all elementary symplectic matrices in the sense above.\n\n\f16\n\nMASATO MIMURA\n\nNote that in item (ii) above, the case of i 6= j corresponds to that of SEl,k (a)\n(l 6= k); and the case of i = j corresponds to that of SEl,l\u2032 (a) in the previous\nsubsection. The indices are however permuted.\nThe following is mere interpretation of an observation in the previous subsection\nto this realization:\n\u2032\n\nLemma 4.3. Let m \u2265 2 and suppose A is finitely generated and {s1 , . . . , sk } is a\nfinite generating set for A (as a ring). Then the following finite set is a generating\nset for Ep2m (A):\nS := {Bi,j (\u00b1sl ), Ci,j (\u00b1sl ), Di,j (\u00b1sl ) : 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 m, i 6= j; 0 \u2264 l \u2264 k}\n\n\u222a {Bi,i (\u00b1s\u01eb11 s\u01eb22 * * * s\u01ebkk ), Ci,i (\u00b1s\u01eb11 s\u01eb22 * * * s\u01ebkk ) : 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m; \u01eb1 , . . . , \u01ebk \u2208 {0, 1}}.\n\nHere we regard s0 = 1 and s0l = 1.\nHere we state the stability theorem of Grunewald\u2013Mennicke\u2013Vaserstein for symplectic case.\nTheorem 4.4. ([GMV]) Let k \u2208 N and A = Z[x1 , . . . , xk ]. Then for any m \u2265 2,\nEp2m (A) = Sp2m (A).\nDefinition 4.5. Let m \u2265 2. Take any k \u2208 N. A symplectic universal lattice of\ndegree 2m denotes a group Sp2m (Z[x1 , . . . , xk ])(= Ep2m (Z[x1 , . . . , xk ])).\nFinally, we define the following identification for certain subgroups of Sp2m (A) (or\nEp2m (A)):\nDefinition 4.6. Let A be a commutative ring.\n(i) For m \u2265 m0 \u2265 2, by SLm0 (A) 6 Sp2m (A) (or, SLm0 (A) \u0592\u2192 Sp2m (A)) we mean\nthe inclusion is realized in the following way:\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f1\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nW\n0\n0\n0\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8fd\n\uf8f2\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n0\nI\n0\n0\nm\u2212m\n0\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n: W \u2208 SLm0 (A) 6 Sp2m (A).\nt\n\uf8ed 0\n0\nW \u22121\n0 \uf8f8\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8fe\n\uf8f3\n0\n0\n0\nI\nm\u2212m0\n\n(ii) Let m \u2265 2. We denote by S m\u2217 (Am ) the additive group of all symmetric\nmatrices in Mm (A). By Em (A)\u22c9S m\u2217 (Am )D S m\u2217 (Am ), we identify these groups\nrespectively with\n\u001a\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u001b\nW\nv\nm\u2217\nm\n(W, v) :=\n: W \u2208 Em (A), v \u2208 S (A )\n0 t (W \u22121 )\n\u0013\n\u001b\n\u001a\u0012\nIm v\nm\u2217\nm\n: v \u2208 S (A ) .\nD\n0 Im\nThus the action of Em (A) on S m\u2217 (Am ) is:\n(W, 0)(Im , v)(W \u22121, 0) = (Im , W v tW ) (W \u2208 Em (A), v \u2208 S m\u2217 (Am )).\nHere Em (A) denotes the elementary group over A.\n\n\fSUPERIGIDITY INTO MCG\n\n17\n\n(iii) Let m \u2265 m0 \u2265 2.

This pair plays a central role in the\nstudy of property (T), see the next subsection.\n4.3. Known results on property (T). The first step to (T) for symplectic universal lattices has benn done by M. Neuhauser:\n\nTheorem 4.7. (Neuhauser, [Neu, Theorem 3.3]) Let A = Z[x1 , . . . , xk ] for any\ninteger k \u2208 Z. Then for m \u2265 2, the pair Em (A) \u22c9 S m\u2217 (Am )D S m\u2217 (Am ), which is\ndefined as in item (ii) of Definition 4.6, has relative (T).\nDespite this theorem, it seemed challenging to extend from this relative property\n(and resulting relative (T) for the pair Sp2m (A)> S m\u2217 (Am )) to the full property (T).\nFor some difficulty, see Remark 4.9 in below. Nevertheless, in 2011, Ershov\u2013JaikinZapirain\u2013Kassabov suceeded in establishing (T) with substantially generalizing results.\nTheorem 4.8. (Ershov\u2013Jaikin-Zapirain\u2013Kassabov [EJK]) Let \u03a6 be a reduced irreducible classical root system of rank at least 2 and A be a finitely generated commutative ring. Then St\u03a6 (A), the twisted Steinberg group over A, has property (T).\nIn particular, every symplectic universal lattice Sp2m (Z[x1 , . . . , xk ]) (m \u2265 2) has\nproperty (T).\nNote that there is a surjection from St\u03a6 (A) onto Ep2m (A) for \u03a6 being the root\nsystem of type Cm , and that thus the latter statement is a part of the former\nassertion, which treats notably wide cases. For details of twisted Steinberg group,\nsee [EJK].\nRemark 4.9. A notion of bounded generation is a powerful tool to establish (T)\n[Sha1]. Recall that for a group G, and subsets (Sj )i\u2208J of G indexed by J with e \u2208 Sj ,\nwe say (Sj )i\u2208J boundedly generates G if there exists N \u2208 N such that\n\u0010 [ \u0011N\nG=\nSj\nj\u2208J\n\nholds. Namely, if there exists\nS N \u2208 N such that any element in G can be written as\nproduct of N elements of j\u2208J Sj . We warn that in some other literature, bounded\ngeneration is used for a confined situation as follows: J is a finite set, and each Sj\nis a cyclic subgroup of G.\nIn [Vas], L. Vaserstein has proven the following remarkable bounded generations\nfor universal lattices and symplectic universal lattices:\nTheorem 4.10. (Vaserstein [Vas]) Let Ak = Z[x1 , . . . lk ] for any k. Then for any\nm \u2265 3, SLm (Ak ) is boundedly generated by the set of elementary matrices and the\nsubgroup SL2 (Ak ), which sits in the left upper corner.\n\n\f18\n\nMASATO MIMURA\n\nFurthermore, for any m \u2265 2, Sp2m (Ak ) is boundedly generated by the set of elementary symplectic matrices and the subgroup Sp2 (Ak ).\nHere Sp2m (Ak ) is realized as in Definition 4.2, and Sp2 (Ak ) is realized in Sp2m (Ak )\nas in item (iii) of Definition 4.6, namely,\n\uf8f1\uf8eb\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f6\na\n0\nb\n0\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\uf8f2\uf8ec\n\uf8fd\n\uf8f7\n0\nI\n0\n0\na\nb\nm\u22121\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\nSp2 (Ak ) := \uf8ed\n:\n\u2208\nSp\n(A\n)\n6 Sp2m (Ak ).\nk\n2\nc d\nc\n0\nd\n0 \uf8f8\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\uf8fe\n0\n0\n0 Im\u22121\n\nThe following deep theorem, Shalom's machinery, [Sha3] enables us to establish\n(T) for universal lattices from some relative (T) and Vaserstein's bounded generation\nabove:\nTheorem 4.11. (Shalom's machinery, [Sha3]) Suppose a quadraple (G, H, N1 , N2 ),\nwhere G is a finitely generated group with finite abelianization; and H, N1 , N2 are\nsubgroups in G, satisfies the following four conditions:\n(i)\n(ii)\n(iii)\n(iv)\n\nThe group G is generated by N1 and N2 together;\nThe subgroup H normalizes N1 and N2 ;\nThe group G is boundedly generated by H, N1 , and N2 .\nFor both i \u2208 {1, 2}, Ni 6 G has relative (T);\n\nThen G has property (T).\n\nIndeed, for universal lattice G = SLm (A) (A = Z[x1 , . . . , xk ], m \u2265 3, set\n\u0013\u001b\n\u0013\u001b\n\u001a\u0012\n\u001a\u0012\nIm\u22121 \u2217\n\u2217 0\n\u223c\n\u223c\nH=\n= SLm\u22121 (A), N1 =\n= Am\u22121 , N2 = t N1 =\u223c\n= Am\u22121 .\n0 1\n0\n1\nThen conditions (i) and (ii) are trivial, and condition (iv) follows from a wellknown result [Sha1]. Condition (iii) is highly non-trivial, but Theorem 4.10 assures\nit. There is a generalization of Shalom's machinery for general Banach space case\n(other than the Hilbert space case), see Section 7 and [Mim1] for details.\nNow we explain why Shalom's machinery does not work for symplectic universal\nlattices. Consider for instance the case of G = Sp4 (A) (A = Z[x1 , . . . xk ]). Then in\nthe view of Theorem 4.7, the following triple (H, N1 , N2 ) is a standard candidate for\npairs with the Shalom's machinery:\n\u001a\u0012\n\u0013\n\u001b\nW\n0\nH = SL2 (A) :=\n: W \u2208 SL2 (A) ,\n0 t W \u22121\n\u0013\n\u001b\n\u001a\u0012\nI2 v\n2\u2217\n2\n: v \u2208 S (A ) \u223c\nN1 :=\n= S 2\u2217 (A2 ).\n= S 2\u2217 (A2 ), N2 := t N1 \u223c\n0 I2\nThe point here is the following: even though the group Sp2 (A) and SL2 (A) are\nisomorphic as abstract groups, their realization inside Sp2m (A) are completely different. A group relating to Vaserstein's bounded generation is Sp2 (A); but a group\nrelating to relative (T) is SL2 (A).\nTherefore to prove of property (T) for symplectic universal lattices, one likely\nneeds the different technologies in the work in [EJK].\n\n\fSUPERIGIDITY INTO MCG\n\n19\n\n5. Proof of (TT)/T for smplectic universal lattices\n5.1. Key observation. The following is a key to proving Theorem 1.4. Although\nthis looks similar to Shalom's machinery (Theorem 4.11), the proof of it is extremely\nless involved.\nTheorem 5.1. Suppose a triple (G, H, U), where G is a countable group; H 6 G is\na subgroup; and U \u2286 G is a subset satisfies the following five conditions:\n(i) The set U generates G;\n(ii) The set U is invariant under the conjugation of elements in H. Namely, for\nany h \u2208 H, hUh\u22121 \u2286 U;\n(iii) The group G is boundedly generated by P and H (recall the definition from\nRemark 4.9);\n(iv) The pair G \u2287 U has relative (TT);\n(v) The group G has (T).\nThen G has property (TT)/T.\nProof. Let \u03c0 be a unitary G-representation with \u03c0 6\u2287 1G , and b be a quasi-\u03c0-cocycle.\nBy the definition of quasi-cocycles and condition (iv), one can set finite numbers\nC1 := sup kb(g1 g2 ) \u2212 b(g1 ) \u2212 \u03c1(g1 )b(g2 )k, C2 := sup kb(u)k.\ng1 ,g2 \u2208G\n\nu\u2208U\n\nSet C = max{C1 , C2 } < \u221e.\nWe will show b(H) is bounded. Take any h \u2208 H and any u \u2208 U. Then we have\nthe following inequalities:\nk\u03c0(u)b(h) \u2212 b(h)k \u2264 kb(uh) \u2212 b(u) \u2212 b(h)k + C\n\n\u2264kb(uh) \u2212 b(h)k + 2C = kb(h(h\u22121 uh)) \u2212 b(h)k + 2C\n\n\u2264kb(h) + \u03c0(h)b(h\u22121 uh) \u2212 b(h)k + 3C\n\u2264kb(h\u22121 uh)k + 3C \u2264 4C.\n\nHere in the last line we use condition (ii) and condition (iv). Note that the last\ndominating term 4C is independent of the choices of h \u2208 H and u \u2208 U.\nNow suppose b(H) is not bounded. Then by the inequalities above, this means\nfor any \u01eb > 0, \u03c0 admits a unit vector \u03be which satisfies\nsup k\u03c0(u)\u03be \u2212 \u03bek < \u01eb.\nu\u2208U\n\nSince U is a generating set for G (condition (i)), this means that \u03c0 \u0017 1G . However\nthis contradicts property (T) for G (condition (v)). Therefore b(H) is bounded, as\nclaimed.\nFinally, we obtain that b(G) is bounded by employing bounded generation (condition (iii)).\n\u0003\nThe reason why the proof of this theorem is simple is that the assumption requires\nproperty (T) for the whole group, which itself is a big issue to check. Nevertheless,\nTheorem 5.1 can apply to remarkable cases, as we will see in the next subsection.\nFurthermore, Theorem 5.1 becomes more interesting if we consider analogues of\n(T) and (FH) in Banach space setting (recall from Subsection 2.2 that (TT) is a\nstrengthening of (FH), and not of (T)). We refer to Section 7 for details.\n\n\f20\n\nMASATO MIMURA\n\n5.2. Proof of Theorem 1.4. We need examples of triples (G, H, U) for which\nTheorem 5.1 applies. The following theorem due to N. Ozawa [Oza] provides us\nwith various of examples of group pairs with relative property (TT), which relates\nto condition (iv):\nTheorem 5.2. (Ozawa [Oza, Proposition 3]) Let G = G0 \u22c9 A be the semidirect\nproduct of a abelian group by a continuous action of G0 (G0 and A are locally\ncompact second countable groups). Then the following are equivalent:\n(i) The pair G > A has relative (T).\n(ii) The pair G > A has relative (TT).\nIn fact, he has shown that under the condition above, relative (T) for G > A is\nequivalent to \"relative property (TTT)\" for G > A, which looks much stronger than\nrelative property (TT). See [Oza] for details.\nThanks to Ozawa's theorem above, we have the following remarkable examples of\nTheorem 5.1:\nTheorem 5.3. Let A = Z[x1 , . . . , xk ]. Then the following triples (G, H, U) satisfy\nthe conditions in Theorem 5.1:\nS\n(1) G = SLm (A) with m \u2265 3; H = G; and U = g\u2208G gEg \u22121.\nS\n(2) G = Sp2m (A) with m \u2265 2; H = G; and U = g\u2208G gSg \u22121 .\n\nHere E \u2286 SLm (A) is the set of all elementary matrices, and S \u2286 Sp2m (A) is the set\nof all elementary symplectic matrices.\nTheorem 5.3 together with Theorem 5.1 immediately implies Theorem 1.4.\nProof. (Theorem 5.3) First observe that we only need to confirm condition (iv)\n(relative (TT)). Indeed, conditions (i) and (ii) are trivially satisfied; condition (iii)\nalso immediately follows (because H itself is G!); and condition (v) follows from\na deep result of Shalom\u2013Vaserstein (for universal lattices, see Remark 4.9), and of\nErshov\u2013Jaikin-Zapirain\u2013Kassabov, Theorem 4.8 (for symplectic universal lattices).\nAlso note that the pair G \u2287 S for item (2) has relative (TT). This follows from\nan easy fact that Sp2m (A) contains many copy of Em (A) \u22c9 S m\u2217 (Am )D S m\u2217 (Am ),\ntogether with Theorem 4.7 and Theorem 5.2. For a similar reason, the pair G \u2287 E\nfor item (1) also has relative (TT).\nTherefore to prove Theorem 5.3, it suffices to check that the pair (H, U0 ) has the\nfollowing property, here U0 = E for item (1) and U0 = S for item (2):\n\uf8f1\nthere exists a global bound N \u2208 N\n\uf8f2\nsuch that for any g \u2208 H and for any s \u2208 U0 ,\n(\u2217) :\n\uf8f3\ngsg \u22121 can be writen as a product of at most N elements of U0 .\n\nFor both cases of (1) and (2), it is non-trivial to verify (\u2217). However, by clever\nmatrix computation, it has been verified (implicitly) respectively by Park and Woodburn for (1); and by V. I. Kopeiko for (2):\nTheorem 5.4. ([PaWo]; [Kop])\n(1) (Park\u2013Woodburn) The pair (H, U0 ) = (SLm (A), E), m \u2265 3, satisfies (\u2217).\n(2) (Kopeiko) The pair (H, U0 ) = (Sp2m (A), S), m \u2265 2, satisfies (\u2217).\n\n\fSUPERIGIDITY INTO MCG\n\n21\n\nHere we just sketch the proof of item (1) of Park\u2013Woodburn. Take s = Ei,j (a) \u2208\nS. Then for g \u2208 H,\ngsg \u22121 = Im + (i-th column vector of g) * a * (j-th column vector of g \u22121 ).\n\nLet v = t (v1 , . . . , vm ) be the i-th column vector of g, w = (w1 , . . . , wm ) be a times\nthe j-th\nvector of g \u22121P\n, and (g1 , . . . , gm ) be the i-th row vector of g \u22121 . Then since\nProw\nm\nm\ni 6= j, l=1\nP gl vl = 1 and l=1 wl vl = 0. Therefore by letting bl,n = wl gn \u2212 wn gl , one\nhas w = l<n bl,n (vn el \u2212 vl en ), and thus (the following are due to Suslin),\n\u0010X\n\u0011\n\u22121\ngsg = Im + v * w = Im + v *\nbln (vn el \u2212 vl en )\n=Im +\n\nX\nl<n\n\nl<n\n\nY\n(Im + v * bl,n (vn el \u2212 vl en )).\nv * bl,n (vn el \u2212 vl en ) =\nl<n\n\nMennicke has shown that each factor in the very below side of the equalities above\ncan be written as a product of bounded numbers of (only depend on m and does not\ndepend on g and s), precisely at most 8 + 2(m \u2212 2) = 2m + 4, elementary matrices.\nTherefore, for any g \u2208 H and s \u2208 U0 gsg \u22121 is a product of at most (m + 2)m(m \u2212 1)\nelements in U0 , and this bound is independent of the choices of g and s. For details,\nconsult Lemma 2.3, Lemma 2.6, and Corollary 2.7 in [PaWo].\nThe proof of item (2) of Theorem 5.4 is much more complicated, but it is still\ndone by direct matrix computation. See \u00a71 of the paper [Kop] of Kopeiko.\nNow Theorem 5.4 and thus condition (iii) in Theorem 5.1 has been verified in\nboth cases. This ends our proof.\n\u0003\nRemark 5.5. If one looks at the proof above carefully, one may notice that property\n(\u2217) has potential for avioding a deep result of bounded generation (condition (iii)\nin Theorem 5.1). Instead, one needs to show another \"bounded generation\" (\u2217) to\ncheck condition (iv). However as we have seen in above, a proof of (\u2217) may be done\nby some elementary (but clever) computation, without deep tools.\nIn view of this, it is natural to ask the following questions:\nQuestion 5.6. (a) Is property (\u2217) is satisfied for the pair (H, U0 ) = (Em (R), E),\nm \u2265 3? Here R is the noncommutative polynomial ring Zhx1 , . . . , xk i and E is\nthe set of all elementary matrices.\n(b) For a reduced irreducible classical root system \u03a6 and a commutative unital ring\nA, one can construct the elementary Chevalley group E\u03a6 (A) as the multiplicative\ngroup generated by the root subgroups with respect to the standard torus. Let E\nbe the set of all elementary matrices with respect to \u03a6. The question is the\nfollowing: for \u03a6 of rank \u2265 2, does the pair (H, U0 ) = (E\u03a6 (A), E) satisfy (\u2217)?\n\nNote that property (T) for the groups above has been shown, respectively by\nErshov\u2013Jaikin-Zapirain [ErJa] for (a); and by Ershov\u2013Jaikin-Zapirain\u2013Kassabov\n[EJK] for (b). Therefore positive answers will imply property (TT)/T and thus\nalso homomorphism superridigity into MCG(\u03a3) and into Out(Fn ). Moreover, at\nleast in case (a), positive answer to Question 5.6 will imply property (FFLp )/T (and\nin particular (FLp )) for noncommutative universal lattices with m \u2265 4. For details\nof this, see Section 7.\nThere is a work of G. Taddei which shows the normality of E\u03a6 (A) in the Chevalley\ngroup. However this proof does not verify the existence of such a global bound in\n\n\f22\n\nMASATO MIMURA\n\n(\u2217). For noncommutative ring, the argument in [PaWo] does not work. Finally we\nnote that bounded generation of the whole group, instead of checking just (\u2217), seems\nto be an extremely challenging problem.\nRemark 5.7. If one appeals to Vaserestin's bounded generation (Theorem 4.10),\nthen one can get triples (G, H, U) in Theorem 5.1 with small H. For instance, for\nA = Z[x1 , . . . , xk ], the following triples work:\n\u2022 G =S\nSLm (A) with m \u2265 3; H = SL2 (A) in the left upper corner of G; and\nU = h\u2208H hEh\u22121 .\n\u2022 G = Sp2m (A) with m \u2265S 2; H = Sp2 (A) realized in G as in item (iii) of\nDefinition 4.6; and U = h\u2208H hSh\u22121 .\nIn these cases, it is easy to check (\u2217).\nRemark 5.8. As in Section 2, it is not known whether universal lattices have\n(TT). However by a matrix computation is [PaWo] and a previous result of the\nauthor [Mim2], we have at least the following:\nProposition 5.9. Let A = Z[x1 , . . . , xk ] with k \u2208 N. Suppose m \u2265 6. Then\nSLm (A) > U2 (A) has relative property (TT). Here U2 (A) denotes the multiplicative\ngroup of unipotent matrices in M2 (A), which sits in the left upper corner of SLm (A).\nProof. Thanks to (TT)/T, we only need to verify boundedness of quasi-cocycles into\ntrivial representation, which is called a quasi-homomorphisms [Cal]. It is easy to\nsee that such a quasi-cocycle is bounded on the set of elementary matrices (because\nevery elementary matrices in SLm (A) is conjugate to its inverse). We use the fact\nthat the ring A is a unique factorization domain. Therefore any 2 \u00d7 2 unipotent\nmatrix s is of the following form:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 + auv \u2212au2\ns=\n.\nav 2\n1 \u2212 auv\nHere a, u, v \u2208 A. P. 281 of [PaWo] (Mennicke) states this matrix is a product of 8\nelementary matrices in E3 (A)(= SL3 (A)). Finally, we appeal to the following result\n(recall that a quasi-homomorphism is said to be homogeneous if it is a homomorphism on every cyclic subgroups):\n\nTheorem 5.10. (Compare with [Mim2, Claim, p. 3524]) Let R be a (possibly\nnoncommutative) associative unital ring. Suppose g \u2208 E2 (R) and s \u2208 E2 (R) satisfy\nthe following conditions:\n(i) The matrix g + g \u22121 \u2208 M2 (R) commutes with s.\n(ii) The equality (s \u2212 I2 )2 = 0 holds.\nThen for any homogeneous quasi-homomorphism \u03c6 on E6 (R), we have\n\u03c6(gs) = \u03c6(sg) = \u03c6(g) + \u03c6(s).\nHere we put E2 (R) in the left upper corner of E6 (R), and view g, s \u2208 E2 (R) as\nelements in E6 (R) with this identification.\nThis theorem can be shown in the same argument as in [Mim2]. Since for any g \u2208\nE2 (R), g + g \u22121 is in the center of M2 (R) provided R is commutative, Theorem 5.10\nshows that every quasi-homomorphism on SLm (A) is bounded on U2 (A). This ends\nour proof (usually the terminology \"quasi-homomorphism\" is used for the case of\n\n\fSUPERIGIDITY INTO MCG\n\n23\n\n(\u03c0, H) = (1G , R). However Theorem 5.10 holds for any quasi-cocycle into trivial\nrepresentation on any Banach space).\n\u0003\nWe warn the following: in view of Theorem 4.10, it may seem that Proposition 5.9\nwould imply (TT) for universal lattices of degree \u2265 6. However, there is a gap, which\nlies in the fact that U2 (Z[x]) is a quite small subgroup in SL2 (Z[x]). See [KrMc] for\nprecise meaning of this.\n6. Measure equivalence and induction of quasi-cocycles\n6.1. Definition and ME-cocycles. We shortly recall definition of the measure\nequivalence and related concepts. For comprehensive treatments, we refer the readers to surveys of A. Furman [Fur2] and of Shalom [Sha4].\nDefinition 6.1. (i) Two countable (infinite discrete) group \u0393, \u039b are measure equivalent (or shortly ME ) if there exists an infinite measure space (\u03a9, m) with a\nmeasurable, measure preserving action of \u0393 \u00d7 \u039b such that the action of each\nof the groups \u0393, \u039b admit finite measure fundamental domains:\nG\nG\n\u03a9=\n\u03b3Y =\n\u03bbX.\n\u03b3\u2208\u0393\n\n\u03bb\u2208\u039b\n\nThe space (\u03a9, m) is called a (\u0393, \u039b)-coupling or an ME-coupling.\n(ii) Suppose (\u03a9, m) be an ME-coupling of two groups \u0393 and \u039b and let Y, X be\nfundamental domains for \u0393, \u039b actions respectively. The retraction associated\nwith X is the measurable \u039b-equivariant map \u03ba : \u03a9 \u2192 \u039b defined as follows: for\n\u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9, \u03ba(\u03c9)\u22121\u03c9 \u2208 X. From this, we obtain a map \u03b1 : \u0393 \u00d7 X \u2192 \u039b defined by\n\u03b1(\u03b3, x) = \u03ba(\u03b3x)\u22121 for \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393, x \u2208 X. Similarly, one can define the retraction\nassociated with Y and a map \u03b2 : \u039b \u00d7 Y \u2192 \u0393. These maps \u03b1, \u03b2 are called\nME-cocycles.\nA motivating example is that \u0393 and \u039b are lattices in the same locally compact\ngroup G. Then G with a Haar measure gives an ME-coupling (recall that existence\nof a lattice implies G is unimodular), and a corresponding \u0393 \u00d7 \u039b action is the left\nmultiplication of \u0393 and the right inverse multiplication of \u039b on G.\nWe have a natural \u0393-action on X, and denote by \u03b3 *x (\u03b3 \u2208 \u0393, x \u2208 X) to distinguish\nit from the \u0393-action on \u03a9. In this setting, the ME-cocycle \u03b1 : \u0393 \u00d7 X \u2192 \u039b satisfies\nthe following:\nfor any \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393 and x \u2208 X, \u03b3 * x = \u03b1(\u03b3, x)\u03b3x.\nTherefore this \u03b1 is a Borel cocycle, namely, a Borel measurable map satisfying the\ncocycle identity:\nfor any \u03b31 , \u03b32 \u2208 \u0393 and x \u2208 X, \u03b1(\u03b32 \u03b31 , x) = \u03b1(\u03b32, \u03b31 * x)\u03b1(\u03b31 , x).\n\nNote that ME is indeed an equivalence relation, see [Fur2] for the proof. Also, for\nany ME coupling, one can replace it with ergodic one, see Lemma 2.2 of [Fur1].\n6.2. Induction process. One good feature of ME is that one can induce unitary\nrepresentation and bounded cohomology. Also, induction of (quasi-)cocycles is available if some integrability condition (recall the statement in Theorem B) is fulfilled.\nHere we only treat L2 -induction of a Hilbert (unitary) \u0393-module, which fits our\n\n\f24\n\nMASATO MIMURA\n\npurpose. For our use in below, we will consider \u0393-induction of \u039b-module, for an\nME-coupling (\u03a9, m) of \u0393, \u039b.\nLet (\u03c3, H) be a unitary \u039b-representation. First, we define the induced \u0393-module\n(\u03a9I\u0393\u039b \u03c3, \u03a9\u0393\u039b H) by\n\u03a9\u0393\u039b H = L[2] (\u03a9, H)\u039b\n= {f : \u03a9 \u2192 H with f (\u03bb\u03c9) = \u03c3(\u03bb)f (\u03c9) and\n\nkf k22\n\n=\n\nZ\n\nX\n\nkf (x)k2 dm(x) < \u221e},\n\nwhere X \u223c\n= \u03a9/\u039b is a \u039b-fundamental domain and the \u0393-representation is given by\ntranslation. Equivalently, \u03a9\u0393\u039b H \u223c\n= L2 (X, H) with the twisted \u0393-action defined a.e.\nby\n((\u03a9I\u0393\u039b \u03c3)(\u03b3)f )(x) = \u03c3(\u03b1(\u03b3 \u22121 , x)\u22121 )f (\u03b3 \u22121 * x)\nfor the associated ME-cocycle \u03b1 : \u0393 \u00d7 X \u2192 \u039b. Then \u03a9I\u0393\u039b \u03c3 becomes a unitary \u0393representation.\nSecondly, we see induction of the bounded cohomology. Fix a \u039b-fundamental\ndomain X and a retract \u03ba : \u03a9 \u2192 \u039b. For f \u2208 l2 (\u039bn+1 ; H)\u039b , define\n\u03a9i\u0393\u039b f (\u03b30, . . . , \u03b3n )(\u03c9) := f (\u03ba(\u03b30\u22121 \u03c9), . . . , \u03ba(\u03b3n\u22121 \u03c9)) \u2208 l\u221e (\u0393n+1 ; L[2] (\u03a9, H)\u039b )\u0393 .\n\nThe point here is that \u03a9i\u0393\u039b f is 2-integrable because we treat bounded cocycles (this\nis why the induction process for bounded cohomology behaves goodly).\nThis map induces the well-defined morphism\n\u03a9i\u0393\u039b : Hbn (\u039b; \u03c3) \u2192 Hbn (\u0393; \u03a9I\u0393\u039b \u03c3).\n\nFinally, we explain induction of (quasi-)cocycles. Let b : \u039b \u2192 H be a quasi-\u03c3cocycle. Then by the identification \u03a9\u0393\u039b H \u223c\n= L2 (X, H), we hope to define the induced\n\u03a9I\u0393\u039b \u03c3-cocyle b\u0303 by the following formula:\nfor \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393 and x \u2208 X, b\u0303(\u03b3)(x) := b(\u03b1(\u03b3 \u22121 , x)\u22121 ).\n\nHowever, this is not necessarily 2-summable (, namely, possibly b\u0303 does not range in\nL2 (X, H)). One condition, called the L2 -condition, assures that the induction above\nis well-defined:\nLemma 6.2. Stick to the setting in this subsection. Suppose \u039b is finitely generated\nand there exists a \u039b-fundamental domain X such that the associated ME cocycle\n\u03b1 : \u0393 \u00d7 X \u2192 \u039b satisfies the L2 -condition:\nfor any \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393, |\u03b1(\u03b3, *)|\u039b \u2208 L2 (X).\n\nHere | * |\u039b is a word metric on \u039b with respect to a finite generating set of \u039b. Then for\nany unitary \u039b-representation (\u03c3, H) and any quasi-\u03c3-cocycle b, the (L2 -)induction b\u0303\nbecomes a quasi-\u03a9I\u0393\u039b \u03c3-cocycle \u0393 \u2192 L2 (X, H).\nIn particular, the induction map of bounded cohomology\n\u03a9i\u0393\u039b : Hbn (\u039b; \u03c3) \u2192 Hbn (\u0393; \u03a9I\u0393\u039b \u03c3),\ng\ng\nassociated with this fundamental domain X maps QH(\u039b;\n\u03c3) inside QH(\u0393;\n\u03a9I\u0393\u039b \u03c3).\n\nThis lemma follows from the fact that the growth of a quasi-cocycle can be dominated linearly by a word length of a group (note that if \u039b is finitely generated, the\nchoice of finite generating sets does not affect the growth of the associated word\nlength), and from Lemma 2.10.\n\n\fSUPERIGIDITY INTO MCG\n\n25\n\nRemark 6.3. Some cases this L2 -condition is known to be held. A trivial case is\nthat \u0393 and \u039b are lattices in the same group, and that \u0393 is cocompact. In this case,\nan ME-cocycle \u03b1 (for an appropriate \u039b-fundamental domain) satisfies L\u221e -condition,\nwhich is stronger than L2 -condition.\nA quite non-trivial case is that \u039b (or \u0393) is a lattice in a simple higher rank\nalgebraic group. In this case, an argument in Shalom's paper [Sha2], which is based\non a study of word lengths on higher rank lattice by Lubotzky\u2013Mozes\u2013Raghunathan\n[LMR], together with Furman's superrigidity [Fur1] insures that there exists a \u039bfundamental domain such that the associated ME-cocycle satisfies Lp -condition for\nall finite p.\nFor the proof of Theorem B, certain properties concerning induction are needed.\nFirst, we need the conception of weak mixing property for a unitary representation,\nsee [Fur1] for details. We just recall the definition that a unitary representation is\nsaid to be weakly mixing if it does not contain finite dimensional subrepresentations.\nAn example of weakly mixing representation is the left regular representation of an\ninfinite countable group (because matrix coefficients are C0 in this case, in other\nwords, it is strongly mixing). We also note that weak mixing property is stable\nunder pull-backs and inductions from finite index subgroups.\nLemma 6.4. (Furman [Fur1, Lemma 8.2]) Let (\u03a9, m) be an ergodic ME-coupling of\n\u0393 and \u039b and let \u03c3 be a weakly mixing unitary \u039b-representation. Then the induced\n\u0393-representation \u03a9I\u0393\u039b \u03c3 does not contain 1\u0393 .\nFinally, we state a notable result of Monod\u2013Shalom which concerns induction of\nbounded cohomology (they in fact prove for any separable coefficient module):\nTheorem 6.5. (Monod\u2013Shalom [MoSh, Theorem 4.4]) Let (\u03a9, m) be an ME-coupling\nof \u0393, \u039b. Then the induction map in degree 2\n\u03a9i\u0393\u039b : Hb2 (\u039b; \u03c3) \u2192 Hb2 (\u0393; \u03a9I\u0393\u039b \u03c3),\n\nis injective for any Hilbert (unitary) \u039b-module. Moreover, it does not depend on the\nchoice of a retraction \u03ba.\n6.3. Proof of Theorem B.\nProof. First, we observe that in the proof Theorem 1.3, the following two properties\nare sufficient to deduce homomorphism superrigidity from a countable group \u039b into\nMCG(\u03a3) and into Out(Fn ):\ng\n(a) For any weakly mixing unitary \u039b representation \u03c3, QH(\u039b,\n\u03c3) = 0;\n(b) For any finite index subgroup \u039b0 \u2264 \u039b, \u039b0 has finite abelianization (for instance,\n\u039b has property (T)).\nFor weakly mixing representation, see the previous subsection.\nIn the setting of Theorem B, we will check that \u039b satisfies these two properties.\nItem (b) follows from the fact that (T) is an ME-invariant [Fur2]. For item (a),\ntake any weakly mixing \u039b-representation \u03c3. Consider the L2 -induction of this representation and corresponding bounded cohomology. Theorem 6.5, Lemma 6.2, and\nexistence of a \u039b-fundamental domain with respect to which the ME-cocycle is L2\nimply that the induction map in degree 2\n\u03a9i\u0393\u039b : Hb2 (\u039b; \u03c3) \u2192 Hb2 (\u0393; \u03a9I\u0393\u039b \u03c3)\n\n\f26\n\nMASATO MIMURA\n\ng\ng\nis injective and that it maps QH(\u039b;\n\u03c3) into QH(\u0393;\n\u03a9I\u0393\u039b \u03c3) as an injection. By\n\u0393\nLemma 6.4, \u03a9I\u039b \u03c3 6\u2287 1\u0393 . Hence thanks to property (TT)/T for \u0393 (Theorem 1.4),\ng\nQH(\u0393;\n\u03a9I\u0393\u039b \u03c3) = 0. We thus have\nand this confirms (a) in above.\n\ng\nQH(\u039b;\n\u03c3) = 0\n\n\u0003\n\nRemark 6.6. Furman has pointed out to the author the following: his work in\nprogress with U. Bader and R. Sauer [BFS] implies that at least for a universal\nlattice or a symplectic universal lattice itself, if a locally compact second countable\ngroup G contains it as a lattice, then up to finite noise and compact kernel, G must\nbe totally disconnected. It might be interesting if there exists a nontrivial \u039b in\nTheorem B (for A which is not a ring of integers of a certain field). However at the\nmoment, the author has no such examples.\nRemark 6.7. It does not seem to be known whether the L2 -condition in Theorem B\ncan be removed. One possible way to do this is to show that Hb2 (G; \u03c0) itself vanishes\nfor G a universal lattice or symplectic universal lattices; and \u03c0 6\u2287 1G a unitary\nrepresentation. Compare with Conjecture 1.8 in [Mim1].\nIn fact, by making full use of infinite dimensionality in Theorem 2.11 and Theorem 2.12, we only have to show finite dimensionality of Hb2 (G; \u03c0) above; or H 2 (G; \u03c0)\nin the setting above. The latter follows from the injectivity of the comparison maps,\nwhich is a corollary of (TT)/T.\n7. Property (FFB )/T for Banach spaces\n7.1. Definitions and fundamental facts. A Banach space B is said to be ucus\nif the norm is uniformly convex and uniformly smooth (for these definitions details,\nwe refer to [BFGM]), and is said to be superreflexive if it admits a ucus norm which\nis compatible to the original norm. Superreflexive Baanach spaces are reflexive. A\nbasic example of superreflexive space is Lp -space with p \u2208 (1, \u221e) (it is ucus).\nIn this section, we consider an isometric representation \u03c1 of a group G in a Banach\nspace B. Unlike unitary cases, it is not true in general that the space B \u03c1(G) of \u03c1(G)invariant vectors is complemented in B. However, the following result in [BFGM]\nstates that it is complemented if B is superreflexive:\nProposition 7.1. ([BFGM, Proposition 2.6, Proposition 2.10]) Let G be a group,\nN E G be a normal subgroup. Let \u03c1 be an isometric G-representation on a ucus\nBanach space B. Then there is a decomposition of B as \u03c1(G)-spaces\n\u2032\nB = B \u03c1(N ) \u2295 B\u03c1(N\n).\n\u2020\n\n\u2032\n\u2217 \u03c1 (N )\nHere B\u03c1(N\n, where \u03c1\u2020 denotes the contragredient\n) as the annihilator of (B )\nrepresentation G in B \u2217 , defined as \u03c1\u2020 (g)\u03c6i = h\u03c1(g \u22121)\u03be, \u03c6i (g \u2208 G, \u03c6 \u2208 B \u2217 , \u03be \u2208 B)\n(h*, *i denotes the duality B \u00d7 B \u2217 \u2192 C).\n\u2032\nMoreover, for any \u03be = \u03be0 + \u03be1 where \u03be \u2208 B, \u03be0 \u2208 B \u03c1(N ) and \u03be1 \u2208 B\u03c1(N\n) , k\u03be0 k \u2264 k\u03bek\nand k\u03be1 k \u2264 2k\u03bek hold.\n\nWe note that in [BFGM] (Proposition 2.3), they also show that for a superreflexive\nspace B and an isometric G-representation \u03c1 in B, one can take a \u03c1(G)-invariant\n\n\fSUPERIGIDITY INTO MCG\n\n27\n\nucus norm which is compatible to the original norm. Also note that the normality\nof the subgroup N is needed, otherwise B \u03c1(N ) may not be \u03c1(G)-invariant.\nFor an isometric G-representation \u03c1 in B, the concepts of \u03c1 having almost invariant\nvectors (we also write this as \u03c1 \u0017 1G ); \u03c1-(1-)cocycles, \u03c1-(1-)coboundaries, and group\ncohomology H \u2022 (G; \u03c1); quasi-\u03c1-(1-)cocycles; and bounded cohomology Hb\u2022 (G; \u03c1) are\ndefined in the same manner as in Definition 2.4.\nRecall that property (T) for a group is defined by the condition \"for any unitary\nG-representation, \u03c0 + 1G \u21d2 \u03c0 \u000f 1G .\" However, in general setting, the straight generalization of above does not give information for the case of \u03c0 \u2287 1G . More precisely,\nif we consider unitary representation, then we can restrict our representation on the\northogonal complement of the space of invariant vectors. However even in the case\nof considering isometric representation on Lp spaces, the canonical complement, defined in Proposition 7.1 is a subspace of Lp space, and usually not realizable as an\nLp space on any measure space. Therefore, the following definition is appropriate:\nDefinition 7.2. ([BFGM]) Let B be a Banach space.\n(1) A pair G D N of a group and a normal subgroup is said to have relative\nproperty (TB ) if for any isometric representation \u03c1 of G in B, the isometric\nrepresentation \u03c1\u2032 on the quotient Banach space B/B \u03c1(N ) , naturally induced by\n\u03c1, satisfies \u03c1\u2032 \u000f 1G . By Proposition 7.1, if B is superreflexive, then the definition\nabove is equivalent to the following: for any isometric representation \u03c1 of G in B,\n\u2032\nthe restriction of \u03c1 in B\u03c1(N\n) (see Proposition 7.1) does not have almost invariant\nvectors.\nA group G is said to have property (TB ) if G D G has relative (TB ).\n(2) A group G is said to have property (FB ) if for any isometric G-representation\n\u03c1 in B, every \u03c1-cocycle is a \u03c1-coboundary. Equivalently, if for any such \u03c1,\nH 1 (G; \u03c1, B) = 0 holds.\n(3) ([Mim1]) A pair G \u2287 U is said to have relative property (FFB ) if for any isometric\nG-representation \u03c1 in B, every quasi-\u03c1-cocycle is bounded on U. A group G is\nsaid to have property (FB ) if the pair G \u2287 G has relative (FFB ).\n(4) ([Mim1]) A group G is said to have property (FFB )/T if for any isometric\nG-representation \u03c1 in B and any quasi-\u03c1-cocycle b, b\u2032 (G) is bounded, where\nb\u2032 : \u0393 \u2192 B/B \u03c1(G) is the natural quasi-cocycle constructed from the projection of\nb associated the canonical quotient map B \u0589 B/B \u03c1(G) . If B is superreflexive,\nthen this definition is equivalent to the following condition: for any isometric\nrepresentation \u03c1 of \u0393 in B and any quasi-\u03c1-cocycle b, b1 (G) is bounded. Here\nwe decompose b as b0 + b1 such that b0 takes values in B0 = B \u03c1(\u0393) and b1 takes\n\u2032\n.\nvalues in B1 = B\u03c1(\u0393)\nIf B = B is a class of Banach spaces, then we define these properties above as having\ncorresponding property for all Banach spaces in the class B.\nThe well-known lemma of Chebyshev center states that for a bounded subset X of\na uniformly convex Banach space B, there exists a unique closed ball with minimimum radius which contains X (the center of this ball is called the Chabyshev center).\nThis implies the following: for a ucus Banach space B, every bounded cocycle into\nan isometric representation in B is a coboundary. Therefore for a superreflexive\n\n\f28\n\nMASATO MIMURA\n\nBanach space, (FFB ) implies (FB ), and (FFB ) for a group G is equivalent to the\nfollowing two conditions:\n\u2022 for any isometric G-representation \u03c1, H 1 (G; \u03c1) = 0;\n\u2022 for any isometric G-representation \u03c1, Hb2 (G; \u03c1) naturally injects into H 2 (G; \u03c1).\n\nWe will employ the following two lemmas in the next subsection:\n\nLemma 7.3. Suppose B is uniformly convex. For an isometric representation \u03c1\nof a group G in B, if there exists \u03be \u2208 B such that supg\u2208G k\u03be \u2212 \u03c1(g)\u03bek < k\u03bek, then\n\u03c1 \u2287 1G .\nThis follows from the lemma of a Chebyshev center.\nLemma 7.4. ([Mim1, Lemma 2.10]) Suppose B is us, G is a finitely generated\ngroup and S is a finite generating set of G. Let N E G. Let \u03c1 be any isometric\nrepresentation of G in B, \u03be be any vector in B and set \u03b4\u03be := sups\u2208S k\u03be \u2212 \u03c1(s)\u03bek. If\na pair G D N has relative (TB ), then\nfor any l \u2208 N, k\u03be \u2212 \u03c1(l)\u03bek \u2264 4K\u22121 \u03b4\u03be .\nHere K stands for the relative Kazhdan constant K(G, N; S, \u03c1) for (TB ), defined as\nK(G, N; S, \u03c1) :=\n\ninf\n\nsup k\u03be \u2212 \u03c1(s)\u03bek.\n\n\u03be\u2208S(B1 ) s\u2208S\n\n\u2032\nHere B1 = B\u03c1(N\n) and S(B1 ) means the unit sphere of B1 .\n\nNote that if G is finitely generated, then relative (TB ) for G D N exactly says\nthat K(G, N; S, \u03c1) > 0 for any finite generating set S \u2286 G and any isometric Grepresentation \u03c1 in B.\nNotable studies have been done for the case of B = Lp , the class of Lp spaces,\nwith p \u2208 (1, \u221e) by P. Pansu [Pan]; Bourdon\u2013Pajot; G. Yu [Yu]; and Bader\u2013Furman\u2013\nGelander\u2013Monod [BFGM]. We shortly states results here. Let for each p, Lp denotes\nthe class of all Lp -spaces.\nTheorem 7.5. Let G be a locally compact and second countable group.\n(i) ([BFGM]) For any Banach space B, property (FB ) implies property (TB ).\n(ii) ([BFGM]) Property (T) is equivalent to property (TLp ), where p \u2208 (1, \u221e). It\nis also equivalent to property (FLp ), where p \u2208 (1, 2].\nMoreover, relative property (T) (for a pair of a group and a normal subgroup)\nis equivalent to relative property (TLp ) for every p \u2208 (1, \u221e).\n(iii) ([BFGM]) Any totally higher rank lattices, in the sense in Subsection 2.2, \u0393\nhave property (FLp ).\n(iv) ([Yu];[Pan]) Any hyperbolic group H, including one with (T), has p0 \u2208 (1, \u221e)\nsuch that for any (\u221e >)p > p0 , H is Lp -Haagerup, namely, H admits a\nmetrically proper cocycle into an isomtric representation in an Lp -space. In\nparticular, Spn,1 fails to have (FLp ) for p > 4n + 2.\nThese result imply the following two points: first, (FLp ) is strictly stronger than\n(T)\u21d4 (FH) = (FL2 ) if p \u226b 2; and secondly, thus (FB ) is stronger than (TB ) in\ngeneral.\n\n\fSUPERIGIDITY INTO MCG\n\n29\n\n7.2. Proof of Theorem 1.5. First, in exactly the same argument as one in Theorem 5.1 we have the following result:\nTheorem 7.6. Let B be a Banach space or a class of them. Suppose a triple\n(G, H, U), where G is a countable group; H 6 G is a subgroup; and U \u2286 G is a\nclosed subset, satisfies both conditions (i), (ii), (iii) in Theorem 5.1 and the following\ntwo conditions:\n(iv \u2032 ) G \u2287 U has relative (FFB );\n(v \u2032 ) G has (TB ).\nThen G has property (FFB )/T.\nNote that Theorem 7.6 deduces (FFB )/T from (TB ) under some condition. Since\n(TB ) is much weaker than (FB ), this implication might be powerful.\nThe following proposition is a key to establish (FFLp ) for universal lattices of\ndegree \u2265 4 in the paper [Mim1] of the author:\nProposition 7.7. ([Mim1, Theorem 6.4]) Let A = Z[x1 , . . . , xk ]. Suppose B is any\nsuperreflexive Banach space. Then, if the pair E2 (A)\u22c9A2 D A2 has relative property\n(TB ), then the pair SL3 (A) \u22c9 A3 > A3 has relative property (FFB ).\nTo prove Theorem 1.5, we will show the following symplectic version of the proposition above:\nProposition 7.8. Let A = Z[x1 , . . . , xk ]. Suppose B is any superreflexive Banach\nspace. If the pairs E2 (A) \u22c9 A2 D A2 ; and E2 (A) \u22c9 S 2\u2217 (A2 ) D S 2\u2217 (A2 ) have relative\nproperty (TB ), then the pair SL3 (A) \u22c9 S 3\u2217 (A3 ) > S 3\u2217 (A3 ) has relative property\n(FFB ).\nProof. Set G = SL3 (A) \u22c9 S 3\u2217 (A3 ) and N = S 3\u2217 (A3 ) E G, and consider G (and N)\nas subgroup(s) in Sp6 (A), as in item (ii) of Definition 4.6. Let \u03c1 be an isometric\nG-representation in B and b : G \u2192 B be an (arbitrary) quasi-\u03c1-cocycle. Take a ucus\n\u03c1-invariant norm on B and fix it (see the paragraph below Proposition 7.1). Take\n\u2032\na decomposition B = B0 \u2295 B1 := B \u03c1(N ) \u2295 B\u03c1(N\n) , and decompose b as b = b0 + b1 ,\nwhere b0 : G \u2192 B0 and b1 : G \u2192 B1 . Then for i = 1, 2, by \u03c1(G)-invariance of Bi , bi\nbecomes a quasi-\u03c1-cocycle.

Recall from Definition 4.2 the\ndefinitions of Bi,j (r) and Di,j (r). Also recall from Lemma 4.3 a finite generating set\nof Sp6 (A).

Since we have already\nverified assertion (A1), we know that b1 (N1 ) is bounded.

Note that the very below\nterm in these inequalities is independent of the choice of \u03b3 \u2208 N2 . Therefore we can\nverify assertion (A2) in a similar way to one in the proof of assertion (A1).\nWe have verified assertions (A1) and (A2), and thus have completed the proof of\nthe theorem.\n\u0003\nProof. (Theorem 1.5) The conclusion follows from Proposition 7.8 and Theorem 5.1,\nin view of Theorem 5.3 (recall from (ii) of Theorem 7.5 that relative property (TLp )\nis equivalent to relative property (T)!). Here again we utilize property (\u2217) in Subsection 5.2, see Theorem 5.4.\n\u0003\n8. Shortcut of Theorem A for universal lattices\nHere we see short and much less involved proof of Theorem C. The key is study\non distorted elements in a group. We prove Theorem C.\nDefinition 8.1. Let G be a finitely generated group. An element g \u2208 G is called\na distorted element if limn\u2192\u221e |g n |S /n = 0. Here S is a finite generating set (the\nchoice of such S does not affect the definition above), and | * |S denotes the word\nlength with respect to S. The element g is said to be undistorted otherwise.\nNote that in the literatures, it is more common to ask a distorted element not to\nbe a torsion. Here we allow torsions as well.\n\n\fSUPERIGIDITY INTO MCG\n\n33\n\nThe following theorems respectively Farb\u2013Lubotzky\u2013Minsky [FLM] (and L. Mosher);\nand E. Alibegovi\u0107 [Ali] state torsions are only distorted elements in MCG(\u03a3);\nOut(Fn ).\nTheorem 8.2. ([FLM],[Mos];[Ali]) Let \u03a3 = \u03a3g.l be a surface and n \u2265 2. Then\nany element respectively in MCG(\u03a3); and in Out(Fn ) which is not a torsion is\nundistorted.\nThis result together with the following also well-known fact is the key in this\nsection.\nProposition 8.3. Groups MCG(\u03a3) for a non-exceptional surface and Out(Fn ) are\nvirtually torsion-free. Namely, there exists finite index torsion-free subgroups.\nBefore proceeding to the proof of Theorem C, we recall the definition of the\nSteinberg group. The Steinberg group over a unital ring R of degree m is defined as\nfollows: it is the group generated by {xi,j (r) : 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 m, i 6= j} (the set of formal\ngenerators) which subjects to the following commutator relations:\nxi,j (r)xi,j (s) = xi,j (r + s),\n[xi,j (r), xk,l(s)] = e\n[xi,j (r), xj,k (s)] = xi,k (rs)\n\nif i 6= l, j 6= k,\nif i 6= k.\n\nThe Steinberg group is written as Stm (R), and there is a natural surjection Stm (R) \u0589\nEm (R), which sends each xi,j (r) to Ei,j (r).\nProof. (Theorem C) Here we only argue the case of H = MCG(\u03a3) targets. Set\nR = Zhx1 , . . . , xk i. By Proposition 8.3, there exists a finite index subgroup of H\nwhich is torsion-free. We choose one and name it H0 .\nLet \u03a8 : \u0393 \u2192 H be a homomorphism. Then \u03a6(\u0393) \u2229 H0 is a finite index subgroup in\n\u03a6(\u0393) and hence \u03930 := \u03a6\u22121 (\u03a8(\u0393) \u2229 H0 ) is a finite index subgroup of \u0393. For distinct\n0\npair (i, j) with 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 m, define a subset of R as Ri,j\n:={r \u2208 R : Ei,j (r) \u2208 \u03930 }.\n0\n\u223c\nis a finite index\nSince for fixed i, j {Ei,j (r) : r \u2208 R}= R as additive groups, Ri,j\nsubgroup in the additive group R.\nNote that if Ei,j (r) \u2208 \u0393, then it is a distorted element in \u0393. This follows form the\ncommutator relation:\n[Ei,j (r), Ej,l (s)] = Ei,l (rs)\n\n(i 6= j, j 6= l, l 6= i; r, s \u2208 R).\n\n0\nBy the construction of H0 , we conclude that for any (i, j) and any r \u2208 Ri,j\n,\n0\n\u03a6(Ei,j (r)) = eH . Indeed, the relation above implies each \u03a6(Ei,j (r)) (r \u2208 Ri,j ) is\ndistorted, and Theorem\nT 8.2 0shows that only distorted element in H0 is eH . We\n0\nnext claim that R := i,j Ri,j is a subring of R. Indeed, the commutator relation\nabove implies is R is closed under multiplication. Therefore R0 is a subring of R of\nfinite index. We use the following theorem of J. Lewin (Lemma 1 in [Lew]): for any\nfinitely generated (possibly noncommutative) ring Q, any finite index subring Q0 of\nQ contains a (two sided) ideal J of Q which is a finite index subring of Q0 . Thus\nwe have a ideal I of R of finite index, which is included in in R0 .\nFinally, we employ the following folklore result (the proof can be found in Lemma\n17 of [KaSa]): for a finite ring S the Steinberg group Stm\u22653 (S) is finite. Now we\n\n\f34\n\nMASATO MIMURA\n\nare done because \u03a6 factors through a subgroup of Stm (R/I), and this group itself\nis finite.\n\u0003\nRemark 8.4. Here is a remark on why this argument does not work for symplectic\nuniversal lattice cases. The finiteness of the Steinberg group over a finite ring is\nextended to general cases, more precisely, twisted Steinberg groups (see Proposition\n4.5 of a paper [Rap] of I. A. Rapinchuk). However, as we have seen in Lemma 4.1, the\ncommutator relation among elementary symplectic groups are much complicated.\nThe gap lies in the point that we have deduced R0 in the proof above is multiplication\nclosed.\nReferences\n[Ali] E.
