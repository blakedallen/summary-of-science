INTRODUCTION\nAutomatic License Plate Recognition from vehicle images\nhas long been an active area for the researchers. In general,\nobjective of such systems is to localize the license plate\nregion(s) from the vehicle images, captured through a roadside camera, and interpret them using an Optical Character\nRecognition (OCR) system.\nALPR systems are widely implemented for automatic\nticketing of vehicles at car parking facilities, tracking vehicles\nduring traffic signal violations and related applications with\nhuge saving of human energy and cost. Any ALPR system\nmay be broadly categorized into two types, namely, an online\nALPR system and an offline ALPR system. In an online\nALPR system, the localization and interpretation of license\nplates take place instantaneously from the incoming video\nframes, enabling real-time tracking of moving vehicles\nthrough the surveillance camera. An offline ALPR system, in\ncontrast, captures the vehicle images and stores them in a\ncentralized data server for further processing, i.e. , for\ninterpretation of vehicle license plates. The current work,\ndiscussed in this paper, comes under the later category of\nsolutions.\nVarious techniques have been developed recently for the\npurpose for efficient detection of license plate regions from\noffline vehicular images. Most of these works [1-4]\nconcentrate on localizing standardized license plate regions\nusing edge based features. Some of these works [2, 5, 6] use\nthe image of a vehicle, well placed in front of a camera, to get\na clear view of the license plate. But in the practical scenario,\n\nthere may be multiple vehicles of different types in a single\nscene along with partial occlusions of the license plates from\nother objects. In one of the earlier works [1], Rank filter is\nused for localization of license plate regions giving bad result\nfor skewed license plates. An analysis of Swedish license plate\nis done in [2] using vertical edge detection followed by\nbinarisation. This does not give better result for non-uniformly\nilluminated plates. An exhaustive study of plate recognition is\ndone in [3] for different European countries. In Greece the\nlicense plate uses shining plate. The bright white background\nis used as a characteristic for license plate in [4]. Spanish\nlicense plate is recognized in [5] using Sobel edge detection\noperator. It also uses the aspect ratio and distance of the plate\nfrom the center of the image as characteristics. But it is\nconstrained for single line license plates. During the\nlocalization phase the position of the characters is used in [6].\nIt assumes that no significant edge lies near the license plate\nand characters are disjoint.\nIn the developed countries and in most of the developing\ncountries the attributes of the license plates are strictly\nmaintained. For example, the size of the plate, color of the\nplate, font face / size / color of each character, spacing\nbetween subsequent characters, the number of lines in the\nlicense plate, script etc. are maintained very specifically. Some\nof the images of standard license plates, used in developed\ncountries, are shown in Fig 1 (a). However, in India, the\nlicense plates are not yet standardized across different states,\nmaking localization and subsequent recognition of license\nplates extremely difficult. Moreover, in India license plates are\noften written in multiple scripts. Fig. 1(b) shows some of the\ntypical Indian license plates with variations in shape, size,\nscript etc. This large diversity in the features of the license\nplate makes its localization a challenging problem for the\nresearch community.\n\n(a)\nFig. 1. License Plate images.\n\n(b)\n\n\fNational Conference on Computing and Communication Systems (COCOSYS-09)\nCS10\n(a). Standardized license plates of European vehicles\n(b). License plates of Indian vehicles\n\nTwo types of license plates are used in India. For\ncommercial vehicles, the plate has a yellow background and\nblack numbering. For private vehicles a white background\nwith black numbering is used. The current Indian vehicle\nregistration scheme comprises of a two-letter identification\ncode for the state, in which the vehicle is registered. It is\nfollowed by a two-digit numeric code to identify the district.\nIn the union territories and the erstwhile union territory of\nDelhi, the district code is omitted. This is often followed by a\nseries code, e.g. 14C is the fourteenth series for private cars\nand 2M is the second series for motorbikes. Recently many\nstates have been adapting the dual letter series code system,\nfor example car series' are CA, CB, CC; motorbike series' are\nMA, MB and so on. Finally a four-digit number is used to\nuniquely identify the vehicle. Most states however still use the\nstandard series code, denoted by a single letter of the alphabet.\nWhen the alphabet reaches Z, the length of the prefix is\nincreased to 2. So after WB-02 9999, the next number is WB02 A 0001 and after WB-02 Z 9999 it is WB-02 AA 0001 and\nso on.\nNot much work has been done on detecting the license\nplates of Indian vehicles. A reference on ALPR of Indian\nvehicles is found in [7]. However, the technical details and the\nperformance of such techniques are yet to be evaluated. In the\nlight of above facts, the objective of the paper is to present a\nnovel technique for localization of license plate regions, an\nimportant step towards development of a complete ALPR\nsystem, from Indian commercial vehicles. In the following\nsection we discuss the basic methodologies employed for the\nimage preprocessing, segmentation and the localization task.\nIn the subsequent sections the experimental results and the\nconclusions are discussed.\nII. PRESENT WORK\nIn our present work we acquired the images using a digital\ncamera placed by the road side facing towards the incoming\nvehicles so that the frontal image of vehicles can be obtained.\nThe snaps are taken automatically at a regular interval of 1\nsecond. This image capturing process is done at three different\nroads of Kolkata at different lighting conditions, even at night.\nThe schematic flow chart of the developed technique,\ndiscussed in this paper, is shown in Fig. 2.\n\nFig. 2. A schematic work flow of the developed technique is shown.\n\n207\n\nOnce all the images have been captured, the rest of the\nprocessing is done in an offline mode. We have first processed\nthe image to make some refinement over it. RGB and HSI\ncolor models are used for all the processes done over the\nimages. The [R, G, B] value of a pixel in the image is read\nfrom the file and the [H, S, I] value is calculated using the\nfollowing conversion formula:\n\n(1)\n\nwhere R, G, B, H, S and I are red color content, green color\ncontent, blue color content, hue, saturation and intensity of a\npixel. Here it is assumed that R, G, and B are normalized\nwithin the range [0, 1]. Hue indicates true color of the pixel,\nsaturation indicates the purity of the color and intensity\nindicates the brightness of the pixel. Hue is measured in terms\nof angle made by the color line with the red axis and varies\nfrom 0 to 360 degrees. The saturation varies from 0 to 1.\nSaturation equals to 0 means pure black and saturation equals\nto 1 means pure color as made by hue. The intensity also\nvaries from 0 to 1. Intensity equals to 0 means pure black and\nintensity equals to 1 means pure white color. Obviously the\nlicense plates have a standard color thereby having a fixed hue\nand saturation with a little variation over them. The intensity\ncomponent over the license plate varies highly over the edges\nof the character written on it. The main idea of our present\nwork is to localize the license plate considering the hue and\nsaturation and then calculate the contrast over the suspected\nregions using the intensity variation over them. Definitely the\ntrue license plate region will produce more contrast per unit\narea than the other places. This will identify the true license\nplate region over the image. A sample image is shown in fig.\n3(a). The major preprocessing operations that have been done\nover each such image are discussed in the subsequent\nsubsections.\nA. Median filtering\nMedian filter is a non-linear filter which replaces the gray\nvalue of a pixel by the median of the gray values of its\nneighbors. We have used 3 \uf0b4 3 mask to get eight neighbors\nand their corresponding color values. As we have processed\nimage three medians corresponding to red, green and blue\ncolors are obtained and combined to get the color value of the\nreplacing pixel. This operation removes salt-and-peeper noise\nfrom the image.\nB. Contrast enhancement\nContrast of each image is enhanced through histogram\nequalization technique, as discussed in [8]. We have applied\nthe process for the intensity component of HSI color model of\nthe whole image. This has the effect of improving the contrast\n\n\fNational Conference on Computing and Communication Systems (COCOSYS-09)\nCS10\nof the image keeping the color information intact. The\nintensity level, within the range [0, 1], is divided equally in\n100 levels having step size of 0.01. The probability of\noccurrence of intensity level ik can be written as:\n(2)\nwhere k=0,1,2,....99 denotes the level number, n k is the\nnumber of pixels having intensity value ik and n is the total\nnumber of pixels in the image. The enhanced intensity value\nis:\n(3)\n\nSince the histogram equalization sometimes introduce more\nintensity into or reduce intensity from the image the saturation\nlevel of the image is slightly increased after histogram\nequalization to get prominence in color [8]. The original\nimage of fig. 3(a), when operated by the median filter,\ngenerates an intermediate image. After the enhancement of\ncontrast of the said image fig. 3(b) is generated.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFig. 3(a-b). A sample vehicle image and the corresponding result after\npreprocessing\n\nC. Preparation of license plate dataset\nAfter filtering and contrast improvement the images\nbecome ready to be dealt with. A large dataset containing the\nimages of the commercial vehicles has been prepared. Now\nfrom each of the images the license plates have been extracted\nmanually and stored as separate images. In this way a dataset\nof the license plates has been made. Fig. 4 shows a sample set\nof license plates of Indian commercial vehicles.\n\n208\nfor R, G, B, H, S and I components of each of the images, both\nfor the yellow background and for the black characters\nseparately. This is done by generating the frequency plot over\nthe respective range scale for each of the color components\nand identifying the two highest peaks, generated for the dark\ncharacters and the yellowish background.\nE. Fixing the seed and tolerance values\nOnce this statistical analysis has been done the next task is\nto identify the seed values for each color component and the\nallowable tolerance limits against each such seed values. The\nmean value of each component is used as seed value for that\ncomponent for segmentation of the image. The standard\ndeviation of each color component is used as tolerance limit\nagainst each such seed value for the respective color\ncomponents.\nF. Image segmentation and connected component labeling\nBased on the seed values of the color components, as\ndiscussed in the previous subsection, the image is segmented\ninto two classes: one indicating the license plate region and\nthe other indicating no plate region. The basic classification\ndepends on the values of H and S color components only.\nDuring the segmentation process, the pixels lying in the\ntolerance of H and S are labeled as LABEL LP indicating it as a\npart of license plate. The pixels lying outside the range of H\nand S is labeled as LABELNLP indicating it as a part of noplate region. After the image has been segmented, the\nconnected components (in terms of pixels) are clustered. There\nmay be one or more connected components depending on the\nsegmentation result. These components are also of irregular\nshape. Now each of the connected components is out bounded\nby a rectangular box (B1). As the boxes are out bounding the\nsegments they may contain components of other segments as\nwell. Thus the boxes may overlap each other.\nG. Finding the potential regions for the license plates\nTo identify the potential region of interest for the license\nplates, the clusters of overlapping boxes need to be\nencompassed with still larger rectangular boxes (B2). Each\nsuch box contains a set of connected boxes (B1). Now there\nmay be one or more B2 boxes indicating the potential regions\nwhere the license plates may lie. To detect the correct regions\nof the license plates, following feature are considered:\ni.\nii.\niii.\niv.\n\nFig. 4. License plates for preparing the dataset\n\nD. Preliminary statistical analysis over the license plates\nWe have developed a technique for reading the license\nplates and computing the mean and standard deviation values\n\nAspect ratio of the license plate\nArea of the license plate in terms of number of\npixels it contains\nFractional area of the license plate relative to the\narea of the whole image\nAverage horizontal contrast density\n\nAll the above parameters are measured for each of the B2\nboxes to get the correct box that may contain the license plate.\nThis box is marked as B3 . The following steps illustrate the\nalgorithm for calculation of the average and maximum\ncontrast of each B2 box in the image frame.\nSteps\n\n\fNational Conference on Computing and Communication Systems (COCOSYS-09)\nCS10\nSet maxcontrast = 0\nFor boxindex = 0 to MAX do\ncontrast = 0\nFor x = XMIN to XMAX do 16\nFor y = YMIN to YMAX do 16\n[R1, G1, B1, H1, S1, I1] = RGB_HSI(x,y)\nlabel = Label(x,y)\nIf label \u2260 LABELLP then go to 16\n[R2, G2, B2, H2, S2, I2] = RGB_HSI(x+1,y)\nlabel = Label(x+1,y)\nIf label \u2260 LABELLP then go to 16\ndR = Abs(R1-R2), dG=Abs(G1-G2), dB=Abs(B1-B2)\nRGBSum = dR + dG + dB\nIf RGBSum <= Cth then go to 16\ncontrast = contrast + RGBSum\nLoop y\nLoop x\nBoxArea = (XMAX-XMIN)\uf0b4(YMAX-YMIN)\nAvg_Contrast = contrast/BoxArea\nIf Avg_Contrast > maxcontrast then maxcontrast =\nAvg_Contrast\nLoop boxindex\n\n209\n\nAs discussed above, within the segment having label as\nLABELLP the contrast between two successive pixels is\naccounted. Here a new expression for calculation of contrast\nhas been used. The sum of R, G and B components is\ncalculated for two successive pixels and the difference\nbetween the two sums is considered as horizontal contrast. It is\nalso considered that if the contrast is more than Cth then only it\nis considered as a prominent edge and only those contrast are\ntaken into account for calculating the average contrast of the\nbox. This eliminates the rough and noisy variation of color\neven within the same segment. Large variation in color\nresulting high contrast will be generated by the digits and\ncharacters within the segments having label as LABELLP.\nOnce the average and maximum contrast of each B2 box is\ncalculated, the next step is to detect the location of the correct\nB3 box containing license plate. Aspect ratio, area and average\nhorizontal contrast density features are considered for each of\nthe B2 boxes for successful localization of B3 boxes. Values of\ndifferent experimental thresholds used during localization of\nthe license plate regions are discussed in the following section.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\n(e)\n\n(f)\n\n(g)\n\n(h)\n\n(i)\n\nFig. 5.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nFor preparation of the dataset, vehicle images are captured\nthrough a fixed camera, installed by the road-side. True color\nbitmap images of resolution 840x630 pixels are captured with\nvarying lighting conditions. The current image dataset consists\nof 500 such images capturing variety of vehicles. In the\ncurrent experiment, we have excluded all the images of private\nvehicles from the image dataset.\nDifferent experimental considerations for localization of\npotential license plate regions are estimated as follows:\nMinimum contrast of a potential B2 box, Cth = 100\nMinimum area of a B3 Box = 2000 pixels\nRange of aspect ratio for B3 boxes : 1.2 to 10\nMaximum contrast difference in B2 boxes, Cdiff= 0.2\nUsing the above considerations, experiments are conducted\nwith the images of commercial vehicles from the generated\ndataset. Figures 5-6 shows different steps of experimental\nresults on the original images, i.e., identification of B1, B2 and\nB3 boxes. Fig. 5(a-i) shows some of the vehicle images with\nsuccessfully localized license plate regions. The technique\ncould successfully localize the license plate even in poor\nlighting conditions, as shown in fig. 5(g-i). Fig. 6(a-c) shows a\nsample image where an additional region is identified as a\nlicense plate. In many of the failure cases, the true license\nplate is identified along with some erroneous license plate\nregions. The technique also fails to localize the boundary of\nthe license plates from some of the completely yellow colored\nvehicles for which license plate color is similar to the body\ncolor of such vehicles.\nFor computation of localization accuracy, we have\nconsidered inaccurate localization of license plates as the false\nnegative cases. Identification of additional license plate\nregions, along with the true license plates, is identified as the\nfalse positive cases and finally the perfect localization of\n\n(c)\n\nlicense plate regions as true positive cases. As observed from\nthe experimentation on the collected dataset of vehicle images,\nthe false negative rate is 10.6%, false positive rate is 16% and\nfinally the true positive accuracy is 73.4%. If we ignore only\nthe false negative cases, then the combined positive accuracy\nmay be estimated as 89.4%, where the technique localizes the\ntrue license plates from vehicle images.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nIn the current work, we have developed a simple and\neffective scheme for localization of license plate regions for\nIndian commercial vehicles. We have extensively applied the\nalgorithm on 500 images. It is seen that in case of completely\nyellow colored vehicles the algorithm does not perform well\nbecause of the similarity of the color of the vehicle and the\nlicense plate, i.e., absence of prominent license plate\nboundaries. In some of such images the output is wrong\nlocalization, in some cases the plate region is detected as very\nlarge locality and in some of the cases other regions are falsely\ndetected as license plate. Despite these difficulties, the\ntechnique fares well in most of the vehicle images, even in\ndarker lighting conditions. Apart from the salt and peeper\nnoise, as discussed in earlier sections, motion blur and other\ntypes of noises often degrade the image quality. Specific\nimage enhancement algorithms may be employed in future to\nimprove the overall performance of the developed system.\nThe technique can further be enhanced by incorporating\nshape based features for yellow/white colored license plates\nand employing soft computing techniques for automatic\nlocalization of license plate regions from commercial and\nprivate vehicle images. The localized license plate regions are\nto be subsequently processed by an effective OCR module for\nextraction of vehicle license numbers.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nAuthors are thankful to the CMATER and the SRUVM project,\nC.S.E.
