While several CVD\nmethods have been developed to grow vertically aligned multi-walled carbon nanotubes\n(V-MWNT), growth of vertical single-walled carbon nanotubes (V-SWNTs) is still in an\nearly stage.(7, 8) The formation of nanotube vertical films is indicative of high yield\ngrowth from densely packed catalytic particles. That is, almost every particle produces a\nnanotube and bundling of neighboring tubes leads to collective vertical growth. A key\nelement in a recent ethylene CVD method that has obtained V-SWNT growth is the\naddition of ~150 ppm water vapor.(8) Another method that has obtained V-SWNT\ngrowth is an alcohol CVD method using ethanol as the carbon feedstock. In both cases,\nthe key role played by the oxygen-containing species is suggested to be oxidation of\namorphous carbon to facilitate SWNT growth.\nThough we have made an effort to utilize both the water-assisted and alcohol CVD\ngrowth methods, we have been unable to obtain vertically aligned SWNTs, which\nindicates the narrow parameter space and growth window of these methods. Also, the\nspecific roles played by the oxygen-containing species remain speculative and require\nfurther investigation. A more detailed understanding could lead to improved and more\nreproducible growth conditions. Here, we present a molecular oxygen assisted plasmaenhanced CVD (PECVD) growth of V-SWNTs at the full 4-inch wafer scale. We find\nthat adding oxygen (~1%) to methane in the PECVD affords highly reproducible growth\nof densely packed SWNTs. Control experiments and knowledge from previous diamond\nPECVD work suggest that the key role played by oxygen in the high yield SWNT growth\n\n\f4\n\nis to balance C and H radicals, and specifically to provide a C-rich and H-deficient\ncondition to favor the formation of sp2-like graphitic SWNT structures. We reveal that\nreactive hydrogen species are generally unfavorable to SWNT formation and growth and\ncan etch pre-formed SWNTs. The negative role of hydrogen and the positive role of\noxygen have important implications to SWNT growth in general by various methods.\nLastly, we present a simple but powerful method to form V-SWNT films for the first time\non any desirable substrate (including metals and plastics) with strong interfacial adhesion.\n\nMethods\nOur nanotube synthesis was carried out in a conventional 4-inch thermal CVD system\nwith an inductively coupled radio-frequency (RF, 13.56 MHz) plasma source located\nnear the entrance of the growth gases.(9) The substrates used were SiO2/Si with\nnominally 1 to 2\u00c5-thick Fe films (by quartz crystal thickness monitoring) deposited by\nelectron beam evaporation. The thin Fe film was first annealed in oxygen at 550\u00b0C for 10\nmin and then heated in hydrogen to the growth temperature of 720\u00b0C. This treatment\nproduced nearly a monolayer of Fe clusters on SiO2 with an average diameter of ~1.3 nm\nas estimated from atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements. We found that the\nformation of dense and relatively uniform particles was essential for V-SWNT growth.\nDuring nanotube growth, the compositions of gases in the tube-furnace were methane\n(~66%), hydrogen (~12%), oxygen (~ 1%) and Ar (~21% as carrier gas) with a total\npressure of 0.3-0.4 Torr. The gas flow rates were CH4/H2/O2=160sccm/30sccm/2.4sccm\n(standard cubic centimeter per minute). Ar was used as carrier gas for CH4 and O2. The\npercentage of partial pressures of various gases followed CH4: H2: O2 =66% : 12% : 1%\n\n\f5\n\n(The rest is Ar). The RF plasma was generated at a power of 60-70 W for 10 to 30 min\nfor nanotube growth. This condition was highly reproducible in growing vertical SWNTs\nfrom run to run and day to day.\n\nResults and Discussions\nOur method produced nearly a monolayer of Fe clusters on 4-inch wafer scale SiO2\n(Fig. 1a) substrates with an average diameter of ~1.3 nm as estimated from atomic force\nmicroscopy (AFM) measurements. We found that the formation of dense and relatively\nuniform particles was essential for V-SWNT growth. With the sub-monolayer catalyst\nseeds and ~1% oxygen added to our CVD, uniformly black nanotube films were grown\non full 4-inch wafers (Fig. 1 b). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that the\nfilms consisted of nanotube strands oriented vertically to the substrate (Fig.1c&1d). The\nlength of the nanotubes is ~ 10 \u03bcm for 10 min growth and scaled approximately with\ngrowth time. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed exclusively SWNTs\nwithout any MWNTs or double-wall tubes (Fig. 1f). The TEM grids were prepared by\nsonicating a V-SWNT covered substrate in a solvent and then drop-drying the suspension\non the grid. Raman spectroscopy (Fig. 1e) of the as-grown samples identified resonant\nradial breathing modes (RBM) of nanotubes in the range of 132cm-1 to 230cm-1,\ncorresponding to nanotubes 1 to 2 nm in diameter.(10) The clear separation between the\nG peaks at ~1580cm-1 and ~1610cm-1 (Fig. 1e) is also characteristic of SWNTs.(10) By\nforming densely packed catalytic seed particles in lithographically defined regions shaped\nin squares, circles or strips, we grew V-SWNTs to form square towers, circular towers or\n\n\f6\n\nsheets replicating the shape of the catalytic regions (Fig.2) with the thickness of the\nsheets down of ~ 100nm (Fig. 2a).\nOur V-SWNT synthesis results are highly reproducible and the optimum O2\nconcentration of ~1% can be easily controlled experimentally. As mentioned earlier, the\nvertical orientation of SWNTs is indicative of high yield growth with close to one-to-one\ngrowth of nanotubes from the seed particles. Through control experiments (Fig. 3a, 3b)\nwith varying concentrations of gases at a fixed temperature and total pressure, several\ngrowth trends emerged and shed light on the role played by oxygen in high yield\nnanotube formation. Without the addition of O2, the same dense-catalyst monolayer\nfailed to produce high yield of SWNTs packing into vertical films under any conditions\ntested. Without the H2 flow on the other hand, vertical SWNTs can still be grown using\nCH4/O2 (Fig. 3a). Growth in CH4/H2 gave extremely low yield of SWNTs (Fig. 3b).\nThese results indicated that H-rich conditions do not favor SWNT growth.\nWe suggest that an important role played by oxygen in enhancing SWNT growth is\nthe removal of reactive H radicals (relative to C-species) that exist in hydrocarbon based\ngrowth of nanotubes, and that high concentrations of H species do not favor the\nformation and growth of sp2-like SWNTs(11) (Fig.3). We first note that the CH4/H2/O2\ngases have been used previously for sp3 diamond synthesis, albeit under H2 rich (>90%)\nand low CH4 (several percent) conditions.(11, 12) Optical emission spectroscopy (OES,\nFig.3c inset) has established that adding oxygen to the CH4/H2 plasma removes the highly\nreactive H radicals via H + O2 \u2192 OH + O with a large rate constant of\nki0~1017cm3/mol*s.(11) Oxygen can also remove and convert C-species into CO via\nvarious reactions, but with lower rate constants (~1014cm3/mol*s).(11) Addition of O2 to\n\n\f7\n\nCH4/H2 CVD can therefore provide an effective route to tune the ratio between C* and H*\nspecies. It has been found that the C*/H* ratio needs to be below a limit (H*-rich) for the\nformation of sp3 structure and high C*/H* ratios favor sp2 carbon formation. The sp2 and\nsp3 carbon formation regimes can be controlled by changing oxygen concentration.(11)\nThese and our SWNT growth results under varying H2 and O2 conditions indicate that\nhigh yield synthesis with CH4/H2/O2 or CH4/O2 is due to oxygen removing H*, which\nremoves or graeatly reduces the negative effect of H species on the growth (Fig.3c).\nOur results lead to the conclusion that a favorable synthesis condition for SWNTs\nshould employ sufficient C-feedstock with few or no reactive H-species. This may be a\ndilemma for hydrocarbon based synthesis of SWNTs since H* is an inevitable product of\nhydrocarbon decomposition. This dilemma can potentially be addressed with controlled\naddition of oxygen to scavenge H*, enhancing the C*/H* ratio and thus favoring sp2 carbon\nproduction. High concentrations of reactive H* species are unfavorable to SWNT\nformation and growth likely due to attacking of the sp2 C by H* to form sp3 structures,(13,\n14) giving low yield growth of SWNTs (Fig.3). Notably, hydrogenation and etching of\nSWNTs by H radicals generated in a plasma is known to occur even at room\ntemperature.(13) To confirm hydrogen attacking of SWNTs, we carried out control\nexperiments and observed etching of pre-formed SWNTs by hydrogen plasma (Fig. 4)\nunder various conditions ranging from room temperature to our typical growth\ntemperature. This result provided direct evidence of the negative effect of reactive H\nspecies to the structures of SWNTs.\nIt is tempting to suggest that oxidizers play a cleansing role by etching amorphous\ncarbon and thus maintaining high catalyst activity for SWNT growth, as suggested by the\n\n\f8\n\nwater and alcohol assisted growth work.(7, 8) This is not the key effect, at least in our\ncase, since we find that amorphous carbon deposition can be avoided by using suitable\nCH4 concentrations via Ar dilution. Without oxygen, the yield of SWNTs (with any\nappreciable length) is low, suggesting the importance of oxygen in the initial nanotube\nnucleation and formation stage and not just during the sustained growth stage. Increased\nH2 presence always leads to systematic decrease in SWNT yield, with or without oxygen\npresence (see Supplementary Information). In our case, due to plasma assisted\ndecomposition, any H2 leads to very high H* concentrations, much more so than in\nthermal CVD. Thus, the observed extremely low yield of SWNTs for CH4/H2 growth\n(H2<10%) strongly suggests the negative blocking effect of H-species to SWNT growth.\nWith this negative H-effect identified, we conclude that the favorable enhancement effect\nof oxygen is via removal of H-species (Fig. 3a vs. Fig. 3b). Indeed, our optical emission\nspectroscopic measurement under our optimum CH4/H2/O2 PECVD clearly identified\nsignificant OH species (Fig. 3c inset), lending direct spectroscopic evidence of the\nreaction of oxygen with H-species in our SWNT growth condition.\nH-scavenging by oxygen species could also be a factor in the high yield SWNT\ngrowth by other methods(7, 8) although the precursors of oxidizing species differ. We\ncarried out a control experiment to elucidate the effect of hydrogen to the growth yield of\nSWNT in the alcohol CVD growth process. We observed that increasing the H2\nconcentration while keeping the alcohol vapor pressure constant systematically reduces\nthe yield of nanotubes (Fig. 5). This provides evidence that hydrogen rich environments\nare also undesirable and have negative effects to the yield of SWNTs in standard thermal\nCVD. Further, a connection can be made with non-hydrocarbon based SWNT synthesis\n\n\f9\n\nmethods such as carbon monoxide CVD.(15, 16) CO-CVD without the involvement of\nhydrogen indeed produces high yield of SWNTs especially under high temperature and\npressure when sufficient C-feedstock is obtained.(15) Other H-free high-yield growth of\nSWNTs includes laser ablation and arc-discharge that vaporizes solid carbon without\ninvolving any hydrogen.\nA major difference between PECVD and thermal CVD is the much higher\nconcentration of reactive radicals in the former. Small variations in the concentrations of\nmolecules in PECVD can strongly affect the outcome of SWNT growth, as shown here\n(Fig. 3). For thermal CVD, the effect of varying the hydrogen concentration is much less\npronounced than in the PECVD case but still noticeable. Two advantages of PECVD over\nthermal CVD are the efficient decomposition of gas molecules and the fact that the\nconcentration of reactive species can be sensitively tuned by the precursor concentration.\nPreviously, many groups have carried out PECVD synthesis of carbon nanostructures but\nhave not succeeded in producing high yield SWNTs. We suggest that an origin of the\ngrowth failure is the unobvious negative role played by reactive H species abundant in\nhydrocarbon PECVD. We believe that by adding suitable amounts of oxygen to the\nvarious types of PECVD systems, and by using dense and relatively uniform catalyst\nparticles, one should be able to readily produce SWNTs at high yields. Oxygen assisted\nPECVD could thus become a powerful and widely used method for efficient production\nof SWNTs. Note that we have attempted adding O2 (0.04-4 percent partial pressure) to\nregular thermal CVD of hydrocarbons(17, 18) without achieving successful growth of\nhigh yield V-SWNTs. This is not understood currently and fine tuning of O2\nconcentration might be needed to enhance SWNT growth in thermal CVD processes.\n\n\f10\n\nWe also note an effect of H-species on the diameter distribution of SWNTs\nsynthesized by CVD. The blocking of SWNT formation by reactive H-species appears to\nbe more pronounced for smaller diameter tubes. Theoretically, smaller SWNTs are more\nsusceptible to hydrogenation by H-species due to higher tube curvature and a higher sp3\nformation tendency.(14) In our H-plasma etching experiments, we observed the trend that\nsmaller SWNTs tended to be attacked preferentially over larger ones, as seen in the AFM\nimages in Fig. 4. This is also consistent with the observation that oxygen-free\nhydrocarbon CVD(17, 18) generally produce large (2-3nm) SWNTs with few tubes \u2264\n1nm (when particles of various sizes <~4-5nm exist). In stark contrast, without hydrogen,\nCO based CVD methods are well known to produce abundant SWNTs in the 0.7-1.5nm\nrange. Our O2 assisted CH4 PECVD presented here also synthesizes abundant SWNTs in\nthe 1nm range (see Raman data in Fig. 1e). The growth of vertical MWNTs should be\nless affected by H-blocking due to the higher stability of larger tubes(14) and have been\nreadily achieved by hydrocarbon CVD without any oxygen assistance.(2-6)\nLastly, we present a novel method for obtaining vertically aligned SWNTs on a\nwide range of substrates including metals and polymers. This goal has been elusive thus\nfar due to the incompatibility of many types of substrates with the high growth\ntemperature of SWNTs, but could be the key to the utility of aligned SWNT materials.\nOur method is simple and involves 'lifting off' the V-SWNT by using HF (1% for 10s) to\netch the underlying SiO2 layer and subsequently free-floating the V-SWNT film on a\nwater surface (Fig. 6a). Following lift-off, the V-SWNTs can be transferred to other\nsubstrates coated with an interfacial thin polymer (50nm polymethylmathacrylate\nPMMA) layer for adhesion (Fig. 6b). After transfer, the substrate is heated to >190\u00b0C,\n\n\f11\n\nwell above the glass transition temperature of PMMA (~105 \u00b0C) for melting of the\npolymer layer and 'gluing' the substrate to the ends of the SWNTs in the vertical film.\nThis affords strongly adhering vertical SWNTs on various substrates including Cu (Fig.\n6b inset), polymers and glasses. The V-SWNT films thus derived are robust and do not\nlift off from substrates even after immersion in ethanol or acetone solvents. This\ndevelopment may greatly expand the utility of V-SWNTs. For instance, it has been\nsuggested that vertically aligned SWNT films can be used as a thermal interface material\nfor heat conduction and dissipation of microelectronics chips. A low temperature process\nis needed to form V-SWNTs on these chips without harming the pre-formed circuitry.\nOur room temperature SWNT transfer approach meets this challenge.\n\nConclusions.\nWe have presented a molecular oxygen assisted plasma-enhanced CVD growth of\nhigh yield of vertically aligned SWNTs at the full 4-inch wafer scale. Various control\nexperiments and knowledge from previous diamond PECVD work revealed the negative\neffect of hydrogen species to the formation and growth of SWNTs as well as etching\neffects of hydrogen plasma to pre-formed SWNTs. The key role played by oxygen in our\nhigh yield SWNT growth is to balance C and H radicals, and specifically to provide a Crich and H-deficient condition to favor the formation of sp2-like graphitic structures. This\nunderstanding has important implications to SWNT growth in general by various\nmethods. With the addition of suitable amount of oxygen to suppress H species, we\n\n\f12\n\nexpect that various types of PECVD setups can produce SWNTs at ultra-high yield and\nefficiency. Further, we present a method to form V-SWNT films for the first time on any\ndesirable substrate (including metals and plastics) with strong interfacial adhesion.\n\nAcknowledgements.

(c) A schematic illustration of the proposed role of oxygen species in hydrocarbon\nbased synthesis of SWNTs. Scavenging of reactive H-species by oxygen shuts off (shown by the\ncross) the negative H-effect to SWNT growth.

The silica catalyst was deposited on a\nlarge silicon piece via spin coating. After spin-coating, the chip was cut into two pieces, and one\nwas used for (A) and the other for (B). The yield of nanotubes is significantly higher in (A) than\nin (B); Surface 'sheet' resistance for (A) and (B) is 25K\u03a9 and 1.2M\u03a9 respectively.\n\nFigure 6.

(a)-(e) Growth results (SEM or AFM images) under various conditions. (f)\nRaman spectra obtained with the various samples except for #3 and #5 due to the low\nSWNT yield. All of the growth experiments were carried out on identically prepared\nsubstrates with the same sub-monolayer Fe nanoparticle catalyst. All growth runs were\ncarried out at the same temperature (720C) and total pressure (0.34 torr) and plasma\npower (70W) for the same amount of time of 10 min. Specific growth conditions are as\nfollows.\n\n\f25\nGrowth Run #1: Regular (normal) growth condition result with CH4/H2/O2. Partial\npressure H2 : O2=12% : 1% (very high yield, SWNTs grown into vertical films).\nGrowth Run #2: H2-free growth condition (no H2 flow used in growth). CH4/O2\nonly. Partial pressure of O2 = 0.8% (very high yield, SWNTs grown into vertical films).\nRemoval of H2 from the regular growth condition can still afford high yield growth, after\nadjusting down O2 partial pressure. H2 is not essential in our regular condition but can\nbe added for balancing purposes.\nGrowth Run #3: O2-free growth condition (no O2 flow used in growth.) CH4/H 2\nonly. Partial pressure of H2 = 7.4% (very low yield of SWNT with H2 but no O2 in growth).\nGrowth Run #4: A CH4/H2/O2 growth condition with high H2 concentration. H2:\nO2=22% : 1% (> 12% : 1% in regular optimum growth condition in #1). (Adding\nexcessive H2 gives lower yield than #1and fails to produce vertically packed SWNTs.\nRather, a mat of SWNTs lying on the substrates was formed).\nGrowth Run #5: CH4 only growth (yield higher than CH4/H2 growth in #3, but\ncannot grow packed V-SWNTs).\nGeneral Trends: (1) Vertical SWNTs were never grown without O2 for the CH4\nPECVD method (in e.g., run #3,#4,#5). (2) Higher H2 conditions give lower yield of\nSWNTs. For CH4/H2/O2 conditions, increasing H2 gives lower yield (e.g, run # 4 vs. #1).\nCH4/H2 (#3) yield lower than CH4 alone (#5) growth.\n\n\f"}
