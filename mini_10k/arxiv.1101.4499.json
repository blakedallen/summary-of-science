The difficulty\nlies generally in coupling such GHz oscillators to photons efficiently, in order to offer optical\ncontrol over the oscillator motion, together with fine optical read-out sensitivity.7 A useful way\n\na)\n\nElectronic mail: lu.ding@univ-paris-diderot.fr\nElectronic mail: ivan.favero@univ-paris-diderot.fr\n\nb)\n\n1\n\n\fto quantify the optomechanical coupling is to use the differential \"frequency pull\" parameter\ngom defined as gom = d!o/d\" expressing how the deformation of the optical resonator \"\nmodifies its optical resonance eigenfrequency !o. In a quantum description of the\noptomechanical interaction at the single photon level, another relevant parameter is the vacuum\noptomechanical coupling g0 given by gomxZPF, where xZPF = ! 2meff \u03c9m is the zero-point\nmotion of the mechanical oscillator, meff its effective motional mass and !m its resonance\nangular frequency. Large optomechanical coupling, approaching gom = !o/\u03bb with \u03bb the\nwavelength of photons, was recently obtained in photonic-crystal based structures.7-9 In this\nwork, we scale the size of GaAs optomechanical disk resonators10 down to \u03bb and show that we\ncan this way naturally couple an (over) GHz mechanical oscillator to an optical cavity of high\nquality factor Q and sub-wavelength mode volume. Thanks to the strong confinement of the\noptical and mechanical modes in a nano-scale disk, we approach gome = !o/\u03bb and obtain a\nvacuum coupling rate g0e = 0.8 MHz.\nOur wavelength-sized GaAs disks stand on christmas-tree-like Al0.8Ga0.2As pedestals11\nand are fabricated from an epitaxial wafer using e-beam lithography and two-steps wet\netching12. The typical disk has a radius R = 1 #m and a thickness of 200 nm, as seen in Fig. 1(a).\nFor such a disk, 2D axis-symmetry finite-element-method (FEM) simulations13 predict in the\n1500-1600 nm range one unique optical whispering gallery mode (WGM) resonance at a\nwavelength of \u03bb0 \u2248 1550 nm. The corresponding WGM is a TE (p = 1, m = 7) mode, where p\nand m are radial and azimuthal numbers respectively.14 The electric field intensity is localized\nat the periphery of the disk [Fig 1(b)]. The free spectral range between two consecutive m\nnumbers of this WGM is \u03bb02/(2\u03c0neffR) \u2248 140 nm, taking R = 1 #m and neff = 2.6 for the effective\n\n2\n\n\findex of the 200 nm GaAs slab TE mode. The mechanical mode of the disk is simulated by 3D\nFEM simulation. Based on our previous work10, we know that axis-symmetry breathing modes\nwith azimuthal number M = 0 couple maximally to WGMs photons. For the present disk, a\nbreathing mode with M = 0 is expected at a frequency around 1.5 GHz. Its 3D deformation\nprofile is shown in Fig. 1(c).\nFigure 1(d) is a schematics of near-field optomechanical experiments on a single disk15,\nwhere light from a mode-hope free tunable external-cavity diode laser (\u03bb = 1500 \u2013 1600 nm,\nlinewidth ~ 150 KHz) is evanescently coupled into the disk using a looped fiber-taper\nmethod.15-16 All experiments and simulations are carried out at a room temperature and\npressure.\nThe optical spectra of three GaAs disks are shown in Figs. 2(a)-(c), at low and high optical\npower. They are recorded from a weak DC component of the fiber output. At low power, the\nsymmetric optical resonance indicates linear behavior of the disk optical mode. The intrinsic\noptical Q reaches 1 \u00d7 104, mainly limited at this wavelength by radiation losses. In our\nexperiments, we measure the optical resonance wavelength with an error inferior to 50 pm.\nFigure 2(d) shows the WGM measured wavelength \u03bbo as a function of the disk radius, the latter\nbeing measured in a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) with an accuracy of \u00b1 50 nm.\nRelying on an epitaxially controlled thickness of 200 nm, the measured wavelength relates\nthrough numerical simulations to a given disk radius (solid squares), which agrees well with the\nmeasured radius (circles with error bar). In our study, the WGM has little dependence on the\npedestal geometry.\nAt high optical power, we observe an important thermo-optic distortion of the optical\n\n3\n\n\fresonance.15,17-18 The strong confinement of optical energy in the disk combines with residual\nabsorption and a poor thermal anchoring to produce significant heating. Figure 2(e) shows the\nrelative optical resonance shift $\u03bb as a function of the power transmitted at the fiber output.\nThe intracavity circulating power is proportional to this optical power transmitted by the fiber.\nRed, green, and blue circles represent disk 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Considering a linear\nthermal-optic effect n(T) = n(300K) + (dn/dT)\u00d7$T and the approximate relation 2\u03c0Rneff = m\u03bb0,\nthe temperature increase corresponding to a shift of the resonance wavelength $\u03bb [Fig. 2(f)] is\n$T = neff/(dn/dT)\u00d7($\u03bb/\u03bb0), where dn/dT = 2.35\u00d710-4 K-1 in GaAs at room temperature19. In\nextreme cases, the resonance shift reaches 100 nm corresponding to a temperature increase\n$T > 700 K at which the disk is irreversibly damaged after desorption of As atoms from the\nGaAs surface20. Note that heating can also induce optical resonance shift by means of direct\nthermal expansion of the disk gallery, in proportion of \"L = 6.05\u00d710-6 K-1, the room temperature\nthermal expansion coefficient21. The associated shift, $\u03bb = \u03bb0\"L$T, is however two orders of\nmagnitude smaller than the thermo-optical shift. This contribution is hence negligible and the\noptical resonance shift observed in our experiments is safely attributed to thermo-optical effects.\nIn Fig. 2(e), the observed approximate linear scaling of the temperature increase with optical\npower is consistent with the fact that the three disks have similar geometry. However the exact\noptical absorption and thermal dissipation mechanisms remain to be investigated and possibly\noptimized for future experiments.\nWhen the laser wavelength is tuned to a flank of the WGM resonance, the disk mechanical\nmotion modulates the transmitted optical power, whose RF noise spectrum becomes a\nvibrational spectrum of the disk. Because the disk mechanical mode of interest resonates over 1\n\n4\n\n\fGHz, we use a high-speed PIN photodetector with 2 GHz bandwidth. We replace electronic\namplification of the detector, which would limit its bandwidth, by optical amplification of the\nsignal at the fiber output, using an erbium-doped fiber amplifier [see Fig 1(d)]. The output of\nthe photodetector is then analysed by a spectrum analyzer. Figures 3(a)-(c) show the obtained\nRF-spectrum of each disk. The mechanical frequency of the breathing mode is found at 1.4\nGHz. Using the disk radius inferred from the optical resonance and pedestal geometry observed\nin the SEM, we simulate numerically the mechanical mode for each disk and obtain a correct\nagreement with experimental frequencies. We estimate that the irregular shape of the pedestal\nleads to an error of \u00b1 50 MHz in the simulated value. At high optical power, the optically\ninduced heating barely modifies the material's elasticity so that the associated mechanical\nfrequency shift, about 1%, is negligible.\nThe optomechanical coupling between the identified optical and mechanical modes is\ncomputed using a perturbative treatment of Maxwell's equations10,22, yielding a simulated\noptomechanical coupling of goms = 690 GHz/nm for disk 1, with a related vacuum coupling of\ng0s = 1.1 MHz (see Table 1 for values on the three disks). The optomechanical coupling can also\nbe measured independently by calibrating the optical measurement knowing that the Brownian\nmotion of the disk is transduced optically in proportion of gom.7,10 For disk 1, this second\nmethod yields an experimental optomechanical coupling of g0e = 0.8 MHz (gome = 485\nGHz/nm), a factor 1.4 times smaller than the FEM-estimated value. Similar discrepancies were\nobserved in photonic crystals strucutres7-9 and probably stem from an imperfect control of the\ngeometry obtained by nanofabrication. Table 1 lists mechanical and optomechanical\nparameters of the three studied disks. The calibrated Brownian motion of disk 1 is plotted in Fig.\n\n5\n\n\f3(d), showing a sensitivity of a few 10-17 m/%Hz, which is only a factor 100 above the Standard\nQuantum Limit imprecision23. The second disk in the table possesses a larger pedestal than the\ndisk seen in Fig. 1(a). This results in a less confined optical WGM and a reduced effective\nmotional mass. The optomechanical coupling is consequently reduced with respect to the two\nother disks.\nIn summary, wavelength-sized GaAs optomechanical disk resonators with mechanical\nfrequency over the GHz are observed. The vacuum optomechanical coupling go is measured to\nrise up to the MHz with associated gom of 500 GHz/nm. This strong optomechanical interaction\nmakes GaAs disks an interesting platform to study quantum-optomechanics at the single\nphoton level24, especially since solid state single photons emitters in form of InAs quantum\ndots25 are already being inserted in such disks in quantum electrodynamics experiments26,27.\n\nThis work was supported by C-Nano Ile de France.\n\n1\n\nI.
