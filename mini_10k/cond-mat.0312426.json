It\ntherefore exhibits no long-range order in 1D. In contrast\nthe PI is characterized by dominant charge-density-wave\n(CDW) correlations and true long-range order because a\ndiscrete symmetry is broken. While the gaps to both spin\n(\u2206s ) and charge (\u2206c ) excitations are finite in the PI, the\nspin gap vanishes in the 1D MI, which is related to spin\n\nFIG. 1: Schematic phase diagram of the Holstein-Hubbard\nmodel at half-filling.\n\ncharge separation. In a strict sense these results hold\nin the adiabatic limit (\u03c90 = 0) for \"U -only\" (Hubbard\nmodel) and \"\u03bb-only\" (Peierls model) parameters. At finite phonon frequency and U = 0 (Holstein model) a critical electron-phonon (EP) coupling is required to set up\nthe CDW phase characterized by alternating doubly occupied and empty sites.7 The concomitant gap formation\nand metal-insulator transition has recently been studied\nin the limit of infinite dimensions.8 Depending on the adiabaticity ratio \u03b1 = \u03c90 /t the PI represents a traditional\nband insulator (\u03b1 \u226a 1) or a bipolaronic insulator (\u03b1 \u226b 1,\ng 2 = \u03b5p /\u03c90 \u226b 1).9 Although for the more general HHM\nthe situation is much less clear, we expect that the features of the insulating phase will depend markedly on\nthe ratio of Coulomb and EP interactions u/\u03bb, allowing\nfor quantum phase transitions between insulating phases.\nIndeed, based on recent numerical results for the staggered spin- and charge-structure factors, it has been argued that the HHM shows a crossover between Mott and\nPeierls insulating phases at u/\u03bb \u2243 1.10 More precisely, for\n\n\f2\nfinite periodic chains, the MI-PI quantum phase transition could be identified by a ground-state level crossing\nassociated with a change in the parity eigenvalue P .4\nNote that this scenario differs from the (weakly interacting) HHM with frozen phonons10 , where there is strong\nevidence in favor of two quantum critical points, as in\nthe ionic Hubbard model.11,12\nThe aim of this work is to establish the physical picture\ndeveloped to date for the interplay of spin, charge and\nlattice degrees of freedom in the 1D Holstein Hubbard\nmodel. In particular we attempt to verify the proposed\nphase diagram by examining the single-particle excitations. For these purposes we employ Lanczos exact diagonalization (ED)13 , kernel polynomial14 , and densitymatrix renormalization group (DMRG)15,16 methods to\ndetermine the (inverse) photoemission spectra as well as\nthe spin and charge excitation gaps. These quasi-exact\nnumerical techniques allow us to obtain reliable results\nfor all interaction strengths with the full quantum dynamics of phonons taken into account. Exact diagonalizations are seriously limited in achievable system sizes\nN , but have the advantage that spectral quantities are\neasily accessible. Complementary, the DMRG algorithm\nyields specific eigenstates of large systems by implementing a renormalization scheme and an optimal truncation\nof the Hilbert space. Thus it permits for a finite-size analysis of the ground-state energies in different particle and\nspin sectors, which is required to determine the behavior of the various excitation gaps in the thermodynamic\nlimit.\nWe begin by studying the spectral density of singleparticle excitations associated with the injection of a\nspin-\u03c3 electron with wave number K, A+\nK\u03c3 (\u03c9) (inverse\nphotoemission (IPE)), and the corresponding quantity\nfor the emission of an electron, A\u2212\nK\u03c3 (\u03c9) (photoemission\n(PE)), where\nX\n(N )\n(Nel \u00b11) \u00b1\nA\u00b1\n|h\u03c8m\n|cK\u03c3 |\u03c80 el i|2\nK\u03c3 (\u03c9) =\nm\n\n(Nel )\n\n(Nel \u00b11)\n\u00d7\u03b4[ \u03c9 \u2213 (Em\n\u2212 E0\n(N )\n\n)]\n\n(2)\n\n\u2020\n\u2212\nel\ni is the ground\nwith c+\nK\u03c3 = cK\u03c3 and cK\u03c3 = cK\u03c3 . |\u03c80\n(N \u00b11)\nstate of the system with Nel electrons and |\u03c8m el i are\n(N )\neigenstates of the (Nel \u00b1 1)-particle system.

Adding the\nspectral densities of (photo-) emission and absorption\nwe obtain the spectral function AK\u03c3 (\u03c9) = A+\nK\u03c3 (\u03c9) +\nA\u2212\n(\u03c9),\nwhich\nobeys\nvarious\nsum\nrules\nand\nallows\nfor a\nK\u03c3\nconnection to angle-resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy\nR\u221e\n(ARPES). The simplest sum rule, \u2212\u221e AK\u03c3 (\u03c9)d\u03c9 = 1,\nreflects the normalization of AK\u03c3 (\u03c9) but is not useful for\nARPESP\nsince\nR \u221eit involves both occupied and unoccupied\nstates.\n\u03c3 \u2212\u221e nF (\u03c9)AK\u03c3 (\u03c9)d\u03c9 = n(K) (where nF (\u03c9)\nis the Fermi function) is more important, since it relates\nthe ARPES intensity to the number of electrons in a moP\nmentum state K: n(K) = \u03c3 hc\u2020K\u03c3 cK\u03c3 i. The ED results\npresented for A\u00b1\nK\u03c3 (\u03c9) in the following were obtained for\n\nan eight-site system with periodic boundary conditions.17\nLet us first consider the MI regime. Figure 2 displays the IPE and PE spectra for the HHM at the\nallowed wave numbers of our finite system: K =\n0, \u00b1\u03c0/4, \u00b1\u03c0/2, \u00b13\u03c0/4, and \u03c0. To reliably monitor a\npossible band splitting induced by the Hubbard and EP\ncouplings at half-filling it is necessary to guarantee that\nthe Fermi momenta KF = \u00b1\u03c0/2 are occupied, which is\nthe case for N = 4l (l integer, periodic boundary conditions). The most prominent feature we observe in the\nMI regime is the opening of a gap at K = \u00b1\u03c0/2, indicating massive charge excitations. A comparison with\nthe results obtained for the pure Hubbard model classifies this gap as the Mott-Hubbard correlation gap. Its\nvalue \u2206/t \u2243 3.25 almost coincides with the optical gap\n\u2206opt we determined by evaluating the regular part of\nthe optical conductivity for the same parameters. The\ndispersion of the lower (upper) Hubbard band can be derived tracing the uppermost (lowest) excitations in each\nK sector. Due to the finiteness of our system and the\nrather moderate value u = 1.5, PE (IPE) excitations\nwith K = \u00b13\u03c0/4 and \u03c0 (K = \u00b1\u03c0/4 and 0) have still finite spectral weight. This canRbe seen from the integrated\n\u03c9\n\u00b1\n\u2032\n(\u03c9) = \u2213\u221e d\u03c9 \u2032 A\u00b1\nspectral densities SK\u03c3\nK\u03c3 (\u03c9 ), which, in\n\u2212\n+\naddition to the sum rule SK\u03c3 (\u2212\u221e) + SK\u03c3 (\u221e) = 1, sat\u00b1\n\u00b1\nisfy the relations SK,\u03c3\n(\u00b1\u221e)+S\u03c0\u2212K,\u03c3\n(\u00b1\u221e) = 1 (K \u2265 0).\nSince the spectral weight of the PE excitations with\nK > \u03c0/2 is expected to vanish as N goes to infinity for\nu \u226b 1, the lower\nR \u2212\u221eHubbard band will be completely filled\nP\n( |K|\u2264KF ,\u03c3 \u221e d\u03c9A\u2212\nK\u03c3 (\u03c9) \u2243 Nel ), and consequently\nthe system behaves as an insulator at T = 0.20 As a\nresult of the coupling to the phonon system the electronic levels in each K sector split, creating phonon side\nbands. The distinct peaks are separated by multiples of\nthe bare phonon frequency and can be assigned to relaxation processes of the Q = 0 phonon modes.21 The\n\u00b1\n(\u03c9)\nnumber of phonons involved is controlled by g 2 . SK\u03c3\nshows clearly that the total spectral weight of the resulting excitation bands equals the weight of the respective\nelectronic excitations in the pure Hubbard model. Interestingly, mediated by Q 6= 0 phonons, there appear\n\"shadows\" of the band belonging to a dominant electronic excitation in a certain K sector in other K sectors,\ngiving rise to a weak \"breather-like\" excitation22 , which\nis almost dispersionsless in the Brillouin zone.\nIf we decrease the Hubbard interaction at fixed EP\ncoupling strength the Mott-Hubbard gap weakens and finally closes at about (u/\u03bb)c \u2243 1, which marks the MI-PI\ncrossover. This is the situation shown in Fig. 3. Approaching the critical point from above and below, the\nground state and the first excited state become degenerate. These states have different eigenvalues P of the siteinversion operator P c\u2020i\u03c3 P \u2020 = c\u2020N \u2212i \u03c3 (i = 0, . . . , N \u2212 1)\nand we have verified that the ground-state site parity is\nP = +1 in the MI and P = \u22121 in the PI. Obviously the\ncritical point is characterized by gapless charge excitations at the Fermi momenta but should not be considered\n\n\f3\n2\n\n2\n\nK=0\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n2\n\n0\n2\nK=\u00b1\u03c0/4\n\nK=\u00b1\u03c0/4\n\n1\n\n1\n\nAK\u03c3(\u03c9), AK\u03c3(\u03c9)\n\n\u2212\n\n0\n2\nK=\u00b1\u03c0/2\n\nMI\n\n0\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n2 u=1.5\n\u03bb=0.35\n1 \u03b1=0.1\n\n0\n2\n\n+\n\n0\n2\nK=\u00b13\u03c0/4\n\n0\n-6\n\n-4\n\nK=\u03c0\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n\u03c9\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n1\n\nFIG. 2: Wave-number-resolved spectral densities for photoemission (A\u2212\nK\u03c3 (\u03c9); red lines) and inverse photoemission\n(A+\nK\u03c3 (\u03c9); black lines) in the Mott insulating state (u/\u03bb \u226b 1).\n\u00b1\nThe corresponding integrated densities SK\u03c3\n(\u03c9) are given by\ndashed lines.

As a result the electronic band structure becomes gapped again (see Fig. 4 (upper panel)). The\nform of the spectra, however, is quite different from MI\ncase. While in the MI regime the lowest peak in each\nK sector is clearly the dominant one, in the BI phase\n\nrather broad (I)PE signatures appear. Within these excitation bands the spectral weight is almost uniformly\ndistributed, which is a clear signature of multi-phonon\nabsorption and emission processes that accompany every\nsingle-particle excitations in the PI.

With respect to the metal the electron-electron coupling favors\nthe Mott insulating state whereas the electron-phonon\ninteraction is responsible for the Peierls insulator to occur. The PI typifies a band insulator in the adiabatic\nweak-to-intermediate coupling range or a bipolaronic insulator for non-to-antiadiabatic strong-coupling. Our results for the single-particle spectra and spin/charge excitation gaps give clear indication of a Mott- to Peierlsinsulator quantum phase transition at u/\u03bb \u2243 1. Quantum phonon dynamics yields pronounced effects in the\n(I)PE spectra, which might be of great importance for interpreting photoemission experiments of low-dimensional\nstrongly correlated electron-phonon systems such as MXchain compounds.1\nWe gratefully acknowledge stimulating discussions\nwith F.
