The CP-even\nand CP-odd scalars are mixed in this model, which affects the production processes of neutral Higgs\nboson. We examine the correlation of the Higgs production at LHC and ILC and provide a strategy\nto distinguish the model from the CP conserving model and to determine the parameters of the\nHiggs sector.\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe Higgs boson is the only unobserved ingredient of the standard model (SM), which is responsible for the\nelectroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) and the generation of fermion masses. It is the principal motivation of the\nproposed future collider experiments to search for the Higgs boson and examine the underlying mechanism of the\nEWSB. The SM Higgs boson is expected to be discovered and its mass and production cross section to be measured\nat the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [1, 2], while the complementary study on the detailed structure of the\nHiggs sector will be performed at the future e\u2212 e+ linear collider (ILC) [2].\nConventional wisdom is that the standard model is not the final theory but just an effective theory of the fundamental\nstructure. The Higgs sector is generically extended when we consider the new physics beyond the SM because the new\nphysics usually has larger symmetry than the SM and then more symmetry breaking is required than the minimal\nEWSB. The two Higgs-doublet (2HD) model is one of the simplest extension of the Higgs sector, which consists of two\nscalar SU(2) doublets. In the 2HD model, the physical states are three neutral scalars and a pair of charged scalars\nafter the Goldstone modes are eaten up by the W and Z bosons. When both Higgs doublets couple to all fermions,\ntheir Yukawa coupling matrices cannot be simultaneously diagonalized with the mass matrices of fermions. Then\nthe off-diagonal matrix elements exist in general, which gives rise to the flavor-changing neutral current (FCNC)\nmediated by a neutral Higgs boson at tree level. Thus one has to constrain the Yukawa couplings arbitrarily, or\nintroduce another symmetry to suppress the FCNC, e.g. an approximate flavor symmetry [3]. The phenomenological\nimplications of the FCNC to the collider signal and flavor physics have been widely studied [4, 5]. A natural flavor\nconservation (NFC) has been suggested in order to avoid the dangerous FCNC by imposing a discrete symmetry on\nthe Higgs and fermion fields [6]. We choose the discrete symmetry such that one Higgs doublet couples to up-type\nquarks and the other doublet couples to down-type quarks to get rid of the tree level FCNC. This is also the Higgs\nstructure of the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM). Such a discrete symmetry on the Higgs doublet\nfields forbids the Higgs sector to contain the CP violating terms. Therefore, the CP is the manifest symmetry of the\ntheory and the physical states of neutral scalars are two CP-even Higgs bosons H and h and one CP-odd Higgs boson\nA.\nAssuming the breakdown of the discrete symmetry in the Higgs sector, complex Higgs self-couplings exist in general,\nand consequently the explicit and/or spontaneous CP violation is allowed in the Higgs sector. In such a case H, h and\nA are no more CP eigenstates and the CP-even and CP-odd states are mixed. The Higgs boson couplings to gauge\nbosons and fermions also depend upon the mixing angle between the CP-even and CP-odd Higgs bosons and so does\nthe production of neutral Higgs bosons at the future colliders. Even it is possible that the production cross section\nof the Higgs boson is suppressed to be missed at colliders in some parameter space although the Higgs boson mass\nis low enough to be produced at such colliders. However, if one neutral Higgs boson production may be suppressed,\n\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\u2021\n\ncskim@yonsei.ac.kr\nchyu@korea.ac.kr\nkylee@muon.kaist.ac.kr\n\n\f2\nother Higgs boson production processes will be enhanced instead according to sum rules of Higgs couplings and we\ncan find the evidence of Higgs boson in general. Analysis to search for the neutral Higgs boson at the e\u2212 e+ collider\nin the CP violating 2HD model has been performed in the Refs. [7, 8, 9]. In this work, we consider the Higgs sector\nwith soft violation of the discrete symmetry in the 2HD model and discuss its implication for the neutral Higgs boson\nproduction at LHC and ILC.\nThis paper is organized as follows: In section 2, we briefly review the general 2HD model with non-zero CP violation\nand define the physical neutral Higgs bosons. Possible scenarios are examined in section 3 and correlation of LHC\nand ILC is discussed in section 4. Finally we conclude in section 5.\nII.\n\nTHE MODEL\n\nThe general Higgs potential of the 2HD model is given by\nV =\n\n1\n1\n\u03bb1 (\u03c6\u20201 \u03c61 )2 + \u03bb2 (\u03c6\u20202 \u03c62 )2 + \u03bb3 (\u03c6\u20201 \u03c61 )(\u03c6\u20202 \u03c62 ) + \u03bb4 (\u03c6\u20201 \u03c62 )(\u03c6\u20202 \u03c61 )\n2\n2\n1\n\u2020\n2\n+ [\u03bb5 (\u03c61 \u03c62 ) + H.c.] + [\u03bb6 (\u03c6\u20201 \u03c61 )(\u03c6\u20201 \u03c62 ) + \u03bb7 (\u03c6\u20202 \u03c62 )(\u03c6\u20201 \u03c62 ) + H.c.]\n2\n\u2212m211 (\u03c6\u20201 \u03c61 ) \u2212 m222 (\u03c6\u20202 \u03c62 ) \u2212 [m212 (\u03c6\u20201 \u03c62 ) + H.c.],\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03bb5 , \u03bb6 , \u03bb7 and m212 are complex parameters and others are real. The discrete symmetry \u03c61 \u2192 \u2212\u03c61 or \u03c62 \u2192 \u2212\u03c62\nis imposed in order to avoid a dangerous FCNC, which leads to the absence of m212 , \u03bb6 and \u03bb7 . We allow soft violation\nof the discrete symmetry by the dimension 2 terms m212 6= 0 in this work for the explicit CP violation.\nThe potential is minimized with the vacuum expectation values\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\n1\n1\n0\n0\n, h\u03c62 i = \u221a\n,\n(2)\nh\u03c61 i = \u221a\ni\u03be\n2 v1\n2 v2 e\nwhere v12 + v22 = v 2 = 4m2W /g 2 and the phase \u03be leads to the spontaneous CP violation. The minimization of the\npotential (1) at h\u03c61 i and h\u03c62 i yields the relation\nIm(m212 ei\u03be ) = v1 v2 Im(\u03bb5 e2i\u03be ).\n\n(3)\n\nThe global transform \u03c6i \u2192 \u03c6i ei\u03c6i preserves the potential invariant with the rephasing; \u03bb5 \u2192 \u03bb5 e\u22122i(\u03c62 \u2212\u03c61 ) , m212 \u2192\nm212 e\u2212i(\u03c62 \u2212\u03c61 ) and \u03be \u2192 \u03be + \u03c62 \u2212 \u03c61 while \u03bbi (i = 1, * * *, 4) and m211,22 are not changed. Thus we can choose \u03be = 0\nindicating no spontaneous CP violation but the wholly explicit CP violation. Then the parameter Im m212 can be\nreplaced by Im \u03bb5 , which plays the role of the order parameter of the CP violation.\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\nThe charged states are the Goldstone mode G\u00b1 = \u03c6\u00b1\n1 cos \u03b2+\u03c62 sin \u03b2, and the charged Higgs mode H = \u2212\u03c61 sin \u03b2+\n\u00b1\n2\n2\n2\n\u03c62 cos \u03b2 with the mass mH \u00b1 = [Re m12 /v1 v2 \u2212 \u03bb4 \u2212 Re \u03bb5 ]v /2 and tan \u03b2 = v2 /v1 . In this paper, we concentrate\non the neutral Higgs boson production and do not pay attention to the charged states. In order to pick out the\nphysically allowed set of the Higgs potential parameters, however, we have to assume the charged Higgs boson mass\nin our numerical analysis.\nThe neutral states are defined by\n\u221a\nG0 = 2(Im \u03c601 cos \u03b2 + Im \u03c602 sin \u03b2),\n\u221a\nA0 = 2(\u2212Im \u03c601 sin \u03b2 + Im \u03c602 cos \u03b2),\n\u221a\n\u03c61 = 2Re \u03c601 ,\n\u221a\n\u03c62 = 2Re \u03c602 .\n(4)\nThe mass matrix of neutral Higgs bosons is constructed as the form\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nR sin2 \u03b2 + \u03bb1 cos2 \u03b2\n(\u03bb3 + \u03bb4 + Re \u03bb5 \u2212 R) vv1 v2 2 \u2212 21 Im \u03bb5 v 2 sin \u03b2\nM2 = v 2 \uf8ed (\u03bb3 + \u03bb4 + Re \u03bb5 \u2212 R) vv1 v2 2\nR cos2 \u03b2 + \u03bb2 sin2 \u03b2\n\u2212 21 Im \u03bb5 v 2 cos \u03b2 \uf8f8 ,\n1\n1\n2\n2\n\u2212 2 Im \u03bb5 v cos \u03b2\nR \u2212 Re \u03bb5\n\u2212 2 Im \u03bb5 v sin \u03b2\n\n(5)\n\nwhere R = Re m212 /v1 v2 . The non-zero off-diagonal elements M213 and M223 indicate the CP violation, since three\nneutral scalars are mixed and no more CP eigenstates. The parameter Im \u03bb5 is the only CP violating parameter in\nthis model.\n\n\f3\nWe diagonalize the mass matrix by the orthogonal transformation\nM2d = RM2 R\u2020 ,\nwhere the orthogonal matrix R can be parameterized by 3 Euler angles \u03b8a , \u03b8b , \u03b8c\n\uf8f6\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f6\uf8eb\n\uf8eb\n\u2212sa ca 0\ncb 0 sb\n1 0 0\nR = \uf8ed 0 cc sc \uf8f8 \uf8ed 0 1 0 \uf8f8 \uf8ed ca sa 0 \uf8f8\n0 0 1\n\u2212sb 0 cb\n0 \u2212sc cc\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\u2212cb sa\nca cb\nsb\n= \uf8ed ca cc + sa sb sc sa cc \u2212 ca sb sc cb sc \uf8f8 ,\n\u2212ca sc + sa sb cc \u2212sa sc \u2212 ca sb cc cb cc\n\n(6)\n\n(7)\n\nwhere sa,b,c = sin \u03b8a,b,c and ca,b,c = cos \u03b8a,b,c . The choice of the angle \u03b8a is different from other angles to follow the\nconvention of the mixing angle between CP-even Higgs bosons. Hereafter we set \u03b1 \u2261 \u03b8a by convention.

(5) is reduced to that of the CP conserving case, where the\nCP-even and CP-odd Higgs bosons are separated. This is corresponding to the case of \u03b8b = \u03b8c = 0 in the matrix\nR. A few interesting scenarios for nonzero but limiting values of \u03b8b and \u03b8c are considered at each experiment in this\nsection.\nA.\n\nthe CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC)\n\nWe expect that the SM Higgs boson will be discovered at LHC and its mass and the cross section will be measured.\nThe dominant production channel of the neutral Higgs boson at LHC is the gluon fusion process, pp \u2192 gg \u2192 h.\nSince the cross section for the neutral Higgs boson production crucially depends upon Higgs couplings, the large\ndeviation of the measured cross section from the SM prediction indicates the evidence of the new structure of the\nHiggs sector. Even it is possible that we cannot discover the lightest Higgs boson due to the suppressed coupling with\nsome combination of \u03b1, \u03b8b , \u03b8c and tan \u03b2 although the Higgs mass is small enough to be observed at LHC. Here, we\nexamine a scenario where this dominant channel (pp \u2192 gg \u2192 h) is blind at LHC for three neutral Higgs bosons. The\ncross section for the lightest neutral Higgs boson is given by\n\u0012 2\n\u0013\ncos \u03b1 cos2 \u03b8b\ncos2 \u03b2 sin2 \u03b8b\n\u03c3(gg \u2192 h1 ) =\n(11)\n* \u03c3SM (mh1 ).\n+\nsin2 \u03b2\nsin2 \u03b2\nThe orthogonality of the matrix R gives rise to a sum rule for ratios of cross sections as\n3\nX\n\u03c3(gg \u2192 hi )\n1 + cos2 \u03b2\n=\n> 1,\n\u03c3SM (mhi )\nsin2 \u03b2\ni=1\n\n(12)\n\n\f4\nwhere \u03c3SM (m) is the SM cross section with the Higgs mass m. The cross section \u03c3(gg \u2192 h1 ) vanishes in the limit of\ncos2 \u03b1 \u2192 0, sin2 \u03b8b \u2192 0. In this limit, the cross section for h2 is given by\n\u0013\n\u0012 2\ncos2 \u03b2 sin2 \u03b8c\ncos \u03b8c\n(13)\n* \u03c3SM (mh2 ).\n+\n\u03c3(gg \u2192 h2 ) =\nsin2 \u03b2\nsin2 \u03b2\nThus if cos2 \u03b8c \u2192 0 and tan \u03b2 is sufficiently large, \u03c3(gg \u2192 h2 ) is also suppressed and we cannot find h2 through\npp \u2192 gg \u2192 h process at LHC. Finally we consider the heaviest Higgs boson h3 . Since the first and second cross\nsections are suppressed, the cross section \u03c3(gg \u2192 h3 ) should be larger than the SM cross section of the corresponding\nmass due to the sum rule of Eq. (12), and h3 should be observed through this channel. Now if we assume that mh3\nis too heavy to be produced at LHC, then no neutral Higgs boson is observed at LHC through pp \u2192 gg \u2192 h process.\nConsequently neutral Higgs bosons are blind through this channel at LHC in such a scenario.\nLet us test the above 'blind' scenario in more detail. Actually m3 is not a free parameter in this model when other\nHiggs boson masses and mixing angles are fixed. In the Fig. 1, we show the value of m3 with respect to tan \u03b2 in the\nlimit considered here. We find that m3 is bounded above, and such a complete blind scenario is not plausible. In\npractice, we need not take a strict limit of cos \u03b8/ sin \u03b8 \u2192 0, but it is enough if the signal is too small to be extracted\nfrom the large background of the hadron collider. We set the condition, cos2 \u03b1, sin2 \u03b8b , cos2 \u03b8c < 0.01, in this analysis.\nHiggs boson masses m1 and m2 are varied up to 1 TeV which is the experimental bound for the SM Higgs boson to\nbe found at LHC. For the numerical analysis, we demand the following constraints on the model parameters; (1) the\nperturbativity on the quartic couplings, \u03bbi /4\u03c0 < 1, (2) the ordering of Higgs masses, m1 < m2 < m3 . If tan \u03b2 is large,\nthe b quark Yukawa coupling is also large so that the contribution of b quark loop becomes important. Including\nthe contribution of b quark loop contaminates the relations in our discussion. However, as we can see in Fig. 1, the\nfavored value of tan \u03b2 is less than 10, and we can safely assume that the top quark loop dominates in pp \u2192 gg \u2192 h\nprocess.\nB.\n\nthe future e\u2212 e+ linear collider (ILC)\n\nThe phenomenology of the Higgs sector at the e\u2212 e+ linear colliders is governed by couplings of the Higgs bosons\nto gauge bosons. We write generalized hi ZZ couplings here:\nh1 ZZ \u221d sin(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1) cos \u03b8b ,\nh2 ZZ \u221d cos(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1) cos \u03b8c \u2212 sin(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1) sin \u03b8b sin \u03b8c ,\nh3 ZZ \u221d \u2212 cos(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1) sin \u03b8c \u2212 sin(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1) sin \u03b8b cos \u03b8c ,\n\n(14)\n\nwhich are normalized by the SM coupling gmZ / cos \u03b8W . Due to the orthogonality of R, these couplings satisfy a few\nsum rules, which can be found in the literatures [7, 10].\nIf we assume that sin \u03b8b \u223c 0 and cos \u03b8c \u223c 0, h2 is decoupled and identified with the CP-odd Higgs boson A. In the\nlimit that cos \u03b8b \u223c cos \u03b8c \u223c 0, h1 is decoupled to be A. In both cases, Higgs-gauge couplings ghi ZZ and ghi hj Z go close\nto those of the CP conserving case. Thus these limiting cases are similar to the CP conserving case except for the\npossibility that the lightest Higgs may be the CP-odd Higgs boson.\nMore interesting scenario is obtained by taking the limit sin \u03b8c \u2192 0. In this case, the off-diagonal elements of the\nmass matrix of neutral Higgs bosons become\nM213 = sa cb sb (m23 \u2212 m22 ),\nM223 = \u2212ca cb sb (m23 \u2212 m22 ).\n\n(15)\n\nComparing the ratio M213 /M223 from Eq. (15) with the same ratio given in Eq. (5) leads to tan \u03b2 = \u2212 tan \u03b1 and thus\n\u03b2 = \u2212\u03b1. The CP violating parameter Im \u03bb5 is directly related to \u03b8b and Higgs masses,\nIm \u03bb5 = sin 2\u03b8b\n\nm23 \u2212 m22\n.\nv2\n\n(16)\n\nIf we additionally assume that sin \u03b8b is close to 1, the lightest Higgs boson decouples to be the CP-odd Higgs and\nheavier Higgses h2 and h3 are mixed with each other. The ghi ZZ and ghi hj Z couplings are given by\nh1 ZZ \u221d \u01ebb sin(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1),\nh2 ZZ \u221d cos(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1),\nh3 ZZ \u221d \u2212 sin(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1),\n\n(17)\n\n\f5\nwhere \u01ebb = cos \u03b8b . This limit may look like the CP conserving case since the CP-odd Higgs decouples. However, we\nsee that the ratio |gh2 ZZ /gh3 ZZ | = 1/ tan(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1), while |ghZZ /gHZZ | = tan(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1) for the CP conserving case. It may\nbe a clue to discriminate this scenario from the CP conserving model in the gauge-Higgs sector without the manifest\nobservation of the CP asymmetry [9].\nIV.\n\nINTERPLAY BETWEEN LHC AND ILC\n\nIt is natural that the first evidence of the Higgs boson will be discovered at LHC before ILC. Thus we can assume\nthat the lightest Higgs boson mass and corresponding cross section will be measured at LHC without loss of generality.\nWe define \u2206 to be the ratio of the cross section of pp \u2192 gg \u2192 h in our model to the SM cross section of corresponding\nmh ,\n\u2206\u2261\n\n\u03c3(pp \u2192 gg \u2192 h1 )\n,\npp\n\u03c3SM\n(mh1 )\n\n(18)\n\npp\nwhere \u03c3SM\n(mh1 ) is the SM cross section of pp \u2192 gg \u2192 h channel with the Higgs boson mass mh1 . The mixing angle\n\u03b8b is expressed in terms of \u2206 and other angles such as\n\ncos2 \u03b8b =\n\n\u2206 sin2 \u03b2 \u2212 cos2 \u03b2\n,\ncos2 \u03b1 \u2212 cos2 \u03b2\n\n(19)\n\nwhen cos2 \u03b1 6= cos2 \u03b2. If the measured cross section deviates from the SM prediction, \u2206 6= 1, it directly indicates a\nnew structure of the Higgs sector.\nThe most promising channel at ILC is the Higgsstrahlung process e\u2212 e+ \u2192 Zhi . In the CP conserving model, the\nCP-odd Higgs boson A does not couple to the gauge boson. So the observation of ZA production is a direct evidence\nof the CP violating model in principle. However, it is hard to tag A or h in the Higgsstrahlung process due to its spin\n0 nature. Moreover in our case, the produced neutral Higgs boson is not a pure CP eigenstates but a mixed one. Thus\nit is impossible to find the ZA production in our model. Let us first assume that we have the minimal information of\nthe Higgs sector from LHC at the moment when the e\u2212 e+ linear collider starts running: e.g. the lightest Higgs mass\npp\nhave been already determined. The cross section of\nmh1 and the ratio of the cross section \u03c3(pp \u2192 gg \u2192 h1 )/\u03c3SM\n\u2212 +\ne e \u2192 Zhi is\ne\n(mhi )\n\u03c3(e+ e\u2212 \u2192 hi Z) = fi2 \u03c3SM\n\n(20)\n\ne\nwhere fi are the normalized hi ZZ couplings given in Eq. (14) and \u03c3SM\n(mhi ) is the SM cross section for e+ e\u2212 \u2192 hi Z\nprocess with corresponding Higgs mass. For given mh1 and \u2206, we can rewrite\n\nf12 = sin2 (\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1)\n\n\u2206 sin2 \u03b2 \u2212 cos2 \u03b2\n,\ncos2 \u03b1 \u2212 cos2 \u03b2\n\n(21)\n\nassuming cos2 \u03b1 6= cos2 \u03b2. In Fig. 2, we plot the cross section \u03c3(e\u2212 e+ \u2192 Zh1 ) with respect to the measured \u2206.\nValues of tan \u03b2 is assumed to be fixed since tan \u03b2 can be measured in separate processes, e.g. charged Higgs sector,\nwhile \u03b1 is varied.\nNext we assume that we have already measured cross sections for 2 channels at LHC, \u03c3(gg \u2192 h1 ) and \u03c3(gg \u2192 h2 ),\nand, however, measured only one cross section at ILC. This is a very likely assumption since the CM energy of ILC is\nmuch lower than LHC. In such a scenario, we can critically discriminate the CP violating model with CP conserving\nmodel. In the CP conserving model, \u03b8b , \u03b8c = 0, the cross sections at LHC are\n\u2206LHC1 \u2261\n\ncos2 \u03b1\n\u03c3(gg \u2192 h1 )\n=\n,\n\u03c3SM (mh1 )\nsin2 \u03b2\n\n\u2206LHC2 \u2261\n\nsin2 \u03b1\n\u03c3(gg \u2192 h2 )\n=\n,\n\u03c3SM (mh2 )\nsin2 \u03b2\n\n(22)\n\nwhile the cross section at the ILC is given by\n\u2206ILC \u2261\n\n\u03c3(e\u2212 e+ \u2192 h1 Z)\n= sin2 (\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1).\n\u03c3SM (mh1 )\n\n(23)\n\nThen these observables satisfy the relation\np\n\u2206LHC2 (1 \u2212 \u2206ILC ) = ( \u2206LHC1 \u2206ILC \u2212 1)2 ,\n\n(24)\n\n\f6\nwhich is the surface on (\u2206LHC1 , \u2206LHC2 , \u2206ILC ) plane. Since this relation is derived in the CP conserving two Higgs\ndoublet model, a deviation of any observable from this relation indicates the CP violating model and/or more complex\nHiggs structure. In Fig. 3, we show a contour plot on this relation. We assume that the measurement of \u2206LHC1\nagrees with the SM prediction. The contour is corresponding to \u03b8b = \u03b8c = 0 and we plot the departure with \u03b8b 6= 0\nand \u03b8c = 0 case. The \u03b8c 6= 0 and \u03b8b = 0 provides a line perpendicular to this plane.\nV.\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nThe neutral Higgs boson production processes have been explored together at LHC and ILC in the context of the\ntwo Higgs-doublet model with non-zero CP violation. Because of the spin 0 nature, it is hard to get the direct CP\nviolating signals from the neutral Higgs sector. Instead, by investigating the combined production rate at LHC and\nILC, we can find out if the CP violating signal to indicate the scalar-pseudoscalar mixing. We suggest a few limiting\ncases which shows characteristic phenomenology in the neutral Higgs boson production and a strategy to determine\nthe Higgs mixing angles at ILC with the data obtained from LHC.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe work of C.S.K. was supported in part by CHEP-SRC Program and in part by the Korea Research Foundation\nGrant funded by the Korean Government (MOEHRD) No. KRF-2005-070-C00030.
