We provide a\nnew proof, that involves extensive use of the Bockstein spectral sequence.\nAMS Classification 16W30; 57T05, 55T99\nKeywords Hopf algebras, Bockstein spectral sequence\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nLet R be a subring of the rationals containing 1/2. A Hopf algebra up to homotopy, or Hah, is an augmented chain R-algebra A, equipped with an algebra\nmorphism \u2206 : A \u2192 A \u2297 A that is homotopy-coassociative and homotopycocommutative. We will suppose that the augmentation provides a strict counit for \u2206. A Hah morphism is an algebra morphism that commutes with the\ndiagonals up to chain algebra homotopy.\nThe aim of this paper is to present an alternate proof of the following theorem\nof D. Anick.\nAnick's Theorem [2, Theorem 5.6] Let \u03c1 > 2 be the least non-invertible\nprime in R, and let q \u2265 1. If A is a Hah whose underlying algebra is free and\ngenerated by the range of dimensions q through q\u03c1 \u2212 1, inclusive, then A is\nisomorphic as a Hah to a primitively-generated chain Hopf algebra.\nAnick's theorem was one of the more important recent developments in rational\nhomotopy theory. Applied to the Adams-Hilton model of a space X , it allows\nrational homotopy theorists to apply their techniques to decidedly non-rational\nproblems. Indeed, as outlined in [4], the singular cochain complex C \u2217 (X; R) is\nthen weakly equivalent to a commutative cochain algebra that plays the role\nof the algebra of polynomial differential forms, AP L (X), in rational homotopy\ntheory.\nc Geometry & Topology Publications\n\n\fJonathan Scott\n\n120\n\nThe proof provided by Anick is quite technical, and involves constructing a\n\"partial inverse\" to the diagonal map. In the present paper, the author proposes\na proof that uses nothing more than the Bockstein spectral sequence as detailed\nin Browder [3], and the results on Hopf algebras from Milnor and Moore [5].\nThe key to the new proof of Anick's theorem is Theorem 1.1 below, where we\nconsider the result of adjoining a free algebra variable to a primitively-generated\nchain Hopf algebra. First we introduce some terminology. A free monogenic\nextension of a chain algebra A is a chain algebra (A \u2210 T (x), dx = b) where \u2210\ndenotes the free product of algebras, b \u2208 Adeg x\u22121 is a cycle, and T (x) is the\ntensor algebra on the graded module R{x}. If A is a cocommutative chain Hopf\nalgebra, then a free monogenic extension of Hopf algebras up to homotopy is a\nfree monogenic extension of A along with a homotopy-coassociative, homotopycocommutative choice of reduced diagonal \u03a6 \u2208 (A\u2297A)deg x for x. A good reference for the homotopy theory of chain algebras is Anick's paper [2]. Effectively,\nto say that \u03a6 is a \"homotopy-coassociative\" and \"homotopy-cocommutative\"\nchoice means that there exist elements f \u2208 A \u2297 A \u2297 A and g \u2208 A \u2297 A such that\n(\u2206 \u2297 1 + 1 \u2297 \u2206)\u03a6 = df and (\u03c4 \u2212 1)\u03a6 = dg . If \u03a6 = 0 then we call the extension\ntrivial.

Suppose A \u2192 A \u2210 T (x) is a free\nextension of Hopf algebras up to homotopy, with \u2202x primitive. If deg x < q\u03c1,\nthen the extension is isomorphic to the trivial one.\nTheorem 1.1 will be proved in Section 2.\nProof of Anick's Theorem Let A = T V be a Hopf algebra up to homotopy.\nLet {vj } be a well-ordered basis of V , where we have chosen an ordering such\nthat deg vi < deg vj implies that i < j . Suppose inductively that A(i\u22121) =\nT (v1 , . . . vi\u22121 ) is a primitively generated Hopf algebra. Adding the generator\nvi yields the chain algebra extension\nA(i\u22121) \u2192 A(i\u22121) \u2210 T (vi )\nAlgebraic & Geometric Topology, Volume 5 (2005)\n\n\fHopf algebras up to homotopy and the BSS\n\n121\n\n \u0304 i = \u03a6. It is easy to see that [\u2202vi ] is primitive in H(A(i\u22121) ). By\nwhere \u2206v\nLemma 2.2 below, Hm (P (A(i\u22121) \u2297 Zp )) \u223c\n= P Hm (A(i\u22121) \u2297 Zp ) if m < q\u03c1, for all\nprimes p in R. Since P (A(i\u22121) \u2297 Zp ) = P (A(i\u22121) ) \u2297 Zp in these degrees, we\nconclude that Hm (P A(i\u22121) ) \u223c\n= P Hm (A(i\u22121) ), and so we may choose \u2202vi to be\nprimitive in P (A(i\u22121) ). Now we may apply Theorem 1.1.\nRemark 1.2 Anick assumes a homotopy counit, but then goes on to show\nthat every Hah is isomorphic to one with a strict counit [2, Lemma 5.4].\nWe use the usual definitions for chain algebras, coalgebras, Hopf algebras, and\nhomotopies of chain algebra morphisms [2, Section 2]. Algebras are assumed\nto be connected and augmented to the ground ring. The linear dual of a chain\ncomplex V is denoted V \u2217 .\nThe author would like to take this opportunity to thank Jean-Claude Thomas\nand Jim Stasheff, for useful comments and suggestions, as well as the referee,\nwhose recommendations led to a major reworking of the article. The end result\nis more elementary, less technical, more accessible, and just plain better.\n\n2\n\nThe Proof of Theorem 1.1\n\nLet p be an odd prime, and denote by Zp the field of integers modulo p. We\nprove a proposition about cocommutative extensions of Hopf algebras over Zp .\nWe then prove several lemmas that allow us to manage the Bockstein spectral\nsequence, before proving the inductive step, Proposition 2.8. We finish the\nsection with the proof of Theorem 1.1 proper.\nWe begin by quickly reviewing some facts about Hopf algebras, gleaned from the\nstandard reference of Milnor and Moore [5]. Let C be a connected, associative,\ncoassociative, graded Hopf algebra with multiplication \u03bc : C \u2297C \u2192 C , diagonal\n\u2206 : C \u2192 C \u2297 C and augmentation \u03b5 : C \u2192 R. Let I(C) = ker \u03b5. The space of\n \u0304 : I(C) \u2192\nindecomposables of C is the quotient I(C)/\u03bc(I(C) \u2297 I(C)). Let \u2206\n \u0304 = \u2206c \u2212 c \u2297 1 \u2212 1 \u2297 c.\nI(C) \u2297 I(C) be the reduced diagonal, defined by \u2206c\n \u0304\nThen P (C) = ker \u2206 is the subspace of primitive elements. The natural map\nI(C) \u2192 Q(C) restricts to define a map P (C) \u2192 Q(C), natural with respect to\nmorphisms of Hopf algebras.\nDenote by T C(V ) the tensor coalgebra on V . As a graded module, T C(V ) =\nT (V ) = \u2295n\u22650 V \u2297n . Elements of V \u2297n are traditionally denoted [v1 | * * * |vn ]. The\nAlgebraic & Geometric Topology, Volume 5 (2005)\n\n\fJonathan Scott\n\n122\n\ndiagonal is defined by\nn\nX\n[v1 | * * * |vj ] \u2297 [vj+1 | * * * |vn ].\n\n\u2206[v1 | * * * |vn ] =\n\nj=0\n\nIn particular, P (T C(V )) = V . Note that, if V is finite type and free as a\ngraded R-module, then (T V )\u2217 = T C(V \u2217 ) as a graded coalgebra.\nWhile the following proposition likely qualifies as folklore, we provide a proof\nnonetheless.\nProposition 2.1 Let A be a connected, primitively-generated Hopf algebra\nof finite type over Zp . Suppose that\nA \u2192 A \u2210 T (x)\nis a coassociative and cocommutative extension. If A is (r \u2212 1)-connected and\ndeg(x) < rp, then A \u2210 T (x) is primitively generated.\nProof Set B = A\u2210T (x). Dualize the extension A \u2192 B to obtain a morphism\nof connected commutative Hopf algebras f : B \u2217 \u2192 A\u2217 . It suffices to show that\nthe natural morphism P (B \u2217 ) \u2192 Q(B \u2217 ) is injective. Let \u03be : B \u2217 \u2192 B \u2217 be the\nFrobenius map defined by \u03be(x) = xp . Then \u03beB \u2217 is a sub Hopf algebra of B \u2217 .\nBy [5, Proposition 4.21], there is an exact sequence\n0 \u2192 P (\u03beB \u2217 ) \u2192 P (B \u2217 ) \u2192 Q(B \u2217 )\nso it suffices to show that P (\u03beB \u2217 ) = 0.\nLet V = Q(A) and W = Q(B), so that W = V \u2295 Zp {x}. Let \u03c3 : V \u2192 A be\na splitting of the natural projection \u03c0 : I(A) \u2192 V . Extend \u03c3 to a splitting\n\u03c4 : W \u2192 B of \u03c1 : I(B) \u2192 W . Then \u03c3 and \u03c4 extend to algebra epimorphisms\nT V \u2192 A and T W \u2192 B such that the diagram of algebra morphisms\n//\nTV\n\u001f\n\n// T W\n\u001f\u001f\u001f\n\u001f\u001f\n\u001f\u001f \u03c4\n\u001f\u001f\n\u000f\u000f\u000f\n// B\n\n\u001f\u001f\n\u001f\u001f\n\n\u03c3\n\n\u001f\u001f\n\u001f\u001f\n\u000f\u000f\u000f\n\nA //\n\ncommutes.

Then the morphisms P (\u03c3 \u2217 ) : P (A\u2217 ) \u2192 P (T C(V \u2217 )) = V \u2217 and P (\u03c4 \u2217 ) : P (B \u2217 ) \u2192 P (T C(W \u2217 ))\n= W \u2217 are also monic. Furthermore, P (g) : W \u2217 \u2192 V \u2217 is the canonical projection that kills x\u2217 , the basis element dual to x \u2208 W . Suppose bp \u2208 P (\u03beB \u2217 ) \u2282\nP (B \u2217 ). Then P (\u03c4 \u2217 )(bp ) = \u03b1x\u2217 + v \u2217 , according to the direct sum decomposition\nW \u2217 = Zp {x\u2217 } \u2295 V \u2217 . Then 0 = P (\u03c3 \u2217 )P (f )(bp ) = P (g)P (\u03c4 \u2217 )(bp ) = P (g)(\u03b1x\u2217 +\n\u03b2v \u2217 ) = v \u2217 , so v \u2217 = 0. Therefore P (\u03c4 \u2217 )(bp ) = \u03b1x\u2217 . But deg bp \u2265 rp > deg x\u2217\nso \u03b1 = 0. Since P (\u03c4 \u2217 ) is a monomorphism, bp = 0 and the result follows.\nLet A be a chain Hopf algebra over Zp ; that is, A is simultaneously a Hopf\nalgebra and a chain complex, such that the differential \u2202 is both a derivation and\na coderivation. Then H(A) is naturally a Hopf algebra. Let iA : P (A) \u2192 A be\nthe natural inclusion of the primitive subspace. Then H(iA ) : H(P A) \u2192 H(A)\nfactors through the inclusion iH(A) : P H(A) \u2192 H(A) to yield a morphism\nj : H(P A) \u2192 P H(A).\nLet A be a chain Hopf algebra such that \u2202 = 0 on A<n .

The differential is the\n2\nderivation determined by the rule \u2202x = y . Then P A = Zp {y, x, xp , xp , . . .}. It\n2\nfollows that H(P A) = Zp {xp , xp , . . .}. On the other hand, H(A) = Zp [xp ] \u2297\n2\n\u2227(xp\u22121 y), so P H(A) = Zp {xp\u22121 y, xp , xp , . . .}. So j : H(P A) \u2192 P H(A) fails\nto be surjective in degree 2np \u2212 1.\nExample 2.4 Let B = \u2227(x) \u2297 Zp [y], with deg x = 2n + 1. The differential\n2\nis given by \u2202x = y .

Therefore j :\nH(P B) \u2192 P H(B) is not injective.\nLet A be a connected primitively-generated Hopf algebra of finite type over\nZ(p) , the ring of integers localized at p. Recall from [3] that the Bockstein\nspectral sequence of A in homology modulo p, denoted (E r , \u03b2 r ), is a spectral\nsequence of primitively-generated Hopf algebras over Zp that converges\n\u0012\n\u0013\nH(A)\n1\nE = H(A; Zp ) \u21d2\n\u2297 Zp .\ntorsion\nWe now introduce some notation to avoid confusion when following elements\nup and down the terms of the spectral sequence. Let C be a chain complex,\nand denote by E r its Bockstein spectral sequence modulo p. If x \u2208 C is a\ncycle modulo p that survives to the r th term of the spectral sequence, then we\ndenote its equivalence class in E r by [x]r . In particular, [x]2 = [[x]1 ], and so\non.\nThe following elementary lemma clarifies what it means for one element to be\nthe higher Bockstein of another.\nAlgebraic & Geometric Topology, Volume 5 (2005)\n\n\fHopf algebras up to homotopy and the BSS\n\n125\n\nLemma 2.5 Let C be a chain complex and denote by E r the r th term of\nthe Bockstein spectral sequence of C modulo p. Suppose ar , br \u2208 E r satisfy\n\u03b2 r ar = br . Suppose further that a, b \u2208 C represent ar and br , respectively.\nThat is, a and b are cycles modulo p that survive to E r , where [a]r = ar and\n[b]r = br . Then there exist c, e \u2208 C such that d(a + pc) = pr (b + pe).\nProof We proceed by induction on r. For r = 1, if a is a cycle modulo p,\nthen da = px for some x \u2208 C . By definition, \u03b2 1 [a]1 = [x]1 , so [x]1 = [b]1 .\nThus there exist elements c, e \u2208 C such that x = b + pe \u2212 dc. Therefore\nda = px = pb + p2 e \u2212 d(pc) and the statement holds, grounding the induction.\nAssume that the lemma is true for r = k \u2212 1 for some k \u2265 2, and suppose\nthat \u03b2 k [a]k = [b]k . Since a survives to the k th term of the spectral sequence,\n\u03b2 k\u22121 [a]k\u22121 = 0. Applying the inductive hypothesis, we find that there exist\nelements f, g \u2208 C such that d(a + pf ) = pk g . By definition, \u03b2 k [a]k = [g]k .\nThus [g]k = [b]k , so [g \u2212 b]k = 0, that is, there exists some y \u2208 C that survives\nto E k\u22121 , where [g \u2212 b]k\u22121 = \u03b2 k\u22121 [y]k\u22121 . By the inductive hypothesis, there\nexist elements z, e \u2208 C such that d(y + pz) = pk\u22121 (g \u2212 b \u2212 pe). Therefore\nd(a + pf ) = pk g = pk b + pk+1 e + d(py + p2 z). Rearranging, we find that\nd(a + p(f \u2212 y \u2212 pz)) = pk (b + pe). Set c = f \u2212 y \u2212 pz to complete the inductive\nstep and the proof.\nCorollary 2.6 If [b\u2032 ]r = [b\u2032 ]r in E r , then there exist elements e, f \u2208 C such\nthat pr\u22121 b\u2032 = pr\u22121 b\u2032\u2032 + pr e + df .\nProof Since [b\u2032 ]r = [b\u2032\u2032 ]r , there exists a \u2208 C such that \u03b2 r\u22121 [a]r\u22121 = [b\u2032 \u2212\nb\u2032\u2032 ]r\u22121 .

Then [bi ]r+i is primitive by equation (2). Let {[b]r+i } denote the homology class of [b]r+i in\nH(P E r+i ).

By Lemma 2.2, there exists [z]r+i \u2208 P E r such that\n[b]r+i = \u03b2 r+i [z]r+i . By repeated application of Lemma 2.2, we may suppose\n \u0304 = p\u03a8.
