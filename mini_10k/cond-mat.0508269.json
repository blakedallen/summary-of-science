We find\nthat (i) ferromagnetic order of the Mn layer is energetically favorable relative to antiferromagnetic,\nand (ii) the heterostructure is a two-dimensional half metallic system. The metallic behavior is\ncontributed by three majority-spin bands originating from hybridized Mn-d and nearest-neighbor\nSi-p states, and the corresponding carriers are responsible for the ferromagnetic order in the Mn\nlayer. The minority-spin channel has a calculated semiconducting gap of 0.25 eV. Analysis of the\ntotal and partial densities of states, band structure, Fermi surfaces and associated charge density\nreveals the marked two-dimensional nature of the half metallicity. The band lineup is found to\nbe favorable for retaining the half metal character to near the Curie temperature (TC ). Being Si\nbased and possibly having a high TC as suggested by an experiment on dilutely doped Mn in Si, the\nheterostructure may be of special interest for integration into mature Si technologies for spintronic\napplications.\nPACS numbers: 75.50.Pp, 71.15.Mb, 71.70.Gm, 72.80.Cw\n\n1\n\n\fDoping magnetic transition metal elements into semiconductors has attracted much attention recently, especially the doping of Mn in GaAs[1], which has inspired much interest\nin the new and immensely promising field of spintronics [2, 3, 4]. Since 2000, a new class\nof potential spintronic materials has been discovered: the half metallic transition metal\npnictides with zincblende structure. Two such compounds, CrAs[5] and CrSb[6], have been\ngrown in thin film form. Many other pnictides and carbides[7, 8, 9] have been predicted\nbased on first-principles calculations in the generalized gradient approximation (GGA)[10].\nRelated quantum structures, such as superlattices[11, 12, 13] and quantum dots[14], have\nalso been studied. Sanvito and Hill[15] investigated the half metallic properties of a digital\nferromagnetic heterostructure (DFH) composed of a layer of Mn in GaAs. The key property\nof all such half metallic materials is the 100 % spin polarization at the Fermi energy, EF .\nTherefore, the magnetoresistance (MR) effect is expected to be much larger and becomes\ninfinite in the ideal case. Devices made of these materials, such as MR sensors, memories\nand switches, will have superior qualities to the ones presently available. However, the realization of devices based on these materials has been hindered by difficulties in growth and\nfabrication processes involving III-V compounds. Fabrication techniques for Si based devices\nare more mature; and so they might be more readily manufactured, if corresponding half\nmetallic devices could be engineered. The prediction of ferromagnetic order in Mn-doped\nbulk Si[16] and the growth of dilutely doped Mn in Si[17, 18] have been reported. The\nexperimental results are particularly encouraging because the measured Curie temperature,\nTC , is over 400 K, in stark contrast to Mn-doped GaAs which suffers from a TC far below\nroom temperature. A critical shortcoming of Mn-doped GaAs with respect to spintronic\napplications might thus be surmounted by such Si based materials.\nHere, we report our design of a DFH consisting of a \u03b4-doped layer of Mn in a Si substrate\n(Mn/Si-DFH), with a \u03b4 function (single layer) doping profile along the growth direction,\nand our prediction that this DFH is a two-dimensional half metal. We find that the metallic\nproperties are contributed by extended states originating from hybridized Mn-d and nearestneighbor Si-p majority-spin states, while the minority-spin channel is semiconducting with\na 0.25 eV gap.\nWe employed planewave pseudopotential density-functional methods[19], in the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) to exchange and correlation[10].\n\nUltra-soft\n\npseudopotentials[20] were used to facilitate the accurate treatment of transition metal atoms.\n2\n\n\fThe heterostructure was modeled by a unit cell consisting of 32 atoms in layers along the\n[001]-direction of epitaxial growth, as shown in Fig. 1. The unit cell is tetragonal with a and\n\u221a\nb axes along the [110]- and [1\u030410]-directions, and lattice constant a0 / 2, where a0 = 5.45\n\u00c5 is the optimized lattice constant of Si crystal. The indices are defined with respect to the\nconventional cell. We have checked the effect of the thickness of the Si region from 15 to 39\nSi layers along the [001]-direction. The half metallic properties and the density states of the\nmajority-spin at EF remain unaffected. The gap between the lowest unoccupied state in the\nminority-spin channel and EF is 0.15 eV at 15 Si layers separation and stabilized to 0.16 eV\nat separations of 31 Si layers or more. Further details will be presented elsewhere[21]. The\nseparation between Mn layers in neighboring cells was sufficient to make cell-cell interactions\nnegligible, as we discuss below. A planewave cutoff of 450 eV and Monkhorst-Pack[22] mesh\nof 11 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 1 k-points was used in all calculations. Larger k-point sets were employed to\nverify convergence of the above set to the order of 1 meV/atom. Wigner-Seitz sphere radii\nof 1.35 \u00c5 and 1.32 \u00c5 were used for Mn and Si atoms, respectively, to construct projected\ndensities of states. Atomic positions were optimized by conjugate-gradient minimization of\nthe total energy.\nThe magnetic moment per unit cell, density of states at the Fermi energy, and energy\ndifference between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic ordering for the unrelaxed and relaxed cases are given in Table 1. Without lattice relaxation, the magnetic moment is an\ninteger, 3.0 \u03bcB . There is a gap of 0.20 eV in the minority-spin states. The effect of lattice\nrelaxation is small because the optimized lattice constant of Si (5.45 \u00c5) is close to that of\n(hypothetical) zincblende MnSi (5.48 \u00c5)[21]. The gap for the relaxed case opens slightly to\n0.25 eV. Both with and without relaxation, the ferromagnetic phase has lower energy than\nthe antiferromagnetic phase. Since the relaxation effect will not alter our conclusions about\nDFH, in the following, we focus our analysis on the unrelaxed case.\nThe total and partial densities of states (PDOS) for the majority- and minority-spin\nchannels are shown in Fig. 2. The PDOSs show projections onto the Mn, nearest Si (Si(I)),\nand farthest Si (Si(II)) atoms. Considering first the majority-spin states, we find a finite\ndensity of states at EF , as shown in the top panel. The states in a 3 eV range around EF\n(from \u223c \u22121 to +2 eV) show strong hybridization between Mn-t2g and Si(I)-p states (second\nand third panels). In contrast, there is no significant contribution from the more distant\nSi(II) atoms. The bonding states centered \u223c 2.6 eV below EF exhibit correspondingly\n3\n\n\fTABLE I: Comparison of the unrelaxed and relaxed cases for Mn \u03b4-doped in Si. The magnetic moment m, density of states at the Fermi energy N (EF ) per eV-unit cell, ferromagnetic\u2013\nantiferromagnetic energy difference EF A , and minority-state gap Eg are listed. The difference\nEF A = EF M \u2212 EAF M between FM and AFM ordering is calculated for the unit cell with one\nMn-Mn pair. For both cases, the FM ordering has lower energy.\nm(\u03bcB )\n\nN (EF )\n\nEF A (meV)\n\nEg (eV)\n\nUnrelaxed\n\n3.0\n\n1.06\n\n-523.91\n\n0.20\n\nRelaxed\n\n3.0\n\n1.25\n\n-442.38\n\n0.25\n\nstrong Mn-t2g \u2013Si(I)-p character. The nonbonding Mn-eg states are located \u223c 2.5 eV below\nEF , concentrated in a somewhat narrower range of about 1 eV. The conduction states \u223c 2\neV above EF and higher are contributed mainly by the Si atoms. Considering now the\nminority-spin channel, we find a semiconducting gap of \u223c 0.20 eV between valence and\nconduction bands. The valence states are mainly bulk Si, with one band of Mn-t2g \u2013Si(I)-p\ncharacter at \u223c 1 eV below EF . The conduction states originate from both antibonding p\u2013t2g\nhybrid states and nonbonding eg states of the Mn, leading to a peak at \u223c 0.5 eV. The more\ndistant Si(II) atoms contribute a broad manifold extending to 4 eV below EF , much as in\nSi crystal. The results indicate that the interaction of the Mn atom is confined primarily to\nits nearest-neighbor Si(I) atoms.\nThe band structure along symmetry lines in the kx -ky plane (\u0393-R-X-\u0393) and along the kz direction (\u0393-Z) in the energy range \u22121.5 to 1.5 eV is shown in Fig. 3. The sizes of the circles\nindicate the contribution from Mn-d states: larger circles indicate larger contributions. In\nFig. 3(a), three majority-spin bands pass through the Fermi energy in the kx -ky plane. We\nlabel these bands 1, 2 and 3. The lowest energy states of the three bands are at the R\npoint and are occupied. Around the \u0393 point, the three bands are unoccupied. As discussed\nabove in PDOS, the states in the vicinity of EF contributing to the conduction originate\nfrom the hybridization of Mn-t2g and (near-neighbor) Si(I)-p states. Along \u0393-Z, the marked\nflatness of the associated bands indicates the negligible interaction between Mn planes: the\nstates are extended along the planes and well localized perpendicular to them, forming a\nmetallic two dimensional sheet of majority carriers only. Compared to the corresponding\nbands along \u0393-X of the Mn/GaAs DFH studied by Sanvito and Hill [15], the partially filled\n4\n\n\fbands in Mn/Si-DFH are substantially broader, reflecting the more ionic character of the\nAs atoms relative to Si. In Fig. 3(b), the band structure for the minority-spin channel is\nshown. The semiconducting gap is indirect with the top of the valence band near the \u0393\npoint and the bottom of the conduction band at the zone corner R point. From the above,\nthen, it is clear that the carriers in the Mn/Si-DFH come from three majority-spin bands,\nand mediate the exchange interactions between the local magnetic moments which give rise\nto the ferromagnetic order in the Mn layer. The band structures given in Fig. 3 (a) and (b)\nexhibit clearly the marked two-dimensional half metallic character of the heterostructure.\nIn order to better characterize the relevant conduction states, we examine the Fermi\nsurfaces and associated charge density in Fig. 4. The band 1 forms a hole pocket, a surface\nwith closed orbit, around the \u0393 point. Bands 2 and 3 form two electron surfaces centered at\nthe R point in the kx -ky plane. In Fig. 4(b), as an example for illustration, the corresponding\nmajority-spin hole charge densities are obtained by integrating states in the vicinity of EF\nup to 0.5 eV. It can be seen that the hole states are strongly confined in the vicinity of the\nMn layer and distributed in the bonding directions between Mn and Si(I) atoms.\nOne important question is whether the half metallic character can be maintained up to\nTC in this DFH. Based on an analysis of available experimental data on NiMnSb alloys,\nHordequin et al. [23] identified the temperature T \u2217 (80 K) well below TC (730 K) at which\nNiMnSb undergoes an electronic phase transition from half metal to normal ferromagnet.\nThis crossover occurs because the minority bandgap is the result of exchange splitting of\nbands, which is proportional to the magnetization and decreases as temperature increase.\nThe interpretation is that one of the gap edges crosses the Fermi level as the gap decreases,\nthereby losing the half metal character. From Hall measurements, they found that the hole\nconcentration increases with temperature and that the low T \u2217 is the signature of spin flip\ntransitions from the majority-spin states at EF to the bottom of the conduction band of the\nminority-spin channel, which become allowed as the gap decreases. They concluded that\nT \u2217 could reach TC if EF lies near the top of the valence band of the minority-spin channel,\nrather than near the bottom of the conduction band. Unlike NiMnSb, this advantageous\nband lineup does occur in the band structure of Mn/Si-DFH shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3(c)\nshows a schematic diagram of density of states of Mn/Si-DFH near the EF . The spin-flip\ngap \u03b4 between the Fermi energy and the bottom of the conduction band in the minority-spin\nchannel is about 0.16 eV, which is close to the semiconducting gap \u2206 = 0.2 eV from the\n5\n\n\fvalence band maximum (VBM) to the bottom of the conduction band in the minority-spin\nchannel. In addition, the bottom of the conduction band is well below the conduction band\nminimum (CBM) of host Si crystal. At finite temperature, there are two possible spin-flip\ntransitions due to the interaction between the spin of a carrier and the fluctuation of local\nmoments of the Mn atoms. One is the transition from the top of valence states in the\nminority-spin channel to the majority states at EF , but this will be strongly suppressed\nby matrix element effects because the uppermost valence states are bulk Si bonding states\nwhereas the states at EF are Mn d - Si(I) p hybridized and they only weakly overlap bulk\nSi states. Thus, as in NiMnSb, only the second one dominates the spin-flip scattering and\ndeteriorates the half metallicity, because both the majority states at EF and the minority\nstates at the bottom of conduction band are coming from the hybridized Mn d - Si p states.\nThis second process, of an electron at the EF undergoing a spin flip transition to the bottom\nof conduction band, involve the so-called spin-flip gap \u03b4. It should be mentioned that the\nGGA usually underestimate the semiconducting gap of Si crystal, and a wider gap \u03b4 should\nbe more realistic. Therefore, for the Mn/Si-DFH, the half metallic character could persist\nup to a temperature comparable to TC .\nIn summary, using first-principles electronic-structure methods, we have designed a low\nstrain DFH composed of a Mn \u03b4-doped layer in Si substrate, which exhibits two-dimensional\nhalf metallic properties. The metallic states are hybrid states originating from Mn-t2g and\nnearest-neighbor Si-p states in the majority-spin channel. A semiconducting gap is retained\nbetween minority-spin bonding and antibonding states. From the DOS and band structure,\nthe half metallic properties are shown to have marked two-dimensional character and are\nlikely to persist up to T \u2217 \u2248 TC , in marked contrast to NiMnSb.\nSince the measured TC in dilutely doped Mn in bulk Si is approximately 400 K[17], the\nTC for this ordered DFH may be substantially higher than room temperature. Due to the\nmaturity of Si technologies, it may be expected that Si based devices will be more readily\nfabricated than their GaAs based counterparts. If the designed DFH can be grown, such Si\nbased half metallic materials could lead to a breakthrough in the realization of spintronic\ndevices in the near future, and to a new generation of devices in the years to come.\nThis work is partially supported by National Science Foundation with grant No. ESC0225007, and the San Diego Supercomputer Center.
