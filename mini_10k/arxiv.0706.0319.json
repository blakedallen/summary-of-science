Using GCH, we force the following: There are continuum many\nsimple cardinal characteristics with pairwise different values.\n\n1. Introduction\nThe union of countably many Lebesgue nullsets is again a nullset. On the other\nhand, there are 2\u05d00 many nullsets with non-null union. If we assume \u00acCH, i.e.\n2\u05d00 > \u05d01 , then it is interesting to ask about the minimal size of a family of nullsets\nwith non-null union. This is a cardinal number between (including) \u05d01 and 2\u05d00 .\nSuch cardinal numbers (or their definitions) are called cardinal characteristics.\nThere are numerous examples of such characteristics using notions from measure\ntheory, topology or combinatorics. If a and b are such characteristics, on can learn\nsomething about the underlying notions by either proving dependencies (e.g. a \u2264 b)\nin ZFC, or by showing that a and b are independent (usually by finding forcing\nnotions P and Q such that P forces a < b and Q forces b < a, or by using MA).\nBlass [1] introduced a classification of cardinal characteristics, and in particular\ndefined \u03a001 characteristics. Goldstern and Shelah [2] showed that there are many\n\u03a001 characteristics. In particular:\nAssume CH. Assume that \u03ba\u05d0\u01eb 0 = \u03ba\u01eb for all \u01eb \u2208 \u03c91 and that the\nfunctions f\u01eb , g\u01eb : \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c9 (\u01eb \u2208 \u03c91 ) are sufficiently different. Then\nthere is a partial order P preserving cardinals which forces that\nc\u2200 (f\u01eb , g\u01eb ) = \u03ba\u01eb for all \u01eb \u2208 \u03c91 .\n(The \u03a001 cardinal characteristics c\u2200 (f, g) are defined in 2.1.)\nIf the \u03ba\u01eb are pairwise different, then in the forcing extension the size of the\ncontinuum is at least \u05d0\u03c91 . So \u05d01 , the number of different characteristics in the\nforcing extension, is smaller than the continuum.\nIn this paper, we assume GCH in the ground model and modify the construction\nto get a universe satisfying:\nThere are continuum many pairwise different cardinal characteristics of the form c\u2200 (f\u01eb , g\u01eb ).\nWe give a relatively simple proof for this result. A slightly stronger result was\npromised in [2] to appear in a paper called 448a, which never materialized: a \"perfect set\" of pairwise different characteristics. Shelah and the author are working\non new creature forcing iteration techniques. One of the applications will hopefully be a proof of the perfect set result, as well as similar results for the dual\nDate: June 3, 2018.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 03E17;03E40.\nSupported by a European Union Marie Curie EIF fellowship, contract MEIF-CT-2006-024483.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nJAKOB KELLNER\n\nnotions c\u2203 (which require lim-inf constructions, cf. [3]). All these constructions are\nconsiderably more difficult than the ones in this paper.\n2. The theorem and the forcing\nDefinition 2.1. Let f, g : \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c9 \\ 1 be such that f (n) > g(n) for all n.\n\u2022 B : \u03c9 \u2192 P(\u03c9) is an (f, g)-slalom if B(n) \u2286 f (n) and |B(n)| < g(n) for all\nn \u2208 \u03c9.\nQ\n\u2022 A family B of (f, g)-slaloms \u2200-covers, if for all \u03bd \u2208 n\u2208\u03c9 f (n) there is a\nB \u2208 B such that \u03bd(n) \u2208 B(n) for all n \u2208 \u03c9.\n\u2022 c\u2200 (f, g) is the minimal size of a \u2200-covering family of (f, g)-slaloms.\nSee [2] for more about c\u2200 (f, g). We are going to prove the following:\nTheorem 2.2. Assume that CH holds, that \u03bc = \u03bc\u05d00 , and for \u01eb \u2208 \u03bc, \u03ba\u01eb < \u03bc is\na cardinal such that \u03ba\u05d0\u01eb 0 = \u03ba\u01eb . Then there is a forcing notion P and there are\nP -names f\u01eb , g\u01eb such that P preserves cardinals and forces the following: 2\u05d00 = \u03bc,\nand c\u2200 (f\u01eb , g\u01eb ) = \u03ba\u01eb for all \u01eb \u2208 \u03bc.\nIf we assume GCH, we can find such \u03bc and \u03ba\u01eb such that the \u03ba\u01eb are pairwise\ndifferent,1 i.e., we get continuum many pairwise different invariants in the extension.\nFor the rest of the paper we assume that the conditions of the theorem are\nsatisfied (in the ground model).\nWe will use \u01eb, \u01eb\u2032 , \u01eb1 , . . . for elements of \u03bc.\nAssumption 2.3. (gn,l )n\u2208\u03c9,0\u2264l<2n and (fn,l )n\u2208\u03c9,\u22121\u2264l<2n are sufficiently fast growing sequences of natural numbers, such that 0 = f0,\u22121 , fn+1,\u22121 = fn,2n \u22121 and\nfn,l\u22121 \u226a gn,l \u226a fn,l . We set fmax (m) = fm,2m \u22121 and gmin (m) = gm,0 .\nn*f\n\n(n\u22121)n\n\nmax\nSufficiently fast growing means the following:2 gn,l > 2 *fn,l\u22121\n, and fn,l >\nn+1\nn\ngn,l . (fmax (n \u2212 1) denotes the n-th power of fmax (n \u2212 1).)\nWe identify [0, 2n \u2212 1] with the set of binary sequences of length n, ordered\nlexicographically. So for s \u2208 2n , we can define fs = fn,s and gs = gn,s . If \u03b7 \u2208 2\u03c9 ,\nthen we can define f : \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c9 by f (n) = f\u03b7\u21ben , and g analogously.\nWe will define P so that P adds Sacks generics \u03b7\u01eb (\u01eb \u2208 \u03bc) and forces that\nc\u2200 (f\u01eb , g\u01eb ) = \u03ba\u01eb for the (f\u01eb , g\u01eb ) defined by \u03b7\u01eb .\nFix s \u2208 2n . If a is a subset of fs (i.e. of the interval [0, fs \u2212 1]), we set \u03bcs (a) =\nlngs (|a|). (Alternatively, We could use any other gs -big norm as well, i.e. a norm\nsatisfying the following:)\n\nLemma 2.4. \u03bcs : P(fs ) \u2192 R satisfies: (a, b \u2286 fs )\n\u2022 If b \u2286 a, then \u03bcs (a) \u2265 \u03bcs (b).\n\u2022 \u03bcs (fs ) \u2265 n.\n\u2022 \u03bcs ({t}) < 1 for all t \u2208 fs .\n\u2022 If F is a function from a to gs , then there is a b \u2286 a such that F \u21be b is\nconstant and \u03bcs (b) \u2265 \u03bcs (a) \u2212 1.\n1Let \u03bc = \u05d0 be the \u03c9 -th iterate of the function \u03b1 7\u2192 \u05d0 (taking the union at limits), and pick\n\u03bc\n\u03b1\n1\ncardinals \u03ba\u01eb < \u03bc with uncountable cofinality.\n2The second inequality guarantees that there is a g-big norm (cf. 2.4), and the first one is\nextracted from the proof of 4.3. Obviously one can try to find weaker conditions, but we do not\ntry to find optimal bounds in this paper.\n\n\fEVEN MORE SIMPLE CARDINAL INVARIANTS\n\n3\n\nNote that \u03bcS\ns (b) \u2265 2 implies that |b| > gs .\nSet \u03c9 \u2264n = l\u2264n \u03c9 l . We will use trees T \u2286 \u03c9 <\u03c9 (or 2<\u03c9 or \u03c9 \u2264n ). For a node\ns \u2208 T \u2229 \u03c9 n , n is called the height of s. A branch b in T is a maximal chain (i.e.\na maximal set of pairwise comparable nodes). We can identify b with an element\nof \u03c9 \u03c9 (or \u03c9 n ), and denote with b \u21be h the element of b of height h (for all h < \u03c9\nor h < n, respectively). A front F in T is a set of pairwise incomparable nodes\nsuch that every branch of T hits a node in F . When talking about nodes, we use\nthe terms \"comparable\" and \"compatible\" interchangeably. We use the symbol \u22a5\nfor incompatible (i.e. incomparable, when talking about nodes), and we use k for\ncompatible. A splitting node s is a node with at least two immediate successors.\nThe first splitting node is called stem(T ).\nA Sacks condition T is a perfect tree, i.e. T \u2286 2<\u03c9 is such that for every s \u2208 T\nthere is a splitting node s\u2032 > s. Equivalently, along every branch of T there are\ninfinitely many splitting nodes. So the set of the n-th splitting nodes forms a front.\nWe will use Sacks conditions as well as other \"lim-sup\" finite splitting tree forcings. Actually we will use finite approximations to such trees, but it might be\nuseful to first specify the objects we are approximating: For \u03b7 \u2208 2\u03c9 , T is an \u03b7-tree,\nif T \u2286 \u03c9 <\u03c9 is a tree without leaves (\"dead ends\") such that s(n) < f\u03b7\u21ben for all\ns \u2208 T . For an \u03b7-tree T and s \u2208 T \u2229 \u03c9 n , we set \u03bcT (s) = \u03bcs (A), where A is the set\nof immediate T -successors of s. T is fat if lim supn\u2192\u221e (\u03bcT (b \u21be n)) = \u221e for every\nbranch b of T . Q\u03b7 is the partial order of fat trees ordered by inclusion.3\nIt is easy to see (and analogous to Sacks forcing) that all forcing notions Q\u03b7 are\nand \u03c9 \u03c9 -bounding.4 In [2], Goldstern and Shelah picked \u03c91 many different \u03b7\u01eb , defined\nP\u01eb to be the countable support product of \u03ba\u01eb many copies of Q\u03b7\u01eb , and defined P to\nbe the countable support product of the P\u01eb . Then P forces c\u2200 (f\u01eb , g\u01eb ) = \u03ba\u01eb .\nWe need \u03bc > 2\u05d00 many different \u03b7, so \u03b7\u01eb will be a name (for a Sacks real). Then\nwe again want to use \u03ba\u01eb many copies of Q\u03b7\u01eb . Instead of using a composition of\nforcings, we more explicitly use finite approximations to fat trees:\nDefinition 2.5. Assume s \u2208 2n .\n\u2022 T is an s-tree if T \u2286 \u03c9 \u2264n+1 is a tree, every branch has length n + 1 and\nt(m) < fs\u21bem for each m \u2264 n and t \u2208 T \u2229 \u03c9 m+1 .\n\u2022 For m \u2264 n and t \u2208 T \u2229 \u03c9 m , t is an l-large splitting node, if \u03bcs\u21bem (A) \u2265 l for\nthe set A of immediate T -successors of t.\n\u2022 T has l-large splitting if the set of l-large splitting nodes forms a front.\nDefinition 2.6.\n\u2022 For every \u01eb in \u03bc, pick some\nS I\u01eb of size \u03ba\u01eb such that \u03bc and\nall the I\u01eb are pairwise disjoint. Set I = \u03bc \u222a \u01eb\u2208\u03bc I\u01eb .\n\u2022 We define \u03b5 : I \u2192 I: If \u03b1 \u2208 I\u01eb , then \u03b5(\u03b1) = \u01eb. If \u01eb \u2208 \u03bc, then \u03b5(\u01eb) = \u01eb.\nI will be the index set of the product forcing. We will use \u03b1, \u03b2, . . . for elements\nof I.\nDefinition 2.7. p \u2208 P consists of the following objects, satisfying the following\nproperties:\n3 Q is a special case of a lim-sup finite splitting tree forcing Q, informally defined as follows:\n\u03b7\nQ is defined by a finite splitting tree T0 and a norm on the successor sets.

Without\nloss of generality {dom(p) : p \u2208 A} forms a \u2206-system with root u \u2286 I. We\nfix enumerations {\u03b1p0 , \u03b1p1 , . . . } of dom(p) for all p \u2208 A.

Therefore P preserves all\ncardinals and forces 2\u05d00 = \u03bc.\nThe proof is straightforward, but the notation a bit cumbersome.\nDefinition 3.3.\n\u2022 pos(p, \u2264n) is the set of sequences a = (a(\u03b1))\u03b1\u2208dom(p) such\nthat a(\u03b1) \u2208 \u03c9 n+1 , a(\u03b1) \u2208 p(\u03b1) for \u03b1 \u2208 \u03bc, and a(\u03b1) \u2208 p(\u03b1, a(\u03b5(\u03b1))) otherwise.\n\u2022 For a \u2208 pos(p, \u2264n), p \u2227 a is the result of extending the stems in p to a.7\n\u2022 Let \u03c4 be a P -name. \u03c4 is (\u2264n)-decided by p, if for all a \u2208 pos(p, \u2264n), p \u2227 a\ndecides \u03c4 (i.e. there is some x \u2208 V such that p \u2227 a forces \u03c4 = x\u030c).\n\u2022 Assume q \u2264 p. pos(p, \u2264n) \u2261 pos(q, \u2264n) means that for all a \u2208 pos(p, \u2264n)\nthere is exactly one b \u2208 pos(q, \u2264n) such that a is b restricted to dom(p). In\nother words: On dom(p), p and q are identical up to height n + 1, and the\nstems of q outside of dom(p) have height at least n+1. If dom(q) = dom(p),\nthen pos(p, \u2264n) \u2261 pos(q, \u2264n) is equivalent to pos(p, \u2264n) = pos(q, \u2264n).\n\u2022 p \u2208 P is finitary if pos(p, \u2264n) is finite for all n \u2208 \u03c9.\nLemma 3.4. The set of finitary conditions is dense in P .\n(Enumerate dom(p) as (\u03b1i )i\u2208\u03c9 , and extend all stems at \u03b1i to height at least i.)\nThe set of finitary conditions is not open, but we get the following: If p \u2208 P is\nfinitary and q \u2264 p is such that dom(q) = dom(p), then q is finitary.\nWe now consider a strengthening of the property 2.7.4c of conditions in P :\nDefinition 3.5. p is uniform, if for all \u03b1 \u2208 I\u01eb and l \u2208 \u03c9 there is a h \u2208 \u03c9 such that\np(\u03b1, s) is l-large for all s \u2208 p(\u01eb) \u2229 \u03c9 h .\nFirst, we briefly comment on the connection between fronts and maximal antichains in Sacks conditions:8 Let T be a perfect tree. \"A is a front\" is stronger\nthan \"A is a maximal antichain\". In particular, it is possible that p \u2208 P is not\nuniform, e.g. that for \u03b1 \u2208 I\u01eb the set of nodes s \u2208 p(\u01eb) such that p(\u03b1, s) has 1large splitting contains a maximal antichain, but not a front. (For example, we can\nassume that p(\u01eb) = 2<\u03c9 , p(\u03b1, 0n ) has a trunk of length at least n + 1, but that\np(\u03b1, 0n \u2322 1) has 1-large splitting. So the nodes that guarantee 1-large splitting contain the maximal antichain {1, 01, 001, . . . }, but no front.) However, if A1 , A2 , . . .\nare maximal antichains in T , we can find a perfect tree T \u2032 \u2286 T such that Ai \u2229 T \u2032\nis a front in T \u2032 . (Construct finite approximations Ti to T \u2032 : For every leaf s \u2208 Ti\u22121 ,\nextend s to some s\u2032 above some element of Ai and further to some splitting node\ns\u2032\u2032 . Let Ti contain the successors of all these splitting nodes.)\nThis implies that the uniform conditions are dense:\nLemma 3.6. Assume p \u2208 P . Then there is a uniform q \u2264 p such that dom(q) =\ndom(p).\n7 More formally: [p \u2227 a](\u01eb) is {s \u2208 p(\u01eb) : s k a(\u01eb)} for \u01eb \u2208 \u03bc, and\n[p \u2227 a](\u03b1, s) is {t \u2208 p(\u03b1, s) : t k a(\u03b1)} for \u03b1 \u2208 I\u01eb . p \u2227 a is again a condition in P .\n8Of course, the same applies to all lim-sup finite splitting tree forcings.\n\n\f6\n\nJAKOB KELLNER\n\nProof.

For i, l \u2208 \u03c9 and s \u2208 p(\u01eb)\nand there is an s\u2032 > s such that p(\u03b1i , s\u2032 ) has l-large splitting. This gives (open)\ndense sets Di,l \u2286 p(\u01eb). Choose maximal antichains Ai,l \u2286 Di,l . Then there is a\nperfect tree q(\u01eb) \u2286 p(\u01eb) such that Ai,l \u2229 q is a front in q for all i, l \u2208 \u03c9.\n\u0003\nWe can also fix p up to some height h and do the construction starting with h.\nThen we get:\nLemma 3.7. Assume that p \u2208 P , h \u2208 \u03c9 and that pos(p, \u2264h) is finite. Then there is\na finitary, uniform q \u2264 p such that dom(p) = dom(q) and pos(p, \u2264h) = pos(q, \u2264h).\nUsing this notation, we can finally prove continuous reading of names:\nProof of Lemma 3.2. Pure decision: Fix p \u2208 P finitary, h \u2208 \u03c9 and a P -name \u03c4\nfor an ordinal. We can find a finitary, uniform q \u2264 p which (\u2264h)-decides \u03c4 , such\nthat pos(p, \u2264h) \u2261 pos(q, \u2264h).\nProof: Enumerate pos(p, \u2264h) as a0 , . . . , al\u22121 . We just strengthen each p \u2227 ai\nto decide \u03c4 and glue back together the resulting conditions. More formally: Set\np0 = p. Let 0 \u2264 i < l. We assume that we have constructed pi \u2264 p such that\npos(pi , \u2264h) \u2261 pos(p, \u2264h). Let b \u2208 pos(pi , \u2264h) correspond to ai \u2208 pos(p, \u2264h), and\nfind a finitary p\u2032 \u2264 pi \u2227 b deciding \u03c4 , so that the length of all stems are at least\nh + 1. Define pi+1 the following way: dom(pi+1 ) = dom(p\u2032 ).\n\u2022 If \u03b1 \u2208 dom(p\u2032 ) \\ dom(pi ), then pi+1 (\u03b1) = p\u2032 (\u03b1).\n\u2022 If \u01eb \u2208 dom(pi ) \u2229 \u03bc, then pi+1 (\u01eb) = p\u2032 (\u01eb) \u222a {s \u2208 pi : s \u22a5 b(\u01eb)}.\n\u2022 Assume that \u03b1 \u2208 dom(pi ) \u2229 I\u01eb . If s \u2208 pi (\u01eb) \\ p\u2032 (\u01eb), or if s \u2208 p\u2032 (\u01eb) is\nincompatible with b(\u01eb), then pi+1 (\u03b1, s) = pi (\u03b1, s). Otherwise, pi+1 (\u03b1, s) =\np\u2032 (\u03b1, s) \u222a {t \u2208 pi (\u03b1, s) : t \u22a5 b(\u03b1)}.\nNote that pi+1 \u2264 pi , pos(pi+1 , \u2264h) \u2261 pos(pi , \u2264h) and pi+1 \u2227 b = p\u2032 . Let q \u2264 pl be\nfinitary and uniform such that pos(q, \u2264h) \u2261 pos(pl , \u2264h). Then q \u2264 p, pos(q, \u2264h) \u2261\npos(p, \u2264h) and q \u2227 b decides \u03c4 for each b \u2208 pos(q, \u2264h).\nFusion: Assume the following:\n\u2022 p0 \u2265 p1 \u2265 . . . is a sequence of finitary, uniform conditions in P .\n\u2022 h0 , h1 , . . . is an increasing sequence of natural numbers.\n\u2022 pos(pn+1 , \u2264hn ) \u2261 pos(pn , \u2264hn ).\nS\n\u2022 un \u2286 dom(pn ) is finite and \u03b5-closed for n \u2208 \u03c9.

On the other\nhand, the \u03b7\u01eb are forced to be pairwise different.\n\u0003\nLemma 3.8. P forces that \u03ba\u01eb \u2264 c\u2200 (f\u01eb , g\u01eb ).\nProof. Assume the following towards a contradiction: \u05d01 \u2264 \u03bb < \u03ba\u01eb , Bi (i \u2208 \u03bb) are\nP -names, and p forces that {Bi : i \u2208 \u03bb} is a covering family of (f\u01eb , g\u01eb )-slaloms.\nFor every Bi , find a maximal\nantichain Ai of conditions that read Bi continuously.\nS\nBecause of \u05d02 -cc, X = i\u2208\u03bb,a\u2208Ai dom(a) has size \u03bb < \u03ba\u01eb , so there is an \u03b1 \u2208 I\u01eb \\ X.\nFind a q \u2264 p and an i \u2208 \u03bb such that q forces that \u03b7\u03b1 (n) \u2208 Bi (n) for all n. Without\nloss of generality, q is uniform and stronger than some a \u2208 Ai , i.e. q \u21be dom(q) \\ {\u03b1}\ncontinuously reads Bi . (And q \u21be {\u01eb} continuously reads \u03b7\u01eb \u21be n and therefore g\u01eb (n).)\nPick some h big enough such that q(\u03b1, s) has 2-large splitting for all s \u2208 q(\u01eb)\u2229\u03c9 h .\nIncrease the stems of q(\u03b2) for \u03b2 \u2208 dom(q) \\ {\u03b1} to some height h\u2032 > h to decide\ng\u01eb \u21be h + 1 as well as Bi \u21be h + 1. So the resulting condition r decides for all m \u2264 h\nthe values of Bi (m) and g\u01eb (m). B is the name of an (f\u01eb , g\u01eb )-slalom, and therefore\n|Bi (m)| < g\u01eb (m). Also, r(\u03b1, \u03b7\u01eb \u21be h) has a 2-large splitting node at some m \u2264 h. But\nthat implies that there are more than g\u01eb (m) many possibilities for \u03b7\u01eb (m).

P\u01eb is a complete subforcing of P , and also has continuous reading of\nnames. In particular, P\u01eb forces 2\u05d00 = \u03ba\u01eb .\nProof. Continuous reading is analogous to the case of P . To see that P\u01eb is a\ncomplete subforcing, it is enough to show that for all p \u2208 P there is a reduction\np\u2032 \u2208 P\u01eb (i.e. for all q \u2264 p\u2032 in P\u01eb , q and p are compatible in P ).

If \u01eb \u2208 dom(p), then r is a\ncondition in P (and stronger than q, p). Otherwise, it could happen that stem(q, \u01eb)\nis compatible with stem(p, \u01eb\u2032 ) for some \u01eb\u2032 \u2208 \u03bc. We can assume without loss of\ngenerality that stem(q, \u01eb) \u2287 stem(p, \u01eb\u2032 ). Increase the stems of both q(\u01eb) and p(\u01eb\u2032 )\nto be incompatible.

P forces that the (f\u01eb , g\u01eb )-slaloms in V [GP\u01eb ] form a cover, in particular\nthat c\u2200 (f\u01eb , g\u01eb ) \u2264 \u03ba\u01eb .\n\n\f8\n\nJAKOB KELLNER\n\nFor the proof, we need more notation:\nLet q \u2208 P .\n\u2022 For \u01eb \u2208 \u03bc, n is a splitting level of q(\u01eb) if there is some splitting node\ns \u2208 q(\u01eb) \u2229 \u03c9 n . n is a unique splitting level if there is exactly one such s.\n\u2022 Let \u03b1 \u2208 I\u01eb . n is a splitting level of q(\u03b1) if there is some s \u2208 q(\u01eb) \u2229 \u03c9 n such\nthat some t \u2208 q(\u03b1, s) \u2229 \u03c9 n is a splitting node. n is a unique splitting level\nof q(\u03b1) if there is exactly one such s, and if moreover for this s there is\nexactly one t as well.\n\u2022 q has unique splitting below h if for all n < h there is at most one \u03b1 \u2208 I\nsuch that n is splitting level of q(\u03b1), and in this case n is a unique splitting\nlevel of q(\u03b1).\nq has unique splitting if q has unique splitting below all h.\n\u2022 If q has unique splitting below h, we enumerate (in increasing order) the\nsplitting levels below h (for any \u03b1) by (msplit\n)i\u2208l and the corresponding \u03b1\ni\n)\n.\nIf\nq\nhas\nunique\nsplitting,\nwe\nget\nthe corresponding infinite\nby (\u03b1split\ni\u2208l\ni\nsequences.10\n\u2208\n/ \u03bc,\n\u2022 q has unique, large splitting if it has unique splitting and if for \u03b1split\ni\nsplit\nthe splitting node t of height mi\nis i-large.\nQ\n\u2022 Let \u03bd be a P -name for a sequence in n\u2208\u03c9 fmax (n). q rapidly reads \u03bd below\nh if:\n\u2013 q has unique, large splitting below h.\n\u2013 If \u03b1 \u2208 I\u01eb , then all splits at \u03b1 are higher than some split at \u01eb, i.e.: If\n\u03b1split\n= \u03b1, then \u03b1split\n= \u01eb for some j < i.\ni\nj\nsplit\nsplit\nis (\u2264mi )-decided by q.\n\u2013 \u03bd \u21be mi\n\u22121)-decided.11\nis even (\u2264msplit\n\u2208\n/\n\u03bc, then \u03bd \u21be msplit\n\u2013 If \u03b1split\ni\ni\ni\nq rapidly reads \u03bd if this is the case below all h.\nIf q has unique splitting, then q is finitary.\nLemma 4.4. Assume that p \u2208 P and that \u03bd is a P -name for a sequence in\nQ\nn\u2208\u03c9 fmax (n). Then there is a q \u2264 p rapidly reading \u03bd.\nProof. We use the following notion of unique extension: Fix p \u2208 P finitary, m \u2208 \u03c9,\nand a splitting node s (or (s, t)) in p of height h > m.12 Then we can extend p\nuniquely above m up to s (or s, t), i.e. there is a r satisfying:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nr \u2264 p, dom(r) = dom(p).\npos(r, \u2264m) = pos(p, \u2264m).\nIf m < n < h, then n is not a splitting level of r.\nh is a unique splitting level of r.\nIf a \u2208 pos(p, \u2264h) extends s (or s, t), then a \u2208 pos(r, \u2264h).\n\nIn other words, we eliminate all splits between m and h, and at h we leave only the\nsplit s (or t) with all its successors.\n10In this case, each each \u03b1 \u2208 dom(q) will appear infinitely often in the sequence (\u03b1split )\ni\u2208\u03c9 ,\ni\n\nto allow for sufficiently large splitting.\n11And therefore (\u2264msplit )-decided, since every \u03b7 \u2208 pos(q, \u2264msplit ) extend uniquely to an\ni\u22121\ni\u22121\n\u03b7\u2032 \u2208 pos(q, \u2264msplit\n\u2212 1).\ni\n12This means: Either \u01eb \u2208 \u03bc and s \u2208 p(\u01eb) is a splitting node, or \u03b1 \u2208 I , s \u2208 p(\u01eb) and t \u2208 p(\u03b1, s)\n\u01eb\nis a splitting node.\n\n\fEVEN MORE SIMPLE CARDINAL INVARIANTS\n\n9\n\nWe use this fact to define an increasing sequence (pi )i\u2208\u03c9 and show that the limit\nq has the desired properties.\nsplit\nand\nSet p\u22121 = p and msplit\n\u22121 = \u22121. Assume we already have pi as well as mj\nsplit\nsplit\n\u03b1j\nfor all j \u2264 i, such that pi rapidly reads \u03bd below mi + 1. For the final limit,\nwe will keep all elements of pos(pi , \u2264msplit\n+ 1).\ni\nsplit\nWe use some bookkeeping to choose \u03b1 \u2208 dom(pi ) and s \u2208 pi (\u03b5(\u03b1)) \u2229 \u03c9 mi +1 .\nIf \u03b1 \u2208 \u03bc, we pick some splitting node s\u2032 > s in pi (\u03b1). Otherwise we again use the\nsplit\nbookkeeping to choose t \u2208 pi (\u03b1, s) \u2229 \u03c9 mi +1 , and pick some s\u2032 > s in pi (\u03b5(\u03b1)) and\nan i + 2-big splitting node t\u2032 > t in pi (\u03b1, s\u2032 ). Let h be the height of the splitting\nnode s\u2032 (or t\u2032 ). We extend pi uniquely above msplit\nto s\u2032 (or s\u2032 , t\u2032 ). Call the result\ni\nsplit\nr. Set mi+1 = h. Then, using pure decision, we can find some p\u2032 \u2264 r which is\n(\u2264h)-deciding \u03bd \u21be h so that pos(p\u2032 , \u2264h) \u2261 pos(r, \u2264h) and the stems of p\u2032 outside of\ndom(r) are higher than h.\nIf \u03b1 \u2208 \u03bc, set pi+1 = p\u2032 . Otherwise, let A be the set of successors of t\u2032 . There are\nless than fmax (h \u2212 1)h many possibilities for \u03bd \u21be h, and at most h many splitting\nnodes below h, each with at most fmax (h\u22121) many successors. This gives a function\nfmax (h \u2212 1)h \u00d7 A \u2192 fmax (h \u2212 1)h\nor\n\nh\n\nA \u2192 fmax (h \u2212 1)h*fmax (h\u22121) < gmin (h).\nSo we can use bigness to thin out A to some homogeneous B that has norm at least\ni + 1. Call the result pi+1 . In this case. pi+1 already (\u2264h\u22121)-decides \u03bd \u21be h.\nLet q be the limit of (pi )i\u2208\u03c9 . We have to show that q \u2208 P . It is enough to\nrequire from the bookkeeping that the following is satisfied:\n\u2022 For all \u01eb \u2208 dom(q) \u2229 \u03bc, and s0 \u2208 q(\u01eb), there is an s > s0 such that the\nbookkeeping chooses \u01eb, s at some stage.\n\u2022 For all \u03b1 \u2208 dom(q) \u2229 I\u01eb , for all s0 \u2208 q(\u01eb), and for all t0 \u2208 q(\u03b1, s0 ), there are\ns > s0 and t > t0 such that \u03b1, s, t are chosen at some stage.\n\u2022 For all \u03b1 \u2208 dom(q) \u2229 I\u01eb , \u01eb is chosen (for the first time) before \u03b1 is chosen.\n(It is easy to find a bookkeeping meeting these requirements.) Then q is indeed in\nP : Assume that \u03b1 \u2208 dom(q)\u2229I\u01eb , s0 \u2208 q(\u01eb), and l \u2208 \u03c9. We have to show that q(\u03b1, s)\nis l-large for for some s > s0 . First extend s to some s\u2032 of height at least msplit\nl\n(defined from q). Enumerate the leaves in q(\u03b1, s\u2032 ) as t0 , t1 , . . . , tk\u22121 . Increase s\u2032 to\ns\u20320 such that in q(\u03b1, s\u20320 ) there is a splitting node above t0 . Repeat that for the other\nti and set s = s\u2032k\u22121 . If b is a branch through q(\u03b1, s), then there has to be some\nsplit in b above msplit\n, but each splitting node in q of this height is l-large.\n\u0003\nl\nsplit\nSo we get: If \u03b1split\n/ \u03bc, then \u03bd \u21be msplit\n), is (\u2264msplit\n)i+1 \u2208\ni+1 , and in particular \u03bd(mi\ni\nsplit\ndecided. Otherwise, it is (\u2264mi )-decided only modulo the two possibilities left\nand right for the successor at the split at height msplit\ni+1 in the Sacks condition\nq(\u03b1split\n).\nSo\nin\nboth\ncases,\nand\nfor\nall\nn,\nwe\ncan\ncalculate\n\u03bd(n) from 2 \u00d7 pos(q, \u2264n).\ni+1\nWe can write this as a function:\n\nG : 2 \u00d7 pos(q, \u2264n) \u2192 fmax (n).\n\nQ\nProof of Lemma 4.3. Fix p \u2208 P and a P -name \u03bd for a function in n\u2208\u03c9 f\u01eb (n).\nWe have to find q \u2264 p and a P\u01eb -name B of an (f\u01eb , g\u01eb )-slalom such that q forces\n\u03bd(n) \u2208 B(n) for all n \u2208 \u03c9.\n\n\f10\n\nJAKOB KELLNER\n\nLet r \u2264 p rapidly read \u03bd. We can assume that \u01eb \u2208 dom(r). We can also assume\nthat the i-th splitting node is even (i + 1)-large and not just i-large.13 We will\ndefine, by induction on n, B(n) as well as q \u2264 r up to height \u2264n.\nq will be the result of thinning out some of the splitting nodes in r (in the nonSacks part), in a such way that the norm of the node will be decreased by at most\n1. So q will again have unique, large splitting, and q will be a condition in P .\nIf we already constructed q below n, and if there is no split at height n, we have\nno choice for q at height n but just take the unique extension given by r. If there\nis a split, we may thin out the successor set (reducing the norm by at most 1). Of\ncourse, this way we will loose former splits at higher levels (which extended the\nsuccessors we just left out). So the splitting levels of q will be a proper subset of\ndenote the splits of q.\nthe splitting levels of r. In the following, msplit\nand \u03b1split\ni\ni\n\u2032\nIf \u01eb 6= \u01eb, \u03b1 \u2208 dom(r) \u2229 I\u01eb\u2032 , and h is a splitting level of r(\u03b1), then there is some\nsplitting level h\u2032 < h of r(\u01eb\u2032 ). Also, trunk(r, \u01eb) and trunk(r, \u01eb\u2032 ) are incompatible,\ni.e. they differ below h. By the way we construct q, we get the same for q:\n(\u2217) If \u03b1 \u2208 I\u01eb\u2032 , \u01eb\u2032 6= \u01eb, and if h is a splitting level of q(\u03b1), then either\nall s \u2208 q(\u01eb) \u2229 2h are lexicographically smaller than all t \u2208 q(\u01eb\u2032 ) \u2229 2h ,\nor the other way round.\nWe now define q at height n and B(n): Assume that i is maximal such that\nm = msplit\n\u2264 n. Set \u03b1 = \u03b1split\n. By rapid reading there is a function G with\ni\ni\ndomain 2 \u00d7 pos(r, \u2264m) that calculates \u03bd(n). Let A be the set of successors of the\nsplit of level m. pos(r, \u2264m \u2212 1) has size at most fmax (m \u2212 1)m . So we can write G\nas\nG : 2 \u00d7 fmax (m \u2212 1)m \u00d7 A \u2192 f\u01eb (n).\nCase A: n > m.\nThere are no splits on level n, so for q at level n we use the unique extensions given\nby r.\nThe size of A is at most fmax (m), so the domain of G has at most size\n2 * fmax (m \u2212 1)m * fmax (m) < gmin (n),\nand therefore is smaller than g\u01eb (n). So we can put all possible values for \u03bd(n) into\nB(n).\nCase B: n = m, \u03b1 \u2208 {\u01eb} \u222a I\u01eb .\nq at level n contains all the successors of the split at level n.\nIn the P\u01eb -extension, we know which successor we choose.14 Given this knowledge,\nthe domain of G is again smaller than gmin(m), just as in Case A.\nCase C: n = m, \u03b1 \u2208 \u03bc \\ {\u01eb}.\nq at level n contains both successors of the split at level n.\n|A| = 2, so there are again only\n2 * fmax (n \u2212 1)n * 2 < gmin(n)\nmany possible values for \u03bd(n).\nCase D: Otherwise n = m, \u03b1 \u2208 I\u01eb\u2032 , \u01eb\u2032 6= \u01eb.\nSo for an s \u2208 r(\u01eb\u2032 )\u2229\u03c9 n there is a splitting node t \u2208 r(\u03b1, s) of height n with successor\n13It is clear we can get this looking at the proof of rapid reading, or we can get first a \"standard\"\nrapid reading r and then just remove the very first split by enlarging the trunk.\n14If any. Of course the filter could be incompatible with s (or s, t).\n\n\fEVEN MORE SIMPLE CARDINAL INVARIANTS\n\n11\n\nset A. As stated in (\u2217) above, s is (lexicographically) either smaller or larger than\nall the nodes in r(\u01eb) \u2229 \u03c9 n .\nSubcase D1: s is smaller.\nWe keep all the successors of the split at level n.\n|A| \u2264 fs , and g\u01eb (n) = g\u03b7\u01eb \u21ben has to be some gn,k for k > s (in [0, 2n \u2212 1]).
