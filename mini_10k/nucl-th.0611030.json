For example, the\nobserved maximum mass of cold neutron stars cannot be explained without\nconsidering the pressure, arising from the strong nuclear force, which opposes\ngravitational collapse. It follows that strongly interacting matter is one of the\nfundamental systems that we have to study in order to understand stellar\nphenomena as well as the properties of finite nuclei.\nThe properties of stellar matter are strongly density dependent. The theoretical framework for describing the properties of strongly interacting matter\nis the Equation of State (EoS), which relates the pressure and total energy\ndensity of the system. These quantities are derived from the density dependence of the energy per particle of the system, calculated using a model for\nthe baryon-baryon interaction between particles present in the matter. There\nis a large variety of EoS available in the literature (see e.g. [1,2,3,4]), based\non very different assumptions concerning the nature of the interactions governing the stellar matter. Ways of constraining the available EoS are being\nactively sought (see e.g. [4,5,6,7,8]) but no unambiguous findings have been\nreported as yet. The study of the properties of high density matter and of cold\nneutron stars provides an attractive laboratory for seeking such a constraint.\nHowever, the fundamental question arises as to the limit of applicability of\nany of the existing EoS at densities as high as 6 \u00f7 10 n0 , required, for example,\nfor calculating the maximum mass of neutron star models.\nAt sufficiently high density, nuclear matter will most likely be composed\nnot just of nucleons and leptons but also strange baryons and boson condensates [9,10,11,12]. More importantly, it is unlikely that these particles\n\u2217 corresponding author: pierre.guichon@cea.fr\n\n2\n\n\fwill maintain their identity as confined entities of quarks, but the interaction between overlapping quark bags will result in partial or full deconfinement [13,14]. Therefore a realistic high density EoS should contain all this\nphysics. Numerical extrapolation of a nucleon-only EoS to high densities, although it may appear to work (mechanically), is dangerous and may obscure\nsome important effects. This is true even at lower densities, in the region\naround twice nuclear saturation density, as some models predict low threshold\ndensities for the creation of hyperons in beta equilibrium. The investigation of\nthis effect on non-equilibrium matter is expected to be crucial for modelling\ncore-collapse supernovae, as the density at bounce after the original collapse\nis around 2 \u00f7 2.5 n0 and the presence of hyperons will soften the EoS, thus\nassisting the explosion.\nThe relativistic formulation of the QMC model [15,16] offers a unique opportunity to self-consistently probe the composition of high density matter. In\nthis work, the matter which is investigated is taken to be in \u03b2-equilibrium,\nincluding the full baryon octet as well as electrons and muons. The density\nand temperature dependent thresholds and production rates of hyperons in\nnon-equilibrium stellar matter, relevant for core-collapse supernova physics,\nwill be the subject of a forthcoming publication.\nThe general QMC model is briefly described in Section 2, followed by a description of its application to uniform nuclear matter at zero temperature and\nin \u03b2-equilibrium (Section 3). The basic features of cold, slowly rotating neutron stars are given in Section 4. Details of QMC neutron star models and\nsome comparison with observational data and other model calculations are\ngiven in Section 5, with a summary of our main conclusions in Section 6.\n\n2\n\nQMC model\n\n2.1 The physics of the model\n\nThe formulation of the QMC model [17] which we use in this work has been\npresented in a previous paper [16]. There it was shown that it is possible to\nbuild a nuclear Hamiltonian which is consistent with relativity and which can\nbe used at high density. The predictions of this model, which represents a\nsignificant improvement over earlier work [15], because the need to expand\nabout < \u03c3 >= 0 was removed, have been sucessfully confronted with the\nphenomenology of finite nuclei. In this section we rely on the results of Ref. [16]\nand generalize the formalism to nuclear matter containing an arbitrary mixture\nof the octet members, N, \u039b, \u03a3, \u039e.\n3\n\n\fWe recall that, in the QMC model, the nuclear system is represented as a collection of quark bags. These bags may contain strange as well as non strange\nquarks, so the framework is well adapted to describing any kind of baryon.\nThe crucial hypothesis is that in nuclear matter the baryons retain their individuality, or more precisely, they remain the pertinent degrees of freedom\n(or quasi-particles) even in dense nuclear matter. From this point of view the\nusual statement that the bags should not overlap is clearly too restrictive. It\ngives too much weight to the description of the internal structure within the\nbag model, while the latter is in fact used only to infer the interactions between the quasi-particles. In this respect, we point out that the bag model is\nan effective realisation of confinement, which must not be taken too literally.\nThe QCD lattice simulations of Bissey et al. [18] indicate that the true confinement picture is closer to a Y-shaped color string attached to the quarks.\nOutside this relatively thin string one has the ordinary, non-perturbative vacuum, where the quarks from other hadrons can pass without disturbing the\nstructure very much. So, even though the bag model imposes a strict condition,\nwhich prevents the quarks from travelling through its boundary, this must be\nseen as the average representation of a more complex situation and one should\nnot attribute a deep physical meaning to the surface of the cavity nor to its\nsize. In particular, estimating the density at which the QMC approximation\nbreaks down as the reciprocal of the bag volume is certainly too pessimistic.\nOf course, there is a density above which the QMC model becomes inadequate\nbut in this work we assume that this critical density is large enough that we\ncan use the model to predict the properties of neutron stars.\nThe salient feature of the QMC model is that the interactions are generated by\nthe exchange of mesons coupled locally to the quarks. In a literal interpretation\nof the bag model, where only quarks and gluons can live inside the cavity, this\ncoupling would be unnatural. Again, we must return to the more realistic\nunderlying picture where the quarks are attached to a string but otherwise\nmove in the non-perturbative QCD vacuum. There, nothing prevents them\nfrom feeling the vacuum fluctuations, which we describe by meson fields. As\nbefore we limit our considerations to the \u03c3, \u03c9 and \u03c1 mesons. We also estimate,\nin a simplified manner, the effect of single pion exchange. At this point it is\nuseful to recall that the \u03c3 meson used here is not the chiral partner of the pion.\nIt is a chiral invariant scalar field, which mocks up the correlated multi-pion\nexchanges in the scalar-isoscalar channel.\n\n2.2 Effective mass and energy of a bag in the nuclear medium\n\nIn Ref. [19] we used the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) approximation to derive\nthe energy of a quark bag coupled to the nuclear mean fields associated with\nthe \u03c3, \u03c9 and \u03c1 mesons. Given the position and velocity of a bag, we obtained\n4\n\n\fp\n\nn\n\n\u039b\n\n\u03a3\u2212\n\n\u03a30\n\n\u03a3+\n\n\u039e\u2212\n\n\u039e0\n\nt\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n2\n\n0\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n2\n\nm\n\n1\n2\n\n\u2212 21\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n\u2212 12\n\n1\n2\n\ns\n\n0\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n-1\n\n-1\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\n-2\n\nTable 1\nQuantum numbers of the octet members.\n\nits energy by solving the field equations for the confined quarks. As the BO\napproximation requires that both position and velocity are known, this energy\nis of course classical and canonical quantization is performed after the full\nHamiltonian has been built. As our previous work was limited to nuclear\nmatter and finite nuclei built primarily of nucleons, we now generalize our\nresults to include hyperons. Here we limit our considerations to the spin 1/2\nSU(3) octet (N, \u039b, \u03a3, \u039e) and therefore a baryon can be specified by |f >=\n|tms >, with t, m the isospin and its projection and s the strangeness \u2013 see\nTable 1. Our working hypothesis is that the strange quark is not coupled to the\nmeson fields, which can be seen as a consequence of the fact that the mesons\nrepresent correlated pion exchanges. This is also the natural explanation for\nthe small spin-orbit splitting observed in \u039b hypernuclei, given that all the \u039b\nspin is carried by the strange quark. We set the u and d quark masses to zero\nand assume that their coupling to the meson fields respects isospin symmetry.\n~ and momentum P~\nThen the energy of a baryon of flavour f with position R\nhas the form 1\nE=\n\nq\n\nP 2 + Mf (\u03c3)2 + g\u03c9f \u03c9 + g\u03c1~b.I~t\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Mf (\u03c3) is the effective mass, that is the energy of the corresponding\nquark bag in its rest frame, in the \u03c3 field, and I~t is the isospin operator for\nisospin t, defined as\n< tms|\n\nX\nq\n\n\u03c4~q \u2032 \u2032 \u2032\nt\n|t m s >= \u03b4(tt\u2032 )\u03b4(ss\u2032 )I~mm\n\u2032\n2\n\n(2)\n\nwith ~\u03c4q the Pauli matrix acting on the u and d quarks. Apart from the \u03c1\ncoupling, for which we denote the field b\u03b1 , with \u03b1 = (\u22121, 0, 1) the isospin\nindex, the energy is diagonal in flavour space. Note that the flavour dependence\nof the \u03c1 coupling is entirely contained in I~t . In Eq. (1) the meson fields are\n~ the center of the bag 2 and, in comparison with Ref. [16],\nevaluated at ~r = R,\nwe have dropped the spin-orbit interaction \u2013 since in the following we shall\n1\n\nWe use the system of units such that \u0127 = c = 1.\nThe variation of the field over the confinement cavity generates the spin-orbit\ninteraction, as derived in Ref. [16].\n2\n\n5\n\n\fconsider only the case of uniform matter. The flavour dependence of the \u03c9\ncoupling is fixed by the number of non-strange quarks in the baryon, that is:\ns\ng\u03c9f = wf\u03c9 g\u03c9 = (1 + )g\u03c9\n3\n\n(3)\n\nwith g\u03c9 the \u03c9 \u2212 N coupling constant. As shown in the Appendix, the effective\nmass is well approximated by a quadratic expansion\nd\nMf (\u03c3) = Mf \u2212 wf\u03c3 g\u03c3 \u03c3 + w\u0303f\u03c3 (g\u03c3 \u03c3)2\n2\n\n(4)\n\nwhere g\u03c3 is the free \u03c3 \u2212 N coupling constant. The scalar polarisability, d, describes the response of the nucleon to the applied scalar field. It is at the origin\nof the many-body forces in the QMC model. The corresponding scalar polarisability for baryon f is dw\u0303f\u03c3 (wf\u03c3 )\u22122 . The weights wf\u03c3 , w\u0303f\u03c3 control the flavour\ndependence and in first approximation wf\u03c3 \u2243 w\u0303f\u03c3 \u2243 1 + s/3. The hyperfine\ncolor interaction breaks this relation and the exact values, which depend on\nf ree\nthe free nucleon radius, RN\n, are given in the Appendix.\n\n2.3 Hamiltonian\n\nThe total energy of the nuclear system is the sum of the baryon energies (1)\nand of the energy stored in the meson fields:\nEtot =\n\nX\n\nE(i) + Emesons\n\ni=1,A\n\n1\nEmesons =\n2\n\nZ\n\n1\n\u2212\n2\n\nh\n\nd~r (\u2207\u03c3)2 + m2\u03c3 \u03c3 2\nZ\n\nh\n\n2\n\nd~r (\u2207\u03c9) +\n\ni\n\nm2\u03c9 \u03c9 2\n\ni\n\n1\n\u2212\n2\n\nZ\n\nd~r\n\n\u0014\u0010\n\n\u2207~b\n\n\u00112\n\n+\n\nm2\u03c1~b2\n\n\u0015\n\n(5)\n\nwith m\u03c3 , m\u03c9 , m\u03c1 the meson masses. As usual, we consider only the time component of the vector fields. By hypothesis, the meson fields are time independent.\nTherefore the classical Hamiltonian of the nuclear system is simply\nH(Ri , Pi ) = Etot (Ri , Pi , \u03c3 \u2192 \u03c3sol , \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c9sol , ~b \u2192 ~bsol )\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u03c3sol , \u03c9sol , ~bsol are the the solutions of the meson equations of motion:\n\u03b4E\n\u03b4E\n\u03b4E\n=\n=\n= 0.\n\u03b4\u03c3\n\u03b4\u03c9\n\u03b4b\u03b1\n\n(7)\n\n6\n\n\fThe equations for the \u03c9, ~b fields, which are linear, present no difficulty. By\ncontrast, the \u03c3 field equation is highly non-linear, because of the scalar polarisability term in the effective mass. In Ref. [16], we proposed to solve it\napproximately by writing:\n\u03c3 = \u03c3\u0304 + \u03b4\u03c3,\n\n\u03c3\u0304 =< \u03c3 >\n\n(8)\n\nwhere, < * * * >, denotes the nuclear ground state expectation value, and we\nconsidered the deviation, \u03b4\u03c3, as a small quantity. We refer to Ref. [16] for the\ndetails of the derivation and here we simply recall the results. The piece of\nthe Hamiltonian which depends on \u03c3 may be written:\nH\u03c3 =\n\nZ\n\n\"\n\n1\n\u2202K\n1\n\u2202K\n\u2202K\nd~r K(\u03c3\u0304) \u2212 \u03c3\u0304 <\n> + \u03b4\u03c3\n\u2212<\n>\n2\n\u2202 \u03c3\u0304\n2\n\u2202 \u03c3\u0304\n\u2202 \u03c3\u0304\n\n!#\n\n(9)\n\nwhere normal ordering is implicit. The one body kinetic energy operator, K(\u03c3\u0304),\nis defined as (V is the normalization volume):\nK(\u03c3\u0304) =\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\nq\n1 X i(~k\u2212~k\u2032 ).~r q 2\nk + Mf [\u03c3\u0304(~r)]2 + k \u20322 + Mf [\u03c3\u0304(~r)]2 a~\u2020kf a~k\u2032 f (10)\ne\n2V ~ ~ \u2032\nk,k ,f\n\nwith a~kf the destruction operator for a baryon of momentum ~k and flavour f ,\nthe spin label being omitted for simplicity. Note that the mean field approximation amounts to setting \u03b4\u03c3 = 0 in the Hamiltonian (9).\nThe meson field solution in the general case is of little interest to us, so we\ndirectly give the solution for a uniform system in which case \u03c3\u0304 is a constant\ndetermined by the self consistent equation:\n\u03c3\u0304 = \u2212\n\n1\n\u2202K\n<\n>\n2\nm\u03c3\n\u2202 \u03c3\u0304\n\n(11)\n\nwhich must be solved numerically and the fluctuation \u03b4\u03c3 is given by:\n\u03b4\u03c3(~r) =\n\nZ\n\n\u2032\n\nd~q ei~q.(~r\u2212~r )\nd~r\u2032\n(2\u03c0)3 q 2 + m\u03032\u03c3\n\n\u2202K \u2032\n\u2202K\n\u2212\n(~r )+ <\n>\n\u2202 \u03c3\u0304\n\u2202 \u03c3\u0304\n\n!\n\n(12)\n\nwhere the effective \u03c3 mass is:\nm\u03032\u03c3 = m2\u03c3 + <\n\n\u22022K\n>.\n\u2202 \u03c3\u0304 2\n\n(13)\n\n7\n\n\f2.4 Energy density in the Hartree Fock approximation\n\nThe last step in our formal development is to use Eqs. (9-12) to compute\nthe energy density of nuclear matter in the Hartree-Fock approximation. The\nground state of the system is specified by a set of Fermi levels, {kF (f ), f =\nP\np, n...}, and their corresponding baryonic densities {nf } with nB = f nf .\nOne has:\nkZ\nF (f )\nq\n2 X\n~k k 2 + M 2 (\u03c3\u0304)\n< K(\u03c3\u0304) >=\nd\nf\n(2\u03c0)3 f o\n\n(14)\n\nand the energy density takes the form\n\n\u2202K\n1\n< H\u03c3 >\n= < K(\u03c3\u0304) > + 2 <\n>\nV\n2m\u03c3\n\u2202 \u03c3\u0304\n\n!2\n\n1\n\nkF (f )\n1 X Z\nd~k1d~k2\n+\n(2\u03c0)6 f\n0\n\n\u2202 q 2\n\u2202 q 2\nk1 + M 2 (\u03c3\u0304)\nk2 + M 2 (\u03c3\u0304).\n2\n2\n~\n~\n\u2202\n\u03c3\u0304\n\u2202\n\u03c3\u0304\n(k1 \u2212 k2 ) + m\u0303\u03c3\n\n(15)\n\nFinally we must add the contributions < V\u03c9 > and < V\u03c1 >, corresponding to\n\u03c9 and \u03c1 exchange. The derivation follows the same line as for the \u03c3 exchange\nbut is much simpler and gives the exact solution because these interactions\nare purely 2-body .

However, this cannot take into account the long\nranged single pion exchange. In the Hartree Fock approximation, the latter\ncontributes only through the exchange (Fock) term, so its contribution to\nthe energy is modest. Nevertheless, we think it is worthwhile to study its\nimpact on our results because, as a consequence of its long range, the pion\ncontribution to the energy has, as compared to the heavy mesons, a specific\ndensity dependence. With this in mind, we generalize the expression of Ref. [20]\nso as to include the contribution of the full octet.

(19), gA = 1.26 is the axial coupling constant of the nucleon, f\u03c0 =\n93 MeV is the pion decay constant and m\u03c0 its mass. In the loop integral\nJf f \u2032 , the first term is the so-called contact term. In practice it can hardly be\ndistinguished from the short-ranged contributions of the heavy mesons and\nwe omit it. We have checked that it would only induce a small readjustment\nof G\u03c3 , G\u03c9 , G\u03c1 . In the same spirit we have omitted any \u03c0-baryon form factor in\nJf f \u2032 , because the effect of a form factor is to cut off the large momenta of the\nloop and it therefore amounts to a short ranged contribution. In summary, we\nkeep only the long ranged Yukawa piece of the pion exchange.\n2.5 Fixing the parameters\nThe parameters of the model are the couplings G\u03c3 , G\u03c9 , G\u03c1 , the meson masses\nand the free nucleon radius. We set the \u03c0, \u03c9, \u03c1 masses to their physical values.\nf ree\nWe have tried several values of the free nucleon radius, RN\n, and found that\nf ree\nthis has very little influence on our results. We therefore take RN\n= 0.8 fm,\nwhich is a realistic value [21]. The \u03c3 meson mass is not well known because\nthe width of the \u03c0\u03c0 resonance is very large in the physical region. In our study\nof finite nuclei [16], we found that m\u03c3 \u223c 700 MeV produced the best results,\nso this will be our prefered value. However, the sensitivity of the calculations\n9\n\n\fof finite nuclei to the \u03c3 meson mass comes from the fact that it controls the\nshape of the nuclear surface, a factor which is irrelevant in the case of neutron\nstars. Moreover, since the calculations for finite nuclei are based on a nonrelativistic, low density approximation 3 to the Hamiltonian (9), we must be\nconservative about the \u03c3 meson mass when we use it in the high density region.\nTherefore, to quantify the influence of this mass, we shall show some results\nfor m\u03c3 = 600 MeV.\nThe remaining free parameters, G\u03c3 , G\u03c9 and G\u03c1 are adjusted to reproduce\nthe binding energy and the asymmetry energy of ordinary nuclear matter at\nthe saturation point. Since we want to sample the stiffness of our equation\nof state, we allow some freedom in the way the couplings are fixed. This is\nsummarized in Table 2. First we set the pion contribution to zero and adjust\nthe couplings to reproduce the experimental values of the binding energy, (E =\n\u221215.865 MeV), and asymmetry energy, (as = 30 MeV), of nuclear matter\nat the saturation point (n0 = 0.16 fm\u22123 ). This defines the models QMC600\nand QMC700, according to the value of the \u03c3 meson mass. For all the other\nmodels (QMC\u03c0i, i = 1, 4) we set m\u03c3 = 700 MeV and the effect of the pion is\nincluded. As can be seen in the last column of Table 2, the incompressibility\nmodulus of both QMC600 and QMC700 is above the accepted range, 200 \u00f7\n300 MeV. The most efficient way to decrease K\u221e is to add an attractive\ninteraction which has a weak density dependence at the saturation point.\nThe pion Fock term, which is attractive and behaves roughly as \u03c11/6 , is thus\na natural candidate. This is confirmed by the model QMC\u03c01, where the pion\ncontribution is included and where K\u221e drops from 340 MeV to 322 MeV. A\ntrivial way to mock up the effect of an almost constant attractive interaction\nis simply to decrease the absolute value of the experimental binding energy.\nBy setting E = \u221214.5 MeV, a rather moderate distortion of the experimental\nnumber, we already find K\u221e = 301 MeV. This defines QMC\u03c02. In order to\nsample a wider range of values of the stiffness, we allow ourself to artificially\nvary both the pion contribution and the binding energy. This leads to model\nQMC\u03c03 (resp. QMC\u03c04), where the pion contribution is multiplied by 1.5\n(resp. 2) and the binding energy is set to \u221214 MeV (resp \u221213 MeV). This\ngives K\u221e = 283 MeV and K\u221e = 256 MeV, respectively. Note that increasing\nthe pion contribution by a factor of 2 is not so arbitrary, because we know\nthat it is amplified by RPA correlations [22]. On the other hand, changing the\nexperimental binding energy is more difficult to justify and we take it only as\na crude way to sample the stiffness of the model, given its eventual application\nin the high density region, far away from the point where E is measured.\n\n3\n\nBy this we mean a density about or smaller than the density of ordinary nuclear\nmatter.\n\n10\n\n\fModel\n\nm\u03c3 ( MeV)\n\n\u03c0\n\nE( MeV)\n\nG\u03c3 ( fm2 )\n\nG\u03c9 ( fm2 )\n\nG\u03c1 ( fm2 )\n\nK\u221e ( MeV)\n\nQMC600\n\n600\n\n0\n\n-15.865\n\n11.23\n\n7.31\n\n4.81\n\n344\n\nQMC700\n\n700\n\n0\n\n-15.865\n\n11.33\n\n7.27\n\n4.56\n\n340\n\nQMC\u03c01\n\n700\n\n1\n\n-15.865\n\n10.64\n\n7.11\n\n3.96\n\n322\n\nQMC\u03c02\n\n700\n\n1\n\n-14.5\n\n10.22\n\n6.91\n\n3.90\n\n301\n\nQMC\u03c03\n\n700\n\n1.5\n\n-14\n\n9.69\n\n6.73\n\n3.57\n\n283\n\nQMC\u03c04\n700\n2\n-13\n8.97\n6.43\n3.22\n256\nTable 2\nThe couplings for different versions of the model.

The structure\nof the neutron stars is discussed in the next section. Uniform matter in cold\nneutron stars is in a generalized beta-equilibrium, achieved over an extended\nperiod of time. All baryons of the octet can be populated by succcessive weak\ninteractions, regardless of their strangeness [23]. We consider matter formed by\nbaryons of the octet, electrons and negative muons, with respective densities\n{nf , f = p, n, ...} and {ne , n\u03bc }.\nThe equilibrium state minimises the total energy density, \u01eb, under the constraint of baryon number conservation and electric neutrality. We write:\n\u01eb = \u01ebB (np , ...) + \u01ebe (ne ) + \u01eb\u03bc (n\u03bc )\n\n(21)\n\nwhere the baryonic contribution\n\u01ebB (np , ...) =\n\n< H\u03c3 + V\u03c9 + V\u03c1 + V\u03c0 >\nV\n\n(22)\n\nis calculated from Eqs. (15-19). It is related to the binding energy per baryon,\nE, by:\n\u01ebB (np , ...) =\n\nX\n\n(E + Mf )nf .\n\n(23)\n\nf\n\nThe baryonic pressure, (PB ), the incompressibility modulus, (K\u221e ), and the\n11\n\n\fsound velocity, (vs ), of baryonic matter have the following expressions:\n\u2202PB\n\u2202 \u01ebB\nPB = n2B\n, K\u221e = 9\n, vs =\n\u2202nB nB\n\u2202nB\n\ns\n\nnB K\u221e\n9(\u01ebB + PB )\n\n(24)\n\nwhere nB = f nf and the derivative, with respect to nB , is taken at constant\nfractions (nf /nB , f = 1, 8). Similar expressions hold for each lepton. In protonneutron matter another important variable is the symmetry energy, S, defined\nas the difference between pure neutron and symmetric matter :\nP\n\nS(nB ) = E((np = 0, nn = nB ) \u2212 E (np = nB /2, nn = nB /2) .\n\n(25)\n\nFor the energy density of the lepton l, of mass ml and density nl , we use the\nfree Fermi gas expression:\n2\n\u01ebl (nl ) =\n(2\u03c0)3\n\nkZF (l)\n\nq\nk 3 (l)\nd~k k 2 + m2l , with nl = F 2 .\n3\u03c0\n\n(26)\n\nThe equilibrium condition for a neutral system with baryon density nB is\n\u03b4[\u01ebB (np , ...) + \u01ebe (ne ) + \u01eb\u03bc (n\u03bc )\n+\u03bb(\n\nX\n\nnf \u2212 nB ) + \u03bd(\n\nf\n\nX\n\nnf qf \u2212 (ne + n\u03bc )] = 0\n\n(27)\n\nf\n\nwhere qf is the charge of the flavor f . The constraints are implemented through\nthe Lagrange multipliers (\u03bb, \u03bd) so the variation in Eq. (27) amounts to independent variations of the densities, together with variations of \u03bb and \u03bd. If one\ndefines the chemical potentials as\n\u03bcf =\n\nq\n\u2202\u01ebB\n\u2202\u01ebl\n, \u03bcl =\n= kF2 (l) + m2l\n\u2202nf\n\u2202nl\n\n(28)\n\nthe equilibrium equations become:\n\u03bci + \u03bb + \u03bdqi = 0, f = p, ...,\n\u03bce \u2212 \u03bd = 0,\n\u03bc\u03bc \u2212 \u03bd = 0,\nX\n\n(29)\n(30)\n(31)\n\nnf \u2212 nB = 0,\n\n(32)\n\nnf qf \u2212 (ne + n\u03bc ) = 0.\n\n(33)\n\nf\n\nX\nf\n\n12\n\n\fThis is a system of non-linear equations for {np , ..., ne , n\u03bc , \u03bb, \u03bd}. It is usual to\neliminate the Lagrange multipliers, (\u03bb, \u03bd), using Eqs. (30) and (29), with f =\nneutron. However, for a given value of nB , the equilibrium equation, Eq. (27),\ngenerally implies that some of the densities vanish and therefore that the\nequations generated by their variation drop from the system (29-31) \u2013 because\nthere is nothing to vary! In particular, substituting \u03bd = \u03bce in Eqs. (29) is not\nvalid when the electron disappears from the system. The equations obtained\nby this substitution may have no solution in the deleptonized region, since one\nhas forced \u03bd = 0. To correct for this, one must restore \u03bd as an independent\nvariable when one reaches this region. This is technically inconvenient and we\nfound it is much simpler to blindly solve the full system of equations, (29-33),\nfor the set {np , ..., ne , n\u03bc , \u03bb, \u03bd}. The only simplification which is not dangerous\nis the elimination of the muon density in favor of the electron density by\ncombining Eqs. (30,31) to write \u03bc\u03bc = \u03bce , which is solved by\nq\n\nkF (\u03bc) = R kF (e)2 + m2e \u2212 m2\u03bc\n\n(34)\n\nwhere R denotes the real part. This is always correct because if the electron\ndensity vanishes then so does the muon density and the relation (34) reduces\nto 0 = 0.\nTo solve the system (29-33), let us define the set of relative concentrations\n(note that the lepton concentrations are also defined with respect to nB )\nnp nn n\u039b\nne n\u03bc\nY = {yi } =\n.\n,\n,\n, ...,\n,\nnB nB nB\nnB nB\n\u001a\n\n\u001b\n\n(35)\n\nEach member, yi , of the set Y is associated with an equation Ei , the one among\nEqs. (29,31) which is obtained by taking the variation of \u01eb with respect to \u03c1i =\nyi nB . Let us assume that a solution, Y0 , has been found at some baryon density,\nnB = n0 . One first tests whether the threshold for some species, i, is crossed\nwhen n0 is incremented by \u03b4n. Since yi = 0 below and across the theshold, the\ncondition for the appearance of the species is that Ei (nB , Y0) changes its sign\nbetween n0 and n0 +\u03b4n. If this happens, the equation Ei is added to the system.\nIf the threshold condition is met for several species, all the corresponding\nequations are added. The system is then solved numerically at nB = n0 + \u03b4n0 ,\nusing Y0 as a first approximation. When a concentration drops below a given\nsmall number, \u03b7, it is set to zero and the corresponding equation is removed\nfrom the system. The value of \u03b7 depends on the accuracy of the solution and\nin our calculation it has been set to 10\u22124 . We have checked that \u03b7 = 10\u22123\ngives the same result. We solve the system with the initial condition that\nat nB = 0 the matter contains only neutrons. Once the equilibrium solution\nY (nB ) has been found for the desired range of baryon density, typically nB =\n0\u00f71.2fm\u22123 , it is used to compute the equilibrium total energy density, \u01eb(nB ) =\n13\n\n\f\u01eb(yp nB , ..., y\u03bc nB ). The corresponding total pressure, P (nB ), is computed as\nthe sum of the baryon pressure, (24), and of the lepton pressures. Using the\nequilibrium equations, Eqs. (29-33), it is straightforward to show that the total\npressure can also be evaluated as (note the total derivative):\nP (nB ) = n2B\n\nd \u01eb(nB )\n.\ndnB nB\n\n(36)\n\nAs a numerical check, we used both expressions, which did indeed yield the\nsame result within the numerical accuracy.\n\n4\n\nNeutron Stars\n\nA neutron star is an object composed of matter at densities ranging from that\nof terrestrial iron up to several times that of nuclear matter. In cold neutron\nstars, as the baryon density nB increases from about 0.75 n0 up to 2 \u00f7 3n0 ,\nstellar matter becomes a homogeneous system of unbound neutrons, protons,\nelectrons and muons and, if enough time is allowed, will develop \u03b2-equilibrium\nwith respect to the weak interactions. All components that are present on a\ntimescale longer than the life-time of the system take part in equilibrium. For\nexample, neutrinos created in weak processes in a cold neutron star do not\ncontribute to the equilibrium conditions as they escape rapidly. At even higher\ndensities, heavier mesons and strange baryons play a role (see e.g. Ref. [24]\nand references therein, [25,26,27,28]). Ultimately, at the center of the star,\na quark matter phase may appear, either alone or coexisting with hadronic\nmatter [23,29,30,31]. Below nB \u223c 0.75 n0 , the matter forms the inner and\nouter crust of the star, with inhomogeneities consisting of nucleons arranged\non a lattice, as well as neutron and electron gases. In this density region the\nQMC Equation of State (EoS) needs to be matched onto other equations\nof state, reflecting the composition of matter at those densities. The BaymBethe-Pethick (BBP) [32] and Baym-Pethick-Sutherland (BPS) EoS [33] are\nused in this work.\nSetting up an EoS over the full density range, up to at least 6 n0 , allows\ncalculation of one of the most important observables of neutron stars, the\nmaximum gravitational mass, Mgmax , and the corresponding radius, Rmax . The\nmost accurately measured masses of neutron stars were, until very recently,\nconsistent with the range 1.26 to 1.45 M\u2299 [5]. However, Nice et al. [34] recently\nprovided a dramatic result for the gravitational mass of the PSR J0751+1807\nmillisecond pulsar (in a binary system with a helium white dwarf), Mg = 2.1\u00b1\n0.2 M\u2299 (with 68% confidence) or 2.1+0.4\n\u22120.5 with 95% confidence which makes it\nthe most massive pulsar measured. This observation potentially offers one of\nthe most stringent tests for the EoS used in the calculation of cold neutron\n14\n\n\fstars. It also sets an upper limit to the mass density, or equivalently, the energy\ndensity, inside the star [5]. A lower limit to the mass density can be derived\nusing the latest data on the largest observed redshift from a neutron star,\ncombined with its observational gravitational mass.\nThe calculated maximum mass is determined to large extent by the high density EoS. It has been argued that extrapolation of the nucleon-based EOS,\nbuilt using an effective force (e.g. non-relativistic Skyrme [4], relativistic mean\nfield [23]) or phenomenological interactions (such as A18+\u03b4v+ UIX\u2217 (APR) [35])\nto densities corresponding to Mgmax , may not be unreasonable [35,36] and that\nthe error made by not including the heavy baryons and possible quarks in the\ncalculation may not be significant. On the other hand, we note that in the\nhybrid calculations of Lawley et al. [13], the maximum mass of a neutron star\nwas significantly reduced. In any case, we will explore the consequences of this\nextrapolation by using the QMC EoS and taking into account the different\ncomposition of the homogeneous matter, starting from a nucleon-only model\nand then including the full baryon octet. We shall also comment shortly on the\npresence of exotics, such as penta-quarks and 6-quarks bags, in high density\nmatter. Furthermore, neutron star models at around the 'canonical' mass of\n1.4M\u2299 , with central densities of the order 2\u00f72.5 n0 and lower, are also studied\nas representative cases for nucleon-only based EoS.\n\n4.1 Cold non-rotational neutron star models\n\nThe gravitational mass and the radius are calculated using a tabulated form of\nthe composite EoS with a chosen QMC interaction. The Tolman-OppenheimerVolkov equation [37,38]\ndP\nGm\u03c1 (1 + P/\u03c1) (1 + 4\u03c0r 3 P /m)\n=\u2212 2\ndr\nr\n1 \u2212 2Gm/r\n\n(37)\n\nis integrated with\nm(r) =\n\nZr\n\n2\n\n4\u03c0r \u2032 \u03c1(r \u2032 ) dr \u2032,\n\n(38)\n\n0\n\nwhere \u03c1 is the total mass density and G is the gravitational constant, in order to obtain sequences of neutron-star models corresponding to any specified\ncentral mass density. The solution gives directly the radius, R, of the star (the\nsurface being at the location where the pressure vanishes) and the corresponding value for the total gravitational mass Mg = m(R).\n15\n\n\fIt is also important to calculate some other properties of these neutron star\nmodels. The total baryon number A is given by\nA=\n\nZR\n0\n\n4\u03c0r 2 nB (r)dr\n(1 \u2212 2Gm(r)/r)1/2\n\n.\n\n(39)\n\nThe total baryon number, A, multiplied by the atomic mass unit, 931.50 MeV,\ndefines the baryonic mass M0 . The binding energy released in a supernova\ncore-collapse, forming eventually the neutron star, is approximately\nEbind = (Am0 \u2212 Mg ) ,\n\n(40)\n\nwhere m0 is defined as the mass per baryon of 56 Fe. Analysis of data from\nsupernova 1987A leads to an estimate of Ebind = 3.8 \u00b1 1.2 \u00d7 1053 erg [39].\nThe gravitational red shift of the photons emitted radially outwards from a\nneutron star surface is given by\nzsurf\n\n2GMg\n= 1\u2212\nR\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\u22121/2\n\n\u22121\n\n(41)\n\nIt is an important quantity needed, for example, for obtaining the mass and\nradius of a neutron star separately [5]. Other quantities of interest for possible comparison with observational data are the minimum rotation period,\n\u03c4min [40], and the moment of inertia I (see Ref. [6] and references therein). The\nminimum period is given by the centrifugal balance condition for an equatorial\nfluid element (i.e., the condition for it to be moving on a circular geodesic).\nWhile determining this accurately requires using a numerical code for constructing general-relativistic models of rapidly rotating stars, quite good values can be obtained from results for non-rotating models using the empirical\nformula [41,42]\n\u03c4min = 0.820\n\nMgmax\nM\u2299\n\n!\u22121/2 \u0012\n\nRmax\n10 km\n\n\u00133/2\n\nms .\n\n(42)\n\nThe shortest period so far observed is 0.877 ms [40] but it is possible that\nthis limit may be connected with the techniques used for measuring pulsar\nperiods, rather than being a genuine physical limit.\nThe moment of inertia I is calculated in this work by assuming that the\nrotation is sufficiently slow that the general relativistic slow rotation approximation [43] gives a rather accurate description of the star and the surrounding\nspace-time and using the expressions given in Ref. [44].\n16\n\n\f5\n\nResults and discussion\n\n5.1 Uniform matter\n\nThe properties of uniform matter and neutrons stars were calculated for 12\nEoS designed to systematically investigate the dependence on the basic QMC\nmodel parameters, summarised in Table 2. There are three types of EoS used\nin this work. They have the same QMC parameters but differ by the limitation\nthat we impose on the matter composition. The sets F-QMCx, where x refers\nto the parametrisations of Table 2, describe matter consisting of the full baryon\noctet plus electrons and muons. The sets N-QMCx are used for n + p + e + \u03bc\nmatter and PNM-QMCx for pure neutron matter. For simplicity, we only\nshow results for QMC700 and QMC\u03c04 in this section. These sets have the\nmost realistic values of the QMC parameters and correspond to two rather\ndifferent values of K\u221e , 340 and 256 MeV. In the next section all the QMC\nparametrisations of Table 2 are used for the calculation of neutron star models\nand their properties are discussed in more detail.\nIn addition to the QMC EoS, we use four other models for a comparison\nbased on very different physics. The older Bethe-Johnson (BJ) EoS [45] is\nbased on the modified Reid potential and the medium effects are treated using constrained variational principle (model C in [24]). The BJ EoS describes\nuniform matter including n, p, \u039b, \u03a3\u00b1,0 , \u2206\u00b1,0 and \u2206++ . The more recent EoS,\ncalculated with the A18+\u03b4v+UIX\u2217 potential (APR) [35], is based on the Argonne A18 two-body interaction and includes three-body effects through the\nUrbana UIX\u2217 potential. It also includes boost corrections to the two-nucleon\ninteraction which corresponds to the leading relativistic effects at order v 2 .\nThis interaction is considered one of the most modern phenomenological potentials used for the description of nuclear matter containing nucleons only.\nAs an example of a phenomenological, nucleon-only EoS the Skyrme SkM\u2217\ninteraction is used, in particular because of the similarity of its results for finite nuclei to those of the effective force derived from the QMC model [15,16].\nFinally, we also compare with the EoS of a hybrid (neutron-quark) star matter\nof Glendenning (Table 9.1 of [23]) (Hybrid) calculated in RMF approximation.\nThe binding energy per particle in pure neutron matter (PNM) and symmetric nuclear matter (SNM), for QMC700 and QMC\u03c04, are illustrated in Fig. 1\nin comparison with the APR and SkM\u2217 predictions. At lower densities the\ncalculated values are very similar. However, with increasing density the differences become more dramatic. In particular, while the QMC and APR models\npredict a steady increase of the energy per particle in both pure neutron and\nsymmetric matter at about the same rate, the SkM\u2217 model yields a more rapid\ngrowth of the energy per particle in SNM than in PNM, leading to crossing\nat about 0.9 fm\u22123 . As shown in Fig. 2 and discussed in detail in [4], this leads\n17\n\n\f400\n\n400\nQMC700 PNM\nQMC700 SNM\nQMC\u03c04 PNM\nQMC\u03c04 SNM\n\n\u03b5 [MeV]\n\n300\n\n300\n\n200\n\n200\n\n100\n\n100\n\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n0.6\n-3\nnB [fm ]\n\nAPR PNM\nAPR SNM\nSkM* PNM\nSkM* SNM\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n0.6\n-3\nnB [fm ]\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nFig. 1. The energy per particle for pure neutron and symmetric nuclear matter is\nplotted as a function of baryon number density nB for the QMC700 and QMC\u03c04\ninteractions (left panel). For comparison, also shown are equivalent curves calculated\nusing the APR potential [35] and the Skyrme SkM\u2217 parametrisations (right panel)\n\nto negative symmetry energy and a collapse of nuclear matter. Although the\nQMC and Skyrme energy functionals have similar structure and yield similar\nresults for finite nuclei at normal nuclear density, QMC has a different density\nand isospin dependence [16] that improves the EoS at high densities in comparison with SkM\u2217 , while the symmetry energy shows a slower increase with\ndensity than the APR model. There is no experimental evidence concerning\nthe density dependence of the symmetry energy, as it is not possible to study\nthe properties of uniform matter at high densities in terrestrial conditions.\nEven in heavy-ion collisions at high energies the maximum baryon density\nreached is unlikely to exceed 2 \u00f7 3n0 in the phase of the reaction closest to the\nconditions in cold neutron stars. Nevertheless, there is some indirect evidence\nwhich seems to support models which predict that the symmetry energy grows\nwith density [4]. Such models yield sensible results for properties of neutron\nstars that can be compared with observations (see Section 4).\nThe results of our calculation of the equilibrium composition of uniform matter\nfor QMC700 and QMC\u03c04 are shown in Fig. 3. In a striking difference from\nall other models which include the full baryon octet, QMC does not predict\nthe production of hyperons at densities less than 3 times nuclear saturation\ndensity. Furthermore, the first hyperons to appear are the cascades, \u039e, together\nwith the \u039b hyperon. The \u03a3 hyperons are not produced at densities below 1.2\nfm\u22123 . This scenario is a direct consequence of three factors which are present\nin the QMC model and absent in the others. First, we use the Hartree-Fock\napproximation, while the earlier calculations worked only at the Hartree level.\nActually, we see no reason to ignore antisymmetrisation, which is the key to\nour successful interpretation ofthe spectra of finite nuclei [16].

For more explanation see text.\n\ncolor hyperfine interaction, which is necessary to explain the mass splitting\nwithin the octet, as well as the N\u2206 splitting, induces a flavor dependent\neffective mass which strongly disfavors the \u03a3. Third, the scalar polarisability,\nd, induces many body effects which tend to amplify the previous ones.\nTo make these considerations quantitative, we have computed the single particle threshold densities on top of neutron matter, using the QMC700 parametrization and the variations on it defined earlier. The results are shown in Table 3,\nwhere the first column corresponds to the full QMC700 model as shown in\nFig. 3. In the second column we show the same calculation but with the hyperfine color interaction and the scalar polarisability set to zero for the strange\nparticles. Clearly this produces a very spectacular effect on the \u03a3 thresholds,\n19\n\n\fHartree-Fock\n\nHartree-Fock\n\nHartree\n\nHartree\n\nQMC700\n\nQMC700, hfc=d=0\n\nQMC700\n\nQMC700, hfc=d=0\n\n\u039b\n\n0.555\n\n0.42\n\n0.35\n\n0.31\n\n\u03a3\u2212\n\n0.92\n\n0.51\n\n0.41\n\n0.3\n\n\u03a30\n\n0.97\n\n0.58\n\n0.61\n\n0.44\n\n\u03a3+\n\n1.01\n\n0.63\n\n0.87\n\n0.61\n\n\u039e0\n\n0.59\n\n0.54\n\n0.58\n\n0.55\n\n\u039e\u2212\n0.55\n0.50\n0.45\n0.43\nTable 3\nSingle particle threshold densities (in fm\u22123 ) on top of neutron matter for QMC700,\neither in Hartree or Hartree-Fock approximation and with the hyperfine color interaction (hfc) and scalar polarisability, d, set to zero in the strange sector.\n\nwhich become comparable to the \u039e thresholds. In the third column we show\nthe same calculation as in the first but now in the Hartree approximation, that\nis dropping the exchange terms in Eqs. (15-17) and readjusting the coupling to\nreproduce the saturation point of nuclear matter. One observes again a strong\nrearrangement of the threshholds in favor of the \u03a3. Finally, the last column\nshows the combination of both effects. With these three alterations, the QMC\nmodel obviously becomes similar to the SU(3) relativistic mean field models\n\u2013 with respect to strangeness production. In particular, the first threshold is\nnow for the \u03a3\u2212 , almost identical to that for the \u039b and it occurs at less than\ntwice the nuclear density.\nAs expected, the presence of hyperons does soften the EoS, as demonstrated\nin Fig. 4. We observe that QMC700 and QMC\u03c04 both show a very similar\nEoS to that for the BJ model, which also contains hyperons. However, it is\nclearly demonstrated that the composition of the stellar matter is not the only\nway to soften the EoS. The pressure also depends critically on the potentials\nacting between the particles present and, in turn, on the density dependence\nof the symmetry energy. Thus, for example, the SkM\u2217 Skyrme model produces a very soft EoS, in contrast to APR, and almost the same EoS as the\nneutron+quark RMF hybrid model. Clearly more constraints are needed to\ndistinguish amongst these possibilities. Further illustrations of the variety of\npossibilities for the dependence of the pressure on the total energy density can\nbe found in Ref. [46].\nTo conclude this Section, let us mention that we have also studied the possibility that matter at high density may contain exotic particles, such as pentaquarks or six quarks bags. The calculation goes along the same lines as for\nthe ordinary baryonic matter and poses no conceptual difficulties because, in\nbeta equilibrium, one does not worry about the exact way a particular compo20\n\n\fN1\n\np1\n\nN2\n\np2\n\nr\n\na\n\nN-QMC700\n\n0\n\n8.623 10\u22123\n\n1.548\n\n342.4\n\n184.4\n\nN-QMC\u03c04\n\n0\n\n4.634 10\u22123\n\n1.623\n\n346.7\n\n192.1\n\nN-QMC700\n\n2.62 10\n\n\u22127\n\n3.197\n\n0.0251\n\n1.286\n\n522.1\n\n113\n\nF-QMC\u03c04\n\n8.476 10\u22128\n\n3.328\n\n0.03178\n\n1.254\n\n514.5\n\n145.5\n\nTable 4\nThe parameters of the fit defined by eq.43\n\nnent has been produced. The practical problem is that these would-be exotics\nhave not been identified as free particles and therefore their free masses (if\nthey exist) are essentially unknown. To get an estimate of these masses, which\nare of course the critical parameters, we must rely on the bag model. It turns\nout that, even if we allow the exotics to be lighter than the bag model prediction by as much as 400 MeV, they do not appear at any significant level when\nthe conditions for beta equilibrium are imposed on matter where the full octet\nis allowed.\nFor the readers convenience we have preformed an analytical fit of our EOS\nfor the cases shown on Figure 4.

For comparison, the results for the\nBJ, APR, SkM\u2217 and Hybrid EoS are also included. The same information is\ngiven for these models for stars with 'canonical' mass 1.4 M\u2299 in Table 6. It\nshould be noted that the entries in Table 6 do not differ for the full octet\nand nucleon-only versions of the model, because the central density of 1.4 M\u2299\nstars is below the threshold for the creation of hyperons.\nThe relation between the gravitational mass and radius for various neutron\nstar models is shown in Fig. 5, for a representative set of EoS, chosen to be\nF-QMC700, F-QMC\u03c04, N-QMC700 and N-QMC\u03c04.\nApart from the basic mass-radius relation, there are other features of neutron\nstars that provide the possibility to constrain the EoS and thus the nucleon21\n\n\f500\n\n500\nN-QMC700\nN-QMC\u03c04\nF-QMC700\nF-QMC\u03c04\n\n400\n\n300\n\nP=\u03b5\n\n300\n\nP=\u03b5\n\n3\n\nP[MeV/fm ]\n\n400\n\nBJ\nAPR\nSkM*\nHybrid\n\n200\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0\n\n100\n\n0\n\n400\n800\n3\n\u03b5[MeV/fm ]\n\n1200\n\n0\n\n0\n\n400\n800\n3\n\u03b5[MeV/fm ]\n\n1200\n\nFig. 4.

Assuming that there is no (or negligible) baryon loss\nduring the collapse, the newly born neutron star will have the same baryonic\nmass as the progenitor star. For any given EoS for cold neutron star matter\nthe relation between the gravitational and baryonic mass can be calculated\nand tested against a very narrow window (full black line box in Fig. 6)defined by the data for Pulsar B. The width of the window reflects uncertainty\nin modelling the composition of the progenitor core, namely electron-capture\nrates, nuclear network calculation, Coulomb and general relativity corections.\nVery recently, another simulation of the explosion of O-Ne-Mg cores [47] has\nbeen performed which predicts the baryonic mass of Pulsar B 1.36\u00b10.002 M\u2299\n(full blue line box in Fig. 6).

Measurement of the moment of inertia of Pulsar A (with known\nmass of about 1.34 M\u2299 ) in the same system, to \u223c10% precision, would allow a\nrather accurate estimate of the radius of the star and of the pressure in matter\nof density in the vicinity of 1 \u00f7 2n0 . Such information could provide a rather\nstrong constraint on the EoS of neutron stars. In Fig. 7, using exactly the same\nscale as as Fig. 1 of Ref. [6], we illustrate this possibility. The dashed horizontal\nlines depict the error range of a hypothetical result of a measurement, selected\nas close as possible to the expected value. If this were the actual experimental\nresult, many EoS would not be useful in determining the radius of Pulsar A,\nas they would cross the area between the two dashed lines either below or\nabove M = 1.34 M\u2299 . The QMC EoS would satisfy this constraint. Moreover,\ntheir relatively weak mass dependence would be an advantage in the study of\nof another analogous system with known mass up to \u223c1.6 M\u2299 (N-QMC\u03c04)\nand \u223c2 M\u2299 . We note that incorporation of hyperons shortens this range at\nhigher masses, as illustrated in Fig. 7.\nFinally, we study the implications of the baryon composition of stellar matter, as calculated using the sample EoS, for a possible cooling mechanism of\nneutron stars either just after their birth in supernovae or after heating in an\naccretion episode. The cooling mechanisms can, in principle, provide further\nimportant constraints on neutron-star models. However, as discussed in more\ndetail previously [44], the cooling processes for both young and old neutron\nstars are not currently known with any certainty, although several scenarios\nhave been proposed [49,50]. Many of them involve emission of neutrinos from\n25\n\n\fF-QMC700\nF-QMC\u03c04\nN-QMC700\nN-QMC\u03c04\nAPR\n\nproton fraction yp\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n-3\n\nnB [fm ]\n\nFig. 8.

The data for the\nAPR EoS are added for comparison.\n\nthe stellar core. The most frequently discussed, the direct URCA process, produces neutrinos in proton-neutron weak decays with an additional production\nof either electrons of muons. The proton concentration in the matter is a crucial ingredient of the process. Conservation of energy and momentum requires\nyn1/3 < yp1/3 + ye1/3 , or yn1/3 < yp1/3 + y\u03bc1/3 , to be satisfied. This, in turn, can happen only in matter where the proton fraction grows steadily with increasing\ndensity and yp is greater than about 0.11 for matter consisting of only protons,\nneutrons and electrons. Medium effects and additional interactions among the\nparticles change this number only slightly [46] but the presence of muons increases the critical ratio, yp , to about 0.15. We display the proton fraction for\nsample EoS in Fig. 8. It is clear that the proton fraction in F-QMC700 and\nF-QMC\u03c04 pass this critical limit at densities close to 0.6 fm\u22123 , coincident with\nthe appearence of negative \u039e\u2212 hyperons. This density is well below the central\ndensity for maximum mass models and thus the direct URCA process is allowed for models of astrophysical interest, in agreement with expectation. On\nthe contrary, for the N-QMC700 and N-QMC\u03c04 models the critical density for\nthe start of the direct URCA process is much higher, between 0.8 \u00f7 1.0 fm\u22123 ,\nand is close to or exceeds the inferred maximum central density, suggesting\nthat this cooling mechanism would not be allowed in these cases. This reinforces our message concerning the importance of incorporating of the full\nbaryon octet in QMC.\n\n6\n\nConclusions\n\nOne of the most important features of the QMC EoS is that although the QMC\nand Skyrme energy functionals have similar structure at densities close to\nnuclear saturation density, they differ significantly at higher densities, because\n26\n\n\fof their different density and isospin dependence. The QMC EoS provide cold\nneutron star models with maximum mass 1.9\u20132.1 M\u2299 , with central density less\nthan 6 times nuclear saturation density and thus offer a consistent description\nof the stellar mass up to this density limit, without extrapolation beyond the\nregion of validity \u2013 as needed, for example, when the non-relativistic, nucleononly Skyrme models are used at these densities. The maximum mass of neutron\nstars in the QMC model is close to the most recent observation, the central\ndensity is relatively low in comparison to other models and all the predicted\nstars are well within the causal limit.\nThe QMC model includes self-consistently the presence of hyperons at high\ndensities. Unlike most other models, no hyperon contribution at densities lower\nthan 3 n0 is predicted in \u03b2-equilibrium matter. At higher densities, \u039e\u2212,0 and\n\u039b hyperons are present. The absence of the \u03a3\u00b1,0 hyperons is due, on the one\nhand, to the unique features of the model, namely the implementation of the\ncolor hyperfine interaction and the scalar polarisability of the baryons and,\non the other hand, to the use of the Hartree-Fock approximation. The pronounced effects of the presence of hyperons on the properties of dense matter\nand neutron star models have been identified by a comparison of nucleon-only\nEoS with full-baryon-octet EoS. In nuclear matter, the presence of hyperons,\nas expected, softens the EoS as illustrated in Fig. 4. However, it needs to be\nstressed that the composition of stellar matter at high density is not necessarily the only determining factor of the behaviour of pressure with increasing\ndensity. In fact, it is critically dependent on the potentials acting amongst\nparticles present in the matter.\nIn neutron star models, the hyperon component systematically reduces the\nprediction of the maximum mass of a neutron star and increases its radius\nat maximum mass, as demonstrated in Fig. 5. This is a very important finding, because many non-relativistic EoS, including those based on the effective\nSkyrme interaction and the A18+\u03b4v+UIX\u2217 potential, do not include hyperons\nat densities corresponding to the central density of maximum mass star models\nand thus their results should be taken with caution. Moreover, the relationship between the moment of inertia and the stellar gravitational mass, Mg , is\nclearly influenced (see Fig. 7), as is the cooling mechanism expected to take\nplace in neutron stars - the direct URCA process - is predicted to be allowed\nin stars with hyperons but not in nucleon-only neutron stars. It is also important to realise that the models for the nucleon-hyperon and hyperon-hyperon\ninteractions play an important role in this comparison. In future, it would\nbe interesting to apply the present QMC model to non-equilibrium matter\nat finite temperature and produce EoS that could be tested in core-collapse\nsupernova simulation models. The high density threshold for the appearance\nof hyperons probably rules out any hyperon-related effects taking place in the\ncollapsing star at the bounce density of 1.5 \u2212 2.0 n0 , in variance with some\nother EoS with a much lower threshold density (e.g. [51]).\n27\n\n\f7\n\nAcknowledgement\n\nThis work has been supported by US DOE grant DE-FG02-94ER40834 and\nby US DEO grant DE-AC05-06OR23177, under which Jefferson Science Associates operates Jefferson Lab and by the Espace de Structure Nucl\u00e9aire\nTh\u00e9orique du CEA.

Let \u03c3 be the uniform value of the scalar field and\ng\u03c3q its coupling to the u, d quarks. We assume that the strange quark does\nnot interact with the scalar field. Therefore the coupling to the scalar field\namounts to the substitution\nmud \u2192 mud \u2212 g\u03c3q \u03c3, ms \u2192 ms\n\n(55)\n\nin the free mass equation, Eq.

We then get an expansion of\nthe form\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\nf ree\nf ree\nf ree\nf ree\n) = Pf (RN\n)g\u03c3 \u03c3 + Pf (RN\n)(g\u03c3 \u03c3)2 + ....(58)\nMf (\u03c3, RN\n) \u2212 Mf (0, RN\n\n30\n\n\fwhere, by construction\n(1)\n\nf ree\nPN (RN\n) = \u22121.\n\n(59)\n\nIf the mass were approximated by\nMf =\n\nNu,d \u03a9(mud ) + Ns \u03a9(ms )\nf ree\nRN\n\n(60)\n\nwe would have\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\nP\u039b\u03a3 = \u22122/3, P\u039e = \u22121/3,\n\n(61)\n\nbut this approximation is severely broken in the realistic case. The order of the\npolynomials in R has been set to 2 and the coefficients have been fitted over\nthe range [0.7 fm \u2192 1.3 fm]. We have checked that an expansion truncated at\norder (g\u03c3 \u03c3)2 was sufficient, even for scalar fields as large as g\u03c3 \u03c3 = 600 MeV.\nThis corresponds to densities of order 1 fm\u22123 , which is sufficient for our purposes.
