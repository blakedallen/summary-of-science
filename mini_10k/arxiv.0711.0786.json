Introduction\nHawking's quantum field theoretical analysis [1] has shown that a Schwarzschild black\nhole has a thermal radiation with a temperature TH = (8\u03c0M )\u22121 , where M is the mass\nof the black hole. Subsequently, this issue has been investigated in the thermodynamical\nregime through the path-integral approach to the quantization of gravity [2, 3]. It has\nbeen also shown that the entropy of a black hole is always equal to one quarter of the area\nof the event horizon in fundamental units and a stationary system without event horizon\nhas no entropy. Moreover, the thermodynamics in an asymptotically anti-de Sitter black\nhole has been studied in Ref. [4]. Using the Euclidean action approach by Gibbons and\nHawking [2], the thermodynamic local quantities such as temperature, energy, entropy, and\nsurface pressure, have been evaluated in a cavity with a finite size [5, 6, 7, 8]. Unlike other\nquantities related to the size of cavity, the entropy does not have local property of gravity\nsince it agrees with Bekenstein-Hawking entropy depending only on the event horizon. It\nmeans that the entropy is independent of the asymptotic behavior of fields.\nNow, the conventional Heisenberg uncertainty principle(HUP) has been promoted to\nthe generalized uncertainty principle(GUP) [9, 10, 11, 12, 13] based on some aspects of\nquantum gravity and the string theory, which is given by\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2\n2 (\u2206p)\n,\n(1.1)\n\u2206x\u2206p \u2265 ~ 1 + l\n~2\nwhere it leads to the minimal length of \u2206xmin = 2l. The cutoff l may be chosen as a\nstring scale in the context of the perturbative string theory or Plank scale based on the\nquantum gravity. In the brick-wall method [14], the GUP has been used to calculate\nthe entropy of black holes without a cutoff parameter [15, 16, 17, 18] where the minimal\nlength plays the role of ultraviolet cutoff and it is regarded as a natural cutoff. Also, the\ncorrections to entropy by the GUP has been studied in other methods [26]. Recently, the\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n\fthermodynamics and its stability for the Schwarzschild black hole have been studied by\napplying the GUP [19, 20, 21]. They obtained a remnant after evaporation of a black hole\nand it may be stable, however, the relevant thermodynamic quantities should be treated\nas local quantities because the GUP effects significantly appear near horizon.\nOn the other hand, one can generalize the GUP by considering (\u2206x)2 along with (\u2206p)2\nin the uncertainty relation (1.1) for the same footing [22]. Then, the symmetric generalized\nuncertainty principle(SGUP) can be written by\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2\n(\u2206x)2\n2 (\u2206p)\n\u2206x\u2206p \u2265 ~ 1 +\n+\nl\n,\n(1.2)\nL2\n~2\np\nwhich leads to the minimal length of \u2206xmin = 2l/ 1 \u2212 4l2 /L2 and the minimal momentum\np\nof \u2206pmin = 2~/(L 1 \u2212 4l2 /L2 ), where L is another uncertainty constant.\nIn this work, based on the SGUP, we would like to study the thermodynamic behaviors\nof physical quantities of a black hole in the Euclidean action formalism which gives the\nlocal Tolman temperature naturally, and investigate the stability of the black hole in terms\nof the heat capacity. When the temperature is over the critical temperature [23, 24, 25],\nthe small black hole created by the phase transition is unstable and decays to hot flat\nspace or grows to the cavity size, which can be expanded to the infinity. However, in\nthe GUP improved thermodynamics, the small black hole cannot decay to hot flat space\nby the thermal radiation since there is the minimal size of a black hole. The difference\nfrom the previous works [19, 20, 21] mainly comes from the local Tolman temperature\nwhereas the global temperature has been used in the thermodynamic analysis so far. So,\nin Sec. 2, we shall obtain the local Tolman temperature in this SGUP and then calculate\nthe thermodynamic local quantities compatible with the local temperature related to the\nsize of a cavity. The local entropy, which is consistent with the thermodynamic first law,\nwill be also derived. In Sec. 3, we will take the limit of L \u2192 \u221e called the GUP case and\ninvestigate the thermodynamics and the stability of the black hole which have not been\ndiscussed in earlier works. In Sec. 4, when L is finite, thermodynamic analysis will be done.\nFinally, we draw some discussions in Sec. 5.\n\n2. Thermodynamic quantities in SGUP\nThe thermodynamic quantities will be defined in a cavity, which means that we have to\nconsider the local temperature based on the SGUP. It seems to be plausible to consider the\nlocal temperature rather than the Hawking temperature in the cavity. For this purpose,\nwe solve Eq. (1.2) for the momentum uncertainty in terms of the position uncertainty [19]\ns\n!\n4l2\n\u2206x\n4l2\n\u2206p\n= 2 1\u00b1 1\u2212 2 \u2212\n,\n(2.1)\n~\n2l\nL\n(\u2206x)2\nand putting \u2206x = 2M , we identify the emitted photon energy with the black hole temperature up to a calibration factor so that\n!\nr\nl2\n4l2\nM\n1\u2212 1\u2212 2 \u2212 2 ,\n(2.2)\nTSGU P =\n4\u03c0l2\nL\nM\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n\fwhere we set ~ = G = 1 for simplicity. We assume on the basis of thermodynamic\nconsistency that the emitted photons have a thermal black body spectrum. The remainder\nof our work depends upon this assumption. If we consider a large black hole(l/M \u226a 1)\nwith M \u226a L, then the modified temperature, in the leading order, goes to the well-known\nHawking temperature when we choose the negative sign. So, the limiting case of l \u2192 0\nand L \u2192 \u221e is well-defined. If we set L . M , then it gives a correction to the Hawking\ntemperature, TSGU P \u2248 1/(8\u03c0M ) + M/(2\u03c0L2 ).\nNow, the partition function can be written as Z = exp(\u2212I) = exp(\u2212\u03b2F ), where I,\n\u03b2, and F are the first-order Euclidean Einstein action, the inverse of temperature T , and\nthe free energy of system in the cavity of the finite radius. The Euclidean action with a\nsubtraction term is defined by\nI = I1 \u2212 I0 ,\n(2.3)\nwhere\nI1 = \u2212\n\n1\n16\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n1\n\u221a\nd4 x g R +\n8\u03c0\n\nI\n\n\u221a\nd3 x \u03b3K.\n\n(2.4)\n\nHere, K is the trace of the extrinsic curvature tensor Kij of the boundary S 1 \u00d7 S 2 of\nr = R = const. and \u03b3ij is its induced three-metric. The line element of a Schwarzschild\nblack hole is\nds2E = f d\u03c4 2 + f \u22121 dr 2 + r 2 d\u03b8 2 + r 2 sin2 \u03b8 2 d\u03c62 ,\n(2.5)\nwhere f (r) = 1 \u2212 2M/r and \u03c4 is the Euclidean time. The period of the Euclidean time is\n\u22121\n1\n\u03b2SGU P = TSGU\nP , and then the proper length of the S of the boundary is\n\u03b2=T\n\n\u22121\n\n=\n\nZ\n\n\u03b2SGU P\n0\n\np\n\u221a\nd\u03c4 g\u03c4 \u03c4 = \u03b2SGU P f (R).\n\n(2.6)\n\np\np\n\u221a\n\u221a\nSince \u03b3 and K are explicitly calculated as \u03b3 = R2 sin \u03b8 f (R), K = \u22122 f (R)/R \u2212\np\nM/R2 f (R) at the boundary, and I1 becomes\n\u0013\n\u0012\n3\nM \u2212R .\n(2.7)\nI1 = \u03b2SGU P\n2\nOn the other hand, I0 is evaluated for a flat four-metric with boundary S 1 \u00d7 S 2 . In this\n\u221a\ncase, the period of the Euclidean time is \u03b2 and we have \u03b3 = R2 sin \u03b8 and K = \u22122/R,\nwhich yields I0 = \u2212\u03b2R. This subtraction term normalizes the thermal energy to zero for\nthe Schwarzschild geometry with M = 0 and has no effect on the other physical quantities.\nCombining these two terms, the Euclidean action becomes\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03b2\n3\nI = \u03b2R + p\nM \u2212R .\n(2.8)\nf (R) 2\n\nFrom Eqs. (2.2) and (2.6), the local temperature measured on the boundary in a\nthermal equilibrium is\n!\u0012\nr\n\u0013 1\nl2\n4l2\n2M \u2212 2\nM\n1\u2212 1\u2212 2 \u2212 2\n,\n(2.9)\n1\u2212\nT =\n4\u03c0l2\nL\nM\nR\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\n\fEntropy-Mass Graph\nS\n\nM\nM0\n\nMc\n\nR\n2\n\nFigure 1: Three entropies are plotted for the case of L = 20 and l = 1/5 (SGUP; thick solid line),\nL \u2192 \u221e and l = 1/2 (GUP; thin solid line), and L \u2192 \u221e and l = 0p(HUP; dashed line). Each\nentropy becomes zero at the corresponding minimal masses M0 = l/ 1 \u2212 4l2 /L2 , l, and 0. The\nthree points near the origin in the horizontal axis represent the minimal mass for HUP, SGUP, and\nGUP cases from the left, respectively.\n\nwhich is nothing but the Tolman temperature with the redshift factor. The interesting\npoint to distinguish from the conventional Tolman temperature is that M in Eq. (2.9) is\np\nbounded and all its value lies between l/ 1 \u2212 4l2 /L2 < M < R/2. Even at the minimal\np\np\nblack hole, the temperature is finite T = 1/4\u03c0l 1 \u2212 4l2 /L2 for M = l/ 1 \u2212 4l2 /L2 while\nit is divergent for M = 0 in the conventional Tolman temperature.\nSince the area of S 2 of the boundary is A = 4\u03c0R2 , the total thermodynamic internal\nenergy within the boundary R becomes\nr\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0014\n\u0015\n2M 1 \u2212 \u03b5 \u2212 r0 /R\n\u2202I\nE=\n=R\u2212R 1\u2212\n,\n(2.10)\n\u2202\u03b2 A\nR 1 \u2212 \u03b5 \u2212 rc /R\nwhere \u03b5 = 4(M/L)2 (1 \u2212 4l2 /L2 ), r0 = (3M/2)(1 \u2212 4l2 /L2 + \u03b1), rc = M (2 \u2212 \u03b5 \u2212 4l2 /L2 + \u03b1),\np\np\nand \u03b1 = 1 \u2212 4l2 /L2 \u2212 l2 /M 2 . In the finite R, E \u2248 R \u2212 R(1 \u2212 3M/2R)/ 1 \u2212 2M/R\np\nfor which M goes to l/ 1 \u2212 4l2 /L2 and E \u2248 2M as M goes to R/2, respectively. What\nthe nonvanishing black hole mass even in this minimal black hole means is that there is a\npositive definite smallest energy corresponding to a remnant. The thermodynamic energy is\nsingular at rc = R(1\u2212\u03b5) where this point corresponds to the critical mass Mc \u2261 M |\u2202T /\u2202M =0 ,\non which the temperature goes to the critical temperature Tc \u2261 T |M =Mc . Note that below\nthe critical temperature, no black hole exists.\nFrom the free energy relation, F = E \u2212 T S, the black hole entropy is explicitly written\nas\n\u0012\n\u0013\n4l2\n1 \u2212 3M/R\n2\nS = \u03b2E \u2212 I = 2\u03c0M \u03b1 1 \u2212 2 + \u03b1\n,\n(2.11)\nL\n1 \u2212 \u03b5 \u2212 rc /R\nwhere we used Eqs.

Note that it can be reduced to the well-known\narea law S = 4\u03c0M 2 for l \u2192 0 and L \u2192 \u221e which is independent of the size of the cavity\nso that it suggests that the black hole entropy is independent of the asymptotic behavior\nof the gravitational field and matter fields.

The crucial difference between them comes near the end state of\nthe black hole, and the minimal length prevents the black hole from the total evaporation [l = 1,\nR = 20 : Mc \u2248 6.69171, Tc \u2248 0.010396, T0 \u2248 0.083882].\n\nthen the entropy is related to not only the minimal length but also the boundary through\nthe cavity size. Apparently, the area law is no longer hold, but it can be easily proved\nthat the thermodynamic first law, dE = T dS, is automatically satisfied for fixed A. It is\ninteresting to note that the entropy of the minimal black hole is zero which means that\np\nthe minimal black hole state whose mass is M = l/ 1 \u2212 4l2 /L2 can be a single state at\nthe end of the black hole evaporation. We plotted the entropies which correspond to HUP,\nGUP, and SGUP in Fig. 1.\n\n3. GUP case of L \u2192 \u221e\nThe thermodynamic stability of the black hole can be studied in terms of the heat capacity\nin the GUP limit. For this purpose, we consider a large L limit of L \u2192 \u221e, so that the\ntemperature (2.9) is reduced to\nM\nT =\n4\u03c0l2\n\n1\u2212\n\nr\n\nl2\n1\u2212 2\nM\n\n!\u0012\n\n2M\n1\u2212\nR\n\n\u0013\u2212 1\n2\n\n.\n\n(3.1)\n\nIn the conventional analysis with a cavity, the behavior of temperature of a small black\nhole looks similar to that of the large black hole since the small black hole has the small\nhorizon radius compared to the size of the cavity so that its temperature gets large as in\nthe HUP case, while the large black hole which is comparable to the size of the cavity gives\na high temperature due to the redshift factor since the local observer is almost near the\nhorizon. However, in the present calculations based on the GUP, the black hole does not\ncompletely evaporate, in other words, the temperature of the small black hole is not so\nhigh because of the cutoff.\nAs seen in Fig. 2, there are no black hole states for T < Tc , and both small and large\n\u0011\u22121\n\u0010\np\n, while\nblack hole can exist within Tc < T < T0 where T0 = T |M =l = 4\u03c0l 1 \u2212 2l/R\n\n\u20135\u2013\n\n\fHeat Capacity\nCA\n\nM\n\n{\n\nR\n\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\n2\n\nMc\n\nFigure 3: The dotted and the solid line show the behaviors of heat capacities based on the HUP and\nGUP, respectively.

Note that there is a forbidden\nregion between 0 < M < l, which tells us that there is no small black hole whose mass is\nless than the minimal length dimension. On the other hand, it is possible to obtain the\nminimal black hole of M = l in contrast to the conventional thermodynamical analysis.\nTo study the thermodynamic stability of a black hole, one can consider the heat capacity at a constant surface, which is defined by\nCA \u2261\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2202E\n\u2202T\n\n\u0013\n\nA\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0010\nrc \u00112\n2M (1 \u2212 r\u2212 /R)(1 \u2212 r+ /R)\n= \u22122\u03c0M 1 \u2212\n,\n1\u2212\nM\nR\n(1 \u2212 rc /R)3\n2\n\n(3.2)\n\n\u221a\nwhere the constants are r\u00b1 = a \u00b1 a2 \u2212 b, a = (M 3 /l2 )[1 + 3l2 /(2M 2 ) \u2212 (1 \u2212 l2 /M 2 )3/2 ],\nand b = 9M 2 [1 \u2212 l2 /(3M 2 )], respectively. If we take the limit of l \u2192 0, it is naturally\nreduced to the result of the HUP [6],\nHUP\nCA\n\n= \u22128\u03c0M\n\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n2M\n1\u2212\nR\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\n3M\n1\u2212\nR\n\n\u0013\u22121\n\n,\n\n(3.3)\n\nwhich is positive for R/3 < M < R/2 while it is negative for 0 < M < R/3. Moreover, it\nis singular at M \u2192 Mc = R/3. In this case, the small black hole of M \u2192 0 is unstable to\ndecay into either into pure thermal radiation or to a large black hole. In our generalized\ncase as shown in Fig. 3, there are two different aspects from the HUP case. First, the\ncritical behavior of the heat capacity near the critical mass is more complicated so that\nwe can not obtain the definite criteria for the stability for M < Mc or M > Mc . For\nM < Mc (M > Mc ), there may exist a stable(unstable) region near the critical mass while\nmost part of the region is unstable (stable). Secondly, the minimal black hole exists in our\nanalysis so that the black hole can not evaporate completely. For M \u2192 l in Eq. (3.2), the\nheat capacity of the minimal black hole is CA \u2248 \u22122\u03c0l2 , where the horizon of the black\nhole is the same with the minimal length, rH = 2M = 2l = \u2206xmin .\n\n\u20136\u2013\n\n\fTemperature-Mass Graph\nT\n\nT0\n\nTc\nM0\n\nMc\n\nR\n2\n\nM\n\nFigure 4: The solid line describes the behavior of the temperature for the finite L, which gives\nan additional correction mainly to the large black hole. Eventually, the temperature are shifted\nup due to the two uncertainty constants l and L.

Another case of finite L\nIn this section, we are now in a position to study how the SGUP affects the thermodynamic\nquantities by assuming L to be finite, while, in the previous section, we have studied the\nGUP limit of L \u2192 \u221e. As seen in Fig. 4, the finite L gives a temperature correction mainly\nto the large mass black hole comparable to the cavity size, M \u223c R/2. Note that the minimal\nblack hole mass M0 is larger than that of GUP so that it gives higher temperature.\nWe calculate the heat capacity at a constant surface to see whether a black hole in a\ncavity is stable or not, which is now given by\n\u00132 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2M (A \u2212 2B/R + C/R2 )\n4l2\n2\n1\u2212\n,\n(4.1)\nCA = \u22122\u03c0M 1 \u2212 2 + \u03b1\nL\nR\n(1 \u2212 \u03b5 \u2212 rc /R)3\nwhere the constants are A = (1 \u2212 4l2 /L2 )(1 + 4\u03b1M 2 /L2 ), B = (M 3 /l2 )[(1 \u2212 4l2 /L2 )(1 \u2212\n\u03b5 + 4(l/L)2 (1 + 5\u03b1/2)) + (3/2 \u2212 10l2 /L2 )l2 /M 2 \u2212 \u03b13 (1 \u2212 \u03b5)], and C = 9M 2 (1 \u2212 4l2 /L2 \u2212\nl2 /3M 2 )(1 + 4\u03b1M 2 /L2 ), respectively. If we take the limit of L \u2192 \u221e, then it naturally\nrecovers the heat capacity in Eq. (3.2). On the other hand, as for the other extreme limit\nof l \u2192 0 keeping L to be finite, the heat capacity becomes\n\u0013\u0014\n\u0013\u0015\u22121\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0012\nC2\n4M 2 M\n2B\n4M 2\n2M\n2\n,\n(4.2)\n+ 2\n1\u2212 2 \u2212\nA\u2212\n3\u2212 2\nCA = \u22128\u03c0M 1 \u2212\nR\nR\nR\nL\nR\nL\n\nwhere A \u2192 (1 + 4M 2 /L2 ), B \u2192 M (3 + 10M 2 /L2 \u2212 8M 4 /L4 ), and C \u2192 9M 2 (1 + 4M 2 /L2 ).\nOf course, the heat capacity (3.3) of the HUP case can be derived for L \u2192 \u221e and l \u2192 0.\nIn Fig. 5, the complicated behavior of the heat capacity near the critical mass disappears\nand resembles the behavior of the heat capacity of HUP. Therefore, the whole profile of\nthe heat capacity for the finite L case is very similar to that of the HUP case. In fact, the\ncomplicated behavior of the heat capacity near the critical mass appears again when both\nL \u226b 1/l and L \u226b R are satisfied. The exact critical condition exists but it is too lengthy\nto write down.\n\n\u20137\u2013\n\n\fHeat Capacity-Mass Graph\nCA\n\nM\nM0\n\nMc\n\nR\n2\n\nFigure 5: The heat capacity is singular at the critical mass and it is ill-defined when the mass is less\nthan the minimal mass. It also shows that it is negative for M < Mc while it is positive for M > Mc .\nThis figure shows that it is critically different from that of the GUP case. The heat capacity goes\nto CA \u2248 \u22122\u03c0M02 (1 \u2212 3M0 /R)/(1 \u2212 2M0 /R) as M \u2192 M0 and zero as M \u2192 R/2.

Discussion\nWe have studied thermodynamic quantities and the stability of the black hole in a cavity\nbased on the extended GUP called symmetric GUP whose limits are well defined such as\nL \u2192 \u221e and l \u2192 0. In particular, following the Euclidean action formalism in a cavity, the\nTolman temperature has been used in deriving the heat capacity, and it gives the consistent\nthermodynamic first law along with the appropriate energy and the entropy. Moreover,\nthis entropy can not be written in the form of the area, whereas it recovers the area law\nwhen we take the HUP limit of L \u2192 \u221e and l \u2192 0. The entropy is usually proportional to\nthe area since it is independent of the asymptotic behavior of the gravitational field and\nmatter fields; however, it depends on two uncertainty parameters, L and l in our case.\nIn the HUP case, a small black hole in unstable equilibrium over the critical temperature may decay either into pure thermal radiation or to a large black hole. In the GUP case,\nthe off-shell free energy [23, 24, 25] can be defined by Foffsell = E \u2212 T S where Eqs. (2.10)\nand (2.11) are used with the arbitrary temperature. It shows that the small black hole in\nthe unstable equilibrium may decay into the minimal black hole or a larger stable black\nhole, however, whose final mass should be smaller than the critical mass in Fig. 2. From\nthe extrema condition of the free energy, (dFoffshell /dM )R = 0, it can be shown that the\nmass of the small unstable black hole can not exceed the critical mass, because the off-shell\nfree energy (potential) is singular at the critical mass due to the definition of the GUP\ntemperature of Eq. (2.9). If the initial mass of the black hole is larger than the critical\nmass, then it may decay into a really large black hole whose mass is nearly R/2, which is\nalso a big difference from the HUP case.\nIn fact, there remains further issues in connection with GUP(SGUP) calculations.\nFirst, the Hawking temperature modified by the GUP in Ref. [19] should be confirmed\nby other independent methods. One of them may be a scattering method in connection\n\n\u20138\u2013\n\n\fwith the grey-body factor. Second, the resulting modified temperature (2.2) subject to\nthe GUP(SGUP) should be consistent with the metric giving the well-known Hawking\ntemperature through the periodicity of the Euclideanized metric. It means that we have to\nconsider the back reaction of the geometry properly. We hope these issues will be addressed\nelsewhere.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported by the Sogang Research Grant, 20071063 (2007) and the Science\nResearch Center Program of the Korea Science and Engineering Foundation through the\nCenter for Quantum Spacetime (CQUeST) of Sogang University with grant number R112005-021.\n\nReferences\n[1] S.
