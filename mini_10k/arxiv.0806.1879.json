In this paper we show that two skew diagrams \u03bb/\u03bc and \u03b1/\u03b2 can\nrepresent the same multiplicity free skew character [\u03bb/\u03bc] = [\u03b1/\u03b2] only in the\nthe trivial cases when \u03bb/\u03bc and \u03b1/\u03b2 are the same up to translation or rotation\nor if \u03bb = \u03b1 is a staircase partition \u03bb = (l, l \u2212 1, . . . , 2, 1) and \u03bb/\u03bc and \u03b1/\u03b2 are\nconjugate of each other.\n\n1. Introduction\nThe question under which circumstances two different skew diagrams \u03bb/\u03bc and\n\u03b1/\u03b2 give rise to the same skew character [\u03bb/\u03bc] = [\u03b1/\u03b2] has lately received much\nattention and is by [Gut1, Theorem 4.2] equivalent to the question under which\ncircumstances two products of Schubert classes \u03c3\u03b11 * \u03c3\u03b12 and \u03c3\u03b21 * \u03c3\u03b22 are equal.\nTrivial cases for equality of skew characters [\u03bb/\u03bc] = [\u03b1/\u03b2] are given if the skew\ndiagrams \u03bb/\u03bc and \u03b1/\u03b2 are the same up to translation or rotation.\nIn [RSW] and later in [MW] a method for constructing skew diagrams with\nnontrivial equality of their corresponding skew characters was presented. The fact\nthat for a staircase partition \u03bb = (l, l \u2212 1, . . . , 2, 1) the skew diagram \u03bb/\u03bc and its\nconjugate (\u03bb/\u03bc)\u2032 give rise to the same skew character was proved in [RSW, Theorem\n7.32].\nOn the other hand new necessary conditions for two skew diagrams \u03bb/\u03bc and\n\u03b1/\u03b2 to give rise to the same skew character have been given recently in [McN] and\n[Gut2].\nIn [Gut1] we classified the skew diagrams \u03bb/\u03bc whose corresponding skew character\n[\u03bb/\u03bc] is multiplicity free which means that in the decomposition [\u03bb/\u03bc] =\nP\nc(\u03bb; \u03bd, \u03bc)[\u03bd] all coefficients c(\u03bb; \u03bd, \u03bc) are either 0 or 1.\nUsing algebraic arguments Reiner et al. showed in [RSW] that equality of [\u03bb/\u03bc] =\n[\u03b1/\u03b2] when \u03bb/\u03bc decays into partitions is only possible in the trivial cases.\nWe will examine in this paper the case when \u03bb/\u03bc and \u03b1/\u03b2 are connected skew\ndiagrams and [\u03bb/\u03bc] = [\u03b1/\u03b2] is multiplicity free. We will see that the only nontrivial\ncase for [\u03bb/\u03bc] = [\u03b1/\u03b2] is when \u03bb = \u03b1 is a staircase partition and additionally\n\u03bb/\u03bc = (\u03b1/\u03b2)\u2032 .\n2. Notation and Littlewood-Richardson-Symmetries\nWe mostly follow the standard notation in [Sag] or [Sta]. A partition \u03bb =\n(\u03bb1 , \u03bb2 , . . . , \u03bbl ) is a weakly decreasing sequence of non-negative integers where only\nfinitely many of the \u03bbi are positive. We regard two partitions as the same if they\ndiffer only by the number of trailing zeros and call the positive \u03bbi the parts of \u03bb.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 05E05,05E10,14M15,20C30.\nKey words and phrases.

GUTSCHWAGER\n\nThe length\nP is the number of positive parts and we write l(\u03bb) = l for the length and\n|\u03bb| = i \u03bbi for the sum of the parts. With a partition \u03bb we associate a diagram,\nwhich we also denote by \u03bb, containing \u03bbi left-justified boxes in the i-th row and we\nuse matrix-style coordinates to refer to the boxes.\nDefinition 2.1. We will call a partition \u03bb with n different parts a dp = n partition\nor write dp(\u03bb) = n.\nOn the set of partitions we define the lexicographic order in the following way.\nFor two partitions \u03bb, \u03bc, we say \u03bb < \u03bc if there is an i with \u03bbi < \u03bci and for j < i we\nhave \u03bbj = \u03bcj .\nThe conjugate \u03bb\u2032 of \u03bb is the diagram which has \u03bbi boxes in the i-th column.\nFor \u03bc \u2286 \u03bb we define the skew diagram \u03bb/\u03bc as the difference of the diagrams \u03bb and\n\u03bc defined as the difference of the set of the boxes. Rotation of \u03bb/\u03bc by 180\u25e6 yields\na skew diagram (\u03bb/\u03bc)\u25e6 which is well defined up to translation. A skew tableau T\nis a skew diagram in which positive integers are written into the boxes. We refer\nwith T (i, j) to the entry in box (i, j). A semistandard tableau of shape \u03bb/\u03bc is a\nfilling of \u03bb/\u03bc with positive integers such that the following expressions hold for all\n(i, j) for which they are defined: T (i, j) < T (i + 1, j) and T (i, j) \u2264 T (i, j + 1). The\ncontent of a semistandard tableau T is \u03bd = (\u03bd1 , . . .) if the number of occurrences of\nthe entry i in T is \u03bdi . The reverse row word of a tableau T is the sequence obtained\nby reading the entries of T from right to left and top to bottom starting at the\nfirst row. Such a sequence is said to be a lattice word if for all i, n \u2265 1 the number\nof occurrences of i among the first n terms is at least the number of occurrences\nof i + 1 among these terms. The Littlewood-Richardson (LR) coefficient c(\u03bb; \u03bc, \u03bd)\nequals the number of semistandard tableaux of shape \u03bb/\u03bc with content \u03bd such that\nthe reverse row word is a lattice word. We will call those tableaux LR tableaux.\nThe LR coefficients play an important role in different contexts (see [Sag] or [Sta]).\nThe irreducible characters [\u03bb] of the symmetric group Sn are naturally labeled\nby partitions \u03bb \u22a2 n. The skew character [\u03bb/\u03bc] of a skew diagram \u03bb/\u03bc is defined by\nthe LR coefficients:\nX\n[\u03bb/\u03bc] =\nc(\u03bb; \u03bc, \u03bd)[\u03bd].\n\u03bd\n\nThere are many known symmetries of the LR coefficients.\nWe have that c(\u03bb; \u03bc, \u03bd) = c(\u03bb; \u03bd, \u03bc). The translation symmetry gives [\u03bb/\u03bc] =\n[\u03b1/\u03b2] if the skew diagrams of \u03bb/\u03bc and \u03b1/\u03b2 are the same up to translation while\nrotation symmetry gives [(\u03bb/\u03bc)\u25e6 ] = [\u03bb/\u03bc]. Another well known symmetry is the\nconjugation symmetry c(\u03bb\u2032 ; \u03bc\u2032 , \u03bd \u2032 ) = c(\u03bb; \u03bc, \u03bd) .\nWe say that a skew diagram D decays into the disconnected skew diagrams A\nand B if no box of A (viewed as boxes in D) is in the same row or column as a box\nof B. We write D = A \u2297 B if D decays into A and B. A skew diagram is connected\nif it does not decay.\nA skew character whose skew diagram D decays into disconnected (skew) diagrams A, B is equivalent to the product of the characters of the disconnected\ndiagrams induced to a larger symmetric group. We have\nS\n\n[D] = ([A] \u00d7 [B]) \u2191Sn+m\n=: [A] \u2297 [B]\nn \u00d7Sm\nwith |A| = n, |B| = m. If D = \u03bb/\u03bc and A, B are proper partitions \u03b1, \u03b2 we have:\nX\nX\n[\u03bb/\u03bc] =\nc(\u03bb; \u03bc, \u03bd)[\u03bd] =\nc(\u03bd; \u03b1, \u03b2)[\u03bd] = [\u03b1] \u2297 [\u03b2].\n\u03bd\n\n\u03bd\n\n\fEQUALITY OF MULTIPLICITY FREE SKEW CHARACTERS\n\n3\n\nThe product of two Schubert classes \u03c3\u03b1 , \u03c3\u03b2 in the cohomology ring\nH \u2217 (Gr(l, Cn ), Z) of the Grassmannian Gr(l, Cn ) of l-dimensional subspaces of Cn\nis given by:\nX\n\u03c3\u03b1 * \u03c3\u03b2 =\nc(\u03bd; \u03b1, \u03b2)\u03c3\u03bd .\n\u03bd\u2286((n\u2212l)l )\n\nIn [Gut1, Section4] we established a close connection between the Schubert product and skew characters. To use this relation later on we define the Schubert product\nfor characters in the obvious way as a restriction of the ordinary product:\nX\n[\u03b1] \u22c6(kl ) [\u03b2] :=\nc(\u03bd; \u03b1, \u03b2)[\u03bd].\n\u03bd\u2286(kl )\n\nSince translation of \u03bb/\u03bc does not change the corresponding skew character, we\nmay assume that \u03bci < \u03bbi , \u03bci \u2264 \u03bbi+1 for each 1 \u2264 i \u2264 l(\u03bb), which means that \u03bb/\u03bc\ndoesn't have empty rows or columns. We call such a skew diagram a basic skew\ndiagram.\nFor a basic skew diagram \u03bb/\u03bc we define two lattice paths from the lower left\ncorner to the upper right corner. The outer lattice path starts to the right, follows\nthe shape of \u03bb and ends upwards in the corner, while the inner lattice path starts\nupwards, follows the shape of \u03bc and ends with a segment to the right. With sin we\nrefer to the length of the shortest straight segment of the inner lattice path while\nsout is the length of the shortest straight segment of the outer lattice path.\nIn [Gut1, Theorem 3.8] we classified the multiplicity free skew characters.\nTheorem 2.2 ([Gut1, Theorem 3.8]). Let \u03bb/\u03bc be a basic skew diagram which is\nneither a partition nor a rotated partition. Then [\u03bb/\u03bc] is multiplicity free if and\nonly if up to rotation of \u03bb/\u03bc \u03bc is a rectangle and additionally one of the following\nconditions holds:\n(1) sin = 1\n(2) sin = 2 and \u03bb is a dp = 3 partition\n(3) \u03bb is a dp = 3 partition and sout = 1\n(4) \u03bb is a dp = 2 partition.\n3. Equality of skew characters\n3.1. Notation and Preliminary. In this section we prove that two connected\nskew diagrams \u03bb/\u03bc, \u03b1/\u03b2 which give rise to the same multiplicity free skew character\nhave (up to translation or rotation) to be the same or both \u03bb and \u03b1 are the same\nstaircase partition \u03bb = \u03b1 = (n, n \u2212 1, n \u2212 2, . . . , 2, 1) and additionally \u03bc is the\nconjugate of \u03b2: \u03bc = \u03b2 \u2032 .\nReiner et al. proved in [RSW, Section 6] the following, using the Jacobi-Trudi\ndeterminant but no LR combinatorics:\nLemma 3.1 ([RSW, Section 6]). Let A1 and A2 be skew diagrams and A1 decay\ninto partitions. Let [A1 ] = [A2 ].\nThen the equality is trivial i.e. up to translation or rotation A1 and A2 are the\nsame.\nHere translation or rotation does not require the entire skew diagram to be translated or rotated but also includes the case when the partitions into which A1 decays\nare translated or rotated independent of each other.\n\n\f4\n\nC. GUTSCHWAGER\n\nWe will use this lemma always to argue that A1 = \u03b3 \u2297 \u03b4 with partitions \u03b3, \u03b4 and\n[A ] = [A2 ] requires A2 = \u03b3 \u2297 \u03b4.\nTo exclude the trivial cases for [\u03bb/\u03bc] = [\u03b1/\u03b2] we will in the following always\nassume that \u03bc is a rectangle and both \u03bb/\u03bc and \u03b1/\u03b2 are basic skew diagrams.\nFurthermore we will use the following\nP notation:\n\u03bb = (\u03bbl11 , \u03bbl22 , . . .) with l = l(\u03bb) = i li and \u03bbi > \u03bbi+1 , \u03bc = (\u03bcm\n1 ),\nP\n\u03b1 = (\u03b1a1 1 , \u03b1a2 2 , . . .) with a = l(\u03b1) = i ai and \u03b1i > \u03b1i+1 , \u03b2 = (\u03b21b ).\nBefore we begin with the proofs we state some additional facts.\nRecall that the parts of a skew diagram A = \u03b3/\u03b4 are the numbers \u03b3i \u2212 \u03b4i\n(1 \u2264 i \u2264 l(\u03b3)) and so are the number of boxes in the rows of A. Furthermore\nthe heights of a skew diagram A are the number of boxes in the columns of A\nand so are the parts of the conjugated skew diagram. For example the skew dia1\n\ngram A = (72 , 5, 3, 2)/(4, 22, 1) =\n\nhas the parts 3, 5, 3, 2, 2 and heights\n\n1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 2.\nIt is known, that skew diagrams which give rise to the same skew character have\nto have the same parts and heights in the same quantity. This follows from the\nfact, that the LR tableau of the skew diagram A obtained by filling every column\nwith the entries 1 to the height of the column (e.g.\n\n1 1\n1 2\n1 1 2\n1 2 2\n2 3 3\n\n) has as content \u03bd\n\nthe lexicographic biggest partition whose corresponding character [\u03bd] appears in\nthe decomposition of [A]. Clearly this is the partition obtained by reordering the\nheights of A to form a partition. So skew diagrams which give rise to the same skew\ncharacter have to have the same heights in the same quantity and by conjugation\nthe same holds true for the parts.\nIn the following we will assume that [\u03bb/\u03bc] = [\u03b1/\u03b2]. Since we need the same\nnumber of rows and columns in \u03bb/\u03bc and \u03b1/\u03b2 we need \u03bb1 = \u03b11 and a = l if we\nassume [\u03bb/\u03bc] = [\u03b1/\u03b2].\nIf we remove from an LR tableau of shape \u03bb/\u03bc containing \u03bb1 entries 1 all the\nboxes with entry 1 and replace every entry i > 1 by i \u2212 1 we obtain an LR tableau\nof a shape which is obtained from \u03bb/\u03bc by removing the top box from every column.\nThis gives us a 1 \u2212 1 relation between the characters [\u03bd] \u2208 [\u03bb/\u03bc] with maximal\nfirst part \u03bd1 = \u03bb1 and arbitrary characters [\u03be] \u2208 [\u03bb\u0302/\u03bc] with \u03bb\u0302/\u03bc the skew diagram\nobtained by removing the top boxes in every column of \u03bb/\u03bc so \u03bb\u0302 = (\u03bbl11 \u22121 , \u03bbl22 , . . .)\nand the 1 \u2212 1 relation is given by \u03bei = \u03bdi+1 . So we have the following lemma:\nLemma 3.2. Let [\u03bb/\u03bc] = [\u03b1/\u03b2].\nLet \u03bb\u0302/\u03bc (resp. \u03b1\u0302/\u03b2) be the skew diagram obtained from \u03bb/\u03bc (resp. \u03b1/\u03b2) by\nremoving the top i boxes from every column of \u03bb/\u03bc (resp. \u03b1/\u03b2). Let \u03bb\u0303/\u03bc (resp.\n\u03b1\u0303/\u03b2) be the skew diagram obtained from \u03bb/\u03bc (resp. \u03b1/\u03b2) by removing in every row\nof \u03bb/\u03bc (resp. \u03b1/\u03b2) the left i boxes.\nThen [\u03bb\u0302/\u03bc] = [\u03b1\u0302/\u03b2] and [\u03bb\u0303/\u03bc] = [\u03b1\u0303/\u03b2].\nProof. [\u03bb\u0302/\u03bc] = [\u03b1\u0302/\u03b2] follows from the above 1 \u2212 1 relation. [\u03bb\u0303/\u03bc] = [\u03b1\u0303/\u03b2] follows\nthen by conjugation symmetry.\n\u0003\nIn most cases we remove the boxes until \u03bb\u0302/\u03bc decays into two disconnected skew\ndiagrams so that we can use Lemma 3.1.\n\n\fEQUALITY OF MULTIPLICITY FREE SKEW CHARACTERS\n\n5\n\nIf we say in the following that we remove lj resp. \u03bbi boxes from the top resp.\nleft of \u03bb/\u03bc we always mean that we remove in every column lj resp. in every row\n\u03bbi boxes.\nIn [Gut1] we proved the following:\nTheorem 3.3 ([Gut1, Theorem 4.2]). Let \u03bc, \u03bb be partitions with \u03bc \u2286 \u03bb \u2286 (k l ) with\nsome fixed integers k, l. Set \u03bb\u22121 = (k l )/\u03bb.\nThen: The coefficient of [\u03b1] in [\u03bb/\u03bc] equals the coefficient of [\u03b1\u22121 ] = [(k l )/\u03b1] in\n[\u03bc] \u22c6(kl ) [\u03bb\u22121 ].\nFor k \u2265 \u03bc1 + \u03bd1 , l \u2265 l(\u03bc) + l(\u03bd) the Schubert product [\u03bc] \u22c6(kl ) [\u03bd] is the ordinary\nproduct [\u03bc] \u2297 [\u03bd].\nLemma 3.4. Let [A1 ] = [A2 ] with A1 being an arbitrary skew diagram A1 = \u03b3/\u03b4\nhaving a part \u03b31 and a height l(\u03b3) (see Figure 1).\nThen A1 = A2 or A1 = (A2 )\u25e6 .\nProof. Since A1 and A2 have the same heights and parts we have also the part \u03b3 1\nand the height l(\u03b3) in A2 . The lemma follows now from Lemma 3.1 and Theorem 3.3.\n\u03b4\n\nl(\u03b3)\n\nA1 :\n\u03b31\n\n\u03b3 \u22121\n\nFigure 1. Lemma 3.4: A1\n\u0003\n3.2. Proofs. The proof is arranged as follows. We first prove that [\u03bb/\u03bc] = [\u03b1/\u03b2]\nand dp(\u03bb) = 2 requires \u03bb/\u03bc = \u03b1/\u03b2 or \u03bb/\u03bc = (\u03b1/\u03b2)\u25e6 . Next we prove that [\u03bb/\u03bc] =\n[\u03b1/\u03b2] and dp(\u03bb) = 3 requires dp(\u03b1) = 3. Then we prove that \u03bb/\u03bc = \u03b1/\u03b2 is required\nif both \u03bb and \u03b1 are dp = 3 partitions and [\u03bb/\u03bc] = [\u03b1/\u03b2].\nThen we examine the cases when both \u03bb and \u03b1 have more than 3 different parts\nand [\u03bb/\u03bc] = [\u03b1/\u03b2] is multiplicity free.\nTheorem 3.5. Let [\u03bb/\u03bc] = [\u03b1/\u03b2] and \u03bb be a dp = 2 partition.\nThen \u03b1 is also a dp = 2 partition and \u03b1/\u03b2 = \u03bb/\u03bc or \u03b1/\u03b2 = (\u03bb/\u03bc)\u25e6 .\nProof. We will assume that \u03b1 has n \u2265 2 different parts, dp(\u03b1) = n \u2265 2, and show\nfirst that n = 2.\nCase 1: \u03bb2 > \u03bc1 , l1 > m. This case is covered by Lemma 3.4.\nSo we have either Case 2: l1 \u2264 m or Case 3: \u03bb2 \u2264 \u03bc1 . We cannot have both\nat the same time without \u03bb/\u03bc decaying into two disconnected rectangles. It is\nsufficient to examine only the Case 2 since Case 3 follows then by conjugation\nsymmetry.\nCase 2: l1 \u2264 m, \u03bb2 > \u03bc1 . By comparing the heights of length l and the parts \u03bb1\nin \u03bb/\u03bc and \u03b1/\u03b2 we get a1 \u2264 b, \u03b1n > \u03b21 .\n\n\f6\n\nC.

Since we do not have heights l and parts \u03bb1 in\n\u03bb/\u03bc we also need a1 \u2264 b, \u03b13 \u2264 \u03b21 .\nFor \u03bb/\u03bc to be connected we need \u03bb2 > \u03bc1 , l1 + l2 > m.\nCase 1.1: l1 > l1 + l2 \u2212 m and Case 1.2: \u03bb3 > \u03bb2 \u2212 \u03bc1 are related by conjugation\nsymmetry so it is sufficient to consider only Case 1.1.\nCase 1.1: l1 > l1 + l2 \u2212 m.\nRemoving l1 + l2 \u2212 m boxes from the top of \u03bb/\u03bc gives:\n\u03bb\u0302/\u03bc = (\u03bbl33 ) \u2297 ((\u03bb1 \u2212 \u03bc1 )m\u2212l2 , (\u03bb2 \u2212 \u03bc1 )l2 ).\nIf we remove only l1 + l2 \u2212 m \u2212 1 boxes from the top of \u03bb/\u03bc the remaining skew\ndiagram does not decay, so we need l1 + l2 \u2212 m = a1 + a2 \u2212 b, b > a2 and removing\na1 + a2 \u2212 b boxes from the top of \u03b1/\u03b2 gives then:\n\u03b1\u0302/\u03b2 = (\u03b1a3 3 ) \u2297 ((\u03bb1 \u2212 \u03b21 )b\u2212a2 , (\u03b12 \u2212 \u03b21 )a2 ).\nThis gives \u03bb/\u03bc = \u03b1/\u03b2.\nCase 1.3: l1 \u2264 l1 + l2 \u2212 m \u21d4 m \u2264 l2 , \u03bb3 \u2264 \u03bb2 \u2212 \u03bc1 .\nRemoving l1 boxes from the top of \u03bb/\u03bc removes in total l1 * \u03bb1 boxes and gives\na skew diagram which either decays into two disconnected rectangles (for l1 =\nl1 + l2 \u2212 m) or is (\u03bbl22 , \u03bbl33 )/\u03bc (for l1 < l1 + l2 \u2212 m). We need a1 \u2264 l1 because\nremoving l1 boxes from the top of \u03b1/\u03b2 must either yield a decaying skew diagram\nor a dp = 2 partition with a rectangle removed. But since removing the top l1 boxes\nof \u03b1/\u03b2 has to remove in total l1 * \u03bb1 boxes we need also a1 \u2265 l1 and so a1 = l1 .\nRemoving l1 + l2 \u2212 m \u2212 1 boxes from the top of \u03bb/\u03bc yields a connected skew\ndiagram but removing the top l1 + l2 \u2212 m boxes yields:\n\u03bb\u0302/\u03bc = (\u03bbl33 ) \u2297 ((\u03bb2 \u2212 \u03bc1 )m ).\nSince \u03b1/\u03b2 must also decay after removing l1 + l2 \u2212 m boxes from the top but not\nafter removing less boxes we get a1 + a2 \u2212 b = l1 + l2 \u2212 m and so a2 \u2212 b = l2 \u2212 m.\nIn an analogous way by removing \u03bb3 resp. \u03bb2 \u2212 \u03bc1 boxes from the left we get\n\u03b13 = \u03bb3 and \u03b12 \u2212 \u03b21 = \u03bb2 \u2212 \u03bc1 .\nWe will first examine the Case 1.3.1: \u03bc1 6= \u03b21 and show that this gives [\u03bb/\u03bc] 6=\n[\u03b1/\u03b2]. This covers by conjugation symmetry also the Case 1.3.2: m 6= b.\nFor the following construction we only need:\n(3.7)\n\n\u03b12 \u2212 \u03b21 = \u03bb2 \u2212 \u03bc1 ,\n\na1 = l 1 ,\n\nm \u2264 l2 ,\n\nb \u2264 a2 .\n\nWithout loss of generality we may also assume that \u03bc1 < \u03b21 and set \u03b21 = \u03bc1 + n\nwhich gives \u03b12 = \u03bb2 + n.\nCase 1.3.1.1: \u03bb1 \u2212 (\u03bb2 + n) + 1 \u2264 \u03bc1 .\nWe can in \u03bb write entries 1 to l1 into the columns \u03bb2 + n to \u03bb1 which are in\ntotal \u03bb1 \u2212 (\u03bb2 + n) + 1 columns (see Figure 7). If we place the remaining entries so\nthat they obey the LR rule we get an LR filling of \u03bb with content \u03bc where the box\n(l1 , \u03bb2 + n) is filled. So there is a character [\u03bd] in [\u03bb/\u03bc] with \u03bd not containing the\nbox (l1 , \u03bb2 + n).\nIn \u03b1 there are a2 \u2265 b boxes below the box (l1 , \u03bb2 + n) = (a1 , \u03b12 ) so in every LR\nfilling of \u03b1 with content \u03b2 the box (l1 , \u03bb2 + n) remains empty. So for every character\n[\u03bd] in [\u03b1/\u03b2], \u03bd contains a box in position (l1 , \u03bb2 + n).

Now place for 1 < i < b the i above i + 1 if possible. For b \u2212 i = a3\nwe cannot place the entry i above the entry i + 1 unless there are \u03b12 \u2212 \u03b13 entries b\nin row l1 + a2 . If there are less than \u03b12 \u2212 \u03b13 entries b in row l1 + a2 we place the\nentry i in row l1 + a2 directly left to the b. If we now place \u03b21 \u2212 1 entries 1 into the\nright \u03b21 \u2212 1 columns we only get to column \u03bb1 \u2212 (\u03b21 \u2212 1) + 1 = \u03bb1 \u2212 \u03b21 + 2 \u2265 \u03bb2 + 2.\nIf we now place the remaining 1 atop of one of the entries 2 which are in row\nl1 + a2 + a3 \u2212 b + 2 (in one of the columns having in row a1 + a2 an entry b \u2212 a3\ninstead of an entry b) then the 1 is placed in row l1 + a2 + a3 \u2212 b + 1 \u2265 l1 + 2 where\nwe used a2 \u2265 b and a3 \u2265 1. Also the highest position of a 2 in this filling is in row\nl1 + a2 \u2212 b + 2 and so below row l1 + 2. So the box (l1 + 1, \u03bb2 + 1) is empty in\nthis LR filling.

Then we have:\n\u03bb\u0302/\u03bc = (\u03bb2 \u2212 \u03bc1 ) \u2297 (\u03bbl33 , \u03bbl44 , . . .)\nand\n\u03b1\u0302/\u03b2 = (\u03b12 \u2212 \u03b21 ) \u2297 (\u03b1a3 3 , \u03b1a4 4 , . . .).\nThis gives \u03bblii = \u03b1ai i for i \u2265 3 and \u03bb2 \u2212 \u03bc1 = \u03b12 \u2212 \u03b21 .\nFor \u03bc1 = \u03b21 we get \u03bb2 = \u03b12 and since we have in this case also l2 = a2 = 1 we\nget \u03bb/\u03bc = \u03b1/\u03b2.\nFor \u03bc1 6= \u03b21 we can use the construction of LR fillings following equation (3.7)\n(page 10) and get [\u03bb/\u03bc] 6= [\u03b1/\u03b2].\n\u0003\nLemma 3.9. Let \u03bb/\u03bc and \u03b1/\u03b2 be skew diagrams with \u03bc 6= (1) 6= \u03b2, m = 1 = \u03b21\nand [\u03bb/\u03bc] = [\u03b1/\u03b2].\n\n\f14\n\nC. GUTSCHWAGER\n\nThen \u03bb = (l, l \u2212 1, l \u2212 2, . . . , 2, 1) is a staircase partition and \u03bb/\u03bc is the conjugate\nof \u03b1/\u03b2, \u03b1/\u03b2 = \u03bb/\u03bc\u2032 .\nProof. Suppose l1 > 1. Then we have the part \u03bb1 l1 \u2212 1 times in \u03bb/\u03bc and so need\na1 = b + l1 \u2212 1. The smallest height in \u03bb/\u03bc is either l1 (in the case \u03bb2 \u2265 \u03bc1 ) or l1 \u2212 1\n(for \u03bb2 < \u03bc1 ). The smallest height in \u03b1/\u03b2 is either a1 = b + l1 \u2212 1 > l1 or l \u2212 b. For\n\u03bb2 \u2265 \u03bc1 this gives l \u2212 b = l1 and so l = b + l1 = a1 + 1 which means that \u03b1 has only\n2 different parts. For \u03bb2 < \u03bc1 this gives l \u2212 b = l1 \u2212 1 and so l = l1 + b \u2212 1 = a1\nwhich means that \u03b1 is a rectangle.\nSo we have l1 = 1 and since \u03bb/\u03bc does not decay we need \u03bb2 > \u03bc1 .\nIf we remove the top box of \u03bb/\u03bc and \u03b1/\u03b2 we get a connected skew diagram for\neither l2 > 1 or for \u03bb3 > \u03bc1 . Suppose we are in this case then if the new skew\ndiagrams have less than 4 different parts we can use Theorem 3.7 which then gives\nthat [\u03bb/\u03bc] 6= [\u03b1/\u03b2]. If the new skew diagram has 4 or more different parts we get\n\u03bb2 = \u03b12 , because \u03bb2 is the number of columns in the new skew diagram, and so\na1 = 1. Since we have the part \u03bb1 \u2212 1 in \u03b1/\u03b2 we need \u03bb2 = \u03bb1 \u2212 1, because we need\na the part \u03bb1 \u2212 1 also in \u03bb/\u03bc. We can repeat the above argument until the skew\ndiagram we obtain after removing the top box decays.\nSo we now assume that the skew diagrams \u03bb\u0302/\u03bc and \u03b1\u0302/\u03b2 obtained after removing\nthe top box of \u03bb/\u03bc and \u03b1/\u03b2 decay and so we need l2 = 1, \u03bb3 \u2264 \u03bc1 . If \u03bb\u0302/\u03bc decays\nwe have:\n\u03bb\u0302/\u03bc = (\u03bb2 \u2212 \u03bc1 ) \u2297 (\u03bbl33 , \u03bbl44 , . . .).\nSince \u03b1\u0302/\u03b2 must also decay we need \u03b1n = 1 and a = b + an + 1 if \u03b1/\u03b2 has n different\nparts. We then have:\n\u03b1\u0302/\u03b2 = (1an ) \u2297 ((\u03b11 \u2212 1)a1 \u22121 , (\u03b12 \u2212 1)a2 , (\u03b13 \u2212 1)a3 , . . .).\n{z\n}\n|\nfor a1 >1\n\nSince we have height 1 in \u03bb/\u03bc and the smallest height in \u03b1/\u03b2 is either a1 or\nl \u2212 b = an + 1 > 1 we need a1 = 1.\nComparing \u03bb\u0302/\u03bc with \u03b1\u0302/\u03b2 gives \u03bb2 \u2212 \u03bc1 = 1, an = 1, \u03bblii = (\u03b1i\u22121 \u2212 1)ai\u22121 for\ni = 3, . . . , n. Since we have again the part \u03bb1 \u2212 1 in \u03b1/\u03b2 we need \u03bb2 = \u03bb1 \u2212 1 and\nso \u03bc1 = \u03bb1 \u2212 2.\nSuppose we have li = ai = 1 and \u03b1i = \u03bbi for 1 \u2264 i < p and fixed p \u2265 2. This\nholds true for p = 2. Since li+1 = ai for i \u2265 2 and l2 = 1 we have also lp = 1.\nSuppose we have \u03bbp > \u03bbp+1 + 1 where \u03bbp+1 = 0 is allowed.\nWe now construct an LR filling of \u03bb with content \u03bc. We place in \u03bb entries 1\ninto every column of \u03bb but not into the columns \u03bbp+1 + 1 and \u03bbp+1 + 2 and so we\nget an LR filling which leaves the box (p, \u03bbp+1 + 2) empty (see Figure 11). This\nmeans that there is a character [\u03bd] \u2208 [\u03bb/\u03bc] with \u03bd containing a box in position\n(p, \u03bbp+1 + 2). Since \u03b1p = \u03bbp+1 + 1 the box (p, \u03bbp+1 + 2) is not in \u03b1 and so there\nis no character [\u03bd] \u2208 [\u03b1/\u03b2] with \u03bd containing a box in position (p, \u03bbp+1 + 2). This\ngives [\u03bb/\u03bc] 6= [\u03b1/\u03b2]. So we need \u03bbp = \u03bbp+1 + 1 = \u03b1p .\nSo now suppose we have ap > 1.\nPlacing in \u03b1 the entries into the rows 1 to p \u2212 1 and p + 2 to l gives an LR filling\nwhich leaves the box (p + 1, \u03b1p ) empty (see Figure 11) and so we have a character\n[\u03bd] \u2208 [\u03b1/\u03b2] with \u03bd containing a box in position (p + 1, \u03b1p ). Since lp = 1 the\np + 1th row in \u03bb has only \u03bbp+1 < \u03bbp = \u03b1p boxes which and so there is no character\n\n\fEQUALITY OF MULTIPLICITY FREE SKEW CHARACTERS\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1\n\u03bb:\n\n1 1\n\n15\n\n3\n\u03b1:\n4\n\n1\n\n(p, \u03bbp+1 + 2)\n\n5\n6\n\n(p + 1, \u03b1p )\n\nFigure 11. Lemma 3.9: LR fillings of \u03bb and \u03b1\n[\u03bd] \u2208 [\u03bb/\u03bc] with \u03bd containing a box in position (p + 1, \u03b1p ) and so [\u03bb/\u03bc] 6= [\u03b1/\u03b2] for\nap > 1 and so we need ap = 1.\nIt now follows by induction that \u03b1 = \u03bb has to be a staircase partition \u03bb =\n(l, l \u2212 1, . . . , 2, 1) which then also gives b = \u03bc1 and so \u03bb/\u03bc = (\u03b1/\u03b2)\u2032 .\n\u0003\nThe following lemma covers by conjugation also the case when \u03bc1 = 1, b = a\u22121 =\nl \u2212 1.\nLemma 3.10. Let \u03bb/\u03bc and \u03b1/\u03b2 be skew diagrams with m = 1, \u03b21 = \u03b11 \u22121 = \u03bb1 \u22121,\nb > 1.\nThen [\u03bb/\u03bc] 6= [\u03b1/\u03b2].\nProof. We have a1 > b since otherwise \u03b1/\u03b2 would decay.\nRemoving a1 \u2212 b boxes from the top of \u03b1/\u03b2 gives \u03b1\u0302/\u03b2 which decays into\n\u03b1\u0302/\u03b2 = (1b ) \u2297 (\u03b1a2 2 , \u03b1a3 3 , \u03b1a4 4 , . . .).\nSince \u03bc = (\u03bc1 ) we have that if \u03bb/\u03bc decays after a1 \u2212 b boxes are removed from\nthe top and in total (a1 \u2212 b) * \u03bb1 boxes it decays into\n\u03bb\u0302/\u03bc = (\u03bb1 \u2212 \u03bc1 ) \u2297 (\u03bbl22 , \u03bbl33 , \u03bbl44 , . . .).\nSince b > 1 we get [\u03bb/\u03bc] 6= [\u03b1/\u03b2].\n\n\u0003\n\nThe following lemma covers by conjugation also the case when \u03bc1 = 1, \u03b21 =\n\u03b11 \u2212 1 = \u03bb1 \u2212 1.\nLemma 3.11. Let \u03bb/\u03bc and \u03b1/\u03b2 be skew diagrams with \u03bc1 > 1 = m, b = l \u2212 1 =\na \u2212 1.\nThen [\u03bb/\u03bc] 6= [\u03b1/\u03b2].\nProof. If we remove the top boxes from \u03b1/\u03b2 we get a partition \u03b1\u0302/\u03b2.\nIf the skew diagram \u03bb\u0302/\u03bc obtained after removing the top box of every column\nin \u03bb/\u03bc is a partition we have l1 = 1 and \u03bb2 \u2264 \u03bc1 . This means that \u03bb/\u03bc decays. \u0003\nThe following lemma covers by conjugation also the case when m = b = l \u2212 1.\nLemma 3.12. Let \u03bb/\u03bc and \u03b1/\u03b2 be skew diagrams with \u03bc1 = \u03b21 = \u03bb1 \u2212 1 and\n[\u03bb/\u03bc] = [\u03b1/\u03b2].\nThen \u03bb/\u03bc = \u03b1/\u03b2.\nProof. Since \u03bb/\u03bc and \u03b1/\u03b2 are connected we need l1 > m, a1 > b and because of the\npart \u03bb1 which therefore exists in \u03bb/\u03bc and \u03b1/\u03b2 we have l1 \u2212 m = a1 \u2212 b. Removing\nthe top l1 \u2212 m boxes of \u03bb/\u03bc gives:\n\u03bb\u0302/\u03bc = (1m ) \u2297 (\u03bbl22 , \u03bbl33 , \u03bbl44 . . .)\n\n\f16\n\nC. GUTSCHWAGER\n\nand removing the top l1 \u2212 m = a1 \u2212 b boxes of \u03b1/\u03b2 gives:\n\u03b1\u0302/\u03b2 = (1b ) \u2297 (\u03b1a2 2 , \u03b1a3 3 , \u03b1a4 4 . . .).\nThis gives \u03bb/\u03bc = \u03b1/\u03b2.\n\n\u0003\n\nLemma 3.13. Let \u03bb/\u03bc and \u03b1/\u03b2 be skew diagrams with m > 1, \u03bc1 = \u03bb1 \u22121, b = l\u22121.\nThen [\u03bb/\u03bc] 6= [\u03b1/\u03b2].\nProof. Removing the top box of every column of \u03b1/\u03b2 gives a partition \u03b1\u0302/\u03b2.\nSince \u03bc = ((\u03bb1 \u2212 1)m ) with l1 > m > 1 removing the top boxes of every column\nof \u03bb/\u03bc can only give a partition if \u03bb2 = 0.\n\u0003\nSince the previous 6 lemmas cover all cases when [\u03bb/\u03bc] and [\u03b1/\u03b2] are multiplicity\nfree skew characters with both \u03bb and \u03b1 having 4 or more different parts we get\ntogether with the previous theorems the following theorem which holds true without\nadditional prerequisites from this section:\nTheorem 3.14. Let \u03bb/\u03bc and \u03b1/\u03b2 be (connected or decaying) basic skew diagrams\nand [\u03bb/\u03bc] = [\u03b1/\u03b2] multiplicity free.\nThen up to translation or rotation\n\u2022 \u03bb/\u03bc = \u03b1/\u03b2\n\u2022 or \u03bb = \u03b1 = (l, l \u2212 1, . . . , 2, 1) and the skew diagrams are conjugate of each\nother \u03bb/\u03bc = (\u03b1/\u03b2)\u2032 .\nHere again translation or rotation does not require the entire skew diagram to be\ntranslated or rotated, but also allows translation or rotation of the skew diagrams\ninto which \u03bb/\u03bc decays if it decays.\nAcknowledgement: John Stembridge's \"SF-package for maple\" [Ste] was very\nhelpful for computing examples.
