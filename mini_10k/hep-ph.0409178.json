The polarization of the electron beam\nalone is already very useful in this respect. If the positron beam is also polarized, one can\nbenefit from i) an increase of the effective polarization: for instance, a 80% e\u2212 polarization\nand a 60% e+ polarization combine into an effective polarization of 94%; ii) a better precision\nin the effective and individual polarizations; iii) a further reduction of background events:\nfor instance, the number of W \u2212 W + pairs is reduced by a factor 2 as compared to the case\nwhen only the e\u2212 beam is polarized; iiii) an increased sensitivity to non-standard couplings.\nIn addition to these improvements, the transverse polarization of both e\u2212 and e+ would allow\none to investigate CP violating couplings.\nThe polarized electron sources have been pioneered at SLAC, since the mid-1970s [2],\nand used systematically for physics experiment since 1992. The SLC electron beam was\npolarized to around 80%. Such sources are based on a strained semiconductor photocathode,\nwhich absorbs circularly polarized laser photons of energy close to the band gap. State-ofthe-art of polarized electron sources shows that they are presently meeting the linear collider\nrequirements.\nAll the schemes for obtaining longitudinally polarized positrons (except that using \u03b2 +\ndecay of some isotopes) are based on the reaction \u03b3 + \u03b3 \u2192 e+ + e\u2212 , where at least one of\ntwo photons should be circularly polarized. When the \u03b3-conversion occurs in an amorphous\ntarget, the role of the second photon in the reaction is played by an unpolarized Coulomb\nphoton providing the momentum exchange between the created particles and an atom. So,\nthe incident photon should be circularly polarized and have the energy, \u03c9, above the threshold\nvalue of 2m (m is the electron mass, a system of units ~ = c = 1 is used ). The helicity\ntransfer at high energy was established in [3] for two basic QED-processes: bremsstrahlung\nfrom electrons and e+ e\u2212 pair production by photons. For both processes, the helicity transfer\nis the most effective in the hard part of the spectra. The pair production cross section \u03c3(\u03c9)\nincreases with \u03c9, e.g., \u03c3(100MeV )/\u03c3(10MeV ) \u2243 2.44 for tungsten. From this point of view,\nthe higher is \u03c9 the larger is the positron yield. However, due to a large phase space of\nproduced positrons, they can be successfully accepted by existing matching systems only if\ntheir energy does not exceed several tens of MeV. Another argument, which may be used\nfor a proper choice of \u03c9, is to keep off the main nuclear resonances, thereby diminishing a\nharmful hadronic background.\nIf polarized electrons are available, an amorphous target can be used according to results of\n[3] for subsequent emission of circularly polarized photons and their conversion into polarized\ne+ e\u2212 pairs. Such a possibility was estimated in [4] for electrons of energy \u03b5 = 50MeV\ntraversing a thin (\u223c 0.2X0 ) amorphous target. Selecting positrons with \u03b5 > 25MeV , a yield\nof 2 * 10\u22123 per one initial electron was found. The mean polarization was about 0.6 of that\nof the initial electron beam.\nWhen e+ e\u2212 pairs are produced in collision of two real photons, the threshold condition\n(for head-on collision) reads \u03c9h * \u03c9s > m2 . Evidently, within this scheme one of the photons\nis a circularly polarized laser photon, which, typically, is rather soft (e.g., \u03c9s = 0.117eV for\nCO2 laser and \u03c9s = 2.23eV for Nd:glass laser). Unpolarized hard photons may be obtained\nfrom high-energy electrons radiating in amorphous or crystal targets. The latter option was\nconsidered in [5]. However, from the threshold condition, these photons should be really\nhard: \u03c9h > 2.23T eV for CO2 laser and \u03c9h > 112GeV for Nd:glass laser. In turn, the electron\n1\n\n\fenergy should be appreciably larger than \u03c9h .\nThe circularly polarized photons can be emitted by unpolarized electrons under helical\nmotion, which can be realized, in particular, in a helical undulator or in a circularly polarized\nlaser wave. The use of a helical undulator for the production of polarized positrons was\nproposed first in [6]. Such technique requires incident electrons of very high (of hundreds\nGeV) energy to produce a \u03b3 beam of tens MeV, since the undulator period is relatively large\n(\u223c 1 cm). This scheme is proposed in [7] for TESLA LC. It is also considered for the NLC\nproject and a dedicated experiment [8] is to be done at SLAC as a \"proof of principle\".\nOne of the challenges of this method, which requires a very long (\u223c 200 m) undulator, is an\naccurate alignment.\nA design of a polarized positron source for LC using a circularly polarized laser wave is\nproposed in [9]. Here the challenges are concerning mainly the laser. Some optimization for\nthe total laser power is worked out and particular efforts are put on the optics. Presently\nthe needed number of CO2 lasers is 10 and the incident beam energy of 5.8 GeV is chosen,\nproviding the maximum \u03b3 energy of 60 MeV. One of the advantages of this method is to have\nelectron and positron main systems independent, as the electron drive beam is of some GeV\ncompared to the 250 GeV beam considered for TESLA.\nPolarization of the emitted photons can be measured using Compton scattering of the\npolarized photons in a magnetized iron [10]. The same technique may be applied to measure\nthe polarization of created positrons after obtaining from them polarized bremsstrahlung\nphotons in an amorphous radiator.\nIn the present paper we consider the spectrum and polarization of photons emitted from\nhigh-energy electrons under helical motion. The description of the phenomenon is independent of the way how such motion is realized. This is due to the fact that the physics of the\nprocess is completely determined by the type of trajectory. Particular attention is paid to the\npractically important cases of a helical undulator and of a laser wave, which are investigated\nin detail. We derive a new, rather simple but exact, presentation of known formulas and use\nit to estimate the influence of the wave intensity, of the electron-beam angular divergence, of\nthe collimation of radiation, and of the lateral and temporal profiles of a laser bunch on the\nradiation properties.\n\n2\n\nCharacteristics of radiation at helical motion of charged\nparticles\n\nLet us, first, remind one some results of the so-called quasi-classical operator method (QCOM,\nsee e.g., [11]), which are important here. Within this method, which accurately takes into\naccount recoil effects, the radiation characteristics are expressed via the classical trajectory\n(velocity) of a charged particle in a given external field. At appreciably large energies this\nis true for a wide class of external fields (see the applicability conditions of QCOM in [12]).\nThus, if different field configurations provide similar electron trajectories, radiation will be\nsimilar as well, being described by the same formulas. As was emphasized in [13], one pair\nof such equivalent systems is presented just by a helical undulator and a circularly polarized\nlaser wave. Really, in both cases the transverse momentum, p\u22a5 (t) is\np\u22a5 (t) = < p\u22a5 > +p\u22a5 [e1 cos(\u03c90 t) + \u03bbe2 sin(\u03c90 t)] ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere < p\u22a5 > is a mean value of p\u22a5 (t), so that < . . . > means the averaging over a period\nof motion, and \u03bb = \u00b11 corresponds to the sense of rotation of p\u22a5 (t). We use the Cartesian\n2\n\n\fbasis (e1 , e2 , e3 ), where e3 is directed along the electron beam momentum, i.e., parallel to\nthe undulator axis. We suppose that a laser wave propagates towards the beam. Then the\n\"trajectory helicity\", \u03bb, in Eq.(1) coincides with that of the magnetic field in an undulator\nand is opposite to the helicity of the laser wave.\nAnother argument in favor of the similarity under discussion was also given in [13]. This\nis a similarity of the undulator electromagnetic field (UF) to the field of a laser wave (LW) in\nthe reference system moving along e3 with V =< v3 >, where an electron is on the average\nat rest (RS). Really, in the laboratory system (LS), UF providing the trajectory (1) is purely\nmagnetic and reads\nHLS = B[e1 cos \u03b6 + \u03bbe2 sin \u03b6];\n\n\u03b6 = kz = (\u03bax);\n\nz = x3 ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere 4-vector \u03ba = (0, 0, 0, \u2212k), k = 2\u03c0/\u03bbu , and \u03bbu is the undulator period. In the electron\nrest system, we obtain for UF\n\u03ba0\u2032 B\n[e1 cos \u03b6 + \u03bbe2 sin \u03b6] ,\nkV\nB\n= \u03ba0\u2032 [\u2212\u03bbe1 sin \u03b6 + e2 cos \u03b6] ,\nk\n\nu\nHRS\n=\nu\nERS\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03b3 = (1 \u2212 V 2 )\u22121/2 and \u03ba \u2032 = \u03b3k(V, 0, 0, \u22121), that is \u03ba0\u2032 = \u03b3kV \u2248 \u03b3k. At \u03b3 \u226b 1 the\nelectromagnetic field (3) corresponds to the wave of quasi-photons (0 6= \u03ba \u20322 = k 2 \u226a m2 )\npropagating towards the electron beam and having the helicity \u2212\u03bb. In turn, LW with the\nhelicity \u2212\u03bb is described in LS by the vector potential\nA = a[e1 cos \u03c7 + \u03bbe2 sin \u03c7],\n\n\u03c7 = (\u03bax),\n\n\u03ba = \u03ba0 (1, 0, 0, \u22121) .\n\n(4)\n\nThen in RS the LW-field reads\nw\nHRS\n= \u2212\u03bba\u03ba0\u2032 [e1 cos \u03c7 + \u03bbe2 sin \u03c7] ,\n\n(5)\nw\nERS\n\n=\n\n\u2212\u03bba\u03ba0\u2032 [\u2212\u03bbe1\n\nsin \u03c7 + e2 cos \u03c7] .\n\nHere \u03ba0\u2032 = \u03b3\u03ba0 (1 + V ) \u2248 2\u03b3\u03ba0 is the laser photon frequency (energy) in RS. The similarity\nof two fields in RS is clearly seen from Eqs.(3) and (5).\nRadiation in LW depends on two parameters. The intensity parameter, \u03be 2 , is expressed\nvia a vector potential: \u03bew2 = e2 < A2 > /m2 (e is the electron charge). An expression for\nthis parameter in the case of an undulator may be obtained from comparison of equations\n(5) and (3) resulting in \u03beu2 = (eB/km)2 . (In the literature dedicated to undulators, the\nnotation K 2 is usually used for this parameter.) Going back to Eq.(1), we conclude that\nthe amplitude p\u22a5 = \u03bem, while \u03c90 = k for an undulator and \u03c90 = 2\u03ba0 for LW. In fact, the\nargument of oscillating functions in Eq.(1) is (\u03bax(t)). In LS, the phase (\u03bax(t)) goes over into\n\u03c90 t at assumed conditions: when the electron energy is appreciably large, \u03b5/m \u226b 1, and the\ntransverse velocity of the electron is small v\u22a5 \u226a 1. The parameter \u03be 2 can be expressed also\nin terms of the particle trajectory\n\u03be2 =\n\n< p2\u22a5 (t) > \u2212 < p\u22a5 (t) >2\n,\nm2\n\ncharacterizing thereby the deviation of the trajectory from a straight line. On the other hand,\n\u03be 2 gives a scale of the interaction strength (see, e.g., p.259 in [11]) in the photon emission.\n3\n\n\fIn fact, we have roughly \u03be 2 \u2248 \u03b1Nint , where \u03b1 \u2243 1/137 is the fine structure constant and Nint\ndenotes the number of LW photons (or of quasi-photons in the undulator case) within the\ninteraction volume, Vint . The latter is approximately Vint \u223c \u03bb2C \u03bbw since the transverse size\nof the interaction region is about the Compton wave length, \u03bbC = 1/m \u2243 3.86 * 10\u221211 cm,\nand the longitudinal size is about the LW length, \u03bbw . As known, the photon emission rate is\nroughly proportional to \u03be 2 for \u03be 2 . 1. From this point of view, larger values of \u03be 2 are more\nattractive. For a helical undulator, where\n\u03beu2 = [0.935 * B(T ) * \u03bbu (cm)]2 ,\nvalues of \u03be 2 \u223c 0.5 \u00f7 1 seem achievable. In the laser case, extremely high power density P is\nneeded to reach even \u03be 2 \u223c 0.1 as\n\u03bew2 = 3.66 * 10\u221219 \u03bb2w (\u03bcm) * P (W/cm2 ) .\nFor example, in [9] a peak P of 2.9 * 1015 W/cm2 is assumed at the focal point, which cor2\nresponds to the maximal value \u03bemax\n\u2243 0.12. Note that \u03bew2 diminishes at the periphery of a\nlaser bunch proportional to the density nw of laser photons (\u03bew2 = 2\u03b1\u03bbw \u03bb2C nw ).\nRadiation in LW depends also on the purely kinematic parameter s = 2(\u03bap)/m2 , which\nappears in the description of the conventional Compton scattering. Recollect that the edge\nof the Compton spectrum is at u \u2261 \u03c9/(\u03b5 \u2212 \u03c9) = s (or at x \u2261 \u03c9/\u03b5 = s/(1 + s)). We have\nsu \u2243 0.95 * 10\u22126 * \u03b5(GeV )/\u03bbu (cm) for a undulator and sw \u2243 1.53 * 10\u22122 * \u03b5(GeV )\u03ba0 (eV ) for\nLW. We emphasize that su \u226a 1 at any reasonable electron energy \u03b5. A magnitude of sw \u223c 1\ncan be easily achieved. However, at sw \u223c 1 emitted photons will be too hard, since, as\nexplained above, photons in the energy range of several tens of MeV are needed for effective\nproduction of positrons. To meet this condition, noticeably different electron energies should\nbe used in undulators and LW, though s \u226a 1 in both cases. Since at small s soft photons\nwith \u03c9/\u03b5 \u223c s \u226a 1 are mainly radiated, the recoil effect may be neglected and the classical\ndescription of the process becomes valid.\n\n2.1\n\nSpectral-angular distribution of radiation\n\nWe can present the differential rate (probability per unite length or time) of photon emission\nfrom a unpolarized electron in the following general form\ndN\u03b3\n1\nA\n= (A + B\u03b6) \u2261 (1 + \u03b7\u03b6) ,\nd\u0393dl\n2\n2\n\n\u03b7=\n\nB\n,\nA\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u03b7 is the Stokes vector of emitted radiation and the auxiliary vector \u03b6 (|\u03b6| = 1) describes\nthe analyzing ability of some ideal photon detector. When we consider the spectral-angular\ndistribution, d\u0393 = d\u03c9dn\u22a5, where n\u22a5 = k\u22a5 /\u03c9. The quantities A and B are obtained from\nthe appropriate expression for the probability derived within QCOM (e.g., from Eqs. (3)\nand (4) in [14]) if a dependence on time of the transverse momentum (velocity) is specified.\nWhen such a dependence is given by Eq.(1), we obtain, doing as in [13]\n\u221e\n\u0011\n\u0010\nn\n\u03b1 X\u0010 (n) (n) \u0011\n\u03b4(1 + \u03be 2 + y 2 \u2212 ) ;\na ,b\nA, B =\n\u03c0 n=1\n\u03bd\n\na(n) =\n\ni\n\u03be 2 \u03c6(u) h 2\n2\nJn\u22121 (Z) + Jn+1\n(Z) \u2212 2Jn2 (Z) \u2212 Jn2 (Z) ;\n4\n4\n\n\f(7)\n2\n\n2\n\n\u03bb\u03be \u03c6(u) 1 + \u03be \u2212 y\n2\n2\nJn\u22121\n(Z) \u2212 Jn+1\n(Z) ;\n*\n2\n2\n4\n1+\u03be +y\n\n(n)\n\n=\n\n(n)\n\n= \u2212blin sin 2\u03c6\u0303 ,\n\nb2\n\nb1\n\n2h\n\n(n)\n\ni\n\n(n)\n\n(n)\n\nb3 = \u2212blin cos 2\u03c6\u0303 ,\n\nh\ni\n(n)\nblin = Jn2 (Z) + \u03be 2 Jn2 (Z) \u2212 Jn\u22121 (Z)Jn+1 (Z) .\nHere\n\u03bd = u/s ,\n\ns=\n\n2(\u03bap)\n,\nm2\n\nu=\n\n\u03c9\n,\n\u03b5\u2212\u03c9\n\n\u03c6(u) = 1 + u +\n\n1\n,\n1+u\n(8)\n\nZ = 2\u03bd\u03bey ,\n\n2\n\n2\n\ny = (\u03b3nef ) ,\n\n\u03b3 = \u03b5/m ,\n\nnef = n\u22a5 \u2212 < v\u22a5 > ,\n\nJn (Z) are the Bessel functions and the angle \u03c6\u0303 is the azimuth of the vector nef . Expression\n(7) follows from Eqs. (3.5)-(3.9) in [13] and coincides with Eq.(5.23) in [11] if the latter is\ndivided by \u03c9 to pass on from the intensity in [11] to the probability considered here. The\nonly generalization here is in retaining < v\u22a5 >=< p\u22a5 > /\u03b5, which was set to zero in [13]\nand [11]. The appearance of the \u03b4-function in (7) is due to the assumption that the number\nof periods in a structure, Nper = L/\u03bbu,w (L is a length of the undulator or LW bunch) is\ninfinitely large. For large but finite Nper , we obtain (see e.g., Eq.(1.148) in [11]) a set of\nnarrow (width of 1/Nper ) peaks at the same points \u03bd(1 + \u03be 2 + y 2) = n as in Eq.(7).\nWhen radiation is emitted along the mean electron velocity, we have n\u22a5 =< v\u22a5 > and\ny = Z = 0. Then the sum over n in Eq.(7) reduces to the only term with n = 1. Moreover,\n2\nonly Jn\u22121\n(Z) does not vanish and goes to unity. As a result, the linear polarization vanishes\nfor the forward direction, while the circular polarization is maximal as \u03b72 \u2212\u2192 \u03bb. Then the\ndependence of the probability on the parameter \u03be 2 becomes linear except for the term \u03be 2 in the\nargument of the \u03b4-function. In this connection, let us point out that the harmonic's number,\nn, is actually the difference between numbers of LW photons absorbed from and re-emitted\ninto the wave. From angular momentum conservation and some additional consideration it\ncan be shown that only n = 1 is allowed in the forward direction for the circularly polarized\nLW. To the same time, \u03be 2 in the \u03b4-function reflects a change of the mean longitudinal velocity\n2\ndue to the interaction with a wave as a classical object, namely, v32 (t) \u2243 1 \u2212 \u03b3 \u22122 \u2212 v\u22a5\n(t) and\n2\n2\n2\n< v3 >\u2243\np 1 \u2212 (1 + \u03be )/\u03b3 . That is why the characteristic angle of radiation, \u03b8ph , becomes\n\u03b8ph \u223c 1 + \u03be 2 /\u03b3. When y increases, the circular polarization diminishes. It vanishes at\ny 2 = 1 + \u03be 2 and changes its sign at further increase of the emission angle (of the quantity y).\nThe first harmonic (n = 1) dominates also for \u03be 2 \u226a 1, where we obtain from Eq.(7) using\nthe notation defined in Eqs.(7) and (8)\n\u0011\n\u0010\n1\n\u03b1\u03be 2 \u0010 (C) (C) \u0011\n\u03b4(1 + y 2 \u2212 ) ;\na ,b\nA(C) , B (C) =\n\u03c0\n\u03bd\na(C) =\n\n\u03c6(u)\n\u2212 \u03bd(1 \u2212 \u03bd) ,\n4\n\n(C)\n\nb2\n\n(C)\n\nblin = \u03bd(1 \u2212 \u03bd) ,\n(9)\n2\n\n=\n\n\u03bb\u03c6(u) 1 \u2212 y\n\u03bb\u03c6(u)\n*\n=\n(2\u03bd \u2212 1) .\n4\n1 + y2\n4\n\nAs should be, Eq.(9) reproduces well known formulas obtained within the Born approximation\nof the perturbation theory in \u03be 2 for the Compton effect. The latter is usually described in\n5\n\n\fterms of a cross section which is obtained from Eq.(9)after dividing by the flux. More\nprecisely, we have at \u03be 2 \u226a 1\n(C)\n\n4\u03c0\u03b1\u03b5\ndN\u03b3\nd\u03c3 (C)\n= 2 2\n*\n.\nd\u0393\nm \u03be (\u03bap) d\u0393dl\n\n(10)\n\nUsing the following relation (see 8.442 in [15])\nJn2 (z)\n\n=\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n(\u22121)k\u2212n\n\nk=n\n\n\u0010 z \u00112k C k\u2212n\n2k\n;\n2\n(k!)2\n\nCNM =\n\nN!\n,\nM!(N \u2212 M)!\n\nwe can expand the quantities A, B defined by Eq.(7) in powers of the parameter \u03be 2\n\u0010\n\nA, B\n\n\u0011\n\n=\n\n\u221e\n\u221e\n\u03b1 2X\nC k\u2212n (\u03bd\u03bey)2(k\u22121) \u0010 (k) (k) \u0011\nn X\n(\u22121)k\u2212n 2k\n\u03be\na ,b\n;\n\u03b4(1 + \u03be 2 + y 2 \u2212 )\n\u03c0 n=1\n\u03bd k=n\n[(k \u2212 1)!]2\n\n(11)\na(k) =\n(k)\n\nb1\n\n\u03c6(u)\n\u2212\n4\n\n\u0010 \u03bdy \u00112\nk\n\n(k)\n\nb2 =\n(k)\n\n= \u2212blin sin 2\u03c6\u0303 ,\n\n\u03bb\u03bd\u03c6(u)\n(1 + \u03be 2 \u2212 y 2 ) ;\n4k\n\u0010 \u03bdy \u00112 h\n\u03be2 i\n(k)\n(k)\n1+\n.\n= \u2212blin cos 2\u03c6\u0303 ,\nblin =\nk\nk+1\n(k)\n\n,\nb3\n\nSuch presentation of the probability (6) essentially simplifies calculations for \u03be 2 . 1, which is\nthe most interesting region in applications. The formulas obtained above should be averaged\nover < v\u22a5 > using a corresponding distribution in the incident electron beam.\n\n2.2\n\nSpectral characteristics of radiation\n\nIn practice, radiation is always collimated. Then, to obtain the spectrum and polarization of\nphotons accepted by a collimator, we should take an integral of the following type\nZ\n\n\u03a9c\n\ndn\u22a5\n\nZ\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\nd\u03b8e f (\u03b8e ) A, B ,\n\n(12)\n\nwhere \u03a9c is the solid angle of a collimator,R f (\u03b8e ) is the distribution over < v\u22a5 > (we have\nintroduced \u03b8e \u2261< v\u22a5 >) normalized by d\u03b8e f (\u03b8e ) = 1, and A, B are defined by Eq.(7)\nor Eq.(11). Below we consider a round collimator with the opening angle \u03b8col and axially\nsymmetric distributions f (\u03b8e ) \u2261 f (\u03b8e2 ). Remember that the quantities A, B depend on the\nangles n\u22a5 and \u03b8e only in the combination (see (8)) nef = n\u22a5 \u2212 \u03b8e . The azimuth of nef\nenters only the linear polarization via sin 2\u03c6\u0303 and cos 2\u03c6\u0303, while the value of n2ef is fixed by\n\u03b4-function ( (\u03b3nef )2 = y 2 = n/\u03bd \u2212 (1 + \u03be 2 )). After the shift \u03b8e \u2212\u2192 \u03b8\u0303e + n\u22a5 in Eq.(12) the\nintegration over \u03b8\u0303e becomes trivial under our assumptions. Really, the linear polarization\nvanishes at integration over azimuth and integration over |\u03b8\u0303e | is carried out using \u03b4-function.\nAs a result, we have\n\u0011\nA(\u03c9) \u0010\nd2 N\u03b3\n1 + \u03b7 (\u03c9) \u03b6 ,\n=\nd\u03c9dl\n2\n6\n\n\u03b7 (\u03c9) =\n\nB (\u03c9)\n;\nA(\u03c9)\n\n(\u03c9)\n\nB1\n\n(\u03c9)\n\n= B3\n\n= 0;\n(13)\n\n\f\u0010\n\n(\u03c9)\n\nA(\u03c9) , B2\n\na(\u03c9) =\n\n\u0011\n\n=\n\n\u221e\n\u221e\n\u0011\nk\u2212n\n2\n(k\u22121) \u0010\nX\n\u03b1\u03be 2 X\nk\u2212n C2k (\u03bd\u03be Xn )\n(\u03c9) (\u03c9)\n;\n\u0398(X\n)\nF\n(X\n,\n\u03b8\n)\n(\u22121)\na\n,\nb\nn\nn\ncol\n2\n2\n\u03b3 2 n=1\n[(k\n\u2212\n1)!]\nk=n\n\n\u03c6(u) \u03bdXn\n\u2212 2 ,\n4\nk\n\n(\u03c9)\n\nb2 =\n\n\u03bb\u03c6(u)\n[2\u03bd(1 + \u03be 2 ) \u2212 n] ,\n4k\n\nXn = n \u2212 \u03bd(1 + \u03be 2 ) .\n\nwhere \u0398(Xn ) is the step function: \u0398(x) = 1 for x > 0 and \u0398(x) = 0 for x < 0 , the variable\n\u03bd \u221d \u03c9 is defined in (8). The function F (Xn , \u03b8col ), which appears in integration over dn\u22a5 in\nEq.(12), has the form\nr\nZ\n\u0011\n\u0010\n1\nn2\u22a5 \u0011 \u0010\nXn\n,\n(14)\n\u03bc=\nF (Xn , \u03b8col ) = dn\u22a5 \u0398 1 \u2212 2 f n\u22a5 + e\u03bc\u03b8col ,\n\u03b8col\n\u03b3\u03b8col\n\u03bd\nwhere e is an arbitrary unit vector in the transverse plane. When the angular spread \u2206e in\nthe electron beam is appreciably small, \u2206e \u226a \u03b8col , we can substitute (\u03bc\u03b8col )2 for n2\u22a5 in the\nargument of \u0398-function in (14). Then, using the normalization condition for the function f ,\nwe find out that F (Xn , \u03b8col ) \u2212\u2192 \u0398(1 \u2212 \u03bc2 ) at \u2206e \u226a \u03b8col .

Generally speaking,\nR\u03b5\nin this case it is more convenient to calculate the spectrum and the rate, dN\u03b3 /dl = d\u03c9A(\u03c9) ,\n0\n\nusing simple integral representation for these quantities (see e.g., Eq.(5.34) in [11]). In\nparticular, we have for small s \u226a 1\n\u0011 \u03b1(\u03bap) \u03be 2\ndN\u03b3 \u0010\ns\u226a1 \u2243\ndl\n\u03c0\u03b5\n\nZ\u221e\n0\n\nd\u03c4\nsin2 \u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4 2 cos 2\u03c4\n.\n*\n\u03c4 2 \u03c4 2 + \u03be 2 (\u03c4 2 \u2212 sin2 \u03c4 )\n\n(16)\n\nWe emphasize that, for s \u226a 1, the rate turns out to be independent of the electron energy\n\u03b5 as (\u03bap)/\u03b5 = \u03c90 (remember that \u03c90 = 2\u03ba0 for LW). The first term in the expansion of the\nrate (16) in \u03be 2 at \u03be 2 \u226a 1 is simply W0 \u2261 2\u03b1\u03be 2(\u03bap)/3\u03b5 and, using Eq.(10), the Thomson limit\nof the Compton-scattering cross section \u03c3 (C) (s \u226a 1) \u2243 8\u03c0\u03b12 /3m2 \u2243 665mb is reproduced.\nThe rate (16) is shown in Fig.1 in units of W0\nThe intensity of radiation, I\u03b3 , reads especially simple for s \u226a 1 when the classical formula\nis valid\n\u03b1\u03be 2m2 s2\n2\nIcl = I\u03b3 (s \u226a 1) =\n\u2261 \u03b3 4 < w 2 (t) > ,\n6\n3\nwhere w(t) is the particle acceleration. The radiative energy loss of an electron is determined\nby I\u03b3 .\nIn further analysis of the role of photon collimation and angular divergence in the electron\nbeam we will use the Gaussian shape for the function f\n\u0010 \u03b82 \u0011\n1\nfG =\nexp \u2212 e 2 .\n2\n2\u03c0\u2206e\n2\u2206e\n\n7\n\n\f1.00\n\n0.90\n\n0.85\n\nW\n\n0\n\n-1\n\ndN /dl (s<<1)\n\u03b3\n\n0.95\n\n0.80\n\n0.75\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n\u03be\n\n2\n\nFigure 1: Photon emission rate (16) in units of W0 .\nThen we obtain from Eq.(14)\nFG (\u03b2, \u03bc) = 2\u03b2\n\nZ1\n\ndxx exp[\u2212\u03b2(x2 + \u03bc2 )] I0 (2\u03b2\u03bcx) =\n\n0\n\n1\n= \u0398(1 \u2212 \u03bc ) \u2212\n\u03c0\n2\n\nZ\u03c0\n\nd\u03c6\n(1 + \u03bc cos \u03c6) exp[\u2212\u03b2g(\u03c6)] ;\ng(\u03c6)\n\n(17)\n\n0\n\ng(\u03c6) = 1 + 2\u03bc cos \u03c6 + \u03bc2 ,\n\n\u03bc2 =\n\nXn\n,\n\u03bd(\u03b3\u03b8col )2\n\n\u03b2=\n\n\u03b82col\n,\n2\u22062e\n\nwhere I0 is the modified Bessel function. The first form of FG (\u03b2, \u03bc) in Eq.(17) follows directly\nfrom Eq.(14), the second form makes more obvious the general properties of F (Xn , \u03b8col )\ndiscussed above. Shown in Fig. 2 is FG (\u03b2, \u03bc) as a function of \u03bc at different \u03b2. As seen in\nFig.2, the function FG (\u03b2, \u03bc) is very like to that for a non-divergent beam already at \u03b2 = 25.\nAt \u03b2 = 4 the shape of the corresponding curve is substantially different from \u0398(1 \u2212 \u03bc2 ),\nbut its value at \u03bc = 0 (peak position) is still very close to 1. Finally, at \u03b2 = 1 we have\nFG (\u03b2 = 1, \u03bc = 0) \u2243 0.63 and a slow decrease of FG when \u03bc increases. In other words,\ncollimation of radiation within angles comparable with the angular divergence of an electron\nbeam is meaningless.\nThe spectrum summed up over photon polarizations given by A(\u03c9) in Eq.(13), is plotted\n(\u03c9)\n(\u03c9)\nin Figs.3 and 4 as a function of \u03bd\u0303 = \u03bd(1 + \u03be 2 ). The component \u03b72 = B2 /A(\u03c9) of the\nStokes vector, which describes the circular polarization of photons is presented as well. The\nkinematic parameter s (see Eq.(8)) was set to s = 0.01, when the normalization factor Wnoc\nis given by Eq.(16).Calculations are performed at \u03bb = \u22121 (see Eq.(1) for the definition of \u03bb),\nwhich corresponds to the positive helicity of LW and to the negative \"helicity\" of the electron\ntrajectory in an undulator or LW. Radiation spectra are presented for \u03be 2 = 0.1 (a) and for\n\u03be 2 = 1 (b). In Fig.3, radiation characteristics in the absence of collimation (solid curves) are\ncompared with those at collimation within \u03b8col satisfying the condition (\u03b3\u03b8col )2 = 1 + \u03be 2 for a\nnon-divergent electron beam (dashed curves).

A role of the beam\ndivergence is illustrated by Fig.4, where spectra and polarizations are plotted for the same\n\u03b8col as in Fig.3, but at finite values of the parameter \u03b2 (see Eq.(17)). In accordance with\nFig.2, structures at \u03bd\u0303 = n/2 are smeared out and additional suppression of the first peak at\n\u03b2 = 1 is seen even for \u03be 2 = 0.1.\n\n2.3\n\nTotal yield\n\nA total radiation yield during one pass of an electron through the whole undulator or a single\nlaser bunch is obtained by integration of the instantaneous characteristics over time (length\nl). The electron energy \u03b5 diminishes due to the radiative energy loss given by the radiation\nintensity I\u03b3 . In Eq.(13), \u03b5 is represented explicitly (\u03b3 \u22122 as a common multiplier and in the\nquantity \u03bc entering F (Xn , \u03b8col )) and implicitly via \u03bd and u. However, the total energy loss and\nthe energy spread in the electron beam is typically small as compared with \u03b5 and therefore\nwill be neglected below. In the opposite case of the appreciably large energy loss, total\nradiation should be described in terms of the electron-photon shower, which development is\ndetermined by the probabilities obtained above. Strictly speaking, the collimation angle \u03b8col\nalso depends on l. Practically this is important only in the case of an undulator when the\ntotal length, L, is comparable with the distance to a target. In the case of LW we can neglect\na variation of \u03b8col over L as a laser bunch is usually very short. The parameter \u03be 2 is constant\nfor an undulator and depends on l for LW.\nThus, the total spectral yield from an undulator, dN\u03b3 /d\u03c9, is given within our approx(\u03c9)\nimation by Eq.(13), if we multiply the quantities A(\u03c9) , B2 by L and substitute \u03a6 =\nRL\nL\u22121 dl F (Xn , \u03b8col (l)) for F (Xn , \u03b8col ).

Note also that the first item in \u03a6G coincides with FG (\u03b2in , \u03bcin ) from Eq.(17) and\nthat Q = \u03b2in \u03bc2in = \u03b2out \u03bc2out is independent of the collimation angle. In the absence of\nthe external collimator its role is played by the aperture of an undulator. Thus, radiation\nwhich escapes the undulator may be described using \u03a6G from Eq.(19), where we should set\n\u03b8in = arctan(r/L) \u223c r/L (r is the aperture radius) and tend \u03bcout to zero.\nAs explained above, the electron energy and collimation angle may be considered as\nconstant during collision of an electron beam with a laser bunch. Thus, a variation of the parameter \u03be 2 only should be taken into account when obtaining the total yield. Moreover, since\n\u03be 2 depends also on coordinates r a convolution should be performed with a corresponding\ndistribution ne (r, t) in the electron beam. Let G(\u03be 2) is some instantaneous characteristics of\nradiation, for example, G(\u03be 2) = A(\u03c9) from Eq.(13), if we consider the spectrum. Then the\ncorresponding total yield, Gout , reads\nZ\u221e Z\n\u0010\n\u0011\nGout =\ndt dr ne (r, t) G \u03be 2 (r, t) .\n(20)\n\u2212\u221e\n\nThis expression greatly simplifies for \u03be 2 \u226a 1 when (see, e.g, Eq.(9)) the rather complicated,\nnon-linear dependance of G(\u03be 2) on \u03be 2 reduces to linear one: G(\u03be 2 \u226a 1) \u2243 \u03be 2 G0 , where G0 is\nindependent of \u03be 2 . As explained above, we really have \u03be 2 \u226a 1 for lasers. Then, recollecting the\ninterrelation between \u03be 2 and the laser photon density nw , which reads \u03be 2 = 4\u03c0\u03b1nw /(\u03ba0 m2 ),\nwe can rewrite Eq.(20)\nZ\u221e Z\n4\u03c0\u03b1G\n0\n(C)\nGout =\ndt\ndr ne (r, t) nw (r, t) .\n(21)\n\u03ba0 m2\n\u2212\u221e\n\nFor Gaussian shape of the lateral profiles in both electron and laser bunches we have\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011 exp \u2212\u03c12 /2\u03c3e2\n(e)\n(w)\n, zc(e) (t) = z0 + t , zc(w) (t) = z0 \u2212 t ,\nne (r, t) = Ne ge z \u2212 zc(e) (t)\n2\u03c0\u03c3e2\n\u0010\n\u0011\nZ\u221e\n\u0010\n\u0011 exp \u2212\u03c12 /2\u03c3w2 (z)\nnw (r, t) = Nw gw z \u2212 zc(w) (t)\n,\ndz ge,w (z) = 1 ,\n(22)\n2\u03c0\u03c3w2 (z)\n\u2212\u221e\n\nwhere Ne and Nw = Eb /\u03ba0 (Eb is the laser-bunch energy) are the total numbers of electrons and photons in corresponding bunches. Functions ge,w (z) characterize the longitudinal\n(e,w)\n(temporal) profiles of the bunches and zc (t) mark positions of the bunch centers. Focusing of light, if any, is taken into account by the z-dependent width \u03c3w (z). The focal\npoint corresponds to z = 0. Evidently, the yield is maximal when the bunch centers meet\n(w)\n(e)\njust at the focal point, i.e, when z0 + z0 = 0. Using densities (22) and making the shift\n(w)\nt \u2212\u2192 t \u2212 z + z0 , we obtain from Eq.(21) for the yield per one collision\nZ\u221e\nZ\u221e\nge (2z \u2212 t)\n2\u03b1N\nE\nG\ne\nb\n0\n(C)\ndt gw (t)\ndz 2\n.\n(23)\nGout =\n2\n(\u03ba0 m)\n\u03c3e + \u03c3w2 (z)\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n11\n\n\fRemember that for undulators we have presented the yield per one electron. Let L be the total\nlength of the laser pulse. At focusing, the width \u03c3w (z) increases rather fast with growing |z| ,\ndetermining a z-interval, which contributes to the integral in Eq.(23). When focusing is hard,\nthe size of this interval, Lef , becomes noticeably smaller than L. Concerning the electronbunch length, the shorter it is, the higher the yield. Anyway, this length should be chosen\nless or about Lef . Diminishing of \u03c3e in Eq.(23) increases the yield, the other parameters\nbeing constant. However, we should bear in mind that G0 depends on \u03b2 = \u03b82col /(2\u22062e ) (see\nEq.(17)) and that the product \u2206e * \u03c3e has a lower bound given by the beam emittance. As\nshown above, \u03b2 should be appreciably large (small \u2206e are needed) to achieve the maximal\nvalue of G0 at given collimation conditions. Thus, both \u2206e and \u03c3e should be small enough,\ni.e, a low-emittance electron beam is needed.\nTo perform further calculations in Eq.(23), we should specify a shape of the functions\ngw (t) and \u03c3w2 (z). Focusing will be taken into account by choosing\n\u03c3w2 (z) = \u03c3w2 (0)[1 + Cf y 2] , y = 4z/L .\n\n(24)\n\nLet us use for the illustration the temporal profile of a laser bunch considered in [9], where\ni\n4 h\ngw (t) =\n\u0398(\u03c4 + 2)\u0398(\u2212\u03c4 \u2212 1)(\u03c4 + 2) + \u0398(\u03c4 + 1)\u0398(1 \u2212 \u03c4 ) + \u0398(2 \u2212 \u03c4 )\u0398(\u03c4 \u2212 1)(2 \u2212 \u03c4 ) ,\n3L\nwith \u03c4 = 4t/L. Then, making the shift z \u2212\u2192 z + t/2, we can take the integral over t in\nEq.(23)\n(C)\nGout\n\n8\u03b1Ne Eb G0 R\n=\n, R = a2\n3(\u03ba0 m)2 [\u03c3e2 + \u03c3w2 (0)]\n\nZ\u221e\n\ndzge (2z) \u03a8(z) , \u03a8(z) =\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n1 h (1 + d23 )(1 + d24 ) i\n+\nln\n2\n(1 + d21 )(1 + d22 )\n\n+ d1 arctan(d1 ) + d2 arctan(d2 ) \u2212 d3 arctan(d3 ) \u2212 d4 arctan(d4 ) ;\n\n(25)\nd1 = (1 + y)/a ,\n\n\u03c3e2 + \u03c3w2 (0)\nz\nd2 = (1 \u2212 y)/a , d3 =\nd4 =\na =\n, y=4 .\n2\n2\n2\nCf \u03c3w (0)\nL\np\nThe quantity R, which was calculated using ge (z) = exp(\u2212z 2 /2\u03c3z2 )/ 2\u03c0\u03c3z2 , is shown in Fig.5\nas a function of a2 at r = L/\u03c3z = 3 (this value of r was used in [9]). At given a2 the\nquantity R increases with r. We found out that the lateral profile of a laser beam in [9],\nwhich actually is doughnut-shaped (see Fig.10 in [9]), can be satisfactorily approximated in\nthe region around the focal point by the Gaussian one with \u03c3w (0) = 19\u03bcm and Cf \u2243 11 (see\nEq.(24)). Using also \u03c3e = 20\u03bcm, we obtain a2 = 0.192 and, correspondingly, R = 0.172.\nNow any spectral characteristic of radiation may be estimated for the conditions of [9] using\nEq.(25). For example, to estimate the total number of photons emitted during a single\ncollision, G0 = 2\u03b1(\u03bap)/3\u03b5) should be substituted into Eq.(25). In [9], the electron beam\nsubsequently collides with laser bunches at 200 collision points to produce a sufficient number\nof photons. The whole length of the structure is about 60 m and there are numerous mirrors\nand collimators inside. The yield from the whole structure on the e+ e\u2212 -production target\nis a sum of the individual yields, which are described by Eq.(20)(or by its simplified version\n(25)). Note that the contribution from each collision point should be calculated at its own\ncollimation angle. The latter is determined by a distance between the collision point and the\nlast (the nearest to the target) collimator.

The calculation is performed using Eq.(25))\nand taking into account diminishing of the electron energy and the change of the collimation\nangle, while a slow increase of \u03c3e over a collision section and the laser-power loss caused\nby mirrors are neglected. Comparison of our results with Fig.14(b) in [9] shows that even\nin its simplest form our approach provides rather accurate estimations. For example, our\ncalculation overestimate the total number of all generated photons by \u223c 2.4%, and that for\nphotons hitting the target by \u223c 2.1%.\n\n3\n\nConclusion\n\nAmong various methods of obtaining longitudinally polarized positrons for future linear colliders, the most promising schemes are those using circularly polarized, high-energy photons\nfor positron production. Most effectively such photons are emitted from electrons passing\n13\n\n\fthrough a helical undulator or colliding with the circularly polarized laser wave. Though the\nphysics of the photon-emission process from electrons is the same in both cases, a drastic\ndifference in the periods of motion leads to the corresponding difference in electron energy\nneeded to produce positrons of several tens of MeV, which can be effectively captured and accelerated. While an electron energy of several GeV is appropriate in the laser case, hundreds\nof GeV are needed for undulators. Another advantage of the laser scheme is in easy switching\nof the photon (and thereby positron) helicity. This option is very useful in experiments. It\nseems, however, that there are less questions in the construction of undulators, while producing of laser systems with record parameters (very high power, high repetition rate) and\nrather sophisticated optics is still a challenge. We propose a new, rather simple presentation of known formulas describing the radiation properties in both cases. Our consideration\ntakes into account such factors as a magnitude of the wave intensity, angular divergence in\nthe electron beam, collimation of radiation, and the lateral and temporal profiles of a laser\nbunch. The developed description allows one to choose easily a set of parameters optimizing\nthe photon yield.\nAcknowledgements\nOne of us (V.S.) is thankful for kind hospitality during his stay at IPN - Lyon where a part\nof this work has been done.
