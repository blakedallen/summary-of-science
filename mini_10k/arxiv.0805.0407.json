This provides\nan explicit new class of extreme-value statistics for strongly correlated variables,\nmanifestly different from the standard Gumbel class.\n\n\fRandom Energy Model with logarithmically correlated potential\n\n2\n\n1. Introduction.\nThe Random Energy Model (REM) introduced by Derrida in [1] is characterized by the\nP\n\u2212\u03b2Vi , where \u03b2 is the inverse temperature, and V for i = 1, . . . , M\npartition function Z\u03b2 = M\ni\ni=1 e\nare random variables with the typical variance < Vi2 >= V 2 = O(log M ) for M \u2192 \u221e. Such a\nmodel, as well as its generalized version (GREM)[2, 3] continues to play a paradigmatic role in\nstatistical mechanics of disordered systems. Simple enough to allow for a detailed analytical\ninvestigation by various methods, the freezing transition exemplified by REM appears to be a\nrather generic phenomenon. It emerges with surprising regularity in a variety of physical\nsituations, ranging from transparency of random media [4], directed polymers in random\nenvironment [5], p-spin glass models and the glass transition [6], random heteropolymers and\nmodels of protein folding [7] to properties of quantum particles in a random magnetic field\n[8, 9], and thermodynamics of a single particle in random Gaussian landscapes [10]. It is also\na rich model from purely probabilistic point of view[11], and has an interesting dynamical\ncounterpart: aging [12].\nAs the low-temperature behaviour in statistical mechanics is obviously controlled by\nthe lowest available energies, it is not surprising that a detailed description of the freezing\nphenomenon is intimately related to the so-called extreme-value statistics of random variables\n[13]. For independent, identically distributed variables Vi , the cumulative probability\ndistribution Pm (x) of Vm = min{V1 , . . . , VM } is well-understood in mathematical literature\nand, provided the support of the distribution extends to \u2212\u221e but decays faster than any\npower-law, is given in the limit M \u226b 1 by the Gumbel law:\nh\n\nPm (x) = P rob(Vm > x) = exp \u2212e(x+aM )/bM\n\ni\n\n(1)\n\nHere the constants aM and bM depend explicitly on the distribution of Vi , but the double\nexponential shape of the Gumbel law is very robust (universal). This universality extends to\na very broad class of correlated variables provided those correlations decay fast enough, see a\ndetailed description in [14]. For a mathematically rigorous analysis of REM and GREM based,\nin particular, on the extreme value statistics, see [15]; see also [16] for recent developments.\nA few years ago Carpentier and Le Doussal (CLD) [9] studied a specific case of correlated\nrandom variables that is arguably the richest, most challenging, and relevant for applications.\nMore precisely, thinking of the index i as referring to the sites of a certain lattice, the covariance\nhVi Vj i considered by CLD depended on the distance d(i, j) between those sites logarithmically.\nAn independent support of the fact that logarithmically correlated potentials should play a\nspecial role was obtained recently through a thorough analysis of statistical mechanics of a\nsingle particle in high-dimensional random energy landscapes [10].\nTo understand the extreme value statistics in the logarithmic case and to relate it to\na REM-like freezing transition CLD developed a powerful, albeit non rigorous, real space\nrenormalization group approach to the distribution P(Z) of the partition function Z\u03b2 . In this\nway they discovered that logarithmic models represent, in a sense, continuous analogues of\ndirected polymers on disordered trees, a result somewhat anticipated in [8]. The statistical\nmechanics of the directed polymer problem on a tree is known to be amenable to a travelling\nwave analysis, see the celebrated paper [5]. Similarly, for the logarithmic case the Laplace\ntransform of the distribution P(Z) was also shown to satisfy a kind of travelling wave\nequation (see also works [17] for a relation between the travelling waves and the extreme\nvalue statistics, in particular, in the context of the zero-temperature directed polymer problem\non a tree). Solutions of equations of that type are known to exhibit a characteristic change\nof the shape at some critical front velocity, and following [5] that change was interpreted\n\n\fRandom Energy Model with logarithmically correlated potential\n\n3\n\nby CLD as a signal of a REM-like freezing. In particular, the CLD analysis revealed that\nsuch a transition implies, among other properties, a universal non-Gumbel shape of the farleft tail for the cumulative distribution of the minimal value of logarithmically correlated\nvariables: Pm (x \u2192 \u2212\u221e) \u2248 1 \u2212 Const |x| eax which is clearly different from the Gumbel tail\nPm (x \u2192 \u2212\u221e) \u2248 1 \u2212 Const eax .\nAlthough CLD's renormalization group is able to predict successfully the universal far-tail\nfeatures of the distribution expected to be shared by all logarithmically correlated potentials,\nthe calculation of the full distribution for a given potential is beyond the scope of that method.\nIndeed, the renormalization procedure needs specifying what the authors called a \"fusion of\nenvironments\" rule [9]. As CLD convincingly argue, the precise form of that rule is not\nimportant for recovering universal properties. But the actual shape of the travelling wave\nequation certainly depends on the particular fusion rule employed. As no guiding principle for\nthe fusion rule selection had been provided, a more detailed analysis of specific models appears\nto be problematic.\nThe present paper grew out of attempts to overcome the above difficulty. Our main\nobservation is that for a particular variant of the logarithmically-correlated REM a more\ndetailed analysis seems to be possible. In particular, we are able to conjecture the full\ndistribution function Pm (x) pertinent for the case considered. Namely, after appropriate\nrescaling the cumulative distribution Pm (x) of the minimum turns out to be given by the\ncentral result of this work:\nPm (x) = 2e\n\n\u03b2c x\n2\n\n\u0010\n\nK1 2e\n\n\u03b2c x\n2\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere K1 (x) stands for the modified Bessel (Macdonald) function, and the parameter \u03b2c\nis given by the inverse transition temperature in the model. As such, the corresponding\ndistribution is manifestly different from the standard Gumbel double-exponential form.\nOur method draws its inspiration from CLD analysis and is essentially based on the\npattern of the freezing transition revealed in [5, 9]. However, we do not resort to the\nrenormalization group construction or travelling wave technique, and in this way circumvent\nthe need to know the microscopic fusion rule. Instead, we demonstrate below that assuming\nCLD freezing scenario provides a way to extend the moments of the partition function from the\nhigh-temperature phase to the region below the transition. Roughly speaking, if those moments\ncan be explicitly calculated above the transition,\u2013 as is the case for both the standard REM as\nwell as our variant of the logarithmic model,\u2013 they can be used to conjecture the shape of the\nLaplace transform of the probability density above the transition point. Then CLD approach\ncan be used to recover the full distribution of the partition function/free energy below the\ntransition, yielding in particular the extreme value statistics.\nThe structure of the paper is the following. We start with a short general discussion of\nCLD freezing scenario, in particular its implications for the moments of the partition function\nin the low-temperature phase. As an illustration we show how CLD scenario can be used in\nthe standard REM case to recover the exact low-temperature expressions for the partition\nfunction moments, obtained long ago by Gardner and Derrida via a rather tedious analysis [3].\nAfter that we introduce and analyze the particular (circular) version of the one-dimensional\nlogarithmically correlated REM.\n\n2. CLD freezing scenario: general relations and implications\nThe central object of the subsequent analysis is the Laplace-transform G\u03b2 (p) of the probability\ndistribution P(Z\u03b2 ) of the partition function: G\u03b2 (p) = hexp{\u2212pZ\u03b2 }i. Here and henceforth the\n\n\fRandom Energy Model with logarithmically correlated potential\n\n4\n\nangular brackets stand for the expectation with respect the distribution of random variables\nVi . Our approach is based on the assumption that such a Laplace transform can be efficiently\nfound in the high-temperature phase.\nFollowing [5, 9] we introduce the variable x via p = e\u03b2x and consider the function\nG\u0303(x) = hexp{\u2212e\u03b2x Z\u03b2 }i. Extending the Derrida-Spohn scenario, CLD postulate that in the\nthermodynamic limit M \u226b 1 the latter function has a shape of a travelling wave, that is\nG\u0303(x) = g\u03b2 (x + m\u03b2 (L)),\n\nm\u03b2 (L \u226b 1) \u2248 c(\u03b2)L + l.o.t.,\n\nL = ln M\n\n(3)\n\nwhere we introduced the parameter L to identify with notations used in [9], and l.o.t. stands\nfor the lower order terms when L \u2192 \u221e\u2021. In general, both the travelling wave profile g\u03b2 (y)\nand the wave velocity c(\u03b2) depend on the inverse temperature \u03b2. The REM-like transition in\nthis approach is described by a \"freezing\" of both the velocity and the profile function at a\ncertain transition temperature \u03b2 = \u03b2c so that in the full low-temperature phase \u03b2 \u2265 \u03b2c one\nhas:\ng\u03b2 (y) = g\u03b2c (y),\n\nm\u03b2 (M \u226b 1) \u2248 c(\u03b2c )L + l. o. t.\n\n(4)\n\nBy the very definition of the function G\u0303(x) we then have the following relation for \u03b2 \u2265 \u03b2c :\nhexp{\u2212e\u03b2x Z\u03b2 }i = G\u0303(x)|\u03b2\u2265\u03b2c = g\u03b2c (x + c(\u03b2c )L)\n\n(5)\n\nwhich fixes the shape of the Laplace transform G\u03b2\u2265\u03b2c (p) = hexp{\u2212pZ\u03b2 }i in the whole\ntemperature range below the transition point.\nEquipped with such a scenario, we will exploit that the knowledge of the Laplace\ntransform allows one to calculate the moments of the partition function below the transition\nby employing the standard identity:\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ \u221e\nZ \u221e\n1\n1\n1\ndp p\u03bd\u22121 he\u2212pZ\u03b2 i =\ndp p\u03bd\u22121 g\u03b2c\nln p + c(\u03b2c )L , (6)\nhZ\u03b2\u2212\u03bd i =\n\u0393(\u03bd) 0\n\u0393(\u03bd) 0\n\u03b2\nwhere \u0393(x) stands for the Euler Gamma-function, and we used that x = \u03b21 ln p.\nAccording to the freezing scenario, the mean value of the free energy in the lowtemperature phase is to leading order in L \u226b 1 temperature-independent, and is given by\nhF i = \u2212 \u03b21 hln Z\u03b2 i = \u2212c(\u03b2c )L. Being interested in the fluctuations of the free energy, we\nintroduce the random variable f = F \u2212 hF i whose probability density we denote P\u03b2 (f ). After\nchanging the integration variable in (6) to y = \u03b21 ln p + c(\u03b2c )L, introducing s = \u2212\u03b2\u03bd and\nintegrating once by parts we observe that (6) takes the following form:\n\u0015\n\u0014\nZ \u221e\nZ \u221e\nD\nE\n1\n\u2212sf\n\u2212sy d\n\u2212sf\n\u0011\n\u0010\n(7)\ng\u03b2 (y) dy\ne P\u03b2 (f ) df = \u2212\ne\ne\n\u2261\nf\ndy c\n\u2212\u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n\u0393 1\u2212 s\n\u03b2\n\nThus, the only function needed for investigating the low temperature phase is the shape\nof the travelling wave profile g\u03b2 (y) at the critical point \u03b2 = \u03b2c . For a general non-zero\ntemperature \u03b2c < \u03b2 < \u221e one can extract the explicit form of the free-energy distribution\nP\u03b2 (f ) by noticing that the analytical continuation s \u2192 is converts the relation (7) to a Fourier\ntransform which as we shall shortly see can be frequently inverted explicitly. A particular\nsimple relation is obtained in the zero-temperature limit \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e where the free energy simply\nreduces to the minimum value of all random energies in the sample F \u2192 Vm = mini {Vi }.

On the other hand, the first line in (21) and\nthe expressions (23) yield the probability density of the form P< (Z) in Eq.(25). The crossover\nvalue Z = Z\u2217 is determined from the requirement for the leading exponential terms in the two\npieces of the probability density to match smoothly, i.e. P< (Z\u2217 ) \u2248 P> (Z\u2217 ) for M \u226b 1. The\nfactor f (x) in (26) is assumed to be of order of unity when its argument is of the order of unity,\nand is otherwise left unspecified. Finally, we verify in the Appendix that the choice of P (z) in\nEq.(24) ensures the required change in moments hZ n iM \u226b1 to occur precisely at n = 1/g 2 \u03b2 2 .\nAt the next step we use the probability density (24) for evaluating the Laplace transform\nfunction G\u03b2 (p) in the high-temperature phase. A somewhat lengthy but straightforward\ncalculation reveals that the log-normal tail P> (Z) gives for M \u226b 1 a negligible relative\ncontribution to the Laplace transform, as long as we keep finite the value pZe < \u221e. Effectively,\nit means that for our goals we can assume the partition function Z\u03b2 to be distributed with the\nprobability density P< (Z\u03b2 ) given in Eq.(25). After a simple transformation of variables this\nimplies a rather simple asymptotic formula:\n\u0012\n\nP> (Z) = \u221a\n\nG\u03b2 (p) = he\u2212pZ\u03b2 i|M \u226b1 \u2248\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\ne\u2212t\u2212pZe t dt,\n\u2212a\n\n\u0013\n\na = \u03b2 2 g2 < 1 ,\n\n(27)\n\nUsing such an expression , we can, for example, easily calculate the mean logarithm of the\npartition function, hence the mean free energy:\n\u0014\n\nhln Zi = lim \u0393(\u01eb) \u2212\n\u01eb\u21920\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\n\u0015\n\ndpp\u01eb\u22121 he\u2212pZ\u03b2 i = ln Ze \u2212 a\u0393\u2032 (1) ,\n\nso that the mean free energy is given by\n\u0012\n\u0013\ni\n1\n1\n1 h\n2\nhF i = \u2212 hln Zi = \u2212\n+ \u03b2g ln M \u2212 ln \u0393(1 \u2212 \u03b2 2 g2 ) \u2212 \u03b2g 2 \u0393\u2032 (1),\n\u03b2 2 g2 < 1\n(28)\n\u03b2\n\u03b2\n\u03b2\nThe leading term yields the expected universal REM expression for the mean free energy valid\nin the high-temperature phase, the rest corresponds to system-specific corrections.

Note, that the same result for the free energy can be\nrecovered by the standard replica trick using moments (21).\nThe fluctuations of the free energy around its mean value can be easily recovered as well,\nusing the explicit form of the distribution P< (Z\u03b2 ).

Unfortunately, verification of this\ninteresting prediction goes beyond the precision of our analysis.\n\n\fRandom Energy Model with logarithmically correlated potential\n\n10\n\nwhere we have used the identity[22]:\n\u221e\n\n1+\u03bc\u2212\u03bd\n1+\u03bc+\u03bd\n\u0393\n.\na\n\u0393\np K\u03bd (ap)dp = 2\n2\n2\n0\nSubstituting here the explicit values of \u03b3 and b, and changing \u03bd \u2192 \u2212\u03bd we finally get:\nZ\n\n\u03bd\n\n\u03bc\n\n\u03bc\u22121 \u2212\u03bc\u22121\n\n\u03b2\u03bdm\u2217L\n\nhZ i = e\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n1\n\u03b2\n\u03932 1 \u2212 \u03bd .\n\u0393(1 \u2212 \u03bd)\n\u03b2c\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\n(35)\n\n(36)\n\nAlthough we used \u03bd < 0 in the course of derivation, a slight modification of the above\nprocedure, see [3], shows that the above expression is valid in a wider region, as long as\n\u03bd < \u03b2c /\u03b2 < 1.\nThe mean value of the free energy F in the low-temperature phase is found in a similar way\nand the leading order term is simply hF i = \u2212\u03b2 \u22121 hln Zi = \u2212m\u2217L .

Exploiting the series expansion for the Macdonald function, see\ne.g. p.909 of [22], it is easy to check that in the zero temperature limit \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e the free energy\ndistribution indeed reduces to the extreme value probability density of the form Eq. (2) in full\nagreement with the general relation (8). Eq. (39) shows that the same non-Gumbel behaviour\nholds for the far-left tail f \u2192 \u2212\u221e of the free energy distribution at any temperature below\nthe transition.\n\n3.3. Conclusion, Discussions and Open Problems\nIn the present paper we attempted to investigate some implications of the CLD freezing\nscenario [9] for a particular type of REM-like model with logarithmically correlated random\npotential on a circle. The chosen model seems to be especially attractive due to relatively\nsimple expressions for the integer moments of the partition function in the high-temperature\nphase, given by the well-known Dyson Coulomb gas integral. We argue that in such a case\nthe Laplace transform of the probability density of the partition function can be efficiently\nrecovered. When combined with the freezing scenario this knowledge allows us to continue\nthe Laplace transform to the low-temperature phase. We first check that the method indeed\nworks for the standard REM example by recovering the well-known, yet nontrivial GardnerDerrida formulae[3] for the moments of the partition function below the freezing point. The\nsame method is then applied to the logarithmic model in question. In particular, we are\nable to recover the full distribution of the lowest minimum in the potential, Eq.(2), and this\nextreme-value statistics is manifestly non-Gumbel.\n\n\fRandom Energy Model with logarithmically correlated potential\n\n11\n\nAlthough we think our results are supported by rather convincing arguments, the\ncalculations are very essentially based on a few plausible but not yet fully verified assumptions.\nAs such, mathematically our conclusions have the status of well-grounded conjectures. It would\nbe certainly very desirable to find alternative ways of investigating the model, as well as to\nperform accurate numerical verification of the precise form of the extreme value statistics.\nAnother open problem is the universality of our result, Eq. (2), for logarithmically correlated\nrandom variables, in particular the shape of the right tail (see [17]). We hope our results\nprovide enough incentive for further research in this direction.\nFinally, it might be useful to provide an alternative view on our choice of\nthe logarithmically correlated potential, Eq.(15).\nBy employing the known identity:\n\u0001\nP\u221e 1\n2\n\u2212 ln 4 sin2 x1 \u2212x\n=\n2\ncos\nl(x\n\u2212\nx\n)\nwe\nsee\nthat\nthe\ncovariance function\n(15) represents,\n1\n2\nl=1 l\n2\n\u0010\n\u0011\nin fact, a 2\u03c0-periodic real-valued Gaussian random process V (x) =\n\nP\u221e\n\nvl eilx + v\u0304l e\u2212ilx\n\nl=1\n\nwith a self-similar spectrum hvl v\u0304m i = g2 l\u2212(2H+1) \u03b4lm characterised by the particular choice of\nthe Hurst exponent H = 0. Such a process therefore represents a version of the so-called 1/f\nnoise. To this end it is worth mentioning that the extreme value statistics of the \"roughness\"\nassociated with 1/f noise was investigated in [23], and found to be of Gumbel form.\nAcknowledgements.
