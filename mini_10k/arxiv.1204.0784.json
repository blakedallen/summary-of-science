Therefore it\nis hailed as a unique tool in probing the earliest, prestellar phase of star formation. Observationally,\nits abundance and distribution is however just beginning to be understood in low-mass prestellar and\ncluster-forming cores. In high mass star forming regions, H2 D+ has been detected only in two cores,\nand its spatial distribution remains unknown. Here we present the first map of the ortho-H2 D+ Jk+ ,k\u2212\n= 11,0 \u2192 11,1 and N2 H+ 4-3 transition in the DR21 filament of Cygnus-X with the JCMT, and\nN2 D+ 3\u20132 and dust continuum with the SMA.

INTRODUCTION\n\nIn their evolution toward the formation of a young stellar object, low\u2013mass cloud cores change their density distribution until the so\u2013called \"pivotal\" state is reached\n(e.g. Shu et al. 1987). This stage is considered the starting point for protostellar accretion. Thus, it is crucial\nto find and study objects close to the \"pivotal\" stage to\nunveil the initial conditions in the process of star formation. We believe to have found this class of objects:\nthey are the so\u2013called prestellar cores, characterised by\ncentral densities of \u223c 106 cm\u22123 , centrally concentrated\ndensity profiles, and with clear signs of contraction in the\ncentral few thousand AU (Caselli et al. 2002a,b; Crapsi\net al. 2004, 2005). They stand out in having large degrees\nof CO freeze\u2013out and deuterium fractionation (Bacmann\net al. 2003). In particular, they show strong emission\nin the Jk+ ,k\u2212 = 11,0 \u2192 11,1 line of ortho-H2 D+ in the\ncase of L1544, the prototypical low-mass prestellar core\n(Caselli et al. 2003). In this object, the H2 D+ line has\nbeen mapped by Vastel et al. (2006) and found to be extended over a region of \u223c5000 AU in projected radius. A\nH2 D+ survey was conducted in low\u2013mass cores (Caselli\net al. 2008) and revealed a decrease in fractional abundance of ortho-H2 D+ in protostellar cores as compared to\nElectronic address: tpillai@astro.caltech.edu\n1 California Institute of Technology, Cahill Center for Astronomy\nand Astrophysics, Pasadena, CA 91125, USA: Current Address\n2 Center for Astrophysics, 60 Garden Street, Cambridge, MA\n02138, USA where a significant part of this work was done\n3 School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Leeds, Leeds\nLS2 9JT, UK\n4 Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology,\n4800 Oak Grove Drive, Pasadena, CA 91109, USA\n5 Centre for Astrophysics Research, Science and Technology Research Institute, University of Hertfordshire, Herts AL10 9AB, UK\n\nstarless cores.\nTo reproduce the past observations towards low-mass\ncores, which imply abundances of H2 D+ close to 10\u22129\nw.r.t. H2 , one needs to have species such as CO (which\ndestroy H2 D+ ) almost completely frozen onto dust grains\n(e.g. Walmsley et al. 2004; Roberts et al. 2004). This can\nbe achieved only if the dust temperature is low (Tdust <\n20 K) and the density is large (n[H2 ] \u2265 105 cm\u22123 ). At\nthese conditions, all species quickly condense out (with\ntime scales \u223c109 yr (n[H2 ]/cm\u22123 )\u22121 , leaving mainly He,\nH2 and its daughter species (in particular H+\n3 and its\ndeuterated forms, including H2 D+ ) in the gas phase.\nTherefore, H2 D+ observations are a unique tool to trace\nand study the chemistry and kinematics of the high density nucleus of prestellar cores, the future stellar cradle.\nThat being said about low-mass star formation, the\nearly phase chemistry in massive star forming regions\nis still poorly understood, mainly because the study of\nthese regions have so far focused on molecular material associated with high mass protostellar objects (e.g.\nBeuther et al. 2002), which are actively altering gas and\ndust properties. Based on our wide-field (10\u00d710 arcmin)\ncensus of clouds in 32 massive star-forming regions, harboring UCHii regions, we discovered a new sample of\nmassive pre-protocluster cores. Our program is known\nas SCAMPS (the SCUBA Massive Pre/Protocluster core\nSurvey; Thompson et al. 2005). Many of the sources\nare seen as dark patches in infrared images of the region. As a result these clumps must have dust temperatures below 30 K (as evidenced by mid-IR upper limits)\nand have masses of a few 100 to 1000 M\u2299 . These mmpeak/mid-infrared absorption sources are very promising\ncandidates for being high mass pre-protocluster cores.\n\n\f2\n\nPillai et al.\n\nWe started investigating these pre-protocluster cores\nin more detail by observing them in NH3 with the Effelsberg 100 m telescope, as well as in deuterated NH3 with\nthe IRAM 30m telescope(Pillai et al. 2007). On average, the derived temperatures are around 15 K compared\nwith average temperatures toward the previously studied more evolved High Mass Protostellar Objects (HMPOs, Sridharan et al. 2002) of 22 K. Finally, depletion\nand very large deuterium fractionation, [NH2 D]/[NH3 ]\n\u223c 0.2, are found (Pillai et al. 2007, Pillai et al. 2011),\nan enhancement of \u2248 104 over the cosmic D/H ratio.\nWith gas masses of the order of a few hundred M\u2299 ,\nhigh deuteration, depletion, and cold temperatures, these\nsources feature many characteristics expected for massive\npre-protocluster cores. Similar large values of the deuterium fraction have been found toward quiescent cores\nembedded in Infrared Dark Clouds (IRDCs; Chen et al.\n2010, Fontani et al. 2011). However see also other recent deuteration studies in IRDCs (Miettinen et al. 2011,\nSakai et al. 2012).\nWith the JCMT and SMA we observed the ortho\u2013\nH2 D+ (11,0 \u201311,1 ), N2 D+ 3\u20132, and N2 H+ 4\u20133 line towards\nthree cores from our sample. Here we report detection\nof the ortho\u2013H2 D+ (11,0 \u201311,1 ) line and its large -scale\nemission in one of the three cores (the only core where\northo\u2013H2 D+ was detected) and subsequent mapping of\nthe deuterated region in N2 D+ 3\u20132 line with SMA.\n2. SOURCE SELECTION\n\nThe JCMT observations were initially targeted towards three objects from the SCAMPS survey with the\nbrightest NH2 D detections. In total 23.8 hours were\nspent on the project on the three sources. After few hours\nof integration on each of the three targets which did not\nresult in a detection, we decided to perform deeper integration on G81.74+0.59, since we detected the brightest\nNH2 D line towards it in our previous IRAM 30m survey (Pillai et al. 2007). Here, we only discuss the observations towards G81.74+0.59. The maps presented\nhere correspond to clumps along the DR21 filament \u223c 2\u2032\nnorth of the well known DR21(OH) massive young stellar object. The DR21 filament itself is the most massive\nregion in the entire complex. Our mapped region coincides with three bright 1.3 mm MAMBO dust continuum\npeaks as revealed in a large scale survey of Cygnus-X\n(Motte et al. 2007). For reference, this region encompasses the massive dense core N53 of Motte et al. survey\n(see also Bontemps et al. 2010, Csengeri et al. 2011) and\nFIR 1/2/3 in infrared studies of this region (Chandler\net al. 1993, Kumar et al. 2007). The embedded population identified by Kumar et al. is shown as stars in\nFig.1.\n3. SMA AND JCMT OBSERVATIONS\n\nJCMT N2 H+ and H2 D+ observations were carried out\nin service mode in several sessions starting August 2007\nto August 2008 with the HARP instrument on JCMT.\nHARP is the heterodyne multi-pixel array at JCMT\nequipped with 16 receptors separated by 30 arcsec with\na foot print of 2 arcmin. The beam size of each receptor\nis \u224814 \u2032\u2032 . Nyquist sampled maps were achieved using a\njiggle pattern with a position-switch to move to the reference. During most of our observations, 14 of the 16\nreceptors were working. After finding evidence of emis-\n\nsion at the edge of our map from the initial observing\nsession, we shifted the map center for the subsequent sessions. The pointing accuracy was on average < 3 \u2032\u2032 , and\nthe median system temperature at the H2 D+ frequency\nwas 579 K. The smurf software provided as a part of the\nStarlink package was used to regrid the data, mask the\nbad receptors, construct 3D data cubes, and co-add the\nscans. The data were then converted to fits and analysed\nin CLASS 6 .\nThe Submillimeter Array (SMA7 ) N2 D+ and continuum observations were made with all eight antennas in\nthe most compact configuration (sub-compact) in two\ntracks in August and September 2008. The observations\nwere done in track sharing mode with several sources per\ntrack. For G81.74+0.59, we had four pointings separated\nat less than half a (primary) beam spacing to cover the\nsame region as the JCMT HARP footprint at 230 and\n279 GHz respectively. The 230 GHz receiver was tuned to\nthe CO (2\u20131) line in the spectral band s13 of the USB for\nthe N2 D+ observations. We used a non-uniform correlator configuration to have a higher spectral resolution of\n\u223c 0.2 km s\u22121 for the chunks covering the N2 D+ and CO\nline. The rest of the correlator was set to \u223c 0.4 km s\u22121 .\nThe data were taken under very good weather conditions\n(< 1mm water vapor), and the typical system temperatures were 100 K. The gain calibrator was MWC349a,\n\u223c 2 \u25e6 away from the target position. Uranus and 3C454.3\nwere used as the flux and bandpass calibrator, respectively. Flux calibration is based on SMA flux monitoring of the observed planet and is estimated to be accurate to within 20%. The primary beam at 230 GHz is \u223c\n51\u2032\u2032 . The data calibration was done in MIR, an IDL based\ncalibration package, and then exported to MIRIAD and\nGILDAS for further data reduction which included continuum subtraction, and imaging. The center of the final image of the mosaic, the 1 \u03c3 rms noise level achieved\nin the continuum images, and the resulting synthesized\nbeam for all observations is listed in Table 1.\n4. RESULTS\n4.1. H2 D+ Clumps\n\nThe detection of JCMT H2 D+ is at a modest signal-tonoise (S/N) with five confirmed S/N peaks (5, 6, 7, 7 and\n9 \u03c3) for a smoothed velocity resolution of \u223c 0.2 km s\u22121 ,\ntherefore we obtained only source candidates. In Fig.1,\nthe S/N map obtained (after baseline subtraction) is\nshown. To increase the S/N for the peak positions, we\nsmoothed the original JCMT map using a symmetrical Gaussian PSF with a full-width at half-maximum\n(FWHM) of two pixels, evaluated over a length of 10\npixels. 80% of the pixels in the inner 90 \u00d7 90 \u2032\u2032 of the\nmap shown in Fig.1 have rms noise between 0.013 and\n0.021 K. This resulted in our final map presented here\nwith a FWHM beam of 19.7 \u2032\u2032 . The > 3\u03c3 detections\nin the S/N map were then confirmed by visualisation\nof spectra in the smoothed map, and subsequent S/N\nanalysis on Gaussian fits to the spectra. Similarly, three\nother > 3\u03c3 detections (also seen in Fig.1 for example\n6\n\nhttp://www.iram.fr/IRAMFR/GILDAS/\nThe Submillimeter Array is a joint project between the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory and the Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, and is funded by the Smithsonian Institution and the Academia Sinica.\n7\n\n\fH2 D+ in a high mass star-forming region\nthe contour between P4, P1 and P3) were rejected by\nvisualisation of spectra. These might well be true detections, however requires validation with deeper observations. Following these steps, we have confirmed five reliable detections (labelled P1 to P5) whose positional offsets and Gaussian fit parameters (obtained with CLASS)\nis tabulated in Table 2. The N2 H+ (4-3) line parameters\nfor data smoothed to the same spatial resolution is also\ngiven in the same table. The spectra towards the five\npositions for both lines are shown in Fig.2. The spectra\nhave been converted from antenna temperature to main\nbrightness temperature for a main beam efficiency of 0.63\n(from the JCMT HARP web page).\n4.2. Spectral Line Features\n+\n\nThe H2 D , N2 H+ and N2 D+ spectral line parameters\ntowards the five H2 D+ peaks are reported in Table 2. We\nalso provide the non-thermal line width for these species\nafter taking away the contribution due to thermal broadening at 15 K.\nThe H2 D+ line towards even the brightest core (say\nP1) at offset (37 \u2032\u2032 , 44 \u2032\u2032 ) is only modest at 0.18 K.\nOur brightest line is still fainter than the weakest H2 D+\ndetection towards low-mass starless and prestellar cores\nreported so far (for a complete list see Caselli et al.\n2008). The LSR velocity towards the northern sources\n(P1, P2, P3) is systematically offset from those of the\nsouthern cores (P4, P5). We find a range in line widths\nof 0.8 < \u2206v/kms\u22121 < 1.6. The thermal line width\n(FWHM) at 15 K is 0.4 km s\u22121 . Clearly, the line width\nhas a significant non-thermal component as expected in\nsuch protocluster environments (also given in Table 2)\n. Though it is difficult to assess the line profiles at the\ngiven S/N, a double-peaked profile is observed towards\nP4. The line asymmetry might be due to different velocity components along the line of sight, absorption in\nthe core envelope or infall motions (as argued by van der\nTak et al. 2005 where a similar H2 D+ profile is observed\nin L1544). Clearly, high spatial resolution observations\nare required to clarify this.\nThe 4\u20133 line of N2 H+ line is very bright (> 2 K) and\nbroad (\u2265 1.5 km s\u22121 ) towards all the five offset positions. This transition has over 40 hyperfine lines within\n< 5 km s\u22121 . The N2 D+ 3\u20132 transition also has hyperfine\nstructure (hfs) spread over 7 km s\u22121 . However this is below our detection limit for all H2 D+ peaks. Also, the S/N\nfor N2 D+ spectra towards H2 D+ peaks is poor. Therefore, we refrain from any interpretation of the N2 D+\nspectra. H2 D+ is much lighter than N2 D+ and N2 H+\n(factor of 7) and hence the thermal line broadening is\nsignificant. The thermal line width (FWHM) at 15 K\nis 0.41 km s\u22121 for H2 D+ , much larger than 0.15 km s\u22121\nfor N2 H+ and N2 D+ . However, in Cygnus-X, the nonthermal contribution is still dominant. As listed in Table 2, the intrinsic (i.e. taking the hfs structure into\naccount) line widths of three species are different. Excluding P4 (where the N2 H+ and H2 D+ line widths are\nequal), H2 D+ line width is lower than that of N2 H+ and\nmight imply that deuterated molecules preferably trace\nquiescent gas. The mean difference in line width for the\nH2 D+ \u2013 N2 H+ pair is 0.52(\u00b10.48). i.e. the higher N2 H+\nline width with respect to H2 D+ is only marginally significant.\n\n3\n\nThe N2 H+ LSR velocity is consistently red shifted relative to that of H2 D+ and magnitude of this shift varies\nfrom 0.2 to 0.6 km s\u22121 .\n4.3. H2 D+ , N2 D+ , N2 H+ and Thermal Dust Continuum\n\nThe dust continuum emission at high (1.3 mm SMA,\n\u223c 3.8 \u2032\u2032 ) and coarser (1.3 mm MAMBO, \u223c 11 \u2032\u2032 ) angular resolution is shown in panels A and B of Fig.1. The\nMAMBO clumps fragment further with significant structure all along the filament. The subsequent panels in the\nfigure show the gas distribution in three different tracers: H2 D+ , N2 D+ and N2 H+ . There is very good correlation between thermal dust continuum and N2 H+ emission with the brightest N2 H+ emission coinciding with\nthe bright MAMBO peaks (panel D). However, there is\nno such one to one correlation of dust continuum with\neither N2 D+ (panel C) or H2 D+ emission (panels B, C\nand D).\nH2 D+ is concentrated in five clumps distributed\naround the massive protocluster (panel B Fig.1). However, no H2 D+ emission is seen towards any of the bright\nand dense dust cores seen with MAMBO/SMA. Conversely, no compact continuum is detected for H2 D+\ncores. The H2 D+ distribution coincides with our SMA\nN2 D+ 3\u20132 observations, however their peaks do not. Instead the N2 D+ cores are distributed in further clumpy\nstructures offset and partially surrounding the H2 D+\npeaks. Furthermore, there is one H2 D+ peak (P1) with\nno associated N2 D+ emission, and several N2 D+ cores\nwith no corresponding H2 D+ emission. As seen in the\nfourth panel of Fig.1, there is always extended N2 H+\nemission associated with H2 D+ cores.\n4.4. ortho-H2 D+ and N2 H+ abundance\n\nThe ortho-H2 D+ column density for the different cores\nhave been estimated following Vastel et al. 2006 from\nthe main beam brightness temperature, line width and\nassuming an excitation temperature (TEX ) of 10 K. The\nH2 D+ line is optically thin in all cores (\u226a 1) and the\nassumed TEX also enters the optical depth estimation\nfollowing equation 4 of Vastel et al. 2006. Therefore, we\nnote that the derived H2 D+ column density crucially depends on the assumption of excitation temperature. A\n30% decrease in TEX lower than 10 K is poorly justified. Pillai et al. (2007) estimate a ammonia rotational\ntemperature of 18 K in the vicinity of P4 (within 40 \u2032\u2032 ).\nThe presence of H2 D+ emission together with the lack of\n24\u03bcm emission towards the H2 D+ cores rules out much\nhigher gas temperatures (\u226b 20 K). In their H2 D+ sample of prestellar and protostellar cores, Caselli et al. find\non average 3 K higher kinetic temperatures and higher\nTEX for their protostellar cores as their prestellar cores\n(8 K vs 11 K). Friesen et al. 2010 also find a higher (than\nprestellar cores) TEX of 12 K to be appropriate for their\nlow-mass cluster-forming core in Ophiucus.\nMAMBO 1.3 mm data smoothed to the resolution of\nthe final JCMT data have been used to determine H2\ncolumn density for a 15 K kinetic temperature following\nKauffmann et al. (2008). We have used a dust opacity of\n0.0102 cm2 /g for dust grains with thin ice mantles and\ngas density n(H) = 106 cm\u22123 as in Ossenkopf & Henning\n(1994). The ortho-H2 D+ column density and the resulting H2 D+ abundances are reported in Table 3. The ratio\n\n\f4\n\nPillai et al.\n\nbetween column density towards cores studied here and\nthose observed towards low-mass cores (summarised in\nTable 3 of Caselli et al. 2008) varies from 1 to 13.\nAs mentioned before, the N2 H+ hyperfine structure\ncontribute significantly to the broadening of the line. We\nfit the N2 H+ hyperfines (METHOD HFS in CLASS) and\nFWHM so obtained is much lower than from a GAUSS\nfit (Table 2, Gerin et al. 2001). The optical depth,\nand therefore the excitation temperature which is usually otherwise derived based on optical depth and line\nbrightness is uncertain. Hence the choice of excitation\ntemperature is somewhat arbitrary and is based on observations in literature. For example, Fontani et al. (2008)\nderive excitation temperature close to 6 K value towards\nN2 H+ cores in a high mass star forming region. Assuming optically thin condition, we have estimated the\ncolumn density from the integrated intensity of N2 H+\n4 \u2212 3 lines following Caselli et al. 2002c for an excitation\ntemperature of 5 K. The total N2 H+ abundance is tabulated in Table 3. The uncertainties given in brackets are\nformal errors obtained by a Gaussian error propagation.\n5. DISCUSSION\n\nWhile some of the results discussed above are intuitively easy to understand, many are not. In this section\nwe attempt to explain these anomalies and thus characterise the physical conditions.\nThe bright MAMBO sources are actively forming stars\nand clusters (Kumar et al. 2007), as also evidenced by\ntheir mid-infrared (mid-IR) emission. Higher temperatures, and subsequent release of heavy neutrals (CO)\nfrom grain mantles destroy H2 D+ and therefore reduce\nthe deuterium reservoir in such bright cores. For example, from NH2 D observations we find clear evidence\nof the peak being offsets from the bright cores showing\nstar formation activity (Pillai et al. 2011). The colder\nsecondary cores on the other hand are expected to have\nabundant deuterated species. Are these secondary cores\nprincipally seen in H2 D+ emission representative of the\nprestellar/cluster gas?\n5.1. Extent of H2 D+ emission\n\nThe most surprising element of our observation is the\nwide-spread emission of H2 D+ with no direct counterpart in previous dust continuum or line measurements\n(continuum data from Motte et al. 2007 and line data\nfrom Csengeri et al. 2011). The H2 D+ emission is instead distributed in cores around the bright continuum\ncores over a \u223c 1 pc region. The individual cores have\non average diameter of 0.2 pc roughly estimated by fitting ellipses by eye (34000 AU, P4 and P5 are smaller).\nThis is more than twice the extent of H2 D+ emission observed towards the only two regions previously mapped\nin H2 D+ ; the low-mass prestellar core in Taurus (L1544;\nVastel et al. 2006) and the low-mass cluster-forming core\nin Ophiucus (OphB2; Friesen et al. 2010).\nIn the past, H2 D+ was thought to trace the innermost\nregions (few 1000 AU) of a dense core where all the heavier molecules deplete on to grain mantles with density\nexceeding 106 cm\u22123 (di Francesco et al. 2007). However, with newer data on the collisional rate of H2 D+\nthe critical density of the transition has been corrected\nto \u223c 105 cm\u22123 , an order of magnitude lower than previously assumed (Caselli et al. 2008). Combined with the\n\nprevalent cold temperature in such dense cores, this implies that the H2 D+ distribution is expected to be much\nlarger (\u226b 7000 AU). The extent of H2 D+ distribution in\nOphB2 or L1544 can then be comprehended. However,\nit is surprising that in Cyg-X this distribution is twice\nas large. Mapping of the entire DR21 filament is likely\nto discover more such cold quiescent gas pockets in an\notherwise active high mass star-forming region.\n5.2. Absence of Dust Continuum peaks towards\n\northo-H2 D+ peaks\nAlthough there is weaker dust emission towards all\nH2 D+ cores, none of the H2 D+ peaks have been detected\nas a peak in dust continuum emission with MAMBO as\nwell as SMA. Depletion is often invoked to explain such\nlack of correlation between dust and gas in different tracers. However, the molecule in question is H2 D+ , one of\nthe lightest deuterated ions that should survive depletion. Therefore, we suggest that dust continuum observation is partially misleading, i.e. not tracing mass distribution. We assert this by showing that H2 D+ emission\ncomes from a region of low temperature and high density.\nWe draw out the density in three different ways. First,\nlet us define a spherical core around a H2 D+ core, for e.g.\nP1. It has a mass of 137 M\u2299 within a radius of \u223c 0.1 pc\nfrom MAMBO observations for a temperature of 15 K.\nThis implies an average density of 5 \u00d7 106 cm\u22123 . Second,\nwe extract the intensity of the filament in dust emission towards an intensity minima in between two bright\nMAMBO cores, considerably offset from the H2 D+ cores\nand outside its 3 \u03c3 boundary. Adopting the distance\nto the extreme ends of two H2 D+ cores boundary as a\nmeasure of the size of a typical core, in this case 60 arcsec, we again derive density (2 \u00d7 105 cm\u22123 ). The critical density of the observed H2 D+ transition at 20 K is\n\u223c 1.1\u00d7105 cm\u22123 . This shows that the density in a region\nlarger than the H2 D+ core by a factor of \u223c 60/20 = 3\n(20 arcsec corresponds to representative H2 D+ core size)\nis still high enough to get H2 D+ excited. Finally, N2 H+\n4\u20133 emission is observed all along the filament including\ntowards H2 D+ cores. The critical density 8 of this N2 H+\ntransition at 3 \u00d7 107 cm\u22123 is two orders of magnitude\nhigher than that of the H2 D+ transition, requiring very\ndense gas. Clearly not every region (like the envelope)\nin the filament can have such high densities or the implied high excitation temperature, and the line is likely\nsub-thermally excited (Evans 1999). We therefore used\nthe non-LTE radiative transfer code RADEX 9 for a simple\ncalculation of the expected N2 H+ 4\u20133 line brightness for\na column density of 1015 cm\u22122 and line width (FWHM)\nof 2 km s\u22121 at 20 K for a wide range of densities (guided\nby N2 H+ line parameters for the H2 D+ cores given in Table 2 \u2013 3). We are thus able to rule out densities below\n105 cm\u22123 for the H2 D+ cores.\nNext, we look at the maximum temperature of the\nH2 D+ emitting region. H2 D+ cores are mid-IR-quiet\nat 24\u03bcm, while the bright MAMBO cores have bright\n24\u03bcm point like emission as observed with the MIPS\ninstrument on Spitzer telescope (Spitzer Legacy Pro8 Derived based on N H+ collisional rate from LAMDA database\n2\nfor a temperature of 20 K (Sch\u00f6ier et al. 2005).\n9 van der Tak et al. (2007)\n\n\fH2 D+ in a high mass star-forming region\ngram ID 40184, PI J. Hora), consistent with the notion\nthat these bright objects are massive protostars (Chandler et al. 1993). A precise luminosity of these protostars is difficult to measure because the sources are saturated. Based on a single temperature Spectral Energy\nDistribution (SED) fit to their Far-Infrared(FIR) and\n1.3 mm data, Chandler et al. have determined the luminosity of one of the protostars in the region (known as\nFIR1) to be \u223c 1860 L\u2299 (this value has been corrected\nfor our adopted distance of 1.7 kpc instead of 3 kpc).\nGiven the poor spatial resolution of the IRAS data, the\nindividual protostars would in any case not be distinguished. We find two sources from the Red MSX Source\n(RMS) survey of a large sample of massive young stellar objects from the MSX point source catalog in our\nfield (Hoare et al. 2005,Urquhart et al. 2008). The survey database at www.ast.leeds.ac.uk/RMS characterises\nthe luminosity of the two sources, G081.7522+00.5906,\nG081.7624+00.5916 as 2500 and 1000 L\u2299 respectively\n(Mottram et al. 2011). Assuming that FIR1/2/3 are in\nsimilar stages of evolution, we adopt 1000 L\u2299 as a conservative estimate of the protostellar luminosity. The\nmass-weighted dust temperature within an aperture of\nradius R is approximated using Eq. (8) of Kauffmann\net al. (2008). That equation assumes a simplified dust\ntemperature dependence on radius and luminosity (i.e.,\ncalibrated by Terebey et al. 1993; Td \u221d L0.2 /r0.4 ), but\nfurther requires temperatures \u2265 10 K. Assuming a density profile \u033a \u221d r\u22122 , these temperatures are then weighed\nby mass to obtain the mean temperature (e.g., Belloche\net al. 2006). Following Eqs. (5), (8) from Kauffmann\net al. (2008), the temperature at a radius of 30000 AU\n(\u223c 17 \u2032\u2032 ) from the protostar would drop to 15 K. Here,\nthe exact value of the radius is not relevant but within\nreasonable distance of the protostar the dust should be\ncold, a requisite for H2 D+ emission.\nSo far we have shown that high density and low temperature - a necessary condition for H2 D+ excitation -\nis satisfied in an extended region around the protostars.\nTherefore, the cores seen in H2 D+ need not necessarily\ncorrespond to a 3D maximum in density. To the extent\nof the validity of our first order calculations here in terms\nof effect or protostellar luminosity on heating, it is not\nrequired to have a density peak towards the H2 D+ peaks.\nIf we were to do more elaborate calculations to derive the\ndensity structure, then a density peak would have enhanced the cooling within the peak. However, the H2 D+\npeaks might well correspond to a temperature minima.\nWe intend to investigate this via NH3 measurements.\nWhy are the H2 D+ cores not detected in SMA 1.3 mm\ndust continuum? The SMA continuum distribution is\noffset from the H2 D+ peaks. Recall however that the\nH2 D+ peaks need not be density peaks. Therefore the\nfact that the dust peaks are offset is not inconsistent\nwith the H2 D+ observations. Even so, it is worth noting that all H2 D+ cores are widely associated with SMA\ndust continuum peaks, i.e. offset from rather than being anti-correlated with continuum peaks. Based on the\n1.3 mm MAMBO data we calculated the total mass of\nthe H2 D+ cores. We derive the gas mass at 15 K from\nthe 1.3 mm following Kauffmann et al. (2008), using dust\nopacities at 1.3 mm (0.0102 cm2 /g) for dust grains with\nthin ice mantles and gas density n(H) = 106 cm\u22123 as in\n\n5\n\nOssenkopf & Henning 1994, and gas to dust ratio of 100.\nThe mass estimate is uncertain by a factor of 2 mainly\ndue to the uncertain dust opacity. The typical mass of a\nH2 D+ core is \u223c 130 M\u2299 . However, we find that \u2264 10%\nmass resides in the cores detected with SMA. The missing matter might be either dense but smooth structures\nfiltered out by an interferometer like the SMA. This is\nvalidated by our N2 D+ SMA data. It is contaminated by\nnegative bowls (see third panel of Fig 1). This unwanted\nfeature of synthesis array observations is a signature left\nby very extended objects which dominate the short spacings in the uv plane. Alternatively, a cluster of low mass\ncores well below the sensitivity limit of the array would\nalso explain the missing matter.\nGiven that 90% of the dust emission is missing in\nthe SMA data, the lack of a one-to-one correlation between SMA continuum and H2 D+ might not be significant. For example, consider the dust emission associated\nwith clump P1. We know that \u223c 90% of the dust emission is filtered out with SMA. If the structure is smooth,\nthen this \u223c 90% emission could be randomly removed\nfrom any position in clump P1. Therefore the remaining emission might also be located at a random position\nwithin P1. Moreover, the offset between SMA dust and\nH2 D+ peaks is suggestive of density not being the only\ncriteria to have H2 D+ peaks where they are observed.\nIf it would have been the case, then naturally the peak\nwith the highest density would be least likely to filtered\nout by SMA. Therefore we believe that the H2 D+ peaks\nmight be dominated by temperature effects. The dust\nmight be significantly cooler than in the surroundings\n(and definitely cooler than at the bright dust continuum\npeaks, where protostars are embedded). A similar reasoning was proposed by Di Francesco et al. (2004) who\nfound that interferometric observations of N2 H+ actually\nbetrayed the presence of a dense and cold starless core\nN6 in Oph A with no distinct peak observed in mm dust\ncontinuum observations.\nWe have derived the virial mass of the H2 D+ cores\nfollowing Bertoldi & McKee 1992. For a mean radius of\n0.1 pc and FWHM \u2206v = 1.2 km s\u22121 , the virial mass of a\nH2 D+ core is 30 M\u2299 . The average virial mass is 28 M\u2299 ,\nvery small compared to the mass derived from MAMBO\nobservations. Therefore these cores are gravitationally\nsuper-critical. The line width is highly supersonic (>\n1 km s\u22121 ), for all but one core (P4). The high line-width\nis another indication of a clumpy substructure within\neach H2 D+ emitting region.\n5.3. Absence of N2 D+ peaks towards ortho-H2 D+ peaks\n\nAs noted before, while N2 D+ emission as observed at\nhigh angular resolution with SMA is widely associated\nwith H2 D+ , the peaks of these two ions however do not\ncoincide. Lack of N2 D+ emission towards P2 is at least\npartially due to the problem of short spacing discussed in\nSection 5.2. Briefly, if the N2 D+ emission is as extended\nas the observed H2 D+ emission, then a significant fraction of this emission is likely to be filtered out by the\nSMA. We intend to pursue single dish observations to\naddress this issue. Two cases deserve more attention\nand are discussed here. First, N2 D+ is seen to skirt the\nH2 D+ emission in non-uniform clumpy structures except\nin the case of P2. The critical density for the 3\u20132 transitions of this line is an order of magnitude higher than our\n\n\f6\n\nPillai et al.\n\nH2 D+ transition. This implies that higher density is a\nrequisite for its excitation. We have also shown that the\nH2 D+ peaks at low resolution need not be density peaks.\nThe SMA continuum cores however should point us towards the highest density compact cores in the vicinity\nof H2 D+ emission. It is exactly here that N2 D+ emission\nis concentrated.\nNext, two of the N2 D+ clumps in the south-west part\nof the region are devoid of H2 D+ emission. It is difficult to understand why there are N2 D+ cores with no\nH2 D+ emission. Here, however excitation might play a\nrole. Also, given that the SMA data is prone to artifacts due to the uncertainties inherent in interferometric\nobservations, these structures might be spurious. However, we downloaded published and archived H13 CO+ 1\u2013\n0 PdBI taken at similar resolution to our SMA observations. The region is known as MDC N53 (Csengeri et al.\n2011). Clearly, there is H13 CO+ emission towards all the\nN2 D+ features including the two features not detected in\nH2 D+ . The peak N2 D+ and H13 CO+ line brightness are\nhowever much weaker (more than a factor of 4) toward\nthese N2 D+ cores. If the same scaling of line brightnesses\nis applied to H2 D+ , then it is evident why H2 D+ is not\ndetected (our highest H2 D+ S/N is 8).\n5.4. Depletion of N-bearing molecules\nWe will now discuss the distribution of N2 H+ and\nH2 D+ . At the low temperature of molecular clouds\n(T< 20 K), H2 D+ is the primary ion for deuterium\ntransfer to other molecules including N2 , which produces\nN2 D+ . Therefore, colder cores exhibit high deuteration\nas seen in the fractionation of molecules like N2 H+ , i.e\nhigh [N2 D+ ]/[N2 H+ ]. However, at such low temperatures molecules freeze out onto dust grains. This not\nonly includes CO and its derivatives like HCO+ but also\nN-bearing molecules like N2 (and consequently N2 H+\nand NH3 , which are both formed by molecular nitrogen). H2 D+ on the other hand can become abundant\nunder such conditions where all heavy species have disappeared (depleted). To test this, we looked at the abundance distribution of N2 H+ over the region. While the\naverage N2 H+ abundance of H2 D+ cores is 1 \u00d7 10\u22128 ,\nno significant variation from those position offset from\nH2 D+ cores is found. The highest abundance is found\ntowards the MAMBO bright peaks which are however\nhigher by only a factor of \u223c 2. Given that our resolution is no finer than 34000 AU, this result is not surprising. Stronger depletion might well be observed on much\nsmaller spatial scales. While the estimated N2 H+ abundance of \u223c 10\u22128 might seem significantly higher than\nthat found in low-mass star forming regions with typical\nabundance of \u223c 10\u221210 (Caselli et al. 2002a, Keto et al.\n2004), we caution that the somewhat arbitrary choice of\nTEX (5 K) influences this calculation. The higher column\ndensities characteristic of high mass star forming regions\nmight explain the high abundance, however a TEX higher\nby 2 K is sufficient to lower the derived abundance by one\norder of magnitude.\n5.5. Deuterium Chemistry\nHow does the observed ortho-H2 D+ abundance compare to existing chemical models? Given the poor spatial\nresolution of our H2 D+ observations, a tailored chemical model is not warranted. Qualitative comparisons can\n\nstill be made with models that have focused on the H2 D+\nchemistry in dark clouds (Walmsley et al. 2004, Flower\net al. 2004). To do this, we need to convert the observed\northo-H2 D+ abundance to the total H2 D+ abundance\nassuming an ortho-to-para (o/p) ratio for H2 D+ . Few\nobservations have constrained this value in dark clouds\n(\u2243 0.8 in L1544 Vastel et al. 2006). Assuming an o/pH2 D+ ratio as in L1544, we get a total H2 D+ abundance\nof \u223c 3 \u00d7 10\u221211 . However, if the gas temperature is even a\nfew degree warmer than in low-mass star forming regions,\nthen the o/p-H2 D+ would drop \u2013 as shown in Figure 6 of\nFlower et al. (2004). This is mainly due to dependence\nof o/p-H2 D+ on o/p-H2 , and an increase in ortho-H2 as\nshown by chemical models (Pagani et al. 1992). Such a\ndrop in the ortho-H2 D+ column density was already noticed by Caselli et al. (2008) toward warmer starless cores\nand protostellar cores in their sample with higher deuterium fractionation (RD ). We do not have temperature\nor RD measurements towards all the H2 D+ cores. However, Pillai et al. (2007) estimate a high rotational temperature of 18 K in the vicinity of P4 (within 40 \u2032\u2032 ) and\nRD = 0.34 where RD is measured as the ratio of NH2 D\nto NH3 column density. This corresponds to a o/p-H2 D+\nratio of about 0.6 (from Fig. 6 of Flower et al. 2004).\nWe also compared our ortho-H2 D+ abundance to the dynamical model of Flower et al. (2006) that incorporates\ndeuterium chemistry in the early stages of protostellar\ncollapse, specifically their Figure 6 where ortho-H2 D+\nabundance at 10 K is plotted as a function of the gas\ndensity during collapse. For a density of \u223c 5 \u00d7 105 cm\u22123\no/p-H2 close to 0.03 is consistent with our observations.\nAn o/p-H2 of << 1 that we indirectly infer is consistent\nwith those measured in nearby low mass star forming\nregions. Observations of deuterated molecules with its\nparent molecule for e.g. DCO+ /HCO+ (Maret & Bergin\n2007), N2 D+ N2 H+ (Pagani et al. 2009), non-LTE radiative transfer modeling of H2 CO absorption (Troscompt\net al. 2009), abundance ratio of Nitrogen hydrides (Dislaire et al. 2012) have all delivered o/p-H2 of << 0.1.\nThis implies that the para-H2 dominates in molecular\nclouds. Similar work in high mass star forming region is\nyet to be done. Detailed modeling should be made with\nhigher resolution data together with tighter constraints\non the density and temperature in Cygnus-X.\n5.6. H2 D+ emission in high and low-mass star forming\n\nregions\nWe present here the first map of H2 D+ distribution\nin a high mass star forming region. Previously, single\nspectra of H2 D+ have been reported in at least two such\nregions, OriB9, a 100 M\u2299 cold, quiescent core in OrionB (Harju et al. 2006) and \u223c 4 \u03c3 detection in a core\nin IRDC MSX G030.88+00.13 (Swift 2009). The orthoH2 D+ abundance in Cygnus-X is in between the values\nfor OriB9 (\u223c 10\u221210 ) and IRDCs \u223c 10\u221213 . However,\nCygnus-X is also intermediate between these two regions\nin terms of its distance from us. Therefore, the extreme\nrange in H2 D+ abundance might merely reflect the effect of beam dilution. However, the line width of our\nH2 D+ cores are similar to the core in G030.88+00.13\n(0.9 km s\u22121 ), and a factor of two higher than in OriB9\n(\u223c 0.4 km s\u22121 ). We also note that due to a lack of continuum data, Harju et al. derive OriB9 abundance based\non the known Ammonia abundance in the region (not to-\n\n\fH2 D+ in a high mass star-forming region\nwards the core), and might be offset from its true value.\nThe H2 D+ column density in OrionB9 itself is comparable to Cygnus-X. The difference in line width is also\nreconciled if we account for the different spatial scales\nprobed. Using the line width-size relation with an exponent of 0.4, if we were to scale the line width at a physical\nresolution of 0.03 pc i.e. 17 \u2032\u2032 FWHM APEX beam at\n410 pc to that at 0.16 pc (13 \u2032\u2032 FWHM JCMT beam at\n1700 pc), the expected line width is even higher than the\nobserved line width. Therefore the physical conditions\nin Cygnus-X might be similar to those in the quiescent\nand massive core in Orion.\nAs noted before, the average ortho-H2 D+ abundance\nin Cygnus-X is a factor of 1\u2013 20 lower than that in lowmass cores (Caselli et al. 2008). Assuming that the true\nabundance is similar to what is measured in low-mass\nstar forming regions, this might be due to a low filling\nfactor. In that case H2 D+ emission would be widespread\nbut concentrated in small regions, with a filling factor\nof \u223c 0.1. H2 D+ has been mapped in two low-mass star\nforming regions, Oph B2, a dense core in the low-mass\ncluster forming region in Ophiucus (Friesen et al. 2010),\nand L1544, a prestellar core in Taurus (Vastel et al.\n2006). The peak H2 D+ abundance in L1544 is an order of magnitude higher than for Cygnus-X. Vastel et\nal. have used a spherically symmetric chemical model\nincorporating the physical structure of the cloud (density, temperature), and fit the abundance variation of\nH2 D+ as a function of distance from the core center.\nWhile the best fit to their H2 D+ finds a peak at 10\u221210 ,\n\u03c7o\u2212H2 D+ drops to \u223c 10\u221211 at \u223c 10000 AU from the center, still smaller than our typical \u223c 17000 AU radii. This\nre-affirms our earlier conclusion that these observations\nhave uncovered extended cold dense gas that were undetected with typical molecular line and dust continuum\nsurveys. Motte et al. (2007) surveyed the entire complex\nwith MAMBO with the goal of identifying high mass\ncores at the earliest stage of evolution, but did not find\nhigh-mass analogs of prestellar dense cores. In the region\nof overlap with our H2 D+ map, a single object (CygXN53) has been identified as a massive dense core, which\nis distinctly offset from the H2 D+ cores. However, the\nthree massive dense, colder (and younger) cores discovered by this work (P1, P2, P3) are also undetected in line\nobservations (H13 CO+ and HCN 1\u20130) of Csengeri et al.\n2011.\nNow, L1544 is a prestellar core with just enough mass\n(8 M\u2299 , Tafalla et al. 1998) to form a single low-mass star.\nOph B2 on the other hand is a low-mass cluster forming\ncore. Many of the H2 D+ line properties in Cygnus-X are\nmirrored in Oph B2. Namely, the H2 D+ peak is offset\nfrom the dust as well as N2 D+ peaks. The line widths are\nhigher than in L1544, although still transonic. The emission is also distributed over a larger region. H2 D+ core\nsizes are not constrained by these observations, however\nthe whole emission extends to \u223c 14000 AU. Naively, the\nmore extreme H2 D+ properties in a high mass region like\nCygnus-X seems to be scaled up from low-mass clusters.\n\n7\n6. SUMMARY\n\nWe present the first map of ortho-H2 D+ Jk+ ,k\u2212 = 11,0\n\u2192 11,1 transition in a high mass star forming region.\nDistributed over a physical scale of 1 pc in at least five\nclumpy structures, this is also the largest H2 D+ map of\nany star forming region. The detection is weak and shows\nan anti-correlation with star-formation, wherein H2 D+\nclearly avoids the active star forming clusters, however is\nstill in their vicinity and has no IR emission of its own.\nThe H2 D+ emission is widely associated with dense dust\nemission as well as N2 D+ as observed with SMA at high\nangular resolution. However, surprisingly the dust and\nN2 D+ peaks are distinctly offset from the H2 D+ peaks.\nWhile the derived H2 D+ abundance is up to an order of\nmagnitude lower than in low-mass star forming regions,\nthe N2 D+ and N2 H+ column density and abundance is\ncomparable to or even higher than low-mass star forming\nregions. The lack of local dust counterparts remains to\nbe better understood. Our best reasoning is that H2 D+\ncores might have significantly clumpy sub-structure with\ntemperature minima at the observed H2 D+ peaks that\nneed not be density peaks. We have thus shown that\nH2 D+ is as good and unique a tool in tracing the cold\nand dense gas in low-mass star forming regions as in such\ncomplex massive star forming regions. We have discovered a large reservoir of cold and dense gas undetected\nby previous surveys that were targeted at identifying the\nearliest stages of high-mass star formation. This suggests\nthat submm continuum studies alone which are aimed at\ndetecting massive prestellar cores might fail to identify a\nlarge population of such cores in earliest stages. Sensitive H2 D+ mapping of the entire DR21 filament is likely\nto discover more of such cold quiescent gas reservoirs in\nan otherwise active high mass star-forming region.\nWe are grateful to Dr.Iain Coulson, and the JCMT\nstaff for their kind support with observations, and data\nhandling.
