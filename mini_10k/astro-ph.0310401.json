K. Inoue & H. Kamaya\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nAs long as there is dust between radiation sources and observers, the dust extinction and\nreddening1 must be corrected if we want to realize the nature of the sources. We should\nexamine how much extinction and reddening there are. The extinction property in the Galaxy\nis a well studied example (e.g., Draine & Lee 1984). Using HI and far-infrared emission as\ntracers for the dust column density, we can obtain the extinction amount by the Galactic\ndust with reasonable accuracy (Burstein & Heiles 1982; Schlegel, Finkbeiner, & Davis 1998).\nAlthough the dust distribution and properties in the external galaxies are not well known\nyet, we can correct the dust extinction in the galaxies by using some indicators of the\nextinction with some assumptions (e.g., Buat et al. 2002). How about the extinction by the\nintergalactic (IG) dust?\nWe have already known the fact that some metal elements exist in the Lyman \u03b1 clouds\neven at redshift larger than 3 (e.g., Cowie et al. 1995; Telfer et al. 2002). It suggests that\nthe dust grains also exist in the low-density intergalactic medium (IGM). Such diffuse\nIG dust causes the IG extinction and reddening, which may affect on our understanding\nof the Universe significantly. One might think that the IG dust amount is negligible because such a significant IG reddening is not reported in the previous studies (Takase 1972;\nCheng, Gaskell, & Koratkar 1991; Riess et al. 1998; Perlmutter et al. 1999). However, the\nwavelength dependence of the IG extinction is quite uncertain. If it is gray as suggested by\nAguirre (1999), a large extinction is possible with no reddening. Nobody can conclude that\nthe IG dust is negligible because of no observable reddening.\nTheoretically, it is predicted that metals synthesized in supernova (SN) explosions form\ninto the dust grains in the cooling ejecta of SNe (Kozasa & Hasegawa 1987; Todini & Ferrara\n2001; Nozawa et al. 2003; Schneider, Ferrara, & Salvaterra 2003). Recently, thermal emissions of such dust from two supernova remnants, Cas A and Kepler, are detected (Dunne et al.\n2003; Morgan et al. 2003). In a very high-z universe, SNe of massive Population III stars\nformed in low mass halos, which are likely to be the main site of the first star formation,\ncan disperse the produced metals into the IGM (Bromm, Yoshida, & Hernquist 2003). The\n\n\u22c6\n\nE-mail:akinoue@scphys.kyoto-u.ac.jp\n\u2020 JSPS Research Fellow\n1 In this paper, we call the total absolute amount of the absorption and scattering at a wavelength just extinction, and the\ndifferential extinction between two wavelengths reddening.\n\n\fAmount of Intergalactic Dust\n\n3\n\ndust grains may be also dispersed into the IGM. Therefore, the IG dust grains may exist\neven in a z & 10 universe (Elfgren & D\u00e9sert 2003).\nExtinction by the IG dust may affect on the determination of the cosmological parameters from observations of SNe. The observed dimming beyond the geometrical dimming in\nthe empty space of distant (z \u2243 0.5) Type Ia SNe, which is attributed to the cosmological\nconstant (Riess et al. 1998; Perlmutter et al. 1999), can be reproduced by the gray IG extinction without the cosmological constant (Aguirre 1999). Goobar, Bergst\u00f6m, & M\u00f6rtsell\n(2002) show that the apparent brightening of the farthest SNe Ia (z = 1.7; Riess et al. 2001)\ncan be also explained by the gray IG extinction with zero cosmological constant if the dustto-gas ratio in the IGM decreases properly with increasing redshift. Therefore, to know the\namount of the IG dust is also important in the cosmological context.\nThe evidence of the IG dust should be imprinted in the cosmic microwave background\n(CMB) and infrared background because the dust emits thermal radiation in the waveband from the far-infrared to submillimetre (submm) (Rowan-Robinson, Negroponte, & Silk\n1979; Wright 1981; Elfgren & D\u00e9sert 2003). Although the COBE data provides us with\nonly a rough upper bound on the IG dust (Loeb & Haiman 1997; Ferrara et al. 1999;\nAguirre & Haiman 2000), the data of WMAP (Spergel et al. 2003) may be promising. The\nsubmm background radiation will give a more strict constraint on the IG dust (Aguirre & Haiman\n2000).\nRecently, we have proposed a new constraint on the IG dust amount by using thermal\nhistory of the IGM (Inoue & Kamaya 2003). Since the dust photoelectric heating is very\nefficient in the IGM (Nath, Sethi, & Shchekinov 1999), the theoretical thermal evolution of\nthe IGM taking into account of the heating by dust violates the observational temperature\nevolution if too much IG dust is input in the model. Hence, Inoue & Kamaya (2003) obtain\nan upper bound of the IG dust amount in order that the theoretical IGM temperature should\nbe consistent with the observed one. The obtained upper bound of the dust-to-gas ratio in\nthe IGM is 1% and 0.1% of the Galactic one depending on the IG grain size of \u223c 100 \u00c5\u2013\n0.1 \u03bcm and \u223c 10 \u00c5, respectively, at redshift of \u223c 3.\nIn this paper, with help of distant SNe Ia observation, we extend our previous approach\nin order to discuss the upper bounds of the IG dust extinction and reddening. In the next\nsection, we start from the cosmic star formation history (SFH) to specify the IG dust amount\nat each redshift. According to the assumed SFH, we can estimate IG dust extinction and reddening at each redshift theoretically. In section 3, we comment on observational constraints\n\n\f4\n\nA. K. Inoue & H. Kamaya\n\nfrom the extinction and reddening of distant SNe Ia. In section 4, further constraints are\npresented by comparing theoretical and observational thermal histories of the IGM. Based\non the allowed amount of the IG dust, we also discuss some implications from our results in\nsection 5. The achieved conclusions are summarised in the final section.\nThroughout the paper, we stand on a \u039b-cosmology. That is, we constrain the amount of\nthe IG dust in order that the IG dust should not affect on the determination of the cosmological parameters from distant SNe Ia. This is because the flat universe is favored by results\nof CMB observations (Jaffe et al. 2001; Pryke et al. 2002; Spergel et al. 2003), whereas only\nthe matter cannot make the flat universe (Percival et al. 2001). Furthermore, the recent\nobservations of the X-ray scattering halo around high-z QSOs suggest too small amount\nof the IG dust to explain all amount of the dimming of the distant SNe Ia (Paerels et al.\n2002; Telis et al. 2002, but see also Windt 2002). M\u00f6rtsell & Goobar (2003) also reach the\nsame conclusion by analyzing the observed colours of the SDSS (Sloan Digital Sky Survey) quasars. The following cosmological parameters are adopted: H0 = 70 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 ,\n\u03a9M = 0.3, \u03a9\u039b = 0.7, and \u03a9b = 0.04.\n\n2\n\nSTAR FORMATION HISTORY AND INTERGALACTIC DUST\n\nTo estimate the IG extinction and reddening theoretically, we must investigate production\nof dust at each redshift. Since dust is made of metals, a cosmological evolution of the metal\namount should be specified. As metals are products of stellar evolution, therefore, we shall\nspecify the cosmic SFH as a first step.\nSince Madau et al. (1996), researches of the cosmic SFH are extensively performed. In\nfigure 1, we show observational star formation rates in a unit comoving density as a function\nof redshift. The cross and open symbols are estimated from the H\u03b1 line and the rest-frame\nultra-violet (UV) luminosities not corrected by the interstellar dust extinction. Hence these\nare lower limits. The filled-circles are estimated from the submm data. Due to the small\nstatistics, the uncertainty of the submm data is rather large. The real SFH is still uncertain\nbecause we do not know the suitable correction factor against the internal dust extinction.\nIn this paper, therefore, we adopt two example models: high and low SFHs, which are shown\nin figure 1 as solid and dashed curves, respectively. For the low SFH case, we have employed\na conservative correction factor for the internal dust extinction. The high SFH case is set to\nbe compatible with the submm data.

Recently, some authors\nsuggest that a SFH like the high case is more likely (e.g., Springel & Hernquist 2003;\nGiavalisco et al. 2004). Hence, we discuss the high SFH case mainly in the following.\nOnce a SFH is specified and if the instantaneous recycling approximation is adopted, the\ncosmic mean metallicity2 evolution is determined by:\nyZ\nZ(z) =\n\u03a9b \u03c1c,0\n\nZ\n\nz\n\nzS\n\n\u03c1\u2217SFR (z \u2032 )\n\ndz \u2032\n,\nH(z \u2032 )(1 + z \u2032 )\n\n(2)\n\nwhere yZ is the produced metal mass fraction for a unit star forming mass, \u03c1c,0 is the\ncurrent critical density, zS is the starting redshift of the cosmic star formation, and H(z) is\nthe Hubble constant at the redshift z. We have assumed yZ to be a constant for simplicity.\nIf the Salpeter initial mass function (0.1\u2013125 M\u2299 ) is assumed, yZ = 0.024 (Madau et al.\n1996). We assume zS = 10 in this paper. This does not affect on the results obtained in\nthe following sections because the measure of time along the redshift is small in the high-z\n2\n\nIn this paper, we define metallicity as the mass fraction of elements heavier than Li as the usual way.\n\n\f6\n\nA.

(2004) find [Si/C]\u223c 0.8.\n\nuniverse. Indeed, the cosmic metallicities in z . 3 for various zS become nearly equal to\neach other if zS & 5.\nIn figure 2, we show the mean cosmic metallicity as a function of redshift. In the figure,\nthe lower limit of metallicity in the Ly\u03b1 clouds measured from C IV and Si IV by Songaila\n(2001) and the ranges of carbon abundance obtained by Schaye et al. (2003) and oxygen\nabundance obtained by Telfer et al. (2002) are overlaid. Our theoretical estimate of total\nmetallicity in the universe is compatible with the observed oxygen abundance in the IGM.\nThis may mean that a large part (\u223c 50%) of metal produced in galaxies exist out of galaxies.\nOn the other hand, our estimate is much larger than the observed carbon abundance. This\nmay indicate that carbon is not suitable to trace the cosmic mean metallicity in the early\nphase since the first metal pollution is made by the Type II SNe (e.g., Pagel 1997). Indeed,\nAguirre et al. (2004) find [Si/C]\u223c 0.8.\nLet us introduce one parameter to describe the amount of the IG dust; the ratio of the\nIG dust mass to the total metal mass in the universe defined as\n\u03c7\u2261\n\nD IGM\nIG dust mass\n=\n,\ntotal metal mass\nZ\n\n(3)\n\nwhere D IGM is the dust-to-gas mass ratio in the IGM. In principle, this parameter is determined by the transfer mechanism of dust grains from galaxies into the IGM. Although\nsome authors have tried to solve this problem approximately (e.g., Ferrara et al. 1990, 1991;\n\n\fAmount of Intergalactic Dust\n\n7\n\nAguirre et al. 2001), the results are not still conclusive. This is because we must solve problems of the magneto-radiation-hydrodynamics of dusty plasma finally. Here we approach the\nparameter \u03c7 by another way; we constrain the parameter by using the observational data of\ndistant SNe Ia (\u00a73) and the thermal history of the IGM (\u00a74). While the parameter \u03c7 may\nevolve along redshift, we treat it as a constant for simplicity. Hence, the obtained values of\n\u03c7 in the following sections are regarded as those averaged over redshift.\nA dust model must also be specified. In this paper, we adopt the \"graphite\" and the\n\"smoothed astronomical silicate\" models by Draine & Lee (1984); Laor & Draine (1993);\nWeingartner & Draine (2001a), which can explain the interstellar dust properties in the\nGalaxy and the Magellanic clouds very well. Although there is no evidence that the IG dust\nis the same as the Galactic dust, we assume them as a working hypothesis.\nThe grain size distribution in the IGM is also quite uncertain. As a first step, we assume\nall grains to have the same size. This means that the grain size in the current paper indicates\na characteristic size of the IG dust (i.e. an averaged size by a certain way). Aguirre (1999)\nsuggests a selection rule in the transfer of dust grains from the host galaxies into the IGM; the\nsmall grains are destroyed by the thermal sputtering process when the grains are transfered\nthrough the hot gas halo of the host galaxies. Indeed, this theoretical suggestion is very\ninteresting to realize the gray dust model. However, we also examine the possibility of the\nsmall IG grain because the suggestion of the selection rule is not confirmed observationally\nat the moment.\n\n3\n\nCONSTRAINT FROM OBSERVATIONAL DIMMING OF\nSUPERNOVAE\n\nIn this section, we constrain the amount of the IG dust by means of observational dimming\nof distant Type Ia SNe. According to Riess et al. (2001), the dimming of SNe Ia at z \u223c 0.5\nis \u223c 0.2 \u00b1 0.1 mag against the empty universe. Our policy is that the IG dust extinction\ndoes not affect the interpretation of the cosmological constant. Thus, we attribute the 0.2\nmag dimming of SNe Ia at z \u223c 0.5 to the cosmological constant and regard the quoted error\n(0.1 mag) as an upper limit of the contribution by the IG dust to the dimming. Although\nthe cosmological dimming does not depend on the observed wavelength, the dimming by\nthe IG dust may depend on the wavelength. As the distant SNe Ia are observed in B and\nV -bands and B-band provides a slightly more strict constraint of the IG dust than V -band,\n\n\f8\n\nA. K. Inoue & H. Kamaya\n\nwe regard the upper limit of 0.1 mag as that in the B-band. In addition, Perlmutter et al.\n(1999) report that the difference of the observed reddening between the local and distant\nSNe is hE(B \u2212 V )iz=0.5 \u2212 hE(B \u2212 V )iz=0.05 = 0.002 \u00b1 0.03 mag. Although there seems to be\nno systematic difference, we can still consider the absolute value of the colour excess by the\nIG dust less than 0.03 mag. In summary, the IG extinction and reddening from observations\nIGM\nof distant SNe Ia at z \u223c 0.5 are AIGM\nB,z=0.5 6 0.1 mag and |E(B \u2212 V )z=0.5 | 6 0.03 mag.\n\nSuppose an observer who observes a source with a redshift of z at a wavelength of \u03bbobs\nin his/her rest frame. The amount of the IG extinction is given by\nZ z\nAIGM\n\u03bbobs\nc dz \u2032\n\u03bbobs (z)\nIGM \u2032\n2\nQ a,\n(z\nn\n)\n= 1.086\u03c0a\n,\nd\nmag\n1 + z\u2032\n(1 + z \u2032 )H(z \u2032 )\n0\n!\n\n(4)\n\nwhere a is the grain radius, Q is the extinction efficiency factor, c is the light speed, and\nis the IG grain number density in a unit physical volume, which is\nnIGM\nd\nnIGM\n(z)\nd\n\n\u03c7\u03a9b \u03c1c,0 (1 + z)3 Z(z)\n,\n=\n4\u03c0a3 \u033a/3\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u033a(= 2 g cm\u22123 ) is the grain material density. For simplicity, we have assumed that dust\ngrains distribute uniformly with nIGM\ncorresponding to the redshift. We do not consider any\nd\nstructure of the dust distribution.\nIn figure 3, we show the amount of the IG extinction divided by \u03c7 for a source with\nz = 0.5 as a function of the assumed grain size. While the results for the high SFH is\ndepicted in the figure, the extinction amount for the low SFH case is only a factor of about\n1.5 smaller than that of the high SFH case. The extinction amount is independent of the\ngrain size as long as 2\u03c0a < \u03bb. This is caused by (1) the extinction cross section (= Qext \u03c0a2 )\nis proportional to a3 because the extinction efficiency factor, Qext , is proportional to the\ngrain size, a, linearly, and (2) the number density of the grain has a dependence of a\u22123 for\na fixed dust mass. On the other hand, Qext becomes constant (almost 2) when 2\u03c0a > \u03bb,\nso that the extinction cross section is determined by mainly the geometrical one which is\nproportional to a2 . Thus, the extinction amount is proportional to a\u22121 . When 2\u03c0a \u223c \u03bb,\ngrains interact with photons the most effectively, so that the amount of extinction shows a\npeak in both panels of figure 3.\nWe shall remember the observational constraints of AIGM\nB,z=0.5 6 0.1 mag and |E(B \u2212\nV )IGM\nz=0.5 | 6 0.03 mag. Hence, we can obtain the upper bound of \u03c7 via Eq.(4) or figure 3,\nwhich is shown in figure 4. The silicate and graphite cases are shown in the panel (a) and\n(b), respectively. The dotted and dashed curves indicate the upper bounds of \u03c7 based on\n\n\fAmount of Intergalactic Dust\n\n9\n\n(a) z=0.5\nsilicate\n1\nAIGM/\u03c7 [mag]\n\nAIGM/\u03c7 [mag]\n\n1\n\n0.1\n\n0.01\n\n0.01\n0.001\n\n0.1\n\n0.01\n0.1\ngrain size [\u03bcm]\n\n1\n\nz=0.5\n(b) graphite\n\n0.001\n\n0.01\n0.1\ngrain size [\u03bcm]\n\nFigure 3.

The discontinuity of the\n\ndashed curve is due to E(B \u2212 V ) = 0; the left of the discontinuity is positive E(B \u2212 V ) and\nthe right is negative one. The solid curve is the upper bound based on the thermal history\nof the IGM which is obtained in the next section. The rejected area of \u03c7 is shaded; the\nthin shade means the rejected area based on the SNe Ia extinction/reddening, and the thick\nshade is the area based on the IGM thermal history (section 4). We show only the high SFH\ncase.\nWe find that, for both grain types, the upper bound of \u03c7 from the distant SNe Ia is\n\u223c 0.1(a/0.1 \u03bcm) for 0.1 \u03bcm . a . 1 \u03bcm. While we have no constraint of \u03c7 for the small\n(a . 100 \u00c5) silicate grain (panel [a]), the upper bound of \u03c7 is \u223c 0.1 when a . 100 \u00c5 for the\ngraphite case (panel [b]). This difference is caused by the different optical properties between\ngraphite and silicate; small silicate is more transparent than graphite in the optical bands.\nFor 100 \u00c5 . a . 0.1 \u03bcm, the upper bound of \u03c7 shows a local minimum corresponding to the\npeak shown in figure 3. Finally, there is not any constraint of \u03c7 for a very large (a & 1 \u03bcm)\ngrain.\n\n1\n\n\f10\n\nA. K. Inoue & H.

The high SFH is assumed.\n\n4\n\nCONSTRAINT FROM IGM THERMAL HISTORY\n\nAs shown in the previous paper (Inoue & Kamaya 2003), we show that the amount of the\nIG dust is constrained by using the thermal history of the IGM. When a dust grain is\nhit by a photon with an energy larger than a critical value, an electron escapes from the\ngrain; photoelectric effect. Such a photoelectron contributes to the gas heating if its energy\nis larger than the mean kinetic energy of gas particles. As shown in Appendix A (see also\nNath, Sethi, & Shchekinov 1999; Inoue & Kamaya 2003), the photoelectric heating by dust\ngrains is comparable with, and sometimes dominate, the atomic photoionization heating\nin the IGM. Of course, the efficiency of the dust heating depends on the dust amount. If\na model of the IGM has too much dust, the theoretical temperature of IGM exceeds the\nobservational one owing to the dust photoelectric heating. Therefore, we can put an upper\nbound of the amount of the IG dust so as to keep the consistency between the theoretical\nIGM temperature and the observed one. In the next subsection, we describe how to calculate\nthe thermal history of IGM affected by the dust photoelectric heating. An upper bound of\n\u03c7, which represents the amount of the IG dust, is estimated in subsection 4.2.\n\n\fAmount of Intergalactic Dust\n4.1\n\n11\n\nThermal history of IGM\n\nIn this paper, we consider only a mean temperature of the IGM, TIGM , for simplicity. The\nTIGM time-evolution is described by (e.g., Hui & Gnedin 1997)\nTIGM dX 2(\u0393 \u2212 \u039b)\ndTIGM\n= \u22122HTIGM \u2212\n+\n,\ndt\nX dt\n3kB Xnb\n\n(6)\n\nwhere H is the Hubble constant, nb is the cosmic mean number density of baryon, \u0393 and \u039b\nare the total heating and cooling rates per unit volume, respectively, X is the number ratio of\nthe total gaseous particles to the baryon particles, i.e., X \u2261\n\nP\n\nni /nb , where ni is the number\n\ndensity of the i-th gaseous species and we consider H i, H ii, He i, He ii, He iii, and electron.\nWe neglect the effect of helium and metal production by stars on the chemical abundance\nfor simplicity. Fortunately, time evolution of their abundance is not important. Indeed, the\nmetal mass fraction reaches at the most 0.002 (figure 2). The number ratio of helium to\nhydrogen is always about 0.1 after the Big-bang. A constant mass fraction (Y = 0.24) of\nhelium is assumed throughout our calculation.\nWe solve equation (6) coupled with non-equilibrium rate equations for these gaseous\nspecies by the fourth-order Runge-Kutta scheme. These rate equations with rate coefficients\nand the heating/cooling rates are summarised in Appendix B. In the calculation, the timestep is adjusted to being 1/1000 of \u2212XHI /(dXHI /dt) for dXHI /dt < 0 and XHII /(dXHI /dt)\nfor dXHI /dt > 0 (see equation [B6] for dXHI /dt). The number density of the IG dust\nat each redshift is determined by equation (1), (2), and (5) depending on \u03c7. The grain\ncharge and heating/cooling rates are determined by a standard manner which is described\nin Inoue & Kamaya (2003) (see also Appendix A).\nThe initial condition is as follows: the starting redshift is z = 3.4, at which it is considered\nthat the HeII reionization occurred (e.g., Theuns et al. 2002a). The initial temperature is\nset to be 25,000 K, which is the mean IGM temperature at this redshift suggested by\nthe Lyman \u03b1 forest in QSO spectra (Schaye et al. 2000; Theuns et al. 2002b). We assume\nan ionization equilibrium balanced between the recombination and the photoionization as\nthe initial chemical abundance. In each time step, the calculated chemical abundance at\nz < 3.4 reaches almost another ionization equilibrium balanced among the recombination,\nthe photoionization, and the collisional ionization.3\n3\n\nFor a technical reason, we did not include the collisional ionization in the calculation of the initial condition; to avoid being\n\ndXHI /dt = 0 for the time-step. Since the collisional ionization plays only a minor role, the calculated chemical abundance is\ndifferent slightly from the abundance in the recombination\u2013photoionization equilibrium.\n\n\f12\n\n-21\n-21.5\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n-1\n\nlog JL [erg s cm sr Hz ]\n\nA.

(2002).\nThe solid line is an analytical fit described in equation (7).\n\nThe background radiation is required to calculate the IGM thermal history. We assume\na single power-law background radiation; its mean intensity at a frequency of \u03bd is J\u03bd =\nJL (\u03bd/\u03bdL )\u2212\u03b1 , where JL and \u03bdL are the mean intensity and the frequency at the hydrogen\nLyman limit. We also assume the spectral index \u03b1 to be constant, but the intensity JL\nevolves along the redshift. In figure 5, such an evolution is displayed. The data are taken\nfrom Scott et al. (2002) who investigate the QSO proximity effect on the number density of\nthe Lyman \u03b1 forest in spectra of QSOs at z = 0\u20135, and estimate the Lyman limit intensity\nof the background radiation in the redshift range. Here, we use a fitting formula as\nJL\n\u2248 2.5 \u00d7 10\u221223 (1 + z)2.5\n\u22121\n\u22122\n\u22121\n\u22121\nerg s cm sr Hz\n\n(7)\n\nfor 0 . z . 4, which is shown in figure 5 as the solid line. The background radiation at z . 3\nis likely to be dominated by QSOs. Hence, we consider two cases of \u03b1 = 1 and 2. Such values\nof \u03b1 are consistent with the QSO dominated background radiation (Haardt & Madau 1996;\nZheng et al. 1997). In appendix A2, we show that the results with \u03b1 = 1 single power-law\nbackground spectrum should be consistent quantitatively with those with a more realistic\nspectrum like Haardt & Madau (1996).\nIn figure 6, we show some examples of the IGM thermal history, assuming 0.1 \u03bcm IG\ndust and the spectral index of \u03b1 = 1. The panel (a) shows the silicate and the high SFH\ncase, and the panel (b) shows the graphite and the low SFH case. In each panel, six cases of\n\u03c7 are depicted as the solid curves.

They observe the Ly\u03b1 clouds with the column density of\n1013\u221215 cm\u22122 (i.e., slightly over density regions), and convert the temperature of the clouds\ninto that at the mean density of the IGM by using the equation of state of the IGM. Thus,\nwe can compare both thermal histories directly. In the next subsection, such a comparison\nis presented quantitatively.\n\n4.2\n\nConstraint for \u03c7 from thermal history of IGM\n\nOnce theoretical histories of IGM temperature are obtained, the amount of IG dust is constrained from the comparison of the theoretical temperature with observational one. Hence,\nwe compare our theoretical thermal histories with 10 observational points at the range of\n1.5 < z < 3.4 of Schaye et al. (2000). We reject a case of too much \u03c7 by the least squares\nmethod. The rejection criterion is the significance level less than 30% in \u03c72 -test.

We find a rough upper bound of \u03c7 as 0.1 with a factor of a few uncertainty, except\nfor a very large (\u223c 1 \u03bcm) case and a medium-size (\u223c 100 \u00c5) silicate of \u03b1 = 2.\nThe upper bound of \u03c7 from the thermal history has a positive dependence of grain size.\nThis corresponds to the fact that the dust heating rate has a negative dependence of grain\nsize (see figure A3). Especially, for small silicate grain, we obtain a strict upper bound of\n\u03c7 from the thermal history, whereas observations of distant SNe Ia cannot provide any\nconstraints.\nWe notice here that the upper bound of \u03c7 for small silicate is smaller than that for\nsmall graphite. This is why a small (a . 0.1\u03bcm) silicate has a larger efficiency factor for\nabsorption than that of graphite in the UV\u2013X-ray regime. Hence the grain potential, mean\nphotoelectron energy, and heating rate of small silicate are larger than those of graphite\n(figures A1\u2013A3). Moreover, we find a positive dependence of the spectral index \u03b1 against\nthe obtained upper bounds of \u03c7, which is due to the negative dependence of \u03b1 against the\ndust heating rate (figure A3).\n\n\fAmount of Intergalactic Dust\n-32\n\n15\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n10\ndust-to-gas mass ratio\n\nIG dust density [g cm-3 ]\n\nhigh SFH\n\n-33\n\n10\n\n-34\n\n10\n\n\u03c7=0.1\n\nhigh SFH\n\n1\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n-5\n\n10\n\n\u03c7=0.1\n\nlow SFH\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n-35\n\n10\n\nlow SFH\n\n-6\n\n2\n\n4\n\n7\n\n1+z\n\n10\n\n10\n\n1\n\n2\n\n4\n\n7\n\n10\n\n1+z\n\nFigure 7.

The assumed \u03c7, the mass ratio\nof the IG dust to the total metal in the universe, is 0.1.\n\n5\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nWe have obtained upper bound of \u03c7 as a function of grain size from observations of distant\nSNe Ia and comparison of theoretical IGM thermal history with observational one. Here we\ndiscuss what our results imply.\n5.1\n\nAllowable amount of IG dust\n\nHow much dust can exist in the IGM? Once assuming a value of \u03c7, we obtain the IG dust\ndensity via equation (5). In figure 7, we show the upper bounds of the IG dust mass density\nand D IGM as a function of redshift. The solid and dashed curves are the cases of high and\nlow SFHs, respectively. The assumed upper bound of \u03c7 is 0.1 for both cases of SFHs. The\nuncertainty of this value of \u03c7 is about a factor of a few as long as the IG grain size is\nsmaller than 1 \u03bcm and the background spectral index \u03b1 = 1 (see also Table 1). We find\nthat the upper bound of the local (z \u223c 0) universe is determined well; the local IG dust\ndensity is less than about 10\u221234 g cm\u22123 , or equivalently the dust-to-gas ratio is less than\nabout 3 \u00d7 10\u22124 which is about 1/20 of the Galactic value. Along the redshift, the allowed\ndust density increases and the dust-to-gas ratio decreases. The increasing/decreasing rates\nchange at z \u223c 1 at which the (1+z) dependence of the assumed SFH changes (eq.[1]). Taking\ninto account a factor of 2 uncertainty of the upper bound of \u03c7, we obtain the maximum IG\ndust density as\n\n\f16\n\nA. K. Inoue & H.

Four\ncases of grain size as 10 \u00c5, 100 \u00c5, 0.1 \u03bcm, and 1 \u03bcm are indicated by dotted, dot-dashed,\nsolid, and dashed curves, respectively. The constraints from SNe Ia observations of AB 6 0.1\nmag and |E(B \u2212 V )| 6 0.03 mag at z = 0.5 are also shown as the downward arrow in each\npanel. We note that the vertical axes of panels (c) and (d) are the absolute value of colour\nexcess. Indeed, colour excesses of 1 \u03bcm for silicate, and of 0.1 \u03bcm and 1 \u03bcm for graphite are\nnegative.\nWe find that the upper bound of the IG extinction is \u223c 0.2 mag for a source at z = 1\nfrom panels (a) and (b) of figure 8. This value agrees well with the result from SDSS quasars\ndata by M\u00f6rtsell & Goobar (2003). For z & 1 objects, the upper bound of the IG extinction\nbecomes \u223c 0.5 mag, and as an extreme case, we cannot reject the possibility of 1 mag IG\nextinction for a source at z \u223c 3.\nInterestingly, we can investigate the nature of the IG dust by using the IG reddening.\nFor z & 1 sources, the expected absolute value of colour excess by the IG grain larger than\n\u223c 0.1 \u03bcm is very small, at the most \u223c 0.05 mag, whereas that by a smaller grain can\nreach 0.1 mag or more. Thus, it may be possible to determine a typical size of the IG grain\nfrom observations of colour excess against a source at z & 1; the detection of & 0.1 mag\ncolour excess for such a source proves the existence of small (. 100 \u00c5) IG grains. If the IG\ndust is dominated by such small grains, the composition of the IG dust can be found. The\nsmall graphite grains show a prominent absorption feature at 2175 \u00c5. Thus, we expect a\nlocal minimum of colour excess for a source at z \u2243 2.5 as shown in panel (d) of figure 8.\n\n\f17\n\nAmount of Intergalactic Dust\n1\n\n1\n(b)\n\n(a) silicate\n\n0.1\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5 2 2.5 3\nsource redshift\n\nSNe\n\nAB [mag]\n\nAB [mag]\n\n1 \u03bcm\n0.1 \u03bcm\n100 A\n10 A\n\n0.01\n\n0.001\n\n0.1\n\nSNe\n\ngraphite\n1 \u03bcm\n0.1 \u03bcm\n100 A\n10 A\n\n0.01\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\n0.001\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1.5 2 2.5 3\nsource redshift\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\n(d) graphite\n\n|E(B-V)| [mag]\n\n|E(B-V)| [mag]\n\n1\n\n1\n(c) silicate\n\n0.1\nSNe\n0.01\n\n0.001\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5 2 2.5 3\nsource redshift\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\n0.1\nSNe\n0.01\n\n0.001\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5 2 2.5 3\nsource redshift\n\nFigure 8.

Assumed \u03c7 values are summarised in Table 1. For dotted,\ndot-dashed, solid, and dashed curves, we assumed the grain size of 10 \u00c5, 100 \u00c5, 0.1 \u03bcm, and 1 \u03bcm, respectively. The spectral\nindex of the background radiation is assumed to be unity. The upper bounds from observations of distant SNe Ia are shown\nas the downward arrow in each panel. The vertical axes of panels (c) and (d) are the absolute value of the colour excesses.\nActually, colour excesses of 1 \u03bcm for silicate and of 0.1 and 1 \u03bcm for graphite are negative.\n\nTherefore, if we detect such a change of colour excess along the redshift, we can conclude\nthat many small graphite grains exist in the IGM.\nObservations to detect the IG extinction and reddening are very challenging but strongly\nencouraging. High-z gamma-ray bursts can be good background light sources for such observations (Perna & Aguirre 2000).\n\n\f18\n\nA. K. Inoue & H. Kamaya\n\n5.3\n\nEjection efficiency of dust from galaxies\n\nThe dust-to-metal mass ratio in the Galaxy, \u03b4MW , is 0.3\u20130.5 (e.g., Spitzer 1978; Whittet\n2003). We may consider the dust-to-metal ratio in the IGM, \u03b4IGM is equal to \u03b4MW , if \u03b4MW is\ntypical for all galaxies, and metal and dust are ejected together from galaxies to the IGM\nkeeping \u03b4MW . Is this compatible with the obtained upper bound of \u03c7 . 0.1?\nA fraction of metal produced by stars in galaxies exists out of galaxies. This metal escape\nfraction is defined as fZ,esc . While fZ,esc is still uncertain, an estimate of it is 50\u201375% (Aguirre\n1999, and references therein, see also our figure 2). We shall define another parameter of the\nIGM metallicity; ZIGM . Because of \u03c7 = D IGM /Z and fZ,esc = ZIGM /Z, where Z is the total\ncosmic metallicity, we find \u03b4IGM = D IGM /ZIGM = \u03c7/fZ,esc . Unless fZ,esc is less than \u223c 0.5,\n\u03b4IGM is estimated to be smaller than 0.2 if \u03c7 . 0.1. Therefore, our result of \u03c7 . 0.1 with\nfZ,esc \u223c 0.5 may indicate that \u03b4IGM < \u03b4MW .\nIf that is true, we have to consider some mechanisms to reduce \u03b4IGM during the dust\ntransfer. For example, dust destruction during the transfer from galaxies to the IGM (Aguirre\n1999), and/or different ejection efficiencies between metal and dust. Time evolution of the\ndust-to-metal ratio in galaxies may be also important. As shown by Inoue (2003), the dustto-metal ratio in younger galaxies (i.e., higher-z galaxies) may be much smaller (\u223c 70% off)\nthan the present value of the Galaxy. In the case, a time-averaged \u03b4MW can become smaller\nthan the current \u03b4MW adopted above, so that our constraint of \u03c7 may be cleared. In any\ncase, we cannot obtain a rigid quantitative conclusion at the moment, because uncertainties\nare still large. Further studies of this issue are very interesting.\n\n5.4\n\nIGM temperature at low redshift\n\nAs shown in Nath et al. (1999) and Appendix A, the dust photoelectric heating becomes\nmore efficient for a lower gas density. Although the background intensity decreases along\nthe redshift (figure 5), the decrement of gas density is more efficient than the decrement\nof the background intensity, so that the importance of the dust heating increases for a\nlower redshift. While we obtained constraints of the amount of the IG dust from the IGM\ntemperature at z \u2243 2\u20133 in section 4, the IGM temperature at a lower redshift of z .\n1 provides us with a further constraint of the IG dust. Therefore, to measure the IGM\ntemperature at z . 1 is very interesting.\nHere, we demonstrate how much temperature is allowed by our upper bounds of \u03c7.

The dotted, dot-dashed, and solid curves are the case of no IG dust, 100 \u00c5, and 0.1 \u03bcm,\nrespectively. The data points are taken from Schaye et al. (2000).\n\n9 shows the IGM thermal histories assumed the upper bounds of \u03c7 in Table 1 for the case of\nbackground spectral index \u03b1 = 1 and high SFH. The dotted, dot-dashed, and solid curves\nare the case of no IG dust, 100 \u00c5 silicate, and 0.1 \u03bcm silicate, respectively. We can make a\nvery similar figure for graphite case. The temperatures shown in the figure are upper bounds,\nwhich is denoted as TIGM,up .\nAfter checking all cases listed in table 1, we find that for a smaller (. 100 \u00c5) grain case,\nexcept for graphite of \u03b1 = 2, TIGM,up at z . 1 is still much higher than 10,000 K. On the\nother hand, for a larger (& 0.1 \u03bcm) case, except for 1 \u03bcm graphite with high SFH and \u03b1 = 1,\nTIGM,up at z . 1 becomes lower than 10,000 K as well as no IG dust case. Therefore, we may\nconclude that IG grains are small if temperature higher than 10,000 K is observed at z . 1.\nConversely, a lower IGM temperature at z . 1 provides us with a very strict constraint\nagainst small IG dust.\n\n6\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe investigate the amount of the IG dust allowed by current observations of distant SNe\nIa and temperature of the IGM. The allowed amount of the IG dust is described as the\nupper bound of \u03c7, the mass ratio of the IG dust to the total metal mass in the Universe.\nTo specify \u03c7, two models of cosmic history of metal production rate are assumed. That is,\n\n\f20\n\nA. K. Inoue & H. Kamaya\n\nwe have assumed two cosmic star formation histories expected from the recent observation\nof the high redshift objects. Our conclusions are as follows:\n(1) Combining constraints from the IGM thermal history with those from distant SNe\nIa observations, we obtain the upper bounds of \u03c7 as a function of grain size in the IGM;\nroughly \u03c7 . 0.1 for 10 \u00c5 . a . 0.1 \u03bcm, and \u03c7 . 0.1(a/0.1 \u03bcm) for 0.1 \u03bcm . a . 1 \u03bcm.\n(2) The upper bound of \u03c7 \u223c 0.1 corresponds to the upper bound of the IG dust density;\nthe density increases from \u223c 10\u221234 g cm\u22123 at z = 0 to \u223c 10\u221233 g cm\u22123 at z \u223c 1, and keeps\na constant value or slowly increases toward higher redshift.\n(3) The expected IG extinction against a source at z \u223c 1 is less than \u223c 0.2 mag at the\nobserver's B-band. For higher redshift sources, we cannot reject the possibility of 1 mag\nextinction by the IG dust at the observer's B-band.\n(4) Observations of colour excess against a source at z & 1 provides us with information\nuseful to constrain the nature of the IG dust. If we detect \u223c 0.1 mag colour excess between\nthe observer's B and V -bands, a typical size of the IG dust is . 100 \u00c5. Moreover, if there\nare many graphite grains of a . 100 \u00c5 in the IGM, we find a local minimum of the colour\nexcess of a source at z \u223c 2.5 corresponding to 2175 \u00c5 absorption feature.\n(5) If half of metal produced in galaxies exists in the IGM, the obtained upper bound of\n\u03c7 \u223c 0.1 means that the dust-to-metal ratio in the IGM is smaller than the current Galactic\nvalue. It suggests that some mechanisms to reduce the dust-to-metal ratio in the IGM\nare required. For example, dust destruction in transfer from galaxies to the IGM, selective\ntransport of metal from galaxies, and time evolution of the dust-to-metal ratio in galaxies\n(i.e., a smaller value for younger galaxies).\n(6) Although we obtain constrains of the IG dust from the IGM temperature at z \u223c 2\u20133,\nthe temperature at z . 1 provides us with a more strict constraint of the IG dust. For\nexample, the detection of temperature higher than 10,000 K at z . 1 suggests that the IG\ndust is dominated by small (. 100 \u00c5) grains.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe have appreciated a lot of advice to improve the quality of this paper by the referee, Dr. S.\nBianchi, informative comments presented by Prof. B.

The basic equations of the dust\nphotoelectric effect are presented in various places, for example, section 2 in Inoue & Kamaya\n\n\f24\n\nA. K. Inoue & H. Kamaya\n\n(2003). More detailed information on this effect can be found in Weingartner & Draine\n(2001b).\nWe consider spherical silicate and graphite grains. Under a condition suitable for the IGM\n(low density and intense UV radiation), these grains have a positive electric charge, which\nis determined mainly by the competition between the collisional electron capture and the\nphotoelectric ionization. The ion collision is negligible, while the proton collision is included\nin the calculation in section 4 and for making the following figures. The charge on grains is\nin an equilibrium state, which is achieved quickly (\u223c 10\u2013100 yr).\nThe input parameters to obtain the equilibrium charge are grain type, grain size, gas density, gas temperature, radiation intensity, and radiation spectrum. We assume the incident\nradiation spectrum to be a power-law. In figure A1, we show these dependences of the equilibrium grain potential energy normalized by the gas kinetic energy, i.e., eU/kB T = Zd e2 /akB T ,\nwhere U is the grain potential, Zd is the grain charge, a is the grain size, T is the gas temperature, e is the electron charge, and kB is the Boltzmann constant. We examine three\ncases of the power-law index of the incident radiation, \u03b1 = 1, 2, and 5, where the mean\nintensity is J\u03bd and proportional to \u03bd \u2212\u03b1 . While the spectrum of the incident radiation is\nrather uncertain, it is likely to be a power-law with index of 1\u20132 if the radiation is dominated by QSOs (e.g., Haardt & Madau 1996; Zheng et al. 1997). The case of \u03b1 = 5 is a\nreference of a very soft background radiation. The parameter set assumed in the calculation\nare noted in each panel of figure A1; a,\u22125 = a/0.1\u03bcm, n,\u22125 = n/10\u22125 cm\u22123 , T,4 = T /104 K,\nand J,\u221221 = J\u03bdL /10\u221221 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 sr\u22121 Hz\u22121 , where \u03bdL is the Lyman limit frequency. These\nvalues may be suitable for the IGM at z \u223c 3.\nThe dotted lines in figure A1 (a) and (c) indicate an upper limit of the grain potential\nbased on an estimate of the critical potential for the ion field emission (Draine & Hao 2002);\neU/kB T . 3500(T /104 K)\u22121 (a/0.1 \u03bcm). If the grain potential exceeds this upper limit, singly\ncharged ions may escape one by one from the grain surface, so that the grain is destroyed\ngradually. For panels (b) and (d), this upper limit is out of the panels. We can conclude that\nthis process is not so important for our interest.\nIn figure A2, we show a mean photoelectron energy from dust grains normalized by the\ngas kinetic energy, hEpe i/kB T , as a function of (a) grain size, (b) gas density, (c) gas temperature, and (d) radiation intensity. Moreover, the ratio of the dust photoelectric heating rate\nto the hydrogen photoionization heating rate (\u0393pe /\u0393Hpi ) is depicted as a function of these\n\n\f25\n\nAmount of Intergalactic Dust\n\nquantities in figure A3. For the dust heating rate, we assume the dust-to-gas mass ratio to\nbe 10\u22124 as a nominal value, which is about 1/100 of the Galactic dust-to-gas mass ratio.\nThe obtained results are roughly consistent with those of Nath, Sethi, & Shchekinov\n(1999). While some quantitative differences are seen between our results and theirs, they\nmay be caused by differences of the adopted photoelectric yield, absorption efficiency factors,\nand radiation spectrum.\nIn summary, we find that the dust photoelectric heating exceeds the photoionization\nheating for a case of a smaller grain size, a lower gas density, a higher temperature, a more\nintense radiation, or a harder radiation spectrum. Furthermore, we find that silicate and\ngraphite grains show similar results, and all of eU/kB T , hEpe i/kB T , and \u0393pe /\u0393Hpi show a\npower-law like dependence of grain size, gas density, gas temperature, and radiation intensity. These behaviors will be derived analytically with some approximations in the next\nsubsection.\n\nA1\n\nAnalytic investigation\n\nTo understand the behavior of grain charge and other quantities found in figures A1\u2013A3 analytically, we will adopt some further approximations in this subsection which do not appear in\nthe method described in Inoue & Kamaya (2003). However, the method by Inoue & Kamaya\n(2003) is used in the calculation for making figures A1\u2013A4 and in section 4. We would like\nto ask the reader to be careful in this point.\nLet us express eU/kB T as x. If we neglect the charging rate by grain\u2013ion collision, the\ncharge equilibrium is expressed as\nse ne hve i(1 + x) =\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nh\u03bdmax\n\nQ\u03bd Y\u03bd\n\n4\u03c0J\u03bd\nd\u03bd ,\nh\u03bd\n\n(A1)\n\nwhere se is the sticking coefficient for an electron collision, ne is the electron number density,\nhve i is the mean kinetic velocity of electron, Q\u03bd is the absorption efficiency factor of grains,\nY\u03bd is the photoelectric yield, and J\u03bd is the mean intensity of the incident radiation. The\nleft-hand side of the above equation is the electron capture rate per unit area, and the righthand side is the photoelectric ionization rate per unit area. Although the integral should\nbe summed up to infinity in general, we set the upper limit of the incident photon energy,\nh\u03bdmax = 1.24 keV. We also adopt se = 1.\nIn order to investigate analytically, we adopt a simple functional form for the photoelectric yield by Draine (1978);\n\n\fA. K. Inoue & H.

Normalized equilibrium potential of grains as a function of (a) grain size, (b) gas number density, (c) gas temperature, and (d) mean intensity at the Lyman limit. The solid and dashed curves indicate silicate and graphite cases, respectively.\nFor the incident radiation, we consider three cases of the power-law index, J\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u2212\u03b1 ; \u03b1 = 1, 2, and 5 from top to bottom\ncurves in each panel.

We note that a more realistic function of the photoelectric\nyield by Weingartner & Draine (2001b) is used in Inoue & Kamaya (2003) and in section\n4. Moreover, we adopt an approximation form of the absorption efficiency factor as Q\u03bd \u2248\nQL (\u03bd/\u03bdL )\u2212\u03b2 , where \u03bdL is the Lyman limit frequency of hydrogen.

Moreover, QL \u223c (a/0.1\u03bcm) for a . 0.1\n\u03bcm and QL \u223c 1 otherwise. Thus, eU/kB T shows nearly no dependence of grain size for a\nlarge size.\nThe mean photoelectron energy is defined as\n\n\fAmount of Intergalactic Dust\nhEpe i =\n\nR\n\nEpe Q\u03bd Y\u03bd 4\u03c0J\u03bd /h\u03bdd\u03bd\nR\n,\nQ\u03bd Y\u03bd 4\u03c0J\u03bd /h\u03bdd\u03bd\n\n29\n(A5)\n\nwhere Epe is the energy of the photoelectron. We can express Epe \u2248 \u03b7(h\u03bd \u2212 Ip ), where \u03b7 is a\nnumerical factor less than unity because a part of energy of the incident photon is converted\ninto the phonon energy of the grain (Weingartner & Draine 2001b). If we adopt a parabolic\nfunction for the energy distribution function of the photoelectron as Weingartner & Draine\n(2001b), the numerical factor \u03b7 = 1/3\u20131/2 depending on the energy of the incident photon.\nWe adopt \u03b7 = 1/2 below.\nIf we define a function as g(h\u03bd) = Epe QY J/h\u03bd and assume the functional forms adopted\nabove for Q, Y , and J, \u2202g/\u2202h\u03bd is zero only when h\u03bd = h\u03bd\u2217\u2217 = Ip (\u03b1+\u03b2+2)/(\u03b1+\u03b2). Thus, the\nintegral in the numerator of equation (A5) is an order of Epe (h\u03bd\u2217\u2217 )Q(h\u03bd\u2217\u2217 )Y (h\u03bd\u2217\u2217 )J(h\u03bd\u2217\u2217 ).\nIf x \u226b 1, we obtain\n2\nhEpe i\n\u223c\nxkB T\n\u03b1+\u03b2\n\n\u03b1+\u03b2\n\u03b1+\u03b2+1\n\n!\u03b1+\u03b2\n\n.\n\n(A6)\n\nTherefore, hEpe i/kB T has a similar parameter dependence to eU/kB T , which is observed in\nfigure A2.\nThe saturation of hEpe i/kB T is seen in the case of \u03b1 = 1 for a lower density in figure A2\n(b). This may be due to the effect of the maximum photon energy assumed in the calculation.\nWe do not consider the incident photon energy higher than 1.2 keV. For the case, Ip reaches\nseveral hundreds eV, so that the peak energy h\u03bd\u2217\u2217 becomes nearly the maximum energy.\nThus, the above estimate may be an overestimate for such a case.\nThe total photoelectric heating by dust is given by \u0393pe = nd \u03b3, where nd is the grain\nnumber density and \u03b3 is the heating rate per a grain. While nd \u221d na\u22123 for a certain dust-togas ratio, \u03b3 is proportional to hEpe ia2 nT 1/2 x because the photoelectric ionization rate per a\ngrain balances with the electron capture rate per a grain, where a2 dependence comes from\nthe geometrical cross section of grains. We have assumed x \u226b 1 again. On the other hand,\nthe photoionization heating rate, \u0393Hpi , is proportional to n2 T \u22120.7 in the photoionization\nequilibrium, where the temperature dependence comes from the recombination coefficient.\nTherefore, we find\n\u0393pe\n\u221d a\u22121 x2 T 2.2 ,\n\u0393Hpi\n\n(A7)\n\nwhere we have used the relation hEpe i \u221d xT (equation [A6]). Remembering J, n, and T\ndependences in x described in equation (A4), we can understand J, n, and T dependences\n\n\f30\n\nA. K. Inoue & H. Kamaya\n\nshown in figures A3 (b), (c), and (d). Because QL \u221d a for a . 0.1 \u03bcm and QL \u223c 1 for\notherwise, we see a double power-law dependence of a in panel (a) of figure A3.\n\nA2\n\nEffect of the spectral break\n\nAs shown by Haardt & Madau (1996), the real spectrum may show a break at the He II\nLyman limit (54.4 eV), whereas we have assumed a spectrum without break. Here this point\nis discussed. Assuming the power-law spectral index (\u03b1) is fixed all over the spectral range\nfor simplicity, we multiply the intensity of the background radiation above the He II Lyman\nlimit by a factor of fHeII , which is called the spectral break factor in this appendix. As\nextreme cases, fHeII = 1 means that there is no break, and fHeII = 0 means that there is no\nphoton above the He II Lyman limit. In all calculations, except for figure A4, fHeII = 1 has\nbeen assumed.\nFigure A4 shows the effect of fHeII on the normalized mean photoelectron energy from\ndust grains (hEpe i/kB T ), which indicates the heating efficiency per a grain. Only the silicate\ncase is shown, but the graphite case is very similar. For \u03b1 = 1 case (dotted curves), we\nobserve the photoelectron energy hEpe i/kB T decreases with decreasing fHeII . This is because\nthe number of high energy photons decreases if the spectral break is larger (i.e. smaller fHeII ).\nAccording to figure 5 in Haardt & Madau (1996), the break is significant like fHeII \u223c 0.1.\nOne might think that our assumption of fHeII = 1 with \u03b1 = 1 results in an overestimation\nof the dust heating, so that a larger amount of dust may be allowed in the IGM.\nHowever, figure 5 of Haardt & Madau (1996) also shows that the spectral index is 0.5\nrather than unity for . 1 keV photons which we are interested in. In the \u03b1 = 0.5 case\n(solid curves of figure A4), we find a good quantitative agreement with the case of fHeII = 1\nand \u03b1 = 1 (top dotted curve) if fHeII = 0.1\u20130.3. Therefore, our results obtained from the\nbackground spectrum of fHeII = 1 and \u03b1 = 1 should be quantitatively very consistent with\nthose from a more realistic spectrum with the He II Lyman limit break.\n\nAPPENDIX B: CHEMICAL RATE EQUATIONS AND COEFFICIENTS\nIn this paper, we consider HI, HII, HeI, HeII, HeIII, and electron as gaseous species.

Therefore, the term of dX/dt in equation (6) of section 4.1 is reduced to \u2212dXHI /dt \u2212 dXHeI /dt + dXHeIII /dt because of dX/dt =\nequation (B5).\n\nP\n\ni\n\ndXi /dt = dXe /dt and\n\nWe now consider the atomic photoionization heating and the photoelectric heating by\n\n\fAmount of Intergalactic Dust\n\n33\n\nTable B3.
