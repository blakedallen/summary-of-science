A biquandle may also be\nunderstood as a solution S : B \u00d7 B \u2192 B \u00d7 B to the set-theoretic Yang-Baxter equation\n(S \u00d7 Id)(Id \u00d7 S)(S \u00d7 Id) = (Id \u00d7 S)(S \u00d7 Id)(Id \u00d7 S)\nwhich satisfies some additional criteria corresponding to the first and second Reidemeister moves.\nSuch a map S is called a switch, and a biquandle is an invertible switch with components S(a, b) =\n(ba , ab ) satisfying S \u22121 (a, b) = (ba , ab ) and the extra conditions required by the reverse type II and\ntype I moves.\nThis relationship between the biquandle axioms and the Reidemeister moves makes biquandles a natural source of knot and link invariants. For example, the biquandle counting invariant\n|Hom(B(L), T )| is the cardinality of the set of biquandle homomorphisms from the knot biquandle\nof a link L into a finite target biquandle T . One can think of each homomorphism as a \"coloring\" of\nthe link diagram by T , assigning an element of T to every semiarc in a diagram of L such that the\nbiquandle operations are satisfied at every crossing; we can then see that this family of invariants is\n\nFigure 1: Biquandle operations at crossings\n\n1\n\n\fa generalization of Fox's n-coloring invariants. Indeed, biquandles generalize quandles which in turn\ngeneralize knot groups. Biquandles have been studied in recent papers such as [4], [6], [2] and more.\nMany of the examples of biquandles in the current literature are natural generalizations of types of\nquandle structures \u2013 Alexander biquandles generalize Alexander quandles, Silver-Williams switches\ngeneralize Joyce's homogeneous quandles, etc. In this paper we generalize the symplectic quandles\nstudied in [8] (also known as quandles of transvections) to define what we call bilinear biquandles.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we list the biquandle axioms and give examples\nof biquandles. In section 3 we define bilinear biquandles, obtain some results about their structure\nand give an example of bilinear biquandle which is not a quandle. In section 4 we generalize the\nsymplectic quandle polynomial invariants defined in [8] to the biquandle case and give some examples\nof classical and virtual links which have the same value for the biquandle counting invariant but\nare distinguished by the bilinear biquandle invariant. In section 5, we list all bilinear biquandle\nstructures with cardinality up to 27 as determined by our computer search. In section 6, we end\nwith some questions for further research.\n\n2\n\nBiquandles and symplectic quandles\n\nLet B be a set. A biquandle structure on B consists of four binary operations (a, b) 7\u2192 ab , ab , ab and\nab such that\n1. For every a, b \u2208 B we have\na = abba ,\n\na = abba ,\n\nb = baab ,\n\nand b = baab ,\n\n2. for every a, b \u2208 B there exist x, y \u2208 B such that\nx = abx ,\n\na = xb ,\n\ny = aby ,\n\nb = bxa ,\n\na = yb ,\n\nand b = bya ,\n\n3 for every a, b, c \u2208 B we have\nc\n\nabc = acb b ,\nc\n\nabc = acb b ,\n\ncba = cab ba ,\n\ncba = ca\n\nb ba\n\n,\n\n(ba )cab = (bc )acb ,\n\nand\n\n(ba )\n\nc\n\nab\n\n= (bc )\n\na\n\nc\n\nb\n\n,\n\n4. for every a \u2208 B there exist x, y \u2208 B such that\nx = ax ,\n\na = xa , y = ay\n\nand a = ya .\n\nThese axioms are obtained from the oriented Reidemeister moves by thinking of each semiarc\n(portion of the knot diagram between over/under crossing points) as a biquandle element; the\nbiquandle elements on the outside of each pictured diagram portion must then agree before and\nafter the move. For example, the oriented type III move with all positive crossings is below:\n\nWhile there are eight oriented type III moves, in the presence of the oriented type II moves we\nneed only the two type III moves with all positive and all negative crossings. See [6] for more.\n2\n\n\fExample 1 A quandle is a set Q with binary operations ., .\u22121 : Q \u00d7 Q \u2192 Q such that\n(i) for all a \u2208 Q, a . a = a,\n(ii) for all a, b \u2208 Q we have (a . b) .\u22121 b = a = (a .\u22121 b) . b and\n(iii) for all a, b, c \u2208 Q we have (a . b) . c = (a . c) . (b . c).\nEvery quandle is a biquandle with ab = a . b, ab = a .\u22121 b, and ab = ab = a.\nExample 2 As an example of a non-quandle biquandle, let B = Zn and let s, t \u2208 Zn be invertible\nelements. Then B is a biquandle with\nab = ta + (1 \u2212 st)b,\n\nab = t\u22121 a + (1 \u2212 s\u22121 t\u22121 )b,\n\nab = sa,\n\nand\n\nab = s\u22121 a.\n\nExample 3 More generally, let M be any module over Z[s\u00b11 , t\u00b11 ]. Then M is a biquandle under\nthe operations defined in example 2, called an Alexander biquandle. See [6] and [7] for more.\nExample 4 Let D be an oriented link diagram, i.e. a planar 4-valent graph with two inward-oriented\nand two outward-oriented edges incident on every vertex, with vertices decorated to indicate crossing\ninformation. Then the knot biquandle B(L) of the link represented by L has a presentation with one\ngenerator for each edge and relations at each crossing as depicted in figure 1. The elements of the\nknot biquandle are equivalence classes of biquandle words in these generators under the equivalence\nrelation generated by the biquandle axioms and the crossing relations. For example, the trefoil knot\nbelow has the listed knot biquandle.\n\nha, b, c, d, e, f\n\n|\n\nad = b, be = c, cf = d,\nda = e, eb = f, fc = ai.\n\nIf we drop the planarity requirement, such a D defines a virtual link, and we obtain a knot biquandle\nby the same procedure. Crossings arising from non-planarity are depicted as circled intersections;\nsee [5] for more about virtual knots and links.\nIf B = {x1 , . . . , xn } is a finite biquandle, we can represent B symbolically with a 2n \u00d7 2n block\nmatrix, where the four n \u00d7 n blocks encode the four biquandle operations. That is, we let\n\uf8f1\n(xi )(xj ) l = 1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\uf8f2\n1\n2\nM\nM\n(xi )(xj ) l = 2\nl\nMB =\nMij\n= k where xk =\n3\n4\nM\nM\n(x )\nl=3\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 i (xj )\n(xi )(xj ) l = 4\nFor example, the Alexander biquandle B = Z3 with\n\uf8ee\n3 2 1 3\n\uf8ef 1 3 2 1\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef 2 1 3 2\nMB = \uf8ef\n\uf8ef 2 2 2 2\n\uf8ef\n\uf8f0 1 1 1 1\n3 3 3 3\n\ns = 2, t = 1 has biquandle matrix\n\uf8f9\n2 1\n3 2 \uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n1 3 \uf8fa\n\uf8fa.\n2 2 \uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n1 1 \uf8fb\n3 3\n\nBiquandle matrices can be used to compute the biquandle counting invariant |Hom(B(K), T )|\nand the Yang-Baxter 2-cocycle invariants of a knot or link in an algebra-agnostic way; see [9] and\n[3] for more.\n3\n\n\fExample 5 As a final example of a non-quandle biquandle structure, let R be a ring with identity\nand M an R-module. Then the operations\nxy = Cx + Dy\n\nyx = Ax + By,\n\nwith A, B \u2208 R and C = A\u22121 B \u22121 A(1 \u2212 A) and D = 1 \u2212 A\u22121 B \u22121 AB define an invertible switch\nS : M \u00d7 M \u2192 M \u00d7 M by S(x, y) = (yx , xy ) provided [B, (A \u2212 I)(A, B)] = 0 where [X, Y ] =\nXY \u2212 Y X and (X, Y ) = X \u22121 Y \u22121 XY ; such a switch gives a biquandle structure with barred\noperations S \u22121 (x, y) = (xy , yx ) provided the axioms arising from the type I and reverse type II\nmoves are satisfied. See [1] for more.\n\n3\n\nBilinear biquandles\n\nLet R be any commutative ring and M any free module over R. Let h, i : M \u00d7 M \u2192 R be an\nantisymmetric bilinear form. Then M is a biquandle with operations\nxy = x \u2212 hx, yiy,\n\nxy = x + hx, yiy,\n\nxy = x\n\nand xy = x.\n\nSuch a biquandle is in fact a quandle; quandles of this type have been called symplectic quandles or\nquandles of transvections. See [8] and [10].\nWe would like to extend this definition to define non-quandle biquandles.\nDefinition 1 Let M be a free module over a commutative ring R. A bilinear biquandle structure\non M is a biquandle structure on M such that\nxy = \u03b1x + f (x, y)y,\n\nxy = \u03b10 x + f 0 (x, y)y,\n\nxy = \u03b2x\n\nand\n\nxy = \u03b2 0 x,\n\nwhere \u03b1, \u03b10 , \u03b2, \u03b2 0 \u2208 R and f,0 f : M \u00d7 M \u2192 R are bilinear forms.\nWe know already that \u03b1 = \u03b10 = \u03b2 = \u03b2 0 = 1, f 0 (x, y) = \u2212f (x, y), f an antisymmetric bilinear\nform gives us a biquandle structure, namely the symplectic quandle structure just described. We\nwould like to know, then, what other bilinear biquandles are possible?\nWe start with some observations.\nProposition 1 Let M be a bilinear biquandle. Then \u03b10 = \u03b1\u22121 and \u03b2 0 = \u03b2 \u22121 .\nProof. Here we consider the biquandle axioms arising from the direct type II move:\n\nSince ba = \u03b2b, we have baab = \u03b2 0 (\u03b2b) = b, and thus \u03b2\u03b2 0 = 1.\nMoreover, since abba = a for all a, b \u2208 M , taking b = 0 \u2208 M we have a0 = \u03b1a, 0a = 0 and\n0\na = \u03b10 a, and thus a00a = \u03b1\u03b10 a = a and \u03b1\u03b10 = 1.\nProposition 2 For any bilinear biquandle, we must have f (a, a) = \u03b2 \u22121 \u2212 \u03b1 and f 0 (a, a) = \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1\u22121 .\n\n4\n\n\fProof. Consider the biquandle axiom derived from the Reidemeister type I move with a positive\ncrossing:\n\nxa = a\n\nax = x,\n\nHere ax = \u03b2a = x, and we note that this x is unique since \u03b2 is invertible; then\nxa = (\u03b2a)a = \u03b1(\u03b2a) + f (\u03b2a, a)a = (\u03b1\u03b2 + \u03b2f (a, a))a = a\nand hence 1 = \u03b1\u03b2 + \u03b2f (a, a).

Using the direct type II move, we have x = xyyx . Therefore,\nx\n\n=\n\n(\u03b1x + f (x, y)y)\u03b2y\n\n= \u03b10 (\u03b1x + f (x, y)y) + f 0 (\u03b1x + f (x, y)y, \u03b2y)\u03b2y\n= \u03b10 \u03b1x + \u03b10 f (x, y)y + f 0 (\u03b1x, \u03b2y)\u03b2y + f 0 (f (x, y)y, \u03b2y)\u03b2y.\nWe know that \u03b10 = \u03b1\u22121 , so with further simplification, we get\nx = x + \u03b1\u22121 f (x, y)y + \u03b1\u03b2 2 f 0 (x, y)y + \u03b2 2 f (x, y)f 0 (y, y)y.\nWe have f 0 (y, y) = \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1\u22121 , so\nx = x + \u03b1\u22121 f (x, y)y + \u03b1\u03b2 2 f 0 (x, y)y + \u03b2 2 f (x, y)(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1\u22121 )y.\nThen\n0 = \u03b1\u22121 f (x, y)y + \u03b1\u03b2 2 f 0 (x, y)y + \u03b2 2 f (x, y)(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1\u22121 )y,\nand since this is true for all y \u2208 B, we must have\n0 = \u03b1\u22121 f (x, y) + \u03b1\u03b2 2 f 0 (x, y) + \u03b2 2 f (x, y)(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1\u22121 ).\nHence,\n\u2212\u03b1\u03b2 2 f 0 (x, y) = (\u03b1\u22121 + \u03b2 2 (\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1\u22121 ))f (x, y).\n\n5\n\n\fSo,\nf 0 (x, y)\n\n=\n\n(\u2212\u03b1\u22121 \u03b2 \u22122 )(\u03b1\u22121 + \u03b2 3 \u2212 \u03b2 2 \u03b1\u22121 )f (x, y)\n\n=\n\n(\u2212\u03b1\u22122 \u03b2 \u22122 \u2212 \u03b1\u22121 \u03b2 + \u03b1\u22122 )f (x, y).\n\nThe type III Reidemeister move axioms impose conditions on the bilinear form f (x, y) = xAyt :\nProposition 5 In any bilinear biquandle B, we must have\n\u03b1(1 \u2212 \u03b2 2 )f (x, y) = 0\n\nand\n\n\u03b2(1 \u2212 \u03b2 2 )f (x, y) = 0.\n\nIn particular, the entries Aij of the matrix A such that f (x, y) = xAyt with respect to a basis of B\nmust satisfy\n\u03b1(1 \u2212 \u03b2 2 )Aij = \u03b2(1 \u2212 \u03b2 2 )Aij = 0\nfor all i, j.\nProof. The middle strand in the general case gives us the equation (ba )cab = bc acb . Then\n(ba )cab = (\u03b2b)(\u03b2c) = \u03b1(\u03b2b) + f (\u03b2b, \u03b2c)\u03b2c = \u03b1\u03b2b + \u03b2 3 f (b, c)c\nwhile\n(bc )acb = \u03b2(\u03b1b + f (b, c)c) = \u03b1\u03b2b + \u03b2f (b, c)c\nso we must have \u03b2f (b, c) = \u03b2 3 f (b, c) for all b, c \u2208 B.\nNow, we note that x0 = \u03b1x + f (x, 0)0 = \u03b1x. The undercrossing strand gives us the equation\nb\nbc\na = abc c , so the special case c = 0 says\nab0 = \u03b1(ab ) = \u03b1(\u03b1a + f (a, b)b) = \u03b12 a + \u03b1f (a, b)b\nwhile\n\nb\n\nab0 0 = a(\u03b2b)0 = \u03b1(\u03b1a + f (a, \u03b2b)\u03b2b) = \u03b12 a + \u03b1\u03b2 2 f (a, b)b\nand hence \u03b1f (a, b) = \u03b1\u03b2 2 f (a, b) for all a, b \u2208 B.\nThese observations constrain the possible bilinear biquandle structures on (Zn )m enough to make\nit practical to find all such biquandle structures for small values of n and m by computer search.\nSpecifically, given invertible \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 Zn , we compute the corresponding list of all x \u2208 Zn satisfying\n\u03b1(1 \u2212 \u03b2 2 )x = \u03b2(1 \u2212 \u03b2 2 )x = 0; these are candidates for entries in an m \u00d7 m matrix A, with diagonal\nentries \u03b2 \u22121 \u2212 \u03b1. We then compute the biquandle operation matrix for each triple (\u03b1, \u03b2, A) over the\nset (Zn )m and test the resulting operation matrix for the biquandle axioms, rejecting any triples\nwhich fail to satisfy all of the axioms. Maple code implementing this procedure for (Zn )2 and (Zn )3\nis available in the file bilinear-biquandles.txt downloadable from www.esotericka.org. The\nresults for (Z2 )2 , (Z3 )2 , (Z4 )2 , (Z5 )2 , (Z2 )3 , (Z3 )3 and (Z2 )4 are collected in section 5.\n\u0014\n\u0015\n0 2\nExample 6 Let T = (Z4 )2 and let \u03b1 = \u03b2 = 3, \u03c9 = \u2212\u03b1\u22122 \u03b2 \u22122 \u2212 \u03b1\u22121 \u03b2 + \u03b1\u22122 = 1 and A =\n.\n2 0\nThen one checks that the operations\n\u0014\n\u0015\n0 2\nxy = xy = 3x + x\nyt y,\nxy = 3x = xy\n2 0\ndefine a bilinear biquandle structure on T .\nFor example, let x = (x1 , x2 ) and y = (y1 , y2 ). Then after a bit of arithmetic we find that\nxyyx\n\n=\n\n(x1 + 20x2 y12 + 20y1 x1 y2 + 72y2 x2 y13 + 72y12 x1 y22 ,\nx2 + 20y2 x2 y1 + 20x1 y22 + 72y22 x2 y11 + 72y1 x1 y23 )\n\nwhich is just (x1 , x2 ) in (Z4 )2 .\n6\n\n\f4\n\nLink invariants from bilinear biquandles\n\nSince a bilinear biquandle is not just a biquandle but also an R-module, we can take advantage of\nthis extra structure to enhance the biquandle counting invariant as in [8].\nDefinition 2 Let L be a link, B(L) the knot biquandle of L and T a finite bilinear biquandle.\nDefine the bilinear biquandle polynomial of L with respect to T to be\nX\n\u03c6BB (L, T, q, z) =\nq |Im(f )| z |Span(Im(f ))| .\nf \u2208Hom(B(L),T )\n\nSince \u03c6BB is determined by the set Hom(B(L), M ) which is an invariant of link type, so is \u03c6BB .\nIn particular, \u03c6BB specializes to the biquandle counting invariant |Hom(B(L), M )| when q = z = 1,\nthough in general \u03c6BB contains more information than the counting invariant alone.\nExample 7 Let T be the bilinear biquandle defined in example 6. Then the pictured virtual link L\nis distinguished from the trefoil knot 31 by the associated bilinear biquandle invariant \u03c6BB , though\nboth links have the same counting invariant value.\n\u03c6BB (L, T, q, z) = qz + 6q 2 z 2 + 3qz 2 + 6q 2 z 4\n|Hom(B(L), T )| = 16\n\n\u03c6BB (31 , T, z, q) = qz + 3qz 2 + 12q 2 z 4\n|Hom(B(L), T )| = 16\n\nNote that if we specialize z = 1, ignoring the module structure and using only the biquandle\nstructure, the resulting invariant fails to distinguish the virtual links as both reduce to q + 3q + 12q 2 .\nExample 8 Each monomial in a value of \u03c6BB corresponds to a sub-biquandle of the target biquandle, namely the image of the knot biquandle under some homomorphism. If two knots or links\nhave different values of \u03c6BB , the difference in these values can yield information about the difference\nbetween the knots not apparent from the counting invariant alone. Let T be the bilinear biquandle\nT = (Z4 )2 with\n\u0014\n\u0015\n2 1\ny\ny\nx =x =x+x\nyt y,\nxy = xy = 3x\n1 2\nThen the links L1 and L2 have invariant values \u03c6BB (L1 ) = qz+48q 3 z 4 +6q 2 z 2 +30q 2 z 4 +72q 4 z 8 +3qz 2\nand \u03c6BB (L2 ) = qz+6q 2 z 2 +30q 2 z 4 +3qz 2 respectively. Thus, there are sub-biquandles of B1 , B2 \u2282 T\nwith cardinality 3 and 4 respectively such that L1 has biquandle colorings by B1 and B2 while L2\ndoes not. Moreover, the submodule spanned by B1 has cardinality 4, while the submodule spanned\nby B2 has cardinality 8.\n\n7\n\n\f5\n\nBilinear biquandles of small cardinality\n\nIn table 1 we list the results of our computer search for bilinear biquandles of small cardinality.\nThese results were obtained using Maple programs in the file bilinear-biquandles.txt available\nat www.esotericka.org/quandles.

Are there any examples of such\nbiquandles?\nWe notice from table 1 that for n = 2, 3, 5 the only bilinear biquandle structures on (Zn )m we\nseem to find are only slight variations of the symplectic quandle structure \u2013 the bilinear form is\nantisymmetric and \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 {\u22121, 1}. Does this pattern hold for all prime n?\nThere are, of course other possible combinations of module elements and bilinear forms similar\nto the symplectic quandle structure that one could use in looking for finite biquandles, such as\n(x, y) 7\u2192 fi (x, y)x + gi (x, y)y,\n\ni = 1, 2, 3, 4\n\nor\n(x, y) 7\u2192 Ai x + gi (x, y)y,\n\ni = 1, 2, 3, 4\n\nwhere fi , gi are bilinear forms and Ai \u2208 Mm (R). All of these should have \u03c6BB type invariants\nassociated. Which of these formats give interesting new finite biquandles?\n8\n\n\fReferences\n[1] S. Budden and R. Fenn.
