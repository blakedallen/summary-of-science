Introduction\nModelling credit risk in a coherent yet applicable manner is an important yet challenging\nproblem. The difficulties arise from the combination of a large, and co-dependent set of\nrisk parameters such as default rates, recovery rates, or exposures, which are correlated\nand non-stationary in time. An additional issue is that of credit contagion [1, 2, 4],\nwhich examines the role of counter-party risk in credit risk modelling. If a firm is in\neconomic distress, or defaults, this will implications for any firm which is economically\ninfluenced by this given firm, for example, a service provider to it, purchaser of its goods\nor a bank with a credit line to the firm. The direct correlations between firms caused by\ncredit contagion lead to further complications in modelling the overall, either portfolio\nor economy wide, level of risk. Jarrow and Yu [1] introduced a framework of primary\nand secondary firms, the former would default depending on some background stochastic\nprocess while the latter were affected by a stochastic process and the performance of\nthe primary firms. They argued that this was a reasonable level of detail for their\npurposes and it also simplifies matters as there are no feedback loops in the system.\nSecondary firms depend only on primary firms whose performance is independent of\nthe secondary firms. Another approach for modelling credit contagion dynamics was\nprovided by Giesecke and Weber [2] who used the well known voter process [3], from\nthe theory of interacting particle systems, to model interactions between firms. They\nassumed a regular structure for their firms (a regular hyper-cubic lattice) and focussed\non the equilibrium properties of their model. Davis and Lo [4] considered a model in\n\n\fCredit contagion and credit risk\n\n2\n\nwhich defaults occur either directly, or through infection by another defaulted firm,\nwith probabilities for direct default or infection taken uniform throughout the system.\nDefaults occurring due to both, endogenous or exogenous causes were not considered in\ntheir set-up.\nThere are a variety of techniques for modelling the correlations between firms'\ndefault behaviour, which is a major complication in credit risk modelling. The binomial\nexpansion technique assumes independence between firms so that the number of defaults\nin a portfolio is described by a binomial distribution. In order to capture the effects\nof correlations a binomial distribution with an \"effective\" number of firms is assumed\nwhich is smaller than the actual number in the portfolio, but the weight given to\neach firm scaled so as to keep the mean number of defaults constant, while the\nvariance of the overall number of defaults is increased. The relationship between\nthe true number of firms and the effective reduced number is a modelling choice that\ndepends on the diversity of the firms in terms of sectors, geographic locations or any\nother identifiable trait that would lead to strong correlations in default behaviour.\nJP Morgans' CreditMetrics approach [5] and Credit Suisse First Financial Products\nCreditRisk+ [6] (see [7] for a detailed comparison between the two) uses the correlations\nin equity values as a surrogate for the correlations in credit quality. The structural\nmodelling approach goes back a long way to work by Merton [8] which directly models\nthe dynamics of a firm's assets, with default being triggered by the asset value hitting\nsome predetermined value (which henceforth we take without loss of generality to be\nzero). Correlations between firms are due to correlations in the dynamics of different\nfirms' assets. This approach is very general, as it is relatively transparent to identify\ndifferent driving forces of asset levels and straightforward to include them in the model\n(though the resulting model itself will be non-trivial). However, it suffers from the fact\nthat the asset level is not an observable quantity [9]. On the other hand, the reduced\nform approach gives default rates for a given firm without modelling the underlying\ndefault process. Correlations are then directly introduced between the default rates.\nThere was some discussion in the literature about whether the reduced form model\ncould describe the true level of default correlations seen empirically but Yu [10] seems\nto have answered this question in the affirmative if a suitable structure between the\ndefault rates is taken into account.\nThe approach we take here is a discrete time Markov process (at the microeconomic\nlevel) where the probability of a default of a given firm in a particular time step depends\nmaterially on the state of its economic partners at the start of that time step, as\nwell as on macro-economic influences. Using techniques developed in the statistical\nmechanics of disordered systems, and recently applied to this specific model in [11],\nwe are able to solve our model exactly, and given our assumptions that we describe\nshortly, this solution takes a particularly simple form despite the fact that in principle we\nhave feedback correlations, non-equilibrium dynamics and in principle non-Markovian\nbehaviour at the macroscopic (economy/portfolio wide) level. We note that it is possible\nto frame our model in either the structural approach or the reduced form approach,\n\n\fCredit contagion and credit risk\n\n3\n\ndepending on requirements and taste, although the interpretation of the variables in\nthe two approaches will of course be different. We find that the correlations introduced\nthrough credit contagion lead to large increases in default rates in times of economic\nstress, above and beyond those introduced by simple macro-economic dependencies.\nThis has strong implications for portfolio risk management.\n2. The microeconomic framework\nWe will analyse an economy of N firms in the large N limit. Generally, we focus on the\ncharacteristic changes in the economy due to interactions between firms, which will be\ndescribed in a probabilistic manner.\nAs mentioned in the introduction we take a discrete time approach. For clarity\nwe restrict our discussion to a one year time frame split into twelve steps; this is not\nessential, but parameters may need rescaling depending on the set-up. We use a binary\nindicator variable ni,t to denote whether firm i is solvent at time t (ni,t = 0) or has\ndefaulted (ni,t = 1). The default process is a function of an underlying stochastic\nprocess for each firm in terms of a \"wealth\" variable Wi,t , where we assume default if\nthe wealth drops below zero. We shall assume that recovery from default over the time\nhorizon of a year is not possible, so that the defaulted state is absorbing. As a function\nof the wealth, therefore, the indicator variables evolve according to\nni,t+1 = ni,t + (1 \u2212 ni,t )\u0398(\u2212Wi,t ) ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u0398(. . .) is the Heavyside function.\nA dynamic model for the indicator variables is obtained from (1) by specifying the\nunderlying stochastic process for the wealth variables Wi,t . We shall take it to be of the\nform\nWi,t = \u03b8i \u2212\n\nN\nX\n\nj=1\n\nJij nj,t \u2212 \u03b7i,t .\n\n(2)\n\nHere \u03b8i denotes an initial wealth of firm i at the beginning of the risk horizon, and Jij\nquantifies the material impact on the wealth of firm i that would be caused by a default\nof firm j. This may or may not be a reduction in wealth, depending on whether j has\na cooperative (Jij > 0) or a competitive (Jij < 0) economic relation with i.\nWe shall assume that the fluctuating contributions \u03b7i,t to (2) are zero-mean\nGaussians. There is still some degree of flexibility concerning the decomposition of\nthe \u03b7i,t into contributions that are intrinsic to the firm and extrinsic contributions. The\nlatter describe the influence of economy-wide fluctuations or fluctuations pertaining\nto different economic sectors, depending on the level of detail required. We restrict\nourselves to a minimal model containing a single macro-economic factor (assumed to be\nconstant over a risk horizon of a year), and individual fluctuations for each firm,\n\u0013\n\u0012\nq\n\u221a\n\u03c1i \u03b70 + 1 \u2212 \u03c1i \u03bei,t ,\n(3)\n\u03b7i,t = \u03c3i\n\n\fCredit contagion and credit risk\n\n4\n\nwhere \u03c3i sets the scale of the individual fluctuations, and the {\u03bei,t} are taken to be\nindependent N (0, 1) Gaussians; finally, the parameters \u03c1i quantify the correlations of the\n\u03b7i,t created via the coupling to economy-wide fluctuations \u03b70 , also taken to be N (0, 1).\nUp to this point the wealth dynamics does not contain an endogenous drift. If\npredictions are required over longer time periods then it may also be pertinent to\nintroduce such a drift, e.g. by using a time-dependent \u03b8i for example, \u03b8i,t = \u03b8i (0)ezi t ,\nwhere zi denotes an intrinsic growth rate of the average wealth of firm i (with zi > 0\nfor a firm making profits and zi < 0 for a firm making losses). However, for the current\npurposes of examining default rates over the medium term and especially focussing on\nthe behaviour on the tails, this adjustment does not lead to significant changes in our\noverall conclusion.\nThe model, as formulated above, clearly takes a structural point of view on\nthe problem of credit contagion. However, we note that the dynamics (1) of the\nindicator variables is clearly independent of the scale of the wealth variables Wi,t . By\nappropriately rescaling the initial wealths \u03b8i and the impact parameters Jij we can\nthus assume a unit-scale \u03c3i \u2261 1 for the noise variables (3). Interestingly, this simple\nrescaling, which leaves the dynamics of the system unaffected, amounts to changing to\na reduced-form interpretation of the dynamics.\nTo see this, note from (2) that the event Wi,t < 0 is equivalent to \u03b7i,t >\nPN\nP\n\u03b8i \u2212 j=1 Jij nj,t . With \u03c3i \u2261 1, we see that this occurs with probability \u03a6( j Jij nj,t \u2212\u03b8i )\nwhere \u03a6(*) is the cumulative normal distribution. From a reduced form point of view this\nis just the intensity of default of firm i at time step t (in a given economic environment\nspecified by the set of firms defaulted at time t). This allows us to re-interpret the\n(rescaled) initial wealth and impact variables \u03b8i and Jij in terms of the bare default\nprobabilities [11, 12, 13]. I.e., if company i has an expected default probability of pi in\na given time unit (e.g. one month in the present set-up) as predicted from tables from\nratings agencies, then \u03b8i = \u2212\u03a6\u22121 (pi ). Similarly, the expected default probability pi|j of\nfirm i, given that only firm j has defaulted leads to the value Jij = \u03a6\u22121 (pi|j ) \u2212 \u03a6\u22121 (pi ).\nIn determining the model parameters by the method suggested above we are\nsplitting our default probability into terms that come from credit contagion and other\nterms such as the bare default probability that come from historical data. It could\nfairly be argued that the historical data already incorporate the credit contagion terms\nand thus we are double counting. As we will see later in numerical simulations, the\ncredit contagion terms make very little difference to average behaviour and thus making\nestimates based on average historical data is still a reasonable approach.\nIn choosing the variable \u03c1i we follow the prescription given by BASEL II [14] which\nsets\n!\n\u0011\n\u0010\n1 \u2212 e\u221250PDi\n1 \u2212 e\u221250PDi\n\u221250PDi\n(4)\n\u2248\n0.12\n1\n+\ne\n+\n0.24\n1\n\u2212\n\u03c1i = 0.12\n1 \u2212 e\u221250\n1 \u2212 e\u221250\nwhere PDi gives the probability of default of firm i over one year, ignoring credit\ncontagion effects. With pi = \u03a6(\u2212\u03b8i ) as the monthly default probability, we have\nPDi \u2248 12\u03a6(\u2212\u03b8i ).\n\n\f5\n\nCredit contagion and credit risk\n\nWe still have to specify the form for the economic interactions. We adopt here a\nprobabilistic approach, so take them to be random quantities of the form\nJij = cij\n\n\"\n\nJ\nJ0\n+ \u221a xij\nc\nc\n\n#\n\n(5)\n\n.\n\nHere, the cij \u2208 {0, 1} detail the network (presence or absence) of interactions between\ndifferent firms and we choose these to be randomly fixed according to\n\u0013\n\u0012\nc\nc\n\u03b4cij ,0 ,\ni<j ,\ncji = cij .\n(6)\nP (cij ) = \u03b4cij ,1 + 1 \u2212\nN\nN\nWe assume that the average connectivity c of each firm is large in the limit of a large\neconomy; this will allow the influence of partner firms to be described by the central\nlimit theorem and the law of large numbers. Concerning the values of the (non-zero)\nimpact parameters, we parametrise them as shown, with xij assumed to be zero-mean,\nunit-variance random variables, with finite moments, and independent in pairs,\nxij = 0 ,\n\nx2ij = 1 ,\n\nxij xji = \u03b1 ,\n\nxij xkl = 0 otherwise .\n\n(7)\n\nThe parameters J0 and J determine mean and variance of the interaction strengths; the\n\u221a\nscaling of mean and variance with c and c respectively in (5) is necessary to allow\na meaningful large c limit to be taken. Taking J0 > 0 would encode the fact that on\naverage firms have a synergy with their economic partners.\nAt first sight, specifying the Jij appears to introduce a vast number of parameters\ninto our model, but in fact only the first two moments of the distribution of interaction\nstrengths are sufficient to determine the macroscopic behaviour of the system, and so\nthe model space is not too large.\nLet us now turn to the capital required to be held against credit risk. In the BASEL\nII document [14] the capital requirement for a unit-size loan given to firm i is\n!\n#\n\"\n\u221a\n\u03c1i \u03a6\u22121 (0.999) + \u03a6\u22121 (PDi )\n\u221a\n\u2212 PDi Mi .\n(8)\nKi = LGDi \u03a6\n1 \u2212 \u03c1i\n\nThe first factor, the loss given default LGDi of firm i, is related to the average fraction\nof a loan that can be recovered despite default. The last factor, Mi , is related to the\nmaturity (long dated loans are inherently riskier). Adjustments related to liquidity (low\nliquidity loans are risker) and concentration (fewer, larger loans give a greater variance\nin returns for given expected return) are occasionally also included in this factor -\nconcentration-adjustments, in fact, are a means to account for reduced granularity in a\ncredit portfolio resulting from the possibility of credit contagion.\nThe factor inside square brackets in (8) is entirely related to the loss-frequency\ndistribution. The first term is the value of the loss frequency not exceeded with\nprobability q = 0.999 under fluctuating macro-economic conditions, with \u03c1i describing\nthe dependence of the firm's loss-frequency on the macro-economic factor. The second\nterm is the average loss frequency. The value of the confidence level q is in principle\narbitrary, but is related to the target rating of the bank. The risk weighted asset is\nthen found by further multiplying by terms such as the exposure at default (i.e. size of\nthe loan). Thus the capital required for firm i can be viewed as the loss at the 99.9th\n\n\fCredit contagion and credit risk\n\n6\n\npercentile level of stress, in excess of the expected loss, multiplied by a conversion\nfactor. From this structure it is clear that a key ingredient for the capital adequacy\nrequirements is a good model of credit risk that works well into the tail of the loss\nfrequency distribution.\nReturning to our description of default dynamics, let us first focus on the case of\nindependent firms, with Jij = 0 \u2200i, j, and consider a single epoch for our model with\nfluctuating forces given by (3) at given macro-economic condition \u03b70 . The probability of\na default of firm i with average unconditional monthly default probability pi occurring\nduring the epoch t \u2192 t + 1 in our model is given by\n!\n\u221a\n\u03c1i \u03b70 + \u03a6\u22121 (pi )\n\u221a\n(9)\nhni,t+1 |ni,t = 0i = \u03a6\n1 \u2212 \u03c1i\nSince the probability of default is increasing with \u03b70 , we can find the probability of\ndefault not exceeded at e.g. the 99.9 percent confidence level; it is given by setting\n\u03b70 = \u03a6\u22121 (0.999) in the above equation (recall \u03b70 is distributed as a zero-mean, unitvariance Gaussian random number). As above, the excess capital required is the loss at\nthe 99.9th percent level minus the expected loss (multiplied by a risk factor). However,\nwhen we consider the case of an interacting economy with non-zero Jij , we find that in\nfact\n!\n\u221a\nJ0 mt + \u03c1i \u03b70 \u2212 \u03b8i\n\u221a\n,\n(10)\nhni,t+1 |ni,t = 0i = \u03a6\n1 \u2212 \u03c1i + J 2 mt\nwhere\n1 X\nmt =\nnj,t\n(11)\nN j\nis the fraction of firms within the economy that have defaulted up to time t; we also\nexpressed the expected monthly default rate pi in terms of a 'rescaled initial wealth' \u03b8i ,\n\u03a6\u22121 (pi ) = \u2212\u03b8i .\nThus we find that our formulation is very similar to that used in BASEL II. However,\nwe directly take account of the correlations in defaults caused by credit contagion.\nThis introduces two extra parameters into the model but it does markedly change the\nbehaviour in the tails of the loss frequency distribution, and thereby in the tails of the\nloss distribution itself. Correlation between firms is essentially a dynamic phenomenon\n- if there is no dynamics, there is no way for one's firms' performance to influence\nthe viability of any other firm. Thus rather than considering firms to be independent\nover a single epoch which lasts the entire period of any loan, we split the overall time\n(e.g. one year) into smaller units (e.g. one month) and let the firms evolve over these\nsmaller time units with the default probability adjusted (since the default event in 12\nmonthly epochs is compounded 12 times as opposed to a single epoch). A firm may\ndefault at any point, but will then influence its partner firms for the remainder of the\ntime horizon. The complexity of the theory is merely linear in time, thus it is not a\ngreat computational burden to choose this approach.\nFollowing the approach described in [11] it is possible to solve the model in a\nstochastic manner. Credit contagion within this model is encoded at each time by a\n\n\f7\n\nCredit contagion and credit risk\n\nsingle number, the fraction of firms that have defaulted thus far, which evolves according\nto\nq\n\uf8f6+\n\uf8eb\n*\n\u0010\n\u0011\nJ0 mt + \u03c1(\u03b8) \u03b70 \u2212 \u03b8\n\uf8f8\n(12)\nmt+1 = mt + 1 \u2212 hnt (\u03b8)i \u03a6 \uf8ed q\n1 \u2212 \u03c1(\u03b8) + J 2 mt\n\u03b8\n\nwhere hnt (\u03b8)i denotes the time-dependent monthly default rate of firms with \u03b8i \u2248 \u03b8, as\ninfluenced by interactions with the economy (see Eq (16) of [11]), and the larger angled\nbrackets with subscript \u03b8 denote an average over the bare monthly probabilities of\ndefault for the ensemble of firms, or equivalently over the distribution p(\u03b8) of their\nrescaled initial wealth parameters \u03b8. In (12) the Basel II recommendation which\nlinks correlations to macro-economic factors with (unconditional) default probabilities,\n\u03c1i = \u03c1(pi ) \u2192 \u03c1(\u03b8i ), via (4) is formally taken into account.\nNote that credit contagion affects the dynamics of defaults only via two parameters,\nJ0 and J, which characterise the mean and variance of the impact parameter\ndistribution. Note also that the parameter \u03b1 which quantifies forward-backward\ncorrelation of mutual impacts according to (7) does not appear in the final formulation,\nnor are there any memory-effects in the dynamics, as would normally be expected for\nsystems of this type. The reason for this simplifying feature is in the fact that the\ndefaulted state is taken to be absorbing over the risk horizon of one year.\n3. Results\nWe now turn to presenting a few key results of our analysis. Our results concerning\ndefault dynamics and loss distributions are obtained for an economy in which the\nparameters \u03b8i determining unconditional monthly default probabilities pi according to\n\u03b8i = \u2212\u03a6\u22121 (pi ), are normally distributed with mean \u03b80 = 2.75, and variance \u03c3\u03b82 = 0.1\nso that typical monthly bare default probabilities are in the 10\u22125 \u2212 10\u22123 range. The\ncouplings to the macro-economic factor are chosen to depend on the expected default\nprobabilities according to the Basel II prescription (4).\nIn Fig. 1 we we show that renormalisation (with respect to credit contagion)\nmakes little difference to the typical default dynamics. The evolution of the fraction of\ndefaulted firms in interacting economies differs hardly from that of the non-interacting\neconomy with Jij = 0 \u21d4 (J0 , J) = (0, 0).\nIn marked contrast to this, the tails of loss-frequency and loss distributions are\nstrongly affected by the presence of interactions in the system, as shown in Figs. 2 and\n3. We note that the tails of the loss-frequency distribution and the loss distribution\nare more pronounced than in our previous study [11]. This solely due to the fact that\nin the present paper we followed the Basel II suggestion that relates the coupling of a\ncompany to macro-economic factors with its default probability via (4).\nIn computing the economy-wide losses per node for given macro-economic condition\n\u03b70 ,\n1 X\nni,12 li\n(13)\nL(\u03b70 ) =\nN i\n\n\f8\n\nCredit contagion and credit risk\n0.025\n\n0.02\n\nmt\n\n0.015\n\n0.01\n\n0.005\n\n0\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\nt\n\nFigure 1.

In the large N limit this gives\nZ\n1 X\nn12 (\u03b8i )li = d\u03b8p(\u03b8)hn12 (\u03b8)il(\u03b8)\n(14)\nL(\u03b70 ) = lim\nN \u2192\u221e N\ni\nby the law of large numbers, where l = l(\u03b8) is the mean of the loss distribution\nfor a node with default probability pd (\u03b8). As an example we consider an economy\nwhere average losses are inversely proportional to the unconditional default probabilities\npi = pd (\u03b8i ) = \u03a6(\u2212\u03b8i ),\nl(\u03b8) =\n\nl0\n\u03b5 + pd (\u03b8)\n\n(15)\n\nwith a parameter \u03b5 preventing divergence as pi \u2192 0. In this way, the contribution\nto the total losses will be approximately uniform over the bands of different default\nprobabilities. The distribution of the economy-wide losses per node is driven by the\ndistribution of the macro-economic factor, and is computed analytically as shown in\n[11]. A typical result is shown in Fig. 3, for which we chose the scale l0 = 1 and the\nregularizer \u03b5 = 0.005. Once more economic interactions are seen to strongly affect the\ntail of the loss distribution at large losses, which is due to the possibility of avalanches\nof loss events in times of extreme economic stress.\nNote that we have been dealing here with \"synthetic\" parameter distributions for\naverages of loss distributions, as well as bare monthly failure probabilities. These could\nbe replaced by realistic ones without affecting the general set-up. We have not looked\nspecifically at finite size effects here. In [11] it was shown that they are fairly small.\n\n\f9\n\nCredit contagion and credit risk\n100\n\n10\n\np(m12)\n\n1\n\n0.1\n\n0.01\n\n0.001\n-0.2\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\nm12\n\nFigure 2.

Conclusion\nIn this paper we have looked to incorporate the risk due to credit contagion into\nthe internal ratings based approach discussed in BASEL II. While the mathematical\nsubtleties are discussed in full detail elsewhere [11], essentially the large number of\nneighbours assumed for firms means that the law of large numbers and central limit\ntheorems apply to the interactions, meaning that our theory requires only two more\nparameters than the BASEL II approach. In terms of risk, one of the striking results\nis that while the effect of interactions is relatively weak in typical economic scenarios,\nit is pronounced in times of large economic stress, which leads to a significant fattening\n\n\fCredit contagion and credit risk\n\n10\n\nof the tails of the portfolio loss distribution. This has implications on the fitting of loss\ndistributions to historical data, where care must be taken not only to fit the average\nbehaviour but also to take care with the more extreme events.\nThis touches the issue of model calibration discussed in greater detail in [13].\nWe note that our model requires bare default probabilities and conditional default\nprobabilities as inputs. Historical data, however only contain interaction-renormalised\ndefault probabilities, and thus the problem arises of how to disentangle the two effects.\nConcerning typical behaviour, Fig. 1 shows that the effect of interactions is fairly small,\nand interaction-renormalised default probabilities can, to a first approximation within\nthis model, be taken as substitutes for the bare ones. Concerning conditional default\nprobabilities, these would have to be obtained from refined rating procedures; see [13].\nInterestingly, however, only the low order statistics of these are needed to describe the\ncollective dynamics of the system. Their effect manifests itself only in situations of\neconomic stress, generating fat tails in portfolio loss distributions.\nThe model we have proposed is relatively simple in two important respects. Firstly,\nwe do not take into account credit quality migration but have just two states for our\nfirms, solvent or defaulted. The model could be extended to allow for more states for\neach firm, although the full complexity of non-Markovian dynamics would resurface in\nan attempt to take credit quality migration along these lines into account. Secondly,\nthe firms and their environment are rather homogeneous, which in practical situations is\nof course an approximation. This approximation has been made for convenience rather\nthan out of necessity; the techniques described in [11] can be adapted so as to treat\nsituations with more heterogeneity in local environments. We intend to work on some\nof these possible model generalisations in the future.\nOne advantage of our simple model is that it is exactly solvable and the solution\nitself is not overly involved theoretically or computationally, and we only need to\nintroduce two extra parameters to quantify the effect of economic interactions -\ncompared to the BASEL II approach, which ignores credit contagion altogether.\nAcknowledgements We thank Peter Neu for useful discussions and helpful remarks.\nThis paper has been prepared by the authors as a commentary on the topic as at\nSeptember 2006 and is not a definitive analysis of the subject matter covered.
