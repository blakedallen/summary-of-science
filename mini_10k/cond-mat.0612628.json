Conventionally, in order to produce amorphous metallic\nalloys in the various techniques, a higher cooling rate is required and the resulting\namorphous products are generally very thin, less than 50 \u03bcm, in at least one dimension [1].\nHowever such a small physical size has so far limited industrial/commercial applications of\nthis class of materials. Over the past decades, there has been a large advancement in the\nsynthesis of bulk amorphous alloys via direct casting method [2,3,4,5]. In this method the\ncomposition of alloys is designed to gain the large glass formation ability so that 'bulk'\namorphous alloys with a dimension \u2265 1 mm in all directions can be prepared at a low\ncooling rate. Recently a series of bulk amorphous alloys such as Pd-, Zr-, Mg-, Ln-, Ti-, Fe-,\nand Ni- based bulk glasses have successively been prepared by the direct casting method\n[6]. However, the maximum size of bulk amorphous metallic alloys prepared by means of\ndirect casting method is still confined to its glass formation ability. Especially, for\nimportant bulk magnetic Fe-, Ni- and Co-based amorphous alloys, the maximum size is\nrestricted to less than 10 mm. Furthermore, in order to produce bulk amorphous alloys, the\noptimization of composition frequently degrades their magnetic and mechanical properties.\nThus new techniques to synthesize the bulk amorphous alloys with larger size are still in\nneed.\n\n2\n\n\fThere is a standard metallurgical technique to prepare large chunks of materials,\nwhich is powder consolidation. Since the amorphous metallic alloys were first synthesized\nin 1960 [7], attempts have always been made to produce bulk amorphous alloys from\namorphous powders or ribbons via various powder consolidation techniques. In order to\nretain the initial amorphous structure, the consolidation of amorphous powders and ribbons\nshould be performed well below the glass temperature Tg. However amorphous metallic\nalloys usually have very high strengths at temperatures below Tg. As a result, it is very\ndifficult to produce full density and well-bonded bulk amorphous alloys by means of the\nconventional consolidation technique. Until now the consolidation of the amorphous\nmetallic powders can be performed by four main routines: (1) Static hot pressing technique\n[8]. In this method the consolidation of amorphous metallic powders is usually performed\nunder at a very high pressure at an elevated temperature in the range Tp<T<Tg for a longer\nisothermal time. Here Tp corresponds to the transition temperature from inhomogeneous\ndeformation mode to homogeneous deformation mode and Tg is the glass transition\ntemperature of amorphous metallic powders. A higher compaction density better than 95%\nof the theoretical value can be obtained easily with this method but the bonding of powders\nor ribbons is very weak. So the resulting compacts have bad mechanical and magnetic\nproperties. (2) Dynamic consolidation techniques such as explosive or gun compaction\nmethods [9]. In the dynamic compaction process, a shock wave is sent through the powder.\nThe work of deformation heats the powder heterogeneously. The more deformed regions\nmay reach the melting temperature Tm and the less deformed regions attain much lower\ntemperatures. Following the passage of the shock wave, the cooler regions serve as heat\nsinks for the melted regions. If this energy balance is properly chosen, the hotter regions\n\n3\n\n\fcool sufficiently fast to solidify back into the amorphous phase. (3) Quasistatic\nconsolidation techniques such as warm extrusion [8]. In this compaction process, heat is\ngenerated locally on the particle surfaces by deformation and sliding of the particles over\neach other. Thus the temperature in these surfaces may exceed Tg of amorphous metallic\npowders and an efficient friction weld is produced there to form the bond between the\nparticles. Meanwhile the inner part of the particles remains relatively cold and can serve as\nthe cooling sinks to quench the interface melted bond zones. Compared to method (2), there\nis longer contact time between the particles but smaller deformation energy, i.e. a lower\ntemperature on the surface of the particles, in method (3). By means of methods (2) and (3),\nboth the densification and bonding of the particles in the resulting compacts are better than\nthat produced by method (1). However the bonding strength of the final compacted\nproducts is still unsatisfactory for industrial applications. (4) Hot pressing in the\nsupercooled liquid region. It is based on such a fact that amorphous alloys can become\nundercooled liquid and do not crystallize at the temperature range from the glass transition\ntemperature Tg to the kinetic crystallization temperature Tx in a short time. In the\nsupercooled liquid region amorphous alloys soften and it is helpful for the consolidation of\namorphous alloys. Recently, bulk Zr-based amorphous alloys have been successfully\nproduced via warm extrusion of starting amorphous powders in the supercooled liquid\nregion [10]. The resulting bulk amorphous compacts are fully densified and the compaction\ndensity exceeds 99.5% of the theoretical value. Furthermore the well-bonded bulk\ncompacts have been achieved and the resulting mechanical properties are comparable to\nthat of the corresponding amorphous ribbons that is inspiring.\n\n4\n\n\fComparing the above various compaction methods, it can be found that the above\nmethod (4) is the only way available to produce the compacts for industrial applications.\nHowever this method was only achieved for these systems with the large supercooled liquid\nregion such as Zr-based amorphous alloys. It is not reported until now that this method has\nbeen successfully applied to systems with the small supercooled liquid region such as the\nimportant magnetic amorphous Fe-, Ni- and Co-based alloys.\nRecently, it was found [11] that ferromagnetic bulk amorphous Fe40Ni40P14B6 alloy\nrods with the maximum diameter of ~ 2.5 mm can be prepared by means of a rapid\nquenching technique. In this experiment, we will attempt to perform the compaction of bulk\namorphous Fe40Ni40P14B6 alloy in its supercooled liquid region. Further, as the preliminary\nand basic studies, the compaction between only two bulk amorphous Fe40Ni40P14B6 alloy\ndiscs was considered in this experiment.\n\nII.\n\nExperimental Procedures\n\nFe40Ni40P14B6 ingots were prepared from Fe chips (99.98% pure), Ni spheres\n(99.95% pure), B pieces (99% pure), and Ni2P ingots (The Ni2P ingots used were\nthemselves prepared from powders (98% pure)). After the right proportion was weighed,\nthey were put in a clean fused silica tube and alloying was brought about in a rf induction\nfurnace under Ar atmosphere. All the as-prepared specimens had a mass of ~2 g and would\nbe purified via the fluxing technique. The as-prepared Fe40Ni40P14B6 ingots and the fluxing\nagent, anhydrous B2O3, were put in a clean fused silica tube. The whole system was\nevacuated to ~10-3 Torr and heated up to a temperature about ~200 K above the liquidus Tl\n\n5\n\n\fof Fe40Ni40P14B6 (=1184 K). Prolonged high temperature treatment was applied for about 4\nhour, the impurities and oxides inside the molten Fe40Ni40P14B6 alloy can be removed into\nthe fluxing agent. Then the system was cooled down to room temperature and then the\nfluxed specimen, which was crystalline, was removed and cleaned for subsequent water\nquenching experiment. In the water quenching experiment, the fluxed ingots were again\nmelted in Ar atmosphere and then introduced into a clean, thin-walled (0.1~0.2 mm) fused\nsilica tube with the inner diameter of 1.6 ~ 1.8 mm. Then the whole system was plunged\ninto water for rapid quenching. So the amorphous Fe40Ni40P14B6 alloy rods with the\ndiameter of 1.6~1.8 mm and the length of ~ 4 cm can be produced, and their amorphous\nnature had been verified by means of XRD, DSC and TEM. The details can be found\nelsewhere [11].\nThe as-prepared amorphous Fe40Ni40P14B6 alloy rods with diameters of 1.6 ~ 1.8\nmm were cut into discs with a thickness of 1.5 mm with a oil-cooled BUEHLER ISOMET\nlow speed saw. These amorphous discs were cleaned in 100% alcohol and were subjected\nto subsequent hot pressing experiments. The consolidation of the amorphous Fe40Ni40P14B6\nalloy discs was performed in a standard high temperature hot pressing furnace as shown in\nFig. 1(a). The pressure was provided by a manual hydraulic jack with the maximum load of\n10 tones. A graphite die with an inner diameter of 23 mm was used here. In order to avoid\ncontamination of the graphite die during the hot pressing, two steel discs with a thickness\nof 1 mm and a diameter of 22.5 mm were used to separate the graphite die from the\nspecimens. The two as-prepared amorphous Fe40Ni40P14B6 alloy discs were placed one on\ntop of the other to perform the hot pressing experiment as shown in Fig. 1(b). In order to\nprevent the separation of two amorphous discs in the process of hot pressing, the specimens\n\n6\n\n\fwere put into a copper cylinder with a height of 2 mm and an inner/outer diameter of 2\nmm/2.5mm. A K type thermocouple was fastened closely on the top end of the upper\nmount of the graphite die to detect the temperature of the specimens. Since the graphite die\nhas a very good thermal conductivity, and the space occupied by the specimens was very\nsmall, and meanwhile the distance between the thermocouple and the middle part of the\nspecimens was less than 2 mm, it can be concluded that the temperature of the specimens\ncan be measured accurately and timely by the thermocouple in the whole hot pressing\nprocess.\nThe whole system was then connected to a rotary pump to be evacuated to a\nvacuum of 4\u00d710-2 Torr firstly. Then a constant power was provided to the heater and the\ntemperature of the specimens would increase rapidly at the heating rate of 70 ~ 80 K/min.\nAfter the heating process lasts for a certain time, the heater power was turned off. The\ntemperature of the specimens would continue to increase due to the delay effect. As soon as\nthe specimens reached the maximum temperature, a pressure of ~ 20 MPa was applied on\nthe graphite die as rapidly as possible, and the corresponding pressure acting on the\nspecimens was ~ 1.2 GPa. By controlling the heating time, the hot pressing of the\nspecimens at different temperatures Ts can be achieved. The time interval between the\nshutoff of the heater power and the application of the full pressing load was about 1 minute.\nAfter the full pressing load was applied, the temperature of the specimens would be cooled\ndown rapidly at a mean cooling rate of ~ 80 K/min in the temperature range from the hot\npressing temperature Ts to ~573 K, which was due to the contact between the die and the\ncool, large external pressure platen through the steel pressure inducing shaft.\n\n7\n\n\fAfter being cooled down to the ambient temperature, the pressed specimens were\nremoved from the die and were molded into the thermoplastic mold. After a series of\nstandard metallographic procedures: molding, grinding and polishing, a perfect flat surface\nwas produced and was subjected to the optical microscopy observation. The thermal\nanalysis of the as-prepared compacts was performed in Ar protective atmosphere by PerkinElmer DSC7.\n\nIII.\n\nResults\n\nA DSC thermal scan of the as-prepared bulk amorphous Fe40Ni40P14B6 alloy at a\nheating rate of 0.33 K/s is shown in Fig. 2. The corresponding glass transition temperature\nTg and the kinetic crystallization temperature Tx can be determined to be around 659.0 K\nand 691.5 K respectively. It is found that the bulk amorphous Fe40Ni40P14B6 alloy has a\nsupercooled liquid region of about 30 K. In this experiment, the consolidation of the bulk\namorphous Fe40Ni40P14B6 alloy was performed in its supercooled liquid region. The asprepared bulk amorphous Fe40Ni40P14B6 alloy specimens were heated up to a target\ntemperature at a heating rate of 0.66 K/s and were then kept at that temperature in DSC.\nBased on the results of the above isothermal experiments, the TTT curve for the\ncrystallization of the bulk amorphous Fe40Ni40P14B6 alloy can be constructed as shown in\nFig. 3. As can be seen, the amorphous phase in the bulk amorphous Fe40Ni40P14B6 alloy at\n683 K could be retained for 33 s. Therefore, with our experimental setup, it is possible to\nretain the amorphous structure of the original amorphous Fe40Ni40P14B6 alloy specimens at\na consolidated temperature Ts below 683 K.\n\n8\n\n\fThe consolidation of bulk amorphous Fe40Ni40P14B6 alloy discs was performed at\nthe different Ts ranging from Tg to 683 K under a pressure of ~1.2 GPa. Optical\nmicrographs of the polished cross-sectional surface of the compacts consolidated at 658 K,\n663 K, 668 K, 675 K and 681 K are shown in Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7 and Fig. 8,\nrespectively. For Ts = 658 K, two amorphous disc specimens were not joined together and\nthere was a gap in the joint of two amorphous disc specimens. Moreover, there were many\ncracks occurring in the superposition area of the two amorphous alloy discs. For the\ncompacts consolidated at Ts = 663 K, 668 K and 675 K, there were no cracks in the\ncompacts. However, For Ts = 663 K, there was a clear gap in the conjunction area of the\ntwo amorphous alloy discs. For Ts = 668 K, there were still a trace on the polished surface\nof the conjunction area of the two amorphous discs. However, from the enlarged\nmicrograph for the conjunction area as shown in Fig. 6(b), the partial conjunction between\ntwo amorphous discs specimens can be found. For Ts = 675 K, it was found that the two\namorphous disc specimens were been fully fused together as shown in Fig. 7(a). The\nperfect conjunction of the two amorphous alloy discs can be further demonstrated in the\nenlarged image for the conjunction area as shown in Fig. 7(b). For Ts = 681 K, the\namorphous alloy discs were crushed up as shown in Fig. 8.\nThermal scans of the compacts consolidated at different temperatures were\nperformed at the heating rate of 0.33 K/s by means of DSC and are exhibited in Fig. 9(a).\nThe heat of crystallization \u0394Hx and the kinetic crystallization temperature Tx of the\ncompacts can be determined from their thermal scans, and the dependence of \u0394Hx/\u0394Horigin\nand Tx of the compacts upon the consolidated temperature Ts is plotted in Fig. 9(b). Here\n\n9\n\n\f\u0394Horigin is the heat of crystallization of the starting bulk amorphous Fe40Ni40P14B6 alloy.\nThe residual amorphous fraction X in the compacts can be reflected by the value of\n\n\u0394Hx/\u0394Horigin. As shown in Fig. 9(b), the residual amorphous fraction X first decreases\ngradually from 91.6% at Ts = 658 K to 89.8% at Ts = 675 K before it decreases rapidly to\n50.6% at Ts = 681 K. Additionally, Tx of the compacts also decreases gradually from 691.0\nK at Ts = 658 K to 656.5 K at Ts = 681 K. Thus it is found that there is ~ 10% amorphous\nphase crystallized in the compacts consolidated at a temperature below 675K. The\ncrystallization of the compact consolidated at Ts = 675 K was further studied in details. The\ncompact was etched with the 5% Nital solution for two minutes. The overall morphology\nof the etched compact is shown in Fig. 10(a). It can be seen that some crystal clusters\nscattered randomly on the whole surface of the compact. An enlarged photograph in the\nconjunction area is shown in Fig. 10(b) and it can be seen that there are no significant\ndifferences between the morphology of the conjunction area and that of the other parts in\nthe etched compact.\n\nIV.\n\nDiscussions\n\nThe volume fraction of the crystallized material in an amorphous matrix can usually\nbe described very well by the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami theory. For small X:\n\nX=\n\n\u03c0\n3\n\nI sU 3t x\n\n4\n\n(1)\n\nwhere tx is the time taken for X to appear. Is is the steady-state nucleation frequency and can\nbe written as [12]:\n\n10\n\n\fIs =\n\n8n *2 / 3 N A k BT\n\u0394Gn*\nZ exp(\u2212\n)\n3\nk BT\n\u03b7 a0 Vm\n\n(2)\n\nU is the crystal growth velocity and can be expressed by [13]:\nU=\n\n\u239b \u0394Gv \u239e \u23a4\nfk BT \u23a1\n1 \u2212 exp \u239c \u2212\n\u239f\u23a5\n3 \u23a2\n3\u03b7 a0 \u23a3\n\u239d k BT \u23a0 \u23a6\n\n(3)\n\nWith the above equations, the viscosity \u03b7 of the amorphous matrix can be expressed as:\n\n\u03b7=4\n\n\u03c0 8n *2 / 3 N A k BT\n3X\n\n3\n\na0 Vm\n\n\u0394Gn* \u239b fk BT\n)\u239c\nZ exp(\u2212\nk BT \u239c\u239d 3a03\n\n3\n\n\u23a1\n\u239b \u0394Gv \u239e \u23a4 \u239e 4\n\u23a21 \u2212 exp \u239c \u2212\n\u239f \u23a5 \u239f\u239f t x\nk\nT\nB\n\u239d\n\u23a0\u23a6 \u23a0\n\u23a3\n\n(4)\n\nUtilizing the results of the above isothermal experiment as shown in Fig. 3 and assuming\nthat the volume fraction X of crystallized material is 1% at the onset of crystallization in the\nisothermal experiment, the viscosity \u03b7 of bulk amorphous Fe40Ni40P14B6 alloy\ncorresponding to different temperatures in the supercooled liquid region can be estimated\nwith Equ. 4 and is shown in Fig. 11. The setting of all the parameters in calculation can be\nfound elsewhere [14]. Of course, it is well known that tx varies with the heating rate in the\nisothermal experiment. However, here heating rate cannot affect the order of magnitude of\nthe tx value in the temperature range of interest. Therefore the above estimated value of the\nviscosity should be effective in its order of magnitude. Additionally, the average atomic\njump distance of atoms after a time t can be written as [15]:\n\nl = 2.4 Dt\n\n(5)\n\nHere D is the diffusion coefficient and can be expressed by the Stockes-Einstein relation:\nD=\n\nk BT\n3\u03c0 a0\u03b7\n\n(6)\n\n11\n\n\fWhere a0 is the mean atomic distance and T is the temperature. The density of bulk\namorphous Fe40Ni40P14B6 alloy can be determined to be 7.41\u00d710-3 kg/m3 by means of\nimmersed water method and the molar mass of the Fe40Ni40P14B6 alloy is 50.58\u00d710-3\nkg/mol. Thus the mean atomic distance a0 in the bulk amorphous Fe40Ni40P14B6 alloy can\no\n\nbe deduced to be 2.25 A . With Equ. 5 and Equ. 6, the average atomic jump distances l of\n\nthe amorphous Fe40Ni40P14B6 alloy at different consolidation temperature Ts after a hot\npressing time of 1 s can be estimated and are shown in Fig. 11.\nIt is shown in Fig. 11 that the viscosity \u03b7 of amorphous Fe40Ni40P14B6 alloy decreases\nrapidly from 109 Pa.s at T = 653 K to 106.5 Pa.s at T = 683 K. At T = 658 K, the viscosity of\nthe amorphous Fe40Ni40P14B6 alloy is higher and it is possible difficult for the amorphous\nFe40Ni40P14B6 alloy to produce the plastic flow. Thus many cracks occur in the\nsuperposition part of the two amorphous discs, where the stress is larger than that in the\nother parts of specimens. When T > 663 K, the viscosity \u03b7 decreases to ~108 Pa.s and it\nseems that the amorphous specimens have enough fluidity to produce the plastic flow. Thus\nthere are no cracks occurring in the specimens in the hot pressing process. At T = 675 K,\nthe viscosity decreases to ~107 Pa.s and completely fusion of the two amorphous alloy discs\no\n\nis achieved. At this temperature, the average atomic diffusion distance is ~ 12 A , which is\nmuch larger than the mean atomic distance a0 of the amorphous Fe40Ni40P14B6 alloy. So the\nconsolidation of the two amorphous alloy discs is fully possible. At T=681 K, the\namorphous specimens have a lower viscosity in the order of 106.5 Pa.s. However a vast\namount of crystallization occurs in the amorphous matrix at this temperature under our\nexperimental conditions. Although there are still 50% amorphous phase retained in the\n\n12\n\n\fspecimen, the crystallization results in the embrittlement of the specimen and the\nconsolidation of the amorphous specimens cannot be achieved.\nOnly when l > a0, the consolidation of the amorphous alloys could be achieved. From\nFig. 11, it is shown that that the average atomic diffusion distance of the amorphous\nFe40Ni40P14B6 alloy is not long enough to achieve the consolidation in a short time at a\nlower temperature in the supercooled liquid region. Our experimental results can be\nexplained well by these estimations. It is found that the viscosity of the amorphous\nFe40Ni40P14B6 alloy is low enough to achieve the consolidation in a short time only when\nthe consolidated temperature Ts get to the vicinity of 675 K.\nHowever, Equ.5 suggests that an effective value of the atomic jump distance can be\nachieved by increasing the consolidation time ts in the consolidation process of the\namorphous alloys. However in order to avoid the occurrence of crystallization, the\nconsolidation time ts should be less than the relaxation time tx of the amorphous alloys. The\nlower the consolidated temperature, the smaller the diffusion coefficient D. Quantitatively,\nsubstituting Equ. 4 and Equ. 6 into Equ. 5, the average atomic jump distance l can be\nwritten as:\nl = Q(T )\n\nts\ntx\n\n(7)\n\nHere Q(T) only depends on the temperature. The above equation shows that the\nconsolidation of the amorphous alloys performed at lower consolidated temperature Ts for a\nlonger isothermal time ts have no more advantages over that performed at higher\ntemperature for a shorter isothermal time. Furthermore, longer isothermal time will bring\nmore risks of introducing inhomogenous nucleation and growth.\n\n13\n\n\fThe results of the DSC scans show that about 10% amorphous phase in the compacts\nconsolidated at temperature ranging from 658 K to 675 K has crystallized and the transition\nfraction of the amorphous phase is almost invariable with temperature in that temperature\nrange. This fact suggests that crystallization is likely due to the growth of the\ninhomogenous quench-in nuclei in the starting amorphous alloys. These quench-in nuclei\nof larger size can growth at a lower temperature. The quantity of these nuclei is limited and\ntheir growth is also very slow at a low temperature so that the glass transition fraction is\ninsensitive to the consolidation temperature Ts in the range from 658 K to 675 K.\n\nV.\n\nConclusion\n\nExperiments exhibit that the consolidation of two bulk amorphous Fe40Ni40P14B6 alloy\ndiscs can be achieved via hot pressing for a short time in its supercooled liquid region.\nHowever when the consolidation temperature Ts is lower, the conjunction of two bulk\namorphous Fe40Ni40P14B6 alloy discs cannot be achieved in its supercooled liquid region.\nOnly when Ts get to the vicinity of 675 K, two amorphous Fe40Ni40P14B6 alloy discs have\nlow viscosity enough to be fully fused together in a short time under the pressure of ~1.2\nGPa. By further increasing the consolidation temperature Ts, plenty of crystallization will\noccur which will result in the embrittlement of the amorphous alloy.\nThe compacts consolidated at 675 K maintain ~ 90% amorphous phase. A small\namount of crystallization in the compacts is possible due to the growth of the\ninhomogenous quench-in nuclei in the starting amorphous alloys.\n\n14\n\n\fAcknowledgement\n\nI am grateful to Prof. H.
