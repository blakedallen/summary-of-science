GRBs are normally classified into two groups: the long-duration bursts\n(T90 > 2 s) and short ones (T90 < 2 s) (Kouveliotou et al. 1993), where T90 is defined as the\ntime interval in which the integrated photon counts increase from 5% to 95% of the total\ncounts. Several nearby long GRBs were observed to be firmly associated with core-collapse\nsupernovae (SNe), and meanwhile the \"collapsar\" model of massive star explosions leading\nto long GRBs has been well developed (Woosley & Bloom 2006). On the other hand, short\nGRBs are hypothesized to be formed by the coalescence of binary compact stars, and hence\nwith no SN connection (Nakar 2007). The prompt light curve of GRB 060614 as detected by\nthe Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) instrument displayed an initial short spike lasting for\n\u223c 4 s followed by an extended component lasting for \u223c 100 s, the latter being softer than the\nformer in energy. This is a long burst by the above definition. The measured redshift of its\nhost galaxy is as low as 0.125 (Price et al. 2006). However, despite its promising proximity,\nsurprisingly no SN was observed to accompany the GRB down to very deep detection limits\n(Della Valle et al. 2006a; Fynbo et al. 2006; Gal-Yam et al. 2006).\nVarious solutions have been proposed for the missing-SN puzzle of GRB 060614: First,\nthe GRB perhaps did not take place at z = 0.125 at all, but at much higher redshift so\nthat its associated SN was below the detection limit. Cobb et al. (2006) claimed that the\nproximity of the GRB line of sight to the z = 0.125 galaxy was a chance coincidence; however\nCampisi & Li (2008) found that the chance coincidence probability is less than 0.02%, thus\nruling out the chance coincidence assumption with high confidence. Alternatively, the GRB\ncould be produced with a very faint core-collapse SN (Tominaga et al. 2007; Fryer et al.\n2007), similar to the ones described by Turatto et al. (1998), Pastorello et al. (2004, 2007)\nand Valenti et al. (2009). Finally, this long GRB was not a consequence of the core-collapse\nof a massive star, and hence a novel mechanism is needed. For example, King et al. (2007a)\nsuggested that the merger of a massive white dwarf with a neutron star can make a longduration GRB.\nRecently, Lu et al. (2008) proposed a new mechanism to produce GRBs, namely the\ntidal disruption of a star by an intermediate mass black hole (IMBH). In this scenario, both\nthe long duration and the lack of an associated SN, as observed in GRB 060614, are naturally\nexpected. Furthermore, the model can well explain a probable 9-s periodicity found in the\nprompt BAT light curve of GRB 060614 between 7 and 50 s. Such a substructure seems\ndifficult to fit into either the collapsar scenario or compact star mergers. It is thus natural\nto investigate if GRB 060614 is just the first of this new class of GRBs, which is the purpose\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nof this paper.\nWe focus on the periodic substructure in the prompt light curve of a burst, since for\nmost GRBs it is impossible to tell if an SN is associated or not, due to their high redshifts. A\ngeneral picture of the tidal disruption model is given in Section 2, where important physical\nquantities are defined. The selection criteria, and the selected GRB 060614-like events in\nthe Swift samples, are described in Section 3. We do statistical studies on these bursts,\nand combine the statistical results with the model to give predictions in Section 4. Our\nconclusion and discussions are given in Section 5.\n\n2.\n\nThe Tidal Disruption Model for gamma-ray bursts\n2.1.\n\nThe model description\n\nTidal disruption of a star by an IMBH is analogous to the case for a supermassive\nblack hole. A star, which happened to be close enough to the black hole, was distorted and\nsquashed into a pancake by the strong tidal forces of the black hole. Once the star is tidally\ndisrupted by the black hole, the squashed debris finally falls into the black hole's horizon,\nforming a transient accretion disk around the black hole. During the early high accretion\nrate stage (near the Eddington rate), the inner region of the disk should be dominated by\nradiation pressure. In this case, the disk within the spherization radius Rsp is thermally\nunstable (Shakura & Sunyaev 1973), and the material in this inner region is likely broken\ninto many blobs. When the blobs are dragged into the black hole, the seed magnetic field\nanchored in the blobs can be amplified, forming a strong and ordered poloidal field, which\nin turn threads the black hole with a mass-flowing ring in the inner region of the disk and\nextracts a large amount of rotational energy, creating two counter-moving jets along the\nrotation axis of the black hole (Blandford & Znajek 1977). As in the conventional GRB\nmodel, each jet pointed toward the observer, produces one mini-burst lasting over a blob's\nfree-falling timescale (Lu et al. 2008). Consequently, many mini-bursts should be produced\nfor the tidal disruption event. Assuming that the in-falling process of the blobs into the\nblack hole is neither uniform nor completely unsystematic, they may fall in groups quasiperiodically and this behavior should be modulated by the Keplerian timescale, forming a\nperiodic sub-burst. All of these mini-bursts in the sub-burst add together to form a GRB, and\nthe duration of the GRB is determined by the time when all the blobs with the spherization\nradius are removed and fall into the black hole at the marginally stable radius. Note that the\nblobs in each group randomly fall into the black hole, so small dispersion between sub-bursts'\ndurations may exist.This model can reasonably explain all the observed basic features of the\nunusual GRB 060614, including the duration, the total energy, the periodic substructure,\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nand most importantly, the absence of SN link (Lu et al. 2008). The general picture of the\ntidal disruption model for such a GRB is plotted in Figure 1.\nFor convenience, we introduce the following dimensionless quantities throughout this\npaper:\n\u1e40\nMbh\n, \u1e41 =\nM5 = 5\n,\n10 M\u2299\n\u03b7 \u1e40Edd\n\u22121\nwhere \u1e40Edd = 3 \u00d7 10\u22122\u03b70.1\nM5 M\u2299 yr\u22121 is the Eddington accretion rate, \u03b7 is the energy\nconversion factor and \u03b70.1 = \u03b7/0.1. Subsequently, the key physical parameters related to the\ntidal disruption model derived by Lu et al. (2008) are briefly described.\n\n2.2.\n\nThe three timescales and one relation\n\nAccording to Lu et al. (2008), there are three useful timescales related to explain the\nobservations of GRB 060614: the mini-burst duration, Tpulse , the sub-burst period, Tk , and\nthe duration of the whole GRB, T90 . For instance, the three timescales are marked in the\nprompt light curve of GRB 060614 in Figure 2. They can be calculated by\nTpulse \u2243 3M5 s ,\n\n(1)\n\n3/2\nTk \u2243 50r\u0302ms\nM5 s,\n\u22121 3/2\nT90 \u2243 50\u03b1 r\u0302ms M5\n\n(2)\ns,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03b1 is the viscous parameter, 0 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 1, and r\u0302ms is the dimensionless radius of the\nmarginally stable circular orbit around a non-spinning in units of 6GM/c2 , i.e., r\u0302ms = 1.\nFrom Equations (2) and (3), we can obtain a linear relation between the duration of the\nbursts and the period of the substructure\nTk = \u03b1T90 .\n\n(4)\n\nEquation (4) shows that the slope of the linear relation corresponds to the viscous parameter\nof the disk. This relation could be very useful for the classification of the GRBs.\nNevertheless, the viscous parameter, \u03b1, is uncertain, which is considered to be related\nto the structure and physical properties of the disk, especially the magnetic fields of the disk;\nrecent numerical studies of the magnetorotational instability viscosity mechanism (Balbus\n& Hawley 1991) have shown that the value of the viscosity parameter depends upon the\nmagnetism of the disk and sufficiently strong magnetic fields in the disk are necessary for a\nlarge viscosity parameter (e.g., \u03b1 > 1; Pessah et al. 2007). Note that the disk considered\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nhere is formed through the black hole gulping a star, indicating that the disruption of a\ndifferent star by black holes will give a different disk, then the different viscosity of the\ndisk. To apply Equation (4) to certain GRBs, different values of \u03b1 indicate different GRB\nsubclasses, depending on the progenitors of the bursts.\n\n2.3.\n\nThe energy for a GRB\n\nThe tidal disruption model (Lu et al. 2008) can predict the isotropic energy of a GRB,\nEiso , given the beaming factor of \u0393,\nEiso \u2243 Etot \u00d7 \u0393,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere 10 \u2264 \u0393 \u2264 1000, and Etot is the total energy of a GRB, which is from the rotational\nenergy of black holes extracted by the BZ process (Blandford & Znajek 1977),\n\u0014\n\u0015\n(2.52\u1e41)7/64 \u2212 1\n51 \u22121\nEtot \u2243 2.46 \u00d7 10 \u03b1 M5\nA2 f (A)Ntot erg,\n(6)\n2.52\u1e41 \u2212 1\nwhere Ntot is the total number of mini-bursts in the whole GRB, A is the dimensionless\nangular momentum of the black hole, and f (A) = 2/3 for A \u2192 0 and f (A) = \u03c0 \u2212 2 for\nA \u2192 1 (Lee et al. 2000)).\nSubstituting Equation (4) into Equation (6) to eliminate the viscous parameter \u03b1, the\nexpression of Eiso can be rewritten as\n\u0014\n\u0015\n7/64\n\u22121\n51 T90 (2.52\u1e41)\nEiso \u2243 2.46 \u00d7 10\n\u0393M5 A2 f (A)Ntot erg .\n(7)\nTk\n2.52\u1e41 \u2212 1\nGiven A2 f (A) = 0.02 and \u1e41 = 1, Lu et al. (2008) consistently explained the properties of\nGRB 060614. Since the purpose of this work is searching for GRBs similar to GRB 060614\nand then analyzing these bursts' properties, it is reasonable to assume that the adoption of\nA2 f (A) = 0.02 and \u1e41 = 1 is still suitable. Therefore, we use these values to other bursts\nhereafter in this paper. Note that Eiso is the most important physical quantity for using\nGRBs to investigate cosmology, such as the relation of Amati et al. (2002). Equation(7)\nshows that the isotropic energy only depends on the prompt gamma-ray emission light curve\nof a burst and the beaming factor of each individual burst, if the tidal disruption model for\nGRB 060614 can be generalized to other bursts similar to GRB 060614. This is in favor of\nEiso of each burst as a calibrated candle to study cosmology. We will discuss this later.\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\n3.\n\nSearching for gamma-ray bursts similar to GRB060614\n3.1.\n\nThe criteria and Samples\n\nAssuming that the tidal disruption model for GRB 060614 can be generalized to investigate other gamma-ray bursts similar to GRB 060614, called GRB 060614-type bursts,\nwe propose three criteria to identify this new class of bursts: (1) the bursts must be longduration bursts (T90 > 2 s) without SN association; (2) the bursts should have an obvious\nperiodic substructure (sub-burst) in the prompt light curves of the bursts, and the periodic\nsubstructure is composed of more than three mini-bursts; and (3) the burst should satisfy\nthe relation indicated by the tidal disruption model: Tk = \u03b1T90 . The three criteria must be\nall satisfied for each burst identified.\nAccording to the above criteria, we select the samples among the 393 GRBs discovered\nby the Swift BAT before 2008 October 1. There are 330 long-duration bursts with accurately\nmeasured T90 . For these 393 GRBs, we first exclude two GRBs with established SN associations: GRB060218 (Pian et al. 2006) and GRB050525A (Della Valle et al. 2006b). From the\nrest 328 GRBs, we identified 24 new bursts. The prompt light curve of GRB 060614 is shown\nin Figure 2 and the light curves of the newly selected 24 samples are shown in Figure 3. All\nof them are from a public online database 1 . Tables 1 and 2 list all the physical quantities\nrelated to the 25 samples (including GRB 060614), where Table 1 corresponds to 7 samples\nwith measured redshifts, and Table 2 is for the rest 18 samples with unknown redshifts. The\ndata are derived by combining the observations and the model. The details are summarized\nas follows.\n\n3.2.\n\nThe observed quantities\n\n(1) From a public online database 2 , we can obtain the duration (T90 ) of the 25 GRB 060614type bursts, and the redshifts (z obs ) of 7 GRB 060614-type bursts including GRB 060614\nitself.\n(2) Based on the appearance of the observed light curves of the bursts shown in Figures\n2 and 3, we extract the number, Nsub , and the duration, Tk , of the sub-bursts. First our\nattempt of power density spectrum (PDS) analysis failed in this process. Taking GRB 070223\nas an example, whose light curve (see Figure 3) shows obvious quasi-periodic substructures,\n1\n\nhttp://grb.physics.unlv.edu/ xrt/xrtweb/web/sum.html\n\n2\n\nhttp://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nwe present its PDS (the analysis is based on a 64 ms BAT light curve data, 15-350 keV\nand T\u221220 s to T+110 s ) in Figure 4. No significant signal was found in the PDS. We then\npropose two explanations for this failure. First, the extreme complexity of the light curves\nand the sensitive dependence of PDS on the noise properties sometimes prevent the PDS\nanalysis from detecting the obvious structures in the light curves; second, as we said in\nSection 2, the scatter of sub-bursts' durations may lower the detection significance of the\nsub-burst structure in the PDS. Consequently, we obtain the results of sub-bursts by a\nvisual inspection method. In the following, we describe the detailed process of identifying\nsub-bursts and estimating their durations from the light curves of the 25 GRB 060614-type\nbursts by the visual inspection method. We want to stress two important features of the\nGRB 060614-type bursts' light curves that will be taken as our selection priors: (1) pulses\nin the light curves tend to gather into several groups which are considered as candidates\nfor sub-bursts; and (2) quasi-periodic substructures exist in the light curves. The 25 light\ncurves are consequently classified into three cases (details are presented in Tables 1 and\n2). Case I (2/25): all of the candidates for sub-bursts are separated by quiescent periods\n(since our analysis is based on existing light curves whose backgrounds have been taken\nout, we define quiescent period here as the period during which no significant peak can\nbe recognized visually). Case II (19/25): all of the candidates for sub-bursts join together.\nCase III (4/25): some of the candidates for sub-bursts are separated by quiescent periods and\nothers join together. For Case I, Nsub is easily obtained. We then take the average value of\nsub-bursts' durations as Tk . For Case II, we first find out the highest peak in each sub-burst\ncandidate, and then find out the minimum of the valley between the two adjacent highest\npeaks. These valleys, together with the beginning of the first sub-burst candidate and the\nend of the last sub-burst candidate, are taken as the candidates for the beginning or end\nof these candidate sub-bursts, whose corresponding times are labeled as ti (i = 1 . . . n + 1),\nwhere n is the number of candidate sub-bursts. Since the real sub-bursts should satisfy the\nquasi-periodic property requirement, the values of all ti+1 \u2212 ti should be approximately the\nsame. We calculate T = hti+1 \u2212 ti i as the first estimate to Tk . For each sub-burst candidate,\nif ti+1 \u2212ti < 0.5T or ti+1 \u2212ti > 1.5T , we reject the sub-burst candidate corresponding to ti+1 ,\nand repeat the above procedure with the remaining n \u2212 1 candidates until all the candidates\nsatisfy the criterion. Finally, we obtain Nsub and take the value of T = hti+1 \u2212 ti i as Tk . For\nCase III, some sub-bursts could be first identified similar to Case I, and we take the average\nvalue of these sub-bursts' durations T as the first estimate to Tk , and then identify other\nsub-bursts through the same procedure for Case II. Finally we also take the average value of\nthe durations of these sub-bursts as Tk in Case III. We note that in all the cases, we cannot\ngive the exact error of Tk introduced by the visual inspection method.\n(3) Following the peak-finding algorithm proposed by Li & Fenimore (1996), we obtain\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nthe total number of mini-bursts, Ntot , and the corresponding timescale of Tpulse . We use a\nlinear function B(t) to fit the burst background between the pre-burst and post-burst regions,\nwhere t is the time. The whole burst region is divided into many count bins. Corresponding\nto the mini-burst time, tpulse , there is a peak bin with a count of Cp . This peak bin is assumed\nas having more counts than the neighboring bins around it. The condition for Cp is satisfied\nif\np\nCp \u2212 C1,2 \u2265 Nvar Cp ,\n(8)\n\nwhere Nvar is a constant parameter, and Nvar = 5, C1 and C2 are the counts in two of the\nneighboring bins at t1 and t2 , where t1 < tp < t2 (see (Li & Fenimore 1996) for details of\nthe peak-finding algorithm). Searching through the whole burst light curve, all peaks can\nbe found. Assuming that each peak count corresponds to a mini-burst, the total mini-burst\nnumber, Ntot , in each GRB can be determined immediately. Combining the assumption of\nthe tidal disruption model, we can get\nTpulse =\n\nNsub\nTk ,\nNtot\n\n(9)\n\nwhere Tk , Nsub and Ntot are derived as in the above discussion.\nKB08\n(4) The isotropic energy for seven known redshift bursts, Eiso\n, are from Kocevski & Butler\n(2008). This will be used as evidence to check the tidal disruption model by comparing with\nthe model predictions.\n\n3.3.\n\nThe model quantities\n\nIn this subsection, we address and generalize the physical quantities predicted by the\ntidal disruption model for the GRB 060614 (Lu et al. 2008), such as, the masses of black\nholes, the isotropic energy, and the redshifts related to all 25 samples.\n(1) The existence of IMBHs is still hotly debated and for which astronomers are still\nsearching for direct evidence (Heger & Woosley 2002; Portegies Zwart et al. 2004; Miller & Hamilton\n2002; Gebhardt et al. 2005). Recent theoretical work, however, has given their possible density and occurring rate in the Milky Way. If these predictions are confirmed by observations,\nthere could be 1,000-10,000 IMBHs in our native Galaxy. One way to estimate the masses of\nIMBHs is the tidal disruption model for GRBs. From Equation (2), we find that the periodic\ntimescale, Tk , is linearly related to the masses of black holes assuming r\u0302ms = 1 (Lu et al.\n2008). Rewriting Equation (2), we have\nM5 \u2243 0.02Tk .\n\n(10)\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nSubstituting Tk estimated according to the burst observations (in Subsection 3.2) into Equation (10), we can immediately obtain M5 for the 25 samples, which are listed in Tables 1 and\n2. The results show that the masses of the black holes range from 5 \u00d7 103 M\u2299 to 9 \u00d7 104M\u2299 .\nThese are the typical masses of IMBHs discussed by Miller & Hamilton (2002). The distribution of M5 for the 25 GRB 060614-type bursts is plotted in the left panel of Figure\n5.\n(2)Adopting A2 f (A) = 0.02, \u1e41 = 1(see Section 2 for the definition of A2 f (A) and\n\u1e41), and substituting M5 , T90 and Tk into Equation (7), we can immediately calculate the\npre\nisotropic energy, Eiso\nas long as we know the beaming factors for each GRB. Since we have\npre\nnot obtained the beaming factors for all the 25 samples, for rough estimation of Eiso\n, we\nuniformly take the average value of 500 for \u0393, whose observational range is 10 \u2264 \u0393 \u2264 1000,\nas the beaming factor for all the 25 samples. The results are listed in Tables 1 and 2. The\npre\nfor the 25 samples.\nmiddle panel of Figure 5 plots the distribution of Eiso\n(3) The redshifts for the 25 samples can also be predicted. It is known that the relation\nbetween the isotropic energy, Eiso , and the fluence, F\u03b3 , of GRBs, satisfies\nEiso = 4\u03c0d2L F\u03b3 ,\n\n(11)\n\nwhere dL is the distance between a GRB and the observer, which can be calculated by\n(Carroll et al. 1992)\nZ\n1+z z\ndL =\n[(1 + x)2 (1 + x\u03a9M ) \u2212 x(2 + x)\u03a9\u039b ]\u22121/2 dx,\n(12)\nH0 0\nwhere x is an integral variable for the redshift; \u03a9M , \u03a9\u039b and H0 are the cosmological constant\nKB08\nparameters and Hubble constant, respectively. To compare with the Eiso\n, we adopt \u039bCDM\n\u22121\n\u22121\ncosmology, that is: \u03a9M = 0.3 , \u03a9\u039b = 0.7 and H0 = 71kms Mpc . Combining Equations\n(11) and (12), we can numerically calculate the redshift, z. The distribution of the predicted\nredshifts for 25 samples is plotted in the right panel of Figure 5.\n\n4.\n\nStatistical relations and predictions\n\nBased on observations and our theoretical model, Subsections 2.2 and 2.3 have considered the physical quantities related to the 25 GRB 060614-type bursts. The statistical\nanalysis and the predictions based on these quantities will be addressed in detail.\nIt is important to examine if the tidal disruption model, which is successful for the case\nof GRB 060614 (Lu et al. 2008), can be generalized to explain the other 24 bursts selected\npre\nBK08\nin this paper. We first consider the relation between Eiso\nand Eiso\nfor the seven known\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\npre\nBK08\nredshift samples. We plot the data of Eiso\nand Eiso\nin Figure 6. Using the least-squares\nfitting, we find a linear relation\npre\nKB08\nlog(Eiso\n) = (0.997 \u00b1 0.03) log(Eiso\n),\n\nwhere the adjusted R-square value is \u223c 0.999. This indicates that the isotropic energy\npredicted by the model agrees well with those given by the observations (Kocevski & Butler\n2008). We thus believe that the tidal disruption model can be successfully generalized to\nstudy the properties of the other GRB 060614-type bursts. More observed isotropic energy\nfor the rest 18 unknown redshift GRB 060614-type bursts can be used to check such relation\nin the future if their host galaxy's redshifts can be measured.\nIt is interesting to note that the isotropic energy of GRBs is one of the best rulers to\npre\nmeasure the expansion of the universe (Amati et al. 2002). Since Eiso\npredicted by the tidal\ndisruption model is only related to T90 and Tk , we can thus study cosmology using only the\nprompt light curves of the bursts and the redshifts of their host galaxies.\nWe then plot the data of z obs and z pre for the seven known redshift samples in Figure\n7. The relation fitted by the least-squares method follows:\nz obs = (1.10 \u00b1 0.12)z pre ,\nwhere the adjusted R-square is 0.93. This again indicates that the redshifts predicted agree\nwell with those observed, which further prove that the tidal disruption model is correct\nfor the new class of bursts, such as GRB 060614-type bursts discussed in this paper. The\npredictions of the 18 unknown redshift GRB 060614-type bursts will be tested by the further\nobservations.\npre\nKB08\nThe relations of both Eiso\n\u2212 Eiso\nand z pre \u2212 z obs argue that the tidal disruption model\ncan work well for the 25 new class bursts. We plot the data of Tk and T90 in Figure 8. We find\ninterestingly that the relation between Tk and T90 for the 25 samples can be well fitted by\ntwo linear curves with different slopes: four of the samples , i.e., GRB060210, GRB060614,\nGRB080602, and GRB080503, follow the linear relation\n\nTk = (0.08 \u00b1 0.003) T90 ,\n\n(13)\n\nand the rest 21 of the samples follow\nTk = (0.27 \u00b1 0.013) T90 ,\n\n(14)\n\nrespectively. The slope of the former curve is about 0.08, and the later one is 0.27.\nComparing with Equations (13) and (14) with Equation (4), we get two values of viscous\nparameters, \u03b11 = 0.08 and \u03b12 = 0.27, respectively. Both of them fall well in the typical\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nrange of \u03b1 \u223c 0.1-0.4 inferred from observations of unsteady accretion disks, such as in the\noutbursts of dwarf novae and X-ray transients (King et al. 2007b). It is known that the\nviscous parameter depends on the detailed structure and the magnetic field of the disk,\nbecause more strongly magnetized allows more efficient angular momentum transfer in the\ndisk, and thus results in larger values of \u03b1 (Pessah et al. 2007). Here in our model the\ntransient disk is formed by the IMBHs disrupting stars, thus different structure and magnetic\nfield of the disk will be produced by the disruptions of different type of stars. If white\ndwarfs, instead of regular stars, are tidally disrupted by black holes (Frolov et al. 1994;\nFryer et al. 1999; Rosswog et al. 2009), much more strongly magnetized disk with higher\nviscous parameter can be produced, because during the contraction process which forms the\nwhite dwarf, magnetic fields are significantly amplified due to magnetic flux conservation\n(Tout et al. 2004). As a matter of fact, white dwarfs can only be tidally disrupted by IMBHs,\nbecause they will simply fall into supermassive black holes without being tidally disrupted,\ndue to their much smaller sizes than regular stars. Similarly, neutron stars, though have\nmuch higher surface magnetic fields than those of white dwarfs, will fall into IMBHs directly\nwithout being tidally disrupted. We thus postulate that the linear relations between Tk and\nT90 given in Equations (13) and (14) divide 25 GRB 060614-type bursts into two subclasses:\n4 of them are Type I, corresponding to IMBHs gulping to solar-type stars, and the rest 21\nbursts are Type II, which are produced by the IMBHs disrupting white dwarfs, respectively.\nThe ratio of Type I to Type II is about 1:5, suggesting that white dwarfs are much more\nabundant than solar-type stars around IMBHs; this possibility is discussed in the end.\n\n5.\n\nDiscussion and conclusion\n\nWe have identified a new class of GRBs, called GRB 060614-type bursts, which is produced by IMBHs tidally disrupting stars. To select out these GRB 060614-types, we have\nused criteria based on the observation features of GRB 060614 and our tidal disruption model,\nand searched through all the GRBs discovered by Swift BAT until 2008 October 1.\n(1) We found 25 GRB 060614-type bursts from the 328 Swift GRBs with accurately measured durations and without SN association; 4 bursts (GRB060210, GRB060614, GRB080602,\nand GRB080503) are Type I, and the rest 21 bursts are Type II. These new GRB 060614-type\nbursts make 6% of the total Swift GRBs, composed of 1% Type I and 5% Type II.\n(2) We derive the distributions of the IMBH's masses of the 25 bursts, as well as the\nisotropic energies and redshifts for the 18 bursts with unknown redshifts, predicted by the\ntidal disruption model. The statistical studies show that the masses of the IMBHs are from\n5 \u00d7 103 M\u2299 to 9 \u00d7 104 M\u2299 (in the left panel of Figure 5), the isotropic energies predicted are\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nwell consistent with those given by Kocevski & Butler (2008), and the redshifts predicted\nare also agreed well with observations. These results confirm the tidal disruption model, and\nmay possibly provide a new standard candle to study the cosmology.\n(3) We obtain statistically that the relation between the substructure period and the\nduration of the 25 GRB 060614-type bursts is fitted by two linear curves with slopes (viscous\nparameters of their disks) of 0.08 and 0.27, respectively. This indicates that 25 GRB 060614type bursts are composed of 2 subtypes called Type I and Type II, corresponding to two\ndifferent progenitors for their productions through the tidal disruption. We postulate that\nthe progenitors for 4 Type I bursts are most likely solar-type stars, and those for the 21\nType II bursts are probably white dwarfs.\nFinally, we discuss the event rate ratio between Type I and Type II bursts. Gebhardt\net al.(2005) found evidence for an IMBH of mass of about 2 \u00d7 104 M\u2299 , residing in a globular\ncluster G1, which makes globular cluster as the most popular candidate to probe IMBHs. In\nyoung star clusters, high-mass stars segregate through energy equipartition; as a result, the\nheavier stars sink to the center while the lighter stars move to the outer halo. This process\nis called \"mass segregation\" (Spitzer 1969, 1987). Through dynamical friction, most massive\nstars tend to concentrate toward the center and drive the system to core collapse (G\u00fcrkan\net al. 2004). As shown in a number of numerical studies (e.g., Portegies Zwart et al. 2004;\nG\u00fcrkan et al. 2004), very high initial central densities might lead to a rapid core collapse\nand segregation of massive stars, and trigger a runaway merger of massive stars, leading to\nthe formation of an IMBH. It is naturally suggested that the less massive stars, not involved\nin the runaway process but were also migrating toward the clusters' centers, may eventually\nend as white dwarfs, neutron stars or black holes. Neutron stars and black holes, driven\nby dynamical frictions, will also migrate toward the center , due to their larger masses, so\nonly white dwarfs (and some low mass stars) will remain (Heyl 2008; Heyl & Penrice 2009).\nOn the other hand, due to the mass segregation mentioned above, those much less massive\nstars, such as the solar-type stars, may migrate there much later on the average. Therefore\nin the vicinity of IMBHs in centers of star clusters, the space density of white dwarfs should\nbe much higher than that of solar-type stars, explaining naturally the much higher event\nrate of Type II bursts discussed above. We thus predict that the central region of the G1\ncluster harboring an IMBH should contain many more white dwarfs than solar-type stars.\nHowever, without further extensive studies, which are beyond the scope of this present work,\nwe cannot predict or explain quantitatively the suggested 5:1 ratio between white dwarfs and\nsolar-type stars.\nWe thank J.S.
