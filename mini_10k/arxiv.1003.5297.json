The porosity in turn depends on the deformation and compaction state and can be calculated from the compaction curves resulting from the\nproper compaction modelling [Audet and Fowler,\n1992]. Furthmore, compaction is also related to overpressuring, mineral deposition, hydrocarbon generation and oil migration in reservoir. Thus the correct modelling of compaction is both of scientific\nimportance as well as industrial interest. However,\ndue to the nonlinear feature in the compaction process and difficulty in formulating the accurate and\nrealistic rheological relationship in sediments and\nrocks, most of existing models use simplified rheology such as poroelastic, purely viscous or viscoelastic\nrelations [Rutter, 1976; Wangen, 1992; Holzbercher,\n1998; Revil, 1999; Yang,2000]. The rheological properties of realistic granular sediments are usually viscoelastic or viscoplastic as implied by experiments.\n\n2\n\nMATHEMATICAL MODEL\n\nThe fundamental model of compaction and pressure\nsolution is essentially similar to the model of soil consolidation process. The solid sediments act as a compressible porous matrix, so mass conservation of pore\nfluid together with Darcy's law leads to an equation\nof the general type. Based on earlier work by Audet and Fowler [1992], Revil[1999] and Yang[2000],\nwe can write down the poro-visco-plastic compaction\nmodel of Voigt type. In the one-dimensional case, we\nhave the following governing equations\n\n1\n\n\u2202\n\u2202(1 \u2212 \u03c6)\n+\n[(1 \u2212 \u03c6)us ] = 0,\n\u2202t\n\u2202z\n\n(1)\n\n\u2202\u03c6 \u2202(\u03c6ul )\n+\n= 0,\n\u2202t\n\u2202z\n\n(2)\n\n\f\u03c6(ul \u2212 us ) = \u2212\n\nk(\u03c6) \u2202p\n[\n+ \u03c1l g],\n\u03bc \u2202z\n\nFor a typical sedimentation rate \u1e41s , the corresponding typical time scale is d/\u1e41s where the typical\nlength scale d can be defined as\n\n(3)\n\n\u2202pe \u2202p\n\u2212\n\u2212 \u03c1g = 0, \u03c1 = \u03c1s (1 \u2212 \u03c6) + \u03c1l \u03c6, (4)\n\u2202z\n\u2202z\nwhere \u03c6 is porosity. ul and us are the velocities of\nfluid and solid matrix, respectively. k and \u03bc are the\nmatrix permeability and the liquid viscosity, \u03c1l and\n\u03c1s are the densities of fluid and solid matrix, pe is the\neffective pressure, pl is the pore pressure, and g is the\ngravitational acceleration. G = 1 + 4\u03b70/3\u03be0 is a constant describing the material properties with \u03b70 and\n\u03be0 being the shear modulus and bulk viscosity [Bird\net al, 1977]. The first two equations are the conservation of mass for the solid phase and liquid phase,\nrespectively. The third equation is the Darcy's law in\n1-D form and the last equation is actually the force\nbalance in a simplified form whose detailed derivation can be found in [Fowler and Yang, 1998]. Combining equation (3) and (4), we have\n\u2212G\n\n\u03c6(ul \u2212 us ) =\n\nd={\n\n\u03be \u1e41s G 1/2\n} ,\n(\u03c1s \u2212 \u03c1l )g\n\n(7)\n\nso that the dimensionless pressure p = Gpe /(\u03c1s \u2212\n\u03c1l )gd = O(1). Meanwhile, we scale z with d, us\nwith \u1e41s , time t with d/\u1e41s , permeability k with k0 .\nBy writing k(\u03c6) = k0 k \u2217 , z = dz \u2217 , ..., and dropping\nthe asterisks, we thus have\n\u2212\n\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u2202\n+\n[(1 \u2212 \u03c6)us ] = 0,\n\u2202t\n\u2202z\n\n\u2202\u03c6 \u2202(\u03c6ul )\n+\n= 0,\n\u2202t\n\u2202z\n\u2202p\n\u03c6(ul \u2212 us ) = \u03bbk(\u03c6)[\u2212\n\u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03c6)],\n\u2202z\nZ t\n\u2202us\n\u2202us\np=\u2212\n\u2212\u039e\ndt\n\u2202z\n0 \u2202z\n\n\u2202pe\nk(\u03c6)\n[\u2212G\n\u2212 (\u03c1s \u2212 \u03c1l )(1 \u2212 \u03c6)g], (5)\n\u03bc\n\u2202z\n\n(8)\n(9)\n(10)\n(11)\n\nwhere\n\nIn writing the above equations, we have used an upward coordinate z originating from z = 0, which\ncorresponds to the bottom of the sedimentary column, so that the ocean floor z = h(t) moves as compaction proceeds. We use such a coordinate system\nbecause it simplifies the analytical solution procedure and also in keeping with the similar lines of\nearlier work in this area [Audet and Fowler, 1992;\nYang, 2000]. However, the conventional depth coordinate is simply z \u2212 h(t), thus the transformation\nshall be straightforward once the basin thickness h(t)\nis known. As we shall see in the later sections, we\nprovide an explicit formula for h(t) as a very good\napproximation.\nIn addition, a rheological compactional relationship derived from experimental data [Revil, 1999] is\nneeded to complete this model in the form\nZ t\n\u2202us\n\u2202us\n\u2212E\ndt,\n(6)\npe = \u2212\u03be\n\u2202z\n0 \u2202z\n\n\u03bb=\n\nEG\nk0 (\u03c1s \u2212 \u03c1l )g\n, \u039e=\n.\n\u03bc\u1e41s\n(\u03c1s \u2212 \u03c1l )gd\n\n(12)\n\nAdding (8) and (9) together and integrating from\nthe bottom, we have\nus = \u2212\u03c6(ul \u2212 us ),\nwhere u = \u03c6(ul \u2212us ) is the Darcy flow velocity.\nwe have\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u2202\n=\n[(1 \u2212 \u03c6)us ],\n\u2202t\n\u2202z\n\u03c6\n\u2202p\nus = \u03bb( )m [\u2212\n\u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03c6)].\n\u03c60\n\u2202z\nZ t\n\u2202us\n\u2202us\n\u2212\u039e\ndt,\np=\u2212\n\u2202z\n0 \u2202z\n\n(13)\nNow,\n(14)\n(15)\n(16)\n\nwhere we have used the nonlinear constitutive relation for permeability k(\u03c6) of typical form [Smith,\nwhere E is the elastic modulus and \u03be is the viscosity 1971]\n\u03c6\nmodulus.

We can see that the\nmain parameters \u03bb and \u039e, which govern the evolution of the fluid flow and porosity in sedimentary\nbasins, are the ratios of permeability to sedimentation rate and material modulus to the typical pressure scale. As \u03bb is essentially controlled by the hydraulic conductivity, so it becomes the dominant parameter controlling the whole compaction and pressure solution processes.\n\n4\n\n\u22023\u03c6\n\u22022\u03c6\n\u2202\u03c6\n.\n= \u03bb\u039e 2 + \u03bb\n\u2202t\n\u2202z\n\u2202t\u2202z 2\n\nAs the \u039e \u226b 1 and \u03bb \u226a 1, we can use the approximation \u03c6t \u2248 \u03bb\u039e\u03c6zz so that we have\n\u2202\u03c6\n1 \u22022\u03c6\n\u22022\u03c6\n.\n= \u03bb\u039e 2 +\n\u2202t\n\u2202z\n\u039e \u2202t2\n\n(24)\n\nwith appropriate boundary conditions\n\u2202\u03c6\n(1 \u2212 \u03c60 )2\n\u2248\u2212\n, on z = 0,\n\u2202z\n\u039e\n\n(25)\n\n\u03c6 \u2192 \u03c60 , z \u2192 \u221e,\n\n(26)\n\nThis problem is in fact equivalent to the problem\nof hyperbolic heat conduction or non-Fourier heat\nequation which is well-documented in heat transfer\nand laser pulse modelling [Antaki, 1997].

In\nfact, \u03bb = 1 defines a transition between slow compaction (\u03bb \u226a 1) and fast compaction (\u03bb \u226b 1). The\ncase of \u03bb \u226a 1 corresponds to the situation where\nthe pore fluid pressure is nearly hydrostatic whereas\nthe opposite case corresponds to an overpressured\nsection in which the pore fluid pressure is quasilithostatic.

On the other\nhand, for the large \u03bb \u226b 1 case where sedimentation\nor loading is slow in high permeable sediments, the\ntravelling wave solution exists and the top surface\nmoves up with nearly constant velocity.\nCompared with the earlier work [Yang, 2000]\nusing the viscoelastic rheological relation, we see\nthat the there is no essential difference in the case\nsmall deformation (\u03bb \u226a 1). Boundary layer exists\nin both viscoelastic and poro-viscous-plastic cases\nalthough the slight difference is that the former\nviscoelastic case corresponds to the heat conduction\nwith a constant flux and a constant source term,\nwhile the latter poro-visco-plastic case is mainly a\nhyperbolic heat condution mechanism. The case\nof fast deformation and compaction (\u03bb \u226b 1) is\nmore complicated. Although both viscoelastic and\nporo-viscous-plastic cases have a transition at the\ndepth where \u03c6 \u2248 \u03c6\u2217 , however, the mechanisms\nabove and below the transition are very different.\nIn the viscoelastic case, the top region is essentially\nporoelastic while the lower region is almost purely\nviscous, while in the present poro-visco-plastic case,\nthe mechanism is a complicated combination of\nviscous-plastic mechanism and poro-elastic deformation process controlled by the proper balance\nof the parameters \u03bb and \u039e. Furthermore, in comparison with the earlier results, this work suggests\nthat Voigt-type poro-visco-plastic deformation\nhas much interesting characteristics due to its\ntime-dependence feature.\n\n(32)\n\nNow we can seek the traveling wave solution of the\nform \u03c6 = \u03c6(\u03b6) with \u03b6 = z \u2212 ct, so that we have\n(1 \u2212 \u03c6)(1 \u2212 \u03c6\u2217 ) = \u2212c\u03c6\u2032\u2032 + \u039e\u03c6\u2032\n\n(33)\n\nwhere \u03c6\u2032 = d\u03c6/d\u03b6. We can easily write the solution\nas\np\n[\u039e \u2212 \u039e + 4c(1 \u2212 \u03c6\u2217 )]\u03b6\n] (34)\n\u03c6 = 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03c60 ) exp[\n2c\nIn fact, the above solution is only valid for the top\npart when \u03c6 < \u03c6\u2217 . Using equation (6) and \u03c6 \u223c \u03c6\u2217\nas \u03b6 \u2192 \u2212\u221e, the travelling wave implies that\nc\u03c6 + (1 \u2212 \u03c6)us = c\u03c60 + (\u1e41s \u2212 c)(1 \u2212 \u03c60 ).\n\n(35)\n\nso that we have\nc \u2248 \u1e41s (\n\n1 \u2212 \u03c60\n1 \u2212 \u03c60\n), h(t) \u2248 \u1e41s (\nt,\n1 \u2212 \u03c6\u2217\n1 \u2212 \u03c6\u2217\n\n(36)\n\nwhich means the basin thickness increases linearly\nwith time.\n\n5\n\nNumerical Simulations\n\nIn order to check the accuracy of the above analysis,\nwe used a finite element method to solve the above\nequations (8)-(11).
