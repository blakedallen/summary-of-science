Presently commercial\nblue laser diodes are available, and lasers working in the blueviolet spectral region are realized for both pulsed and\ncontinuous wave operations. However, these significant\nachievements do not fully exploit the potential applicability\nof nitride compounds. Further progress can be expected due\nto low dimensional nitride devices like quantum dot lasers or\nsingle photon emitters utilising, for example, self-assembled\nGaN quantum dots in AlN or AlGaN matrix. The current\nstrong interest in such systems is motivated by their potential\nto achieve lasers with lower threshold currents and improved\ntemperature characteristics. Therefore, a better control of the\nproperties of such nitride based nanostructures is of\nsignificant practical interest.\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\nSoft-X-ray emission (SXE) and absorption (SXA)\nspectroscopies allow investigation of the electronic structure\nof the valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB),\nrespectively, with elemental specificity and large probing\ndepth up to 3000 \u00c5. In particular, the electronic structure of\nburied quantum dots, interfaces1 and even isolated impurities2\n(see further references in a review3 by Kotani and Shin) can\nbe accessed by these techniques.\nIn general, the SXE/SXA spectroscopies characterize the\nelectron partial density of states (PDOS) resolved in their\nelemental and orbital character, but averaged over the wave\nvectors k. For weakly correlated semiconductor systems,\nhowever, certain k-selectivity appears in resonant inelastic Xray scattering (RIXS) where the core electron is excited\nwithin a few eV above the absorption threshold.3 In this case\nthe absorption and emission events are coupled in a fast\ncoherent scattering process, in which the full momentum is\nconserved as\nqin - qout = ke + kh\nwhere qin and qout are wave vectors of the absorbed and\nemitted photons, and ke and kh are those of the conduction\nelectron and valence hole, respectively. Dependence of the\nresonant SXE spectra on the excitation energy hvex reflects\nthen the VB and CB dispersions E(k). The k-selectivity of\nRIXS has been demonstrated for a number of semiconductors\nsuch as Si and SiC, and even for the graphite semimetal.3,4,5\n\nSpectroscopic investigations of the GaN electronic structure\nare far from being exhaustive. In particular, its k-resolved\nstudies with conventional angle-resolved photoelectron\nspectroscopy (ARPES) are burdened by surface effects\nsensitive to the sample growth and surface preparation\nprocedures (see, e.g., Refs. 6 and 7). Moreover, small\nphotoelectron escape depth principally limits applications of\nthis technique to nanostructure systems such as GaN quantum\ndots buried in a matrix of other material. The soft-X-ray\nspectroscopies with their large probing depth and elemental\nspecificity are ideally suited for this purpose. Stagarescu et\nal.8 and Lawniczak-Jablonska et al.9 used the SXE and SXA\nspectroscopies to study, respectively, the occupied and\nunoccupied PDOS of GaN,. Eisebitt et al.10 found pronounced\nchanges in the N K-edge SXE spectral shape occuring near\nthe absorption threshold, which they interpreted in terms of\nmomentum conservation. However, a systematic study of\n\nGaN is a prototype nitride compound representative of a large\nfamily of binary and ternary group III nitrides, having a wide\nrange of optoelectronic device applications covering the\n\n1\n\n\fRIXS in GaN and its connection to the band structure is\npresently missing.\n\n375 380 385 390 395 400 405 410 415 420\n\nHere, we present a high-resolution SXE/SXA study on\nwurtzite GaN performed near the N K-edge. Compared to our\npilot study in Ref. 11, the present results are based on\nexperimental data obtained for a larger set of excitation\nenergies at higher resolution and varied scattering geometries,\nand receive extended theoretical analysis. We unambiguously\nidentify effects of momentum conservation in the RIXS\nprocess. The experimental results are supported by our stateof-the-art band structure calculations.\n\nh\u03bd (eV)\n\nexperiment\nx5\n\nII. EXPERIMENT\ntheory (no hole)\n\nWe have studied wurtzite GaN with the (0001) surface\norientation. The sample was a 30 \u03bcm thick GaN film grown\non a sapphire substrate using hydride vapour phase epitaxy in\nthe optimum growth window.12 High crystalline quality of the\nsample was confirmed by high resolution x-ray diffraction\nrocking curve and low temperature photoluminescence (LTPL) measurements. The FWHM values of the \u03c9- and 2\u03b8-\u03c9\nradial scans for the symmetric (002) and asymmetric (102),\n(104), and (114) reflections approached the best values\nreported for thick nitride films grown on foreign substrate,\nand indicate relatively low mosaicity without domain\nformation achieved at this thickness. The LT-PL spectrum of\nthe sample shows well resolved exciton-related peaks in the\nnear band edge region with FWHM less than 2 meV,\nconfirming the high crystalline and optical quality of the film.\n\ntheory (core hole)\n\nThe SXE/SXA experimental data were taken near the N Kedge (1s core level) at ~400 eV. The experiments were\nperformed at MAX-lab, Sweden, at the undulator beamline\nI511-3 equipped with an SX-700 type plane grating\nmonochromator,13 and a high-resolution Rowland-mount\ngrazing incidence SXE spectrometer.14 The incident radiation\nhad linear p-polarization (E vector in the incidence plane).\nThe sample was positioned at a grazing angle of ~20o relative\nto the incident beam.\n\n-20 -15 -10\n\n-5\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25 E-EVBM (eV)\n\nFIG. 1. (top) Experimental N 1s off-resonant SXE spectrum\n(hvex~420eV) and SXA spectrum, in comparison with (gray curves\nbelow) theoretical results excluding and including the core hole. The\nempirical simulation of the lifetime and instrumental broadening\neffects (see the text) is shown on top of the theoretical curves. With\nour grazing incidence experimental geometry, the spectra reflect\nmainly the N pxy PDOS in the VB and N pz PDOS in the CB.\n\nThe SXA data were measured with the monochromator\nresolution set to 0.2 eV, which is comparable to the N 1s core\nlevel intrinsic width of about 0.1eV.9 The absorption signal\nwas recorded in total electron yield mode and normalized to\nthe photocurrent from a gold mesh introduced into the\nsynchrotron radiation beam upstream the experimental\nchamber.\n\nThe SXE measurements were performed with the\nspectrometer installed in the incidence plane at a scattering\nangle of 90o relative to the incident beam. SXE spectra were\ntaken in 1st diffraction order with a spherical grating of 5 m\nradius and 1200 lines/mm groove density, providing a\nresolution around 0.2 eV. The energy scale of the\nspectrometer was set using the tabulated characteristic X-ray\nline energies of the Co L\u03b1 and L\u03b2 lines from Ref. 16 recorded\nfrom a pure Co-foil in 2nd diffraction order. Based on the\nelastic peaks in the SXE spectra, this energy scale was then\nused to calibrate the monochromator relative to the\nspectrometer energy scale. For further experimental details\nsee Ref. 2.\n\nThe experimental SXA spectrum is shown in Fig.1 (right\nspectrum on top). With the N 1s core level, it reflects the CB\ncomposed predominantly of the antibonding N 2p states. Due\nto high anisotropy of GaN the SXA spectra show significant\nangle dependence (see below). Our spectrum is in good\nagreement with previous SXA data9,15 measured at similar\ngrazing geometry, although with slight differences in the peak\namplitudes due to a somewhat different incidence angle.\n\nThe experimental off-resonant SXE spectrum shown in Fig.1\n(top left spectrum) is in good agreement with previous off-\n\n2\n\n\fresonant data.8 This spectrum, taken at an excitation energy of\n428.7 eV, well above the N K-edge, was further used as a\nreference for the resonant series.\n\n375\n396\n\n398\n\n380\n400\n\nIn the energy region from 387 to 395 eV, the SXE spectrum\nshows the main N 2p line, reflecting the VB composed\npredominantly of the bonding N 2p states, with two peaks. In\naddition, it shows a sizeable structure near 377.5eV, which\nfirst was noticed in Ref. 8 and interpreted as due to\nhybridization of the Ga 3d semicore states with N 2p states.\nHowever, we find this structure about 2 eV deeper in energy\ncompared to Ref. 8. Due to better statistics and resolution we\ncan also identify a high-energy shoulder in this structure.\nDhesi et al.6 in their ARPES study of GaN ascribed a similar\nspectral feature to N 2s states.17\n\n402\n\n385\n404\n\n406\n\n390\n\n395\n\nh\u03bd (eV)\n\n408\n\nx5\nh\u03bdex (eV)\n398.4\n398.9\n\nThe experimental resonant SXE spectra in comparison with\nthe reference off-resonant one (at the bottom) are shown in\nFig.2. The corresponding excitation energies hvex in relation\nto the SXA structures (see inset of Fig. 2) are indicated on the\nright. The resonant spectra were measured with a\nmonochromator resolution of better than 0.2 eV, matching\nthat of the spectrometer. The resonant SXE series shows clear\ndispersions and lineshape changes of both spectral peaks in\nthe VB, with their dispersion ranges being about 0.3eV for\nthe lower-energy peak, and 1.0eV for the higher-energy one.\nThis identifies pronounced effects of momentum conservation\nin the RIXS spectra of GaN. Interestingly, the onset of the Ga\n3d derived structure with hvex seems to be slightly delayed\ncompared to the main N 2p line.\n\n399.3\n399.7\n400.1\n400.5\n400.9\n401.5\n402.1\n403.4\n405.4\n428.7\n\n-20\n\nIII.

Experimental N 1s resonant SXE series in comparison with\nthe off-resonant spectrum (bottom curve), all normalized to the\nsame peak value (relative to the foot background). The indicated\nexcitation energies hvex are also marked at the SXA spectrum\n(inset). The off-resonant energies of the two spectral peaks are\nmarked by dashed lines. The excitation energy dependent dispersion\nand line shape changes of the SXE structures identify effects of\nmomentum conservation in the RIXS process.\n\nOur computations of the band structure E(k) and PDOS were\nperformed within the standard DFT formalism. The electron\nexchange-correlation was described within the generalized\ngradient approximation (GGA).18 The calculations employed\na\nfull-potential\nLAPW+local\norbitals\nmethod19,20\nimplemented in the WIEN2k package (Ref. 21).\n\nchannels crucially depend on the ratio of the corresponding\nmatrix elements.)\n\nThe SXA and off-resonant SXE spectra were calculated\nwithin the same computational framework. The SXA\ncalculations were performed, first, with complete neglect of\nthe core hole within the 'initial-state approximation'22 (for\ncalculations including the core hole see below). The SXE\ncalculations employed 'the final-state rule', where the core\nhole is filled.23 Within these approaches the SXA/SXE\nspectra appear as the element and orbital projected PDOS,\nmultiplied with the energy dependent dipole matrix elements\nbetween the core and the corresponding CB/VB states.24\nSince the wave function of the core-states are well localized\ninside the atomic spheres (defined in the APW+lo method),\nthe integrals can be restricted to that region. These dipole\nmatrix elements are usually quite smooth functions with\nenergy and do not alter the corresponding PDOS too much.\n(This is different when one has a p-type core hole, e.g. an L2,3\nspectrum, where the contributions of the p\u2192s and p\u2192d\n\nIn view of the anisotropy of GaN, the PDOS and SXE/SXA\ncomputations were performed for the N pz and N pxy orbitals\nseparately. The SXE/SXA spectra relevant for our\nexperimental geometry were obtained by summation of the N\npz and N pxy spectra weighted by relative squared amplitudes\nof the E//c and E\u22a5c components of the E vector (see below).\nThe calculated SXE/SXA spectra are shown in Fig.1 in\ncomparison with the experiment. The smooth curves include\nempirical simulation of the valence hole and conduction\nelectron lifetimes. This was achieved by convolution with a\nLorentzian, whose full-width was taken proportional to the\nenergy distance from the Fermi level as 0.1*|E-EF|, where the\nproportionality coefficient was estimated from the\nexperimental spectral broadening. The experimental\nresolution was also included into this simulation by additional\n\n3\n\n\freflects mainly the unoccupied N pz orbitals. The same\nselection rules apply to SXE. Our experimental SXE\nspectrum is taken near the normal emission geometry with an\nangle of 20o to the surface normal. This yields the ratio\nbetween the N pz and N pxy contributions of about 1:7.5,\nreverse to the SXA case. Therefore, our SXE spectrum\nreflects mainly the occupied N pxy orbitals.\n\nGaussian convolution. These spectra were used to set the VB\nmaximum energy position in the experimental spectra by\naligning the SXE spectral leading edges.\nThe SXA computations were further extended to include\nexcitonic effects within the 'final-state approximation'22 by\ngeneration of a self-consistent-field (scf) potential in a\nsupercell with the core hole on a probe atom. These\ncomputations employed a 2x2x1 supercell (16 atoms/cell)\nwith one core hole (1s) on one of the N atoms. The missing\ncore electron was added to the valence electrons, and during\nthe scf-cycle all states (both of the particular atom with the\ncore hole and of all neighboring atoms) were allowed to\nrespond to this core hole (a larger \"effective nuclear-charge\")\nand screen the effect. We did not attempt to \"optimize\" the\ntheoretical spectra by choosing a partial core hole (e.g. half a\n1s electron), although it was shown previously that such an\napproach may lead to even better agreement with\nexperiment.22 The resulting SXA spectrum is also shown in\nFig.1. Further computational results are presented below on\nthe track of discussions.\n\nIn highly anisotropic wurtzite GaN, the PDOS associated with\nthe N pz and N pxy orbitals is significantly different. This is\nillustrated by computations in Fig.3. The SXE/SXA spectra\nare seen to be essentially the PDOS multiplied by the dipole\nmatrix element with weak energy dependence. The difference\nof the N pz and N pxy PDOS is thus replicated by differences\nof the corresponding grazing incidence and normal emission\nspectra giving rise to the angle dependence of the\ncorresponding SXA and SXE spectra. Dramatic differences of\nthe N pz and N pxy PDOS in the CB results in a particularly\n\nThe theoretical SXE/SXA spectra in Fig.1 demonstrate, on\nthe whole, convincing agreement with the experiment. Even\nsuch a subtle detail as the high-energy shoulder of the Ga 3d\nderived peak is well reproduced. Some energy shifts between\nthe spectral structures from theory and experiment can be\nattributed to the excited-state self-energy corrections, and\nrelative amplitude disagreements to the excitonic effects (see\nbelow).\n\nN pxy: SXE/SXA\n\nOur computational results are a major improvement compared\nto the previous LMTO calculations from Ref. 15, which were\nrestricted by the use of the muffin-tin (MT) potential. This\nillustrates the importance of full-potential effects in covalent\nmaterials such as GaN.\n\nPDOS\n\nIV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS\nA. SXA and off-resonant SXE\nN pz: SXE/SXA\n\nAnisotropy effects\nIn GaN the VB and CB are dominated by the N 2pz and 2pxy\norbitals oriented, respectively, parallel and perpendicular to\nthe (0001) surface normal c. The selection rules in SXA are\nsuch that the excitation cross-section into a particular porbital is maximized if the incident E vector is oriented\nparallel to the orbital axis, and vanishes if perpendicular.25\nTherefore, the E//c component of the E vector excites the pz\norbitals, and the E\u22a5c component the pxy ones. Our\nexperimental SXA spectrum is taken near the grazing\nincidence geometry with a grazing incidence angle of 20o. In\nthis case the ratio between (E//c)2 and (E\u22a5c)2, representing\nthe relative weight of the N pz and N pxy contributions to the\nSXA spectrum, is about 7.5:1. Therefore, the SXA spectrum\n\nPDOS\n\n-20 -15 -10\n\n-5\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nE-EVBM (eV)\n\nFIG. 3.

The lifetime and instrumental broadening is simulated as in\nFig.1.\n\n4\n\n\fstrong angle dependence of the SXA spectra.9,15 The\ntheoretical SXE/SXA spectra in Fig.1, corresponding to our\nexperimental geometry, were obtained as a superposition of\nthe N pz and N pxy ones weighted according to the (E//c)2 to\n(E\u22a5c)2 ratio.\nCore hole effects in SXA\nN pxy\n\nThe core hole generated in the SXA process in fact\ndynamically interacts with the valence electrons and modifies\nthe crystal potential around it (see, e.g., Ref. 26). One\nextreme static approximation to this process, implied by the\nabove SXA calculations, is the 'initial-state' approximation,\nwhere the core hole is completely ignored. Another extreme\nis the 'final-state' approximation,23 which considers a crystal\npotential resulting from static screening of the core hole by\nvalence electrons. It is often argued that the first extreme is\nmore relevant for metals, since they can have a better\neffective core-hole screening, while the second approach is\nmore relevant for insulators.22\nThe N pz and N pxy SXA spectra calculated with the screened\ncore hole are shown in Fig.4. In comparison with Fig.3,\ninclusion of the core hole is seen to change significantly the\namplitudes of the spectral structures. A superposition of the N\npz and N pxy spectra corresponding to our experimental\ngeometry is shown in Fig.1. The main change is a dramatic\nincrease of the first SXA peak. While in the no-hole case its\namplitude was underestimated compared to the experiment,\nthe core hole effects result in its overestimation. Moreover,\nthe third SXA peak appears reduced compared to the\nexperiment. Incompleteness of both 'initial-state' and 'finalstate' approximation suggest partial core hole screening22 with\nsignificant mobility of the valence charge in GaN.\n\nN pz\n\n-5\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25 E-EVBM (eV)\n\nFIG. 4.

However, their magnitude appears\nsmaller than the \u2206\u03a3 shift in the CB minimum (CBM), which\nis 1.5 eV as determined by the difference between the\nexperimental optical band gap of 3.4 eV and our calculated\none of 1.9 eV. In view of the expected \u2206\u03a3 increase with\nenergy, such an anomalous behavior of \u2206\u03a3 can indicate the\nself-energy effects depending on the wave function\ncharacter.27\n\nExcited-state self-energy corrections\nIn SXE, if the final-state rule23 is correct, the spectral\nstructures reflect the quasi-particle energy levels of the\nvalence hole with filled core hole. Their shifts from the DFT\nenergy levels are the self-energy corrections \u2206\u03a3, appearing\ndue to difference in the exchange-correlation potential\nbetween the excited and ground state. In our results we\nobserve \u2206\u03a3 values of almost zero for the dominant SXE peak,\n-0.4 for the smaller peak, and -4.3 eV for the Ga3d derived\npeak. As expected, \u2206\u03a3 increases when going away from the\nFermi level, and is particularly large for the Ga 3d derived\npeak due to the localized semicore character of this state.17\nIn SXA, the quasi-particle energy levels of conduction\nelectrons are distorted by interaction with the partially\nscreened core hole. If we correct from the interaction energy\nestimated, very roughly, as half the difference between the\nSXA calculations with and without the core hole, the \u2206\u03a3\nshifts for the three leading SXA peaks appear as 0.4, 1.3 and\n1.2 eV to higher energies. The sign of the shifts is consistent\nwith the band gap problem of the DFT, which neglects\n\nB. RIXS\nEnergy dependence of the coherent fraction\nChanges in the experimental resonant SXE series within the\nmain N 2p line region are emphasized in difference spectra\nshown in Fig.5 (top).

The hvex dependence of the latter is in fact equivalent to\nthe SXA spectrum, also shown in Fig.6, because the N 1s\ncore hole can be radiatively filled only from the N 2p VB\nstates (the contribution of the Ga 3d derived states is\nnegligible).\n\n398.4\n398.9\n399.3\n399.7\n400.1\n400.5\n400.9\n401.5\n402.1\n403.4\n\nThe coherent fraction in Fig.6 vanishes at higher energies\nbecause the strength of the e-ph and e-e interactions, driving\nthe scattering process into the incoherent channel, increases\nwith energy due to increase of the phase space available for\nthem. However, below hvex of 405eV our experimental data\ndemonstrate, surprisingly, that the coherent fraction weight\nbehaves non-monotonously and even increases with energy.\nThis fact is beyond the above simple phase space arguments.\nEvidently, the low-energy conduction states in GaN change\ntheir character in this energy region in such a way that their\nsusceptibility to the incoherent e-ph and e-e scattering\nsomehow varies. Tentatively, we attribute this effect to the\nanisotropy of the material. As the coherent fraction is larger\nin the region where the CB layer-projected DOS is dominated\nby N pxy states, it suggests that the incoherent scattering is in\nsome way less pronounced within the atomic layers than\nbetween the layers. Interestingly, the coherent fraction\nremains large up to rather high excitation energies.\n\n405.4\n\n-10 -8\n\n-6\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\nE-EVBM (eV)\n\n-10 -8\n\n-6\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\nE-EVBM (eV)\n\n\u0393\nM\nK\n\n\u2206q\n\n\u0393\nA\nH\nL\nA\n\n0.7\n-8\n\n-6\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\nE-EVBM (eV)\n\n0.6\n\nFIG. 5.

Taking into account the self-energy effects, this\nfigure is consistent with the theoretical energy -7.1 eV.\n\nk\u2013selectivity effects\nOur experimental SXE and SXA spectra should be related,\nwith our incidence and scattering angles, primarily to the\nbands in E(k) having significant N pxy character in the VB\nand N pz in the CB. Fig.5 (bottom) shows the calculated E(k)\nwhere the corresponding N 2pxy weights of the VB states and\nN 2pz of the CB states are indicated.\n\nIt should be noted that due to relatively high photon energies\nat the N K-edge the proper interpretation of RIXS requires\ntaking into account the photon momentum transfer. Also the\nGaN anisotropy effects become crucial, with the orbital\norientation selectivity allowing us to disentangle the kdispersions of various states;\n\nAs a link between the experimental spectra and calculated\nE(k), Fig.5 (middle) shows the calculated off-resonant N pxy\nSXE and N pz SXA spectra from Fig. 3. They are essentially\nequivalent to the corresponding PDOS. It should be noted that\nfor GaN the peaks in these spectra can not be unambiguously\nassociated with certain critical points along high-symmetry\nBrillouin zone (BZ) lines. This is because the complicated\nE(k) of GaN results in a multitude of critical points, including\nthose from non-symmetry BZ directions, whose energy\nseparation is smaller than the lifetime broadening.\n\n(2) with increase of hvex the k-vector, following the 2pz\nconduction band, moves away from the \u0393-point along the\n\u0393AH line. Correspondingly, the dominant SXE peak\ndisperses to lower energies, reflecting the 2pxy valence band\ndispersions along \u0393AH. Its dispersion range towards hvex of\n401eV, where the peak appears near the incoherent energy\nposition, is around 0.9 eV. With the calculated CB\ndispersions, this figure well matches the dispersion of the 2pxy\nheavy-hole valence bands. We do not detect any dispersion\nrenormalization due to coupling to the core hole. Any\ncontribution of the light-hole valence band is not seen in the\nSXE spectra because of its pz character in this region of the kspace;\n\nA few k-selectivity effects can nevertheless be\nunambiguously identified in evolution of the resonant SXE\nspectra with hvex (as emphasized in the difference spectra) in\ncomparison with the calculated E(k):\n(1) most remarkably, tuning hvex towards the absorption onset\nat 398.6 eV results in shifting of the dominant SXE peak to\nhigher energies, with an additional peak splitting off on its\nhigh energy side. As seen from the comparison of the\ncalculated SXA spectrum to the N pz band structure, for the\nabsorption onset energy the excited electrons appear in the\nCB already in some 1 eV above the CBM (such a delayed\nSXA onset occurs, as can be seen in the E(k) plot, because\nthe lowest CB states, depleted in the N p character and having\nrather steep dispersions, yield only a slight tail in the PDOS\nand thus in the SXA spectrum). The corresponding k-vectors\ndistribute near \u0393A in some 0.3 \u00c5-1 from the \u0393-point. The\nphoton wavevector transfer \u2206q=qout\u2013qin in our experiment has\nalmost the same value 0.28 \u00c5-1, and is also directed close to\n\u0393A. Therefore, as indicated in the E(k) panel, the kconserving RIXS process couples the excited N pz conduction\nelectrons to the N pxy valence holes in the VB maximum in\nthe \u0393-point, which results in a strong coherent emission from\nthe VB maximum appearing on the high-energy side of the\nmain incoherent peak. In the experimental resonant series this\nis seen as shifting of the SXE spectral maximum to higher\nenergies, with the coherent emission at the absorption\nthreshold splitting off in a separate peak.\n\n(3) with hvex varied near 401 eV, the SXE spectra display a\nsizeable dispersing coherent fraction below the smaller\nincoherent peak at higher binding energies. Based on the N pz\ndispersions in the CB, it can be associated with the N pxy\ndispersions in the M-valley near the VB bottom;\n(4) upon further increase of hvex above 401 eV the coherent\npeak moves to the other side of the incoherent one. Its energy\nposition can be associated with an integral effect of a few VB\ncritical points in ~2eV below the VBM such as that in the Mpoint.\nEmission angle dependence\nThe above discussion involving the anisotropy effects\nsuggests that the resonant SXE spectra should show certain\ndependence on the emission angle. To check this, we rotated\nthe sample towards the normal incidence and grazing\nemission geometry with a grazing emission angle of 20o,\nopposite to the experimental geometry above. In this case the\nabsorption is mainly due to the unoccupied N pxy orbitals and\nemission due to the occupied N pz ones. However, the SXE\nsignal in this geometry gets strongly suppressed due to the\nself-absorption. We have therefore measured only one\nrepresentative resonant SXE spectrum with hvex=399.3 eV not\nfar from the absorption threshold.\n\nTuning hvex below 398.2eV can be expected to shift the\nconduction electron closer to the \u0393-point, whereas the valence\nhole is shifted away from this point. This should result in\nshifting of the coherent peak again to lower energies.\nHowever, very low absorption in this hvex region makes such\nexperiment difficult.\n\nThe experimental grazing emission spectrum is shown in\nFig.7 compared with the normal emission one from Fig.2\nmeasured at the same hvex. Their difference is plotted below.\nThe spectra show statistically significant differences,\n\nThe VB minimum is placed in the same \u0393-point as the VBM.\nTherefore, it also shows an increase of the coherent SXE\n\n7\n\n\f375\n\n380\n\n385\n\n390\n\n395\n\nReferences\n\nh\u03bd (eV)\n\n*\n\nCorresponding authors.\n\nEmail: vladimir.strocov@psi.ch (Vladimir Strocov)\nEmail: Thorsten.Schmitt@maxlab.lu.se (Thorsten Schmitt)\n\n70o (~grazing)\n\n#\n\nPresent address: MAX-laboratory, Lund University, Box 118, S 22100 Lund, Sweden\n\n1\n\nP.O.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\nHigh-resolution SXE/SXA experimental data on wurtzite\nGaN near the N K-edge are presented. The measurements are\nsupported by full-potential calculations extended to the core\nhole screening.\nThe obtained results identify, in particular: (1) partial core\nhole screening in the SXA process; (2) effects of the GaN\nanisotropy in the SXE/SXA processes. Our experimental\ngeometry invoked primarily the pxy states in the VB and pz\nstates in the CB; (3) pronounced dispersions of the resonant\nSXE structures, identifying the effects of momentum\nconservation and k-selectivity in the RIXS process; (4) nonmonotonous behavior of the coherent SXE fraction, reflecting\ndifferent effects of the involved CB states in the e-e and e-ph\nscattering.\nIn view of a wide range of optoelectronic applications of\nGaN, especially in the short wavelength region, our findings\non the k-selectivity and anisotropy effects in RIXS can be\nutilized to guide future development in GaN based\nnanostructure devices by controlling direct vs indirect band\ngap character and crystallographic orientation of GaN\nnanostructures.\n\n8\n\n10\n\nS.
