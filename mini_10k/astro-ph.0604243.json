Improving the member census of the NGC 2264 star forming region and studying the origin of X-ray activity in young PMS stars.\nMethods. We analyze a deep, 100 ksec long, Chandra ACIS observation covering a 17'x17' field in NGC 2264. The preferential detection in\nX-rays of low mass PMS stars gives strong indications of their membership. We study X-ray activity as a function of stellar and circumstellar\ncharacteristics by correlating the X-ray luminosities, temperatures and absorptions with optical and near-infrared data from the literature.\nResults. We detect 420 X-ray point sources. Optical and NIR counterparts are found in the literature for 85% of the sources. We argue that\nmore than 90% of these counterparts are NGC 2264 members, thus significantly increasing the known low mass cluster population by about 100\nobjects. Among the sources without counterpart about 50% are likely associated with members, several of which we expect to be previously\nunknown protostellar objects. With regard to activity we confirm several previous findings: X-ray luminosity is related to stellar mass, although\nwith a large scatter; LX /Lbol is close to but almost invariably below the saturation level, 10\u22123 , especially when considering the quiescent X-ray\nemission. A comparison between CTTS and WTTS shows several differences: CTTS have, at any given mass, activity levels that are both lower\nand more scattered; emission from CTTS may also be more time variable and is on average slightly harder than that of WTTS. However, we\nfind evidence in some CTTS of extremely cool \u223c 0.1 \u2212 0.2keV, plasma which we speculate is heated by accretion shocks.\nConclusions. Activity in low mass PMS stars, while generally similar to that of saturated MS stars, may be significantly affected by mass\naccretion in several ways: accretion is likely responsible for very soft X-ray emission directly produced in the accretion shock; it may reduce\nthe average energy output of solar-like coronae, at the same time making them hotter and more dynamic. We briefly speculate on a physical\nscenario that can explain these observations.\nKey words.

Introduction\nThe collapse of molecular cores and the early evolution of premain sequence (PMS) stars+disk systems involve a variety of\ncomplex phenomena leading to the formation of main sequence\n(MS) stars and planetary systems. Most of these phenomena,\nand their influence on the outcome of the formation process,\nare not yet fully understood.\nX-ray observations of star forming regions have proved an\ninvaluable tool for star formation studies. On one hand, because\nof the much higher luminosity of PMS stars in the X-ray band\nwith respect to older field stars, deep imaging observations are\none of the few effective means of selecting unbiased samples of\nmembers comprising both classical T-Tauri stars (CTTS) and,\nmost importantly, the otherwise hard to distinguish weak line TTauri stars (WTTS). Selection of a complete member sample is\nof paramount importance for any star formation study, such as\nthose focused on the initial mass function (Salpeter, 1955), the\nstar formation history (e.g. Palla & Stahler, 2000), the evolution\nSend offprint requests to: E. Flaccomio\n\nof circumstellar disks and planetary systems (e.g. Haisch et al.,\n2005), and binarity (e.g. Lada, 2006). On the other hand, the\nconspicuous X-ray activity of PMS stars is one of the aspects of\nthe PMS stellar evolution that are not yet well understood, both\nwith respect to its physical origin and to its consequences for\nthe stellar/planetary formation process. Indeed, the ionization\nand heating caused by the penetrating X-ray emission might\nhave a significant impact on the evolution of star/disk systems\n(Igea & Glassgold, 1999; Glassgold et al., 2004) as well as on\nthat of the star forming cloud as a whole (Lorenzani & Palla,\n2001).\nThe high X-ray activity levels of PMS stars (e.g. Preibisch\net al., 2005) have often been attributed to a \"scaled up\" solarlike corona formed by active regions. This is the same picture\nproposed for MS stars, for which the X-ray activity is related\nto the stellar rotation (e.g. Pizzolato et al., 2003), evidence that\na stellar dynamo is responsible for the creation and heating of\ncoronae. For most non-accreting PMS stars (WTTS), the fractional X-ray luminosity, LX /Lbol , is indeed close to the saturation level, 10\u22123 , seen on rapidly rotating MS stars (Flaccomio\n\n\f2\n\nE. Flaccomio et al.: ACIS-I observations of NGC 2264\n\net al., 2003b; Preibisch et al., 2005; Pizzolato et al., 2003). This\nmight suggest a common physical mechanism for the emission\nof X-rays in WTTS and MS stars or, at least, for its saturation.\nHowever, the analogy with the Sun and MS stars may not be\nfully valid: first of all, the relation between activity and rotation is not observed in the PMS (Preibisch et al., 2005; Rebull\net al., 2006). Moreover, with respect to the Sun at the maximum\nof its activity cycle, saturated WTTS have LX /Lbol \u223c 1000\ntimes greater and plasma temperatures that are also significantly higher.\nThe X-ray emission of CTTS, PMS stars that are still undergoing mass accretion, poses even more puzzles. With their\ncircumstellar disks and magnetically regulated matter inflows\nand outflows, CTTS are complex systems. With respect to\ntheir X-ray activity, the bulk of the observational evidence\npoints toward phenomena similar to those occurring on WTTS.\nHowever, CTTS have significantly lower and unsaturated values of LX and LX /Lbol (Damiani & Micela, 1995; Flaccomio\net al., 2003a; Flaccomio et al., 2003b; Preibisch et al., 2005).\nIn apparent contradiction with this latter result, high-resolution\nX-ray spectra of two observed CTTS, TW Hydrae (Kastner et\nal., 2002; Stelzer & Schmitt, 2004) and BP Tau (Schmitt et al.,\n2005), have indicated that soft X-rays may be also produced in\naccretion shocks at the base of magnetic funnels. Moreover,\nmagnetic loops connecting the stellar surface with the inner\nparts of a circumstellar disk may produce some of the strongest\nand longer lasting flares observed on PMS stars (Favata et\nal., 2005). The recent detection of X-ray rotational modulation\n(Flaccomio et al., 2005), however implies that emitting structures are generally compact, so that these long loops cannot\ndominate the quiescent X-ray emission.\nNGC 2264 is a \u223c3 Myr old Star Forming Region located\nat \u223c760 pc (Sung et al., 1997) in the Monoceros. Compared\nto the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) and Taurus, NGC 2264\nhas intermediate stellar density and total population, making\nit an interesting target for investigating the dependence of star\nformation on the environment. It is on average older than the\nONC (\u223c 1Myr), but star formation is still active inside the\nmolecular cloud in at least two sites where a number of protostars and prestellar clumps have been detected (Young et al.,\n2006; Peretto et al., 2006). It is therefore an useful target for\nthe study of the formation and time evolution of young stars.\nIts study is eased by the presence of an optically thick background cloud, effectively obscuring unrelated background objects, and by the low and uniform extinction of the foreground\npopulation (Walker, 1956; Rebull et al., 2002). Despite being\nthe first star forming region ever identified as such, the low\nmass population of NGC 2264 is still not well characterized:\nproper motion studies (Vasilevskis et al., 1965) have been restricted to high mass objects; several studies have identified the\nclassical T-Tauri population using disk and accretion indicators (Park et al., 2000; Rebull et al., 2002; Lamm et al., 2004).\nPast X-ray observations with ROSAT (Flaccomio et al., 2000)\nhave been useful in identifying the weak line T-Tauri (WTTS)\npopulation, but have not been sensitive enough to detect low\nmass (M \u2264 0.3M\u2299 ) and embedded stars. We present here results from the analysis of a deep Chandra observation of the\nregion. Another similar observation of a region just to the north\n\nFig. 1. Digitized Sky Survey image of NGC 2264. The field of view\nof the Chandra-ACIS observation discussed in this paper is shown as\na white square. The famous Cone Nebula is visible toward the bottom\nof the image and the O7 star S Mon is close to the upper edge.\n\nof the one here considered has been analyzed by Ram\u0131\u0301rez et al.\n(2004a). The X-ray properties of NGC 2264 members derived\nin the present paper and by Ram\u0131\u0301rez et al. (2004a), augmented\nwith similar data for the Orion Flaking Fields (Ram\u0131\u0301rez et al.,\n2004b) are studied by Rebull et al. (2006) in comparison with\nthe results of the COUP survey (Getman et al., 2005). Results\nfrom the same Chandra observation analyzed here on the peculiar binary system KH 15D have been presented by Herbst &\nMoran (2005). Finally, the properties of three embedded X-ray\nsources near Allen's source, observed with XMM-Newton, have\nbeen recently presented by Simon & Dahm (2005).\nThe paper is organized as follows: we begin (\u00a72) with the\npresentation of the X-ray data, its reduction, source detection\nand photon extraction. In \u00a73 we then introduce the optical and\nnear infrared data used to complement the X-ray observation.\nIn \u00a74 we present the temporal an spectral analysis of X-ray\nsources and we derive X-ray luminosities. Sections 5 and 6 then\ndiscuss our results with respect to cluster membership and the\norigin of X-ray activity on PMS stars. We finally summarize\nand draw our conclusions in \u00a77.\n\n2. X-ray data and preparatory analysis\n\n2.1. The ACIS-I observation\nWe obtained a 97 ks long ACIS-I exposure of NGC 2264 on\n28 Oct. 2002 (Obs. Id. 2540; GO proposal PI S. Sciortino).\nThe 17\u2032 \u00d717\u2032 field of view (FOV) of ACIS is shown in figure 1,\nsuperimposed on the Digitized Sky Survey image of the region.\nIt was centered on R.A. 6h 40m 58.s 7, Dec. 9\u25e6 34\u2032 14\u2032\u2032 (roll angle:\n79\u25e6 ). Figure 2 shows a color rendition of the spatial and spectral\ninformation we obtained. ACIS was operated in FAINT mode\nwith CCD 0, 1, 2, 3, 6 and 7 turned on. Data obtained with CCD\n6 and 7, part of the ACIS-S array, will not be discussed in the\n\n\fE. Flaccomio et al.: ACIS-I observations of NGC 2264\n\nfollowing because of the much degraded point spread function\n(PSF) and effective area resulting from their large distance from\nthe optical axis.\n\n2.2. Data preparation\nData reduction, starting from the level 1 event file, was performed in a standard fashion, using the CIAO 2.3 package\nand following the threads provided by the Chandra X-ray\nCenter1 . Several IDL custom programs were also employed.\nFirst, we corrected the degradation in the spectral response due\nto the Charge Transfer Inefficiency (CTI), occurred in particular during the first months of the Chandra mission using the\n\uf761\uf763\uf769\uf773 \uf770\uf772\uf76f\uf763\uf765\uf773\uf773 \uf765\uf776\uf765\uf76e\uf774\uf773 CIAO task. We then produced a level 2\nevent file by retaining only events with grade=0,2,3,4,6 and status=0. Finally we corrected the data for the time dependence of\nthe energy gain using the \uf763\uf76f\uf772\uf772 \uf774\uf767\uf761\uf769\uf76e utility.\nX-ray stellar sources have, on average, a different spectrum\nwith respect to the ACIS background. The total signal to noise\nratio (SNR) of sources can therefore be maximized by filtering out events with energy outside a suitable spectral band: we\nfirst performed a preliminary source detection as discussed in\n\u00a72.3 on the whole event list. We then defined for each source\na radius, R97 , such that 97% of the PSF counts fall within this\nradius (\u00a72.4). We extracted source photons for all sources from\ncircles with R = 0.5 \u00d7 R97 and background photons from a single background region that excludes photons from all sources\nwithin their respective R97 (a sort of \"Swiss cheese\" image with\nthe sources carved out). We then computed the total SNR of\nsources2 for a fine grid of minimum and maximum energy cuts.\nThe highest source SNR was obtained for Emin = 200eV and\nEmax = 7000eV. With these cuts the number of photons in the\nsource extraction area (including background photons) is reduced to 96% of the total, while the background is reduced to\n28% of the total. We checked that consistent results are obtained by maximizing the SNR of faint sources only (<20 net\ncounts), which may have a different average spectrum and are\nthe ones we are most interested in for the purpose of detection.\nAfter filtering in energy, the time integrated background is\n0.07 counts per arcsec2 , consistent with nominal values. The\nbackground was constant in time except for a small flare with a\npeak reaching about twice the quiescent rate. The flare starts 13\nks after the beginning of the observation and lasts \u223c 1 ks. The\neffect of the background flare on source light curves is however negligible, even for faint sources, i.e. the most affected by\nthe background. This is confirmed by the negative results of\nKolmogorov-Smirnov variability tests (see \u00a74.1) performed on\nthe background extraction regions relative to each source. In\nthe study of source lightcurves (\u00a74.1) we will therefore assume\na constant background.\n1\n\nsee cxc.harvard.edu\npP\nP\n2\n(S i + \u03b1i B) where \u03b1i = Ais /Ab ; S i and\nS NRtot = (S i \u2212 \u03b1i B)/\ni\nA s are the number of counts in the i-th source regions and their area respectively. B and Ab are the background counts and relative extraction\narea, taken for the present purpose as uniform within the FOV.\n\n3\n\n2.3. Source detection\nWe detected sources using the PWDetect code (Damiani et al.,\n1997).3 The significance threshold was set to 4.6\u03c3. According\nto extensive simulations of source-free fields with the background level of our observation, this threshold corresponds\nto an expectancy of 10 spurious sources in the whole FOV.\nPWDetect reports 423 sources. Upon careful inspection we removed three entries relative to sources that were detected twice,\nleaving a total of 420 distinct sources. Twenty eight of these\nare below the 5.0\u03c3 significance threshold, corresponding to the\nmore conservative criteria of one expected spurious source in\nthe FOV. Background subtracted source counts, in the 0.2-7\nkeV band, are derived by PWDetect directly from the wavelet\ntransform of the data. Effective exposure times at the source positions, averaged over the PSF, are also computed by PWdetect\nfrom an exposure map created with standard CIAO tools assuming an input energy of 2.0 keV4 .\nDetected sources are listed in Table 1. In the first eight\ncolumns we report source number, sky positions with uncertainty, distance from the Chandra optical axis, source net\ncounts (in the 0.2-7keV band), effective exposure time, and the\nstatistical significance of the detection.\n\n2.4. Photon Extraction\nSource and background photon extraction for spectral and timing analysis was performed using CIAO and custom IDL software. We first determined for each source the expected PSF\nusing the CIAO \uf76d\uf76b\uf770\uf773\uf766 tool, assuming a monochromatic source\nspectrum (E=1.5 keV). We thus determined the expected encircled energy fraction as a function of distance from the source.\nPhotons extraction circles were defined so as to contain 90%\nof the PSF, save for 28 sources for which the encircled PSF\nfractions were reduced to values ranging from 74% to 89% to\navoid overlap with neighboring sources. The local background\nfor each source was determined from annuli whose inner radii\nexcludes 97% of the PSF and with outer radii twice as large.\nIn order to exclude contamination of the background regions\nfrom the emission of neighboring sources we excluded from\nthese annuli photons falling within the 97% encircled counts\nradii of all sources. The area of background extraction regions\nwere computed through a mask in which we drilled regions\noutside the detector boundaries and circles containing 97% of\nthe PSF photons from all sources.\nFor sources with at least 50 photons, source and background spectra suited to the XSPEC spectral fitting package\nwere then created using standard CIAO tools. Corresponding\nresponse matrices and effective areas (RMF and ARF files respectively) were also produced with CIAO. For spectral analysis, spectra were energy binned so that each bin contains\na fixed number of photons, depending on net source counts\n3\nAvailable at:\nhttp://www.astropa.unipa.it/progetti ricerca/PWDetect\n4\nThe choice of energy is not crucial: the ratio between the effective area at the source position and on the optical axis, which is the\nquantity we use to define the effective exposure time, has only a small\ndependence on energy.\n\n\f4\n\nE.

Cross-identifications - optical/NIR catalogs\nWe have cross-identified our X-ray source list with catalogs\nfrom the following optical/NIR surveys covering the whole\narea of our ACIS field: 2Mass (NIR photometry), Walker\n(1956, optical photometry + spectroscopy), Rebull et al.\n(2002, optical/NIR photometry + low resolution optical spec-\n\ntroscopy)5, Lamm et al. (2004, optical photometry + variability), Dahm & Simon (2005, optical photometry + spectroscopy), Flaccomio et al. (2000, X-ray sources). The seven\ncross-identified catalogs are listed in the first column of table\n2. In the 2nd column we indicate the number of objects within\nthe ACIS FOV and in the third the number of objects identified\nwith ACIS sources and of those for which the identification is\nunique. Adopted positional tolerances for cross-identifications\nare reported in the 4th column, either as a single figure for the\nwhole catalog or as a range when defined for each individual\n5\nThe Rebull et al.

The entire table, containing 420 entries, is available in the electronic edition of A&A.\n\nobject (see the table footnotes). They are based on the uncertainties quoted for each catalog.\nAmong the catalogs here considered, the deepest photometric surveys are 2Mass in the NIR (JHKs6 ) and Lamm\net al. (2004) in the optical (VRc Ic ). A comparison with the\nisochrones of Siess et al. (2000, hereafter, SDF) in the optical and NIR color-magnitude diagrams (Fig. 3 and 4), indicates that at the distance of NGC 2264, 2Mass reaches down\nto about 0.1M\u2299 for 10Myr old stars, i.e. the oldest expected in\nthe region, while Lamm et al. (2004) reaches slightly deeper for\nunabsorbed stars, but is obviously less sensitive to highly absorbed ones. Within the ACIS FOV, spectral types are given for\n7 stars by Walker (1956), for 87 stars by Rebull et al. (2002),\nfor 150 stars by Lamm et al. (2004) and for 157 stars by Dahm\n& Simon (2005).\nWe created a master list of cross-identified objects following a step-by-step procedure. In the first step we matched ACIS\nsources with 2Mass objects: first we registered the ACIS coordinates to the 2Mass ones by iteratively cross-identifying the\ntwo catalogs and shifting the ACIS coordinates by the mean\noffset of uniquely identified source pairs. Identification radii\nwere chosen as the quadrature sum of the above defined position tolerances (table 2). We then created a joint catalog of objects containing all matched and unmatched ACIS and 2Mass\nobjects, assigning to them coordinated from 2MASS when\navailable. In the following step we repeated the above process\nusing the ACIS+2Mass catalog as reference and matching it\nwith the Rebull et al. (2002) one. We then repeated the process\nwith the Flaccomio et al. (2000) X-ray source list, then with the\nLamm et al. (2004), Dahm & Simon (2005) and Walker (1956)\ncatalogs. The coordinate shifts of all considered catalogs with\nrespect to the 2Mass system are given in table 2 (columns 5 and\n6), along with the median offsets between object positions and\nthe reference 2Mass catalog. After each step, identified source\npairs and unidentified objects were checked individually and\na small fractions of the identifications (< 1%) were modified.\nIn the first step for example, five identifications between four\nACIS and five 2Mass sources were added: in two cases (sources\n6\n\nNote that in the following we neglect the small differences among\nNIR photometric systems, and in particular that between the 2MASS\nKs and the standard K bands.\n\n#64 and #404) 2Mass sources were only slightly more distant\nwith respect to the identification radii. In another case the Xray source, #102, was situated at the edge of the detector and\nits positions was surely more uncertain than the formal error\nindicated. In the last case the X-ray source, #237, was detected\nbetween two close-by 2Mass objects and an identification was\nforced with both.\nTable 3 lists, for the 1888 distinct objects in the ACIS FOV,\nconsolidated coordinates and cross-identifications numbers for\neach of the seven catalogs. 425 rows refer to objects related to\none of the 420 ACIS sources: 351 are identified with a single\noptical/NIR counterpart, two are identified with 5 and 2 counterparts respectively, and 67 do not have any optical or nearinfrared identification. The other 1463 rows in table 3 refer to\nnon ACIS-detected objects. For these latter we computed upper limits to the ACIS count rate using PWdetect and the same\nevent file used for source detection. Measured count rates, repeated from table 1, and upper limits are reported in column 12\nof table 3.\nFocusing on the identification of ACIS sources with optical/NIR catalogs, given the relatively large number objects in\nthe field of view, we can wonder how many of the identifications are due to chance alignment and not to a true physical\nassociation. We can constrain the number of chance identifications by assuming that positions in the two lists are fully uncorrelated. Because this is surely not the case for our full Xray source catalog, our estimate can only be considered a loose\nupper limit. Furthermore, limiting our X-ray sample to the 28\nsources with significance below 5.0\u03c3, 9 of which are expected\nto be spurious and whose positions will indeed be random, we\ncan place an upper limit on the fraction of spurious sources associated with an optical object. This value is of interest when\nstudying the X-ray properties of optically/NIR selected samples. In order to estimate the number of spurious identifications assuming uncorrelated positions, we proceed as follows:\nfor each X-ray source we consider optical objects within a circular neighborhood of area Anei , within which source density is\nassumed uniform; we then estimate the fraction of Anei covered\nby identification circles. The sum of these fractions is our upper limit to the number of chance identifications. We repeated\nthe calculation for radii of the neighborhood circle from 1.0\u2032\n\n\f6\n\nE.

Tracks and isochrones are by\nSDF.\n\nmetric corrections, BC I , and intrinsic colors, (R \u2212 I)0 , using\nthe relations compiled by Kenyon & Hartmann (1995) and,\nfor the temperature of M stars, the intermediate gravity scale\nof Luhman (1999). Using the available Rc and Ic photometry we then derived extinction values (AV = 4.46 \u00d7 E(R \u2212 I),\nwhere E(R \u2212 I) = (R \u2212 I)0 \u2212 (R \u2212 I)) and bolometric luminosities (Lbol = \u22120.4 \u00d7 [Ic \u2212 BC I \u2212 AV /1.63 \u2212 DM(760pc)]).\nFinally we estimated masses and ages from the theoretical HR\ndiagram, figure 5, through interpolation of the SDF evolutionary tracks. In summary, out of the 351 X-ray sources with an\nunique optical/NIR identification, we estimated T e f f for 165\nX-ray sources, AV and Lbol for 163, masses and ages for 161.\n\nOther than the sample of X-ray detected stars, that, as discussed in \u00a75 are likely cluster members, we will also consider\nanother sample of 83 X-ray undetected likely cluster members. These latter, plotted with empty symbols in figure 3, 4\nand 5, are chosen according to their position in the I vs. RI diagram, the strength of the H\u03b1 line (measured either spectroscopically or photometrically) and optical variability: first,\nwe define a cluster locus in the I vs. R-I diagram using the\nSDF tracks and the observed concentration of X-ray sources.\nThe cluster locus is defined as the area above the 107.1 Myr\nisochrone or to the left of the 0.8M\u2299 evolutionary track.7 We\nthen consider as likely members: stars in the cluster locus and\nwith strong H\u03b1 emission according to the narrow-band H\u03b1 photometry of Lamm et al. (2004), using the same criterion discussed by these authors; stars in the cluster locus with moderate (chromospheric) H\u03b1 emission and with variable optical\nlightcurves (both periodic and irregular), again as discussed by\nLamm et al. (2004); stars for which spectroscopic observations\nof the H\u03b1 line are available and for which the measured EW\nis larger than 10 (the canonical CTTS threshold). Among this\nsample of 83 X-ray undetected likely members we are able to\ndetermine masses and ages for 16 stars.\nIn order to derive intrinsic X-ray luminosities of detected\nstars or upper limits for undetected ones, knowledge of the extinction is fundamental (\u00a74.3). For stars with no optical spectral\ntype AV cannot be determined as indicated above. We therefore\nestimated extinctions from the NIR J-H vs. H-K diagram by\nde-reddening stars that could be placed in this diagram onto the\nexpected intrinsic locus. This latter was taken from Kenyon &\nHartmann (1995) for the stellar contribution and supplemented\nwith the CTTS locus of Meyer et al. (1997). The degeneracy in\nthe reddening solutions was solved by always taking the first\nintercept between the intrinsic locus and the reddening vector.\nStars whose position was within 1.5\u03c3 of the loci were assigned\nzero extinction.

Cross-identifications - MIR/mm catalogs\nIn addition to the wide field surveys described in \u00a73.1 we\nhave also correlated our X-ray sources with three mid-infrared\n(MIR) and millimeter (mm) catalogs recently published for\nthe IRS 2 and IRS 1 regions: Young et al. (2006, hereafter\nY06), Teixeira et al. (2006, T06) and Peretto et al. (2006, P06).\nThese three surveys target very young and/or embedded objects and are therefore ideal for checking the nature of X-ray\nsources with no optical/NIR counterpart. They are however\nlimited in area coverage: T06 lists Class I/0 sources detected\nwith SPITZER in a \u223c 3 \u00d7 3 arcmin2 region close to IRS 2; Y06\nlists all SPITZER detected objects in a dense but even smaller\n\u223c 2 \u00d7 2 arcmin2 region slightly south-east of IRS 2; P06 list the\npre/protostellar cores detected at 1.2mm in both the IRS 1 and\nIRS 2 regions.\nWithin the area of Y06, the only MIR work available so\nfar that lists all the objects detected in the surveyed region,\nwe find MIR counterparts for 2 out of 4 X-ray sources lacking optical/NIR counterparts. In total 4 of the 67 unidentified\nX-ray sources were assigned new counterparts: #145 was associated with source 12 of T06, a Class I/0 source; #228 was\nassociated with the D-MM 15 mm core, indicated by P06 as\nprobably starless; #244 was associated with source 43 in Y06\nand is, judging from its spectral energy distribution (SED), an\nabsorbed class II/III PMS star that is relatively bright in Kband (K = 12.15, Y06)8 ; finally #274 was associated with the\nD-MM 10 mm core, indicated as starless by P06, with source\n1656 in Y06 and source 15 in T06 (characterized by a steeply\nrising MIR SED).\nAmong the X-ray sources with optical/NIR counterparts,\n17 in the region covered by Y06 were identified with SPITZER\n8\nNote that the source is missed by 2MASS because, at the 2MASS\nspatial resolution, it is blended with a nearby source\n\nsources of which one, #281, is a likely Class I source (Y06's\nsource 62). Three more X-ray sources were identified with\nClass I/0 sources in the list of T06: #150 and #242 also having NIR counterparts and #194 (see also \u00a76.3) with both NIR\nand optical (I = 19.89) counterpart. As for the P06 mm-cores,\nidentifications are made uncertain by the limited spatial resolution of the mm data (cf. P06). The core D-MM 14, classified as\nprotostellar by P06, is likely associated with ACIS source #89\n(offset: 1.2\"), an optically faint (V = 20.91) and NIR bright\n(K = 10.6) star with large H\u03b1 emission: EW(H\u03b1 ) = 458.\nQuite similarly, C-MM 1, also indicated as a protostellar core\nby P06, is offset by 1.3\" from the ACIS source #361, an optically visible source with strong H\u03b1 (V = 18.55, K = 11.85,\nEW(H\u03b1 ) = 231)9 and it is therefore likely associated with\nit. Finally, C-MM 5, classified by P06 as a protostellar core,\nmight be associated with ACIS # 305 (offset: 1.9\"). This ACIS\nsource is in turn most likely associated with IRS 1 (offset: 0.8\",\nSchreyer et al., 2003). Note however that P06 suggests that CMM 5 may not be associated with IRS 1.\nA more detailed analysis of the X-ray properties of young\nprotostars in NGC 2264 will be the subject of a future paper.\n\n4. Analysis\n\n4.1. Temporal analysis\nSource variability was characterized through the KolmogorovSmirnov test. Column (9) of table 1 reports the resulting probability that the distribution of photon arrival times is not compatible with a constant count-rate. Given the sample size (420\nsources) a value below 0.1% (obtained for 72 sources) indicates the light-curve is almost certainly variable, while a <1%\nvalue (87 sources) indicates a very likely variability, although\nup to \u223c 4(= 420 \u00d7 0.01) of the variable sources might actually\nbe constant. If we are not interested in the individual sources\nbut on the overall fraction of variable sources, we can place a\nlower limit on this quantity by computing the minimum number of variable sources as a function of probability threshold,\nPth : Nmin = N(PKS < Pth ) \u2212 420 \u00d7 Pth . The maximum Nmin\n9\nAlthough Y06 report that C-MM 1 has no NIR counterpart, we\nassociate it with 2MASS source 06411792+0929011 (offset=1.5\").\n\n\fE. Flaccomio et al.: ACIS-I observations of NGC 2264\n\n9\n\nis obtained for Pth = 15% for which N(PKS < Pth ) = 189\nand Nmin = 126. We conclude that within our observation at\nleast 30% (126/420) of the lightcurves are statistically inconsistent with constancy. This fraction is surely a lower limit to\nthe true number of variable sources, as our ability to tell a variable source from a constant one is influenced by photon statistics. This is clearly indicated by the dependence of the fraction\nof variable sources on source counts. If for example, we restrict\nthe above analysis to sources with more than 100(500) counts,\na total of 145(33) sources, we find that at least 54%(73%) of\nthese are variable.\n\nWe next investigated whether different kind of stars, classified from optical data, showed different variability fractions.\nFrom the previous discussion, it is clear that for a meaningful comparison, source statistic must be taken into account.\nFigure 6 shows the variability fraction, f (PKS < 1%), as a\nfunction of source counts for CTTS and WTTS, as discriminated by their H\u03b1 equivalent width. Variability fractions are\ncomputed for sources with counts in intervals spanning 0.8\ndex (because in the figure points are spaced by 0.1 dex, only\none point every eighth is independent). Error bars on the variability fractions are estimated assuming binomial statistics:\n\u03b4 f = [ f \u00d7 (1 \u2212 f )/N src ]1/2 , where N src is the number of sources\nin each count bin. In addition to the expected increase of the\nvariability fraction with source statistics, we note that CTTS\nappear to be more variable with respect to WTTS, at least\nwhen considering stars with more than \u223c200 counts. Figure\n7 shows a similar comparison for two mass segregated subsamples: 0.3 < M/M\u2299 < 0.7 and 0.7 < M/M\u2299 < 2.0. Lower\nmass stars appear to be more variable, and again this difference\nis noticeable only for stars that are bright enough. We quantified the differences between variability fractions, by testing,\nfor each count bin, the null hypothesis that the two samples are\ndrawn from the same parent population. We chose as statistics\nthe difference of the two observed variability fractions, \u2206 f . We\nthen numerically computed the probability that a \u2206 f equal or\nlarger than the observed one is obtained by randomly drawing pairs of numbers from binomial distributions appropriate\nto the two sample sizes but characterized by the same probability of observing a variable source, i.e the variability fraction.\nBecause this latter number is not well constrained we conservatively took as our confidence level the minimum that is obtained varying this fraction between 0 and 1. The results of\nthese test indicate that the differences in the variability fractions\nare statistically not highly significant: in the bin centered at\n\u223c 400 counts, the low mass stars are more variable than higher\nmass stars with a 94% confidence. In the bin centered at \u223c 800\ncounts, CTTS are more variable than WTTS with a 92% confidence. We thus consider these results as tentative. However\nwe note that the significance of the difference between CTTS\nand WTTS is strengthened by the fact that a similar result, and\nwith a similar confidence, was also obtained by Flaccomio et al.\n(2000) using totally independent ROSAT data.\n\nFig. 6. Fraction of variable stars as a function of count statistics for\nstars with H\u03b1 EW greater and smaller than 10 (i.e. CTTS and WTTS).\nNote that counts bin are centered at the plot symbol and are 0.8 dex\nwide, so that successive bins are not independent. Error bars are based\non binomial statistics. Symbols referring to the two subsamples are\nslightly shifted in the horizontal direction with respect to each other\nso to avoid confusion.

Spectral analysis\nWe have analyzed the X-ray spectra of the 199 sources with\nmore than 50 detected photons. Spectral fits were performed\n\n\f10\n\nE.

Values in italic indicate that fit parameters were fixed to\nthose values.\n\nwith XSPEC 11.3 and several shell and TCL scripts to automate the process. For each source we fit the data in the [0.57.0]keV energy interval10 with several model spectra: one and\ntwo isothermal components (\uf761\uf770\uf765\uf763), subject to photoelectric absorption from interstellar and circumstellar material (\uf777\uf761\uf762\uf773).\nPlasma abundances for one temperature models were fixed at\n0.3 times the solar abundances (Wilms et al., 2000), while for\ntwo temperature models they were both fixed at that value and\ntreated as a free parameter. The absorbing column densities,\nNH , were both left as a free parameter and fixed at values corresponding to the optically/NIR determined extinctions, when\navailable: NH = 1.6 1021 AV (Vuong et al., 2003). A total of\nthree or six models were thus fit for each source depending on\nthe availability of optical extinction values. For each model,\nspectral fits were performed starting from several initial conditions for the fit parameters as indicated in table 5. For example\nfor isothermal models with free NH , two values of NH and four\nvalues of kT were adopted as initial conditions, for a total of\neight distinct fits. For each model the adopted fit parameter set\nwas chosen from the model fit that minimize the \u03c72 . This procedure was adopted in order to reduce the risk that the \u03c72 minimization algorithm used by XSPEC finds a relative minimum.\nNext, we considered which of the available model fits for\neach source (three or six, reference model names are given in\ntable 5) was the most representative of the true source spectra, and thus the one to be adopted for the following considerations. The goal was twofold: to characterize the emitting\nplasma in order to investigate its origin, and to determine accurate intrinsic band-integrated X-ray luminosities. Crucial for\nthis latter step is the determination of extinction (NH , see \u00a74.3).\nGenerally speaking, models must have enough components to\nyield statistically acceptable fits according to the \u03c72 or, equivalently, the null probabilities (n.p.) that the observed spectra\nare described by the models. However, models with too many\nfree parameters with respect to the spectra statistics, while formally yielding good fits, will not be constrained by the data\nand will yield limited physical information. A particularly severe problem with CCD quality (ACIS) low statistic spectra is\nthe degeneracy between absorption and temperature: an equally\ngood fit can be often obtained with a cool plasma model with a\nlarge emission measure but suffering high absorption, or with a\nwarmer temperature and a lower extinction. It is therefore de10\n\nEvents with energies below 0.5keV were not used because of uncertainties in the calibration resulting from the time dependent degradation of the ACIS quantum efficiency at low energies.\n\nFig. 8. Cumulative distribution of null probabilities resulting from Xray spectral fits. The curves refer here to X-ray sources with more that\n50 counts (the minimum for which we performed spectral fits) and less\nthan 300 counts. The different lines refer to different physical models\n(one and two temperature, with free of fixed NH ) as indicated in the\nlegend, along with the number of sources that enter in each distribution. For the models with fixed NH we also indicate the number of NH\nderived from optical spectral types + photometry and of those derived\nfrom 2MASS J, H and K photometry. The gray thick line refers to the\n\"best\" choice of models described in \u00a74.2.\n\nsirable to check the NH obtained from the fits with independent\ninformation from optical/NIR data. Figures 8 and 9 show, for\nfaint and bright sources (50 < cnts < 300, cnts > 300) respectively, the cumulative distribution of the n.p. for spectral\nfits performed with four different models. The models are 1T,\n2T, and, for sources with independent NH estimates, 1TAv and\n2TAv . In this kind of plot the distribution for a perfectly adequate spectral model should follow the diagonal, that for an\noversimplified model should fall below the diagonal, and that\nfor an over-specified model should lie above. For faint sources\n1T model appears perfectly adequate. Fixing the NH to the optically determined value worsen the agreement somewhat but\nstill results in fits that are, when considered individually, for the\nmost part acceptable. A two temperature model with free NH\nappears to be too complicated (and therefore unconstrained),\nwhile a 2T model with fixed NH is more acceptable, but still on\naverage too sophisticated for the quality of these low-statistic\nspectra. For brighter sources we notice instead that 1 temperature models are on average not favored, while 2T models are\nstill not always needed.\nFor most sources more than one spectral model is statistically acceptable. We choose a best guess model as the simplest that still gives a statistically acceptable fit. The compelling reason to choose this approach is the mentioned degeneracy between temperature and absorption. Note for example\nthat from figure 8, one could be tempted to always choose, for\nfaint sources, 1T models with free NH , as these models appear\n\n\fE. Flaccomio et al.: ACIS-I observations of NGC 2264\n\nFig. 9. Same as figure 8 for sources with more than 300 counts.\n\nto be statistically perfectly adequate to represent the spectra.\nHowever, when examined individually, many of these 1T spectral fits have rather degenerate fit solutions, i.e. large and correlated uncertainties on the NH and kT values, also implying\nlarge uncertainties on unabsorbed fluxes. This degeneracy can\nbe broken by using the additional information on absorption\ncoming from optical/NIR data, when available and compatible\nwith the X-ray spectra.\nAfter some experimenting, we choose our best guess model\naccording to the following empirical scheme: if n.p.(1TAv ) >\n20% we chose the 1TAv model. Otherwise, if n.p.(1T)> 20%\nwe chose the 1T model (with free NH ). If both of the previous\ntests for isothermal models failed, we tried with two temperature models, this time lowering our n.p. threshold to 5%. First\nwe tried the 2TAv model (n.p.(2TAv ) > 5%) and then the 2T\nmodel (n.p.(2T)> 5%). As a last resort, in case none of the\nprevious models could be adopted, we choose the 2Tab model\n(free NH , free abundances). Although the above scheme was\ndesigned so to favor simple models, the different n.p. thresholds resulted in four cases (sources #257, #275, #280 and #300)\nin adopting 2Tab models that were either statistically worse or\ncomparable to simpler 1T, 1TAv or 2TabAv models. We therefore adopted these latter. After careful examination of individual fits, the spectral models adopted for four more sources\n(#97, #104, #127 and #241) were modified. In these cases the\nautomatic choice would result in unphysical, unusual, or unconstrained temperatures and absorptions, whereas our adopted\nmodels are acceptable both statistically and physically.11\n11\n\nFor source #241 we changed the 2T model (n.p.=32%, kT 1 =\n1.30\n21\n21\n\u22122\n0.0577.8\n0.022 keV, kT 2 = 0.570.30 keV, NH = 131.8 10 cm ) to a 1T model\n6.5\n21\n\u22122\n(n.p.=17%, kT = 0.600.84\nkeV,\nN\n=\n3.3\n10\ncm\n).

For sources #97 and #127 we changed from\n1T Av models (p=68% & p=0.21%, kT = 54 keV & kT = 19 keV, both\n\n11\n\nThe solid gray lines in figure 8 and 9 refer to the final choice\nof best guess models. Table 6 lists the end result of our spectral analysis: we report the adopted model, the source of the\nadopted NH , the null probability, the plasma temperature(s) and\nnormalization(s), the observed and absorption corrected fluxes\nin the [0.5-7]keV band.\nIn summary, out of the 199 sources with more than 50\ncounts, we adopt isothermal models in 147 cases and two component models in the remaining 52 cases. For 138 sources we\nadopt a spectral fit in which the NH was fixed, in 101 cases to\nthe value estimated from the optically determined AV and in\n37 cases from NIR photometry. In the remaining 61 cases NH\nwas treated as a free fit parameter. Out of these 61 cases, independent estimates of extinction were available from optical and\nNIR data in 21 and 3 cases respectively, but our algorithm (or,\nfor sources #97 and #127, our choice) preferred the spectral fit\nwith free NH . We examine these cases more in detail to assess\nthe ambiguities in the model fits and the consequences on the\nderived X-ray fluxes.\nFigure 10 illustrates one of such cases: source #375. Here\nthe extinction determined from the 1T (kT=1.3keV) spectral\nfit (90% confidence interval: NH < 2 1020 cm\u22122 ) is lower than\nthat estimated from the AV (9 1020 cm\u22122 ). Fixing the NH to that\nvalue yields an unsatisfactory isothermal fit. We note however\nthat adding to the spectral model a second cool isothermal component (kT = 0.25kev), a good fit can be obtained even fixing\nthe NH . This is a quite typical example of the degeneracy in the\nfitting of sources with low/moderate statistics. We can estimate\nthe uncertainty in the X-ray unabsorbed fluxes derived from the\nspectral fits due to this degeneracy as the difference between the\nfluxes derived from the two acceptable fits: for source #375 for\nexample this is \u223c 0.13dex. More in general, acceptable fits with\nNH fixed to the optical/NIR values could be obtains in 22 of the\n24 cases in which our procedure preferred the spectral fit with\nfree NH . In five cases12 , among which that described above,\nin order to conciliate the observed spectra with the optical extinction, an additional cool thermal component (kT=0.22-0.34)\nwould be required to compensate for the higher NH . If for these\nfive sources the true NH were the optically derived ones, by\nchoosing the 1T fit with free (lower) NH we are underestimating the unabsorbed fluxes by 0.14-0.37dex (mean 0.2dex). For\nthe other 17 sources, fixing the NH would not require an additional component: reasonable fits (n.p.> 5%) were obtained\neven with the same models (1T in 16 cases, 2Tab for source\n#187). In 10 of these 17 cases the adopted fits with free NH\nresult in smaller absorptions and slightly hotter (0.2-0.3keV)\ntemperatures (the cool temperature for #187), while the opposite happens in the other 7 cases. Had we fixed the NH to the\noptical values in these 17 cases we would have obtained unabsorbed fluxes on average \u223c0.03dex larger and always within\n0.20dex (in either direction) of the adopted ones.\nFrom this discussion of the 22 cases with most ambiguous extinctions (\u223c 14% of the sources for which we have optical/NIR NH ), we conclude that: a) typical uncertainties in the\nwith unconstrained uncertainties) to 1T models (p=97% & p=56%,\nkT = 4.7 keV & kT = 3.5 keV).\n12\nSources #190, #340, #352, #375, #391\n\n\f12\n\nE.

Adopting the optical NH (1.8\u00d71021) would result in\nan unabsorbed flux only 0.07dex larger with respect to that ob21\ntained leaving NH as a free fit parameter (NH = 0.590.78\n0.16 \u00d710 ).\nSource #71 is a more interesting case.

The discrepancy is highly significant and\nindependent of the considered spectral model. We note that the\ndetected emission from this source is dominated by a powerful\nflare, with peak count rate \u223c100 times that before and after the\nflare. A possible scenario to explain the high absorption might\ninvolve a solar-like coronal mass ejection associated with the\nflare, providing the additional absorbing material. Such an hypothesis has been formulated by Favata & Schmitt (1999) to\nexplain a more modest increase in NH during a powerful flare\nobserved on Algol.\nFurther discussion of physical interpretation of spectral fit\nresults is deferred to \u00a76.\n\nFig. 10.

X-ray luminosities\nExtinction corrected X-ray luminosities in the [0.5-7.0]keV\nband were estimated for all sources for which an indication of\nextinction was available.

(2004). Independent photometry and spectral types are available\nfrom Rebull et al. (2002), Lamm et al. (2004) and Dahm & Simon\n(2005). Rc \u2212 Ic ranges between 0.55 and 0.62 and spectral types between G9 and K2.

For the fainter sources, for which spectral fits were not\nperformed, we derived a count-rate to unabsorbed flux conversion factors using the results of the spectral fits for the brighter\nstars. Figure 12 shows, for these latter sample, the run of the\nflux/rate ratio vs. NH . Different symbols indicate different origins of the absorption values (see previous section). We then\nperformed polynomial fits to the data points for the whole sample, for the 56 sources with more than 300 counts and for the\n59 sources with less 100 counts. Results are shown in fig. 12.\nBecause the sources for which we want to determine fluxes\n\n\fE. Flaccomio et al.: ACIS-I observations of NGC 2264\n\nFig. 11. Some as figure 10 for source #71. In this case we plot the 1T\nmodel with free NH and the 2T model with NH fixed to the optical\nvalue. Note how even adding a second component, it is impossible to\nreconcile the observed spectrum with the NH implied by the optical\nabsorption and a standard absorption law.\n\nhave <50 counts, we adopt the latter fit as our relation between\nNH and the conversion factor:\nlog\n\nF X (u)\n= 58.62 \u2212 6.942 \u00d7 log NH + 0.1724 \u00d7 (log NH )2 (1)\nCt.Rate\n\nWhere the units are ergs cm\u22122 . The 1\u03c3 dispersion of the\ndata-points around this relation is 0.1 dex, which can be taken\nas an upper limit to the error on the source flux introduced by\nignoring the spectral shape of faint sources. From the observed\ncount-rates we thus estimated fluxes for 127 X-ray sources with\n<50 counts and with NH estimates coming from either the AV\nor the JHK photometry. The gray histogram in figure 12 shows\nthe distribution of NH for these sources. Results are reported in\ntable 1. Note that we do not quote X-ray fluxes for faint sources\nwithout an independent extinction estimate. Upper limit fluxes\nfor 425 X-ray undetected stars in the ACIS FOV and with an\nabsorption estimate (out of a total of 1463) were similarly computed from the upper-limits to the count rates.\n\n5. Results - Membership\nIn this section we define a sample of 491 likely NGC 2264\nmembers within the FOV of our ACIS observation. X-ray\nsources account for 408 objects while the remaining 83 are selected on the basis of the strength of H\u03b1 line and of optical variability as described in \u00a73.2. The likely members are indicated\nin table 3 by an asterisk following the identification number.\nWe first consider the possibility of extragalactic contamination\nand then discuss separately the nature of X-ray sources with\nand without optical/NIR counterparts.\n\n13\n\nFig. 12. Count-rate to unabsorbed flux conversion factor as a function\nof NH as derived from spectral fits. Various symbols refer to spectral\nfits in which NH was treated as a free parameter, fixed to the value\nderived from the optical AV or to that determined from the NIR photometry. The three curves indicate polynomial fits to the data obtained\nfor the whole sample of 199 sources and for subsamples of sources\nwith less than 100 counts (59 sources) or more than 300 counts (56\nsources). The gray histogram (vertical scale on the right hand side)\nshows the distribution of absorption values, derived from the AV or\nthe NIR CCD, of X-ray sources with less than 50 counts, for which\ncount-rate to flux conversion factor was determined using the polynomial fit to faint sources (<100 counts, dotted curve).\n\n5.1. Extragalactic X-ray sources\nExtragalactic contamination is expected only among X-ray\nsources that lack an optical and/or NIR counterpart. We reach\nthis conclusion by considering the 489 ACIS sources of likely\nnon stellar origin detected in the Chandra Deep Field North\n(CDFN; Alexander et al., 2003; Barger et al., 2003)14. After\ndefining, for each CDFN source, random positions in our FOV,\nwe compared their observed count rates with upper limits computed from our ACIS data at those positions (see \u00a73.1). We then\nselected CDFN sources that would have been detected with our\nexposure: a total of 139 \u00b1 3 objects15 . Next, we compared the\npositions of these simulated CDFN AGNs in the optical (I vs.\nR-I) and NIR (H vs. H-K) color-magnitude diagrams16 with\nthose of the X-ray sources in the NGC 2264 exposure that could\nbe placed in the same diagrams. These plots show that AGNs\nare on average considerably fainter than our identified X-ray\nsources that can be placed in either of these diagrams and only\ntwo or three of the AGNs that we could have detected occupy\npositions that overlap with the loci where our X-ray sources\nare found. We note moreover that in this comparison we have\n14\n\nWe excluded 14 sources identified as stars by Barger et al. (2003).\nMean value and 1\u03c3 uncertainty result from repeating the experiment 10 times, varying the position of simulated extragalactic sources.\n16\nThe NIR photometry of the CDFN sources was taken from 2Mass.\n15\n\n\f14\n\nE. Flaccomio et al.: ACIS-I observations of NGC 2264\n\ntotally neglected the effect of extinction. Because of the dark\ncloud in our line of sight, the number of AGNs we are sensible\nto is surely much reduced with respect to the above estimate.\nMoreover the optical and NIR luminosities of AGNs would\nalso be considerably reduced. We therefore conclude that the\ncontamination of AGNs to the sample of X-ray selected likely\nmembers with optical/NIR identification is negligible.\n\n5.2. X-ray sources with optical/NIR counterparts\nIn figure 3 we showed the optical CMD for the 300 X-ray\nsources that can be placed in such a diagram and for the 83\nother undetected likely members discussed in \u00a73.2. Note that\nthe X-ray sources (filled symbols) are for the most part found\nin the locus expected for NGC 2264 members (i.e. the previously defined cluster locus). However some X-ray sources lie\nbelow that locus, their position being compatible with that expected for MS foreground stars. Very few, if any, of the X-ray\nsources in this diagram may be background MS stars, which\nare expected to lie below the 1Gyr isochrone. In order to reduce\ncontamination in the sample of likely members to a minimum,\nwe exclude X-ray sources that lie outside the cluster locus, i.e.\nbelow 107.1 Myr isochrone and to the right of the 0.8M\u2299 evolutionary track. We make an exception for two sources: #305\n(I=17.28, R-I=0.98), associated with the IRAS source IRS1, classified as a Class I object by Margulis et al. (1989) but\nmore recently suggested to be a deeply embedded B star in a\nmore evolved evolutionary stage (Schreyer et al., 2003)17; #309\n(I=16.45, R-I=0.76), a known member, being indeed the peculiar and well studied accreting binary system KH 15D (e.g.\nHamilton et al., 2005; Herbst & Moran, 2005; Dahm & Simon,\n2005). The 8 sources that lie to the right of the 0.1M\u2299 track are\nconsidered likely members, either of very low (sub)stellar mass\nor very absorbed. Lacking AV values from optical spectra, we\ncan check these two possibilities using our X-ray data and the\nJHK photometry. Out of these 8 sources, 4 (#125, #192, #251,\n#273) are highly absorbed as indicated by their X-ray spectra\n(or hardness ratios) and/or their positions in the J-H vs. H-K\ndiagram. Other three sources (#215, #316, #358) however appear to have negligible absorption and are good candidates for\ndetected brown dwarfs.\nOnly 10 X-ray sources (out of 300) are excluded as members because incompatible with our cluster locus in the optical\nCMD and might be associated with field stars18 . Among them\nonly one (source #258, an X-ray faint LX /Lbol = \u22124.8 and soft\nG5 star) could be placed in the HR diagram of figure 5, and is\nthere placed on the 100Myr isochrone. Although we exclude\nthese 10 sources from our sample of likely members, some of\nthem might actually be members: i) in figure 3 six very likely\nmembers, 5 undetected and one detected CTTSs, are found below the cluster locus. This indicates that some members do\nhave position in the optical CMD that differ from the expectations; ii) the spatial distribution of these 10 sources (figure\n13, squares+dot symbols) is similar to that of cluster mem22\n(90% confidence\nThe ACIS spectrum indicates NH = 4.88.9\n3.2 10\ninterval), corresponding to AV = 20 \u2212 56.\n18\n#7, #51, #110, #128, #130, #171, #224, #248, #258, and #267.\n17\n\nbers, and not uniform as expected from foreground stars; iii)\nthe ACIS spectra and hardness ratios indicate that 5 of these\nsources suffer high extinction in the X-ray band, which is incompatible with foreground MS star (but not with background\ngiants).\nWe now statistically estimate the number of foreground\nstars that, present in our FOV and detected by ACIS, contaminate our list of 290 (=300-10) X-ray detected cluster-locus candidate members, as well as the 10 X-ray sources outside of the\ncluster locus. We considered the volume-limited stellar samples of the NEXXUS survey (Schmitt & Liefke, 2004), extracting from it a near-complete sample of stars of spectral types\nF to M within 6 pc from the Sun. These stars are optically\nwell characterized and have known distances and X-ray luminosities as measured with ROSAT. We estimated the number\nof foreground stars, N f g , in our FOV assuming that the spatial\ndensity of field stars in the direction of NGC 2264 is uniform\nand equal to that in the solar neighborhood19. We next randomly drew N f g stars from the NEXXUS sample and assigned\nthem random distances, d, in the range [0-760]pc, according to\nan uniform stellar density. With these distances and assuming\nan isothermal X-ray spectrum with kT=0.3 keV, we converted\nthe NEXXUS X-ray luminosities to ACIS count rates using an\nNH -dependent conversion factor calculated with the \"Portable,\nInteractive Multi-Mission Simulator\" (PIMMS). The hydrogen\ncolumn density toward each star was estimated as \u03c1 \u00d7 d, where\nthe volume density \u03c1 was set to 0.3 cm\u22123 and the distance is\nexpressed in cm20 . We finally compared these simulated countrates with upper limits estimated at random positions in the\nACIS FOV estimated using PWDetect (\u00a73.1). This simulation\nwas repeated 100 times, varying the sample of NEXXUS stars\nand their position in space. On average, the sample of foreground stars that we would have detected counts 20 stars, 15 of\nwhich should fall in the cluster locus and 5 outside of it. About\nhalf of the 10 stars outside the cluster locus are thus expected to\nbe cluster members, thus reinforcing the arguments given in the\nprevious paragraph. Within the cluster locus, only 5% (15/290)\nof the X-ray sources are estimated to be non-members21. Given\nthat eighty of the X-ray sources in the cluster locus had not\nbeen previously selected as likely members because of either\ntheir H\u03b1 emission or optical variability, we estimate that our\nsample contains \u223c 65 new optically visible members.\nFifty-one more X-ray sources were identified with optical\nor NIR objects but could not be placed in the optical CMD (14\nhave I magnitudes but no R, 37 are only detected in 2MASS).\nExtending the previous result and because we can exclude an\nextragalactic nature for these sources, we consider these stars\nas additional candidate members. Only four of them had previous indication of membership from H\u03b1 or optical variability.\n19\nThis is justified by the low equatorial longitude of NGC 2264:\n2.2 deg.\n20\nWith the chosen value of \u03c1, taking NH /AV = 1.6 1021 and d=760pc\n(the assumed distance of NGC 2264), we obtain AV =0.44, in agreement with the median of values measured for NGC 2264 members.\n21\nThe fraction of non-members is expected to be higher among Xray sources with M/M\u2299 > 1 and ages \u223c 107 yr.\n\n\fE.

Empty\ncircles with size indicating source statistics (see legend): unidentified\nX-ray sources.\n\n5.3. Sources with no optical/NIR counterpart\nSixty-seven ACIS sources are not identified with any object\nlisted in the full-field optical/NIR catalogs we have considered22 . None of them was detected by Flaccomio et al. (2000)\nwith the ROSAT HRI23 . With respect to identified sources, they\nhave significantly fewer counts. Fifteen non identified sources\nhave detection significance < 5.0\u03c3 and the 10 expected spurious detections (cf. \u00a72.3) will be most likely found in this group.\nNine have more than 50 counts and were subject to spectral\nanalysis.\nAs discussed in \u00a75.1, depending on the optical depth of the\nbackground cloud, a number of AGNs are expected to be detected in our FOV and will be found among the non-identified\nsources. It is therefore reasonable to ask whether the characteristics of our sources without counterparts are compatible with\nan AGN nature. The X-ray spectra of AGNs should be rather\nhard and well fit by power law models with indexes between\n\u223c0.9 and \u223c1.924 . Their lightcurves should be constant or slowly\n22\n\nFour of these X-ray sources were actually identified with MIR\nand/or mm sources in \u00a73.3. Because these catalogs are not spatially\ncomplete, for uniformity we here treat them as unidentified.\n23\nIn table 3, due to the large uncertainty of the HRI positions, our\nACIS source # 376 is associated with HRI source 138; the HRI source\nis however closer to the brighter ACIS source #375, with which it is\nmost likely associated.\n24\n80% interval of the power indexes reported by Alexander et al.\n(2003) for the sources in the CDFN that we would have detected in\nour ACIS data and for which the 1\u03c3 uncertainty in the index is lower\nthan 0.1.\n\n15\n\nvarying. They should be distributed uniformly in space, or anticorrelated with the cloud optical depth. With respect to this\nlatter point, figure 13 shows the spatial distribution of several\nclasses of objects: circles of three different sizes indicate Xray sources without counterparts in three source count ranges.\nOther X-ray sources are shown with black dots, while all the\nother objects in our master catalog are shown in gray. These\nlatter are for the most part background field stars and their\ndensity is a good indicator of the optical depth of the molecular cloud. Note how the X-ray sources with counterparts, i.e.\nlikely members, lie preferentially in front of or close to the\ncloud and have an highly structured distribution (c.f., Lamm\net al., 2004), with at least two concentrations in the south and\ntoward the field center, corresponding to two well known embedded sub-clusters roughly centered on IRS 1 (Allen's source,\ne.g. Schreyer et al., 2003) and IRS 2 respectively (e.g. Williams\n& Garland 2002).\nWe first discuss the nine unidentified sources with more\nthan 50 counts: two of them (#244, #327), located in the IRS 1\nand IRS 2 regions, show distinct long lasting flares (fig. 14)\nand are therefore most likely PMS stars or YSOs. As discussed\nin \u00a73.3, source #244 is actually identified with a SPITZER\nsource and, although missing in the 2MASS catalog, it is rather\nbright in K. The spectra of the other seven are compatible\nwith both isothermal models and power law models. Assuming\nisothermal models, they have, with respect to the 190 sources\nwith counterparts and >50 counts, higher extinctions and temperatures (c.f. fig. 15): the median NH is 2.7 1022 cm\u22122 , vs.\n7 1020 cm\u22122 and the median kT is 13.7 keV vs. 1.33 keV.\nNeither the NH nor the kT are incompatible with those of\nother highly extinct X-ray sources with counterparts (cf. fig.\n15), which we have argued are most likely not AGNs. Due\nto the high extinction, the LX of these sources (if at the distance of NGC 2264) is also high: median log LX = 30.4 vs.\nlog LX = 29.8. If instead we assume the correct models are\npower laws, the best fit indexes range between 0.252.0\n\u22120.23 and\n4.16.5\n2.5 (median 1.6). The two flaring sources have power indexes\nwith 90% confidence above the range expected for AGNs and\nthe same is true also for source # 162 (\u0393 = 4.16.5\n2.5 ), which also\nlies in the IRS 2 region and is therefore likely to be a star (the\nisothermal fit yield a rather common kT = 1.27keV). Two more\n(# 228, # 274) of the remaining six objects, although with rather\nhard and absorbed spectra, are clustered around IRS 2 and are\ntherefore also likely to be YSOs. We thus conclude that 50% (5\nout of 9) or more of the unidentified sources with more than 50\ncounts are likely to be stars.\nTurning to the remaining 58 sources with less than 50\ncounts, two show flares (#152 and #376, fig. 14) and are likely\nto be stars. The others, although maybe a little less spatially\nconcentrated than sources with counterparts, seem to follow a\nsimilar distribution in the sky. We conclude that, rather qualitatively, a sizable fraction (of the order of 50%) of them are associated with NGC 2264. This conclusion is corroborated by the\ndistribution of unidentified sources in the HR1 vs. HR2 hardness ratio diagram, figure 16. We show for reference a grid of\nexpected loci for absorbed isothermal spectra and the region\nwhere power law sources with indexes between 0.9 and 1.9\nshould lie. Both grids are computed using PIMMS. We note\n\n\f16\n\nE. Flaccomio et al.: ACIS-I observations of NGC 2264\n\nular cloud. They certainly deserve to be followed up with more\nsensitive IR observations.\n\n6. Results - X-ray activity\n\nFig. 14. Lightcurves for four \"flaring\" sources (#152, #244, #327\nand #376) with no optical/IR counterpart. The background subtracted\ncount rate is plotted vs. the time since the beginning of the observation. Source number, net counts and the result of the KS variability\ntest are given in the upper part of each panel.\n\nthat both HR1 (most sensitive to NH ) and HR2 (most sensitive to kT) are on average significantly different for sources\nwith and without counterparts, indicating that non-identified\nsources are on average characterized by hotter and more absorbed emission. However, the region occupied by about half\nof the unidentified sources is also occupied by a number of absorbed sources with counterparts, i.e. likely members, while the\nrest appears to be significantly hotter and possibly compatible\nwith the expected AGN locus.\nIn conclusion, our 67 sources lacking optical/NIR counterparts are good candidates for new embedded members. Given\ntheir absorption these are rather luminous X-ray sources. They\nare thus unlikely to be low mass stars that have escaped optical/NIR detection because intrinsically fainter than the detection limit. Given the small dependency of LX /Lbol on mass\n(Flaccomio et al., 2003a; Preibisch et al., 2005), low mass\nstars are indeed usually faint in X-rays. Non-identified sources\nmight be embedded protostars (class I and class 0 objects),\nmedium/high mass very obscured PMS members of NGC 2264\nor extragalactic objects shining through the background molec-\n\nOur data indicate that the source of X-ray emission in\nNGC 2264 low mass members is hot (0.3-10 keV) thermal\nplasma. The X-ray emission is highly variable in time, the\nmost prominent phenomena being impulsive flares due to magnetic reconnection events. These observations fit well with a\nsolar-like picture of coronal emission and are quite usual for\nPMS stars. They are, for example, in qualitative agreement with\nthose recently reported for the \u223c1Myr old stars in the ONC by\nthe COUP collaboration (Preibisch et al., 2005). The spectral\nand temporal characteristics of PMS stars are, broadly speaking, also similar to those of active MS stars, e.g. in the young\nPleiades cluster. The most striking differences with respect to\nMS stars are the X-ray luminosities and the plasma temperatures, both of which are usually found to be higher. As for LX\nwe note that the fractional X-ray luminosities (LX /Lbol ) are, in\nPMS stars, comparable or smaller than those of saturated MS\nstars. Therefore, the higher LX can be explained by the almost\nsaturated emission of PMS stars and by their larger bolometric\nluminosities. The higher temperatures might instead indicate\na difference in the heating mechanism and/or, a larger contribution to the average flux of flares with hard spectra. At least\nthree questions remain open. First and foremost, the nature of\nthe ultimate mechanism that sustains PMS coronae. While for\npartially convective MS stars this is identified with the \u03b1 \u2212 \u03c9\ndynamo thanks to the observed relation between activity and\nstellar rotation, no such evidence is available for PMS stars\n(Flaccomio et al., 2003a; Preibisch et al., 2005; Rebull et al.,\n2006). Second, the extent and geometry of coronae, and in particular the possibility of interactions of plasma filled magnetic\nstructures with circumstellar disks (Favata et al., 2005; Jardine\net al., 2006). Third, the role of accretion and outflows: soft\nX-ray emission has been inferred to originate both at the interface between the accretion flow and the photosphere, and\nwithin the stellar jets (Kastner et al., 2002; Bally et al., 2003).\nIn this section we now use our data to statistically investigate\nthe dependence of activity, in terms of emission level, variability and spectra, on the stellar and circumstellar characteristics.\nFirst however we discuss more in detail the results of our Xray spectral analysis, with respect to plasma temperatures and\nabsorption values.\nFigure 15 shows the plasma temperature as a function of absorption for all the sources with spectral fits and for which we\nadopted isothermal models. Figure 17 similarly shows the two\nbest-fit plasma temperatures of sources for which we adopted\n2T models. First of all we note that 2T models were required\nonly for log NH < 21.5, likely because higher column densities\nabsorb the cool component to the extent that it becomes unobservable. Moreover, in the NH range covered by both models, 2T models were statistically favored in sources with higher\nstatistics while low statistic sources were in most cases successfully fit with a single plasma component with temperature\nroughly intermediate between those of the two components in\n2T models. For 1T models we also note a certain correlation be-\n\n\fE. Flaccomio et al.: ACIS-I observations of NGC 2264\n\ntween kT and NH (fig. 15). While a positive slope of the lower\nenvelope of the datapoints is easily explained as a selection effect, this is not the case for the upper envelope. The paucity of\nsources with low NH and high kT indicates that the X-ray emitting plasma of highly extinct sources is intrinsically hotter than\nthat of optically revealed PMS stars. These hot, highly extinct\nsources are good candidates for embedded Class 0/I protostars,\nwhich have already been suggested to have harder X-ray spectra (Imanishi et al., 2001).\nFigure 18 shows, for 2T models, the run of kT 1 and kT 2\nwith stellar mass. Like for the two previously discussed plots,\nwe also show for reference the temperatures obtained by the\nCOUP collaboration (Preibisch et al., 2005) for \u223c1Myr old\nstars in the ONC25 . With respect to the ONC, in NGC 2264\ntemperatures appear to be lower on average. This could indicate that at \u223c 3Myr, the hot flaring component of the X-ray\nemission has become less important. It could also result from\na lower fraction of CTTSs given that, as we note below (\u00a76.1),\nCTTS tend to have slightly higher plasma temperatures with\nrespect to WTTS.\nWe also note that, with respect to the COUP data, the temperatures that we find for the two isothermal components show\na larger scatter. This could be due to: i) larger uncertainties\nin the NGC 2264 results because of the shorter exposure time\nand longer distance with respect to the ONC; ii) the shorter\nexposure time resulting in a larger influence of spectral time\nvariability on the time averaged spectra; iii) a real evolutionary effect (e.g. most ONC stars are CTTS while in NGC 2264\nwe observe a more varied mixture of CTTS and WTTS); iv)\nthe existence of an additional thermal component that is only\nsometimes present and/or revealed by the spectral fitting process. In this respect figures 17 and 18 evidence, for sources fit\nwith 2T models, an interesting feature: an apparent separation\nof the temperatures in two branches, more evident for the cool\nisothermal component. Taking kT 1 = 0.5 keV as the dividing\nline between the two branches, we have 23 and 29 sources in\nthe cool and hot branch respectively. The hot branch has median kT 1 and kT 2 of 0.8 and 3.6 keV respectively, roughly coincident with the temperatures of most COUP sources. The cool\nbranch has median kT 1 and kT 2 of 0.3 and 1.3keV respectively.\nNoting that this latter median kT 2 is similar to the temperatures found for sources that were successfully fit by 1T models, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the EM distributions\nof these sources have three peaks: one corresponding to the\ncool \u223c 0.3keV component that is not present and/or visible for\nsources in the hot branch, and two peaks at hotter temperatures (i.e. \u223c 0.8 and \u223c 3.6keV) that are however well represented by an isothermal component with intermediate temperatures. Given the limited statistics of our sources, three component spectral models, although physically reasonable, are not\nneeded and would therefore remain unconstrained by the data.\nAs for the physical origin of the two branches, we note that\nwith respect to the hot branch, stars in the cool branch have\n\n17\n\nFig. 15. Large black symbols: kT vs. NH for NGC 2264 sources for\nwhich isothermal models were adopted. We distinguish (see legend)\nCTTS and WTTS, stars that are identified with optical and/or NIR\nsources but for which the PMS class is unknown, and X-ray sources\nthat are not identified with any known optical/NIR object. Note that\nstars with log NH < 20.1 have been shifted to that value and their\nhorizontal position slightly randomized so that the symbols do not\noverlap completely. The small gray circles show for comparison the\ntwo temperatures derived by Getman et al. (2005) for a sample of 566\nONC members observed by the COUP collaboration.\n\nlower counts (median counts 270 vs. 630), are significantly less\nvariable according to the KS test (variability fraction 30% vs.\n66%, at the 1% confidence level) and are slightly more likely\nto be CTTS (CTTS fraction: 33% vs. 23%). We note that the\ndifference in variability fractions is unlikely to be explained by\nstatistics alone (c.f. fig 6 and 7). If the kT 2 \u223c3keV component\nis due to flaring, it is then possible that the kT 1 \u223c 0.3keV component becomes detectable preferentially when flaring is absent and therefore the hot component is suppressed. This soft\nemission might be physically assimilated to the X-ray emission\nfrom the solar corona. This latter would indeed show temperatures similar to 0.3keV if analyzed with ASCA SIS (c.f. Table 1\nin Orlando et al., 2001), an instrument with response similar to\nACIS. The emission measures we derive for the \u223c0.3keV component of our NGC 2264 sources, (3.1 \u00d7 1052 \u2212 1.6 \u00d7 1054 cm\u22123 )\nalthough much larger than those estimated for the Sun, could\nstill be explained by much larger filling factors (\u223c 1) and/or\nlarger scale heights of the densest structures (i.e. active region\ncores).\n\n6.1. Activity in CTTS and WTTS\n25\n\nNote that the COUP observations, obtained with Chandra ACIS,\nwas 850ksec long. The temperatures are thus derived from a spectrum\nthat has been integrated in time over a period that is 8.5 times longer\nthan that of our NGC 2264 observation\n\nComparing the plasma temperatures of CTTS and WTTS that\nare well fit by a single temperature model (37 CTTS, 58\nWTTS) we learn that the former are statistically hotter (me-\n\n\f18\n\nE.

Values of kTs and log NH are given\non the left and top/bottom of the grid.

A similar comparison for the\ntwo plasma temperatures of stars that required a 2T spectral\nmodel (12 CTTS and 31 WTTS) is inconclusive, possibly also\nbecause of the lower number of stars. However we have noted\nabove that CTTS appear to be more common among stars with\nlow values of kT 1 (fig. 17). In particular, the three stars with the\nlowest kT 1 are all CTTS. Figure 19 shows the ACIS spectra for\nthese three sources, #17, #111 and #183. The two thermal components of the best fit model are shown separately and the temperatures and absorption are reported from table 6. The most\nstriking case appears to be source #183, which has the highest kT 1 (0.14keV) and shows a clear double peaked spectrum.\nThe emission measure (EM) of the cool plasma is estimated\nto be 5.7 \u00d7 1053 cm\u22123 . The other two sources have lower kT\nand higher EMs (#17: kT 1 = 0.09keV, EM = 2.3 \u00d7 1054 cm\u22123 ;\n#111: kT 1 = 0.12keV, EM = 1.2\u00d71054 cm\u22123 ). We note also that\namong the three sources #183 has the largest H\u03b1 line equivalent\nwidth: 27.9 vs. 10.9 and 18.2 for #17 and #111.\nAs noted in the previous section, low kT 1 values are usually\nassociated with low kT 2 . For the three CTTS just discussed for\nexample the kT 2 values, 0.87-0.95keV, are among the lowest\nobserved and very similar to the cool component for the majority of PMS stars. This suggests that the ultra-cold compo-\n\nFig. 17. kT 1 and kT 2 as a function of NH for sources for which 2T\nspectral fits were adopted. The results for NGC 2264 presented in this\npaper are shown as larger symbols, filled ones for the cool component\ntemperature and empty ones for the hot component. Stars, circles and\nsquares indicate CTTS, WTTS and unclassified stars respectively. The\nsmall gray circles show for comparison the two temperatures derived\nby Getman et al.

CTTS thus appear to possess both warmer and cooler\nplasma than WTTS. If this results is confirmed with more\nstatistical significance by further observations, it could imply\nthat the accretion process results in, on one hand, more frequent/energetic flares and, on the other hand, a very cool X-ray\nplasma produced in the accretion shock (cf. the cases of TW\nHydrae and BP Tau: Kastner et al. 2002; Stelzer & Schmitt\n2004; Schmitt et al. 2005).\nWe now investigate the X-ray activity levels (LX and\nLX /Lbol ) as a function of bolometric luminosity, stellar mass\nand accretion properties for the subsample of stars for which\nstellar masses were derived by placement in the theoretical HR\ndiagram and interpolation of the SDF tracks (160 X-ray detected stars, excluding one possible non-member and two stars\noutside the tracks). For this investigation we also include upper\nlimits for 16 X-ray undetected likely members (empty symbols in figure 5). Note that a more exhaustive account of the\nrelation between activity and stellar properties, using the X-ray\ndata presented here in conjunction with those of Ram\u0131\u0301rez et al.\n(2004a) for another field in NGC 2264, and those of Ram\u0131\u0301rez\net al.

Symbols and legend as in Figure 18.\n\nter included many more stars than we have here, but with on\naverage more uncertain stellar parameters. Here we take a different approach, focusing only on the NGC 2264 members in\nour FOV that are well characterized optically.\nOur LX -mass scatter plot is shown in figure 20. We observe the commonly found mass-LX correlation (e.g. Rebull\net al., 2006), although with a large spread. The position of\nupper limits indicate that our sensitivity limit is log LX \u223c 29\nergs/s, which appears to correspond to a completeness limit\nin mass at about 0.3-0.4M\u2299. Moreover we note that, at each\nstellar mass for which our sample is reasonably complete,\nCTTS are on average fainter and more scattered with respect to WTTS, confirming the results obtained for ONC stars\n(Flaccomio et al., 2003a; Preibisch et al., 2005). A similar\nplot is shown for LX /Lbol in Figure 21. LX /Lbol appears to\nbe generally high, roughly between 10\u22124 and the saturation\nlevel \u223c 10\u22123.0 . Twenty-two sources actually have measured\nLX /Lbol above the saturation limit. However, a large fraction\nof these, 73%, are variable, a significantly higher variability\nfraction than among sources below the saturation threshold\n(16%). Moreover, most of the sources with the highest values of\nLX /Lbol show large flares, which, if excluded would bring them\nclose or below to the saturation level. Flaccomio et al. (2003a)\nfound evidence for ONC stars of a decrease of LX /Lbol at the\nvery lowest masses. Our sample of stars with mass estimates\nis not complete enough at those masses to study this effect in\ndetail. However, consistently with these results, we do note a\ndecrease in the upper envelope of the LX /Lbol vs. mass relation\nfor M/M\u2299 . 0.3. Considering CTTS and WTTS separately,\nthe difference in activity is less striking in this plot with respect\nto the LX -mass one. However, figure 22 shows, separately for\nthe two PMS classes, the distributions of LX /Lbol , both for the\n\nFig. 19. ACIS spectra of three CTTS with a very low kT 1 .

All the distributions take\ninto account upper limits via the Kaplan-Meier estimator. For\nboth samples, and in particular for the mass restricted one,\n\n\f20\n\nE. Flaccomio et al.: ACIS-I observations of NGC 2264\n\nwe observe that CTTS are less active with respect to WTTS.\nMedian log LX /Lbol values differ by 0.32 and 0.41 dex for the\ntwo subsamples. The statistical significance of the difference\nis confirmed by the five two-sample tests in the ASURV package (Feigelson & Nelson, 1985), giving probabilities that the\nlog LX /Lbol distributions of CTTS and WTTS are taken from\nthe same parent distribution <0.02% for the whole stellar sample and <0.3% for the mass restricted one. We note that this latter result differs from that of Preibisch et al. (2005), who find,\nin the ONC, a statistically significant difference in the activity\nlevels of CTTS and WTTS only for stars in the 0.2-0.5M\u2299 mass\nrange.\nFinally we repeat with our data the correlation analysis between LX and Lbol performed by Preibisch et al. (2005) for\nONC stars classified as CTTS and WTTS. Using the estimation\nmaximization (EM) algorithm in the ASURV package we find\nvery nearly linear correlations between LX and Lbol for the two\nclasses of stars: log LX = (1.02 \u00b1 0.09) log Lbol + 30.21 \u00b1 0.05\nfor WTTS (1\u03c3 dispersion: 0.4 dex) and log LX = (1.02 \u00b1\n0.12) log Lbol + 29.92 \u00b1 0.07 for CTTS (1\u03c3 dispersion: 0.5 dex).\nSimilarly to the ONC case, accreting stars in NGC 2264 thus\nappear to be on average fainter than non accreting ones with\nthe same Lbol (in this case by a factor of 2) and to have slightly\nmore scattered LX values. However we note that the power-law\nslope derived by Preibisch et al. (2005) for accreting stars in\nthe ONC (0.6 \u00b1 0.1) is significantly shallower than that derived\nhere and that in the ONC the 1\u03c3 dispersion of points with respect to the best fit relations appear to be larger: 0.5 vs. 0.4\ndex for WTTS and 0.7 vs. 0.5 for CTTS. The differences might\nbe be interpreted as an evolutionary effect, given that the ONC\nis younger than NGC 2264 (\u223c 1 vs. \u223c 3Myr) and that accretion disks are expected to have evolved significantly in the latter cluster (Flaccomio et al., 2003c). We note however that the\ncomparison between the effects of accretion on X-ray activity\nin the two regions is made uncertain by the different accretion\nindicators used in the two cases, the H\u03b1 and the Ca II equivalent\nwidths for NGC 2264 and the ONC respectively.\n\nFig. 20. log LX vs. mass for likely members placed in the theoretical\nHR diagram.

The legend\ngives the number of detections and upper limits for each of the three\nsubsamples.\n\n6.2. KH 15D\nThe peculiar binary system KH 15D has been the subject of\nmany investigations. Herbst & Moran (2005) in particular, analyzing the same X-ray data discussed here conclude that the\nsystem is a very weak source of X-ray emission for its mass\nand age. They tentatively attribute the low X-ray emission to\nthe high eccentricity of the binary system and/or to the close\nperiastron approach of the two stars, that may either disrupt\nthe stellar magnetosphere and/or adversely affect the stellar dynamo.\nThe X-ray luminosity we derive for KH 15D (our source\n#309), based on 21.6 detected photons, is 1.3 1029 lower than\nthe value reported by Herbst & Moran (2005) by 0.07 dex.\nThis difference is small and within the uncertainties but, given\nthat the two values are derived from the same X-ray data, we\ninvestigated the matter further. The discrepancy can be fully\nexplained by the different estimated number of source photons, 21.6 vs. 22.5, the assumed value of interstellar absorp-\n\nFig. 21. log LX /Lbol vs. mass for the same stars of figure 20.\n\ntion, 9 1020 vs. 2 1020 cm\u22122 , and the assumed source spectrum.26 The 0.07 dex difference in LX however is not partic26\n\nOur NH is based on AV = 0.58, derived here from published\nphotometry and spectral type.

Distribution of log LX /Lbol for WTTS and CTTS (solid and\ndashed lines, respectively). The thick lines refer to the whole sample\nof stars depicted in figure 21; the thin lines to stars more massive than\n0.6M\u2299 . Note how in both cases CTTS are on average less active than\nWTTS.\n\nularly relevant for the physical conclusions regarding the low\nLX of the system. KH 15D in not shown in our LX -mass scatter\nplot (figure 20) because the system is located in the HR diagram below the grid of the evolutionary tracks (figure 5) and\nwe did not derive a mass. Extrapolating the tracks one would\nestimate a mass of 0.6-0.7M\u2299, consistent with the value used\nby Herbst & Moran (2005), 0.6M\u2299 . Thus placing KH 15D in\nthe LX -mass diagram we notice that it would fall below the bulk\nof the other NGC 2264 members, but in an area that is populated by other CTTSs. The value of log LX /Lbol we derive from\nour data, -3.45, is moreover perfectly in line with most of the\nother NGC 2264 members (cf. figure 21). We therefore tend to\nbelieve that, rather than being affected by the peculiar binary\norbits, the low X-ray emission of KH 15D is due to the same\nmechanism that suppresses activity in CTTSs.\n\n6.3. Embedded XMM-Newton sources studied by\nSimon & Dahm (2005)\nSimon & Dahm (2005, hereafter SD05) studied in detail three\nembedded X-ray sources close to IRS 1 (see also \u00a73.3) using\nNH = 5 \u2212 6 1020 cm\u22122 assuming AV /E(B \u2212 V) = 3.1 and depending on\nthe assumed AV /NH ratio in the range 1.6-2.0 1021 . As for the temperature Herbst & Moran (2005) assume solar abundances and kT=2.7keV,\nthe latter based on the uncertain (due to statistics) hardness ratio. The\ncount to flux conversion factor we used (equation 1) was derived from\nsources with 50 to 100 counts, which were fit with APEC models with\nsubsolar abundances and median kT of 1.0 keV. Note that our harness\nratio analysis (c.f. figure 16) actually indicates a very cool spectrum,\nkT\u223c 0.3keV, with large uncertainties.\n\n21\n\nXMM-Newton EPIC data taken in March 2002, i.e. 7 months\nbefore our ACIS exposure. All the three sources are retrieved in\nour data and we now compare the results with respect to spectral characteristics, variability and average X-ray luminosities.\nEPIC source #26 (our source #194) was the most stable of\nthe three sources. The lightcurves were constant in both observations; the absorption was identical, NH = 2.6 1022 cm\u22122 ; and\nthe kT was also the same within uncertainties27: 2.09 \u00b1 0.23\nkeV (EPIC) vs. kT=2.44.8\n1.5 keV (ACIS). The X-ray luminosity\nhowever, when corrected for the different energy band used by\nSD05 (1-10keV vs. our 0.5-7keV) and the different assumed\ndistance (d=800pc, vs. our 760pc) seems to have dropped by a\nfactor \u223c 2 between the two observations.\nThe EPIC source #10 (our source #141) showed a dramatic\nflare toward the end of SD05's exposure with the peak count\nrate reaching \u223c100 times brighter than the quiescent emission\nbefore the flare. Our lightcurve is instead compatible with constant emission. DS05 analyzed the spectrum during the flare,\nwhile we report results for the average spectrum, which is however built from only \u223c 65 photons. There is no evidence of\nvariation in the absorption: DS05 find NH = 2.26 \u00b1 0.16 1022\n22\ncm\u22122 vs. our 2.64.3\ncm\u22122 . The temperatures are how1.5 10\never very different owing to the bright flare in the EPIC data:\nkT=12.94 \u00b1 3.30 keV vs. kT=2.06.1\n1.0 keV. The X-ray luminosities are also very different, with the SD05 value (LX = 32.37)\nabout 2 dex larger than the value obtained from our analysis\nand corrected for the different bands and distances. It is therefore likely that we observed the source in a state similar to the\npre-flare state in the SD05 data.\nFinally, the lightcurve of EPIC source #1 (our source #296)\nshowed, during the XMM exposure, a remarkable rise in count\nrate by a factor \u2265 7 in about 8 ksec, and then began what appears as a slow decay for the remaining 30 ksec of the observation. An isothermal spectral fit gave a very high absorption,\nNH = 9.32\u00b10.15 1022 cm\u22122 , temperature, kT=10.38\u00b10.54 keV,\nand total luminosity LX = 1.1 1033 ergs s\u22121 (in the 1-10keV\nband). From our ACIS data we derive a two order of magnitude\nsmaller luminosity LX = 1.1 1031 , a somewhat colder plasma,\n2.4\n22\nkT=4.89.6\n3.0 keV and a 5-fold lower absorption NH = 1.91.6 10\n\u22122\ncm . The lightcurve indicate a roughly linear decay of the\ncount rate during the 100ksec of our observation from \u223c 6\ncts ksec\u22121 to \u223c 2 cts ksec\u22121 . We note that our value of NH\n(90% confidence interval corresponding to AV = 10 \u2212 15) is\nroughly in agreement with the absorption SD05 derived for the\nsource from NIR spectroscopy (AV = 15 \u2212 20) and, contrary to\nthe value observed during the XMM-Newton exposure, does not\nimply a gas-to-dust ratio larger than in the interstellar medium.\nWe speculate that the high absorption seen by SD05 is due to a\nsolar-like CME associated with the flare as also speculated for\nour source #71 in \u00a74.2.\n\n7.

Taking\ninto account the small estimated contamination from field stars,\nwe have thus increased the known member census of the region\nby about 100 objects, mostly very low mass stars and including some candidate brown dwarfs. A further group of 10 Xray sources, excluded from the member sample because their\nposition in the optical CMD is discrepant with the cluster locus, is also likely to include members. Moreover, among the 67\nsources with no optical/NIR counterparts, we argue that about\nhalf are previously unrecognized embedded members and good\ncandidates for X-ray detected Class 0/I sources. The other half\nis instead likely associated with extragalactic objects. The coming SPITZER data, will be very useful to clarify the nature of\neach source and will allow a systematic study of X-ray activity\nin the protostellar phase.\nWe determined X-ray unabsorbed fluxes and luminosities\nfor 326 sources for which absorption could be estimated, either\nfrom the X-ray spectra, from optical spectral types and photometry (AV ) or from NIR photometry. With the aim of shedding light on PMS X-ray activity, we then performed a detailed\nstudy of X-ray lightcurves and spectra, and studied the relation between the properties of X-ray emitting plasma and stellar/circumstellar characteristics. We confirm several previous\nfindings: X-ray luminosity is related to bolometric luminosity\nand to stellar mass; LX /Lbol is on average high and rather independent of mass, other than for a possible drop at \u223c 2M\u2299\nand a shallow decrease for M/M\u2299 . 0.3. The mass-LX relation appears to be better defined for WTTS than for CTTS, and\nCTTS have on average lower activity levels at any given bolometric luminosity and mass. We found tentative evidence that\nCTTS are more time variable with respect to WTTS, which\nmight be related to the time-variable nature of the accretion\nprocess if this latter plays a role in the X-ray emission. With\nrespect to spectral characteristics, the plasma on CTTS is on\naverage slightly hotter than on WTTS, a finding possibly related to the higher variability of CTTS. However, we also observe that the sources with the coolest plasma are preferentially CTTS. Three CTTSs in particular appear to have plasma\nat \u223c 0.1 \u2212 0.2keV, i.e. comparable with the temperatures expected for plasma heated by accretion shocks, as observed on\nTW Hydrae (kT \u223c 0.25keV, Kastner et al., 2002; Stelzer &\nSchmitt, 2004). The estimated emission measures of this cool\nplasma is between 4 and 17 times larger than on TW Hydrae\n(EM = 1.3 \u00d7 1053 cm\u22123 ), maybe as a result of the expected\nlarger accretion rates of NGC 2264 stars. These results, taken\nas a whole, reinforce the mounting evidence that activity in\nlow mass PMS stars, while generally similar to that of saturated MS stars, is significantly affected by mass accretion. This\ninfluence has at least two aspects: accretion is on one hand a\npositive source of very soft X-ray emission produced in the accretion shock. On the other hand it reduces the average energy\n\noutput of coronae and makes the emission more time variable.\nPreibisch et al. (2005) discuss several possible explanations for\nthe suppression of activity. They favor the idea that accretion\nmodifies the magnetic field geometry and results in the \"massloading\" of field lines, thus hampering the heating of plasma\nto X-ray temperatures. It is at the same time conceivable that\nthe resulting magnetic field structure will be more unstable because of the the temporal variability of the mass accretion rate\nas well as the rotational shear at the inner edge of the circumstellar disk. In order tackle the so-far elusive activity-accretion\nrelation, a better characterization of the circumstellar/accretion\nproperties, e.g. measures of mass accretion rates, is essential.\nParticularly useful in these respect would be contemporary observations in the X-ray band and in accretion/outflow sensitive\noptical/NIR lines.\nAcknowledgements.
