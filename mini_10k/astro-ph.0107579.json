A model interpreting variations of EUV brightness upward propagating in\nsolar coronal loops as slow magnetoacoustic waves is developed. A loop is considered to\nhave a non-zero plane inclination angle and offset of circular loop centre from the baseline. The model also incorporates effects of dissipation and gravitational stratification. A\nlinear evolutionary equation is derived and applied to investigation of slow wave dynamics. Both the non-zero plane inclination and the offset decrease the growth of the wave\namplitude due to stratification. It is shown that wide spectrum slow magnetoacoustic\nwaves, consistent with currently available observations in the low frequency part of the\nspectrum, can provide the rate of heat deposition sufficient to heat the loop. In this\nscenario, the heat would be deposited near the loop footpoints which agrees with the\ncurrent observational data.\n\nKey words: Magnetohydrodynamics(MHD)\u2013 waves \u2013 Sun: activity \u2013 Sun: corona \u2013 Sun:\noscillations \u2013 Sun UV radiation\n\n1. Introduction\nIdentification of possible mechanisms of heating of solar coronal plasma and acceleration of solar wind is among the unsolved problems of solar physics. In the last two\ndecades there has been intensive theoretical work undertaken to advocate the idea of\ncoronal plasma heating by magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves. In particular, it has\nbeen suggested that coronal loops could be heated by dissipation of high frequency slow\nmagnetoacoustic waves (Porter, Klimchuk & Sturrock 1994a,b; Laing & Edwin 1995).\nHowever, up until recent observational advances, these studies have been poorly motivated because of the absence of observational evidence of the MHD wave activity in the\nsolar corona.\nSend offprint requests to: D. Tsiklauri (tsikd@astro.warwick.ac.uk)\n\n\f2\n\nD. Tsiklauri & V.M. Nakariakov: Wide-spectrum slow waves in loops\n\nRecent observations performed with SOHO/EIT and TRACE imaging telescopes have\nestablished:\n1. Existence of upward propagating perturbations of EUV brightness in long coronal\nloops at the bandpasses EIT 195\u00c5 (Berghmans & Clette 1999) and TRACE 171\u00c5 (Berghmans et al. 1999, De Moortel, Ireland & Walsh 2000), and EIT 195\u00c5 and TRACE 171\u00c5\nsimultaneously (Robbrecht et al. 2001). Probably, the same phenomenon was observed\nby Nightingale, Aschwanden & Hurlburt (1999) in TRACE 171\u00c5 .\n2. The projected velocities of these plasma density perturbations are about 65-165\nkm/s, which is below the sound speed corresponding to the temperature of the loop.\n3. The amplitude is usually 1-3% of the background density, reaching 5-6% in some\nobservations.\n4. The propagating disturbances are quasi-periodic with the periods of 3-20 min.\nThere is no a well-defined correlation between the periods and physical parameters of\nthe loops detected.\n5. The disturbances are detected in the loop legs near footpoints and always propagate\nupwards. There are no observations of waves propagating downwards.\nTwo rival interpretations of the propagating disturbances have been suggested. In the\nfirst (Reale, Peres & Serio 2000), the disturbances are considered as field-aligned flows\nof matter, generated by the siphon effect. In the second (Nakariakov et al. 2000), the\npropagating disturbances are associated with slow magnetoacoustic waves. The wavebased theory is similar to the model developed for the interpretation of compressive\nperturbations observed in polar plumes (Ofman, Nakariakov & Deforest 1999, Ofman,\nNakariakov & Sehgal 2000) in terms of slow magnetoacoustic waves. Both theories are\nconsistent with the observations and with the MHD theory, but the flow-based model has\ndifficulties with explanation of the periodicity and the symmetry of the front and back\nedges of the disturbance. Also, the observations do not show a change (acceleration) in\nthe propagating disturbance speed, predicted by the flow-based theory. In contrast, the\nwave-based theory explains all the observational findings and, in particular, justifies the\nabsence of downward propagating disturbances.\nIn the wave-based theory (Nakariakov at al. 2000), it has been established that the\nmain physical factors, which are important in the slow magnetoacoustic wave dynamics in\nlong coronal loops, include: (i) gravitational stratification, which is responsible for wave\namplitude amplification; (ii) dissipation, which leads to the conversion of wave kinetic\nenergy into heat in the large wave numbers part of the spectrum, and (iii) nonlinearity,\nwhich generally yields wave front steepening by generation of higher harmonics, leading\nto enhanced dissipation. An evolutionary equation for the slow magnetoacoustic wave\namplitude has been derived, which includes these three effects. However, in order to catch\n\n\fD. Tsiklauri & V.M. Nakariakov: Wide-spectrum slow waves in loops\n\n3\n\nthe physical essence of the problem without further complications, simple geometry of\nthe loop, namely, zero inclination angle and zero offset of the centre from the solar surface\nhas been assumed.\nIn contrast, observations show that the plane of a loop is not necessary perpendicular to the Sun's surface (a non-zero inclination) and the centre of the loop circle is\nusually situated below the surface (a non-zero offset) (e.g. Aschwanden et al. 1999). Consequently, a more elaborate theory of the slow magnetoacoustic waves in coronal loops,\nwhich includes the effects of the non-zero inclination and the non-zero offset, is required.\nSoft X-ray and EUV coronal telescopes provide the possibility to determine the distribution of density, temperature and heat deposition along a loop. Priest et al. (2000), using\nYohkoh/SXT observations concluded that hot, soft X-ray loops were heated uniformly.\nAschwanden et al. (1999), Aschwanden, Nightingale & Alexander (2000) and Aschwanden, Schrijver & Alexander (2001) analyzing SOHO/EIT and TRACE EUV observations\nargued that cooler loops were heated non-uniformly, near the loop footpoints. The specific mechanism for the energy deposition remains unknown and could, in principle, be\nassociated with dissipation of slow magnetoacoustic waves.\nDe Moortel et al. (2000) have estimated the energy of slow waves observed to be\ninsufficient to heat a loop. This result was based upon the assumption of the wave to be\na single harmonic with the period of several minutes. But, currently available resolution\nof the telescopes does not allow us to detect periodic motions with the periods shorter\nthan a few minutes, even if they are presented in the spectrum. On the other hand, the\nabsence of well-defined period in the loop waves suggests that their spectrum is probably\ncontinuous and not a single harmonic. We would like to point out that the main difficulty\nwith the theory of coronal loop heating by dissipation of slow magnetoacoustic waves has\nbeen connected with the absence of the observational evidence of these waves in the\ncorona. It has been believed that the waves somehow generated below the temperature\nminimum, are not able to penetrate through this layer. Now, the observational evidence\nof the long period longitudinal waves has been provided. The long period waves can have\nunresolved shorter period components in their spectrum. According to the theory, these\nshort period spectral components dissipate very quickly, and deposit the energy in the\nnear footpoint part of the loop legs.\nIn this paper we develop further the model of Nakariakov et al. (2000) for onedimensional slow magnetoacoustic waves in stratified coronal loops, taking into account\nthe effects of the non-zero loop plane inclination angle and the semi-circular loop offset, and derive a generalized evolutionary equation for slow magnetoacoustic waves in\ncoronal loops. It is shown that a coronal loop acts as a dissipative filter on the slow magnetoacoustic waves and that the short wavelength part of the wave spectrum dissipates\n\n\f4\n\nD. Tsiklauri & V.M.

A coronal loop is considered as a straight\nmagnetic field line with density and gravitational acceleration varying along the axis of\nthe cylinder.\n\nin the nearest vicinity of the loop footpoints. By calculating the heat deposition rate,\nprovided by the dissipation of the slow waves and comparing it with the observationally\ndetermined heat deposition rate in EUV loops, we show that sufficiently wide spectrum\nslow waves can deposit the required amount of energy in the lower parts of the loops,\nwhich is consistent with observations.\nThis paper is organized as follows: we formulated our generalized model in Section 2;\nSection 3 deals with the comparison of our model's predictions with the observations;\nand, finally, in Section 4 we close with a discussion of our main results.\n\n2. The model\nWe consider a semi-circular loop of the curvature radius RL . The loop cross-section is\ntaken to be constant. Validity of the latter assumption has been corroborated by Klimchuk et al. (1992) and by Aschwanden et al. (1999) for soft X-ray and EUV loops,\nrespectively. The loop is filled with a gravitationally stratified magnetized plasma of constant temperature. Here, we generalize Nakariakov et al.'s (2000) work by incorporating\neffects of loop plane inclination and offset of circular loop centre from the baseline. This\nis necessary since actually observed loops have the non-zero (measured from the normal\nto the solar surface) inclination angle \u03b1 and non-zero offset of circular loop centre from\nbaseline, Z0 , i.e. distance from the circle's centre to the solar surface.

Here, we used the fact that short\nwavelength slow magnetoacoustic waves are practically dispersionless and described by\nthe dispersion relation \u03c9 \u2248 Cs k. Consequently, their spatial and temporal spectra are\nsimilar.\nThe parametric studies of solution (6) are shown in Figures 2 and 3. Fig. 2 demonstrates the behaviour of a harmonic wave in identical loops with different values of the\ninclination angle \u03b1. Naturally, the increase of the inclination angle decreases the value of\nthe maximum amplitude the wave can reach. Indeed, larger inclination angle means less\nstratification of the plasma density in the loop, therefore lower maximal values. Fig. 3\nshows the evolution of the wave amplitude along the loop for different offsets of a circular loop centre from the baseline, Z0 . The increase in the loop centre offset leads to the\ndecrease of the loop length and also decreases the angle between the loop leg and the\nsurface of the Sun at the footpoint. The length of the loop is L = 2RL arccos(Z0 /RL ).\nObviously, the increase in Z0 reduces the effective stratification of the loop density and\nthis results in lower maximal amplitudes reached by the waves.\n\n\fD. Tsiklauri & V.M. Nakariakov: Wide-spectrum slow waves in loops\n\n9\n\n3. Evolution of the spectrum\nEq. (6) describes evolution of the spectral component k. In the exponent, the first term\nis positive in the ascending stage of the wave propagation, becomes zero when the wave\nreaches the loop apex and then becomes negative. The second term is always negative.\nConsequently, in the ascending stage, the wave evolution is described by the competition\nof these two terms describing effects of stratification and dissipation, respectively. Importantly, these two mechanisms operate in different spectral domains. Mathematically,\nEq. (6) is similar to an evolutionary equation of a dissipative filter in the theory of radio\ncircuits. Therefore, a coronal loop acts on slow magnetoacoustic waves as a dissipative\nfilter. If we knew the initial spectrum of the wave, the equation would allow us to determine the spectrum at each given height s of the loop. Unfortunately, the initial spectrum,\nespecially its short wavelength part, cannot be determined with the current resolution of\nEUV telescopes.\nEvolution of the spectrum is accompanied by the dissipation of spectral components.\nDifferent spectral components have different effective scale heights of the dissipation.\nAssuming the initial wave spectrum and following the spectrum evolution along the\nloop, we can determine the energy deposition rate at each given height s. Indeed, this\nfunction can be tested against the observations.\nIn order to compare predictions of our model with the observational data, we have\ninvestigated the behaviour of different slow magnetoacoustic wave spectral components in\nthe average EUV loop determined by Aschwanden et al. (1999), with RL = 93 Mm, Z0 =\n\u25e6\n\n62 Mm, \u03b1 = 7 , corresponding to the loop length of about L = 156 Mm. The evolution\nof different spectral components is shown in Figure 4. The dissipative coefficient \u03b7\u0304 has\nthe same value as was estimated in (Nakariakov et al. 2000). The spectral components\ncorresponding to shorter wavelengths (i.e. shorter period) dissipate faster and closer to\nthe loop footpoint.\nThe initial spectrum of the slow waves, V (0, k) \u2261\n\np\nf (k) is unknown, but it should\n\nsatisfy certain criteria. According to observations, the spectrum should have a maximum\nin the vicinity of 180\u2013420 s. The velocity amplitude of the maximum is about 1\u20133%\nof the speed of sound. Perhaps, there are also maxima in the shorter period part of\nthe spectrum, but they have not been resolved observationally. So, we assume that the\nspectrum gradually declines with the wave period. In order to avoid singularities in the\nintegration of the dissipated wave energy over the whole spectrum k = [0, +\u221e), we\nassume that f (k) \u2192 0 when k \u2192 +\u221e and k \u2192 0. Thus, we choose the spectrum f (k)\nwith a single maximum at k\u2217 .

Discussion\nRecently observed variations of EUV emission intensity, propagating upward along the\nlegs of solar coronal loops, are satisfactory interpreted in terms of the slow magnetoacoustic waves. We generalized the model of the slow wave evolution in a loop, suggested\nby Nakariakov et al. 2000 by taking into account effects of loop plane inclination and\noffset of the semi-circular loop centre from the solar surface. An evolutionary equation\nwhich governs the wave propagation in presence of gravitational stratification and dissipation was derived. Both non-zero inclination and offset affect the slow wave evolution,\nreducing the stratification of the loop plasma and, consequently, the amplitude growth\nof the upward propagating waves.\nIt was found that coronal loops act as dissipative filters of slow magnetoacoustic\nwaves. Different spectral components have different dissipation lengths and the wave\nspectrum evolves with height or with the distance along the loop. Therefore, the amount\nof wave energy deposited in the loop decreases with the height and the wave dissipation\ndeposits the energy in the lower parts of the loops. Making certain assumptions about the\nspectrum of the waves near the loop footpoints, we constructed a function describing the\nwave energy flux dissipated into heat in a loop segment. This function was compared with\nan observationally determined function approximating the nonuniform heat deposition\nrequirements. We conclude, that the observed heat deposition into coronal loops can be\ninterpreted as dissipation of slow magnetoacoustic waves, provided the wave spectrum is\nsufficiently wide. This conclusion is consistent with previously obtained results by Porter\net al. (1994a,b), but is based upon recently obtained observational information on the\nactual existence and parameters of slow magnetoacoustic waves in coronal loops and on\nthe nonuniform distribution of heat deposition in EUV loops. In the scenario proposed,\nthe short wave length components of the slow wave spectrum, with short dissipation\nlengths, are filtered out in the loop legs, depositing the energy and heating the loops near\nthe footpoints, while the long wave length spectral components, with longer dissipation\nlengths, propagate further and are detected by EUV telescopes.\nStrictly speaking, realistic spectrum of slow magnetoacoustic waves is restricted by\nthe acoustic cutoff wave number from below and by the inverse mean free path length\nfrom above. However, this does not seem to affect the results obtained, as the impact of\nthe long wavelength (lower frequency) part of the spectrum to heating is weak and as\n\n\f14\n\nD. Tsiklauri & V.M. Nakariakov: Wide-spectrum slow waves in loops\n\nthe short wavelength slow waves are efficiently dissipated in the collisionless regime too,\ndepositing the energy near the loop footpoints.\nTherefore, the theoretical results on the slow wave dissipation are consistent with the\nphenomenological results on EUV coronal loop heating and with the observed amplitude\nof the waves in the long wavelength part of the spectrum. The wide spectrum slow\nmagnetoacoustic waves can, indeed, deposit sufficient amount of energy near the loop\nfootpints, which is in agreement with the observations of Aschwanden et al. (1999, 2000,\n2001). We would like to emphasize that this possibility is purely theoretical due to not\nyet fully observed spectrum of the slow magnetoacoustic waves. However, our results\nindicate that the slow waves cannot be excluded from the consideration as a possible\nmechanism for heating of the coronal loops.\nAcknowledgements.
