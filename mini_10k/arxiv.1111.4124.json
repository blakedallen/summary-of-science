For symmetric nuclear matter with equal fractions of neutrons and protons, its EOS is relatively well-determined from analyses\nof the giant monopole resonances of finite nuclei [8, 9] as\nwell as collective flows [2] and subthreshold kaon production [10, 11] in relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions. On\nthe other hand, the EOS of asymmetric nuclear matter,\nespecially the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy Esym (\u03c1), is poorly known. During the last\ndecade, significant progress has been made both experimentally and theoretically on constraining the behavior\nof the symmetry energy around and below normal nuclear matter density [12\u201315] (See, e.g., Refs. [16\u201320] for\nreview of recent progress) while its super-normal density\nbehavior remains elusive and largely controversial [21\u2013\n24]. Theoretically, all many-body theory calculations to\ndate have demonstrated that the nuclear symmetry energy essentially characterizes the isospin dependent part\nof the EOS of asymmetric nuclear matter and the higherorder terms in isospin asymmetry are unimportant, at\nleast for densities up to moderate values [7], leading to\n\n\u2217 Corresponding\n\nauthor (email: lwchen@sjtu.edu.cn)\n\nthe well-known empirical parabolic law.\nWhen the empirical parabolic law itself provides a good\napproximation to the EOS of asymmetric nuclear matter and thus allows one to extract the symmetry energy\nfrom the energy difference between pure neutron matter\nand symmetric nuclear matter, it may cause large errors\nwhen it is applied to determine some physical quantities under special conditions. For example, the higherorder terms in isospin asymmetry presented in the EOS of\nasymmetric nuclear matter at supra-normal densities can\nsignificantly modify the proton fraction in \u03b2-equilibrium\nneutron-star matter and the critical density for the direct Urca process which can lead to faster cooling of neutron stars [25, 26]. In addition, recent studies [27] indicate that the higher-order terms in isospin asymmetry\nare very important for determining the transition density and pressure at the inner edge separating the liquid\ncore from the solid crust of neutron stars where the matter is extremely neutron-rich. Furthermore, the higherorder effects on the incompressibility of asymmetric nuclear matter have also been studied recently [28]. These\nstudies about the higher-order effects are essentially performed within the nonrelativistic models since the analytical expressions of the higher-order terms in isospin\nasymmetry, e.g., the nuclear matter fourth-order symmetry energy Esym,4 (\u03c1), can be relatively easily obtained\nin such nonrelativistic models. It is thus interesting to\nsee if the same conclusion can be obtained within the\nrelativistic models.\nOne of very popular relativistic models is the relativistic mean field (RMF) model which is generally\nbased on effective interaction Lagrangians involving nucleon and meson fields [29]. As a phenomenological ap-\n\n\f2\nproach, the RMF model has achieved great success during the last decades in describing many nuclear phenomena [30, 31]. Although the full expressions have been\nusually used in realistic RMF model calculations, nevertheless, it will be instructive to see separately the effects\nof the higher-order terms in isospin asymmetry, e.g., the\nnuclear matter fourth-order symmetry energy Esym,4 (\u03c1),\nwithin the RMF model. The main motivation of the\npresent work is to derive the nuclear matter fourth-order\nsymmetry energy Esym,4 (\u03c1) within the nonlinear RMF\nmodel and then explore the higher-order Esym,4 (\u03c1) corrections to the widely used empirical parabolic law for\nthe isospin asymmetric nuclear matter. Based on two\naccurately calibrated interactions, our results indicate\nthat the Esym,4 (\u03c1) may have significant influence on the\nproperties of isospin asymmetric nuclear matter, the proton fraction xp in \u03b2-stable neutron star matter and the\ncore-crust transition density \u03c1t and pressure Pt in neutron stars, confirming the previous nonrelativistic calculations.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section II,\nwe briefly discuss the bulk characteristic parameters of\nasymmetric nuclear matter. The model used in the\npresent paper and the analytical expression of the 4thorder symmetry energy will also given in this section.\nThe results and discussions are then presented in Section\nIII. Finally, a summary is given in Section IV.\n\nII.\nA.\n\n\u03b4 are usually very small. For example, the magnitude of\nthe \u03b4 4 term at normal nuclear matter density \u03c10 is estimated to be less than 1 MeV in microscopic many-body\napproaches [32\u201334] and also in phenomenological nonrelativistic models [28] as well as relativistic models as will\nbe shown in this work.

To our best knowledge, the formulas\n(30)-(35) give, for the first time, the analytical expression of the 4th-order symmetry energy Esym,4 (\u03c1) in the\nRMF model, which are the main results of the present\nwork. These analytical expressions allow us to evaluate accurately the 4th-order symmetry energy Esym,4 (\u03c1)\nand thus study the higher-order corrections to the empirical parabolic approximation within the framework of\nthe RMF model. Before presenting numerical results, it\nis instructive to analyze firstly the low density behavior\nof the Esym,4 (\u03c1). When \u03c1 \u2192 0, the magnitude of all\nfields will approach to zero and both EF\u2217 and M0\u2217 will\n\n\f5\nM\napproach to M , leading to Esym,4\n(\u03c1) \u2192 0 from Eq.

The FSUGold has been accurately calibrated to the ground-state properties of closed-shell nuclei, their linear response, and the structure of neutron\nstars while the IU-FSU is a recently developed effective\ninteraction that improves the FSUGold by incorporating\nsome of the recent constraints on properties of neutron\nstars. One can see from Fig. 1 that the Esym,4 (\u03c1) is quite\nsmall (less than 0.7 MeV) at normal nuclear matter density while it increases with density and can reach to about\n7 MeV at \u03c1 = 1 fm\u22123 . Furthermore, one can see that\nkin\nthe kinetic part Esym,4\n(\u03c1) dominates over the interacting\nM\npart Esym,4 (\u03c1) with the latter is generally negative.\nIn order to investigate higher-order Esym,4 (\u03c1) effects on\nthe EOS of asymmetric nuclear matter, it may make more\n\nsense to calculate the ratio of the 4th-order symmetry energy to the symmetry energy, i.e., Esym,4 (\u03c1)/Esym (\u03c1). In\nFig. 2, we show this ratio as a function of density with\ninteractions FSUGold and IU-FSU. It is seen that the\nratio Esym,4 (\u03c1)/Esym (\u03c1) has a very small value of about\n2% around normal nuclear matter density \u03c10 , but it can\nreach to about 6% \u223c 7% at high densities (e.g., 1.0 fm\u22123\nor 6 \u223c 7\u03c10 ). This result is essentially consistent with\nthe nonrelativistic calculations in some phenomenological models [41]. These features imply that the Esym,4 (\u03c1)\nmay become important at higher densities in some extreme physical conditions such as in neutron star where\nthe isospin asymmetry \u03b4 can be close to unity. As an\nexample, in the next subsection, we shall study effects\nof the 4th-order symmetry energy on the proton fraction\nin \u03b2-stable neutron star matter. In addition, one can\nsee from Fig. 2 that in the low density limit, we have\nlim Esym,4 (\u03c1)/Esym (\u03c1) = 1/27 as expected from the free\n\u03c1\u21920\n\nFermi gas model.\nThe analytical expression of the 4th-order symmetry\nenergy Esym,4 (\u03c1) allows us to calculate accurately the\ndensity slope and curvature parameters of Esym,4 (\u03c1),\ni.e., Lsym,4 and Ksym,4 , and thus obtain the accurate value of the higher-order isobaric incompressibility Ksat,4 of asymmetric nuclear matter according to\nEq.

((35))) are determined by the properties of\nsymmetric nuclear matter in FSUGold.\nFrom Table I, one can see that the Esym,4 (\u03c10 ) is generally less than 1 MeV (about 0.66 MeV for most of the\ninteractions considered here), consistent with that observed in Fig. 1. These results about the Esym,4 (\u03c10 ) are\nfurther in agreement with the calculations in the nonrelativistic models of MDI and Skyrme-Hartree-Fock [28],\nnicely verifying the empirical parabolic law around the\nnormal nuclear matter density \u03c10 .\nAs pointed out previously, the difference between\nKsat,2 and Kasy reflects the contribution from higherorder effects, namely, the value of J0 L/K0 , which has\nbeen usually neglected in many calculations in the literature [4, 9, 12, 14, 36].

It\nshould be noted that the higher-order Ksat,4 term can\nbe safely neglected in the study of giant resonance of\nfinite nuclei [42] where the isospin asymmetry \u03b4 is usually\nsmall, i.e., about 0.2.\nB.\n\nEffects of Esym,4 on the proton fraction in\n\u03b2-stable nuclear matter\n\nIn order to further illustrate the effects of the 4thorder symmetry energy on the EOS of asymmetric nuclear matter, we calculate the proton fraction xp in \u03b2stable neutron star matter where the isospin asymmetry\n\u03b4 is generally close to 1. The chemical composition of the\nneutron star is determined by the requirement of charge\nneutrality and equilibrium with respect to the weak interaction (\u03b2-stable matter). From the binding energy per\nnucleon, i.e., Eq. (1), we can calculate the proton fraction, xp = (1 \u2212 \u03b4)/2, for \u03b2-stable nuclear matter as found\nin interior of neutron stars. For neutrino free \u03b2-stable nuclear matter, the chemical equilibrium for the reactions\n\n\f7\nn \u2192 p + e\u2212 + \u03bd\u0304e and p + e\u2212 \u2192 n + \u03bde requires\n\u2202E\n\u2202\u03b4\n= 4\u03b4Esym (\u03c1) + 8\u03b4 3 Esym,4 (\u03c1) + O(\u03b4 5 )\n\n\u03bce = \u03bcn \u2212 \u03bcp = 2\n\n(37)\n\nwhere \u03bci = \u2202Ei /\u2202xi (i = n, p, e, \u03bc) is the chemical potential.

For\nthe FSUGold (IU-FSU) interaction and \u03c1 = 1.0 fm\u22123 ,\nfor instance, including the 4th-order symmetry energy in\nthe parabolic approximation to the EOS of asymmetric\nnuclear matter will increase the proton fraction xp from\n15.37% (13.44%) to 16.43% (14.81%), producing a relative variation of about 7% (10%). These results indicate\nthat the 4th-order symmetry energy may have obvious\neffects on the proton fraction xp in \u03b2-stable npe\u03bc matter\nand the parabolic approximation to the EOS of asymmetric nuclear matter may significantly underestimate\nthe proton fraction, especially at higher densities. These\nfeatures are consistent with the nonrelativistic SkyrmeHartree-Fock calculations [25].\nFurthermore, one can see from Fig. 3 that the difference between the results with the full EOS and with\nthe one containing the terms up to the 4th-order symmetry energy is very small, indicating that the EOS of\nasymmetric nuclear matter including the terms up to the\n4th-order symmetry energy (up to \u03b4 4 in Eq.

One\nsimple and widely used way to determine the core-crust\ntransition density \u03c1t is the so-called thermodynamical\nmethod, which requires the system to obey the following\nintrinsic stability condition [46\u201348]\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2202P\n> 0,\n(40)\n\u2212\n\u2202v \u03bcnp\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202\u03bcnp\n\u2212\n> 0,\n(41)\n\u2202qc v\nwhere the P = Pb + Pe is the total pressure of the npe\nmatter system with Pb and Pe denoting the contributions\nfrom baryons and electrons respectively, and the v and\nqc are the volume and charge per baryon number.

The\npressure Pe is only a function of the chemical potential difference \u03bcnp by assuming the \u03b2-equilibrium condition is satisfied, i.e., \u03bcnp = \u03bce . By using the relation\n\u2202Eb (\u03c1, xp )/\u2202xp = \u2212\u03bcnp with Eb (\u03c1, xp ) being energy per\nbaryon from the baryons in the \u03b2-equilibrium neutron\nstar matter and xp = \u03c1p /\u03c1, and treating the electrons\nas free Fermi gas, one can show [27] that the thermodynamical relations Eq.

However, recent studies based on some nonrelativistic models have\ndemonstrated [27] that the parabolic approximation to\nthe EOS of asymmetric nuclear matter may lead systematically to significantly higher core-crust transition\ndensities and pressures, especially with stiffer symmetry\nenergy functionals.

Furthermore, one can see that the 4th-order\nsymmetry energy may have even more drastic effects on\nthe core-crust transition pressure Pt , namely, including\nthe 4th-order symmetry energy in the parabolic approximation to the EOS of asymmetric nuclear matter reduces\ndrastically the core-crust transition pressure Pt .

It should be mentioned that the analytical expression of Esym,4 (\u03c1) can be easily generalized to the case\nof the density dependent RMF model that has similar\nisospin structure as the nonlinear RMF model (See, e.g.,\nRef. [52]). This provides the possibility to investigate the\nhigher-order Esym,4 (\u03c1) corrections to the widely used empirical parabolic law for the asymmetric nuclear matter\nin the RMF model. In the present work, as examples,\nwe have investigated the Esym,4 (\u03c1) effects on the properties of asymmetric nuclear matter, the proton fraction\nxp in \u03b2-stable npe\u03bc matter and the core-crust transition\ndensity \u03c1t and pressure Pt in neutron stars within the\nnonlinear RMF model with two accurately calibrated interactions, i.e., FSUGold and IU-FSU.\nFirstly, our results have indicated that the value of\nEsym,4 (\u03c1) at normal nuclear matter density \u03c10 is generally less than 1 MeV, and thus the empirical parabolic\napproximation E(\u03c1, \u03b4) \u2243 E0 (\u03c1) + Esym (\u03c1)\u03b4 2 has been\nnicely confirmed around \u03c10 . However, at higher densities such as 1 fm\u22123 , the value of Esym,4 (\u03c1) can be about\n7 MeV and the ratio of Esym,4 (\u03c1)/Esym (\u03c1) can reach to\nabout 7%. These results imply that the Esym,4 (\u03c1) may\nbecome nonnegligible at higher densities. Furthermore,\nthe analytical form of the Esym,4 (\u03c1) allows us to study\nthe higher-order effects on the isobaric incompressibility\nof asymmetric nuclear matter. Our results have indicated that the value of higher-order Ksat,4 is generally\nsmall compared with that of Ksat,2 , confirming the previous nonrelativistic calculations [28].\nSecondly, for the proton fraction xp in \u03b2-stable npe\u03bc\nmatter, we have found that, compared with the results\nfrom the empirical parabolic approximation to the EOS\nof asymmetric nuclear matter, including the 4th-order\nsymmetry energy Esym,4 (\u03c1) can enhance the proton fraction xp by about 10% at higher densities.

Therefore, our results have clearly demonstrated that the extensively used\nempirical parabolic approximation to the EOS of asymmetric nuclear matter may lead systematically to significantly higher core-crust transition density \u03c1t and pressure Pt in neutron stars within the nonlinear relativistic\nmean field model, confirming the previous finding based\non nonrelativistic calculations [27].\nTherefore, we conclude that the higher-order Esym,4 (\u03c1)\nin the EOS of asymmetric nuclear matter may have different effects on different quantities, and generally one\ncannot simply neglect them, especially under some extreme physical conditions, such as in neutron stars.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis work was supported in part by the National\nNatural Science Foundation of China under Grant\nNos. 10975097 and 11135011, the Shanghai RisingStar Program under grant No. 11QH1401100, \"Shu\nGuang\" project supported by Shanghai Municipal Education Commission and Shanghai Education Development Foundation, the Program for Professor of Special\nAppointment (Eastern Scholar) at Shanghai Institutions\nof Higher Learning, and the National Basic Research\nProgram of China (973 Program) under Contract No.\n2007CB815004.\n\n[3] J.M.
