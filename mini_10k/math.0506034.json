In this paper, we study\nquaternion involutions that have the additional properties of distribution over addition and multiplication. We review formal axioms for such involutions, and we show that the quaternions have an\ninfinite number of involutions. We show that the conjugate of a quaternion may be expressed using\nthree mutually perpendicular involutions. We also show that any set of three mutually perpendicular\nquaternion involutions is closed under composition. Finally, we show that projection of a vector or\nquaternion can be expressed concisely using involutions.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nInvolutions are usually defined simply as self-inverse mappings. A trivial example is conjugation of a\ncomplex number, which is obviously self-inverse. In this paper we consider involutions of the quaternions,\nthat is functions of a quaternion variable that are self-inverse. Quaternion conjugation is an obvious\ninvolution, but it is not the only quaternion involution. In fact, the quaternions have an infinite number\nof involutions, as we show. The paper begins by reviewing the classical basics of quaternions, and then\npresents axioms for involutions which go beyond the simple definition of a self-inverse mapping. Section 4\nthen presents the quaternion involutions, and section 5 presents their properties. Section 6 discusses the\nquaternion conjugate and shows that it may be expressed using three mutually perpendicular quaternion\ninvolutions. Finally, section 7 shows that the projection of a vector or quaternion may be expressed\nusing involutions.\n\n2\n\nBasics of quaternions\n\nA quaternion may be represented in Cartesian form q = w + ix + jy + kz where i, j and k are mutually\nperpendicular unit vectors obeying the multiplication rules below discovered by Hamilton in 1843 [1],\nand w, x, y, z, are real.\ni2 = j 2 = k2 = ijk = \u22121\n\n(1)\n\nThe conjugate of a quaternion is given by q = w \u2212 ix \u2212 jy \u2212 kz.\nThe quaternion algebra\np H is a normed division algebra. The modulus of a quaternion is the square\nroot of its norm: |q| = w2 + x2 + y 2 + z 2 , and every non-zero quaternion has a multiplicative inverse\n\u2217 Dr\n\nT. A. Ell is a Visiting Fellow at the University of Essex, funded by grant number GR/S58621 from the United\nKingdom Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council.\n\n1\n\n\fgiven by its conjugate divided by its norm: q \u22121 = q/|q|2 = (w \u2212 ix \u2212 jy \u2212 kz)/(w2 + x2 + y 2 + z 2 ). For\na more detailed exposition of the basics of quaternions, we refer the reader to Coxeter's 1946 paper [2].\nAn alternative and much more powerful representation for a quaternion is as a combination of a\nscalar and a vector part, analogous to a complex number, and this representation will be employed in\nthe rest of the paper: q = a + \u03bcb, where \u03bc is a unit vector, and a and b are real. b is the modulus of the\nvector part of the quaternion and \u03bc is its direction. In terms of the Cartesian representation:\np\nix + jy + kz\na = w,\nb = x2 + y 2 + z 2 ,\n(2)\n\u03bc=\nb\nLemma 1. The square of any unit vector is \u22121.\nProof. Let \u03bc be an arbitrary unit vector as defined in equation 2. Its square is given by:\n(ix + jy + kz)2\nx2 + y 2 + z 2\n2 2\ni x + j 2 y 2 + k2 z 2 + ijxy + jixy + ikxz + kixz + jkyz + kjyz\n=\nx2 + y 2 + z 2\n\n\u03bc2 =\n\nApplying the rules in equation 1 we get: \u03bc2 =\n\n\u2212x2 \u2212y 2 \u2212z 2\nx2 +y 2 +z 2\n\n= \u22121\n\nA corollary of Lemma 1 is that there are an infinite number of solutions to the equation x2 = \u22121.\nThe conjugate of a quaternion in complex form is q = a \u2212 \u03bcb. Geometrically, this is obviously a\nreversal of the direction of the vector part. The quaternion conjugate has properties analogous to those\nof the complex conjugate, with one minor exception: the quaternion conjugate is an anti-involution\nwhereas the complex conjugate is an involution. We define these terms in the next section, and we\nreturn to this point with Theorem 6 in section 6. The product of a quaternion with its conjugate gives\nthe norm, or square of the modulus. This follows directly from Lemma 1: (a + \u03bcb)(a \u2212 \u03bcb) = a2 \u2212 \u03bc2 b2 =\na2 + b2 = w2 + x2 + y 2 + z 2 .\n\n3\n\nInvolutions\n\nThe formal definition of an involution is not easy to find (most mathematical reference works define it\nsimply as a mapping which is its own inverse) but [3] gives a reasonably authoritative statement from\nwhich we reproduce the following axioms. It is clear from what follows in the paper that all three of\nthese axioms are important, otherwise it is possible to define trivial self-inverse mappings, which have\nuninteresting properties. We denote an arbitrary involution by the mapping x \u2192 f (x).\nAxiom 1. f (f (x)) = x. An involution is its own inverse.\nAxiom 2. An involution is linear: f (x1 + x2 ) = f (x1 ) + f (x2 ) and \u03bbf (x) = f (\u03bbx) where \u03bb is a real\nconstant.\nAxiom 3. f (x1 x2 ) = f (x1 )f (x2 ). If the terms on the right must be reversed (which can only be necessary\nif x1 and x2 do not commute), then f ( ) is an anti-involution.\n\n4\n\nQuaternion involutions\n\nInvolutions over the quaternion field have been published by Chernov [4], and used by B\u00fclow [5, 6], but\nwith an important difference from the involutions given in this paper: we show here that there are an\ninfinite number of involutions over the quaternion field whereas Chernov and B\u00fclow wrote of only three\n(plus conjugation). Chernov defined the following involutions, which we generalize in Theorem 1:\n\u03b1(q) = \u2212iqi = w + ix \u2212 jy \u2212 kz\n\u03b2(q) = \u2212jqj = w \u2212 ix + jy \u2212 kz\n\u03b3(q) = \u2212kqk = w \u2212 ix \u2212 jy + kz\n\n(3)\n\nThey also showed that the quaternion conjugate can be expressed in terms of these three involutions, a\nresult that we generalize in Theorem 7.\n2\n\n\fTheorem 1. The mapping q \u2192 \u2212\u03bdq\u03bd where q is an arbitrary quaternion is an involution for any unit\nvector \u03bd.\nProof. Axiom 1 is easily shown to be satisfied using Lemma 1: \u2212\u03bd(\u2212\u03bdq\u03bd)\u03bd = (\u22121)q(\u22121) = q. Axiom 2\nis seen to be satisfied from: \u2212\u03bd(q1 + q2 )\u03bd = \u2212\u03bdq1 \u03bd \u2212 \u03bdq2 \u03bd (multiplication of quaternions is distributive\nover addition). Since reals commute with quaternions, the second part of the axiom is trivially seen.\nAxiom 3 can be shown to be satisfied as follows:\nf (q1 )f (q2 ) = (\u2212\u03bdq1 \u03bd)(\u2212\u03bdq2 \u03bd)\n= \u03bdq1 \u03bd\u03bdq2 \u03bd\n= \u03bdq1 (\u22121)q2 \u03bd\n= \u2212\u03bdq1 q2 \u03bd = f (q1 q2 )\n\nNote that a mapping q \u2192 \u03bd 1 q\u03bd 2 (\u03bd 1 6= \u03bd 2 ) is its own inverse, but is not an involution as considered\nin this paper, because it does not satisfy axiom 3.\nIn what follows we introduce a new notation for involutions using an overbar with a subscript unit\nvector, thus q \u03bd = \u2212\u03bdq\u03bd. We refer to the direction defined by \u03bd as the axis of involution. The fact that\nwe use an overbar to denote involutions as well as the conjugate is not coincidental and we shall see that\nthere is a close relationship between involutions and conjugation.\n\n5\n\nProperties of quaternion involutions\n\nLemma 2. The product of any two vectors with arbitrary non-zero norms is a quaternion. The scalar\npart is minus the inner or scalar product of the two vectors and the vector part is the vector product of\nthe two vectors. Reversing the order of the product conjugates the resulting quaternion.\nProof. Let \u03bc1 = ix1 + jy1 + kz1 and \u03bc2 = ix2 + jy2 + kz2 . Their product is given by:\n\u03bc1 \u03bc2 = (ix1 + jy1 + kz1 )(ix2 + jy2 + kz2 )\n= i2 x1 x2 + j 2 y1 y2 + k2 z1 z2\n+ ijx1 y2 + jiy1 x2 + ikx1 z2 + kiz1 x2 + jky1 z2 + kjz1 y2\n= \u2212(x1 x2 + y1 y2 + z1 z2 )\n+ i(y1 z2 \u2212 z1 y2 ) + j(z1 x2 \u2212 x1 z2 ) + k(x1 y2 \u2212 y1 x2 )\nChanging the order of the product changes the order of all the products of two unit vectors i, j and k.\nSince ij = \u2212ji and so on, this negates all the components of the vector part of the result. The scalar\npart, \u2212(x1 x2 + y1 y2 + z1 z2 ), is unchanged. Thus reversing the order of the product conjugates the result,\nas stated. The scalar and vector parts can be seen to be equal to minus the scalar product and the vector\nproduct respectively, according to standard definitions of these products.\nLemma 3. The product of two perpendicular vectors changes sign if the order of the product is reversed.\nProof. Lemma 2 identified the scalar part of the result \u2212(x1 x2 + y1 y2 + z1 z2 ) as minus the inner product\nof the two vectors. Since the inner product is zero in the case of perpendicular vectors, the product of\nperpendicular vectors is a vector and it is the vector product of the two vectors. It follows that this\nvector changes sign (reverses) if the order of the product is reversed.\nTheorem 2. Composition: the composition of two perpendicular involutions is commutative. That is:\n\u03bd2\n\u03bd1\nq \u03bd1 = q \u03bd2\nwhere \u03bd 1 \u22a5 \u03bd 2 .\nProof.\nq \u03bd1\n\n\u03bd2\n\n= \u2212\u03bd 2 (\u2212\u03bd 1 q\u03bd 1 )\u03bd 2 = \u03bd 2 \u03bd 1 q\u03bd 1 \u03bd 2\n\nand by Lemma 3 we can reverse the order of the pairs of unit vectors if we change their signs:\nq \u03bd1\n\n\u03bd2\n\n= (\u2212\u03bd 1 \u03bd 2 )q(\u2212\u03bd 2 \u03bd 1 ) = \u2212\u03bd 1 (\u2212\u03bd 2 q\u03bd 2 )\u03bd 1 = q \u03bd 2\n\n3\n\n\u03bd1\n\n\fTheorem 3. Double Composition: given a set of three mutually perpendicular unit vectors, \u03bd 1 , \u03bd 2 , \u03bd 3 ,\nsuch that \u03bd 1 \u03bd 2 = \u03bd 3 , then\n\u03bd2\nq \u03bd1 = q \u03bd3\nProof.\nq \u03bd1\n\n\u03bd2\n\n= \u2212\u03bd 2 (\u2212\u03bd 1 q\u03bd 1 )\u03bd 2 = \u03bd 2 \u03bd 1 q\u03bd 1 \u03bd 2\n= \u2212\u03bd 1 \u03bd 2 q\u03bd 1 \u03bd 2 by Lemma 3\n= \u2212\u03bd 3 q\u03bd 3 = q \u03bd 3\n\nCorollary 1. Triple Composition: the composition of three mutually perpendicular involutions is an\nidentity.\nProof. From Theorem 3: q \u03bd 1\nq\n\n\u03bd2\n\n= q \u03bd 3 . Apply an involution about \u03bd 3 to both sides: q \u03bd 1\n\n\u03bd2 \u03bd3\n\n= q \u03bd3\n\n\u03bd3\n\n=\n\nThus we see that a set of three mutually perpendicular involutions (that is involutions about a set of\nthree mutually perpendicular axes) is closed under composition of the involutions and by Theorem 2 the\norder of the composition is unimportant.\nWe now present a geometric interpretation of quaternion involution.\nTheorem 4. Given an arbitrary quaternion q = a + \u03bcb, an involution q \u03bd leaves the scalar part of q\n(that is, a) invariant, and reflects the vector part of q (that is, \u03bcb) across the line defined by the axis of\ninvolution \u03bd. (Equivalently, the vector part of q is rotated by \u03c0 radians about the axis of involution \u03bd.)\nProof.\nq \u03bd = \u2212\u03bd(a + \u03bcb)\u03bd = \u2212\u03bda\u03bd \u2212 \u03bd\u03bcb\u03bd = \u2212\u03bd 2 a \u2212 \u03bd\u03bc\u03bdb\nand, since \u03bd is a unit vector, by Lemma 1:\nq \u03bd = a \u2212 \u03bd\u03bc\u03bdb\nWe recognise \u03bd\u03bc\u03bd to be a reflection of \u03bc in the plane p normal to \u03bd as shown by Coxeter [2, Theorem\n3.1]. Therefore \u2212\u03bd\u03bc\u03bd is a reflection of \u03bc in the line defined by \u03bd as shown in Figure 1. The result of\nthe reflection of the vector part remains a vector, and therefore the scalar part remains unchanged, as\nshown, and as stated.\nCorollary 2. An involution applied to a quaternion with vector part parallel to the involution axis is an\n\u03bd\nidentity, i.e., a + \u03bcb = a + \u03bcb, where \u03bd k \u03bc.\nProof. From Theorem 4: q \u03bd = a \u2212 \u03bd\u03bc\u03bdb. Since both \u03bd and \u03bc are unit vectors, and are parallel, \u03bd = \u00b1\u03bc\nand the result on the right reduces to a + \u03bcb = q in both cases.\nCorollary 3. An involution applied to a quaternion with vector part perpendicular to the involution axis\n\u03bd\nconjugates the quaternion, i.e., a + \u03bcb = a \u2212 \u03bcb, where \u03bd \u22a5 \u03bc.\nProof. From Theorem 4: q \u03bd = a \u2212 \u03bd\u03bc\u03bdb. If \u03bd \u22a5 \u03bc we can use Lemma 3 to reverse the order of the two\nunit vectors, thus obtaining a + \u03bd 2 \u03bcb = a \u2212 \u03bcb = q as stated.\nLemma 4. The product of two unit vectors is a quaternion with argument equal to the angle between\nthe two vectors.\nThe sign of the argument is significant, because it depends on the ordering of the two vectors (the\nangle is measured from the first vector to the second).\n\n4\n\n\fFigure 1: Reflection of a vector \u03bc in a line defined by a unit vector \u03bd. p is a plane perpendicular to \u03bd\nseen edge on.\nProof. Lemma 2 identified the scalar and vector parts of the product of two vectors with minus the inner\nproduct, and the vector product respectively of the two vectors. Since these products are given for unit\nvectors by cos \u03b8 and \u03bc sin \u03b8, where \u03bc is perpendicular to the plane containing the two vectors, we may\nwrite the product of two unit vectors as: \u2212 cos \u03b8 + \u03bc sin \u03b8 = \u2212 exp(\u2212\u03bc\u03b8).\nTheorem 5. The composition of two involutions is a rotation of the vector part of the quaternion\noperated upon about an axis normal to the plane containing the two axes of involution. The angle of\nrotation is twice the angle between the two involution axes. In the case where the two involutions are\nperpendicular the composite result is of course an involution, which is a rotation of the vector part of the\nquaternion by \u03c0.\nProof. Let \u03bd 1 and \u03bd 2 be two unit vectors and q be an arbitrary quaternion. Then the composition of\ntwo involutions about \u03bd 1 and \u03bd 2 is given by:\nq \u03bd1\n\n\u03bd2\n\n= \u2212\u03bd 2 (\u2212\u03bd 1 q\u03bd 1 )\u03bd 2 = \u03bd 2 \u03bd 1 q\u03bd 1 \u03bd 2\n\nFrom Lemma 2 we can write the result on the right as pqp, where p = \u03bd 2 \u03bd 1 is a unit quaternion1 .\nSeparating q = a + \u03bcb into its scalar and vector parts we obtain:\nq \u03bd1\n\n\u03bd2\n\n= ppa + p\u03bcbp = a + (p\u03bcp)b\n\nWe recognise the term p\u03bcp as a rotation as given by Coxeter [2, Theorem 3.2]. The axis of rotation\nis given by the vector part of p, and the angle of rotation is twice the argument of p. Therefore, from\nLemma 2 we know that the axis of rotation is perpendicular to the plane containing the two vectors,\nand from Lemma 4 we know that the angle of rotation is twice the angle between the two vectors.\n\n6\n\nThe quaternion conjugate\n\nTheorem 6. The quaternion conjugate is an anti-involution.\nProof. The definition of the conjugate of a quaternion q = a + \u03bcb is q = a \u2212 \u03bcb. We have to show that\nthis satisfies the three axioms given in section 3, and that in Axiom 3 we have to reverse the terms on\nthe right-hand side.\nIt is easily seen that the quaternion conjugate satisfies Axiom 1. To demonstrate that the quaternion\nconjugate satisfies Axiom 2, let q1 = a + \u03bc1 b and q2 = c + \u03bc2 d. Then q1 + q2 = (a + c) + (\u03bc1 b + \u03bc2 d).\nSince reversing two vectors also reverses their sum, we see that the quaternion conjugate is distributive\nover addition, as required. The second part of the axiom is easily seen.\n1p\n\nis a unit quaternion, because it is the product of two unit vectors. This follows from the fact that the quaternion\nalgebra is a normed algebra.\n\n5\n\n\fTo show that the quaternion conjugate satisfies Axiom 3, we state the required equality and then\ndemonstrate that it is satisfied by expanding the left and right hand sides until identical:\nq1 q2 = q2 q1\n(a + \u03bc1 b)(c + \u03bc2 d) = (c \u2212 \u03bc2 d)(a \u2212 \u03bc1 b)\nExpanding the left hand side, we employ Axiom 2:\nac \u2212 \u03bc1 \u03bc2 bd \u2212 \u03bc1 bc \u2212 \u03bc2 ad = ac + \u03bc2 \u03bc1 bd \u2212 \u03bc1 bc \u2212 \u03bc2 ad\nand using Lemma 3 we change the order of the two vectors in the second term on the right-hand side to\nobtain the required result:\nac \u2212 \u03bc1 \u03bc2 bd \u2212 \u03bc1 bc \u2212 \u03bc2 ad = ac \u2212 \u03bc1 \u03bc2 bd \u2212 \u03bc1 bc \u2212 \u03bc2 ad\n\nWe now show that the quaternion conjugate can be expressed using the sum of three mutually\nperpendicular involutions.\nLemma 5. The sum of three mutually perpendicular involutions applied to a vector negates the vector\n(reverses its direction). That is, given a set of three mutually perpendicular unit vectors as in Theorem\n3 and an arbitary vector \u03bc:\n\u03bc \u03bd 1 + \u03bc \u03bd 2 + \u03bc \u03bd 3 = \u2212\u03bc\n(4)\nProof. Let \u03bc = \u03b7 1 + \u03b7 2 + \u03b7 3 where \u03b7 i k \u03bd i , i \u2208 {1, 2, 3}. In other words, resolve \u03bc into three vectors2\nparallel to the three mutually perpendicular unit vectors \u03bd 1 , \u03bd 2 and \u03bd 3 . Substitute this representation\nof \u03bc into the left-hand side of Equation 4:\n\u03b7 1 + \u03b7 2 + \u03b73\n\n\u03bd1\n\n+ \u03b71 + \u03b72 + \u03b73\n\n\u03bd2\n\n+ \u03b71 + \u03b7 2 + \u03b7 3\n\n\u03bd3\n\n= \u2212\u03bc\n\nAxiom 2 allows us to apply the involutions separately to the three components:\n\u03b7 1 \u03bd 1 + \u03b7 2 \u03bd 1 + \u03b7 3 \u03bd 1 + \u03b7 1 \u03bd 2 + \u03b7 2 \u03bd 2 + \u03b7 3 \u03bd 2 + \u03b7 1 \u03bd 3 + \u03b7 2 \u03bd 3 + \u03b7 3 \u03bd 3 = \u2212\u03bc\nWe now make use of Corollaries 2 and 3. In this case we are applying them to a vector, so the first states\nthat an involution with axis parallel to a vector is an identity, and the second states that an involution\nwith axis perpendicular to the vector reverses, or negates, the vector:\n\u03b7 1 \u2212 \u03b7 2 \u2212 \u03b7 3 \u2212 \u03b7 1 + \u03b7 2 \u2212 \u03b7 3 \u2212 \u03b7 1 \u2212 \u03b7 2 + \u03b7 3 = \u2212\u03bc\nand cancelling out, we obtain: \u2212\u03b7 1 \u2212 \u03b7 2 \u2212 \u03b73 = \u2212\u03bc, which is the assumption we made at the start of\nthe proof.\nThe following theorem is a generalization of a similar result given in [5, Definition 2.2, p.12].\nTheorem 7. Given a set of three mutually perpendicular unit vectors as in Theorem 3, the conjugate of\nq may be expressed as:\n1\n(5)\nq = (q \u03bd 1 + q \u03bd 2 + q \u03bd 3 \u2212 q)\n2\nProof. Let q = a + \u03bcb. Substituting this expression for q into the right-hand side of Equation 5 we\nobtain:\n\u0011\n1\u0010\n\u03bd1\n\u03bd2\n\u03bd3\nq=\na + \u03bcb + a + \u03bcb + a + \u03bcb \u2212 (a + \u03bcb)\n2\nWe now apply the three involutions separately to the components of q using Axiom 2, and noting from\nTheorem 4 that the scalar part a is invariant under involutions:\nq=\n2 The\n\n1\n(a + \u03bc \u03bd 1 b + a + \u03bc \u03bd 2 b + a + \u03bc \u03bd 3 b \u2212 a \u2212 \u03bcb)\n2\n\nthree vectors \u03b7i are not, in general, of unit modulus.\n\n6\n\n\fGathering terms together and factoring out b:\nq =a+\n\n1\n(\u03bc \u03bd 1 + \u03bc \u03bd 2 + \u03bc \u03bd 3 \u2212 \u03bc) b\n2\n\nand the right-hand side is equal to a \u2212 \u03bcb by Lemma 5.\n\n7\n\nProjection using involutions\n\nFinally, we now demonstrate the utility of quaternion involutions by presenting formulae for projection\nof a vector into or perpendicular to a given direction. These results have been published in [7], but\nwithout explicit use of involutions.\nTheorem 8. An arbitrary vector \u03bc may be resolved into two components parallel to, and perpendicular\nto, a direction in 3-space defined by a unit vector \u03bd:\n\u03bck\u03bd =\n\n1\n(\u03bc + \u03bc \u03bd )\n2\n\n\u03bc\u22a5\u03bd =\n\n1\n(\u03bc \u2212 \u03bc \u03bd )\n2\n\nwhere \u03bck\u03bd is parallel to \u03bd and \u03bc\u22a5\u03bd is perpendicular to \u03bd, and \u03bc = \u03bck\u03bd + \u03bc\u22a5\u03bd .\nProof. From Theorem 4, \u03bc \u03bd is the reflection of \u03bc in the line defined by \u03bd as shown in Figure 1. When \u03bc\nis added to its reflection the components of each perpendicular to \u03bd cancel, and the components parallel\nto \u03bd add to give twice the stated result. The factor of 12 gives the result as stated. Similarly, half the\ndifference between \u03bc and its reflection gives the component of \u03bc perpendicular to \u03bd.\nTheorem 8 may be generalised to quaternions as well as vectors. Since the scalar part of a quaternion\nis invariant under an involution, the component of the quaternion 'parallel' to \u03bd includes the scalar\npart as well as the component of the vector part parallel to \u03bd. In other words the 'parallel' component\nof the quaternion is that component which is in the same Argand plane as the axis of involution \u03bd.\nThe component of the quaternion perpendicular to \u03bd is a vector (the component of the vector part\nperpendicular to \u03bd, and therefore perpendicular to the Argand plane of the 'parallel' component) since\nthe subtraction cancels out the scalar part. As stated earlier, the representation a + \u03bcb is independent\nof the coordinate system in that it expresses the quaternion in terms of the direction in 3-space of the\nvector part. However, the quaternion can be rewritten in terms of a set of orthogonal basis vectors,\n\u03bd 1 , \u03bd 2 , and \u03bd 3 , without recourse to a numerical representation. The three projections across \u03bd 1 , \u03bd 2 ,\nand \u03bd 3 and the conjugate anti-involution provide the mechanism. That is, we may write a quaternion\nq = a + \u03bcb = a + b as\nq = a + \u03bd 1 \u03b1 + \u03bd 2 \u03b2 + \u03bd 3 \u03b3 = a + b1 + b2 + b3\nwhere bi k \u03bd i and \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 are real:\na=\n\n1\n(q + q);\n2\n\nb=\n\n1\n(q \u2212 q);\n2\n\nbi =\n\n1\n\u03bdi\n(b + b ),\n2\n\ni \u2208 {1, 2, 3}\n\nReferences\n[1] W.
