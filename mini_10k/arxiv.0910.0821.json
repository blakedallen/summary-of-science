Requiring that MLT use a hydrodynamically realistic dissipation\nlength gives a new constraint on solar models. While the stellar structure which results\nis similar to that obtained by YREC (Guenther, Demarque, Kim & Pinsonneault 1992;\nBahcall & Pinsonneault 2004) and Garching models (Schlattl, Weiss & Ludwig 1997),\nthe theoretical picture differs. A new quantitative connection is made between macroturbulence, micro-turbulence, and the convective velocity scale at the photosphere,\nwhich has finite values. The \"geometric parameter\" in MLT is found to correspond\nmore reasonably with the size of the strong downward plumes which drive convection\n(Stein & Nordlund 1998), and thus has a physical interpretation even in MLT. Use of\n3D simulations of both adiabatic convection and stellar atmospheres will allow the determination of the dissipation length and the geometric parameter (i.e., the entropy\njump), with no astronomical calibration.\nA physically realistic treatment of convection in stellar evolution will require additional modifications beyond MLT, including effects of kinetic energy flux, entrainment\n(the most dramatic difference from MLT found by Meakin & Arnett (2007b) ), rotation,\nand magnetic fields (Balbus & Hawley 1998; Balbus 2008).\nSubject headings: stars: evolution - stars: hydrodynamics - convection - Sun: photosphere white dwarfs - atmospheres:3D - Binaries: eclipsing\n\nused in stellar evolution (B\u00f6hm-Vitense 1958;\nCox 1968; Clayton 1983; Hansen & Kawaler\nRecent simulations of three-dimensional\n1994; Kippenhahn & Weigert 1990) is flawed.\ncompressible convection and their theoretical\nThis mixing length l is parameterized as\nanalysis (Meakin & Arnett 2007b; Arnett, Meakin, & \u03b1Young= l/H , where H is the local presML\nP\nP\n2009) have shown that the interpretation of\nsure scale height, and \u03b1M L is adjusted to\nmixing-length theory (MLT), as currently\nreproduce the radius of the present-day Sun.\nHowever, instead of being an adjustable pa1\nSteward Observatory, University of Arizona, 933\nrameter, the mixing length is found to corN.

From our own simulations (Meakin & Arnett\n2009) and those of others we find a robust tendency for the dissipation length to be\nld \u2248 min(lCZ , 4HP ),\n\n(1)\n\nwhere lCZ is the depth of the convection zone.\nFor shallow convection zones, the dissipation\nlength is limited by the depth of the convective region, and seems to approach a limiting\nvalue of ld \u2248 4HP for deep convection zones.\nIf \u03b1M L is fixed, other parameters in MLT,\nwhich are generally left fixed by historical convention, may be adjusted to compensate (e.g., (Tassoul, Fontaine, & Winget\n1990; Salaris & Cassisi 2008)). The most significant of these parameters is the geometric\nfactor1 , which adjusts the rate at which radiation limits the degree of entropy excess in the\nsuper-adiabatic region (SAR). For simplicity\nwe use gM L to denote the geometric factor in\nunits of the value used in conventional MLT\n(see Appendix for details). If we identify the\ngeometric parameter as a measure of the size\nof the SAR, we remove the last free parameter in MLT. Although MLT is an incomplete\ntheory, it does serve as a useful \"language\"\nto explain some of the changes implied by 3D\nsimulations.\nThe mixing length theory itself (Vitense\n1953; B\u00f6hm-Vitense 1958), if used consistently, does capture many (but not all) aspects of turbulent convection. However, a real\nreplacement for MLT will provide a global solution and relax the local connection between\nthe superadiabatic gradient and the enthalpy\nflux, so that regions of the convective zone can\nbe subadiabatic, as observed in simulations.\nIn order to establish a \"baseline\" from\nwhich to compare new effects demanded by\n1\n\nThis\nis\nessentially\nthe\nc\nTassoul, Fontaine, & Winget (1990).\n\nfactor\n\nnumerical simulations and by laboratory experiment (e.g., fluctuations, non-locality, and\nentrainment), the framework of the standard\nsolar model (Bahcall, Serenelli, & Pinsonneault\n2004) is examined with respect to modification of some aspects of convection. In this\npaper we show that the addition of dynamically realistic values of mixing length and geometric factor give some interesting insights\ninto the nature of the average stratification\nof the Sun just below the photosphere. In\nSection 2 we construct a series of solar models with \u03b1M L -gM L pairs, to delineate their\nproperties. The notion of a \"standard solar model\" derives from the work of John\nBahcall and collaborators, and is summarized in Bahcall (1989). It represents what\nis probably the most carefully tested aspect\nof the theory of stellar evolution. In Section 3\nwe compare our models to standard results\nusing the Yale Rotational Evolution Code\n(Guenther, Demarque, Kim & Pinsonneault\n1992; Bahcall & Pinsonneault 2004), and the\nGarching code (see Schlattl (1996); Schlattl, Weiss & Ludwig\n(1997)). In Section 4 we compare the outer\nlayers of our models to the 3D atmospheres\nof Nordlund and Stein (Asplund, et al. 2005),\nsemi-empirical models of the solar atmosphere\n(Fontenla et al. 2006), and re-examine the\nquestion of convective velocities at the photosphere. In Section 5 we summarize the implications of this work.\n2.\n2.1.\n\nSolar Models\nHydrodynamically-consistent MLT\nParameters\n\nTassoul, Fontaine, & Winget (1990) have\ndefined the parameters in MLT in a concise\nway: they define three parameters a, b, and\nc in terms of an adjustable mixing length l.\nIn the notation of Arnett, Meakin, & Young\n(2009), \u2206\u2207 = \u2207 \u2212 \u2207e , so we have\n\nof\n\na = vc2 HP /l2 g\u03b2T \u2206\u2207,\n2\n\n(2)\n\n\fTable 1\nMixing Length Parametersa\nMLT choice\nBV58b\nML2c\nAMYd\n\na\n\nb\n\n0.125\n1\n\u2248 0.1\n\n0.5\n2\n0.256\n\nc\n\nl\n24\n16\n\n24/gML e\n\nfree parameter\nfree parameter\nmin(4HP , lCZ )\n\na\n\nAs defined in Tassoul, Fontaine, & Winget (1990).\n\nb\n\nB\u00f6hm-Vitense (1958); this is ML1.\n\nc\n\nTassoul, Fontaine, & Winget (1990); Salaris & Cassisi (2008)\n\nd\n\nArnett, Meakin, & Young (2009), and this paper.\n\u221a\ne\ngML = (l/ 3rb )2 , where rb is the radius of a blob just contained\ninside the SAR.\n\nb = Fc HP /\u03c1vc CP T l\u2206\u2207,\n\n(3)\n\nc = CP \u03c12 lvc \u03ba(\u2207e \u2212 \u2207a )/\u03c3T 3 \u2206\u2207\n\n(4)\n\nthe values for adiabatic turbulent convection (Arnett, Meakin, & Young 2009), leaving\nc = 24/gM L as the remaining free parameter.\nNote that the flavors BV58 (ML1) and ML2\nboth differ from those suggested by the simulations.\nEven though there are additional effects\nshown in 3D turbulent simulations which are\nnot contained in MLT, it is useful to examine\nthose changes which can be captured with a\nstandard stellar evolution code. If the value\nof \u03b1M L = l/HP is fixed, which of these parameters is to be varied in MLT to get an\nacceptable solar model? The only parameter sufficient to the task is the \"geometric\nparameter\" (i.e., c or gM L ). A simple way\nto examine the effects of the geometric parameter is to vary its value relative to the\nvalue used in conventional MLT; we denote\nthis scaled value by gM L (see the Appendix\nbelow). We relate this\n\u221afactor to the size of the\nSAR by gM L = (ld / 3rb )2 , where the \"blob\ndiameter\" 2rb is the thickness of the SAR.\nMLT results if we set gM L = 1; this identifies\nthe SAR with the superadiabatic \"element\"\nof Kippenhahn & Weigert (1990), p. 50. In\n\nand\n\nTable 1 gives standard values for the mixing length parameters in the formulation of\nTassoul, Fontaine, & Winget (1990).\nThe\nfirst two entries are the standard \"flavor\"\ndue to B\u00f6hm-Vitense (1958), and the ML2\nflavor of Tassoul, Fontaine, & Winget (1990).\nIn both cases the values of a, b, and c are\nfixed and the mixing length l adjusted to\nreproduce the solar radius of the present\nday Sun. The third line presents the values of these parameters as estimated from\n3D simulations (Meakin & Arnett 2007b;\nArnett, Meakin, & Young 2009). Two striking differences are apparent: (1) the mixing length is not an arbitrary constant. For\ndeep convection zones (like the Sun which\nhas lCZ = 20HP ) the mixing length (dissipation length) approaches 4HP . (2) the\n\"c\" parameter is intimately related to the\ngeometric factor, and we assume to the\nthickness of the superadiabatic layer. Both\nthe \"a\" and \"b\" parameter are fixed at\n3\n\n\f(1990), with the modifications via the dimensionless geometric factor gM L as given\nin the Appendix; gM L \u2261 1 gives conventional MLT. We stress that convection is\ntreated in exactly the same way, with the\nsame parameters, in the interior and in the\nenvelope (VandenBerg, et al. 2008). Diffusion was treated with the Thoul subroutine (see Thoul, Bahcall, & Loeb (1994));\nradiative levitation (Michaud et al. 2004)\nwas ignored. The nuclear reactions were\nsolved in a 177 isotope network using Reaclib\n(Rauscher & Thielemann 2000); weak screening rates were incorporated as in John Bahcall's exportenergy.f program. The changes\nin metalicity due to nuclear reactions and to\ndiffusion were taken into account by interpolation in both the opacity and the equation of\nstate tables. The same equation of state and\nopacity tables are used in the interior and the\natmosphere.\n\nMLT, the \"blob\" is assumed to have a dimension fixed by the mixing length. This is\ninconsistent with 3D atmosphere simulations\n(Stein & Nordlund 1998)) and solar models\n(Guenther, Demarque, Kim & Pinsonneault\n(1992); Schlattl, Weiss & Ludwig (1997) and\nbelow), which show that the superadiabatic\nregion is narrow, less than a pressure scale\nheight thick. MLT has two characteristic\nlengths, one of which is ignored by forcing\nthe geometric parameter length scale to be\nthe same as the mixing length (turbulent dissipation length). We will allow the \"blob\"\nsize to differ from the mixing length in order\nto vary gM L .\nFor theoretical clarity we will apply radiative diffusion theory consistently up to\nthe photosphere. While radiation transfer\ntheory is more accurate than radiative diffusion, it is more cumbersome, and itself\nis affected by the convection model used\n(VandenBerg, et al. 2008). After we understand the convection problem better, this approach can be extended by a more sophisticated multi-dimensional treatment of radiative transfer in the outer regions. Comparison to 3D hydrodynamic atmospheres (e.g.,\nStein & Nordlund (1998); Nordlund & Stein\n(2000)) can test the validity of this approach.\n\n2.3.\n\nModified MLT Models\n\nWe examine the solar models resulting\nfrom several choices of the mixing length, each\nconstructed by varying the geometric factor\ngM L until the correct radius of the present day\nSun was obtained. The other MLT parameters a and b are the flavor ML1 in Table 1.\nFive such models were constructed, with\n2.2.

In\nMLT, the velocity obtained by a convective\neddy is computed from the work done by the\nbuoyancy force over a mixing length:\nvc2 = \u03b12M L gHP \u03b2T (\u2206\u2207)/8,\n\nwhich such saturation occurs at \u03b1M L \u2248 4.\nThis may be appropriate for the simulations\nof Nordlund and Stein (R. Stein, private communication) and those of Meakin & Arnett\n(2009), and is consistent with the insensitivity\nof the Stein & Nordlund (1998) simulations\nto the exact position of the lower boundary,\nwhich was deeper than this. Further analysis\nof this issue is in progress Meakin & Arnett\n(2009); 3D simulations for convective zones\nof depth 0.5 to 5 pressure scales heights seem\nconsistent with this interpretation. The distribution of values for \u03b1M L in Table 2 covers\nthis range.\nSofter equations of state, such as in partial ionization zones or electron-positron pair\nzones, give less vigorous velocities, but do not\nchange the qualitative picture (Arnett, Meakin, & Young\n2009). The simulations of Porter & Woodward\n(2000), for an ideal gas equation of state, also\nseem to suggest that saturation may be beginning around \u03b1M L \u2248 3, which is consistent.\nFigure 1 shows the evolutionary tracks in\nthe HR diagram, for each of the models (which\ndiffer only by the \u03b1M L and gM L parameters). For each \u03b1M L , a value of gM L is chosen which gives a reasonable radius for the\npresent-day Sun. After passing the stellar\nbirthline (deuterium burning, L \u2248 10 L\u2299 , see\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03b2T is the compressibility, HP the pressure scale height, and \u2206\u2207 \u2261 \u2207 \u2212 \u2207ad is\nthe usual \"super-adiabatic excess.\" For a\ngiven convective luminosity, larger \u03b1M L implies larger velocities.\nShallow convection zones, having shorter\ndistances for buoyant acceleration to work,\nwill have smaller values of \u03b1M L and smaller\nvelocity scales (Arnett, Meakin, & Young 2009).\nAs the depth of the convection zone increases,\nthe size of the largest eddies also rises, implying larger \u03b1M L . Such an increase will not continue indefinitely; more vigorous convection\ndevelops more violent dissipation. The value\nof \u03b1M L seems to \"saturate\" for very deep\nconvection zones (Arnett, Meakin, & Young\n2009; Meakin & Arnett 2009). The solar\nconvection zone is 20 pressure scale heights\ndeep, and has yet to be simulated for its\nfull depth with resolution as high as used in\nMeakin & Arnett (2007b) or Stein & Nordlund\n(1998). Here we will examine the case in\n5\n\n\fsolar model uses MLT and therefore ignores\nseveral significant aspects of convection: turbulent heating, flux of kinetic energy, and entrainment. These effects may move our models toward the inferred values from helioseismology. In any case the differential effects we\ndiscuss here are much larger, and unlikely to\nbe affected by small modifications in the reference model. Notice that the predicted values\nof rCZ and Hesurf vary in only the fourth significant figure for models A through E while\nthe velocity scale increases by more than 40\npercent.\n\nStahler & Palla (2004)), the tracks are very\nsimilar for all five models. However the increasing values of \u03b1M L imply increasing turbulent velocities (Eq. 5). Table 2 gives values\nof the radius (R/R\u2299 ), luminosity (L/L\u2299 ), the\nradius of the lower boundary of the convective zone (rCZ /R\u2299 ), the surface (convective\nzone) abundance of helium by mass fraction\n(Hesurf ), and the maximum mean turbulent\nvelocity in the convection zone (vm ) in km/s.\nThe increase in vm with \u03b1M L is clear.\nThe models were adjusted to radius and\nluminosity of the present-day Sun to about\none part in 103 or better, which is sufficient\nto show accurately the differential effects to\nbe discussed here.\nIt is well known that, once a calibration\nof MLT parameters is done to fit the solar radius, paths in the HR diagram are\nlittle affected by which parameters were\nused (Pedersen, Vandenberg, & Irwin 1990;\nSalaris & Cassisi 2008). However, the variation of the velocity scale, although noticed\nby Pedersen, Vandenberg, & Irwin (1990) for\nexample, has not been stressed. In Table 2 it\nis striking that only the velocity scale varies\nsignificantly with the variation of \u03b1M L and\ngM L pairs constrained to fit the radius and\nluminosity of the present day Sun. This velocity scale is crucial for rates of entrainment,\nwave generation, and mass loss, and so may\nultimately cause a change in the evolutionary behavior when such effects are correctly\nincluded. It will be argued below that this\nvariation in the velocity scale has direct observational consequences (via line profiles and\nmicro- and macro-turbulent velocities).\nThe values of the lower radius of the solar\nconvection zone rCZ and the surface helium\nabundance Hesurf are slightly different from\nthe values of the standard solar model. Part\nof the difference may be due to small errors in\nour stellar evolution code, which is not yet in\nits fully verified state. However the standard\n\n3.\n\nYREC and Garching Solar Models\n\nOur solar models are in good agreement\nwith YREC and Garching models, but not\nyet as close to either as they are to each\nother2 In this paper we concentrate on the\ndifferences caused by changing MLT parameters and outer boundary conditions, rather\nthan finding the absolute best standard solar model. Finding the absolute best solar\nmodel requires going beyond present formulations used in YREC and Garching codes (e.g.,\nMichaud et al. (2004); Meakin & Arnett (2007b);\nArnett, Meakin, & Young (2009)); we plan to\naddress this in detail in future publications.\n3.1.\n\nEmpirical Outer Boundaries\n\nThe Yale code (Demarque & Percy 1964;\nGuenther, Demarque, Kim & Pinsonneault 1992)\nuses as an outer boundary condition the empirically derived fit of Krishna Swamy (1966)\nto the T \u2212 \u03c4 relation for the Sun, \u01eb Eridani,\nand Gmb 1830. Empirical fits have the flaw\nthat they are suspect if extrapolated; these\n2\n\n6\n\nOur goal is to develop a software environment that\nallows modification of physical modules by logical\nswitches, thus maintaining consistency between old\nand new implementations. We plan to persist until\nwe have an option that removes even the small differences which remain for the standard solar model.\n\n\fTable 3\n\"Blob Sizes\" and Mixing Length\nModel\n\n\u03b1ML\n\ngML\n\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\n\n1.650\n2.323\n3.286\n4.000\n5.190\n\n1.0\n42.0\n270.0\n595.0\n1,540.0\n\nlb /HP\n\nlb /lm\n\n1.65\n0.358\n0.200\n0.164\n0.132\n\n1.0\n0.154\n0.0608\n0.0410\n0.0255\n\nstars are on the main sequence, and of G\nand K spectral type (G2V, K2V, and G8Vp,\nrespectively). Gmb 1830 is a halo star of\n0.64M\u2299 with a metalicity of about 0.1 of solar\n(Allende Prieto, et al. 2000), while \u01eb Eridani\nis a solar metalicity star of about 0.85M\u2299 . If\napplied to stars of the same stage of evolution and the same abundance, such empirical\nboundary condidtions are at their best. Unfortunately the \"calibration\" approach may\nhide mistakes in the assumed physics.\n3.2.\n\nAtmospheric Outer Boundaries\n\nThe Garching code (Schlattl 1996) was\nmodified (Schlattl, Weiss & Ludwig 1997) to\nuse synthetic atmospheres fitted to the interior solution at optical depth (\u03c4 = 20). In\naddition a spatially varying mixing length\nwas employed to reproduce the pressuretemperature stratification calculated by 2Dhydrodynamic models (Freytag, Ludwig, & Steffen\n1996). This involved the interpolation between an atmospheric value (Balmer-line\nfits gave \u03b1at = 0.5) and an interior value\n(\u03b1int = 1.7 to get the correct solar radius);\nsee (Freytag, Ludwig, & Steffen 1996) for details. This approach can be extended with a\nlibrary of hydrodynamic model atmospheres\n(and unlike the Yale approach, is not in principle limited to G stars). However, we find\nthat our own 2D simulations, because of the\npinning of vortices, do not mix material as\n\nFig. 1.- Solar models which differ only by\nthe mixing length and the geometric factor,\nscaled to have the same radius. The trajectories in the HR diagram nearly overlay one another except on the Hayashi track, where they\nare poorly constrained. Note that the stellar birthline (Stahler & Palla 2004) lies near\nlog L/L\u2299 \u2248 1; the more luminous parts of the\ntracks ignore accretion and so are not realistic.\n\n7\n\n\fefficiently as 3D. For a given driving, 2D\ngives higher velocities to maintain the same\nconvective luminosity (Asplund, et al. 2000;\nMeakin & Arnett 2007a,b). Further, 2D simulations have a different turbulent cascade\nand damping than 3D, which is related to\nthis velocity difference. These issues need to\nbe dealt with in making contact between actual convective velocities and observed line\nwidths.\n3.3.\n\nThe Subphotospheric Region\n\nFig. 2.- Structure of sub-photospheric regions with different choice of the \u03b1M L \u2212\ngM L pairs. Model A is the lowest curve,\nand models B, C, D and E are successively higher.\nModel A is similar\nto the \"Eddington-approximation\" case of\nSchlattl, Weiss & Ludwig (1997) while models C, D, and E are similar to their \"2D-hydromodel\" case.\n\nHow does changing the \u03b1M L -gM L pair\naffect the structure of the sub-photospheric\nlayers? Figure 2 shows models A through\nE in the log pressure - log temperature\nplane. This may be directly compared with\nFig. 1 in Schlattl, Weiss & Ludwig (1997).\nModel A is almost identical to their curve\nlabeled \"Eddington-approximation\", which\nused radiative diffusion and MLT with conventional parameters (essentially the same as\nmodel A, \u03b1M L \u2248 1.7 and gM L = 1). In\ncontrast, model D, which also used the Eddington approximation but used MLT with\n\u03b1M L = 4.0 and gM L = 595.0, closely resembles their curves labeled \"2D-hydro-model\"\nand \"1D-model-atmosphere\", and models C\nand E are similar. It appears that the significant point is not the choice of radiative diffusion versus radiative transfer, but rather the\ntreatment of convection (VandenBerg, et al.\n2008). The Yale group get hydrodynamics by\nempirical fitting to hydrodynamic observed\natmospheres, the Garching group get hydrodynamics by a fit to their 2D hydrodynamic\natmospheres, and we get hydrodynamics by\nanalytic theory based on 3D simulations of\nconvection.\n\nFig. 3.- Structure of the super-adiabatic region (SAR), with \u2206\u2207 = \u2207 \u2212 \u2207ad versus logarithm of pressure (dynes/cm2 ). The width\nof the SAR is much less than a pressure scale\nheight; this may be compared with lb /HP in\nTable 2. The small blob size implied in models C, D, and E are consistent with the small\nwidth of the SAR, which is all we should expect without a 3D atmospheric model. Notice\nthe small sub-adiabatic region just below the\nphotosphere (the left of the graph, indicated\nby the arrow).\n8\n\n\f4.\n4.1.\n\ning length parameter \u03b1M L imply larger velocity scale (larger vm ) as Table 2 shows. Thus,\nmodels A\u2013E are a sequence having increasingly vigorous and narrowly restricted regions\nof convective driving (acceleration).\nFigure 3 shows the structure of the SAR for\nmodels A through E. This may be compared\nto Fig. 2. of Schlattl, Weiss & Ludwig (1997).\nAgain model A resembles their \"Eddingtonapproximation\" curve, and models C, D and\nE are similar to their \"2D-hydro-model\" and\n\"1D-model-atmosphere\" curves. Here \u2206\u2207 \u2261\n\u2207\u2212\u2207a is plotted against logarithm of pressure\n(dynes/cm2 ).\nAbove the horizontal line \u2206\u2207 = 0, buoyant forces accelerate the turbulent flow, while\nbelow the line we have buoyancy damping\n(deceleration; this region is barely visible at\nthe left edge of the curve). According to\nMLT with the Schwarzschild criterion for convection, there should be no flow for \u2206\u2207 \u2264\n0. The area above (under) the curve gives\nthe net buoyant acceleration (deceleration).\nClearly the deceleration, seen as the small\ndepression near log P = 5, is overcome by\nthe much larger region of acceleration around\nlog P \u2248 5.2, so that the Schwarzschild criterion gives incorrect results here. The area argument implied in Figure 3 is essentially the\nbulk Richardson number criterion (Fernando\n1991; Meakin & Arnett 2007b), and is nonlocal. Therefore, because the pathological deceleration implied by use of the Schwarzschild\ncriterion is incorrect, the velocities vm given\nin Table 2 are directly related to those which\nproduce solar line broadening.\n\nThe SAR and Surface Velocities\nThe Geometric Factor gM L\n\nAlthough the traditional procedure for calibrating stellar convection is the variation of\nthe parameter \u03b1M L to adjust the stellar radius\nkeeping gM L constant, this is not the most\nnatural choice. It is gM L that determines\nthe radiative diffusion rate from \"convective\nblobs\", and is most effective in the super adiabatic region (SAR). In the adiabatic regions,\nMLT gives an adiabatic gradient, so the choice\nof \u03b1M L is irrelevant to structure there. Historically, the reasonable choice - of forcing\na one-parameter family by assuming constant\nvalues for all parameters except \u03b1M L - has\nobscurred the physics. Simulations uncovered\nthis mistake, with the indication that \u03b1M L is\ndetermined by the dissipation which is fed by\nthe turbulent cascade, exactly as Kolmogorov\n(1941, 1962) suggested.\nThe geometric factor gM L may be expressed in terms of a ratio of time to transit\na mixing length to time for diffusion to remove the super-adiabatic excess from a \"blob\"\n(Kippenhahn & Weigert 1990). It is not well\ndefined because of geometric vagueness about\nthe \"blob\"; here we take it to be proportional to the inverse square of the ratio lb /lm ,\nwhere lb is the blob diameter and lm the mixing length. This is a deviation from MLT,\nfor which lb \u2261 lm . With this identification\nwe can compare the blob sizes for different\n\u03b1M L \u2013gM L combinations given in Table 2.\nThis is shown in Table 3. Notice that\nfor larger values of mixing length parameter\n\u03b1M L , the blob size becomes smaller, whether\nmeasured relative to a pressure scale height\n\u221a\nlb /HP = 1/ gM L or relative to a mixing\n\u221a\nlength lb /lm = 1/(\u03b1M L gM L ). This means\nthat, for acceptable solar pairs of \u03b1M L \u2013gM L ,\nlarger values of the mixing length imply narrower and more intense superadiabatic regions\nto drive the convection. Larger values of mix-\n\n4.2.\n\nMicro- and Macro-turbulence\n\nFigure 4 shows the run of turbulent velocity\nas a function of optical depth for the five models, and for the Nordlund-Stein 3D hydrodynamic atmosphere quoted in Asplund, et al.\n(2005). The semi-empirical stellar atmosphere models of Fontenla et al. (2006) give\n9\n\n\fcurves similar to those of Nordlund-Stein, but\nare not plotted to reduce crowding. The most\nstriking feature in this figure is the difference between the low depth behavior of the\nmodels (an abrupt cliff at \u03c4 \u2248 1), and the\n3D-atmospheres (a gentler slope for lower \u03c4 ).\nThis is due to the use in the 1D models of the\nSchwarzschild criterion for convection, a local\ncondition. A weakly-stable stratification cannot really hold back vigorous motion, as use\nof the local Schwarzschild criterion implies.\nThe micro- and macro-turbulent velocities,\n\u03b6mi and \u03b6ma , are parameters which were introduced long ago 3 to account for the embarassment that, according to the Schwarzschild\ncriterion, conventional solar atmospheres are\nnot q\nconvective at the surface. Note that if\n2 + \u03b6 2 , then 1.9 \u2264 \u03b6 \u2264 3.0 km/s for\n\u03b6 = \u03b6mi\nma\nthe Sun (Cox 2000). This is indicated by the\nvertical bounded line in Figure 4. The connection between this \u03b6 and the actual turbulent velocity due to convection is not simple,\ninvolving line-formation, photon escape, and\ninhomogeneous stellar surface layers.\nFortunately, multi-dimensional hydrodynamic atmospheres (Asplund 2000; Nordlund & Stein\n2000) do provide a spectacular fit to line\nshapes, with no free parameters, so we identify the convective velocities well below the\nphotosphere (optical depth \u03c4 & 3) in these\nsimulations with those predicted by our\nhydro-dynamically consistent choice of mixing length parameter \u03b1M L . This means we\nare essentially matching different 3D simulations in the region of adiabatic convection,\nwhere they should give identical answers, and\nminimizing the sensitivity of the match to\nthe complexities of atmospheric detail. Optical depth is sensitive to temperature (the\nopacity is \u03ba \u221d T 9 here), so that the visible\nsurface is a complex structure (see Fig. 24\n\nFig. 4.- Convective velocities versus log optical depth for solar models which differ only\nby the mixing length and the geometric factor.\nThe convective velocity changes while there\nare no other significant changes; standard\nmixing length theory with the Schwarzschild\ncriterion was used. Case A had \u03b1M L = 1.643\nand the usual geometric factor, gM L = 1.\nCase D (\u03b1M L = 4 and gM L = 595.0) is the\nestimated value for saturation of the dissipation length for a solar convection zone of\ndepth of 20 pressure scale heights. In MLT\nthe velocity scale is not constrained physically,\nbut only fixed by historical parameters (which\nare inconsistent with both 3D simulations and\nhydrodynamic theory). The 3D model atmosphere data from Asplund, et al. (2005) are\ndramatically different at small optical depth.\n\n3\n\n10\n\nSee Huang & Struve (1960) for an early review, in\nwhich \u03b6 is already a well established parameter.\n\n\fin Stein & Nordlund (1998)). For example,\na 10% fluctuation in temperature implies a\nchange in 2.4 in the opacity. The optical\ndepth of the photosphere occurs at different\nradii for different positions on the solar surface, so that fitting it with a single radius\nis difficult. At greater depths we expect the\n3D atmospheres and the 1D models to agree,\nbut near the surface it is not clear that the\n3D and 1D definiinitions of optical depth are\nconsistent.\nPressure should be a better coordinate for\nmatching 3D results to a 1D model. Unlike\nthe optical depth, the pressure is a weaker\nfunction of angular position on the solar surface. Hydrodynamic flow tends to smooth\npressure variations, making the definition of a\nmean pressure-radius relation more meaningful. Figure 5 plots convective velocities versus log pressure for models A through E. We\ncan see that the Asplund, et al. (2005) model\nsmoothly joins onto model D.\nLet us construct a simple model of the\nmotion in this region to see how hydrodynamic arguments might give modifications to\nthe purely hydrostatic boundary conditions\nused in models A through E. We will assume\nthat the velocity is dominated by flow at the\nlargest scales of turbulence. These scales contain most of the kinetic energy, and are least\nnon-laminar. Convective motions are driven\nby the sinking of matter which is cooling due\nto transparency near the surface. This generates gravity waves in the near-surface region.\nWe will approximate the large scale average\nof this motion by g-modes (Landau & Lifshitz\n(1959), see \u00a7 12) whose amplitude falls off exponentially with pressure scale height. This\nimplied a scaling with position above an interface at radius r0 , P (r) = P (r0 )v(r)/v(r0 ).\nDespite its extreme simplicity and harsh assumptions, this simple picture gives a significantly improved approximation to the behavior of the velocity in the photospheric re-\n\nFig. 5.- Convective velocities versus log\npressure, for solar models and 3D hydrodynamic solar atmospheres. The atmospheres\nextend to lower pressure than the solar models (actually the atmospheres extend to higher\npressure too, but these values were not in Table 1 of Asplund, et al. (2005)). It is clear\nthat the 3D atmospheres would join smoothy\nonto solar model D for \u03b1M L = 4.0 and gM L =\n595.0, as we would have predicted. The thin\nsolid curve labeled \"Simple hydro\" represents\na hydrodynamic extrapolation from the point\nof maximum convective velocity (see text).\nReplacing the MLT estimate (based on the\nSchwarzschild criterion and hydrostatic structure) with a physically motivated extimate\ngives a strikingly better agreement with both\nthe 3D atmospheres and the empirical solar\ndata.\n\n11\n\n\fcally consistent velocity field (i.e., a consistent\nchoice of \u03b1M L and an adjusted gM L ), gives a\nbetter agreement with\n\ngions. The thin black line labeled \"Simple\nhydro\" in Figure 5 represents such flow, fitted from the point of maximum convective\nvelocity in model D. It captures the qualitative behavior far better than the conventional hydrostatic assumptions (shown as the\nsteep \"cliff\" near log P = 5.25), and promises\nto do better as the complex physics of the\nphotosphere is more faithfully represented\n(Stein & Nordlund 1998; Nordlund & Stein\n2000).\nThis suggests that the photospheric velocity may be estimated by \u03b6 \u2248 0.8 vm , which\npredicts a connection between fitted line\nshapes and convective flow. Better physics\nfor turbulent flow seems to be needed in\n1D stellar atmospheres, and some 3D features are difficult to represent in 1D, such\nas inhomogeneity between upward and downward moving flows (Stein & Nordlund 1998;\nNordlund & Stein 2000; Steffen, M. 2007).\nThe 3D hydrodynamic atmospheres can provide insight into the correct mapping of realistic physics of a multi-modal region onto a\n1D stellar model, and tighter constraints on \u03b6\nfor a given vm . For Models A through E, this\ncondition favors Model D.\nIndependent of any estimate of \u03b6, our simulations and theory (Meakin & Arnett 2007b;\nArnett, Meakin, & Young 2009) suggest from\nhydrodynamics alone that models C, D and E\nare most plausible, i.e., \u03b1M L lies in the range\nof 3 to 5 because of enhancement of turbulent damping in deeply stratified convection\nregions (\u03b1M L \"saturation\"). This consistency\nis encouraging.\n5.\n\n1. empirical T (\u03c4 ) relations, and\n2. 3D hydrodynamic models of stellar atmospheres.\nUsing the correct condition for mixing (the\nbulk Richardson number) implies that the\n1D atmospheres should exhibit hydrodynamic\nflow. Further, simple hydrodynamic considerations (Press 1981; Press & Rybicki 1981)\nsuggest g-mode waves will be generated and\npenetrate to the photosphere (these are generated by turbulent forcing from convection).\nWe show that there is a connection between\nthe predicted turbulent velocity scale and the\nobserved (macro and micro)-turbulent velocities, which removes the embarrassment of\nnon-convective surface regions predicted by\n1D stellar atmosphere theory. As a bonus,\nwe find that the observed macro- and microturbulence for the Sun can be used to fix the\nchoice of gM L (model D).\nWe may also have a resolution of an apparent contradiction. Atmospheric models of\nwhite dwarfs (Winget 2008; Bergeron et al.\n1995), which have shallow convection zones,\nuse MLT parameters (ML2: \u03b1 = 0.6, considerably smaller than used for the Sun),\nindicating less vigorous convection.\nLow\nmass eclipsing binaries (Stassun, et al. 2008;\nMorales, et al. 2008) are generally fit with\n\u03b1 \u223c 1 (again low convective efficiency), these\nmodels do not have shallow convection zones.\nIn MLT there is no rationale for these differences. Use of Eq. 1 will give models having\nthin convection zones which agree with MLT\nmodels using small \u03b1M L , so we expect to reproduce the white dwarf results. For low mass\nstars, the surface temperatures will be lower\nthan the solar value, so that the SAR should\ncomprise more mass, i.e., we expect larger\n\nSummary\n\nInsights from 3D compressible convection\nsimulations and theory (Meakin & Arnett\n2007b; Arnett, Meakin, & Young 2009) have\nbeen applied to sub-photospheric regions of\nsolar models. Even within MLT, a dynami-\n\n12\n\n\fregion (SAR). Alternatively, the constraint\nthat the observed micro- and macro-turbulent\nvelocities agree with those predicted using the\nbulk Richardson criterion for surface convective mixing can be used instead of the SAR\nsize.\nMLT is still an incomplete theory, but it\nis suggestive that even modest changes toward a better physical interpretation, based\nupon 3D simulations and on a more complete\nturbulence theory, do give improvements in\nthe models. MLT, as used here, may be derived from a more general turbulent kinetic\nenergy equation by ignoring certain terms\n(Arnett, Meakin, & Young 2009). Some of\nthe ignored terms are important, emphasizing that MLT is incomplete. However, the\napproach sketched above may be generalized,\nand inclusion of missing terms gives a convection theory that is nonlocal, time dependent, provides robust velocity estimates, and\nis based on simulations and terrestrial experiment, with no astronomical calibration. This\nmore difficult theory will be presented in detail in future publications.\n\ngM L to be physically correct. Table 2 indicates that there is a trade off between \u03b1M L\nand gM L : to compensate for lower gM L , \u03b1\nmust be lower, for the same radius. For a\ndeep convection zone, \u03b1M L is fixed; then a\nstronger SAR (larger gM L , and more inefficient convection) will give a larger radius.\nThis is the sense of the discrepancy of the\ncomputed radii for low mass eclipsing binaries\n(Stassun, et al. 2008; Morales, et al. 2008),\nand we suggest that part of the discrepancy\nmay be due to the convection algorithm used.\nUnfortunately, direct calculation of low mass\ndwarfs (M \u2248 0.2M\u2299 ) with \u03b1M L \u2248 4 exposes\nlimitations in MLT: the SAR is forced upward\ninto the photosphere, making 3D atmospheres\na necessity for gaining insight into a plausible\ntreatment in stellar models.\nWe have, in fact, sketched a way to eliminate astronomical calibration from stellar convection theory:\n1. Adjust \u03b1M L from convection simulations. The mixing length is lm =\n\u03b1M L HP (where HP is the pressure\nscale height), and equal to the depth of\nthe convection up to 4 HP , and \u03b1M L \u2248 4\nfor deeper convection zones.\n\nThis work was supported in part by NSF\nGrant 0708871 and NASA Grant NNX08AH19G\nat the University of Arizona. We wish to\nthank Robert Stein for discussion of his unpublished work on turbulent damping in solar\nconvection simulations, Robert Buchler for\ndiscussions on modeling time-dependent convection, and Martin Asplund for providing\nmachine-readable copies of solar surface models.\n\n2. Adjust gM L from 3D hydrodynamic atmosphere simulations, fitting the curve\nof super-adiabatic excess in the superadiabatic region. This is more accurate,\nbut equivalent to adjusting gM L to reproduce a self-consistent SAR.\nNotice that a fit to the present day solar radius is not logically necessary.\nBy seriously considering MLT, we have determined that no significant free parameters\nare left to adjust within the framework of the\ntheory. We find that the choice of two characteristic lengths, which are determined by the\nflow, close the system: the turbulent dissipation length and the size of the super-adiabatic\n13\n\n\fA.\n\nMLT Geometric Parameter\n\nThis analysis uses the formulation of Kippenhahn & Weigert (1990); see their discussion for more\ndetail. In the mixing-length theory, there are two important conditions which involve radiative\ndiffusion: luminosity conservation and blob cooling. The simple condition L = L(rad) + L(conv)\nis written as\n3\n8\n(A1)\n(\u2207 \u2212 \u2207e ) 2 = U (\u2207r \u2212 \u2207),\n9\nwhich is identical to Eq. 7.15 of Kippenhahn & Weigert (1990). Here the subscripts on the \u2207's\ndenote e for mass element (the blob), a for adiabatic, r for radiative, and no subscript for the\nbackground (environment) value. The diffusive cooling of the blob implies\n1\n\n\u2207e \u2212 \u2207a = gM L 2U (\u2207 \u2212 \u2207e ) 2 ,\n\n(A2)\n\nwhich is identical to Eq. 7.14 of Kippenhahn & Weigert (1990), except for the introduction of a\nscaling factor gM L . For gM L \u2261 1 we regain conventional MLT. Thus, the definition of U becomes\ngM L U =\n\ngM L h 3acT 3 8HP \u0011i\n(\n,\nl2 \u03ba\u03c12 CP g\u03b2T\n\n(A3)\n\nwhich is their Eq. 7.12 with an extra factor gM L , and our \u03b2T is their \u03b4. If we define U \u2217 = gM L U\nand \u03b6 2 = \u2207 \u2212 \u2207a + (U \u2217 )2 , we may write\n(\u03b6 \u2212 U \u2217 )3 +\n\n8\nU \u2217 (\u03b6 2 \u2212 (U \u2217 )2 \u2212 W ) = 0,\n9gM L\n\n(A4)\n\nwhich is Eq. 7.18 of Kippenhahn & Weigert (1990), except for the factor of gM L in the denominator\nand the replacement of U by U \u2217 . The same solution procedures may now be applied to solve for \u03b6\nand hence \u2207. Any value of gM L that is not excessively large or small (within a few powers of ten\nof unity) has no significant effect except in regions that are both convective and nonadiabatic.\nAn estimate of gM L in terms of the size\u221a\nof a convective \"element\" or \"blob\" is given in Table 1\n2\nabove,\nis the \"blob\" radius. In MLT, rb \u2261\n\u221a which we repeat here: gM L = (l/ 3rb ) , where rb \u221a\nl/ 3 \u2248 0.577l, forcing two independent length scales, l and 3rb , to be the same.\nAdjustment of gM L allows the super-adiabatic region to have the correct entropy jump, for any\nreasonable value of the mixing length parameter \u03b1M L ; that is, \u03b1M L may be chosen to be hydrodynamically consistent. This does not provide a consistent convective theory if other important\neffects, such as entrainment and wave generation, are ignored.\n\n14\n\n\fCox, J.
