INTRODUCTION\nAlthough polarization is a fundamental property of electromagnetic radiation, there have been no astronomical\nmeasurements of polarization in the X-ray band in over 30 yr. There has been no lack of workable concepts,\nincluding simple designs such as the Polarimeter for Low Energy X-ray Astrophysical Sources (PLEXAS) that was\nproposed by Marshall et al. (2003) to use multilayer-coated mirrors tuned to 0.25 keV as Bragg reflectors.1 An\nexcellent review of the history and prospects for astronomical polarimetry in the 0.1-10 keV band is presented by\nWeisskopf et al. (2006).2 Weisskopf et al. rightly argue that the PLEXAS design had a narrow bandpass, reducing\nits attractiveness for astrophysical observations because one expects polarization to be energy dependent, so a\nwide bandpass is desired.\nMarshall (2007;3 hereafter, Paper I) described a method to overcome this limitation by using transmission\ngratings to disperse in the incoming X-rays. Then, a multilayer-coated reflector would be used to modulate\nthe signal in a way depending on the polarization. Two approaches were suggested. The first was a simple\nmodification of a dispersive spectrometer, such as a grating spectrometer proposed for Constellation-X (Con-X).\nThe second approach was intended to provide a means for obtaining polarimetric data by inserting optics forward\nof the focal plane of a long focal length telescope such as XEUS.\nSimilar to one of the approaches suggested in Paper I, this paper is limited to the case where the polarization\nis determined by measuring spectral intensity along different dispersed spectra. In this case, we consider a\nconfiguration that would be appropriate for a small orbiting observatory.\n\n2. A SOFT X-RAY POLARIZING SPECTROMETER\n2.1 The Spectrometer\nAs in Paper I, the approach to this polarimeter design was inspired by a new blazed transmission grating design,\ncalled the Critical Angle Transmission (CAT) grating,4 and the corresponding application to the Con-X mission\nin the design of a transmission grating spectrometer.5 For details of the Con-X mission, see the Con-X web site\nat http://constellation.gsfc.nasa.gov/. This type of grating can provide very high efficiency in first order\nin the soft X-ray band. For a spectrometer, one places detectors on the Rowland torus, which is slightly ahead\nof the telescope's imaging surface.\nAs in the design for Con-X, using a sector of the primary allows one to take advantage of the asymmetric\nscattering profile of the mirror surfaces. As noted by Cash (1987, and references therein), the scattering profile\nis much broader in the plane that contains the optical axis (radially away from the mirror surface) than in the\nazimuthal direction. Thus, the images produced using a small sector of the mirror will be narrow in one dimension\nFurther author information: E-mail: hermanm@space.mit.edu, Telephone: 1 617 253 8573\n\n\fand broad in the other. By arranging the gratings so that the dispersion direction is along the direction of tight\nimaging, one obtains better spectral resolution than if the entire aperture was used. We exploit this feature to\nprovide modest spectral resolution in each of many sectors, even with mirrors with 0.5-1.50 half-power diameter\nimaging.\nThere are several factors involved in setting the telescope focal length: the grating period, P ; the mirror\nimaging size (in one dimension), \u03b4\u03b8; and the shortest wavelength of interest, \u03bbmin . For a given focal length, F ,\nmin\nand placing the gratings at, say, 0.9F from the polarizer, we find that the spectral resolution is given by 0.9\u03bb\nP \u03b4\u03b8 .\nFor this study, we target a spectral resolution of \u223c 200 at the shortest wavelengths of interest, near 1.5 nm (0.8\nkeV), so that we may obtain a spectral resolution that is > \u00d72 better than that provided by the multilayer\ncoatings. This criterion gives \u03b4\u03b8 = 14\u25e6 in one dimension. The mirror half-power diameter can be 4-10\u00d7 larger\nthan this value, due to the larger in-plane mirror scattering. Thus, mirrors with average imaging of order 1-20\nwould be acceptable for this project.\nThe system focal length is set only by the requirement that the detector pixels are at least \u00d74 smaller than\nthe spectral resolution element, F \u03b4\u03b8. For 25\u03bc pixel sizes, then F > 1.5 m, so the telescope can be very short.\nEffective area is a premium in polarimetry, due to the expected low polarization signals. For a graze angle of\n1\u25e6 , needed to reflect 0.8 keV X-rays off Al mirrors at > 90% efficiency, the mirror diameter could be 28 cm for\nF =2 m. Assuming an inner diameter of 10 cm and an average reflectivity to two reflections of about 70%, the\neffective area of the mirror would be about 200 cm2 .\n\n2.2 The Polarizer\nA CAT-based spectrometer becomes a polarimeter by placing multilayer-coated flats on the Rowland circle\ninstead redirecting and polarizing the spectra. The flats are tilted about the spectral dispersion axis by an angle\n\u03b8. For this study, the graze angle, \u03b8 is 40\u25e6 . The detectors are then oriented toward the mirrors at an angle\n90 \u2212 2 \u2217 \u03b8 = 10\u25e6 to the plane perpendicular to the optical axis of the telescope. Fig. 1 shows how the optics\nmight look. In this case, the entrance aperture is divided into seven sectors, with gratings aligned to each other\nin each sector and along the average radial direction to the optical axis. This approach generates seven spectra\nthat are reflected by seven polarizing flats to seven detectors.\nThe multilayer spacing, d, on the polarizing flats would vary laterally (along the dispersion) in order to\nprovide optimal reflection at graze angle \u03b8. Such optimization is obtained by equating the wavelength from the\nlinearized grating equation, m\u03bb = P x/DR , to that of a multilayer, \u03bb = 2d sin \u03b8, giving\nd=\n\nPx\n,\n2mDR sin \u03b8\n\n(1)\n\nwhere x is the distance along the dispersion from 0th order, DR is the Rowland diameter (the distance between\nthe gratings and the usual detector plane), and m is the grating order. Thus, the multilayer period varies\nlinearly with x, providing high reflectivity in a narrow bandpass at large graze angles. For a given order, the\nspectrometer's gratings direct a narrow bandpass to any given position on the flat, so the bandpass of the\nmultilayer can be similarly narrow. The bandpass of the multilayer decreases approximately as 1/N for a large\nnumber of layers, N , so if the spectrometer has a resolution better than 200, say, then N >\n\u223c 100. Large N also\nimproves the multilayer reflectivity.\nAt Brewster's angle, \u03b8 = 45\u25e6 , reflectivity is minimized when the E-vector is in the plane containing the\nincident ray and the surface normal (p-polarized) and maximized when the E-vector is in the surface plane\n(s-polarized). The polarization position angle (PA) is the average orientation in sky coordinates of the E-vector\nfor the incoming X-rays. Sampling at least 3 PAs is required in order to measure three Stokes parameters (I, Q,\nU) uniquely, so one would require at least three separate detector systems with accompanying multilayer-coated\nflats. For this study and for the sake of redundancy, seven detector-flat combinations are assumed.\nFollowing Marshall et al.9 and Paper I, the intensity I\u03bb at wavelength \u03bb varies with azimuthal angle \u03c6 as\nI\u03bb (\u03c6) = I\u03bb0\n\n\u001a\n\n\u001b\n1\n+ P\u03bb0 M cos (2 [\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6\u03bb ])\n,\n2\u03c0\n\n(2)\n\n\fgrating blaze\n\n01\n\na\n\nE\n\nML\nDe\n\nMir\nror\n\ne\n\na\n\ntec\ntor\n\ne\nlaze\n\ngra\nting\nb\n\nView from\nentrance aperture\n\nView from above\nfocal plane\n\nFigure 1. Left: View from the entrance aperture of a mirror with seven sectors. Gratings are placed behind the mirror with\nthe grating bars oriented along the average radius to the mirror axis. The gratings then disperse X-rays in the directions\ngiven for sectors a and e, as shown (lettering proceeding clockwise from the top central sector). The gratings are blazed,\nso the directions to the orders with highest efficiency are shown for two sectors. Right: The view above the detectors\nand polarizers. Spectra from the gratings are incident on multilayer-coated flats that are tilted along the dispersion axis\nwhich contains the zeroth order (dot in center). The angle of the tilt is the same for all mirrors and always redirects the\nX-rays to the adjacent detector in a clockwise direction. The mirror assembly would appear something like a pinwheel.\nThe detectors are tilted in the opposite direction \u2013 always oriented counterclockwise, to face the corresponding mirror.\nFor a mirror graze angle of 40\u25e6 , the detector normals would be 80\u25e6 from the optical axis. Mirrors a and b receive X-rays\nfrom the corresponding sector shown in the left side of the figure and all zeroth order light converges to the spot at the\ncenter for an on-axis source. For polarized X-rays with an electric vector as shown, the intensity at a given wavelength\ncan vary from detector to detector, as shown schematically here. In this case, long wavlengths at the perimeter are highly\nmodulated with position angle while short wavelengths, closer to the optical axis, are not modulated at all, simulating a\nwavelength-dependent polarization fraction.\n\nwhere I\u03bb0 is directly related to the I Stokes parameter of the source as a function of wavelength \u03bb, P\u03bb0 is the\npolarization fraction at this wavelength, \u03c6\u03bb is the phase determined by the orientation of average polarization\nE-vector on the sky (i.e., the polarization PA), and M\u03bb is the average system modulation factor. The modulation\nR \u2212R\nfactor is a function of wavelength, given by M = Rss +Rpp , where Rs and Rp are the reflectivities for the s and\np polarizations, respectively. The Stokes Q and U parameters can be derived from P0 and \u03c6 as a function of\nwavelength as long as there are three or more position angles that do not differ from each other by 180\u25e6 .\n\n\f2.3 System Throughput and Sensitivity\nUsing the Center for X-ray Optics web page (http://henke.lbl.gov/optical constants/multi2.html), multilayer efficiencies were computed for a small range of materials for many of the relevant graze angles and\ncorresponding d values. For this work, N was set to 200 and the interdiffusion thickness was set to 0.3 nm, as\nhas been achieved by several groups.10\u201312 Table 1 gives a sampling of the results, where r is the peak reflectivity\nto unpolarized X-rays. The thickness of the first material is 0.4d, while that of the second material is 0.6d for\neach calculation. All modulation factors are larger than 85%.\nTable 1.

The resulting effective area is shown in Fig. 2, along with the modulation factor, M .\nThe effective area estimate can be used to predict the minimum detectable polarization2 (MDP) for potential\ntargets. As described by Marshall et al,1 extragalactic sources such as the BL Lac object PKS 2155\u2212304 are\nexpected to be highly polarized in the X-ray band. In a 100,000 s observation of PKS 2155\u2212304, this instrument\ncould detect polarizations of 3-7% in each of four bandpasses 1 nm wide from 2 to 6 nm (0.21 to 0.62 keV).\nFig. 3 shows the results graphically. In addition, isolated neutron stars such as RX J0720.4\u22123125 are expected\nto polarized due to effects of photon propagation in strong magnetic fields.2 In this case, it is worthwhile to\nobtain phase-resolved polarization data. In a 200,000 s observation with this instrument, one could reach MDPs\nof 5-8% over the 2-5 nm band (in 1 nm wide bands) for each of 10 phase bins.\nThere are many combinations of elements and multilayer coating parameters that were not investigated for this\npreliminary study, so one might expect to improve upon the mulilayer-coating reflectivities. It may be possible\nto superpolish the substrates to obtain 0.1 nm roughness,13 which would increase reflectivities significantly.\n\n3. A TEST AND CALIBRATION FACILITY\nDrs. R. Heilmann and N. Schulz are currently working to fully recommission the X-ray grating evaluation facility\n(X-GEF), a 17 m beamline that was developed for testing transmission gratings fabricated at MIT for the\nChandra project.14 In addition to plans to test CAT and other types of gratings, we have proposed to add\nequipment to the facility so that it may be used for testing and calibrating components that could be used in a\nsoft X-ray polarimeter. Fig. 4 shows how it might appear when operational.\nEquipment to be added to X-GEF would include a new X-ray source with multilayer coated optics to produce\nhighly polarized X-rays at each of five X-ray emission lines (see Table 2), a grating rotation stage to simulate\ntelescope rotation, and a multilayer mirror and CCD combination acting as the polarimeter. The detector\nand its associated mirror would be mounted on a rotation stage to match the rotation of the grating so that\nthe polarization modulation factor can be measured. The detector's multilayer-coated mirror is challenging to\nfabricate but two vendors have provided quotes.\n\n\fFigure 2.

For RX J0720-31, spectroscopy allows one to obtain the\npolarization below, in, and above absorption features.\n\n\fGrating\nChamber\n\nDetector\nChamber\n\nSMD\nPSML\n\nCollimating slit\n\n0th order\n\nM5\n\n1st order\nTransmission\nGrating\n\nCCD\n\nC-K\n\nOverview, not to scale\nM5\nSMD\nPolarized\nX-rays\n\nOptic TipTilt Stage\n\nDetector\nMultilayer\nOptic\n\nO-K\nOptic\nTranslation\nDetector\nTable\nTranslation\n130 mm\nTable\n\nCCD\nDetector\nTranslation\nTable\n\nOptic TipTilt Stage\nOptic\nTranslation\nTable\n\nSide view, Detector table\n\nDetector table, source view\n\nFigure 4. Schematic of the MIT 17 m beamline after proposed modifications for soft X-ray polarimetry prototyping. Items\nin red would be added to the system. The SMDs are source monitor detectors \u2013 proportional counters that view the\nassociated Manson Model 5 source (M5). The X-ray beam is shown in light purple; a new source would be used with\nthe polarized source multilayer (PSML) angled at 45\u25e6 to pass polarized X-rays. The bottom two views are subject to\ndetailed mechanical design and stage dimensions. The dispersed, first order X-rays go to the detector multilayer optic,\nangled at 45\u25e6 to the incoming X-rays. The CCD faces the multilayer optic on a translation table that moves the CCD to\nthe location appropriate to the dispersion by the grating (Table 2). The CCD stage and its associated multilayer optic\nare mounted on a platform and can be rotated \u00b1180\u25e6 .\n\n\fACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nSupport for this work was provided by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration through the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory contract SV3-73016 to MIT for Support of the Chandra X-Ray Center, which\nis operated by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory for and on behalf of the National Aeronautics Space\nAdministration under contract NAS8-03060.\n\nREFERENCES\n1.
