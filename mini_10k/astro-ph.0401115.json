Introduction\nBased on joint analysis of BATSE LAD (Large Area\nDetector) and the EGRET TASC (Total Absorption\nShower Counter) data, Gonz\u00e1lez et al. (2003) recently reported the detection of an anomalous MeV emission component in the spectrum of GRB 941017 that decays more\nslowly than the prompt emission detected with the LAD in\nthe \u2248 50 keV \u2013 1 MeV range. The multi-MeV component\n> 200 seconds (the t\nlasts for \u223c\n90 duration of the lowerenergy prompt component is 77 sec), and is detected with\nthe BATSE LAD near 1 MeV and with the EGRET TASC\nbetween \u2248 1 and 200 MeV. The spectrum is very hard,\nwith a photon number flux \u03c6(\u01eb) \u221d \u01eb\u22121 , where \u01eb = h\u03bd/me c2\nis the observed dimensionless photon energy.\nThis component is not predicted or easily explained within the standard leptonic model for GRB\nblast waves, though it possibly could be related to\nComptonization of reverse-shock emission by the forward shock electrons (Granot and Guetta (2003)), includSend offprint requests to: C. D. Dermer\n\ning self-absorbed reverse-shock optical synchrotron radiation (Pe'er and Waxman (2004)). Another possibility is\nthat hadronic acceleration in GRB blast waves could be\nresponsible for this component.\nWe propose a model involving acceleration of hadrons\nat the relativistic shocks of GRBs. A pair-photon cascade initiated by photohadronic processes between highenergy hadrons accelerated in the GRB blast wave and\nthe internal synchrotron radiation field produces an emission component that appears during the prompt phase.\nPhotomeson interactions in the relativistic blast wave also\nproduce a beam of UHE neutrons, as proposed for blazar\njets (Atoyan and Dermer (2003)). Subsequent photopion\nproduction of these neutrons with photons outside the\nblast wave produces a directed hyper-relativistic electronpositron beam in the process of charged pion decay and\nthe conversion of high-energy photons from \u03c0 0 decay.\nThese energetic leptons produce a synchrotron spectrum\n>\nin the radiation reaction-limited regime extending to \u223c\nGeV energies, with properties in the 1 \u2013 200 MeV range\nsimilar to that measured from GRB 941017. If our model\n\n\f2\n\nDermer & Atoyan: Neutral Beam Model for GRB 941017\n\nof an electron distribution cooling by synchrotron losses,\nthat is, a photon number index between \u22121.5 and \u22122.\nDuring intervals (a) and (b) of GRB 941017 when the\nprompt hard X-ray and soft \u03b3-ray flux is brightest and\nthe high-energy spectral index is hard though not wellmeasured (Gonz\u00e1lez et al. (2003)), this component could\n> 1 MeV radiation\nmake the dominant contribution to \u223c\nfluence. The isotropic cascade radiation will decay at the\nsame rate as the synchrotron radiation, after which a second component from the ouflowing neutral beam begins\nto dominate.\n\nFig. 1. Photon energy fluence from an electromagnetic\ncascade initiated by photopion secondaries in a model\nGRB, with parameters given in the text. Five generations\nof Compton (heavy curves) and synchrotron (light curves)\nare shown. The first through fifth generations are given by\nsolid, dashed, dot-dashed, dot-triple\u2013dashed, and dotted\ncurves, respectively. The total cascade radiation spectrum\nis given by the upper bold dotted curve.\nis correct, detection of this component therefore gives important evidence for the acceleration of UHE cosmic rays\nin GRB blast waves, and would be confirmed by the detection of UHE neutrinos from GRBs.\n\n2. Hadronic Model for GRB 941017\nWe assume that efficient proton acceleration to ultrarelativistic energies takes place in GRB blast waves, as required in models where GRBs accelerate high-energy cosmic rays (Vietri (1995), Waxman (1995), Dermer (2002)).\nPhotopion interactions of these protons with internal synchrotron photons and with photons from an external radiation field create neutral particles and charged pions that\ndecay and initiate an electromagnetic cascade within the\nGRB blast wave.\nDuring the prompt emission phase, an additional component of radiation is produced by the cascade occurring within the blast wave. Fig. 1 shows the hadroninitiated cascade radiation for a model GRB at redshift z = 1, with hard X-ray fluence \u03a6tot = 3 \u00d7\n10\u22124 erg cm\u22122 , a light curve of 100 second duration divided into 50 pulses of 1 second each, and\nDoppler factor \u03b4 = 100 (see Atoyan and Dermer (2003),\nDermer and Atoyan (2003) for more details about the\nmodel). The total amount of accelerated proton energy\nE \u2032 = 4\u03c0d2L \u03a6tot \u03b4 \u22123 (1 + z)\u22121 is injected into the comoving\nframe of the GRB blast wave.\nThe various generations of synchrotron and Compton\nradiation initiated by the cascade are shown in Fig. 1,\nalong with the total radiation spectrum. As can be seen,\nthe isotropic cascade radiation approaches the spectrum\n\nUltra-relativistic neutrons formed in the reaction p +\n\u03b3 \u2192 n + \u03c0 0 are not confined by the magnetic field in\nthe GRB blastwave shell and flow out to create an energetic neutron beam. These neutrons are subject to further photopion processes with photons in the surrounding\nmedium to form charged and neutral pions. In the Gausstype magnetic fields surrounding GRB sources that we\n< 1018 eV deassume here, charged \u03c0 and \u03bc at energies \u223c\ncay rather than lose energy through synchrotron emission\n(Rachen and M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros (1998)). The charged pions decay\ninto ultrarelativistic electrons and neutrinos, whereas the\ndecay of \u03c0 0 produces two \u03b3 rays that are promptly converted into electron-positron pairs on this same external radiation field. These energetic electrons (including\npositrons) are initially produced in the direction of the\nGRB jet.\nThe spectra of secondary electrons created by the neu< 1014 eV as\ntron beam displays a sharp cutoff at energies \u223c\na consequence of the high threshold for photomeson interactions (see calculations in Dermer and Atoyan (2003)).\nElectrons with Lorentz factor \u03b3 lose energy through synchrotron radiation in an ordered magnetic field with\nstrength B at the rate \u2212d\u03b3/dt = \u03c3T B 2 \u03b3 2 sin2 \u03c8/(4\u03c0me c),\nwhere \u03c8 is the electron pitch angle. The corresponding\nsynchrotron energy-loss time scale tsyn = \u03b3/|d\u03b3/dt|. The\ngyration frequency \u03c9B = eB/\u03b3me c, and is independent of\npitch angle. When \u03c9B tsyn \u226a 1, the electron loses almost\nall of its energy into synchrotron radiation in a time less\nthan the gyroperiod. We use the term \"hyper-relativistic\"\nto refer to electrons in this radiation-reaction regime\nof synchrotron emission (Nelson and Wasserman (1991),\nAloisio and Blasi (2002)).\nElectrons which cool before being deflected by an angle \u03b8 equal to the jet opening angle \u03b8j will emit most of\ntheir energy within \u03b8j . The pitch angle \u03c8 does not change\nin the process of synchrotron losses when \u03b3 \u226b 1. Then\ncos \u03b8 = cos2 \u03c8 + sin2 \u03c8 cos \u03c6, where \u03c6 = \u03c9B t is the rotation angle. In the limit of small \u03b8 and \u03c6, \u03b8 \u223c\n= \u03c6 sin \u03c8.\nThe condition \u03b8 \u2264 \u03b8j for times p\nt \u2264 tsyn then results\n> \u03b3 (\u03b8 ) =\n4\u03c0e/(\u03b8j \u03c3T B sin \u03c8) \u223c\nin the condition \u03b3 \u223c\n=\nhr j\np\n8\n3 \u00d7 10 /[ (\u03b8j /0.1)B(G) sin \u03c8] for the hyper-relativistic\nelectrons. Here we have taken a typical jet opening halfangle \u03b8j = 0.1 because this is the average value implied by\nthe analysis leading to the standard energy reservoir result of GRBs (Frail et al. (2001)). Lower-energy electrons\n\n\fDermer & Atoyan: Neutral Beam Model for GRB 941017\n\nwith \u03b3 < \u03b3hr (\u03b8j ) radiate their energy over a much larger\nsolid angle.\nThe mean energy E\u03b3 \u2261 me c2 \u01eb = Ej of synchrotron\nphotons emitted by electrons with \u03b3 \u2243 \u03b3hr (\u03b8j ) is independent of \u03c8 and B, and is given by\n2\n(\u03b8j ) \u223c\n500\nh\u0304eB sin \u03c8 \u03b3hr\nMeV , (1)\nEj \u223c\n=\n=\nme c\n(1 + z)\n(\u03b8j /0.1)[(1 + z)/2]\n\nHyper-relativistic electrons with \u03b3 > \u03b3hr (\u03b8j ) rapidly lose\nenergy through synchrotron losses and deposit all of their\nenergy along the direction of the jet.

Hence the distribution\nof electrons along the jet direction always has an effective\nlow-energy cutoff at \u03b3hr (\u03b8j ). The production spectrum of\nthe electrons can have an intrinsic cutoff \u03b3co due either to\nthe low-energy cutoff in the escaping neutron spectrum, or\nto the neutron-induced photomeson secondary spectrum\noutside the GRB blast wave. If \u03c1 \u2261 \u03b3co /\u03b3hr (\u03b8j ) > 1,\nthen the observed synchrotron spectrum is a power law\n< E < \u03c12 E , and a photon specwith \u22121.5 index for Ej \u223c\nj\n\u03b3 \u223c\ntrum with the same spectral index as the accelerated pro> \u03c12 E\ntons and escaping neutrons at photon energies E\u03b3 \u223c\nj\n(Nelson and Wasserman (1991)). If \u03c1 < 1, then the ob> E has the same spectral\nserved photon spectrum at E\u03b3 \u223c\nj\nindex as the primary neutrons.\nAt photon energies E\u03b3 \u226a Ej , the observed spectrum\nis produced by the same hyper-relativistic electrons with\n> \u03b3 (\u03b8 ), but at energies \u01eb well below the peak energy\n\u03b3\u223c\nhr j\n3\u03b3 2 \u01ebB , where \u01ebB \u2261 B/Bcr and Bcr = 4.41 \u00d7 1013 G is the\ncritical magnetic field. We now derive this spectrum.\nThe differential energy radiated per dimensionless energy interval d\u01eb per differential solid angle element d\u03a9 in\nthe direction \u03b8 with respect to the direction of an electron\nmoving with Lorentz factor \u03b3 is given by\n\u01eb 2\ne2\ndE\n(\n) (1 + \u03b3 2 \u03b82 )2 (\u039bk + \u039b\u22a5 ) ,\n=\nd\u01ebd\u03a9\n3\u03c0 2 \u03bb\u0304C \u03b3\u01ebB\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03bb\u0304C = h\u0304/me c = 3.86 \u00d7 10\u221211 cm is the elec2\ntron Compton wavelength, and \u039bk = K2/3\n(\u03be) and \u039b\u22a5 =\n2 2\n2\n(\u03b3\u03b8) K1/3 (\u03be)/[1 + (\u03b3\u03b8) ] are factors for radiation polarized parallel and perpendicular to the projection of the\nmagnetic field direction on the plane of the sky defined\nby the observer's direction (Jackson (1975)). The factor\n\u03be = \u01eb/\u01eb\u0302, where \u01eb\u0302 = 3\u01ebB \u03b3 2 /(1 + \u03b3 2 \u03b82 )3/2 , and Kn (x) is a\nmodified Bessel function of the second kind, with asymptotes Kn (x) \u2192 12 \u0393(n)(2/x)n in the limit x \u226a 1, and\np\nKn (x) \u2192 \u03c0/2x exp(\u2212x) in the limit x \u226b 1. The condition \u03be \u226a 1 corresponds to \u01eb \u226a \u01eb\u0302 where Kn (\u03be) are in\n>\n>\ntheir power-law asymptotes, and \u03be \u223c\n1 or \u01eb \u223c\n\u01eb\u0302 is where\nKn (\u03be) are in exponential decline. The characteristic energy \u01eb\u0302 approaches 3\u01ebB \u03b3 2 when \u03b3\u03b8 \u226a 1, and \u01eb\u0302 declines\nwith \u03b8 according to the relation \u01eb\u0302 \u223c\n= 3\u01ebB \u03b3 2 /(\u03b3\u03b8)3 when\n\u03b3\u03b8 \u226b 1.

For a fixed value of\n> 3\u01eb /\u03b3\u03b8 3 ,\n\u01eb, this emissivity exponentially cuts off when \u01eb \u223c\nB\n1/3\n>\nor when \u03b8 \u223c \u03b8max = (3\u01ebB /\u03b3\u01eb) .\n\n3\n\nThe synchrotron emission spectrum at energies E\u03b3 \u226a\nEj , integrated over solid angle, is thus\ndE\n\u2243 2\u03c0\nd\u01eb\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n(3\u01ebB /\u03b3\u01eb)1/3\n\nd\u03b8\u03b8 (\n\ndE\n3e2\n\u221d \u01eb0 .\n)\u2243\nd\u01ebd\u03a9\n\u03c0 \u03bb\u0304C\n\n(3)\n\nThis differs from the energy index +1/3 for synchrotron\nradiation radiated by electrons in the classical regime, because in this case one integrates over a complete orbit of\nan electron (Rybicki and Lightman (1979)).

Neutron Beams from GRBs\nIn our model, ultrarelativistic protons undergo photomeson interactions with internal and external radiation photons, producing a beam of outflowing neutrons.\nSubsequent interactions of these neutrons with photons\nof the external radiation field generate a beam of hyper> 1 MeV emission during the\nrelativistic electrons. The \u223c\nprompt phase is mainly cascade radiation produced within\nthe GRB shell, while the emission induced by the neutron beam is formed at later times. This interpretation\nrequires that the fluence of photohadronic cascade radiation within the shell exceed by a factor of order unity\nthe cascade fluence induced by the neutral beam radiation, consistent with observations. At later times, as shown\nabove, synchrotron radiation from the hyper-relativistic\nelectrons has a low-energy cutoff at E\u03b3 < Ej \u223c 0.5\nGeV, with a specific characteristic power-law number\nspectral index equal to \u22121, as observed for GRB 941017\n(Gonz\u00e1lez et al. (2003)).\nThe \u2248 200 s decay time of the anomalous emission can\nbe explained by the projected thickness \u2243 R(1 \u2212 cos \u03b8j )\nof the emitting region from the front to the edges of a jet\nblastwave at distances R \u2248 6\u00d71014(\u03b8j /0.1)\u22122 [(1+z)/2]\u22121\ncm from the central source, implying significant opacity\nto photomeson processes due to external photons at these\ndistances. Note that hyper-relativistic electrons can make\na substantial contribution to emission at \u03b8 \u2248 \u03b8j \u226b 1/\u0393,\nwhere \u0393 is the GRB blastwave Lorentz factor.\nThe external radiation field could be due\nto plerionic emission in the supranova model\n(K\u00f6nigl and Granot (2002)), or to GRB synchrotron\nphotons that are backscattered by stellar wind electrons\nin the collapsar model (Beloborodov (2002)). We estimate\nthe effective photomeson energy-loss scattering depth\n\u03c4n\u03b3 for neutrons in the collapsar-model case, and show\nthat it implies a size scale of the back-scattering material\nin accord with the radius inferred from the duration of\nthe anomalous component.

The expression for\nphoton fluence is written in terms of the energy fluence\n\u03c6 = 10\u22124 \u03c6\u22124 ergs cm\u22122 from a GRB at luminosity\ndistance dL = 1028 d28 cm.\nThe stellar wind outflow rate \u1e40 = 10\u22124 \u1e40\u22124 M\u2299 /yr\nand wind speed v = 2000v2000 km s\u22121 are scaled\nto the properties of the winds of Wolf-Rayet stars\n(Lozinskaya (1992)), which are likely GRB progenitors.\nThis implies a Thomson depth \u03c4T \u223c\n= 0.01\u1e40\u22124/R14 v2000 ,\n3\nv2000 ] at scales\nso that \u03c4n\u03b3 \u2248 d228 \u03c6\u22124 \u1e40\u22124 /[h\u01ebi(1 + z)R14\nR. Equating the restriction on radius following from\n> 1 with the relation on R from\nthe requirement \u03c4n\u03b3 \u223c\nduration for z = 1 and d28 = 2.2 implies \u03b8j \u223c\n=\n0.14[(h\u01ebi/0.1)v2000 /\u03c6\u22124 \u1e40\u22124 ]1/6 , which is a typical jet\nopening angle. The differing GRB external radiation and\ndensity environments which determine the intensity of target photons could account for the unusual spectrum of\nGRB 941017.\nThe fluence in the anomalous MeV component of GRB\n>\n3\u00d7 larger than the prompt emission fluence.\n941017 is \u223c\nIf the anomalous fluence is assumed to originate from pho> 1 order\ntopion processes from nonthermal protons, then \u223c\nof magnitude more energy should be available in hadrons\nthan electrons to produce these fluence ratios, when account is taken of losses to neutrinos and inefficient extraction of proton energy. The neutral beam model interpretation therefore requires that the accelerated particles\nin, at least, GRB 941017 are hadronically dominated by\n>\n\u223c 1 order of magnitude, consistent with predictions linking cosmic rays to GRB sources (Wick et al. (2003)).\nThe neutron beam can take up to \u2248 30 \u2013 50% of the\naccelerated proton energy, with an equal amount of power\ngoing into neutrinos, gamma rays and electrons. At later\nstages when the internal photon field disappears, the cascade induced by electrons in the blast wave is suppressed\nas a consequence of the strong Klein-Nishina effects on \u03b3\u03b3\nphoto-absorption for the external radiation, which is contributed mostly by backscattered prompt X-rays and MeV\n\u03b3 rays. But the backscattered radiation field still remains\neffective for photohadronic processes with UHE protons\nthat continue to be accelerated in the GRB blast wave after the decline of the prompt emission. Note that such\nan environment satisfies requirements for acceleration\nby external shocks (Vietri, De Marco, & Guetta (2003)),\nand for acceleration through the converter mechanism\n(Derishev, et al. (2003)). Because the opacity to \u03b3\u03b3 absorption is small for UHE \u03b3 rays from \u03c0 0 decay, these \u03b3\nrays will escape from the blast wave and contribute to the\nneutral beam power at later stages directly.\nIn conjunction with the neutral beam power is the\nprediction of a very significant fluence of UHE neutrinos. From GRBs with anomalous \u03b3-ray components\nand large fluences (the fluence of GRB 941017, includ> 6.5 \u00d7 10\u22124 ergs\ning the anomalous component, is \u223c\n\u22122\ncm ), we predict several \u03bd\u03bc events detectable with\n\nan IceCube-class km-scale telescope from this type of\nevent, in agreement with phenomenological inferences by\nAlvarez-Mu\u00f1iz, et al. (2003).\nIn summary, we have proposed a hadronic model\nfor the anomalous radiation component in GRB 941017.\nDuring the prompt phase, this emission originates from\ncascade radiation within the GRB blast wave. The anomalous component in the extended phase is synchrotron radiation from hyper-relativistic electrons formed by the associated neutron beam escaping from the blast wave. The\nradiation components are well-suited for observations with\nthe GBM and LAT on GLAST. GRBs with anomalous \u03b3ray emission components should also be bright neutrino\nsources detectable with IceCube.\nAcknowledgements. Discussions with M. Gonz\u00e1lez, B. Dingus,\nA.
