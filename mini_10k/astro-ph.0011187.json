The dominant\nversion from clusters is the thermal SZ effect, the gain in\nenergy acquired from the thermal motion of the gas which\nis commonly at a temperature of tens of millions of degrees\nin clusters. The kinetic SZ effect is the Doppler shift arising\nfrom the bulk motion of the gas.\nThe thermal effect has been quite well studied theoretically, and recently has become a burgeoning area of observational activity with the construction of two-dimensional\nmaps of clusters becoming commonplace (Jones et al. 1993;\nMyers et al. 1997; Carlstrom et al. 2000). By contrast, less\nattention has been given to the kinetic effect. It presents\na considerable observational challenge, because it is predicted to be much smaller than the thermal effect on the\nangular scales explored so far, and also because unlike the\nthermal effect it possesses no characteristic spectral signature allowing it to be distinguished from primary cosmic\nmicrowave background anisotropies. It is also more difficult to make semi-analytic calculations. The thermal effect can be obtained fairly directly via the Press\u2013Schechter\nc 0000 RAS\n\n(1974) approach; various aspects including number counts,\nthe global CMB distortion, and its impact as secondary\nanisotropy for CMB measurements at small scales have been\nextensively studied (Cole & Kaiser 1988; Colafrancesco et\nal. 1994, 1997; Bartlett & Silk 1994; Barbosa et al. 1996;\nEke, Cole & Frenk 1996; Aghanim et al. 1997; Komatsu &\nKitayama 1999; Atrio-Barandela & M\u00fccket 1999; Molnar &\nBirkinshaw 2000; Hern\u00e1ndez-Monteagudo, Atrio-Barandela\n& M\u00fccket 2000). Predictions for the kinetic effect require\nthe simultaneous estimation of both mass and peculiar velocity, and the signal is much less dominated by the gas\nwhich happens to be in massive halos. A detailed analytical\nmodel has recently been constructed by Valageas, Balbi &\nSilk (2000) [see also Benson et al. 2000], which computes the\neffect including inhomogeneities in reionization; this supersedes earlier modelling by Aghanim et al. (1997) where the\npeculiar velocities were drawn from a gaussian distribution\nof fixed width.\nWe recently used large-scale hydrodynamical N -body\nsimulations to make simulated maps of the thermal effect\nand analyzed their properties (da Silva et al. 2000; for similar recent work see Refregier et al. 2000a; Seljak, Burwell\n& Pen 2000; Springel, White & Hernquist 2000). In this\npaper, we make a detailed analysis of maps of the kinetic\neffect, made using the same technique. Recently Springel\n\n\f2\n\nA. C. da Silva et al.\n\net al. (2000) used similar simulations to study the angular power spectrum of the kinetic effect in the \u039bCDM cosmology, and investigated the influence of non-gravitational\nheating upon it. In this paper we study three different cosmologies, and investigate a wide range of properties of the\nresulting maps including the relation between thermal and\nkinetic distortion.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nTHE KINETIC SZ EFFECT\nLinear and non-linear effects\n\nTraditionally, the phrase \"kinetic SZ effect\" is associated\nwith the scattering of photons from galaxy clusters or other\nlarge gravitationally-bound objects. However, in simulations\nthere is no clear distinction between this and the scattering\nfrom any other moving gas, and when we construct maps\nthey will be based on the bulk motions of all the material in the simulation box. However, one should recognize\nthat part of this signal is computable in linear perturbation theory, and is for example computed in a run of the\ncmbfast program (Seljak & Zaldarriaga 1996) for a cosmology with reionization, where it is called the low-redshift\nDoppler effect. These different regimes, and their relation\nto the Ostriker\u2013Vishniac effect (Ostriker & Vishniac 1986),\nhave been discussed in detailed by Hu (2000) and by Gnedin\n& Jaffe (2000), and observational aspects are described by\nCooray & Hu (2000).\nConcerning the contribution from non-linear evolution,\none should recognize that while there are non-linear contributions to the velocities, of particular importance is the\nnon-linear evolution of the density field. This concentrates\nthe matter into a virialized region which gives a high optical depth probe of the bulk velocity at that point. The\nnon-linear effect is more important at low redshifts.\n\n2.2\n\nsmaller. Indeed, we will see that, unlike the thermal SZ signal, the kinetic SZ signal is not convergent and results are\nmildly dependent on the assumed redshift of reionization\n(though this is certainly not the largest uncertainty in our\ncalculations). For ease of comparison between cosmologies,\nwe will assume that reionization took place at redshift 10,\nwhich satisfies all existing observations (see e.g. Griffiths\net al. 1999; Haiman & Knox 1999), independent of the cosmology even though detailed calculations would favour later\nreionization in the high-density case.\n\nThe reionization epoch\n\nPhotons only scatter at epochs where the gas is ionized.\nReionization is thought to be induced by radiation from\nthe first generation of massive stars in dwarf galaxies (see\nHaiman & Knox 1999 for a review), which unfortunately are\nwell below our numerical resolution. Bruscoli et al. (1999)\nand Gnedin & Jaffe (2000) have modelled reionization using\nvery small-scale high-resolution simulations, probing a range\nof angular scales complementary to our own, and compute\nthe corresponding microwave anisotropies. We will not consider inhomogeneous reionization in this paper (see Aghanim\net al. 1996; Grusinov & Hu 1998; Knox, Scoccimarro & Dodelson 1998; Benson et al. 2000; Valageas et al. 2000), and\nwe will treat the epoch of reionization as an independent parameter. According to Gnedin & Jaffe (2000), anisotropies\nfrom inhomogeneous reionization will be subdominant on\nthe scales we consider, especially if massive stars are indeed\nresponsible for reionization.\nFor the thermal SZ effect the epoch of reionization is irrelevant, as significant signals only come from low redshifts\nand from regions hot enough to be fully ionized. This is no\nlonger true for the kinetic effect, where the increased density of material at high redshift (per observed solid angle)\nmaintains a significant signal even though the velocities are\n\n2.3\n\nThe equations\n\nThe thermal SZ effect in a given direction is computed as a\nline integral, which gives the Compton y-parameter as (Sunyaev & Zel'dovich 1972, 1980)\ny=\n\nZ\n\nkB \u03c3 T\nTe ne dl .\nme c2\n\n(1)\n\nIn this expression Te and ne are the temperature and number density of the electrons, kB the Boltzmann constant, \u03c3T\nthe Thomson cross-section, c the speed of light and me the\nelectron rest mass. The frequency dependence of the effect is\nwell documented (e.g. Birkinshaw 1999); ignoring relativistic corrections, it gives a temperature fluctuation\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n\u2206Tth\nx\n=y\n\u22124 .\nT\ntanh(x/2)\n\n(2)\n\nwhere x = h\u03bd/kB T is the dimensionless frequency and\nT the radiation temperature. In the long-wavelength limit\nx \u226a 1 (the Rayleigh\u2013Jeans portion of the spectrum) we have\n\u2206Tth /T \u2243 \u22122y, and the thermal effect has a null point at\nx \u2243 3.83, corresponding to \u03bd \u2243 217 GHz.\nWhenever the gas has a peculiar velocity in the CMB\nradiation frame, there is a kinematic Doppler effect in addition to heating from the random thermal motions of the\nelectrons. The change in the spectral intensity due to the\nkinetic effect is (Sunyaev & Zel'dovich 1980)\n\u2206I\u03bd = \u2212I0 h(x)\n\nvr\n\u03c4\nc\n\n(3)\n\n3 3\nwhere I0 = 2kB\nT /h2 c2 , vr is the line-of-sight velocity of the\ngas (positive/negative when receding/approaching), h(x) is\ngiven by\n\nh(x) =\n\nx 4 ex\n,\n(ex \u2212 1)2\n\n(4)\n\nand \u03c4 is the optical depth\n\u03c4=\n\nZ\n\n\u03c3T ne dl .\n\n(5)\n\nThe temperature fluctuation due to the kinetic effect is\n\u2206Tk\nvr\n=\u2212 \u03c4 =\u2212\nT\nc\n\nZ\n\nvr\n\u03c3T ne dl ,\nc\n\n(6)\n\nwhich, in contrast to the thermal effect, is a frequencyindependent quantity. As such, the kinetic effect cannot be\ndistinguished from primary microwave anisotropies on the\nbasis of its spectral dependence.\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fThe kinetic Sunyaev\u2013Zel'dovich effect\n3\n\nTHE MAPS\n\nFor full details as to the construction of maps, see da Silva\net al. (2000). The starting ingredient is a set of three hydrodynamical simulations, one for each of three cosmologies.\n\nterest. We construct maps of the individual simulation boxes\nin our stacking, which are then added to give the final maps.\n\n4\n\u2022 \u039bCDM: a low-density model with a flat spatial geometry and \u03a90 = 0.35 and \u03a9\u039b = 0.65.\n\u2022 \u03c4 CDM: a critical-density model with \u03a90 = 1 and\n\u03a9\u039b = 0.\n\u2022 OCDM: a low-density open model with \u03a90 = 0.35 and\n\u03a9\u039b = 0.\nThe simulations were carried out using the public domain\nHydra code (Adaptive P3 M-SPH: Couchman, Thomas &\nPearce 1995). In each case the box-size was 150 h\u22121 Mpc,\nand equal numbers of dark matter and gas particles were\nused.\nTo construct a map we stack simulation output boxes,\nwith random translations and reorientations, to reach high\nredshift. Outputs from the simulations were made at different epochs so that they can be stacked smoothly into\nan evolving sequence. Typically around 35 boxes need to\nbe stacked to reach to redshift 10; however at the redshifts\nfrom which the bulk of the signal arises only a small fraction of the volume of the box contributes to the maps and\nso we are not limited by cosmic variance in having only a\nsingle hydrodynamical simulation. For each cosmology we\nmake 30 different maps, corresponding to different random\norientations of the stacked simulations.\nTo compute the thermal and kinetic effects we follow\nthe approach described in da Silva et al. (2000). In the simulations each gas particle occupies a volume with radius proportional to its SPH smoothing radius, hi , inside which the\nmass profile is taken as mgas W (r \u2212 ri , hi ), where ri is the\nposition of the particle's centre, mgas is the mass of the\ngas particle and W is the normalized spherically\u2013symmetric\nsmoothing kernel.\nThe quantities we are interested in mapping are y and\n\u2206Tk /T . To do this we first convert the line-of-sight integrations in equations (1) and (6) into volume integrals over\nspace. The resulting expressions are then discretized into cubic cells of volume V (voxels), which are stacked along the\nline of sight to produce pixels of area A. The total temperature distortion induced by the kinetic effect in each pixel of\nthe map can then be evaluated as\n\u2206Tk\n\u03c3T V 0.88 mgas X X\nvr,i W (|r\u03b1 \u2212 ri | , hi ) , (7)\n=\u2212\nT\nc A\nmp\ni\n\n\u03b1\n\nand likewise for the thermal SZ y-parameter\ny=\n\nkB \u03c3T V 0.88 mgas X X\nTi W (|r\u03b1 \u2212 ri | , hi ) ,\nme c2 A\nmp\ni\n\n(8)\n\n3\n\nRESULTS\n\nTypical example maps in each cosmology are shown in Figure 1, with the same colour scale in each.\u22c6 The original\nmaps have been smoothed using a gaussian with a full-width\nhalf-maximum (FWHM) of 1\u2032 . Unlike the thermal maps, the\nkinetic maps show positive and negative temperature fluctuations. The low-density maps (top and bottom panels)\npresent stronger fluctuations than the critical density ones\n(centre panels). The brightest objects in the thermal maps\ndo not necessarily correspond to the largest kinetic distortions (and vice-versa). However, bright thermal sources often\nreveal neighboring kinetic peaks of opposite signs (Diaferio,\nSunyaev & Nusser 2000), resulting from mergings of substructures or rotational flows within the sources. This can\nbe seen, for example, corresponding to the two brightest objects of the thermal \u039bCDM map and in the bright source on\nthe lower right corner of the OCDM map. These objects are\nat redshifts z=1.7, 1.8, and 1.9 respectively. Fainter superclusters at lower redshifts also produce similar signatures\n(see animations of individual maps on our WWW page),\nbut their contribution to the final map tends to be erased\nby the box stacking process. Although the kinetic effect has\nno spectral signature, the search for these characteristic positive/negative features in the SZ flux of bright sources and\nnearby super-clusters may prove to be an additional aid in\nisolating the kinetic effect in future SZ measurements and\nin identifying super-clusters at cosmological distances (see\nDiaferio et al. 2000).\n\n4.1\n\nThe redshift dependence\n\nIn order to test how well the calculation of the effects converges p\nwith redshift, Figure 2 shows the rms distortion,\n\u03c3k =\nh(\u2206Tk /T )2 i, in the 1 arcminute resolution maps\nconstructed out to redshift z, as a function of that redshift.\nUnlike the dispersion of the thermal effect, shown in Figure 3, the integrated kinetic signal is not strongly convergent to high redshift, with the smaller velocities being compensated by the increased amount of material contributing.\nIn the real Universe the signal is cut off by the epoch of\nreionization, and as can be seen our results are modestly\ndependent on that choice (though other uncertainties such\nas the normalization of the matter power spectrum will be\nmore significant). As advertised in Section 2, we choose to\nconstruct maps with data out to redshift 10 in each cosmology.\n\n\u03b1\n\nwhere the i index runs over all particles which contribute to\nthe pixel columns, and the \u03b1 index is over the line-of-sight\ncubes.

At low resolutions (5 arcminutes\nor worse) the curves are close to gaussian distributed for all\nintensities, whereas at higher resolution marked nongaussian\ntails are present from non-linear structures. These nonlinear\ntails represent the best hope for observing the effect directly.\nAs expected the pixel distribution mean values are very close\nto zero.\nThese pixel distributions are quite discouraging for attempts to detect the kinetic effect from individual sources\nwith the Planck satellite, whose best resolution is about five\narcminutes. We see that the pixel distribution at such resolution is well approximated by a gaussian even for the rarest\nevents we see, with no non-gaussian tail of bright rare events.\nThe rms dispersion is very small compared to the expected\nlevel of primary anisotropies on those scales, and so the kinetic effect will not be detectable directly without some external information as to where to look to see it. Later in\nthis paper, we shall consider the use of the thermal effect\nas an indicator of where to look for the kinetic effect. This\ncan allow a statistical measure of the cluster velocity field\n(Aghanim et al. 1997; see also Haehnelt & Tegmark 1996;\nHobson et al. 1998). Indeed, the MAP and Planck missions\ncould allow the overall detection of the cosmic bulk flow\nwhen coupled with X-ray observations (Kashlinsky & AtrioBarandela 2000).\n\n\f6\n\nA.

The dashed lines show gaussian fits to\nthe distributions.\n\n4.4\n\nThe angular power spectrum\n\nWe calculate the power spectrum using the flat-sky approximation in the usual way; see e.g. Peacock (1999). In Figure 5\nwe show the thermal and kinetic SZ angular power spectra\nobtained from simulations for the three cosmologies, with\nthe Cl band averaged into logarithmic bins in the Fourier\nspace.\nThe power spectra shown are averages over the thirty\nmaps we made for each cosmology. To estimate the statistical error we used bootstrap resampling of the thirty maps,\nwhich gave a range of estimates indicated at 68 per cent\nconfidence by the dotted lines (note that the map-to-map\nvariations are of course much bigger than the variation in\nthe bootstrap resamples of thirty maps each). For the two\nlow-density cosmologies we see that the statistical errors\nare small, while for the critical-density thermal case even\nthirty maps leaves a significant residual error, because the\nmaps tend to be dominated by the presense or absence of\nsingle bright features. Unfortunately computer time limitations prevent us increasing the number of maps used to make\nthe estimate, and from running more sets of hydrodynamical simulations to remove possible correlations from using a\nsingle set.\nFrom Figure 5 we see that the low-density models\npresent similar shapes and amplitudes for the thermal and\nkinetic angular power spectra. In the critical-density case\nboth effects produce less power at all scales, which can be\nexplained by there being fewer objects along the line of\nsight for this model. On large angular scales, the thermal Cl\ncurves typically exceed the kinetic ones by a factor of about\n25 for all cosmologies. On smaller scales (l >\n\u223c 2000) the gap\nbetween the thermal and kinetic power spectrum increases\nslowly in the low-density models, whereas in the \u03c4 CDM\nmodel it decreases rapidly as the thermal Cl curve falls\nwith l. This can be understood if we take into account that\nalthough the simulations are normalized to give the same\nabundance of objects at redshift zero, in the low-density\nmodels there are SZ sources visible to much higher redshifts.\nAs we will see below, on small angular scales the thermal SZ\n\nFigure 5. In each panel, we see the primary CMB, thermal SZ\nand kinetic SZ angular power spectra obtained for each cosmology. From top to bottom we have \u039bCDM, \u03c4 CDM and OCDM,\nrespectively.

The dotted lines indicate 1-sigma errors, obtained by\nbootstrap resampling the thirty map realizations.\n\nspectrum receives strong contributions from sources above\nredshift one. The lack of distant sources in the \u03c4 CDM model\nis then reflected in the thermal SZ power spectrum by a\nstrong reduction of power on these scales.\nIn the \u039bCDM cosmology the amplitude of the thermal\nSZ power spectrum becomes comparable to the power specc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fThe kinetic Sunyaev\u2013Zel'dovich effect\n\n7\n\nFigure 7.

The redshift dependence of the power spectrum of the\nkinetic effect is shown in the upper panel, with the lower panel\nshowing the thermal effect for comparison. In each case, the spectrum is shown for the accumulated signal from redshifts greater\nthan a given value. These plots refer to the \u039bCDM simulation.\n\ntrum of the primary CMB around l = 2000. This prediction\nagrees with earlier results from numerical simulations (Refregier et al. 2000a; Seljak et al. 2000; Springel et al. 2000)\nand confirms that the SZ power spectrum should not be\nan important source of contamination for MAP (its amplitude is well below the projected noise for this mission, see\nRefregier et al. 2000a,b), whereas it should be detectable\nby Planck and other experiments probing smaller angular\nscales\nFigure 6 shows the dependence of the thermal and kinetic angular power spectra with redshift. We see that the\nkinetic effect has had a much weaker dependence on redshift\n(for l \u2243 2000 about 15 per cent of the power has origin above\nz > 7.5), and indeed, while sub-dominant now, was dominant at redshifts earlier than about three. On large angular\nscales, the thermal power spectrum is clearly dominated by\nsources at low redshifts. More than two-thirds of the power\non these scales is generated at redshifts z < 1, whereas on\nsmall scales the majority of the signal is produced above\nredshift 1. On intermediate scales there is still a reasonable\nfraction of power with origin above z = 1; for instance at\nl = 2000 that fraction is about 50 per cent.\nIn general our results show broad agreement with the\nSZ power spectra obtained from numerical simulations by\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\nRefregier et al. (2000a), Seljak et al. (2000) and Springel et\nal. (2000). In the first two cases the authors have also studied\nthree CDM models, but made no predictions for the kinetic\nSZ power spectrum. In Springel et al. (2000) the angular\npower spectrum is computed for both effects, but results are\nonly reported for the \u039bCDM cosmology. After taking into\naccount the difference between simulations on \u03c38 and \u03a9B h\nwe find that the thermal spectra agree quite well on large\nangular scales. In particular, our thermal \u039bCDM spectrum\nagrees remarkably well with Springel et al. (2000) for a wide\nrange of l (the difference is within 20 per cent for l <\n\u223c1200).\nThis is an encouraging result as all simulations should agree\non these scales (as shown in Refregier et al. 2000a, the finite\nsize of the simulation boxes has very little influence on the\nSZ power spectrum).\nOn small angular scales different simulations give rather\ndifferent results for the thermal effect. Generally speaking\nour simulations predict less power than Springel et al. (2000)\nand more power than Refregier et al. (2000a) and Seljak et\nal. (2000). However, in the critical-density case our thermal curve peaks before and falls faster than the lower limit\nfor the spectrum reported by Refregier et al. (2000a). The\nfact that Springel et al. (2000) predict more power on these\nscales is most likely reflecting the higher resolution of their\nsimulations.\nThe only available results for comparison of the kinetic\nspectra are those of Springel et al. (2000) for the \u039bCDM cosmology. The agreement between simulations is not as good\nas in the thermal case, as the shapes of the kinetic curves\ndiffer on large scales. Our simulations predict about \u223c 3.5\ntimes less power at l \u2243 400. However simulations show good\nagreement in the range 1000 <\n\u223c 2000. Different assump\u223cl<\ntions concerning the ionization history of the gas may be the\nmain source of differences in the spectra at very high l.\n4.5\n\nKinetic effect versus thermal effect\n\nGiven the smallness of the kinetic effect, it is advantageous\nto have an idea where on the sky to look in order to see it.\nSuch a guide is given by the thermal effect, which indicates\nlocations where gravitational collapse has concentrated scat-\n\n\f8\n\nA.

Figure 7 is a pixel-by-pixel scatter plot of\nthe kinetic effect versus the thermal effect, found in a single\nmap of the \u039bCDM simulation. The kinetic signal is roughly\nsymmetric around zero and its dispersion increases for the\npixels with higher thermal distortions. The 'tendrils' are the\npixels associated with particular large bright features in the\nmaps.\nAn interesting question is what values of kinetic distortion are expected at locations with a given thermal distortion, and this is shown in Figure 8. We binned the pixels\nof all thirty \u039bCDM maps according to their thermal values\nand studied the distribution of kinetic distortions. As long\nas the distortion is not too large, these distributions are well\napproximated by gaussians of width \u03c3k as shown in the figure, the brighter thermal sources corresponding typically to\nlarger kinetic distortions. This enhancement at locations of\nlarger thermal signal is what allows a statistical detection\nof the magnitude of the kinetic effect (Haehnelt & Tegmark\n1996; Aghanim et al. 1997) and may allow detections in\nsome rare bright objects. For a discussion of identifying the\nkinetic effect through the component separation process, see\nHobson et al. (1998).\nA similar exercise can be carried out for identified\nsources rather than pixels. To mimic typical observational\nprocedures, we first subtract the mean signal from the thermal maps. We then identify source locations in the thermal maps using the SExtractor package (Bertin & Arnouts\n1996), and determine the total thermal flux of the sources\n(at a given frequency channel) by adding up the flux in all\ncontiguous pixels until the pixel intensity falls below half\nthe maximum. In order to reduce source confusion effects\nwe only consider bright resolved sources which satisfy the\nselection criterion of having a half maximum intensity above\ntwice the rms distortion in the maps. We then compute the\ncorresponding flux of the kinetic effect by summing the same\nset of pixels in the kinetic maps. Figure 9 shows the resulting\nscatter plot, at frequency 143 GHz, made from all thirty of\n\nAs expected the largest kinetic distortions correspond\nto sources with stronger thermal fluxes. However, at this\nfrequency the typical flux of the kinetic effect is around one\norder of magnitude below the thermal, though for specific\nclusters the ratio can be as high as one third.\n\n5\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have used hydrodynamical simulations to study a number of aspects of the kinetic SZ effect, including its dependence on cosmological parameters. We have studied the redshift dependence, pixel histograms, angular power spectra,\nand the correlation between the kinetic and thermal effects.\nWe have confirmed that the kinetic effect has a dispersion\nmore than a factor five below the thermal (in the Rayleigh\u2013\nJeans region), leading to an angular power spectrum a factor\nof typically twenty-five lower in the low-density cosmologies.\nFor critical density we have found a smaller difference, but\nwith much greater statistical uncertainty. For the thermal\neffect the angular power spectrum is mostly generated at\nredshifts below one, while for the kinetic effect a significant\namount of the power has origin above redshift two. The correlation of the kinetic effect with the thermal confirms and\nquantifies the expected enhancement of the kinetic effect in\nregions with a strong thermal signal.\nOur simulations are of ideal size to study the SZ effect on scales between one and several arcminutes, which is\ncurrently a resolution attracting great interest. Our results\ncomplement perfectly the small-scale simulation work of Bruscoli et al. (1999) and Gnedin & Jaffe (2000), and recent\nsemi-analytic work including that of Benson et al. (2000)\nand Valageas et al. (2000). The theory of these secondary\nanisotropies is now becoming highly developed; the key challenges for the kinetic effect lie very much on the observational side.\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fThe kinetic Sunyaev\u2013Zel'dovich effect\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\n9\n\nWe are indebted to Hugh Couchman and Frazer Pearce for\ntheir part in writing the Hydra hydrodynamical N -body\ncode used to generate the simulation data used in this work.\nWe thank Jim Bartlett, Julian Borrill, Ian Grivell, Andrew\nJaffe, Scott Kay, Alexandre Refregier, Volker Springel, Aprajita Verma and Martin White for helpful discussions and\ncomments.
