representatives are derived, and a correspondence between\nthem and families of knots and links given in Conway notation is established.\n\n1. Introduction\nIn the present article Conway notation [1,2,3,4] will be used without any additional explanation. A braid-modified Conway notation is introduced in Section 1, for\na better understanding of the correspondence between braid family representatives\n(BF Rs) and families of knots and links (KLs) given in Conway notation.\nMinimum braids are defined, described, generated and presented in tables for\nknots up to ten crossings and oriented links up to nine crossings by T. Gittings\n[5]. T. Gittings used them for studying graph trees, amphicheirality, unknotting\nnumbers and periodic tables of KLs.\nSince knots are 1-component links, the term KL will be used for both knots and\nlinks.\nIn Section 2 we define a reduced braid word, describe general form for all reduced\nbraid words with s = 2 strands, generate all braid family representatives of twostrand braids, and establish a correspondence between them and families of KLs\ngiven in Conway notation. In Section 3 we consider the same problem for s \u2265 3. In\nSection 4 some applications of minimum braids [5] and braid family representatives\nare discussed. All computations are made using the knot-theory program LinKnot\nwritten by the authors [6], the extension of the program Knot2000 by M. Ochiai\nand N. Imafuji [7].\n2. Reduced Braid Words and Minimum Families of Braids with s = 2\nWe use the standard definition of a braid and description of minimum braids\ngiven by T. Gittings [5]. Instead of a . . . a, where a capital or lower case letter a\nappears p times, we write ap ; p is the degree of a (p \u2208 N ). It is also possible to\nwork with negative powers, satisfying the relationships: A\u2212p = ap , a\u2212p = Ap . A\n1\n\n\f2\n\nBraid Family Representatives\n\nnumber of strands is denoted by s, and a length of a braid word by l.\nThe operation a2 \u2192 a applied on any capital or lower case letter a is called\nidempotency. To every braid word we can apply the operation of idempotency until\na reduced braid word is obtained.\nDefinition 1. A reduced braid word is a braid word with degree of every capital or\nlower case letter equal to 1.\nBy an opposite procedure, braid word extension, from every reduced braid word\nwe obtain all braid words that can be derived from it by assigning a degree (that\ncan be greater then 1) to every letter. In this case, a reduced braid word plays a\nrole of a generating braid word.\nA braid word with one or more parameters denoting degrees greater then one\nrepresents a family of braid words. If values of all parameters are equal 2, it will be\ncalled a source braid.\nFor the minimality of reduced braids we are using the following criteria:\n1. minimum number of braid crossings;\n2. minimum number of braid strands;\n3. minimum binary code for alternating braid crossings.\nAccording to the first and second criterion minimal reduced braids are the shortest reduced braids with a smallest as possible number of different letters among all\nequivalent reduced braids representing certain KL. A binary code for any braid\ncrossing can be generated by assigning a zero for an alternating, and a one for\na non-alternating crossing. Hence, a priority will be given to alternating braids,\nand then to braids that differ from them as low as possible. Analogous minimality\ncriteria can be applied to source braids.\nDefinition 2. Among the set of all braid families representing the same KL family,\nthe braid family representative (M F B) is the one that has the following properties:\n1. minimum number of braid crossings;\n2. minimum reduced braid;\n3. minimum source braid.\nThese criteria are listed in descending order of importance for determining\nBF Rs.\nOur definition of BF Rs results in some fundamental differences with regard\nto minimum braids, defined by T. Gittings [5]. Some members of BF Rs will be\nminimum braids, but not necessarily.\nFor example, the minimum braid of the link .2 1 : 2 (9311 in Rolfsen [4]) is 9:03-05a\nAAbACbACb [5,Table 2]. According to the second BF R criterion it will be derived\n\n\fBraid Family Representatives\n\n3\n\nfrom the generating minimum braid AbAbACbC corresponding to the link .2 1 (8213 ),\nand not from the non-minimum generating braid AbACbACb corresponding to the\nsame link. Hence, to the three-component link .2 1 : 2 (9311 ) obtained as the first\nmember of BF R AbAp bACbC for p = 2 will correspond the braid AbAAbACbC,\nthat is not a minimum braid according to the minimum braid criteria [5].\nThe third criterion: minimum source braid enables us to obtain KLs of a certain\nfamily from a single BF R, and not from several different BF Rs. For example,\napplying this criterion, KLs .3.2.2 0, .2.3.2 0 and .2.2.3 0 belonging to the same KL\nfamily .r.p.q 0 will be obtained from the single BF R Ap bAq bAbr . Otherwise, using\nthe minimum braid criteria [5], the knot .3.2.2 0 will be obtained from the family\nAp bAbq Abr , three-component link .2.3.2 0 will be obtained from Ap bAq bAbr , and\nthe knot .2.2.3 0 will be obtained from Ap bAq br Ab for p = 3, q = 2, r = 2. Source\nbraids corresponding to the families Ap bAbq Abr , Ap bAq bAbr and Ap bAq br Ab are\nA2 bAb2 Ab2 , A2 bA2 bAb2 and A2 bA2 b2 Ab, respectively, and the second source braid\nis minimal. Hence, the representative of the KL family .r.p.q 0 is BF R Ap bAq bAbr .\nAccording to this, to every BF R can be associated a single corresponding family\nof KLs given in Conway notation and vice versa.\nAn overlapping of KL families obtained from BF Rs can occur only at their\nbeginnings. For example, distinct BF Rs AbAp bACbC and Ap bCbAbCb, giving KL\nfamilies .2 1 : p and .p 1 : 2, respectively, for p = 2 will have as a joint member\naforementioned three-component link .2 1 : 2 (9311 ). According to the second BF R\ncriterion, it will be derived from the minimum generating braid AbAbACbC, and\nnot from AbACbACb. Hence, BF R AbAp bACbC giving KLs of the form .2 1 : p\nbegins for p = 2, and Ap bCbAbCb giving KLs of the form for .p 1 : 2 begins for\np = 3. In this way, all ambiguous cases can be solved.\nEvery KL is algebraic (if its basic polyhedron is 1\u2217 ) or polyhedral, so according to this criterion, all KLs are divided into two main categories: algebraic and\npolyhedral. Since to every member of a BF R corresponds a single KL, we can\nintroduce the following definition:\nDefinition 3. An alternating BF R is polyhedral iff its corresponding KLs are polyhedral. Otherwise, it is algebraic. A non-alternating BF R is polyhedral iff its corresponding alternating BF R is polyhedral. Otherwise, it will be called algebraic.\nThe division of non-alternating BF Rs into algebraic and polyhedral does not coincide with the division of the corresponding KLs [1,2,3], because minimum number\nof braid crossings is used as the first criterion for the BF Rs. Accepting minimum\nreduced braid universe [5] as the first criterion, all KLs derived from the basic polyhedron .1 will be algebraic, because they can be represented by non-alternating\nminimal (but not minimum [5]) algebraic braids. E.g., the alternating knot .2.2 0\n(816 ) with the polyhedral braid A2 bA2 bAb can be represented as the algebraic knot\n(\u22123, 2) (3, \u22122) with the corresponding algebraic braid A3 b2 a2 B 3 . In this case, to\nthe knot 816 corresponds algebraic braid A3 b2 a2 B 3 that reduces to AbaB, and not\nA2 bA2 bAb that reduces to AbAbAb.\n\n\f4\n\nBraid Family Representatives\n\nAnother solution of this discrepancy is changing the definition of an algebraic\nKL into the following:\nDefinition 4. KL is algebraic if it has an algebraic minimum crossing number\nrepresentation.\nIn this case, all KLs derived from the basic polyhedron .1 (with Conway symbols\nbeginning with a dot) will be polyhedral KLs, because their minimum crossing\nnumber representations are polyhedral.\nWe will consider only BF Rs corresponding to prime KLs.\nIt is easy to conclude that every 1-strand BF R is of the form Ap , with the\ncorresponding KL family p in Conway notation.\nTheorem 1. Every reduced BF R with s = 2 is of the form (Ab)n , n \u2265 2.\nThis BF R corresponds to the knot 2 2 and to the family of basic polyhedra\n.1 = 6\u2217 , 8\u2217 , 10\u2217 , 12\u2217 (or 12A according to A. Caudron [3]), etc. For n \u2265 3 all of\nthem are n-antiprisms. Let us notice that the first member of this family, the knot\n2 2, is not an exception: it is an antiprism with two digonal bases.\nTheorem 2. All algebraic alternating KLs with s = 2 are the members of the\nfollowing families:\np 1 2 with the BF R Ap bAb (p \u2265 1);\np 1 1 q with the BF R Ap bAbq (p \u2265 q \u2265 2);\np, q, 2 with the BF R Ap bAq b (p \u2265 q \u2265 2);\np, q, r 1 with the BF R Ap bAq br (r \u2265 2, p \u2265 q \u2265 2);\n(p, r) (q, s) with the BF R Ap bq Ar bs\n(p, q, r, s \u2265 2, p \u2265 r, p \u2265 s, s \u2265 q and if p = s, then r \u2265 q).\nMinimum braids include one additional braid (Ap bq Abr ) in the case of algebraic\nalternating KLs with s = 2.\nAlternating polyhedral KLs with s = 2 are given in the following table, each\nwith its BF R. KLs in this table are given in \"standard\" Conway notation (that is\n\"standardized\" for knots with n \u2264 10 and links with n \u2264 9 crossings according to\nRolfsen's book [4]). This table can be extended to an infinite list of antiprismatic\nbasic polyhedra (2n)\u2217 described by the BF Rs (Ab)n , n \u2265 3 and BF Rs with s = 2\nobtained as their extensions.\nTable 1\nBasic polyhedron .1 = 6\u2217\nAp bAbAb\nAp bAbAbq\nAp bAq bAb\n\n.p\n.p.q\n.p.q 0\n\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n\nAp bAbAq br\nAp bAbq Ar bs\nAp bAq bAr bs\n\nr : p 0 : q 0 (7)\np.s.r.q\n(8)\nq 0.p.r 0.s 0 (9)\n\n\fBraid Family Representatives\n\nAp bAbq Ab .p : q 0\nAp bAq bAbr .r.p.q 0\nAp bAq bAr b p : q : r\n\n(4)\n(5)\n(6)\n\nAp bAq br Abs\nAp bAq br As bt\nAp bq Ar bs At bu\n\n.p.s.r 0.q 0\np.t.s.r.q\np.q.r.s.t.u\n\n5\n\n(10)\n(11)\n(12)\n\nIf we apply minimum braid criteria [5], we need to add ten braids for the basic polyhedron .1 = 6\u2217 : (1') Ap bAbq Abr , (2') Ap bAq br Ab, (3') Ap bq AbAbr , (4')\nAp bAq br As b, (5') Ap bq AbAr bs , (6') Ap bq Abr Abs , (7') Ap bq Ar bAbs , (8') Ap bq Abr As bt ,\n(9') Ap bq Ar bAs bt , (10') Ap bq Ar bs Abt . Applying BF R criteria, according to the\nminimum source braid criterion all KLs obtained from the braids (1') and (2') will\nbe obtained from BF R (5), KLs obtained from (3') will be obtained from (7), KLs\nobtained from (4') and (6') will be obtained from (9), KLs obtained from (5') and\n(7') will be obtained from (8), and KLs obtained from (8'), (9') and (10') will be\nobtained from (11). Using minimum braid criteria [5], we need to make analogous\nadditions to all classes of BF Rs considered in this paper.\nFor the basic polyhedron 8\u2217 we have:\nBasic polyhedron 8\u2217\nAp bAbAbAb\nAp bAbAbAbq\nAp bAq bAbAb\nAp bAbAbq Ab\nAp bAbAq bAb\nAp bAq bAbAbr\nAp bAbAq bAbr\nAp bAq bAr bAb\nAp bAq bAbr Ab\nAp bAbAbAq br\nAp bAbAbq Ar bs\nAp bAq bAbAr bs\nAp bAbq Ar bs Ab\nAp bAq br AbAbs\nAp bAq bAr bAbs\n\n8\u2217 p\n8\u2217 p.q\n8\u2217 p : q\n8\u2217 p : .q\n8\u2217 p :: q\n8\u2217 p.r :: .q\n8\u2217 p.r : .q\n8\u2217 p : q : r\n8\u2217 p : .r : .q\n8\u2217 p.r.q\n8\u2217 p.s.r.q\n8\u2217 p.s.r :: q\n8\u2217 p : .s.r.q\n8\u2217 p.s :: r.q\n8\u2217 p.s : .r : q\n\nAp bAq bAbr Abs\nAp bAbq Ar bAbs\nAp bAq bAr bAs b\nAp bAbAq br As bt\nAp bAq bAbr As bt\nAp bAq br As bAbt\nAp bAq bAr bAs bt\nAp bAq bAr bs Abt\nAp bAbq Ar bs At bu\nAp bAq bAr bs At bu\nAp bAq br As bAt bu\nAp bAq br As bt Abu\nAp bAq br As bt Au bv\nAp bq Ar bs At bu Av bw\n\n8\u2217 p : q : .r : s\n8\u2217 p.s : .r.q\n8\u2217 p : s : r : q\n8\u2217 p.t.s.r.q\n8\u2217 p.t.s.r : .q\n8\u2217 p : q.r.s : .t\n8\u2217 p.t.s : r : q\n8\u2217 p.t : s.r : q\n8\u2217 p.u.t.s.r.q\n8\u2217 p.u.t.s.r : q\n8\u2217 p.u.t : s.r.q\n8\u2217 p : q.r.s.t : u\n8\u2217 p.v.u.t.s.r.q\n8\u2217 p.q.r.s.t.u.v.w\n\nTrying to better understand the correspondence between BF Rs and Conway\nsymbols of KLs, we can introduce modified Conway notation. Most of KLs can\nbe given in Conway notation by several different symbols (and this is the main\ndisadvantage of Conway notation). In a similar way as with the classical notation,\nwhere every KL is given by its place in knot tables, we need to use some \"standard\"\ncode, according to the notation introduced in the original Conway's paper [2] and\nin the papers or books following it [1,3,4]. For example, the same polyhedral knot\n.p can be given by ..p, : p, : .p, . . ., or even as 6\u2217 p, 6\u2217 .p, 6\u2217 : .p, . . .\n\n\f6\n\nBraid Family Representatives\n\nWorking with BF Rs we introduce a braid-modified Conway notation that will be\nmore suitable for denoting KLs obtained from BF Rs. We are trying to have a same\ndegree p at the first position of a braid, and as the first element of Conway symbol\ncorresponding to it. Whenever possible, the order of degrees will be preserved in\nthe corresponding Conway symbol. By using this notation, we can recognize a\nvery simple pattern for BF Rs derived from the generating minimum braids of the\nform (Ab)n : by denoting in a Conway symbol corresponding to a given braid every\nsequence of single letters of a length k by k + 1 dots, we obtain the Conway symbol\nof a given braid. In order to recognize this pattern for KLs derived from basic\npolyhedra, first we need to use only one basic polyhedron 6\u2217 with n = 6 crossings,\nand not two of them (.1 and 6\u2217 ). In this case, the Table 1 will look as follows:\nBasic polyhedron 6\u2217\nAp bAbAb\nAp bAbAbq\nAp bAq bAb\nAp bAbq Ab\nAp bAq bAbr\nAp bAq bAr b\n\n6\u2217 p\n6\u2217 p :: .q\n6\u2217 p : q\n6\u2217 p : .q\n6\u2217 p : q : .r\n6\u2217 p : q : r\n\nAp bAbAq br\nAp bAbq Ar bs\nAp bAq bAr bs\nAp bAq br Abs\nAp bAq br As bt\nAp bq Ar bs At bu\n\n6\u2217 p :: q.r\n6\u2217 p : .q.r.s\n6\u2217 p : q : r.s\n6\u2217 p : q.r : s\n6\u2217 p : q.r.s.t\n6\u2217 p.q.r.s.t.u\n\nand for the basic polyhedron 8\u2217 we have:\nBasic polyhedron 8\u2217\nAp bAbAbAb\nAp bAbAbAbq\nAp bAq bAbAb\nAp bAbAbq Ab\nAp bAbAq bAb\nAp bAq bAbAbr\nAp bAbAq bAbr\nAp bAq bAr bAb\nAp bAq bAbr Ab\nAp bAbAbAq br\nAp bAbAbq Ar bs\nAp bAq bAbAr bs\nAp bAbq Ar bs Ab\nAp bAq br AbAbs\nAp bAq bAr bAbs\n\n8\u2217 p\n8\u2217 p ::: .q\n8\u2217 p : q\n8\u2217 p :: .q\n8\u2217 p :: q\n8\u2217 p : q :: .r\n8\u2217 p :: q : .r\n8\u2217 p : q : r\n8\u2217 p : q : .r\n8\u2217 p ::: q.r\n8\u2217 p :: .q.r.s\n8\u2217 p : q :: r.s\n8\u2217 p : .q.r.s\n8\u2217 p : q.r :: s\n8\u2217 p : q : r : .s\n\nAp bAq bAbr Abs\nAp bAbq Ar bAbs\nAp bAq bAr bAs b\nAp bAbAq br As bt\nAp bAq bAbr As bt\nAp bAq br As bAbt\nAp bAq bAr bAs bt\nAp bAq bAr bs Abt\nAp bAbq Ar bs At bu\nAp bAq bAr bs At bu\nAp bAq br As bAt bu\nAp bAq br As bt Abu\nAp bAq br As bt Au bv\nAp bq Ar bs At bu Av bw\n\n8\u2217 p : q : .r : s\n8\u2217 p : .q.r : .s\n8\u2217 p : q : r : s\n8\u2217 p :: q.r.s.t\n8\u2217 p : q : .r.s.t\n8\u2217 p : q.r.s : .t\n8\u2217 p : q : r : s.t\n8\u2217 p : q : r.s : t\n8\u2217 p : .q.r.s.t.u\n8\u2217 p : q : r.s.t.u\n8\u2217 p : q.r.s : t.u\n8\u2217 p : q.r.s.t : u\n8\u2217 p : q.r.s.t.u.v\n8\u2217 p.q.r.s.t.u.v.w\n\nUnfortunately, it is not possible to express every family of KLs in the braidmodified Conway notation. Another problem is that it strongly differs from the\nstandard Conway notation. Therefore, the braid-modified Conway notation is used\n\n\fBraid Family Representatives\n\n7\n\nonly when after some slight modification standard Conway symbols remained completely understandable to a reader familiar with them.\nIn the same way, it is possible to continue with the derivation of BF Rs from\nbasic polyhedra with a higher number of crossings.\nHence, we conclude that:\nCorollary All alternating KLs with s = 2 are described by Theorem 2 and by\nan infinite extension of Table 1.\nFrom alternating BF Rs we obtain non-alternating BF Rs by crossing changes.\nThis way, from BF Rs derived from the generating minimum braid (Ab)2 we obtain\nthe following families of non-alternating BF Rs and corresponding new KL families:\nAp BaB\nAp baq b\nAp BAq B\nAp BaB q\nAp B q aB r\n\n(p \u2212 1) 3\np, (q \u2212 1) 1, \u22122\np, q, \u22122\n(p \u2212 1) 2 q\np \u2212 1, q, r+\n\nAp baq br\nAp BAq B r\nAp B q ar B s\nAp B q Ar B s\n\np, (q \u2212 1) 1, \u2212(r + 1)\np, q, \u2212r 1\n(\u2212p, r) (q, s)\n(p, r) \u2212 (q, s)\n\nIn the same way, we can derive non-alternating BF Rs with s = 2 from the\ngenerating BF R (Ab)n , n \u2265 3.\n3. Braid Family Representatives with s \u2265 3\nIn order to continue derivation of BF Rs and corresponding KLs for s \u2265 3 first\nwe derive all different reduced minimum braid words. It is possible to establish\ngeneral construction rules for generating minimum braid words.\nDefinition 5. For a given generating minimum braid word W = wL that ends\nwith a capital or lower case letter L, a replacement of L by a word w1 in W will be\ncalled extending by replacement. An addition of the word w1 to W is extending by\naddition. The both operations are extending operations.\nDefinition 6. Let W = wLs and w1 = Ls+1 Ls Ls+1 be generating minimum braids\nwith s and s+1 strings, where Ls denotes sth letter and Ls+1 denotes (s+1)th letter.\nThe word extending operations obtained this way will be called, respectively, (s+1)extending by replacement, and (s + 1)-extending by addition. The both operations\nare (s + 1)-extending operations.\nFor example, the first operation applied on AbAb gives AbACbC, and the other\nAbAbCbC.\nThe (s + 1)-extending by replacement is sufficient for construction of generating\nminimum braids for a given s, with l = 2s, corresponding to KLs of the form\n2 . . . 2 = 2s , where 2 occurs s times. For 2 \u2264 s \u2264 6 as the result we obtain: AbAb,\nAbACbC, AbACbdCd, AbACbdCEdE, AbACbdCEdf Ef . . .\nThe generating minimum braids for given s, with l = 3s \u2212 2, corresponding to\nKLs of the form 2 1 . . . 1 2 = 2 13s\u22126 2, where 1 occurs 3s\u2212 6 times, can be obtained\n\n\f8\n\nBraid Family Representatives\n\nusing only (s + 1)-extension by addition. For 3 \u2264 s \u2264 6 we obtain: AbAbCbC,\nAbAbCbCdCd, AbAbCbCdCdEdE, AbAbCbCdCdEdEf Ef . . .\nApplying the same procedure, from A3 we obtain the series A3 BaB, A3 BaBCbC,\n3\nA BaBCbCDcD, A3 BaBCbCDcDEdE . . ., corresponding to the knots 3 2, 5 2, 7 2,\n92 ...\nAnalogously, starting with w1 = AbAbCbdCd and using the (s + 1)-extension\nby replacement, the generating minimum braids with l = 2s + 1, corresponding to\nKLs of the form 2 2 1 . . . 1 2 = 22 12s\u22125 2 are obtained for given s.\nHowever, in order to exhaust all possibilities, all combinations of (s+1)-extending\noperations are used for derivation of reduced minimum braids.\nTheorem 3. Every generating algebraic minimum braid can be derived from AbAb\nby a recursive application of (s + 1)-extending operations.\nThe minimal generating braid words for s \u2264 5 with their corresponding KLs\nare given in the following table:\ns=1\n\nl=1\n\nA\n\n1\n\ns=2\n\nl=4\n\nAbAb\n\n22\n\ns=3\ns=3\n\nl=6\nl=7\n\nAbACbC\nAbAbCbC\n\n222\n21112\n\ns=4\ns=4\ns=4\n\nl = 8 AbACbdCd\nl = 9 AbAbCbdCd\nl = 10 AbAbCbCdCd\n\n2222\n221112\n21111112\n\ns=5\ns=5\ns=5\ns=5\ns=5\ns=5\n\nl = 10\nl = 11\nl = 11\nl = 12\nl = 12\nl = 13\n\n22222\n2221112\n2211122\n221111112\n211121112\n21111111112\n\nAbACbdCEdE\nAbAbCbdCdEdE\nAbACbCdCEdE\nAbAbCbCdCEdE\nAbAbCbdCdEdE\nAbAbCbCdCdEcE\n\nIn the case of polyhedral generating minimum braid words it is also possible to\nmake generalizations. We have already considered the infinite class of generating\npolyhedral minimum braid words (Ab)n with s = 2. The first infinite class with\ns = 3 will be (Ab)n\u22121 ACbC, with the corresponding KLs of the form (2n)\u2217 2 1 0.\nEvery BF R can be derived from a generating minimum braid by assigning a\ndegree (that can be greater then 1) to every letter.\nFor s = 3 there are two generating alternating algebraic minimum braid words:\nAbACbC, l = 6, with the corresponding link 2 2 2;\nAbAbCbC, l = 7, with the corresponding knot 2 1 1 1 2,\nthat generate prime KLs.\n\n\fBraid Family Representatives\n\n9\n\nFrom AbACbC we derived 17 alternating BF Rs and their corresponding families\nof KLs, given in the following table:\nAp bACbC\nAbACbp C\nAp bACbq C\nAp bAq CbC\nAp bACbC q\nAbp ACbq C\nAp bq ACbr C\nAp bACbq C r\nAp bAq CbC r\n\nAp bAq Cbr C\nAp bq Ar Cbs C\nAp bq ACbr C s\nAp bAq Cbr C s\nAp bAq C r bC s\nAp bq Ar Cbs C t\nAp bAq C r bs C t\nAp bq Ar C s bt C u\n\np122\np, 2, 2+\np 1, q, 2+\np, q, 2 2\np121q\np, 2, q, 2\np 1, q, r, 2\np 1, q, r 1+\np, q, r 1 2\n\n(p, q) (r, 2+)\n(p, r) (q, 2, s)\np 1, q, s 1, r\n(p, q) (r, s 1+)\n(p, q) 2 (r, s)\n(p, r) (q, t 1, s)\n(p, q), s, (t, r)+\n(p, r), q, (u, s), t\n\nThe next generating alternating algebraic minimum braid AbAbCbC of the\nlength 7, with s = 3, gives the following results:\nAp bAbCbC\nAbAbCbp C\nAbAbp CbC\nAp bq AbCbC\nAp bAq bCbC\nAp bAbq CbC\nAp bAbCbC q\nAbAbp Cbq C\nAbp AbCbq C\nAp bq Ar bCbC\nAp bq Abr CbC\nAp bq AbCbr C\nAp bAq bCbr C\nAp bAq br CbC\nAp bAq bCbC r\nAp bAbq Cbr C\nAp bAbq CbC r\nAp bAbCbq C r\nAbp Abq Cbr C\nAp bq Ar bs CbC\n\nAp bq AbCbr C s\nAp bAq br Cbs C\nAp bAq br CbC s\nAp bAq bC r bC s\nAp bAq bCbr C s\nAp bAbq Cbr C s\nAp bAbC q br C s\nAp bq Ar bCbs C\nAp bq Abr Cbs C\nAp bq Ar bCbs C t\nAp bq Abr Cbs C t\nAp bAq br C s bC t\nAp bAq br Cbs C t\nAp bAq bC r bs C t\nAp bAbq C r bs C t\nAp bq Ar bs Cbt C\nAp bq Ar bs Cbt C u\nAp bq Ar bC s bt C u\nAp bAq br C s bt C u\nAp bq Ar bs C t bu C v\n\np11112\np, 2 1 1, 2\n21p12\np 1, q, 2 1 1\np, q, 2 1 1 1\np11q12\np11111q\n2 1 p, q, 2\n(p, 2) 1 (q, 2)\n(p, r) (q, 2 1 1)\np 1, q, 2 1 r\n(p 1, q) 1 (r, 2)\n(p, q) 1 1 (2, r)\np, q, 2 1 r 1\np, q, r 1 1 1 1\np 1 1 q, r, 2\np11q11r\np 1 1 1, q, r 1\n(p, 2) q (r, 2)\n(p, r) (q, 2 1 s)\n\n(p 1, q) 1 (s 1, r)\n(p, q) 1 r (2, s)\np, q, s 1 1 r 1\n(p, q) 1 1 1 (r, s)\n(p, q) 1 1 (r, s 1)\np 1 1 q, r, s 1\n(p 1 1 1, r) (q, s)\n(p, r), q, (2, s) 1\n(p 1, q) r (2, s)\n(p, r), q, (t 1, s) 1\n(p 1, q) r (t 1, s)\n(p, q) 1 r 1 (s, t)\n(p, q) 1 r (s, t 1)\n(p, q) 1 1, (t, r), s\n(p 1 1 q, s) (r, t)\n(p, r), q, (t, 2) s\n((p, r), q) s (u 1, t)\n((p, r), q) 1 ((u, s), t)\n(p, q) 1 r ((u, s), t)\n((p, r), q) s ((u, t), v)\n\nExcept AbACbC and AbAbCbC, all generating minimum braids with s = 3 are\npolyhedral.\nFor s = 3 and l \u2264 12, the polyhedral generating braids and their corresponding\nKLs are given in the following table, with the notation for basic polyhedra with 12\ncrossings according to A.

Applications of Minimum Braids and BF Rs\n4.1. Graph Trees\nA rational KL in Conway notation is any sequence of natural numbers not\nbeginning or ending with 1, where each sequence is identified with its inverse. From\nthis definition is computed the number of rational KLs with n crossings. It is given\nby the formula\n2n\u22124 + 2[n/2]\u22122\nthat holds for every n \u2265 4. This very simple formula is derived first by C. Ernst\nand D.W. Sumners in another form [8], and later independently by S. Jablan [9,10].\nFor n \u2265 4 we can compute the first 20 numbers of this sequence. After prepending to it the first three numbers 1 for n = 1, 2, 3, the result is the sequence: 1,\n1, 1, 2, 3, 6, 10, 20, 36, 72, 136, 272, 528, 1056, 1080, 4160, 8256, 16512, 32986,\n65792, 131328, 262656, 524800, . . . This sequence is included in On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (http://www.research.att.com/\u223cnjas/sequences/) as the\nsequence A005418. The number of rational knots with n crossings (n \u2265 3) is given\nby the formula\n(n\u22121)\n\n2n\u22123 + 2[ 2 ]\u22122\nn\n\n(mod 2)\n\n+ (\u22121)(n\u22121)[ 2 ]\nn\n\n(mod 2)\n\n3\nso we can simply derive the formula for the number of rational links with n crossings\nas well.\nA graph-theoretical approach to knot theory is proposed by A. Caudron [3].\nT. Gittings established a mapping between minimum braids with s strands and\n\n\fBraid Family Representatives\n\n13\n\ntrees with s+1 vertices and conjectured that the number of graph trees of n vertices\nwith alternating minimum braids is equal to the number of rational KLs with n\ncrossings [5, Conjecture 1].\n4.2. Amphicheiral KLs\nKL is achiral (or amphicheiral) if its \"left\" and \"right\" forms are equivalent,\nmeaning that one can be transformed to the other by an ambient isotopy. If an\noriented knot or link L can be represented by an antisymmetrical vertex-bicolored\ngraph on a sphere, whose vertices with the sign +1 are white, and vertices with the\nsign \u22121 are black, it is achiral. In this case, for an oriented knot or link L there\nexists an antisymmetry (sign-changing symmetry) switching orientations of vertices,\ni.e., mutually exchanging vertices with the signs +1 and \u22121 [9,10]. In the language\nof braid words, this means that its corresponding braid word is antisymmetric (or\npalindromic): there exist a mirror antisymmetry transforming one letter to another\nand vice versa and changing their case (i.e., transforming capital to lower case letters\nand vice versa). For example, the reduced braid words Ab |Ab or ABac |BDcd are\npalindromic, where the anti-mirror is denoted by |. Hence, we believe that the origin\nof all oriented achiral KLs are palindromic reduced braids.\nConjecture An oriented KL is achiral iff it can be obtained from a palindromic\nreduced braid by a symmetric assigning of degrees.\nFor s = 2 all alternating BF Rs are of the form (Ab)n (n \u2265 2), defining a series of\nthe basic polyhedra (2n)\u2217 , beginning with 2 2, .1 = 6\u2217 , 8\u2217 , 10\u2217 , 12\u2217 , etc. All of them\nare achiral KLs, representing a source of other achiral KLs. From 4:1-01 AbAb (2 2\nor 41 ) by a symmetric assigning of degrees we can derive achiral alternating knots\nwith n \u2264 10 crossings: 6:1-02 A2 bAb2 (2 1 1 2 or 63 ), 8:1-05 A3 bAb3 (3 1 1 3 or 89 ),\n10:1-017 A3 b2 A2 b3 ((3, 2) (3, 2) or 1079 ), and one achiral alternating link with n \u2264 9\ncrossings: 8:3-05a A2 b2 A2 b2 ((2, 2) (2, 2) or 834 ), etc. In general, from AbAb the\nfollowing families of achiral alternating KLs are derived:\nAp bAbp\n\nAp bq Aq bp\n\np11p\n\n(p, q) (p, q)\n\nBorromean rings 6:3-02 AbAbAb (.1 = 6\u2217 or 632 ) are the origin of achiral alternating knots 8:1-07 A2 bAbAb2 (.2.2 or 817 ), 10:1-020 A2 bA2 b2 Ab2 (.2.2.2 0.2 0 or 1099 ),\n10:1-022 A2 b2 AbA2 b2 (2.2.2.2 or 10109 ), and of the link 8:3-04a Ab2 AbA2 b (.2 : 2 0\nor 836 ), etc. In general, from AbAbAb the following families of achiral alternating\nKLs are derived:\nAp bAbAbp\nAbp AbAp b\nAp bq AbAq bp\n\n.p.p\n.p : p 0\np.q.q.p\n\nAp bAq bq Abp\nAp bq Ar br Aq bp\n\n.p.p.q 0.q 0\np.q.r.r.q.p\n\nAchiral basic polyhedron AbAbAbAb (8\u2217 ) is the origin of the following families\nof alternating achiral KLs:\nAp bAbAbAbp\n\n8\u2217 p.p\n\nAp bAbq Aq bAbp\n\n8\u2217 p.q : .q.p\n\n\f14\n\nBraid Family Representatives\n\nAbAp bAbp Ab\nAp bq AbAbAq bp\nAp bAq bAbq Abp\n\n8\u2217 p : .p\n8\u2217 p.q.q.p\n8\u2217 .p : q.q : p\n\nAp bq Ar bAbr Aq bp\nAp bAq br Ar bq Abp\n\n8\u2217 p.q.r.r.q.p\n8\u2217 p.q.q.p : r.r\n\nIn the same way it is possible to derive achiral alternating KLs from all achiral\nbasic polyhedra (Ab)n for n \u2265 5.\nFrom the antisymmetry condition it follows that every palindromic braid has\nan even number of strands. For s = 4 and l \u2264 12 palindromic algebraic generating\nbraids are:\nAbACbdCd, l = 8 with the corresponding achiral link 2 2 2 2,\nAbAbCbCdCd, l = 10, with the corresponding achiral knot 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 2.\nThe palindromic polyhedral generating braids are:\nAbACbCbdCd, l = 10, with the corresponding achiral knot .2 1.2 1,\nAbAbACbdCdCd, l = 12, with the corresponding achiral link 12J,\nAbACbAdCbdCd, l = 12, with the corresponding achiral knot 12L,\nAbACbCbCbdCd, l = 12, with the corresponding achiral link 8\u2217 2 1 0.2 1 0,\nAbCbAbCdCbCd, l = 12, with the corresponding achiral knot 10\u2217\u2217 : 20 :: .2 0,\nAbCbACbdCbCd, l = 12, with the corresponding achiral knot 10\u2217\u2217 2 0 :: .2 0.\nFrom the generating braid AbACbdCd following families of alternating achiral\nKLs are derived:\nAp bACbdCdp\nAbAC p bp dCd\nAbp AC q bq dC p d\n\np1221p\n(p, 2+) (p, 2+)\n(p, q, 2) (p, q, 2)\n\nAp bAq C r br dq Cdp\nAp bq AC r br dC q dp\nAp bq Ar C s bs dr C q dp\n\n(((p, q), r)+) (((p, q), r)+)\n(q, p 1, r) (q, p 1, r)\n(q, (p, r), s) (q, (p, r), s)\n\nFrom the same palindromic non-alternating generating braid the following families of achiral KLs are obtained:\nAp BacBDcdp\nAbAcp B p dCd\n\npp\n(p, 2) (q, 2)\n\nAp BacBDcdp\nAp bAcq B q dCdp\n\n2pp2\n(p 1, q) (p 1, q)\n\nIn the same way is possible to continue the derivation of achiral KLs from other\npalindromic reduced braids.\nThe family of achiral odd crossing number knots discovered by J. Hoste, M. Thistlethwaite and J. Weeks in 1998 [11] can be extended to the two-parameter BF R defined\nby the palindromic braid ABaB q C p BAdcbp cq Dcd corresponding to the family of\nnon-alternating achiral odd-crossing knots with n = 7 + 4p + 4q crossings\n10\u2217\u2217 (\u22122p) 0. \u2212 1. \u2212 2 0.(2q) : (\u22122p) 0. \u2212 1. \u2212 2 0.(2q)\n.\n4.3. Unlinking Numbers and Unlinking Gap\nT. Gittings [5] noticed that it might be possible to calculate unlinking numbers\nfrom minimum braids. Unfortunately, this is true only for KLs with n \u2264 10 crossings, including the link 4 1 4 (924 ) and the Nakanishi-Bleiler example 5 1 4 (108 ) with\nan unlinking gap [12].\n\n\fBraid Family Representatives\n\n15\n\nDefinition 7. The minimum braid unlinking gap is the positive difference between\nthe unlinking number obtained from a minimum braid uB (L) and unlinking number\nu(L) of a link L, i.e.,\n\u03b4B = uB (L) \u2212 u(L) > 0.\nThe unlinking gap [12] for minimum braids appears for n = 11. The following\nalternating links given in Conway notation, followed by their minimum braids have\nthe minimum braid unlinking gap:\n.5.2\n.3.4\n8\u2217 4\n.2.3.3 0\n\nA5 bAbAb2\nA4 bAbAb3\nA4 bAbAbAb\nA3 bA3 bAb2\n\n8\u2217 3.2\n8\u2217 3 : 2\n8\u2217 2.2 : .2\n10\u2217 2\n\nA3 bAbAbAb2\nA3 bA2 bAbAb\nA2 bAbA2 bAb2\nA2 bAbAbAbAb\n\nFor the links .5.2, .3.4 the value of minimum braid unlinking gap is \u03b4B = 2, and\nfor other links from this list \u03b4B = 1. Hence, minimum braid unlinking number is\ndifferent from the unlinking number and represents a new KL invariant.\n4.4. Periodic Tables of KLs\nPeriodic tables of KLs can be established in three ways: starting with families of KLs given in Conway notation [9,10,13], with minimum braids [5], or with\nBF Rs. Since we have established correspondence between BF Rs and KLs in Conway notation, it follows that the same patterns (with regard to all KL polynomial\ninvariants and KL properties) will appear in all cases. For example, for every family of KLs is possible to obtain a general formula for Alexander polynomials, with\ncoefficients expressed by numbers denoting tangles in Conway symbols, or from\ntheir corresponding parameters from minimum braids or from BF Rs. The same\nholds not only for KL polynomials, but for all other properties of KLs: writhe,\namphicheirality, number of projections, unlinking number, signature, periods, etc.\n[9,10,13].\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to express our gratitude to Thomas Gittings for his critical reading\nof the manuscript, corrections, advice and suggestions.\nReferences\n[1] C.
