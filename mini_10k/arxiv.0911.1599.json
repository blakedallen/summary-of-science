Thus, \u03bb-temperature is\ndetermined only by the three physical parameters, \u03c10 , m\nand \u03c3. Among these parameters, the hard sphere diameter \u03c3 is especially important, because it is a crucial\nparameter for hard-core repulsive interactions at short\ndistances. Using eq. (1), one can obtain the theoretical\nvalue of T\u03bb , because the experimental values of \u03c10 , m\nand \u03c3 are known. Eq. (1) gives T\u03bb = 2.194 K [1], which\nis very close to the experimental value of 2.1768 K [2].\nThe deviation between the theoretical and experimental\nvalues is less than 1%. In this meaning, our approach\nsucceeded. However, in the previous paper [1], we did\nnot study the elementary excitations.\nAlthough the roton, which is an elementary excitation\nwith finite energy gap \u2206, has been extensively studied\nin the past, its physical nature still remains unclear [3].\nIn this paper, we calculate the roton energy gap at zero\ntemperature \u2206(0) to understand the physical nature of\nroton. First, we calculate the roton energy gap using the\neffective potential of the mean field effective field theory.\nSecond, we introduce the curvature matrix which allows\nus to calculate the energy gap directly. The relation that\nwe have derived is very simple, \u2206(0)/kB T\u03bb = 4. This\nrelation gives \u2206(0)/kB = 8.707 K, which is very close to\nthe experimental value of 8.712 K. Finally, we comment\non an open problem about the sound speed of phonon. In\nthe next section, we begin with a brief review of ref. [1]\nfor self-consistency of this paper.\n\n\u2217 E-mail:harada@sci.niihama-nct.ac.jp\n\nSPONTANEOUS SYMMETRY BREAKING\nAND \u03bb-TEMPERATURE\n\nThe superfluid phase of liquid helium-4 is described by\nthe Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) effective field theory, in which\nthe cooperative state of many interacting helium atoms\nis represented with a single complex scalar field \u03c6. GP\ntheory is defined by\nL = i~\u03c6\u2217\n\n\u2202\n~2 \u2217 2\n\u03bb\n2\n\u03c6+\n\u03c6 \u2207 \u03c6 + \u03bc\u03c6\u2217 \u03c6 \u2212 (\u03c6\u2217 \u03c6) , (2)\n\u2202t\n2m\n2\n\nwhere \u03c6 is a one-component complex scalar field with\nboth amplitude and phase, m is the mass of a helium\natom, \u03bc is the chemical potential, \u03bb = 2\u03c0~2 \u03c3/m is the\ncoupling constant for hard-core repulsive interactions at\nshort distances and \u03c3 is the hard sphere diameter of a\nhelium atom, respectively. Thus, GP theory is a nonrelativistic version of the Goldstone model in particle\nphysics. GP Lagrangian (2) is invariant under the global\nU (1) transformations; \u03c6 \u2192 ei\u03b8 \u03c6, \u03c6\u2217 \u2192 e\u2212i\u03b8 \u03c6\u2217 with\n\u2202\u03b8/\u2202t = \u2207\u03b8 = 0. Because U (1) symmetry is not gauged,\nno vector gauge field appears.\nIn the GP theory, the \u03bb-transition is described as the\nspontaneous symmetry breaking of the U (1) symmetry.\nOne can understand this statement as follows. The effective potential V at the tree-level approximation is given\nby the third and the fourth terms in eq. (2), which does\nnot contain the derivatives;\nV = \u2212\u03bc\u03c6\u2217 \u03c6 +\n\n\u03bb \u2217 2\n(\u03c6 \u03c6) .\n2\n\n(3)\n\nAs shown in ref. [1], the \u03bb-temperature T\u03bb is determined\nonly by this potential. Here it should be noted that\nthe chemical potential \u03bc becomes positive below the \u03bbtemperature [1], and then the ground states become degenerate for T < T\u03bb . Fig. 1 shows the schematic temperature dependence of the effective potential V .\nLet's consider the ground state of this system below\nthe \u03bb-temperature. In general, the ground state is given\nby solving the condition\n\u2202V\n= \u2212\u03bc\u03c6\u2217 + \u03bb(\u03c6\u2217 \u03c6)\u03c6 = 0.\n\u2202\u03c6\n\n(4)\n\n\f2\nV/n0\n\nV\n\nT=0\nT>T\u03bb\n\n\uf8e7\uf8e7\n\n0\n\n0\nT<T\u03bb\n\nRe\u03c6\n\nRe\u03c6\n\nkBT\u03bb\n\nT=0\n\n-\u03bc0/2\n\nFIG. 1: The schematic temperature dependence of the effective potential V . \u03c6 = 0 is not stable for T < T\u03bb .\n\nThis condition yields two solutions,\nr\n\u03bc\n.\n\u03c6 = 0, |\u03c6| =\n\u03bb\n\n(5)\n\nAs shown in Fig. 1, the trivial solution \u03c6 =\np0 is not stable\nfor T < T\u03bb , but another solution |\u03c6| = \u03bc/\u03bb is stable.\nFurthermore, because |\u03c6|2 is equal to the number density\nn of superfluid, the following relation is satisfied below\nthe \u03bb-temperature,\nr\nr\n\u03bc \u221a\n\u03c1s\n|\u03c6| =\n= n\u2261\n,\n(6)\n\u03bb\nm\nwhere \u03c1s is the superfluid density and m is the mass of\na helium atom. From eq. (6), the chemical potential at\nzero temperature \u03bc(0) is given by\n\u03bc(0) =\n\n\u03bb\u03c10\n\u03bb\u03c1s (0)\n=\n,\nm\nm\n\np\n\u03bc(0)n0\n\u03bc(0)/\u03bb) =\n,\n2\n\nFIG. 2: The potential per number density at zero temperature. The depth represents the \u03bb-temperature.\n\nthe global U (1) symmetry. Because the scalar field \u03c6 has\ntwo degrees of freedom (its amplitude and phase), the\n\u03bb-temperature is given by\nV0 /n0 =\n\n(8)\n\nwhere n0 \u2261 \u03c10 /m is the number density of liquid helium4 at zero temperature. The depth of the effective potential represents the required energy density to recover\n\n1\nkB T\u03bb \u00d7 2.\n2\n\n(9)\n\nFig. 2 shows this situation. From eqs. (7), (8), (9) and\n\u03bb = 2\u03c0~2 \u03c3/m, we obtain the following formula for the\n\u03bb-temperature,\nT\u03bb =\n\n\u03c10 \u03c0~2 \u03c3\n.\nm2 kB\n\n(10)\n\nUsing eq. (10), one can calculate the \u03bb-temperature,\nbecause the experimental values of \u03c10 , m and \u03c3 are\nknown. Substituting the following values into eq. (10),\n\u03c10 = 0.1451 g/cm3 ,\nm = 6.6465 \u00d7 10\u221224 g,\n\u03c3 = 2.639 \u00c5,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere \u03c10 is the total density of liquid helium-4 at zero\ntemperature, and we have used the relation \u03c1s (0) = \u03c10 .\nBefore deriving the formula for T\u03bb , we should see the\nspontaneous symmetry breaking. For T > T\u03bb , the effective potential has only one minimum at \u03c6 = 0, and then\nthe global U (1) symmetry is not broken. For T < T\u03bb ,\nthe field \u03c6 rolls down from \"hill-top\" at \u03c6 = 0 to the\nbottom, and then the global U (1) symmetry is spontaneously broken. This phenomenon is the \u03bb-transition.\nThe derivation of the formula for T\u03bb is very easy as follows. When T = 0, the scalar field \u03c6 is located at\npthe bottom, and then it takes the nonzero value |\u03c6| = \u03bc(0)/\u03bb.\nHence the global U (1) symmetry is spontaneously broken\nin this phase. As the temperature increases above the \u03bbtemperature, the scalar field \u03c6 is located at \u03c6 = 0, and\nthe global U (1) symmetry is recovered. Therefore, it is\nenough that we consider how energy is necessary to take\nthe scalar field \u03c6 from the bottom to \"hill-top\". From\neq. (3), the depth of the potential V0 is given by\nV0 \u2261 \u2212V (|\u03c6| =\n\n\u221a\u03bc0/\u03bb\n\n(11)\n(12)\n(13)\n\none obtains the theoretical value\nT\u03bb = 2.194 K.\n\n(14)\n\nThis is very close to the experimental values of 2.1768 K,\nand the deviation between the theoretical and experimental values is less than 1 %. Thus, spontaneous symmetry\nbreaking is a key concept to understand the \u03bb-transition.\nIII.\n\nROTON ENERGY GAP\n\nIn this section, we calculate the roton energy gap\nat zero temperature \u2206(0) using the effective potential (3).\n(i) linear decomposition\nBecause we are interested in the excitations near the\nground state, it is convenient to define\nr\n\u03bc\n\u03c6(~x, t) = \u03c6c + \u03b7(~x, t) + i\u03c7(~x, t), \u03c6c \u2261\n, (15)\n\u03bb\nwhere \u03b7 and \u03c7 are real scalar fields. This decomposition\nis known as linear decomposition. Plugging (15) into (3),\n\n\f3\n9\n\np\n\u03bb\n\u03bc2\nV =\u2212\n+ 2\u03bc\u03b7 2 + 2 \u03bb\u03bc(\u03b7 2 + \u03c72 )\u03b7 + (\u03b7 2 + \u03c72 )2 .(16)\n2\u03bb\n2\n\nIn eq. (16), the first term (at zero temperature) determines the \u03bb-temperature as shown in section 2,\n\u03bc(0)2\n= kB T\u03bb n0 .\nV0 =\n2\u03bb\n\n(17)\n\nUsing the relation \u03bc(0)/\u03bb = n0 (see, eq. (6)), we obtain\n\nroton energy gap \u2206 /kB [K]\n\nwe obtain the effective potential in terms of \u03b7 and \u03c7\n\nData in Ref.[4]\n4T\u03bb\n8.5\n\n8\n\n7.5\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\ntemperature [K]\n\n\u03bc(0) = 2kB T\u03bb .\n\n(18)\n\nThis is the direct relation between the chemical potential\nat zero temperature and the \u03bb-temperature.\nHowever, for the present purpose, the second term in\neq. (16) is more important, because the coefficient of \u03b7 2\nterm represents the potential energy of the real scalar\nfield \u03b7. Therefore, the coefficient of \u03b7 2 should be identified with the energy gap of roton at zero temperature\n\u2206(0) = 2\u03bc(0).\n\n(19)\n\nFrom eqs. (18) and (19), the roton gap \u2206(0) is given by\n\u2206(0) = 2\u03bc(0) = 4kB T\u03bb ,\n\n(20)\n\n\u2206(0)/kB T\u03bb = 4.\n\n(21)\n\nor\n\nSubstituting T\u03bb = 2.1768 K into eq. (21), one obtains\n\u2206(0)/kB = 8.707 K (theory),\n\u2206(0)/kB = 8.712 K (experiment).\n\n(22)\n(23)\n\nThus, our relation (21) is very precise. The deviation\nbetween the theoretical and experimental values is less\nthan 0.1%. Fig. 3 shows the roton energy gap as a function of temperature. From fig. 3, one can find that the\nrelation \u2206(0)/kB T\u03bb = 4 is in good agreement with the\nexperimental values at low temperatures (T < 0.8 K).\nHere we comment on the energy gap of phonon.\nBecause the coefficient of \u03c72 term in eq. (16) is zero,\nthe energy gap of the scalar field \u03c7 is exactly zero. This\nmeans that phonon is gapless, and it is a consequence of\nthe Nambu-Goldstone theorem.\n(ii) polar decomposition\nAlthough the linear decomposition is enough to calculate the roton energy gap, we consider another decomposition for completeness\nr\n\u03bc\ni\u03c0(~\nx,t)/\u03c6c\n, \u03c6c \u2261\n\u03c6(~x, t) = (\u03c6c + \u03c3(~x, t)) e\n, (24)\n\u03bb\nwhere \u03c3 and \u03c0 are real scalar fields. This is known as\npolar decomposition. Because the field \u03c0 is divided by \u03c6c ,\nthe fields \u03c3 and \u03c0 have the same physical dimensions. In\n\nFIG. 3: The roton energy gap as a function of temperature.\nThe theoretical value is in good agreement with data.\n\nthis decomposition, the field \u03c0 is the Nambu-Goldstone\nmode and \u03c3 is the Higgs mode.\nPlugging (24) into (3), we obtain the effective potential\nin terms of \u03c3\nV =\u2212\n\np\n\u03bc2\n\u03bb\n+ 2\u03bc\u03c3 2 + 2 \u03bb\u03bc\u03c3 3 + \u03c3 4 .\n2\u03bb\n2\n\n(25)\n\nThus, we find that the Nambu-Goldstone mode \u03c0 vanishes in the effective potential. The field \u03c0 appears only\nin the kinetic terms in the Lagrangian. Therefore, the\nNambu-Goldstone mode or phonon is clearly gapless.\nThe physical meaning of the 1st and 2nd terms in\neq. (25) is the same as that of linear decomposition. The\n1st term determines T\u03bb , and the 2nd term determines\n\u2206(0). Thus, the linear decomposition and the polar decomposition yield the same physical results; phonon is\ngapless and the roton gap is given by \u2206(0)/kB T\u03bb = 4.\nIV.\n\nCURVATURE MATRIX\n\nIn this section, we introduce the curvature matrix,\nwhich allows us to calculate the energy gap of elementary excitations more directly.\nFirst, let's consider the effective potential at T = 0\nV (0) = \u2212\u03bc(0)\u03c6\u2217 \u03c6 +\n\n\u03bb \u2217 2\n(\u03c6 \u03c6) .\n2\n\n(26)\n\nHere we introduce the 2 \u00d7 2 curvature matrix C\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb 2\n2\n\u2202 V (0)\n\n\uf8ec \u2202\u03c6\u2217 \u2202\u03c6\u2217\nC \u2261 \uf8ed \u2202 2 V (0)\n\u2202\u03c6\u2217 \u2202\u03c6\n\n\u03c6=\u03c6c (0)\n\n\u03c6=\u03c6c (0)\n\n\u2202 V (0)\n\u2202\u03c6\u2217 \u2202\u03c6\n\n\u2202 2 V (0)\n\u2202\u03c6\u2202\u03c6\n\n\u03c6=\u03c6c (0) \uf8f7\n\u03c6=\u03c6c (0)\n\n\uf8f8,\n\n(27)\n\nwhere \u03c6c (0) is the field value at T = 0 (see, eq.

This indicates that the roton effective mass (or equivalently, the roton kinetic energy) should be considered in order to calculate the sound\nspeed of phonon. However, at present, the theoretical explanation for eq. (35) is not known. We hope that this\nopen problem will be discussed in the community.\n\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn conclusion, we have calculated the roton energy gap\nat zero temperature using an approach based on the\nspontaneous symmetry breaking. The relation that we\nhave derived, \u2206(0)/kB T\u03bb = 4, is in good agreement with\nthe experimental value. We hope that this work contributes to the progress of low temperature physics.\n\nPhysics world, vol.10, 25 (1997).\n[4] J. S. Brooks and R. J.
