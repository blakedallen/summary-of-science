The\nconceptual device of a quantum channel is very useful in\naddressing the issues of such a transmission [4] and to\nanalyze decoherence related questions in quantum cryptography [5] and quantum teleportation [6, 7].\nA general quantum operation on an n-dimensional\nquantum system is a completely positive map. Such a\nmap defines a quantum channel for the given system and\ncan be formally represented by its operator sum representation [8, 9, 10]. One can also look at this general\nquantum evolution using affine transformations for the\nchannel [11]. In an explicit model for this evolution, the\nsystem is considered as a part of a larger closed system\nundergoing unitary evolution. The part of this larger system that we are not interested in can be thought of as\nthe environment, which when traced over, gives us the\ndynamics of the effective sub-system. The environment\ncan in general be very large. However, it turns out that\nin order to achieve the most general evolution for a system with an n-dimensional Hilbert space, we need an\nenvironment which is of dimensions n2 (if we allow the\nmost general unitary evolution of the total system and assume that the initial state of the environment is pure) [4].\nTherefore, to simulate the most general evolution of a\nsingle qubit, at least a four-dimensional (two-qubit) environment is required. However if we allow the initial\nstate of the environment to be a mixed state, there is a\npossibility of achieving such a simulation by employing a\nsmaller environment. This reduction in the dimension of\nthe Hilbert space is desirable for performing actual simulations of open quantum systems [12]. Along these lines,\nan argument based on counting the number of indepen-\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\u2020 Electronic\n\naddress: g \u0307n29@yahoo.com\naddress: arvind@quantumphys.org\n\ndent parameters suggests that a one-qubit mixed state\nenvironment might be sufficient to simulate the most general quantum evolution of a single qubit [13]. Further\ninvestigations in this direction have revealed that there\nare counter-examples to the above conjecture, and there\nare single qubit channels which cannot be simulated by\none qubit in the environment [12, 14, 15].\nWe investigate this question in detail via a different\nroute and compute the set of affine transformations for\nthis class of channels analytically, employing the canonical form for two-qubit unitary operators [16]. Restricting\nourselves to generalized depolarizing channels, we show\nthat a sizable volume (namely 85 ) of these channels cannot be simulated by a one-qubit mixed state environment.\nFurther, we show that the counter example of the twoPauli channel found by Terhal et. al. is a special case of\nour results.\nThe material in this paper is arranged as follows: in\nSection II, we explain how a one-qubit mixed state environment can be considered for the simulation of a single\nqubit channel and the significance of modeling the channel using such an environment. We consider the twoqubit unitary required for the simulation of such a channel and discuss how this class of channels could be a candidate that could occupy a sizable volume in the space of\nsingle-qubit channels. At the end of this section, the expression for the affine transformation for a general single\nqubit channel modeled using a one-qubit mixed state environment is obtained. In section III we take up the special case of generalized depolarizing channels. The affine\ntransformation for this case is obtained by setting the\nshift of the Bloch sphere origin to zero in the general expression for affine transformation developed in Section II.\nThese channels are classified by computing their singular\nvalues. From the structure of these singular values and\nthe analysis of all the possible cases the volume occupied by the generalized depolarizing channels simulated\nby a one-qubit mixed state environment is computed and\ncompared to the total volume of generalized depolarizing\nchannels. The section concludes with a discussion of the\ntwo-Pauli Channel considered as a special case of general-\n\n\f2\n\u03c1in = |\u03c8ih\u03c8|\n\n\u03c1out\n\n(Channel Input)\n\n(Channel Output)\nUd\n\n\u03c1e = (1\u2212\u03bb) I2 +\u03bb|\u03c6ih\u03c6|\n(1 qubit Mixed State)\n\n\u2749\n\u2749\n\n\u260e\n\u260e\n\nFIG. 1: Implementation of a one-qubit channel using a single\nqubit mixed state environment.

The interaction takes place via the two-qubit unitary Ud\nand the environment qubit is discarded after the interaction.\n\nized depolarizing channels and it is shown that it cannot\nbe simulated by a one-qubit mixed state environment.\nSection IV contains some concluding remarks.\n\nIn the model for the one-qubit channel that we consider, we allow the qubit of interest to interact with only\none environment qubit. The interaction unitary is allowed to be the most general two-qubit unitary and the\nenvironment qubit is a general mixed state. This channel\nis schematically depicted in Figure (1).\nFor the purpose of characterizing the channel, we consider the system qubit to be in a general pure state (a\npoint on the Bloch sphere) given by\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b8 varies from 0 to \u03c0 and \u03c6 varies from 0 to 2\u03c0.\nThe environment qubit is assumed to be in a general\nmixed state for which we choose a particular parameterization as follows:\n\u03c1e = (1 \u2212 \u03bb)\n\nI\n+ \u03bb |\u03c6ih\u03c6|\n2\n\n(2)\n\nwhere I2 corresponds to a maximally mixed state and |\u03c6i\ncorresponds to a general pure state given by\n\u03be\n\u03be\n|\u03c6i = cos |0i + e\u2212i\u03b7 sin |1i\n2\n2\n\nU = (U1 \u2297 V1 ) Ud (U2 \u2297 V2 )\nU \u2208 SU (4); and U1 , U2 , V1 , V2 \u2208 SU (2)\n\n(4)\n\nThis is pictorially shown in Figure 2.\nThis three-parameter family of interaction unitaries\nhas the power to entangle or unentangle the qubits involved.

The number of independent parameters \u03bbj can\nbe reduced to three by a global phase change.\nThis transformation matrix can be readily transformed\ninto the product basis {|00i, |01i, |10i, |11i} to obtain\n\nII.

This most general unitary which is an\nSU (4) transformation has fifteen independent parameters. However, it has been shown that an arbitrary twoqubit unitary can be decomposed into local unitaries on\neach qubit sandwiching a non-trivial interaction unitary.\nThis interaction unitary Ud belongs to a three-parameter\nfamily of transformations [16].\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03be varies from 0 to \u03c0 and \u03b7 varies from 0 to 2\u03c0.\nTherefore, the environment state can be thought of as\na mixture of a completely mixed state and a pure state.\nThe parameter \u03bb indicates the degree to which the state\nis mixed. By varying \u03bb from 1 to 0, we can go from a\npure to a maximally mixed state of the environment.\nThe interaction that takes place between the system\nqubit and the environment qubit corresponds to a general unitary operator in the four-dimensional (two-qubit)\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\n\uf8ec\nUdProd = \uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\ncos \u03b1+\u03b3\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n\ni sin \u03b1+\u03b3\n2\n\n0\n\n\u2212i\u03b2\n\u2212i\u03b2\ni sin \u03b1\u2212\u03b3\ncos \u03b1\u2212\u03b3\n2 e\n2 e\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\u2212i\u03b2\n\u2212i\u03b2\ncos \u03b1\u2212\u03b3\ni sin \u03b1\u2212\u03b3\n2 e\n2 e\n\n0\n\ni sin \u03b1+\u03b3\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\ncos \u03b1+\u03b3\n2\n(6)\n\nwhere\n\u03b1 = (\u03bb1 \u2212 \u03bb2 \u2212 \u03bb3 + \u03bb4 )/2,\n\u03b2 = \u2212(\u03bb1 + \u03bb2 + \u03bb3 + \u03bb4 )/2,\n\u03b3 = (\u03bb1 \u2212 \u03bb2 + \u03bb3 \u2212 \u03bb4 )/2\n\n(7)\n\nWe are considering a quantum channel for a single\nqubit with another qubit acting as the environment and\na general unitary transformation (described above) providing the interaction between the two qubits. It is easy\nto see that the properties of the channel do not change\nwith the local unitary transformations U1 , V1 and U2 , V2 .\nTherefore, for the analysis of the family of such channels,\nthe interaction unitary that needs to be considered is the\nthree-parameter family given in (??). The final output\nstate of the system \u03c1out emerging from the channel after\nthe action of Ud is obtained by tracing over the environment qubit.\nMathematically, a one-qubit channel can be described\nin a number of ways, and we find it useful to picture it\nin terms of an affine transformation of the Bloch sphere.\nThe quantum states of a single qubit on the Bloch sphere\ncan be represented as follows:\n\u03c1=\n\n1\n(I + n.\u03c3)\n2\n\n(8)\n\n\f3\nU1\n\nU2\nUd\n\nV1\n\nV2\n\nFIG. 2: Schematic Diagram for a two-qubit unitary. The local\nunitaries U1 , V1 , U2 , V2 together with Ud , which is diagonal in\nthe special Bell basis, provide a decomposition of a general\nSU (4) transformation.\n\nwhere the \u03c3's are Pauli matrices, and n is a 3-component\nreal vector. For pure states |n| = 1, and for mixed states\n|n| < 1. Any arbitrary trace-preserving quantum operation on (8) is given by a map of the form \u03c1 \u2192 \u03c1\u2032 , with\nthe new vector determining \u03c1\u2032 given by\nn\u2032i =\n\n3\nX\n\nMij nj + Ci .\n\n(9)\n\nj=1\n\nwhere Mij are the nine components of a 3 \u00d7 3 real matrix\nM and Ci are the three components of a constant real\ncolumn vector C. This map, called the affine map, maps\nthe Bloch sphere (including its interior) onto a shifted\nellipsoid with its major axis less than 2 [2, 11],\nThe total number of independent parameters defining\nthis map are twelve. The matrix M amounts to a combination of proper rotations and contractions in different\ndirections of the vectors on the Bloch sphere. The vector\nC corresponds to a shift in the origin of the Bloch sphere.\nTwo channels which differ from each other by a unitary transformation of the qubit before and after the action of the channel are identical. Thus, we can utilize\nthis freedom of performing arbitrary proper rotations of\nthe Bloch sphere before and after the channel action to\nsimplify the affine transformations for the channel. This\nconverts the matrix M into a 'singular-value' form with\nsingular values appearing along the diagonal.\nMd = R M S\n\n(10)\n\nwhere R and S are real orthogonal matrices with unit determinant and Md is a diagonal matrix with the squares\nof its three diagonal elements given by the eigen values of\nthe positive semi-definite matrix M \u2020 M . The shift vector\nC is mapped onto another such vector under these two\nproper rotations. After utilizing this freedom through\nthe action of R and S, the number of independent parameters for single qubit channels is clearly six: namely\nthe three singular values of the matrix Md , plus the three\ncomponents of the vector C. There is a further restriction\nof complete positivity on the allowed affine transformations; however, that does not reduce the number of independent parameters [2, 8, 18]. These affine transformations provide us with a complete description of one-qubit\nchannels.\nWe now turn to an explicit calculation to obtain the\naffine transformation given in equation (9) for the class\n\nof channels simulatable by a one-qubit mixed state environment described in Figure (1) (taking a general initial\nsystem state \u03c1 = |\u03c8ih\u03c8| to \u03c1out ). For this purpose, we\nconsider six points on the input Bloch sphere corresponding to the eigen states of the operators Sx , Sy and Sz\nand calculate the output density matrix for each of these\npoints. At the end of this lengthy algebraic calculation,\nthe affine transformation turns out to be\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\ncos \u03b1 cos \u03b2\n\u2212\u03bb cos \u03b1 \u2212\u03bb sin \u03b1 cos \u03b2\n\uf8ec\nsin \u03b2 cos \u03be\nsin \u03b7 sin \u03be \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\ncos \u03b2 cos \u03b3 \u2212\u03bb cos \u03b2 sin \u03b3 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec \u03bb sin \u03b2\nM =\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\ncos \u03b7 sin \u03be \uf8f7\n\uf8ec cos \u03b3 cos \u03be\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed \u03bb sin \u03b1 cos \u03b3 \u03bb cos \u03b1 sin \u03b3\nsin \u03be sin \u03b7\nsin \u03be cos \u03b7\ncos \u03b3 cos \u03b1\n(11)\nThe corresponding shift is\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\u2212\u03bb sin \u03b1 sin \u03b2 sin \u03be cos \u03b7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n(12)\nC = \uf8ed \u03bb sin \u03b2 sin \u03b3 sin \u03be sin \u03b7 \uf8f8\n\u2212\u03bb sin \u03b3 sin \u03b1 cos \u03be\nThis affine transformation gives a parameterization of all\nthe channels simulated by a one-qubit mixed state environment. We have thus obtained a closed form expression\nfor the complete class of channels for a single qubit simulated by a one-qubit environment. This class of channels\nis a six-parameter family with the six parameters being\n\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b7, \u03be and \u03bb. We obtained this form by computing\nthe action of the channel explicitly on several test states\nuntil the transformation is uniquely determined.\nAs we have observed, the number of independent parameters for a single qubit channel simulated using this\nmixed state environment also turns out to be six. It\nhad thus been conjectured that all single qubit channels\nmay be simulatable using a single qubit mixed state as\nthe environment [13]. Despite counter-examples like the\ntwo-Pauli channel, the possibility that the set of single\nqubit channels simulated using a mixed state environment may occupy a sizable volume in the space of single\nqubit channels remains open, and it may turn out that\nthe counter examples are a set of measure zero in the\nchannel space. This is precisely the question that will be\nexplored and resolved in the following section, using the\nclosed form expression given in equations( 11) and (12).\nIII.\n\nTHE GENERALIZED DEPOLARIZING\nCHANNEL\n\nThe general expression for the family of channels obtained in the previous section is very useful, and several special cases are of particular interest. We consider\nthe case of generalized depolarizing channels defined as\nthe ones for which the origin of the Bloch sphere is not\nshifted. This class is simple and we know that it contains non-trivial examples which cannot be implemented\n\n\f4\nusing a one-qubit pure state environment. We therefore\nanalyze this sub-class in some detail. The operator sum\nrepresentation of this class is given by\n\u2032\n\n\u03c1\u2192\u03c1 =\n\n3\nX\n\n\u01ebj Aj \u03c1A\u2020j\n\n(13)\n\nimportant question we would like to address is how many\ngeneralized depolarizing channels are contained in the\naffine transformation (15).\nA.\n\nVolume issues\n\nj=0\n\nWhere A0 is the identity matrix and for j = 1, 2, 3 we\nhave Aj = \u03c3j and we have \u01eb0 + \u01eb1 + \u01eb2 + \u01eb3 = 1. The\ncorresponding affine transformation is\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\u01eb0 +\u01eb1 \u2212\u01eb2 \u2212\u01eb3\n0\n0\n\uf8f8\n0\n\u01eb0 \u2212\u01eb1 +\u01eb2 \u2212\u01eb3\n0\nM DP = \uf8ed\n0\n0\n\u01eb0 \u2212\u01eb1 \u2212\u01eb2 + \u01eb3\n(14)\nThe shift C is zero indicating that it is indeed a generalized depolarizing channel. The three diagonal entries\nof the matrix M DP take values such that this family of\ngeneralized depolarizing channels is geometrically represented by a tetrahedron volume with vertices given by\n(1, \u22121, \u22121) (\u22121, 1, \u22121) (\u22121, \u22121, 1) (1, 1, 1). Each value\nof x, y, z which lies inside this volume is an allowed set\nof diagonal elements for the affine transformation M DP\nfor the generalized depolarizing channel [12, 18, 19]. The\nvolume of this tetrahedron is 83 . The vertices of the tetrahedron represent a unitary map for which we require only\none operator in the operator sum representation. The\nedges represent the two operator maps and the faces represent three operators maps while the points inside the\ntetrahedron require all the four operators for their realization. The families of two-Pauli channels which will be\ndiscussed in the next sub-section are represented on the\nfaces of the tetrahedron (not including the edges).\nThe affine transformation corresponding to one-qubit\ngeneralized depolarizing channels, with a single qubit as\nthe environment, can be obtained by setting the shift vector C to zero and thereby simplifying the equation (12).\nIt turns out that this can be achieved in eleven different\nways, leading to eleven different cases. For each case, we\ncompute the singular values of the affine transformation\nwhich suffice to characterize the channel. Although the\nalgebra is a little involved, the final result in each case\nturns out to be rather simple. In each case the affine\ntransformation can be brought to the following form, by\nlocal unitaries before and after the channel action:\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\ncos a cos b\n0\n0\nDP\n\uf8f8\n0\ncos b cos c\n0\nMOne\u2212qubit\n=\uf8ed\n0\n0\ncos c cos a\n(15)\nwhere a, b c depend upon the six parameters of the channel namely \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03be, \u03b7, and \u03bb.\nOne can immediately see that the normal depolarizing channel which maps the entire Bloch sphere onto the\norigin, and which cannot be simulated using a one-qubit\npure state environment, is contained here. It corresponds\nto any pair from a, b, c taking values \u03c0/2. However, the\n\nWe are interested in finding the volume inside the\ntetrahedron occupied by the affine transformation represented by equation (15). This will help us explore the\nfraction of depolarizing channels simulatable using a onequbit mixed state environment.\nThe constraints which are imposed by the structure of\nequation (15) can be analytically worked out and turn\nout to be\nxy \u2264 z;\n\nyz \u2264 x;\n\nzx \u2264 y\n\n(16)\n\nwhere x = cos a cos b, y = cos b cos c and z = cos c cos a.\nThe volume constrained by these conditions is shown in\nFigure (3). All the vertices and the edges of the tetrahedron are touched. However no point on any of the faces\nis contained. It can be visualized as if each face of the\ntetrahedron has been scooped out and the depth of this\nscoop extends all the way to the centroid. The volume\nenclosed by this shape can be computed and it turns out\nto be 1. This implies that only 83 of the generalized depolarizing channels can be simulated by a one-qubit mixed\nstate environment. To give a more visual feel for this\nvolume we depict its cross sections for different z values\nin Figure (4). At each value of z the tetrahedron cross\nsection is a rectangle and the darkened area is the cross\nsection of the volume depicted in Figure (3) (cross sectional views for constant x and y will look identical).\nB.\n\nTwo-Pauli channel\n\nWe now turn to an interesting sub-family of depolarizing channels, namely, the two-Pauli channel. Two-pauli\nchannels are the ones for which only one of {\u01eb1 , \u01eb2 , \u01eb3 } is\nzero and they are represented on the faces of the tetrahedron (leaving out the edges).\nFurther, for simplicity we restrict ourselves to a special\ncase of a one-parameter sub-family of two-Pauli channels\nfor which the nonzero elements are given by \u01eb2 = 0 and\n\u01eb1 = \u01eb2 = (1 \u2212 \u03ba)/2 and \u01eb0 = \u03ba. with 0 \u2264 \u03ba \u2264 1. The\naffine transformation for the two-Pauli channel can be\neasily computed and is given by\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\u03ba\n0\n0\n\u03ba\n0\uf8f8\nM 2\u2212Pauli = \uf8ed 0\n(17)\n0\n0 2\u03ba \u2212 1\nThis is a special case of the generalized depolarizing channels which is represented by a line on the face of the\ntetrahedron joining the vertex (1, 1, 1) to the mid point\nof the edge below it. We take this particular case because\nit has been discussed in detail in the literature.\n\n\f5\n(1,1,1)\n\n1\n\nz=\u22121.0\n\n1\n\n1\n\nz=\u22120.8\n\n1\n\nz=\u22120.6\n\n(-1,-1,1)\n\n-1\n\n-1\n1\n\n-1\n\n0\n1\n\nz=\u22120.4\n\n-1\n1\n\n-1\n1\n\nz=\u22120.2\n\n1\n\n-1\n1\n\nz=\u22120.1\n\n(1,-1,-1)\n-1\n(-1,1,-1)\n\n1\n0\n\n1\n\n-1\n\n-1\n1\n\n-1\n\n0\n-1\n\n-1\n1\n\n-1\n\n1\n\n-1\n\n-1\n\nFIG. 3: Graphical representation of the volume occupied by\nchannels simulatable by a one-qubit mixed state environment.\nThis volume is 38 of the volume of the tetrahedron which represents all possible generalized depolarizing channels.

For the matrix (15) to take the form (17), two of its entries should\nbecome equal; let us assume that first two are equal.\nThis forces cos a = cos c and this further implies that\ncosa is a factor of all the singular values. However, the\naffine transformation (17) does not have a non-trivial factor and hence the only possibility is cos a = 1. Now we\nimpose the relationship between the equal and unequal\nsingular values leading to 2 cos b \u2212 1 = 1 which implies\nthat cos b = 1. A similar result is obtained if we begin\nby equating any other pair of singular values in equation (15). The above analysis shows that the only place\nwhere the two-Pauli affine transformation can match the\naffine transformation (15) is when \u03ba = 1, at which point\nthe two-Pauli channel disappears and one is left with the\nidentity transformation. Thus we conclude that the twoPauli channel is not a special case of (15). This result\nhas been obtained earlier, where it was shown that the\ntwo-Pauli channel is a counter-example to the conjecture\nthat a one-qubit mixed state environment can simulate\nall one-qubit quantum channels. Our demonstration is\nsimpler and analytical, since we have obtained the explicit expression for the affine transformation. It is not\ndifficult to generalize this argument for the other twoPauli channels. Results about the points on the face of\nthe tetrahedron not modelable using a one-qubit mixed\nstate environment, are actually contained in the volume\nanalysis of the previous section.

This parameterization has been\nobtained analytically by computing the affine transformation corresponding to this class of channels. Applying our results to the sub-class of depolarizing channels,\nwe found that although a sizable volume ( 38 of the total\nvolume) is modeled by a one-qubit mixed state environment, there is a finite volume in the channel space ( 58 of\nthe total volume) which cannot be modeled in this fashion. The special case of the two-Pauli channel discussed\nin the literature has been shown to be in this missing volume and hence is not simulatable via a one-qubit mixed\nstate environment. The results were achieved by starting\nwith the general expression for the affine transformation,\nrestricting it to the case with zero shift, and computing\nthe singular values. It turns out that we can arrive at the\nprecise constraints on the volume analytically, thereby\nproducing a picture of the subset of generalized depolarizing channels simulatable by a one-qubit mixed state in\n\nthe environment.\nThe affine transformation which we obtain is general\nand one can also explore channels other than the depolarizing channels. The analysis of the volume occupied by\nsuch channels in the entire channel space for one qubit is\nan involved problem and will be taken up elsewhere. We\nnote that a similar conclusion about the two-Pauli channel from a very different perspective has been obtained\nin [20].\n\n[1] W. H. Zurek, Rev. Mod. Phys. 75, 715 (2003).\n[2] M. A.
