Gd\n\nSpin manipulation in semiconductors has seen remarkable theoretical and experimental interest in recent years\nwith the advent of spin-electronics and with the realization that strong spin-orbit coupling in certain materials\ncan influence the transport of carriers in so-called spintronics devices [3]. In particular, the issue of creating\nspin polarization of carriers in nonmagnetic semiconductors with spin-orbit coupling using only electric fields has\ncaused a flurry of theoretical and experimental activity\n[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. Two kinds of\ntheories of spin-polarization under the action of an electric field have been put forward. The first kind, dating\nback since the mid 1980's [9], predicts the existence of a\nspatially homogeneous net spin polarization perpendicular to the applied electric current in two dimensional\nsamples with spin-orbit interaction. This effect is dissipative and has been recently observed experimentally\n[17]. There also exist two very recent [4, 5] theories predicting non-dissipative, intrinsic spin currents with the\nspin polarization and flow direction perpendicular to each\nother and to the electric field. This effect does not create a bulk magnetization but, if observed, can be used\nfor spin injection, and its validity is being experimentally\ntested at the present time. One of the theories [5] predicts a spin current polarized out of plane and flowing\nperpendicular to the in-plane electric field applied on a\n2-dimensional semiconductor sample exhibiting Rashba\nspin-orbit coupling. As long as the Rashba spin splitting is large enough, the spin conductivity is 'universal'\n(e/8\u03c0~) in the sense that it does not depend on the value\nof the coupling. The other effect [4] appears in the valence band of the bulk samples and is proportional to the\nspin-orbit splitting of the valence bands (to the difference\nbetween the Fermi momenta of the heavy and light-hole\nbands).\nIn the first part of this letter we analyze the theory behind two recent experiments in bulk strained semiconductors [1, 2] where an electric-field-induced uniform homogeneous spin polarization upon an applied electric field\nis observed. We make the case that the observed spinsplitting (whose origin is puzzling) and spin polarization is due to a previously overlooked strain-spin-splitting\n\nterm, and propose easy experimental checks of our theory.\nIn the second part of this letter we predict the appearance of an intrinsic spin polarized spin current in\nn-doped bulk (and 2 dimensional) strained semiconductors (GaAs, GaSb, InSb, InGaAs, AlGaAS, etc) under\nthe influence of an electric field. The spin conductance\nis 'universal', in the sense that it does not depend on the\nvalue of strain (for large enough strain), but it is proportional to the average Fermi momentum of the conduction band. The effect is due to the spin-orbit splitting of\nthe conduction band under strain and is hence absent in\nstrain-free semiconductors. The very long spin relaxation\ntime in the conduction band as well as the relative penetration of strain engineering in semiconductor industry\napplications make this effect of potential technological\nimportance. We propose an experimental technique using the already existing setup in [1, 2] to measure the\nspin current and to differentiate between the intrinsic\nspin current and the uniform magnetization effects.\nIn [1] nine samples of n-doped (n = 3 \u00d7 1016 cm\u22123 )\nInx Ga1\u2212x As (x = 5% \u2212 7%) of thicknesses between\n200nm \u2212 1500nm, grown in the [001] direction on undoped GaAs substrate, are used to probe the electron\nspin dynamics through time and spatially resolved Faraday rotation (FR). The length and width of the samples\nare roughly 300\u03bcm \u00d7 80\u03bcm. The lattice mismatch provides for diagonal strain in the x, y, z = [100], [010], [001]\ndirections of 0.04% \u2212 0.46% [18] (contrary to claims in\n[31], the lattice constants in x and y directions are also\nstrained, this being a generic feature of [001] growth).\nMoreover, anisotropic shear strain develops in all directions (xy, xz, yz = [110], [101], [011]) due to different\ndirection-dependent strain relaxation rates at the growth\ntemperature of around 500C [19]. This guarantees that\nall the components of the strain tensor \u01ebij , i, j = x, y, z\nare non-zero and of the same order of magnitude. The\nmagnitude of the strain components is given in Table[1].\nPump-probe FR beams measure the total magnetization of the optically injected electron spins in the\ngrowth direction z when the samples are placed in an\nelectric field on the [110] and [11\u03040] directions, respec-\n\n\f2\ntively. The dynamics of the spin packet is mainly described by a precession around a total magnetic field\n~ tot = B\n~ int + B\n~ ext where B\n~ ext is an externally applied\nB\n~\nmagnetic field whereas Bint is the momentum-dependent\ninternal magnetic field caused by the spin-orbit coupling.\n~ int is the main feature of\nThe precession around a B\nmost of the spintronics devices, starting with the DasDatta spin-field transistor [22]. Under an applied electric\nfield, the average particle momentum acquires a non-zero\nvalue, parallel to the electric field. The internal magnetic\nfield is caused by the spin orbit coupling: the electric field\nacts on the particle momentum which in turn couples to\nthe spin. The signal at the probe beam can be fitted to\n~ int + B\n~ ext |\u2206t/~) where \u03bcB is the Bohr magnecos(g\u03bcB |B\nton, g is the electron g-factor while \u2206t is the temporal\ndelay between the pump and probe pulses. This fit gives\n~ int which turns out to be perthe direction and value of B\npendicular to the applied electric field E and the \u1e91 axis\n~ int is used to determine\n(for E in-plane); the value of B\nthe spin splitting \u22060 = g\u03bcB Bint and a phenomenological\nrelation \u22060 = \u03b2vd is observed where vd is the spin-drift\nvelocity and \u03b2 is a constant of proportionality that is the\nfocus of the experiment [1]. Experiments find that vd is\nlinearly proportional to the electric field E.\nAs a first step, let us theoretically address the question of origin of \u03b2. By group theory, inversion symmetry breaking bulk strained semiconductors exhibit three\nmain types of spin splitting [23]:\n~2 2\nk + H1 + H2 + H 3 ,\nH=\n2m\nH1 = \u03bb[\u03c3x kx (ky2 \u2212 kz2 ) + \u03c3y ky (kz2 \u2212 kx2 ) + \u03c3z kz (kx2 \u2212 ky2 )]\n1\nH2 = C3 [\u03c3x (\u01ebxy ky \u2212 \u01ebxz kz ) + \u03c3y (\u01ebyz kz \u2212 \u01ebyx kx )+\n2\n+ \u03c3z (\u01ebzx kx \u2212 \u01ebzy ky )]\nH3 = D[\u03c3x kx (\u01ebzz \u2212\u01ebyy )+\u03c3y ky (\u01ebxx \u2212\u01ebzz )+\u03c3z kz (\u01ebyy \u2212\u01ebxx)]\n(1)\n\n~ int for the\nFIG. 1: Direction of the internal magnetic field B\nthree spin splitting Hamiltonians H1 , H2 , H3 , (\u03bb, C3 , D > 0)\nconsidering the electric field E (and hence the average momentum) to be in plane. It was also assumed that \u01ebxx = \u01ebyy ,\nas appropriate in the experiment [1]. The experimental SIA\ndata cannot be explained by the term H2 , but nevertheless,\nthe SIA-type Bint seen in the experiment has the same direction as the one plotted here. When E||x or E||y, the BIA\nterm H3 induces a Bint ||E whereas the BIA term H1 does not\ninduce spin splitting for these directions. This constitutes a\nsimple check of the experiment\n\nm = 0.0665m0 is the effective electron mass in the conduction band [24], \u03bb, C3 , D > 0 are material constants,\n\u03c3x,y,z are the 3 spin-Pauli matrices,and \u01ebij , i, j = x, y, z\nare the components of the symmetric strain tensor.\nAll three Hamiltonians can be written as the coupling\n~ int\nof a fictitious k-dependent internal magnetic field B\n~\nto the electron spin, Bint (k)~\u03c3 = Bx (k)\u03c3x + By (k)\u03c3y +\nBz (k)\u03c3z (an overall factor of g\u03bcB has been absorbed into\nthe definition of B to simplify notation). The directions\n~ int as dependent on the directions of ~k are shown\nof B\n~ int that keeps\nin Fig[1]. The SIA-type term gives a B\n~\n~\nits orientation as k(||E) is rotated between the [110] and\n~ int coming from\n[11\u03040] directions, while both BIA-type B\nH1 and H3 change their sign between [110] and [11\u03040].\nThe difference between H1 and H3 is that the latter has\n~ int when E||x,\n~\na finite B\ny whereas the former has zero\nBint for the same directions.\n\nIn [1] the values of the splitting \u03b2 are measured on\nthe [110] and [11\u03040] directions and because of the sign~ int mentioned above, the BIA\nchanging properties of B\nand the SIA contributions to \u03b2 can be obtained as follows:\n\u03b2BIA = (\u03b2[110] \u2212 \u03b2[11\u03040] )/2, \u03b2SIA = (\u03b2[110] + \u03b2[11\u03040] )/2.\nSurprisingly, the spin splitting is more of a BIA-type\nrather than an SIA-type, contradicting the conventional\nknowledge that an SIA-type term described by H2 is responsible for spin splitting in strained semiconductors\n[23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29].\nTheoretically, the Dresselhaus term H1 is a bulkinversion asymmetry term that appears even in the absence of strain. As observed in the experiment, the ficti~ int is perpendicular to the\ntious internal magnetic field B\n~\n~\n~\nmomentum k: Bint (k)k = 0, where Bx = \u03bbkx (ky2 \u2212 kz2 ),\nBy and Bz being obtained by cubic permutation. For\n\n\f3\nGaAs, the constant \u03bb = 22eV \u00c53 . However, we believe\nthis term is not responsible for the spin splitting observed\nin the experiment [1]. The observed splitting is linear in\nmomentum k, inconsistent with the H1 \u223c k 3 . Experiments performed on InSb [29], another material with\ninversion asymmetry, support this conclusion and point\nstrongly to the fact that strained InSb is described by\nH2 . In [29] stress of up to 4 kbar is applied mechanically on a 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 10mm3 sample and Shubnikov-deHaas oscilations are used to probe the band structure.\nWithout applied strain, the conduction band exhibits\na spin-splitting that is small and cubic in k, described\nby H1 . In [29] the application of diagonal does not induce any observable spin splitting whereas the application of shear strain induces a splitting linear in k, described by H2 . Relatively large stress-induced splitting\nof the Fermi surfaces occurs in the lower concentration\n(n = 1.4 \u00d7 1015 \u2212 2.0 \u00d7 1017 cm\u22123 ) samples [29]. The\nenergy splitting dispersion switches from k 3 in the unstrained case to k when strain (stress) above 1kbar is applied, in accordance to H2 becoming dominant over H1 .\nFrom a theoretical estimate, at n = 3 \u00d7 1016 cm\u22123 , H1\nshould be of the same size as H3 and roughly one order\nof magnitude lower than H2 . The spin splitting at the\nFermi wavevector kF = 0.96 \u00d7 108 m\u22121 due to H1 is less\nthan 10\u22125 eV . By contrast the spin splitting due to H2 is\nC3 \u01ebxy kF = 5.06 \u00d7 10\u22122 \u01ebxy eV = 5 \u00d7 10\u22125 \u2212 15 \u00d7 10\u22125 eV\nfor \u01ebxy = 0.1%\u22120.3% as in [1] (see Table[1] for conversion\nof strain components from [1] to the orthogonal system\n\u01ebxy ). An experimental value of C3 /~ = 8 \u00d7 105 m/s for\nGaAs was used [30]. Contrary to previous remarks [31],\nthere is hence no theoretical or experimental a-priori reason to disregard the strain-dependent spin splitting terms\nin favor of the Dresselhaus k 3 term for the doping values\nin the experiment [1].\nThere are a number of experimental reasons in [1] hinting the marginal significance of the k 3 term. In [1] strain\nplays a critical role in generating the spin-orbit coupling\n~ int . Samples prepared from the same wafer but unB\nstrained show a reduction by an order of magnitude of\nBint along both the [110] and the [11\u03040] directions. If H1\nwere responsible for spin splitting, its value would remain\nunchanged upon varying strain. Strain could only enter\nthe system through the variation of the effective electron\nmass in the x, y, z directions, as [31] points out. However,\nthese variations with strain are of a maximum 2% \u2212 3%\n[24, 31] thereby not accounting for the order of magnitude variation of the spin-splitting between the strained\nand the unstrained cases observed in [1].\nThe term H2 is a structural inversion asymmetry\n(SIA)-type term that has its origin in the acoustic phonon\ninteraction of the valence band with the conduction band\n[23]. In the framework of the Kane's 8 \u00d7 8 matrix (2 \u00d7 2\nfor the conduction and split-off band and 4 \u00d7 4 for the\nvalence band) the conduction band couples to the valence band. In systems with inversion symmetry where\n\nthe selection rules for L are satisfied, it is impossible\nto couple spin-0 (|si) with spin-1 (|zi) through a spin2 term (\u01ebij ) and hence hs|\u01ebxy |zi = 0. However, when\ninversion symmetry is broken, the fore-mentioned term\nneed not be zero as the L selection rule need not apply.\nUpon straining, the matrix elements between the conduction and valence band have the form hs|\u01ebxy |zi (plus\ncyclic permutations) where |si is the s-orbital and |zi\nis one of the p orbitals. Through perturbation theory,\none can compute the effect of this valence-conduction\nband interaction when projected to the conduction band\nand obtain the conduction band effective Hamiltonian\nH2 [23, 26, 27, 28]. Taking into account that the electric\nfield is in-plane (< kz >= 0) and that \u01ebxy 6= 0 (see\nTable[1]), in H2 the components of the internal magnetic field (which due to the rescaling by g\u03bcB has units\nof energy) are: Bx = 12 C3 \u01ebxy ky , By = \u2212 12 C3 \u01ebyx kx =\n\u2212 21 C3 \u01ebxy kx . Switching coordinates to the [110] and [11\u03040]\ndirections, B[110] = 21 C3 \u01ebxy k[11\u03040] , B[11\u03040] = \u2212 12 C3 \u01ebxy k[110]\n(see Fig[1]. Since H2 is an SIA term, the spin splitting\nth\n\u03b2 will be of SIA type \u03b2SIA\n(th stands for the theoretical\nestimate). Since < k >= ~1 mvd where vd is the drift velocity of the spin packed due to the electric field, we get\na simple formula for the\nth\n\u03b2SIA\n=\n\nC3\n\u01ebxy m\n~\n\n(2)\n\nBy using the experimentally known value for C3 /~ =\nth\n8 \u00d7 105 m/2, the predicted values for \u03b2SIA\nare given in\nTable I. The theoretical values are larger than the observed ones by a factor of 3 \u2212 30 and no matching trend\nbetween the data and the SIA term H2 can be found.\nMoreover, as remarked in [1] no systematic correlation\nbetween the experimentally observed SIA contribution\nand the strain is observed. We hence come to the conclusion that the SIA spin splitting observed in [1] is not\ninduced by the uniform shear strain (which would give\nth\nthe values \u03b2SIA\nand which have been confirmed in mechanical experiments) but borrows substantially from the\ndislocations and strain gradient inherent in growing such\na thick sample through MBE techniques. This is not to\nsay that the SIA term is negligible: as seen in Table I\nthe SIA term is substantial and comparable in magnitude with the BIA term. However, the SIA term does\nnot correlate with strain ad cannot be described by H2 .\nThe remaining spin splitting term is H3 . Although\nthis term is allowed by group theory, it only shows up\nat higher order in perturbation theory than H2 in the\nk * p method. We claim that in the experiment [1] this\nterm is responsible for the spin-splitting observed, and\ndetermine the value of the constant D. We note, however, that this does not settle the theoretical puzzle of\nwhy the H3 would be more significant than H2 in this\ncase, which might have to do with the conditions of\nthe experiment such as low temperature, the appearance of dislocations and strain gradient.

The conversion equations, obtained after a simple coordinate transformation, are: \u01ebzz = \u01eb[001] , \u01ebxx = \u01ebyy =\n1\n(\u01eb\n+ \u01eb[11\u03040] ), \u01ebxy = 12 (\u01eb[110] \u2212 \u01eb[11\u03040] ). The measured spin\n2 [110]\nexp\nexp\nsplitting slope values \u03b2SIA\nand \u03b2BIA\nas well as the theoretth\nical value \u03b2SIA obtained using the Hamiltonians H2 for the\nSIA - type splitting are given in neV nS \u03bcm\u22121 , the units of\n[1]. The value of the deformation potential D in the term\nH3 , determined as explained in Eq(4) is given for each samexp\nth\nple. The discrepancies between the values of \u03b2SIA\nand \u03b2SIA\nmake the case that H2 is not the full mechanism for strain\nSIA splitting. For five (A, E, F, G, I) out of the seven samples the values of the deformation potential D deduced from\nthe H3 model of the strain BIA splitting are within 30% of\neach other. Combined with the simplicity of the model, this\nmatch gives weight to the suggestion that BIA splitting is\nexp\nproduced by a BIA term. \u03b2BIA\n/(\u01ebzz \u2212 \u01ebxx ) is measured in\n2\n\u22121\n10 neV nS \u03bcm , while D is measured in 104 m/s\n\ntonian of BIA-type and vanishes with vanishing strain,\nthereby satisfying two of the experimental observations\n~ int reads:\nin [1]. From Eq.[1], the internal magnetic field B\nBx = Dkx (\u01ebzz \u2212 \u01ebyy ), By = Dky (\u01ebxx \u2212 \u01ebxx ), Bz =\nDkz (\u01ebyy \u2212 \u01ebxx ), and since the in-plane electric field influences only the in-plane momentum, < kz >= 0 and\nonly the two in-plane components of the internal magnetic field remain. In accordance with the experiment,\nwe place \u01ebxx = \u01ebyy , and \u01ebzz \u2212 \u01ebxx > 0 (Table[I]). We\nhence have Bx = kx D(\u01ebzz \u2212 \u01ebxx ), By = ky D(\u01ebxx \u2212 \u01ebzz ),\n~ int is not perpendicular to ~k||E:\n~\nD(\u01ebzz \u2212\u01ebxx ) > 0. Since B\nBx kx + By ky = (kx2 \u2212 ky2 )D(\u01ebzz \u2212 \u01ebxx ), one may think\n~ int \u22a5 E||\n~ ~k\nthis term is incompatible with the observed B\nin [1]. This, however, would be hasty: the experiment\n~\nis performed in only two directions, with E||[110]\nand\n~\nE||[11\u03040], for which kx = \u00b1ky . For these two directions\n~ int in H3 is perpendicular to the momentum\nonly, the B\nand the electric field, hence satisfying a major constraint\nthe experimental data poses on the theory. Since the\nvalue of the constant D is unknown from previous experimental studies (although it was suggested that they can\nbe sometimes sizable [32]) there is no way of theoretically\npredicting the values of the spin-splitting from our model.\nHowever, we can check if the model is consistent with the\nexperimental data and we can also obtain a value of the\nconstant D which, being a material constant, should be\nsimilar on all the samples cited here. Since < k >= m\n~ vd\n\nwhere vd is the spin drift velocity along the spin packet\nwe find:\nth\n\u03b2[BIA]\n=2\n\nD\n(\u01ebzz \u2212 \u01ebxx )m\n~\n\n(3)\n\nWe can determine the value of D from the experimental\ndata for \u03b2 and strain \u01eb:\nexp\n1 \u03b2[BIA]\nD\n=\n~\n2m \u01ebzz \u2212 \u01ebxx\n\n(4)\n\nAs a consistency check, since D is a material constant,\nexp\n\u03b2[BIA]\n/(\u01ebzz \u2212 \u01ebxx ) should be quasi-constant between the\nsamples quoted in the experiment. In 5 out of the 7\nexp\nsamples studied in [1], the values of \u03b2[BIA]\n/(\u01ebzz \u2212 \u01ebxx )\nare close together to within 30%, lumped in two groups\n(samples A, I are very close to each other, and within\n30% of the value for E, F, G which are again very close\nbetween themselves). The samples E, F, G were grown in\nthe same day. The deviant samples B, H were also grown\nin the same day, and hence the variation of the constant\ncoefficient D within a sample set that was grown on the\nsame day is less than 15% [21]. Different growth conditions are most likely responsible for the (still small)\nvariations between samples grown in different days. The\nconsistency check is further proof that H3 is the term responsible to the spin-splitting in [1]. The values obtained\nfor D are given in Table[I].\nWe showed that H3 is a BIA-type Hamiltonian vanishing with vanishing strain, with an internal magnetic field\nthat is perpendicular to the applied electric field for the\ntwo experimental directions [110] and [11\u03040] and which is\nconsistent with the reported data for the spin splitting.\nOn the other hand, H1 and H2 , the previously known\nspin splitting terms, fail to reproduce the data on more\nthan several counts.It is easy to experimentally prove,\nusing the setup in [1], that H3 is responsible for the spin\nsplitting is easy: one would measure the internal magnetic field due to BIA on the x or y direction. In this\ncase, an H3 term would give an internal magnetic field\n~ (of course, there will also be an internal B\n~\nparallel to E\n~\nfrom an SIA term that is still perpendicular to E, but\n~ int parrallel to the electric field should\na component of B\nbe easily detectable).\nIn another beautiful experiment, Kato et al. measure\nthrough Farraday Rotation (FR) a nonzero uniform magnetization \u03c1el induced by driving an electric current (electric field) through the sample E of their previous experiment [1]. It has been long predicted [9, 10] that semiconductors with spin-orbit coupling will exhibit a uniform\nmagnetization when placed in an electric field generating\na charge current. This can be trivially understood by a\nsimple argument: writing the spin-orbit Hamiltonian as\na ~k dependent magnetic field Zeeman coupled to spin,\n~ int (k)~\u03c3 (k), the application of an electric field E\n~ will\nB\nmake the average value of the momentum be non-zero\n\n\f5\ne ~\n< ~k >= m\nE\u03c4 where \u03c4 is the momentum relaxation time.\n~k >)\n~ int >= B(<\n~\nThis creates a non-zero average < B\nwhich orients the spins along its direction through the\nZeeman-like coupling of the spin-orbit term.\nWe now try to numerically estimate the value of the\nuniform magnetization \u03c1el using the BIA-type H3 . From\n[2], the BIA contribution to the uniform magnetization\n~\nE||[1\n1\u03040]\n\n~\nE||[110]\n\n\u2212 \u03c1el\n) and is\ncan be obtained as \u03c1BIA\n= 21 (\u03c1el\nel\n18 \u22123\naround 3\u00d710 m for E = 104 V /m. We will now try to\nestimate this from first principles using H3 as the main\nBIA term and using the value of D for sample E deduced\nin Table[I]. A simple linear response calculation of the\nmagnetization \u03c3i to the electric current Jj (due to the\napplied electric field Ej ) gives:\n\n2\u03c0e\u03c4\nQij Ej\n~\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ\n\u2202Bi\n\u2202B\nd3 k nE\u2212 \u2212 nE+\n\u2212B\nBi\nQij = hT \u03c3i Jj i =\n(2\u03c0)3\nB2\n\u2202kj\n\u2202kj\n(5)\n\u03c1iel =\n\nof the\nwhere i, j = x, y, z and Bi (k) are the components\nqP\ninternal magnetic field for H3 , B =\ni=x,y,z Bi Bi ,\nnE\u00b1 is the Fermi function of the spin-split energies E\u00b1 =\n~2 2\n2m k \u00b1 B for H3 .

The\nspin current will accumulate at the edges over a spin diffusion length of more than 500nm thus making its detection\npractical with a beam slightly more focused than in [2]. The\nuniform magnetization and the spin current spin accumulatio\nare \u03c0/2 out of phase.\n\nlinear response, the expression for the spin conductance\nis:\n\nl\nEj\nJil = \u03c3ij\n\n(6)\n\nAs previously pointed out the magnetization is paral~\n~\nlel to the electric field for E||x\u0302\nor E||\u0177.\nThis provides\nan important and easy check of the above assumption\nthat the observed strain spin splitting comes from H3 .\nThe only two directions where \u03c1\n~el is perpendicular to the\nelectric field are [110] and [11\u03040], the directions on which\nthe experiment is performed. Considering a sample of\nmobility \u03bc = 0.6m2 /V s [18] we obtain an estimate for\n\u03c1el = 3.45 \u00d7 1018 m\u22123 for a field E = 104 V /m, compared\nto an experimental value of 3 \u00d7 1018 m\u22123 for the same\nvalue of the electric field. The theoretical value obtained\nis within the experiment's error margins.\nFinally, using the current setup in [1, 2] we propose an\nexperiment to test the prediction of dissipationless spin\ncurrent. For spin 1/2 two-dimensional systems, the initial prediction [5] is subject to some sort of controversy,\n[14, 33, 34] as the introduction of impurities apparently\nmakes the spin current vanish. We here adopt the alternative view and propose a clear-cut experiment which\ncan see the spin accumulation due to the spin current.\nSimilar to the 2D case, in the present case, the application of an electric field Ej to a semiconductor with\nspin orbit coupling will create a spin current Sli flowing\nperpendicular to the electric field and polarized perpendicular to both the field and the direction of flow.

When both bands\nare occupied (positive Fermi energy), we find k\u2212 \u2212 k+ =\n2m \u03bb(k)\n~2 k , \u03bb(k) = D(\u01ebzz \u2212 \u01ebxx )k sin \u03b8. Usually the spin\nsplitting is much smaller than the Fermi energy, and we\ncan define an average Fermi momentum kF = 12 (k\u2212 +\nk+ ) \u2248 (3\u03c0 2 n)1/3 , n being the dopant density. With this,\nwe find that the spin-conductivity will be independent of\nthe value of the strain:\ne kf\n3\n3\n(9)\n\u03c321\n= \u2212\u03c312\n=\n~ 4\u03c0 2\n\n\f6\nThe result for the spin conductance is intermediate between the 2D spin 1/2 spin current and the 3D spin 3/2\nspin current. Similar to [4] but unlike [5] the spin conductance depends on the fermi momentum, a characteristic\nof the 3D. Unlike [4], but similar to [5], the spin conductance does not depend on the strength of spin-orbit\ncoupling. Even though the spin conductance does not depend on the value of strain, it is essential that spin-orbit\nsplitting (due to strain in this case) be present. Upon the\napplication of an electric field on the x axis, a spin current\nwill flow on the y axis spin polarized in the z direction.\nFor n = 1016 cm\u22123 , and a field E = 104 V /m we estik\nmate a spin current jspin = ~e 4\u03c0f2 E = 2 \u00d7 1021 (\u03bcB /cm2 s)\nwhere \u03bcB is a Bohr magneton. Since spin conductivity\n1\nvaries as n 3 and charge conductivity varies as n, for low\nvalues of n the spin conductance will overtake the charge\nconductance and the spin current will be larger than the\ncharge current caused by the electric field. The density\n2 1/3\n2e (6\u03c0 )\nat which this happens is n2/3 < ~\u03bc\n8\u03c0 2 , where \u03bc is\nthe mobility in the sample, or n < 2 \u00d7 1016 cm\u22123 for a\nsample of mobility \u03bc = 0.6m2 /V s.\nThe flow will result in accumulation on the opposite zx\nfaces of the crystal (see Fig[2]). For the present experiment, we estimate this spin accumulation of the order of\nJspin \u03c4S = 1013 \u03bcB /cm2 . Due to the extremely spin life\ntime of above 1ns, the distance from the edge of the sample, the spin diffusion length is very large, of the order\nL = 500nm\u22121\u03bcm. The FR beam used in [2] has a resolution of 4.7\u03bcm/9.7\u03bcm on the x and y axis respectively, but\nfocusing the beam within 1\u03bcm is possible [20, 35]. Then,\nif the spin current prediction is right, applying the FR\nbeam on the edge of the sample should give a clear signal (larger than the uniform magnetization in the bulk).\nSince the uniform magnetization and the spin accumulation due to spin hall current are perpendicular to each\nother, in time-resolved FR experiments, the spin current\nspin accumulation and the uniform magnetization are out\nof phase by \u03c0/2 (see Fig[2)\nIn conclusion, we have analyzed two very recent experiments [1, 2] and proved that conventional spin splitting\nterms and strain spin splitting terms do not explain the\ndata. We have introduced a previously largely unknown\nterm and made the case as to why it explains the observed\nfeatures in [1, 2]. We have proposed further simple experiments to verify our assertions. If true, our proposal gives\nrise to the clear possibility of obtaining a uniform magnetization parallel to the applied electric field, as opposed\nto the one perpendicular to it that has been observed so\nfar. Along with predicting a 3D spin current, we have\nalso proposed a way to test the spin currents in spin 1/2\nsystems.\nBAB wishes to primarily thank Y.
