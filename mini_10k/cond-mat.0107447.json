This system is closed related with\nthe phase transition between plateaus in the quantum Hall states and quasiexcitations\nin the d-wave supercondctor[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. However it is still controversial if\nthere exist extended states at the band center. In the previous paper[9], we studied\nthe case of non-Abelian U(Nc ) random vector potential for large Nc . There both\nweak and strong disorder cases are investigated separately by using lattice supersymmetry(LSUSY) which was originally invented for the study on the SUSY gauge\ntheory. Especially it was shown that correlation function of the fermion local density of states(DoS) decays algebraically at the band center. This result indicates the\nexistence of extended states there.\nThe above random Dirac fermion system on the lattice is closely related with\nthe lattice QCD for which there exist many useful and definite studies by numerical\nsimulations. Among them, one of the most interesting studies shows that the phase\nstructure of lattice QCD changes drastically depending on the number of flavors of\nquarks[10]. For small number of flavors, quarks are confined and the chiral symmetry\nis spontaneously broken, whereas as the number of flavors is increased, quarks are\ndeconfined and the chiral symmetry is restored. Then mass of \"pions\" is nonvanishing\neven for the vanishing bare quark mass for many flavors.\nThe above result of multi-flavor lattice QCD holds even at the strong-coupling\nlimit which directly corresponds to the strong-disorder limit in the random Dirac\nfermions. In the previous study on the Dirac fermions in a random U(Nc ) vector\npotential[9], we implicitly assumed a small number of fermion flavors. In this paper\nwe shall reexamine the system of multi-flavor or multi-species Dirac fermions. The\nflavor degrees of freedom is sometimes introduced in the replica tricks and one takes\nthe limit Nf (=the number of flavors) \u2192 0 after calculation. However in the present\nstudy, Nf is kept finite and moreover we even consider the case like Nf /Nc > 1. In\n2\n\n\fthe above lattice QCD, Nc = 3 and the critical value of Nf is 7.\nPlan of the present paper is as follows. In Sec.2, we shall study the strongcoupling limit of lattice QCD by deriving an effective action of U(Nc ) invariant\nexcitations, which is a kind of antiferromagnetic spin model. From this effective\naction, we can study the vacuum structure, especially how the chiral symmetry is\nrealized. For a small number of flavors, the chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken and (quasi)massless pions appear as a Nambu-Goldstone boson as we showed\npreviously[11]. For a large number of flavors, on the other hand, we show that the\nchiral symmetry is restored and \"pions\" become massive even at the chiral-invariant\nlimit. This result is of course in greement with the numerical studies[10]. In Sec.3,\nwe review the lattice model of the Dirac fermions in a U(Nc ) random vector potential. Especially we explain the LSUSY which is introduced in order to take ensemble\naverage over the random vector potential. Then we shall derive an effective action\nby using similar techniques used for QCD. From the discussion on QCD in Sec.2, we\nshow that there is a phase transition as the number of flavors is increased. This phase\ntransition can be observed from the correlator of the fermion local DoS. Section 4 is\ndevoted to conclusion.\n\n2\n\nQCD with many flavors and chiral symmetry\nrestoration\n\nBefore going into detailes of the Dirac fermions in a random vector potential, we\nshall investigate the strong-coupling limit of the lattice QCD. We follow the disussion in Ref.[11] which is also applicable for the random fermion system rather\nstraightforwardly[9].\nWe consider d-dimensional hypercubic lattice. Action of the QCD at the strong-\n\n3\n\n\fcoupling limit is given by\nSQCD =\n\ni\n1 Xh\n\u03c8\u0304(x)\u03b3\u03bc U\u03bc (x)\u03c8(x + \u03bc) \u2212 \u03c8\u0304(x + \u03bc)\u03b3\u03bc U\u03bc\u2020 (x)\u03c8(x) ,\n2\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere x = (x0 , .., xd\u22121 ) denotes lattice site, \u03bc = (0, ..., d \u2212 1) is the direction index,\n\u0010\n\nU\u03bc (x) is U(Nc ) field on the link (x, x + \u03bc) U\u03bc (x) = U\u03bc (x)\n\n\u0011a\nb\n\n\u2208 U(Nc ) and we set the\n\nlattice spacing aL = 1. The Dirac fermion \u03c8 carries not only the spinor and color\nindices s = 1, ..., 2[d/2] , a = 1, ..., Nc but also flavor index I = 1, ..., Nf , i.e., \u03c8 = \u03c8sa,I .\nIn Eq.(2.1), \u03b3\u03bc is the \u03b3-matrices which work on the spinor index of \u03c8. We add the\nfollowing quark mass term in the action\nSM = \u2212MB\n\nX\n\n\u03c8\u0304(x)\u03c8(x),\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhere MB is the quark bare mass. The gauge field action is vanishing because we\nare considering the strong-coupling limit. In the numerical studies[10], the Wilson\nfermion is used for defining definite number of flavor. Here we consider the naive\nlattice fermion. However it is quite plausible that a similar phase transition occurs\nas \"the number of flavor\" Nf is varied.\nIt is well-known that SQCD in (2.1) can be rewritten more compact form by the\nfollowing change of variables,\n\u03c8(x) = T (x)\u03c7(x), \u03c8\u0304(x) = \u03c7\u0304(x)T \u2020 (x),\n\n(2.3)\n\nwith T (x) = (\u03b30 )x0 * * * (\u03b3d\u22121 )xd\u22121 and using the identities like (\u03b3\u03bc )2 = 1 and (\u03b30 )n \u03b31 =\n(\u2212)n \u03b31 (\u03b30 )n (n is an integer), etc,\ni\n1 Xh\n\u03c7\u0304(x)\u03b7\u03bc (x)U\u03bc (x)\u03c7(x + \u03bc) \u2212 \u03c7\u0304(x + \u03bc)\u03b7\u03bc (x)U\u03bc\u2020 (x)\u03c7(x)\n2\nX\n=\n\u03c7\u0304(x)D\u0302\u03c7(x),\n\nSQCD =\n\n(2.4)\n\nwhere \u03b70 (x) = 1, \u03b71 (x) = (\u2212)x0 , \u03b72 (x) = (\u2212)x0 +x1 , * * *, and\nD\u0302\u03c7(x) =\n\ni\n1 Xh\n\u03b7\u03bc (x)U\u03bc (x)\u03c7(x + \u03bc) \u2212 \u03b7\u03bc (x \u2212 \u03bc)U\u03bc\u2020 (x \u2212 \u03bc)\u03c7(x \u2212 \u03bc) .\n2 \u03bc\n\n4\n\n(2.5)\n\n\fSimilarly\nSM = \u2212MB\n\nX\n\n\u03c7\u0304(x)\u03c7(x).\n\n(2.6)\n\nIn Eqs.(2.4) and (2.6), the spinor indices of \u03c7 and \u03c7\u0304 are diagonal and they play the\nsame role as the flavor index.\nPartition function of the system is given by\nZQCD =\nwhere [DU] =\n\nQ\n\nlink\n\nZ\n\n[DUD \u03c7\u0304D\u03c7]eSQCD +SM ,\n\n(2.7)\n\ndU\u03bc (x) is the Haar measure of U(Nc ). In Eq.(2.7), the integral\n\nover the gauge field U\u03bc (x) can be performed by the 1/Nc expansion because it reduces\nto the one-link integral in the strong-gauge-coupling limit[11]. There are two \"phases\"\nin the one-link integral[12]. The present case corresponds to the \"strong-coupling\nregime\". Detailes of the calculation can be seen in Ref.[9, 11] and here we simply give\nthe final expression. To this end, we define the following color singlet quark bilinear\noperators,\nm\u03b1\u03b2 (x) =\n\n1 X a,\u03b1\n\u03c7 (x)\u03c7\u0304a,\u03b2 (x),\nNc a\n\n(2.8)\n\nwhere \u03b1 and \u03b2 are flavor-spinor indices which take Nf s = Nf \u00d7 2[d/2] values. It is\nobvious that after integral over U\u03bc (x), the partition function ZQCD is expressed in\nterms of m\u03b1\u03b2 (x),\nZQCD (J) =\n\nZ\n\n[D \u03c7\u0304D\u03c7]eSm (\u03bb)+SM +J*m,\n\nwhere J's are source fields and J * m = Tr(Jm) =\n1/Nc 1\n\nwith\n\nP\n\n(2.9)\n\nJ\u03b2\u03b1 m\u03b2\u03b1 .

In this case, the chiral symmetry\nis spontaneously broken and \u03c0K (x)'s are quasi-Nambu-Goldstone bosons[11].\nWhat happends for Nc /Nf s \u226a 1. Numerical studies indicate that the \"pions\"\nbecome massive even in the limit MB \u2192 0. This means that chiral symmetry is\nrestored in this case. Actually this is not so difficult to see this behavior in manyflavor case from Sef f . The effective action (2.12) can be regarded as a system of\nU(Nf s ) antiferromagnets.3 One can expect that as degrees of freedom of the U(Nf s )\nspin, i.e., V\u03b2\u03b1 in the present system, becomes large, the long-range order is destroyed\nby fluctuations. For example in spatial 2 dimensions, ordered phase exists in the Ising\nmodel whereas there is no ordered phase in the O(3) spin model. Therefore we can\nnaturally expect that the chiral symmetry is restored for Nf s /Nc \u226b 1. Without the\nspontaneours breaking of the chiral symmetry, the expansion (2.17), which assumes\nsmall fluctuation of \u03c0K (x), is not justified.\nLet us see the above chiral phase transition more closely. To this end, we shall\nintroduce a more tractable model which is expected to belong to the same universality\nclass of Sef f . Let us notice that as MB \u2192 0, Sef f (M) is a sum of the one-link term\nlike\nh\n\nSlink = Nc Tr g(\u03bb\u0302\u03bc(x)) \u2212\n3\n\ni\n1\nln \u03bb\u0302\u03bc (x) .\n2d\n\n(2.19)\n\nMore direct relationship between the lattice QCD at strong coupling and antiferromagnets can\n\nbe seen in the Hamiltonian formalism[13].\n\n7\n\n\fThen we consider the following model which consists of a similar one-link term,\nSV =\n1\ng0\n\nwhere the parameter\n\ni\n1 X h \u2020\nTr V (x)V (x + \u03bc) + H.c. ,\ng0 x,\u03bc\n\n(2.20)\n\n\u223c Nc v 2 . Actually (a continuum version of) the action\n\nSV is derived directly from the QCD action (2.1) by using Zirnbauer's color-flavor\ntransformation[14](see also Ref.[15]), and therefore it is quite plausible that Sef f and\nSV belong to the same universality class.\nThe system SV (2.20) can be easily studied by the mean-field theory(MFT). To\nthis end, let us assume the expectation value of the field V (x) \u2208 U(Nf s ) as\nhV\u03b2\u03b1 (x)i = w \u03b4\u03b2\u03b1 ,\n\n(2.21)\n\nwhere we have used the U(Nf s ) symmetry and we assume that w is real.4 We employ\nthe following one-site action as MF action[16],\nSM F =\n\ni\n1\nw h\nTr V + V \u2020 \u2212 Nf s w 2 ,\ng0\ng0\n\n(2.22)\n\nand the partition function of the MFT is given by\nZM F = e\u2212VM F (w)\nZ\n\n=\n\ndV eSM F .\n\n(2.23)\n\nFrom Eqs.(2.22) and (2.23), it is obvious that the stationary condition of VM F (w)\ngives the \"gap\" equation which determines the expectation value w.\nThe integral over V in (2.23) with the U(Nf s ) Haar measure can be performed by\nthe same techniques used before for integrating over the gauge field U\u03bc (x),\nVM F (w) = \u2212Nf s g\n\n\u0010\n\n4 w 2 \u0011 Nf s 2\n( ) +\nw .\nNf s g0\ng0\n\n(2.24)\n\nEspecially for small w,\nw\nVM F (w) = \u2212\ng0\n4\n\n!2\n\n+\n\nNf s 2\nw + O(w 4).\ng0\n\n(2.25)\n\nPlease do not confuse w with v. In the terminology of the spin model, v is the magnitude of\n\nspin, whereas w is the magnetization. Therefore nonvanishing w means the long-range order.\n\n8\n\n\fFrom Eqs.(2.24) and (2.25), it is obvious that for Nf s >\n1\ng0\n\nminimum, whereas for Nf s <\n\n1\ng0\n\n= Nc v 2 , w = 0 is the stable\n\n= Nc v 2 , w = 0 becomes unstable and w has a finite\n\nvalue at the minimum of VM F . Then this simple consideration using SV and the MFT\nsupports our expectation, i.e., for Nf s /Nc \u226a 1 the vacuum is chiral symmetric and\nthere are no Nambu-Goldstone bosons, whereas for Nc /Nf s \u226a 1 the chiral symmetry\nis spontaneously broken and gapless excitations exist.\nIn the chiral-symmetric case, physical quantities are calculated by using the U(Nf s )\nHaar measure for V (x). We are interested in the meson-meson correlation functions\nlike hM\u03b1\u03b2 (x)M\u03b3\u03c9 (0)i. The integral over V (x) can be performed by using the characterexpansion for V (x)V \u2020 (x + \u03bc) \u2208 U(Nf s )[17], and each link term of the action can be\nwritten as;\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nexp Slink =\n\nX\n\nF\u03c1 (Nc , v)\u03c7\u03c1 (V \u2020 (x)V (x + \u03bc)),\n\n(2.26)\n\n\u03c1\n\nwhere \u03c1 refers to irreducible representations of U(Nf s ), \u03c7\u03c1 is the character and\nF\u03c1 (Nc , v) is a function of Nc and v.\nIntegral over V \u2208 U(Nf s ) can be performed by the following formula[17],\nZ\n\ndV V\u03b2\u2020\u03b1 V\u03c9\u03b3 =\n\n1 \u03b1 \u03b3\n\u03b4 \u03b4 .\nNf s \u03c9 \u03b2\n\n(2.27)\n\nFrom Eqs.(2.26) and (2.27), the meson correlation function is calculated for the simplest case, i.e., one-dimensional system with free boundary condition. In this case the\nV \u2020 V correlator is obtained as follows;\nhV\u03b2\u2020\u03b1 (x)V\u03c9\u03b3 (0)i\n\n\u223c\n\nFf (Nc , v)\nNf s F0 (Nc , v)\n\n= e\u2212m\u03c0 |x| \u03b4\u03c9\u03b1 \u03b4\u03b2\u03b3 ,\n\n!|x|\n\n\u03b4\u03c9\u03b1 \u03b4\u03b2\u03b3\n(2.28)\n\nwhere f and 0 refer to the fundamental and trivial representations of U(Nf s ), respectively, and m\u03c0 = ln(Nf s F0 /Ff ). As the dimension of the group U(Nf s ) becomes\nlarger, the mass m\u03c0 is getting larger as we expected.\nThe above considerations naturally explain the numerical calculations of the multiflavor QCD[10]. In the following section, we shall apply the above observation to the\n9\n\n\fDirac ferimons in a random vector potentail. We shall begin with reviewing the\nprevious studies using LSUSY[9].\n\n3\n\nLSUSY and localization\n\nLet us start with reviewing lattice formulation of random Dirac fermions. Our model\nis motivated by the network model for the quantum Hall phase transition in twodimensional electron systems in a strong magnetic field [19]. There electrons move\nalong equipotential line of the random impurity potential and acquire AharonovBohm phase from the strong magnetic field. Then we shall consider d = 2 case in\nthis section. Fermionic (electronic) part of the action is given as in the lattice QCD\nin the previous section;\nSD =\n\nX\n\n\u03c7\u0304(x)D\u0302\u03c7(x),\n\n(3.1)\n\nwhere \u03c7(x) and \u03c7\u0304(x) are two-component Grassmann fields with the color U(Nc ) and\nflavor U(Nf s ) indices as before. The bare mass MB in Sec.2 corresponds to the energy\nmeasured from the band center in the present electron system and we set MB = 0\nas we consider states at the band center. Corresponding to the Grassmann fields, we\nintroduce complex scalar fields \u03c6(x) and \u03c6\u2020 (x) with the color and flavor degrees of\nfreedom as follows[18],\nS\u03c6 =\n\nX\n\nD\u0302\u03c6\u2020 (x)D\u0302\u03c6(x).\n\n(3.2)\n\nIt can be shown that the system SD + S\u03c6 possesses LSUSY,\n\u03b4\u03c6 = \u01ed+ \u03c7\u2212 + \u01ed\u2212 \u03c7+ ,\n\u03b4\u03c6\u2020 = \u03c7\u0304\u2212 \u01eb+ + \u03c7\u0304+ \u01eb\u2212 ,\n\u03b4\u03c7\u00b1 = \u2212D\u0302\u03c6\u01eb\u00b1 ,\n\u03b4 \u03c7\u0304\u00b1 = \u2212D\u0302\u03c6\u2020 \u01ed\u00b1 ,\n\n(3.3)\n\nwhere \u03c7\u00b1 is the chiral decomposition, i.e., \u03b35 \u03c7\u00b1 = \u00b1\u03c7\u00b1 and \u01eb\u00b1 are anticommuting\nspinor variables with chirality \u03b35 \u01eb\u00b1 = \u00b1\u01eb\u00b1 . From the LSUSY (3.3), the partition\n10\n\n\ffunction is just unity, i.e., the determinant from the \u03c7 integral and that from \u03c6\nintegral cancell with each other[9]. Parameter g which controls randomness of the\nvector potential can be introduced as follows,\nP [U] =\n\nY\n\nhN\n\nc\n\nexp\n\ng\n\nx\n\ni\n\ntr(U\u03bc (x) + U\u03bc\u2020 (x)) .\n\n(3.4)\n\nEnsemble average with respect to the random vector potential for calculating correlators etc can be performed readily by the LSUSY[9];\nhOi =\n\nZ\n\n[DUD \u03c7\u0304D\u03c7D\u03c6\u2020 D\u03c6]P [U]e\u2212SD \u2212S\u03c6 O\n\ne\u2212SD\nO\n[det(D\u0302 \u2020 D\u0302)]\nZ\ne\u2212SD\n=\n[DUD \u03c7\u0304D\u03c7]P [U]\nO,\nh\u03c7; U|\u03c7; Ui\n=\n\nZ\n\n[DUD \u03c7\u0304D\u03c7]P [U]\n\n(3.5)\n\nwhere O is physical observable of the Dirac fermion and |\u03c7; Ui is the lowest-energy\nstate of \u03c7(x) in the background of U\u03bc (x). From Eq.(3.5), the utility of the LSUSY is\nobvious. In the rest of the discussion, we consider the strong-disorder limit g \u2192 \u221e\nand therefore there is no distribution weight for the gauge field U\u03bc (x) as in the strongcoupling limit of QCD.\nThe bosonic action S\u03c6 can be rewritten into more compact form[18, 9],\nS\u03c6 \u21d2 S\u03c9\u03c6 =\n\nXh\n\ni\n\n\u03c9 \u2020 D\u0302\u03c6 + \u03c6\u2020 D\u0302\u03c9 ,\n\n(3.6)\n\nwhere \u03c9 and \u03c6 are complex boson fields. Then the one-link integral of U\u03bc (x) in\nthe previous section can be applied straightforwardly. Fermion-fermion(FF) sector is\ngiven by Sm (\u03bb) in Eq.(2.10). Boson-boson(BB) sector is also written in terms of the\nfollowing composite fields like\n\n1\nNc\n\nP\n\na\n\n\u03c6a,\u03b1 (x)\u03c6\u2020a,\u03b2 (x),\n\n1\nNc\n\nP\n\na\n\n\u2020\n\u03c9 a,\u03b1 (x)\u03c9a,\u03b2\n(x), etc., but\n\nthe sign of the action is just opposite to the FF sector. There are additional terms\nwhich include fermionic composites like \u03c7a (x)\u03c6\u2020a (x) but they contributions to the FF\nand BB sectors are negligible in the leading order of 1/Nc .\nFrom the above arguments and investigation on QCD in Sec.2, it is straightforward\nto discuss physical properties of the random Dirac fields at the band center which\n11\n\n\fcorresponds to the vanishing bare mass MB \u2192 0. We are interested in the correlation\nfunction of the local fermion DoS m\u03c8 (x) =\n\nP\n\na\n\n\u03c8\u0304a (x)\u03c8 a (x), which is nothing but\n\nthe \"pion\" field in QCD. Therefore in the case of a small number of flavors, one\nexpects that the operator m\u03c8 (x) condenses and has a nonvanishing expectation value.\nHowever as we are studying the 2-dimensional system, the genuine long-range order\ndoes not exist and the correlator of m\u03c8 (x) decays algebraically (quasi-long-range\norder) instead [9];5\nh\u03c8\u0304\u03c8(x)\u03c8\u0304\u03c8(0)i \u223c |x|\u22121/Nc .\n\n(3.7)\n\nThe power-decaying behavior in (3.7) comes from the fluctuation of the \"pions\" \u03c0K (x).\nIt should be remarked here that in the present lattice formulation topologically nontrivial configurations of the random vector potential are all included. This formulation\nis motivated by the network model by Chalker and Coddington[19] and it is in contrast to other formulations like that using the conformal field theory. Therefore it is\nnot so surprising even if the decay power of the correlator (3.7) is different from that\nobtained in other methods[8]. The power-decay behaviour (3.7) means the existence\nof the extended states anyway.\nLet us turn to the many flavors case. The discussion in Sec.2 can be applied\nstraightforwardly to the random system in this section. As the system is 2-dimensinal,\nthe disordered phase is enhanced in the U(Nf s ) antiferromagnets. The correlator of\nthe local fermion DoS behaves as\nh\u03c8\u0304\u03c8(x)\u03c8\u0304\u03c8(0)i \u223c e\u2212Ml |x| ,\n\n(3.8)\n\nthough we cannot estimate the \"inverse localization length\" Ml analytically. The\nabove is a new and main result in this paper which indicates that extended states at\nthe band center disappear as the number of flavors is increased.\nRecently certain related model is studied in Ref.[20], and a similar phase transition\nis predicted, though the model is defined in the continuum space instead of on the\n5\n\nHere we do not show explicitly the flavor-spinor indices as they are obvious as in (2.28).\n\n12\n\n\flattice. In the present lattice model, which is motivated by the network model for the\nquantum Hall transition, topological nontrivial configurations of the gauge field are\nincluded. Therefore it is quite nontrivial that a similar transition or crossover occurs\nin the both cases.\n\n4\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this paper we studied Dirac fermions in the random U(Nc ) vector potential by\nusing lattice formulation. Especially we showed that physical properties at the band\ncenter drastically change as the number of flavors is increased. For a small number\nof flavors, the correlator of the local fermion DoS exhibits algebraic decay, whereas\nfor many flavors, it decays exponentially. This result suggests that extended states\nat the band center disappear as Nf \u2192large. Numerical studies of QCD with many\nflavors[10] supports this result.\nThe above result is quite interesting and it is desired to study the same problem by\nother methods. Recently a closely related model, the random flux model, was studied\nby a lattice formulation[21]. There a mathematical tool invented by Zirnbauer[14]\nwas used and the DoS was calculated for the single-flavor case. Then it is interesting\nto calculate the DoS for many flavors and to see if qualitative difference appears as\nthe number of flavors is increased.\nIn the present studies we cannot estimate the critical value of Nf for the delocalizationlocalization transition(DLT). Closely related and tractable model is a quantum U(Nf )\nantiferrmagnetic Heisenberg model[22]. There a phase transition, which corresponds\nto the DLT, is predicted and the critical value of Nf is estimated.\n\n13\n\n\fReferences\n[1] A.W.W.Ludwig, M.P.A.Fisher, R.Shanker and G.Grinstein,\nPhys.Rev.B50(1994)7526.\n[2] A.A.Nersesyan, A.M.Tsvelik and F.Wenger, Phys.Rev.Lett.72(1994)2628;\nNucl.Phys.B438(1995)561.\n[3] I.Kogan, C.Mudry and A.M.Tsvelik, Phys.Rev.Lett.77(1996)707.\n[4] C. de C.Chamon, C.Mudry and X-G.Wen, Phys.Rev.Lett.77(1996)4194.\n[5] C. de C.Chamon, C.Mudry and X-G.Wen, Phy.Rev.B53(1996)R7638.\n[6] H.E.Castillo, C. de C.Chamon, E.Fradkin, P.M.Goldbart and C.Mudry,\nPhys.Rev.B56(1997)10668.\n[7] J.S.Caux, N.Taniguchi and A.M.Tsvelik, Phy.Rev.Lett.80(1998)1276;\nNucl.Phys.B525(1998)671.\n[8] M.J.
