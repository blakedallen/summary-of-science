We define a Hamilton\u2013Jacobi semigroup acting on continuous functions on a\ncompact length space. Following a strategy of Bobkov, Gentil and Ledoux, we use some\nbasic properties of the semigroup to study geometric inequalities related to concentration\nof measure. Our main results are that (1) a Talagrand inequality on a measured length\nspace implies a global Poincar\u00e9 inequality and (2) if the space satisfies a doubling condition,\na local Poincar\u00e9 inequality and a log Sobolev inequality then it also satisfies a Talagrand\ninequality.\n\nLinks between concentration of measure, log Sobolev inequalities, Talagrand inequalities\nand Poincar\u00e9 inequalities have been studied in the setting of Riemannian manifolds [1, 2, 3,\n8, 9, 12]. The main result in the paper of Otto and Villani [12] can be informally stated as\nfollows: on a Riemannian manifold, a log Sobolev inequality implies a Talagrand inequality,\nwhich in turn implies a Poincar\u00e9 (or spectral gap) inequality, all of this being without any\ndegradation of the constants.\nOn the other hand, there has been intense recent activity to develop a theory of Ricci\ncurvature bounds, log Sobolev inequalities and related inequalities in the more general\nsetting of metric-measure length spaces satisfying minimal regularity assumptions [10, 11,\n14, 15, 16].\nThe goal of the present paper is to extend the main results of [12] to this generalized\nframework, which can be considered to be a natural degree of regularity for the problem. To\ndo so, we adapt the strategy of Bobkov-Gentil-Ledoux [2], based on the Hamilton\u2013Jacobi\nsemigroup. We also establish the basic properties of the Hamilton\u2013Jacobi semigroup for\ngeneral length spaces, which is of independent interest.\n1. Main results\nBasic information on length spaces is in [4, Chapter 2]. For the sake of simplicity we\nwork with compact length spaces, but the results remain valid for locally compact complete\nseparable length spaces.\nThroughout this paper, X will denote a compact length space, equipped with a metric\nd and a Borel reference probability measure \u03bd. We use the following conventions:\n- Lip(X) denotes the set of real-valued Lipschitz functions on X.\nDate: March 28, 2007.\nThe research of the first author was supported by NSF grant DMS-0604829.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nJOHN LOTT AND C\u00c9DRIC VILLANI\n\n- Given f \u2208 C(X), we define the gradient norm of f at a point x \u2208 X by\n(1.1)\n\n|\u2207f |(x) = lim sup\ny\u2192x\n\n|f (y) \u2212 f (x)|\n.\nd(x, y)\n\nIf f \u2208 Lip(X) then |\u2207f | \u2208 L\u221e (X).\n- We further define the subgradient norm of f at x by\n(1.2)\n\n|\u2207\u2212 f |(x) = lim sup\ny\u2192x\n\n[f (x) \u2212 f (y)]+\n[f (y) \u2212 f (x)]\u2212\n= lim sup\n.\nd(x, y)\nd(x, y)\ny\u2192x\n\nHere a+ = max(a, 0) and a\u2212 = max(\u2212a, 0). Clearly |\u2207\u2212 f |(x) \u2264 |\u2207f |(x), so the\nsubgradient norm is a (slightly) finer notion than the gradient norm. Note that |\u2207\u2212 f |(x)\nis automatically zero if f has a local minimum at x. In a sense, |\u2207\u2212 f |(x) measures the\ndownward pointing component of f near x.\n- Given two probability measures \u03bc0 and \u03bc1 on X, the Wasserstein distance (of order 2)\nW2 (\u03bc0 , \u03bc1) between \u03bc0 and \u03bc1 is the square root of the optimal transport cost between\n\u03bc0 and \u03bc1 , when the infinitesimal cost is the square of the distance; see for instance [17,\nTheorem 7.3].\n- The metric-measure space (X, d, \u03bd) satisfies a doubling condition if the measure \u03bd is\ndoubling in the sense of [6, eq. (0.1)].\n- The metric-measure space (X, d, \u03bd) satisfies a local Poincar\u00e9 inequality if the measure\n\u03bd satisfies the weak Poincar\u00e9 inequality of type (1,1) as in [6, eq. (4.3)].\n- The metric-measure space (X, d, \u03bd) is nonbranching if any two constant-speed geodesics\n[0, 1] \u2192 X that coincide on an interval (t0 , t1 ) \u2282 [0, 1] are equal.\nWe will focus on the following three functional inequalities:\n\u2022 If K > 0, we say that (X, d, \u03bd)\na log Sobolev inequality with constant K,\nR satisfies\n2\nLSI(K), if for any f \u2208 Lip(X) with X f d\u03bd = 1 we have\nZ\nZ\n2\n2\n2\n(1.3)\nf log(f ) d\u03bd \u2264\n|\u2207\u2212 f |2 d\u03bd.\nK\nX\nX\n\u2022 We say that (X, d,R\u03bd) satisfies a Talagrand inequality with constant K, T (K), if for\nany F \u2208 L2 (X, \u03bd) with X F 2 d\u03bd = 1, we have\ns R\n2 X F 2 log(F 2 ) d\u03bd\n.\n(1.4)\nW2 (F 2 \u03bd, \u03bd) \u2264\nK\n\u2022 We say that (X, d, \u03bd) satisfies\na (global) Poincar\u00e9 inequality with constant K, P (K),\nR\nif for any h \u2208 Lip(X) with X h d\u03bd = 0, we have\nZ\nZ\n1\n2\n|\u2207\u2212 h|2 d\u03bd.\n(1.5)\nh d\u03bd \u2264\nK\nX\nX\n\n\fTHE HAMILTON\u2013JACOBI SEMIGROUP ON LENGTH SPACES AND APPLICATIONS\n\n3\n\nRemark 1.6. In (1.3) and (1.5) we use the subgradient norm defined in (1.2), instead of\nthe gradient norm defined in (1.1). Accordingly, our log Sobolev and Poincar\u00e9 inequalities\nare slightly stronger statements than those discussed by many other authors.\nInequalities (1.3), (1.4) and (1.5) are associated with concentration of measure [1, 2, 3,\n8, 9, 18]. For example, T (K) implies a Gaussian-type concentration of measure.\nThe following chain of implications, none of which is an equivalence, is well-known in\nthe context of smooth Riemannian manifolds :\n(1.7)\n\n[Ric \u2265 K] =\u21d2 LSI(K) =\u21d2 T (K) =\u21d2 P (K).\n\nA complete proof of (1.7) is available for instance in [18, Chapters 21 and 22].\nOur main result is as follows:\nTheorem 1.8. Let (X, d, \u03bd) be a compact measured length space.\n(i) If (X, d, \u03bd) satisfies T (K), for some K > 0, then it also satisfies P (K).\n(ii) Suppose that (X, d, \u03bd) satisfies a doubling condition on the measure and a local\nPoincar\u00e9 inequality. If (X, d, \u03bd) satisfies LSI(K) for some K > 0, then it also satisfies\nT (K).\nIt is standard that LSI(K) implies P (K); see, for example, [10, Theorem 6.18].\nThe assumptions of Theorem 1.8(ii) are satisfied if (X, d, \u03bd) is nonbranching and has\nRicci curvature bounded below in the sense of Lott\u2013Villani and Sturm [11, 14, 16]. They\nare also satisfied if (X, d) is a length space with Alexandrov curvature bounded below and\nHausdorff dimension n < \u221e, and \u03bd is the n-dimensional Hausdorff measure on X; the\ndoubling property follows from the Bishop\u2013Gromov inequality [4, Theorem 10.6.6] and the\nlocal Poincar\u00e9 inequality was proven in [7, Theorem 7.2].\nTheorem 1.8 will be proven in Section 3. An important technical tool in the proof is the\nquadratic Hamilton\u2013Jacobi semigroup, which will be introduced and studied in Section 2.\nWe thank Juha Heinonen for some helpful comments.\n2. Hamilton\u2013Jacobi semigroup\nFirst, we recall the Hamilton-Jacobi semigroup in the case of Riemannian manifolds. If\nM is a compact Riemannian manifold, then the quadratic Hamilton\u2013Jacobi equation on\nM is\n\u2202F\n|\u2207F |2\n(2.1)\n+\n= 0.\n\u2202t\n2\nGiven an initial condition f \u2208 C(M), the viscosity solution to the Hamilton\u2013Jacobi equation is given by the Hopf\u2013Lax formula\n\u0014\n\u0015\nd(x, y)2\n(2.2)\nF (t, x) = inf f (y) +\n,\ny\u2208X\n2t\n\nwhere d is the geodesic distance on M. The map that sends f to F (t, *) defines a semigroup\naction of R+ on C(M), called the Hamilton\u2013Jacobi semigroup.\n\n\f4\n\nJOHN LOTT AND C\u00c9DRIC VILLANI\n\nEquation (2.2) does not require any smoothness assumption, so the following definition\nmakes sense.\nDefinition 2.3. Let (X, d) be a compact metric space. Given f \u2208 C(X) and t \u2265 0, we\ndefine a map Qt : X \u2192 R by\n\u0014\n\u0015\nd(x, y)2\n(2.4)\n(Qt f )(x) = inf f (y) +\n,\ny\u2208X\n2t\nwith the convention that Q0 f = f .\n\nIf X is a length space, then the map Qt defines a semigroup action of R+ on C(X); see\npart (i) of Theorem 2.5 below. We may then speak of the \"Hamilton\u2013Jacobi semigroup\".\nThe next theorem establishes some of its basic properties.\nTheorem 2.5. (i) For any s, t \u2265 0, Qt Qs f = Qt+s f .\n(ii) For any x \u2208 X, inf f \u2264 (Qt f )(x) \u2264 f (x).\n(iii) For any t > 0, Qt f \u2208 Lip(X).\n(iv) For any x \u2208 X, (Qt f )(x) is a nonincreasing function of t, that converges monotonically to f (x) as t \u2192 0. In particular, limt\u21920 Qt f = f in C(X).\n(v) For any t \u2265 0, s > 0 and x \u2208 X,\nkQt f k2Lip\n|Qt+s f (x) \u2212 Qt f (x)|\n\u2264\n.\ns\n2\n(vi) For any x \u2208 X and t \u2265 0,\n\n(2.6)\n\n|\u2207\u2212 Qt f |(x)2\n(Qt+s f )(x) \u2212 (Qt f )(x)\n\u2265\u2212\n.\ns\u21920\ns\n2\n(vii) If (X, d, \u03bd) satisfies a doubling condition on the measure and a local Poincar\u00e9 inequality, then for t > 0 and \u03bd-almost any x \u2208 X,\n(2.7)\n\nlim inf\n+\n\n(Qt+s f )(x) \u2212 (Qt f )(x)\n|\u2207\u2212 Qt f |2(x)\n=\u2212\n.\ns\u21920\ns\n2\n(viii) If (X, d) is a finite-dimensional space with Alexandrov curvature bounded below\nthen for any t > 0 and any x \u2208 X,\n\n(2.8)\n\nlim+\n\n(2.9)\n\nlim+\n\ns\u21920\n\n|\u2207\u2212 Qt f |2(x)\n(Qt+s f )(x) \u2212 (Qt f )(x)\n=\u2212\n.\ns\n2\n\nRemark 2.10. Part (vii) of Theorem 2.5 will be used in the proof of Theorem 1.8. Part\n(viii) is not needed for the proof of Theorem 1.8, but may be of independent interest.\nParts (vii) and (viii) show that for t > 0, the function F (t, x) = Qt f (x) satisfies the\nHamilton-Jacobi equation\n|\u2207\u2212 F |2\n\u2202F\n+\n= 0,\n\u2202t\n2\nalmost everywhere in the case of (vii) and everywhere in the case of (viii).\n(2.11)\n\n\fTHE HAMILTON\u2013JACOBI SEMIGROUP ON LENGTH SPACES AND APPLICATIONS\n\n5\n\nRemark 2.12. Theorem 2.5 is reminiscent of known properties of Hamilton\u2013Jacobi equations in a smooth setting; see e.g. [5]. However, even in the context of Riemannian manifolds, we have been unable to find exactly this statement in the literature. On the one\nhand, the vast majority of works are only concerned with Euclidean or Hilbert spaces. On\nthe other hand, the use of the subgradient norm is a bit nonstandard.\nRemark 2.13. More general Hamilton\u2013Jacobi semigroups will be considered in [18, Appendix of Chapter 22], of the form\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\nd(x, y)\nQt f (x) = inf f (y) + t L\n,\ny\u2208X\nt\n\nwhere L : R+ \u2192 R+ is increasing, convex and locally semiconcave, with L(0) = 0. Theorem 2.5 can be extended mutatis mutandis to this more general situation (apart maybe\nfrom (viii)). In this generalization, a few minor complications arise if L\u2032 (\u221e) < +\u221e. (For\nsimplicity, only Riemannian manifolds are considered in [18, Chapter 22], but nonsmooth\nspaces can be treated as in the present paper.) At the level of geometric applications, an\ninteresting case in relation to Poincar\u00e9 inequalities (as opposed to log Sobolev inequalities)\nis when L(s) is asymptotic to s2 for small s, and to s for large s.\nProof of Theorem 2.5. To prove (i), we first claim that for all x, y \u2208 X and s, t > 0,\n\u0014\n\u0015\nd(x, y)2\nd(x, z)2 d(z, y)2\n(2.14)\n.\n= inf\n+\nz\u2208X\nt+s\nt\ns\n\nThe triangle inequality implies that the left-hand side of (2.14) is less than or equal to the\nright-hand side. The equality in (2.14) comes from choosing a minimal geodesic between\nt\nx and y, and a point z on this geodesic with d(x, z) = s+t\nd(x, y).\nFrom (2.14), we obtain\n(2.15)\n\u0015\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0014\nd(x, z)2 d(z, y)2\nd(x, y)2\n= inf inf f (y) +\n= (Qt Qs f )(x),\n+\n(Qt+s f )(x) = inf f (y) +\ny\u2208X z\u2208X\ny\u2208X\n2(t + s)\n2t\n2s\nwhich proves (i).\nFor part (ii), the inequality on the left is obvious, while the inequality on the right follows\nfrom the choice y = x in the definition of (Qt f )(x).\nPart (iii) follows from\n1\n(Qt f )(x) \u2212 (Qt f )(x\u2032 ) \u2264 sup[d(x, y)2 \u2212 d(x\u2032 , y)2]\n(2.16)\n2t y\u2208X\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n\u2032\n\u2264\nsup[d(x, y) + d(x , y)] d(x, x\u2032 )\n2t y\u2208X\ndiam(X)\nd(x, x\u2032 ).\n\u2264\nt\nIn view of (i) and (ii), for any s, t > 0 and x \u2208 X,\n(2.17)\n\n(Qt+s f )(x) \u2264 (Qt f )(x),\n\n\f6\n\nJOHN LOTT AND C\u00c9DRIC VILLANI\n\nso (Qt f )(x) is indeed a nonincreasing function\n\u221a of t.

Since the convergence is monotone and X is\ncompact, the convergence is uniform. This proves part (iv) of the theorem.\nNext, for g \u2208 C(X), we write (with C = C(g) and the convention that 0 * \u221e = 0)\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1\nd(x, y)2\ng(x) \u2212 (Qs g)(x)\n=\nsup\ng(x) \u2212 g(y) \u2212\ns\ns y\u2208B\u221aCs (x)\n2s\n\u0013\n\u0012\n[g(x) \u2212 g(y)]+ d(x, y) d(x, y)2\n\u2212\n\u2264 sup\nd(x, y)\ns\n2s2\ny\u2208B\u221aCs (x)\n\u0012\n\u00132\n1 [g(x) \u2212 g(y)]+\n\u2264 sup\n.\nd(x, y)\ny\u2208B\u221aCs (x) 2\nIf g = Qt f , in view of (i) and (ii) this becomes\n(2.22)\n\nQt f (x) \u2212 (Qt+s f )(x)\n1\n0\u2264\n\u2264 sup\ns\ny\u2208B\u221aCs (x) 2\n\n\u0012\n\n[Qt f (x) \u2212 Qt f (y)]+\nd(x, y)\n\n\u00132\n\n.\n\nThen statement (v) follows immediately.

Again\nwith g = Qt f , we want to prove that\n\u0014\n\u0015\ng(x) \u2212 (Qs g)(x)\n|\u2207\u2212 g|2(x)\n(2.24)\nlim inf\n\u2265\n.\ns\u21920+\ns\n2\n\n\fTHE HAMILTON\u2013JACOBI SEMIGROUP ON LENGTH SPACES AND APPLICATIONS\n\n7\n\nThe case when |\u2207\u2212 g|(x) = 0 is obvious, since (Qt g)(x) is a nonincreasing function of t. So\nin what follows we assume that |\u2207\u2212 g|(x) > 0.\nWe write\n\u0015\n\u0014\ng(x) \u2212 (Qs g)(x)\n1\nd(x, y)2\n(2.25)\n= sup g(x) \u2212 g(y) \u2212\ns\ns y\u2208X\n2s\n\u0015\n\u0013\n\u0012\u0014\n|\u2207\u2212 g|2(x)\ng(x) \u2212 g(y)\n\u2212\n|\u2207 g|(x) \u2212\n.\n\u2265\nsup\nd(x, y)\n2\ny\u2208Ss|\u2207\u2212 g|(x) (x)\nPut\ng(x) \u2212 g(y)\n.\nd(x, y)\ny \u2208Sr (x)\n\n(2.26)\n\n\u03c8(r) = sup\n\nAs lim supr\u21920+ \u03c8(r) = |\u2207\u2212 g|(x) > 0, if we can show that lim inf r\u21920+ \u03c8(r) = |\u2207\u2212 g|(x)\nthen equation (2.25) will imply (2.24).\nFor (vii), we use results from [6]. By [6, Theorem 10.2], the Lipschitz function g admits\ngeneralized linear derivatives g0,x at x for \u03bd-almost all x \u2208 X. For such an x, suppose that\nthere is a sequence ri \u2192 0 such that limi\u21920 \u03c8(ri ) = |\u2207\u2212 g|(x) \u2212 \u01eb for some \u01eb > 0. After\npassing to a further subsequence, we can assume that the rescaled measured length spaces\n\u22121/2\n(X, x, ri d, \u03bd) converge to a measured tangent cone (Xx , x\u221e , d\u221e , \u03bd\u221e ) and the rescaled\n1/2\nfunctions gr1/2 ,x = (g \u2212 g(x))/ri converge to a generalized linear function g0,x on X\u221e ; see\ni\n\n1/2\n\n[6, Theorem 10.2]. (Note that we rescale by ri and not ri ; any rate si \u2192 0 such that\nri = o(si ) would do.) Then |\u2207\u2212 g0,x |(x\u221e ) = |\u2207\u2212 g|(x)\u2212\u01eb. From [6, Theorem 8.10], there is a\nunit-speed line \u03b3 in X\u221e through x\u221e which is an integral curve for g0,x . That is, \u03b3(0) = x\u221e\nand dtd g0,x (\u03b3(t)) = |\u2207g0,x |. It follows that |\u2207\u2212 g0,x |(x\u221e ) \u2265 |\u2207g0,x |(x\u221e ). However, from [6,\nTheorem 10.2], one has |\u2207g0,x |(x\u221e ) = |\u2207g|(x). Thus |\u2207g|(x) \u2264 |\u2207\u2212 g|(x) \u2212 \u01eb, which is a\ncontradiction. This proves statement (vii).\n\nRemark 2.27. This reasoning shows actually shows that |\u2207\u2212 g|(x) \u2265 |\u2207g|(x), so |\u2207\u2212 g|(x) =\n|\u2207g|(x) (for \u03bd-almost all x).\nStatement (viii), with convergence for all x \u2208 X, requires additional regularity for X.\nWe will use the notion of quasigeodesics in Alexandrov spaces, as studied in [13]. The following properties will be useful: (a) squared distance functions, when restricted to quasigeodesics, satisfy the same curvature-dependent differential inequalities as when restricted\nto geodesics (inequality (2.30) below); (b) quasigeodesics can be extended to all positive\ntimes; (c) uniform limits of quasigeodesics are quasigeodesics, and this statement goes\nthrough for quasigeodesics defined on a Gromov\u2013Hausdorff converging sequence of Alexandrov spaces. We recall that by definition, nontrivial quasi-geodesics are parametrized by\narc-length.\nLemma 2.28. Let X be a finite-dimensional compact length space with Alexandrov curvature bounded below. Fix x \u2208 X. Then\n(i) There is some \u03b4 > 0 so that each complete quasigeodesic \u03b3 : [0, \u221e) \u2192 X starting\nfrom x intersects S\u03b4 (x).\n\n\f8\n\nJOHN LOTT AND C\u00c9DRIC VILLANI\n\n(ii) There is a function \u03c3 : (0, \u03b4) \u2192 R+ with limr\u21920+ \u03c3(r) = 0 so that if \u03b3 : [0, L] \u2192 X\nis a quasigeodesic segment starting from x with \u03b3(L) \u2208 Sr (x) and \u03b3([0, L]) \u2282 Br (x) then\nL\n\u2212 1 \u2264 \u03c3(r).\nr\nRemark 2.29. Of course, if X is a Riemannian manifold then this lemma holds true for\ngeodesics. (Take \u03b4 to be the injectivity radius at x and take \u03c3 = 0.)\nProof of Lemma 2.28. Suppose that (i) is not true. Then for each i \u2208 Z+ , there is a\nquasigeodesic \u03b3i : [0, \u221e) \u2192 X starting from x that remains in B1/i (x). Taking a convergent\nsubsequence of {\u03b3i }\u221e\ni=1 [13, \u00a72] gives a quasigeodesic \u03b3\u221e : [0, \u221e) \u2192 X whose image is {x}.\nThis contradicts the fact that a quasigeodesic has unit speed.\nSuppose that (ii) is not true. Then there is an \u01eb > 0 along with a sequence {ri }\u221e\ni=1\nconverging to zero and a sequence of quasigeodesic segments \u03b3i : [0, Li ] \u2192 X starting from\nx so that for all i \u2208 Z+ , we have that \u03b3i (Li ) \u2208 Sri (x), \u03b3i ([0, Li ]) \u2282 Bri (x) and Lrii \u2265 1 + \u01eb.\nRescaling the pointed Alexandrov space (X, x) by r1i and taking a convergent subsequence\nof {\u03b3i }\u221e\ni=1 [13, Theorem 2.2], we obtain a quasigeodesic segment \u03b3\u221e : [0, L\u221e ] \u2192 Cx X\nstarting at the vertex o of the tangent cone Cx X so that \u03b3\u221e (L\u221e ) \u2208 S1 (o) (if L\u221e < \u221e),\n\u03b3\u221e ([0, L\u221e ]) \u2282 B1 (o) and L\u221e \u2265 1 + \u01eb. However, one can check that a quasigeodesic in Cx X\nstarting at o must be a radial geodesic, which is a contradiction.\n\u0003\nLet us go back to the proof of Theorem 2.5, part (viii). As X is compact with Alexandrov\ncurvature bounded below, there is a K \u2265 0 so that for all quasigeodesic segments \u03b3 :\n[0, u] \u2192 X starting from x, all u\u2032 \u2208 [0, u] and all z \u2208 X,\n(2.30)\n\nd(\u03b3(u\u2032), z)2 \u2212\n\nu\u2032\nu \u2212 u\u2032\nd(\u03b3(u), z)2 \u2212\nd(x, z)2 \u2265 \u2212 K u\u2032(u \u2212 u\u2032).\nu\nu\n\nThen\n(2.31)\nAs\n(2.32)\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\nu\u2032\n1\n1\nu \u2212 u\u2032\n\u2032\n2\n2\n2\n\u2265 \u2212 K u\u2032 (u \u2212 u\u2032 ).\ninf d(\u03b3(u ), z) \u2212\nd(\u03b3(u), z) \u2212\nd(x, z)\n2t z\u2208X\nu\nu\n2t\n\n\u0014\nu\u2032\nu \u2212 u\u2032\nu \u2212 u\u2032\nu\u2032\n\u2032\ng(\u03b3(u )) \u2212\ng(\u03b3(u)) \u2212\ng(x) = inf\nsup\nf\n(z)\n\u2212\nf (w) +\nf\n(z\n)\n\u2212\nz \u2032 \u2208X z,w\u2208X\nu\nu\nu\nu\n\u2032\n\n\u0015\nd(\u03b3(u\u2032 ), z \u2032 )2\nu\u2032 d(\u03b3(u), z)2\nu \u2212 u\u2032 d(x, w)2\n,\n\u2212\n\u2212\n2t\nu\n2t\nu\n2t\n\nby considering the case when z \u2032 = z = w, we obtain\n(2.33)\n\ng(\u03b3(u\u2032)) \u2212\n\nu\u2032\nu \u2212 u\u2032\n1\ng(\u03b3(u)) \u2212\ng(x) \u2265 \u2212 K u\u2032(u \u2212 u\u2032 ).\nu\nu\n2t\n\nEquivalently,\n(2.34)\n\n1\ng(x) \u2212 g(\u03b3(u\u2032))\n1\ng(x) \u2212 g(\u03b3(u))\n+\nKu \u2265\n+\nK u\u2032 .\n\u2032\nu\n2t\nu\n2t\n\n\fTHE HAMILTON\u2013JACOBI SEMIGROUP ON LENGTH SPACES AND APPLICATIONS\n\n9\n\nIn order to prove that lim inf r\u21920+ \u03c8(r) = |\u2207\u2212 g|(x), suppose that lim inf r\u21920+ \u03c8(r) =\n\u221e\n|\u2207\u2212 g|(x) \u2212 \u01eb for some \u01eb > 0.

Thus the limit of the first term in\nthe right-hand side above, as s \u2192 0+ , is\n\u0012Z\n\u0013\n1\nKtQt g\n(3.14)\n\u2212\nlog\ne\nd\u03bd ,\nKt2\nX\nwhile the limit of the second term is\n\u0014 \u0012Z\n\u0013\u0015\nZ\n1\n1\nK(t+s)Q\ng\nKtQ\ng\nt\nt+s\nR\nlim\n(3.15)\ne\nd\u03bd \u2212\ne\nd\u03bd ,\nKt eKtQt g d\u03bd s\u21920+ s\nX\nX\nprovided that the latter limit exists. We rewrite the expression inside the square brackets\nas\n\u0013\n\u0013\nZ \u0012 K(t+s)Qt+sg\nZ \u0012 KtQt+sg\ne\n\u2212 eKtQt+sg\ne\n\u2212 eKtQt g\n(3.16)\nd\u03bd +\nd\u03bd.\ns\ns\nX\nX\n\nThe integrand of the first term in (3.16) can be rewritten as (eKtQt+sg )(eKsQt+sg \u2212 1)/s,\nwhich converges\nto (eKtQt g )KQt g as s \u2192 0+ . So the first integral in (3.16)\nR uniformly\nKtQt g\nconverges to X (KQt g)e\nd\u03bd.\nWe now turn to the second term of (3.16). By Theorem 2.5(vii), for \u03bd-almost all x \u2208 X\nwe have\n\u0012 \u2212\n\u0013\n|\u2207 Qt g(x)|2\n(3.17)\nQt+s g(x) = Qt g(x) \u2212 s\n+ o(1) ,\n2\nand therefore\n|\u2207\u2212 Qt g(x)|2\neKtQt+sg(x) \u2212 eKtQt g(x)\n= \u2212 KteKtQt g\n.\n(3.18)\nlim+\ns\u21920\ns\n2\nOn the other hand, parts (iv) and (v) of Theorem 2.5 imply that\n(3.19)\n\nQt+s g = Qt g + O(s).\n\nSince Qt g(x) is uniformly bounded in t and x, we deduce that\neKtQt+sg \u2212 eKtQt g\n= O(1)\ns\nas s \u2192 0+ . The combination of (3.18) and (3.20) makes it possible to pass to the limit by\ndominated convergence, to obtain\n\u0013\nZ \u0012 KtQt+sg\nZ\ne\n\u2212 eKtQt g\n|\u2207\u2212 Qt g|2 KtQt g\nd\u03bd = \u2212 Kt\n(3.21)\nlim+\ne\nd\u03bd.\ns\u21920\ns\n2\nX\nX\n(3.20)\n\n\f12\n\nJOHN LOTT AND C\u00c9DRIC VILLANI\n\nIn summary,\n(3.22)\nlim\n\ns\u21920+\n\n\u0014\n\n\u03c6(t + s) \u2212 \u03c6(t)\ns\n\n\u0015\n\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012Z\n\u0014 \u0012Z\n1\nKtQ\ng\nKtQ\ng\nt\nt\nR\ne\nd\u03bd +\ne\nd\u03bd log\n\u2212\n=\nKt2 X eKtQt g d\u03bd\nX\nX\n\u0015\nZ\nZ\n\u00012 KtQt g\n1\nKtQt g\n\u2212\n(KtQt g)e\nd\u03bd \u2212\nKt|\u2207 Qt g| e\nd\u03bd .\n2K X\nX\n\nInequality LSI(K) implies that this quantity is nonpositive, which concludes the proof. \u0003\n\nReferences\n[1] C.
