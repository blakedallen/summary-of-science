However, a possibility of redshift misidentification was not rejected with previous spectroscopy due to a narrow wavelength\ncoverage. We here present results of new deep spectroscopy covering the observed\n4,000\u20137,000 \u00c5 with VLT/VIMOS and Subaru/FOCAS of 8 LAEs detected in NB359.\nAll the eight objects have only one detectable emission line around 4,970 \u00c5 which is\nmost likely to be Ly\u03b1 at z = 3.1, and thus, the objects are certainly LAEs at the\nredshift. However, five of them show a \u223c 0.\u2032\u2032 8 spatial offset between the Ly\u03b1 emission\nand the source detected in NB359. No indications of the redshifts of the NB359 sources\nare found although it is statistically difficult that all the five LAEs have a foreground\nobject accounting for the NB359 flux. The rest three LAEs show no significant offset\nfrom the NB359 position. Therefore, we conclude that they are truly LyC emitting\nLAEs at z = 3.1. We also examine the stellar population which simultaneously accounts for the strength of the LyC and the spectral slope of non-ionizing ultraviolet\nof the LAEs. We consider the latest statistics of Lyman limit systems to estimate the\nLyC optical depth in the IGM and an additional contribution of the bound-free LyC\nfrom photo-ionized nebulae to the LyC emissivity. As a result, we find that stellar\npopulations with metallicity Z > 1/50Z\u2299 can explain the observed LyC strength only\nwith a very top-heavy initial mass function (IMF; hmi \u223c 50M\u2299 ). However, the critical\nmetallicity for such an IMF is expected to be much lower. A very young (\u223c 1 Myr) and\nmassive (\u223c 100 M\u2299 ) extremely metal-poor (Z 6 5 \u00d7 10\u22124 Z\u2299 ) or metal-free (so-called\nPopulation III) stellar population can reproduce the observed LyC strength. The required mass fraction of such 'primordial' stellar population is \u223c 1\u201310% in total stellar\nmass of the LAEs. We also present a possible evolutionary scenario of galaxies emitting\nstrong LyC and implications of the primordial stars at z \u223c 3 for the metal enrichment\nin the intergalactic medium and for the ionizing background and reionization.\nKey words: cosmology: observations - galaxies: evolution - galaxies: high-redshift\n- intergalactic medium\n\n\u22c6\n\nThis work is based on data collected with the Subaru Telescope\n\noperated by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan\n\n\f2\n1\n\nA. K. Inoue et al.\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe first generation of stars in the universe is the stellar\npopulation without any metal elements, or so-called Population III (Pop III) stars (e.g., Bromm & Larson 2004).\nThis population is expected to be as massive as \u223c 100\nM\u2299 (e.g., Bromm & Larson 2004) and is thought to play\nan important role on the cosmic reionization at z > 6 (e.g.,\nLoeb & Barkana 2001). How long did such metal-free star\nformation last in the universe? Although the metal enrichment in the intergalactic medium (IGM) is uncertain, if\nit is inefficient, metal-free haloes may form until z = 5\n(Trenti, Stiavelli, & Shull 2009), z = 2.5 (Tornatore et al.\n2007), or even z < 2 (Johnson 2010). The metal mixing\nprocess in the interstellar medium (ISM) of a galaxy is also\nuncertain, but a significant amount of metal-free gas may coexist with enriched gas for a few hundred Myr (Pan & Scalo\n2007). If it is true, metal-free stars may continue to form in\ngalaxies for such a long time.\nThe He ii \u03bb1640 emission line is proposed as a signature\nof Pop III stars because of their very hard ionizing spectrum\nexpected theoretically (Schaerer 2002, 2003). Nagao et al.\n(2008) made a wide and deep survey of the emission line at\nz \u223c 4 and obtained an upper limit on Pop III star formation\nrate density at the redshift. On the other hand, the emission\nline has been found in a composite spectrum of Lyman break\ngalaxies (LBGs) at z \u223c 3 (Shapley et al. 2003; Noll et al.\n2004). Jimenez & Haiman (2006) claimed that it was a signature of the metal-free stellar population in the LBGs.\nHowever, this He ii line is broad (FWHM \u223c 1500 km s\u22121 ),\nand thus, it is probably caused by stellar winds from WolfRayet stars with 'normal' metallicity (Shapley et al. 2003;\nNoll et al. 2004; Brinchmann, Pettini, & Charlot 2008).\nAnother signature of Pop III stars is a very large Ly\u03b1\nequivalent width (EW) as > 240 \u00c5 (Malhotra & Rhoads\n2002). Some surveys of Lyman \u03b1 emitters (LAEs) found\ngalaxies with such a large Ly\u03b1 EW at z = 3.1 (Nakamura\n2010), z = 4.5 (Malhotra & Rhoads 2002) and z = 5.7\n(Shimasaku et al. 2006). However, a clumpy dusty medium\nmay boost the EW only apparently (Neufeld 1991). In addition, there is a large uncertainty on the EW measurements\nbecause LAEs are so faint that we may not measure their\ncontinuum level accurately enough.\nThe stellar population with metal mass fraction (or\nmetallicity) Z < 10\u22125 , which is < 1/2000 Z\u2299 , is\nclassified as extremely metal-poor (EMP) stars (e.g.,\nBeers & Christlieb 2005) and may be the second generation\nof stars (Umeda & Nomoto 2003). Hundreds of low-mass\nEMP stars have been found in the halo of the Galaxy (e.g.,\nBeers & Christlieb 2005). Because of their long lifetime,\nthese stars are survivors of the early stage of the formation\nof the Galaxy. On the other hand, it is expected that their\nhigh-mass counterpart existed in the early days and died\nout until the current epoch (Tumlinson 2006; Komiya et al.\n2007). Yet, there is no direct observational evidence of such\nmassive EMP stars at high-z.\nAlthough there is no confident observational signature\n\n(program-ID: S07B-010 and S08B-046) and with the Very Large\nTelescope operated by the European Southern Observatory, Chile\n(program-ID: 081.A-0081).\n\u2020 E-mail: akinoue@las.osaka-sandai.ac.jp\n\nof primordial massive stellar populations such as Pop III\nand massive EMP stars so far, these populations should exist in the early universe. These stars emit strong ionizing\nradiation which should have played an important role in the\ncosmic reionization (e.g., Loeb & Barkana 2001) and have\naffected the galaxy formation in the subsequent epoch (e.g.,\nSusa & Umemura 2004). Therefore, looking for these stellar\npopulations is highly important to understand the feedback\nprocess by the first generation of stars and galaxies as well\nas to prove their existence.\nVery recently, some candidates of galaxies at z & 7 have\nbeen discovered by the standard drop-out technique from the\nnew data taken with the WFC3/IR camera on the Hubble\nSpace Telescope (Bouwens et al. 2010a; Oesch et al. 2010;\nBunker et al. 2009; McLure et al. 2010; Yan et al. 2010). Interestingly, Bouwens et al. (2010b) found that the ultraviolet (UV) colour of the z & 7 candidate galaxies was so blue\nthat the galaxies may be composed of EMP or metal-free\nstellar populations. However, we should confirm that the\nredshifts of the galaxies are really z & 7 with spectroscopy,\nwhich is too difficult to do with current facilities.\nInoue (2010) (hereafter Paper I) has proposed a new\nmethod to find the hypothetical stellar populations like massive EMP and metal-free stars at z . 4. When Lyman continuum (LyC) emitted by stars escapes from galaxies, the\nLyC emitted by photo-ionized nebulae around ionizing stars\nmay also escape. This bound-free nebular LyC has a peak\njust below the Lyman limit, so that a spectral 'bump' appears at the Lyman limit. We call this 'Lyman bump' or\nmore precisely 'Lyman limit bump'. The strength of the Lyman bump depends on the hardness of the stellar LyC. Thus,\nmore metal-poor galaxies will show stronger Lyman bump.\nOn the other hand, neutral hydrogen remains in the IGM\neven after the completion of the reionization and it significantly absorbs the LyC. It makes difficult to find LyC or\nLyman bump at z > 5 (Inoue & Iwata 2008).\nAre there galaxies with a Lyman bump in the real\nuniverse? This paper intends to show that the answer is\nyes. Iwata et al. (2009) (hereafter I09) discovered 10 LAEs\nand 7 LBGs at z \u223c 3 with a significant leakage of their\nLyC captured in a deep narrowband image taken with the\nSubaru/Suprime-Cam (S-Cam). Some of the LAEs are indeed brighter in LyC than in non-ionizing UV, strongly suggesting the presence of the Lyman limit bump. However,\nthere was a possibility that these objects are at lower-z\nbecause of a narrow wavelength coverage of previous spectroscopy which only confirmed an emission line.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. In section\n2, we first describe the sample of the possible LyC emitting LAEs discovered by I09. In section 3, we present results of follow-up spectroscopy with VLT/VIMOS and Subaru/FOCAS. In section 4, we thoroughly examine the redshift of the LAEs (i.e. the reality of the detected LyC) with\nthe follow-up deep spectra and conclude that at least three\nLAEs are real LyC emitters. In section 5, we compare the\nobserved strength of the LyC with the Lyman bump model\nproposed by Paper I and show that the LAEs are likely to\ncontain massive metal-free or EMP stars. In section 6, we\npresent a summary of our results, an evolutionary scenario\nof the LAEs, and a few implications of the existence of primordial stars at z \u223c 3.\nWe adopt the AB magnitude system (Oke 1974) to de-\n\n\fLyman 'bump' galaxies\nscribe object magnitudes and colours in section 5. The standard flat \u039bCDM cosmology with h = 0.7, \u03a9M = 0.3, and\n\u03a9\u039b = 0.7 is adopted if it is required.\n\n2\n\nTHE SAMPLE OF LAES EMITTING\nSTRONG LYMAN CONTINUUM\n\nWe mainly deal with the sample of LAEs detected in their\nLyC by I09. Since the detected LyC is too strong to be\nexplained with a standard stellar population model, I09 reported the detections but left their nature as a mystery.\nWe started from a sample of LAEs and Ly\u03b1 blobs\n(LABs) selected through a Subaru/S-Cam narrowband\nNB497 imaging in the SSA22 field (Hayashino et al. 2004;\nMatsuda et al. 2004, hereafter M04). The selection criteria of the LAEs were NB497 = 20.0\u201326.2 AB (2.\u2032\u2032 0 \u03c6,\n> 5\u03c3) and the observed equivalent width of the emission\nline > 80 \u00c5. Among them, we had 125 galaxies with spectroscopic redshift zspec > 3.0 measured with Subaru/FOCAS\nand Keck/DEIMOS (Matsuda et al. 2005, 2006, in preparation; Yamada et al. in preparation). I09 performed a very\ndeep imaging with another narrowband filter NB359 with\nSubaru/S-Cam (program-ID: S07B-010) in the same field.\nThe NB359 filter exactly captures LyC (\u2243 880 \u00c5) for z = 3.1\ngalaxies. In the NB359 image, I09 found 10 objects identified with the spectroscopically confirmed LAEs. The identification of NB359 (and R) sources with the spectroscopic\nLAEs was done by the following procedure: (1) object detections in NB359 and in R, (2) identification of each LAE\nwith the R object nearest from the barycentre of NB497\nintensity, and (3) either identification of a NB359 object\nwithin 1.\u2032\u2032 4 from the barycentre of R intensity or > 3\u03c3 detection at NB359 aperture photometry with 1.\u2032\u2032 4 diameter\naround the barycentre of R intensity. Here we present results of follow-up deep spectroscopy with VLT/VIMOS and\nSubaru/FOCAS for 5 out of the 10 LAEs in I09: the objects\na\u2013e in Table 1.\nIn addition, there are other \u223c 30 objects detected in the\nNB359 image and identified with the LAE candidates (i.e.\nnot confirmed spectroscopically yet) by the same procedure\ndescribed above. Among them, we also present results of\ndeep spectroscopy with VIMOS for 4 objects: f\u2013i in Table 1.1\nIn Table 1, we summarise some properties of the sample LAEs: coordinates in NB359 (LyC), offsets and position\nangles (PAs) of R and NB497 (Ly\u03b1) positions against the\npositions in NB359, and magnitudes in NB359 and R. As\nfound from the table, there are small offsets in the three\nbands; the offsets between R and NB359 are less than 0.\u2032\u2032 4\nand those between NB359 and NB497 are 0.\u2032\u2032 1\u20131.\u2032\u2032 0. The\noffsets of the continuum emission traced by R and NB359 of\nthe LAE sample are small and not significant relative to the\npositional uncertainty between the two bands (\u223c 0.\u2032\u2032 25; I09).\nWe should note that the R\u2013NB359 offsets of the LBG sample\nreported in I09 is much larger and significant (\u223c 0.\u2032\u2032 97 on\naverage). On the other hand, in some cases, the offsets between NB359 and NB497 of the LAE sample are significant.\nThis point will be discussed in detail in \u00a73.2 and \u00a74.2.\n\n1\n\nWe recently found that the spectrum of the object g were taken\nwith Subaru/FOCAS previously (Yamada et al. in preparation).\n\n3\n3.1\n\n3\n\nSPECTROSCOPY OF THE LAES\nPrevious medium-resolution spectroscopy\n\nWe have several sets of previous spectroscopy with Subaru/FOCAS and Keck/DEIMOS taken in 2003, 2004, and\n2005 (Matsuda et al. 2005, 2006, in preparation; Yamada\net al. in preparation) and have confirmed that all the 10\nLAEs reported by I09 have a prominent emission line at\naround 4,970 \u00c5 which was identified as Ly\u03b1 at z \u2243 3.1.\nDEIMOS observations in 2004 and FOCAS observations in\n2005 (Matsuda et al. 2006, in preparation; Yamada et al. in\npreparation) were made with a relatively high spectral resolution (R \u223c 2, 000) and rejected the possibility that the\nemission line was the [O ii] \u03bb3727 doublet at z = 0.33.\nHowever, the FOCAS observations in 2005 could not exclude the possibility that the line was C iv \u03bb1549, He ii\n\u03bb1640, C iii] \u03bb1909 or Mg ii \u03bb2798 from an AGN at redshift z = 2.2, 2.0, 1.6 or 0.78, respectively, or H\u03b2 from a\nvery faint galaxy at z = 0.022 because of a narrow wavelength coverage (\u2206\u03bb \u223c200 \u00c5). Since the full width at halfmaximum (FWHM) of the line was as narrow as 200\u2013600\nkm s\u22121 , the objects would be a type 2 if they were AGNs.\nHowever, some of the objects are spatially extended in the\nNB497 \u2212 BV image (i.e. line image), making the AGN interpretation unlikely. For example, the object a is identified\nas LAB by M04 and the object c has a FWHM of the line\nintensity profile of 1.\u2032\u2032 3 against a 1.\u2032\u2032 0 PSF (a significance of\n3-\u03c3).\n\n3.2\n\nVLT/VIMOS low-resolution spectroscopy\n\nWe performed a wide wavelength coverage (but low resolution) follow-up spectroscopy for 5 (objects a\u2013e) out of the\n10 LAEs reported by I09 with VLT/VIMOS (program-ID:\n081.A-0081). In addition, we took spectra of 4 (object f\u2013i)\nLAE candidates detected in the NB359 image. Unlike the\nprevious spectroscopy, we put slitlets on the positions detected in the NB359 image in order to take spectra of NB359\nemitting sources.\nThe observations were made with LR-Blue/OS-Blue\ngrism (R = \u03bb/\u2206\u03bb \u2243 180 and dispersion 5.36 \u00c5/pix) and\n1.\u2032\u2032 0 width slitlets on several dark nights during July to October 2008. The wavelength coverage of this setting is 3,700\u2013\n6,800 \u00c5. The plate scale is 0.\u2032\u2032 205/pix. We took two masks\n(each has 4 quadrants) and the exposure time was 4 hours for\neach mask. There was an overlap area of the two masks, so\nthat the object a was taken twice. The observing conditions\nwere good with typical seeing of 0.\u2032\u2032 8. The data reduction\nwas done by a standard procedure with iraf. The flux calibration was done with standard stars EG 274, G 158-100,\nand LTT 1020. Typical sky rms per pixel at around 5,000 \u00c5\nin the resultant two dimensional spectra is about 0.02 \u03bcJy.\nFigure 1 shows close-up images around 5,000 \u00c5 of the\nfinal two-dimensional spectra of 9 objects observed with\nVLT/VIMOS. In each panel, the area between the two\ndashed lines indicates 5 pixels (= 1.\u2032\u2032 0) centring around the\nposition of the NB359 source. To find the NB359 source position, we used an iraf task, geomatch, between the S-Cam\nimage and the VIMOS pre-image. A typical uncertainty of\nthis procedure is found to be \u223c 0.3 pix (= 0.\u2032\u2032 06). We also\nfound a few pix systematic offset between the pre-image and\n\n\f4\n\nA. K.

North is up.\n\nthe spectral images and corrected it based on the position of\nsome bright objects detected in both images (not the LAEs\ndiscussed in this paper).\nAs found in Figure 1, a significant spatial offset between the emission line and the NB359 position is evident in\nsome objects. The measured spatial offsets are summarised\nin Table 2 and consistent with those in Table 1 measured\nin the two narrowband images. Relatively large offset in the\nnarrowband images of the object a is probably due to the\nextended Ly\u03b1 emission classified as LAB. We categorise objects a, f and g into the sample without line offset (i.e. offset\n\n< 0.\u2032\u2032 2 = 1 pix) and objects b\u2013e and h into the sample with\nline offset based on the spectral image. The reason why we\nrely on the spectral image is that we can measure the offset between the continuum position and the pure emission\nline, whereas the NB497 intensity traces both the line and\nthe continuum. The last object i is found to be a broad-line\nAGN from the spectrum.\nFigures 2 and 3 show the one-dimensional spectra extracted at the NB359 source positions of the samples without and with the line offset, respectively.

In Table 2, we also list the redshifts measured\nassuming the emission line to be Ly\u03b1 and the flux density\ndecrements of the continua blueward and redward from the\nline. We measured the decrements both at the NB359 source\nposition and at the emission line position for the sample with\nline offset. We have corrected the decrements for the dust\nextinction by the Milky Way based on the extinction map\nby Schlegel et al. (1998). Figure 5 shows average composite\nspectra of both samples.\n\n3.3\n\nSubaru/FOCAS low-resolution spectroscopy\n\nWe have spectra of two objects a and b taken with Subaru/FOCAS (program-ID: S08B-046). The observation was\ndone with the 300B grism (dispersion: 1.34 \u00c5/pix) and the\nslit width of 0.\u2032\u2032 8 during the dark night on 22 September\n2008. The wavelength coverage of this observation is 4,000\u2013\n7,200 \u00c5. The resultant spectrum of the object a is very\nconsistent with those in Figure 2 but has a higher spectral\nresolution. On the other hand, we could not find any emission line in the spectrum of the object b. This is because\nthe position angle of the FOCAS slitlet (117\u25e6 ) was far from\nthat of the emission line from the NB359 position (43\u25e6 ; see\nTable 1). The position angle of the VIMOS slitlet was 0\u25e6\n(north-south) and we did capture a part of the emission line\nas shown in Figure 1.\n\nFigure 3.

We averaged the one-dimensional spectra in the restframe for the redshift assuming the emission line to be Ly\u03b1. The\nthick horizontal lines with numbers indicate mean flux densities\nwithin 1050\u20131150 \u00c5 and 1250\u20131350 \u00c5. At the latter wavelength\nrange, we normalised the spectra before making an average. The\nvalues are not corrected for the Galactic extinction. The vertical\ndashed lines indicate wavelengths of emission/absorption lines.\nThe vertical shaded regions show the ranges affected by Earth's\natmospheric lines.\n\n4\n\nREALITY OF THE LYMAN CONTINUUM\n\nIn this section, we discuss whether NB359 fluxes detected\nfrom the sample LAEs are truly LyC or not. Namely, we\ndiscuss whether the redshifts of the continuum sources are\nz \u2243 3.1 or not. As found in Figure 1, some objects show\na spatial offset of the emission line at around 4,970 \u00c5. We\n\nSample without line offset\nLine identification\n\nFrom the objects a, f, and g, we clearly detect an emission\nline at around 4,970 \u00c5 and no significant spatial offset from\nthe position detected in NB359. Therefore, the emission line\nis highly likely to come from the continuum source detected\nin NB359 (see \u00a74.1.2 about the probability of foreground\ncontamination). Finally, we conclude that the emission line\nis Ly\u03b1 at z \u2243 3.1 and the NB359 flux is truly LyC, based\non the following considerations.\nWe could not detect any significant emission/absorption\nlines except for the 4,970 \u00c5 line from the 3 galaxies shown\nin Figure 2. Upper limits (3-\u03c3) on the line flux ratio relative\nto the 4,970 \u00c5 line are < 0.10\u20130.18 at 4,000 \u00c5, < 0.10\u20130.18\nat 4,500 \u00c5, < 0.11\u20130.20 at 5,000 \u00c5, < 0.15\u20130.24 at 5,500 \u00c5,\n< 0.20\u20130.35 at 6,000 \u00c5, and < 0.24\u20130.42 at 6,500 \u00c5. These\nlimits are estimated from a comparison between a typical sky\nrms noise for 5-pix in spatial direction at a wavelength and\nthe 4,970 \u00c5 line flux. We have assumed that the postulated\nemission line has the same width as the 4,970 \u00c5 line. This\nassumption is justified if the lines are narrower than about\n1,600 km s\u22121 (i.e. R \u2243 180). These 3-\u03c3 upper limits of the\nline flux ratio indicate that we can exclude the existence of\nother emission lines even if the lines are a factor of 0.1 to\n0.5 weaker than the 4,970 \u00c5 emission line.\nLet us identify the 4,970 \u00c5 line. We consider 7 possible\nidentifications of the line. If the 4,970 \u00c5 line was C iv and\nthe galaxies were AGNs at z \u2243 2.2, we should have Ly\u03b1\naround 3,900 \u00c5. Based on the QSO average spectrum by\nFrancis et al. (1991), the flux ratio of Ly\u03b1 to C iv is 1.6.\nThus, we should detect the Ly\u03b1 in our spectra with a high\nsignificance. However, we could not. We could not detect He\nii and C iii] which have flux ratios relative to C iv of 0.3 and\n0.5, respectively (Francis et al. 1991; Heckman et al. 1995;\nKrolik 1999), either. If the 4,970 \u00c5 line was He ii or C iii]\nand the galaxies were AGNs at z \u2243 2.0 or 1.6, we could detect C iv which is stronger than the two lines (Francis et al.\n1991; Heckman et al. 1995; Krolik 1999) at around 4,690 \u00c5\nor 4,030 \u00c5. In the Mg ii case, we could detect a stronger [O\nii] emission line from narrow-line regions at around 6,630 \u00c5\n(Krolik 1999). In the [O ii] or the H\u03b2 cases, we could detect stronger [O iii] emission lines at around 6595/6659 \u00c5\nor 5,070/5,120 \u00c5, respectively. However, we could not at all.\nThe [O ii] interpretation had been already ruled out by the\nprevious medium-resolution spectra for the objects a\u2013e and\ng. In the case of Ly\u03b1 from star-forming galaxies at z = 3.1,\nwe do not expect any other stronger emission lines within\nthe wavelength coverage. Therefore, the single emission line\nin the wide wavelength coverage strongly suggests that the\nline is Ly\u03b1 and the objects lie at z \u2243 3.1.\nIf the galaxies are at z = 3.1, we expect Ly\u03b1 decrement\nto be 0.75 \u00b1 0.03 on average at around 1,100 \u00c5 in rest-frame\nof the galaxies (Inoue & Iwata 2008; Faucher-Gigu\u00e8re et al.\n2008) (Note that we are looking at Ly\u03b1 forest at z = 2.7 in\nthis wavelength.). Let us see the decrement in the spectra\nof the 3 objects (a, f and g) and the AGN (object i). Comparing the flux density within the rest-frame 1,050\u20131,150\n\n\fLyman 'bump' galaxies\n\u00c5 to that within 1,250\u20131,350 \u00c5 with the assumptions of the\n4,970 \u00c5 line to be Ly\u03b1 and a flat intrinsic spectrum between\n1,100 \u00c5 and 1,300 \u00c5 in the rest-frame, we find decrements of\n0.7\u20130.9 after correcting for the Galactic extinction as summarised in Table 2. Although the decrement of the object a\nis somewhat smaller than the expected, other three decrements are very consistent with the Ly\u03b1 forest measurement,\nagain supporting our interpretation that they are z \u2243 3.1\nobjects.\nIn summary, the 3 objects without line offset have a\nstrong and narrow emission line around 4,970 \u00c5 but do not\nhave any other detectable emission/absorption lines. Their\ncontinuum shows a small break below the emission line and\nthe amount of the decrement is consistent with that expected from Ly\u03b1 forest if they are at z \u2243 3.1. Therefore,\nwe conclude that the emission line is redshifted Ly\u03b1 and the\nobjects are truly LAEs at z \u2243 3.1.\n4.1.2\n\nProbability of foreground contamination\n\nEven when the emission line around 4,970 \u00c5 is the z \u2243 3.1\nLy\u03b1, the LAEs may have a foreground object on the line\nof sight towards them and the flux detected in NB359\nmay come from the low-z interloper. This possibility is\nextensively discussed in Vanzella et al. (2010a) (see also\nSiana et al. 2007, and I09). Let us estimate the probability to have a contamination in front of the 3 LAEs discussed\nin this subsection according to Vanzella et al. (2010a).\nThe 3 LAEs without line offset (a, f and g) are detected\nin NB359 with a magnitude of 26\u201327 AB (see Table 1) and\nthe spatial offset between the Ly\u03b1 emission line and the\ncontinuum is less than 0.\u2032\u2032 2 (= 1 pix) (see Table 2). Based on\nthe U -band number count by Nonino et al. (2009) of 130,200\ndeg\u22122 in this magnitude range, we expect only 0.126% of\nchance coincidence of an object within 0.\u2032\u2032 2 around another\nobject.\nThe object a is found from 10 objects reported by I09\namong 125 spectroscopic LAE sample. The 10 objects may\ninclude foreground contamination, but the probability that\none object picked up from the 10 objects has a foreground\nwithin 0.\u2032\u2032 2 is only 1.6%2 . The objects f and g are found\nfrom \u223c 30 objects detected in NB359 among \u223c 800 LAE\ncandidates. If we take two objects from the \u223c 30 sample,\nthe probability that both two have a foreground within 0.\u2032\u2032 2\nis only 0.1% and the probability that one has a foreground is\nstill 6.5%. Therefore, the three objects a, f and g are unlikely\nto be contaminated by foreground objects.\n4.1.3\n\nSpectroscopic properties\n\nWe here note a few more measurements from the spectra.

The line width is assumed to be the same as\nthat of Ly\u03b1.\nd Average composite.\nb\n\nFWHMs of Ly\u03b1 are smaller than the velocity resolution of\nour observations (\u2243 1, 600 km s\u22121 ). Thus, the line width\nis unresolved. The EWs of Ly\u03b1 in the rest-frame are 20\u2013\n80 \u00c5 in individual spectra and 43 \u00c5 in the average spectrum, which are not very large as expected for Pop III stars\n(e.g., Malhotra & Rhoads 2002; Schaerer 2002). If LyC escape fraction is relatively large, however, the expected EW\nof Ly\u03b1 decreases. The EW is further reduced by neutral\nhydrogen in the ISM and in the IGM because of resonant\nscattering. Therefore, the measured Ly\u03b1 EWs do not reject\nthe existence of Pop III stars in the three LAEs.\nThe He ii \u03bb1640 line is not detected and its 3-\u03c3 upper limits relative to Ly\u03b1 flux (FHeII /FLy\u03b1 ) are < 0.2\u20130.4,\nwhere we have assumed that the He ii line has the same\nwidth as Ly\u03b1. According to Schaerer (2003), the intrinsic\nFHeII /FLy\u03b1 < 0.02 is expected for a Pop III star cluster.\nSince only Ly\u03b1 photons will be scattered resonantly in the\nsurrounding ISM and IGM, the observed FHeII /FLy\u03b1 can be\nenhanced significantly. On the other hand, the He ii line is\ndetectable only in a short time-scale (< a few Myr) from\nthe Pop III star formation (Schaerer 2002). In any case, the\nobtained upper limits on FHeII /FLy\u03b1 are not strong enough\nto reject the presence of Pop III stars.\nWe could not detect any other emission/absorption lines\nin the spectra. The 3-\u03c3 flux upper limits of emission lines\nare 0.1\u20130.4 relative to Ly\u03b1 depending on the wavelength\n(\u00a74.1.1). In this respect, the three LAEs presented here are\ndifferent from the Lynx arc at z = 3.357 and a peculiar LAE\nat z = 5.563 emitting strong metal emission lines such as N\niv] \u03bb1486, C iv \u03bb1549, O iii] \u03bb1666 and C iii] \u03bb1909 as well as\nLy\u03b1 (Fosbury et al. 2003; Raiter, Fosbury, & Teimoorinia\n2010; Vanzella et al. 2010b). The observed fluxes of N iv]\nand C iv, which are in the wavelength coverage of our spectra, relative to Ly\u03b1 are 0.1\u20130.3, which could be marginally\ndetected in our spectra if there were. These two peculiar\ngalaxies are likely to have very hot (\u223c 105 K) exciting stars\n(Fosbury et al. 2003; Raiter, Fosbury, & Teimoorinia 2010)\nor small AGN (Vanzella et al. 2010b) and are as low metallicity as Z = 1/20Z\u2299 . On the other hand, our three LAEs\nmay have massive EMP or Pop III stars, whose effective\ntemperatures are also \u223c 105 K, as shown later (\u00a75). Nevertheless, we could not detect such metal emission lines. This\nmay imply that the metallicity of our three LAEs is much\nlower than Z = 1/20Z\u2299 which is consistent with the presence of EMP or Pop III stars.\n\n\f8\n\nA. K. Inoue et al.\n\n4.2\n\nSample with line offset\n\n4.2.1\n\nLine identification\n\nWe detected a prominent emission line at 4,970 \u00c5 around\nthe objects b\u2013e, and h as shown in Figure 1. However, the\nline offsets from the NB359 source position by 0.\u2032\u2032 5\u20131.\u2032\u2032 3,\nwhich correspond to 3.8\u20139.9 kpc (proper) if the objects lie\nat z = 3.1. In the emission line positions, we find no other\nemission/absorption lines. After a very similar discussion to\n\u00a74.1.1, we conclude that the emission line is likely to be Ly\u03b1\nat z \u2243 3.1. In the NB359 positions, we do not find any\nsignificant emission/absorption lines, either.\nWe measured Ly\u03b1 decrements in both NB359 and emission line positions of each object, assuming the emission line\nto be Ly\u03b1, and the results are summarised in Table 2. We\ndetect a significant (> 2-\u03c3) decrement at the continuum position of the object h and marginal (1\u20132-\u03c3) ones at the line\nposition of the objects b and e. Other cases are not conclusive because of not-significant continua although some cases\nmay imply no decrements. The decrements in the composite spectra are not conclusive, either, although that at the\nNB359 positions exceeds unity, indicating contaminations of\nforeground objects.\nIn summary, the emission lines detected in our spectra\nare likely to be Ly\u03b1, and thus, these objects are LAEs at z \u2243\n3.1. However, almost no information about redshift of the\nNB359 continuum sources was extracted from our spectra.\nThese sources may be physically associated with the close\nLAEs and their redshift may be z \u2243 3.1. Or these are just\nforeground objects apparently close to the LAEs.\n\n4.2.2\n\nProbability of foreground contamination\n\nAs discussed in \u00a74.1.2, there is a possibility that a foreground\ninterloper accounts for the NB359 flux (and other optical\nband fluxes). The 5 objects we are discussing here show an\noffset from Ly\u03b1 line by 0.\u2032\u2032 8 on average (see Table 2). Let us\nestimate the probability of such foreground contamination\naccording to Vanzella et al. (2010a) as done in \u00a74.1.2.\nThe observed NB359 magnitudes of the 5 objects (b\u2013\ne and h) are 26\u201327 AB same as the 3 LAEs without line\noffset. Then, the probability to have an object within 0.\u2032\u2032 8\naround another object is 2.02% based on the spatial density\nof U = 26\u201327 AB sources reported by Nonino et al. (2009).\nThe objects b\u2013e are selected from 10 LAEs which were\nfound from 125 spectroscopic LAEs and reported by I09.\nThe probability that all the four taken from the 10 sample\nhave a foreground within 0.\u2032\u2032 8 is only 0.8%, but the probabilities that 3, 2, 1, or 0 objects have a foreground are\n5.7%, 20.6%, 39.8%, or 33.2%. The object h are found from\n\u223c 30 objects detected in NB359 among \u223c 800 LAE candidates. The probability that the object is contaminated by\na foreground within 0.\u2032\u2032 8 is 53.8%. Therefore, a few of the\nfive objects are likely to be contaminated by a foreground.\nHowever, it is very difficult to conclude that all the five are\ncontaminated.\nAs found in Table 2, the objects d and e have a relatively large offset (> 1.\u2032\u2032 0) and no indication of Ly\u03b1 decrement at the NB359 positions. It may suggest that these are\ncontaminations. On the other hand, the object c has the\nsmallest offset and a possible indication of decrement, may\n\nsuggesting that it is a real LyC emitter. However, it is impossible to conclude which objects are contaminations using\nthe current data.\n\n4.2.3\n\nPossible causes of Ly\u03b1 line offset\n\nWe can still expect that a few objects among the 5 are associated with LAEs at z \u2243 3.1 and the NB359 traces the\nLyC according to the statistical argument obtained in \u00a74.2.2.\nIn other words, the offset between the Ly\u03b1 emission line\nand the continuum could be real in a few cases. For example, it is possible that a galaxy is composed of multiple\nsubstructures and every component emits both the continuum and the emission line. However, the line flux relative\nto the continuum (i.e. EW) are different from each other.\nIn fact, such a situation is observed in local galaxies emitting Ly\u03b1 (\u00d6stlin et al. 2009). Then, if we observe the galaxy\nas a single object with an insufficient spatial resolution, the\nbarycentre of the emission line intensity and of the continuum will offset.\nAnother possibility is that Ly\u03b1 emission comes\nfrom 'cold accretion' into galaxies (Dijkstra & Loeb 2009;\nGoerdt et al. 2010; Faucher-Gigu\u00e8re et al. 2010). The 'cold\naccretion (or stream)' is thought to be the main mode to\nfeed gas to galaxies (Dekel et al. 2009), and its temperature is \u223c 104 K, so that it emits Ly\u03b1. Galaxies have multiple streams and Ly\u03b1 emission from the streams is spatially extended (Dijkstra & Loeb 2009; Goerdt et al. 2010;\nFaucher-Gigu\u00e8re et al. 2010). If we observe such an extended Ly\u03b1 emission with insufficient spatial resolution, the\nbarycentre of the emission may offset from the stellar component.\nTherefore, the Ly\u03b1 offset may not be a surprising event\nfor LAEs in general. However, we have no further clue to\nresolve which is a real z \u2243 3.1 object for the moment.\n\n5\n\nREST UV TWO-COLOUR DIAGRAM\n\nIn this section, we try to interpret atypical UV colours of\nthe LAEs (and also LBGs) detected in LyC. Figure 6 shows\na two-colour diagram in the rest-frame UV of the LAEs and\nLBGs. We consider that the 3 LAEs without line offset (filled\ncircles) are emitting LyC and a few of the 5 LAEs with line\noffset (open circles) are possibly emitting LyC. The 7 LBGs\nreported by I09 are also shown by filled squares. Additionally, we show the AGN (object i) found in this study. The\ncolours are measured at the barycentre in R with a circular aperture whose diameter is chosen from 1.\u2032\u2032 2 to 2.\u2032\u2032 6 for\neach object so as to include its total flux as done in I09.3\nNote that there are differences from Table 1 because of the\ndifferent method of measurements.\n\n3 There was a revision of zero-points in V , R, and i\u2032 after publication of I09 and the resultant shifts in the two colour diagram as\nfollows: \u2206(NB359 \u2212 R) = +0.1 and \u2206(V \u2212 i\u2032 ) = +0.1. Although\nthe zero-point revision is almost settled, we conservatively apply\nadditional systematic uncertainties of 0.1 mag to the error-bars of\nthe observed points by the quadratic combination with statistical\nuncertainties in photometry.\n\n\fLyman 'bump' galaxies\n\n9\n\nFigure 6. Rest UV two-colour diagram for z \u2243 3.1 LyC emitting galaxies. The vertical axis, V \u2212 i\u2032 , indicates non-ionizing UV spectral\nslope, and the horizontal axis, NB359\u2212R, indicates LyC-to-UV flux density ratio. The filled circles with errorbars are the 3 LAEs without\nline offset and the open circles with errorbars are the 5 LAEs with line offset. The squares with errorbars are LBGs reported in Iwata et\nal. (2009). The plus mark with errorbars is an AGN emitting LyC found in this study. The intrinsic colours of stellar population models\nare shown by diamond (the model D in Table 4), asterisk (C), x-marks (large: B1; small: B2), triangles (large: A1; small: A2) and inverse\ntriangles (large: Ac1 with 100 Myr; small: Ac2 with 100 Myr). The two horizontal arrows show IGM minimum and median attenuations\nfor z = 3.1. The two diagonal arrows show dust attenuations with E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.1 for the SMC law (solid arrow) and the Calzetti law\n(dashed arrow). The shaded regions indicate the regions explained by the stellar population model A1 with a combination of IGM and\ndust attenuations.\n\nTable 4.

The SED of pure stellar populations depends on metallicity, initial mass function (IMF), star formation history, and age. Since we are dealing with LAEs\n(and LBGs), we consider sub-solar metallicities: Z = 1/5 Z\u2299\nand 1/50 Z\u2299 . In addition, we consider two more metallicities: Z = 1/2000 Z\u2299 (EMP) and 0 (metal-free). SEDs for the\nformer two metallicities are generated by the population synthesis code starburst99 version 5.1 (Leitherer et al. 1999).\nThose for the latter two are taken from Schaerer (2002,\n2003). The IMF is basically assumed to be Salpeter's one\n(Salpeter 1955): \u03c6(m)dm \u221d mp dm with p = \u22122.35. Ad-\n\nditionally, we consider an extremely top-heavy case with\np = \u22120.1. The mass range of the IMF is assumed to be\nmup = 100 M\u2299 and mlow = 1 M\u2299 for Z = 1/5 Z\u2299 and\n1/50 Z\u2299 cases but to be mup = 500 M\u2299 and mlow = 50\nM\u2299 for the EMP and metal-free cases. The average stellar masses are 3.1 M\u2299 , 48 M\u2299 , or 111 M\u2299 depending on\nthe IMF. We consider age of 1 Myr after an instantaneous\nstar formation or 10 Myr to 1 Gyr constant star formation.\nTable 4 is a summary of the models and their parameters.\nIn Figure 6, the intrinsic (i.e. no dust and IGM attenuations) colours of the stellar population models are shown\nby diamond (metal-free: the model D), asterisk (EMP: the\nmodel C), x-marks (extremely top-heavy IMF but normal\nsub-solar metallicity: the models B1 and B2), triangles (nor-\n\n\f10\n\nA. K. Inoue et al.\n\nmal IMF and sub-solar metallicity: the models A1 and A2),\nand inverse triangles (normal IMF and sub-solar metallicity but constant star formation: the models Ac1 and Ac2).\nNB359\u2212R colours of the 3 LAEs without line offset (large\nfilled circles) and LBGs (small squares) seem to be explained\nby a model with normal IMF and metallicity (models A and\nAc). However, the IGM attenuation makes NB359\u2212R redder\nas described in the next subsection.\n5.2\n\nIGM attenuation\n\nSince the IGM attenuation, especially for the LyC, has\na stochastic nature, we estimate the amount based on a\nMonte-Carlo simulation by Inoue & Iwata (2008) (hereafter\nII08). These authors assumed an empirical distribution function of the intervening absorbers in redshift, column density,\nand Doppler parameter spaces which was derived from the\nlatest observational statistics in that time. Their simulation\nreproduces the Ly\u03b1 depressions at z = 0\u20136 very well.\nThe LyC opacity is mainly determined by the Lyman limit systems (LLSs; clouds with log 10 (NHI /cm\u22122 ) >\n17.2), we compare the number density evolution adopted\nin II08 with new survey results after the paper in Figure 7. We find that observational data are not converged\nyet; Prochaska et al. (2010) obtained smaller number of\nLLSs at z < 4 than those by P\u00e9roux et al. (2005) and\nSongaila & Cowie (2010). We also find that the simulation\nby II08 adopted a number density tracing upper bounds of\nobservations. In order to match the new observations, we\nhave reduced the LLS number density, with almost keeping\nthe number densities of Ly\u03b1 forest and damped Ly\u03b1 systems4 . The updated number density evolution is shown by\ndiamonds in Figure 7. The new number density of LLSs at\nz = 2.9 which attenuate the NB359 flux of z = 3.09 sources\nis about 60% of the previous one.\nFigure 8 shows the cumulative probability of the IGM\nattenuation through the NB359 for sources at z = 3.09\nwhich is the typical redshift of our LAEs (and LBGs). To estimate the attenuation, we have assumed a constant source\nspectrum in f\u03bd unit. The effect of the different shape of the\nspectrum is negligible because the wavelength coverage in\nthe NB359 is narrow. As found in the figure, the updated\nversion (solid line) expects much smaller attenuation than\nthe original II08 (dashed line). The median attenuation is\nreduced from 1.08 mag to 0.60 mag. Thus, the LLS number density has a significant impact on the expected IGM\nattenuation. We also find that the attenuation of the smallest 0.15% (e.g., smaller 3-\u03c3 excess for Gaussian) is 0.35 mag\n(II08) or 0.28 mag (updated). These attenuations are realized on a line of sight without LLS at z \u2243 3 and produced\nby numerous and unavoidable Ly\u03b1 forest. Because the update in the number density of absorbers is small for Ly\u03b1\nforest, the reduction of the smallest attenuations is small.\n\nFigure 7. The number density evolution of Lyman limit systems\nwhich have log10 (NHI /cm\u22122 ) > 17.2. Observational data are the\nfilled circles (P\u00e9roux et al. 2005), squares (Songaila & Cowie\n2010), and triangles (Prochaska et al. 2010; a factor of 1.1 larger\nthan their Table 4 which are the density for log10 (NHI /cm\u22122 ) >\n17.5). Monte-Carlo simulations are shown by the open circles (Inoue & Iwata 2008) and the diamonds (updated version).\n\nFigure 8. The cumulative probability to have an IGM attenuation in NB359 for z = 3.09 sources smaller than that in the horizontal axis, based on our Monte-Carlo simulations: the dashed\nline (Inoue & Iwata 2008) and the solid line (updated version).\nThe number of realizations of lines of sight is 10,000. The narrowband filter NB359 captures 852\u2013905 \u00c5 in the rest-frame of the\nsources. The inset shows a close-up of the smallest attenuation.\n\nWe adopt the attenuation at the cumulative probability of\n0.15% as the minimum IGM attenuation in the following.\nIn Figure 6, we show the minimum and median IGM\nattenuations by short and long horizontal arrows. We note\nthat the IGM attenuations for other bands in Figure 6 are\nzero (for R and i\u2032 ) or negligibly small (for V ). Table 5 gives\na summary of the IGM attenuation.\n\n4\n\nThis is realized only if we change three parameters among ten\nin the empirical distribution function of absorbers. The change\nis (A, \u03b21 , \u03b22 ) = (400, 1.6, 1.3) to (500, 1.7, 1.2), where A is the\nnormalisation of the number of absorbers, and \u03b21 and \u03b22 are the\nindices of the double power-law for the column density distribution. Note that we should keep the number density of Ly\u03b1 forest\nbecause the Ly\u03b1 decrements by II08 excellently agree with observations.\n\n5.3\n\nDust attenuation\n\nIf galaxies contain dust, they are reddened. Let us assume two types of dust attenuation law: the Calzetti law\n(Calzetti et al. 2000) and the extinction law of the Small\nMagellanic Cloud (SMC). The former attenuation law was\n\n\fLyman 'bump' galaxies\n\n11\n\nTable 5.

However, recent studies for z = 2\u2013\n3 LBGs suggest that a steeper attenuation law than the\nCalzetti one is favourable for some cases (Reddy et al. 2006;\nSiana et al. 2009). Thus, we also adopt the SMC law which is\nthe steepest among the known attenuation/extinction laws.\nWe use the model by Weingartner & Draine (2001) which\nreproduces the empirical SMC extinction law very well.\nThe Calzetti law is originally only for \u03bb > 1200 \u00c5\n(Calzetti et al. 2000). However, we simply extrapolate the\noriginal formula for \u03bb < 1200 \u00c5. This could be justified\nby the study of Leitherer et al. (2002) up to \u03bb = 970 \u00c5\n(but see also Buat et al. 2002) and also be justified by the\nmodel of Weingartner & Draine (2001) which does not show\nany breaks or features up to about 700 \u00c5 for graphite and\nastronomical silicate (Draine & Lee 1984). Table 5 gives a\nsummary of the dust reddenings.\nIn Figure 6, we show the region which can be explained\nby a model with normal sub-solar metallicity and IMF and\nwith a combination of dust and IGM attenuations. While a\nhalf of LBGs are found in the region, all the LAEs are out\nof it. We need a new model to explain these LAEs.\n\n5.4\n\nModels with escaping nebular Lyman\ncontinuum\n\nPaper I has proposed the importance of an additional contribution by escaping nebular LyC. For an escape of the stellar LyC, the ionized nebulae should be 'matter-bounded',\nat least along some lines of sight, from which we can also\nexpect an escape of nebular LyC produced by the recombination process. Paper I shows that this escaping nebular\nLyC makes a peaky spectral feature just below the Lyman\nlimit, which we call Lyman limit 'bump' (see Figs. 3 and 4\nin Paper I). In fact, our NB359 filter exactly captures this\nLyman limit bump at z \u2243 3.1. Let us compare this scenario\nwith the observed strength of LyC.\nFigure 9 shows how the Lyman limit bump blues\nNB359\u2212R colour; the colour becomes bluer when a fraction of LyC is absorbed by nebulae and reemitted in the\nLyman limit bump than when all the LyC escapes. Indeed,\nthe bluest colour is realized when about 40% LyC is absorbed (i.e. the escape fraction is about 60%), irrespective\nof the stellar population model. Based on Figure 9, we find\nthat moderate sub-solar metallicity and normal IMF (solid\nline: model A1) cannot reach NB359\u2212R < 0.4 (0.7) for the\nminimum (median) IGM attenuation even if we consider the\nadditional contribution by nebular LyC. On the other hand,\n\nFigure 9. NB359\u2212R colour for z = 3.1 galaxies, which corresponds to the strength of the Lyman limit 'bump', as a function\nof the escape fraction of stellar LyC: (a) minimum IGM attenuation case and (b) median IGM attenuation case. The curves are\nthe models with escaping nebular LyC: the long-dashed curve for\nthe model D in Table 4, the short-dashed curve for the model C,\nthe dot-dashed curve for the model B1, and the solid curve for the\nmodel A1. The nebular gas temperature is assumed to be 1 \u00d7 104\nK.\n\nsome z \u2243 3.1 LAEs detected in LyC show a much bluer\ncolour. Furthermore, even the LAEs with NB359\u2212R > 0.4\nare difficult to be explained because of their red colour in\nV \u2212 i\u2032 which expect much redder NB359\u2212R as shown in\nFigure 6.\nFigures 10\u201312 show the two-colour diagrams same as\nFigure 6 but with escaping nebular LyC models. In each\npanel, the curve with symbols shows the colour sequence\nas a function of the escape fraction of the stellar LyC. We\nhave assumed the minimum IGM attenuation for the curves.\nThe symbols indicate the colours when the escape fraction\nis 1.0 (i.e. pure stellar colour + minimum IGM), 0.1, or\n0.01. As the escape fraction decreases, NB359\u2212R colour first\nbecomes bluer than the stellar one due to the Lyman limit\nbump as shown in Figure 9, and then, the colour turns over\nwhen the escape fraction is about 0.6 and becomes redder\nand redder after the bluest point. In the same time, V \u2212 i\u2032\ncolour becomes redder than the stellar one because of the\nnebular continuum by two-photon and bound-free processes.\nThe amount of these colour changes depends on the strength\nof the stellar LyC: larger changes by stronger LyC.\nThe shaded region in each panel of Figures 10\u201312 shows\nthe colours explained by a combination of IGM and dust attenuations for a specific stellar population model. The thickness of the shades indicate the cumulative probability of the\nIGM attenuation: higher probability, thicker. We have assumed the SMC extinction law for the dust attenuation but\nthe Calzetti law cases are included in the shaded regions like\nin Figure 6.\nFigure 10 shows the cases of the normal stellar population with a constant star formation (Ac1 in Table 4). We\nhave assumed Z = 1/50 Z\u2299 , very low, but, sometimes observed metallicity (hereafter we call it normally sub-solar).\nThe case with Z = 1/5 Z\u2299 is always redder in NB359\u2212R\nthan the case with Z = 1/50 Z\u2299 . We find that all the LAEs\n(filled and open circles) and half of the LBGs (squares) cannot be explained even with the duration of the star formation of 10\u2013100 Myr which is younger than a typical age\nof LBGs (\u223c 300 Myr; Shapley et al. 2003). Therefore, we\n\n\f12\n\nA. K. Inoue et al.\n\nFigure 10. Same as Fig. 6 but a comparison with the escaping\nnebular LyC scenario of a continuous star-forming galaxy with\nZ = 1/50 Z\u2299 (model Ac1): (a) age from the onset of star formation of 100 Myr and (b) 10 Myr. The dotted curves indicate colour\nsequences as a function of the escape fraction of stellar LyC with\nthe minimum IGM attenuation. The symbols indicate the positions with the escape fraction of 1.0, 0.1, or 0.01. The shaded\nregions indicate the regions explained with a combination of IGM\nand dust attenuations. From thin to thick, the cumulative probability to have the amount of the IGM attenuation increases. The\nSMC extinction law is adopted for the dust attenuation as shown\nby the solid arrow. The nebular gas temperature is assumed to\nbe 1 \u00d7 104 K.\n\nconclude that the LyC emitting LAEs should have a stellar population much younger than 10 Myr or much more\nmassive than the standard Salpeter IMF.\nFigure 11 shows the cases of very young (age of 1 Myr)\nstellar populations with Z = 1/50 Z\u2299 , normally sub-solar\nmetallicity. The case with Z = 1/5 Z\u2299 is about 0.2 mag\nredder in NB359\u2212R than the case. Assuming the standard\nSalpeter IMF (panel [a]; model A1), we find that it is still\ndifficult to explain all the LAEs. On the other hand, if we\nassume an extremely top-heavy IMF whose mean mass is\nabout 50 M\u2299 (panel [b]; model B1), the LAEs without\nline offset (filled circles) can be explained with an attenuation smaller than the median. However, it is still difficult to explain the LAEs with line offset (open circles). We\nmay have a few true LyC emitters in the 5 objects because\nwe have statistically rejected the possibility that all the 5\nhave a faint foreground object accounting for the NB359\nflux in \u00a74.2.2. There is another difficulty of the model B1.\nThe critical metallicity for the IMF change from the standard to top-heavy, Zcr . 10\u22123 Z\u2299 (Bromm & Loeb 2003;\nSchneider et al. 2003, 2006) is expected to be much lower\nthan Z = 1/50 Z\u2299 which is assumed in the model B1. Thus,\n\nFigure 11. Same as Fig. 10 but the cases of a very young (1 Myr)\nstellar population with Z = 1/50 Z\u2299 : (a) normal IMF (model A1;\nsolid line with triangles) and (b) extremely top-heavy IMF (model\nB1: mean stellar mass of \u223c 50 M\u2299 ; dot-dashed line with crosses).\n\na very massive IMF under the relatively 'high' metallicity\nin the model B1 is unlikely. Then, we conclude that it is\ndifficult to explain the strength of LyC of the LAEs with\nnormally sub-solar metallicity unless the critical metallicity\nfor the IMF change is much higher than expected in the\nliterature.\nFigure 12 shows the cases of very young (age of 1\nMyr) and massive (\u223c 100 M\u2299 ) stellar populations with\nZ = 1/2000 Z\u2299 (EMP; model C; panel [a]) and Z = 0 (Pop\nIII; model D; panel [b]). In these cases, we can expect a\nvery massive IMF according to the critical metallicity scenario (Bromm & Loeb 2003; Schneider et al. 2003, 2006).\nWith the model C, we can easily explain the three LAEs\nwhich are confirmed to be true LyC emitters, whereas the\nLAEs with line offset are still difficult, except for the object b. The Pop III case (model D) can explain the objects\nb and c, and marginally explain e and h. The object d is\nstill difficult but this object shows the largest offset of the\nLy\u03b1 (Table 2), and thus, the foreground probability is the\nhighest. On the other hand, the object c shows the smallest\noffset and is the most likely object as a real LyC emitter\namong the 5 offset LAEs. Enough interestingly, the Pop III\nmodel can explain the object with a 1\u201320% smallest IGM\nattenuation. In summary, very young (\u223c 1 Myr) and massive (\u223c 100 M\u2299 ) EMP stars can reproduce the observed\ncolours of the three LAEs without line offset and Pop III\nstars can reproduce even the colours of most of the LAEs\nwith line offset. Because a few line-offset LAEs are likely to\nbe real LyC emitters, we conclude that the Pop III model is\n\n\fLyman 'bump' galaxies\n\nFigure 12.

But how\nmuch amount of these exotic stars are required in them?\nAlso, are Pop III stars really compatible with a slight dust\nattenuation which is required to explain some LAEs with\nline offset and red in V \u2212 i\u2032 in Figure 12? To discuss these\nquestions, let us consider a system in which a primordial\nstellar population and a normal stellar population with subsolar metallicity and Salpeter IMF coexist. We assume that\nthe normal population makes stars with a constant rate;\nthe model Ac2 in Table 4 is adopted for this population.\nFor the primordial population, we adopt the model D (Pop\nIII). The stellar mass of the normal population is defined\nas the multiple of the star formation rate and the duration;\nwe neglect the loss of the stellar death for simplicity. The\nmass fraction of the primordial population in the total stellar mass is a parameter for the mixture. The contribution\nof nebular continuum in LyC and in other wavelengths is\ntaken into account for both populations but with different\nescape fractions: 0.5 for the primordial population and 0.01\nfor the normal population.5 The normal population may ex5\n\nIn addition to the photo-ionized gas, we can consider the freefree radiation from hot gas produced by SNe and stellar winds.\n\n13\n\nFigure 13. Same as Fig. 6 but comparisons with models of two\nstellar populations: the cases with models D (Pop III) and Ac2\n(underlying population with a sub-solar metallicity, 1/5 Z\u2299 , and\na normal IMF) in Table 4. A constant star formation of 100 Myr is\nassumed for the underlying population. The SMC extinction law\nis assumed for the panel (a) but the Calzetti attenuation law is assumed for (b). The median IGM attenuation is assumed for both\npanels. The short-dashed curves are the sequences of the colour\nas a function of the mass fraction of Pop III stars for dust-free\nunderlying stellar population. The solid, dot-dashed, and longdashed curves are the same sequences but for dusty underlying\npopulation with E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3, respectively. Note\nthat the Pop III stars are assumed to be always dust-free. The\npositions for the mass fraction of 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, and 0.0001 are\nindicated by dotted curves with squares, triangles, asterisks, and\nplus-mark, respectively. For Pop III stars, the contribution of escaping nebular LyC is taken into account, assuming the escape\nfraction of 0.5. The colour sequence with other escape fractions\nis shown by the triple-dot-dashed curve as in Fig. 12. For the\nunderlying population, the escape fraction of 0.01 is assumed.\n\nist in dusty environment, but the primordial population are\nlikely to be dust-free. We adopt two dust attenuation laws:\nthe SMC extinction law and the Calzetti attenuation law as\ndescribed in \u00a75.3 only for the normal underlying population.\nThe required mass fraction of the primordial stellar population depends on the duration of the star formation in the\nunderlying normal population. This is because the mass of\nthe primordial population which is required to explain blue\n\nWe have assumed that the total energy of the hot gas radiation to be 5% and 1% of the bolometric stellar luminosities for\nthe primordial population (as done in Paper I) and for the normal population (Leitherer et al. 1999), respectively. The hot gas\ntemperature is assumed to be 1 \u00d7 106 K. However, this hot gas\ncontribution is negligible as shown in Fig. 3 of Paper I.\n\n\f14\n\nA. K. Inoue et al.\n\nNB359\u2212R colour does not change very much because the\ncolour is determined mainly by the primordial population,\nwhile the mass of the underlying population is proportional\nto the duration. For example, we consider 100 Myr as a duration for z = 3 galaxies (e.g., Shapley et al. 2003). The\nresults are shown in Figure 13. For other durations, the primordial mass fraction is roughly estimated by an inverse\nrelation to the durations of the underlying star formation.\nAlthough we assumed the median IGM attenuation in Figure 13, the readers can shift all the model curves along the\nhorizontal axis for other IGM attenuations.\nThe LAEs without offset (objects a, f and g; filled circles in Fig. 13) require a primordial mass fraction of 0.1\u201310%\ndepending on the IGM and dust attenuations as well as the\nstar formation duration. The dust attenuation for the underlying population is modest as E(B \u2212 V ) = 0\u20130.1 for the\nSMC case or up to 0.3 for the Calzetti case, which is reasonable for z \u223c 3 LAEs (e.g., Gawiser et al. 2006). The bluest\nLAEs (objects b and c; open circles) require a primordial\nmass fraction of more than 10%, but we could not reject\nthe possibility that their NB359 flux was foreground contamination individually (\u00a74.2). The LAEs which are red in\nV \u2212 i\u2032 (objects d, e and h; open circles) can be explained\nby a model with the SMC law and a small amount of attenuation as E(B \u2212 V ) \u2243 0.2\u20130.3 and with a primordial mass\nfraction of a few 0.1%. When the Calzetti law is adopted,\nthe red LAEs require a large amount of dust attenuation as\nE(B \u2212 V ) > 0.5 which may be too large. Note that the possibility which the NB359 flux of these objects, especially d\nand e, are foreground contamination is the largest because\nof the largest line offset (\u00a74.2).\nThe LBGs from which I09 reported detections of LyC\n(filled squares) are found in the range of the primordial mass\nfraction of 0.01\u20131 % depending on the dust attenuations.\nThus, only a very small amount of primordial stars can account for the observed LyC of these galaxies. On the other\nhand, some of these LBGs can be explained by a normal\npopulation with a large escape fraction of \u223c 0.5 as shown in\nFigures 10 and 11. Therefore, the primordial stars are not\nmandatory for them.\n\n6\n\nSUMMARY AND DISCUSSIONS\n\nWe have investigated the nature of the LAEs at z \u2243 3.1\ndetected in our deep narrowband NB359 imaging with\nSubaru/S-Cam. The NB359 captures LyC from z > 3. Thus,\nwe detect LyC from the LAEs if they are at z \u2243 3.1.\nThese LAEs are special because of their surprisingly strong\nLyC relative to non-ionizing UV (I09). Deep follow-up spectroscopy with VLT/VIMOS and Subaru/FOCAS for 8 such\nLAEs presented in \u00a73 shows that at least three of them are\nhighly likely to be at z \u2243 3.1 and the NB359 captures truly\ntheir LyC (\u00a74.1.1 and \u00a74.1.2). From the spectra of the three\nLAEs, we have derived the rest-frame EW of Ly\u03b1 which are\nnot very large as expected from primordial stellar population\nmodels such as Pop III stars. We have also derived upper\nlimits on the He ii \u03bb1640 emission line which are not strict\nenough to reject Pop III star formation (Table 3). Other five\nout of the 8 LAEs show a \u223c 0.\u2032\u2032 8 offset between the Ly\u03b1\nemission and the continuum detected in NB359 (Figure 1).\nFor these LAEs, we could not determine the redshifts of the\n\ncontinuum sources (\u00a74.2.1). However, it is statistically difficult that all the five have foreground contamination which\nexplain the NB359 detections (\u00a74.2.2). Thus, NB359 may\ncapture LyC from a few of the five LAEs with line offset.\nVery interestingly, all the LAEs reported by I09 are too\nbright in LyC to be explained by normal stellar population\nmodels (Figure 6). Although we reduced IGM opacity to\nmatch the latest LLS statistics (Figures 7 and 8), compared\nto the previous estimate, this is true even for the three LAEs\nwhich are confirmed to be at z \u2243 3.1. Unlike traditional\nspectral models of galaxies, Paper I proposed a new model\ntaking an escape of nebular LyC into account. This model\nexpects a strong flux excess just below the Lyman limit: we\ncall it Lyman limit 'bump'. We tried to explain the observed\nstrength in LyC of the LAEs with this new Lyman 'bump'\nmodel. As a result, we have found that the colour of the\nLAEs cannot be explained by the stellar population with\nthe standard Salpeter IMF and normally sub-solar metallicity (Z > 1/50 Z\u2299 ) even with the Lyman 'bump' (Figures 10\nand 11a). If we assume a very young (\u223c 1 Myr) stellar population with an extremely top-heavy IMF (mean mass of \u223c 50\nM\u2299 ) and Z = 1/50 Z\u2299 , the three LAEs without line offset\ncan be explained with a relatively smaller IGM attenuation\nbut other five LAEs with line offset cannot be explained yet\n(Figure 11b). Because (1) a few of the line-offset LAEs are\npossibly to be real LyC emitters and (2) the expected critical metallicity for a top-heavy IMF is much lower than the\nassumed Z = 1/50 Z\u2299 , we reject this model. This suggests\nthat the LAEs contain a significant amount of 'primordial'\nstars such as EMP or Pop III stars.\nA very young (\u223c 1 Myr) and massive (\u223c 100 M\u2299 ) EMP\nmodel can reproduce the observed colours of one line-offset\nLAE as well as the LAEs without offset (Figure 12a). A\nPop III model (\u223c 1 Myr and \u223c 100 M\u2299 ) can reproduce all\nbut one LAEs discussed here (Figure 12b). The last LAE\n(object d) shows the largest offset between NB359 position\nand Ly\u03b1, thus, the possibility of a foreground contamination in NB359 is the highest. Finally, we conclude that the\nPop III model is the most favourable stellar population for\nthe LyC emitting LAEs although the EMP model may be\nstill compatible. If we consider a combination of two stellar\npopulations, 'primordial' and 'normal' sub-solar metallicity\nwith dust, the UV two-colour diagram of all the LAEs and\nLBGs can be well explained (Figure 13). In this case, the\nmass fraction of the 'primordial' stars is estimated to be\n0.1\u201310% or more for LAEs with V \u2212 i\u2032 < 0.3, a few 0.1%\nfor LAEs with V \u2212 i\u2032 > 0.3 (but these may be foreground\ncontamination), and 0.01\u20131 % for LBGs, depending on the\nage of the galaxies, dust content, and IGM attenuation (Figure 13). We also note that the LBGs can be explained by\nnormal stellar populations and EMP or Pop III stars are not\nmandatory for them.\nThe Lyman 'bump' galaxies presented in this paper is a\nnew population of high-z galaxies. Indeed, they were missed\nin standard 'drop-out' surveys because they are not 'dropout' but have an excess flux in LyC: Lyman 'bump'. Because\nwe started from a sample selected based on a narrowband\nexcess by the Ly\u03b1 emission line, we did find another excess\nin LyC. However, Steidel, Pettini, & Adelberger (2001) and\nShapley et al. (2006) started from a LBG sample, i.e. 'dropout' sample, and thus, they could not find any galaxies with\na Lyman 'bump'. This new population of galaxies probably\n\n\fLyman 'bump' galaxies\nPhase-I\n(first assembly)\nfilament Pop-III\n\nPop-III\nPop-III\nPop-III\n\nPhase-II: LAEs with LyC?\n(initial metal enrichment)\nPop-III\n\ndust shell\n\nPop-III\n\nsub-solar\nmetallicity\nPop-III\n\nPhase-III: LBGs with LyC?\n(late infall)\nPop-III\n\nsub-solar\nmetallicity,\ndust\n\nFigure 14.

Therefore, starting from a LAE sample selected by a narrowband would be the best to sample the Lyman 'bump' galaxies. On the other hand, if all the LAEs had\nLyman 'bump', i.e. no 'drop-out', LAEs and LBGs would\nseparate well. However, a significant fraction of LBGs overlap with LAEs in fact (e.g., Shapley et al. 2003; Noll et al.\n2004; Verhamme et al. 2008). This may imply that the fraction of LAEs having Lyman 'bump' is small although the\nIGM attenuation may play a role to hide the Lyman 'bump'\nand to make 'drop-out'.\nA caveat is the lack of the confirmation of the Lyman\nlimit 'bump' in spectroscopy. Our argument of finding the\nLyman limit 'bump' is only based on narrowband photometry. We should confirm the feature in spectroscopy in future.\n\n6.1\n\nA possible evolutionary scenario of Lyman\n'bump' galaxies\n\nThe model with two stellar populations shown in Figure 13\nsimultaneously reproduces the strength of the Lyman limit\n'bump' and non-ionizing UV slope of the LAEs and LBGs\ndetected in LyC by I09. In the model, we have assumed\nthat a primordial stellar population which is dust-free coexists with 'normal' stars with sub-solar metallicity and dust.\nWe here discuss a possible scenario which may justify this\nassumption. Figure 14 shows a schematic picture of the scenario.\nThe hierarchical structure formation scenario argues that a galaxy is assembled from many subgalactic\n\n15\n\nminihaloes. Cosmological hydrodynamics simulations have\nshown that the galaxy assembly occurs through cosmic filaments and galaxies reside at nodes of the filaments (e.g.,\nBromm et al. 2009). Greif et al. (2008) examined the first\ngalaxy assembly at z \u223c 10 and found that in a 5 \u00d7 107\nM\u2299 halo, \u223c 10 very massive metal-free stars, so-called Population III.1, were formed before the assembly. As a radiative feedback by the Pop III.1 stars, pristine gas which\nwas ionized once by the Pop III.1 stars can be more abundant in H2 and HD than before, cool more efficiently, and\nform intermediate-mass metal-free stars, so-called Population III.2 (e.g., Yoshida et al. 2007). As a result, Greif et al.\n(2008) expected that gas infalling onto the central part of\na galaxy in the potential well likely forms Pop III.2 during\nthe assembly if the gas remains primordial. The Pop III.1\nand III.2 stars emit intense LyC which produces cosmological H ii and He iii regions. The escape fraction of LyC is\nexpected to be very high (60\u201390%; Kitayama et al. 2004;\nYoshida et al. 2007) and the nebular LyC can make a significant Lyman limit 'bump' (Phase-I).\nWhile very massive Pop III.1 may become blackhole directly and make no contribution to the metal enrichment,\nPop III.2 stars will end their life with core-collapse supernovae (SNe) and enrich surrounding gas with metal (e.g.,\nHeger et al. 2003). At the same time, dust grains are also\nformed by the SNe (e.g., Nozawa et al. 2003). The metal and\ndust enrichment starts from the central part of the galaxy\nwhere the mode of star formation changes into the 'normal' mode (e.g., Schneider et al. 2006). If the multiple SNe\nblast waves make a supershell which contains dust grains,\nthe dust attenuation becomes a screen geometry in which\nthe dust attenuation law is determined only by dust optical\nproperties. If the dust properties resemble the SMC which\nis also making an intense star formation, the reddening law\nhas a steep wavelength dependence like the SMC extinction\nlaw which is assumed in the upper panel of Figure 13. On\nthe other hand, primordial gas and Pop III stars may be\nstill infalling onto the galaxy from the IGM. These infalling\nprimordial stars can make a significant Lyman limit 'bump'\n(Phase-II).\nAs the star formation proceeds in the main part of the\ngalaxy, dust and metal are mixed well in the ISM. In such\na medium, the wavelength dependence of the dust attenuation law becomes weak and expected to be similar to the\nCalzetti law (Fischera, Dopita, & Sutherland 2003; Inoue\n2005) which is assumed in the lower panel of Figure 13.\nEven in this late stage, a small portion of the surrounding\nIGM may remain primordial if the metal enrichment in the\nIGM is not efficient. The primordial gas may form Pop III\nstars during its infalling process through a cosmic filament\n(Phase-III).\nWith this scenario, we can explain the two-colour diagram as follows; the LAEs correspond to the Phase-II (or\npossibly Phase-I). If the age of the galaxies is 10\u2013100 Myr,\nthe primordial mass fraction is \u223c 1\u201310% or more in some\ncases. The amount of the dust attenuation for the underlying population is E(B \u2212 V ) = 0\u20130.3. The LBGs correspond\nto the Phase-III because of their relatively large stellar mass\n(\u223c 1010\u221211 M\u2299 ). If the age is 100\u20131,000 Myr, the primordial\nmass fraction is < 1% and typically \u223c 0.1%. The amount of\nthe dust attenuation is E(B \u2212V ) = 0\u20130.3 which is similar to\n\n\f16\n\nA. K. Inoue et al.\n\nLAEs but the attenuation laws may be different from each\nother.\nWe can also explain another observational fact: spatial displacements of LyC and non-ionizing UV of the LBGs\nfound in I09. As shown in Fig. 2 of I09, LyC detected position coincides with a substructure found in the periphery of the main component of the LBGs, although some of\nthese LyC emitting spots might be foreground contaminations (Vanzella et al. 2010a). In our scenario, we expect that\nprimordial stars emitting LyC exist in the periphery of the\ngalaxies (see also Tornatore et al. 2007). This is exactly the\nfinding from the LBGs by I09. We also expect that LAEs\nshow a smaller offset between LyC and non-ionizing UV than\nLBGs. According to I09, the offsets of the LAEs are not significant, and thus, smaller than those found in the LBGs.\nAgain, this is consistent with our scenario.\nOn the other hand, we have found another spatial displacement between continuum including LyC and Ly\u03b1 emission line in some LAEs. While these continua may not come\nfrom the LAEs but from foreground objects, the probability\nthat all the LAEs with line offset have a foreground contamination is very low as seen in \u00a74.2.2. We have also proposed\na possible mechanism to produce such a line offset in \u00a74.2.3:\nthe LAEs are composed of several unresolved substructures\nwhich have different Ly\u03b1 EWs. This mechanism may fit in\nour scenario as follows: in the Phase-II, the continuum including LyC comes from substructures in the periphery and\nLy\u03b1 emission comes from the dusty central component, because the Ly\u03b1 transmission can be higher than the continuum transmission if the dust is confined in clumps in the\nsupershell (Neufeld 1991).\n6.2\n\nPrimordial stars at z \u223c 3 and intergalactic\nmetal enrichment\n\nMassive (\u223c 100 M\u2299 ) EMP or Pop III stars exist in z \u223c 3\nLAEs if our interpretation is correct. Since these primordial stars are short-lived (a few Myr) because of their mass,\npristine gas should remain to form them until z \u223c 3.\nThis argument is not consistent with a scenario of global\nmetal enrichment by Pop III stars at very early epoch\n(Mackey, Bromm, & Hernquist 2003), in which the entire\nuniverse was enriched to a metallicity floor as Z > 10\u22123 Z\u2299\nby Pop III stars at z > 20. On the other hand, recent studies\nsuggest inhomogeneous metal enrichment in the IGM and an\nextended epoch of Pop III star formation as described below.\nObservations of metal absorbers in high-z QSO spectra\nshow that metal enrichment in Ly\u03b1 forest is inhomogeneous\n(Simcoe, Sargent, & Rauch 2004; Becker, Rauch, & Sargent\n2009). For example, Simcoe et al. (2004) show that \u223c 30%\nof lines of sight at z \u223c 2.5 have metallicity lower than the\ndetection limit of Z \u223c 10\u22123 Z\u2299 . Cosmological hydrodynamics simulations also show that metal enrichment in the IGM\nproceeds in a very inhomogeneous way and that a significant\nvolume in the IGM remains pristine until a lower redshift\n(Tornatore et al. 2007; Oppenheimer, Dav\u00e9, & Finlator\n2009; Trenti, Stiavelli, & Shull 2009; Wiersma et al. 2009;\nMaio et al. 2010). For example, Oppenheimer et al. (2009)\nshow that only \u223c 1% volume in the IGM is enriched to\nZ > 10\u22123 Z\u2299 by z = 5. Therefore, IGM metal enrichment\nis likely to proceed in a patchy way and we can expect a\nsignificant chance to form EMP or metal-free stars from\n\npristine materials kept until z \u223c 3 (Tornatore et al. 2007;\nJohnson 2010). In this sense, our argument of the discovery\nof EMP or metal-free stars at z \u223c 3 is consistent with\nrecent studies of IGM metal enrichment.\nThe LAEs which may contain primordial stars reside\nin a massive proto-cluster region, SSA22 field (Steidel et al.\n1998; Hayashino et al. 2004). This field is very peculiar in\nan enhanced activity of LAEs/LABs (M04), dusty submm galaxies (Tamura et al. 2009), and AGNs (Lehmer et al.\n2009). Such activities may proceed IGM metal enrichment efficiently by metal-rich outflows which are observed\nubiquitously around LBGs (Steidel et al. 2010). On the\nother hand, the LAEs' clustering in this field is very low\n(Hayashino et al. 2004) and this indicates that the LAEs\ndo not lie in the high density peak of the proto-cluster\nbut in the less dense periphery of the large-scale filaments\n(Shimizu et al. 2007). The metal enrichment may not proceed well yet there. However, the exact three-dimensional\ndistribution of the LAEs and other types of galaxies by\nspectroscopy is not obtained yet and is an interesting future work.\n\n6.3\n\nImplications for ionizing background and\nreionization\n\nThe existence of massive EMP or Pop III stars in LAEs\nmay have an impact on the studies of ionizing background\nand reionization. Based on the observed cosmic evolution\nof ionizing background, Inoue, Iwata, & Deharveng (2006)\nhave suggested higher LyC emissivity (or escape fraction)\nof galaxies at higher-z. Such an evolving LyC emissivity\nis supported by galactic LyC observations (Shapley et al.\n2006; Siana et al. 2010; Bridge et al. 2010) and simulations\n(Razoumov & Sommer-Larsen 2006, 2010) and is favourable\nfor the cosmic reionization (Bolton & Haehnelt 2007). On\nthe other hand, the physical mechanism of the evolving LyC\nemissivity is still uncertain. Some radiative transfer simulations suggest that less massive galaxies have larger escape fraction of LyC (Razoumov & Sommer-Larsen 2010;\nYajima, Choi, & Nagamine 2010). Vanzella et al. (2010c)\nhave found a possible luminosity dependence of the LyC\nemissivity from a large LBG sample. If such less massive\ngalaxies are common at higher-z, the global LyC emissivity\nbecomes larger at higher-z. Another possibility is that galaxies at higher-z have a higher mass fraction of massive EMP\nor Pop III stars and their LyC emissivity is intrinsically\nhigher. In \u00a75.5, we have found that more than an order of\nmagnitude larger primordial mass fraction in the LAEs (1\u2013\n10%) than the LBGs (0.1%). If this larger primordial mass\nfraction is true for general LAEs and the LAE population is\nmore common at higher-z as found by Ouchi et al. (2008),\nthe galactic LyC emissivity becomes higher at higher-z. Of\ncourse, these two scenarios can be combined: the less massive\nLAE population has larger intrinsic LyC emissivity due to\nprimordial stars and larger escape fraction. Indeed, to make\na strong Lyman 'bump', we need a large escape fraction of\n\u223c 0.5 (Paper I). Therefore, such less massive Lyman bump\ngalaxies may play a significant role in the cosmic reionization\nat z > 6.\n\n\fLyman 'bump' galaxies\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe are grateful to Jean-Michel Deharveng for suggestions,\ndiscussions, and encouragements, to Hisanori Furusawa for\ncooperation in the Subaru observations (S07B-010), and\nto Eros Vanzella, Masami Ouchi, Masao Mori, Hidenobu\nYajima, Masakazu Kobayashi, Hiroshi Shibai, and Toru\nTsuribe for discussions and comments.
