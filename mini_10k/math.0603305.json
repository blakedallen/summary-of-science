MINASYAN\nAbstract. We characterize relatively hyperbolic groups whose reduced\nC \u2217 -algebra is simple as those, which have no non-trivial finite normal subgroups.\n\n1. Introduction\nLet G be a countable discrete group. We denote by l2 (G) the Hilbert space\nof square-summable complex-valued functions on G and by B(l2 (G)) the algebra\nof bounded operators on l2 (G). The group G acts on l2 (G) by means of the left\nregular representation:\n\u03bb(g)f (h) = f (g \u22121 h), g, h \u2208 G, f \u2208 l2 (G).\nThe reduced C \u2217 -algebra Cr\u2217 (G) of G is the operator norm closure of the linear span\nof the set of operators {\u03bb(g) | g \u2208 G} in B(l2 (G)). It has a unit element and\nthe canonical trace \u03c4 : Cr\u2217 (G) \u2192 C, given by \u03c4 (1) = 1 and \u03c4 (\u03bb(g)) = 0 for all\ng \u2208 G \\ {1}. This C \u2217 -algebra reflects analytic properties of the group G. It plays\nan important role in non-commutative geometry and, via K-theory, in the BaumConnes conjecture [22].\nWe say that the group G is C \u2217 -simple if its reduced C \u2217 -algebra is simple, that\nis, it has no non-trivial two-sided ideals.\nIn 1975 Powers established the C \u2217 -simplicity of non-abelian free groups [21].\nLater, many other examples of C \u2217 -simple groups were found. These include nontrivial free products [20], torsion-free non-elementary Gromov hyperbolic groups\n[13, 15] (more generally, torsion-free non-elementary convergence groups [14]), centerless mapping class groups and outer automorphism groups of free groups [5],\nmany irreducible Coxeter groups [11], etc. A nice overview of C \u2217 -simple groups can\nbe found in [14].\nThe C \u2217 -simplicity can be regarded as a strong form of non-amenability: if G is\nboth amenable and C \u2217 -simple then G is reduced to one element [14]. It is a classical\nresult that the existence of free subgroups in the group implies non-amenability. In\n[2], Bekka, Cowling and de la Harpe introduced the following \"free-like\" property\nfor finite subsets of a group:\nDefinition. A discrete group G is said to have property Pnai if for any finite subset\nF of G \\ {1} there exists an element g0 \u2208 G of infinite order such that for each\nf \u2208 F , the subgroup hf, g0 i of G, generated by f and g0 , is canonically isomorphic\nto the free product hf i \u2217 hg0 i.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification.

Relatively Hyperbolic Groups, reduced group C \u2217 -algebras.\nThis work was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation Grant \u266f PP002-68627.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nG. ARZHANTSEVA AND A. MINASYAN\n\nThis property guarantees that Cr\u2217 (G) is simple and has a unique normalized\ntrace [2]. Recall that a normalized trace on a C \u2217 -algebra A with unit is a linear\nmap \u03c3 : A \u2192 C such that \u03c3(1) = 1, \u03c3(a\u2217 a) \u2265 0, and \u03c3(ab) = \u03c3(ba) for all a, b in A.\nIn the present article our main goal is to characterize C \u2217 -simple relatively hyperbolic groups. The class of relatively hyperbolic groups, that is, groups hyperbolic\nwith respect to appropriate collections of subgroups, is very large. It includes Gromov hyperbolic groups and many other examples. For instance, if M is a complete\nRiemannian finite\u2013volume manifold of pinched negative sectional curvature, then\n\u03c01 (M ) is hyperbolic with respect to the cusp subgroups [4, 10]. More generally,\nif G acts isometrically and properly discontinuously on a proper hyperbolic metric\nspace X so that the induced action of G on \u2202X is geometrically finite, then G is\nhyperbolic relative to the collection of maximal parabolic subgroups [4]. Groups\nacting on CAT (0) spaces with isolated flats are hyperbolic relative to the collection\nof flat stabilizers [16]. Algebraic examples of relatively hyperbolic groups include\nfree products and their small cancellation quotients [19], and fully residually free\ngroups (or Sela's limit groups) [7].\nThe notion of a relatively hyperbolic group was originally suggested by Gromov\n[12] and since then it has been investigated from different points of view [4, 10, 9, 8].\nWe use a general approach suggested by Osin in [19] (see the next section for details)\nwhich, when applied to finitely generated groups, is equivalent to those elaborated\nby Bowditch [4] and Farb (with the \"bounded coset penetration\" condition) [10].\nEvery non-elementary group G which is hyperbolic relative to a collection of\nproper subgroups, or NPRH group1 for brevity, has a maximal finite normal subgroup denoted by EG (G) [1, Lemma 3.3]. The quotient G/EG (G) is again a NPRH\ngroup [1, Lemma 4.4]. The main result of this paper is the following\nTheorem 1. Let G be a non-elementary group hyperbolic relative to a collection\nof proper subgroups {H\u03bb }\u03bb\u2208\u039b . If EG (G) = {1} then G satisfies the property Pnai .\nCorollary 2. Let G be a NPRH group. Then the following are equivalent.\n(i) The reduced C \u2217 -algebra of G is simple;\n(ii) The reduced C \u2217 -algebra of G has a unique normalized trace;\n(iii) G has infinite conjugacy classes2;\n(iv) G does not have non-trivial finite normal subgroups.\nProof. A discrete C \u2217 -simple group can not have a non-trivial amenable normal\nsubgroup [3, Prop. 2]. A similar argument shows the same for a discrete group\nwhose the reduced C \u2217 -algebra has a unique normalized trace [3, Prop. 2]. Evidently, a group with infinite conjugacy classes contains no non-trivial finite normal\nsubgroups. Therefore each of the properties (i) \u2013 (iii) implies (iv).\nSuppose, now, that (iv) holds. Then Theorem 1 and the result of Bekka-Cowlingde la Harpe [2] mentioned above imply (i) and (ii). Property (iii) follows from (i)\nas noted in [14].\n\u0003\nObserve that a C \u2217 -simple group is icc but the converse is not true in general as\nthere exist amenable icc groups. However, it is an open problem to find a group G\n1This refers to a non-elementary properly relatively hyperbolic group. A group is elementary\nif it has a cyclic subgroup of finite index.\n2A group G has infinite conjugacy classes, or, shortly, is icc, if it is infinite and if all its\nconjugacy classes distinct from {1} are infinite. A group G is icc if and only if the von Neumann\nalgebra W \u2217 (\u0393) is a factor of type II1 [17, Lemma 5.3.4].\n\n\fRELATIVELY HYPERBOLIC GROUPS ARE C \u2217 -SIMPLE\n\n3\n\nsuch that Cr\u2217 (G) is simple with several normalized tracial forms, or a group such\nthat Cr\u2217 (G) has a unique normalized trace and is not simple [3, Prop. 2].\nEvery non-elementary Gromov hyperbolic group is a NPRH group with respect\nto the family consisting of the trivial subgroup. Therefore Corollary 2 also describes\nall C \u2217 -simple Gromov hyperbolic groups.\nRecall that any countable group G has a maximal normal amenable subgroup\nRa (G)\u22b3G called the amenable radical of G. Corollary 2 together with the existence\nof a maximal finite normal subgroup, imply that for any NPRH group G, the\nquotient G/EG (G) is C \u2217 -simple. Since Ra (G/EG (G)) = Ra (G)/EG (G) it follows\n(see [3, Prop. 2]) that Ra (G) = EG (G). We have just obtained\nCorollary 3. The amenable radical of a NPRH group G coincides with its maximal finite normal subgroup EG (G) and the quotient G/EG (G) is C \u2217 -simple with a\nunique normalized trace.\nThus, a NPRH group G is C \u2217 -simple if and only if its amenable radical is reduced\nto one element. It is worth noticing that it is not yet known whether there exists\na countable group G whose amenable radical is trivial but G is not C \u2217 -simple [14,\nQuestion 4].\nEasy examples of C \u2217 -simple NPRH groups include non-abelian fully residually\nfree groups mentioned above [7]. Indeed, since non-abelian free groups satisfy the\nproperty Pnai in an obvious way, a standard argument3 shows the same for G.\nThis method, however, can not be applied to prove Theorem 1, because there exist\nC \u2217 -simple NPRH groups which are not fully residually hyperbolic (more generally,\nwhich are not which are not limits of Gromov hyperbolic groups in the space of\nmarked groups \u2013 see [6] for the definitions). As an example one can take a free\nproduct S \u2217 Z, where S is an infinite finitely presented simple group.\nAcknowledgments.

Relatively hyperbolic groups and their properties\nLet G be a group, {H\u03bb }\u03bb\u2208\u039b a fixed collection of subgroups of G (called peripheral\nsubgroups), X a subset of G. We say that X is a relative generating set of G with\nrespect to {H\u03bb }\u03bb\u2208\u039b if G is generated by X together with the union of all H\u03bb . In\nthis situation the group G can be considered as a quotient of the free product\nF = (\u2217\u03bb\u2208\u039b H\u03bb ) \u2217 F (X),\nwhere F (X) is the free group with the basis X. Let R be a subset of F such that\nthe kernel of the natural epimorphism F \u2192 G is the normal closure of R in the\ngroup F ; we say that G has relative presentation\n(1)\n\nhX, {H\u03bb }\u03bb\u2208\u039b | R = 1, R \u2208 Ri.\n\n3Consider a finite subset F \u2282 G \\ {1}. By the assumptions, there exist a non-abelian free\ngroup H and a homomorphism \u03c6 : G \u2192 H such that \u03c6(F ) \u2282 H \\ {1}. Any subgroup of a free\ngroup is free itself, hence we can suppose that \u03c6 is surjective. As H satisfies the property Pnai ,\nwe can choose h \u2208 H so that for every f \u2208 F , the elements \u03c6(f ) and h freely generate a free\nsubgroup H \u2032 \u2264 H of rank 2. Choose an arbitrary preimage g0 of h in G. For any f \u2208 F the\nrestriction of \u03c6 to the subgroup hf, g0 i is an isomorphism with H \u2032 , because a non-trivial element\nin its kernel would yield a non-trivial relation between the images \u03c6(f ) and \u03c6(g0 ) = h. Thus,\nhf, g0 i \u223c\n= hf i \u2217 hg0 i, and G satisfies the property Pnai .\n\n\f4\n\nG. ARZHANTSEVA AND A. MINASYAN\n\nIf the sets X and\nF R are finite, the relative presentation (1) is said to be finite.\nDefine H = \u03bb\u2208\u039b (H\u03bb \\ {1}). A finite relative presentation (1) is said to satisfy a\nlinear relative isoperimetric inequality if there exists C > 0 such that, for every word\nw in the alphabet X \u222a H (for convenience, we assume further on that X \u22121 = X)\nrepresenting the identity in the group G, one has\nw =F\n\nk\nY\n\nfi\u22121 Ri\u00b11 fi ,\n\ni=1\n\nwith the equality in the group F , where Ri \u2208 R, fi \u2208 F , for i = 1, . . . , k, and\nk \u2264 Ckwk, where kwk is the length of the word w.\nThe group G is called relatively hyperbolic with respect to a collection of peripheral\nsubgroups {H\u03bb }\u03bb\u2208\u039b , if G admits a finite relative presentation (1) satisfying a linear\nrelative isoperimetric inequality. This definition is independent of the choice of the\nfinite generating set X and the finite set R in (1) (see [19]).\nFor a combinatorial path p in the Cayley graph \u0393(G, X \u222a H) of G with respect\nto X \u222a H, we denote by p\u2212 , p+ and kpk the initial point, the end point and the\nlength correspondingly. We will write elem(p) for the element of G represented\nby the label of p. Further, if \u03a9 is a subset of G and g belongs to the subgroup\nh\u03a9i \u2264 G generated by \u03a9, then |g|\u03a9 will denote the length of a shortest word in \u03a9\u00b11 ,\nrepresenting g.\nSuppose q is a path in \u0393(G, X \u222a H). Using the terminology from [19], a subpath\np is called an H\u03bb \u2013component (or, simply, a component) of q, if the label of p is a\nword in the alphabet H\u03bb \\ {1} for some \u03bb \u2208 \u039b, and p is not contained in a longer\nsubpath of q with this property.\nTwo components p1 , p2 of a path q in \u0393(G, X \u222a H) are called connected if they\nare H\u03bb \u2013components for the same \u03bb \u2208 \u039b and there exists a path c in \u0393(G, X \u222a H)\nconnecting a vertex of p1 to a vertex of p2 whose label entirely consists of letters\nfrom H\u03bb . In algebraic terms, this means that all vertices of p1 and p2 belong to\nthe same coset gH\u03bb for a certain g \u2208 G. We can always assume c to have length at\nmost 1, as every non-trivial element of H\u03bb is included in the set of generators of G.\nAn H\u03bb \u2013component p of a path q is called isolated if no other H\u03bb \u2013component of q\nis connected to p.\nThe next statement is often useful in the study of relatively hyperbolic groups.\nLemma 4 ([19], Lemma 2.27). Suppose that a group G is hyperbolic relatively\nto a collection of subgroups {H\u03bb }\u03bb\u2208\u039b . Then there exist a finite subset \u03a9 \u2286 G\nand a constant K \u2265 0 such that the following condition holds.

The following description of elementary subgroups in a relatively\nhyperbolic group was obtained by Osin.\n\n\fRELATIVELY HYPERBOLIC GROUPS ARE C \u2217 -SIMPLE\n\n5\n\nLemma 5 ([18], Thm. 4.3, Cor. 1.7). Let G be a group hyperbolic relatively to a\ncollection of subgroups {H\u03bb }\u03bb\u2208\u039b . Let g be a hyperbolic element of infinite order of\nG. Then the following conditions hold.\n(1) The element g is contained in a unique maximal elementary subgroup EG (g)\nof G; moreover,\nEG (g) = {f \u2208 G : f \u22121 g n f = g \u00b1n for some n \u2208 N}.\n(2) The group G is hyperbolic relative to the collection {H\u03bb }\u03bb\u2208\u039b \u222a {EG (g)}.\nA significant restriction on the choice of peripheral subgroups is described in the\nlemma below.\nLemma 6 ([19], Thm. 1.4). Suppose that a group G is hyperbolic relative to a\ncollection of subgroups {H\u03bb }\u03bb\u2208\u039b . Then\n(a) For any g \u2208 G and any \u03bb, \u03bc \u2208 \u039b, \u03bb 6= \u03bc, the intersection H\u03bbg \u2229 H\u03bc is finite.\n(b) For any \u03bb \u2208 \u039b and any g \u2208\n/ H\u03bb , the intersection H\u03bbg \u2229 H\u03bb is finite.\n3. Proof of the main result\nThroughout this section we assume that G is a non-elementary group hyperbolic\nrelatively to a family of proper subgroups {H\u03bb }\u03bb\u2208\u039b .\nLemma 7. Let g \u2208 G be a hyperbolic element of infinite order satisfying EG (g) =\nhgi. Then there exists N \u2208 N such that for any n \u2265 N and \u03bb \u2208 \u039b, the subgroup\nhH\u03bb , g n i \u2264 G is canonically isomorphic to the free product H\u03bb \u2217 hg n i.\nProof. By Lemma 5, G is hyperbolic relatively to the collection {H\u03bb }\u03bb\u2208\u039b \u222a hgi.\nLemma 4 provides a finite subset \u03a9 of G and a constant K > 0 corresponding to\nthis new family of peripheral subgroups. Since the order of g is infinite, there exists\nN \u2208 N such that\n(2)\n\ngm \u2208\n/ {y \u2208 h\u03a9i : |y|\u03a9 \u2264 8K} provided |m| \u2265 N.\n\nFix n \u2265 N and \u03bb \u2208 \u039b. Suppose, by the contrary, that the subgroup of G,\ngenerated by H\u03bb and hg n i, is not canonically isomorphic to their free product.\nThen there exist k \u2208 N, l1 , . . . , lk \u2208 nZ \\ {0} and x1 , . . . , xk \u2208 H\u03bb \\ {1} such that\nx1 g l1 x2 g l2 * * * xk g lk =G 1.\n\nF\nDefine H\u2032 = \u03bb\u2208\u039b (H\u03bb \\ {1}) \u2294 (hgi \\ {1}). Consider the cycle q = p1 p2 . . . p2k\nin the Cayley graph \u0393(G, X \u222a H\u2032 ), where elem(p1 ) = x1 , elem(p2 ) = g l1 , . . . ,\nelem(p2k\u22121 ) = xk , elem(p2k ) = g lk and kpi k = 1, i = 1, . . . , 2k.\nSuppose, at first, that there are two hgi-components ps and pt of q, 2 \u2264 s <\nt \u2264 2k, which are connected. Then there exists a path u between (pt )\u2212 and (ps )+ ,\nlabelled by an element from hgi (in particular, kuk = 1). Without loss of generality,\nwe may assume that (t \u2212 s) is minimal.\nConsider the cycle o = ps+1 . . . pt\u22121 u in \u0393(G, X \u222a H\u2032 ). If t = s + 2, then\nelem(ps+1 ) = elem(u\u22121) \u2208 H\u03bb \u2229hgi = {1} (by Lemma 6), which would contradict to\nthe choice of q. Hence t \u2265 s+4 and ps+2 , ps+4 , . . . , pt\u22122 are isolated hgi-components\nof o. Applying Lemma 4 to the cycle o, we achieve elem(ps+2 ), . . . , elem(pt\u22122 ) \u2208 h\u03a9i\nand\n|elem(ps+2 )|\u03a9 + * * * + |elem(pt\u22122 )|\u03a9 \u2264 Kkok = K(t \u2212 s).\n\n\f6\n\nG. ARZHANTSEVA AND A. MINASYAN\n\nSince elem(ps+2 ), . . . , elem(pt\u22122 ) \u2208 hg n i \\ {1}, we can use the formula (2) to obtain\nt\u2212s\u22122\nt\u2212s\n8K\n\u2264 K(t \u2212 s), consequently 4 \u2264\n\u2264 3.\n2\nt\u2212s\u22122\nA contradiction.\nTherefore all hgi-components of q have to be isolated. Applying Lemma 4 to\nthe cycle q leads to a contradiction by the same argument as before. Thus, the\nstatement is proved.\n\u0003\nEach NPRH group has a hyperbolic element of infinite order [18, Cor. 4.5],\ntherefore we can use the following simplification of Lemma 3.8 from [1]:\nLemma 8. Every NPRH group G contains a hyperbolic element g of infinite order\nsuch that EG (g) = hgi \u00d7 EG (G).\nProof of Theorem 1. Consider an arbitrary finite subset F = {f1 , . . . , fm } of G.\nFor every i, if fi \u2208 F is an element of finite order, then we can include the finite\nsubgroup hfi i in the collection of peripheral subgroups {H\u03bb }\u03bb\u2208\u039b , preserving the relative hyperbolicity of G (for instance, by the characterization of all \"hyperbolically\nembedded subgroups\" obtained in [18, Thm. 1.5]). If f \u2208 F is a hyperbolic element of infinite order, we use Lemma 5 to include the elementary subgroup EG (f )\nin {H\u03bb }\u03bb\u2208\u039b . Thus, further on, we can assume that for each i \u2208 {1, . . . , m} there\nexist \u03bbi \u2208 \u039b and hi \u2208 G such that\n(3)\n\nhfi i \u2264 hi H\u03bbi h\u22121\ni .\n\nSince EG (G) = {1} by the assumptions, we can apply Lemma 8 to find a hyperbolic element g \u2208 G of infinite order such that EG (g) = hgi. Therefore the elements\ngi = h\u22121\ni ghi satisfy the assumptions of Lemma 7, thus there exist Ni \u2208 N such that\nthe subgroup hH\u03bbi , gini i \u2264 G is canonically isomorphic to the free product of H\u03bbi\nand hgini i for each ni \u2265 Ni and i = 1, . . . , m. Set n = max{Ni | i = 1, . . . , m}.\nFormula (3) and the definition of gi imply that the subgroup hfi , g n i of the group\nG is isomorphic to the free product hfi i \u2217 hg n i for every i = 1, . . . , m. Hence G\nsatisfies the property Pnai .\n\u0003\nReferences\n[1] G. Arzhantseva, A. Minasyan, D.
