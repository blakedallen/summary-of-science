At the same time, they\nare capable of producing highly collimated jets of energy and particles flowing out of the\nsystem with relativistic velocities2 . Here we show that the 10 solar mass black hole in the Xray binary Cygnus X-13,4,5 is surrounded by a large-scale (about 5 pc in diameter) ring-like\nstructure that appears to be inflated by the inner radio jet6 . We estimate that in order to\nsustain the observed emission of the ring, the jet of Cygnus X-1 has to carry a kinetic power\nthat can be as high as the bolometric X-ray luminosity of the binary system. This result\nmay imply that low-luminosity stellar mass black holes as a whole dissipate the bulk of the\nliberated accretion power in the form of 'dark', radiatively inefficient relativistic outflows,\nrather than locally in the X-ray emitting inflow.\n1\n\n\fRelativistic jets are a common feature of accreting black holes on all mass scales, from\nsuper-massive black holes at the centres of active galactic nuclei7,8 to stellar mass black holes\nin X-ray binary systems within our own Galaxy9,10,11 . While the inflow of hot gas can be very\nefficient in producing light (up to \u223c 40 per cent of the accreted material may be transformed into\nenergy and radiated away in the form of optical/UV/X-ray photons) the same is not true for for the\nsynchrotron-emitting outflow, whose efficiency might be lower than a few per cent. Estimating the\ntotal \u2013 radiated plus kinetic \u2013 power content of the jets, and hence their importance with respect to\nthe accretion process in terms of energetics, is a primary aim of high energy astrophysics.\n\nWe observed the field of the 10 solar mass black hole and Galactic jet source Cygnus X-1\nat 1.4 GHz for 60 hours with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT), yielding the\ndeepest low frequency radio observation of that region to date12 . A ring of radio emission \u2013 with\na diameter of \u223c1 million AU \u2013 appears northeast of Cygnus X-1 (Figure 1), and seems to draw an\nedge between the tail of the nearby HII nebula Sh2-10113 (whose distance is consistent with that\nto Cygnus X-114 ) and the direction of the radio jet powered by Cygnus X-16 . Since Cygnus X-1\nmoves in the sky along a trajectory which is roughly perpendicular to the jet15,6,16 , and thus can not\npossibly be traced back to the ring centre, this rules out that the ring might be the low-luminosity\nremnant of the natal supernova of the black hole. In analogy with extragalactic jet sources, the\nring of Cygnus X-1 could be the result of a strong shock that develops at the location where\nthe collimated jet impacts on the ambient interstellar medium (Figure 2). The jet particles inflate a\nradio lobe which is over-pressured with respect to the surroundings, thus the lobe expands sideways\nforming a spherical bubble of shock-compressed ISM, which we observe as a ring because of\n2\n\n\flimb brightening effects. The collisionally ionized gas behind the bow shock would produce the\nobserved bremsstrahlung radiation; in addition, if the shock is radiative, significant line emission\nis expected from hotter gas at the bow shock front. Structures similar to the ring of Cygnus X-1\nhave been found at the edges of radio lobes inflated by the jets of super-massive black holes at\nthe centre of powerful radio galaxies17 , where the much higher temperatures of the intra-cluster\nmedium compared to the ISM shift the bremsstrahlung emission to X-ray frequencies. Striking\nconfirmation of this interpretation comes from follow-up optical observations of the field of Cygnus\nX-1 with the Isaac Newton Telescope Wide Field Camera: the ring is clearly detected using a H\u03b1\nfilter in an exposure of only 1200 sec (Figure 3). The estimated flux of the ring at H\u03b1 frequencies\n> 20, indicating that the collisionally ionized gas\nexceeds the measured radio flux by a factor \u223c\n\nin the ring is indeed emitting bremsstrahlung radiation and also that a significant amount of the\nmeasured H\u03b1 flux is due to line emission, as expected in the case of radiative shock.\n\nActing as an effective jet calorimeter, the ISM allows an estimate of the jet's power\u00d7lifetime\nproduct18 that is, in principle, independent of the uncertainties associated with the jet spectrum and\nradiative efficiency. Following a self-similar fluid model developed for extragalactic jet sources19,20,21 ,\nwe assume that the jet of Cygnus X-1 is supplying energy at a constant rate Pjet , and is expanding in\n> 104\na medium of constant density. We set the minimum temperature of the thermal gas to Tshock \u223c\n\nK, a typical temperature above which the cooling time becomes critically short, and below which\nthe ionization fraction becomes too low for the ring to emit observable bremsstrahlung radiation.\nGiven the average ring monochromatic luminosity, we are able to estimate a density of about 1300\ncm\u22123 for the shock-compressed particles in the ring from the expression for the bremsstrahlung\n3\n\n\femissivity22,23 . By balancing the interior pressure exerted by the lobe and the ram pressure of the\nshocked ISM, it can be shown20 that the jet length within the lobe grows with the time t in such\na way that: t \u2243 (L/2)(5/3) \u00d7 (\u03c10 /Pjet )(1/3) , being L the separation between Cygnus X-1 and the\nring's outermost point, and \u03c10 the mass density of the un-shocked gas. By writing the time derivative of this equation, there follows a simple relation between the jet lifetime, its length within the\nlobe, and the ring velocity: t =\n\n3\n(L/vring ).\n5\n\nFor a strong shock in a mono-atomic gas, the ex-\n\npansion velocity is set by the temperature of the shocked gas. If the shock is radiative, then the\ninitial post-shock temperature can be higher than that of the thermalized, bremsstrahlung-emitting\ngas. A stringent constraint comes from X-ray observations: from the non-detection of soft X-ray\nemission in a 12 ksec observation of Cygnus X-1 taken with the Chandra X-ray Observatory, we\n< 3 \u00d7 106 K by modelling the emission as a radiative shock.\ncan place an upper limit of Tshock \u223c\n\nThis, combined with the lower limit of 104 K, gives a ring velocity vring \u2243 20 \u2212 360 km sec\u22121 .\nThe resulting jet lifetime is t \u2243 0.02 \u2212 0.32 Myr, to be compared with the estimated age of the\nprogenitor of the black hole in Cygnus X-1, of a few Myr16 .\n\nAdopting a mass density of the un-shocked gas that is 4 times lower than the initial postshock density, we infer a time-averaged energy emission rate from the jet between 8 \u00d7 1035 and\n1037 erg sec\u22121 . Based upon daily X-ray and radio monitoring of Cygnus X-1 over the last 10 years,\nwe know that Cygnus X-1 is in a hard X-ray state24 \u2013 and hence powers a collimated jet11 \u2013 for\nabout 90 per cent of its lifetime. Taking this duty cycle into account, the total power carried by\n37\n\u22121\n< P\n<\nthe jet of Cygnus X-1 is: 9 \u00d7 1035 \u223c\njet \u223c 10 erg sec , up to two orders of magnitude higher\n\nthan the existing estimate based on the flat radio spectrum25 . The fact that the jet of Cygnus X-1\n4\n\n\fswitches off for short periods of times (typically for a few months over timescales of years) does\nnot violate the model assumptions: the condition of constant power supply is met as long as the jet\nis intermittent over timescales that are short compared to its lifetime. The total power carried by\nthe jet is a significant fraction f \u2243 0.03 \u2212 0.5 of the bolometric (0.1-200 keV) X-ray luminosity\nof Cygnus X-1 while in the hard state26 ; the total energy deposited by the jet into the surrounding\nISM over its lifetime is \u2243 7 \u00d7 1048 erg.\n\nThe particle density of the ISM through which the ring is expanding is constrained between\n\u223c 1 and about 300 cm\u22123 , at most three orders of magnitude higher than the average ISM density\nin the Galaxy. The lack of a 'counter-ring' can be explain in terms of a much lower particle density\nin the opposite direction to Cygnus X-1. Such large density inhomogeneities are not unusual for\ndense star forming regions, such as the Cygnus association, and would support the hypothesis that\nthe ring is the result of the interaction between the radio lobe and the tail of the HII nebula. If\nso, the counter-jet of Cygnus X-1 is travelling undisturbed to much larger distances, gradually\nexpanding and releasing its enormous kinetic energy. This could mean that the ring of Cygnus X-1\nis a rather exceptional detection for this class of objects, made possible by its proximity to the HII\nnebula. Taking into account the contribution of the counter-jet as well, the total power dissipated\nby the jets of Cygnus X-1 in the form of kinetic energy can be as high as the bolometric X-ray\nluminosity of the system (f = 0.06 \u2212 1).\n\nThe results presented here have important consequences for low-luminosity stellar mass\nblack holes as a whole: several works27,28,29 have suggested that hard state stellar black holes\n\n5\n\n\fbelow a critical X-ray luminosity dissipate most of the liberated gravitational power in the form of\nradiatively inefficient outflows, rather than locally in the accretion flow. This is because in hard\nstate black hole binaries the total jet power and the observed X-ray luminosity follow a non-linear\nrelation30 of the form Pjet \u221d LX0.5 (both expressed in Eddington units). Using the ring of Cygnus\nX-1 as an effective calorimeter for the jet power, we have constrained the normalization factor of\nthe above equation, showing that Pjet = f LX , with f \u2243 0.06 \u2212 1, when LX \u2243 0.02. Thus the critical X-ray luminosity below which Pjet > LX is no lower than a few 10\u22125 Eddington, and could\neven be as high as the peak luminosity of the hard X-ray state. This radically alters our concepts\nof the accretion process and of the feedback of accretion power into the surroundings. Via the new\nobservations presented here we have strong evidence that the power output of low-luminosity \u2013 i.e.\nthe overwhelming majority of \u2013 stellar black holes is dominated by the kinetic energy of 'dark'\noutflows, whose key signature is the eventual energisation of the ambient medium.\n\n1.

The Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope is operated by the ASTRON (Netherlands Foundation for Research in Astronomy) with support from the Netherlands Foundation for Scientific\nResearch (NWO).\n\n10\n\n\f11\n1 arcmin (2 light years)\n\nF (Jy)\n\u03bd\n\n\fFigure 1: The interstellar gas around a Galactic stellar black hole is stirred by the pressure of\na highly collimated relativistic jet of energy and particles, resulting in a 15 light-years wide ring\nof radio emission. The field of view of the 10 solar mass black hole in Cygnus X-1 (marked by\na cross) was observed by the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope for 60 hours at 1.4 GHz:\nthe ring appears to draw an edge between the tail of Sh2-101, the nearby HII nebula on the left\nhand side, and the direction of the inner radio jet of Cygnus X-1 (shown in the inset of Figure 2).\nThe spatial resolution in this map (25 \u00d7 14 arcsec2 ) is illustrated by the green open ellipse on the\ntop right corner. The wedge shows the (logarithmic) flux scale, between 0\u20130.01 Jy; the average\nring monochromatic flux is 0.2 mJy beam\u22121 . At a distance of 2.1 kpc, the separation L between\nCygnus X-1 (coincident with the jet base) and the ring's outermost point is 1.9 \u00d7 1019 \u00d7sin(\u03b8)\u22121\ncm, where \u03b8 is the jet inclination to the line of sight (\u03b8 \u2243 35\u25e6[5] ). Because of limb-brightening,\nwe observe a ring whose thickness \u2206R in the plane of the sky equals the effective length we are\nlooking through into the bubble. At 2.1 kpc, \u2206R \u2243 1.6 \u00d7 1018 cm.\n\n12\n\n\fbow shock front\n\nbremsstrahlung\ngas\n\nsynchrotron\nlobe\n\ncollimated jet\n\n13\n\n\fFigure 2: The ring of Cygnus X-1 is the result of a strong shock that develops at the location where\nthe pressure exerted by the collimated milliarcsec-scale jet, shown in the inset, is balanced by\nthe interstellar medium. The jet particles start to inflate a synchrotron-emitting lobe which is overpressured with respect to the surrounding gas, thus the lobe expands sideways forming a spherical\nbubble of shock-compressed bremsstrahlung-emitting gas. The monochromatic luminosity of the\nring, L1.4 GHz \u2243 1018 erg sec\u22121 Hz\u22121 , equals the product (\u01eb\u03bd \u00d7 V ), where the source unit volume\nV is given by the beam area times the measured ring thickness: V \u2243 4 \u00d7 1053 cm3 , and \u01eb\u03bd is the\nexpression of the bremsstrahlung emissivity for a pure hydrogen gas emitting at a temperature\nT : \u01eb\u03bd = 6.8 \u00d7 10\u221238 g(\u03bd, T ) T (\u22121/2) n2e exp(h\u03bd/kB T ) erg cm\u22123 sec\u22121 Hz\u22121 (being h and kB the\nPlank and Boltzmann's constant, respectively). For T \u2243 104 K and a Gaunt factor g \u2243 6, the\ndensity ne of the ionized particles in the ring is ne \u2243 25 cm\u22123 . The ionization fraction at 104 K is\nx \u2243 0.02[23] , resulting in a total particle density nt \u2243 1300 cm\u22123 . The minimum pressure inside\nthe lobe predicted by the model is \u2243 5 \u00d7 10\u221211 erg cm\u22123 . If this pressure is solely due to a\nmagnetized relativistic pair plasma in equipartition, then the strength of the magnetic field is about\n40 \u03bcG. Assuming minimum energy conditions22 , this yields an expected lobe synchrotron surface\nbrightness of \u2243 35 mJy beam\u22121 at 1.4 GHz, more than 150 times brighter than the observed ring.\nThe much lower upper limit for the lobe surface brightness means that either the system is far from\nequipartition, or the most of the energy is stored in non-radiating particles, presumably baryons.\n\n14\n\n\f15\n\n\fFigure 3: Optical counter-part of the radio ring of Cygnus X-1. The optical image, taken with the\nIsaac Newton Telescope Wide Field Camera using an H\u03b1 filter, is shown with the 3\u03c3 radio contours over-plotted in white. As no calibration was taken during the observation, an absolute flux\nscale can not be set; however, given that the ring is clearly detected in a 1200 sec exposure, and\ntaking into account the atmospheric and sky conditions during the observation, this translates into\na minimum unabsorbed H\u03b1 flux of 0.02 mJy arcsec\u22122 . The corresponding radio-optical spectral\nindex a (defined such that F\u03bd \u221d \u03bd a ) is greater than 0.2. This implies an emission mechanism with\nflat spectrum, such as bremsstrahlung, plus excess flux possibly due to line emission, as expected\nin the case of radiative shock. For comparison, if the ring emitted optically thin synchrotron radiation with a spectral index a = \u22120.7, the expected flux at H\u03b1 frequencies would be 1.2 10\u22127 mJy\narcsec\u22122 , by no means detectable by the INT WFC in 1200 sec.\n\n16\n\n\f"}
