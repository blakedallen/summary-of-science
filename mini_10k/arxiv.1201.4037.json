[3\u20135]). Modification of gravity is an alternative approach to dark energy paradigm\nto explain the cosmic accelerated expansion [3\u20137]. There have been proposed, for example,\nf (R) model [8\u201312], Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) model [13], and the galileon model [14].\nIn general, it is very challenging to construct a viable model that explains the late-time\naccelerated expansion of the background universe, satisfying the local gravity constraints\nwithout theoretical plague simultaneously.\nThe DGP model is described in the context of the braneworld scenario, which consists of\na 3+1-dimensional brane embedded in a 5-dimensional bulk. This model has an interesting\nphenomenology, which yields two branches of the Friedmann equation, a self-accelerating\nbranch (sDGP) and a normal branch (nDGP). In the sDGP branch, the expansion of the\nbackground universe self-accelerates at late times without a cosmological constant, while the\nnDGP branch needs to add a stress-energy component with negative pressure on the brane\nto be consistent with cosmological observations [15, 16]. Unfortunately, the sDGP model\ninevitably gives rise to a ghost [17, 18]. Moreover, the sDGP model is disfavored by the\ncosmological observations [19\u201321].\nInspired by the decoupling limit of the DGP model [17, 22], the galileon gravity theory\nhas been studied as a possible alternative to large distance modification of gravity (e.g., [14,\n23\u201333]). This theory introduces a scalar field invariant under the Galilean shift symmetry\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n\f\u2202\u03bc \u03c6 \u2192 \u2202\u03bc \u03c6 + b\u03bc in the Minkowski space-time, which keeps the equation of motion being the\nsecond order differential equation. Although the Lagrangian no longer satisfies the Galilean\nshift symmetry in a curved spacetime, one can construct the generalized galileon model whose\nfield equation remains a second order differential equation, which simultaneously admits the\nself-accelerating solution in a FRW universe without a ghost instability [34\u201336].\nIn general, the gravitational force and the gravitational potential are modified on the\nscales of cosmology as a result of the modification of gravity. However, the solar system\nobservations require that Newtonian gravity is recovered on those scales [37]. There have\nbeen proposed a few successful screening mechanisms depending on modified gravity models,\ne.g., the chameleon mechanism [38\u201340], the symmetron [41, 42], and the Vainshtein mechanism [43]. One of the notable features of the galileon gravity is the Vainshtein mechanism,\nwhich hides the scalar field to recover Newtonian gravity in high-density regions. In the\nVainshtein mechanism, the self-interaction term like (\u2202\u03c6)2 \u0003\u03c6 plays an important roll. Due\nto the nonlinear interaction, the scalar field is suppressed in high-density regions, hence it is\nscreened there. Thanks to this screening mechanism, the galileon gravity models can evade\nthe solar-system constraints [14] (c.f. [44]).\nIt is worth examining whether the screening mechanism works completely or not around\nhigh-density regions on cosmological scales. The structure of halos of galaxy and cluster of\ngalaxies may be useful to test these modified gravity models. Recently, several researchers\nhave investigated such a possibility of testing these modified gravity models on the scales\nof halos of galaxy and cluster of galaxies [45\u201357]. In [58], the authors have investigated a\nconstraint on the Vainshtein mechanism in the context of the massive gravity, using gravitational lensing and velocity dispersion data from galaxies. In a recent work, we investigated\nhow the transition in the Vainshtein mechanism may appear in the sDGP model and the\ngalileon model [54]. We found that the circular speed of a test particle in the sDGP and\nthe galileon model deviates from that in Newtonian gravity at 10% level on the outer region\nof a halo with the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) density profile (e.g., [59, 60]). Thus the\nVainshtein mechanism might not completely hide the effect of the modified gravity on the\ncluster's scales.\nThe purpose of the present paper is to investigate how the transition in the Vainshtein\nmechanism in a subclass of the generalized galileon model appears in an observation of a\nhalo density profile measured through the gravitational lensing phenomena. We consider\na subclass of the most general second-order scalar-tensor theory [34\u201336, 61], in which the\nscalar field modifies the equation connecting the lensing potential and the matter density.\nIn this model, the observational quantities measured through the lensing phenomena are\ncontaminated by the scalar field's effect, which might leave testable signatures in observed\nhalos. Then, we focus our investigation on the signature of the modified gravity by comparing\ntheoretical predictions and observations.\nMany works have been done for testing gravity on cosmological scales using, for example,\nthe large scale structures of galaxies and the redshift-space distortions (e.g., [62\u201367]), and\nthe integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect through cross-correlations between the cosmic microwave\nbackground temperature anisotropies and the galaxy distributions (e.g., [68]). The cluster\nabundance (e.g., [69]) provides a test of gravity on rather smaller scales, but it reflects the\nregime of the linear evolution of density perturbations substantially. On smaller scales, other\ntests of deviation from general relativity have been done [70\u201374, 78]. A halo of cluster of\ngalaxies provides a unique chance to test the gravity theory on the scale between the solarsystem and the large scale structure of galaxies, where the nonlinear effect of the density\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n\fperturbations plays an important role.\nIn the present paper, we focus our investigation on the surface mass density of cluster\nhalo measured with gravitational lensing. Cluster lensing surveys are in progress, which\nis useful to obtain mass distribution of clusters over a wide range of radius by combing\nstrong and weak lensing data. Recently, measurements of the surface mass density were\nreported using the gravitational lensing [56, 75\u201377]. The error of the stacked data is small,\nwhich is useful to test the modified gravity as will be demonstrated below. Umetsu et al.\nderived a mean surface mass profile of four clusters, A1689, A1703, A370, and Cl0024+17,\nfrom Hubble Space Telescope and Subaru images, in the range R = (40 \u2212 2800)h\u22121 kpc\nat the mean lensing redshift hzl i = 0.32 [75, 76]. They obtained mass profiles with highprecision, by combining independent strong-lensing measurements, weak-lensing distortion,\nand magnification. Oguri et al. presented the mass distribution of a sample of 25 galaxy\nclusters, in the range R = (63 \u2212 5010)h\u22121 kpc at the mean lensing redshift hzl i = 0.47 and\nthe mean source redshift hzs i = 1.1 [77]. The cluster sample is based on the Sloan Giant\nArcs Survey (SGAS) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). They derived the differential\nsurface mass density by combining the strong lensing information from the giant arcs and\nweak lensing measurements from Subaru/Suprime-Cam [79] images. Umetsu et al. and Oguri\net al. fit the data within the general relativity, and they found that the NFW profile favors\nthe data.\nWe confront the observed surface mass density of clusters with the theoretical prediction\nof the modified gravity model endowed with the Vainshtein mechanism. In the theoretical\nmodeling, we introduce the parameters \u03bc and \u01eb, respectively, which characterize the amplitude and the typical radius of the transition in the Vainshtein mechanism. We obtain\nconstraints on \u03bc and \u01eb. This demonstrates the usefulness of the surface mass density to\nconstrain the modified gravity model.\nThe structure of this paper is as follows. In section 2, we derive our basic theoretical\nformulas in a subclass of the generalized galileon modified gravity to compare with observational quantities from gravitational lensing. In section 3, we scrutinize the theoretical\nbehavior of the surface mass density profile depending on familiar density profiles. In section\n4, we present the results of the confrontation between the theoretical predictions and the observational results, which derive constraints on the model parameters \u03bc and \u01eb characterizing\nthe modification of gravity. In section 5, we discuss about the results and our interpretations. Section 6 is devoted to summary and conclusions. In appendix A, we summarize the\ndefinitions of the coefficients in the perturbation equations in section 2. In appendix B, we\nsummarize the coefficients in the perturbation equations in the original galileon model.\nThroughout this paper, we use units in which the speed of light equals unity, and\nwe follow \u221a\nthe convention (\u2212, +, +, +). We use the reduced Planck mass MPl , defined by\nMPl = 1/ 8\u03c0G with Newton's gravitational constant G. We adopt the Hubble constant\nH0 = 100 hkm/s/Mpc with h = 0.702, and the matter density parameter at present \u03a90 =\n0.275 [80].\n\n2\n2.1\n\nFormulation\nModified gravity model\n\nThe most general second-order scalar-tensor theory was derived by Horndeski [34] for the\nfirst time, which was recently rediscovered by Deffayet et al. [35] as the most generalized\ngalileon theory, which contains four arbitrary functions of the functions of \u03c6 and X =\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\n\f\u2212g\u03bc\u03bd \u2207\u03bc \u03c6\u2207\u03bd \u03c6/2. The Vainshtein mechanism in the generalized galileon theory is discussed\nrecently [44], which clarified variety of the solutions of the scalar field in the generalized\ntheory. We here consider a subclass of the general second-order scalar-tensor theories in a\ncurved spacetime, which is nonminimally coupled to gravity with the action [61],\n\u0015\n\u0014\nZ\n1\n4 \u221a\nS = d x \u2212g F (\u03c6)R + K(\u03c6, X) \u2212 G(\u03c6, X)\u0003\u03c6 + Lm ,\n(2.1)\n2\nwhere K(\u03c6, X) and G(\u03c6, X) are the arbitrary functions of \u03c6 and X, F (\u03c6) is the function\nof \u03c6, and Lm is the matter Lagrangian. We assume that the matter fields do not have\ndirect couplings with the field \u03c6. This corresponds to the Lagrangian with G4 = F (\u03c6)/2\nand G5 = 0 in the most general galileon model [36]. The action reduces to the kinetic\n2 [29, 33]. The original galileon model is\ngravity braiding model, for the choice F (\u03c6) = MPl\n2 , K(\u03c6, X) = \u2212X and G(\u03c6, X) = (r 2 /M )X, where r\nreproduced by choosing F (\u03c6) = MPl\nc\nPl\nc\nis the parameter [29].\nIn this subsection, we summarize the perturbation equations for gravity and the scalar\nfield in the cosmological background. In reference [44], the Vainshtein mechanism in the most\ngeneral second-order scalar-tensor theory was investigated. The model in the present paper\n(2.1), a subclass of the most general second-order scalar-tensor theory, was also investigated\ntherein. Following [44], we choose the Newtonian gauge,\nds2 = \u2212(1 + 2\u03a8(t, x))dt2 + a(t)2 (1 + 2\u03a6(t, x))\u03b4ij dxi dxj ,\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhere a(t) is the scale factor. Within the subhorizon scales with the quasi-static approximation, we have the following perturbed equations,\n\u25b3\n\u25b3\n\u03a6 = \u22124\u03c0G\u03b4\u03c1 + \u03be 2 \u03c6,\n2\na\na\n\u03a6 + \u03a8 = \u2212\u03b1\u03c6,\n\n(2.3)\n(2.4)\n\nand\n\u25b3\n\u03c6 + \u03bb2\na2\n\n\u03c6,ij \u03c6,ij\n\u2212\na2 a2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u00132 !\n\u25b3\n= \u22124\u03c0G\u03b6\u03b4\u03c1,\n\u03c6\na2\n\n(2.5)\n\nwhere \u03c6(x) denotes the perturbation of scalar field defined by \u03c6(t, x) = \u03c6(t)(1 + \u03c6(x)),\n\u25b3 represents the Laplace differentiation operator, \u03b4\u03c1 is the perturbed matter density, the\nNewton's gravitational constant is defined by G \u2261 1/(8\u03c0F (\u03c6)), and the coefficients \u03b1, \u03be, \u03b6,\nand \u03bb2 depend on the functions F (\u03c6), K(\u03c6, X), and G(\u03c6, X), whose explicit expressions are\nsummarized in appendix A.\nThe above equations are derived as follows (see [44] for details). We consider the gravitational and scalar fields on subhorizon scales sourced by a non-relativistic matter density\nperturbation \u03b4\u03c1. Then, we may ignore time derivative in the field equations, while keeping\nspatial derivatives. Denoting the quantities for perturbations \u03a8, \u03a6 and \u03c6 by V, we keep all\nthe terms (\u2202 2 V)n with n \u2265 1, because the L2 (t)\u2202 2 V could be large on small scales, where\nL(t) is a typical length scale associated with the background evolution which may be as large\nas the Hubble radius. Within this framework, it has been shown that the terms (\u2202 2 V)n with\nn \u2265 2 do not appear in the gravitational field equations (2.3) and (2.4) for our model (2.1).\nBut only the terms of (\u2202 2 V)2 appear in the scalar field equation (2.5).\n\n\u20134\u2013\n\n\fNote that the coefficients \u03b1, \u03be, \u03b6, and \u03bb2 are determined by the background field evolution depending on F (\u03c6), K(\u03c6, X), and G(\u03c6, X). The coefficients may take any value because\nF (\u03c6), K(\u03c6, X), and G(\u03c6, X) are arbitrary functions of \u03c6 and X. We should choose F (\u03c6),\nK(\u03c6, X), and G(\u03c6, X) requiring the accelerated expansion of the universe and satisfying the\nconditions of no ghost nor instability, which will limit the arbitrary functions. However,\nwe here assume that \u03b1, \u03be, \u03b6, and \u03bb2 may take any value reflecting the arbitrariness of the\nfunctions in the model, and consider the constraint from observation through gravitational\nlensing.\nCombining (2.3) and (2.4), we have\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03b1 + 2\u03be \u25b3\n\u25b3 \u03a8\u2212\u03a6\n\u03c6.\n(2.6)\n= 4\u03c0G\u03b4\u03c1 \u2212\n2\na\n2\n2 a2\nIn the spherically symmetric case, (2.5) yields\n!\nr\n8G\u03bb2 \u03b6M (r)\nd\u03c6\nr\n= 2 1\u2212 1+\n,\ndr\n4\u03bb\nr3\n\n(2.7)\n\nRr\nwhere we defined the enclosed mass M (r) = 4\u03c0 0 dr \u2032 r \u20322 \u03b4\u03c1(r \u2032 ).

In the original galileon\nmodel, we have non-zero values of \u03bb2 \u03b6 and (\u03b1 + 2\u03be)\u03b6/2 (see appendix B). On the other hand,\nin the model of the sDGP model, we have \u03b1 = \u22121 and \u03be = 1/2, then (\u03b1 + 2\u03be)\u03b6/2 reduces to\nzero, while \u03bb2 \u03b6 takes a non-zero value.1 Therefore, in the sDGP model, the relation between\nthe lensing potential (\u03a6 \u2212 \u03a8)/2 and the matter density perturbation (2.6) is the same as that\nin the general relativity. In this case, our method cannot put a constraint because there is\nno effect of the modified gravity on the gravitational lensing in such a class of models.\nIn order to obtain the closed system of equations, we need another equation for the\nmatter density perturbation \u03b4\u03c1. Because we are considering the model in which the matter is\nminimally coupled with the scalar field, the matter component follows the usual equation under the influence of the gravitational potential \u03a8. Instead of specifying the coupled equations\nof \u03b4\u03c1 and \u03a8, we simply assume the NFW density profile or other well-known profiles for the\nmatter density perturbation \u03b4\u03c1 (cf. [54]). From N-body simulations in reference [46], it is suggested that the NFW profile describes the density profile of halos in the DGP model though\nthe parameters of the profiles are scaled. This is a supporting evidence of our assumption in\nthe present paper.\n2.2\n\nGravitational lensing in modified gravity\n\nNow let us consider observational quantities observed through gravitational lensing. The light\npropagation in the Newtonian gauge (2.2) is described by the lensing potential (\u03a6 \u2212 \u03a8)/2.\n1\n\nIn the spatially flat sDGP model, we have \u03bb2 \u03b6 = 2(rc /3\u03b2)2 , where rc = 1/[(1 \u2212 \u03a9m )H0 ] and \u03b2 =\n1 \u2212 2Hrc (1 + \u1e22/3H 2 ).\n\n\u20135\u2013\n\n\fFor example, the convergence \u03ba(\u03c7) of the gravitational lensing is given by (e.g., [81, 82])\nZ\n1 \u03c7 \u2032 fK (\u03c7 \u2212 \u03c7\u2032 )fK (\u03c7\u2032 ) (2D)\n\u03ba\u2243\u2212\n\u25b3\n(\u03a6 \u2212 \u03a8),\n(2.9)\nd\u03c7\n2 0\nfK (\u03c7)\nwhere fK (\u03c7) is the comoving angular diameter distance and \u25b3(2D) is the comoving two\ndimensional Laplacian. Note that fK (\u03c7) = \u03c7 for the spatially flat universe. The shear can\nbe written in a similar form with (2.9). It is worthy to note that any quantity of gravitational\nlensing is described by the lensing potential.\nUsing the thin lens approximation, (2.9) and (2.6) yield\n\u0015\n\u0014\nZ\nfK (\u03c7S \u2212 \u03c7L )fK (\u03c7L ) \u03c7S \u2032\n\u03b1 + 2\u03be \u25b3\n\u2032\n\u03ba\u2243\n\u03c6 a2L ,\n(2.10)\nd\u03c7 4\u03c0G\u03c1(r ) \u2212\nfK (\u03c7S )\n2 a2L\n0\nwhere \u03c7S is the comoving distance between the observer and the source, \u03c7L is the comoving\nradial distance between the observer and the lens object, and aL is the scale factor at which\nwe observe the lens object. We define the observed surface mass density, which is obtained\nthrough the gravitational lensing phenomena,\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ \u03c7S\n\u03b1 + 2\u03be \u25b3\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u03a3S = \u03a3crit\u03ba =\nd(aL \u03c7 ) \u03c1(r ) \u2212\n\u03c6 ,\n(2.11)\n8\u03c0G a2L\n0\nwhere \u03a3crit is defined by\n\u03a3crit =\n\nfK (\u03c7S )\n1\n.\n4\u03c0G fK (\u03c7L )fK (\u03c7S \u2212 \u03c7L )aL\n\n(2.12)\n\nWe introduce the spatial coordinate being the physical coordinate, whose origin is located at the center of the lens object by Z = aL (\u03c7 \u2212 \u03c7L ) and r\u22a5 = aL fK (\u03c7L )\u03b8, where \u03b8 is\nthe polar angle of the polar axis connecting the observer and the lens object. Then, using\n(2.8), the observed surface mass density (2.11) is written as\n!\nr\nZ \u221e \u0014\n8G\u03bb2 \u03b6M (r)\n3(\u03b1 + 2\u03be)\ndZ \u03c1(r) \u2212\n1\u2212 1+\n\u03a3S (r\u22a5 ) = 2\n32\u03c0G\u03bb2\nr3\n0\n\u0015\n(\u03b1 + 2\u03be)\u03b6 4\u03c0r 3 \u03c1(r) \u2212 3M (r)\nq\n+\n,\n(2.13)\n2\n8\u03c0\n(r)\nr 3 1 + 8G\u03bb r\u03b6M\n3\nq\n2 + Z 2.\nwhere r = r\u22a5\n2.3\n\nParametrization of the modified gravity\n\nTo investigate the constraint on the modified gravity model on the halo scales, we introduce\nthe parameters \u03bc and \u01eb as follows, which characterize the modification of gravity,\nq\n(\u03b1 + 2\u03be)\u03b6\n,\n\u01eb = H02 \u03bb2 \u03b6.\n\u03bc=\n(2.14)\n2\nWith these two parameters the surface mass density (2.13) is written as\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\ns\n!\nZ \u221e\n2\n3\n2\n3H0 \u03bc\n\u03bc 4\u03c0r \u03c1(r) \u2212 3M (r) \uf8fb\n8G\u01eb M (r)\nq\ndZ \uf8f0\u03c1(r) \u2212\n\u03a3S (r\u22a5 ) = 2\n.\n1\u2212 1+\n+\n2\n2\n3\n16\u03c0G\u01eb\n4\u03c0 r 3 1 + 8G\u01eb2 M (r)\nH0 r\n0\nH02 r 3\n\n(2.15)\n\n\u20136\u2013\n\n\fThe physical meaning of \u03bc and \u01eb is understood as follows. In the limit of large r, (2.8) and\n(2.6) reduce to\n3G\u03b6M (r)\n\u25b3\n\u03c6\u2243\u2212\n,\na2\nr3\n\n(2.16)\n\n\u0012\n\n(2.17)\n\nand\n\u25b3\na2\n\n\u03a8\u2212\u03a6\n2\n\n\u0013\n\n\u2243 4\u03c0Geff \u03b4\u03c1,\n\nrespectively, where Geff = G(1 + \u03bc) is the effective gravitational constant in the linearized\nlimit. Thus \u03bc is the amplitude of the modification of gravity in the outer region of a halo in\nthe linearized regime. On the other hand, in the limit of small r, (2.7) gives\nr\n8G\u03bb2 \u03b6M (r)\nd\u03c6\n1\nGM (r)\nd\u03a8\nd\u03a6\n\u2243 2\n\u226a\n,\n.\n(2.18)\n\u223c\n2\ndr\n4\u03bb\nr\nr\ndr\ndr\nThis means that the effect of the scalar field is screened due to the nonlinear interaction of\nthe scalar field in the limit of small r, which is the Vainshtein mechanism. Hence, the basic\nequations (2.3), (2.4) and (2.6) reduce to those of general relativity when the scalar field is\nneglected.\nThus, the modified gravity effect appears in the linear regime at large radii, while the\nmodified gravity effect is screened due to the nonlinear effect at small radii. The transition\nradius between the two regime is the Vainshtein radius rV , which we defined by (cf. [33, 54])\n\u0002\n\n2\n\nrV \u2261 8G\u03bb \u03b6Mvir\n\n\u00031/3\n\n8G\u01eb2 Mvir\n=\nH02\n\u0014\n\n\u00151/3\n\n,\n\n(2.19)\n\nwhere Mvir is the virial mass of a cluster (see below). Therefore, \u01eb is the parameter of the\nVainshtein radius rV . In summary, Newtonian gravity is recovered due to the Vainshtein\nmechanism for r \u226a rV , while the gravity is modified for r \u226b rV . The Vainshtein radius is\nrewritten as\n\u0012\n\u00131/3\nMvir\n2/3\nrV = 13.4\u01eb\nh\u22121 Mpc.\n(2.20)\n1015 M\u2299\nIn the limit \u03bc \u2192 0 or \u01eb \u2192 \u221e, Newtonian gravity is reproduced on all scales. The original\ngalileon model corresponds to \u03bc = 0.26 and \u01eb = 0.53 (\u03bc = 0.19 and \u01eb = 0.43) at the redshift\n0.32 (0.47), respectively, which is the mean redshift of clusters of the observational data used\nbelow.\nFigures 1 and 2 demonstrate typical behavior of the surface mass density (left panel)\nand the logarithmic slope of the surface mass density (right panel) as a function of r\u22a5 . The\ncurves are the theoretical model parametrized by \u03bc and \u01eb, while the points with the error\nbars show the observational data by Umetsu et al. in [75, 76], which is obtained by averaging\nover four massive clusters. In figure 1, the theoretical curves assume the different values of \u03bc\nwith fixing \u01eb and the other parameters for the halo density profile, as described in the panels,\nwhere we assumed the NFW density profile (see the next section). This figure demonstrates\nhow the theoretical curve depends on \u03bc. As r\u22a5 becomes large, the amplitude of \u03a3S (r\u22a5 ) is\nenhanced for positive \u03bc, while it is suppressed for negative \u03bc. The (black) solid curve is\n\n\u20137\u2013\n\n\fNewtonian gravity, while the (magenta) dot and long-dashed curve is the original galileon\nmodel. Figure 2 is the same as figure 1 but with adopting the different theoretical values.\nHere the different values of \u01eb are assumed while \u03bc and the other parameters for the density\nprofile are fixed, as described in this figure. As \u01eb describes the Vainshtein radius rV , within\nwhich Newtonian gravity is recovered, \u03a3S (r\u22a5 ) deviates from Newtonian gravity even at small\nradii for small \u01eb (small rV ), while \u03a3S (r\u22a5 ) deviates from Newtonian gravity only at large radii\nfor large \u01eb (large rV ). For the case \u03bc < 0, \u03a3S (r\u22a5 ) deviates from the line of \u03bc = 0 in the\nopposite side of the case \u03bc > 0.\n\nFigure 1. Surface mass density \u03a3S (r\u22a5 ) (left panel) and the logarithmic slope d ln \u03a3S /d ln r\u22a5 (right\npanel) as function of r\u22a5 . The data with the error bar is from Umetsu et al. [75, 76], while the curves\nare the theoretical modeling. The (magenta) dot and long-dash curve is the original galileon model\n(\u03bc = 0.26, \u01eb = 0.53), but the other curves assume the same value of \u01eb = 0.1 but the different values\nof \u03bc = 1 (green dashed curve), 0 (black solid curve), and \u22120.5 (blue dot and short-dashed curve),\nrespectively. Note that \u03bc = 0 is Newtonian gravity. We here adopted the NFW profile with fixing\nMvir = 1.5 \u00d7 1015 M\u2299 /h and cvir = 7.7.\n\n3\n\nHalo density profiles and differential surface mass density\n\nThe halo density profile has been investigated as an important consequence of the cold dark\nmatter paradigm, which is a key component of the universe. Lots of works have been done\non the halo density profile with cosmological N-body simulations (e.g. [83\u201391]). The NFW\nuniversal profile [59, 60] is reported to work well, but the generalized NFW (gNFW) profile\nhas also been studied [92\u201394]. Some studies indicate that the Einasto profile [95] better fits\nthe inner cusps [96, 97, 99].\nFor predicting the surface mass density \u03a3S (r\u22a5 ), we need to determine the halo density\nprofile \u03c1(r). In the present paper, we adopt the halo density profiles described in this section,2\nwhose validity is suggested from N-body simulations. The halo density profiles could be\naffected by the modification of gravity, however, we adopt the same profile irrespective of\ngravity model, whose validity is partially suggested by N-body simulations for the DGP\nmodel and f (R) model [46, 51]. In this section, after briefly reviewing cold dark matter\n2\n\nWe only consider the contribution of the cluster halo profile itself (1-halo term) to \u03a3S (r\u22a5 ), and we neglect\nthe neighboring halos (2-halo term), which is only important at large r\u22a5 [94].\n\n\u20138\u2013\n\n\fFigure 2. Same figure as figure 1 but with different theoretical models. The black solid curve is\nNewtonian gravity \u03bc = 0, the other curves assume the same value of \u03bc = 1.0 and the different values\nof \u01eb = 0.1 (green dashed curve), 0.5 (blue dot short-dashed), and 1.0 (magenta dot long-dashed),\nrespectively. Note that the curves approach Newtonian gravity as \u01eb becomes large. We adopted the\nsame NFW profile as figure 1, Mvir = 1.5 \u00d7 1015 M\u2299 /h and cvir = 7.7.\n\nFigure 3. Surface mass density \u03a3S (r\u22a5 ) (left panel) and the logarithmic slope d ln \u03a3S /d ln r\u22a5 (right\npanel) as function of r\u22a5 . The data with the error bar is from Umetsu et al. [75, 76], while the curves\nare the theoretical models assuming Newtonian gravity \u03bc = 0 and the NFW profile with cvir = 7.7\nand Mvir = 1.0 \u00d7 1016 M\u2299 (green dashed), 1.5 \u00d7 1015 M\u2299 /h (black solid), and 1.0 \u00d7 1015 M\u2299 (blue\ndot-dashed), respectively.\n\n(CDM) halo density profiles (see e.g., [97]), we demonstrate how the observed surface mass\ndensity depends on the modified gravity. This indicates the potential ability of testing the\ngravity theory with the halo density profile.\n3.1\n\nNFW profile\n\nWe first consider the NFW profile [59, 60]\n\u03c1(r) =\n\n\u03c1s\n,\n(r/rs )(1 + r/rs )2\n\n\u20139\u2013\n\n(3.1)\n\n\fFigure 4.

The other parameters are fixed as Mvir = 1.5 \u00d7 1015M\u2299 /h, cvir = 7.7,\nand \u03bc = 0.\n\nwhere \u03c1s = 4\u03c1(rs ) is the characteristic density, rs is the characteristic radius where the\nslope of the density profile changes.

We take the value \u2206vir = 120. Note that the virial overdensity and the\ncritical density depend on the cosmological background, which we do not specify explicitly.\n\n\u2013 10 \u2013\n\n\fFigure 6.

The mass parameter is fixed Mvir = 1.5 \u00d7 1015 M\u2299 /h, and we assumed\nNewtonian gravity \u03bc = 0. For comparison, we also plot the NFW profile (black solid curve).\n\nHowever, when Mvir and cvir are marginalized over, the dependence on the cosmological\nbackground is not necessarily specified because it is absorbed by the redefinition of Mvir and\ncvir .\nFigure 3 shows the surface mass density \u03a3S (r\u22a5 ) (left panel) and its logarithmic slope\nd ln \u03a3S /d ln r\u22a5 (right panel), where we adopted the different values of Mvir with the other\nparameters fixed, which are described therein.

Figure 4 is the same figure as 3, but with adopting the different values of cvir and\nfixing the other parameter. Here we fixed the virial mass as Mvir = 1.5 \u00d7 1015 M\u2299 /h.

The mass parameter is fixed Mvir = 1.5 \u00d7 1015 M\u2299 /h, and we\nassumed Newtonian gravity \u03bc = 0. The black solid curve is the NFW profile.\n\nAs we will describe in the next section, we compare the theoretical model with observations by introducing the chi square statistics (see expression (4.1)). Within Newtonian\ngravity, the best-fit value of the chi-squared is 5.8 for 13 degrees of freedom (DOF), which\nwe find for Mvir = 1.6 \u00d7 1015 M\u2299 /h and cvir = 7.9.

For the\ngNFW profile, r\u22122 = rs (2 \u2212 \u03b3s )/(\u03b3l \u2212 2) and the corresponding concentration parameter is\nc\u22122 \u2261 rvir /r\u22122 = cvir (\u03b3l \u2212 2)/(2 \u2212 \u03b3s ).\nFigure 5 shows \u03a3S (r\u22a5 ) and d ln \u03a3S /d ln r\u22a5 adopting different values of \u03b3s with the other\nparameters fixed as \u03b3l = 3.0, Mvir = 1.5 \u00d7 1015 M\u2299 /h, cvir = 7.7, and \u03bc = 0. The effect of\nchanging \u03b3s appears only inside halo. Figure 6 is the same as figure 5, but with adopting the\ndifferent values of \u03b3l with the other parameters fixed as \u03b3s = 1.0, Mvir = 1.5 \u00d7 1015 M\u2299 /h,\ncvir = 7.7, and \u03bc = 0. The behavior of \u03a3S (r\u22a5 ) is similar to that of figure 4, which causes a\ndegeneracy in the parameter space. We find the best-fit value of the chi-squared \u03c72 /DOF =\n5.5/13 within Newtonian gravity for (\u03b3s , \u03b3l ) = (0.7, 2.8), using the surface mass density data\nin [76]. This value of the chi-squared is slightly better than the best-fit value \u03c72 /DOF =\n5.8/13 for the NFW profile with (\u03b3s , \u03b3l ) = (1, 3). The best-fit value for the gNFW profile\nwith (\u03b3s , \u03b3l ) = (1.1, 3.1) is \u03c72 /DOF = 6.2/13 within Newtonian gravity (see table 1).\n\u03b33D (r) \u2261 \u2212\n\n\u2013 12 \u2013\n\n\f2\n\n3\n\n2\n\n3\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n15\n\n14.5\nGR\nGalileon\n\n14\n\n0.1\n0.5\n1.0\n\n13.5\nOguri et al.

The panel (a) adopted\nthe gNFW profile with \u03b3s = 1.2 (green dashed curve), \u03b3s = 0.7 (blue dot-dashed curve), and \u03b3s = 1\n(black solid curve), respectively. The other parameters are fixed as \u03b3l = 3, Mvir = 4.6 \u00d7 1014 M\u2299 /h,\ncvir = 5.8, and \u03bc = 0. In this panel \u03b3s = 1 is equivalent to the NFW profile.

In this panel, we fixed \u03b3s = 1, then \u03b3l = 3 is equivalent to the NFW profile. The panel\n(c) adopted the Einasto profile, with \u0393 = 0.3 (green dashed curve), \u0393 = 0.23 (blue dot short-dashed\ncurve), and \u0393 = 0.17 (magenta dot long-dashed curve), respectively.

The authors in [88] claimed that CDM halos can be\nmore properly described by the Einasto profile than the NFW profile, using Millennium simulation. They also claimed that the best-fit value of \u0393 increases gradually with the increase\nof the virial mass, from \u0393 \u223c 0.16 for galaxy halos to \u0393 \u223c 0.3 for the most massive clusters.\nFigure 7 shows \u03a3S (r\u22a5 ) and d ln \u03a3S /d ln r\u22a5 with adopting different values of \u0393 but with\n\n\u2013 14 \u2013\n\n\fthe other parameters fixed r\u22122 = 0.26h\u22121 Mpc, Mvir = 1.5\u00d71015 M\u2299 /h, and \u03bc = 0. \u0393 changes\nthe slope and the amplitude of \u03a3S (r\u22a5 ) at large radii. Figure 8 is the same as figure 7 but\nwith varying r\u22122 with the other parameters fixed \u0393 = 0.23, Mvir = 1.5 \u00d7 1015 M\u2299 /h, and\n\u03bc = 0. The slope and the amplitude of \u03a3S (r\u22a5 ) strongly depend on r\u22122 .\nWe obtained the best-fit value of the chi-squared 9.9, 7.2, and 9.6 for 13 DOF for the\nEinasto profile with \u0393 = 0.17, 0.23, and 0.3, respectively (see table 1). Thus the Einasto\nprofile does not fit the observational data better than the NFW profile or the gNFW profile\nwithin Newtonian gravity.\n3.4\n\nDifferential surface mass density\n\nOguri et al. [77] obtained the differential surface mass density, which is defined by\n\u2206\u03a3+ (r\u22a5 ) \u2261 \u03a3crit g+ (r\u22a5 ),\n\n(3.7)\n\nwhere \u03a3crit is defined by (2.12), g+ (r\u22a5 ) is the reduced shear\n\u03b3+ (r\u22a5 )\n,\n1 \u2212 \u03ba(r\u22a5 )\n\ng+ (r\u22a5 ) \u2261\n\n(3.8)\n\nand the tangential shear is defined by\n\u03b3+ (r\u22a5 ) = \u03ba\u0304(< r\u22a5 ) \u2212 \u03ba(r\u22a5 ) =\n\n\u03a3\u0304S (< r\u22a5 ) \u2212 \u03a3S (r\u22a5 )\n,\n\u03a3crit\n\n(3.9)\n\nwith\n2\n\u03a3\u0304S (< r\u22a5 ) = 2\nr\u22a5\n\nZ\n\nr\u22a5\n\n\u2032\n\u2032 \u2032\n).\nr\u22a5 \u03a3S (r\u22a5\ndr\u22a5\n\n(3.10)\n\n0\n\nIn figures 9 and 10, we demonstrate the behavior of the differential surface mass density\n\u2206\u03a3+ (r\u22a5 ) as a function of r\u22a5 , comparing with the data in [77]. The panels (a), (b), (c) and\n(d) of figure 9 show how \u2206\u03a3+ (r\u22a5 ) depends on \u03bc, \u01eb, Mvir and cvir , respectively, adopting the\nNFW profile. The panels (a) and (b) of figure 10 show the dependence on \u03b3s and \u03b3l in the\ngNFW profile, while the panels (c) and (d) of figure 10 show the dependence on \u0393 and r\u22122 in\nthe Einasto profile, respectively. The behaviors are very similar to those of the surface mass\ndensity described in the above subsections.\nSimilar to the surface mass density, we compare the theoretical prediction with the\nobservational data by introducing the chi-squared, (4.8). We obtained the best-fit values of\nchi-squared for the NFW profile, the gNFW profile and the Einasto profile within Newtonian\ngravity as well as allowing the modified gravity, which are summarized in table 2. We find the\nbest-fit value of the chi-squared \u03c72 /DOF = 12.9/17 for the NFW profile within Newtonian\ngravity, with the best-fit parameter Mvir = 6.6 \u00d7 1014 M\u2299 /h and cvir = 6.1. This is consistent\nwith the result by Oguri et al. [77]. The best-fit parameter is given M\u0304vir = 4.6 \u00d7 1014 M\u2299 /h\n3 \u2206(z)\u03c1 (z).\nand c\u0304vir = 5.7, when we adopt the same definition for the virial mass M\u0304vir = 4\u03c0rvir\nm\nThe result is similar to that using the surface mass density in the point that the Einasto\nprofile with large value of \u0393 does not better fit the observational data than the NFW profile\nand the gNFW profile within Newtonian gravity. Thus the Einasto profile with \u0393 = 0.3 is\nnot favored within Newtonian gravity.\n\n\u2013 15 \u2013\n\n\fmodel\nNFW\ngNFW\ngNFW\nEinasto\nEinasto\nEinasto\n\nNewtonian\nMvir [M\u2299 ]\n2.2 \u00d7 1015\n2.2 \u00d7 1015\n2.2 \u00d7 1015\nMvir [M\u2299 ]\n2.5 \u00d7 1015\n2.2 \u00d7 1015\n1.9 \u00d7 1015\n\n(\u03b3s , \u03b3l )\n(1, 3)\n(0.7, 2.8)\n(1.1, 3.1)\n\u0393\n0.17\n0.23\n0.3\n\ngravity\ncvir (c\u22122 )\n7.9\n13.9(8.6)\n6.2(7.6)\nr\u22122\n0.30\n0.28\n0.26\n\n\u03c72GR\n5.8\n5.5\n6.2\n\u03c72GR\n9.9\n7.2\n9.6\n\nModified\nMvir [M\u2299 ]\n2.2 \u00d7 1015\n2.2 \u00d7 1015\n2.2 \u00d7 1015\nMvir [M\u2299 ]\n2.9 \u00d7 1015\n2.1 \u00d7 1015\n1.6 \u00d7 1015\n\ngravity\ncvir (c\u22122 )\n8.0\n13.9(8.6)\n6.3(7.7)\nr\u22122\n0.35\n0.26\n0.22\n\n\u03c72MG\n5.7\n5.5\n6.0\n2\n\u03c7MG\n8.7\n6.5\n5.6\n\nTable 1.

The region sandwiched between the\nsolid curves is the 1-sigma allowed region, and the point marked by the cross is the original\ngalileon model, \u03bc = 0.19 and \u01eb = 0.43 at the redshift z = 0.47. In the right panel of figure\n11, we adopted the NFW profile, and the best-fit value of the chi squared is noted in table 2\nas \u03c72MG .\nThe panels in figure 13 are the same as the right panel of figure 11, but with adopting\nthe different profiles. The panels (a) and (b) of figure 13 assume the gNFW profile with (\u03b3s ,\n\u03b3l ) = (0.7, 2.8) and (1.1, 3.1), while (c) and (d) adopt the Einasto profile with \u0393 = 0.17 and\n0.23, respectively. Note that the panel (d) indicates that the modified gravity is favored than\nNewtonian gravity when the Einasto profile with large \u0393 is assumed.\n\n5\n\nDiscussion\n\nOur main result is symbolically expressed by figure 11. From figure 11, Newtonian gravity,\ni.e., \u03bc = 0 or \u01eb \u226b 1, is favored, and the original galileon model is in the 1-sigma allowed\n< 1 when \u01eb < 1,\nregion, which is not rejected. One can see that the data put a constraint |\u03bc| \u223c\n\u223c\n< \u03bc < 0.6\nbut the constraint on \u03bc becomes weaker as \u01eb becomes larger. For instance, \u22120.4 \u223c\n\u223c\n< \u03bc < 2.5 for \u01eb = 1.0.\nfor \u01eb = 0.1 and \u22121.5 \u223c\n\u223c\nThe Vainshtein radius rV depends on \u01eb and Mvir , from eq. (2.19). The method in\nthe present paper cannot constrain the model in which the Vainshtein radius rV is larger\nthan the cluster scale because the effect of the modified gravity becomes very weak inside\n< 3 h\u22121 Mpc for the surface mass\nthe Vainshtein radius. The data we used is limited by r \u223c\n< 5 h\u22121 Mpc for the differential surface mass density. These facts set a\ndensity, and by r \u223c\nlimit of constraining \u03bc and \u01eb. On the other hand, when the Vainshtein radius rV is smaller\nthan the cluster scales rvir , the effect of the modified gravity appears inside the cluster scale.\nTherefore, we can put a rather tight constraint on \u03bc for small \u01eb.\nIn tables 1 and 2, respectively, the best-fit value of the chi-squared is listed for each halo\nmodel, using the surface mass density and the differential surface mass density. \u03c72MG is the\nbest-fit value allowing the modified gravity model. Note that \u03c72MG is improved, compared\n\n\u2013 18 \u2013\n\n\fFigure 12. Each panel is the same as the left panel of figure 11, but adopted the different halo profile.\nThe panels (a) and (b) adopted the gNFW profile with (\u03b3s , \u03b3l ) = (0.7, 2.8) and (\u03b3s , \u03b3l ) = (1.1, 3.1),\nwhile (c) and (d) adopted the Einasto profile with \u0393 = 0.17 and \u0393 = 0.23, respectively.\n\nFigure 13. Same figure as figure 12 but with the differential surface mass density \u2206\u03a3+ (r\u22a5 ).\n\n\u2013 19 \u2013\n\n\fwith \u03c72GR , which is the best-fit value within Newtonian gravity. We see slight improvement\nfor the NFW profile and the gNFW profile. This reflects that Newtonian gravity is favored\nfrom the data as long as the halo profile is the NFW profile or the gNFW profile.\nAnother point is that the best-fit value is significantly improved by allowing the modified\ngravity for the Einasto profile with \u0393 = 0.23 and \u0393 = 0.3. This can be explained as follows\nby using figures 14 and 15, which show how the fitting is improved by the modified gravity\nmodel. Figure 14 shows that the fitting of \u03a3S (r\u22a5 ) is improved at large radii by the modified\ngravity model. Figure 15 shows that the fitting of \u2206\u03a3+ (r\u22a5 ) is improved at large radii as\nwell as at smaller radii. Thus the modified gravity model is favored if the halo follows the\nEinasto profile with large value of \u0393. This is the reason why the modified gravity is favored\nin the panel (d) of figure 13.\nThe above results rely mostly on the behavior of the theoretical curves in the outer\nregion. Let us check the validity of our theoretical modeling in the outer region. The\nbehavior in the outer region is determined by the halo density profile which we choose and\nthe modified gravity effect of the scalar field. When the density profile is fixed, the modified\ngravity's effect of the scalar field is properly taken into account by using the expression\n(2.13). In the present paper, however, we assumed the halo density profiles irrespective of\nthe modified gravity model. This point will need to be tested carefully, though there exists a\nsupporting evidence in reference [46, 51]. In the modeling of the halo density profile, we only\nconsidered the contribution of the cluster halo profile itself (1-halo term), and we neglect the\nneighboring halos (2-halo term), which will be only important at large radius [94].\n\nFigure 14. This figure compares the observed surface mass density \u03a3S (r\u22a5 ) and the theoretical curve\nassuming the Einasto profile with \u0393 = 0.23 (left panel) and \u0393 = 0.3 (right panel), respectively. In\neach panel, the blue dot and short-dashed curve is the best-fit curve within the Newtonian gravity,\nwhile the green dashed curve is the best-fit curve of the modified gravity. The solid curve assumes\nthe NFW profile within the Newtonian gravity. The left (right) panel adopted \u0393 = 0.23(0.3), and the\nbest-fit parameters for the modified gravity model are \u03bc = 5.0 and \u01eb = 4.5 (\u03bc = 3.4 and \u01eb = 0.69),\nrespectively.\n\n6\n\nSummary and Conclusion\n\nWe investigated a constraint on the subclass of the generalized galileon model endowed with\nthe Vainshtein mechanism, which includes a wide class of scalar-tensor gravity theories.\n\n\u2013 20 \u2013\n\n\fFigure 15. Same figure as figure 14, but for the differential surface mass density \u2206\u03a3+ (r\u22a5 ). The\nbest-fit parameter for the modified gravity is \u03bc = 5.0 and \u01eb = 1.8 (\u03bc = 5.0 and \u01eb = 1.1) in the left\n(right) panel, respectively.\n\nThe generalized galileon model we considered is characterized by the two parameters, \u03bc\nand \u01eb, which describe the amplitude and the typical scale of the modification of gravity\nof the Vainshtein mechanism, respectively. We have investigated how the transition in the\nVainshtein mechanism in the generalized galileon model appears due to a scalar degree of\nfreedom, which leads to a modified relation between the lensing potential and the density\nperturbations of matter. This effect provides us with a unique opportunity for testing gravity,\nusing observational quantities measured through the gravitational lensing.\nIn the present paper, we focused our investigation on the density profile of cluster halo\nobserved with gravitational lensing. Utilizing the observational data of the surface mass\ndensity in [76] and the differential surface mass density in [77], we obtained the constraint\non the parameters \u03bc and \u01eb for the first time, assuming the NFW profile, the gNFW profile\nand the Einasto profile as the halo density profile. We obtained the constraint, for instance,\n< \u03bc < 0.6 for \u01eb = 0.1, and \u22121.5 < \u03bc < 2.5 for \u01eb = 1.0, respectively, at 1-sigma confidence\n\u22120.4 \u223c\n\u223c\n\u223c \u223c\nlevel, assuming the NFW profile (see figure 11). The constraint on \u03bc is better for small \u01eb,\nbut the constraint on \u03bc becomes rather weak as \u01eb becomes larger. Newtonian gravity is\nfavored when the NFW profile is assumed. This result is not altered when the gNFW profile\nis assumed (see section 4). However, the modified gravity is favored than Newtonian gravity\nwhen the Einasto profile with large \u0393 is assumed (see section 5). The constraint obtained with\nour method is not very tight. The original galileon model is not excluded in our test. But this\nmethod provides us with a unique chance to test the gravity theory on halo scales with cluster\nsurveys, such as Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam survey [98], CLASH [100], LoCuSS [101], and\nXXM-XXL [102].\nIn the present paper, we assumed the well-known density profiles of halo, which should\nbe carefully tested with N-body simulations. In reference [46], properties of halos in the\nDGP modified gravity model are investigated. The DGP model possesses the Vainshtein\nmechanism similar to the galileon model.3 From the N-body simulations in reference [46], it\nis suggested that the NFW profile describes the density profile of halos in the DGP model\n3\nIn the DGP model the relation connecting the lensing potential and the density perturbation is not\naltered, therefore it is difficult to obtain a constraint with the method in the present paper.\n\n\u2013 21 \u2013\n\n\fthough the parameters of the profiles are scaled. This supports our assumption. However,\nin order to make the constraint robust, we need to check the modeling of the halo profile\nin future. As we considered the simple halo model in our analysis, our modeling of halo is\nvalid only within the radius smaller than a few Mpc. In order to use the observational data\nincluding larger radius [94], we need a more sophisticated formulation, which is also left as a\nfuture problem.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank Keiichi Umetsu and Masamune Oguri for providing us with their data and useful\ncomments.
