We introduce a smooth projective variety Td,n which\ncompactifies the space of configurations of n distinct points on\naffine d-space modulo translation and homothety.

For example, as we prove, the boundary is\na smooth normal crossings divisor whose components are products\nof Td,i for i < n, it has an inductive construction analogous to but\ndiffering from Keel's for M 0,n which can be used to describe its\nChow groups, Chow motive and Poincar\u00e9 polynomials, generalizing\n[Kee92, Man95]. We give a presentation of the Chow rings of Td,n ,\nexhibit explicit dual bases for the dimension 1 and codimension\n1 cycles. The variety Td,n is embedded in the Fulton-MacPherson\nspaces X[n] for any smooth variety X and we use this connection in\na number of ways. For example, to give a family of ample divisors\non Td,n and to give an inductive presentation of the Chow groups\nand the Chow motive of X[n] analogous to Keel's presentation for\nM 0,n , solving a problem posed by Fulton and MacPherson.\n\n1. Introduction\nFix an arbitrary ground field k. By a variety over k we mean a\nreduced (but not necessarily integral), seperated scheme of finite type\nover k.\nLet T Hd,n denote the space of configurations of n distinct points\non affine d-space up to translation and homothety. Equivalently, this\nmay be regarded as the space of embeddings of a hyperplane and n\ndistinct points not lying on the hyperplane in projective d-space, up\nto projective automorphisms. When d = 1, this is the moduli space\nM0,n+1 of pointed rational curves. In this paper, we introduce and\nstudy varieties Td,n which compactify T Hd,n for d \u2265 1, n \u2265 2. We\nprove that Td,n is a smooth, projective, irreducible, rational variety of\ndimension dn \u2212 d \u2212 1 (c.f. Corollary 3.4.2). The points of Td,n are\n1\n\n\fin one to one correspondence with stable n-pointed rooted trees of ddimensional projective spaces (Definition 2.0.2, Theorem 3.4.4). These\npointed trees of projective spaces are higher-dimensional analogs of\nstable pointed rational curves. Indeed, T1,n \u223c\n= M 0,n+1 (Theorem 3.4.3).\nRemarkably, Td,n seems to share nearly all of the combinatorial and\nstructural advantages of M 0,n .\nThere has been much interest in possible higher-dimensional generalizations of M 0,n . For example, Kapranov's Chow quotients compactify\nthe moduli spaces of ordered n-tuples of hyperplanes in Pr in general\nlinear position in [Kap93a]. These are isomorphic to M 0,n when r = 1.\nHacking, Keel, and Tevelev defined and studied another compactification of hyperplane arrangements in projective space as the closure\ninside the moduli spaces of stable pairs (see [KT, HKT]). These spaces\nare reducible, with Kapranov's Chow quotients as one component.\nThe Fulton-MacPherson space X[n], defined as a compactification\nof the space of configurations of n distinct points on a smooth variety\nX, is also a kind of higher-dimensional analog of M 0,n . In particular,\nP1 [n] is birational, although not isomorphic, to M 0,n+3 (see [FM94]).\nFrom a different perspective, one may show that M 0,n+1 may be\nviewed as a subscheme of X[n] for any smooth curve X. In more\ngenerality, Td,n arises as a subscheme of X[n] for any smooth variety\nX of dimension d.\nModuli spaces of pointed rational curves are intimately related to\nmoduli spaces of curves of higher genus g. Namely, by attaching curves\nin various ways, one can define maps from M 0,n+1 to the boundary of\nM g,m . It has been possible to reduce important questions about the\nbirational geometry of M g,n for g > 0 to moduli of pointed rational\ncurves [GKM02]. Analogously, by using various attaching maps, the\nvariety Td,n maps to the boundary of the Fulton-MacPherson space\nX[n]. In fact, Td,n is a fiber of the natural projection map from the\nboundary component D(N) \u2282 X[n] to X (Definition 3.1.1). We exploit\nthis fundamental fact to study Td,n as well as to answer a question\nposed by Fulton and MacPherson about the Chow groups of X[n] (cf.\nTheorem 4.2.1).\nAnother generalization of the moduli space of curves is the stack\nM g,n (X, \u03b2) of stable maps from n-pointed stable curves of genus g to a\nvariety X. When X is a point and g = 0, we recover M 0,n . Stable maps\nhave been particularly studied because their Chow rings determine the\nGromov-Witten invariants of the variety X. The work of Oprea and\nPandharipande, for example, show that the combinatorial structure of\nM 0,n plays a major role in the understanding the intersection theory\n2\n\n\fof the more general spaces ([Opr04a, Opr04b, Opr04c, Pan99]). It is\nconceivable that the Td,n could be used to study moduli of stable maps\nfrom higher dimensional varieties.\nThe authors would like to thank P. Deligne and R. Pandharipande\nfor helpful conversations.\n1.1. Summary of Results.\nInductive construction, Chow groups, Chow motives, Poincar\u00e9 polynomials, and functor of points\nWe describe a functor which represents Td,n in Section 3 (cf. Proposition 3.6.1 and Lemma 3.6.4) and use it to prove that Td,n can be\nconstructed inductively. More specifically, we prove:\nTheorem (3.3.1). The variety Td,n may be constructed as the result of\na sequence of blowups of a projective bundle over Td,n\u22121 .\nIn particular, this gives a construction of M 0,n which differs from\nprevious constructions of Keel and of Kapranov ([Kee92, Kap93b]).\nWe use this construction to obtain an inductive presentation the Chow\ngroups and the Chow motive of Td,n (Section 4) and a description of\nits Poincar\u00e9 polynomial (Section 5).\nAmple divisors\nUsing the embedding of Td,n as a closed subvariety of the FultonMacPherson configuration space X[n] for a smooth d-dimensional variety X, we exhibit a family of ample divisors for Td,n in Theorem 3.5.1.\nBoundary of Td,n , and stratification\nWe characterize the boundary of the Td,n , showing it is composed of\nsmooth normal crossings divisors which are (isomorphic to) products\nof smaller Td,i . In particular, for each S ( N, there is a nonsingular divisor Td,n (S) \u2282 Td,n such that the union of these divisors Td,n (S) forms\nthe boundary Td,n \\T Hd,n . Any set of these divisors meets transversally.\nAn intersection of divisors\nTd,n (S1 ) \u2229 * * * \u2229 Td,n (Sr )\nis nonempty exactly when the sets Si are nested ; each pair is either\ndisjoint, or one is contained in the other. Moreover, the boundary\ncomponents Td,n (S) are products. Namely,\nTd,n (S) \u223c\n= Td,n\u2212|S|+1 \u00d7 Td,|S| ,\nfor S ( N, |S| > 1 (Theorem 3.3.1, part 4).\n3\n\n\fMore generally, as in the case d = 1, the Td,n are stratified by the\n(closure) of the locus of points corresponding to varieties having k\ndistinct components. There is a natural divisor class \u03b4N on Td,n ; for d =\n1, \u03b4N = \u2212\u03c8n+1 (beginning of Section 6). We give a simple presentation\nfor the Chow ring of Td,n in terms of the \u03b4N and the boundary classes:\nA\u2217 (Td,n ) \u223c\n= Z[{\u03b4S }S\u2282N,2\u2264|S|]/Id,n ,\nwhere the ideal Id,n is generated by two simple types of relations (Theorem 6.0.4). As in the case of T1,n \u223c\n= M 0,n+1 , there are natural maps\nbetween the spaces given by dropping points. That is, for every i \u2208\n{1, . . . , n}, there is a natural projection Td,n \u2192 Td,n\u22121 given by \"dropping the ith point,\" (Remark 3.6.6). We prove that Td,n is an HI space\n(Corollary 7.3.4) when defined over C. That is, H 2\u2217 (Td,n ) \u223c\n= A\u2217 (Td,n ).\nWe describe a relationship between boundary divisors and certain\nexplicitly given one-cycles which yields an integer pairing between divisors and curves on Td,n (Theorem 6.0.5). These classes form a basis\nfor 1-cycles modulo rational equivalence (Corollary 6.0.6). We also\ngive an explicit conjectural pairing between cycles of complementary\ndimension on Td,n (cf. Section 6.1).\n2. The closed points of Td,n\nIn this section, we give a geometric description of the closed points\nof Td,n in terms of isomorphism classes of n-pointed rooted trees of\nd-dimensional projective spaces.\nChoose a pair of smooth d-dimensional varieties X1 , X2 , a point\np \u2208 X1 and a subvariety H \u2282 X2 such that H \u223c\n= Pd\u22121 . Let Y be\nthe blowup of X1 at p. We may form a new variety, which we will\ndenote by X1 #p,H X2 by identifying the exceptional divisor in Y with\nthe subvariety H \u2208 X2 . In the case d = 1 this correponds to attaching\ntwo curves together by identifying a point on one with a point on the\nother.\nTo describe a tree of d-dimensional projective spaces, we will use\ntrees as book keeping devices. Recall that a rooted tree is a graph\nwithout cycles and with a distinguished vertex. We will use the notation G = (VG , EG , vG ) where VG is a set of verticies, vG \u2208 VG is a\ndistinguished vertex called the root and EG \u2282 VG \u00d7 VG is the set of\negdes to denote such an object. Recall that given a rooted tree G, there\nis a natural partial order on VG in which the root vG is the initial or\nsmallest element. Given w < w \u2032 we say that w \u2032 is a descendant of w.\nIn the case that w < w \u2032 and there is no vertex w \u2032\u2032 with w < w \u2032\u2032 < w \u2032,\nwe say that w \u2032 is a daughter of w and that w is the parent of w \u2032 .\n4\n\n\fWe define d-dimensional gluing data for a tree G to be a collection of\nprojective spaces Xw \u223c\n= Pd for each w \u2208 VG together with a rule which\nassociates to each vertex w \u2208 VG a hyperplane Hw \u2282 Xw and to each\npair w, w \u2032 \u2208 VG , where w \u2032 is a daughter of w, a point p(w, w \u2032) \u2208 Xw\nsuch that the points p(w, w \u2032) \u2208 Xw are all distinct as w \u2032 varies over the\ndaughters of w, and do not lie on the hyperplane H(w). We denote\nthis data by (X, p, H). Given such gluing data, we may define a variety\n# X inductively on the order of V as follows:\np,H\n\n(1) If |V | = 1, then # X = Xv = Pd ,\np,H\n\n(2) If |V | = n + 1, choose a vertex w \u2208 VG with no daughters, and\nlet w \u2032 \u2208 VG be the parent of w. Let G\u2032 be the tree obtained by\nremoving w and all edges incident with w. Let X \u2032 , p\u2032 , H \u2032 be the\nrestrictions of the functions X, p, H to G\u2032 . Then\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2032\n# X = # X #p(w\u2032 ,w),Hw Xw .\np,H\n\np\u2032 ,H \u2032\n\ne = # X, each component is a blowup of\nWe note that in the variety X\np,H\n\none of the varieties Xw and consequently there is a 1-1 correspondence\ne and the verticies VG . The singular locus\nbetween the components of X\ne is exactly the intersections of the different components. Each\nof X\ncomponent has a distinguished hyperplane Hw , which is in the singular\ne unless w = vG is the root of G.\nlocus of X\n\nDefinition 2.0.1. A rooted tree of d-dimensional projective spaces (a\nd-RTPS ) is a connected variety Z together with a closed embedding\nf : Pd\u22121 \u0592\u2192 Z (called the root) such that there is some rooted tree\nG and gluing data (X, p, H) such that Z \u223c\n= # X, and f defines an\np,H\n\nisomorphism of P\n\nd\u22121\n\nwith HvG .\n\nDefinition 2.0.2. An n-pointed d-RTPS (Pd\u22121 \u0592\u2192 Z, p1, . . . , pn ) is a\nd-RTPS with distinct marked points p1 , . . . , pn \u2208 Z such that:\n(1) pi is not in the singular locus of Z,\n(2) For all i, pi does not lie in (the image of) the root.\nDefinition 2.0.3. (Pd\u22121 \u0592\u2192 Z, p1 , . . . , pn ) is stable if each component\nW \u2282 Z contains at least two distinct markings, where a marking is\neither a marked point pi or an exceptional divisor. Note that each exceptional divisor corresponds to a daughter of the vertex corresponding\nto W .\n5\n\n\fNote that this agrees with the situation for a stable pointed rational curve. Although the standard definition in this case is requires 3\nmarkings, in our general situation we do not count the hyperplanes Hw\nas markings. Since each component has exactly one such hyperplane,\nthis shows that our definition is specializes to the standard one.\nDefinition 2.0.4. Two n-pointed rooted trees of d-dimensional projective spaces (Pd\u22121 \u0592\u2192 Z, p1 , . . . , pn ) and (Pd\u22121 \u0592\u2192 Z \u2032 , q1 , . . . , qn ) are\nisomorphic if there is an isomorphism of algebraic varieties f : Z \u2192 Z \u2032\nsuch that f (pi ) = qi and the following diagram commutes:\nPd\u22121\n\u2745\n\u2745\n\u2758\n\u2732 Z \u2032.\n\n\u2720\n\nZ\n\nThe following proposition is easy to verify explicitly:\nProposition 2.0.5. An n-pointed rooted tree of d-dimensional projective spaces is stable if and only if it has no nontrivial automorphisms.\nAs a simple example, consider a stable (n + 1)-pointed rational curve\nconsisting of three components Zi \u223c\n= P1 such that Z2 and Z3 are attached to Z1 by identifying for each i \u2208 {2, 3} a point hi \u2208 Xi with\nei \u2208 X1 . Suppose there are s \u2265 2 points p1 ,. . . , ps \u2208 X2 \\ {h2 } and\nn \u2212 s \u2265 2 points ps+1 ,. . . pn \u2208 X3 \\ {h3 } and the (n + 1)-st point pn+1 is\non Z3 \\ {e2 , e3 }. The curve is a tree of projective lines and is illustrated\nbelow in figure 1. We call pn+1 \u2208 X1 the root of the tree.\nMore generally, let Z1 = Bl{q,q\u2032 } Pd be the blow up of Pd at the points\nq and q \u2032 with exceptional divisors E2 and E3 , and let H1 = Pd\u22121 \u0592\u2192\nZ1 \\{q, q \u2032} be an embedded hyperplane. Let Z2 be isomorphic to Pd with\nfixed marked points p1 ,. . . , ps \u2208 Z2 and a fixed embedded hyperplane\nH2 = Pd\u22121 \u0592\u2192 Z2 \\ {p1 , . . . , ps }. Finally, let Z3 be isomorphic to Pd\nwith marked points ps+1 ,. . .,pn \u2208 Z3 and an embedded hyperplane H3 =\nPd\u22121 \u0592\u2192 Z3 \\ {ps+1 , . . . , pn }. Let H2 be identified pointwise with E2 and\nH3 with E3 . When the components are attached, they from a tree. We\ncall the embedded hyperplane H1 = Pd\u22121 \u2282 X1 the root of the tree,\nshown below in figure 2 when d = 2. If s \u2265 2 and n \u2212 s \u2265 2, the\ntree is stable; it has no nontrivial automorphisms fixing the embedded\nhyperplanes pointwise which preserve the marked points.\n6\n\n\f1\n0\n\n00\n11\n00\n11\n11\n00\n00\n11\n\nX2\n\n0\n1\n1\n0\n\n{q1,..,q t}\n\n{p1,..,p s}\n\n11\n00\n00\n11\n\n1\n0\n0\n1\n\np\n\nn+1\n11\n00\n\ne2=h2\n\n0\n1\n11\n00\n\n1\n0\n\nX3\n\n1\n0\n\n1\n0\n0\n1\n\nE3\nH2\n\nH3\n\nE2\n\n00000000000\n11111111111\nX11111111111\n00000000000\n2\n00000000000\n11111111111\n\ne3=h 3\n\n11111111111\n00000000000\n00000000000\n11111111111\n00000000000\n11111111111\n00000000000\n11111111111\n00000000000\n11111111111\n00000000000\n11111111111\n00000000000\n11111111111\n00000000000\n11111111111\n1\n00000000000\n11111111111\n00000000000\n11111111111\n00000000000\n11111111111\n\nH\n\nX1\n\nFigure 1. d = 1\n\n1\n0\n\n{q 1,..,q t} 0\n0\n1\n0\n11\n\n{p1 ,..,p s}\n\nX3\nX1\n\nFigure 2. d = 2\n\n3. Definition and Inductive Construction of Td,n\nIn this section we define the variety Td,n as an abstract variety. This is\ndone by using the construction of the Fulton-MacPherson configuration\nspace as in [FM94].\n3.1. Inductive Construction of the Fulton-Macpherson Space.\nLet X be a smooth variety of dimension d, and let x \u2208 X(k). As in\n[FM94], we let X[n] denote the Fulton-MacPherson configuration space\nof n points on X, whose construction we recall below (with some minor\nchanges in notation). Set N = {1, . . . , n}. The space X[n] comes with\na morphism X[n] \u2192 X n . For every subset S \u2282 N with |S| \u2265 2, Fulton\nand MacPherson define a codimension 1 smooth subvariety D(S) \u2282\nX[n] which maps into the diagonal \u2206S = {(xi ) \u2208 X n |xi = xj for i, j \u2208\nS}. In particular, we have a morphism \u03c0 : D(N) \u2192 X \u223c\n= \u2206N \u2282 X n .\nX,x\nDefinition 3.1.1. Td,n\n= \u03c0 \u22121 (x).\n\nWe shall prove that this definition does not depend on the smooth\nvariety X or on the point x \u2208 X(k). Thus we simply write Td,n for\nX,x\nTd,n\n. To show this, we describe the functor which it represents later\nin this section and show that this functor is independent of our choices\n(see Definition 3.6.1). We also show that the points of Td,n correspond\nto the n-pointed stable d-RTPS's from the previous section (Theorem\n3.4.4).\nIn order to set notation and motivate our work on the spaces Td,n ,\nwe now recall Fulton and MacPherson's construction of X[n].\nThe construction of these spaces is given inductively. It will be\nnotationally convenient to let N = {1, . . . , n}, and we may occasionally\nwrite X[N] to mean X[n]. For a subset S \u2282 N we let S + be the subset\nS \u222a {n + 1} \u2282 {1, . . . , n + 1}. In particular, N + = {1, . . . , n + 1}.\nAt the n'th step in the process, we will have constructed:\n(1) a space X[n],\n7\n\n\f(2) a morphism \u03c0n : X[n] \u2192 X n (which we will write as \u03c0 when n\nis understood),\n(3) for each subset S \u2282 N with |S| \u2265 2, a divisor D(S) \u2282 X[n].\nWe begin by giving the definition of the first two spaces directly. For\nn = 1, we set X[1] = X. For n = 2, we let X[2] = Bl\u2206 (X \u00d7 X) be\nthe blowup of X \u00d7 X along the diagonal \u2206. We define D({1, 2}) to be\nthe exceptional divisor of this blowup, and let \u03c0 : X[2] \u2192 X 2 be the\nblowup map.\nTo go from X[n] to X[n + 1] requires a series of steps in itself. We'll\nconstruct a sequence of smooth varieties:\n\u03c1n\n\n\u03c1k+1\n\n\u03c1n\u22121\n\nX[n, n] \u2212\u2192 X[n, n \u2212 1] \u2212\u2192 * * * \u2212\u2192 X[n, k + 1] \u2212\u2192 X[n, k] \u2212\u2192\n\u03c11\n\n* * * \u2212\u2192 X[n, 1] \u2212\u2192 X[n, 0],\nso that X[n, n] = X[n + 1]. We will define these varieties X[n, k]\ninductively with respect to k. At each step, we will construct for 0 \u2264\nk \u2264 n:\n(1) a smooth variety X[n, k],\n(2) a morphism \u03c1k : X[n, k] \u2192 X[n, k \u2212 1] when k > 0,\n(3) smooth subvarieties X[n, k](S \u2032 ) for each subset S \u2032 \u2282 N + with\nat least two elements.\nIn the case k = 0, we set X[n, 0] = X[n] \u00d7 X. For S \u2032 \u2282 N \u2282\nN + , we define X[n, 0](S \u2032) = D(S \u2032 ) \u00d7 X. Let pi : X[n] \u2192 X n \u2192 X\nbe the composition of \u03c0n with the i'th projection map. We define\nX[n, 0]({i}+ ) to be the graph of pi - in other words, it is the image of the\nmorphism id \u00d7 pi : X[n] \u2192 X[n] \u00d7 X. Now suppose that S \u2282 N, |S| \u2265\n2. It turns out that if i, j \u2208 S, then if we let \u0393i = id \u00d7 pi : D(S) \u2212\u2192\nD(S) \u00d7 X, the images \u0393i (D(S)) and \u0393j (D(S)) are isomorphic. We\ndenote these common maps by \u0393S and define X[n, 0](S + ) to be the\nimage \u0393S (D(S)).\nThe variety X[n, 1] is defined to be the blowup of X[n, 0] along the\nsubvariety X[n, 0](N + ). For S \u2032 6= N + , the variety X[n, 1](S \u2032 ) is defined\nto be the proper transform of X[n, 0](S \u2032 ), and we define X[n, 1](N + )\nto be the exceptional divisor. We have the following pullback diagram:\nX[n, 1](N + )\n\nP (NN )\n\nX[n, 1]\n/\n\n\u03c11\n\n\u000f\n\u000f\n+\n\nX[n, 0](N )\n/\n\nX[n, 0]\n\nX[n] \u00d7 X,\n\nwhere NN = NX[n,0](N + ) X[n, 0] is the normal bundle of X[n, 0](N + )\nin X[n, 0] and X[n, 1](N + ) = P (NN ) is the exceptional divisor of the\n8\n\n\fblowup. It will be useful to consider the first Chern class of this bundle,\nand so we will set lN = c1 (ONN (1)).\nOnce X[n, k] has been constructed for k \u2265 1 along with its subschemes X[n, k](S \u2032 ), the variety X[n, k +1], together with its morphism\n\u03c1k+1 : X[n, k + 1] \u2192 X[n, k], is defined to be the blowup along the disjoint union of the subvarieties X[n, k](U + ), where U ranges over all\nsubsets of N of cardinality n \u2212 k. Fulton and MacPherson prove that\nthese subvarieties are all disjoint ([FM94]). For S \u2032 = U + where U \u2282 N,\n|U| = n \u2212 k, we define X[n, k + 1](U + ) to be the exceptional divisor in\nX[n, k + 1] lying over X[n, k](U + ). For S \u2032 \u2208 N + not of this form, we\ndefine X[n, k + 1](S \u2032 ) to be the proper transform of X[n, k](S \u2032 ).\nFor each U \u2282 N of cardinality |U| = n \u2212 k we have the following\npullback diagram:\nX[n, k + 1](U + )\n\nP (NU )\n/\n\nX[n, k + 1]\n\n\u000f\n\nX[n, k](U + )\n\n\u000f\n/\n\nX[n, k],\n\nwhere NU = NX[n,k](U + ) X[n, k] is the normal bundle of X[n, k](U + ) in\nX[n, k] and X[n, k + 1](U + ) = P (NU ) is the exceptional divisor of the\nblowup. We write lU = c1 (ONU (1)).\nTo complete the construction of X[n + 1] = X[n, n], we define for\n\u2032\nS \u2208 N + , X[n + 1](S) = X[n, n](S \u2032 ) and \u03c0 : X[n + 1] \u2192 X n to be the\ncomposition\nX[n + 1] = X[n, n]\n\n\u03c11 \u25e6***\u25e6\u03c1n\n\n/\n\nX[n, 0] = X[n] \u00d7 X\n\n\u03c0n \u00d7idX\n\n/\n\nXn\n\nFor convenience of notation, we define X[n, i](S1 , . . . , Sk ) = X[n, i](S1 )\u2229\n* * * \u2229 X[n, i](Sk ).\nTheorem 3.1.2. Let \u2205 =\n6 S \u2282 N 6= 2, |S| = i. Choose a \u2208 N. Then:\n(1) The morphisms X[n, n\u22121]({a}+ ) \u2192 X[n] and X[n, n\u2212s](S + ) \u2192\nX[n, 0](S + ) \u223c\n= D(S) are isomorphisms for |S| \u2265 2.\n(2) The morphism X[n, 1](N + ) \u2192 X[n, 0](N + ) is a projective bundle morphism of relative dimension d.\n(3) The morphism X[n, i+1](N + ) \u2192 X[n, i](N + ) for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n\u22121\nis a blowup along the union of subvarieties X[n, i](N + , S + ) for\nS \u2282 N, |S| = n \u2212 i.\n(4) For S as above, the morphism X[n, i](N + , S + ) \u2192 X[n, 0](N + , S + )\nis an isomorphism.\n9\n\n\fProof. Parts 1, 2, and 3 follow from [FM94] proposition 3.5. For part 4,\nwe have by part 1, X[n, i](S + ) \u2192 X[n, 0](S + ) is an isomorphism. Consequently, when we restrict to X[n, i](N + , S + ), we get an isomorphism\n\u0003\nX[n, i](N + , S + ) \u223c\n= X[n, 0](N + , S + ).\n3.2. Functors of points related to the Fulton-Macpherson space.\nIt will be useful for us to have a description of the functors represented\nby the varieties X[n, i] and X[n, i](S1 , . . . , Sk ). Suppose H is a variety and h : H \u2192 X n+1 is a morphism. For a subset S \u2282 N, we\nuse the notation hS to denote the composition of h with the projection\n+\nX N \u2192 X S , and we write ha for h{a} . Let \u2206S \u2282 X S denote the (small)\ndiagonal, and IS the ideal sheaf of \u2206S in X S . Note that for S1 \u2282 S2 ,\nthe projection X S2 \u2192 X S1 induces a morphism h\u2217S1 IS1 \u2192 h\u2217S2 IS2 .\nDefinition 3.2.1. Let H and h be as above. A screen for h and\nS \u2282 N + is an invertible quotient \u03c6S : h\u2217 IS \u2192 LS . A collection of\nscreens \u03c6S1 , . . . , \u03c6Sk is compatible if whenever Si \u2282 Sj , there is a unique\nmorphism LSi \u2192 LSj which makes the following diagram commute:\nh\u2217Si ISi\n/\n\n\u000f\n\nL Si\n\u000f\n\nh\u2217Sj ISj\n/\n\nL Sj\n\nDefinition 3.2.2. A subset S \u2282 N + satisfies property Pi , (S \u2208 Pi ) if\neither S \u2282 N, |S| \u2265 2 or S = T + , |T | > n \u2212 i.\nDefinition 3.2.3. We define the functor X [n, i] from the category of\nschemes to the category of sets by setting X [n, i](H) to be the set of\npairs\n\u0010\n\u0011\n+\n(h : H \u2192 X N ), {\u03c6T : h\u2217T IT \u2192 LT }T \u2208Pi ,\nsuch that the \u03c6T 's form a compatible collection of screens. We define\nthe subfunctor X [n, i](S1 , . . . , Sk ) by setting X [n, i](S1 , . . . Sk )(H) to\nbe the subset of X [n, i] such that whenever T \u2208 Pi with |T \u2229 Sj | \u2265 2\nand T 6\u2282 Sj for some j, the compatibility morphism LT \u2229Sj \u2192 LT is\nzero.\nThe following theorem is useful not only for understanding the iterative construction of the space Td,n , but also for the applications to the\nFulton-MacPherson configuration space in Section 4.\nTheorem 3.2.4 ([FM94]). The functors X [n, i] and X [n, i](S1 , . . . , Sk )\nare represented by the varieties X[n, i] and X[n, i](S1 , . . . , Sk ) respectively.\n10\n\n\f3.3. Inductive construction of Td,n . We now present an inductive\nconstruction of Td,n as a sequence of blowups of a projective bundle\nover Td,n\u22121 . This allows us to give an explicit inductive presentation of\nits Chow groups, its Chow motive and in the next section, a description\nof its Poincar\u00e9 polynomial.\ni\nTheorem 3.3.1. There is a sequence of smooth varieties Fd,n\n, for 0 \u2264\ni\n+\ni \u2264 n, with subvarieties Fd,n (T ) indexed by T ( N , |T | \u2265 2 and\ni+1\ni\nmorphisms bi : Fd,n\n\u2192 Fd,n\nsuch that:\n0\nn\n(1) Fd,n\n= Td,n and Fd,n\n= Td,n+1 ,\n1\n0\n(2) the morphism b0 : Fd,n\n\u2192 Fd,n\n= Td,n is a projective bundle\nmorphism of relative dimension d,\n(3) the morphisms bi for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n \u2212 1 are blowups along the union\ni\nof the subvarieties Fd,n\n(S + ), |S| = n \u2212 i,\ni\n(4) Fd,n\n(S + ) \u223c\n= Td,s \u00d7 Td,n\u2212s+1 where s = |S| = n \u2212 i if i 6= n \u2212 1,\nn\u22121\n(5) Fd,n ({a}+ ) \u223c\n= Td,n .\n\nThis theorem closely parallels the above situation for the Fulton\nMacPherson configuration space X[n + 1] from X[n] \u00d7 X, and in fact\nwe derive it mainly as a consequence of a careful analysis of certain\naspects of this construction. Although very similar in structure to\nthe construction of Keel [Kee92] in the case d = 1, we note that our\nconstruction is different. For example, the analog of our (nontrivial)\nprojective bundle b0 in Keel's construction is always a trivial vector\nbundle.\ni\nThe varieties Fd,n\nand Fd,n (S) are defined as follows:\nDefinition 3.3.2. Let X be a smooth projective d-dimensional variety, and choose x \u2208 X(k). We abuse notation slightly (by using the\nsymbol \u03c0 in two different ways) and let \u03c0 : X[n, i](N + ) \u2192 X be the\ncomposition\nX[n, i](N + )\n/\n\nX[n, i]\n\n\u03c11 ***\u03c1i\n\n/\n\nX[n] \u00d7 X\n\n\u03c0\u00d7idX\n\n/\n\nX n+1\n/\n\nwhere the final arrow is any of the projections (all give the same rei\ni\nsult). We define Fd,n\nto be \u03c0 \u22121 (x) = X[n, i](N + ) \u00d7X x and Fd,n\n(S) =\n+\n+\n0\n+\n0\nX[n, i](N , S )\u00d7X x. We also define Td,n (S) = Fd,n (S ) \u2282 Fd,n = Td,n .\nThe proof of Theorem 3.3.1 follows from the following proposition\ncombined with Theorem 3.1.2.\nProposition 3.3.3. Suppose X is a smooth variety with trivial tangent\nbundle, and let S \u2282 N, |S| = s. Then if 0 \u2264 i \u2264 s, we have an\ni\nisomorphism X[n, n \u2212 s + i](S + ) = X[n \u2212 s + 1] \u00d7 Fd,s\ncommuting with\nthe natural projections to X[n \u2212 s + 1].\n11\n\nX\n\n\fIn particular, in proving this proposition, it immediately follows that\nDefinitions 3.3.2 and 3.1.1 do not depend on the variety X or on the\npoint x, since the tangent bundle is locally trivial. Note that it follows\nthat for X with trivial tangent bundle, we have X[n, n\u2212s+i](S + , T + ) \u223c\n=\ni\nX[n\u2212s+1]\u00d7Fd,n\n(T + ) for T ( S by restricting the above isomorphism.\nRemark 3.3.4. We see by this reasoning that in definition 3.3.2, the\nmaps \u03c0 : X[n, i](N + ) \u2192 X and \u03c0|X[n,i](N + ,S + ) locally have a product\nstructure as above, and so in particular, [Fd,n (S)] = \u03b9!x [X[n, i](N + , S + )]\nin the Chow groups of X[n, i](N + ) and Fd,n respectively,\nwhere \u03b9x is\u0003\n\u0002\nthe inclusion of the point x into X. Since the class X[n,\ni](N + , S + )\u0003\n\u0002\non X[n, i](N + ) can also be seen as the Gysin pullback j ! X[n, i](S + )\nwhere j : X[n, i](N + ) \u0002\u0592\u2192 X[n, i] is\n\u0003 the natural embedding, we may\n+\n+\n! !\nwrite [Fd,n (S )] = \u03b9 j X[n, i](S ) , and it makes \u0002sense therefore\n\u0003 to\nabuse notation and formally define [Fd,n (N + )] = \u03b9! j ! X[n, i](N + ) . We\n0\nalso set [Td,n (S)] = [Fd,n\n(S + )].\nproof of proposition 3.3.3. By Theorem 3.2.4, we may translate a morphism to X[n, n \u2212 s + i](S + ) to a collection of screen data. Suppose\nf : H \u2192 X[n, n \u2212 s + i](S + ) corresponds to a collection of screens\n\u0010\n\u0011\n+\n(h : H \u2192 X N ), {\u03c6T : h\u2217T IT \u2192 LT }T \u2208Pi .\n\nNote that if T \u2282 S or T = S + , the function hT maps entirely into the\ndiagonal \u2206T \u2282 X T , and so by factoring hT through \u2206T \u223c\n= X, we may\n\u2217\nidentify hT IT\u0001 with the pullback of the conormal sheaf h{a} IT /IT2 =\n\u2217\n(T X)T /T X , where a \u2208 T . Note that we have h{a} = h{b} for\nany b \u2208 S + , and so it suffices to choose a \u2208 S + . The screen for T\ntherefore translates to specifying a 1-dimensional sub-vector bundle\niT : LT \u0592\u2192 (T X)T /T X compatible with respect to the natural projec\u2032\ntions (T X)T /T X \u2192 (T X)T /T X for T \u2032 \u2282 T . Since V is trivial, we\nmay write T X = VX where V is a vector space over k of dimension d.\nLet Fd,s (H) denote the set of collections of compatible line sub-vector\nbundles of the form {iT : LT \u0592\u2192 V T /V }T \u2282S or T =S + . It is not hard to\ncheck from this description that Fd,s in fact defines a functor which is\nrepresented by Fd,s .\nTo complete the proof, we note that by the above, a morphism to\ni\nX[n, n \u2212 s + i](S + ) gives a morphism to Fd,s\n. We may also obtain a\nmorphism to X[n \u2212 s + 1] by choosing a point a \u2208 S + and keeping\nonly the screens for subsets T \u2282 (N \\ S) \u222a {a}. This gives a morphism\nX[n, n \u2212 s + i](S + ) \u2192 X[n \u2212 s + 1] \u00d7 Fd,s . We may obtain an inverse\nmorphism by describing how to take the screens for T \u2282 (N \\ S) \u222a\n{a} together with the screens for T \u2282 S + and define screens for the\n12\n\n\fremaining T \u2208 Pn\u2212s+1 . This is done in a way similar to the proof of\nTheorem 3.1.2, part 1 and we leave the detailed proof to the reader.\nWe mention as a guide that for T of the form T = U \u222aR where U \u2282 S +\nand R \u2229 S + = \u2205, we set LT = LR\u222a{a} if R 6= \u2205, and otherwise LT = L\u2217T\nif T \u2282 S + .\n\u0003\nproof of Theorem 3.3.1. Note that we may obtain the product decomposition Td,n (S) \u223c\n= Td,s \u00d7 Td,n\u2212s+1 , where s = |S| by letting X be a\nvariety with trivial tangent bundle and considering the commutative\ndiagram where the upper square is a pullback:\nX[n, n \u2212 s + i](S + , N + )\ni\nfibers \u223c\n= Fd,s\n\nX[n \u2212 s + i, 0]\n\n\u0010\n\n\u000f\n\n(N \\ S) \u222a {a}\n\nfibers \u223c\n= Td,n\u2212s+1\n\n/\n\n\u0001+ \u0011\n\nX[n, n \u2212 s + i](S + )\ni\nfibers \u223c\n= Fd,s\n\n\u000f\n/\n\nX[n \u2212 s + 1]\n\n\u000f\n\n\u000f\n\nX\n\nX\n\u0003\n\n3.4. Basic properties of Td,n . We now give an example of these\nspaces for \"minimal\" values of n:\nProposition 3.4.1. We have isomorphisms T1,3 \u223c\n= P1 and for d > 1,\nd\u22121\nTd,2 \u223c\n= P . Under these identifications, [T1,3 ({1, 2, 3})] = OP1 (\u22121),\nand [Td,2 ({1, 2})] = OPd\u22121 (\u22121).\nProof. First consider the case of Td,2 . We know that Ad [2] = Bl\u2206 (Ad \u00d7\nAd ), and that D({1, 2}) is the exceptional divisor of the blowup [FM94].\nTherefore\nD({1, 2}) = P (N\u2206 (Ad \u00d7 Ad )) \u223c\n= Pd\u22121 \u00d7 Ad .\nIn particular, Td,2 \u223c\n= Pd\u22121 as claimed.\nFor the case of T1,3 , we note that A1 [3] = Bl\u2206 (A1 )3 , where \u2206 is the\nsmall diagonal with exceptional divisor D({1, 2, 3}).\n\u0003\nCorollary 3.4.2. Td,n is a smooth projective rational variety of dimension dn \u2212 d \u2212 1.\nProof. This follows from induction on n, with base case proven in\nProposition 3.4.1 and inductive step given by Theorem 3.3.1.\n\u0003\nProposition 3.4.3. T1,n \u223c\n= M 0,n+1 .\n13\n\n\fProof. Since each n pointed stable 1-RTPS is exactly an (n+1)-pointed\nstable curve (where the root hyperplane is identified with the (n + 1)st\n+\nmarking), the family Td,n\n\u2192 Td,n gives a morphism Td,n \u2192 M 0,n which\nis bijective on k points. To show this is an isomorphism, it suffices to\nconstruct an inverse morphism.\nTo do this, consider the Fulton-MacPherson configuration space P1 [n],\nand the divisor D(N) on P1 [n]. By Definition 3.1.1, we may identify\nT1,n with a fiber of the natural morphism D(N) \u2192 P1 . By [MM] (pages\n4,5), there is a natural isomorphism M 0,n (P1 , 1) \u223c\n= P1 [n]. Note that by\n[FP] (Theorem 2, part 3), M 0,n (P1 , 1) is actually a fine moduli space\nfor stable maps of degree 1 to P1 . The isomorphism from [MM] identifies the divisor D(N) with the stable maps f : (C, p1, . . . , pn ) \u2192 P1\nwhich take all the marked points to a given point x \u2208 P1 . The natural\nmorphism D(N) \u2192 P1 is simply the morphism taking this stable map\nto x. For such a stable map, the semistable curve C must have the\nform:\nD1\nD2\n\nD4\n\n1\n0\n1\n0\n11\n00\n\n1\n0\n1\n0\n\n1\n0\n1\n0\n\nD3\n\n11\n00\n\n1\n0\n0\n1\n\nC'\n\nq\n\nSince M 0,n (P1 , 1) is a fine moduli space, one may check that the\nfiber over a given point x \u2208 P1 is also a fine moduli space for (n + 1)pointed stable curves. To see this, suppose we have a stable map\nf : (C, p1, . . . , pn ) \u2192 P1 in this fiber, where the semistable curve C has\nirreducible components C \u2032 , D1 , . . . , Dr , with f\u2217 ([C \u2032 ]) = 1, f\u2217 ([Di ]) = 0.\nSince none of the marked points pi may lie on C \u2032 , the curve remaining\nafter forgetting C \u2032 , composed of the union of the Di , is a (n+1)-pointed\nstable rational curve where the (n + 1)st marking is obtained from the\npoint where \u222aDi intersects C \u2032 . This gives an isomorphism of the fiber\nover x with M 0,n+1 which is inverse to the morphism above.\n\u0003\nTheorem 3.4.4. The points of Td,n are in one to one correspondence\nwith isomorphism classes of n-pointed stable rooted trees of d-dimensional\nprojective spaces.\nProof. Let X[n]+ \u2192 X[n] be the \"universal family\" as described in\n[FM94]. By base change over Td,n \u2192 X[n] (included by choosing a\n+\npoint x \u2208 X), we obtain a flat family Td,n\n\u2192 Td,n . It follows from the\ndescription in [FM94] that the fibers are all n pointed stable d-RTPS's,\nexactly one in each isomorphism class.\n\u0003\n14\n\n\f3.5. Ample divisor classes on Td,n . Although by 3.4.2, we know\nabstractly that Td,n is a projective variety, it is often useful to have\nan explicit presentation of an ample divisor. We exhibit such a divisor\nbelow:\nTheorem 3.5.1. Let \u03b4S = [Td,n (S)] in the Chow group of Td,n as in\nremark 3.3.4. Then for S \u2282 N, |S| \u2265 2, the divisor classes\nX\n\u03b7S =\n\u03b4T\nN \u2287T \u2287S\n\nis nef and base point free. Furthermore, any expression of the form\nX\nA=\ncS \u03b7S\nS\u2282N,|S|\u22652\n\nis very ample provided cS > 0 for all S.\n\nProof. By [FM94], we have for any smooth d-dimensional variety X,\nan embedding\nY\ni : X[n] \u0592\u2192\nBl\u2206S (X S ),\nS\u2282N,|S|\u22652\n\nS\n\nwhere \u2206S \u2282 X is the (small) diagonal. Let iS be the morphism i\ncomposed with the projection map onto the factor Bl\u2206S (X S ). If AS\nis an very ample class on Bl\u2206S (X S ), then it follows immediately that\ni\u2217S (AS ) is nef and base\nfree (since it is the pullback of a very ample\nP point\ndivisor), and that\ncS i\u2217S (AS ) is very ample on X[n] if each cS > 0\n(since it is the pullback of a very ample divisor via an embedding).\nLet BS\u2032 be a very ample divisor class on X S , and let IS be the\nideal sheaf of \u2206S in OX S . Let fS : Bl\u2206S (X S ) \u2192 X S be the natural projection. Then fS\u22121 (IS ) is an invertible sheaf and the divisor\nclass \u03bbfS\u2217 BS + c1 (f \u22121 (IS )) is very ample for some \u03bb > 0 (see [Har77],\nProposition 7.10(b) and the proof of 7.13(a)). Let BS = \u03bbBS\u2032 . Then\n\u0010\n\u0001\u0011\n\u03b1S = i\u2217S fS\u2217 BS + c1 f \u22121 (IS )\nis nef and base point free. Fix for the remainder of the proof integers\ncS > 0. Then\n\u0010\nX\n\u0001\u0011\n\u03b1=\ni\u2217S fS\u2217 BS + c1 f \u22121 (IS )\nS\u2282N,|S|\u22652\n\nis very ample on X[n].\n\nj\n\nNow consider the embedding Td,n \u0592\u2192 X[n], and let jS be the composition with the projection to Bl\u2206S (X S ). Let \u03b7S = j \u2217 \u03b1S , and A = j \u2217 \u03b1.\nSince j is an embedding, \u03b7S is nef and base point free and A is very\n15\n\n\fample. We will be done once we show that the divisors \u03b7S have the\ndesired form. To begin, we may rewrite \u03b7S in the following way:\n\u0001\n\u03b7S = j \u2217 \u03b1S = fS\u2217 BS + c1 fS\u22121 (IS )\n\u0001\n= j \u2217 i\u2217S fS\u2217 BS + j \u2217 c1 i\u2217S fS\u22121 (IS )\n\u0001\n= (fS \u25e6 iS \u25e6 j)\u2217 BS \u2212 j \u2217 c1 i\u2217S fS\u22121 (IS )\nExamining the second term, we see by lemma 7.2.1, that i\u2217S fS\u22121 (IS ) =\n(fS \u25e6 iS )\u22121 (IS ), and by [FM94], page 203, if we let I(D(S))\nbe the\nQ\n\u22121\nideal sheaf of D(S) \u2282 X[n], we have (fS \u25e6 iS ) (IS ) = T \u2283S I(D(T )).\nConsequently, taking first Chern classes and applying j \u2217 , we have:\nX\nX\nX\n\u0001\nj \u2217 c1 i\u2217S fS\u22121 (IS ) = j \u2217\nc1 (I(D(T ))) = j \u2217\n\u2212[D(T )] = \u2212\n\u03b4T .\nT \u2283S\n\nT \u2283S\n\nT \u2283S\n\nOn the other hand, looking at the first term, (fS \u25e6 iS \u25e6 j)\u2217 BS , we see\nthat since the morphism (fS \u25e6 iS \u25e6 j) factors through a morphism to\nSpec(k), whose Picard group is the zero group, this pullback must in\nfact vanish. Therefore we have\nX\n\u03b7S =\n\u03b4T ,\nS\u2282T \u2282N\n\nas desired.\n\n\u0003\n\n3.6. A relative version of Td,n . It will be useful in what follows to\nhave a relative version of construction of Td,n . This follows without\nmuch technical difficulty and we leave some of the routine verifications\nto the reader.\nDefinition 3.6.1. Let V be a rank d vector bundle over a scheme X.\nWe define the functor TV,n from the category (Sch/X)op of X-schemes\nto the category of sets as follows. For h : H \u2192 X, we define TX,n (H) to\nbe the set of collections {\u03c6T : h\u2217 V \u2192 LT }T \u2208N,|T |\u22652, such that the \u03c6T 's\nform a compatible collection of screens (in the same sense as in 3.2.1).\nNote that there is a canonical morphism (natural transformation) from\nTV,n to X.\nBy setting TV,1 = X, TV,2 = P rojX (Sym\u2022V ), we may inductively dei\nfine varieties TV,n , FV,n\n, FV,n (S + ) such that the following theorem holds:\ni\nTheorem 3.6.2. There is a sequence of schemes FV,n\n, for 0 \u2264 i \u2264 n,\ni\n+\nwith subschemes FV,n (T ) indexed by T ( N , |T | \u2265 2 and morphisms\ni+1\ni\nbi : FV,n\n\u2192 FV,n\nsuch that:\n\n16\n\n\f0\nn\n(1) FV,n\n= TV,n and FV,n\n= TV,n+1 ,\n1\n0\n(2) the morphism b0 : FV,n\n\u2192 FV,n\n= TV,n is a projective bundle\nmorphism of relative dimension d,\n(3) the morphisms bi for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n \u2212 1 are blowups along the union\ni\ni\nof the subschemes FV,n\n(S + ), and FV,n\n(S + ) \u223c\n= TV,s \u00d7X TV,n\u2212s+1\nn\u22121\n+ \u223c\nif i 6= n \u2212 1 and FV,n ({a} ) = TV,n ,\n(4) TV,n is represented by TV,n .\n\nThe proof of this theorem takes the following steps. First, we see\nthat it holds in the case that V is a trivial bundle by noting that\nthe inductive construction of the space Td,n+1 from Td,n by taking a\nprojective bundle and blowing up may be fibered with a scheme X to\ngive an inductive construction of Td,n+1 \u00d7 X = TV,n+1 from Td,n \u00d7 X =\ni\nTV,n . For a general bundle, we may define the functors FV,n\n(S + ) by\n+\n+\nemulating the definition of X [n, i](N , S ), and note that they are\nlocally represented subschemes over subsets where V is trivial, and\ni\nthat these subschemes glue to give a closed subscheme FV,n\n(S + ). We\ni+1\ni\ndefine FV,n\nto be the blowup along the subschemes FV,n\n(S + ) where\n|S| = i. Since these have the correct functorial description locally, we\ni+1\ni+1\nmay glue and conclude that FV,n\nrepresents the functor FV,n\n.\nWe note the following lemmas which will be useful in Section 4:\nLemma 3.6.3. Let V be a vector bundle on X, and let \u03c0 : TV,n \u2192 X\nbe the natural projection. Then TV,n \u00d7X TV,m = T\u03c0\u2217 TV,n ,m .\nLemma 3.6.4. Let X be any scheme, and let V be a trivial vector\nbundle of rank d on X. Then Td,n \u00d7 X \u223c\n= TV,n . In particular, if\nX = Spec(k) then TV,n \u223c\n= Td,n .\nLemma 3.6.5. Let X be a smooth variety and let D(S) \u2282 X[n] be the\ndivisor on the Fulton-MacPherson configuration space described in the\nbeginning of the section. If \u03c0 : D(S) \u2192 X[n \u2212 |S| + 1] = X[(N \\ S) \u222a\n{a}] is the natural morphism from projecting with respect to the subset\n(N \\ S) \u222a{a} where a \u2208 S, and f : X[(N \\ S) \u222a{a}] \u2192 X the projection\nwith respect to a, then there is a natural isomorphism D(S) = Tf \u2217 \u03a9X ,s .\nThe proofs of these are elementary and follow from an examination\nof the functorial descriptions of the spaces involved.\nRemark 3.6.6. The morphism Td,n+1 \u2192 Td,n obtained by composing\nthe morphisms bi of theorem 3.6.2 is given functorially by dropping all\nscreens for subsets S \u2282 N + which contain the (n + 1)st marking. In\nthe future, we denote this morphism by \u03c0n+1 . We may similarly define\nmorphism \u03c0i for any i \u2208 N + by dropping the ith marking.\n17\n\n\f4. Inductive presentations of Chow groups and motives\nWe consider the Chow group of a variety X as a graded abelian\ngroup A(X) = A\u2217 (X). We use the following general conventions. For\na graded abelian group M = \u2295i\u2208Z Mi , we set M(n) to be the group with\ngrading shifted so that (M(n))i = Mn\u2212i . The grading on the tensor\nproduct M \u2297 N = M \u2297Z N is given by (M \u2297 N)n = \u2295i+j=n Mi \u2297 Nj .\nWe write Z for the graded abelian group with the integers in degree 0\nand zero in all other degrees.\nRemark 4.0.7. All the constructions used in this section are motivic:\nin other words, if the reader prefers, they may interpret A(X) as M(X),\nthe Chow motive of X (as in [Man68]), M(i) to be M twisted i times\nwith the Lefschetz motive, and Z to be the motive of Spec(k).\nIn this notation we have the following well known facts:\nLemma 4.0.8. For V a vector bundle of rank d on X,\nA(P (V )) =\n\nd\u22121\nM\n\nA(X)(i) = A(X) \u2297 (\n\ni=0\n\nd\u22121\nM\n\nZ(i)) = A(X) \u2297 A(Pd\u22121 ).\n\ni=0\n\nProof. [Ful98] for Chow groups, [Man68] for Chow motives.\n\n\u0003\n\nLemma 4.0.9. For Z \u0592\u2192 X a regularly embedded subvariety of codimension d,\nA(BlZ X) = A(X) \u2295\n\nd\u22121\nM\ni=1\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\nA(Z)(i) = A(X) \u2295 A(Z) \u2297 A(Pd\u22122 (1)) .\n\nProof. [Man68]\n\n\u0003\n\nOne technical difficulty which makes the computation of Chow groups\nmore difficult than the computation of cohomology is the fact that the\nChow group of a product X \u00d7 Y is not easily expressible in terms of\nthe Chow groups of X and Y . Philosophically, we show in this section\nthat products (and certain fiber bundles) with Td,n as one of the factors\nare not subject to this difficulty.\n4.1. The Chow groups and motives of Td,n .\n18\n\n\fTheorem 4.1.1. Let V /X be a vector bundle of rank d. Then\n!\nd\nM\nA(TV,n+1 ) =\nA(TV,n )(j) \u2295\n\uf8eb\nd\nM\n\uf8ed\n\nj=0\n\nM\n\nj=1 S(N,|S|\u22652\n\n\uf8f6\n\nA(TV,|S| \u00d7 TV,n\u2212|S|+1)(j)\uf8f8 \u2295\n\nd\u22121 M\nM\n\nA(TV,n )(j)\n\nj=1 a\u2208N\n\n!\n\nProof. This is an immediate consequence of Theorem 3.6.2 together\nwith Lemmas 4.0.8 and 4.0.9.\n\u0003\nUsing Lemma 3.6.4 to identify Td,n \u00d7 B = TOBd ,n for a variety B, we\nobtain the following corollary:\nCorollary 4.1.2. Let V /X be a vector bundle of rank d. Then\n!\nd\nM\nA(Td,n+1 \u00d7 B) =\nA(Td,n \u00d7 B)(j) \u2295\n\uf8eb\nd\nM\n\uf8ed\n\nj=0\n\nM\n\nj=1 S(N,|S|\u22652\n\n\uf8f6\n\nA(Td,|S| \u00d7 Td,n\u2212|S|+1 \u00d7 B)(j)\uf8f8\u2295\n\nd\u22121 M\nM\n\nA(Td,n \u00d7 B)(j)\n\nj=1 a\u2208N\n\nIn particular, setting B = Spec(k), we obtain a presentation for\nthe Chow groups of Td,n+1 in terms of the Chow rings of varieties of\nthe form Td,t \u00d7 B for various values of t < n. These terms may be\nsuccessively reduced using corollary 4.1.2, eventually using the fact that\nA(T1,3 ) = A(P1 ) = Z \u2295 Z(1) or the fact A(Td,2 ) \u223c\n= A(Pd\u22121 ) = \u2295d\u22121\ni=0 Z(i)\nfrom Lemma 3.4.1.\n4.2. The Chow groups and motives of the Fulton-MacPherson\nconfiguration space. Fulton and MacPherson have given a compactification X[n] of the moduli space of n distinct points on a smooth\nvariety X as well as a presentation of the intersection ring of the space\nX[n]. They pose the following problem ([FM/Ann94], page 189):\n\"It would be interesting to find an explicit basis for the\nChow groups of Pm [n], preferably simple with respect\nto the intersection pairings, as Keel has done in the case\nm = 1.\"\nIn this section, we present an inductive presentation of the Chow\ngroups and motives of the spaces X[n] which parallels Keel's presentation in [Kee92].\n19\n\n!\n\n\fLet us begin by making an elementary observation. The blowup\nconstruction of the Fulton-MacPherson space described in Section 3\ngives X[n + 1] as a composition of blowups of X[n] \u00d7 X. In the same\nway, we easily obtain X[n+1]\u00d7B as a composition of blowups of X[n]\u00d7\nX \u00d7B for an arbitrary variety B. Together with the identifications from\nTheorem 3.1.2, part 1, this yields the following inductive presentation:\nTheorem 4.2.1. Let X be a smooth variety. Then\nA(X[n + 1] \u00d7 B) = A(X[n] \u00d7 X \u00d7 B)\u2295\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n!\nd\nd\u22121 M\nM M\nM\n\uf8ed\nA(D(S) \u00d7 B)(j)\uf8f8 \u2295\nA(X[n] \u00d7 B)(j)\nj=1 S(N,|S|\u22652\n\nj=1 a\u2208N\n\nAs before, the symbol A can stand either for the Chow group or\nthe Chow motive. In particular, setting B = Spec(k), we obtain a\npresentation for the Chow groups (or motives) of X[n + 1] in terms\nof the Chow groups (or motives) of the varieties D(S) and X[n] \u00d7 X.\nFrom Lemma 3.6.5, we have an isomorphism D(S) = TV,s , for a vector\nbundle V of rank d on X[n \u2212 s + 1]. These terms may be successively\nreduced using theorems 4.1.1 and 4.2.1, eventually yielding an answer\nin terms only of the Chow groups of X T for T = 1, . . . , n. In general\nthere is no known formula for the Chow groups of X T in terms of the\nChow groups of X, however, if X has a cellular decomposition (see\ndefinition 7.3.2), then it is true that A(X T ) = \u2297a\u2208T A(X).\n5. Betti numbers and Poincar\u00e9 polynomials\nIn this section, we analyze generating functions for the Betti numbers\nand Poincar\u00e9 polynomials of the varieties Td,n in the case when k = C.\nBy Corollary 7.3.4, the Betti numbers coincide with the ranks of the\nChow groups, and therefore, since the presentation of the Chow groups\nof Td,n is independent of the underlying field k, these determine the\nChow groups in general. A recursive description of these polynomials\nwas given in [FM94] for the spaces X[n]. In [Man95], Manin relates\nthe Poincar\u00e9 polynomials of these spaces as well as the polynomials\nfor M 0,n to solutions to certain differential and functional equations.\nWe apply Manin's ideas here to obtain similar results for Td,n , which\nspecialize to Manin's original result for M 0,n+1 in the case d = 1.\nIndeed, the defining equations for the generating functions of Td,n\ndescribed here are identical to those discussed by Manin (Theorem\n0.4.1) in his analysis of the Poincar\u00e9 polynomials of X[n]. In our case,\nwe recover these equations from the explicit blowup construction of\n20\n\n\fTd,n , just as one can recover Theorem 0.3.1 of Manin from the blowup\nconstruction of M 0,n of Keel.\nFor a smooth\ncompact variety Z, denote its Poincar\u00e9 polynomial by\nP\nPZ (q) = j dim H j (Z)q j . In particular, put\n\u03bam = PPm\u22121 (q) =\n\nq 2m \u2212 1\n.\nq2 \u2212 1\n\nFix d, and for n \u2265 2, denote by Pn (q) = PTd,n (q) the Poincar\u00e9 polynomial of Td,n . From corollary 7.3.4 and the inductive presentation of\nthe Chow groups of Td,n in section 4.1, we have the following recursion\nfor the Poincar\u00e9 polynomials Pn (q).\nX\n\u0001\nn\n(1) Pn+1 (q) = (\u03bad+1 + nq 2 \u03bad\u22121 )Pn (q) + q 2 \u03bad\nPi (q)Pj (q)\ni\ni+j=n+1\n2\u2264i\u2264n\u22121\n\nPn (q)\nDefining P1 (q) = 1, and defining pn = pn (q) =\n, this is equivalent\nn!\nto either of the recursions:\nX\n(n + 1)pn+1 = (\u03bad+1 + nq 2 \u03bad\u22121 )pn + q 2 \u03bad\njpi pj\n(n+1)pn+1 = (\u03bad+1 +nq 2 \u03bad\u22121 )pn +q 2 \u03bad\n\nX\n\ni+j=n+1\n2\u2264i\u2264n\u22121\n\njpi pj \u2212q 2 \u03bad npn \u2212q 2 \u03bad pn .\n\ni+j=n+1\ni\u22651\n\nThe fact that \u03bad+1 = 1 + q 2 \u03bad , q 2 \u03bad\u22121 = \u03bad \u2212 1, and that q 2 \u03bad =\nq \u2212 1 + \u03bad shows that the recursion in (1) can be rewritten as:\nX\n(2) (n + 1)pn+1 (q) = (1 \u2212 nq 2d )pn (q) + q 2 \u03bad\njpi (q)pj (q).\n2d\n\ni+j=n+1\ni\u22651\n\nConsider the following generating function, recalling that p1 (q) = 1:\nX\nX\n\u03c8(q, t) = t +\npn (q)tn =\npn (q)tn .\nn\u22652\n\nn\u22651\n\nTheorem 5.0.2. \u03c8(q, t) is the unique root in t + t2 Q[q][[t]] of the following functional equation in t with parameter q:\n(3)\n\n\u03bad (1 + \u03c8)q\n\n2d\n\n= q 2d+2 \u03bad \u03c8 \u2212 q 2d (q 2d \u2212 1)t + \u03bad\n\nor the following differential equation in t with parameter q:\n(4)\n\n(1 + q 2d t \u2212 q 2 \u03bad \u03c8)\u03c8t = 1 + \u03c8.\n\nProof. First, note that we get (4) from (3) by differentiating in t. Moreover, we can see that the equations are equivalent to the recursion (1)\n21\n\n\fP\nor (2). In particular, since \u03c8t (q, t) = n\u22651 npn (q)tn\u22121 , the tn term for\nn \u2265 1 of the left hand side of the differential equation is\nX\n(n + 1)pn+1 + q 2d npn \u2212 q 2 \u03bad\njpj pi\ni+j=n+1\ni\u22651,j\u22651\n\nwhich is equal to pn by (2), and for n = 0 is p1 = 1. This is exactly\nthe statement of the theorem.\n\u0003\nP\nFix d \u2265 1 and define the generating function \u03b7(t) = t+ n\u22652 \u03c7(Td,n ).\nCorollary 5.0.3. \u03b7(t) is the unique root in t + t2 Q[q][[t]] of any of the\nfollowing equations:\nd(1 + \u03b7) log(1 + \u03b7) = (d + 1)\u03b7 \u2212 t\n(1 + t \u2212 d\u03b7)\u03b7t = 1 + \u03b7.\nProof. Differentiating the first equation gives the second. The result\nfollows since the Euler characteristic of a smooth compact variety Z\ncan be defined by \u03c7(Z) = Pz (\u22121) so that \u03b7(t) = \u03c8(\u22121, t).\n\u0003\n6. Chow Ring of Td,n and pairing between divisors and\ncurves\nIn this section we examine the structure of the Chow ring of the\nspace Td,n . Let k be an arbitrary field. We recall the definition of\nthe divisors Td,n (S) described in Section 3. Fix d \u2265 1, n \u2265 2, and\nlet \u03b4S = [Td,n (S)] be the corresponding cycle class in the Chow group\nA\u2217 (Td,n ). We obtain an explicit description of the Chow ring of Td,n\nby considering the Fulton-MacPherson configuration space Ad [n]. Let\ni : D(N) \u0592\u2192 Ad [n] be the inclusion of the divisor on Ad [N] where\nall the points coincide, and consider the morphism \u03c0 : D(N) \u2192 Ad .\nBy Definition 3.1.1, Td,n = \u03c0 \u22121 (0). Recall that by Proposition 3.3.3,\nTd,n \u00d7 Ad \u223c\n= D(N).\nThis implies that we may regard D(N) as a (trivial) vector bundle\nover Td,n , and therefore we have a morphism \u03c0 : D(N) \u2192 Td,n , and\na flat pullback inducing an isomorphism (\u03c0 \u2217 )\u22121 : A\u2217 D(N) \u223c\n= A\u2217 Td,n .\nIn particular, one may check from the definitions that if we let D(S)\nbe the divisor defined in [FM94] which we used in Section 3 then for\nS 6= N,\n\u03b4S = (\u03c0 \u2217 )\u22121 i! [D(S)].\n!\nWe may similarly define \u03b4N = (\u03c0 \u2217 )\u22121 iX\n[D(N)]. For any two distinct\nelements a and b \u2208 N, define \u03a3ab :=\n\u03b4{ab}\u222aS .\nS\u2282N \\{ab}\n\n22\n\n\fTheorem 6.0.4. A\u2217 (Td,n ) \u223c\n= Z[{\u03b4S }S\u2282N,2\u2264|S|\u2264n]/Id,n , where Id,n is the\nideal generated by:\n(1) \u03b4S * \u03b4T = 0 for all S, T \u2282 N, such that 2 \u2264 |S|, |T | and \u2205 =\n6\nS \u2229 T ( S, T ;\n(2) (\u03a3ij )d = 0, for all i,j \u2208 N.\nProof. This follows from immediately from [FM94], and the isomorphism A\u2217 (Td,n ) \u223c\n\u0003\n= A\u2217 (D(N)) above.\nIn the remainder of this section, we state and prove the following\npairing between 1-cycles and the boundary divisors.\nTheorem 6.0.5. For T ( N, |T | \u2265 2, define 1-cycles CT \u2208 A1 (Td,n )\nby\nd(|T |\u22121)\u22121\nd(n\u2212|T |)\u22121\nCT := \u03b4T\n* \u03b4N\n.\nIf S ( N, |S| \u2265 2, then\n\uf8f1\nd(n\u22121)\n\uf8f4\nif S=T;\n\uf8f2(\u22121)\nn\u22122\n\u03b4S * CT = (\u22121)\nif d = 1, |S| = 2, S ( T ;\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f30\notherwise.\n\nCorollary 6.0.6. For d > 1, the 1-cycles CT , |T | \u2265 2 form a Z-basis\nfor A1 (Td,n ). In the case d = 1, the 1-cycles CT , |T | \u2265 3 form a Z-basis\nfor A1 (T1,n ) = A1 (M 0,n+1 ).\n\nProof. First note that the set {\u03b4T }T \u2282N,|T |\u22653 forms a Z-basis for the\ncodimension 1-cycles on T1,n , and that the set {\u03b4T }T \u2282N,|T |\u22652 forms a\nZ-basis for the codimension 1-cycles on Td,n .\nNote that the ring described in the theorem does not depend on\nthe choice of the base field. The statement which we have to prove\nis independent of the choice of k, and we may assume without loss of\ngenerality that k = C. By Appendix 7.3.4, the space Td,n is an HI space.\nSince it is a compact smooth manifold with torsion free cohomology\ngroups, we obtain Poincar\u00e9 duality induced by the intersection pairing\nof divisors and curves. Therefore the CT 's form a dual integer basis to\nthe DT 's, up to sign.\n\u0003\nIn order to prove Theorem 6.0.5, we first establish several identities. For convenience, we denote by \u03b4i the divisor class \u03b4{1,2,...,i} . The\nfollowing is an immediate consequence of Theorem 6.0.4.\nLemma 6.0.7. For S, T \u2282 N, i \u2208 S, T , and l \u2208 T \\ S, we have\n\u03b4T * \u03b4S = 0 unless S \u2282 T . In particular, if l \u2208 T , then \u03b4T * \u03b4l\u22121 = 0\nunless {1, . . . , l} \u2282 T .\n23\n\n\fd(n\u2212|S|)\n\nLemma 6.0.8. For S ( N, |S| \u2265 2, \u03b4S * \u03b4N\nd(n\u2212j)\u22121\nS 6= N, |S| > j, then \u03b4S * \u03b4N\n= 0.\n\n= 0. Consequently, if\n\nProof. We proceed by induction on n \u2212 |S|. The base case n \u2212 |S| = 0\nholds trivially. Suppose that the result holds for n \u2212 |S| < k. Let\nS \u2282 N, |S| = n \u2212 k. Choose i \u2208 S and j 6\u2208 S. By Theorem 6.0.4, if\nj \u2208 T and i \u2208 S \u2229 T , then \u03b4T \u03b4S = 0 unless S ( T . Moreover, for such\nd(n\u2212|S|\u22121)\nT 6= N, \u03b4T \u03b4N\n= 0 by the inductive hypothesis. Therefore\nd(n\u2212|S|\u22121)\n\n0 = (\u03a3i,j\u2208T \u03b4T )d \u03b4S \u03b4N\n\nd(n\u2212|S|\u22121)\n\nd\n= \u03b4N\n\u03b4S \u03b4N\n\nd(n\u2212|S|)\n\n= \u03b4S \u03b4N\n\nsince (\u03a3ij )d = 0 by Theorem 6.0.4.\n\n\u0003\n\nLemma 6.0.9. Given 2 \u2264 j \u2264 n, if 1 \u2264 k < i \u2264 j, T \u2282 {1, . . . i},\n|T | = i \u2212 k, then\nd(n\u2212j)\u22121\n\nd\n\u03b4T * \u03b4ikd+1 * \u03b4i+1\n* * * \u03b4jd * \u03b4N\n\n= 0.\n\nProof. Renumbering the elements of T , it suffices to take \u03b4T = \u03b4i\u2212k .\nWe proceed by induction on k. For the base case k = 1, we proceed by\ninduction on j \u2212 i with base case i = j. By Lemma 6.0.7, if 1, j \u2208 T ,\nthen \u03b4T \u03b4j\u22121 = 0 unless {1, . . . , j} \u2282 T . Also note that by Lemma 6.0.8,\nd(n\u2212j)\u22121\nif T 6= N and |T | > j, then \u03b4T \u03b4N\n= 0.

If T ( S, then \u03b4S * CT = 0 by Lemma 6.0.8.\nSuppose S ( T .

From Lemma 3.4.1, we know that Td,2 \u223c\n= Pd\u22121 . As discussed in\nthe beginning of the section, [Td,2 ({1, 2})] corresponds to i\u2217 [D({1, 2})],\nwhere i is the inclusion D({1, 2}) \u0592\u2192 Ad [2]. By [Ful98], we have\ni\u2217 [D({1, 2})] = c1 (ND({1,2}) Ad [2]) = OD({1,2}) (\u22121).\nHence [Td,2 ({1, 2})] = c1 (OPd\u22121 (\u22121)), and the result follows.\nWrite T1,3 \u223c\n= P1 . As above, for i the inclusion D({1, 2, 3}) \u0592\u2192 A1 [3],\ni\u2217 [D({1, 2, 3})] corresponds to OP1 (\u22121) on T1,3 , which gives the result.\n\u0003\nLet \u03c0n+1 : Td,n+1 \u2192 Td,n be the map which drops the (n + 1)st\nmarking as described in Section 3.\n\u2217\n(\u03b4N,n ) = \u03b4N,n+1 + \u03b4N + ,n+1.\nLemma 6.0.14. \u03c0n+1\n\nProof.

Writing Fd,n\n= PTd,n (LN \u2295 VTd,n ), we may identify\n1\n1\nFd,n (N) \u2282 Fd,n with the subbundle PTd,n (VTd,n ).\n1\nProof. We recall that the functor defining Fd,n\ntakes a variety H to the\ncollection of compatible screens (iS : LS \u2192 (VH )S /VH ) where either\nS \u2282 N or S = N + . Equivalently, examining the proof of Theorem\n3.1.2, the data of iN + amounts to choosing a vector bundle inclusion\nj : LN + \u2192 LN \u2295VH . The morphism iN + is then obtained by using iN to\n+\nmap LN into (VH )N /V and identifying (VH )N /VH \u223c\n= (VH )N /VH \u2295 VH .\n1\nThe subfunctor represented by Fd,n (N) is defined by requiring that\nall the compatibility morphisms LN + \u2192 LS are zero for S \u2282 N. By\ncompatibility, it suffices to know that LN + \u2192 LN is zero, or that the\nmorphism j maps LN + entirely inside of VH \u2282 LN + \u2295 VH . But this just\n1\nsays that Fd,n\n(N) = PTd,n (VTd,n ) \u2282 PTd,n (LN \u2295 VTd,n ), as desired.\n\u0003\n1\nLemma 6.0.17. Let \u03c1 : Td,n+1 \u2192 Fd,n\nbe the natural projection. Then\n\u2217\n1\n\u03c1 ([Fd,n (N)]) = [Td,n+1 (N)].\n1\nProof. We first note that scheme-theoretically \u03c1\u22121 (Fd,n\n(N)) = Td,n+1 (N).\n1\nTo see this, we note that a morphism from a scheme H to \u03c1\u22121 (Fd,n\n(N))\nis given by specifying a collection of compatible screens (LS \u2192 (VH )S /VH )\nfor S \u2282 N + such that the compatibility morphism LN + \u2192 LN is zero.\nBut it is easy to check that this is precisely equivalent to the morphism\nbeing in Td,n+1 (N).\n1\nNow the pullback \u03c1\u2217 ([Fd,n\n(N)]) is represented by a class on the\nscheme theoretic inverse image. Since \u03c1 is of relative dimension zero,\nthe pullback is represented by a multiple of the fundamental class of\nthe inverse image [Td,n+1 (N)]. But since \u03c1\u2217 \u03c1\u2217 = id, this multiple must\nbe 1.\n\u0003\n\n28\n\n\fLemma 6.0.18.

Appendix\n7.1. An intersection-theoretic Lemma.\nLemma 7.1.1. Let X be a variety, and suppose \u03c0 : E \u2192 X is a vector\nbundle of rank d + 1 and V \u2282 E is a rank d subvector bundle. Consider\nthe inclusion i : P (V ) \u0592\u2192 P (E). Then \u03c0\u2217 ((i\u2217 [P (V )])d ) = [X] in the\nChow group of X.\nIn the proof of this fact we omit the i\u2217 for notational convenience.\nProof. Let us first consider the case where E = L \u2295 V for some trivial\nline bundle L. By [Ful98], Lemma 3.3, c1 (OE (1)) \u2229 [P (E)] = [P (V )].\nUsing [Ful98], Proposition 3.1, we have [X] = s0 (E) \u2229 [X]. But by the\ndefinition of the Segre class, we have:\n[X] = s0 (E) \u2229 [X] = \u03c0\u2217 (c1 (OE (1))d \u2229 [P (E)])\n= \u03c0\u2217 ([P (V )]d \u2229 [P (E)]) = \u03c0\u2217 ([P (V )]d )\nNow let us consider the general case. By counting dimensions, we know\nthat \u03c0\u2217 ([P (V )]d ) \u2208 Adim(X) (X) = Z[X], and so \u03c0\u2217 ([P (V )]d ) = a[X]\nfor some a \u2208 Z. We show that a = 1. Choose an open subvariety\nj : U \u0592\u2192 X such that E|U = L|U \u2295 V |U for some trivial line bundle L.\n30\n\n\fWe have a commutative diagram:\nP (V |U )\njV\n\niU\n\n\u2732\n\njE\n\n\u2744\n\nP (V )\n\nP (E|U )\n\n\u2732\ni\n\n\u03c0U\n\nU\nj\n\n\u2744\n\nP (E)\n\n\u2732\n\n\u03c0\n\n\u2732\n\n\u2744\n\nX\n\nNow we observe that j \u2217 \u03c0\u2217 ([P (V )]d ) = j \u2217 (a[X]) = a[U]. But by [Ful98]\nPropositions 1.7 and 2.3(d), this gives:\na[U] = j \u2217 \u03c0\u2217 ([P (V )]d ) = (\u03c0U )\u2217 jE\u2217 ([P (V )]d )\n\n\u0001\n= (\u03c0U )\u2217 (jE\u2217 [P (V )])d = (\u03c0U )\u2217 ([P (V |U )]d )\n\nBut by the first case, we have (\u03c0U )\u2217 ([P (V |U )]d ) = [U], which implies\nthat a = 1.\n\u0003\n7.2. Inverse image of a height 1 prime ideal sheaf.\nLemma 7.2.1. Suppose f : X \u2192 Y is a dominant morphism of varieties and I \u2282 OY is the ideal sheaf of a codimension 1 subvariety\nZ \u2282 Y . If Y is locally factorial then the canonical map of coherent\nsheaves f \u2217 (I) \u2192 f \u22121 (I) is an isomorphism.\nProof. The result is local, and so we may assume that X = Spec(S), Y =\nSpec(R), and I = Ie for an ideal I \u2282 R. By the hypotheses we may\nalso assume that R and S are domains, \u03c6 is injective, and that R is\nfactorial, and therefore by [Eis95], Corollary 10.6, I = aR for some\na \u2208 R. Let \u03c6 : R \u2192 S be the map induced by f . Then we need to\nshow that I \u2297R S \u223c\n= \u03c6(I)S, where the isomorphism is induced by the\nmultiplication map. Since I = aR, this amounts to showing that the\nmorphism S \u2192 S induced by multiplication by \u03c6(a) is injective. But\nthis is true since \u03c6 is injective and S is a domain.\n\u0003\n7.3. HI Spaces. In this section we show that if the ground field is the\ncomplex numbers, then the Chow groups of Td,n are isomorphic to the\nhomology (and cohomology) groups.\nDefinition 7.3.1. A complex algebraic variety X is an HI space if the\ncanonical map clX : Ai (X) \u2192 H2i (X) is an isomorphism.\nDefinition 7.3.2. A variety X is cellular if it is has a filtration X0 (\nX1 ( * * * ( Xn = X, such that Xi \\ Xi\u22121 is a disjoint union of affine\nspaces Ai .\n31\n\n\fIf X has a cellular decomposition then it is an HI space. This fact\ncan be found in [Ful98], example 19.1.11(b). Also, if Y \u2282 X is a closed\nsubscheme, U = X \\ Y the open complement, and clY , and clU are\nboth isomorphisms, then so is clX . That is, Y, U both HI implies X\nHI. This is in [Ful98], example 19.1.11(a). It is also easy to check that\nif X is a projective bundle over Y , and Y is an HI space, then so is X.\nWe recall the following fact:\nTheorem 7.3.3 ([Kee92]). Suppose Y is a closed subvariety of X, and\nX and Y are both HI. Then The blowup of X along Y is also HI.\nFrom this, our description of the space Td,n as a blowup of a projective bundle shows that:\nCorollary 7.3.4. Td,n is an HI space.\nWe similarly have:\nCorollary 7.3.5. Suppose that if X is an HI space. Then so is the\nFulton-MacPherson configuration space X[n].\nReferences\n[Eis95]\n[FM94]\n[FP]\n[Ful98]\n\n[GKM02]\n[Har77]\n[HKT]\n[Kap93a]\n\n[Kap93b]\n[Kee92]\n[KT]\n[Man68]\n\nDavid Eisenbud.
