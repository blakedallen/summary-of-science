For example, the quantum key distribution has\nrecently become an industrial product [2]. These developments caused a great burst of activity in investigation of\nquantum entanglement. During the last decade, the applications of entanglement to quantum information and\nquantum computing were discussed in a huge number of\narticles and review papers, in particular in Foundations\nof Physics [3].\nNevertheless, the substance of entanglement still remains unclear, especially beyond the simplest case of twoqubit systems. Moreover, there is a certain muddle even\nin the very definition of entanglement because important\nand inessential are often jumbled together.\nIn this paper, our aim is not to discuss the applications\nbut the physics behind the quantum entanglement.\nFor example, entanglement is usually associated with\nquantum nonlocality or violation of classical realism [4,\n5, 6]. This simply means that measurements on spatially\nseparated parts of a quantum system may instantaneously\ninfluence one another. Physically this is caused by the\nquantum correlations between the parts of the system[6].\nOnce created, those correlations keep on existing even\nafter the spatial separation of parts.\nOn one hand, the nonlocality is probably the main\ndistinguishing feature of quantum mechanics regarding\nclassical physics. On the other hand, this notion does\nnot contain any quantification of distance between separated entangled parts of a quantum system. Thus, it\nseems to be natural to assume that quantum system with\nstrongly correlated intrinsic parts may manifest entanglement independent of distance between the parts and\nhence even as a local object without spatial separation\nof parts [1, 7, 8, 9, 10].\nThe quantum nonlocality is often expressed in terms\n\nof violation of different Bell-type conditions of classical\nrealism [6]. This violation is a characteristic feature of\nentanglement in two-qubit systems. However, unentangled states of some systems beyond two qubits can also\nmanifest the violation of those conditions [11, 12, 13].\nFor example, the difference between entangled and unentangled states disappears for systems with dynamic symmetry group SU(H) with dimension of the Hilbert space\ndim H \u2265 3 (see Ref. [14], cf. [15]). As a matter of fact,\nviolation of Bell-type conditions generally indicates the\nabsence of \"hidden\" classical variables in quantum mechanics [6] rather than entanglement (also see Appendix\nA).\nThis allows us to conclude that nonlocality and violation of classical realism alone are not the essential sign\nof entanglement and that there is no physical prohibition\nfor the existence of entanglement of local objects (particles) caused by quantum correlations of their intrinsic\ndegrees of freedom[1, 7, 8, 9, 10].\nAnother common opinion is that the entanglement of\nmultipartite systems defined in the Hilbert space H =\nHA \u2297HB \u2297* * * can be associated with the nonseparability\nof states \u03c8 \u2208 H with respect to the parts of the system\n(e.g., see [16]).\nThis statement, which is undoubtedly valid in the case\nof bipartite systems, does not have a lucid sense for multipartite entanglement. Stress that the notion of nonseparability is clearly useless in the case of single-particle\nentanglement, [9, 10].\nThree-qubit states, whose classification has been constructed in Ref. [17] can be considered as an example. Namely, the states from the class, specified by the\nnonseparable GHZ (Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger) state,\nmanifest only three-partite entanglement with no correlations (entanglement) between pairs of qubits. In contrast, the nonseparable W-states manifest entanglement\nonly between pairs of qubits while they are unentangled in the three-qubit sector. In turn, the so-called biseparable states (separable with respect to one of the parties) may manifest bipartite entanglement. For details,\n\n\f2\nsee Appendix B.\nThus, it seems reasonable to set aside the criteria of\nentanglement based on nonlocality, violation of classical\nrealism, and nonseparability, and to focus attention on\nphysical manifestations of entanglement in the process of\nmeasurement of quantum observables.\nNote first that there is a certain interdependence between quantum correlations peculiar to entangled states\nand quantum uncertainties (fluctuations) of local observables [11, 18, 19]. Consider as an illustrative example the measurement of spin projection onto the quantization axis in the two-qubit\nstates |\u03c8\u2191\u2191 i = | \u2191\u2191i and\n\u221a\n|\u03c8CE i = (| \u2191\u2191i + | \u2193\u2193i)/ 2. For the correlation functions\nand variances (uncertainties), we get\nh\u03c8\u2191\u2191 |\u03c3zA ; \u03c3zB |\u03c8\u2191\u2191 i = 0, V (\u03c3zA,B ; \u03c8\u2191\u2191 ) = 0,\nh\u03c8CE |\u03c3zA ; \u03c3zB |\u03c8CE i = 1, V (\u03c3zA,B ; \u03c8CE ) = 1.\nHere \u03c3zA , \u03c3zB denote the z-component of Pauli spin operator,\nh\u03c8|\u03c3 A ; \u03c3 B |\u03c8i = h\u03c8|\u03c3 A \u03c3 B |\u03c8i \u2212 h\u03c8|\u03c3 A |\u03c8ih\u03c8|\u03c3 B |\u03c8i\nis the correlation function of local measurements, and\nV (\u03c3; \u03c8) = h\u03c8|\u03c3 2 |\u03c8i \u2212 h\u03c8|\u03c3|\u03c8i2\nis the variance of the observable \u03c3 in the state \u03c8. Thus,\nthe correlation functions and variances have similar behavior for the characteristic states like \u03c8\u2191\u2191 and \u03c8CE .\nThe natural question now is how many physical observables should be measured in order to conclude that\na given state of a certain system is entangled [20]? This\nquestion has extremely high importance for understanding of physical essence of entanglement and its quantification. Besides that, this question has a quite practical\nmeaning in connection with test of sources of entangled\nstates [21].\nIn a recent approach [7, 11, 22] (for recent review, see\nRef. [1]), it has been proposed to begin the analysis of\nentanglement with the choice of independent basic observables that can be associated with the orthogonal basis of a certain Lie algebra L. The corresponding Lie\ngroup G = exp(iL) defines the dynamic symmetry of the\nphysical system under consideration.\nIt should be emphasized that the idea to specify a\nquantum system by accessible observables is known for\na long time (e.g., see [23]). Unfortunately, this principle\nidea is often set aside. As we show below in this paper,\nthis principle plays extremely important role in description of quantum entanglement.\nWithin the approach of Refs. [7, 11, 22], the complete\nentanglement is interpreted as manifestation of quantum\nuncertainties of all basic observables at their extreme. By\ncomplete entanglement we mean here the maximal entanglement that can be achieved by pure states.\nNote that, for a given quantum system, it is enough\nto know the completely entangled states because all\nother entangled states can be generated from those states\n\nthrough the use of SLOCC (stochastic local operations\nassisted by classical communications) [24, 25].\nThe dual objective of present paper is to discuss the\ncharacteristic features of this approach, using a single\nqutrit (ternary quantum state) as an illustrative example of some considerable interest, and hence to justify\nexistence of single-particle entanglement.\nQutrit is usually associated with ternary unit of quantum information [26]. Instructiveness of this example\nconsists in the relativity of entanglement with respect\nto the choice of dynamic symmetry G of ternary quantum physical system. Namely, one can choose either\nG = SU(3) [27] or G\u2032 = SU(2). Just the latter case of a\nsingle spin-1 system may manifest entanglement without\ndivision of the system into separated parts [7, 9, 10].\nStress that entanglement of a single photon has been\ndiscussed for a long time [28]. The picture always involves an external qubit formed by two possible paths\nowing to its propagation through a beam splitter. In\ncontrast, our concept of the single-particle entanglement\n[1, 10] considers particle itself independent of its environment (see also important discussions in Refs. [8, 9]). In\nthis case, quantum correlations peculiar to entanglement\ncan be associated with intrinsic degrees of freedom of a\nparticle.\nIn the paper, we show that the single-particle entanglement has all important properties of conventional\ntwo-qubit entanglement. In particular, its unentangled\nstates are the spin-coherent states like those of two\nqubits [11, 12] (concerning spin-coherent states, see the\nbasic works [29] and monographs [30]). In turn, the\nsingle-particle entangled states are squeezed like the twoqubit entangled states (for relation between squeezing\nand \"conventional\" multipartite entanglement, see Refs.\n[31]).\nNote that association of unentangled and coherent\nstates on the one hand and entangled and squeezed states\non the other hand blends well with the concept of entanglement as manifestation of quantum uncertainties at\ntheir extreme.\nWe also reveal the mechanism of intrinsic quantum correlations hidden behind the single-qutrit entanglement.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section II, the\nprinciples of the dynamic symmetry approach to quantum entanglement are presented and we show existence\nof the single-particle entanglement for spin-1 systems. In\nSection III, we discuss properties of that entanglement.\nThen, in Section IV, we consider some physical realizations. The conclusions are given in Section V.\n\nII.\n\nENTANGLEMENT AND QUANTUM\nFLUCTUATIONS\n\nAs we have said in Introduction, specifying a given\nquantum system, we should first choose the accessible independent physical observables associated with dynamic\nsymmetry of the system [1, 11].\n\n\f3\nFor example, in the case of a qubit (spin 1/2) system, dynamic symmetry is given by the group SU(2).\nThe orthogonal basis of the corresponding Lie algebra\nsu(2) consists of three spin operators (Pauli matrices).\nThus, a two-qubit system is characterized by the dynamic symmetry G = SU(2) \u00d7 SU(2), which corresponds\nto the six basic observables (three Pauli matrices for each\npart). For the two-qubit pure state, the number of necessary measurements, providing information about entanglement carried by this state, is reduced to three [20]\nbecause of the local character of the measure of entanglement (concurrence) in this case [32].\nTo illustrate special importance of the specification of\nquantum system by basic observables, consider a qutrit\n\n(ternary unit of quantum information) associated with a\nstate\n\n|\u03c8i =\n\n1\nX\n\ns=\u22121\n\n\u03c8s |si,\n\n1\nX\n\ns=\u22121\n\n|\u03c8s |2 = 1\n\n(1)\n\nin the three-dimensional Hilbert space H3 . As we have\nmentioned in Introduction, there are at least two qualitatively different physical systems, whose states are qutrits.\nNamely, one possible realization corresponds to the general symmetry G = SU(3) of the system, which implies\neight basic observables (Gell-Mann matrices) [27]\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n0 1 0\n0 \u2212i 0\n1 0 0\n0 0 1\n\u03bb1 = \uf8ed 1 0 0 \uf8f8 , \u03bb2 = \uf8ed i 0 0 \uf8f8 , \u03bb3 = \uf8ed 0 \u22121 0 \uf8f8 , \u03bb4 = \uf8ed 0 0 0 \uf8f8 ,\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n1 0 0\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 \u2212i\n1 0 0\n1\n\u03bb5 = \uf8ed 0 0 0 \uf8f8 , \u03bb6 = \uf8ed 0 0 1 \uf8f8 , \u03bb7 = \uf8ed 0 0 \u2212i \uf8f8 , \u03bb8 = \u221a \uf8ed 0 1 0 \uf8f8 .\n3 0 0 \u22122\n0 1 0\n0 i 0\ni 0 0\nHereafter we call the corresponding system the true qutrit\nsystem.\nAnother realization assumes reduced symmetry G\u2032 =\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n1 \uf8ed0 1 0\uf8f8\n1 0 1 ,\nSx = \u221a\n2 0 1 0\n\nV (Xi ; \u03c8) = h\u03c8|Xi2 |\u03c8i \u2212 h\u03c8|Xi |\u03c8i2 .\n\nSU(2) of the physical system, which requires only three\nbasic observables (spin-1 operators) [10]\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n1 \uf8ed 0 \u2212i 0 \uf8f8\ni 0 \u2212i ,\nSy = \u221a\n2 0 i 0\n\nWe call this case the spin-qutrit system.\nAs we discuss in the next Section, qutrit (1) may manifest entanglement in the case of single spin-qutrit system,\nwhile single true qutrit can never be entangled.\nBefore we begin to consider entanglement of a single\nqutrit, let us briefly discuss the physical definition of entanglement of Refs. [7, 11, 22].\nFor a given state \u03c8 of a system with basic observables\nXi , we can measure the expectation values h\u03c8|Xi |\u03c8i and\nvariances (uncertainties)\n(4)\n\nIt is interesting that Wigner and Yanase [33] have proposed a new quantity to measure specific quantum information about a state \u03c8, that can be obtained from\nmacroscopic measurement of the observable Xi in this\nstate (the so called Wigner-Yanase skew information):\n\n(2)\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n1 0 0\nSz = \uf8ed 0 0 0 \uf8f8 .\n0 0 \u22121\n\n1\n\u221a\nIW Y (Xi ; \u03c1) = \u2212 T r([ \u03c1, Xi ]2 ).\n2\n\n(3)\n\n(5)\n\nIn the case of pure state \u03c8, the density matrix takes the\nform \u03c1 = |\u03c8ih\u03c8|, the quantity (5) simply coincides with\nthe variance (4) (see Refs. [34] for further discussion of\nWigner-Yanase quantum \"skew information\").\nFollowing [7, 11, 22], introduce the total variance\nX\nV (Xi ; \u03c8)\n(6)\nV(\u03c8) =\ni\n\ncalculated for all basic observables and all parts of the\nsystem (in the case of multipartite systems). By definition, this quantity (6) is an invariant, independent of the\nchoice of basis of the Lie algebra L of observables. This\nquantity (6) can also be interpreted as the total amount\nof Wigner-Yanase information peculiar to the state \u03c8.\n\n\f4\nIt was proposed in Refs. [7, 11, 22] that, complete entangled states \u03c8CE of an arbitrary system can be defined\nin terms of maximum of total variance:\nV(\u03c8CE ) = max V(\u03c8).\n\u03c8\u2208H\n\n(7)\n\nAmount of entanglement carried by entangled states\n(8) can also be measured by means of total variance as\nfollows [35]\nV(\u03c8) \u2212 Vmin\n.\n(11)\nVmax \u2212 Vmin\nHere Vmax and Vmin denote the total variance for completely entangled and unentangled states, respectively.\nThis measure coincides with the concurrence [36] for pure\nstates of an arbitrary bipartite system. It can also be applied beyond bipartite systems. For unentangled states,\n\u03bc(\u03c8) = 0, while for entangled states it lies in (0, 1], so\nthat \u03bc(\u03c8CE ) = 1.\n\u03bc(\u03c8) =\n\nThis definition has a simple physical meaning. It associates complete entanglement with the maximal amount\nof quantum uncertainty in a given system. Validity of\nthis definition in some known cases of completely entangled states of multipartite systems has been shown in a\nnumber of papers (see Ref. [1] for references).\nIt is seen that Eq. (7) represents a certain variational\nprinciple, similar in a sense to the maximal entropy principle in statistical physics, which is used to define equilibrium states.\nAt first glance, Eq. (7) defines only completely entangled states \u03c8CE . In fact, it can be used to specify all\nentangled pure states of the system as well. The point is\nthat all entangled states of a given system are equivalent\nto SLOCC (stochastic local operations assisted by classical communications) [24, 25]. Note that SLOCC are\nrepresented by operators from the complexified dynamic\nsymmetry group [25]\n\\ \u2261 g c \u2208 Gc = exp(L \u2297 C).\nSLOCC\nThus, for the entangled states \u03c8E we get\n|\u03c8E i = g c |\u03a8CE i.\n\n(8)\n\nNote that in the case of compact Lie algebra (like\nSU(N )), the quadratic form\nX\nXi2 = CH\ni\n\nis a scalar (Casimir operator). Then Eq. (6) takes the\nform\nX\nh\u03c8|Xi |\u03c8i2 .\n(9)\nV(\u03c8) = CH \u2212\ni\n\nIt is easily seen that the maximum of the total variance\n(9) is provided by the condition\n\u2200i\n\nh\u03c8CE |Xi |\u03c8CE i = 0.\n\n(10)\n\nThis condition represents a set of algebraic equations for\nthe complex coefficients of the wave function |\u03c8i, which\nenables us to fairly simplify the analysis of entanglement.\nValidity of this condition (10) for completely entangled\nqubit-states in quite general settings has been checked in\nRef. [18]. Because the condition (10) deals directly with\nmeasurement of physical observables, it has been proposed in Ref. [18] to use the condition as an operational\ndefinition of complete entanglement.\n\ns\n\nIII.\n\nENTANGLEMENT IN A SINGLE\nSPIN-QUTRIT SYSTEM\n\nNote that the definition of complete entanglement (7)\nand its equivalent form (10) do not assume the multipartite character of quantum systems.\nDoes the single qubit obey the condition (10)? The\nanswer is not. The point is that the pure single-qubit\nstate\n\u03c8 = a| \u2191i + b| \u2193i,\n\n|a|2 + |b|2 = 1\n\nis in fact characterized by only two real parameters (|a|\nand arg a \u2212 arg b), for which three Eqs. (10) with Pauli\nmatrices as basic observables have only trivial solution.\nFor decades, qubits remain the main object of quantum information. Therefore, nonexistence of single-qubit\nentanglement is frequently used as a general argument\nagainst the single-particle entanglement (see nice discussion in Ref. [8]).\nWe now turn to the qutrit (1), which is specified by\nfive real parameters. Equations (10) with eight basic observables (2) clearly have only trivial solutions, so that\nsingle true qutrit system does not manifest entanglement\nlike single qubit system.\nSituation changes qualitatively if qutrit (1) is considered as a state of spin-qutrit system with only three basic observables (3) [10]. In this case, equations (10) with\nthree spin-1 operators (3) have nontrivial solutions, so\nthat complete entanglement of a single spin qutrit system\nis allowed. In particular, it is straightforward to calculate\nthe measure (11) for the single spin-qutrit state:\n\u03bc(\u03c8) = 2|\u03c8\u22121 \u03c81 \u2212 \u03c802 /2|.\n\n(12)\n\nThus, the state (1) of a single spin-1 system manifests\nentanglement if its coefficients obey the condition\n\n\f5\n\n1\n1\n\u2265 |\u03c8\u22121 |2 |\u03c81 |2 + |\u03c80 |2 \u2212 |\u03c8\u22121 ||\u03c80 ||\u03c81 |2 cos(\u03c6\u22121 + \u03c61 \u2212 2\u03c60 ) > 0.\n4\n4\n\nHere \u03c6l = arg \u03c8l . Complete entanglement is achieved\nwhen this form (13) takes the value 1/4. For example,\nthe states\n|\u03c80 i = |0i\n\n(14)\n\n1\n|\u03c8\u00b1 i = \u221a (|1i \u00b1 | \u2212 1i)\n2\n\n(15)\n\nand\n\nare completely entangled qutrit states of a single spinqutrit system.\nBefore we begin to discuss the precise meaning of the\nabove obtained result, let us stress the relativity of entanglement with respect to dynamic symmetry of physical system. The same state (1) is unentangled if dynamic\nsymmetry of the system is G = SU(3) and entangled in\nthe case of reduced dynamic symmetry G\u2032 = SU(2).\nTo interpret entanglement of single spin-qutrit system,\nlet us compare it with two-qubit entanglement that has\nbeen scrutinized thoroughly.\nIt is known that an entangled two-qubit state is associated with the SU(2) squeezed states [31], while unentangled states are the SU(2) coherent states [11, 12].\nWe now show that this interpretation is valid for the entangled and unentangled states of a single spin-qutrit as\nwell.\nLet us begin with the SU(2) coherent states that, for\na spin s, are defined in the following way [29, 30]\n|\u03b1i = D(\u03b1)| \u2212 si,\n\n\u03b1 \u2208 C,\n\nD\u03b1 = exp(\u03b1S+ \u2212 \u03b1\u2217 S\u2212 )\n\nIn the \"vacuum\" state | \u2212 si, the spin has a given projection \u2212s onto the z-axis h\u2212s|Sz | \u2212 si = \u2212s, so that\nthe corresponding variance V (Sz ; \u2212s) = 0. For the two\nother spin operators in the direction orthogonal to the\nquantization axis z we get\nh\u2212s|Sx | \u2212 si = h\u2212s|Sy | \u2212 si = 0,\nV (Sx ; \u2212s) = V (Sy ; \u2212s) = s/2,\nso that the total variance (6) takes the from\nV(\u2212s) = s.\nThis is the minimal value of the total variance for the\nspin-s system under consideration. Thus, in view of the\ndefinition of entanglement, given in the previous Section,\nthe state | \u2212 si is unentangled.\n\nAccording to Eq. (9), the maximum of the total variance of a single spin-s system is\nVmax = V(\u03c8CE ) = s(s + 1).\nThis allows us to represent the measure of entanglement\n(11) for a single spin-s system in the following form\n\n\u03bc(\u03c8) =\n(17)\n\nand | \u2212 si is the lowest state among the (2s + 1) states\nof spin-s system. Here\nS\u00b1 = Sx \u00b1 iSy\n\n|\u03b1i =\n\nare the spin rising and lowering operators, respectively.\n\n(16)\n\nwhere\n\n1p\nV(\u03c8) \u2212 s.\ns\n\n(18)\n\nThus, the measure (11) vanishes for coherent states.\nIt is easily seen that, in the case of a single qubit (s =\n1/2), any state of the system is a coherent one. While\nin the case of single spin-qutrit (s = 1), coherent states\n(16) have the form\n\n1\nei\u03c6\ne2i\u03c6\n[1 \u2212 cos(2|\u03b1|)]| + 1i + \u221a sin(2|\u03b1|)|0i + [1 + cos(2|\u03b1|)]| \u2212 1i,\n2\n2\n2\n\nwhere \u03c6 = arg \u03b1. Substituting coefficients of the state\n(19) into Eq. (12), we can see that the measure of entanglement vanishes like in the case of state | \u2212 1i. This is\n\n(13)\n\n(19)\n\nnatural. The point is that the operator (\u03b1S+ \u2212 \u03b1\u2217 S\u2212 ) in\n(17) belongs to the su(2) algebra, so that the displacement operator (17) amounts to an SU(2) rotation. This\n\n\f6\nmeans that every spin coherent state (16) is just a state\nwith minimal spin projection \u2212s onto some direction,\nwhich can be chosen as a new quantization axis. Thus,\nthere is no principle difference between the spin coherent\nstate and state | \u2212 si. In particular, spin coherent state\nis as unentangled as the state | \u2212 si.\nConsider now the spin squeezed state for the spinqutrit system under consideration.\nFollowing Kitagawa and Ueda [37], we call spin state\n\u03be to be squeezed iff Vr (\u03be) < s/2 for some direction r \u22a5 ~s,\nwhere\n~s = ~ex hSx i + ~ey hSy i + ~ez hSz i\nis the direction of the average spin vector.\nThis means that in a coordinate system with the z-axis\nalong the average spin vector ~s, we always have\nVx (\u03be) + Vy (\u03be) \u2265 s\n\n(20)\n\nin contrast to the spin-coherent state. It is easy to check\nthat this condition of squeezing (20) is valid for the states\n(14) and (15), therefore they are squeezed.\nSome spin-squeezed states can be constructed by\nmeans of the squeezing operator [37]\n2\n2\nS(\u03be) = exp[(\u03be \u2217 S\u2212\n\u2212 \u03beS+\n)/2],\n\nThus, this state is entangled if |\u03be| 6= k\u03c0/2, k = 0, 1, * * * .\nAt \u03be = \u03c0/4 + k\u03c0, this state coincides with (15) and hence\nmanifests complete entanglement.\nNote that in the case of a single qubit, the squeezing\noperator is simply the identity operator. The squeezed\nstates of two qubits are usually associated with a sort of\n\"two-mode\" squeezing [31].\nThus, for the single spin-qutrit system, coherent states\nare unentangled while squeezed states manifest entanglement like in the case of conventional two-qubit states.\nStress that this correspondence stays within the framework of the definition of entanglement based on Eqs. (7)\nand (8).\nAt the very beginning of the paper, we have stated\nthat the single-particle entanglement is caused by quantum correlations between intrinsic degrees of freedom of\nthe particle. The general picture of those correlations\ncan be revealed through the use of well known formal\ncorrespondence between the states of single spin-qutrit\nand two qubits, in other words, of two spin-1/2 and single spin-1. This correspondence is given by the ClebschGordon decomposition:\n\nH2 \u2297 H2 = H3 \u2295 HA ,\n(21)\nHere H2 denotes the two-dimensional Hilbert space of\nstates of a single spin- 21 , H3 is the three-dimensional\nHilbert space of spin-1, corresponding to the symmetric triplet of states in the basis of H2 \u2297 H2 , while HA\ncorresponds to the antisymmetric singlet in the basis of\nH2 \u2297 H2 . Denoting the basis in H2 by | \u2191i and | \u2193i, we\nobtain the basis in H3 in the following form\n\nso that\n|\u03bei = S(\u03be) | \u2212 1i = \u2212ei\u03c6 sin |\u03be| |1i + cos |\u03be| | \u2212 1i.\nHere \u03c6 = arg \u03be. The measure (11) for this state is\n\u03bc(\u03be) = | sin(2|\u03be|)|.\n\n\uf8f1\nprojection of total spin s = 1\n\uf8f2 | \u2191\u2191i,\n\u221a1 (| \u2191\u2193i+ \u2193\u2191i), projection of total spin s = 0\n|si =\n\uf8f3 2\n| \u2193\u2193i,\nprojection of total spin s = \u22121\nwhile the antisymmetric singlet is\n1\n|Ai = \u221a (| \u2191\u2193i \u2212 | \u2193\u2191i).\n2\n\n(23)\n\nIf we now assume that the singlet state (23) is forbidden because of some physical reasons, then the system of\ntwo qubits becomes exactly equivalent to the spin-qutrit\nsystem. Note, that one of the symmetric states in (22) is\ncompletely entangled in the two-qubit sector. This state\nis clearly equivalent to the state (14), which is completely\nentangled in the spin-qutrit sector as well. On making\nthe further assumption that spin-qutrit is a local object\n(particle), we have to associate the two qubits with intrinsic degrees of freedom of this object. Simply there is\nno alternative.\n\n(22)\n\nThus, the single spin-qutrit entanglement can be interpreted in terms of quantum correlations between the two\nintrinsic qubits under the following conditions:\n1. The Hilbert space of two qubits does not contain antisymmetric states.\n2. System of two qubits is a local one, so that we can\nneglect the spatial separation of the qubits and thus interpret them as intrinsic degrees of freedom of a single\n\"particle\".\n\nIn the next Section, we turn to the discussion of possible physical realizations of spin-qutrit entanglement.\n\n\f7\natom and two cavity modes, has the form\nHint = g1 R0+ a1 + g2 R0\u2212 a2 + H.c.,\n\n(24)\n\nwhere gi denotes the corresponding coupling constant,\nRbc = |bihc| is the atomic operator, and ai is the photon\nannihilation operator for the field mode i = 1, 2. The\nspin operators (3) have the form\n\nFIG. 1: Interaction between \u03bb-type three-level atom and two\ncavity modes.\n\nIV.\n\nPHYSICAL REALIZATIONS OF SINGLE\nSPIN-QUTRIT ENTANGLEMENT\n\nQubit systems are often associated with two-level\natoms, where quantum correlations between the atoms\ncan be generated either by photon exchange or by means\nof dipole-dipole interaction. In the latter case, decrease\nof the interatomic distance down to the lamb-Dicke limit\n(interatomic separation becomes much shorter than the\nwavelength of two-level transition) leads to an effective\ndiscard of the antisymmetric state [38]. Thus, this twoqubit system behaves like a single spin-qutrit object.\nThe nice feature of this example is that the reduction\nof symmetry\n[SU(2) \u00d7 SU(2)](in 4 dimensions) \u2192 SU(2)(in 3 dimensions)\nand localization accompany each other.\nAnother example is provided by the so-called biphoton, i.e. by two photons created at once and propagating\nalong the same direction (see [39] and references therein).\nWith respect to polarization, this object represents the\nSU(2) ternary system (spin-qutrit) and is as local as a\nsingle photon. Antisymmetric state with respect to permutations is forbidden here by the Bosonic nature of photons. Undoubtedly, biphoton can be split into spatially\nseparated photons, carrying polarization qubits. But before splitting, it should be considered as a local spinqutrit object.\nApologists of the standpoint that entanglement is inherent to systems with spatially separated parties can say\nthat the above two examples do not fit the notion of a\nsingle particle. Therefore, we now turn to examples that\ndefinitely correspond to a single particle entanglement.\nAn important example of the SU(2) ternary system is\nprovided by the three-level atom with \u03bb-type transition\nshown in Fig. 1.\nHere the highest excited level can be associated with\nthe state |0i of \"spin\" 1, while the two lower levels with\nthe states | + 1i and | \u2212 1i, respectively.\nThe Hamiltonian, describing interaction between the\n\n1\nSx = \u221a (R+0 + R0+ + R0\u2212 + R\u22120 ),\n2\n1\u2212i\nSy = \u221a (R+0 + \u2212R0+ + R0\u2212 \u2212 R\u22120 ),\n2\nSz = R++ \u2212 R\u2212\u2212 .\n\n(25)\n\nIn view of the results of Sec. III, the state |\u03c8in i =\n|0i \u2297 |vaci of the atom-field system, in which the atom is\nin excited state and cavity field is in the vacuum state, is\ncompletely entangled with respect to the atomic observables given by Eq. (25). Under influence of the atomphoton interaction (24), this state passes to the following\nnormalized state\n1\np\n(g1 |+i \u2297 |11 i + g2 |\u2212i \u2297 |12 i)\ng12 + g22\n\n(26)\n\nand vice versa. This state (26) can be interpreted as\nthe two-qubit state, where one qubit is formed by the\natomic states |\u00b1i and the second qubit by the photon\nstates |11 i and |12 i. Clearly, this state is entangled, and\nthe corresponding concurrence [36] has the form\n\u03bc=\n\n2|g1 g2 |\n.\ng12 + g22\n\nThis example clearly illustrates decay of the single\nspin-qutrit entangled state |\u03c8in i into the two-qubit entanglement. The atom and photon qubits can be spatially separated by cavity leakage.\nAnother important example of the SU(2) entanglement\nof single particle is provided by the isotriplet of \u03c0-mesons.\nFor detailed discussion of this example we refer recent\nwork [1].\nThe above example of meson isotriplet is similar to\nthe Cooper pairs in superfluid phases of 3 He. It is well\nknown that the atoms of 3 He have spin s = 12 each and\nthat the total spin of a Cooper pair is s = 1, so that the\nantisymmetric state of two atomic qubits is forbidden\n[40]. Note that in the BCS superconductors where s =\n0, the only allowed pair wave function is given by the\nantisymmetric singlet state (23).\nAnother simple example of a single particle with spin\n1, which can manifest entanglement, is provided by the\ndeuteron, which is a nucleus of a deuterium atom, consisting of weakly bounded proton and neutron [41]. Note\nthat, unlike \u03c0 0 meson, this is a stable particle. Each nucleon in the deuteron can be considered as an intrinsic\nqubit with respect to its spin 12 . An experimental proof\nof the existence of entanglement in deuteron and of the\n\n\f8\npossible use of it for quantum teleportation of spin states\nof massive particles has been reported recently Ref. [42].\nIt is possible to find many other examples, from the\nspin-1 atoms like 87 Rb and 23 Na, widely used in investigation of Bose-Einstein condensation, to the more exotic\nsystems like vector mesons and three spin-1 gauge bosons\nin the standard model [43], in which spin-qutrit entanglement may be realized.\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe have argued existence of single spin-qutrit entanglement. The instructive significance of this system is\nthat it allows twofold consideration as a single spin-1 object and as two qubits, defined in the symmetric sector\nof the Hilbert space. This correspondence allows us to\ninterpret entanglement of single spin-qutrit as manifestation of quantum correlations between the intrinsic qubit\ndegrees of freedom. We have shown that entanglement\nof single spin-qutrit particle may take place independent\nof whether or not the intrinsic qubits can be separated.\nThus, the single spin-qutrit entanglement does not fit\nconventional requirements of nonseparability and nonlocality. At the same time, the single spin-qutrit entanglement has all physical features of two-qubit entanglement.\nIn particular, entangled states of a single spin-qutrit are\nsqueezed and unentangled states are coherent like in the\ncase of bipartite systems.\nWe have discussed a number of physical objects that\ncan be prepared in entangled spin-qutrit states. We have\nshown that the physical condition of complete entanglement as extreme of quantum fluctuations can be important for understanding of low stability of entangled states\nof particles.\nThe obtained result about the single-particle entanglement for the spin-qubit system is clearly valid for all\nsystems with high enough dynamic symmetry SU(N ) at\nN \u2265 3.\nThe obtained results show distinctly that the physical\ndefinition of entanglement [1] based on definition of basic\nobservables and their quantum fluctuations, is more general than the previous definitions that appeal to nonlocality and nonseparability. As we have shown, using true\nand spin qutrits as an illustrative example, the presetting\nof basic observables plays crucial role in the description\nof entanglement. In particular, it defines specific relativity of entanglement with respect to dynamic symmetry of physical system. The definition in terms of the\nvariational principle (7) can be used for investigation of\nentanglement of different physical objects, including elementary particle, quasi-particle excitations in condensed\nmatter and so on. Thus, it essentially broaden the applicability of this notion beyond the bounds of quantum\ninformation. It is possible to say that the association\nof entanglement with quantum uncertainties of basic observables makes this notion to be ubiquitous in physics.\nThe possibility of experimental observation of single-\n\nparticle entangled states represents a problem of high\nimportance and deserves special discussion. Let us only\nnote that the decay of a single entangled SU(2) qutrit\ninto two entangled qubits may be used for this aim.\nIn our analysis, we have used a general approach to\nquantum entanglement [1], which assigns the primary importance to the dynamic symmetry properties of physical\nsystems.\nWe have restricted our consideration by pure states.\nIn the future, we hope to extend our approach on the\nmixed states. In particular case of single SU(2) qutrit,\nthe mixed state entanglement can be quantified in the\nsame way as the two-qubit entanglement (see Appendix\nC). So far, the measure of mixed-state entanglement is\nknown only for two qubits (see the first reference in [36]).\nThe principle difficulty here is that the total variance of\nmixed states contains contributions of both quantum and\nclassical (statistical) uncertainties. The problem of detachment of the two principally different contributions\ndeserves special discussion. The ideas related to the\nWigner-Yanase quantum information [33, 34] may be useful here.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nPart of this work was carried out (by M.A.C.) at the\nJet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).

It is known that the measurement of\na quantum mechanical observable Xi in a given state \u03c8\nproduces random quantity xi determined by expectations\nh\u03c8|f (Xi )|\u03c8i of all functions f (xi ) (it is usually enough to\nconsider only moments f (xi ) = xni (see Ref. [44]). In the\ncase of commuting quantum observables [Xi , Xj ] = 0, the\ncorresponding random quantities xi and xj have the same\njoint probability distribution. Einstein's idea of classical\nrealism [4] assumes that all quantum observables have the\nsame hidden joint distribution independent of whether\nthey are commuting or not.\nBell's approach to prove nonexistence of hidden variables is based on formulation of certain \"classical\" conditions on measurement of quantum observables and check\nof their violation in quantum mechanics [6]. Note that,\nfrom the mathematical point of view, problem of Bell's\nconditions lies within the problem of distributions with\ngiven margins [11, 13] and that practically all known and\nmany still unknown Bell-type inequalities were obtained\nin mathematics even before the formulation of problem\nby Bell.\n\n\f9\nIt has been proved in Ref. [11] that an irreducible\nquantum system with dynamic symmetry group G of\nrank rk(G) \u2265 2 is incompatible with classical realism, i.e.\nviolates Bell-type conditions. Since rk(SU(n)) = n \u2212 1,\nstate of a single true qutrit with the dynamic symmetry group G = SU(3) violate Bell's conditions of classical\nrealism. It has been shown in Section III that the true\nqutrit states do not manifest entanglement.\n\nlations of all three qubits and entanglement due to correlation between pair of parts [17]. The three-qubit entanglement is measured by means of 3-tangle [17, 45], which\nfor the general state\n\n|\u03c8i =\nAppendix B: Three-qubit entanglement\n\nThree-qubit states may manifest entanglement of two\ndifferent types.

The non-separable\nstates from the GHZ class manifest only three-partite\nentanglement (3-tangle (27) has nonzero values for the\nstates from this class), while any pair of qubits is unentangled. The latter can be checked by reduction of\nthe three-qubit density matrix \u03c1GHZ = |GHZihGHZ| to\nthe two-qubit mixed state \u03c1\u2032 GHZ = Trsingle \u03c1GHZ , where\nTrsingle denotes trace over one of the parts, with the subsequent calculation of the concurrence, which in this case\nalways have zero value.\nIn turn, the non-separable states from the W class always have zero 3-tangle and hence do not manifest threepartite entanglement. In turn, any bipartite reduced\nstate with the density matrix \u03c1\u2032 W = Tr(|W ihW |) has\nnonzero concurrence and therefore shows bipartite entanglement.\nFinally, the separable states from the Bi class are similar, in a sense, to the W states. Namely, they always\nhave zero 3-tangle while manifest bipartite entanglement\n(for two given qubits only).\nThus, the nonseparability (separability) of the threequbit states does not indicate identically the presence\n(absence) of entanglement and its type in contrast to the\nbipartite systems.\n\nIn the latter case, entanglement is usually associated\nwith specific behavior of entropy of the reduced state\nsingle-part state. Namely, entanglement of two qubits\nwith statistical state \u03c1AB exists if H(\u03c1A ) = H(\u03c1B ) 6= 0,\nwhere H(\u03c1) = \u2212Tr(\u03c1 log \u03c1) is the von Neumann entropy.\nThe maximal (complete) entanglement corresponds to\nthe reduced states that have the diagonal form\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1/2 0\n, r = A, B,\n\u03c1r =\n0 1/2\nin a certain basis of the two-dimensional single-qubits\nspace [46].\nIn the above case of three-qubits, these conditions do\nnot work. Consider as an example the GHZ-type state\nof the form |\u03a8i = x|000i + y|111i, x2 + y 2 = 1. It is\nseen that 3-tangle (27) \u03c4 (\u03a8) = 4x2 y 2 = 4x2 (1 \u2212 x2 ), so\nthat the state is entangled (in the three-part sector) for\nall x \u2208 (0, 1). The reduced two-qubit density matrix for\nany pair of qubits has the form\n\u03c1R = x2 |00ih00| + (1 \u2212 x2 )|11ih11|\nwith the corresponding von Neumann entropy\nH(\u03c1R ) = \u2212x2 log x2 \u2212 (1 \u2212 x2 log(1 \u2212 x2 ).\nSubsequent reduction of \u03c1R to the single-qubit state\n\u03c1RR = x2 |0ih0| + (1 \u2212 x2 )|1ih1|\nobviously leads to the same von Neumann entropy H(\u03c1R )\nas \u03c1R , although there is no two-qubit entanglement in the\nstate. Similar behavior, showing unfitness of the reduced\nstate entropy as a general measure of entanglement, is\nmanifested by the W and Bi states of three qubits as\nwell.\n\n\f10\nAppendix C: Mixed state entanglement\n\nAmount of entanglement carried by a mixed single spin\nqutrit state can be calculated in the same way as for\ntwo qubits through the use of Wootters' concurrence [36].\nNamely\n\u03bc(\u03c1) = max(0, \u03bb1 \u2212 \u03bb2 \u2212 \u03bb3 ),\n\n(31)\n\nSl \u03c8 = i[l, \u03c8].\nSpin projection has one real eigenstate |0i = l with\neigenvalue 0 and two imaginary eigenstates | \u00b1 1i =\n\u221a1 (m \u00b1 in) with eigenvalues \u00b11, where (l, m, n) is or2\nthonormal basis of R3 (e.g. coordinate vectors i, j, k).\n\nwhere \u03bbi are the square roots of the eigenvalues of the\n(3 \u00d7 3) matrix \u03c1F \u03c1\u2217 F , in decreasing order. Here the\n\"spin-flip\" transformation matrix F is defined for the\nspin qutrit state as follows\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n0 0 \u22121\nF =\uf8ed0 1 0 \uf8f8\n\u22121 0 0\n\nIt corresponds to the Wootters' spin-flip transformation\n\u03c3y \u2297 \u03c3y defined in the symmetric sector of the fourdimensional Hilbert space.\nFor example, the concurrence (31) of the \"symmetric\"\nWerner state\nx\n\u03c1W = (| + 1ih+1| + |0ih0| + | \u2212 1ih\u22121|) + (1 \u2212 x)|0ih0|,\n3\nwhich represents superposition of completely mixed and\ncompletely entangled states, has the form\n\u001a\n(1 \u2212 4x/3), at 0 \u2264 x < 3/4\nC(\u03c1W ) =\n0,\nat 3/4 \u2264 x \u2264 1\nRemind that in the case of conventional two-qubit\nWerner state [47] the concurrence has the form\n\u001a\n(1 \u2212 3x/2), at 0 \u2264 x < 2/3\nC(\u03c1W4d ) =\n0,\nat 2/3 \u2264 x \u2264 1\nThus, entanglement of \"symmetric\" Werner state survives at higher admixture of completely chaotic state\nthan that of Werner state in the whole space H2 \u2297 H2 .\nAppendix D: Violation of Bell-type condition by\nsingle spin 1\n\nSpin 1 state space can be represented with complexification of Euclidian space of H = R3 \u2297 C where SU (2) \u223c\nSO(3) acts on H by rotations R3 .

While Sl has three\neigenvalues, Rl has only two eigenvalues \u00b11. Observe\nthat Rl2 = 1 and operators Rl and Rm commute iff l \u22a5\nm. Then they have joint probability distribution, and\nare simultaneously measurable observables.\nConsider a cyclic quintuplet of unit vectors li \u2208 R3 ,\ni mod 5, such that li \u22a5 li+1 , and call it pentagram.\nPut Ri := Rli . Then [Ri , Ri+1 ] = 0 and for all possible\neigenvalues ri = \u00b11 of observable Ri\n(r1 r2 )(r2 r3 )(r3 r4 )(r4 r5 )(r5 r1 ) = 1.\nAmong those five monomials at least one is positive. So\nthe following inequality holds\nr1 r2 + r2 r3 + r3 r4 + r4 r5 + r5 r1 + 3 \u2265 0.\n\nIff all Ri would have a joint distribution then taking\naverage of (32) one get Bell's type inequality\n\nh\u03c8|R1 R2 |\u03c8i + h\u03c8|R2 R3 |\u03c8i + h\u03c8|R3 R4 |\u03c8i + h\u03c8|R4 R5 |\u03c8i + h\u03c8|R5 R1 |\u03c8i + 3 \u2265 0\nfor testing classical realism.\n\n(32)\n\n(33)\n\nUsing the identity Ri = 1 \u2212 2|li ihli | one can recast it\n\n\f11\ninto geometrical form\nX\nX\n|hli , \u03c8i|2 \u2264 2 \u21d0\u21d2\ncos2 \u03b1i \u2264 2,\ni mod 5\n\ni mod 5\n\n\u03b1i = lc\ni \u03c8.\n\nIt turns out that every non-coherent spin state violates\ninequality (34) for an appropriate pentagram, and the\ncoherent states pass this test for any pentagram, see the\nRef.
