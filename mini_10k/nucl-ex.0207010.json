Precise determinations of resonance properties (masses, widths, and electromagnetic couplings) provide vital benchmarks for the development of quark models. Much of our present knowledge\nhas been obtained through pion-nucleon scattering. The existence of many\nresonances has been established and some properties have been determined\nwith reasonable precision [1]. However, many features of the baryon spectrum remain a mystery. Among 43 nucleon and delta resonances predicted by\nQCD-inspired models [2], only 24 have been well established (\"four-star\" or\n\"three-star\" resonances [1]). The remaining (existing) resonances are either\nmasked by overlapping states or are weakly excited in reactions coupled to\nthe single-pion\u2212nucleon channel.\nMeson photoproduction offers a complementary approach to the baryon spectroscopy. The photoproduction of mesons other than pions allows access to\nstates which could be suppressed in the pion-nucleon scattering. Here, and\nalso in the case of pion photoproduction, the beam asymmetry observable \u03a3\nhas proven to be particularly sensitive to resonance properties [3].\nProperties of resonances are extracted from the photoproduction data by\nmeans of partial wave analysis and multipole decomposition in the framework of different approaches [4,5]. The comparison of calculated observables\nto experimental data constrains theoretical models [6,7] and determines the\nrole and properties of the included resonances. The quality of this procedure\nis directly related to the quality of the data base. The extraction of resonance\n1\n2\n\nContact person: E-mail Slava@cpc.inr.ac.ru, Slava@gravax2.in2p3.fr\nContact person: E-mail Ron@alpha1.phys.gwu.edu\n\n2\n\n\fparameters clearly requires both the unpolarized cross section and polarization observables [8,9]. While the cross section is a source of information on\ndominating components of the scattering amplitude, the polarization observables, in particular the polarized-photon beam-asymmetry \u03a3, are much more\nsensitive to the non-dominant contributions.\nThe high yield and kinematic simplicity of single-pion photoproduction offers\nan opportunity to produce high precision experimental data. Several recent\nattempts have been made to study the nucleon and Delta resonances using\nsingle-pion photoproduction data, from which parameters of the dominant\nresonances have been extracted [4,5,7]. Uncertainties for other resonances remain large, due both to the quality of available data and model-dependence\ninherent in the extraction process.\nThe world data base is rather extensive, containing 20,000 data points for a\nsingle-pion photoproduction [4] below 2 GeV. However, this count includes\nmany old unpolarized cross sections measured with bremsstrahlung beams in\nthe first and second resonance regions. There is a clear lack of polarized data\nabove 1 GeV. Only a few tens of beam asymmetry points, of low accuracy\nand dated before 1980, are available for the \u03c0 + n final state. In this Letter,\nwe report a new measurement of the beam asymmetry \u03a3 for positive-pion\nphotoproduction on the proton over the energy range of 0.8\u22121.5 GeV. We\nshall see that, by adding a significant number of precise points to the data\nbase, an important constraint is placed on the existing partial wave analyses.\nThe present data have been obtained at the GRAAL facility. The polarized and\ntagged photon beam is produced by backscattering of laser light on 6.04 GeV\nelectrons which circulate in the storage ring of the ESRF (Grenoble, France).\nThrough the use of green 514 nm laser light, the tagged spectrum covers\nan energy range of 0.55\u22121.1 GeV. Alternately, the UV 351 nm line can be\nemployed, resulting in an energy range of 0.8\u22121.5 GeV. The linear beam polarization varies from \u223c0.45 at the lower energy limits to 0.98 at the upper\nlimits. The detection system includes three main parts:\n- At forward angles \u03b8lab \u2264 25\u25e6 there are two planar wire chambers, a thin\ntime-of-flight (TOF) hodoscope made up of 26 horizontal and 26 vertical plastic scintillator strips, each 3 cm thick, and a TOF shower wall [10]. The latter\nis an assembly of 16 modules, each being a sandwich of four converter-plusscintillator layers.\n- At central angles from 25 to 155\u25e6 , the target is surrounded by two cylindrical\nwire chambers, a 5 mm thick scintillator \u2206E barrel, and a BGO ball made up\nof 480 crystals, each of 21 radiation lengths [11].\n- At backward angles \u03b8lab \u2265 155\u25e6 there are two plastic scintillator disks separated by a 1 cm lead converter.\nThe apparatus provides the detection and identification of all types of final\nstate particles in an almost 4\u03c0 solid angle and has cylindrical symmetry, mak3\n\n\f10 3\n\n10 2\n\n10\n\n1\n160\n\n165\n\n170\n\n175\n\n180\n\n185\n\n190\n\n195 200\n\u2206\u03c6, deg\n\nFig. 1.

Upper curve corresponds to the\nselection of one neutral and one charged hit in the detector; medium curve is after\nthe identification of a neutron and a pion; black area indicates finally selected events.\n\ning it suitable for measurements of the beam asymmetry \u03a3. The detailed\ndescription of the GRAAL facility and the procedure used in deriving \u03a3 from\nexperimental data may be found in [10\u201313].\nThe present measurement is a high energy extension of the previous one,\nperformed at GRAAL in the energy range of 0.6\u22121.1 GeV by using the green\nlaser line [13]. One important advantage of this measurement is the use of\nthe high resolution cylindrical chambers, in coincidence with the scintillator\nbarrel and BGO ball, to detect pions and to reconstruct their trajectories. As\na result, the determination of the scattering angle \u0398cm is made possible with\nan average accuracy of 2.5\u25e6 (FWHM). This feature allows a reduction in the\nwidths of angular bins and decreases systematic uncertainties related to the\ngranularity of the BGO ball. Furthermore, an improved background rejection\nis achieved by requesting this triple coincidence between the chambers, the\nbarrel, and the BGO ball.\nNeutrons at forward angles, corresponding to backward pions, were detected\nin the forward shower wall. Their discrimination from other types of particles\nis made possible by means of the anticoincidence of the wall with the preceding\nplanar chambers and scintillator hodoscope, and by using a \u2206E\u2212TOF relation\n[10]. Neutrons emitted at central angles above 25\u25e6 were detected in the BGO\nball. The wire chambers and the scintillator barrel surrounding the target allow\na discrimination between neutral and charged particles.

Black circles are the new\npoints, crosses are the results of the previous measurement [13].\n\nbetween photons and neutrons is possible, considering the number of BGO\ncrystals in the cluster which correspond to a neutral particle hit. As found\nin GEANT simulations, neutron clusters normally do not contain more than\n3 crystals. Photons, however, produce larger clusters of a size depending on\nthe deposited energy, and usually include 4\u221210 crystals. The identification\nof charged pions and their discrimination from protons is achieved by using\n\u2206E \u2212 E relations between the energy \u2206E deposited by a charged particle in\nthe thin scintillator barrel and the corresponding energy deposition E in the\nBGO ball.\nThe TOF resolution for neutrons in the shower wall is 700 ps (FWHM) [10].\nFor fast neutrons in the forward direction, this results in a poor energy resolution of about 30% depending on the neutron kinetic energy. The response\nof the BGO ball for both neutrons and pions is not uniquely related to the\nkinetic energy due to the complicated interaction of these particles in the detector volume [11]. By contrast, the angles of outgoing particles are measured\nwith good resolution: 3\u25e6 (FWHM) for pions, 2.5 \u2212 3\u25e6 (FWHM) for neutrons in\nthe forward direction and 6 \u2212 8\u25e6 (FWHM) for neutrons at central angles. For\nthis reason, only the angular quantities have been exploited for the identification of the \u03c0 + n final state. For those events which have generated two hits\nin the detection system, associated with a pion and a neutron, the correlation\nbetween the pion and neutron \u0398 angles and the coplanarity have been used\nto select the \u03c0 + n events. After this selection, the spectrum of the reaction\ncoplanarity (\u03c6n \u2212 \u03c6\u03c0 ) exhibited a narrow peak (Fig. 1) lying on the broad\n5\n\n\fbackground originating mostly from multipion production. The contribution\nof this background, which never exceeded 3%, was evaluated from the tails in\n(\u03c6n \u2212 \u03c6\u03c0 ) distributions and subtracted separately in each \u2206E\u2206\u0398\u2206\u03c6 bin, in\norder to account for the possible azimuthal anisotropy of this background.\nThe beam asymmetry \u03a3 was extracted from the azimuthal distribution of\nselected events for the linearly polarized beam, normalized to the azimuthal\ndistribution corresponding to an unpolarized beam, as it is described in details\nin [13]. This procedure reduces significantly systematic errors of the extracted\nasymmetries. The remaining systematic errors, estimated as not more than\n0.02, originate from the unsignificant uncertainties in the background subtraction and from the slight variations of the beam profile on the target. Another\nsource of the systematic uncertainty is the possible deterioration of the laser\nlight polarization on the mirrors, lenses and the window of the laser focusing\nsystem. This factor adds the relative error of 1%.\nThe present set of 237 \u03a3 beam asymmetries, measured over the energy and\nangular ranges of 800\u22121500 MeV and 40 \u2212 160\u25e6 , is an extension of a previous\nGRAAL data set consisting of 92 data points from 600 to 1050 MeV. The\ntwo sets of points are shown at overlapping energies in Fig. 2. The new data\nhave been measured using the UV laser, producing a different beam spectrum\nand a different polarization for each beam energy [12]. Some improvements in\nthe apparatus and the analysis procedure have also been implemented. Given\nthese differences, the reproducibility of our results is excellent and supports\nthe quality of both data sets.\nThe major part of our new results is shown in Fig. 3, along with results from\nthe most accurate older experiments [14\u201316]. In general, our values are in\nagreement with the previous measurements. However, above 950 MeV, we do\nnot confirm four points from [14] at 75\u25e6 . 136 data points were produced in\nan almost unexplored domain above 1050 MeV, where only 45 old points of\nlower accuracy were available. The new results also cover backward angles\nabove 120\u25e6, where no previous measurements exist. Due to improved angular\nresolution, these results have been obtained with narrow angular bins of 6\u221210\u25e6 ,\nwhich reveal a complicated angular variation in the \u03a3 asymmetry.\nWe have compared our results with the prediction of a unitary isobar model\nof Drechsel et al. [5]. This model, known as MAID2000, in addition to Born\nterms and vector meson exchange, includes all 3\u2212 and 4\u2212star resonances to a\nCM energy of 1800 MeV, apart from the P33 (1600) and D15 (1675). The latest\nversion of these calculations[17], which includes resonance parameters obtained\nfrom a fit to the restricted benchmark data base[18], in general reproduces our\ndata up to 1200 MeV, though in some regions discrepancies are still significant.\nIn order to assess the impact of our new data, we employed the partial wave\n6\n\n\f1\n0.5\n0\n-0.5\n1\n0.5\n0\n-0.5\n1\n0.5\n0\n-0.5\n1\n0.5\n0\n-0.5\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\nFig. 3. \u03a3 beam asymmetry at different energies. Black circles indicate our results\n(error bars are the quadratutes of the statistic and systematic errors); open circles\nindicate the results of the Daresbury group [14]; open triangles and squares indicate\nthe results from SLAC [15,16]. The solid and dashed lines indicate the FA01 and\nWI00 solutions of [4], respectively; the dotted line is the prediction of MAID2000\n[5]; the dashed line is MAID2000 after fitting the benchmark database [17].\n\nanalysis of the Data Analysis Center of The George Washington University\n(SAID) [4]. Two solutions of the SAID analysis are shown in Fig. 3: WI00,\nwhich was produced prior to this measurement, however using our previous\nresults [13], and FA01, a solution developed after adding our new polarized\ndata and cross section points [19] to the data base. At the lower energies\nbetween 900 and 1050 MeV, the WI00 solution is found to be in agreement\nwith the new data, although differing slightly at angles less than 70\u25e6 . At\nthe higher energies, differences become more apparent and only a qualitative\nagreement is available. The FA01 solution fits our data reasonably well, with\n\u03c72 / data of 555/237, compared to an overall \u03c72 /data \u223c 2 for the full data\nbase (in both WI00 and FA01).\nIn order to illustrate the effect of new data in the SAID analysis, we compare\n3\n1\n1\n2\n2\n2\np E0+ , p E0+ , and p E1+ multipoles of the WI00 and FA01 solutions. Partial cross\n7\n\n\fsection contributions from these multipoles are shown in Fig. 4:\n1\n2\np E0+ multipole. Two distinct peaks correspond to the S11 (1535) and S11 (1650)\nresonances. The possibility of a third S11 resonance, near 1750 MeV, has been\nconsidered in several recent studies [20,21,6]. The effect of this resonance was\nfound to be particularly significant in a study of eta photoproduction data\n[6]. In Fig. 3, this state would be hidden in the shoulder of the second S11\npeak of the FA01 solution. Another candidate has been suggested at higher\nenergy (the S11 (2090)). The \"one-star\" S11 (2090) included in Refs. [22,23] has\nan estimated mass nearer to 1900 MeV. A further indication for this state\nstems from the analysis of low-statistics \u03b7 \u2032 photoproduction data [23].\n1\n2\nDifferences appearing in the p E0+\nwave may be indications of such states,\nwhich have not been included in either of the displayed fits (WI00 and FA01).\nHowever, the signals are weak. New data at higher energies (\u03c0 0 data from\nGRAAL) are required before any conclusion is possible. These states, if they\nexist, can only be weakly coupled to \u03c0N (as is evident in the low cross section). Clearer results may come from other channels, such as \u03b7N, through\nstudies such as the one reported in Ref. [6]. Forthcoming GRAAL and CLAS\n\u03b7 photoproduction data are clearly of great importance to this issue.\n3\n2\np E0+ multipole. The peak existing in the WI00 solution corresponds to the\nS31 (1620) resonance. This structure nearly vanishes in the FA01 solutions.\n1\n2\n\nmultipole. An opposite trend is found in this multipole. Here a much\nmore pronounced structure, corresponding to the P13 (1720), is seen in the\nrevised fit.\np E1+\n\nAt present, the P13 (1720) and S31 (1620) resonances have poorly determined\nphoto-decay amplitudes. Neither state can be identified through the \"canonical\" resonance behavior of its associated multipoles. A similar problem is seen\nin the analysis of elastic pion-nucleon scattering data [20]. Both states have\nnearby pole-zero pairs in the complex energy plane. As a result, resonance\nproperties are difficult to determine.\nThe ambiguous situation surrounding the S31 (1620) has been pointed out\nin [24]. The Particle Data Group estimates the photo-decay coupling of the\n1\nS31 (1620) to be A 1 = (0.027 \u00b1 0.011) GeV\u2212 2 [1]. This value was obtained\n2\nas a weighted average of contradicting results from [4,25], which range from\n1\n(\u22120.026 \u00b1 0.008) to (0.126 \u00b1 0.021) GeV\u2212 2 . In a recent multi-channel fit [7]\nthis quantity was found to be near zero. Our results also suggest a small value.\nWe have studied the sensitivity of observables in the WI00 and FA01 solutions to the S31 (1620) resonance. For W=1620 MeV, we found an essential\ndifference (10-15%) between two solutions for the \u03a3, T, and P onservables\nin \u03c0 + n photoproduction, and \u03a3 observable in \u03c0 0 p photoproduction (\u03a3, T, P\ndenote beam, target, and recoil asymmetries respectively).

New polarized data from modern\nphoton factories are clearly needed to place more constraints on determination\nof properties of this and other resonances.\nWe are grateful to the staff of the contributing Institutes for their assistance\nin the development and maintenance of the apparatus.
