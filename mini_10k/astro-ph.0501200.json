Introduction\nDuring the past two decades, several closed cosmological models aiming the\nsingularity-free description of the universe have been proposed.1,2,3 In these works,\nthe universe was modeled as a closed Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker spacetime, bouncing from a Planck mass and radius state with inflation, connecting to\nthe standard model of radiation and then to the era of matter dominance. Although\nthey correctly described the evolution of the universe, these models could not predicted the present value of the Hubble parameter within the observed range. The\napproach developed by Bay\u0131n, Cooperstock and Faraoni3 was applied to open geometry by Karaca and Bay\u0131n4 and it was shown that a singularity-free cosmological\nmodel which complies with the recent measurements is possible for open geometry.\nIn this model, since the initially static condition (\u0227(0) = 0) used in the closed models can no longer be used in the open universe case, the universe starts with an\ninitial expansion rate, i.e., \u0227(0) 6= 0. Hence, this model is a two-parameter universe\nmodel in which one of the parameters determines the strength of the initial vacuum\ndominance and the other corresponds to the initial expansion rate.\nIt is well known that some theories require the existence of higher dimensions\nin the early stages of the universe. In this paper, we investigate the possibility that\nhigher dimensions might have existed during the inflationary prematter phase of the\nuniverse and explore its observable consequences. As in the previous papers1,2,3,4\nwe adopt the Gliner5 -Markov6 picture of Planck limits to the physical quantities.\n1\n\n\fNovember 16, 2018 3:13 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE\n\n2\n\npaper\n\nK. Karaca and S. Bay\u0131n\n\n2. Description of the Model\nIn our model, universe starts its journey as a D (D > 3) dimensional open Friedmann model (D denotes the number of initial space dimensions). At t = 0 density\nof the universe is taken as the Planck density. Existence of higher dimensions and\ntheir reduction to three dimensions are assumed to take place during the inflationary\nprematter phase where the equation of state is given as\nPD = (\u03b3D \u2212 1) \u03c1D .\n\n(1)\n\nHere, \u03b3D is assumed to be a positive, small and dimensionless constant that characterizes the prematter in D dimensions, and PD and \u03c1D represent the pressure and\nenergy density in D dimensions, respectively.\nDuring this phase the universe expands isentropically while its temperature increases. This expansion continues until the maximum allowed temperature, i.e., the\nPlanck temperature of that dimension (Tpl,D ) is reached. At this point, we postulate that a phase transition to a lower dimension takes place, where the Planck\ntemperature is higher. Hence, the universe finds more room for further inflation.\nThis process continues until we reach D = 3. At this point, either the last reduction\nmay carry the universe directly to the standard radiation era (P = 13 \u03c1) or prematter\nera may continue once more in the usual three-dimensional space and then comes\nthe radiation era. In either case, the universe is eventually carried to the era of\nmatter dominance (P = 0). In this work, we will consider the second alternative.\nNaturally, neither the dimensional reduction takes place at an instant nor we\ncould expect the universe to remain homogeneous and isotropic during dimensional\nreduction. However, we expect the duration of this process to be very short compared to the times that the universe spends in constant D eras where it is expanding as a D dimensional Friedmann model. Details of what happens during the\ndimensional reduction phase is beyond the scope of the present work. However, by\nimposing suitable boundary conditions at the transition points we could trace the\neffects of extra dimensions on the currently observable parameters of the universe,\ni.e., Hubble constant, age and density.\n3. Boundary Conditions and Solutions for the Scale Factor\nWe assume open, homogeneous and isotropic (1 + D) dimensional spacetimes where\nthe metric is given as:\nds2 = c2 dt2 \u2212 a2D (t)[d\u03c72 + sinh2 \u03c7d\u03b812 + sinh2 \u03c7 sin2 \u03b81 d\u03b822 + .....\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n..... + sinh \u03c7 sin \u03b81 sin \u03b82 ..... sin\n\n(2)\n\n2\n\u03b8D\u22122 d\u03b8D\u22121\n],\n\nwhere aD (t) represents the scale factor of the universe, t is the comoving time,\n0 \u2264 \u03b8n \u2264 \u03c0, 0 \u2264 \u03b8D\u22121 \u2264 2\u03c0, 0 \u2264 \u03c7 \u2264 \u221e and n = 1, 2, ........., D \u2212 2. We also assume\nthat the universe is filled with a perfect fluid which is represented by a stress-energy\ntensor having the following nonvanishing components:\nT00 = \u03c1D ,\n\nD\nT11 = T22 = ..... = TD\n= \u2212PD .\n\n(3)\n\n\fNovember 16, 2018 3:13 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE\n\npaper\n\nAn Open Inflationary Model for Dimensional Reduction\n\n3\n\nEinstein's gravitational field equations in (1 + D) dimensional space-time are (see,\ne.g., Ref. 7, pp. 470-482)\n\"\u0012\n#\n\u00132\n\u0227D\nD(D \u2212 1)\nAD GD\n(4)\n\u2212 1 = 2 4 \u03c1D ,\n2a2D\nc\ncD\n\"\u0012 \u0013\n#\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2\n\u00e4D\n\u0227D\n(D \u2212 1) (D \u2212 2)\nAD GD\n(1 \u2212 D) 2\n\u2212\n(5)\n\u2212 1 = 2 4 PD ,\ncD aD\n2a2D\ncD\ncD\nwhere the subscript D denotes the value of that quantity in D dimensions, AD is the\nsolid angle subtended by a sphere in a D dimensional space (A3 = 4\u03c0, A4 = 2\u03c0 2 ,\nA5 = 8\u03c0 2 /3,...) and a dot denotes differentiation with respect to the cosmic time\nt. We may combine Eqs. (1), (4) and (5) to obtain an equation involving only the\nscale factor a(t). Furthermore, if we introduce a new dependent variable given by\nR t dt\u2032\na\u2032\nD\nand define conformal time as \u03b7 = c a(t\n= dlna\nu D \u2261 aD\n\u2032 ) we get the Riccati\nd\u03b7\nD\nequation\nu\u2032D + cD u2D \u2212 cD = 0,\n\n(6)\n\nD\n2 \u03b3D\n\nwhere cD =\n\u2212 1 and a prime denotes differentiation with respect to \u03b7. In the\nfollowing, we will consider values of \u03b3D such that cD 6= 0. Eq.

At this point we\ntake the density of the universe equal to that of a massless scalar field with a thermal\nspectrum at Tpl,D , i.e.,\n\u03c1 (\u03b7D ) =\n\nAD\n\nD+1\n\nD\n\n(2\u03c0c~)\n\n\u0393 (D + 1) \u03be (D + 1) (kTpl,D )\n\n.\n\n(8)\n\nThen, it is possible to find the duration of the initial prematter era by making use\nof Eqs. (4) and (8).\nAccording to our consideration, dimensional reduction takes place via a first\norder phase transition. But, its duration could be taken negligibly small when compared with the durations of the constant D eras in the history of the universe. Thus,\ndimensional reduction could be considered to be taking place at an instant of time.\nDenoting this time as \u03b7D , we may write Eq. (4) in terms of conformal time \u03b7 just\nbefore the dimensional reduction at \u03b7 = \u03b7D \u2212 | \u01eb | as\n#\n\"\u0012 \u0013\n2\n2AD GD\n1\na\u2032D\nD(D \u2212 1)\n\u2212 2 =\n\u03c1D ,\n(9)\n2\n2\naD\naD\nc4\n\n\fNovember 16, 2018 3:13 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE\n\n4\n\npaper\n\nK. Karaca and S. Bay\u0131n\n\nwhere \u01eb is a small number. After the dimensional reduction at \u03b7D , the number of\nspace dimensions becomes (D \u2212 1) and Eq. (9) takes the following form\n\"\u0012\n#\n\u00132\na\u2032D\u22121\n2AD\u22121 GD\u22121\n(D \u2212 1)(D \u2212 2)\n1\n=\n\u03c1D\u22121 ,\n(10)\n\u2212 2\n2\na2D\u22121\naD\u22121\nc4\nat \u03b7 = \u03b7D + | \u01eb | . In Eqs. (9) and (10), GD and GD\u22121 denote the gravitational\nconstant in D and D \u2212 1 dimensions, respectively. At this point, as the most natural\nand simple boundary conditions we take aD (\u03b7) and a\u2032D (\u03b7) as continuous physical\nquantities at the transition points. Of course, strictly speaking neither of them could\nbe continuous. However, since the phase transitions take place in a time interval\nwhose duration is expected to be significantly smaller than those of the constant\nD eras and the evolution of the universe during these eras is inflationary, we could\nargue that during the transition period the change in aD (\u03b7) is negligible. On the\nother hand, in the limit as \u01eb \u2192 0 a discontinuity in a\u2032D (\u03b7) would imply infinite forces\nacting on the universe, which in turn implies infinite values for the combinations\nGD \u03c1D and GD PD during the dimensional reduction. Thus, for the time being we\nargue that taking a\u2032D (\u03b7) as continuous at the transition points is a good working\nassumption. We now consider Eqs. (9) and (10) in the limit as \u01eb \u2192 0 and take their\nratios to obtain\n\u0014\n\u0015\nD AD\u22121 \u03c1D\u22121\nGD\n=\n.\n(11)\nGD\u22121\nD \u2212 2 AD\n\u03c1D \u03b7=\u03b7D\nWith the help of Eq. (11) we relate the change in GD to that in \u03c1D . Thus, in\norder to find how GD changes as D changes, we have to know the discontinuity\nin density when the universe experiences a dimensional reduction. We may express\nthis discontinuity by defining\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u03c1D\u22121\nlD,D\u22121 =\n,\n(12)\n\u03c1D \u03b7=\u03b7D\nwhich gives us a critical length parameter with [lD,D\u22121 ] = cm. Now, we could write\nthe following expression for the change in GD :\nGD\nD AD\u22121\n=\nlD,D\u22121 ,\nGD\u22121\nD \u2212 2 AD\n\n(13)\n\nwhere lD,D\u22121 defines a characteristic length scale which marks the point at which\ndimensional reduction occurs.\n4. Numerical Results and Conclusion\nIn order to demonstrate the basic features of our model we now consider a numerical\nmodel which starts from a D = 4 prematter era and evolves into a D = 3 prematter.\nIn this model, to produce numerical results for the cosmological parameters of the\nuniverse one has to assign numerical values to the characteristic parameters of the\nmodel, i.e., c3 , c4 , l4,3 and the initial value of the Hubble constant H(0).

In determining the\ncritical parameters of the model we first consider the present value of the density:\n\u0013 2(2\u2212c3 )\n\u0012\n4l4,3 3(2c3 \u22121)\n\u221235\ngr/cm3 ,\n(14)\n\u03c1(\u03b7now ) = 6.2269 * 10 Tm\n\u03c0lpl\nwhere Tm , which stands for the recombination temperature, is roughly at the order\nof 103 K (see, e.g., Ref. 7, pp. 70-82). Furthermore, since the evolution of the universe\nis inflationary during the prematter eras, we have\nc4 and c3 \u2208 (\u22121, 0) .\n\n(15)\n\nIt is evident from Eqs. (14) and (15) that as the numerical value of the term\n(4l4,3 /\u03c0lpl ) gets far from unity, the present value of the density predicted in Eq. (14)\nfalls rapidly below 10\u221231 gr/cm3 which represents the order of the present value of\nthe total density. Hence, we may conclude that a phase transition is signalled when\nthe critical length parameter approaches the Planck length of the lower dimension.\nWe also note that while our model is insensitive to the choice of c3 , its predictions strongly depend on the choice of c4 and H(0). We get numerical results\nthat comply with recent observations8 only when c4 gets numerical values close\nto -1 and H(0) remains at the order of 1063 km/sec.mpc. As a specific example, we took Tm = 3000 K and considered the following choices of parameters:\nH(0) = 1.6 * 1063 km/sec.mpc and l4,3 = 1.4 * 10\u221233 cm. For this particular case, it\nis to be noted that only for a narrow range of initial conditions corresponding to the\nvalues of c4 between \u22120.99145 and \u22120.99141, outcomes of this specific model are\nwithin the observed ranges for the cosmological parameters, i.e., Hubble constant\nH0 (60 km/sec.mpc \u2212 80 km/sec.mpc), age t0 (1.2 * 1010 yrs \u2212 1.6 * 1010 yrs) and\ndensity \u03c10 (\u223c 10\u221231 gr/cm3 ).\nReferences\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n7.\n8.\n\nM.
