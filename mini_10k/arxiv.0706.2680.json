In this exposition we will examine some of\nthe more basic points of dimensional continuation, with an emphasis on the Coulomb logarithm for\nelectron-ion temperature equilibration. Dimensional continuation, or dimensional regularization as\nit is more properly known in quantum field theory, was originally developed as part of the renormalization procedure for the theories of the electroweak and other fundamental interactions in particle\nphysics. Dimensional continuation is so general, in fact, that any theory can be unambiguously\nlifted to dimensions beyond three, and therefore the technique is powerful enough to apply in many\nother settings. The technique, however, is not well known outside the field theory and particle\nphysics communities. This exposition will therefore be self-contained, intended for those who are\nnot specialists in quantum field theory, and I will either derive or motivate any requisite field theory results or concepts. Of particular relevance is the analogy between the Coulomb logarithm as\ncalculated by Lyman Spitzer on the one hand, and the Lamb shift as calculated by Hans Bethe on\nthe other. While dimensional continuation is a well developed and a thoroughly tested method for\nregularizing any quantum field theory, BPS employs the method in a novel way that provides the\nleading and subleading behavior for processes that involve competing disparate energy or length\nscales. In particular, BPS calculated the temperature equilibration rate to leading and next-toleading order in the plasma number density for any two species in a plasma that are in thermal\nequilibrium with themselves, but not necessarily with each other. No restriction is made on the\ncharge, mass, or the temperature of the plasma species. It is, however, assumed that the plasma is\nnot strongly coupled in the sense that the dimensionless plasma coupling parameter g = e2 \u03baD /4\u03c0T\nis small, where \u03baD is the Debye wave number of the plasma. To leading and next-to-leading order\nin this coupling, the temperature equilibration rate is of the generic form \u0393 = A g 2 ln{Cg}. The\nprecise numerical coefficient A in front of the logarithm has been known for some time, while BPS\nhave recently computed the constant C under the logarithm. It should be emphasized that the\nBPS result is not a model, but rather it is an exact calculation of the leading terms in a welldefined perturbation theory.

This calculation was first performed in Section 12 of Ref. [1], a work whose primary focus was the\ncharged particle stopping power in a plasma.1 This paper assumed familiarity with a number of field theory concepts, and Section 12 relied heavily on the charged particle stopping\npower results derived in previous sections of that work. In contrast, these lectures will be\nself-contained. I will either derive or motivate the requisite field theory background for a\ncomplete reading of Ref. [1], with an emphasis on some of the subtleties of the calculational\ntechniques and the concepts behind them (this lecture). More to the point, since the rate\ncalculation stands on its own, it should be presented on its own (the following lecture). Indeed, since the calculation of the rate is somewhat less involved than that of the stopping\npower, it more clearly illustrates the tools and concepts imported from field theory.\nIn addition to clarifying the method of dimensional continuation, this lecture will place\nRef. [1] in the context of more familiar and traditional approaches to the rate problem.\nIn particular, I will show that dimensional continuation can be viewed as a systematic\nimplementation of the approach based on convergent kinetic equations. Finally, in in the next\nlecture, I will go on to derive the main result from Section 12 of Ref. [1], the rate coefficient\n(1.3) of this lecture. By working in the Born approximation, and adopting the methods\nof Ref. [3], I will derive this result in a much simpler manner than originally presented in\nRef. [1]. While Lectures I and II are self-contained, they are complementary and should be\nread as a unit.2\nThe strategy employed by Ref. [1], hereafter referred to as BPS, consists of two steps.\nFirst, we will find a dimensionless parameter in which to perform a controlled perturbative\nexpansion of the rate, expanding to leading and next-to-leading order in this parameter.\n1\n2\n\nFor a short cursory version of this work, see Ref. [2].\nIn other words, Lecture I (this lecture) consists of the basic theory and techniques behind dimensional continuation, while Lecture II (next lecture) will be a specific calculation in the extreme quantum limit: only\nby performing a calculation can one understand the underlying ideas of the calculation. Ideally, I would\nthen like to continue these first two lectures with three additional ones. In Lecture III, I would present the\nfull calculation of the temperature relaxation rate performed in Ref. [1], valid beyond the Born approximation. The full calculation is accurate for a weakly to moderately coupled plasma in both the classical\nand quantum limits, and any regime in-between, regardless of the mass and temperature difference of the\nplasma species. I would then present the details of the full quantum corrections in Lecture IV. Finally, in\nLecture V, I would come full circle, simplifying the general equilibration rate calculated in Lectures III and\nIV to obtain the extreme quantum limit of Lecture II, equation (1.3) of this lecture. This would provide\ntwo independent calculations of the rate (1.3), but alas, time does not permit these last three supplements.\n\n1\n\n\fSecond, we will deploy a technique from quantum field theory that will allow us to calculate\nthe coefficients of these leading and subleading terms exactly. The exact leading order term\nis not very difficult to find, and has been known since the classic work of Spitzer. The\nnext-to-leading order term, on the other hand, was not known exactly until the recent BPS\ncalculation. The third-order term provides an estimate of the error of the calculation. When\nthe plasma is weakly to moderately coupled, the error will be small and the rate will be\napproximated quite accurately by the first two terms of this expansion.\nTo calculate the expansion coefficients, we will exploit a field theory technique known\nas dimensional regularization (or dimensional continuation, as I will call it here). This\napplication of dimensional continuation is quite different from its intended purpose in the\nrenormalization procedure of quantum field theory. Dimensional continuation was originally\ndeveloped as an elegant regularization scheme in which the fundamental symmetries of a\nfield theory could be maintained while still rendering finite the otherwise infinite integrals\nthat arise when calculating Feynman diagrams. I will show how this technique can be used\nin a novel fashion to extract next-to-leading order physics that has, until now, remained\ninaccessible. In other words, I will show how dimensional continuation provides an exact\nresult for the corresponding Coulomb logarithm of the process in question. I will also take\nthe opportunity to correct a small algebra mistake for the electron-ion equilibration rate\npresented in Section 12 of Ref. [1].\n\nA.\n\nThe Problem\n\nThe general formalism starts with a plasma composed of multiple species labeled by\nan index b, the various species being delineated by of a common electric charge eb and a\ncommon mass mb .3 Each species is assumed to be in thermal equilibrium with itself at\ntemperature Tb with a spatially uniform number density nb . I will drop the subscript on\nthe charge of the electron and write eelectron = \u2212e (with e > 0), although the electron mass\nwill be denoted by me , and the number density and temperature of the electron plasma\ncomponent by ne and Te respectively. I will use a lower case subscript i to denote a single\nion species of charge ei = Zi e, mass mi , number density ni , and temperature Ti . I will\n3\n\nThe final constraint of BPS is that the ionization state of each component species does not change. In other\nwords, the charges can be expressed as eb = Zb e with Zb fixed. While this simplifying assumption has its\nlimitations, it facilitates the analytic calculation of the stopping power and temperature equilibration rate.\nHowever, one can take the Zb to be fractional to mock-up ionization in a simple manner. Or better yet,\nit should be possible to combine the BPS results with models of the ionization effects. For a hot low-Z\nplasmas, such as a deuterium-tritium plasma during ICF ignition, the ions are likely to be fully ionized in\nany event, so this is not a serious restriction for clean thermonuclear burn with low-Z impurities.\n\n2\n\n\femploy a capital-I subscript to denote properties that correspond to the collective set of ions,\nP\nsuch as the total ion number density nI = i ni or a common ion temperature TI . When\nequilibrium distributions are required in calculations, they are assumed to be MaxwellBoltzmann, although a generalization to Fermi-Dirac statistics can be accomplished with\nmore effort [3]. For problems involving hot thermonuclear burn, however, the fugacity is\nsmall and Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics is an accurate approximation.\nLet dEab /dt denote rate at which the energy density of plasma species a changes because of\nits Coulomb interactions with another species b (the rate from the a-species to the b-species).\nThis rate is proportional to the temperature difference, and can be expressed by\ndEab\n= \u2212 Cab (Ta \u2212 Tb ) .\ndt\n\n(1.1)\n\nThe sign convention in (1.1) implies that when the rate coefficients Cab are positive, then\nenergy will flow from the hotter species to the cooler species, as it must. Section 12 of\nBPS used dimensional continuation to calculate the general rate coefficients Cab in a weakly\ncoupled, but otherwise arbitrary, plasma. For simplicity, we will not perform the general\ncalculation until Lecture III. In this and the following lecture, we will concentrate on the\nenergy exchange between electrons and ions only. Since the electron mass me is so much\nsmaller than a typical ion mass mI , the electrons will come into equilibrium first with temp\nperature Te on some time scale \u03c4e . The energy transfer rate among ions is a factor me /mI\nslower than the corresponding rate for electrons, and therefore the ions will equilibrate\np\nto a common temperature TI in a time \u03c4I \u223c \u03c4e mI /me . Finally, as the electrons and\nions exchange energy through Coulomb interactions, these systems too will equilibrate on a\np\ntime scale \u03c4eI \u223c \u03c4I mI /me \u223c \u03c4e (mI /me ). Consequently, one finds a hierarchy of time scales\n\u03c4e \u226a \u03c4I \u226a \u03c4eI , and it indeed makes sense to consider the electron and ion systems as having\ndistinct temperatures Te and TI , with subsequent equilibration between them. Taking a = e\nand b = i in (1.1), and since the ions have a common temperature Ti = TI , the rate equation\nof interest is obtained by summing over the ion components of (1.1) to give\ndEeI\n= \u2212 CeI (Te \u2212 TI ) ,\n(1.2)\ndt\nP\nP\nwhere CeI = i Cei and dEeI/dt = i dEei /dt.\nThe coefficient CeI is the quantity we wish to calculate in this and the next lecture. This\ncoefficient contains the energy-exchange physics between electrons and ions resulting from\nmutual Coulomb interactions, including possible collective effects and large-angle collisions.\nGeneral expressions for the individual Cei were calculated in Section 12 of BPS. They are\nsomewhat complicated and involve various one-dimensional integrals that can only be performed numerically. However, the collective rate coefficient CeI simplifies considerably when\n3\n\n\fthe mild restriction me /Te \u226a mI /TI is imposed (a sum-rule is employed in the approximaP\ntion, and the simplification occurs only for CeI = i Cei and not for the individual Cei ). If\nthe high temperature limit is further imposed, then the rate can be written in a quite simple\nanalytic form.\nFor me /Te \u226a mI /TI and Te,I \u226b \u01ebH :\n\u0015\n\u0014 \u001a 2\u001b\nr\n\u03ba2e 2\nme\n1\n8Te\nCeI =\nln \u039bBPS , with ln \u039bBPS =\nln 2 2 \u2212 \u03b3 \u2212 1 ,\n\u03c9\n2\u03c0 I 2\u03c0 Te\n2\n~ \u03c9e\n\n(1.3)\n\nwhere \u03b3 = 0.57721 * * * is the Euler constant, \u03bae and \u03c9e are the electron Debye wave number\nP\nand plasma frequency, and \u03c9I2 = i \u03c9i2 is sum of the squares of the ion plasma frequencies.\nSince the small binding energy \u01ebH = 13.6 eV of the hydrogen atom sets the temperature scale,\nand since the condition me /Te \u226a mI /TI is not very restrictive, the rate coefficient (1.3) is\napplicable in almost all circumstances of interest. We shall devote the next lecture to deriving\nthis expression. For now, note that equation (1.3) corresponds to Eqs. (3.61) and (12.12)\nof Ref. [1], where I have taken this opportunity to correct a small transcription error: when\npassing from Eq. (12.43) to Eq. (12.44) in Ref. [1], a factor of 1/2 was dropped. Restoring\nthis factor of 1/2 changes the additive constant outside the logarithm from the \u2212\u03b3 \u2212 2 that\nappears in Eq. (12.12) of Ref. [1] to the constant \u2212\u03b3 \u2212 1 in (1.3) above.\nFor reasons to be discussed shortly, rationalized units are preferred for dimensional continuation, and I will employ this choice in all that follows. Nonetheless, expression (1.3) is\n\nwritten in a manner that does not depend upon this choice: the Debye wave number \u03bae , and\nthe plasma frequencies \u03c9e and \u03c9i can be calculated in your favorite units. For example, in\nGaussian units where the electric potential takes the form V = e2 /r, the Debye wave number\nand the plasma frequency of species b are given by \u03ba2b = 4\u03c0 e2b nb /Tb and \u03c9b2 = 4\u03c0 e2b nb /mb .\nIn the rationalized units employed here, the electric potential is given by V = e2 /4\u03c0r, and\nwe have\n\u03ba2b =\n\ne2b nb\nTb\n\n(1.4)\n\ne2b nb\n.\n(1.5)\nmb\nP\nThe square of the total Debye wave number is \u03ba2D = b \u03ba2b , and the total Debye wave length\n\u03c9b2 =\n\nis \u03bbD = \u03ba\u22121\nD .\n\n4\n\n\fB.\n\nThe Problem with the Problem\n\nLet us now consider an arbitrary plasma component of mass m, which I will otherwise\nleave unspecified, and let f (v, t) denote the Boltzmann distribution for this species. Then\nthe average (kinetic) energy density of this component is\nZ\n1\nE = d3 v mv 2 f (v, t) .\n(1.6)\n2\nIf we work to leading and next-to-leading order in the number density, calculating the energy\nexchange between plasma components will then involve keeping a tally only of the kinetic\nenergy, as in (1.6). This is because the potential energy is higher order in the number\ndensity [or more precisely, the potential energy is higher order in the plasma coupling g, to\nbe defined later in (4.2)]. As the system interacts with other plasma components through\nmutual Coulomb interactions, it will loose or gain energy depending on the temperature\ngradients with other species, and the energy exchange rate is given by\nZ\n1\n\u2202f\ndE\n= d3 v mv 2\n(v, t) .\n(1.7)\ndt\n2\n\u2202t\nIn contrast to (1.1) and (1.2), for ease of notation I have temporarily dropped the plasma\ncomponent subscripts on the rate, and I will keep with this convention until the final calculation presented in Section VI B. We see that the entire problem is bound up in calculating\nthe rate of change \u2202f /\u2202t from an appropriate kinetic equation that captures the relevant\nphysics. As it turns out, however, there is a serious problem in performing all such calculation with the Coulomb potential in three dimensions: the integrals in the kinetic equations\ndiverge logarithmically, and they do so at both large and small distances.4\nFor processes in which large-angle scattering is important, such as the charged particle\nstopping power, it is natural to use the Boltzmann equation, which I will write in the\nabbreviated form\n\u2202f\n+ v*\u2207f = B[f ] ,\n\u2202t\n\n(1.8)\n\nwhere \u2207 is the gradient in position space, and B[f ] is the scattering kernel, whose precise\nform will not concern us until the next lecture. The gradient vanishes because of spatial\nuniformity, so we will set v * \u2207f = 0. The Boltzmann equation was designed to account\nfor the statistical effects of short-distance collisions, and although its original context was\nclassical, quantum two-body scattering effects can easily be incorporated. In fact, since the\n4\n\nIt is curious that this problem occurs for the Coulomb potential only in three dimensions, the case of most\nphysical relevance in plasma physics.\n\n5\n\n\fscattering phase shifts \u03b4l are known analytically for the Coulomb potential, Ref. [1] used this\nto calculate the two-body quantum corrections to all orders [in the quantum parameter \u03b7\nto be defined in (4.14)]. The kernel B[f ] therefore contains all short-distance or ultraviolet\nphysics, for both classical and quantum scattering. However, (in three spatial dimensions)\nthe Coulomb potential is long-range, and the integrals in B[f ] diverge in the infrared; or\nequivalently, if we write the scattering kernel B[f ] in terms of momentum integrals, the\ndivergence appears at small values of momentum. This was not a problem in Boltzmann's\noriginal formulation of (1.8), since the Coulomb potential was unknown at that time, and he\nmodeled particle collisions in terms of hard-sphere scattering. In summary, the Boltzmann\nequation gets the short-distance physics correct, including quantum two-body scattering,\nbut it misses the infrared physics. The fact that the Boltzmann equation misses the longdistance physics manifests itself as an infrared divergence in the scattering kernel B[f ],\nthereby rendering calculations meaningless (unless we tame, or regularize, this divergence).\nGiven that the Boltzmann equation misses the long-distance or infrared (IR) physics, we\nmight be tempted to try the Lenard-Balescu equation, which I will write in the abbreviated\nform\n\u2202f\n+ v*\u2207f = L[f ] ,\n\u2202t\n\n(1.9)\n\nwhere L[f ] is a scattering kernel whose exact form will be needed only in the next lecture.\nAgain, the gradient term will be set to zero because of spatial uniformity. The Lenard-Balescu\nequation takes the form of a Fokker-Plank equation, with the kernel L[f ] chosen to capture\nthe correct IR physics. However, for the Coulomb potential (in three spatial dimensions),\nthe Lenard-Balescu equation misses the short-distance or ultraviolet (UV) physics, and this\nis manifested by a UV divergence in L[f ]. The situation for the Lenard-Balescu equation\nis exactly reversed compared to that of the Boltzmann equation. This is what Ref. [4] calls\nthe \"complementarity\" of these two kinetic equations, and in the dimensional continuation\nprocedure we will use this fact to our advantage.\n\nII.\n\nTRADITIONAL METHODS\nA.\n\nHeuristic Models\n\nThe rate equation (1.7) reduces to a one-dimensional integral over the entire range of\nphysical length scales (or momentum scales, if one so chooses), from zero all the way to\ninfinity. Trouble arises for the Coulomb potential in three dimensions since the integral in\nquestion is logarithmically divergent at both integration limits. We must therefore regulate\n6\n\n\fthe integral in some manner. Dimensional continuation is one such procedure, but there are\nothers. This divergence problem was first worked around by simply cutting off the divergent\nintegrals by hand, with the cutoffs themselves being chosen by physical arguments (rather\nthan a calculation).\nThe energy exchange rate we are considering is but an example of a larger class of problems\ninvolving characteristic, but disparate, length or energy scales in which the measured quantity of interest is (logarithmically) insensitive to the physics above and below these scales.\nFor these problems, the simplest and most intuitive regularization scheme is to replace the\noffending integration limits, i.e. infinity and zero, by the finite and non-zero physical scales\nof the problem. These two scales then act as formal integration cutoffs, giving a finite logarithm of the ratio of the scales. Furthermore, because the system is insensitive to the physics\nabove and below the respective cutoffs, this procedure provides a physically meaningful result. Expressed in terms of length, we will denote the long- and short-distance scales by bmax\nand bmin , and the integral over scales leads to a finite logarithm involving the ratio of the\nphysical length scales, so that\n\u001b\n\u001a\ndE\nbmax\n,\n(2.1)\n= K ln\ndt\nbmin\nwhere K is an easily determined prefactor with dimensions of energy density per unit time.\nAs we shall see, a calculation to leading order in the number density is sufficient to provide\nthe coefficient K, while a next-to-leading order calculation is required to find the exact terms\nunder the logarithm.\nThe problem with this regularization prescription, which I will call the heuristic scheme,\nis that we can only estimate the values of the physical scales bmax and bmin to within factors\nof order one or so. For example, it is physically reasonable that the scale of the long\ndistance cutoff in a plasma is set by a Debye length, so that bmax = c \u03ba\u22121\nwith c being\nD\na dimensionless constant of order unity; but what determines the exact value of c ? In\nfact, how does bmax \u223c \u03ba\u22121\narise naturally from the kinetic equations themselves, rather than\nD\nsimply being chosen by hand? And should one use the total Debye wave number \u03baD , or just\nthe contribution from the electrons \u03bae ? The origin of the short distance cutoff bmin is even less\nclear. In the extreme classical limit, we expect this scale to be set by the classical distance of\nclosest approach rcl between two colliding particles, so that bmin \u223c rcl .5 On the other hand, we\n\nexpect quantum effects to dominate when rcl becomes smaller than some thermal Compton\nwavelength rqm \u223c ~/q, with q being a typical thermally averaged momentum transfer. In\n5\n\nA further ambiguity arises in precisely defining rcl , as this involves a somewhat arbitrary choice in the\nthermal averaging procedure.\n\n7\n\n\fthis case we expect bmin \u223c rqm . Worse yet, the intermediate region in which neither classical\nnor quantum processes dominate is often realized in a weakly coupled plasma, and in this\ncase it is even more obscure how one should choose bmin . We must interpolate between the\nextreme classical and the extreme quantum scales, but in the literature the exact procedure\nis always somewhat ad hoc. For example, a common choice is to define b2min to be the sum\nof the squares of the classical and quantum scales, so that\n\u00111/2\n\u0010\n2\nbmin = rcl2 + rqm\n.\n(2.2)\nI will have more to say about this in Section IV A 3.\nThe heuristic scheme forces us to choose the specific forms of bmax and bmin motivated\nby imprecise physical arguments or heuristic exercises, which leads us into the art of model\nbuilding rather than systematic calculation. Indeed, the very notation that we must choose\na cutoff is misleading, since the physics itself must conspire to render all integrals finite.\nConsequently, the heuristic method suffers from an unknown coefficient under the logarithm,\nand only the approximate value of the ratio bmax /bmin can be determined with this method\n(in fact, this ratio varies across an order of magnitude over models in the literature, rather\nthan factors of two or three). As we shall see, determining the constant under the logarithm\nexactly is equivalent to determining the next-to-leading order term exactly; therefore, models\nof the form (2.1) are accurate only to leading order, and no better.\n\nB.\n\nConvergent Kinetic Equations: Traditional Approach\n\nRather than merely regulating the integrals in a rate derived from the kinetic equations,\nas with (2.1), a more sophisticated approach involves regularizing the divergences in the\nkinetic equations themselves. In other words, the theory itself is regularized, rather than a\nparticular quantity being calculated within the theory. The method of dimensional continuation falls into this category, albeit with somewhat more subtle mathematical machinery\nthan traditional approaches. These approaches, of which Refs. [5, 6, 7] are good examples,\nare summarized and placed into a common framework by Aono in Ref. [4]. As discussed in\nSection I B of this lecture, one can view the Boltzmann and Leonard-Balescu equations as\nproviding complementary physics since they both succeed and fail in complementary regimes.\nThe Boltzmann equation gets the short-distance physics correct, while the Leonard-Balescu\nequation captures the long-distance physics; conversely, Boltzmann and Leonard-Balescu\nmiss the long- and short-distance physics, respectively. This complementarity motivates a\nclass of kinetic equations of the form [4]\n\u2202f\n+ v*\u2207f = B[f ] + L[f ] \u2212 R[f ] ,\n\u2202t\n8\n\n(2.3)\n\n\fwhere R[f ] is a carefully chosen \"regulating kernel\" designed to subtract the long-distance\ndivergence of the Boltzmann equation and the short-distance divergence of the LenardBalescu equation. At the same time, the kernel R[f ] must preserve the correct short-distance\nphysics of the Boltzmann equation and the correct long-distance physics of the LenardBalescu equation (a minimal requirement of the regulating kernel R[f ] is that it take a\nHippocratic Oath to do no harm, at least to subleading order in the plasma coupling).\nEach term on the right-hand-side of (2.3) is separately divergent, but collectively they lead\nto a finite collision kernel if properly interpreted.6 As an example, Gould and DeWitt [7]\nregulated the long-distance divergence of the Boltzmann equation by simply replacing the\nCoulomb potential with a Debye screened Yukawa-like potential,\ne2 \u2212\u03baD r\nVdebye (r) =\ne\n,\n4\u03c0r\n\n(2.4)\n\nwhere, as not to confuse symbols, I write e as the base of the natural logarithm and e as the\nelectric charge. While Ref. [7] performed this operation by hand using physical arguments,\none could easily introduce a kernel R[f ] to do the same.\nWhile the approach to convergent kinetic equations described by Aono might appear to\nbe more rigorous than the aforementioned model building approach of (2.1), it is no more\nsystematic: methods based on (2.3) or its equivalent do not contain the ability to estimate\ntheir own error, i.e. they cannot determine their domain of applicability. There is nothing in\nthe formalism of (2.3) that keeps track of the plasma coupling constant, or the order to which\nwe are working in this constant. Indeed, one does not generally think of (2.3) in terms of a\nperturbation theory. In contrast, Ref. [1] calculates the rate using a systematic expansion in\nthe plasma number density, or more precisely, in a dimensionless plasma coupling parameter\ng [to be defined by (4.2) and discussed at length in Section IV A]. Although written in a\ndisguised form, the BPS rate coefficient (1.3) is an expansion to leading and next-to-leading\norder in the coupling parameter: the leading order term goes like g 2 ln g, the next-to-leading\norder is proportional to g 2 , and the O(g 3 ) term provides an estimate of the error. Translating\nthe work of Gould and DeWitt [7] into the language of a perturbative expansion in a plasma\ncoupling constant, it turns out that their result is valid to order g 2 and is in agreement with\n6\n\nBy \"properly interpreted\" I really mean that each term on the right-hand-side of (2.3) should be separately\nregularized in some manner, rendering the individual kernels B[f ], L[f ], and R[f ] separately finite: B[f ]\nmust be regulated at long-distances, L[f ] at short-distances, and R[f ] at both long- and short-distances.\nIf this procedure is executed correctly, so that the long-distance divergences of R[f ] and B[f ] cancel, as do\nthe short-distance divergences of R[f ] and L[f ], both in a consistent fashion, then the entire right-handside of (2.3) remains finite as the cutoffs are removed. If R[f ] does not disturb the O(g 2 ) physics, then the\nconvergent kinetic equation will be accurate to O(g 2 ). I will have more to say about how one regulates\nlong- and short-distances consistently in Section V, and how this can be a quite non-trivial process.\n\n9\n\n\fBPS to this order.7 However, in their final result, Gould and DeWitt retain spurious higher\norder terms in g 3 . I call these terms \"spurious\" because Ref. [7] did not calculate the full set\nof order g 3 terms, but only some of these terms. Indeed, the notion of a systematic expansion\nin a small dimensionless parameter does not enter their calculational framework. As this\nexample shows, convergent kinetic equations can be more accurate than the heuristic model\nbuilding technique of the previous section, but one cannot be sure of their accuracy until a\ncomparison with a systematic calculation has been made, as with BPS and Ref. [7].\n\nIII.\nA.\n\nBESSEL FUNCTION EXAMPLE\nAnalogy with Dimensional Continuation\n\nI will illustrate the main points of dimensional continuation with an example involving\nthe modified Bessel function K0 (x), with an emphasis on analytic continuation and how this\ncan be used to extract leading and next-to-leading order behavior. This example was first\npresented in Ref. [8], and for pedagogical purposes it was also included in Appendix A of\nRef. [1]. This example contains all the essential features of dimensional continuation, but in\na mathematically simple form, and while it is an imperfect analogy, as all analogies are, it\nis explicit in all its details. We will show that the modified Bessel function K0 (x) has the\nexpansion\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\ne\u03b3\nK0 (x) = | \u2212 {z\nln x } + ln 2 \u2212 \u03b3 + O(x ) = \u2212 ln\nx + O(x2 ) ,\n| {z }\n2\n2\n\nLO\n\nNLO\n\n(3.1)\n\nto leading order (LO) and next-to-leading order (NLO) in x, with \u03b3 = 0.577216 * * * denoting\nEuler's constant. This expansion is quite accurate for small values x, with an error of order\nx2 rather than x for symmetry reasons. The asymptotic expansion (3.1) is a well known\nresult [9], but it is rather difficult to prove by conventional methods because of the nonanalytic leading-log behavior. However, the method of dimensional continuation allows us\nto derive this result rather easily. The price one pays for this ease of derivation is that one\nmust learn (or recall) a bit of mathematical machinery which, at first sight, seems unrelated\nto the problem at hand.\nWe start with the general integral representation of the modified Bessel functions [10],\n\u0012\n\u0013\u001b\n\u001a\nZ\n1\nx\n1 \u221e\n\u03bd\u22121\nk+\n.\n(3.2)\ndk k\nexp \u2212\nK\u03bd (x) =\n2 0\n2\nk\n7\n\nFor a detailed treatment of Gould and DeWitt in the context of BPS, see Appendix B of Ref. [1].\n\n10\n\n\fAs the notation in (3.2) suggests, we can think of \u03bd as the dimension of space and the\nintegration variable k as the wave number. In this analogy, the argument x corresponds to\nthe dimensionless coupling parameter g of the plasma. The following dictionary provides a\nuseful mnemonic in relating this mathematical example to the plasma physics problem of\nreal interest:\nx \u2192 plasma coupling g\n\u03bd \u2192 spatial dimension\nk \u2192 wave number\n\u03bd\u22121\ndk k\n\u2192 integration measure d\u03bd k .\n\n(3.3)\n\nPushing our physical analogy further, if we think of \u03bd as being the dimension of space,\nthen it should always be a positive integer, which I will express by the conventional set\ntheory notation \u03bd \u2208 Z+ ; however, nothing per se in the integral representation (3.2) requires\n\nthat \u03bd \u2208 Z+ . We can therefore think of \u03bd in expression (3.2) as being a continuous real\nvariable (\u03bd \u2208 R), or indeed, a complex variable (\u03bd \u2208 C) if circumstances warrant. Similarly,\n\nfor a real physical system written in the appropriate integral form, there is nothing in any law\nof physics that prevents us from interpreting the dimension of space \u03bd as being a complex\n\nnumber. Continuing \u03bd from the positive integers into the complex plane is what I mean\nby \"dimensional continuation.\" There will be times when we restrict our attention to the\nreal numbers only, rather than the complex numbers in general, and I will refer to this as\ndimensional continuation as well. As we shall see, this procedure of taking \u03bd \u2208 R or \u03bd \u2208 C\nwill allow us to regulate otherwise infinite integrals in a systematic and perturbative fashion.\nFinite manipulations can then be performed, the divergent poles will cancel from physically\nmeasurable quantities, and afterward we can take \u03bd to the appropriate integer dimension (in\nthis analogy we take \u03bd \u2192 0, rather than \u03bd \u2192 3 as we do for the physics problem).\nB.\n\nLeading Order Terms\n\nLet us first calculate the leading order in x behavior of K\u03bd (x) for positive and negative\nvalues of \u03bd. For small positive values of x, the leading order x-behavior can be obtained by\nreplacing the exponential in (3.2) by one, except in the regions k \u2192 0 and k \u2192 \u221e, where the\nexponential is required for convergence. Taking \u03bd < 0 first, note that the integral (3.2) is\ndominated by small values of k near the lower limit of integration. In terms of the analogy\n(3.3) where k is a wave number, this corresponds to the situation in which long-distance IR\nphysics is dominant. Therefore, when \u03bd < 0 and the integral is dominated by small values of\n\n11\n\n\fk, the leading order contribution to (3.2) can be obtained from the leading order behavior\nof the exponential, that is to say, the replacement\n\u0012\n\u0013\u001b\n\u001a\nn x o\nx\n1\nexp \u2212\nk+\n\u2192 exp \u2212\nwith |x| \u226a 1, \u03bd < 0\n(3.4)\n2\nk\n2k\nwill capture the entire leading order in x behavior for negative values of \u03bd. Note that\n(3.4) provides convergence as k \u2192 0, while large-k convergence is provided by the prefactor\n\nk \u03bd\u22121 since \u03bd < 0. We will denote this leading order contribution by K\u03bd< (x), and using the\nsubstitution (3.4) we write\nZ\n1 \u221e\n1 \u0010 x \u0011\u03bd\n<\nK\u03bd (x) =\ndk k \u03bd\u22121 e\u2212x/2k =\n\u0393(\u2212\u03bd) .\n(3.5)\n2 0\n2 2\nIn the last equality of (3.5), we have made the variable change y = x/2k, and we have used\nthe standard integral representation for the Gamma function,\nZ \u221e\n\u0393(z) =\ndy y z\u22121 e\u2212y .\n(3.6)\n0\n\nThis representation of the Gamma function only converges when z > 0 (actually, (3.6) is\nvalid over the complex z-plane with Re z > 0). When z = \u2212\u03bd and \u03bd < 0, we may indeed use\n\n(3.6).\nWe can find the leading order in x contribution when \u03bd > 0 in a similar manner. In this\ncase, the integral is dominated by large values of k at the upper limit of integration, and we\nmake the substitution\n\u0012\n\u0013\u001b\n\u001a\n\u001b\n\u001a\n1\nxk\nx\nk+\n\u2192 exp \u2212\nwith |x| \u226a 1 , \u03bd > 0 ,\n(3.7)\nexp \u2212\n2\nk\n2\nthereby giving the leading order result\nZ\n1 \u221e\n1 \u0010 x \u0011\u2212\u03bd\n>\nK\u03bd (x) =\ndk k \u03bd\u22121 e\u2212xk/2 =\n\u0393(\u03bd) .\n2 0\n2 2\n\n(3.8)\n\nNote that the exponential provides convergence as k \u2192 \u221e, while the integrand possesses an\n\nintegrable singularity at k = 0 for 0 < \u03bd < 1 (the integrand is non-singular at k = 0 when\n\u03bd \u2265 1).\nWe will eventually take the \u03bd \u2192 0 limits of (3.5) and (3.8), since we are interested in\n\nK0 (x) and not K\u03bd (x). While we could take \u03bd to be a general real or complex number\nuntil the limit is required, it is easier to consider only small values of \u03bd from the start (we\n\nneed work no higher than linear order, since this and higher orders vanish when \u03bd \u2192 0).\n\n12\n\n\fTo do this, we expand the Gamma function \u0393(\u00b1\u03bd) to linear-order in its argument using\n\u0393(z) = 1/z \u2212 \u03b3 + O(z). Taking z = \u00b1\u03bd in this expansion gives\ni\n1 \u0010 x \u0011\u2212\u03bd h\n1 \u2212 \u03bd\u03b3\n2\u03bd 2\ni\n1 \u0010 x \u0011\u03bd h\n<\nK\u03bd (x) = \u2212\n1 + \u03bd\u03b3\n2\u03bd 2\nK\u03bd> (x) =\n\n: LO in x when \u03bd > 0\n\n(3.9)\n\n: LO in x when \u03bd < 0 .\n\n(3.10)\n\nExpressions (3.9) and (3.10) are accurate to linear order in the dimension \u03bd; on the other\nhand, (3.9) gives the leading order in x contribution to K\u03bd (x) as defined by (3.2) when \u03bd > 0,\nand (3.10) gives the leading order in x contribution to K\u03bd (x) when \u03bd < 0. To compare these\ntwo expressions, we must analytically continue them to a common dimension. We will discuss\nthis further in the next section.\nIn terms of our physics analogy, expression (3.9) captures the leading order short-distance\nphysics in the \u03bd > 0 regime; the pole at \u03bd = 0 corresponds to a small-k divergence, which,\npushing our physical analogy again, would reflect missing or incomplete long-distance physics\n(as with the Boltzmann equation). The situation is completely reversed for (3.10), which captures the leading order long-distance physics for \u03bd > 0, with the pole at \u03bd = 0 corresponding\nto a large-k divergence arising from missing short-distance physics (like the Lenard-Balescu\nequation). As functions of \u03bd, we see from (3.9) and (3.10) that K\u03bd> (x) and K\u03bd< (x) are analytic in \u03bd, except for the simple pole at \u03bd = 0. As we shall see, the analytic continuation\nto complex \u03bd takes the same functional form as the individual expressions (3.9) and (3.10),\neach defined separately for \u03bd > 0 and \u03bd < 0, respectively.\n\nC.\n\nSome Comments on Analytic Continuation\n\nSince analytic continuation plays such a central role in dimensional continuation, at least\nmathematically, I would like to briefly discuss the conditions under which a function can be\nanalytically continued from one region of the complex plane to another. Recall that a function\nf is said to be analytic at a point z0 in the complex plane C, if and only if its derivative exists\nnot only at z0 , but also at every point within some open neighborhood of z0 . A function\nf is analytic on a domain D in the complex plane if it is analytic at each point in D.\nAnalyticity is a very stringent condition on a function, since the existence of the derivative\nof a complex function is a much more robust constraint than the corresponding existence\nof the derivative of a function on a real domain. This is because in the two-dimensional\ncomplex plane, the limiting procedure defining the derivative must exist regardless of the\ndirection used in taking the limit. In fact, analyticity at a point z0 is so strong that it implies\nthe existence and continuity of all derivatives f (n) (z0 ) for any order n > 0 [11]. In other\n13\n\n\fwords, an analytic function on D can be thought of as being infinitely smooth on D, even\nthough the definition of analyticity itself invokes only the existence of the first derivative,\nalbeit on a neighborhood.\nAnalyticity is such a stringent condition, that the behavior of an analytic function in a\nsmall domain is enough to determine its behavior in a larger region. Even if the function\nis only known along a one-dimensional curve in the complex plane, such as a portion of the\nreal axis, this is enough to uniquely determine the function in the complex plane.8 This is\nbecause the derivatives of an analytic function exist to all orders, and therefore a Taylor\nseries expansion about a point of analyticity always exists with some non-zero radius of\nconvergence. For example, one of the powers of analytic continuation is that the original\nfunction may be defined in any manner over a subregion, and this can generate a unique\nfunction over a larger region. As an application of this, take the analytic function defined\nby the infinite geometric series\nf (z) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nzn ,\n\n(3.11)\n\nn=0\n\na series that converges only for |z| < 1. Upon defining f by (3.11), we therefore take the\ndomain D1 to be the unit disk about the origin, excluding the unit circle itself. In this\ndomain, the geometric series converges to\n\u221e\nX\nn=0\n\nzn =\n\n1\n1\u2212z\n\nfor z \u2208 D1 .\n\n(3.12)\n\nNote, however, that the function g(z) = 1/(1 \u2212 z) is defined over the entire complex plane\n\nexcept z = 1, a region I will call C1 . Since the function f is only defined within the unit\ncircle, and since f and g agree within the unit circle, the function g : C1 \u2192 C is the unique\nanalytic continuation of f : D1 \u2192 C.\nAs a more relevant example, consider K\u03bd< (x) with \u03bd < 0 as given by (3.10). To compare\n\nthis with K\u03bd> (x), which is determined by (3.9) for \u03bd > 0, we must analytically continue\nK\u03bd< (x) to the positive real \u03bd-axis. We can think of K\u03bd< (x) as a sequence of functions of\nan independent variable \u03bd indexed by a continuous label x; therefore, in a more suggestive\nnotation, we temporarily write fx (\u03bd) \u2261 K\u03bd< (x) . While the collection of functions fx (\u03bd) are\ndefined in (3.10) on the negative \u03bd-axis R\u2212 (excluding the simple pole at zero), they can be\n8\n\nIn fact, Carlson's Theorem [12] can be used to uniquely extend a function defined only on the integers to\nthe whole complex plane. This is actually the theorem of most relevance here; however, as we shall see\nin Section IV B, in practice we can analytically continue a function defined on the integers without this\nTheorem. We appeal to Carlson's Theorem only to guarantee the uniqueness of this procedure.\n\n14\n\n\fanalytically continued to the complex \u03bd-plane C. Furthermore, the functions take the same\nalgebraic form on the complex plane, namely,\ni\n1 \u0010 x \u0011\u03bd h\nfx (\u03bd) = \u2212\n1 + \u03bd \u03b3 for \u03bd \u2208 C .\n(3.13)\n2\u03bd 2\nWe can now restrict our attention from C in general to the positive \u03bd-axis R+ (excluding\nzero). This allows us to directly compare K\u03bd< (x) and K\u03bd> (x) at \u03bd \u2208 R+ using the same\nalgebraic forms as given by (3.10) and (3.9). In the next section, we discuss the implications\nof analytically continuing K\u03bd< (x) from the negative axis \u03bd < 0 to the positive axis \u03bd > 0.\nAlternately, we could continue gx (\u03bd) \u2261 K\u03bd> (x) to the region \u03bd \u2208 R\u2212 using the same functional\n\nform as (3.9), and compare this with K\u03bd< (x).\n\nD.\n\nNext-to-Leading Order Term\n\nWe now illustrate the key mathematical result that allows dimensional continuation to\nextract not only the leading, but the next-to-leading order terms. Recall from (3.9) and (3.10)\nthat K\u03bd> (x) and K\u03bd< (x) are both leading order in x for \u03bd > 0 and \u03bd < 0, respectively. Since\nthese functions were calculated for mutually exclusive values of \u03bd, one might think that they\ncannot be compared. When viewed as an analytic function in the complex \u03bd-plane, however,\nwe have seen that K\u03bd< (x) is also a function over the domain \u03bd > 0, in which case both K\u03bd< (x)\nand K\u03bd> (x) can be compared at the same values of \u03bd and x. Since the algebraic form is so\nsimple, K\u03bd< (x) takes the same functional form when analytically continued to \u03bd > 0 as it did\nfor \u03bd < 0. As illustrated in Fig. 1, this means that K\u03bd< (x) becomes next-to-leading order in\nx along the positive real axis:\ni\n1 \u0010 x \u0011\u2212\u03bd h\n1 \u2212 \u03bd\u03b3\n2\u03bd 2\ni\n1 \u0010 x \u0011\u03bd h\nK\u03bd< (x) = \u2212\n1 + \u03bd\u03b3\n2\u03bd 2\nK\u03bd> (x) =\n\n: LO in x when \u03bd > 0\n\n(3.14)\n\n: NLO in x when \u03bd > 0 .\n\n(3.15)\n\nThe expressions (3.14) and (3.15) remain accurate to linear-order in \u03bd.\nTo see that (3.15) is indeed next-to-leading order in x relative to (3.14), note that the\nx-behavior of the leading order contribution for \u03bd > 0 can be written K\u03bd> (x) \u223c x\u2212|\u03bd| . I have\nused the absolute value |\u03bd| to emphasize that the power of x in (3.14) is strictly negative\n\nwhen \u03bd > 0. Similarly, along the positive \u03bd-axis we find the behavior K\u03bd< (x) \u223c x|\u03bd| for \u03bd > 0,\nand we see that x\u2212|\u03bd| \u226b x|\u03bd| for 0 < x \u226a 1. This means K\u03bd> (x) \u226b K\u03bd< (x) for \u03bd > 0 and\n0 < x \u226a 1, and we are therefore justified in calling K\u03bd> (x) leading order in x and K\u03bd< (x)\nnext-to-leading order.\n\n15\n\n\fanalytically continue\naround the \u03bd = 0 pole\n\n\u272c \u2729\n\nK\u03bd< (x)\n1\n\u2212 2\u03bd\n\n\u0001\nx \u03bd\n2\n\n[1 + \u03bd\u03b3]\n\u21d3\nx\u2212|\u03bd|\nLO: large when x \u226a 1\n\n\u2022\n0\n\n\u2744K < (x)\n\n\u2732 \u03bd\n\n\u03bd\n\n1\n\u2212 2\u03bd\n\n\u0001\nx \u03bd\n2\n\n[1 + \u03bd\u03b3]\n\n\u21d3\nx|\u03bd|\nNLO: small when x \u226a 1\n\nFIG. 1: The analytic continuation of K\u03bd< (x) from \u03bd \u2208 R\u2212 to \u03bd \u2208 R+ in the complex \u03bd-plane: the same\n\nexpression can be used for K\u03bd< (x) throughout the complex plane since the pole at \u03bd = 0 can easily be\navoided, as indicated in the figure. Note that K\u03bd< (x) \u223c x\u2212|\u03bd| is leading order in x for \u03bd < 0. However,\nupon analytically continuing K\u03bd< (x) to \u03bd > 0, the x-dependence becomes K\u03bd< (x) \u223c x|\u03bd| , and the function is\nnext-to-leading order relative to K\u03bd> (x) \u223c x\u2212|\u03bd| .\n\nStrictly speaking, we have only shown that K\u03bd< (x) is subleading relative to K\u03bd> (x) when\n\u03bd > 0. To conclude that K\u03bd< (x) \u223c x\u03bd is indeed next-to-leading order relative to K\u03bd> (x) \u223c x\u2212\u03bd ,\n\nit is important to establish that there are no powers of x between x\u03bd and x\u2212\u03bd in the expansion\nof K\u03bd (x). For \u03bd > 0, one simply subtracts (3.9) from (3.2), and it becomes clear that this\n\nerror is higher order in x than x\u03bd . For a more detailed proof of this, see footnote 2 of\nRef. [8]. A similar statement holds for K\u03bd> (x), namely, as we analytically continue from\n\u03bd > 0 to \u03bd < 0, the quantity K\u03bd> (x) switches from leading order to next-to-leading order\nin x relative to K\u03bd< (x).\n\nE.\n\nAssembling the Pieces\n\nWe have now assembled enough results to find K0 (x) to leading and next-to-leading order\nin x: we simply add the expressions (3.14) and (3.15) and take the limit of vanishing \u03bd. Note\nthat this does not lead to any form of \"double counting.\" Instead, we are simply adding\nthe next-to-leading order term (3.15) to the leading order term (3.14) at a common value\nof \u03bd > 0. Upon taking the limit of vanishing \u03bd, or more precisely \u03bd \u2192 0+ since \u03bd is always\npositive in (3.14) and (3.15), we obtain K0 (x) to leading and next-to-leading order in x.\nWe now calculate this limit, proving that\nh\ni\nlim+ K\u03bd> (x) + K\u03bd< (x) = \u2212 ln x + ln 2 \u2212 \u03b3 .\n\u03bd\u21920\n\n(3.16)\n\nLet us first expand (x/2)\u00b1\u03bd in powers of \u03bd. We will denote z = x/2, from which we find\nz \u00b1\u03bd = eln(z\n\n\u00b1\u03bd )\n\n= e\u00b1\u03bd ln z = 1 \u00b1 \u03bd ln z + O(\u03bd 2 ), or in summary:\nz \u00b1\u03bd = 1 \u00b1 \u03bd ln z + O(\u03bd 2 ) .\n16\n\n(3.17)\n\n\fThis allows us to express (3.14) and (3.15) as\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0010 x \u0011 \u0015\u0014\n1\n>\nK\u03bd (x) =\n1 \u2212 \u03bd ln\n1 \u2212 \u03bd\u03b3 + O(\u03bd) =\n2\u03bd\n2\n\n1\n1 \u0010x\u0011 \u03b3\n\u2212 + O(\u03bd) , (3.18)\n\u2212 ln\n2\u03bd 2\n2\n2\n\nand\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0010 x \u0011 \u0015\u0014\n1\n1\n1 \u0010x\u0011 \u03b3\n1 + \u03bd ln\n1 + \u03bd\u03b3 + O(\u03bd) = \u2212 \u2212 ln\n\u2212 + O(\u03bd). (3.19)\nK\u03bd (x) = \u2212\n2\u03bd\n2\n2\u03bd 2\n2\n2\n<\n\nWhen we divide (3.17) by a factor of \u03bd, as required by (3.14) and (3.15), note that we find:\n(i) a pole 1/\u03bd from the first term in (3.17), (ii) a non-analytic finite contribution \u00b1 ln z from\nthe second term, and (iii) the error in \u03bd becomes O(\u03bd), which is the same order in \u03bd that\nwe are neglecting in (3.14) and (3.15). The error in \u03bd, which vanishes in the limit \u03bd \u2192 0+ ,\nshould not be confused with the error in x, the latter being O(x2 ) for vanishing \u03bd. Note that\n\nthe pole terms cancel upon adding (3.18) and (3.19), so that\n\u0010x\u0011\nK\u03bd> (x) + K\u03bd< (x) = \u2212 ln\n\u2212 \u03b3 + O(\u03bd) ,\n2\n\n(3.20)\n\nthereby giving (3.16) as \u03bd \u2192 0+ . As we have discussed, there are no x-dependent terms that\nlie between K\u03bd> (x) \u223c x\u2212\u03bd and K\u03bd< (x) \u223c x\u03bd , so this procedure has captured the leading and\nnext-to-leading order behavior in x.\nIn exactly the same way, we can also calculate the leading order and next-to-leading order\ncontribution to K0 (x) by taking the limit from the left,\n\u0014\n\u0015\n<\n>\nlim\u2212 K\u03bd (x) + K\u03bd (x) = \u2212 ln x + ln 2 \u2212 \u03b3 .\n\u03bd\u21920\n\n(3.21)\n\nI should point out a potential notational problem in (3.16) and (3.21). Concentrating on\n(3.16) for the moment, the limit \u03bd \u2192 0+ indicates that both terms K\u03bd> and K\u03bd< are understood\nto live in dimensions \u03bd > 0, with the second term K\u03bd< having been analytically continued\nfrom \u03bd < 0. The notation with which the term K\u03bd< is written in (3.16), however, does not\nindicate that it has been analytically continued. This should be no cause for confusion,\nhowever, since K\u03bd< takes the same functional form in any dimension \u03bd; therefore, a separate\nnotation indicating that the K\u03bd< in (3.16) has been analytically continued is unnecessary. We\ncan simply add K\u03bd> and K\u03bd< as calculated in \u03bd > 0 and \u03bd < 0 respectively.\n\n17\n\n\fIV.\nA.\n1.\n\nDIMENSIONAL CONTINUATION\nRate of Energy Exchange as a Perturbative Expansion\nThe g-Expansion\n\nBefore moving on to the details of dimensional continuation, we must first discuss the\nplasma expansion parameter g. Since the problems in plasma physics are usually so complicated as to preclude a perturbative approach, most plasma physicists do not usually think in\nterms of expanding systematically in a small dimensionless parameter. However, for a weakly\nto moderately coupled plasma, it is a quite fruitful approach to perturbatively expand the\nrate in a small dimensionless coupling constant.\nThat such a universal parameter for a plasma exists was discussed at length in Ref. [13],\nwhere it was shown that any physical quantity associated with a plasma whose species are\nin equilibrium with themselves (such as the plasma we are studying) can be expanded in\ninteger powers of a dimensionless coupling constant g defined by\ng \u2261\n\nCoulomb Energy for Two Charges at Separation \u03bbD\n,\nTemperature in Energy Units\n\n(4.1)\n\nwith \u03bbD being the Debye length of the plasma. Since the potential energy between two like\ncharges is given by V = e2 /4\u03c0r in rationalized units, and writing the Debye wave number\nas \u03baD = \u03bb\u22121\nD , the coupling parameter is therefore\ne2 \u03baD\n.\ng =\n4\u03c0 T\n\n(4.2)\n\nFor a multicomponent plasma, there is actually a coupling constant for each pair of components,\ngab =\n\nea eb \u03bab\n,\n4\u03c0Tb\n\n(4.3)\n\nwith \u03bab defined by (1.4). However, when the pairs have approximately the same coupling\nstrength, then the single parameter (4.2) adequately characterizes the entire plasma. Expressing the charges as ea = Za e and eb = Zb e, we can write gab as\n1/2\n\ngab =\n\nZa Zb2\n\ne3 nb\n,\n4\u03c0 Tb3/2\n\n(4.4)\n\nand we see that the coupling constant is proportional to the cube of the electric charge, the\nsquare root of the density, and the inverse (3/2)-power of the temperature.\n18\n\n\fRecall that the usual plasma parameter \u0393 is defined in a similar manner to (4.1), except\nthat the charge separation is determined not by \u03bbD , but by the inter-particle spacing in the\nplasma,\n\u0393 \u2261\n\nCoulomb Energy for Two Charges at Inter-particle Separation d\n.\nTemperature in Energy Units\n\n(4.5)\n\nThe inter-particle spacing d is defined in several ways in the literature, but the idea is to\ntransform the plasma number density n into a length scale, so that d \u221d n\u22121/3 . The most\ncommon convention is to define d to be the radius of a sphere containing, on average, a single\nplasma particle, so that 4\u03c0 d3 /3 = 1/n, and therefore\ne2\n\u0393=\n4\u03c0T\n\n\u0012\n\u00131/3\n4\u03c0n\n.\n3\n\n(4.6)\n\nWith this convention, the relation between the two plasma coupling parameters for a single\nplasma species is \u03933 = g 2 /3, and for an arbitrary number of plasma species we always find\ng \u221d \u03933/2 . We can therefore use either g or \u0393 to characterize the strength of the plasma, as g\nand \u0393 become large or small together.9 For our purposes, however, there is an an advantage\nto using g rather than \u0393 since physical quantities are expanded as integer powers of g, while\nthey expand in fractional powers of \u0393.\n\n2.\n\nNext-to-Leading Order and the Coulomb Logarithm\n\nAs I have said, any plasma quantity can be written as a power series expansion in integer\npower of g, with the possible exception of non-analytic terms involving ln g. For the process of\nenergy exchange via Coulomb interactions, this non-analyticity arises from the competition\nbetween disparate physical length scales. As an expansion in g, the rate of energy exchange\ntakes the form\ndE\n= \u2212 A g 2 ln g + Bg 2 + O(g 3) .\n| {z } | {z }\ndt\nLO\n\n9\n\n(4.7)\n\nNLO\n\nThe dimensional continuation method requires that we perform calculations in an arbitrary spatial dimension \u03bd; however, the parameter g = e2 \u03baD /4\u03c0T as given by (4.2) is dimensionless (in the engineering\nsense) only in three spatial dimensions. As such, it is meaningless to call g large or small in any dimension\nother than \u03bd = 3. This is no cause for alarm, however, since in footnote 21, I will construct a dimensionless\ncoupling parameter g\u03bd in arbitrary spatial dimensions \u03bd. The parameter g\u03bd can then be used to characterize the plasma strength in \u03bd dimensions, and it will have the properties that (i) g\u03bd \u221d g and (ii) g\u03bd \u2192 g\nas \u03bd \u2192 3. Property (i) implies that a g\u03bd -expansion is the same as a g-expansion, and (ii) implies this\ncorrespondence continues down to three dimensions, where g becomes the relevant expansion parameter.\n\n19\n\n\fIn (4.7), I have indicated the leading order in g (LO) and the next-to-leading order in\ng (NLO) terms in the g-expansion: the first term is leading order relative to the second\nbecause |g 2 ln g| > g 2 for small g. The minus sign on the leading order term of (4.7) is a\nmatter of convention. Since the logarithm ln g will be negative in a weakly coupled plasma\n(recall g < 1), the minus sign renders the coefficient A positive when the energy exchange\nis positive. The coefficient A was first calculated by Spitzer. The coefficient B, however,\nis very difficult to calculate, and this was the main purpose of BPS [1]. It is convenient to\ndefine the dimensionless coefficient C by B = \u2212A ln C, in which case we can write\ndE\n= A g 2 ln \u039bcoul + O(g 3 ) , with ln \u039bcoul = \u2212 ln{Cg} .\ndt\n\n(4.8)\n\nWe see, then, that knowing the next-to-leading order term is equivalent to knowing the exact\ncoefficient C under the logarithm. Note that the minus sign renders the Coulomb logarithm\npositive when g is very small, in keeping with convention.\n\n3.\n\nFactors of g Inside the Coulomb Logarithm\n\nFor the heuristic model building of Section II A, let us pause for a moment and show that\nthe argument of the Coulomb logarithm in (2.1) is indeed proportional to g, as required by\n(4.8). On physical grounds we saw that the long-distance scale bmax is set by a Debye length,\nand therefore we nominally set bmax = \u03ba\u22121\n. In the extreme classical limit, the short-distance\nD\ncutoff bmin is set by the classical distance of closest approach rcl , so that bmin = c rcl . For\nsimplicity, we will choose the coefficient c such that K = A g 2 between (2.1) and (4.8), in\nwhich case\n\u001a\n\u001b\nbmax\nln \u039bcoul = ln\n.\n(4.9)\nbmin\nLet us consider two unit charges of mass m approaching one another with zero impact\nparameter. The rms speed of each particle is determined by\nr\n1\n3\n3T\n2\nm v\u0304 = T \u21d2 v\u0304 =\n,\n(4.10)\n2\n2\nm\nwhile energy conservation\n\n1\n2\n\nmv\u0304 2 + 12 mv\u0304 2 = e2 /4\u03c0rcl gives the distance of closest approach,\nrcl =\n\ne2\ne2 1\n=\n.\n4\u03c0 mv\u0304 2\n4\u03c0 3T\n\n(4.11)\n\nIn the extreme classical regime, we see that the argument of the Coulomb logarithm in (4.9)\nis indeed proportional to the plasma coupling constant,\nc e2 \u03baD\nc\nbmin\n= c rcl \u03baD =\n= g.\nbmax\n3 4\u03c0 T\n3\n20\n\n(4.12)\n\n\fLet us now look at the ad hoc interpolation (2.2) between the classical and quantum\nregimes. Up to this point I have said very little about quantum mechanics. While I will\nnot dwell on quantum corrections, I will briefly discuss a dimensionless expansion parameter\nthat characterizes the strength of the quantum two-body scattering correction. There are\nmany ways of defining such a parameter, but I will follow Ref. [13], taking\n\u03b7 \u2261\n\nClassical Distance of Closest Approach\n.\nThermal Wavelength\n\n(4.13)\n\nWith this definition, quantum corrections are large when \u03b7 \u226a 1. Motivated by the de Broglie\nwavelength of a particle, the thermal wavelength of a plasma species is given by rqm = ~/q\u0304,\nwhere q\u0304 = mv\u0304 is a typical momentum transfer suffered during a collision. Definition (4.13)\nyields \u03b7 = rcl /rqm = (e2 /4\u03c0mv\u0304 2 ) * (mv\u0304/~), or more succinctly\n\u03b7=\n\ne2\n,\n4\u03c0~ v\u0304\n\n(4.14)\n\nfrom which (2.2) gives\nc\nbmin\n=\nbmax\n3\n\n\u0012\n\u00131/2\n1\n1+ 2\ng.\n\u03b7\n\n(4.15)\n\nIn the extreme quantum limit in which \u03b7 \u226a 1, this becomes bmin /bmax = (c/3) (g/\u03b7).\nFinally, note that the factors inside the BPS Coulomb logarithm (1.3) are also proportional\nto the coupling constant g, and upon dropping the electron subscripts for convenience, we\nfind\n~2 \u03c9 2\n1 g2\n=\n.\nT2\n3 \u03b72\n\n(4.16)\n\nWe see that the g-dependence of the Coulomb logarithm arises quite naturally. However,\nthe accompanying coefficient under the logarithm might also possess \u03b7-dependence, thereby\nobscuring the g-dependence unless we are careful.\n\nB.\n\nMathematics of Dimensional Continuation\n\nBefore describing what dimensional continuation is, allow me to first state what it is not.\nDimensional continuation is not performing an integral to a fractional power of the spatial\ndimension, as with the meaningless expression\nZ \u221e\n3\nd 2 k f (k) .\n0\n\n21\n\n\fInstead, dimensional continuation is the following. Suppose some physical quantity of interest\ncan be written as an integral over a kernel\nZ\nQ(m) =\nd3 k f (k; m) ,\n(4.17)\nR3\n\nwhere f is determined by the physical equations of motion, whether classical or quantum.\nThe integrand is of course a function of the physical parameters, such as the masses and\ncharges of the fundamental particles, and I have abbreviated this dependence by the parameter m. For definiteness, we will think of k as a wave number with dimensions of an inverse\nlength. The laws of physics, from which (4.17) follows, are usually written in three dimensional space. Thus, we usually take k to be a three-dimensional vector, and we integrate k\nover the entire three-dimensional Euclidean space R3 .\nThe known fundamental laws of physics themselves, however, do not specify a particular spatial dimension in which they hold. In fact, as far as the known laws of physics are\nconcerned, the actual value \u03bd of the spatial dimension can be viewed as a free integer parameter: it is simply an unexplained empirical fact that we live in three dimensions.10 We can\ntherefore express any three-dimensional physical quantity or law, such as Newton's equation\nof motion or Gauss' law, in any number of integer dimensions \u03bd \u2208 Z+ . For example, we can\nwrite down a corresponding quantity to (4.17) in an arbitrary number of dimensions,\nZ\nQ(\u03bd; m) =\nd\u03bd k f\u03bd (k; m) ,\n(4.18)\nR\u03bd\n\nwhere the wave vector k is now a \u03bd-dimensional vector, and we integrate over the entire\n\u03bd-dimensional Euclidean space R\u03bd . I have placed a subscript on the integrand f\u03bd to indicate\nthat it is determined by the theory expressed in \u03bd dimensions. At this point, the spatial\ndimension is a non-negative integer, so that \u03bd = 1, 2, 3, 4, * * * . Since the integer \u03bd is arbitrary in (4.18), I have indicated that the corresponding quantity contains \u03bd-dependence by\nwriting Q(\u03bd; m); however, for notational simplicity I will drop the parametric dependence of\nquantities such as mass and simply write Q(\u03bd). A quantity that diverges in three-dimensions\nwill be finite in arbitrary \u03bd, but it will typically exhibit a simple pole of the form\nQ(\u03bd) =\n10\n\nQ0\n+ Q1 (\u03bd) ,\n\u03bd\u22123\n\n(4.19)\n\nOne would expect that the fundamental theory of nature, a theory of everything, would predict the number\nof space-time dimensions, solving this mystery at last. One of the great successes of string theory is that it\nis one of only two known theories that indeed predicts the number of space-time dimensions \u2013 the theory\nis inconsistent in all but nine space and one time dimensions. Accordingly, this is also one of the great\nfailures of string theory. The other theory is super-gravity, which is only consistent in eleven dimensions.\n\n22\n\n\fwhere Q1 (\u03bd) is finite at \u03bd = 3.11 Dimensional continuation is simply the act of treating Q(\u03bd)\nas a function of a complex argument \u03bd, after the integral (4.18) has been performed for all\npositive integer values of \u03bd. This is not an unfamiliar procedure, as the factorial function \u03bd!\nwith \u03bd \u2208 Z+ can be generalized to the gamma function \u0393(\u03bd + 1) in which \u03bd \u2208 C. Indeed,\ngiven any function Q(\u03bd) defined on the integers, with only mild restrictions placed on the\nfunction at large values of the argument, Carlson's Theorem [12] allows us to continue this\nfunction uniquely to the complex plane.\nHow does dimensional continuation work in practice? We will look at a few specific\nexamples in Sections IV C and VI, but for now let us consider a general physical quantity Q\nin which the integrand in (4.17) depends solely upon the modulus of k, so that\nZ\nQ = d3 k f (k) .\n(4.20)\nIn such a case it is not uncommon that the integrand in the generalization (4.18) is only a\nfunction of the modulus of the \u03bd-dimensional wave vector k, with the same functional form\nas the integrand in (4.20). In other words, in (4.18) we have f\u03bd (k) = f (k) with k = |k|,\nthereby allowing us to write\nZ\nQ(\u03bd) = d\u03bd k f (k) .\n(4.21)\nSince the integrand is a function only of k, we can extract the angular integrals and write\nZ \u221e\nZ\nk \u03bd\u22121 dk f (k) .\nQ(\u03bd) =\nd\u03a9\u03bd\u22121 *\n(4.22)\n0\n{z\n} |\n|\n{z\n}\n(\u03bd\u22121) integrals\n\none-dimensional integral\n\nAt this point, the dimension \u03bd is simply an arbitrary positive integer, \u03bd \u2208 Z+ . As we will\nshow in the next paragraph, the integration over all angles gives\nZ\n2\u03c0 \u03bd/2\n.\n(4.23)\n\u03a9\u03bd\u22121 \u2261 d\u03a9\u03bd\u22121 =\n\u0393(\u03bd/2)\nThis leaves a one-dimensional integral to perform, in which \u03bd simply acts as a parameter,\nZ \u221e\nF (\u03bd) \u2261\ndk k \u03bd\u22121 f (k) .\n(4.24)\n0\n\nThe physical quantity now becomes the product of (4.23) and (4.24) with \u03bd \u2208 Z+ . In the case\nof (4.23), we already know how to analytically continue \u03bd to complex values. On the other\n11\n\nAs we shall see in the next section, it is the nature of the Coulomb force that gives a pole in three\ndimensions, rather than some other value of the dimension. We shall further see that there is important\nphysics in the residue Q0 of the pole.\n\n23\n\n\fhand, for (4.24) we can think of \u03bd as being an arbitrary complex number when performing\nthe one-dimensional integral over k, and therefore we can regard F (\u03bd) as a function over the\ncomplex \u03bd-plane, thereby giving\nQ(\u03bd) =\n\n2\u03c0 \u03bd/2\nF (\u03bd)\n\u0393(\u03bd/2)\n\nwith \u03bd \u2208 C .\n\n(4.25)\n\nIn this manner, we can regard Q(\u03bd) as a function of a complex argument \u03bd, and by Carlson's\nTheorem [12], this is the unique continuation from positive integer values of \u03bd to complex\nvalues of \u03bd.\nAs an example of this procedure, let us prove (4.23). First, consider the one-dimensional\nGaussian integral\nZ \u221e\n\u221a\n2\n(4.26)\ndk e\u2212k = \u03c0 .\n\u2212\u221e\n\nIf we multiply both sides together \u03bd times (with \u03bd \u2208 Z+ ), we find\nZ \u221e\nZ \u221e\nZ \u221e\nZ\n\u221a \u03bd\n2\n\u2212k12\n\u2212k22\n\u2212k\u03bd2\n( \u03c0) =\ndk1 e\ndk2 e\n***\ndk\u03bd e\n= d\u03bd k e\u2212k ,\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n(4.27)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nwhere the wave vector k in the exponential of the last expression is the \u03bd-dimensional vector\nP\nk = (k1 , k2 , * * * , k\u03bd ), and k2 is the \u03bd-dimensional inner product k2 = \u03bdl=1 kl2 . As in (4.22),\nwe can factor the angular integrals out of the right-hand-side of (4.27), and the remaining\none-dimensional integral can be converted to a Gamma function with the change of variables\nt = k2 :\nZ\nZ\nZ\nZ \u221e\nZ\n1\n1 \u221e \u03bd/2\u22121 \u2212t\n\u03bd/2\n\u03bd\u22121 \u2212k 2\ndt t\ne = d\u03a9\u03bd\u22121 * \u0393(\u03bd/2) . (4.28)\n\u03c0 = d\u03a9\u03bd\u22121 * dk k\ne = d\u03a9\u03bd\u22121 *\n2 0\n2\n0\nR\nSolving for d\u03a9\u03bd\u22121 in (4.28) gives (4.23). As an aside, it is interesting to note that we have\nalso found the hyper-area of a (\u03bd \u22121)-dimensional sphere of radius r in R\u03bd ,\nA\u03bd =\n\n2 \u03c0 \u03bd/2 \u03bd\u22121\nr\n,\n\u0393(\u03bd/2)\n\n(4.29)\n\nand integrating (4.29) gives the hyper-volume of a \u03bd-dimensional ball of radius r,\n\u03a3\u03bd =\n\n\u03c0 \u03bd/2\nr\u03bd .\n\u0393(\u03bd/2 + 1)\n\n24\n\n(4.30)\n\n\fC.\n\nPhysics of Dimensional Continuation\n\nSo far we have only introduced dimensional continuation as a regularization prescription,\na means by which infinite theories can be rendered temporarily finite. This is the use to\nwhich dimensional continuation is commonly employed in field theory; however, this alone\nis not sufficient to render the method suitable for our purposes. Instead, there are also\nphysics reasons that make dimensional continuation applicable to the problem at hand. I\nwill now show that the Coulomb potential, and indeed physics in general, behaves differently\nin different spatial dimensions. In particular, short-distance or ultraviolet (UV) physics\ndominates when \u03bd > 3; while long-distance or infrared (IR) physics dominates when \u03bd < 3.\nIn \u03bd = 3 dimensions, both UV and IR physics are equally important.12 This means that\ndimensional continuation acts as a \"physics sieve,\" allowing us to capture the leading UV\nand IR physics simply by performing the relevant integrals in dimensions greater than or\nless than the traditional \u03bd = 3. In the next few paragraphs, we will discuss why changing\nthe dimension of space emphasizes either long- or short-distant physics. Understanding this\npoint is crucial for all that follows.\nWe now turn to finding the \u03bd-dimensional Coulomb potential, an exercise that succinctly\nillustrates how the physics of a system changes with the dimension of space. Besides illustrating that UV physics dominates in higher dimensions (and conversely), this example will\nalso clarify the manner by which one performs physical calculations in arbitrary dimensions.\nLet us consider Poisson's equation\n\u2207*E(x) = \u03c1(x) .\n\n(4.31)\n\nThere is nothing in this equation per se that restricts us to three dimensions.13 We choose\nto describe the electric field E and the spatial coordinate x as three-dimensional vectors because we live in three dimensions. However, from the mathematics alone, we could equally\nwell consider these vectors as living in an arbitrary \u03bd-dimensional space R\u03bd . The rectilinear coordinates would then become x = (x1 , x2 , * * * , x\u03bd ), with a similar expression for the\n\u03bd-dimensional electric field, while the gradient would be \u2207 = (\u2202/\u2202x1 , \u2202/\u2202x2 , * * * , \u2202/\u2202x\u03bd ).\nIt is convenient to write Poisson's equation in its integral representation, which will allow us\nto calculate the electric field of a point charge with relative ease. Consider a point-charge at\n12\n\n13\n\nThere are a number of such coincidences, both physical and mathematical, that suggest there is something\nspecial about living in three spatial dimensions and one time dimension. This could well be the Anthropic\nPrinciple at work.\nOne can most easily write\nP the complete set of Maxwell's equation in a general dimension by employing the\nLorentz covariant form \u03bd\u03b1=0 \u2202F \u03b1\u03b2 /\u2202x\u03b1 = j \u03b2 , where the electric and magnetic fields have been expressed\nin terms of the anti-symmetric field tensor F \u03b1\u03b2 .\n\n25\n\n\fthe origin given by \u03c1(x) = e \u03b4 (\u03bd) (x), and let \u03a3 be any volume containing the charge e. Then,\nin a general number of dimensions, we can integrate (4.31) to obtain\nZ\nd\u03bd x \u2207*E = e .\n(4.32)\n\u03a3\n\nNote that the dimensionality of space is now explicitly indicated by the integration measure.\nFor our purposes, the advantage of the integral representation of Poisson's equation is\nthat the electric field of a point charge in the \u03bd-dimensional space can easily be calculated\nby the same symmetry principles that hold in three dimensions. Suppose the volume \u03a3 is\na spherical ball Br of radius r centered on the charge. The boundary of Br is a sphere of\ndimension \u03bd\u22121 and will be denoted by \u2202Br (I am using the common notation \u2202 in differential\ngeometry for the boundary of a manifold). From rotational symmetry, the electric field E\nof a point charge is directed radially outward and lies normal to the surface \u2202Br at each\npoint. We will denote the magnitude of the electric field at radius r by E(r). Recall that\nin (4.29), we calculated the hyper-area of the (\u03bd \u2212 1)-sphere \u2202Br to be A\u03bd = \u03a9\u03bd\u22121 r \u03bd\u22121\nwith \u03a9\u03bd\u22121 = \u03c0 \u03bd/2 /\u0393(\u03bd/2). Since the divergence theorem holds in an arbitrary Euclidean\nspace (like the laws of physics, there is nothing in the divergence theorem to restrict the\ndimensionality of space to three), we can write\nI\nZ\n\u03bd\ndA*E = \u03a9\u03bd\u22121 r \u03bd\u22121 * E(r) .\n(4.33)\nd x \u2207*E =\ne=\nBr\n\n\u2202Br\n\nAt position x, the electric field therefore takes the form\nE(x) =\n\ne\nx\u0302 ,\n\u03a9\u03bd\u22121 r \u03bd\u22121\n\n(4.34)\n\nwhere I am using the notation x = r x\u0302, with x\u0302 being a unit vector pointing in the direction\nof x and r = |x| being the magnitude. It is often more convenient to work with the electric\npotential, a scalar quantity \u03c6\u03bd (r) defined by E(r) = \u2212d\u03c6\u03bd (r)/dr. In fact, we need the\npotential energy V\u03bd (r) = e \u03c6\u03bd (r), so that\nV\u03bd (r) =\n\n1 e2\n,\nC\u03bd r \u03bd\u22122\n\n(4.35)\n\nwith\nC\u03bd = \u03a9\u03bd\u22121 (\u03bd \u2212 2) =\n\n4\u03c0 \u03bd/2\n.\n\u0393(\u03bd/2 \u2212 1)\n\n(4.36)\n\nFor \u03bd = 3 we have C3 = 1/4\u03c0, which is the origin of the 4\u03c0 of rationalized units. Note\nfrom (4.35) that the engineering unit of electric charge is a function of the dimension \u03bd.\nThis is because the \u03bd-dimensional Coulomb potential (4.35) must have units of energy, and\n26\n\n\fFIG. 2: Short-distance or ultraviolet (UV) physics dominates in dimensions \u03bd > 3. Long-distance or infrared\n(IR) physics dominates when \u03bd < 3. UV and IR physics are equally important in \u03bd = 3.\n\nconsequently the engineering unit of e2 is Energy\u00d7(Length)\u03bd\u22122 = Mass\u00d7(Length)\u03bd /(Time)2 .\nIt is quite natural that a composite quantity, made from the fundamental units of Mass,\nLength and Time, change its engineering dimension with the dimension of space.\nFigure 2 shows the Coulomb potential for \u03bd = 3, along with two representative dimensions\non either side of \u03bd = 3. As the figure illustrates, the short-distance or UV behavior of\nthe Coulomb potential becomes more severe as the dimension increases above \u03bd = 3, while\nthe long-distance or IR behavior dominates for dimensions below \u03bd = 3. The arbitrary\nintegration constant for the potential energy has been adjusted in each case so that all three\ngraphs intersect at a single point. This was purely for aesthetics, as it renders the differences\nbetween the potentials more apparent. Despite the trouble we went through in the previous\nparagraph to find the coefficients C\u03bd , in this paragraph (and only in this paragraph) I\nhave temporarily set C\u03bd = 1. This will make it easier to compare the r-dependence of\nvarious potentials, and I would rather opt for clarity over notational consistency. For the\nrepresentative potential with dimension below \u03bd = 3, I chose to graph the one-dimensional\npotential V1 (r) = e2 r rather than the two-dimensional potential V2 (r) = e2 ln(r/r0), where r0\nis an arbitrary integration constant with units of length. In both cases the potential increases\nwithout bound at long distances, thereby illustrating the dominance of long-distance or IR\nphysics in dimensions less than three. However, I chose to graph V1 (r) rather than V2 (r)\nbecause the latter possesses a potentially misleading divergence as r \u2192 0: unlike the short-\n\ndistance or UV divergence associated with the potential in dimensions greater than three, the\n27\n\n\fprojectile\n\nvp\u2732\nt\n\n\u273b\n\nb\n\u03b8\u2701\n\u2022\u2701\neb\n\n\u2701\u2715 ep\n\u2701\n\n\u2701\n2\n2 2 1/2\n\u2701 r = (b + vp t )\n\nFIG. 3: A projectile of charge ep , mass mp , and velocity vp passing a fixed charge eb . The impact parameter b is normal to the velocity, so that b * vp = 0. The radial separation between the charges is\nr(t) = (b2 + vp2 t2 )1/2 , and only the b-component E\u22a5 = E cos \u03b8 = (b eb /\u03a9\u03bd\u22121 ) r\u2212\u03bd of the electric field contributes the impulse integration (4.40), where cos \u03b8 = b/r.\n\nr \u2192 0 divergence of V2 (r) is integrable, and consequently harmless. Therefore, for purposes\nof illustration, the potential V1 (r) = e2 r makes the point better than V2 (r) = e2 ln(r/r0 ).\nRemarkably, we now see that by simply selecting the dimension \u03bd, we can dial a potential\nV\u03bd (r) that filters either long-distance or short-distance physics.\nI would now like to show how the pole at \u03bd = 3 arises from the \u03bd-dimensional Coulomb\npotential. In the temperature equilibration process, individual plasma species exchange\nenergy by mutual Coulomb interactions. For example, consider a particle in the plasma with\ncharge ep , mass mp , and velocity vp , and suppose it passes another charge eb with an impact\nparameter b. This is illustrated in Fig. 3, where, to zeroth order, the projectile follows the\nstraight line x(t) = b + vp t as a function of the time t, with b * vp = 0.14 In \u03bd-dimensional\nspace, the Coulomb potential is given by (4.35), and the corresponding electric field E by\n(4.34), with e replaced by eb . The projectile therefore acquires a momentum transfer\nZ +\u221e\n\u2206p = ep\ndt E(b + vp t) ,\n(4.37)\n\u2212\u221e\n\nand it suffers a corresponding change in energy\n\u2206E =\n\n\u2206p2\n.\n2mp\n\n(4.38)\n\nThe component of the electric field along the direction of motion vp integrates to zero in\n(4.37), while the component normal to the trajectory gives the impulse\nZ\nZ +\u221e\nep eb +\u221e\ndt b (b2 + vp2 t2 )\u2212\u03bd/2 b\u0302\n(4.39)\n\u2206p = ep\ndt E\u22a5 (b + vp t) b\u0302 =\n\u03a9\n\u03bd\u22121 \u2212\u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n\u223c\n14\n\n1\nb\u03bd\u22122\n\nb\u0302 .\n\n(4.40)\n\nIn this simple example, I am not concerned with hyperbolic orbit corrections and the like; but rather, I\nam tracing the origin of the logarithmic divergence of the Coulomb potential and the pole at \u03bd = 3. For\nthis, we can work with a hot dilute plasma where a linear trajectory will suffice.\n\n28\n\n\fThe temperature equilibration rate contains a factor involving the cross-section weighted\nenergy transfer, and we see that the energy exchange between p and a can be written\nZ\nZ bmax\ndE\ndb\n\u223c d\u03c3 \u2206E \u223c\n,\n(4.41)\ndt\nb\u03bd\u22122\nbmin\nwhere we have used the fact that d\u03c3 * \u2206E \u223c b\u03bd\u22122 db * b\u22122(\u03bd\u22122) \u223c db/b\u03bd\u22122 . I will elaborate\nfurther on this example in the next lecture, but for now one should simply note that the rate\n(4.41) implies that large \u03bd is dominated by short-distance physics and small \u03bd is dominated by\nlong-distance physics. Moreover, expression (4.41) gives \u03bd = 3 as the dividing line between\nthese two regions. To see this, note that for \u03bd > 3 the impact parameter integral is not\nsensitive to the large distance cut off, and we may simply take the limit bmax \u2192 \u221e to obtain\nZ \u221e\ndb\nb3\u2212\u03bd\nmin\n\u03bd>3 :\n=\n\u21d2 UV dominant and pole at \u03bd = 3 .\n(4.42)\n\u03bd\u22122\nb\n\u03bd\n\u22123\nbmin\n\nConversely, for \u03bd < 3, we can set bmin = 0, with\nZ bmax\nb3\u2212\u03bd\ndb\nmax\n=\n\u21d2 IR dominant and pole at \u03bd = 3 .\n(4.43)\n\u03bd<3 :\n\u03bd\u22122\nb\n3\n\u2212\u03bd\n0\nThe results displayed are the dominant forms in the two regions of spatial dimensionality\nabout \u03bd = 3. In either case, the stopping power contains a pole 1/(\u03bd \u2212 3).\nThere are a number of important consequences arising from the UV and IR behaviors of\nthe Coulomb potential (4.35). I will discuss this more fully in Section VI A, but for now recall\nthat the derivation of the Boltzmann equation, as presented in Ref. [14] for example, breaks\ndown for the Coulomb potential in three spatial dimensions because of the aforementioned\ninfrared singularity. However, in \u03bd > 3 the \"textbook derivation\" of the Boltzmann equation\nwith the Coulomb potential (4.35) is finite and completely rigorous. The simple pole at \u03bd = 3\nin the scattering kernel corresponds to an IR divergence because of the long-range nature\nof the Coulomb force in three dimensions. Furthermore, because dimensions greater than\nthree enhance the UV physics, the classical Born, Bogoliubov, Green, Kirkwood, and Yvon\n(BBGKY) hierarchy reduces to the Boltzmann equation to leading order in g (or to leading\norder in the number density) when \u03bd > 3. A similar reduction from BBGKY holds for the\nLenard-Balescu equation in \u03bd < 3, and the \"textbook derivation\" [15] is also rigorous in\nthese dimensions. In \u03bd = 3, the derivations of the Boltzmann and Lenard-Balescu equations\nbreak down for the Coulomb potential. This is not because the \u03bd = 3 version of the BBGKY\nhierarchy is divergent, but because the truncation procedure that leads to the Boltzmann\nand Lenard-Balescu equations breaks down for the three dimensional Coulomb potential.15\nIndeed, BBGKY is completely finite for the Coulomb potential in \u03bd = 3, albeit completely\nuseless for our purposes. Section II of BPS [1] provides more details, especially the two\nparagraphs between Eqs. (2.7) and (2.8).\n15\n\nFor example, in deriving the Boltzmann equation from BBGKY, one invokes a principle of uncorrelated\n\n29\n\n\fV.\n\nTHE LAMB SHIFT AND THE COULOMB LOGARITHM\n\nThe Lamb shift is interesting for us because it provides another connection with the\nCoulomb logarithm, both in the historical details and in much of the physics. The Lamb\nshift is a small energy split in the otherwise degenerate 2S and 2P states of total angular\nmomentum j = 1/2. The measured value is about \u2206Elamb \u2243 4.4 \u00d7 10\u22126 eV, with the 2S1/2\nstate lying above the 2P1/2 state. Therefore, when an electron makes a transition from\nthe S-state to the P -state, it emits a microwave photon of frequency \u2206\u03bd lamb \u2243 1060 MHz.\nCalculating the observed value of the Lamb shift was the first great success of quantum\nelectrodynamics (QED), the relativistic quantum theory of light and matter.16\nDirac's relativistic model of the hydrogen atom, i.e. his relativistic theory of the electron\nin a Coulomb potential, made the prediction that the energy levels of the hydrogen atom\n(neglecting the hyperfine structure) depend only upon the principal quantum number n and\nthe total angular momentum j (the sum of the orbital momentum l and the spin s = 1/2\nof the electron). In particular, Dirac predicted that the 2S1/2 and 2P1/2 states should be\ndegenerate. At the 1947 Shelter Island conference in New York, W. Lamb and R. Retherford\nannounced the results of their highly sensitive experiment measuring the emission frequency\nof photons in a 2S-2P transition, thereby establishing the unequivocal experimental existence\nof the Lamb shift.17 While almost degenerate compared to the binding energy of the hydrogen\natom, today's accepted experimental splitting is [16]\n\u2206E lamb \u2261 E2S1/2 \u2212 E2P1/2 = 4.374898(7) \u00d7 10\u22126 eV\n\n(5.1)\n\n\u2206Elamb\n= 1057.845(9) MHz ,\nh\n\n(5.2)\n\n\u2206\u03bd lamb \u2261\n\nwhere Plank's constant in the form h = 4.135 667 33(10) \u00d7 10\u221215 eV-s is the conversion factor\nbetween energy and frequency. Hans Bethe had attended the Shelter Island conference, and\n\n16\n\n17\n\ncollisions to replace the two-point correlation function by the product of two one-point functions, and this\nleads to the infrared divergence. This means, of course, that it is the long-distance correlations themselves\nthat tame the IR divergence of the Boltzmann equation, correlations that are neglected by the truncation\nprocess. As a related point, this procedure imposes an implicit initial condition, thereby providing a\ndirection of time for the Boltzmann equation (and this occurs even for short-range potentials).\nThe other early success of QED, which followed soon after the Lamb shift, was calculating the magnetic\ndipole moment of the electron. It is customary to write the magnetic moment of the electron \u03bce in terms of\nthe Bohr magneton \u03bcB = e~/2me by introducing the dimensionless g-factor: \u03bce = ge \u03bcB . Using relativistic\nsingle-particle quantum mechanics, in 1928 Dirac predicted ge = 2 (exactly). In 1948 Schwinger used QED\nto calculate the radiative corrections, and he found ge /2 = 1 + \u03b1/2\u03c0 + O(\u03b12 ) = 1.0011614, which was in\nexcellent agreement with experiment. Today, the electron's magnetic dipole moment has been calculated\nto include \u03b14 terms, and is in agreement with experiment to 10 significant figures, the most accurately\nverified quantity in the history of physics.\nIn the 1930s, S. Pasternak analyzed experimental data suggesting that such an energy split might exist;\nhowever, the systematic error was as large as the energy splitting itself.\n\n30\n\n\fon the train ride back he performed the first calculation of the Lamb shift, finding the value\n\u2206\u03bd bethe = 1040 MHz. Bethe's calculation was recognized as being only a rough approximation, neglecting high energy relativistic effects, but its close agreement with experiment was\ncause for optimism.\nThe dominant contribution to the Lamb shift comes from the bound 2S and 2P electrons\nexchanging virtual photons with the atomic nucleus.18 These radiative corrections effectively\nsmear the point-like nature of the nucleus, thereby altering the atomic energy levels (the electron no longer \"sees\" a pure Coulomb potential). Any possible number of photon exchanges\nwith the nucleus are permitted, from a single high-energy photon (hard/UV physics) to many\nlow-energy photons (soft/IR physics), and this means there are two disparate but competing\nenergy scales in the problem. In a manner similar to the Coulomb energy-loss rate (2.1), the\nLamb shift takes the form\n\u001a\n\u001b\nEmax\n\u2206E lamb = K ln\n.\n(5.3)\nEmin\nThe UV scale is set by Emax \u223c me c2 = 511 keV and the IR scale Emin is set by the binding\nenergy of the hydrogen atom\n\u0012 2 \u00132\n1\n1\ne\nE0 =\nme = \u03b12 me c2 = 13.6 eV .\n(5.4)\n2 4\u03c0~\n2\nTo understand the origin of these scales, note that Emax takes its value from the energy\nat which relativistic effects for the electron become important (the rest-mass energy of the\nelectron), while Emin takes its value from the only low-energy scale in the problem (namely,\nthe binding energy of the atom). The soft photon IR interactions can be handled by nonrelativistic means, while the hard UV photons require a more complicated relativistic treatment.\nFor this reason, Bethe used the simpler nonrelativistic formalism, cutting his calculation off\nat the relativistic energy scale Emax \u223c me c2 at which his formalism broke down. This is\nakin to cutting the calculation of the energy exchange rate off at some small distance scale\nbmin . Bethe then concentrated on the low energy theory, which is analogous to looking at\nthe Lenard-Balescu equation in the rate calculation. Bethe found a logarithmic UV divergence, in the same way the Lenard-Balescu equation has a UV divergence, but he was able\nto regularize the infinity by applying a technique known as mass renormalization, thereby\nrendering his calculation finite. His calculation was completely rigorous at low energies, and\nBethe found the coefficient K and the low energy cutoff Emin , both exactly [17]:\nK=\n18\n\n\u03b13\nE0\n3\u03c0\n\nand Emin = A0 E0\n\nwith Emax \u223c me c2 .\n\n(5.5)\n\nThere are also several other subdominant mechanisms, such as the vacuum polarization of the photon\nand the anomalous magnetic dipole moment of the electron. These give, respectively, the contributions\nmag\nvac\n\u2206\u03bdlamb\n= \u221227 MHz and \u2206\u03bdlamb\n= +68 MHz.\n\n31\n\n\fThe binding energy E0 of the hydrogen atom is given by (5.4), and while I will not write\nit down, the coefficient A0 is rigorously defined in terms of sums of matrix elements of the\nvarious intermediate states. These matrix elements are sufficiently complicated that one can\nonly calculate them numerically, and to three significant figures Bethe found A0 = 17.8.\nBethe's exact calculation of Emin is akin to an exact calculation of bmax in the rate problem.\nThis, however, is a point where the analogy is not precise: Bethe was able to exactly calculate\nEmin through the regularization procedure of mass renormalization, which has no counterpart\nin plasma physics. On the other hand, Lyman Spitzer was only able to estimate the value\nof the maximum impact parameter in the Coulomb logarithm to be of order bmax \u223c \u03ba\u22121\nD .\nBethe was able to perform this feat because QED is a fundamental theory of nature, while\nthe Boltzmann equation is not. Using (5.4), we can express (5.3) as\n\u2206E Blamb = \u2212\n\np\n\u03b15\nme c2 ln{CB * \u03b1} with CB = 17.8/2 = 2.98 ,\n3\u03c0\n\n(5.6)\n\nwhere \u03b1 = e2 /4\u03c0~c = 1/137.036 is the fine structure constant. Bethe's calculation therefore\nB\nB\ngives \u2206Elamb\n= 4.3 \u00d7 10\u22126 eV or \u2206\u03bdlamb\n= 1040 MHz.\n\nBethe did not, however, calculate the exact coefficient under the logarithm. Since his calculation broke down at relativistic energies, he used the somewhat ad hoc value Emax = me c2\n(rather than some multiple thereof) for the UV cutoff. It turns out that the high energy\ncorrections to (5.6) are rather small, so Bethe's result was perhaps more accurate than warranted. Since Bethe only estimated the maximum energy cutoff, his result (5.6) is only\naccurate to leading order in \u03b1, and the constant under the logarithm required a more accurate treatment. The analogy further continues: Bethe calculated the Lamb shift to leading\norder, just as Spitzer calculated the Coulomb logarithm to leading order. Both calculations\nfound the correct coefficient in front of the logarithm, and the order of magnitude of the\nargument of the logarithm. These calculations failed to extract the exact constant under the\nlogarithm, although Bethe managed to find the exact expression for the low-energy cutoff.\nIn this sense, Bethe is the Spitzer of the Lamb shift.\nShortly after this, R. Feynman and J. Schwinger independently calculated the high energy\ncontribution using their respective relativistically covariant formalisms,19 and their calcula-\n\ntions were exact to leading and next-to-leading order in \u03b1. After adding their contribution\nof the high energy corrections to Bethe's low energy form, the calculation of the Lamb shift\nwas complete and the constant under the logarithm was fully determined. Or so it would\n19\n\nF. Dyson soon proved that Schwinger's mathematically rigorous formalism was equivalent to Feynman's\nmore intuitive but easier to use approach. Along with the Japanese physicist S. Tomonaga, Schwinger\nand Feynman shared the 1965 Nobel prize \"for their fundamental work in quantum electrodynamics, with\ndeep-ploughing consequences for the physics of elementary particles.\"\n\n32\n\n\fseem. Simultaneously, J. French and V. Weisskopf completed an independent calculation of\nthe Lamb shift that disagreed with Feynman-Schwinger, albeit only slightly in the coefficient\nunder the logarithm. The plot thickened as yet another calculation of the Lamb shift was\ncompleted that agreed with French-Weisskopf, this time from N. Kroll and Lamb himself.20\nSo now we seem to have a real problem: the Schwinger-Feynman calculations agree with\neach other, but disagree with the French-Weisskopf and Kroll-Lamb calculations. Schwinger\nand Feynman had developed independent but equivalent formalisms that manifestly exhibited the relativistic covariance of the theory, while the other four had used a cumbersome\nformalism developed in the 1930's (now called old-fashioned perturbation theory). As it turns\nout, Schwinger and Feynman had made the same subtle mistake, and Weisskopf's calculation\nwas correct. The contribution to the Lamb shift we have been considering has the form\n\u001b\n\u0013\n\u0012 \u001a\n\u03b13\n91\nme c2\n\u2206Elamb =\n+\n,\n(5.7)\nE0 ln\n3\u03c0\n2EB\n120\nwhere E B = 17.8E0 is Bethe's low energy result (5.5). As with the BPS Coulomb logarithm,\nwe can bring the additive constant in (5.7) inside the logarithm, and using (5.4) we can\nexpress (5.7) as\n\u2206Elamb = \u2212\n\n\u03b15\nme c2 ln{C \u03b1} with C = 2.98 .\n3\u03c0\n\n(5.8)\n\nIn terms of the Bethe's coefficient CB of (5.6), the complete Lamb shift coefficient is\n\u221a\nC = 2 e\u221291/240 CB (apart from the photon vacuum polarization and the electron dipole\nmoment corrections, which were mentioned in footnote 18, but will not concern us further).\nFrench spent the next year tracing down the origins of the discrepancy between the\ncalculations. He could not find an error in the Feynman-Schwinger high energy calculation,\nnor was there an error in Bethe's low energy calculation. Instead, the error was in the way\nthe high-energy calculation of Feynman-Schwinger was \"joined\" onto the low-energy result\nof Bethe. The high-energy calculation is also infinite and in need of regularization, but this\ntime it contains an IR divergence. This is analogous to the Boltzmann equation containing\nthe correct short-distance physics, but nonetheless diverging at long distances. Therefore,\nFeynman-Schwinger had to introduce an intermediate step in which they regulated their high\nenergy theories in the infrared. They chose to do this by assigning a small mass to the photon,\nand then taking this mass to zero at the end of the calculation. While this is a common IR\nregularization scheme in QED, it is incommensurate with Bethe's regularization scheme in\nhis low energy calculation, where he used a simple cutoff procedure in a high-energy integral.\n20\n\nLamb was both an experimentalist and a theorist, and he received the 1955 Nobel Prize for his \"discoveries\nconcerning the fine structure of the hydrogen spectrum.\"\n\n33\n\n\fFrench-Weisskopf and Kroll-Lamb had gotten the correct result because they calculated both\nthe low-energy and the high-energy contributions using the same formalism, and therefore\nwith consistent regularization schemes for both short and long distances. For more on\nthe consequences of regulating large and small scales in an incommensurate manner, see\nFeynamn's footnote 13 in Ref. [18] of this lecture, which I have quoted in the bibliography in\nits entirety. That one must calculate the large and small scales in exactly the same manner\nis not a minor point, as underscored by the stature of the physicists who failed to realize\nits importance when they first calculated the Lamb shift from the then fledgling theory of\nquantum electrodynamics (QED).\nThere are a number of consistent regularization schemes in use today in QED and other\nfield theories of nature, with dimensional regularization being one of the most popular and\neasy to use. These regularization and renormalization schemes have allowed us to calculate\na great many experimentally verified quantities, to extremely high precision, and there is no\nlonger any doubt in their correctness. While extending the dimension of space to complex\nvalues might at first seem unsettling, this procedure works. When dimensional continuation was first introduced into quantum field theory, there were strong reactions against\nit. However, calculations performed with this method agree with calculations using other\nregularization schemes, and more important, with experiment. In time, particle physicists\nlearned to accept the notion that one can perform correct three dimensional calculations by\nworking in arbitrary complex dimensions. For our concerns, we note that Refs. [8] and [16]\nhave indeed calculated the Lamb shift using the method of dimensional continuation. The\nproblem of Feynman-Schwinger is avoided, and dimensional continuation gives the correct\nexperimentally observed result with much less effort than more traditional methods. As the\nabove discussion illustrates, this is no small achievement.\nIn summary, dimensional continuation is powerful because (i) it is a consistent regularization scheme that (ii) lends itself to a perturbative analysis, and (iii) requires relatively simple\n(or at least easily learned) calculational tools. DeWitt's calculation [7] was certainly consistent, in that it matched the long and short-distance physics commensurately [to order O(g 3 )].\nThis is because he starts with a finite regulated theory that treats long- and short-physics\ntogether within a single framework, albeit with a regularization scheme that does not lend\nitself to a systematic perturbative analysis. By comparison with the BPS result, we know\nDeWitt was accurate to order g 2, inclusive. But, as illustrated by Feynman's footnote 13 of\nRef. [18], and by the story of the Lamb shift above, any attempt at treating the long- and\nshort-distance physics by separate regularization schemes (as much of the plasma literature\ncurrently does), will likely miss the very constants they are trying to calculate. Recall, it\ntook two correct calculations to find the error in Feynman's single calculation. Dimensional\ncontinuation performs all necessary book keeping, at both small and large scales, and in a\nmanner that affords simple calculations and perturbative expansions.\n34\n\n\fVI.\n\nCALCULATING THE RATE SYSTEMATICALLY WITH DIMENSIONAL\n\nCONTINUATION\nA.\n\nDimensional Reduction of BBGKY\n\nLet us return to the rate equation (1.7) in the light of the apparatus of dimensional\ncontinuation that we have constructed. Since we are interested in spatially uniform plasmas, we will only consider particle distributions that are functions of the momentum, or\nequivalently the velocity. Let v\u03bd denote a \u03bd-dimensional velocity vector with components vl\nfor l = 1, * * * , \u03bd, and define a \u03bd-dimensional distribution function f\u03bd (v\u03bd , t) by\nd\u03bd v f\u03bd (v\u03bd , t) \u2261 number of particles in a hyper-volume d\u03bd v about v\u03bd at time t .\n\n(6.1)\n\nThen the generalization of the three dimensional result (1.7) to \u03bd-dimensions would be\nZ\ndE\u03bd\n1\n\u2202f\u03bd\n= d\u03bd v m v\u03bd2\n(v\u03bd , t) ,\n(6.2)\ndt\n2\n\u2202t\nP\nwhere the square of the velocity in (6.2) is v\u03bd2 = v\u03bd * v\u03bd = \u03bdl=1 vl2 . As previously mentioned, the standard textbook calculation of the Boltzmann equation goes through without\nan infrared divergent scattering kernel when \u03bd > 3. For now, I will write this equation in\nschematic form as\n\u2202f\u03bd\n+ v\u03bd *\u2207f\u03bd = B\u03bd [f ]\n\u2202t\n\n: \u03bd>3.\n\n(6.3)\n\nP\u03bd\n\nvl \u2202f\u03bd /\u2202xl . In dimensions\n\n:\u03bd<3.\n\n(6.4)\n\nNote that \u2207 is the \u03bd-dimensional gradient and v\u03bd *\u2207f\u03bd =\n\nl=1\n\n\u03bd < 3, the Lenard-Balescu equation is ultraviolet finite, and we have\n\u2202f\u03bd\n+ v\u03bd *\u2207f\u03bd = L\u03bd [f ]\n\u2202t\n\nThe explicit form of the scattering kernels B\u03bd [f ] and L\u03bd [f ] will not be required until the\nnext lecture. As we shall see, the scattering kernels B\u03bd and L\u03bd are simply the obvious generalizations of their three dimensional counter parts: momentum and wave-number vectors\nlive in \u03bd-dimensions, and the scattering is produced by the \u03bd-dimensional Coulomb potential\n(4.35). Calculations using (6.3) in \u03bd > 3 and (6.4) in \u03bd < 3, respectively, are completely\nfinite.\nIn exactly the same manner, one can generalize the BBGKY hierarchy to an arbitrary\nnumber of dimensions, and this will be the starting point for my treatment of dimensional\ncontinuation. As we discussed in the closing paragraph of the last section, when the number\nof spatial dimensions is greater than three, BBGKY reduces to the Boltzmann equation (6.3)\n35\n\n\f\u272c\n\nBBGKY\n\n(arbitrary \u03bd)\n\n\u272c\n\n\u272b\n\n\u03bd <3\n\n\u2720 \u2729\n\nLenard-Balescu\nEquation (LBE)\n\n\u272b\n\n\u272a\u2744\n\u2724\n\n\u03bd =3\n\nBreakdown\n\n\u2723\n\n\u2729\n\u272a\n\u2745 \u03bd >3\n\u2745\n\u2758\n\u2745\n\u272c\n\n\u2729\n\n\u272b\n\n\u272a\n\nBoltzmann\nEquation (BE)\n\n\u271c\n\n\u2722\n\nFIG. 4: For \u03bd > 3 the \"textbook derivation\" of the Boltzmann equation for a Coulomb potential is rigorous;\nfurthermore, the BBGKY hierarchy reduces to the Boltzmann equation to leading order in g. A similar\nreduction from the BBGKY hierarchy holds for the Lenard-Balescu equation in \u03bd < 3, and the \"textbook\nderivation\" is also rigorous in these dimensions. In \u03bd = 3, the derivations of the Boltzmann and LenardBalescu equations break down for the Coulomb potential. This is not because the three dimensional BBGKY\nhierarchy breaks down, but because the Boltzmann and Lenard-Balescu equations break down. Indeed,\nBBGKY is completely finite for the Coulomb potential in \u03bd = 3, albeit completely useless for our purposes.\n\nto leading order in the plasma coupling g.

The \"greater-than\" and \"less-than\" superscripts are to remind\nus that the integrals in the rate calculations (6.5) and (6.6) are to be preformed in \u03bd > 3 and\n\u03bd < 3, respectively. Because of spatial uniformity, I have set the convective terms in (6.3)\nand (6.4) to zero, v\u03bd *\u2207f\u03bd = 0. Using the appropriate Coulomb potential (4.35) for V\u03bd (r) in\nthe scattering kernels of (6.5) and (6.6), the integrals now converge, and they are calculated\nexactly in Sections 7 and 8 of BPS [1]. In the next lecture, we will calculate these integrals\nin the Born approximation.\nNote that this is a first-principles derivation of the rates (6.5) and (6.6) in their respective\ndimensions \u03bd. Let me reiterate the argument once again, although with a slightly different\n36\n\n\femphasis. For simplicity, we consider the purely classical regime first, adding quantum mechanics in a moment. The classical BBGKY hierarchy for the Coulomb potential in three\nspatial dimensions is well defined and finite. We run into trouble only when we attempt\nto truncate the hierarchy and derive lower-order kinetic equations, such as the Boltzmann\nand the Lenard-Balescu equations. The necessity of truncated equations is of course clear\n(even the three-body problem cannot be solved analytically). Unfortunately, however, the\nCoulomb potential in three dimensions produces divergent scattering kernels in these truncated equations. Rather than creating a model of the ostensibly divergent scattering kernel,\nwe shall instead systematically regulate the divergences by letting the spatial dimension\ndepart from its empirically measured value of three. Logarithmic divergences in three dimensions then become simple poles of the form 1/(\u03bd \u2212 3) in arbitrary dimensions. As with\n\nthe regularization procedure of quantum field theory, our starting point here is a well-defined\nand finite theory, albeit in \u03bd dimensions, regularized in a consistent fashion at all length and\nenergy scales.\nLet us now return to classical BBGKY, but this time in a spatial dimension \u03bd of arbitrary\npositive integer value (we are not yet considering continuous values of \u03bd). At first sight, the\nhierarchy equations in \u03bd dimensions are just as useless as those in three dimensions - there\nare simply too many of them to solve. However, if we are willing to work to leading order accuracy in the plasma coupling g, which is quite accurate for a weakly to moderately coupled\nplasma, then: (i) in \u03bd > 3 we can truncate BBGKY to the \u03bd-dimensional Boltzmann equation, and (ii) in \u03bd < 3 we can truncate BBGKY to the \u03bd-dimensional Lenard-Balescu equation. Quantum scattering effects in the plasma will not modify the \u03bd-dimensional LenardBalescu equation, but they will modify the \u03bd-dimensional Boltzmann equation. Since we\nrequire the leading order term in the rate to be exact, we must include two-body quantum\nscattering effects exactly (but no more than two-body effects, since these are subleading\nin g - in fact, three-body and higher correlations and scattering effects, both classical and\nquantum, can and should be neglected to leading order in g). Two-body quantum effects\ncan be accounted for by replacing the classical cross section in the Boltzmann scattering\nkernel with the the two-body quantum cross section (this can be performed exactly since all\n\nscattering phase shifts \u03b4l are known for the Coulomb potential in three dimensions). These\nideas will be illustrated in complete detail in the next lecture for a particularly useful but\nsimple case.\n\n37\n\n\fB.\n\nCalculating the Leading Order Term\n\nWe now return specifically to the electron-ion temperature equilibration rate of (1.2). To\nobtain the leading order in g behavior when \u03bd > 3, we calculate the rate using (6.5). As\nour calculation in the next lecture will reveal, this rate is proportional to g 2 (or the number\ndensity) and takes the form21\ndEe>I\ng2\n= H(\u03bd; \u03b7)\n+ O(\u03bd \u2212 3) : LO in g when \u03bd > 3 ,\ndt\n\u03bd\u22123\n\n(6.7)\n\nwhere, for definiteness, we have restored the electron-ion subscript to the rate, as in (1.1).\nIn the next lecture we shall calculate H(\u03bd; \u03b7) explicitly, but for now it will suffice to note\nthat H depends upon the spatial dimension \u03bd and the quantum parameter \u03b7. The simple\npole at \u03bd = 3 reflects the long-distance or infrared divergence of the Coulomb potential in\nthree spatial dimensions, and it arises from an integral over the radial coordinate of the\n\u03bd-dimensional Coulomb potential (4.35). In a similar manner, the leading order behavior in\ndimensions \u03bd < 3 is given by (6.6). In the next lecture, we will see that this takes the form\ndEe<I\ng \u03bd\u22121\n= G(\u03bd)\n+ O(3 \u2212 \u03bd) : LO in g when \u03bd < 3 .\ndt\n3\u2212\u03bd\n\n(6.8)\n\nThere is no \u03b7-dependence in G(\u03bd) since the leading order long-distance physics is purely\nclassical. In the next lecture, we will preform the integrals to establish (6.7) and (6.8),\nthereby calculating the coefficients H(\u03bd) and G(\u03bd) exactly (for notational simplicity, I will\nhereafter drop the \u03b7-dependence from H). Note that (6.8) also contains a simple pole at\n\u03bd = 3 arising from an integration of (4.35), but this time the pole corresponds to missing\nshort-distance physics or the ultraviolet divergence of the Lenard-Balescu equation in three\ndimensions. In general, if a three-dimensional integral diverges, then the corresponding\n\u03bd-dimensional integral will typically contain a simple pole of the form 1/(\u03bd \u2212 3). In this way\nwe can transform a divergent integral into a convergent quantity that we can manipulate,\nand this is how we shall regularize the divergent Boltzmann and Lenard-Balescu equations\nin three dimensions.\n21\n\nAs we have already pointed out in footnote 9, the parameter g = e2 \u03baD /4\u03c0T given by (4.2) is dimensionless\nonly for \u03bd = 3. From definition (4.1) and the Coulomb potential (4.35), the proper dimensionless expansion\n\u03bd\u22122\n\u03bd\u22123\nparameter should be g\u03bd = e2 \u03baD\n/C\u03bd T . However, since g\u03bd = g * \u03baD\n(4\u03c0/C\u03bd ), we can absorb factors\n\u03bd\u22123\nof \u03baD (4\u03c0/C\u03bd ) into any accompanying coefficient, such as H(\u03bd; \u03b7) in (6.7). Therefore, powers of the\ndimensionless coupling g\u03bd also count powers of the three dimensional coupling g. We are therefore free to\nthink of the expansion, even in \u03bd dimensions, in terms of the three dimensional parameter g.\n\n38\n\n\fanalytically continue\naround the \u03bd = 3 pole\n\n\u272c \u2729\n\ndEe<I /dt\n\n\u2022\n3\n\ng2\u2212(3\u2212\u03bd)\n\u21d3\n\ng2\u2212|\u03bd\u22123|\nLO: large when g \u226a 1\n\n\u2744dE < /dt\n\n\u2732 \u03bd\n\neI\n\ng2\u2212(3\u2212\u03bd)\n\n=\n\ng2+(\u03bd\u22123)\n\n\u21d3\ng 2+|\u03bd\u22123|\nNLO: small when g \u226a 1\n\nFIG. 5: The analytic continuation of dEe<I /dt from \u03bd < 3 to the region \u03bd > 3: the same expression can be\nused for dEe<I /dt throughout the complex plane since the pole at \u03bd = 3 can easily be avoided. Note that the\nquantity dEe<I /dt \u223c g 2+(\u03bd\u22123) is leading order in g for \u03bd < 3. However, upon analytically continuing to \u03bd > 3\nwe find that dEe<I /dt \u223c g 2+|\u03bd\u22123| , which is next-to-leading order in g relative to dEe>I /dt \u223c g 2 .\n\nC.\n\nNext-to-Leading Order from Leading Order via Analytic Continuation\n\nSince the rates dEe>I /dt of (6.7) and dEe<I /dt of (6.8) were calculated in mutually exclusive\ndimensional regimes, one might think that they cannot be compared. However, even though\n(6.8) was originally calculated in \u03bd < 3 for integer values of \u03bd, we can analytically continue\nthe result to complex values of \u03bd (in the same way that the factorial function, which operates\non positive integers, can be generalized to the Gamma function, which operates on the whole\ncomplex plane). In fact, if we continue dEe<I /dt to real values of \u03bd with \u03bd > 3, then we can\ndirectly compare (6.7) and (6.8). Upon writing the g-dependence of (6.8) as g 2+(\u03bd\u22123) , when\n\u03bd > 3 we see that (6.8) is higher order in g than (6.7). By power counting arguments, there\nare no powers of g in (6.7) between g 2 and g \u03bd\u22121 for \u03bd > 3, and therefore (6.8) indeed provides\nthe correct next-to-leading order term in g when the dimension is analytically continued to\n\u03bd > 3,\ng 2+(\u03bd\u22123)\ndEe<I\n= \u2212G(\u03bd)\n+ O(\u03bd \u2212 3) : NLO in g when \u03bd > 3 ,\ndt\n\u03bd\u22123\n\n(6.9)\n\nwhere I have written the exponent of g as 2 + (\u03bd \u22123) rather than \u03bd \u2212 1. This is illustrated\n\nin Fig. 5.\nAs we shall see in the next section, the individual pole-terms in (6.7) and (6.9) will cancel\ngiving a finite result when the leading and next-to-leading order terms are added. The\nresulting finite quantity will therefore be accurate to leading and next-to-leading order in\ng as the \u03bd \u2192 3 limit is taken. Alternately, we could have analytically continued (6.7) to\n\ndimensions \u03bd < 3, where it would become next-to-leading order relative to (6.8). In either\ncase, the leading and next-to-leading order contribution can be found by simply adding (6.7)\nand (6.8) and then taking \u03bd \u2192 3.\n39\n\n\fD.\n\nReturning to Three Dimensions\n\nTo find the three dimensional rate dEeI/dt, accurate to leading and next-to-leading order\nin the plasma coupling g, we add the leading order expression (6.7) for dEe>I /dt to the nextto-leading order expression (6.9) for dEe<I /dt, and then take the limit \u03bd \u2192 3+ :\n\u0014 >\n\u0015\ndEeI\ndEeI dEe<I\n+ O(g 3 ) .\n(6.10)\n= lim+\n+\n\u03bd\u21923\ndt\ndt\ndt\nFor the same reasons as given in Section III E, this does not lead to any form of \"double\ncounting.\" Instead, we are simply adding the next-to-leading order term (6.9) to the leading\norder term (6.7) at a common value of \u03bd > 3.\nSince (6.10) lies at the heart of dimensional continuation, allow me review the reasoning\nbehind this expression one final time. Recall from (6.7) and (6.8) that dEe>I /dt and dEe<I /dt\nare both leading order in g for \u03bd > 3 and \u03bd < 3, respectively. Since these functions were\ncalculated for mutually exclusive values of \u03bd, they must be analytically continued to the\nsame value of \u03bd for purposes of comparison. In equation (6.10), we have chosen to continue\ndEe<I /dt to \u03bd > 3, which takes the same algebraic form as it did for \u03bd < 3. The analytic\ncontinuation has the effect of rendering dEe<I /dt subleading in g relative to dEe>I /dt. There\nare no powers of g between these two terms for any value of \u03bd, and therefore the limiting\nprocedure \u03bd \u2192 3+ gives the three dimensional rate exactly to leading and next-to-leading\norder accuracy in g. We have therefore found the leading order and next-to-leading order in\ng contributions for \u03bd > 3,\ni\n1 h\ndEe>I dEe<I\n(6.11)\nH(\u03bd) g 2 \u2212 G(\u03bd) g 2+(\u03bd\u22123) + O(\u03bd \u2212 3) .\n+\n=\ndt\ndt\n\u03bd\u22123\nI have not indicated the higher order error in g, but instead I am emphasizing here the\nerror associated with the \u03bd-expansion. That is to say, (6.11) contains an implicit error that\napproaches O(g 3 ) as \u03bd \u2192 3+ , while I have chosen to explicitly display the first-order error\nin \u03bd \u2212 3. In the sum (6.11), the error in g remains nonzero in the three dimensional limit,\nwhile the \u03bd-error in (6.11) vanishes as \u03bd \u2192 3.\nIn taking the \u03bd \u2192 3 limit, we must keep in mind that terms proportional to \u03bd \u22123 will\ngive a non-vanishing result when multiplied by the pole 1/(\u03bd \u2212 3). Upon expanding the\ng-dependence to linear order in \u01eb = \u03bd \u22123 we find\ng \u01eb = exp{ ln(g \u01eb )} = exp{\u01eb ln g} = 1 + \u01eb ln g + O(\u01eb)2 ,\n\n(6.12)\n\nwhich can be written as\n1\ng\u01eb\n= + ln g + O(\u01eb) .\n\u01eb\n\u01eb\n40\n\n(6.13)\n\n\fWe must now expand the coefficients H(\u03bd) and G(\u03bd) in powers of \u01eb = \u03bd \u2212 3. As we shall\nsee in the next lecture, and this is a crucial point, the leading order in \u01eb terms are identical,\nand so the expansions take the form\nH(\u03bd) = \u2212A + \u01eb H1 + O(\u01eb2 )\n\n(6.14)\n\nG(\u03bd) = \u2212A + \u01eb G1 + O(\u01eb2 ) .\n\n(6.15)\n\nIn the next lecture, we will perform the integrals in (6.5) and (6.6), thereby allowing us\nto exactly compute A \u2261 H(\u03bd = 3) = G(\u03bd = 3) and the linear terms H1 \u2261 H \u2032 (\u03bd = 3) and\nG1 \u2261 G\u2032 (\u03bd = 3). The remaining procedure is now straightforward. Upon using (6.13)\u2013(6.15)\nin (6.7) and (6.9), the leading and next-to-leading order terms in g now take the form\ndEe>I\nA\n= \u2212\ng 2 + H1 g 2 + O(\u03bd \u2212 3; g 3)\ndt\n\u03bd\u22123\n\ndEe<I\n=\ndt\n\nA\ng 2 \u2212 A g 2 ln g \u2212 G1 g 2 + O(\u03bd \u2212 3; g 3) .\n\u03bd\u22123\n\n(6.16)\n(6.17)\n\nI have now indicated here the error associated with the g-expansion. Because the leading\norder terms in (6.14) and (6.15) are equal, the simple poles in (6.16) and (6.17) cancel.\nTherefore, the limit \u03bd \u2192 3+ of expression (6.11) gives the rate\ndEeI\n= \u2212A g 2 ln g + B g 2 + O(g 3 ) ,\ndt\n\n(6.18)\n\nwith B = H1 \u2212 G2 , in agreement with (4.7). In this way, BPS has calculated the energy\nexchange accurate to leading order and next-to-leading order in g.\n\nVII.\nA.\n\nSOME CLOSING REMARKS\nSummary\n\nI hope this account of the simple field theoretic apparatus necessary for a reading of BPS\nhas been helpful. Having understood the reasoning behind BPS, especially the manner by\nwhich analytic continuation turns a leading order result into a next-to-leading order result,\nwe can summarize the BPS procedure by the following prescription:\n1. Calculate the rate dE >/dt in the regime \u03bd > 3 using the Boltzmann equation, including\nquantum corrections to all orders in \u03b7. This captures the leading order physics in\ndimensions greater than three.\n2. Calculate the corresponding rate dE </dt in the regime \u03bd < 3 using the Lenard-Balescu\nequation. This physics is classical, and captures the leading order behavior in dimensions less than three.\n41\n\n\f3. Add the terms dE >/dt and dE </dt and take the \u03bd \u2192 3 limit. This gives the energy\nexchange rate in three dimensions accurate to leading and next-to-leading order in g,\ndE/dt = \u2212Ag 2 ln{C(\u03b7)g} + O(g 3 ). That is to say, this gives the coefficients A and C\nexactly.\nThis prescription provides complete analytic expressions for the coefficients A and C(\u03b7),\nwith C(\u03b7) being of particular interest. In the language of the Coulomb logarithm, we write\nln \u039bcoul (g, \u03b7) = \u2212 ln{C(\u03b7)g}.\nB.\n\nFurther Context\n\nThe fundamental interactions of nature can be expressed as quantum field theories (except\nfor gravity22 , which to date has only been expressed as a classical field theory, i.e. general\nrelativity). For this reason, quantum field theory reveals something very deep about the\nstructure of nature. However, for our purposes, we only need to think of quantum field\ntheory as an elegant collection of tools for packaging and solving many-body problems,\nand plasma physics concerns itself with the many-body problem par excellence. It should\ntherefore come as little surprise that quantum field theory can be useful for plasma physics.\nReference [1] is a nice example of cross fertilization between two quite different branches\nof physics, and it is gratifying for someone who has worked in both particle and plasma\nphysics that such seemingly different subjects can inform one another. Perhaps the most\ndramatic difference between particle and plasma physics lies with their respective methods\nand outlooks, and not so much the subject matter itself. A number of plasma physicist\nhave explained to me that that plasma physics is not an exact science. While the nature of\nthe subject might render a first-principles approach limited, particularly for subtopics like\nmagneto-hydrodynamics in tokamaks or self-organized behavior in strongly coupled plasmas,\nI believe the plasma physicist could still benefit from the more rigorous outlook of particle\nphysics. Conversely, the particle physicist could benefit from plasma physics. In fact, until\nnew high energy experiments come on-line, plasma physics may have more to offer particle\nphysics than the reverse.23 Until recently, high energy physics was a spectacular field in\n22\n\n23\n\nThere have of course been numerous attempts at quantizing gravity, but since none of these has yet\nproduced a full fledged theory of quantum gravity, I do not count them here. In fact, it might not be\npossible to describe gravity with a field theory on the quantum level. This would be true, for example, if\nstring theory were to provide the theory of quantum gravity, since a string theory is qualitatively different\nfrom a field theory.\nParticle physics is currently in crisis brought on from a dearth, and indeed a complete absence, of new\nexperimental results. The only hope for high energy physics seems to lie with the Large Hadron Collider\nat CERN, or its possible successors. Compare this situation with the current Renaissance in observational\ncosmology and astrophysics, which has more and better quality data than at any time during its history.\n\n42\n\n\fwhich to work, but, with a few exceptions such as lattice gauge theory and RHIC physics\nat BNL, the field seems to have been milked dry. High energy physics is in dire need of\ndirect experimental input. Plasma physics, on the other hand, still has many interesting\nand quite challenging problems of experimental and astrophysical relevance, and a number\nof these seem tailor-made for the field theorist. The particle physicist could therefore benefit\nby an excursion (or even a longer stay) in plasma physics. Hence, my hidden agenda in\nthese lectures: it would be quite nice to entice a few particle theorists to work on some of\nthe interesting problems of plasma physics. It would also be nice to convince a few plasma\nphysicists that particle theory has something to offer them as well.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis manuscript arose from a series of lectures presented to the Applied Physics Division's\nPlasma Working Group in August 2006 at the Los Alamos National Laboratory.

At the 10% level, string theory and the like might be healthy (after all, a quantum description\nof gravity simply falls out of string theory, and it is hard to believe that this is an accident); however, at\nthe current level, string theory and its kinfolk are as stifling as a hillside of kudzu in Tennessee.\n\n43\n\n\f[6] J.

(19) was in error\nwas repeatedly pointed out to the author, in private communication, by V.F. Weisskopf and\nJ.B.

French has finally shown that although the expression for the radiationless\nscattering in B, Eq. (18) or (24) above is correct, it was incorrectly joined onto Bethe's nonrelativistic result. He shows that the relation ln 2kmax \u2212 1 = ln \u03bbmin used by the author should\nhave been ln 2kmax \u2212 5/6 = ln \u03bbmin . This results in adding a term \u2212(1/6) to the logarithm in B,\nEq. (19) so that the result now agrees with that of J.B. French and V.W. Weisskopf, Phys.\nRev. 75, 1240 (1949) and N.H.
