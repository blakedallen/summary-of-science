These new bursts observed at ertain frequen y being ompared\nto the usual Type III bursts at the same frequen y show similar behaviour but feature frequen y drift 2-6\ntimes higher than the normal bursts. In this paper we report the \u001crst observations of Type III-like bursts in\nde ameter range, arried out during summer ampaigns 2002 - 2004 at UTR-2 radio teles ope. The ir ular\npolarization of the bursts was measured by the radio teles ope URAN-2 in 2004. The observed bursts are\nanalyzed and ompared with usual Type III bursts in the de ameter range. From the analysis of over 1100\nType III-like bursts, their main parameters have been found. Chara teristi feature of the observed bursts\nis similar to Type III-like bursts at other frequen ies, i.e. measured drift rates (5-10 MHz/s) of this bursts\nare few times larger than that for usual Type III bursts, and their durations (1-2 s) are few times smaller\nthan that for usual Type III bursts in this frequen y band.\n\nIntrodu tion\nFor the \u001crst time Type III-like bursts were observed in the frequen y range 500 - 950 MHz [6\u2104. Their\nfrequen y rates were higher than 2000 MHz/s and sometimes even in\u001cnite. The author also reported bursts\nwith reverse drifts (from low to high frequen ies). The observed number of Type III-like bursts was 20% of\nnormal Type III bursts. Durations of fast bursts ranged from 0.3 s to 2 s. A ording to [6\u2104, their radio \u001duxes\nhad values from 5 s.f.u. to 50000 s.f.u. There was a tenden y that the faster Type III-like bursts had shorter\nduration.\nIn paper [5\u2104 it was found that Type III-like bursts appeared mainly in the frequen y band 400-800 MHz,\nbut sometimes this band was as wide as 200-950 MHz. There was information [2\u2104 that Type III-like bursts\nwere observed at frequen ies 40 MHz and 60 MHz.\nDetailed analysis of properties of Type III-like bursts observed at frequen ies 310-340 MHz was performed\nin [3, 4\u2104. It was found that 50%, 17% and 33% of Type III-like bursts out of 402 analyzed ones had forward,\nreverse and in\u001cnite drift rates, respe tively. The mean duration of Type III-like bursts was 0.26 s whi h is\n1/4 of that for usual meter range Type III bursts. Paper [3\u2104 showed that frequen y drift rates and durations\nof these bursts depended on the position of the a tive region asso iated with these bursts on the solar disk.\nFrom this fa t the author on luded that propagation e\u001be ts play a signi\u001c ant role in generation of these\nbursts.\nAn attempt to \u001cnd Type III-like bursts in de ameter range was reported in paper [7\u2104, where the authors\nanalyzed the storm observed at UTR-2 radio teles ope on June, 8-9, 1977. Authors on luded that if su h\nbursts existed they had drift rates and durations lose to that for usual Type III bursts.\nIn this paper we present results of observations of de ameter (10-30 MHz) Type III-like bursts at radio\nteles ope UTR-2 performed in 2002-2004 and URAN-2 in 2004, we also analyze their parameters and dis uss\ntheir properties.\n\n68\n\n\fYSC'14 Pro eedings of Contributed Papers\n\nV.N. Melnik, A.A. Konovalenko, et al.\n\nFigure 1: Dynami spe trum of Type III-like burst. Three bright verti al areas at 10:43:40, 10:44:35 and 10:45:00\norrespond to normal Type III bursts, and a narrow bright line at 10:44:30 indi ates a Type III-like burst.\n\nObservations\nType III-like bursts reported in this paper were registered at radio teles ope UTR-2 during summer\nampaigns of 2002-2004 years. Three se tions of the radio teles ope, with e\u001be tive area of 30000 m2 providing\nthe beam of 1\u25e6 \u00d7 13\u25e6 were used. In 2002 the registrations were arried out by a Digital Spe trum Polarimeter\n(DSP) with frequen y resolution 12 kHz, time resolution 20 ms, 50 ms and 100 ms, and sensitivity 5 Jy. The\nfrequen y band in these observations was 12 MHz. The measurements in 2003-2004 were arried out by a\n60- hannel spe trometer with frequen y resolution 3 kHz, and time resolution of 10 ms at frequen y range\n10-30 MHz.\nA ording to the observations in the de ameter range (10 - 30 MHz), the usual Type III bursts have\nfrequen y drift rates of 2-4 MHz/s and durations of 4 - 10 s. Besides these bursts we registered fast Type\nIII bursts, with drift rates ex eeded, sometimes onsiderably, those for typi al Type III bursts. Following\n[3\u2104, these fast bursts an be alled as Type III-like bursts. In this report we onsider the bursts observed in\n2002 (July 13-17, July 26-30 and August 16-19), 2003 (July 1-6), and in 2004 (June 17-22).\nThe total time of observations was approximately 120 hours and there were dete ted about 1100 Type\nIII-like bursts. All bursts had negative frequen y drift rates (from high to low frequen ies). De ameter Type\nIII-like bursts similarly to their high frequen y analogs were shorter than usual Type III bursts (Figure 1),\nand their time pro\u001cles were symmetri al (Figure 2). There were fast bursts with \u001cne frequen y stru ture\nsimilar to Type IIIb bursts, whi h we all Type IIIb-like bursts. The fastest Type III-like burst was observed\non August 18, 2002 with the drift rate of about 40 MHz/s.\n\nAnalysis\nThe big number of observed bursts allows statisti al analysis of Type III-like bursts. The distribution of\nType III-like bursts a ording to their frequen y drift rates is shown in Fig. 3a. The majority of bursts have\nfrequen y rates 12 MHz/s, though there are bursts with essentially larger rate values.\nOne an see, that in the de ameter range the drift rate of fast bursts is few times bigger than that for usual\nbursts. A similar relation between the fast and normal Type III bursts was observed at higher frequen ies\n[3, 4, 5\u2104.\nThe typi al duration of de ameter Type III-like burst is 1-2 s (Fig. 3b), whi h is about 1/4 of the average\nduration of ordinary de ameter Type III bursts, their \u001dux values are in the range 10 to 60 s.f.u. (Fig. 4a).\nWe analyzed 5 storms and found that the majority of Type III-like bursts had been observed when the\na tive regions asso iated with them were lo ated near the entral solar meridian, a ording to the data from\nPulkovo Observatory of Russian A ademy of S ien es [8\u2104.

The maximum on 4 July orresponds to the\nday, when the a tive region asso iated with the Type III-like bursts was near to the entral meridian. An\neven more interesting ase of two overlapping peaks on a similar frequen y o urren e diagram was observed\nwhen two a tive regions on the Sun disk appear within a short time interval.\nDuring the storm of June 17-22, 2004, the measurements of polarizations were made for a part of Type\nIII-like bursts by means of radio teles ope URAN-2 [1\u2104. The polarization degree of Type III-like bursts\nproved to be equal to 10-15%. There were also observed Type III-like bursts with \u001cne frequen y stru ture\nsimilar to usual Type IIIb bursts. Su h Type III-like bursts were not observed at higher frequen ies, they\nare typi al for the de ameter range only.\nUp to now, all kinds of Type III and Type III-like bursts were explained by the gradients of plasma\ndensity in the solar orona. A ording to some models, the fast Type III-like bursts in the high frequen y\nrange appear due to the fa t that they are generated in the low orona, where the density pro\u001cle is steeper\n[3, 6\u2104. Following this model, the observed high frequen y drift rates of de ameter Type III-like bursts for es\nus to suppose that su h density gradient is even higher in the orona, and su h irregularities must o upy\nvery large regions ( omparable with the solar radius). However there is no eviden e for existen e of su h\nhigh density gradients in the orona. This leaves unanswered the question about generation of big number of\nthe Type III-like bursts in the de ameter range. The dependen e of appearan e rate of Type III-like bursts\nvia a tive region position suggests that the propagation e\u001be ts of ele tromagneti waves in the solar orona\nshould be of big importan e in this pro ess.\n\nCon lusions\nFor the \u001crst time we dis overed the Type III-like bursts in de ameter range. These bursts show properties\nsimilar to those for Type III-like bursts observed at higher frequen ies. For example, their durations are\n1/4 of usual de ameter Type III bursts durations, and their drift rates are few times of those for the usual\nde ameter Type III bursts. The number of Type III-like bursts orrelates with the position of the a tive\nregion asso iated with them. A ording to the polarization measurements of these bursts (approximately\n10-15%), one an on lude that they seem to be generated at the se ond harmoni of the plasma frequen y.\nThe existing model of high frequen y Type III-like bursts assume that the plasma density gradients are mu h\nhigher in the low orona. Su h assumption annot be applied to the de ameter bursts. The total number of\nType III-like bursts in the de ameter range is remarkably high (up to one bursts per 2.5 minutes), therefore\nthey annot be explained by o asional extraordinary variations of solar parameters, and there should exist\na model based on typi al values of solar parameters.\nTaking into a ount signi\u001c ant similarity between Type III-like bursts at high frequen y observed before\nand re ently observed de ameter Type III-like burst (in parti ular the orrelation between the position of\nthe a tive region on the solar disk and the burst o urren e rate) it may appear that the suggested model of\n71\n\n\fYSC'14 Pro eedings of Contributed Papers\n\nV.N.
