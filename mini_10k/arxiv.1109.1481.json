It is also seen that the\nbackground dynamics of modified Chaplygin gas is completely consistent with the notion of an accelerated\nexpansion in the late universe. Finally, it has been shown that the universe in both the models follows\nthe power law form of expansion around the critical point, which is consistent with the known results.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe idea of the static universe once conceived by Albert Einstein faced a big threat when at the turn of the last century\nobservations of Ia Supernova confirmed that our universe is suffering from an accelerated expansion (Perlmutter, S.\net al., 1999; Spergel, D. N. et al.2003). Now belief and observations are always to be supported by some model. In\nthe quest of finding a suitable model for universe, Cosmologists started to investigate the root cause that is triggering\nthis expansion. Fundamentally, we were to modify Einstein's equation either by modifying the left hand side, i.e.,\nmodifying the idea of Einstein gravity or to modify the right hand side which immediately speculate the nature of\nthe matter inside the universe. If our Universe is filled up by some invisible fluid causing a negative pressure then it\nviolates the strong energy condition i.e. \u03c1 + 3p < 0. Because of its invisible nature this energy component was aptly\ntermed as dark energy (DE) (Riess, A. G. et al., 2004).\nWith the introduction of DE, the search began for different candidates that can effectively play the role of DE.\nDE represented by a scalar field 4 is often called quintessence. Not only scalar field but also there are other Dark\nfluid models like Chaplygin gas which plays the role of DE very efficiently. The earliest form of this was known as\npure Chaplygin gas (Kamenshchik, A. et al.,2001; Gorini, V. et al. 2004). Extensive research saw pure Chaplygin\ngas first modify into generalized Chaplygin gas (Gorini, V. et al., 2006; Alam, U. et al. 2003; Bento, M. C. et al.\n2002;Carturan, D. and Finelli, F. 2003; Barreiro, T. and Sen, A.A. 2004) and later into modified Chaplygin gas (MCG)\nobeying the equation of state (Benaoum, H. B., 2002; Debnath, U., 2004)\np = A\u03c1 \u2212\n\nB\n,\n\u03c1\u03b1\n\n(1)\n\nwhere p and \u03c1 are respectively the pressure and energy density and 0 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 1, A and B are positive constants.\nCurrently, we live in a special epoch where the densities of DE and DM are comparable. Although they have evolved\n1\n\nprudra.math@gmail.com\nujjal@iucaa.ernet.in, ujjaldebnath@yahoo.com\n3\nbiswas.ritabrata@gmail.com\n4\nin the presence of a scalar field the transition from a universe filled with matter to an exponentially expanding universe is\njustified\n2\n\n1\n\n\findependently from different mass scales. This is known as the famous cosmic coincidence problem. till date several\nattempts have been made to find a solution to this problem (del Campo, S. et al 2009; Leon, G. and Saridakis, E.N.\n2010; Jimenez, J.B. and Maroto, A.L.2008; Berger, M.S. and Shojae, H. 2006; Zhang, X. 2005; Griest, K. 2002; Jamil,\nM. and Rehman, F. 2009; Jamil, M. et al. 2010a; Jamil, M. and Saridakis, E. N. 2010b; Jamil, M. and Farooq, M.\nU., 2010c; Jamil, M. et al. 2010d). A suitable interaction between DE and DM is required if we wish to find an\neffective solution to this problem. It is obvious that there has been a transition from a matter dominated universe\nto dark energy dominated universe, by exchange of energy at an appropriate rate. Now the expansion history of the\nuniverse as determined by the supernovae and CMB data (Jamil, M.et al. 2010a; Jamil, M. and Saridakis, E. N.\n2010b) bounds us to fix the decay rate such that it is proportional to the present day Hubble parameter. Keeping the\nfact in mind cosmologists all over the world have studied and proposed a variety of interacting DE models (Setare, M.\nR. 2006,2007c; Hu, B. and Ling, Y. 2006; Wu, P. and Yu, H. 2007; Jamil, M. 2010e, 2011; Dalal, N. 2001).\nHere we shall use MCG as the DE and the equation of state for MCG is given by (1) with \u03c1 = \u03c1mcg Recent\ndevelopments regarding MCG can be found in (Lu, J. et al. 2008; Dao-Jun, L., Xin-Zhou, L. 2005; Jing, H. et. al.\n2008; Debnath, U. 2007). This special form also appears to be consistent with the WMAP 5-year data and henceforth\nsupport the unified model with DE and DM based on generalized CG (Makler, M. et al. 2003; Setare, M.R. 2007a,\n2007b, 2009; Barreiro, T. et al. 2008). Recent supernovae data also favours the two-fluid cosmological model with CG\nand matter (Panotopoulos, G. 2008).\nAs we have stated earlier, modifying the right hand side of Einstein's equation was not the only way to explain\nthe increase in the rate of the expansion, rather to modify the gravity part of the left hand side is also to demonstrate\nthe present day universe. In this branch Brane-gravity was introduced and brane cosmology was developed. A review\non brane-gravity and its various applications with special attention to cosmology is available in (Rubakov, V. A. 2001;\nMaartens, R. 2004; Brax. P. et al. 2004; Csa ki, C. 2004). In this work we consider the two most popular brane\nmodels, namely DGP and RS II branes. Our main aim of this work is to examine the nature of the different physical\nparameters for the universe around the stable critical points in two brane world models in presence of MCG. Impact\nof any future singularity caused by the DE in brane world models will be studied.\nThis paper is organized as follows: Section 2 comprises of the dynamical system analysis in DGP brane model.\nSection 3 deals with the dynamical system analysis in RS II brane model, followed by a general discussion in section\n4.\n\n2\n\nDynamical system analysis in DGP brane world model\n\nA simple and effective model of brane-gravity is the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) braneworld model (Dvali, G.\nR. et al. 2000; Deffayet, D. 2001; Deffayet, D. et al. 2002) which models our 4-dimensional world as a FRW brane\nembedded in a 5-dimensional Minkowski bulk. It explains the origin of DE as the gravity on the brane leaking to the\nbulk at large scale. On the 4-dimensional brane the action of gravity is proportional to Mp2 whereas in the bulk it is\nproportional to the corresponding quantity in 5-dimensions. The model is then characterized by a cross over length\nM2\n\nscale rc = 2Mp2 such that gravity is 4-dimensional theory at scales a << rc where matter behaves as pressureless dust,\n5\nbut gravity leaks out into the bulk at scales a >> rc and matter approaches the behaviour of a cosmological constant.\nMoreover it has been shown that the standard Friedmann cosmology can be firmly embedded in DGP brane.\nIt may be noted that in literature, standard DGP model has been generalized to (i) LDGP model by adding a\ncosmological constant (Lue,A. and Starkman,G. D. 2004), (ii) QDGP model by adding a quintessence perfect fluid\n(Chimento,L. P. et al. 2006), (iii) CDGP model by Chaplygin gas (Bouhmadi-Lopez, M. and Lazkoz, R. 2007) and\n(iv) SDGP by a scalar field (Zhang, H. and Zhu, Z. H. 2007). In (Wu, X. et al. 2008) the DGP model has been\nanalysed by adding Holographic DE (HDE).\n\n2.1\n\nBasic equations in DGP brane model\n\nWhile flat, homogeneous and isotropic brane is being considered, the Friedmann equation in DGP brane model(Dvali,\nG. R. et al, 2000; Deffayet, D., 2001; Deffayet, D. et al, 2002) is modified to the equation\n2\n\nH =\n\nwhere H =\n\n\u0227\na\n\ns\n\n\u03c1\n1\n1\n+ 2 +\u01eb\n3 4rc\n2rc\n\n!2\n\n,\n\n(2)\n\nis the Hubble parameter, \u03c1 is the total cosmic fluid energy density and rc =\n\nwhich determines the transition from 4D to 5D behaviour and \u01eb = \u00b11 (choosing\n\n2\n\nMp2\n\nMp2\n2M52\n\nis the cross-over scale\n\n= 8\u03c0G = 1). For \u01eb = +1, we\n\n\fhave standard DGP(+) model which is self accelerating model without any form of DE, and effective w is always\nnon-phantom. However for \u01eb = \u22121, we have DGP(\u2212) model which does not self accelerate but requires DE on the\nbrane. It experiences 5D gravitational modifications to its dynamics which effectively screen DE. Brane world scenario\nis actually a modified gravity theory. If we write the Einstein equation for brane world in terms of Einstein gravity\nthen the extra term can be treated as the effective DE But that is not the physical DE. Moreover this DE is applicable\nonly in Einstein gravity. But here we will consider the physical DE in brane world. So we have introduced the MCG\ntype fluid in brane. There are few many candidates of DE models, such as scalar field (Nojiri, S.and Oditsov, S.D.\n2004), phantom (Nojiri, S. et al 2005), k-essence (Bamba, K.et al 2011), tachyonic field ((Nojiri, S.and Oditsov, S.D.\n2003), etc. MCG being a modified form of DE with a unique equation of state for DE and DM. Also MCG is the\nobservational viable model (Thakur, P. et al 2009, Dev, A. et al 2003). It interpolates between radiation in early stage\nand \u039bCDM in late stage.\nAs in the present problem the interaction between DE and pressureless dark matter has been taken into account\nfor interacting DE and DM the energy balance equation will be\n\u03c1\u0307mcg + 3H (1 + wmcg ) \u03c1mcg = \u2212Q,\n\nf or M CG and\n\n(3)\n\n\u03c1\u0307m + 3H\u03c1m = Q, f or the DM interacting with M CG.\n\n(4)\n\nwhere Q = 3bH\u03c1 is the interaction term, b is the coupling parameter (or transfer strength) and \u03c1 = \u03c1mcg + \u03c1m is\nthe total cosmic energy density which satisfies the energy conservation equation \u03c1\u0307 + 3H (\u03c1 + p) = 0 (Guo, Z.-K. and\nZhang, Y.-Z. 2005; delCampo, S. et. al. 2008).\nAs we have lack of information about the fact how do DE and DM interact so we are not able to esteemate the\ninteraction term from the first principles. However, the negativity of Q immediately implies the possibility of having\nnegative DE in the early universe which is overruled by to the necessity of the second law of thermodynamics to be\nheld(Alcaniz, J. S. and Lima, J. A. S. 2005). Hence Q must be positive and small. From the observational data\nof 182 Gold type Ia supernova samples, CMB data from the three year WMAP survey and the baryonic acoustic\noscillations from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, it is estimated that the coupling parameter between DM and DE must\nbe a small positive value (of the order of unity), which satisfies the requirement for solving the cosmic coincidence\nproblem and the second law of thermodynamics (Feng, C. et. al. 2008). Due to the underlying interaction, the\nbeginning of the accelerated expansion is shifted to higher redshifts. Consequently using the Friedmann equation (2)\nand the conservation equation, we obtain the modified Raychaudhuri equation\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u01eb\n\u1e22 = \u2212H (\u03c1 + p) ,\n(5)\n2H \u2212\nrc\n\n2.2\n\nDynamical system analysis\n\nIn this subsection we plan to analyse the dynamical system.

According to this model we live in a four dimensional world (called 3-brane, a domain\nwall) which is embedded in a 5D space time (bulk). All matter fields are confined in the brane whereas gravity can\nonly propagate in the bulk.

Like before here also we calculate the statefinder parameters {r, s}\nin order to get relevant information of DE and DM in the context of background geometry only without depending\non the theory of gravity.

We discuss the results\nobtained in the two models separately.\nDGP BRAN E M ODEL\nThe dimensionless density parameters v and u are drawn in figures 1 and 2. From the figures we see that v\ndecreases, and u increases during evolution of the universe. This shows that the density of DM decreases while the\ndensity of DE increases as the universe evolves. So this result is consistent with the well known idea of an energy\ndominated universe. The phase space diagram (figure 3) shows the attractor solution. The eigen values are calculated\nat the critical point and found to be (1.97625, \u2212 1.09495). Hence the critical point is a saddle point.\nFigure 4 shows the variations of the deceleration parameter, q against wmcg . From figure 4, it is evident that\nthere is a gradual decrease in the deceleration parameter q, and finally in the late universe it attains negative values,\nwhich suggests that there should be an acceleration in the late universe. This result is in accordance with the various\nobservational data of Ia supernovae and CMB data which suggests that the universe is undergoing an accelerated\nexpansion of late. Figure 5 and 6 shows the variations of the statefinder parameters r and s against wmcg . From these\nfigures it can be seen that r tends towards 1 and s tends towards 0. Therefore it is evident that these results tends\ntowards the \u039bCDM model. Figure 7 shows the variation of the ratio of the density parameter v and u with time.\nFrom the figure it is evident that the ratio of the above parameters decreases with time. So it can be concluded that\nthere is a relative decrease in matter density with respect to the energy density. This is again consistent with the\nnotion of an energy dominated universe.\nRSII BRAN E M ODEL\nThe dimensionless density parameters v and u in case of RSII brane model are drawn in figures 8 and 9. From the\nfigures it is evident that at early stages of evolution of universe density of DM decreases steeply relative to the density\nof DE such that finally an energy dominated scenario is witnessed in the late universe. The phase space diagram (figure\n10) shows the attractor solution for the model. The eigen values are calculated at all the three critical points. At the\nfirst critical point the eigen values are found to be (402.877, 204.835). Hence the first critical point is an unstable node.\nAt the second critical point the eigen values are found to be (1214.75, 565.097). Hence the second critical point is also\nan unstable node. At the third critical point the eigen values calculated are (\u221225.3905+2257.49i, \u221225.3905\u22122257.49i).\nHence the third critical point is a stable focus.\nFigure 11 shows the behaviour of deceleration parameter q as it is plotted against the state parameter wmcg . The\nfigure shows that there is a gradual decrease in the deceleration parameter with time. Finally in the late universe the\ndeceleration parameter q becomes negative, which confirms the fact that the universe is undergoing an accelerated\nexpansion. In Figures 12 and 13, the statefinder parameters r and s are plotted against wmcg . Finally in Figure 14\nthe ratio of the density parameters v and u is plotted against time. From the figure it is found that just like DGP\nbrane here also there is a relative decrease in matter density with respect to the energy density. This is consistent\nwith the notion of an energy dominated universe. Henceforth we find a solution for the cosmic coincidence problem.\n\n11\n\n\f5\n\nStudy of Future Singularities\n\nIt is a well known fact that any energy dominated model of the universe is destined to result in a future singularity.\nThe study of dynamics of an accelerating universe in the presence of DE and DM is in fact incomplete without studying\nthese singularities, which are the ultimate fate of the universe. MCG, being a very generalized form of DE can step\ninto the phantom era with the EoS (w < \u22121) for definite values of the constants A and B. It is known that the universe\ndominated by phantom energy ends with a future singularity known as Big Rip (Caldwell, R. R., 2003), due to the\nviolation of dominant energy condition (DEC). But this is not the only type of singularity possible. Nojiri et al (2005)\nstudied the various types of singularities that can result from an phantom energy dominated universe. These possible\nsingularities are characterized by the growth of energy and curvature at the time of occurrence of the singularity. It\nis found that near the singularity quantum effects becomes very dominant which may alleviate or even prevent these\nsingularities. So it is extremely necessary to study these singularities and classify them accordingly so that we can\nsearch for methods to eliminate them. The appearance of all four types of future singularities in coupled fluid dark\nenergy, F (R) theory, modified Gauss-Bonnet gravity and modified F (R) Horava-Lifshitz gravity was demonstrated in\n(Nojiri, S. and Odintsov, S. D., 2011). The universal procedure for resolving such singularities that may lead to bad\nphenomenological consequences was proposed. Nojiri, S. and Odintsov, S. D., 2011 classified and studied four types\nof such singularities in detail. We analyze two possible future singularities in case of MCG in brane world scenarios.\nType I (\"Big Rip\") : For t \u2192 ts , a \u2192 \u221e , \u03c1 \u2192 \u221e and |p| \u2192 \u221e\nType II (\"Sudden\") : For t \u2192 ts , a \u2192 as , \u03c1 \u2192 \u03c1s and |p| \u2192 \u221e\nHere we have considered MCG as the DE in DGP and RS2 brane models. 1) Phantom era is realized for MCG\n1\nB \u03b1+1\nwhen \u03c1 < [ A+1\n]\n. From the MCG equation of state i.e p = A\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1B\u03b1 we see that when \u03c1 \u2192 \u221e , |p| \u2192 \u221e when\na \u2192 \u221e and t \u2192 ts . Therefore it is seen that Type I singularity is quite obvious for MCG. This is the well known Big\nRip singularity.\n2) Suppose if \u03c1 \u2192 \u03c1s and \u03c1s \u223c 0, then |p| \u2192 \u2212\u221e for t \u2192 ts and a \u2192 as Hence we get the type II singularity. This\nis called a sudden singularity.\nThe stability of the critical points analyzed in the last section will be occurred much before than the singularities\ntake place, so any direct impact of the singularities of the dynamical system will not be observed. The big rip and\nsudden singularity may be formed before the critical points to be formed.\n\n6\n\nConcluding Remarks\n\nIn this work, we have considered a combination of Modified Chaplygin gas in DGP and RSII brane gravity models.\nOur basic idea was to study the background dynamics of MCG in detail when it is incorporated in brane gravity.\nDynamical system analysis had been carried out, critical points were found and the stability of the system around\nthose critical points was tested for both DGP and RSII brane models. Graphical analysis was done to get an explicit picture of the outcome of the work. In order to find a solution for the cosmic coincidence problem, a suitable\ninteraction between DE and DM was considered. The dynamical system of equations characterizing the system was\nformed and a stable scaling solution was obtained. The numerical values of the density parameters for DE and DM\nalmost coincided with each other (as seen in graphs 8 and 9). Hence this work can be considered to be a significant one as far as solution of cosmic coincidence problem is concerned. From the above analysis we conclude that the\ncombination of MCG in brane gravity makes a perfect model for the expanding universe undergoing a late acceleration.\nAchknowledgement:\nRB thanks to State Govt. of West Bengal, India for awarding SRF.\n\nReferences\nAlam, U., Sahni, V., Saini, T.
