We explore\na possible explanation of the puzzling lack of variability of the iron line, by assuming\nthat the variations of the power law component are due to changes in the height of\nthe primary source in the near vicinity of a rotating black hole. Due to the bending\nof light in the strong field of the central black hole, the apparent brightness of the\npower-law component can vary by about a factor 4 according to its position, while the\ntotal iron line flux variability is less than 20 per cent. This behaviour is obtained if\nthe primary source is located within 3\u20134 gravitational radii (rg ) from the rotation axis\nwith a variable height of between \u223c 3 and 8 rg . These results revive the possibility that\nfuture X\u2013ray observations of MCG\u20136-30-15 can map out the strong gravity regime of\naccreting black holes.\nKey words: accretion discs - black hole physics - line: profiles - X-rays: general\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe X\u2013ray spectrum of the Seyfert 1 galaxy MCG\u20136-30-15\nexhibits a broad emission feature peaked at 6.4 keV which\nextends from below 4 keV to approximately 7 keV, and was\nfirst resolved with ASCA (Tanaka et al. 1995). The profile\nof this feature is consistent with that expected from iron fluorescence from the surface of an accretion disc surrounding\na massive black hole.\nThe X\u2013ray continuum emission of MCG\u20136-30-15\nis highly variable (see e.g. Vaughan, Fabian & Nandra\n2003; Fabian & Vaughan 2003). Since the reflection features, such as the observed iron line, are expected to\nbe due to reprocessing of the hard X\u2013ray continuum by\ndense gas in the accretion disc (George & Fabian 1991;\nMatt, Perola & Piro 1991), the line flux should respond to\nthe changes in the illuminating continuum (Reynolds et al\n1999). Line flux variations have been reported on timescales\nof about 104 s, but with a much smaller amplitude than\nthe observed continuum changes (Iwasawa et al. 1996;\nVaughan & Edelson 2001;\nShih, Iwasawa & Fabian 2002;\nFabian & Vaughan 2003). Furthermore, the variability\nof the iron line flux and the observed continuum are\nuncorrelated.\nThe source spectrum and variability can be explained\n\n\u22c6\n\nE-mail: miniutti@ast.cam.ac.uk\n\nby a two component model (Shih, Iwasawa & Fabian 2002)\nconsisting of a variable power-law component and an almost constant reflection component containing the iron line.\nThis model successfully accounts for the behaviour of MCG\u2013\n6-30-15 during a 320 ks long XMM\u2013Newton observation\n(Fabian & Vaughan 2003). Hereafter, we shall refer to these\ncomponents as the Power Law Component (PLC) and the\nReflection\u2013Dominated Component (RDC). The existence of\na varying soft component with a spectral shape uncorrelated\nwith flux together with an almost constant harder component is also evident in the linearity of the flux\u2013flux relationship recently presented by Taylor, Uttley & Mc Hardy\n(2003).\nThe extreme red wing of the iron line indicates\nthat the inner radius of the disc extends down to only\na few gravitational radii (Wilms et al 2001; Fabian\net al 2002). Strong gravitational field effects dominate the behaviour of photons in this region with\nnot only gravitational redshift being severe but also\ngravitational light bending (Martocchia & Matt 1996;\nMartocchia, Karas & Matt 2000;\nDabrowski & Lasenby 2001; Martocchia, Matt & Karas 2002).\nFabian & Vaughan (2003) have recently suggested that\nchanges in the position of the power\u2013law emission region\ncould lead to large variations in the observed flux together\nwith a strong and almost constant reflection component,\ncontaining the broad iron line. This behaviour would be due\n\n\f2\n\nG. Miniutti, A.C. Fabian, R. Goyder and A.N. Lasenby\n\npredominantly to strong light bending, which is expected\nif the primary source is located close to the central black\nhole and illuminates the inner regions of the accretion\ndisc, as the shape of the iron line suggests. As the source\napproaches these regions of the disc close to the black hole\nso more radiation is bent away from our line of sight and\nintercepted by the disc. Such light bending also explains\nthe high observed equivalent width of the line.\nIn this Letter, we investigate, for the parameters relevant to MCG\u20136-30-15, the variability of the PLC and of the\nRDC as a function of the position and state of motion of\nthe primary X\u2013ray source, seeking solutions that allow for\na strongly varying PLC and an almost constant RDC. The\nmain purpose of this work is to provide an astrophysical context in which the two component model for the variability of\nMCG\u20136-30-15 can be explained self\u2013consistently. Our calculations are performed using a combination of Monte Carlo\nand ray-tracing methods that take into account the effects of\nDoppler/gravitational redshifts and light beaming/bending\non the motion of photons in the spacetime of a rotating black\nhole.\n\n2\n\nMODEL AND ASSUMPTIONS\n\nThe observed broad iron line profile and its extended\nred wing (Wilms et al. 2001; Fabian et al. 2002) imply that\nmost of the emission originates at radii less than 6rg (rg =\nGM/c2 ), suggesting that the central black hole is rapidly\nspinning (Iwasawa et al. 1996; Dabrowski et al. 1997). Our\ncomputations are then performed in the spacetime of a maximally rotating (Kerr) black hole.\nThe accretion disc is assumed to be thin and to lie in\nthe equatorial plane, perpendicular to the rotation axis. The\naccreting material is flowing along stable circular geodesics\nand the disc extends from the radius rms of the marginal\nstable circular orbit (e.g. Novikov & Thorne 1973) out to\nrout = 100 rg .\nThe source of primary hard X\u2013rays is assumed to have\na ring\u2013like axisymmetric geometry and is located above the\ndisc at a distance \u03c1s from the rotation axis and at height\nhs , related to the Boyer\u2013Lindquist\ncoordinates rs and \u03b8s of\np\nthe source by rs = \u03c12s + h2s and \u03b8s = arctan(\u03c1s /hs ). The\nsource can be both static or corotating with the disc. If the\nsource is static, its 4\u2013velocity has to be proportional to the\ntime\u2013like Killing vector of the spacetime so that\nu = Cstat \u2202t ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhile if it is corotating one has\nu = Ccorot (\u2202t + \u03a9\u2202\u03c6 ) ,\n\n(2)\n3/2\n\nwhere \u03a9 \u2261 1/[a + (r sin \u03b8) ] and where Cstat and Ccorot are\nfound by requiring that the source follows a time\u2013like world\nline (u * u = \u22121).\nThe case of a static source is investigated mainly for\ncomparison with the corotating one that we consider physically more plausible. This is because since flares are believed\nto be associated with magnetic activity of the disc, they\nare more likely to be corotating with the accreting material\nrather than static. In the case of a corotating source, since\nthe orbital timescale in the vicinity of the central massive\nblack hole is much shorter than the integration time needed\n\nin observations, any information on the azimuthal position\nof the flare is lost. This justifies our choice of a ring\u2013like axisymmetric source rather than a point\u2013like whose azimuthal\nposition would affect the iron line profile emitted from the\ndisc but is unobservable with current long observations.\nThe source produces isotropic emission in its proper\nframe with a power law luminosity Ls = L0 Es\u2212\u03b1 , where\nEs is the photon energy in the source comoving frame and\nthe spectral index is chosen to be \u03b1 = 1.1, consistent with\nthe observed photon index in the spectrum of MCG\u20136-3015 (see e.g. Fabian & Vaughan 2003). Isotropic emission is\nenforced by using the HEALPix1 (Hierarchical Equal Area\nisoLatitude Pixelisation) package which allows one to define\nequal area curvilinear quadrilaterals on the sphere. Isotropy\n(in the source proper frame) is obtained by sending photons along the directions defined by the geometrical centre\nof each quadrilateral.\nThe photons emitted by the primary source illuminate\nboth the accretion disc and the collecting area of a distant observer, whose distance from the source is taken to\nbe robs = 103 rg for numerical purposes. The observer measures both the direct flux and the reflected emission from the\ndisc. The observer inclination has been fixed to 30 degrees,\nwhich is appropriate for the case of MCG\u20136-30-15.\nIn this work, we assume that the direct continuum emission from the primary source dominates over the reflected\ncontinuum emission, which is neglected in our computations.\nHowever, since the reflected continuum varies together with\nthe iron line, it does not affect the results on the variability\nof the PLC and of the RDC (hereafter represented by the\niron line only), which are the main purpose of this Letter.\nEach simulation is carried out by sending a given number N of photons from the primary source and by integrating along the null geodesics in the Kerr spacetime until the\nphotons reach the accretion disc (or are lost into the black\nhole horizon) or the observer collecting area. This procedure\nallows us to compute directly the PLC at the observer and\nthe illuminating flux on the disc as a function of the photons\nincident angle \u03b8i and energy Ed , taking into account both\nspecial and general relativistic effects.\nThe iron line local intensity is computed by assuming\nthat the fluorescent photons are produced by cold, non\u2013\nionised matter at the rest frame energy of 6.4 keV and by\nmaking use of the work by George & Fabian (1991) who provided analytical approximations for the dependence of the\nfluorescent emission on \u03b8i and Ed (see also Ruszkowski 2000;\nLu & Yu 2001 for further details). In this work, the iron line\nemission is assumed to be isotropic in the rest frame of the\ndisc, which is not a strong limitation for low inclination objects such as MCG\u20136-30-15.\nTo calculate line profiles and fluxes, we use a ray\u2013tracing\ntechnique to follow the trajectories of photons from the observer until they either intersect the accretion disc or the\nblack hole horizon and we calculate the redshift factor corresponding to each arrival position on the disc (Laor 1991;\nDabrowski et al. 1997). Then the line flux is obtained by\nmaking use of the relativistic invariance of I\u03bd /\u03bd 3 , where I\u03bd\nis the specific line intensity, and by integrating over the solid\nangle subtended by the whole disc at the observer.\n\n1\n\nsee http://www.eso.org/science/healpix\n\n\fThe lack of variability of the iron line in MCG\u20136-30-15: GR effects\n\n3\n\n100\n90\n80\n\nEW\nPLC\nRDC\n\n1400\n\ninfinity\n\n70\n\n1200\n\n60\n\nEW [ eV ]\n\nphotons [ % ]\n\n1600\n\ndisc + hole\ndisc\n\n50\n40\n\n1000\n800\n600\n\n30\n400\n\n20\n\n200\n\n10\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25 30\nhs [ rg ]\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\nFigure 1.

As an example, for a source height of hs = 2 rg , the\npercentage of photons that reach the accretion disc is 64 per\ncent. The remaining 36 per cent is equally distributed between photons that are lost in the hole horizon and those\nthat reach the observer at infinity. Similar results are obtained also in the case of a corotating source. However in\nthe latter case, fewer photons are lost into the hole horizon\n(8 per cent) due to the strong beaming in the direction of the\nsource motion that reduces the number of photons directed\ntowards the hole. The illumination pattern on the disc is\nthen more extended for a corotating source (74 per cent of\nthe photons hit the disc) than for a static one.\nHere, the PLC variability is supposed to be caused by\nvariations of the primary source position. Since the source\n\n4\n\nFigure 2. PLC and RDC components as a function of the source\nheight. The iron line EW \u2261 RDC/PLC is also shown.

Same as Fig. 2 but for a corotating source at \u03c1s =\n2.0 rg .\n\nheight controls the amount of direct radiation that reaches\nthe observer (see Fig. 1), the observed PLC from a source\nclose to the black hole is much smaller than that of a source\nlocated at larger height. At the same time, the RDC responds to a much larger region than the PLC, especially if\nthe source is corotating, and it is likely to vary less than the\npower law component.\nTo illustrate this behaviour, and to compare the variation of the two components we present results for sources\nlocated at \u03c1s = 2 rg from the rotation axis, but similar results can be obtained within \u03c1s \u2243 3 \u2212 4 rg .

The local iron line emissivity profile on the accretion\ndisc for a corotating source at \u03c1s = 2.0 rg is shown for different\nvalues of the source height. Looking at the right side of the plot\nthe source heights are, from bottom to top, hs = 4, 6, 8, 10.\n\nPLC flux is defined as the observed flux of the power law\ncomponent evaluated at 6.4 keV, while the RDC is the total\niron line observed flux (i.e. the integral over energy of the\nline). We also show the iron line equivalent width defined as\nthe ratio between the RDC and the PLC. The general behaviour is that the variation in EW is dominated by the PLC\nvariability and is clearly anti\u2013correlated with flux. Since we\nneglect the contribution of the reflected continuum, the values of the line EW are overestimated, especially in the most\nextreme cases (low source height) and they have to be taken\nonly as an indication.\nBoth the power law and the reflection\u2013dominated components vary with the height of the primary source, but the\nvariation of the RDC has a much smaller amplitude. This\nbehaviour is enhanced in the corotating case shown in Fig.\n3 where, if the source height changes from 3 to 8 rg , a variation of the PLC by almost a factor 4 is accompanied by\na variation in the RDC with a maximum amplitude of 15\nper cent around its mean value. Even larger variations of\nthe PLC are found for smaller values of \u03c1s , together with\nan almost constant RDC. These results can be compared\nwith the work by Fabian & Vaughan (2003) who analysed\nthe spectral variability of MCG\u20136-30-15 finding variations\nof the RDC up to about 25 per cent within a PLC change\nof about a factor 4.\nWe note here that the two component model also accounts (Vaughan et al 2003, in preparation) for the shape\nand amplitude of the r.m.s. variability spectrum of MCG\u2013\n6-30-15, plotted in Fabian et al. (2002).\n\n3.1\n\nhs = 8.0 rg\nhs = 6.0 rg\nhs = 4.0 rg\nhs = 3.0 rg\n\nEmissivity and line profiles\n\nWe compute the local iron line emissivity profile induced\nby a ring\u2013like primary source by rotating the illumination\npattern of the one for a point\u2013like source over the azimuthal\nposition on the disc.

Iron line profiles for a corotating source at \u03c1s = 2.0 rg\nand for different source heights.\n\nit is a function of the radial position on the disc only. The\nemissivity \u01eb(r) produced by a corotating ring source at \u03c1s =\n2 rg is shown in Fig. 4 for four different source heights. Due\nto the anisotropy of incident radiation (controlled by hs ),\nthe emissivity in the inner regions is reduced by increasing\nthe source height, while it increases in the outer disc (see\nalso Martocchia, Karas & Matt 2000).\nAt a fixed hs , the emissivity is steeper in the inner disc\nthan in the outer regions with a transition region between\nabout 3 and 10 rg . This is in good agreement with a recent\nanalysis (Fabian et al. 2002) where a best fit to the iron line\nof MCG\u20136-30-15 was found by using a broken power law\nemissivity with a break radius of about 6 rg . The outer emissivity index was found to be \u223c 2.5, while a steeper index of\nabout \u223c 4.8 was derived within 6 rg .\nThe iron line profiles are broad with an extended red\nwing if the primary source is located close to the black hole,\nwhile the profile becomes progressively narrower as the distance from the hole is increased. This is due to the different illumination pattern on the accretion disc (and different\nemissivity) for different source heights. If the source is low,\nthe inner regions of the disc are more illuminated resulting\nin the enhancement of the relativistic broadening of the iron\nline. Our model then predicts broader line profiles when the\nsource flux is low (source at low heights). This is indeed\nthe sense of the changes seen in the ASCA 1994 observation\n(Iwasawa et al. 1996). In Fig. 5 we show the line profiles\nobtained in the case of a corotating source at \u03c1s = 2.0 rg\nfor different heights in the range 3 \u2212 8 rg , whose variation\naccounts for a change in the PLC by a factor \u223c 4.\nThe changes in the line profiles for different source\nheights are subtle and it could be difficult to detect them in\nreal X-ray data. If this is the case, an observer would conclude that the line is almost constant both in flux and in\nspectral shape while the PLC varies in normalisation, as it\nseems to be the case in the recent XMM-Newton observation of MCG\u20136-30-15 (Fabian et al. 2002) that was used to\nstudy the source variability (Fabian & Vaughan 2003). This\n\n\fThe lack of variability of the iron line in MCG\u20136-30-15: GR effects\npossibility has been tested by comparing the line profiles we\nproduced with this same data set. We analysed the 3\u201310 keV\ntime\u2013averaged spectrum obtained with the EPIC pn camera\nusing XSPEC version 11 (Arnaud 1996). The spectrum was\nfitted using a simple power law plus the relativistic line produced by our model when a corotating source is placed at\n\u03c1s = 2.0 rg with variable height between 3 and 8 rg .\nThe \u03c72 difference between the two more extreme heights\nis \u2206\u03c72 \u2243 13 with \u03c72 = 265.8 for hs = 3 rg and \u03c72 = 252.9\nfor hs = 8 rg , both with 178 degrees of freedom. However, this simple model leaves some residuals around 6.4 keV\nand the significance of the preferred source height is poor.\nThese residuals can be accounted for by an additional narrow Gaussian component with an equivalent width of only\n\u223c 30 eV that can be due to reflection from distant material\nand is not included in our model for line emission from the\ninner 100 rg of the accretion disc. With the addition of this\ncomponent, the emission line in the XMM-Newton data is\nwell fitted by our model and, most remarkably, the \u03c72 for\nthe most extreme heights is now identical (both models have\n\u03c72 /\u03bd = 190.5/175 \u2243 1.09).\nThis means that, once the narrow line component is\nincluded, the changes in the line shape are substantially reduced and may be difficult to detect with current instruments. If the narrow component is emitted from distant\nmaterial, it is likely to remain constant. Future observations of the source may be capable of resolving the narrow\ncomponent from the broader one emitted from the accretion\ndisc, allowing more stringent constraints to be placed on the\nheight of the illuminating primary source. In summary, the\nmodel we have explored consistently accounts for the uncorrelated variability of the PLC and RDC components and\nproduces also iron line profiles in good agreement with the\nmost recent X\u2013ray observation of MCG\u20136-30-15.\n\n4\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe spectral variability of MCG\u20136-30-15 can be explained\nby an almost constant Reflection\u2013Dominated Component\ntogether with a highly variable Power Law Component.\nHere we have explored a model in which the variability\nof the PLC is accounted for by changes in the height of the\nprimary source above the accretion disc. Light bending by\nthe gravitational field of the black hole substantially reduces\nthe PLC flux at low heights, allowing for high continuum\nvariability. The iron line flux, which represents the RDC, is\nmuch more constant with an amplitude of variation of about\n15\u201320 per cent when the PLC varies by a factor \u223c 4.\nIt should be noted that the region where the flare (or\nmultiple flares) creating the PLC should be located to reproduce this behaviour is close to the rotation axis, within\n3-4 gravitational radii. It is most plausibly powered by magnetic fields from the disc, possibly linking to the hole (e.g.\nBlandford & Znajek 1977; Wilms et al 2001), and perhaps\nforming the base of a jet (note that the radio emission from\nMCG\u20136-30-15 is weak and unresolved, Morganti et al. 1996).\nWe also find that the iron line emissivity on the accretion disc is consistent with a broken power law profile with\na transition between about 3 and 10 rg , in good agreement\nwith recent observations.\nIn summary, the strong light bending close to the black\n\n5\n\nhole can cause the PLC and RDC to appear disconnected.\nEven if the source of the PLC is intrinsically constant in\nluminosity, it will appear to an outside observer to vary if\nits height from the disc changes. Much of the radiation is\nbent onto the disc in a manner which means that the flux of\nthe RDC will appear constant. Subtle profile changes are expected in the sense that the line will appear narrower when\nthe PLC is bright and broader when dim, but they are difficult to detect with current instruments.\nIt is of course possible that the source of the PLC undergoes intrinsic luminosity variations on both short and long\ntimescales. These will lead to connected variability between\nthe PLC and RDC, and reverberation on short timescales.\nFor MCG\u20136-30-15 these timescales are probably less than\n103 s, too short to be investigated with XMM-Newton but\nwithin the grasp of Constellation-X.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe would like to thank the referee, Dr. Giorgio Matt, for his\nhelpful comments.
