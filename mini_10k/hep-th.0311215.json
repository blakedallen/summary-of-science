W. Nye\n\nDoctor of Philosophy\nUniversity of Edinburgh\n2001\n\n\fAbstract\nCalorons, or periodic instantons, are anti-self-dual (ASD) connections on S 1 \u00d7 R3 , and\n\nform an intermediate case between instantons (ASD connections on R4 ) and monopoles\n\n(translation invariant instantons). Complete constructions of instantons and monopoles\nhave been found: there is a complete construction of instantons from algebraic data,\nthe ADHM construction due to Atiyah and others, while Nahm gave a construction of\nmonopoles from solutions to a system of ODEs known as Nahm's equation. Both these\nconstructions can be thought of as generalizations of a correspondence between ASD\nconnections on the 4-torus, and ASD connections over the dual 4-torus, originally due to\nMukai and Braam-van Baal. This correspondence, often called the 'Nahm transform',\nis invertible and the inverse of the transform is the transform itself up to sign. Given\nan ASD connection on the 4-torus it is defined in terms of the kernel of a family of\nDirac operators parameterized by the dual torus. The aim of this thesis is to generalize\nthe Nahm transform to the caloron case. In particular, our approach is via analysis of\nthese families of Dirac operators rather than via twistor theory.\nWe start by exploring topological aspects of calorons and boundary conditions.\nThese are needed to ensure that the Dirac operators that define the Nahm transform\nare Fredholm. Our main innovation is to regard R3 as the interior of the closed 3-ball\n3\n\nB , and to stipulate fixed behaviour on the boundary, rather than imposing asymptotic\nboundary conditions. The boundary conditions for calorons can be stated as follows:\n3\n\ngiven a bundle on S 1 \u00d7 B we fix some gauge f on the boundary, and we require that\n\nin the gauge f , a U (n) caloron must resemble the pull-back of a U (n) monopole. There\n3\n\nis a topological obstruction to extending f to the interior of S 1 \u00d7 B , which we call the\n'instanton charge' of the caloron.\n\nThe Nahm transform of a caloron consists of a solution to Nahm's equation on S 1 ,\nwhich we refer to as Nahm data. Many aspects of the 4-torus transform generalize\nreadily to the caloron case, and the construction of calorons from Nahm data is very\nsimilar to the construction of monopoles. The main difficulty in the construction lies\nwith recovering the boundary conditions for the caloron and calculating its instanton\ncharge. The caloron constructed from a set of Nahm data is defined using a family of\nDirac operators \u2206(x) parameterized by x \u2208 S 1 \u00d7 R3 . Our approach is to deform \u2206(x)\n \u0303\nto some model \u2206(x)\nfor which we can recover the boundary conditions and calculate\nthe instanton charge. We then show that this deformation does not affect the behaviour\non the boundary. Thus we prove that every set of Nahm data on S 1 gives rise to a\ncaloron via the Nahm transform.\n\n\fGoing the other way, from the caloron to the Nahm data, we encounter two main\nproblems: first, we must calculate the rank of the Nahm data, which can jump at\nisolated points on S 1 ; and secondly, we must show that the Nahm data has certain\nprescribed singularities at these points. The transform is defined in terms of a family of\nDirac operators parameterized by S 1 . We show that the caloron boundary conditions\nensure this family of Dirac operators is Fredholm away from the prescribed points on\nS 1 . We also prove an index theorem for Dirac operators coupled to connections on\nS 1 \u00d7 R3 that allows us to calculate the rank of the Nahm data. We obtain partial\n\nresults concerning the behaviour of the Nahm data at singularities. These are based\non Nakajima's method for recovering the singularities in Nahm data constructed from\nSU(2) monopoles.\n\n2\n\n\fTo my parents.\n\n\fAcknowledgements\nI would like to thank my supervisor, Michael Singer, for all his help with this thesis,\nand for being so generous with his time.

One of\nthe original problems in the area, the construction of finite-action ASD connections on\nR4 , was solved in 1978 by Atiyah and others [5, 4]. They gave a complete construction\nof all such connections-the celebrated ADHM construction of instantons-by means\nof twistor theory and algebraic geometry. For the purposes of this introduction we\nwill call any anti-self-dual connection on R4 an instanton. Instantons are of great\ninterest to physicists, since they are solutions to the Yang-Mills equation in a gauge field\ntheory, and so represent minimum-energy configurations. They have had an important\nimpact on quantum chromodynamics (QCD), with applications to symmetry breaking,\ntunnelling, and confinement.\nIn fact the ADHM construction can be regarded as a special case of a correspondence\nwe will refer to as the Nahm transform. If \u039b \u2282 R4 is a sub-group of translations, and\n\u039b\u2217 \u2282 (R4 )\u2217 is the dual of \u039b (so that \u039b\u2217 consists of elements taking integer values on\n\n\u039b), then the Nahm transform is a correspondence between ASD connections on R4 /\u039b\n\nand ASD connections on (R4 )\u2217 /2\u03c0\u039b\u2217 . The details of the transform vary depending on\nthe nature of \u039b, and the existence and invertibility of the transform have been proved\nrigorously in several cases. For example, the case \u039b = {0} corresponds to the ADHM\nconstruction, as presented by Donaldson and Kronheimer [12].\n\nAnother area of interest to mathematicians and physicists alike is that of monopoles,\nwhich are solutions to the Bogomolny equation on R3 . The Bogomolny equation is\na translation reduction of the ASD equation, and so monopoles can be thought of\nas translation-invariant instantons, or equivalently, ASD connections on R4 /\u039b where\n\u039b = R. In this case, the Nahm transform is a correspondence between monopoles and\nobjects defined on the 'dual torus' (R4 )\u2217 /2\u03c0\u039b\u2217 = R, which we will refer to as Nahm\ndata. The construction of monopoles from Nahm data and the inverse correspondence\nhas been described by Hitchin [17] (for SU (2) monopoles) and Hurtubise\u2013Murray [20]\n(for arbitrary gauge group).\n4\n\n\fPeriodic connections on R4 correspond to \u039b = Z, and form an intermediate case\nbetween instantons and monopoles. A periodic anti-self-dual connection over R4 is\ncalled a periodic instanton, or caloron. The aim of this thesis is to study the geometry\nof calorons and the Nahm transform. Since \u039b = Z, the transform will be a correspondence between calorons lying on R4 /\u039b = S 1 \u00d7 R3 and Nahm data on (R4 )\u2217 /2\u03c0\u039b\u2217 = S 1 .\n\nIn some sense a caloron can be thought of as a hybrid between an instanton and a\nmonopole. For example, a caloron has an 'instanton charge' (an invariant that depends\non the 4-dimensional topology of the caloron) together with 'monopole charges' (which\ncharacterize the 3-dimensional topology). We will see this reflected in the Nahm transform for calorons, as it shares features with both the ADHM construction of instantons\nand the construction of monopoles. Originally introduced by Nahm in [33], the transform for calorons has been studied recently for calorons with unit instanton charge and\nzero monopole charges, in a series of papers [23, 24, 22] and [26].\nCompleteness of the ADHM construction of instantons and construction of monopoles was originally proved using twistor theory. In the case of monopoles, there is a\ncorrespondence between monopoles and certain algebraic curves in twistor space, called\nspectral curves, and this was used in [17] and [20] to go from monopoles to their Nahm\ndata. The twistor picture for calorons was studied in [13], and there is a similar correspondence between calorons and their spectral curves. While the twistor picture could\nbe used to prove the existence of the Nahm transform for calorons, the approach in\nthis thesis is via analysis of families of Dirac operators, regarding the caloron case as a\ngeneralization of the Nahm transform on the 4-torus.\nWith the scene set, we go on to introduce anti-self-duality and the Nahm transform\n\nmore formally in Section 1.1. In Section 1.2 we review existing work on calorons, before\ngiving an overview of the aims and results of this thesis in Section 1.3. From the outset,\nwe draw the reader's attention to the Glossary of Notation on page 135 in the hope it\nwill make the thesis easier to read.\n\n1.1\n1.1.1\n\nAnti-self-dual connections and the Nahm transform\nThe anti-self-duality equation on R4\n\nLet x0 , x1 , x2 , x3 be the standard coordinates on R4 , and equip R4 with the standard\nEuclidean inner product. Fix an orientation by decreeing that the ordered basis of\n1-forms dx0 , dx1 , dx2 , dx3 be positive. The space of p-forms on R4 is denoted \u039bp R4 ,\nand a p-form \u03b1 will be represented by its skew-symmetric covariant tensor \u03b1a1 ,a2 ,...,ap\nof components, defined by\n\u03b1=\n\n1 X\n\u03b1a1 ,a2 ,...,ap dxa1 \u2227 . . . \u2227 dxap .\np! a ,...,a\n1\n\np\n\n5\n\n\fIn general, the Hodge star operator is defined on any n-dimensional Riemannian manifold M with volume form \u03b7. It is the linear map \u2217 : \u039bp M \u2192 \u039bn\u2212p M defined pointwise\n\nby\n\nh\u03b1, \u03b2i\u03b7 = \u2217\u03b1 \u2227 \u03b2\nwhere \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 \u039bp M and h\u03b1, \u03b2i is the inner product between p-forms defined by the\n\nmetric. Integrating over the manifold M gives an inner product on forms defined\nglobally:\nh\u03b1, \u03b2i =\nOn R4 the Hodge star becomes\n\nZ\n\nM\n\nh\u03b1, \u03b2i\u03b7 =\n\nZ\n\nM\n\n\u2217\u03b1 \u2227 \u03b2.\n\n(1.1)\n\n\u2217 : \u039b2 R4 \u2212\u2192 \u039b2 R4\n1X\n(\u2217\u03b1)ab =\n\u01ebabcd \u03b1cd\n2\nc,d\n\nfor any 2-form \u03b1, where \u01ebabcd is the 4-dimensional alternating tensor with \u01eb0123 = 1.\nSince \u2217\u2217 = 1, \u2217 has eigenspaces with eigenvalues \u00b11. A 2-form \u03b1 is self-dual (SD) if\n\n\u2217\u03b1 = \u03b1 and anti-self-dual (ASD) if \u2217\u03b1 = \u2212\u03b1. In terms of components, \u03b1 is anti-self-dual\nif\n\n\u03b101 + \u03b123 = 0,\n\n\u03b102 + \u03b131 = 0,\n\nand \u03b103 + \u03b112 = 0.\n\n(1.2)\n\nGiven a connection A on a bundle E on R4 , A is anti-self-dual, or satisfies the anti-selfduality equation, if its curvature FA is anti-self-dual as an endomorphism-valued 2-form\ni.e. if\n\u2217FA = \u2212FA .\n\n(1.3)\n\nIf we consider the action of a discrete sub-group \u039b \u2282 R4 of translations on R4 , so\nthat R4 /\u039b is 4-dimensional, the anti-self-duality condition makes sense on the quotient\n\nmanifold R4 /\u039b. The ASD 2-forms are those that satisfy (1.2) where x0 , x1 , x2 , x3 are\nthe coordinates on R4 /\u039b corresponding to the standard coordinates on R4 . Note that\nthroughout we will use the symbols E, A etc. to refer to vector bundles and connections\nover 4-manifolds and the corresponding symbols E, A etc. to refer to vector bundles\nand connections over 3-manifolds.\nAn instanton is a unitary ASD connection A on R4 whose action\nZ\ntr \u2217 FA \u2227 FA\nkFA k2 =\nR4\n\nis finite. Uhlenbeck [40] showed that any such connection extends smoothly to the\ncompactification S 4 of R4 , and that every ASD connection on S 4 arises in this way.\nThus instantons really live on S 4 and are characterized by their second Chern class,\nwhich is often called the instanton number, or charge.\n6\n\n\f1.1.2\n\nTranslation reduction: the Bogomolny and Nahm equations\n\nNext, we define the Bogomolny equation and Nahm's equation, and show how these can\nbe thought of as translation reductions of the anti-self-duality equation. The Bogomolny\nequation applies to connections over R3 , and we need to fix the following conventions.\nThroughout, we will consider R3 as a slice of R4 of the form x0 = constant, oriented\nso that the ordered basis dx1 , dx2 , dx3 is positive. The Hodge star operator is given in\ncomponents by\n\u2217 : \u039b2 R3 \u2212\u2192 \u039b1 R3\n1X\n(\u2217\u03b1)a =\n\u01ebabc \u03b1bc\n2\nb,c\n\nwhere \u01ebabc is the 3-dimensional alternating tensor with \u01eb123 = 1. To distinguish between\nthe star operators on R3 and R4 we will sometimes write them as \u22173 and \u22174 .\n\nConsider what happens to the anti-self-duality equation (1.3) if we decree that\n\na connection A is translation invariant. Of course, this is equivalent to looking at\nconnections on the 'generalized torus' R4 /\u039b with \u039b = R, that satisfy a symmetry\nreduction of the ASD condition. Let A0 , A1 , A2 , A3 be the matrices representing A in\nsome global trivialisation of E, and suppose that the matrices are independent of x0 .\nThen, using (1.2) and (FA )ij = \u2202i Aj \u2212 \u2202j Ai + [Ai , Aj ], we see that FA is ASD iff\n\u22022 A3 \u2212 \u22023 A2 + [A2 , A3 ] = \u22021 A0 + [A1 , A0 ]\n\n(1.4)\n\nholds, together with the two equations obtained by cyclic permutations in {1, 2, 3}. Let\n\nE be a unitary bundle over R3 with some fixed trivialisation. From this point on we\nwill restrict to unitary bundles for the rest of the thesis. Let A be the connection on E\nwith components A1 , A2 , A3 in this trivialisation and let \u03a6 be the endomorphism of E\nrepresented by A0 . Then (1.4) and its cyclic permutations can be written as\n\u2217FA = \u2207A \u03a6.\n\n(1.5)\n\nThis is the Bogomolny equation. Note that conversely, any solution to the Bogomolny\nequation can be used to construct a translation invariant ASD connection on R4 via\nthe same argument. The endomorphism \u03a6 is called a Higgs field.\nA monopole is a unitary solution (A, \u03a6) to the Bogomolny equation whose energy\nZ\n2\n2\ntr {\u2217FA \u2227 FA + \u2217\u2207A \u03a6 \u2227 \u2207A \u03a6}\nkFA k + k\u2207A \u03a6k =\nR3\n\nis finite. The finite energy condition can be re-expressed in terms of the asymptotic\nbehaviour of A and \u03a6. For SU (2) monopoles the asymptotic condition is that k\u03a6k \u2192 \u03bc\n\nas r \u2192 \u221e where r is the standard polar coordinate on R3 . (In fact there are additional\n\nconditions that will not concern us till later.) On the 2-sphere at infinity \u03a6 therefore\n7\n\n\fhas eigenvalues \u00b1i\u03bc, defining two eigenbundles. We let \u00b1k be the first Chern classes\n\nof these eigenbundles, and say that the monopole (A, \u03a6) has charge k. Note that\ninstantons cannot be translation invariant, since this would contradict the finite action\ncondition.\nWe can perform further translation reduction: consider an ASD connection A on\n\nR4\n\nwhose components A0 , A1 , A2 , A3 are independent of x1 , x2 , x3 in some trivialisation.\n\nThe anti-self-duality equation becomes\n\u22020 A1 + [A0 , A1 ] + [A2 , A3 ] = 0\n\n(1.6)\n\nplus cyclic permutations in {1, 2, 3}. In a similar way to the reduction to the monopole\n\ncase above, A determines a connection \u2207 and three endomorphisms T1 , T2 , T3 on a\nvector bundle over R; from (1.6) we see that these satisfy\n\u2207Ti +\n\n1X\n\u01ebijk [Tj , Tk ] = 0.\n2\n\n(1.7)\n\nj,k\n\nThis is Nahm's equation. Following the sketch of the Nahm transform at the start of\nthe Chapter, we expect solutions to Nahm's equation to correspond to solutions of the\nBogomolny equation under the transform.\n\n1.1.3\n\nGauge transformations\n\nMonopoles and instantons are studied modulo the action of the group of bundle automorphisms preserving the base manifold. These automorphisms are referred to as gauge\ntransformations. In particular, the Nahm transform is defined modulo this gauge action. If local trivialisations are fixed, the action of a gauge transformation is the same\nas a change of trivialisation. We therefore sometimes refer to fixing a local trivialisation\nas 'fixing a gauge'.\nFor an instanton A on a U (n) bundle E \u2192 R4 , a gauge transformation g acts on\n\nsections of E by s 7\u2192 gs and on A by \u2207A 7\u2192 g\u2207g \u22121 . In a local trivialisation over\n\nsome open region U \u2282 R4 , g becomes a map g : U \u2192 U (n) and \u2207A is represented by\nmatrix-valued functions A0 , A1 , A2 , A3 : U \u2192 u(n). The action of g is given by\nAa 7\u2192 gAa g\u22121 \u2212 dgg\u22121 .\nSimilarly, for a monopole (A, \u03a6) on a U (n) bundle E \u2192 R3 , a gauge transformation g\n\nacts on sections of E by s 7\u2192 gs, on A by \u2207A 7\u2192 g\u2207A g \u22121 , and on \u03a6 by \u03a6 7\u2192 g\u03a6g \u22121 . In\n\na local trivialisation over some open region U \u2282 R3 , g becomes a map g : U \u2192 U (n),\n\n\u03a6 becomes a map \u03a6 : U \u2192 u(n), and \u2207A is represented by A1 , A2 , A3 : U \u2192 u(n). The\naction of g on \u03a6 is given by\n\n\u03a6 7\u2192 g\u03a6g \u22121\n8\n\n\fand on A by\nAa 7\u2192 gAa g\u22121 \u2212 dgg\u22121 .\nGauge transformations for bundles over the 4-torus and over S 1 \u00d7 R3 are defined in an\n\nanalogous way.\n\n1.1.4\n\nSpin structures and Dirac operators\n\nThe Nahm transform is defined using Dirac operators on R4 /\u039b. In this Section we fix\nour notation and conventions for such operators. We start, however, by recalling the\ndefinition of a spin structure on an arbitrary manifold. References [12], [39] and [14]\nprovide more background material, and proofs of all the statements.\nSuppose M is an oriented smooth n-dimensional Riemannian manifold. Let F be\nthe principal SO(n) bundle of oriented orthogonal frames for the tangent bundle. A\nspin structure for M is a pair (F\u0303 , \u03c3) where F\u0303 is a principal Spin(n)-bundle over M ,\nand \u03c3 : F\u0303 \u2192 F is a two-to-one covering such that the restriction to each fibre is the\n\ndouble covering Spin(n) \u2192 SO(n). The obstruction to the existence of a spin structure\nis the second Stiefel-Whitney class, which is contained in H 2 (M, Z2 ) (see [12, Section\n\n1.1.4]), and the number of spin structures is counted by H 1 (M, Z2 ). If a spin structure\nexists then M is called a spin manifold. The spin bundle S \u2192 M is defined to be the\nvector bundle associated to the Spin(n) principal bundle F\u0303 via the spin representation.\n\nIt comes equipped with a representation \u03b3 of the Clifford algebra of the tangent space\nTx M on the fibre Sx for each x \u2208 M , and this is used to define the Dirac operator.\n\nWhen M = R4 , it is easy to check that there is a unique spin structure. Since\n\nSpin(4) = SU (2) \u00d7 SU (2) it follows that the spin bundle S decomposes into two SU (2)\n\nbundles S + , S \u2212 with S = S + \u2295 S \u2212 (see [12, Section 3.1.1]). The spin representa-\n\ntion \u03b3 respects this decomposition in the following way. Given the orthonormal frame\n(\u2202x0 , \u2202x1 , \u2202x2 , \u2202x3 ) the endomorphisms \u03b3(\u2202xa ) : S \u2192 S decompose as\n\u0013\n\u0012\n0 \u03b3a\u2217\n: S+ \u2295 S\u2212 \u2192 S+ \u2295 S\u2212,\n\u03b3(\u2202xa ) =\n\u03b3a 0\nfor a = 0, 1, 2, 3. Since \u03b3 is a representation of the Clifford algebra these endomorphisms\nsatisfy\n\u03b3a\u2217 \u03b3b + \u03b3b\u2217 \u03b3a = 2\u03b4ab .\n\n(1.8)\n\nIn particular, we can choose bases for S + and S \u2212 in which the endomorphisms are\ngiven by matrices\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 0\n\u03b30 =\n,\n0 1\n\n\u03b31 =\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\ni 0\n,\n0 \u2212i\n\n\u03b32 =\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n0 \u22121\n,\n1 0\n\n\u03b33 =\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n0 i\n.\ni 0\n\n(1.9)\n\nNote that these satisfy\n\u03b3i\u2217 = \u2212\u03b3i , and \u03b3i \u03b3j = \u2212\u03b3k ,\n9\n\n(1.10)\n\n\fwhere {i, j, k} is a cyclic permutation of {1, 2, 3}. Let \u2207 be the covariant differential\n\noperator on some bundle E \u2192 R4 associated to some unitary connection A, and let\n\n\u22070 , \u22071 , \u22072 , \u22073 be its components in the frame (\u2202x0 , \u2202x1 , \u2202x2 , \u2202x3 ). The Dirac operators\nDA+ : \u0393(S + \u2297 E) \u2192 \u0393(S \u2212 \u2297 E) and DA\u2212 : \u0393(S \u2212 \u2297 E) \u2192 \u0393(S + \u2297 E)\n\n(1.11)\n\nare defined by\nDA+ s\n\n=\n\n3\nX\na=0\n\nand\n\nDA\u2212 s = \u2212\n\n\u03b3a \u2207a s\n\n3\nX\na=0\n\n(1.12)\n\n\u03b3a\u2217 \u2207a s,\n\n(1.13)\n\nand are called the Dirac operators coupled to the bundle E via the connection A.\nNext consider the two cases M = R4 /\u039b where \u039b = Z or Z4 (i.e. M = S 1 \u00d7 R3 or\n\nM = T 4 ). The spin bundle and spin representation \u03b3 are invariant under the action of\n\u039b, and so descend to the quotient. Thus in both cases M has a spin bundle S = S + \u2295S \u2212 ,\ntogether with Dirac operators defined by equations (1.11)\u2013(1.13).\n\nThe following Weitzenb\u00f6ck formula holds on M = R4 , S 1 \u00d7 R3 , and T 4 :\nLemma 1.14.

In this case the spin bundle is a Spin(3) = SU (2)\nbundle which we denote S(3) . We can find a trivialisation of S(3) in which the spin\nrepresentation \u03b3(\u2202j ) for j = 1, 2, 3 is given by \u03b3j , where the \u03b3j are defined by (1.9).\nGiven a unitary bundle E over R3 and a unitary connection A on E, the Dirac operator\ncoupled to A is defined by\nDA : \u0393(S(3) \u2297 E) \u2192 \u0393(S(3) \u2297 E)\nDA =\n\n3\nX\nj=1\n\n\u03b3j \u2207j .\n\nNote that we will often want to use identifications\nS\u2212 \u223c\n= \u03c0 \u2217 S(3) ,\n\nS+ \u223c\n= \u03c0 \u2217 S(3) ,\n\n(1.16)\n\nwhere \u03c0 is the projection \u03c0 : R4 \u2192 R3 or \u03c0 : S 1 \u00d7 R3 \u2192 R3 .\n\n1.1.5\n\nThe Nahm transform on the 4-torus\n\nAs described on page 4, the Nahm transform is a correspondence between ASD connections on R4 /\u039b and ASD connections on (R4 )\u2217 /2\u03c0\u039b\u2217 , where \u039b \u2282 R4 is a group of\n\ntranslations. The Nahm transform on the 4-torus (when \u039b = Z4 ) is in some ways the\nmost natural version, and the other cases of the transform can be regarded as generalizations of the 4-torus version. In this Section we present the Nahm transform on T 4\nfollowing Braam-van Baal [6] and Donaldson-Kronheimer [12, Section 3.2]; later, we\nwill use this as the framework into which the other cases fit, in particular the transform\nfor calorons.\nLet \u039b be a maximal lattice in R4 and let T = R4 /\u039b. As before, the dual lattice \u039b\u2217\nconsists of elements of (R4 )\u2217 taking integer values on \u039b, and we define the dual torus\nto be T \u2217 = (R4 )\u2217 /2\u03c0\u039b\u2217 . We equip T \u2217 with the flat Riemannian metric induced from\n(R4 )\u2217 , and denote the spin bundles \u015c \u00b1 . Note that if \u039b is generated by {\u03bc0 e0 , . . . , \u03bc3 e3 }\n\nwhere \u03bca \u2208 R and e0 , . . . , e3 is the standard basis of R4 then T \u2217 has periods 2\u03c0/\u03bca for\n\na = 0, 1, 2, 3.\n\nThe dual torus T \u2217 parameterizes flat U (1) connections on T in the following way.\nAny \u03be \u2208 (R4 )\u2217 can be regarded as a 1-form with constant coefficients on T via \u03be 7\u2192\nP\n\u03bea dxa . The connection d \u2212 i\u03be on the trivial line bundle C \u00d7 T is flat, and we denote\nthe line bundle with this connection by L\u03be . Two points \u03be1 , \u03be2 \u2208 (R4 )\u2217 determine gauge\nequivalent connections iff there is a well-defined gauge transformation g satisfying\ni(\u03be1 \u2212 \u03be2 ) = dgg\u22121\n\u21d4\n\ng(x) = exp i(\u03be1 \u2212 \u03be2 ) * x\n\n11\n\n(1.17)\n\n\fwhere x is the coordinate on R4 . The map g is a well-defined gauge transformation\ng : T \u2192 U (1) iff \u03be1 \u2212\u03be2 \u2208 2\u03c0\u039b\u2217 . Thus L\u03be1 and L\u03be2 are gauge equivalent iff \u03be1 \u2212\u03be2 \u2208 2\u03c0\u039b\u2217 ,\n\nand T \u2217 parameterizes gauge equivalence classes of flat U (1) connections on T .\n\nNext, fix a unitary vector bundle E over T with a unitary ASD connection A. We\nrestrict to connections that are 'irreducible' in the following sense (the definition is\ntaken directly from [12]):\nDefinition 1.18. The connection A is WFF (without flat factors) if there is no splitting\nE = E\u2032 \u2295 L\u03be compatible with A for any flat line bundle L\u03be .\nFor each \u03be \u2208 (R4 )\u2217 we can consider the bundle E\u03be = E \u2297 L\u03be equipped with the\n\ninduced connection A\u03be . Using some fixed trivialisation of E, A\u03be is represented by\nA \u2297 1 \u2212 1 \u2297 i\u03be where (by abuse of notation) A is a matrix of 1-forms. It is easy to check\nthat A\u03be is ASD for all \u03be. We can write down the Dirac operators on T coupled to E\u03be\nvia A\u03be , following definitions (1.11)\u2013(1.13):\nD\u03be\u00b1 : \u0393(S \u00b1 \u2297 E \u2297 L\u03be ) \u2192 \u0393(S \u2213 \u2297 E \u2297 L\u03be )\nwhere\nD\u03be\u2212 = DA\u2212 + i\u03b3 \u2217 (\u03be),\n\nD\u03be+ = DA+ \u2212 i\u03b3(\u03be),\n\n(1.19)\n\nand \u03b3 is the spin representation for R4 . Since A\u03be is ASD, applying Lemma 1.14 we have\nD\u03be\u2212 D\u03be+ = \u2207\u2217A\u03be \u2207A\u03be .\nThus s \u2208 ker D\u03be+ iff k\u2207A\u03be sk = 0, in which case s is a covariant constant section of\n\nE \u2297 L\u03be , and, if non-trivial, yields a splitting E = E\u2032 \u2295 L\u2217\u03be . Since we are assuming that\nA is WFF it follows that D\u03be+ is injective.\n\nVia standard results on elliptic operators, D\u03be+ is Fredholm for all \u03be \u2208 T \u2217 and has\n\nconstant L2 -index. Since D\u03be+ is injective, using the Fredholm alternative it follows that\n\ndim ker D\u03be\u2212 = \u2212index D\u03be+ and this is independent of \u03be. Moreover, the fibres \u00ca\u03be =\n\ncoker D\u03be+ = ker D\u03be\u2212 define a vector bundle \u00ca over (R4 )\u2217 which inherits an hermitian\nmetric from the L2 hermitian metric on \u0393(S \u2212 \u2297 E). Let F\u0302 be the bundle over (R4 )\u2217\n\nwhose fibre at \u03be consists of L2 sections of S \u2212 \u2297 E \u2297 L\u03be so that \u00ca is a sub-bundle of F\u0302,\nand let P\u0302\u03be be the L2 orthogonal projection onto ker D\u03be\u2212 . Let P\u0302 be the map on F\u0302 given\n\nfibrewise by P\u0302\u03be . Using the standard covariant derivative d on the trivial bundle F\u0302, we\ncan define a unitary connection \u00c2 on \u00ca by\n\u2207\u00c2 = P\u0302 * d.\nFinally, note that\n\u2212\n= (exp i\u03b7 * x)D\u03be\u2212 (exp \u2212i\u03b7 * x)\nD\u03be+\u03b7\n\n12\n\n(1.20)\n\n\ffor all \u03b7 \u2208 2\u03c0\u039b\u2217 so that (exp i\u03b7 * x) : T \u2192 U (1) is a gauge transformation identifying\n\n\u2212\n. Hence 2\u03c0\u039b\u2217 acts on \u00ca \u2192 (R4 )\u2217 , and the quotient is a bundle\nker D\u03be\u2212 with ker D\u03be+\u03b7\n\nover T \u2217 , which we also denote \u00ca. The connection \u00c2 respects this action and descends\nto a connection over T \u2217 in the same way.\nDefinition 1.21. If A is a unitary WFF ASD connection on a unitary bundle E \u2192 T\n\nthen (\u00ca, \u00c2) is called the Nahm transform of (E, A), where \u00ca \u2192 T \u2217 is given fibrewise by\n\n\u00ca\u03be = coker D\u03be+ and \u00c2 is defined by (1.20).\n\nThe transform is non-trivial, in that, when c1 (E) = 0, the rank and Chern classes\nof \u00ca are given by:\nrank(\u00ca) = c2 (E)\nc1 (\u00ca) = 0\nc2 (\u00ca) = rank(E).\n(When c1 (E) 6= 0 there is a very similar formula.) The relations are a direct result of\n\nthe index theorem for families due to Atiyah-Singer, and a proof is given in [12, Section\n3.2.2].\nThe key point is the following:\nProposition 1.22. The Nahm transform (\u00ca, \u00c2) of (E, A) is ASD.\nProof: The curvature F\u00c2 of \u00c2 is given by\nF\u00c2 = P\u0302 dP\u0302 dP\u0302 P\u0302 ,\nwhere P\u0302 is the L2 -projection onto ker D\u03be\u2212 at each point \u03be \u2208 T \u2217 . Now\nP\u0302\u03be = 1 \u2212 D\u03be+ G\u03be D\u03be\u2212\nwhere\nG\u03be = (D\u03be\u2212 D\u03be+ )\u22121 .\nSubstituting this into the expression for F\u00c2 we obtain\nF\u00c2 = P\u0302 (dD\u03be+ )G(dD\u03be\u2212 )P\u0302 .\nFrom (1.19), we have\ndD\u03be+ = \u2212i\n\nX\n\n\u03b3a d\u03bea\n\nand dD\u03be\u2212 = i\n\na\n\nX\nb\n\nSince\nX\nX\n(\n\u03b3a d\u03bea ) \u2227 (\n\u03b3b\u2217 d\u03beb )\na\n\nb\n\n13\n\n\u03b3b\u2217 d\u03beb .\n\n\fis ASD (which can be checked by substituting in the matrices \u03b3a from (1.9) and comparing with the anti-self-duality equation), it follows that \u00c2 is ASD provided G\u03be commutes\n\u2212 +\nwith Clifford multiplication for all \u03be. But Lemma 1.14 shows that G\u22121\n\u03be = D\u03be D\u03be com-\n\nmutes with Clifford multiplication, so the Proposition follows.\n\n\u2737\n\nAnother remarkable property of the Nahm transform is that-like the Fourier\ntransform-it is invertible, and the inverse is the transform itself (up to factors of\n2\u03c0 and sign). It turns out that given an ASD WFF connection (E, A), not only is \u00c2\nASD, but it is also WFF, so the transform can be applied again to (\u00ca, \u00c2). The inverse\ntransform is defined in the following way.\nJust as T \u2217 parameterizes the flat line bundles on T , the torus T parameterizes flat\nP\nline bundles over T \u2217 via the identification x 7\u2192 d \u2212 i xa d\u03bea . We write L\u0302x to denote\n\nthe line bundle and flat connection corresponding to x \u2208 T , and, given a unitary bundle\n\nF and unitary connection B over T \u2217 , let Dx\u00b1 be the Dirac operators coupled to F \u2297 L\u0302x\n\nvia B twisted by L\u0302x :\n\nDx\u00b1 : \u0393(\u015c \u00b1 \u2297 F \u2297 L\u0302x ) \u2192 \u0393(\u015c \u2213 \u2297 F \u2297 L\u0302x ).\nIf B is WFF and ASD then the inverse Nahm transform, (F\u030c, B\u030c), is defined entirely\nanalogously to the original transform, so that F\u030c has fibre ker Dx\u2212 for each x \u2208 T .\nTheorem 1.23. If A is a WFF ASD unitary connection on E \u2192 T then \u00c2 is WFF.\nHence (\u02c7\u00ca, \u02c7\u00c2) is well defined and there is a natural isomorphism \u03c9 : \u02c7\u00ca \u2192 E such that\n\u03c9 \u2217 (A) = \u02c7\u00c2.\nThe analogy with the Fourier transform for functions on Rn is obvious-indeed\nDonaldson-Kronheimer call the Nahm transform the 'Fourier transform for ASD connections'.\nThere are two approaches to proving the Theorem, as described by Braam-van Baal\n[6] and Donaldson-Kronheimer [12] respectively. The first approaches uses relations\nbetween harmonic spinors on T and harmonic spinors on T \u2217 . Given an ASD connection\nA and its transform \u00c2, there is an elegant relation between the Greens function \u011cx of\nDx\u2212 Dx+ on T \u2217 and solutions \u03c8\u03be (x) to D\u03be\u2212 on T . The Greens function \u011cx is given very\nexplicitly, and it follows quite readily that \u00c2 is WFF. There is also a formula expressing\nthe solutions \u03c8\u0302x (\u03be) to Dx\u2212 on T \u2217 in terms of the solutions \u03c8\u03be (x) to D\u03be\u2212 . Using these\ntwo relations one constructs the desired isometry \u03c9 : \u02c7\u00ca \u2192 E. The second approach to\n\nthe Theorem is to convert the problem into an equivalent one in holomorphic geometry\n \u0304\nthat can be solved using \u2202-cohomology\nand spectral sequences. ASD connections on\n\nT are characterized by the following: a unitary connection A on a unitary bundle E is\nASD if and only if it defines a holomorphic structure on E for each complex structure\non T . There is also an identification between the spaces of forms \u03a90,0 \u2295 \u03a90,2 , and\n14\n\n\f\u03a90,1 over T with the spin bundles S + , S \u2212 . This characterization allows one to move\n \u0304\nbetween ASD connections on unitary bundles and \u2202-operators\non holomorphic bundles.\nThe holomorphic version of the transform was first given by Mukai [30]; DonaldsonKronheimer also give a proof of the holomorphic version together with the details of\nhow to move between ASD connections and holomorphic bundles.\nRemarks\n(1) In algebraic geometry the transform of Mukai between holomorphic bundles over\ncomplex tori has been generalized to give the 'Fourier-Mukai' transform-a transform\nbetween bundles over algebraic varieties (e.g. elliptic surfaces, K3 surfaces). This has\nbeen very successful in the study of moduli spaces of bundles over these surfaces.\n(2) The Nahm transform is a hyperK\u00e4hler isometry between the moduli spaces M(E)\n\nand M(\u00ca) of WFF ASD connections on E and \u00ca. The moduli spaces are smooth\n\nmanifolds away from the connections with flat factors and are equipped with natural\nmetrics, given by the L2 metrics on 1-forms over T and T \u2217 . The ASD equation implies\nthat these metrics are hyperK\u00e4hler. Braam-van Baal [6] prove the Nahm transform on\nthe 4-torus is a hyperK\u00e4hler isometry. It is conjectured that this holds for the transform\nfor other cases of \u039b, and this has been proved in certain cases.\nThis concludes our description of the Nahm transform on T 4 . Next we consider the\ntransform when \u039b is a general group of translations, reviewing the cases that have been\nstudied in the literature.\n\n1.1.6\n\nThe Nahm transform on the generalized torus\n\nWe want to consider the 'generalized torus' T = R4 /\u039b where \u039b = \u03bb0 \u00d7 \u03bb1 \u00d7 \u03bb2 \u00d7 \u03bb3\n\nand \u03bba = {0}, Z, or R for each a = 0, . . . , 3. It can be thought of as the limit of\n\nthe 4-torus with generators {\u03bc0 e0 , . . . , \u03bc3 e3 } \u2282 R4 where some of the \u03bca tend to zero\n\nor infinity. Recall that the dual torus has periods 2\u03c0/\u03bca , so 'shrinking' \u03bca to zero\n(i.e. taking \u03bba = R) corresponds to 'stretching' a period on the dual torus (i.e. taking\n\u03bb\u2217a = {0} where \u039b\u2217 = \u03bb\u22170 \u00d7 . . . \u00d7 \u03bb\u22173 ) and vice versa. Given some generalized torus,\n\none can attempt to carry across all the theory in Section 1.1.5 to give a version of the\nNahm transform in this new setting. Many aspects carry across readily, but two main\nproblems are encountered:\n1. In all cases other than the 4-torus we can assume T is non-compact (since if T\nis compact then T \u2217 must be non-compact and we can swap the two around). It\nbecomes necessary to impose boundary conditions at infinity on the connection\nA to ensure that D\u03be+ is Fredholm-and even with these conditions D\u03be+ may fail\nto be Fredholm for certain values of \u03be. The Nahm data will contain singularities\nat the points where D\u03be+ is not Fredholm. In fact \u00ca will not in general be a single\n15\n\n\fvector bundle, but may change rank at these singular points. This introduces a\nnew element into the problem: one must give boundary conditions for A and \u00c2\nat infinity and singular points, and then show that these can be recovered from\neach direction of the transform.\n2. A related problem is that the index theorem for families relating the topology\nof E and \u00ca does not hold on non-compact manifolds or for singular connections.\nFurthermore, while index theorems on non-compact manifolds do exist in the\nliterature, they depend heavily on the precise nature of the geometry at infinity.\nIt may therefore be necessary to prove a new index theorem depending on \u039b and\nthe nature of the boundary conditions being imposed, for each different case of\nthe transform.\nVarious cases of the transform on the generalized torus exist in the literature, and\nwe review these next. We describe the constructions of instantons and monopoles in\nsome detail, as these cases are directly relevant to the caloron case, but delay commenting on the literature until Section 1.1.7. We let T n denote the n-torus S 1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 S 1 .\nThe case T = R4 , T \u2217 = {0}: the ADHM construction of instantons. A de-\n\nscription of the ADHM construction as a generalization of the Nahm transform on the\n4-torus is given in [12, Chapter 3]. We give a brief sketch of the construction, comparing\nwith what you might expect na\u0131\u0308vely from the 4-torus transform.\nLet (E, A) be an instanton with charge k (recall the definition in Section 1.1.1).\nThere is a unique flat line bundle over R4 and the dual torus T \u2217 is a single point, so\nto perform the Nahm transform we consider only the Dirac operator DA+ rather than\n\nthe family of operators D\u03be+ . The boundary condition on (E, A) (i.e. the assumption\nthat the instanton extends to the compactification S 4 ) allows the Atiyah-Singer index\ntheorem to be applied. This shows that DA+ is Fredholm with index \u2212k, so \u00ca is just the\n\nk-dimensional vector space coker DA+ . In analogy with the transform for T 4 , we expect\n\n\u00c2 to be an ASD connection over R4 invariant under any translation. This would be\nrepresented by skew-hermitian endomorphisms\nTa s = iP\u0302 (xa s)\n\n(1.24)\n\n[T0 , T1 ] + [T2 , T3 ] = 0\n\n(1.25)\n\nfor s \u2208 coker DA+ , satisfying\n\nand cyclic permutations in {1, 2, 3} (the fully translation invariant ASD equation). In\n\nfact when we perform the transform, the RHS of equation (1.25) turns out to be nonzero. This 'surprise' arises as a direct result of the non-compactness of R4 .\n16\n\n\fThe correct dual picture is the following. Let\nX \u0012 \u03bba \u0013\n\u2206(x) =\n\u2297 \u03b3a : Ck \u2297 \u015c + \u2192 Ck+1 \u2297 \u015c \u2212\nTa \u2212 ixa\n\n(1.26)\n\na\n\nwhere Ta is a k \u00d7 k skew-hermitian matrix and \u03bba a rank k row vector, for a = 0, . . . , 3.\n\nThe map \u2206(x) is the analogue of the Dirac operator Dx+ . Under the assumptions\n\u2206(x) is injective for all x, and\n\u2206\u2217 (x)\u2206(x) commutes with the \u03b3 matrices for all x,\n\n(1.27)\n\ncoker \u2206(x) defines an SU (2) bundle E over R4 as x varies. This has c2 (E) = k, and an\nanalogue of Proposition 1.22 shows that the induced connection A is ASD. Atiyah and\nothers [5, 4] proved that every SU (2) instanton can be constructed in this way-this is\nthe ADHM construction. Expanding (1.27) gives\n[T0 , T1 ] + [T2 , T3 ] = (\u03bb\u22170 \u03bb1 \u2212 \u03bb\u22171 \u03bb0 ) + (\u03bb\u22172 \u03bb3 \u2212 \u03bb\u22173 \u03bb2 )\nand cyclic permutations in {1, 2, 3}; this is the correct version of equation (1.25). To\nobtain the ADHM data {Ta , \u03bba : a = 0, . . . , 3} from a given instanton (E, A) one must\n\nconsider the Nahm transform less na\u0131\u0308vely than we did above. Careful analysis of the\nasymptotic behaviour of the solutions in coker DA+ can be used to obtain the \u03bba .\nThe case T = R3 , T \u2217 = R: the construction of monopoles. The following sketch\nof the Nahm transform for SU (2) monopoles as a generalization of the transform on\nthe 4-torus follows Nakajima [34]. We comment on other approaches in the literature\nin Section 1.1.7.\nWe have already seen how a translation invariant anti-self-dual connection A is\nequivalent to a solution (A, \u03a6) of the Bogomolny equation. We can perform a similar\nreduction on the Dirac operator D\u03be+ . Using the identifications 1.16, D\u03be+ reduces to\nD\u03be = DA + \u03a6 \u2212 i\u03be : \u0393(S(3) \u2297 E) \u2192 \u0393(S(3) \u2297 E)\n\n(1.28)\n\nwhere \u03be \u2208 R is the coordinate on the dual torus. The rank of the Nahm transform is\n\ngiven by the dimension of the cokernel of D\u03be .\n\nAn important r\u00f4le will be played in this thesis by Callias' index theorem [7], which\ngives a formula for the index of operators like D\u03be on odd dimensional manifolds. The\noriginal version of the theorem applied to operators on bundles over M = Rm for odd m,\nbut was generalized by Anghel [3] and R\u00e5de [38] to apply more widely. The generalized\nversion applies to operators of the form\nDA,\u03a6 = DA + 1 \u2297 \u03a6 : C \u221e (M, S \u2297 E) \u2192 C \u221e (M, S \u2297 E)\nwhere M is a complete open odd-dimensional spin manifold with spin bundle S; E is\na unitary vector bundle on M ; DA is the Dirac-operator coupled to E via a unitary\n17\n\n\fconnection A; and \u03a6 is a skew-adjoint endomorphism of E. The main condition required\nis that \u03a6 should be invertible outside some compact set M0 \u2282 M and on the boundary\n\u2202M0 (some mild additional conditions are also required). If this is the case, then \u03a6\ndecomposes E|\u2202M0 as a direct sum E|\u2202M0 = E + \u2295 E \u2212 where E + consists of eigenvectors\n\nof \u2212i\u03a6 that have positive eigenvalue, and E \u2212 consists of eigenvectors with negative\n\neigenvalue.\n\nTheorem (Callias-Anghel-R\u00e5de). Under the assumptions above, DA,\u03a6 is Fredholm\nwith L2 -index given by\nind DA,\u03a6 = \u2212\n\nZ\n\n\u2202M0\n\n\u00c2(\u2202M0 ) \u2227 ch(E + )\n\n(1.29)\n\nwhere ch denotes the Chern character of a bundle and \u00c2 is the \u00c2-genus. (See [39,\nChapter 2] for background on characteristic classes and genera.)\nReturning to the operator D\u03be defined by (1.28), we want to apply Callias' theorem\nto compute its index. Suppose that (A, \u03a6) satisfies the SU (2) monopole boundary\ncondition, so that at infinity \u03a6 has eigenvalues \u00b1i\u03bc defining eigenbundles with Chern\nclasses \u00b1k. Since the \u00c2-genus of the two sphere is trivial, (1.29) gives\n2\nind D\u03be = \u2212c1 (E + )[SR\n]\n2 for all sufficiently large R. Here E + is the eigenbundle\nprovided \u03a6\u2212i\u03be is invertible on SR\n2 on which \u2212i(\u03a6 \u2212 i\u03be) is positive, c denotes the first Chern class, and S 2 is the\nover SR\n1\nR\n\n2-sphere with radius R. Since this result is independent of R we can take the limit as\n\n2 ]. When \u03be > \u03bc, E + is trivial so the index\nR \u2192 \u221e, and write ind D\u03be = \u2212c1 (E + )[S\u221e\n2 , so the index is zero\nis zero; when \u03be < \u2212\u03bc, E + is the whole vector bundle over SR\n\nagain; and when \u03bc > \u03be > \u2212\u03bc, E + is the eigenbundle with Chern class k so the index is\n\n\u2212k. A Weitzenb\u00f6ck formula like Lemma 1.14 shows that D\u03be is injective, so the Nahm\ntransform of (A, \u03a6) consists of a bundle \u00ca over the interval (\u2212\u03bc, \u03bc) \u2282 R with rank k.\n\nThe analogue of \u00c2 is a connection \u2207 and skew-adjoint endomorphisms T1 , T2 , T3 on\n\n\u00ca defined by\n\n\u2207s = P\u0302 (\u2202\u03be s)\nTj s = iP\u0302 (xj s),\n\n(1.30)\nj = 1, 2, 3\n\n(1.31)\n\nfor a family s(\u03be) \u2208 coker D\u03be . These satisfy Nahm's equation (1.7). Near the singularities \u03be = \u00b1\u03bc there is a parallel gauge in which the Tj have a simple pole:\nTj (\u03be) =\n\nRj\u00b1\n\u03be\u00b1\u03bc\n\n+ analytic function,\n\nand at each singularity the residues Rj\u00b1 define an irreducible representation of su(2)\nwith dimension k.\n18\n\n\fConversely, given such a connection \u2207 and endomorphisms Tj on a rank k bundle\n\n\u00ca \u2192 (\u2212\u03bc, \u03bc), the analogue of Dx+ is the operator\n\u2206(x) = \u2207 +\n\n3\nX\nj=1\n\nTj \u2297 \u03b3j \u2212 i\n\n3\nX\nj=1\n\nxj \u2297 \u03b3j : \u0393(\u00ca \u2297 \u015c + ) \u2192 \u0393(\u00ca \u2297 \u015c \u2212 )\n\n(1.32)\n\nfor x \u2208 R3 . Nahm's equation implies \u2206 is injective, and the singularity condition\n\nimplies that \u2206 has index \u22122, so coker \u2206(x) is a rank 2 bundle over R3 . We then define\n\u2207A s = P (ds)\n\u03a6s = iP (\u03bes)\n\nwhere s(x) \u2208 coker \u2206(x) for each x. An analogue of Proposition 1.22 shows (A, \u03a6) satis-\n\nfies the Bogomolny equation (1.5), and the monopole also satisfies the SU (2) monopole\nboundary condition with eigenvalues \u00b1i\u03bc and charge k.\nThe case T = T 1 \u00d7 R3 , T \u2217 = T 1 : calorons. Existing work on the transform for\ncalorons is reviewed in Section 1.2.\n\nThe case T = T 2 \u00d7 R2 , T \u2217 = T 2 . Jardim [21] has recently proved the existence and\n\ninvertibility of the transform for this case. The transform takes instantons on T 2 \u00d7 R2\n\nsatisfying certain decay conditions to solutions of the so-called Hitchin equations on T 2\nwith point singularities. The proof has a strong algebro-geometric flavour by regarding\nT as a complex manifold T 2 \u00d7 C, and in broad terms follows the proof of the transform\n\non T 4 in [12, Chapter 3].\n\nThe case T = T 3 \u00d7 R, T \u2217 = T 3 . Van Baal [41, 42] has studied instantons on T 3 \u00d7 R\n\nand the Nahm transform, in particular with 'twisted boundary conditions' (conditions\non every half period, as well as full periodicity).\n\n1.1.7\n\nNotes on the literature for the Nahm transform\n\nIn Section 1.1.6 we presented the constructions of instantons and monopoles as generalizations of the Nahm transform on the 4-torus. Historically, this is not how these\nconstructions arose-in this Section we describe approaches to the Nahm transform for\ninstantons and monopoles as they occurred in the literature.\nThe ADHM construction of instantons [5] arose from developments in twistor theory\nin the late 1970's. Ward [43] proved a correspondence between instantons on S 4 and\ncertain holomorphic bundles on the twistor space P3 (C) of S 4 . In turn, the ADHM\nconstruction [5] was a complete construction of these bundles, thereby giving a complete\nconstruction of instantons.\nIn the early 1980's Nahm [32, 33] sketched the Nahm transform, showing how it\nencompassed the ADHM construction, and describing the transform for monopoles and\n19\n\n\fSU (2) Monopole\n\u2712\n\n\u2745\n\u2745\n\u2745\n\u2758\n\u2745\n\nNahm data \u271b\n\nSpectral curve\n\nFigure 1.1: Hitchin's circle of ideas\ncalorons. It was apparent from this work, but not explicitly stated, that the transform\nwould work on T 4 and generalized tori. At roughly the same time Mukai [30] proved the\nexistence and invertibility of the transform between holomorphic bundles over complex\ntori which we mentioned on page 15. Later, Corrigan-Goddard [9] provided some of\nthe details missing from Nahm's original work on the transform for instantons and\nmonopoles.\nUp to this point there was no rigorous proof of the transform for monopoles including\nthe singularities in the Nahm data. Hitchin [17] proved the correspondence between\nSU (2) monopoles and Nahm data via spectral curves of monopoles. Using twistor\ntheory he proved a correspondence between SU (2) monopoles and certain algebraic\ncurves in the twistor space T P1 (C) of R3 [16]. Instead of constructing the Nahm\ndata directly from the cokernel of a Dirac operator coupled to a monopole, Hitchin [17]\nconsidered the spectral curve of the monopole and constructed a set of Nahm data from\nthis. By going round the circle shown in Figure 1.1 and proving the monopole obtained\nis isomorphic to the monopole started from, Hitchin showed that the construction\nof SU (2) monopoles from Nahm data is complete. Hurtubise-Murray [20] adopted a\nsimilar approach to prove completeness of the Nahm transform for SU (n) monopoles.\nIn 1989 Braam-van Baal [6] described the Nahm transform on T 4 as we presented\nit in Section 1.1.5, in terms of ASD connections and Dirac operators, rather than the\nholomorphic approach of Mukai [30]. At a similar time, Nakajima [34] proved the existence and invertibility of the Nahm transform for SU (2) monopoles by 'direct' means\n(i.e. via analysis of the relevant Dirac operators obtained by dimensional reduction of\nthe transform on T 4 ), rather than by the spectral curve method. A direct proof for\nSU (n) monopoles is yet to be given.\n\n1.1.8\n\nTwistor theory and spectral curves for monopoles\n\nIn this Section we expand on the twistor theory used to prove the existence of the Nahm\ntransform for monopoles. The twistor space for R3 is the set of oriented geodesics in R3 .\nThis can be identified with the tangent space to the 2-sphere, T S 2 \u223c\n= T P1 (C). Hitchin\n[16] proved a correspondence between certain rank 2 holomorphic bundles over twistor\n20\n\n\fspace T P1 (C), and SU (2) solutions (A, \u03a6) to the Bogomolny equation on a bundle\nE \u2192 R3 . Given a solution (A, \u03a6), the fibre \u1ebcz at z \u2208 T P1 (C) of the corresponding\nbundle is given by\n\n\u1ebcz = {s \u2208 \u0393(E|\u03b3z ) : (\u2207U \u2212 i\u03a6)s = 0}\nwhere \u03b3z is the oriented geodesic in R3 corresponding to z, and U is the unit vector\nalong \u03b3z . Imposing the SU (2) boundary conditions on the monopole, some analysis\nreveals that there is a holomorphic rank 1 sub-bundle L+ of \u1ebc, whose fibre at z is given\nby sections of E over \u03b3z solving\n(\u2207U \u2212 i\u03a6)s = 0\n\n(1.33)\n\nthat decay in the direction of the oriented geodesic \u03b3z . Similarly there is a holomorphic\nrank 1 sub-bundle L\u2212 whose fibre at z is given by solutions of (1.33) over \u03b3z that decay\nin the opposite direction. The spectral curve S \u2282 T P1 (C) is then defined by\n\u2212\nS = {z \u2208 T P1 (C) : L+\nz = Lz }\n\nso S consists of geodesics over which there exist solutions to (1.33) which decay at both\nends of the geodesic. The spectral curve is a compact algebraic curve, and from it one\ncan reconstruct \u1ebc and hence the original monopole. In other words, monopoles are\nuniquely determined by their spectral curves. Proofs for all these statements are given\nin [16]. As described in Section 1.1.7, the spectral curve is used to prove completeness\nof the construction of SU (2) monopoles from Nahm data in [17]. The Nahm data is\ngiven in terms of a flow on the Jacobian of the spectral curve.\nAs we mentioned above, twistor theory and spectral curves have also been used to\nprove completeness of the Nahm transform for SU (n) monopoles. In [20] HurtubiseMurray describe spectral curves and Nahm data for SU (n) monopoles, and give a\nchain of constructions equivalent to those in Figure 1.1. The spectral curve of an\nSU (n) monopole has (n \u2212 1) components in T P1 (C) with some prescribed intersection\n\nrelations. More relevant to us, however, is the Nahm picture for SU (n) monopoles.\n\nGiven an SU (n) monopole (A, \u03a6) we assume that at infinity \u03a6 has eigenvalues\ni\u03bc1 , . . . , i\u03bcn which define eigenbundles with Chern classes k1 , . . . , kn . (There are other\nboundary conditions which we ignore for the moment.) The \u03bcj are ordered so that\n\u03bcn \u2264 . . . \u2264 \u03bc1 . Hurtubise-Murray [20] show that the Nahm picture for (A, \u03a6) consists\n\nof (n \u2212 1) bundles Xp over the intervals [\u03bcp+1 , \u03bcp ], p = 1, . . . , n \u2212 1, such that\nrank Xp = k1 + * * * + kp .\n\n(1.34)\n\nEach bundle is equipped with a connection \u2207p and endomorphisms Tpj , j = 1, 2, 3,\n\nsatisfying Nahm's equation. At each \u03bcp there is a gluing condition between the bundles\n21\n\n\fTerminating\ncomponent:\nthis piece of the Nahm data\nhas a singularity exactly like\nthat for SU (2) data.\n\nRank\n\n\u273b\n\nRank= k1 + k2\n\n)\n\nRank= k1 + k2 + k3\n\n\u2720\n\n)\n\u03bc4\n\n\u03bc3\n\nContinuing component: this\npiece of the Nahm data is\ncontinuous across the join.\n\n\u2720\n\nRank= k1\n\n\u2732\n\n\u03bc2\n\n\u03bc1\n\n\u03be\n\nFigure 1.2: Typical U (4) monopole Nahm data illustrating gluing conditions at the\nsingularities\n\nRank\n\n\u273b\n\nZero jump: the Nahm data\nhas a prescribed discontinuity across the join.\nk2 = 0\n\n)\n\u03bc4\n\n\u03bc3\n\n\u03bc2\n\n\u2720\n\u2732\n\u03bc1\n\n\u03be\n\nFigure 1.3: Typical U (4) monopole Nahm data with a zero jump\n\n22\n\n\fXp and Xp\u22121 , which depends on the ranks of Xp and Xp\u22121 : see Figures 1.2 and 1.3.\nWhen kp = 0, rank Xp = rank Xp\u22121 and we call this a 'zero jump'.\nThis form for the Nahm data is precisely what you expect if you consider the cokernel\nof D\u03be , the Dirac operator defined by equation (1.28). Applying Callias' index theorem\nin a similar way as that on page 18, D\u03be is Fredholm except when \u03be \u2208 {\u03bc1 , . . . , \u03bcn }, and\n\nthe dimension of the cokernel is given by\n(\nk1 + * * * + kp\ndim coker D\u03be =\n0\n\nwhen \u03be \u2208 (\u03bcp+1 , \u03bcp ),\nwhen \u03be < \u03bcn or \u03be > \u03bc1 .\n\nThis agrees with equation (1.34).\n\n1.2\n\nReview of existing work on calorons\n\nRecent work on calorons consists of two main strands. First there is the work of\nGarland-Murray in which SU (n) calorons are regarded as monopoles whose structure\ngroup is the loop-group of SU (n). Secondly, Kraan and others have proved the existence\nof a version of the Nahm transform for a special kind of caloron, namely those with\nunit instanton charge and vanishing monopole charges. Before reviewing this work,\nhowever, we make some remarks on other places calorons appear in the literature.\nCalorons and their applications to QCD at finite temperature were first studied\nin the late 1970's: [10] contains a review of this work. In [15], Harrington-Shepard\nconstructed an explicit SU (2) caloron by arranging a periodic array of charge-1 instantons in R4 . Later, others showed how to take monopole and instanton limits of the\nHarrington-Shepard caloron (by letting the period tend to zero or infinity respectively).\nOther explicit solutions have been constructed by Chakrabarti using various ans\u00e4tze,\nincluding calorons with non-trivial monopole charges: see [8] and the references therein.\nCalorons and the Nahm transform have an interpretation in string and brane theory: a\ncaloron can be regarded as a periodic arrangement of strings and D-branes; the Nahm\ntransform is a correspondence between different brane configurations, called 'T-duality'.\nIn this thesis, however, we steer clear of these stringy issues.\n\n1.2.1\n\nThe loop group point of view\n\nGarland and Murray [13] make the remarkable observation that SU (n) periodic instantons are the same as monopoles with the group L\u0302SU (n) as their structure group,\nwhere L\u0302SU (n) is the semi-direct product of the loop group LSU (n) and U (1). In other\nwords, they show that the anti-self-duality equation (1.3) for a SU (n) connection on\nR4 is equivalent to the Bogomolny equation (1.5) for a L\u0302SU (n) monopole. Garland\nand Murray go on to develop twistor theory and the spectral curve picture for periodic\ninstantons, by regarding them as loop-valued monopoles, and extending known results\n23\n\n\ffor regular monopoles. In a similar vein, Norbury [35] has extended the rational map\nconstruction of SU (n) monopoles [11] to a construction of L\u0302SU (n) monopoles based\non holomorphic maps from S 2 to a certain flag manifold.\nIn general we will not make much use of the loop group approach in this thesis;\non the other hand it often gives clues as to what one might expect for calorons, by\nextending existing results for monopoles. In this Section we prove the correspondence\nbetween calorons and loop-group monopoles, before sketching Garland and Murray's\nwork [13] on the spectral curve of a caloron. Finally we describe the form we expect\ncaloron Nahm data to take, as sketched by Garland and Murray [13, Section 8]. First,\nhowever, we make the following definitions.\nLet G be a Lie group and g its Lie algebra. The loop group LG of G is the group of\nsmooth maps from S 1 to G with pointwise composition. Let Lg denote the Lie algebra\nof LG, that is Lg = Map(S 1 , g). Define the Lie group L\u0302G to be the semi-direct product\nof LG and U (1): as a set\nL\u0302G = LG \u00d7 U (1)\nand the composition is\n(g1 (\u03b8), ei\u03b11 ) \u25e6 (g2 (\u03b8), ei\u03b12 ) = (g1 (\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b12 ) \u25e6 g2 (\u03b8), ei(\u03b11 +\u03b12 ) ).\n(Note that there is a choice as to how we let U (1) act on LG. We have taken the choice\nas above since, as we shall see, it gives an adjoint action corresponding to ordinary\ngauge transformation on S 1 \u00d7 R3 .) The Lie algebra L\u0302g is then\nL\u0302g = Lg \u2295 iR.\nThe adjoint action of L\u0302G on L\u0302g is given by\nAd(g(\u03b8),ei\u03b1 ) (\u03be(\u03b8), i\u03bb) = (g(\u0398)\u03be(\u0398)g \u22121 (\u0398) \u2212 \u03bb\n\n\u2202g\n(\u0398)g\u22121 (\u0398), i\u03bb)\n\u2202\u03b8\n\n(1.35)\n\n\u2202\u03be1\n\u2202\u03be2\n\u2212 \u03bb2\n, 0).\n\u2202\u03b8\n\u2202\u03b8\n\n(1.36)\n\nwhere \u0398 = \u03b8 + \u03b1, and the Lie bracket is\n[(\u03be1 (\u03b8), i\u03bb1 ), (\u03be2 (\u03b8), i\u03bb2 )] = ([\u03be1 (\u03b8), \u03be2 (\u03b8)] + \u03bb1\n\nNext we want to describe the correspondence between SU (n) calorons and L\u0302SU (n)\nmonopoles. We will consider calorons with period 2\u03c0/\u03bc0 for some \u03bc0 \u2208 R. These can\n\n1\n1\nbe thought of as connections on bundles over S2\u03c0/\u03bc\n\u00d7 R3 where S2\u03c0/\u03bc\n= R/( 2\u03c0\n\u03bc0 Z).\n0\n0\n\n1\nGiven a connection A on a bundle E \u2192 S2\u03c0/\u03bc\n\u00d7 R3 fix a global trivialisation of E, and\n0\n\ndefine A and \u03a6 by\n\n\u2207A = \u2207A + dx0 (\u2202x0 + \u03a6)\n\n(1.37)\n\nso that A is a loop of connections on a bundle E \u2192 R3 and \u03a6 a loop of endomorphisms\n1\non E, parameterized by x0 \u2208 S2\u03c0/\u03bc\n.

We want to show that this correspondence\n1\nis gauge invariant. Let g : S2\u03c0/\u03bc\n\u00d7 R3 \u2192 SU (n) be a gauge transformation on E and\n0\n\nlet g(\u03b8) be the corresponding map R3 \u2192 LSU (n).

Under the correspondence given above,\nA is ASD if and only if \u00c2, \u03a6\u0302 satisfy the Bogomolny equation.\nProof: Fixing a global trivialisation of E, A is represented by a matrix of 1-forms\n\u03a6 dx0 +\n\n3\nX\n\nAi dxi .\n\ni=1\n\nThe coordinate form of the anti-self-duality equation (1.2) then implies\n(FA )23 + (FA )01 = 0\n\u21d4 \u22022 A3 \u2212 \u22023 A2 + [A2 , A3 ] + \u22020 A1 \u2212 \u22021 \u03a6 + [\u03a6, A1 ] = 0\n\u2202A1\n\u21d4 \u22022 A3 \u2212 \u22023 A2 + [A2 , A3 ]+ = \u22021 \u03a6 + [A1 , \u03a6] \u2212 \u03bc0\n\u2202\u03b8\nand cyclic permutations in {1, 2, 3}. These equations can be written invariantly as\n\u2217FA = \u2207A \u03a6 \u2212 \u03bc0\n\n\u2202A\n.\n\u2202\u03b8\n\n(1.39)\n\nOn the other hand, the L\u0302SU (n) Bogomolny equation is\n\u2217F\u0302\u00c2 = \u2207\u00c2 \u03a6\u0302\n\n(1.40)\n\nwhere F\u0302\u00c2 is the curvature of \u00c2. However F\u0302\u00c2 = (FA (\u03b8), 0), while from the bracket (1.36)\nwe have\n\u2207\u00c2 \u03a6\u0302 = ((\u2207A \u03a6)(\u03b8) \u2212 (\u03bc0 \u2202\u03b8 A)(\u03b8), 0).\n25\n\n\fHence (1.39) and (1.40) are equivalent.\n\n\u2737\n\nWith the correspondence between SU (n) calorons and L\u0302SU (n) monopoles established, Garland and Murray go on to consider the twistor theory and spectral curves of\n1\ncalorons. The twistor space of S2\u03c0/\u03bc\n\u00d7 R3 can be obtained by lifting the translation\n0\n\nx0 7\u2192 x0 + 2\u03c0/\u03bc0 on R4 to an action on the twistor space P3 (C) \\ P1 (C) of R4 , and\n\nquotienting by this action. (The twistor space T P1 (C) of R3 can be obtained in a\nsimilar fashion.) The quotient is a bundle T \u25e6 over T P1 (C) with fibre C\u00d7 = C \\ {0},\n\nand it can be embedded in a fibre bundle T \u2192 T P1 (C) with fibre P1 (C). Just like the\n\nmonopole case, standard twistor theory methods show that a caloron (E, A) determines\n\na holomorphic bundle \u1ebc\u25e6 over twistor space T \u25e6 . Garland and Murray show that if the\ncaloron satisfies certain boundary conditions, then \u1ebc\u25e6 extends to the compactification\n\nto define a holomorphic bundle \u1ebc \u2192 T . The bundle \u1ebc can then be used to define n\n\nspectral curves in T P1 (C): a point z \u2208 T P1 (C) lies in a given curve depending on the\nexistence of certain sections of \u1ebc over the fibre of T \u2192 T P1 (C) above z. In particular,\n\nsections over a fibre P1 (C) of T are characterized by how they extend from C\u00d7 to zero\nand infinity. Garland and Murray then show how a caloron is determined by its spectral\ncurves, constructing a caloron from a set of spectral data.\nGiven the twistor picture for calorons, and arguing by analogy with the monopole\ncase, one can predict what the Nahm picture for calorons should look like - this is\nsketched in [13, Section 8]. First, however, we need to describe Garland and Murray's\nboundary conditions for calorons. They require that there is a gauge at infinity in which\na L\u0302SU (n) monopole (\u00c2, \u03a6\u0302) of the form (1.38) agrees with a static (\u03b8-independent)\nSU (n) monopole configuration. Thus a caloron can be characterized asymptotically\nby the eigenvalues i\u03bc1 , . . . , i\u03bcn of the Higgs field in this gauge, and the Chern classes\nk1 , . . . , kn (the 'monopole charges'). There is an additional topological characteristic,\ndenoted k0 and called the 'instanton charge', that is the obstruction up to deformation\non the interior of R3 to the entire configuration being \u03b8-independent. In terms of an\nSU (n) periodic instanton (E, A) the boundary condition requires that there is a gauge\nat infinity in which A0 = \u03a6 has eigenvalues i\u03bc1 , . . . , i\u03bcn etc.\nWe expect the Nahm data corresponding to such a caloron to consist of n bundles\nXp , p = 1, . . . , n, over the intervals\nIp := [\u03bcp+1 , \u03bcp ] \u2282 R/\u03bc0 Z, p = 1, . . . , n\u22121,\n\nand\n\nIn := [\u03bc1 \u2212\u03bc0 , \u03bcn ] \u2282 R/\u03bc0 Z. (1.41)\n\nEach bundle Xp is equipped with a connection and endomorphisms satisfying Nahm's\nequation. Furthermore, we anticipate the rank of the data to be given by\nrank Xp = k0 + k1 + * * * + kp .\n\n(1.42)\n\n(Garland-Murray do not give this formula, but it is implicit from their work.) At each\n26\n\n\fRank\nk0 + k1 \u273b\n\nk0\n\n\u2732\n\u2212(\u03bc0 + \u03bc1 )\n\n\u03bc1 \u2212 \u03bc0\n\n\u2212\u03bc1\n\n0\n\n\u03bc1\n\n\u03bc0 \u2212 \u03bc1\n\n\u03bc0 + \u03bc1\n\n\u03be\n\nFigure 1.4: Typical SU (2) caloron Nahm data\npoint \u03be = \u03bcp we expect the Nahm data to satisfy conditions entirely similar to those\nfor SU (n) monopoles (recall Figures 1.2 and 1.3). A typical set of SU (2) caloron Nahm\ndata is illustrated in Figure 1.4.\n\n1.2.2\n\nCalorons with vanishing monopole charges\n\nThe Nahm transform for calorons has been studied recently for SU (n) calorons with\nunit instanton charge and vanishing monopole charges in a series of papers [23, 24, 22]\nand [26]. In terms of the boundary conditions described in Section 1.2.1, these calorons\nhave k0 = 1 and kj = 0 for j = 1, . . . , n. In [23], [24], and [22], Kraan and others\nconstruct such calorons from infinite arrays of ordinary ADHM data, corresponding to\nan arrangement of instantons in R4 repeated periodically, possibly with some topological\n'twist'. (This is, of course, a similar approach to the Harrington-Shepard construction,\nbut more general.) The caloron is given by the cokernel of an infinite-dimensional matrix\noperator \u2206(x), similar to the operator (1.26) for the regular ADHM construction, but\nconstructed from this array of data. By regarding the algebraic equation \u2206\u2217 (x)v = 0\nas a equation for the Fourier coefficients of a function on S 1 , Kraan obtains the Nahm\npicture for calorons. This agrees exactly with the Nahm picture conjectured at the end\nof Section 1.2.1 and consists of bundles Xp , p = 1, . . . , n over the intervals (1.41), each\nequipped with a connection and skew-adjoint endomorphisms T1 , T2 , T3 . The bundles\nall have rank 1, and so Nahm's equation reduces to\n\u2207Tj = 0,\n\nj = 1, 2, 3,\n\nsince the Tj commute. Working in a parallel gauge on each bundle, the matrices\nT1 , T2 , T3 are constant. At each point \u03be = \u03bcp there is a 'zero jump' (i.e. rank Xp+1 =\nrank Xp ), and the matrices have some prescribed discontinuity there. Kraan and van\nBaal [24] show that each discontinuity determines (and is determined by) a vector\nyp \u2208 R3 . Note that each block of data Xp is exactly the same as the Nahm data for a\n27\n\n\fThe Nahm matrices have\na prescribed discontinuity\nacross each zero jump.\n\n\u273b\n\n)\n\u2212(\u03bc0 + \u03bc1 )\n\n\u03bc1 \u2212 \u03bc0\n\n\u2701\n\u2701\n\u2701\u261b\n\n\u2701\n\u2701\n\n\u271f\u271f\n\u271f\n\u2719\u271f\n\u271f\n\n\u2701\n\u2701\n\n)\n\nRank\n\nOn the interior of each interval the Nahm matrices\nare constant.\n\nrank= 1\n\n\u2732\n\u2212\u03bc1\n\n0\n\n\u03bc1\n\n\u03bc0 \u2212 \u03bc1\n\n\u03bc0 + \u03bc1\n\n\u03be\n\nFigure 1.5: Typical SU (2) caloron Nahm data with vanishing monopole charges and\nunit instanton charge\ncharge-1 SU (2) monopole, and so the caloron can be said to consist of n 'constituent\nmonopoles'. Kraan and van Baal show that the constituent monopoles are located\nat the points yp \u2208 R3 . This interpretation does not hold for higher charge calorons:\n\nfor example, consider a caloron with k0 = 2 and vanishing monopole charges. The\nNahm data for the caloron should be discontinuous, but not singular, at each \u03be = \u03bcp ,\nwhile the data for a charge-2 SU (2) monopole has singularities at its endpoints. The\n\ncaloron Nahm data therefore cannot be assembled from n sets of monopole Nahm data.\nFigure 1.5 illustrates Nahm data for Kraan's calorons.\nSince Nahm's equation can be solved completely in the case of unit instanton charge\nand vanishing monopole charges, the construction of calorons can be given very explicitly. Roughly speaking, the locations of the 'constituent monopoles' y1 , . . . , yn and\nthe values \u03bc1 , . . . , \u03bcn determine the Nahm data completely: expressions for the corresponding caloron are given in terms of these data in [24]. Kraan and van Baal go on to\nconsider the moduli space of calorons, and argue completeness of their construction by\ncounting parameters. They also take various limits for the SU (n) caloron, obtaining\nmonopole (\u03bc0 \u2192 \u221e) and instanton (\u03bc0 \u2192 0) limits on the moduli space. Shrinking one\ninterval of the Nahm data gives a caloron with a 'massless' constituent monopole-the\n\nHarrington-Shepard caloron can be obtained in this way. Independently of Kraan, Lee\n[26] has given a very similar construction of calorons from this kind of Nahm data.\n\n1.3\n\nOverview of results\n\nThe aim of this thesis is to prove the existence of a version of the Nahm transform\nfor calorons as a generalization of the transform on the 4-torus. As indicated in Section 1.1.6, many aspects of the Nahm transform on the 4-torus carry across directly to\nthe caloron case, but we encounter the following difficulties:\n1. Boundary conditions. We need to specify boundary conditions on the caloron\n28\n\n\fthat are sufficiently strong for the transform from the caloron to the Nahm data\nto be possible, but sufficiently weak to be recovered for a caloron constructed\nfrom some set of Nahm data. The 'dual' problem-specifying conditions for the\nNahm data at singularities-is much more straightforward as we take these to\nbe exactly the same as the conditions for SU (n) monopoles. The main difficulty\nin the construction of calorons from Nahm data is proving the caloron obtained\nsatisfies the boundary conditions; conversely, obtaining the singularity conditions\nfor the Nahm data constructed from a caloron is also a difficult problem.\n2. The index formula. Given a caloron A we need a formula for the L2 -index of\n+\nthe Dirac operator DA,\u03be\n= DA+ \u2212 i\u03be in order to calculate the rank of the Nahm\n\ndata obtained from the transform.\n\nOur approach to these problems and our main results can be summarized in the\nfollowing way:\nChapter 2: the topology of calorons.\nWe define boundary conditions for calorons and explore topological aspects such as\ndeformation of caloron configurations. The main innovation is that we work on closed\nmanifolds with boundary rather than open manifolds with asymptotic boundary con3\n\nditions, and thus consider calorons on S 1 \u00d7 B where R3 is the interior of the closed\n3\n\nball B . This allows the boundary conditions to be stated very succinctly, but the\ndrawback is that we have to do more work to recover them in the Nahm transform. A\n3\n\nU (n) bundle E \u2192 S 1 \u00d7 B is framed if it is equipped with a trivialisation f at infin-\n\nity. There is a topological obstruction, denoted c2 (E, f ), to extending this to a global\n\ntrivialisation of E. Our boundary condition for a caloron A on E is that it should\nresemble the pull-back of a U (n) monopole configuration in the trivialisation f . Thus\ncalorons are characterized by the eigenvalues i\u03bc1 , . . . , i\u03bcn of the Higgs field at infinity,\nthe Chern classes k1 , . . . , kn of the corresponding eigenbundles, the period 2\u03c0/\u03bc0 , and\nthe invariant k0 = c2 (E, f ) of the framed bundle. We go on to define a map between\ncalorons in different topological classes which corresponds to a rotation of the Nahm\ndata round S 1 . This 'rotation map' has been considered previously by Lee [26, 25] for\ncalorons with vanishing monopole charges, but its relation with the Nahm transform\nhas not been fully explored. It plays an important r\u00f4le in our construction of calorons\nfrom Nahm data.\nChapter 3: the transform from Nahm data to calorons.\nNahm data for calorons was described at the end of Section 1.2.1. Let N \u2217 (k0 , ~k, \u03bc0 , ~\n\u03bc)\n\ndenote the collection (modulo gauge transformations) of Nahm data characterized by\n(k0 , ~k, \u03bc0 , \u03bc\n~ ), so that the data is singular at \u03be = \u03bc1 , . . . , \u03bcn and has rank given by (1.42).\n29\n\n\fHere ~k = (k1 , . . . , kn ) and similarly for ~\u03bc, and we call (k0 , ~k, \u03bc0 , ~\u03bc) a set of caloron\nboundary data. Let C \u2217 (k0 , ~k, \u03bc0 , ~\u03bc) be the collection of calorons (modulo gauge transformations) with boundary conditions defined by (k0 , ~k, \u03bc0 , ~\u03bc). We prove the following\n\nin Chapter 3:\nTheorem (Nahm data \u2192 caloron). For each set of boundary data (k0 , ~k, \u03bc0 , ~\u03bc), the\nNahm transform is a well-defined map from N \u2217 (k0 , ~k, \u03bc0 , \u03bc\n~ ) to C \u2217 (k0 , ~k, \u03bc0 , \u03bc\n~ ).\nShowing that the connection constructed from the Nahm data is ASD, periodic,\nand SU (n), is relatively easy, and the main difficulty lies in recovering the boundary\nconditions. In the notation of Section 1.1.5, Dx+ is the Dirac operator whose cokernel\ngives the caloron. We define a model operator D\u0303x+ -a deformation of Dx+ -and prove\nthat the cokernel of D\u0303x+ gives a periodic connection satisfying the desired boundary\nconditions, but not the ASD condition. We then prove that the boundary conditions\nare not affected by the deformation, and conclude that the cokernel of Dx+ therefore\nsatisfies the desired boundary conditions. This approach was used by Hitchin [17] to\nrecover the boundary conditions for an SU (2) monopole. We have extended it in three\nways: firstly to deal with zero jumps (which cannot occur for an SU (2) monopole);\n3\n\nsecondly to work right up to the boundary of B ; and finally to model Dx+ on the\ninterior as well as at infinity. This last point is necessary to recover k0 , which is the\nobstruction to extending the framing of the caloron to the interior, and so requires\n3\n\nunderstanding of Dx+ (at least up to deformation) when x is in the interior of S 1 \u00d7 B .\n\nDefining the model operator D\u0303x+ requires some ingenuity, and recovering the boundary\nconditions occupies the majority of Chapter 3.\nChapter 4: the transform from calorons to Nahm data.\nWe aim to prove:\nTheorem (Caloron \u2192 Nahm data). For each set of boundary data (k0 , ~k, \u03bc0 , \u03bc\n~ ),\n\u2217\n\u2217\nthe Nahm transform is a well-defined map from C (k0 , ~k, \u03bc0 , \u03bc\n~ ) to N (k0 , ~k, \u03bc0 , \u03bc\n~ ).\nIn particular, we have to prove that the rank of the Nahm data obtained is given\nby (1.42), and that the Nahm data obtained satisfies the desired singularity conditions.\nThe rank condition follows from the following theorem:\nTheorem (The index theorem). Given a caloron A on a framed bundle (E, f ) which\nsatisfies the boundary conditions specified by (k0 , ~k, \u03bc0 , \u03bc\n~ ), D + = D + \u2212 i\u03be is Fredholm\nA,\u03be\n\nwith\n\nL2 -index\n\n+\nind DA,\u03be\n= \u2212(k0 + k1 + . . . + kp )\n\nwhen \u03be \u2208 interior Ip and Ip is defined by (1.41) for p = 1, . . . , n.\n30\n\nA\n\n\fThe proof of the index theorem involves two main steps. The first is a calculation of\nthe index when k0 = c2 (E, f ) = 0, in which case the caloron can be deformed through\nthe space of calorons satisfying the boundary conditions, until it is independent of x0 .\nCallias' index theorem [7] is used to compute the index in this case. The second step\nuses an excision theorem of Gromov-Lawson [14] to reduce the problem to the case\nk0 = 0. The theorem has been published, together with some material from Chapter 2,\nin [36], and a copy of this paper is attached to the thesis.\nThe singularity conditions are recovered, in part at least, by generalizing Nakajima's\nanalysis [34] of the singularities for SU (2) monopoles. We successfully recover the\nsingularity conditions at points \u03be = \u03bcp where kp 6= 0 under the assumption of two\n\nanalytic conjectures given in Section 4.4.4. Note that we do not give a complete proof\n\nof the Theorem (Caloron \u2192 Nahm data): we do not recover the gluing conditions at\n\nzero jumps in the Nahm data, and we do not show that the Nahm data obtained gives\n\nrise to an injective operator Dx+ -a necessary condition for the Nahm data to lie inside\nN \u2217 (k0 , ~k, \u03bc0 , ~\n\u03bc).\n\n1.4\n\nOpen problems\n\nBehaviour at the singular points. There are a few problems concerning the behaviour of the Nahm data constructed from a monopole or caloron which we do not\nresolve. These are explained in Section 4.4.4.\nInjectivity of the Nahm operator and invertibility of the transform. An obvious 'next step' following this thesis is to prove that the transform from Nahm data to\ncalorons and the transform from calorons to Nahm data described in Chapters 3 and\n4 are mutually inverse. One approach to proving invertibility is to adapt Donaldson\n \u0304\nand Kronheimer's method [12, Chapter 3] that uses holomorphic geometry and \u2202cohomology. Another approach, more in keeping with the rest of this thesis, is to adapt\nNakajima's analytic proof that the Nahm transform for SU (2) monopoles is invertible\n[34, Sections 4 and 5]. We remarked above that our proof of the Theorem (Caloron \u2192\n\nNahm data) is incomplete because we do not prove injectivity of the 'Nahm operator'\nDx+ = \u2206(x) constructed from the Nahm data in a similar way to (1.32). Without this\nestablished, it may not be possible to apply the inverse transform to go back to the\ncaloron. This is not a serious problem: if we perform the transform on a caloron, and\nthen form the Nahm operator \u2206 from the Nahm data obtained, it is easy to prove\nthat \u2206(x) is injective away from a finite collection of points, so the inverse transform is\ndefined almost everywhere. A first step towards proving invertibility is to express the\nGreens function of \u2206\u2217 (x)\u2206(x) in terms of smooth solutions \u03c8 of D\u03be\u2212 \u03c8 = (DA\u2212 +i\u03be)\u03c8 = 0\n(see [6, Section 2.3] for the 4-torus calculation). This Greens function should have some\n31\n\n\fcanonical form in terms of the spinors \u03c8. A proof by contradiction shows that \u2206(x)\nis injective: if it is not then the spinors \u03c8 cannot be smooth. Braam-van Baal [6,\nProposition 2.5] and Corrigan-Goddard [9, Section 3] use an argument like this for the\n4-torus and ADHM construction respectively. With this in place, adapting Nakajima's\nproof of invertibility should be quite straight-forward.\nThe moduli space of calorons. There are many open problems concerning the\nmoduli space of calorons, including fundamental problems such as proving existence\nand smoothness, calculating the dimension of the space, and proving the existence of a\nhyperK\u00e4hler metric. These fundamental problems also apply to the space of Nahm data.\nWith these problems solved, it might be possible to prove that the Nahm transform is a\nhyperK\u00e4hler isometry between the two spaces. One could then explore the moduli space\nof calorons by working on the space of Nahm data. Many of the problems investigated\nfor monopoles, for example calculation of the metric for widely separated constituents\nor scattering for symmetric configurations, could be carried over to calorons.\nMonopole and instanton limits of calorons. One of the reasons for studying\ncalorons is that they form an interpolating case between monopoles and instantons.\nAn obvious question to ask is whether we can find families of calorons with a monopole\nor instanton limit. In terms of moduli spaces it might be possible to prove that monopoles and instantons form the boundary of the caloron moduli space in some sense.\nKraan and van Baal [22, 24] have constructed such families for calorons with vanishing\nmonopole charges and unit instanton charge. However, these involve taking the limit\nas one interval of the Nahm data is contracted to zero (taking the 'massless monopole\nlimit' in physics language). This is the same as looking at monopoles and calorons with\nnon-maximal symmetry breaking-opening up a wide range of problems. Throughout\nthis thesis we will only consider calorons with maximal symmetry breaking.\n\n32\n\n\fChapter 2\n\nThe Topology of Calorons\nThis Chapter is concerned with topological aspects of calorons, especially boundary\nconditions. Based on the boundary conditions used by Garland-Murray [13, Section\n3], in Section 2.1 we define a set of boundary conditions which are sufficiently strong\nfor the Nahm transform from calorons to Nahm data to be possible, but which can\nbe recovered for a caloron constructed from some set of Nahm data. We draw the\nreader's attention to definitions 2.6, 2.9, and 2.10-these are central to the rest of\nthe thesis. In Section 2.2 we study 'large' gauge transformations (non-periodic gauge\ntransformations that leave the caloron periodic) and a map between different calorons\ngiven by such a gauge transformation, that in some sense corresponds to rotation of\nthe Nahm data round S 1 . Section 2.3 contains a slight digression in which the caloron\nboundary conditions are derived by regarding a SU (n) caloron as a L\u0302SU (n) monopole\nand imposing the monopole boundary conditions.\n\n2.1\n\nBoundary conditions\n\nBoundary conditions for objects on open manifolds can be regarded from two points of\nview:\n1. one can specify a set of asymptotic conditions that control behaviour as 'infinity'\nis approached;\n2. alternatively, one can glue on a boundary to obtain a compact manifold with\nboundary, and demand that objects extend to the boundary and have fixed behaviour there.\nThe second approach is motivated by the work of Melrose (see [27, 28]). It allows\nthe boundary conditions to be stated more concisely, and is the approach we adopt\nto define the boundary conditions in Sections 2.1.1 and 2.1.3. I acknowledge the help\nof my supervisor, Michael Singer, with the definitions in this Section, many of which\nappeared in our joint publication [36].\n33\n\n\f3\n\nWe compactify R3 by identifying it with the interior of the closed 3-ball B . As\n1\npreviously, we consider calorons with period 2\u03c0/\u03bc0 , and let S2\u03c0/\u03bc\n= R/( 2\u03c0\n\u03bc0 Z). Let\n0\n3\n\n3\n\n1\n1\n2 , and let p : X \u2192 B be\nX = S2\u03c0/\u03bc\n\u00d7 B , denote the boundary by \u2202X = S2\u03c0/\u03bc\n\u00d7 S\u221e\n0\n0\n3\n\n1\n\u00d7 R3 .\nthe projection on to B . The interior X o = X \\ \u2202X can be identified with S2\u03c0/\u03bc\n0\n\nLet x0 , . . . , x3 be the coordinates on X o corresponding to the standard coordinates on\n\nR4 under projection R4 \u2192 X o , and orient X o so that dx0 , dx1 , dx2 , dx3 is positive. Let\n\n1\nthe metric g on S2\u03c0/\u03bc\n\u00d7 R3 be the standard flat product metric that gives the circle\n0\n\nlength 2\u03c0/\u03bc0 . Next we write down coordinates near the boundary of X and derive the\n\nform of the metric g in these coordinates. Let r, y1 , y2 be polar coordinates on R3 , so\nthat r is the distance from the origin in R3 and y1 , y2 are some local angular coordinates\n2 . We suppose y and y are chosen so that g takes the form\non S\u221e\n1\n2\n\ng = dr 2 + r 2 (h1 dy12 + h2 dy22 ) + dx20 ,\nfor some positive locally-defined functions h1 , h2 . Local coordinates near the boundary\nof X will be \u03c7 = r \u22121 , y1 , y2 and x0 , so that \u03c7 becomes a boundary defining function:\n\u03c7 \u2265 0 on X, with equality only at \u2202X, and d\u03c7 6= 0 on \u2202X. Writing g in terms of \u03c7,\ng=\n\ndy12\ndy22\nd\u03c72\n2\n+\nh\n+\nh\n1 2\n2 2 + dx0 ,\n\u03c74\n\u03c7\n\u03c7\n\n(2.1)\n\nso g is singular at the boundary.\n\n2.1.1\n\nBoundary conditions for monopoles\n3\n\nLet E \u2192 B be the trivial U (n) vector bundle and let E\u221e = E|S\u221e\n2 . Suppose A\u221e is\n\na U (n) connection on E\u221e , \u03a6\u221e is a skew-adjoint endomorphism on E\u221e , and that the\nfollowing conditions are satisfied:\n\u03a6\u221e has n distinct constant eigenvalues, and\n\nA\u221e =\n\nn\nM\nj=1\n\nPj * d\n\n(2.2)\n\n(2.3)\n\nwhere Pj is projection onto the j-th eigenbundle, and d is the covariant derivative on\nE\u221e . It follows that \u2207A\u221e \u03a6\u221e = 0. The condition that the eigenvalues are distinct is\n\nthat of maximal symmetry breaking: although this is not required for many of our\nresults, we only prove the existence of the Nahm transform for calorons with maximal\nsymmetry breaking. We therefore assume maximal symmetry breaking from the outset.\nNote that we also assume n \u2265 2 (since we are ultimately interested in the gauge group\n\nSU (n)).\n\nDefinition 2.4. A U (n) monopole configuration framed by (A\u221e , \u03a6\u221e ) is a unitary connection A on E and a skew-adjoint endomorphism \u03a6 on E that satisfy\nA|S\u221e\n2 = A\u221e and \u03a6|S 2 = \u03a6\u221e .\n\u221e\n34\n\n\fWe will also work with SU (n) monopole configurations, in which case we require \u03a6\nand \u03a6\u221e to be trace-free and A to be compatible with the volume form. Note that a\nmonopole configuration is not required to satisfy the Bogomolny equation. The gauge\ntransformations are the unitary bundle automorphisms of E that are the identity at\ninfinity.\nLet i\u03bc1 , . . . , i\u03bcn be the eigenvalues of \u03a6\u221e , and order them so that \u03bcn < \u03bcn\u22121 <\n* * * < \u03bc1 . Let kj be the Chern class of the eigenbundle with eigenvalue i\u03bcj . Thus we\nhave ~k = (k1 , . . . , kn ) \u2208 Zn and \u03bc\n~ = (\u03bc1 , . . . , \u03bcn ) \u2208 Rn satisfying:\n1.\n\nPn\n1\n\nkj = 0,\n\n2. \u03bcn < \u03bcn\u22121 < * * * < \u03bc1 .\nThis choice of notation matches that in [13] and [20].\nDefinition 2.5. A pair (~k, \u03bc\n~ ) is a set of U (n) monopole boundary data if it satisfies\nthese two conditions. It is a set of SU (n) monopole boundary data if in addition it\nP\nsatisfies n1 \u03bcj = 0.\nWe have shown that on one hand a pair A\u221e , \u03a6\u221e satisfying the boundary conditions\n\ndetermines a set of boundary data; on the other hand note that a set of monopole\nboundary data (~k, ~\n\u03bc) determines A\u221e , \u03a6\u221e uniquely up to isomorphism.\n\n2.1.2\n\nFramed bundles\n\nDefinition 2.6. A U (n) framed bundle over X consists of a pair (E, f ) where E \u2192 X\nis a U (n) vector bundle and f : E|\u2202X \u2192 p\u2217 E\u221e is a unitary bundle-isomorphism.\n\nThere exists a topological obstruction to extending f to a global identification of E\nwith p\u2217 E, and we use this to define an invariant c2 (E, f ) of a framed bundle. Consider\nwhat happens when we try to extend f : for each s we can find an identification F(s) :\n2 . We can do this continuously, and\nE|x0 =s \u2192 E that agrees with f(s) = f |x0 =s on S\u221e\n\nobtain a path of maps F(s) for s in some interval I\u01eb = (\u2212\u01eb, 2\u03c0/\u03bc0 + \u01eb). Define\n\u22121\n\u2208 Aut0 E\nc(s) = F(s+2\u03c0/\u03bc0 ) F(s)\n\n(2.7)\n\n2 .\nwhere Aut0 E is the group of unitary automorphisms of E that are the identity on S\u221e\n\nThen c represents an element of\n\u03c00 Aut0 E = \u03c00 Map(S 3 , U (n)) = \u03c03 U (n) = Z\nwhich we call deg c. Note that deg c is independent of the choice of F , that the choice\nof F corresponds to a bundle automorphism of E, and that F can be chosen so that c is\n\n35\n\n\findependent of s. If c is sufficiently smooth then there is the following integral formula\nfor deg c:\n\n1\ndeg c =\n24\u03c0 2\n\nZ\n\nB\n\n3\n\ntr (dcc\u22121 )3 .\n\n(2.8)\n\nTo establish this formula it is easier to work with a map c : S 3 \u2192 U (n) and prove that\n\ndeg c is given by the same integral over S 3 . It is easy to check that the formula holds\nwhen c is the standard map with deg c = 1:\nc(x) =\n\n3\nX\n\n\u03b3a xa\n\n0\n\nwhere kxk = 1.\n\nTo prove that the integral depends only on the homotopy class of c, consider a family\nof maps ct defined for all t in some open interval in R. The form\n3\ntr \u2202t (dct c\u22121\nt )\n\nis exact, so\n\u2202t\n\nZ\n\nS3\n\n3\ntr (dct c\u22121\nt ) =0\n\nand it follows that the integral is homotopy invariant. Finally, given some c : S 3 \u2192 U (n)\n\nand some k \u2208 Z, a short calculation shows that\n\ntr [d(ck )c\u2212k ] = ktr (dcc\u22121 ) + exact terms.\nThis proves the integral formula for deg c for c \u2208 Map(S 3 , U (n)). Identifying Aut0 E\nwith Map(S 3 , U (n)) then gives (2.8).\n\nDefinition 2.9. Given a framed bundle (E, f ) let c2 (E, f ) = deg c. We may also write\nc2 (E, f )[X].\nWe can equally well work with gauge group SU (n), in which case the clutching map\nc takes values in SAut0 E, the group of special unitary automorphisms of E that are\nthe identity on the boundary. The same formula holds for deg c.\n\n2.1.3\n\nBoundary conditions for calorons\n\nLet A\u221e , \u03a6\u221e be a U (n) connection and endomorphism on E\u221e satisfying (2.2) and (2.3).\nDefinition 2.10. Let A be a unitary connection on a framed bundle (E, f ). Then A\nis a U (n) caloron configuration framed by A\u221e , \u03a6\u221e if\nA|\u2202X = p\u2217 A\u221e + p\u2217 \u03a6\u221e dx0\nwhere the framing f is being used to identify E|\u2202X with p\u2217 E\u221e .\n\n36\n\n\fWe can define SU (n) caloron configurations in a similar way by equipping E with\na parallel volume form. Note that the gauge transformations are (strictly periodic)\nunitary bundle automorphisms of E. A gauge transformation g acts on the framing f\nby f 7\u2192 f g\u22121 , and acts on the connection in the usual way.\n\nJust as for monopoles, the boundary conditions for a caloron configuration determine (and are determined by) a set of boundary data (k0 , ~k, \u03bc0 , \u03bc\n~ ). In particular the\nHiggs field at infinity, \u03a6\u221e , determines a set of monopole boundary data (~k, \u03bc\n~ ) and we\nassume that \u03bcn < . . . < \u03bc1 . In addition the caloron configuration is characterized by\n\u03bc0 and by\nk0 = c2 (E, f ).\nWe require two further conditions:\n\nand\n\np\nX\nj=0\n\n\u03bc0 \u2212 (\u03bc1 \u2212 \u03bcn ) > 0.\n\n(2.11)\n\nkj \u2265 0 for p = 0, 1, . . . , n\n\n(2.12)\n\nThe first condition is equivalent to saying that, regarding the caloron as a loop-group\nmonopole as in Section 1.2.1, the Higgs field at infinity lies in the positive Weyl chamber\nof the Lie algebra. Garland and Murray [13] discuss this condition in greater detail.\nThe second condition ensures that each block of Nahm data has positive rank. It can\nbe derived from the spectral curve picture-see [13, Section 4].\nDefinition 2.13. A set of caloron boundary data is a set (k0 , ~k, \u03bc0 , \u03bc\n~ ) where (~k, ~\u03bc) is a\nset of monopole boundary data, and the two conditions (2.11) and (2.12) are satisfied.\nThe boundary data is said to be principal if\np\nX\n1\n\nkj \u2265 0 for p = 1, . . . , n.\n\nThe condition of being principal is important in the context of the rotation map\nwhich we discuss in Section 2.2, and is equivalent to saying that the lowest rank of any\nblock of the Nahm data is k0 .\nFor each set of caloron boundary data we need the following quantities. Let\nmp =\n\np\nX\n\nkj\n\n(2.14)\n\n0\n\nfor p = 1, . . . , n and\n\u03bbp = \u03bcp \u2212 \u03bcp+1\n\n(2.15)\n\nfor p = 1, . . . , n\u22121 and take \u03bbn = (\u03bc0 +\u03bcn )\u2212\u03bc1 . In the physics literature mp and \u03bbp are\ncalled the charges and masses of the 'constituent monopoles' of the caloron respectively.\nNote that (k0 , ~k, \u03bc0 , ~\n\u03bc) is principal iff mn = min{m1 , . . . , mn }.\n37\n\n\f2.1.4\n\nFramed quasi-periodic connections\n\nLet I\u01eb = (\u2212\u01eb, 2\u03c0/\u03bc0 + \u01eb) be some open neighbourhood of the interval [0, 2\u03c0/\u03bc0 ] with\n3\n\n3\n\ncoordinate s. Let q be the projection q : I\u01eb \u00d7 B \u2192 B and let Eq = q \u2217 E. There is\n\nan obvious correspondence between caloron configurations and connections on Eq -we\nspell out the details in this Section. Let A\u221e , \u03a6\u221e satisfy (2.2) and (2.3).\nDefinition 2.16. A U (n) connection Aq on Eq is quasi-periodic with clutching map c\nif\nAq (2\u03c0/\u03bc0 + s) = (c\u22121 )\u2217 Aq (s)\nfor some map\nc : (\u2212\u01eb, \u01eb) \u2192 Aut0 E\n\nc(s) : Eq |s \u2192 Eq |s+2\u03c0/\u03bc0 .\nWe say that Aq clutches with clutching function c. The map c has a degree since it\nrepresents an element of \u03c00 (Aut0 E).\nSU (n) quasi-periodic connections are defined in exactly the same way, except the\nclutching function c takes values in SAut0 E.\nDefinition 2.17. A connection Aq on Eq is framed by A\u221e , \u03a6\u221e if\n\u2217\n\u2217\nAq |S\u221e\n2 = q A\u221e + q \u03a6\u221e ds.\n\nThere is a 1 \u2212 1 correspondence between caloron configurations and quasi-periodic\n\nconnections framed by A\u221e , \u03a6\u221e (up to bundle isomorphism). Given a caloron configuration A on (E, f ), extend f by F (as in Section 2.1.2). Let Aq = (F \u22121 )\u2217 A. Then Aq is\na framed quasi-periodic connection with clutching function given by (2.7). Conversely,\ngiven a framed quasi-periodic connection Aq with clutching function c, quotienting by\n\nthe action of c gives a framed caloron configuration A on a framed bundle (E, f ) with\n2 . The\nc2 (E, f ) = deg c. The framing f is properly periodic on E because c = 1 on S\u221e\n\ncorrespondence is determined up to bundle automorphisms on Eq that are the iden2 , and periodic bundle automorphisms of E. Given a caloron\ntity on the boundary S\u221e\n\nconfiguration A, we call the corresponding framed quasi-periodic connection Aq the\nquasi-periodic pull-back of A.\n\n2.1.5\n\nCalorons as loops of monopoles\n\nThere is a correspondence between loops of monopoles 'with a twist' and caloron configurations. Fix a set of monopole boundary data (~k, ~\u03bc) and let A\u221e , \u03a6\u221e be the connection\n\n38\n\n\f2 this determines. Let Mon(~\nand Higgs field on S\u221e\nk, \u03bc\n~ ) denote the set of all U (n)-\n\nmonopole configurations which are framed by A\u221e , \u03a6\u221e (as defined by Definition 2.4).\nMon(~k, \u03bc\n~ ) is equipped with gauge group Aut0 E, and c \u2208 Aut0 E acts according to\nc(A) = cAc\u22121 \u2212 dcc\u22121 ,\n\nc(\u03a6) = c\u03a6c\u22121 .\n\nNow \u03c00 (Aut0 E) = \u03c03 (U (n)) = Z. Moreover, Mon(~k, \u03bc\n~ ) is an affine space, hence\ncontractible, so \u03c01 (Mon(~k, ~\n\u03bc)/Aut0 E) = \u03c00 (Aut0 E) = Z. Let L(k0 , ~k, \u03bc0 , \u03bc\n~ ) denote\nthe smooth (free) loops in Mon(~k, ~\u03bc)/Aut0 E with degree k0 and parameterized by\n\ns \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0/\u03bc0 ]. Some care is needed to ensure loops are smooth across the ends of\n\npaths, so we note the following characterization of smooth loops. Suppose A(s), \u03a6(s)\nis some path in Mon(~k, ~\n\u03bc) such that\nA(2\u03c0/\u03bc0 ) = c(A(0)), \u03a6(2\u03c0/\u03bc0 ) = c(\u03a6(0))\nfor some c \u2208 Aut0 E. The path defines a smooth loop in Mon(~k, ~\u03bc)/Aut0 E if and\n\nonly if it can be extended to a path defined for s \u2208 (\u2212\u01eb, 2\u03c0/\u03bc0 + \u01eb), for some small \u01eb,\n\nsuch that\n\nA(2\u03c0/\u03bc0 + s) = c(A(s)), \u03a6(2\u03c0/\u03bc0 + s) = c(\u03a6(s))\n\n(2.18)\n\nfor s \u2208 (\u2212\u01eb, \u01eb). Note that c is independent of s.\n\nThere is a correspondence up to isomorphism between caloron configurations with\nboundary data (k0 , ~k, \u03bc0 , \u03bc\n~ ) and elements of L(k0 , ~k, \u03bc0 , \u03bc\n~ ), which follows immediately\nusing the quasi-periodic pull-back of a caloron configuration. A loop in Mon(~k, ~\n\u03bc)\n\nwhose ends are related by (2.18) determines a framed quasi-periodic connection via\nAq = A + \u03a6ds\n\n(2.19)\n\nand hence a caloron configuration with boundary data (k0 , ~k, \u03bc0 , \u03bc\n~ ). On the other\nhand, given a framed caloron configuration consider its framed quasi-periodic pull-back\nAq with clutching map c. As we have already seen, Aq can be chosen so that c is\nindependent of s. The splitting (2.19) then determines an element of L(k0 , ~k, \u03bc0 , ~\u03bc).\n\nNote that the correspondence does not restrict to a correspondence between loops of\n\nmonopoles satisfying the Bogomolny equation and anti-self-dual calorons (compare the\nBogomolny equation (1.5) with the equation for loop-group monopoles (1.39)). Also\nnote the difference between the picture of a caloron as a twisted loop of framed monopole\n3\n\nconfigurations (where the twisting occurs on the interior of B ) and the loop-group\npicture (where the twisting is at infinity).\nIn the light of this correspondence, it is clear that a monopole configuration can be\n3\n\n3\n\n1\n\u00d7 B to give a caloron configuration with k0 = 0. We\npulled-back from B to S2\u03c0/\u03bc\n0\n\nwill need the following converse:\n\n39\n\n\fLemma 2.20. Let A be a framed U (n) caloron on a framed bundle with c2 (E, f )[X] = 0.\nThen there is a deformation B of A (through framed U (n) caloron configurations), such\nthat B is the pull-back of a monopole.\nProof: Let Aq be a quasi-periodic pull-back of A. Then Aq has clutching map c with\ndeg c = 0. Let cext be any smooth unitary automorphism of Eq satisfying\n\uf8f1\n3\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2c on ( \u03bc0 \u2212 \u01eb, \u03bc0 + \u01eb) \u00d7 B ,\n2 ,\ncext = 1 on I\u01eb \u00d7 S\u221e\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n3\n1 on (\u2212\u01eb, \u01eb) \u00d7 B .\n\nSuch an extension exists if and only if deg c = 0. Acting on Aq by cext , we reduce to\nthe case c \u2261 1. If we define a connection and endomorphism (A, \u03a6) on E by\nA + \u03a6 ds = Aq (s = 0)\nthen\nBq (s) = A + \u03a6ds\nis a framed quasi-periodic connection which is the pull-back of the monopole configuration (A, \u03a6). Moreover, Aq can be deformed to Bq through framed quasi-periodic\nconnections with c \u2261 1 via the obvious linear path.\n\n2.1.6\n\n\u2737\n\nSmoothness at the boundary\n\nUp to this point we have been deliberately vague about the precise degree of smoothness\nup to the boundary that we are assuming (i.e. whether connections are continuous or\nsmooth up to the boundary)-Definitions 2.4, 2.6, 2.9, 2.10, and 2.17 all make sense\nif we assume only continuity up to the boundary. In this Section we specify precise\nsmoothness conditions for our objects. We also give a brief comparison of our boundary\nconditions with the asymptotic boundary conditions for calorons used by Garland and\nMurray [13] and others.\nWe will need the following spaces of functions:\nDefinition 2.21. C\u03c7k (X) is the space of functions f on X such that f is smooth on\nX o , and for all \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 and all l \u2264 k, \u2202\u03c7l \u2202y\u03b11 \u2202y\u03b22 \u2202x\u03b30 f is continuous up to the boundary.\nDefinition 2.22. A 1-form \u03b1 on X is C\u03c70,1 if the d\u03c7 component is C\u03c70 and the other\ncomponents are C\u03c71 .\nLet A be a caloron configuration on a framed bundle (E, f ) that is continuous up\nto the boundary, and framed by A\u221e , \u03a6\u221e . Then there exist local gauges on E defined\nfor sufficiently small \u03c7 \u2265 0 and all x0 , in which\nAx0 = diag(i\u03bc1 , . . . , i\u03bcn ),\n40\n\n(2.23)\n\n\fand\nAyj = diag(h\u2202yj e1 , e1 i, . . . , h\u2202yj en , en i),\n\nj = 1, 2,\n\n(2.24)\n\n2 , where e , . . . , e is a local trivialisation of E\non S\u221e\n1\nn\n\u221e respecting the decomposition\n\ninto eigenbundles, and such that Ax0 , Ay1 , Ay2 , A\u03c7 are continuous up to the boundary.\nHere Ax0 , Ayj , A\u03c7 are the matrices representing A in the fixed gauge. Conversely, if\nsuch gauges exist for some connection A on E, then A is framed by A\u221e , \u03a6\u221e and some\nmap f : E|\u2202X \u2192 p\u2217 E\u221e . We restrict attention to caloron configurations for which there\nexist local gauges satisfying (2.23) and (2.24) in which A is C\u03c70,1 . We call these C\u03c70,1\ncaloron configurations.\nIn addition, we also require that, on the boundary, A\u03c7 is diagonal and independent\nof x0 in these gauges. We impose this condition to ensure that Ax0 has the following\nasymptotic behaviour:\nAx0 = diag(i\u03bc1 , . . . , i\u03bcn ) \u2212\n\n\u03c7\ndiag(ik1 , . . . , ikn ) + higher order terms\n2\n\n(2.25)\n\nwhen A is anti-self-dual. To obtain this, extend the framing f to a neighbourhood of the\nboundary, perform the \"3 + 1\" decomposition (1.37), and consider the d\u03c7 component\nof the anti-self-duality equation (1.39):\n\u22173 FA = \u2207A \u03a6 \u2212 \u2202x0 A.\n\n(2.26)\n\nWorking in the gauges described above, on the boundary \u2202X the d\u03c7 component of the\nLHS of (2.26) is \u2212 21 diag(ik1 , . . . , ikn ), because A\u221e is the standard connection on each\n\nconstituent line bundle of E\u221e . On the RHS of (2.26) the second term vanishes on the\nboundary, while the d\u03c7 component of the first is \u2202\u03c7 Ax0 . Equating the two sides of (2.26)\nshows that the O(\u03c7) term of Ax0 is \u2212 12 diag(ik1 , . . . , ikn ), and so we obtain (2.25). We\nwill need the expansion (2.25) in Chapter 4 when we construct Nahm data from a given\ncaloron.\nDefinition 2.27. Given a set of U (n) caloron boundary data, let C(k0 , ~k, \u03bc0 , \u03bc\n~ ) be\nthe set of gauge equivalence classes of U (n) C\u03c70,1 caloron configurations (E, A) sat-\n\nisfying these smoothness conditions, whose boundary conditions are determined by\n(k0 , ~k, \u03bc0 , \u03bc\n~ ). Let C \u2217 (k0 , ~k, \u03bc0 , \u03bc\n~ ) denote the subset of anti-self-dual caloron configurations modulo gauge. When the boundary data is SU (n) we restrict C and C \u2217 to SU (n)\n\nconfigurations.\n\nIt is convenient at this point to compare our boundary conditions for calorons with\nthe 'BPS' decay conditions used in [13]. Given a framed bundle (E, f ), we can extend f\nto a neighbourhood of the boundary \u2202X, and perform the \"3 + 1\" decomposition (1.37)\nto define a loop of connections A on E over this neighbourhood, and a loop of endomorphisms \u03a6. Garland and Murray [13] impose the condition that A and \u03a6 satisfy\n41\n\n\fthe 'BPS' boundary conditions for monopoles uniformly in x0 . (Various versions of the\n'BPS' monopole boundary conditions exist: see [31] and [16] for example.) For a C\u03c70,1\nframed caloron, \u2207yj \u03a6 and \u2202x0 Aj are O(\u03c7) as \u03c7 \u2192 0, while \u2207\u03c7 \u03a6 and \u2202x0 A\u03c7 are O(1).\nUsing the form of the metric in equation (2.1) it follows that\nk\u2207A \u03a6k = O(\u03c72 )\n\nand k\u2202x0 Ak = O(\u03c72 )\n\nso\nk\u2207A \u03a6 \u2212 \u2202x0 Ak = O(\u03c72 ).\n\n(2.28)\n\nThis is a gauge invariant quantity-it does not depend on the choice of framing f . Thus\nour boundary conditions imply the following:\n\u2022 there are local gauges in which \u03a6 = diag(i\u03bc1 , . . . , i\u03bcn ) \u2212\n\n\u03c7\n2 diag(ik1 , . . . , ikn )+\n\nhigher order terms,\n\n\u2022 k\u2207A \u03a6k = O(\u03c72 ),\n\u2022\n\n\u2202k\u03a6k\n\u2202yj\n\n= O(\u03c72 ) for j = 1, 2,\n\nand these estimates are uniform in x0 . But these conditions are just the BPS monopole\nboundary conditions described in [16].\n\n2.1.7\n\nChern-Weil theory\n\nGiven a caloron configuration A \u2208 C(k0 , ~k, \u03bc0 , ~\u03bc) on a framed bundle E, we will need\n\nthe 'Pontryagin integral'\nZ\n\n1\nS2\u03c0/\u03bc\n\u00d7B\n\nch2 (E, A) = \u2212\n3\n\n1\n8\u03c0 2\n\n0\n\nZ\n\n1\nS2\u03c0/\u03bc\n\u00d7B\n\n3\n\ntr FA \u2227 FA ,\n\n(2.29)\n\n0\n\nwhich we calculate in this section.

A similar result is obtained by regarding a\n\nSU (n) caloron as a L\u0302SU (n) monopole, evaluating the energy kF\u00c2 k2 + k\u2207\u00c2 \u03a6\u0302k2 , and\nperforming the 'Bogomolny trick' (re-arranging in terms of k \u22173 F\u00c2 \u2212 \u2207\u00c2 \u03a6\u0302k).\n\n2.2\n\nThe rotation map\n\nUp to this point we have considered two caloron configurations to be equivalent if\nrelated by a strictly periodic bundle isomorphism, or, in other words, we have taken\n43\n\n\fmn\u22121 = k0 + . . . + kn\u22121\n\nm0 = k0\n\nmn\u22122 = k0 + . . . + kn\u22122\nm1 = k0 + k1\n\n\u2732 \u03be\n\n\u03bcn\n\n\u03bcn\u22121\n\n\u03bcn\u22122 . . . \u03bc2\n\n\u03bc1\n\n\u03bc0 + \u03bcn\n\n\u03bc0 + \u03bcn\u22121\n\nFigure 2.1: Typical U (n) Nahm data\ngauge transformations to be strictly periodic. However, we can consider 'large' gauge\ntransformations-transformations that are non-periodic but leave the caloron strictly\nperiodic. In the quasi-periodic picture, these are equivalent to bundle automorphisms\nof Eq that are not necessarily the identity at infinity, and such gauge transformations\naffect the framing (recall the final paragraph of Section 2.1.4). We therefore expect a\nlarge gauge transformation (if such an object exists) to be a map between calorons with\ndifferent framings, and possibly with different boundary data.\nOn the other hand, consider a caloron constructed from some set of Nahm data. (For\nthe present we assume we have a construction like that conjectured in the Introduction.)\nThe choice of origin on the circle T \u2217 = S\u03bc10 = R/\u03bc0 Z should have no effect on the caloron\nconstructed from the Nahm data (as a connection over R4 ) because the inner product\ndefined on sections of the Nahm data is independent of the origin. However, changing\nthe origin does change the values \u03bc1 , . . . , \u03bcn and therefore the framing of the caloron\nobtained. The Nahm construction gives a connection over R4 which we quotient by\n1\nsome action of Z to obtain a framed connection on S2\u03c0/\u03bc\n\u00d7 R3 , and there is some\n0\n\nfreedom as to how we take the quotient and make the framing. The choice of origin\n\nfor the circle T \u2217 = S\u03bc10 corresponds in some sense to a choice of the quotient and\nframing. Furthermore, calorons obtained by different quotients are related by large\ngauge transformations.\nAll this will be made rigorous later, but we can draw the following conclusion: given\na caloron with boundary data B we expect that by applying a large gauge transformation we can obtain a caloron with boundary data B \u2032 , where B and B \u2032 are related\nby shifting the origin on S\u03bc10 = R/\u03bc0 Z. We call this the 'rotation map' and prove its\nexistence in this Section. We will explore its relation to the Nahm transform later. Lee\n[26] has described the rotation map for calorons with vanishing monopole charges, and\nexplained it in representation theoretical terms [25].\n\n44\n\n\fm\u0303n\u22122\nm\u0303n\u22123\nm\u03030\nm\u0303n\u22121\n\u2732 \u03be\n\n\u03bc\u0303n\n\n\u03bc\u0303n\u22121\n\n\u03bc\u0303n\u22122\n\n\u03bc\u0303n\u22123 . . . \u03bc\u03031\n\n\u03bc0 + \u03bc\u0303n\n\n\u03bc0 + \u03bc\u0303n\u22121\n\nFigure 2.2: The same U (n) Nahm data after rotation\nFix a set of boundary data B = (k0 , ~k, \u03bc0 , ~\u03bc) and consider the following map:\n\u03bbp 7\u2192 \u03bbp+1 , mp 7\u2192 mp+1 , for p = 1, . . . , n \u2212 1,\n\u03bbn 7\u2192 \u03bb1 , mn 7\u2192 m1 ,\nwhere mp and \u03bbp are defined by (2.14) and (2.15).

Note that \u03c9 lies in the\n\ncentre of SU (n) and acts trivially as a bundle automorphism. The rotation map can\n\nbe thought of as an action of the centre of SU (n) (which is Zn ) on the space of SU (n)\ncaloron configurations. Next we extend \u03c1 arbitrarily (but smoothly) to the interior of\n3\n\nB to obtain a family of maps \u03c1(s) : E \u2192 E. Now \u03c1 defines a bundle automorphism of\nEq -but it does not necessarily define a (periodic) automorphism of E.\n\nConsider the action of \u03c1 on Aq . Our claim is that \u03c1(Aq ) is the pull-back of an\nelement of C(\u03c1\u2202 B): we have to show \u03c1(Aq ) is framed correctly and that it clutches\n\n2 ,\ncorrectly. Split Aq as Aq = A + \u03a6ds using the framing at infinity; we know that on S\u221e\n\nA(s) = A\u221e and \u03a6(s) = \u03a6\u221e . But \u03c1 acts on \u03a6 by\n\u03c1(\u03a6) = \u03c1\u03a6\u03c1\u22121 \u2212\n\n\u2202\u03c1 \u22121\n\u03c1 .\n\u2202s\n\nIt is easy to check that \u03c1(\u03a6)|S\u221e\n2 is independent of s and has eigenvalues i\u03bc\u03031 , . . . , i\u03bc\u0303n\ndefined by (2.33). Moreover the eigenbundle with eigenvalue i\u03bc\u0303j has Chern class k\u0303j ,\nso \u03c1(\u03a6) is framed in the desired manner. The map \u03c1 preserves the eigenbundles of\n\u03a6\u221e , and since A\u221e is compatible with the decomposition of E\u221e into eigenbundles,\n\u03c1(A)|S\u221e\n2 = A\u221e . Hence \u03c1(A) is also framed in the desired manner. It remains to show\nthat \u03c1(Aq ) clutches correctly.

We want to show deg c\u03c1 = k0 + k1 so that\n\u03c1 has the correct action on k0 . We do this indirectly by considering the action of the\n46\n\n\fcaloron configurations. The map \u03c1 is a bundle isomorphism on Eq so it preserves the\nquantity\n\n1\n8\u03c0 2\n\nUsing (2.32) this implies that\n\nZ\n\n[0,2\u03c0/\u03bc0 ]\u00d7B\n\n3\n\ntr FAq \u2227 FAq .\n\n\u03bc0 k0 + \u03bc1 k1 + * * * + \u03bcn kn = \u03bc0 deg c\u03c1 + \u03bc\u03031 k\u03031 + * * * + \u03bc\u0303n k\u0303n .\nHence deg c\u03c1 = k0 + k1 = k\u03030 , and this completes the proof of the claim.

Given\n(\u03be, i\u03bb) \u2208 L\u0302g, solutions h : R \u2192 G to\n\n\u2202h \u22121\nh = \u2212\u03bb\u22121 \u03be,\n\u2202\u03b8\n\nh(0) = 1\n\nsatisfy h(\u03b8 + 2\u03c0) = h(\u03b8)M\u03be for some M\u03be \u2208 G called the holonomy of (\u03be, i\u03bb). The map\nAdLG (\u03be, i\u03bb) 7\u2192 AdG M\u03be\nis an isomorphism between the adjoint orbits of LG on L\u0302g and conjugacy classes in G.\n47\n\n\fFix a L\u0302SU (n) monopole configuration \u00c2 = (A(\u03b8), 0), \u03a6\u0302 = (\u03a6(\u03b8), i\u03bc0 ) on a bundle\nE \u2192 R3 and let (E, A) be the corresponding caloron configuration so that E = p\u2217 E and\n\nA is given by (1.37). The boundary condition (2.35) says that there is a trivialisation\n\nof E|S\u221e\n2 in which \u03a6\u0302\u221e lies in an adjoint orbit of L\u0302SU (n). Since the adjoint action of\nL\u0302SU (n) is the action of LSU (n) followed by a rotation in \u03b8, the orbits of the two\ngroups are the same, because two elements of L\u0302g related by a rotation in \u03b8 have the\n2 , the holonomy map\nsame holonomy so lie in the same orbit of LG. For each y \u2208 S\u221e\n\ndefined in the Proposition takes \u03a6\u0302\u221e (y) \u2208 L\u0302su(n) to M (y) \u2208 SU (n) so that M (y) lies\n\nin a fixed conjugacy class of SU (n) as y varies. Thus\n\nM (y) = \u03b3(y)M\u0304 \u03b3 \u22121 (y)\n2 \u2192 SU (n)/Stab M\u0304 .\nfor some fixed M\u0304 which we can assume is diagonal, where \u03b3 : S\u221e\n\nDefine m\u0304 by\n\nM\u0304 = exp \u2212\nand let\n\n2\u03c0 m\u0304 \u0001\n\u03bc0\n\nm(y) = \u03b3(y)m\u0304\u03b3 \u22121 (y).\n(Note Stab M\u0304 = Stab m\u0304 because M\u0304 and m\u0304 are diagonal.) Clearly m(y) lies in a fixed\nadjoint orbit of SU (n) as y varies. By construction, the constant loop (m(y), i\u03bc0 ) \u2208\nL\u0302su(n) and \u03a6\u0302\u221e (y) have the same holonomy for each y, and so lie in the same adjoint\n\n2 \u2192 LSU (n)\norbit of LSU (n). In other words, there is a gauge transformation g : S\u221e\n\ntaking \u03a6\u0302\u221e to (m, i\u03bc0 ). Thus we have constructed a trivialisation of E|\u2202X in which\n2 \u2192 su(n) lies in a fixed adjoint orbit of SU (n) as y varies.\n\u03a6 = m where m : S\u221e\n\nSince a trivialisation at infinity is really a framing, the interpretation of (2.35) in\n\nterms of calorons can therefore be stated as follows:\ngiven a connection A on E there is a framing f : E|\u2202X \u2192 p\u2217 E in which\nA = A(x0 ) + p\u2217 \u03a6\u221e dx0\nwhere A(x0 ) is a loop of connections on E and \u03a6\u221e has eigenvalues indepen2 .\ndent of y \u2208 S\u221e\n\nIn other words, the dx0 component of A is framed at infinity. Comparing this with\nDefinition 2.10, we have successfully derived a weak version of the caloron boundary\nconditions from (2.35).\n\n48\n\n\fChapter 3\n\nFrom Nahm Data to Calorons\nWe present the construction of calorons from Nahm data. Section 3.1 contains material\nfrom [20] on the construction of SU (n) monopoles from Nahm data, including the\nprecise conditions imposed on the Nahm data at singularities, which we use in our\ndefinition of Nahm data for calorons. In Section 3.2 we prove that the connection\nconstructed from our caloron Nahm data is periodic and ASD. As we explained in\nSection 1.3, the main difficulty in the construction of calorons lies in recovering the\nboundary conditions. This occupies Sections 3.3 to 3.6 and follows the deformation\nmethod outlined in Section 1.3.\n\nThe Nahm transform for SU (n) monopoles\n\n3.1\n3.1.1\n\nNahm data for SU(n) monopoles.\n\nNahm data for SU (n) monopoles are defined in [20] and [19], and the following definition\nis taken almost directly from these papers. Given a set of boundary data (~k, ~\u03bc), define\nmp = k1 + * * * + kp for p = 1, . . . , n \u2212 1 and fix the conventions m0 = mn = 0. A set of\n\nmonopole Nahm data consists of the following:\n\nBundles: hermitian vector bundles Xp of rank mp on each interval Ip = [\u03bcp+1 , \u03bcp ] for\np = 1, . . . , n \u2212 1. We fix the conventions I0 = [\u03bc1 , \u221e), In = (\u2212\u221e, \u03bcn ] and take\nS\nX0 , Xn to be rank zero bundles. Let \u03be be a coordinate on Ip = R.\n\nConnections and endomorphisms: an analytic connection \u2207p on Ip and analytic\n\nskew-hermitian endomorphisms Tpj , j = 1, 2, 3, on the interior of Ip for each p =\n\n1, . . . , n \u2212 1. Note that the connection \u2207p is defined on an open neighbourhood\nof the closed interval Ip . The connection and endomorphisms satisfy Nahm's\n\nequation on the interior of each interval:\n\u2207p Tpi +\n\n1X\n\u01ebijk [Tpj , Tpk ] = 0.\n2\nj,k\n\nThe bundles Xp come with a means of gluing them together at each \u03bcp :\n49\n\n(3.1)\n\n\fWhen mp > mp\u22121 : an injection Xp\u22121 |\u03bcp \u0592\u2192 Xp |\u03bcp .\nWhen mp < mp\u22121 : an injection Xp |\u03bcp \u0592\u2192 Xp\u22121 |\u03bcp .\nWhen mp = mp\u22121 : an identification Xp |\u03bcp \u2194 Xp\u22121 |\u03bcp . We call this a zero jump.\nEach map preserves the hermitian structure. At each boundary point \u03bcp the data\nsatisfy the following boundary conditions:\nWhen mp > mp\u22121 : we require that for each j = 1, 2, 3,\nj\nj,+\nTp\u22121\n= lim Tp\u22121\n\u03be\u2192\u03bc+\np\n\nj\nexists and Tp\u22121\nis analytic at \u03bcp . Fix a parallel unitary basis for Xp\u22121 in a neigh-\n\nbourhood of \u03bcp . Using the injection into Xp this determines a unitary parallel\nbasis of a rank mp\u22121 sub-bundle of Xp in a neighbourhood of \u03bcp , which we can\nextend to a unitary parallel basis of Xp . In this gauge there is a decomposition:\n\u271b\n\nTpj =\n\n\u2732\u271b\n\nmp\u22121\n\nkp\n\n\u2732\n\nj,+\nTp\u22121\n+ O(t)\n\nO(t(kp \u22121)/2 )\n\nO(t(kp \u22121)/2 )\n\nRpj /t + O(1)\n\n!\n\n\u273bmp\u22121\n\u2744\n\u273b\n\u2744kp\n\nwhere the upper diagonal block corresponds to the image of Xp\u22121 in Xp . The\nupper diagonal block is analytic in t = \u03be \u2212 \u03bcp ; the lower diagonal block is meromorphic in t; and the off-diagonal blocks are of the form t(kp \u22121)/2 \u00d7(analytic in t).\n\nThe residues Rpj define an irreducible representation of su(2): in particular the\nmap\n\u03c1 : \u03bb1 \u03b31 + \u03bb2 \u03b32 + \u03bb3 \u03b33 7\u2192 \u22122(\u03bb1 Rp1 + \u03bb2 Rp2 + \u03bb3 Rp3 )\n\n(3.2)\n\nis the unique irreducible representation S kp \u22121 on homogeneous polynomials in\n\n(z0 , z1 ) of degree kp \u2212 1, where the \u03b3j are defined by (1.9).\n\nWhen mp < mp\u22121 : the situation is just the previous case but with Xp and Xp\u22121\nswapped round.\nWhen mp = mp\u22121 : working in a gauge that is parallel either side of the join and\nj\ncontinuous across the join, we require that limits Tpj,\u2212 of Tpj and Tpj,+ of Tp\u22121\n\nexist. Setting\nA\u00b1 (\u03b6) = (Tp2,\u00b1 + iTp3,\u00b1 ) + (2iTp1,\u00b1 )\u03b6 + (Tp2,\u00b1 \u2212 iTp3,\u00b1 )\u03b6 2\nwe require that for all \u03b6 \u2208 C\nA+ (\u03b6) \u2212 A\u2212 (\u03b6) = (u \u2212 w\u03b6)(w\u2217 + u\u2217 \u03b6)\n50\n\n\ffor some mp -dimensional column vectors u, w.

A gauge transformation g1 , . . . , gn acts on \u2207p by \u2207p 7\u2192 g\u2207p g\u22121 and on\n\nTpj by Tpj 7\u2192 gTpj g\u22121 .\n\n\u2217 (~\nDefinition 3.3. Let NMon\nk, ~\u03bc) be the space of gauge equivalence classes of monopole\nNahm data with boundary data (~k, \u03bc\n~ ).\n\n3.1.2\n\nDefinition of the Nahm operator \u2206\n\nThe next task is to show how to construct the analogue of the Dirac operator Dx+ from\na set of monopole Nahm data. Consider adopting a na\u0131\u0308ve approach to generalizing the\n4-torus Nahm transform to the monopole case, as we did in Section 1.1.6. Dimensional\nreduction of the Dirac operator Dx+ by \u039b\u2217 = R3 gives an operator\n\u2207+\n\n3\nX\nj=1\n\n\u03b3j \u2297 Tj \u2212 ix0 \u2212 i\n\n3\nX\nj=1\n\n\u03b3j \u2297 xj : C \u221e (R, \u015c + \u2297 X) \u2192 C \u221e (R, \u015c \u2212 \u2297 X)\n\n(3.4)\n\nwhere \u2207 is a connection on a bundle X \u2192 R, and T1 , T2 , T3 are skew-adjoint endomor-\n\nphisms of X, satisfying Nahm's equation. Of course, this picture is not quite correct,\n\nsince the rank of the 'bundle' may jump, but using (3.4) and the definition of the Nahm\ndata it is clear how to define Dx+ on the interior of the intervals Ip . We call the analogue of Dx+ the Nahm operator , \u2206(x). In fact, following conventions in the monopole\nliterature, we introduce a factor of i and define \u2206(x) to be the analogue of i \u00d7 Dx+ .\n\nSome care is needed at the points \u03be = \u03bcp in the definition of \u2206(x). In particular, we\nwant to ensure that \u2206(x) is Fredholm with index \u2212n and is injective for all x \u2208 R4 , so\n\nthat the cokernel of \u2206(x) defines a rank n bundle over R4 . If we can construct \u2206(x)\nwith these properties then we can make the following definition:\nDefinition 3.5. Suppose \u2206(x) : W \u2192 V is a family of bounded linear maps between\n\nHilbert spaces W, V , parameterized by x \u2208 R4 , such that \u2206(x) is injective, Fredholm,\n\nand has index \u2212n for all x. Define Coker \u2206 to be the U (n) bundle over R4 with fibre\ncoker \u2206(x), equipped with the connection\n\nP *d\nwhere P is orthogonal projection from V onto coker \u2206(x) for each x, and d is the\nstandard covariant derivative on the trivial bundle V \u00d7 R4 . If v1 , . . . , vn is a local\n51\n\n\ftrivialisation of Coker \u2206, then in this gauge the connection is represented by matrices\n(Aa )ij = h\u2202a vi , vj i\n\n(3.6)\n\nfor a = 0, 1, 2, 3.\nTo see that Coker \u2206 is a smooth bundle we find a trivialisation on a neighbourhood\nof the origin in R4 . First note that coker \u2206(x) = ker \u2206\u2217 (x) for all x. Identifying\nker \u2206\u2217 (0) with Cn , there is a decomposition\n\u2206\u2217 (0) = (P0 , 0) : V \u2032 \u2295 Cn \u2192 W\nwhere V = V \u2032 \u2295 Cn and P0 is invertible. Relative to this decomposition of V we can\n\nwrite \u2206\u2217 (x) = (Px , Qx ) where Px is invertible for sufficiently small x. The null-space\nof \u2206\u2217 (x) is a graph over Cn :\n\u2206\u2217 (x)(u, v) = 0\n\n\u21d2\n\nu = \u2212Px\u22121 Qx v.\n\nThus the map\nv 7\u2192 (\u2212Px\u22121 Qx v, v)\nis a smooth isomorphism from Cn to ker \u2206\u2217 (x) for all sufficiently small x. The same\nargument gives a trivialisation round an arbitrary point, and the transition between\ndifferent trivialisations is smooth.\nWorking with some fixed set of U (n) monopole Nahm data, let Xp , p = 1, . . . , n \u2212 1,\n\nbe the corresponding vector bundles. Using the trivialisations of the spin spaces \u015c +\n\nand \u015c \u2212 fixed by (1.9) we identify \u015c + , \u015c \u2212 with C2 throughout this Chapter. Let Yp =\nC2 \u2297 Xp . Let Wpl be the Sobolev space of sections of Yp with l derivatives in L2 , where\n\nthe L2 inner product (conjugate linear in the second entry) is defined by\nZ\nhv, wid\u03be\nhv, wiL2 =\nIp\n\nfor v, w \u2208 Wp0 . Also define L2l (Ip ) to be the Sobolev space of functions on Ip with l\n\nderivatives in L2 . Often we will just write h, i where we mean the L2 inner product or\nthe pairing between elements in dual Sobolev spaces.\n\nOne has to be slightly careful when defining spaces of distributions on manifolds with\nboundary due to the different choices that can be made when taking completions. It will\nbe more apparent why this concerns us when we consider dual spaces in Section 3.2.3.\nThese subtleties are dealt with in H\u00f6rmander's book [18, Appendix B2], and we will\nadopt his notation. Let\nL\u03042l [a, b] = L2l (R)/ \u223c\nwhere\nf \u223c g \u21d4 hf \u2212 g, vi = 0 \u2200v \u2208 L2\u2212l (R) such that Supp v \u2282 [a, b]\n52\n\n\fand\nL\u03072l [a, b] = {v \u2208 L2l (R) : Supp v \u2282 [a, b]}.\nIt follows immediately that L\u03042l [a, b] is the dual of L\u03072\u2212l [a, b], where the pairing is given\nby the L2 inner product. We define Wpl to consist of L\u03042l (Ip ) sections of Yp , and in what\nfollows we will often just write L2l to mean L\u03042l on a manifold with boundary. Note that\ndifferentiation is a well-defined map\nd\n: L\u03042l [a, b] \u2192 L\u03042l\u22121 [a, b]\ndt\nsince if f \u223c g then\n\ndf\ndg\ndv\n\u2212 , vi = hf \u2212 g, i = 0\ndt\ndt\ndt\n2\nfor all v \u2208 L1\u2212l (R) supported on [a, b]. Also note that if f \u2208 L\u030421 [a, b] then the values\nh\n\nf (a) and f (b) are well defined: by the Sobolev embedding theorem each representative\n\nof f is continuous, and any two representatives must agree on [a, b]. This ends the\ntechnical aside on the definition of the Sobolev spaces, and we return to the definition\nof the Nahm operator.\nWe adopt the following terminology from [20]. Suppose mp \u2265 mp\u22121 . At the bound-\n\nary point \u03bcp of [\u03bcp+1 , \u03bcp ], Yp decomposes as a direct sum Yp (\u03bcp ) = Yp\u22121 (\u03bcp )\u2295Yp\u22121 (\u03bcp )\u22a5\n\nusing the inclusion of Xp\u22121 (\u03bcp ) into Xp (\u03bcp ). We call vectors in the first component\n'continuing', and vectors in the second component 'terminating'. If mp \u2264 mp\u22121 then\n\nall the vectors in Yp (\u03bcp ) are continuing. We adopt similar terminology at the other end\nof the interval. See Figure 1.2 for an illustration.\n\u25e6\n\nLet W 1p \u2282 Wp1 be the subset of sections of Yp whose terminating components vanish\n\nat both ends of the interval (this definition makes sense following the remark above\nabout L\u030421 functions). Define\n\u25e6\n\nDp (x) : W 1p \u2192 Wp0\nDp (x) = i\u2207p + iTp + x\nwhere\nTp =\n\n3\nX\nj=1\n\nand\n\nx = x0 +\n\n\u03b3j \u2297 Tpj ,\n\n3\nX\nj=1\n\n\u03b3j \u2297 x j .\n\nThen Dp is well defined since the component of the section acted on by the singular\npart of T is zero: using the Cauchy Schwartz inequality one obtains\nk(\u03be \u2212 \u03bcp )\u22121 f kL2 \u2264 Ckf kL21\nfor any function f \u2208 L\u030421 (Ip ) vanishing at \u03bcp .\n53\n\n\fThe zero jumps need special consideration. Let \u03be = \u03bcq be a zero jump (i.e. suppose\nmq = mq\u22121 ). The boundary condition on the Nahm data at a zero jump fixes a 1\n(complex-)dimensional subspace of Yq (\u03bcq ), which we denote Jq (the 'jumping space' at\n\u03bcq ). For each zero jump we fix an element \u03b6q of Jq with norm 1, and let\n\u03c0q (w) = hw(\u03bcq ), \u03b6q i\n\n(3.7)\n\nfor any continuous section w of Yq . Let J be the set of zero jumps\nJ = {q : mq = mq\u22121 }\nand let Nzero = |J |.\n\nWe are now in a position to define the Nahm operator \u2206(x) : W \u2192 V . Let\n\u25e6\n\n\u25e6\n\nW = {(w1 , . . . , wn\u22121 ) \u2208 W 11 \u2295 * * * \u2295 W 1n\u22121 : wp (\u03bcp ) = wp\u22121 (\u03bcp ) for p = 2, . . . , n \u2212 1}\n\n(3.8)\n\nand\n0\nV = W10 \u2295 * * * \u2295 Wn\u22121\n\u2295 CNzero .\n\n(3.9)\n\nThe Nahm operator \u2206 is the direct sum of the Dp operators, together with the projection at each zero jump:\n\u2206(x) : W \u2192 V,\n\u2206(x)w = [D1 (x)w1 , . . . , Dn\u22121 (x)wn\u22121 ] \u2295 [\u03c0w].\nThe map \u03c0 : W \u2192 CNzero has components \u03c0q for q \u2208 J . Note that we deal with\n\nthe zero jumps slightly differently from Hurtubise and Murray. Instead of CNzero their\nL\nprojection \u03c0 maps into\nJq -we fix a basis for this space (the \u03b6q ), and work in this\n\nbasis. At some stages we will need to deform the projections \u03c0q ; with our set-up the\ndeformed operator will still be a map W \u2192 V , whereas with Hurtubise and Murray's\n\nversion, the spaces would change with the deformation, which would cause problems.\nWe have to check that Coker \u2206 is independent of the choice of \u03b6q : making a different\n\nchoice for the \u03b6q is just equivalent to a unitary change of basis in CNzero . Hence the\nchoice of \u03b6q does not affect Coker \u2206 up to isomorphism.\n\n3.1.3\n\nResults from Hurtubise and Murray\n\nGiven a Nahm operator \u2206(x) : W \u2192 V constructed from a set of U (n) monopole Nahm\n\ndata, Hurtubise and Murray prove the following results in [20]:\n\n\u2022 \u2206(x) is injective and has index \u2212n for all x i.e. Coker \u2206 is well-defined (recall\nDefinition 3.5),\n\n\u2022 Nahm's equation implies that Coker \u2206 is anti-self-dual,\n54\n\n\f\u2022 Coker \u2206 is a translation invariant U (n) bundle and connection, and\n\u2022 Coker \u2206 satisfies the monopole boundary conditions.\nIn other words, they show that the Nahm transform takes a set of monopole Nahm\ndata and produces a monopole. Since Hurtubise and Murray assume weaker boundary\nconditions for monopoles than we do, we cannot assume that the Nahm transform on\nan element of N \u2217 (~k, \u03bc\n~ ) gives a monopole configuration as defined by Definition 2.4.\nMon\n\nThus we must state precisely which results from [20] we are free to assume. We assume:\n\nLemma 3.10. If \u2206(x) is the Nahm operator constructed from some set of U (n) mono\u2217 (~\npole Nahm data in NMon\nk, ~\n\u03bc) then \u2206(x) is injective and Fredholm with index \u2212n for\nall x \u2208 R4 .\n\nLemma 3.11. Under the same assumptions as Lemma 3.10,\nZ\n1\nch2 Coker \u2206 = \u2212 (\u03bc1 k1 + * * * + \u03bcn kn ).\n\u03bc0\n[0,2\u03c0/\u03bc0 ]\u00d7R3\n(This is just equation (2.32) except with k0 = 0 since Coker \u2206 is a monopole configuration.)\nBoth Lemmas are implicit in [20].\nLater on it will be useful to consider Nahm data that does not satisfy Nahm's\nequation. In addition, it is useful to drop the requirement that the Nahm data is\ndiscontinuous accross zero jumps. We therefore make the following definition:\nDefinition 3.12. The space NMon (~k, ~\u03bc) consists of gauge equivalence classes of Nahm\ndata with boundary data (~k, ~\n\u03bc), such that the data does not necessarily satisfy Nahm's\nequation. Moreover, at a zero jump \u03be = \u03bcq , either\n1. the endomorphisms T 1 , T 2 , T 3 are discontinuous, as described previously, or\n2. the endomorphisms are continuous, but there is still a projection operator \u03c0q and\nsome 1-dimensional subspace Jq \u2282 Yq (\u03bcq ) associated to the zero jump.\nSome of the results of Hurtubise and Murray continue to hold for this wider class\nof data. In particular, it is easy to check that the proof of Lemma 3.10 still holds. We\nwill also assume that Lemma 3.11 holds for data in NMon (~k, \u03bc\n~ ): this does not follow\n\nfrom Hurtubise and Murray's results, but we will give a proof later. Since we will not\nrequire Nahm's equation to hold most of the time, we will refer to data from NMon (~k, ~\n\u03bc)\nas 'monopole Nahm data' and point out where we use Nahm's equation specifically.\n\n55\n\n\f3.2\n3.2.1\n\nThe construction of calorons up to boundary conditions\nDefinition of caloron Nahm data\n\nA set of U (n) caloron Nahm data with boundary data (k0 , ~k, \u03bc0 , \u03bc\n~ ) consists of n bundles\nX1 , . . . , Xn over the intervals Ip \u2282 S\u03bc10 = R/\u03bc0 Z defined by (1.41). The rank of Xp\n\nis mp , where mp is defined by (2.14). The bundles are equipped with exactly the\nsame structures as monopole Nahm data, and glued together in the same way at each\n\u03bcp + \u03bc0 Z, p = 1, . . . , n. Note that X1 is glued to Xn at \u03bc1 + \u03bc0 Z, and the data satisfy\nexactly the same gluing conditions there. The gauge transformations are also defined\nin an entirely analogous way.\nNext we have to build the Nahm operator \u2206(x) : W \u2192 V from this data. This is\n\u25e6\n\nentirely analogous to the monopole case in Section 3.1.2. Define Wp0 , W 1p , and Dp for\np = 1, . . . , n in the same way as in Section 3.1.2. Label the zero jumps by q \u2208 J , and\ndefine Jq , \u03b6q , \u03c0q and Nzero just as previously. Then\n\u25e6\n\n\u25e6\n\nW = {(w1 , . . . , wn ) \u2208 W 11 \u2295 * * * \u2295 W 1n : wp (\u03bcp ) = wp\u22121 (\u03bcp ) for p = 2, . . . , n\nand w1 (\u03bc1 ) = wn (\u03bc1 \u2212 \u03bc0 )}. (3.13)\nIn other words, W consists of sections that are continuous around the circle. Let\nV = [W10 \u2295 * * * \u2295 Wn0 ] \u2295 [CNzero ]\nand\n\u2206(x) : W \u2192 V,\n\u2206(x)w = [D1 (x)w1 , . . . , Dn (x)wn ] \u2295 [\u03c0w].\n\n(3.14)\n\nIn the monopole case every Nahm operator \u2206(x) built from Nahm data was injective:\nHurtubise-Murray prove this by showing\nk\u2206(x)f k2 = k\u2207p f k2 + positive terms.\nThus any element of the kernel of \u2206(x) has to be constant, and the vanishing condition\nat the end points \u03bc1 and \u03bcn ensures that any such section is trivial. (In fact this is a\nslight over-simplification because zero jumps also have to be taken into account.) This\nproof does not carry over to the caloron case: there could exist covariantly constant\nsections of the bundles that remain in the continuing component at each \u03bcp . It is quite\neasy to construct examples of caloron Nahm data satisfying our definition that do not\ngive rise to injective Nahm operators: for example take a set of U (n) monopole Nahm\ndata and glue on a rank k0 bundle over S\u03bc10 equipped with the trivial connection and\nendomorphisms. This satifies the conditions to be a valid set of caloron Nahm data,\n56\n\n\fbut the Nahm operator is not injective for all x. Thus we restrict to sets of Nahm data\nthat do give rise to injective operators:\nDefinition 3.15. Let N \u2217 (k0 , ~k, \u03bc0 , \u03bc\n~ ) be the set of gauge equivalence classes of U (n)\ncaloron Nahm data satisfying Nahm's equation, and with boundary data (k0 , ~k, \u03bc0 , ~\u03bc),\nsuch that the Nahm operator \u2206(x) is injective for all x \u2208 R4 .\nIt is useful to also consider caloron Nahm data that does not satisfy Nahm's equation. We therefore define N (k0 , ~k, \u03bc0 , ~\u03bc) analogously to Definition 3.12. In general, we\nwill refer to data in N (k0 , ~k, \u03bc0 , \u03bc\n~ ) as 'caloron Nahm data' and point out where we\nspecifically require Nahm's equation and discontinuities at zero jumps.\nWe will sometimes use the following terminology:\nDefinition 3.16. A set of caloron Nahm data is principal if it has principal boundary\ndata (in the sense of Definition 2.13).\n\n3.2.2\n\nThe index of \u2206\n\nGiven a set of caloron Nahm data and the corresponding Nahm operator \u2206(x) : W \u2192 V ,\nwe want to show that Coker \u2206 is well-defined i.e. we want to show that \u2206(x) is Fredholm\n\nwith index \u2212n for all x. (Recall that \u2206(x) is injective by definition.) The calculation\nof the index is an adaptation of the SU (n) monopole version [20, Section 4].\n\nTo calculate the index of \u2206(x) we want to identify the kernel and cokernel, and\ncount dimensions. It is clear that the kernel of \u2206(x) consists of (w1 , . . . , wn ) \u2208 W\nsatisfying\n\n\u2022 Dp (x)wp = 0, and\n\u2022 at zero jumps wq (\u03bcq ) is in Jq\u22a5\nin addition to the constraints on W (i.e. that terminating components vanish at \u03bcp\nwhere kp 6= 0 and that continuing components are continuous at any \u03bcp ). To find the\n\ncokernel we integrate by parts. Fix (w1 , . . . , wn ) \u2208 W and\n\nn\nM\nWp0 ] \u2295 [CNzero ].\nv = (v1 , . . . , vn ) \u2295 s \u2208 V = [\n\n(3.17)\n\np=1\n\nThen\nhv, \u2206(x)wi =\n\nn\nX\nX\nhsq \u03b6q , wq (\u03bcq )i\nhvp , Dp (x)wp iL2 +\np=1\n\n(3.18)\n\nq\u2208J\n\nand v \u2208 coker \u2206(x) if and only if this vanishes for all w. If we assume that wp (\u03bcp ) = 0\n\nand wp is smooth for all p, then integration by parts of the first sum makes sense, and\nwe obtain\n\nn\nX\nhDp\u2217 (x)vp , wp iL2\nhv, \u2206(x)wi =\np=1\n\n57\n\n\fwhere\nDp\u2217 (x) = i\u2207p \u2212 iTp + x\u2217 .\n(If we do not assume wp (\u03bcp ) = 0 for all p then problems arise because vp (\u03bcp ) may not\nbe well-defined and the boundary contribution in the parts integration may not make\nsense.) Hence vp must satisfy Dp\u2217 (x)vp = 0 for all p. It follows that vp is smooth on\nthe interior of Ip , and the continuing components of vp are continuous up to the ends\nof the interval. Under these conditions integrating (3.18) by parts makes sense for all\nw, and we obtain\nn\nn\nX\nX\ncont\n\u2217\nihvp\u22121\n(\u03bcp ) \u2212 vpcont (\u03bcp ), wp (\u03bcp )i\nhDp (x)vp , wp iL2 +\nhv, \u2206(x)wi =\np=1\n\np=1\n\n+\n\nX\n\nq\u2208J\n\nhsq \u03b6q , wq (\u03bcq )i\n\nwhere vpcont is the continuing component of vp . Then v \u2208 coker \u2206(x) iff\n\u2022 Dp\u2217 (x)vp = 0 on each interval Ip for p = 1, . . . , n,\n\u2022 the continuing components are continuous at each \u03bcp where kp 6= 0, and\n\u2022 at zero jumps, vq (\u03bcq ) \u2212 vq\u22121 (\u03bcq ) = \u2212isq \u03b6q .\nTo count the number of solutions in the kernel and cokernel we need some analysis\nof Dp (x) and Dp\u2217 (x) close to the singular points \u03be = \u03bcp . This is taken more-or-less\ndirectly from Hitchin's paper on the construction of monopoles [17, Section 2]. Start by\nconsidering the case kp > 0, and recall the conditions imposed on the endomorphisms\nTpj at such a point. Let t = \u03be \u2212 \u03bcp be a coordinate in a neighbourhood of \u03bcp . For\n\nt \u2208 (\u2212\u01eb, 0) we have in some parallel gauge the block decomposition\n\u0012\n\u0013\nX\n0\n0\nj\n\u03b3j \u2297 Tp =\n+ B(t)\n0 Rp /t\nwhere B(t) is analytic and bounded, and Rp =\n\u03c1 defined by (3.2),\nRp = \u2212\n\nP\n\n\u03b3j \u2297Rpj . In terms of the representation\n\n1X\n\u03b3j \u2297 \u03c1(\u03b3j ).\n2\n\nIt is possible to express Rp in terms of Casimir operators. If S is a representation of\nP\nsu(2) then the Casimir operator is defined by C(S) = j \u03c1(\u03b3j )2 . Now\nC(S 1 \u2297 S kp \u22121 ) = 1 \u2297 C(S kp \u22121 ) + 2\n\nso\n\nX\n\n\u03b3j \u2297 \u03c1(\u03b3j ) + C(S 1 ) \u2297 1\n\n1\nRp = \u2212 [C(S 1 \u2297 S kp \u22121 ) \u2212 1 \u2297 C(S kp \u22121 ) \u2212 C(S 1 ) \u2297 1].\n4\n58\n\n\fThe Casimir operator on S kp is \u2212kp (kp + 2) * id, and decomposing into irreducibles we\nhave S 1 \u2297 S kp \u22121 \u223c\n= S kp \u2295 S kp \u22122 . Hence\nRp =\nand\n\n1\n(kp \u2212 1) on S kp \u2282 S 1 \u2297 S kp \u22121\n2\n\n(3.19)\n\n1\nRp = \u2212 (kp + 1) on S kp \u22122 \u2282 S 1 \u2297 S kp \u22121 .\n2\n\nNow let Up be the 2mp dimensional space of solutions to Dp on Ip . Using the block\ndecomposition of Dp and the calculation of Rp , we see that Up decomposes as Up =\nBp \u2295 Gp \u2295 Cp where\n\u2022 Bp is the kp +1 dimensional space of solutions that are O(t\u2212(kp \u22121)/2 ) corresponding\nto elements of S kp ,\n\n\u2022 Gp is the kp \u22121 dimensional space of solutions that are O(t(kp +1)/2 ) corresponding\nto elements of S kp \u22122 , and\n\n\u2022 Cp is the 2mp\u22121 dimensional space of solutions that are O(t0 ) corresponding to\nelements of the other diagonal block.\n\nThe solutions in Bp do not have vanishing terminating component and are not L2\n\u25e6\n\nso cannot be elements of W p . (Here 'B' is for 'bad', 'G' is for 'good' and 'C' is for\n'continuing'. The 'bad' solutions are the ones that cannot be in ker \u2206(x).)\nNext consider the cases kp < 0 and kp = 0: the same decomposition of Up exists, but\nBp and Gp are trivial because all solutions are in the continuing block. Alternatively,\none can decompose Up depending on the behaviour of solutions at the other end of the\ninterval, and obtain Up = B\u0302p \u2295 \u011cp \u2295 \u0108p . If kp+1 \u2265 0 then B\u0302p and \u011cp are trivial, but\nwhen kp+1 < 0 we have\n\n\u2022 B\u0302p is the 1 \u2212 kp+1 dimensional space of solutions that are O(t(1+kp+1 )/2 ) corresponding to elements of S |kp+1 | ,\n\n\u2022 \u011cp is the \u22121 \u2212 kp+1 dimensional space of solutions that are O(t(1\u2212kp+1 )/2 ) corresponding to elements of S |kp+1 |\u22122 , and\n\n\u2022 \u0108p is the 2mp+1 dimensional space of solutions that are O(t0 ) corresponding to\nelements of the other diagonal block.\n\nFor these estimates we have taken t = \u03be \u2212 \u03bcp+1 . For u \u2208 Up let Bp u, Gp u, Cp u etc.\ndenote the projections with respect to the decomposition.\n\nWe can perform exactly the same kind of analysis for Dp\u2217 . Let Up\u2217 be the 2mp\ndimensional space of solutions to Dp\u2217 (at the moment the '\u2217' is just a label-but in fact\nUp\u2217 will turn out to be the dual of Up ). We obtain decompositions Up\u2217 = Bp\u2217 \u2295 G\u2217p \u2295 Cp\u2217\n59\n\n\fand Up\u2217 = B\u0302p\u2217 \u2295 \u011c\u2217p \u2295 \u0108p\u2217 . In particular when kp > 0 we choose Bp\u2217 to correspond to\n\nelements of S kp so that it contains solutions that are O(t(kp \u22121)/2 ), and when kp+1 < 0\nwe choose B\u0302p\u2217 to correspond to elements of S |kp+1 | so that it contains solutions that are\n\nO(t\u2212(1+kp+1 )/2 ). When kp \u2264 0 Bp\u2217 is trivial, and similarly for B\u0302p\u2217 when kp+1 \u2265 0. Now\n\nsuppose u \u2208 Up , w \u2208 Up\u2217 for some fixed p. Then hu, wi(\u03be) is well defined for any \u03be in the\n\ninterior of Ip because the elements of Up and Up\u2217 are necessarily smooth on the interior.\nBut because u and w are solutions to Dp and Dp\u2217 ,\nvector space dual of Up , with the pairing\n\nd\nd\u03be hu, wi(\u03be)\n\n= 0 so Up\u2217 really is the\n\nhu, widual = (\u03bcp \u2212 \u03bcp+1 )\u22121 hu, wiL2 = hu, wi(\u03be) for any \u03be in the interior of Ip .\nMoreover, because the solutions in Bp and Bp\u2217 correspond to elements of S kp , Bp\u2217 is the\n\ndual of Bp , and similarly for G\u2217p and Cp\u2217 . Hence\n\nhu, widual = hBp u, Bp\u2217 widual + hGp u, G\u2217p widual + hCp u, Cp\u2217 widual\n\n(3.20)\n\nwhere\nhBp u, Bp\u2217 widual = hBp u, Bp\u2217 wi(\u03be)\nfor any \u03be in the interior of Ip etc. Note that\nhCp u, Cp\u2217 widual = hCp u, Cp\u2217 wi(\u03bcp ) = hCp u, Cp\u2217 wi(\u03bcp+1 )\nbecause the values at the end-points are well defined. We obtain a similar expression\nto (3.20) using the decomposition of Up at the other end of the interval, in terms of B\u0302p ,\n\u011cp , and \u0108p .\nThe boundary conditions for the kernel and cokernel can be stated in terms of\nthese decompositions. Suppose up \u2208 Up and up\u22121 \u2208 Up\u22121 satisfy the conditions to\nbe in the kernel at \u03bcp . This is equivalent to saying Bp up = 0 = B\u0302p\u22121 up\u22121 (so that\n\nthe terminating components vanish), that Cp up (\u03bcp ) = \u0108p\u22121 up\u22121 (\u03bcp ) (the continuing\ncomponents are continuous), and at zero jumps Cq uq (\u03bcq ) \u2208 Jq\u22a5 . Similarly, suppose\n\u2217\nsatisfy the conditions to be in the cokernel at \u03bcp . This\nwp \u2208 Up\u2217 and wp\u22121 \u2208 Up\u22121\n\nis equivalent to saying G\u2217p wp = 0 = \u011c\u2217p\u22121 wp\u22121 (so that wp and wp\u22121 are L2 ), that at\n\n\u2217 w\npoints \u03bcp where kp 6= 0 we have Cp\u2217 wp (\u03bcp ) = \u0108p\u22121\np\u22121 (\u03bcp ) (the continuing components\n\u2217 w\nare continuous), and at zero jumps \u03bcq , Cq\u2217 wq (\u03bcq ) \u2212 \u0108q\u22121\nq\u22121 (\u03bcq ) \u2208 Jq .\n\nTo find the index of \u2206(x) we introduce a map \u0398 between finite dimensional vector\n\nspaces whose index is easy to compute, but constructed so that ker \u2206(x) = ker \u0398\nand coker \u2206(x) = coker \u0398. Let Uppairs \u2282 Up \u00d7 Up\u22121 be the set of pairs (up , \u00fbp\u22121 )\n\nsatisfying the boundary conditions for the kernel of \u2206(x) at \u03bcp for p = 2, . . . , n, and\n\nlet U1pairs \u2282 U1 \u00d7 Un in the same way. Consider the map\n\u0398:\n\nn\nM\np=1\n\nUppairs \u2192\n\nn\nM\n\nUp\n\np=1\n\n\u0398 : (u1 , \u00fbn ), (u2 , \u00fb1 ), . . . , (un , \u00fbn\u22121 ) 7\u2192 (u1 \u2212 \u00fb1 ), (u2 \u2212 \u00fb2 ), . . . , (un \u2212 \u00fbn ).\n60\n\n\fBy construction, the kernel of \u0398 is the kernel of \u2206(x). Also\nind \u0398 =\n\nX\n\nX\n\ndim Uppairs \u2212\n\ndim Up .\n\nChecking each case (kp > 0, kp = 0, and kp < 0) we have dim Uppairs = mp + mp\u22121 \u2212 1\n\nwhile dim Up = 2mp . Hence ind \u0398 = \u2212n. If we can show the annihilator of im \u0398 is\n\ncoker \u2206(x) then we can conclude that ind \u2206(x) = \u2212n\nFix\n\nu = ((u1 , \u00fbn ), (u2 , \u00fb1 ), . . . , (un , \u00fbn\u22121 )) \u2208\nand\nw = (w1 , . . . , wn ) \u2208\n\nn\nM\n\nn\nM\n\nUppairs\n\np=1\n\nUp\u2217\n\np=1\n\nThen\nh\u0398u, widual =\n=\n\nX\np\n\nX\np\n\nhup \u2212 \u00fbp , wp idual\n[hCp up , Cp\u2217 wp idual + hGp up , G\u2217p wp idual\n\u2212 h\u0108p \u00fbp , \u0108p\u2217 wp idual \u2212 h\u011cp \u00fbp , \u011c\u2217p wp idual ]\n\nusing (3.20) (plus its analogous version in terms of B\u0302p , \u011cp , \u0108p ) and the fact that Bp up =\n0 = B\u0302p \u00fbp .

The proof of Lemma\nCorollary 3.26. Suppose \u2206\n \u0303 and so \u2206(x)\n \u0303\n3.22 applies to \u2206,\nis Fredholm with index \u2212n for all x.\n\n3.2.3\n\nThe adjoint of \u2206(x)\n\nGiven the Nahm operator \u2206(x) : W \u2192 V , the 'Hilbert space' adjoint \u2206\u2217 (x) : V \u2192 W\n\nis difficult to compute, involving the Sobolev space inner product on L21 . Instead\nit is easy to consider the adjoint as a map into the dual space of W , where linear\nfunctionals consist of pairing the L21 sections in W with sections in L2\u22121 , because this\ncan be computed by parts integration like that at the start of Section 3.2.2. Formally,\ntherefore, the adjoint is the map \u2206\u2217 (x) : V \u2192 W \u2217 , where W \u2217 is the dual space of W ,\ndefined by\n\nhv, \u2206(x)wi = h\u2206\u2217 (x)v, widual\nfor all v \u2208 V and w \u2208 W . The bracket h, idual denotes the evaluation of an element in\nW \u2217 on an element of W while the bracket on the LHS is just the inner product in V .\n\nIt is useful to understand W \u2217 as a sum of Sobolev spaces on the intervals Ip . First\nwe claim that\n(L\u030421 [a, b])\u2217 = L\u03072\u22121 [a, b] = L\u03042\u22121 [a, b] \u2295 {Span \u03b4a } \u2295 {Span \u03b4b }\n\n(3.27)\n\nwhere \u03b4a , \u03b4b are the evaluation functionals at a and b, which are certainly contained\nin L\u03072\u22121 [a, b]. The first equality is true from the definitions of L\u03042l and L\u03072l on page 52.\nConsider the orthogonal complement U of {Span \u03b4a } \u2295 {Span \u03b4b } in L\u03072\u22121 [a, b], and\nfix some element f \u2208 U . Then the map taking f (as an element of L2\u22121 (R)) to its\nequivalence class in L\u03042\u22121 [a, b] is an isomorphism U \u223c\n= L\u03042\u22121 [a, b], establishing (3.27). It\nfollows that\n\u0001\u2217\n\n\u0001\u2217\n\u0001\n\u0001\u2217\n= Wp\u22121 \u2295 Yp (\u03bcp ) \u2295 Yp (\u03bcp+1 ) .\nL 1\nRecall the definition (3.13) of W .

Now, since W is the subset of\n\nL\n\nWp1\n\nconsisting of sections with vanishing terminating component which are also continuous\nacross the \u03bcp , we obtain\n\u2217\n\nW =\n\nn\n\u0002M\n\nWp\u22121\n\np=1\n\n\u0003\n\n\u2295\n\nn\n\u0002M\np=1\n\n\u0001\u2217 \u0003\nYpcont (\u03bcp ) ,\n\nwhere Ypcont (\u03bcp ) is the space of continuing vectors at \u03bcp .\nWe can now compute \u2206\u2217 (x) in terms of this decomposition, i.e. as an operator\nV =\n\nn\n\u0002M\np=1\n\nn\nn\n\u0003 \u0002\n\u0003\n\u0002M\n\u0003 \u0002M\n\u0001\u2217 \u0003\nWp0 \u2295 CNzero \u2192\nWp\u22121 \u2295\nYpcont (\u03bcp )\n= W \u2217.\np=1\n\np=1\n\nIf we restrict \u2206\u2217 (x) to some domain A \u2282 V consisting of elements v \u2208 V with vp smooth\n\non the interior of Ip and continuous up to the ends of the interval, then A contains the\ncokernel, and integration by parts like that at the start of Section 3.2.2 gives\n\u2206\u2217 (x)v = (D1\u2217 (x)v1 , . . . , Dn\u2217 (x)vn ) \u2295\n\n\u0002M\n\n\u2295\n\np\u2208J\n/\n\n\u0001\u2217 \u0003\ncont\nivp\u22121\n(\u03bcp ) \u2212 ivpcont (\u03bcp )\n\n\u0002M\np\u2208J\n\ncont\nivp\u22121\n(\u03bcp ) \u2212 ivpcont (\u03bcp ) + sp \u03b6p\n\n\u0001\u2217 \u0003\n\n(3.28)\n\nwhere y \u2217 denotes the dual of a vector y \u2208 Ypcont (\u03bcp ), and v is given by (3.17). We will\n\nneed this expansion in Section 3.2.4.\n\nFinally, we make a few remarks about the projection P = Px onto coker \u2206(x).\nSince \u2206(x) is Fredholm, it follows that its image is closed, so the projection P exists\nand coker \u2206(x) = ker \u2206\u2217 (x). In addition, \u2206(x) is injective, so \u2206\u2217 (x) is surjective, and\n\u2206\u2217 (x)\u2206(x) is invertible. The projection P is given by\n\u0001\u22121 \u2217\n\u2206 (x).\nP = 1 \u2212 \u2206(x) \u2206\u2217 (x)\u2206(x)\n\n3.2.4\n\nNahm's equation and anti-self-duality\n\nWe want to show that when the Nahm data satisfies Nahm's equation, Coker \u2206(x) is\nanti-self-dual. The index calculation shows that the connection A defined by Coker \u2206(x)\nis a well-defined U (n) connection on R4 . Mimicking Proposition 1.22, the curvature is\ngiven by\nFA = P dx(\u2206\u2217 (x)\u2206(x))\u22121 dx\u2217 P,\n\n(3.29)\n\nso anti-self-duality follows if \u2206\u2217 (x)\u2206(x) commutes with the \u03b3j matrices. In equation (3.29) the domain of (\u2206\u2217 (x)\u2206(x))\u22121 is restricted to the image of dx\u2217 P . Using the\nconditions for sections to be in the cokernel of \u2206(x) given at the start of Section 3.2.2,\nit follows that (\u2206\u2217 (x)\u2206(x))\u22121 is only passed elements\n\u2217\n\nu = (u1 , . . . , un ) \u2295 (y1 , . . . , yn ) \u2208 W =\n64\n\nn\n\u0002M\np=1\n\nWp\u22121\n\n\u0003\n\n\u2295\n\nn\n\u0002M\np=1\n\n\u0001\u2217 \u0003\nYpcont (\u03bcp )\n\n\fthat have up smooth on the interior of Ip for all p and such that the continuing components of up are continuous up to the ends of the interval. Let A be the inverse image of\nthis subspace of W \u2217 . Since (\u2206\u2217 (x)\u2206(x))\u22121 is smoothing, sections in A are even 'nicer',\nand on the domain \u2206(x)A, \u2206\u2217 (x) is given by (3.28). It is therefore sufficient to prove\nthat \u2206\u2217 (x)\u2206(x) commutes with the \u03b3j matrices on the domain A, for which we take\n\u2206\u2217 (x) to be given by (3.28).\nFix w = (w1 , . . . , wn ) \u2208 A \u2282 W . Then\n\u2206\u2217 (x)\u2206(x)w = (D1\u2217 (x)D1 (x)w1 , . . . , Dn\u2217 (x)Dn (x)wn )\n\u0001\u2217 \u0003\n\u0002M\ncont\n(\u03bcp ) \u2212 ivpcont (\u03bcp )\nivp\u22121\n\u2295\np\u2208J\n/\n\n\u2295\n\n\u0002M\np\u2208J\n\ncont\nivp\u22121\n(\u03bcp ) \u2212 ivpcont (\u03bcp ) + sp \u03b6p\n\n\u0001\u2217 \u0003\n\n(3.30)\n\nusing equation (3.28), where vp = Dp (x)wp and sp = \u03c0p wp (\u03bcp ). Expanding Dp\u2217 (x)Dp (x)\non each interval gives\nDp\u2217 (x)Dp (x) = \u2207\u2217p \u2207p +\n\nX\nj\n\n[x2j +2ixj Tpj \u2212(Tpj )2 ]\u2212\n\nX\ni,j,k\n\n[\u03b3i \u2297\u2207p Tpi +\u01ebijk \u03b3i \u2297Tpj Tpk ]. (3.31)\n\nThe Tpj satisfy Nahm's equation (3.1) on the interior of each interval Ip , so the term\ninvolving the \u03b3j matrices vanishes there. It remains to consider the components in\nYpcont (\u03bcp ). First consider a point \u03be = \u03bcp with kp 6= 0. At such a point the continuing\n\ncomponents of Tp and wp are continuous, so\n\nd\nd cont\nwp\u22121 (\u03bcp ) + wpcont (\u03bcp ).\n(3.32)\nd\u03be\nd\u03be\n(The RHS exists since w \u2208 A.) If we replace w with \u03b3j w, the RHS of equation (3.32) is\ncont\nivp\u22121\n(\u03bcp ) \u2212 ivpcont (\u03bcp ) = \u2212\n\nmultiplied by \u03b3j , so this component of (\u2206\u2217 (x)\u2206(x))\u22121 commutes with the \u03b3j matrices.\nAt a zero jump the continuing component of Tp is discontinuous, and\ncont\nivp\u22121\n(\u03bcp ) \u2212 ivpcont (\u03bcp ) = \u2212\n\nd\nd\nwp\u22121 (\u03bcp ) + wp (\u03bcp )\nd\u03be\nd\u03be\n\u2212 Tp\u22121 (\u03bcp )wp (\u03bcp ) + Tp (\u03bcp )wp (\u03bcp ). (3.33)\n\nThe first two terms on the RHS commute with the \u03b3j matrices, just as for the kp 6= 0\n\ncase. However,\n\n\u0001\nTp (\u03bcp ) \u2212 Tp\u22121 (\u03bcp ) wp (\u03bcp ) = \u2212\u03b6p \u00d7 \u03c0p wp (\u03bcp ) = \u2212sp \u03b6p\n\nand these terms cancel with the contribution from the sp in (3.30). Substituting (3.32)\nand (3.33) into (3.30) gives\n\u2206\u2217 (x)\u2206(x)w = (D1\u2217 (x)D1 (x)w1 , . . . , Dn\u2217 (x)Dn (x)wn )\nn\n\u0001\u2217 \u0003\n\u0002M\nd cont\nd cont\nwp (\u03bcp ) \u2212 wp\u22121\n(\u03bcp )\n\u2295\nd\u03be\nd\u03be\np=1\n\nand this map commutes with the \u03b3j matrices. It follows that Coker \u2206 is ASD.\n65\n\n\f3.2.5\n\nPeriodicity\n\nBefore considering how to frame (E, A) = Coker \u2206, it is useful to make some remarks\nabout periodicity. In particular we will fix some notation required later, and explain\n1\nhow to quotient (E, A) to obtain a connection on S2\u03c0/\u03bc\n\u00d7 R3 . As it stands, Coker \u2206 is\n0\n\na bundle and connection over R4 . Under translation in x0 , \u2206 satisfies\n\u22121\n\u2206(\u03c4 x) = U\u03c4,V \u2206(x)U\u03c4,W\n\n(3.34)\n\n\u03c4 : (x0 , x1 , x2 , x3 ) 7\u2192 (x0 + \u03b4\u03c4 , x1 , x2 , x3 )\n\n(3.35)\n\nwhere \u03c4 is the translation\n\nand U\u03c4,W , U\u03c4,V are unitary maps, given by\nU\u03c4,W (w) = (exp i\u03b4\u03c4 \u03be)w,\nU\u03c4,V ((vp ) \u2295 (sq )) = ((exp i\u03b4\u03c4 \u03be)vp ) \u2295 ((exp i\u03b4\u03c4 \u03bcq )sq ).\nThese maps are not well-defined for all \u03b4\u03c4 : in general U\u03c4,W (w) will not be periodic in\n\u03be, so will fail to be an element of W . When \u03b4\u03c4 is a multiple of 2\u03c0/\u03bc0 , however, the\nmaps are well-defined, so fix \u03b4\u03c4 = 2\u03c0/\u03bc0\n\n1\n\nand the corresponding maps U\u03c4,W , U\u03c4,V . Of\n\ncourse, U\u03c4,W , U\u03c4,V correspond to the gauge transformation (1.17) for the transform on\nthe 4-torus. We will often just write U\u03c4 for U\u03c4,V , so that\n\nNow\n\n\u0001\nU\u03c4 (vp ) \u2295 (sq ) = ((exp 2\u03c0i\u03be/\u03bc0 )vp ) \u2295 ((exp 2\u03c0i\u03bcq /\u03bc0 )sq ).\n\n(3.36)\n\ncoker \u2206(\u03c4 x) = U\u03c4 coker \u2206(x)\nso U\u03c4 defines an action of Z on E. It is easy to check that\nA(\u03c4 x) = (U\u03c4\u22121 )\u2217 A(x)\n\n(3.37)\n\nso the connection is compatible with this action. Quotienting by this action gives an\n1\nhermitian bundle on S2\u03c0/\u03bc\n\u00d7 R3 with a compatible connection.\n0\n\nNote that U\u03c4,W and U\u03c4,V are not determined uniquely: we can replace them with\n\n(exp i\u03bb)U\u03c4,W and (exp i\u03bb)U\u03c4,V for any \u03bb \u2208 R and (3.34) still holds. However, the\nchoice (3.36) is the only choice that allows the caloron to be framed in the correct way.\n1\n\nWe can use U (n) Nahm data to construct a caloron with m times the expected period for m =\n1, 2, 3, . . . by taking \u03b4\u03c4 to be m \u00d7 2\u03c0/\u03bc0 . The point is, however, that while other periods are possible,\nthe Nahm data does give rise to a caloron of the anticipated period. Changing the periodicity of the\ncaloron in this way maps \u03bc0 7\u2192 \u03bc0 /m and k0 7\u2192 mk0 because in the quasi-periodic picture the clutching\nfunction is composed with itself m times. This should correspond to some map between sets of U (n)\nNahm data. Similarly, given a set of U (n) Nahm data, we can simply glue together m copies of it to\nobtain a set of U (nm) Nahm data with period m\u03bc0 . This should correspond to some map between\ncaloron configurations, probably embedding the U (n) caloron m times in U (nm).\n\n66\n\n\f3.2.6\n\nRemarks on the rotation map\n\nThe definition of the Nahm data for a caloron implicitly involves a choice of origin\nfor the circle S\u03bc10 . Suppose \u2206(x) : W \u2192 V is the Nahm operator constructed from\nsome element of N (B) for some set of boundary data B. The inner product on V is\nindependent of the choice of origin on S\u03bc10 , and so, as a bundle and connection over\n\nR4 , Coker \u2206 is also independent of this choice. Recall the rotation map \u03c1\u2202 defined\nby (2.33). Rotation of the Nahm data by \u03bc0 /n defines a map\n\u03c1N : N (B) \u2192 N (\u03c1\u2202 B)\n\n(3.38)\n\nbut, as it stands, Coker \u2206 is insensitive to this action. However, the way we frame\nCoker \u2206 does depend on the choice of origin: if the Nahm data has boundary data B\nthen we want the corresponding caloron to have boundary data B too.\nIn fact, we only give a construction of calorons from Nahm data with principal\nboundary data-for technical reasons the construction is much harder if the data is\nnot principal, essentially because we can only recover k0 when it is the smallest rank\nof the bundles X1 , . . . , Xn . Given a set of Nahm data with boundary data B (not\nnecessarily principal), we can rotate it until its boundary data B \u2032 is principal. Our\nconstruction will then give a framed caloron with boundary data B \u2032 , but by applying\nthe rotation map \u03c1C defined in Section 2.2 to the caloron, we can transform it into a\ncaloron with boundary data B as desired. This method of defining the construction\nwhen B is non-principal ensures the following diagram commutes:\nN (B)\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\u03c1N y\n\nNahm\n\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\nconstruction\n\nNahm\n\nC(B)\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\u03c1\ny C\n\nN (\u03c1\u2202 B) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 C(\u03c1\u2202 B)\nconstruction\n\nThe diagram commutes by definition when there is only one principal rotation of the\nNahm data. If there is more than one principal rotation, then without loss of generality\nwe can assume B and \u03c1\u2202 B are both principal (by replacing the rotation maps \u03c1\u2202 , \u03c1C , \u03c1N\nwith \u03c1k\u2202 , \u03c1kC , \u03c1kN for some k) The two calorons on the RHS of the diagram must be\nequivalent as quasi-periodic connections over R4 -in other words they are related by a\nlarge gauge transformation-since Coker \u2206 is insensitive to the action of \u03c1N . It is easy\nto see the large gauge transformation must be \u03c1C .\n\n3.3\n3.3.1\n\n \u0303\nThe model operator \u2206\nStrategy\n\nThe aim of the remainder of this Chapter is to show that the bundle and connection\n2 , and is framed there. This will complete the proof that the Nahm\nCoker \u2206 extends to S\u221e\n\n67\n\n\fconstruction on an element of N \u2217 (k0 , ~k, \u03bc0 , ~\u03bc) produces an element of C \u2217 (k0 , ~k, \u03bc0 , ~\u03bc).\n \u0303 of \u2206, and prove that Coker \u2206\n \u0303\nThe method adopted is to consider a deformation \u2206\n2 and is a framed bundle (\u1ebc, f ) with invariant c (\u1ebc, f ) = k . We then\nextends to S\u221e\n2\n0\n\nprove that the framing and the invariant c2 are independent of the deformation, and so\ndeduce that Coker \u2206 \u2208 C \u2217 (k0 , ~k, \u03bc0 , ~\u03bc). The first task is to define the model operator\n\n \u0303 and prove that it is injective and Fredholm with index \u2212n, which forms Section 3.3.\n\u2206\n \u0303 is a framed caloron configuration, and in SecIn Section 3.4 we prove that Coker \u2206\n \u0303 is an element of C(k0 , ~k, \u03bc0 , ~\u03bc).\ntion 3.5 calculate c2 (\u1ebc, f ). This shows that Coker \u2206\n\n \u0303 can be deformed into \u2206 in such a way that the\nFinally, in Section 3.6, we prove that \u2206\n\nframing is independent of the deformation, and deduce that Coker \u2206 is an element of\nC \u2217 (k0 , ~k, \u03bc0 , ~\n\u03bc). This method is based on Hitchin's proof that a connection and Higgs\n\nfield constructed from monopole Nahm data satisfy the monopole boundary conditions\n[17, Section 2].\nFrom this point on fix the following notation. Fix a set of U (n) caloron Nahm data\nwith principal boundary data (k0 , ~k, \u03bc0 , \u03bc\n~ ). If the boundary data is not principal then\nwe apply the rotation map \u03c1N to the Nahm data to obtain a set of principal Nahm\ndata; we then apply the corresponding rotation map \u03c1\u22121\nC to the caloron constructed to\nobtain the correct framing, just as we explained in Section 3.2.6. Let A\u221e , \u03a6\u221e be the\nconnection and Higgs field at infinity determined by (~k, \u03bc\n~ ).

The problems encountered when defining\n \u0303 are therefore to ensure Coker \u2206\n \u0303 is framed and that c2 (\u1ebc, f ) = k0 . Much of the\n\u2206\n'engineering' we do is to make the proof that c2 (\u1ebc, f ) = k0 straightforward. Note that\n \u0303 is a deformation\nthroughout this Section we make no claims that the model operator \u2206\n \u0303 will be defined in terms of a deformation, but we delay the proof of the\nof \u2206; often \u2206\nexistence of a path joining the two until later.\n \u0303 it is easiest to consider two special cases\nWhen defining the model operator \u2206\nfirst. The first is the case of vanishing monopole charges-the case that kp = 0 for all\np = 1, . . . , n but k0 6= 0. (Calorons of this type were introduced in Section 1.2.2.) The\n\nsecond case is the opposite of this: the case that there are no zero jumps in the lowest\n\nrank block (we will make this precise later). We call this the case of 'no zero jumps in\nthe instanton block'. In the remaining cases, the model operator is very similar to that\nfor no zero jumps in the instanton block, so the reader may prefer to concentrate on\nthat case.\n\n68\n\n\f3.3.2\n\n \u0303 the case of vanishing monopole charges\nDefining \u2206:\n\nSuppose that kp = 0 for all p = 1, . . . , n but k0 6= 0 i.e. that every singularity \u03bcp in\nthe Nahm data is a zero jump.

Corollary 3.26\nNote that \u2206\n \u0303\ntherefore implies that \u2206(x)\nis Fredholm with index \u2212n for all x. As a final remark,\n \u0303 is continuous across the zero jumps: the discontinuity in \u2206 is\nnote that, unlike \u2206, \u2206\nrequired to ensure Coker \u2206 is anti-self-dual, but it is not required to ensure Coker \u2206 is\nframed.\n\n3.3.3\n\n \u0303 the case of no zero jumps in the instanton block\nDefining \u2206:\n\nMoving on to the second special case, we first explain what is meant by 'no zero jumps\nin the instanton block'. A zero jump in the instanton block is a point \u03be = \u03bcp for\nwhich mp = min{m1 , . . . , mn } which is also a zero jump (i.e. kp = 0). The condition\n\nof no zero jumps in the instanton block is the opposite of the condition of vanishing\nmonopole charges, for which every singularity was a zero jump in the instanton block.\n70\n\n\fFigure 3.1 illustrates the situation, plotting the rank of the Nahm data versus \u03be for\nthree examples.\nWe assume, therefore, that the Nahm data has no zero jumps in the instanton block.\nWe can split off a bundle over S\u03bc10 of constant rank, and thereby decompose each bundle\nYp into two sub-bundles, in the following way. Recall that we are assuming that the\nNahm data is principal so that\nk0 = min{rank Xp : p = 1, . . . , n}.\nThere exists a set {\u03b7\u03041 , . . . , \u03b7\u0304k0 } of sections of the bundles X1 , . . . , Xn that are defined\nover all of S\u03bc10 , that are periodic, smooth on each interval Ip \u2282 S\u03bc10 , continuous across\neach singularity \u03be = \u03bcp , orthogonal for each \u03be \u2208 R, normalised with respect to the L2\n\ninner product, and linearly independent. In other words, we can find a k0 -dimensional\nsub-bundle XpI of each Xp such that the XpI glue together to give a continuous bundle\nover S\u03bc10 . Note that this decomposition is not unique: if rank Xp > k0 then there is\nsome choice for the \u03b7\u0304l over Ip . Define \u03b7l and \u03b7l\u22a5 by (3.39). We can choose the \u03b7\u0304l so\nthat for all l = 1, . . . , k0 and q \u2208 J\n\u03c0q \u03b7l = 0 = \u03c0q \u03b7l\u22a5 .\n\n(3.46)\n\nThis is possible because each zero jump occurs in a block with rank greater than k0 .\nThus we have a decomposition of each block Yp of Nahm data into a subspace YpI\nspanned by {\u03b7l (\u03be), \u03b7l\u22a5 (\u03be) : l = 1, . . . , k0 , \u03be \u2208 Ip } and the orthogonal complement YpM :\nYp = YpI \u2295 YpM .\nThe bundle formed by gluing together the YpI is called the instanton block , and its\northogonal complement is called the monopole block .

Define\n\u2206I (x) : WI \u2192 VI\nd\n\u2206I (x) = i + i(1 \u2297 \u039b) + x\nd\u03be\n\n(3.48)\n(3.49)\n\nwhere \u039b = diag(i\u03bb1 , . . . , i\u03bbk0 ) for some pairwise distinct \u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbk0 \u2208 (0, 2\u03c0/\u03bc0 ). Just\nas we saw for the case of vanishing monopole charges, \u2206I (x) is injective, apart from at\n\nthe resonating points defined by (3.40).\nRestriction of the caloron Nahm data to the monopole block determines a set of\nU (n) monopole data, i.e. an element of NMon (~k, ~\u03bc), and the associated Nahm operator\n\n\u2206M (x) : WM \u2192 VM . (Note that this data does not necessarily satisfy Nahm's equation.) At a singularity \u03be = \u03bcp with kp 6= 0 the Nahm data determines a |kp |-dimensional\n\nresidue Rp . We deform \u2206M (x) so that near such singularities it is given by\ni\n\nd\niRp\n+\n+x\nd\u03be \u03be \u2212 \u03bcp\n\non the terminating component and\ni\n\nd\n+x\nd\u03be\n\n(3.50)\n\n \u0303\non the continuing component. Near zero jumps we deform so that \u2206(x)\nis also given\nby (3.50).

Note\nthat without condition (3.46), \u2206M would not be a well-defined U (n) monopole Nahm\noperator, since \u03c0 would be non-zero on the instanton block. Lemma 3.10 implies that\n\u2206M (x) : WM \u2192 VM defined in this way is injective and Fredholm with index \u2212n for\nall x.\n\nConsider the operator\n\u0012\n\n\u2206I (x)\n0\n0\n\u2206M (x)\n\n\u0013\n\n: W \u2192 V.\n\nIt is injective away from the resonating points (3.40). We want to put something into\nthe off-diagonal entries, supported near the resonating points, that will ensure the new\noperator is injective everywhere. We need the following:\nLemma 3.52. Let \u2206M be the Nahm operator for some set of U (n) (n \u2265 2) Nahm data\nin NMon (~k, ~\n\u03bc), and let x \u2208 R4 . Then we can find two non-trivial orthogonal continuous\n73\n\n\fsections u, u\u22a5 of the bundle Coker \u2206M defined on some open neighbourhood R of x,\nsuch that, for all y \u2208 R, u(y) and u\u22a5 (y) are continuous across each zero jump so have\nzero component in CNzero .\n\nProof: For any set of U (n) monopole Nahm data the singularities \u03bc1 and \u03bcn cannot\nbe zero jumps, so there are at most n \u2212 2 zero jumps in the data. The restriction\n\nthat solutions be continuous across the zero jumps therefore rules out at most n \u2212 2\n\ndimensions, and so u(y) and u\u22a5 (y) can be chosen from a 2-dimensional subspace of\n\ncoker \u2206M (y). Moreover, this can be done smoothly on some neighbourhood R of x. \u2737\nLet \u03c6lm be a set of bump functions on R \u00d7 R3 that are equal to 1 on some 4-ball\n\nres\nwith centre x = xres\nlm and zero outside some 4-ball with centre x = xlm .

Let k = kp , and\nlet t = \u03be \u2212 \u03bcp .\n\nThe case k > 0: We continue the representation theory started in Section 3.2.2.\nP\nFix a unit vector x\u0302 \u2208 R3 , and let u = 31 xj \u03b3j . Then u generates a circle in SU (2) and\ndecomposes S k\u22121 \u2297 S 1 \u223c\n= S k \u2295 S k\u22122 into weight spaces with weight k, k \u2212 2, . . . , \u2212(k \u2212\n\n2), \u2212k for S k and k \u2212 2, k \u2212 4, . . . , \u2212(k \u2212 4), \u2212(k \u2212 2) for S k\u22122 . Recall that S k is\n\nthe representation of su(2) on homogeneous polynomials of degree k. If [\u03be0 : \u03be1 ] are\nhomogeneous coordinates on CP1 = S 2 , it is easy to check that the polynomial\n(\u03be0 z0 + \u03be1 z1 )k\n\n(3.66)\n\nis the highest weight vector when u = [\u03be0 : \u03be1 ]. The action of 1 \u2297 u commutes with the\n\naction of u \u2297 u so 1 \u2297 u preserves the weight spaces with weights \u00b1k since they occur\nwith multiplicity one. Let v+ , v\u2212 be elements of S k with unit norm and weights +k, \u2212k\n\nrespectively. Now (1 \u2297 u)2 = \u22121, so (1 \u2297 u)v+ = \u00b1iv+ and (1 \u2297 u)v\u2212 = \u00b1iv\u2212 . In fact\n\nusing the explicit form (3.66) of the highest weight vector, we have (1 \u2297 u)v+ = iv+\n\nand (1 \u2297 u)v\u2212 = \u2212iv\u2212 . As u varies, v+ \u2208 S k spans out a line bundle L over S 2 , and\nusing (3.66) it follows that L has Chern class k. The action of SO(3) on the direction\n\nvector x\u0302 lifts to the adjoint action of SU (2) on u \u2208 su(2). Hence, on a neighbourhood\n\nof x\u0302 \u2208 R3 , we can choose the highest weight vector v+ according to\nv+ (gx\u0302) = gv+ (x\u0302)\nwhere g \u2208 SO(3) acts by some unitary endomorphism on S k .\n\n \u0303 \u2217 (x).

From (3.19)\nwe have that Rp v+ = 12 (k \u2212 1)v+ and (1 \u2297 u)v+ = iv+ , so a solution is given on some\ninterval t \u2208 [\u22122\u03b4, 0] by\n\n\u0002\n\u0001\u0003\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0169p = t(k\u22121)/2 exp ix0 (t + \u03bcp ) exp(rt) v+ .\n\n(3.67)\n\nNote that (t + \u03bcp ) in the expression above could be replaced by (t + a) for any a and\n\u0169p would still be a solution. We chose \u0169p as above so that the result of translating by\none period \u03c4 is given by the action of U\u03c4 (where U\u03c4 is defined by (3.36)). This will\n79\n\n\fensure that the quasi-periodic connection we eventually obtain has a clutch map that\nis the identity on the boundary. Also note that we could have used v\u2212 to construct a\nsolution. However, such a solution would blow up in the limit t \u2192 0, and so fails to be\nL2 .\n\nWe want our approximate solutions to be smooth and have compact support, so\nwe multiply by a bump function \u03c6p (t) supported on t \u2208 [\u22122\u03b4, 0] that takes value 1 on\n\n[\u2212\u03b4, 0]. We also want the approximate solutions to have unit norm, so define \u1e7dp , the\napproximate solution associated to \u03bcp , to be\n\u1e7dp = Cp\u22121 \u03c6p \u0169p\n\n(3.68)\n\nwhere Cp = k\u03c6p \u0169p kL2 .

Fix a direction vector\nx\u0302 \u2208 R3 . Each approximate solution \u1e7dp is associated to a vector ep that spans out a line\n\n2 .

By construction, there is a unitary action of SO(3) on the\nep such that\nep (gx\u0302) = gep (x\u0302) where g \u2208 SO(3).\n\n(3.84)\n\nTo prove the Proposition it is sufficient to show that in the local trivialisation\nw\u03031 , . . . , w\u0303n of \u1ebc, the matrices \u00c3\u03c7 , \u00c3x0 , \u00c3y1 , \u00c3y2 representing \u00c3 extend smoothly to the\n2 and are appropriately framed there. In particular, we claim that\nboundary I\u01eb \u00d7 S\u221e\n2 ,\n\u2022 \u00c3\u03c7 = 0 on I\u01eb \u00d7 S\u221e\n2 ,\n\u2022 \u00c3x0 = diag(i\u03bc1 , . . . , i\u03bcn ) on I\u01eb \u00d7 S\u221e\n2 for j = 1, 2.\n\u2022 \u00c3yj = diag(h\u2202yj ep , ep i) on I\u01eb \u00d7 S\u221e\n\nThese conditions are sufficient to deduce that \u00c3 is the interior restriction of some\nconnection Aq framed by A\u221e , \u03a6\u221e . In addition, we also have to verify that there is\nsome clutching map\nc(s) : \u1ebc|x0 =s \u2192 \u1ebc|x0 =s+2\u03c0/\u03bc0\n84\n\n\fsuch that\n\u0001\u2217\n\u00c3(x0 = s + 2\u03c0/\u03bc0 ) = c(s)\u22121 \u00c3(x0 = s)\n\nand that in the gauge w\u03031 , . . . , w\u0303n , c \u2192 1 as r \u2192 \u221e. It follows that \u00c3 is the interior\n\nrestriction of a quasi-periodic connection Aq framed by A\u221e , \u03a6\u221e .\n\nTo prove the claim about the framing we have to calculate the matrices \u00c3\u03c7 , \u00c3x0 ,\n\u00c3y1 , and \u00c3y2 using a formula like (3.6):\n(\u00c3a )ij = h\u2202a w\u0303i , w\u0303j i.\nSince w\u0303j = \u1e7dj + exponentially decaying term, we have that\n(\u00c3a )ij = h\u2202a \u1e7di , \u1e7dj i + (smooth exponentially decaying term in \u03c7).\nHence it is sufficient to consider the matrices h\u2202a \u1e7di , \u1e7dj i for a = \u03c7, x0 , y1 , y2 . By mak-\n\ning the supports of the bump functions \u03c6p used to define the approximate solutions\n\nsufficiently small, these matrices are diagonal, and since the approximate solutions are\northonormal, the diagonal entries in the matrices must be imaginary. Fix some p and\nconsider the p'th diagonal element of each matrix. Let k = kp and t = \u03be \u2212 \u03bcp .\n\nFirst consider \u00c3\u03c7 . When k > 0, \u1e7dp is defined by (3.68), and \u2202\u03c7 \u1e7dp is given by\n\u2202\u03c7 \u1e7dp = \u2212\n\n\u0010 t\n\u2202\u03c7 Cp \u0011\n\u1e7dp .\n+\n\u03c72\nCp\n\nThus (\u00c3\u03c7 )pp = h\u2202\u03c7 \u1e7dp , \u1e7dp iL2 is a real integral, and so must vanish since it is also imaginary. Hence h\u2202\u03c7 w\u0303p , w\u0303p iL2 is smooth up to the boundary and vanishes there. The cases\nk = 0 and k < 0 are entirely similar.\n\nNext consider \u00c3x0 = diag(h\u2202x0 w\u0303p , w\u0303p i). We want to show that h\u2202x0 \u1e7dp , \u1e7dp i is smooth\n\nup to the boundary and has value i\u03bcp when \u03c7 = 0. The proof depends on whether\nk > 0, k = 0, or k < 0; start by assuming k > 0 so that \u1e7dp is given by (3.67) and (3.68).\nThen \u2202x0 \u1e7dp = i(t + \u03bcp )\u1e7dp so\nh\u2202x0 \u1e7dp , \u1e7dp i = hi(t + \u03bcp )\u1e7dp , \u1e7dp iL2 = i\u03bcp + iht\u1e7dp , \u1e7dp iL2 .\nThis last term is independent of x0 , and because of the SO(3) invariance (3.84), independent of y1 , y2 ; we want to show it is a smooth function of \u03c7 and tends to zero as\n\u03c7 \u2192 0. Now\n\nht\u1e7dp , \u1e7dp iL2 = Ik /|Ik\u22121 |\n\nwhere Ik is defined by (3.69). So (3.72) implies that\nht\u1e7dp , \u1e7dp iL2 = C\u03c7 + smooth exponentially decreasing term,\nwhich completes the case k > 0. The cases k = 0 and k < 0 are dealt with via very\nsimilar estimates.\n85\n\n\fFinally, consider \u00c3yj for j = 1, 2. Fix j and let y = yj . It is sufficient to show that\n2 . As usual, we have to deal case-by-case with the sign\nh\u2202y \u1e7dp , \u1e7dp iL2 = h\u2202y ep , ep i on S\u221e\n\nof k. When k > 0 or k < 0 this can be seen immediately from the definition of \u1e7dp . For\nexample, when k > 0:\nh\u2202y \u1e7dp , \u1e7dp iL2\n\n1\n=\nk\u03c6p \u0169p k2L2\n\nZ\n\nIp\n\n[\u03c62p tkp \u22121 exp\n\n2t\n]h\u2202y ep , ep i dt = h\u2202y ep , ep i.\n\u03c7\n\nFor kp = 0 and assuming the zero jump is in the monopole block, we have\n\u0003\n\u0002\n+ 2\n2\nh\u2202y \u1e7dp , \u1e7dp iL2 = Cp\u22121 k\u03c6p \u0169\u2212\np kL2 h\u2202y (\u03c0+ ep ), \u03c0+ ep i + k\u03c6p \u0169p kL2 h\u2202y (\u03c0\u2212 ep ), \u03c0\u2212 ep i .\n\n+ +\n\u2212\nBut integral estimates show k\u03c6\u2212\np \u0169p kL2 = O(\u03c7) = k\u03c6p \u0169p kL2 as \u03c7 \u2192 0.\n\nHence\n\nh\u2202y \u1e7dp , \u1e7dp iL2 = O(\u03c7) as \u03c7 \u2192 0. However, h\u2202y ep , ep i = 0 since k = 0, and so h\u2202y \u1e7dp , \u1e7dp iL2\n\nextends smoothly to \u2202X where it equals h\u2202y ep , ep i. When the zero jump is in the in-\n\nstanton block the exact solution defined by (3.79) and (3.80) gives exactly the same\nresult. This completes the proof of the claim about the framing.\nIt remains to prove that \u00c3 clutches correctly.

There are no such solutions away from\nacross all the \u03bcp and be in the kernel of D\u039b\n\nthe resonating points.) Setting E0 = EM and A0 = AM we can then use the scheme\ndescribed at the start of Section 3.5: k0 is given by (3.87), and for each l = 1, . . . , k0\nwe want to find the transition function gl from EM |Supp\n\n\u03c6l\n\nto \u1ebc|Supp\n\n\u03c6l\n\nwhere \u03c6l = \u03c6l,0 ,\n\nand \u03c6lm are the bump functions used to define B.\n \u0303\nWe have to identify coker \u2206(x)\non Supp \u03c6l .

Equation (3.93) was constructed to ensure that the gauge was\n89\n\n\funitary on the boundary but well-defined on the interior of Supp \u03c6l . There is no obstruction to taking the unitarisation over Supp \u03c6l , without affecting the gauge near the\nboundary. Using (3.93) we can compare this trivialisation with the trivialisation (3.89),\nand see that the transition function gl from EM |Supp \u03c6l to \u1ebc|Supp\n!\nidn\u22122\n0\ngl =\n.\nx\u2217 \u2212\u03bbl\n0\nkx\u2217 \u2212\u03bbl k\n\n\u03c6l\n\nis\n(3.95)\n\nSubstituting this into (3.88) gives c2 (Fl ) = \u22121, since with our definition of deg g, the\nmap\n\ng : S 3 \u2282 R4 \u2192 U (2)\nx \u2217 \u2212 \u03bbl\ng(x) = \u2217\nkx \u2212 \u03bbl k\nhas degree \u22121. Thus, using (3.87), we have shown that k\u03030 = k0 .\n\n3.5.2\n\nThe case of vanishing monopole charges\n\nFollowing the scheme outlined at the start of Section 3.5, we want to identify the bundle\nand connection (E0 , A0 ). Since there is no monopole block, this is rather different to\nthe case of no zero jumps in the instanton block, where E0 was the cokernel of the\n \u0303\nrestriction of \u2206(x)\nto the monopole block. Essentially, we calculate the transition\nfunctions gl by taking a trivialisation consisting of the exact solutions v1 , . . . , vn away\nfrom the resonating points, while at the resonating point xres\nlm two of these solutions\n\u22a5 to give a local trivialisation. We take E to be the trivial\nare replaced by \u03b7lm , \u03b7lm\n0\n\nbundle Cn over I\u01eb \u00d7 R3 . Let {Blm : l = 1, . . . , k0 and m \u2208 Z} be a collection of closed\n\nballs round the resonating points xres\nl,m , on which conditions (3.43)\u2013(3.45) hold, and let\nSk0\nBl = Bl,0 . Let R = 1 Bl and let Rc denote the complement. The exact solutions\n\nv1 , . . . , vn defined in Section 3.4.2 determine a bundle isomorphism\nF : \u1ebc|Rc \u2192 E0 |Rc .\n\nAfter applying the Gram-Schmidt algorithm to v1 , . . . , vn we obtain a unitary bundle\nisomorphism FU in the same way. Define a connection A0 on E0 by\nA0 |Rc = (FU\u22121 )\u2217 \u00c3|Rc\nand continue A0 arbitrarily over R. It follows that A0 is the interior restriction of a\nframed quasi-periodic connection, and that (E0 , A0 ) extends to the boundary in the\nsame way as (\u1ebc, \u00c3). If f denotes the framing at infinity, then since (E0 , A0 ) has vanishing monopole charges, equation (2.32) implies that\nZ\nch2 (E0 , A0 ) = \u2212c2 (E0 , f ).\n[0,2\u03c0/\u03bc0 ]\u00d7R3\n\n90\n\n\fHowever, we claim that A0 has trivial clutching function, so that the RHS is zero. Now\nA0 = (FU\u22121 )\u2217 \u00c3 on Rc and \u00c3(\u03c4 x) = (U\u03c4\u22121 )\u2217 \u00c3(x) where \u03c4 is translation by 2\u03c0/\u03bc0 in x0 ,\nso\n\u0001\u2217\n\u0001\u2217\n\u0001\u2217\nA0 (\u03c4 x) = F \u22121 (\u03c4 x) U\u03c4\u22121 F (x) A0 (x)\n= [F (x)U\u03c4\u22121 F \u22121 (\u03c4 x)]\u2217 A0 (x).\n\nHowever, the exact solutions vp satisfy\nvp (\u03c4 x) = U\u03c4 vp (x)\n\n(3.96)\n\nF (x)U\u03c4\u22121 F \u22121 (\u03c4 x) \u2261 1.\n\n(3.97)\n\nso\n\nThe Gram-Schmidt process gives some GL(n, C) function \u0398(x) such that\nFU (x) = \u0398(x)F (x)\nand equation (3.96) implies that \u0398(\u03c4 x) = \u0398(x). Substituting this into (3.97) shows\nthat A0 has trivial clutching function, so we have proved our claim, and shown that\nZ\nch2 (E0 , A0 ) = 0.\n[0,2\u03c0/\u03bc0 ]\u00d7R3\n\nNext we want to find a trivialisation of \u1ebc|Bl for each l = 1, . . . , k0 . Comparing this\nwith the gauge v1 , . . . , vn on Rc will give the transition function gl on \u2202Bl between E0 |Bl\n\nand \u1ebc|Bl . Start by fixing some l \u2208 {1, . . . , k0 }. From the definition of the model operator\n\nin Section 3.3.2, there exist ql , ql\u22a5 \u2208 {1, . . . , n} satisfying conditions (3.43), (3.44),\nand (3.45). Condition (3.45) implies that for q \u2208\n/ {ql , ql\u22a5 } the solution vq is well-defined\n\n/ {ql , ql\u22a5 }}\neverywhere on Bl , since vq is just some vector in CNzero . The set {vq : q \u2208\n\ncan therefore be extended by two sections v\u0302ql , v\u0302q\u22a5 to give a trivialisation of \u1ebc over Bl .\nl\n\nConsider\n\nwhere x =\nand that\n\nP\n\n\u0012\n\nv\u0302ql\nv\u0302q\u22a5\nl\n\n\u0013\n\nx \u2217 \u2212 \u03bbl\n= \u2217\nkx \u2212 \u03bbl k\n\nvq l\nvq \u22a5\n\n\u0012\n\nl\n\n\u0013\n\n(3.98)\n\nxa \u03b3a .

The set (3.99) is therefore a trivialisation\n\nof \u1ebc over Bl .\nWe can now calculate the transition function gl . Comparing the trivialisation (3.99)\nwith the exact solutions {vp : p = 1, . . . , n}, we see that (up to some re-ordering)\n!\nidn\u22122\n0\n.\ngl =\nx\u2217 \u2212\u03bbl\n0\nkx\u2217 \u2212\u03bbl k\nThe two trivialisations v1 , . . . , vn and (3.99) are not unitary, but applying the Gram\nSchmidt process is equivalent to replacing gl with\n\u0398(x)gl (x)\u0398\u22121 (x) \u2208 U (n)\nwhere \u0398 : \u2202Bl \u2192 GL(n, C). This does not affect the degree. Comparing gl with the\n\ncalculation of k\u03030 in the case of vanishing monopole charges, we have deg gl = \u22121 and\n\nso c2 (Fl ) = \u22121. This completes the proof that k\u03030 = k0 for vanishing monopole charges.\n92\n\n\f3.5.3\n\nThe case 1 \u2264 NI < n\n\nThe calculation is very similar to that in Section 3.5.1. Recall the definition of the\nmodel operator in Section 3.3.4, the definition of the adjoint in Section 3.3.5, and the\ndefinition of the exact solutions vp , p \u2208 JI , given in Section 3.4.2. In Section 3.4.2 we\n \u0303 \u2217 (x) on the complement of Supp B,\nshowed that the vp are well-defined solutions to \u2206\nwhere B is the off-diagonal block of the model operator. In fact the vp are well-defined\non Supp B, and are just vectors in CNzero , because \u03b6\u0303p (x) = 0 on Supp B. It follows that\nB \u2217 (x)vp (x) = 0 for each p \u2208 JI , and since the vp solve \u2206\u2217I (x)vp = 0 everywhere they\n \u0303 \u2217 (x) for all x. The vp therefore define a rank NI sub-bundle EI of \u1ebc,\nare solutions of \u2206\nwhich is equipped with a connection AI given by projection from V onto EI . The proof\nof Proposition 3.83 shows that (EI , AI ) is the interior restriction of a framed U (NI )\nquasi-periodic connection with vanishing monopole charges and clutching function cI .\nThe vp give a global trivialisation of EI in which AI is framed. Since vp (\u03c4 x) = U\u03c4 vp (x),\nusing the definition of the clutching function in Proposition 3.83 we have cI \u2261 1, and so\nc2 (EI , f ) = 0 where f is the framing determined by the exact solutions vp . Moreover,\nsince the \u03b6p span trivial line bundles in E\u221e , using (2.31) we have\nZ\nch2 (EI , AI ) = 0.\n\n(3.105)\n\n[0,2\u03c0/\u03bc0 ]\u00d7R3\n\nNow \u2206M (x) is the Nahm operator of some U (n \u2212 NI ) monopole Nahm data. Let\n(EM , AM ) = Coker \u2206M . Then Lemma 3.11 implies that\nZ\nX\n1\nch2 (EM , AM ) = \u2212\n\u03bc0\n[0,2\u03c0/\u03bc0 ]\u00d7R3\n\n\u03bcp kp\n\np\u2208JO \u222aJM\n\n=\u2212\n\n1\n(\u03bc1 k1 + * * * + \u03bcn kn )\n\u03bc0\n\nsince kp = 0 for all p \u2208\n/ JO \u222a JM . We can then define (E0 , A0 ) = (EM \u2295 EI , AM \u2295 AI ).\n\nOn the complement of the region R = Supp B,\n\u0012 \u2217\n\u0013\n\u2206I (x)\n0\n\u2217\n \u0303\n\u2206 (x) =\n0\n\u2206\u2217M (x)\n\nso \u1ebc|Rc = EI \u2295 EM and \u00c3|Rc = AI \u2295 AM . Since ch(EI \u2295 EM , AI \u2295 AM ) = ch(EI , AI ) +\n\nch(EM , AM ), (E0 , A0 ) satisfies (3.86).\n\nIt remains only to specify gauges on E0 and \u1ebc near each resonating point and\ncalculate the degree of the transition function.

The\nNext we want to perturb this deformation so that it lies in Map(I\u01eb \u00d7 R3 , F\u2212n\n\ndeformation corresponds to a five (real) dimensional surface \u03a3 lying in F\u2212n which is\n\nthe image of a map [0, 1] \u00d7 I\u01eb \u00d7 R3 \u2192 F\u2212n . Note that F\u2212n is not a smooth manifold,\n\nbut is stratified, with the strata corresponding to the dimension of the kernel. Let\nU \u2282 F\u2212n denote the subset of operators that are not injective. If the codimension of\n\ni . To perturb \u03a3\nU is sufficiently large, then the surface \u03a3 can be deformed into F\u2212n\ni\ninto F\u2212n\nwe require one dimension orthogonal to \u03a3 and U at each point on \u03a3, i.e. we\n\nrequire the codimension of U to be at least six (real) dimensions. The codimension of\n\nU can be calculated in the following way. Fix \u03b1 \u2208 U . Since \u03b1 is not injective, it has\n\na non-trivial kernel which is finite dimensional, so suppose {w1 , . . . , wm } is a basis for\n\nthe kernel, where m \u2265 1. Since ind \u03b1 = \u2212n, coker \u03b1 is m + n dimensional, so fix a\n\nbasis {v1 , . . . , vm+n } for the cokernel. Note that m + n \u2265 3 because n \u2265 2.

The condition\nfor i = 1, 2, 3 define a tangent plane to U at \u03b1, contained in F\u2212n\n\nm + n \u2265 3 implies that the three paths are well defined. Hence the (real) codimension\n\ni .\nof U is at least six, and so the deformation can be shifted into F\u2212n\n\nA problem might arise: we do not want to perturb \u2206s when s = 0 or 1, because the\n \u0303 Similarly, the other components of \u2202\u03a3\nperturbed path would no longer join \u2206 to \u2206.\nmight be affected. First consider what happens for large r. We want the path \u2206s to\nconsist of framed deformations of \u2206, which is certainly true before we perturb \u03a3. For\nsufficiently large r\n\u2206s (x) = \u2206(x) + sA\nwhere A is a multiplicative operator independent of x. Equation (3.31) implies that\nk\u2206s (x)wk2L2 \u2265 Cr 2 kwk2L2\nfor large r and some constant C, because A is uniformly bounded. Hence for sufficiently\nlarge r\nk\u2206s (x)wk = 0\n\n\u21d2\n\nkwkL2 = 0\n95\n\n\u21d2\n\nkwkL21 = 0\n\n\fso \u2206s (x) is injective for sufficiently large r. Thus, combining the three boundary\ncomponents, we only have to perturb \u2206s (x) on some compact subset of R3 to move\ni . Finally consider \u2202I . If we perturb \u2206 into F i\n\u03a3 into F\u2212n\n\u01eb\ns\n\u2212n for x0 \u2208 (\u2212\u01eb, \u01eb) then\n\nthe periodicity rule (3.108) fixes the perturbation for x0 \u2208 (2\u03c0/\u03bc0 \u2212 \u01eb, 2\u03c0/\u03bc0 + \u01eb).\n\nThus we have some fixed perturbation of \u03a3 in some neighbourhood of the boundary of\n\n[0, 1] \u00d7 I\u01eb \u00d7 R3 , and we want to extend this to a perturbation of the whole of \u03a3. The\n\nProposition follows from the Lemma below.\n\n\u2737\n\nLemma 3.109. Suppose \u03a3 is the image of some map \u03c3 : M = [0, 1]\u00d7I\u01eb \u00d7R3 \u2192 F\u2212n and\n\nA is a neighbourhood of the boundary of M . We know that while M is 5-dimensional,\n\nthe complement of the space of non-injective Fredholm operators has codimension 6.\ni\ni .\nThen any deformation of \u03c3(A) into F\u2212n\nextends to a deformation of \u03a3 into F\u2212n\n\nProof: Milnor [29, Theorem 1.35] proves an equivalent result for smooth manifolds\nwhich extends to spaces of Fredholm operators readily.\n\n3.6.2\n\n\u2737\n\nRecovering the boundary conditions\n\n \u0303 of \u2206 together with bundles and connections\nWe have a deformation \u2206\n(E, A) = Coker \u2206\n\n \u0303\nand (\u1ebc, \u00c3) = Coker \u2206.\n\n2 in the sense of Proposition 3.83, our aim is to prove that\nGiven that \u00c3 extends to S\u221e\n2 and is framed there, by comparing the two connections and showing\nA extends to S\u221e\n\nthat A is asymptotically close to \u00c3. The precise statement is as follows:\nProposition 3.110. The bundle and connection (E, A) is the interior restriction of\n(Eq , Aq ) where Aq is some U (n) quasi-periodic connection which satisfies the smoothness\nconditions of Section 2.1.6 and which is framed by A\u221e , \u03a6\u221e .\nProof: The aim is to construct a unitary isomorphism F and framed quasi-periodic\nconnection Aq such that F : E \u2192 Eq |I\u01eb \u00d7R3 and A = F \u2217 (Aq |I\u01eb \u00d7R3 ). We start by compar \u0303\ning the projections P (x) and P\u0303 (x) from V onto coker \u2206(x) and coker \u2206(x)\nrespectively,\nand show that\n(P\u0303 (x) \u2212 P (x))|\u1ebc = O(\u03c7)\n\n(3.111)\n\nas \u03c7 \u2192 0. It follows that for sufficiently small \u03c7, P is an isomorphism as a map from\n\u1ebc|{\u03c7\u226a1} to E. We can then compare \u00c3 with the pull-back of A under P .\n\nThe proof of (3.111) is taken almost directly from [17, Section 2] and follows from estimates on the Green's function G(x) = (\u2206\u2217 (x)\u2206(x))\u22121 \u2206\u2217 (x) of \u2206(x). Equations (3.30)\nand (3.31) imply that\nh\u2206\u2217 (x)\u2206(x)w, widual \u2265\n96\n\nC2\nkwk2L2\n\u03c72\n\n(3.112)\n\n\ffor all w \u2208 W and for sufficiently small \u03c7. (Throughout, C is a constant used in the\ngeneric sense.) Since \u2206(x)G(x) = 1 \u2212 P (x) it follows that\nkvk2L2 \u2212 kP (x)vk2L2 \u2265\n\nC2\nkG(x)vk2L2\n\u03c72\n\nfor all v \u2208 V , so that\nkG(x)kL2 \u2192L2 \u2264\n\n\u03c7\n,\nC\n\nand kG\u2217 (x)kL2 \u2192L2 \u2264\n\n\u03c7\n.\nC\n\n(3.113)\n\nStrictly speaking, G is a map L20 \u2192 L21 , so kGkL2 \u2192L2 is the norm of the composition\n\nof G with inclusion into L20 . Similarly, G\u2217 (x) is a map L2\u22121 \u2192 L20 , so kG\u2217 (x)kL2 \u2192L2 is\n\nthe norm of the restriction of G\u2217 (x) to L20 \u0592\u2192 L2\u22121 . Fixing an element \u1e7d of \u1ebc, we have\n(P\u0303 (x) \u2212 P (x))\u1e7d = (1 \u2212 P (x))\u1e7d\n\n= G\u2217 (x)\u2206\u2217 (x)\u1e7d\n\n= G\u2217 (x)A\u2217 \u1e7d\nwhere\n \u0303\nA = \u2206(x) \u2212 \u2206(x)\nis a multiplicative operator that is independent of x for sufficiently small \u03c7. Since A\nis uniformly bounded and smooth, A\u2217 \u1e7d is L2 , and together with estimate (3.113) this\nproves equation (3.111).\nThe next step is to compare A and \u00c3. Equation (3.111) implies that P is an\nisomorphism as a map P : \u1ebc \u2192 E for sufficiently small \u03c7. Let R \u2282 I\u01eb \u00d7 R3 be some\nregion \u03c7 < \u01eb on which P is an isomorphism. Consider the pull-back of A|R under P :\n\nthe difference between the connections on \u1ebc|R is an endomorphism-valued 1-form \u03b1,\ngiven by\n\u03b1(s) = \u00c3(s) \u2212 PE\u22121 A(P s)\nwhere PE\u22121 is the inverse of P as a map \u1ebc \u2192 E, so that PE\u22121 P = P\u0303 . Expanding \u03b1 using\n\nA = P * d and \u00c3 = P\u0303 * d gives\n\n\u03b1(s) = \u2212P\u0303 dP s\n\nwhere s is a section of \u1ebc. Using the identity P\u0303 dP\u0303 P\u0303 = 0 and the fact that P\u0303 s = s, this\ngives\n\u03b1 = P\u0303 (dP\u0303 \u2212 dP )P\u0303 .\nOur aim is to prove that \u03b1 is C\u03c70,1 and that the dx0 , dy1 , dy2 components of \u03b1 vanish\n2 .\nat the boundary-this will imply that A and \u00c3 are framed in the same way on S\u221e\n\nNow,\n \u0303 \u2206\n \u0303\u2217\nP\u0303 \u2212 P = \u2206\u03c1\u2206\u2217 \u2212 \u2206\u03c1\u0303\n97\n\n\f \u0303\nwhere \u03c1(x) = (\u2206\u2217 (x)\u2206(x))\u22121 and similarly for \u03c1\u0303(x). Since \u2206(x) = \u2206(x)\n+ A on R, we\nhave\n \u0303 + A)\u03c1(\u2206\n \u0303 \u2217 + A\u2217 ) \u2212 \u2206\u03c1\u0303\n \u0303 \u2206\n \u0303 \u2217.\nP\u0303 \u2212 P = (\u2206\n\n(3.114)\n\nHence\n\u0001\nP\u0303 (dP\u0303 \u2212 dP )P\u0303 = P\u0303 (dx + A)\u03c1A\u2217 + A\u03c1(dx\u2217 + A\u2217 ) + A(d\u03c1)A\u2217 P\u0303 .\n\n(3.115)\n\nBy making the region R sufficiently small, A is multiplicative and therefore smooth on\neach interval. Thus \u03c1 is only passed L2 sections in equation (3.115), so we regard \u03c1 as\nbeing restricted to L2 sections. A similar comment applies to the image of \u03c1, so \u03c1 can\nbe regarded as a map from L2 sections to L2 sections rather than L2\u22121 \u2192 L21 . As such,\n\nequations (3.30) and (3.31) give\n\n\u03c1L2 \u2192L2 (x) = \u03c72 + O(\u03c73 ).\n\n(3.116)\n\nIt follows from (3.115) that the dx0 , dy1 , and dy2 components of \u03b1 are O(\u03c7), and\nsimilarly any derivative of these components of the form \u2202xi 0 \u2202yj1 \u2202yk2 is O(\u03c7). Hence the\ndx0 , dy1 , and dy2 components of \u03b1 are C\u03c70 and vanish on the boundary.\nNext consider the d\u03c7 component of \u03b1: using equation (3.116), it is given by\n\u0001\nP\u0303 (x\u0302\u03c7\u22122 + A)\u03c1A\u2217 d\u03c7 + A\u03c1(x\u0302\u2217 \u03c7\u22122 + A\u2217 )d\u03c7 + A(\u2202\u03c7 \u03c1)A\u2217 d\u03c7 P\u0303\n\n\u0001\n= P\u0303 x\u0302A\u2217 d\u03c7 + Ax\u0302\u2217 d\u03c7 P\u0303 + O(\u03c7)\n\nwhere x\u0302 = \u03c7x is the unit vector in direction x. In the basis w\u03031 , . . . , w\u0303n of \u1ebc, \u03b1 is given\nby the matrix\nh\u03b1w\u0303i , w\u0303j i,\n\ni, j = 1, . . . , n.\n\nSo, up to O(\u03c7), the d\u03c7 component is given by\nh(x\u0302A\u2217 + Ax\u0302\u2217 )\u1e7di , \u1e7dj i.\n\n(3.117)\n\nIn the limit \u03c7 \u2192 0 the \u1e7di become 'square roots of \u03b4-functions': integral estimates like\nthose in Section 3.4.1 show that\n\n(\n0\nif i 6= j\nlim hA\u1e7di , \u1e7dj i =\n\u03c7\u21920\nhA(\u03bcp )ep , ep i if i = j = p\n\n(3.118)\n\nfor any multiplicative operator A that is independent of \u03c7, where {ep } is the gauge\n\non E\u221e fixed in Proposition 3.83. Hence the limit of (3.117) exists as \u03c7 \u2192 0 which\n\nshows that the d\u03c7 component of \u03b1 is continuous up to the boundary. In fact it shows\nthe d\u03c7 component is diagonal on the boundary and independent of x0 -so the d\u03c7\ncomponent satisfies the conditions given in Section 2.1.6. Similarly, by considering\nderivatives in x0 , y1 , and y2 , it can be shown that the d\u03c7 component of \u03b1 is C\u03c70 up to\n98\n\n\fthe boundary. The same method shows that the dx0 , dy1 , and dy2 components of \u03b1\nare C\u03c71 : differentiating (3.115) with respect to \u03c7, the coefficients of the dx0 , dy1 , and\ndy2 components are of the form\nmultiplicative operator + O(\u03c7)\nand so extend to the boundary. Thus \u03b1 is C\u03c70,1 .\nLet F\u0303 be the isomorphism F\u0303 : \u1ebc \u2192 Eq |I\u01eb \u00d7R3 whose existence was proved in Propo-\n\nsition 3.83. Let F = F\u0303 PE\u22121 , so that F is an isomorphism E \u2192 Eq defined on R. We\nhave shown that\n\nA = F \u2217 (Aq |R )\n\n(3.119)\n\nwhere Aq is a C\u03c70,1 connection on Eq framed by A\u221e , \u03a6\u221e . The isomorphism F can be\nextended to the interior of R3 so that (3.119) holds everywhere on I\u01eb \u00d7 R3 . (Given\n\nA, this determines Aq on the interior.) To complete the proof of the Proposition, it\nremains to be shown that Aq is quasi-periodic, and that F can be replaced with some\nunitary isomorphism.\nDefine\nc(s) = F (x0 = s + 2\u03c0/\u03bc0 )U\u03c4 F \u22121 (x0 = s).\nEquation (3.37) implies that\nAq (s + 2\u03c0/\u03bc0 ) = (c\u22121 (s))\u2217 Aq (s) = cAq (s)c\u22121 \u2212 dcc\u22121\n\n(3.120)\n\non I\u01eb \u00d7 R3 . We want to show that c \u2192 1 as \u03c7 \u2192 0 and that c is C\u03c71 . In the gauge\n\nF P w\u03031 , . . . , F P w\u0303n on Eq |R , c is given by the matrix\n\nhF (s + 2\u03c0/\u03bc0 )U\u03c4 P w\u0303i (s), F (s + 2\u03c0/\u03bc0 )P w\u0303j (s + 2\u03c0/\u03bc0 )iL2 =\n\nhPE\u22121 U\u03c4 P w\u0303j (s), w\u0303j (s + 2\u03c0/\u03bc0 )iL2\n\n(3.121)\n\nbecause F = F\u0303 PE\u22121 and F\u0303 is unitary. Now (3.111) implies that the RHS is given by\nhU\u03c4 w\u0303i , w\u0303j i + O(\u03c7) = hU\u03c4 \u1e7di , \u1e7dj i + O(\u03c7)\n= \u03b4ij + O(\u03c7),\n \u0303\nwhere \u1e7dj is the approximate solution associated to the solution w\u0303j of \u2206(x).\nHence\nc \u2192 1 as \u03c7 \u2192 0. Equation (3.120) implies that\nlim dc = lim {cAq (s) \u2212 Aq (s + 2\u03c0/\u03bc0 )c}\n\n\u03c7\u21920\n\n\u03c7\u21920\n\nand since Aq is C\u03c70,1 it follows that c is C\u03c71 .\nThe final step is to replace F with a unitary isomorphism and show that this does\nnot affect the framing or clutching adversely. As in Section 3.4.3 we replace P with the\nunitary approximation PU defined by\nPU = (P P \u2217 )\u22121/2 P,\n99\n\n\fand compare \u00c3 with the pull-back of A under PU .

This shows that A is a C\u03c70,1 connection. Moreover, it also follows\nthat the d\u03c7 component of \u03b1U is diagonal and independent of x0 on the boundary, so\nA\u03c7 satisfies the conditions defined in Section 2.1.6.\nThe final check is to ensure that the clutching behaviour of Aq has not been disturbed by the change to a unitary isomorphism. The equation for the matrix of c,\nequation (3.121), becomes\nhPU\u22121 U\u03c4 PU w\u0303i , PU w\u0303j i = hU\u03c4 w\u0303i , w\u0303j i + O(\u03c7)\nbecause of equation (3.122). But the RHS is \u03b4ij + O(\u03c7) so c \u2192 1 as r \u2192 \u221e, and c is\n\nstill C\u03c71 .\n\n\u2737\n\nIt seems that the Proposition could be extended quite readily to show that A is the\ninterior restriction of a framed quasi-periodic connection Aq that is smooth up to the\nboundary, rather than C\u03c70,1 . First we should indicate why this seems difficult initially.\nThe difficulty comes when one considers \u03c7 derivatives of\nh\u03b1w\u0303i , w\u0303j i = h\u03b1\u1e7di , \u1e7dj i + smooth exponentially small term.\n\n(3.123)\n\nTo prove smoothness, all the \u03c7 derivatives of (3.123) must extend continuously to \u03c7 = 0.\nHowever, the \u03c7 derivative of \u1e7dp includes terms like 1/\u03c7, and it is unclear how to make\nthese terms cancel to obtain the desired smoothness result. However, the method used\nin the Proposition to show that the d\u03c7 component of \u03b1 is C\u03c70 could be used to obtain\nsmoothness in the following way. The proof of the Proposition included the calculation\nof the first few terms in the \u03c7 power series expansion of \u03b1: the proof relied on the fact\nthat the leading coefficients for dx0 , dy1 , dy2 vanished, and that the leading coefficient in\nd\u03c7 was multiplicative. Equation (3.118) showed how this multiplicative term extended\nto the boundary-a more general operator would not have a limit like (3.118). However,\nall the coefficients in the power series expansion of \u03b1 will be 'differential operators\nof negative degree', so should have limits like (3.118). Some careful analysis of the\nsmoothing properties of the Green's function \u03c1 could therefore lead to the stronger\nresult.\nWe can use the Proposition to prove Lemma 3.11 for Nahm data in NMon (~k, ~\u03bc). (Re-\n\ncall that we have not yet proved Lemma 3.11 for monopole Nahm data that does not\nsatisfy Nahm's equation and that might be continuous accross zero jumps.) Suppose\nthat \u2206 is the Nahm operator associated to an element of NMon (~k, \u03bc\n~ ). Then Propo-\n\nsition 3.110 implies that Coker \u2206 is the interior restriction of a U (n) quasi-periodic\nconnection framed by A\u221e , \u03a6\u221e . However, Coker \u2206 is translation invariant, and so must\nhave k0 = 0. Applying (2.32) therefore gives\nZ\n1\nch2 Coker \u2206 = \u2212 (\u03bc1 k1 + * * * + \u03bcn kn ).\n\u03bc0\n[0,2\u03c0/\u03bc0 ]\u00d7R3\n101\n\n\fand we have proved Lemma 3.11.\nNext we apply the Proposition to our deformation \u2206s :\nCorollary 3.124. Consider the path \u2206s defined by Proposition 3.106, and fix some\ns \u2208 [0, 1]. The proof of Proposition 3.110 goes through if we replace (E, A) by Coker \u2206s\n\nsince it only relies on properties (3.107) and (3.108). Hence for each s there exists a\nquasi-periodic connection Aqs on Eq which is framed by A\u221e , \u03a6\u221e and which is C\u03c70,1 , such\nthat Coker \u2206s is the interior restriction of (Eq , Aqs ).\nRecall that \u2206 was constructed from a set of Nahm data with boundary data\n(k0 , ~k, \u03bc0 , \u03bc\n~ ). Since Aqs is framed by A\u221e , \u03a6\u221e for each s, it must have boundary data\n(K(s), ~k, \u03bc0 , \u03bc\n~ ) where K(s) \u2208 Z for each s, and so equation (2.32) gives\nZ\n\n[0,2\u03c0/\u03bc0 ]\u00d7R3\n\nch2 (Coker \u2206s ) = \u2212K(s) \u2212\n\n1\n(\u03bc1 k1 + * * * + \u03bcn kn ).\n\u03bc0\n\n(3.125)\n\nBut the LHS of this equation is continuous in s, and since \u03bc0 , \u03bc\n~ , ~k are constant, K is\nconstant. From Section 3.5 we know K(s = 1) = k0 , so K(s = 0) = k0 , and we have\nproved the following:\nTheorem (Nahm data \u2192 caloron, U (n) version). Suppose (k0 , ~k, \u03bc0 , ~\u03bc) is a set of\nprincipal U (n) caloron boundary data. Given an element of N (k0 , ~k, \u03bc0 , \u03bc\n~ ) let \u2206(x) :\nW \u2192 V be the corresponding Nahm operator. Then, up to gauge transformation,\n\nCoker \u2206 is the interior restriction of a U (n) framed quasi-periodic connection Aq on\nEq with boundary data (k0 , ~k, \u03bc0 , \u03bc\n~ ), i.e. an element of C(k0 , ~k, \u03bc0 , \u03bc\n~ ). This construc-\n\ntion takes elements of N \u2217 (k0 , ~k, \u03bc0 , ~\u03bc) to anti-self-dual connections i.e. elements of\nC \u2217 (k0 , ~k, \u03bc0 , ~\n\u03bc). Moreover, using the rotation maps \u03c1N and \u03c1C , the construction extends to non-principal boundary data as explained in Section 3.2.6.\n\n3.6.3\n\nVolume forms\n\nA periodic volume form on E, parallel with respect to A, corresponds to a volume form\n\u03bd on Eq , parallel with respect to Aq , and clutching according to the rule\n\u03bd(w1 (x0 = s + 2\u03c0/\u03bc0 ), . . . , wn (x0 = s + 2\u03c0/\u03bc0 )) =\n\u03bd(c(s)w1 (x0 = s), . . . , c(s)wn (x0 = s)).\nwhere Aq and c are defined by Proposition 3.110. Our aim is to prove that such a\nvolume form exists when the boundary data (k0 , ~k, \u03bc0 , \u03bc\n~ ) is SU (n) and the caloron\nconfiguration Coker \u2206 is anti-self-dual.\nLet FAq denote the curvature of Aq ; a parallel volume form exists on Eq if tr FAq = 0.\nIf Aq is anti-self-dual, then tr FAq is the curvature of an anti-self-dual finite action\nabelian field on I\u01eb \u00d7 R3 , and so vanishes. Hence Eq can indeed be equipped with a\n102\n\n\fparallel volume form \u03bd. Since \u03bd is parallel and Aq is compatible with the clutching map\nc, it follows that there exists a constant \u03bb with |\u03bb| = 1 such that\n\u03bd(c(s)w1 (x0 = s), . . . , c(s)wn (x0 = s)) = \u03bb\u03bd(w1 (x0 = s), . . . , wn (x0 = s))\n\n(3.126)\n\nfor any sections w1 , . . . , wn of Eq . We want to show that \u03bb = 1, so that \u03bd corresponds\nto a periodic object on E. Since \u03bb is independent of x and all the objects are continuous\n2 .\nup to the boundary, we can evaluate \u03bb by working on S\u221e\n\nSuppose that the sections w1 , . . . , wn are parallel in the x0 direction i.e. satisfy\n\u03b9\u2202x0 (\u2207Aq (wj )) = 0\nfor each j. Then\n\u03bd(w1 (x0 = s + 2\u03c0/\u03bc0 ), . . . , wn (x0 = s + 2\u03c0/\u03bc0 )) = \u03bd(w1 (x0 = s), . . . , wn (x0 = s)).\n(3.127)\n2 : in the gauge e , . . . , e on S 2 , the\nIt is easy to construct parallel solutions on S\u221e\n1\nn\n\u221e\n\ndx0 component of Aq is Aqx0 = diag(i\u03bc1 , . . . , i\u03bcn ). Hence wj = (exp \u2212ix0 \u03bcj )ej defines a\n\nlinearly independent set of sections that are parallel in the x0 direction. Substituting\n\nthese sections into equation (3.127) gives\n\u03bd(x0 =0) (e1 , . . . , en ) = \u03bd(x0 =2\u03c0/\u03bc0 ) ((exp \u22122\u03c0i\u03bc1 /\u03bc0 )e1 , . . . , (exp \u22122\u03c0i\u03bcn /\u03bc0 )en )\nn\nY\n\u0001\nexp \u22122\u03c0i\u03bcp /\u03bc0 \u03bd(x0 =2\u03c0/\u03bc0 ) (e1 , . . . , en )\n=\n1\n\n= \u03bd(x0 =2\u03c0/\u03bc0 ) (e1 , . . . , en ),\n\nsince\n\nPn\n1\n\n(3.128)\n\n\u03bcp = 0. However, the clutching map c is the identity on the boundary, so\n\nequation (3.126) becomes\n\u03bd(x0 =2\u03c0/\u03bc0 ) (e1 , . . . , en ) = \u03bb\u03bd(x0 =0) (e1 , . . . , en ).\n\n(3.129)\n\nTogether, equations (3.128) and (3.129) imply that \u03bb = 1, and so we have shown that\nthe volume form corresponds to a periodic object on E. Hence we have established:\nTheorem (Nahm data \u2192 caloron, SU (n) version). Suppose (k0 , ~k, \u03bc0 , \u03bc\n~ ) is a set of\nSU (n) caloron boundary data. Given an element of N \u2217 (k0 , ~k, \u03bc0 , \u03bc\n~ ) let \u2206(x) : W \u2192 V\n\nbe the corresponding Nahm operator. Then Coker \u2206 is the interior restriction of an\nSU (n) framed quasi-periodic connection Aq on Eq corresponding to some element of\nC \u2217 (k0 , ~k, \u03bc0 , ~\n\u03bc).\n\n103\n\n\fChapter 4\n\nFrom Calorons to Nahm Data\nWe present the Nahm transform from calorons to Nahm data: our aim is to prove\nthat the Nahm transform is a well-defined map from C \u2217 (k0 , ~k, \u03bc0 , \u03bc\n~ ) to N \u2217 (k0 , ~k, \u03bc0 , ~\u03bc).\n\nThroughout this Chapter we work with a fixed SU (n) anti-self-dual caloron configuration, i.e. a bundle and connection (E, A) in C \u2217 (k0 , ~k, \u03bc0 , ~\u03bc), framed by the pair A\u221e , \u03a6\u221e .\n\n4.1\n\nGeneralizing the 4-torus Nahm transform\n\nMany of the more formal aspects of the Nahm transform carry over directly from the 4torus case described in 1.1.5 to the caloron case. We cover these in this Section, delaying\nthe real difficulties-the calculation of the index of the Dirac operators involved, and\nrecovering the behaviour of the Nahm data at singularities-till later.\n\n4.1.1\n\nDefining the transform\n\nGiven the caloron (E, A), recall the definitions (1.12) and (1.13) of the Dirac operators\n1\n\u00d7 R3 . Following the ideas of Section 1.1.5, the transform from the caloron\nDA\u00b1 on S2\u03c0/\u03bc\n0\n\nto its Nahm data involves the kernel of a family of Dirac operators parameterized by\n\u00b1\nthe dual torus S\u03bc10 .

By\n\ndefinition, (E, A) is framed on \u2202X and we can extend the framing to a neighbourhood\nU of \u2202X, to give an identification of E|U with p\u2217 E. In this identification we can write\n\u2207A \u2212 i\u03bedx0 = \u2207A + dx0 (\u2202x0 + \u03a6 \u2212 i\u03be)\n\n(4.6)\n\nwhere \u03a6(x) \u2208 End(E) for each x, and \u03a6 \u2192 \u03a6\u221e as r \u2192 \u221e.

This is entirely analogous to Section 3.2.5,\nwhere we showed that Coker \u2206 is periodic for a given Nahm operator \u2206.\nDefine the translation\n\u03c4\u0302 : \u03be 7\u2192 \u03be + \u03bc0\nand let\n\u00db\u03c4\u0302 = exp i\u03bc0 x0 .\n(Compare this with equation (3.36).)

It follows that\n+\n+\ncoker DA,\u03c4\u0302\n\u03be = \u00db\u03c4\u0302 coker DA,\u03be\n\nfor \u03be \u2208 R \\ \u03besing , and\n\nP\u0302\u03c4\u0302 \u03be = \u00db\u03c4\u0302 P\u0302\u03be \u00db\u03c4\u0302\u22121\n\n+\nwhere P\u0302\u03be : W 0 (S \u2212 \u2297 E) \u2192 W 0 (S \u2212 \u2297 E) is the projection onto coker DA,\u03be\nfor each \u03be.\n\nSubstituting this back into definitions (4.7) and (4.8) gives\n\u2207(\u03be + \u03bc0 ) = \u00db\u03c4\u0302 \u2207(\u03be)\u00db\u03c4\u0302\u22121\nand\nT j (\u03be + \u03bc0 ) = \u00db\u03c4\u0302 T j (\u03be)\u00db\u03c4\u0302\u22121\n\nj = 1, 2, 3\n\nwhere we have dropped the subscript p, N on the Nahm data. Thus \u00db\u03c4\u0302 defines an action\nof Z on the collection of bundles Xp,N , and the connection and endomorphisms defined\nby (4.7) and (4.8) are compatible with this action. Quotienting by the action, the data\nreduces to a collection of hermitian bundles Xp defined on the intervals Ip\u25e6 \u2282 S\u03bc10 , where\n\nIp\u25e6 = (\u03bcp+1 , \u03bcp ) + \u03bc0 Z for p = 1, . . . , n \u2212 1, and In\u25e6 = (\u03bc1 \u2212 \u03bc0 , \u03bcn ) + \u03bc0 Z. Since the\nconnection and endomorphisms are compatible with this action, under the quotient\nthey map to a connection \u2207p and endomorphisms Tpj , j = 1, 2, 3, on each bundle Xp .\n\n4.1.4\n\nFurther remarks on the rotation map\n\nIn analogy with Section 3.2.6, we want the following diagram to commute:\nC(B)\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\u03c1C y\n\nNahm\n\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\ntransform\n\nNahm\n\nN (B)\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\u03c1\nyN\n\nC(\u03c1\u2202 B) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 N (\u03c1\u2202 B)\ntransform\n\n108\n\n\fwhere \u03c1C and \u03c1\u2202 were defined in Section 2.2, and \u03c1N is defined by rotating the Nahm\ndata by \u03bc0 /n as in equation (3.38). Given our caloron (E, A), traversing the diagram\nround the top right (i.e. performing the Nahm transform followed by a rotation) is\nequivalent to performing the Nahm transform with the Dirac operator\n+\n+\nDB,\u03be\n= DA,(\u03be\u2212\u03bc\n0 /n)\n+\nrather than the Dirac operator DA,\u03be\n, where B = A + i(\u03bc0 /n)dx0 . By 'equivalent' we\n\nmean the two sets of Nahm data are isomorphic over S\u03bc10 with a fixed origin. In the\nquasi-periodic picture suppose that Aq , Bq are framed quasi-periodic connections on Eq\ncorresponding to A and B. Then\nBq = g(Aq )\nwhere g(s) = exp \u2212i(\u03bc0 s/n). If Aq has clutching function c, then so does Bq since\n\u0001\n\u0001\nBq (s + 2\u03c0/\u03bc0 ) = \u03c9c Aq (s) = \u03c9c Bq (s) ,\n\nand \u03c9 = g(2\u03c0/\u03bc0 ) = exp \u22122\u03c0i/n acts trivially as a gauge transformation. (Recall that\n\nclutching functions must be the identity at spatial infinity.)\n\nConversely, traversing around the bottom left of the diagram is just the Nahm\ntransform on \u03c1C (A). The quasi-periodic pull-back of \u03c1C (A) is \u03c1(Aq ) where \u03c1 is the\nbundle automorphism of Eq defined in Section 2.2. We know that \u0398 := g\u03c1\u22121 is a\nbundle automorphism of Eq taking \u03c1(Aq ) to Bq . If \u0398 descends to give a strictly periodic\nisomorphism identifying \u03c1C (A) with B then the diagram commutes. A section \u03c8 of Eq\ndescends to a periodic section under the quotient by a clutching function c, if and only\nif it satisfies\n\u03c8(s + 2\u03c0/\u03bc0 ) = c\u03c8(s).\nNow, \u03c1(Aq ) has clutching function c\u03c1 given by (2.34), so consider a section of Eq satisfying\n\u03c8(s + 2\u03c0/\u03bc0 ) = c\u03c1 \u03c8(s).\nThen under the action of \u0398 we have\n\u0398\u03c8(s + 2\u03c0/\u03bc0 ) = g(s + 2\u03c0/\u03bc0 )\u03c1\u22121 (s + 2\u03c0/\u03bc0 )c\u03c1 (s)\u03c8(s)\n= \u03c9g(s)\u03c1\u22121 (s + 2\u03c0/\u03bc0 )\u03c9 \u22121 \u03c1(s + 2\u03c0/\u03bc0 )c(s)\u03c1\u22121 (s)\u03c8(s)\n= c\u0398\u03c8(s)\nwhere c is the clutching function of Bq , and so \u0398\u03c8 descends to a periodic section under\nthe quotient by c. Thus \u0398 descends to a strictly periodic bundle isomorphism taking\n\u03c1C (A) to B and we have shown that the diagram commutes.\n\n109\n\n\f4.2\n\nThe Fredholm condition\n\nWe need to prove the Fredholm condition stated in Section 4.1.1:\n+\nProposition 4.11. DA,\u03be\nis Fredholm iff \u03be \u2208\n/ \u03besing .\n\nThis ensures that the bundles Xp,N are well-defined. We also need to calculate the\n+\nis injective, the rank of Xp,N is given by minus the\nrank of these bundles. Since DA,\u03be\n+\n\u25e6 , and so the problem is equivalent to finding the index of\nindex of DA,\u03be\nfor any \u03be \u2208 Ip,N\n\n+\nDA,\u03be\n, which we calculate in Section 4.3. The proof of the Fredholm condition and the\n\nindex calculation have been published jointly with my supervisor in [36]-the material\nin this Section and Section 4.3 is taken more-or-less directly from that paper.\nWe give two proofs of Proposition 4.11: the first uses Anghel's criterion [2], while\nthe second uses the machinery of pseudo-differential operators (\u03a8DO's) on manifolds\nwith fibred boundary [27]. Using this machinery in Section 4.2.3 we prove that solutions\n+\nin coker DA,\u03be\nare exponentially decaying in r, so that (4.8) makes sense.\n\n4.2.1\n\nProof of the Fredholm condition using Anghel's criterion\n\n\u2212\n+\nto be Fredholm: DA,\u03be is\n\u2295 DA,\u03be\nTheorem 2.1 of [2] gives conditions for DA,\u03be := DA,\u03be\n\nFredholm if and only if there is a compact set K \u2282 X o and a constant C > 0 such that\nkDA,\u03be \u03c8kL2 \u2265 Ck\u03c8kL2 , when \u03c8 \u2208 W 1 (S \u2297 E) and Supp(\u03c8) \u2282 X o \\ K.\n+\nis Fredholm.

As in the proof of Lemma 4.4, extend the framing f to a neighbourhood of \u2202X. In this identification we can define A, \u03a6 using (4.6). As the boundary \u2202X\nis approached the eigenvalues of \u03a6 converge to the eigenvalues of \u03a6\u221e . Using spherical\npolar coordinates on R3 , let i\u03bbj (r, y1 , y2 , x0 ) be the eigenvalues of \u03a6, and i\u03bcj be the\neigenvalues of \u03a6\u221e (j = 1, . . . , n) such that \u03bbj \u2192 \u03bcj as r \u2192 \u221e. Let \u03bb(r, y1 , y2 , x0 ) be\nthe smallest element in {|\u03bbj + N \u03bc0 \u2212 \u03be| : j = 1, . . . , n; N \u2208 Z} and \u03bc be the smallest\n\nelement of the set {|\u03bcj + N \u03bc0 \u2212 \u03be| : j = 1, . . . , n; N \u2208 Z}. The condition \u03be \u2208\n/ \u03besing\n\nimplies that \u03bc > 0, so there exists a compact set K1 \u2282 X o such that \u03bb > \u03bc/2 on\nX o \\ K1 .\n\n110\n\n\fSuppose \u03c8 \u2208 W 2 (S + \u2297 E) and Supp \u03c8 \u2282 X o \\ K1 . Using the isomorphism S + \u223c\n=\n\np\u2217 S(3) , \u03c8 can be written as a Fourier series\n\u03c8=\n\nX\n\nexp(iN \u03bc0 x0 )\u03c6N\n\nN\n\nwhere \u03c6N is a section of S(3) \u2297 E.

(Since \u03c8 (N ) \u2208 W 2 (S + \u2297 E), \u03c8 (N ) is actually continuous so\n\nboth sides of the inequality exist.) Since the inequality is independent of N it holds for\n\ngeneral \u03c8 and we obtain\nSupp(\u03c8) \u2282 X o \\ K1 \u21d2 h\u2212(\u22070 \u2212 i\u03be)2 \u03c8, \u03c8iL2 \u2265\n\n1 2\n\u03bc k\u03c8k2L2 .\n4\n\n(4.12)\n\nThe second term. We have\n[DA , \u22070 ] =\n\nX\nj\n\n\u03b3j [\u2207j , \u22070 ] =\n\nX\nj\n\n\u03b3j {\u03b9(\u2202j )(\u2207A \u03a6 \u2212 \u2202x0 A)}\n\nwhere \u03b9(\u03b8) denotes the interior product with a tangent vector \u03b8, DA is defined by (4.2),\nand A is defined by (4.6). But, using (2.28), k\u2207A \u03a6 \u2212 \u2202x0 Ak \u2192 0 as r \u2192 \u221e, so there\n\nexists a compact set K2 \u2282 X o such that\n\n1\nSupp(\u03c8) \u2282 X o \\ K2 \u21d2 |h[DA , \u22070 ]\u03c8, \u03c8iL2 | \u2264 \u03bc2 k\u03c8k2L2 .\n8\n\n(4.13)\n\nNow let K be a compact set containing K1 and K2 .

I am indebted to my supervisor for explaining \u03a8DO's on\n\nmanifolds with boundary to me; the proof of the Fredholm condition using \u03a8DO's is\ndue to him.\nThe general situation considered in [27] is a fibration of the boundary \u2202X of X:\np\n\nU \u2212\u2192 \u2202X \u2212\u2212\u2192 Y\nwhere U is the fibre, and p is projection onto the base Y .

They consider differential operators of the form\n\nP (\u03c7, y, u; \u03c72 \u2202\u03c7 , \u03c7\u2202y , \u2202u ),\n\n(4.14)\n\nnear \u2202X, where P is smooth in the first three variables and polynomial in the last three\nvariables. Here y and u are coordinates on Y and U respectively. These operators form\nthe algebra of \u03a6-differential operators. (Note that this \u03a6 has nothing to do with the\ndx0 component of A, but stands for 'fibred cusp' in [27].) In [27, Proposition 9] it is\nshown that such an operator is Fredholm in L2 if and only if it is fully elliptic in the\nfollowing sense. First, (4.14) must be elliptic in the usual sense over X o . This will\nalways be the case for Dirac operators. Secondly, the associated indicial family must\nbe invertible on every fibre p\u22121 (y) \u2282 \u2202X. Given such a fibre, the indicial family on\n\np\u22121 (y) is defined by picking a real number \u03b6 and a real cotangent vector \u03b7 \u2208 Ty\u2217 Y , and\ndefining\n\nI\u03a6 (P )(y,\u03b7,\u03b6) = P (0, y, u; i\u03b6, i\u03b7, \u2202u )\nas a differential operator on p\u22121 (y). To say that the indicial family is invertible is to\nsay that I\u03a6 (P )(y,\u03b7,\u03b6) is invertible (in any reasonable space of sections over p\u22121 (y)), for\neach choice of (y, \u03b7, \u03b6) as above.\nFor our example, we work with the boundary-adapted coordinates \u03c7, y1 , y2 , x0 and\ndenote the components of \u2207A in these coordinates by\n\u2207\u03c7 = \u2202\u03c7 + A\u03c7 , \u2207yj = \u2202yj + Ayj , \u2207x0 = \u2202x0 + Ax0 .\n112\n\n\fRelative to a suitable choice of basis for the spin-bundles, we have then\n+\nDA,\u03be\n= \u2207x0 + \u03b31 \u03c7\u2207y1 + \u03b32 \u03c7\u2207y2 + \u03b33 \u03c72 \u2207\u03c7 \u2212 i\u03be.\n\n(4.15)\n\nStrictly speaking, we are making a choice of normal coordinates here; otherwise there\n+\nwill be additional zero-order terms coming from connection coefficients. Hence DA,\u03be\nis\n\na \u03a6-differential operator as defined by [27]. Following the recipe for the indicial family\n+\nfor DA,\u03be\n, we obtain\n\nI\u03a6 (P )(y,\u03b7,\u03b6) = (\u2207x0 \u2212 i\u03be) + i(\u03b71 \u03b31 + \u03b72 \u03b32 + \u03b6\u03b33 )\n1\nwhere \u03b71 , \u03b72 are real numbers. This operator in C \u221e (S2\u03c0/\u03bc\n, p\u2217 S(3) \u2297 E\u221e ) is a sum of\n0\n\ntwo terms B + A, where A = i(\u03b71 \u03b31 + \u03b72 \u03b32 + \u03b6\u03b33 ) is self-adjoint, B = \u2207x0 \u2212 i\u03be is skew-\n\nadjoint and [A, B] = 0. It follows by considering (A + B)\u2217 (A + B) that (A + B)u = 0\nif and only if Au = 0 and Bu = 0. Now B has a non-trivial null-space only if \u03be \u2208 \u03besing .\n\nHence under the assumption of the Proposition, A + B is injective. Similarly the\nadjoint (A + B)\u2217 = A \u2212 B is injective, so that \u03be \u2208\n/ \u03besing implies that the indicial family\n\n+\nis invertible, and so DA,\u03be\nis Fredholm in L2 . Conversely, if \u03be \u2208 \u03besing , then B is not\n\n+\nis not fully elliptic\ninvertible, and nor is B + A when \u03b7j = 0 = \u03b6. So in this case DA,\u03be\n\nand hence cannot be Fredholm in L2 . This completes the proof of Proposition 4.11\nusing material from [27].\nThe result that a \u03a8DO P is Fredholm if and only if fully elliptic holds in a very\nstrong sense. If P has degree m then P makes sense as an operator between Sobolev\nspaces of degree l and l \u2212 m for all l \u2208 Z. Mazzeo and Melrose prove that if P is fully\nelliptic it is Fredholm between any such spaces, and the index is independent of this\n\nchoice. In fact, they show that if P is fully elliptic, if P \u03c8 = 0, and if for some real m,\n\u03c7m \u03c8 \u2208 L2 (X), then \u03c8 \u2208 C \u221e (X) and \u03c8 vanishes to all orders in \u03c7 at \u2202X. There is a\n\n+\nis Fredholm as an\nsimilar statement for the cokernel. In particular, it follows that DA,\u03be\n\noperator\n+\n1\n1\nDA,\u03be\n: W 1 (S2\u03c0/\u03bc\n\u00d7 R3 , S + \u2297 E) \u2192 W 0 (S2\u03c0/\u03bc\n\u00d7 R3 , S \u2212 \u2297 E)\n0\n0\n\n(i.e. restricted to X o ) if and only if it is Fredholm as a \u03a8DO on X. These strong decay\nconditions also imply the following:\nLemma 4.16. Let A, B be two caloron configurations on (E, f ), framed by (A\u221e , \u03a6\u221e ).\nThen DA+ is Fredholm if and only if DB+ is Fredholm. When the two operators are\nFredholm their L2 -indices coincide.\nProof: That DA+ is Fredholm if and only if DB+ is Fredholm follows directly from\nProposition 4.11. It remains to prove that the operators have the same L2 -index.\n\n113\n\n\fConsider the linear deformation of A into B. This clearly gives rise to a norm-continuous\npath of Dirac operators between Sobolev spaces\nW 1 (X, E \u2297 S + , d\u03bc) \u2192 W 0 (X, E \u2297 S \u2212 , d\u03bc)\n\n(4.17)\n\nwhere d\u03bc is the volume form d\u03bc = h1 h2 dx0 dy1 dy2 in terms of the usual boundaryadapted coordinates. However, X is equipped with the volume form dx0 dx1 dx2 dx3 =\n\u03c7\u22124 d\u03bc near \u03c7 = 0, so it does not necessarily follow that the deformation is normcontinuous between\nW 1 (X, E \u2297 S + , \u03c7\u22124 d\u03bc) \u2192 W 0 (X, E \u2297 S \u2212 , \u03c7\u22124 d\u03bc).\n\n(4.18)\n\nHowever, the decay properties stated above imply that DA+ is Fredholm as an operator\nbetween spaces (4.17) if and only if it is Fredholm as an operator between spaces (4.18),\nand the index is the same. Thus the deformation from A to B preserves the L2 -index.\n\u2737\nWe can prove the Lemma without using [27, Proposition 9] in fact. Let A(s) =\n(1 \u2212 s)A + sB be the linear path joining A and B. Then\nh\n+\n+\nk\n\u2264\n|s\n\u2212\ns\n|\n\u2212\nD\nkDA(s\n1\n2 kAx0 \u2212 Bx0 kL2 + k\u03c7(Ay1 \u2212 By1 )kL2 +\nA(s2 )\n1)\n\nk\u03c7(Ay2 \u2212 By2 )kL2 + k\u03c72 (A\u03c7 \u2212 B\u03c7 )kL2\n\ni\n\nusing an expansion like (4.15) and working in some fixed gauge. It follows that the\n+\nis continuous provided kAx0 \u2212 Bx0 kL2 , k\u03c7(Ayj \u2212 Byj )kL2 , and\npath of operators DA(s)\n\nk\u03c72 (A\u03c7 \u2212 B\u03c7 )kL2 are bounded. Since the volume form near the boundary is \u03c7\u22124 d\u03bc, this\n\nfollows provided we have pointwise estimates |Ax0 \u2212Bx0 |, |\u03c7(Ayj \u2212Byj )|, |\u03c72 (A\u03c7 \u2212B\u03c7 )| =\n\nO(\u03c72 ) as \u03c7 \u2192 0. However, this is true because A and B are framed in the same way\n(using the smoothness assumptions of Section 2.1.6).\n\n4.2.3\n\nDecay properties of zero modes\n\n\u2212\nWe want to show that the solutions to DA,\u03be\n\u03c8 = 0 are exponentially decaying as r \u2192 \u221e\n\nso that the Nahm matrices Tpj j = 1, 2, 3 are well-defined by (4.8).

L+\n\u03be,\u03bb is Fredholm iff |\u03bb| < M\u03be .\nProof: Using the ideas in Section 4.2.2 we prove that the indicial family is invertible\niff |\u03bb| < M , which is sufficient for the claim. Take P to be the \u03a6-differential operator\n\nL+\n\u03be,\u03bb . Constructing the indicial family I\u03a6 (P ) as described in Section 4.2.2 gives\nI\u03a6 (P ) = (\u2207x0 \u2212 i\u03be) + i\u03b71 \u03b31 + i\u03b72 \u03b32 + i\u03b6\u03b33 + \u03bb\u03b33\n\n1\nas an operator on C \u221e (S2\u03c0/\u03bc\n, p\u2217 S(3) \u2297 E\u221e ), in some suitable choice of basis for the\n0\n\nspin-bundles. We can perform a Fourier decomposition in x0 : I\u03a6 (P ) maps each Fourier\nmode to itself, and on the N 'th mode is given by\nI\u03a6 (P )N = \u03a6\u221e + iN \u03bc0 \u2212 i\u03be + i\u03b71 \u03b31 + i\u03b72 \u03b32 + i\u03b6\u03b33 + \u03bb\u03b33 .\nMoreover, I\u03a6 (P ) is invertible if and only if I\u03a6 (P )N is invertible for all N \u2208 Z. Working\non the eigenspace of \u03a6\u221e with eigenvalue i\u03bcj for some j \u2208 {1, . . . , n}, I\u03a6 (P )N is given\n\nby\n\ni\u03bcj + iN \u03bc0 \u2212 i\u03be + i\u03b71 \u03b31 + i\u03b72 \u03b32 + i\u03b6\u03b33 + \u03bb\u03b33 =\n\u0013\n\u0012\ni\u03bcj + iN \u03bc0 \u2212 i\u03be \u2212 \u03b71\n\u2212i\u03b72 \u2212 \u03b6 + i\u03bb\n.\ni\u03b72 \u2212 \u03b6 + i\u03bb\ni\u03bcj + iN \u03bc0 \u2212 i\u03be + \u03b71\nThis matrix has determinant\n[i(\u03bcj + N \u03bc0 \u2212 \u03be) \u2212 \u03b71 ][i(\u03bcj + N \u03bc0 \u2212 \u03be) + \u03b71 ] \u2212 [(i\u03bb \u2212 \u03b6) \u2212 i\u03b72 ][(i\u03bb \u2212 \u03b6) + i\u03b72 ] =\n\n\u2212 (\u03bcj + N \u03bc0 \u2212 \u03be)2 \u2212 \u03b712 \u2212 \u03b722 + \u03bb2 + 2i\u03bb\u03b6 \u2212 \u03b6 2 .

The first is a calculation of\nthe index in the case that there is a trivialisation of E in which A is independent of\nx0 . By Fourier analysis in x0 , the index problem reduces to a problem on R3 which\ncan be dealt with using Callias' index theorem, which we introduced on page 17. By\na deformation argument, this calculation gives the index for any caloron configuration\nwhen c2 (E, f ) = 0, completing the first step. The precise statement of Callias' theorem\nwe will use is:\n116\n\n\f3\n\nTheorem. Let (A, \u03a6) be a U (n) monopole configuration on B framed by (A\u221e , \u03a6\u221e )\nin the sense of Definition 2.4, and let\nDA,\u03a6 = DA + 1 \u2297 \u03a6 : W 1 (R3 , S(3) \u2297 E) \u2192 W 0 (R3 , S(3) \u2297 E)\n\n(4.28)\n\nwhere S(3) is the spin bundle on R3 .

In our case,\nthis result gives ind (DA+ ) \u2212 ind (DB+ ) = \u2212c2 (E, f )[X] if B is any caloron configuration\n\nagreeing with A near \u2202X but living on a new framed bundle (F, f ), with c2 (F, f )[X] = 0.\nSince we calculated ind (DB+ ) in the first step, that completes the proof of Theorem\n4.24.\n\n4.3.1\n\nProof when c2 (E, f )[X] = 0\n\nIn this case, by Lemmas 2.20 and 4.16 it is enough to compute the index when E = p\u2217 E\nand A = p\u2217 A + p\u2217 \u03a6dx0 is the pull-back of a monopole. Then the coefficients of DA+ are\nindependent of x0 and we can use Fourier analysis in x0 to reduce the calculation of\nthe index to that of a collection of operators of the form (4.28).\nLet\nZN = {\u03c8 = exp(iN \u03bc0 x0 )\u03c6 : \u03c6 \u2208 W 0 (R3 , S(3) \u2297 E)}\n\n(4.30)\n\nso that\nW 0 (S + \u2297 E) = {\n\nX\n\nN \u2208Z\n\n\u03c8 (N ) : \u03c8 (N ) \u2208 ZN and\n\nX\n\nN \u2208Z\n\n2\n\nk\u03c8 (N ) k < \u221e}\n\nusing identification (1.16).

Let cext be a bundle isomorphism of Eq that satisfies\n\uf8f1\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2c on ( \u03bc0 \u2212 \u01eb, \u03bc0 + \u01eb) \u00d7 U,\n2 ,\ncext = 1 on I\u01eb \u00d7 S\u221e\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n3\n1 on (\u2212\u01eb, \u01eb) \u00d7 B\n\nand which is arbitrary elsewhere (compare with the proof of Lemma 2.20). By gauge\ntransforming by cext we can assume that c \u2261 1 on U . Define Bq on Eq to agree with\n\nAq on U , but extended over I\u01eb \u00d7 K to define a smooth quasi-periodic connection on Eq\n\nwith trivial clutching function, cB . Note that Aq and Bq are framed in the same way.\n\nLet (B, F) be the quotient of Bq , Eq by cB , so that B is a framed caloron configuration\nwith c2 (F, f ) = 0.\nApplying (4.31),\nind\n\nDA+\n\n\u2212 ind\n\nDB+\n\n=\n\nZ\n\nXo\n\nch2 (E) \u2212\n\nBut\nZ\n\nXo\n\nch2 (E) = \u2212c2 (E, f )[X] \u2212\n118\n\nZ\n\nXo\n\nch2 (F).\n\nN\n1 X\n2\n\u03bcj c1 (E\u03bcj )[S\u221e\n]\n\u03bc0 1\n\n\ffrom (2.31), and\nZ\n\nXo\n\nSo\n\nch2 (F) = \u2212\n\nn\n1 X\n2\n\u03bcj c1 (E\u03bcj )[S\u221e\n].\n\u03bc0\n1\n\nind DA+ = ind DB+ \u2212 c2 (E, f )[X]\nP\n+\n2\nFrom Section 4.3.1 we know that ind DB+ = \u2212 N c1 (E(N\n) )[S\u221e ] so we have proved that\nind DA+ = \u2212c2 (E, f )[X] \u2212\n\nX\n\n2\n+\nc1 (E(N\n) )[S\u221e ].\n\nN\n\nThis completes the proof of Theorem 4.24.\n\n4.4\n\nExtension to the singular points\n\nThe final problem we consider is how to prove the Nahm data constructed from a caloron\nsatisfies the correct gluing and singularity conditions at the points \u03be = \u03bc1 , . . . , \u03bcn . These\nconditions were specified in Sections 3.1.1 and 3.2.1. Nakajima [34, Section 2] showed\nhow to obtain the singularity conditions for Nahm data constructed from an SU (2)\nmonopole, and our approach will follow his quite closely. Nahm data corresponding to\nan SU (2) monopole cannot contain zero jumps, and at the two singularities the continuing component is trivial. (Recall the definitions of the terminating and continuing\ncomponents on page 53.) While Nakajima's method therefore helps us to recover the\nbehaviour for the terminating component, it does not provide much insight into the\ncontinuing component. Hurtubise and Murray's proof [20] that the Nahm data constructed from on SU (n) monopole satisfies the gluing and singularity conditions uses\nthe spectral curve of the monopole. No 'direct proof' via analysis of Dirac operators\nexists to date. Indeed, the proof for calorons would follow quite readily from a 'direct'\nproof for monopoles. We start, in Sections 4.4.1 and 4.4.2, by considering the terminating component for U (n) monopoles, using Nakajima's method and filling in some of\nthe details he misses. In Section 4.4.3 we show how to extend these results for calorons,\nwhile in Section 4.4.4 we consider the continuing component, giving only sketch results\nand conjectures.\n\u2212\nThe main idea is that solutions to DA,\u03be\nare characterized by their asymptotic be1\nhaviour on S2\u03c0/\u03bc\n\u00d7 R3 close to each \u03be \u2208 \u03besing . Suppose that \u03be is close to \u03bcp and let\n0\n\nt = \u03be \u2212 \u03bcp (we will use this definition of t for the remainder of the Chapter). We saw in\n\n\u2212\nSection 4.2.3 that \u03c8 \u2208 coker DA,\u03be\ndecays at least as fast as exp(\u2212r|t|) as r \u2192 0. We will\n\nshow that solutions in the terminating component at \u03bcp are of the form exp(\u2212r|t|) \u00d7\n(non-L2 function), while the motivation behind our results for the continuing compo-\n\nnent is that the corresponding solutions decay like exp(\u2212r|t + \u03b1|) for some \u03b1 6= 0, and\n\nso continue across \u03be = \u03bcp as L2 sections.\n\n119\n\n\f4.4.1\n\nThe model operator for monopoles\n\nWe need to recall the boundary conditions for U (n) monopoles from Chapter 2 and\nthe definition of the Nahm transform for monopoles. Let (E, A) be a U (n) monopole\nframed by A\u221e , \u03a6\u221e with boundary data (~k, \u03bc\n~ ). Just as in Section 2.1.6, we need to\nassume some additional smoothness conditions near the boundary. We assume that\nthere are local gauges on E, defined over some region 0 \u2264 \u03c7 < 1/R in which\n\u2022 \u03a6 = diag(i\u03bc1 , . . . , i\u03bcn ) \u2212 \u03c72 diag(ik1 , . . . , ikn ) + O(\u03c72 ),\n\u2022 Ayj = diag(h\u2202yj ep , ep i) + O(\u03c72 ),\n\nj = 1, 2,\n\n2 , and\n\u2022 A\u03c7 is diagonal on S\u221e\n\n\u2022 \u03a6 is C\u03c71 and A is C\u03c70,1 .\nThese are entirely analogous to the smoothness conditions we assume for calorons in\nSection 2.1.6 (compare with equations (2.24) and (2.25)). Next recall the definition of\nthe Nahm transform for monopoles given in Sections 1.1.6 and 1.1.8. The transform is\ngiven by the cokernel of D\u03be as defined by equation (1.28), and the Nahm data is defined\nby equations (1.30) and (1.31).\nFix a singularity \u03be = \u03bcp with kp > 0, and let k = kp and t = \u03be \u2212 \u03bcp . Nakajima's\n\nmethod is similar to the way we recovered the boundary conditions in Chapter 3. We\ndefine a model operator D\u0303\u03be that approximates D\u03be and find k solutions to D\u0303\u03be\u2217 \u03c8 = 0,\ndefined on some neighbourhood t \u2208 (\u2212\u01eb, 0), for some \u01eb > 0. We then show that these\nsolutions are arbitrarily close to solutions to D\u03be\u2217 \u03c8 = 0 in the limit t \u2192 0\u2212 , thereby\n\nrecovering the terminating component.\n\nThe definition of the model operator uses the following facts about Dirac operators\n2 , taken from [34]. The spin bundle S\n2\non S\u221e\n(2) of S\u221e decomposes into two line bundles\n\u2212\n+\nand there are two Dirac operators\n\u2295 S(2)\nS(2) = S(2)\n2\n\u2213\n2\n\u00b1\n).\n) \u2192 C \u221e (S\u221e\n, S(2)\nD \u00b1 : C \u221e (S\u221e\n, S(2)\n2 \u223c P (C).

Of course, to satisfy\nthe conditions for Nahm data stated on page 50, Bj (t) must be analytic-so in the\ncases k = 2, 3 it seems disturbing that we can only prove Bj (t) is O(t\u22121/2 ). However,\nNahm's equations impose additional strong conditions on Bj , which we will discuss\nin Section 4.4.4. Note that an entirely analogous statement to 4.50 holds for kp < 0,\nessentially by replacing t with \u2212t in the proof of the Proposition.\n\nProof: The proof has two main steps. First we work in the 'approximate gauge'\n\n\u03c8\u03031 , . . . , \u03c8\u0303k and evaluate the matrices\nh\u2202\u03be \u03c8\u0303a , \u03c8\u0303b iL2\n\nand\n\nhixj \u03c8\u0303a , \u03c8\u0303b iL2 for j = 1, 2, 3,\n\n(4.51)\n\nwhere a, b \u2208 {1, . . . , k}. Then, using Corollary 4.47, we use the approximate matrices (4.51) to deduce that the Nahm matrices decompose as described in the claim.\n\nFirst consider evaluating the matrix with entries h\u2202\u03be \u03c8\u0303a , \u03c8\u0303b iL2 . Since \u2202\u03be \u03c8\u0303a = r \u03c8\u0303a ,\n\n\u2202\u03be \u03c8\u0303a is orthogonal to \u03c8\u0303b when a 6= b because fa is orthogonal to fb , and the matrix is\n\ndiagonal. Moreover, because \u03c8\u03031 , . . . , \u03c8\u0303k is an orthonormal set, the diagonal entries are\n\nimaginary. On the other hand, the integral hr \u03c8\u0303a , \u03c8\u0303a iL2 is real, and so the matrix must\nbe zero. Also\n\nhixj \u03c8\u0303a , \u03c8\u0303b iL2 =\n\nR\u221e\nR\n\nR\ndr \u03c62 (r)(exp 2rt)r k+1 P1 (C) dA hix\u0302j fa , fb i\nR\u221e\n2\nk\nR dr \u03c6 (r)(exp 2rt)r\n\nwhere x\u0302j = xj /r is the j'th unit coordinate function on P1 (C), and fa , fb \u2208 H 0 P1 (C),\n\u0001\nO(k \u2212 1) were used to define the approximate solutions. Substituting u = rt into the\nintegrals, we obtain\n\nR\u221e\ndr \u03c62 (r)(exp 2rt)r k+1\nR\nR\u221e\n= \u03b1t\u22121\n2 (r)(exp 2rt)r k\ndr\n\u03c6\nR\n\nfor some non-zero constant \u03b1. Defining the matrix Rpj by\nZ\ndA hix\u0302j fa , fb i\n(Rpj )ab = \u03b1\nP1 (C)\n\nwe have\nhixj \u03c8\u0303a , \u03c8\u0303b iL2 =\n\n(Rpj )ab\nt\n\n(4.52)\n\nand Nakajima's Lemma 4.48 implies that some non-zero constant multiple of the\nmap (4.49) (with Rj := Rpj ) is an irreducible k-dimensional representation of su(2).\n126\n\n\fCorollary 4.47 shows that the projection P\u0302 on to the cokernel of D\u03be satisfies P\u0302 =\n(1 + decaying term) on the span of \u03c8\u03031 , . . . , \u03c8\u0303k . Just as we did in Proposition 3.110, we\ncan replace P\u0302 with its unitarization P\u0302U , so that\nP\u0302U = 1 + Q(t)\non the span of \u03c8\u03031 , . . . , \u03c8\u0303k , where\nQ(t) =\n\n(\n\nO(t)\nwhen k > 3, and\n1/2\nO(t ) when k = 2 or 3.\n\nWe can in fact obtain a better estimate in the case k = 3, but the estimate above is\nsufficient for our purposes. Next define\n\u03c8a := P\u0302U \u03c8\u0303a .\n\n(4.53)\n\nIt follows that \u03c81 , . . . , \u03c8k is an orthonormal set of sections of the bundle Xp defined over\nsome neighbourhood t \u2208 (\u2212\u01eb, 0). The set can be extended by mp\u22121 further sections to\n\ngive a local trivialisation of the bundle Xp .\n\nFor the time being we will assume k > 3 and return to the cases k = 2, 3 later. Now\nh\u2202\u03be \u03c8a , \u03c8b iL2 = h\u2202\u03be \u03c8\u0303a + \u2202\u03be (\u03c8a \u2212 \u03c8\u0303a ), \u03c8\u0303b + (\u03c8b \u2212 \u03c8\u0303b )iL2\n= h\u2202\u03be (\u03c8a \u2212 \u03c8\u0303a ), \u03c8\u0303b iL2 + h\u2202\u03be (\u03c8a \u2212 \u03c8\u0303a ), (\u03c8b \u2212 \u03c8\u0303b )iL2 + h\u2202\u03be \u03c8\u0303a , (\u03c8b \u2212 \u03c8\u0303b )iL2 ,\nbecause h\u2202\u03be \u03c8\u0303a , \u03c8\u0303b iL2 = 0. The first term is bounded as t \u2192 0\u2212 because \u03c8a \u2212 \u03c8\u0303a = O(t).\nSimilarly, the second term is O(t), and the third term is bounded by\nk\u2202\u03be \u03c8\u0303a kL2 \u00d7 k\u03c8b \u2212 \u03c8\u0303b kL2 \u2264 C|t|\u22121 \u00d7 O(t)\nusing (4.44). Thus we obtain a bound\n|h\u2202\u03be \u03c8a , \u03c8b iL2 | \u2264 C\n\n(4.54)\n\non t \u2208 (\u2212\u01eb, 0) for some fixed C. Note that this bound might fail to hold in the cases\n\nk = 2, 3 due to the weaker estimates. Let T 0 be the matrix with entries h\u2202\u03be \u03c8a , \u03c8b iL2 .\nThen the gauge transformation\n\ng(t) = exp\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nT 0 (s) ds\n\nt\n\nsatisfies\ng(t) = 1 + O(t)\n\n(4.55)\n\nbecause T 0 is bounded, and maps \u03c81 , . . . , \u03c8k to a unitary parallel set of sections. We\nwill apply the gauge transformation later.\n127\n\n\fNext we consider the endomorphisms Tpj , j = 1, 2, 3. Extend \u03c81 , . . . , \u03c8k by mp\u22121\nfurther sections to form a gauge for Xp on t \u2208 (\u2212\u01eb, 0). In such a gauge the endomor-\n\nphisms are given by\n\n(Tpj )ab = hixj \u03c8a , \u03c8b iL2\n= hixj \u03c8\u0303a + ixj (\u03c8a \u2212 \u03c8\u0303a ), \u03c8\u0303b + (\u03c8b \u2212 \u03c8\u0303b )iL2\n=\n\n(Rpj )ab\n+ hixj \u03c8\u0303a , (\u03c8b \u2212 \u03c8\u0303b )iL2 \u2212 h(\u03c8a \u2212 \u03c8\u0303a ), ixj \u03c8b iL2\nt\n\n(4.56)\n\nusing equation (4.52). From (4.44), kixj \u03c8\u0303a kL2 = O(|t|\u22121 ) and so\n\u0001\nkixj \u03c8a kL2 = kixj 1 + O(t) \u03c8\u0303a kL2 = O(|t|\u22121 ).\n\nThus, estimating the RHS of (4.56) gives\n(Tpj )ab =\n\n(Rpj )ab\n+ Bj (t)\nt\n\n(4.57)\n\nwhere Bj is bounded as t \u2192 0\u2212 . Moreover, gauge transforming by g(t) into a parallel\n\ngauge does not alter the form of (4.57) because g(t) has the form (4.55). Nahm's equation implies that multiplying the map (4.49) by \u22122 gives an irreducible k-dimensional\n\nrepresentation of su(2), as in equation (3.2). This completes the proof when k > 3.\n\nFor the case k = 2 or 3 the analysis is very similar. Equation (4.54) becomes a\nbound |h\u2202\u03be \u03c8a , \u03c8b iL2 | = O(t\u22121/2 ), and the gauge transformation to the parallel gauge,\n\nequation (4.55), becomes g(t) = 1 + O(t1/2 ). Estimates on (4.56) give Tpj of the form\n(4.57) but with Bj (t) = O(t\u22121/2 ). Gauge transforming by g(t) does not alter the\nform of this expansion, and Nahm's equation fixes the constant for the irreducible\nrepresentation.\n\n\u2737\n\nWe leave monopoles at this point to prove an analogue of Proposition 4.50 for\ncalorons.\n\n4.4.3\n\nThe terminating component for calorons\n\nWe prove the following analogue of Proposition 4.50:\nProposition 4.58.

We\n\n1\ncan extend the framing from the boundary to the whole of S2\u03c0/\u03bc\n\u00d7 M , and apply the\n0\n\n\"3+ 1\" decomposition (4.6) to define A, \u03a6. However, up to O(r \u22122 ), A and \u03a6 are exactly\n\nthe same as a monopole configuration framed by A\u221e , \u03a6\u221e . Using (4.1) and (4.37) we\nhave\n\u2212\nDA,\u03be\n= \u2212\u2202x0 + DA \u2212 \u03a6 + i\u03be\n\n= \u2212\u2202x0 + D\u0303\u03be\u2217 + O(r \u22122 )\n\nwhere D\u0303\u03be\u2217 is the monopole model operator determined by A\u221e , \u03a6\u221e . Identifying the spin\n1\nbundles S \u00b1 of S2\u03c0/\u03bc\n\u00d7 M with S(3) and using the Fourier decomposition (4.30) gives\n0\n\u2212\nDA,\u03be\n|ZN = \u2212iN \u03bc0 + D\u0303\u03be\u2217 + O(r \u22122 ).\n\u2212\nWe therefore take the model operator for DA,\u03be\nto be \u2212iN \u03bc0 + D\u0303\u03be\u2217 on the N 'th Fourier\n\nmode.\n\nWorking near the singularity \u03be = \u03bcp the approximate solutions \u03c8\u0303j , j = 1, . . . , k,\n\u2212\n1\n\u03c8\u0303j = O(r \u22122 )\u03c8\u0303j together\ndefined in Section 4.4.1 pull-back to S2\u03c0/\u03bc\n\u00d7M and satisfy DA,\u03be\n0\n\nwith the analogue of the estimates (4.43). The proof of Lemma 4.45 goes through,\n+\n1\nreplacing D\u03be with DA,\u03be\nand taking \u03c9 \u2208 L2 (S2\u03c0/\u03bc\n\u00d7 R3 , S + \u2297 E), as does the proof of\n0\n\nCorollary 4.47. The proof of Proposition 4.50 then gives 4.58 directly.\n\n4.4.4\n\nThe continuing component and decomposition for kp 6= 0\n\nWe want to show that the continuing block of the Nahm data constructed from a\ncaloron is continuous across singularities with kp 6= 0, and obtain the full decomposition\n\nof the Nahm data at such a point, as described on page 50. While we also want to\nobtain the corresponding decomposition at zero jumps, this Section concentrates on\nthe case kp 6= 0 and we will only make some brief remarks about the zero jump case.\n\nAt present, obtaining the decomposition of monopole Nahm data at singularities via\nanalysis of the Dirac operator is an open problem (of course, Hurtubise-Murray obtained\nthe decomposition via spectral curves). It should be clear that if we could obtain the\n129\n\n\fdecomposition of the Nahm data constructed from a U (n) monopole-defining the\nNahm data via the coupled Dirac operator rather than via spectral curves-then the\ncaloron case would be very similar. For the remainder of this Section we therefore\nconcentrate on the simpler case of U (n) monopoles rather than calorons, although our\nconjectures and results will apply to calorons in an obvious way. Fix a U (n) Bogomolny\nmonopole (A, \u03a6) on a bundle E, framed by A\u221e , \u03a6\u221e and with boundary data (~k, ~\u03bc).\nLet D\u03be be the coupled Dirac operator defined by (1.28) and let {Xp , \u2207p , Tpj : p =\n\n1, . . . , n \u2212 1, j = 1, 2, 3} be the Nahm data defined in terms of D\u03be : Xp \u2192 (\u03bcp+1 , \u03bcp ) is\n\nthe bundle with fibre coker D\u03be while \u2207p and Tp1 , Tp2 , Tp3 are defined by (1.30) and (1.31).\n\nThe full claim we want to prove is:\n\nClaim 4.59. Let \u03bcp be a singularity with kp > 0 and let t = \u03be \u2212 \u03bcp . Then there is a\nparallel gauge on Xp\u22121 for some neighbourhood t \u2208 (0, \u01eb) in which the limits\nj,+\nj\nTp\u22121\n= lim Tp\u22121\n\n(4.60)\n\nt\u21920+\n\nj\nexist for j = 1, 2, 3, and Tp\u22121\n(t) is analytic.

The\nresidues Rpj define an irreducible representation of su(2).\n\nWorking with the fixed monopole (A, \u03a6), fix some \u03bcp with k := kp > 0 and let\nm := mp\u22121 . It is easy to show that away from the singularities {\u03bc1 , . . . , \u03bcn } solutions\n\nto Dp\u2217 decay at least as fast as exp(\u2212r|t|) as r \u2192 \u221e, by a calculation analogous to that\n\nin Section 4.2.3. On the other hand, the 'Nakajima solutions' \u03c8\u03031 , . . . , \u03c8\u0303k that determine\n\nthe terminating component at \u03bcp are of the form exp(\u2212r|t|) \u00d7 (non-L2 function). The\nfollowing conjecture is based on the idea that solutions in the continuing component\ndecay like exp(\u2212r|t + \u03b1|) across t = 0 for some \u03b1 6= 0, and are in some sense small\n\nin the eigenbundle with eigenvalue \u03bcp . Let \u03c81 , . . . , \u03c8k be the exact solutions defined\n\nby (4.53) that determine the terminating component.\nConjecture 1. There is an orthonormal set {\u03c8k+1 , . . . , \u03c8k+m } of maps\n\u03c8j : (\u2212\u01eb, \u01eb) \u2192 L2 (R3 , S(2) \u2297 E)\nsuch that for all j = k + 1, . . . , k + m:\n130\n\n\f1. \u03c8j (t) \u2208 coker D\u03be when t 6= 0,\n2. \u03c8j (t) is continuous in t\n3. for all t \u2208 (\u2212\u01eb, \u01eb), \u03c8j (t) vanishes to all orders of r in the limit r \u2192 \u221e, and\n4. for all i = 1, . . . , k and t \u2208 (\u2212\u01eb, 0), \u03c8i (t) is orthogonal to \u03c8j (t).\nIf Conjecture 1 holds, then using Proposition 4.50 the following Conjecture immediately holds:\nConjecture 2. There is a parallel gauge on Xp\u22121 for some neighbourhood t \u2208 (0, \u01eb)\n\nj,+\nin which the limits Tp\u22121\ndefined by (4.60) exist. There is also a parallel gauge on Xp\n\nfor some neighbourhood t \u2208 (\u2212\u01eb, 0) in which the T j decompose as in Proposition 4.50,\n\nj,+\nexcept the top left-hand block has the form Tp\u22121\n+ O(t).\n\nProof: Condition 3 of Conjecture 1 ensures that hixj \u03c8a , \u03c8b iL2 exists for all t \u2208 (\u2212\u01eb, \u01eb)\n\nand a, b \u2208 {k+1, . . . , k+m}, and is continuous in t. Moreover, transforming to a parallel\n\ngauge cannot introduce any discontinuities, because (fixing T 0 to be the matrix with\nR\nentries h\u2202\u03be \u03c8a , \u03c8b iL2 ) the gauge transformation exp T 0 ds will always be continuous,\neven if T 0 is discontinuous.\n\n\u2737\n\nWe can provide some evidence to support Conjecture 1. Recall the model operator\nD\u0303\u03be defined by (4.36). If Conjecture 1 does not hold for D\u0303\u03be (in some sense) then we\ncannot reasonably expect it to hold for D\u03be , so we should try to understand the behaviour\nof the solutions to D\u0303\u03be\u2217 near the singularity \u03bcp . First consider the component (D\u0303\u03bep )\u2217 of\nD\u0303\u03be\u2217 defined by equation (4.35). Consider a separable solution of the form\n\u0012\n\u0013\nf (r)u(y1 , y2 )\n\u03c8(r, y1 , y2 ) =\n.\ng(r)v(y1 , y2 )\nThis is a solution if\n\n\u0012\n\n(P + f )u + g(Da\u2212k v)\nf (Da+k u) + (P \u2212 g)v\n\n\u0013\n\n(4.61)\n\n=0\n\nwhere P + = i(r\u2202r + rt + (k + 2)/2) and P \u2212 = i(\u2212r\u2202r + rt + (k \u2212 2)/2). We therefore\n\nhave\n\n\u0012\n\n0\nDa+k\n\nDa\u2212k\n0\n\n\u0013\u0012 \u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\u0012 \u0013\nu\n\u03bb 0\nu\n=\nv\n0 \u03bc\nv\n\nfor some constants \u03bb, \u03bc, and\n\u0013\u0012 \u0013 \u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0012 \u0013\nf\n\u2212\u03bc 0\n0 P\u2212\nf\n=\n.\n+\nP\n0\ng\n0 \u2212\u03bb\ng\n\n(4.62)\n\nIt follows that\nDa\u2212k Da+k u = \u03bb\u03bcu,\n\nDa+k Da\u2212k v = \u03bb\u03bcv,\n\nP \u2212 P + f = \u03bb\u03bcf,\n\nP + P \u2212 g = \u03bb\u03bcg.\n131\n\nand\n\n(4.63)\n(4.64)\n\n\fThe values \u03b1 = \u03bb\u03bc are fixed by the spectrum of the operator Da\u2212k Da+k , which has a\ncomplete set of orthogonal eigenvectors. Given any non-zero \u03bb, \u03bc, equation (4.62) can\nbe solved explicitly using Maple: the solutions are Whittaker functions with argument\nz = 2rt (see [1, Section 13] for a description of Whittaker functions and their asymptotic\nexpansions). In the limit r \u2192 \u221e these have the form\n\u0001\n\u0001\nexp(\u2212rt) \u00d7 1 + lower order terms\n\nfor t < 0, and so are not normalizable. However, when \u03bb = \u03bc = 0 the equations decouple\nand normalizable solutions for g exist-but these are just the Nakajima solutions. By\ncompleteness of the eigenfunctions in (4.63) and (4.64) we can assume that any solution\nto (D\u0303\u03bep )\u2217 is a sum of terms of the form (4.61), and by orthogonality (D\u0303\u03bep )\u2217 must kill\neach term in the sum. Thus we have shown that the only normalizable solutions to\n(D\u0303\u03bep )\u2217 on t \u2208 (\u2212\u01eb, 0) are the Nakajima solutions. This analysis can be repeated for\nthe other components (D\u0303\u03beq )\u2217 (q 6= p) of D\u0303\u03be\u2217 , and shows that their solutions decay like\n\nexp(\u2212r|\u03be \u2212 \u03bcq |) as r \u2192 \u221e. These solutions therefore form continuous families across\n\nt = 0 which satisfy the conditions of Conjecture 1.\n\nWhile this supports Conjecture 1, it certainly does not prove it. Given a family of\nsolutions \u03c8\u0303(t) to D\u0303\u03be\u2217 that is continuous across t = 0, one might hope to use \u03c8\u0303 as an\napproximate solution, as we did for the terminating component, and show that \u03c8 = P\u0302 \u03c8\u0303\nis a continuous family of solutions to D\u03be\u2217 . However, since \u03c8\u0303(t) decays like exp(\u2212r|t + \u03bc|)\nfor some \u03bc 6= 0 the estimates (4.43) do not hold, and we do not obtain (1 \u2212 P\u0302 )\u03c8\u0303 \u2192 0\nas t \u2192 0. Nakajima's analysis is therefore insufficient to prove that the family P\u0302 \u03c8\u0303(t) is\n\ncontinuous across t = 0. In any case, there may be the wrong number of solutions to\nD\u0303\u03be\u2217 to match the expected rank of the continuing component.\nAn obvious approach to proving Conjecture 1 is to use weighted operators, like\n\nthose in Section 4.2.3, using the weighting to kill off the solutions corresponding to the\nterminating component. Consider the operators\nL\u03be,\u03bb = w\u03bb D\u03be w\u03bb\u22121\n\nand L\u2217\u03be,\u03bb = w\u03bb\u22121 D\u03be\u2217 w\u03bb\n\nwhere w\u03bb is defined by (4.19). If we take \u03bb to be some small positive constant then,\ngiven the Nakajima solutions \u03c81 , . . . , \u03c8k of D\u03be\u2217 , w\u03bb\u22121 \u03c81 , . . . , w\u03bb\u22121 \u03c8k are solutions to L\u2217\u03be,\u03bb\nbut are not L2 . In other words, by weighting we have removed the Nakajima solutions\nfrom the L2 -kernel. If we could prove that L\u2217\u03be,\u03bb was Fredholm with L2 -index m for\nt \u2208 (\u2212\u01eb, \u01eb), then a trivialization \u03c8k+1 (t), . . . , \u03c8k+m (t) of the L2 kernel of L\u2217\u03be,\u03bb would give\nrise to a set of solutions to D\u03be\u2217 satisfying the properties in Conjecture 1. Unfortunately,\n\na calculation of the indicial family like that in Section 4.2.3 shows that L\u2217\u03be,\u03bb is not\nFredholm when t \u2208 (\u2212\u03bb, \u03bb), and so the strategy fails to work.\n\nObtaining the continuing component at a zero jump presents further difficulties, and\n\nwe will not be so bold as to make a formal conjecture as we did for kp 6= 0. Given a zero\n132\n\n\fjump \u03bcp , we would not expect to find families \u03c81 (t), . . . , \u03c8m (t) defined on t \u2208 (\u2212\u01eb, \u01eb)\n\nsatisfying conditions 1, 2, and 3 of the Conjecture, since the Nahm matrices would\nthen be continuous across the zero jump. One possibility is that there are families\n\u03c81 (t), . . . , \u03c8m (t) defined on t \u2208 (\u2212\u01eb, \u01eb) satisfying conditions 1 and 2 but not 3. This\n\nwould imply that the matrices (T j )ab = hixj \u03c8a , \u03c8b iL2 do not exist at t = 0 (because\n\nxj \u03c8a might fail to be L2 ), while the limits as t \u2192 0 from either side could exist but be\n\ndifferent. Beyond this remark we will not consider zero jumps further.\n\nThe final step is to go from Conjecture 1 and Proposition 4.50 to the full decomposition 4.59. We make the following:\nConjecture 3. Given that the data \u2207p , Tp1 , Tp2 , Tp3 satisfy Nahm's equation on the\ninterior of each interval Ip , we obtain the full decomposition 4.59 from Conjecture 2.\nConjecture 3 follows immediately from:\nConjecture 4. Suppose we have a rank (m + k) solution \u2207, T 1 , T 2 , T 3 to Nahm's\n\nequation on a bundle over the interval t \u2208 (0, \u01eb), where m, k \u2265 0. In addition, suppose\nthere is a parallel gauge in which the T j decompose as\n\u271b\n\nT j (t) =\n\nm\n\n\u2732\u271b\n\nS j + O(t)\n\n\u2732\n\nk\n\u2217\nAj (t)\n\n\u2217\n\nwhere S j is some fixed skew-hermitian matrix and\n\uf8f1\nj\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2R /t + O(1)\nAj (t) = Rj /t + O(t\u22121/2 )\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\ncould be unbounded\n\n!\n\n\u273bm\n\u2744\n\u273b\n\u2744k\n\nAj satisfies\nwhen k > 3\nwhen k = 2 or 3\nwhen k = 1\n\nas t \u2192 0. Here R1 , R2 , R3 define an irreducible representation of su(2) in the usual\nway. Under these assumptions it necessarily follows that\n\n1. the top left-hand block is analytic in t, even for k = 0,\n2. the off-diagonal blocks are of the form t(k\u22121)/2 \u00d7 analytic function, and\n3. Aj (t) is meromorphic when k > 1 but holomorphic when k = 1.\nConjecture 4 should be relatively easy to prove, and elements of a proof already exist\nin the literature: [19, Section 2] contains related results. The main assertion contained\nin the Conjecture is that when k = 2, 3 and Aj (t) = Rj /t + O(t\u22121/2 ), Nahm's equation\nforces Aj (t) to have the form Rj /t + O(1). This is more straight-forward to prove when\n133\n\n\fm = 0, according to the following outline. Suppose that the matrices T 1 , T 2 , T 3 have\nrank k = 2 or k = 3, solve Nahm's equation (with \u2207 = \u2202t ) on (0, \u01eb), and have the form\nTj =\nIt follows that\n\nRj\nQj\n+ 1/2 + higher order terms.\nt\nt\n\n1\n\u2212 Q1 + R 2 Q3 + Q2 R 3 \u2212 R 3 Q2 \u2212 Q3 R 2 = 0\n2\n\n(4.65)\n\nand the two equations obtained from cyclic permutations of {1, 2, 3}. In the case k = 2\nP\nwe can express each Qj as a sum 30 Qjl \u03b3l and assume Rj = \u2212 21 \u03b3j for j = 1, 2, 3.\nSubstituting this into (4.65) and the other two equations, it is easy to show that Qjl = 0\n\nfor all j, l. A similar proof using more sophisticated representation theory should work\nfor the case m = 0, k = 3. However, when m > 0 the off-diagonal blocks make the\nConjecture harder to prove.\nTo conclude this Section we return to calorons to give a precise statement of our\nresults concerning the transform from calorons to Nahm data. Our aim was to prove\nthat the Nahm transform is a well-defined map from C \u2217 (k0 , ~k, \u03bc0 , \u03bc\n~ ) to N \u2217 (k0 , ~k, \u03bc0 , ~\u03bc).\n\nWe have proved that the transform of an element of C \u2217 (k0 , ~k, \u03bc0 , ~\u03bc) consists of a well-\n\ndefined connection and endomorphisms {\u2207p , Tp1 , Tp2 , Tp3 } on bundles Xp \u2192 (\u03bcp+1 , \u03bcp ) \u2282\n\nR/\u03bc0 Z for each p = 1, . . . , n; that the data satisfy Nahm's equation; and that the data\nhas the correct rank to be an element of N \u2217 (k0 , ~k, \u03bc0 , ~\u03bc). To complete the proof we must\n\nalso obtain the decomposition of the Nahm data at each point \u03be = \u03bcp and prove that\nthe Nahm operator constructed from the Nahm data is injective (since N \u2217 (k0 , ~k, \u03bc0 , ~\n\u03bc)\nis by definition the set of caloron Nahm data that determine injective Nahm operators).\nWe have not addressed the problem of injectivity, but made some remarks about this\nin Section 1.4. Although the Conjectures above are stated for U (n) monopoles they\nalso apply to calorons in an obvious way, and assuming they hold, we have obtained\nthe correct decomposition of the caloron Nahm data at singularities with kp 6= 0. We\n\nrefer the reader back to Section 1.4 for remarks about the invertibility of the transform\nand problems that could be tackled with the Nahm transform in place.\n\n134\n\n\fGlossary of
