The existence of the local moments is taken from the outset and their values are determined through\nvariational principle by minimizing the corresponding ground state energy. The method is used to solve the dynamical mean-field equations for the multi-orbital Hubbard model.

The DMFT is a self\u2013\nconsistent method, where in each iteration loop the\nKondo problem is solved numerically. The application\nof the DMFT to investigate real systems, in particular\nwith many orbitals, is difficult because of the necessity to solve the Kondo problem for arbitrary parameters. Numerically exact methods, like numerical renormalization group [2] or determinant quantum Monte\nCarlo [3] are very time (CPU) consuming, in particular\nwhen the number of orbitals is large. Reliable analytical methods are therefore needed. One of such methods, which recovers Luttinger property and Kondo exponential scale as well as Hubbard satellites has been\nrecently invented by Logan et al. [4] and named a local\nmoment approach (LMA). In this contribution we gen\u2217 Corresponding author.\nTel:+48 (22) 5532315 fax: +48 (22) 6219 475\nEmail address: anna.kauch@fuw.edu.pl (A.

Within the DMFT framework\nsupplemented with the LMA we analyze the problem\nof Mott\u2013Hubbard metal\u2013insulator transition (MIT) in\norbitally degenerate and non\u2013degenerate systems.\nWe start with the generalization of the LMA to\nsolve the single impurity Anderson model (SIAM)\nwith many orbital levels:\nX\n(\u01eb\u03b1 \u2212 U\u03b1 n\u03b1,\u03c3\u0304 ) n\u03b1,\u03c3 +\nHSIAM =\n\u03b1,\u03c3\n\nXX\n\n\u03c3,\u03c3 \u2032 \u03b16=\u03b2\n\nX\n\nk,\u03c3,\u03b1\n\n\u0001\n\u2032\nU\u03b1\u03b2\n\u2212 J\u03b4\u03c3\u03c3 \u2032 n\u03b1\u03c3 n\u03b2\u03c3 \u2032 +\n\n(1)\n\n\u0010\n\u0011 X\nVk\u03b1 d\u2020\u03b1\u03c3 ck\u03c3 + c\u2020k\u03c3 d\u03b1\u03c3 +\n\u01ebk c\u2020k\u03c3 ck\u03c3 ,\nk,\u03c3\n\nwhere the direct U and U \u2032 as well as exchange J interactions between electrons of spin \u03c3 and on orbitals \u03b1\nor \u03b2 are taken into account.\nIn the unrestricted Hartree\u2013Fock approximation to\nHF\nthe SIAM the local Green functions G\u03b1\u03b2\n\u03c3 (\u03bc\u03b1 , \u03bc\u03b2 ; \u03c9)\ndepend explicitly on the local magnetic moments \u03bc\u03b1\non each orbital. These local Green functions are used\nin the random phase approximation (RPA) to determine the polarization diagrams \u03a0\u03b1\u03b2\n\u03c3 \u03c3\u0304 (\u03bc\u03b1 , \u03bc\u03b2 ; \u03c9), cor20 July 2018\n\n\fresponding to spin flip processes, and hence the self\u2013\nenergies \u03a3\u03b1\u03b2\n\u03c3 (\u03bc\u03b1 , \u03bc\u03b2 ; \u03c9). The Green functions calculated in this way depend now on the local moments\n\u03bc\u03b1 . However, in a single impurity problem the spinrotational symmetry cannot be spontaneously broken.\nTo restore this symmetry within the approximate solutionP\nwe use symmetrized Green functions G\u03b1\u03b2\n\u03c3 (\u03c9) =\n\u03b1\u03b2\n1\nG\n(\u03bc\n,\n\u03bc\n;\n\u03c9),\nwhere\n\u00b1|\u03bc\n\u03b1\n\u03b1 | in the\n\u03b2\n\u03c3\n\u00b1|\u03bc\u03b1 |,\u00b1|\u03bc\u03b2 |\n2Norb\nsum means summation over different directions of local orbital moments and Norb is the number of orbitals.\nIn this method the existence of the local moments is\nassumed from the beginning.\nThe lengths of the local moments |\u03bc\u03b1 | and the number of particles on each orbital n\u03b1 are determined\nby minimizing the ground state energy function, i.e.\nEphysical = min{\u03bc\u03b1 ,n\u03b1 } E(\u03bc\u03b1 , n\u03b1 ). In this work we also\nadjust the Fermi energy of the electrons in the impurity atom to have the proper total number of electrons.\nThis generalized LMA is used\nP toPsolve \u03b1multi-orbital\n\u2020\nHubbard model HHubb =\nij\n\u03b1,\u03c3 tij di\u03b1\u03c3 dj\u03b1\u03c3 +\nHlocal , where the local part is a sum over all lattice site\nterms which are of the same form as the atomic part\nin the SIAM. This model is solved within the DMFT\nwhere the self\u2013consistency condition relates the local\nmatrix Green functions with the matrix of the self\u2013\nenergies [3]. This condition simplifies for the Bethe\nlattice that is used in this contribution. The band\nwidth W\u03b1 = 2 for each orbital \u03b1 sets the energy units.\nIn Fig. 1 the spectral functions for two\u2013orbital Hubbard model are shown for degenerate case \u01ebA = \u01ebB (upper panel) and for nondegenerate (asymmetric) case\n|\u01ebA \u2212 \u01ebB | = 0.3 (lower panel). Also the cases with (J =\nU/4) and without (J = 0) Hund exchange coupling are\ncompared. The inter-band interaction U \u2032 = U \u2212 2J is\nfixed preserving SU (4) symmetry. In all cases the average number of electrons is fixed to ne = 2 per lattice\nsite.\nIn the first case \u01ebA = \u01ebB when U is sufficiently large\nthe correlation gap is opened and the system is a Mott\ninsulator. At smaller U , when the system is on the\nmetallic side, the Kondo\u2013like peak is seen at J = 0 and\nis destroyed at J > 0. When the orbital degeneracy\nis removed, as in |\u01ebA \u2212 \u01ebB | = 0.3 case, the system for\na given U is metallic on one of the orbitals, whereas\non the other it is insulating. The number of electrons\nper site on each orbital level is no longer equal and\nthe spectral functions on different orbitals begin to differ qualitatively. At larger U the system is insulating\nin both orbitals. So we find an orbital selective MottHubbard MIT in asymmetric case. Increasing further\nthe difference |\u01ebA \u2212 \u01ebB | would lead to the appearance\nof the band insulator possessing a gap between bands.\nInitially the orbital selective Mott-Hubbard MIT was\nfound in a two-orbital symmetric case, where orbitals\nhad the same energies but different bandwidths [5,6,7].\n\n2\n\nSpectral\n\nfunction\n\n1,5\n1\n0,5\n0\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n0,3\n0,2\n0,1\n0\n-4\n\nEnergy\nFig. 1.

Lower panel: nondegenerate case with\n|\u01ebA \u2212 \u01ebB | = 0.3, U = 1.8 and J = U/4; solid and dashed lines\ncorrespond to different orbitals. In both cases the Fermi level\nis at zero energy\n\nThe present contribution extends this investigation on\na case where this orbital degeneracy is removed. The\ncrystal level splitting can be tuned in some extend by\nthe axial pressure and thereby there is a practical opportunity to search experimentally for the orbital selective MIT.\nThe generalized LMA to multi\u2013orbital SIAM allows\nus to efficiently study the correlated electron systems\nwithin DMFT. In particular it is relatively easy to address the problems where the degeneracy of orbital\nlevels is removed, and hence the Fermi energy has to\nbe determined self\u2013consistently in each iteration loop.\nAlso the local moment approach is much more efficient\nin studying problems with more then two orbitals [8].\nThis regime is hardly accessible in numerically exact\napproaches.\nThis work is supported by Polish Committee of Scientific Research through grant KBN-2 P03B 08 224.\nPartial support of the Sonderforschungsbereich 484 of\nthe Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) is also\nacknowledged.\n\nReferences\n[1] G.
