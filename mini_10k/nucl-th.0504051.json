The predicted asymmetry\nA are also compared with the Parton Model predictions for future experimental investigations of\nQuark-Hadron Duality.\nPACS numbers: 12.15.Ji, 13.60.Le, 25.30.-c\n\n1\n\n\fI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nIn recent years, a dynamical model had been developed[1, 2] to investigate electromagnetic pion production reactions in the region near the \u2206(1232) resonance. The model was\nsubsequently extended[3] to also investigate neutrino-induced reactions (\u03bd\u03bc , \u03bc\u2212 \u03c0). Fairly\nconsistent descriptions of all of the available data in the \u2206 region have been obtained. In\nthis work, we further extend this model (called the SL model ) to address two questions of\ncurrent interest : (1) Will Hadron-Quark Duality first observed by Bloom and Gilman[4] in\ninclusive p(e, e\u2032 ) be also seen in the neutrino-induced N(\u03bd, e) and N(\u03bd, \u03bd \u2032 ) reactions ? (2)\nHow can parity violating asymmetry of inclusive N(~e, e) reaction be used to improve our\nknowledge about the axial N-\u2206 form factor ? Experimental data for testing our predictions\ncan be obtained at new neutrino facilities[5] and Jefferson Laboratory (JLab)[6, 7].\nOur first step is to construct neutral currents within the SL model. This then allows us to\nextend our previous calculations[3] of N(\u03bd\u03bc , \u03bc\u2212 \u03c0) reactions to also predict N(\u03bd, \u03bd \u2032 \u03c0) reactions\nfor examining some questions concerning the Quark-Hadron Duality. Simply speaking, an\ninclusive lepton scattering observable exhibits Quark-Hadron Duality when an average of\nthis quantity over an appropriately chosen scaling variable in the resonance region is close\nto that in the Deeply Inelastic Scattering (DIS) region. More details on this subject can be\nfound in a recent review by Melnitchouk, Ent and Keppel[8]. The Quark-Hadron Duality\nwas first observed[4] for the p(e, e\u2032 ) structure function F2 = \u03c9W2 . Recent experimental\ndata[9, 10] for both F2 and F1 = mN W1 have further confirmed more quantitatively this\ninteresting observation. Theoretical attempts in understanding the Quark-Hadron Duality\nwithin QCD were already made[11, 12, 13] in 1970's. More recent works are reported in,\nfor example, Refs.[14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]. Within the Standard model[20], it is natural to\nask whether the Quark-Hadron Duality should also exist in the neutrino-induced N(\u03bd, e)\nand N(\u03bd, \u03bd \u2032 ) reactions (from nowon, \u03bd and e denote the neutrinos and charged leptons,\nrespectively, of any generation within the Standard Model). In the absence of necessary\nneutrino data, this can be explored theoretically in the \u2206 region using the extended SL\nmodel presented in this paper. Obviously, we can only explore the 'local' Quark-Hadron\nDuality in the \u2206 region.\nWe will also report on our investigations of the spin dependent structure functions g1 and\ng2 of (e, e\u2032 ) processes. To see the accuracy of our model in predicting these quantities, we\nfirst show that some recent data[21, 22] of the polarization observables associated with the\nexclusive p(~e, e\u2032 \u03c0) and p~(~e, e\u2032 \u03c0) reactions agree well with the predictions from the considered\nSL model. We then find that g1 calculated from our model agree reasonably well with\nthe recent data[23], but do not show Quark-Hadron Duality when compared with the DIS\ndata[24]. The calculated g2 is also found to be rather different from the DIS data which can\nbe described reasonably well by the Wandzura-Wilczek formula[25].\nOur second task in this work is to apply the extended SL model to address some questions\nconcerning the N-\u2206 form factors. It has been well recognized that these form factors are\nimportant information for testing current hadron models and also lattice QCD calculations\nin the near future. The vector parts of the N-\u2206 form factors in the Q2 \u2264 4 (GeV/c)2\nregion have been rather well determined by analyzing very extensive high precision data of\nelectromagnetic pion production reactions, as reviewed in Ref.[26]. On the other hand, the\naxial vector N-\u2206 form factor is not well determined mainly because of the short of high\nprecision data of neutrino-induced pion production reactions in the \u2206 region. For example,\nthe axial N-\u2206 from factor determined in Ref.[3] is rather different from the one determined\n2\n\n\fpreviously[27]. This leads to uncertainties in interpreting the axial N-\u2206 form factor in terms\nof the hadron structure calculations such as those reported in Refs.[28, 29, 30, 31]. The\nsituation will be improved when the data from new neutrino facilities become available in\nthe near future. Alternatively, progress can be made by following Refs.[32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37,\n38, 39, 40] to investigate the parity violating asymmetry of inclusive N(~e, e\u2032 ) reactions. This\npolarization observable is due to the interference between the electromagnetic currents and\nneutral currents and hence can be used to explore the axial N-\u2206 form factor. Experimental\neffort in this direction is being made[6] at JLab. To facilitate this study, we have applied the\nextended SL model to explore the dependence of the parity violating asymmetry of N(~e, e\u2032 )\non the axial N-\u2206 form factor.\nIn section II, we will specify the considered models of electromagnetic currents (em),\nweak charged currents (cc), and weak neutral currents (nc). We first recall their forms in\nthe Standard model[20] and then specify how such currents are defined in terms of hadronic\ndegrees of freedom of the SL model. In section III, we give expressions of the inclusive cross\nsections and indicate how the structure functions are calculated within our hadronic model\nand Parton Model. Section IV is devoted to present results for studying the Quark-Hadron\nDuality in the \u2206 region. The predicted N(e, e\u2032 ) structure functions will also be compared\nwith the recent data. The results for the parity violating asymmetry of the inclusive N(~e, e\u2032 )\nwill be given in section V. A summary is given in section VI.\nII.\n\nMODELS OF ELECTROWEAK CURRENTS\n\nWe first recall the electroweak currents defined in the Standard Model[20]. In the considered \u2206 excitation region, we can eliminate heavy W and Z bosons and keep interactions\ninvolving only up (u) and down (d) quarks.

However, they can not be used directly for investigating meson production reactions in the resonance region where the perturbative QCD is not applicable. At\nthe present time, the most tractable ways for investigating these reactions are in terms of\nhadronic degrees of freedom. The starting point is a hadronic effective Lagrangian constrained by the symmetry properties of the Standard Model. Accordingly, the resulting\nelectroweak currents have the forms of Eqs.(5)-(8), but are written in terms of hadronic\nfield operators. This can be achieved by using the standard effective chiral lagrangian\nmethods[20, 42, 43]. In the SL model developed in Refs.[1, 2, 3], the constructed electroweak currents are expressed in terms of the field operators of the nucleon (N), Delta (\u2206),\npion (~\u03c0 ), omega meson (\u03c9), and rho meson (~\u03c1). They can be written as\n\u03baV \u03bc\u03bd\n~\u03c4\ngA\nV~ \u03bc * ~v\u03bc = N\u0304[\u03b3 \u03bc~v\u03bc \u2212\nN\u0304\u03b3 \u03bc \u03b35 [~v\u03bc * ~\u03c4 ]N \u00d7 ~\u03c0\n\u03c3 \u2202\u03bd ~v\u03bc ] * N +\n2mN\n2\n2F\ng\u03c9\u03c0V\n \u0304 \u03bc T~ * ~v\u03bd \u0393\u03bc\u03bd N ,\n+[~\u03c0 \u00d7 \u2202 \u03bc~\u03c0 ] * ~v\u03bc \u2212\n\u01eb\u03b1\u03bc\u03bd\u03b4 [\u2202 \u03b1~v \u03bc ] * ~\u03c0 [\u2202 \u03bd \u03c9 \u03b4 ] \u2212 i\u2206\nV\nm\u03c0\n~ \u03bc * ~v\u03bc = gA N\u0304\u03b3 \u03bc \u03b35 ~\u03c4 * ~v\u03bc N \u2212 F \u2202 \u03bc~\u03c0 * ~v\u03bc \u2212 f\u03c1\u03c0A (~\u03c1\u03bc \u00d7 ~\u03c0) * ~v\u03bc + \u2206\n \u0304 \u03bd T~ * ~v\u03bc \u0393\u03bc\u03bd N ,\nA\nA\n2\n\n(12)\n(13)\n\nwhere ~v\u03bc is an arbitrary isovector function, F = 93 MeV is the pion decay constant, and\ngA = 1.26 is the axial coupling strength of the nucleon. The other parameters as well as the\nvertex \u0393\u03bc\u03bd\nA,V and isospin operator T of the N-\u2206 transition are given in Refs.[1, 2, 3]. With\n\u03bc\nthe electromagnetic current jem\ngiven explicitly in Ref.[1], the relation Eq.(5) and Eq.(12)\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\ncan be used to get Visoscalar and hence jnc\nof Eq.(8) is also completely determined within the\n\u03bc\nSL model. The neutral current jnc is needed to extend the calculations of Refs.[1, 2, 3] to\nalso study (\u03bd, \u03bd \u2032 \u03c0) reactions and the parity violating asymmetry of the (~e, e\u2032 ) reaction.\nThe electroweak currents defined by Eqs.(5)-(8) and (12)-(13) must be supplemented by\nadditional effective Lagrangians describing the haronic interactions, such as \u03c0NN, \u03c0N\u2206,\n\u03c1NN, \u03c1\u03c0\u03c0, and \u03c9NN couplings, to calculate the meson production amplitudes within the\nSL model. The details of such a dynamical approach have been given in Refs.[1, 2, 3]. Here\nit is sufficient to just illustrate schematically the basic meson production mechanisms of the\nSL model. In Fig.1, we show the constructed non-resonant pion production mechanisms.\nFor the em current contributions, the waved-line is photon and all diagrams contribute. For\n4\n\n\fcc and nc current contributions, the wave-line is the vector current V or axial vector current\nA. Like the em case, all terms in Fig.1 contribute to nc amplitude but with different isospin\nweighting factors defined by Eqs.(5) and (8). For the cc contributions, all terms contribute\nto the amplitudes induced by the vector current V except that the \u03c1 exchange in (c) should\nbe excluded because it is an isoscalar interaction. The cc's amplitude due to axial vector\ncurrent A contains only mechanisms (a), (b), (e) with only \u03c1 exchange, and (f). In both cc\nand nc cases, the pion pole term due to the second term \u2212F \u2202 \u03bc~\u03c0 * ~v\u03bc of axial current Eq.(13)\nhas additional contributions, as explained in Ref.[3].\nThe \u2206 excitation mechanism is illustrated in Fig.2. For the later discussions in this\npaper, here we recall that the matrix element of the axial N-\u2206 coupling \u0393\u03bc\u03bd\nA in Eq.(13) can\nbe written as\nd2 (q 2 )\nP\u03b1 (q \u03b1 g \u03bc\u03bd \u2212 g \u03b1\u03bc q \u03bd )\nm2N\nd3 (q 2 )\nd4 (q 2 )\n\u2212 2 q \u03bc p\u03bdN \u2212 i 2 \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 P\u03b1 q\u03b2 \u03b35 ,\nmN\nmN\n\n2 \u03bc\u03bd\n< p\u2206 | \u0393\u03bc\u03bd\n+\nA | pN > = d1 (q )g\n\n(14)\n\nwhere p\u2206 and pN are the momenta of the \u2206 and N, respectively, q = p\u2206 \u2212 pN , and P =\n(p\u2206 + pN ). The strengths of the form factors at Q2 = \u2212q 2 = 0 are identified with the quark\nmodel predictions[28] and are found to be di (0) = Di \u221a625 gA with gA = 1.26, D1 = 0.969,\nD2 = \u22120.180, D3 = 0.836, and d4 = 0. In Ref.[3], it was found that all of the available data\nof N(\u03bd\u03bc , \u03bc\u2212 \u03c0) data in the \u2206 region can be well described if the q 2 -dependence of each form\nfactor in Eq.(14) is taken to be (Q2 = \u2212q 2 )\n2\nd1,2 (Q2 ) = d1,2 (0)GA\nN,\u2206 (Q ) ,\n\nd3 (Q2 ) = d3 (0)\n\nm2N\nGA (Q2 ) ,\nQ2 + m2\u03c0 N,\u2206\n\nwith\n2\n2\n2\n2\nGA\nN,\u2206 (Q ) = (1 + aQ )exp(\u2212bQ )GA (Q ) ,\n\n(15)\n\nwhere a = 0.154 (GeV/c)\u22122 , b = 0.166 (GeV/c)2 , and GA (Q2 ) = 1/(1 + Q2 /MA2 )2 with\nMA = 1.02 GeV is the nucleon axial form factor[44]. The corresponding vector form factor\nGV\u2206,N (Q2 ), which is associated with \u0393\u03bc\u03bd\nV of Eq.(12) and has been well determined[1, 2] by\nanalyzing the data of pion electroproduction, has the same form as Eq.(15) except that\nGA (Q2 ) is replaced by the usual proton form factor Gp (Q2 ) = 1/(1+Q2 /\u039b2p )2 with \u039b2p = 0.71\n(GeV/c)2 .\nWe further mention that the electroweak pion production amplitudes (denoted as J from\nnowon) calculated within the SL model can be written schematically in the center of mass\n(c.m.) frame of the final \u03c0N system as\n(n.r.)\n\nJ\u03c0N,aN (k, q, W ) = J\u03c0N,aN (k, q, W ) +\n\n\u0393\u0304\u2020\u2206,\u03c0N (k, W )\u0393\u0304\u2206,aN (q, W )\n,\nW \u2212 m\u2206 \u2212 \u03a3(W )\n\n(16)\n\nwhere a = \u03b3, W or Z bosons, q and k are the relevant initial and final momenta, \u03a3(W ) is\n(n.r.)\nthe \u2206 self-energy. The non-resonant amplitudes J\u03c0N,aN (k, q, W ) are calculated from\n(n.r.)\n\nJ\u03c0N,aN (k, q, W ) = v\u03c0N,aN + t\u03c0N,\u03c0N G\u03c0N (W )v\u03c0N,aN ,\n5\n\n(17)\n\n\fwhere v\u03c0N,aN are the non-resonant amplitudes illustrated in Fig.1, t\u03c0N,\u03c0N is the non-resonant\n\u03c0N scattering amplitude, and G\u03c0N (W ) is the \u03c0N propagator. Note that the second term\nof Eq.(17) is the consequence of the unitarity condition. This is neglected in the previous\ninvestigations[35, 38, 39, 40] of the effects due to the non-resonant amplitudes on the parity violating asymmetry of N(~e, e\u2032 ) reaction. Furthermore, the non-resonant mechanisms\nconsidered in those works also differ from what are illustrated in Fig.1 and well tested in\nextensive investigations of exclusive N(\u03b3, \u03c0), N(e, e\u2032 \u03c0), and N(\u03bd\u03bc , \u03bc\u2212 \u03c0) reactions. For example, the vector meson exchanges are not included in Refs.[38, 39] and pseudo-scalar \u03c0NN\ncoupling, instead of the pseudo-vector coupling used in the SL model, is used in Ref.[40].\nThe resonant term in Eq.(16) is defined by the dressed vertices which contain the influence\nof the non-resonant interactions as given by the following equation\n\u0393\u0304\u2206,aN (q, W ) = \u0393\u2206,aN (q) +\n\nZ\n\n(n.r.)\n\ndk\u0393\u2206,\u03c0N (k)G\u03c0N (k, W )J\u03c0N,aN (k, q, W ) ,\n\n(18)\n\nwhere \u0393\u2206,aN (q) is the bare N-\u2206 form factor. The second term in Eq.(18) is commonly called\nthe meson cloud contributions to the N-\u2206 transition. Explicit calculations of these meson\ncloud effects also mark an important difference between this work and all of the previous\ninvestigations[32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40] of parity violating asymmetry of N(~e, e\u2032 )\nreactions. We emphasize that Eqs.(16)-(18) satisfy the unitarity condition which is essential\nin interpreting the meson production data, as explained in Refs.[1, 2, 3] as well as in many\nworks reviewed in Ref.[26].\nIII.\n\nCALCULATIONS OF STRUCTURE FUNCTIONS\n\nWith the Lagrangian Eq.(1), the formula for calculating the exclusive cross sections for\n(e, e\u2032 \u03c0) and (\u03bd, e\u03c0) processes are given in details in Refs.[1, 2, 3]. The formula for calculating\n(\u03bd, \u03bd \u2032 \u03c0) cross sections can be easily obtained from Ref.[3] with minor modifications. In this\npaper, we focus on inclusive processes. Their cross sections can be more simply written in\nterms of structure functions.\nFollowing Ref.[41], the symmetry properties require that the lepton scattering structure\nfunctions W1 , W2 and W3 are in general related to the hadron tensor W \u03bc\u03bd by\nW \u03bc\u03bd = \u2212W1 g \u03bc\u03bd +\n\nW2 \u03bc \u03bd\nW3\np p + i 2 \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 p\u03b1 q\u03b2 ,\n2\nmN\n2mN\n\n(19)\n\nwhere the convention \u01eb0123 = \u22121 is chosen. The structure functions are functions of\u221atwo\nindependent\ninvariant variables. One usually chooses Q2 and the invariant mass W = s =\nq\n(p + q)2 in the resonance region, but chooses Bjorken scaling variable x = Q2 /(2p * q) and\nQ2 in the deeply inelastic region. Here q and p are the momenta of the exchanged boson\n(\u03b3, W or Z) and the initial nucleon, respectively. The unpolarized inclusive N(e, e\u2032 ) cross\nsections can then be written as\nd\u03c3\n4\u03b12 E \u20322\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\n=\n[2W1 sin2 + W2 cos2 ] ,\n\u2032\n4\nd\u03a9dE\nQ\n2\n2\n\n(20)\n\nwith\nQ2 = \u2212q 2 = 4EE \u2032 sin2\n6\n\n\u03b8\n,\n2\n\n(21)\n\n\fwhere E and E \u2032 are the incident and outgoing lepton energies, respectively, \u03b8 is the lepton scattering angle with respect to the incident lepton . For inclusive (\u03bd, e\u2212 ) and (\u03bd\u0304, e+ )\nprocesses, we have\nd\u03c3 \u03bd,\u03bd\u0304\nG2F | Vud |2 \u20322\nE + E\u2032\n\u03b8\n2 \u03b8\n2 \u03b8\n=\nE\n[2W\nsin\n+\nW\ncos\n\u00b1\nW\nsin2 ] ,\n1\n2\n3\n\u2032\n\u2032\n2\ndE d\u03a9\n2\u03c0\n2\n2\nmN\n2\n\n(22)\n\nwhere the sign in front of W3 is + (-) for (\u03bd, e\u2212 ) ((\u03bd\u0304, e+ )). For (\u03bd, \u03bd \u2032 ), the cross section\nformula is the same as Eq.(22) except that the factor | Vud |2 is removed.\nWithin the hadronic models, such as the SL model considered in this paper, the hadron\ntensor W \u03bc\u03bd in the region near the \u2206 excitation can be calculated from summing all contributions from a(q) + N(p) \u2192 \u03c0(k) + N(p) with a = \u03b3, W, Z. We can write in general the\nhadron tensor W \u03bc\u03bd for electroweak pion reactions as\nW \u03bc\u03bd =\n\nX\n\n< f |J\u03b1\u03bc |i >\u2217 < f |J\u03b1\u03bd |i > ,\n\n(23)\n\nwhere \u03b1 = em, cc, nc denotes the considered current, and we have introduced concise notations\nX\n\n=\n\nXX\n\u012b\n\nf\n\n(2\u03c0)3 \u03b4 4 (p + q \u2212 p\u2032 \u2212 k)\n\nEN\n,\nmN\n\n(24)\n\nand\nv\nu\n\nm2N\n1 u\nt\n< k(t\u03c0 ), p\u2032 (s\u2032 , t\u2032 )|J\u03b1\u03bc (q)|p(s, t) > ,\n< f | J\u03b1\u03bc | i > =\n\u2032\n(2\u03c0)3 EN EN\n2E\u03c0\n\n(25)\n\nHere (s, t) denote the z-components of the nucleon spin-isospin, t\u03c0 the z-component of the\npion isospin, and < k(t\u03c0 ), p\u2032 (s\u2032 , t\u2032 )|J\u03b1\u03bc (q)|p(s, t) > is the a+N \u2192 \u03c0+N amplitude with a = \u03b3,\nW , Z for \u03b1 = em, cc, and nc, respectively. In the dynamical approach of Refs.[1, 2, 3], the\ncurrent matrix element Eq.(25) has the form of Eq.(16), consisting of a non-resonant term\nand a resonant term.\nFrom Eqs.(19) and (23), one can derive the expressions for calculating the structure\nfunctions W1 , W2 , and W3 from the current matrix elements defined by Eq.(25). It is\nconvenient to calculate these structure functions in the center of mass (c.m.) frame of the\ninitial aN and final \u03c0N systems. The direction of the momentum-transfer is chosen to\nbe the quantization z-direction : i.e. q = (\u03c9c , 0, 0, | qc |) for the exchanged boson and\np = (EN , 0, 0, \u2212 | qc |) for the initial nucleon.

They are\ndefined[41] by writing the hadron tensor for a polarized target with spin vector S \u03bc (S 2 =\n\u22121, p * S = 0) as\nW \u03bc\u03bd = WS\u03bc\u03bd + WA\u03bc\u03bd ,\n\n(30)\n\nwhere\nW2\np*q\np*q\nq\u03bcq\u03bd\n) + 2 (p\u03bc \u2212 2 q \u03bc )(p\u03bd \u2212 2 q \u03bd ) ,\n2\nq\nM\nq\nq\n\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2\n\u01eb\nq\u03b1\nS *q\n= i\n[g1 S\u03b2 + g2 (S\u03b2 \u2212\np\u03b2 )] .\np*q\np*q\n\nWS\u03bc\u03bd = W1 (\u2212g \u03bc\u03bd +\n\n(31)\n\nWA\u03bc\u03bd\n\n(32)\n\nWith some derivations, one can show that\n1\nQ2 y0\nX + X xy ] ,\n[\nQ2 \u03c9 2\n1 + \u03c92\n1\ny0\ng2 =\n\u2212 X xy ] ,\n2 [X\n1+ Q\n\u03c92\ng1 =\n\n(33)\n(34)\n\nwith\n\u03c9\ny0\nIm[Iem,em\n|s=S(x) ] ,\n|q|\nxy\n= \u2212mN Im[Iem,em\n|s=S(z)] ,\n\nX y0 = \u2212mN\n\n(35)\n\nX xy\n\n(36)\n\n\u03bc\u03bd\nwhere Iem,em\n|s=S(i) is the same as that defined in Eq.(29) except that the initial nucleon projection s is not summed over but is fixed in the chosen direction defined by S(i). S(x) (S(z))\nmeans that the initial nucleon spin is polarized in the direction perpendicular (parallel) to\nthe incident electron direction.\nFor investigating Quark-Hadron Duality, we would like to compare the structure functions\ncalculated from using the above formula for hadronic models with those calculated from the\nquark currents Eqs.(2)-(4) in the deeply inelastic region. With the standard definitions\n\nF1 (x, Q2 ) = mN W1 (x, Q2 ) ,\nF2 (x, Q2 ) = \u03c9W2(x, Q2 ) ,\nF3 (x, Q2 ) = \u03c9W3(x, Q2 ) ,\n\n(37)\n\nwhere x = Q2 /(2p * q) = Q2 /(2mN \u03c9), the Parton Model gives[41] (keeping only the contributions from the u and d quarks in the considered \u2206 region)\n8\n\n\fA.\n\np(e, e\u2032 )\n\n4\n1\n \u0304 Q2 ))] ,\nF2 (x, Q2 ) = x[ (u(x, Q2 ) + \u016b(x, Q2 )) + (d(x, Q2 ) + d(x,\n9\n9\nF1 (x, Q2 ) = F2 (x, Q2 )/2x ,\n4 \u2191\ng1 (x, Q2 ) =\n[u (x, Q2 ) \u2212 u\u2193 (x, Q2 ) + \u016b\u2191 (x, Q2 ) \u2212 \u016b\u2193 (x, Q2 )]\n18\n1\n+ [d\u2191 (x, Q2 ) \u2212 d\u2193 (x, Q2 ) + d \u0304\u2191 (x, Q2 ) \u2212 d \u0304\u2193 (x, Q2 )] .\n18\nB.\n\n(39)\n\n(40)\n\np(\u03bd, e\u2212 )\n\nF2 (x, Q2 ) = 2xF1 (x, Q2 ) = 2x(d(x, Q2 ) + \u016b(x, Q2 )) ,\nF3 (x, Q2 ) = 2(d(x, Q2 ) \u2212 \u016b(x, Q2 )) .\nC.\n\n(38)\n\n(41)\n(42)\n\np(\u03bd, \u03bd \u2032 )\n\n1\n1 3\nF2 (x, Q2 ) = 2xF1 (x, Q2 ) = x[ + ( \u2212 sin2 \u03b8W )2 ](u(x, Q2 ) + \u016b(x, Q2 ))\n4\n2 4\n1 2 2\n1\n \u0304 Q2 )) ,\n+x[ + (\u2212 + sin \u03b8W )2 ](d(x, Q2 ) + d(x,\n4\n2 3\n1 4 2\n2\nF3 (x, Q ) = [ \u2212 sin \u03b8W ](u(x, Q2 ) \u2212 \u016b(x, Q2 ))\n2 3\n1 2\n \u0304 Q2 )) .\n+[ \u2212 sin2 \u03b8W ](d(x, Q2 ) \u2212 d(x,\n2 3\n\n(43)\n\n(44)\n\nHere q(x, Q2 ), q\u0304(x, Q2 ) with q = u, d are the parton distribution functions (PDF) determined\nfrom fitting the data in deeply inelastic region. In Eq.(40) q \u2191\u2193 (x, Q2 ) are the spin dependent\nparton distribution functions. The structure functions for the neutron target can be obtained\nfrom Eqs.(38)-(44) by interchanging the u and d parton distribution functions. In actual\ncalculations, the strange quark and sea quark contributions are included, but are found\nto be very small in the considered \u2206 region. Thus our results presented below are from\nEqs.(38)-(44). This is consistent with the considered hadronic SL model which also neglects\nany possible reaction mechanisms involving intermediate strange hadrons.\nIV.\n\nQUARK-HADRON DUALITY\n\nWe now turn to exploring the Quark-Hadron Duality in the \u2206 excitation region. This is\ndone by comparing the structure functions calculated from Eqs.(38)-(44) using the CTEQ6\nparton distribution functions [45] with those from Eqs.(26)-(28) and (33)-(36) using the\nhadronic SL model described in section II. It is well known[13, 46, 47] that more quantitative\n9\n\n\ftests of Quark-Hadron Duality need to include target mass corrections. Furthermore, the role\nof the higher-twist effects must be better understood. For simplicity, we will not take such a\nmore involved procedure and will only compare all results from the SL model with the Parton\nModel predictions at Q2 = 10 (GeV/c)2 . Thus our goal here is more qualitative. We will\nfocus on exploring whether the neutrino-induced reactions show the similar Quark-Hadron\nDuality observed in (e, e\u2032 ). Furthermore we will also consider the spin dependent structure\nfunctions and parity violating asymmetry of p(~e, e) to which the procedures for including\nthe target mass corrections have not been developed. We follow the usual criterion[4, 8, 13]\nthat the local Quark-Hadron Duality is seen if the the predictions from our hadronic model\nare \"oscillating\" around the predictions from Parton Model such that their averaged values\ncould be very close after target mass corrections are included.\nFollowing the previous works, as reviewed in Ref.[8], we present the calculated structure\nfunctions as functions of the Nachtmann scaling variable defined by\n\u03be=\n2\n\n2x\n1 + (1 + 4x2 m2N /Q2 )1/2\n\n2\n\n(45)\n\nQ\n+\n= 2mQN \u03c9 is the Bjorken scaling variable. One can show[13] that \u03be = p+\nwhere x = 2p*q\nq /p\nis the fraction of the plus light-front momentum of the nucleon carried by the struck quark\nin the infinite momentum frame. The use of this variable includes some of the target mass\ncorrections, as discussed in Ref.[13]. We note here that in the \u03be < about 0.7 region the\nParton Model results at Q2 = 10 (GeV/c)2 will correspond to W > about 2 GeV which\nis much larger than the considered \u2206 region (1.1 GeV \u2264 W \u2264 1.4 GeV). For example, for\nQ2 = 1.5 (GeV)2 the \u2206 peak ( W = 1.232 GeV) occurs at \u03be = 0.57 which corresponds to\nW = 2.8 GeV at Q2 = 10 (GeV/c)2 .\nFirst we consider the p(e, e\u2032 ) processes. As reported in Refs.[9, 10], the recent data of\nstructure functions F1 and F2 from JLab have further established the Quark-Hadron Duality\nin the entire resonant region. This is illustrated in Fig.3 along with the results calculated\nfrom the SL model (solid curves near \u03be \u223c 0.6 ) in the \u2206 region. From now on, we will only\nconsider the data in the \u2206 region. In Fig.4 we compare our hadronic model calculations at\nQ2 = 0.7, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5 (GeV/c)2 (solid curves, from left to right) with these data. Each solid\ncurve covers the same \u2206 region with 1.1 GeV \u2264 W \u2264 1.4 GeV. We see that the predictions\nfrom the employed hadronic model (solid curves) agree well with the data and oscillate\naround the Parton Model predictions (dashed curve).\nTo pursue further, it is natural to ask, from the point of view of Standard Model, whether\nthe Quark-Hadron Duality observed in p(e, e\u2032 ) should also be seen in neutrino-induced processes. Experimental data for such investigations are still absent, but could be obtained at\nnew neutrino facilities in the near future. To facilitate these developments, we here present\npredictions for p(\u03bd, e\u2212 ) and p(\u03bd, \u03bd \u2032 ) processes. Since our model allows us to also predict\nthe structure functions for the neutron target and hence we will also provide predictions of\nFi,I=0 = (Fi,p + Fi,n )/2 for the isospin I = 0 deuteron-like target. Calculations for general\nnuclear targets, such as those considered in Ref.[48], are beyond the scope of this work.\nOur predictions for structure functions are shown in Fig.5 for (e, e\u2032 ), Fig.6 for (\u03bd, e\u2212 ),\nand Fig.7 for (\u03bd, \u03bd \u2032 ). Clearly all cases exhibit the similar feature of Quark-Hadron Duality.\nExperimental confirmations of our predictions (solid curves) shown in Figs.5-7 will be useful\nfor making further progress. If they are confirmed, our next step is to examine the local\nQuark-Hadron Duality quantitatively by including the target mass corrections[12, 46, 47]\nand considering the available information about the role of the higher twist effects.\n\n10\n\n\fAs reviewed in Ref.[8], an another criterion of the Quark-Hadron Duality is that the\nstructure functions in the resonance region should slide along the Parton Model predictions\nas Q2 increases. This is clearly the case in Figs.5-7 for Q2 < 4 (GeV/c)2 . In Fig.8 we further\nshow within the employed SL hadronic model that this should also be the case up to rather\nhigh Q2 = 20(GeV/c)2 where the high precision data for the \u2206 region could be obtained\nfrom the experiments with 12-GeV upgrade of JLab. The existing SLAC data[49, 50] do not\nhave enough high accuracy for investigating the \u2206 at Q2 \u2265 about 6 (GeV/c)2 .\nWe now turn to discussing the spin dependent structure functions g1 and g2 . We first note\ny0\ny\n0\nfrom Eqs.(33)-(36) that these functions depend on the interference terms Iem,em\n\u221d Jem\nJem\nxy\nx\ny\nand Iem,em \u221d Jem Jem . Such terms also determine various polarization observables of the\nexclusive p(~e, e\u2032 \u03c0) and p~(~e, e\u2032 \u03c0) precesses, as discussed in, for example, Ref.[51]. It is therefore\nimportant to test the SL model predictions against the recent data from such polarization\nmeasurements[21, 22]. It is clear from Figs.9-12 that the SL model can describe the JLab\ndata very well and certainly can be used here to investigate the spin dependent structure\nfunctions. The details of these comparisons can be found in Refs.[21, 22] and also in the\ncaptions of Figs.9-12.\nOur results for g1 and g2 of p(e, e\u2032 ) are shown in Fig.13. In the left side of Fig.13 we again\nsee that our predictions for g1 (solid curves) agree reasonably well with the data[23]. (Note\nthat the determination of these g1 data from the polarization data of Ref.[23] involved some\nmodel dependent input[52].) To get the Parton Model predictions using Eq.(40), we need\nto known the spin dependent parton distribution functions. However the determination of\nsuch information in the considered large x region is still in developing stage and therefore no\nattempt is made here to do calculation using Eq.(40). Instead, we assume that the Parton\nmodel predictions can be identified with the dashed curve which is from fitting the data of\ng1 measured in deeply inelastic scattering [53]. The left side of Fig.13 then indicates that\ng1 clearly does not exhibit the local Quark-Hadron Duality. Such a disagreement was in\nfact expected[54] by considering the constraints imposed by the Ellis-Jaffe integral[55] and\nDrell-Hearn-Gerasimov sum rule[56].\nIt is known[41] that the naive Parton Model, considered here, can not predict g2 . There\nare however some g2 data[57] from deeply inelastic scattering which can be described well\nby using the Wandzura-Wilczek formula[25]\ng2W W (x, Q2 )\n\nZ\n\n=[\n\n1\n\nx\n\ndy\ng1 (y, Q2 )] \u2212 g1 (x, Q2 ) .\ny\n\n(46)\n\nThe dashed curve in the right side of Fig.13 is obtained from the above formula using the\ndashed curve for g1 in the left as the input. Clearly it disagrees with the predictions (solid\ncurves) from the considered hadronic SL model. Unlike the result for g1 , there is no simple\nexplanation of such a similar breakdown of local Quark-Hadron Duality.\nThe Quark-Hadron Duality for the spin dependent structure functions of p(\u03bd, e) and\np(\u03bd, \u03bd \u2032 ) are not investigated here since there are no corresponding PQCD calculations or\ndata from deeply inelastic scattering data to compare with.\nV.\n\nPARITY VIOLATING ASYMMETRY\n\nThe formula for calculating parity violating asymmetry A of N(~e, e\u2032 ) reactions have been\ngiven in literatures[32]. For our purposes, we write it in terms of structure functions defined\n11\n\n\fin section III. With some straightforward derivations, we have\nd\u03c3(he = +1) \u2212 d\u03c3(he = \u22121)\nd\u03c3(he = +1) + d\u03c3(he = \u22121)\nQ2 GF N\n,\n= \u2212\u221a\n2(4\u03c0\u03b1) D\n\nA =\n\n(47)\n\nwith\nE + E \u2032 em\u2212nc\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\nW3\n,\nN = cos2 W2em\u2212nc + 2 sin2 W1em\u2212nc + sin2 (1 \u2212 4 sin2 \u03b8W )\n2\n2\n2\nM\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\nD = cos2 W2em\u2212em + 2 sin2 W1em\u2212em .\n2\n2\n\n(48)\n(49)\n\nHere the electromagnetic structure functions Wiem\u2212em are calculated from Eqs.(26)-(27) with\n\u03b1 = em. The interference term Wiem\u2212nc between the electromagnetic and neutral currents\ncan also be calculated from Eqs.(26)-(28) with the following replacements\ni\ni\n| i >< f | Jnc\n| i >\u2217\n|< f | J\u03b1i | i >|2 \u2192 < f | Jem\ni\ni\n| i >< f | Jem\n| i >\u2217 ,\n+ < f | Jnc\nx\ny\n< f | J\u03b1x |>< f | J\u03b1y | i >\u2217 \u2192 < f | Jem\n| i >< f | Jnc\n| i >\u2217\nx\ny\n+ < f | Jnc\n| i >< f | Jem\n| i >\u2217 .\n\u03bc\u03bd\nObviously these quantities can also be calculated from integration I\u03b1,\u03b2\ndefined in Eq.(29).\nem\u2212nc\nWe next focus on the first two terms of N of Eq.(48) which depend on W1,2\n. Here\nem\u2212nc\nwe note that W1,2\nis the symmetric part of the hadron tensor defined in Eq.(19). Hence\nthey can only have the contributions from the vector parts of neutral currents because of\nthe vector structure Eq.(5) of the electromagnetic current. To see this more clearly, we use\nEq.(8) to write the neutral current as\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\nJnc\n= Vnc\n\u2212 A\u03bc3 ,\n\n(50)\n\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n= (1 \u2212 2 sin2 \u03b8W )Jem\n\u2212 Visoscalar\n.\nVnc\n\n(51)\n\nwith\n\nem\u2212nc\nObviously the [\u2212A\u03bc3 ] part of Eq.(50) will not contribute to W1,2\nand hence the first two\nterms of N of Eq.(48) can then be written as\n\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\ncos2 W2em\u2212nc + 2 sin2 W1em\u2212nc = (1 \u2212 2 sin2 \u03b8W )(cos2 W2em\u2212em + 2 sin2 W1em\u2212em )\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\n+(cos2 W2em\u2212is + 2 sin2 W1em\u2212is )\n2\n2\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\n= (1 \u2212 2 sin2 \u03b8W )D + (cos2 W2em\u2212is + 2 sin2 W1em\u2212is ) ,\n2\n2\n\u03bc\nwhere D is defined in Eq.(49) and Wiem\u2212is is the same as Wiem\u2212nc with Jnc\nreplaced by the\n\u03bc\nisoscalar vector current [\u2212Visoscalar ] defined in Eq.(51). Thus only the non-resonant isospin\n\n12\n\n\fI = 1/2 \u03c0N state contribute to Wiem\u2212is . With the above relation, Eq.(47) for the asymmetry\ncan then be written as\nQ2 GF\nA = \u2212\u221a\n[2 \u2212 4 sin2 \u03b8W + \u2206V + \u2206A ]\n24\u03c0\u03b1\n= \u2212Q2 [8.99 \u00d7 10\u22125 ](1.075 + \u2206V + \u2206A ) ,\n\n(52)\n\nwhere Q2 is in unit of (GeV/c)2 and\n\u2206V\n\u2206A\n\ncos2 2\u03b8 W2em\u2212is + 2 sin2 2\u03b8 W1em\u2212is\n,\n=\nD\n\u2032\nW3em\u2212nc\nsin2 2\u03b8 (1 \u2212 4 sin2 \u03b8W ) E+E\nM\n.\n=\nD\n\n(53)\n(54)\n\nIn Eq.(52) we have evaluated (2 \u2212 4 sin2 \u03b8W ) \u223c 1.075 which is a model-independent constant\nand is the main contribution to the asymmetry. This term was identified by Cahn and\nGilman[32] and later investigators[33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40].\nWe now note that the term \u2206A defined by (54) depends only on W3em\u2212nc which is antisymmetric as defined in Eq.(19). Because of the vector structure of electromagnetic current\nEq.(5), W3em\u2212nc can only have the contributions from the axial vector parts of neutral currents. Clearly, the information about the axial vector N-\u2206 form factor, which is the quantity\nwe hope to learn about as discussed in section I, is isolated in \u2206A through its dependence\non W3em\u2212nc . Therefore it is important to identify the region where \u2206A is much larger than\n\u2206V such that the extracted axial N-\u2206 form factor has less model dependence.\nAs mentioned above, only the non-resonant isospin I = 1/2 \u03c0N final states contributes\nto Wiem\u2212is . Thus we expect that \u2206V is weaker than \u2206A near the \u2206 resonance. This is\nillustrated in Fig.14 for incident electron energy E = 1 GeV. We see that \u2206A (solid curve)\nis indeed much larger than \u2206V at energies near W = 1.232 GeV of the \u2206 position. This\nis also the case for other typical electron kinematics which can be conducted at JLab, as\nillustrated in Fig.15. The contribution from \u2206A (solid curves) are clearly much larger than\n\u2206V (dashed curves). Therefore the asymmetry data at resonance position W = 1.232 GeV\ncan be used to extract the contributions from the axial vector currents.\nWe now focus on examining how \u2206A depends on the axial N-\u2206 form factor. Recalling\nEqs.(16)-(18) for the current matrix elements, \u2206A , like other observables, contains contributions from the resonant and non-resonant amplitudes. As seen in Fig.16, the non-resonant\ncontribution (dotted curve near the bottom) is very small compared with the full model prediction (solid curve). This agrees with previous investigations[35, 38, 39, 40], although those\nearlier works neglected the unitary condition as discussed in section I. The large difference\nbetween the solid and the dotted curves in Fig.16 indicates that \u2206A is a useful quantity\nfor extracting the dressed axial N-\u2206 form factor defined by Eq.(18). When the pion cloud\neffects (second term of Eq.(18)) on the N-\u2206 transition is turned off, we obtain the dash\ncurves. This is consistent with our previous findings in Refs.[1, 2, 3] that pion cloud effects\non N-\u2206 transition are significant.\nWe present in Fig.17 our predictions of asymmetry A for several incident electron energies\nE = 0.8, 1.5, 2, 4 GeV and at the \u2206 peak. Here we note that our result for E = 0.8 GeV\nis about 10 % larger than that shown in Fig.6 of Ref.[38]. Furthermore, their A decreases\nwith Q2 in striking difference with our predictions. This is perhaps mainly due to the use of\ndifferent N-\u2206 form factor, but the differences in treating the non-resonant amplitudes, which\n13\n\n\finterfere with the dominant N-\u2206 transition amplitude, also play some roles. Experimental\ntests of our predictions in Fig.17 will be useful in examining the extent to which the axial\nN-\u2206 form factor Eq.(15), which was determined in our study[3] of (\u03bd\u03bc , \u03bc\u2212 \u03c0) reaction, is\nvalid.\nAs pointed out in Ref.[3], the form factor Eq.(15) is rather different from the form\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\nGA\nN,\u2206 (Q ) = (1 \u2212 \u03b1Q /(\u03b2 + Q ))GA (Q ) with \u03b1 = 1.21 and \u03b2 = 2 (GeV/c) which was\ndetermined in earlier works[27]. It is therefore interesting to see how these two form factors\ncan be distinguished by the parity violation asymmetry of p(~e, e\u2032 ). This is illustrated in\nFig.18. Experiment test of our prediction shown in Fig. 18 will help distinguish these two\naxial N-\u2206 form factors.\nTo end this section, We return briefly to the investigation of Quark-Hadron Duality\npresented in section IV. It is also interesting to explore[7] whether the Quark-Hadron Duality\nalso exists in the parity violating asymmetry A. This can be done here by comparing the\npredictions of our hadronic model and that of Parton model. The formula for calculating A\nwithin the Parton Model was derived in Ref.[32]. Keeping only the u and d quarks in the\nconsidered large x region, one finds for a proton target\n \u0304\n \u0304\n3GF Q2 2C1u [u(x) + \u016b(x)] \u2212 C1d [d(x) + d(x)]\n+ Y [2C2u (u(x) \u2212 \u016b(x)) \u2212 C2d (d(x) + d(x))]\n\u221a\nA=\n \u0304\n4(u(x) + \u016b(x)) + (d(x) + d(x))\n\u03c0\u03b12 2\n(55)\nwhere\n1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 y)2\n,\n(56)\n1 + (1 \u2212 y)2 \u2212 y 2 R/(1 + R)\n\u03c9\ny =\n,\n(57)\nE\n\u03c3L\nR =\n.\n(58)\n\u03c3T\nNote that R is the ratio between the longitudinal and transverse total cross sections. We\nuse the values of R calculated from the SL model. The variable y depends on incident\nelectron energy E and the energy transfer \u03c9. The other coefficients in Eq.(55) depend on\nthe electroweak coupling constants for leptons and quarks\n1 4\nC1u = gAe gVu = \u2212 + sin2 \u03b8W ,\n2 3\n1\n2\nC1d = gAe gVd = \u2212 sin2 \u03b8W ,\n2 3\n1\nC2u = gVe gAu = \u2212 + 2 sin2 \u03b8W ,\n2\n1\n(59)\nC2d = gVe gAd = \u2212 2 sin2 \u03b8W .\n2\nWhen the radiative corrections within the standard model is included [7, 58] C1u \u223c\n\u22120.1886, C1d \u223c 0.3414, C2u \u223c \u22120.0359, C2d \u223c 0.0265. These values are only slightly different from those calculated from Eq.(59).\nThe asymmetry of p(~e, e\u2032 ) predicted from our hadronic model (solid curves) and Parton\nModel (dashed curves) for several typical electron kinematics are compared in Fig.19. If\nour hadronic model results (solid curves) are confirmed experimentally, the parity violating\nasymmetry in the \u2206 region obviously does not show local Quark-Hadron Duality. The\nsituation is similar to the results for the spin dependent structure functions shown in Fig.14.\nY =\n\n14\n\n\fVI.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThe dynamical model developed in Refs.[1, 2, 3] (the SL model) has been extended to\ninclude the weak neutral current contributions for investigating all possible electroweak pion\nproduction reactions in the region near the \u2206 excitation. The main purpose is to examine\nthe Quark-Hadron Duality in the neutrino-induced reactions and to explore how the axial\nN-\u2206 transition form factor can be determined by using the parity violating asymmetry of\np(~e, e\u2032 ). The experimental data for testing our predictions can be obtained at JLab and new\nneutrino facilities.\nWe have found that the (e, e\u2032 ) structure functions F1 and F2 predicted by the SL model\nare in good agreement with the recent data[9, 10] which had verified more quantitatively\nthe Quark-Hadron Duality first observed by Bloom and Gilman[4]. The predicted structure\nfunctions for (\u03bd, e) and (\u03bd, \u03bd \u2032 ) processes also show Quark-Hadron Duality to the extent similar\nto what has been observed in (e, e\u2032 ). Furthermore, we also predict that Quark-Hadron\nDuality should also be seen in all electroweak reactions on the neutron or equivalently\nthe isospin I = 0 deuteron-like target. These results suggest that the SL model can be\na candidate hadronic model for developing a theoretical understanding of Quark-Hadron\nDuality within the Standard Model. For example, it will be interesting to explore which\nparts of the predictions from the SL model can be related to the predictions from the Parton\nModel. This is clearly a difficult question to answer and is beyond the scope of this paper.\nWe have also investigated the spin dependent structure functions g1 and g2 of (e, e\u2032 ). It\nis found that the Quark-Hadron Duality is not seen in the calculated g1 and g2 , while our\nresults for g1 and some polarization observables associated with the exclusive p(~e, e\u2032 \u03c0) and\np~(~e, e\u2032 \u03c0) reactions are in good agreement with the recent data. Experimental data for g2 in\nthe \u2206 region are clearly needed. If our predictions are confirmed, we perhaps have more\ncomplete information for exploring why the Quark-Hadron Duality breaks down in the spin\ndependent structure functions.\nWe should also emphasize that our investigations of Quark-Hadron Duality are rather\nqualitative since they are based on the naive Parton Model. To test local Quark-Hadron\nDuality quantitatively, we need to include target mass corrections[12, 47] and consider the\nroles of higher twist effects. In particular, the procedures for including these effects in the\ncalculations of spin dependent structure functions g1 and g2 and parity violating asymmetry\nA must also be developed.\nIn the investigation of parity violating asymmetry A of the inclusive p(~e, e\u2032 ), we have\nshown that the non-resonant contribution is small at the W = 1.232 GeV \u2206 peak and hence\na precise measurement of A can be used to improve the determination of the axial N-\u2206\ntransition form factor. We have also predicted that the parity violating asymmetry A, like\nthe spin dependent structure functions g1 and g2 , does not exhibit Quark-Hadron Duality.\nPredictions for the experiments which can be conducted at JLab have been given.\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe would like to thank A.
