In\nthe context of AdS/CFT [1], Minkowski space Green's functions can be computed from\ngravity using the recipe given in [2]. Unfortunately, for a non-extremal background, only\napproximate expressions for the correlators are usually obtained. Even thought the retarded Green's function in 4d cannot be found explicitly, the location of its singularities\ncan be determined precisely. As shown in [2], this amounts to finding the quasinormal\nfrequencies of dilaton's fluctuation in the dual near-extremal black brane background as\nfunctions of the spatial momentum. The possibility of a connection between the quasinormal frequencies of black holes and the quantum properties of the entropy spectrum\nwas first observed by Bekenstein [4], and further developed by Hod [5]. Bekenstein noted\nthat Bohr's correspondence principle implies that frequencies characterizing transitions\nbetween energy levels of a quantum black hole at large quantum numbers correspond to\nthe black hole's classical oscillation (quasinormal) frequencies (see also [6, 7]). In particular, Hod proposed that the real part of the quasinormal frequencies, in the infinite\ndamping limit (i.e. the n \u2192 \u221e limit), might be related via Bohr's correspondence principle to the fundamental quanta of mass and angular momentum (see also [8]\u2013[18]).\nIn asymptotically flat spacetimes the idea of QNMs started with the work of Regge and\nWheeler [19] where the stability of a Schwarzschild black hole was tested, and were first\nnumerically computed by Chandrasekhar and Detweiler several years later [20]. Recently,\nthere has been considerable interest in studing the quasinormal modes in different contexts: in AdS/CFT duality conjecture [21]\u2013[29], when considering thermodynamic properties of black holes in loop quantum gravity [30]\u2013[32], in the context of possible connection\nwith critical collapse [21, 25, 33], also when considering the area spectrum of black holes\n[34]-[39]. Recently it has been observed that the quasinormal modes can play a fundamental role in Loop Quantum Gravity [30]. Dreyer showed that in order to have consistence\nbetween the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy calculation and QNM frequencies, one had to\nassume that the minimum of j of the spin network piercing the horizon and contributing\nsignificantly to the entropy had to be j = 1. Whit this choice, the resulting Immrizi\nln \u221a\n3\nparameter would be given by \u03b3 = 2\u03c0\u03c0\n. He suggested that if the gauge group of the\n2\ntheory were changed from SU(2) to SO(3) then this requirement would be immediately\nsatisfied.\nFor the Schwarzschild black hole in four dimensions, the asymptotic real part of the gravitational quasinormal frequencies is of the form \u03c9 = TH ln3 where TH is the Hawking\ntemperature [40]. The suggestion of Hod was to identify h\u0304\u03c9 with the fundamental quantum of mass \u2206M. This identification immediately leads to an area spacing of the form\n\u2206A = 4h\u0304ln3. An elegant approach, for the schwarzschild black hole in d\u2212dimensions,\nbased on analytic continuation and computation of the monodromy of the perturbation\nwas proposed in [41], (to see more recent works refer to [42]).\nIn the present paper we extend directly the Kunstatter's approach [31] to determine mass\nand area spectrum of the near extremal black 3\u2212branes . According to this approach, an\nR dE\nadiabatic invariant I = \u03c9(E)\n, where E is the energy of system and \u03c9(E) is the vibrational\nfrequency, has an equally spaced spectrum, i.e. I \u2248 nh\u0304, applying the Bohr-Sommerfeld\nquantization at the large n limit.\n\n2\n\n\f2\n\nCoincident D-3 Branes\n\nWe consider now the background (in the string frame) of a black hole describing a number\nof coinciding D-3 branes [43, 44]\nds2 = H \u22121/2 (r)[\u2212f (r)dt2 +\n\n3\nX\n\n(dxi )2 ] + H 1/2 [f \u22121 (r)dr 2 + r 2 d\u03a925 ],\n\n(1)\n\ni=1\n\nwhere\n\nr04\nl4\n,\nf\n(r)\n=\n1\n\u2212\n,\n(2)\nr4\nr4\nand d\u03a925 is the metric of a unit 5\u2212dimensional sphere. The horizon is located at r =\nr0 and the extremality\nis achieved in the limit r0 \u2192 0. For l much larger than the\n\u221a\n\u2032\nstring scale \u03b1 , the entire 3\u2212brane geometry has small curvatures every where and is\nappropriately described by \u221athe supergravity approximation to type IIB string theory\n[43]. The requirement l \u226b \u03b1\u2032 translates into the language of U(N) SYM theory on N\ncoincident D \u2212 3branes. To this end it is convenient to equate the ADM tension of the\nextremal 3\u2212brane classical solution to N times the tension of a single D3\u2212 brane. Then\none can find [45]\n\u221a\n2l4 \u03a95\n\u03c0\n=N\n,\n(3)\n2\nk\nk\n\u221a\nwhere \u03a95 = \u03c0 3 is the volume of a unit 5\u2212sphere, and k = 8\u03c0G is the 10\u2212dimensional\ngravitational constant. Therefore\nkN\n(4)\nl4 = 5/2 .\n2\u03c0\nIn the other hand we have\nk = 8\u03c0 7/2 gs \u03b1\u20322 ,\n(5)\nH(r) = 1 +\n\nwhere gs is the string coupling, then we obtain\nl4 = 4\u03c0Ngs \u03b1\u20322 .\n\n(6)\n\nThe parameters l and r0 are related to the ADM mass in the following way\nM=\n\n\u03a95 V3 4\n(5r0 + 4l4 ).\n2\n2k10\n\n(7)\n\nNow we would like to consider the near-extremal 3\u2212brane geometry. In the near-horizon\n4\nregion, r \u226a l, we may replace H(r) by rl 4 . The resulting metric is as following\nr2\nr04 2\nl2\nr04 \u22121 2\n2\n\u2192\n\u2212\nds = 2 [\u2212(1 \u2212 4 )dt + d x ] + 2 (1 \u2212 4 ) dr + l2 d\u03a925 .\nl\nr\nr\nr\n2\n\n(8)\n\nThe above metric is a product of S 5 with a certain limit of the Schwarzschild black hole\nin AdS5 . The 8\u2212dimensional area of the horizon can be read off from metric (8). If the\nspatial volume of the D3\u2212brane is taken to be V3 , then we find\nAh = (\n\nr0 3 5\n) V3 l \u03a95 = \u03c0 6 l8 T 3 V3 ,\nl\n3\n\n(9)\n\n\fwhere T is a temperature\n\nr0\n.\n\u03c0l2\nUsing (4) we arrive at the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy [45]\nT =\n\nSBH =\n\n3\n\n\u03c0 2 N 2 V3 T 3\n2\u03c0Ah\n=\n.\nk2\n2\n\n(10)\n\n(11)\n\nQuasinormal Modes and Area Spectrum\n\nGiven a system with energy E and vibrational frequency \u03c9(E), one can show that the\nquantity\nZ\ndE\nI=\n(12)\n\u03c9(E)\nwhere dE = dM, is an adiabatic invariant [31] and as already mentioned in the Introduction, via Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization has an equally spaced spectrum in the large\nn limit\nI \u2248 nh\u0304 .\n(13)\nThe large n asymptotic behavior of quasinormal frequencies given by following expression[3]\n\u03c9n\u00b1 = \u03c90\u00b1 \u00b1 2\u03c0T n(1 \u2213 i),\n\n(14)\n\n\u03c90\u00b1 = \u03c0T \u03bb\u00b1\n0,\n\n(15)\n\nwhere\nwhere \u03bb\u00b1\n0 \u2248 \u00b11.2139 \u2212 0.7775i. Now by taking \u03c9R as\n\u03c9R = \u00b1\u03c0T (2n + 1.2139),\n\n(16)\n\nthen by substituting Eq.(10) we get\n\u03c9R =\n\n\u00b1r0\n(2n + 1.2139).\nl2\n\n(17)\n\nBy taking M as given by Eq.(7) and substituting Eq.(6), we obtain\nM=\n\nV3\n(5r04 + 16\u03c0Ngs \u03b1\u20322 ).\n4\n\u20324\n2\n128\u03c0 \u03b1 gs\n\n(18)\n\nThen, the parameter r0 is given by\nr0 = (aM \u2212 b)1/4 ,\nwhere\na=\n\n128\u03c0 4 \u03b1\u20324 gs2\n,\n5V3\n\nb=\n\n16\u03c0N\u03b1\u20322 gs\n.\n5\n\n(19)\n\n(20)\n\nNow by taking \u03c9R as given by expression (17) and substituting Eqs.(19,6), we get\n\u03c9R =\n\n\u00b1(aM \u2212 b)1/4\n\u221a\n(2n + 1.2139).\n2\u03b1\u2032 \u03c0Ngs\n4\n\n(21)\n\n\fThus, the adiabatically invariant integral (12) is written as\n\u221a\nZ\ndM\n\u00b12\u03b1\u2032 \u03c0Ngs\n,\nI=\n(2n + 1.2139) (aM \u2212 b)1/4\n\n(22)\n\nand after integration, we obtain\nI=\n\n\u221a\n5V3 N\n3/2\n\n48\u03c0 7/2 \u03b1\u20323 gs (2n + 1.2139)\n\n(aM \u2212 b)3/4 .\n\n(23)\n\nNow using Eqs.(10,19) we can rewrite the area of the horizon Eq.(9) as\nAh = \u03c0 3 l2 V3 r03 = \u03c0 3 l2 V3 (aM \u2212 b)3/4 .\n\n(24)\n\nUsing Eq.(23) the area is given by following expression\nAh =\n\n3 7 \u20324 2\n3(2n + 1.2139) 7 \u20324 2\n\u03c0 \u03b1 gs I =\n\u03c0 \u03b1 gs (2n + 1.2139)nh\u0304.\n160\n160\n\n(25)\n\nIt is obvious that the area spectrum, although discrete, is not equivalently spaced. The\nquasinormal frequencies which given by Eq.(14) was later generalized in the paper by\nNunez and Starinets [46], Eqs. (3.22-3.23), but all these formulas are asymptotics rather\nthan exact results. However, for vector perturbations (and spatial momentum on the\nbrane equal to zero) the spectrum turns out to be exact and given by following relation\n\u03c9n = n(1 \u2212 i),\n\nn = 0, 1, ...\n\n(26)\n\ntherefore, the integral Eq.(12) yields\nI=\n\nM\n,\nn\n\n(27)\n\nand by equating expressions (27) and (13), we get\nM = n2h\u0304.\n\n(28)\n\nIt is obvious that the mass spectrum of 3\u2212black brane is quantize.\n\n4\n\nConclusion\n\nThe possibility of a connection between quasinormal modes and the area spectrum of\nblack holes has been actively pursued over the past year. Many examples have been\nstudied, and progress has been made towards a general understanding of this connection.\nBekenestein's idea for quantizing a black hole is based on the fact that its horizon area,\nin the nonextremal case, behaves as a classical adiabatic invariant. It is interesting to\ninvestigate how near extremal black 3\u2212branes would be quantized. Discrete spectra arise\nin quantum mechanics in the presence of a periodicity in the classical system, which in\nturn leads to the existence of an adiabatic invariant or action variable. Boher-Somerfeld\nquantization implies that this adiabatic invariant has an equally spaced spectrum in the\nsemi-classical limit. Kunstatter showed that this approach works for the Schwarzschild\n5\n\n\fblack holes in any dimension, giving asymptotically equally spaced areas, previously we\nhave showed generalization to non-rotating BTZ, extremal Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m, near extremal Schwarzschild-de Sitter Kerr and extremal Kerr black holes [34, 35, 36, 37] is also\nsuccessful. In this article we have considered the near extremal black 3\u2212branes. Using the\nresults for highly damped quasi-normal modes Eq.(14), we obtained the area spectrum of\nevent horizon Eq.(25), which is obvious that the area spectrum, although discrete, is not\nequivalently spaced. Using the generalized form of quasinormal modes Eq.(26), we obtained mass spectrum of near extremal 3\u2212black brane as Eq.(28). Similar situation occur\nfor BTZ black hole[34] which the area of event horizon is not equally spaced, in contrast\nwith area spectrum of black hole in higher dimension, although the mass spectrum is\nequally spaced.\n\nAcknowledgement\nI would like to thank Prof. Andrei O.
