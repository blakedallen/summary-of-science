Introduction\nIn a continuum framework, the linear polarization response P to a strain field \u03b5 in\na crystalline dielectric is typically given as\nPi = eijk \u03b5 ij\n\n(1)\n\ne is the third-rank piezoelectric tensor which couples strain to polarization. e,\nbeing an odd order tensor, vanishes identically for centrosymmetric crystals and\nthus only those dielectrics which possess a non-centrosymmetric crystal\nstructure exhibit piezoelectricity.\nIn crystalline centrosymmetric dielectrics, where piezoelectricity is absent (e=0),\na non-uniform strain can locally break the inversion symmetry of the unit cell,\nresulting in an induced dipole moment. In such a case, the bulk contribution to\nthe polarization as a response to an applied macroscopic strain-gradient may be\nwritten as\n\u2663\n\nCorresponding author: psharma@uh.edu\n\n1\n\n\fPi = \u03bcijkl u j ,kl\n\n(2)\n\nThe phenomenological fourth-order tensor \u03bc introduced in Eqn. (2) is known as\nthe flexoelectric tensor and the associated phenomenon wherein a macroscopic\nstrain gradient 1 induces a linear polarization response in a dielectric is termed\nflexoelectricity [1]. \u03bc , being a tensor of even order, is non-zero for crystals of\nany symmetry. Therefore the polarization response to an applied deformation in\na dielectric may be re-written as\nPi = eijk \u03b5 jk + \u03bcijkl u j , kl\n\n(3)\n\nThe phenomenon of flexoelectricity in crystalline dielectrics was first\npredicted by Maskevich and Tolpygo [2]; a phenomenological description was\nlater proposed by Kogan [3] who included a term coupling the polarization and\nthe strain-gradient in the thermodynamic potential of the form\nf ijkl Pu\ni j , kl\n\n(4)\n\nMore recently, Tagantsev [4-5] has investigated this phenomenon in detail\nand has clarified several issues regarding the bulk nature of flexoelectricity and\ncontributions due to surface and dynamic effects.The fourth order tensor f\nintroduced in Eqn. (4) can be related to the flexoelectric tensor \u03bc in Eqn. (3) and\nit symmetries are now well-known. Kogan [3] estimated the flexoelectric\nconstants \u03bcijkl to be of the order of e/a, where e is the electronic charge and a,\nthe lattice parameter. Multiplication by the dielectric constant was later suggested\nwhich appears to have been confirmed experimentally in a series of studies by\nCross and co-workers [6-9].\nYet another body of work, which parallels the theory of flexoelectricity in some\nways, is the polarization gradient theory due to Mindlin [10-11]. Based on the\nlong-wavelength limit of the shell-model of lattice dynamics, Mindlin [10] found\nthat the core-shell and the shell-shell interactions could be incorporated\nphenomenologically by including the coupling of polarization gradients to strain\nand the coupling of polarization-gradients to polarization-gradients respectively in\nthe thermodynamic potential (Eqns.5a-b)\nd ijkl Pi , j \u03b5 kl\nbijkl Pi , j Pk ,l\n\n(5a-b)\n\nThe polarization-gradient strain coupling and the polarization strain-gradient\ncoupling is often included in the energy density expression as a Lifshitz invariant\n1\n\nA macroscopic strain gradient implies that the gradient in strain exists over a macroscopically\nlarge length scale L>>a (where a is the characteristic length scale of the material; in crystals it\ncan be chosen to be equal to the lattice parameter).\n\n2\n\n\f[3,13] as shown in expression (6) on account of the fact that total derivatives\ncannot occur in the expression for energy.\nhijkl ( uij Pk ,l \u2212 Pk uij ,l )\n\n(6)\n\nIt can also be shown that the dispersive contributions due to the term (5a) in the\nthermodynamic potential involving polarization gradient terms and due to\nexpression (4) involving flexoelectricity are of the same order in the wave vector\nand cannot be isolated from one another. The symmetries of the tensors d and b\nare also known [10]. Under the framework of Mindlin's polarization gradient\ntheory, Askar et al [14] have arrived at numerical estimates of tensors d and b by\nrelating them to shell model parameters for the cases of NaCl, NaI, KI, and KCl\nbut as will be shown later, Askar et al's [14] estimates for the components of\ntensor d are more likely the values of a combination of components of tensor d\nand those of the tensor f which occurs in the context of flexoelectricity (Eqn.4).\nIn addition to the arguments presented above, yet another motivation to include\nhigher order gradients of strain and polarization in the formulation of a continuum\ntheory for crystalline dielectrics appears while investigating dynamic phenomena.\nClassical electromagnetism may be safely applied to excitations belonging to any\npart of the spectrum whereas classical linear elasticity (wherein the elastic\nenergy involves only the first derivatives of displacement) is a \"long wavelength\ntheory\" and designed to be applicable only in a certain frequency regime.\nTherefore a hybrid electromechanical theory is limited in its applicability due to its\nelastic part. The inclusion of gradients of strain and polarization along with\nhigher-order inertia terms to the elastic part of the free energy can extend the\napplicability of a hybrid electromechanical field theory to frequencies in the region\nof 1 THz (far-infrared region) where dispersive effects become significant [15-16].\nIt should be noted that while the flexoelectric effect introduces spatial dispersion,\npolarization-gradients (and polarization-inertia effects) can model frequency\ndispersion effects.\nThe phenomenon of flexoelectricity in crystalline dielectrics 2 has been\nexperimentally observed in a variety of contexts: bending of crystal plates [17]\nand measurements of thin films [18]. It has also been variously invoked to explain\nthe anomalous capacitance of thin dielectric films [18] and the weak sizedependent piezoelectric behavior of carbon and boron-nitride nanotubes [19-20].\nMacroscopic electromechanical effects in dislocated diatomic crystals of nonpiezoelectric dielectrics, wherein large strain-gradients in the vicinities of\ndislocations lead to induced polarization [21], may also be explained using\nflexoelectricity. Some works have reported large flexoelectric effects in low\n2\n\nIt is interesting to note that the term flexoelectricity originated in the liquid crystal and biological\nmembrane literature to describe curvature induced polarization in flexed membranes of orientable\nmolecules. In this work however, we concern ourselves with flexoelectricity in crystalline\ndielectrics only.\n\n3\n\n\fdimensional systems such as nanographitic systems [22] and two dimensional\nboron-nitride sheets [23]. In addition, some recent theoretical works seem to\nsuggest that flexoelectric effects can assume importance in various nanoscale\nelectromechanical phenomena, especially in high-dielectric materials e.g. \"giant\"\npiezoelectricity in perovskite dielectric nanostructures, piezoelectric composites\nwithout using piezoelectric materials among others [24-26]. However, very few\natomistic investigations to estimate the flexoelectric constants exist in the\nliterature. Experimental determination of flexoelectric constants for some\nperovskite dielectrics have been carried out by Cross and co-workers [6-9] and\nZubko et al [27] while from a theoretical viewpoint, Sahin and Dost [28] provide\nsome estimates for KTaO3 predicated on phonon dispersion data. In the present\nwork, using an approach outlined by Tagantsev [4-5], we employ a lattice\ndynamics based method to extract the flexoelectric coefficients for certain\nrepresentative ionic salts NaCl and KCl, III-IV semiconductors GaAs and GaP, IIVI semiconductors ZnO and ZnS, and finally high dielectric constant perovskites\nBaTiO3(BTO) ,SrTiO3(STO) and PbTiO3 (PTO) in their cubic phases. We report\nestimates for the flexoelectric constants from both density functional theory (DFT)\nbased ab initio lattice dynamics and empirical shell models. Wherever possible,\nwe compare our results with previously published theoretical calculations or\nexperimental results. Flexoelectric coefficients of perovskite dielectric materials\nare of particular interest---large flexoelectric effects have been consistently\nobserved in experimental studies on bent thin films of high-permittivity perovskite\ndielectric materials [6-9] as well as atomistic simulations on bent nanostructures\n[22-23]. This has important ramifications in perovskite dielectric thin\nfilm/nanostructure based technologies such as nanocapacitors and energy\nharvesting applications [24-26, 29].\nThe outline of our paper is as follows. In Section 2, we present a brief overview of\na continuum theory involving the first-gradients of strain and polarization. We\nshow how inclusion of appropriate terms in the electro-elastic energy density can\nlead to a linear polarization response to an applied strain gradient i.e.\nflexoelectricity. In Section 3, a microscopic lattice dynamics based analysis is\ncarried out which identifies the atomistic origins of flexoelectricity. Certain\nsubtleties associated with this phenomenon are also discussed. Section 4\noutlines a recipe (due to Tagantsev [4-5]) to calculate bulk flexoelectric constants\nfor crystalline dielectrics from lattice dynamical data. In Section 5, we bring out\nsome differences between the approach of Tagantsev to calculate flexoelectric\nconstants and that of Askar et al's [14] to calculate Mindlin's polarization gradient\nconstants. The numerical values of the flexoelectric constants for some selected\nmaterials presented in Section 6. Finally we discuss the physical reasons\nresponsible for the high flexoelectric constants displayed by perovskite dielectric\nmaterials in Section 7 as well as the reasons for the observed discrepancies\nbetween our theoretical estimates the available limited experimentally data.\n\n4\n\n\f2. Continuum flexoelectricity: Linear polarization response due to a strain\ngradient\nThe general formulation of an electromechanical theory involving first-gradients\nof strain and polarization has been discussed elsewhere [28]. Here we provide a\nbrief summary. If one includes terms involving gradients of strain and polarization\nin the thermodynamic potential, then a hybrid internal energy density function can\nbe written of the form\n\u03a3=\n\n1\n1\n1\nakl Pk Pl + hijk PP\nbijkl Pi , j Pk ,l + cijkl \u03b5 ij\u03b5 kl\ni j , k + eijk Pi \u03b5 jk +\n2\n2\n2\n+\nr\n\u03b5\nu\n... + dijkl Pi , j\u03b5 kl + fijkl Pu\ni j , kl\nijklm ij k ,lm + g ijklmn ui , jk ul , mn ...\n\n(7)\n\na ,e and c are the familiar second order reciprocal dielectric susceptibility tensor,\nthird order piezoelectric tensor and the fourth order elastic constant tensor\nrespectively. f is the fourth-order flexoelectric tensor introduced in (4) while b and\nd are fourth-order tensors from (5). The third order tensor h couples the\npolarization to its gradient while the fifth order tensor r couples strain and straingradient. Tensor r is sometimes referred to as the acoustic gyroscopic tensor.\nTensor g represents elastic nonlocality and dictates the strength of the\nbiquadratic strain-gradient coupling [15-16]: it also serves the purpose of\nsmoothing out distribution of fields.\nBalance equations and constitutive relations for the electromechanical stresses\ncan be derived by carrying out a variational analysis of the Lagrangian derivable\nfrom Eqn. (7). The interested reader is referred to the paper by Sahin and Dost\n[28] wherein this variational analysis has been carried out in exhaustive detail.\nIn the absence of an external electric field and free charges, the following\nexpression involving the polarization and its gradient can be deduced from the\nbalance equations and constitutive laws\n\n(a\n\nij\n\n+ \u03b5 0 \u22121\u03b4 ij ) Pj = dijkl \u03b5 kl , j \u2212 ( eijk \u03b5 jk + fijkl u j , kl ) + hijk ( Pk , j \u2212 Pj , k ) + bijkl Pk ,lj\n\n(8)\n\nFor a centrosymmetric material, the third order tensors in Eqn. (8) vanish\n\n(a\n\nij\n\n+ \u03b5 0 \u22121\u03b4 ij ) Pj = dijkl \u03b5 kl , j \u2212 fijkl u j , kl + bijkl Pk ,lj\n\n(9)\n\nThe above expression shows that following the energy density expression of Eqn.\n(7), the polarization response is linearly related to the strain-gradient.\nFrom a microscopic point of view, the terms involving polarization-gradients in\nthe expression for the internal energy density (7) can be shown to bear analogs\nto certain interaction energy terms occurring in a shell type lattice dynamical\nmodel. In particular, the shell-shell interactions can be modeled through the\nbiquadratic coupling of polarization-gradients to themselves while the core-shell\ninteractions can be modeled via the coupling of polarization-gradients to strain.\n5\n\n\fUsing this approach, Askar et al [14] have carried out explicit calculations to\nestimate the independent components of the tensors b and d for NaCl and KCl in\nterms of corresponding shell model parameters. On the other hand, as discussed\nby Tagantsev [4-5], a simple rigid ion model, which approximates atoms as\nconsisting of ionic cores devoid of a shell of electrons, suffices to make the\nconnection with the phenomenological flexoelectric coupling. In the following\nsection, we will outline Tagantsev's approach to calculating the flexoelectric\nconstants using a simple rigid-ion model for lattice dynamics. Further, we will\nalso bring out some important differences between Tagantsev's approach to\ncapture flexoelectricity induced spatial dispersion using a rigid-ion model and\nAskar et al's [14] approach to capture polarization-gradient induced frequency\ndispersion using a shell-type lattice dynamical model. In doing so, we also hope\nto make physically transparent, the microscopic origins of both flexoelectricity\nand polarization-gradient effects.\n\n3.

Following the assumption of linearity,\n\u2202xk\nu(1)and u(2) can be cast in the form\njk\nui(1) ( R ) = ui(1)\n, p = Ai , p \u03b5 jk ( R ) ;\n\njkl\nui(2) ( R ) = ui(2)\n, p = Bi , p\n\n\u2202\u03b5 jk\n\u2202xl\n\n(R)\n\n(15)\n\nth\nu (1)\np denotes the sub-lattice shift of the p atom in the unit cell under the influence\n\nof a uniform strain; this quantity vanishes for all atoms in a centrosymmetric unit\nth\ncell. On the other hand, u (2)\natom in\np signifies the internal displacement of the p\nresponse to the applied strain-gradient and is non-zero in principle for crystals of\nany symmetry.\nFollowing the displacements of expression (15), the polarization change due to\nsuch internal motions is given by\n\n\u03b4 P = (V \u2032 )\n\n\u22121\n\n\u2211 Q ( R\u2032) R\u2032 \u2212 (V ) \u2211 Q ( R ) R\n\u22121\n\nR\u2032\n\nR\n\n(16)\n\nV and V' are the volumes of the crystal before and after deformation and Q(R) is\nthe charge of the particle at R.

Under such\nconditions, the spontaneous polarization P0 and the quadrupole moment density\nQ both vanish. Further, the induced polarization caused due to internal\ndisplacement of atoms ui(1) ( R ) in response to a macroscopic strain corresponds\nto the piezoelectric effect. Thus, the induced polarization due to flexoelectricity\ncan be isolated as\n\nPfl =\n\n\u2202\u03b5\nI \u2202\u03b5 ij\n+ v \u22121Q p Bi ,jklp jk\n2 \u2202xk\n\u2202xl\n\n(19)\n\nv is the volume of the unit cell while Qp is the effective charge of the pth atom.\nThe first term on the right hand side of (20) can be identified as the surface\nflexoelectric contribution [1-2] while the second term can be identified as the bulk\nflexoelectric contribution.\n\nThus the bulk flexoelectric tensor \u03bcijkl can be identified from (19) as\n\n\u03bcijkl = v \u22121Qp Bi ,jklp\n\n(20)\n\nIt may be noted from (19) that polarization due to flexoelectricity is induced as a\nconsequence of internal shifts among atoms within a unit cell due to an applied\nstrain-gradient i.e. a dipole is created within a unit cell when atoms carrying\nopposite charges suffer a net displacement with respect to each other leading to\na macroscopic polarization. Therefore, for flexoelectricity to exist, it is imperative\nthat a strain gradient exists at the level of a unit cell i.e. there is a spatial variation\nof strain within the unit cell.\nTo further illuminate this point, consider the arrangement of atoms which form a\npart of a periodic 2-D ionic crystalline solid as shown in Fig (1). The red balls\ndenote positive ions with unit charge while the blue ions denote negative ions\nwith unit charge. We assume that this configuration is in stress-free equilibrium.\n\n3\n\nThe macroscopic electric field is associated with the non-analyticity of the lattice dynamical\nmatrix at near zero wave vectors. Therefore, while investigating flexoelectric coefficients using\nlattice dynamical methods, the non-analytical contribution to the dynamical matrix should be\nremoved. This point will be further elaborated in Section III.\n\n8\n\n\fFig 1: A finite undeformed arrangement of atoms in an ionic 2-D crystal. The unit cell chosen is\nhighlighted within the dashed line. The blue balls denote anions while the red balls denote cations.\nSince the centers of positive and negative charge coincide, the net dipole moment is zero.\n\nThe dipole moment is given by\n\np=\n\na\n3a\n5a\n7 a 4a\n\u2212 a + \u2212 2a + \u2212 3a +\n\u2212\n=0\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\n(21)\n\nThus, the dipole moment of the arrangement of atoms shown in Fig. (1) is zero.\nNow we stretch each unit cell uniformly, but the amount of stretch in each unit\ncell is different such that an infinite strain gradient exists at the boundary of each\nunit cell (Fig.2).\n\nFig 2: The configuration of Fig.1 is deformed in such a manner that each unit cell is stretched\nuniformly but the amount of stretch varies from cell to cell. Even though strain-gradients exist at\nthe interfaces of the unit cells we have chosen, there is no net dipole moment created since the\ncenters of positive charge and negative charge of each unit cell still coincide.\n\nThe dipole moment of the above arrangement becomes\n\np=\n\na\n\u03b2\u239e\n\u239b \u03b1\u239e\n\u239b\n\u2212 a + \u239c1 + \u239f a \u2212 (1 + \u03b1 ) a + \u239c1 + \u03b1 + \u239f a \u2212 (1 + \u03b1 + \u03b2 ) a\n2\n2\u23a0\n\u239d 2\u23a0\n\u239d\na\n\u03b3\u239e\n\u239b\n... + \u239c1 + \u03b1 + \u03b2 + \u239f a \u2212 (1 + \u03b1 + \u03b2 + \u03b3 ) = 0\n2\u23a0\n2\n\u239d\n\n(22)\n\nThus even though strain-gradients exist at the interface of the unit cells, there is\nno induced polarization. For flexoelectricity to exist, the strain has to vary at the\nlevel of the unit cell such that the resulting internal shifts between differently\ncharged atoms constituting the unit cell create dipoles. Further, for flexoelectricity\n9\n\n\fto be a macroscopically observable effect, the strain gradient has to exist over a\nmacroscopically large extent of the crystal such that the polarization averaged\nover several unit cells remains finite.\nYet another subtlety relates to the distinction between surface and bulk\nflexoelectricity. The phenomenon of flexoelectricity is pictorially explained as\nfollows. Consider again an arrangement of atoms which form a part of periodic 2D ionic crystalline solid as shown in Fig. (3a). For convenience, we only depict\ntwo unit cells.\n\nFig.3a) Shows the undeformed stress free configuration of a portion of a 2-D diatomic ionic solid.\nFig. 3b) Shows the deformed configuration wherein each atom is subjected to an inhomogeneous\ndisplacement of the form u ( rx ) = crx , where rx is the x-coordinate of the position vector of that\n2\n\natom.\n\nIn the equilibrium stress-free configuration of Fig. (3a), the centers of positive and\nnegative charges coincide and there is no net dipole moment. Now if an\ninhomogeneous displacement of the form u (rx ) = crx2 , where rx stands for the xcoordinate of an atom and c is a constant, is applied to the stress-free\nconfiguration of Fig. (3a) and the atoms are clamped, then dipoles are created in\neach unit cell as is shown in Fig. (3b). However, this induced polarization is a\nresult of surface flexoelectricity and corresponds to the first term on the righthand side of Eqn. (19). If, under the conditions of an inhomogeneous stress, the\natoms are 'unclamped' and allowed to relax, they undergo further internal shifts\ncorresponding to the displacements up(2) of Eqn. (15). It is the additional\npolarization created due to these internal shifts which corresponds to the bulk\nflexoelectric effect corresponding to the second term on the right-hand side of\nEqn. (19).\nAnother point deserves mention. Even though, flexoelectricity in principle can be\nobserved in all materials, one can see from the discussion above that in\nmaterials where effective charges of atoms Qp are zero, say for example a single\nelement material like graphene where no effective charges can be assigned to\natoms in the unit cell, the bulk flexoelectric constant of expression (20) becomes\nzero. However, flexoelectricity can still occur in such materials purely due to\nelectronic wave function overlap effects. Indeed, Dumitrica et al. [18] have\ndemonstrated the presence of flexoelectricity induced polarization in curved\ncarbon nanoshells (Fig.4). The rigid-ion model can however not take into account\n10\n\n\fsuch effects and this is indeed a limitation of the approach we adopt in this paper.\nIn the following section we will outline an approach to calculate B (Eqn. 15) and\nsubsequently the flexoelectric constant (Eqn. 20) from harmonic lattice dynamics.\n\nFig. 4 The curvature of a bent sheet of graphene results in rehybridization of p-orbital. As a result,\nthe center of electronic charge at each atomic site is displaced outwards from the nuclear charge.\nThis results in a curvature induced dipole moment.\n\n4. Determination of flexoelectric constants: A lattice dynamics approach\nConsider an acoustic wave traveling in an effectively infinite crystal with wave\u22121\nvector k such that k is much less than the crystal dimensions but much larger\nthan the lattice parameter a. The displacement of the pth atom in the nth unit cell\nassociated with such a wave can be written as\n\nri ,np = ui , p e\n\n(\n\ni k .R np \u2212\u03c9t\n\n)\n\n(23)\n\nThe amplitude of displacement u p corresponding to the pth atom of a unit cell\ncorrected to include first order spatial and frequency dispersion effects can be\nwritten from Eqn. (14) as\n\nui , p = wi + iAi ,jkp w j kk \u2212 Bi ,jklp w j kk kl \u2212 Gi ,j p w j\u03c9 2\n\n(24)\n\nIn (24), w is the amplitude of the pure acoustic wave. For a pure acoustic phonon\nmode (k->0), the amplitude of displacement ui , p is independent of p i.e. all atoms\noscillate with the same amplitude of vibration. Physically speaking, this\ncorresponds to a uniform deformation in classical continuum elasticity. The\nremaining terms on the right hand side of (24) correspond to internal shifts which\noccur because of the inherent discreteness of the crystal. The operator G\ncorresponds to frequency dispersion corrections to the displacement amplitude\nand can be shown to be related to polarization inertia effects.\nNow consider the Hamiltonian of a crystal written in the harmonic approximation\n\n11\n\n\fH = \u03a60 +\n\n2\n1\n1\nm p ( ri n, p ) + \u2211 \u03a6 ipnn,i' ' p ' ri n, p ri n', 'p '\n\u2211\n2 nip\n2 nip\n\n(25)\n\nn 'i ' p '\n\nHere, \u03a60 is the static (equilibrium) potential energy of the crystal and\n\n\u03a6 ipnn,i' ' p ' constitute the elements of the so-called force constant matrix. In particular,\n\u03a6 ipnn,i' ' p ' =\n\n\u2202 2\u03a6 \u239e\n\u239f\n\u2202ri n, p \u2202ri n', 'p ' \u23a0\u239f\n\n(26)\n0\n\nHere, \u03a6 is the total potential energy of the crystal assumed to be some function\nof the instantaneous positions of all the atoms.\nNow the equations of motion for the lattice can be derived as\nm p &&\nri ,np = \u2212\n\n\u2202\u03a6\n= \u2212 \u2211 \u03a6 ipnn,i' ' p ' ri n', p' '\nn\n\u2202ri , p\nn 'i ' p '\n\n(27)\n\nThe equations of motion (27) form an infinite set of simultaneous linear\ndifferential equations. Their solution can be simplified by exploiting the periodicity\nof the lattice if we choose as a solution to (27) a function of the form\n\nri n, p = ui , p e\n\n(\n\ni k .R np \u2212\u03c9t\n\n)\n\n(28)\n\nAfter substituting the expression for r from Eqn. (28) into Eqn.

(30) can be solved in a perturbative manner for\nsmall k by the method of long waves. We will accordingly expand all the\nquantities appearing in (30) in powers of k upto second order.\nCip ,i ' p ' ( k ) = Cip(0),i ' p ' + \u2211 Cip(1),i 'j p ' k j +\nj\n\nui , p ( kj ) = u\n\n1\nCip(2),i 'jlp ' k j kl + ...\n\u2211\n2 \u03b3\u03bb\n\n( kj ) + ui(1), p ( kj ) + ui(2), p ( kj ) + ...\n(2)\n\u03c9 j ( k ) = \u03c9 (1)\nj ( k ) + \u03c9 j ( k ) + ...\n(0)\ni, p\n\n(31a-c)\n\n12\n\n\fIn case of ionic materials, the perturbative expansion of Eqns. (31a-c) presents\nproblems because even the lowest order term in the expansion of the dynamical\nmatrix diverges because of long-range electrostatic forces. This is dealt with by\nseparating the electrostatic field at a point into a local Lorentzian field plus a\nglobal macroscopic electric field. Further, the contribution of the macroscopic\nfield to the dynamical matrix can be identified with the non-analytical terms of the\ndynamical matrix which cause divergent behavior at near zero wave vectors. The\nshort range contributions to the dynamical matrix due to short range forces and\nthe Lorentz field can then be treated in a perturbative manner. However, as has\nbeen previously pointed out, the flexoelectric coefficients, by definition, measure\nthe polarization response under the application of a uniform strain gradient in the\nabsence of a macroscopic electric field. Thus in case of both weakly polar\nmaterials (like GaAs) and highly polar materials (like BTO) we exclude the\ncontribution of the macroscopic electric field while calculating the dynamical\nmatrix in Eqn. (31). This contribution is likely to be small for less polar materials\nlike GaAs while one expects a large contribution due to the macroscopic field in a\nhighly polar solid like BTO.\nThe expansion coefficients in Eqn.

For a unit cell\ncontaining r atoms, p varying from 0 to r-1, the 3r\u00d73r matrix \u0393 in (34b-c) is\ndefined as\n\n\u0393 ip ,i ' p ' = \u0393 ip(3,ri \u2212' p3)'\n\np, p ' \u2260 0\n(35)\n\n= 0 otherwise\n\nHere, \u0393 (3r \u22123) is the inverse to the (3r-3) \u00d7 (3r-3) matrix Cip(0),i ' p ' (p,p'=1,2,...,r-1).\n% introduced in Eqn.

The denser the grid of phonon wave-vectors, the larger is the\ndistance of the farthest neighbor to an atom for which interatomic constants can\nbe calculated. Therefore, for a material like BTO for which long-range interatomic forces become important, one would be better served by generating the\nphonon dispersions over a large grid of wave-vectors.\n5. Tagantsev's approach to estimate flexoelectric constants vs. Askar et\nal.'s approach to calculate polarization-gradient constant\nTagantsev's [4] approach to calculating flexoelectric constants employs a simple\nrigid-ion model. The flexoelectric polarization in this approach stems from the fact\nthat in the long wavelength limit, different atoms (which correspond to ionic cores)\nin the same unit cell move by different amounts which corresponds to first order\ndispersive corrections. If one revisits the expression for the amplitude of\n14\n\n\fdisplacement of the pth atom in a unit cell in the long-wavelength limit, one\nnotices that the dispersive correction term involving A corresponds to the internal\ndisplacement of the atom in response to a uniform strain up (1), while the terms\ninvolving B and G correspond to the internal displacement of the atom in\nresponse to an applied strain-gradient up (2).\n\nui , p = wi + iAi ,jkp w j kk \u2212 Bi ,jklp w j kk kl \u2212 Gi ,j p w j\u03c9 2\n\n(38)\n\nThe flexoelectric polarization simply spawns from the dipole created within\na unit cell due to internal displacements of various ionic cores within the unit cell.\n\nPflexo,i = v \u22121Qp ui(2, p)\n\n(39)\n\nOn the other hand, Askar et al [14] use a shell type model to extract the\npolarization gradient constants b and d for centrosymmetric crystals NaCl, NaI,\nKCl, and KI. In order to illustrate their approach, consider a NaCl like crystal with\ntwo atoms per unit cell. In a shell like model, the outermost electron shell is\nconsidered to be a rigid spherical \"shell\" which can move with respect to the\nmassive ionic \"core\" which consists of the nucleus and the inner electron shells.\nThe position of pth atom in the nth unit cell is denoted by rpn\nThe charge of the pth atom is given by\n\nQ p = X p + Yp\n\n(40)\n\nWhere X p and Yp are the charges of the core and shell of the pth atom\nrespectively. The constraint of neutrality implies\n\n\u2211Q\n\np\n\n=0\n\np\n\n(41)\n\nFor the shell model, the positions of both the core and the shell, before\ndeformation are given by rpn . Their positions after deformation are respectively,\n\nR np,1 = rpn + u np\nR np,2 = rpn + u np + w np\n\n(42)\n\nu is the displacement of the core and w is the displacement of the shell with\nrespect to the core.\nThe fact that the core and shell of each ion/atom carry different charges and that\nthey can be displaced with respect to each other implies that when an effective\nelectric field acts on the core and on the shell, they will suffer a relative\ndisplacement inducing a dipole moment at the ion/atom location porportional to\nthe electric field strength. The proportionality constant is given by the\npolarizability of the ion \u03b1 p which enters into the shell model as a parameter. At\n15\n\n\fthe same time, even in the absence of an effective field, when two ion cores are\nbrought closer together, the equilibrium positions of the centers of the\ncorresponding shells need not coincide with the position of the cores, so that a\ndipole moment is induced on each ion/atom which is proportional to the\ndisplacement of the core. Thus the deformability and polarizability of each ion is\nincluded in the shell model. While in the rigid ion model, the dipole moment\ninduced due to an electric field is only due to movement of rigid ions, in case of a\nshell model, additional contributions to the dipole moment arise as a result of the\npolarizability of the ion and also as a contribution due to the redistribution of\ncharge in the region of overlap between neighboring ions. This latter contribution\nexists even in the absence of the first and is present for materials such as\ngraphene and silicon which are made up of atoms and not ions. This is perhaps\none of the biggest disadvantages of using a rigid ion model.\nNow, under the assumption of a rigid ion model, let us consider an acoustic wave\nin the crystal such that\n\nu np = u p e\n\n(\n\ni k .rpn \u2212\u03c9t\n\n)\n\n; w np = w p e\n\n(\n\ni k .rpn \u2212\u03c9t\n\n)\n\n(43)\n\nIn the long wavelength limit, Askar et al [14], assume that the amplitude of\ndisplacement of the cores are the same i.e. u p does not depend upon p. They\nneglect any internal displacements amongst the atoms as a result of first-order\ndispersive effects at low k-wavevectors. Instead, they assume a one-ion\npolarizable model wherein only one shell corresponding to a highly polarizable\natom is capable of displacing with respect to its core. Say for example, in the\ncase of NaCl, Na being numbered 1 and Cl being numbered 2, Askar et al [14]\napproximate w1= 0 owing to the low polarizability of Na compared to that of Cl.\nThus, in the long wavelength limit one has\n\nu1 = u 2 = u\nw1 = 0; w 2 = w\n\n(44)\n\nThe dipole moment per unit cell (i.e. the polarization is)\n\n1\nP = \u23a1\u23a3Q1ueik .r1 + ( Q2u + Y2 w ) eik .r2 \u23a4\u23a6\nv\n\n1\nY2 w\nv\n\n(45)\n\nThus the polarization is attributed entirely to the displacement of the shell of the\nhighly polarizable atom. In this regard, the displacement of the atoms u and the\npolarization which is decided by w, become independent quantities. In the rigid\nion model on the other hand, the polarization and the displacement of atoms are\ninherently related since it is the relative displacement of the atomic cores which\ncauses a dipole moment to arise. So in the rigid-ion model which is devoid of\nshells, the approach of Askar et al [14] will yield zero values for the polarization\ngradient constants.\n6. Results\n16\n\n\fIn this section we present the values for the bulk flexoelectric constants for\ni) III-IV semiconductors GaAs , GaP and II-VI semiconductor ZnS\nii) Alkali Halides NaCl and KCl\niii) Perovskite dielectrics BTO and STO in their paraelectric phase.\nWherever possible we have tried to employ both ab initio and empirical shell\nmodel lattice dynamics to estimate the values for the flexoelectric constants.\nHowever, in some cases only one of these techniques is used either due to lack\nof accurate shell model potentials (for empirical lattice dynamics) or reliable\npseudopotentials (for carrying out DFT based lattice dynamics). Ab initio phonon\ndispersions of GaAs were calculated in the local density approximation (LDA)\nusing a norm-conserving pseudopotential generated by Giannozzi et al. [30],\nfollowing a scheme proposed by von Barth and Car. A kinetic energy cut-off of 25\nRydbergs (Ry) was chosen and 60 q points were used for the Brillouin zone (BZ)\nintegration. An equilibrium lattice parameter of 5.612 \u00c5 as suggested by\nGiannozzi et al. [30] was chosen. The dynamical matrices were generated on an\n8\u00d78\u00d78 k-point mesh, and an inverse Fourier transform was carried out to\ngenerate the real space interatomic force constants. Ab initio phonon dispersions\nof BTO were calculated in the local density approximation (LDA) using Vanderbilt\nultrasoft pseudopotentials. A kinetic energy cut-off of 90 Ry was chosen and a\nMonkhorst 6\u00d76\u00d76 grid of q points were used for the Brillouin zone (BZ)\nintegration. An equilibrium lattice parameter of 4.00 \u00c5 was used. The dynamical\nmatrices were generated on an 8\u00d78\u00d78 k-point mesh. Ab initio phonon\ndispersions of STO were calculated in the local density approximation (LDA)\nusing Vanderbilt ultrasoft pseudopotentials. A kinetic energy cut-off of 90 Ry was\nchosen and a Monkhorst 6\u00d76\u00d76 grid of q points were used for the Brillouin zone\n(BZ) integration. An equilibrium lattice parameter of 3.85 \u00c5 was used. The\ndynamical matrices were generated on an 8\u00d78\u00d78 k-point mesh, and an inverse\nFourier transform.Parameters for the shell lattice-dynamical model for GaAs,\nGaP and ZnS have been taken from Kunc et al. [31-32].

As one can see, our estimates for the flexoelectric\nconstants of STO possess the same order of magnitude as those experimentally\nprovided by Zubko et al [27]. On the other hand our estimate for \u03bc12 of BTO is\nsmaller than that estimated by Ma and Cross by three orders of magnitude. It is\ninteresting to note that in a recent ab initio study, scientists in Cambridge\nemployed an alternative approach to estimate the flexoelectric constants of\nferroelectric BTO and found them to be of the same order of magnitude as our\nestimates. The same group however report numbers close to Ma and Cross's [9]\nresults for BTO while adopting an experimental approach. The possible reasons\nfor such discrepancies are discussed in Section 7.\n\n\u03bc11 (10-13C/cm)\n\n\u03bc12 (10-13C/cm)\n\n\u03bc44 (10-13C/cm)\n\nAb initio\n\nExperiment\n\nAb initio\n\nExperiment\n\nAb initio\n\nExperiment\n\nSTO\n\n-26.4\n\n20\n\n-374.7\n\n700\n\n-357.9\n\n300\n\nBTO\n\n15.0\n\n-na-\n\n-546.3\n\n106\n\n-190.4\n\n-na-\n\nTable 4: Flexoelectric constants for cubic perovskite materials STO and BTO from ab initio\ncalculations compared with available experimental data (Zubko et al. [27] for STO and Ma and\nCross [9] for BTO)\n\nIn a recent ab initio study, scientists at Cambridge [33] have demonstrated, by\nemploying an entirely different approach, that the flexoelectric constants for\nperovskite dielectric BTO and Lead Titanate and paraelectric STO have\nflexoelectric constants in the range of 1nC/m which, atleast to an order of\nmagnitude, agrees with our estimates.\n7. Discussion and Summary\nIn light of the values obtained for the materials considered in the previous section,\nit is clear that flexoelectric constants of perovskite dielectrics like BTO, STO are\nlarger than those of conventional dielectrics like III-IV semiconductors, II-VI\nsemiconductors and ionic salts like NaCl by as much as four orders of\nmagnitude. This peculiar property of incipient perovskite dielectrics can be\nattributed not only to their anomalously large born effective charges but also to\nthe existence of strong coupling between the transverse acoustic modes and the\nsoft transverse optic modes so characteristic of incipient perovskite dielectrics\n[34]. This coupling lends itself to strong spatial dispersive effects which results in\nlarge atomic displacement responses to a non-homogeneous mechanical\nstimulus. Consequently, the internal sub-lattice shifts for such perovskite\ndielectrics due to an applied strain gradient may be orders of magnitude higher\nthan those exhibited by conventional dielectrics. The transverse acoustic mode in\nsuch materials is known to exhibit anomalously large dispersion even at small kvectors which suggest that elastic non-local effects in them (characterized by the\ntensor g in Eqn. (3)) may also be much larger than conventional materials.\n19\n\n\fAs already indicated in the previous section, our estimates for STO are in the\nsame order of magnitude as observed experimentally by Zubko et al. [27]. A few\nimportant factors should be kept in mind while interpreting the results. Typically,\nexperiments to measure flexoelectric constants employ finite dimensional\ncantilever beams (for dynamic measurements) or thin films (subjected to static\nbending experiments). Due to the finite dimensions of these structures, surface\npolarization effects may affect the values of the measured flexoelectric constants.\nWe report the bulk flexoelectric constants: surface flexoelectricity is omnipresent\nin experiments on finite structures [which the experiments employ] and does not\ndisappear in the absence of a macroscopic electric field. There are indications\nthough that surface flexoelectric constants maybe several orders of magnitude\nlesser than bulk flexoelectric constants for high permittivity materials and may not\naffect the values of the bulk flexoelectric constants measured in experiments.\nFurther, broken symmetry at the surface of such finite structures may cause\nsurface piezoelectricity which may contribute to the experimentally measured\npolarization. In addition as Zubko et al [27] point out, recent works [35] have\nindicated surface regions which are 100 \u03bc ms deep with local fluctuations of the\nferroelastic phase transitions that may induce spontaneous flexoelectric\npolarization in addition to that resulting from inhomogeneous stress caused\nduring bending experiments. In view of the above mentioned points, Zubko et al.\n[27] suggest that their measurements should be viewed as order of magnitude\nestimates. Considering the latter caveat, our results and those of Zubko et al. are\nin broad agreement. Further, from a theoretical point of view, the phonon\ndispersions from ab initio simulations are extremely sensitive to kinetic energy\ncut-offs and the size of the grid employed to do Brillouin zone integrations: the\nestimates of the unstable modes (which are important to capture the large\nflexoelectric constants of perovskite dielectrics) are therefore somewhat suspect\nthough we have ensured that the inter-atomic force constants we use are\nsufficiently converged.\nHowever, for the case of BTO, there is a large discrepancy between our\nestimates and the experimental results of Ma and Cross [9]. Another independent\ngroup of workers from Cambridge [33] have used both ab initio and experimental\ntechniques to estimate the flexoelectric constants for BTO. It is interesting to note\nthat while our estimates for BTO match those of their ab initio estimates, there\nexists a large discrepancy with their experimental results which are closer to\nthose published by Ma and Cross [9]. The reason for this may be the extreme\nsensitivity of the soft optic mode to temperature in such perovskite dielectrics. At\nfinite temperatures, at which experiments are performed, a large TA-TO coupling\nmay exist which in turn can explain the rather high value of the flexoelectric\nconstants consistently observed by Cross and co-workers [6-9] for several\nmaterials. Since our lattice dynamics calculations assume zero temperature,\nthere is a possibility of the existence of such a large discrepancy.\nThe magnitude of the flexoelectric constants are known to scale as f= \u03bb\u03b5 e / a , \u03b5\nbeing the relative permittivity of the dielectric and \u03bb being a dimensionless\nscaling factor. While from our results it is clear that the flexoelectric constants do\n20\n\n\fscale with the dielectric constant: small flexoelectric constants are observed for\nconventional dielectrics with \u03b5 of the order of 10 and large flexoelectric constants\nare observed for perovskite dielectrics (3-4 orders of magnitude larger than\nconventional dielectrics) whose relative permittivity is of the order of 103, our\nresults (as well as experiments by Zubko et al. [27]) suggest that the empirical\nscaling factor \u03bb may be of the order of 10-2 which is in contrast to Ma and Cross\n[9] who estimate to \u03bb ~1\nAcknowledgements:\nFinancial support from NSF NIRT Grant No. CMMI 0708096 (Clark Cooper) and\nNSF Grant No. CMMI 826153 (Ken Chong) is gratefully acknowledged.\nReferences\n1.
