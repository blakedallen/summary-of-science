INTRODUCTION\nMatter and field are basic concepts of classical field theories. They play a fundamental\nrole in the general relativity theory [1, 2], where the Einstein tensor G\u03bd\u03bc is expressed in\nterms of the geometry of space-time, and the matter is represented by its momentumenergy density tensor T\u03bc\u03bd . These two intrinsic concepts are connected by the Einstein\nfield equation\n\nG\u03bd\u03bc = \u22128\u03c0 T\u03bc\u03bd .\n\n(1)\n\nAccording to EQ. (1), a given distribution of matter (-sources) determines the geometric\nproperties of space-time. One can regard this as the creation of space-time geometry by\nmatter. Now, one can read EQ. (1) in the opposite direction, and expect for the creation of\nmatter by geometry. Thus, what geometry and which mechanism have brought matter\ninto being in our 4-dimensional world? Among others theories Wesson's Induced Matter\nTheory (IMT) [3\u20138] provides an elegant answer based on the creation of matter by\ngeometry of the 5-dimensional (5D) bulk. In the Weyl-Dirac modification [9, 10] of\nWesson's IMT the bulk induces on the 4D brane both, gravitation and electromagnetism,\nas well gravitational matter and electric current.\nNow, as a considerable amount of conventional matter appears in the form of particles,\nit would be interesting to look for a mechanism of creating fundamental particles in the\nframework of the Weyl-Dirac modification of Wesson's IMT (cf. [11].\nIn the present note we investigate the possibility of creation 4D neutral and electrically\ncharged particles, induced by the 5D bulk in the framework of the Weyl-Dirac\nmodification of Wesson's theory.\nThese particles are to be regarded as constituents of elementary particles (like quarks\nand leptons) and are characterized by their charge being 0 ; \u00b1 13 e , with e - the electron\ncharge, as well by mass. Thus every quark or lepton is made up of three of these particles.\nThese fundamental classical particles having charge and mass are taken to be spinless and\nto have spherical symmetry. It is expected that, when they are quantized, they will\nacquire a spin, as in the case of a point particle described by the Dirac equations.\nPresumably the particles have other properties such as color hypercolor etc. However,\nthese will be left to be dealt with in the future.\n\n2\n\n\fIn the present work following conventions are valid: Uppercase Latin indices run\n\nfrom 0 to 4; lowercase Greek indices run from 0 to 3. Partial differentiation is denoted by\na comma (,), Riemannian covariant 4D differentiation by a semicolon (;), and\nRiemannian covariant 5D differentiation by a colon (:). Further, the 5D metric tensor is\ndenoted by g AB , its 4D counterpart by h\u03bc\u03bd ; sometimes 5D quantities will be marked by a\n~\ntilde, so R21 is the component of the 4D Ricci tensor, whereas R21 belongs to the 5D one,\n\n~ ~\nR \u2261 R\u03c3\u03c3 is the 4D curvature scalar, R \u2261 RSS - the 5D one.\n\n2. THE EMBEDDING FORMALISM. THE FIELD EQUATIONS\nFollowing the ideas of Weyl [12, 13] and Dirac [14], developed by Nathan Rosen [15]\nand the present writer [16, 17], the Weyl-Dirac version of Wesson's IMT was proposed\nrecently [9, 10].\nIn Wesson's original IMT one considers a 5D manifold {M} (the bulk), mapped by\n\n{ }\n\ncoordinates x N\n\n(N=01234) and possessing the metric tensor g AB = g BA . As shown in a\n\nprevious paper [9] of the present writer, there are serious reasons for a revision of\nWesson's IMT. It was found that the induced geometry on a 4D brane is non-integrable.\nThis non-integrability follows from the structure of the bulk. In Wesson's original 5D\nIMT, one regards the bulk as pure geometry without any additional fields. The geometry\nis described by the metric tensor g AB . Thus, the principal phenomenon, which carries\ninformation, is a metric perturbation propagating in the form of a gravitational wave. In\norder to avoid misinterpretations one must assume that all gravitational waves have the\nsame speed. Therefore, in the 5D bulk, the isotropic interval dS 2 = 0 has to be invariant,\nwhereas an arbitrary line element dS 2 = g AB dx A dx B may vary. The situation resembles\nthe 4D Weyl geometry, where the light cone is the principal phenomenon describing the\nspace-time and hence the light-like interval ds 2 = 0 is invariant rather than an arbitrary\nline-element ds 2 = h\u03b1\u03b2 dy \u03b1 dy \u03b2 between two space-time events (Cf. [12, 13]). Adopting\nthe ideas of Weyl and Dirac, in every point of the 5D bulk in addition to the metric tensor\n~ A (x D ) and of\ng AB (x D ) = g BA (x D ) the existence of a Weylian length connection vector w\n\n3\n\n\f~ and \u03a9 are integral\na Dirac gauge function \u03a9 was assumed. The three fields g AB , w\nC\nparts of the geometric framework, and no additional fields, sources or particles exist in\n~ , are\nthe bulk {M}. It is empty. In this 5D manifold, field equations for g and w\nAB\n\nC\n\nderived from a geometrically based action. It turns out that the equation for \u03a9 is actually\n~ - equations, so that the Dirac gauge function may be\na corollary of the g - , and w\nAB\n\nC\n\nchosen arbitrarily.\nBelow follows a concise description of the general embedding formalism. The\nnotations as well as the geometric construction given below accord to these given in\nworks of Paul Wesson and Sanjeev S. Seahra [3-7], as well in works of the present writer\n[9, 11].\nAs mentioned above, one considers a 5-dimensional manifold { M } (the \"bulk\") with\nthe metric g AB . The latter has the signature sig ( g AB ) = (+,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212, \u03b5 ) with \u03b5 = \u00b11 . The\n\nmanifold is mapped by coordinates { x A } and described by the line-element\ndS 2 = g AB dx A dx B\n\n( A, B = 0,1, 2, 3, 4)\n\n(2)\n\nOne can introduce a scalar function l = l (x A ) that defines the foliation of {M} with 4D\nhyper-surfaces \u03a3 l at a chosen l = const, as well the vector n A normal to \u03a3 l . If there is\nonly one time-like direction in {M}, it will be assumed that n A is space-like. If {M}\npossesses two time-like directions (\u03b5 = +1) , n A is a time-like vector. Thus, in any case\nthe brane \u03a3 l contains three space-like directions and a time-like one. The brane, our 4D\nspace-time, is mapped by coordinates { y \u03bc }, and has the metric\n\nh\u03bc\u03bd = h\u03bd\u03bc\n\nwith sig (h\u03bc\u03bd ) = (+,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212) . The line-element on the brane is (cf. (2))\n\n(\u03bc ,\u03bd\n\nds 2 = h\u03bc\u03bd dy \u03bc dy\u03bd\n\n= 0, 1, 2, 3)\n\n(3)\n\n( )\n\nIt is supposed that the relations y\u03bd = y\u03bd (x A ) and l = l x A , as well as the reciprocal one\nx A = x A ( y\u03bd , l ) are mathematically well-behaved functions. Thus, the 5D bulk may be\nmapped either by {x A } or by {y\u03bd , l }.\n\n4\n\n\fA given 5D quantity (vector, tensor) in the bulk has a 4D counterpart located on the\nbrane. These counterparts may be formed by means of the following system of basis\nvectors, which are orthogonal to n A\ne\u03bdA =\n\n\u2202x A\n\u2202y\u03bd\n\nn A e\u03bdA = 0\n\nwith\n\n(4)\n\nThe brane \u03a3 l is stretched on four (\u03bd = 0, 1, 2, 3) five-dimensional basis vectors e\u03bdA . In\naddition to the main basis {e\u03bdA ; n A } one can consider its associated one {e\u03bdA ; n A }, which\nalso satisfies the orthogonality condition e\u03bdA n A = 0 . The main basis and its associated are\nconnected by the following relations:\ne\u03bdA e A\u03bc = \u03b4 \u03bd\u03bc ; e\u03c3A e B\u03c3 = \u03b4 BA \u2212 \u03b5 n A n B ; n A n A = \u03b5\n\n(5)\n\nLet us consider a 5D vector V A ; V A in the bulk {M}. Its 4D counterpart on the brane\n\u03a3 l is given by\nV\u03bc = e \u03bcA V A ; V \u03bd = e\u03bdB V B .\n\n(6)\n\nOn the other hand the 5D vector may be written as\n\n(\n\n)\n\n(\n\n)\n\nV A = e A\u03bc V\u03bc + \u03b5 VS n S n A ; V A = e\u03bcA V \u03bc + \u03b5 V S n S n A\n\n(7)\n\nFurther, the 5D metric tensor, g AB ; g AB and the 4D one, h\u03bc\u03bd ; h \u03bc\u03bd are related by\nh\u03bc\u03bd = e\u03bcA e\u03bdB g AB ; h \u03bc\u03bd = e A\u03bc e\u03bdB g AB ; with h\u03bc\u03bd h \u03bb\u03bd = \u03b4 \u03bc\u03bb\ng AB = e A\u03bc e B\u03bd h\u03bc\u03bd + \u03b5 n A n B ; g AB = e\u03bcA e\u03bdB h \u03bc\u03bd + \u03b5 n A n B ; with g AB g CB = \u03b4 AC\n\n(8)\n(9)\n\nConsidering the bulk of the Weyl-Dirac modification of Wesson's IMT we have to pay\n~ and to the 5D field\nattention to the Weylian length connection vector w\nA\n~\n~ \u2212w\n~ . There is also the Dirac gauge function \u03a9(x B ) and its partial\ntensor WAB \u2261 w\nA, B\nB, A\nderivative \u03a9 A \u2261\n\n\u2202\u03a9\n~ induces on the brane its counterpart w (cf.

Substituting y (r ) = e \u2212 \u03bb = e\u03bd as well (78) we obtain\nr\n\ny \u2032r 3 + yr 2 \u2212 r 2 = \u221232\u03c0 \u222b \u03c1 r 3 dr\n\n(80)\n\n0\n\nThus, our entity is described by the following equation\ny \u2032\u2032 +\n\n4\n2\n2\ny \u2032 + 2 y \u2212 2 = \u221232\u03c0\u03c1\nr\nr\nr\n\n(81)\n\nAssume we have a known expression for y (r ) . Then we can account from (81) the\nmatter density \u03c1 (r ) , from (78, 79) the charges q~ (r ) and Q as well from (76) the\nmass M . There are of course many possibilities of choosing an appropriate y (r ) . It turns\nout that in the interior of the entity ( 0 \u2264 r \u2264 rb ) a suitable representation is the bell-like\nfunction\ny=\n\nwith k \u2261\n\n\u03c0\nrb\n\n1\nsin 2 (kr )\nk r\n2 2\n\n(82)\n\n; ( k = cm \u22121 ). This is a well-behaving function: y (r ) \u2265 0; y (0) = 1; y (rb ) = 0 .\n\nInserting (82) into (81) one obtains\n8\u03c0\u03c1 =\n\n1 \u2212 cos(2kr ) sin 2 (kr )\n=\n\u2261 k2y\n2r 2\nr2\n\n(83)\n\nThus, for the mass density \u03c1 (r ) \u2265 0 ; 8\u03c0\u03c1 (0 ) = k 2 ; \u03c1 (rb ) = 0 .\nFurther, substituting \u03c1 into (78), and choosing a suitable value of the constant of\nintegration, we obtain the effective charge inside a sphere of radius r ( r \u2264 rb ).\n2\n\n1\n1\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\nq~ 2 (r ) = \uf8efr cos(kr ) \u2212 sin (kr )\uf8fa ; and q~(r ) = \u00b1 \uf8efr cos(kr ) \u2212 sin (kr )\uf8fa\nk\nk\n\uf8f0\n\uf8fb\n\uf8f0\n\uf8fb\n\n21\n\n(84)\n\n\fAccording to (84)\nq~(0) = 0; and Q \u2261 q~ (rb ) = rb\n\n(85)\n\nTo obtain \u03c8 one can equate (72a) and (83). This leads to the result\n\n(\u03c8 \u2032)2 = 4k 2\n\n=> \u03c8 \u2032 = \u00b12k ;\n\nand \u03c8 = \u00b12k r + Const\n\n(86)\n\nChoosing Const = m2\u03c0 we have\n\n\u03c8 = \u00b1(2k r \u2212 2\u03c0 )\n\n(87)\n\nso that \u03c8 (r = 0) = m2\u03c0 and \u03c8 (r = rb ) = 0 .We will also assume \u03c8 = 0 for r > rb .\nTo account the external mass M, one starts from (76) and makes use of (83) and (84).\nAs a result one obtains\nM =\n\n1\nQ2\nrb +\n2\n2rb\n\n(88)\n\nand making use of (85) one has\nM = Q = rb\n\n(89)\n\nIt is interesting that for neutral particles (Sec. 4 and 5) there was M neutral =\n\n1\nrb . Thus, we\n2\n\ncan interpret (88) as consisting of two parts, the first representing the proper gravitational\nmass, the second being the electromagnetic mass.\nIn order to obtain the charge density \u03c1 e inside the entity we recall that for a spherically\nr\n\n\u03bb\n\nsymmetric distribution of matter the charge is given by q = 4\u03c0 \u222b e 2 \u03c1 e r 2 dr . Making use\n0\n\nof (82) and (84) one obtains\n4\u03c0 \u03c1 e =\n\nsin 2 kr\nr2\n\n(90)\n\nComparing this with (83) we conclude that\n\n\u03c1e = 2\u03c1\n\n(91)\n\n&~& , which invoked the charge.\nIt would be of course interesting to obtain the function w\n0\n&~& may be obtained from (72)\nTaking into account (84) w\n0\n2\n&~& = e 3 (kr \u2212\u03c0 ) \uf8ee 5 sin (kr ) \u2212 5 k cos(kr ) \u2212 k sin (kr ) \uf8f9 sin (kr )\nw\n0\n\uf8ef\uf8f0 3 r 2\n3\nr\nr \uf8fa\uf8fb k 2 r 2\n5\n\n22\n\n(92)\n\n\f2\n&~& (0) = e \u2212 3\u03c0 k 2 \u2261 e \u2212 3\u03c0 \u03c0\nFrom (92) one obtain w\n0\n2\nrb\n5\n\n5\n\n&~& (r ) = 0 ; so that there is no\nand w\n0 b\n\n&~& vanishes.\nsingularity at the center, whereas at the boundary w\n0\nIn the present section a plausible model of charged fundamental particles created by\nthe bulk in the Weyl-Dirac modification of Wesson's IMT was obtained. It is believed\nthat more models may be found besides the considered above.\n\n7. DISCUSSION\nIs it possible to describe singularity-free particles from the classical (non-quantum)\nstandpoint? Einstein and collaborators were certain that particles having inner structure\ncan be considered in the framework of general relativity. As long ago in 1935 Albert\nEinstein and Nathan Rosen in their celebrated work [20] presented an interesting solution\nto the problem, with a charged particle described as a \"bridge\" 4.\nLater, in 1991, N, Rosen and the present writer presented general relativistic models\n[21, 22] of fundamental particles consisting of prematter, the latter satisfying the equation\nof state \u03c1 + P = 0 .\nIn the present paper, models of fundamental neutral and charged particles in the Weyl\n\u2013 Dirac version [9, 10] of Wesson's IMT [3-8] are presented. These are induced by the\n5D Weyl-Dirac-Wesson bulk in the empty 4D brane, our universe. In this framework\nmodels of neutral and electrically charged fundamental particles are carried out. In all\nconsidered models, the interior is filled with a substance, being in the state of prematter\n(cf. Ref. [18, 19]).\nThe reason for taking prematter as a substance suitable for describing the inside of\nparticles is the following. Let us suppose one is looking for extremely small fundamental\nparticles having a noticeable mass. This seems to be possible only with an enormous\nmass density \u03c1 . One can expect that at such densities the properties of matter will be\n\n4\n\nIn this celebrated work the basic concept of the \"Einstein \u2013 Rosen Bridge\", a precursor\nof wormholes was introduced.\n\n23\n\n\fvery different from those, with which we are acquainted. Bearing in mind that we lack\nany knowledge whatsoever of the constitution of matter and its behavior under such\nextreme conditions, let us assume that inside the particle the matter tensor is simply\nrelated to the metric tensor in the sense that\nT\u03bc\u03bd = \u03c1 h\u03bc\u03bd ;\n\nT\u03bc\u03bd = \u03c1 \u03b4 \u03bc\u03bd ,\n\n(93)\n\n(This approach was used first by E. Gliner [20, 21] in the seventies.) From (93) one is led\nto T00 = \u03c1 ;\n\nT11 = T22 = T33 = \u2212 P = \u03c1 ; and finally to \u03c1 + P = 0 . It must be emphasized\n\nthat inside the entity one has an enormous tension, making for the particle's stability.\nIn carrying out the models we started from the static spherically symmetric lineelements (13-15). The interior of neutral particles, considered in the present work, is\nfilled with induced matter of constant density being in the state of prematter. The first\nmodel (SEC. 4.) is carried out in the Einstein Gauge, \u03a9 = 1 , and the prematter substance\n~ of the Weyl length connection vector of the bulk. The\nis invoked by the component w\n0\nmatter density of this model is positive when the 5-th dimension is space-like (\u03b5 = \u22121) .\nIn the second model (SEC. 5.) the gauge function \u03c9 (r ) = ln \u03a9(r ) is chosen so that the\n~ \u2032 ) = const = 8\u03c0\u03c1 is invoked by the fifth\nmass density 8\u03c0\u03c1 = \u22128\u03c0P = 3\u03b5 e \u2212 (\u03bb +\u03c8 + 2\u03c9 ) (w\n4\n0\n\n~ ; this particle has a positive mass density for a timecomponent of the 5D Weyl vector w\n4\nlike fifth dimension (\u03b5 = 1) .\nIn both above-mentioned models 5, the filled by prematter interior is separated from the\nsurrounding vacuum by a spherical boundary surface of radius rb where e\u03bd = \u2212e \u2212 \u03bb = 0 .\nThe interior may be described as a closed de Sitter universe. Outside of the boundary\n\n( r > rb )\nM=\n\none has the Schwarzschild solution. For both models the mass is given as\n\n4\u03c0\n\u03c1 rb 3 and it is connected with the radius of the particle by the simple\n3\n\nrelation M =\n\n1\nrb .\n2\n\nIn SEC. 6, a model of charged particles was considered as a spherically symmetric\nentity filled with induced charged prematter in the brane. This entity is restricted by a\n5\n\nA recently published paper by Paul S. Wesson [8] as well a paper by S. Jalazadeh [25] may be noted in\nconnection with the phenomena discussed in the present work.\n\n24\n\n\fborder surface of radius rb so that beyond it one has vacuum. A special, very interesting\nanalytical solution for a plausible model was found. In the interior one has the metric\ny (r ) = e \u2212\u03bb = e\u03bd =\n\n1\n\u03c0\nsin 2 (kr ) with k \u2261\n, the prematter filling the interior is\nk r\nrb\n2 2\n\ncharacterized by a mass density and pressure-tension 8\u03c0 \u03c1 (r ) = \u22128\u03c0P(r ) = k 2 y (r ) and by\na charge density \u03c1 e = 2 \u03c1 , both vanishing (together with y (r ) ) at the border r = rb . In the\ncenter one has no singularities. In the interior acts the electric field given by\nw0\u2032 = \u2212\n\n\u03b5\nr\n\n2\n\n1\n\ne3\n\n(\u03c0 \u2212kr )\n\nq~ (r ) with q~ (r ) being the effective charge inside the sphere of radius r ,\n\nwhereas for r > rb one has w0\u2032 = \u2212\n\n\u03b5\nr2\n\nQ with Q = q~ (rb ) . Beyond the border surface\n\n2M Q 2\n( r > rb ) the well known Reissner-Nordstr\u00f8m metric y (r ) = 1 \u2212\n+ 2 is valid. It is\nr\nr\nshown that M = Q = rb , so that the exterior metric may also be written as\n2\n\n\uf8eb M\uf8f6\ny = \uf8ec1 \u2212 \uf8f7 ; r > rb and there is no black hole surrounding the particle.\nr \uf8f8\n\uf8ed\n\nIt is rather remarkable that there exist the considered analytic solution, and it is\nproposed that this be taken as describing models of classical charged fundamental\nparticles.\nThe particles presented in this paper may be considered as fundamental constituents of\nelementary particles (like quarks and leptons). These fundamental particles are\ncharacterized by their charge being 0 ; \u00b1 13 e , with e - the electron charge, as well by\nradius and mass. It is assumed that every quark or lepton is made up of three of these\nparticles. For the neutral particle the relation M neutral =\n\n1\nrb is obtained, whereas for the\n2\n\ncharged fundamental particle M ch arg ed = rb is holding. One would expect them to belong\nto the same family and to have some properties in common. It may be that the charged\nand the neutral particles have the same value of mass M ch arg ed = M neutral , or it may be\nthey have the same radius, so that M ch arg ed = 2 M neutral . It may also be that there are two\n\n25\n\n\fneutral particles with each of these masses; although from the aesthetic point of view it\nseems desirable to have as few different fundamental particles as possible.\n\nAPPENDIX\nThe metric tensors as given in EQ-s (13), (14) are\nh00 = e\u03bd ; h11 = \u2212e \u03bb ; h22 = \u2212 r 2 ; h33 = \u2212 r 2 sin 2 \u03b8\n~\n\n(A-1)\n\n~\n\n~\n\ng 00 = e N (r ,l ) \u2261 e N (l )h00 ; g11 = \u2212e L (r .l ) = e L (l )h11 ; g 22 = h22 ; g 33 = h33 ; g 44 = \u03b5 e F (A-2)\nThe basis that accords to (A-1, -2) may be written as\ne0A = e\n\n\u2212 12 N\n\ne1A = 0 , e\n\n1\n\n, 0 , 0 , 0 , 0.\n\u2212 12 L\n\nN\n\ne 0A = e 2 , 0 , 0, 0, 0.\n1\n\n, 0 , 0 , 0.\n\nL\n\ne1A = 0, e 2 , 0, 0, 0.\n\ne2A = 0, 0, 1, 0, 0.\n\ne A2 = 0, 0,1 , 0, 0.\n\ne3A = 0, 0, 0, 1, 0.\n\ne 3A = 0, 0, 0, 1, 0.\n1\n\n~\nF\n\nn A = 0, 0, 0, 0, \u03b5 e 2 .\n\nn A = 0, 0, 0, 0, e\n\n(A-3)\n~\n\u2212 12 F\n\n.\n\nHereafter a dot will denote partial differentiation with respect to l , while a prime will\nstand for the partial derivative with respect to r .
