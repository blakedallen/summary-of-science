Introduction\nOur increasingly precise knowledge of the evolution of the universe, condensed in the \u039bCDM\nmodel, has confirmed inflation as a cornerstone of modern cosmology. This was an epoch\nof accelerated, deSitter (dS) expansion in the distant past. There is also strong\nobservational evidence that the universe is entering a second phase of accelerated\nexpansion today, suggesting a positive vacuum energy at present [1].\nIt would be desirable that this progress in the area of cosmology were matched by\nanalogous developments on the Particle Physics side. The outstanding problem there\nis the development of a consistent quantum theory of the fundamental interactions that\nwould explain cosmological observations. It is widely believed that string theory fulfils\nall necessary requirements to become such fundamental theory, but there are a number of\ntechnical issues that are hampering progress. In particular, it is very difficult to find stable\ndS vacua, which is directly related to the problem of moduli stabilisation.\nRecently, we have witnessed outstanding progress in this area, perhaps best represented\nby the results of Kachru et al. [2], known from now on as KKLT. They devised a method\nfor constructing dS vacua through a combination of D-branes, fluxes and non-perturbative\neffects, which we will explain in detail in the next section, as a preamble to our work.\nThe idea was, in the context of Type IIB theory, to stabilise most of the moduli by fluxes\nat a high scale, and to write down an effective low-energy theory for the remaining, so\nfar flat, T -modulus. These would be stabilised by adding non-perturbative effects to the\nsuperpotential. The resulting vacuum happens to be purely supersymmetric (SUSY) and\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n\fanti deSitter (AdS). The idea, then, is to add the effect of anti D3-branes to the model,\nwhich would act as an extra piece in the potential, breaking SUSY explicitly and uplifting\nthe vacuum to dS.\nThere are a number of issues raised about this mechanism and its successful implementation within a realistic string model. In particular, the explicit supersymmetry breaking\nintroduced by the anti D3-brane makes it difficult to compute corrections reliably, so it\nwould be desirable to obtain dS vacua without explicit SUSY breaking. A suggestion by\nBurgess et al. [3], BKQ from now on, consisted of dropping the anti-D3 branes and considering D-terms coming from an anomalous U(1) instead. In favourable conditions the\nD-terms could act as an uplifting potential. This approach was subsequently criticised by\nChoi et al. [4] and de Alwis [5]. Quoting old results in Supergravity, a model with vanishing\nF-terms must have also vanishing D-terms. Therefore it is imperative that, in order for\nthe D-term to act as an uplifting potential, the F-terms have to necessarily break SUSY\n(which was not the case for BKQ).\nIt is this whole issue that we want to address in the present letter. We will reconcile\nthe results of BKQ, on the one hand, and Choi and de Alwis on the other, by exploiting the\nneed for the superpotential to be gauge invariant once an anomalous U(1) is considered in\nthe model. We will show that a gauge invariant version of BKQ can lead to stable dS vacua\nwith realistic values of the parameters in specific examples of Type IIB compactifications.\nThe paper is organised as follows: in section 2, we give a comprehensive review of the\nstructure of the KKLT mechanism and the subsequent proposal of BKQ. In sections 3 and\n4 we look at the consequences of implementing gauge invariance in a consistent way. In\nsection 5 we give a summary of the anomaly cancellation conditions one has to take into\naccount to work out consistent examples. In section 6 we present viable examples in the\ncontext of Type IIB theory and, in section 7, we conclude.\n\n2. Background\nAs already mentioned in the introduction, KKLT found an explicit way to construct 4D de\nSitter solutions of string theory. Their proposal was to use background fluxes for both NS\nand RR forms to fix the complex-structure moduli of a Calabi-Yau compactification in the\ncontext of Type IIB theory. They considered just one overall K\u00e4hler modulus, T , not fixed\nby the fluxes, which they stabilise through non-perturbative effects. In the language of N=1\nSupergravity (SUGRA), this is equivalent to considering a model with K\u00e4hler potential\nK = \u22123 log(T + T\u0304 ) ,\n\n(2.1)\n\nW = W0 + Ae\u2212aT .\n\n(2.2)\n\nand superpotential\n\nW0 is an effective parameter, coming from having integrated out all complex-structure\nmoduli through the use of fluxes [6], and A, a are constants. The non-perturbative superpotential is either generated by Euclidean D3-branes or by gaugino condensation [7, 8, 9] in\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n\fa non-abelian sector of N wrapped D7-branes. Notice here that the gauge kinetic functions\nin the effective SUGRA theory are given (up to O(1) factors, see sect. 5 below) by\nfa =\n\nT\n.\n2\u03c0\n\n(2.3)\n\nThe corresponding scalar potential [given just by the F-part, VF , see eqs (2.8) below] has\na SUSY-preserving, AdS minimum for T , which thus gets stabilised, but at a negative\nenergy. In order to promote these AdS vacua to dS vacua, the authors add anti D3-branes\nto the construction, which they quantify in terms of a new piece in the potential, namely\nV = VF +\n\nk\n,\nTR2\n\n(2.4)\n\nwhere k is a constant and TR = Re T . If k acquires a suitable value, then this term\ncan uplift the AdS vacuum obtained just with VF . Notice that the k/TR2 piece breaks\nsupersymmetry explicitly which, besides aesthetic reasons, complicates the analysis and\nreduces our control over the effective theory.\nIn ref. [3] BKQ proposed an attractive variation of KKLT to avoid such shortcomings.\nNamely, instead of anti D3-branes, they considered the possibility of turning on fluxes\nfor the gauge fields living on D7-branes. These fluxes would, in turn, generate a FayetIliopoulos (FI) term in the 4D effective action of the form\n\u03c0\n1\nVD = 2 D 2 =\nTR\n2gYM\n\nX\nE\n+\nqi |\u03c6i |2\nTR\nI\n\n!2\n\n,\n\n(2.5)\n\n2 , E is some constant arising from non-trivial fluxes for the gauge fields\nwhere TR = 2\u03c0/gYM\nliving on the D7-branes, \u03c6i are the scalar components of the chiral superfields, except T ,\nand qi are the corresponding charges under the anomalous U(1)X group. The previous\nequation assumes a minimal K\u00e4hler potential for \u03c6i , which is clearly a simplification, but\nit does not affect crucially the results.\nThe next assumption of BKQ is that (at the minimum) all h\u03c6i i = 0. They argue\nthat this can arise in two different ways: if the qi charges are such that the above D-term\ncannot be cancelled, it is reasonable to assume that the \u03c6i fields will settle at the origin\nto minimise V . As the authors admit, this \"non-cancellability\" is a crucial assumption\nwhich, so far, has not proved to be realised in practice. Alternatively, if the superpotential\ndoes not depend on the \u03c6i fields [as happens in eq. (2.2)], then the corresponding F-term\ncontributions to the potential, |Di W |2 \u223c |\u03c6i W |2 may be efficient to render \u03c6i = 0 at the\nminimum. In either case, they can replace\n\nVD \u223c\n\n\u03c0E 2\n,\nTR3\n\n(2.6)\n\nwhich has a form similar to the non-SUSY potential suggested by KKLT in (2.4) and,\nindeed, can work as an uplifting term: by adding the piece (2.6) with an appropriate value\nof E to the VF potential, the initial KKLT AdS minimum becomes a dS vacuum, as desired.\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\n\fThe results of BKQ have been criticised by Choi et al. [4] (and also in ref. [5]). Their\nargument is based on the simple relation between the value of the D-terms and the F-terms\nin a (D=4, N=1) SUGRA theory, namely\nDa =\n\ni\n1 I\n\u03b7 DI W ,\nRe(fa ) W a\n\n(2.7)\n\nwhere \u03a6I are the chiral superfields, \u03b7aI (\u03a6) denote their gauge transformation, \u03b4\u03a6I = \u01eba \u03b7aI (\u03a6)\n(\u01eba are the infinitesimal parameters of the transformation), D a = i\u03b7aI KI /Re(fa ), and DI\nis the K\u00e4hler derivative: DI W = \u2202I W + (\u2202I K)W . (XI \u2261 \u2202I X = \u2202X/\u2202\u03a6I , as usual).\nEq. (2.7) is valid at any point in field space (i.e. not necessarily at the minimum of\nthe potential), except where W = 0, and can be easily proved using the gauge invariance\nof W and the general form of the F-part and the D-part of the scalar potential, given by\n\u0011\n\u0010\n \u0304\nVF = eK K I J DI W DJ \u0304W\u0304 \u2212 3|W |2 ,\nVD =\n\n \u0304\n\n\u00012\n1\n1\nRe(fa )D a D a =\ni\u03b7aI KI\n.\n2\n2Re(fa )\n\n(2.8)\n\n(K I J is the inverse of the KI J \u0304 = \u2202 2 K/\u2202\u03a6I \u2202 \u03a6\u0304J matrix.) As mentioned above, when just\nthe F-part of the KKLT potential (which coincides with the BKQ one) is minimised, the\nAdS SUSY-preserving minimum is at DT W = 0, W 6= 0. If one then plugs VD in, as\ndone by BKQ, eq. (2.7) guarantees that that point in field space is still stationary with\nD = VD = 0. Hence adding VD does not lift the AdS minimum.\nMore generally, it is clear that, if the set of equations DI W = 0 can be solved simultaneously, this corresponds to an AdS (if W 6= 0) SUSY minimum. Then the previous\nargument applies and VD does not act as an uplifting potential 1 .\nThe results of BKQ and the argument of Choi et al. seem contradictory in appearance:\nif Choi et al. are right, BKQ should not have found an uplifted dS minimum once the VD\npiece is added. This contradiction is solved once gauge invariance is properly implemented,\nas we discuss in the next section.\n\n3. Implementation of gauge invariance and its consequences\nFrom the general form of VD in (2.8), it is clear that a FI term such as that of eq. (2.5)\nT 6= 0. More precisely, from\nimplies that the T modulus is charged under U(1)X , that is, \u03b7X\neqs (2.5) and (2.8), we can write the auxiliary DX field as\n!\nX\nE\n2\n2 I\nDX = \u2212gX\n\u03b7a KI ,\n(3.1)\n+\nqi |\u03c6i |2 = igX\nTR\nI\n\nimplying\nT\n\u03b7X\n\u2261i\n\n\u22122iE\n\u03b4GS\n=\n.\n2\n3\n\n1\n\n(3.2)\n\nHowever, even in that case there could still be local dS minima, which might be good enough for\nphenomenological purposes; this might also work just without the aid of any VD potential or similar.\n\n\u20134\u2013\n\n\fThis indicates that the non-perturbative superpotential term Ae\u2212aT in (2.2) is not U(1)X\ngauge invariant 2 , which is the reason why the BKQ potential does not obey the Choi et\nal. argument 3 . The implementation of gauge invariance turns out to be crucial, not only\nfor the consistency of the approach, but also for the qualitative features of the results. We\nwill see also that many interesting characteristics of the potential and its minima can be\npredicted just on grounds of gauge invariance.\nThe analysis of this section and the next one, although described in terms of the Type\nIIB set-up used by KKLT and BKQ, is valid for any SUGRA model, in particular for those\ncoming from heterotic string constructions.\nThe first step is to write the K\u00e4hler potential and the superpotential in a gaugeinvariant form. For the K\u00e4hler potential, K, we follow the usual prescription\nK = \u22123 log(T + T\u0304 )\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\nK = \u22123 log(T + T\u0304 + \u03b4GS V ) ,\n\n(3.3)\n\nT\nwhere i \u03b4GS\n2 \u2261 \u03b7X and V is the U(1)X vector superfield, while the non-perturbative superpotential should be written as\n\nWnp = Ae\u2212aT\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\nWnp = J(\u03c6i )e\u2212aT ,\n\n(3.4)\n\nwhere J(\u03c6i ) is an analytic function transforming under U(1)X just opposite to e\u2212aT , i.e.\nJ(\u03c6i ) \u2192 eia\u03b4GS /2 J(\u03c6i ), and invariant under the other gauge groups 4 .\nThe first conclusion is that one of the alternative assumptions of BKQ to get h\u03c6i i = 0,\nnamely to suppose W 6= W (\u03c6i ), cannot occur in practice. Next, we analyse the other\nalternative, i.e. the possible non cancellability of the FI potential due to the signs of the\nU(1)X charges, which is an interesting problem on its own.\nA sufficient condition for the cancellability of the D-terms in a supersymmetric the \u0303 i ), invariant under all the\nory [12, 13, 14] is the existence of an analytic function, J(\u03c6\ngauge groups except the anomalous U(1)X , and having an anomalous charge with sign\nopposite to the \u03c6i -independent term in DX , i.e. E/TR in eq. (3.1). Now, from the above\ntransformation properties of J(\u03c6i ) (assuming positive a, as usual) and eq. (3.2), it is clear\n \u0303 i)\nthat J(\u03c6i ) precisely fulfils the previous requirements, i.e. we can identify J(\u03c6i ) \u2261 J(\u03c6\nin eq. (3.4). This means that there is a set of h\u03c6i i values that cancel all the D-terms,\nincluding the anomalous one. In other words, the BKQ assumption that the anomalous FI\n2\n\nActually, BKQ mentioned this point in their article but, for simplicity, they did not attempt to incorporate gauge invariance in the analysis.\n3\nIf the U(1) symmetry is a (gauged) R-symmetry, the non-perturbative superpotential can transform\nwith the correct phase under a U(1) transformation. Then the FI term is purely constant [10]. Notice,\nhowever, that the constant W0 in eq. (2.2) does not transform (as it should). The possibility of using a\nU(1) R-symmetry of this kind, with W0 = 0, to get dS vacua, thanks to the interplay between VF and VD ,\nhas been explored in ref. [11].\n4\nIncidentally, notice that an exponential for the T -superpotential is essentially the only functional form\nthat can be made gauge invariant by the action of the matter superfields (which transform as a phase\nunder U(1)X ), which is a remarkable fact. Note also that for W0 6= 0 the only option consistent with\ngauge invariance is is to make W and K separately gauge invariant (rather than invariant up to K\u00e4hler\ntransformations).\n\n\u20135\u2013\n\n\fterm cannot be cancelled is not consistent with the presence of a non-perturbative analytic\nsuperpotential.\nThe apparent conclusion from the previous paragraphs is that the BKQ proposal of\nusing FI terms to uplift the potential is definitely hopeless. However, things are more subtle\nin practice. Wnp is typically an effective superpotential, so its analyticity does not need\nto be guaranteed in the whole range of the \u03c6i fields. Actually, this is the case when Wnp\nis originated by gaugino condensation. For example, for SU(N ) with Nf \"quark\" pairs,\n(ef f )\n{Qj , Q\u0304j }, Wnp\nis as in eq. (3.4) with [15, 16]\n\u22121\n\nJ(\u03c6) = (N \u2212 Nf )(det M 2 ) N\u2212Nf ,\n\n(3.5)\n\nwhere (M 2 )ij = 2Qi Q\u0304j . The important point is that the exponent of det M 2 in eq. (3.5)\nis negative (at least for Nf < N ). Therefore, J(\u03c6) cannot play the role of the analytic\n \u0303\nfunction J(\u03c6)\nin the above condition for the cancellation of the D-terms. J(\u03c6)\u22121 (or,\nmore precisely, J(\u03c6)\u2212(N \u2212Nf ) \u223c det(QQ\u0304)) might do it, but it has the wrong sign for the\n(ef f )\ncancellation of DX . In consequence, with this Wnp\nit is possible, in principle, that the\nDX term cannot be cancelled by any choice of h\u03c6i i. This rescues the BKQ assumption.\nNevertheless, even in this case, the fact that Wnp depends crucially on \u03c6i alters significantly the BKQ analysis. In particular, h\u03c6i i cannot be simply approximated by zero (which\npresents a singularity) or replaced by a constants in Wnp . As will be clear in sect. 6, these\nfields contribute their own (sizeable) part to the effective potential and cannot be ignored\nfor minimisation issues. Consequently, the BKQ analysis must be redone incorporating the\n\u03c6i fields. We leave this task for section 6 and discuss next other relevant implications of\ngauge invariance.\n\n4. Further implications for gaugino condensation and FI terms\nWe have just seen that a non-perturbative superpotential produced by gaugino condensation may be compatible with a non-cancellable anomalous FI term, thus rescuing the\nBKQ hypothesis. It is interesting, however, to point out the circumstances under which\nthis cannot happen.\nFirst of all, it is quite obvious that, if the condensing group has no matter representations, the condensing superpotential is not only incompatible with a non-cancellable FI\nterm, but with the existence of a FI term at all 5 . This occurs because the presence of the\nFI term indicates a non-trivial transformation of the T -field, which can only be compensated in the non-perturbative superpotential (3.4) by the transformation of J(\u03c6), which is\na function of the matter representations, as given in eq. (3.5).\nSecond, if the fields transforming under the condensing group are massive, gaugino\ncondensation will be again incompatible with a non-cancellable FI term. By 'massive'\nwe mean that the superpotential contains operators with the form of a mass term, with\n5\n\nBlanco-Pillado et al. [17] have argued that, in the presence of D- anti D-brane pairs, the four dimensional\neffective action should also include a constant FI term coming from the tension of the branes. Here we do\nnot consider such a possibility.\n\n\u20136\u2013\n\n\f(generically) field-dependent masses. For example, ordinary Yukawa operators are mass\nterms from this point of view. Since in the gaugino condensation literature the massive\ncase is very common, it is appropriate to discuss this point more in depth. Working again\nwith SU(N ) with Nf {Q, Q\u0304} pairs, if these fields are massive the superpotential contains\na term\nW \u2283 [M(A)]ij Qi Q\u0304j ,\n\n(4.1)\n\nwhere A represents other chiral fields (with possible VEVs, but this is not relevant in the\nfollowing discussion). The gauge invariance of W implies that det[M(A)] transforms under\nU(1)X exactly opposite to det[QQ\u0304] \u221d det M 2 . Therefore we can simply use det[M(A)] as\n \u0303\nthe J(\u03c6)\nfunction of the cancellation condition [its charge has the correct sign under U(1)X ].\nThis guarantees the existence of hAi values cancelling the FI D-term.\nThis statement is confirmed by the fact that, in the massive case, the chiral superfields\n(ef f )\nreads [16, 18, 19]\ncan be integrated out, so that Wnp\n1\n\n(ef f )\n\u221d [det M(A)] N e\u2212aT .\nWnp\n\n(4.2)\n\nThis has the form (3.4), with J(\u03c6) similar to eq. (3.5), but now with a positive expo \u0303\nnent. Therefore we can use det M(A) as the analytic J(\u03c6)\nfunction of the D-cancellation\n6\ncondition .\nOn the other hand, many authors have argued that the limit m \u2192 0 is singular [16], or\nit leads to the dissappearance of an effective supersymmetric superpotential [15]. According\nto that, it could seem that the only acceptable case is the massive case and, in consequence,\nwe would be back to the strong statement that the D-term must be neccesarily cancelled\nby some choice of h\u03c6i i. However, as we discuss next, those arguments can be revisited to\nsee that the formulation with massless matter is not problematic in this case.\nBased on arguments related to the Witten index for global SUSY [20, 21], the authors\nof the previous references have argued that the m \u2192 0 case cannot be described by a\nnon-trivial superpotential with SUSY preserving vacuum. In particular, for a large class\nof global SUSY scenarios, Affleck et al. [15] have shown that, for m \u2192 0, the minimisation\nof the potential leads to DM W \u2192 0, and hence to M 2 \u2192 \u221e (run-away behaviour) and\nWnp \u2192 0. This indicates that there is no effective SUSY superpotential describing the\ncondensation of gauginos in that case, which is consistent with the mentioned general\nexpectations.\nIn our case we have some differences with the previous scenarios: a Supergravity\nframework, the presence of the constant flux piece, W0 , and the dependence on the T -field.\nAlthough we see the mentioned behaviour in the global SUSY limit, in the complete case\nthings are different. Now we have two conditions for preserving SUSY, DM W = 0 and\nDT W = 0. If both could be satisfied at the same time, then we would have a SUSY\n(ef f )\n\n6\n\nfor a generic condensing group (not\nIt has been argued elsewhere [19] that the general form of Wnp\n2\n(ef f )\n\u221d [m(A)]3(1\u2212\u03b2\u0303/\u03b2) e\u22123/2g \u03b2 , where \u03b2 (\u03b2\u0303) is the \u03b2-function of\nnecessarily SU(N ) with Nf flavours) is Wnp\nthe gauge group with Nf (Nf = 0) flavours. Again the exponent is positive, guaranteeing the cancellation\nof the D-term.\n\n\u20137\u2013\n\n\fminimum. [Notice that this would not be changed by the inclusion of the FI term since,\nfrom eq. (2.7), this would cancel at that point.] Then, we would violate the Witten index\narguments, at least for a minimum with zero vacumm energy (notice that, for unbroken\nSUSY, this requires hW i = h\u2202I W i = 0, which includes the condition for unbroken SUSY in\nthe global limit). However, if the two conditions cannot be satisfied at the same time, then\nSUSY would be necessarily broken, recovering the agreement with the general arguments.\nSo we can have a consistent, non-singular, massless situation, provided SUSY is broken (by\nDM W 6= 0 and/or DT W 6= 0).\nIt is remarkable that the same conclusion can be reached using our arguments based\non the cancellability of the D-terms: if we are in a theory with a non-cancellable D-term\n(which, as argued, is only compatible with gaugino condensation in the massless matter\ncase), then the equations DI W = 0 (I running over all the chiral superfields) and W 6= 0\ncannot be fulfilled simultaneously. Otherwise we would have a paradox since, at that point,\nVD should also be zero because of eq. (2.7), but this is not possible by hypothesis. Therefore\nthe only way out is that either the set of equations DI W = 0 (i.e. DM W = 0 and DT W = 0\nin the simplest set-up) has no solution, which is the conclusion reached in the previous\nparagraph; or W \u2192 0, indicating a run-away behaviour and, therefore, the disappearance\nof the non-perturbative superpotential which describes the gaugino condensation.\nIn section 6, we will show explicitly with examples how these results take place in\npractice.\n\n5. Aspects of Type IIB and the Heterotic cases\nType IIB\nAs mentioned above, a relevant ingredient of the (Type IIB) set-up of KKLT is the presence of a SU(N ) condensing group arising from stacks of N D7-branes wrapped on some\n4-cycle of the Calabi-Yau space. It should be noticed here that for each SU(N ) there typically appears a U(1) factor [although this is not a strict rule]. Some of these U(1)s, or\ncombinations of them, can be anomalous.\nAlthough the discussion is easier in terms of an overall (K\u00e4hler) modulus, T , in general\nthere will be several relevant moduli, Ti , corresponding to the independent 4-cycles. The\ngauge kinetic functions of the different gauge groups, fa , are combinations of these moduli,\nwith coefficients that depend on the geometric structure of the associated 4-cycle. In other\nwords, the kinetic terms for the gauge superfields are of the form\nZ\n1 X (i)\nka Ti Wa\u03b1 Wa\u03b1 ,\n(5.1)\nL \u2283 d2 \u03b8\n8\u03c0\ni\n\n(i)\n\nwhere Wa\u03b1 is the field strength superfield of the Ga gauge group and ka are positive,\nO(1) model-dependent constants [22]. Note that eq. (5.1) includes axionic-like couplings\n(i)\n\u223c ka (Im Ti ) Fa F\u0303a . Likewise, there may be couplings of the Im Ti to RR\u0303 (R denoting the\n4D Riemann tensor) which depend on the particular geometrical structure of the model. As\n(i)\n\nusual, if the Ti -fields transform non-trivially, Ti \u2192 Ti + i\n\n\u20138\u2013\n\n\u03b4GS\n2 \u01eb,\n\nunder a particular U(1), say\n\n\fU(1)X , this will be reflected in the presence of Ti -dependent FI terms. The corresponding\n(i) (i)\ntransformation of the Lagrangian (5.1) is \u221d ka \u03b4GS Fa F\u0303a , which has to be compensated, if\ndifferent from zero, by the transformation arising from the [Ga ]2 \u00d7 U(1)X anomaly. This\nis the Green-Schwarz mechanism. More precisely, for Ga 6= U(1)X this requires\nX\n\n(i)\n\nka(i) \u03b4GS = \u2212\n\ni\n\n1X\nK(r)qX (r) ,\n\u03c0 r\n\n(5.2)\n\nwhere r runs over all the chiral superfields transforming under Ga , and K(r), qX (r) are\nthe corresponding representation index and U(1)X charge, respectively. For Ga = U(1)X\nthere is an extra (1/3) factor\nX\n\n(i) (i)\n\nkX \u03b4GS = \u2212\n\ni\n\n1 X 3\nqX ,\n3\u03c0\n\n(5.3)\n\nwhere the second sum runs over all the states. If Ga is a different U(1), say U(1)a , the (1/3)\n3 is replaced by q 2 q . Similarly, the mixed gauge-gravitational\nfactor disappears and qX\na X\nP\nanomaly, proportional to\nqX gets cancelled by the (model-dependent) couplings of the\nmoduli to RR\u0303. All the remaining gauge anomalies (e.g. U(1)1 \u00d7 U(1)2 \u00d7 U(1)X ) are\nvanishing.\nIf there is just one overall-modulus, T , the gauge group is typically SU(N ) \u00d7 U(1).\n(i)\n(i)\nFor several Ti , there can be many SU(N ) \u00d7 U(1) factors, with different values of ka , \u03b4GS .\nThe Standard Model gauge group could arise in this way from wrapped D7-branes or,\nalternatively, from stacks of D3-branes sitting at a point of the compactified space. In the\nlatter case the gauge coupling is given by the dilaton S, instead of T .\nIn summary, although conditions (5.2, 5.3) for anomaly cancellation must be fulfilled,\nand they are crucial for the consistency of the approach, there is a lot of freedom (i.e.\nmodel-dependence) for the possible values of the charges and the k(i) coefficients.\nLet us give, for future use, the relevant formulae for the overall modulus case and\nan SU(N ) \u00d7 U(1)X gauge group with Nf quark pairs, {Qj , Q\u0304j }, with charges q and q\u0304\nrespectively. For simplicity we willpconsider also an overall squark condensate |M |2 \u2261\n|M1 |2 = |M2 |2 = . . ., where Mi = 2Qi Q\u0304\u012b , with i = 1, . . . , Nf . We are assuming here\n|Qi |2 = |Q\u0304\u012b |2 \u2261 |Q|2 , which guarantees the cancellation of the SU(N ) D-term.\nThe K\u00e4hler potential and the gauge kinetic functions for this system are given (in Mp\nunits) by\nK = \u22123log(T + T\u0304 ) +\n\nNf\nX\ni=1\n\nfN =\n\n\u0001\n|Qi |2 + |Q\u0304\u012b |2 = \u22123log(T + T\u0304 ) + Nf |M |2 ,\nkN\nT,\n2\u03c0\n\nfX =\n\nkX\nT ,\n2\u03c0\n\n(5.4)\n\n(5.5)\n\nwhere kN , kX are O(1) positive constants. The previous equation assumes a minimal\nK\u00e4hler potential for Qi , Q\u0304i , which is a simplification, but not important for the present\ndiscussion, nor for the results of the next section.

Incidentally, note that (contrary to recent\nclaims [11]) there is no problem in having a 'racetrack' scenario [24, 25, 26, 27], i.e. several condensation superpotentials with different exponents, since all of them are rendered\ngauge-invariant thanks to the presence of matter fields.

Assuming that, beside the quarks,\nthere are no other matter fields with non-vanishing qX -charges, the anomaly cancellation\nconditions (5.10) read now, with an obvious notation,\n1\n1\nNf 1 (q1 + q\u03041 ) = 2 Nf 2 (q2 + q\u03042 )\n4\u03c0 2\n4\u03c0\nX\n1 X\n1\n3\n3\nN\nN\n(q\n+\nq\u0304\n)\n=\nNj Nf j (qj + q\u0304j ) .\n=\nj\nf\nj\nj\nj\n6\u03c0 2 kX\n48\u03c0 2\n\n\u2212\u03b4GS =\n\nj=1,2\n\nj=1,2\n\n\u2013 11 \u2013\n\n(5.13)\n\n\f(If there are extra fields, the modification of these relations is straightforward.) Then VD\nP\nP\nP\nP\nhas the form (5.11) with n qx = j=1,2 Nj Nf j (qj + q\u0304j ), n qx3 = j=1,2 Nj Nf j (qj3 + q\u0304j3 ).\nIt is worth-noticing that, in the absence of extra matter, the anomaly cancellation\ncondition forces N = 12, independently of the number of condensing groups. However,\neven in this case, a racetrack is possible, since the number of flavours can be different for\neach one.\n\n6. Examples in Type IIB\nWe will now illustrate explicitly the results of the previous sections, in particular the\nrealisation of uplifting D-terms in the context of (N=1, D=4) effective supergravities from\n(type IIB) string theory. The scenario can be considered as a simple, gauge invariant\nversion of the BKQ model which cures previous inconsistencies and allows for dS vacua.\n6.1 The structure of the scalar potential and SUSY breaking\nLet us consider the KKLT set-up with gaugino condensation as the origin of the nonrenormalisable superpotential. We will work in the simplest case of a single overall modulus,\nT , and SU(N )\u00d7U(1)X gauge group with Nf quark pairs, {Qj , Q\u0304j }, with anomalous charges\nq and q\u0304 respectively. We will also use an overall condensate |M |2 , as discussed in the\nprevious section. There could be a singlet \u03c6 as well, giving mass to the condensate but,\nas argued in section 4, we are omitting it in order to allow for a non-cancellable D-term 8 .\nThe K\u00e4hler potential and the gauge kinetic functions are thus given by eqs. (5.4, 5.5), and\nthe superpotential reads\nW = W0 + Wnp ,\n\n(6.1)\n\nwhere W0 is the effective constant superpotential triggered by the presence of fluxes and\nWnp is the gauge-invariant gaugino condensation superpotential, given by eq. (5.7) 9 . The\nscalar potential V = VF + VD can be explicitly written using the general formulae (2.8).\nIn particular, VD is given by eq. (5.8).\nLet us first show that this simple model breaks SUSY, both by F- and D-terms, which\nopens the possibility of a dS vacuum thanks to the VD contribution. The F-auxiliary\ncomponents of the T and M superfields are proportional to the K\u00e4hler derivatives. In this\ncase, FT (M ) = exp(K/2)DT (M ) W , with\nDT W = WT + KT W = \u2212\n\n3\n4\u03c0kN\nWnp \u2212\nW ,\nN \u2212 Nf\n2TR\n\nDM W = WM + KM W = \u2212\n\n2Nf M \u22121\nWnp + Nf M\u0304 W .\nN \u2212 Nf\n\n8\n\n(6.2)\n\nIn ref. [36] the issue of gauge invariance was addressed in the presence of massive matter condensates.\nThe resulting formalism was applied to the derivation of soft breaking terms, in particular to estimating\nthe contribution of the resulting D-term.\n9\nFor a detailed study of the interplay between both terms, including the origi of W0 , see ref. [37].\n\n\u2013 12 \u2013\n\n\fThe condition for unbroken SUSY by the previous F-terms is DT W = DM W = 0. One\ncan immediately see that this requires\nUnbroken SUSY \u21d2 |M |2 = \u2212\n\n3\n.\n4\u03c0kN TR\n\n(6.3)\n\nNotice that, substituting eq. (6.3) in VD [given by eq. (5.8)], and using the anomaly cancellation relation (5.6), makes VD cancel. This is a manifestation of the general connection\n(2.7) between F and D-terms. However, condition (6.3) cannot be fulfilled since the right\nhand side is negative definite. Therefore, whichever the minimum of VF be, it will correspond to a SUSY breaking point, with non vanishing VD . This breaking of SUSY by the\nF-terms is in contrast with the BKQ analysis, that did not consider the role of the matter\nfields to implement gauge invariance. On the other hand, if we had added an extra singlet\n\u03c6 to give mass to the quarks, VD would have become immediately cancellable. To see this,\nnotice that the charge of \u03c6 must have opposite sign to (q + q\u0304) (and thus to \u2212\u03b4GS ), so an\nappropriate VEV for \u03c6 is able to cancel VD . This confirms the results of section 4 concerning the impossibility of having a non-cancellable VD if the quark fields have effective\nmasses.\nLet us now investigate in more detail the structure of the scalar potential. For the\nremainder of this analysis it is particularly convenient to split the complex fields T and M\nin the following way\nT = TR + iTI ,\nM = |M |ei\u03b1M .\n\n(6.4)\n\nThen eqs (6.2) read\n3W0\n\u2212\nDT W = \u2212\n2TR\n\nDM W =\n\n\u0012\n\n3(N \u2212 Nf )\n+ 4\u03c0kN\n2TR\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\n2\n|M |2Nf\n\n\"\n\n\u0001\nNf\n|M |2 W0 + |M |2 (N \u2212 Nf ) \u2212 2\nM\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n1\nN\u2212Nf\n\n2\n|M |2Nf\n\n\u0013\n\ne\n\n\u22124\u03c0kN TR\nN\u2212Nf\n\n1\nN\u2212Nf\n\ne\n\ne\n\n\u22122i(Nf \u03b1M +2\u03c0kN TI )\nN\u2212Nf\n\n\u22124\u03c0kN TR\nN\u2212Nf\n\ne\n\n,\n(6.5)\n#\nT )\n\n\u22122i(Nf \u03b1M +2\u03c0kN I\nN\u2212Nf\n\nIt is now straightforward to write VF plugging these expressions into eq.

Depending on the signs of A and B, n even (odd) will correspond to a\nminimum (maximum) of VF or vice versa. These are also extrema of the whole V = VF +VD\npotential, since VD , as given by eq. (5.8), does not depend on \u03b1M , TI . Therefore, one can\nintegrate out one combination of these two real variables through eq. (6.9) (there is another\ncombination which is completely flat) and work with V (TR , |M |2 ) = VF + VD , with VF and\nVD given by eq. (6.6) [with the cosine = \u20131, which corresponds to the solution of minimum\nin our cases] and eq. (5.8) respectively.\nNext we explore the minimisation of this potential, searching for examples of dS vacua.\n6.2 Working examples. General characteristics\nLet us start by considering the previous set up with the following choice of parameters:\nN = 15, kN = 1, Nf =\np 1, q = q\u0304 = \u22122, W0 = 0.30. Incidentally, Nf = 1 means that\nthere is just one M = 2QQ\u0304 field, so we are not making any overall squark condensate\nassumption.\nThe total potential, VF + VD , as a function of the TR and |M |2 variables (the other\ntwo, \u03b1M , TI , have been integrated out as described above) is plotted in figure 1, where one\ncan see the existence of a positive (dS) minimum, as desired.

We have performed an\nanalysis of the Hessian matrix in all four variables to confirm that this is a real minimum\nof V .\nIt is perhaps more illustrative to show the contribution of each part of the potential\nseparately. In fig. 2 we show a contour plot of VF in the (TR , |M |2 ) plane.

The condition FT = 0 is also shown.\n\nsee that this potential has a minimum for TR = 5.99, |M |2 = 1.94 and VF = \u22120.00022.\nWe have also shown the condition FT = 0 to illustrate the fact that the F-term associated\nto the modulus does not break SUSY at this stage. However, the remaining F-term,\nFM , does break SUSY and, in fact, the line FM = 0 lies outside the boundaries of the\nfigure. Therefore, the F-part of the potential generates has a SUSY breaking minimum\nwith negative vacuum energy, as expected from the discussion of subsection 6.1.\nAs for VD , this is shown in fig. 3. Here we can see clearly that, along the |M |2 direction,\nthe minimum lies at |M |2 = 0, while there is a runaway direction along increasing TR . The\nsum of the two potentials is such that the minimum of VF + VD happens for similar values\nof TR as for VF , but for much smaller values of |M |2 . The interplay between VF and VD\nto generate a dS minimum can be well appreciated in fig. 4, where we have plotted VF , VD\nand V = VF + VD as a function of TR for |M |2 fixed at its value in the minimum of V .\nWe have found many more examples, with reasonable values of the parameters, where\nthis pattern is repeated. In table 1 we present a handful of successful cases, including\nthe one shown in the figures. The 'min' ('F min') subscript means that the quantity is\nevaluated at the minimum of V (VF ).\nA number of comments are in order:\n\u2022 The values found for TR are in the 5 \u2212 10 range (in Mp units), which is satisfactory\n> 1),\nfor the Supergravity approximation we are using to be valid (which requires TR \u223c\n\n\u2013 15 \u2013\n\n\f0.14\n\n0.1\n0.08\n\nR\n\nV (T ,|M|2)\n\n0.12\n\nD\n\n0.06\n0.04\n0.02\n0\n8\n7\n\n1\n6\n\n0.8\n0.6\n\n5\n\nTR\n\n0.4\n\n4\n\n|M|2\n\n0.2\n3\n\n0\n\nFigure 3: 3D plot of the D-potential, VD as a function of TR and |M |2 for the values of the\nparameters shown in the text.\n\n\u22124\n\n8\n\nx 10\n\n7\n\n6\n\nV(TR,|M|min)\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\nV +V\nF\n\n2\n\nD\n\n1\n\n0\n\n\u22121\n5.5\n\nVD\nVF\n6\n\n6.5\n\n7\n\nTR\n\n7.5\n\n8\n\n8.5\n\n9\n\nFigure 4: Plot of the F-potential, VF (red), the D-potential, VD (green) and the sum of both,\nVF + VD (blue), as a function of TR for the example shown in the text and |M |2 fixed to its value\nat the overall minimum.\n\nbut also from the phenomenological point of view. Notice here that the value of\n\u22122\n(Mstring ) up to O(1) model-dependent factors, called ka in\nTR corresponds to gYM\nsect. 5. If the Standard Model (SM) gauge group arises from wrapped D7-branes (as\nwe have assumed for the condensing gauge groups) and all ka = 1, then one should\nget TR \u223c 12. This is in fact not far from the values found in the examples of table\n1, where kN = 1 has been taken for the condensing group, but no assumption about\nthe ka factors of the SM gauge groups has been made. Therefore, playing with these\nO(1) factors, it is clear that the quoted values of TR are perfectly realistic.

Then, the value of TR does\nnot have a direct phenomenological meaning and, again, the presented examples are\nperfectly viable.\n\u2022 The value of W0 sets the overall scale of the F-potential, and, consequently, determines the scale of the non-perturbative potential, which has to be comparable in\nsize in order to create a minimum of VF . Given that W0 is an effective parameter,\ncoming from the flux stabilisation of the other moduli in the model, we treat it as\na phenomenological quantity and simply state the range of values for which we find\nsuitable minima, which, as can be seen from the table, is around W0 \u223c 0.3 (for both\nanomalous charges having the same sign). Smaller values of W0 result in a smaller\nmagnitude for VF which would imply that VD dominates and we lose the minimum.\nLarger values would result in a too large VF and the uplifting by VD would not be\nefficient enough.\n\u2022 Playing with the value of W0 one can find V = 0 (i.e. Minkowski) vacua, or adjust\nthe cosmological constant to an arbitrary small value. E.g. for the example shown\nin the figures we can tune W0 = 0.301566 to have a minimum at TR = 7.07, |M |2 =\n0.0019 and V = 1.10\u22129 . The value W0 = 0.301567 would already render a negative\nminimum. Roughly speaking each decimal place tuned in W0 reduces the value of V\nat the minimum by half an order of magnitude.\n\u2022 The small values of |M |2 allow, for the purpose of minimisation, to neglect |M |2\nin VD . In this way one exactly recovers the BKQ potential (2.6). However, this\ndoes not mean that one can simply replace |M |2 by a constant in Wnp and proceed\nas BKQ. The reason is that the contribution of the M -field to the VF potential,\neK |DM W |2 \u223c k/TR (where k is a constant), is sizeable and cannot be ignored in\nthe minimisation. Likewise, the dependence of V in both fields, T and M , may be\nrelevant to inflation.\n\u2022 To obtain TR > 1 at the minimum, a value of N \u2265 10 has to be assumed. This\nis due to the fact that the minimum for the F-potential comes from the interplay\n\n\u2013 17 \u2013\n\n\fbetween W0 and Wnp , which determines the order of magnitude of the exponent of\nWnp , 4\u03c0kN /(N \u2212 1), in terms of W0 and TR . Then, for the quoted size of W0 and\nTR > 5, N must be at least of order 12, as shown.\n\u2022 The values of the anomalous charges (q, q\u0304) affect the scale of the D-potential and\nmust, therefore, be balanced with the corresponding value of W0 for the uplifting\nmechanism to be efficient.\n\u2022 We have found FT \u223c 0 at the minimum of VF in all examples. This leads to a simple\nexpression for |M |2F min , given by\n\u0012\n\n2\n|M |2F min\n\n\u00131/(N \u22121)\n\n=\n\n3W0\n2TR\ne4\u03c0kN TR /(N \u22121)\n3(N \u22121)\n2TR + 4\u03c0kN\n\n.\n\n(6.10)\n\nFor the values of parameters considered one can check that the previous equation\nleads to a value of |M |2F min \u223c 2 which is remarkably stable. As commented before,\nthis value gets very suppressed once VD is added.\n\u2022 After adding the VD piece, both DT W and DM W 6= 0. Hence, SUSY becomes\nbroken by the T and M F-terms, and also by the D-term associated to U (1)X . The\ngoldstino field can be written as \u03b7 = cM M\u0303 + cT T\u0303 + c\u03bb \u03bbX , where T\u0303 , M\u0303 are the\n(canonically normalised) fermionic components of T , M , and \u03bbX is the (canonically\nnormalised) gaugino associated to U (1)X . For the example shown in the figures, the\ncoefficients {|cM |, |cT |, |c\u03bb |} are in the ratio {1 : 25 : 42}. The resulting gravitino\nmass is naturally too large for ordinary low-energy SUSY phenomenology. E.g. for\nthe same example as above, m3/2 = exp(K/2)W \u2243 Mp /177. This large m3/2 is due to\nthe magnitude of VD \u223c [O(Mp2 )/(4\u03c0 2 )]2 , which has to be comparable to the absolute\nsize of VF in order to uplift the AdS minimum, without destroying it. This may be a\nphenomenological shortcoming if one attempts to get conventional low-energy SUSY.\nWe leave some further comments on this issue for the conclusions.\nIn summary, playing with a constant superpotential (triggered by fluxes), a non-renormalizable\nsuperpotential originated by gaugino condensation, with quark representations, and an\nanomalous U (1) group with non-cancellable FI D-term (which, for gauge invariance consistency, requires the quarks to be massless), it is easy to find examples where an AdS\nminimum is produced by the F-potential, and subsequently uplifted to dS by the D-term.\nThere is no fine tuning in our results (unless one wishes to fine-tune the cosmological constant) and, in practice, this fixes the acceptable ranges for W0 and the rank of the gauge\ngroup.\n\n7. Conclusions\nIn this article we have revisited the proposal of BKQ [3] of using a supersymmetric D-term\npotential (namely a Fayet-Iliopoulos one) for the uplifting of the AdS minima found by\nKKLT [2] in the context of type IIB theory with fluxes. The BKQ suggestion has been\n\n\u2013 18 \u2013\n\n\fcriticised [4, 5] since, on general SUGRA grounds, a model with vanishing F-terms must\nhave also vanishing D-terms, which prevents the D-part of the potential (VD ) from uplifting\nthe SUSY-preserving minima of the F-part (VF ).\nFirst, we have reconciled the BKQ scenario with the general SUGRA arguments, by\nmaking the former gauge invariant. This requires the inclusion of matter fields, which\nplay a crucial role for the consistency of the approach. In this context we show that a\nnon-perturbative superpotential \u223c e\u2212aT (as required by the KKLT set up) produced by\ngaugino condensation is only consistent with a non-cancellable VD (as required by the\nBKQ proposal) if the relevant quark representations are massless. Then the minima of VF\nare necessarily SUSY-breaking, either by the moduli F-terms or by the matter ones, and\nthe uplifting by VD can in principle work. We discussed also the details of such effective\nSUGRA scenarios when they arise from type IIB or from the heterotic strings, paying\nspecial attention to the anomaly cancellation constraints.\nFinally, we illustrated and applied the previous results, by finding many examples of\neffective SUGRA models (which can arise from type IIB strings in the KKLT context),\nwhose potential has positive minima for reasonable values of the moduli and matter fields.\nThis shows how the uplifting by D-terms works in practice. Before adding the VD piece to\nthe potential, these examples have SUSY broken by the F-term associated to the matter\nfields, whereas FT \u223c 0. The minima are initially AdS and become dS after adding the\nD-terms. The corresponding values of the parameters that define the model lie within\nnatural ranges and are not fine tuned (unless one wishes a vanishing or extremely tiny\ncosmological constant, which is perfectly achievable).\nAt the minimum of the complete potential the breaking of SUSY is triggered both\nby the F-terms (i.e. FM , FT 6= 0) and by the anomalous D-term (DX 6= 0). The\ngravitino mass is O(10\u22122 Mp ), since the natural scale of VD (and hence of VF at the uplifted\nminimum) is [O(Mp /(4\u03c0 2 ))]2 . This large gravitino mass is an obstacle for conventional lowenergy SUSY (although it is OK for inflation), since it leads to O(m3/2 ) soft masses in the\nobservable sector, after gravity mediation of SUSY breaking. A possibility here is simply\nto give up low energy SUSY. However, a particularly appealing possibility arises from\nnoting that, although the scalar soft masses are naturally very large in this framework, the\n(observable) gaugino masses are vanishing at this stage if the SM gauge group arises from\nstacks of D3-branes sitting at a point of the compactified space (since T does not enter\nthe relevant gauge kinetic functions). It is amusing that this scenario (which, of course,\nwould get radiative corrections) corresponds to the assumptions of the so-called split-SUSY\nmodels [38, 39], whose possible existence and viability has been invoked precisely in the\ncontext of landscape frameworks, as those suggested by the KKLT set up re-visited here.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank A.
