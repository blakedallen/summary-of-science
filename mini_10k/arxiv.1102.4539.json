There are basic supergravities and deformed supergravities. Basic theories have no potential or mass terms in their Lagrangian. They\nare determined by supersymmetry and the kinetic terms. Basic theories with more than 16\nsupercharges have unique kinetic terms for every dimension D. Also the theories with 16\nsupercharges are completely fixed once D and the number of vector (or tensor) multiplets\ncoupled to supergravity are given. Basic theories with less than 16 supercharges have more\nfreedom. Here one still has the choice of adding different matter multiplets. In these cases\nthe model also depends on some functions that can vary by infinitesimal variations (e.g. a\nK\u00e4hler potential or a prepotential). All in all the basic supergravities are well understood\nand classified.\nAfter specifying D, N and (eventually) the matter multiplets there are still different\ntheories possible. These are deformations of the basic theories described above. The simplest\nexample of a deformation is the choice of a superpotential in D = 4, N = 1 supergravity.\nOther examples consist in the coupling to Yang-Mills type gauge groups (see for example [2])\nor the introduction of mass-parameters [3]. In this text we are concerned about the coupling\nto Yang-Mills type gauge groups, the so-called gauged supergravities. In the past ten years\na powerful technique has been developed to systematically study and classify these theories.\nThis technique is the embedding tensor formalism [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. If we want to obtain\na full classification of gauged supergravities it is necessary to thoroughly study the structure\nof this embedding tensor formalism.\nIn this text we will first give a short introduction to this formalism by applying it to a\ngeneric D = 4, N = 1 supergravity theory. Then we will study the structure of the resulting\ngauge algebra and conclude that it is soft, open and reducible. Since these are precisely the\nfeatures of the field-antifield formalism of Batalin and Vilkovisky1 [13], it is natural to use\nit to reformulate the embedding tensor formalism. This will be discussed in the last part of\nthe text.\n\nD = 4, N = 1 supergravity and conventional gauging\n\n2\n\nA generic ungauged D = 4, N = 1 supergravity has the following bosonic Lagrangian for its\ngauge and scalar fields\n1\ne\u22121 Ls + e\u22121 Lg.k. = \u2212g\u03b1\u03b2\u0304 \u2202\u03bc z \u03b1 \u2202 \u03bc z\u0304 \u03b2\u0304 \u2212 Ref\u03a3\u039b (z)F\u03bc\u03bd \u03a3 F \u03bc\u03bd \u039b\n4\n1 \u22121\n+ e Imf\u03a3\u039b (z)\u03b5\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 F\u03bc\u03bd \u03a3 F\u03c1\u03c3 \u039b .\n8\n1\n\nFor an introduction consult [11, 12].\n\n2\n\n(2.1)\n\n\fThe f\u03a3\u039b (z) are scalar dependent positive definite functions and the F\u03bc\u03bd \u039b (with \u039b = 1, . . . , n)\nare the (up to now) abelian field strengths. n is the number of vector fields. The scalar fields\nz \u03b1 parametrize a K\u00e4hler manifold with g\u03b1\u03b2\u0304 = \u2202\u03b1 \u2202\u03b2\u0304 K(z, z\u0304) the K\u00e4hler metric and K(z, z\u0304) the\nK\u00e4hler potential. There are no gauge couplings and no scalar potential. This Lagrangian\nhas only global symmetries and abelian gauge groups. The theory is determined completely\nby the gauge kinetic function f\u03a3\u039b (z) and the K\u00e4hler potential K(z, z\u0304).\nBefore we can switch on any gauge couplings, we need to determine the rigid (global)\nsymmetry group of the theory Grigid . This is the group of global transformations that leave\nthe total set of Bianchi identities and equations of motion of the theory unchanged but, in\ngeneral, do not leave the Lagrangian invariant2 . We know that the rigid symmetry group of\nthe vector sector is Sp(2n, R). On the other hand, the rigid symmetry group of the scalar\nsector is given by the isometry group of the scalar manifold Iso(Mscalar ). Hence we conclude\nthat, since the scalar and vector sectors are coupled via the gauge kinetic functions f\u03a3\u039b (z),\nthe rigid symmetry group of the full theory (scalar and vector sector)\nGrigid \u2286 Sp(2n, R) \u00d7 Iso(Mscalar ).\n\n(2.2)\n\nThe rigid symmetry group is determined by the gauge kinetic function f\u03a3\u039b (z) and the K\u00e4hler\npotential K(z, z\u0304).\nAs already mentioned above, Grigid does not necessarily leave the Lagrangian invariant.\nOnly a subgroup of Grigid leaves the Lagrangian unchanged and only this subgroup (or a\nsubgroup thereof) can, according to the method of conventional gauging, be promoted to\na gauge group. The method of conventional gauging is the following. Let us denote the\ngenerators of Grigid as \u03b4a , where [\u03b4a , \u03b4b ] = fab c \u03b4c with fab c the structure constants of Grigid .\nWe select a gauge group Ggauge \u2286 Grigid by choosing linear combinations of the \u03b4a\n\u03b4\u039b = \u0398\u039b a \u03b4a\n\n(2.3)\n\nthat leave the Lagrangian invariant. \u0398\u039b a is called the embedding tensor that determines\nthe embedding of Ggauge into Grigid and that satisfies a constraint ensuring closure of the\ngauge generators. We then promote the symmetries \u03b4\u039b to local ones by switching on gauge\ncouplings in covariant derivatives and non-abelian field strengths\nD\u03bc = \u2202\u03bc \u2212 gA\u03bc \u039b \u03b4\u039b ,\n\nF\u03bc\u03bd \u039b = 2\u2202[\u03bc A\u03bd] \u039b + gf\u03a3\u03a9 \u039b A\u03bc \u03a3 A\u03bd \u03a9 ,\n\n(2.4)\n\nwhere f\u03a3\u03a9 \u039b are the structure constants of Ggauge .\nThis method of conventional gauging brings along several problems obstructing our aim\nto systematically study all possible gaugings of the theory. First of all only electric couplings\nare possible (because only electric gauge fields A\u03bc \u039b appear in the covariant derivatives (2.4)).\nHence, this conventional gauging method already breaks the duality covariance of the set of\nfield equations and Bianchi identities. The second problem is that the possible gauge groups\ndepend on the symplectic frame since only subgroups of Grigid that leave the Lagrangian\ninvariant can be promoted to a gauge group. All this asks for a more general gauging\nmechanism. This will be provided by the embedding tensor formalism.\n2\n\nGrigid is also denoted as the group of electric/magnetic duality transformations.\n\n3\n\n\f3\n\nThe embedding tensor formalism\n\nTo solve the problems mentioned at the end of the previous section and hence provide a\nduality covariant method of gauging the 4 dimensional Lagrangian (2.1), one introduces\nmagnetic vector fields A\u03bc\u039b in addition to the usual electric ones A\u03bc \u039b . The A\u03bc\u039b are defined\nas follows\n\u03b4L\nG\u03bc\u03bd \u039b = 2\u2202[\u03bc A\u03bd]\u039b\nand\nG\u03bc\u03bd \u039b \u2261 \u03b5\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3\n.\n(3.1)\n\u03b4F\u03c1\u03c3 \u039b\nThese magnetic vectors are combined with the electric vectors in a symplectic vector\n\u0010\n\u0011\nA\u03bc M = A\u03bc \u039b , A\u03bc\u039b .\n(3.2)\nUnder the rigid symmetry group, the vectors transform as follows\n\u03b4(\u03bb)A\u03bc M = \u03bba \u03b4a A\u03bc M = \u2212\u03bba (ta )N M A\u03bc N ,\n\n(3.3)\n\nwhere the (ta )N M are the rigid symmetry generators in the vector representation3 . Also the\nembedding tensor is generalized to\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0398M a = \u0398\u039b a , \u0398\u039ba .\n(3.4)\nOnce the gauge generators \u03b4M have been selected through the choice of an embedding tensor\n\u03b4M = \u0398M a \u03b4a , one proceeds as usual by introducing a local parameter, \u039bM (x), for every generator and by constructing covariant derivatives. The gauge transformations of the vectors\nare\n\u03b4(\u039b)A\u03bc M = \u2202\u03bc \u039bM + gA\u03bc N XN P M \u039bP\n(3.5)\nwith XN P M \u2261 \u0398N a (ta )P M . Covariant derivatives are defined as\nD\u03bc = \u2202\u03bc \u2212 gA\u03bc M \u03b4M = \u2202\u03bc \u2212 gA\u03bc \u039b \u0398\u039b a \u03b4a \u2212 gA\u03bc\u039b \u0398\u039ba \u03b4a .\n\n(3.6)\n\nThe covariant derivatives can now contain electric and magnetic gauge fields, hence keeping\nthe duality covariance of the ungauged theory.\nOf course this duality covariance does not come for free. A consistent gauging requires\nthe imposition of a closure constraint on the embedding tensor. It has the following form\nfbc a \u0398M b \u0398N c + (tb )N Q \u0398M b \u0398Q a = 0.\n\n(3.7)\n\nThe definition of XN M P together with the closure constraint implies\n[XM , XN ] = \u2212XM N P XP ,\n\n(3.8)\n\nwhich can be interpreted as closure of the gauge algebra with XM N P as its generalized\nstructure constants. Equation (3.8) implies that X(N M ) P only vanishes upon contraction\n3\n\nThe matrices (ta )N M satisfy the symplectic condition (ta )(N M \u03a9P )M = 0, where \u03a9P M is the symplectic\nmetric.\n\n4\n\n\fwith the embedding tensor, but, in general, is not zero in itself. This signals a difference\nwith ordinary gauge groups, where the structure constants are antisymmetric and satisfy a\nJacobi identity. In our case the Jacobi identity is violated4 by terms that are proportional\nto X(N M ) P .\nIn order to maintain gauge covariance of the theory it is required to introduce several new\ningredients (which will seriously complicate the gauge structure of the theory). We will now,\nvery schematically, introduce these necessary ingredients. For a more thorough discussion\nwe refer to [10, 14, 1].\n\u2022 The first step towards gauge covariance is the introduction of extra gauge transformations for the vector fields, accompanied by new local parameters \u039e\u03bc N P (x):\n\u03b4(\u039b)A\u03bc M \u2192 \u03b4(\u039b, \u039e)A\u03bc M = \u03b4(\u039b)A\u03bc M + \u03b4(\u039e)A\u03bc M ,\n\n(3.9)\n\n\u03b4(\u039e)A\u03bc M = \u2212X(N P ) M \u039e\u03bc N P .\n\n(3.10)\n\nwhere\nThese new transformations, proportional to X(M N ) P , are introduced to gauge away the\ndirections in the algebra that violate the Jacobi identity.\n\u2022 The next step in the construction of the theory is the introduction of covariant field\nstrengths for the vectors. The usual expression, F\u03bc\u03bd M = 2\u2202[\u03bc A\u03bd] M + X[N P ] M A\u03bc N A\u03bd P ,\ndoes not transform covariantly but picks up terms that are proportional to X(N P ) M .\nTherefore, we will introduce new field strengths,\nH\u03bc\u03bd M \u2261 F\u03bc\u03bd M + X(N P ) M B\u03bc\u03bd N P ,\n\n(3.11)\n\nand new 2-forms B\u03bc\u03bd N P . The gauge transformations of these 2-forms are fixed by\ndemanding the covariant transformation of the new field strengths H\u03bc\u03bd M\n\u03b4(\u039b, \u039e)B\u03bc\u03bd N P = 2D[\u03bc \u039e\u03bd] N P + 2A[\u03bc (N \u03b4A\u03bd] P ) \u2212 2\u039b(N H\u03bc\u03bd P ) .\n\n(3.12)\n\n\u2022 Realising this duality covariant gauging method at the level of the action (2.1) requires\nseveral modifications. First of all the field strengths F\u03bc\u03bd \u039b in Lg.k. need to be replaced\nby the generalized ones H\u03bc\u03bd \u039b and the derivatives in Ls need to be replaced by the\ncovariant ones (3.6). Gauge invariance also requires the addition of Chern-Simons\nterms for the vectors, denoted by LGCS , and topological terms for the 2-forms, denoted\nby Ltop,B . We will denote the full Lagrangian as\nL0 = Lg.k. + LGCS + Ltop,B + Ls .\n4\n\nInstead a generalized Jacobi identity is valid:\nXQR M X(N P ) R \u2212 X(RP ) M XQN R \u2212 X(N R) M XQP R = 0.\n\n5\n\n(3.13)\n\n\fThe full expression for this modified Lagrangian can be found in [10]. In [10, 15] it\nwas pointed out that, in the presence of an action, (3.12) needs to be modified to\n\u03b4(\u039b, \u039e)B\u03bc\u03bd N P = 2D[\u03bc \u039e\u03bd] N P + 2A[\u03bc (N \u03b4A\u03bd] P ) \u2212 2\u039b(N G\u03bc\u03bd P ) ,\n\n(3.14)\n\nwhere G\u03bc\u03bd M = (H\u03bc\u03bd \u039b , G\u03bc\u03bd\u039b ), with G\u03bc\u03bd \u039b \u2261 \u03b5\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 \u2202H\u2202L\n\u039b.\n\u03c1\u03c3\nTo summarize, we have an action (3.13) that is invariant5 under the gauge transformations\n(3.9) and (3.14) and some nonlinear transformations of the scalars which are not important\nin the rest of our discussion.\n\n4\n\nStructure of the gauge algebra\n\nFrom the previous section it is clear that there is a price we pay for the duality covariance\nof the gauged theory: the gauge structure becomes increasingly complicated. We had to\nintroduce new types of gauge transformations and new 2-form gauge fields. Had we chosen\na theory with D > 4 to illustrate the embedding tensor formalism, then the gauge structure\nwould become even more complicated. More higher-form gauge fields and hence more types of\ngauge transformations would have to be introduced to ensure gauge covariance. An explicit\ndiscussion about this hierarchy of form-fields and gauge transformations can be found in\n[14, 16, 17].\nIn this section we will discuss the structure of the gauge algebra of the N = 1, D = 4\ntheory. We expect that this structure can be extended to theories with a more complex\ntensor hierarchy. For an explicit discussion see [1].\n\u2022 The gauge algebra is open: the commutator of two gauge transformations6 (\u039b-, \u039eand/or \u03a6- type) contains, in addition to a linear combination of transformations, terms\nthat are proportional to the field equations (from the Lagrangian (3.13)).\n\u2022 The gauge algebra is soft: the structure 'constants' are field-dependent. In our case,\nthe non-zero commutators are f\u039b\u039b \u039b , f\u039e\u039e \u03a6 , f\u039b\u039b \u039e , f\u039b\u039b \u03a6 , f\u039b\u039e \u03a6 , from which the latter\nthree are all field dependent.\n\u2022 The gauge algebra is reducible: the different gauge transformations are not all independent, there are zeromodes. Let us give an example here. The gauge transformation\nof the vector A\u03bc M is\nP\n\u03b4A\u03bc M = \u2202\u03bc \u039bM + A\u03bc N XN P M \u039bP \u2212 X(N P ) M \u039eN\n\u03bc .\n\n(4.1)\n\nThis transformation vanishes for an appropriate choice of the parameters \u039b and \u039e :\n\u039bM = X(RS) M \u039bRS\n\nand\n\n\u039e\u03bc N P = \u2202\u03bc \u039bN P + 2A\u03bc Q XQR (N \u039bP )R ,\n\n5\n\n(4.2)\n\nInvariance requires also a second constraint to be imposed on the embedding tensor. This is the so-called\nlinear constraint: X(M N P \u03a9Q)P = 0.\n6\nClosure of the gauge algebra also requires a third type of gauge transformations (\u03a6-type), only working\non the two-forms.\n\n6\n\n\fwith7 \u039bRS = \u039bSR an arbitrary local parameter. This specific choice of the parameters\n\u039bM and \u039e\u03bc N P corresponds to a zero mode of the theory which is parametrized by \u039bRS .\n\u2022 The gauge algebra is also higher stage reducible: the different zeromodes are not all\nindependent. There are zeromodes for the zeromodes. These second stage zeromodes\nalso turn out not to be independent: there are again zeromodes for these second stage\nzeromodes and so on.\nHence, the gauge algebra related to the embedding tensor formalism is soft, open and reducible. These are precisely the features for which the field-antifield formalism [13] was\ndesigned. The original aim of this formalism was to provide a method to quantize general\ngauge theories but - and this is the main reason why it is used in [1] - it also provides a very\nconcise way to write down the gauge structure of a classical theory into one master equation.\n\n5\n\nThe field-antifield formalism\n\nThe main ingredients of the field-antifield formalism are the following\n0\n\u2022 The 'classical' fields \u03c6i \u2261 {A\u03bc M , B\u03bc\u03bd M N } are completed with ghosts ca(0)\n(corresponding\na1\nto the gauge transformations), ghost for ghosts c(1) (corresponding to the first stage\nzeromodes) and so on (see table 1). Let us call all these fields \u03c7n \u2261 {\u03c6i , c(0) a0 , c(1) a1 , . . .}.\nFor all the fields \u03c7n also an additional antifield \u03c7\u2217n is introduced.\n\nfields \u03c6i\nghosts c(0) a0\nc(1) a1\n..\n.\n\nM\n\nc(0)\nc(1) M N\n..\n.\n\nA\u03bc M\nc(0)\u03bc M N\nc(1)\u03bc M N P\n..\n.\n\nB\u03bc\u03bd M N\nc(0)\u03bc\u03bd M N P\nc(1)\u03bc\u03bd M N P Q\n..\n.\n\nTable 1\nHierarchies at the level of classical fields, ghosts and ghost for ghosts.\n\n\u2022 The action S0 = S0 [\u03c6i ] (from (3.13)) is extended to a generalized action S[\u03c7n , \u03c7\u2217n ] also\ncontaining terms proportional to ghosts and antifields and subject to some boundary\nconditions8 .\n\u2022 The classical master equation is imposed\n(S, S) \u2261 2\n\n\u03b4r S \u03b4l S\n= 0,\n\u03b4\u03c7n \u03b4\u03c7\u2217n\n\n(5.1)\n\nwhere \u03b4r and \u03b4l mean right and left derivative respectively. Solutions of this master\nequation (subject to the boundary conditions mentioned above) are an expansion in\n7\n\nTo prove the vanishing of the transformation, the generalized Jacobi identity, mentioned in footnote 4,\nneeds to be used.\n8\nThese are: the classical limit S[\u03c7n , \u03c7\u2217n = 0] = S0 [\u03c6i ] and a properness condition (see [13, 11]).\n\n7\n\n\fthe antifields with the gauge structure tensors (gauge generators, structure constants,\nzeromodes, . . .) as coefficients. In this sense the master equation generates the gauge\nstructure of the theory. Hence, as said above, it provides a very compact way to write\ndown the gauge structure of a theory.\nIn [1] a generic form for the generalized action S is proposed\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 a0\nc0\na1\n\u2217\na0\n\u2217 i\na0\nb0\nS = S0 +\u03c6i R a0 c(0) + c(0) a0 Z(1) a1 c(1) + T b0 c0 c(0) c(0)\n2\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 ji\n1 ij\na0\nb0\n\u2217 \u2217\na1\n+ ...,\n+\u03c6i \u03c6j\nV a c(1) + E a0 b0 c(0) c(0)\n2 (1) 1\n4\n\n(5.2)\n\nwith S0 the action in (3.13) and Ri a0 , T a0 b0 c0 , Z(1) a0 , . . . some unspecified tensors. After\nimposing the master equation (5.1) it is shown that these tensors correspond respectively\nto the gauge generators, structure 'constants', zeromodes, . . . that were discussed in the\nprevious section.\n\n6\n\nConclusions\n\nConventional gaugings break the underlying duality covariance of the theory. This is a problem when systematically classifying gauged supergravities. The embedding tensor formalism\nprovides a method to circumvent this problem and to describe generalized gaugings while\npreserving duality covariance. However, it demands extra ingredients such as a tensor hierarchy and extra gauge transformations, which complicate the gauge structure of the theory.\nOne argues that the gauge structure encountered in the embedding tensor formalism is soft,\nopen and reducible. Hence, it is appropriate to reformulate it in terms of the field-antifield\nformalism. Once rewritten it becomes clear that the original classical hierarchy of the gauge\nfields also appears at the level of the ghosts, ghosts for ghosts, etc. Finally, it is found that\nthe master equation is able to produce the complete gauge structure of the theory.\nWe thank the organizers of the XVIth European workshop in String Theory in Madrid\nfor the offered opportunity to present this work, which is supported in part by the FWO Vlaanderen, Project No. G.0235.05, and in part by the Federal Office for Scientific, Technical\nand Cultural Affairs through the IAP Programme P6/11-P.\n\n8\n\n\fReferences\n[1] F.
