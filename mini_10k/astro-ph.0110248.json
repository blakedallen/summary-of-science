INTRODUCTION\nWhen was the first turbulence in the universe? When was the first turbulent mixing?\nWhen was the first gravitational structure formation? For the first time it may be possible\nto answer such questions. New information about the early universe is flooding in from a\nvariety of very high resolution telescopes on the earth surface and in space, covering\nfrequency bands previously unavailable. A new generation of computers and software are\nstruggling to keep pace, along with a new generation of theoreticians and theories.\nCosmological and astrophysical models for gravitational structure formation that remained\nundisturbed for decades during the last century are now confronted daily with new data that\nmust be accommodated or the models abandoned.\n\n1\n\n\f10/12/01 8:21 AM 2\n\nThe standard model of gravitational structure formation is presented in books about\ncosmology such as Weinberg 1972, Silk 1989, Kolb and Turner 1990, Peebles 1993,\nPadmanabhan 1993 and Rees 2000. Unfortunately, the model is based on the gravitational\ninstability criterion of Jeans 1902, where density \u03c1 fluctuations on scales larger than the\nJeans length scale LJ = VS/(\u03c1G)1/2 are unstable to gravitational condensation and those\nsmaller are not, where V S is the speed of sound and G is Newton's constant of gravity. The\nJeans theory and Jeans gravitational condensation criterion are disputed by Gibson 1996,\n2000 and elsewhere. Alternative length scale criteria for gravitational instability are\nproposed depending on viscous, turbulent and diffusive constraints. These significantly\nalter the predicted times and mass scales of gravitational structure formation. The standard\nJeans-CDM model is discussed in Section 2, the Gibson 1996-2002 model in Section 3,\ncomparisons to observations in Section 4, and conclusions in Section 5.\n2. STANDARD COSMOLOGICAL MODEL FOR STRUCTURE FORMATION\nJeans 1902 applied linear perturbation theory to the inviscid Euler equations with gravity,\nreducing the fluid mechanical problem to one of gravitational acoustics. Sound waves\ntravel a wave length \u03bb in a time period \u03c4S = \u03bb/VS. The gravitational free fall time \u03c4FF is\n(\u03c1G)-1/2. The two time scales \u03c4S and \u03c4FF are equal for \u03bb = LJ. Short wavelength sound\nwaves propagate away before they are affected by gravity. Long wavelength sound waves\nare gravitationally unstable. Jeans' criterion for gravitational structure formation is that\ndensity fluctuations on scales L > LJ are unstable and L < LJ are stable as long as L is less\nthan the horizon scale LH.\nJeans' theory ignores effects of viscous and turbulent forces on gravitational structure\nformation, as well as diffusivity. Most density maxima and minima do not propagate with\nthe sound speed, but diffuse to a symmetric configuration and then move with the fluid. On\nscales smaller than LJ, such non-acoustic density maxima and minima are absolutely\nunstable to gravitational forces in the absence of viscous and turbulence forces or strong\ndiffusivity D. The diffusion velocity D/L matches the gravitational velocity L(\u03c1G)1/2 at the\nSchwarz diffusive length scale LSD = [D2/\u03c1G]1/4. Self gravitational forces match viscous\nforces at the viscous Schwarz scale LSV = [\u03b3\u03bd/\u03c1G]1/2, and gravity matches turbulence forces\nat the Schwarz turbulent scale LST = \u03b51/2/[\u03c1G]3/4, where \u03c1 is the gas density, G is 6.72 10-11\nm3 kg-1 s-2, \u03b3 is the rate-of-strain, and \u03b5 is the viscous dissipation rate. Pressure forces are in\nacoustical equilibrium on scales smaller than LJ, and cannot prevent either gravitational\ncollapse on density maxim, or prevent expansion as gravitational rarefaction waves to form\nvoids at density minima. Pressure support and thermal support are misconceptions deriving\nfrom the invalid Jeans 1902 instability criterion. The maximum speed of rarefaction waves\nis the sound speed VS, from well known gas dynamics, and this limits the time scale of void\nformation rather than the free fall time \u03c4FF. The Gibson 1996, 2000 criterion for\ngravitational structure formation is that density fluctuations are unstable on scales L > [LSD,\nLST, LSV]Max, as long as L < LH. As soon as the largest Schwarz scale is less than the\nhorizon scale LH, structure will form, even if LJ > LH.\nBecause the sound speed VS in the plasma epoch before 1013 s (300,000 years) is c/31/3, the\nJeans scale L J is always larger than the horizon scale of causal connection LH = ct, where c\nis the speed of light and t is the time since the big bang. Therefore no gravitational\nstructure can form in the primordial baryonic plasma of electrons, protons and alpha\n\n2\n\n\f10/12/01 8:21 AM 3\n\nparticles (4He). Even after the hot gas forms, the Jeans mass MJ = \u03c1LJ3 is about 10 36 kg, or\na million solar masses. Without fragmentation at smaller scales or some nonbaryonic\nmagic, such massive gas blobs would rapidly collapse to form short-lived superstars,\nsupernovas and massive black holes in brief periods (a few million years); that is, no\nplanets, no stars, no galaxies, no galaxy-clusters, and no galaxy-super-clusters could ever\nappear. The Jeans model fails immediately for a Universe consisting entirely of baryons.\nTo salvage the observed Universe within Jeans' theory it is necessary to hypothesize the\nexistence of \"cold dark matter\" (CDM). The sound speed VS is [kT/m]1/2 for an ideal gas\nconsisting of particles of mass m at temperature T, where k = 1.38 10-23 kg m2 s-2 K-1 is\nBoltzmann's constant. It has been known for many years that the universe is nearly flat and\nthat a huge amount of invisible (dark) matter must exist in galaxies and galaxy clusters to\nprevent them from flying apart due to centrifugal forces. Most of the invisible matter must\nbe nonbaryonic because the baryonic matter density is limited to < 3% by precise\nconstraints of neucleosynthesis, Weinberg 1972. A flat universe today has critical density\n\u03c1Crit = 10-26 kg m-3 so its expansion coasts gradually toward zero with time rather than\naccelerating for a \u03c1< \u03c1Crit open universe, or reversing toward a big crunch for a \u03c1> \u03c1Crit\nclosed universe. The observed \u03c1 is indistinguishable from and remarkably close to the flatuniverse critical value (some claim differently), which means that about 99.9% of the\nmatter is dark, about 97% of the dark matter is nonbaryonic, and about 97% of the baryonic\nmatter is also dark. The standard model assumes the nonbaryonic matter is also \"cold\" with\nLJ < L H during the plasma epoch so it can condense to provide gravitational potential wells\nto capture the baryonic matter and cause it to form the stars and galaxies observed. Why is\nthis imaginary \"cold-dark-matter\" cold? The answer is that it must be cold or Jeans' theory\nwon't work. But how can it be cold if it is collisionless and was formed hot? An expanding\nideal gas cools because it does pressure work on the expanding surroundings at the expense\nof its internal energy, but a collisionless gas can't exert pressure and can't do any such work,\nso its particles must maintain their velocities and temperatures forever. Figure 1 gives an\noutline of the standard CDM cosmological model and the large number of questionable\nareas for the evolution of gravitational structure by this scenario.\n\nBig\nBang\n\nt = 10-43 s\n\n? ? ? ? ?\n\nPlasma and\nJeans\nmass CDM\nfragments\n\nJeans mass gas\nfragments,\nCDM potential\nwells\n\n1013 s\n\nPopulation III\nsuperstars\nreionize gas\n\n4\u00d71015 s\n\nGalaxies collapse\nGalaxy\ninto CDM\nclusters and\npotential wells superclusters\n\n3\u00d71016 s (1 Gy)\n\n4\u00d71017 s (now)\n\nFigure 1. The standard model for structure formation is highly questionable.\nAs shown in Fig. 1, somehow the nonbaryonic matter must form massive CDM seeds\nduring the plasma epoch to nucleate the larger scale structures observed. The seeds cluster\nand begin to collect gas by gravity, circumventing the Jeans criterion for the hot gas and\ntriggering the formation of a (tailored) number of superstars with masses comparable to the\nseed masses; that is, 103 to 106 solar masses (MSUN = 2 1030 kg). If the cold dark matter\n(CDM) is so weakly collisional that it can't be observed, then yet another misconception is\nneeded to prevent the CDM potential wells from diffusing away. This is provided by\nBinney and Tremaine 1987, p190, where it shown that gravitationally bound systems of\nweakly collisional particles have relaxation times R/v N/lnN, where R/v is the crossing time\n\n3\n\n\f10/12/01 8:21 AM 4\n\nfor the CDM protogalaxies, R is the size, v is the particle velocity and N is the number of\nparticles. To produce a flat universe with kinetic energy precisely matching gravitational\npotential energy using neutrinos (the only known form of non-baryonic dark matter) the\nneutrino mass m must be about 10-35 kg. Thus N/lnN is about 1075 for a neutrino CDM\npotential well of dwarf galaxy mass 1039 kg, giving \u2248 \u221e relaxation times for reasonable\nvalues of R/v. The situation is no different for more massive neutralinos, another CDM\ncandidate (there are dozens), where the relaxation time is about 1077 s. The problem with\nthis model is that it neglects the phenomena of core collapse, Binney and Tremaine 1987,\np528. For any initial condition of the CDM blob, all of its particles pass near the core in a\nfree fall period \u03c4FF and the core becomes progressively more concentrated with time\nconstant \u03c4FF. No matter how small the collision cross section of the CDM particles, they\nare forced to interact at the core and randomise their velocities in times of order \u03c4FF. The\neffective diffusivity of the blob R2/\u03c4FF monotonically increases toward the particle\ndiffusivity D = LCv and R approaches LSD, Gibson 2002. CDM seed fragments cannot form\nin the first place, but if they were to they would rapidly diffuse away and not cluster.\nFurther difficulties beset the standard model. Quasars are very bright sources of light at\ngreat distances, with maximum observed red shifts greater than 6. Very little quasar light is\nabsorbed compared to that expected from the hydrogen budget (the Gunn-Peterson\nparadox), so it is assumed in the standard model that the hydrogen has been re-ionized. The\nre-ionization of the universe requires superstars and supernovas, with feedback, capable of\nreversing the plasma to gas transition, Ciardi et al. 2000. Unfortunately for CDM, the\nextremely violent events and huge amount of energy required to re-ionize all the free\nhydrogen and helium gas would have had detectable side effects, such as the formation of\nstrong turbulence, contrary to the laminar universe indicated by the small \u03b4T/T \u2248 10-5\ncosmic microwave background T fluctuations, and a large production by Population III\nsupernovae of heavy elements not seen in the metal-free Population II stars of globular star\nclusters in the outskirts of galaxies. Tailored CDM clumping is needed to limit the number\nof such superstars. The dense concentrations of small, ancient stars in globular clusters\nobserved could not possibly have formed under conditions of strong Population III\nsupernova turbulence because the large LST scales of the turbulence would have prevented\nit, just as it does in spiral galaxy disks that contain mostly widely spaced metal-rich\npopulation I stars like the sun, and open star clusters like the Pleiades. In the Gibson 1996\nmodel, Population III stars never existed and the universe never reionized.\nA major difficulty for the standard CDM model is the timing of large structure formation,\nwhich occurs very late. The imaginary CDM protogalaxies take a billion years or so to\ncollect enough baryons to form collapsing galaxies of stars, the galaxies take a lot of time\nto form clusters, and the clusters take a lot of time to form superclusters. Unfortunately,\nvery high resolution telescopes on the ground and in space can now see mature galaxies in\nclusters and superclusters at times when none of these structures should exist by the\nstandard CDM model, Steidel et al. 2000. N body CDM numerical simulations show lots\nof galaxies should still be present in the 1024 m supervoids between the 1047 kg\nsuperclusters, but these spaces are found to be quite empty, Peebles 2001. Observations of\nsupervoid densities show values about 10-35 kg m -3, corresponding to no more than a dozen\nglobular clusters and no galaxies at all in a supervoid. Peebles suggests voids pose a crisis\nfor CDM models. The crisis may require abandoning Jeans-CDM entirely. Without JeansCDM, extremely empty supervoids are expected since these are the first gravitational\n\n4\n\n\f10/12/01 8:21 AM 5\n\nstructures to form starting in the first 10% of the plasma epoch at 1012 s.

Reheating of the Universe by Population III superstars in the standard Cold\nDark Matter model (Ostriker and Gnedin 1996, fig. 1 L64). In (a) on the left, a few\nsuperstars form at redshift z = 17 (175 million years after the big bang) and re-ionize\nall remaining gas. A stable interval occurs as the CDM seeds clump to dwarf galaxy\nand galaxy masses between z = 7 and 4 at a billion years when galaxies begin forming.\nThe CDM clump mass (MNL) is not much different than the Jeans mass MJ in (b).\nThe Ostriker and Gnedin 1996 CDM model shown in Fig. 2 relies on the Press and\nSchechter 1974 formalism for the self-similar gravitational condensation of self-gravitating\nmasses in an expanding universe. Press-Schechter found by N-body simulations that seed\nparticles become nonlinear and clump to form larger structures in a bottom-up cascade from\nsmall to larger masses. They found 6 1037 kg seeds at 1013 s produce a match to\nsuperclusters presently observed, larger than the CDM seeds used by Ostriker and Gnedin\n1996. All such CDM studies fail to explain how CDM particles can form these sticky\nseeds, or how \"nonlinear\" clumps of the CDM seeds can prevent CDM particles from\ndiffusing away. Use of Jeans-CDM makes almost every part of Fig. 2 questionable.\n3. FLUID MECHANICAL MODEL FOR COSMOLOGICAL STRUCTURES\nThe Gibson 1996 fluid mechanical model for gravitational structure formation is virtually\nopposite to the Jeans-CDM model. The largest gravitational structures form first rather\nthan last. The first star appears before the gas is dark, so the \"dark ages\" of Fig. 2 never\nhappened. The nonbaryonic dark matter is driven to form structures by the baryonic\nstructures, reversing their roles in CDM. Turbulence begins immediately and drives the big\nbang rather than being suppressed or irrelevant, Gibson 2002. Turbulence in the expanding\n\n5\n\n\f10/12/01 8:21 AM 6\n\nplasma and gas is not inhibited by the Hubble flow but may be caused by Hubble relative\nvelocities \u03b3L, where \u03b3 is the \"Hubble constant\" 1/t and L is a separation distance. Viscosity\nor buoyancy forces prevent turbulence depending on the Reynolds number \u03b32L/\u03bd and\nFroude number \u03b3/(G\u03b4\u03c1)1/2 criteria in the usual way. Observations that \u03b4T/T in the Cosmic\nMicrowave Background (CMB) is only 10-5 prove that the primordial plasma flow was nonturbulent because fully developed turbulence driven by the Hubble flow would produce\n\u03b4T/T values orders of magnitude larger; so that either viscosity or buoyancy or both must\nbe damping turbulence in the primordial plasma. Because the viscosity of the primordial\nplasma near its transition to gas is inadequate to prevent turbulence at 1013 s, buoyancy\nforces must be responsible, Gibson 2000. The only way buoyancy forces can arise is if\ngravitational structure already exists in the primordial plasma, contrary to Jeans' theory.\nFigure 3 summarizes the major stages of cosmological structure formation in the Gibson\n1996, 1997, 2000, 2002 model. Note that Fig. 2 begins at 4 1015 s, well after Fig. 3. ends.\nFossil turbulent\ntemperature\nfluctuations\nBig bang\nformed by\nturbulence driven inflation beyond\nthe horizon scale,\nby Planck-Kerr\nbaryons and\nPlanck particle\n\"Weakly\ninertial vortex\nInteracting\nforces begins\nMassive\nUniverse\nParticles\"\n(WIMPs) form\nt = 10-43\nto 10-35 s\n\n10 -33 to\n10 2 s\n\nFirst gravitational\nstructures at\nprotosupercluster mass\nwhen horizon scale\nmatches turbulent\nSchwarz scale,\nproducing fossil density\nand vorticity turbulence.\nWIMPs fill voids and\nslow fragmentation.\n\nPSCs, 1047 kg\n\nPlasma\nfragmentation\ncontinues to\nprotogalaxy\nscales.

Cosmological structure formation, Gibson 1996-2002.\nAs shown in Fig. 3, no gravitational structure forms for 30,000 years after the big bang as\nthe universe expands and cools with LSV > LST > LH. Big bang turbulent temperature\nfluctuations are fossilized by inflation to scales larger than the horizon at 10-33 s, Gibson\n2002. The inflated strong-force freeze-out scale 10-2 m enters the horizon at t = 10-10 s, well\nbefore nucleosynthesis at 102 s (the first three minutes), Weinberg 1977. Fossil turbulent\ntemperature fluctuations are stretched by the Hubble (uniform straining) flow until the time\nof nucleosynthesis. Radiation super-viscosities reduce the Reynolds number to subcritical\nvalues < 102, preventing any turbulence until late in the plasma epoch after matter\ndominates radiation at 1010 s. Nucleosynthesis rate constants are extremely sensitive to\ntemperature (~ T 5, Peacock 2000) so fossil temperature turbulence fluctuations persisting at\nnucleosynthesis can produce hydrogen-helium plasma density fluctuations (i.e., fossil\ndensity turbulence) to trigger the first gravitational formation of structure at about 1012 s.\nGibson 1997 shows the horizon mass \u03c1(t)[ct]3 matches the supercluster mass at time 1012 s,\nFigure 4, where \u03c1(t) is the critical density for a flat universe and t is the time since the big\nbang, calculated using Einstein's equations in Weinberg (1972, p540). The supercluster\nmass 10 47 kg is 10-6 times the present horizon mass 1053 kg because the supercluster scale\nis observed to be 10-2 times the horizon scale.

Hydropaleontology using the observed supercluster mass: the horizonmass/supercluster-mass ratio increases with time t and the critical density decreases\n(from Einstein's equations), Weinberg (1972, p540), suggesting the time of the first\ngravitational structure formation was 1012 seconds (30,000 years), Gibson 1997.\nThe cosmological scale factor a(t) in Fig. 4 is the ratio R(t)/Ro, where R(t) is the size a\nlength Ro at present was at time t before space was stretched according to the general\nrelativity equations of Einstein. For example, at time 2 1012 s, a(t) was 2.7 10-4, Weinberg\n1972, p540, so the critical density then was 10-26/a3 = 5 10-16 kg m-3. Most of the matter\nwas nonbaryonic, by a factor of about 30 to 1, so the baryonic matter density at the time of\nfirst fragmentation was about \u03c1o = 2 10 -17 kg m-3, as shown in Fig. 3. This initial density of\nfragmentation should be preserved, along with the rate-of-strain \u03b3o = 10 -12 s -1, as a fossil of\nthis event, as shown by arrows in Fig. 3. This fossil value \u03c1o is the density of all PSCs,\nPGs, PGSs, and PFPs formed in Fig. 3. \u03c1o is preserved in many fossils of this first\nfragmentation such as the size of galaxy cores, about 1020 m, and the core densities of\nglobular star clusters. Figure 5 shows a recent Hubble Space Telescope image of the core\nof the Milky Way globular star cluster Omega Centauri (NGC 5139), for comparison.\n\n\u03c1 = 2\u00d710 -17 kg m-3\nGlobular cluster\n\n50,000 stars\n\nOmega Centauri\n\nHST-STScI-PRC01-33\n1.3x10 17 m\n\nFigure 5.

The total number of stars in the globular cluster is over\n2 106 making \u03c9 Cen the largest globular cluster in the Galaxy in terms of numbers of stars.\nMost of the other 200 Milky Way globular clusters have similar core densities and star\nnumbers with ages of 13.5\u00b10.5 Gy, Ashman and Zepf 1998. Such large globular cluster\nages coincide with recent best estimates for the age of the universe, and seem to rule out the\nbillion years (1 Gy) of CDM clustering and galaxy formation shown in Fig. 2.\nBright globular star clusters in all galaxies all have nearly the same mass, size, age and\ndensity, which is not easily (or possibly) explained by the CDM scenario of Fig. 2. The\ninitial violent formation of Population III superstars in Fig. 2 not only reionizes the gas but\nmakes the Jeans mass too large to permit the uniform mass near 106 MSUN of bright globular\nstar clusters observed. In the Gibson 1996 scenario of Fig. 3, formation of primordial fog\nparticles prevents the formation of Population III superstars (or any stars) in the initial\nstages of PGC fragmentation (except at the cores of proto-galaxies). Most stars are formed\nby an accretional cascade of PFPs, and most PFPs have never formed stars but persist as the\nbaryonic dark matter. [The Pop. III exception is that the increased probability of collisions\nat proto-galaxy centers of mass might cause a maelstrom of turbulent gas with large enough\nturbulent Schwarz scales LST and sufficient cooling to prevent star formation until the rising\ndensity permits collapse to a superstar, a supernova, a black hole and a \u03b3-ray burst]. Many\ncentral black holes have been identified in galaxies, but none (so far) at the center of\nglobular star clusters. Several dim globular clusters such as Polomar 13 have been detected\nin the Milky Way far out in the halo, at 1021 m or more, with only 103 to 104 stars\nconcentrated in small cores. Most of the mass of such globulars may be dark and frozen as\nPFPs that are bound by gravity and friction. The high resolution of the HST has revealed\nnumerous young globular star clusters in starburst or merging galaxies such as NGC 6946,\n1705, NGC 1569, the Antennae, NGC 7252 and NGC 3256, with ages of only 106 years or\nless, Larsen et al. 2001. It seems likely that these young globulars were formed from dark\nPGCs and their unaccreted PFPs. Population III stars rarely form in the scenario of Fig. 3.\nNo re-ionization of the universe is needed to explain the Gunn-Peterson missing neutral gas\nbecause the hydrogen-helium is not uniformly distributed as in Fig. 2, but is condensed out\nof the line of sight of quasars in the form of frozen planets starting about redshift 30 when\nthe temperature of the background radiation falls below the freezing point of hydrogen.\nThe mass of primordial-fog-particles is determined by the viscous Schwarz scale LSV =\n(\u03b3\u03bd/\u03c1G)1/2 existing in the proto-galaxy gas blobs emerging from the plasma epoch. The\ndensity should be the fossil density turbulence value \u03c1o = 2 10-17 kg m-3 from the first\nfragmentation time 1012 s, as shown in Fig. 3, and the rate of strain \u03b3 should be the fossil\nvorticity turbulence value \u03b3o = 10-12 s-1 (\u03b5\u03bf \u2248 200 m2 s -3). Fossil turbulence formation and\nproperties are reviewed by Gibson 1999. The weighted average hydrogen-helium gas\nviscosity at 3000 K is 2.4 10 -4 kg m-1 s-1, so \u03bd is 1.3 10 13 m2 s-1, giving L SV = 9.8 1013 m and\nMPFP = \u03c1LSV3 = 1.9 1025 kg, three times the mass of the Earth, which is an upper bound\nsince both the density and rate-of-strain may have been reduced between 1012 and 10 13 s by\nexpansion or viscous friction in the proto-galaxies. If the assumed density is 10 -17 and the\nassumed \u03b3 is 10-13, then MPFP is reduced to 2.1 1024 kg, a third of the mass of the Earth.\n\n8\n\n\f10/12/01 8:21 AM 9\n\nbaryons\n\nproto-galaxysuperclusters\n\nnon-baryons\n\nGas\nPlasma\nproto-galaxies proto-galaxies\n\n1020\n\nPlasma\n\nm\n\n\"Dark\" Galaxy\nPGCs PFP\n\n\u03c1baryons = 2\u00d710-17\nkg m-3\n\nt=\n\n1011\n\nCMB\nz = 1100\n\nz = 5400\n\ns\n\nfirst\nstar\nis\nborn\n\nt = 1012 s\n\nt = 1013 s\n\nz = 560\n\nt = 1013 s\n\nt = 3\u00d71013 s\n\nFigure 6. The first structure formation from PSCs to \"Dark\" Galaxies\nFigure 6 shows the first gravitational structure formation of Fig. 3. The progression of\nstructure formation is from left to right in time starting with a mix of baryonic and nonbaryonic particles of the hot plasma before formation of PSC foam with non-baryonic\nparticles diffusing to fill the voids. \"Dark\" galaxies result with 100% dark (i. e., invisible)\nmatter, with the primordial hydrogen-helium gas fragmented at the Jeans scale to form 1036\nkg PGC clumps of 10 25 kg PFPs and the first stars in the free fall time \u03c4FF = 3 10 13 s for \u03c1 =\n2 10 -17 kg m-3.

Ultraviolet radiation and plasma jets emitted by the dying star illuminate the\nsurrounding interstellar medium at distances about 1016 m from the star, creating a glowing\nregion that looked like a planet through small telescopes. Helix is the closest planetary\nnebula to the earth at 5 1018 m, so cometary globules only dimly visible from surface\ntelescopes gave spectacular images in the HST photographs of C. R. O'Dell shown in Fig.\n7. The mass of some of the larger objects is reported to be about 1025 kg, supporting the\nFig. 7 interpretation that these are 1013 m photo-ionized cocoons with PFPs inside that have\nbeen partially evaporated by radiation and wind from the central dying star. Little evidence\nsupports the claim by some authors that the gas and cometary knots of planetary nebulae\nare ejected from the central star, rather than emerging out of the dark by evaporation of\nPFPs that dominate the mass of the interstellar medium as the baryonic dark matter.\nFurther evidence that planetary mass objects dominate the mass of galaxies is provided by\nthe dominant twinkling frequency of background quasar images lensed by a foreground\ngalaxy, such as the twinkle in Figure 8 reproduced from Schild 1996.\n16.38\n\n16.40\n\nMicrolensing\nVariability of the\nGravitationally\nLensed Quasar\nQ0957+561 A\n\n90 Day, 10\n\n25\n\nkg\n\n16.42\n\n16.44\n\n16.46\n1988.0\n\n\"Rogue Planets ... likely\nto be the missing mass\",\nR.

CONCLUSIONS\nJeans-Cold-Dark-Matter scenarios for gravitational structure formation in cosmology and\nastrophysics are highly questionable. The Jeans 1902 theory and length scale criterion for\ngravitational instability neglects viscous, turbulence and diffusional effects that are all\nimportant to the formation of the first gravitational structures. A variety of fluid\nmechanical misconceptions associated with the CDM concept are identified. Because\n\n10\n\n\f10/12/01 8:21 AM 11\n\nCDM particles are collisionless they cannot cool, condense, or clump as assumed, and\ncannot guide gravitational structure formation by providing the gravitational potential wells\nneeded to salvage the Jeans 1902 criterion by CDM. Schwarz-length-scale criteria predict\ngravitational structure formation in better agreement with observations of early galaxy\nexistence and clustering and resolve both the dark matter paradox and the Gunn-Peterson\nmissing-gas paradox. Population III superstars never form in great numbers and the\nuniverse never re-ionizes in the Gibson 1996-2002 scenario. Evidence that the baryonic\ndark matter consists of proto-globular-cluster PGC clumps of frozen hydrogen-helium\nprimordial-fog-particle PFP objects is provided by observations of young-globular-clusters\n(YGCs) formed in starburst and merger galaxies. YGC densities and masses match the oldglobular values, suggesting that YGCs are formed from ancient dark PGCs. A large\nnumber of PFPs are expected in the interstellar medium of the Galaxy disk from PGCs\ndisrupted by tidal forces as they pass through. Such unattached PFPs may be detected near\nhot objects by their large luminous photo-ionized evaporation shells, as shown in the Helix\nplanetary nebula of Fig. 7. Globular star clusters are observed in galaxies at radial\ndistances 3 1021 m, suggesting the Dark-PGC-PFP (DPP) baryonic dark matter halo\nprobably extends to greater distances. This may explain why the MACHO and EROS\ncollaborations failed to detect any earth-mass objects microlensing stars of the Large\nMagellanic Cloud 1.6 10 21 m from the earth. Most of the Milky Way DPP dark matter may\nbe far beyond the LMC stars, along with the nonbaryonic dark matter halo at 1022 m.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe author would like to thank Professor Fazle Hussain for discussions and comments\nleading to this paper.\nREFERENCES\nAshman, K.
