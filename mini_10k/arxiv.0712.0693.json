With the development of human society\n4 and industrial technology, theories and methods of cryptography have been\n5 changed and improved gradually, and meanwhile cryptanalysis has also been\n6 developed. In 1949, Shannon published his seminar paper \"Communication\n7 theory of secrecy systems\" [1], which marked the beginning of the modern\n8 cryptology.\n2\n\nIn the past two decades, the security of multimedia data has become more\n10 and more important. However, it has been recognized that the traditional\n11 text-encryption schemes cannot efficiently protect multimedia data due to\n12 some special properties of the multimedia data, such as strong redundancy\n9\n\n\u2217 Corresponding author: Chengqing Li (swiftsheep@hotmail.com).\n\nPreprint submitted to J. of Zhejiang University SCIENCE\n\n24 October 2018\n\n\fand bulk size of the uncompressed data. To meet this challenge, a number\n14 of special image encryption schemes based on some nonlinear theories were\n15 proposed [2\u20134]. Yet, many of them are found to be insecure from the view\n16 point of cryptography [5\u201317].\n\n13\n\nIn [18], Ismail et al. tried to encrypt images efficiently by modifying the classical Hill cipher [19]. This paper studies the security of the scheme proposed\n19 in [18] and reports the following findings: 1) there exist a number of invalid\n20 secret keys; 2) the scheme is insensitive to the change of the secret key; 3)\n21 the scheme is insensitive to the change of the plain-image; 4) the scheme can\n22 be broken with only one known/chosen plain-image; 5) the scheme has some\n23 other minor performance defects.\n17\n\n18\n\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. The next section briefly in25 troduces the encryption scheme to be studied. Section 3 presents detailed\n26 cryptanalysis of the scheme. The last section concludes the paper.\n24\n\n27\n\n2\n\nThe image encryption scheme to be studied\n\nThe scheme proposed in [18] scans the gray scales of a plain-image P (or\none channel of a color image) of size M \u00d7 N in a raster order and divides it\n\u2308M N/m\u2309\ninto \u2308MN/m\u2309 vectors of size m: {Pl }l=1\n, where Pl = {P ((l \u2212 1) * m +\n1), * * * , P ((l \u2212 1) * m + m)} (the last vector is padded with some zero bytes if\n\u2308M N/m\u2309\nMN can not be divided by m). Then, the vectors {Pl }l=1\nare encrypted\nin increasing order with the following function:\nCl = (Pl * Kl ) mod 256,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere K1 = (K1 [i, j])m\u00d7m , K1 [i, j] \u2208 Z256 , the initial state of Kl\u22652 is set to\nbe Kl\u22121 , and then every row of Kl is generated iteratively with the following\nfunction, for i = 1 \u223c m:\nKl [i, :] = (IV * Kl ) mod 256,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere IV is a vector of size 1 \u00d7 m and IV [i] \u2208 Z256 . Finally, the cipher-image\n\u2308M N/m\u2309\n29 is obtained as C = {Cl }\n.\nl=1\n28\n\n30\n\nThe secret key of the encryption scheme includes three parts: m, K0 , and IV .\nThe decryption procedure is the same as the above encryption procedure except that Eq. (1) is replaced by the following function:\nPl = (Cl * Kl\u22121 ) mod 256,\n2\n\n(3)\n\n\f31\n\nwhere (Kl * Kl\u22121 ) mod 256 = I, the identity matrix.\n\n32\n\n3\n\n33\n\n3.1 Some Defects of the Scheme\n\n34\n\n3.1.1 Invalid keys\n\n35\n\nAn invalid key is a key that fails to ensure the success of the encryption scheme.\n\nCryptanalysis\n\nFrom the following Fact 1 and Corollary 1, one can see that one secret key\n37 in the above-described scheme is invalid if and only if gcd(K1 , 256) 6= 1 or\n38 IV [i] mod 2 = 0.\n36\n\n39\n\n40\n\nFact 1 A matrix K is invertible in Zn if and only if gcd(det(K), n) = 1.\nProposition 1 det(Kl ) =\n\n\u0012\n\nm\nQ\n\ni=1\n\n\u0013\n\nIV [i] det(Kl\u22121 ).\n\nProof : According to Eq.

Without\n51 loss of generality, assume that the n-th significant bit of K1 (1, j0 ) is changed\nf\n52 from zero to one, where 0 \u2264 n \u2264 7. Let Kl denote the modified version of Kl .\nf\n53 The change Dl = Kl \u2212 Kl can be presented by the following two equations:\n\n50\n\nDl [:, j] \u2261 0, for j 6= j0 ,\n\uf8eb\n\nDl [:, j0 ] =\n\nm\nP\n\n\uf8ec\ni=1\n\uf8ec\nm\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec IV [1]D [1, j ] + P IV\nl\n0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\ni=2\n\uf8ec\n..\n\uf8ec\n.\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed m\u22121\nP\ni=1\n\n54\n\nIV [i]Dl\u22121 [i, j0 ]\n[i]Dl\u22121 [i, j0 ]\n\nIV [i]Dl [i, j0 ] + IV [m]Dl\u22121 [m, j0 ]\n\n(7)\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\nmod 256,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere D1 [1, j0 ] = 2n , D1 [i, j0 ] = 0, i = 2 \u223c m.\nSince IV [i] mod 2 6= 0, Dl [i, j0 ] 6= 0 always exist. From Eq. (8), one can see\nthat Dl [i, j0 ] \u2265 2n exists, which means that only the n0 -th bit of Cl [j0 ] may\npossibly be changed, where n0 \u2265 n. Note also that there is no influence on Cl\nif\n(Pl Dl [:, j0 ]) mod 256 = 0.\n\n4\n\n\fTo verify the above analysis, an experiment has been carried out using a plainimage \"Lenna\" with the secret key\n\uf8eb\n\nm = 4, IV = (3 9 17 33), K1 =\n\n\uf8ec 11\n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec 8\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec201\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n2\n5\n\n7 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n19 103\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\n203 119\n\n7\n\n9\n\n\uf8f6\n\n3\n\n\uf8f7.\n\uf8f7\n150\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n(9)\n\n21 35\n\nf [1, 2] = (K [1, 2]+\nOnly the 5-th significant bit of K1 [1, 2] is changed, namely K\n1\n1\n5\nf\nf\n56 2 ) mod 256. Let C denote the cipher-image corresponding to K1 .

The bit-planes of |C\n\nNow, consider the influence on Kl\u22652 if only one bit of IV is changed. Without\n60 loss of generality, assume the n-th significant bit of IV [1] is changed from\n61 zero to one. Similarly, let Dl denote the change of Kl . Due to the extremely\n62 complex formulation of Dl\u22653 , only D2 is shown here.\n59\n\n\uf8eb\n\nD2 [:, j] =\n\n63\n\nwhere j = 1 \u223c m.\n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\nK1 [1, j]2\nn\n\nD2 [1, j](IV [1] + 2 ) + K2 [1, j]2\nD2 [2, j] + IV [2]D2 [2, j]\n..\n.\nD2 [2, j] +\n\nm\u22121\nP\ni=2\n\n\uf8f6\n\nn\n\nIV [i]D2 [i, j]\n\nn\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\nmod 256,\n\n(10)\n\nTo see the influence of the change of IV , an experiment has been carried out\n65 using plain-image \"Lenna\", with the same secret key shown in Eq.

The bit-planes of difference between cipher-images corresponding\ng\n68 to IV and IV , respectively, are shown in Fig. 2.\n64\n\n5\n\n\fComparing Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, one can see that the sensitivty with respect\n70 to IV is much stronger than the one with respect to K1 , which agrees with\n71 the above theoretical analysis. But one bit change of a sub-key of a secure\n72 cipher should cause every bit of the ciphertext changed with a probability of\n1\n73 .

(1) is exactly the same as that of IV in Eq. (2),\n79 the analysis about its insensitivity to the change of the plain-image can be\n80 carried out just like the case about the sub-key IV discussed above.\n78\n\n81\n\n3.1.4 Some other problems\n\n82\n\nThe encryption scheme has the following additional problems:\n\n83\n\n(1) cannot encrypt plain-image of a fixed value zero;\n(2) efficiency of implementation is low : From [20, Thorem 2.3.3], one can see\nthat the number of invertible matrices of size m \u00d7 m in Z256 is\n2\n\n|GL(m, Z256 )| = 27m\n\nm\u22121\nY\n\n(2m \u2212 2k ).\n\n(11)\n\nk=0\n\nThus, the probability that a matrix of size m \u00d7 m in Z256 is invertible is\n2\n\npm =\n84\n85\n\n27m\n\nQm\u22121\n\nk=0 (2\n28m2\n\nm\n\n\u2212 2k )\n\n=\n\nm\nY\n\n1\n(1 \u2212 2\u2212k ) \u2248 .\n3\nk=1\n\n(12)\n\nSo, it needs O(3m2 ) and O(m2 *MN) times of computations, respectively,\n\u2308M N/m\u2309\nfor checking the reversibility of K1 and for calculating {Kl\u22121 }l=1\n.\n6\n\n\f86\n87\n88\n89\n90\n91\n92\n93\n94\n\nNote that these computations have no direct contributions to protecting\nthe plain-image.\n(3) the scope of sub-key m is limited : As discussed above, the larger the value\nm the higher the computational cost.\n(4) the confusion capability is weak : This problem is caused by the linearity of\nthe main encryption function. To demonstrate this defect, the encryption\nresult of one special plain-image is shown in Fig. 3, where Figure 3b) also\neffectively disproves the conclusion about the quality of encryption results\ngiven in [18, Sec. 4].\n\na) plain-image\n\nb) cipher-image\n\nFig. 3. A special test image, \"Test pattern\".\n\n95\n\n3.2 Known/Chosen-Plaintext Attack\n\nThe known/chosen-plaintext attack works by reconstructing the secret key or\n97 its equivalent based on some known/chosen plaintexts and their corresponding\n98 ciphertexts.\n96\n\n\u2308M N/m\u2309\n\nFor this encryption scheme, the equivalent key {Kl }l=1\ncan be recon(1)\n(m)\nstructed from m plain-images P\n\u223c P\nand their corresponding cipherimages C (1) \u223c C (m) by using\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8eb\n\n(1)\n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec Cl\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n(2)\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec (B) \uf8ec Cl\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\nKl = \uf8ecPl * \uf8ec .\n..\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n(m)\n\nCl\n\n7\n\n\uf8f6\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\uf8f8\n\nmod 256,\n\n(13)\n\n\fwhere\n\uf8eb\n\n(B)\n\nPl\n\n\uf8f6\u22121\n\n(1)\n\n\uf8ec Pl\n\uf8ec\n(2)\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec Pl\n\uf8ec\n=\uf8ec .\n..\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n(m)\n\nPl\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n.\n\n(14)\n\n(B)\n\nThe reversibility of Pl can be ensured by utilizing more than m plain-images\n100 or by choosing m special plain-images. Note that the above known/chosen101 plaintext attack can be carried out with only one know/chosen plain-image\n\u2308M N/m\u2309\n102 due to the very short period of sequence {Kl [:, j]}\nfor j = 1 \u223c m. To\nl=1\n103 study the period of this sequence, 10,000 tests have been done for a given\n104 value of IV of size 1 \u00d7 3, where K1 is selected randomly. The numbers of\n\u2308M N/m\u2309\n105 tests where the corresponding sequence {Kl (:, 1)}\nhas period p, Np ,\nl=1\n106 with some values of IV , is shown in Table 1, which shows that the period of\n\u2308M N/m\u2309\n107 {Kl [:, j]}\nis indeed very short.\nl=1\n99\n\nTable 1\nValues of Np with some values of IV , p = 2s , s = 3 \u223c 9.\n\n108\n\n4\n\nIV\n\nN8\n\nN16\n\nN32\n\nN64\n\nN128\n\nN256\n\nN512\n\n(91, 63, 45)\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1463\n\n8537\n\n(113, 25, 219)\n\n14\n\n34\n\n127\n\n561\n\n3561\n\n5703\n\n0\n\n(253, 115, 17)\n\n6\n\n20\n\n72\n\n284\n\n1081\n\n8537\n\n0\n\n(1, 3, 5)\n\n0\n\n0\n\n98\n\n284\n\n1081\n\n8537\n\n0\n\n(5, 121, 247)\n\n7\n\n36\n\n132\n\n561\n\n3561\n\n5703\n\n0\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this paper, the security and performance of an image encryption scheme\n110 based on the Hill cipher have been analyzed in detail. It has been found that\n111 the scheme can be broken with only one known/chosen plain-image. There\n112 is a simple necessary and sufficient condition that makes a number of secret\n113 keys invalid. In addition, the scheme is insensitive to the change of the se114 cret key/plain-image. Some other performance defects have also been found.\n115 In conclusion, the encryption scheme under study actually has much weaker\n116 security than the original Hill cipher, therefore is not recommended for appli117 cations.\n109\n\n8\n\n\f118\n\n5\n\nAcknowledgement\n\nThis research was supported by the City University of Hong Kong under the\n120 SRG project 7002134.\n\n119\n\n121\n\n122\n123\n\nReferences\n[1] C.
