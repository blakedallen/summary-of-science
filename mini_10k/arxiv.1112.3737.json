It is proved that the primordial curvature perturbation and tensor\nperturbation generated during these two conformally equivalent backgrounds are completely equal,\nand the scale invariance of perturbations is determined by the conformal invariance of field theory\nin slowly expanding background. In dual slowly expanding scenario, the primordial universe is\nasymptotical to a static state in infinite past. We discuss the implication of the results obtained.\nPACS numbers:\n\n1\n\n\fThe inflation scenario is the current paradigm of the early universe, which is highly\nfavored by observations. However, the inflatons are diversified in diversified inflation models\n[1]. What is inflaton is still a significant issue. Here, it will be disposed in an insightful\nperspective.\nThe perturbation on large scale consists of a constant mode and a mode dependent of\ntime [2]. When the scale factor is rapidly changed while \u01eb \u226a 1 is nearly constant, the\nconstant mode is responsible for the scale invariance of the primordial perturbations in\ninflation scenario[3].\nHowever, the scale invariance of curvature perturbation can also be obtained for |\u01eb| \u226b 1.\nThe evolution with \u01eb \u226b 1 is the slowly contracting, which is that of ekpyrotic universe [4].\nWhile \u01eb \u226a \u22121 gives the slow expansion [5], which has been applied for island universe [6].\nIn slowly evolving scenario, the tensor perturbation generated is generally strongly blue,\nwhich implies that it is negligible on large scale. While in inflationary scenario, the tensor\nperturbation is scale invariant, which can be detected.\nRecently, it has been found in [7] that, in a background of slowly expanding with the\nrapidly changed gravitational coupling, both the curvature perturbation and the tensor perturbation can be scale invariant, and the ratio of the tensor to scalar is in a regime consistent\nwith that of inflation scenario. This result is actually a reflection that the perturbation is\nconformal invariant fully nonperturbatively [8]. The conformal invariance of perturbations\nimplies that the background evolution having coincident predictions with that of inflation\nmight be designed by a conformal rescaling of inflationary background. Thus it might be\nsignificant to contemplate inflation in its conformally dual background, which might bring\na fruitful insight to the inflation scenario itself and also the early universe.\nHere, we will show that the inflationary background can be conformally dual to a slowly\nexpanding background, which is described by a conformal field theory conformally coupled\nto gravity. We prove that the primordial curvature perturbation and tensor perturbation\ngenerated in both pictures are be completely equal, and the scale invariance of perturbations\nis determined by the conformal invariance of field theory in slowly expanding background.\nWe discuss the implication of the results obtained.\nWe firstly will show the slowly expanding background, which is described by a conformal\nfield theory conformally coupled to gravity, is actually conformally dual to the inflationary\n\n2\n\n\fbackground. We begin with\nL\u223c\n\nMP2 ef f\n1\n1\nR + (\u2202\u03bc \u03c6)2 \u2212 \u03bb\u03c64\u2212\u2206 ,\n2\n2\n4\n\n(1)\n\nwhere MP2 = 1, MP2 ef f = \u03be\u03c62 , and \u03be \u2243 1/6 will be determined. In [9], the perturbation of the\nfield conformally coupled to the gravity has been studied, however, there the field is a light\nfield which hardly affect the cosmological evolution, and the potential of field is negative.\nHere, the potential is positive, and the field is ghostlike, which is required for implementing\nthe slow expansion. However, as will be showed, there is not the ghost instability.\nThe calculation is highly similar to that in [5]. The background evolution of the slow\nexpansion is [5],[10],\na\u223c\n\n1\n,\n(t\u2217 \u2212 t)1/|\u01eb|\n\nH=\n\n1\n\n(2)\n\n|\u01eb|(t\u2217 \u2212 t)\n\nfor \u01eb \u226a \u22121. When 3H 2\u03c62 \u226a 6H \u03c6\u0307\u03c6 is neglected, the Fridmann equation is simplified as\n\nThis requires \u2206 \u2261\n\n2\n,\n|\u01eb|\n\n\u2212 21 \u03c6\u03072 + 41 \u03bb\u03c64\u2212\u2206\n1\nH\u2243\n.\n\u223c\nd\n2\n|\u01eb|(t\u2217 \u2212 t)\n3 dt MP ef f\n\n(3)\n\np\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2/\u03bb\n1\n\u03c6 \u223c 1 + O( )\n,\n|\u01eb| (t\u2217 \u2212 t)1/|\u01eb|+1\n\n(4)\n\nand\n\nwhere the deviation \u223c 1/|\u01eb| is required to accurately give Eq.(3). Thus \u03c6 \u223c\n\n\u01eb \u226a \u22121. The result is consistent with 3H 2 \u03c62 \u226a 6H \u03c6\u0307\u03c6, since\nH\u03c6 \u223c\n\n1\n1\n\u226a\n\u03c6\u0307\n\u223c\n|\u01eb|(t\u2217 \u2212 t)2\n(t\u2217 \u2212 t)2\n\nfor \u01eb \u226a \u22121. The equation of \u1e22 is given by,\n\u0012\n\u0013\nd 2\nd2\n2\n2MP ef f \u1e22 \u2212\nMP ef f H = \u03c6\u03072 \u2212 2 MP2 ef f ,\ndt\ndt\n\n1\n(t\u2217 \u2212t)\n\nfor\n\n(5)\n\n(6)\n\nwhere MP2 ef f = \u03be\u03c62 . This requires\n1\n1\n).\n\u03be \u2243 (1 +\n6\n3|\u01eb|\n\n(7)\n\nThus for |\u01eb| \u226b 1, \u03be = 1/6 is just that of conformal coupling. This implies that the field\ntheory (1) is a conformal field theory, conformally coupled to the gravity, however, there is\na slight deviation of \u223c 1/|\u01eb|. We will see it is this deviation that determines the tilt of the\nspectrum of primordial perturbation.\n3\n\n\fWe conformally rescale g\u03bc\u03bd as\ngE\u03bc\u03bd = MP2 ef f g\u03bc\u03bd .\n\n(8)\n\nWe follow Ref.[11]. The line element is ds2E = MP2 ef f ds2 , which gives dtE = MP ef f dt. Thus\nwe have\ntE =\n\nZ\n\nMP ef f dt = \u221a\n\n|\u01eb|\n,\n3\u03bb(t\u2217 \u2212 t)1/|\u01eb|\n\n(9)\n\nwhere tE is positive and Eq.(7) is applied. aE = MP ef f a brings HE ,\n!\n1\n|\u01eb|\n\u1e40P ef f\nHE =\nH+\n\u2243 ,\nMP ef f\nMP ef f\ntE\nR\nwhere Eq.(9) is applied. Thus aE is given by aE \u223c exp HE dtE , which is\n|\u01eb|\n\naE \u223c tE .\n\n(10)\n\n(11)\n\nThis is just inflation since |\u01eb| \u226b 1. The field \u03c6E after this conformal rescaling is canonical\nd\u03c62E =\nThus \u03c6E =\n\nq\n\n2\nln \u03c6.\n|\u01eb|\n\n1\nMP2 ef f\n\n\u0001\n6MP2 ef f,\u03c6 \u2212 1 d\u03c62 \u2243\n\n2\nd\u03c62 .\n2\n|\u01eb|\u03c6\n\n(12)\n\nThus (1) after the conformal rescaling is given by\n1\n1\n\u2212\nLE \u223c RE \u2212 (\u2202E\u03bc \u03c6E )2 \u2212 9 \u03bb e\n2\n2\n\nq\n\n2\n\u03c6\n|\u01eb| E\n\n,\n\n(13)\n\nwhich is actually consistent with Eq.(11). Thus it can be found\n|\u01eb| = 1/\u01ebE .\n\n(14)\n\nThus the slowly expanding background |\u01eb| \u226b 1, which here is described by a conformal field\ntheory conformally coupled to gravity, is conformally dual to the inflationary background\n\u01ebE \u226a 1.\nThe curvature perturbation R and the tensor perturbation hij are actually conformal\ninvariant. Here, we will prove it in detail, which helps to clarify what determines the scale\ninvariance of the perturbations.\n1/\u01ebE\n\nIn inflationary background aE \u223c tE\n\n, the results of the primordial perturbations gener-\n\nated are familiar, which have been listed in Table I. In its conformal dual background given\nby Eq.(2), the case is slightly complicated. We will calculate R and hij in this picture. The\n4\n\n\fquadratic action of curvature perturbation R for the most general single field, including the\nnonminimal coupling case [12],[13], is [14]\nZ\n\u0011\na2 QR \u0010 \u2032 2\nS2 \u223c d\u03b7d3 x 2\nR \u2212 c2R (\u2202R)2 ,\ncR\n\n(15)\n\nwhere QR > 0 and c2R > 0 are required to avoid the ghost and gradient instabilities. Thus\n\nthe equation of R is given by [15],[16],\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2032\u2032\nzR\n\u2032\u2032\n2 2\nuk = 0,\n(16)\nu k + cR k \u2212\nzR\n\u221a\n1/2\nafter uk \u2261 zR Rk is defined, where zR = 2aQR /cR and the prime is the derivative for \u03b7.\nThe scale invariance of R requires\n1/2\n\naQR\nzR \u223c\ncR\n\n1\nf or constant mode\n\u03b7\u2217 \u2212 \u03b7\nor (\u03b7\u2217 \u2212 \u03b7)2 f or increasing mode\n\u223c\n\n(17)\n(18)\n\nhas to be satisfied. In certain sense, both evolutions are dual [17]. Here, c2R is not changed.\n\nHowever, the changed c2R will alter the result [18],[19],[20],[21],[22],[23],[24],[25]. During slow\nevolution, the scale invariant curvature perturbation can be induced by either its constant\nmode [26],[27],[28],[29], or its increasing mode [30],[31], In inflation scenario, the scale invariant perturbation is induced by the constant mode of perturbation, thus in its dual slow\nexpansion, the perturbation certainly must be that induced by the constant mode.\nHere, c2R = 1 and QR =\n\n1\n\u03c62\n6|\u01eb|\n\nzR\n\n> 0 [7].

Here, if (14) is applied for Eq.(28), r obtained is just that of\ninflation with constant \u01ebE . Thus the inflation and the slow expansion have equal predictions,\nwhich are listed in Table I.\nThus it is obviously found that the scale invariance of primordial perturbations is determined by the conformal invariance of field theory in slowly expanding background. However,\nthis conformal field is actually a slightly deformed conformal field, there is a slight deviation of \u223c 1/|\u01eb| from the conformal invariance, which naturally brings a slight red tilt of the\nprimordial perturbation.\nIn [9],[32], the similar conformal field has been applied, though for a picture of slow\ncontraction. However, in [9], the field conformally coupled to the gravity is a light field, which\nhardly affect the cosmological evolution. While in [32],[33], though the conformal field is\ndominated, it is not conformally coupled with the gravity. Thus both fail to conformally dual\nto inflation. In [9],[32],[33], the conformal invariance is only related to the scale invariance\nof the perturbation of a light field. While here what the conformal invariance determines is\nthat of metric perturbations, which is adiabatically generated.\nThough the predictions of inflation picture and its dual slow expansion picture for the\nperturbations are indistinguishable, the evolutions of their backgrounds are completely different. The inflation spacetime is geodesically incomplete, which thus is initially singular\n[34]. However, in its conformally dual background, the case is different, the primordial universe is slowly expanding, which is asymptotical to a static state in infinite past, and thus\nis singular free. This is illustrated in Fig.1.\nThus this conformal duality might imply an alternative to the origin of observational\nuniverse. The primordial universe might be in a slowly expanding conformal phase, in which\nthe full theory depicting the universe is conformal invariant. As a result of the conformal\ninvariance of underlying theory, both the curvature perturbation and tensor perturbation\nemerged in this conformal phase are naturally scale invariant. When the conformal phase\nends, the energy of conformal field will be released to heat the universe. Here, the heating\nmechanism might be similar to that after inflation. However, after the heating, MP2 ef f =\nMP2 should be fastened, or there will be conflicts with observations, which will be studied\n7\n\n\fa\n\nslowexpansion\n\ninflation\n\nradiation\n\nH\nconformal\ndual\n\nt*\n\nFIG. 1:\n\nt\n\nThe evolutions of a and H in inflation picture (dashed line) and its conformally dual,\n\ni.e.slow expansion picture (solid line), respectively. Before t\u2217 , which is tE\u2217 for inflation, due to the\nrapidly change of MP ef f , both evolutions are completely different, in which t is from -infinity to\nt\u2217 while tE is from 0 to tE\u2217 , in term of Eq.(9), noting that the conformal time \u03b7 is same for both\nevolutions, which is from -infinity to \u03b7\u2217 . However, after t\u2217 , since MP ef f = MP is fastened, both\nevolutions coincide. t\u2217 is the heating time, after which the evolution of hot big bang model begins.\n\nelsewhere. Hereafter, the evolution of universe coincides with that of hot big bang model,\nsee Fig.1.\nHere, the picture is as if homological with pre big bang picture [35],[36]. However, there\nthe superinflationary expanding phase in string frame, which but is not the slow expansion,\nis conformally dual to a contracting phase. While here the conformal rescale of the slow\nexpanding phase is inflation, thus the scale invariance of the curvature perturbation and the\ntensor perturbation is simply obtained.\nHere, with Fig.1, it might be designed that this infinite past could be jointed to the\ninfinite latetime of previous universe. In principle, after doing this joint an infinite number\nof times, we will have a cyclic universe. Here, the infinite past is actually a conformally dual\nto inflation initial singularity. In this sense, this conformal duality might imply a feasible\nimplementing of the conformal cyclic cosmology [37], which is left for the aftertime.\nIn conclusion, we show that the inflationary background can be conformally dual to a\nslowly expanding background. We prove that the primordial curvature perturbation and\ntensor perturbation generated during both backgrounds are completely equal, and the scale\ninvariance of perturbations is determined by the conformal invariance of field theory in\nslowly expanding background. Though we only consider a simple case, we conjecture that\n\n8\n\n\fall inflation models can be conformally dual to a slightly deformed conformal field theory in\nslowly expanding background, which might imply that though the inflatons are diversified\nin diversified inflation models, all actually have a common origin, when being performed\nin its conformally dual background. In dual slow expansion, the primordial universe is\nasymptotical to a static state in infinite past, and thus is singular free. Here, this slowly\nexpanding phase is depicted by a conformal field theory, thus it might has a dual description\nof AdS5 gravity [38], which might be interesting for studying.\nAcknowledgments We thank Yi-Fu Cai, Taotao Qiu for discussions.
