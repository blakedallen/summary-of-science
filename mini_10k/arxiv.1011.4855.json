Cosmology: observations; large-scale structure of Universe;\n\n1. Introduction\nThe sample of Luminous Red Galaxies (LRG)\n(Eisenstein et al., 2001) from the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey (SDSS) (York et al., 2000) is considered to be\nthe best sample to study galaxy large scale structures.\nOne of the main features observed in the LRG sample\nfrom the final data release of the SDSS (Abazajian et al.,\n2009), is that the number density as a function of redshift\nn(z), usually called the \"selection function\", presents a\ncomplex behavior. Given that, by construction, the LRG\nsample should be volume-limited (Eisenstein et al., 2001;\nZehavi et al., 2005; Kazin et al., 2010) the behavior of\nn(z) is expected to be constant if galaxy distribution\nis close to uniform (up to Poisson noise and radial\nclustering). It is instead observed that the LRG sample\nn(z) shows an irregular and not constant behavior.\nAn explanation that it is usually given for this result\n(Zehavi et al., 2005; Kazin et al., 2010), is that the LRG\nsample is \"quasi\" volume limited, in that it does not\nshow a constant n(z). Thus, the features in n(z) are\nabsorbed in the properties of a selection function, which\nis unknown a priori, but that it is defined a posteriori\nas the difference between an almost constant n(z) and\nthe behavior observed. Clearly this explanation is unsatisfactory as it is given a posteriori and no independent\ntests have been provided to corroborate the hypothesis\nthat an important observational selection effect occurs in\n\nthe data, other than the behavior of n(z) itself. Indeed\na different possibility is that the behavior of n(z) is\ndetermined by intrinsic fluctuations in the distribution of\ngalaxies and not by selection effects1 .\nWe note that if (unknown) selection effects are considered to play a major role in this sample, the question that\nshould be addressed concerns the quality of the data. In\nthe original paper by Eisenstein et al. (2001) it is stated\nthat the sample is volume-limited up to z \u223c 0.38, modulo\nminor effects due to K+e corrections (i.e. K-corrections\nand luminosity evolution). To support that this is the case,\nn(z) was found, in the early SDSS LRG data (see their\nFigs.12-13), to be close to flat. However Eisenstein et al.\n(2005), by considering a much larger LRG sample, noted\nthat the comoving number density displays a close to\na constant behavior, \"although fluctuations are reaching\nabout the 30% peak-to-peak\" (see their Fig.1). More recently, by considering the LRG sample with the same selection in magnitude and redshift as the one considered by\nEisenstein et al. (2005), but from the final SDSS data release which is larger by a factor \u223c 3 in volume, Kazin et al.\n(2010) (see their Fig.1) noted that there are non-negligible\nvariations in n(z), that, as mentioned above, make diffi1\n\nNote that for z > 0.36 there is instead a clear selection\neffect due to the \"passage of the 4000 A break into the r\nband\" (Kazin et al., 2010). This is shown by a smooth redshiftdependent decrease of the redshift counts. For this reason we\nlimit our analysis to z = 0.36.\n\n\f2\n\nSylos Labini: Self-averaging properties and selection in the LRG sample\n\ncult to consider this sample as a purely volume limited\none.\nIn this paper we determine the probability density\nfunction (PDF) of conditional galaxy counts in spheres 2 .\nIn practice we study the statistical properties of the variable Ni (r), which is defined to be the number of galaxies\nin a sphere a radius r centered on the ith galaxy. This\nhas the advantage to provide a characterization of conditional fluctuations which is not affected by the geometrical constraints of the sample as n(z), which instead explores different volumes at different redshifts. In addition,\nby measuring the PDF in different regions of the sample\nwe can make a clear test to check whether fluctuations are\nself-averaging inside the sample. This is the fundamental\nproperty that fluctuations are required to have when an\naverage quantity is measured in a given sample.\nIndeed a spatial average is meaningful, in the sense\nthat it provides an estimation of the ensemble average\nproperty of the given statistics, only when fluctuations are\nstationary inside the sample (Sylos Labini et al., 2009a;\nSylos Labini and Baryshev, 2010). The breaking of selfaveraging properties can be generally due to two different\nreasons. On the one hand when a distribution is not statistically translational and/or rotational invariant, then the\nfluctuation properties depend on the specific position of\nthe volume in which they are measured. For instance, if\nthe distribution is spherically symmetric around a point,\nthen the relevant role is played by the distance R from\nthe center: fluctuations at different distances R have different properties and for this reason any volume average\nquantity, computed in regions large enough so that statistical properties (i.e., the local density) change significantly, do not give an useful information about the real\nproperties of the distribution. This same situation occurs\nwhen a distance-dependent observational selection effect\noccurs in the data as it can mimic the break of translational invariance.\nOn the other hand self-averaging properties can be broken when fluctuations, in a given sample, are too extended\nin space and have too large amplitude (Sylos Labini et al.,\n2009a,b). For instance when there are a few large scale\nstructures in given volume, or even a single one, which\ndominates the distribution then it is not possible to get\na meaningful estimation of an average quantity at large\nenough scales in the sample. This occurs precisely because the sample volume is not large enough to average between different large enough structures. This is a\nsystematic effect that sometimes is refereed to as cosmic\nvariance (Yang and Saslaw, 2010) but that is more appropriately defined as breaking of self-averaging properties (Sylos Labini et al., 2009a), as the concept of vari2\n\nConditional properties are local, and they do not require\nthe measurement of global statistical quantities on the sample scale. They are well defined both for spatially uniform\nand inhomogeneous distributions, while unconditional statistical quantities are well defined only for spatially homogeneous\nsystems (Gabrielli et al., 2005).\n\nance (which involves already the computation of an average quantity) maybe without statistical meaning in the\ncircumstances described above.\nThe breaking of self-averaging properties was found to\noccur in several volume-limited samples of the main galaxy\nsample (MGS) of the DR6-SDSS (Sylos Labini et al.,\n2009a). Indeed, it was found that at large enough scales,\ni.e. r > 30 Mpc/h, the PDF of conditional fluctuations\nshows systematic differences when it is measured in volumes located in different positions in the sample. That\nthis corresponds to the breaking of self-averaging properties and not the the breaking of statistical isotropy\nand/or homogeneity (for intrinsic or observational reasons) is shown by two facts. The first is that the difference\nbetween the PDF, measured into two volumes located at\nsmall and high redshifts, is not systematically the same.\nThat is, sometimes the PDF measured at low redshift\nis shifted toward smaller values and sometimes toward\nhigher values. As discussed by Sylos Labini and Baryshev\n(2010) the breaking of statistical translational invariance,\nas well as the effect of a redshift dependent selection effect, would be signed by a difference in the PDF at low\nand high redshift always in the same direction. Secondly,\nwhen the larger volumes provided by DR7-SDSS was considered (Antal et al., 2009), the PDF did not show the\nsame difference: this is a clear indication that the breaking\nof self-averaging properties is due to a systematic volumedependent effect. In addition, when self-averaging properties were found to be satisfied the PDF was found to be\nnicely fitted by a Gumbel function and its first and second\nmoments, the average conditional density and the conditional variance, were found to have a scaling behavior as\na function of distance. All these behaviors mark a clear\ndeparture from spatial uniformity (Antal et al., 2009).\nIn this paper we perform the test for self-averaging in\nthe LRG sample. In Sect.2 we recall the basic statistical\nelements which we use in the data analysis. The main features of the data are presented in Sect.3 while in Sect.4 we\nshow our results. We discuss our results in Sect.5 by comparing the results obtained here with the ones measured\nin the SDSS-MGS by Loveday (2004); Sylos Labini et al.\n(2009a,b); Yang and Saslaw (2010) and in the 2 degree field redshift survey (2dFGRS) by Sylos Labini et al.\n(2009c,d). In addition we critically consider the measurements of the conditional average density by Hogg et al.\n(2004), the assumptions entering in the determination of\nthe two-point correlation function (Kazin et al., 2010) and\nthe problem underlying the determination of the so-called\nbaryon acoustic peak (Eisenstein et al., 2005; Kazin et al.,\n2010; Mart\u0131\u0301nez, et al., 2009; Sylos Labini et al., 2009e).\nFinally we draw our conclusions in Sect.6.\n\n2. Statistical background\nAs it was discussed by Sylos Labini et al. (2009a,b);\nSylos Labini and Baryshev (2010) a simple test to determine whether a point distribution is self-averaging in a\ngiven sample of linear size Rs consists in studying the PDF\n\n\fSylos Labini: Self-averaging properties and selection in the LRG sample\n\nof conditional galaxy counts in spheres N (which contains,\nin principle, information about moments of any order) in\nsub-samples of linear size r < Rs placed in different and\nnon-overlapping spatial regions of the sample (that we call\nS1 , S2 , ...SN ). That the self-averaging property holds is\nshown by the fact that PSi (N ; r) is the same, modulo statistical fluctuations, in the different sub-samples, i.e.,\nPSi (N ; r) \u2248 PSj (N ; r) \u2200i 6= j .\n\n(1)\n\nOn the other hand, if determinations of PSi (N , r) in\ndifferent sample regions Si show systematic differences\nthen, as discussed above, the distribution is not selfaveraging because of the presence of non-averaged large\nscale structures or because it not statistically translational and/or rotational invariant (this includes the case\nin which a redshift dependent observational selection effect is present). When Eq.1 is not found to be satisfied\nin a given sample then the determinations of the spatial\naverages are sample-dependent implying that those statistical quantities do not represent the asymptotic properties of the given distribution (Sylos Labini et al., 2009a;\nSylos Labini and Baryshev, 2010).\nTo test self-averaging is necessary to employ statistical quantities that do not require the assumption of\nspatial homogeneity inside the sample and thus avoid\nthe normalization of fluctuations to the estimation of the\nsample average (Sylos Labini et al., 2009a). We therefore\nconsider the PDF of the stochastic variable defined by\nnumber of points Ni (r) contained in a sphere of radius\nr centered on the ith point. This depends on the scale\nr and on the spatial position of the ith sphere's center, namely its radial distance Ri from a given origin\n(in this case the Earth) and its angular coordinates \u03b1i .\nIntegrating over \u03b1i for fixed radial distance Ri , we obtain that Ni (r) = N (r; Ri ) (Sylos Labini et al., 2009a;\nAntal et al., 2009; Sylos Labini and Baryshev, 2010).\nIn Antal et al. (2009) we showed that the Gumbel distribution was a good fit to the data of the SDSS-MGS,\nmarking a clear departure from the Gaussian behavior expected for spatially uniform systems. The Gumbel distribution's PDF, at fixed r, is given by (see Antal et al.\n(2009) and references therein)\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0012\n1\nN \u2212\u03b1\nN \u2212\u03b1\nP (N ) = exp \u2212\n.\n(2)\n\u2212 exp \u2212\n\u03b2\n\u03b2\n\u03b2\nThe mean and the standard deviation (variance) of the\nGumbel distribution (Eq.2), depend on the scale r, and\nare given by\n\u03bc = \u03b1 + \u03b3\u03b2,\n\n\u03c3 2 = (\u03b2\u03c0)2 /6\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03b3 = 0.5772 . . . is the Euler constant.\n\n3. The data\nThe sample we consider in this paper is one of the samples\nprepared by Kazin et al. (2010). In particular we focus on\nthe so-called DR7-Dim, while we do not present results\n\n3\n\nfor the other samples, as the one denoted as bright that\ncontains too few galaxies for a reliable statistical analysis.\nThe metric distance R(z; \u03a9m , \u03a9\u039b ) from the redshift\nhas been computed by using the cosmological parameters\nwith values \u03a9m = 0.25 and \u03a9\u039b = 0.75.\nGiven that we exclude redshifts z > 0.36 and z < 0.16,\nthe distance limits are: Rmin = 465 Mpc/h and Rmax =\n1002 Mpc/h. The limits in R.A \u03b1 and Dec. \u03b4 considered\nare chosen in such a way that (i) the angular region does\nnot overlap with the irregular edges of the survey mask\nand (ii) the sample covers a contiguous sky area. Thus we\nhave chosen: \u03b1min = 130\u25e6 and \u03b1max = 240\u25e6; \u03b4min = 0\u25e6\nand \u03b4max = 50\u25e6 . The absolute magnitude is constrained\nin the range M \u2208 [\u221223.2, \u221221.2]. With these limits we find\nN = 41833 galaxies covering a solid angle \u03a9 = 1.471 sr.\n\n4. Results\nAs discussed in Sect.2 we study the statistical properties of\nthe random variable Ni (r) measuring the integrated number of points in a sphere of radius r around i = 1...M (r)\npoints. The number of points over which it is possible to\ncompute this quantity at the scale r, denoted as M (r), depends on the geometrical constraints of the sample as we\nconsider only spheres that are fully enclosed in the sample\nboundaries (see for details Sylos Labini et al. (2009a)). At\nfixed r we make an histogram of the M (r) values of Ni (r),\nwhich thus represents an estimation of the PDF P (N ; r)\nof conditional fluctuations.\nIn Fig.1 we show the behavior of the number density\nas a function of distance. There are two main features: (i)\na negative slope between 400 Mpc/h < r < 800 Mpc/h\n(i.e., 0.16 < z < 0.28) and (ii) a positive slope up to a local\npeak at r \u223c 950 Mpc/h (i.e., z \u223c 0.34). Additional features are present as peaks in the n(r) behavior at r \u223c 500\n(z \u223c 0.18) and r \u223c 650 Mpc/h (z \u223c 0.23). Note that if\nn(z) were constant we would expect a behavior similar\nto the one shown by the mock sample extracted from the\nHorizon simulation with the same geometry of the real\nLRG sample (Kim et al., 2010) (see Fig.1). This implies\nthat, by addressing the behavior of n(z) to unknown selection effects, it is implicitly assumed that the survey has\nlost more than the 20% (for n0 = 1.2 \u00d7 10\u22124 galaxies for\n(Mpc/h)\u22123 ) of the galaxies for observational problems.\nThis looks improbable (Eisenstein et al., 2001) although\na more careful investigation of the problem must be addressed. Note also that the deficit of galaxies would not be\nexplained by a smooth redshift-dependent effect (as it occurs for z > 0.36 - see Fig.1 of Kazin et al. (2010)) rather\nthe selection must be strongly redshift dependent as the\nbehavior of n(z) is not monotonic. These facts point, but\ndo not proof, toward an origin of the n(z) behavior due\nto the intrinsic fluctuations in the galaxy distribution.\nThe analysis of fluctuations by studying n(z) shows\nclearly that the observed behavior is incompatible with\nmodel predictions. However the redshift distribution provides only a rough analysis of fluctuations, especially because it is not an average quantity and because it samples\n\n\fSylos Labini: Self-averaging properties and selection in the LRG sample\n1.8e-04\n\n0.03\n\n1.6e-04\n\n0.025\n\n1.4e-04\n\n0.02\n\nP(N;r=50)\n\nn(R)\n\n4\n\n1.2e-04\n\nLRG\nHorizon\n-1\nr\n\n8.0e-05\n\n0.005\n\n500\n\n700\n\n600\n\n800\n\n900\n\n1000\n\nR (Mpc/h)\n\nN\n50\n\n150\n\n200\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\nr=50\n\n350\n\n400\n0.01\n\nr=100\n\n0.008\n0.006\n0.004\n\nf(N,r)\n\nf(r,N)\n\n0.02\n0.015\n0.01\n0.002\n\n0.005\n0\n\n0\n\n0.004\n\nr=150\n\n0.0025\n\nr=200\n\n0.002\n0.0015\n\n0.002\n\nf(N,r)\n\nf(N,r)\n\n0.003\n\n0.001\n0.001\n0.0005\n0\n1200\n\n1400\n\n1600\n\nN\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\nFig. 3.

For this reason we determine\nthe statistical properties of the stochastic variable Ni (r)\npreviously defined, which allows us to compute the full\nPDF in sub-samples of equal volume. In Fig.2 we report\nthe PDF at different scales in the LRG sample, together\nwith the best fit with Eq.2, which provides a reasonably\ngood fit. A quantification of the difference of the measured\nPDF from the Gumbel or Gaussian behaviors is difficult\nfor the problems discussed below.\nLet us now pass to the self-averaging test described in\nSect.2. To this aim we divide the sample into two nonoverlapping regions of same volume, one at low (L) redshifts and the other at high (H) redshifts. We then measure the PDF PL (N ; r) and PH (N ; r) in the two volumes.\n\nGiven that the total number of points is not very large\n(i.e., M (r) \u223c 104 ), in order to improve the statistics especially for large sphere radii, we allow a partial overlapping\nbetween the two sub-samples, so that galaxies in the L (H)\nsub-sample counts also galaxies in the H (L) sub-sample.\nThis overlapping clearly can only smooth out differences\nbetween PL (N ; r) and PH (N ; r). Results are shown in\nFigs.3-6 for r = 50, 100, 150, 200 Mpc/h respectively. One\nmay note that for r = 50 Mpc/h the two determinations\nare much closer than for lager sphere radii for which there\nis actually a noticeable difference in the whole shape of the\nPDF 3 . The fact that PH (N ; r) is shifted toward smaller\nvalues than PL (N ; r) is related to the decaying behavior\nof the redshift counts (see Fig.1): most of the galaxies at\nlow redshifts see a relatively larger local density than the\ngalaxies at higher redshift.\nTo clarify the features expected in LCDM models, we\nhave done the same analysis in realization of the LRG\nsample from the Horizon mock samples Kim et al. (2010).\nIn Figs.7-8 we report the PDF computed in the full sample P (N ; r) and in the two half-samples PL (N ; r) and\nPH (N ; r) as done for the real sample. One may note\nthat the PDF is much more regular and has a bell-shape.\nIndeed the Gaussian fit is reasonably good. A complementary aspects of these features is provided, as discussed\nabove, by the behavior of the radial density that is almost constant but noisy, where in this case fluctuations\nare only due to Poisson noise and radial clustering (see\n3\nThe Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test (Press et al., 2007) allows,\nin general, to make a statistical test to measure the distance\nbetween two cumulative PDF. In all cases discussed here, we\nfind that both the Gaussian and the Gumbel functions do not\nfit the data at a reasonable level of confidence. In addition\nwhen applying the same test to study whether the data from\nthe H and S samples are drawn from the same distribution, we\nalso find that the answer is in the negative.\n\n\fSylos Labini: Self-averaging properties and selection in the LRG sample\n0.008\n\n5\n\n0.006\n\nPL(N;r)\nPH(N;r)\n\nP(N;r)\nPH(N;r)\nPL(N;r)\n\n0.005\n\nP(N;r=100)\n\nP(N;r=100)\n\n0.006\n\n0.004\n\n0.004\n\n0.003\n\n0.002\n\n0.002\n0.001\n\n0\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n0\n400\n\n600\n\n500\n\n700\n\n600\n\nFig. 4.

These results are clearly expected from a simple\ntheoretical analysis: LCDM models are such that nonlinear clustering occurs only at small scales r < 10 Mpc/h\nand thus the distribution properties at \u223c 100 Mpc/h\nare characterized by Gaussianity, small amplitude fluctuations and weak two-point correlations (see discussion in\nSylos Labini et al. (2009a)).\nAs a final remark, we note that when applying a random selection to the mock catalog, in such a way to get\nthe same n(z) of the real data, the results of our tests\nare compatible with the data. Thus, a possible, but as\nmentioned, unsatisfactory, conclusion is that the LRG is\ncompatible with the mock catalog. We stress again that\nthis conclusion is based on the assumption that an important selection effect, which is not smooth with redshift,\noccurs in the definition of the sample.\n\n\f6\n\nSylos Labini: Self-averaging properties and selection in the LRG sample\n2000\nVL1\nVL2\nVL3\nVL4\nVL5\nLRG\n\nn(R)\n\n1500\n\n1000\n\n500\n\n0\n\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\nR (Mpc/h)\n\nFig. 9.

Discussion\nWe have discussed that the number density as a function redshift n(z) of the LRG sample shows, for a wide\nredshift range, a decreasing behavior as a function of redshift, followed by a sharp increase around z \u223c 0.36. A\ndifferent behavior was detected by the n(z) of the bright\ngalaxies in the MGS. In particular Loveday (2004) found\nthat the number density of bright galaxies increases by a\nfactor \u2248 3 as redshift increases from z = 0 to z = 0.3.\nThis is shown, for instance, by the increase of n(R) up tp\nz \u223c 0.2 in the two volume limited samples VL4 and VL5\nof the MGS shown in Fig.9 (from the Sylos Labini et al.\n(2009a)). At smaller scales the differential number density\nshows a fluctuating behavior. To explain the rise of the\ndifferential number density in the deepest samples, which\ncontain in average the brightest galaxies of the MGS, a significant evolution in the luminosity and/or number density\nof galaxies at redshifts z < 0.3 as been invoked (Loveday,\n2004). On the other hand, Sylos Labini et al. (2009a) by\nmeasuring the PDF of galaxy counts in spheres, concluded\nthat the volume-limited samples of the MGS, extracted\nfrom the SDSS sixth data release, are characterized by\nthe breaking of self-averaging properties for scales r > 30\nMpc/h and that the increase in the bright galaxies number density is interpreted as an effect due to large scale\ninhomogeneities.\nIn addition, for galaxies with magnitudes around M \u2217\nit was subsequently shown by Antal et al. (2009) that selfaveraging properties are verified when the larger volumes\nof the final data release of SDSS is considered. This actually poofs that the breaking of self-averaging properties is due to a finite volume effect and not to galaxy\nevolution (Sylos Labini and Baryshev, 2010). Moreover in\n\nthe deeper samples, containing the brightest galaxies, selfaveraging properties were found not to be satisfied even in\nthe SDSS final data release (Sylos Labini and Baryshev,\n2010). In that case, in agreement with Loveday (2004),\nit was observed a growth of radial density rather than a\ndecrease. In summary, these behaviors support the conclusion that galaxies from the MGS of the SDSS are\nnot compatible with spatial homogeneity at scales \u223c 100\nMpc/h. A similar conclusion was drawn from the analysis\nof the 2dFGRS by Sylos Labini et al. (2009c,d). Recently\nYang and Saslaw (2010) found that cosmic variance in the\nSDSS causes the counts-in-cells distributions in different\nquadrants to differ from each other by up to 20%, a result\nwhich corroborate the results discussed here.\nWe note that the same systematic effects discussed\nfor the behavior of conditional fluctuations similarly affect the determinations of the two-point correlation function and clearly the detection of the so-called baryon\nacoustic oscillations (Eisenstein et al., 2005; Kazin et al.,\n2010; Mart\u0131\u0301nez, et al., 2009). It was indeed shown by\nSylos Labini et al. (2009e) that major systematic effects\nare present in the estimators of \u03be(r) and that the variance\nestimated from the sample itself is much larger than the\none deduced from the analysis of mock catalogs, making\nthe detection of the baryon acoustic oscillations statistically unreliable.\nInstead of investigating the origin of the fluctuating behavior of n(z), Kazin et al. (2010) focused their attention\non the effect of the radial counts on the determination of\nthe two-point correlation function \u03be(r). In particular, they\nproposed mainly two different tests to study what is the\neffect of n(z) on the determination of \u03be(r). The first test\nconsists in taking a mock LRG sample, constructed from a\ncosmological N-body simulation of the LCDM model, and\nby applying a redshift selection which randomly excludes\npoints in such a way that the resulting distribution has\nthe same n(z) of the real sample. Then one can compare\n\u03be(r) obtained in the original mock and in redshift-sampled\nmock. Kazin et al. (2010) find that there is a good agreement between the two. This shows that the particular kind\nof redshift-dependent random sampling considered for the\ngiven distribution, does not alter the determination of the\ncorrelation function. In other words this shows that, under the assumption that the observed LRG sample is a\nrealization of the mock LCDM simulation, the n(z) does\nnot affect the result. However, if we want to test whether\nthe LRG sample has the same statistical properties of the\nmock catalog, we cannot clearly proof (or disproof) this\nhypothesis by assuming a priori that this is true.\nThe second test consists in computing \u03be(r) in the\ndata, by using a pair-counting method which measures two-point correlations by using a random distribution as reference and by comparing the number\nof data-data pairs with the number of data-random\nand/or random-random pairs (Davis and Peebles, 1983;\nLanday and Szalay, 1993). Then, to include the variations\nof n(z) in the data one considers a random sample that\nis not a purely Poisson distribution. Instead, the random\n\n\fSylos Labini: Self-averaging properties and selection in the LRG sample\n\nsample is generated so that it has the same n(z) behavior\nas in the data. This means that in each redshift shell at\ndistance z and of thickness \u2206z the distribution is Poisson\nwith the same density n(z) as observed. This test shows\nonly that a random sample modified in such a way, does\nnot alter the determination of \u03be(r) (as it is found by\nKazin et al. (2010)). Instead, it does not show that the\nfeatures in the observed n(z) behavior are taken into account by the fact that the random sample has the same\nfeatures in the redshift counts.\nThe behavior of the average conditional properties\nis clearly ill-defined as long as self-averaging properties\nare not found to be stable: indeed the average conditional density is just the first moment of the PDF. In\nSylos Labini et al. (2009a) we have discussed that up to\n\u223c 30 Mpc/h the average conditional density shows approximately a \u223c r\u22121 behavior, while in Antal et al. (2009)\nwe find that there is an apparent change of slope at larger\nscales where the average conditional density decays as\n\u223c r\u22120.3 approximately up to 100 Mpc/h. A change of\nslope at \u223c 30 Mpc/h from \u223c r\u22121 was found by Hogg et al.\n(2004) in a preliminary sample of the LRG. However they\nclaimed that a clear transition to a flat behavior, signaling uniformity, was reached at \u223c 70 Mpc/h. With the\npresent data, which represent an improvement of almost a\nfactor 3 in volume with respect to the data considered\nby Hogg et al. (2004), because of the breaking of selfaveraging properties, we are not able to make a reliable\ndetermination of the average conditional density at scales\nof the order of \u223c 100 Mpc/h. However, we note that our\nresults are not compatible with a transition to uniformity\nat those scales.\n\n6. Conclusions\nThe number density as a function of redshift in the final\nLRG sample from the SDSS (Kazin et al., 2010) shows\nan irregular and mainly decaying behavior which cannot\nbe simply explained by a smooth redshift-dependent selection. We have discussed that the behavior of n(z) is closely\nrelated to the properties of fluctuations in this sample. We\nconclude that these are not self-averaging and thus they do\nnot allow us to make a precise statement on the behavior\nof volume average quantities, as the average conditional\ndensity or the two-point correlation function. Either the\nbehavior of n(z) is determined by intrinsic fluctuations in\nthe LRG distribution which are in amplitude and spatial\nextension much larger than the ones expected in LCDM\nmodels, or there are major observational selection effects\nintervening in the definition of the LRG sample. For this\nreason we conclude that forthcoming galaxy samples, as\nthe data from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey\n(White el al., 2010), with more controlled selection effects,\nwill hopefully clarify the situation.\nAcknowledgements.
