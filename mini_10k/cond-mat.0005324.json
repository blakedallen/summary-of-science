Both perfectly elastic and viscoelastic material behaviours are considered in\nlinear stability analysis performed here. These analyses indicate that for sufficiently soft\n(shear modulus between 1 and 10 MPa) and nearly incompressible films (Poisson's ratio\nclose to 0.5), bifurcations are possible, i. e., the surface of the film becomes non-planar.\nThe modes of bifurcation and rates of growth of perturbations are determined as a function\nof material parameters. The results of this study are of significance in understanding the\nadhesive properties between a soft material (such as rubber) and a comparatively rigid solid\n(such as steel), and the behaviour of soft solid films in an electric field.\n\nInstabilities and pattern formation in thin solid and\nliquid films are of interest both from a scientific and\ntechnological view point. Morphological instabilities\nin thin liquid films occur due to causes such as competition between capillary forces and van der Waals\ninteractions [1] or an external electric field [2] and can\noften lead to dewetting leading to interesting patterns.\nMorphological instabilities are also common in solid\nfilms; for example, in stressed solid films the strain energy drives the surface roughening in competition with\nthe surface energy with surface mass diffusion being\nthe dissipative mechanism[3, 4].\nAnalysis of interacting thin films has hitherto been\nrestricted to fluid films. Here, we pose the question of\nstability of a thin solid film bonded to a rigid substrate\nwhose free surface experiences an effective force. This\nforce may arise from any of the various causes such as\na van der Waals interaction with another contacting\nsurface nearby and/or with the substrate, an external\nelectric field, etc. The theoretical analysis presented\nin this paper indicates that for a soft and nearly incompressible solid thin film, instabilities are possible\nand that the film \"buckles\". Physically, this instability occurs because it is possible, for sufficiently large\ninteraction forces, to reduce the net potential energy\nof the system (the elastic strain energy and the surface\nenergy of the film + potential energy of interaction of\nthe surface) by a periodic non homogeneous deformation in the film. We believe that these results could\nbe useful in understanding phenomena of adhesion between materials (such as rubber and steel), behaviour\nof thin films in an electric field etc.\nThe system considered here is shown in fig. 1 \u2013 a\nfilm of height h bonded to a rigid substrate described\nby coordinates (x1 , x2 ) such that surface of the film\nS interacting with external agency has x2 = 0 and\nthat bonded with the rigid substrate has x2 = \u2212h.\nWe restrict attention to plane strain deformations of\n\nx2\n\nn\n\nx1\nFilm\n\nh\n\nSubstrate\n\nFIG. 1: Film bonded to a rigid substrate.

It is this class of materials that the\nfocus of this paper. Nevertheless, results are presented\nfor all values of \u03bd for the sake of completeness.\nBifurcations: What are the conditions (on Y, \u03bc, \u03bd, h, \u03b3)\nfor another solution (inhomogeneous state) to exist? If\nsuch a solution exists, it can be taken to be of the form\nuh + u, where the symbol u now stands for a \"bifurcation\" displacement field. This bifurcation field must\nsatisfy the equilibrium equations in the bulk and the\nrigid boundary condition at the film substrate interface, just as the homogeneous solution. On the surface\nof the film at x2 = 0, the bifurcation field satisfies (here\n\u03c3 is the additional stresses due to u),\n\n1\n0\n\nhYm\n2(1 \u2212 \u03bd)\n=\n\u03bc\n(1 \u2212 2\u03bd)\n\n2\n\n1\n\n\u03c3 * n = \u03b3u2,11 n + Y (u * n)n,\n0\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\ninstead of (4). To investigate the existence of a nontrivial solution to the problem defined above, the bifurcation fields are assumed to have the form\n\n10\n\nhY/\u03bc\n\n(b)\nFIG. 2: Bifurcations modes (hk) as a function of hY /\u03bc\nfor various values of \u03bd with \u03b3/\u03bch = 0. (b)Bifurcations\nmodes (hk) as a function of hY /\u03bc for various values of\n\u03b3/\u03bch with \u03bd = 0.4.\nThe equilibrium stress field \u03c3 in the film (which minimises the potential energy (2) over an appropriate\nlength of the film) satisfies the equilibrium equation\n\u2207 * \u03c3 = 0 in V and the boundary condition\n\u03c3 * n = \u03b3u2,11 n + F\u25e6 n + Y (u * n)n\n\n(4)\n\non S. Taking the film to be an isotropic linear elastic\nsolid with shear modulus \u03bc and Poisson's ratio \u03bd, gives\na standard expression for the strain energy density [5]\nwith a resulting expression for the stress tensor expressed in terms of the gradient of displacement. Thus\nthe problem can be cast into a boundary value problem\nfor the unknown displacement field with the boundary\ncondition of vanishing displacements at x2 = \u2212h at the\nthe film substrate interface in addition to (4).\nThe Homogeneous Solution: A solution to the above\nboundary value problem exists such that the stresses\nin the film are equal everywhere. This homogeneous\nsolution (uh ) is uh1 = 0 everywhere, and uh2 has a linear\nvariation with x2 starting from 0 at x2 = \u2212h, i.e.,\nuh2 (x1 , 0) = u\u25e6 = \u0010\n\nFo\n2(1\u2212\u03bd)\u03bc\n(1\u22122\u03bd)h\n\n\u2212Y\n\n\u0011.\n\n(7)\n\n(5)\n\nFor the case when \u03bd = 0.5, i. e., the incompressible\n\nuj (x1 , x2 ) = eikx1 uj (x2 )\n\n(8)\n\nwhere k is a real positive wavenumber. The problem\nof finding nontrivial bifurcation fields can be cast into\nthe problem of finding those values of k such that the\nfunctions uj (x2 ) are nontrivial. It can be shown that (a\ndetailed account will be published elsewhere) nontrivial\nbifurcation fields of the form (8) exist for those values\nof k that satisfy the equation\n\u0010 \u0002\n\nk 4e2hk hk2 (h\u03bc \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03bd)\u03b3) + (e4hk \u2212 1)k\u03b3(3 \u2212 7\u03bd + 4\u03bd 2 )\n\n+\u03bc (3 \u2212 4\u03bc)(1 + e4hk ) \u2212 2e2hk (5 \u2212 12\u03bd + 8\u03bd 2 )\n\n\u0010\n\n(1 \u2212 \u03bd) (3 \u2212 4\u03bd)(e4hk \u2212 1) \u2212 4hke2hk\n\n\u0002\n\n\u0003\u0011\n\n=Y\n\n\u0001\u0003 \u0011.\n\n(9)\n\nThis relation is valid for the incompressible case as\nwell (i. e., when \u03bd = 0.5). Real roots of (9) are sought\nwhen Y < Ym which is the range of Y for which the\nhomogeneous solution is valid.\nWe first focus attention on the case when \u03b3 vanishes.\nFig. 2a depicts graphically the solution to (9), i. e., for\na given value of \u03bd, the values of k that solve (9) are\nplotted as a function of Y (hY /\u03bc in non-dimensional\nterms). The important results may be noted: (i) There\nare no bifurcation modes for any value of \u03bd when\nhY /\u03bc < 2. (ii) For all values of \u03bd, k = 0 is a bifurcation mode when Y = Ym . (iii)When \u03bd \u2264 0.25,\nthere are no bifurcation modes for Y < Ym . (iv) When\n\u03bd > 0.25, there are two modes starting from a critical\n\n\f3\n\n2\u03bd(4\u03bd \u2212 1)\n\u03b3m\n=\n,\n\u03bch\n3(1 \u2212 2\u03bd)2\n\n(10)\n\na result which is pertinent when \u03bd > 0.25. The curve\nfor \u03b3/\u03bch = 4.0 for the case of \u03bd = 0.4 shown in fig. 2,\ngraphically illustrates this point. If \u03b3 > \u03b3m , then there\nare no bifurcations in the physically meaningful range\nY < Ym .\nA more detailed analysis gives the following formulae\nfor Yc and kc as a function of \u03b3 and \u03bd when \u03b3/\u03bch \u226a 1\nand \u03bd \u2192 0.5:\nh\n\u03b3\nYc (\u03bd, \u03b3/\u03bch) = 6.22 \u2212 10.46(1 \u2212 2\u03bd) + 4.49 ,\n\u03bc\n\u03bch\n\u03b3\nhkc (\u03bd, \u03b3/\u03bch) = 2.12 \u2212 2.86(1 \u2212 2\u03bd) \u2212 2.42 .

When\nthe film is incompressible hYc /\u03bc = 6.22 and the corresponding bifurcation mode has hkc = 2.12. For this\ncase bifurcations are possible for all values of Y greater\nthan 6.22\u03bc/h, with two possible values of k as shown\nin the fig. 2a.\nNext, we consider the case when \u03b3 6= 0. Fig. 2b\nshows a plot of the possible wavenumbers of bifurcation\nmodes for various values of \u03b3 with \u03bd = 0.4. The key\neffect of the surface energy on the bifurcation modes\nare noted as follows: (i) Surface energy inhibits bifurcation, in that a larger value of Yc is effected with a non\nzero value of \u03b3. The critical mode kc decreases with increasing \u03b3. Both of these results are as expected since\na larger value of k implies a larger energy penalty in\nterms of surface energy. (ii) As \u03b3 gets larger Yc approaches Ym . In fact, it can be shown that Yc equals\nYm when \u03b3 = \u03b3m where\n\n\u03b3/\u03bch = 0.0\n\u03b3/\u03bch = 0.5\n\u03b3/\u03bch = 1.0\n\n1.6\n\n1.2\n\n\u03bd = 0.5\n0.8\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\nhY/\u03bc\n\n(b)\nFIG. 3: Bifurcations modes (hk) as a function of hY /\u03bc\nfor various values of \u03bd with \u03b3/\u03bch = 0. (b)Bifurcations\nmodes (hk) as a function of hY /\u03bc for various values of\n\u03b3/\u03bch with \u03bd = 0.4.\nFrom (14) it is evident that the time dependent homogeneous solution tends to the elastic homogeneous\nsolution as t \u2192 \u221e when Y < Ym . If Y > Ym , the\npresent analysis indicates that the homogeneous solution blows up as t \u2192 \u221e.\nGrowth of Perturbations: Just as in the case of the\nelastic film, it is of interest to investigate the growth of\nperturbations of the homogeneous solution. The perturbations u are assumed to be of the form\nuj (x1 , x2 , t) = eikx1 uj (x2 )e\u03c9t .\n\n(15)\n\nFor a given k, the rate of growth \u03c9 is determined by\ninsisting that the the perturbation satisfies equilibrium\nequations and boundary conditions and that they be\nnontrivial. The relation between \u03c9 and k can be obtained by replacing \u03bc and \u03bd in (9) respectively by \u03bc\u2217\nand \u03bd \u2217 where,\n\u03bc\u2217 = \u03bc + \u03b7\u03c9,\n\n\u03bd\u2217 =\n\n3\u03bd\u03bc \u2212 (1 \u2212 2\u03bd)\u03b7\u03c9\n.\n3\u03bc + (1 \u2212 2\u03bd)\u03b7\u03c9\n\n(16)\n\nThis procedure results in a cubic equation for \u03c9.\nThe solution of this equation is obtained by numerical means.\nThe solution for \u03c9 indicates that for Yc < Y < Ym ,\nall perturbation modes with wavenumbers between the\ntwo bifurcation modes given by the elastic analysis\n\n\f4\n10\n\n2 ( 1 - \u03bd)\n(1 - 2 \u03bd)\n\n8\n\nhY/\u03bc\n\nII\nIII\n\n6\n4\n\nh Yc(\u03bd,\u03b3/\u03bch)\n\u03bc\n\n2\n\nI\n0\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n\u03bd\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\nFIG. 4: The stable and unstable regions in the parameter space.

Region III: Homogeneous solution \"unphysical\".\nare unstable i. e., \u03c9 for these modes are positive. Indeed, there is a mode with wavenumber (km ) between\nwavenumbers of the two elastic bifurcation modes such\nthat the rate of growth (\u03c9) is a maximum. Fig. 3(a)\nshows a plot of km as a function of Y (Yc \u2264 Y \u2264 Ym )\nfor various values of \u03bd (with \u03b3/\u03bch = 0). When \u03bd < 0.5,\nthe value of km starts at kc when Y = Yc and monotonically falls with increasing Y . For the case of \u03bd = 0.5,\nkm = kc for all values of Y . When \u03b3 6= 0, km is smaller\nas is evident from fig. 3(b); the effect of surface energy\non the fastest growing mode becomes increasingly less\nsignificant for large values of Y . Just as in (11), an\nanalytic result can be derived for km for small values\nof \u03b3/\u03bch, \u03bd \u2192 0.5 and h(Y \u2212 Yc )/\u03bc \u226a 1:\nhkm (\u03bd,\n\n\u03b3\n\u03b3\n) = hkc (\u03bd,\n)\n\u03bch\n\u03bch\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03b3\n+ 0.39\n\u2212 0.46(1 \u2212 2\u03bd)\n\u03bch\n\n\u0013\n\nh\n(Y \u2212 Yc )\n\u03bc\n\n(17)\n\nInstability in a thin film whose surface experiences\nforces depends on three key sets of non-dimensional parameters namely the Poisson's ratio \u03bd, the normalised\nsecond derivative of the interaction potential hY /\u03bc and\nthe normalised surface energy \u03b3/\u03bch. The whole picture of stability and bifurcation in this system and its\ndependence on the nondimensional parameters can be\ndepicted pictorially as shown in fig. 4. Region I in fig. 4\nis where the homogeneous solution is unique and stable\nwhile region marked III in the figure corresponds to\nthe case when the homogeneous solution is \"unphysical\", i.e., this analysis is not adequate. Region II is\nthe most interesting \u2013 this corresponds to nearly incompressible material behaviour. In this region the\nhomogeneous solution is unstable, with two possible\nelastic bifurcation modes; a viscoelastic analysis predicts a fastest growing mode with a wave vector that\nlies between the two elastic bifurcation modes.\nWe now turn to specific cases of the type of sys-\n\ntem considered in this paper. First, we consider a\nrigid contactor interacting with the film via van der\nWaals forces. Assuming that the contactor is at a\ndistance d above the undeformed surface of the film,\nthe interaction potential U can can be taken to be\nA\nA\nU (u * n) = 12\u03c0(uA\n*n\u2212d)2 with F\u25e6 = 6\u03c0d3 , Y = 2\u03c0d4 .\nTaking the film to be made of rubber (\u03bc = 1 MPa,\n\u03bd = 0.5, \u03b3 = 0.1J/m2 ) and h = 1micron with A \u2248 1eV.\nWhen d = 10nanometers we get hY /\u03bc = 1.6 and for\nd = 5nanometers, hY /\u03bc = 25.6. Since the latter value\nis greater than hYc /\u03bc which is 6.63 when \u03b3/\u03bch = 0.1\n(which is the present case), it is clear that the condition for bifurcation will be achieved as d is reduced\nfrom 10nm to 5nm. Thus as the contactor approaches\nthe film, the film would buckle. This implies that the\ncontact that forms between the contactor surface and\nthe film will not be planar. We are not aware of any\nexperimental work that can corroborate our results.\nWe do, however, hope that the contents of this paper\nwill be useful in designing experiments to verify our\nconclusions.\nThe second case considered is that of a film interacting with an external electric field. The system consists\nof two plates separated by a distance d; the bottom\nplate is coated with a nearly incompressible polymeric\nfilm of height h. A potential difference of V is applied\nbetween the two plates. The quantity of interest is the\nvalue of the gap thickness d \u2212 h at which instability\noccurs in the film. The potential of interaction for this\n\u03b5 \u03b5p V 2\ncase is given by U (u * n) = 2(\u03b5p d\u2212(\u03b5p0\u22121)(h+\nu*n)) where\n\u03b50 is the permittivity of free space, \u03b5p is the dielectric\nconstant of the polymer. Taking the mechanical properties of the polymer to be same as in the previous case,\nand taking \u03b5p = 3, we get that the critical gap thickness\nd \u2212 h of 0.05micron for a film of height 0.1micron with\nthe applied voltage of 100V. A gap thickness smaller\nthan 0.05micron will cause the film to buckle. It is evident that large electric fields are required to cause the\ninstability.\nWe do wish to point out that this analysis is based\non a linearised model, and will only provide the modes\nof instability, i. e., the wavelength of surface undulation and not the magnitude. A nonlinear analysis is\nrequired to obtain such a quantity and will be pursued\nin subsequent papers.\nREFERENCES\n\u2020\n\nvbshenoy@iitk.ac.in; Department of Mechanical\nEngineering\n\u2021\nashutos@iitk.ac.in; Department of Chemical Engineering\n[1] S.
