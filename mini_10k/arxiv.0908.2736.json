In difference with uniform two-dimensional and three-dimensional systems, the temperature of superfluid\ntransition Tc in the network is much smaller than the degeneracy temperature Td . It is shown that a\ncrossover into a quasi superfluid state occurs in the temperature interval between Tc and Td . Below\nthe crossover temperature the time of decay of the flow increases exponentially under decrease in\nthe temperature. The crossover has a continuous character and the crossover temperature does not\ndepend on the density of dislocations.\nPACS numbers: 67.80.bd\n\nForty years ago Andreev and Lifshitz1 predicted the\npossibility of realization of a ground state of quantum\ncrystals with the number of sites larger than the number\nof atoms. Empty sites in such a state are called zero-point\nvacancies. In crystals consisting of Bose atoms zero-point\nvacancies behave as Bose quasiparticles and at low temperatures they become superfluid ones. Therefore the\nphenomenon predicted by Andreev and Lifshitz is called\nthe supersolids. In 1970s the problem of supersolids was\naddressed a number of theoretical papers2,3,4,5,6 , but numerous experimental efforts to discover this phenomenon\nfailed (see Ref. 7). The situation has changed completely\nafter the experiment of Kim and Chan8 in which a nonclassical rotational inertia (NCRI) of 4 He crystal was observed below certain critical temperature. NCRI means\nthat the 4 He crystal does not rotate as a rigid body, but\ncertain (superfluid) fraction of atoms is decoupled from\nthe rotation. Further experiments9,10,11,12,13 confirmed\nthe NCRI effect. It was established9,10,11,12,13,14 that the\nNCRI is not an intrinsic property of 4 He crystals. The\namount of fraction decoupled from the oscillations (rotation) depends considerably on the degree of disorder in\nthe crystal lattice, in particular, it becomes much smaller\nafter annealing. A correlation between supersolid features and disorder was also observed in the direct flow\nexperiment15 . A common explanation of the correlation\nbetween disorder and supersolid behavior is that zeropoint vacancies may emerge only at extended crystal lattice defects, presumable, in dislocation cores. The idea\non superfluid behavior of dislocations was put forward in\nRef. 16 (originally, in a context of description of anomalous plastic properties of parahydrogen17). In Ref. 18\nthis idea was applied for the explanation of NCRI. In 18\nand in the following19 papers superfluid properties of dislocations were demonstrated by the first principles Monte\nCarlo calculations. A combined (dislocation network plus\nbulk) mechanism of supersolidity was considered in Ref.\n20. The role of dislocations in this mechanism is similar to one for the enhancement of superconductivity by\ndislocations21 .\nIn this Rapid Communication we study the specifics\n\nof the superfluid transition in the network of onedimensional (1D) wires and arrive at the following conclusion. The temperature of the superfluid transition in\nthe network is quite small and it depends on the length of\nsegments of the network. At the same time, a crossover\ninto a quasi superfluid state (a state with exponentially\nlarge time of relaxation of a flow) takes place at much\nlarger temperatures, and the crossover temperature does\nnot depend on the length of the segments. It is just\nthe behavior observed in torsion experiments where the\ntransition is continuous, and it occurs in the temperature\ninterval independent of the NCRI fraction.\nThe problem of the superfluid transition in a dislocation network was studied in Ref. 22. It was shown that\nin the two-dimensional (2D) network the critical temperature is proportional to the inverse length of the segment. Let us derive the result of Ref. 22 using the following simple arguments. For a 2D uniform medium the\nBerezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) critical temperature is determined by the equation Tc = \u03c0h\u03042 ns2 (Tc )/2m,\nwhere ns2 is the two-dimensional superfluid density. The\nBKT transition is connected with the energy of a vortex\npair diverges logarithmically at large distances between\nthe vortices. At such distances the difference between a\nuniform medium and a network is not important. Therefore, the critical temperature for the network is given by\nthe BKT equation in which the uniform density ns2 is\nreplaced with the average 2D superfluid density n\u03042 . The\nlatter quantity can be expressed through the 1D density\nof zero-point vacancies n and the length of the segment\nof the network l. For the quadratic network n\u03042 = 2n/l,\nand the critical temperature is Tc = \u03c0h\u03042 n/ml (m is the\neffective mass of zero-point vacancies).\nIn Ref. 23 a microscopic model of Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of non-interacting zero-point vacancies\nin a three-dimensional (3D) network was considered. It\nwas shown that the BEC temperature depends significantly on the transparency of vertices (intersections of\ndislocations), and the highest value, reached at high\ntransparency, is TBEC \u2248 3h\u03042 n/2ml, so the superfluid critical temperatures in 3D and 2D networks are of the same\n\n\f2\norder.\nThe critical temperature Tc in a network is much\nsmaller than the degeneracy temperature for the 1D Bose\ngas of vacancies in a segment Td = h\u03042 n2 /m (the small\nparameter is (nl)\u22121 \u226a 1). In this respect the network\ndiffers from uniform 2D and 3D systems, where Tc \u2248 Td .\nOne can expect that the network may demonstrate quasi\nsuperfluid behavior in a wide range of temperatures between Tc and Td .\nTo be more specific we consider a 2D network. In a\nuniform 2D system the vortex-antivortex pairs unbind\nabove the BKT transition and vortices of opposite vorticities can move independently from each other. If a\ngiven vortex crosses the system in a direction perpendicular the flow, the superfluid phase difference along the\nflow changes on 2\u03c0. In a uniform system a motion of\na vortex across the flow is caused by the Magnus force\nand the viscous friction between the vortex and the normal component. The network is a multiple connected\nsystem, the vortices correspond to circular currents, and\nthey are pinned to given plaquettes. The vortex centers\ncannot move freely, but they can jump from one plaquette to another. This process becomes possible due to an\nemergence of phase slip (PS) centers at the segments.\nThe theory of dissipation of supercurrent in 1D channels based on the idea of emergence of PS centers was\nput forward by Langer and Ambegaokar24 . The main\nshortage of the theory24 is that it does not yield the\npre-exponential factor in the expression for the relaxation time. To obtain this factor one should consider\nthe dynamics of transition of the system over the potential barrier under appearance of a PS center. This problem was solved in Ref. 25 on the base of the diffusive\n(time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau) equation. We solve\nthe problem with the use of the wave (Gross-Pitaevskii)\nequation that describes an essentially different physical\nmechanism of relaxation of the supercurrent.\nIf the vortex is already present in a given plaquette the\nPS of the proper sign provides annihilation of that vortex\nand creation of a vortex of the same vorticity in the neighbor plaquette. A vortex may jump to any neighbor plaquette, but there is a preferable direction of such jumps\nin a system with a flow. Let us, for simplicity, consider\na regular quadratic network with a flow directed parallel\nto the segments (say x direction). If the vortex is centered in a given plaquette the superfluid velocities in the\nsegments that form this plaquette read as vA = vv + vs ,\nvC = vv \u2212vs , vB = vD = vv , where A and C stand for the\nsegments oriented along the x axis, while B and D - for\nthe segments oriented along the y axis (perpendicular to\nthe flow). Here vs is the flow velocity, and vv = \u03c0h\u0304/2ml\nis the contribution caused by the vortex. The frequency\nof PS in a segment is proportional to its length and it\nis a function of the superfluid velocity \u03bdi = lf (vi ). One\ncan see that \u03bdB = \u03bdD and in average the vortices do not\nmove in the x direction (the direction of the flow). The\nPS frequencies for two other segments differ from each\nother and one extra jump in the perpendicular to the\n\nflow direction gains with the frequency\n\u2206\u03bd = \u03bdA \u2212 \u03bdC = \u03b1lvs ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b1 = 2f \u2032 (v)|v=0 (here we imply the limit of small\nsuperfluid velocities). In the network of a rectangle shape\nof area S = Lx \u00d7 Ly a vortex crosses the system with\nthe frequency \u03bdcross = Nv \u2206\u03bdl/Ly , where Nv = nv S is\nthe total number of unbound vortices (nv is the vortex\ndensity). Each cross lowers the phase gradient on 2\u03c0/Lx\nthat changes the flow velocity on \u2206vs = \u22122\u03c0h\u0304/mLx. The\nequation for vs , written in the differential form, reads as\n2\u03c0h\u0304\u03b1nv l2\ndvs\n= \u03bdcross \u2206vs = \u2212\nvs .\ndt\nm\n\n(2)\n\nThe solution of Eq. (2) is vs = vs0 e\u2212t/\u03c4 , where \u03c4 =\nm/2\u03c0h\u0304\u03b1nv l2 is the decay time. To compute \u03b1 one\nshould specify the mechanism of PS. We will describe\nthe gas of zero-point vacancies in the dislocation core as a\nweakly non-ideal 1D Bose gas with a complex condensate\nwave function (order parameter) \u03a8(x, t) that satisfies the\nGross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation. The 1D GP equation\nwith a repulsive point interaction has an exact solution\nthat corresponds to a dark soliton. The dark soliton is a\nrarefaction that moves with a constant velocity u.\nThe dark soliton is described by the function26\n\"r\n!\n#\nr\n\u221a\nu2\nu2 x \u2212 ut\nu\n1 \u2212 2 tanh\n1\u2212 2\n+i\n.\n\u03a8(x, t) = \u00f1\nc\nc\n\u03be\nc\np (3)\nHere \u03be = h\u0304/mc is the coherence length, c = \u03b3n/m\nis the sound p\nvelocity, \u03b3 is the interaction constant, \u00f1 =\nn(1 \u2212 2(\u03be/l) 1 \u2212 u2 /c2 )\u22121 is the renormalized density\n(renormalization is the consequence of the conservation\nof the total number of zero-point vacancies).

To determine C\none can take into account that the soliton momentum\nis the difference of the momentum of the system with\nand without the soliton. The soliton emerges with the\nvelocity u = +c \u2212 0 or u = \u2212c + 0 and at such u its\nmomentum should be equal to zero. One can see that\ntwo conditions pu=\u00b1c = 0 yield two different integration\nconstants C\u00b1 = \u00b1h\u0304n\u03c0. Therefore, one should consider\n\n\f3\ntwo species of the solitons (the \"+\" and \"-\" ones) with\nthe momenta p\u00b1 defined by Eq. (5) with C = C\u00b1 .\nIt is important to emphasize that these two species\ncorrespond two physically distinct solitons. According to\nEq. (3) the phase at the\n\u221a soliton has the additional shift\n\u2206\u03c6(u) = \u22122 cot\u22121 (u/ c2 \u2212 u2 ). In any multiple connected system the phase satisfies the Onsager-Feynman\nquantization condition, and the appearance of a soliton\nshould be accompanied by a change in the net velocity:\nv = v0 + \u2206v\u00b1 (u). The function \u2206\u03c6(u) is discontinuous at u = 0 with the jump equal 2\u03c0. The functions\n\u2206v\u00b1 (u) should be continuous because small variation in\nu cannot result in a finite change in the net velocity.\nSince \u2206v+ (+c) = 0 and \u2206v\u2212 (\u2212c) = 0, the function\n\u2206v+ (u) 6= \u2206v\u2212 (u). For instance, for a 1D ring with\nthe perimeter l we find \u2206v\u00b1 = h\u0304(\u00b1\u03c0 \u2212 2 arcsin(u/c))/ml\n(we take into account that \u2206\u03c6 + ml\u2206v\u00b1 /h\u0304 = 0 mod 2\u03c0).\nThus, solitons of distinct species differ from each other\nby the change in the net velocity they induce.\nThe soliton may change its velocity due to the interaction with phonons and impurities. Since the soliton\nchanges the net velocity in a continuous way, it is more\nconsistent to consider PS as an entire process of creation\nof the soliton at u = +c and its annihilation at u = \u2212c,\nor vise versa. The first possibility corresponds to the \"+\"\nsolitons, and the second one - to the \"-\" ones.\nTo obtain the frequency of PS we consider solitons as\nclassical particles whose distribution functions f\u00b1 (p, t)\nsatisfy the Fokker-Planck equation\n\u2202f\u00b1\n\u2202s\u00b1\n=\u2212\n,\ndt\n\u2202p\n\n\u2202\nf\u00b1 .\n\u2202p\n\ns\u00b1 =\n\n\u00b12\u03c0h\u0304n\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n(6)\n\n(7)\n\nThe coefficients A\u00b1 and B\u00b1 satisfy the relation A\u00b1 f0,\u00b1 \u2212\nB\u00b1 \u2202f0,\u00b1 /\u2202p = 0, where f0,\u00b1 = exp(\u2212E\u00b1 /T ) is the equilibrium distribution function, and E\u00b1 = E0 +p\u00b1 v are the\nsoliton energies at nonzero net velocity. Here we consider\nthe case of slow relaxation. In this case one can neglect\nthe explicit time dependence of f\u00b1 and consider the fluxes\ns\u00b1 as constant quantities. Using the relation between the\ncoefficient A and B we rewrite Eq.

The solitons with p\u00b1 \u2192 \u00b12\u03c0h\u0304n emerge\nonly due to nonzero s\u00b1 . To attain such a momentum\nthe soliton should overcome the energy barrier \u2206E =\n4h\u0304nc/3. Therefore the fluxes are small and the distribution functions f\u00b1 at p = \u00b12\u03c0h\u0304n are much less than the\nequilibrium ones.

Using the exact form of f0 one finds that B\u00b1 = \u2212A\u00b1 T /(u +\nv). The coefficient A = dp/dt is just the viscous friction\nforce acting on solitons. At small velocities this force is\nproportional to the velocity of the soliton motion relative the normal component A = \u2212\u03b7(u + v), that yields\nB = \u03b7T , where \u03b7 is the friction coefficient (under assumption that \u03b7 is the same for \"+\" and \"-\" solitons, the\ncoefficients A\u00b1 = A and B\u00b1 = B are the same as well).\nThe soliton distribution functions\nare normalized by\nR\nthe condition nsol = (1/2\u03c0h\u0304) f dp, where nsol is the\nsoliton density. The quantities s\u00b1 are the fluxes in the\ndirection of larger momenta p (negative sign of s\u2212 means\nthat actual direction of the flux is the opposite one).

According to (12) the crossover temperature is T0p= 4h\u0304nc/3. For weakly non-ideal Bose\ngas T0 /Td \u223c \u03b3n/Td \u226a 1 and T0 /Tc \u223c l/\u03be \u226b 1, so\nTc \u226a T0 \u226a Td .\nTo evaluate the parameter \u03c40 we consider the friction connected with the interaction of the solitons with\nphonons. The dark soliton is the exact solution of the\n1D GP equation and it does not interact with phonons\nin 1D. But the dislocation core is not a strict 1D system. It is a quasi-1D system with a small, but finite\ncross-section. Such a system is described by an effective 1D GP equation with an additional higher order in\n\u03a8 interaction term27 : ih\u0304\u2202\u03a8/\u2202t = \u2212(h\u03042 /2m)\u2202 2 \u03a8/\u2202x2 +\n\u03b3|\u03a8|2 \u03a8 \u2212 \u03b31 |\u03a8|4 \u03a8. Due to such a term the reflection coefficient R \u223c (\u03b31 n/\u03b3)2 for the phonons that scatter on\nsoliton is nonzero27 .\nThe parameter \u03b31 n is evaluated as \u03b31 n \u223c \u03b3(r\u22a5 /\u03be)2 ,\nwhere r\u22a5 is the radius the supefluid channel. As was\nshown in Ref. 27, at small u (and v = 0) the time derivative of the soliton momentum is given by the expression\n\u1e57 = \u2212\u03b7u = \u2212C(mRT /h\u0304)u, where the numerical factor\n\n\f4\nC \u223c 1. It yields \u03c40 \u223c (h\u0304/T )(\u03be/r\u22a5 )4 . The scale of \u03c40 is\ndetermined by the quantity h\u0304/T that is of order of 10\u221210\nc\u22121 for T = 0.1 K.\nIt is necessary to note one important point. One could\nthink that since the GP equation we use is invariant with\nrespect to translations it is impossible to describe the relaxation of superflow in the GP approach. But our approach is basically the same as commonly used for the\ncomputation of forces that act on a vortex in a 3D superfluid caused by its interaction with phonons and rotons (see, for instance Ref. 28). In the latter case the\nGP approach is applied for the computation of amplitudes of scattering of phonons on vortices and for finding\nthe momentum flux over the cylindrical surface around\nthe vortex line. In such a way one can obtain the rate\nof transfer of the momentum from a vortex to phonons,\ni.e.., to the normal component, which is assumed to be in\nequilibrium with the environment (walls, substrate, etc.)\nThe specific of the 1D system is that for the GP equation with only cubic interaction term the phonons do\nnot interact with solitons and there is no transfer of the\nmomentum from solitons to the normal component. The\nfifth-order term switches on that interaction, and the momentum transfers from solitons to 1D phonons of the network. 1D phonons interact with bulk phonons and due\nto such an interaction the normal component in the network remains in equilibrium with the crystal (since the\nrelaxation time in the phonon subsystem is much smaller\nthan \u03c4 given by Eq. (12)). Eventually, the momentum\nobtained from solitons is transferred to the crystal. Here\nwe do not describe explicitly the mechanism of such a\ntransfer, but just imply that the normal component is in\n\n1\n\n2\n3\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n7\n8\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\nA. F.

We note that at very\nsmall temperatures quantum jumps between states with\ndifferent vortex configurations may become important\n(for 1D rings the quantum jumps were studied in Refs.\n29,30). We estimate the quantum correction to the \u03c4\nis \u03c40 \u221d en\u03be and this correction becomes important at\nT <\n\u223c \u03b3n = T0 /n\u03be \u226a T0 . The quantum correction results only in a modification of the law of increase in the\nrelaxation time under lowering of temperature and its accounting should not change the main conclusion on the\nemergence of the quasi superfluid state in the network\nwell above the critical temperature.\nIn this Rapid Communication we have considered quasi\nsuperfluidity in a 2D network. The situation in a 3D network should be qualitatively the same. In the latter case\nsuperflow may decay due to expansion or shrinking of\nvortex rings. The mechanism of expansion(shrinking) of\nvortex rings in a 3D network is basically the same as vortex motion in a 2D network: both of them are connected\nwith the phase slips in segments of the network.\nIn conclusion, we note that the results obtained can be\nalso applied to multiple connected Bose-Einstein condensates of rarefied alkali gases in optical lattices31 , where\nthe quasi superfluid state can be observed directly.\nWe are grateful N.V.Prokof'ev, B.V.Svistunov and\nG.V.Shlyapnikov for the discussion.
