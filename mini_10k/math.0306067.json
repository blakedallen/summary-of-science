This is a detailed survey on the QWEP conjecture and Connes'\nembedding problem. Most of contents are taken from Kirchberg's paper [Invent.\nMath. 112 (1993)].\n\n1. Introduction\nFollowing Kirchberg [Ki1], we prove that several important conjectures arising\nin several branches of operator algebras are in fact equivalent.\nTheorem 1.1. The following conjectures are equivalent.\n(i) We have C \u2217 F\u221e \u2297max C \u2217 F\u221e = C \u2217 F\u221e \u2297min C \u2217 F\u221e .\n(ii) The predual of any (separable) von Neumann algebra is finitely representable\nin the trace class S1 .\n(iii) Any separable II1 -factor is a subfactor of the ultrapower R\u03c9 of the hyperfinite\nII1 -factor R.\nLet A and B be C \u2217 -algebras and consider the problem to introduce a norm on\ntheir algebraic tensor product A \u2297 B. Although there are presumably many C \u2217 norms on the \u2217-algebra A \u2297 B, there are two distinguished norms; the minimal\none and the maximal one. (A rather surprising theorem of Takesaki [Ta1] states\nthat the minimal tensor norm is indeed the smallest C \u2217 -norm on A \u2297 B.) These\nC \u2217 -norms have nice functorial properties; both tensor norms tensorize completely\npositive maps and persist in passing to the second dual, and moreover, the minimal\ntensor norm is injective while the maximal tensor norm is projective. Thus, it is\nnatural to ask whether or not the minimal (resp. maximal) tensor norm is the\nunique C \u2217 -norm with these functoriality. Since injective (resp. projective) C \u2217 norm comes from a fixed C \u2217 -norm on B(l2 ) \u2297 B(l2 ) (resp. C \u2217 F\u221e \u2297 C \u2217 F\u221e ), this\nproblem is equivalent to asking whether there is only one C \u2217 -norm on B(l2 )\u2297B(l2 )\n(resp. C \u2217 F\u221e \u2297 C \u2217 F\u221e ). Probably led by this consideration (cf. [Ki4]), Kirchberg\nconjectured that the answer would be yes for both cases. However, the problem\nDate: June 1, 2003.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 46L05, 46L06, 46L10.\nKey words and phrases. QWEP conjecture, Connes' embedding problem.\nThe author was supported by the JSPS Postdoctoral Fellowships for Research Abroad.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nNARUTAKA OZAWA\n\non B(l2 ) \u2297 B(l2 ) was solved negatively by Junge and Pisier [JP]. The problem on\nC \u2217 F\u221e \u2297 C \u2217 F\u221e remains outstanding.\nThe conjecture (ii) seems old (cf. [HP]). Since several analytical structures of\nBanach spaces depend only on those of finite dimensional subspaces, it is desirable\nto know whether any noncommutative L1 -spaces are finitely representable in the\ntrace class S1 . Many problems arising in operator spaces and noncommutative\nLp spaces are also connected to finite representability (as an operator space, e.g.\n[Ju][EJR][JR]).\nThe problem (iii) was casually raised by Connes [Co] and is drawing increased\nattention in recent years in connection with free probability theory. Haagerup\n[Ha3] showed a remarkable theorem that invariant subspaces exist for a large class\nof operators in II1 -factors that are embeddable in R\u03c9 . Thus, a positive answer\nwould nicely complement Haagerup's theorem. The problem (iii) is equivalent to\nthat microstates always exist. Microstates are used to define free entropy \u03c7 introduced by Voiculescu [Vo1]. Besides its own interest, free entropy has a number of\nimportant applications to theory of von Neumann algebras. Voiculescu [Vo2] later\nintroduced another free entropy \u03c7\u2217 and asked the \"unification problem\" whether\nthey actually coincide. A negative answer to (iii) would imply this is not the case.\nSee Voiculescu's survey [Vo3] for details.\nThe problem (iii) may well be connected to geometric group theory in deep and\nimportant ways. A positive answer would imply that all countable discrete groups\nare hyperlinear and hence would refute the famous \"theorem\" of Gromov claiming\nthat a proposition which holds for all countable discrete groups is either trivial\nor false. Here, we say a group is hyperlinear if it is embeddable into the unitary\ngroup U(R\u03c9 ) of R\u03c9 . The class of hyperlinear groups is closed under several natural operations and contains all amenable groups and all residually finite groups.\nSince many exotic groups (or \"monsters\"), such as periodic simple groups with\nKazhdan's property (T) and non-uniformly embeddable groups of Gromov [Gr1]\n[Gr2], are arising as limits of hyperbolic groups, it is particularly interesting to\nknow whether all hyperbolic groups are hyperlinear. In particular, if such simple property (T) groups or non-uniformly embeddable groups are not hyperlinear,\nthen there would exist non-hyperlinear hyperbolic groups. Whether all hyperbolic groups are residually finite (and hence hyperlinear) is one of the major open\nproblem in geometric group theory.\nIt is not completely understood for which C \u2217 -algebra A the semigroup Ext(A)\nis actually a group. Kirchberg [Ki1] showed the Ext semigroup of the cone (or the\nsuspension) over A is a group if and only if A has the LLP (local lifting property).\nSince a positive answer would imply that exact and non-nuclear C \u2217 -algebras cannot\nhave the LLP, it would follow Ext(cone(A)) (and Ext(S(A))) never a group when\nA is exact and non-nuclear.\n\n\fABOUT THE QWEP CONJECTURE\n\n3\n\nProof of Theorem 1.1. The equivalence (i)\u21d4(ii) follows from Propositions 3.19, 4.1\nand Corollary 5.3. The implication (ii)\u21d2(iii) follows from Corollary 6.2. Now, we\nassume (iii) and prove (i). The assumption (iii) is equivalent to that all extremal\ntraces (and a fortiori all traces) of C \u2217 F\u221e satisfy the conditions in Theorem 6.1.\nThis implies that all separable von Neumann algebras of type II1 are QWEP (cf.\nCorollary 6.2). We complete the proof by Proposition 4.1 and the well-known\nTakesaki's theorem [Ta2] that any separable von Neumann algebra is \u2217-isomorphic\nto a cp complemented von Neumann subalgebra in a separable semifinite von\nNeumann algebra.\n\u0003\nAcknowledgment. The author would like to thank Professors Nate Brown and\nGilles Pisier for valuable comments. This survey was written while the author was\nvisiting the University of California at Berkeley under the support of the Japanese\nSociety for the Promotion of Science Postdoctoral Fellowships for Research Abroad.\nNotations. Unless otherwise stated, all C \u2217 -algebras in this paper are assumed\nunital (except for ideals) and maps between them are assumed linear. We will\nwrite A, B, C, . . . for unital C \u2217 -algebras, J, . . . for ideals (which always mean closed\ntwo-sided ideals) in C \u2217 -algebras, M, N, . . . for von Neumann algebras, R for the\nhyperfinite II1 -factor, F (resp. F\u221e ) for a free group (resp. on countably many\ngenerators), B(H) (resp. K(H)) for the C \u2217 -algebra of all bounded linear (resp.\ncompact) operators on a Hilbert space H, Mn for the n by n full matrix algebra.\n2. Preliminary Background\nIn this section, we collect some basic results on positive maps. We will omit\nproofs if they are found in standard references.\nFor C \u2217 -algebras A and B, we denote by A \u2297 B (resp. A \u2297min B, A \u2297max B) the\nalgebraic (resp. minimal, maximal) tensor product. For von Neumann algebras M\n \u0304 the von Neumann tensor product. For the definitions\nand N, we denote by M \u2297N\nand basic properties of these tensor product, we refer the reader to Chapter IV in\nTakesaki's book [Ta1] and Appendix (T) in Wegge-Olsen's book [We].\nA general reference for the positive maps is Sections 2 and 3 in Paulsen's book\n[Pa1]. For simplicity, we only deal with unital C \u2217 -algebras and unital maps, although this restriction is inessential.\nLemma 2.1. A unital map between unital C \u2217 -algebras is positive if and only if\nit is contractive. A positive map from a commutative C \u2217 -algebra into a (possibly\nnoncommutative) C \u2217 -algebra is automatically cp.\nFor the proof, see Corollary 2.9, Proposition 3.6 and Theorem 3.11 in [Pa1]. The\nfollowing two theorems are fundamental. The first one is due to Arveson [Ar1] for\ncp maps and Wittstock for cb maps. Recall that a unital self-adjoint subspace\nof a C \u2217 -algebra is called an operator system. This theorem means that B(H) is\n\n\f4\n\nNARUTAKA OZAWA\n\ninjective in the category of operator systems with ucp maps (resp. operator spaces\nwith complete contractions).\nTheorem 2.2. Let X \u2282 B be an operator space. Then any cb map \u03c6 : X \u2192 B(H)\nextends to a cb map \u03c6\u0303 : B \u2192 B(H) with k\u03c6\u0303kcb = k\u03c6kcb . In particular, a ucp map\nfrom an operator system into B(H) extends to a ucp map.\nThe second one is the Stinespring dilation theorem.\nTheorem 2.3. Let \u03c6 : A \u2192 B(H) be a ucp map. Then, there is a representation\nb and an isometry V : H \u2192 H\nb such that \u03c0(A)V H is dense in H\nb and\n\u03c0 : A \u2192 B(H)\n\u2217\nb\nthat \u03c6(a) = V \u03c0(a)V for a \u2208 A. Moreover, the triple (\u03c0, H, V ) is unique up to\nunitary equivalence.\nCorollary 2.4. If \u03c6 : A \u2192 B is a ucp map, then \u03c6 \u2297 idC : A \u2297 C \u2192 B \u2297 C is\ncontinuous w.r.t. the minimal (resp. maximal) tensor norms.\n\nProof. We only prove this corollary for the maximal tensor product. Take a faithful\nb V ) be the Stinespring triplet for\nrepresentation B \u2297max C \u2282 B(H) and let (\u03c0, H,\n\u03c6 : A \u2192 B(H). We claim that for x \u2208 C, the operator \u03c1(x) defined by\nX\nX\nb\n\u03c1(x) : \u03c0(A)V H \u220b\n\u03c0(aj )V \u03bej 7\u2212\u2192\n\u03c0(aj )V x\u03bej \u2208 H\nj\n\nj\n\nis well-defined and k\u03c1(x)k \u2264 kxk. Indeed, putting \u03be = [\u03be1 , . . . , \u03ben ]T \u2208 ln2 \u2297 H, we\nhave\nX\nX\nk\n\u03c0(aj )V x\u03bej k2 =\n(\u03c6(a\u2217i aj )x\u03bej , x\u03bei )\nj\n\ni,j\n\n= ((1 \u2297 x)\u2217 [\u03c6(a\u2217i aj )](1 \u2297 x)\u03be, \u03be)\nX\n\u2264 kxk2 ([\u03c6(a\u2217i aj )]\u03be, \u03be) = kxk2 k\n\u03c0(aj )V \u03bej k2 ,\nj\n\n[\u03c6(a\u2217i aj )]i,j\n\nwhere we used the fact that\n\u2208 Mn (B) is positive and commutes with\n\u2032\nb\n1 \u2297 x for x \u2208 C \u2282 B . Since \u03c0(A)V H \u2282 H is dense, \u03c1 gives rise to a representation\nb whose range commutes with \u03c0(A). Hence, \u03c0 \u00d7 \u03c1 is a representation of\nof C on H\nA \u2297max C such that (\u03c6 \u2297 idC )(a \u2297 x) = V \u2217 (\u03c0 \u00d7 \u03c1)(a \u2297 x)V for a \u2208 A and x \u2208 C.\nThis completes the proof. The above construction is taken from [Ar1].\n\u0003\nThe Jordan product \u25e6 on a C \u2217 -algebra A is defined as a \u25e6 b = (ab + ba)/2 for a\nand b in A. This equips A with a commutative non-associative \u2217-algebra structure.\nA self-adjoint subspace in a C \u2217 -algebra which is closed under the Jordan product\nwill be simply called a Jordan algebra. A positive linear map between Jordan\nalgebras is called a Jordan morphism if it preserves the Jordan product. Jordan\nmorphisms are necessarily contractive (cf. Lemma 2.1).\nThe following Schwarz type inequalities are due to Kadison [Ka] for positive\nmaps and Choi [Ch1] for cp maps.\n\n\fABOUT THE QWEP CONJECTURE\n\n5\n\nCorollary 2.5. Let \u03c6 : A \u2192 B(H) be a ucp (resp. unital positive) map. Then, we\nhave \u03c6(a\u2217 a) \u2265 \u03c6(a)\u2217 \u03c6(a) (resp. \u03c6(a\u2217 \u25e6 a) \u2265 \u03c6(a)\u2217 \u25e6 \u03c6(a)) for every a \u2208 A.\nb V ) be the Stinespring triplet. Then,\nProof. First, let \u03c6 be a ucp map and (\u03c0, H,\nwe have\n\u03c6(a\u2217 a) \u2212 \u03c6(a)\u2217 \u03c6(a) = V \u2217 \u03c0(a)\u2217 (1 \u2212 V V \u2217 )\u03c0(a)V \u2265 0\nfor every a \u2208 A. This proves the case where \u03c6 is cp.\nNow, let \u03c6 be a unital positive map. It follows from the cp case that \u03c6(b2 ) \u2265\n\u03c6(b)2 for every self-adjoint element b in A since the restriction of \u03c6 to the commutative C \u2217 -subalgebra generated by b is automatically cp. Hence, denoting by\nRe a = (a\u2217 + a)/2 and Im a = i(a\u2217 \u2212 a)/2, we have\n\u03c6(a\u2217 \u25e6 a) = \u03c6((Re a)2 + (Im a)2 ) \u2265 \u03c6(Re a)2 + \u03c6(Im a)2 = \u03c6(a)\u2217 \u25e6 \u03c6(a)\nfor every a \u2208 A.\n\n\u0003\n\nCorollary 2.6. Let \u03c6 : A \u2192 B(H) be a ucp (resp. unital positive) map. For a \u2208 A,\nwe have\n\u03c6(a\u2217 a) = \u03c6(a)\u2217 \u03c6(a) \u21d2 \u03c6(xa) = \u03c6(x)\u03c6(a) for all x \u2208 A\n\u03c6(aa\u2217 ) = \u03c6(a)\u03c6(a)\u2217 \u21d2 \u03c6(ax) = \u03c6(a)\u03c6(x) for all x \u2208 A\n(resp. \u03c6(a\u2217 \u25e6 a) = \u03c6(a)\u2217 \u25e6 \u03c6(a) \u21d2 \u03c6(x \u25e6 a) = \u03c6(x) \u25e6 \u03c6(a) for all x \u2208 A).\nMoreover, the subspace C = {a \u2208 A : \u03c6(a\u2217 a) = \u03c6(a)\u2217 \u03c6(a), \u03c6(aa\u2217 ) = \u03c6(a)\u03c6(a)\u2217 }\n(resp. C = {a \u2208 A : \u03c6(a\u2217 \u25e6 a) = \u03c6(a)\u2217 \u25e6 \u03c6(a)}) is a C \u2217 -subalgebra (resp. a Jordan\nsubalgebra) of A.\nProof. We denote by * the usual product (resp. the Jordan product) throughout\nthis proof. Let a \u2208 A be so that \u03c6(a\u2217 * a) = \u03c6(a)\u2217 * \u03c6(a) and x \u2208 A be arbitrary.\nBy Corollary 2.5, we have for any t \u2208 R,\n0 \u2264 \u03c6((ta + x)\u2217 * (ta + x)) \u2212 \u03c6(ta + x)\u2217 * \u03c6(ta + x)\n\n\u0001\n= t \u03c6(a\u2217 * x + x\u2217 * a) \u2212 \u03c6(a)\u2217 * \u03c6(x) \u2212 \u03c6(x)\u2217 * \u03c6(a) + \u03c6(x\u2217 * x) \u2212 \u03c6(x)\u2217 * \u03c6(x).\n\nSince t \u2208 R is arbitrary, it follows that \u03c6(a\u2217 * x + x\u2217 * a) = \u03c6(a)\u2217 * \u03c6(x) + \u03c6(x)\u2217 * \u03c6(a).\nReplacing x with ix, we obtain \u03c6(a\u2217 * x \u2212 x\u2217 * a) = \u03c6(a)\u2217 * \u03c6(x) \u2212 \u03c6(x)\u2217 * \u03c6(a).\nCombining them, we obtain \u03c6(x\u2217 * a) = \u03c6(x)\u2217 * \u03c6(a) for all x \u2208 A. This proves the\nfirst half.\nWe only prove that C is a Jordan subalgebra for unital positive \u03c6. It is clear\nthat C is a self-adjoint subspace of A. Hence, it is sufficient to show that Csa =\n{a \u2208 C : a = a\u2217 } is closed under the Jordan product. Since the usual product\nand the Jordan product coincide on a commutative subalgebra, we have a2 \u2208 Csa\nprovided that a \u2208 Csa . Now, the claim that a \u25e6 b \u2208 Csa for any a, b \u2208 Csa follows\nfrom the first half of this corollary and the equation\n1\n1\n(a \u25e6 b)2 = a \u25e6 (b \u25e6 (a \u25e6 b)) + (a2 \u25e6 b) \u25e6 b \u2212 a2 \u25e6 b2 .\n2\n2\n\n\f6\n\nNARUTAKA OZAWA\n\nThis completes the proof.\n\n\u0003\n\nDefinition 2.7. We say the subalgebra C in Corollary 2.6 is the multiplicative\ndomain for \u03c6.\nBy Corollary 2.5, a \u2208 A is in the multiplicative domain for \u03c6 provided that that\nkak = 1 and \u03c6(a) is a unitary. Therefore, if \u03c6 : A \u2192 B is a ucp (resp. unital\npositive) map which maps the closed unit ball of A onto the closed unit ball of B,\nthen \u03c6 is surjective on the multiplicative domain for \u03c6.\nThe following important corollary will be used frequently without mention.\nCorollary 2.8. Let A \u2282 B and let \u03c6 : B \u2192 B(H) be a ucp map such that the\nrestriction of \u03c6 to A is a \u2217-homomorphism \u03c0, then \u03c6 is an A-bimodule map, i.e.,\n\u03c6(axb) = \u03c0(a)\u03c6(x)\u03c0(b) for a, b \u2208 A and x \u2208 B.\nA map \u03c6 on B is called a projection if \u03c62 = \u03c6. The following theorem is due\nto Tomiyama [To]. A simple proof is found in Section 9 in Str\u0103til\u0103's book [St] and\nChapter IX in Takesaki's book [Ta2].\nTheorem 2.9. For A \u2282 B and a projection \u03c6 from B onto A, the following are\nequivalent.\n(i) The map \u03c6 is a conditional expectation, i.e., the map \u03c6 is an A-bimodule\nmap; \u03c6(axb) = a\u03c6(x)b for a, b \u2208 A and x \u2208 B.\n(ii) The map \u03c6 is cp.\n(iii) The map \u03c6 is contractive.\nWe need the structure theorem for Jordan morphisms due to St\u00f8rmer [HS].\nTheorem 2.10. Let A be a C \u2217 -algebra and \u03b8 : A \u2192 B(H) be a Jordan morphism.\nThen, there is a central projection p in the von Neumann algebra M = \u03b8(A)\u2032\u2032\ngenerated by \u03b8(A) such that the map A \u220b a 7\u2192 \u03b8(a)p \u2208 Mp (resp. A \u220b a 7\u2192\n\u03b8(a)(1 \u2212 p) \u2208 M(1 \u2212 p)) is a \u2217-homomorphism (resp. \u2217-antihomomorphism).\nWe review some operator space theory. We refer the reader to the books of Effros\nand Ruan [ER2] and of Pisier [Pi2]. Many important results in operator space\ntheory are related to the dual operator space structure introduced by BlecherPaulsen and Effros-Ruan [Bl], [BP], [ER1].\nLet X \u2282 B(H) be an operator space and let X \u2217 be its dual Banach space. For\nx = [xij ]i,j \u2208 Mn (X), we define \u03b8x : X \u2217 \u220b f 7\u2212\u2192 [f (xij )]i,j \u2208 Mn . Let \u03a9 be the\nunion of the closed unit balls of Mn (X) (n = 1, 2, . . .). We introduce an operator\nspace structure on X \u2217 by the isometric inclusion\nY\n\u0398 : X \u2217 \u220b f 7\u2212\u2192 (\u03b8x (f ))x\u2208\u03a9 \u2208\nMn(x) .\nx\u2208\u03a9\n\nUnless otherwise stated, we always assume that the dual space X \u2217 is equipped\nwith this operator space structure. (We note that Mn (X \u2217\u2217 ) = Mn (X)\u2217\u2217 always\n\n\fABOUT THE QWEP CONJECTURE\n\n7\n\nholds isometrically, but Mn (X \u2217 ) = Mn (X)\u2217 is not isometric.) It is not hard to see\nX \u2217 \u2297min Mn = Mn (X \u2217 ) = CB(X, Mn ) isometrically. It follows that for operator\nspaces X and Y , there is a canonical isometric inclusion defined by\nX\nX\nfk ( * )yk \u2208 CB(X, Y ).\nfk \u2297 yk 7\u2212\u2192\nX \u2217 \u2297min Y \u220b\nk\n\nk\n\nThe predual M\u2217 of a von Neumann algebra M is equipped with the operator space\nstructure induced from that of M \u2217 . It is proved in [Bl] that M = (M\u2217 )\u2217 completely\nisometrically as one should expect.\n3. WEP and LLP\n\nDefinition 3.1. We say a C \u2217 -subalgebra A in B is cp complemented (resp. weakly\ncp complemented) in B if there is a a ucp map \u03c6 : B \u2192 A (resp. \u03c6 : B \u2192 A\u2217\u2217 )\nsuch that \u03c6|A = idA .\nWe say a C \u2217 -algebra B has the WEP (weak expectation property), if it is weakly\ncp complemented in B(H) for a faithful representation B \u2282 B(H).\nSince B(H) is injective, the definition of the WEP does not depend on choice of\nfaithful representation of B. We say a C \u2217 -algebra is QWEP if it is a quotient of a\nC \u2217 -algebra with the WEP. The QWEP conjecture states that all C \u2217 -algebras are\nQWEP.\nIf M \u2282 N are von Neumann algebras with a faithful normal trace \u03c4 on N,\nthen there is a unique trace preserving conditional expectation \u03a6 from N onto M\ndefined by the relation \u03c4 (a\u03a6(x)) = \u03c4 (ax) for a \u2208 M and x \u2208 M. In particular, M\nis cp complemented in N. Indeed, this follows from the fact that linear functionals\non M of the form \u03c4 (a * ) with a \u2208 M are dense in M\u2217 . Let \u2206 be a subgroup of \u0393.\nThen, the C \u2217 -subalgebra in the full C \u2217 -algebra C \u2217 \u0393 generated by \u2206 is naturally\n\u2217-isomorphic to C \u2217 \u2206. Indeed, this follows from existence of induction. Moreover,\nC \u2217 \u2206 is cp complemented in C \u2217 \u0393 by the conditional expectation \u03c6 defined by\n\u03c6(s) = 0 for s \u2208 \u0393 \\ \u2206.\nLemma 3.2. For C \u2217 -algebras A \u2282 B, the following are equivalent.\n(i) The C \u2217 -algebra A is weakly cp complemented in B.\n(ii) The second dual A\u2217\u2217 is cp complemented in B \u2217\u2217 .\n(iii) For any finite dimensional subspace E \u2282 B and any \u03b5 > 0, there exists a map\n\u03c6 : E \u2192 A such that k\u03c6k \u2264 1 + \u03b5 and \u03c6|E\u2229A = idE\u2229A .\nIn particular, if A is weakly cp complemented in B and B has the WEP,\nthen so\nQ\n\u2217\ndoes A. If (Ai )i\u2208I is a family of C -algebras with the WEP, then\nAi has the\nWEP.\nProof. The equivalence (i)\u21d4(ii) is a consequence of the fact that any bounded\nlinear map \u03c6 from a Banach space X into a dual Banach space Y = (Y\u2217 )\u2217 uniquely\nextends to a weak\u2217 -continuous map \u03c6\u0303 from X \u2217\u2217 into Y . The implication (i)\u21d2(iii)\n\n\f8\n\nNARUTAKA OZAWA\n\nfollows from the principle of local reflexivity for Banach spaces. To prove (iii)\u21d2(ii),\nlet I be the set of pairs (E, \u03b5), where E \u2282 B is finite dimensional and \u03b5 > 0. The\nset I is directed by the order relation (E1 , \u03b51) \u2264 (E2 , \u03b52 ) if and only if E1 \u2282 E2\nand \u03b51 \u2265 \u03b52 . By the condition (iii), for each i = (E, \u03b5) \u2208 I, there exists a map\n\u03c6i : B \u2192 A\u2217\u2217 such that k\u03c6i|E k \u2264 1 + \u03b5 and \u03c6i |E\u2229A = idE\u2229A . Then, any cluster\npoint \u03c6 : B \u2192 A\u2217\u2217 of the net {\u03c6i }i\u2208I , in the point-weak\u2217 topology, satisfies that\nk\u03c6k \u2264 1 and \u03c6|A = idA . It follows from Theorem 2.9 that the weak\u2217 -continuous\nextension \u03c6\u0304 of \u03c6 on B \u2217\u2217 is a conditional expectation from B \u2217\u2217 onto A\u2217\u2217 .\nFinally, we observe that the condition (iii) is stable under direct product.\n\u0003\nThe notion of WEP was introduced by Lance [La1] where he showed the following\ntheorem, which in particular shows nuclear C \u2217 -algebras have the WEP.\nTheorem 3.3. Let A \u2282 B. Then, A is weakly cp complemented in B if and only\nif A \u2297max C \u2282 B \u2297max C isometrically for any C \u2217 -algebra C (resp. for C = C \u2217 F\u221e\nor C = Aop ).\nProof. We note that the canonical map A \u2297max C \u2282 A\u2217\u2217 \u2297max C is always isometric\nand the canonical map \u03b9\u2297idC : A\u2297max C \u2192 B \u2297max C is always contractive. Hence,\nthe \"only if \" part follows from Corollary 2.4. To prove \"if\" part, let A \u2282 B(H)\nbe the universal representation, i.e., A\u2032\u2032 = A\u2217\u2217 , and let C be a C \u2217 -algebra which\nhas a representation \u03c0 : C \u2192 B(H) with \u03c0(C)\u2032\u2032 = A\u2032 . By the assumption, the\nrepresentation A \u2297max C on B(H) extends to a ucp map \u03a6 : B \u2297max C \u2192 B(H).\nThen, the map \u03c6 : B \u220b b 7\u2192 \u03a6(b \u2297 1) \u2208 B(H) is a ucp extension of idA . Since \u03a6\nis a C-bimodule map (cf. Corollary 2.8), we have \u03c6(b)\u03c0(x) = \u03a6(b \u2297 x) = \u03c0(x)\u03c6(b)\nfor b \u2208 B and x \u2208 C, i.e., \u03c6(b) \u2208 \u03c0(C)\u2032 = A\u2217\u2217 . This completes the proof.\n\u0003\nThe following proposition reduces many problems to that for separable C \u2217 algebras.\nProposition 3.4. Let B be a (non-separable) C \u2217 -algebra and let X \u2282 B be a\nseparable subspace. Then, there is a separable C \u2217 -subalgbera A which contains X\nand is weakly cp complemented in B.\nProof. Let C = C \u2217 F\u221e and let (Bi )i\u2208I be the directed set of all separable C \u2217 subalgebras in B ordered by inclusions. We claim that kxkB\u2297max C = lim kxkBi \u2297max C\nfor every x \u2208 B \u2297 C. Note that the limit in R.H.S. always exists since the net is\ndecreasing and that the inequality \u2264 is clear. To prove the converse inequality,\nsuppose that kxkBi \u2297max C \u2265 1 for all i \u2208 I. It follows that for every i \u2208 I, there\nare commuting representations \u03c0i : Bi \u2192 B(Hi ) and \u03c1i : C \u2192 B(Hi ) such that\nk(\u03c0i * \u03c1i )(x)kB(Hi ) \u2265 1. Let \u03c9 be a nontrivial ultrafilter on the directed set I and let\nH\u03c9 be the ultraproduct Hilbert space of (Hi )i\u2208I . Then, the nets (\u03c0i )i\u2208I and (\u03c1i )i\u2208I\ngive rise to commuting representations \u03c0\u03c9 : B \u2192 B(H\u03c9 ) and \u03c1\u03c9 : C \u2192 B(H\u03c9 ).\nTherefore, we have kxkB\u2297max C \u2265 k(\u03c0\u03c9 * \u03c1\u03c9 )(x)kB(H\u03c9 ) \u2265 1, which proves the claim.\n\n\fABOUT THE QWEP CONJECTURE\n\n9\n\nLet A0 \u2282 B be a separable C \u2217 -subalgebra containing X. Using the first part\nof this proof recursively, we can find an increasing sequence (An )\u221e\nn=0 of separable\n\u2217\nC -subalgebras in B such that kxkB\u2297max CS= kxkAn \u2297max C for every n \u2208 N and\n\u2217\nx \u2208 An\u22121 \u2297 C. Let A be the closure of \u221e\nn=1 An . Then, A is a separable C subalgebra such that A \u2297max C \u2282 B \u2297max C isometrically. Hence, by Theorem 3.3,\nA is weakly cp complemented in B.\n\u0003\nDefinition 3.5. Let \u03c6 : A \u2192 B/J be a ucp map. We say \u03c6 is ucp liftable if there\nis a ucp lifting \u03c8 : A \u2192 B, i.e., there is a ucp map \u03c8 such that \u03c6 = \u03c0\u03c8 for the\nquotient \u03c0 from B onto B/J. We say \u03c6 is locally ucp liftable if for any finite\ndimensional operator system E in A, there is a ucp lifting \u03c8 : E \u2192 B.\nWe say A has the LP (lifting property) (resp. the LLP (local lifting property))\nif any ucp map from A into any quotient C \u2217 -algebra B/J is (resp. locally) ucp\nliftable.\nThe following Effros-Haagerup lifting theorem [EH] characterizes those ucp maps\nwhich are locally ucp liftable.\nTheorem 3.6. A ucp map \u03c6 : A \u2192 B/J is locally ucp liftable if and only if\n\u03c6 \u2297 id : A \u2297 B(l2 ) \u2192 (B \u2297min B(l2 ))/(J \u2297min B(l2 ))\nis continuous w.r.t. the minimal tensor norm on A \u2297 B(l2 ).\nExistence of completely contractive local lifting immediately follows from operator space duality explained in Section 2, but making the lifting completely positive\nrequires a technical lemma. See [EH] or [Wa] for the proof of the following lemma.\nLemma 3.7. Let \u03c6 : E \u2192 B/J be a ucp map from a finite dimensional operator\nsystem into a quotient C \u2217 -algebra. Suppose that for any \u03b5 > 0, there is a lifting\n\u03c8 : E \u2192 B with k\u03c8kcb \u2264 1 + \u03b5. Then, \u03c6 is ucp liftable.\nThe C \u2217 -algebra B(l2 ) is universal in the sense that it contains all separable C \u2217 algebras and is injective. The other universal thing is the full C \u2217 -algebra C \u2217 F\u221e of\nthe free group F\u221e on countably many generators since any separable C \u2217 -algebra\nis a quotient of it and it has the LP.\nTheorem 3.8. The full C \u2217 -algebra C \u2217 F of a countable free group F has the LP.\nProof. This proof is taken from [Ki2]. We first show that a \u2217-homomorphism\n\u03b8 : C \u2217 F \u2192 B/J is ucp liftable. To this end, let x1 , x2 , . . . \u2208 B be a contractive\nliftings of \u03b8(s1 ), \u03b8(s2 ), . . ., where s1 , s2 , . . . are the free generators of F.

It\nis not hard to see that the (1, 1)-corner of \u03c1 is a desired lifting of \u03b8.\n\n\f10\n\nNARUTAKA OZAWA\n\nNow, let \u03c6 : C \u2217 F \u2192 B/J be a ucp map. Since F is countable, we may assume\nB/J is separable. By the Kasparov-Stinespring dilation theorem [La2], there is a\n\u2217-homomorphism \u03b8 : C \u2217 F \u2192 M(K \u2297min B/J) such that \u03c6(a) = \u03b8(a)11 for a \u2208 C \u2217 F,\nwhere x11 is the (1, 1)-entry of x \u2208 M(K \u2297min B/J). By the noncommutative\nTietze extension theorem, the surjective \u2217-homomorphism \u03c0 from K \u2297min B onto\nK \u2297min B/J extends to a surjective \u2217-homomorphism \u03c0\u0303 between their multiplier\nalgebras. Hence, by the first part of this proof, there is a ucp map \u03c1 : C \u2217 F \u2192\nM(K \u2297min B) such that \u03b8 = \u03c0\u0303\u03c1. The ucp map \u03c8 : C \u2217 F \u220b a 7\u2192 \u03c1(a)11 \u2208 B is a\ndesired lifting of \u03c6.\n\u0003\nThe above proof seems unreasonably involved. Hence it would be interesting to\nfind another proof. (The LLP, rather than the LP, is sufficient in most of places\nand an independent proof of the LLP for C \u2217 F\u221e will be given in Theorem 3.14.)\nWe note that a map \u03c6 from a discrete group \u0393 into a C \u2217 -algebra A extends to a\nucp map on the full C \u2217 -algbera C \u2217 \u0393 if and only if it is unital and positive definite,\ni.e., [\u03c6(s\u22121\ni sj )]i,j is positive in Mn (A) for any n and any s1 , . . . , sn \u2208 \u0393.\nSince countable noncommutative free groups are isomorphic to subgroups of\neach other, their distinction in our story is very minor. The full C \u2217 -algebras of free\ngroups (on uncountable generators) do have the LLP. It seems they do not have the\nLP, but it is not known (even for the free group of continuous cardinality). There\nis a (non-separable) C \u2217 -algebra which has the LLP but not the LP. Indeed, the\ncommutative C \u2217 -algbera l\u221e /c0 is such an example as there is no bounded linear\nlifting from l\u221e /c0 into l\u221e . (Since l\u221e /c0 contains a C \u2217 -subalgebra \u2217-isomorphic to\nc0 (I) with an uncountable index set I, it cannot be embedded (as a Banach space)\ninto l\u221e which has a separable predual.) We will see that the LP and the LLP are\nequivalent for separable C \u2217 -algebras provided that the QWEP conjecture is true.\nCorollary 3.9. Let A be a separable C \u2217 -algebra and let J \u22b3 C \u2217 F\u221e be such that\nA = C \u2217 F\u221e /J. Then, A has the LP (resp. the LLP) if idA is (resp. locally) ucp\nliftable.\nThere is a criteria when a locally ucp liftable map has a global lifting. This is\ndue to Arveson [Ar2] and its variant is due to Effros and Haagerup [EH]. The\ncondition (ii) in this lemma is satisfied whenever J is nuclear. The separability\ncondition is essential as the quotient from l\u221e onto l\u221e /c0 is not grobally liftable.\nLemma 3.10. Let p : A \u2192 B/J be a ucp map. Then, \u03c6 is ucp liftable provided\nthat A is separable and either (i) or (ii) holds.\n(i) The ucp map \u03c6 can be approximated by ucp liftable maps in the point-norm\ntopology.\n(ii) The ucp map \u03c6 is locally ucp liftable, and moreover for any finite dimensional\noperator systems E \u2282 F \u2282 A, any \u03b5 > 0 and for any cp map \u03b8 : E \u2192 J,\nthere is a cp map \u03b8\u0303 : F \u2192 J with k\u03b8\u0303|E \u2212 \u03b8k < \u03b5.\n\n\fABOUT THE QWEP CONJECTURE\n\n11\n\nProof. Let \u03c0 be the quotient map from B onto B/J and let E1 \u2282 E2 \u2282 * * * \u2282\nA be an increasing sequence of finite dimensional operator system with dense\nunion. We first deal with the case (ii). Let \u03c8n : En \u2192 B be ucp maps such that\nk\u03c6(a) \u2212 \u03c0\u03c8n (a)k < 2\u2212n kak for a \u2208 En . We claim that there is a sequence of ucp\nmaps \u03c8\u0303n : En \u2192 B such that \u03c0 \u03c8\u0303n = \u03c0\u03c8n and k\u03c8\u0303n+1 (a) \u2212 \u03c8\u0303n (a)k < 2\u2212n+2 kak for\nn \u2208 N and a \u2208 En .\nWe proceed by induction. Suppose that \u03c8\u0303n is already constructed. Take \u03b5 > 0\nsufficiently small. Since k\u03c0(\u03c8n+1 (a) \u2212 \u03c8\u0303n (a))k < 2\u2212n+1 kak for a \u2208 En , we can find\na quasicentral approximate unit e \u2208 J with 0 \u2264 e \u2264 1 such that\nk(1 \u2212 e)1/2 (\u03c8n+1 (a) \u2212 \u03c8\u0303n (a))(1 \u2212 e)1/2 k < 2\u2212n+1kak\nand moreover\n\n\u0001\nk\u03c8\u0303n (a) \u2212 e1/2 \u03c8\u0303n (a)e1/2 + (1 \u2212 e)1/2 \u03c8\u0303n (a)(1 \u2212 e)1/2 k < \u03b5kak\n\nfor a \u2208 En (cf. [Ar2]). By the condition (ii), there is a cp map \u03b8\u0303 : En+1 \u2192 J such\nthat k\u03b8\u0303(a) \u2212 e1/2 \u03c8\u0303n (a)e1/2 k < \u03b5kak. We define \u03c8\u0303n+1 by\n\u0001\n\u03c8\u0303n+1 (a) = b\u22121/2 \u03b8\u0303(a) + (1 \u2212 e)1/2 \u03c8n+1 (a)(1 \u2212 e)1/2 b\u22121/2 ,\n\nwhere b = \u03b8\u0303(1) + 1 \u2212 e \u2208 B. Since kb \u2212 1k < \u03b5, we have\n\nk\u03c8\u0303n+1 (a) \u2212 \u03c8\u0303n (a)k < (f (\u03b5) + 2\u2212n+1 )kak\nfor a \u2208 En , where f is a continuous function with f (0) = 0. This proves the\nS claim.\nThe desired ucp lifting \u03c8 : A \u2192 B is now obtained by letting (for a \u2208 En )\n\u03c8(a) = lim \u03c8\u0303n (a).\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nThe proof for the case (i) is similar but easier than the case (ii). Indeed, \u03c8n and\n\u03c8\u0303n in the above proof are defined globally on A (hence no need to choose \u03b8\u0303). \u0003\nThe following is the Choi-Effros lifting theorem [CE].\nCorollary 3.11. Let \u03c6 : A \u2192 B/J be a ucp map. Then, \u03c6 is ucp liftable provided\nthat A is separable and \u03c6 is nuclear, i.e., there is a sequence of ucp maps \u03b2n : A \u2192\nMk(n) and \u03b1n : Mk(n) \u2192 B/J such that \u03b1n \u03b2n converges to \u03c6 pointwise.\nIn particular, a separable nuclear C \u2217 -algebra has the LP.\nProof. It is well-known and not too hard to show that a map \u03b1 from Mk into a\nC \u2217 -algebra C is cp if and only if [\u03b1(eij )]ij \u2208 Mk (C) is positive. It follows that any\nucp map \u03b1 : Mk \u2192 B/J is ucp liftable. The conclusion follows from this fact and\nLemma 3.10.\n\u0003\nThe following is due to Kirchberg [Ki1].\nCorollary 3.12. Let \u03c6 : A \u2192 B/J be a ucp map. If A is a separable C \u2217 -algebra\nwith the LLP and B is QWEP, then \u03c6 is ucp liftable.\n\n\f12\n\nNARUTAKA OZAWA\n\nProof. We may assume B has the WEP. To verify the condition (ii) in Lemma\n3.10, we give ourselves finite dimensional operator systems E \u2282 F \u2282 A, \u03b5 > 0 and\na cp map \u03b8 : E \u2192 J. Since B has the WEP, \u03b8 extends to a ucp map from A into\nB \u2217\u2217 which is still denoted by \u03b8. For a directed set I, let\nY\nBI = {(bi )i\u2208I \u2208\nB : strong\u2217 - lim bi exists in B \u2217\u2217 }\ni\u2208I\n\ni\u2208I\n\nand let \u03c0 : BI \u2192 B \u2217\u2217 be the map which takes (bi )i\u2208I to its limit. Since the adjointoperation and product is jointly strong\u2217 -continuous on bounded sets, BI is a C \u2217 algebra and \u03c0 is a \u2217-homomorphism. Choosing the directed set I appropriately,\nwe may assume that \u03c0 is surjective. Since A has the LLP, there is a ucp map\n\u03c8 : F \u2192 BI such that \u03b8|F = \u03c0\u03c8. It follows that there is a net of ucp maps\n\u03c8i : F \u2192 B such that the net \u03c8i |E converges to \u03b8 in the pointwise weak topology.\nTaking convex combinations and multiplying by an approximate unit, we find a\ndesired cp map \u03b8\u0303 : F \u2192 J.\n\u0003\nThe converse is also true. For the proof, see [Oz1].\nProposition 3.13. A separable C \u2217 -algebra A has the LLP if and only if any ucp\nmap from A into the Calkin algebra B(l2 )/K(l2 ) is ucp liftable.\nIt might be the case that any ucp map from a separable C \u2217 -algebra into the\nCalkin algebra B(l2 )/K(l2 ) dilates to a \u2217-homomorphism into M2 (B(l2 )/K(l2 )).\nIf it is the case, then it would imply that a separable C \u2217 -algebra has the LLP if\nand only if Ext(A) is a group. Recall that the (unitized) cone of a C \u2217 -algebra A is\ndefined to be cone(A) = {f \u2208 C([0, 1], A) : f (0) \u2208 C1}. By an ingeneous argument\non the cone, Kirchberg [Ki1] proved that a separable C \u2217 -algebra A has the LLP if\nand only if Ext(cone(A)) is a group.\nKirchberg [Ki2][Ki1] proved the following important theorem and its corollary.\nTheorem 3.14. We have C \u2217 F\u221e \u2297min B(l2 ) = C \u2217 F\u221e \u2297max B(l2 ).\nWe will present an elegant and simple proof of Pisier [Pi1]. To this end, let En\nbe the n-dimensional operator space in C \u2217 F\u221e spanned by 1 = U0 , U1 , . . . , Un\u22121 ,\nwhere U1 , U2 , . . . are the canonical generators of C \u2217 FP\nobvious that\n\u221e .

This gives rise to the canonical one-to-one correspondence\nPn\u22121\nUk \u2297 xk \u2208 En \u2297 B(l2 ) and a map\nbetween an element z = k=0\nz\u0303 :\n\nln\u221e\n\n\u220b\n\nn\u22121\n(\u03b1k )k=0\n\n7\u2212\u2192\n\nn\u22121\nX\n\n\u03b1k xk \u2208 B(l2 ).\n\nk=0\n\nLemma 3.15. The above operator space En is canonically completely isometrically\nisomorphic to the dual operator space ln1 = (ln\u221e )\u2217 , or equivalently, kzkmin = kz\u0303kcb\nfor every z \u2208 En \u2297 B(l2 ).\n\n\fABOUT THE QWEP CONJECTURE\n\n13\n\nn\u22121\nn\u22121\n),\nProof. Since (Uk )k=0\n\u2208 En \u2297min l\u221e is contractive and z = (idEn \u2297 z\u0303)((Uk )k=0\nwe have kzkmin \u2264 kz\u0303kcb . To prove the converse inequality, we give ourselves\ncontractions a0 , . . . , an\u22121 \u2208 B(H). Let \u00e2k \u2208 M2 (B(H)) be their unitary dilations\n(cf. the proof of Theorem 3.8). It follows that the map \u03c6 : En \u2192 M2 (B(H))\ndefined by \u03c6(Uk ) = \u00e2\u22121\n0 \u00e2k , k = 0, . . . , n \u2212 1 is completely contractive since it\nextends to a \u2217-homomorphism on C \u2217 F\u221e . Hence, the map \u03b8 : En \u2192 B(H) defined\nby \u03b8(Uk ) = (\u00e20 \u03c6(Uk ))11 = ak , k = 0, . . . , n \u2212 1 is also completely contractive.\nn\u22121\nTherefore, we have k(idB(H) \u2297z\u0303)((ak )k=0\n)kmin = k(\u03b8\u2297idB(l2 ) )(z)kmin \u2264 kzkmin . Since\nn\u22121\nthe contraction (ak )k=0\n\u2208 B(H)\u2297min ln\u221e was arbitrary, we have kz\u0303kcb \u2264 kzkmin . \u0003\n\nThe dual operator space structure ln1 = (ln\u221e )\u2217 coincides with so called the maximal operator space structure [Pa2].\nLemma 3.16. Let Xi \u2282 B(Hi ) (i = 1, 2) be unital operator spaces and let \u03c6 : X1 \u2192\nX2 be a unital complete isometry. Suppose that X2 is spanned by unitaries in\nB(H2 ). Then, \u03c6 uniquely extends to a \u2217-homomorphism between C \u2217 -subalgebras\nC \u2217 (Xi ) in B(Hi ).\nProof. By Theorem 2.2, \u03c6 extends to a complete contraction from B(H1 ) into\nB(H2 ), which is still denoted by \u03c6. Since \u03c6 is unital, it has to be a ucp map.\nSince \u03c6|X1 is isometric and X2 is spanned by unitaries, X1 is contained in the\nmultiplicative domain of \u03c6 (cf. Definition 2.7 and the following remarks).\n\u0003\nProof of Theorem 3.14. Thanks to Lemma 3.16, it suffices to show that the formal\nidentity map from En \u2297min B(l2 ) into C \u2217 F\u221e \u2297max B(l2 ) is completely contractive\nPn\u22121\nfor every n. We give ourselves z = k=0\nUk \u2297 xk \u2208 En \u2297 B(l2 ) with kzkmin = 1.\nBy Lemma 3.15, the corresponding map z\u0303 : ln\u221e \u2192 B(l2 ) is completely contractive.\nHence, by the Stinespring-type theorem for cb maps, there are a Hilbert space\nH, a representation \u03c0 : ln\u221e \u2192 B(H) and contractions V, W \u2208 B(l2 , H) such that\nz\u0303(f ) = V \u2217 \u03c0(f )W for f \u2208 ln\u221e . We may assume that H = l2 . Then, ak = \u03c0(\u03b4k )V\nand b = \u03c0(\u03b4k )W are in B(l2 ), and satisfy xk = a\u2217k bk for k = 0, . . . , n \u2212 1 and\nPn\u22121 \u2217\nPn\u22121k \u2217\nk=0 bk bk \u2264 1. It follows that\nk=0 ak ak \u2264 1,\nk\n\nn\u22121\nX\n\nUk \u2297xk kC \u2217 F\u221e \u2297max B(l2 ) = k\n\nk=0\n\nn\u22121\nX\n\n(1 \u2297 ak )\u2217 (Uk \u2297 bk )kC \u2217 F\u221e \u2297max B(l2 )\n\nk=0\n\n\u2264k\n\nn\u22121\nX\nk=0\n\n(1 \u2297 ak )\u2217 (1 \u2297 ak )k1/2\nmax k\n\nn\u22121\nX\n\n(Uk \u2297 bk )\u2217 (Uk \u2297 bk )k1/2\nmax \u2264 1.\n\nk=0\n\nThis shows that the formal identity from En \u2297min B(l2 ) into C \u2217 F\u221e \u2297max B(l2 ) is\ncontractive. Since B(l2 ) is stable, it is also completely contractive.\n\u0003\nWe remark that the fact that C \u2217 F\u221e has the LLP was not used in the proof of\nTheorem 3.14. Combining this theorem with Theorems 3.3, 3.6 and Corollary 3.9,\nwe obtain the following.\n\n\f14\n\nNARUTAKA OZAWA\n\nCorollary 3.17. For A and B, we have the following.\n(i) A \u2297min B = A \u2297max B if A has the LLP and B has the WEP.\n(ii) A \u2297min B(l2 ) = A \u2297max B(l2 ) if and only if A has the LLP.\n(iii) C \u2217 F\u221e \u2297min B = C \u2217 F\u221e \u2297max B if and only if B has the WEP.\nWe remark that both the WEP and the LLP (and the LP for separable C \u2217 algebras) are stable under taking a tensor product with a nuclear C \u2217 -algebra, and\ntaking a crossed product by an amenable group. This fact easily follows from the\nabove corollary (or the completely positive approximation property).\nCorollary 3.18. Let Ai (i = 1, 2) be C \u2217 -algebras and let \u03c0i : C \u2217 F \u2192 Ai be \u2217homomorphisms. If at least one of Ai 's is QWEP, then the \u2217-homomorphism\n\u03c01 \u2297 \u03c02 : C \u2217 F \u2297 C \u2217 F \u2192 A1 \u2297max A2 is continuous w.r.t. the minimal tensor product.\nProof. Thanks to Proposition 3.4, we may assume that Ai 's are separable and the\nfree group F is countable. Suppose that A2 = B/J and B has the WEP. Since\nC \u2217 F has the LLP, \u03c02 lifts to a ucp map \u03c82 : C \u2217 F \u2192 B. It follows that\nid\u2297\u03c82\n\n\u03c01 \u2297Q\n\n\u03c01 \u2297 \u03c02 : C \u2217 F \u2297min C \u2217 F \u2212\u2192 C \u2217 F \u2297min B = C \u2217 F \u2297max B \u2212\u2192 A1 \u2297max A2\nis continuous.\n\n\u0003\n\nChoi [Ch2] proved that the C \u2217 -algbera C \u2217 F\u221e is residually finite dimensional, i.e.,\nit has a faithful family of finite dimensional representations. It follows that C \u2217 F\u221e\nhas a faithful trace. Kirchberg [Ki1] observed that his conjecture is equivalent to\nthe above for F\u221e \u00d7 F\u221e . We note that Bekka [Be] proved that the full C \u2217 -algebra\nof a residually finite group need not be residually finite dimensional (e.g. SL3 (Z)).\nProposition 3.19. The following conjectures are equivalent.\n(i) We have C \u2217 F\u221e \u2297min C \u2217 F\u221e = C \u2217 F\u221e \u2297max C \u2217 F\u221e .\n(ii) The full C \u2217 -algebra C \u2217 (F\u221e \u00d7 F\u221e ) is residually finite dimensional.\n(iii) The full C \u2217 -algebra C \u2217 (F\u221e \u00d7 F\u221e ) has a faithful trace.\n(iv) The C \u2217 -algebra C \u2217 F\u221e has the WEP.\n(v) All separable C \u2217 -algebras are QWEP.\n(vi) The LLP implies the WEP.\nProof. We note that C \u2217 (F\u221e \u00d7 F\u221e ) = C \u2217 F\u221e \u2297max C \u2217 F\u221e canonically. The implications (i)\u21d2(ii)\u21d2(iii) are trivial and (iii)\u21d2(i) follows from Lemma 3.20 below.\nThe implications (i)\u21d2(iv)\u21d2(v) and (vi)\u21d2(i) follow from Corollary 3.17. For\n(v)\u21d2(vi), we prove that a C \u2217 -algebra A with the LLP and QWEP has the WEP.\nLet A \u2282 B(H) and let \u03c0 be a quotient onto A from a C \u2217 -algebra B with the WEP.\nFix a finite dimensional operator system E \u2282 A, and let \u03c8E : E \u2192 B be a ucp\nlifting. Since B has the WEP, \u03c8E extends to a ucp map \u03c8\u0303E : B(H) \u2192 B \u2217\u2217 . It\nfollows that \u03c6E = \u03c0 \u2217\u2217 \u03c8\u0303E is a ucp map which coincides with the identity on E.\nAny cluster point of the net of ucp maps \u03c6E : B(H) \u2192 A\u2217\u2217 in the pointwise weak\u2217\ntopology is a desired weak expectation. This completes the proof.\n\u0003\n\n\fABOUT THE QWEP CONJECTURE\n\n15\n\nLemma 3.20. Any trace on the maximal tensor product A1 \u2297max A2 factors through\nthe minimal tensor product A1 \u2297min A2 .\nProof. It suffices to show the assertion for extremal traces. It is well-known and\nnot too hard to see that a trace is extremal if and only if its GNS representation\ngenerates a finite factor. Let \u03c4 be an extremal trace on A1 \u2297max A2 with the GNS\nrepresentation \u03c0 and let \u03c0i : Ai \u2192 M := \u03c0(A1 \u2297max A2 )\u2032\u2032 be the restriction of \u03c0 to\nAi . It follows that Mi := \u03c0i (Ai )\u2032\u2032 are commuting von Neumann subalgebras of M,\nwhich have to be factors. By uniqueness of the trace on a finite factor, we have\n \u0304 2.\n\u03c4M (a1 a2 ) = \u03c4M1 (a1 )\u03c4M2 (a2 ) for ai \u2208 \u03c0i (Ai ), which means that M = M1 \u2297M\n\u0003\nRecall the notations used in the proof of Theorem 3.14. According to Lemma 3.16,\nC \u2217 F\u221e \u2297max C \u2217 F\u221e = C \u2217 F\u221e \u2297min C \u2217 F\u221e if and only if the formal identity \u03b8n from\nEn \u2297min En into C \u2217 F\u221e \u2297max C \u2217 F\u221e is completely contractive for every/some n \u2265 3.\nIt follows from a Grothendieck-type factorization theorem of Junge [Ju], Paulsen\n[Pa2] and Pisier [Pi2] that k\u03b8n k \u2264 2 for all n \u2208 N. However, no nontrivial estimates of k\u03b8n kcb is known. It is known that the C \u2217 -subalgebra in C \u2217 F\u221e \u2297min C \u2217 F\u221e\ngenerated by its \"diagonal\" {s \u2297 s : s \u2208 F\u221e } is canonically \u2217-isomorphic to C \u2217 F\u221e .\n\u2217\nIndeed, since Cred\nF\u221e is QWEP (cf. the remark at the end of Section 4), the \u2217\u2217\n\u2217\nhomomorphism C \u2217 F\u221e \u2297min C \u2217 F\u221e \u2192 Cred\nF\u221e \u2297max Cred\nF\u221e is continuous thanks\nto Corollary 3.18. The claim now follows from Pisier's observation [Pi2] that the\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\"diagonal\" in Cred\n\u0393 \u2297max Cred\n\u0393 is canonically \u2217-isomorphic to C \u2217 \u0393 for any discrete\ngroup \u0393.\nThe following is proved by Pisier [Pi1] and Boca [Bo].\nProposition 3.21. The LLP (resp. the LP for separable C \u2217 -algebras) is stable\nunder a full free product.\nBy modifying Pisier's proof [Pi1], one can prove that the LLP is stable under a\nfull amalgamated free product over a finite dimensional C \u2217 -subalgebra. Indeed, if\nAi (i = 1, 2) are C \u2217 -algebras with a common C \u2217 -subalgebra B, then the linear span\nof A1 A2 in the full amalgamated free product A1 \u2217B A2 is canonically completely\nisometrically isomorphic to the relative Haagerup tensor product A1 \u2297hB A2 :=\nA1 \u2297h A2 /NB , where NB = span{a1 x \u2297 a2 \u2212 a1 \u2297 xa2 : ai \u2208 Ai , x \u2208 B}. Hence if B\nis finite dimensional, then there is a completely contractive lifting from A1 \u2297hB A2\ninto A1 \u2297h A2 . It follows from Lemma 3.16 that the canonical quotient map from\nA1 \u2217 A2 onto A1 \u2217B A2 is locally ucp liftable whenever B is finite dimensional. It is\nnot known whether the full amalgamated free product (over a finite dimensional\nC \u2217 -subalgebra) preserves the LP.\nThe LLP (resp. the LP) also passes to a (resp. separable) weakly cp complemented C \u2217 -subalgebra. It is not known whether the LLP (resp. the LP) is stable\nunder the maximal tensor product, or equivalently whether the full C \u2217 -algebra\nC \u2217 (F\u221e \u00d7 F\u221e ) has the LLP (resp. the LP). It seems related to the QWEP conjecture, but we have found no logical connection. Although it seems full group\n\n\f16\n\nNARUTAKA OZAWA\n\nC \u2217 -algebras rarely have the LLP, there is no example of groups whose full C \u2217 algebra is known to fail the LLP. It was observed in [Oz3] that there is a group\nwhose full C \u2217 -algebra does not have the LP. We note that the full C \u2217 -algebra C \u2217 \u0393\nhas the LLP if and only if any positive definite function from \u0393 into the Calkin\nalgebra B(l2 )/K(l2 ) has a positive definite lifting.\n4. Permanence Properties of the QWEP\nFollowing Kirchberg [Ki1], we study the permanence properties of the QWEP.\nProposition 4.1. We have the following.\n\nQ\n(i) If Ai is QWEP for all i \u2208 I, then so is i\u2208I Ai .\n(ii) If A \u2282 B is weakly cp complemented and B is QWEP, then so is A.\n(iii) Let (Ai )i\u2208I be an increasing net of (possibly non-unital) C \u2217 -subalgebras in A\n(resp. M) whose union is dense in norm (resp. weak\u2217) topology. If all Ai are\nQWEP, then so is A (resp. M).\n(iv) A C \u2217 -algebra A is QWEP if and only if the second dual A\u2217\u2217 is QWEP.\n(v) If A is QWEP and B is nuclear, then A \u2297min B is QWEP. If M and N are\n \u0304\nQWEP, then so is M \u2297N.\n(vi) If A (resp. M) is QWEP and \u03b1 is an action of amenable group \u0393, then \u0393\u22c9\u03b1 A\n(resp. \u0393 \u22c9\u03b1 M) is QWEP.\n(vii) The commutant\nM \u2032 is QWEP if and only if M is QWEP.\nR\u2295\n(viii) Let M =\nM(\u03b3) d\u03b3 be the direct integral of separable von Neumann algebras. Then, M is QWEP if and only if M(\u03b3) are QWEP for a.e. \u03b3.\nProof. Ad(i): This follows from Lemma 3.2.\nAd(ii): Let J be an ideal in C with the WEP such that B = C/J and let\n\u03c0 : C \u2192 B be the quotient map. Then, the C \u2217 -subalgebra \u03c0 \u22121 (A) is weakly cp\ncomplemented in C and thus has the WEP. Indeed, this follows from Lemma 3.2\nand the fact\n\u03c0 \u22121 (A)\u2217\u2217 = J \u2217\u2217 \u2295 A\u2217\u2217 \u2282 J \u2217\u2217 \u2295 B \u2217\u2217 = C \u2217\u2217 .\nHence, A is a quotient of \u03c0 \u22121 (A) which has the WEP.\nS\nAd(iii): Let M be the weak\u2217 -closure of A = Ai . We will prove that M is\nQWEP. (Then the QWEP property of A follows from (ii) by considering the case\nwhere M = A\u2217\u2217 .) By the Kaplansky density theorem, Ball(A) is strong\u2217 -dense\nin Ball(M). Hence, amplifying the directed set I if necessary,\nwe may assume\nQ\nthat for any x \u2208 Ball(M), there is aQnet (ai )i\u2208I \u2208 Ball( i\u2208I Ai ) such that x =\nstrong\u2217 - limi\u2208I ai We denote by C = i\u2208I Ai . The C \u2217 -algebra C is QWEP by (i).\nLet\nB = {(ai )i\u2208I \u2208 C : strong\u2217 - lim ai exists in M}\ni\u2208I\n\n\fABOUT THE QWEP CONJECTURE\n\n17\n\nand let \u03c0 : B \u2192 M be the map which takes (ai )i\u2208I to its limit. Since the adjointoperation and product is jointly strong\u2217 -continuous on bounded sets, B is a C \u2217 subalgebra of C and \u03c0 is a surjective \u2217-homomorphism onto M. We claim that B\nis weakly cp complemented in C. Let (ej )j be an increasing approximate unit for\nJ = ker \u03c0 and let e = limj ej \u2208 C \u2217\u2217 . We note that e is in the center of B \u2217\u2217 and\nB \u2217\u2217 = B \u2217\u2217 e \u2295 B \u2217\u2217 (1 \u2212 e) = J \u2217\u2217 \u2295 M \u2217\u2217 . Since J is hereditary in C (i.e., ei xei \u2208 J\nfor all x \u2208 C), we have eC \u2217\u2217 e = J \u2217\u2217 . For a fixed free ultrafilter \u03c9 on I, the map\ndefined by\n\u03c0\u0303 : C \u220b (ai )i\u2208I 7\u2212\u2192 weak\u2217 - lim ai \u2208 M\ni\u2208\u03c9\n\nis a ucp extension of \u03c0. This ucp extension gives rise to a conditional expectation\nfrom (1 \u2212 e)C \u2217\u2217 (1 \u2212 e) onto B \u2217\u2217 (1 \u2212 e) = M \u2217\u2217 . It follows that\nB \u2217\u2217 = J \u2217\u2217 \u2295 M \u2217\u2217 \u2282 eC \u2217\u2217 e \u2295 (1 \u2212 e)C \u2217\u2217 (1 \u2212 e)\nis cp complemented. This proves our claim and we are done by (ii).\nAd(iv): This follows from (ii) and (iii).\nNote. We are not going to use (v) to (vii) of this proposition and the proof requires\nsome results which will be proved later.\nAd(v): The first assertion follows from the fact that the tensor product of a WEP\n\u2217\nC -algebra with a nuclear C \u2217 -algebra again has the WEP. The second assertion\nfollows from Corollary 5.3 (or Corollary 6.2) and the following result of Tomiyama\n[To]. If \u03c6 : M1 \u2192 M2 is a (not necessarily weak\u2217 -continuous) ucp map between von\nNeumann algebras, then the map \u03c6 \u2297 idN : M1 \u2297 N \u2192 M2 \u2297 N extends to a ucp\n \u0304 N : M1 \u2297N\n \u0304 \u2192 M2 \u2297N.\n \u0304\nmap \u03c6\u2297id\nIndeed, this follows from the fact that (M2 )\u2217 \u2297 N\u2217\n \u0304\nis dense in M2 \u2297N.\nAd(vi): The assertion for von Neumann algebras follows from that for C \u2217 algebras. Let (A, \u0393, \u03b1) be a C \u2217 -dynamical system with \u0393 amenable. We claim\nthat there are nets of ucp maps \u03c8i : \u0393 \u22c9 A \u2192 Mn(i) (A) and \u03c6i : Mn(i) (A) \u2192 \u0393 \u22c9 A\nsuch that \u03c6i \u03c8i converges to id\u0393\u22c9A pointwisely. Once this is proved, then the QWEP\nproperty of \u0393 \u22c9 A follows from that of A (cf. Corollary 5.3).\nTake a faithful representation \u03c0 : A \u2192 B(H) with a unitary action u of \u0393 on H\nwhich implements the action \u03b1. i.e., \u03c0(\u03b1s (a)) = Ad us (\u03c0(a)) for a \u2208 A. Then, we\nhave \u0393 \u22c9 A \u2282 B(l2 \u0393 \u2297 H) where \u0393 \u220b s 7\u2192 \u03bbs \u2297 1 \u2208 B(l2 \u0393 \u2297 H) and A \u220b a 7\u2192 \u03c0\u0303(a) \u2208\nB(l2 \u0393 \u2297 H) with \u03c0\u0303(a)(\u03b4s \u2297 \u03be) = \u03b4s \u2297 \u03b1s\u22121 (a)\u03be. We fix a finite subset F \u2282 \u0393. The\ncompression of B(l2 \u0393) to B(l2 F ) = MF defines a ucp map \u03c8F : \u0393 \u22c9 A \u2192 MF (A).\nLet \u03c6F : MF (A) \u2192 B(l2 \u0393 \u2297 H) be the ucp map defined by \u03c6F (x) = VF\u2217 (1 \u2297 x)VF ,\nwhere the isometry VF is given by\n1 X\nVF : l2 \u0393 \u2297 H \u220b \u03b4s \u2297 \u03be 7\u2212\u2192 p\n\u03b4t\u22121 s \u2297 \u03b4t \u2297 ut\u22121 s \u03be \u2208 l2 \u0393 \u2297 l2 F \u2297 H.\n|F | t\u2208F\nA direct computation shows that \u03c6F (est,t \u2297 a) =\n\n\u03c6F maps into \u0393 \u22c9 A and \u03c6F \u03c8F (\u03bbs \u03c0\u0303(a)) =\n\n1\n(\u03bbs\n|F |\n\n|sF \u2229F |\n\u03bbs \u03c0\u0303(a).\n|F |\n\n\u2297 1)\u03c0\u0303(\u03b1t (a)). Therefore,\n\nThis proves the claim.\n\n\f18\n\nNARUTAKA OZAWA\n\nAd(vii): This follows from standard representation theory of von Neumann algebras.\nAd(viii): Suppose M is QWEP and let A be a separable weak\u2217 -dense C \u2217 subalgebra which is weakly cp complemented in M (cf. Proposition 3.4). Then, A is\nQWEP by (ii) in this proposition. Since almost all M(\u03b3) arise as the weak\u2217 -closure\nof representations of A, they are QWEP. Conversely, suppose M(\u03b3) are QWEP for\na.e. \u03b3 and let \u03c0 (resp. \u03c0 \u2032 ) be a \u2217-homomorphism from C \u2217 F\u221e onto a weak\u2217 -dense\nC \u2217 -subalgebra of M (resp. M \u2032 ). Since \u03c0\u03b3 * \u03c0\u03b3\u2032 is coninuous w.r.t. the minimal tensor\nR\u2295\nproduct for a.e. \u03b3 (cf. Corollary 3.18), the representation \u03c0 * \u03c0 \u2032 =\n\u03c0\u03b3 * \u03c0\u03b3\u2032 d\u03b3 is\n\u2217\nalso coninuous w.r.t. the minimal tensor product. If C F\u221e \u2282 B(H), then one can\nshow that \u03c0 : C \u2217 F\u221e \u2192 M extends to a ucp map \u03c0\u0303 : B(H) \u2192 M (cf. the proof of\nTheorem 3.3). The QWEP property of M now follows from Corollary 5.3.\n\u0003\nIt is not known whether the minimal tensor product of QWEP C \u2217 -algebras is\nagain QWEP, or equivalently whether B(l2 ) \u2297min B(l2 ) is QWEP or not. We note\nthat this C \u2217 -algebra fails the WEP as shown in [Oz2].\nHaagerup [Ha1] showed that there is a sequence of (complete) contractions\n\u2217\n\u03c6n : LF2 \u2192 Cred\nF2 =: A such that limn \u03c6n (a) = a for a \u2208 A. Let \u03c6 : LF2 \u2192 A\u2217\u2217\nbe a cluster point of the sequence \u03c6n . Then, \u03c6 is a unital (complete) contraction\n\u2217\nsuch that \u03c6|A = idA . This shows that Cred\nF2 is weakly cp complemented in LF2\n\u2217\n(cf. Theorem 2.9). (It follows that Cred F2 is weakly cp complemented in any C \u2217 superalgebra with a trace.) Since LF2 is QWEP (cf. Proposition 7.3), the reduced\n\u2217\ngroup C \u2217 -algebra Cred\nF2 is also QWEP. However, it seems unknown whether the\n\u2217\n\u2217\nreduced group C -algebra Cred\n\u0393 of, say, \u0393 = SL3 (Z) is QWEP or not.\n5. Finite Representability in the Trace Class\nFollowing Kirchberg [Ki1], we study the relation between the QWEP property\nand finite representability.\nDefinition 5.1. The Banach-Mazur distance d between two Banach spaces E and\nF is defined by\n\u22121\nd(E, F ) = inf{k\u03b8k k\u03b8 k : \u03b8 : E \u2192 F a continuous linear isomorphism}.\n\nWe put d(E, F ) = \u221e when E is not isomorphic to F . We say a Banach space X is\nfinitely representable in a Banach space Y if for every finite dimensional subspace\nE of X, one has inf{d(E, F ) : F \u2282 Y } = 1.\nSimilarly, the cb Banach-Mazur distance dcb and os finite representability are\ndefined by just replacing the usual norm with the cb norm in the above definitions.\nFor a Banach space X, we denote by Ball(X) (resp. Ball(X)) the open (resp.\nclosed) unit ball of X. A map \u03c6 : X \u2192 Y is called a metric surjection if it\nmaps Ball(X) onto Ball(Y ), i.e., X/ ker \u03c6 = Y isometrically. If Y embeds into X\n\n\fABOUT THE QWEP CONJECTURE\n\n19\n\nisometrically, then the transpose of the isometric inclusion is a weak\u2217 -continuous\nmetric surjection which maps Ball(X \u2217 ) onto Ball(Y \u2217 ).\nProposition 5.2. For von Neumann algebras M and N, we have the following.\n(i) If M\u2217 embeds into N\u2217 isometrically, then there is a weak\u2217 -continuous unital\nmetric surjection \u03c6 from N onto M.\n(ii) If there is a weak\u2217 -continuous unital metric surjection \u03c6 from N onto M,\nthen there are projections p and q in N such that M is \u2217-isomorphic to a\n(normally) cp complemented von Neumann subalgebra of pNp \u2295 (qNq)op .\nProof. Ad(i): Let \u03c60 : N \u2192 M be the transpose of an isometric embedding of M\u2217\ninto N\u2217 . Let v be an extreme point of the weak\u2217 -closed face {x \u2208 N : kxk \u2264\n1 and \u03c60 (x) = 1} of Ball(N). It follows from a standard argument (cf. [Sa]) that\nv is a partial isometry and \u03c60 (vv \u2217 x) = \u03c60 (x). Hence, the map \u03c6 : N \u2192 M defined\nby \u03c6(x) = \u03c60 (vx) is the desired unital metric surjection.\nAd(ii): Let \u03c6 be a weak\u2217 -continuous unital metric surjection from N onto M.\nLet e \u2208 N be the support projection of \u03c6, i.e., 1 \u2212 e = sup{a \u2208 N : 0 \u2264 a \u2264\n1 and \u03c6(a) = 0}. (We note that a \u2265 0 and \u03c6(a) = 0 implies that \u03c6 is zero on the\nsupport projection of a.) It follows that \u03c6(a) = \u03c6(eae) for every a \u2208 N and that\n\u03c6(a) 6= 0 for all positive non-zero element a \u2208 eNe. Let C \u2282 eNe be the Jordan\nmultiplicative domain for \u03c6|eN e , i.e.,\nC = {a \u2208 eNe : \u03c6(a\u2217 \u25e6 a) = \u03c6(a)\u2217 \u25e6 \u03c6(a)}\n= {a \u2208 eNe : \u03c6(a \u25e6 x) = \u03c6(a) \u25e6 \u03c6(x) for all x \u2208 eNe}.\nBy Corollary 2.6 and the following remark, C is a weak\u2217 -closed Jordan subalgebra\nin eNe and \u03c6|C is a normal Jordan isomorphism from C onto M. Hence, \u03b8 =\n(\u03c6|C )\u22121 is a normal Jordan isomorphism from M onto C with \u03c6\u03b8 = idM . By\nTheorem 2.10, there is a projection p in C \u2032 \u2229 eNe with q := e \u2212 p such that\nthe map \u03b81 : M \u220b x 7\u2192 \u03b8(x)p \u2208 pNp (resp. \u03b82 : M \u220b x 7\u2192 \u03b8(x)q \u2208 qNq) is a\n\u2217-homomorphism (resp. \u2217-antihomomorphism). It follows that the map\n\u0001\n\u03b8\u0303 : M \u220b x 7\u2212\u2192 (\u03b81 (x), \u03b82 (x)op \u2208 pNp \u2295 (qNq)op\ndefines a normal unital injective \u2217-homomorphism and the map\n\n\u03c6\u0303 : pNp \u2295 (qNq)op \u220b (a, bop ) 7\u2212\u2192 \u03c6(a + b) \u2208 M\ndefines a unital positive map such that \u03c6\u0303\u03b8\u0303 = idM . Therefore, the map \u03b8\u0303 \u03c6\u0303 is a\nweak\u2217 -continuous contractive projection onto the von Neumann subalgebra \u03b8\u0303(M)\nin pNp \u2295 (qNq)op . We complete the proof by Theorem 2.9.\n\u0003\nCorollary 5.3. For a von Neumann algebra M, the following are equivalent.\n(i) The von Neumann algebra M is QWEP.\n(ii) There are a Hilbert space H and a ucp map \u03c6 : B(H) \u2192 M which maps\nBall(B(H)) onto Ball(M).\n\n\f20\n\nNARUTAKA OZAWA\n\n(iii) The predual M\u2217 of M is (os) finitely representable in the trace class S1 .\n(iv) There is a QWEP C \u2217 -algebra A and a contraction \u03c6 : A \u2192 M such that\n\u03c6(Ball(A)) is weak\u2217 -dense in Ball(M).\nMoreover, we can choose the Hilbert space H in (ii) separable when so is M.\nProof. Ad(i)\u21d2(ii): Let B \u2282 B(H) be a C \u2217 -algebra with the WEP and let \u03c0 be\na surjective \u2217-homomorphism from B onto M. Since B has the WEP, there is\na ucp map \u03c8 : B(H) \u2192 B \u2217\u2217 with \u03c8|B = idB . It follows that the composition\n\u03c6 = \u03c0\u0303\u03c8 of \u03c8 and the normal extension \u03c0\u0303 : B \u2217\u2217 \u2192 M of \u03c0 is a ucp map such\nthat \u03c6(Ball(B(H))) = Ball(M). If M is separable, then there is a separable C \u2217 subalgebra A in B(H) such that \u03c6(Ball(A)) is weak\u2217 -dense in Ball(M). Let \u03b8 : A \u2192\nB(l2 ) be a faithful representation and let \u03c3 : B(l2 ) \u2192 B(H) be a ucp extension of\n\u2217\n\u03b8\u22121 . It follows that \u03c60 = \u03c6\u03c3 is a ucp map such that \u03c60 (Ball(B(l\nQ 2 ))) is weak -dense\nin Ball(M). Fixing a free ultrafilter \u03c9 on N, we define \u03a6 : n\u2208N B(l2 ) \u2192 M by\n\u03a6((an )n\u2208N ) = weak\u2217 - lim \u03c60 (an ) \u2208 M.\nn\u2208\u03c9\n\nQ\nSince M\u2217 is separable, the ucp map \u03a6 maps Ball( n\u2208N B(l2 )) onto Ball(M).\nAd(ii)\u21d2(iii): A metric surjection between C \u2217 -algebras which is ucp is automatically a complete metric surjection (cf. Corollary 2.6). If \u03c6 : B(H) \u2192 M is a ucp\nmetric surjection, then \u03c6\u2217 : M \u2217 \u2192 B(H)\u2217 is completely isometric. By the principle\nof local reflexivity, B(H)\u2217 is finitely representable in B(H)\u2217 = S1 (H). The operator\nspace analogue of the principle of local reflexivity for S1 (H) is a deep theorem of\nJunge [Ju] (see [EJR] for a more general result).\nAd(iii)\u21d2(iv):\nLet (Ei )i\u2208I be an increasing net of finite dimensional subspaces in\nS\nM\u2217 with Ei = M\u2217 . By the assumption, there is an embedding \u03c8i : Ei \u2192 S1 for\neach i \u2208 I such that k\u03c8i k \u2264 1 + (dimQEi )\u22121 and k\u03c8i\u22121 k \u2264 1. Fixing a free ultrafilter\n\u03c9 on I, we define a contraction \u03c6 : i\u2208I B(l2 ) \u2192 M by\nh\u03c6((ai )i\u2208I ), f i = limhxi , \u03c8i (f )i\ni\u2208\u03c9\n\nQ\n\nfor (ai )i\u2208I \u2208 i\u2208I B(l2 ) and f \u2208 M\u2217 (since f \u2208 Ei eventually, the limit in the\nabove definition makes sense).

Connes' Embedding Problem\nLet \u03c9 be a fixed free ultrafilter on N and let R be the hyperfinite II1 -factorQwhose\nfaithful normal trace is denoted simply by \u03c4 .

The ultrapower R\u03c9 of the hyperfinite II1 -factor R\nis defined to be the von Neumann algebra generated by the GNS representation\n\u03c9\nassociated with\nQ \u03c4\u03c9 . We\u2217 still denote by \u03c4\u03c9 the faithful trace\nQ on R \u03c9. It turns\nQ out that\nN\u03c9 = {a \u2208 R : \u03c4\u03c9 (a a) = 0} is a maximal ideal in R and R = ( R)/N\u03c9 (as\na C \u2217 -algebra) is a II1 -factor which is not separable.\nLet A be a C \u2217 -algebra and \u03c4 be a trace on A with the GNS-triplet (\u03c0\u03c4 , H\u03c4 , \u03be\u03c4 ).\nWe denote by \u03c0\u03c4c the representation of the conjugate C \u2217 -algebra \u0100 of A on H\u03c4\ndefined by \u03c0\u03c4c (b\u0304)\u03c0\u03c4 (a)\u03be\u03c4 = \u03c0\u03c4 (ab\u2217 )\u03be\u03c4 for a, b \u2208 A.

To prove (ii), we give ourselves\na finite set F of unitaries in A and \u03b5 > 0. We approximate the A-central state\n\u03c6 by Tr(h * ), where h is a positive trace class operator with Tr(h) = 1.

If A \u2229 K(H) = {0}, then by Glimm's theorem the ucp map\n\u03b8 : A \u2192 Mq is approximated by compressions to q-dimensional subspaces in H.\nSince A is spanned by unitaries, this completes\nP the proof of (i)\u21d2(ii).\nP\n\u2217\nAd(ii)\u21d2(iii): Since \u03bcn : Mn \u2297min M\u0304n \u220b\nk xk \u2297 \u0233k 7\u2192 trn (\nk xk yk ) \u2208 C are\nstates for all n, the net of states \u03bcn(i) (\u03b8i \u2297 \u03b8 \u0304i ) on A \u2297min \u0100 is well-defined and\nconverges to the functional \u03bc\u03c4 .\nAd(iii)\u21d2(iv): This follows from the fact that \u03be\u03c4 is cyclic for \u03c3\u03c4 (A \u2297 \u0100) and the\ncorresponding vector state \u03bc\u03c4 is continuous w.r.t. the minimal tensor product.\n\n\fABOUT THE QWEP CONJECTURE\n\n23\n\nAd(iv)\u21d2(i): Let \u03a8 : B(H) \u2297min \u0100 \u2192 B(H\u03c4 ) be a ucp extension of \u03c3\u03c4 and let\n\u03c8 : B(H) \u220b x 7\u2192 \u03a8(x \u2297 1) \u2208 B(H\u03c4 ). Since \u03a8 is an (A \u2297min \u0100)-bimodule map, we\nhave \u03c0\u03c4c (b\u0304)\u03c8(x) = \u03a8(x \u2297 b\u0304) = \u03c8(x)\u03c0\u03c4c (b\u0304) for all x \u2208 B(H) and b\u0304 \u2208 \u0100. It follows\nthat \u03c8(B(H)) \u2282 \u03c0\u03c4c (\u0100)\u2032 = \u03c0\u03c4 (A)\u2032\u2032 and \u03c8|A = \u03c0\u03c4 (in particular, \u03c8 is an A-bimodule\nmap). Thus, the state \u03c6, given by \u03c6(x) = (\u03c8(x)\u03be\u03c4 , \u03be\u03c4 ) for x \u2208 B(H), is a desired\nA-central extension of \u03c4 .\nAd(ii)\u21d2(ii')\u21d2(i): The implication (ii)\u21d2(ii') follows from the definition of R\u03c9\nand the fact that Mn 's are isomorphic to subfactors of R for all n. Now assume\nQ\n(ii') and let \u03b8 and \u03b8b be asQin the condition. Since R is injective, \u03b8b extends\nto a\nQ\nucp map from B(H) into R. Composing this with the quotient map R \u2192 R\u03c9 ,\nwe obtain a ucp extension \u03c8 : B(H) \u2192 R\u03c9 of \u03b8. Since \u03c8 is an A-bimodule map,\nthe state \u03c6 given by \u03c6 = \u03c4\u03c9 \u03c8 is a desired A-central extension of \u03c4 .\n\u0003\nCorollary 6.2. Let M be a separable finite von Neumann algebra. Then M is\nQWEP if and only if M is \u2217-isomorphic to a von Neumann subalgebra of R\u03c9 .\nProof. Any von Neumann subalgebra of R\u03c9 is the range of a conditional expectation and a fortiori is QWEP. Now, assume that M is QWEP and let \u03c4 be a\nnormal faithful state on M. Let \u03c0 : C \u2217 F\u221e \u2192 M be a \u2217-homomorphism with a\nweak\u2217 -dense range. Since M is QWEP, by Corollary 3.18, the \u2217-homomorphism\n\u03c0 \u2297 \u03c0\u0304 : C \u2217 F\u221e \u2297min C \u2217 F\u221e \u2192 M \u2297max M\u0304 is continuous. It follows that Theorem 6.1\nis applicable to the trace \u03c4 \u03c0 on C \u2217 F\u221e ; there is a \u2217-homomorphism \u03b8 : C \u2217 F\u221e \u2192 R\u03c9\nsuch that \u03c4 \u03c0 = \u03c4\u03c9 \u03b8. This means that M is \u2217-isomorphic to the von Neumann\nsubalgebra generated by \u03b8(C \u2217 F\u221e ) in R\u03c9 .\n\u0003\n7. Groups with the Factorization Property\nOtherwise stated, all groups denoted by the symbol \u0393 are assumed countable\nand discrete.\nIf Connes' embedding problem has a negative answer, then it is quite natural\nto seek a counterexample in the group von Neumann algebras. It turns out [Ki3],\n[Ra2] that embeddability of L\u0393 into R\u03c9 is equivalent to that of \u0393 into the unitary\ngroup U(R\u03c9 ) of R\u03c9 . We say a group \u0393 is hyperlinear if it embeds into U(R\u03c9 ).\nProposition 7.1. A group \u0393 is hyperlinear if and only if L\u0393 is \u2217-isomorphic to a\nvon Neumann subalgebra of R\u03c9 .\nProof. One direction is obvious.QLet \u03b8 : \u0393 \u2192 U(R\u03c9 ) be an injective homomorphism\nand let \u0398 = (\u03b8n )n\u2208N : \u0393 \u2192 U( n\u2208N R) be any lift, i.e., \u03c0\u0398(s) = \u03b8(s) for s \u2208 \u0393.\nWe note that \u03b8n is asymptotically multiplicative, but no longer multiplicative.

It follows that for an appropriately chosen sequence k(n)\nof integers, the sequence of functions\n\u03c8n := \u03b8\u0303\u2297k(n) : \u0393 \u2192 U(M2 (R)\u2297k(n) ) \u223c\n= U(R)\nn\n\nis asymptotically multiplicative and limn\u2208\u03c9 \u03c4 \u03c8n (s) = 0 for all s \u2208 \u0393 with s 6= 1.\nThis means that for the homomorphism \u03c8 = lim \u03c8n , the von Neumann subalgebra\nof R\u03c9 generated by \u03c8(\u0393) is canonically \u2217-isomorphic to L\u0393.\n\u0003\nDefinition 7.2. We say a group \u0393 has the property (F) (the factorization property)\nif the trace \u03c4 on the full C \u2217 -algebra C \u2217 \u0393, defined by \u03c4 (s) = \u03b41,s for s \u2208 \u0393, is liftable.\nBy Theorem 6.1, a group \u0393 has the property (F) if and only if the representation\nX\nX\n\u03c3\u0393 : C \u2217 \u0393 \u2297 C \u2217 \u0393 \u220b\nak \u2297 bk 7\u2212\u2192\n\u03bb\u0393 (ak )\u03c1\u0393 (bk ) \u2208 B(l2 \u0393)\nk\n\nk\n\nis continuous w.r.t. the minimal tensor norm, where \u03bb\u0393 (reps. \u03c1\u0393 ) is the left (resp.\nright) regular representation of \u0393 on l2 \u0393. A group \u0393 with the property (F) is\nhyperlinear, and to the best of our knowledge, all groups known to be hyperlinear\nsatisfy the property (F). Let \u0393 be a hyperlinear group and let N be a normal\nsubgroup of F\u221e such that \u0393 = F\u221e /N. Then, because of the LLP of C \u2217 F\u221e , the\ntrace \u03c4\u0393 on C \u2217 F\u221e , given by the characteristic function of N, is liftable. Hence,\nthe study on permanence properties of liftable traces is more general than that of\nhyperlinearity.\nIf P is a property of groups (e.g. being finite) then a group \u0393 is said to be\nresidually P if, for any s \u2208 \u0393 with s 6= 1, there is a normal subgroup \u2206 in \u0393\nsuch that s \u2208\n/ \u2206 and \u0393/\u2206 satisfy P. When \u2206 is a subgroup of \u0393, the quotient\nhomogeneous space \u0393/\u2206 is said to be amenable if there is a \u0393-invariant mean on\nl\u221e (\u0393/\u2206). This is equivalent to the existence of a F\u00f8lner sequence in \u0393/\u2206 (see\n[Gl]). As it was observed by Wassermann [Wa] and Kirchberg [Ki3], residually\nfinite groups and in particular the free groups have the property (F). This also\nfollows from a more general result of Brown and Dykema [BD] that the property\n(F) is preserved under a free product (with amalgamation over a finite subgroup).\nProposition 7.3. A group \u0393 which is residually (F) has the property (F). In\nparticular, residually finite groups have the property (F).\nMoreover, the property (F) is preserved under taking a subgroup, a supergroup\nwith an amenable quotient, a direct product, an increasing union, and an amalgamated free product over a finite group.\nProof. The first assertion follows from the fact that the set of liftable traces is\nclosed in the pointwise topology. We only prove nontrivial claims in the second.\nThe claim on a supergroup follows from a ucp\nS analogue of induction. Let \u2206 \u2264 \u0393\nand fix a section \u03c3 : \u0393/\u2206 \u2192 \u0393 so that \u0393 = x\u2208\u0393/\u2206 \u03c3(x)\u2206.

Since \u03a6F coincides with the\ns \u2208 \u0393 \\ \u2206. Clealy, \u0393 acts on H\nrestriction of this unitary representation to the subspace generated by C\u03c3(F ) \u2297 H,\nit is ucp. Now, we assume that \u0393/\u2206 is amenable and \u2206 has the property (F). Then,\nthere is a sequence of ucp maps \u03c6n : C \u2217 \u2206 \u2192 Mk(n) such that lim trk(n) \u03c6n (s) = \u03b41,s\nand lim trk(n) (\u03c6n (s)\u2217 \u03c6n (s)) = 1 for all s \u2208 \u2206. It is not too hard to see that the\nsequence \u03a6Fnn on C \u2217 \u0393 satisfy the same conditions for a suitably chosen F\u00f8lner\nsequence Fn \u2282 \u0393/\u2206.\nWe turn to an amalgamated free product. Let Ai (i \u2208 I) be C \u2217 -algebras with a\ncommon finite dimensional C \u2217 -subalgebra B and let \u03c4i be liftable traces on Ai which\nagree on B. We have to show the free product trace \u03c4 on the full amalgamated\nfree product \u2217i\u2208I (Ai , B) is liftable. We may assume that I = {1, 2}. Since each\n\u03c4i is liftable, there is an asymptotically multiplicative and asymptotically trace\npreserving ucp map \u03c6i from Ai into a full matrix algebra Di . We claim that\n\u03c6i can be chosen exactly trace preserving and multiplicative on B. Indeed, by\namplifying the range Di if necessary, we may assume that there is a trace preserving\n\u2217-homomorphism \u03c0i : B \u2192 Di such that k\u03c6i (u) \u2212 \u03c0i (u)k2 \u2248 0 for u \u2208 U(B) (cf.\n[BD] for technical details). Note that U(B) is compact since B is finite dimensional.\nWe define a map \u03c6\u2032i : Ai \u2192 Di by\nZZ\n\u2032\n\u03c6i (a) =\n\u03c0i (u)\u03c6i(u\u2217 av)\u03c0i (v \u2217 ) du dv.\nU (B)\u00d7U (B)\n\nIt is not too hard to see that \u03c6\u2032i is a completely positive B-bimodule map. By\nour assumption, ei := 1 \u2212 \u03c6\u2032i (1) \u2208 \u03c0i (B)\u2032+ is close to zero in the 2-norm. Finally,\ntake a ucp extension \u03c0\u0303i : Ai \u2192 Di of \u03c0i and define a ucp map \u03c6\u2032\u2032i : Ai \u2192 Di by\n1/2\n1/2\n\u03c6\u2032\u2032i (a) = \u03c6\u2032i (a) + ei \u03c0\u0303i (a)ei for a \u2208 Ai . Then, \u03c6\u2032\u2032i is a small perturbation of \u03c6i\nand agrees with \u03c0i on B.\nLet A0i \u2282 Ai be the orthogonal complement of B w.r.t. the trace \u03c4i . By Boca's\ntheorem [Bo], the B-bimodule map \u03a6 : (A1 , B) \u2217 (A2 , B) \u2192 (D1 , B) \u2217 (D2 , B),\n6 in , is a\ndefined by \u03a6(a1 * * * an ) = \u03c6i1 (a1 ) * * * \u03c6in (an ) for ak \u2208 A0ik , i1 6= * * * =\nucp map between the full amalgamated products. Since each \u03c6i is asymptotically\ntrace preserving and asymptotically multiplicative, so is \u03a6. Thus, we reduced the\nproblem to the case where Ai are full matrix algebras Di . This case was proved by\nBrown and Dykema [BD]. Indeed, under this assumption, they showed that the\nreduced amalgamated free product is embeddable into an interpolated free group\n\n\f26\n\nNARUTAKA OZAWA\n\nfactor (and a fortiori into R\u03c9 ) and a \u2217-homomorphism from the full amalgamated\nfree product into R\u03c9 is ucp liftable.\n\u0003\nBrown suggested a possibility that all one-relator groups have the property (F).\nWe note that the Baumslag-Solitar groups BS(p, q) = ha, t | tap t\u22121 = aq i, which\nare typical examples of non-residually finite one-relator groups (at least for 1 < p <\nq), are hyperlinear [Ra2] and moreover have the property (F) since they are HNN\nextension of the cyclic group Z and hence embeddable in the semidirect products\nby Z of the increasing union of residually finite groups. However, it is not that\nall groups have the property (F). Indeed, infinite simple groups with Kazhdan's\nproperty (T) (for existence of such groups, see [Gr1]) do not have the property\n(F) as it was shown by Kirchberg [Ki3]. We refer the reader to de la Harpe and\nValette's book [HV] for Kazhdan's property (T). The following proof is close to\nthat of Kirchberg [Ki3], but uses an idea of Bekka [Wa].\nTheorem 7.4. Let \u03c4 be a trace on the full C \u2217 -algebra C \u2217 \u0393 of a group \u0393 with\nKazhdan's property (T). Then, \u03c4 is liftable if and only if there is a sequence of\n\u2217-homomorphisms \u03c0n : C \u2217 \u0393 \u2192 Mk(n) such that \u03c4 (a) = limn trk(n) \u03c0n (a).\nIn particular, a group \u0393 with the properties (F) and (T) is residually finite.\nb be a set of irreducible representations of \u0393 which contains exactly one\nProof. Let \u0393\nL\nrepresentation from each equivalence class. It follows\nthat\n\u0398\n=\nb \u03b8 is a faithful\n\u03b8\u2208\u0393\nL\nrepresentation of C \u2217 \u0393 on the Hilbert space H =\nH\u03b8 . We consider the faithful\nrepresentation (\u0398 \u2297 \u0398\u0304)\u221e of C \u2217 \u0393 \u2297min C \u2217 \u0393 on (H \u2297 H\u0304)\u221e . By the assumption, the\nstate \u03bc\u03c4 on C \u2217 \u0393 \u2297min C \u2217 \u0393 is continuous. Hence, it is approximated by a vector\nstates associated with a unit vector \u03ben \u2208 (H \u2297 H\u0304)\u221e . Since \u03bc\u03c4 (s \u2297 s\u0304) = 1 for all\ns \u2208 \u0393, the sequence of unit vectors {\u03ben } is almost invariant under (\u0398 \u2297 \u0398\u0304)\u221e (\u0393).\n(Here, we regard (\u0398\u2297 \u0398\u0304)\u221e as a representation of \u0393.) Hence, by Kazhdan's property\n(T), we may assume that \u03ben are actually invariant under (\u0398 \u2297 \u0398\u0304)\u221e (\u0393). The wellknown lemma of Schur states that for irreducible \u03b81 and \u03b82 , the representation\n\u03b81 \u2297 \u03b8\u03042 has a non-zero invariant vector if and only if \u03b81 and \u03b82 are equivalent\nand finite dimensional. Moreover, any invariant vector for \u03b8 \u2297 \u03b8\u0304 is a constant\n\u22121/2 P\nmultiple of \u03b7\u03b8 := d\u03b8\nk \u03b6k \u2297 \u03b6\u0304k , where {\u03b6k }k is an orthonormal basis of the\nd\u03b8 -dimensional Hilbert space H\u03b8 . It follows that we may assume that the vector\nstates associated with \u03ben is a convex combination (with rational coefficients) of\nthat of \u03b7\u03b8 's with finite dimensional \u03b8. We obtain the conclusion by observing that\n((\u0398(s) \u2297 1\u0304) \u03b7\u03b8 | \u03b7\u03b8 ) = trd\u03b8 \u03b8(s) for all s \u2208 \u0393.\n\u0003\nIt is unknown whether there exists a simple property (T) group \u0393 which is\nhyperlinear. By the above theorem, the full C \u2217 -algebra C \u2217 \u0393 of such a group \u0393\ncannot have the LLP. It is obvious that an inductive limit of hyperlinear groups\nis again hyperlinear. Since Gromov [Gr1] constructed infinite simple (T) groups\nas inductive limits (where connecting maps are surjective and not injective) of\n\n\fABOUT THE QWEP CONJECTURE\n\n27\n\nhyperbolic groups, it is particularly interesting to know whether all hyperbolic\ngroups are hyperlinear (or more generally satisfy the property (F)).\n8. Further Topics and Open Problems\nHaagerup and Winsl\u00f8w [HW1][HW2] studied the space vN(H) of all von Neumann algebras acting on a fixed separable Hilbert space H, equipped with the\nEffros-Mar\u00e9chal topology. Among other things, they proved that a II1 -factor\nM \u2208 vN(H) is embeddable into R\u03c9 if and only if it is approximated by finite\ndimensional factors in vN(H). They also gave a new proof of equivalence between\nthe conjectures.\nR\u0103dulescu [Ra1][Ra2] studied the space of the moments of noncommutative\nmonomials of degree p in a II1 -factor M and proved that it coincides with that for\nthe hyperfinite II1 -factor R when p \u2264 3. He also showed that the same assertion\nfor p = 4 is equivalent to the Connes' embedding problem.\nBrown [Br1][Br2] studied various approximation properties of traces on C \u2217 algebras and proved in particular that a separable II1 -factor (or any von Neumann\nalgebra) M \u2282 B(H) is embeddable into R\u03c9 (resp. QWEP) if and only if there are\na weak\u2217 -dense C \u2217 -algbera A in M and a ucp map \u03c6 : B(H) \u2192 M with \u03c6|A = idA .\nThere is a related result of Brown and Dykema [BD] on the (interpolated) free\ngroup factors LFs .\nThe following questions were raised by Kirchberg [Ki1].\nProblem. Is the QWEP conjecture true?\nProblem. Does there exist a non-nuclear C \u2217 -algebra with the WEP and the LLP?\nWhat Kirchberg found is very close to an example. He found an short exact\n\u2217\nF2 ) \u2192 0 with B \u2297min B op = B \u2297max B op .\nsequence 0 \u2192 K(l2 ) \u2192 B \u2192 cone(Cred\n\u2217\nBy Theorem 3.3, the C -algebra B has the WEP. Unfortunately, it is not known\nwhether B has the LLP. We remark that a C \u2217 -algebra with the WEP has the LLP\nif and only if it is os finitely representable in C \u2217 F\u221e (cf. [JP]). In the remarkable\n\u2217\npaper [HT],\nQ\nL Haagerup and Thorbj\u00f8rnsen proved that Cred F2 is embeddable into\nMn / Mn , which has to be weakly cp complemented (cf. the remarks at the\n\u2217\nend of section 4). Therefore, all quasidiagonal extensions of Cred\nF2 have the WEP.\nHowever, there are uncountably many mutually non-isomorphic such extensions,\namong which at most countably many can possibly have the LLP. (The precise\nstatement is that the set of all 3-dimensional operator subspaces in quasidiagonal\n\u2217\nextensions of Cred\nF2 is non-separable in the cb-distance topology (cf. [JP]).)\nProblem. Does there exist a non-nuclear exact C \u2217 -algebra with the LLP?\nExistence of such an example is in contradiction with the QWEP conjecture\nsince exact C \u2217 -algebras are locally reflexive [Ki2] and locally reflexive C \u2217 -algebras\nwith the WEP are necessarily nuclear [EH]. To the best of our knowledge, all\n\n\f28\n\nNARUTAKA OZAWA\n\nC \u2217 -algebras known to have the LLP are either nuclear or equivalent to C \u2217 F\u221e\nin the sense that they are (cp complemented) subquotients of each other. We\nnote that a C \u2217 -algebra A has both the exactness and the LLP if and only if\nA \u2297min (B(l2 )/K(l2 )) = A \u2297max (B(l2 )/K(l2 )).\nProblem. Does there exist a separable C \u2217 -algebra with the LLP, but not the LP?\nAgain, existence of such an example is in contradiction with the QWEP conjecture by Corollary 3.12. It seems that we have no example of a locally ucp liftable\nmap defined on a separable C \u2217 -algebra which does not have a global lifting.\nReferences\n[Ar1]\n[Ar2]\n[Be]\n[Bl]\n[BP]\n[Bo]\n[Br1]\n[Br2]\n[BD]\n[Ch1]\n[Ch2]\n[CE]\n[Co]\n[EH]\n[EJR]\n[ER1]\n[ER2]\n[Gl]\n[Gr1]\n\nW.
