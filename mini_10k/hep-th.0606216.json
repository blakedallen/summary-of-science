Discussion\n\n11\n\nA. Various homotopy groups\n\n12\n\n1. Introduction\nIn string theory there are several circumstances in which branes can terminate on other\nbranes. Strings can of course end on D-branes, and using S and T-duality one can show\nthat a Dp-brane can end on a D(p + 2)-brane, and that a Dp-brane with p \u2264 5 can\nend on an NS5-brane. These configurations were shown to be consistent with charge\nconservation by Strominger [1]. For a p-brane to end on a q-brane requires a coupling\nbetween the (p + 1)-form gauge field and the worldvolume gauge field on the q-brane.\nThis in turn implies that the end of the p-brane is charged under the worldvolume gauge\nfield on the q-brane. For example, a string can end on a Dp-brane because there is a\nterm \u2217F \u2227B in the expansion of the DBI action on the Dp-brane. This coupling implies\nthat the end of the string is charged electrically under the worldvolume gauge field.\nSimilarly, a Dp-brane can end on a D(p + 2)-brane because there is a term F \u2227 Cp+1 in\nCS action on the D(p + 2)-brane. This gives the (p \u2212 1)-dimensional end of the p-brane\na magnetic charge under the worldvolume gauge field in the D(p + 2)-brane. The full\n\n1\n\n\fCS action on a Dq-brane contains more terms coupling the worldvolume gauge field to\nall lower rank RR fields,\n1\nSCS = Cq+1 + Cq\u22121 \u2227 F + Cq\u22123 \u2227 F \u2227 F + * * * ,\n2\n\n(1.1)\n\nwhich suggests that any Dp-brane can end on a Dq-brane with p < q, as long as the\nend of the p-brane carries a charge of the form\nZ\nTr F \u2227 F \u2227 * * * \u2227 F .\n(1.2)\nS q\u2212p\n\nThese possibilities were mentioned briefly in [2]. However this requires a large enough\ngauge group such that the gauge bundle with the above Chern class is non-trivial, so\nwe need several coincident q-branes for the p-brane to end.\nCharge conservation is a necessary condition for these configurations to exist, but\nit isn't obviously sufficient. Even if they do exist, they may not be stable.1 Polchinski has recently provided an explicit construction for the case of a 1-brane ending on\n9-branes in Type I string theory, in terms of an effective tachyon field theory on a system of 9-branes and anti-9-branes [3].2 The basic ingredient is Sen's construction, and\nWitten's generalization, of Dp-branes as topological solitons in a higher-dimensional\nbrane-antibrane system [5, 6]. In particular the 1-brane in Type I string theory corresponds to a co-dimension eight tachyon configuration in the effective field theory of\neight 9-brane-anti-9-brane pairs, which asmptotically behaves as T (x) \u223c \u0393 * x. Adding\neight more 9-branes, Polchinski showed that the new system admits a tachyon configuration that describes a semi-infinite 1-brane, namely a configuration that reduces to\nthe above behavior on one side of the coordinate axis, and to zero on the other side.3\nThe obvious interpretation is that the 1-brane ends on the eight 9-branes that remain\nafter the tachyon condenses. This agrees with the requirement (1.2), since O(8) admits\na non-trivial bundle over S 8 .\nWe will generalize this construction to all the Dp-branes of Type I and Type IIB\nstring theory, and show that all the (stable) p-branes can end on 9-branes, provided\nthere are enough 9-branes. This will be in accord with the charge conservation condition\n(1.2). We will also show that the existence of a configuration where a p-brane ends on\n1\n\nExistence and stability are separate questions. For example, neutral non-BPS Dp-branes of the\n\"wrong\" dimension p exist in Type II string theory (p odd in Type IIA and even in Type IIB), but they\nare not stable. On the other hand neutral Dp-branes with the same p as the charged BPS D-branes\ndo not exist.\n2\nIn [4] Hirano and Hashimoto constructed a D8-brane with a D6-brane ending on it as a non-uniform\n8-brane soliton in unstable D9-branes in Type IIA string theory.\n3\nOther aspects of asymmetric brane-antibrane systems were studied in [7, 8].\n\n2\n\n\f9-branes is connected to the existence of a (p \u2212 1)-dimensional soliton in a Higgs phase\nof the 9-brane-anti-9-brane model, where the extra 9-branes are separated (by Wilson\nlines) from the brane-anti-brane pairs. This soliton sits at the boundary of the p-brane\nin the 9-brane, and carries the charge of (1.2). Interestingly we will find examples of\np-branes with both ends on 9-branes which are topologically stable.\nIn section 2 we will review Polchinski's construction, and generalize it to p-branes\nending on 9-branes in Type I and Type IIB string theory. In section 3 we will analyze\nthe Higgs phase of the brane-anti-brane model, and describe the end of the p-brane as\na (p \u2212 1)-dimensional topological soliton. Section 4 contains our discussion.\n\n2. Tachyon model\n2.1 Open Type I D1-brane\nIn [3] Polchinski constructed a tachyon configuration which describes a semi-infinite\nD1-brane in Type I string theory. He considered a sub-system of 16 9-branes and 8\nanti-9-branes, with a gauge group O(16) \u00d7 O(8). Since the tachyon is a bi-fundamental\nfield it can be thought of as a map from R8 to R16 . The vev of the tachyon, up to a\nmultiplicitive constant, is given by\n\u0014\n\u0015\nI8\u00d78\nT0 =\nmod O(16) ,\n(2.1)\n08\u00d78\nso it reduces to a map between the spheres\nT0 : S 7 \u2192 S 15 .\n\n(2.2)\n\nPolchinski then considers a tachyon configuration which asymptotically on an S 8 surrounding the origin is given by the third Hopf map\nT (\u03a9) : S 7 \u2192 S 15 \u2192 S 8 .\n\n(2.3)\n\nThe configuration is explicitly\nP\nr + 9i=1 \u03b3 i xi\nT (\u03a9) = p\nT0 ,\n2r(r + x9 )\n\nwhere \u03b3 i are the SO(9) gamma matrices. Near the positive x9 axis\n\u0014 \u0015\nI\nT \u223c\n= T0 ,\n0\n\n3\n\n(2.4)\n\n(2.5)\n\n\fwhich is the vacuum, and near the negative x9 axis\n\u0015\n\u0014\n0\n,\nT \u223c P8\ni i\ni=1 \u0393 x /|x|\n\n(2.6)\n\nwhere \u0393i are the SO(8) gamma matrices. This is precisely the asymptotic form of the\ntachyon for the D1-brane. The configuration (2.4) therefore describes a semi-infinite\nD1-brane, with an endpoint at x9 = 0.\nThe tachyon configuration is accompanied by a gauge field configuration in the\nunbroken O(8) gauge group such that\nZ\nTr F 4 = 1 .\n(2.7)\nS8\n\nNote however that the gauge bundle is classified by \u03c07 (O(8)) = Z \u2295 Z. There seem to\nbe two inequivalent charges that the endpoint of the 1-brane can carry. We will come\nback to this point and its implication at the end of section 3.\n2.2 other branes\nLet's try to extend Polchinski's construction to the other D-branes in Type I string\ntheory. The branes which might be able to end on 9-branes are D1, D5, D7 and D8.\nInterestingly there are exactly four Hopf maps,\n0th : S 0 \u2192 S 1 \u2192 S 1\n1st : S 1 \u2192 S 3 \u2192 S 2\n2nd : S 3 \u2192 S 7 \u2192 S 4\n\n(2.8)\n\n3rd : S 7 \u2192 S 15 \u2192 S 8 ,\nwhich naturally correspond to an open 8-brane, 7-brane, 5-brane and 1-brane, respectively. The construction is a simple generalization of the 1-brane case. We begin with\n2k 9-branes and k anti-9-branes, i.e. O(2k) \u00d7 O(k). The tachyon is therefore a map\nfrom Rk to R2k , and its vev reduces to a map from S k\u22121 to S 2k\u22121 . For k = 1, 2, 4 and\n8, there exists a nontrivial bundle\nS k\u22121 \u2192 S 2k\u22121 \u2192 S k ,\n\n(2.9)\n\nwhich can be used to construct the asymptotic form of the tachyon for an open (9 \u2212 k)brane,\nP\ni i\nr + k+1\ni=1 \u03b3 x\nT (\u03a9) = p\nT0 .\n(2.10)\n2r(r + xk+1 )\n4\n\n\fHowever this raises a couple of puzzles. The topological class of this bundle takes values\nin \u03c0k\u22121 (O(k)), where the k \u2212 1 refers to the base S k and the O(k) refers to the fiber\nS k\u22121 . In the four cases above,\n\u03c00 (O(1)) = Z2\n\n\u03c01 (O(2)) = Z \u03c03 (O(4)) = Z \u2295 Z \u03c07 (O(8)) = Z \u2295 Z .\n\n(2.11)\n\nThe problem is that, other than the k = 1 case, these homotopy groups do not agree\nwith the corresponding D-brane charges.\nIn fact the same problem shows up in the construction of the infinite Dp-branes as\ntachyonic solitons in a system with k 9-brane-anti-9-brane pairs. The resulting charges\ntake values in precisely the groups shown in (2.11). In that case we know that in order\nto get reliable answers we need to take a larger number N of brane-antibrane pairs,\nso that the homotopy groups are stable. This follows from the correct identification of\nD-brane charge in K-theory [6].\nWe propose that the same is true here. With N + k 9-branes and N anti-9-branes\nthe tachyon vev defines a map\nS N \u22121 \u2192 S N +k\u22121 .\n\n(2.12)\n\nIn general S N +k\u22121 cannot be obtained by fibring S N \u22121 over S k . This is only true for\nthe four Hopf maps (2.8). But a more general class of sphere bundles exists\nS N \u22121 \u2192 M N +k\u22121 \u2192 S k ,\n\n(2.13)\n\nwhere the total space M N +k\u22121 is not in general a sphere. These bundles are classified by\n\u03c0k\u22121 (O(N)), and therefore agree precisely, for large N, with the D-brane charges. The\nnon-triviality of the bundle shows that a p-brane can only end on precisely k = 9 \u2212 p\n9-branes.\nWe do not have an explicit expression for the asymptotic form of the tachyon in\nthis more general case, but we can suggest a possible way to construct the map (2.12).\nStart with the inclusion map of the bundle S N \u22121 \u2192 M N \u2212k\u22121 , and then construct\na map M N \u2212k\u22121 \u2192 S N \u2212k\u22121 by mapping the neighborhood of a point in M N \u2212k\u22121 to\nS N \u2212k\u22121 \u2212 {0}, and the complement of the neighborhood to {0}. The tachyon is the\ncomposite map of these two maps.4\n2.3 Type IIB\nIn Type IIB string theory we expect to see 1-branes, 3-branes, 5-branes and 7-branes\nending on 9-branes. Starting again with 2k 9-branes and k anti-9-branes, the gauge\n4\n\nWe thank Edward Witten for suggesting this to us.\n\n5\n\n\fgroup is U(2k) \u00d7 U(k), and the tachyon vev defines a map from S 2k\u22121 to S 4k\u22121 . There\nare now three Hopf maps\nS 2k\u22121 \u2192 S 4k\u22121 \u2192 S 2k ,\n\n(2.14)\n\nwith k = 1, 2 and 4. This gives correspondingly an open 7-brane, 5-brane and 1-brane.\nThe charges come out right in these cases since the groups \u03c02k\u22121 (U(k)) = Z are stable,\nand we don't need to add more 9-brane-anti-9-brane pairs. On the other hand there\nis no Hopf map for the 3-brane. We are therefore forced to consider the more general\nclass of unitary sphere bundles. In particular the open 3-brane can be constructed as\nS 5 \u2192 M 11 \u2192 S 6 .\n\n(2.15)\n\nMore generally, a configuration of N + k 9-branes and N anti-9-branes will give rise to\nan open (9 \u2212 2k)-brane as the bundle\nS 2N \u22121 \u2192 M 2(N +k)\u22121 \u2192 S 2k .\n\n(2.16)\n\nThese bundles are classified by \u03c02k\u22121 (U(N)) = Z, which agrees with the D-brane\ncharges.\n\n3. Higgs-Tachyon model\nLet us now go back to the description of D-branes as topological solitons in a system\nwith an equal number of 9-branes and anti-9-branes, and consider the effect of adding\nextra 9-branes. For N brane-antibrane pairs the effective field theory has a gauge group\nGN \u00d7 GN , where GN is either O(N), U(N) or Sp(N), depending on the theory, and\na bi-fundamental tachyon field. The lower dimensional p-branes are classified by the\nhomotopy groups of the tachyon vacuum manifold \u03c08\u2212p ((GN \u00d7 GN )/GN ) = \u03c08\u2212p (GN ).\nFor U(N) this gives all the odd p BPS D-branes of Type IIB, and for O(N) it gives the\nBPS 1-brane and 5-brane, and the stable non-BPS 0-brane, 7-brane, and 8-brane. The\nSp(N) case corresponds to the other orientifold projection of Type IIB [9], in which\ncase we get a BPS 1-brane and 5-brane, and a stable non-BPS 3-brane and 4-brane.\nWith k extra 9-branes the gauge group is GN +k \u00d7 GN , and the subgroup which is\nleft unbroken by the tachyon is Gk \u00d7 GN . The resulting vacuum manifold GN +k /Gk\nsatisfies (see the appendix)\n\u03c08\u2212p (GN +k /Gk ) = 0\n\n(3.1)\n\nfor p > 8 \u2212 d, where d = k, 2k + 1 and 4k + 3 in the O, U and Sp cases, respectively.\nIt therefore appears that the p-branes become topologically unstable one-by-one as we\n\n6\n\n\fincrease k. For each p-brane there is a critical number of excess 9-branes k at which it\nloses its topological charge. For example the soliton describing the D1-brane in Type\nI string theory becomes topologically unstable when k = 8.5 This is precisely the\nnumber of extra 9-branes that were needed for the construction of the semi-infinite\n1-brane in the previous section. In fact the smallest value of k for any p-brane soliton\nto become topologically unstable is the same as that needed for the construction of the\nsemi-infinite p-brane. This suggests that the p-brane becomes topologically unstable\nas a soliton because it can break open on the 9-branes. As we will now show, this is\nrelated to the existence of a (p \u2212 1)-dimensional soliton.\n3.1 a simple field theory example\nConsider a four-dimensional SU(2) gauge theory with two scalar fields, a triplet and a\ndoublet. Assume that both have a nonzero vev, and that the triplet vev is larger than\nthe doublet vev. The gauge symmetry is broken in two stages:\nSU(2) \u2192 U(1) \u2192 0 .\n\n(3.2)\n\nThe second stage by itself is the Abelian Higgs model, which admits a Nielsen-Olesen\nstring soliton with charge in \u03c01 (U(1)) = Z. This string confines the magnetic flux\nof the broken U(1). The first stage is the 'tHooft-Polyakov model, which gives rise\nto a magnetic monopole with charge in \u03c02 (SU(2)/U(1)) = Z. The full theory has\nno topologically stable solitons since \u03c01 (SU(2)) = \u03c02 (SU(2)) = 0. The magnetic\nflux of the monopole from stage 1 gets confined into a semi-infinite string in stage 2.\nAlternatively, the string from stage 2 can break by the creation of a monopole-antimonopole pair in stage 1. Either way we see that the loss of topological charge is\nexplained by the configuration of a string ending on a monopole.\n3.2 Type II\nThe simple field theory example above illustrates our strategy for the brane-anti-brane\nsystem. We first separate the extra branes from the brane-antibrane pairs by turning\non a vev for the appropriate adjoint scalars, and then let the tachyon condense.6 We\nwill call the first stage the \"Higgs stage\", and the second the \"tachyon stage\". In the\nType IIB 9-brane-anti-9-brane system this gives\nU(N + k) \u00d7 U(N) \u2192 U(k) \u00d7 U(N) \u00d7 U(N) \u2192 U(k) \u00d7 U(N) .\n5\n\n(3.3)\n\nOf course the tadpole condition fixes k = 32 in Type I so none of the solitons are topologically\nstable [10], but the statement is still correct.\n6\nSince we are using 9-branes we can't really separate them, but we can compactify them and turn\non Wilson lines. This is T-dual to separating lower-dimensional branes.\n\n7\n\n\fThe vacuum manifold of the full theory is given by\nMk =\n\nU(N + k)\n,\nU(k)\n\n(3.4)\n\nwhich has trivial homotopy groups \u03c08\u2212p (Mk ) = 0 for p \u2265 8\u22122k. The vacuum manifolds\nof the Higgs and tachyon stage are given by\nU(N + k)\nU(k) \u00d7 U(N)\nT\nMk = U(N) .\n\nMH\nk =\n\n(3.5)\n(3.6)\n\nThe homotopy groups of the three manifolds above have different physical meanings.\nWe already saw that \u03c08\u2212p (Mk ) classifies p-dimensional solitons in the full theory. The\ngroup \u03c08\u2212p (MTk ) classifies p-dimensional solitons in the tachyon stage, which is the\nbrane-antibrane annihilation stage. These are precisely the p-branes. Finally, the\ngroup \u03c09\u2212p (MH\nk ) classifies (p \u2212 1)-dimensional solitons in the Higgs stage. In the\nsimple example above we saw that the existence of a pointlike soliton in the first stage\nis what allowed the string-like soliton of the second stage to break. We shall therefore\nrefer to the solitons in the Higgs stage as end-solitons. In general a p-brane will be\nable to break if there exists at least one matching (p \u2212 1)-dimensional end-soliton in\nthe Higgs stage.\nThe homotopy groups of the three manifolds form an exact sequence given by\nj\u2217\n\n\u2202\u2217\n\ni\u2217\n\nT\n* * * \u2192 \u03c09\u2212p (Mk ) \u2192 \u03c09\u2212p (MH\nk ) \u2192 \u03c08\u2212p (Mk ) \u2192 \u03c08\u2212p (Mk ) \u2192 * * * .\n\n(3.7)\n\nThis implies that when \u03c08\u2212p (Mk ) = 0 the map\n\u2202\u2217\n\nT\n\u03c09\u2212p (MH\nk ) \u2192 \u03c08\u2212p (Mk )\n\n(3.8)\n\nis onto (surjective), because Im \u2202\u2217 = Ker i\u2217 = \u03c08\u2212p (MTk ). In other words there is at\nleast one end-soliton for each p-brane with p \u2265 8 \u2212 2k. Therefore the p-brane can break\nprecisely when it is no longer stable as a soliton in the full theory, which is what we\nwanted to demonstrate.\nSince there are only odd-dimensional stable p-branes in Type IIB to begin with,\nthe smallest p-brane that can break has p = 9 \u2212 2k. For p \u2265 9 \u2212 2k the exact\nsequence actually shows that the map (3.8) is an isomorphism, since in this case both\n\u03c08\u2212p (Mk ) = \u03c09\u2212p (Mk ) = 0. This means there is only one possible end-soliton for each\np-brane. This will not be the case in Type I.\n\n8\n\n\fFigure 1: A p-brane breaking on (p + 2)-branes from the spacetime and worldvolume points\nof view. On top an 'tHooft-Polyakov monopole forms when we separate the brane-antibrane\npair from the extra brane. On the bottom the magnetic flux on the brane-antibrane is confined\nto a semi-infinite p-brane after the tachyon condenses.\n\nThe (p \u2212 1)-dimensional end-soliton has the correct charge in the unbroken gauge\ngroup U(k) to satisfy the condition of section 2,\nZ\n\nTr F (9\u2212p)/2 \u2208 \u03c08\u2212p (U(k)) = Z for p \u2265 9 \u2212 2k .\n\n(3.9)\n\nS 9\u2212p\n\nAs a consistency check we note that the gauge charge is identical to the topological\ncharge of the end-soliton in \u03c09\u2212p (MH\nk ) thanks to identity (A.12). Figure 1 shows a\n7-brane breaking on a 9-brane (or a 1-brane on a 3-brane).\n\n3.3 Type I\nApplying the same strategy in Type I string theory, we break the 9-brane-anti-9-brane\ngauge symmetry in two stages by first separating the extra 9-branes (turning on the\nappropriate Wilson line), and then letting the tachyon condense,\nO(N + k) \u00d7 O(N) \u2192 O(k) \u00d7 O(N) \u00d7 O(N) \u2192 O(k) \u00d7 O(N) .\n\n9\n\n(3.10)\n\n\fThe three vacuum manifolds in this case are given by\nO(N + k)\nO(k)\nO(N + k)\nMH\nk =\nO(k) \u00d7 O(N)\nT\nMk = O(N) .\nMk =\n\n(3.11)\n(3.12)\n(3.13)\n\nThe solitons of the full theory are classified by \u03c08\u2212p (Mk ), which in this case vanishes\nfor p \u2265 9 \u2212 k. We therefore expect the 8-brane to first break when k = 1, the 7-brane\nwhen k = 2, the 5-brane when k = 4, and the 1-brane when k = 8. This is confirmed,\nexactly as in the Type IIB case, by looking at the exact homotopy sequence (3.7).\nT\nWhen \u03c08\u2212p (Mk ) = 0, the map \u03c09\u2212p (MH\nk ) \u2192 \u03c08\u2212p (Mk ) is onto, and therefore each\np-brane with p \u2265 9 \u2212 k has at least one end-soliton associated to it.\nFor p \u2265 10 \u2212 k the map is an isomorphism, so there is exactly one end-soliton for\neach p-brane. However now the smallest p-brane that can break has p = 9 \u2212 k, for\nwhich the map is onto, but not one-to-one. The end-solitons in these cases are not in\none-to-one correspondence with the p-branes.\nThis can have an interesting effect. Consider a finite open p-brane with two ends.\nIf the group of end-solitons is isomorphic to the group of p-branes, the two ends carry\nopposite charges and the configuration is unstable. However if the two groups are not\nisomorphic, it should be possible to have an open p-brane with ends whose charges do\nnot sum up to zero. Let's look at each of the four p-branes in turn.\n1-brane : For the 1-brane with k = 8 the particle-like end-solitons are classified by\n\u03c08 (MH\n8 ) = Z \u2295Z,\n\n(3.14)\n\nwhereas the 1-brane itself is in \u03c07 (MT8 ) = Z. There are two inequivalent types of\nend-solitons. Therefore an open 1-brane with one end on one type of soliton, and the\nother end on the other type of (anti-) soliton should be stable. Indeed, the full theory\ncontains a stable particle-like soliton in this case, since\n\u03c08 (M8 ) = Z .\n\n(3.15)\n\n5-brane: The 5-brane with k = 4 can likewise break in two inequivalent ways, since\n\u03c04 (MH\n4 ) = Z \u2295 Z. This leads to a stable 4-dimensional soliton, as can be seen from\n\u03c04 (M4 ) = Z.\n7-brane: For the 7-brane with k = 2 the possible end-solitons are classified by\n\u03c02 (MH\n2 ) = Z,\n\n10\n\n(3.16)\n\n\fwhereas the 7-brane is in \u03c01 (MT2 ) = Z2 . In this case there is a single type of endsoliton, but since the 7-brane does not have an orientation (it is its own antibrane)\nthe two endpoints can be charged equally or oppositely. In the former case the object\nshould be stable. This is confirmed by the existence of a stable 6-dimensional soliton\nin\n\u03c02 (M2 ) = Z .\n\n(3.17)\n\nFurthermore, from the part of the exact sequence\nT\n\u03c02 (M2 ) \u2192 \u03c02 (MH\n2 ) \u2192 \u03c01 (M2 )\nZ\n\u2192\nZ\n\u2192\nZ2\n\n(3.18)\n\nwe see that the basic soliton carries two units of end-soliton charge.\n8-brane: In the case of the 8-brane with k = 1 the end-solitons carry a Z2 charge, and\nare therefore in one-to-one correspondence with the 8-brane. Correspondingly, there is\nno stable 7-dimensional soliton in the full theory.\nFinally, as in the Type II case, the end-solitons also carry the required charges in\nthe unbroken O(k)\nZ\nTr F (9\u2212p)/2 \u2208 \u03c08\u2212p (O(k)) ,\n(3.19)\nS 9\u2212p\n\n7\nwhich agree with their topological charge in \u03c09\u2212p (MH\nk ) thanks to (A.12).\n\n4. Discussion\nWe have given two descriptions of p-branes ending on 9-branes. The two descriptions\nagree on the conditions for branes to end, but they are valid in different regimes. In\nthe tachyon model all the 9-branes and anti-9-branes coincide (no Wilson line), so the\nbroken p-brane is inside the branes it ends on. In the Higgs-Tachyon model we first\nbreak the symmetry by separating the extra 9-branes from the brane-anti-brane pairs,\nand then let the tachyon condense. The p-brane forms at the location of the pairs,\nand breaks by connecting to a p-brane which stretches between the pairs and the extra\n9-branes (Fig. 1). The former is the p-dimensional soliton formed in the tachyon stage,\nand the latter is the (p \u2212 1)-dimensional end-soliton formed in the Higgs stage.\n7\n\nWe are assuming here that there is a proper generalization of the RR charge conservation argument\nwhich led to (1.2) for the case of the Type I 7-brane and 8-brane, whose RR fields exist only as torsion\nin K-theory. It would be interesting to formulate this in a precise manner.\n\n11\n\n\fAn interesting question is whether we can connect the two descriptions by gradually\nreducing the Higgs vev (or really the Wilson line in the 9-brane case), i.e. the separation\nbetween the brane-anti-brane pairs and the extra 9-branes. As we reduce the Higgs vev\nthe core of the end-soliton grows, until it fills all of space, at which point the full gauge\ngroup GN +k \u00d7 GN would be unbroken everywhere. This clearly does not fit with the\nfirst description, in which the gauge group is broken to Gk \u00d7 GN almost everywhere.\nFurthermore, the semi-infinite part of the p-brane carries different fluxes in the two\ndescriptions. In the Higgs-Tachyon model the p-brane carries the magnetic flux of the\ngauge group which is broken in the tachyon stage, whereas in the tachyon model it\ncarries the unbroken flux. Apparently a phase transition must occur between the two\ndescriptions.\nWe found three examples of topologically stable open p-branes in 9-branes with\northogonal groups: a 1-brane in eight 9-branes, a 5-brane in four 9-branes, and a 7brane in two 9-branes. In these cases there are more types of end-solitons than p-branes,\nwhich allows the sum of the two charges at the ends to be non-zero. Of course tadpole\ncancellation requires an excess of exactly 32 9-branes, so these states aren't really stable\nin Type I string theory. One could break the SO(32) symmetry with additional Wilson\nlines and obtain states which would be stable in some energy range. Alternatively\none could imagine (via T-duality for example) lower-dimensional orientifold planes, in\nwhich these states would be stable.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe wish to thank Joe Polchinski for patiently explaining his results, and for the initial\ncorrespondence which led to this project.
