In particular, it has been\ndemonstrated that the spontaneous emission rate of an atom inside the cavity is different\nfrom its value in free space [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. This effect can be\ndiscussed from several different approaches, and here it will be basically attributed to a\nchange of the spectral density of the modes of the vacuum electromagnetic field, which is\ndue to the cavity resonating structure [13]. This approach is particularly convenient when\nthe cavity does not have one single high-finesse mode, but rather many nearly degenerate\nmodes, as it is the case in confocal or spherical cavities. More precisely, we will show that a\n\"wide aperture\" concentric resonator using spherical mirrors with a large numerical aperture,\ncan in principle change significantly the spontaneous emission rate of an atom sitting close\nto the cavity center, even with moderate finesse. Similar result were already demonstrated,\nusing either a spherical cavity [7, 11, 13] or \"hour-glass\" modes in a confocal cavity [12].\nIn such experiments, the atom has to sit within the active region volume, which is usually\nof very small size (of order (10\u03bb)3 to (100\u03bb)3 ). In refs [11, 12], a possible solution was\nimplemented by using a narrow atomic beam, and by reducing the cavity finesse in order to\nhave an extended area in which a spherical wave is \"self-imaged\" on itself. However, getting\nlarge effects will put more severe constraints both on the quality of the cavity and on the\nlocalisation of the atoms. A different way to implement the proposed scheme in a spherical\ncavity, that we would like to discuss in more detail here, is to use light-induced forces in\norder to attract the atom to the cavity center. A possible implementation could be to couple\na light beam inside the cavity, and then to use the dipole force to hold the atoms in the\nright position, i.e., close to the cavity center. The effect of strong atom-cavity coupling on\nthe dipole force has been studied theoretically [14, 21], and very interesting effects can be\nexpected : since the atomic relaxation will be modified by the cavity, the balance between\nthe trapping and heating effects of the dipole trap will be changed with respect to free space,\nwhich could result in an improvement of the trap itself.\nA good understanding of these effects requires first to know the full space dependence\nof the cavity-induced damping and level shifts. In this letter, we will look at the situation\n2\n\n\fwhere the atom lies close to the center of a spherical cavity with a large numerical aperture.\nWe will show that large changes both in the atom damping rate and in its energy levels can\nbe expected, even with a moderate cavity finesse, provided that the atom sits (relatively,\nbut not extremely) close to the cavity center [13]. Moreover, we will show that for a weak\nexcitating field, the atom can be trapped by vacuum-induced light shifts [15, 16], which\ncreate a force whose spatial dependence is related to the shape of the mode spectral density.\nIn the following, we will assume that the cavity damping rate \u03ba is much larger than the\nfree-space atom damping rate \u0393vac . In that case, the cavity still acts as a continuum with\nrespect to the atomic relaxation. This will allow us to treat simply the atom-field coupling\nusing frequency- dependant coupling coefficients. For simplicity, we will also assume a weak\nexcitation of the atom. This assumption is however not crucial, and possible extensions will\nbe discussed at the end of the paper.\n\nII.\n\nLIGHT-INDUCED FORCES IN THE CAVITY QED REGIME\n\nLet us consider a neutral, slowly moving two-level atom in the dipole approximation. The\nHamiltonian describing the atom-light coupling is :\nH = Hf + Ha \u2212 D.E(r)\n\n(1)\n\nwhere D is the atom dipole moment and E is the electric field. The free field and atom\nhamiltonians are respectively Hf =\n\nP\n\nk\n\nh\u0304\u03c9k (nk + 1/2) and Ha = p2 /(2m) + h\u0304\u03c9o S (z) . Here, r\n\nand p are the atom's position and momentum, m is its mass, and the dipole operator can be\nwritten D = d(ei\u03c9L t S (+) +e\u2212i\u03c9L t S (\u2212) ), where S (+) and S (\u2212) are the usual two-level rising and\nlowering operators in the frame rotating at the angular frequency \u03c9L of an externally applied\nlaser (we have S (z) = (S (+) S (\u2212) \u2212 S (\u2212) S (+) )/2). The electric field operator is expanded as\nusual on a basis of orthogonal modes, but we do not specify that these modes should be\nplane waves. One has therefore :\nE(r, t) = i\n\nX\n\nek (r) ak (t) e\u2212i\u03c9k t + h.c.\n\n(2)\n\nk\n\nwhere k is a mode label which include polarization, and ek (r) is the contribution of mode\nk to the field at point r close to the cavity center. It will be convenient to refer optical\nfrequencies to a reference \u03c9L , which can be the frequency of an externally applied laser as\n3\n\n\fsaid above, and to define :\nA(r, t) = i\n\nX\n\nek (r) ak (t) e\u2212i(\u03c9k \u2212\u03c9L )t\n\n(3)\n\nk\n\nso that :\nE(r, t) = A(r, t)e\u2212i\u03c9L t + A\u2020 (r, t)ei\u03c9L t .\n\n(4)\n\nMoving to a frame rotating at the frequency \u03c9L and using the rotating wave approximation, the interaction part of the Hamiltonian can be written :\nHint = \u2212S (+) d.A \u2212 d.A\u2020 S (\u2212)\n\n(5)\n\nFrom the expression of the hamiltonian one can simply get the force acting on the atom[19] :\nF(r, t) =\n\ndp\n= \u2212\u2207H = \u2207(S (+) (t) d.A(r, t)) + h.c.\ndt\n\n(6)\n\nIn this expression, the only space-dependant part is ek (r), so the force can also be written :\nF(r, t) = i S (+) (t)\n\nX\nk\n\n\u2207[ d.ek (r)] ak (t) e\u2212i(\u03c9k \u2212\u03c9L )t + h.c.\n\n(7)\n\nFrom the Hamiltonian, one gets the Heisenberg equations for the field operators ak [17],\nwhich can be integrated formally, yielding (d.ek is taken real) :\nd.ek Z t\u2212t0\nd\u03c4 S (\u2212) (t \u2212 \u03c4 )ei(\u03c9k \u2212\u03c9L )(t\u2212\u03c4 )\nak (t) = ak (t0 ) +\nh\u0304 0\n\n(8)\n\nUsing this result in the definition of the fields operators, one sees that the field splits in two\nparts E = Eo + Es , where Eo and Es are the well-known \"vacuum field\" and \"source field\"\nterms, which do not commute [17]. Similarly, the expression of the force splits in two parts :\nF = Fo + Fs\n\n(9)\n\nBy choosing the normal ordering when separating the two non-commuting terms, the first\npart Fo gives the usual expression of the light-induced force [19]. The second term Fs is\nzero in the absence of a cavity, because the gradient of the source field is zero at the dipole\nplace. However, as we will show now, this is no longer true inside a cavity. Still assuming\nnormal ordering, one gets :\nFs =\n\nX\nk\n\n= \u2207\n\ni \u2207 [d.ek (r)] d.ek (r)\nh\u0304\n\n\"\nX\nk\n\ni (d.ek (r))2\n2h\u0304\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nZ\n\nt\u2212t0\n\n0\n\nt\u2212t0\n\nd\u03c4 S\n\nd\u03c4 S (+) (t)S (\u2212) (t \u2212 \u03c4 ) e\u2212i(\u03c9k \u2212\u03c9L )\u03c4 + h.c.\n\n(+)\n\n4\n\n(t)S\n\n(\u2212)\n\n\u2212i(\u03c9k \u2212\u03c9L )\u03c4\n\n(t \u2212 \u03c4 ) e\n\n#\n\n+ h.c.\n\n(10)\n\n\fIn order to get the physical meaning of this integral, let us write the Heisenberg equation\nfor S (\u2212) and use the expression of ak in order to get :\nX (d.ek )2\ndS (\u2212)\nd.Ao\n= i\u03b4L S (\u2212) \u2212 2iS (z)\n+2\ndt\nh\u0304\nh\u03042\nk\n\nZ\n\nt\u2212t0\n\n0\n\nd\u03c4 S (z) (t)S (\u2212) (t \u2212 \u03c4 )e\u2212i(\u03c9k \u2212\u03c9L )\u03c4 ,\n\n(11)\n\nwhere \u03b4L = \u03c9L \u2212\u03c9o . The integral appearing here has the same structure as the one appearing\nin eq. 10 under the gradient, and corresponds to the well known relaxation and light shift\nterms in the evolution of the dipole components. It can be calculated as usual using a\nMarkov approximation [17], which is possible here because as said above we assumed that the\ncavity features are wide compared to the free-space relaxation rate of the atom. In the weak\nexcitation limit, which is assumed here, one can approximate the evolution of the correlation\nfunctions by their free evolution during the short memory time of the reservoir. Note that\nan extension should be made to the strong excitation regime by considering relaxation in a\ndressed state basis [20]. Making the approximation S (\u2212) (t \u2212 \u03c4 ) = S (\u2212) (t) e\u2212i(\u03c9L \u2212\u03c90 )\u03c4 during\nthe correlation time [17], one can define the quantities :\nX\nk\n\n(d.ek (r))2\nh\u03042\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nt\u2212t0\n\n1\n(d.ek (r))2\n\u03c0\u03b4(\u03c9k \u2212 \u03c9o ) + iP\n2\n\u03c9k \u2212 \u03c9o\nh\u0304\nk\n= \u0393(r)/2 + i\u2206(r)\n\nd\u03c4 e\u2212i(\u03c9k \u2212\u03c9o )\u03c4 =\n\n\u0012\n\nX\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\u0013\n\n(12)\n\nwhere one has therefore :\n\u0393(r) =\n\u2206(r) =\n\n2\u03c0 X\n(d.ek (r))2 \u03b4(\u03c9k \u2212 \u03c9o )\nh\u03042 k\nX\nk\n\n1\n(d.ek (r))2\nP\n2\n\u03c9k \u2212 \u03c9o\nh\u0304\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(13)\n(14)\n\nUsing these definitions and S (z) S (\u2212) = \u2212S (\u2212) /2, eq. 11 becomes as expected\n\u0393(r) (\u2212)\nd.Ao\ndS (\u2212)\n= (i\u03b4L \u2212 i\u2206(r) \u2212\n) S \u2212 2iS (z)\ndt\n2\nh\u0304\n\n(15)\n\nso that the atomic frequency \u03c90 becomes \u03c90 + \u2206(r). We note that the free-space value of\n\u2206(r) is a diverging quantity, which is usually assumed to be absorbed in the definition of\nthe atomic levels; therefore, one considers here only the (finite) change of \u2206(r) with respect\nto this free-space value, that will be denoted \u2206\u2032 (r) :\n\u2206\u2032 (r) = \u2206cav (r) \u2212 \u2206vac (r)\n5\n\n(16)\n\n\fIn the expression of the extra term in the force, one can use either \u2206\u2032 (r) or \u2206cav (r), since\nthe gradient of \u2206vac (r) is zero anyway, and one obtains finally :\n\u0010\n\nFs = h\u0304/2 S (+) S (\u2212) \u2207(\u2212\u2206\u2032 (r) + i\u0393(r)/2) + \u2207(\u2212\u2206\u2032 (r) \u2212 i\u0393(r)/2) S (+) S (\u2212)\n= \u2212 \u2207(h\u0304 \u2206\u2032 (r)) \u03a0e\n\n\u0011\n\n(17)\n\nwhere \u03a0e = S (+) S (\u2212) = S (z) + 1/2 is the excited state population. Therefore the gradient\nof the cavity-induced light shift creates a force, which can attract the atom towards the\ncavity center for an appropriate choice of the atom-cavity detuning. Physically, it makes\nsense that Fs is also proportionnal to the excited level population. In order to characterize\nmore precisely the behaviour of this force, one needs now the explicit space dependence of\n\u2206\u2032 (r). The same calculation will also give the space-dependent damping \u0393(r)/2, which will\nbe useful for calculating the steady state and evolution of the atomic operators.\n\nIII.\n\nCAVITY-INDUCED RELAXATION RATES AND LIGHT SHIFTS\n\nFor definiteness, we will consider the case of a spherical cavity of radius R and of reflectivity and transmittivity coefficients \u03c1 and \u03c4 , with \u03c12 + \u03c4 2 = 1, and \u03c4 2 = T . We will assume\nthat kR \u226b 1 (typically kR = 105 ), and a moderate cavity finesse (in the range 10-100). A\ncrucial parameter is the solid angle subtended by the cavity, that will be denoted \u2206\u03a9cav .\nFor instance, a cavity half-aperture angle of 45 degrees gives\n\u2206\u03a9vac\n4\u03c0\n\n\u2206\u03a9cav\n4\u03c0\n\n= 0.3, and therefore\n\n= 0.7 as the fraction of space still occupied by vacuum modes. All parameters quoted\n\nabove seem accessible from an experimental point of view, and we will show now that they\nallow one to get quite significant cavity-induced effects.\nIn order to calculate the explicit space and frequency dependence of the relaxation rate\nand level shift, we have followed two parallel approaches, which are described in detail in\nanother publication [13]. The first one is to solve explicitly the field equations in a spherical\ngeometry, taking into account the considerable simplifications which appear since we are\n\u2212\ninterested in the field at distances smaller than \u223c 100\u03bb\noff the origin. In geometric optics\n\n\u2212\nthis involves light-rays with an impact parameter smaller than 100\u03bb\n, and therefore, in the\n\nmultipole expansion of the field, it will be sufficient to consider harmonics up to order\nl \u2264 100. Actually, up to 300 harmonics have be used in order to check consistency. Another\nvery important point is that the continuity equations of the fields on the mirrors must be\n6\n\n\fexpressed at a distance R \u2243 1 cm. With \u03bb = 780 nm, this corresponds to kR \u2243 80000, which\nis quite large, and allows one to use asymptotic forms of the solutions on the mirrors. Under\nthese assumptions, it can be shown that the expression of \u2206\u2032 (r) and \u0393(r)/2 can be given an\nexplicit operatorial form in the space of mode functions, and then evaluated numerically in\na spherical harmonics basis [13].\nBesides this \"exact\" calculation, we have also looked for an approximate solution, inspired\nby ray-optics considerations, and eventually checked by comparison with the complete numerical calculation. Using this cross-checking method, we obtain finally that the effect of\nthe cavity can be described to a very good approximation by the following formulas:\n\u0393(r)\n=\n\u0393vac\n\nZ\n\nd.\u03a9\u0302 2\nT\nT\nd\u03a9\u0302 3\n2\n(1 \u2212 (\n) )(\ncos\n(k\n\u03a9\u0302.r)\n+\nsin2 (k \u03a9\u0302.r))\n4\u03c0 2\nd\n| 1 \u2212 \u03c1e2i\u03c6 |2\n| 1 + \u03c1e2i\u03c6 |2\n\n(18)\n\n\u2206\u2032 (r)\n=\n\u0393vac\n\nZ\n\nd.\u03a9\u0302 2 \u03c1 sin(2\u03c6)\n\u03c1 sin(2\u03c6)\nd\u03a9\u0302 3\n(1 \u2212 (\n) )(\ncos2 (k \u03a9\u0302.r) \u2212\nsin2 (k \u03a9\u0302.r))\n2i\u03c6\n2\n4\u03c0 2\nd\n| 1 \u2212 \u03c1e |\n| 1 + \u03c1e2i\u03c6 |2\n\n(19)\n\n4\u03c0\n\n4\u03c0\n\nwhere the notation \u03a9\u0302 describes a direction in space, while \u03c6 is a cavity detuning parameter\nthat will be detailed below. These expressions have a straighforward interpretation, because\nthey appear basically as integrals over the direction of light rays : in the integral over\nthe directions, \u03c1 is the mirror reflectivity for rays subtended by the cavity, and is zero for\nrays outside the cavity solid angle. The different factors appearing in the integrals can be\ninterpreted in the following way :\n\u2022 The first factor under the integral corresponds to polarisation effects, taking into\naccount the transverse character of the field.\n\u2022 The second (resonance) factor is of the usual Fabry-Perot form, where \u03c6 is the cavity\nphase shift which includes first a term \u03c60 = \u03c90 R/c. The complete calculation shows\nthat, in order to obtain a correct result outside the cavity center, \u03c6 should include\nalso a contribution from spherical aberrations, that is : \u03c6 = \u03c60 +\n\nk(r 2 \u2212(\u03a9\u0302.r)2 )\n.\n2R\n\nThis\n\nsecond term corresponds to the extra phase shift experienced by rays going through\npoint r while propagating along the \u03a9\u0302 direction. The resonance factor has different\nexpressions for the damping and the lamb shift terms, which correspond respectively\nto the active and reactive parts of the coupling. This is clearly apparent from the\nintegrals of eq. 13 and 14, which involve either a delta function or a principal part.\nIn the first case, the integration is trivial, and yields the resonance term of eq. 18,\n7\n\n\fwhile in the second case the result is obtained by contour integration [13], and gives\nthe (dispersive) second term of eq. 19.\n\u2022 The third term under the integrals is the stationnary wave pattern corresponding either\n\nto odd modes (with an anti-node in the center and a cos2 (k \u03a9\u0302.r) space dependence) or\n\nto even modes (with a node in the center and a sin2 (k \u03a9\u0302.r) space dependence).\n\u2022 Finally, the integration over the mirrors is conveniently performed in spherical coordinates, by taking the z axis along the cavity axis, and varying the azimuthal angle\n\u03b8 from 0 to \u03b8mirror = \u03b8m . Improved accuracy (better than 1%) is obtained if one\ntakes into account the fact that the rays which would be reflected near the edge of the\nmirror are actually lost due to diffraction and fail to do as many round-trips as the\nother ones. We have shown [13] that this effect can be taken into account very simply\n\u221a\nby decreasing \u03b8m to \u03b8ef f = \u03b8m \u2212 \u03b4\u03b8, with \u03b4\u03b8 = 1/ kRT for symmetrical mirrors.\nThe first results which can be obtained from the previous formulas are obviously the shift\nand damping at the cavity center, as a function of the atom-cavity detuning. For a dipole\norientation parallel to the cavity axis, we obtain straightforwardly :\n\u0393par (0)\n\u2206\u03a9vac\nsin2 \u03b8m\n\u2206\u03a9cav\ncos \u03b8m (1 + cos \u03b8m )\nT\n=\n(1 +\n)+\n(1 \u2212\n)\n\u0393vac\n4\u03c0\n2\n4\u03c0\n2\n| 1 \u2212 \u03c1e2i\u03c60 |2\n\u2206\u2032par (0)\n\u2206\u03a9cav\ncos \u03b8m (1 + cos \u03b8m ) \u03c1 sin(2\u03c60 )\n=\n(1 \u2212\n)\n\u0393vac\n4\u03c0\n2\n| 1 \u2212 \u03c1e2i\u03c60 |2\n\n(20)\n(21)\n\nwhile for a dipole orientation perpendicular to the cavity axis, we have :\n\n\u0393perp (0)\n\u2206\u03a9vac\nsin2 \u03b8m\n\u2206\u03a9cav\ncos \u03b8m (1 + cos \u03b8m )\nT\n=\n(1 \u2212\n)+\n(1 +\n)\n\u0393vac\n4\u03c0\n4\n4\u03c0\n4\n| 1 \u2212 \u03c1e2i\u03c60 |2\n\u2206\u2032perp (0)\n\u2206\u03a9cav\ncos \u03b8m (1 + cos \u03b8m ) \u03c1 sin(2\u03c60 )\n=\n(1 +\n)\n\u0393vac\n4\u03c0\n4\n| 1 \u2212 \u03c1e2i\u03c60 |2\n\n(22)\n(23)\n\nWe note that these expressions yield for a randomly oriented dipole :\n\u2206\u03a9vac \u2206\u03a9cav\nT\n\u0393av (0)\n=\n+\n,\n\u0393vac\n4\u03c0\n4\u03c0 | 1 \u2212 \u03c1e2i\u03c60 |2\n\n\u2206\u2032av (0)\n\u2206\u03a9cav \u03c1 sin(2\u03c60 )\n=\n\u0393vac\n4\u03c0 | 1 \u2212 \u03c1e2i\u03c60 |2\n\n(24)\n\nwhich have a straightforward interpretation in terms of resonant enhancement of the rays\nsubtended by the cavity. We note that these results are the same as those given in ref. [7], up\nto factor two resulting from the fact that this reference was considering spatially averaged\nvalues rather than the peak value at the cavity center (see below for the space dependence).\n8\n\n\fThese functions are plotted on fig. 1 for\n\n\u03a9cav\n4\u03c0\n\n= 0.3 and \u03c1 = 0.98. It can be seen that very\n\nsignificant effects occur for these quite reasonable parameters, yielding more than 30-fold\nincrease in the damping rate at the cavity center.\n40\n10\n\n\u0393(0) / \u0393(vac)\n\n\u2206'(0) / \u0393(vac)\n\n30\n\n5\n\n20\n\n-8\n\n-6\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n2\n\nDetuning\n-6\n\nFIG. 1:\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n6\n\n8\n\nDetuning\n\n10\n\n-8\n\n4\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n-5\n\n8\n\n-10\n\nNormalized damping \u0393(0)/\u0393vac (left) and level shift \u2206\u2032 (0)/\u0393vac (right) at the cavity\n\ncenter, as a function of the atom-cavity detuning (\u03c90 \u2212 \u03c9cav ) normalized to the cavity linewidth.\nThe amplitude reflection coefficient of the mirrors is taken to be \u03c1 = 0.98, and the numerical\naperture of the cavity is 0.7. The upper curves correspond to a dipole oriented perpendicular to\nthe cavity axis, and the lower curves to a dipole oriented along the cavity axis.\n\nWe can then look at the results as a function of space for a given frequency, which are\nessential for the present paper. Two atom-cavity detunings are specially worth looking at :\nthe resonant frequency at the cavity center, which yields maximum change in the damping\nrate but no cavity shift, and frequencies detuned by plus or minus half a cavity linewidth,\nwhich yield maximum cavity shifts. As an example, the results for the damping rates are\nplotted on fig. 2. The general values of the damping and level shifts for arbitrary values of\nthe reflectivities \u03c11 , \u03c12 of the two mirrors are given in [13], Appendix C.\n\nIV.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nFrom the results of the previous section one can deduce some features of the \"vacuuminduced\" force given by eq. 17. For simplicity, we consider an atom at point r with zero\nvelocity. The simplest configuration in which this force should be dominant is a weak\nstationnary wave resonant on the atom, but detuned from the cavity. In that case, both the\n9\n\n\fance from center\n\n20\n\n40\n\n\u0393(r) / \u0393(vac)\n\n\u0393(r) / \u0393(vac)\n30\n\n15\n\n20\n\n10\n\n10\n\n5\nDistance from center\n\n0\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nDistance from center\n\n0\n20\n\n120 140\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120 140\n\n40\n\n\u0393(r) / \u0393(vac)\n30\n20\n10\nDistance from center\n\n0\n2.5\n\n5\n\n7.5\n\n10\n\n12.5 15 17.5\n\n20\n\nFIG. 2: Spatial variation of the atomic damping \u0393(r)/\u0393vac on the cavity axis, obtained from the\nanalytical formula given in the text. The atom-cavity detuning is taken equal to zero at the cavity\ncenter (see Fig. 1), and the horizontal axis unit is 1/k. The amplitude reflection coefficient of\nthe mirrors is \u03c1 = 0.98, and the numerical aperture of the cavity is 0.7. The upper left curve\ncorresponds to a dipole oriented perpendicular to the cavity axis, the upper right curve to a dipole\noriented along the cavity axis, and the lower curve is a zoom close to the cavity center.\n\nusual scattering and dipole force are zero, while the cavity-induced light shift is maximum\nfor a detuning of about half a cavity width. It can be seen easily that the force is attractive\nwhen the cavity is detuned to the blue side of the atomic resonance (\u03c90 < \u03c9cav ) . This can\nbe understood physically by realizing that the cavity \"repels\" the excited state level, and\nthat this level has to go down in order to get an attractive potential. The corresponding\npotential wells are a few h\u0304\u0393 (see eq. 17), which is quite significant if cold atoms are used.\nBesides the effect described here in the weak excitation regime, another possibility is to\ncouple a laser beam inside the cavity, with a red atom-laser detuning, in order to create\na dipole trap attracting the atom towards the cavity center. A very interesting effect can\nthen be expected : since the atomic relaxation will be modified by the cavity, the balance\n10\n\n\fbetween the trapping and heating effects of the dipole trap will be changed with respect to\nfree space, enabling new regimes where the dipole force can be both attractive and damped.\nIn that case, the calculation above should be extended to moving atoms (non-zero velocity)\nin order to calculate friction forces, as well as to calculate the diffusion coefficient. For very\ncold atoms, the quantum aspect of motion should also be included; this could be done in\nprinciple since we have obtained the explicit space dependence of the trapping potential.\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nAs a conclusion, we have shown that macroscopic cavities with large numerical apertures\nare interesting candidates for cavity QED experiments in the optical domain. The possibility\nto use light-induced force to hold the atom close to the cavity center is quite attractive, and\nit offers the possibility to study a well defined quantum system, including its external degrees\nof freedom. The expressions that we have obtained are general, and by using the results\nof ref. [13] they can be applied to any kind of low-finesse cavity, including the case of a\n\"half-cavity\" with only one mirror imaging the dipole onto itself [22, 23, 24].\n\n[1] Bibliographic note : this paper was written in 1995, and it is presented here in its original form\nwith minor editing.
