We describe KMS-states on the C\u2217 -algebras of etale groupoids in terms of measurable\nfields of traces on the C\u2217 -algebras of the isotropy groups. We use this description to analyze tracial\nstates on the transformation groupoid C\u2217 -algebras and to give a short proof of recent results of\nCuntz, Deninger and Laca on the Toeplitz algebras of the ax + b semigroups of the rings of integers\nin number fields.\n\nIntroduction\nThe problem of classifying KMS-states for various C\u2217 -dynamical systems has been extensively\nstudied since the 1970s. Although it can be approached from different angles, one general result is\nparticularly useful and can be applied to almost all known examples. It is the theorem proved by\nRenault [12] which states that for the C\u2217 -algebra of an etale principal groupoid G with the dynamics\ngiven by an R-valued 1-cocycle c, there is a one-to-one correspondence between KMS\u03b2 -states and\nquasi-invariant probability measures on G(0) with Radon-Nikodym cocycle e\u2212\u03b2c . Once a C\u2217 -algebra\nis written as a groupoid C\u2217 -algebra, this theorem allows one, in many cases, to reduce the study of\nKMS-states to a measure-theoretic problem, to which results and methods of the dynamical systems\ntheory can be applied; see e.g. [3]. Recently, however, several natural examples of C\u2217 -algebras of\nnon-principal groupoids have emerged where the structure of KMS-states is relatively simple, but it\ncannot be understood in terms of quasi-invariant measures only. One such example is the Toeplitz\nalgebra of the semigroup N \u22ca N\u00d7 studied by Laca and Raeburn [8]. In this example one has, for\nevery \u03b2 > 2, a unique quasi-invariant measure on G(0) with the required Radon-Nikodym cocycle,\nbut the simplex of KMS\u03b2 -states is isomorphic to the simplex of probability measures on the unit\ncircle. The reason for this structure is that for non-principal groupoids possible extensions of a\nstate on C0 (G(0) ) to a KMS-state on C \u2217 (G) are determined by a choice of tracial states on the\nC\u2217 -algebras of the isotropy groups. In the case studied by Laca and Raeburn these isotropy groups\nturn out to be Z, and this explains why measures on the circle appear naturally in the classification\nof KMS-states. This idea was briefly outlined in the preliminary version [11] of this note and in the\nintroduction to [6]. In this extended version we formulate the result more explicitly and in a more\ngeneral setting than discussed in [11, 6], and consider more examples.\nThe proposed strategy for classifying KMS-states on the C\u2217 -algebra C \u2217 (G) of an etale groupoid\ncan therefore be described as follows, see Section 1 for precise statements. First we have to find\nall probability measures \u03bc on G(0) with Radon-Nikodym cocycle e\u2212\u03b2c . If the \u03bc-measure of the set\nof points with non-trivial isotropy is zero, then the only way to extend \u03bc\u2217 to a KMS\u03b2 -state is by\ncomposing \u03bc\u2217 with the canonical conditional expectation C \u2217 (G) \u2192 C0 (G(0) ). Otherwise all possible\nextensions of \u03bc\u2217 are obtained by choosing tracial states \u03c6x on the C\u2217 -algebras C \u2217 (Gxx ) of the isotropy\ngroups. The additional requirements on \u03c6x are that the field (\u03c6x )x is essentially G-invariant and\n\u03bc-measurable.\nThese requirements imply that it suffices to specify \u03c6x on a subset intersecting almost every orbit\nof points with non-trivial isotropy. If the action of G on G(0) has complicated dynamics and a lot of\nDate: June 29, 2011; minor corrections October 18, 2013.\nThis version is different in a few lines from the published version, correcting a potentially misleading omission of the\nRadon-Nikodym cocycle in the proof of Theorem 1.1; September 23, 2014.\nPartially supported by the Research Council of Norway.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nS. NESHVEYEV\n\nisotropy, this is hardly a simplification and our description of possible extensions of \u03bc\u2217 is probably\nnot very useful. But in many examples the measures \u03bc are concentrated on a set with only countably\nmany points with non-trivial isotropy. In such cases this description allows us to divide classification\nof KMS-states into two almost disjoint problems: classification of quasi-invariant measures on G(0)\nwith a given Radon-Nikodym cocycle and classification of tracial states on C \u2217 (Gxx ) for countably\nmany points.\nThis note consists of three sections. Section 1 contains our main general results. In Section 2 we\nexplain what they mean for transformation groupoids and tracial states. In particular, we will show\nthat classification of tracial states on crossed products by abelian groups reduces completely to a\nmeasure-theoretic problem. In Section 3 we consider the Toeplitz algebras of the ax+b semigroups of\nthe rings of integers in number fields, recently studied by Cuntz, Deninger and Laca [2], and recover\nthe classification of KMS-states obtained in [2]. Our approach clarifies why some computations in [2]\nresemble those used in the study of the Bost-Connes systems of number fields. It also explains why\ncertain representations play a prominent role in the construction of KMS-states in [2].\n1. KMS states on groupoid C\u2217 -algebras\nLet G be a locally compact second countable etale groupoid. We denote the unit space of G\nby G(0) , and the range and source maps G \u2192 G(0) by r and s, respectively. Recall that being etale\nmeans that r and s are local homeomorphisms. For x \u2208 G(0) put\nGx = r \u22121 (x), Gx = s\u22121 (x) and Gxx = Gx \u2229 Gx .\nThe C\u2217 -algebra C \u2217 (G) of the groupoid G is the C\u2217 -enveloping algebra of the \u2217-algebra Cc (G) with\nconvolution product\nX\n(f1 \u2217 f2 )(g) =\nf1 (h)f2 (h\u22121 g)\nh\u2208Gr(g)\n\nand involution f \u2217 (g) = f (g \u22121 ).\nLet \u03bc be a probability measure on G(0) . Assume that for \u03bc-a.e. x \u2208 G(0) we are given a state \u03c6x\non C \u2217 (Gxx ). Denote the generators of C \u2217 (Gxx ) by ug , g \u2208 Gxx . We say that the field of states\n{\u03c6x }x\u2208G(0) is \u03bc-measurable if for every f \u2208 Cc (G) the function\nX\nG(0) \u220b x 7\u2192\nf (g)\u03c6x (ug )\ng\u2208Gx\nx\n\nis \u03bc-measurable; note that this function is always bounded. We do not distinguish between measurable fields which agree for \u03bc-a.e. x.\nRecall that the centralizer A\u03c6 of a state \u03c6 on a C\u2217 -algebra A is the set of elements a \u2208 A such\nthat \u03c6(ab) = \u03c6(ba) for all b \u2208 A.\nTheorem 1.1. There is a one-to-one correspondence between states on C \u2217 (G) with the centralizer\ncontaining C0 (G(0) ) and pairs (\u03bc, {\u03c6x }x ) consisting of a probability measure \u03bc on G(0) and a \u03bcmeasurable field of states \u03c6x on C \u2217 (Gxx ). Namely, the state corresponding to (\u03bc, {\u03c6x }x ) is given by\nZ\nX\nf (g)\u03c6x (ug )d\u03bc(x) for f \u2208 Cc (G).\n\u03c6(f ) =\nG(0) g\u2208Gx\nx\n\nProof. Assume \u03c6 is a state on C \u2217 (G) with the centralizer containing C0 (G(0) ). Let (H, \u03c0, \u03be) be\nthe corresponding GNS-triple. By Renault's disintegration theorem [12, 13] the representation \u03c0 is\nthe integrated form of a representation of G on a measurable, with\nR \u2295 respect to a measure class [\u03bd]\non G(0) , field of Hilbert spaces Hx , x \u2208 G(0) . Identifying H with G(0) Hx d\u03bd(x), consider the vector\nfield (\u03bex )x that defines \u03be. Let \u03bc be the measure on G(0) such that d\u03bc(x) = k\u03bex k2 d\u03bd(x). In other\nwords, \u03bc is the measure defined by the restriction of \u03c6 to C0 (G(0) ). The action of G on (Hx )x defines,\n\n\fKMS STATES ON THE C\u2217 -ALGEBRAS OF NON-PRINCIPAL GROUPOIDS\n\n3\n\nfor every x, a representation \u03c1x : C \u2217 (Gxx ) \u2192 B(Hx ). For every x with \u03bex 6= 0 denote by \u03c6x the state\nk\u03bex k\u22122 (\u03c1x (*)\u03bex , \u03bex ) on C \u2217 (Gxx ).\nFor every f \u2208 Cc (G) we have\nZ X\nD(g)\u22121/2 f (g)(g\u03bes(g) , \u03bex )d\u03bd(x),\n\u03c6(f ) = (\u03c0(f )\u03be, \u03be) =\nX g\u2208Gx\n\nwhere D is the Radon-Nikodym cocycle defined by the quasi-invariant measure \u03bd. Therefore to\nprove the identity in the formulation of the theorem we have to show that for \u03bd-a.e. x and every\ng \u2208 Gx \\ Gxx we have (g\u03bes(g) , \u03bex ) = 0 (note that D(g) = 1 for \u03bd-a.e. x \u2208 G(0) and all g \u2208 Gxx ). Choose\nan open subset U \u2282 G \\ G\u2032 , where G\u2032 = \u222ax Gxx is the isotropy bundle, such that r(U ) \u2229 s(U ) = \u2205.\nLet f \u2208 Cc (U ). For any function h \u2208 Cc (r(U )) we have f \u2217 h = 0. Since h is in the centralizer of \u03c6,\nwe therefore get\nZ\nX\nh(x)\nD(g)\u22121/2 f (g)(g\u03bes(g) , \u03bex )d\u03bd(x).\n0 = \u03c6(h \u2217 f ) =\nr(U )\n\ng\u2208Gx\n\nP\n\nHence g\u2208Gx D(g)\u22121/2 f (g)(g\u03bes(g) , \u03bex ) = 0 for \u03bd-a.e. x \u2208 r(U ). It follows that (g\u03bes(g) , \u03bex ) = 0 for\n\u03bd-a.e. x \u2208 r(U ) and all g \u2208 Gx \u2229 U . Since G \\ G\u2032 can be covered by countably many such sets U , we\nconclude that (g\u03bes(g) , \u03bex ) = 0 for \u03bd-a.e. x \u2208 G(0) and all g \u2208 Gx \\ Gxx .\nConversely, assume we are given a probability measure \u03bc on G(0) and a \u03bc-measurable field of\nstates \u03c6x on C \u2217 (Gxx ). For every x define a state \u03c8x on C \u2217 (G) by\nX\n\u03c8x (f ) =\nf (g)\u03c6x (ug ) for f \u2208 Cc (G).\ng\u2208Gx\nx\n\nIn order to show that \u03c8x is indeed a well-defined state, consider the GNS-triple (Kx , \u03c0x , \u03bex ) defined\nby \u03c6x . Induce \u03c0x to a representation of G and denote by \u03b8x its integrated form. Explicitly, \u03b8x is\nthe representation on the space Lx of functions \u03be : Gx \u2192 Kx such that\nX\n\u03be(gh) = \u03c0x (u\u2217h )\u03be(g) for g \u2208 Gx and h \u2208 Gxx , and\nk\u03be(g)k2 < \u221e,\ng\u2208Gx /Gx\nx\n\ngiven by\n(\u03b8x (f )\u03be)(g) =\n\nX\n\nf (h)\u03be(h\u22121 g) for f \u2208 Cc (G).\n\nh\u2208Gr(g)\n\nLet \u03b6x \u2208 Lx be the vector defined by \u03b6x (g) = \u03c0x (u\u2217g )\u03bex if g \u2208 Gxx and \u03b6x (g) = 0 if \u03b6 \u2208 Gx \\ Gxx . Then\n\u03c8x = (\u03b8x (*)\u03b6x , \u03b6x ).\nClearly, C0 (X) is contained in the centralizer of \u03c8x ; in fact, for any f \u2208 C0 (X) and a \u2208 C \u2217 (G) we\nhave \u03c8x (f a) = \u03c8x (af ) = f (x)\u03c8x (a). By assumption, the map x 7\u2192 \u03c8x (a)\nR is \u03bc-measurable for every\na \u2208 Cc (G), hence for every a \u2208 C \u2217 (G). Therefore we can define \u03c6(a) = X \u03c8x (a)d\u03bc(x).\nFinally, it is easy to see that if (\u03bc, {\u03c6x }x ) and (\u03bc\u0303, {\u03c6\u0303x }x ) define the same state then \u03bc = \u03bc\u0303 and\n\u03c6x = \u03c6\u0303x for \u03bc-a.e. x.\n\u0003\nLet E : C \u2217 (G) \u2192 C0 (G(0) ) be the canonical conditional expectation. Given a probability measure \u03bc on G(0) , consider the \u03bc-measurable field of states consisting of canonical traces on C \u2217 (Gxx ).\nThe corresponding state on C \u2217 (G) is \u03bc\u2217 \u25e6 E.\nCorollary 1.2. Let \u03bc be a probability measure on G(0) . Assume that the points of G(0) with nontrivial isotropy form a set of \u03bc-measure zero.

Since the centralizer of any \u03c3 c -KMS-state \u03c6 contains C0 (G(0) ), by Theorem 1.1 any such state is defined by a pair (\u03bc, {\u03c6x }x ) consisting of a probability measure \u03bc on G(0)\nand a \u03bc-measurable field of states \u03c6x on C \u2217 (Gxx ).

As we already noted, this corresponds to taking the canonical\ntraces on C \u2217 (Gxx ) for \u03c6x . If the points with non-trivial isotropy have measure zero, then \u03bc\u2217 \u25e6 E is\nthe unique \u03c3 c -KMS\u03b2 -state extending \u03bc\u2217 . In general, to extend \u03bc\u2217 we have to find measurable fields\nof tracial states satisfying properties (ii) and (iii) above. If there are many points with non-trivial\nisotropy, this is a difficult problem and it is not clear how useful the description in terms of fields of\ntraces is. A simple example of such a rich isotropy bundle structure is the transformation groupoid of\nthe action of the infinite symmetric group S\u221e on {0, 1}\u221e . In many cases, however, the measure \u03bc is\nconcentrated on a set with only countably many points with non-trivial isotropy, and then the above\nresult gives a complete description of possible extensions of \u03bc\u2217 .\nCorollary 1.4.

Every orbit On is a countable set, so the measurability assumption is satisfied for any choice of\nstates \u03c6x on C \u2217 (Gxx ) for x \u2208 On .

Then C0 (X) \u22ca \u0393 is the C\u2217 -algebra of the transformation groupoid X \u00d7 \u0393. We\nwill apply the results of the previous section to describe tracial states on C0 (X) \u22ca \u0393.\nFor x \u2208 X, denote by \u0393x the stabilizer of x in \u0393. Let \u03bc be a probability measure on X. According\nto our definition, a field of states \u03c6x on C \u2217 (\u0393x ) is \u03bc-measurable if, for every g \u2208 \u0393, the function\nx 7\u2192 \u03c6x (ug ) is \u03bc-measurable on the closed set of points fixed by g. This can also be formulated as\nfollows.\nEvery state \u03c6x extends to a state \u03c8x on C \u2217 (\u0393) such that \u03c8x (ug ) = 0 for every g \u2208\n/ \u0393x . This\ncan be proved using induction, exactly as in the proof of Theorem 1.1, so we will write Ind\u0393\u0393x \u03c6x\nfor \u03c8x . Then {\u03c6x }x is \u03bc-measurable if and only if the map x 7\u2192 Ind\u0393\u0393x \u03c6x from X into the state space\nS(C \u2217 (\u0393)) of C \u2217 (\u0393) is \u03bc-measurable, where S(C \u2217 (\u0393)) is considered with the Borel structure defined\nby the weak\u2217 topology.\nApplying Theorem 1.3 to the transformation groupoid X \u00d7 \u0393 and the zero cocycle, we get the\nfollowing result.\nTheorem 2.1. There is a one-to-one correspondence between tracial states on C0 (X) \u22ca \u0393 and pairs\n(\u03bc, {\u03c6x }x ) consisting of a probability measure \u03bc on X and a \u03bc-measurable field of states \u03c6x on C \u2217 (\u0393x )\nsuch that:\n(i) \u03bc is \u0393-invariant;\n(ii) \u03c6x (ug ) = \u03c6hx (uhgh\u22121 ) for \u03bc-a.e. x and all g \u2208 \u0393x and h \u2208 \u0393.\nEquivalently, we can say that to define a tracial state we need a \u0393-invariant probability measure \u03bc\non X and a field of tracial states \u03c6x on C \u2217 (\u0393x ) such that the map x 7\u2192 Ind\u0393\u0393x \u03c6x \u2208 S(C \u2217 (\u0393)) is \u03bcmeasurable and \u0393-equivariant, where g \u2208 \u0393 acts on S(C \u2217 (\u0393)) by mapping a state \u03c8 into \u03c8\u25e6(Ad ug )\u22121 .\nThe above result was obtained using Renault's disintegration theorem. In the case of transformation groupoids this theorem is a simple consequence of standard results on disintegration of\nrepresentations of C\u2217 -algebras, see e.g. [14, Chapter IV]. But, in fact, in this case the groupoid\npicture can be bypassed altogether. In order to show this we will need the following observation,\nwhich in a way goes back to [9, Appendix].\nLemma 2.2. For any state \u03c6 on a unital C\u2217 -algebra A, there exists a unique state \u03a6 on Aop\n\u03c6 \u2297max A\nsuch that \u03a6(a \u2297 b) = \u03c6(ab) for all a \u2208 A\u03c6 and b \u2208 A.\nProof. We may assume that A \u2282 B(H) and \u03c6 is defined by a cyclic vector \u03be \u2208 H. Assume first that \u03be\nis separating for A\u2032\u2032 . Let J be the corresponding modular conjugation. Define a representation \u03c0 of\n\u2217\n\u2217\nAop\n\u03c6 \u2297max A on H by \u03c0(a \u2297 b) = Ja Jb = bJa J. If a \u2208 A\u03c6 , then a commutes with the modular\n\u2217\noperator, hence Ja\u03be = a \u03be. Therefore \u03c0(a \u2297 b)\u03be = ba\u03be, so that \u03a6 := (\u03c0(*), \u03be, \u03be) is the required state.\nIn the general case we will show that a representation \u03c0 of Aop\n\u03c6 \u2297max A such that \u03c0(a \u2297 b)\u03be = ba\u03be\nalways exists. For a \u2208 A\u03c6 and b, c \u2208 A we have\n(ba\u03be, c\u03be) = (b\u03be, ca\u2217 \u03be).\nIt follows that for every a \u2208 A\u03c6 there exists a well-defined operator \u03c1(a) on A\u03be such that \u03c1(a)b\u03be = ba\u03be,\nand then \u03c1 is a representation of Aop\n\u03c6 on A\u03be. Since \u03c1(u) is unitary for unitary u, this is a representation\nby bounded operators, so it extends to a representation of Aop\n\u03c6 on H. Its image commutes with A, so\nwe can define a representation \u03c0 of Aop\n\u03c6 \u2297max A on H by \u03c0(a \u2297 b) = \u03c1(a)b. Then \u03c0(a \u2297 b)\u03be = ba\u03be. \u0003\nAssume now that \u03c6 is a state on A = C0 (X) \u22ca \u0393 with the centralizer containing C0 (X). Using the\nabove lemma define a state \u03a6 on C0 (X) \u2297 A. Denote by j the canonical homomorphism C \u2217 (\u0393) \u2192\nM (A).

We only need to note that if \u03c6x is the state on C \u2217 (\u0393) = C(\u0393\u0302) defined by \u03bdx then \u03c6x (ug ) = 0\nfor all g \u2208\n/ \u0393x if and only if \u03bdx is \u0393\u22a5\n\u0003\nx -invariant.\nNote that in this case it is particularly easy to check that the state \u03c4 corresponding to \u03bd exists.\nIndeed, define a representation \u03c1 of C0 (X) \u22ca \u0393 on L2 (X \u00d7 \u0393\u0302, d\u03bd) by\n(\u03c1(f )\u03b6)(x, \u03c7) = f (x)\u03b6(x, \u03c7), (\u03c1(ug )\u03b6)(x, \u03c7) = \u03c7(g)\u03b6(g \u22121 x, \u03c7)\nand consider the function \u03be \u2261 1 in L2 (X \u00d7 \u011c, d\u03bd). Then \u03c4 = (\u03c1(*)\u03be, \u03be).\nCorollary 2.4. If \u0393 is abelian, there exists a one-to-one correspondence between extremal tracial\nstates on C0 (X) \u22ca \u0393 and triples (H, \u03c7, \u03bc), where H is a subgroup of \u0393, \u03c7 is a character of H and \u03bc is\nan ergodic \u0393-invariant probability measure \u03bc on X such that \u0393x = H for \u03bc-a.e. x \u2208 X.

Extremal tracial states correspond to extremal probability measures \u03bd on X \u00d7 \u0393\u0302 with properties (i) and (ii) in Corollary 2.3. If \u03bd is extremal, then its projection \u03bc onto X is an extremal\n\u0393-invariant measure, that is, \u03bc is ergodic. But then \u03bd must be of the form \u03bc \u00d7 \u03bb for a probability\nmeasure \u03bb on \u0393\u0302. Furthermore, for every g \u2208 \u0393 the set Xg = {x | gx = x} is \u0393-invariant, so either Xg\nor its complement has measure zero. In other words, on a subset of full measure we have \u0393x = H for\na subgroup H \u2282 \u0393. Hence \u03bb is H \u22a5 -invariant, so it can be considered as a measure on \u0393\u0302/H \u22a5 = \u0124.\nAs \u03bd is extremal, \u03bb is an extremal probability measure on \u0124, that is, \u03bb = \u03b4\u03c7 for some \u03c7 \u2208 \u0124.\nConversely, any measure \u03bd of the form \u03bc \u00d7 \u03b4\u03c7 , where \u03bc is ergodic and \u03c7 \u2208 \u0124, where H is the\ncommon stabilizer of the points in a subset of X of full measure, is an extremal measure with\nproperties (i) and (ii).\n\u0003\n\n\f8\n\nS. NESHVEYEV\n\nRemark 2.5. If \u03c4 is the extremal tracial state corresponding to a triple (H, \u03c7, \u03bc), then there is a\nnon-canonical isomorphism \u03c0\u03c4 (C0 (X) \u22ca \u0393)\u2032\u2032 \u223c\n= L\u221e (X, \u03bc) \u22ca \u0393/H. Namely, extend \u03c7 to a character \u03c7\u0303\nof \u0393. Then the required isomorphism \u03c1 is given by \u03c1(f ) = f \u2208 L\u221e (X, \u03bc), \u03c1(ug ) = \u03c7\u0303(g)u\u1e21 , where \u1e21\nis the image of g in \u0393/H. Note that since L\u221e (X, \u03bc) \u22ca \u0393/H is a factor, this provides a direct proof\nof the extremality of \u03c4 .\nFinally, consider the case \u0393 = Z explicitly used in [6]. Denote by T : X \u2192 X the homeomorphism\ncorresponding to 1 \u2208 Z. For n \u2265 0 denote by Xn \u2282 X the subset of points of period n (so X0 is the\nset of aperiodic points). Then any measure \u03bd on X \u00d7 T with properties (i) and (ii) from Corollary 2.3\ndecomposes into a sum of measures satisfying the same properties and concentrated on Xn \u00d7 T for\nsome n.\nIf \u03bd is concentrated on X0 then \u03bd = \u03bc\u00d7\u03bb, where \u03bb is the Lebesgue measure, and the corresponding\ntrace is \u03bc\u2217 \u25e6 E, where E : C0 (X) \u22ca Z \u2192 C0 (X) is the canonical conditional expectation.\nIf \u03bc is concentrated on Xn , n \u2265 1, then \u03bd is a Z/nZ \u00d7 Z/nZ-invariant measure on Xn \u00d7 T, where\nthe second factor Z/nZ acts on T by rotations. Consider the simplest case where \u03bc is concentrated\nPn\u22121\non the orbit of a point x of period n. Then \u03bc = n\u22121 k=0\n\u03b4T k x and \u03bd = \u03bc \u00d7 \u03bb, where \u03bb is a measure\nthat is invariant under the rotation by 2\u03c0/n degrees (we will say that \u03bb is n-rotation invariant). The\ncorresponding trace can be written as follows.\nThe \u2217-homomorphism \u03c1 : C0 (X) \u2192 C(Z/nZ), \u03c1(f )(k) = f (T k x), extends to a \u2217-homomorphism\n\u03c1 : C0 (X) \u22ca Z \u2192 C(Z/nZ) \u22ca Z.\nPassing to the dual groups we can identify C(Z/nZ) \u22ca Z with C(T) \u22ca Z/nZ. By composing the\ncanonical conditional expectation C(T) \u22ca Z/nZ \u2192 C(T) = C \u2217 (Z) with \u03c1 we then get a completely\npositive map\n!\nn\u22121\n1 X\nk\n\u2217\nm\nf (T x) um ,\nEx : C0 (X) \u22ca Z \u2192 C (Z), Ex (f u ) =\nn\nk=0\n\nwhere u = u1 \u2208 M (C0 (X) \u22ca Z) is the canonical unitary\nimplementing T , so uf u\u2217 = f (T \u22121 *). The\nR\nmeasure \u03bb defines a state \u03bb\u2217 on C \u2217 (Z) by \u03bb\u2217 (um ) = T z m d\u03bb(z). Then \u03bb\u2217 \u25e6 Ex is the required tracial\nstate on C0 (X) \u22ca Z.\nIt follows that in the case when there are only countably many periodic orbits Corollary 2.3\nfor \u0393 = Z can be formulated as follows.\nCorollary 2.6. Assume a homeomorphism T of X has at most countably many periodic orbits On .\nFor every n choose xn \u2208 On . Then any tracial state \u03c4 on C0 (X) \u22ca Z has a unique decomposition\nX\n\u03c4 = \u03bc\u2217 \u25e6 E +\n\u03bbn\u2217 \u25e6 Exn ,\nn\n\nwhere \u03bc is a T -invariant measure on\nP X such that \u03bc(On ) = 0 for every n, \u03bbn is an |On |-rotation invariant measure on T, and \u03bc(X)+ n \u03bbn (T) = 1. Conversely, any such collection of measures \u03bc, \u03bbn\ndefines a tracial state.\n3. KMS states on the Toeplitz algebras of ax + b semigroups\n\nIn a recent paper Cuntz, Deninger and Laca [2] have studied the Toeplitz algebra of the ax + b\nsemigroup of the ring of integers in a number field. In this section we will show how to recover their\nclassification of KMS-states using our general framework. In addition to illustrating the general\ntheory, our goal is to clarify a connection between the rather involved analysis in [2] and that of the\nBost-Connes systems of number fields.\nWe will follow the notation in [7] rather than the one in [2]. Let K be a number field with the\nring of integers O. Denote by VK the set of places of K, and by VK,f \u2282 VK the subset of finite\nplaces. For every place v denote by Kv the completion of K at v. For v \u2208 VK,f , let Ov be the\n\n\fKMS STATES ON THE C\u2217 -ALGEBRAS OF NON-PRINCIPAL GROUPOIDS\n\n9\n\nQ\n\nclosure of O in Kv . We write v|\u221e when v is infinite and denote by K\u221e = v|\u221e Kv the completion\nof K at all infinite places. The adele ring AK is the restricted product, as v ranges over all places,\nof the rings Kv , with respect to Ov \u2282 Kv for v \u2208 VK,f . When the product is taken only over finite\nplaces v, we get the ring AK,f of finite adeles; we then have AK = K\u221e \u00d7 AK,f .

Although T[O] can be defined in terms of generators and relations, we will\nuse a presentation of T[O] as a groupoid C\u2217 -algebra. For this consider the space \u03a9K defined as the\nb\u2217 by the equivalence relation\nquotient of AK,f \u00d7 AK,f /O\nb\n(r, a) \u223c (s, b) \u21d4 a = b and r \u2212 s \u2208 aO.\n\nb\u2217 and r \u2208 AK,f /aO.\nb It is a locally\nIn other words, \u03a9K consists of pairs (r, a) with a \u2208 AK,f /O\ncompact space with the quotient topology.

This action defines an action of K \u22ca K \u2217 on \u03a9K .

The homomorphism K \u22ca K \u2192 R, (n, k) 7\u2192 \u2212 log NK (k), defines a 1-cocycle on the groupoid,\nwhich in turn defines a dynamics \u03c3 on T[O].\nAccording to our general scheme, in order to classify \u03c3-KMS\u03b2 -states on T[O] we first have to find\n\u03b2\n.

For \u03b2 > 2 we have \u03bd =\n\u03b2\n\u03b2\n\nis the Dedekind \u03b6-function.\n\nhK\nX\n\u03b6(\u03b2 \u2212 1, [an ])\n\u03bdan ,\u03b2 , where \u03b6K\n\u03b6K (\u03b2 \u2212 1)\nn=1\n\n\f12\n\nS. NESHVEYEV\n\nb\u2217 defines an action of the group of principal ideals. Induce this action\nThe action of K \u2217 on AK,f /O\nto an action of the whole group JK of fractional ideals. By a general result on Morita equivalent\nsystems [5, Theorem 3.2], the set of KMS-weights remains the same under induction. In the present\ncase, when everything is formulated in terms of measures, this is quite obvious: a Radon measure\nwith a given Radon-Nikodym cocycle with respect to a group action is completely determined by\nits restriction to any compact open subset intersecting every orbit. From this it can be deduced\nthat classification of measures satisfying (3.1) is equivalent to classifying probability measures \u03bd on\nb O\nb\u2217 such that\nCl(K) \u00d7 O/\nb O\nb\u2217 and a \u2208 JK .\n\u03bd(aY ) = NK (a)\u2212(\u03b2\u22121) \u03bd(Y ) for Borel Y \u2282 Cl(K) \u00d7 O/\n\n(3.3)\n\nb\u2217 on Cl(K) \u00d7 AK,f /O\nb\u2217 is diagonal, so for every v the element\nHere the action of JK = A\u2217K,f /O\npv \u2208 JK changes only two coordinates, one corresponds to Cl(K), the other to the place v.\nThe Bost-Connes system for K, in turn, is defined using the partially defined diagonal action\nof JK on the space\nb\nYK = Gal(K ab /K) \u00d7Ob\u2217 O.\nb\u2217 acts on Gal(K ab /K) via the Artin map rK : A\u2217 \u2192 Gal(K ab /K). We have\nHere O\nK\n\u2217 b\u2217\nGal(K ab /K)/rK (K\u221e\nO ) = Gal(H(K)/K) \u223c\n= Cl(K),\n\nwhere H(K) is the Hilbert class field of K. Thus\n\nb O\nb\u2217 = YK /rK (K \u2217 O\nb\u2217 ).\nCl(K) \u00d7 O/\n\u221e\n\nTherefore the uniqueness of measures satisfying (3.3), or (3.1), is equivalent to the uniqueness of\n\u2217 O\nb\u2217 )-invariant measures on YK satisfying the same scaling property. In other words, TheorK (K\u221e\n\u2217 O\nb\u2217 )-invariant KMS\u03b2\u22121 -states on the\nrem 3.4 is essentially equivalent to the uniqueness of rK (K\u221e\nBost-Connes system for K for 1 < \u03b2 \u2264 2. That a KMS\u03b2\u22121 -state for the Bost-Connes system is\nunique for every inverse temperature in this region is proved in [4, Theorem 2.1].\nReferences\n[1] J.-B. Bost and A.
