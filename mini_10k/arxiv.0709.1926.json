Highand low-mass stars form from gas in the disk and put back energy into the gas. Some gas\nescapes from the disk, forming a hot atmosphere. As this gas cools and rains back it forms\na \"Galactic Fountain\". The hot atmosphere has been called the \"Galactic Corona\", and\nit extends up to 10 kpc above the Galactic disk. There is also infall of new material that\nprovides fuel for galaxy growth. This material can originate in small satellite galaxies, as\ngas tidally pulled out of passing galaxies, and from more pristine intergalactic gas. The\ncool clouds that fall in would be embedded in (or condense out of) a much more extended\n(100\u2013200 kpc radius) hot Corona, different from the one formed by star-formation processes.\nIndirect evidence for infalling gas is provided by two arguments (Chiappini et al. 2001).\nFirst, at the current rate of star formation, all of the ISM would be turned into gas within\nabout a Gyr. Second, the narrowness of the distribution of metallicities of long-lived stars is\nbest explained if the metallicity of the ISM remains more or less constant over a Hubble time,\nwhich happens if there is an inflow of low-metallicity material from outside. The predicted\ninflow rate decreases with time and at present is on the order of 1 M\u2299 yr\u22121 .\nDirect observational evidence for the processes mentioned above is provided by the highvelocity clouds (see reviews by Wakker & van Woerden 1997; Richter 2006). They are defined\nobservationally as clouds with velocities that are incompatible with differential galactic rotation. In practice this means |vLSR |>50 km s\u22121 . Historically, such gas has been divided into\nthe high-velocity clouds (HVCs), having |vLSR |>90 or >100 km s\u22121 , and the intermediatevelocity clouds (IVCs), with |vLSR |=50 to 100 km s\u22121 . They have been mapped extensively\n1\n\nBased on observations carried out at the European Southern Observatory (ESO), La Silla, under prog. ID\nNo. 077.B-0359 (PI: P. Richter) with the UVES spectrograph at the ESO Very Large Telescope, Paranal,\nChile.\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nin 21-cm emission (see Hulsbosch & Wakker 1988; Wakker & van Woerden 1991; Hartmann\n& Burton 1997; Morras et al. 2000; Kalberla et al. 2005). The different origins of different\nclouds can be determined by measuring their metallicities and distances. Solar metallicity\nclouds near the disk trace the Galactic Fountain. Distant (>5 kpc), low-metallicity (0.01-0.2\nsolar) clouds trace infall. Long streams with intermediate metallicity are likely to be tidal.\nIntrinsic metallicities (Z) have been determined for a few HVCs (see van Woerden & Wakker\n2004 for a summary). The best values are Z\u223c0.15 times solar for complex C (Wakker et\nal. 1999; Richter et al. 2001; Tripp et al. 2003; Sembach et al. 2004), while clouds in the\nMagellanic Stream have SMC-like metallicity (\u223c 0.25 solar; Lu et al. 1998; Gibson et al.\n2000). Van Woerden & Wakker (2004) list approximate values for a total of eight HVCs,\nranging from 0.1 to 1 times solar. In contrast, the intermediate-velocity clouds are usually\nfound to have near-solar metallicity (Wakker 2001; Richter et al. 2001).\nThe main unknown for the HVCs remains their distances. If we knew these, we could\nderive empirical (rather than theoretical) estimates for the rate of accretion of low-metallicity\n(0.01\u20130.1 solar) gas, the rate of circulation of gas between disk and halo,, and the mass of\ntidal material around the Milky Way. Furthermore, HVCs could be used to calibrate the\nfraction of ionizing photons escaping the Milky Way disk, as many HVCs are seen in H\u03b1\nemission (see Bland-Hawthorn & Maloney 1999).\nAlthough the first paper on determining distances to HVCs was published four decades\nago (Prata & Wallerstein 1967), progress has been slow. Wakker (2001) summarized the\nstate of knowledge a few years back. It is clear that distances to several IVCs are on the\norder of 1\u20132 kpc. However, for HVCs Wakker (2001) only lists lower limits of 6 kpc to\ncomplex C (vLSR \u223c\u2212150 km s\u22121 ), 5 kpc to complex H (vLSR \u223c\u2212180 km s\u22121 ), and 0.3 kpc to\nthe Anti-Center clouds (clouds with vLSR \u223c\u2212250 km s\u22121 and vLSR \u223c\u2212100 km s\u22121 ), as well\nas two upper limits \u2013 10 kpc for the high-latitude part of complex A (vLSR \u223c\u2212150 km s\u22121 ),\nbased on the RR Lyrae star AD UMa (van Woerden et al. 1999), and 13 kpc for complex WE\n(vLSR \u223c+110 km s\u22121 ), using the O9.7II star HD 156359 (Sembach et al. 1993). Since then,\nWakker et al. (2003) has reported a lower limit of 8 kpc for complex A, while Thom et\nal. (2006) used the star HE 1048+0231 to set an upper limit of 8.8 kpc to cloud WW 35\n(vLSR \u223c+100 km s\u22121 ).\nIn this paper we report on our observations of 25 targets in the direction to two HVCs\nand two IVCs. These yield distance brackets to all four clouds. We describe the method\nused to derive the distances of these clouds in Sect. 2. Sect. 3 summarizes our observations,\nwhile the manner in which we make our measurements is discussed in Sect. 4. Section 5\npresents the results for each of the four clouds, describing the distance determination, notes\non each of the stars, a summary of Ca II/H I ratios, a discussion of the implied location in\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nthe Milky Way and a discussion of their ionized hydrogen content. In Sect. 6 we present a\nshort general discussion of our results, while in Sect. 7 we summarize the conclusions.\n\n2.\n\nDeterming HVC/IVC distances\n2.1.\n\nBasic method\n\nThe distance to an HVC/IVC can be determined by looking for interstellar absorption at\nthe velocity of the cloud in spectra of stars with known distances. A detection sets an upper\nlimit, while a significant non-detection sets a lower limit. A significant non-detection means\nthat the ratio of the expected equivalent width to the observed upper limit is sufficiently\nlarge (e.g. >10; the exact value depends on the ion that is observed, and on knowledge of the\ncloud's ionic abundance, see Wakker 2001). The best kind of stars for this purpose are Blue\nHorizontal Branch (BHB) and RR Lyrae stars (in their hot phase). This is because they are\nfairly numerous, their distances can be determined relatively well, and they are relatively\nblue, resulting in few confusing stellar lines. This method is described in detail by Wakker\n& van Woerden (1997) and Wakker (2001).\nThere are three steps in the method: (1) locate candidate probe stars, (2) obtain\nintermediate-resolution spectra and photometry to derive their distances, velocities and\nabundances, and (3) obtain high spectral resolution (15 km s\u22121 or better) and high signalto-noise ratio spectra for stars at a range of distances; these stars should be selected to have\nminimal blending between stellar and interstellar lines. In this paper, we only summarize\nsteps (1) and (2), while we report on the most extensive set of step (3) observations presented\nin the literature so far. Our extensive program covering steps (1) and (2) will be described\nin subsequent papers.\n\n2.2.\n\nStellar probes\n\nUntil recently, most of the candidate stellar probes were found from three catalogues:\nthe variable star lists of Kukarkin (1969, 1970), the PG survey (Green et al. 1986) and the\nHK survey (Beers et al. 1996). These list many BHB and RR Lyrae candidates with distances\nup to about 5 kpc, as well as a few more distant stars (up to \u223c10 kpc). The recent data\nfrom the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the 2-Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS; Cutri\net al. 2003) now allow us to make further progress, adding candidate stars at up to 100 kpc\ndistance.\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nThe SDSS project and the creation of the archive are discussed by York et al. (2000).\nThe details of the data products are described by Stoughton et al. (2001) and by AdelmanMcCarthy et al. (2005 and references therein). A 2.5-meter telescope (Gunn et al. 2006)\nis equipped with two dual-beam spectrographs (R\u223c1800), operating between 3900 \u00c5 and\n9000 \u00c5, and with a CCD camera (Gunn et al. 1998) with a 5 filter photometric system\n(Fukugita et al. 1996), calibrated on imaging nights with a 20-inch Photometric Telescope\n(Hogg et al. 2001, Smith et al. 2002; Ivezic et al. 2004; Tucker et al. 2006). The CCD\ncamera is used to scan the northern sky in the five filters, from which our RR Lyrae or BHB\ncandidate stars are chosen, using color criteria (Sirko et al. 2004; Ivezi\u0107 et al. 2005). The\nstar positions are determined in the manner described by Pier et al. (2003). These stars\nhave distances ranging from \u223c5 kpc up to 100 kpc, as estimated from their V magnitudes\n(V =0.56r+0.44g+0.056; Ivez\u0131\u0301c et al. 2000) and assuming an absolute magnitude of MV =0.7\nfor RR Lyraes (Layden et al. 1996) and MV =1.040 + (B\u2212V )*(\u22124.423+(B\u2212V )*(17.74+(B\u2212V )*(\u221235.73)))\nfor BHBs (Preston et al. 1991).\nThe 2MASS survey scanned the sky at 2\u2032\u2032 pixels, using automated 1.3m telescopes on\nMt. Hopkins and CTIO, taking images at J, H, and K. It includes thousands of BHB\ncandidates with distances up to \u223c8 kpc, which can be selected from their J\u2212H and J\u2212K\ncolors (Brown et al. 2004).\nFor some stars the SDSS provides intermediate-resolution (\u223c2 \u00c5) spectra. To obtain\nsimilar spectra for more SDSS stars, as well as for the 2MASS selected stars, we have a large\nobserving project underway at the 3.5-meter telescope at Apache Point Observatory (APO).\nBetween 2003 and 2006 we obtained spectra at APO for some 200 stars.\nUsing these spectra, we can derive the effective temperature and gravity for each star,\nfollowing the method outlined by Wilhelm et al. (1999). Combining with photometry these\nparameters can be used to derive good distance estimates. We will describe these observations (as well as improvements to the original method) in a separate paper (Wilhelm et al.\n2007, in preparation). Here we just present an outline.\nOur method compares the observed photometry (either SDSS ugr or Johnson UBV ),\nand observed spectroscopy. We compare the Balmer line widths and equivalent width of\nthe Ca II K line with a grid of sythetic colors and spectroscopy parameters that are generated from Atlas9 model atmospheres. Combining the Balmer line widths with u\u2212g (or\nU\u2212B) color indices allows the determination of log g values across the temperature range\n6000<Teff <12000 K. The determined stellar parameters (Teff , log g and [Fe/H]) are then used\nto estimate absolute magnitudes MV by placing the star on the theoretical isochrones of Girardi et al. (2004). This method allows the determination of distances for stars of various\nmetallicities on the zero-age horizontal branch, on the main-sequence, as well as for terminal\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nHB stars and post-main sequence blue stragglers. We estimate errors in the stellar parameters by changing the input values for observables (i.e. line widths and colors) by \u00b11\u03c3 one\nobservable at a time. We thus recalculate Teff , log g, [Fe/H], MV , and D many times. The\nerror follows as the rms spread in the set of results for each parameter.\n\n2.3.\n\nImplementation\n\nThe results of the programs described above yield a sample of stars with known distances in the direction of HVCs. These then need to be observed with high spectral resolution\n(R>20000), in order to separate the different interstellar absorption components, as well as\nto maximize the sensitivity to the \u223c20 km s\u22121 wide HVC/IVC absorptions. In principle,\nMg II\u03bb\u03bb2796.352, 2803.531 and C II\u03bb\u03bb1036.337, 1334.532 are the best lines, as they saturate at low H I column densities (\u223c7\u00d71017 cm\u22122 ). However, they require sparsely available\ntime on telescopes in space, which are not sensitive enough to observe many 16th to 18th\nmagnitude BHB stars.\nIn the optical the strongest absorption lines are the Ca II\u03bb\u03bb3934.770, 3969.591 K and\nH lines. Previous observations of Ca II absorption in HVCs with bright 21-cm emission have\nyielded six detections, giving Ca II/H I ratios of 17\u00b16\u00d710\u22129 for complex A (Schwarz et al.\n1995), 22\u00b11\u00d710\u22129 for complex C (Wakker et al. 1996), 3.3\u00b10.9\u00d710\u22129 for complex M (Bowen\net al. 2000), 33\u00b14\u00d710\u22129 for the Magellanic Stream (Songaila & York 1981), 66\u00b18\u00d710\u22129 for\nthe Leading Arm of the Magellanic Stream (West et al. 1985) and 270\u00b1120\u00d710\u22129 for complex WB (Robertson et al. 1991). There are also several Ca II detections toward extragalactic\nsupernovae in directions with very faint or no 21-cm (d'Odorico et al. 1985, 1989; Meyer &\nRoth 1991; Vladilo et al. 1994; Ho & Filippenko 1995, 1996), which yield very high Ca II/H I\nratios. Toward IVCs Ca II/H I ratios range from 8\u00d710\u22129 to 55\u00d710\u22129 in the IV Arch, from\n12\u00d710\u22129 to 17\u00d710\u22129 in the LLIV Arch, 90\u00d710\u22129 in complex K, 50\u00d710\u22129 in the PP Arch,\nand 65\u00d710\u22129 in complex gp (Wakker 2001).\nUsing these detections of high- and intermediate-velocity absorption (as well as HVC/IVC\nabsorption in other ions, such as Fe II) Wakker & Mathis (2000) discovered that for Ca II,\nFe II, etc. the [ion]/H I ratio correlates with N(H I). The physical origin of this effect remains\nunexplained, as discussed by Wakker & Mathis (2000). For Ca II this correlation can be\nexpressed as:\nR(CaII) = N(CaII)/N(HI) = \u22120.78 ( log( N(HI) \u2212 19.5 ) ) \u2212 7.76.\nIn fact, this relation is a better predictor of the Ca II/H I ratio than the assumption that\nR(Ca II) is constant in a particular cloud. Therefore, we use this relation to convert the\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nknown H I column densities in HVCs and IVCs in the direction of a candidate target star\nto predict the Ca II equivalent width. This allows us to construct a sample of stars for each\nHVC by selecting the ones with the largest predicted equivalent widths in a set of distance\nintervals (e.g. 1\u20133 kpc, 3\u20136 kpc, 6\u20139 kpc, etc.). We have done this for sixty HVC/IVC fields.\nIn this paper we report on observation of stars in three fields, covering two HVCs and two\nIVCs.\nPrevious authors have set distance brackets or limits to HVCs/IVCs using the nominal\ndistances to stars that give upper limits and significant lower limits. However, the errors\nin the stellar distances have been ignored in the past. In this paper we take them into\naccount. Since the error distribution is centered on the nominal distance, the probability\nthat the upper limit is less than the nominal distance to the star is 50%. If the error\ndistribution of the stellar distances were gaussian, the probability that the upper limit is\nless than Dnom +0.47\u03c3(D) is 68%. Thus, the 68% (i.e. 1\u03c3) confidence interval on the upper\ndistance limit to the HVC is given by Dnom +0.47\u03c3(D). A similar reasoning provides the\nlower limit of the bracket. At present, we do not calculate the actual error distribution for\nthe distance, so for convenience we assume it is gaussian. For future work we will improve\nthis step.\n\n3.\n3.1.\n\nObservations\nStellar data\n\nFor the April-September 2006 semester we were given an allocation of 37 hours on ESO's\nVery Large Telescope (VLT) to observe 24 stars and one QSO (proposal ID 077.B-0359). For\nour observations we used the UVES spectrograph installed on the VLT together with a 1\u2032\u2032 slit\nand the blue arm (CD2). This setup provides a wavelength coverage from \u223c3730 to 4990 \u00c5,\na pixel size of 0.03 \u00c5 (\u223c2.3 km s\u22121 ), and a spectral resolution of R\u223c40,000, corresponding to\nan FWHM of \u223c7.5 km s\u22121 . During our observations the seeing typically was \u22640.\u2032\u2032 8. The raw\ndata were reduced with the standard UVES pipeline, which includes flat-fielding, bias- and\nsky-subtraction, and a relative wavelength calibration. To compare with the 21-cm data,\nthe final spectra were then shifted to an LSR velocity scale. For multiple integrations of\nthe same background source, the individual spectra were co-added, weighted by their inverse\nvariances. In the continuum the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) per resolution element in the\nUVES data typically ranges from about 40 to 100.\nThe three HVCs that we selected for our VLT observations have in common that they\nare above the horizon during the southern winter. They are the \"Cohen Stream\", \"com-\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nplex GCP\" and \"cloud g1\". Most stars in the Cohen Stream field also lie projected onto\nanother, more nearby IVC. We describe these clouds and the stars projected on them in the\nnext section. Figure 1 shows the locations of these three clouds on a map of the HVC sky.\nThe map also shows the three stars toward which HVC absorption was found previously.\nTable 1 presents the stellar data. Coordinates are defined in the names for 2MASS\nand SDSS stars, given in the notes for the remaining stars. The two \"BS\" stars are from\nthe HK survey (Beers et al. 1996) and the numbers represent plate number and star id on\nthat plate. Seventeen stars in the VLT sample have classification spectra from our APO\nobservations, one spectrum is from the SDSS (see Col. 2 of the table). We also obtained\nphotometry for most stars, with the source of the data listed in Col. 3 and the resulting\nmagnitudes in Cols. 4, 5 and 6. The extinction (from Schlegel et al. 1998) is given in Col. 7.\nFor five stars we can use SDSS photometry. For twelve stars (eleven from 2MASS, one from\nthe HK survey), we obtained this photometry ourselves. For seven stars we do not have\nphotometry data. Three of these are 2MASS stars, so we used the star's B magnitude from\nthe 2MASS catalogue. For the three named RR Lyrae stars we used the photometry listed\nin the Kukarkin et al. (1970) catalogue. Finally, Str\u00f6mgren photometry was obtained by\nMoehler et al. (1990) for PG 0142+148.\nFor all stars we give the stellar parameters derived directly from the high-resolution\nspectra, while for the 17 stars with intermediate-resolution spectroscopy we give additional\nlines showing the stellar parameters resulting from our APO data, for comparison. The\nstellar parameters are derived using the photometry, the Balmer lines, Ca II K and H and\nCa I\u03bb4227.918. A full description of this method will be given by Wilhelm et al. (2007,\nin preparation). Columns 8 to 11 list the resulting effective temperature, gravity, metallicity and stellar type, respectively. Combining the stellar parameters with photometry and\nisochrones, we can derive the star's distance, given in Col. 13 of the table.\nThe VLT data were used to derive the stellar velocities listed in Col. 12. This was done\nby fitting a gaussian to the stellar Ca II, Ca I and Fe I lines, then averaging the fitted central\nvelocities. For some of the stars the stellar velocity varies between exposures (see the notes\nto the Table). In these cases, we did not use all of the exposures, but only the ones with the\nleast confusing separation between stellar and interstellar lines. The listed velocity is valid\nfor that spectrum.\nThere are often differences in the temperature, gravity and metallicity derived from the\nVLT spectrum when compared to those values derived from the APO spectra. When the\ndifferences are more than one sigma, they are noted in the following subsection.\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\n3.2.\n\nDistance estimation\n\n3.2.1. Non-problematic stars\nFor eight stars (2MASS J014936.48+143914.6, 2MASS J021409.31+090105.3,\n2MASS J195927.29+000822.3, 2MASS J195823.36-002719.0, 2MASS J195912.00-002645.3,\n2MASS J213327.04+133026.7, 2MASS J213520.04+133045.0, BS 17578-0016), the determination of the stellar distance based on the VLT and APO spectra is the same to within 15%.\nFor four stars (2MASS J014825.88+132305.3, SDSS J014843.61+130411.5, 2MASS J195922.75+000300.0\nand 2MASS J213451.58+134017.5 the determinations differ by 20\u201340%. Since they are still\nthe same within \u223c1\u03c3, the results are still compatible, just relatively inaccurate.\nIn the case of 2MASS J213451.58+134017.5 the metallicity indicated by the Ca II K line\nis about 1 dex less than that found from spectral regions with many metallic lines (mostly\nFe). The star is probably a main-sequence star with solar abundance, so we adopt a nominal\nlog g=4.0 to derive the distance. The lower resolution of the APO data makes that result\nless reliable, so we are not worried by the \u223c1\u03c3 difference in the nominal distance.\nFor one star (2MASS J195925.49\u2212000519.1) the difference between the distance derived\nfrom the high- and the intermediate-resolution spectrum is larger than the nominal error\n(1.5\u00b10.2 kpc vs 2.6\u00b10.4). However, these values are still somewhat consistent, and this is\nnot an important star for our program to determine HVC distances. We therefore did not\ntry to correct his discrepancy.\nFor two stars (SDSS J015735.65+135254.2, and BS 17578-0015), we have no APO classification spectrum, but we do have photometry, and we are confident that the resulting\nclassifications and distances are good.\nTwo stars are too hot (i.e. T >12000 K) for our method, but distances are given in\nthe literature. These are PG 0142+148, which was analyzed by Moehler et al. (1990) and\nPG 2134+125, which is the central star of the planetary nebula NGC 7094. Phillips (2004)\nsummarizes distance determinations for planetaries, and includes NGC 7094.\n\n3.2.2. Problematic stars (non-RR Lyrae)\nFor two stars the distances derived from the VLT and APO spectra differ substantially.\nThe VLT spectrum of 2MASS J021651.34+080150.2 shows many stellar lines, which\nblend in the APO spectrum, making it difficult to determine the gravity. In addition we do\nnot have photometry for this star, so that we cannot directly fit Teff and log g (see Wilhelm et\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nal. 2007). We instead use a grid of spectral models with different temperatures and gravities,\nand find the best match. As a result of these problems, the APO spectrum suggests low\ngravity, while the VLT spectrum indicates high gravity. This leads to a dichotomy in the\nclassification; we have more confidence in the lower (VLT-based) distance.\nThe VLT spectrum of 2MASS J195741.61-004009.7 also shows many stellar lines. In\nfact, the line density is such that it explains why the APO spectrum of this star is noisy,\nmaking its analysis difficult. The determination of the star's gravity is so uncertain that the\nAPO data suggest it is a BHB, implying D11.1\u00b13.3 kpc, while the VLT spectrum indicates\na main-sequence F star at 0.7\u00b10.6 kpc. We judge that it is more likely to be nearby than\nto be distant.\n\n3.2.3. RR Lyrae stars\nThe final five stars are RR Lyrae stars, a classification based on the derived stellar parameters, but also on the fact that we can see the stellar lines shift between different VLT\nexposures. To estimate a distance for an RR Lyrae star requires a determination of its average magnitude. We usually do not have phase information, so we do not know whether\nthe VLT spectrum or the SDSS photometry was taken during maximum, minimum or somewhere between. Moreover, the magnitudes given by Kukarkin et al. (1970) for V1084 Aql,\nV1172 Aql, and FW Peg are photographic, not UBV . They are also quantized, in steps of\n\u223c0.25 magnitudes. Therefore, we use the following reasoning to estimate the distances to\nthe five RR Lyrae stars in our sample.\nWe start by looking at SDSS J015133.91+141105.2. The SDSS photometry of this\nstar gives V =16.81 (using the transformation from ugriz to UBV given by Ivezi\u0107 et al.\n2000). We have six VLT exposures of this star, taken 28 and 16 days apart, with one\nrun of four exposures in four consecutive hours. The star's flux varies between 6.2\u00d710\u221216\nerg cm\u22122 s\u22121 \u00c5\u22121 and 20.5\u00d710\u221216 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 \u00c5\u22121 , giving 13.3\u00d710\u221216 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 \u00c5\u22121 on\naverage, corresponding to V =16.14. Since the range in flux is about 1.3 magnitude, it is\nreasonable to conclude that 16.1\u00b10.2 is a good estimate for the average magnitude of this\nstar. Combined with an absolute magnitude for RR Lyraes of MV =0.7 (Layden et al. 1996)\nand extinction AV =0.16 (Schlegel et al. 1998), this implies a distance of 11.2\u00b11.0 kpc.\nThe flux of SDSS J020033.49+141153.9 varies from 10.7\u00d710\u221216 to 21.6\u00d710\u221216 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 \u00c5\u22121\nbetween the three spectra of this star. The average flux is about 16\u00d710\u221216 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 \u00c5\u22121 ,\nor V \u223c16.0. The temperature that is derived is about 6600 K, which suggests the star is in\nits cool phase. The SDSS equivalent V magnitude is 15.58. These results are compatible\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nif the SDSS observation caught it near average while the VLT observation caught it near\nminimum. Based on this, we set the average magnitude to V =15.6\u00b10.3. With AV =0.19 this\nimplies D=8.7\u00b11.3 kpc.\nFor V1084 Aql Kukarkin et al. (1970) gave <P >=17.0. Bond (1978) included this\nstar in a sample of RR Lyraes for which he obtained photometry. He finds <V >=17.0,\nwith an accuracy of about 0.2 mag. The star's flux varies from 7.4\u00d710\u221216 to 14.5\u00d710\u221216\nerg cm\u22122 s\u22121 \u00c5\u22121 in our four VLT exposures. On average this flux corresponds to V =16.35.\nWe derive a temperature of 7000 K, which suggests we observed the star near maximum\nphase, which is compatible with the relatively high flux and the relatively low number of\nstellar lines. Using AV =0.49 (Schlegel et al. 1998) then implies a distance of 14.5\u00b11.3 kpc.\nKukarkin et al. (1970) give an average magnitude for V1172 Aql of 16.5\u00b10.25. We find\nan average flux in the VLT spectra that corresponds to V =16.36. The temperature that is\nderived from the three VLT exposures is about 6500 K, suggesting we observed it in a cooler,\nfainter phase. We thus assume that the Kukarkin et al. (1970) magnitude is slightly low and\ncalculate the distance using <V >=16.4\u00b10.3, which for AV =0.60 gives D=10.5\u00b11.4 kpc.\nThe star FW Peg has <V >=14.0 in Kukarkin et al. (1970). The VLT spectrum gives\na flux corresponding to V =14.68, and a temperature of 6500 K. This is compatible if we\ncaught the star near minimum. We thus use <V >=14.0\u00b10.5 to calculate its distance. With\nAV =0.40 this gives 3.8\u00b10.8 kpc.\n\n4.\n\nMeasurements\n\nWe now summarize the measurements we made on the stars, and then discuss for each\ncloud in turn our previous knowledge, followed by a more general discussion of our results\nconcerning their distances, Ca II/H I ratios and location in the Milky Way.\n\n4.1.\n\nStellar measurements\n\nTable 2 presents the stellar data that pertain to searching for the interstellar lines. We\ngive the star's Galactic location in Cols. 2 and 3, and repeat the distance from Table 1.\nColumn 5 gives the total VLT exposure times (but see the notes to the table for exposures\nthat were excluded for the final analysis). We also determined the star's continuum flux,\nas well as the flux and S/N ratio at the velocity of the high-velocity clouds (Cols. 6, 7, 8).\nThis was done by fitting a polynomial to the line-free regions of the continuum. To calculate\nthe flux at the HVC's velocity, the stellar Ca II absorption was considered as \"continuum\",\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nsince we are interested in the flux and S/N appropriate for measuring the interstellar line\nagainst the background of the stellar flux. The order of the fitted polynomial lies between 1\nand 4. The signal-to-noise ratio is calculated per 7 km s\u22121 resolution element, i.e. calculated\nafter rebinning the spectrum to three pixels. It is the ratio of the flux to the rms of the fit\naround the line-free regions of the spectrum used in the fit. This value is compared with the\nnominal error in the flux to make sure that it is similar.\n\n4.2.\n\nH I and Ca II measurements\n\nTable 3 lists the Ca II interstellar measurements. The table contains the following\ncolumns.\nColumns 1 and 2 repeat the stellar name and distance.\nColumns 3 and 4 give the velocity and the logarithm of the H I column density of the\nHVC, IVC, or low-velocity gas in the sightline. The H I 21-cm emission data were taken\nfrom the Leiden-Argentina-Bonn Survey (LAB; Kalberla et al. 2005). This survey provides\nspectra on a 0.\u25e6 5\u00d70.\u25e6 5 grid, with a 36\u2032 beam. We calculated a weighted average of all spectra\nthat lie within 0.\u25e6 6 from each star as the best approximation to the H I spectrum toward each\nstar. To determine v(H I) and N(H I) we fitted gaussians to these spectra, using one gaussian\ncomponent for the high- or intermediate-velocity emission, and between two and four for the\nlow-velocity gas. It should be noted that the intermediate- and high-velocity components\nusually are not exactly gaussian, so the fit gives only an approximation to N(H I).\nThe uncertainty in N(H I) is dominated by the fact that the Dwingeloo telescope has\na large beam on the sky. Wakker et al. (2001) showed the value of N(H I) measured with\na 9 arcmin beam can be up to a factor of 2.5 lower or higher than the value measured\nwith a 35 arcmin beam. Further, when comparing measurements of N(H I) made with a\n9 arcmin beam with those made with a 1\u20132 arcmin beam, the latter are between 75 to\n125% of the former. The origin of these differences is clearly small-scale structure in the\ncloud, including edge effects if the beam is near a cloud's edge. The distribution of the ratio\nN(H I,real)/N(H I,LAB) has an average of about 1, and an rms of about 0.2. As a result, we\nassume a 20% error for N(H I) when calculating Ca II/H I ratios. Ideally, we would like to\nobtain high-resolution (1 arcmin or better) H I 21-cm data toward each of our targets, but\nwe do not have such data at this time. Even then, there is always the possibility of a hole in\nthe distribution of the H I in the direction of the star, and a non-detection would still not\nimply that the star lies in front of the HVC. However, we use to the apparent hierarchical\nstructure of the H I in HVCs (see Schwarz & Wakker 2004) to argue that it is possible to\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\naccount for the uncertainty in N(H I) by using a \"safety factor\", as described below under\nthe discussion of Col. 13.\nColumns 5 and 6 give the predicted K (Col. 5) and H (Col. 6) equivalent widths. These\nare derived from a predicted Ca II column density, combined with the observed linewidth\nof the H I emission. The prediction for the column density is derived from the correlation between N(Ca II) and N(H I) discovered by Wakker & Mathis (2000), but with a\ncloud-dependent correction factor. The correction factor is found by comparing the nominal\nprediction (given a value of N(H I)) for the Ca II/H I ratio with the actual observed value,\nand then averaging the resulting quotient between all detections found for each cloud. We\nwill discuss the correction factors in Sect. 4, but note here that the quotient of nominal\nprediction and actual value tends to be a constant value in a particular cloud, though it\nvaries between clouds.\nColumns 7 and 8 list the measured K and H line equivalent width detections or 3-\u03c3\nlimits. For detections the absorption lines were integrated over the range of velocities where\nthe flux lies below the continuum, which is 20\u201325 km s\u22121 wide for the Cohen Stream, the\nIVC projected onto the Cohen Stream, and for complex GCP, and about 40 km s\u22121 wide for\ncloud g1. The equivalent width limits for non-detections were determined by integrating the\nspectrum over a 20 km s\u22121 velocity range, and setting the upper limit to three times the one\nsigma error in the equivalent width. The equivalent width error includes the uncertainty\nassociated with the noise, as well as the uncertainty associated with continuum placement.\nIn Cols. 9 and 10 we give the Ca II column density derived by integrating the apparent\noptical depth profile (Savage & Sembach 1991):\nZ\nme c\nC(v)\nN = Na (v)dv =\nf\n\u03bb\nln\n,\n\u03c0e2\nF (v)\nwhere C(v) is the continuum and F (v) the observed flux.\nThe resulting column densities are divided by N(H I), giving the values in Cols. 11 and\n12. We note that the error in the Ca II/H I ratio is calculated using the observed error in\nthe Ca II column density combined with an assumed 20% error in N(H I).\nColumn 13 shows the final result derived from each star: an \"U\" if the star yields an\nupper distance limit, an \"L\" if it gives a lower limit and a blank if the S/N ratio was insufficient to derive a lower limit from a non-detection. The significance of the non-detections is\nobtained by comparing the expected value (Cols. 5 and 6) with the 3\u03c3 upper limits (Cols. 7\nand 8). As discussed by Wakker (2001), a safety factor needs to be taken into account for\nsuch a comparison, since we do not precisely know the H I column density (see discussion of\nCol. 4 above) and the Ca II/H I ratio in the cloud may in principle vary due to variations in\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\ncalcium depletion and ionization conditions. We assume a factor \u223c1.5 for the uncertainty\nin N(H I) and another factor \u223c2 for the uncertainty in the Ca abundance. Only if the ratio\nEW(expected)/\u03c3(EW) is >9 do we conclude that a non-detection sets a lower limit to the\ncloud's distance.\n\n4.3.\n\nCalculation of masses and mass flow rates\n\nAfter we determine the distance to a cloud, we can estimate its location in the Milky\nWay, its mass, and the mass flow rate associated with it. These numbers are summarized in\nTable 4.\nWe estimate the mass in the manner described by Wakker & van Woerden (1991). In\nsummary, we find the values of TB for each point in the cloud that were given by Hulsbosch\n& Wakker (1988). Converting TB to a column density (using the linewidth), and then\nmultiplying by the area (in cm\u22122 ) represented by one survey grid cell (about one square\ndegree) gives the H I mass in the grid cell. Integrating over the cloud gives the total mass,\ngiven an assumed distance, D. This value scales as D 2 .\nWe use the Hulsbosch & Wakker (1988) dataset instead of the newer LAB data from\nKalberla et al. (2005), because in the latter we have to select a fixed velocity range, so\nthere can be blending with lower-velocity gas. Also, the cloud edges need to be defined\nby polygons. The older survey clearly separates any particular HVCs from other gas. An\nimproved list could be constructed from the LAB survey, but this has not yet been done.\nWhere possible we do check the Hulsbosch & Wakker (1988) cloud masses against a rough\nestimate using the LAB survey, and find that they are similar to about 25%.\nTo derive the mass flow rate, we need to estimate a vertical velocity for each survey\ngrid cell. Given the observed LSR velocity, we calculate the \"deviation velocity\" (vDEV ),\nthe amount by which the cloud's velocity differs from the maximum velocity that can be\nunderstood from a simple model of differential galactic rotation (see Wakker 1991). This\nsimple model consists of a disk with radius 26 kpc with thickness 4 kpc inside the solar circle\n(8.5 kpc) increasing to 12 kpc at 26 kpc. The rotation curve is flat, except in the inner\n0.5 kpc where solid-body rotation is assumed. Using the deviation velocity we estimate\nthe cloud's z-velocity (vz ) by assuming that it is purely vertical or by assuming that it is\npurely radial with respect to the Sun. In the former case, vz =vDEV /sin b, while in the latter\nvz =vDEV sin b. To estimate the mass flow, we take the average of these two possibilities.\nDividing the cloud's distance by the estimated vertical velocity yields the time it will take\nfor the cloud to reach the Galactic plane. Finally, the quotient of cloud mass and travel time\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\ngives the mass flow associated with the cloud. The resulting number scales as D.\n\n4.4.\n\nIonized hydrogen\n\nTo fully understand the clouds and estimate the mass flows associated with them, we\nalso need to estimate the amount of ionized hydrogen. It turns out that H\u03b1 data exists for\neach of our clouds. There are a number of single pointings for complex GCP and the Cohen\nStream, and there are maps from the Wisconsin H\u03b1 Mapper (WHAM) northern sky survey\n(Haffner et al. 2003) for cloud g1 and the Cohen Stream field IVC. We will describe these\ndata when discussing each cloud.\nSince we know the cloud distances, we can use the H\u03b1 data to estimate the amount of\nionized hydrogen in our clouds. There are two ways to do this. In both cases we assume that\nN(H+ ) is constant, which is justified if the ionization is due to photons from the Galactic\ndisk: hydrogen ionization continues until all Lyman continuum photons have been soaked up.\nThen, we can first assume that the ionized hydrogen is distributed throughout the cloud, in\nwhich case the cloud thickness we use to convert the emission measure to a density is similar\nto its width on the sky. We can also assume that all the ionized hydrogen sits on the surface\nof the cloud, and the cloud's density is constant, i.e. we use n(H+ )=n(H I) and calculate\nthe emission length from the emission measure. Both these methods are used to derive the\nnumbers presented in Table 4.\n\n5.\n5.1.\n\nResults\n\nCohen Stream\n\n5.1.1. Distance\nThe first cloud we observed is part of the so-called \"Cohen Stream\", discovered by\nCohen (1981) (although he only observed the part of the stream that lies to the east of\nour stars). This HVC is a rather linear stream of gas that runs from (l,b)\u223c(175\u25e6 ,\u221230\u25e6 ) to\n(l,b)\u223c(140\u25e6 ,\u221252\u25e6 ), with velocities of vLSR \u223c\u2212110 km s\u22121 . It lies in a part of the sky where the\nmaximum velocity expected from differential galactic rotation is \u221215 km s\u22121 . A partial map\nof the cloud is given in Fig. 2. On its eastern end (l>156\u25e6 ) it overlaps with a bright HVC\nat vLSR =\u2212280 km s\u22121 , also discovered by Cohen (1981), and named WW 507 by Wakker &\nvan Woerden (1991). It is still unclear whether these two HVCs are related or whether they\nare a chance coincidence. Unfortunately, the footprint of the SDSS does not overlap the\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\nWW 507 cloud, so we do not (yet) know distant stars in its direction. We return to this\npoint in Sect. 5.1.5.\nWe obtained VLT-UVES spectra for nine stars and one QSO in the direction of the\nCohen Stream, shown in Fig. 7. Seven of these objects lie in the direction of the small\ncore at the end of the Stream (cloud WW 516 in Wakker & van Woerden 1991), three lie\nprojected onto its main body (cloud WW 517). As we discuss below, and as can be seen in\nFig. 7 and Table 3, we detect high-velocity interstellar Ca II H and K absorption toward\nthe QSO SDSS J014631.99+133506.3 as well as the K line toward the 11.2\u00b11.0 kpc distant RR Lyrae star SDSS J015133.91+141105.2. The most distant star toward which we do\nnot detect the HVC at a significant level is the BHB star 2MASSJ014936.48+143914.63 at\n4.6\u00b10.8 kpc. Ca II is also not detected toward SDSS 014843.61+130411.5 (D=5.0\u00b11.2 kpc)\nand SDSS 020033.50+141154.0 (D=8.7\u00b11.3 kpc). The first of these is not significant, although just barely so, while for the latter the ratio expected/observed equivalent width is\nonly 1. Taking into account the errors on the star's distances, these results imply a distance\nbracket of 5.0 to 11.7 kpc for the Cohen Stream. If we relax the criterion for a significant\nnon-detection, we could improve the lower limit to 5.6 kpc.\n\n5.1.2. Discussion of stars\n1) SDSS J015133.91+141105.2 is the star that sets the upper limit on the distance.\nThe HVC K line is clearly seen in absorption in its spectrum, with an equivalent width\nof 17\u00b13 m\u00c5. This low-metallicity ([Fe/H]=\u22121.73\u00b10.3) AV star shows relatively few stellar\nlines, and with its velocity of \u2212176 km s\u22121 , the stellar Ca II and Fe I\u03bb3931.409 lines are shifted\nwell away from the HVC. The expected equivalent width of the H line is 10 m\u00c5, far below\nthe 34 m\u00c5 detection limit. This detection limit is rather high because the stellar H\u01eb line\nsubstantially reduces the star's flux at the velocity of the HVC (13.2\u00d710\u221216 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 \u00c5\u22121\nat Ca II K, 3.5\u00d710\u221216 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 \u00c5\u22121 at Ca II H). Thus, we cannot use the H-line to confirm\nthe K-line detection. However, we have seven exposures of this star, taken on August 10,\nSeptember 7 (2 exposures) and September 23 (4 exposures one hour apart). These show\nthe stellar velocity varying over time: v(*)=\u2212194\u00b13 km s\u22121 on August 10, \u2212138 km s\u22121 on\nSeptember 7, and \u2212178, \u2212193, \u2212193 and \u2212190 km s\u22121 on September 23. From these spectra\nit is clear that the feature at vLSR =\u2212104 km s\u22121 is interstellar, as it stays at the same\nposition, whereas the stellar lines vary. In order to have a clean continuum against which\nthe HVC absorption can be measured, we combined only the first and last exposure, which\nhave the cleanest separation between stellar and interstellar absorption.\n2) Toward the QSO SDSS J014631.99+133506.3 the high-velocity cloud's K and H equiv-\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\nalent widths are 17\u00b13 and 11\u00b13 m\u00c5, respectively. The Ca II/H I ratio implied by the K-line\nis about half the value found toward the star SDSS J15133.91+141105.2. They differ at the\n2\u03c3 level, but this can easily be explained by the large uncertainty in the value of N(H I)\ntoward the two targets. On the other hand, the equivalent widths of the K and H lines seen\ntoward the QSO are in the expected ratio of about two, giving confidence in the detections.\n3) Using the method described in Sect. 2, we predict K and H equivalent widths of 17\nand 8 m\u00c5 toward the 30.4\u00b13.9 kpc distant BHB star SDSS J015735.65+135254.2. In its\nspectrum we find a possible HVC K absorption of 10\u00b13 m\u00c5. Since it is just a 3\u03c3 feature we\ndo not claim this as a clear detection of the HVC, but the feature is compatible with the\nexpectations.\n4) Toward the star 2MASSJ 01449.36.48+143914.6 (D=4.6\u00b10.8 kpc) the ratio of expected Ca II K equivalent width (21 m\u00c5) to the observed error (2.9 m\u00c5) is 7.2, which\nimplies that this star sets a lower distance limit to the distance of the HVC.\n5) The HVC is also not seen in absorption toward the other six stars with D<10 kpc.\nToward most of these stars the H I column density is low, and only the non-detections toward\nthe four nearest stars are significant.\n\n5.1.3. Ca II/H I ratio\nThe Ca II/H I ratio that we find for the Cohen Stream is on the low end of those found\nfor HVCs: 11.7\u00b12.9\u00d710\u22129 toward SDSS J015133.91+141105.2 and 6.8\u00b12.0\u00d710\u22129 toward\nSDSS J014631.99+133506.3. The Ca II/H I ratios predicted by the Wakker & Mathis (2000)\ncorrelation are 27\u00d710\u22129 and 17\u00d710\u22129 , respectively. The ratio of observed to expected values\nthus is 0.42\u00b10.05, i.e. the Cohen Stream appears to be relatively underabundant by a factor\nof \u223c2.4 in gaseous ionized calcium. However, until we have a measurement of the metallicity\nof the Cohen Stream, it will remain unclear whether this underabundance is due to low\nmetallicity, unusually high calcium ionization or high depletion of calcium onto dust, or even\nsmall-scale structure in the H I, which affects our estimate of N(H I).\n\n5.1.4. Location in the Milky Way\nPrevious assessments of the distance of the Cohen Stream were summarized by Wakker\n(2001): Kemp et al. (1994) and Tamanaha (1996) observed Mg II, Ca II and Na I in bright\nstars in the direction of the Cohen Stream, at distances up to 300 pc, but no absorption\nwas found. Based on a morphological study of the high-, intermediate- and low-velocity gas,\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\nTamanaha (1995) argued that the Cohen Stream is the remnant of a collision between the\nWW 507 cloud and low-velocity gas, which would place it within about 1 kpc from the disk.\nOur distance bracket excludes such a simple interaction model, as the cloud is clearly more\ndistant than 9.2 kpc.\nIt is now clear that this cloud is rather far below the Galactic plane, having z between\n3.7 and 8.6 kpc (see Table 4). It is located at similar longitude, but on the opposite side\nof the plane and further inward than the Galactic warp (which is at galactocentric radii\nbetween about 17 and 22 kpc \u2013 Burton & te Lintel Hekkert 1986).\n\n5.1.5. Ionized hydrogen\nWeiner et al. (2001) reported H\u03b1 emission from two directions in the Anti Center region. One of these is at (l,b)= (164\u25e6 ,\u221246\u25e6 ) and samples the Cohen Stream (Weiner, priv.\ncomm.). The H\u03b1 intensity (I(H\u03b1)) is 0.07\u00b10.01 Rayleigh. [One Rayleigh (R) is 106 /4\u03c0\nR\nphotons cm\u22122 s\u22121 sr\u22121 ; the emission measure (EM= n2e L) is related to this as EM=2.75\nT40.924 I(H\u03b1), where T4 is the gas temperature in units of 104 K].\nThe H+ column density we derive from the observed H\u03b1 emission is on the order of\n1019 cm\u22122 , independent of most assumptions. The H+ mass is found to be similar to the H I\nmass, which is a few 105 M\u2299 . If we assume the H+ is located in a layer around the neutral\ncloud, the implied skin thickness is 10 to 25% of the total cloud thickness.\nWe noted earlier that H\u03b1 emission was also detected from the higher-velocity cloud\nnear the Cohen Stream (Kutyrev & Reynolds 1989; Weiner et al. 2001), with an intensity\nof \u223c0.08 R. This cloud is centered around l=168\u25e6 , b=\u221246\u25e6 , vLSR =\u2212280 km s\u22121 . Using\nthe Bland-Hawthorn & Maloney (1999) model of the Galactic ionizing radiation field, the\nH\u03b1 brightness of this cloud would imply a distance on the order of 15 kpc. If such an\ninterpretation for the H\u03b1 emission can be maintained, this would suggest that this cloud\nand the Cohen Stream are close together in space, even though their velocities differ by\n170 km s\u22121 .\n\n5.2.\n\nHigh-z Perseus Arm IVC\n5.2.1. Distance\n\nIn the sightlines to the Cohen Stream an IVC is also visible in the H I spectra, with\nvelocities of \u223c\u221240 to \u221260 km s\u22121 . This IVC is part of an extended region of intermediate-\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\nvelocity gas, a map of which can be found in Wakker (2001; Fig. 18), who named this gas\n\"IV-south\". Figure 3 shows the H I with vLSR between \u221280 and \u221230 km s\u22121 . In the general\nvicinity of this IVC differential galactic rotation contributes substantially to the observed\nradial velocity (up to \u221215 km s\u22121 at b=\u221250\u25e6 , up to \u221245 km s\u22121 at b=\u221225\u25e6 ). Therefore, we\npresent in Fig. 4 the H I column density for deviation velocities between \u221260 and \u221230 km s\u22121 ,\ni.e. gas parcels whose velocities are 30 to 60 km s\u22121 more negative from the maximum radial\nvelocity expected from differential galactic rotation. This clearly shows the IVC centered\nnear (l,b)=(145\u25e6 ,\u221242\u25e6 ). The stellar spectra for targets projected onto the IVC can be seen\nin Fig. 7. The stream running from (l,b)\u223c(130\u25e6 ,\u221260\u25e6 ) to (l,b)\u223c(100\u25e6 ,\u221247\u25e6 ) was termed the\n\"Pegasus-Pisces Arch\" or PP-Arch by Wakker (2001), and its distance is <2.7 kpc.\nIntermediate-velocity absorption is clearly detected toward the QSO and in the spectra of all stars more distant than 2.1 kpc, but not toward PG 0142+148 (D=1.2\u00b10.5kpc),\nwhere the ratio EW(expected)/\u03c3(EW) is 12.7. Taking into account the errors on the stellar\ndistances, the implied distance bracket is 1.0 to 2.7 kpc.\n\n5.2.2. Ca II/H I ratio\nFor this IVC the observed Ca II/H I ratios range from 10\u00b13\u00d710\u22129 toward\n2MASS J014936.48+143914.6 to 30\u00b19 toward SDSS J015735.65+135254.2. Much of this\nrange might be due to the uncertainty in the H I column densities toward the stars. The\nratio of observed to predicted Ca II/H I ratio is on average 0.62\u00b10.11, ranging from 0.41 to\n0.75. Thus, like the Cohen Stream, this gas also seems to be deficient in ionized calcium\ncompared to the ratio N(Ca II)/N(H I) for HVCs in general, but we do not have enough\ninformation to determine the cause of this.\n\n5.2.3. Location in the Milky Way\nThe IVC lies below the Perseus Arm, the next spiral arm out from the Local arm. In\nthe Galactic plane, the Perseus spiral arm has velocities of about \u221250 km s\u22121 . The distance\nto the Perseus arm is about 2.5\u00b10.5 kpc (see Reynolds et al. 1995 and references therein).\nHaffner et al. (2005) studied the H\u03b1 emission from the high-z extension of the Perseus Arm\nand find it has a scaleheight of about 1 kpc. Associated gas at b=\u221245\u25e6 would be at a distance\nof 3.6\u00b10.7 kpc and lie 2.5\u00b10.5 kpc below the Galactic plane. A z-height of 1 kpc implies a\ndistance of 1.6 kpc, in which case the cloud would be located in the interarm region. Gas\nnear the upper distance limit of 2.7 kpc would have z=1.9 kpc. So, the IVC we see is likely\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\nassociated with the front side of the high-z extension of the Perseus Arm.\nFor this direction, the LSR velocity predicted from differential galactic rotation is\n\u223c\u221225 km s\u22121 , suggesting that the IVC has a peculiar velocity toward the plane of between 15\nand 35 km s\u22121 . The derived distance bracket is not very precise, but it is clearly compatible\nwith the idea that this IVC is associated with the Perseus Arm. This could be confirmed by\nobtaining spectra with high S/N ratio of additional stars in the 1 to 3 kpc range.\nTo estimate the cloud's H I mass we integrated the column densities between l\u223c139\u25e6 to\n155\u25e6 , b\u223c\u221247\u25e6 to \u221240\u25e6 . The cloud's total mass is found to be in the range 0.2\u20131.4\u00d7104 M\u2299 .\nWe note that this is of the same order of magnitude as the \"Intermediate-Velocity Arch\"\n(IV-Arch), the largest northern IVC (see Kuntz & Danly 1996; Wakker 2001, 2004), which\nalso is moving toward the Galactic plane with a velocity of \u223c40 km s\u22121 . It is also similar\nto the mass of the \"Low-Latitude Intermediate-Velocity Arch\" (LLIV Arch), an IVC that\nis 0.9\u20131.8 kpc distant with a mass of 1.5\u00d7105 M\u2299 . The latter IVC appears to be in the\ninterarm region. The IVC we detected in absorption may be a cloud similar to the IV and\nLLIV Arches, but associated with the Perseus Arm, rather than with the Local spiral arm.\n\n5.2.4. Ionized hydrogen\nIn the WHAM H\u03b1 survey (Haffner et al. 2005), there is no detectable H\u03b1 emission from\nthe area covered by this cloud, which corresponds to a 3\u03c3 upper limit of I(H\u03b1)<0.15 R, or\nan emission measure <0.07 cm\u22126 pc. The implied H+ column density limit of \u223c1019 cm\u22122 is\ncompatible with the values found for the other clouds. so the non-detection does not imply\na lack of ionized hydrogen for this object.\nThe non-detection does imply that for this cloud the mass of ionized gas is smaller than\nthe neutral hydrogen mass. If the ionized gas is on a skin, this skin is relatively thin, being\nat most 10% of the cloud's thickness.\n\n5.3.\n\nHVC complex GCP or HVC 40\u221215+100\n5.3.1. Distance\n\nThe second HVC in our sample lies near l=40\u25e6 , b=\u221215\u25e6 and has vLSR \u223c90 km s\u22121 . It\nhas been referred to as the \"Smith Cloud\", after Smith (1963), who discovered it, or as\nHVC 40\u221215+100, or as complex GCP (Wakker & van Woerden 1991). Wakker (2001) could\nonly set a lower distance limit of 0.3 kpc, from the non-detection of Ca II absorption toward\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\nsome nearby stars.\nWe observed eight stars projected on complex GCP (see Fig. 5), six of which were found\nfrom the 2MASS survey; the other two are RR Lyraes from the Kukarkin (1970) catalogue.\nThe Ca II absorption and H I emission spectra are shown in Fig. 8. We detect the HVC in the\nspectrum of V1084 Aql, located at 14.5\u00b11.3 kpc, but not toward V1172 Aql at 10.5\u00b11.3 kpc,\nyielding a distance bracket of 9.8 to 15.1 kpc.\n\n5.3.2. Discussion of stars\n1) Figure 8 shows the HVC absorption in the V1084 Aql K-line, which has an equivalent\nwidth of 51\u00b13 m\u00c5. We caught this low-metallicity ([Fe/H]=\u22121.22\u00b10.25) RR Lyrae star at\na temperature of about 7000 K, and the spectrum shows relatively few stellar lines. The\nCa II H-line detection is less clear (37\u00b110 m\u00c5), not only because it is confused by the stellar\nH\u01eb line, but also because the H\u01eb lines makes the flux much lower at the HVC's velocity\n(8.5\u00d710\u221216 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 \u00c5\u22121 at K, 1.5\u00d710\u221216 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 \u00c5\u22121 at H).\n2) The HVC is absent in the spectrum of V1172 Aql (D=10.5\u00b11.4 kpc), and the ratio\nexpected/error is 15.5 for Ca II K, 7.1 for Ca II H. This star thus yields a lower limit for the\nHVC's distance. We note that the spectrum of V1172 Aql shows weak (\u223c25 m\u00c5) wiggles at\nthe velocity of the HVC in both the K and the H line, but these features don't match up as\ninterstellar Ca II \u2013 they are not at exactly the same velocity, and they are not in the ratio\n2:1.\n3) One other star has a large distance (2MASS J195922.75+000300.0 at 9.0\u00b13.7 kpc),\nbut it has low UV flux as it is a cool star (Teff =5750 K), so the non-detection is not significant.\n4) The remaining four stars all have distances less than 2 kpc. The non-detections of\ninterstellar Ca II K toward 2MASS J195927.29+000822.3 and 2MASS J195912.00\u2212002645.3\nare significant, but for 2MASS J195741.61\u2212004009.7 and 2MASSJ 195925.49\u2212000519.1 this\nis not the case. Considering the distance bracket we have set, these non-detections are not\nunexpected since these stars are relatively nearby.\n5) Finally, one star in our sample is at about the same distance as V1084 Aql:\n2MASS J195823.36\u2212002719.0, at D=13.1\u00b13.2 kpc. The 2MASS catalogue gives a J magnitude of 15.1 for this star, but our photometry (Wilhelm et al. 2007) yields V =16.9. Since we\nexpected the star to be bright (and originally estimated a distance of 5.8 kpc), we only requested a short exposure time (7200 sec). Even less data was actually obtained (2665 sec), so\nthe spectrum has an S/N ratio of only 5 at the location of the interstellar K line. Therefore,\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\nthe non-detection is not significant (61 m\u00c5 expected, 3\u03c3 upper limit 67 mA).\n\n5.3.3. Ca II/H I ratio\nWeighing the K line twice as much as the H line, the average Ca II/H I ratio in complex GCP that we find from the K and H line detected toward V1084 Aql is 6.2\u00b11.7\u00d710\u22129 .\nIf we estimate EW(K) from the Wakker & Mathis (2000) relation between log R(Ca II) and\nlog N(H I), we predict R(Ca II)\u223c6\u00d710\u22129 for complex GCP. Thus, the Ca II/H I ratio is\nexactly what is expected.\n\n5.3.4. Location in the Milky Way\nWe place complex GCP at a distance of 9.8 to 15.1 kpc, which puts it at a galactocentric\nradius between 6.2 and 9.7 kpc, and 2.5 to 3.9 kpc below the plane. Its 2\u25e6 \u00d78\u25e6 size on the\nsky implies a linear size of about 0.5\u00d71.8 kpc. The H I mass is about 106 M\u2299 .\nBland-Hawthorn et al. (1998) suggested that this HVC is related to the Sagittarius\ndwarf, at a distance of 26\u00b14 kpc (R=20 kpc, z=\u22127 kpc). We find that instead of lying\non the outskirts of the Milky Way, this HVC is near the solar circle, only halfway to the\nSagittarius dwarf. Only a detailed model of the dwarf galaxy's orbit can tell whether the\nHVC could be related after all.\nIn the direction of complex GCP differential galactic rotation can explain a velocity of\nup to +75 km s\u22121 , which occurs at the tangent point (D=7 kpc, at galactocentric radius\n5.5 kpc, 2.0 kpc below the plane). At distances of 9.8 and 15.1 kpc, gas in differential\nrotation has an LSR velocity of +50 and \u221217 km s\u22121 , respectively. It is therefore clear that\ncomplex GCP is below the Galactic plane and moving ahead of the gas in the plane with\na velocity of 40 to 105 km s\u22121 . Heroux et al. (in preparation) mapped this HVC using the\nnew Green-Bank Telescope. They are working on a model of its orbit, including drag forces\nto explain the stretching that is obvious in the sky map (Fig. 5).\n\n5.3.5. Ionized hydrogen\nBland-Hawthorn et al. (1998) based their suggested association with the Sagittarius\ndwarf on the detected H\u03b1 emission from this HVC, with intensities 0.24 R at (l,b)=(40\u25e6 ,\u221215\u25e6 )\nand 0.30 R at (l,b)=(41\u25e6 ,\u221214\u25e6 ). If we assume that the cloud's thickness is comparable to\n\n\f\u2013 23 \u2013\nthe width of its short dimension (0.3\u20130.5 kpc), these emission measures imply an electron\ndensity ne of 0.04\u20130.03 cm\u22123 , about 25% of the implied H I density of 0.16\u20130.10 cm\u22123 . In\nthat case the H+ mass is similar to the cloud's H I mass. If on the other hand we assume the\nH+ occurs around the outside of the cloud, the ionized mass is about a third of the neutral\nmass, while the skin is about 10% of the thickness of the cloud. In either case it is clear that\nthis cloud must have a substantial ionized component. Now that we know its location, a full\nH\u03b1 map would clearly help understand the Galactic ionizing radiation field.\n\n5.4.\n\nCloud g1\n\n5.4.1. Distance\nThe last cloud in our sample is an IVC near (l,b)=(67\u25e6 ,\u221227\u25e6 ), at vLSR \u223c+70 km s\u22121\n(Fig. 6). It is one of a set of faint positive-velocity IVCs in the region l=30\u25e6 to 70\u25e6 , b=\u221245\u25e6\nto \u221220\u25e6 that Wakker (2001) termed \"complex gp\". For the present project we have designated some of the cores in this complex as g1 through g5, with the IVC toward which we\nobserved stars termed \"cloud g1\". It is, a-priori, unclear whether these IVCs are related to\ncomplex GCP, which lies near the IVCs, though at much higher positive velocity.\nMany stars projected onto cloud g1 have previously been observed. It was detected in\nCa II and Na I absorption toward several stars in M 15 (D=10 kpc; Cohen 1979; Songaila\n& York 1981; Kennedy et al. 1998; Lehner et al. 1999). Intermediate-velocity absorption at\nthe same velocity as cloud g1 was also seen toward the star HD 203664 (D=4.3\u00b10.4 kpc;\nAlbert et al. 1993; Little et al. 1994; Ryans et al. 1996), which lies three degrees west of the\nmain cloud core (see Fig. 6). Absorption is not detected toward HD 203699 (D=0.8\u00b10.1 kpc;\nKennedy et al. 1998), nor toward several A and F stars at distances between 0.2 and 1.4 kpc\n(Smoker et al. 2001). The non-detections in the latter paper are usually not significant by our\ncriteria, except maybe for their star #7, an A2V star at a distance of 1.4 kpc. Together, these\ndetections and non-detections bracketed the distance of g1 as 0.7 (maybe 1.4) to 4.5 kpc,\nwith the caveat that these stars do not lie near the brighter part of the cloud, but probe the\ndiffuse distribution of gas with similar velocities.\nSmoker et al. (2002) made a detailed study of the part the cloud that lies in front of\nM 15. They combined high angular resolution (1\u2032 \u00d72\u2032 ) H I (Westerbork+Arecibo) data with\nWHAM H\u03b1 profiles and an IRAS map of the region. They found that the H I has structure\non scales of 5 arcmin (1.5 D[kpc] pc), and that the gas is warm (\u223c500 K).\nWe observed seven stars projected onto the main core of cloud g1, with distances ranging from 1.2 to 8.2 kpc. Since these stars are relatively nearby, the spectra have rela-\n\n\f\u2013 24 \u2013\ntively high S/N ratios. Absorption is seen toward three stars: 2MASS J213327.04+133026.7\n(D=8.2\u00b10.9 kpc), FW Peg (D=3.8\u00b10.8 kpc) and BS 17578-0016 (D=3.6\u00b10.5) while significant non-detections are obtained toward the other four stars (ratios of expected EW to upper\nlimit of 25 to 60 for Ca II K). The most distant of these is PG 2134+125 at 2.2\u00b10.8 kpc.\nUsing the 1\u03c3 range allowed by the stellar distances, the distance of cloud g1 is then bracketed\nas 1.8 to 3.8 kpc. This is a range of 2 kpc, tightening the previous 3.8 kpc wide bracket.\nUnfortunately, the current distance bracket still means that the derived cloud parameters\nwill have an uncertainty of a factor 2 to 4 (depending on how they scale with distance).\n\n5.4.2. Discussion of stars\n1) As Fig. 9 shows, the four non-detections toward BS17578-0015, 2MASS J213520.04+133045.0\n2MASS J213451.58+134017.5, and PG 2134+125 are very clear. The spectra show no stellar\nlines near the HVC velocity, and the stellar Ca II K, H and H\u01eb lines are not interfering.\n2) The detection toward FW Peg is simple and certain: the Ca II K and H absorption\nlines have equivalent width ratio two, to within the errors. The stellar velocity of \u2212225 km s\u22121\nshifts the stellar Ca II K nicely out of the way. Further, we have two spectra of this star (taken\n16 days apart) in which the stellar lines clearly shift in velocity, but the lines interpreted\nas interstellar do not. A few (unidentified) stellar lines can be seen toward more positive\nvelocities than the IVC absorption, but they do not confuse the issue.\n3) The detection toward 2MASS J213327.04+133026.7 is not as clean as the one toward\nFW Peg, but the line is obviously interstellar, since the spectrum shows no stellar lines other\nthan Ca II K, H and H\u01eb. However, the H\u01eb line is very broad and deep, lowering the flux near\nthe velocity of the interstellar absorption and making the detection of Ca II H more noisy.\n4) The most problematic star is BS 17578-0016. Both the H I 21-cm profile and the\nCa II absorption lines show two narrow components, separated at the velocity where the H I\nin g1 usually peaks. This actually gives confidence in the interpretation of the absorption\nas associated with g1, but it makes the measurements more difficult. In Table 3 we list the\nabsorption as two separate components.\n\n5.4.3. Ca II/H I ratio\nAs summarized by Wakker (2001), Lehner et al. (1999) detected Ca II in cloud g1 toward 13 stars in M 15. Using values of N(H I) between 42 and 54\u00d71018 cm\u22122 for these\nstars gives Ca II/H I ratios between 14\u00d710\u22129 and 79\u00d710\u22129 , averaging to 35\u00d710\u22129 , al-\n\n\f\u2013 25 \u2013\nthough individual measurements have large errors. Toward HD 203664 Ryans et al. (1996)\nderived a Ca II/H I ratio of 450\u00b140\u00d710\u22129 (for N(H I)=2.2\u00d71018 cm\u22122 ). For the three\nstars toward which we detect cloud g1 we find values of 106\u00b122\u00d710\u22129 (FW Peg), 63\u00b11610\u22129\n(2MASS J213327.04+133026.7), 109\u00b128\u00d710\u22129 (BS 17578-0016, stronger H I component) and\n510\u00b1110\u00d710\u22129 (BS 17578-0016, weaker H I component). Using the Wakker & Mathis (2000)\nrelation, we would predict Ca II/H I ratios of 11\u00d710\u22129 for the stars in M 15, 140\u00d710\u22129 toward HD 203664, and 28\u00d710\u22129 , 35\u00d710\u22129 , 103\u00d710\u22129 and 225\u00d710\u22129 for our detections. The\nratio of predicted to observed Ca II/H I ratio thus varies from 1.1 for one of the BS 175780016 components, to 3.8 for FW Peg. However, the H I column densities are comparatively\nuncertain, since the cloud is known to have structure on much smaller scales than the 36\u2032\nDwingeloo beam (Smoker et al. 2002). So, a proper measurement of the Ca II/H I ratios\nin cloud g1 will require H I observations with much higher resolution toward each of the\nstellar targets. Nevertheless, it appears that the Ca II/H I ratio is higher than average in\ncloud g1. Further, the apparently extremely high Ca II/H I ratios for the weak components\ntoward BS 17578-0016 are in line with the values expected from the Wakker & Mathis (2000)\nrelation.\n\n5.4.4. Location in the Milky Way\nThe distance bracket of 1.8\u20133.8 kpc for cloud g1 places it at a galactocentric radius\nof \u223c7.9 kpc and z=\u22120.8 to \u22121.7 kpc, moving with v=55 km s\u22121 relative to co-rotating\nGalactic gas around it. The ranges in the implied galactocentric radius and peculiar velocity\nare small because g1 lies near the tangent point. Its height below the plane is typical for an\nIVC. However, unlike the large Intermediate-Velocity Arch in the northern sky, this gas is\nmoving away from the plane with an estimated velocity of about 25 km s\u22121 .\nThe area of the core of the cloud is only about 2\u25e6 \u00d72\u25e6 , which translates to a size of\n(60\u2013130)2 pc. The H I mass is only about 1000\u20134000 M\u2299 . The neutral part of this cloud is\nthus clearly fairly small.\n\n5.4.5. Ionized hydrogen\nSmoker et al. (2002) reported H\u03b1 emission from cloud g1 toward three directions that lie\nprojected onto the areas with the brightest H I emission. These detections were taken from\nthe WHAM northern sky survey (Haffner et al. 2003). The H\u03b1 intensity does not vary much\n(the detections are 1.30\u00b10.04 R, 0.95\u00b10.04 R and 0.91\u00b10.03 R), whereas the H I column\n\n\f\u2013 26 \u2013\ndensities have a range of a factor 3 for these directions. This result supports the contention\nthat for many HVCs/IVCs I(H\u03b1) will be relatively constant across the face of the cloud,\nand not correlated with N(H I). With our distance bracket for this cloud, the bright H\u03b1\nintensities imply either a relatively large H+ volume density (\u223c0.17 cm\u22123 ) or a large ionized\npathlength (several hundred pc). With either of our assumptions, M(H+ ) is much larger\nthan M(H I), by at factor 5 to 10. It is clear that what we call cloud g1 is a small neutral\ncondensation in a much larger region of ionized gas.\n\n5.5.\n\nLow-velocity gas\n\nLow-velocity Ca II absorption is detected toward all stars, although in a few cases stellar\nlines make it impossible to measure the equivalent widths. It is likely that the low-velocity\nabsorption is a mixture of several nearby clouds in the line of sight, but we have no way of\nseparating these.\nThe Ca II/H I ratios measured for the low-velocity gas are similar for the different fields,\naveraging to 4.4\u00b11.6\u00d710\u22129 for stars projected on the Cohen Stream, 5.3\u00b11.9\u00d710\u22129 for the\ncomplex GCP stars and 5.7\u00b12.0\u00d710\u22129 for stars in the cloud g1 field. Applying the Wakker\n& Mathis (2000) relation, these values are only a factor 2\u20134 higher than expected. This is\nremarkable, since that relation was determined using HVC and IVC detections only, and\nin principle it might not be applicable to low-velocity absorption components since these\nare probably a mixture of several clouds with different column densities. Also, the column\ndensities of the low-velocity gas are a factor 10 to a 100 larger than the column densities in\nthe HVCs.\nIn the direction to complex GCP there is an absorption component at vLSR \u223c30 km s\u22121\nthat is detected in every sightline. This component is well separated in the Ca II absorption,\nbut not in the H I profile. To estimate N(H I) we therefore integrated the H I over the same\nvelocity range as the Ca II absorption. The measured Ca II/H I ratio is rather uncertain\nbecause the associated H I column density is very difficult to measure. Using a flat rotation\ncurve this gas would have a kinematical distance of 2.0 kpc (R=7.1 kpc, z=\u22120.5 kpc). This\nis consistent with the detection toward the star at 1.8\u00b10.3 kpc, but the detections toward\nthe star that are 0.7\u00b10.6 kpc and 1.1\u00b10.5 kpc distant suggest that the gas is much nearer\nthan indicated by the simple kinematical model. At a distance of 0.7 kpc, the expected\nradial velocity is only \u223c8 km s\u22121 , so this gas deviates by about 20 km s\u22121 from its expected\nvelocity.\n\n\f\u2013 27 \u2013\n6.\n\nDiscussion\n\nWe now present a short discussion summarizing the implications of our results as they\npertain to the mass inflow rate of external gas, to the study of the escape of ionizing radiation\nfrom the Milky Way and to the understanding of tidal streams around the Milky Way. We\ndo not give a full discussion of these items \u2013 that will be saved for a future paper, after we\nhave determined more HVC and IVC distances.\nOne of the more important processes that HVCs trace is the infall of low-metallicity\nmateral onto the Milky Way. Wakker et al. (1999) found that HVC complex C (which has\na metallicity 0.15 times solar \u2013 Wakker et al. 1999; Richter et al. 2001; Tripp et al. 2003;\nSembach et al. 2004) contributes a mass inflow rate of about 0.1\u20130.2 M\u2299 yr\u22121 , assuming a\ndistance of 10 kpc. A similar calculation for HVC complex A shows that it contributes about\n0.05 M\u2299 yr\u22121 . Although we do not know the metallicity of the Cohen Stream, its location\nand velocity leads us to predict that it is a low-metallicity newcomer to the Milky Way. As\nTable 4 shows, it contributes about 0.01 M\u2299 yr\u22121 .\nThere are a number of other HVCs that may represent low-metallicity infalling gas.\nHowever, we do not have direct data to prove this. These are the HVCs in complexes H,\nACHV, ACVHV, GN, P (see Wakker & van Woerden 1991 for the definition). If all of these\nobjects were at a distance of 10 kpc, they would represent an inflow rate of 0.4 M\u2299 yr\u22121 . The\nCohen Stream is one of the larger, but not one of the brighter HVCs in the ACHV complex.\nIf all clouds in this complex are 10 kpc distant, the complex as a whole corresponds to a\nmass flow rate of 0.1 M\u2299 yr\u22121 .\nPutman et al. (2004) proposed that most, if not all, of the HVCs in the Anti Center\nregion are in the orbit of the Sagittarius dwarf, and they suggested that this gas was stripped\nfrom that galaxy 200 to 300 Myr ago as it interacted with the gas at the far outskirts of the\nGalaxy. This would imply a distance on the order of 40 kpc for the Anti Center HVCs. We\ncannot directly exclude that the higher velocity HVC in the region (vLSR \u223c\u2212280 km s\u22121 ) is\nthis distant, but clearly the Cohen Stream is much closer. Moreover, the intensity of the H\u03b1\nemission from the \u2212280 km s\u22121 cloud is similar to that of the Cohen Stream, which argues\nthat their distances are similar.\nWe find that the IVC near (l,b)=(140\u25e6 ,\u221240\u25e6 ) could well be a cloud associated with the\nPerseus Arm. We do not have an accurate distance, but even so we find that its properties\nare comparable to those of the two large northern IVCs, the IV-Arch and the LLIV-Arch.\nBoth of these have near-solar metallicity, a mass on the order of 105 M\u2299 , and each represent\nan inflow of about 5\u00d710\u22123 M\u2299 yr\u22121 (Wakker 2004). Thus, if we were living in the Perseus\nArm, this IVC would show up as a fairly large solar-metallicity infalling cloud near the\n\n\f\u2013 28 \u2013\nGalactic south pole.\nThe g1 cloud has properties just like what is expected for gas taking part in the outflow\nphase of a Galactic Fountain (see Houck & Bregman 1991). As the hot gas flows out it starts\ncondensing a few kpc up, before it reaches its maximum height (cloud g1 is at z\u223c1 kpc,\nmoving out with 25 km s\u22121 ). The process of ejecting the gas destroys much of the dust,\nleading to relatively high gaseous abundances (cloud g1 has a larger than average Ca II/H I\nratio). But most of the gas is still ionized (M(H+ )\u223c5\u201310 M(H I) for cloud g1). The only\nthing we still have not measured directly is the metallicity of cloud g1, which will require\nspectra in the 1000\u20131300 \u00c5 spectra range for UV-bright stars projected onto it. We expect\nthe metallicity to be solar.\nFinally, we note that some of the conclusions above can be confirmed by measuring the\ncloud metallicities. This can be done by determining the abundance of O I, S II and other\nions in spectra of UV-bright targets located behind our clouds. A check of the FUSE and\nHST archives shows that no useful data exists at present. Targets behind the clouds have\nbeen observed, but their spectra have too low resolution, there are too many stellar lines, or\nthey are too faint to provide enough background flux.\n\n7.\n\nConclusions\n\nWe report on VLT observations of 24 stars and one QSO projected on four high-velocity\nclouds (HVC). Using these data we derive distances to these objects. We combine H I and\nH\u03b1 data to estimate the total cloud (neutral and ionized) gas masses.\n(1) We derive a distance bracket of 5.0 to 11.7 kpc for Cohen Stream, a cloud that is\nthe most-negative-latitude large cloud in the Anti-Center complex of HVCs. This places the\ncloud between 3.7 and 8.6 kpc below the Galactic plane. The stream runs from (l,b)\u223c(175\u25e6 ,\u221230\u25e6 )\nto (l,b)\u223c(140\u25e6 ,\u221252\u25e6 ), and has velocities of vLSR \u223c\u2212110 km s\u22121 . Ca II K and H absorption\nis detected toward the QSO SDSS J014631.99+133506.3 with equivalent widths of 17\u00b13\nand 11\u00b13 m\u00c5, respectively. We also find a 17\u00b13 m\u00c5 Ca II K absorption in the spectrum\nof the 11.2\u00b11.0 kpc distant RR Lyrae star SDSS J015133.91+141105.2. The lower limit\nis derived from the significant non-detection of high-velocity Ca II toward the BHB star\n2MASS J014936.48+143914.6 (21 m\u00c5 line expected, 3\u03c3 upper limit 9 m\u00c5).\n(2) The distance bracket for the Cohen Stream implies a total neutral hydrogen mass\nof 2.5 to 3.9\u00d7105 M\u2299 for the cloud, and an associated mass inflow rate on the order of\n0.004 M\u2299 yr\u22121 . H\u03b1 emission from the Cohen Stream has been detected at one position and\nits intensity suggests an amount of ionized gas that is comparable to the amount of neutral\n\n\f\u2013 29 \u2013\ngas. The complex of HVCs that the Cohen Stream is a part of would represent a total inflow\nof 0.1 M\u2299 yr\u22121 if all clouds in the complex are at similar distances. A direct measurement\nof the metallicity of this complex is still lacking, so the interpretation of the complex as\ninfalling low-metallicity gas is not confirmed.\n(3) We find a rough distance bracket of 1.0 to 2.7 kpc for intermediate-velocity gas in\nthe direction of the Cohen Stream. This suggests that this gas is part of a high-z extension\nof the Perseus Arm, similar to the more well-studied northern intermediate-velocity clouds.\nLike these clouds the IVC may be part of a Galactic Fountain flow, but it is associated with\nthe Perseus Arm rather than with the Local Arm.\n(4) We determine the distance to HVC complex GCP as 9.8 to 15.1 kpc, based on the\ndetection of Ca II K absorption (51\u00b13 m\u00c5) in the spectrum of the RR Lyrae star V1084 Aql\n(D=14.5\u00b11.3 kpc), and the significant non-detection (3\u03c3 limit 11 m\u00c5, expected 59 m\u00c5)\ntoward the RR Lyrae V1172 Aql (D=10.5\u00b11.4 kpc).\n(5) The distance bracket for complex GCP implies the cloud is at a galactocentric radius\nof 6.2 to 9.7 kpc, lies 2.5 to 3.9 kpc below the plane and has a neutral gas mass of \u223c106 M\u2299 .\nH\u03b1 emission is detected from two positions in the cloud and implies an ionized component\nthat is 40 to 120% as large as the neutral component. At its location the cloud is moving\nwith a velocity of 35\u201375 km s\u22121 relative to gas taking part in differential galactic rotation,\nand it is moving away from the Galactic plane at about 10\u201320 km s\u22121 .\n(6) For the IVC cloud g1 we derive a distance bracket of 1.8 to 3.8 kpc, detecting the associated absorption in the spectra of three stars 2MASS J213327.04+133026.7\n(D=8.2\u00b10.9 kpc), FW Peg (D=3.6\u00b10.8 kpc) and BS 17578-0016 (D=3.6\u00b10.5), but not in\nfour nearer stars. This places the IVC 0.8 to 1.7 kpc below the Galactic disk, and implies\nthat it has a peculiar velocity of about 55 km s\u22121 . It is a small cloud, with a mass of no more\nthan 104 M\u2299 , and an area of (60\u2013130)2 pc2 . It is moving away from the Galactic plane with\na velocity of about 20 km s\u22121 . The relatively bright H\u03b1 emission coming from this cloud\n(Smoker et al. 2002) implies that there is a factor 5 to 10 more ionized gas than neutral\ngas. The most likely interpretation for this object appears to be that it is condensing in an\nupward Fountain flow.\n(7) The Ca II/H I ratios that we derive are all in line with the relation between R(Ca II)\nand N(H I) that was found by Wakker & Mathis (2000), except that each cloud appears\nto have a different scaling factor. In particular, the Cohen Stream detections are a factor\n0.44\u00b10.5 below the average relation, for the Perseus Arm gas the scaling factor is 0.62\u00b10.11,\nthe complex GCP detection is on the average, while the cloud g1 detections fall a factor\n2.2\u00b11.0 above the average.\n\n\f\u2013 30 \u2013\n(8) We have set new distance brackets to four HVCs/IVCs, which trace at least two\nof the different origins of HVCs: inflow of new material (the Cohen Stream), the Galactic\nFountain (cloud g1 and the Perseus Arm IVC). The origin of the fourth cloud (complex GCP)\nis less clear, but with our distance estimate detailed modeling is now possible. In the future\nwe hope to determine more distances to HVCs/IVCs, and we should eventually be able to\nmeasure the inflow rate of accreting material as well as the rate of circulation of gas between\ndisk and halo.\nB.P.W., D.G.Y, R.W. and T.C.B. acknowledge support from grant AST-06-07154 awarded\nby the US National Science Foundation.

(2000). Colors represent LSR velocities, as coded in the\nwedge. Contour levels are at brightness temperatures of 0.05, 0.25, 0.5 and 1 K. The positions\nof the clouds discussed in this paper are shown by the thick-rimmed circles. Note that\ncloud g1 does not show up in this map because its velocity (+70 km s\u22121 ) falls outside the\nvelocity range covered by Hulsbosch & Wakker (1988). Also shown are the locations of the\nthree stars toward which high-velocity absorption was previously detected.\n\n\f\u2013 46 \u2013\n\nFig. 2.- Map of the column density of the Cohen Stream, integrating the LAB data of\nKalberla et al. (2005) between vLSR =\u2212130 km s\u22121 and vLSR =\u221280 km s\u22121 . Contours are at\ncolumn densities of 1, 2 and 4\u00d71019 cm\u22122 . The locations of the background stars are overlaid.\nThe size (i.e. area) of the symbols is proportional to the distance of the star. Closed circles are\nfor directions where the HVC is detected in absorption. Closed triangles are for significant\nnon-detections. Open circles are for non-detections that do not allow a conclusion concerning\nthe HVC's distance. Crosses are for stars where the interstellar absorption is too blended\nwith stellar lines. The QSO is shown by an five-pointed star instead of a closed circle.\n\n\f\u2013 47 \u2013\n\nFig. 3.- Map of the column density of the IVC in the Cohen Stream field, gas probably associated with the high-z extension of the Perseus Arm, integrating the LAB data of Kalberla\net al.

One star per row, with the name and\ndistance given in the top left corner of the K and H panels. Distances are preceded by \">\"\nfor lower limits, by \"<\" for upper limits. Distances in brackets show that the detection limit\nis worse than the expected equivalent width, or there are too many stellar lines. Labels\n(Ca II(*) and H\u01eb(*)) show the positions of stellar absorption lines. Vertical lines give the\nvelocities of the H I components. Triangles and numbers in each Ca II panel give the shape\nof the expected absorption line, the expected equivalent width, and the 3\u03c3 detection limit\nor the detected equivalent width (a \"0\" means there is a blended stellar line).\n\n\f\u2013 52 \u2013\n\nFig. 8.- Same as Fig. 7, except for complex GCP.\n\n\f\u2013 53 \u2013\n\nFig. 9.- Same as Fig. 7, except for cloud g1.\n\n\f"}
