The\ntimescale problem is less extreme for metals in the rarer helium-dominated (DB) white\ndwarfs, since the depletion of metals due to diffusion at the bottom of the He-convection\nzone is slower than at the bottom of the H-convection zone and since the higher transparency\nof helium atmospheres makes lower metal abundances more visible.\nHeavy elements have been known in WD atmospheres for almost 50 years (in the DB\nvMa 2; Weidemann 1958), though the first convincing demonstration of metals in a DA\nwas not until Lacombe et al. (1983). It took another 14 years to find the second and third\nDAZs (Koester et al. 1997; Holberg et al. 1997). The DAZ sample then began to grow with\nthe breakthrough survey of Zuckerman & Reid (1998), which yielded seven to nine new\nDAZs. Subsequent modern surveys (e.g., Zuckerman et al. 2003) have shown that \u223c25%\nof all single DAs possess metals in their photospheres. On the theoretical side, early work\nfocused on understanding how WDs might accrete sufficient material from the interstellar\nmedium (ISM) to maintain metals in their atmospheres. Some researchers (Dupuis et al.\n1993; Koester & Wilken 2006) concluded that ISM accretion is the source of the photospheric metals, while other researchers (Aannestad et al. 1993; Zuckerman & Reid 1998;\nZuckerman et al. 2003; Kilic & Redfield 2007) concluded that ISM accretion is insufficient.\nAn alternative hypothesis, that DAZs accrete their metals from circumstellar material, has\ngone from an intriguing possibility based on just one DAZ with a debris disk (G29-38,\nZuckerman & Becklin 1987), to a compelling scenario, especially now that five debris disk\nwhite dwarfs are known, all of which happen to be DAZs (Becklin et al. 2005; Kilic et al.\n2005, 2006; von Hippel et al. 2007; Kilic & Redfield 2007). These DAZs with debris disks\nare now known as DAZd white dwarfs (von Hippel et al. 2007). The newly discovered debris\ndisk WDs, the high relative frequency of DAZs and their plausible connection to circumstellar debris (e.g., Jura 2003), as well as new catalogs of DAZs (Zuckerman et al. 2003;\nKoester et al. 2005), have created new opportunities to understand the origin of DAZs and\ntheir accretion processes.\nIn this paper we study archival time-series spectroscopy from multiple epochs of the\nluminosity variable DAZ white dwarf G29-38 (=WD2326+049). The case for Ca line strength\nvariations in G29-38 is complicated since this star is a pulsating WD. The parameters for\nG29-38 are Teff = 12100, log(g) = 7.9, log(Ca/H) = \u22126.8 (Koester et al. 2005), distance =\n19 pc (Harrington & Dahn 1980), or log(g) = 8.14 (Bergeron et al. 1995). The timescale for\ngravitational settling in this star is 7 days according to Koester & Wilken (2006), shorter\nfor the higher log(g) of Bergeron et al. (1995), and therefore Ca line strength variations are\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nplausible. After accounting for the effects of pulsation, we find clear evidence that the Ca II\nK line strength varies in this star. Metal line strength variability is a new tool for the study\nof accretion onto WDs and it may eventually help us unravel the source(s) of metals found\nin DAZ atmospheres.\n\n2.\n\nObservations\n\nBoth van Kerkwijk et al. (2000) and Thompson et al. (2007) published time-series spectroscopy of G29-38 in order to measure the spherical degree of pulsation modes via line shape\nvariations of the Balmer series. We use these spectra to measure the Ca II K line strength\npresent in this star. On November 19, 1996, van Kerkwijk et al. (2000) obtained 4.72 hours\nof continuous (no readout gaps) 12s exposures of G29-38 with the Low Resolution Imaging\nSpectrometer on the Keck II Telescope. The resolution was set by the seeing to be \u223c 7 \u00c5,\nand the average spectrum has a signal-to-noise of 1000 measured at the continuum near 5000\n\u00c5. For the same purposes, on August 27, 1999, Thompson et al. (2007) obtained 6.14 hours\nof continuous spectroscopy with the FORS1 spectrograph on the VLT (see also Thompson\n2006). Each of the 604 spectra has an exposure time of 16 s and a resolution of \u223c 8 \u00c5.\nThe average spectrum has a signal-to-noise of 500 measured at the continuum near 5000 \u00c5.\nThompson (2006) and Thompson et al. (2007) performed standard reductions on both sets\nof data, except that flat fields and traditional flux calibrations were not possible for either\ndataset. In both cases the average spectra are visibly smooth near 4000 \u00c5, and we have\ndetermined that the lack of flat-fields has a negligible effect on our EW measurements. In\nboth datasets, the Ca II 3933 \u00c5 line is clearly visible, a fact that we utilize to demonstrate\nEW variations between these two observations.\n\n3.\n\nCalcium Equivalent Width Measurements\n\nIn Figure 1 we present the average Ca II K line region of G29-38 at two epochs, 1996.885\nand 1999.653. The average spectrum taken with the Keck telescope in 1996 shows an obvious\nCa II K line with EW = 165 \u00b1 4 m\u00c5. The average spectrum taken with the VLT in 1999\nshows a deeper Ca line with EW = 280 \u00b1 8 m\u00c5, an increase of 70%. Formally, these two\nobservations differ by 12.9 \u03c3. Each are measured by fitting a Gaussian to the spectral line\nand the errors are those associated with that fit.\nWe need to ensure that the pulsations of G29-38, which produce brightness variations\nas high as 3% for a single pulsation, are not responsible for the changes in Ca line strength.\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nThe pulsating modes cause changes in surface temperature and radial velocity fields, both of\nwhich can alter the measured absorption lines. Since the 1996 and 1999 data sets are time\nseries of spectra, we measure how the EW changes over the pulsation cycle and how this\nchange is reduced by integrating over the extended periods of the Keck and VLT observations.\nUsing these measurements, we demonstrate (see below) that the pulsations have a negligible\neffect compared to the observed 70% change in EW of the average spectra.\nWe measured the equivalent width for each spectrum of both the Keck and VLT data\nsets by fitting a Gaussian to the calcium line after normalizing the spectra. We fit an 8thorder polynomial across 20 \u00c5 on each side of the Ca II K line of the average spectrum. We\nremoved the curvature induced by the broad hydrogen lines on either side of the Ca line by\ndividing each spectrum by this fit to the average. These flattened spectra were normalized\nas we fit the Gaussian function by allowing the overall flux of the spectrum to vary during\nthe fit. During the fit, the area and FWHM of the Gaussian were allowed to vary.\nWe performed a Fourier Transform (FT) on the time-series Ca EW measurements (Figure 2). These FTs provide a clear indication of how much the line strength can change during\na single observing run due to pulsation effects. The EW FTs clearly show that the pulsations\nare stronger during the Keck epoch. The flux amplitude of the largest observed pulsation\n(measured at 615s) in the VLT data is 2.7% (Thompson et al. 2007) while the largest mode\n(measured at 614s) in the Keck data is 3.17% (van Kerkwijk et al. 2000). Therefore, one\nwould expect the Keck observations to exhibit larger variations in Ca equivalent width. The\nequivalent width amplitude of these largest flux modes are 7.1% and 13.8%, with the Keck\namplitude being 1.9 times larger than the VLT amplitude. See Table 1 for the amplitude of\nthe EW variations measured at the dominant modes in each data set. Finally, we calculate\nthe average value of the measured equivalent widths, weighted by the errors established from\nfitting the Gaussian. The values 167 \u00b1 1.7 m\u00c5 for the Keck epoch and 272 \u00b1 1.9 m\u00c5 for\nthe VLT epoch (an increase in 63%) are in close agreement with the equivalent width of the\nunweighted average spectrum.\nThe pulsations cause deviations from the average equivalent width. Observing an incomplete cycle of a dominant pulsation can result in an abnormally high or low measurement\nof the average EW. To determine how large this effect could be, we calculated a worst case\nfor this star. This worst case provides an outer bounds for our data set (useful for our error\nanalyses, below) and should help future observers who wish to repeat this experiment with\nG29-38, possibly with long exposures that do not resolve the pulsation modes. We combined\nsix modes with semi-amplitude (mean to maximum) EW variations of 8, 12, and 15% (2\neach) and we chose periods from 1150 to 600 seconds based on previous observations (see\nFigure 3 for the specific modes). Since the modes of G29-38 vary in strength with time, this\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nallows for maximal pulsations (which are larger amplitude modes than we actually observed\nin the Keck and VLT data). This approach also encompasses the possibility of observing\na few large amplitude modes along with a few moderate amplitude modes. Figure 3 shows\nthe possible range of EW values in percentage terms ((max EW - min EW) / mean EW)\ndue to only partial averaging over pulsation modes, as a function of cumulative exposure\ntimes. For an extremely short exposure time, we could observe an EW difference as large as\n\u223c100% given the semi-amplitudes of the modes introduced in this example. After one hour\nof cumulative exposure, the maximum expected EW difference due to the pulsation modes\nof this star drop to 5%. After 3.5 hours this effect is < 1.5%.\nSince the VLT and Keck spectra are time series, we know the size of the Ca EW\nvariations and can better estimate the error associated with partial averaging. Including\nonly the three largest pulsations of the Keck data and averaging over a total of 4.7 hours\nspaced in 24s intervals (identical to the Keck observations), we find a deviation of less than\n0.3% in the EW. This translates to at most an additional error of 0.5 m\u00c5 and 0.8 m\u00c5 for\nthe Keck and VLT measurements, respectively. This is equivalent to one third of the error\nin the weighted average and one tenth of the error from fitting the average spectrum. We\nconclude that partial averaging over the pulsations cannot account for the observed 70%\nvariation between the measured Ca EW in 1996 at Keck and 1999 at the VLT.\nIn summary, we find that the EW of Ca increased by 63-70% between 1996.885 and\n1999.653. The difference between these two estimates is likely dominated by subtle differences\nin how we measure EWs, and this range is a useful estimate of the accuracy in the measured\nchange in Ca EWs. Only a negligible amount of this 63-70% change is due to residual,\nunaccounted-for pulsation effects.\nBesides these two epochs with time-series spectroscopy, we were able to derive Ca EWs\nfor nine additional spectra of G29-38, kindly provided to us by D. Koester. Two spectra of\n30 minute duration each were observed with the Calar Alto 2.2m Cassegrain spectrograph on\nSeptember 18 and 20, 1995. These spectra were the source of the discovery by Koester et al.\n(1997) that G29-38 is a DAZ. Due to the temporal proximity of the Calar Alto observations,\nwe averaged together the spectra before measuring the Ca EW. This averaging also decreased\nthe spectral noise and reduced the pulsation error. Five spectra of 30 minute duration each\nwere observed with Keck, one on the night of July 7, 1997, one on the night of December\n10, 1998, and three on the night of August 12, 1999. To increase the signal-to-noise for\nAugust 12, 1999, we averaged together the spectra from this night before measuring the\nCa EW. Two additional spectra of 5 minute duration were obtained at VLT/UVES on the\nnights of August 6, 2000 and September 17, 2000. Further details on the observations and\ndata quality for these spectra can be found in Koester et al. (2001), Koester et al. (2005),\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nand Zuckerman et al. (2003). From these nine additional spectra we derive Ca EWs at six\nadditional epochs. All of these measured Ca EWs, as well as the two derived from the timeseries spectroscopy discussed above, are presented in Figure 4. The error bars represent\nthe 1 \u03c3 quadrature combination of the Ca EW measurement uncertainty and the expected\nEW variation caused by sampling over partial luminosity periods. Figure 3 represents the\nmaximum observed error from partial averaging and thus we use these values as a 3\u03c3 estimate\nfor this error for all epochs except the two discussed above, where we directly measure the\namplitude of the pulsation modes.\n\n4.\n\nThe Source of Calcium Line Strength Variations\n\nSince G29-38 has a debris disk known to be rich in refractory elements (Reach et al.\n2005), it is natural to assume that the Ca variations we see are due to time-variable accretion\nfrom the disk. There is, however, another possibility worth considering-that this object\nhas a large star spot that covers more or less of the observed face of G29-38 at the different\nobservational epochs. Such star spots models have been proposed before to explain variations\nin He line strength in three WDs with mixed H/He atmospheres, G104-27 (Kidder et al.\n1992), PG1210+533 (Bergeron et al. 1994), and HS0209+0832 (Heber et al. 1997). For a\nmodel of G29-38 with steady-state accretion and a magnetically constrained star spot, the\nspot could either be enriched in Ca with respect to the rest of the star if accretion occurs\nwithin the spot, or it could be depleted in Ca if accretion occurs elsewhere. Since the variation\nin Ca EW is nearly a factor of two (Fig. 4), even in a model with dramatically different Ca\nabundances within and outside the spot, the spot would have to cover nearly half of a WD\nhemisphere. It seems unlikely that such a spot could persist for years, particularly for this\npulsating WD with pulsations sloshing across the surface every few minutes. A prediction of\nthe star spot model is that the Ca EW should be modulated on the timescale of the rotation\nperiod. This effect would be particularly apparent with observations covering two or more\nrotation periods. G29-38 appears to be rotating with v sin(i) = 11\u201328 km s\u22121 (Berger et al.\n2005), or a period of \u2264 900\u20132400 s or 2000\u20135000 s, assuming a radius consistent with log(g)\n= 8.14 or 7.9, respectively. Our VLT and Keck time-series observations cover 4.72 and\n6.14 hours, so if the star spot model were correct, the rotation period would have to be\nmeaningfully longer than 6 hours, which is inconsistent with the measured rotation velocity.\nIn summary, we consider the star spot scenario highly unlikely, yet future observations with\nbetter temporal sampling will be needed to convincingly rule it out.\nThe history of Ca EWs in G29-38 presented in Figure 4 shows that the Ca line strength\nvaries by at least a factor of two, that significant variations occur on timescales as short\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nas 15 days (August 12, 1999 to August 27, 1999), and possibly that there is a typical Ca\nEW \u2248 230 m\u00c5 with periods of both higher and lower Ca line strength. Assuming that the\nCa EW variations are caused by time-variable accretion from G29-38's debris disk, the low\nCa EW in late 1996 indicates that accretion decreased dramatically for at least one settling\ntime (expected to be \u223c 7 days; Koester & Wilken 2006). The variations in August 1999\nsimilarly indicate an increased accretion rate with a timescale of \u223c 2 settling times. Further\nobservations and analysis are required for this star in order to determine the minimum\ntimescale and range for accretion events, as well as to observationally test the theoretical\ngravitational settling time.\nWe note also that D. Koester kindly searched through multiple spectra of 24 DAZs\nfrom the SPY survey (Napiwotzki et al. 2001; Koester et al. 2005) for us in order to search\nfor other WDs with varying Ca EWs. He found no other convincing cases. Perhaps a\nlarger sample of stars or more spectra per star are needed. In any case, further examples\nbesides G29-38 would help clarify whether episodic accretion is a function of other system\nparameters and would help test the theoretically determined residence timescale for metals\nin DAZ atmospheres.\n\n5.\n\nConclusions\n\nWe find that the Ca II K line in G29-38 varies from EW = 165 \u00b1 4 m\u00c5 in 1996.885\nto EW = 280 \u00b1 8 m\u00c5 in 1999.653, or a factor of \u223c 1.7\u00d7 between these two epochs. Fully\ntaking into account variations in G29-38's EW due to sampling effects over its multi-period\npulsations, we find that the EW variations are essentially unaffected over these 4.72 hour\nand 6.14 hour time-series observations. We also measure Ca EWs in this star for a further\nsix epochs and find convincing evidence that the Ca line changes on timescales as short\nas 15 days. These Ca line-strength variations indicate that the source of the variations,\npresumably metal accretion from the debris disk, is not a steady-state process and varies\non timescales of a few weeks. Observations with greater temporal sampling are required to\ndetermine the timescale range of G29-38's episodic accretion.\nOur Ca EW measurements may already provide insight into the physics governing accretion onto this star. For instance, if accretion is dominated by Poynting-Robertson (P-R)\ndrag from the known debris disk, then the dust accretion timescale is 4r 2 a years (Reach et al.\n2005), where r is the particle distance in solar radii and a is the particle radius in microns.\nSpitzer mid-IR spectroscopy (Reach et al. 2005) indicates sub-micron silicate particles. With\nan inner debris disk edge at \u2264 0.15 R\u2299 (von Hippel et al. 2007), the P-R timescale at the\ninner disk edge is \u2264 33 days, consistent with the Ca EW variations, especially if whatever\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nprocess feeds dust to the inner disk edge is discontinuous. This scenario argues against an\noptically thin (in the radial direction) debris disk extending continuously to 1 R\u2299 or beyond.\nComparing these timescales indicates that G29-38's debris disk is likely to be optically thick\nwith collisional processes or dust delivery radially through an optically thick disk setting the\naccretion timescale.\nDue to the short settling times of metals in their atmospheres, warm (Teff = 12,000\u2013\n25,000 K) DAZs are an excellent place to look for Ca (or other metal) line strength variations.\nWill other DAZs that harbor debris disks show Ca line strength variations? And if so, will\nthe timescale or range of these variations be correlated with any of the debris disk properties?\nWill DAZs without detectable debris disks show Ca line strength variations? Answers to\nthese questions will help us understand the accretion process operating in these systems and\npossibly give us clues to the origins of white dwarf surface metals. Additionally, the timescale\nof metal line strength variations as a function of stellar effective temperature would provide\nthe first observational test of the theoretically determined residence timescale for metals in\nDAZ atmospheres.\nWe thank Detlev Koester for his many excellent spectra of G29-38, and for considerable\nconsultation on WD models and this paper.
