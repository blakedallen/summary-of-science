In this situation,\none resorts to parametrized models of correlated electrons, where the single\u2013particle and the interactioninduced aspects of the electronic states are treated on equal footing. The single\u2013particle wave\u2013functions\nare contained in the formal expressions for model parameters and should be calculated separately. We have\nproposed [1] to combine the two efforts in an exact manner.\nA separate question concerns the role of boundary conditions (BCs) in atomic rings, particularly under\nthe presence of spin frustration for odd number of atoms. This problem was investigated numerically [2]\nand the optimal BCs for a correlated system were found to remain usually the same as for the ideal Fermi\ngas on the lattice. However, the general proof of this basic fact have been elaborated very recently [3].\nIn our method of approach (EDABI), we determine first rigorously the energy of interacting particles\nin terms of the microscopic parameters for a given BCs and then allow the single\u2013particle wave functions\n(contained in the parameters) to relax in the correlated state. The method has been overviewed in [4], so we\nconcentrate here on its application to nanochains of N 6 13 atoms, containing either even or odd number\nof electrons. The discussion of parity effects complements our recent study of correlated nanochains [5],\nwhere we consider the properties of even\u2013N systems only.\nWe consider the system of N lattice sites, each containing a single valence orbital and (i.e. hydrogenic\u2013\nlike atoms). Including all long\u2013range Coulomb interaction and neglecting other terms, one can write down\nthe system Hamiltonian in the form\n\u0011\nX\nX\nX\u0010\nX\n\u2212i\u03c6/N \u2020\nKij \u03b4ni \u03b4nj ,\n(1)\nni\u2191 ni\u2193 +\ne\nc\nc\n+\nh.c.\n+U\nn\n+\nt\nH = \u01ebeff\nj+1\u03c3\nj\na\nj\u03c3\nj\n\nj\u03c3\n\ni\n\ni<j\n\nP\n\u22121\nwhere \u03b4ni \u2261 ni \u2212 1, \u01ebeff\na = \u01eba + N\ni<j (2/Rij + Kij ) (in Ry) is the effective atomic level, Rij\nis the distance between the i\u2013th and j\u2013th atoms, t is the nearest\u2013neighbor hopping, \u03c6 is the fictitious\n(dimensionless) flux through the ring, U and Kij are the intra\u2013 and inter\u2013site Coulomb repulsions. The\nlast term represents the correlated part of the long\u2013range interaction.

As the\nmicroscopic parameters \u01ebeff\na , t, U , and Kij are calculated in the Gaussian basis composing the Wannier\nfunctions, the orbital size of the 1s\u2013like state is subsequently adjusted to obtain the minimal ground state\nenergy EG as a function of the interatomic distance R.\nWe now discuss the spin\u2013spin correlations hSi * Sj i in the system ground state as a function of the\ndiscrete neighbor distance |i\u2212j| and R, as presented in Fig. 1. The effect of spin frustration in the half\u2013\nfilled case (Ne = N ) is remarkable for large R, where the quasi\u2013long range order for N = 10 (cf. Fig.\n1a), indicating the power\u2013law decay of hSi * Sj i for the Heisenberg spin chain, disappears for N = 11 (cf.\nFig. 1b), where we observe a fast, exponential decay. For small values of R, however, the effect is weaker,\nsince the antiferomagnetic order is reduced by charge fluctuations [5]. We also observe, that the values of\nthe spin gap (not shown) are significantly higher for odd N in the large\u2013R range, what can be explained by\nthe fact, that the ground\u2013state energy of the Heisenberg antiferromagnet is of the order EG \u223c JS(S + 1),\nwhere J = 4t2 /(U \u2212 K) is the kinetic\u2013exchange coupling parameter and S is the total spin value. One\nS= 3\n\nS= 1\n\nS=1\nS=0\ncan expect now, that the following inequality is satisfied EG 2 \u2212 EG 2 > EG\n\u2212 EG\n, where the left\u2013\nand the right\u2013hand sides represent the spin gap for the odd\u2013 and the even\u2013N systems, respectively (both at\nthe minimal\u2013spin configuration). The detailed behavior of the system spin, as well as the charge and the\noptical gaps will be discussed elsewhere. In the remaining part of this paper we focus on the parity effect\nfor the Fermi\u2013Dirac distribution function and the transport properties.\nThe electron momentum distribution for nanochains with optimal BCs is shown in Fig. 2a. The discrete\nmomenta, corresponding to the solutions of the single\u2013particle part of the Hamiltonian (1) for a finite N ,\nare given by\n\nkq (\u03c6) =\n\n2\u03c0q \u2212 \u03c6\n,\nN\n\n0 6 q < N.\n\n(2)\n\nThe optimal BCs, corresponding to the minimal ground\u2013state energy EG , are realized for \u03c6 = 0 when\nN = 4n + 2 (periodic BC), \u03c6 = \u03c0 when N = 4n (antiperiodic BC) and \u03c6 = \u03c0/2, 3\u03c0/2 when N is odd\n[3]. A basic analysis of Eq. (2) shows, that for the optimal BCs, the Fermi momentum state kF = \u03c0/2R\nis newer reached for even N , whereas for odd N it happens, for a single value of q. This circumstance\nhas tremendous implications for electronic structure of a nanochain, however, of almost does not effect its\ntransport properties, as we show in the end part of this paper.\nc 2003 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The optimal boundary conditions are\nspecified for each curve.\n\nThe remarkable feature of these results, is that the datapoints for different but even N (cf. full symbols\nin Fig. 2a) locate smoothly on the universal curve (for each R), when optimal BCs are applied. This is not\nthe case for odd N (cf. open symbols in Fig. 2a), when the systematic dependence on N suggests quite slow\nconvergence to the even\u2013N results with the increasing N . However, the discussion of N \u2192 \u221e limit is\nbeyond the scope of this paper, since we concentrate here on nanochains. To analyze such systems in detail,\nwe have displayed in Fig. 2b the continuous electron momentum distribution obtained for the dense set of\nkq (\u03c6) defined by Eq. (2), when \u03c6 \u2208 h0, 2\u03c0). The datapoints corresponding to optimal BC for N = 10 and\n11 are also presented to show, they are situated close to the different local extrema of n(kq (\u03c6)) (e.g. maxima\nfor even N and minima for odd, or vice versa). Except of different frequency of internal oscillations (equal\nto 2N R), the n(kq (\u03c6)) functions for N = 10 and 11 looks almost identically. This is the reason, why\nvarious physical properties of small clusters are often averaged over BC, particularly in 2D [6]. We also\nperform such averaging to obtain almost size\u2013independent n(k) functions, drawn again in Fig. 2a (the\ndetails of the averaging procedure will be published elsewhere). However, the elimination of the internal\noscillations for a given N may only be considered as an approximation of N \u2192 \u221e scaling procedure, and\nin the case of momentum distribution n(k) seems less accurate then fitting the Luttinger\u2013liquid formulas to\neven N data, which we proposed before [5]. Nevertheless, the common nature of either original n(kq (\u03c6))\nor averaged n(k) functions for both even and odd N , illustrated in Fig. 2, helps to understand why the\nchain parity does not effect its Drude weight even for optimal boundary conditions, when the structure of\nthe momentum space is significantly different.\nc 2003 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Spa\u0142ek: ELECTRONIC STRUCTURE AND PARITY EFFECTS ...\n\nThe normalized Drude weight, shown in Fig. 3, is defined in the standard manner [8]\nD=\u2212\n\n1 \u2202 2 EG\nhT i \u2202\u03c62\n\n,\n\n(3)\n\n\u03c6=\u03c6min\n\nwhere hT i is the average kinetic energy and \u03c6min denotes optimal BCs. In the half\u2013filled case Ne = N (cf.\nFig. 3a) Drude weight gradually decrease with N , as we have shown for even N [5]. The most interesting\nfeature of these results is, that the curves for odd N fits smoothly between those for even N , with very weak\nparity effect (totally incomparable with that present in the charge gap and electron momentum distribution,\nwhen optimal BC are applied). This observation can be understood when we take into account, that the\nDrude weight defined by Eq. 3 is the integral quantity, involving the summation over all the excited states\nof the Hamiltonian Eq. (1), so it cannot be determined only by the electronic structure near the Fermi\npoints, particularly for a small system.\nThe parity effect on Drude weight disappears for the system with a single hole (Ne = N \u2212 1, cf. Fig.\n3b), in which the magnetic frustration is absent. For this case, the Drude weight evolution with R is very\ninteresting. In the weak\u2013correlation range (R/a0 . 2) the chain shows a highly\u2013conducting behavior\nfor each N . Next, in the intermediate range (R/a0 = 4 \u00f7 5) the Drude weight decrease rapidly with\nN , indicating an insulating (Mott\u2013Hubbard) state in the large\u2013N limit. In the strongly\u2013correlated range\n(R/a0 \u223c 10) the Drude weight approaches again its maximal value D = 1. Such a behavior can be\nexplained, when we analyze the situation in two steps: First, for low values of R, the bandwidth\u2013to\u2013\ninteraction ratio is small, and the system with a single hole does not differ significantly from a half\u2013filled\none. This is why in both cases Drude weight decreases gradually with both N and R, as the tunneling\namplitude through the barrier of a finite width. Second, for the largest values of R, the system can be\ndescribed by an effective t \u2212 J model [9] with a coupling constant J = 4t2 /(U \u2212 K) \u226a |t| (where\nK \u2261 Kj,j+1 denotes the nearest neighbor Coulomb repulsion), which corresponds to an asymptotically\u2013\nfree hole motion. Then, it become clear that in the intermediate range the Drude weight has to suppressed,\nwhat can be interpreted in terms of a partially localized spin\u2013ordered state. It would be very interesting to\ntest experimentally this result, possibly for a mesoscopic atomic ring.\nIn summary, we have shown that a nanochain parity effect strongly its electronic structure and momentum distribution, and that the effects are opposite for these two principal characteristics. Namely, the\npresence of a discrete momenta in the Fermi point reduce significantly the finite\u2013size effects on the system\ncharge\u2013gap, but amplifies them in the case of momentum distribution. On the other hand, the parity effect\nis weak, or even absent in the case if system transport properties. Additionally, an interesting crossover\nbehavior has been identified for the chain with a single hole, for which the quantum\u2013liquid regions are\nseparated by a partly localized state.\nThe support from the Polish Science Foundation (FNP) is acknowledged.\n\nReferences\n[1] J.
