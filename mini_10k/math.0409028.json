This paper is an initial inquiry into the structure of the Hopf\nalgebra of matroids with restriction-contraction coproduct. Using a family of\nmatroids introduced by Crapo in 1965, we show that the subalgebra generated\nby a single point and a single loop in the dual of this Hopf algebra is free.\n\n1. introduction\nMajor advances in combinatorial theory during recent decades rely upon algebraic structures associated to combinatorial objects, and indeed, often involve\nstudies of combinatorial properties of algebraic systems themselves. In particular,\nHopf algebras based on families of combinatorial structures such as posets, graphs,\npermutations and tableaux play an increasingly prominent role in contemporary\ncombinatorial theory and have been applied to a wide variety of fields. A major\nexception to this trend occurs in matroid theory, where little attention has been\npaid to naturally occurring algebraic structures. One such structure, introduced by\none of the present authors in [20], is a Hopf algebra that may be associated to any\nfamily of matroids that is closed under formation of minors and direct sums. This\nHopf algebra has as basis the set of isomorphism classes of matroids belonging to\nthe given family, with product induced\nP by the direct sum operation, and coproduct\nof a matroid M = M (S) given by A\u2286S M |A\u2297M/A, where M |A is the submatroid\nobtained by restriction to A and M/A is the complementary contraction. A closely\nrelated Hopf algebra was constructed by Joni and Rota in [12], as the incidence\ncoalgebra of a hereditary family of geometric lattices. In this case, attention is\nrestricted to simple matroids, and the subsets A appearing in the coproduct are\ntaken to be flats. These Hopf algebras were also briefly considered in connection\nwith the characteristic and Tutte polynomials of matroids in [14] and [16].\nSimilar constructions have arisen with increasing frequency in recent years, as\nHopf algebra techniques have been brought to bear on the study of Feynman diagrams and renormalization processes in Physics ([9], [15], [5]), Vassiliev's knot\ninvariants ([6], [7], [8], [13]) and graph invariants ([11], [19]). All of this work has\nbeen carried out in the context of graphs, which form an extremely restricted class\nof matroids, and which have a grossly different classification by isomorphism, save\nwhen attention is restricted to 3-connected graphs.\nThe present article is an initial inquiry into the structure of the matroid Hopf\nalgebra given in [20]. We prove that the subalgebra of the dual algebra generated by \"point\" and \"loop\" (the two one-element matroids) is free. (The question\nof whether of not the corresponding subalgebra, in the context of graphs, is free,\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 05B35, 06A11, 16W30, 05A15, 17A50.\nKey words and phrases. Matroid, minor algebra, free algebra.\nSchmitt partially supported by NSA grant 02G-134.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nHENRY CRAPO AND WILLIAM SCHMITT\n\nwhich was posed by Lowell Abrams, remains open.) We manage this proof by\nrestricting attention to a class of 2n mutually nonisomorphic matroids on an n\nelement set which we call \"freedom matroids\". These matroids are obtained, starting from the empty matroid, by successively adding points, at each stage either in\na new dimension or in general position in the top rank. Freedom matroids were\nintroduced by the other present author, in [10], in order to prove that there are\nat least 2n nonisomorphic matroids on n elements. The same matroids, presented\nas transversal matroids, were used in [21] to give a simplified proof of the same\nresult. Several characterizations of freedom matroids were given in [17], where it\nwas also shown that the family of all freedom matroids is closed under formation of\nminors and duals. In the present paper, we adduce a number of new combinatorial\nproperties of freedom matroids. This work is thus a useful adjunct to recent work\nthat has modeled these, and generalizations of these, matroids in terms of Dyck\npaths ([1]) and lattice paths ([3]), and other work, soon to appear ([2], [4]).\n2. Coalgebras of matroids\nThroughout this paper, we work over some commutative ring K with unit. All\nmodules, algebras and coalgebras are over K, all maps between such objects are\nassumed to be K-linear, and all tensor products are taken over K. Given any\nf for the set of isomorphism classes of matroids\nfamily of matroids M, we write M\nf the free K-module having M\nf as basis. For\nbelonging to M, and denote by K{M}\nany matroid M = M (S), and A \u2286 S, we write M |A for the restriction of M to A,\nand M/A for the matroid on S\\A obtained by contracting A from M .\nThe following result appeared in [20], as an example of the more general construction of incidence Hopf algebras:\nf is a\nProposition 2.1. If M is a minor-closed family of matroids then K{M}\ncoalgebra, with coproduct \u03b4 and counit \u01eb determined by\n(\nX\n1, if S = \u2205,\n\u03b4(M ) =\nM |A \u2297 M/A\nand\n\u01eb(M ) =\n0,\notherwise,\nA\u2286S\nfor all M = M (S) \u2208 M. If, furthermore, the family M is closed under formation\nf is a Hopf algebra, with product induced by direct sum.\nof direct sums, then K{M}\n\nf\nWhenever M is minor-closed, we shall write C(M) for the module K{M}\nequipped with the above coalgebra structure.\nWe remark that in the statement of Proposition 2.1, and in all that follows, we\ndo not distinguish notationally between matroids and their isomorphism classes;\nit will always be clear from the context which is meant. For the purposes of this\narticle, we are interested primarily in the case in which M is minor-closed and\nnot necessarily closed under direct sums and hence C(M) is only a coalgebra.\nWe don't give a complete proof of the proposition here, but only mention that\ncoassociativity of \u03b4 follows directly from the basic identities (M |T )|U = M |U ,\n(M/U )/(T \\U ) = M/T and (M/U )|(T \\U ) = (M |T )/U , which hold for any matroid\nM = M (S) and U \u2286 T \u2286 S.\nIn the case that M is closed under formation of direct sums, a formula for the\nantipode of M may be deduced from the formula for the antipode of an arbitrary\nincidence Hopf algebra given in [20].\n\n\fA FREE SUBALGEBRA OF THE ALGEBRA OF MATROIDS\n\n3\n\nWe will use the following notation for some specific matroids:\nIn = Un,n\nZn = U0,n\nPn = U1,n\nCn = Un\u22121,n\nI = I1\nZ = Z1\n\nthe free matroid of size n\nthe zero matroid of size n\nthe n-point\nthe n-circuit\npoint\nloop,\n\nwhere, as usual, Ur,n denotes the uniform matroid of rank r on n points.\nExample 2.2. Let L be the matroid shown in Figure 1, consisting of points\na, b, c, d, e in the plane, with {a, b, c} and {a, d, e} collinear. If M is any minorclosed family containing L, then the coproduct of L in C(M) is given by\n\u03b4(L) = L \u2297 \u2205 + 4(C3 \u2295 I) \u2297 Z + C4 \u2297 Z + 2C3 \u2297 P2 + 8I3 \u2297 Z2\n+ 6I2 \u2297 (P2 \u2295 Z) + 4I2 \u2297 P3 + 4I \u2297 N + I \u2297 (P2 \u2295 P2 ) + \u2205 \u2297 L,\nwhere \u2295 denotes the direct sum operation on matroids, and N is the three-point\nline with one of its points doubled.\nc\u2022\nb\u2022\n\na\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\nd\n\n\u2022\ne\n\nFigure 1.\nExample 2.3. The family I = {In : n \u2265 0} of all free matroids is minor-closed,\nand the coalgebra P\nC(I) is the\n\u0001 free module K{I0 , I1 , . . . }, with coproduct and counit\ngiven by \u03b4(In ) = nk=0 nk Ik \u2297 In\u2212k and \u01eb(In ) = \u03b4n,0 , for all n \u2265 0. Because I is\nalso closed under formation of direct sums, C(I) is in fact a Hopf algebra. Since\nIn is equal to the direct sum of n copies of I, we have In = I n in C(I), and\nthus C(I) is the polynomial Hopf algebra K[I], with coproduct determined by\n\u03b4(I) = I \u2297 1 + 1 \u2297 I.\nSimilarly, the family Z = {Zn : n \u2265 0} of all zero matroids is closed under\nformation of minors and direct sums, and C(Z) is equal to the polynomial Hopf\nalgebra K[Z], with \u03b4(Z) = Z \u2297 1 + 1 \u2297 Z.\nNote that the coproducts in Example 2.3 are cocommutative. This is because\nthe operations of deletion and contraction on free and zero matroids happen to\ncoincide. In fact, these are the only matroids on which these operations coincide;\nif M is any minor-closed family that contains matroids outside of I \u222a Z, then the\ncoalgebra C(M) is noncocommutative.\nExample 2.4. The class U of all uniform matroids is minor-closed, and the coproduct on C(U) is given by\n\u0012 \u0013\nn\nr \u0012 \u0013\nX\nX\nn\nn\nUr,i \u2297 U0,n\u2212i ,\nUi,i \u2297 Ur\u2212i,n\u2212i +\n\u03b4(Ur,n ) =\ni\ni\ni=r+1\ni=0\n\n\f4\n\nHENRY CRAPO AND WILLIAM SCHMITT\n\nfor all n \u2265 r \u2265 0. If we adopt the convention that Uk,m = U0,m , for k < 0 and\nUk,m = Um,m , for k > m, then the coproduct on C(U) takes the form\nn \u0012 \u0013\nX\nn\nUr,i \u2297 Ur\u2212i,n\u2212i ,\n\u03b4(Ur,n ) =\ni\ni=0\n\nfor all n \u2265 r \u2265 0.\n\nExample 2.5. The subclass C of U consisting of all circuits and free matroids\nis minor-closed.

Writing\nfn } and K{M\nfr,k }, we\nCn (M) and Cr,k (M), respectively, for the free modules K{M\nhave\nM\nM\nC(M) =\nCn (M) =\nCr,k (M).\nn\u22650\n\nr,k\u22650\n\nProposition 2.6. If M is minor-closed, the families of submodules {Cn (M) : n \u2265\n0} and {Cr,k (M) : r, k \u2265 0} of C(M), respectively, equip C(M) with the structure\nof a graded, and bigraded, coalgebra. If M is also closed under formation of direct\nsums then C(M) is also thus graded, and bigraded, as a Hopf algebra.\nProof. The first claim follows immediately from the fact that, for any matroid\nM = M (S), and A \u2286 S, the rank of M is equal to the sum of the ranks of M |A\nand M/A, and similarly for nullities. The second claim follows from the fact that\nrank and nullity are additive functions with respect to the disjoint sum operation\non matroids.\n\u0003\nProposition 2.7. If M is a minor-closed family and M\u2217 = {M \u2217 : M \u2208 M} then\nf is a\nthe map DM : C(M) \u2192 C(M\u2217 ), determined by M 7\u2192 M \u2217 , for all M \u2208 M,\ncoalgebra antiisomorphism. In particular, if M is closed under duality, then DM is\nan antiautomorphism of C(M).\nProof. The map DM has inverse DM\u2217 , and is thus bijective. For any matroid M =\nM (S), and A \u2286 S, we have the identities (M |A)\u2217 = M \u2217 /(S\\A), and (M/A)\u2217 =\nM \u2217 |(S\\A), from which it follows immediately that \u03b4(DM (M )) = (DM \u2297 DM ) * \u03c4 *\n\u03b4(M ), where \u03c4 : C(M) \u2297 C(M) \u2192 C(M) \u2297 C(M) is the twist map, determined by\nM \u2297 N 7\u2192 N \u2297 M , for all M, N \u2208 M.\n\u0003\n\u0001\nFor all matroids N1 , N2 and M = M (S), the section coefficient N1M,N2 is defined\nas the number of subsets A of S such that M |A \u223c\n= N1 and M/A \u223c\n= N2 ; hence if M\nis a minor-closed family, the coproduct on C(M) is determined by\nX \u0012 M \u0013\n(2.8)\n\u03b4(M ) =\nN1 \u2297 N2 ,\nN1 , N2\nN1 ,N2\n\nfor all M \u2208 M, where the sum is taken over all (isomorphism classes of) matroids\nN1 and N2 . We remark that there is no need to restrict the sum in Equation 2.8 to\nmatroids N1 and N2 belonging to M; because the family M is minor-closed, the\n\n\fA FREE SUBALGEBRA OF THE ALGEBRA OF MATROIDS\n\n5\n\n\u0001\nsection coefficient N1M,N2 is zero whenever N1 or N2 is outside of M. Another way\nof viewing this is the following: If A is the class of all matroids, then the coproduct\nin C(A) is given by Equation 2.8; and if M is any minor-closed class then C(M)\nis a subcoalgebra of C(A) and thus the coproduct on C(M) is given by the same\nformula as that for the coproduct on C(A).\nExample 2.9. Suppose that M (S) is the matroid shown in Figure 2, and that\nN = P2\u0001 \u2295 P2 is the matroid consisting of two double points. The section coefficient\nM\nU2,3 ,N is equal to one (rather than two, as one might first guess) because, although\nthere are two subsets A of S such that M |A \u223c\n= U2,3 , only for A = {a, b, c} do we\nhave M/A \u223c\n= N ; the contraction M/{a, d, e}, is a three point line with one point\ndoubled.\nc \u2022\n\n\u2022 g\n\nb \u2022\na \u2022\n\n\u2022 f\n\u2022\nd\n\u2022\ne\nFigure 2.\n\nMore generally,\u0001 for matroids N1 , . . . , Nk and M = M (S), the multisection coM\nefficient N1 ,...,N\nis defined as the number of sequences (S0 , . . . , Sk ) such that\nk\n\u2205 = S0 \u2286 * * * \u2286 Sk = S and (M |Si )/Si\u22121 \u223c\n= Ni , for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k. Hence the iterated\ncoproduct \u03b4 k : C(M) \u2192 C(M) \u2297 * * * \u2297 C(M) is determined by\n\u0013\nX \u0012\nM\n\u03b4 k (M ) =\nN1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 Nk ,\nN1 , . . . , Nk\nN1 ,...,Nk\n\nfor all M \u2208 M.\n\n3. Algebras of matroids\nf\nf \u2192 K by\nFor any family of matroids M, we define a pairing h*, *i : K{M}\u00d7K{\nM}\nsetting hM, N i equal to the Kronecker delta \u03b4M,N , for all M, N \u2208 M. This pairing\nf \u2297 K{M}\nf with itself, by hM1 \u2297 M2 , N1 \u2297 N2 i =\ndetermines a pairing of K{M}\nhM1 , N1 i * hM2 , N2 i, for all M1 , M2 , N1 , N2 \u2208 M. If M is minor-closed, we may\nf dual to the coproduct on C(M), by setting\nthus define a product on K{M},\n(3.1)\n\nhN1 * N2 , M i = hN1 \u2297 N2 , \u03b4(M )i,\n\nf an associative K-algebra, with unit\nfor all M, N1 , N2 \u2208 M, thus making K{M}\nf equipped with this algebra strucequal to the empty matroid. We denote K{M},\nture, by A(M), and note that A(M) is isomorphic to the graded dual algebra of\nC(M).\n\n\f6\n\nHENRY CRAPO AND WILLIAM SCHMITT\n\nWriting An (M) and Ar,k (M) for the submodules of A(M) generated, respectively, by matroids in M having n-elements, and those having rank r and nullity\nk, we have the direct sum decompositions:\nM\nM\nA(M) =\nAn (M) =\nAr,k (M),\nn\u22650\n\nr,k\u22650\n\nand it follows from Proposition 2.6 that A(M) is thus both a graded and bigraded\nalgebra. We also have the following result, dual to Proposition 2.7.\nProposition 3.2. If M is a minor-closed family and M\u2217 = {M \u2217 : M \u2208 M} then\nf is an\nthe map D : A(M) \u2192 A(M\u2217 ), determined by M 7\u2192 M \u2217 , for all M \u2208 M,\nalgebra antiisomorphism. In particular, if M is closed under duality, then D is an\nantiautomorphism of A(M).\nBy the definition of the pairing, the right-hand side of Equation 3.1 is the coefficient of the basis element N1 \u2297 N2 in the coproduct\u0001 \u03b4(M ) which, as noted in\nEquation 2.8, is given by the section coefficient N1M,N2 . Since the left-hand side\nof (3.1) is the coefficient of the basis element M in the product N1 * N2 , it follows\nthat\nX \u0012 M \u0013\n(3.3)\nN1 * N2 =\nM,\nN1 , N2\nf\nM\u2208M\n\nfor all N1 , N2 \u2208 M. We emphasize that, in Equation 3.3, it is necessary to limit the\nf because C(M) is a subcoalgebra of C(A), where A is\nsummation to elements of M;\nthe family of all matroids, it follows that A(M) is a quotient of the algebra A(A).\nHence the product of N1 and N2 in A(M) is the image of their product in A(A)\nunder the projection homomorphism A(A) \u2192 A(M), which maps all matroids\nf to zero.\nM\u2208\n/M\n\nExample 3.4. Suppose that M is a minor-closed family containing point I and\nloop Z. Then Z * I = I \u2295 Z in A(M). If M contains the double point P2 then\nI * Z = I \u2295 Z + 2P2 ; otherwise, I * Z = I \u2295 Z. If M contains the free matroid In\nthen I n = n!In , and if M contains the zero matroid Zn , we have Z n = n!Zn in\nA(M).\nExample 3.5. Suppose that L is the matroid shown in Figure 1 and that M is the\nmatroid consisting of five points a, b, c, d, e in the plane, with a, b, c collinear. If M\nis any minor-closed family that contains L, M and the direct sum U2,3 \u2295 P2 of the\nthree-point line with a double point, then we have U2,3 * P2 = M + 2L + (U2,3 \u2295 P2 )\nin A(M).\nExample 3.6. If M contains the free matroid Ir and zero matroid Zk , then the\nproduct Ir * Zk in A(M) is given by\nX\nIr * Zk =\n(# of bases of M ) * M,\n\nf having rank r and nullity k. On the\nwhere the sum is over all matroids M \u2208 M\n\u0001\nother hand, for any M \u2208 M and k \u2265 0, the product Zk *M is equal to k+l\nk Zk \u2295 M ,\nwhere l is the number of loops of M if Zk \u2295 M \u2208 M, and is equal to zero otherwise;\nso in particular, Zk * Ir = Zk \u2295 Ir if M contains Zk \u2295 Ir , and Zk * Ir = 0, otherwise.\n\n\fA FREE SUBALGEBRA OF THE ALGEBRA OF MATROIDS\n\n7\n\nExample 3.7. Let C be the minor-closed family consisting of all free matroids In\nand circuits Ck , for n \u2265 0 and k \u2265 1.

Orderings of subsets and words\nFor any set S and r \u2265 0, we denote by B(S) and Br (S), respectively, the set of\nall subsets and the set of all r-element subsets of S. In particular, for all n \u2265 0, we\nwrite B(n) and Br (n), respectively, for B([n]) and Br ([n]), where [n] denotes the\nset {1, . . . , n}. Whenever we write a subset of a linearly ordered set S by listing its\nelements, we shall assume that the list is written in the order induced by S; that\nis, if S is linearly ordered, and A = {a1 , . . . , ar } \u2286 S, then a1 < * * * < ar in S.\nThroughout this paper we shall always assume that S, whether linearly ordered or\nnot, is a finite set.\nFor any linearly ordered S and r \u2265 0, we define a partial order on Br (S) by\nsetting {a1 , . . . , ar } \u2264 {b1 , . . . , br } if and only if ai \u2264 bi in S, for all i \u2208 [r].\nUnder this ordering, Br (S) is a sublattice of the r-fold direct product of linearly\nordered sets S \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 S, and is thus a distributive lattice.

The lattices B2 (a, b, c, d, e) and W5,2\n\n\f8\n\nHENRY CRAPO AND WILLIAM SCHMITT\n\nWe extend the ordering on Br (S) to all of B(S) by setting B \u2265 A in B(S) if and\nonly if B \u2265 A\u2032 in some Br (S), for some subset A\u2032 of A. Hence, if A = {a1 , . . . , ak }\nand B = {b1 , . . . , br }, then A \u2264 B if and only if r \u2264 k and ai \u2264 bi , for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 r.\nEquipped with this ordering, B(S) is a distributive lattice that contains each Br (S)\nas a sublattice.\nLemma 4.1. For any linearly ordered set S, the map B(S) \u2192 B(S) taking A \u2286 S\nto its complement in S is a lattice antiautomorphism.\nProof. Suppose that A = {a1 , . . . , ak } and B = {b1 , . . . , br } are subsets of the\nlinearly ordered set S such that A \u2264 B in B(S), that is, such that r \u2264 k and\nai \u2264 bi , for all i \u2208 [r]. If A\u2032 = {s1 , . . . , sn\u2212k } and B \u2032 = {t1 , . . . , tn\u2212r } are the\ncomplements of A and B in S, then n \u2212 r \u2265 n \u2212 k, and sj = j + |{i : ai < j}|\nand tj = j + |{i : bi < j}|, for all j. Since ai \u2264 bi , for all i \u2208 [r], it follows that\n|{i : ai < j}| \u2265 |{i : bi < j}|, for all j. Hence sj \u2265 tj , for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n \u2212 k, and so\nA\u2032 \u2265 B \u2032 in B(S).\n\u0003\nFor any linearly ordered set S, we denote by S\u03c6 the reversal of S, that is, the\nset S equipped with the opposite ordering: a \u2264 b in S\u03c6 if and only if a \u2265 b in S.\nLemma 4.2. For any linearly ordered set S, the identity map is a lattice antiisomorphism Br (S) \u2192 Br (S\u03c6 ).\nProof. It is immediate from the definition of the ordering on Br (S) that A \u2264 B in\nBr (S) if and only if A \u2265 B in Br (S\u03c6 ).\n\u0003\nGiven a word w on the alphabet {0, 1}, and i \u2208 {0, 1}, we denote by |w|i the\nnumber of occurrences of the letter i in w. For all n \u2265 0, we write Wn for the set\nof all words on {0, 1} having length n, and let Wn,r = {w \u2208 Wn : |w|1 = r}, for\n0 \u2264 r \u2264 n. For any linearly ordered set S = {e1 , . . . , en }, let \u03c7 : B(S) \u2192 Wn be the\nfunction which maps A \u2286 S to the word x1 . . . xn , where\n(\n1, if ei \u2208 A,\nxi =\n0, otherwise.\nNote that \u03c7 maps each Br (S) bijectively onto Wn,r and that, under the natural\nidentification of Wn with the set of functions S \u2192 {0, 1}, the function \u03c7 simply\nmaps subsets of S to their characteristic functions.\nDefine maps \u03c0k : Wn,r \u2192 [n], for 1 \u2264 k \u2264 r, by letting \u03c0k (w) be the position of\nthe k th 1 in w \u2208 Wn,r . It follows that, for S = {e1 , . . . , en }, the map \u03c0 : Wn,r \u2192\nBr (S) which is inverse to \u03c7 is given by \u03c0(w) = {e\u03c01 (w) , . . . , e\u03c0r (w) }, for all w \u2208 Wn,r .\nWe define a partial order on Wn,r by setting v \u2264 w if and only if \u03c0k (v) \u2264 \u03c0k (w), for\n1 \u2264 k \u2264 r. For example, the Hasse diagram of the lattice W5,2 is given in Figure 3.\nLemma 4.3. For any linearly ordered set S, and 1 \u2264 r \u2264 n = |S|, the map\n\u03c7 : Br (S) \u2192 Wn,r is a lattice isomorphism.\nProof. It is immediate from the definition of \u03c7 that A \u2264 B in Br (S) if and only if\n\u03c0k (\u03c7(A)) \u2264 \u03c0k (\u03c7(B)), for 1 \u2264 k \u2264 r.\n\u0003\nLemma 4.4. For all v = x1 * * * xr and w = y1 * * * yr in Wn,r , the inequality v \u2264 w\nholds if and only if |x1 * * * xk |1 \u2265 |y1 * * * yk |1 , for 1 \u2264 k \u2264 r.\nProof. The proof is immediate from the definitions.\n\n\u0003\n\n\fA FREE SUBALGEBRA OF THE ALGEBRA OF MATROIDS\n\n9\n\n5. Freedom Matroids\nBy a flag on a finite set S we shall mean a sequence (S0 , . . . , Sr ) of subsets of\nS such that Sr = S and Si\u22121 is a proper subset of Si , for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 r. We do not\nrequire S0 to be empty.\nProposition 5.1. For any flag (S0 , . . . , Sr ) on a set S, the family\nI = {I \u2286 S : |I \u2229 Si | \u2264 i, for all i}\nis the collection of independent sets of a matroid M (S0 , . . . , Sr ), of rank r, on S.\nProof. It is clear that I contains the empty set and is closed under formation of\nsubsets. Now suppose that I, J \u2208 I with |I| < |J|. If |I \u2229 Si | < i for all i, then for\nany x \u2208 J\\I we have |(I \u222a x) \u2229 Si | \u2264 i for all i, and hence I \u222a x \u2208 I. So we suppose\nthat there exists some i such that |I \u2229 Si | = i, and let m be the maximal such i.\nNote that m < r, since m = |I \u2229 Sm | \u2264 |I| < |J| = |J \u2229 Sr | \u2264 r.\n\u2032\nNow, since |J \u2229 Sm | \u2264 m = |I \u2229 Sm |, and |J| > |I|, we must have |J \u2229 Sm\n|>\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n|I \u2229Sm |, where Sm denotes the complement of Sm in S, and hence the set (J\\I)\u2229Sm\n\u2032\nis nonempty. Let x be any element of (J\\I)\u2229Sm . For m < i \u2264 r, we have |I\u2229Si | < i,\nand thus |(I \u222a x) \u2229 Si | \u2264 i. Since x \u2208\n/ Sm we have (I \u222a x) \u2229 Si = I \u2229 Si , and so\n|(I \u222a x) \u2229 Si | \u2264 i, for all i \u2264 m. Thus I \u222a x \u2208 I.\n\u0003\nWe refer to the matroid M (S0 , . . . , Sr ) as the freedom matroid (see [18]) defined\nby the flag (S0 , . . . , Sr ). Note that it follows immediately from the definition that\neach Sk is a flat of rank k in M (S0 , . . . , Sr ).\nIf M is a matroid on S and e \u2208 S, we denote by M \\e and M/e the matroids\nobtained from M by, respectively, deleting and contracting e.\nProposition 5.2. For any freedom matroid M = M (S0 , . . . , Sr ) and e \u2208 S, the\ndeletion M \\e and contraction M/e are given by\nM \\e = M (T0 , . . . , Tr )\n\nand\n\nM/e = M (T0 , . . . , Tk\u22122 , Tk , . . . , Tr ),\n\nwhere Ti = Si \\e, for all i, and k = min{i : x \u2208 Si }.\nProof. The independent sets of M \\e are the subsets of S that do not contain e and\ncontain no more than i elements of each Si , which are precisely the independent\nsubsets of M (T0 , . . . , Tr ).\nIf e is a loop in M , then M/e = M \\e = M (T0 , . . . , Tr ), which agrees with the\nexpression for M/e given in the Proposition, since k = 0 in this case. If e is not a\nloop, then A is independent in M/e if and only if e \u2208\n/ A and A \u222a e is independent\nin M , that is |(A \u222a e) \u2229 Si | \u2264 i, for all i; in other words, |A \u2229 Ti | \u2264 i, for i < k,\nand |A \u2229 Ti | \u2264 i \u2212 1, for i \u2265 k. Since Tk\u22121 \u2286 Tk , the condition |A \u2229 Tk | \u2264 k \u2212 1\nimplies that |A \u2229 Tk\u22121 | \u2264 k \u2212 1 and hence the latter inequality is redundant.\nThus A is independent in M/e if and only if |A \u2229 Ti | \u2264 i for 0 \u2264 i \u2264 k \u2212 2 and\n|A \u2229 Ti | \u2264 i \u2212 1, for k \u2264 i \u2264 r; equivalently, if and only if A is independent in\nM (T0 , . . . , Tk\u22122 , Tk , . . . , Tr ).\n\u0003\nCorollary 5.3 ([17]). The class of freedom matroids is minor-closed.\nWe now characterize the closure operators and closed sets of freedom matroids.\nWe begin with the following proposition.\nProposition 5.4. The closure of an independent set A in a freedom matroid M =\nM (S0 , . . . , Sr ) is given by clM (A) = A \u222a Sm , where m = max{i : |A \u2229 Si | = i}.\n\n\f10\n\nHENRY CRAPO AND WILLIAM SCHMITT\n\nProof. First note that |A \u2229 S0 | = 0, because A is independent, and thus such m\nexists. Now, since |A \u2229 Sm | = m, the set A \u222a x is dependent for all x \u2208 Sm \\A,\nand thus Sm \u2286 clM (A). On the other hand, for any y \u2208\n/ A \u222a Sm , the set A \u222a y is\nindependent, since |(A \u222a y) \u2229 Si | = |A \u2229 Si | \u2264 i, for i \u2264 m and |(A \u222a y) \u2229 Si | \u2264\n1 + |A \u2229 Si | \u2264 i, for i > m; hence clM (A) \u2286 A \u222a Sm .\n\u0003\nWe may thus find the closure of an arbitrary set A in a freedom matroid by\napplying Proposition 5.4 to any maximal independent subset B of A and using the\nfact that cl(B) = cl(A).\nProposition 5.5. A set F \u2286 S is closed in M (S0 , . . . , Sr ) if and only if F = A\u222aSm ,\nfor some m \u2265 0 and A \u2286 S\\Sm such that |A \u2229 Si | < i \u2212 m, for all i > m; in which\ncase the rank of F is m + |A|.\nProof. Suppose that F is closed and that B is a basis for F . By Proposition 5.4,\nF = cl(B) = B \u222a Sm for some m such that |B \u2229 Sm | = m and |B \u2229 Si | < i, for all\ni > m. Letting A = B\\Sm , we thus have F = A \u222a Sm and |A \u222a Si | < i \u2212 m, for all\ni > m.\nOn the other hand, suppose that F = A \u222a Sm for some m \u2265 0 and A \u2286 S\\Sm ,\nsuch that |A \u222a Si | < i \u2212 m, for all i > m. Let B be a basis for Sm . Since\nA is disjoint from Sm , and thus also from B, and |B| = m, it follows from the\nabove inequality that |(A \u222a B) \u2229 Si | \u2264 i, for i > m, and hence that A \u222a B is\nindependent. Since m = max{i : |(A \u222a B) \u2229 Si | = i}, it follows from Proposition\n5.4 that A \u222a Sm = cl(A \u222a B), and is thus closed.\n\u0003\nNote that if we are given a closed set F in M (S0 , . . . , Sr ), we can express F as\nA \u222a Sm , according to Proposition 5.5, by letting m = max{i : Si \u2286 F }, and taking\nA = F \\Sm .\nCorollary 5.6. If F is any flat of rank k in M (S0 , . . . , Sr ), then |F | \u2264 |Sk |.\nProof. By Proposition 5.5, if F is a flat of rank k in M (S0 , . . . , Sr ) then F = Sm \u222aA,\nfor some m and A \u2286 S\\Sm with |A| = k \u2212 m. Since |Sk | \u2212 |Sm | \u2265 k \u2212 m, it follows\nthat |F | = |Sm | + |A| = |Sm | + k \u2212 m \u2264 |Sk |.\n\u0003\n6. Freedom matroids on ordered sets\nIn the case that S is linearly ordered it is convenient to consider flags (S0 , . . . , Sr )\nsuch that each Si is an initial segment in the ordering of S. In this case, the flag\n(S0 , . . . , Sr ) is determined by S together with the set {1 + max Si : 0 \u2264 i \u2264 r \u2212 1}.\nHence if S is linearly ordered and we are given a subset T = {t1 , . . . , tr } of S, we\nmay obtain a flag (T0 , . . . , Tr ) on S by setting Tr = S and Ti = {s \u2208 S : s < ti+1 },\nfor 0 \u2264 i \u2264 r \u2212 1. We denote the freedom matroid M (T0 , . . . , Tr ) by MT (S), or\nsimply MT , when the set S is understood. If T \u2286 [n] and S = {e1 , . . . , en }, we\nalso write MT (S) for the matroid M\u03b1(T ) (S), where \u03b1 : B(n) \u2192 B(S) is the natural\nbijection i 7\u2192 ei .\nProposition 6.1. If S is linearly ordered and T \u2286 S, then the family of independent sets of MT = MT (S) is given by {A \u2286 S : A \u2265 T in B(S)}. If |T | = r, then\nthe family of bases of MT is given by {B : B \u2265 T in Br (S)}.\nProof. Suppose that T = {t1 , . . . , tr } and A = {a1 , . . . , ak } in B(S). Since Tr = S,\nwe have A = A \u2229 Tr , and thus |A \u2229 Tr | \u2264 r if and only if k \u2264 r. Now for 0 \u2264 i \u2264 r,\n\n\fA FREE SUBALGEBRA OF THE ALGEBRA OF MATROIDS\n\n11\n\nwe have A \u2229 Ti = {aj \u2208 A : aj < ti+1 in S}; therefore, since a1 < * * * < ak and\nt1 < * * * < tr , it follows that |A \u2229 Ti | \u2264 i if and only if ai+1 \u2265 ti+1 . Hence A is\nindependent in MT if and only if A \u2265 T in B(S).\n\u0003\nExample 6.2. Suppose that S = {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} and T = {b, e, f }. Then MT =\nM (T0 , T1 , T2 , T3 ), where T0 = {a}, T1 = {a, b, c, d}, T2 = {a, b, c, d, e} and T3 = S.\nThe bases of MT are the sets {b, e, f }, {c, e, f }, {d, e, f }, {b, e, g}, {c, e, g}, {d, e, g},\n{b, f, g}, {c, f, g}, {d, f, g} and {e, f, g}.\nProposition 6.3. For any linearly ordered S, and T \u2286 S, the dual MT (S)\u2217 of the\nmatroid MT (S) is equal to MT \u2032 (S\u03c6 ), where T \u2032 is the complement of T in S and S\u03c6\nis the reversal of S. In particular, the class of freedom matroids is closed under\nduality.\nProof. Suppose that |S| = n and |T | = r. It follows from Proposition 6.1 that\nthe set of bases of MT (S)\u2217 is given by {B \u2032 : B \u2265 T in Br (S)}, which, according to\nLemma 4.1, is equal to {C : C \u2264 T \u2032 in Bn\u2212r (S)}. By Lemma 4.2, we have C \u2264 T \u2032\nin Bn\u2212r (S) if and only C \u2265 T \u2032 in Bn\u2212r (S\u03c6 ), and hence the result follows from\nProposition 6.1.\n\u0003\nThe following Lemma, which is a corollary of Proposition 6.1, will be used in the\nnext section.\nLemma 6.4. Suppose that M (S) = M (S0 , . . . , Sr ) is a freedom matroid, where S\nis linearly ordered and each Si is an initial segment in S, and let A \u2286 S and a \u2208 A.\nIf b \u2208 S\\A satisfies b > a in S, then \u03c1((A\\a) \u222a b) \u2265 \u03c1(A).\nProof. Let B be a maximal independent subset of A that contains a. Since b > a\nin S, it follows that (B\\a) \u222a b > B in B(S). Hence, by Proposition 6.1, the set\n(B\\a) \u222a b is independent in M , and so \u03c1((A\\a) \u222a b) \u2265 \u03c1(A).\n\u0003\nRecall from Section 4 that, given a word w \u2208 Wn,r , and 1 \u2264 k \u2264 r, we denote\nby \u03c0k (w) the position of the k th 1 in w, and for S = {e1 , . . . , en }, the bijection\n\u03c0 : Wn,r \u2192 Br (S) is given by \u03c0(w) = {e\u03c01 (w) , . . . , e\u03c0r (w) }. We thus may define a\nmapping w 7\u2192 Mw from Wn,r to the set of rank r freedom matroids on S by setting\nMw = M\u03c0(w) (S), for all w \u2208 Wn,r .\nExample 6.5. If S = {a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l} and w = 001011001000, then\n\u03c0(w) = {c, e, f, i}. The sets Si may be read off from the following table:\nw:\nS0 :\nS1 :\nS2 :\nS3 :\nS4 :\n\n0\na\na\na\na\na\n\n0 1\nb\nb c\nb c\nb c\nb c\n\n0\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1 0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nd\nd\nd\nd\n\ne\ne\ne\n\nf\nf\n\ng\ng\n\nh\nh\n\ni\n\nk\n\nl,\n\nj\n\nand Mw = M{c,e,f,i} is the freedom matroid M (S0 , S1 , S2 , S3 , S4 ).\nWhen freedom matroids were first introduced, in [10], they were given the following recursive construction by single-element extensions: If w is the empty word,\nthen Mw is the empty matroid, and for w = vx, where |x| = 1, Mw is obtained\nfrom Mv as follows:\n(i) If x = 1, add a point independently to Mv in a new dimension, that is, let\n\n\f12\n\nHENRY CRAPO AND WILLIAM SCHMITT\n\nMw = Mv \u2295 I;\n(ii) If x = 0, add a point e to Mv in general position in the top rank, that is, let\nMw be the free extension of Mv by e.\nExample 6.6. If w = 001001010010 and S = {a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l}, then\nMw consists of loops a and b, together with a triple point {c, d, e}, collinear with\ndistinct points f and g, this line being coplanar with general points h,i,j, with two\nadditional points k and l in general position in 3-space.\n7. Matroids and words\nSuppose that M is a matroid of rank r on an n-element set S, having rank\nfunction \u03c1. We associate to any maximal chain \u2205 = A0 \u2282 * * * \u2282 An = S in the\nBoolean algebra 2S the word x1 * * * xn \u2208 Wn,r defined by xi = \u03c1(Ai ) \u2212 \u03c1(Ai\u22121 ),\nfor all i \u2208 [n]. If the set S = {e1 , . . . , en } is linearly ordered, then there is a\ndistinguished maximal chain A0 \u2282 * * * \u2282 An in 2S , given by Ai = {e1 , . . . , ei }, for\nall i \u2208 [n]. The word wM (S) = x1 * * * xn associated to this chain is thus determined\nby\n(\n0, if ei \u2208 cl({e1 , . . . , ei\u22121 }),\nxi =\n1, otherwise,\nfor all i \u2208 [n]. We refer to wM (S) as the distinguished word of M (S). Note that\nwM (S) is also determined by the equality |x1 * * * xi |1 = \u03c1({e1 , . . . , ei }), for all i \u2208 [n].\nLemma 7.1. For any matroid M (S) of rank r, with S linearly ordered of cardinality n, the word w = wM (S) is determined by condition that \u03c0(w) = min{B \u2208\nBr (S) : B is a basis for M }.\nProof. Suppose S = {e1 , . . . , en }, and that the 1's in w occur in positions i1 , . . . , ir ,\nso that \u03c0(w) = {ei1 , . . . , eir }. Since eik is not in the closure of {e1 , . . . , eik \u22121 },\nfor all k \u2208 [r], it follows that \u03c0(w) is independent, and thus is a basis for M . If\nB = {b1 , . . . , br } \u2286 S is such that k \u2264 ik , for some k \u2208 [r], then {b1 , . . . , bk } \u2286\n{e1 , . . . , eik \u22121 }, which has rank k \u2212 1, and so B is not a basis for M . Hence any\nbasis B of M satisfies B \u2265 \u03c0(w) in Br (S).\n\u0003\nIf S = {e1 , . . . , en } is linearly ordered, then the symmetric group \u03a3n acts naturally on S by \u03c3(ei ) = e\u03c3(i) , for all i \u2208 [n], and thus we can identify \u03a3n with\nthe group \u03a3S of permutations of S. For any \u03c3 in \u03a3S (or in \u03a3n ), we denote by\nS\u03c3 the underlying set of S equipped with the linear order (or reorder) given by\n\u03c3(e1 ) < * * * < \u03c3(en ). Hence, a \u2264 b in S if and only if \u03c3(a) \u2264 \u03c3(b) in S\u03c3 , and so\n\u03c3 : S \u2192 S\u03c3 is a poset isomorphism. The natural map B(S) \u2192 B(S\u03c3 ), given by\nA 7\u2192 \u03c3(A), for all A \u2286 S, and also denoted by \u03c3, is also a poset isomorphism. We\ndenote by \u03c0\u03c3 the map Wn,r \u2192 Br (S\u03c3 ), which takes a word to the subset of S\u03c3\ncorresponding to positions of its 1's. Note that \u03c0\u03c3 is equal to the composition \u03c3\u03c0.\nGiven A, B \u2286 S of equal cardinality, with complements A\u2032 and B \u2032 in [n], the\nshuffle \u03c3A,B \u2208 \u03a3S is the unique permutation of S which maps B onto A, and\nthus also B \u2032 onto A\u2032 , whose restrictions to B and B \u2032 are order-preserving. For\nexample, if A = {4, 7} and B = {1, 5} in S = [7], then \u03c3A,B = 4123756 (where\n\u03c3 = \u03c31 * * * \u03c3n \u2208 \u03a3n is the usual word notation for permutations, indicating that\n\u03c3(i) = \u03c3i , for all i), or in cycle notation, \u03c3A,B = (1432)(576).\n\n\fA FREE SUBALGEBRA OF THE ALGEBRA OF MATROIDS\n\n13\n\nLemma 7.2. Suppose that S is linearly ordered, and that A \u2265 B in B(S), where\n|A| = |B|, and let \u03c3 = \u03c3A,B \u2208 \u03a3S be the shuffle. If C \u2286 S satisfies C \u2265 A in B(S),\nthen C \u2265 A in B(S\u03c3 ).\nProof. Suppose that the complements of A = {a1 , * * * , ar } and B = {b1 , . . . , br }\nin S are A\u2032 = {a\u20321 , * * * , a\u2032k } and B \u2032 = {b\u20321 , . . . , b\u2032k }, respectively, so that the shuffle\n\u03c3 = \u03c3A,B is given by bi 7\u2192 ai and b\u2032j 7\u2192 a\u2032j , for all i \u2208 [r] and j \u2208 [k]. Since\n\u03c3 : B(S) \u2192 B(S\u03c3 ) is an isomorphism, it follows that for any C \u2286 S, we have\nC \u2265 A in B(S\u03c3 ) if and only if \u03c3 \u22121 (C) \u2265 \u03c3 \u22121 (A) = B in B(S). Now suppose\nthat C = {c1 , . . . , cm } \u2265 A in B(S), so that m \u2264 r and ci \u2265 ai , for all i \u2208 [m].\nSince A \u2265 B in B(S), it follows from Lemma 4.1 that A\u2032 \u2264 B \u2032 in B(S). Hence\n\u03c3 \u22121 (a) \u2264 a, for all a \u2208 A, and \u03c3 \u22121 (a\u2032 ) \u2265 a\u2032 , for all a\u2032 \u2208 A\u2032 . Consider ci \u2208 C. If\nci \u2208 A\u2032 , then \u03c3 \u22121 (ci ) \u2265 ci \u2265 ai \u2265 bi . On the other hand, if ci \u2208 A, then ci = aj , for\nsome j \u2265 i (since ci \u2265 ai ), and so \u03c3 \u22121 (ci ) = \u03c3 \u22121 (aj ) = bj \u2265 bi . Hence \u03c3 \u22121 (C) \u2265 B\nin B(S), and therefore C \u2265 A in B(S\u03c3 ).\n\u0003\nFor any matroid M (S) of rank r, where S is linearly ordered of cardinality n,\nwe define a mapping \u03bbM : \u03a3S \u2192 Wn,r (or equivalently, \u03bbM : \u03a3n \u2192 Wn,r ) by setting\n\u03bbM (\u03c3) = wM (S\u03c3 ) , for all \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a3S . Note that, in particular, if \u03b9 \u2208 \u03a3S is the identity\npermutation, then \u03bbM (\u03b9) = wM (S) is the distinguished word of M (S). We emphasize\nthat the map \u03bbM depends not only on the matroid M = M (S), but on the linear\nordering of S.\nFor example, if M is the matroid on S = {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} shown in Figure 2,\nand \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a37 is the permutation 6237154, then \u03bbM (\u03c3) = 1110010.\nProposition 7.3. Suppose that M (S) is a rank r matroid, with S an n-element\nlinearly ordered set. If v \u2264 wM (S) in Wn,r , then \u03bbM (\u03c3A,B ) = v, where A = \u03c0(wM (S) )\nand B = \u03c0(v).\nProof. By Lemma 7.1, A = \u03c0(wM (S) ) is the minimum basis of M in Br (S). Since\nA \u2265 B = \u03c0(v) in Br (S), it follows from Lemma 7.2 that A is also the minimum basis\nof M in Br (S\u03c3 ), where \u03c3 is the shuffle \u03c3A,B . Since A = \u03c3(B) = \u03c3(\u03c0(v)) = \u03c0\u03c3 (v), it\nthus follows from Lemma 7.1 that v = wM (S\u03c3 ) , that is, \u03bbM (\u03c3) = v.\n\u0003\nCorollary 7.4. For any rank r matroid M on an n-element linearly ordered set,\nthe image of \u03bbM is an order ideal in Wn,r .\nProof. The proof is immediate from Proposition 7.3.\n\n\u0003\n\nIt was shown in [10] (Theorem: \"Existence of a matroid with a given first word\")\nthat in the case in which M = Mw is a freedom matroid, the word w is the\nmaximum among words associated to M by the map \u03bbM . The following theorem is\na strengthening of this result, giving a characterization of the words in the image\nof \u03bbM whenever M is a freedom matroid.\nTheorem 7.5. If M is the freedom matroid Mw for some w \u2208 Wn,r , then the\nimage of \u03bbM : \u03a3n \u2192 Wn,r is the principal order ideal {v \u2208 Wn,r : v \u2264 w}.\nProof. Suppose that M = M (S) = Mw , where S = {e1 , . . . , en } and w = x1 * * * xn\nbelongs to Wn,r . It follows that M = M (S0 , . . . , Sr ), where Sr = S, and Sk\u22121 =\n{e1 , . . . , e\u03c0k (w)\u22121 }, for 1 \u2264 k \u2264 r. For any \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a3n , the word \u03bbM (\u03c3) = y1 * * * yn is\ndetermined by the condition that |y1 * * * yi |1 = \u03c1({e\u03c3(1) , . . . , e\u03c3(i) }), for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n,\nand by Corollary 5.6, if \u03c1({e\u03c3(1) , . . . , e\u03c3(i) }) = k, for some i, then i \u2264 |Sk | =\n\n\f14\n\nHENRY CRAPO AND WILLIAM SCHMITT\n\n\u03c0k+1 (w) \u2212 1. Since \u03c0k+1 (w) is the position of the (k + 1)st one in w, it follows\nthat |x1 * * * xi |1 \u2264 k = |y1 * * * yi |1 . Hence, by Lemma 4.4, we have \u03bbM (\u03c3) \u2264 w. The\nresult thus follows from Corollary 7.4.\n\u0003\nExample 7.6. Suppose that M (S) = U2,4 \u2295 P2 is the matroid consisting of a fourpoint line and a double point. The image of \u03bbM in W6,3 (given any linear ordering on\nS) is the order ideal {111000, 110100, 101100, 110010}, which has maximal elements\n110010 and 101100, and thus is not principal. Hence, it follows from Theorem 7.5\nthat M is not a freedom matroid.\nCorollary 7.7 ([10]). There are precisely 2n nonisomorphic freedom matroids (and\nthus at least 2n nonisomorphic matroids) on an n-element set.\nProof. Given a matroid M on S, the definition of \u03bbM depends on a choice of ordering\nof S, but the image of \u03bbM depends only on the isomorphism class of M . Hence, by\nTheorem 7.5, if v 6= w, then the freedom matroids Mv and Mw are not isomorphic.\n\u0003\nRecall that the Bruhat order (or strong Bruhat order) on \u03a3n is determined by\nthe condition that \u03c3 covers \u03c4 = \u03c41 . . . \u03c4n in \u03a3n if and only if \u03c3 may be obtained\nfrom \u03c4 by reversing a single pair (\u03c4i , \u03c4j ), such that i < j and \u03c4i < \u03c4j and the\nnumber of inversions of \u03c3 is one greater than the number of inversions of \u03c4 . Under\nthe assumptions i < j and \u03c4i < \u03c4j , the exchange (\u03c4i , \u03c4j ) increases the number of\ninversions by one if and only if, for all k with i < k < j, either \u03c4k < \u03c4i or \u03c4k > \u03c4j ,\nwhich, in particular, is the case if either j = i + 1 or \u03c4j = \u03c4i + 1. For example,\nin the Bruhat order on \u03a34 , the permutation 1423 is covered by 4123, 2413 and\n1432. Reversing the pair (1, 3) in 1423 creates three new inversions, so that, even\nthough 3421 is greater than 1423, it is not a cover. The identity permutation is\nthe minimum element of \u03a3n , and the flip map \u03c6 = n(n \u2212 1) * * * 1 is the maximum\nelement.\nProposition 7.8. If M = Mw for any w \u2208 Wn,r , and \u03a3n is given the Bruhat\norder, then \u03bbM : \u03a3n \u2192 Wn,r is an order-reversing map.\nProof. Suppose that Mw = M (S) = M (S0 , . . . , Sr ), where S is linearly ordered\nand each Si is an initial segment in S. Suppose that \u03c4 covers \u03c3 in the Bruhat order\non \u03a3n and let S\u03c3 = {e1 , . . . , en } and S\u03c4 = {f1 , . . . , fn }, so that ek = fk for all but\ntwo indices i and j, where\ni < j,\n\nei < ej ,\n\nfj = ei ,\n\nand fi = ej .\n\nLetting Ek = {e1 , . . . , ek } and Fk = {f1 , . . . , fk }, for all k \u2208 [n], we have Ek = Fk ,\nfor 1 \u2264 k < i and j < k \u2264 n, and since ej > ei in S, it follows from Lemma 6.4 that\n\u03c1(Fk ) \u2265 \u03c1(Ek ), for i \u2264 k \u2264 j. Letting \u03bbM (\u03c3) = x1 * * * xn and \u03bbM (\u03c4 ) = y1 * * * yn ,\nwe thus have |x1 * * * xk |1 = \u03c1(Ek ) \u2264 \u03c1(Fk ) = |y1 * * * yk |1 , for all k \u2208 [n], and hence\n\u03bbM (\u03c3) \u2265 \u03bbM (\u03c4 ), by Lemma 4.4.\n\u0003\nExample 7.9. Suppose that S = {a, b, c, d} and M (S) = M0101 , so that a is a\nloop, {b, c} a double point and d an isthmus in M . The image of \u03bbM : \u03a34 \u2192 W4,2\nis the order ideal {1100, 0110, 1001, 1010}, and under \u03bbM , the two permutations in\nthe interval [1234, 1324] of \u03a34 map to 0101, the four permutations in the interval\n[1243, 1432] map to 0110, the four permutations in the interval [2134, 3214] map to\n1001, the set {\u03c3 : \u03c3 \u2265 2143 and either \u03c3 \u2264 3241 or \u03c3 \u2264 4132} maps to 1010, and\nthe interval [2413, 4321] maps to 1100.\n\n\fA FREE SUBALGEBRA OF THE ALGEBRA OF MATROIDS\n\n15\n\n8.

Observe that c(w, v) is\nwe write c(w, v) for the multisection coefficient x1 ,...,x\nn\nequal to the number of permutations \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a3n such that \u03bbMv (\u03c3) = w, and hence\nTheorem 7.5 implies that c(w, v) is nonzero if and only if w \u2264 v in the lattice\nordering of Wn,r . We thus have\nX\n(8.2)\nPw =\nc(w, v)Mv ,\nv\u2265w\n\nfor all w \u2208 Wn,r , where all coefficients are nonzero. Because c(w, v) = 0, whenever\nw 6\u2264 v, the function c belongs to the incidence algebra of Wn,r . Since c(w, w) 6= 0\nfor all w, and K is a field of characteristic zero, it follows that c has a convolution\ninverse c\u22121 , and therefore\nX\nMw =\nc\u22121 (w, v)Pv ,\nv\u2265w\n\n\f16\n\nHENRY CRAPO AND WILLIAM SCHMITT\n\nfor all w \u2208 Wn,r . Hence the linear endomorphism of Ar,n\u2212r (F ) determined by\nMw 7\u2192 Pw , for all w \u2208 Wn,r , is invertible, and so {Pw : w \u2208 Wn,r } is a basis for\nAr,n\u2212r (F ).\n\u0003\nNote that, since Pv * Pw = Pvw in A(F ), for all v, w \u2208 W, Theorem 8.1 can be\nrestated as the fact that the map Pw 7\u2192 w defines an isomorphism from A(F ) onto\nthe free algebra K{W} = Kh{0, 1}i, which has concatenation of words as product.\nThe use of incidence algebras in the proof of Theorem 8.1 can be avoided as\nfollows: Choose an ordering w1 , * * * , wm of Wn,r such that i \u2264 j, whenever wi \u2264 wj\nin Wn,r (such as the opposite ofPlexicographic order) and set cij = c(wi , wj ), for\nm\nall i \u2264 j in [m]. Then Pwi =\nj=1 cij Mwj , for all i, and by Theorem 7.5, the\nmatrix C = (cij )1\u2264i,j\u2264m is upper-triangular, with nonzero entries along the main\ndiagonal. Since K is a characteristic zero field, C is thus invertible, and hence the\nset {Pwi : 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m} is a basis for Ar,n\u2212r (F ).\nCorollary 8.3. If M is any minor-closed family that contains the class F of freedom matroids, then the subalgebra of A(M) generated by I and Z is free.\nProof. For each word w = x1 * * * xn \u2208 W, let Qw denote the product Mx1 * * * Mxn\nin A(M). Since F \u2286 M, the algebra A(F ) is a quotient of A(M), where the\ncanonical homomorphism \u03c0 : A(M) \u2192 A(F ) maps every freedom matroid in M to\nitself and every nonfreedom matroid to zero. Since \u03c0(Qw ) = Pw , for all w \u2208 W\nand, by Theorem 8.1, the Pw are linearly independent in A(F ), it follows that the\nQw are linearly independent in A(M). Hence the subalgebra of A(M) generated\nby I and Z is free.\n\u0003\nExample 8.4. If S = {a, b, c, d}, then the basis {Mw : w \u2208 W4,2 } of A2,2 (F )\nconsists of the following matroids:\nM1100\nM1010\nM1001\nM0110\nM0101\nM0011\n\n= U2,4\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\na, b, c, d collinear\n{a, b} a double-point, collinear with points c and d\n{a, b, c} a triple-point, d a distinct point\na a loop, b, c, d collinear\na a loop, {b, c} a double-point, d a distinct point\na and b loops, c and d distinct points\n\nP3 \u2295 I\nZ \u2295 U2,3\nI \u2295 P2 \u2295 Z\nZ2 \u2295 I2\n\nListing W4,2 in opposite lexicographic order, W4,2 = {w1 , w2 , w3 , w4 , w5 , w6 } =\n{1100, 1010, 1001, 0110, 0101, 0011}, the matrix C of multisection coefficients cij is\ngiven by\n1100\n\n\uf8eb\n\n1010 \uf8ec\n\n\uf8ec\n1001 \uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n0110 \uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n0101 \uf8ed\n0011\n\n1100\n\n1010\n\n1001\n\n0110\n\n0101\n\n0011\n\n24\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n20\n4\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n12\n6\n6\n0\n0\n0\n\n12\n6\n0\n6\n0\n0\n\n8\n6\n4\n4\n2\n0\n\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\nSo, for example, P1001 = I * Z * Z * I is equal to 6M1001 + 4M0101 + 4M0011 in A(F ).\nObserve that c34 is the only zero entry above the main diagonal C, which corresponds to the fact that w3 = 1001 and w4 = 0110 are the only two noncomparable\nelements of the lattice W4,2 . Also note that, since the matrix entry c(v, w) is equal\n\n\fA FREE SUBALGEBRA OF THE ALGEBRA OF MATROIDS\n\n17\n\nto the number of orderings of the underlying set of Mw with corresponding word\nequal to v, the sum of the entries in each column of C is equal to 4!.\nExample 8.5. Suppose that M is any minor-closed class containing all freedom\nmatroids and the smallest nonfreedom matroid D = P2 \u2295 P2 , consisting of two\ndouble-points, and let P L(M) be the subalgebra of A(M) generated by I and Z.\nThe matrix expressing the basis {Qw : w \u2208 W4,2 } of P L(M) \u2229 A2,2 (M) in terms\nf2,2 = {D} \u222a {Mw : w \u2208 W4,2 } of A2,2 (M) is given by\nof the basis M\n1100\n\n\uf8eb\n\n1010 \uf8ec\n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n0110 \uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n0101 \uf8ed\n1001 \uf8ec\n0011\n\n1100\n\n1010\n\n24\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n20\n4\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\nD\n16\n8\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n1001\n\n0110\n\n0101\n\n0011\n\n12\n6\n6\n0\n0\n0\n\n12\n6\n0\n6\n0\n0\n\n8\n6\n4\n4\n2\n0\n\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\nIn this context, Corollary 8.3 amounts to the observation that this matrix contains\nas a submatrix the nonsingular matrix C in the previous example, and thus has\nindependent rows.\nWe now turn our attention to the coalgebra C(F ) of freedom matroids. Recall\nfrom Section 2 that C(F ) has as basis the set Fe = {Mw : w \u2208 W} of all isomorphism classes of freedom matroids, and has coproduct determined by Equation 2.8,\nso that\nX \u0012w \u0013\n\u03b4(Mw ) =\nMu \u2297 Mv ,\nu, v\nu,v\u2208W\n\nfor all w \u2208 W. Hence if we define\non the vector space K{W}, having all\n\u0001\nP a coproduct\nw\n0,1-words as basis, by \u03b4(w) = u,v u,v\nu\u2297v, then K{W} and C(F ) are isomorphic\ncoalgebras via the mapping Mw 7\u2192 w. For example,\n\u03b4(1010) = 1010 \u2297 \u2205 + 2 (101 \u2297 0) + 2 (110 \u2297 0) + 10 \u2297 10\n+ 5 (11 \u2297 00) + 2 (1 \u2297 100) + 2 (1 \u2297 010) + \u2205 \u2297 1010.\nIt is then an interesting exercise to give a description of this coproduct solely in\nterms of the combinatorics of words.\nLet {Pw\u2032 : w \u2208 W} be the basis of C(F ) which is dual to the basis {Pw : w \u2208 W}\nof A(F ) via the pairing defined in the beginning of Section 3, that is, such that\nhPw\u2032 , Pv i = \u03b4w,v , for all v, w \u2208 W. Equation 8.2 means that hMv , Pw i = c(w, v), for\nall v, w \u2208 W, and so we have\nX\nX\nMw =\nhMw , Pv iPv\u2032 =\nc(v, w)Pv\u2032\nv\u2208W\n\nv\u2264w\n\nfor all w \u2208 W. Hence if |w| = n, and we write \u03bb for \u03bbMw , we have\nX\n\u2032\nMw =\n.\nP\u03bb(\u03c3)\n\u03c3\u2208\u03a3n\n\n\u2032\nFor example, referring to the matrix C in Example 8.4, we see that M0110 = 12P1100\n+\n\u2032\n\u2032\n6P1010 + 6P0110 in C(F ).\n\n\f18\n\nHENRY CRAPO AND WILLIAM SCHMITT\n\nCorollary 8.6. The coalgebra C(F ) has basis {Pw\u2032 : w \u2208 W} and coproduct given\nby\nX\n\u03b4(Pw\u2032 ) =\nPu\u2032 \u2297 Pv\u2032 ,\nuv=w\n\nfor all w \u2208 W.\n\nProof. The result follows immediately from Theorem 8.1 by duality.\n\n\u0003\n\nCorollary 8.6 can be restated as saying that the map determined by Pw\u2032 7\u2192 w is\na coalgebra isomorphism from C(F ) onto\nP the cofree coalgebra K{W}, which has\nthe deconcatenation coproduct \u03b4(w) = uv=w u \u2297 v.\nReferences\n\n1.
