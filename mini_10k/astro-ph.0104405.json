We present our recent revision of model constructions for\nthe horizontal-branch (HB) morphology of globular clusters, which suggests the HB morphology is more sensitive to age compared to our earlier\nmodels. We also present our high precision CCD photometry for the classic second parameter pair M3 and M13. The relative age dating based on\nthis photometry indicates that M13 is indeed older than M3 by 1.7 Gyr.\nThis is consistent with the age difference predicted from our new models,\nwhich provides a further support that the HB morphology is a reliable\nage indicator in most population II stellar systems.\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nBecause the horizontal-branch (HB) stars in globular clusters are much brighter\nthan main-sequence (MS) stars, the interpretation of HB morphology in terms\nof relative age differences would be of great value in the study of distant stellar\npopulations where the MS turnoff is fainter than the detection limit. In this\npaper, we report our progress in the use of HB as a reliable age indicator.\n2.\n\nNew HB Population Models\n\nSome seven years ago, Lee et al. (1994, hereafter LDZ) have concluded that age\nis the most natural candidate for the global second parameter, because other\ncandidates can be ruled out from the observational evidence, while supporting\nevidence do exist for the age hypothesis. Although this conclusion is generally\naccepted in the community, there is still some debate about this issue (see Table\n1 of Lee et al. 1999). Among others, critics are arguing that the relative age\ndifferences inferred from the MS turnoffs are often too small compared to the\namounts predicted from the HB models for the several second parameter pairs,\nincluding the well-known M3 and M13 pair.\nWe found, however, several recent developments can affect the relative age\ndating technique from HB morphology. First of all, there is now a reason to\nbelieve that absolute age of the oldest Galactic globular clusters is reduced to\n1\n\n\fHB Morphology as an Age Indicator\n\n2\n\nabout 12 Gyr, as suggested by new Hipparcos distance calibration and other\nimprovements in stellar models (Reid 1997; Gratton et al. 1997; Chaboyer et\nal. 1998). As LDZ already demonstrated in their paper, this has a strong\nimpact in the relative age estimation from HB morphology. Also, it is now\nwell established that \u03b1 elements are enhanced in halo populations ([\u03b1/Fe] =\n0.4). Finally, Reimers'(1975) empirical mass-loss law suggests more mass-loss at\nlarger ages. The result of this effect was also presented in LDZ, but unfortunately\nmost widely used diagram (their Fig. 7) is the one based on fixed mass-loss. We\nfound all of the above effects make the HB morphology to be more sensitive to\nage (see Lee & Yoon 2001 for details). Therefore, as illustrated in Figure 1 ,\nnow the required age difference is much reduced compared to Figure 7 of LDZ.\nNow, only 1.1 Gyr of age difference, rather than 2 Gyr, is enough to explain\nthe systematic shift of the HB morphology between the inner and outer halo\nclusters. Also, to within the observational uncertainty, age difference of about\n1.5-2 Gyr is now enough to explain the observed difference in HB morphology\nbetween the remote halo clusters (Pal 3, Pal 4, Pal 14, and Eridanus) and M3.\nThese values are consistent with the recent relative age datings both from the\nHST and high-quality ground-based data.\n\nFigure 1.\nNew HB population models are more sensitive to age compared to our earlier models. \u2206t = 0 corresponds to the mean age of\nthe inner halo (R < 8 Kpc) clusters, and the relative ages are in Gyr.\n\n3.\n\nCase of M3 and M13\n\nWe obtained high quality color-magnitude data for the classic second parameter\nglobular clusters M3 and M13. The clusters were observed during the same\n\n\fHB Morphology as an Age Indicator\n\n3\n\nnights with the same instruments (MDM 2.4m), allowing us to determine the\naccurate relative ages. From the color difference method between the turnoff\nand the base of the red giant-branch (RGB), we now confirm M13 is indeed\n1.7\u00b10.5 Gyr older than M3 (Fig. 2; see Rey et al. 2001 for details). This is\nconsistent with the age difference predicted from our new HB models (see Fig.\n1), which provides a further support that the HB morphology is a reliable age\nindicator in most population II stellar systems.\n\nFigure 2.\nFiducial sequence for M3 is compared with that for M13\nfollowing the prescription of VandenBerg et al. (1990). Note a separation between the two clusters' RGBs, indicating an age difference.\n\nReferences\nChaboyer, B., Demarque, P., Kernan, P. J., & Krauss, L. M. 1998, ApJ, 494, 96\nGratton, R.
