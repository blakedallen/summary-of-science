We estimate the expansion velocity of\nthe superbubble as \u223c 20 km s\u22121 both perpendicular to and parallel to the Galactic disk with a consistent\ntimescale of \u223c 20 Myr.\nKey words: Galaxy: kinematics and dynamics - ISM: bubbles - ISM: H II regions - ISM: individual\n(NGC 281) - masers (H2 O)\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nA paradigm shift has been occurring in recent years in\nthe observational study of the interstellar medium (ISM)\nin the Galaxy and in external galaxies, where the ISM is\nnow recognized as being of fundamental importance not\nonly in the life cycle of stars but also in galactic evolution.\nThe present understanding of the ISM draws a dynamic\nand violent picture of the gas in the vast interstellar space,\nrather than a static one envisioned previously. Recent observations with higher angular resolution have revealed\nthe existence of dynamic and diverse gas structures in the\nGalaxy that cannot be explained by the traditional evolutionary cycle of the ISM, requiring new insights toward a\ncomprehensive understanding of the ISM (e.g., Reynolds\n1997, 2002; Dickey 2001). Extreme activity of the ISM is\nindicated by large-scale circular or arc-like structures (up\nto a few kiloparsecs in scale) called superbubbles or su-\n\npershells, many of which were identified earlier by Heiles\n(1979, 1984) based on H I 21-cm line surveys by Weaver\nand Williams (1973) and Heiles and Habing (1974). Kiss,\nMo\u00f3r, and T\u00f3th (2004) later identified 145 large-scale\nloop- or arc-like structures in the 2nd Galactic quadrant\n(i.e. for galactic longitudes 90\u25e6 < l < 180\u25e6) on IRAS-based\nfar-infrared maps. Recent results for the 1st, 3rd, and 4th\nGalactic quadrants by K\u00f6nyves et al. (2007) increased the\nnumber of identified loops to 462. Similar objects are also\nfound in nearby galaxies, including the Local Group spirals Andromeda (M31; Brinks & Bajaja 1986) and M33\n(Deul & den Hartog 1990), Local Group irregulars including the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC; Chu et al. 1993,\n1995; Kim et al. 1998, 1999), the Small Magellanic Cloud\n(SMC; Staveley-Smith et al. 1997; Stanimirovi\u0107 et al.\n1999) and IC 10 (Shostak & Skillman 1989), large spiral galaxies such as M101 (Kamphuis et al. 1991) and\nNGC 891 (Howk & Savage 1997, 2000), and dwarf galax-\n\n\f2\n\nM.

The red nebulosity of the H II region NGC 281 is obscured in its southwestern quadrant by the adjoining\nmolecular cloud NGC 281 West, where the H2 O maser source is located.\n\nies such as M82 (Matsushita et al. 2000; Matsumoto et al.\n2001), IC 2574, DDO 47 (Walter & Brinks 1999, 2001)\nand Holmberg II (HoII; Puche et al. 1992).\nThe most widely accepted theory for the origin of superbubbles suggests that supernova explosions and strong\nstellar winds from OB associations in a galactic disk blow\nthe surrounding gas up into the halo, carving out extensive cavities in the ISM (see Tenorio-Tagle & Bodenheimer\n1988). Superbubbles are therefore believed to play a vital\nrole in disk-halo interactions, serving as a conduit for matter and energy from the disk into the halo in the form of\ngalactic 'fountains' (Shapiro & Field 1976) or 'chimneys'\n(Norman & Ikeuchi 1989).\nIn the Galaxy, only a small number of chimneys (or also\ncalled 'worms') or fragmenting superbubbles/supershells\n(on several hundred to one thousand parsec scales) are\nknown and well-studied: e.g., the Orion-Eridanus superbubble (Cowie et al. 1979; Reynolds & Ogden 1979;\nBoumis et al. 2001; Welsh et al. 2005), the Cygnus\nsuperbubble (Cash et al. 1980), the Stockert chimney\n(M\u00fcller et al. 1987; Kundt & M\u00fcller 1987; Forbes 2000),\nthe Aquila supershell (Maciejewski et al. 1996), the\nScutum supershell (Callaway et al. 2000; Savage et al.\n2001), GSH 277+00+36 (McClure-Griffiths et al. 2000),\nGSH 242-03+37 (McClure-Griffiths et al. 2006), the W4\n\nchimney/superbubble (Normandeau et al. 1996; Reynolds\net al. 2001; Terebey et al. 2003; Madsen et al. 2006; West\net al. 2007), the Ophiuchus superbubble (Pidopryhora\net al. 2007), and the NGC 281 superbubble (Megeath et al.\n2002, 2003; Sato et al. 2007). Superbubbles are also a key\ntarget of research for understanding their impact on the\nhistory of star formation in the galactic disk, including\nbut not limited to superbubble-triggered star formation\n(e.g., NGC 281 as explained later in the section).\nIn either the Galaxy or external galaxies, very little is\nknown about the dynamics and energetics of superbubbles/chimneys or about their influence on the formation\nof the halo or on the star formation history in the galactic\ndisk. A difficulty in revealing the structure and kinematics of superbubbles stems from the limited information obtainable from two dimensions of sky positions and velocity\ninformation only along the line of sight. A direct observation of the three-dimensional (3D) motion and structure\nof a superbubble has not been easy due to the high astrometric accuracy required. However, Sato et al. (2007) reported the first VLBI (Very Long Baseline Interferometry)\nobservations that obtained direct evidence for expanding\nmotions of a superbubble by measuring the proper motions.\nIn Sato et al. (2007), we observed the H2 O maser emis-\n\n\fNo. ]\n\nDistance to NGC 281\n\nsion in NGC 281 West over 6 months with VERA (VLBI\nExploration of Radio Astrometry), a new Japanese radio\ntelescope array dedicated to phase-referencing VLBI astrometry (e.g., Honma et al. 2000, 2005, 2007; Kobayashi\net al. 2003; Imai et al. 2006, 2007; Hirota et al. 2007,\n2008a, 2008b; Nakagawa et al. 2008; Kim et al. 2008; Choi\net al. 2008). These observations revealed the systemic motion of the NGC 281 superbubble away from the Galactic\nplane at a velocity of 20\u221230 km s\u22121 . At its estimated\nheliocentric distance of 2.2\u22123.5 kpc, NGC 281 most likely\noriginated in the Galactic plane and has been blown out\nby a superbubble expansion (see \u00a71.1 and Sato et al. 2007).\nA precise and direct determination of the distance to\nNGC 281 is desirable and essential for a better understanding of the region, including further description of\nthe 3D structure and motion of the superbubble to reveal\nthe origin, the energetics and the timescale of the superbubble. These are the primary reasons why we decided\nto complete our VERA observations to directly measure\nthe parallactic distance to NGC 281 via an H2 O maser\nsource. The astrometric determination of the distance\nto NGC 281 is also important for studying early-type\n(O\u2212B) high-mass (M >\n\u223c 10M\u2299 ) stars and stellar evolution\nin combination and in comparison with photometric studies of the OB stars in NGC 281 (e.g., Henning et al. 1994;\nGuetter & Turner 1997). In this paper, we present the\nresults of our parallax measurements with VERA over 18\nmonths, which enables us to further discuss the 3D structure, expanding motion, the origin and the timescale of\nthe NGC 281 superbubble.\n1.1.\n\nNGC 281 Superbubble\n\nThe NGC 281 region (\u03b12000 =00h52m , \u03b42000 = +56\u25e6 34\u2032\nor l =123\u25e6.07, b = \u22126.\u25e631) provides an excellent laboratory\nfor studying in detail the cycle of the ISM and its impact\non both star formation and Galactic disk-halo interaction\nthrough superbubbles. At its estimated heliocentric distance of 3 kpc, this region is remarkably located far above\n(\u223c 300 pc) the midplane of the Perseus arm of the Galaxy.\nOf special interest in the NGC 281 region is a possibility of\ntriggered star formation occurring on two different scales:\nlarge-scale (\u223c300 pc) supperbubble-triggered formation of\nthe first OB stars (Megeath et al. 2002, 2003), and the sequential and ongoing triggered star formation (\u223c1\u221210 pc)\nin an adjoining giant molecular cloud (NGC 281 West)\nthrough interaction with an H II region (the NGC 281 nebula) excited by the first OB stars (Elmegreen & Lada 1978;\nMegeath & Wilson 1997).\nFigure 1 is an optical image of the region, which clearly\nshows the red nebulosity of the H II region NGC 281 (also\nknown as Sharpless 184) of diameter 20 arcmin (\u223c 17 pc),\nin which an early-type cluster called IC 1590 is embedded (Guetter & Turner 1997). The brightest member of\nthe cluster IC 1590 is an O-type Trapezium-like system\nHD 5005 (or also called ADS 719), whose component stars\nHD 5005ab (unresolved), HD 5005c, and HD 5005d have\nspectral types of O6.5 V, O8 V, and O9 V, respectively\n(Walborn 1973; Abt 1986; Guetter & Turner 1997).\nThe southwestern quadrant of the NGC 281 nebula is\n\n3\n\nobscured (as seen in figure 1) by the adjoining molecular\ncloud NGC 281 West in front of the nebula. Ongoing star\nformation in the NGC 281 West cloud is indicated by the\nH2 O maser emission and IRAS sources within this cloud\nnear the clumpy interface between the H II region and the\ncloud. This generation of stars may have been triggered\nby interactions with the H II region (Elmegreen & Lada\n1978; Megeath & Wilson 1997). The NGC 281 molecular cloud complex that surrounds the H II region (including the NGC 281 West and East clouds) was mapped\nin CO emission lines by Lee and Jung (2003). The central radial velocity of the NGC 281 West molecular cloud,\nVLSR = 31 km s\u22121 (Lee and Jung 2003), agrees well with\nthat of the H2 O maser emission in the cloud (Sato et al.\n2007). On a larger scale, Megeath et al. (2002, 2003) identified the CO molecular cloud complex as being on an H I\nloop extending over 300 pc away from the Galactic plane\ntoward decreasing galactic latitude. In an l vs. VLSR diagram (i.e. a plot of galactic longitude vs. observed radial\nvelocity), the CO molecular clouds appear to be part of\na broken ring of diameter 270 pc, expanding at a velocity of 22 km s\u22121 parallel to the Galactic plane (Megeath\net al. 2002, 2003). Megeath et al. (2002, 2003) suggested\nthat these clouds were formed in a fragmenting superbubble, which triggered the formation of the first OB stars,\nand that these OB stars then ionized the surrounding gas\nwhich subsequently triggered ongoing star formation in\nthe neighboring cloud.\nIn Sato et al. (2007), we derived the absolute proper\nmotions of the H2 O maser features in NGC 281 West by\nphase-referencing VLBI observations with VERA over 6\nmonths. We found 10 maser features, highly likely excited\nby two spatially distinct young stellar objects (YSOs),\nare systematically moving toward southwest, in agreement with the direction of the proper motion of HD 5005\nin the H II region measured with larger uncertainties by\nHipparcos (Perryman et al. 1995, 1997). Our results with\nVERA revealed the systemic motion of the NGC 281 region away from the Galactic plane, most likely having\noriginated in the Galactic plane and been blown out by\nthe expansion of the NGC 281 fragmenting superbubble.\nThe uncertainties in our velocity estimates are largely\ndue to the large distance uncertainty of NGC 281, despite\nmany measurements, e.g., photometric distances of 2 kpc\n(Sharpless 1952, 1954), 3.68 kpc (Cruz-Gonz\u00e1lez et al.\n1974), 3.5 kpc (Henning et al. 1994) and 2.94\u00b10.15 kpc\n(Guetter & Turner 1997) and kinematic distances of\n2.2 kpc (Georgelin & Georgelin 1976; Roger & Pedlar\n1981) and 3 kpc (Lee & Jung 2003). In Sato et al. (2007),\nwe adopted a value of 2.9 kpc as the distance to NGC 281,\nbased on a recent estimate of 2.94\u00b10.15 kpc derived by\nGuetter and Turner (1997) through photometry of 279\nindividual stars in and about the young cluster IC 1590\nembedded in the NGC 281 nebula.\nThe most reliable and direct way to determine the distance (d) of an astronomical object is to measure the\ntrigonometric parallax (\u03c0) of the object due to the Earth's\nmotion around the solar system barycenter, where the distance is given by d(pc) = 1/\u03c0(\u2032\u2032 ). The astrometric deter-\n\n\f4\n\nM. Sato et al.\n\nmination of the distance to NGC 281 provides valuable\ninformation for studying the formation and evolution of\nearly-type (O\u2212B) high-mass (M >\n\u223c 10M\u2299 ) stars in comparison with photometric studies and distances, for example, by Guetter & Turner (1997).\nIn the present study, we report on our successful determination of the parallactic distance to NGC 281, which\nreveals the 3D structure of the NGC 281 fragmenting superbubble, and investigate the origin and timescale of the\nformation of such a large-scale (\u223c650 pc) structure.\n2.\n\nVERA Observations and Data Reduction\n\nThe VERA observations were carried out over 13 epochs\nspaced approximately at monthly to bimonthly intervals.\nThe first 6 epochs reported in Sato et al. (2007) were on\n2006 May 14, July 21, August 3, September 5, October\n25, and November 18 (days of year 134, 202, 215, 248,\n298, and 322, respectively). Seven new observations were\nconducted on 2006 December 11, 2007 January 22, March\n19, May 1, July 27, September 30, and October 28 (days of\nyear 345, 387, 443, 486, 573, 638, 666 as counted from 2006\nJanuary 0). Note that the dates stated here are universal\ntime (UT) start times, while for the data analyses in the\nfollowing section we use more precisely the median hour\nof each observation, which lasted 7\u22129 hours.\nThe observational procedures are as described in Sato\net al. (2007) and as follows. We observed two sources simultaneously in the dual-beam mode of VERA for phase\nreferencing (e.g., Honma et al. 2003), and the real-time instrumental phase difference data between the two beams\nwere taken with an artificial noise source in each beam and\nrecorded for calibration (Kawaguchi et al. 2000; Honma\net al. 2008a). We simultaneously observed the H2 O\nmaser source in the NGC 281 West cloud with one of the\ntwo extragalactic position-reference quasars J0047+5657\n(0\u25e6 .84 separation; at \u03b12000 =00h47m 00.s 428805, \u03b42000 =\n+56\u25e6 57\u2032 42.\u2032\u2032 39479) and J0042+5708 (1\u25e6 .50 separation;\nat \u03b12000 =00h42m 19.s 451727, \u03b42000 = +57\u25e6 08\u2032 36.\u2032\u2032 58602).\nPositions are from Beasley et al. (2002). We alternated between the two quasars typically every 10 minutes. We observed a bright calibrator source hourly: J0319+4130 (=\n3C 84) at the first epoch (2006 May 14) and J2232+1143\n(= CTA 102) for the other 12 epochs. The data correlation\nwas performed with the Mitaka FX correlator (Chikada\net al. 1991) with frequency and velocity resolutions for\nthe maser lines of 15.625 kHz and 0.21 km s\u22121 , respectively. The observed frequencies of the maser lines were\nconverted to radial (line-of-sight) velocities with respect\nto the local standard of rest (LSR), VLSR , using a rest frequency of 22.235080 GHz for the H2 O 616 -523 transition.\nVisibility calibration and imaging were performed in\na standard manner with the NRAO Astronomical Image\nProcessing System (AIPS) package. The visibilities of all\nH2 O maser channels at each epoch were phase-referenced\nto each of the position-reference sources J0047+5657 and\nJ0042+5708 independently by applying the phase solutions from fringe fitting (AIPS taks FRING) for each\nposition-reference source to the H2 O maser channels for\n\n[Vol. ,\n\nthe corresponding observation time and frequencies. The\ninstrumental phase difference between the two beams was\nalso corrected using the recorded phase-calibration data\ndescribed above. We also calibrated the error in the visibility phase caused by the Earth's atmosphere based on\nGPS measurements of the atmospheric zenith delay due\nto tropospheric water vapor (Honma et al.2008b). After\ncalibration, we made spectral-line image cubes using the\nAIPS task IMAGR around the maser spots with 512 pixels \u00d7 512 pixels of size 0.05 mas. The synthesized beam\nhad an FWHM beam size of 1.3 mas \u00d7 0.8 mas with a position angle of \u221243\u25e6 East of North. Least-squares fittings\nwere performed to simultaneously solve for the sinusoidal\nparallax curve and linear proper motion in the directions\nof right ascension (RA) and declination (Dec).\n3.\n3.1.\n\nResults\nParallax Measurements\n\nFigure 2 shows the position measurements of the\nbrightest maser spot at VLSR = \u221232.1 km s\u22121 (feature\n#4 of 10 features identified in Sato et al. 2007) using\nJ0047+5657 (blue) and J0042+5708 (red) as positionreference sources independently. Figures 2a and 2b show\nthe positional offsets of the maser spot in the eastward\n(X, i.e. (RA) cos(Dec)) and northward (Y , i.e. Dec) directions, respectively, relative to the reference position at\nthe origin at \u03b12000 =00h52m 24.s 70081 for X and \u03b42000 =\n+56\u25e6 33\u2032 50.\u2032\u2032 5274 for Y , as a function of time (day of year,\nas counted from 2006 January 0). The constant offsets of\n\u223c 0.80 mas seen in each of X and Y between the two\nmeasurements using different position-reference sources\nJ0047+5657 and J0042+5708 are due to the uncertainties in the absolute positions of these reference sources\n(0.64 mas for J0047+5657 and 0.82 mas for J0042+5708;\nBeasley et al. 2002) and are solved for in the multi-epoch\nparallax and proper-motion fittings. The best-fit models\nare also plotted with gray lines for proper motions and\nblack curves for the sum of sinusoidal parallax and the\nlinear proper motions. Table 1 summarizes the fitted distances and proper motions. Figures 2c is a plot of the\nspot position in Y vs. X and its movement during the\nobservation epochs.\nThe obtained values of the parallax in X are: \u03c0 =\n0.346 \u00b1 0.052 mas (corresponding to a distance of d =\n2.89 \u00b1 0.43 kpc) using J0047+5657 and \u03c0 = 0.334 \u00b1\n0.047 mas (corresponding to a distance of d = 2.99 \u00b1\n0.42 kpc) using J0042+5708. Combining these independent measurements using two different position-reference\nsources, we have obtained as a final value in X (RA) direction: \u03c0 = 0.340 \u00b1 0.034 mas (d = 2.94 \u00b1 0.30 kpc).\nSimilarly, we have obtained the parallax in Y to be: \u03c0 =\n0.400 \u00b1 0.095 mas (d = 2.50 \u00b1 0.59 kpc) using J0047+5657\nand \u03c0 = 0.412 \u00b1 0.092 mas (d = 2.43 \u00b1 0.54 kpc) using\nJ0042+5708. Combining these two measurements yields\nthe final value in Y (Dec) direction to be: \u03c0 = 0.406 \u00b1\n0.065 mas (d = 2.46 \u00b1 0.39 kpc).

We will discuss the possible error\nsources in \u00a74.1 in more detail. However, those errors are\ndifficult to measure quantitatively, and we therefore estimated the astrometric errors by the standard deviations\nof the residuals from the fits and plotted the standard\ndeviations as the error bars of each point in figure 2.\nWeighting by \u03c3X and \u03c3Y , we simultaneously fitted the\nposition measurements of the maser spot in both X and\nY altogether, including all data using J0047+5657 and\nJ0042+5708, to obtain the final result for the parallax\nmeasurements to be: \u03c0 = 0.355 \u00b1 0.030 mas, which corresponds to a distance to NGC 281 of d = 2.82 \u00b1 0.24 kpc.\nWe have therefore successfully determined the parallactic distance to NGC 281 as far as \u223c 3 kpc with a precision better than 10%. Our distance estimate of NGC 281,\nd = 2.82 \u00b1 0.24 kpc, agrees well with the recent photometric distance of 2.94\u00b10.15 kpc by Guetter and Turner\n(1997), but excludes the kinematic distance of 2.2 kpc by\nGeorgelin and Georgelin (1976) and by Roger and Pedlar\n(1981) and most distance estimates in earlier studies.\n3.2.\n\nAbsolute Proper Motions\n\nAs listed in table 1, we fitted the position measurements of 13 epochs simultaneously for both the parallax\n\u03c0 and proper motions (\u03bcX , \u03bcY ) (in RA and Dec, respectively) of the peak maser spot of feature 4 (the brightest feature in the maser component C3, which is one of\nthe two spatial components C1 and C3 with maser emission detected in Sato et al. 2007). For the proper motions, we obtained (\u22122.60\u00b10.07 \u22121.97\u00b10.11) mas yr\u22121 using J0047+5657, and (\u22122.65\u00b10.07, \u22121.74\u00b10.11) mas yr\u22121\n\nusing J0042+5708. The error-weighted mean proper\nmotions of this spot (which are the same as unweighted mean in this case of equal errors) are:\n(\u03bcX , \u03bcY )=(\u22122.63\u00b10.05, \u22121.86\u00b10.08) mas yr\u22121 . We consider this mean as revised values (called 'modified' hereafter) of the error-weighted mean proper motions (denoted\nby 4w) of feature 4 reported in Sato et al. (2007).\nTable 2 shows a comparison of the absolute proper motions derived for feature 4 between the revised values in\nthe present study and the previous values in Sato et al.\n(2007). In Sato et al. (2007), we derived absolute proper\nmotions of feature 4 (in C3) and features 9 and 10 (in\nC1, the other one of the two spatial maser components;\nsee Sato et al. 2007) assuming the distance to NGC 281\nto be d = 2.9 kpc (adopting the photometric distance by\nGuetter and Turner 1997) and subtracting the expected\nparallax in the position measurements during the first 6\nobservation epochs.\nThe revised values of \u03bcX for feature 4 in the present\nstudy agree with the previous values in Sato et al. (2007)\nwithin the margin of errors (1\u03c3), however, for \u03bcY we find\ndeviations of the revised values from the previous ones\nlarger than the errors (> 2\u03c3) estimated in Sato et al.\n(2007). This means in Sato et al. (2007) we overestimated\n\u03bcY of feature 4 and underestimated the errors in the linear least-squares fittings (after subtracting the assumed\nparallax). As seen in figure 2 based on the present longertime observations, the overestimate of the previous \u03bcY\nvalues for feature 4 is due to a large position deviation\nfrom the best-fit at the first (+2\u03c3) epochs, which yielded\na larger slope. The underestimate of the errors occured\nmostly due to non-gaussian errors larger than 0.1 mas\n(larger than thermal errors by an order of magnitude)\nin the position measurements, owing to astrometric error\nsources that are discussed in more detail in \u00a74.1. However,\nas will be described in \u00a74.2, the scientific conclusions remain essentially unchanged after the modifications to the\nproper motions.\nBy adding the mean relative motion of all 8 fea-\n\n\fNo. ]\n\nDistance to NGC 281\n\n7\n\nTable 2.

(2007), to this modified absolute motion of feature 4, the mean absolute\nproper motion of these features in C3 (denoted by\nC3m in Sato et al. 2007) is then also revised to be:\n(\u03bc \u0304X , \u03bc \u0304Y )C3 =(\u22122.17\u00b10.33, \u22121.44\u00b10.32) mas yr\u22121 .\nOur new distance estimate of NGC 281 by parallax\nmeasurements, d = 2.82 kpc, also introduces a slight\nmodification to the measured absolute proper motions\nof features 9 and 10 on the same data of 6 epochs\n(as these features were not persistent through the total 13-epoch observations with high enough signal-tonoise ratios for the parallax and proper motion fittings). The modified absolute proper motions (\u03bcX , \u03bcY )\nof feature 9 are (\u22124.85\u00b10.11, \u22121.73\u00b10.46) mas yr\u22121\nusing J0047+5657, and (\u22124.74\u00b10.28, \u22121.44\u00b10.41)\nmas yr\u22121 using J0042+5708. Similarly we obtained\nthe absolute proper motion (\u03bcX , \u03bcY ) of feature 10\nto be: (\u22122.00\u00b10.23, \u22124.06\u00b10.79) mas yr\u22121 using\nJ0047+5657, and (\u22121.89\u00b10.38, \u22124.14\u00b10.69) mas yr\u22121 using J0042+5708. Here the associated uncertainties in \u03bcX\nand \u03bcY were estimated from the standard deviations from\nthe linear least-squares fits in X and Y positional offsets\n(after the parallax for d = 2.82 kpc is subtracted), respectively. The error-weighted mean proper motions of each of\nthese features in C1 (denoted by 9w and 10w in Sato et al.\n2007) are (\u03bcX , \u03bcY )=(\u22124.84\u00b10.10, \u22121.57\u00b10.31) mas yr\u22121\nfor feature 9 and (\u03bcX , \u03bcY )=(\u22121.97\u00b10.20, \u22124.11\u00b10.52)\nmas yr\u22121 for feature 10. Then the unweighted mean of\nthe absolute motions of these two features in C1 (denoted\nby C1m in Sato et al. 2007) is also slightly modified to be\n(\u03bc \u0304X , \u03bc \u0304Y )C1 =(\u22123.41, \u22122.84) mas yr\u22121 .\n4.\n4.1.\n\nDiscussion\nAstrometric Error Sources\n\nIn the present work, we measured the annual parallax of\nNGC 281 West to be 0.355\u00b10.030 mas, which corresponds\nto a distance of 2.82 \u00b1 0.24 kpc. In this section, we first\ndiscuss possible error sources in our parallax and propermotion measurements.\nAs already mentioned in \u00a73.1, the true uncertainties in\nthe measurements were estimated from standard deviations of the post-fit residual from the least-squares fits\n(as listed in table 1), because thermal errors due to noise\n\nin individual position measurements (\u223c 0.010 mas) are\nfar smaller than the deviations from the fits. The likely\nsources for such deviations are difficult to measure quantitatively, which led to our error underestimate in the derived absolute proper motions of feature 4 in Sato et al.\n(2007) as described in \u00a73.2. The reference sources did\nnot show any resolved structure such as additional components or structural change, and we obtained similar results. Therefore we do not consider the contribution of\nthe reference source as a dominant error source.\nOne of the likely causes for position uncertainties of\n\u03c3X = 0.104 \u2212 0.113 mas and \u03c3Y = 0.181 \u2212 0.188 mas (see\ntable 1) is mis-modeling of tropospheric zenith delay, as\nalso reported in previous astrometric measurements with\nVERA (e.g., Hirota et al. 2007; Nakagawa et al. 2008;\nHonma et al. 2008b). The water vapor in the troposphere introduces optical path differences through the atmosphere between the target maser source and reference\nsources because of the elevation angle difference between\nthe sources. Therefore, even after the phase referencing\ncalibration, there remain residuals of tropospheric zenith\ndelay due to the water vapor, which are difficult to measure precisely and are one of the most serious error sources\nin the VLBI astrometry in the 22-GHz band. Nakagawa\net al. (2008) and Honma, Tamura & Reid (2008b) give\ndetailed discussion on astrometric errors caused by such\nresiduals of tropospheric zenith delay calibration with\nVERA and report probable errors, \u03c3X and \u03c3Y , of 0.05mas and 0.10-mas levels, respectively, for source declination of 60\u25e6 . Our parallax determination with VERA is\nno exception in having astrometric errors larger in declination (Y ) than in right ascension (X) (i.e. \u03c3Y > \u03c3X ) as\nthe same tendencies reported in other observations with\nVERA (e.g., Hirota et al. 2007). Larger errors in Y (Dec)\nthan in X (RA) are explained by the tendency of tropospheric zenith delay errors to have more severe effects\nin the Y direction (although depending of the separation\nangle between the target and reference sources and the\ndeclination of the sources) and are as expected by the\nsimulation in Honma, Tamura and Reid (2008b).\nHowever, we do not consider the residuals of tropospheric zenith delay as the dominant cause of errors in our\nparallax measurements. As the simulations by Honma,\nTamura and Reid (2008b) clearly show, the astrometric\nerrors due to the zenith delay residuals for the NGC 281\ncase at its high declination (\u03b42000 \u2243 +56\u25e6 .5) and with\n\n\f8\n\nM. Sato et al.\n\nseparation angle (SA) smaller than 1\u25e6 for J0047+5206\n(SA=0\u25e6 .84) are expected to be as good as 20 \u2212 30 \u03bcas\n(i.e. 0.020 \u2212 0.030 mas) in each of X and Y directions,\nwhich do not account for all the standard deviations\n\u03c3X = 0.104 \u2212 0.113 mas and \u03c3Y = 0.181 \u2212 0.188 mas in\nour measurements. Also, as figure 2 clearly demonstrates,\nusing two different reference quasars with different separation angles (SA=0\u25e6 .84 for J0047+5206 and SA=1\u25e6 .50\nfor J0042+5708) did not result in remarkable differences\nin the astrometric errors for the two cases. This certainly\nexcludes the simple zenith delay error effect as the main\nsource of our astrometric errors.\nThe most likely major source of errors in the present position measurements is a variation of the intrinsic maser\nstructure. Most maser spots are unresolved in VLBI observations, however evidence has been shown for intrinsic\nmaser structure smaller than 1 AU on submilliarcsecond\nscales in previous maser studies (e.g., Fish & Sjouwerman\n2007). A maser spot likely consists of both unresolved\nsubstructure and observed larger structure which are indistinguishable (e.g., Fish & Sjouwerman 2007), and thus\na variation in maser substructure can lead to fluctuation of\nthe peak position, limiting the accuracy in position measurements of a maser spot. This effect of the maser spatial\nstructure is also seen for other observations in parallax\nmeasurements with up to 10% errors, independently of\nthe source distance, for example, in Orion KL by Hirota\net al. (2007). Errors due to the maser structure can be\nreduced by using multiple maser features for derivation of\na parallax. In our case of NGC 281 West, however, only\none bright maser feature (above 10 Jy beam\u22121 ) that was\nused in the present study was found with a good signalto-noise ratio for the precise parallax measurements, even\npersistent for the all observation epochs.\nAccording to discussions by Honma et al. (2007), other\npossible astrometric errors in VERA observations that\narise from the uncertainties in the antenna-station positions, delay models, and path length differences due to\nionosphere are smaller by at least an order of magnitude\nthan the uncertainties due to tropospheric zenith delay\nresiduals. Therefore, we conclude that the main error\nsources of our astrometric measurements is the variability of maser feature structure, and the contribution by\ntropospheric zenith delay residuals is also nonnegligible.\n4.2.\n\nNGC 281 Superbubble vs. Galactic Rotation\n\nUsing our new results from parallax and proper-motion\nmeasurements of the H2 O maser source in NGC 281 West,\nwe now revise the motion of the NGC 281 region with\nrespect to the Galactic rotation as reported in Sato et al.\n(2007).\nIn an analogous manner to Sato et al. (2007), we show\nthe modified systemic motion of the NGC 281 region away\nfrom the Galactic plane, traced by our H2 O maser observations, as a red arrow in figure 3a, relative to a frame\nrotating with the Galactic rotation. Figures 3a, b and c\nare an image of the NGC 281 superbubble plotted as b\nvs. l (velocity-integrated for the Perseus-arm line-of-sight\nvelocity range, VLSR = \u221260 to \u221225 km s\u22121 ) and VLSR vs.\n\n[Vol. ,\n\nl (latitude-integrated for the galactic latitude range indicated by a cyan rectangle in figure 3a) diagrams after\nMegeath et al. (2003) and based on H I 21-cm line data\nby Hartmann and Burton (1973) and 12 CO(J = 1 \u2212 0) line\ndata by Dame, Hartmann, and Thaddeus (2001). At the\nposition of NGC 281 West, the Galactic plane lies almost\nparallel to the east-west (RA) direction with a position angle of 90.\u25e6 2, so that we can regard the motions in X (RA)\nand Y (Dec) directions as those parallel (l) and perpendicular (b; with only small projection effect at b = \u22126.\u25e6 31)\nto the Galactic plane, respectively.\nSubtracting the expected apparent motions of NGC 281\ndue to the (simulated) Galactic rotation (with respect to the LSR) and the solar motion effect,\n(\u03bcGX , \u03bcGY )=(\u22123.27, \u22120.29) mas yr\u22121 (including the apparent motion arising from the nonzero galactic latitude\nof NGC 281; b = \u22126.\u25e6 31) and (\u03bcSX , \u03bcSY )=(0.84, \u22120.53)\nmas yr\u22121 , respectively, from the measured mean proper\nmotion of the H2 O maser source in NGC 281 West yields\nthe systemic motion of the region with respect to the rotation of the Galaxy. Here we have adopted our new\ndistance estimate of NGC 281, 2.82 kpc, and the solar motion relative to the LSR based on Hipparcos data\n(Dehnen & Binney 1998), and also assumed the distance\nfrom the Sun to the Galactic center, R0 , to be 8.0 kpc\n(Reid 1993), the rotational velocity of the Galaxy at the\nLocal Standard of Rest (LSR, at R0 ), \u03980 , to be 236 km s\u22121\n(Reid & Brunthaler 2004), and a flat rotation curve of\nthe Galaxy (i.e. a differential rotation with a nearly constant rotational velocity \u0398 \u2248 \u03980 for the outer Galaxy).\nSubtracting these two effects of the Galactic rotation and\nthe solar motion on the apparent motion of NGC 281\nfrom the observed proper motions, we obtain the modified mean absolute proper motions of the maser features in C3 and C1 with respect to the Galactic rotation to be: (\u03bcX , \u03bcY )C3\u2212GR =(0.26, \u22120.62) mas yr\u22121 and\n(\u03bcX , \u03bcY )C1\u2212GR =(\u22120.98, \u22122.02) mas yr\u22121 , respectively.\nThe mean of these two spatial components is expected to\ntrace the systemic motion of the NGC 281 region and obtained to be: (\u03bcX , \u03bcY )sys\u2212GR =(\u22120.36, \u22121.32) mas yr\u22121\nThe direction of this systemic motion with respect to a\nframe rotating with the Galactic rotation is shown as\na red arrow in figure 3a. At a distance of 2.82 kpc,\na proper motion of 1 mas yr\u22121 corresponds to a transverse velocity of 13.4 km s\u22121 , and therefore our velocity estimate for the systemic motion of NGC 281 is:\n(vl , vb )=(\u22124.8, \u221217.7)\u2243(\u22125, \u221218) km s\u22121 in the directions toward increasing l and b, respectively (the minus\nsigns here thus indicate the motions toward decreasing l\nand b).\nAs mentioned in Sato et al. (2007), if we adopt\nthe IAU standard values for the Galactic rotation of\nR0 =8.5 kpc and \u03980 =220 km s\u22121 (Kerr & LyndenBell 1986) instead of R0 =8.0 kpc and \u03980 =236 km s\u22121 ,\nand for the solar motion relative to the LSR of\nthe velocity V =19.5 km s\u22121 toward \u03b12000 =271.\u25e60,\n\u03b42000 =29.\u25e60, then the resulting values vary by up to\n\u223c10% in the b direction: (\u03bc\u2032GX , \u03bc\u2032GY )=(\u22122.92 \u22120.25)\nmas yr\u22121 , (\u03bc\u2032SX , \u03bc\u2032SY )=(1.25, \u22120.61) mas yr\u22121 and\n\n\fNo. ]\n\nDistance to NGC 281\n\n9\n\nFig. 3. The NGC 281 superbubble on the reproduced diagrams originally by Megeath et al. (2003) (inverse grayscale H I data from\nHartmann & Burton 1973; white contour 12 CO data from Dame, Hartmann, & Thaddeus 2001). The positions of NGC 281 (red)\nand IRAS 00420+5530 (green) are indicated. (a) The b vs. l map of the region, velocity-integrated for the Perseus-arm line-of-sight\nvelocity range of VLSR = \u221260 to \u221225 km s\u22121 . The measured systemic motion of NGC 281 relative to the rotating Galactic disk\nis plotted as a red arrow. (b) (c) The VLSR vs. l diagram, latitude-integrated for the galactic latitude range indicated by a cyan\nrectangle in (a). Two possible rings of clouds with their centers are indicated in cyan and pink (see text).\n\n(\u03bc\u2032X , \u03bc\u2032Y )sys\u2212GR =(\u22121.12, \u22121.28) mas yr\u22121 , yielding a systemic velocity estimate of (vl\u2032 , vb\u2032 )\u2243(\u221215, \u221217) km s\u22121 .\nIn the l direction, we did not discuss in Sato et al.\n(2007) the velocity component vl parallel to the Galactic\nplane due to its larger dependence of this direction on\nthe Galactic rotation model as can be seen in the two\ncases above. The velocity component vl toward decreasing\ngalactic longitude obtained above differs from what one\nwould expect from a simple expansion of the NGC 281\nsuperbubble if the origin (e.g., supernova explosions) of\nthe superbubble, expected to be around l \u2243 121\u25e6 from\nthe ring center in the VLSR vs. l diagram of figures 3b\nand 3c (see next section), was rotating with the Galaxy.\nThe Galactic rotation velocity that would yield vl \u2265 0 (toward increasing galactic longitude) is \u0398 \u2265 262 km s\u22121 for\nR0 = 8.0 kpc; thus the negative velocity component vl\ncould be explained by a faster rotational velocity of the\nGalaxy. However, it is likely that this motion vl of the\nregion relative to the Galactic rotation is real, reflecting\n\nthe motion of the superbubble as a whole in a large-scale\nphenomenon such as velocity jumps over a spiral shock in\nthe Perseus arm of the Galaxy (e.g., Xu et al. 2006; see\n\u00a74.3).\nIn the b direction, we find the NGC 281 region at a distance of z \u2243 311 pc (at d = 2.82 kpc) from the Galactic\nplane and moving away from the Galactic plane with a velocity component of \u223c 18 km s\u22121 . Assuming the origin of\nthe NGC 281 superbubble to lie within the Galactic plane\n(at b = 0\u25e6 ), the dynamical timescale of the superbubble estimated from a simple ballistic motion of vb is: tb = z/vb =\nb/\u03bcY \u2212GR = (\u22126.\u25e6 31)/(\u22121.36) mas yr\u22121 = 16.7 \u2243 17 Myr,\nwhere \u03bcY \u2212GR is the derived Y motion of the maser source\nin NGC 281 West relative to the Galactic rotation. This\ntimescale, 17 Myr, is consistent with our timescale estimate of the superbubble expansion in the direction (almost) parallel to the Galactic plane to be discussed in the\nnext section.\nHere we also simply estimate the kinetic energy of the\n\n\f10\n\nM. Sato et al.\n\nNGC 281 region in the direction perpendicular to the\nGalactic plane, and in the next section we will estimate\nthe expansion velocity, timescale, and energy parallel to\nthe plane as well. According to the mass estimates by\nMegeath et al. (2002) of the clouds in the region (indicated\nby a cyan rectangle in figure 3a), the velocity-integrated\nmass in atomic and molecular gas are 3.5 \u00d7 105 M\u2299 and\n105 M\u2299 , respectively. Megeath et al. (2002) estimated\nthe total kinetic energy of 4.5 \u00d7 1051 ergs for the ring\nof clouds indicated by a cyan (dashed) ellipse in the\n(l, VLSR ) diagram of figure 3b, expanding at a velocity of\nvring =22 km s\u22121 . Using the same mass estimate as given\nby Megeath et al. (2002) and our new estimate of the velocity component vb \u223c 18 km s\u22121 away from the Galactic\nplane, we estimate the region to also have kinetic energy\nof 3.0 \u00d7 1051 ergs in the direction perpendicular to the\nplane, which requires the energy of multiple supernovae.\n4.3.\n\nNGC 281 Superbubble: 3D Structure and Expansion\n\nOur determination of the parallactic distance to\nNGC 281 enables us to discuss the 3D structure and expansion of the NGC 281 superbubble.\nIn the NGC 281 superbubble, there exists another H2 O\nmaser souce in the star-forming region IRAS 00420+5530\n(\u03b12000 =00h 45m, \u03b42000 = +55\u25e6 47\u2032 or l =122\u25e6 .01, b =\n\u22127.\u25e6 07), whose position is indicated by green dots in figure 3. Moellenbrock, Claussen, and Goss (2007) measured the parallactic distance of the H2 O maser source\nin IRAS 00420+5530 with the Very Long Baseline Array\n(VLBA) to be d = 2.17 \u00b1 0.05 kpc. Combining the two\nparallax results, one can examine the size, structure and\nthe expansion of the superbubble three-dimensionally.\nFigures 4 illustrates the 3D positions of the two sources,\nNGC 281 and IRAS 00420+5530, in (a) edge-on (as a cross\nsection at a galactic longitude l \u223c 123\u25e6) and (b) face-on (as\nseen from the north Galactic pole) views of the Galaxy.\nAs mentioned previously, Megeath et al. (2002, 2003)\nfound an expanding ring of molecular clouds (called\n'Megeath's ring' hereafter), and estimated from \u2206l (i.e.\nthe ring size in galactic longitudes l) to be 270 pc. From\n\u2206VLSR (i.e. the ring 'size' in line-of-sight velocities VLSR )\nof vring1 \u224322 km s\u22121 and from \u2206l/\u2206VLSR the dynamical\nage is \u223c 6 Myr. However, since the heliocentric distances\nto NGC 281 and IRAS 00420+5530 are now determined\nby the parallax measurements to be 2.82 kpc and 2.17 kpc,\nrespectively, these clouds (shown as red and green points\nin figure 3) are separated from each by 650 pc (\u00b1290 pc)\nalong the line of sight. This then implies the major axis\nof Megeath's ring is along the line of sight and a size of\napproximately 700 \u2212 1900 pc in diameter (as derived geometrically from figure 3b; the radius of Megeath's ring can\nbe approximated by the distance between NGC 281 and\nIRAS 00420+5530). However, it remains unclear whether\nsuch an elongated shape of the molecular ring is plausible, compared to the apparent ring size of \u223c 300 pc (in\npart of the NGC 281 superbubble with apparent size of\n300 \u2212 500 pc) as seen in the (l, b) plane (figure 3a).\nWe thus suggest a smaller ring of clouds indicated by\na pink (dashed) ellipse (called 'our ring' hereafter) in fig-\n\n[Vol. ,\n\n\u22121\nfrom\nure 3c, excluding a cloud at VLSR <\n\u223c \u221210 km s\nMegeath's ring, as another possible interpretation of the\n(l, VLSR ) diagram. In this interpretation, NGC 281 and\nIRAS 00420+5530 are close to the far side and near side\nof the expanding ring, yielding a smaller ring diameter of\n\u223c 650 pc along the line of sight, a lower (\u223c70%) expansion velocity of the ring, vring2 \u2243 15 km s\u22121 , and thus a\nlower (\u223c50%) kinetic energy of 2.1 \u00d7 1051 ergs than for\nMegeath's ring. The sum of this kinetic energy of the ring\nexpansion (almost) parallel to the Galactic plane and the\nkinetic energy perpendicular to the plane (estimated to\nbe 3.0 \u00d7 1051 ergs in the previous section) yields total kinetic energy of 5.1 \u00d7 1051 ergs, again requiring multiple\nsupernovae. We also estimate the timescale of the ring\nexpansion parallel to the plane, tring2 \u2243 325 pc/vring2 \u2243\n21 Myr, which is in good agreement with the timescale\ntb \u2243 17 Myr independently estimated in the previous section from the velocity component vb perpendicular to the\nGalactic plane.\nNote that in either interpretation of these two rings,\nthe center of the ring (denoted by \u2217 in figures 3b and\n3c) is at the same galactic longitude, l \u2243 121\u25e6 (as indicated by yellow dotted lines in figure 3). Considering the\nring center as the origin of the superbubble, we can compare the (observed) line-of-sight velocities of the origin\n(i.e. the ring center in figures 3b and 3c), NGC 281 and\nIRAS 00420+5530 with those expected from the Galactic\nrotation model, expressed by\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0398 \u03980\nVLSR = R0 sin l cosb\n+ Vz sin b,\n(1)\n\u2212\nR R0\n\nwhere R and \u0398 are the galactocentric distance and rotational velocity of the Galaxy at the source position (l, b)\nin the galactic coordinates, and those for the LSR are R0\nand \u03980 . Here we also included Vz , the source velocity\ncomponent perpendicular to the Galactic plane (toward\nthe north Galactic pole), in order to take into account the\nprojection effects on the line-of-sight velocities for sources\nat non-zero galactic latitudes. However, we neglect this\nprojection-effect term because sin b \u2243 \u22120.1 for NGC 281\nand IRAS 00420+5530 and also because our measurement\ngives Vz \u2243 vb \u2243 \u221218 km s\u22121 of NGC 281 smaller than the\ngalactic rotation (\u0398 and \u03980 ) by an order of magnitude.\nUsing the heliocentric distance to the source, d, its projection onto the Galactic plane, D\u2032 = d cos b, and the cosine\nformula, R is expressed by\nq\nR = D\u20322 + R02 \u2212 2D\u2032 R0 cos l\n(2)\nq\n(3)\n= d2 cos2 b + R02 \u2212 2R0 d cos l cosb.\nAgain we adopt \u0398 \u2243 \u03980 \u2243 236 km s\u22121 , R0 \u2243 8.0 kpc,\nand then the line-of-sight velocities expected from the\n\u2032\nGalactic rotation model are: VN281\n= \u221236 km s\u22121 for\n\u2032\n\u22121\nNGC 281, VI00420 = \u221228 km s for IRAS 00420+5530,\n\u2032\nand Vring1\n= \u221236 km s\u22121 for Megeath's ring center (expected to be at the same heliocentric distance d = 2.82 kpc\n\u2032\nas NGC 281 from figure 3b), and Vring2\n= \u221233 km s\u22121\nfor our ring center, assumed to be at d = 2.5 kpc.\n\n\fNo. ]\n\nDistance to NGC 281\n\n11\n\nFig. 4. Schematic diagram of 3D structure and motion of the NGC 281 superbubble: (a) edge-on view (at a galactic longitude of\nl \u223c 123\u25e6 ) and (b) face-on view of the Galactic disk. Note that all motion vectors are as seen from the rotating Galactic disk (i.e.\nthe Galactic rotation is subtracted). The expected motions are plotted as arrows for the explosion origin (blue dotted; assumed to\nbe in the disk), expansion of the superbubble (green dashed) and for the observed motion of NGC 281 (red full). Errors are also\nindicated for our distance estimate of NGC 281 (see text).\n\nThe observed line-of-sight velocities are: VLSR,N281 =\n\u221231 km s\u22121 for NGC 281 (in 12 CO lines; Lee & Jung\n2003), which is redshifted from the model by \u2206VLSR,N281 \u2243\n+5 km s\u22121 , and for IRAS 00420+5530, on the other\nhand, VLSR,I00420 = \u221251 km s\u22121 (in C34 S(3\u22122) and other\nlines; Brand et al. 2001), which is blueshifted from the\nmodel by \u2206VLSR,I00420 \u2243 \u221223 km s\u22121 . This large blueshift\nof IRAS 00420+5530 is likely due to the expansion of\nthe molecular ring in the superbubble. The redshift of\nNGC 281 is capable of two different interpretations using\nthe Megeath's ring model and ours.\nFor Megeath's ring, the line-of-sight velocity of the ring\ncenter (in figure 3b), VLSR,ring1 = \u221230 km s\u22121 , is also redshifted from the model by \u2206VLSR,ring1 = +6 km s\u22121 , suggesting that not only NGC 281 but also the molecular ring\nas a whole has a redshifted line-of-sight velocity component relative to the Galactic rotation. Then the ring expansion velocity is vring1 \u2243 |\u2206VLSR,I00420 \u2212 \u2206VLSR,ring1 | \u2243\n29 km s\u22121 .\n\nFor our ring, on the other hand, the line-of-sight velocity\nof the ring center (in figure 3c), VLSR,ring2 = \u221236 km s\u22121 ,\nis blueshifted from the model velocity by \u2206VLSR,ring2 \u2243\n\u22123 km s\u22121 , indicating the redshift of NGC 281 is due\nto the ring expansion. Then the ring expansion velocity\nis obtained to be vring2 \u2243 |\u2206VLSR,I00420 \u2212 \u2206VLSR,ring2 | =\n20 km s\u22121 , and the timescale of expansion is roughly:\ntring2 \u2243 325 pc/vring2 \u2243 16 Myr, in good agreement with\nour independent timescale estimates above for ring expansion along the Galactic disk (tring2 \u223c 21 Myr) and for\nvertical expansion out of the disk (tb \u223c 17 Myr).\nAs mentioned in the previous section, the superbubble\nas a whole seems to have small systemic velocity deviations (\u223c 10 km s\u22121 ) from the Galactic rotation, not only\nalong the line of sight (toward blueshift) but also in the direction toward decreasing galactic longitude. This motion\nrelative to the Galactic rotation model is plotted as blue\ndotted arrows in figures 4a and 4b with expected expanding motion as green dashed arrows and the resulting ob-\n\n\f12\n\nM. Sato et al.\n\nserved velocity of NGC 281 as red arrows. The deviation\nof the superbubble motion from the Galactic rotation, in\nparticular the motion toward decreasing galactic longitude\n(against the expected expanding motion toward increasing longitude), might be reflecting the peculiar motion of\nthe Perseus spiral arm, which may be explained by velocity jumps over a spiral shock in the Perseus arm. Peculiar\nmotion in the Perseus arm is also reported by Xu et al.\n(2006) for the massive star-forming region W3(OH) (the\nposition indicated in figure 4b) to be rotating slower than\nthe Galactic rotation by \u2243 14 km s\u22121 . For the NGC 281\nsuperbubble, this lends support to the likely peculiar motion of the whole superbubble inward the Galactic rotation\nand toward the Sun.\nAlso in figure 4b, we have plotted star-forming regions\nin the solar neighborhood and in the Perseus arm of the\nGalaxy with recent parallactic distances precisely measured with VERA and the VLBA: Orion KL (Hirota et al.\n2007; Menten et al. 2007; Kim et al. 2008), NGC 1333\n(Hirota et al. 2008), IRAS 16293-2422 in \u03c1 Oph East (Imai\net al. 2007) and W3(OH) (Xu et al. 2006; Hachisuka et al.\n2006), demonstrating the high capability of the VLBI\ntechniques to reliably trace out the spiral arms of the\nGalaxy. Our parallactic distance to NGC 281 is likely\nto trace the far side of the Perseus arm, and we expect\nto reveal the detailed structure and motion of the Perseus\narm with future parallax measurements with VERA.\nThe parallactic distances to NGC 281 and\nIRAS 00420+5530 revealed the size of the superbubble to be above \u223c 650 pc in diameter along the line\nof sight, almost parallel to the Galactic plane. Compared\nto the superbubble size z perpendicular to the Galactic\nplane, z \u223c 300 \u2212 400 pc, the superbubble has a structure\nlikely elongated along the plane, or at least spherical (i.e.\nby taking the lower limit of 360 pc in size along the line\nof sight) and not elongated vertically in the z direction.\nThis is contrary to expectation, i.e. one would expect a\nsuperbubble to expand and blowout in the z direction\nwith a vertical density gradient and with a long timescale\nof \u223c 20 Myr (see e.g., Tomisaka & Ikeuchi 1986 and\nMac Low et al. 1989 for superbubble models with vertical\ndensity stratifaction).\nIt is thus indicated that the expansion of the NGC 281\nsuperbubble is confined to the Galactic disk. This may be\nexplained by Tomisaka (1998)'s 3-dimensional MHD simulations which show that the superbubble expansion can\nbe confined to the disk by the magnetic field of the disk,\nand our estimated 3D structure of the NGC 281 superbubble shows a very analogous shape, size and timescale\nto those of model A (size Rz \u223c 255 pc perpendicular to\nthe plane, timescale t \u223c 22Myr) of Tomisaka (1998), which\nassumes a uniform density of the ISM, n = 0.3 cm\u22123 and\na uniform magnetic field, B(z) = B(0) = 5\u03bcG, aligned to\none direction within and along the disk. Therefore, the\nshape of the NGC 281 superbubble sugessts that the superbubble expansion may be confined to the disk due to\nthe magnetic field of the disk.\nWithin the disk, the Tomisaka (1998) model predicts\nthe elongation of the superbubble to be along the direc-\n\n[Vol. ,\n\ntion of the magnetic field of the disk, which could be in\ndisagreement with the NGC 281 case if the magnetic field\nlies along the Perseus spiral arm (e.g., Han et al. 2006).\nThe density decrease of the Perseus spiral arm might be\nalso responsible for the structure formation at the position\nand heliocentric distance of NGC 281, thus yielding a possible implication on the width of the Perseus spiral arm.\nThe further details of the 3D structure of the NGC 281\nsuperbubble and its relation to the Perseus arm should be\nrevealed by future parallax measurements with VERA of\nmultiple maser sources in the superbubble.\n4.4.\n\nDistance to NGC 281 and the H-R Diagram\n\nOur astrometric determination of the distance to\nNGC 281 also provides important information toward better understanding of early-type (O\u2212B) high-mass (M >\n\u223c\n10M\u2299 ) stars and stellar evolution in combination with\nphotometric studies of the OB stars in NGC 281 (e.g.,\nHenning et al. 1994; Guetter & Turner 1997).\nIn the 1990s, the Hipparcos astrometry satellite measured the trigonometric parallaxes of more than 100 000\nstars in the solar neighborhood with a precision of about\n1 mas, including direct distance estimates of 20 853 stars\nwith a precision better than 10 percent and of 49 399\nstars (in total) with a precision better than 20 percent (Perryman et al. 1995, 1997). Figure 5 is the HR (Hertzsprung-Russell) diagram or the color-absolute\nmagnitude diagram based on the Hipparcos data of stars\n(shown as black dots) with parallactic distances determined with precisions better than 10%.\nThe achievements of Hipparcos marked a significant\nmilestone in the history of astronomy and brought a new\nera of astrometry, since before Hipparcos, parallax measurements were limited to the nearest stars and thus direct distance estimates of only several hundred nearby\nstars were known with precisions better than 20 percent.\nNevertheless, the parallax measurements by Hipparcos\nwere restricted only to within a few hundred parsecs from\nthe Sun, which is much smaller than the size of the Galaxy\n(e.g., \u223c15 kpc in disk radius).\nDue to the low local space density of OB stars, there is\na lack of early-type high-mass stars with absolute magnitudes reliably derived from astrometrically measured distances, as seen on the left side (i.e. the high-mass end)\nof figure 5. Alternatively, most of the distances and thus\nabsolute magnitudes of OB stars are estimated by a comparison of photometric colors and magnitudes with an\nempirical standard of zero-age main sequence (ZAMS)\nstars in the color-magnitude diagram, derived from other\nwell-studied objects such as Hyades (see Anthony-Twarog\n1982). Such ZAMS comparisons assume compositional\ndifferences in clusters can be ignored, however, the metalicity dependence of ZAMS stars is important when used as\ndistance scale and is the cause of difficulty in a direct comparison between theoretical models and empirical ZAMS\ncurves (e.g., Anthony-Twarog 1982; Zinnecker & Yorke\n2007). Therefore, precise and direct determination of distances, and thus absolute magnitudes, are desired and essential for further studies of stellar evolution sensitivity to\n\n\fNo. ]\n\nDistance to NGC 281\n\n13\n\nFig. 5.

Black dots show the Hipparcos data (Perryman et al. 1997), and red dots show the photometric data of ZAMS\nof early-type stars in NGC 281 by Guetter & Turner (1997), plotted with absolute magnitudes derived with our new parallactic\ndistance to NGC 281 of 2.82 kpc. Empirical ZAMS curves are also plotted: Turner (1976) in blue; Blaauw (1963) in pink; and\nSchmidt-Kaler (1982) in green (dashed). Orange dotted (lower) and dashed (upper) curves show ZAMS curves that would yield\ndistances of NGC 281 to be 2.2 kpc and 3.5 kpc (see text). (b) Magnified view of the boxed area (i.e. the high-mass end) in (a).\n\nmetalicity.\nAs mentioned earlier, extremely high astrometric accuracy can now be achieved with VLBI techniques out to as\nkiloparsec distances with precisions better than 10 percent\n(e.g., Xu et al. 2006; Hachisuka et al. 2006; Menten et al.\n2007). In particular, recent results of parallax measurements with VERA are reported in Hirota et al. (2007,\n2008a, 2008b), Honma et al. (2007), Nakagawa et al.\n(2008), Kim et al. (2008), and Choi et al. (2008), clearly\ndemonstrating VERA's high capability for the Galaxyscale astrometry.\nUsing our new distance determination of NGC 281 by\nparallax measurements with VERA, d = 2.82 \u00b1 0.24 kpc,\nto derive absolute magnitudes, we have plotted the photometric data of ZAMS of early-type stars in NGC 281\nby Guetter & Turner (1997) in figure 5 as red dots, which\ngive improved coverage of the high-mass end of the HR diagram. In figure 5, the empirical ZAMS curves\nare also plotted for reference: Turner (1976) in blue;\nBlaauw (1963) in pink; and Schmidt-Kaler (1982) in green\n(dashed). Orange dotted (lower) and dashed (upper)\n\ncurves in figure 5 show ZAMS curves that would yield\ndistances of NGC 281 to be 2.2 kpc and 3.5 kpc (i.e. the\ndistance discrepancy of NGC 281 from previous studies),\nmade by additionally shifting the ZAMS by Turner (1976),\nfrom which Guetter & Turner (1997) obtained a photometric distance to NGC 281 of 2.94 kpc.\nFigure 5 clearly shows the NGC 281 data agree well with\nthe empirical ZAMS curves, and that resolving the large\ndistance discrepancy of NGC 281 from previous studies\nwas important. The agreement of the parallactic distance\nwith the photometric distance is important for confirming\nthe accuracy of the correction for extinction or reddening\nin photometric studies such as Guetter & Turner (1997)\nand for enhancing the precision of the H-R diagram.\nOur determination of the parallactic distance to\nNGC 281 therefore contributes to the extension of the H-R\ndiagram for the study of high-mass stars and, furthermore,\nopens up new possibilities of using the H-R diagram with\nparallax measurements for Galaxy-scale studies, for example, investigating the formation of the Galaxy via the\ndifference in the H-R diagram for components such as the\n\n\f14\n\nM. Sato et al.\n\nbulge and spiral arms. Further contributions are expected\nwith the VLBI techniques and with VERA for direct parallax determination far beyond the solar neighborhood toward a comprehensive understanding of the Galaxy.\n5.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this paper, we have presented the results of our multiepoch phase-referencing observations with VERA over 18\nmonths of an H2 O maser source in the Galactic starforming region NGC 281 West, associated with a fragmenting superbubble \u223c 300 pc above the Perseus spiral\narm. The primary results are summarized as follows:\n1. We detected a trigonometric parallax of\n0.355\u00b10.030 mas, corresponding to a distance\nof 2.82\u00b10.24 kpc to NGC 281. Our parallactic\ndistance agrees well with the photometric distance\nof 2.94\u00b10.15 kpc derived by Guetter & Turner\n(1997), allowing for improved study of the absolute\nmagnitutudes of high-mass OB stars, and resolved\nthe large distance discrepancy of NGC 281 from\nprevious photometric and kinematic studies.\n2. We revised the absolute proper motions of the\nH2 O maser features measured in Sato et al. (2007),\nand using our new determination of the parallactic\ndistance, we derived more precisely the velocity\ncomponent of the NGC 281 region vb \u2243 18 km s\u22121\nperpendicular to the Galactic plane. This yields\na timescale of tb \u223c 17 Myr and kinectic energy of\nthe region to be 3.0 \u00d7 1051 ergs in the direction\nperpendicular to the plane.\n3. We demonstrated the 3D structure and expansion\nof the NGC 281 superbubbles in comparison of our\nparallactic distance to NGC 281 with the parallactic\ndistance derived by Moellenbrock et al. (2007) for\nanother H2 O maser source, IRAS 00420+5530 in\nthe superbubble. Our new parallactic distance\nrevealed the structure of the superbubble \u223c650\npc in size parallel to the Galactic disk and with a\nshape slightly elongated along the disk or spherical,\nbut not vertically elongated in the z direction.\nTherefore, the superbubble expansion may be\nconfined to the disk, possibly due to the magnetic\nfield of the disk.\n4. We suggested a new possible interpretation of an\nexpanding molecular ring parallel to the Galactic\nplane in the longitude-velocity diagram by Megeath\net al. (2002, 2003). In either interpretation, the\nring center, i.e. the likely origin of the superbubble\nlies at l \u2243 121\u25e6 . The velocity deviation of the\nsuperbubble from the Galactic rotation is estimated\nto be \u223c 10 km s\u22121 inward the Galactic rotation\nand toward the Sun from our proper motion measurements and from the longitude-velocity diagram,\nwhich might be due to velocity jumps over a spiral\n\n[Vol. ,\nshock in the Perseus spiral arm.\n\n5. We also estimated the velocity component and\ntimescale of the ring expansion to be vring2 \u2243 15 \u2212\n20 km s\u22121 and tring2 \u223c 16 \u2212 21 Myr, respectively,\nparallel to the Galactic plane, which are in good\nagreement with those independently estimated for\nthe direction perpendicular to the Galactic plane,\nvb \u2243 18 km s\u22121 and tb \u223c 17 Myr. The kinetic energy estimate of the region parallel to the plane is\n2.1 \u00d7 1051 ergs, and the total kinetic energy of both\nperpendicular and parallel to the plane is then estimated to be 5.1 \u00d7 1051 ergs, requiring multiple supernovae.\nWe are deeply grateful to the referee Dr. Felix J.
