There are two main approaches for pairing,\ndepending whether the mean field is based on Gogny finite range interaction or on Skyrme interaction. In the\nfirst approach, a similar functional is used in both the\nparticle-hole channel and the pairing channel, although\ninteractions are not exactly the same due to the density\ndependence of the pairing interaction. In the Skyrme approach, the functionals are meant to be different in the\ntwo channels, as witnessed for instance by their density\ndependence. The use of a different interaction in the\nparticle-hole channel and in the pairing channel has been\njustified a decade ago [2]; this is for instance the case\nof employing the Skyrme interaction in the particle-hole\nchannel and a zero range density dependent interaction\nin the pairing channel. We shall focus on the Skyrme\napproach: in this case the pairing density functional is\ndifficult to constrain and it has not been possible to derive an universal pairing interaction during past decades,\nusing for instance the odd-even mass staggering on finite nuclei (see e.g. [3, 4]). This may indicate the need\nfor another approach, using additional constrains: should\nthe pairing density functional be extended, and are there\nadditional relevant observables to constrain it ?\nNuclear matter could help in constraining the pairing\nfunctional. This requires however to bridge nuclei and\nnuclear matter through LDA in the pairing channel: its\ncondition of validity should be more systematically analysed. It has been recently shown that the two paired neutrons are spatially localised in low density medium which\ncorresponds to the surface of the nucleus [5]. The same\nconclusion is drawn by analysing the di-neutron configuration in the excited states [6, 7], and also performing\ncalculations in low density matter in [8, 9], mainly renewing the possibility to link in some cases the nuclear matter\nand nuclei in the pairing channel through the LDA.\nConcomitantly the pairing functional has been extended in order to study the condensation of the Cooper\npairs (BEC-BCS crossover) in both symmetric and neutron matter. In nuclear matter the medium polarization\nincreases the pairing gap at low densities in symmetric\nmatter, whereas it reduces the gap in neutron matter, in-\n\ndicating an isospin dependence of the pairing functional\n[10]. The application to finite nuclei of extended pairing\ndensity functional have shown the relevance of the LDA\nin the pairing channel [11].\nThe pairing functional studies may thus enter in a new\nera, renewing the method to design the pairing interaction: i) using an isospin dependence of the pairing interaction ii) using eventually the nuclear matter as an additional constrain for the pairing interaction iii) looking for\nadditional observables in nuclei than the odd-even mass\nstaggering to constrain the pairing interaction. Point i)\nhas been investigated in [10, 11]. Point ii) requires the\nvalidity of the LDA in the pairing channel and shall be\naddressed in the present work.\nIn the case of point iii) an interesting observable is pairing vibrations, measured through two-particle transfer.\nIt is well known that the transfer cross section crucially\ndepends on the pairing interaction at work in the transferred paired [12, 13]. However in the 70-80's the form\nfactor of the transition has never been calculated fully\nmicroscopically. The first microscopic calculations has\nbeen performed only recently [14], allowing for a strong\nlink between the pairing interaction and pairing vibrations. Several calculations followed [6, 15], showing the\nrenewed interest for such studies.\nIt is therefore meaningful to use pairing vibrations as\na complementary observable to the masses, in order to\nconstrain the pairing interaction, and study the implications to the nuclear matter. More generally, the isospin\nextension of the pairing interaction should be accompanied with additional constraints. One purpose of this\nwork is to evaluate if pairing vibrations could play this\nrole (Section III).\nThe method is to analyse the sensitivity of pairing vibrations to various pairing interactions which provide the\nsame two-neutron separation energy in Tin isotopes, and\nevaluate the consequences on the pairing gap in symmetric and neutron matter. On this purpose it is necessary\nto determine the range of density where the LDA is valid\nin the pairing channel (Section II).\n\n\f2\n0,16\n124\n\nDensities\n\nTABLE I: Values of \u03b7 and V0 of the pairing interaction.\n\nSn\nSn\n\n0,12\n\nII.\n\nV0 (MeV fm\n-285\n-390\n-670\n\n)\n\nVALIDITY OF THE LDA IN THE PAIRING\nCHANNEL\n\nAfter many years of study, there is still no unambiguous universal pairing functional ranging on the whole\nnuclear chart, and current efforts are aiming in that direction. The problem may be due to the method used\nto constrain it, namely comparing the pairing gap with\nodd-even mass differences, or evaluating the separation\nenergies along a given isotopic chain. It therefore may be\nuseful to consider a more general context: the evaluation\nof several pairing interactions constrained by odd-even\nmass difference, on nuclear matter on one side, and on\nadditional observables on the other side, should shed a\nrenewed light on the problem. To achieve this goal it is\nfirst necessary to determine the range of validity of the\nLDA in the pairing channel.\n\nA.\n\n136\n\n0,08\n\n0,04\n\nPairing field\n\n\u03b7\n0.35\n0.65\n1\n\n\u22121\n\n0\n-0,8\n-1,6\n-2,4\n\nSurface interaction\nMixed interaction\n\n-3,2\n-4\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\nr (fm)\nFIG. 1: Upper panel: Matter densities calculated with the\nHFB model for 124 Sn and 136 Sn.

The parameters\nare determined so as to describe the two neutron separation energy. Then pairing vibrations are used in order\nto disentangle between the various pairing interactions\n(Section III). We choose 124 Sn and 136 Sn nuclei: these\nare spherical nuclei where pairing vibrations are likely\nto occur [13]. One is stable and the second has a large\nneutron excess.\nThe microscopic calculations for the ground state are\nbased on the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) model.\nThe Skyrme interaction SLy4 [16] is chosen for the\nparticle-hole channel of the HFB equations.

We set \u03b1 = 1 and \u03c10 = 0.16 fm\u22123 . The numerical cutoff for the microscopic calculations is given by\nEmax = 60 MeV (in quasiparticle energies) and jmax =\n15/2. For each value of \u03b7, V0 is chosen to fit the known\nexperimental two-neutron separation energies for Sn isotopes. Surface and mixed interactions have been considered in this work and the used values of (\u03b7,V0 ) are listed\nin Table I.\n\nB.\n\nPairing gap in uniform matter\n\nThe relation between the pairing gap in uniform matter\nat a given density and the pairing field at a given radius\nin nuclei has been explored in Ref. [11]. It has been found\nthat in the case of mixed interactions, the LDA is in good\nagreement with the full microscopic HFB calculation (differences less than 15% on the pairing field). This might\nbe related to the extension of the Cooper pair which is\ngetting smaller at the surface of nuclei (about 2 fm) compared to that in the interior (about 5-6 fm) [5]. Close to\nthe surface, pairing properties shall not be very different from that of a uniform piece of matter at the same\ndensity. It is then interesting to explore the low density\nproperties of the different pairing interactions listed in\nTable I.\nFig. 2 displays the pairing gap in uniform matter for\nvarious pairing interactions. It is observed that the different interactions leads to very different pairing gap at low\ndensity while around saturation density, there is a density (\u03c1=0.11 fm\u22123 ) at which the pairing gap and pairing\nstrength coincide for the three pairing interactions.\nFrom Fig. 2, two conclusions can be drawn: i) the twoneutron separation energy used to adjust the parameters\nof the pairing interaction is an observable which provides\na strong constrain on the pairing gap localized at the surface of the nuclei: the pairing gap in nuclear matter has\nbeen constrained for \u03c1=0.11 fm\u22123 , which corresponds to\n\n\f3\n\n8\n\u03b7=1\n\n8\n\npairing gap \u2206 (MeV)\n\nPairing gap \u2206 (MeV)\n\n\u03b7=0.35\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0,05\n\n0,1\n\n0,15\n\n\u03b7 =1 (Mat)\n\u03b7 =1 (Nucl)\n\n4\n\n\u03b7=0.65\n\n0,2\n\n0\n4\n\u03b7 =0.65 (Mat)\n\u03b7 =0.65 (Nucl)\n\n2\n0\n3\n2\n1\n0\n\n\u03b7 =0.35 (Mat)\n\u03b7 =0.35 (Nucl)\n\n0\n\n0,05\n\n-3\n\n0,1\n\n0,15\n\n0,2\n\n-3\n\n\u03c1 (fm )\n\n\u03c1 (fm )\n\nFIG. 2: Pairing gap versus the density for uniform matter for\ndifferent pairing interactions.\n\nFIG. 3: Pairing gap versus the density for nuclear matter and\nfor 124 Sn (see text)\n\nR \u2243 5 fm in Tin nuclei, as showed by the 124 Sn densities\ndisplayed on Fig. 1 ii) to better constrain the value of\nthe parameter \u03b7, one shall find another observable sensitive to the pairing strength at low density (large radius,\nexperimentally easier to probe). Indeed, in the very external part of the nuclei the pairing strength is very different from one interaction to another. The pure surface\npairing interaction predict a pairing gap as high as 8 MeV\nat low density while the various mixed pairing interaction\nare grouped below 3 MeV (see Fig. 2).\nTherefore, one might expect that properties of collective modes sensitive to the external part of the nuclei\ncould be changed by the properties of the pairing interaction at low density. Pair transferred reaction mechanisms like (p,t) or (\u03b1, 6 He) which is very surface peaked\nshall also help in extracting the value of the pairing gap\nin the external part of the nuclei or equivalently at low\ndensity.\n\nasymmetry are taken as the one of 124 Sn. One can see\nthat the LDA is not valid for a pure surface pairing, but\nbecomes valid in the \u03b7=0.35 mixed case, for densities\nlower than 0.1 fm\u22123 . Therefore, in this case, the low density part of the nuclear matter gap could be constrained\nby nuclei calculations of the gap: a valid case of the LDA\nin the pairing channel is showed here quantitatively for\nthe first time. This range of density corresponds to a\nradius larger than about 5.1 fm in 124 Sn and 5.2 fm in\n136\nSn localised at the surface of the nuclei, as can be seen\non Fig. 1. In the cases of the other pairing interactions,\nthe LDA underestimates the pairing gap at low density\nand overestimate it at high density. However, it should\nbe noted that the relative difference of the gaps between\nthe various pairing interactions are respected.\nAs noted above, to assess in practice the validity of\nthe LDA, the density range around the saturation density should be investigated, where nuclei bulk properties\nare at work. Therefore a large discrepancy at very low\ndensity (\u03c1 \u2264 0.1 fm\u22123 ), as observed in the case of the surface pairing interaction in Fig . 3, does not preclude on\nthe validity of the LDA. More generally it can be stated\nthat the less important the surface contribution to the\npairing interaction, the better the LDA.\n\nC.\n\nValidity of the LDA\n\nOne aim of this work is to investigate the mapping\nof the pairing gap between nuclei and nuclear matter,\nimplying the following relation:\n\u2206\u221e (\u03c1) = \u2206HF B (\u03c1(r) = \u03c1)\n\n(2)\n\nEq. (2) corresponds to the LDA in the pairing channel.\nHowever, it should be noted that in practice, the LDA\nmight still be valid even if Eq. (2) is not verified for very\nlow densities (\u03c1 \u2264 0.1 fm\u22123 ): the major role is played by\ndensities around the saturation density, where nucleus\nproperties are the most important.\nFig. 3 displays the gap calculated with the HFB approach as a function of the nuclei density in 124 Sn. Nuclear matter gap is surimposed, where the neutron-proton\n\nIII.\n\nPAIRING VIBRATIONS\n\nAs stated above, it may be useful to consider an additional observable than the separation energy, in order to\nconstrain the pairing interaction, namely its density dependence. There are only few observables which could be\nrelevant to constrain pairing effects. It has been shown\nthat the first 2+ state in nuclei is sensitive to the pairing\ninteraction [17]: both its position and strength depend\nof the pairing interaction. However this is mainly related\nto the pairing gap value, which is the same observable\n\n\f4\nextracted from odd-even mass excess. It should be noted\nthan none of these two observables (the first 2+ state and\nthe odd-even mass staggering) can be directly linked to\npredictions. On one side there is the difficulty to modelize excited states. On the other side, the difficulty is to\ndescribe odd nuclei.\nPairing vibrations may be more adequate observable.\nThey can be probed for instance with two neutron transfer in nuclei close to shell closure. We refer to [12, 13]\nfor details on pairing vibrations. Basically, these modes\ncorresponds to the (collective) filling of subshells, in transition from an A to A+2 nuclei.\nWith pairing vibrations, pairing effects are probed by\n3 ways. The first one is the magnitude of the pairing\ngap \u2206 (average of the pairing field): a large pairing gap\nimplies strength at larger energies, following the formula\nE2 \u2243(\u01eb \u2212 \u03bb)2 + \u22062 . This component is also present in\nthe first 2+ state in the ph response as well as in the\nodd-even mass staggering. But in the case of the pairing\nvibrations, there are two additional contributions: first,\nthe transition densities generating the strength are the\npairing one, which means that the unperturbed response\nas well as the perturbed response are sensitive to the\nimpact of the pairing on the wave functions. Finally, the\nresidual interaction, generating the QRPA response, is\nalso sensitive to pairing.\nPairing vibrations are therefore expected to be very\nsensitive to the pairing interaction. On the other hand,\nit may also be difficult to disentangle between the three\nabove mentioned effects. However, the first one can be\nevaluated using the energies of the unperturbed response,\nthe second one by studying the pairing transition densities, and the last one by comparing the unperturbed and\nthe QRPA responses. It should be noted that a related\nstudy will also be performed in [18].\nA.\n\nMethod: QRPA in the pp channel\n\nThe method is described in [14, 17]. Namely the QRPA\nequations are solved in coordinate space, using the green\nfunction formalism. The variation of the generalized density R' is expressed in term of 3 quantities, namely \u03c1\u2032 , \u03ba\u2032\nand \u03ba\u0304\u2032 , which are written as a column vector:\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\u03c1\u2032\n\uf8ec \uf8f7\n\u03c1\u2032 = \uf8ed \u03ba \u2032 \uf8f8 ,\n\u03ba\u0304\u2032\nwhere \u03c1\u2032ij =\n\nD\n\n0|c\u2020j ci |\u2032\n\nE\n\n(3)\n\nis the variation of the partiE\nD\ncle density, \u03ba\u2032ij = h0|cj ci |\u2032 i and \u03ba\u0304\u2032ij = 0|c\u2020j c\u2020i |\u2032 are the\nfluctuations of the pairing tensor associated to the pairing vibrations and |\u2032 i denotes the change of the ground\nstate wavefunction |0 > due to the external field. In contrast with the RPA where one needs to know only the\nchange of the ph density (\u03c1\u2032 ), the variation of the three\n\nquantities (3) have to be calculated in the QRPA. In the\nthree dimensional space introduced in Eq. (3), the first\ndimension represents the particle-hole (ph) subspace, the\nsecond the particle-particle (pp) one, and the third the\nhole-hole (hh) one. The response matrix has therefore 9\ncoupled elements in QRPA, compared to one in the RPA\nformalism.\nThe variation of the HFB Hamiltonian is given by:\nH \u2032 = V\u03c1\u2032 ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere V is the matrix of the residual interaction expressed in terms of the second derivatives of the HFB\nenergy functional, namely:\nV\u03b1\u03b2 (r\u03c3, r\u2032 \u03c3 \u2032 ) =\n\n\u22022E\n,\n\u2202\u03c1\u03b2 (r\u2032 \u03c3 \u2032 )\u2202\u03c1\u1fb1 (r\u03c3)\n\n\u03b1, \u03b2 = 1, 2, 3. (5)\n\nIn the above equation the notation \u1fb1 means that whenever \u03b1 is 2 or 3 then \u1fb1 is 3 or 2.\nThe QRPA Green's function G can be used for calculating the strength function associated with the twoparticle transfer from the ground state of a nucleus with\nA nucleons to the excited states of a nucleus with A+2\nnucleons. This strength function is :\n1\nS(\u03c9) = \u2212 Im\n\u03c0\n\nZ\n\nF \u2217 (r)G22 (r, r\u2032 ; \u03c9)F (r\u2032 )dr dr\u2032\n\n(6)\n\nwhere G denotes the (pp,pp) component of the Green's\nfunction and F in the external perturbating field associated with the addition of two particles.\nIn the QRPA calculations the full HFB quasiparticle\nspectrum up to 60 MeV is included. These states are\nused to construct the unperturbed Green's function G0 .\nThe residual interaction is derived from the two-body\nforce used in HFB according to Eq. (5). The contribution given by the velocity-dependent terms of the\nSkyrme force to the residual interaction is calculated in\nthe Landau-Migdal approximation, which is shown to be\naccurate [19]. The strength function for the two-neutron\ntransfer is calculated using Eq. (6). The unperturbed\nGreen's function is calculated with an averaging interval\nequal to 0.15 MeV. All details can be found in Ref. [14].\nThe response function is calculated for the pp channel.\nAll the calculations are performed in a box of size 22.5\nfm. It should be noted that exact continuum treatment\nis much heavier, especially for nuclei such as Sn isotopes.\nMoreover the aim is not to study the impact of the continuum treatment (see [14] for such a study). Finally the\nSn isotopes under study are far from the drip line, and\ncontinuum effects are expected to play a negligible role.\nB.\n\nUnperturbed response results\n\nThe HFB solutions are used in the quasiparticle\nrandom-phase approximation (QRPA) scheme to analyze\n\n\f5\nself-consistently the excitations modes associated to the\npair transfer reactions. Since we study here two-neutron\ntransfers, we focus on the neutron HFB quasiparticle\nstates that are used to construct the elementary configurations of the excited modes. We work with positiveenergy quasiparticle states. Once calculated the quasiparticle spectrum, it is possible to deduce some properties of the unperturbed response function.\nThe quasiparticle states with energy less than 6 MeV\nand an occupation probability \u2264 80 % are presented in\nTables II and III for 124 Sn and 136 Sn, respectively. Let\nus discuss the two cases \u03b7 = 0.35 and \u03b7 = 1 (for \u03b7 = 0.65,\nresults are similar to those obtained with \u03b7 = 0.35). For\n124\nSn, in the case of a mixed pairing interaction, \u03b7 = 0.35,\nall the quasiparticle states with energy lower than 5 MeV\nare totally occupied with the exception of a h11/2 state\nat 1.5 MeV which is 42% occupied. This is the only lowenergy state that can contribute to some extent to the excitation mode. The states that are completely empty and\ncan thus contribute more to the excitation are located at\nhigher energies. The first is an f7/2 state at 5.8 MeV.\nThe others have larger energies (at least 1 MeV more).\nOne can thus expect that the unperturbed response profile starts with a peak at twice 5.8 MeV, i.e. at \u223c 11.6\nMeV (with some small contribution at 3 MeV). In the\ncase of a surface interaction, \u03b7 = 1, again, all the states\nbetween 0 and 5 MeV are occupied with the exception of\na h11/2 state at 2.2 MeV (42% of occupation). This time\nthere are several unoccupied states just above 5 MeV, the\nlowest energy being at 5.4 MeV (p3/2 state). Hence, the\nunperturbed response is expected to have some structure\nstarting from \u223c 10.8 MeV with a small contribution at\n\u223c 4.4 MeV.\nFor the nucleus 136 Sn the situation is different: there\nare several low-lying unoccupied states. For \u03b7 = 0.35 the\nlowest energy for a completely unoccupied state is 1.9\nMeV (p3/2 state). At 0.8 MeV one also finds a f7/2 state\nwith 45% of occupation. In the case \u03b7 = 1 the lowest\nenergy for a totally unoccupied state is 1.7 MeV (p3/2\nstate) and a f7/2 state is found at 1.6 MeV with 32%\nof occupation. The unperturbed response is expected to\nstart at \u223c 3.8 and 3.2 MeV for \u03b7 = 0.35 and 1, respectively. In the former case a small contribution at \u223c 1.6\nMeV is also expected.\nIn order to disentangle between the various pairing effects, the unperturbed response in the two neutrons addition mode is first shown on Fig. 4 for 124 Sn. The unperturbed response is built on the HFB single quasiparticle (QP) spectrum, for the three pairing interactions.\nIt should be noted that the spectrum is showed above 10\nMeV, because there is only the h11/2 subshell which can\nwelcome two neutrons to make a low energy state: all\nthe other configurations belong to the next major shell\n(see Table II), explaining this high energy feature of the\nspectrum, as stated above. For all the mixed pairing interaction, the unperturbed spectrum is similar, showing\nthat both the single quasiparticle energy and wave functions are close to each other in that case.

The lower energy shift can be understood by more single QP states located at low energy.\nThis can be explained by a lower pairing gap and a different energy spectrum found in the HFB self-consistent\n\n\f6\n\n14\n14\n12\n10\n\n-1\n\nS(E ) (MeV )\n\n-1\n\nS(E ) (MeV )\n\n12\n10\n\n*\n\n8\n\n*\n\n6\n4\n\n8\n6\n4\n\n2\n\n2\n\n0\n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20\n*\n\n0\n\nE (MeV)\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n*\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\nE (MeV)\n\nFIG. 4: Unperturbed response function for 124 Sn in the two\nneutrons 0+ addition mode.

The larger magnitude comes from the wave\nfunctions, and will be studied with the QPRA response.\nIt can be already stated that the QRPA response will also\nhave more strength at lower energy, due to this peculiar\nfeature of the unperturbed spectrum for the pure surface\npairing force.\nFig. 5 shows the unperturbed response for the two\nneutron addition mode in 136 Sn. In this case, at the\nbeginning of an open neutron shell several low energies\nconfigurations can welcome the two neutrons (see Table\nIII). As in the case of 124 Sn, the response exhibits larger\nstrength at low energy in the specific case of the pure\nsurface pairing interaction, compared to others pairing\ninteraction. This is related to the pairing field profile as\nshown on Fig. 1. It should be noted that in order to\nclearly see the effect due to the surface pairing, not only\nthe first 0+ state, but also the energy area of a few MeV\nabove should be explored since the results are different\nfrom 0 to 4 MeV on Fig. 5.\n\nis expected that the pairing vibration transition strength\nshould be larger in the case of a pure surface force. However it is known that it is difficult to describe accurately\nthe magnitude of these transitions, especially for absolute cross section calculations [20]: one-step or sequential two-step process, triton wave function, zero-range or\nfinite-range DWBA have to be considered. It is therefore\nnecessary to rely on the angular distribution, calculated\nfrom the form factor, related itself to the pairing transition density [13].\nThe pairing transition density is defined as:\n\nC.\n\nPerturbed response results\n\nFig. 6 shows the QRPA response for 124 Sn, with a pure\nsurface and the two mixed interactions. As expected the\nresidual interaction plays a similar role in all the cases,\ngathering strength and shifting it to lower energy. In the\ncase of 124 Sn, a peak around 9 MeV is the strongest for\nthe surface pairing interaction, to be compared with the\none around 10 MeV for the other interactions. Hence it\n\n\u03ba\u03bd (r, \u03c3) = h0|c (r, \u03c3\u0304) c (r, \u03c3) |\u03bdi\n\n(7)\n\nwhere c\u2020 (r, \u03c3\u0304)= \u22122\u03c3c\u2020 (r, \u2212\u03c3) is its time reversed counterpart.\nIt allows to calculate the form factor in the zero-range\nDWBA approximation. The pairing transition densities\nof Fig. 7 show, in the case of 124 Sn, a difference, going from surface to other modes: the transition density\ndecreases at the surface. However the difference is not\ndramatic and may be overruled by the experimental uncertainties. The larger strength of the 9 MeV peak in the\npure surface pairing interaction is due to a larger density\nat the surface.\nFor the 136 Sn neutron-rich nucleus, the low energy\nspectrum displayed on Fig. 8 is dramatically changed\nfrom using surface to other interactions, on a several MeV\narea. A three peaks structure appears in the surface case,\ncompared to the 2 peak structure of the other cases. The\nintegrated strength is also larger in the surface case.\n\n\f7\n\n25\n\n40\n35\n\n-1\n\nS(E ) (MeV )\n\n25\n20\n\n*\n\n*\n\n-1\n\nS(E ) (MeV )\n\n20\n30\n\n15\n\n15\n\n10\n\n10\n5\n5\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n-3\n\n\u03b4\u03ba (fm )\n\n0.03\n\n0.02\n\n0.01\n\n0\n\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n\nr (fm)\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\nFIG. 8: QRPA response function for 136 Sn in the two neutrons\n0+ addition mode. The pure surface mode is in solid line,\nthe \u03b7=0.65 mode is in dotted line, and the \u03b7=0.35 mode in\ndashed-dotted lines.\n\nFig. 9 and 10 show the corresponding transition densities. They exhibit very different shapes, comparing results with the pure surface pairing interaction and the\nmixed pairing interaction. Hence 136 Sn is a good test\ncase to probe the pairing interaction through pairing vibrations. For instance in the case of the most intense\npeak, the central part is dominant in the transition density for the mixed case, whereas the surface part of the\ntransition density dominates in the pure surface interaction. Hence a measurement of the angular distributions\nassociated with the pairing vibration strength in very\nneutron rich-nuclei such as 136 Sn seems more decisive to\ndisentangle between the pairing interactions than with\n136\nSn. This may be due to the larger neutron skin in\n136\nSn, consisting of low density neutron-rich matter.\nIt has been shown in a previous work how the pairing\ntransition densities allow to calculate the two neutron\nform factor in order to predict angular distributions for\npairing vibrations [14]. Work along these lines should be\nundertaken in order to bring additional constrains on the\npairing interaction.\n\nIV.\nFIG. 7: Neutron transition density in the two neutrons addition mode for 124 Sn for the first peak located at 9-10 MeV.\nThe pure surface mode is in solid line, the \u03b7=0.65 mode is in\ndotted line, and the \u03b7=0.35 mode in dashed-dotted lines.\n\n10\n\nE (MeV)\n\nE (MeV)\nFIG. 6: QRPA response function for 124 Sn in the two neutrons\n0+ addition mode.

They should provide a good sensitivity from a pure surface interaction\ncompared to mixed interactions, especially in the case\n\n\f8\nof very neutron-rich nuclei such as 136 Sn. Moreover nuclear matter gap calculations show that the LDA in the\npairing channel is valid in the surface of the nuclei for\nthe \u03b7 = 0.35 mixed surface/volume interaction, but not\nrigorously valid in other cases. In the case of exotic nuclei, pairing vibrations are found more sensitive to the\nsurface/volume type of the pairing interaction, than in\nthe case of stable nuclei. This may be due to the larger\nextension of the neutron density in very neutron-rich nuclei.\n\n-3\n\n\u03b4\u03ba (fm )\n\n0.03\n\n0.02\n\n0.01\n\n0\n\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n\nr (fm)\n\nThe same study using an isospin dependent pairing interaction will be undertaken.
