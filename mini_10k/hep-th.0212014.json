We argue that holography probably forbids all cosmological violations of the NEC, and that holography is in fact the\nfundamental physical principle underlying the cosmological version of the NEC.\n\n\f1. The Status of the Null Energy Condition\nOne of the major themes of recent theory has been the concept of holography, which\noriginated from considerations of black hole entropy. This aspect of holography has been\ndeveloped into the Covariant Entropy Bound, introduced by Bousso in [1]. [We shall\nmostly follow the recent review paper [2]]. The entropy bound is particularly important as\na testing ground for holographic ideas because it has been articulated with great precision\nand clarity.\nPrevious discussions of the entropy bound have assumed the validity of the Null Energy\nCondition [NEC], which just requires that for any null vector k a , the stress tensor should\nsatisfy\nTab k a k b \u2265 0.\n(1)\nIn general, this condition is not particularly well-motivated, unless one is also assuming\nthe Weak Energy Condition [which implies the NEC by continuity]; the physical meaning\nof \"observers\" moving at the speed of light is dubious indeed. But it is rather reasonable\nhere. For without it we must expect, in general, to find zero-vorticity null congruences\nwith permanently negative expansion, and this would generically lead to \"lightsheets\" [2]\nwith infinite entropy. Until very recently, in any case, few doubted the universal validity of the NEC [except perhaps in very exotic circumstances, remote from observations\n[3]]. Furthermore, it was generally thought that there are strong theoretical reasons for\ndoubting the existence of NEC-violating matter.\nThe sensational failure of the Strong Energy Condition revealed by the discovery of\ncosmic acceleration [4] has, however, changed many attitudes to energy conditions. Recently, old arguments for the NEC have been challenged [5][6][7][8] and the observational\nsituation has been reviewed more critically [9]. As the full extent of the challenge to\nthe NEC does not appear to have been widely appreciated, let us very briefly survey the\ncurrent position.\nThere is now convincing observational evidence that the density of the baryonic and\ndark matter in our universe is far smaller than the critical density. Yet the many successes\nof the CDM model provide, along with the cosmic microwave data obtained in recent\nyears, an almost equally convincing argument that the universe is spatially flat. General\nRelativity then implies that our world must contain vast quantities of \"dark energy\"\nwith a positive density which reconciles the two sets of observations. The celebrated\nsupernova observations merely confirm this conclusion. [See [10] for a cautious review of\nthe observations.]\nNone of this is very strange; the fact that we cannot \"see\" most of the contents of\nour universe is regrettable but not unexpected. What is strange is the time evolution\nof the density of the dark energy. At the time of the synthesis of the light elements,\nits density must have been negligible compared with the density of radiation. Yet today\nit dominates all other forms of matter and energy combined. The usual inference is\nthat the dark energy has an extraordinary property: its density does not change as the\nuniverse expands. [Alternatively, it is assumed that its density declines very slowly, as\nin quintessence models; see [10].] This is the cosmological constant model. But if we are\nwilling to entertain such a strange possibility, we should also be willing to consider the\npossibility that the dark energy density actually increases as the universe expands. This\n2\n\n\fis, after all, the most obvious interpretation of the facts: the dark energy density was\nnegligible in the past, is dominant now, and presumably - unless we are privileged to\nlive at a very special point in time - will be still more dominant in the future.\nIn fact, Frampton [11] has recently argued that exotic dispersion relations [motivated\nby \"stringy dark energy\" cosmologies [12], descendants of the well-known BrandenbergerVafa cosmologies [13]], naturally lead to an increasing density for the dark energy. While\nthe basis of the particular model discussed in [11] is somewhat controversial [14], the basic\nidea that non-standard dispersion relations can lead naturally to an increasing density is\nworth exploring, even if it is true that a realistic model requires fine-tuning. To see the\nconsequences of this, consider the equation expressing the vanishing of the divergence of\nthe dark energy stress tensor [15]:\nda\nd\u03c1\n+ 3(\u03c1 + p) /a = 0.\ndt\ndt\n\n(2)\n\nd ln(\u03c1)\n= \u22123(1 + w),\nd ln(a)\n\n(3)\n\nThis may be written as\n\nwhere w is the dark energy equation-of-state parameter, the ratio of its pressure to its\ndensity, and a is the scale factor. Thus we see that the density is constant if w = \u22121,\nthe case of a cosmological constant, and that it increases as the universe expands only if\nw < \u22121. Thus the idea that the dark energy density is increasing requires us to take such\nvalues seriously.\nWhile Frampton's theory appears to be the first string-based model actually to require\nw < \u22121 as a matter of basic principle, violations of the NEC have in fact been proposed\nin quite a number of recent works. We shall now give a very compressed and incomplete\nsurvey of this literature. The intention here is not to persuade the reader that the NEC is\nviolated either in cosmology or otherwise, but merely to demonstrate that such violations\nare not completely out of the question. The relevant works can be roughly categorised as\nfollows.\nFirst, one of the earliest instances of a challenge to the NEC arose in connection\nwith inflation, where, in some versions, upward fluctuations of the Hubble parameter are\nrequired. The Einstein equations imply that such fluctuations must violate the NEC. See\n[16] for a discussion of this.\nSecond, scalar fields have of course long played an important role in cosmology, and\nnon-minimally coupled scalars can easily lead to interesting violations of the NEC. See\nfor example [17][18][19][20], and also [21] for a different approach.\nThird, it is well known that quantum effects can lead to local violations of the NEC;\nsee [22][23][24] for a sample of recent important work, and note that some of this work calls\ninto question the widespread belief that quantum violations of the NEC are necessarily\ntightly constrained, particularly in higher dimensions. Violations of the NEC arising\nin quantum field theory have been directly applied to cosmology in several papers by\nParker and collaborators [25]; this work is notable for its specific prediction that w should\nindeed be less than \u22121. See also [26]. Quantum gravity theories can also lead to such\nphenomena: see for example [27], which requires strong violations of the NEC in the\nremote past [though not at present].\n3\n\n\fFourth, [at least temporary] violations of the NEC are required in many models which\nattempt to replace the Big Bang with a [smooth] \"bounce\". Much of this work has been\nstimulated by the \"cyclic\" and \"ekpyrotic\" theories [28][29]. See [30][31] for a sample of\nthis literature. It is particularly important to note that bounces can arise from effective\nviolations of the NEC when a generalised action involving higher-derivative terms is used.\nThis point is explored in a major work of Tsujikawa, Brandenberger, and Finelli [32].\nFifth, NEC violations appear quite naturally in braneworld cosmologies: see [33] and\nits references for examples. The w < \u22121 aspect is discussed explicitly in [34]. Recently\nDabrowski and co-workers [35][36] have made the claim that realistic braneworld cosmologies actually demand w < \u22121. A very important development in this line is the\nwork of Kachru and McAllister [37], who discuss an NEC-violating braneworld model in\nthe context of the Klebanov-Strassler solution of a Calabi-Yau compactification of II B\nstring theory. Whether or not it is realistic, this example is important because it is often\nargued against NEC-violating theories that the underlying matter fields violate unitarity.\nThat is indeed the case for very simple matter models, such as a single scalar field, but\nthe Kachru-McAllister example shows that it may not be so in more complicated cases.\nThe point is that apparent misbehaviour of an effective four-dimensional theory can be\nalleviated at a higher level. Notice too that this example indicates that string theory is\nnot completely incompatible with violations of the NEC.\nFinally, and of course most importantly, the observational evidence for the Cosmological NEC [that is, the statement that w \u2265 \u22121] is not entirely convincing, as Caldwell [9]\nnoted in a seminal paper; see also [38][39][40][41][42] for observationally-oriented papers in\nwhich the possibility that w could be less than \u22121 is considered. One very recent analysis\n[43] of the data claims, very tentatively, that they support the NEC; another [44], almost\nsimultaneous, claims that w < \u22121 is still a very real possibility. In short, the NEC is\nnot, as is widely believed, well supported by the observations: the data are, at present,\ninconclusive.\nWe can summarise all this very simply: there are good theoretical and observational\nreasons to question the universal validity of the NEC. This does not mean that the NEC,\nor its cosmological version, should be abandoned forthwith. What it does mean is that\nthe truth of the NEC is not a trivial matter; it is no longer acceptable merely to assume\nit without further comment.\nIn this work, we shall be concerned exclusively with the Cosmological NEC. As is\nemphasised in [43], the distinction is important, because the existence of NEC-violating\nmatter at the cosmological level does not imply that we can necessarily isolate or manipulate \"chunks\" of such matter so as to construct exotic objects such as wormholes.\nConversely, it may be possible to give theoretical arguments which support the Cosmological NEC, without implying that the NEC is universally valid. If it is eventually\nconfirmed that the data point to w \u2265 \u22121, this will mean that the Cosmological NEC is\nan observational fact requiring a theoretical explanation, just as the cosmic acceleration\nis a fact requiring explanation. We propose to seek this explanation in holography, in the\nparticular guise discussed by Bousso in [2].\nWhile the NEC is, as explained earlier, very useful in discussions of the entropy bound,\nit does not of course follow that the NEC is absolutely necessary here. In some cases,\nthe NEC-violating matter could be such that the entropy on lightsheets is still always\n4\n\n\ffinite. If such examples can be found, then perhaps [a suitably modified version of] the\nentropy bound need no longer rely on the NEC. We shall present an extremely simple\nexample of this kind. It is motivated by the \"self-tuning\" brane cosmologies. [See [45]\nfor a recent discussion and for references.] In these models, the cosmological constant\non the braneworld is automatically \"tuned away\" by the bulk, and the brane becomes\nflat. It has been shown by Cline and Firouzjahi [46][47] that the most promising versions\nof this idea actually require a violation of the NEC in the bulk [granted that it is not\nviolated on the brane], so this is quite a natural context for considering NEC-violation.\n[Another unusual, and possibly related, form of matter in the bulk is the Casimir energy.\nSee [48] and its references.] We stress, however, that we are not proposing this as even a\nquasi-realistic braneworld model. We shall not discuss the binding of the graviton to the\nbrane, the effect of more complicated models of NEC-violating matter, whether there are\ninteresting perturbations away from exact flatness of the brane, and so on. Our objectives\nare more basic: we simply wish to determine whether this form of holography can make\nsense in the presence of very simple NEC-violating matter.\nThe example is obtained, after a brief explanation of the usual motivation for using\nthe NEC, by simply introducing NEC-violating matter into AdS5 in such a manner that\nthe negative cosmological constant on the well-known Karch-Randall brane [49][50] is\nrelaxed to zero. A numerical investigation shows that the entropy on lightsheets emanating\nfrom the brane remains finite, confirming that the NEC is not necessary to ensure this.\nNevertheless, in the following section we show that the holographic formulation of this\nsituation is not just physically unrealistic - it is internally inconsistent, by the BoussoRandall consistency condition [51]. The meaning of this is discussed in the Conclusion.\n\n2. The Raychaudhuri Equation and Lightsheets\nGiven a surface of n \u2212 1 spatial dimensions and area A in an n + 1 dimensional spacetime,\nthe n dimensional null hypersurfaces corresponding to null geodesics pointing directly\ntowards directions in which the expansion, \u03b8, is non-positive, are called [2] lightsheets.\nThe Covariant Entropy Bound states that the entropy on any lightsheet is bounded by\nA/4 in Planck units. Obviously it is desirable that lightsheets should terminate at a finite\ndistance, since otherwise we are in danger of having infinite entropy on the lightsheet.\n[Actually this does not necessarily follow, since the geometry may be such that infinite\ndistance corresponds to finite volume, as in the case of the Poincar\u00e9 patch of AdS. Even\nif the volume is infinite, the relevant energy density may decay towards infinity - in\nfact this must be the case if we are to obtain an asymptotically AdS spacetime - and\nso infinite volume might correspond to finite energy and perhaps finite entropy. Usually,\nhowever, the volume elements of asymptotically AdS spaces increase too rapidly for this\nto save the day.]\nBy definition, the lightsheet terminates when the expansion is about to become positive. The null version of the Raychaudhuri equation [[52], page 222],\n\u22121 2\nd\u03b8\n=\n\u03b8 \u2212 \u03c3ab \u03c3 ab + \u03c9ab \u03c9 ab \u2212 8\u03c0Tab k a k b ,\n(4)\nd\u03bb\nn\u22121\nwhere \u03bb is an affine parameter for a null geodesic congruence, k a is the tangent vector,\n\u03c3ab is the shear, and \u03c9ab is the vorticity, shows that lightsheets must terminate at a finite\n5\n\n\fvalue of the affine parameter, provided that the vorticity is zero and the NEC is satisfied.\n[The equation governing the evolution of the vorticity [[52], page 223] ensures that if the\ncongruence is initially hypersurface-normal, then the vorticity is permanently zero, so we\ncan ignore this term.] For in that case, the right side is clearly negative if the initial value\nof \u03b8 is non-zero, and it is easy to show that \u03b8 tends to \u2212\u221e at a finite value of \u03bb. Again,\nfor a generic geometry, this means that all lightsheets end on a caustic at a finite distance\nfrom the initial area. If the NEC is not satisfied away from the initial surface, then there\nare various possibilities.\nFirstly, of course, the first two terms on the right hand side may still dominate, and\na caustic may still form. The entropy on the lightsheet will then still be finite. However,\none could try to argue as follows. It is clear from the Raychaudhuri equation that the\nintroduction of NEC-violating matter will cause the right-hand side of the equation, and\ntherefore the slope of \u03b8 as a function of \u03bb, to become less negative. This will mean that\nthe caustic will form at a larger value of \u03bb, so the lightsheet may extend farther. In a\nsituation in which the entropy bound is saturated or nearly saturated, the result could be\na violation of the entropy bound. The problem with this kind of argument is that \u03bb is not\nrelated in any simple, general way to the distance to the caustic. In fact, the relationship\nbetween \u03bb and distance is influenced by the kind of matter we introduce, and so is the\ninitial value of \u03b8. Hence, a larger value of \u03bb does not necessarily mean that the caustic\nhas moved farther away, and so one cannot conclude directly that NEC-violating matter\nendangers the usual entropy bound [in terms of A/4]. Perhaps the usual bound is always\nprotected in this way, though it seems more likely that the A/4 bound does have to be\nreplaced by an expression depending both on A and on some parameter which measures\nthe amount of NEC-violating matter. For the present, the point we wish to stress is that,\nif a caustic still forms, the entropy is at least still bounded, so some kind of simple entropy\nbound might still exist.\nAlternatively, the last term in equation 4 may dominate and cause \u03b8 eventually to\nincrease and become positive without first diverging to \u2212\u221e. This would still be perfectly\nacceptable, since the lightsheet would terminate when \u03b8 vanishes; the entropy would still be\nbounded, again perhaps by some expression involving the area and a parameter measuring\nNEC-violation. [Of course, if the density and pressure are not constant, we could have\nboth kinds of behaviour, depending on the position of the starting point from which one\nuses the Raychaudhuri equation to evolve the expansion.]\nThe problem lies in intermediate cases: for example, if the positive and negative terms\nin the right side of the Raychaudhuri equation both asymptotically approach constant\nvalues and cancel each other, then \u03b8 might asymptotically approach some fixed negative\nvalue or zero, without ever diverging or vanishing. That is, \u03b8 might remain permanently\nnegative, and so the lightsheet might never terminate. [This could of course also happen\nin other ways if the stress-energy tensor is more complex - for example, the final term\nin the Raychaudhuri equation might oscillate permanently, and so on.] Generically [that\nis, unless the geometry or the matter distribution is very special] that would mean that\nthe entropy on the light sheet would not be finite, and so no entropy bound could be\ntrue. Obviously it would be a grave blow to the holographic programme if one could\nconstruct a physically well-motivated example in which a finite area corresponds to a\nvolume containing an infinite amount of entropy.\n6\n\n\fIt is clear from this discussion that it is not possible to make a general statement\nabout what happens to the entropy bound when the NEC is violated. Perhaps the NECviolating matter is such that \u03b8 either always diverges or always vanishes after a finite\naffine parameter value, in which case some kind of entropy bound might continue to make\nsense [if finite affine parameter corresponds to finite distance]. One might think that it\nwould be difficult to construct an example of this kind, however. Surprisingly, guided by\nphysical considerations, one can in fact do this quite easily. This is the subject of the\nnext section.\n\n3. An Example of a NEC-Violating Spacetime With\nFinite Entropy on Lightsheets\nIn view of the above discussion, we propose that a good way to probe fundamental aspects\nof holography is to introduce NEC-violating matter into Anti-deSitter space, AdS5 . The\nhope is that whatever we learn in this way - perhaps from the AdS/CFT correspondence\n- will teach us something about the status of NEC-violating matter in cosmology.\nOf course, there are many ways in which one might do this. As the only form of\nNEC-violating matter which is close to being observed is [possibly] the cosmological dark\nenergy, it is natural to use a \"cosmological\" model of the matter. In cosmology it is\ncustomary to model the matter content of the universe with matter having a constant [or\npiecewise constant] equation-of-state parameter w, simply because the data are not yet\ncapable of detecting variations of w with time. The simplicity of the resulting equation\nof state allows one [53][54] to obtain an exact solution of the Einstein equation, and this\nagain is a major advantage. Therefore, to the extent that the densities and pressures of\nthe NEC-violating matter in our model can have a ratio differing from \u22121, we shall take\nthe ratio to be a constant.\nIn order to obtain a concrete model, we must now choose a particular representation\nof AdS5 . One of the most interesting representations of AdS5 is obtained by foliating it\nby copies of AdS4 . If g(AdSn ) is the metric on AdSn , then this foliation is expressed by\nr\ng(AdS5 ) = dr \u2297 dr + cosh2 ( ) g(AdS4 ),\nL\n\n(5)\n\nwhere r is a coordinate which ranges from \u2212\u221e to +\u221e, and L is the \"radius\" of AdSn .\nThis representation of the metric was used by Karch and Randall [49] to investigate the\n\"locality of localization\". By cutting off the AdS5 bulk at some fixed value of r, one\nobtains a braneworld model with an AdS4 brane. Of course, this is not even a quasirealistic model [but see [55]] since the cosmological constant on the brane is negative;\nin order to make it more realistic, one might try to modify the matter content of the\nbulk in such a way that the negative cosmological constant on the brane relaxes to zero.\nAlthough the models they consider are quite different, the results of Cline and Firouzjahi\n[46][47]suggest that this can probably only be done by using NEC-violating matter. Thus\nwe have a very natural setting for investigating the holography of such matter: introduce\nit into the Karch-Randall model in such a way that the brane cosmological constant is\nreduced to zero. Of course our interest is in the holography of this situation, not in trying\nto produce a truly realistic variant of the Karch-Randall model.\n7\n\n\fWe therefore begin with the familiar ansatz\ng(bulk) = dr \u2297 dr + e2A(r) \u03b7ij dxi \u2297 dxj ,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere r is as above, where A(r) is a function to be determined and \u03b7ij dxi \u2297 dxj is the\nMinkowski metric. This is of course the standard metric ansatz for a bulk corresponding\nto a flat brane; see for example [56]. Now if we consider forms of cosmological matter\nwhich are designed to have pressure p and positive density \u03c1 such that p < \u2212\u03c1 when\nall fields depend only on time, then we shall find that they behave in a similar way if\nwe introduce them into a geometry with a metric of the form given by equation 6. For\nexample, Caldwell [9] considers a toy model of NEC-violating matter obtained simply by\nreversing the sign of the kinetic term in a standard scalar field Lagrangian with a positive\npotential. [See [37] for an example of this kind of behaviour arising in string theory; see\nalso [44][57] for other approaches.] The [five-dimensional] stress tensor of such a field in\nthe geometry given by equation 6 is\n1\nT\u03bc\u03bd = \u2212\u2202\u03bc \u03c6\u2202\u03bd \u03c6 + g\u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03b1 \u03c6\u2202 \u03b1 \u03c6 \u2212 g\u03bc\u03bd V (\u03c6),\n2\n\n(7)\n\nand if we assume now that \u03c6 depends only on r we find that the density is\n1\n\u03c1 = \u2212 (\u03c6\u2032 )2 + V (\u03c6),\n2\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \u03c6\u2032 is the derivative of \u03c6 with respect to r. The pressure transverse to the brane is\n1\npT = \u2212 (\u03c6\u2032 )2 \u2212 V (\u03c6),\n2\n\n(9)\n\nwhile the pressures parallel to the brane are all given by\n1\npP = (\u03c6\u2032 )2 \u2212 V (\u03c6),\n2\n\n(10)\n\nwhich of course is just the negative of \u03c1, as required by Poincar\u00e9 invariance in the direction\nparallel to the brane. We see at once that \u03c1 is always positive for sufficiently large\npotentials, but that pT \u2264 \u2212\u03c1. A similar result holds for the more complicated NECviolating matter discussed by Melchiorri et al [44]. Thus, introducing such matter into\na geometry given by equation 6, we will obtain in general a matter distribution with\nanisotropic pressures; the pressure is equal to minus the density \u03c1 in the direction parallel\nto the brane, and the transverse pressure pT is less than \u2212\u03c1 .\nAs explained earlier, we shall follow cosmological practice and approximate the \"transversal equation of state\" of the NEC-violating matter, whatever it may be, by\npT = w\u03c1,\n\n(11)\n\nwhere w is a constant satisfying w < \u22121. This matter is to be superimposed on the AdS5\nbackground, with its density \u22123/(4\u03c0L2 ) and its pressure +3/(4\u03c0L2). From [56] we have\nEinstein equations\n\u22123\n+ \u03c1),\n(12)\n\u2212 3A\u2032\u2032 \u2212 6(A\u2032 )2 = 8\u03c0(\n4\u03c0L2\n8\n\n\fand\n6(A\u2032 )2 = 8\u03c0(\n\n3\n+ pT ),\n4\u03c0L2\n\nwhere pT is related to \u03c1 by equation 11.\nFrom equation 13 we have\ndpT\n= 12A\u2032 A\u2032\u2032 ,\n8\u03c0\ndr\nand since 12 and 13 imply\n3A\u2032\u2032 = \u22128\u03c0(\u03c1 + pT ),\n\n(13)\n\n(14)\n(15)\n\nwe have\n\ndpT\n= \u22124A\u2032 (\u03c1 + pT ).\ndr\nCombining this with equation 11 we have\ndpT\n= \u22124(1 + w \u22121 )pT .\ndA\n\n(16)\n\n(17)\n\nIt is convenient now to define a parameter \u03b2 by\n\u03b2 = 4(1 + w \u22121 ).\n\n(18)\n\nClearly \u03b2 is a number satisfying 0 < \u03b2 < 4. Solving equation 17 we obtain\npT = \u2212P e\u2212\u03b2A ,\n\n(19)\n\nwhere P is a positive constant. Equation 13 now becomes\n6(A\u2032 )2 = 8\u03c0(\n\n3\n\u2212 P e\u2212\u03b2A ),\n2\n4\u03c0L\n\n(20)\n\nand this is a differential equation to be solved for A.\nThis equation can be solved in terms of elementary functions: we have\neA = (\n\n\u03b2r\n4\u03c0L2 P 1/\u03b2\n) cosh(2/\u03b2) ( ),\n3\n2L\n\n(21)\n\nand so our NEC-violating metric is\ng(NECV ) = dr \u2297 dr + (\n\n\u03b2r\n4\u03c0L2 P 2/\u03b2\n) cosh(4/\u03b2) ( ) \u03b7ij dxi \u2297 dxj .\n3\n2L\n\n(22)\n\nBy scaling the Minkowski coordinates on the brane, we can of course adjust the value of\nP arbitrarily, to suit our convenience. One possible choice is P = 3/4\u03c0L2 , which is useful\n\u03b2r\nfor studying the limit when \u03b2 tends to zero: since the limit of cosh(4/\u03b2) ( 2L\n) is unity, we see\nthat the metric becomes flat. This is reasonable, since in that limit we are simply using\na positive cosmological constant to cancel the background AdS5 negative cosmological\nconstant, and of course the metric should be flat in that case. Another useful choice of\nP , the one we shall adopt henceforth, is obtained by noticing that for values of r tending\nto \u221e, the metric is approximately\ndr \u2297 dr + (\n\n\u03c0L2 P 2/\u03b2 (2r/L)\n) e\n\u03b7ij dxi \u2297 dxj .\n3\n9\n\n(23)\n\n\fThus we regain precisely the standard AdS5 metric near infinity if we choose P = 3/\u03c0L2 .\nOur metric is then\ng(NECV ) = dr \u2297 dr + 4(2/\u03b2) cosh(4/\u03b2) (\n\n\u03b2r\n) \u03b7ij dxi \u2297 dxj ,\n2L\n\n(24)\n\nand this discussion shows that our metric is asymptotic to the AdS5 metric in a quite\nstraightforward sense. Clearly the matter is concentrated near the \"throat\" at r = 0; the\ndensity and pressure must approach the AdS values as we move towards the boundary.\nIn fact we have\n\u03b2r\n\u039b\u03b2\nsech2 ( ),\n(25)\npT + \u03c1 =\n32\u03c0\n2L\nwhere \u039b = \u22126/L2 is the cosmological constant of the background AdS5 . Thus indeed the\n\u039b\u03b2\nNEC-violating combination pT + \u03c1 attains its maximum magnitude | 32\u03c0\n| at r = 0, and it\nincreases towards zero as the boundary is neared.\nLike the Karch-Randall metric, our metric is completely free of all singularities; and,\nas in that case, the form of the metric suggests that the boundary is disconnected; but\nthis is not so. In both cases, the r = constant slices are themselves infinitely large [AdS4\nfor Karch and Randall, Minkowski space here] and they all intersect \"at infinity\" in such\na way that the boundary is in fact connected. Notice that, again as in the Karch-Randall\ncase, the function A satisfies A\u2032\u2032 > 0; this is clear from equation 15. However, in the\nKarch-Randall case this was due to the negative cosmological constant on the brane -\nthat is, it was ultimately due to the fact that the Weak Energy Condition [WEC] is\nviolated both on the brane and in the bulk. Here it is due simply to the fact that we\nare violating the NEC instead of the WEC. In fact, if the conjectural identification of\nthe c-function given in [56] is correct, then the AdS/CFT interpretation of NEC-violating\nmatter in the bulk is precisely that the c-function of the CFT on the boundary should\nevolve in just the opposite way to the usual. Naturally, as is pointed out in [56], exotic\nmatter in the bulk should correspond to exotic behaviour of the CFT on the boundary.\nNow, following Karch and Randall, we set up a braneworld at a specific negative value\nof r, namely r = \u2212c, where c is positive. We cut away all smaller values of r and reflect\naround the cut point. [Henceforth, however, we shall ignore the other half of the bulk.]\nExactly as for Karch and Randall, we have a warp factor which decreases until r = 0\nis reached, where it \"bounces\" and then increases towards infinity. The region of the\nbulk corresponding to any given finite region on the brane evidently has infinite volume.\nAs was mentioned earlier, it is not entirely obvious that infinite volume implies infinite\nentropy, so we shall give a rough argument that there is indeed cause for concern here.\nFollowing Flanagan et al [58], we shall suppose that the entropy in a region of the bulk is\nroughly related to the amount of matter [measured by a suitable integral of |Tab k a k b |] it\ncontains. From equations 24 and 25 we see that the relevant integral is\n3A\u03b2\n16\u03c0L2\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212c\n\n6\n\u03b2r\n)dr\ncosh( \u03b2 \u22122) ( 2L\n,\n6\ncosh( \u03b2 ) ( \u03b2c )\n\n(26)\n\n2L\n\nwhere A is the three-dimensional \"area\" of some region on the brane. This is actually\nfinite for \u03b2 between 3 and 4, so we see that infinite volume does not necessarily imply\nan infinite amount of matter. However, realistic values of \u03b2 are no larger than about\n10\n\n\funity, so in the case of real interest to us it would indeed be disastrous if a lightsheet ever\nextended infinitely far into the bulk. We must show that this cannot happen.\nThe study of the lightsheets associated with the braneworld is very much simplified\nby the following simple observation. The metric given by equation 24 may be written as\ng(NECV ) = 4(2/\u03b2) cosh(4/\u03b2) (\n\n\u03b2r\n)[ds \u2297 ds + \u03b7ij dxi \u2297 dxj ],\n2L\n\n(27)\n\nwhere s is a new coordinate defined by\n\u03b2r\ndr\n= 4(1/\u03b2) cosh(2/\u03b2) ( ).\nds\n2L\n\n(28)\n\nEvidently the metric is conformally flat. The equation governing the evolution of the\nshear away from the brane [see [52], page 223],\nk a \u2207a \u03c3bc = \u2212\u03b8\u03c3bc + hdb hec Cjf eg k f k g ,\n\n(29)\n\nwhere hab is the projection operator and Cabcd is the Weyl tensor, shows that if the shear\nvanishes on the brane, then it will vanish everywhere in the bulk. So we can ignore the\nshear term in the Raychaudhuri equation henceforth.\nWe now choose two null vectors, k a and la , perpendicular to the brane slice r = \u2212c,\nt = 0. We take\nk t = 4(\u22121/\u03b2) sech(2/\u03b2) (\n\n\u03b2r\n), k r = +1, k x = k y = k z = 0\n2L\n\n(30)\n\nand\n\n\u03b2r\n), lr = \u22121, lx = ly = lz = 0.\n(31)\n2L\nHere k a corresponds to a ray of light moving into the bulk in the positive r direction.\nClearly k a la = \u22122, and the projection operator is\nlt = 4(\u22121/\u03b2) sech(2/\u03b2) (\n\nhab = diag( 0, 0, 1, 1, 1 ).\n\n(32)\n\nThe null extrinsic curvature on the brane is then\n\u03b2c\n\u22121\ntanh( )hab ,\nL\n2L\n\n(33)\n\n\u03b2c\n\u22123\ntanh( ).\nL\n2L\n\n(34)\n\nds \u2297 ds + \u03b7ij dxi \u2297 dxj\n\n(35)\n\nKba =\nand the expansion at the brane is\n\n\u03b8(\u2212c) =\nNow the flat metric\n\nis obtained from g(NECV ), as given by equation 27, by means of the conformal transformation with conformal factor \u03a9 given by\n\u03a92 = 4(\u22122/\u03b2) sech(4/\u03b2) (\n11\n\n\u03b2r\n).\n2L\n\n(36)\n\n\fTherefore the canonical parameter \u03bb\u0303 for null geodesics of the flat metric is obtained [see\n[52], page 446] from the canonical parameter for null geodesics of g(NECV ) by means of\nthe simple formula\n\u03b2r\nd\u03bb\u0303 = 4(\u22122/\u03b2) sech(4/\u03b2) ( )d\u03bb.\n(37)\n2L\nBut since the metric 35 is flat, its null geodesics satisfy ds/d\u03bb\u0303 = constant = C \u2217 .

The initial condition is given by equation 34. Bear in mind that,\nfrom equation 24, r has a direct metric significance: it measures distances into the bulk\nfrom the brane.\nDespite the simplicity of its form, equation 42 cannot be solved exactly; a numerical\ninvestigation is needed. Extensive trials reveal that the graphs of \u03b8 as a function of r are\nalways of two types, depending on the position of the brane [that is, the value of c.] The\ninitial value of the slope of \u03b8(r) is given, from equations 34 and 42, by\n3\u03b2\n2\nd\u03b8\n2 \u03b2c\n(\u2212c) =\n[1\n\u2212\n(1\n+\n)tanh\n( )].\ndr\n2L2\n\u03b2\n2L\n\n(43)\n\nAs one might expect, when the brane is relatively far from the throat [where, it will\nbe remembered, the NEC-violating matter is most concentrated], then the expansion\ninitially decreases; however, as a ray encounters more of the NEC-violating matter near\nto the throat, the expansion can begin to increase, or, if c is large, remain almost constant\nfor a while. Beyond the throat, however, it declines again, and the result is a caustic: the\nNEC-violating matter is unable to prevent this in this case. A graph of a typical example\nof \u03b8(r) is given in Figure 1; notice that c has been chosen to be substantially larger than\n12\n\n\f\u22121.8\n\n\u22122\n\n\u22122.2\n\n\u22122.4\n\n\u22122.6\n\n\u22122.8\n\n\u22123\n\n\u22123.2\n\n\u22123.4\n\n\u22123.6\n\n\u22123.8\n\u22121.5\n\n\u22121\n\n\u22120.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\nFigure 1: \u03b8(r) with \u03b2 = L = 1, c = 1.5\nL, which is what we mean by the brane being \"relatively far\" from the throat. The value\nchosen for \u03b2, namely unity, corresponds by equation 18 to w = \u22124/3, a value compatible\nwith the observational data [44] and also chosen as an illustrative value by Frampton [11]\nand by Dabrowski et al [35][36].\nHowever, when the brane is relatively near to the throat, \u03b8(r) immediately rises and\nreaches zero; it continues to increase for a while beyond the throat, before decreasing\nand tending asymptotically to zero from above. A typical example is shown in Figure 2,\nbelow: here c < L.\nIn both cases, the lightsheet terminates at a finite value of r, that is, at a finite distance\nfrom the braneworld. In no case does the lightsheet extend infinitely far into the bulk.\nIt would appear, then, that the NEC is [in this special case] not needed to ensure the\nfiniteness of the entropy; the entropy on all lightsheets is finite, even though the NEC\nis violated everywhere in the bulk. The obvious next question is: is the entropy bound\nsatisfied? However, now that we have established that the \"holographic domain\" [see\nbelow] of our brane is in fact always finite, another, even more basic question arises. We\nhave to check that a holographic formulation of this situation is internally consistent.\n\n4. The Bousso-Randall Consistency Condition\nIf we consider the case illustrated in Figure 1, we see that there is a brane at r = \u22121.5,\nand a caustic on the other side of the throat, at about r = 2.2. Let us call this value b.\nThe region corresponding to values of r between the brane and the caustic is called [51]\nthe holographic domain of the brane: it is the part of the bulk which is related to the\n13\n\n\f1.5\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n\u22120.5\n\n\u22121\n\n\u22121.5\n\u22121\n\n\u22120.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\nFigure 2: \u03b8(r) with \u03b2 = L = 1, c = 0.8\nbrane by holography. [In situations like the one corresponding to Figure 2, b is defined as\nthe value of r where \u03b8 = 0.] The region beyond the caustic [or the region where \u03b8 = 0]\nis irrelevant to the brane. This led Bousso and Randall to construct a very simple yet\nstringent consistency check: they point out that this picture of holography can only really\nmake sense if the brane holographic image of a bulk particle \"disappears\" when the bulk\nparticle leaves the holographic domain. They gave a very elegant demonstration that, in\nthe case of the Karch-Randall brane, the holographic image moves out to the conformal\ninfinity of the AdS4 brane precisely when the particle reaches the distance of the caustic\n[slightly beyond the throat] from the brane. Thus the Karch-Randall model passes the\nconsistency check.\nThe consistency check uses the concept of \"causal diamonds\", which is explained very\nclearly in [51]; we refer the reader there for the details. Let P be a point in the bulk\nof our NEC-violating spacetime, located at r = r(P ), and let q be a point on the brane\nwhich is reached by a ray of light from P . We think of q as the tip of a five-dimensional\ncausal diamond, the intersection of which with the brane should give a four-dimensional\ncausal diamond. The event P should correspond to a CFT excitation on the brane having\nsupport on the boundary of the four-dimensional causal diamond. Using equation 24, we\nhave, along the null geodesic joining P to q,\n(dr)2 \u2212 4(2/\u03b2) cosh(4/\u03b2) (\n\n\u03b2r\n) (dt)2 = 0.\n2L\n\n(44)\n\nThe holographic image of P is a thin shell on the brane, of radius given by the distance\nlight can cover in the time taken by the light to travel from P to q. Since the geometry\n14\n\n\fof the brane is Minkowskian, this radius is simply given by integrating dt from equation\n44 [while correcting for the fact that the Minkowski coordinates on the brane do not give\nproper times and distances according to the metric 24]:\nR(P ) = cosh(2/\u03b2) (\n\n\u03b2c\n)\n2L\n\nZ\n\nr(P )\n\n\u2212c\n\nsech(2/\u03b2) (\n\n\u03b2r\n) dr.\n2L\n\n(45)\n\nBousso and Randall show that the corresponding formula for R(P ) in the Karch-Randall\ncase diverges precisely when r(P ) reaches b, the value of r at the edge of the holographic\ndomain. This is the \"evanescence of the CFT shell\" as the bulk particle leaves the\nholographic domain of the brane. But here, if P moves to the edge, we have\nR(Pedge ) = cosh(2/\u03b2) (\n\n\u03b2c\n)\n2L\n\nZ\n\nb\n\n\u2212c\n\nsech(2/\u03b2) (\n\n\u03b2r\n) dr.\n2L\n\n(46)\n\nand this is always finite. Thus, as the bulk particle moves far beyond the holographic\ndomain of the brane, its \"CFT shell\" is still very much present on the brane; it shows no\nsign of disappearing off to the conformal infinity of Minkowski space. To put it another\nway: one would expect a CFT shell that moves off to Minkowski conformal infinity to\ncorrespond to a particle moving beyond a horizon in the bulk, as happens for AdS5 when\nit is foliated by Minkowski slices [in the familiar Poincar\u00e9 coordinates]. But here we have\nno bulk horizon. In fact, no matter how far into the bulk the particle penetrates, the\nradius of the CFT shell can never exceed\n(2/\u03b2)\n\nRmax = cosh\n\n\u03b2c Z \u221e\n\u03b2r\n( )\nsech(2/\u03b2) ( ) dr,\n2L \u2212c\n2L\n\n(47)\n\nwhich is finite; for the parameter values given in Figure 1, Rmax is approximately 5.48.\nA CFT shell of greater radius than this simply has no bulk counterpart, surely as direct a\ncontradiction of holography as one could hope to find.\nBousso and Randall also investigated the fate of a particle which moves beyond the\nholographic domain of the Karch-Randall brane. They found that shortly before the CFT\nshell leaves the braneworld, a second CFT shell appears on the surviving half of the AdS5\nboundary, so the particle already has this CFT shell at infinity when it loses its original\nCFT shell. [The particle thus briefly has two CFT shells, a curious fact with no obvious\ninterpretation.] The holographic domain of the \"brane at infinity\", that is, the surviving\nhalf of the AdS5 boundary, is just the corresponding half of the AdS5 bulk. In the present\ncase, the situation is quite different: numerical experimentation strongly suggests that if\nwe push the brane out towards r = \u2212\u221e, then its holographic domain protrudes farther\ninto the region r \u2265 0, so that b tends to infinity. See for example Figure 3, below, where\nthe brane is at r = \u221230 and b is approximately 23.5. [It seems that, for large values of c,\nb is always somewhat smaller than c but of the same order of magnitude.]\nThus, the holographic domain of a braneworld pushed out to r = \u2212\u221e is the entire\nbulk. Again, however, there are CFT shells at r = \u2212\u221e with no bulk counterpart. To see\nthis, recall that there is no metric on this \"brane\", only a conformal structure. Choose\n\u03b7ij dxi \u2297dxj as a representative of this conformal structure, and let u be the corresponding\nradial coordinate (x2 + y 2 + z 2 )1/2 . [The reader should think of u as nothing more than\na coordinate which distinguishes points on the boundary but which has no meaning as a\n15\n\n\f0\n\n\u2212500\n\n\u22121000\n\n\u22121500\n\n\u22122000\n\n\u22122500\n\n\u22123000\n\n\u22123500\n\n\u22124000\n\n\u22124500\n\u221230\n\n\u221220\n\n\u221210\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\nFigure 3: \u03b8(r) with \u03b2 = L = 1, c = 30\n\"radius\".] The value of this coordinate for the CFT shell of a particle at r = r(P ) is just\nu(P ) =\n\nZ\n\nr(P )\n\nsech(2/\u03b2) (\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u03b2r\n) dr,\n2L\n\n(48)\n\nand again this is strictly finite, even if r(P ) tends to infinity. Again, no CFT shell at\nR\u221e\n\u03b2r\nr = \u2212\u221e which corresponds to values of u greater than \u2212\u221e\nsech(2/\u03b2) ( 2L\n) dr has any bulk\ncounterpart. Of course all this applies equally to the \"brane\" at r = +\u221e, and so we\nobtain a picture of the \"global holography\" [51] of this spacetime as follows. Any particle\nanywhere in the bulk is always associated with two CFT shells, one on the braneworld, and\none at r = +\u221e. The particle is always in the holographic domain of r = +\u221e, but it can\nleave the holographic domain of the braneworld; however, nothing in particular happens\nto the CFT shells when this occurs. No CFT shell ever approaches the boundary of either\nthe brane at r = \u2212c or the one at r = +\u221e, and there are \"infinitely large\" regions of both\nbranes which have no bulk counterpart. Certainly no CFT shell ever crosses from one\nbrane to the other, as happens in the Karch-Randall case: the two branes are disconnected\nin this sense.\nIn short, we can say that this spacetime is profoundly \"anti-holographic\". A particle\nnot in the holographic domain of the braneworld, which contributes nothing to the entropy\non the brane lightsheets, is nevertheless detected by the CFT on the brane. On the other\nhand, there are infinitely many CFT shells, both on the braneworld and at r = +\u221e, which\ncorrespond to nothing whatever in the bulk. If holography is correct, these are simply\ninternal inconsistencies. Holography completely forbids a situation like this to arise.\n\n16\n\n\f5. Conclusion\nIt is difficult to over-state the importance of the cosmological NEC. If indeed w < \u22121, then\nwe may have to adapt ourselves to thinking of the Universe as an intrinsically unstable\nsystem, just as an earlier generation had to learn to think of the Universe as being dynamic\nrather than static. Furthermore, it is not easy to reconcile a violation of the NEC with\nbasic physical principles: if w < \u22121, then matter on the largest scales is governed by\nradically new physics [9]. The fate of the entire Universe could be controlled by quantumgravitational effects acting not in the deep past, but in the here and now [59]. The\nUniverse may be fated to end, not in a Crunch but in a Smash [9][6] [that is, a final\nsingularity in which the cosmological scale factor tends to infinity in a finite proper time.]\nAlternatively, it may be [43] that the Universe does not violate the NEC. If so, the fact\nremains [44] that it comes perilously close to doing so, and it is essential to understand\nwhat prevents values of w close to \u22121 from becoming values slightly less than \u22121. It\nmay seem a great extrapolation to conclude from the example studied here that it is\nholography that plays this role. However, we wish to draw attention not just to the fact\nthat holography forbids violations of the NEC in this particular example, but also to\nthe way in which the prohibition is expressed. Holography, in this example, does not\njust predict something strange when NEC-violating matter is introduced into AdS5 : in\nfact, it fails to predict anything at all; it becomes completely incoherent; it claims both\nthat the brane is aware of an excitation beyond the edge of the lightsheet, and that it\nis not. It may help to compare this with classical General Relativity. If we introduce\nunusual forms of matter into Minkowski space, then the theory may predict very strange\nspacetime structure. But if we tried to claim that we had introduced into Minkowski\nspace a form of matter which is not locally conserved, then General Relativity tells us\nnothing, because of the Bianchi identities. The situation that results when NEC-violating\nmatter is introduced into AdS5 is similar.\nThis suggests to us that holography forbids all violations of the cosmological version\nof the NEC. [Note that it was pointed out in [60] that the entropy bound can be used to\nreplace energy conditions in cosmology. The present claim may be regarded as an attempt\nto explain that observation.] To prove this, one would have to consider NEC-violating\nmatter with a general equation of state: that is, one would have to allow w to depend\non position. Further work is needed on this problem, but it seems implausible that this\nwill materially change our conclusions. It is hard to believe that tinkering with w will\ncause Rmax [given by equation 47] to become infinite, as it must if all CFT shells on the\nbraneworld are to have holographic partners. Intuitively, the conflict with holography\narises from the tendency of NEC-violating spacetimes to \"flare out\" in the manner of a\nwormhole [3], and we therefore expect the pathologies we have seen in this example to\npersist for any NEC-violating bulk. If this is so, then astrophysical analyses of the value\nof w are direct observational tests of holography, which apparently predicts that w \u2265 \u22121.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe author is grateful to Dr Lin Ping for help with the numerical analysis of equation 42,\nand to Soon Wanmei for helpful discussions.\n17\n\n\fReferences\n[1] Raphael Bousso, A Covariant Entropy Conjecture, JHEP 9907 (1999) 004, arXiv:hepth/9905177\n[2] Raphael Bousso, The Holographic Principle, Rev.Mod.Phys. 74 (2002) 825,\narXiv:hep-th/0203101\n[3] M.
