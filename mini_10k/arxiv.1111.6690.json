The standard\nseesaw mechanism, however, does not address the apparent lack of hierarchy in the\nneutrino masses compared to the quarks and charged leptons, nor the large leptonic\nmixing angles compared to the small angles of the CKM matrix.

If large\nnumbers of gauge singlet fermions are present at high energies \u2013 as is suggested, for\nexample, by various string constructions \u2013 then the effective low energy neutrino\nmass matrix may be determined as a sum over many distinct Yukawa couplings, with\nthe largest ones being the most important.

The scenario leads to predictions of a normal hierarchy for the neutrino\nmasses, and a value for the |mee | mass matrix element of about 1 \u2212 6 meV.\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe quark and lepton masses and mixing angles provide one of the fundamental mysteries\nof the standard model of particle physics. They hint at a potentially deep underlying\nstructure, while also seeming sufficiently random so as to defy straightforward explanation.\nThere are a number of qualitative features of these parameters which one would like to\nunderstand:1\n1. Why are the neutrino masses roughly ten orders of magnitude smaller than the\nmasses of the quarks and charged leptons?\n2. Why do the quark and charged lepton masses have significant hierarchies of about\nfive orders of magnitude?\n3. Why is the CKM matrix approximately equal to the identity when the up and down\nquarks are both ordered by mass?\n4. Why are the mixing angles in the lepton sector fundamentally different from those\nin the quark sector, with two angles close to maximal?\nOf these questions, it is the first which has lent itself most easily to explanation. The\nkey observation is that right-handed neutrinos, unlike any of the other standard model\nfermions, have no known gauge interactions. As a result, no symmetry forbids them from\nobtaining Majorana masses, which may be many orders of magnitude larger than the\nweak scale. After integrating out the right-handed neutrinos from the theory, one obtains\neffective operators of the form (HL)2 /MR , where H is the Higgs field, L is a lepton doublet,\nand MR is the right-handed neutrino mass scale. This yields light Majorana neutrinos with\nmasses of order v 2 /MR , with v = 174 GeV being the Higgs vacuum expectation value, and\nwith a possible additional suppression from Yukawa couplings [1]. Appropriately small\nmasses are then obtained for M of order 1014 \u2212 1016 GeV, perhaps related to the scale\nof grand unification. This picture is so simple that it is now taken almost for granted,\nalthough it should be kept in mind that experimental confirmation is still lacking.\n1\n\nThe strong CP problem may or may not have a solution related to the other flavor mysteries, and\nwe will not concern ourselves with it in this paper. We may rely, for example, on a separate solution\ninvolving an invisible axion with a large Peccei-Quinn symmetry breaking scale.\n\n2\n\n\fThe remaining questions on our list, on the other hand, have no such obvious interpretations, although a large variety of proposals have certainly been put forth. In many\nmodels, one assumes that the quarks and leptons are charged under a variety of possible flavor symmetries, with the Yukawa couplings proportional to appropriate powers of\nsymmetry breaking spurions. While such models can produce successful phenomenology,\nthe choices for the flavor symmetry transformations, as well as the associated spurion\nstructures, can seem ad hoc, and it is perhaps fair to say that no particular model stands\nout as being especially compelling.\nAnother possibility, which runs somewhat counter to the flavor symmetry perspective,\nis that the various Yukawa couplings are determined in some more complicated way by the\nfundamental theory, with their low energy values not representing any essential pattern. In\nthis scenario, one simply parametrizes the Yukawa couplings via a hypothesized statistical\ndistribution, and checks the phenomenological consequences. Such distributions may\narise, for example, via the landscape of string theory, or may perhaps be manifestations\nof our own ignorance of the fundamental theory. At the very least, the extent to which\nsuch an approach is viable is an important issue for determining the merit of the flavor\nsymmetry paradigm. Fortunately, the standard model contains a large number of Yukawa\ncouplings, and these may then serve as a reasonable statistical sample from which to draw\nproposals for the Yukawa distributions. A key issue with this approach, however, comes\nfrom question number (4), above. Naively, it seems difficult to allow for a single form\nof probability distribution to describe all of the standard model Yukawa couplings. The\nquarks and charged leptons seem to prefer a probability distribution which scans roughly\nevenly over many orders of magnitude in order to yield large mass hierarchies and the\nsmall CKM mixing angles [2]. The neutrinos, on the other hand, would seem to prefer a\nmore degenerate \u2013 or \"anarchical\" type of scan in order to obtain the required large mixing\nangles [3, 4, 5]. While we currently have no way to derive these probability distributions\nfrom fundamental theory, and it is certainly possible that the neutrino Yukawas are simply\ndetermined in a special way, different from the other fermions, a unified description would\nseem more attractive, and would perhaps lend more weight to this approach.\nIn this paper we will show that the seesaw mechanism alone may be what is distinguishing the neutrinos from the other fermions, both in terms of their masses, and also in\n\n3\n\n\fterms of their large mixing angles. In particular, we will show that it is indeed possible to\nmake use of the same general form of distribution for all of the Yukawa couplings of the\nstandard model, and still produce appropriate phenomenology. We will consider scans\nwith large hierarchies, which seem naively most suited to the quarks and charged leptons.\nAs in the standard seesaw, for the neutrinos we shall take advantage of the fundamental\nphysical feature which distinguishes them from the other fermions; the fact that the righthanded neutrinos are gauge singlets. As a result, not only do the right-handed neutrinos\nhave the possibility for large Majorana masses, but moreover, due to the absence of any\nanomaly cancellation requirements, we do not know how many of them there are. Indeed, constructions in string theory often produce large numbers of singlet fermions with\nMajorana masses close to the GUT scale after the compactification of extra dimensions\n[6, 7, 8].2\nIn the presence of a large number of singlets, the low energy neutrino mass matrix will\nbe realized as a sum over many distinct hierarchical numbers with the largest Yukawa\ncouplings dominating. This generically results in a washed out hierarchy, and potentially\nlarge mixing angles. It follows that a random hierarchical scan of Yukawa couplings is in\nfact a good fit for the observed masses and mixing angles of the standard model, so long\nas the possibility for a large number of right-handed neutrinos is taken into account.\nThe reason that many singlet states often arise with masses close to the GUT scale\nin string constructions is actually reasonably generic: After compactifying d extra dimensions in a string model, the resulting Kaluza Klein mass scale is related to the effective\nfour-dimensional Planck scale MPl through the relation\n\u0012\n\u0013 d +1\nMKK 2\nMKK \u223c MPl\n,\nMs\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Ms is the string scale. In order for the compactification geometry to be reasonably\ndescribed by a classical gravity picture, it is required that MKK be at least parametrically smaller than Ms . From the above relation, and considering the 6 available extra\ndimensions of string theory, we thus see that it may be reasonable to expect the Kaluza\nKlein scale to be roughly a few orders of magnitude smaller than MPl .3 Note that it is\n2\n\nFor more general field theory discussions, see also [9, 10].\nIt is not necessarily required, however, that the compactification of the extra dimensions have a well\ndefined classical gravity description. This is perhaps the main caveat to the present argument.\n3\n\n4\n\n\falso possible that grand unified symmetry is broken via a mechanism directly related to\nthe compactified extra dimensions, further motivating the presence of the KK scale at\nclose to 1014 \u2212 1016 GeV. In any case, the point then is that the KK scale is a natural\nscale for the appearance of a large number of gauge singlets which may then serve as\nright-handed neutrinos; these singlets might be born out of KK towers themselves, as was\nthe case considered in [7], or they might be associated with moduli fields, stabilized by\nmasses close to MKK due to fluxes in the compactified dimensions [8].4 For our purposes,\nthe main point is that the number of relevant singlets with masses close to the needed\nseesaw scale may easily number in the tens or hundreds. Note that we will not attempt to\nconstruct an explicit top-down model for Yukawa couplings in this paper, but will simply\ntake a phenomenological point of view based on the known properties of the standard\nmodel masses and mixing angles. We will leave top-down model building as a possible\nsubject for future work.\nThe outline of our paper is as follows: In section 2 we will describe our framework in\nmore detail, discussing the various qualitative features we require, including the properties\nof the high energy Majorana mass matrix. In section 3, we will give an example of a\nparticular universal Yukawa coupling distribution which gives a good phenomenological\nfit for the charged fermion masses and mixings, and show how our mechanism then also\nleads to good phenomenology in the neutrino sector. Additionally, we will show that our\nsetup leads to the predictions of a normal hierarchy for the neutrino masses, and a value\nof |mee | \u2013 the neutrino mass parameter relevant for neutrinoless double beta decay \u2013 of\nbetween about 1 and 6 meV. We will summarize and discuss future directions in section\n4.\n\n2\n\nFramework\n\nThe reason that many right-handed neutrinos, which we shall denote generically as \u03bdR0 s,\ncan wash out hierarchy in the low energy neutrino mass matrix m is simple. This matrix\n4\n\n3\nIn this latter case note that the singlet masses are actually given by \u223c MKK\n/Ms2 , with a further\nsmall suppression below the KK scale.\n\n5\n\n\ftakes the form\nmij = v 2\n\nX\n\nYik Mkl\u22121 Yjl ,\n\n(2)\n\nlk\n\nwhere, with N right-handed neutrinos, Y is the 3 \u00d7 N Yukawa matrix, M is the N \u00d7 N\nMajorana mass matrix, and v is the Higgs vacuum expectation value. Taking the typical\nlargest Yukawa coupling size to be of order one, for example, we can see that, with\nsufficiently many \u03bdR 's, each matrix element in m will generically obtain some number of\nlarge contributions. Even if the original Yukawas were hierarchical, the mij 's then come\nout to be roughly of the same order, with the hierarchy having been lost (note that,\nassuming arbitrary signs or phases for each term in the sum, one obtains an enhancement\n\u221a\nto the overall scale of m by a factor which scales as N ).\nThe mechanism we are discussing here is fairly general, and a specific structure or\ndistribution for the Yukawa couplings and Majorana masses is not necessary. We do,\nhowever require the following conditions to be satisfied:\n\u2022 There must be a reasonably well defined upper-bound to the neutrino Yukawa couplings. Such an upper-bound could be set by perturbativity or by some other fundamental physics, and should be reasonably independent of which neutrino field a\ngiven Yukawa coupling is associated with.\n\u2022 Enough right-handed neutrinos must be present so that each left-handed neutrino is\nexpected to have >\n\u223c 1 Yukawa couplings within a factor of a few of the upper bound.\nIt can be seen by inspection of equation 2 that this would result in each low energy\nneutrino mass matrix element expecting to receive at least one \"large\" contribution.\nIf the Majorana mass matrix has hierarchical eigenvalues, then this condition applies\nto the lightest set of the \u03bdR 's, which will give the dominant contribution to the seesaw.\nAmongst the standard model quarks and charged leptons, we have one order one\nYukawa coupling amongst 27 (associated with the top quark), and so with this as\na guide, we anticipate that we may require roughly >\n\u223c 30 right handed-neutrinos for\nour mechanism to work.\n\u2022 We require a Majorana mass matrix which mixes together the right-handed neutrino\nfields. One simple way this might be realized is if the physics determining the\nMajorana masses is distinct from that determining the Yukawa couplings (in which\n\n6\n\n\fcase the unitary matrix which diagonalizes the Majorana masses can be taken to be\ndistributed according to the Haar measure, as will be discussed in section 3), but\nessentially any sufficiently non-diagonal structure should be viable.\nThe need for this last condition can be seen as follows: Suppose that the Majorana mass\nmatrix were diagonal. In that case there would be a tendency for the diagonal elements\nof the low energy mass matrix to be larger than the off-diagonal elements, resulting in\nsmall mixing angles. Let us compare for example the 1, 1 element to the 1, 2 element:\nm11 \u223c\n\nX\n\n\u22121 2\nMkk\nY1k ,\n\n(3)\n\n\u22121\nMkk\nY1k Y2k .\n\n(4)\n\nk\n\nm12 \u223c\n\nX\nk\n\nFor any given Yukawa coupling y, there is in general a much higher chance that y 2 will\nbe near its upper bound, than the chance that two separate couplings y1 and y2 will both\nbe large and lead to a large product y1 y2 . It is thus clear from equations 3 and 4 that a\ndiagonal Majorana mass matrix will tend to give poor phenomenology in our scenario.5\nIt should be clear that we certainly do not require that all of the Yukawa couplings\nof the quarks and leptons share a universal distribution. We will, however, concentrate\non such distributions in this work, since in this way we may check that it is actually the\nmany \u03bdR 's which are resulting in large mixing angles, rather than any fundamental lack\nof hierarchy assumed for the neutrino Yukawa couplings. Note that for this reason, there\nis no intrinsic obstacle to realizing our scenario in a supersymmetric context (in which\ntan \u03b2 would modify the hypothetical quark and charged lepton distributions somewhat),\nor even in the context of a grand unified theory.\nNote that a wave-function overlap picture (see e.g. [7, 8, 11, 12]) for obtaining hierarchy\nin the Yukawa couplings would not work very well for our scenario, since in such cases\nthe couplings for a given field tend to all be correlated in size. This is the key manner in\nwhich our scenario with many right-handed neutrinos differs from those already appearing\nin the literature. Constructions with compactified extra-dimensions may still be used\n5\n\nNote that, even with a Majorana mass matrix with substantial off-diagonal components, squared\nYukawa couplings will still only contribute to the diagonal elements of mij . With many right-handed\nneutrinos, however, the large number of terms (of order N 2 ) which are products of separate Yukawa\ncouplings actually give the dominant contribution.\n\n7\n\n\fto motivate the presence of the many \u03bdR states near the GUT scale, but we require,\nfor example, extra-dimensional wave function profiles to be fairly flat, with the Yukawa\nhierarchy generated by fundamental physics in some other manner.\nIn the next section we will show our mechanism at work quantitatively in a specific\nexample: We will take a Yukawa coupling distribution fit to the known properties of\nthe quarks and charged leptons, and work out the phenomenological consequences as a\nfunction of the number of \u03bdR 's. We will also show that our scenario (as well as any\nscenario with a roughly anarchical low energy neutrino mass matrix) leads to a prediction\nof |mee | \u223c 1 \u2212 6 meV.\n\n3\n\nAn Example\n\nFitting to the charged fermion masses and CKM angles\nWithout knowledge of the high-scale theory it is of course impossible to know the fundamental distribution of the Yukawa couplings. However, existing data can serve as a\nguide; the best fitting probability distribution for the charged fermions has been examined in some detail in [2], which we use as a starting point for our study. For power\nlaw distributions with minimum and maximum cutoffs, they found that the quark and\ncharged lepton masses are best fit by a distribution that is very close to scale invariant,\n\u03c1(m) \u223c 1/m. However, we expect that the Yukawa couplings, not the masses, are the\nfundamental parameters of the underlying theory. Because of mixing effects, the form of\nthe Yukawa probability distribution is not directly transferred to the masses. Considering\ndistributions of the form\n\u03c1(y) \u223c\n\n1\ny\u03b4\n\n(5)\n\nat the GUT scale within the standard model, the authors of [2] found that values of \u03b4\njust below 1.2 give the optimal mass distribution, with 1.2 \u00d7 10\u22126 \u2264 y \u2264 1.\nThe Yukawa couplings also determine fermion mixing, so we wish to ensure that our\nchoice of distribution also leads to reasonable values for the CKM elements. In fact,\nthe hierarchical structure considered here naturally leads to small mixing angles. Note\nhowever, that there is a caveat; without any flavor symmetry to correlate the Yukawa\n\n8\n\n\fcouplings of a given field, we must rely on a minor coincidence to ensure that it is actually\nthe mass ordered basis in which the CKM matrix appears approximately diagonal. The\nprobability that this could have occurred by chance is 1/3! \u223c 17%, and we will take this\nas a starting assumption, considering only CKM matrices in which the largest element of\neach row and column lies on the diagonal in the mass ordered basis. For the distribution\nconsidered in [2], with \u03c1(y) \u223c 1/y 1.16 , while it was found that reasonable masses and small\nCKM mixing were obtained, in some cases the observed CKM off-diagonal elements were\nlarger than the mean predicted values, lying on tails of their distributions. This can be\nseen from the plot of the |Vus | distribution in Figure 1.\n8\n1.0\n\nCumulative\n\nProbability Density\n\n0.8\n\n6\n\n0.6\n\n\u2206 =1.3\n\u2206 =1.2\n\u2206 =1.1\n\u2206 =1.0\n\n0.4\n0.2\n\n4\n\n0.0\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n2\n\n0\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n\u00c8V us \u00c8\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n\u221a\nFigure 1: |Vus | for \u03b4 = 1.1 for matrices with mass eigenvalues within a factor of 10 of\nGUT scale values.

As we see in Figure 1, there is a sharp peak at small mixing, so\nto get a measure of how consistent each scenario is with the data, we characterize each\ndistribution by its median as well as the probability of finding a value smaller than the\nexperimentally observed value. We will use the 68% and 95% levels of the latter to define\n1\u03c3 and 2\u03c3 ranges, as in [2]. This is illustrated for |Vus | in Figure 1 (inset), which shows\nsome preference for smaller values of \u03b4 \u2013 smaller \u03b4 leads to larger mixing angles. To get an\noverall measure of the CKM matrix, we consider the three off-diagonal elements shown in\nTable 1. The measured values of |Vus |, |Vub |, and |Vcb |, all show improvement of agreement\nas \u03b4 is decreased, and fall within our 1\u03c3 criterion around \u03b4 = 1.1. We use this, along\nwith the mass only best fit of \u03b4 \u223c 1.2 \u00b1 .1 from [2], in our choice of distribution. While\none could perform a detailed statistical analysis to determine the best fit to all measured\nparameters, the \u03b4 = 1.1 case gives rise to both reasonable charged fermion masses as well\nas CKM angles, so we will take it as our example distribution for studying the neutrino\nsector.\n6\n\nHere and throughout this paper we use charged fermion mass eigenvalues evaluated at the GUT scale\nin the standard model [13], though [2] demonstrated that the best fit for the distribution feels little effect\nfrom the running. The experimental values for the CKM elements we cite do not reflect any running,\nbut this effect is small, no more than \u223c 15%, and is negligible for Vus [14].\n\n10\n\n\fThe Majorana distribution\nFor the high energy Majorana mass matrix, for which we have no guidance from data, we\ntake a simple ansatz in accord with the discussion of section 2; we suppose that the physics\ndetermining the Majorana mass matrix is independent from that determining the Yukawa\ncouplings. This assumption then implies that the unitary matrix U which diagonalizes\nM = U DU T may be taken as distributed according to the Haar measure [4].7 Haar\ndistributed unitary matrices are easily generated via previously established algorithms\n[16]. Note that we must further impose a distribution on the mass eigenvalues appearing\nin the diagonal matrix D; for simplicity we choose the case of a linear distribution between\nzero and MR , the Majorana mass scale, which we fix by requiring that we match the value\nfor the larger measured neutrino mass difference, \u2206m231 .\nProbability for large PMNS mixing angles\nGiven our chosen statistical distributions, we next generate a large number of PMNS\nmatrices for various numbers of right-handed neutrino species between N = 2 and N =\n100. We first generate a 3 \u00d7 N Dirac mass matrix MD = vY , where the entries of the\nYukawa matrix Y scan between 1.2\u00d710\u22126 and 1 with probability density \u03c1(y) \u223c y \u22121.1 and\nhave random phases. We then generate a Haar distributed N \u00d7 N Majorana mass matrix\nwith linearly scanning eigenvalues, to form a neutrino mass matrix m \u2261 MD M \u22121 MDT =\nU\u03bd D\u03bd U\u03bdT , where D\u03bd is a diagonal matrix containing the neutrino mass eigenvalues, and\nU\u03bd is unitary. We generate 3 \u00d7 3 charged lepton matrices Ml with the same distribution\nas the Dirac matrices for neutrinos. To more appropriately model the true charged lepton\n\u221a\nmass matrix, we only take matrices which agree to within a factor of 10 of the GUT\nscale charged lepton masses, as described previously for the quarks. We diagonalize\nMl = Ul Dl Vl\u2020 , from which we can generate the PMNS matrix UP M N S = Ul\u2020 U\u03bd . This\ncan be parameterized, with unphysical phases rotated away, in the standard fashion with\n7\n\nThe Haar measure \u03bc on a group G satisfies \u03bc(gE) = \u03bc(E) for every g \u2208 G, and is uniquely defined\nfor G = U (N ).\n\n11\n\n\fthree mixing angles (\u03b8ij ) and three CP phases (\u03b4, \u03b121 , \u03b131 ),\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nc12 c13\ns12 c13\ns13 e\u2212i\u03b4\ns23 c13 \uf8f8\nUP M N S = \uf8ed \u2212s12 c23 \u2212 c12 s23 s13 ei\u03b4 c12 c23 \u2212 s12 s23 s13 ei\u03b4\ni\u03b4\ni\u03b4\ns12 s23 \u2212 c12 c23 s13 e\n\u2212c12 s23 \u2212 s12 c23 s13 e\nc23 c13\n\u00d7 diag(1, ei\n\n\u03b121\n2\n\n, ei\n\n\u03b131\n2\n\n),\n\n(6)\n(7)\n\nwhere sij = sin(\u03b8ij ) and cij = sin(\u03b8ij ).8 Experimentally, there are two large mixing angles,\nwith a best fit (assuming a normal hierarchy) of sin2 (\u03b812 )BF = 0.312+0.017\n\u22120.015 and maximal\nmixing for sin2 (\u03b823 )BF = 0.52+0.06\n\u22120.07 (1\u03c3)[17].

Even at\nand above the seesaw scale these are expected to be small for the distributions we consider, since we\ntake all of our Yukawa couplings to be smaller than 1, with only a handful approaching this upper\nbound. If the bound on the Yukawas were taken larger, then renormalization group running could have\nimportant, albeit model dependent effects. For example, with low energy supersymmetry, depending on\nthe superpartner spectrum, it is possible for running at the seesaw scale to contribute to slepton mass\nsplittings and flavor changing neutral currents [9]. If only the standard model were assumed valid up\nto energies above the seesaw scale, then it is possible to obtain large radiative corrections to the Higgs\nquartic coupling and thereby large, experimentally excluded, values for the Higgs mass. Note that this\nlatter conclusion would be avoided in the presence of high scale supersymmetry.\n\n12\n\n\fnear maximal mixing angle and one large mixing angle. Because maximal mixing, with\nsin2 (2\u03b8) = 1, is a special point, we look for cases which have at least as much mixing\nas the 1\u03c3 experimental bounds, requiring that one angle satisfies sin2 (2\u03b8) \u2265 0.98 and\nanother satisfies sin2 (2\u03b8) \u2265 0.84. The results are shown in Figure 2, from which we see\na clear indication that as the number of right-handed neutrinos increases, so too does\nthe likelihood of obtaining large mixing angles \u2013 as expected for the reasons laid out in\nSection 2.This effect is further illustrated in Figure 3, where we see the shift to larger\nmixing angles as N increases.\n60\n\n30\n\nN =3\n\n50\n\nN =10\n\n25\n\n40\n\n20\n\n30\n\n15\n\n20\n\n10\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n0\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n14\n12\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\nN =30\n\n0.0\n20\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\nN =100\n\n15\n10\n5\n0\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n0.0\n\nsin2 H 2 \u0398 L\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\nFigure 3: Distribution of mixing angles. The three different bands represent the largest,\nmiddle, and smallest sin2 (2\u03b8).\n\nOther parameters\nWhile the absolute masses of the neutrinos are not well measured, oscillation experiments\ngive us a good measure of their mass squared differences, with a best fit of \u2206m221 =\n\u22125\n\u22123\n7.59+0.20\neV2 and \u2206m231 = 2.50+0.09\neV2 (assuming a normal hierarchy, with\n\u22120.18 \u00d7 10\n\u22120.16 \u00d7 10\n\ncomparable values for an inverted hierarchy) [17]. To see if our construction accommodates\nthis small but non-trivial hierarchy, and to determine whether there is a preference for a\nnormal or inverted structure, in Figure 4 we consider the ratio of neutrino mass squared\ndifferences, which we plot as log10 \u2206m232 /\u2206m221 . Here we label the masses such that\n\n13\n\n\fm3 > m2 > m1 , so that this quantity is positive for a normal hierarchy and negative\nfor an inverted one.9 Observed masses give a value of about \u00b11.5. We see that for\nlarge N , the masses are much less hierarchical, and easily accommodate the observed\nvalues. Furthermore, we see an overwhelming preference for the normal hierarchy, which\nin particular justifies our use of the associated mass and mixing angle measurements in\nlater parts of this section.10\n\nProbability Density\n\n0.5\n\nN =100\n\n0.4\nN = 30\n\n0.3\n\nN =10\n\n0.2\n\nN =3\n\n0.1\n0.0\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\nlog10 I Dm 32\n\u0091\n\n2\n\n4\n\n2\nDm 21\nM\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\nFigure 4: Ratio of mass squared differences log10 \u2206m232 /\u2206m221 for N = 3, 10, 30 and\n100. Here we choose the convention m3 > m2 > m1 , so that positive(negative) values\ncorrespond to a normal (inverted) hierarchy.\n\nHaving seen that the mixing angles and mass splittings observed in nature are increasingly typical as N increases, we wish to look at other properties of viable matrices\nproduced within our framework. To select cases close to reality, we consider only matrices\nwhich satisfy: 0.28 \u2264 sin2 (\u03b812 ) \u2264 0.35; 0.41 \u2264 sin2 (\u03b823 ) \u2264 0.61; 29.1 \u2264 \u2206m231 /\u2206m221 \u2264\n35.6; and 0.004 \u2264 sin2 (\u03b813 ) \u2264 0.028, which come from best fit 2\u03c3 bounds [17]. In Figure\n5, we show the distribution of sin(\u03b813 ), subject to the large angle and mass constraints,\nand find that there is some tension with the best fit, which at 2\u03c3 corresponds to about\n9\n\nNote that for an inverted hierarchy, our labeling is non-standard.\nThe reason our scenario strongly prefers a normal versus an inverted hierarchy is that the reasonably\nlarge observed ratio of solar and atmospheric mass squared differences necessitates that either the heaviest\n(normal hierarchy) or the lightest (inverted hierarchy) of the neutrinos is a mild outlier. Having the\nheaviest neutrino as the outlier in our scenario is much more probable, since this requires fewer outlying\nelements in our typically degenerate mass matrix.\n10\n\n14\n\n\f0.06 \u2264 sin(\u03b813 ) \u2264 0.17. On the other hand, after fitting successfully the other parameters\nof the neutrino mass matrix, the probability of obtaining one mild outlier is not too small.\nThis can be seen on the right side of Figure 5, which gives the fraction of matrices at or\nbelow a given value of sin(\u03b813 ) - there is significant variation across the experimentally\npreferred region (in grey), reaching around 10% near the upper 2\u03c3 bound. Our scenario\nclearly prefers a nonzero value for sin(\u03b813 ), for which there is growing evidence, and a\nsignificant range of allowed values would be unexceptional. The situation for \u03b813 in our\nscenario is ultimately similar to that of neutrino anarchy, for which a global statistical\nanalysis was performed and found good agreement with the data [5]. Performing a similar\nanalysis for the present case is beyond the scope of this work, but we would expect to\nfind similar results.\n2.0\nCumulative Probability\n\nProbability Density\n\n0.14\n1.5\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0.12\n0.10\n0.08\n0.06\n0.04\n0.02\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\nsinH \u039813 L\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n0.00\n\n0.00\n\n0.05\n\nsinH \u039813 L\n0.10\n\n0.15\n\n0.20\n\nFigure 5: Left: sin(\u03b813 ) distributions among matrices satisfying 2\u03c3 large angle and mass\nconstraints described in the text, for N = 30 (blue, solid) and N = 100 (red, dashed).\nRight: The corresponding cumulative probability distribution functions.

We again require one angle with sin2 (2\u03b8) \u2265 0.98 and\nanother with sin2 (2\u03b8) \u2265 0.84.

Case I is the\ndistribution (\u03b4 = 1.1) we have already considered in detail, and is listed for reference.\nCase II demonstrates the importance of the second condition listed in Section 2\u2013\nthat enough right-handed neutrinos must be present so that each left-handed neutrino\n\n17\n\n\fI\nII\nIII\nIV\nV\n\n\u03b4\n1.1\n1.3\n0.9\n0.9\n1.1\n\nN = 3 N = 30 N = 100 N = 200\n2.5\n10.1\n17.0\n19.0\n2.5\n3.2\n6.7\n10.8\n5.3\n17.6\n20.2\n20.9\n3.7\n16.3\n19.7\n20.5\n3.1\n6.8\n15.4\n18.4\n\nP100 (\u03b813 )\n6\n11\n5\n5\n7\n\nComments\n\nNo minimum cutoff\nHierarchical Majorana\n\nTable 2: Percent of events with sin2 (2\u03b8)largest \u2265 0.98 and sin2 (2\u03b8)next largest \u2265 0.84 for\ndifferent distributions and numbers of right-handed neutrinos, as described in the text.\nAlso shown (denoted P100 (\u03b813 )): for matrices satisfying 2\u03c3 constraints for \u03b812 , \u03b823 , and\nthe squared mass difference ratio, the percentage which also satisfy the 2\u03c3 bounds on \u03b813 ,\nwith N = 100.\nis expected to have >\n\u223c 1 Yukawa couplings within a factor of a few of the upper bound.\nHere, the distribution steeply favors the low end of the spectrum (\u03b4 = 1.3), which makes\nsampling of the upper cutoff much rarer; as a result, many more right-handed neutrinos\nare needed to wash out the hierarchy. Whereas there is a clear enhancement by N = 30\nfor \u03b4 = 1.1, the rise in likelihood of large angles does not occur until much larger N in this\ncase. Because the steeper distribution favors smaller mixing angles for a given number of\nright-handed neutrinos, this case performs somewhat better than the others for the \u03b813\ndistribution.\nIn case III, we see a distribution logarithmically skewed towards larger couplings (\u03b4 =\n0.9). This makes our large N effect much more dramatic, becoming noticeable for smaller\nvalues of N . Additionally, because this distribution is well behaved all the way to zero,\nit is not necessary to impose a lower bound on the Yukawa couplings for this value of \u03b4,\nso we remove this requirement for case IV. Because only values close to the top of the\ndistribution are important at large N , this only has the small impact of removing a bit of\nprobability from the top. The change is more apparent at small values of N , where the\nlower parts of the distribution can be relevant in viable matrices.\nFinally, we turn to the choice of distribution for the Majorana mass matrix, which\nwe have previously been taking to be anarchical and basis independent. In case V we\ntake a very different approach, choosing the same hierarchical distribution (\u03b4 = 1.1) and\ncutoff structure for both Dirac and Majorana mass matrix elements. While this appears\n\n18\n\n\fto suppress washout effects somewhat, the impact is fairly weak, as the hierarchy is\nlargely lost in the inversion of the Majorana matrix; only a small relative suppression of\nprobability remains at N = 100.\nFrom these scenarios we see that while the quantitative behavior varies somewhat, the\nqualitative effect of increased probability of large mixing angles from many right-handed\nneutrinos applies broadly in the class of distributions we have laid out. Furthermore,\nwe see that while there is some tension with a small value of sin(\u03b813 ), all cases have a\nsignificant amount of probability lying in the experimentally favored region.\n\n4\n\nDiscussions and Conclusions\n\nIn this work we have shown that the origin of the unique flavor properties of the neutrinos\n\u2013 small masses, and large mixing angles \u2013 may both have their origin in the seesaw\nmechanism. Even if the neutrino Yukawa couplings have large hierarchies, as are observed\nfor the charged fermions, the hierarchical structure may generically become washed out if\nthe seesaw involves a large number of right handed neutrinos, numbering perhaps in the\ntens or hundreds. We have given an explicit example showing the mechanism at work,\nwith a statistical distribution of Yukawa couplings of a roughly scale invariant form, fit\nto the properties of the quarks and charged leptons. After integrating out the righthanded neutrinos, the probability of obtaining a mixing angle as large as the observed\nnear-maximal value of \u03b823 , along with a second angle as large as the observed value of\n\u03b812 was found to be about 20%. The mechanism is fairly general, and may work with a\nvariety of Yukawa structures, so long as various conditions are satisfied as described in the\ntext. General predictions of the framework are a normal hierarchy for neutrino masses,\nand a neutrino mass matrix element |mee | of about 1 \u2212 6 meV.\nThere are a variety of possible directions for future work. The first and most obvious\none would be to try to build a top down model yielding hierarchical Yukawa couplings\nof an appropriate nature for our mechanism. This is non-trivial, since the most common\napproaches to producing hierarchical Yukawa couplings \u2013 flavor symmetries and extra\ndimensional wavefunctions \u2013 yield correlations across all of the couplings of a given field\nwhich do not lend themselves well to our framework. It may also be interesting to con-\n\n19\n\n\fsider the issue of leptogenesis [23, 24] in our scenario.12 If the largest neutrino Yukawa\ncouplings are of order one, as in the case of the quarks, then the seesaw scale we require is\nfairly large \u2013 of order 1015 \u2212 1016 GeV. It then follows that washout processes will destroy\nany lepton asymmetry produced by the decays of the right-handed neutrinos. As a result,\nit may be necessary to move away from the thermal leptogenesis paradigm, and construct\na model involving, for example, out of equilibrium inflaton decays to right-handed neutrinos at temperatures much below the seesaw scale [26, 24]. One other possible future\ndirection would be to consider the impact of anthropic selection effects on the types of\nYukawa coupling distributions that we have been working with. One amusing possibility,\nsomewhat orthogonal to the direction we have been pursuing here, is that the fundamental Yukawa distributions for the charged fermions may actually be reasonably degenerate,\nbut with strong anthropic selection effects constraining the first generation quarks and\ncharged leptons [27, 28], and indeed, perhaps even the top quark [29], to be outliers. If this\nwere the case, degenerate neutrino Yukawas might in fact be more representative of the\nfundamental Yukawa distributions than the hierarchical charged fermion ones. It might\nbe interesting to see if this picture could be made to work at a quantitative level using\nsome relatively degenerate ansatz for the Yukawa distributions, and putting anthropic\nconstraints on various charged fermions masses.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank Hitoshi Murayama, Taizan Watari and particularly Tsutomu\nYanagida for useful discussions and input.
