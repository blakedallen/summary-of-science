Knowing his particular interest\nin fundamental problems which has marked his scientific prolific career we are confident he will share our curiosity\nin this subject. We consider a manifold M of the form M = [0, T ] \u00d7 \u03a3, where [0, T ] is a time interval and \u03a3 a\nthree-dimensional manifold with smooth boundaries \u2202\u03a3, see Fig. 1. We want to answer the following question. What\ndata must be given at the initial surface \u03a30 := {0} \u00d7 \u03a3 and the boundary surface T := [0, T ] \u00d7 \u2202\u03a3 such that there\nexists a unique solution (M, g) of Einstein's vacuum field equations which depends continuously on the data? From\nTa\n\n\u2202t\n\nNa\n\nT\n\u03a30\n\nFIG. 1: The geometrical setup for the initial-boundary value formulation.\n\nthe work of Mme Choquet-Bruhat[1] in the fifties we know that at \u03a30 we must give a pair of symmetric tensor fields\n(hab , kab ), the first being positive definite (and so a metric), which obeys the Einstein constraint equations. They\nare called the initial data sets for Einstein's equations. They give a unique solution to Einstein's equations on the\ndomain of dependence D(\u03a30 ) of \u03a30 (which depends on the data given), namely a spacetime (D(\u03a30 ), g), such that\n\u03c8 \u22c6 g = h, \u03c8 \u22c6 Ln g = k, where n denotes the unit normal to \u03a30 in D(\u03a30 ) and \u03c8 : \u03a30 \u2192 D(\u03a30 ) the inclusion map. This\nsolution depends continuously on its initial data. This setting is called the initial value problem. Furthermore, if two\ninitial data sets are related by a diffeomorphism in \u03a30 , then the unique solutions they produce are also related by a\ndiffeomorphism, this time on the maximal development[2] of \u03a30 . We call this property the geometric uniqueness (or\nat least a version of it) of the initial value problem.\nTo show the above assertion is not an easy nor a direct task since Einstein's equations are geometrical and so they\nare subject to the diffeomorphism freedom. First, the field equations need to be recast into a system of evolution\nequations with constraints. Second, a gauge for which the first set of equations is strongly hyperbolic needs to be\nfound. Third, the theory of strongly hyperbolic equations is used in order to show that a unique solution in this\ngauge class exists and depends continuously on the initial data. Finally, geometric uniqueness must be shown. This\nprogram was first accomplished using harmonic coordinates.[1, 2]\n\n\u2217\n\nFaMAF-UNC, IFEG-CONICET, C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina\n\n\f2\nContrary to the initial value problem the data at the boundary T is not unique. Here, we are thinking about the\ncase where T represents a time-like surface (with respect to the unknown metric g). Therefore, what can be specified\nat the boundary is, essentially, the incoming radiation which could be given as an absolute quantity, zero for all times,\nsay, or which could be given as a function of the outgoing radiation, as is the case for a mirror in electromagnetism,\nfor instance. A further complication which makes the problem difficult to tackle arises from the absence of a reliable\nlocal definition for gravitational radiation in general relativity. Ultimately, this problem is related to the fact that\nthe initial-boundary value problem (IBVP) we are considering appears as a means for having an artificial boundary\nfor numerical calculations, and not an IBVP with physical boundaries which would, presumably, dictate the correct\nboundary conditions. This problem is, in fact, connected to two other ones: the first one is that in most formulations\nsome of the constraint variables, that is, the quantities which yield the constraint equations when set to zero, have\nnonzero propagation speeds with respect to the boundary. In particular, there are constraints propagating into the\ncomputation domain, and in this case the boundary data must be chosen with care to ensure that no constraintviolating modes enter the domain. The second problem, which conspires with the first one in making the task\ndifficult, is that in most formulations the problem is characteristic. We shall provide a precise definition shortly, but\nroughly speaking it means that there are perturbations having zero speeds with respect to the boundary, that is,\nmodes which propagate along the boundary. It is hard to control such perturbations at the boundary, and so it is\ndifficult to formulate a well posed problem if such zero speed perturbations appear in the boundary conditions fixing\nthe constraints.\nThe IBVP for Einstein's vacuum field equations was solved by Friedrich and Nagy in 1999[3] based on a frame\nformalism with very precise gauge conditions tailored to the problem. Furthermore, their formulation also modifies\nthe evolution equations near the boundary in such a way that the constraint variables propagate along the boundary.\nThis feature implies that no constraint conditions are needed at the boundary and one gets away with boundary\nconditions which only control the physically relevant field components. After this impressive work most attempts to\nsolve the problem for metric based formulations failed, the reason being that several of the issues mentioned above\nstill needed to be understood.\nThe first breakthrough came in 2006 when Kreiss and Winicour[4] realized two very important points. The first\npoint is that the second-order wave equations, when viewed as a certain pseudodifferential first-order operator, is\nnot characteristic. This could be applied[5] to Einstein's field equations in harmonic coordinates, in which case\nthe evolution equations reduce to a quasilinear system of wave equations for the metric components. Second, they\nrealized that it was possible to specify constraint-preserving boundary conditions for this system similar to Sommerfeld\nboundary conditions, i.e. non-incoming radiation conditions, but with a certain coupling obeying a hierarchy which\nallowed to prove strong stability (defined below). More recently, the above results were also established using the\nusual energy estimates based on integration by parts.[6] Furthermore, it was possible to conclude that the boundary\nconditions imposed were actually of the maximal dissipative type[7, 8] for a specific, non-standard class of firstorder symmetric hyperbolic reductions for which the system is not characteristic.[9] This also opens the interesting\npossibility to extend the result to discretizations of the equations using finite differences satisfying \"summation by\nparts\".[10]\nThe plan for the remainder of this paper is as follows. In the next section we discuss boundary conditions for\nstrongly hyperbolic systems, introduce the concept of strongly stable problems and assert the main theorem on the\nsubject together with two applications. In section III we explore the boundary conditions for the linearized theory\nand analyze the geometric uniqueness problem. Finally, conclusions and open issues are discussed in section IV.\nII.\n\nSTRONGLY STABLE IBVP\n\nConsider a first-order quasilinear system of the form\n\u2202t u\u03b1 = A\u03b1c \u03b2 (u, x, t)\u2207c u\u03b2 + B \u03b1 (u, x, t),\n\n(1)\n\nwhere u\u03b1 = u\u03b1 (x, t), \u03b1 = 1, 2, ...N , are the unknowns, \u2207c is a connection on M and A\u03b1c \u03b2 (u, x, t) and B \u03b1 (u, x, t)\ndepend smoothly on their arguments. We say the above system is strongly hyperbolic if there exists a symmetrizer,\nthat is, a symmetric, positive definite matrix H\u03b1\u03b2 = H(u, x, t, n)\u03b1\u03b2 , depending smoothly on its arguments, such that\nH\u03b1\u03b3 A\u03b3c \u03b2 nc is also symmetric for all (u, x, t) and all one-forms nc . The system is called symmetric hyperbolic if, in\naddition, the symmetrizer can be chosen independent of n. A quasilinear first-order system has a well posed initialvalue problem which is stable under zeroth order perturbations (changes in B \u03b1 (u, x, t)) if and only if it is strongly\nhyperbolic. Most physical problems describing wave propagation, i.e. electromagnetism, fluids, elasticity, general\nrelativity, etc, can be cast into first-order symmetric or strongly hyperbolic systems, see for instance Ref. [11] and\nreferences therein; in particular see Refs. [12] and [13] for covariant definitions.\n\n\f3\nModulo the smoothness assumptions strong hyperbolicity is equivalent to asking that for each nc the principal\nsymbol A\u03b1c \u03b2 (u, x, t)nc has a complete set of eigenvectors with real eigenvalues. This implies that, locally, every high\nfrequency solution is a combination of plane waves where the amplitude, frequency and wave vector of the wave is\ngiven by, respectively, the eigenvector, the eigenvalue and the one-form nc of the principal symbol. With the help\nof the symmetrizer it is possible to construct norms giving a priori energy estimates, a basic step in showing well\nposedness for the initial value problem.\nWhen boundaries are present, a systematic method1 for constructing boundary conditions consists in analyzing the\nplane waves with normal incidence to the boundary, that is, in diagonalizing the boundary matrix\nN \u03b1 \u03b2 (u, x, t) := A\u03b1c \u03b2 (u, x, t)nc ,\nwhere nc is an outgoing normal one-form to the boundary surface.2 The field perturbations \u03b4u\u03b1 can be written as\na linear combination of the eigenvectors. The coefficients corresponding to positive, negative and zero eigenvalues\nare called the incoming, outgoing and zero speed fields, respectively. One must specify a condition for each incoming\nfield. In contrast to this, the outgoing fields are determined by the evolution of the solution up to the given time.\nThe zero speed fields are also predetermined by the evolution, but unfortunately in a weaker sense in comparison\nwith the outgoing ones, and this is the main problem of the theory. The presence of these zero speed fields, that\nis the existence of zero eigenvalues of the matrix N , is usually referred as a problem with characteristic boundary.\nThe boundary condition specifies data to the incoming fields, or to an appropriate linear combination of the in- and\noutgoing fields, as is the case for reflecting boundaries. However, the linear combination cannot include zero speed\nfields. Unfortunately, in theories with constraints, the boundary conditions required to enforce the constraints do\nusually contain such zero speed fields.\nA.\n\nExample: Maxwell's equations in the potential version\n\nIn order to illustrate this problem we consider Maxwell's equations in the Lorentz gauge, in which case on obtains\na set of wave equations for the components of the vector potential Ab . These equations are only coupled among them\nby the constraint the gauge imposes, namely the requirement for Ab to be divergence-free. For simplicity we just\nconsider the theory in Minkowski spacetime, in which case\n\u2207a \u2207a Ab = 0,\n\n\u2207b Ab = 0.\n\nIntroducing the first-order derivatives of Ab as new independent fields, Dab := \u2207a Ab , the set of wave equations is\nreducible to the first-order system\n\u2202t Ab = Dtb ,\n\n\u2202t Dtb = \u2202 j Djb ,\n\n\u2202t Djb = \u2202j Dtb ,\n\nwhere j = x, y, z. Denoting by u\u03b1 the 20-component vector (Ab , Dtb , Djb ), this system has the form of Eq. (1) where\nthe principal symbol\nA\u03b1i \u03b2 ni u\u03b2 = (0, nj Djb , nj Dtb )\nis symmetrized by the trivial symmetrizer H\u03b1\u03b2 = \u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 . Therefore, the Cauchy problem for this system is well posed.\nIf initial data is given for Ab and its time derivative, both being divergence-free, then a unique solution exists, and it\ndepends continuously on the given data.\nNext, let us consider the system on the half space \u03a3 := {(x, y, z) \u2208 R3 : x > 0}. The normal matrix is obtained\nfrom the principal symbol with n = \u2212dx the unit normal one-form. Therefore, the zero, in- and outgoing fields are\nDtb + Dxb = (\u2202t + \u2202x )Ab\nDtb \u2212 Dxb = (\u2202t \u2212 \u2202x )Ab\nDyb = \u2202y Ab\nDzb = \u2202z Ab\n\n(incoming field)\n(outgoing field)\n(zero speed field)\n(zero speed field)\n\n\u2202t At = \u2202x Ax + \u2202y Ay + \u2202z Az ,\n\nwhere on the right-hand side we have explicitly written down the constraint equation in order to explain the problem:\nnamely, when written in terms of the eigenfields, we see that the constraint not only depends on the in- and outgoing\n\n1\n2\n\nSee, for instance, Refs. [14] and [10] and references therein.\nNotice that no metric is needed to determine the one-form nc .\n\n\f4\nfields, but also on the zero speed fields! Therefore, imposing the constraint on the boundary in order to guarantee\nconstraint preservation leads to a boundary condition which couples the incoming fields to outgoing and zero speed\nfields.3\nOf course, this problem does not arise when writing Maxwell's equations in terms of electric and magnetic fields,\nwhich directly leads to a symmetric hyperbolic system with trivial constraint propagation. So the fact that the\nsystem is characteristic and has constraints with nontrivial propagation has conspired to convert a simple problem\ninto an intractable one. Notice also that in the potential formulation there is no clear correspondence between the real\nradiation degrees of freedom and the in- and outgoing fields. Some of the fields describe gauge degrees of freedom.\nUntil recently, the above problem was open.\nB.\n\nWell posed and strongly well-posed boundary conditions\n\nIf one writes the equations as a first-order system, then at an initial surface the value of all the fields needs to be\nprescribed (in such a way that they satisfy the constraints if such are present) in order to obtain a unique solution.\nAt the boundary the situation is different in general. Only data for the incoming fields must be given while the values\nthe other fields acquire depend on the evolution in the bulk. Then, the question is whether or not one can control\nthe fields in terms of the given initial and boundary data when imposing a boundary condition which couples the\nincoming fields with the outgoing and zero speed fields. Here, by \"control\" we mean the following:\nDefinition 1 Consider a first-order strongly hyperbolic system of the form (1) with initial data u\u03b1 |\u03a30 = f \u03b1 and\nboundary conditions of the form L\u0393 \u03b1 (t, x, u)u\u03b1 T = g \u0393 . This problem is called strongly stable[14] if there are norms\nk * k\u03a3 , k * kT bounding the fields and their derivatives on \u03a3T and T , respectively, and a constant \u03b5 > 0 such that each\nsolution u satisfies an estimate of the form\nkuk\u03a3T + \u03b5kukT \u2264 F (T, kf k\u03a30 , kgkT ),\n\n(2)\n\nwhere F (t, x, y) is a smooth function in its arguments that vanishes when t = 0 or when (x, y) = (0, 0).\nRemark 1 In particular, the estimate (2) implies the continuous dependence of the solutions on their data. A problem\nwhich is strongly stable and for which a unique solution exists on a suitable time interval [0, T ] is called strongly well\nposed.\nA trivial example of a strongly stable problem is a symmetric hyperbolic system for which all the fields are incoming\nat the boundary, since in this case the values for all the fields must be specified there. More generally, a symmetric\nhyperbolic system with non-characteristic boundary surface and maximal dissipative boundary conditions[7, 8] is\nstrongly stable. A general theory for strictly hyperbolic first-order systems which allows to determine which boundary\nconditions lead to a strongly stable problem by purely algebraic methods was developed by Kreiss[17].\nIf a problem satisfies the same properties as in Def. 1 with the difference that the constant \u03b5 in (2) is zero, then\nwe say that the problem is stable. In this case, the estimate (2) can still be used to show existence and uniqueness\nproperties for some systems, but the set of systems for which this can be done is rather small, usually involving only\nlinear systems or very restrictive boundary conditions. For this reason, in the following, we restrict ourselves to a\nsmaller class of strongly hyperbolic systems for which strong well posedness can be shown.\nC.\n\nSecond order systems\n\nA particularly interesting set of systems are those which are second-order, in particular those who describe systems\nof wave equations of the form\ng ab (\u03a6B )\u2207a \u2207b \u03a6A + F A (\u03a6B , \u2207c \u03a6C ) = 0,\n\n3\n\nA = 1...N,\n\n(3)\n\nInstead of imposing the constraint itself on the boundary one might try to set some linear combination of its normal and time derivatives\nto zero, obtaining a constraint-preserving boundary condition that does not involve zero speed fields. Unfortunately, this trick only\nseems to work for reflecting boundaries, see Refs. [15] and [16] for the case of general relativity. In our example, such boundary conditions\nare given by \u2202t At = \u2202x Ax = \u2202t Ay = \u2202t Az = 0 which imply \u2202t (\u2207b Ab ) = 0.\n\n\f5\nwhere \u03a6A is some set of tensorial fields, g ab a Lorentzian metric which in general depends locally on the fields, and \u2207\nis a given connection on M . We impose initial conditions,\n\u03a6A |\u03a30 = \u03a6A\n0,\n\n\u2202t \u03a6A\n\n\u03a30\n\n= \u03a0A\n0\n\n(4)\n\nand boundary condition of the following form:\nd\n\nd\n\nA\n\n(T + aN )\u2207d \u03a6 =\n\nN\nX\n\nc\n\nAd\n\nB (t, x, \u03a6)\u2207d \u03a6\n\nB\n\n+\n\nN\nX\n\ndA B (t, x, \u03a6)\u03a6B + GA (t, x),\n\n(5)\n\nB=1\n\nB=1\n\nwhere here a > 0, T is a future-directed time-like vector field tangent to T and N is the outward unit normal to\nT , see Fig. 1. Furthermore, the matrix coefficients cAd B have the property that they can be made arbitrarily small\nby an appropriate local linear transformation \u03a6A \u2192 J A B \u03a6B of the fields (see Ref. [9] for the details). In particular,\nthis is the case if the matrix operator cAd B \u2207d is in upper triangular form with zeroes on the diagonal since then the\nmatrix elements cAd B can be made arbitrarily small by a simple rescaling of the fields, much like in the proof of the\nLyapunov stability theorem. We have the following theorem:[4, 6, 9]\nTheorem 1 The IBVP (3,4,5) is strongly well posed.\nThis theorem constitutes the key result which allows the consideration of a whole new class of boundary conditions\nwhich are flexible enough to solve the IBVP of electromagnetism in the potential formulation and also the full\nEinstein vacuum field equations in harmonic coordinates.[4, 9] This new result was obtained by realizing two things:\nfirst, that the above equations, when viewed as a pseudodifferential system4 and then reduced to first-order is a noncharacteristic system (see for instance Refs. [18] and [5]), and second, that the Kreiss theory[17] applies equally well\nto pseudodifferential equations. The above boundary conditions are just of the type required in this theory to give a\nstrongly well posed system. Later, the problem has been understood from a different point of view using more mundane\nenergy estimates based on integration by parts instead of pseudodifferential calculus.[6] The key observation is that\nfor second-order systems like Eq. (3) there are many different hyperbolizations, and so many different energy norms.\nThis freedom comes about because for a general Lorentzian metric there is no preferred time direction. Different\ntime directions give rise to first-order reductions which differ among each others by constraint terms, and so they are\ninequivalent. By choosing the time direction in a suitable, but nonstandard form one obtains a non-characteristic\nfirst-order system which is amenable with the usual theory. Notice that this situation is rather different than the one\nin fluid dynamics, where the four-velocity singles out a preferred time direction at each point of spacetime.\nD.\n\nApplication: Maxwell's equations in the potential version\n\nAs a first application, we return to Maxwell's equations for the four-vector potential on the half space \u03a3,\n\u2207a \u2207a Ab = 0,\n(0)\n\n(1)\n\n\u2207b Ab = 0.\n(0)\n\n(1)\n\nThe initial data Ab |\u03a30 = fb , \u2202t Ab |\u03a30 = fb is subject to the conditions \u2207b fb = 0 and \u2207b fb = 0, so that the\nconstraints are correctly propagated into the domain of dependence of the initial surface \u03a30 . The boundary conditions\nare described in a geometrically elegant way by introducing the complex null basis of vector fields\n\u221a\nK := \u2202t \u2212 \u2202x , L := \u2202t + \u2202x , Q := \u2202y + i\u2202z , Q\u0304 := \u2202y \u2212 i\u2202z ,\ni = \u22121.\nThen, we consider the following set of conditions at the boundary T = [0, T ] \u00d7 \u2202\u03a3,\n\u2207K AK = qK ,\n(gauge)\n\u2032\n\u2207K AQ = qQ\n(Sommerfeld)\n\u2207K AL = \u2212\u2207L AK + \u2207Q AQ\u0304 + \u2207Q\u0304 AQ , (constraint \u2207b Ab = 0)\n\n(6)\n\n\u2032\nwhere AK := K b Ab , \u2207K := K a \u2207a , etc... and qK , qQ\nare boundary data. The first two equations (which constitute\nthree real conditions since Q is complex) are non-incoming conditions, usually called Sommerfeld conditions, since\n\n4\n\nThink of this as the Fourier transform of the system.\n\n\f6\nthey control the incoming fields. The left-hand side of the third equation is also an incoming field, but now it is\nsourced by first-order derivatives of the fields AK and AQ , for which the first two equations already give conditions\nto. Therefore, this system conforms with the hypothesis of Theorem 1 with a = 1, T = \u2202t and N = \u2212\u2202x such that\nT + aN = K and leads to a strongly well posed problem. A simple way of understanding why this works for the\nsecond-order problem whereas it failed for the first-order reduction discussed in subsection II A is the following: the\nfirst two equations in the boundary conditions (6) give rise to a strongly stable system for AK and AQ , respectively,\nand hence AK and AQ each satisfy an estimate of the form (2). In particular, one controls all first derivatives of the\nfields at the boundary. Therefore, when applying the estimate to the wave equation for AL with the third boundary\nconditions, the source terms on the right-hand side are controlled.\nRegarding the physical interpretation of the first two conditions in Eq. (6), the first controls the incoming gauge\nfields of the form Ab = \u2207b (eiL*x ) while the second controls incoming electromagnetic fields of the form Ab = Q\u0304b eiL*x .\nHowever, a problem arises because \u2207K AQ is not gauge-invariant. For this reason, we replace the boundary conditions (6) by\n\u2207K AK = qK ,\n(gauge)\n\u2207K AQ \u2212 \u2207Q AK = qQ\n(radiation)\n\u2207K AL = \u2212\u2207L AK + \u2207Q AQ\u0304 + \u2207Q\u0304 AQ , (constraint \u2207b Ab = 0)\n\n(7)\n\nwhere now the boundary data qQ represents the KQ-components of the electromagnetic field tensor which is gaugeinvariant. The new boundary conditions (7) still satisfy the hypothesis of Theorem 1 and we obtain a strongly well\nposed problem. As we shall see, these new boundary conditions lead to gauge uniqueness, whereas the conditions (6)\ndo not.\nE.\n\nApplication: The linearized Einstein equations in harmonic coordinates\n\nAs a second application we describe a strongly well posed IBVP for the Einstein field equations in vacuum when\nlinearized on the flat background (M, \u03b7) where M = [0, \u221e) \u00d7 \u03a3, \u03a3 denoting half space and \u03b7 = \u2212dt2 + dx2 + dy 2 + dz 2\nthe Minkowksi metric. The restrictions of linearization and working on half space are done for the sake of simplicity.\nA (local in time) well posed formulation for the full vacuum equations is given in Ref. [9]. When harmonic coordinates\nare used the linearized Einstein equations are\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\ncd\nc\nb\n\u2207 \u2207c hab = 0,\nHa := \u2207 hab \u2212 \u03b7ab \u03b7 hcd = 0,\n2\n(0)\n\nwhere hab denotes the first variation of the metric fields. As in the previous application, the initial data hab |\u03a30 = fab ,\n(1)\n\n\u2202t hab |\u03a30 = fab is chosen such that the constraints Ha = 0 and \u2202t Ha = 0 are satisfied at \u03a30 . In order to describe the\nboundary conditions, we use the complex null basis of vector fields K, L, Q, Q\u0304 defined in the previous application. Let\nus start with the constraint conditions and work our way up on the triangular structure of the boundary conditions.\nThe imposition of the constraints Ha = 0 at the boundary surface T yields\n\u2207K hQQ\u0304 = \u2212\u2207L hKK + \u2207Q hK Q\u0304 + \u2207Q\u0304 hKQ ,\n\u2207K hLQ = \u2212\u2207L hKQ + \u2207Q hKL + \u2207Q\u0304 hQQ ,\n\u2207K hLL = \u2212\u2207L hQQ\u0304 + \u2207Q hLQ\u0304 + \u2207Q\u0304 hLQ .\n\n(8)\n\nThe right-hand side of the last equation contains first-order derivatives of the fields hQQ\u0304 and hLQ which are controlled\nin the first two equations. The right-hand sides of the first two equations require control of the first-order derivatives\nof hKK , hKQ , hKL and hQQ . Therefore, we impose the following gauge boundary conditions:\n\u2207K hKK = qK ,\n1\n\u2207K hKQ \u2212 \u2207Q hKK = qQ ,\n2\n1\n\u2207K hKL \u2212 \u2207L hKK = qL ,\n2\n\n(9)\n\nwhich control the fields hKK , hKQ and hKL . Here, qK , qQ and qL are boundary data, and the purpose of introducing\nthe second term on the left-hand sides of the last two equations will become clear in the next section. It remains to\ncontrol the field hQQ , which is related to the field hab = Q\u0304a Q\u0304b eiL*x describing incoming gravitational radiation. Two\n\n\f7\npossibilities have been contemplated for controlling this field. The first specifies the shear, \u03c3 := Qa Qb \u2207a Kb , of the\nnull congruence corresponding to the outgoing null vector field K.[19\u201321] In the linearized setting considered here this\nyields the condition\n\u2207K hQQ \u2212 2\u2207Q hKQ = 2\u03c3.\n\n(10)\n\nThe boundary conditions (9,10,8) satisfy the hypothesis of Theorem 1, and therefore, one obtains a strongly well\nposed IBVP.\nHowever, in the next section we will see that the shear condition (10) leads to difficulties when discussing geometric\nuniqueness. For this reason, it is convenient to replace this condition by a new condition which specifies the Weyl\nscalar \u03c80 := \u22122K a Qb K c Qd Rabcd instead, where here, Rabcd denotes the linearized curvature tensor associated to hab .\nThis gives[19, 22]\n\u22072K hQQ + \u2207Q (\u2207Q hKK \u2212 2\u2207K hKQ ) = \u03c80 .\n\n(11)\n\nThis condition involves second-order derivatives of the fields and handling it requires a little bit more work. However,\nusing the pseudodifferential first-order reduction of Ref. [4] it is possible to prove that the boundary conditions (9,11,8)\nlead to a strongly well posed IBVP, see Ref. [19]. Estimates on the amount of spurious reflections introduced by the\nboundary conditions (10) and (11) were given in Refs. [23], [24] and [19].\nIII.\n\nGEOMETRIC UNIQUENESS\n\nIn the previous section we have reviewed well posed IBVP for Maxwell's equations and the linearized Einstein's\nequations. These problems allow, from the point of view of partial differential equations, to construct unique solutions\ngiven appropriate initial and boundary data. In this section we discuss the question of gauge uniqueness, i.e. the\nrelation that initial and boundary data need to satisfy such that the solutions they give rise to are gauge related.\nAs discussed in the introduction, two initial data sets (h, k) and (h\u0303, k\u0303) on \u03a30 are related to each other by a\ndiffeomorphism of \u03a30 if and only if their corresponding Cauchy developments on D(\u03a30 ) are related to each other by a\ndiffeomorphism of D(\u03a30 ) which leaves \u03a30 invariant. It would be nice to have a similar statement for the IBVP, that is\na similar statement that does not only consider two solutions on the domain of dependence D(\u03a30 ) of the initial surface\nbut on the whole manifold M = [0, T ] \u00d7 \u03a3. Given two initial data sets (h, k) and (h\u0303, k\u0303) on \u03a30 and two boundary data\nsets q and q\u0303 on T := [0, T ] \u00d7 \u2202\u03a3 satisfying suitable compatibility conditions at the edge S := {0} \u00d7 \u2202\u03a3, one would\nlike to know under which circumstances the corresponding solutions (M, g) and (M, g\u0303) are related to each other by\na diffeomorphism on M which leaves \u03a30 and T invariant. Is it, say, possible to relate q and q\u0303 by a transformation\non T alone, such that for given initial data on \u03a30 the resulting metrics g and g\u0303 are related to each other by a\ndiffeomorphism?\nAs pointed out in Ref. [25] there are several difficulties with this question:\n(i) It is a priori not clear what the boundary data q should be. Unlike for the case of the initial surface, q cannot\nrepresent the first and second fundamental forms of T , as explained in the introduction.\n(ii) The boundary data q = (qK , qQ , qL , \u03c3) and q = (qK , qQ , qL , \u03c8), respectively, introduced in subsection II E\ndepend on a specific choice of the outgoing null vector field K, or at least on its orthonormal projection onto\nthe boundary surface which is a time-like vector field T . It is not clear if in general there is such a preferred\ntime direction on T .5\n(iii) Related to the first two items is the question whether or not it is at all possible to find a transformation on T\nwhich relates q and q\u0303, independent of the initial data.\nOne possibility for dealing with these issues is to introduce a background metric and to formulate the boundary\nconditions in a covariant way based on the covariant derivative defined by the background metric. This is the\napproach taken in Refs. [19] and [9] and further developed in Refs. [20] and [21]. However, the issues above are then\ntraded by the question on the dependency of the solution on the background metric.\nIn the following, we analyze these issues in the much simpler setting of Maxwell's equations in the potential\nformulation, where the role of the diffeomorphism is played by the gauge transformations, and linearized gravity.\n\n5\n\nHowever, see the recent proposal in Ref. [25].\n\n\f8\nA.\n\nGauge uniqueness for Maxwell's equations for the potential formulation\n\nWe reconsider the source free Maxwell equation for the four-vector potential Ab on the half-space \u03a3,\n\u2207a (\u2207a Ab \u2212 \u2207b Aa ) = 0.\n\n(12)\n\nIn contrast to the previous examples, however, we do not necessarily impose the Lorentz gauge. The initial data\n(0)\n(0)\nfor this problem are the three-vector potential and the electric field, (Aj , Ej ), and the boundary data qQ which\ncorresponds to the KQ-components of the electromagnetic field tensor and is related to the incoming electromagnetic\nradiation in the direction of L = \u2202t + \u2202x , see subsection II D. We assume that this data is smooth, satisfies the Gauss\n(0)\nconstraint \u2202 j Ej = 0 and suitable compatibility conditions at S. Since the initial value of the magnetic field only\n(0)\n\ndetermines Aj\n\nup to the addition of a gradient, we are looking for a solution of Eq. (12) such that\n(0)\n\nAj |\u03a30 = Aj + \u2202j \u03c7(0) ,\n\n(0)\n\n\u2202t Aj \u2212 \u2202j A0 |\u03a30 = Ej ,\n\n\u2207K AQ \u2212 \u2207Q AK |T = qQ ,\n\n(13)\n\nfor some smooth function \u03c7(0) on \u03a30 . The next result shows that this data determines a smooth solution Ab of\nMaxwell's equations which is unique up to a gauge transformation.\nTheorem 2 The IBVP (12,13) possesses a smooth solution Ab which is unique up to a gauge transformation \u00c3b =\nAb + \u2207b \u03c7.\nProof: We first show the existence of a solution in the Lorentz gauge, for which Eq. (12) reduces to the system\n(0)\nof wave equations \u2207a \u2207a Ab = 0. The initial data, (Ab |\u03a30 , \u2202t Ab |\u03a30 ), is chosen such that Aj |\u03a30 = Aj , \u2202t Aj |\u03a30 =\n(0)\n\n(0)\n\nEj + \u2202j A0 |\u03a30 and \u2202t A0 |\u03a30 = \u2202 j Aj , where the initial data for A0 is chosen smooth but otherwise arbitrarily.\nThen, we evolve the well-posed IBVP with boundary conditions (7) described in subsection II D, where the source\nfunction qK is chosen to be smooth and to satisfy the compatibility conditions at S, but otherwise is arbitrary. By\nconstruction, the resulting solution Ab solves \u2207b Ab \u03a30 = 0, \u2202t \u2207b Ab \u03a30 = 0, and therefore, it yields a solution of\nMaxwell's equations (12) in the Lorentz gauge with data (13) for \u03c7(0) = 0.\n(1)\n(2)\nAs for uniqueness, let Ab and Ab be two smooth solutions of Eqs. (12,13). We show there exists a function\n(2)\n(1)\n\u03c7 on M such that \u03b4Ab := Ab \u2212 Ab = \u2207b \u03c7, that is, the two solutions are gauge related on M . In order to\nsee this, we first notice that \u03b4Ab satisfies Maxwell's equations (12) with initial data satisfying \u03b4Aj |\u03a30 = \u2202j \u03b4\u03c7(0)\nand \u2202t \u03b4Aj \u2212 \u2202t \u03b4A0 |\u03a30 = 0 and trivial boundary data, qQ = 0. Next, we transform \u03b4Ab into the Lorentz gauge by\nfinding \u03c7 such that \u2207b \u2207b \u03c7 = \u2207b \u03b4Ab and setting \u00c3b := \u03b4Ab \u2212 \u2207b \u03c7. The transformed potential \u00c3b satisfies the\nLorentz gauge. Furthermore, choosing initial and boundary data for \u03c7 such that \u03c7|\u03a30 = \u03b4\u03c7(0) , \u2202t \u03c7|\u03a30 = \u03b4A0 |\u03a30 , and\n\u2207K \u2207K \u03c7|T = \u2207K AK |T we obtain \u00c3b\n\n\u03a30\n\n= 0, \u2202t \u00c3b\n\n\u03a30\n\n= 0 and \u2207K \u00c3K\n\nT\n\n= 0. Therefore, \u00c3b is a smooth solution\n\nof the IBVP described in subsection II D which has trivial initial data and satisfies the boundary conditions (7) with\ntrivial data. By uniqueness of this problem it follows that \u00c3b = 0, which implies that \u03b4Ab = \u2207b \u03c7.\nRemark 2 From the proof of the theorem it follows that the choice for A0 |\u03a30 and the boundary data qK in the IBVP\ndescribed in subsection II D with boundary conditions (7) corresponds to a pure gauge freedom.\nIn contrast to this, the same IBVP with boundary conditions (7) replaced by the gauge-dependent condition (6),\n\u2032\n\u2207K AQ |T = qQ\n, does not lead to gauge uniqueness. The reason is that a gauge transformation induces the transfor\u2032\n\u2032\nmations q\u0303K = qK + \u2207K \u2207K \u03c7 and q\u0303Q\n= qQ\n+ \u2207K \u2207Q \u03c7 on the boundary data, which overdetermines the gauge function\n\u03c7.\nB.\n\nGeometric uniqueness for the linearized Einstein equations\n\nEinstein's field equations in vacuum, when linearized about the Minkowski metric \u03b7ab , are\n\u2212 \u2207c \u2207c hab \u2212 \u2207a \u2207b (\u03b7 cd hcd ) + 2\u2207c \u2207(a hb)c = 0,\n\n(14)\n\nwhere hab denotes the first variation of the metric. The initial and boundary data are the first and second fundamental\n(0) (0)\nform of the initial surface, (hij , kij ), and the Weyl scalar \u03c80 defined in Eq. (11), respectively. We assume the data to\n\n\f9\nbe smooth, to satisfy suitable compatibility conditions at S, and to satisfy the linearized Hamiltonian and momentum\n(0)\n(0)\nconstraints Gijrs \u2202i \u2202j hrs = 0 and Gijrs \u2202j krs = 0, where Gijrs := \u03b4 i(r \u03b4 s)j \u2212 \u03b4 ij \u03b4 rs . We are looking for a solution of\nEq.

Therefore, replacing the boundary condition (11) with\nthe shear boundary condition (10) overdetermines \u03bea at the boundary, and one does not obtain geometric uniqueness.\nReturning to the issues (i)\u2013(iii) described above, we can say that in the simple case of linearization about Minkowski\nspace we have solved the points (i) and (iii). That is, we have identified the boundary data for this problem that\nleads to geometric uniqueness. Regarding point (ii), the time-like vectors T that we have chosen in our problem\ncorrespond to the future-directed unit normal to the initial surface \u03a30 at S, parallel transported along the geodesics\northogonal to \u03a30 . It is clear that when considering the nonlinear case, or even for the case of linearization about a\nnonflat spacetime, several difficulties appear. These additional difficulties are mentioned in the next section.\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND OPEN ISSUES\n\nIn spite of our better understanding of the IBVP for Einstein's field equations from the point of view of partial\ndifferential equations, several problems are still open and they have mostly a geometrical character. Geometric\nuniqueness presents at least two main obstacles. One is the question of how to generalize the local-linearized version\nwe have discussed above to the global, fully nonlinear case. The problem is that we have imposed no restrictions on\nthe normal component \u03beN of the vector field generating the infinitesimal coordinate transformation. However, such a\nrestriction is necessary in order to keep the boundary surface fixed under a diffeomorphism. Unfortunately, it does not\nseem possible to restrict \u03beN with our current boundary conditions. As a consequence, the evolution of the boundary\n(viewed as an embedded surface in the unknown spacetime (M, g)) might depend on the initial gauge, say. Actually, a\nsimilar question arises when two solutions are considered on two different Cauchy surfaces and one asks the question\nwhether or not the two solutions are related by a diffeomorphism. In order to answer this question, one needs to find\nthe corresponding Cauchy developments. Our problem has this sort of difficulty also, and one could imagine solving\nthis aspect of the problem \"along the way\", that is while one is computing the time evolution, one can ask, step by\nstep, whether or not a diffeomorphism relating the two solutions exist. This is what we call the zipper problem. One\nis mending the gap between the two boundaries as one is solving the evolution equations, see Fig. 2.\nThe second obstacle is the choice of a time-like vector field T in our present boundary conditions. Contrary to our\ninitial expectation this problem might not be of a fundamental character; it is rather a manifestation of our inability\nto specify a non-incoming radiation condition correctly. Indeed, our present conditions single out the outgoing waves\nwith wave vector along the null direction K we have chosen. In this sense, our boundary condition is perfectly\nabsorbing for such outgoing waves, but not for outgoing waves with different wave vectors. A genuine non-incoming\nwave boundary condition should be independent of any specific null or time-like direction at the boundary, and can\n\n\f10\nT\u0303\nT\n\n\u03c8\n\nK\u0303\n\nK\n\n\u03a30\n\nFIG. 2: Illustration of the zipper problem.\n\nonly depend on the normal vector to it. For simpler systems like the scalar wave equation this is indeed the case:[26]\nthe imposition of perfectly absorbing boundary conditions leads to a nonlocal condition which is independent of a\npreferred time direction at the boundary. Although this condition might not be practical because of its nonlocality, it\nis possible to derive a hierarchy of local boundary conditions depending on a null vector K approximating the nonlocal\ncondition with better and better accuracy. So it is expected that the choice of K becomes less and less relevant as\none moves down the hierarchy. It should be interesting to explore this idea for the case of general relativity, departing\nfrom a nonlocal boundary condition which is independent of K.6\nWe end this article by asking whether or not we can apply the methods discussed here to metric formulations of\nEinstein's field equations other than the harmonic one. For example, a formulation that is widely used in numerical\ncalculations is the BSSN formulation[28, 29] which yields a mixed first/second order strongly hyperbolic evolution\nsystem[5, 30, 31]. There are two ways of applying the theory discussed in this article to this problem. The first\nconsists in finding a pseudodifferential first-order reduction of the evolution system which is non-characteristic. Such\na reduction should be enough to impose constraint-preserving boundary conditions which are strongly stable, and for\nwhich the Kreiss theory can be applied. The second way is to exploit the non-uniqueness of time directions in general\nrelativity and to write down a symmetric hyperbolic first-order reduction with respect to a suitable time evolution\nvector field, such that the boundary surface is non-characteristic and constraint-preserving boundary conditions can\nbe specified in maximal dissipative form. We think that both ways should, in the end, be equivalent but this needs\nfurther investigation. Regarding the BSSN system it turns out that it possesses zero speed fields which are intrinsic to\nthe formulation[5], and therefore, it does not seem possible to apply the above methods unless one considers moving\nboundaries. Nevertheless, partial results[32] have been recently obtained based on different methods.\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank H. Friedrich, H.-O. Kreiss and J.
