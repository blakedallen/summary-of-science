The timing\nsolutions derived from the radio bursts, i.e. their periods\nand period derivatives, indicate that they are neutron stars\n(McLaughlin et al. 2006, 2009).\n\n\u22c6\n\nRamon y Cajal Research Fellow; rea@ieec.uab.es.\n\nThe detection of such sources is rather difficult, mainly\ndue to the very tiny duty cycle of their radio bursts (0.1\u2013\n1 s of radio emission per day). Detailed population studies\nshow that there may be more RRATs than canonical rotational powered radio pulsars in our Galaxy (McLaughlin et\nal. 2006, 2009; Keane & Kramer 2008).\nDetermining the nature of the emission from these objects and how many RRATs are present in our Galaxy is\nof paramount importance for pulsar emission theories, as\nwell as for neutron star population studies. Up to now many\nhypotheses on the nature of these objects have been put forward, based on the comparison with the radio pulsar class:\ne.g. that the RRATs may be neutron stars near the radio\n\"death line\" (Zhang et al. 2006), or that the sporadicity\nof the RRATs is due to the presence of a circumstellar as-\n\n\f2\n\nRea et al.\nRRAT J1819-1458\nDate\n\nFilter\n\nFWHM(pix)\n\nExp.Time\n\nMag.

Summary of the ESO-VLT observations of RRAT J1819\u20131458 and RRAT J1317\u20135759 . The NACO pixel\nsize corresponds to 0.027\u2032\u2032 .\n\nteroid belt (Cordes & Shannon 2008; Li 2006) or a radiation belt such as seen in planetary magnetospheres (Luo &\nMelrose 2007). Note that, even though they are all characterized by a similar radio bursting activity, RRATs might\nbe an inhomogeneous group of sources, comprising neutron\nstars belonging to different classes. Interesting possibilities\nare the connection with i) the transient magnetars, given\nthe recent radio detection during their outbursts (Camilo\net al. 2006, 2007); ii) with the X-ray Dim Isolated Neutron Stars (XDINSs; Haberl 2007; van Kerkwijk & Kaplan\n2007; Popov 2006), given the thermal X-ray emission discovered for RRAT J1819\u20131458 , being so far the most magnetic\nRRAT (Reynolds et al. 2006; McLaughlin et al. 2007); and\niii) with the radio pulsars showing thermal X-ray emission,\nsuch as PSR B0656+14, which has been argued to be a close\nRRAT (Weltevrede et al. 2006).\nOptical and infrared counterparts have been identified\nso far only for ten rotational powered radio pulsars (V\u223c 26;\nsee Mignani et al. 2009 for a recent review), four XDINSs\n(V\u223c 25; van Kerkwijk & Kaplan 2007), and seven magnetars (Ks \u223c20; Israel et al. 2004; Testa et al. 2008; Mereghetti\n2008). Despite being all isolated neutron stars, their optical\nand infrared emission has distinctive properties depending\non the source class. Very little is known about a possible optical or infrared component in the emission of RRATs, beside\nthe non-detection of optical bursting emission (Dhillon et al.\n2006). The detection and characterization of the nature of\nthe putative infrared emission of RRATs is a crucial help to\nassess their relation with any of the aforementioned neutron\nstar classes.\nWe report in this paper on the first infrared observations\nof RRATs, in particular we study two sources of this class\nhaving a relatively good positional accuracy: RRAT J1819\u2013\n1458 and RRAT J1317\u20135759 1 . The paper is structured as\n\nfollows: in \u00a7 2 we report on the observations and data analysis, in \u00a7 3 we show the results of our infrared study, and\ndiscussion follows (\u00a7 4).\n\n2\n\nOBSERVATIONS, CALIBRATIONS AND\nANALYSIS\n\nObservations have been obtained during years 2006\nand 2008, with the ESO VLT-UT4 Yepun, equipped\nwith the adaptive optics near-infrared camera NACO\n(NAOS/CONICA) in three filters: J (\u03bb = 12650\u00c5, FWHM\n= 2500 \u00c5), H (\u03bb = 16600\u00c5, FWHM= 3300 \u00c5), and Ks\n(\u03bb = 21800\u00c5, FWHM = 3500 \u00c5). In some cases the objects\nhave been observed in more than one epoch, as summarized\nin the Tab. 1. All the observations have been performed with\nairmass between 1.0-1.3, a seeing <1.\u2032\u2032 5, and using natural\nguide stars for the adaptive optic system.\nThe data were reduced using the standard strategies\nfor near-infrared data reduction. Flat fielding was done via\ninternal lamp flats. Sky emission has been computed using\nIRAF2 on the dithered images and then subtracted on each\nimage before de-jittering. We used the eclipse 3 package to\nco-add the images. Every pointing is the co-addition of three\nimages of 40s - 60s each, depending on the filter. This coaddition is performed by the computer on board the instrument, and we obtain only one image per dithering position.\nFig. 1 and Fig. 2 show finding charts in the Ks band for the\ntwo studied RRATs, with the source positions highlighted.\nWe first reduced the images with the IRAF version of\ndaophot, using the PSF fitting algorithm. Aperture photometry was also performed using an aperture diameter twice\nthe measured FWHM. Aperture and PSF photometries have\nbeen compared by applying aperture corrections using the\n\n1\n\nWithin our ESO\u2013VLT observing campaign, we also took observations of RRAT J1913+1333 . However during the submission\nof this paper, we became aware that the published position of\nthis RRAT was off by \u223c3\u2032 , hence the correct position (McLaughlin et al. 2009) lies outside the VLT\u2013NACO field of view of our\nobservations.\n\n2 IRAF is distributed by the National Optical Astronomy Observatories, which are operated by the Association of Universities for\nResearch in Astronomy Inc., under cooperative agreement with\nthe National Science Foundation.\n3 www.eso.org/eclipse\n\n\fESO-VLT observations of RRAT J1819\u20131458 and RRAT J1317\u20135759\n\n3\n\nFigure 1.

The basic idea of the MCS code, is that of \"partial\"\ndeconvolution: the data are deconvolved to a higher resolution, but at a level that the Nyquist criterium for a correct\nsampling was satisfied. This resulted in excellent photometric and astrometric accuracy. At variance with the standard\nMCS method, the code by Gillon et al. (2006, 2007) is faster,\n\n\f4\n\nRea et al.\nface of B \u223c 5 \u00d7 1013 Gauss, and a spin period of \u223c4.26 s\n(McLaughlin et al. 2006; Lyne et al. 2009). It is so far\nthe only member of the class for which X-ray emission has\nbeen discovered (Reynolds et al. 2006; McLaughlin et al.\n2007), with a luminosity of LX = 4 \u00d7 1033 erg s\u22121 (assuming a distance of 3.6 kpc). Diffuse X-ray emission has been\nrecently reported for RRAT J1819\u20131458 with a luminosity\nof \u223c 1032 erg s\u22121 and extending until \u223c13\u2032\u2032 from the source\n(Rea et al. 2009a). Furthermore, the RRAT error circle has\nbeen recently refined performing a bore-site correction of a\nnew Chandra observation which were tied to the 2MASS\nfield using a field star present in both the X-ray and infrared images. This resulted in an accurate position of RA\n18:19:34.173, Dec -14:58:03.57 (J2000) with a 1\u03c3 error of\n\u223c0.\u2032\u2032 3 (Rea et al. 2009a).\n\nFigure 2.

The coordinate grid in RA and Dec (J2000) is overplotted.\nNorth is on top and East is left.\n\ndetermines the PSF \"on the fly\" and fits the sky background.\nWe report hereafter the photometry delivered by this code,\nwhich was compatible, for the most isolated objects, with\nthe photometry from the imexam task of IRAF and with\ndaophot.\nCalibrations have been performed using photometric\nstandard stars observed within 4 hours from our target. The\ncalibrated catalogs were then matched for each filter, and\ncompared to verify the self-consistency of the calibrations.\nSmall differences in the calibrations have been found between the J, H, and Ks images in different epochs, in this\ncase the best quality epoch has been chosen as reference and\nthe magnitudes of the other epoch reported to it, for each\nsource respectively.\nFurther check with the 2MASS catalog has been performed but unfortunately the 2MASS objects present on the\nimages were saturated or at the saturation limit and thus\nthe zero point check with the 2MASS was not constructive.\nFurthermore, the 2MASS catalog was built from images with\na 2\u2032\u2032 pixel size, and in many cases the measured magnitudes\ncorrespond to blended objects which are, instead, resolved\nin our higher resolution images. The calibrated catalogs for\nthe single filters were then matched to produce a final master catalog.\nIn all cases, astrometric calibration was performed using\n2MASS stars as reference, yielding an average uncertainty\nof \u223c 0.\u2032\u2032 33 (1\u03c3 confidence level), after accounting for the intrinsic astrometric accuracy of 2MASS and the r.m.s. of the\nastrometric fits.\n\n3\n3.1\n\nRESULTS\nRRAT J1819\u20131458\n\nThis is the most prolific radio burster among the RRAT\nclass, with a magnetar-like dipolar magnetic field at sur-\n\nWe took observations in the three standard nearinfrared bands (J, H and Ks ), and in two epochs per filter\n(see Tab. 1). These resulted in the identification of a possible candidate near-infrared counterpart to RRAT J1819\u2013\n1458 , the only source within the 1\u03c3 X-ray positional error circle (our source A; see Fig. 1 and Tab. 2; note that we\ntook into account the astrometric error reported in \u00a72, inferring a final 1\u03c3 error circle of 0.\u2032\u2032 45). Although a few other\nsources lies close to RRAT J1819\u20131458 , in particular if we\nenlarge the X-ray positional error circle to e.g. 90%, they are\nall rather bright objects, not compatible with the expected\nmagnitudes from an isolated neutron star of any kind.\nWithin the limiting magnitude of our deepest exposure,\nKs = 21.4 (see Tab. 1), we significantly detected 380 sources\nwithin the calibrated NACO field of 25\u2032\u2032 \u00d722\u2032\u2032 , which means\nan average of 1 source on an area of 1.\u2032\u2032 452 . Given such a\ncrowded region we cannot exclude that the identification of\nsource A as a possible counterpart through its proximity\nto RRAT J1819\u20131458 's X-ray position might be due to a\nchance coincidence, the probability of which is \u223c43%. However, as a further selection criteria, assuming that an isolated\nneutron star at 3.6 kpc is not expected to have a magnitude <19 (which is the brightest K magnitude observed in\nan isolated neutron star, namely for SGR 0501+4561 and\nSGR 1806\u201320; Levan et al. 2010 in prep.; Israel et al. 2005),\nwe are then left with 115 sources in the field responding to\nsuch selection, hence the probability of having in coincidence\nwith the X-ray position a source with a magnitude expected\nfor a possible counterpart is \u223c14%.\nThe source is very faint and not visible in H and J\nbands within our limiting magnitudes (see Tab. 2). We detect the source only in our deepest Krms image on June\n2006, however no variability can be claimed since the following epoch was not deep enough to detect such a faint\nsource. We did not find any J, H and Ks variability for\nthe objects close to our target, both investigating different\nframes of a single observation, and comparing the several\nepochs. In Fig. 3 we show the color-magnitude and colorcolor diagrams for all sources in the field of RRAT J1819\u2013\n1458 . We did not find any source with peculiar colors. We\nover-plot the limits we have for our candidate counterpart\n(source A), which unfortunately was detected only in the\nKs band, hence we have only limits on its colors, namely\nJ-Ks >1.94 and H-Ks >1.44 . If source A is indeed the counterpart to RRAT J1819\u20131458 , then its Ks luminosity would\nbe LNIR = 1.62 \u00d7 1030 erg s\u22121 (assuming a 3.6 kpc distance;\n\n\f4\nKS\n\nJ\u2212H\n\n2\n\n20\n\n20\nKS\n\n0\nH \u2212 KS\n\n2\n\n4\n\n\u22122\n\n0\n\n2\nJ \u2212 KS\n\n4\n\n6\n\n\u22122\n\n\u22122\n\n10\n\n0\n\n15\n\n15\n10\n\n\u22124\n\n\u22124\n\n5\n\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\n\nESO-VLT observations of RRAT J1819\u20131458 and RRAT J1317\u20135759\n\n\u22122\n\n0\nH \u2212 KS\n\n2\n\n4\n\nFigure 3.

The star and vertical line are relative to the limits we have\nfor our candidate counterpart, source A.\n\nsee also Tab. 3), while if it is not, the 3\u03c3 upper limit we\nderived corresponds to LNIR < 1.51 \u00d7 1030 erg s\u22121 .\nFurthermore, we searched for the possible near-infrared\ncounterpart to the X-ray diffuse emission discovered around\nRRAT J1819\u20131458 , removing all the sources in the field on\nthe basis of their fitted PSF. We did not find any extended\nemission down to a limiting Ks surface brightness of > 18.5\nmag/arcsec2 (at a 3\u03c3 confidence level).\n3.2\n\nRRAT J1317\u20135759\n\nWith a period of \u223c2.64 s and a magnetic field of \u223c 5 \u00d7\n1012 Gauss, this RRAT has timing properties similar to\nmany canonical radio pulsars (McLaughlin et al. 2006,\n2009). The source position has been refined through radio timing analysis of the bursts: RA 13:17:46.26, Dec 57:59:30.32 (J2000) with a 1\u03c3 error of 0.\u2032\u2032 57 (McLaughlin\net al. 2009). X-ray observations resulted in a luminosity upper limit on its X-ray counterpart of LX < 7.5 \u00d7 1032 erg s\u22121\n(assuming a distance of 3.2 kpc; Rea & McLaughlin 2008).\nWe observed this object using three infrared bands (J,\nH, Ks ). No infrared counterpart has been detected, with\nlimiting magnitudes reported in Tab. 1, and a 3\u03c3 upper limit\non the Ks luminosity of LNIR < 1.3 \u00d7 1030 erg s\u22121 . We show\nin Fig. 2 the Ks finding chart around RRAT J1317\u20135759 's\nradio timing position.\n\n4\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nOptical counterparts have been identified so far only for ten\nrotational powered radio pulsars, and only five of them were\nobserved in the infrared band (see Mignani et al. 2009 for\na recent review). The radio pulsars' infrared/optical emission depends mainly on the pulsar age: young objects show\npure magnetospheric emission, middle-aged ones appear to\nhave composite spectra with an additional thermal component most probably arising from the cooling neutron star\nsurface, while for older objects there is more confusion, but\non average there is evidence for a dominant magnetospheric\n\ncomponent (Mignani et al. 2001; Zharikov et al. 2004).\nThe situation is more favorable in the case of XDINS.\nFour XDINSs have secure optical identifications (V\u223c 25;\nvan Kerkwijk & Kaplan 2007), with a thermal optical emission which exceeds by a factor of \u223c 10 the extrapolation of\ntheir blackbody-like soft X-ray spectrum. This suggests that\nthe thermal component responsible for the optical emission\narises from a cooler and larger area, with respect to their\nthermal X-ray emission. None of them have been detected\nin the infrared band yet (Lo Curto et al. 2007).\nThe neutron star infrared zoo, has been joined some\nyears ago by the magnetars. In particular, observations from\nlarge telescopes such as i.e. ESO, Gemini, CFHT, and Keck,\nled to the discovery of faint (Ks \u223c20) and, in some cases variable, infrared counterparts for many magnetars (see Tab. 3\nfor a complete list, and also Israel et al. 2004; Testa et al.\n2008; Mereghetti 2008). It is not yet clear whether infrared\nemission in magnetars arise from reprocessed X-ray emission\nvia a fossil disk around the neutron star (Chatterjee et al.\n2000; Perna et al. 2000), or of magnetospheric origin (Beloborodov & Thompson 2007), but it is certainly true that\nwith respect to normal radio pulsars, their infrared emission is much more efficient (see also below and Fig. 4). Other\ncrucial peculiarities of magnetars' infrared emission are their\nstrange infrared colors, usually very red with respect to their\nfield stars (see e.g. Israel et al. 2004).\nWe report in this paper on the first infrared observations\nof RRATs, performed using the NACO camera on the ESOVLT (see \u00a72). We found that among the two studied RRATs,\nRRAT J1819\u20131458 and RRAT J1317\u20135759 , only the former\nhas a candidate infrared counterpart (see Fig. 1) within our\nlimiting magnitudes (see Tab. 1). Unfortunately, we could\ndetect the possible counterpart only in one Ks pointing (the\ndeepest we had), with a magnitude of Ks = 20.96 \u00b1 0.10,\nhence we have no handle on the colors of this source because our J and H observations were not deep enough (see\nFig. 3 for the limits on its color). On the other hand we have\nalso no handle on the possible variability of this infrared\ncounterpart (a behavior typical of magnetar infrared emission; Israel et al. 2002; Rea et al. 2004; Israel et al. 2009),\n\n\fRea et al.\n\n36\n\n34\n\n6\n\nmagnetars\n\nmagnetars\n\nlog(LX)\n\n30\n\nlog(LNIR)\n\n34\n\n32\n\nLNIR=Lrot\n\n32\n\npulsars\n\nRRATs\n\nRRATs\n\n26\n\n30\n\n28\n\npulsars\n\nLX=Lrot\n\n32\n\n34\nlog(Lrot)\n\n36\n\n30\n\n38\n\n32\n\n34\nlog(Lrot)\n\n36\n\n38\n\n0\n\n30\n\nmagnetars\n\n\u22122\n\n36\n\nmagnetars\n\n34\nlog(LX)\n\n\u22124\n\nRRATs\n32\n\n\u22126\n\nlogLX=7.7+0.85 logLNIR\n\n30\n\n\u22128\n\nlog(LNIR/Lrot)\n\nRRATs\n\n\u221210\n\npulsars\n12\n\npulsars\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\nlogB (Gauss)\n\n26\n\n28\n\n30\nlog(LNIR)\n\n32\n\n34\n\nFigure 4. Squares, circles and the star indicate rotation-powered pulsars, magnetars, and RRAT J1819\u20131458 , respectively, while the\narrow shows RRAT J1317\u20135759 's upper limit (see also Tab. 3). Top panels: infrared and X-ray luminosities as a function of the rotational\nluminosity (solid lines represent LNIR =Lrot and LX =Lrot , respectively). Bottom panels: on the left we report on the infrared and\nrotational luminosity ratio (LNIR /Lrot ) versus the pulsar magnetic field, while on the right-side we show the X-ray versus the infrared\nluminosities. The solid line here represents the fit to the data (see text for details). For all the objects LNIR and LX have been computed\nin the Ks and 1-10 keV bands, respectively. Errors on the source distances are not taken into account in the luminosity uncertainties.\n\nthis is why we consider it as a candidate counterpart which\nneeds to be confirmed with further data.\nWith a magnitude of Ks = 20.4 (after correcting for the\nextinction in the Ks -band derived from the X-ray absorption\nvalue NH \u223c 9 \u00d7 1021 cm2 ; Predehl & Smith 1995; Cardelli,\nClayton & Mathis 1989), our candidate source A has a Ks\nflux density of FKs \u223c 4.6 \u00d7 10\u221229 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 Hz\u22121 . If\nconfirmed, this relatively bright infrared emission strengthens the connection of RRAT J1819\u20131458 with the magnetar\nclass. In particular, the intensity of its candidate counterpart\nwould place it well among the magnetar luminosities compared with those of normal pulsars. As for the magnetars,\nthe luminosity of this possible counterpart, lies above the\nextrapolation of the blackbody modelling its X-ray emission\n(McLaughlin et al. 2007). In Tab. 3 and Fig. 4 we computed\nthe near-infrared luminosities (LNIR ) in the Ks band of all\nisolated neutron stars detected at such wavelength (namely\n5 radio pulsars and 7 magnetars). Furthermore, we calculated their X-ray luminosities in the 1-10 keV band4 taking\n\n4\n\nWe used for all magnetars the fluxes resulting from a spectral\nfit with a resonant cyclotron scattering model or two blackbodies\n\ncare of choosing X-ray observations as close as possible to\nthe date of the near-infrared ones, crucial for most of the\nmagnetars which show variable emission in both such energy\nbands. However, given the non-exact simultaneity of the Xray and near-infrared observations this luminosity comparison should be taken with the due uncertainty.\nIn Fig. 4 (top panels) we plot the infrared and X-ray luminosities of pulsars, magnetars and the two RRATs studied\nin this paper, as a function of their rotational energies (see\nalso Tab. 3). It is clear that while the rotational energy is not\nat all sufficient to power magnetars' and RRAT J1819\u20131458\nX-ray emission, it might well suffice to be the reservoir for\ntheir infrared luminosity, as the radio pulsar case. However,\neven if powered by a similar mechanism, the efficiency of\nmagnetars in converting rotational power in infrared luminosity, is much higher than normal radio pulsars, possibly\ndue to their high magnetic fields (see also Mignani et al.\n2007, 2009; Zane et al. 2008). This is particularly clear in\n\n(Rea et al. 2008, 2009b), with the aim of not overestimating the\nNH values, which would have spuriously produced overestimated\nX-ray luminosities.\n\n\fESO-VLT observations of RRAT J1819\u20131458 and RRAT J1317\u20135759\nSource\n\nd(kpc)\n\nlog(Lrot )\n\nlog(LNIR )\n\nlog(LX )\n\nlog(B)\n\nAge \u03c4 (kyr)\n\nCrab\nPSR 1509\u201358\nVela\nPSR 0656+14\nGeminga\n\n1.7\n5.2\n0.3\n0.3\n0.16\n\n38.66\n37.25\n37.25\n34.58\n34.50\n\n32.51\n31.36\n27.88\n27.36\n26.51\n\n35.85\n34.28\n31.70\n30.16\n30.62\n\n12.57\n13.18\n12.53\n12.67\n12.21\n\n1.24\n154\n11.3\n111\n342\n\n1,2,3\n4,5,6\n7,8,9,10\n11,12,13,14\n11,15,16\n\n1E 1547\u20135408\u2217\nSGR 1806\u201320\u2217\n1E 1048\u20135937\u2217\nXTE 1810\u2013197\u2217\nSGR 0501+4516\u2217\n4U 0142+61\u2217\n1E 2259+586\u2217\n\n9.0\n8.7\n3.0\n4.0\n5.0\n5.0\n3.0\n\n35.00\n34.40\n33.90\n33.60\n33.49\n32.10\n31.70\n\n32.10\n32.61\n30.22\n30.60\n31.51\n31.21\n30.04\n\n34.16\n35.21\n34.00\n33.58\n34.77\n35.32\n34.43\n\n14.32\n15.15\n14.78\n14.46\n14.23\n14.11\n13.76\n\n1.41\n0.22\n2.68\n1.13\n1.32\n67.7\n228\n\n17,18,19\n20,21,22\n23,24,25\n26,27\n28,29\n30,31\n32,33,34,35\n\nRRAT J1819\u20131458\nRRAT J1317\u20135759\n\n3.6\n3.2\n\n32.50\n31.43\n\n30.21 (<30.18)\n<30.11\n\n33.30\n<32.87\n\n13.50\n12.76\n\n120\n3330\n\nthis work, 36, 37\nthis work, 36, 38\n\n7\n\nRefs.\n\nTable 3.

In particular, young objects\nas these particular pulsars, present more powerful magnetospheric emission, responsible for both the near-infrared\nand X-ray emission, which of course combined with their\nclose distances, make them visible in both bands. Comparing the near infrared and X-ray luminosity of all isolated neutron stars detected in both these bands, we found\nan intriguing correlation (see Fig. 4 bottom-right panel):\nlog(LX ) = 7.7 \u00b1 2.8 + (0.85 \u00b1 0.09) \u00d7 log(LNIR ). This empirical fit resulted in a \u03c72 = 1.3, with the magnetars having\nthe largest spread over the model. This relation might be\nuse to have a very rough estimate of the infrared luminosity\nof a known or new isolated neutron star, however, given the\nlarge errors in the distances (which have not been taken into\naccount in the fit), this relation should be used with the due\nuncertainty.\nIn this picture, the Ks magnitude of our proposed candidate counterpart to RRAT J1819\u20131458 (source A) is too\nbright to be the counterpart of a normal radio pulsar, given\nits low rotational power, while it is well in line with the\nvalues observed for magnetars (see Fig. 4 top and bottomleft panels). This would represent only one among a series of\nother properties which connects this RRAT to the magnetar\nclass, as its inferred dipolar B field (5\u00d71013 Gauss), its bright\n\nX-ray emission with respect to other RRATs (McLaughlin\net al. 2007; Rea & McLaughlin 2008; Kaplan et al. 2009), as\nwell as the presence of a diffuse X-ray nebula proposed to\nbe powered by the magnetic energy (Rea et al. 2009a).\n\n5\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nNear-infrared observations of RRAT J1819\u20131458 and\nRRAT J1317\u20135759 resulted in a possible candidate counterpart for the former (Ks = 20.96 \u00b1 0.10), while no infrared\ncounterpart was detected for the latter (within the limiting magnitudes reported in Tab. 1). However, the proposed\ncounterpart to RRAT J1819\u20131458 needs further confirmation due to the relatively high chance coincidence probability. Studying the near-infrared and X-ray luminosities of all\nisolated neutron stars detected in the Ks -band, with respect\nto other characteristics such as the rotational luminosity and\nthe magnetic field, we show that the rotational energy may\nwell be the resevoir of the magnetars and RRAT J1819\u20131458\ninfrared emission. However, in this picture the efficiency\nof converting rotational energy in near-infrared luminosity\nshould be necessarily higher for highly magnetic sources.\nBased on observations collected at the European\nSouthern Observatory, Paranal, Chile under programs ID:\n077.D-0395(A), 077.D-0395(B), 077.D-0395(C), and 077.D0395(D).
