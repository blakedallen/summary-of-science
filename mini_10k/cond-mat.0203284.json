Finally, we discuss the role played\nby the disordered vitreous matrix in influencing the optical features of defects.\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe study of vitreous silica, the amorphous silicon dioxide (a-SiO 2 ), is currently an\nattractive research field in solid state physics and material science [1-3]. The physical\nproperties of high transparency in a wide spectral region (visible, UV, vacuum-UV) and\nlow conductivity, in combination with favorable mechanical characteristics and low\nmanufacturing costs, have led to the widespread utilization of silica-based materials in\nmany technological applications, like manufacturing of optical fibers, lenses and\noptoelectronic devices.\nThese exceptional features depend critically on the maintenance of defect free band\ngap [4]. For this reason the understanding of the nature and the formation mechanisms of\ndefects in a-SiO 2 plays a fundamental role in both the technological and basic research. To\nthis end, the combined use of several spectroscopic techniques and silica materials different\nfor their manufacturing processes or for external treatments (irradiation, heating) could\nprovide a powerful method to improve the knowledge of the properties of defects. In this\npaper we focus our attention on the optical absorption (OA) and photoluminescence (PL)\nbands detected in as grown natural silica in a wide spectral region from visible to UV. Aim\nof this work is to exemplify the whole optical activity in terms of an energy level diagram\nwith the radiative and non radiative transitions accounting for the spectral and kinetics\nfeatures, also as a function of temperature. Moreover, we investigate the role played by the\nvitreous matrix in determining the observed optical activities. It is worth noting that the\nstudy of defects in silica holds a more general significance in obtaining new insights on the\nrelationship between the properties of an optically active defect and the structural and\ndynamic properties of its environment in other disordered materials.\nThe present paper is so structured: in the section 2 we outline the theoretical\nbackground on the optical properties of a generic point defect in silica, in section 3 we\ndescribe the experimental method and finally in the section 4 we review and discuss our\nexperimental results.\n\n\f-2-\n\n2.\n\nTheoretical background\n\n2.1\n\nPoint defect in silica\n\nThe point defect is usually defined in the contest of a crystalline network, if the\nlattice site is occupied differently than in the perfect crystal [5]. The defects may be\nclassified as intrinsic and extrinsic. The first type includes unoccupied sites (vacancies) and\noccupied sites that in the perfect crystal are unoccupied (interstitial). The second type\nconsists of impurities at sites that in the crystal lattice either are occupied by atoms of the\npure material (substitutional impurities) or are unoccupied (interstitial impurities). An\noverview of the different kinds of defects is shown in Fig. 1.\nThe concept of defect can also be extended to\namorphous materials, like silica, whose structure\nmatches the crystalline \u03b1-quartz only in a short-range\na\norder [2]. As depicted in Fig. 2, the structural unit of\nc\nsilica is the SiO 4 tetrahedron where the Si atom is\nbonded to four O atoms with O-Si-O angle of 109.5\u00b0.\nThe lack of long-range atomic order is due to the large\nb\nspread of tetrahedral linkage angle Si-O-Si,\nstatistically distributed between 120\u00b0 and 180\u00b0. In this\nframework, a point defect is present when the array of\nd\nSi and O atoms of the ideal silica network is broken\ndown by an imperfection.\nThe presence of defects in the vitreous matrix\nmay drastically modify the optical properties of the\nFig. 1\nCrystal lattice with\ndifferent types of defects: intrinsic\nhost material [4, 6, 7]. Indeed, defects exist in different\nvacancy (a) and interstitial (b);\nelectronic states that can cause optical transitions as\nextrinsic substitutional (c) and\nabsorption and luminescence with lower energies than\ninterstitial (d).\nthe fundamental absorption edge of the silica material,\napproximately 9 eV, from valence to conduction band.\nFor this reason, a point defect is also defined a color\ncenter or chromophore.\nEven if these transitions are localized at the\npoint defect, the optical spectra are influenced by its\nenvironment. While in an isolated center, the energy\ntransferred in an optical transition has to match the\nSi\ndifference between the electronic levels whose spread\nis limited only by the excited state lifetime, for a\nO\nchromophore embedded in a matrix, it can be shared\nbetween a local electronic contribution and a wide\nvariety of phonon excitations of the vibrational modes\nof the matrix. Moreover, owing to the amorphous\nnature, each defect can exist in different local\nFig. 2 Fragment of a\nrearrangements\nof\nthe\nsurrounding\nmatrix\nregular silica network\n(conformational inhomogeneity) and the energy\nassociated to transitions between the electronic levels\nis largely distributed. Then, a wide range of photon\nenergies can be involved in the transition and the\nspectrum of absorption or luminescence consists of\nbroad bands.\n\n\f-3-\n\n2.1\n\nOptical absorption transition\n\nWe consider now the transition occurring between two electronic states of a point\ndefect: the ground state (0) and the excited one (1) [5, 8, 9]. In Fig. 3, we sketch the\npotential energy curves \u03b50 and \u03b51 as a function of the generalized normal coordinate Qf. In\nthe same figure are also depicted the vibrational levels associated to the quantum numbers\nnf and mf in the states (0) and (1), respectively, due to the nuclear oscillations. If the\nequilibrium positions of atoms in the ground and excited state are different, the set of\nnormal coordinates changes from Qf (in the ground state) to Q'f =Qf - \u2206f (in the excited\nstate). Then, the total energies associated to the (0) and (1) states can be expressed by:\nE (0 )\n\neq\nTot = \u03b50\n\nNf\n\n+\n\nE (1)Tot = \u03b51eq +\n\n\u2211 h\u03bd f (n f\n\nf =1\nNf\n\n\u2211 h\u03bd f (m f\n\nf =1\n\n+1 2\n\n)\n\nnf = 0, 1, 2, ...\n\n(1)\n\n)\n\nmf = 0, 1, 2, ...\n\n(2)\n\n+1 2\n\nwhere \u03b50eq and \u03b51eq are the energies of the two electronic states when all the nuclei are in\ntheir equilibrium position. In the above Eqs., we have assumed that the frequency\u03bdf of\nnormal modes is the same in the two states (0) and (1) (linear coupling approximation).\nAccording to the Franck-Condon approximation, that is, the electronic transitions\noccurring in a time much faster than the nuclear motion, the absorption is described as a\nvertical transition with respect to the energies associated to the two states in the\nconfiguration coordinates diagram. If E1,0 = E1 \u2212 E 0 = h\u03bd1,0 is the energy value matching\nthe quantum transition between the two states (0) and (1), for a dl path length of a sample\nhaving N0 identical non-interacting absorbers per unit volume in the ground state, the\ndifferential energy loss by the electromagnetic field is given by [8]:\n2\n4\u03c0 2 1 E\n\u2212 dI (E ) = I ( E )N 0 2\n\u22c5 \u03b4 (E \u2212 E1, 0 ) R1, 0 dl\n(3)\n3h 4\u03c0\u03b50 c\nwhere I(E) is the intensity of the electromagnetic field flowing through the sample and R1,0\nis the quantum-mechanical matrix element of the electric dipole moment M between the\ntotal eigenfunctions \u03c80 and \u03c81 of the two states (transition moment).\n\n\u03b51 (Qf )\n3\n\nEnergy\n\n2\n\n\u03b5 0 (Qf )\n\n1\nmf = 0\n\nh\u03bdf\n\n3\n2\n1\nnf = 0\n\nh\u03bd f\n\u2206\n\nQf\n\n0\n\nf\n\nQf\n\nFig. 3 Optical absorption and luminescence transitions\nbetween the ground (\u03b50 ) and excited (\u03b51 ) electronic states in\na configuration coordinate diagram\n\n\f-4-\n\nR1,0\n\n2\n\n= \u03c81 M\u03c80\n\n2\n\n(4)\n\nBy integration over a unitary path of absorbing material, one obtains the following\nexpression for the absorption coefficient:\n2\nI (E ) N 0 \u03c0 E\n\u03b1( E ) = Ln 0\n=\nR1 ,0 \u03b4 (E \u2212 E1 ,0 )\n(5)\n2\nI (E)\n3h \u03b50 c\nwhere I0 (E) is the intensity of the electromagnetic field incident on the sample at energy E.\nTaking into account the finite lifetime \u03c4 of the excited state, the \u03b4 function can be replaced\nby a Lorentzian shape function (with 2 \u0393 = 1 \u03c4 ):\n2\nN \u03c0E\n\u0393\n\u03b1( E ) = 0 2\nR1 ,0\n(6)\n3h \u03b50 c\n(E \u2212 E1,0 )2 + \u0393 2\nIn order to obtain a suitable expression of the transition moment R1,0 , we make use\nof the Born-Oppenheimer approximation and write the eigenfunction \u03c8 of the total system\nby the product of the electronic wavefunction \u03c6 and the nuclear one \u03c6 [5, 8]:\n\u03c80 (r, Q ) = \u03c60 (r, Q ) \u22c5 \u03c60 (Q )\n(7)\n\u03c81 (r , Q') = \u03c61 (r , Q') \u22c5 \u03c61 (Q' )\n(8)\nwhere r is the electronic coordinate and Q and Q' are the set of normal nuclear coordinates\nin (0) and (1), respectively, which allow to write \u03c60 and \u03c61 as a product of harmonic\noscillator functions:\n\u03c60 (Q ) =\n\nNf\n\n\u220f\u03c6(Q f ) ;\nf =1\n\n\u03c61 (Q \u2032) =\n\nNf\n\n\u220f \u03c6(Q f\nf =1\n\n\u2212\u2206f\n\n)\n\n(9)\n\nWe can consider the electronic dipole moment M as composed by an electronic\nterm, M el . (r ) , and nuclear one, M nucl . (Q ) [8]. So, we can write:\nR1, 0 = \u222b\u222b\u03c81* ( r, Q \u2032)M\u03c80 (r , Q )d\u03c4e d\u03c4 v =\n\n\u222b\u222b \u03c61 (r , Q \u2032)\u03c61 (Q \u2032)M el .

(Q )\u03c60 (r , Q )\u03c60 (Q )d\u03c4e d\u03c4 v\n*\n\n*\n\n(10)\n\nwhere the integral is carried out on the space of the electronic \u03c4e and vibronic \u03c4\u03bd\ncoordinates. Since during the transition from (0) to (1) the nuclei remain almost stationary\nin the equilibrium position of the ground state, the electronic eigenfunction \u03c6 can be\nassumed to depend upon Q=Q0 . Besides, we note that M nucl . ( Q) does not depend on the\nelectronic coordinates but only upon vibrational coordinates Q. In this way, the expression\nfor R1,0 can be readjusted as follows:\nR1,0 = \u222b \u03c61* (r , Q0 )M el .

If there is no coupling between the\nelectronic transition and the vibrational modes, the set Q' coincides with Q (\u2206f = 0) and,\nowing to the orthogonality of harmonic oscillator wavefunctions, only terms with the same\nvibrational quantum numbers (i.e. mf = nf) contribute to the transition. In the presence of\ncoupling, Q'\u2260 Q and also terms with mf \u2260 nf will contribute to the transition.\nTaking into account the Eqs.

(1) and (2) to take into account the\nenergies associated to the transitions from nf = 0 in the state (0) to various mf in the state\n(1), as shown by the upwards arrows (continuous line) in Fig. 3. In particular, E00\nrepresents the energy difference between the mf = 0 level in (1) and nf = 0 in (0), i.e. the\nenergy of the purely electronic transition. The dimensionless Huang-Rhys factor Sf [10]\n(linear coupling constant) is defined by:\nh\u03bd f 2\nSf =\n\u2206f\n(16)\n2\nand it measures the coupling strength between the electronic transition 0\u21921 and the f\u2013th\nvibrational mode that determines the rearrangement of the nuclei from their equilibrium\nposition by \u2206f. Then, Eq. (15) shows that the absorption band at T=0 K results from the\nsuperposition of a series of Lorentzians whose intensity is modulated by the Poissonian\ndistributions product:\nNf\n\n\u220fe\nf =1\n\n\u2212S f\n\nmf\n\nSf\n\nmf!\n\n(17)\n\nAt T \u2260 0, the vibrational levels with nf \u2260 0 in the ground state (0) can be thermally\npopulated according to the Boltzmann law and contribute to the transitions toward the\nexcited state (1), as shown by the dashed line arrows in Fig. 3. Generally, if Tmax. is the\nupper limit of the temperature range investigated, it is possible to distinguish between\nvibrational modes with high (\u03bdh ) and low (\u03bdl) frequency [11]. The \u03bdh modes have frequency\nsuch that h\u03bd h >> K B Tmax , where KB is the Boltzmann constant, so that only the vibrational\nlevel with nh = 0 is occupied in the temperature range up to Tmax . This fact implies that,\nassuming a set of Nh high frequency modes, only transitions from nh = 0 in the state (0) to\nmh = 0, 1, 2,... in the state (1) occur. At variance, the \u03bdl modes can change their population\non varying the temperature. Therefore, assuming a set of Nl low frequency modes,\ntransitions from nl = 0, 1, 2,... in (0) to ml = 0, 1, 2,... in (1) take place and are relevant in\nchanging the shape of the absorption spectrum. If we consider the contribution of these Nl\nmodes as a single mode (Einstein oscillator) with mean frequency value \u03bdl and mean\nlinear coupling constant Sl, the expression of the absorption at the temperature T is given\nby:\n\n\f-6-\n\n\uf8ee \uf8eb N \u2212 S S mf \uf8f6\uf8f9\n\uf8f7\uf8fa \u00d7\n\u03b1 (E, T ) = M 0 E \uf8ef \u2211 \uf8ec \u220f e\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\nm\n!\n\uf8ef\uf8f0{m }\uf8ed f =1\nf \uf8f8\uf8fa\n\uf8fb\nf\n\nh\n\nf\n\nf\n\n\u00d7\n\n\u0393\nNf\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ecE \u2212 E \u2212 h m \u03bd\n\u2211 f f\n00\n\uf8ec\nf =1\n\uf8ed\n\n2\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7 + \u03932\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n\u2297\n\n1\n\u22c5e\nW (T )\n\n1 E2\n\u2212 \u22c5\n2 \u22c5W 2 (T )\n\n(18)\n\nwhere \u2297 represents the convolution operator, f ( E ) \u2297 g ( E ) = \u222b f ( E \u2212 E ' ) \u22c5 g ( E ' ) dE ' , and\nwhere\nh \u03bdl\nW 2 (T ) = N l S l h 2 \u03bdl 2 coth\n(19)\n2K BT\nAccording to Eqs. (17), (18) and (19), the absorption profile is given by the\nsuperposition of a series of Voigtians (Gaussian convolutions of Lorentzians) whose width\nincreases as the temperature increases while the energy peak remains constant. We recall\nthat the Eq. (18) for the absorption spectrum has been obtained in the linear coupling\napproximation, i.e. assuming the same vibrational frequency \u03bdf of normal modes in the\nstates (0) and (1). At variance, if the transition from (0) to (1) changes the vibrational\nfrequencies \u03bdf (non linear coupling), temperature effects on the peak position of the\nabsorption band are also present and must be taken into account [11, 12].\nFurther contributions to the absorption lineshape are the inhomogeneous effects\narising from the different local environments surrounding the point defects in amorphous\nmaterials. Generally, this site-to-site non-equivalence results in a spectral distribution of the\npurely electronic transition energies E00 . If the mapping between the conformational and the\nspectral heterogeneity is linear [11], the distribution function for E00 is given by a Gaussian\nfunction:\ng abs (E 00 ) =\n\n1\n\n' 2\n(\nE00 \u2212 E00\n)\n\u2212\n2\n2\u22c5\u03c3inh\n\n(20)\n2\u03c0\u03c3 inh\npeaked at the mean energy E'00 whose width \u03c3inh does not depend on the temperature. So,\nthe whole optical absorption spectrum is given by the convolution of Eqs. (18) and (20) and\nits total width is determined by the different weights of the broadening mechanisms:\nlifetime, electron-phonon interaction, inhomogeneous broadening.\n2.3\n\ne\n\nPhotoluminescence activity\n\nFollowing light absorption, the inverse transition from the excited state (1) to the\nground state (0), shown in Fig. 3, causes a spontaneous emission of light also called\nphotoluminescence. In particular, for two states having the same spin multiplicity, the\nelectronic transition is allowed and in this case it is called fluorescence. As in the excited\nstate the nuclei relax towards the minimum energy configuration at Q f = Q f 0 + \u2206 f in a\nmuch shorter time (10-12 s) than the fluorescence lifetime (10-8 s), the light emission occurs\nafter that the state (1) has reached the thermal equilibrium [9]. Because the excitation of\nphonons reduces the energy available to the photon, the luminescence emission occurs at\nlower energies than the absorption.\nThe expression of the intensity of light emitted from the excited state (1) is obtained\nby the relation between the Einstein coefficients for absorption and spontaneous emission\n[13]. If E0 ,1 = E1 \u2212 E0 = h\u03bd0 ,1 is the energy value matching the quantum transition\n\n\f-7-\n\n(1)\u2192(0), the luminescence intensity of a sample having Nlum identical non-interacting\ncenters per unit volume in the excited state is given by:\n1\n2\n\u0393\nI PL (E ) = N lum\nR0,1 E 4\n(21)\n4\n4\n3h \u03c0\u03b50 c\n(E \u2212 E 0,1 )2 + \u0393 2\nwhere R0,1 is the quantum-mechanical matrix element of the electric dipole moment M for\nthe transition between the states (1) and (0):\nR0,1\n\n2\n\n= \u03c80 M\u03c81\n\n2\n\n(22)\n\nBy comparing the Eqs. (21) and (22) with the Eqs. (6) and (4), respectively, it is\npossible to see that the emission band profile is mirror like to the absorption one apart from\na shift of the peak position toward lower energies. Because the excited state (1) is at\nthermal equilibrium during the luminescence emission, its vibrational levels are populated\naccording to the Boltzmann law. At T=0 K, only transitions from the vibrational level with\nmf=0 in the state (1) to different vibrational levels with various nf of the state (0) can occur,\nas depicted by downwards arrows (continuous line) in Fig. 3. So, the luminescence\nspectrum assumes a shape which depends on the linear coupling constant Sf as in Eq. (15).\nAt T \u2260 0, the coupling between the electronic transitions and the low frequency \u03bdl modes\ninduces changes in the luminescence spectrum like those reported for the absorption. In this\ncase, the width of the emission profile as a function of the temperature can be expressed by\nEq. (18), but \u03bdl indicates the mean frequency value of the \u03bd l modes in the state (1).\nMoreover, as for the absorption, the conformational heterogeneity in amorphous materials\ncauses a spread of the emission energies associated with the transition from (1) to (0),\nwhich results in the inhomogeneous broadening of the photoluminescence spectrum.\nGenerally, following light absorption, different excitation pathways can occur in a\npoint defect. In Fig. 4, we depict a typical energetic level scheme consisting in a singlet\nground state S0 , two singlet excited state S1 and S2 and the first triplet excited state T1 [14].\nThe absorption S0 \u2192S1 and the fluorescence S1 \u2192S0 has been already discussed through the\nFig. 3. At variance, if the system is excited to an electronic state S2 , it rapidly relaxes to the\nlowest vibrational levels of S1 . This process is called internal conversion and it occurs in\n\nVibrational relaxation\n~10-12 sec\nInternal\nconversion\n~10-12 sec\n\nS2\n\nIntersystem\ncrossing\nphonon assisted\n\nS1\n\nT1\nAbsorption\n-15\n~10 sec\n\nAbsorption\n-15\n~10 sec\nFluorescence\n~10-8 sec\n\nPhosphorescence\n>>10-8 sec\n\nS0\nGround state\n\nFig. 4 Excitation and relaxation pathways involving the ground\nand the first excited states localized on a point defect\n\n\f-8-\n\n\u223c10-12 sec. As the fluorescence lifetime is \u223c10-8 sec, the internal conversion is complete\nbefore the radiative emission from S2 to a lower singlet state so that the transition S0 \u2192S2 is\nable to excite the emission S1 \u2192S0 . Finally, when the system is in the S1 state, it can\nundergo a radiation-less transition to the first triplet state T1 of lower energy. This non\nradiative conversion mechanism, known as intersystem crossing process, can be thermally\nactivated by the interaction of luminescent defect with the lattice (phonon assisted process)\n[8]. The relaxation of T1 towards the ground state causes a light emission\n(phosphorescence) at energies lower than the fluorescence. As the transition T1 \u2192S0 is\nforbidden, the phosphorescence lifetimes (10-1 -10-5 sec) are several orders of magnitude\nlonger than those of fluorescence. Therefore, the light absorption due to the transitions from\nthe ground state S0 to higher excited states S1 and/or S2 can excite at least two luminescence\nbands: one associated to the S1 \u2192S0 transition (fluorescence) and the other associated to the\nT1 \u2192S0 transition (phosphorescence).\n\n3.\n\nExperimental method\n\n3.1\n\nSamples\n\nIn this work, we investigated a set of silica specimens of commercial origin, chosen\nso as to cover a wide spectrum of preparation techniques. These samples can be grouped in\nfour standard silica types according to the early Hetherington classification [15]:\nType I natural dry silica is obtained by fusion of powder of quartz crystal via electric\nmelting in vacuum or in an inert gas at low pressure. It contains negligible OH amount but\nabout the same metallic impurities such as Al, Ge or alkali, totally of the order of 10 part\nper millions (ppm) by weight as the unfused raw material.\nType II natural wet is prepared by fusion of quartz crystal in a flame. This material has\nhigher chemical purity than the type I because some impurities are volatilized in the flame\nbut as it is prepared in a water-vapor atmosphere it contains nearly 150 ppm of OH groups.\nType III synthetic wet is made by the vapor-phase hydrolysis of pure silicon compounds\nsuch as SiCl4 . It contains the highest OH content (up to 1000 ppm) but it is virtually free\nfrom metallic impurities.\nType IV synthetic dry is obtained by the reaction of O2 with SiCl4 in a water-vapor-free\nplasma. In this way, the concentration of OH is reduced to less than 1 ppm but excess of Cl\nand oxygen in the form of -O-O- linkages are present.\nTable 1.

All samples used in our measurements have sizes of 5\u00d75\u00d71 mm3\nwith the major surfaces optically polished.\n3.2\n\nExperimental techniques\n\nAbsorption measurements at a wavelength between 190 to 340 nm, corresponding to\n4.0-6.5 eV, were performed at room temperature using a JASCO V-570 double-beam\nspectrometer.\nPhotoluminescence emission (PL) and excitation (PLE) spectra, measured in steady\nstate regime, were obtained by a Jasco PF-770 instrument, mounting a Xenon lamp of\n150 W as light source. The samples were placed with the major faces at 45\u00b0 with respect to\nthe exciting beam and the PL light collected in the direction opposite to the reflected beam\n(45\u00b0-backscattering-geometry). The obtained excitation and emission spectra are corrected\nfor wavelength dependent effects as spectral density of the source and the spectral response\nof detecting system.\nPL and PLE measurements as a function of the temperature were also carried out by\nmounting the samples in a continuous flow helium cryostat (Oxford OptistatCF), equipped\nwith four optical windows and a temperature control (Oxford ITC503). The temperature\ncould be varied from 4.2 up to 350 K and at the required temperature; the spectra were\nrecorded after 10 min for thermal equilibrium.\nLifetime measurements were performed by using the synchrotron radiation (SR) at\nthe SUPERLUMI station on the I-beamline of HASYLAB at DESY (Hamburg, Germany.\nThe time decay of the transient PL was measured using 512 channels for scanning the time\ninterval of 192 ns between adjacent SR pulses, pulse width 0.5 ns. These measurements\nwere carried out at T=300 K and at T= 10 K.\n\n4.\n\nResults\n\n4.1\n\nPL activity in natural silica excited in the UV range: emissions at 3.1 eV and 4.2 eV\n\nIn this section we review the experimental results concerning the optical absorption\nand the photoluminescence activity excited in the UV range in our natural silica [19-22]\naiming to characterize the two PL bands centered at ~3.1 eV and ~4.2 eV and to make clear\nsome aspects regarding their excitation mechanisms and their temperature dependence.\nIn Fig. 5 is reported the UV absorption spectrum detected in the I301 sample. The\nmain absorption band (B2\u03b2 band [23]) is characterized by a peak energy value\nE0 =5.15\u00b10.01 eV, by a full width at half maximum FWHM=0.46\u00b10.02 eV and by an\namplitude at maximum \u03b1 max=0.46\u00b10.02 cm-1 , as obtained by a best fit procedure in\nGaussian components. We note that the spectral components in the blue side of the\nspectrum are attributed to the tail of other OA bands located at higher energies and are\ntaken into account in the fit procedure.\n\n\fAbsorption coefficient (cm-1)\n\n- 10 -\n\n2.5\n\n2.0\n\n5.15 eV\n\n1.5\n\n1.0\n4.5\n\n5.0\n\n5.5\n\n6.0\n\nEnergy (eV)\nFig. 5 UV absorption profile for the natural silica I301.

This spectrum exhibits two PL emissions: the first, at low\nenergies, is centered at E0 =3.16\u00b10.01 eV (with a FWHM=0.43\u00b10.02 eV), the second is\npeaked at E0 =4.26\u00b10.01 eV (with a FWHM=0.48\u00b10.02 eV). These two emissions are\nlabeled as the \u03b2 and \u03b1 E bands, respectively [24]. In the same figure, the PLE profiles for the\nemissions at 3.16 eV and 4.26 eV are also displayed. Apart from the small energy shift\n(0.05 eV), the excitation spectra of these two PL bands are quite similar to each other and\nhave nearly the same FWHM (0.46 eV) as the B2\u03b2 absorption band. We stress that the\ndifference between the peak energies of the PLE spectra of \u03b2 and \u03b1 E can be related to the\ninhomogeneous distribution of the relaxation rates of the excited states [7, 22, 25, 26] in\ndisordered systems such as the amorphous SiO 2 .\n\nPL amplitude (arb. units)\n\n0.5\n5.08 eV PLE\n\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n\n5.03 eV PLE\n\n4.5\n\n5.0\n\n5.5\n\n3.16 eV\n\n4.5\n\n5.0\n\n5.5\n\n4.26 eV\n\n0.1\n0.0\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\n4.0\n\n4.5\n\nEnergy (eV)\nFig. 6 Photoluminescence spectrum excited at 5.0 eV for the I301 sample.\nTwo main emissions are detected, centered at 3.16 eV (\u03b2) and 4.26 eV (\u03b1E ),\nrespectively.

On the\nbasis of these evidences, we can assert that the whole optical activity, here referred to as\nB type, originates from the same defect.\n4.2\n\nTemperature dependence: intersystem crossing process\n\nPL integrated intensity (arb. units)\n\nThe study of temperature effects on the PL activity is a useful tool to obtain\ninformation on the fine details of the processes involved in the excitation pathways. With\nthis aim, we have investigated the temperature dependence of the \u03b2 and \u03b1 E emissions in the\nrange 4.5-300 K. Fig. 8 shows the PL spectra excited at 5.0 eV, at various temperatures, for\nthe I301 sample. The two PL bands exhibit an opposite behavior: on increasing the\ntemperature, the \u03b1 E band decreases while the \u03b2 band increases starting from a near-to-zero\nvalue at low temperature.\nThe anticorrelated dependence on T of the \u03b1 E and \u03b2 emissions is summarized in\nFig. 9.

For the sake of clarity, the radiative and non radiative processes with the\nrelative rates are also indicated. We note that this quite general diagram was proposed by\nL.N. Skuja [25] to take into account the energetic levels of a defect consisting of a twofold\ncoordinated Ge. According to the reported scheme, the \u03b1 E band is associated to the allowed\nS1 \u2192S0 fluorescence transition at a rate K rF , in agreement with its lifetime of the order\nof ns [21, 22]. On the other hand, the \u03b2 emission is ascribed to the spin-rule forbidden\nT1 \u2192S0 phosphorescence transition at a rate K rP , in agreement with its longer decay time\n(\u223c110 \u03bcs) [25]. Both emissions can be excited by the OA band B2\u03b2 related to the S0 \u2192S1\ntransition: the \u03b1 E band directly and the \u03b2 band via an intersystem crossing process between\nS1 and T1 .\nIn this scheme, the intensities of the two emissions are proportional to the\npopulations N S1 and N T1 of the states S1 and T1 , and to the radiative rate K rF and K rP ,\nrespectively, according to:\nI F \u221d K rF \u22c5 N S 1\nI P \u221d K rP \u22c5 N T1\n\n(23)\n(24)\n\nMoreover, the rate equations of N S1 and N T1 can be written as:\n\n[\n\n[\n\n][\n\u2212 [K + K ]\u22c5 N\n\n]\n\ndN S 1\nF\n= I 0 \u22c5 1 \u2212 e \u2212\u03b1\u22c5 d \u2212 K rF + K nr\n+ K ISC \u22c5 N S1\ndt\n\n(25)\n\ndN T1\n= K ISC \u22c5 N S1\ndt\n\n(26)\n\nP\nr\n\nP\nnr\n\nT1\n\n]\n\nwhere I 0 \u22c5 1 \u2212 e \u2212\u03b1\u22c5d represents the intensity of the light absorbed by ground state defects.\nActivation Energy\n6\n\n\u2206\u0395\n\nS1\n\n5\n\nF\n\nP\n\n3\n\nPL ~3.1 eV\n\nKr\n\nP\n\n2\n\nK nr\n\n\u03b2 band\n\nF\n\nKnr\n\nS0\n\nPL ~4.2 eV\n4\n\nT1\n\nKr\n\n\u03b1E band\n\nOA B 2\u03b2 band\n\nKisc\n\nOA ~5.1 eV\n\n1\n0\n\nFig. 10 Outline of the electronic levels and of the related radiative and non radiative transitions\naccounting for the absorption at ~5.1 eV (B2\u03b2) and the emissions at ~4.2 eV (\u03b1E ) and ~3.1 eV (\u03b2).\n\n\f- 14 -\n\nIn stationary (time-independent) condition, as obtained in our experiments under\ncontinuous light excitation, the first member in Eqs.

According to the energetic level diagram outlined in Fig. 10, the\ninterconversion between the two excited states S1 and T1 is related to the intersystem\ncrossing process. As reported in Section 2, the efficiency of this non-radiative mechanism\nis expected to depend upon the temperature as it arises from the interaction with lattice\ndynamics (phonon assisted process). In this way, changes induced by the temperature on\nKISC could imply changes in the S1 \u2192S0 fluorescence quantum yield QF and, according to\nEqs. (27) and (28), opposite changes in the T1 \u2192S0 phosphorescence intensity.\nWe can suppose, as a first approximation, that the intersystem crossing process is\ngoverned by the presence of an activation barrier, so that the rate KISC depends upon\ntemperature according to the Arrhenius law [9]:\nK ISC = K0 \u22c5 exp ( \u2212 \u2206E K B T )\n(31)\nwhere \u2206E is the activation energy.\nMoreover, since the sum of the integrated intensities of the two PL bands is constant\nin the temperature range 4.5-300 K (Fig. 9), we can assume that the temperature effects due\nF\nP\nto K nr\nand K nr\nare negligible in comparison with KISC. To corroborate this statement we\nalso note that the lifetime of the \u03b2 emission is temperature independent, as reported in [25],\nP\nso evidencing that K nr\n<< K rP .\nIn this simplified scheme, the ratio \u03b7 between the integrated intensities (zero-th\nmoment M0) of \u03b1 E and \u03b2 is expected to be:\n[M 0 ]\u03b1E K rF\n\uf8eb \u2206E \uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\u03b7=\n\u2245\n= A0 \u22c5 exp \uf8ec\uf8ec\n(32)\n[M 0 ]\u03b2 K ISC\nK\nT\n\uf8ed B \uf8f8\n\nwith A0 = K rF K0 .\nTo make this interpretation quantitative, we report in Fig. 11 the temperature\ndependence of \u03b7. The scales used in the graph make easier the comparison with the\nEq. (32). As shown in the inset, a simple Arrhenius law is obeyed only at high temperature\n(T>150 K) with \u2206E=0.078\u00b10.003 eV and A0 =(1.4\u00b10.1)\u00d710-2 . At variance, below 120 K,\nthe ratio between the integrated intensities of \u03b1 E and \u03b2 tends to a constant value and the\nintersystem crossing process becomes temperature independent.\n\n\f- 15 -\n\nLog (\u03b7)\n\n2\n1\n\n2\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n-1\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n-1\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n1/T (1000 K-1)\nFig. 11 Temperature dependence of the ratio \u03b7 between the integrated\nintensities of the \u03b1E and \u03b2 bands. The continuous line is a guide to the eye.\nThe inset shows the initial part of the curve, in the temperature range\n100 to 300 K. In this case, the dashed line results from a fit of Eq. (32) for\nT >150 K.\n\nWe stress that the knowledge of the \u03b7 behavior allows us to take into account the\ntemperature dependence of the PL bands trough the ratio between KISC and K rF . In\nparticular, we get that the KISC value is \u223c4\u22c5 K rF at T=300 K whereas it is ~0.02\u22c5 K rF for\nT<120 K. Then, in agreement with the data of Fig. 9, the \u03b1 E fluorescence quantum yield Qf,\nF\nexpressed by Eq. (29) without the term K nr\n, decreases by a factor ~5 on increasing the\ntemperature from 4.5 to 300 K.\nA final remark concerns the freezing of the intersystem crossing process at\nT<120 K. We observe that deviations from the Arrhenius law of KISC are known to occur in\nother systems, like e.g. proteins [29, 30], and interpreted in terms of a distribution of the\nenergy activation barriers \u2206E. In this frame, we can qualitatively interpret our results by\nhypothesizing that among the site-to-site non equivalent defects in natural silica, there is a\nsmall fraction of B-active centers with \u2206E values sufficient low to populate the T1 state also\nat very low temperature.\n\n4.3\n\nLifetimes measurements\n\nA further experimental analysis of the luminescence activity of B-centers was\nperformed by detecting the kinetic behavior of the \u03b1 E fluorescence under pulsed excitation.\nAccording to Eqs. (25) and (23), if the exciting light is abruptly switched off (I0 =0) we get:\n\n[\n\n]\n\ndN S1\nF\n= \u2212 K rF + K nr\n(T ) + K ISC (T ) \u22c5 N S1\ndt\nand the PL signal decays by following the single exponential low:\nI\n\nF\n\n\u221d K rF\n\n\u22c5N\n\nS1\n\n(0)\n\nt\n\u2212 F\n\u22c5e \u03c4\n\n(33)\n\n(34)\n\n\f- 16 -\n\n[\n\nwhere N S1 (0 ) is the initial population in the excited state and \u03c4 F = K rF + K ISC\n\n]\n\n\u22121\n\nis the\n\nF\nF\nlifetime, assuming K nr\n<< K rF and K nr\n<< K ISC . Therefore, lifetime measurements can\nbe useful to find out the temperature influence on the competition between radiative and the\nintersystem crossing rates arising from the S1 state.\nAs shown in Fig. 12, the decay of \u03b1 E under excitation at 5.0 eV evidences relevant\nvariation on changing the temperature. At T=10 K (a) the time decay is well described by a\nsingle exponential law with a lifetime \u03c4=7.3\u00b10.1 ns. We note that at this temperature the\nrelaxation of the excited state S1 is essentially a radiative process and the lifetime tends to\n\n( )\u22121\n\nthe value \u03c4 \u2248 K rF , so we can derive K rF \u223c1.4\u00d7108 s-1 . On the other hand, the faster\ndecay of curve (b), evidences the contribution of the intersystem crossing process to the S1\n\n(\n\n)\u22121\n\n\u03b1 E PL intensity (arb. units)\n\nrelaxation and the lifetime is expected to decrease down to \u03c4 = K rF + K ISC . We observe\nthat at this temperature, the decay is not a single exponential. Then, it is intuitive to ascribe\nsuch a peculiar relaxation kinetic to the distribution of KISC rates, which are effective at\nroom temperature.\n\n(a) T=10 K\n\n103\n\nS1\n\nT1\n\nK rF\n\n102\nS0\n\n101\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n\u03b1 E PL Intensity (arb. units)\n\nTime (ns)\n\n(b) T=300 K\n\n103\n\nKISC\n\nS1\n\n102\n\nT1\n\nKrF\nS0\n\n101\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\nTime (ns)\nFig. 12 Time decay of the \u03b1E emission at 4.2 eV observed under\nexcitation at 5.0 eV at T=10 K (a) and T=300 K (b).

In the paragraph 4.2 we have discussed\nabout the marked temperature dependence of the \u03b1 E intensity (zero-th moment M0 ), which\nis related to the effectiveness of the phonon, assisted intersystem crossing process. Here we\nfocus our attention on the first (M1 ) and second (M2 ) spectral moments, which are\ncalculated from the experimental data according to the following definitions:\n\u221e\n\n\u222b E \u22c5 f (E )dE\n\nM1 = \u2212 \u221e\n\u221e\n\n\u222bE\n\n(35)\n\nM0\n2\n\n\u22c5 f ( E )dE\n\nM2 = \u2212\u221e\n\n\u2212 M 12\n\n0.3\n\n\u03b1E band\n\nTemperature\n\nPL amplitude (arb.units)\n\n(36)\nM0\nWe recall that M1 is the mean value of the emission energy and measures the position of the\nPL band and M2 is the mean square deviation of the spectral distribution f(E) and measures\nits width.\n\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n4.0\n\n4.5\n\nEnergy (eV)\nFig. 13 \u03b1E band profile detected at various temperature.

Solids 232234 (1998) 514-519, copyright 1998 by Elservier\nSciences.\n\nIn Fig. 14, we report the thermal behavior of M1 (a) and M2 (b). Fig. (a) evidences\nthe red-shift of the \u03b1 E emission on increasing the temperature, M1 decreases from\n4.32\u00b10.01 eV at T=4.5 K to 4.26\u00b10.01 eV at room temperature. We note that the\ntemperature dependence of M1 suggests the occurrence of a strong interaction of the\nelectronic states with the surroundings. In this limit, the transition changes the vibrational\nfrequencies of the ground and excited states (non linear coupling) resulting in temperature\neffects on the peak position of the optical bands [11, 12].\nFig. (b) shows the broadening of the PL band on increasing the temperature. At low\ntemperature M2 assumes the value of 0.028\u00b10.001 (eV)2 , while it increases up to\n0.031\u00b10.001 (eV)2 at room temperature. As already reported in section 2, we can take into\naccount the thermal behavior of M2 , by assuming that the broadening of the PL emission of\na single chromophore is dominated by its interaction with the local vibrational modes of the\nsurrounding nuclei. The increase of the temperature causes an increase of the width of the\nband profile due to population of vibrational levels associated to the low frequency modes\nin their first excited states S1 . This effect adds to the coupling with the vibrational modes at\nhigh frequencies (temperature independent) whose energy distribution determines the shape\nof the PL bands. We stress that the broadening due to the electron-phonon coupling is a\nproperty of the individual center and it appears to be the same for any center, so we can call\nit homogeneous contribution. Moreover, in an amorphous material such as the silica, the\nsite-to-site non-equivalence among the point defects embedded in the silica matrix results\nin an additional inhomogeneous broadening of the PL spectra. We note that the values of\nthe kinetic decay constants, that are of the order of 2\u22c5108 s-1 (\u223c10-6 eV), allow us to exclude\nthat the radiative decay rate contributes in a significant way to the observed bandwidth,\n\n\f- 19 -\n\nM 2 \u22480.17 eV. Therefore, we can take into account the total broadening of the \u03b1 E\nemission band by the following equation:\n\uf8eb h \u03bdl \uf8f6\n\uf8f7 + \u03c3 2stat.\nM 2 (T ) = Nl \u22c5 S l \u22c5 h 2 \u03bdl 2 coth \uf8ec\uf8ec\n(37)\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ed 2 K BT \uf8f8\nwhere <\u03bdl>, Nl and Sl are the mean frequency value, the number and the mean linear\ncoupling constant of the bath of vibrational modes at low frequency (Einstein oscillator\nmodel), and the static width \u03c3stat. accounts for the temperature independent broadening due\nto the Poissonian distribution of the high vibrational structures of a single center smeared\nby the broadening due to the inhomogeneous distribution of the transition energy of the\nluminescent centers. The continuous lines in Fig. 14 (b) represent the fit of Eq. (37) to the\nexperimental data, the relative parameters being reported in Table 3.\n\nTable 3 Values of the parameters obtained by fitting the Eq. (37) to the\nthermal behavior of M2 for the \u03b1E band. Taken from J. Non Cryst.\nSolids 232-234 (1998) 514-519, copyright 1998 by Elservier Sciences\nNl \u22c5 Sl\nh<\u03bdl > (meV)\n\u03c3stat. (meV)\n6\u00b11\n\n12\u00b12\n\n160\u00b15\n\nOn the basis of these results, we can infer that, in the interaction with the\nsurrounding silica matrix, the B-active defect has access to a low-frequency dynamics\n(h<\u03bdl>\u223c 12 meV). Moreover, we stress that the bandwidth of the \u03b1 E band is mainly related\nto \u03c3stat \u223c 160 meV. In this respect, a direct trial to distinguish between the coupling with\nhigh frequency modes and the conformational heterogeneity of the PL centers can be\nachieved by using site-selective luminescence or spectral hole-burning techniques to\nsuppress the inhomogeneous broadening effect [9]. These site-selective techniques have\nproven in detecting vibrational structures in non-bridging oxygen hole centers (NBOHC) in\nsilica [32], whereas no such structures have been reported so far for other defects in silica.\n\n5. Conclusions\nIn this paper, we have reviewed the optical properties of point defects in silica. In\nparticular, our investigation has been focused on the study of PL emissions via their\nrelationship with the absorption, their temperature dependence and their excitation\npathways in the UV region. In this respect, the experimental evidences reported in section\n4 contribute to outlining a clear picture of the optical features observed in a wide variety of\nnatural silica samples and can be summarized as follows:\ni)\nTwo PL bands \u03b1 E at \u223c4.2 eV and \u03b2 at \u223c3.1 eV, related to the OA band at ~5.1\neV (B2\u03b2) characterize the optical activity B associated to native defects present\nin natural silica.\nii)\nThe temperature dependence of the PL intensities is governed by a phonon\nassisted intersystem crossing process occurring at the rate KISC between the\nsinglet and the triplet excited states from which the emissions \u03b1 E and \u03b2\noriginate, respectively.\niii)\nThe departure from the simple Arrenhius law of the intersystem crossing\nthermal behavior and the no-single exponential time decay of \u03b1 E at room\ntemperature indicate a distribution of KISC rates, probably related to different\nenvironments of the centers in the amorphous structure of the silica.\n\n\f- 20 -\n\nThe analysis of the thermal behavior of the \u03b1 E emission profile (first and second\nspectral moment) enables to evaluate quantitatively the parameters of the\nelectron-phonon coupling between the optically B active center and its\nenvironment.\nAs a final remark, the experiments and the related results described in this work\nprove that the parallel use of different luminescence techniques is a powerful tool to\nimprove the understanding of the optical properties of defects in amorphous solids.\niv)\n\nAcknowledgments\nThe author thanks S.
