A\ngeneral goal of the survey is a compilation of a\ncatalog of AGN which would be used in part for\nplanning for future space VLBI missions.

A major program is the\n5 GHz VSOP Survey Program, which we supplement here with VLBA observations to produce a\ncomplete and flux-density limited sample. Using\nstatistical methods of analysis of the observed visibility amplitude versus projected (u,v) spacing,\nwe have determined the angular size and brightness temperature distribution of bright AGN radio cores. On average, the cores have a diameter (full-width, half-power) of 0.20 mas which contains about 20% of the total source emission, and\n14 \u00b1 6% of the cores are < 0.04 mas in size. About\n20 \u00b1 5% of the radio cores have a source frame\nbrightness temperature Tb > 1.0 \u00d7 1013 K, and\n3 \u00b1 2% have Tb > 1.0 \u00d7 1014K. A model of the high\nbrightness temperature tail suggests that the radio\ncores have a brightness temperatures \u2248 1 \u00d7 1012\nK, and are beamed toward the observer with an\naverage bulk motion of \u03b2 = 0.993 \u00b1 0.004.\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nOn 1997 February 12, the Institute of Space and\nAstronautical Science of Japan (ISAS) launched a\nsatellite called HALCA, with an 8-m radio telescope dedicated exclusively to Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) (Hirabayashi et al.\n1998). The mission, called VSOP, with a spacecraft apogee height of 21400 km, gives unparalleled brightness temperature sensitivity, and allows studies of radio sources with angular resolution as small as 0.2 mas. About 75% of the mission observing time was devoted to peer-reviewed\nscientific projects, proposed by the world-wide astronomical community (called General Observing\nTime, GOT). Many VSOP publications show the\ncomplexity and evolution of the sub-milliarcsec\nstructure of AGNs (Piner et al. 2000; Lobanov &\nZensus 2001; Lister et al. 2001a; Tingay et al. 2002;\nKameno et al. 2003; Murphy et al. 2003; Giroletti\net al. 2004).\nIn order to insure that a complete flux-density\nlimited sample of AGNs were observed during the\n\n2.\n2.1.\n\nCompilation of the Data-Base\nThe VSOP AGN Survey Sample\n\nThe VSOP 5 GHz AGN sample (Hirabayashi\net al. 2000) was defined to include all cataloged\nextragalactic, flat-spectrum radio sources in the\nsky with\n\u2022 a total flux density at 5 GHz, S \u2265 0.95 Jy\n\u2022 a spectral index \u03b1 \u2265 \u22120.50 (S \u221d \u03bd \u03b1 )\n\u2022 a galactic latitude |b| \u2265 10\u25e6 .\nThis sample contains 344 sources. This spectral index criterion eliminated from consideration\nabout 300 extragalactic sources with flux density\n> 1 Jy near the galactic plane, or with steep radio\nspectra and thus little milliarcsec structure. These\n\n1 Present address: Swinburne University of Technology,\nHawthorn, Vic. 3122, Australia\n\n2\n\n\fwith HALCA for three or four hours were used.\nThe large variation of the observation time and\nground telescope participation produced a set of\nimages with a wide range of quality and resolution, and direct analysis of them can lead to uncertainties in determining the unbiased properties\nof AGNs. Thus, our statistical analysis uses the\nvisibility data directly in order to determine the\nAGN distribution of angular size and brightness\ntemperature..\nIn order to extend the range of resolution of\nthe data, we concatenated the VSOP data and\nthe VLBApls data, and for this reason we have\nrestricted the analysis to the 303 survey sources\nnorth of declination \u221243\u25e6 which is covered by the\nVLBA observations. In Fig. 1 we give an example of the concatenated data set for J1626\u22122951\nand relevant processing. Fig. 1a shows the visibility amplitude versus the projected (u,v) spacing\nfor the VSOP data observed on 22 February 1998,\nplus the VLBA data observed on 05 June 1996.\nThe effect of the source variability is obvious since\nthe VLBA points which overlap in spacing with\nthe VSOP points are considerably higher. Using\nthe flux density monitoring of the sources with\nthe Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA)\n(Tingay et al. 2003), we find that the flux density of this source in June 1996 was 3.0 Jy, but\nonly 2.1 Jy in February 1998. Although the variable component in most AGN are confined to a\nsmall region of the emission extent, the overlap in\nspacing and position angle between the VLBA and\nVSOP surveys are sufficient to compare their visibility amplitude. In the example of Fig. 1a, if the\nVLBA amplitude scale is multiplied by 2.1/3.0, a\nbetter continuity between the VLBA and VSOP\npoints, as shown in Fig. 1b, is obtained. (The\nlarge change in flux density for this source is atypical.) Source variability corrections to an accuracy\nof 10% were obtained from the ATCA and University of Michigan3 source monitoring programs\nwhich include most of the sources in the VSOP\nsample. Finally, in order to decrease the size of\nthe database, we averaged the observed visibility\namplitude in bins of width 40 M\u03bb, and this plot is\nshown in Fig. 1c. With the above processing, we\nobtained a database containing the visibility amplitude over a wide range of projected spacing for\n\nsources are arcseconds in size and dominated by\ndouble-lobed structures (eg. FRI and FRII type\nradio sources) and are generally associated with\nradio galaxies. At the beginning of 2002 when\nthis database was assembled, about 50% of the\nVSOP observations had been observed and processed. Because the selection of observed sources\nwas randomized by the need to fill in observing\nholes between the GOT observations, little bias is\nintroduced by not completing the observations of\nthe entire list (See Fig. 1 of Paper III) before this\nanalysis of the data.\nAn integral part of the planning for the VSOP\nSurvey was VLBA observations over a 24-hour period in 1996 June, call the VLBA pre-launch survey (VLBApls). All 303 sources of the 344 sample\nsources north of declination \u221243\u25e6 were observed\nat 5 GHz, and the survey results are given by\nFomalont et al. (2000b)2 . The VLBApls survey\nserved two important functions for the VSOP Survey. First, the VLBA results, with baselines up\nto 8000 km, indicated which of the AGN are sufficiently large so that higher resolution VSOP observations on baselines between 5000 km and 25000\nkm were not feasible. Secondly, when combined\nwith the VSOP data, this enhanced database covers baselines between 100 km and 25000 km so that\na detailed analysis over a large range of the angular structure of AGNs could be made. Although\nthe VLBA data were implicitly used in Paper III\nin order to obtain VSOP images which were consistent with the lower resolution data, direct use of\nthe VSOP+VLBA data provides a more accurate\ndetermination of the sub-milliarcsec properties of\nAGNs, less susceptible to selection effects, observational biases and the present incompleteness of\nthe observations.\n2.2.\n\nDetermining the Visibility Database\n\nThe observational procedures and data reduction techniques for the survey experiments are\ngiven in Papers II and III. After calibration and\nediting, the basic database for each source is composed of a set of correlated visibilities (amplitude\nand phase), measured at many (u,v) spacings. Numerous examples of the character of the data are\ngiven in Fig. 2 of Paper III. For many of the survey\nobservations only two or three ground telescopes\n\n3 http.//www.astro.lsa.umich.edu/obs/radiotel/umrao.html\n\n2 http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/vlba/html/6CM/index.htm\n\n3\n\n\fall sources.\nThe VSOP Survey source list of the 303 sources\nnorth of declination \u221243\u25e6 is given in Table 1. It\nis arranged as follows:\n\nThese values are meant solely to be an indication of which sources have a component of\nhigh brightness temperature. Refer to Paper III for a more exact determination of\nthe brightness temperature of source components. The approximate brightness temperature here has been used in later discussions.\n\nColumns 1 and 2 give the J2000 name, and an\nalternative name.\n\nColumn 9 gives the date of the VSOP observations in day-month-year format.\n\nColumn 3 lists the total flux density of the source\nat 5 GHz. Most of the sources are variable\nand the total flux density comes from that of\nthe original finding catalog, as described in\n(Hirabayashi et al. 2000), or from the VLBA\nobservations.\n\nColumn 10 gives the data of the VLBA observation in day-month-year format. Most were\nobtained on 05 June 1996 from the VLBApls\nsurvey. VSOP survey data extracted from\nthe VSOP general observing time observations which used the VLBA have the same\ndate as the VSOP observation.\n\nColumn 4 gives the optical identification: q=quasar,\ne=elliptical galaxy, g=faint galaxy (> 24\nmag), b=BLLac object, e=empty field.\n\nColumn 11 indicates with an 'M' if the source is\nincluded in the 15 GHz Monitoring Of Jets\nin Active galaxies with VLBA Experiments\n(MOJAVE program)5.\n\nColumn 5 gives the redshift, if available. Many\ncome from the NASA/IPAC Database (NED,\nhttp://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu)\nColumn 6 gives the VSOP observation code. For\nadditional information for any source, see\nthe VSOP Survey Program website4 .\n\n3.\n\nColumn 7 gives the status of the survey observation. Class A (115 sources) means that\nthe VSOP data for the source have been\ncompletely processed and are used in this\nanalysis. Class B (124 sources) means that\nthe VSOP data for the source are not yet\navailable. Class C (50 sources) are in the\nVSOP AGN sample, but were so resolved in\nthe VLBA observations, they were not included as VSOP targets. However, they are\nincluded as representative of low brightness\nobjects in the statistical analysis. Class D\n(14 sources) are so resolved with the VLBApls, that they have been removed from\nthe VSOP AGN sample as far as the statistical analysis is concerned.\n\nThe data for all sources were processed to that\nof the form given in Fig. 1c. In order to have\na statistic which is independent of the total flux\ndensity of the source, we normalized the measured\ncorrelated flux density of each source to the average visibility amplitude in the first bin of average\nspacing 20 M\u03bb. We will denote this normalized\nflux density as the relative visibility (RV) and it\nis a property of the source structure, regardless\nof the total intensity of the source. The properties of the RV with projected (u,v) spacing (PS) is\nthe statistic that are used to categorize the source\nstructure properties of AGN.\nIn order to determine an unbiased RV versus PS distribution, we averaged the contributions of the 303 sources in the following manner. First, we included the 115 fully-reduced\nsources, Class=A, 48.1% of the sample. We contend that those sources not yet observed or reduced, Class=B, have the same average properties\nof those in Class=A. We included a representative\nportion of the 50 sources (Class = C) which were\ntoo resolved to be observed with HALCA but are\n\nColumn 8 gives the approximate brightness temperature for sources observed with VSOP.\nThese are calculated by taking the correlated\nflux density at the longest spacing observed\nfor the source, which is then converted to\nbrightness temperature in units of 1012 K.\n4 http://www.jaxa.jp/survey/survey\n\nThe Relative Visibility versus Projected Spacing\n\ndb.html\n5 http://www.physics.purdue.edu/\u223cmlister/MOJAVE/\n\n4\n\n\fnevertheless part of the VSOP AGN Sample. In\npractice we choose all 50, but reduced their weight\nin the analysis to 0.481 to match the portion of\nVSOP observations which have been observed and\nreduced by 2002 February.\nFig. 2 shows the dependence of the average RV\nversus PS for the sample. Although data from 165\nsources of the 303 in the sample are included, the\ndistribution should be representative of the entire\nsample, as described above. A preliminary version of this distribution, with fewer sources, was\npresented by Lovell et al. (2000). The distribution shows a strong decrease between 20 M\u03bb and\n140 M\u03bb, with a less steep decrease at longer spacings. At 500 M\u03bb, the RV is 20% of that at 20\nM\u03bb. Based on the measured total flux density of\nthe sources (see Table 1, col 3) the visibility amplitude at the first point at 20 M\u03bb is, on average,\nonly 52% of the total source flux density at zero\nprojected spacing. Thus, a typical AGN contains\nabout half of its emission in angular scales > 10\nmas which is invisible in the VLBA and VSOP observations, but contained in the total source flux\ndensity.\nFor comparison, the distribution from the\nVSOP observations of the Pearson-Readhead\n(PR) sample at 5 GHz (Lister et al. 2001a) is\nalso shown in Fig. 2. This sample of 27 sources\nis defined by \u03b4 > 35\u25e6 , total flux density > 1.3 Jy,\nwith correlated flux density > 0.4 Jy on a 6000 km\n(100 M\u03bb) baseline. Using the same visibility amplitude normalization as that used with the VSOP\nSurvey sample, the PR distribution is in reasonable agreement with that found with the VSOP\nsample. For the PR sample, there is smaller decrease of the RV for the longer spacings since the\nsample definition included a criterion concerning\nthe compactness of a source.\nThe distribution of the RV versus PS can be\ninterpreted as that produced by a typical AGN\nstructure. We have, thus, fit this distribution to an\naverage source structure, given by the dashed line\nin Fig. 2. For the space baselines of P S > 180 M \u03bb,\nthe distribution can be fit with a component of angular size 0.20 \u00b1 0.02 mas, containing 0.40 \u00b1 0.04%\nof the mas-scale flux density, or about 20% of the\ntotal flux density. The fit to shorter spacings is\nmore ambiguous, and a range of angular scale components are needed. Most of the emission is contained in an \u2248 1 mas-sized component, but some\n\nemission is required in a component of \u2248 2.4 mas\nto fit the shortest VLBA spacings. As described\nabove, a typical AGN contains even more extended\nemission with a scale size > 10 mas which is unobservable with the VLBA or VSOP, but have been\nimaged with lower frequency VLBI surveys.\nThe fit in Fig. 2 of the three components with\ndifferent angular scales is consistent with the\nknown structure of many AGNs: The smallest\nangular component is the radio core which is generally less than 1 mas in size. This component\nis associated with the inner part of the radio jet\nwhich is often beamed toward the observer. The\ntwo larger components are consistent with the radio jet and internal structures observed in many\nsources. The radio emission, which is completely\nresolved out in these observations, is associated\nwith larger-scale kpc-size emission. Since the\nstructure of most radio sources is asymmetric with\nthe radio core at one end of a linear structure, we\noriginally fit the data in Fig. 2 to an asymmetric spatial distribution of the three components.\nHowever, the fitting is insensitive to source asymmetry, but depends strongly on the component\nangular scales.\n4.\n4.1.\n\nThe Statistical Properties of Radio\nCores\nThe Angular Size Distribution\n\nEach plotted point in Fig. 2 represents the average RV for the set of sources. By fitting this RV\ndistribution to a typical AGN source model, we\nobtained an average source structure. In Fig. 3\nwe show the range of values for the RV associated with three spacings; 60 M\u03bb, 220 M\u03bb and 440\nM\u03bb, and the spread of these values is related to\nthe distribution of the angular size of the AGN\npopulation. At the shortest spacing of 60 M\u03bb,\nabout 60% of the sources are nearly unresolved\n(RV> 0.8), and about 12% of the sources have\nRV< 0.4. At the long spacing of 440 M\u03bb, nearly\n40% of the sources have RV< 0.2, and only about\n30% have RV> 0.4.\nIn order to determine the range of source sizes\nwhich are consistent with the distributions in\nFig. 3, we used the template structure of the threecomponent average source model. In other words,\nwe assumed that all sources have the same shape\nRV versus PS, but are scaled in angular size (or\n5\n\n\fspacing). We then convolved this template structure with a two-parameter log-normal distribution\nP (\u03b8), where \u03b8 is the angular size of the radio core,\n\u0010 log(\u03b8/\u03b8 ) \u00112\nl\nP (\u03b8)d\u03b8 \u221d exp \u2212\nd\u03b8,\nd\n\n4.2.\n\nThe Brightness Temperature Distribution\n\nThe brightness temperature distribution of the\ncore component in the observer's frame, Tb \u221d\nS/\u03b82 , can be derived from the angular size distributions given in Fig. 4, and the average core\nflux density, S. To obtain this core flux density, Fig. 5a shows a similar distribution to that\nof Fig. 2, but with the y-axis as the correlated\nflux density, rather than the RV. We have divided\nthe distribution into a low and a high redshift distribution, separated at z = 0.8 which is the redshift median value for the sample. Thus, the core\ncomponent, which becomes dominant at spacings\ngreater than 300 M\u03bb, has an average flux density\nof 0.5 Jy. The dependence of the core flux density with redshift is small, so that the assumption of converting the angular size distribution to\na brightness temperature distribution using a welldefined average core flux density of 0.5 Jy is valid.\nThe brightness temperature distributions in the\nobserver's reference frame are shown in Fig. 6,\nfor the best-fit angular size distribution and the\n'large-core' angular distribution. About 14% of\nthe sources have Tb > 1.0 \u00d7 1013 K for the best\nfit angular size distribution; whereas only 6% are\nabove this temperature for the large-core fit. For\nboth distribution, approximately half of all AGN\nhave a radio core with Tb > 1.0 \u00d7 1012 K. These\ndistributions agree well with that in Paper III derived from the images. Because our data modeling does not contain rigid cutoffs at the high resolution limit of the observations, but uses a reasonable extrapolation below the formal resolution\nlimit the VSOP observations, the distributions in\nFig. 6 extended to higher brightness temperatures\nthan that from other VLBI surveys of AGN. Our\naddition of AGN which were not observed with\nVSOP because of the lack of significant small-scale\nstructure also extends the brightness temperature\ndistributions to lower values than other VLBI surveys.\nTo correct the brightness temperature Tb from\nthe observer to the source reference frame, the factor (1 + z), where z is the source redshift, should\nbe applied to the brightness temperature. Fig. 5b\nshows the redshift distribution of the 267 sources\nin the sample with measured redshifts. The distribution is relatively flat out to z = 1.5, and\n\n(1)\n\nwith parameters \u03b8l , the log-mean of the angular\nsize distribution, and d, the dispersion in the log of\nthe angular size. The best fit for these two parameters was obtained by minimizing the \u03c72 difference\nbetween the observed distribution in Fig. 3 with\nthat expected from the template structure model,\nconvolved with the distribution in Eq. (1). The\nresult of this fit is a core size of \u03b8l = 0.052 mas\nand dispersion d = 1.45, and the fit is shown by\nthe dark plotted points in Fig. 3. The error bars\nrepresent the estimated error based on the number\nof sources used in each spacing range.\nThe cross-hatched histogram in Fig. 4 shows\nthe angular size distribution for this fit. Approximately 80% of the radio sources have a core angular size in the range 0.03 mas to 0.8 mas. (The two\nlarger radio components follow the same distribution, but are 5 and 12 times larger than the core.)\nAbout 14% and 4% of the sources may have an\nangular size less than 0.06 mas and 0.04 mas, respectively. Although the smaller angular sizes are\nclearly beyond the resolution capabilities of these\nobservations of about 0.15 mas for the stronger\ncores (Paper III), our assumption of reasonable\ncontinuity in the distribution of angular sizes, implied by the use of Eq. (1), does infer that these\nsmall angular size components are likely to exist.\nWe also fit the RV vs PS distribution in Fig. 3\nwith an angular size model which attempts to minimize the number of small sources. The fainter,\ncircle points show a fit to the data with parameters \u03b8l = 0.09 mas and d = 1.08. These values produce an additional \u03c72 deviation from the\ndata which makes this solution (or a more extreme\none) less than 15% as likely as a solution closer to\nthe best model. This angular distribution limit is\nshown by the open histogram in Fig. 4, where it\nis referred to as 'largest core'. For this distribution, the proportion of sources with cores with an\nangular diameter less than 0.06 mas has dropped\nfrom 14% to 6%, with only 1% less than 0.04 mas.\nThe difference between the two distributions is an\nindication of the model error.\n\n6\n\n\fTb > 1014 K (Kedziora-Chudczer et al. 2001). Of\nthe 710 sources surveyed with the VLA at 4.9\nGHz, the Micro-Arcsecond Scintillation-Induced\nVariability Survey (MASIV) (Lovell et al. 2003),\nabout 12% were classified as variable. The variability in the total flux density averaged about\n6%, and that the variable time scales varied from\na few hours to a few days. An approximate interpretation of these results is: about 12% of the\nAGNs contain a radio component with 6% of the\ntotal source flux density and Tb \u2265 1014 K. The\nresults from our statistical analysis suggests that\nabout 20% of the AGNs contain a radio component with 20% of the total source flux density and\nTb \u2265 1013 K. These two descriptions of the properties of the high brightness radio cores are compatible. Finally, a correlation between sources which\nscintillate and those which have relatively large\ncorrelated flux density observed by VSOP was reported by Lister, Tingay & Preston (2001b) using\nthe PR sample of sources. The detailed study of\nthe scintillation properties of the VSOP sample is\nin progress.\n\nthen drops off with a maximum redshift somewhat\nless than 3.0 for this sample. The average value\nof (1 + z) is 1.81. The plot in Fig. 5c shows a\ncomparison of the approximate source brightness\ntemperatures given in Table 1, col (8) versus redshift. There is clearly little systematic dependence\nof the brightness temperature with redshift, hence\na simple multiplication of the brightness temperature scale in Fig. 6 by 1.81 converts from the observer frame to the source frame. This assumption\nshould produce an error no larger than the 15%\ndifference in the average core flux density for high\nand low brightness sources, as shown in Fig. 5a.\nWe believe that the statistical analysis of the\nVSOP+VLBA observations gives the most realistic and unbiased estimate of the proportion of\nhigh brightness radio cores at 5 GHz yet available. In the source reference frame approximately\n25% of the radio cores have Tb > 1.0\u00d71013K using\nthe best fit angular size distribution, but this proportion drops to 16% for the largest core angular\nsize distribution. The proportion of the core with\nTb > 1.0 \u00d7 1014 K is 4% and 1% for the two distributions. This brightness temperature corresponds\nto a resolution which is a factor of 10 sharper than\nthe observed VSOP data, but we believe the percentages are reliable. Approximately 65% of the\nradio cores have Tb > 1.0 \u00d7 1012 K.\nThe above results are consistent with other surveys of compact radio sources. In the 15-GHz\nobservations of Kovalev et al. (2004), 18 of 160\nsources (13%) have Tb > 1.0 \u00d7 1013 K and 46%\nhave Tb > 1.0 \u00d7 1012 K. A 22 GHz survey (Moellenbrock et al. 1996) found a similar percentage of\nhigh brightness objects. Our percentage of cores\nwith Tb > 1.0 \u00d7 1012 K is in reasonable agreement\n(as it should be since the data overlap is large)\nwith the 53% found by Scott et al. (2004) from the\nimages and model-fitting of 102 sources from the\nVSOP Survey6 . The highest brightness temperatures that has been measured for an individual\nsource is 5.8 \u00d7 1013 K for AO0235+164 at 5 GHz\n(Frey et al. 2000).\nThe scintillation of many radio sources also\nimplies that they contain radio components with\n\n4.3.\n\nBrightness Temperature Modeling\n\nIt is generally assumed that the maximum\nbrightness temperature from a synchrotron emitting radio source is Tmax \u2248 1012 K, because\nthe strong inverse-Compton emission will quickly\nquench the radio emission above this brightness\n(Kellermann & Pauliny-Toth 1969; Lister et al.\n2001a; Tingay et al. 2001; Kellermann 2002). Calculations based on equipartion of energy arguments suggest that this limit may be as low as\n1010.5 K (Readhead et al. 1996). Other emission mechanisms have also been proposed, including relativistic induced Compton scattering\n(Sincell & Krolik 1994) and coherent synchrotron\nemission processes (Melrose 2002), which have a\nhigher brightness temperature limit. The observed\nbrightness temperatures above Tmax , however, can\nbe produced by the Doppler boosting (Shklovsky\n1963) of the emission from the radio core material\nwhich moves with a relativistic bulk velocity vb\nnearly in the direction to the observer, given by\nthe angle, \u03c8.\nIn order to obtain estimates of the three parameters, Tmax , \u03b2 = vb /c and \u03c8 needed to reproduce the high brightness tail of the distribution in\nFig. 6, we used the following simple model: The\n\n6 Twenty\n\nsources in the Scott sample are not included in this\nstatistical analysis because they were south of \u03b4 < \u221243, or\nnot within the strict definition of the catalog completeness.\nAbout 30 additional sources, with good visibility data, but\nnot yet imaged, are included this statistical analysis.\n\n7\n\n\fnumber density of the source brightness temperature, T < Tmax , is proportional to log(Tmax /T );\nthe motion of this material is \u03b2, and the maximum\norientation to the line of sight is \u03c8. For a more detailed modeling of superluminal sources, see Vermeulen & Cohen (1994). The plotted points in\nFig. 6 are those for the values Tmax = 1.0 \u00d7 1012K,\n\u03b2 = 0.993, \u03c8 = 35\u25e6 . Reasonable fits are obtained for the range 0.5 < Tmax < 2.0 and 0.990 <\n\u03b2 < 0.997. Similar model parameters are obtained\nfrom multi-epoch observations of the 'superluminal' motions of radio components, which suggest\n\u03b2 \u2248 0.99, corresponding to \u03b3 = (1 \u2212 \u03b2 2 )\u22120.5 \u2248 10\n(Vermeulen & Cohen 1994; Kellermann et al. 2000;\nKovalev et al. 2004).\n5.\n\nfore contained in a component > 10 mas in\nsize.\n\u2022 About 40% of the milliarcsec emission (20%\nof the total emission) comes from a radio\ncore of average size 0.20 \u00b1 0.02 mas.\n\u2022 About 80% of the radio cores have an angular size in the range of 0.03 to 0.8 mas. We\nestimate that 10\u00b14% of the cores are < 0.06\nmas at 5 GHz.\n\u2022 A majority of the AGN radio cores have a\nbrightness temperature in excess of 1.0\u00d71012\nK, and we estimate that 20 \u00b1 5% of the cores\nhave Tb > 1.0 \u00d7 1013K and 3 \u00b1 2% have Tb >\n1.0 \u00d7 1014 K in the source reference frame.\n\nConclusions\n\n\u2022 The derived brightness temperature distribution is in good agreement with the results from other high-resolution radio source\nsurveys and with radio scintillation observations.\n\nBefore the launch of HALCA, there was little\ndirect evidence concerning the brightness temperature distribution of radio components associated\nwith AGN. Figs. 2 and 3 show that at 5 GHz with\nbaselines up to 25,000 km there is significant emission for many AGNs, and future use of a spaceVLBI mission with substantially longer baselines\nare required to probe the evolution and structure\nof these high brightness radio cores. Future space\nVLBI missions with longer baselines and substantially improved sensitivity are, thus, required to\nprobe the evolution and structure of these high\nbrightness cores in AGNs.\nThe VSOP AGN Survey was compiled in order\nto determine the properties of the sub-mas radio\nstructure of strong AGN. The source sample covered the entire sky (|b| > 10\u25e6 ) and included sources\nat 5 GHz above 1 Jy, with a relatively flat spectral\nindex. No other criteria were used. The analysis\nin this paper provides an attempt at an unbiased\ndetermination of the radio source structure parameters by using the measured RV versus PS properties in a simple and straight-forward manner. An\nanalysis from the derived images and models of\nthe individual sources (Scott et al. 2004) obtains\nsimilar results on the angular size and brightness\ntemperature of the AGNs.\nThe major properties of AGN derived from the\nstatistical analysis described in this paper are:\n\nWe gratefully acknowledge the VSOP project,\nwhich is led by the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS, now called the Japan\nAerospace Exploration Agency, JAXA) in cooperation with many organizations and radio telescopes around the world.

The error estimate is based on the number of sources compiled for each point. The distribution for the Pearson-Readhead sample of 24\nsources is given by the open triangles. The dashed\nline shows the dependence of the relative visibility\nfor a three component model with component sizes\nand proportions as indicated. Each spacing bin is\n40 M\u03bb wide and not all bins were sampled for all\nsources. The maximum resolution for a source observed with VSOP varied between 300 to 540 M\u03bb,\nthe maximum resolution for VLBA observations\nwas 150 M\u03bb. At zero spacing, the average visibility is 1.95 times that at 20 M\u03bb. A spacing of 500\nM\u03bb corresponds to 25,000 km.\n\n400\n\nFig. 1.- Combining and Averaging the\nVSOP and VLBA Data: (a): The visibility\namplitude versus the projected spacing (u,v) is\nshown for the source J1626\u22122951. The VSOP\ndata at the longer spacings are shown by the\nfainter dots; the VLBA data at the shorter spacings are shown by the darker dots. These observations were taken nearly two years apart. (b): The\nsame plot as in (a) after correcting the VLBA amplitude scale, based on the measured variability of\nthe source. (c): Each point shows the average visibility amplitude and error estimate for all data\nwithin each interval of 40 M\u03bb projected spacing.\n\n11\n\n\fFig. 3.- The Fit to the Relative Visibility\nDistributions Versus Spacing: The histogram\nof the relative visibility for the sources in the sample are given for the three indicated spacings. The\nplotted points show the distribution from the template source model convolved with a core angularsize distribution shown in Fig. 3, using the parameters of Eq.(1). The error bars are estimated\nfrom the number of observations at each resolution. The lighter plotted points show a relatively\npoor fit associated with a model with a larger core\ndiameter (see text).\n\nFig. 4.- The Derived Core Angular-Size\nDistributions: The probability distribution of\nthe core angular size distribution with \u03b8l = 0.052\nmas and d = 1.45 (see Eq. (1)) is shown by the\ncross-hatched histogram, correspond to the darker\nplotted points in Fig. 3. The open histogram\nshows the distribution associated with the model\nfor a larger core, \u03b8l = 0.09 mas and d = 1.08,\nshown by the lighter plotted points in Fig. 3.\n\n12\n\n\f(a)\n\n(b)\n\n( )\n\nFig. 5.- (a) The Correlated Flux Density versus Projected Spacing for Sources in\nthe Sample: This plot is similar to Fig. 2, but\nwith the ordinate values in correlated flux density,\nrather than normalized to 1.0 at 20 M \u03bb. The sample was split into two nearly equal parts, defined\nby the source redshift. The higher redshift sample has about 15% less flux density at all spacings\nthan the lower redshift sample. (b) The Distribution of redshift: The number distribution\nfor the 277 of the 303 sources in the sample with a\nmeasured redshift. (c) The Dependence of the\nBrightness Temperature with Redshift: The\napproximate brightness temperatures, given in Table 1, Col (8) is plotted versus redshift if available.\nLittle core flux density versus redshift is observe;\nhence, the correction from the observer's frame to\nthe source frame by simply increasing the brightness temperature scale by 1.81 is valid.\n\nFig. 6.- The Brightness Temperature Distributions of the VSOP AGN Sample:\nThe brightness temperature distribution, implied\nby the core-angular size distributions, shown in\nFig. 3. The cross-hatched distribution is the best\nfit to the VSOP AGN sample; the open distribution is for the model with the larger core size. The\nplotted points at the high brightness temperature\ntails are shown for the model discussed in the text,\nwith vb /c = 0.993, Tmax = 1\u00d71012 K, and \u03c8 = 35\u25e6 .\n\n13\n\n\fTable 1\nVSOP
