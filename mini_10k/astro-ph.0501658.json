Point-symmetric\nPNe are thought to be shaped by stellar binary interactions; namely, the presence of\na companion to the PN's progenitor star is required.

A systematic cataloguing of highresolution images of the diffuse X-ray emission at the core of galaxy clusters might\ncontribute to individuate massive binary black holes.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn our hierarchical Universe, where small structures merge into larger ones,\nmassive binary black holes (i.e. with M = 108 \u2212 109 M\u2299 ) are believed to\nbe fairly common. Yet, up to now there is little compelling evidence of their\nexistence (Komossa, 2003; Merritt and Milosavlijevi\u0107, 2004). The strongest\ncandidate for a massive binary black hole (MBBH) are two X-ray active AGNs\nat the core of the nearby (z = 0.02) galaxy NGC 6240 observed with Chandra\n(Komossa et al., 2003). These AGNs are only 1.5 arcsec apart, and this hints\nthat the possibility for a \"direct\" detection of double AGNs is limited to very\nnearby objects. Other pieces of evidence are more indirect (Begelman et al.,\n1980, see also Komossa, 2003 for a recent review).\nThe history of a massive binary black hole may be summarised in the following\nsteps (Begelman et al., 1980; Merritt and Milosavlijevi\u0107, 2004; Roos, 1988):\n1) after two galaxies merge, the two massive black holes in the former galaxies'\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier Science\n\n26 October 2018\n\n\fnuclei sink into the gravitational well on account of the dynamical friction,\nand they eventually form a MBBH; 2) the binary orbit slowly decays, since\nthe interactions with field stars extract energy and angular momentum from\nthe binary system; 3) if the binary separation decreases enough, gravitational\nradiation takes over and the binary rapidly coalesces.\nThe centre of cool-core galaxy clusters is almost always occupied by a massive\ncD galaxy, formed by the mergers of several smaller galaxies (Dubinski, 1998).\ncD galaxies, therefore, seem the ideal environment to look for MBBHs.\nStep 1 is quite fast, while the passage from phase 2 to phase 3 may take\na very long time (Merritt and Milosavlijevi\u0107, 2004). Therefore, many MBBH\nare expected to lie in the intermediate phase 2, where their separation is still\ntoo large to allow a significant gravitational radiation emission, but where the\nmutual gravitational interaction is strong enough to spark interesting phenomena.\nIn this paper we discuss the possibility to detect MBBH at the core of galaxy\nclusters from a morphological analysis of their X-ray emission. Our method\nis based on an analogy between the morphology of the diffuse X-ray emission\nat the core of some galaxy clusters, and similar structures observed in the\noptical emission of some planetary nebulae (PNe) (Soker, 2003a,b, 2004). This\nsimilarity suggests that a common physical mechanism lies at the origin of\nthese structures. We argue that this common mechanism is the gravitational\naction of a binary system.\n\n2\n\nPoint-Symmetric Bubbles in Planetary Nebulae\n\nSolar-sized stars loose their outer envelope during the Asymptotic Giant Branch\n(AGB) phase, after they quit the main sequence. The lost shell is ionised by\nthe leftover central white dwarf, and shines as a PN. Actually, only 10% of all\nPNe are spherically symmetric (Soker, 1992); most of them are axisymmetric,\nor even completely asymmetric, with a wide spectrum of morphologies. Here\nwe focus on bipolar PNe, which exhibit two lobes and an equatorial waist\nbetween them. A prototype of this kind of PNe is Hb 5, shown in Figure 1.\nPoint-symmetry is another feature of this nebula. As in geometry, a structure\nis said to be point-symmetric if, to each substructure, a similar substructure\ncorresponds on the opposite side with respect to the centre. In general, point\nsymmetry does not imply neither mirror symmetry nor axial symmetry.\nA pair of optically faint lobes is also apparent in this object, as well as in others\nPNe. The inner regions of the lobes are optically faint on account of their low\ndensity, which is about 2-3 orders of magnitude below the surroundings (Soker,\n2\n\n\f2003b).\nThe formation of bipolar PNe and point-symmetric structures can be explained by the influence of a binary companion (Soker, 2004). The AGB wind\nfrom the primary star forms an accretion disc around a secondary compact\nstar; in turn, this accretion disc launches jets and/or collimated fast winds into\nthe PN shell. If the jet orientation remains constant in time, the PN should\npossess a pure axisymmetrical structure. The bright pattern is different if the\njets precess, however. During the precession motion the jets expand in a pointsymmetric geometry centred on the PN core, hence inflating point-symmetric\nbubble pairs.\nWhat is the cause of this precession? If the jet is fired by an accretion disc, the\njet's precession is a direct consequence of the disc's own precession. Different\nmechanisms may be able to drive it.\nThe first one is the action of a companion star, which makes the disc precess\nat a rate (Katz, 1997)\n\u03c9prec \u2243 0.4\n\n\u0012\n\nGM\na3\n\n\u00131/2 \u0012\n\nad\na\n\n\u00133/2\n\nq\ncos \u03b8,\n(1 + q)1/2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere q = M2 /M1 , M1 is the mass of the accreting object, M2 is the mass of\nthe mass-loosing component, M = M1 + M2 is the mass of the binary system,\na is the separation between the components (assuming a circular orbit), ad\nis the disc's radius, and \u03b8 is the tilt angle between the disc and the orbital\nplane. Normalising to values typical for a stellar binary system, the precession\nperiod \u03c4prec = 2\u03c0/\u03c9prec is\n\u03c4prec \u2243 10\n\n3\n\nyr\n\nM\n2 M\u2299\n\n!1/2 \u0012\n\na\n1014 cm\n\n\u00133 \u0012\n\nad\n1013 cm\n\n\u0013\u22123/2\n\n(1 + q)1/2\n. (2)\nq cos \u03b8\n\nA second possible scenario is that the PN's progenitor is a single star. In this\ncase, the mechanism driving the jet's precession is a disc's intrinsic instability,\nwhich warps the disc (Pringle, 1997) and wobbles the jet's direction on a time\nscale of hundreds of years (Livio and Pringle, 1997). The two mechanisms\npredict similar precession time-scales, which are few times smaller than a\ntypical PN's age. This allows few precessions in total, enough to produce the\nobserved point-symmetric structure.\nEven if both mechanisms predict the same time-scale for precession, there is\na potential important difference between the two models, which will turn out\nto be important when we shall extend this model to galaxy clusters. The selfinduced warping instability causes the accretion disc to wobble in a stochastic\n3\n\n\fmanner (Pringle, 1997; Livio and Pringle, 1997). In such a case we expect that\nthe signature will be a point-symmetric nebula, but with no global axisymmetry. Such nebulae might have a morphology resembling that of the PN He 2-47\n(see Figure 3, from Sahai, 2000), and to less extent that of the PN M1-37\n(Sahai, 2000). We point out that a model based on a stellar binary system\nat the centre of each of these two PNe can also account for their structure.\nIn any case, we do not expect that the self-induced warping instability will\nlead to a nice global axisymmetric structure - besides the point-symmetric\nbrightness - as in the PN Hb 5 (Figure 1).\n\n3\n\nA Generalisation to Galaxy Clusters\n\nIn this Section we extend this physical picture to the X-ray cavities in galaxy\nclusters. The last generation X-ray satellites Chandra and XMM-Newton have\nrevealed the presence of X-ray deficient bubble pairs in the diffuse medium\nof several cooling flow clusters of galaxies. (e.g. Hydra A: McNamara et al.\n(2000); Perseus: Fabian et al. (2000, 2003); A 2597: McNamara et al. (2001);\nA 4059: Heinz et al. (2002); RBS 797: Schindler et al. (2001); A 2052 Blanton et al.\n(2003)). These X-ray cavities also harbour a relevant radio emission, owing to\nsynchrotron radiation. It is generally accepted that these cavities are associated to the activity of an AGN sitting at the cluster centre. Its outbursts\nmay inject a sizeable amount of energy (1057 \u2212 1060 erg) into the diffuse intracluster medium (ICM). Magnetic fields and hot, possibly relativistic, plasma\ndisplace the dense ICM, leaving over thin and X-ray faint cavities. The absence of strong shocks at the rims of essentially all these cavities shows that\nthe ICM displacement is quite gentle (McNamara, 2004).\nIn some cases the diffuse X-ray emission near these cavities exhibits a pointsymmetric structure. An example is the recently observed galaxy cluster MS 0735.6+7421,\nwhose Chandra image was first presented at the 2004 COSPAR meeting\n(McNamara et al., 2005, see also Figure 2). This is a faraway (z \u2243 0.2) cluster, thus even with Chandra its angular resolution is rather poor. To better\nappreciate the analogies with point-symmetric nebulae, we compare it to a\nlow-resolution image of the point-symmetric nebula Hb 5 (Figure 1, right\npanel). Both structures have similar point-symmetries: as discussed above, if\nwe suppose they are due to a precessing jet, the regular morphology hints in\nboth cases for a binary-driven precession, rather than for a stochastic precession \u00e0 la Pringle. Even in this case, the morphological criterion is the only\ndiscriminant, because the precession time scales predicted by the two models\nare similar:\n\u03c4prec \u2243 2 \u00d7 107 yr \u03b1\u22121\n\nM\n,\nM\u2299\n\n109\n\n4\n\n(3)\n\n\ffor Pringle's model (equation (4.11) of Pringle (1997); \u03b1 is the celebrated\nShakura and Sunyaev (1973) alpha-parameter), and\n6\n\n\u03c4prec \u2243 10 yr\n\nM\n9\n10 M\u2299\n\n!1/2 \u0012\n\na\n1019 cm\n\n\u00133 \u0012\n\nad\n1018 cm\n\n\u0013\u22123/2\n\n(1 + q)1/2\n.(4)\nq cos \u03b8\n\nfor the binary model. For a typical mass ratio q = 0.1, the precession period is \u03c4prec \u2243 107 yr, close to the value predicted by the warp-instability\nmodel. Both the estimated precession time scales are few times smaller than\nthe estimated lifetime of the jet activity \u2243 108 yr (McNamara, 2004), allowing\nfew precession in total. We conclude this Section with a caveat. A precessing\nopposite-jet model may explain quite naturally a point-symmetric structure\nlike in MS 0735.6+7421, because it can influence symmetrically both sides of\nthe cluster's centre. Yet, alternative explanations are by no way ruled out.\nHigh resolution X-ray imaging, stellar dynamics analysis, detailed radio observations are required to weed out the spurious candidates.\n\n4\n\nSummary and Conclusion\n\nIn this paper we have been guided by the occurrence of point-symmetric structures both in the X-ray deficient bubbles in some galaxy clusters and in optical\ndeficient bubbles in bipolar planetary nebulae. We have pointed out that the\nultimate origin of these symmetric structures might be binary-driven precession of the jets inflating the bubble pairs. If this hypothesis is correct, the\ngalaxy cluster MS 0735.6+7421 should harbour a massive binary black hole\nat its centre.\nWe may look ahead beyond the special case of MS 0735.6+7421, and suggest\nthat a systematic cataloguing of point-symmetric X-ray structures in galaxy\nclusters might increase the number of candidate MBBHs. For this task a high\nangular resolution is necessary. Chandra is suitable for that task, and in the\nfuture more candidates are to be expected in the XEUS sky.\n\nThe initial part of this research was motivated by discussions with Mordechai\nRorvig.
