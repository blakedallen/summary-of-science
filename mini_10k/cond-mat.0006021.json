Linear spin-wave theory predicts no dispersion on the line\nconnecting these momenta. Our calculations show that in fact the magnon energy at (\u03c0, 0) is 10%\nlower than at (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2). We also discuss the transverse and longitudinal multi-magnon continua\nand their relevance to neutron scattering experiments.\nPACS: 75.40.Gb, 75.40.Mg, 75.10.Jm, 75.30.Ds\n\nIt is now well established that the spin-wave theory\nof the two-dimensional Heisenberg model [1] correctly\ndescribes the low-energy dynamics of layered antiferromagnets such as La2 CuO4 [2,3]. Several methods have\nbeen used to calculate the quantum renormalization factor Z of the spin wave velocity, c = Zc0 , with the result\nZ \u2248 1.18 for S = 1/2 [4\u20138]. Early neutron scattering experiments were consistent with this renormalization over\nthe entire Brilloin zone [9]. However, recently more accurate measurements have shown clear deviations at high\nenergies in La2 CuO4 [10] and other materials [11]. In\nparticular, spin-wave theory predicts no dispersion on\nthe magnetic zone boundary, i.e., along the line of momenta q = (\u03c0 \u2212 x, x), whereas the experimental data\nshow a significant variation in the excitation energy. This\ncould be caused by interactions other than the nearestneighbor super-exchange J normally used to model the\nmaterials [10,12]. The deviations could also be at least\npartially due to a failure of low-order spin-wave theory\nto account for the high-energy dynamics of the Heisenberg model. A series expansion calculation [13] indeed\nindicates a momentum dependent renormalization factor, with the magnon energy at q = (\u03c0, 0) approximately\n7% lower than at (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2). This, however, is opposite\nto the trend found experimentally for La2 CuO4 [10].\nAnother important issue, that has not yet been confronted experimentally, is the multi-magnon continuum\nexpected to be present in the dynamic structure factor\nS(q, \u03c9) above the single-magnon mode. The neutron\nscattering cross-section has been analyzed assuming only\na delta-function representing the spin waves with dispersion \u03c9q [2,9\u201311]. The resolution of present experiments\nis not sufficient for detecting the presence of additional\nspectral weight, much less to determine its distribution.\nTheoretical calculations have so far also not been successful in accurately determining the full dynamic structure\nfactor. In order to provide guidance for improved fitting\nprocedures it is imperative to obtain quantitative estimates of the multi-magnon spectral features, in particu-\n\nlar considering that experiments may soon become sufficiently accurate for detecting the continuum. Within\nspin-wave theory, correctly accounting for the interactions that give rise to the continuum is extremely complicated and has led to contradictory results [6,14,15].\nNumerical calculations of S(q, \u03c9) are challenging because\nlarge lattices have to be used to converge to the thermodynamic limit, and the extraction of real-time dynamics\nfrom quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) data is difficult. Such\ncalculations have therefore so far only given limited insights [16,17]. The series work [13] suggests a significant\ncontinuum but gives no information on its shape.\nHere we address the issues of high-energy magnon dispersion and multi-magnon continuum using QMC calculations in a way that explicitly separates the transverse\nand longitudinal components of the dynamic structure\nfactor. This allows us to more accurately determine both\nthe magnon energy and the continuum part of the spectrum. We consider the Heisenberg model on a square\nlattice, defined in standard notation by the Hamiltonian\nX\nSi * Sj .\n(1)\nH=J\nhi,ji\n\nThe coupling J \u2248 1500 K in typical planar cuprates.\nOn an infinite lattice the spin-rotational symmetry of\nthis model is spontaneously broken at T = 0 and longrange order develops along an axis that we take as the\nz-direction. The two-point correlations then have different longitudinal (z) and transverse (x, y) components.\nIn a finite system the symmetry is not broken and all\ncorrelation functions are equal to the same rotational average. We want to access separately the transverse dynamic structure factor, which contains the single-magnon\nmode as well as a continuum, and the longitudinal component comprising only a multi-magnon continuum. To\nthis end, we explicitly break the symmetry by applying\na staggered magnetic field;\nX\n(2)\n(\u22121)xi +yi Siz .\nH \u2192H \u2212h\ni\n\n1\n\n\fWe adjust the field strength h so that the induced staggered magnetization equals the known value in the thermodynamic limit; m = |hSiz i| = 0.307 [18,19,5\u20138]. In the\nlimit of large system sizes h \u2192 0 (at T = 0) and the\ncorrelation functions become equal to their values in a\nsystem with spontaneously broken symmetry.\nIn real layered cuprates there is a small inter-layer coupling and some degree of anisotropy, resulting in a finiteT transition to an ordered state, in La2 CuO4 at TN \u2248 300\nK. We here consider a low temperature, \u03b2 = J/T = 32,\ncorresponding to approximately 50 K, where the staggered magnetization in real materials is very close to the\nsaturated T = 0 value. Our staggered field h can then\nalso be viewed as a mean-field treatment of the inter-layer\ncoupling [20].\nWorking with lattices with N = L \u00d7 L spins and periodic boundary conditions, we have used the stochastic\nseries expansion method [21] to calculate the imaginarytime dependent spin-spin correlation function\nG\u03b1 (q, \u03c4 ) = hS \u03b1 (\u2212q, \u03c4 )S \u03b1 (q, 0)i,\n\n\u03c7\u03b1 (q) =\n\n\u03b2\n\nd\u03c4 G\u03b1 (q, \u03c4 ).\n\n(8)\n\n0\n\nThe spectrum also obeys the bosonic relation\nS\u03b1 (q, \u2212\u03c9) = e\u2212\u03b2\u03c9 S\u03b1 (q, \u03c9).\nFor the model forms of the transverse and longitudinal structure factors we take simple functions that reflect\nthe expected gross spectral features. The transverse component should include a delta-function at an energy \u03c9q ,\nrepresenting the magnon, and a continuum that does not\nextend below \u03c9q (temperature broadening of the highenergy magnons should be insignificant at \u03b2 = 32). The\nlongitudinal component is entirely in the continuum and\ncan also not extend below \u03c9q . Both continua must decay\nto zero rapidly as \u03c9 \u2192 \u221e, to ensure convergence of all\nfrequency moments. We use\nSx (q, \u03c9) = A1 (q)\u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9q ) + A2 (q)fx (q, \u03c9),\nSz (q, \u03c9) = B(q)fz (q, \u03c9),\n\n(9)\n(10)\n\nwhere the continua fx,z (q, \u03c9) are given by\n\n(3)\n\nfx (q, \u03c9) = rx e\u2212(\u03c9\u2212\u03bd)\n\nwhere \u03b1 = x, z and\n1 X \u2212q*ri \u2212\u03c4 H \u03b1 \u03c4 H\ne\nSi e .\ne\nS a (q, \u03c4 ) = \u221a\nN i\n\nZ\n\n2\n\n/2\u03c32\n\n, (0 for \u03c9 < \u03c9q ),\n\np \u2212a(\u03c9\u2212\u03c9q )b\n\nfz (q, \u03c9) = rz (\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9q ) e\n\n(4)\n\n(11)\n\n, (0 for \u03c9 < \u03c9q ), (12)\n\nwhere rx and rz are factors normalizing the frequency\nintegrals to unity. For clarity, we have suppressed the\ndependence of the parameters \u03bd, \u03c3, p, a, and b on q. The\nstatic structure factors (the integrated spectral weights)\nare given by\n\nThe correlation function is related to the dynamic structure factor according to\nZ\n1 \u221e\nG\u03b1 (q, \u03c4 ) =\nd\u03c9S\u03b1 (q, \u03c9)e\u2212\u03c4 \u03c9 ,\n(5)\n\u03c0 \u2212\u221e\n\nSx (q) = hS x (\u2212q)S x (q)i = A1 (q) + A2 (q),\nSz (q) = hS z (\u2212q)S z (q)i = B(q).\n\nwhich in principle can be inverted to yield the realfrequency dynamics from the correlation function computed in the simulations. With simulation data affected\nby statistical fluctuations there are well known difficulties in carrying out this analytic continuation in practice,\nand one can only expect limited frequency resolution using, e.g., the maximum entropy method [22]. Here we will\ninstead assume reasonable functional forms for the transverse (x) and longitudinal (z) dynamic structure factors,\nwith parameters that are adjusted to satisfy the equality\n(5). With the QMC method used, derivatives of G\u03b1 (q, \u03c4 )\ncan also be directly calculated [23] and impose additional\nconstraints on S\u03b1 (q, \u03c9); from Eq.

The rotationally averaged static structure factor S(q) = 2Sx (q) + Sz (q) =\n2A1 + 2A2 + B.\nThe values we find for the \"self-consistent\" staggered\nfield (demanding m = 0.3070 to an accuracy of better\nthan 0.00005) are h/J = 0.10652 for L = 4, 0.022575 for\nL = 8, 0.005450 for L = 16, and 0.001615 for L = 32.\nWith the QMC algorithm [21] implemented in the zbasis, and with the field also in the z-direction, the longitudinal correlations can be easily calculated. In order\nto compute the transverse correlations it is more efficient\nto apply the field in the x-direction, so that the measurements can be carried out with diagonal operators [24].\nHence, we perform two independent simulations for each\nlattice size.\nFig. 1 shows our results for the ratio of the longitudinal\nand transverse spectral weights versus the momentum,\nalong a standard path in the Brilloin zone. At q = (\u03c0, \u03c0)\nthe ratio diverges (in the thermodynamic limit), reflecting the divergence of Sz (\u03c0, \u03c0) due to the long-range order.\n\nWe use the first (n = 1) and (n = 2) second derivatives,\nwhich at \u03c4 = 0 correspond to the first two frequency\nmoments of the spectrum. We also use the sum rule\nZ\n2 \u221e d\u03c9\nS\u03b1 (q, \u03c9),\n(7)\n\u03c7\u03b1 (q) =\n\u03c0 \u2212\u221e \u03c9\nwhere \u03c7\u03b1 (q) is the static susceptibility\n2\n\n\f0.90\n\n0.6\n\n0.85\n\n0.5\n\n0.80\n\nA1/(A1+A2)\n\nSz(q)/Sx(q)\n\n0.7\n\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n\n(a)\n\n0.75\n0.70\n0.65\n\nq=(\u03c0,0)\n\n0.60\n\nq=(\u03c0/2,\u03c0/2)\n\n0.55\n0.0\n(\u03c0/2,\u03c0/2) (\u03c0,\u03c0)\n\n(\u03c0,0) (\u03c0/2,\u03c0/2) (0,0)\n\n2.60\n\n(\u03c0,0)\n\n(b)\n\nq\n\n2.50\n\n\u03c9q\n\nFIG. 1. Ratio of the longitudinal and transverse static\nstructure factors (integrated spectral weights) along a path\nin the Brilloin zone. Open circles are for L = 16 and solid\nones for L = 32.\n\n2.40\n2.30\nq=(\u03c0,0)\n\nFor q \u2192 (0, 0) and q \u2192 (\u03c0, \u03c0) it approaches zero and\nhence the magnon completely exhausts the total spectral\nweight in these limits (other treatments have shown that\nthe magnon exhausts the low-energy transverse spectral\nweight [25]). The ratio is the largest at q = (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2)\nwhere it is above 0.7 - it is between 0.6 and 0.7 over\nmuch of the Brilloin zone. Hence, in unpolarized neutron\nscattering experiments, 30 \u2212 35% of the cross-section at\nthe zone boundary is due to the longitudinal continuum.\nNext we study the full dynamic structure factor, focusing on the zone-boundary momenta q = (\u03c0, 0) and\n(\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2). The analytic continuation using fits to the\nfunctions (9) and (10) was carried out using QMC\nimaginary-time data with a spacing \u2206\u03c4 = 0.5 up to \u03c4 = 4\n(the data become too noisy for higher \u03c4 ). For L = 4,\nwe have compared with exact diagonalization results and\nfind that the magnon energy is very accurately reproduced (better than 0.5%) but the weight in the magnon\nis underestimated by about 5% because the form of the\ncontinuum, Eq. (11), is not appropriate for a very small\nsystem where only a small number of significant deltafunctions represent the continuum. Our results for larger\nsystems should have smaller systematic errors.\nFig. 2 shows the size dependence of the magnon weight\nand energy (the scatter of the data gives an indication of\nthe statistical errors). The L = 4 data is from exact diagonalization; in this case the two momenta are degenerate\ndue to equivalence of this lattice and a 24 hyper-cube.\nRough extrapolations in 1/L give the infinite-size energy\n\u03c9q /J \u2248 2.15 for q = (\u03c0, 0) and 2.39 for (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2). The\nrelative weight of the magnon in Sx (q, \u03c9) is \u2248 60% at\n(\u03c0, 0) and 85% at (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2). Within linear spin-wave\ntheory, including the quantum-renormalization Z = 1.18,\nthe energy \u03c9q /J = 2.36 for both momenta. Hence, the\nresults show that the interactions neglected in spin-wave\ntheory have strong effects at q = (\u03c0, 0), lowereing the\nenergy by almost 10% and transferring \u2248 40% of the\n\n2.20\n2.10\n0.00\n\nq=(\u03c0/2,\u03c0/2)\n\n0.05\n\n0.10\n\n0.15\n1/L\n\n0.20\n\n0.25\n\nFIG. 2.

At (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2) the\nexcitation energy is instead slightly increased by the interactions and a much smaller fraction of the weight is in\nthe continuum.\nFig. 3 shows the magnon as well as the transverse and\nlongitudinal continua for L = 32. The rotationally averaged structure factor measured in neutron scattering experiments with unpolarized neutrons is also shown. The\nexponent p in the longitudinal continuum, Eq. (12), is\nsmall and positive, p <\n\u223c 0.05, giving a spectral weight\nconcentrated close to the magnon. The longitudinal continuum is significantly narrower at (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2) than at\n(\u03c0, 0). For both momenta, the transverse continuum is\nbroad and centered further above the magnon. All these\nspectral features are consistently present for system sizes\nL \u2265 8. As seen in the insets of Fig. 3, for L = 32 only\n\u2248 45% of the rotationally averaged spectral weight is\nin the magnon mode at (\u03c0, 0), increasing to \u2248 65% at\n(\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2). The magnon weight decreases only slightly\nfor even larger systems, as can be inferred from Fig. 2.\nIn previous work using QMC and analytic continuation [16,17], the magnon energy was extracted as the first\nmoment of the rotationally averaged relaxation function,\nF (q, \u03c9) \u223c S(q, \u03c9)/\u03c9. Using this procedure, we find the\nmoment 2.53 at (\u03c0, 0) and 2.58 at (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2), i.e., both\nsignificantly above the actual magnon energies (the first\n3\n\n\fmoment of S(q, \u03c9) is higher yet; approximately 2.66 for\nboth momenta). This is clearly due to the large spectral\nweight in the continuum. There is potentially a similar problem in the analysis of neutron scattering data.\nSince the present-day energy resolution is such that a\nnon-negligible part of the continuum that we have found\nhere would be included in an experimental fit to a single\nresolution-broadened peak, the extracted magnon energy\nmay be too high. This effect would be particularly important at and close to q = (\u03c0, 0), where our results show\nthat less than 50% of the total weight is in the magnon\npeak and the continuum is relatively broad.\nExperimental results do appear to show the presence of\nsome weight consistent with a continuum above the resolutioned broadened magnon peak [10], but the statistics\nis not sufficient for extracting its size and shape. Our\ncalculations should be useful for analyzing future experiments with higher resolution. Such experiments will be\nvery important for determining the significance of other\ninteractions in the antiferromagnetic cuprates beyond the\nnearest-neighbor exchange J. The significant effects of\nmagnon interactions that we have found at q = (\u03c0, 0)\nmay also have important consequences for the broadening of the Raman spectrum [15] and the momentum space\nanisotropy of the photoemission spectrum [26].\nWe would like to thank G.
