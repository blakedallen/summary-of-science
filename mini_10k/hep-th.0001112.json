As an example, we re onsider\nthe problem of stabilizing the dilaton in a non-perturbative potential indu ed\nby gaugino\n\nondensates.\n\nA well-known di\u001e ulty is that the potential is so\n\nsteep that the dilaton \u001celd tends to overrun the\nevolve to an observationally una\noupling to the kineti\n\norre t minimum and to\n\neptable va uum. We show that the dilaton\n\nor thermal energy of matter \u001celds produ es a natural\n\nme hanism for gently relaxing the dilaton \u001celd into the\nthe potential without \u001cne-tuning of initial\n\norre t minimum of\n\nonditions. The same me hanism\n\nis potentially relevant for stabilizing other moduli \u001celds.\n\nA fundamental problem in supergravity and superstring theories is the stabilization of\nmoduli \u001celds, parti ularly the dilaton. Perturbatively,\n\n\u03a6 \u2261 exp(\u03bb\u03c6)\n\n(the dilaton) has no\n\npotential, although it does not behave as a free \u001celd be ause it has non-linear ouplings to the\n\n1\n\n\fkineti\n\n\u03a6 and \u03c6 inter hangeably\n\u221a\nonstant \u03bb =\n16\u03c0/mpl , where mpl \u2261\n\nenergy of the axion \u001celd.

It appears that, unless the initial\n\nonditions of the dilaton \u001celd are \u001cnely-tuned to lie very near the\n\norre t minimum, the\n\n\u001celd will overrun or miss altogether the desired minimum.\nIn this paper, we present a possible robust solution to this problem based on generi\nproperties of the dilaton and natural\nof the dilaton to the kineti\n\nosmologi al e\u001be ts. The solution relies on the\n\noupling\n\nenergy density of ordinary matter \u001celds whi h has important\n\nonsequen es in the early universe when the thermal (kineti ) energy density is high. In the\nradiation-dominated epo h, at least three e\u001be ts\n\nome into play, two of whi h have been\n\nonsidered previously.\nFirst, the energy density in the thermal\n\nomponent in reases the Hubble damping, as\n\nemphasized by Barreiro et al [6\u2104. If the thermal energy density is very large\n\nompared to\n\nthe dilaton energy density, the Hubble damping fa tor is signi\u001c antly enhan ed and the\nevolution of the dilaton is slowed. As a result,\nvalues ( orresponding to\nstill be trapped at\n\n\u03a6min .\n\n\u03a6\n\nan be allowed somewhat smaller initial\n\nlimbing further up the steep part of the potential in Fig. 1) and\nThis is a modest expansion in allowed initial\n\ns heme presented here, we \u001cnd that the range of allowed initial\n\nonditions. In the\n\nonditions is enormously\n\nexpanded.\nSe ond, as pointed out by Horne and Moore [7\u2104, the dilaton\naxion \u001celd and, if both \u001celds have large initial kineti\npotential, the non-linear\n\noupling\n\nauses\n\n\u03a6\n\nto undergo\n2\n\nouples non-linearly to the\n\nenergy densities\nhaoti\n\nompared to their\n\nmotion ba k and forth in its\n\n\fpotential over a \u001cnite range in\n\n\u03a6 that in\n\nludes the desired minimum. If the\n\nould be sustained, then this would enhan e the probability that\n\nThis paper points out a third feature of the dilaton in a\n\nbehavior\n\n\u03a6 is trapped in the\n\nminimum. However, as pointed out by Banks et al [8\u2104, the axion kineti\nqui kly and spatial inhomogeneities grow too rapidly during the\n\nhaoti\n\nhaoti\n\nenergy de ays too\nphase.\n\nosmologi al setting that\n\nprovide a robust me hanism for dilaton stabilization. Namely, although the dilaton\nnon-perturbatively to itself, it\n\norre t\n\nouples perturbatively to the kineti\n\nan\n\nouples\n\nenergy and potential\n\nenergy of all matter and gauge \u001celds. In studying va uum solutions, these \u001celds and their\nkineti\n\nenergies are usually set to zero. However, in a\n\na non-negligible, temperature-dependent\n\nosmologi al setting, they produ e\n\nontribution to the dilaton e\u001be tive potential that\n\nan allow the dilaton \u001celd to be gently lowered into the desired minimum as the universe\nexpands and\ndilaton\n\nools. Whether this me hanism works depends on the fun tional form of the\n\noupling to the matter and radiation energy densities. If we take forms suggested by\n\nsuperstring theory, the s enario works. (When the \u001crst two e\u001be ts above, Hubble damping\nand\n\noupling to the axion, are also in luded, they help to extend the range of dilaton\n\nouplings whi h work.)\nWe write the lowest omponent of dilaton super\u001celd as\nthe dilaton and\ngaugino\n(\u03a6\n\nA the axion.\n\nS = \u03a6+iA/mpl , where \u03a6 des\n\nThe non-perturbative dilaton potential,\n\nondensates, arranged to yield a stable minimum with zero\n\n= \u03a6min ):\n\nVnp , is due to multiple\nosmologi al\n\nonstant\n\nthe ra etra k model [4\u2104 as shown in Fig. 1.
