It has been found out that theories even formulated\nas pure closed-strings have open-string sectors which can be described as\nboundary states. One of the most important features of such open-closed\nmixed systems is a duality between open- and closed-strings. This duality\nbecomes manifest, for instance, by seeing one-loop diagrams of open-string\nas tree propagations of closed-string through modular transformations on\nthe string world-sheets. In the systems of D-branes, this duality should be\na rationale for correspondence between gauge theory on the world-volumes\n(open-string sector) and gravity theory in the bulk space-time (closed-string\nsector). AdS/CFT correspondence may be regarded as one of the most remarkable examples of such bulk-boundary correspondence (see for example\n[1] for a review along these lines).\nIt is well-known that the so called boundary states provide a description\nof D-branes in closed string theory. Open and closed strings interact on the\nbranes in space-time and therefore boundary states can be used to describe\nthese interactions. In [2] this was achieved for tachyons and gluons in a non\ncompact spacetime with a constant B field background while in [3] for all\nopen states in a compact spacetime without background fields.\nOn the other hand intersecting branes on tori have been used as a building\nblock for constructing (semi)realistic versions of the standard model (see for\nexample [5, 6] for reviews). This construction requires considering branes\nwith non trivial homology in presence of both open and closed background\nfields since the geometric embedding of these branes is governed by these\n\"parameters\", i.e. background fields values.\nIn this article we want to build boundary states for bosonic boundary\nstates describing branes with non trivial homology on tori in presence of\nconstant open and closed background fields (see also [7, 8, 9, 10] for related\nconstruction). This paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we fix our conventions and review the closed string quantization on a torus in presence of\nbackground fields and the action of T-duality. In this section we describe also\nthe quantization of open string describing homologically non trivial branes\nin this closed background in presence of a constant magnetic field. In section\n3 we proceed to construct the boundary states for the D25 brane: we find\nthat it is necessary to introduce non physical \"twisted\" states to accomplish\nthis task. In section 4 we discuss the action of T-duality on these states from\n1\n\n\fthe closed string point of view and we sketch how this can be derived from\nthe open string point of view ( see [4] for more details) Finally in section 5\nwe draw our conclusions.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nReview of quantization of string and Tduality.\nThe quantization of closed string in a constant G\nand B background.\n\nIn order to fix our notation and conventions we start writing the usual action\nfor the closed string\nZ \u03c0\n\u0010\u221a\n\u0011\n1 Z\n\u03b1\u03b2\n\u03bc\n\u03bd\n\u03b1\u03b2\n\u03bc\n\u03bd\nd\u03c4\nd\u03c3\n\u2212gg\nG\n\u2202\nX\n\u2202\nX\n\u2212\n\u01eb\nB\n\u2202\nX\n\u2202\nX\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03b1\n\u03b2\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03b1\n\u03b2\n4\u03c0\u03b1\u2032\n0\nZ\nZ \u03c0\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\u0011\n1\n\u03bc \u2032\u03bd\n\u03bc \u03bd\n\u2032\u03bc \u2032\u03bd\nd\u03c4\nd\u03c3\nG\n\u2212\n2B\n\u1e8a\nX\n\u1e8a\n\u1e8a\n\u2212\nX\nX\n=\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03bc\u03bd\n4\u03c0\u03b1\u2032\n0\n\nS = \u2212\n\nwhere we have chosen the conformal gauge g\u03b1\u03b2 \u221d \u03b7\u03b1\u03b2 = diag(\u22121, 1) and\nchosen \u01eb01 = \u22121.

Notice that we write this and all following expressions as if we used\na generic matrix W even if we actually use W = diag(W 1 , W 2 , . . . , W d ). By\nthis we mean that the fields living on the branes must have that periodicity,\nfor example in the case of tachyons this means T(0) (x0 , xi ) = T(0) (x0 , xi +\n2\u03c0Wji sj ) with x = X(0, \u03c4 ), T(\u03c0) (x0 , xi ) = T(\u03c0) (x0 , xi + 2\u03c0Wji sj ) with x =\nX(\u03c0, \u03c4 ).

To explore this point let us consider the simplest case where\nonly F12 6= 0, explicitly 2\u03c0F12 = pq (p, q \u2208 Z) then the non trivial equations\nare\n!\n\np\nn\u03021 \u2212 \u0175 2 |D25(E, F, W )i = 0\nq\n!\np 1\nn\u03022 + \u0175 |D25(E, F, W )i = 0\nq\n\n(18)\n\nIf we insist on having only integer n then we must conclude that (w 1 , w 2) =\nq(l1 , l2 ) and (n1 , n2 ) = p(l2 , \u2212l1 ) with arbitrary integers l1 and l2 . We can now\ntake the simplest boundary given by the sum of all allowed |n, wi with equal\ncoefficients, i.e. the zero modes non trivial part of the boundary is given by\nP\n|D25(E, F, W )(0)i \u223c (l1 ,l2 )\u2208Z2 |n = p(l2 , \u2212l1 ), w = q(l1 , l2 )i. If we now compute the boundary-boundary interaction as hD25(E, F, W )|e\u2212t(L0+L\u03030 ) |D25(E, F, W )i\nwe see immediately that we get a contribution from these zero modes of the\nt 2 1 2 G2 1 2 T\nP\nform (l1 ,l2 ) e\u2212 2 q (l ,l ) \u03b1\u2032 (l ,l ) (G2 being the G submatrix with indexes running on 1 and 2 only). Performing a Poisson resummation10 on the previous\n2\u03c0 2\n\n\u20321\n\n\u22121 1\n\nT\n\nexpression we find something proportional to (m1 ,m2 )\u2208Z2 e\u2212 t \u03b1 q (m1 ,m2 )G2 q (m1 ,m2 )\nwhich we want to interpret in the open channel. We are therefore led to take\nP\n\n10\n\nThe Poisson formula is as follows\nX\nX\nT\nT \u22121\n1 T\n1\n1\ne\u2212 2 n An+in B = \u221a\ne\u2212 2 (2\u03c0m+B) A (2\u03c0m+B)\ndet\nA\nn\u2208Zd\nm\u2208Zd\n\n9\n\n\fthe open string momenta of the form G2\u22121 1q (m1 , m2 )T . From the F quantization condition (14) we know that q = W 1 W 2 and therefore we find a wrong\nn1\nn1\nopen spectrum which should be of the form G2\u22121 ( W\n1 , W 2 ) as in eq. (13).\nWe notice that the problem becomes even worst when we consider the case\nwhere more 2\u03c0Fij \u221d W i1W j are turned on, since in this case in the generic\nQ\nsituation q \u221d W i (where the product is over all directions where there is\nanon vanishing F ) in order to have integer ns.\n2\n1\nLet us now assume that the (n1 , n2 ) = ( Wl 1 , \u2212 Wl 2 ) then the possible winding are now (w 1 , w 2 ) = (W 1 l1 , W 2 l2 ) again with arbitrary integers l1 and\nl2 . Performing the same steps as before we find that the closed contribut\nP\n1 1\n2 2 T\n1 1\n2 2 G2\ntion is now (l1 ,l2 ) e\u2212 2 (W l ,W l ) \u03b1\u2032 (W l ,W l ) which gives the right expression when Poisson resummed, i.e. a contribution which is proportional to\n2\nP\n\u2212 2\u03c0t \u03b1\u2032 (m1 ,m2 )W \u22121 G2\u22121 W \u22121 (m1 ,m2 )T\ne\n2\n(m1 ,m2 )\u2208Z\nThis is not completely unexpected. In the \"trivial\" case where F = 0 and\nbranes still have a non trivial homology the zero modes contribution to open\nP\n\u2032\n\u22121 \u22121\n\u22121\nT\nstring partition function is (m1 ,m2 )\u2208Z2 e\u2212\u03c4 \u03b1 (m1 ,m2 )W G2 W (m1 ,m2 ) which\ncan be reproduced in the closed string channel if we take a boundary state\nP\nP\n|D25(E, F, W )(0)i \u223c (l1 ,l2 )\u2208Z2 |n = 0, w = (W 1 l1 , W 2 l2 )i = (l1 ,l2 )\u2208Z2 |n =\n0, w = W (l1 , l2 )i, i.e. summing over some (not all!) of the possible closed\nstring states which satisfy (17) for F = 0. But now consider the case of\nboundary states which describe open string interactions on parallel branes\nwithout background fields [3]11 then we know that these boundaries are produced by acting on the usual boundaries by the open string vertex operators\nwhere the open string fields are substituted by the left moving closed string\nfields. In presence of a brane winding W 1 , W 2 times in x1 , x2 directions we\nexpect that\nthe exponential part of the open string vertexes being of the form\nm\nm\ni( 11 , 12 )(X 1 ,X 2 )T\nV \u223ce W W\nand this explains why we can find non integer n12 . We\ncan reformulate this by saying that these non integer momenta are due to\nthe fact that open string sees directions of length 2\u03c0W i while closed string\nsees a length of 2\u03c0 and therefore we need adding more (non physical) states\n11\nThe results in [3] are actually obtained in the case of trivial homology but can easily\nextended to more complex cases where the open string momenta are rational since all\nresults are obtained when arbitrary Wilson lines turned on.\n12\nThere is actually a further subtlety since we have asserted that the open string vertexes\nare made using the left moving part of closed fields only. As shown in [3] there is actually\na further contribution to these interacting boundaries whose aim is to divide equally the\nopen string momenta in the left and right moving sector and this fixes completely all the\ndetails.\n\n10\n\n\fto closed string in order to describe open string states which explore shorter\ndistances.\nBecause of this interpretation of these extra states it must be stressed\nthat they do not represent new physical closed string excitations, i.e. they\ndo not belong to the physical closed string Hilbert space but they are the\nclosed string representations of open string physical states. Nevertheless they\ndo propagate in space time even if the do not interact with closed string while\naway from the brane.\nWith this understanding we can now write the complete boundary state\nas\nTd (E, F )\n|D25(E, F )itime |D25(E, F, W, y)ispace |Dighost\n2\nP\u221e \u20200\n\u20200\n= e\u2212 n=1 an G00 \u00e3n |k 0 = 0 >\n\n|D25(E, F, W, y)i =\n|D25(E, F )itime\n\n|D25(E, F, W, y)ispace = e\u2212\n\nP\u221e\n\nn=1\n\na\u2020n GE \u2212T E \u00e3\u2020T\nn\n\n= e\n\ncw (y)|n = 2\u03c0F w, w >\n\nw\u2208I(F,W )\n\nP\u221e\n\n|Dighost\n\nX\n\nc b\u0303 +c\u0303\u2212n b\u2212n\nn=1 \u2212n \u2212n\n\nc0 + c\u03030\n|q = q\u0303 = 1i\n2\n\nwhere I(F, W ) is the lattice given by I(F, W ) = {w \u2208 Zd |\u2200i & w i \u221d\nW i & n = 2\u03c0F w} 13 , cw (y) are in principle arbitrary complex numbers\nbut because of the open string channel interpretation they turn out to be\nT\ncw (y) = e2\u03c0iw y with yi = e(0) a(0)i , the tension Td (E, F ) can be obtained as\nin [16, 17] and in [2] We have also introduced the usual ghost sector with\nenergy momentum tensor using the conventions of [17] as\nT\n\n(bc)\n\n= \u22122b\u2202c \u2212 \u2202bc =\n\nLbc\n=\n0\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nn=0\n\n\u0010\n\nX\n\nn b\u2020n cn \u2212 c\u2020n bn\n\nLn(bc)\nz n+2\n\n\u0011\n\nsimilarly for the right moving sector and defined the |q = 1q\u0303 = 1i vacuum\nfrom the SL(2, C) invariant ghost vacuum as |q = q\u0303 = 1i = c1 c\u03031 |q = q\u0303 = 0i\nsuch as cn |q = q\u0303 = 1i = c\u0303n |q = q\u0303 = 1i = 0 for n \u2265 1.\n13\n\nSince 2\u03c0Fij =\n\nni =\n\nj\n\nfij s\nWi\n\n\u221d\n\n1\nWi .\n\nfij\nW iW j\n\nwith fij \u2208 Z and wi = W i si with si \u2208 Z this means that\n\n11\n\n(19)\n\n\f3.2\n\nModular transformation\n\nWe can now compute the boundary-boundary interaction as usual as\n(X+bc)\n\nhD25(E, F1, W1 , y1 )|e\u2212t(L0\n\u0012\n\nTd\n2\n\n\u00132\n\n2t\n\nVtime e\n\n\u221e\nY\n\n\u22122nt\n\n(1 \u2212 e\n\nn=1\n\nX\n\n(X+bc)\n\n+L\u03030\n\n)\n\n!2\u22121\n\n\u221e\nY\n\n)\n\n(b0 + b\u03030 )(c0 \u2212 c\u03030 )|D25(E, F2, W2 , y2 )i =\n\nn=1\n\ndet(1 \u2212\nt\n\nc\u2217w (y1 )cw (y2 )\u03b4(F1 \u2212F2 )w,0 e\u2212 2 w\n\nE1\u22121 E1T E2\u2212T E2 e\u22122nt )\n\n!\u22121\n\nT G w\n\u03b1\u2032\n\nw\u2208I(F1 ,W1 )\u2229I(F2 ,W2 )\n\nwhere we have inserted (b0 +b\u03030 )(c0 \u2212c\u03030 ) to account for the surviving part of the\nSL(2, C) symmetry.

It is important\nalso to realizes that given the defining equations for a boundary state (24)\nthere can be many different solutions according to the interpretation we\ngive to the defining equations, besides the difference between integer and\nrational w we stated above there is a further ambiguity associated with a\ngiven 2\u03c0F12 = pq since there can be many different ways of factorizing p = f1 f2\nand q = W 1 W 2 and each of this corresponds to a different configuration.\nThe first solution given by eq.s (25) is the one already discussed in section\n3.1 and describes two branes wrapped W 1 (W 2 ) times along X 1 (X 2 ) .\nThe second solution eq.s (26) can be seen as the T-dual solution of the\nprevious where T-duality has been performed both along X 1 and X 2 and\nit has fractional windings and integer momenta. Given this viewpoint we\ncan think that the branes worldvolumes are orthogonal to the plane X 1 X 2 .\nSince the branes are at fixed position in the coordinate X 1 and X 2 it is not\nunreasonable to interpret this solution as due to the fact that the open string\nsees a fractional periodicity in these directions. From the values of momenta\nin eq. (26) we see that the boundary is invariant for translations which are\nmultiple of 2\u03c0\nin direction X 1 and similarly for X 2 .

(27) holds.\nThe open string sees a fractional periodicity in directions perpendicular to the branes but the closed string sees an integer periodicity therefore\nthe picture from the closed string point of view is the existence of W 1 W 2\nidentical copies of the basic system of two branes covering regularly the\ntorus. Pictorially and naively the basic system of two branes can be portrayed\u0010by taking two Dp\u0011branes spaced along each direction X a a = 1, 2\nby 2\u03c0 e(0) a(0)a \u2212 e(\u03c0) a(\u03c0)a , inscribing them into a parallelogram with side\nlengths W2\u03c0a and then tiling the T 2 torus with side lengths 2\u03c0 using this configuration18 . All systems in this configuration are identical because they are the\nsame system from the open string point of view. This picture is the T-dual\nof the open string point of view of the existence of closed strings which seem\nto be open when seen from the multiple wound open strings perspective.\nThe existence of W 1 W 2 copies is also consistent with the computation of\nthe local energy density in this picture and its T-dual.\nIn the general case the description is more complicated and involves a\ntwisting of the torus on which the open string lives. To find the open\nstring description of the boundary, actually the open string description of\nthe boundary - boundary amplitude, we can proceed as before and again use\nthe fact that the open string zero modes contribution to the one loop free\nenergy must be reproduced by the closed string zero modes contribution to\nthe boundary - boundary amplitude to fix the open string periodicity. We\n\nP\n\nSince either W1f1W2 or\na multiple of T 2 .\n18\n\nW1 W2\nf2\n\nor both can be greater then unity, we are actually tiling\n\n16\n\n\fassume that the open string \"homology\"19 is given by\nX(open) = X(open) + 2\u03c0W s \u2200s \u2208 Z d\n\n(28)\n\nand we want to determine W .

(21), lt \u2208 Zd and we write 2\u03c0F t = W t \u2212T ct W t \u22121\nwith ct \u2208 Matd (Z)20 for the D25 field strength, we can then compare the\nopen string zero modes contribution to the one loop free energy which is\nP\n\u2032\nT\nT\n\u22121 \u22121\n\u2212T\nT\nproportional to n\u2208Zd e\u2212\u03c4 \u03b1 (n+W \u2206(ea)) W G W (n+W \u2206(ea)) to the closed\nstring contribution using the Poisson resummed open string contribution\nP\nT\nT G\nT\nT\nproportional to l\u2208Zd e\u2212l W \u03b1\u2032 W l ei2\u03c0l W \u2206(ea) .\nFrom this we can read the Dp homology matrix which enters the definition\nof |Dpi boundary state (22) as\nW =\n=\n\nPk W t Pk\n0\n\u2032\n\u2212T\nt \u22121 t\n\u2032\n\u2212T\n\u03b1 P\u22a5 \u03b3 W c Pk \u03b1 P\u22a5 \u03b3 W t \u22121 ct P\u22a5\nW t m \u03b4nm\n0\n\u2032 \u2212T ac 1\n\u03b1 (\u03b3 ) W t c ctcn \u03b1\u2032 (\u03b3 \u2212T )ac W1t c ctcb\n\n!\n\n!\n\n(29)\n\nso that the windings entering the boundary are w = W lt with lt \u2208 Z d and\nthe y is connected to y t by\ny = \u03b1\u2032 \u03b3 \u2212T y t\n\n(30)\n\nWe can then conclude that the open string sees a d-dimensional torus\ndefined by eq. (28) and eq. (29) which is different from the closed string\ntorus defined by eq. (1). Using eq. (28) we can read that the two Dps wind\nW m = W t m times in the direction X m parallel to the worldvolume exactly as\nthe original D25 while they see twisted and shrunk perpendicular directions.\nThe shrinking is W1t a for any transverse direction X a and therefore we get\nQ\ntb\nidentical images on the closed string torus.\nbW\n19\n\nActually W contains homological information only in the directions parallel to the\nworldvolume.\n20\nThe ctij = \u2212ctji is the first Chern class along the 2-cycle parametrized by xt i and xt j .\n\n17\n\n\f4.2\n\nThe degenerate case: F t ab = 0.\n\nAs done in the previous section we begin with the simplest case, the T-dual\nversion of eq.s (18) along X 1 :\n!\n\np\nn\u03021 \u2212 n\u03022 |Bi = 0\nq\n!\np\n\u0175 2 + \u0175 1 |Bi = 0\nq\n\n(31)\n\nwhich can be derived from the boundary defining equations P1 \u2212 pq P2 |Bi =\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\u2032\n\nX 2 + pq X 1 |Bi = 0 which cannot be reduced to the standard form of eq.\n(16). These equations suggest to consider the following canonical transformation\nX\u0304 = \u039bX\n!\nr s\n\u039b=\np q\n\n,\n\nP\u0304 = \u039b\u2212T P\n!\nq \u2212p\n\u2212T\n\u039b =\n\u2208 SL(2, Z)\n\u2212s r\n\nWe require \u039b \u2208 SL(2, Z) since we do not want to change the closed string\ntheory and in particular its periodicity which is still X\u0304 \u2261 X\u0304 + 2\u03c0s with\ns \u2208 Z 2 . After this change of coordinate the boundary equations become\ntrivially\n\u2032\n\nP\u03041 |Bi = X\u0304 2 |Bi = 0\nIf we express the zero mode part of the boundary using the T-dual parameterization of the one given in eq. (25), i.e. n\u03041 = n1 , w\u0304 1 = w 1 , n\u03042 = w 2 , w\u0304 2 = n2\nwe find that the part of our interest can be written as\n|Bispace zero modes \u223c\n\nX\nlt\n\n|n\u03041 = 0, n\u03042 = \u2212\n\n1 t1 2\n1 t2 1\nl\n,\nw\u0304\n=\nl , w\u0304 = 0i\nWt1\nWt2\n\nfrom which we can deduce that\nX\u0304(open) \u2261 X\u0304(open) + 2\u03c0 W\u0304 s\n\nW\u0304 =\n\n1\nWt2\n\n0\n\n0\nWt1\n\n!\n\n\u2200s \u2208 Z 2\n\nfrom which results clearly that the open string winds W\u0304 2 = W t1 \u2208 Z times\nin the direction X\u0304 2 parallel to the world volume.\n18\n\n\fThe general case is not treated since it is more difficult to treat since it is\nharder to deal with SL(d, Z) matrices which are needed to move the system\nin the proper coordinates.\nFinally we notice that we can find the same results using the following reasoning (more details will be given elsewhere [4]). From the previous\nexperience with the emission vertexes for closed string states in open string\nformalism [18, 19, 3] we expect that the closed string tachyon emission vertex\nT\nT\ncan be written as WTc (o) \u223c: eikL XL (z) : : eikR XR (z\u0304)) : where XL (z) and XR (z\u0304)\nare the left and right moving part of the open string coordinate. Since we\nknow how kL and kR transform under a T-duality as they are the closed\nstring momenta and if we want a T-duality invariant formalism, we deduce\nimmediately that the left and right moving part of the open string coordinates must transform as the closed string ones, i.e. as it follows from the\nextension of eq.s (5) to an expression involving zero modes too21:\nt\nXL(open) = (P\u22a5 \u03b3 \u2212T E t T + Pk )XL(open)\n\nt\nXR(open) = \u2212(P\u22a5 \u03b3 \u2212T E t \u2212 Pk )XR(open)\n(32)\n\nwhich satisfy the boundary conditions we can read from the boundary state\ndefining eq.s (20). In particular we get the same b.c. as in eq.

These equations reduce to (14) in the simpler case\nF t am = 0.\n21\n\nThese transformation rules were almost obtained in [20] in open string formalism\nguessing the open string canonical transformations (but missing the somewhat important\nB dependence ) and in [21] using path integral formalism in the special case of trivial\nhomology and Fab = 0 where an isometry is present.\n\n19\n\n\f5\n\nConclusions.\n\nIn this article we have shown it is possible to describe branes with non trivial homology and non trivial but constant open background in a non trivial\nbut constant closed background on tori. An interesting and somewhat unexpected consequence is that the physical Hilbert space of closed string theory\nis not enough and therefore it must be extended with some \"twisted\" non\nphysical sectors in order to give a closed string representation of open string\nstates. This extension is dictated by the knowledge of the open string spectrum and cannot be guessed, at least in an obvious way, just from the closed\nstring spectrum. This fact can have non trivial consequences in the construction of branes in curved background using Ishibashi formalism. Infact also\nthe boundary state in flat space can be understood as a weighted sum of\nIshibashi states, therefore it can be necessary to construct Ishibashi states\nusing non physical (for the closed string) representations.\nAnother point we discussed is the fact that open string T-duality does\nnot just amount to an exchange \u03c4 \u2194 \u03c3 in presence of a non trivial B field\nbut requires the open string fields to transform as the closed string ones.\nBecause of this B and F behave differently under T-duality. This fact can\nalso simply explained by noticing that B transformation is ruled by closed\nstring which does not know anything about the open field F . As a further\nconsequence it turns out that if we derive Dp branes by T-duality their\ngeometrical embedding properties are only determined by F . In particular\nthis is also true for type I string where only discrete values of B are allowed\n[22] since B is not in the spectrum because T duality rules are inherited from\ntype IIB.\nAcknowledgments\nThe author thanks M.
