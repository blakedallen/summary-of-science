Our initial reports on the three comets observed in 2001 focused on three HopfieldBirge band systems of CO not previously observed in comets, the B 1 \u03a3+ \u2013 X 1 \u03a3+ (0,0) band\nat 1150.5 \u00c5, the C 1 \u03a3+ \u2013 X 1 \u03a3+ (0,0) band at 1087.9 \u00c5, and the weak E 1 \u03a0 \u2013 X 1 \u03a3+ (0,0)\nband at 1076.1 \u00c5, three lines of H2 fluorescently pumped by solar Lyman-\u03b2 radiation, and\nupper limits to emission from O VI and Ar I. The rotational envelopes of the CO bands\nare resolved and appear to consist of both cold and warm components, the cold component,\nwith a rotational temperature in the range 55\u201375 K, accounting for over 75% of the flux\nand presumably due to native CO released by the nucleus. The warm (\u223c500 K) component\nsuggested a CO2 photodissociation source but this was considered unlikely because the low\nrate for this process in the solar radiation field would have required a very high relative\nabundance of CO2 .\nO VI emission at 1031.9 and 1037.6 \u00c5 was searched for but only the 1031.9 \u00c5 line\nwas marginally detected in C/2000 WM1 at about the level predicted by a model used to\nexplain the X-ray emission from comets as being produced by charge exchange between solar\nwind ions and cometary neutrals (Kharchenko & Dalgarno 2001). The higher signal/noise\nratio in the spectrum of comet C/2001 Q4, observed in April 2004, enabled an accurate\ndetermination of the wavelength of this feature which suggested that it was the H2 (1,1) Q(3)\nWerner (C 1 \u03a0u \u2212X 1 \u03a3+\ng ) line, which can be fluorescently pumped by either solar N III \u03bb989.8\nor O VI \u03bb1031.9. The latter requires the H2 to be in the first vibrationally excited state\n(Liu & Dalgarno 1996). The Q(3) lines of the (1,3) band at 1119.1 \u00c5 and the (1,4) band\nat 1163.8 \u00c5 are also detected as would be expected for fluorescent excitation. However,\nthe ground state H2 abundance in the coma, estimated from the solar Lyman-\u03b2 pumped\n1 +\nfluorescence of the Lyman (B 1 \u03a3+\nu \u2212 X \u03a3g ) (6,1) P1 line, is insufficient for excitation by\nsolar N III (a factor of 10 weaker than O VI), which implies the formation of H2 in the v = 1\nstate and excitation by solar O VI.\nThe molecular channel of the photodissociation of formaldehyde (i.e., the channel leading to H2 and CO products) has been well studied both experimentally and theoretically. Its\nproducts are characterized by a non-thermal rotationally \"hot\" CO molecule and a vibrationally excited H2 molecule (van Zee et al. 1993). The CO rotational distribution can be\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nrepresented by a gaussian centered near J = 40 with a half-width at half maximum in J of\nabout 20. Fluorescence from such levels in the P-branch (the R-branch is shortward of the\ndetector wavelength cut-off) is clearly seen in two of the comets observed by FUSE and we\npropose that this feature, together with the vibrationally excited H2 , constitute an unambiguous signature of H2 CO in a cometary coma. Formaldehyde has been observed in these\ncomets in both the infrared and millimeter spectral regions (Biver et al. 2006; Milam et al.\n2006; Gibb et al. 2007). The capability of FUSE to identify H2 CO in a cometary coma provides a new means to determine its production rate relative to that of water and to compare\nthese results with ground-based observations in the infrared and millimeter regions of the\nspectrum.\nSince the thermal \"hot\" component of the observed CO emission is not produced by\nH2 CO dissociation, we return to CO2 as a possible parent, particularly as the rotational\ntemperature is what would be expected based solely on angular momentum conservation\narguments (Mumma et al. 1975). We suggest that within the FUSE field-of-view, photoelectron impact dissociation of CO2 has a comparable rate to photodissociation and we base\nthis conclusion on estimates of the mean photoelectron flux derived from the other prominent\nCO band observed in these spectra, the B \u2212 X (0,0) band at 1151 \u00c5. We thus have unique\ndiagnostics in which the shapes of these molecular bands can be used to infer the column\nabundance of CO from both its native source as well as from two of its direct molecular\nparents, together with the photoelectron contributions to excitation and dissociation in the\ninner coma.\n\n2.\n\nOBSERVATIONS\n\nThree long period comets were observed during 2001, C/1999 T1 (McNaught-Hartley),\nC/2001 A2 (LINEAR), and C/2000 WM1 (LINEAR), with C/2001 A2 being the most active\nof the three and showing the brightest far-ultraviolet emissions. In December 2001, two of\nthe reaction wheels on the spacecraft failed resulting in a shutdown of observatory operations\nuntil a new pointing control program could be devised and implemented a few months later.\nHowever, no moving target observations were attempted until early in 2004 when comet\nC/2001 Q4 (NEAT) was observed. The observation parameters for all four comets are\nsummarized in Table 1.\nObservations of each comet were made over contiguous spacecraft orbits during which\nthe center of the 30\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 30\u2032\u2032 spectrograph aperture was placed at the ephemeris position of\nthe comet and tracked at the predicted sky rate. Due to the extended, though not uniform,\nnature of the cometary emissions within the aperture, the effective spectral resolution is\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\n\u223c0.25 \u00c5. For each comet, all of the orbits of data were co-added and the extracted fluxes\nwere converted to average brightness (in rayleighs) in the 30\u2032\u2032 \u00d730\u2032\u2032 aperture. In addition, the\ndata were separately co-added for only the time during which the spacecraft was in Earth\nshadow. These \"night-only\" spectra make it possible to differentiate cometary emissions of\nH I, O I, N I, and, in second order, He I, from the same emissions produced in the daytime\nterrestrial atmosphere (Feldman et al. 2001). For the CO and H2 emissions this is not a\nproblem and the entire data set for each comet was used.\nAll of the data were reprocessed using the final version of the FUSE pipeline, CalFUSE 3.2 (Dixon et al. 2007). Among the enhancements incorporated in this version were\ntemperature-dependent wavelength corrections, time-dependent corrections to the detector\neffective areas, and a more complete evaluation of detector background. The latter was particularly significant in allowing reliable extractions of the fluxes of weak emission features.\nThe overall absolute flux calibration, based on standard stars and adjusted for the date\nof observation, is better than 5%. Table 1 also lists the extracted brightnesses of the CO\nemission features discussed below.\n\n3.\n\nSPECTRA\n3.1.\n\nData\n\nThe CO C \u2212 X (0,0) band, from the total exposure, is shown for each comet in Figure 1.\nThe P and R branches appear well separated, characteristic of a rotational temperature of\n55\u201375 K. There also appear broad wings to the band indicative of a rotational temperature\nin the range of 500 to 600 K. The figures also show a model fit, assuming solar resonance\nfluorescence, obtained using the procedure described by Feldman et al. (2002). The derived\ncolumn densities and rotational temperatures are given in Table 2. In the two most active\ncomets, C/2001 A2 and C/2001 Q4, there is also an additional broad feature centered at\n\u223c1089.4 \u00c5, that we identify as P-branch lines from high-lying J states. The position of the\nP(40) line, calculated using the rotational constants of Eidelsberg et al. (1991), is also shown\nin Fig. 1. We note that the Eidelsberg et al. wavelengths have been verified experimentally\nonly up to J = 25. The corresponding high J R-lines are off the short wavelength edge of the\nLiF2a detector. A \"hot\" thermal rotational distribution arises in molecular photodissociation\nin order to conserve angular momentum when the product molecule has a much smaller\nmoment-of-inertia than the parent molecule as is the case for CO2 (Mumma et al. 1975).\nThe non-thermal component is identified with CO as a dissociation product of H2 CO, and\nthe column abundance of this component, also given in Table 2, is derived assuming an\nequal contribution from the unobserved R-branch. In this case, an optically thin band\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nfluorescence efficiency is used as the CO population is spread over many rotational levels\nand the absorption is not likely to be optically thick.\n\n3.2.\n\nPhotodissociation of Formaldehyde\n\nAs noted above, the photodissociation of formaldehyde has been intensively studied,\nboth experimentally and theoretically. The lowest dissociation threshold (\u223c3600 \u00c5) leads to\nH2 + CO (the \"molecular\" channel) while \u223c2700 cm\u22121 higher (\u223c3300 \u00c5), H + HCO (the\n\"radical\" channel) can also be produced (van Zee et al. 1993). The nature of the H2 and CO\nproducts differs markedly above and below this second energy threshold. Consider first the\nregion below the radical channel threshold. Bamford et al. (1985) and Debarre et al. (1985)\nhave used laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy and coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering\nto experimentally study the product state populations of CO and H2 . Bamford et al. found a\nnonthermal highly excited CO rotational population with a Gaussian distribution centered at\nJ = 40 and a half-width at half maximum of 20 J units, but with little vibrational excitation.\nLater work (e.g., van Zee et al. 1993) showed that the shape was dependent on the energy\nof the absorbed photon. It should be noted that the absorption of H2 CO in this region is in\ndiscrete bands (Rogers 1990). For H2 , Debarre et al. found that the primary products are\nthe ortho (J = 3 and 5) states of v = 1. For photolysis at 3390 \u00c5 they found the fractional\npopulation of the v = 1, J = 3 level to be 11%. Butenhoff et al. (1990) extended this work\nto additional wavelengths and found a peak H2 population in v = 1, J = 3.\nAbove the radical channel threshold, H2 and CO are found to have markedly different\npopulations with the non-translational energy going principally to vibrational excitation of\nH2 while the CO rotational state population shifts to lower J states (van Zee et al. 1993).\nZhang et al. (2005) demonstrated that the population of vibrationally excited H2 , up to\nv = 8 or 9, increased as the energy of the exciting photon increased with a corresponding\nincrease in the low-J state population of CO such that the non-translational energy was\nconserved. However, the peak at J = 40 remained and the low-J population was still highly\nnon-thermal. Chambreau et al. (2006) showed that the excited vibrational levels of H2 also\nhad peak rotational populations at J = 5 or 7, depending on the photolysis energy.\nIn the solar radiation field in the coma of a comet, the H2 and CO state populations\nderived from H2 CO dissociation will reflect a superposition of populations, weighted by the\nsolar flux and absorption cross section (Huebner et al. 1992). Such a calculation is beyond\nthe scope of the present paper. The broad, weak feature seen longward of the C \u2212 X\n(0,0) band in comets C/2001 A2 and C/2001 Q4 in Fig. 1 is centered near the position\nof the P(40) line of this band, and the non-thermal high-J population of this feature is\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nan unambiguous fingerprint of CO produced from H2 CO photodissociation. Although the\nspectrum of C/2000 WM1 is significantly noisier, the data also suggest enhanced emission on\nthe red wing of the band in this comet. Further evidence for this source is the simultaneous\ndetection of fluorescence from vibrationally excited H2 in this comet (Liu et al. 2007) as well\nas in comets C/2001 A2 and C/2001 Q4.\n\n3.3.\n\nFluorescence of Vibrationally Excited H2\n\nIn Figure 2 the region of the O VI doublet in comet C/2001 Q4 is shown, and the\nH2 (1,1) Q(3) line is identified, separated by 0.06 \u00c5 from the position of the O VI line\nat 1031.92 \u00c5. The uncertainty in the FUSE wavelength scale is \u223c0.01 \u00c5. The same figure\nalso shows the corresponding (1,3) Q(3) and (1,4) Q(3) lines at 1119.09 and 1163.79 \u00c5,\nrespectively (Liu & Dalgarno 1996). Note that there is no emission at the expected position\nof the O VI line at 1037.62 \u00c5. These lines are quite weak and with the exception of a 3-\u03c3\ndetection in comet C/2000 WM1 (Liu et al. 2007) do not appear in the spectra of the two\nother comets observed by FUSE .\nThe absence of these lines in the other two comets is the result of the heliocentric\nDoppler shift of the exciting solar line, the Swings effect (Feldman et al. 2004), rather than\nthe lack of H2 in the coma. This can be illustrated with the solar O VI \u03bb1031.9 line profile.\nDoschek & Feldman (2004) have used the recent solar spectra taken by the SUMER instrument on SOHO with an instrumental resolution of \u223c0.1 \u00c5, to determine the width of this\nline under quiet sun conditions to be 0.202 \u00c5. This result is from an observation of a small\npart of the solar disk near the center, while for the calculation of cometary excitation rates\nthe whole disk flux is more useful. Fortuitously, we are able to take advantage of a minor\noperational problem of FUSE (Sahnow et al. 2000), a sensitivity at certain orientations on\nthe sky of the silicon carbide (SiC) channels to scattered solar radiation, to determine the\nwhole disk line shape. The observation of comet C/2001 Q4 resulted in such an orientation and the SiC1b and SiC1a channels (905\u2013992 and 1005\u20131090 \u00c5, respectively) measured\na large scattered solar flux in all three apertures. Both the high (HIRS, 1.\u2032\u2032 5 \u00d7 20\u2032\u2032 ) and\nmedium resolution (MDRS, 4\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 20\u2032\u2032 ) apertures obtained good S/N spectra of the O VI lines\nat instrumental resolutions of 0.035 and 0.075 \u00c5, respectively. From both of these channels\nwe derived a width of 0.200 \u00c5 for the solar O VI \u03bb1031.9 line, in excellent agreement with\nthe result of Doschek & Feldman. The MDRS profile is shown in Figure 3, together with\nthe Doppler shifted positions of the H2 (1,1) Q(3) line for each comet. Note that the profile\nshown in the figure suggests that the solar line is not adequately represented by a single\nGaussian. Clearly, the detection of the (1,v \u2032\u2032 ) lines in comet C/2001 Q4 was favored by its\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nnegative heliocentric velocity and by the relatively high activity level of this comet at the\ntime of observation.\nWolven et al. (1997) noted that solar Lyman-\u03b1 (1216.57 \u00c5) could pump vibrationally\nexcited H2 in the v = 2 level via the Lyman band (1,2) P(5) and R(6) lines, and used this\nmechanism to identify fluorescence from the upper level in Hubble Space Telescope spectra of\nJupiter following the impact of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 in July 1994. The same mechanism\nhas recently been found to operate in planetary nebulae where the FUSE spectra show the\n(1,1) P(5) and R(6) lines at 1161.82 and 1161.95 \u00c5, respectively (Lupu et al. 2006). One\nof the previously unidentified lines reported in FUSE spectra of comets at 1161.83 \u00c5 was\nidentified by Liu et al. (2007) as a blend of these two H2 lines (see Fig. 2). The vibrationally\nexcited H2 would most likely come from H2 CO rather than H2 O photodissocation as proposed by Liu et al. This feature has roughly the same brightness in comets C/2001 A2 and\nC/2001 Q4, and we note that the brightnesses of the CO P(40) feature in these two comets\nare also comparable. From the branching ratios given by Lupu et al., we would also expect\nto see the (1,1) R(3) line at 1148.70 \u00c5 and the (1,1) P(8) line at 1183.31 \u00c5 from the same\nexcited J levels, and indeed we do. The latter is considerably weaker than the former due\nto the lower population of the even-J (para) states as expected.\nLiu et al. also identified several other cometary lines as being pumped by solar Lyman-\u03b1\nfrom higher vibrational and rotational levels of H2 . Almost all of the strong unidentified features tabulated by Feldman (2005) are amongst them. Our analysis supports the conclusion\nof Liu et al. that the vast majority of emission features in the FUSE spectra of comets can be\nattributed to H2 . However, unlike Liu et al., who proposed that the excited vibrational and\nrotational levels of H2 arise from the photodissociation of H2 O, we suggest instead that these\nexcited H2 states are produced during the photodissociation of H2 CO because their presence\nin the cometary coma is consistent with the H2 level populations measured during H2 CO\nphotodissociation in the laboratory by Zhang et al. (2005) and Chambreau et al. (2006).\n\n3.4.\n\nElectron Impact Excitation of CO and Dissociation of CO2\n\nThe CO B \u2212 X (0,0) band at 1151 \u00c5 is weaker than the C \u2212 X (0,0) band by a factor of\n3 to 4 and thus recorded with poorer signal/noise in all four comets as shown in Figure 4. It\nis surprising that this band is observed at all since its fluorescence efficiency is 44 times lower\nthan that of the C \u2212X (0,0) band (the predicted spectra using the CO column densities given\nin Table 2 are also shown in the figure). There must be an additional source of excitation,\nand since the band shape is consistent with the low temperature CO component, that can\nonly be electron impact excitation of CO. Photoelectrons in the inner comae of comets have\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nbeen considered by several authors (e.g., Ashihara 1978; K\u00f6r\u00f6smezey et al. 1987), and were\ndetected in the Vega fly-by of 1P/Halley (Gringauz et al. 1986), but their role in excitation,\ndissociation and ionization is difficult to quantify.\nAn equivalent to the fluorescence efficiency, or g-factor, may be defined by an electron\nexcitation rate per molecule per second, g \u2032 :\n\u2032\n\ng =\n\nZ Z\n\nF (E)\u03c3(E)dEd\u03a9\n\nwhere F (E) is the photoelectron flux in electrons s\u22121 cm\u22122 sr\u22121 eV\u22121 and \u03c3(E) is the cross\nsection in cm2 . In general, the photoelectron flux is a function of cometocentric distance and\nis anisotropic so that g \u2032 will vary over the spectrograph field-of-view.\nRather than attempt to use modeled photoelectron fluxes, we instead use the observed\nCO B \u2212 X (0,0) band brightnesses to derive an effective g \u2032 over the FUSE aperture but\nthen use the modeled electron energy distribution to determine the relative excitation rates\nfor other processes. In particular, we are interested in the electron impact dissociation rate\nof CO2 . Relevant cross sections in analytic form for electron impact on CO and CO2 are\navailable from the compilation of Shirai et al. (2001). Figure 5 shows the cross sections for\nelectron impact excitation on CO of the two bands under discussion and that for electron impact dissociation of CO2 into the metastable a 3 \u03a0 state of CO. A typical photoelectron energy\ndependence, from K\u00f6r\u00f6smezey et al. (1987), is also shown. The a 3 \u03a0 state is the upper level\nof the CO Cameron bands, whose excitation in comets has been discussed by Weaver et al.\n(1994). The total CO2 dissociation cross section has been studied by Cosby & Helm (1992).\nThese authors note that the branching ratio into the a 3 \u03a0 state of CO is 27% of the total\nelectron dissociation rate, the same as for solar photodissociation (Huebner et al. 1992).\nThe derived values of g \u2032 , reduced to 1 AU, are given in Table 3. For comparison, the\noptically thin solar fluorescence efficiencies are also given. Figure 5 shows that the steep\nincrease of photoelectron flux towards lower energies favors the B \u2212 X transitions over the\nC \u2212 X. Even so, the electron impact contribution to C state excitation will reduce the\nderived CO column abundances by 5\u201315% and this is reflected in the values given in Table 2.\nThese numbers remain uncertain as both the photoelectron energy distribution and flux will\nvary with increasing column density towards the nucleus. This will also affect the ratio of\ntotal CO2 dissociation to that fraction leading to the a 3 \u03a0 state of CO. The g \u2032 values for these\nprocesses, for the photoelectron model adopted, are also given in Table 3. For comparison\nwith photodissociation at 1 AU, the solar maximum value given by Huebner et al. (1992)\nis 2.56 \u00d7 10\u22126 molecule\u22121 s\u22121 , so electron impact dissociation and photodissociation are\ncomparable.\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nEvidence for a significant role of photoelectrons in the inner coma has often been noted\nin the literature. Two particular cases in which photodissociation and photoionization were\ninadequate to account for the abundance of daughter products are the production of atomic\ncarbon in the metastable 1 D state from CO (Tozzi et al. 1998) and the high concentration of\nCO2+ close to the nucleus seen in early IUE spectra (Festou et al. 1982). The FUSE spectra\nprovide additional evidence in the strong O I 1 D \u2013 1 Do line at 1152.16 \u00c5, seen in Fig. 4,\nwhich also cannot be accounted for by solar resonance scattering alone. The lower state of\nthis transition, the metastable 1 D state, is an abundant product of photodissociation of\nH2 O, OH, and CO, and is the upper level of the oxygen \"red\" lines at 6300 and 6364 \u00c5, seen\nin many comets and often used as a surrogate for the water production rate (Feldman et al.\n2004).\n\n4.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\n4.1.\n\nModeling\n\nThe column density of the non-thermal component of CO was modeled assuming an\nH2 CO parent using the vectorial model of Festou (1981) with solar photodestruction rates\ngiven by Huebner et al. (1992). Meier et al. (1993) have also evaluated the photodissociation\nlifetimes (H2 CO has two other dissociation channels, H + HCO, and H + H + CO) and find\nthe rate into H2 + CO to be 25% lower than that of Huebner et al. while the total rate\nis 7% lower. Bockel\u00e9e-Morvan & Crovisier (1992) find a total photodissociation lifetime in\nclose agreement with that of Huebner et al. The model assumes a nucleus source for the\nH2 CO. Even if a distributed source were present (see Section 4.4 below), the size of the\nFUSE aperture translates to a few thousand km projected on the sky and such a source can\nbe ignored for our purposes.\nTo determine production rates relative to water, we use values of QH2 O taken from the\nrecent literature; values derived from SOHO/SWAN measurements of cometary Lyman-\u03b1\nemission by Combi et al. (2008), and those derived from ODIN submillimeter observations\nof H2 O directly by Biver et al. (2007). Where they overlap, these two sets of values are\nin agreement to \u223c20\u201325%. We adopt the values from Combi et al. because of their finer\nsampling grid, allowing us to use data from the same day as the FUSE observations. We\nuse the deconvolved model results from Combi et al. rather than the daily averages given.\nFor C/2001 Q4 we use a value derived from near-simultaneous HST observations of OH\nemission, which is close to that reported by Biver et al.\nFor C/2001 A2 we note a significant difference from the value of QH2 O cited in the initial\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nreports of the FUSE observations by Feldman et al. (2002) and Weaver et al. (2002). The\nearlier estimate was based on a visual outburst two days prior to the observation and a modeled production rate adjusted to match the derived H2 column density. The latter was based\non fluorescence efficiencies derived by Krasnopolsky & Feldman (2001). With the availability\nof detailed solar Lyman-\u03b2 fluxes and line shapes from SOHO/SUMER (Lemaire et al. 2002),\nthe heliocentric velocity dependent g-factors were recalculated and the H2 column density\nrevised downward by a factor of about three, which is consistent with the water production\nrate for the date given by Combi et al.\nThe results are given in Table 4. For the comets in which the non-thermal CO is\ndetected, the production rates of H2 CO relative to that for H2 O are generally in the range\nof values found from infrared and millimeter observations. Biver et al. (2006) reported on\nfour comets observed at millimeter wavelengths including the three comets observed by\nFUSE at comparable epochs in 2001. For comets C/2001 A2 and C/2000 WM1, our relative\nproduction rates are comparable to those of Biver et al. based on their model that assumes\na distributed source with an effective parent lifetime about a factor of 2 longer than the\ntrue photochemical lifetime. With an assumed H2 CO parent, Biver et al. derive relative\nproduction rates 2 \u2212 4 times smaller.\nMillimeter observations of comet C/2001 Q4 were made in mid-May 2004 by Milam et al.\n(2006). Their results for H2 CO, again assuming a distributed grain source, are in close\nagreement with the FUSE value. While infrared bands of H2 CO near 3.6 \u03bcm have been\ndetected in a number of recent comets, the only data available for comparison with the\nFUSE observations is of C/2001 A2 (Gibb et al. 2007). Gibb et al., observing 2 and 3 days\nprior to the FUSE observation, found a low value of 0.24% for the ratio of the production\nrate of H2 CO relative to H2 O on July 9.5 followed by a decrease of a factor of 4 one day\nlater. In contrast, we derive a much higher value for this ratio on July 12.5. The apparent\nvariability of H2 CO is discussed below in Section 4.2.\nModeling the H2 brightness is not as straightforward. The H2 molecules initially carry\naway most of the excess energy of dissociation as translational energy (\u223c11 km s\u22121 ), but they\nare rapidly thermalized in the inner coma (Combi et al. 2004). The excited state populations\nwill also vary with incident wavelength and be altered by collisions, so the actual number\nof H2 molecules in the v = 1, J = 3 level produced by solar photodissociation will have a\nlarge uncertainty. Nevertheless, as a consistency check we can evaluate the number of such\nmolecules in the field-of-view needed to produce the observed 0.13 rayleigh brightness of the\n(1,1) Q(3) line at 1031.86 \u00c5 observed in comet C/2001 Q4. The fluorescence efficiency, or\ng-factor, at the peak of the solar O VI line is calculated using the solar minimum irradiance\nrecommended by Warren (2005) and the oscillator strengths and branching ratios taken from\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nthe compilation of Abgrall et al. (1993b). The derived g-factor is 3.8 \u00d7 10\u22127 s\u22121 molecule\u22121\nat 1 AU, so that a mean column density of 3.6 \u00d7 1011 cm\u22122 is sufficient to produce the\nobserved emission rate. From Table 2, the column density of non-thermal CO in this comet\nis 4.1 \u00d7 1012 cm\u22122 , and 78% of those are accompanied by H2 rather than by two H atoms\n(Huebner et al. 1992). Thus 11% of the total H2 needs to be in v = 1, J = 3, which is\nplausible based on the laboratory data of Zhang et al. (2005) and Chambreau et al. (2006).\nGiven all of the uncertainties, this is good agreement and supports our proposal that H2 CO is\nthe source of both the non-thermal CO and the vibrationally excited H2 detected by FUSE .\nThe H2 vibrational population may also be examined with the identification of solar\nLyman-\u03b1 pumping of lines in the Lyman (1,2) band as described in Section 3.3. The solar\nLyman-\u03b1 spectral flux is roughly two orders of magnitude larger than that of O VI \u03bb1031.9\nresulting in comparably larger fluorescence efficiencies for these lines. Using solar minimum\nLyman-\u03b1 fluxes from Lemaire et al. (2002) and molecular data for the Lyman bands from\nAbgrall et al. (1993a), the g-factors for the (1,1) P(5) and R(6) lines can be calculated. The\nrelative population of the v = 2, J = 5, needed to account for the observed 1161.8 \u00c5 emission\nof 0.24 rayleighs is 2%. This is consistent with the relative population of this level seen in\nthe laboratory experiments (Zhang et al. 2005), when we consider that these experiments are\ndone at discrete wavelengths while in the cometary context photodissociation is produced\nby the wavelength integrated solar flux.\nWe conclude that photodissociation of H2 CO is sufficient to produce vibrationally excited H2 that accounts for the presence of Lyman-\u03b1 excited fluorescence of H2 in the coma.\nWhile the production rate of H2 CO is \u223c0.5% relative to H2 O, the solar photodissociation rate\ninto H2 is \u223c100 times higher for H2 CO, depending on the solar activity level (Huebner et al.\n1992). Thus both molecules contribute comparable amounts of H2 to the coma. The branching of water photodissociation into H2 + O(1 D) has also been studied in the laboratory\n(Slanger & Black 1982), but there are no available measurements of the resultant H2 level\npopulations. Although there has been extensive theoretical work on the H + OH channel of\nH2 O photodissociation (Schinke 1993), there does not seem any devoted to the H2 + O(1 D)\nchannel, which is clearly warranted. On the basis of the brightness of the Lyman-\u03b2 pumped\nfluorescent lines, Feldman et al. (2002) suggested that solar photodissociation of water led\nto a thermal population of H2 molecules in the v = 0, J = 1 level.\n\n4.2.\n\nCaveat on Temporal Variability\n\nWe noted above the utility of the SOHO/SWAN data of Combi et al. (2008) to obtain\ndaily values of the water production rate. For C/2001 A2 near the time of the FUSE ob-\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nservations, the comet exhibited several visual outbursts, particularly one on 2001 July 11.5,\none day before the FUSE observations, which saw a 1.5 magnitude increase in visual brightness (Sekanina et al. 2002). These outbursts were reflected in sudden increases in QH2 O of\nfactors of 2\u20133 in one day in the data of Combi et al.. The FUSE observations of this comet\nspanned 7.5 hours during which the CO emission decreased by a factor of two (Fig. 6), likely\na manifestation of the decrease in coma abundance following the outburst. Note that for\nthis comet the FUSE 30\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 30\u2032\u2032 aperture projects to 6500 \u00d7 6500 km on the sky so that a\nmolecule moving radially outward at 1 km s\u22121 would exit the field-of-view in less than one\nhour. Hence the observed variation represents variability of the CO source on this time scale.\nOn the other hand, the column densities given in Table 2 are taken from the summed spectra\n(to improve the signal/noise ratio) and thus represent average values. Caution is therefore\nurged in deriving relative production rates from diverse observations, even if obtained on the\nsame date, and in the comparison of results from different observers.\nThe July 11.5 outburst makes it difficult to compare the derived H2 CO production\nrates of Gibb et al. (2007) on July 9.5 and 10.5, noted above, with the present results. From\nthe limited data available, it is not possible to determine whether H2 CO production was\nenhanced by the outburst or whether the increase inferred from the FUSE spectra is just\nthe result of intrinsic variability responsible for the change seen by Gibb et al. a few days\nearlier. The same holds for a comparison of our results with the CO production rate derived\nfrom the same infrared spectrum on July 10.5 (Magee-Sauer et al. 2008) even though in this\ncase the values of QCO are comparable.\nA similar caveat applies to comet C/2001 Q4 which FUSE observed over a 27 h period.\nThe variation of the CO emission is shown in Fig. 7 and can be fit with a sinusoidal curve\nof period 17.0 h and 22% amplitude. Yet the CO production rate, derived from HST /STIS\nobservations of the CO Fourth Positive system (Lupu et al. 2007), made near a minimum\nin the FUSE lightcurve, is consistent with the mean value derived from the FUSE spectra.\nIn contrast, comet C/2001 WM1 showed little variation in CO emission over a 60 h period.\nFor this comet, simultaneous HST /STIS observations were also obtained and Lupu et al.\nderived comparable CO production rates from both sets of spectra.\n\n4.3.\n\nRelative Abundance of CO2\n\nAs noted in Section 3.4, for molecules with long lifetimes against solar photodissociation\nsuch as CO2 , electron impact dissociation becomes an important destruction channel. Using\nthe electron impact rates given in Table 3, however, would still require an abnormally large\n(\u2265 20%) abundance of CO2 to account for the derived \"hot\" CO column density. Since\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nthere are no other suitable parents for CO other than CO2 and H2 CO, it is likely that the\nmodel used to calculate the values given in Table 3 significantly underestimates the electron\nimpact contribution to CO2 dissociation. Cosby & Helm (1992) note that the threshold for\nthis process is at 7.4 eV whereas the channel leading to the a 3 \u03a0 state of CO requires 11.4 eV.\nAt low electron energies, the model of K\u00f6r\u00f6smezey et al. (1987) does not match the data of\nGringauz et al. (1986), which appears to follow an E \u22121 distribution, so that there may be\nan additional large contribution to the dissociation rate from low energy electrons. There\nare also uncertainties in the radial and angular distribution of the electrons that make our\nestimate quantitatively unreliable. A more complete analysis of cometary photoelectrons,\nwhich is beyond the scope of the present paper, would entail an analysis of CO Cameron band\nemission similar to that presented by Weaver et al. (1994). Fortunately, relevant HST /STIS\nspectra do exist for comet C/2001 Q4 and will be treated in a separate publication.\n\n4.4.\n\nDistributed Source of CO\n\nThe first evidence for a distributed source of CO in the coma of a comet came from the\nin situ Neutral Mass Spectrometer experiment on the Giotto mission to comet 1P/Halley\n(Eberhardt et al. 1987; Eberhardt 1999). Meier et al. (1993) also showed, from the same\ndata set, that the H2 CO also appeared to come from an extended source and that the H2 CO\nwas sufficient to account for the extended CO (Eberhardt 1999). Polyoxymethylene (POM),\nevaporated from organic material on refractory grains, has been postulated as the source\nof this H2 CO (Cottin et al. 2004). In recent years, as high resolution spectroscopic instrumentation in the near infrared has made the observation of CO in comets almost routine,\nconsiderable effort has been expended in trying to determine if such distributed sources are\ncommon or unique to certain comets (Bockel\u00e9e-Morvan et al. 2004). Identification of a distributed emission source is based on long-slit spectroscopy in which the spatial profile of the\nemission deviates from that expected for radial outflow (DiSanti et al. 2001; Brooke et al.\n2003). For CO this can be done in both the infrared and the ultraviolet.\nThis approach is applicable only to the brightest comets because the spatial pixels along\nthe slit must be small enough to provide adequate spatial resolution. For such comets, such\nas C/1995 O1 (Hale-Bopp), the CO column densities along the line-of-sight (to both the\nSun and to the observer) are sufficiently large that optical depth effects tend to produce a\nflattening of the spatial profile near the nucleus that mimics the effect of a distributed source\n(the ultraviolet case has been discussed by Lupu et al. 2007). This concern was addressed\nby DiSanti et al. in their analysis of CO in comet Hale-Bopp. They found a very high\nproduction rate of CO relative to that of water, 24.1%, with half being from the nucleus and\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nthe other half from a distributed source. In the same comet, Brooke et al. (2003) found an\neven higher relative abundance of CO, 37\u201341%, with 90% coming from a distributed source.\nBockel\u00e9e-Morvan et al. (2005) questioned both of these results suggesting that they were the\neffect of a large infrared opacity, even though both DiSanti et al. and Brooke et al. accounted\nfor opacity effects. In any case, if such a distributed source were H2 CO it would imply an\nabundance in this comet an order of magnitude higher than that cited by Biver et al. (2006).\n\n5.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nSpectroscopic observations of four comets by FUSE have opened a new window for the\ninvestigation of the physics and chemistry of the cometary coma. The high spectral resolution\nof FUSE has made it possible to separate the multiple components of the CO emission, while\nthe high sensitivity has allowed the detection of fluorescent H2 emission pumped by solar\nO VI radiation. Both of these can be understood in terms of the dissociation processes of\nH2 CO and CO2 . Despite the small sample, it is clear that previous ultraviolet spectroscopic\nobservations of CO in comets including those from sounding rockets, IUE and HST (e.g.,\nFeldman et al. 1997) probably included these additional components of CO that were not\nresolved, either spectrally or spatially, from the native (\"cold\") CO with the instrumentation\nused. Photoelectron excitation contributes \u223c10% of the observed emission of the CO C \u2212 X\n(0,0) band and needs to be accounted for in deriving CO production rates from FUSE\nobservations.\nWe thank the FUSE ground system personnel, particularly B. Roberts, T. Ake, A.\nBerman, B. Gawne, and J. Andersen, for their efforts in planning and executing these moving\ntarget observations.
