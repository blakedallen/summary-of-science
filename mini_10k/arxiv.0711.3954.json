Introduction\nThe binary \u03b2 Lyr is a nearly edge-on, semi-detached interacting system that has undergone mass reversal and remains in a\nphase of large-scale mass transfer. The primary, mass-losing star\n(the \"Loser\") is a B6-B8 IIp star. The mass-gaining star (the\n\"Gainer\") is embedded in an optically thick accretion disk and\nis not directly visible. Although the embedded source had been\nconsidered as a possible compact object (Devinney 1971; Wilson\n1971), it is probably a main sequence B0 star (Hubeny & Plavec\n1991). The system is very complex, having bipolar jet-like structures (Harmanec et al. 1996; Hoffman et al. 1998), a circumbinary envelope (Batten & Sahade 1973; Hack et al. 1975), and a\nsubstantial kilo-Gauss magnetic field (Leone et al. 2003).\nThe optical light curve of the system features a primary minimum that is \u2248 1 magnitude deep and a secondary minimum\n\u2248 0.4 magnitudes deep (see Fig. 1); however, the secondary\nminimum is deeper than the primary minimum at shorter wavelengths, and below Ly\u03b1 the eclipses no longer appear (Kondo\net al. 1994). A summary of the system properties is given in\nTable 1. The orbital period is 12.9 days, and the mean light\ncurves appear stable with epoch. The UV spectrum of \u03b2 Lyr is\ndominated by an anomalous continuum and emission lines with\nunusually strong P Cygni profiles typical of hot star winds (Hack\net al. 1975; Aydin et al. 1988; Mazzali 1987).\nSend offprint requests to: R. Ignace, e-mail: ignace@etsu.edu\n\u22c6\nNSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellow\n\u22c6\u22c6\nCurrently at Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of\nDenver\n\nDespite numerous and ongoing modeling attempts (e.g.,\nWilson 1974; Linnell & Hubeny 1996; Bisikalo et al. 2000;\nLinnell 2002; Nazarenko & Glazunova 2003, 2006ab), no model\nis yet capable of matching the observed light curves of \u03b2 Lyr\nfrom the IR through the UV. Strangely, \u03b2 Lyr has been largely\nunstudied in the X-ray regime, despite the strong X-ray flux detected by the ROSAT HRI (Bergh\u00f6fer & Schmitt 1994). An unpublished spectrum taken with the EINSTEIN/SSS in 1979 reveals X-ray emission at relatively high energies, suggesting that\nphase-dependent observations may provide new clues to resolving the puzzle of the \u03b2 Lyr geometry and interactions. Exploiting\nSuzaku's excellent sensitivity to hard X-rays, we conducted three\npointed observations of \u03b2 Lyr within the same orbit. In the following section the observations and reduction of data are detailed. Analyses of the spectra with phase are described in \u00a73,\nand a discussion of the results is presented in \u00a74.\n\n2. Observations and Data Reduction\nThe joint Japan/US X-ray astronomy satellite Suzaku (Mitsuda\net al. 2007) observed \u03b2 Lyr in May 2006 on three occasions at orbital phases as shown in Fig. 1, with corresponding viewing perspectives of the \u03b2 Lyr system illustrated in Fig. 2. (Note that the\nprimary minimum occurs when the loser star is eclipsed, and the\nsecondary minimum when the disk component is eclipsed.) The\npointings were spaced approximately 4.3 days apart to sample\nthe full 12.9 day orbit of the binary. Exposure times and count\nrates are tabulated in Table 2.\n\n\f2\n\nR.

Illustration of the Suzaku pointings with respect to the\nbinary phase. The solid line represents the normalized V-band\nlight curve (Fourier fit by Harmanec et al. 1996). Primary eclipse\n(phases 0.0 and 1.0) occurs when the mass-losing star is occulted\nby the disk. The three intervals marked on the curve represent\nour Suzaku pointings, which occurred during a single orbit in\nMay 2006. Phases were calculated from the quadratic ephemeris\nof Harmanec & Scholz (1993).\n\nSuzaku carries four X-ray Imaging Spectrometers (XIS;\nKoyama et al. 2007) and a collimated Hard X-ray Detector\n(HXD; Takahashi et al. 2007). The field-of-view (FOV) for the\nXIS detectors is 17\u2032 \u00d7 17\u2032 . One of the XIS detectors (XIS1)\nis back-side illuminated (BI) and the other three (XIS0, XIS2,\nand XIS3) are front-side illuminated (FI). The bandpasses are\n\u223c 0.4 \u2013 12 keV for the FI detectors and \u223c 0.2 \u2013 12 keV for the BI\ndetector. The BI CCD has higher effective area at low energies,\n\nFig. 2. Graphic topview representation of the \u03b2 Lyr star-disk system, following the model of Hoffman et al. (1998). Components\nare illustrative and not to scale. The three Suzaku pointings occurred at phases \u03c6 = 0.24, 0.55, and 0.91 all within the same\norbit. Arrows indicate the Earth's line-of-sight for these three\nphases.\nhowever its background level across the entire bandpass is higher\ncompared to the FI CCDs.\nThe angular resolution of the X-ray telescope onboard\nSuzaku is \u2248 2\u2032 . Therefore in the XIS image, \u03b2 Lyr is not resolved from two nearby B-type stars: HD 174664 (\u03b2 Lyr B) and\nHD 174639. While the latter star was not detected by ROSAT,\nthe former has a ROSAT HRI count rate of 4 \u00d7 10\u22123 cps, as compared to the \u03b2 Lyr ROSAT HRI count rate 4 \u00d7 10\u22122 cps. We are\nconfident that the X-ray flux detected by Suzaku is at least 90%\ndominated by \u03b2 Lyr.\nThe HXD consists of two non-imaging instruments (the PIN\nand GSO; see Takahashi et al. 2007) with bandpasses of \u223c 10 \u2013\n70 keV (PIN) and \u223c 40\u2212600 keV (GSO), and a FOV of 34\u2032 \u00d7 34\u2032\n(PIN). Both of the HXD instruments are background-limited.\nThe background subtraction for the HXD is performed by modeling the background spectrum. Presently, the non-X-ray background model (e.g., particle events) is known for the PIN detector with \u223c 3-5% accuracy (Kokubun et al. 2007). The background modeling for GSO data is currently far less certain than\nfor the PIN, and so we do not report on the GSO measurements.\nHXD-PIN data reduction and extraction of spectra were\nperformed using the latest calibration sources and background\nmodels. We account for cosmic X-ray background (CXB) in\nfitting the spectral models using the procedure suggested by\nthe Suzaku team based on a \"typical\" CXB spectrum (see\nwww.astro.isas.ac.jp/suzaku). We do not correct for contributions to the HXD background due to the South Atlantic Anomaly\n(SAA; see Kokubun et al. 2007) because our observations of\n\u03b2 Lyr were performed when the background count-rate was at\nits lowest.\nBased on the Rosat All-Sky Survey (RASS), there are a few\nX-ray sources in the 34\u2032 \u00d7 34\u2032 PIN's field of view (FOV); however, our target \u03b2 Lyr is by far the brightest. The stellar coronal X-ray sources present in the FOV are expected to be faint\nin the HXD's energy range. There is also an active galactic nucleus (AGN) in the FOV about 15\u2032 away from \u03b2 Lyr. This AGN,\nQSO B1847+3330, is cataloged in the RASS with a count-rate of\n0.05 cps. To estimate its potential contribution to the 10\u221270 keV\nenergy range, we adopted a standard AGN power-law spectrum with \u0393 = 2 and a low interstellar absorption column of\n\n\fR.

Analysis\nA comparison of our three XIS spectra below 10 keV with the\nXIS detectors indicates very little variability with phase (see\nFig. 3). Based on chi-square model fits to the data, there is no evidence for statistically significant differences between the three\nspectra. For illustration a model fit for the \u03c6 = 0.24 pointing\nappears as the solid line in all three panels of Fig. 3; its good\nagreement with the data at all phases demonstrates that the soft\nX-ray spectrum of \u03b2 Lyr is nearly constant in shape and strength.\nIndependent fits for each pointing are very similar.\nThese XIS X-ray spectra are most probably thermal in nature, since emission lines are detected at 1.35 keV (Mg xi) and\n1.86 keV (Si xiii). Our fits indicate a two-component model with\nthe majority of the XIS X-ray emission arising from a temperature of \u2248 7.2 MK and a hotter but much weaker component of\n& 20 MK. Solar abundances were adopted except for nitrogen\nthat was enhanced by more than 10 times to achieve an adequate fit. The derived hydrogen column density from the model\nis NH = 6.5 \u00b1 0.24 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 , largely consistent with the interstellar value.\nHard emission in the 10\u201360 keV band of the PIN is background dominated. The observed total and the background count\nrates are given in Table 3. The source counts come from the difference of the total and background values. Based on the total\ncounts, there is a significant source detection at phase \u03c6 = 0.55, a\nnon-detection for \u03c6 = 0.91, and a marginal detection at \u03c6 = 0.24.\nEmission at such hard energies is exceptionally unusual and\nunexpected for a system like \u03b2 Lyr that consists of two earlytype stars. The implied hard X-ray luminosity above 10 keV at\n\u03c6 \u2248 0.55 is about 10\u22123 L\u2299 . If confirmed, this hard component\nwould be an important tracer of the flow geometry and shock\nstructure since the circumstellar material is quite transparent to\nsuch high energy X-rays.\n\nFig. 3. Spectra of \u03b2 Lyr from the XIS1 detector for each pointing.\nPhase within the orbit is indicated in each panel. The data are of\nreasonably high signal-to-noise, and it is clear that the spectral\ndistribution shows little change with phase, being of nearly constant brightness and spectral shape. The solid line is a model fit\nto the data of \u03c6 = 0.24 that is replotted in the other phases for\ncomparison.\n\n4. Discussion\nThe results of our Suzaku study are both revealing and perplexing. We had expected to see an eclipse of soft X-rays and essentially no hard emission. Instead, we found that the soft Xrays were nearly constant, and there is an indication of a quite\nhard emission component in the system. The near constancy of\nthe soft spectrum suggests that the X-ray source must be axially\nsymmetric. This is quite surprising, since the system is intrinsically non-axisymmetric.\nIt is worth recalling that the UV lightcurve below Ly\u03b1 is\nnotable for lacking any eclipses as well (Kondo et al. 1994). A\nsomewhat analogous source to \u03b2 Lyr is the near edge-on interacting binary W Ser. Weiland et al. (1995) interpret UV spectra of\nW Ser in terms of an extended boundary layer between the star\nand the accretion disk. Thus, it may be possible that the largely\nsteady FUV and soft X-ray emission could arise from a similar\nregion in the \u03b2 Lyr system. However, we do not currently favor\nthis explanation since the most recent modeling of the disk and\n\n\f4\n\nR. Ignace et al.: Phase-dependent X-ray observations of the \u03b2 Lyrae system:\n\nstar components of \u03b2 Lyr (Linnell 2002) indicate that gainer star\nis entirely obscured at all phases.\nAn alternative view is suggested by hydrodynamic simulations. Bisikalo et al. (2000) modeled the mass transfer of \u03b2 Lyr\nand found that they could reproduce a disk-like structure but\nwithout a well-identified \"hot spot\". Instead, their simulations\nyielded a complex distribution of extended shocks. They also\nwere able to generate a bipolar flow similar to the jet detected\nby Harmanec et al. (1996) and Hoffman et al. (1998). However,\nradiative cooling was not treated self-consistently in those simulations, but approximated through the equation of state. It is\nunclear whether this model can generate gas at sufficiently high\ntemperatures to produce the observed X-rays. Hydrodynamic\nmodeling of the \u03b2 Lyr system was also pursued by Nazarenko\n& Glazunova (2003; 2006ab), first in 2D simulations and then\nin 3D simulations. These researchers included cooling curves in\ntheir simulations and allowed for a stellar wind by the gainer.\nTheir models also lead to a disk, a bipolar flow, and an environment permeated with elongated shocks at different azimuthal orientations about the gainer. \"Warm\" gas temperatures up to about\n200,000 K are achieved, but such gas can not contribute significant emission to the X-ray band. The gas dynamical simulations\nare qualitatively promising in terms of predicting shocked structures that are spatially distributed in radius and azimuth throughout the disk. In such a model, the hot gas could potentially that\nhot gas could be viewable at every phase. However, X-ray emissions were not the focus of those studies, and it would be useful\nto have new simulations that emphasize the hot plasma structures.\nWe prefer an interpretation in which the X-rays arise\nfrom distributed shocks in the wind of the gainer star. At\nkT \u2248 0.6 keV, the spectral characteristics of the Suzaku spectra\nare compatible with a typical early main sequence B star, and the\nXIS luminosity LX (XIS) \u2248 6.6 \u00d7 1030 erg s\u22121 is commensurate\nwith the soft emission expected from an early B0-B1 star\n(Cohen, Cassinelli, & MacFarlane 1997). Although the favored\nmodel for the binary geometry may preclude a direct view of\nthe gainer star, it does permit a reasonably deep view into its\nwind, even at secondary eclipse (with the giant star at front).\nMoreover, we know from the polarimetric study of Hoffman\net al. (1998) that there is substantial scattering opacity above\nand below the disk plane. The near constancy of the X-rays seen\nwith the XIS may result from an extended \"halo\" of scattered\nX-ray light, similar in spirit to the scattered optical light\nobserved in images of some Herbig-Haro objects seen edge-on\nto their disks, such as HH 30 (Burrows et al. 1996). In this\npicture the soft X-rays ultimately originate in the shocked wind\nof the early gainer star. Part of the emission is observed directly\nfrom hot plasma at large radii in the wind, and part is scattered\ninto our line-of-sight from above and below the disk. Thus the\n0.6 keV temperature of the hot gas would represent an upper\nlimit value owing to the fact that photoabsorption of X-rays\nis more severe toward the soft end of the spectrum. On the\nother hand, the observed X-ray luminosity must be a lower limit.\nWe have considered three distinct origins for the observed\nX-ray emissions. At this point we favor the gainer wind as the\nsource of the soft X-rays, but acknowledge that future hydrodynamic modeling may change this picture. In addition, there\nseems to be an unusually hard component of emission in the system, in excess of 10 keV. Such hard emission is more typically\nassociated with compact objects, and not the winds of hot stars\n(e.g., Bergh\u00f6fer et al. 1997). However, the nature of the gainer\nis still ambiguous; perhaps the X-ray properties of \u03b2 Lyr could\n\nbe understood in relation to a central compact object (Devinney\n1971; Wilson 1971). Although this seems unlikely, the X-ray observations certainly do not conform to our original expectations,\nand so at least a reconsideration of the possibility seems in order. The X-ray pointings by Suzaku offer the tantalizing promise\nof providing new and valuable information about the \u03b2 Lyr system, but it is clear that a far more rigorous sampling of the X-ray\nlightcurve and source spectrum and new models for the system\nwill be needed to test the suppositions that we have put forth.\nWe have obtained time with the RXTE satellite to create a more\ncomplete X-ray light curve of \u03b2 Lyr, which should provide new\ninsight into this complex system in the near future.\nAcknowledgements.
