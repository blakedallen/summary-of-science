Introduction\nMeasurements of exclusive hadronic final states in two-photon collisions provide valuable information about\nthe physics of light and heavy-quark resonance production, perturbative and non-perturbative QCD and hadronproduction mechanism. For the low energy region (the two-photon center-of-mass energy range, W < 0.8 GeV), it\nis expected that different electric charges of the mesons play an essential role in the difference of the cross sections\nbetween the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 processes. Predictions are not straightforward because of non-perturbative effects. For\nthe intermediate energy region, formation of meson resonances decaying to \u03c0\u03c0 is the dominant contribution. We can\nrestrict I G J P C of the q q\u0304 mesons produced in the processes to be 0+ (even)++ , that is, fJ=even. For higher energies, we\ninvoke a quark model. In the leading order calculations [1, 2], the \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 cross section is predicted to be much smaller:\naround 0.03-0.06 of \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 . However, higher-order or non-perturbative QCD effects can modify the ratio [3]. Analyses\nof energy and angular distributions of the cross sections are also essential to test the validity of QCD models. Also\nthe \u03c7cJ charmonia are expected to contribute to this process.\nWe previously presented the differential cross section, d\u03c3/d| cos \u03b8\u2217 |, for \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 in the low and high energy\nregions [4, 5], and here we report the results for \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 for a wide two-photon center-of-mass (c.m.) energy\nrange from 0.6 to 4.0 GeV, and a c.m. angular range, | cos \u03b8\u2217 | < 0.8 based on the data from Belle with integrated\nluminosity of 95 fb\u22121 [6, 7]. We also make a preliminary discussion in the higher energy region based on the results\nfrom the integrated luminosity of 223 fb\u22121 [8], which is three orders of magnitude more of previous measurements.\n\n2. Measurement of \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0\n\n[6]\n\nWe use data collected with the Belle detector [9] at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e+ e\u2212 collider [10]. The energy\nof the accelerator was set at or near 10.58 GeV. The analysis is made in the \"zero-tag\" mode, where neither the\nrecoil electron nor positron is detected. We restrict the virtuality of the incident photons to be small by imposing a\nrequirement of a strict transverse-momentum balance along the beam axis of the final-state hadronic system.\nWe collect events with multiple photons without any reconstructed tracks triggered by activity in the electromagnetic calorimeter, where the total energy exceeding 1.15 GeV or four or more energy clusters with a threshold around\n110 MeV are required. Just two reconstructed neutral pions are required. We apply a transverse-momentum (pt )\nP\nbalance cut for the two-pion system in the e+ e\u2212 c.m. frame, | p\u2217t | < 0.05 GeV/c.\nAfter the event selection, we find about 1.26 \u00d7 106 candidates for \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 from the 95 fb\u22121 data. We can\nseparate background events using transverse-momentum distributions of the candidate events with fitting them to\nthe signal and background components. The invariant-mass resolution is estimated using signal Monte Carlo events\nand the experimental pt -balance distributions. By modeling this smearing effect of the resolution, we apply an\n\n\f1000\n\n|cos q*| < 0.8\n\ns(gg\n\np0p0) (nb)\n\n100\n\n10\n\n1\n\n0.1\n\n0.01\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\nW (GeV)\n\nFigure 1: The energy dependence of the cross section for\n\u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 integrated over the angular range in | cos \u03b8\u2217 | <\n0.8.\n\nFigure 2: Total cross section ( | cos \u03b8\u2217 | < 0.8) and results of\nparametrization. The contributions of partial components\nare described in Ref. [6].\n\nunfolding procedure to obtain the corrected invariant-mass distribution between 0.9 and 2.4 GeV for each angular\nbin.\nWe derive d\u03c3/d| cos \u03b8\u2217 | in 16 angular bins in | cos \u03b8\u2217 | < 0.8. The result after integration over the angle is shown\nin Fig. 1. Data points in the energy region where the contribution from \u03c7cJ charmonia is dominant are removed,\nbecause we cannot separate the components from \u03c7c0 , \u03c7c2 and the continuum in a model-independent way, due to\nthe finite mass resolution and insufficient statistics (they are discussed in detail in the next section).\nWe estimate the systematic errors for the integrated cross sections, considering various sources including trigger\nefficiency, background subtraction, \u03c0 0 reconstruction efficiency etc. The typical error size in the intermediate and\nhigh energy regions are 10 - 11%. The results in the energy region below 1.0 GeV have larger errors.\nWe find prominent resonant structures near 0.98 GeV, 1.27 GeV, 1.65 GeV and 1.95 GeV. The first two are\nfrom f0 (980) and f2 (1270), respectively, which are also observed in the \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 process [4]. The latter two\ncannot readily be assigned to any well-known states. A general behavior of amplitudes is studied by fitting the\ndifferential cross sections in a simple model, which includes the S, D0 and D2 waves that are parametrized as smooth\nbackground and resonances (Fig. 2). We obtain a reasonable fit with the f2 (1270) and f0 (980) consistent with previous\nmeasurements. The S wave prefers to have another resonance-like contribution in the mass region, 1.2-1.4 GeV/c2 .\n\n3. Preliminary Analyses of the higher energy region and summary\nWe show the results from preliminary analyses based on the higher statistical data sample corresponding to the\nintegrated luminosity of 223 fb\u22121 [8]. We find a signature of resonance-like structure near the \u03c7cJ charmonium\nregion, 3.3-3.6 GeV. We fit the distribution of the yield for the range 2.8 GeV< W < 4.0 GeV and | cos \u03b8\u2217 | < 0.4 with\na function including the contributions from the \u03c7c0 and \u03c7c2 and a smooth contribution from the continuum, taking\ninto account partial interference between them. The fit is shown in Fig. 3. The mass and width of the charmonia\nare fixed to the world averages [11]. We obtain the products of the two-photon decay width and the branching\nfraction, \u0393\u03b3\u03b3 (\u03c7cJ )B(\u03c7cJ \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 ) = 9.9+5.8\n\u22124.0 \u00b1 1.0 eV and 0.48 \u00b1 0.18 \u00b1 0.05 \u00b1 0.14 eV, for \u03c7c0 and \u03c7c2 , respectively.\nThe first and second errors are for statistical and systematic, respectively, and the last error for the \u03c7c2 is from\nthe uncertainty of the interference of the \u03c7c2 with the continuum component. These results are in agreement with\nthe corresponding world averages [11] and the charged pion-pair decays from our measurement [5], taking isospin\ninvariance into account.\nWe show the cross section ratio between \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 and \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 [5] for | cos \u03b8\u2217 | < 0.6 and 2.4 GeV <\nW < 4.1 GeV, in Fig. 4(a).

The data points of \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 above the charmonium masses have larger\nsystematic error, \u223c 25%. Subtractions of the charmonium components are applied for these plots.\nThe cross-section ratio, neutral to charged, seems to have no big energy dependence for W > 2.7 GeV and has an\naverage ratio \u03c3(\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 )/\u03c3(\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) = 0.32 \u00b1 0.03 \u00b1 0.05. This ratio is larger than the prediction from the lowest-order\nQCD calculation [1, 2]. The angular distributions are also studied in the energy range above 1.4 GeV, and some\nimplications to a spin-4 resonance and QCD models are discussed.\nTo summarize, we have measured the cross section of the process \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 for the c.m. energy and angular\nregions, 0.60 GeV < W < 4.1 GeV and | cos \u03b8\u2217 | < 0.8. We observe some resonant structures, including the f0 (980)\nand \u03c7c0 . The ratio of the cross sections of \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 and \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 in the 3 GeV region is obtained.\n\nReferences\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n\nS.J.
