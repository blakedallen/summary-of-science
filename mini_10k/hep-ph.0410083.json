At that time there, however, no good data was\navailable for constraining details of the model. In recent\nyears a body of data from \u03c0N and KN scattering has\nbeen collected (see for instance [7]). In particular the\nZEUS and H1 collaborations at HERA have measured\ndiffractive production of the \u03c10 meson. Most of the theoretical effort, however, concentrated on the description\nof the total cross section in different pQCD inspired approaches and not on the description of the two-pion continuum invariant mass distribution.\nIn real photoproduction the ZEUS collaboration observed a strong asymmetry in the two-pion invariant mass\nspectrum around the peak position [8] of the \u03c10 . In electroptoduction the asymmetry seems to decrease with increasing photon virtuality [9], Q2 and momentum transfer t\u2032 = |t \u2212 tmin | [10]. One would expect, whatever the\nnon-resonant mechanism might be, that it will also be\npresent at small Q2 and small t\u2032 and thus needed to isolate the \u03c10 production cross section.\nThe GlueX (Hall D) project at the Jefferson Lab will\nstudy mesonic resonances focusing on gluonic excitations.\nThe diffractive production of charged meson continuum\nmay produce large backgrounds to the channels of interest. Recently exotic J P C = 1\u2212+ candidates have been\nreported by the E852 [11] and the Crystall Barrel [12] collaborations. Candidates for the exotic states are rather\n\nbroad [11, 12] and may indeed have a large component\noriginating from production of the meson continuum production [13, 14].\nRecently the FOCUS collaboration at Fermilab found\na new state in the K+ K\u2212 final state at 1.75 GeV [15]\nwich may also require a good understanding of the K K\u0304,\ncontinuum production.\nIn the present paper we study the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and K + K \u2212\nchannels. In this case model ingredients are well constrained by the \u03c0N and KN data. The \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 invariant\nmass distribution and possible \u03c0 + \u2212\u03c0 \u2212 polar angle asymmetries are presently being analyzed by the COMPASS\ncollaboration [16]. We also compare the results of our\ncalculation with the experimental data at higher energies\nfrom HERA and medium energy relevant for the future\nGlueX/Hall D experiment at TJNAF.\nThe inclusive production of heavy charmed mesons in\nelectro- or pho-production off proton is routinely used to\nstudy the gluon distribution in the nucleon. The standard QCD approach is based on the production of heavy\nquark \u2013 heavy antiquark pairs at the parton level from\nphoton-gluon fusion followed by a fragmentation to heavy\nflavored hadrons. The formalism which we present for\ndiffractive production of pairs of light charged mesons\nshould be also valid for the production of pairs of heavy\nmesons, D+ D\u2212 or even B + B \u2212 . This may be interesting\nin the context of a deficit in the open bb\u0304 production in\nphoton-proton [20] and photon-photon [21] collisions.\nRecently the FOCUS collaboration has analyzed the\nazimuthal correlations between DD\u0304 mesons [22]. It was\n\n\f2\npointed out very recently [23] that heavy meson correlations are very useful to study unintegrated gluon distributions in the nucleon. To the best of our knowledge,\nthe contribution of the diffractive mechanism, discussed\nhere, has not been estimated in this context. It is also interesting to investigate how large the diffractive production of B + B \u2212 pairs might be, compared to the standard\npQCD mechanism of bb\u0304 production discussed above. In\nphotoproduction, one would naively expect a relative enhancement of the ratio of diffractive B + B \u2212 (charge 1) to\nthe standard bb\u0304 (charge 1/3) production as compared to\nthe ratio of the D+ D\u2212 (charge 1) to the cc\u0304 (charge 2/3)\nproduction by a factor of 4 in the cross section. A better\nunderstanding requires, however, more detailed insight\ninto the dynamics of the process. In the present paper\nwe shall present estimates of such contributions. In particular, we discuss several aspects of the opposite-charge\npseudoscalar continuum in photoproduction.\n\nd\u03c3 = (2\u03c0)4 \u03b4 4 (q + p \u2212 p+ \u2212 p\u2212 \u2212 p\u2032 )\n\n2(s \u2212 m2p ) and for a three-body reaction the amplitude\n[M] carries dimension of GeV\u22121 . The unpolarized cross\nsection is a function of the following variables, the square\nof the center of mass energy, s = (q + p)2 , the two-meson\n2\ninvariant mass, MMM , MMM\n= (k+ + k\u2212 )2 , the fourmomentum transfer squared in the nucleon, t = (p \u2212 p\u2032 )2\nand the polar and azimuthal angles, \u03a9 = (\u03b8, \u03c6) specifying\nthe direction of momentum of one of the two produced\nmesons in the the two-meson recoil center of mass (RCM)\nsystem. The coordinates of the RCM system are usually\nchosen such that the y axis is perpendicular to the production plane determined by the photon and the recoil\nnucleon momenta, and z is chosen either in the direction\nof the photon momentum (in the RCM system), which\n\n+\n\n\u2212\n\np\n\nII.\n\nMODEL OF THE CONTINUUM\n\nThe dominant mechanisms of diffractive production of\nopposite-charge meson pairs are shown in Fig.1. The\ncontinuum production shown by the diagrams (a) and\n(b) in Fig.1 is often a background to direct resonance\n(\u03c10 , \u03c6, f2 , etc.) production shown in diagram (c). We\nshall refer to (a)-(b) and (c) as the continuum and resonance contributions, respectively. The zigzag line represents the pomeron and subleading reggeon exchanges.\nThe cross section for diffractive photoproduction of the\nopposite charge meson pairs, can be written as\n\nd3 p\u2212\nd3 p\u2032\n1\nd3 p+\n\u00d7\n|M\u03b3p\u2192M + M \u2212 p |2 ,\n3\n3\n2\u03c9+ (2\u03c0) 2\u03c9\u2212 (2\u03c0) 2\u03c9 \u2032 (2\u03c0)3\nf lux\n\nq\nwhere for photoproduction, f lux = 4 (p * q)2 \u2212 m2p q 2 =\n\nM\nM\u03bb\u03b3p\u2192M\n\u2032\n\u03b3 \u03bb\u2192\u03bb\n\nWe note that a similar model has been recently applied\nto describe \u03c0\u03c0 and K K\u0304 photoproduction in Ref.[18].\n\n(s, t, s+ , t+ , s\u2212 , t\u2212 ) == V\u03b3M + (\u03bb\u03b3 )\n\nis then referred to as the Gottfried-Jackson (GJ), or z\nis anti-parallel to the recoiling nucleon direction, which\ndefines the so called s-channel helicity (SCH).

It\ncomes form the non-point-like nature of the exchanged\n\n(9)\n\n(10)\n\nparticles which introduces the from factors, Fos 6= 1\nand from the difference in meson-nucleon scattering for\nthe two charged mesons. The later implies that electromagnetic charge flows differently in M + p \u2192 M + p and\nM \u2212 p \u2192 M \u2212 p subprocesses and since photon couples to\nall charge currents there has to be a correction which\nreflects this difference.\nHaving identified the two sources which contribute to\nthe current we can unambiguously find the required corrections.

In the present approach we assume\nthe same slope parameter for the resonance and continuum contributions, B\u03c1p = B\u03c0p \u2261 B. Except for the\noff-shell dependence determined by the form factors Fos\nour model is essentially parameter free.

The exponential form is useful as the universal parameter \u039bos for different meson exchanges can\nbe used. In the monopole parametrization Mos > mM ,\ni.e. different cut-off parameters for different exchanges\nhave to be used. On the other hand the monopole form\nseems to be preferred, because at small virtualities vector\ndominance applies and in addition it produces a correct\npQCD dependence at large virtualities.\nThe off-shell form factor is the least know element of\nour model. In Figs.4, 5 we present spectral shape (resonance + continuum) for the two choices of from factors\nwithout and with rotation from SCH to GJ frame. Somewhat better agreement is obtained without performing\nthe extra rotation of arguments.\n\nFIG. 4: The spectrum of invariant mass M\u03c0\u03c0 for W = 70 GeV\nfor exponential and monopole off-shell form factor without\nrotation of continuum arguments. The experimental results\nof the ZEUS collaboration are from [8]. In this calculation B\n= 8 GeV\u22122 .\n\nThe spectral shape depends on the value of the form\nfactor parameter (\u039bos = 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 GeV for the exponential form factor, and Mos = 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 GeV for the\nmonopole form factor). For pion production very similar\nresults are obtained with exponential and monopole form\nfactors for \u039bos \u2248 Mos . Therefore, having in view a possible universality of the exponential off-shell form factor\nparameter \u039bos , we shall use the exponential form factor\nin the following.

The coherent sum of\nthe resonance and continuum (solid line) differs considerably from the standard resonance shape which is shown\nin Fig.6. The resonance contribution alone (dashed line)\ngives a poor description of the data. In particular, the\nposition of the maximum is at higher m\u03c0\u03c0 then observed\nexperimentally. These features have been often ignored\nin the literature and only integrated cross section were\nused to compare with theoretical calculations.\nIn order to have a better insight into the origins of the\nline-shape modifications in Fig.7 we show separately the\nresonance and the continuum contributions in somewhat\nbroader range of two-pion invariant mass. This figure\nclearly demonstrates that it is mainly the interference\n\neffect which deforms the spectral shape of the \u03c1 meson.\nIn our approach the background is described by a\nphysical process which has a strong two-pion invariant mass dependence. Often in experimental analyses\n[8, 9, 10] (see also [27]), this background is parametrized\nwith a weak \u03c0\u03c0 mass dependence. We do not expect\nthat our model could describe the experimental spectra above M\u03c0\u03c0 > 1 GeV, since there will be important\ncontributions from higher mass two-pion resonances e.g.\nf2 (1270), \u03c13 (1690), \u03c1(1700). The situation there may\nbe therefore rather complicated and we leave the corresponding analysis for future investigations.\nIn order to further understand the large interference\neffect of the continuum contribution with the P -wave resonance we performed a decomposition of the continuum\namplitude into the partial wave series in the GJ frame,\n+\n\nM\nM\u03bb\u03b3p\u2192M\n\u2032\n\u03b3 ,\u03bb\u2192\u03bb\n\n\u2212\n\np\n\n(t, M\u03c0\u03c0 , \u03b8, \u03c6) =\nX \u03bb ,\u03bb,\u03bb\u2032\n=\nalm\u03b3\n(t, M\u03c0\u03c0 ) Ylm (\u03b8, \u03c6).\nl,m\n\n(33)\nThe expansion coefficients can be calculated as\n\u03bb ,\u03bb,\u03bb\u2032\n\nalm\u03b3\n(t, M\u03c0\u03c0 ) =\nZ\n+\nM\u2212p\n\u2217\n= Ylm\n(\u03b8, \u03c6) * M\u03bb\u03b3p\u2192M\n(t, M\u03c0\u03c0 , \u03b8, \u03c6) d\u03a9.\n\u2032\n\u03b3 ,\u03bb\u2192\u03bb\n(34)\n\n\f8\n\nFIG. 7: The decomposition of the spectrum of the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212\ninvariant mass M\u03c0\u03c0 for W = 70 GeV.

This explains the large interference between the continuum and resonance production.\nWe also find a relatively large contribution of the F -wave.\nThe individual contributions of l = 1 and l = 3 partial\nwave are shown in Fig.8.\nPresence of the F -wave is interesting in the context of\nforward-backward asymmetry and the moment analysis\n(see e.g.[19]). These are usually discussed in terms of the\nS- and P - wave interferences. Our analysis shows that in\nprinciple one needs to include S, P, D and F waves into\nsuch an analysis even for relatively low invariant masses.\nLet us try to understand this hierarchy of the partial wave amplitudes. The angular distribution originates\nfrom\nM\u03bb\u03b3p\u2192M\n\u03b3\n\n+\n\nM\u2212p\n\n(t, MMM , \u03b8, \u03c6)\n\u221d qMM iF (t) exp(\u00b1i\u03c6) sin \u03b8A(\u03b8, \u03c6),\n(36)\n\n\u03c3M \u2212 p (s\u2212 (\u03b8, \u03c6))Fos (t+ (\u03b8))\n1 \u2212 \u03b2 cos \u03b8\n\u03c3M + p (s+ (\u03b8, \u03c6))Fos (t\u2212 (\u03b8))\n.\n+\n1 + \u03b2 cos \u03b8\n\nA(\u03b8, \u03c6) =\n\n(37)\n\nIt then becomes obvious that it is the function A(\u03b8, \u03c6)\nwhich is responsible for generation of partial waves different than l = 1. It is easy to show that if the numerators\nwere identical the S-wave amplitude would vanish. The\nsmooth energy dependence of the cross sections introduces a small S-wave contribution. This small effect is\nslightly dependent on the incident energy.\nThe large interference effect is specific to the photoproduction of P -wave resonances and the P -wave dominated\npseudoscalar meson continuum.\nIn Fig.9 we discuss the evolution of the spectral shape\n(asymmetry) as a function of the momentum transfer, |t|.\nWhile at low |t| the spectral asymmetry is reversed compared to the standard resonant shape at large |t| one observes a restoration of the standard asymmetry expected\nfor the P -wave resonance. Such an effect was observed\nexperimentally in [10] and to the best of our knowledge\nthe dynamics of this effect has not been given before.\nSo far we have neglected the final state \u03c0\u03c0 interaction.\nThis can be restored by modifying the continuum partialwave amplitudes,\n\u03bb ,\u03bb,\u03bb\u2032\n\n\u00e3lm\u03b3\n\n\u03bb ,\u03bb,\u03bb\u2032\n\n= alm\u03b3\n\ncos \u03b4l\u03c0\u03c0 exp(i\u03b4l\u03c0\u03c0 ) .\n\n(38)\n\nHere \u03b4l\u03c0\u03c0 is the M\u03c0\u03c0 -dependent phase shift for \u03c0\u03c0 scattering in the l'th partial wave.

For\nl = 1 the final amplitude can be written as a sum of three\nterms: the direct \u03c10 production, free meson pair production and the resonance production via re-scattering.\nThe last two are contained in Eq.(39) (or Eq.(38)). We\nchecked that re-scattering from the continuum back to\nthe resonance is negligible.\nThe K + K \u2212 production is more sensitive to the choice\nof the off-shell form factor. The spectrum of two-kaon\ninvariant mass is shown in Fig.10 for exponential form\nfactor and \u039bos = 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 GeV.\nRecent experimental data from the FOCUS collaboration are shown for comparison [15]. Our model of diffractive production of kaonic pairs gives a good description of\nthe main trend of the data. A direct comparison with the\nFOCUS data is, however, not possible, because the experimental acceptance is known only in very limited range of\nthe phase space. The absolutely normalized experimental invariant mass distribution would help to better limit\nthe only unknown parameter \u039bos (or Mos ) of the off-shell\nform factor. The situation may be, however, not so simple in light of resent experimental data for \u03b3\u03b3 collisions\n[17]. In principle, similarly as for the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 invariant\nmass the interference of the K + K \u2212 continuum and the\n\u03c6 resonance takes place. However, because the \u03c6 has a\n\nThe angular distributions depend on the invariant\nmass. Thus one studies angular distributions in bins of\ninvariant masses.

The angular distribution is almost pro2\nportional to (sin \u03b8) . The continuum contribution only\nslightly modifies the (sin \u03b8)2 resonance distribution. The\nresults with or without rotation between the frames are\nalmost indistinguishable.\nIn Fig.12 we present predictions for angular distributions for the GlueX experiment at TJNAF. The shape of\nthe distributions depends on the interval of the two-pion\ninvariant mass. The effect of the rotation of the arguments of the continuum is stronger for smaller invariant\nmasses. We predict a sizable asymmetry with, \u03c0 + being\npreferentially emitted in the forward (photon) direction.\nThe function A(\u03b8, \u03c6) in Eq.(36) is responsible not\nonly for generating higher partial waves but also for the\nforward-backward asymmetry.

A sizable asymmetry can be seen in the GJ frame (solid lines).

The sold line corresponds to the case of\nno extra rotation while dashed line corresponds to the result\nwith the extra rotation.\n\nbackward directions. Even at W = 70 GeV the asymmetry is of the order of 1%. In our model the asymmetry is caused by the different interaction of \u03c0 + p and \u03c0 \u2212 p\n(analogously for K + p and K \u2212 p). This is caused by a different strength of sub-leading reggeons. The asymmetry\ndisappears at large energy where the dynamics of elastic scattering is governed exclusively by the pomeron exchange. The asymmetry discussed above is an important\ntest of the diffractive mechanism. When transformed to\nthe SCH frame the asymmetry becomes rather negligible\n(dashed lines).\nIn Refs.[32, 33] the observation of forward-backward\nasymmetry of charged pions was proposed in order to pin\ndown the odderon exchange. These analyses were based\non the assumption that only resonant mechanisms plays\na role. The mechanism considered here was not taken\ninto account. Our diffractive mechanism may mimic\nthe pomeron-odderon interference effects discussed in\nRefs.[32, 33]. A careful search for the odderon exchange\nmust therefore necessarily include the two-pion continuum discussed in the present paper.\nWe expect that the diffractive production of K + K \u2212 is\nthe dominant mechanism well above the \u03c6 resonance. In\nFig.14 we present angular distributions of K + in the GJ\nrecoil center of mass system for a typical FOCUS energy,\nW = 10 GeV for different bins of MKK specified in the\nfigure.\nAs for the pion production we obtain asymmetric distributions with K + being preferentially emitted in the\nforward hemisphere. The shape of the angular distribution changes with MKK . The shape is very important\n\n\f11\n\n(a)\n\nFIG. 14: The angular distribution of K + in the GJ frame for\na typical FOCUS energy W = 10 GeV.

The solid line corresponds to the continuum in\nthe GJ, while the dashed line to the continuum in the SCH\nframe. The kinematical cuts are specified in the text.\n\nwhen studying resonances. For example, the FOCUS\ncollaboration found difficulties in spin assignment of the\nX(1750) [31]. This may partially be due to the interference of the resonance and the continuum. In general,\nthe larger the invariant mass, the more the cross section\npeaks at forward/backward directions. This is related to\nthe increase in the number of active partial waves with\nthe increasing subsystem energy.\nIn Fig.15 we present AF B for K + for four different\nincident energies, 1.9 GeV < MKK < 2.1 GeV and |t| < 1\nGeV2 . We observe much larger asymmetries than for the\n\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 case. This is partially due to larger asymmetries\nin K + p and K \u2212 p scattering than for the \u03c0 + p and \u03c0 \u2212 p\nscattering.\nIn principle the K + K \u2212 asymmetry should be seen\nin the data of the FOCUS collaboration. The possible higher mass resonance contributions are expected to\nlower the asymmetry. A careful search for the asymmetry as a function of the two-kaon invariant mass would\nbe very interesting in searches for new states.\n\nFIG. 15: Forward-backward asymmetry for K + production in\nthe GJ frame as the function of cos\u03b8 for four different energies:\nW = 4, 10, 20, 70 GeV.

We show results for different values of the scale\nparameter in the exponential off-shell form factor. The\nabsolute normalization strongly depends on the value of\nthe form factor mass parameter. This is due to the fact\nthat the intermediate meson D in Fig.1 is far from its\nmass shell. Our distributions peak at MDD = 4.5\u20135\nGeV.

The expected statistics will be of course\nrather low, of the order of 10-50 events.\nThe invariant mass distribution for the B + B \u2212 pair\nproduction is shown in Fig.17 for a typical HERA energy W = 100 GeV. Here there is a dramatic effect on\nthe value of the form factor parameter. The distribution\nreaches its maximum at rather high MBB . The smallness of the cross sections precludes, however, studies of\ndifferential cross section.\nIn Figs.18, 19 we show the energy dependence of the\nintegrated cross section for both DD and BB pair production (thick solid line). For comparison we show the\nstandard collinear-factorization results for open charm\nand open bottom production [34] as well as the experimental cross sections. As can be seen from the figure the\ndiffractive cross section is much smaller than its counterpart for the standard photon-gluon fusion followed by\nfragmentation.\nIn addition, the rise of the cross section with energy\nis slower then for the photon-gluon fusion. Only close\nto the kinematical threshold the diffractive component\nmay constitute a sizable fraction of the open heavy-flavor\ncomponent. Since in this case application of the mesonexchange approach is less reliable than for the light pairs,\nan experimental measurement would be very interesting\nand helpful to discriminate between models. While for\nthe D+ D\u2212 pairs this may be feasible, it will be hard\nto expect such an analysis for the B + B \u2212 pairs, at least\nin a few year perspective. We predict the fraction of\ndiffractive-to-nondiffractive events to be somewhat larger\nfor bottom than for charm mesons.\n\nFIG. 18: The energy dependence of the integrated cross section for the diffractive photoproduction of D+ D\u2212 (thick solid\nline) with our estimate of the upper limit (\u039bos = 2 GeV).\nFor comparison we show the cross section for open charm\nand bottom production (dash-dotted line) and corresponding\nexperimental data. The details concerning the open heavyflavour production can be found in Ref.[34].\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have presented a model of diffractive photoproduction of opposite-charge pseudoscalar mesons. The model\nshould be valid at sufficiently high energies, down to energies relevant at the future experiments in Hall D at\n\n\f13\n\nFIG. 19: Same as in Fig. 18 for B + B \u2212 production, (\u039bos =\n4 GeV).\n\nJefferson Lab. The understanding of the two-meson continua is absolutely crucial when looking for new (exotic)\nmesonic states in the two-meson channels. Our model results seem to be consistent with the current experimental\ndata.\nThe interference of the two-pion continuum and the\nresonant \u03c10 contribution leads to a significant deformation of the resonance peak, which is consistent with\nthe experimental data from the ZEUS collaboration at\nHERA [8]. The effect of the continuum-resonance interference is often completely neglected. We explain a\nchange of the spectral shape of the \u03c10 bump with momentum transfer.\nThe diffractive mechanism of the K + K \u2212 production leads to a broad bump in invariant mass distribution, above the \u03c6 meson position with the maximum at\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n\nS.D.

Experimentally, except for the X(1750)\nmentioned earlier no clear resonances in the K + K \u2212 channel have been seen in [15] e.g. even though states like a2 ,\nf2 , \u03c13 are expected. A careful phase-shift analysis will\nbe required to separate them. Our model amplitude provides a reasonably well controlled background for such\nstudies.\nWe have found a forward-backward asymmetry in \u03c0 +\nand \u03c0 \u2212 (similarly K + and K \u2212 ) recoil center of mass\nangular distributions. The new effect is due to different interaction of different-charge mesons with the proton. The effect disappears at large incident energies,\nwhere the pomeron exchange is dominant. This asymmetry may be very important in the context of recently\nproposed searches for odderon exchange via forwardbackward charge asymmetry in the region of M\u03c0\u03c0 \u223c 1\n\u2013 2 GeV.\nThe cross sections for diffractive production of heavy\nmeson pairs were neither calculated nor measured in the\npast. In the present paper we have presented an estimates of the corresponding cross sections. The cross\nsections obtained in our analysis are, however, very\nsmall. Even a measurement of integrated cross section for\ndiffractive D+ D\u2212 pair photoproduction would be very\nuseful for testing the mechanism of diffractive production. Such data would allow one to pin down off-shell\neffects for the intermediate (exchanged) heavy meson.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank Ryan Mitchell for providing us the experimental two-kaon invariant mass distribution of the FOCUS collaboration.
