LOINGER\nDipartimento di Fisica, Universit\u00e0 di Milano\nVia Celoria, 16 \u2212 20133 Milano, Italy\n\nSummary. \u2212 A rigorous, non-perturbative proof that there is no radiation damping of\ngravitational motions.\n\nPACS. 04.30. \u2212 Gravitational waves and radiation: theory.\n\n1. \u2212 It is commonly believed that any accelerated point mass sends forth gravity\nwaves [1], and that the emission of these waves generates a damping force on the\nparticle [2].\nI shall now demonstrate that any gravitational motion of any point mass\ndoes not give origin to any damping term. (But without damping ...).\nThe proof is straightforward. As is well known [3], the so-called geodesic\nprinciple is an analytical consequence of vanishing of the covariant divergence\n\nT jk ; j of mass tensor T jk , together with the assumption that the mass tensor\nrepresents a continuous, incoherent \"cloud of dust\", i.e. that\n(1.1)\n\nT jk = \u03c1u j u k , (j, k = 0, 1, 2, 3), (c=1),\n\nwhere \u03c1 (Fock's \u03c1*) is the invariant mass density and u j is the four-velocity\n\ndx j ds . Passing to the limit of a concentrated mass ([3], [4]), one deduces that\n(1.2)\n\ndu j\n+ \u0393 j lk u l u k = 0\nds\n\npage 1 of 4\n\n,\n\n\fLOINGER A., NON-EXISTENCE OF RADIATION DAMPING OF GRAVITATIONAL MOTIONS\n\ni.e. the geodesic equations of a particle. The \u0393's represent the gravity \"proper\nforce\" created by the gravitational field of the mass point. Of course, we can add\nto it an external \"gravity force\".\nNow, any geodesic line, solution of eqs. (1.2), can be written in the form\n\ny j = a js + b j ,\n\n(1.3)\n\nwhere the y's are Riemann-Fermi co-ordinates, and a j , b j are integration\nconstants. As we see, no damping force has influenced the motion.\nThe supposed emission mechanism of gravity radiation is a trigger which\nfails.\n(A Minkowskian analogue: from the conservation equations\n\n(1.4)\n\n\u2202 (\u03c1u j u k )\n=0\n\u2202x j\n\nit follows the law of rectilinear and uniform motion of a \"dust\" particle.)\n\n2. \u2212 The above considerations can be extended quite generally to any mass\ntensor. The equations\n(2.1)\n\nT jk ; j = 0\n\ngive not only the differential covariant form of the energy-momentum\nconservation of matter, but also its equations of motion. The reason of this\nproperty is very simple: in general relativity the motion of matter is a \"natural\",\n\"free\" motion in a curved space-time, created by the matter itself. The plain case\nof sect.1 is a good exemplification. In other terms, equations (2.1) represent, as it\nwere, a sort of general geodesic principle. Consequently, the motion of matter\ncannot generate any radiation damping. An electromagnetic analogy is given by\nthe rectilinear and uniform motions of charge distributions in a Minkowski\nspace-time.\npage 2 of 4\n\n\fLOINGER A., NON-EXISTENCE OF RADIATION DAMPING OF GRAVITATIONAL MOTIONS\n\nIn 1981 Papapetrou and Linet [5] considered a bounded distribution of\nperfect fluid in slow motion (v << c), under the assumption that the gravity field\nis weak everywhere. They solved the problem approximately, with a perturbative\nmethod, by choosing Minkowski space-time as background world. These authors\nused eqs. (2.1) to determine, at each stage of perturbative expansion, the radiation\nreaction force on the fluid. They found a non-zero value for this force after the\npost-post-Newtonian approximation. I affirm that their result is deceptive, it is\ndue entirely to the perturbative treatment, exactly as in Scheidegger's treatment\n[2]. (The approximation methods which start from a given, \"rigid\" metric are not\nalways reliable because they violate a fundamental characteristic of general\nrelativity [6]).\nOur conclusion could be foreseen: the hypothetical gravity waves do not\npossess energy and momentum, and therefore their supposed emission cannot\ngenerate any reaction force [7].\nThe\n\nMichelson\n\ninterferometer\n\ngave\n\nthe\n\ndecisive\n\nexperimental\n\nconfirmation of the non-existence of the cosmic ether, it will give the decisive\nexperimental confirmation of the non-existence of the gravitational radiation [8].\n\n\"Lang ist die Zeit, es ereignet sich aber das Wahre.\"\nFrom H\u00f6lderlin's Mnemosyne\n\npage 3 of 4\n\n\fLOINGER A., NON-EXISTENCE OF RADIATION DAMPING OF GRAVITATIONAL MOTIONS\n\nREFERENCES\n\n[1] See e.g. BERGMANN P.G., Introduction to the Theory of Relativity, (Prentice-Hall,\nEnglewood Cliffs, N.Y.) 1960, p.187.\n[2] See e.g. SCHEIDEGGER A.E., Revs. Mod. Phys., 25 (1953) 451. However, at p.466 of\nthis article we read: \"... having explicitly shown that all the radiation terms\nwhatsoever can be destroyed by coordinate transformations, one observes that the\nterms that had been found by straightforward calculations must be entirely due to the\nparticular choice of the coordinate system. Thus, there is no radiation damping of\ngravitational motion.\" With tedious perturbative computations, this author\ndemonstrated a thesis that in the present paper is proved rigorously and generally.\n[3] See e.g. FOCK V., The Theory of Space, Time and Gravitation, Second Revised\nEdition (Pergamon Press, Oxford, etc.) 1964, sect.63.\n[4] In lieu of (1.1) we could use equivalently a mass tensor involving a Dirac deltadistribution, see INFELD L., Acta Phys.
