INTRODUCTION\n\nGround-state magnetization curves of low-dimensional\nquantum spin systems have been attracting much recent\ninterest due to their nontrivial appearance contrasting\nwith classical behaviors. A few years ago there appeared\nan epochal argument [1] in the field. Generalizing the\nLieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem [2,3], Oshikawa, Yamanaka,\nand Affleck proposed that magnetization plateaux of\nquantum spin chains should be quantized as\nSunit \u2212 m = integer ,\n\n(1.1)\n\nwhere Sunit is the sum of spins over all sites in the unit\nperiod and m is the magnetization M divided by the\nnumber of the unit cells. Their argument caused renewed interest [4] in the pioneering calculations [5\u20137] of a\nbond-trimerized spin- 21 chain and further stimulated extensive investigations into quantum magnetization process. Quantized magnetization plateaux were reasonably\ndetected for spin- 21 [8], spin-1 [9\u201311], and spin- 23 [12,13]\nchains with modulated and/or anisotropic interactions.\nTotsuka [14], Cabra and Grynberg [15], and Honecker\n[16] developed calculations of general polymerized spin\nchains. Numerous authors have been making further\ntheoretical explorations into extended systems including\nspin ladders [17\u201320] and layered magnets [21\u201323]. Experimental observations [24,25] have also followed.\nMixed-spin chains, which have vigorously been studied\nin recent years [26\u201336], also stimulate us in this context.\nTheoretical investigations into them are all the more\ninteresting and important considering an accumulated\nchemical knowledge on ferrimagnetic materials. Kahn\net al. [37] succeeded in synthesizing a series of bimetallic chain compounds such as MM\u2032 (pba)(H2 O)3 *2H2 O\n(pba = 1, 3-propylenebis(oxamato) = C7 H6 N2 O6 )\nand MM\u2032 (pbaOH)(H2 O)3 (pbaOH = 2-hydroxy-1, 3propylenebis(oxamato) = C7 H6 N2 O7 ), where the alternating magnetic ions M and M\u2032 are flexible variables\nand therefore the low-dimensional ferrimagnetic behavior could systematically be observed. Caneschi et al.\n\nH=\n\nN\nX\n\u0002\n\n(1 + \u03b4)(S j * sj )\u03b1 + (1 \u2212 \u03b4)(sj * S j+1 )\u03b1\n\nj=1\n\n\u0003\n\u2212 H(Sjz + szj ) ,\n\n(1.2)\n\nwith (S * s)\u03b1 = S x sx + S y sy + \u03b1S z sz , is so interesting\nas to possibly exhibit a series of quantized magnetization\nplateaux at m = 21 (1), 32 (2), * * * , S + s \u2212 1, its magnetization curves have not systematically been studied so\nfar. In spite of the vigorous argument, there are few reports on multi-plateau magnetization curves. It is true\nthat a double-plateau structure lies in NH4 CuCl3 [21,25],\nbut it is owing to the variety of exchange interactions.\nWe here demonstrate that the ferrimagnetic chain (1.2)\ngenerally exhibits a 2s-plateau magnetization curve without any anisotropy and any bond polymerization, namely,\neven at \u03b1 = 1 and \u03b4 = 0. We believe that the present calculations will accelerate physical measurements on vast\nferrimagnetic chain compounds lying unexploited in the\nfield of both inorganic and organic chemistry.\nThe ground state of the isotropic Hamiltonian (1.2)\nwithout the Zeeman term, which is a multiplet of spin\n(S \u2212 s)N , exhibits elementary excitations of two distinct\ntypes [40]. The excitations of ferromagnetic aspect, reducing the ground-state magnetization, form a gapless\ndispersion relation, whereas those of antiferromagnetic\n1\n\n\fWith E(N, M ) being the lowest energy in the subspace\nwith a fixed magnetization M for the Hamiltonian (1.2)\nwithout the Zeeman term, the upper and lower bounds\nof the field which induces the ground-state magnetization\nM are expressed as\n\naspect, enhancing the ground-state magnetization, are\ngapped from the ground state. Therefore we can readily\nunderstand the initial step at m = S \u2212 s in the magnetization curve. In the Ising limit \u03b1 \u2192 \u221e, the initial\nplateau is nothing but the gapped excitation from the\nN\u00e9el-ordered state. The classical gap-generation mechanism is unique. Thus any magnetization curve in the\nIsing limit only has a single plateau. The scenario is\nqualitatively unchanged for an arbitrary \u03b1 as long as we\nconsider the classical vectors S j and sj of magnitude S\nand s instead of quantum spins. Therefore, the second\nand higher plateaux, if any, should generally be based on\na quantum mechanism.\n\nH\u00b1 (N, M ) = \u00b1E(N, M \u00b1 1) \u2213 E(N, M ) .\n\nThe length of the plateau with the unit-cell magnetization m \u2261 M/N is obtained as\n\u2206N (m) = H+ (N, M ) \u2212 H\u2212 (N, M ) .\n\nm\n1\n\n(a) (1,1/2)\n\n(c) (3/2,1)\n\n\u03b1=0.0\n\u03b1=0.4\n\u03b1=0.6\n\u03b1=1.0\n\n\u03b1=-0.6\n\u03b1= 0.0\n\u03b1= 1.0\n\n(b) (3/2,1/2)\n\n(2.2)\n\nTherefore, calculating E(N, M ) at each sector of M and\nextrapolating the resultant H\u00b1 (N, M ) with respect to\nN , we can obtain the thermodynamic-limit magnetization curves. Since the correlation length of the present\nsystem is considerably small [29,42], this scaling analysis\nworks very well. The precision of the obtained magnetization curves is generally down to three decimal places.\nThere is at most slight uncertainty in the second decimal\nplace.\n\n2\n\n\u03b1=-0.8\n\u03b1= 0.0\n\u03b1= 1.0\n\n(2.1)\n\n0\n3\n\nm\n2\n\nIII.

Hence we here concentrate\non the uniform-bond case (\u03b4 = 0). Surprisingly, in a\ncertain region of \u03b1 including the Heisenberg point, the\nspin-(S, s) chain generally possesses a 2s-plateau magnetization curve. To the best of our knowledge, this is the\nfirst report on the multi-plateau structure depending on\nneither anisotropy nor bond polymerization. 2s plateaux\nappear, but still, that does not mean the plateaux are\ndominated only by the smaller spin. Ferrimagnets have\nboth ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic features [45].\nThe mixed aspect is explicitly exhibited, for instance, in\ntheir thermodynamics, where the specific heat and the\nmagnetic susceptibility times temperature behave like\nT 1/2 and T \u22121 at low temperatures, respectively, whereas\nthey exhibit a Schottky-like peak and a round minimum\nat intermediate temperatures. Figure 2(b), as well as Fig.\n2(a), shows that the spin amplitude S \u2212 s plays the ferromagnetic role, while 2s plays the antiferromagnetic one\n\nferrimagnet\n\n(1,1/2)\n\n(3/2,1/2)\n\n(3/2,1)\n\n(2,1)\n\nferromagnetic\n} contribution = S-s\n} antiferromagnetic\nS s S s S s S s contribution = 2s\nS/s\n\nS/s\n\n1\n\nantiferromagnet\n\n(a)\n\n(3.1)\n\noo\n\nferromagnet\n\n(b)\n\nFIG. 2.

NUMERICAL PROCEDURE\n\nWe perform a scaling analysis [41] on the numerically\ncalculated energy spectra of finite clusters up to N = 12.\n2\n\n\f[46]. Considering that any magnetization plateau originates from an antiferromagnetic interaction, it is convincing that 2s of the total spin amplitude S + s contributes\nto the plateaux appearing.\nLet us turn back to Fig. 1 and observe the plateaux\nmore carefully, especially as functions of \u03b1. In the\ncases of s = 12 , the plateaux are quite tough against\nthe XY -like anisotropy. They are stable all over the\nantiferromagnetic-coupling region. These observations\nare in contrast with the classical behavior. The classical spin-(S, s) Heisenberg Hamiltonian also exhibits the\nmagnetization plateau at m = S \u2212 s, but it survives\nonly a small amount of XY -like anisotropy. For instance, the critical value for (S, s) = (1, 12 ) is estimated as\n\u03b1c = 0.943(1) [41]. The contrast between quantum spins\nand classical vectors suggests that the single plateaux\nin the quantum-spin magnetization curves may be attributed to the valence-bond excitation gap (valence-bond\ngap) rather than the N\u00e9el-state excitation gap (N\u00e9el gap).\nFrom this point of view, the \u03b1-dependences of the two\ncoexistent plateaux in the cases of s = 1 are interesting.\nThe tiny second plateaux are much more stable against\nthe XY -like anisotropy than the steady-looking initial\nsteps. Since the N\u00e9el state reaches the saturation via\na single-step excitation, the second and higher plateaux\nshould originate from the valence-bond gap. The magnitude of the gap exponentially decreases with the increase\nof m, but the quantum gap-generation mechanism itself is\nrather tough against the XY -like anisotropy. The initial\nplateaux in the multi-step magnetization curves, which\nare relatively unstable against the XY -like anisotropy,\nmay be attributed to the N\u00e9el gap. It seems that the\nlowest-lying magnetization plateaux are of quantum appearance for s = 12 but are of classical aspect for s \u2265 1.\nH (a) (1,1/2)\n4\nS\n3\n\n5\n\n+\n\nj=1\n(l)\n\n\u03b4c =\n\nA=\n\n[(2S \u2212 2s)!]2 l!(l \u2212 1)!\n\nl=1\n\n\u00d7[S(S + 1) \u2212 (S \u2212 2s + l \u2212 1)(S \u2212 2s + l)]\n\u001b1/2\n\u00d7[s(s + 1) \u2212 (s \u2212 l)(s \u2212 l + 1)]\n2s\nX\n(2S \u2212 2s + l)!\n\n(2S \u2212 2s)!l!\n\nl=0\n\n2s\nX\n(2S \u2212 2s + l)!\nl=0\n\nS\n\n/\n\nS\n\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 \u03b4 0\n\n(3.3)\n\n2s \u001a\nX\n(2S \u2212 2s + l)!(2S \u2212 2s + l \u2212 1)!\n\n(2S \u2212 2s)!l!\n\nC=\n\n(2S \u2212 2s)!l!\n\nN\n\n2s\nX\n(2S \u2212 2s + l)!\n\n(2S \u2212 2s)!l!\n\nl=0\n2s\nX\n\nDBD\n\n\u00d7\n\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 \u03b4\n\nl=0\n\n/\n\nFIG. 3.

The phase diagrams\nare exact on the line of \u03b4 = 1, where the spin-( 32 , 1) chain,\nfor example, reaches the saturation (S) via the doublebond dimer (DBD) and single-bond dimer (SBD) states.\nThe point is that the \u03b4 = 0 ground states are better approximated by the decoupled-dimer states than by the\nN\u00e9el (N) states in the cases of s = 21 , while vice versa in\nall other cases.

Thus,\nthe N\u00e9el-gap-like character of the initial plateaux in the\nmulti-step magnetization curves become more and more\nsettled as s increases, which leads to the instability of\nthe plateaux against the XY -like anisotropy. The exceptional cases of s = 12 may be recognized as the quantum\nlimit. Another simple calculation also supports this scenario. Let us consider a spin-wave description and a perturbation treatment of the antiferromagnetic excitation\ngap from the ground state. The spin-wave excitations are\nbased on the N\u00e9el-order background, whereas the perturbation from the decoupled-dimer limit assumes the\ncrackion-like excitations to appear in the valence-bond\nbackground. We compare in Table I both estimates with\nthe exact values, namely, the upper critical fields for the\ninitial plateaux. In the cases of s = 12 , the perturbation calculations are better than the spin-wave estimates,\nwhile vice versa in the cases of s \u2265 1. We are again\nconvinced that the single plateaux for s = 12 are relatively of quantum aspect, while the lowest-magnetization\nplateaux in the multi-step process for s \u2265 1 are relatively\nof classical aspect. All other plateaux, the second and\nhigher steps, should essentially be based on the quantum\nmechanism. Now here is a question: As \u03b1 increases, at\nwhich point do the quantum plateaux for m > S \u2212 s disappear? Our numerical investigations estimate that they\nsurvive the whole region of \u03b1 > 1 and disappear in the\nIsing limit.\nFinally we draw the ground-state phase diagrams on\nthe \u03b1\u03b4-plane. If the system is massive at the sector of\nmagnetization M , H\u00b1 (N, M ) are extrapolated to different thermodynamic-limit values H\u00b1 (m) with exponential\nsize corrections. On the other hand, in the critical phase,\nH\u00b1 (N, M ) converge to the same value as [47,48]\n\n1\n2\n\n(a)\n\n1.0\n\n(a) (1,1/2)\n\n(b) (3/2,1/2)\n\n\u03b4\none plateau\n(m=1)\n\none plateau\n(m=1/2)\n\n0.5\n\nno plateau\n\nno plateau\n0.0\n1.0\n\n(c) (3/2,1)\n\u03b4\n\n(d) (2,1)\n\non\n\ntwo plateaux\n(m=1/2,3/2)\n\nlat\n\nea\n\nu(\n\nm=\n\nla\n\n0.5\n\ntwo plateaux\n(m=1,2)\n\nep\n\nep\n\n2)\n\nau\n\nte\n=3\n\n(m\n\nno plateau\n\nno plateau\n\n)\n\n/2\n\n\u03c0vs \u03b7\n,\nN\n\n\u03b1\n\n1.0\n\nFIG. 5.

However, the anisotropy-induced breakdown of the plateau\nis a transition of the Kosterlitz-Thouless type and the\nfixed point could only be determined with great uncertainty [50]. Thus we here rely upon the critical exponent \u03b7 which should cross over the value 14 on the phase\nboundary. Provided vs is given, we can estimate \u03b7 using the scaling law (3.5). We obtain vs directly from the\ndispersion relation.

Therefore, we can visualize the phase transition by plotting the\nscaled gap N \u2206N (m) as a function of \u03b1 as shown in Fig.\n5. The phase boundaries could in principle be extracted\n\n(3.6)\n\nwe further verify the central charge being unity in the\ncritical region, though it is not so useful in determining\nthe phase boundary. The thus-obtained phase boundaries are shown by solid lines in Fig. 6. The single\n4\n\n\fM\u2032 = Ni (s = 1), are encouraged. The plateaux would\nmore or less be obscured in any actual measurement, but\nthey, however small, should necessarily be detected by\nsome anomaly in the magnetic susceptibility. The chemical modification of the bond alternation \u03b4 and/or the\nexchange anisotropy \u03b1 must help us to directly observe\nthe second-step plateaux, though we take main interest\nin the Heisenberg point.\n\nplateaux, with a quantum base, are stable over the whole\nantiferromagnetic-coupling region (a,b), while the initial\nplateaux in the multi-step process, taking on a classical\ncharacter, less survive the XY -like anisotropy than the\nquantum higher plateaux (c,d). The existence of the second plateaux without any bond polymerization, which is\nthe main issue in the present article, should be verified\nvery carefully. So then we further employ an idea of the\nlevel spectroscopy [51], thus called, in analyzing the second plateau. Comparing the relevant excitation energies\nwhose scaling dimensions are 2 at the critical point, we\nrecognize the level crossing of them as the phase boundary. The thus-detected transitions are also plotted by\nbroken lines in Fig. 6. The slight difference between\nthe two estimates inevitably arises from the logarithmic\ncorrections to the scaling law (3.5), where the level spectroscopy is more reliable than the naivest scaling analysis.\nAnyway, we may now fully be convinced of the existence\nof the novel multi-plateau magnetization curves.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe authors thank Dr. K.

SUMMARY AND FUTURE ASPECT\n\nThe one-dimensional Heisenberg ferrimagnet with alternating spins S and s exhibits a 2s-plateau magnetization curve even at the most symmetric point.\nIt is interesting to compare the present spin-(S, s)\nferrimagnetic chain with the spin- 12 bond-polymerized\nchain of period 2(S + s), that is, the (2S \u2212\n1)-times-ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic-(2s \u2212 1)-timesferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic chain. In the strong\nferromagnetic-coupling limit, the latter may be regarded\nas equivalent to the former. In the same meaning,\nthe spin-S antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain can be\nviewed as a spin- 21 bond-polymerized chain of period\n2S. Such replica chains generally exhibit magnetization plateaux in certain regions of the ratio of the ferromagnetic coupling JF to the antiferromagnetic one\nJA , \u03b3 \u2261 JF /JA . However, in the case of the spin1\n2 ferromagnetic-ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic chain\nwhich is the replica model of the spin- 23 antiferromagnetic\nHeisenberg chain, Okamoto [6] and Hida [7] reported that\nthe plateau vanishes at \u03b3 = 4 \u223c 5 and therefore the pure\nHeisenberg chain exhibits no plateau. Thus the plateaux\nobserved here in the most symmetric Heisenberg ferrimagnets still interest us to a great extent.\nAs we come up the steps, the plateau length exponentially decreases. It is hard to numerically observe the\nhigher-lying plateaux, still harder experimentally. Only\nthe first and second plateaux may lie within the limits of\nmeasurement. In this context, we are fortunate to have\na series of bimetallic quasi-one-dimensional complexes\nMM\u2032 (EDTA)*6H2 O (M, M\u2032 = Mn, Co, Ni, Cu) [52]. Their\nexchange coupling constants are all about 10kB [K] and\nthus the complete magnetization curves could technically be observed. Magnetization measurements on them,\nespecially with M = Mn (S = 25 ), Co (S = 32 ) and\n\n[1] M. Oshikawa, M. Yamanaka, and I. Affleck, Phys. Rev.\nLett. 78, 1984 (1997).\n[2] E. Lieb, T.
