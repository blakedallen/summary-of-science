INTRODUCTION\n\nIt has long been realized that the striking nonclassical nature of entanglement lies at the heart of the study of\nfundamental issues in quantum mechanics, as witnessed by the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paper [1], Bell's theorem [2]\nand its subsequent experimental verifications [3,4]. The recent surge of interest and progress in quantum information\ntheory allows one to take a more positive view of entanglement and regard it as an essential resource for many ingenious\napplications such as quantum teleportation [5,6] and quantum cryptography [7]. These applications rely on the ability\nto engineer and manipulate entangled states in a controlled way. So far, the generation and manipulation of entangled\nstates have been demonstrated with photon pairs produced in optical processes such as parametric downconversion\n[6,8], with ions in an ion trap [9], and with atoms in cavity QED experiments [10]. All these experiments use as\na source of entanglement two or more spatially separated particles (photons, ions or atoms) possessing correlated\nproperties.\nIn this work we consider entanglement produced with a single particle(\"single-particle entanglement\") and explore\nits usefulness. As a prototype of a single-particle entangled state, we take an output state emerging from a lossless\n50/50 beam splitter irradiated by a single photon. Here the one photon state and the vacuum state can be regarded\nto represent the logical states 1 and 0 of the qubit. Single photons have already been considered as a unit to carry\nlogical states of the qubit in a proposal to construct a quantum optical model of the Fredkin gate [11]. Recently, it\nhas been proposed that the single-photon entangled state be used to create macroscopic entangled field states [12].\nThe main propose of this work is two-fold. First, we wish to present a scheme for quantum teleportation based on\nthe single-photon entangled state. A characteristic feature of this scheme is that it requires only linear optical devices\nsuch as beam splitters and phase shifters and thus provides a way of achieving all linear optical teleportation along\nthe line suggested by Cerf et al [13]. Second, we wish to derive a single-particle version of Bell's inequality that is\napplied to an interference pattern produced by single particles. A violation of this inequality establishes the nonlocal\nnature of a system described by a single-particle entangled state.\nII. SINGLE-PARTICLE ENTANGLEMENT\n\nLet us consider a single photon incident on a lossless symmetric 50/50 beam splitter equipped with a pair of \u2212 \u03c02\nphase shifters, as depicted in Fig.1. Denoting the two input ports of the beam splitter by I and J and the output ports\nby A and B, and assuming that the photon enters the beam splitter through the input port I, the input state can be\nwritten as |1iI |0iJ , where |1i and |0i are the one photon state and the vacuum state, respectively, and the subscripts\nI and J refer to the modes of photon entering the beam splitter through the input ports I and J, respectively. The\noutput state emerging from the beam splitter is then given by\n1\n|\u03a8i = \u221a (|1iA |0iB + |0iA |1iB )\n2\n\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\nE-mail address : hwlee@laputa.kaist.ac.kr\nOn leave from Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology\n\n1\n\n(1)\n\n\fwhere subscripts A and B refer to the modes of photon exiting the beam splitter through the output ports A and B,\nrespectively. The state given by Eq. (1) represents a single-photon entangled state. We note that the output state is\nobtained in the symmetric combination as given by Eq. (1), because the phase shifter at the output port A acts to\noffset the phase difference of \u03c02 between the reflected and transmitted waves [14] (we assume throughout this work\nthat the reflected wave leads the transmitted wave by \u03c02 in phase). The phase shifter at the input port J does not\nplay any role in this case because only vacuum is present at this port.\n\nIII. QUANTUM TELEPORTATION\n\nWe are now ready to describe a teleportation scheme that makes use of single-particle entanglement. As in the\nstandard teleportation scheme [5,6], this scheme consists of three distinct parts as shown in Fig. 2; the source station\nthat generates a single-photon entangled state, Alice's station where a Bell measurement is performed and its result\nis sent away through classical communication channels, and Bob's station where the signal from Alice is read through\nclassical communication channels and a suitable unitary transformation is performed. Details of the teleportation\nprocedure described below follow closely the original proposal [5].\nThe source station consisting of the same setup as in Fig. 1 generates a single-photon entangled state in the form\nof Eq. (1). The reflected wave A of the entangled state is sent to Alice and the transmitted wave B to Bob. At Alice's\nstation this reflected wave A of the entangled state is combined via a lossless symmetric 50/50 beam splitter with a\npair of \u2212 \u03c02 phase shifters to a wave C which is in an unknown superposition of a one photon state and a vacuum state,\na|1iC + b|0iC , where |a|2 + |b|2 = 1. This state of unknown superposition is the state that Alice wishes to teleport to\nBob. The field state incident on Alice's beam splitter is |\u03a8iin = \u221a12 (|1iA |0iB + |0iA |1iB )(a|1iC + b|0iC ), which upon\nrearrangement can be written in the Bell basis as\n1 (+)\n[|\u03a8 i(a|1iB + b|0iB ) + |\u03a8(\u2212) i(a|1iB \u2212 b|0iB )\n2\n+ |\u03a6(+) i(a|0iB + b|1iB ) + |\u03a6(\u2212) i(a|0iB \u2212 b|1iB )]\n\n|\u03a8iin =\n\n(2)\n\nwhere |\u03a8(\u00b1) i and |\u03a6(\u00b1) i are the Bell states defined by\n1\n|\u03a8(\u00b1) i = \u221a (|0iA |1iC \u00b1 |1iA |0iC )\n2\n1\n(\u00b1)\n|\u03a6 i = \u221a (|1iA |1iC \u00b1 |0iA |0iC )\n2\n\n(3)\n\nA straightforward algebra based on the quantum theory of the beam splitter [14,15] yields that the output states\ncorresponding to |\u03a8(+) i, |\u03a8(\u2212) i, |\u03a6(+) i and |\u03a6(\u2212) i are given respectively by |0iE |1iF , |1iE |0iF , 12 (|0iE |2iF \u2212|2iE |0iF )+\n\u221a1 |0iE |0iF and 1 (|0iE |2iF \u2212 |2iE |0iF ) \u2212 \u221a1 |0iE |0iF , where subscripts E and F refer to the modes of photon exiting\n2\n2\n2\nthe beam splitter via the output ports E and F , respectively. Thus, a detection of a single photon by the detector\nDF combined with a detection of no photon by the detector DE would indicate that the input state is |\u03a8(+) i and\nthat, according to Eq. (2), the state at Bob's station is a|1iB + b|0iB , exactly the state that Alice wants to teleport\nto Bob. In this case, Bob needs do nothing and teleportation is successfully achieved. A detection of a single photon\nby the detector DE and a detection of no photon by the detector DF would mean that the input state is |\u03a8(\u2212) i.\nThe corresponding state at Bob's station is a|1iB \u2212 b|0iB . If Bob is informed of such a Bell measurement result\nfrom Alice through classical communication channels, he needs to apply a \u03c0 phase shifter which changes the sign of\nthe state |1iB , and teleportation is then successfully achieved. The teleportation, however, fails, either if one of the\ndetectors registers two photons and the other none, which would mean that the input state is |1iA |1iC , or if neither\ndetector registers any photon, which would mean that the input state is |0iA |0iC . The probability of success for\nour teleportation scheme is thus 50%, which is the same as the probability of success for the standard teleportation\nmethod. It has been noted [16] that a reliable (100% probability of success) teleportation cannot be achieved by\nlinear operations due to the absence of photon-photon interactions. It should be noted that the 50% probability of\nsuccess for our scheme is obtained only if the Bell states |\u03a8(+) i and |\u03a8(\u2212) i are clearly distinguished not only from each\nother but also from the states |1iA |1iC and |0iA |0iC (or from the Bell states |\u03a6(+) i and |\u03a6(\u2212) i). This means that our\ndetectors should be capable of distinguishing a single photon from two. This is of course not an easy requirement to be\nmet. It seems, however, that single photon counting in the optical regime and, in particular, in the high-energy(x-ray,\n\u03b3-ray) regime lies within the reach of the present technology. Our analysis also assumes that the detectors are of unit\nquantum efficiency.\n2\n\n\fThe state, a|1iC + b|0iC , to be teleported in our teleportation scheme can be generated using the methods proposed\nin the past [17,18]. One may also generate the state to be teleported using a beam splitter, as indicated in the leftmost\npart of Fig. 2. The field state emerging from the beam splitter of complex reflection and transmission coefficients r\nand t can be written as t|1iC |0iD + r|0iC |1iD , where the subscripts C and D refer to the modes of the transmitted\nand reflected waves, respectively. The transmitted wave C is then directed toward Alice's station for teleportation.\nAlice therefore has two entangled waves in the state |\u03a8iin = \u221a12 (|1iA |0iB + |0iA |1iB )(t|1iC |0iD + r|0iC |1iD ) to be\ncombined in the beam splitter. She of course has a control over only the waves A and C. The state |\u03a8iin can be\nrewritten in the Bell basis as\n1 (+)\n[|\u03a8 i(t|1iB |0iD + r|0iB |1iD ) + |\u03a8(\u2212) i(t|1iB |0iD \u2212 r|0iB |1iD )\n2\n+ |\u03a6(+) i(t|0iB |0iD + r|1iB |1iD ) + |\u03a6(\u2212) i(t|0iB |0iD \u2212 r|1iB |1iD )]\n\n|\u03a8iin =\n\n(4)\n\nIf Alice's Bell measurement yields the state |\u03a8(+) i, Bob has a wave B in the entangled state t|1iB |0iD + r|0iB |1iD .\nThe teleportation is thus successfully achieved. If Alice's Bell measurement yields the state |\u03a8(\u2212) i, Bob needs to\napply a \u03c0 phase shifter, which changes the relative phase of the state |1iB |0iD with respect to the state |0iB |1iD by \u03c0.\nWe therefore see that our scheme offers a simple way of teleporting an entangled state. That teleportation works also\nfor entangled states was already pointed out by Bennett et al. [5] in their original proposal for quantum teleportation.\nIt is easy to confirm that teleportation has indeed been successfully achieved. As shown in the rightmost part of\nFig. 2, we combine the wave D with the teleported wave B using a beam splitter that has the same transmission and\nreflection coefficients as the beam splitter that created the teleported entangled state t|1iC |0iD + r|0iC |1iD . If the\nteleportation is successful, then the input state to the beam splitter must be t|1iB |0iD +r|0iB |1iD . The situation then\nis exactly the reverse of the situation that created the teleported entangled state. Thus, a successful teleportation\ncan be verified by confirming that the detector DG detects a single photon and the detector DH detects none.\nFinally we mention that the teleportation scheme described here uses essentially the same setup as the scheme\nproposed by Pegg et al. [17] to perform optical state truncation. The similarity of the teleportation process and the\ntruncation process has already been noted by Pegg et al. Whereas the input state to be truncated is a superposition of\nmany number states including one photon state and vacuum, and a successful truncation at one photon state requires\nwaiting until the two detectors register a total of one photon, the input state to be teleported is a superposition of\none photon state and vacuum, and teleportation is successful half of the times when the two detectors (DE and DF\nof Fig. 2 )register a total of one photon.\nIV. BELL'S INEQUALITY\n\nIt was shown in the previous section that single-particle entanglement can be as useful as two-particle entanglement,\nas far as application to quantum teleportation is concerned. Considering that two-particle entanglement provides an\nopportunity to test fundamental principles of quantum mechanics related to EPR paradox and Bell's theorem, one may\nwonder whether single-particle entanglement can offer a similar opportunity. Although up to now Bell's inequality tests\nhave been performed with entangled photon pairs [3,4], a proposal for an experiment that demonstrates nonlocality\nand a violation of Bell's inequality with a single photon was made 10 years ago [19]. The proposal stimulated much\ninterest and, at the same time, intensive debate [20]. There is no question that the proposed experiment demonstrates\nnonlocality of the system and a violation of Bell's inequality. It, however, does not seem entirely clear at least to some\nof the researchers that the outcome of the experiment can be attributed solely to an effect associated with a single\nphoton, because the experiment requires performing a particle-particle correlation measurement.\nHere, for our discussion of nonlocality with a single-particle entangled state, we concentrate on the type of correlation\nmeasurement that can certainly be attributed to a single photon effect, i.e., a correlation measurement of the first-order\ntype in Glauber's sense [21]. In fact, the nonlocal behavior demonstrated in the first-order interference measurement\nof Grangier et al. [22] with a Mach-Zehnder interferometer is undoubtedly a single-photon effect. We elaborate further\non this experiment and show that Bell's inequality, which is violated by the experimental observation of Grangier et\nal., can be derived based on the locality assumption. Our argument below can be considered as a derivation of a\nsingle-particle version of Bell's inequality [2,23]. We recall that it was proven [24] that any pure entangled state of\ntwo or more particles violate Bell's inequality. Our derivation allows one to extend the proof to an entangled state\nof a single particle. It should be noted, however, that the interference pattern observed by Grangier et al. can be\nexplained by a nonlocal classical wave theory as well as by the quantum theory. A violation of the single-particle\nversion of Bell's inequality therefore does not establish the quantum theory as the only correct theory. Its significance\nlies in the fact that it gives a quantitative confirmation that a system described by a single-particle entangled state\nbehaves nonlocally.\n3\n\n\fConsider a Mach-Zehnder interferometer consisting of a pair of lossless symmetric 50/50 beam splitters, each with\na pair of \u2212 \u03c02 phase shifters, and a pair of perfect mirrors, as shown in Fig. 3. A single photon and vacuum are\nincident on the first beam splitter from the input ports I and J, respectively. The output state is again given by\n\u221a1 (|1iA |0iB + |0iA |1iB ). The reflected wave A and the transmitted wave B are recombined at the second beam\n2\nsplitter. Alice and Bob, located somewhere along the pathway of the reflected wave A and the transmitted wave B,\nrespectively, are each equipped with a phase shifter. If neither Alice nor Bob applies a phase shifter, the field state\nemerging from the second beam splitter is |1iC |0iD and it is certain that the photon strikes the detector DC . Thus,\nwhen N photons are sent from the input port I in succession, all N photons arrive at the detector DC and none at\nthe detector DD . Suppose now Alice inserts her phase shifter into the beam A and changes its phase by \u03c6A . A\nstraightforward calculation based on the quantum theory of the beam splitter [14,15] yields that the output state\nemerging from the second beam splitter is (apart from an overall phase factor) cos \u03c62A |1iC |0iD + i sin \u03c62A |0iC |1iD .\nThus NA \u2261 (sin2 \u03c62A )N photons out of the total N incident photons change their paths and strike the detector DD\nas a consequence of Alice's action to change the phase of the beam A by \u03c6A . If Bob, not Alice, inserts his phase\nshifter into the beam B and changes its phase by \u2212\u03c6B , the output state becomes cos \u03c62B |1iC |0iD + i sin \u03c62B |0iC |1iD .\nThus NB \u2261 (sin2 \u03c62B )N photons out of the total N incident photons change their paths and strike the detector DD\nas a consequence of Bob's action. What would happen if both Alice and Bob use their phase shifters and change the\nphases of the beams A and B by \u03c6A and \u2212\u03c6B , respectively? A straightforward quantum calculation yields that the\nB\nB\nB\noutput state in this case is cos \u03c6A +\u03c6\n|1iC |0iD + i sin \u03c6A +\u03c6\n|0iC |1iD , i.e. NAB \u2261 (sin2 \u03c6A +\u03c6\n)N photons out of the\n2\n2\n2\nN incident photons change their paths and strike the detector DD .\nOn the other hand an argument based on the locality assumption leads to a result contradictory to the above\nquantum result. In order to show this, we assume that those photons that do not change their paths and still arrive\nat DC , both when Alice, not Bob, uses her phase shifter, and when Bob, not Alice, uses his phase shifter, will still not\nchange their paths and still arrive at DC when both Alice and Bob use their phase shifters. This assumption means that\nwe do not allow for any cooperative effect between Alice's phase shifter and Bob's and therefore assures independence\nfrom each other [25]. It may therefore be considered as a single-particle version of the locality assumption. Let the\ngroups GN , GA , GB , GAB contain, respectively, the total N photons, NA photons that strike the detector DD when\nAlice, not Bob, uses her phase shifter, NB photons that strike the detector DD when Bob, not Alice, uses his phase\nshifter, and NAB photons that strike the detector DD when both Alice and Bob use their phase shifters. The locality\nassumption dictates that the group (GN \u2212 GA ) \u2229 (GN \u2212 GB ) is a subset of the group (GN \u2212 GAB ). Since the number\nof photons that belong to the group (GN \u2212 GA ) \u2229 (GN \u2212 GB ) is greater than or equal to N \u2212 NA \u2212 NB , it immediately\nfollows that N \u2212 NAB \u2265 N \u2212 NA \u2212 NB . We therefore arrive at the inequality NAB \u2264 NA + NB . This inequality is in\nB\n\u2264 sin2 \u03c62A + sin2 \u03c62B , is clearly violated for\ndisagreement with the quantum theory, because the inequality, sin2 \u03c6A +\u03c6\n2\n2 \u03c6A\n2 \u03c6B\n2 \u03c6A +\u03c6B\n\u2264 sin 2 + sin 2 , is completely equivalent to the formula,\nsome values of \u03c6A and \u03c6B . The inequality, sin\n2\n~\n~\n1 + P (b, ~c) \u2265 |P (~a, b) \u2212 P (~a, ~c)|, derived originally by Bell [2] for a correlated spin pair, if we take the spin correlation\nfunction P (~a, ~c) = \u2212 cos \u03c6A , P (~b, ~c) = \u2212 cos \u03c6B , and P (~a, ~b) = \u2212 cos(\u03c6A + \u03c6B ).\nV. CONCLUSION\n\nIn conclusion we have investigated a possibility of utilizing single-particle entanglement and shown that singleparticle entanglement can be used as a useful resource for fundamental studies in quantum mechanics and for applications in quantum teleportation. An experimental scheme that utilizes single-particle entanglement generally requires\nproduction, maintenance and detection of photons at a single photon level. With the development of photon counting\ntechniques and of reliable single photon sources [26], however, the experimental realization of the schemes seems\nwithin the reach of the present technology.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\n\nThis research was supported by the Brain Korea 21 Project of the Korean Ministry of Education and by the Korea\nAtomic Energy Research Institute(KAERI).

At the source station a single\nphoton entangled state is generated by a beam splitter. The transmitted wave B is sent to Bob, while the reflected\nwave A is sent to Alice who combines it with the wave C to be teleported. Alice makes a Bell measurement upon\nthe combined waves A and C and informs the result to Bob via a classical communication channel (represented by a\nwavy line). When Bob is informed of Alice's measurement result, he performs a suitable unitary transformation\nwith a \u03c0 phase shifter. The station to the right of Bob equipped with a beam splitter and detectors DG and DH\nperforms a verification of a successful operation of teleportation if necessary.\nFig. 3.
