With the current observational\ntechniques, the required precision to distinguish between different models (errors < 2-3 %) can only be achieved using detached eclipsing binaries where 1)\nboth stars are similar in mass, i.e. q = M1/M2 \u223c 1.0, and 2) each star is a main\nsequence object below 1M\u2299.\nUntil 2003 only three such binaries had been found and analyzed in detail.\nTwo new systems were published in 2005 (Creevey et al.; L\u00f3pez-Morales &\nRibas), almost doubling the previous number of data points. Here we present\npreliminary results for 3 new low-mass detached eclipsing binaries. These are\nthe first studied systems from our sample of 41 new binaries (Shaw & L\u00f3pezMorales, this proceedings). We also provide an updated comparison between\nthe Mass\u2013Radius and the Mass\u2013Tef f relations predicted by the models and the\nobservational data from detached eclipsing binaries.\n\nWe define low-mass stars as main sequence stars with masses between 1M\u2299\nand the Hydrogen burning limit (0.07\u20130.08M\u2299 ). Low-mass stars are small cool\nobjects, with radii between 1.0 and 0.1R\u2299 and effective surface temperatures\nbetween 6000 and 2500 K. They are also faint as their luminosities between 1 and\n10\u22124 L\u2299 reveal. They are the most abundant stars in the Galaxy, where least 7\nof every 10 stars are low-mass main sequence stars. These objects play a role on\nstudies of baryonic dark matter (it is thought that low-mass stars, brown dwarfs,\nand stellar remnants are the main contributors to the baryonic dark matter in\nthe Universe), on dynamical studies of galaxies and star clusters, and on the\ndetailed characterization of the stars in the solar neighborhood, where intensive\nsearches for Earth-like planets around low-mass stars are currently underway.\nLow-mass stars are also a subject of interest in other fields in physics, given\nthe complicated physical processes that are taking place in these stars. H2\nmolecules, TiO, H2 O, CO, and CN become stable in the atmosphere of low-mass\nstars at temperatures below 5000\u20134000 K. Below 2800 K, even more complex\nmolecular compounds, such as CaT iO3 , Al2 O3 , and M g2 SiO4 , also become stable. Therefore any model trying to reproduce how the radiation is transmitted\nfrom the interior of the stars through their atmospheres needs to take into account the effect of all these molecules and compounds. The interior physics of\n1\n\n\f2\nlow-mass stars is also challenging. The interior of these stars is essentially a\nplasma of ionized H and He under partially or fully degenerate conditions, so\none cannot model them using ideal equations of state (EOSs). Instead, we need\nmore elaborate EOSs, that include coulomb interactions between electrons and\nions, ionization pressure effects, the effect of the electric fields generated by the\nions, and so on.\n\n1.\n\nModels vs. Observations\n\nSeveral groups have worked for the past two decades on the generation of reliable\nmodels of low-mass stars, but it wasn't until the late 1990s that they arrived\nto realistic models of these objects. The models of the group led by Baraffe &\nChabrier are at present the most widely used ones, since they can reproduce\nvery well many of the observational properties of low-mass stars. For example,\nthe Mass-Magnitude and the Mass-Luminosity relations of these stars are very\nnicely reproduced by the Baraffe et al. (1998) models. Those models, however,\nstill have some problems reproducing the effective temperature scale and the\nMass-Radius relation of these stars.\nIn the case of the Tef f scale, Baraffe et al. (1998) find that at temperatures\nbelow \u223c 3700K the models predict bluer V\u2013I colors than the ones observed. A\npossible reason provided by the authors for this mismatch is a missing source\nof opacity in the optical that causes the stars to be fainter in V than what the\nmodels predict.\nFor the Mass\u2013Radius relation, the models underestimate the radii of the\nstars by at least 10 %. This conclusion is based on the observational results\nfrom eclipsing binaries with errorbars of 3 % or less (see figure 1)1 . The problem may be that the \"standard models\" do not include the effect of magnetic\nfields. Mullan & MacDonald (2001) find that low-mass star models have larger\nradii and smaller Tef f when magnetic fields are taken into account. Magnetic\nfields are generally enhanced by stellar rotation, and in close binaries (where\nwe are measuring systematically larger radii) the stars are spun up by orbital\nsynchronization.\n\n2.\n\nLow-Mass Eclipsing Binaries\n\nWith the current observational techniques, double-lined detached eclipsing binaries are the only objects where we can measure simultaneously the mass and the\nradius of stars with error bars of less than 2\u20133 %. The technique is a well established one: the radial velocity (RV) curves of the binaries provide the masses as\na function of the orbital inclination of the system. From their light curves (LCs)\none can then measure the orbital inclination of the system and the radius of\n\n1\n\nS\u00e9gransan et al. (2003) have also measured the radius of several low-mass single stars using\ninterferometry. These radii, with error bars 5 % or larger, show a large scatter in the M\u2013R\ndiagram. For clarity, we have not included those values in figure 1, but we include them in our\ndiscussion in \u00a7 6.\n\n\f3\neach star. Also, by measuring the LCs at different wavelengths one can estimate\nthe effective temperature of the stars.\nWe have searched to date five photometry databases (see companion paper\nin this proceedings by Shaw & L\u00f3pez-Morales). The result of that search are\n41 new detached eclipsing binaries with masses below 1M\u2299 . After identifying\nthe binaries from the LCs in those databases, we need to conduct follow-up\nobservational campaigns to measure the optical and infrared light curves of\nthe systems and their radial velocity curves. This is an extensive project that\nrequires of large amounts of telescope time. Currently we have been awarded\ntime in the facilities listed in Table 1. Our final goal is to obtain full, high\nquality LCs and RV curves to be able to determine the masses and the radii of\nthe stars in those binaries with errors smaller than 3%.\n3.\n\nThree New Binaries: GU Boo, RXJ0239, and NSVS01031772\n\nWe have completed to date the optical (VRI) light curves and radial velocity\ncurves of three binaries: GU Boo (L\u00f3pez-Morales & Ribas 2005), RXJ0239.1\n(Torres et al., in prep), and NSVS01031772 (hereafter NSVS0103; L\u00f3pez-Morales\net al., submitted). Near-IR light curves are also available for RXJ0239.1. Table\n2 summarizes the masses, radii, and temperatures derived for the components of\neach binary2 . The two stars in GU Boo are almost identical to the stars in YY\nGem. The stars in the other two binaries, with masses between 0.5 and 0.55 M\u2299\nand 0.7 and 0.73 M\u2299 respectively, fill-in two current gaps in the Mass-Radius\nrelation.\n4.\n\nComparison with the Models\n\nFigure 1 shows the Mass-Radius relation of stars below 1M\u2299 . The lines represent\nthe predictions of different models, using 0.35 Gyr isochrones and a metallicity\nZ = 0.02. The open circles correspond to the previously known binaries CM Dra\n(Lacy 1977; Metcalfe et al. 1996), CU Cnc (Delfosse et al. 1999; Ribas 2003),\nTrES-Her0-07621 (Creevey et al. 2005), and YY Gem (Leung & Schneider 1978;\nTorres & Ribas 2002). The filled squares show the location in this diagram\nof the components of GU Boo, RXJ0239.1, and NSVS0103. Except for TrESHer0-07621, all the other stars show a clear trend towards larger radii than\nwhat the models predict. All the stars in binaries are at least 10% larger than\nwhat any of the models predict. Figure 2 shows the Mass\u2013log(Tef f ) relation\nfor GU Boo, RXJ0239.1, and NSVS0103 (open circles), YY Gem (filled circle),\nand CU Cnc (open triangles). The top figure corresponds to a metallicity of\nZ=0.01, the bottom figure is for a metallicity of Z=0.02. The age of both sets\nof isochrones is 0.35 Gyrs. The bottom figure (Z=0.02) agrees with the trend\nobserved by Baraffe et al. (1998), where they find that below 3700\u20133800K the\neffective temperatures predicted by the models are larger than the ones observed\nin low-mass stars.\n2\n\nThe parameters of NSVS01031772 are preliminary. More accurate values will be published on\nL\u00f3pez-Morales et al. (2006, in prep.)\n\n\f4\n5.\n\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nWe present in this paper the first results of an extensive observing campaign\nprimarily aimed at providing an accurate empirical M-R relation for low-mass\nstars. Our targets are low-mass eclipsing binaries, from where precise stellar\nmasses and radii can be derived. These systems also provide an estimation of\nthe Tef f of the stars.\nOur current sample contains 41 new binaries with masses between 0.35 and\n1.0M\u2299 . Here we present the parameters of the first three of those binaries, GU\nBoo, RXJ0239.1, and NSVS0103, which provide six new valuable data points.\nThe addition of those new data points to the Mass\u2013Radius relation diagram\n(see figure 1) strengthens the trend already suggested by the other binaries (CM\nDra, CU Cnc, and YY Gem). That is, the models underestimate the radii of\nlow-mass stars by at least 10 %. This is at least the case for the components\nof binaries. The few available measurements from single stars present a much\nlarger scatter and larger error bars, preventing the identification of a clear trend,\nif any in fact exists. A mismatch is also apparent when the Tef f of the binaries\nare compared to the predictions by the models (see figure 2). In this case the\ntemperatures are lower than the prediction by the models below \u223c 3700\u20133800K,\nas already noticed by Baraffe et al. (1998).\nObservations begin to reveal what appear to be two different populations\nof low-mass stars: non-active stars, whose parameters would be succesfully reproduced by the \"standard models\" (i.e. those not including magnetic fields),\nand active stars, where the magnetic fields play an important role.\n\nAcknowledgments.
