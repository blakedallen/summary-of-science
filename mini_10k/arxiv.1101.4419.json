WOLF\n\nAbstract. We extend the Paley\u2013Wiener theorem for riemannian symmetric spaces to an important\nclass of infinite dimensional symmetric spaces. For this we define a notion of propagation of symmetric\nspaces and examine the direct (injective) limit symmetric spaces defined by propagation. This relies\non some of our earlier work on invariant differential operators and the action of Weyl group invariant\npolynomials under restriction.\n\nIntroduction\nWe start with the notion of prolongation for symmetric spaces. In essence, a symmetric space Mk is\na prolongation of another, say Mn , when Mn sits in Mk in the simplest possible way. For example, if\nMl = SU (l + 1), compact group manifold, then Mn sits in Mk as an upper left hand corner.\nSuppose that Mk is a prolongation Mn where both are of compact type or both of noncompact type.\nWe prove surjectivity for restriction of Weyl group invariant holomorphic functions of exponential growth\nr. We discuss the conditions on r in a moment. This gives a corresponding restriction result on the\nFourier transform spaces and then a sujective map Cr\u221e (Mk ) \u2192 Cr\u221e (Mn ). Using results on conjugate\nand cut locus of compact symmetric spaces we show that the radius of injectivity for compact symmetric\nspaces forming a direct system, related by prolongation, is constant. If R is that radius then the condition\non the exponential growth size r is a function of R, thus constant for the direct system. This, together\nwith the results of [17], allows us to carry the finite dimensional Paley\u2013Wiener theorem to the limit. See\nTheorems 3.5, 4.6 and 7.12 below.\nThe classical Paley\u2013Wiener Theorem describes the growth of the Fourier transform of a function\nf \u2208 Cc\u221e (Rn ) in terms of the size of its support. Helgason and Gangolli generalized it to riemannian\nsymmetric spaces of noncompact type, Arthur extended it to semisimple Lie groups, van den Ban and\nSchlichtkrull made the extension to pseudo-riemannian reductive symmetric spaces, and finally \u00d3lafsson\nand Schlichtkrull worked out the corresponding result for compact riemannian symmetric spaces. Here\nwe extend these results to a class of infinite dimensional riemannian symmetric spaces, the classical direct\nlimits compact symmetric spaces. The main idea is to combine the results of \u00d3lafsson and Schlichtkrull\nwith Wolf's results on direct limits lim Mn of riemannian symmetric spaces and limits of the corresponding\n\u2212\u2192\nfunction spaces on the Mn .\nOf course compact support in the Paley\u2013Wiener Theorem is irrelevant for functions on a compact\nsymmetric space. There one concentrates on the radius of the support. The Fourier transform space is\ninterpreted as the parameter space for spherical functions. It is linear dual space of the complex span\nof the restricted roots. When we pass to direct limits it is crucial that these ingredients be properly\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 43A85, 53C35, 22E46.\nKey words and phrases.

In order to do this we introduce the notion of propagation for pairs of root systems, pairs of\ngroups, and pairs of symmetric spaces.\nIn Section 1 we recall some basic facts concerning Paley\u2013Wiener theorems on Euclidean spaces and\ntheir behavior under the action of finite symmetry groups. In this setting we give surjectivity criteria for\nrestriction of Paley\u2013Wiener spaces.\nIn Section 2 we discuss the structural results, both for symmetric spaces of compact type and of\nnoncompact type, that we will need later. In order to do this we recall our notion of propagation from\n[17] and examine the corresponding Weyl group invariants explicitly for each type of root system. The key\nthere is the main result of [17], which summarizes the facts on restriction of Weyl groups for propagation\nof symmetric spaces.\nIn Section 3 we apply our results on Weyl group invariants to Fourier analysis on riemannian symmetric\nspaces of noncompact type. The main result is Theorem 3.7, the Paley\u2013Wiener Theorem for classical\ndirect limits of those spaces. As indicated earlier, a Z2 extension of the Weyl group is needed in case\nof root systems of type D. The extension can be realized by an automorphism \u03c3 of the of the Dynkin\ndiagram. We show that there exists an automorphism \u03c3\ne of G or a double cover such that de\n\u03c3 |a = \u03c3 and\nthe spherical function with spectral parameter \u03bb satisfies \u03c6\u03bb (e\n\u03c3 (x)) = \u03c6\u03c3\u2032 (\u03bb) (x).\nIn Section 4 we set up the basic surjectivity of the direct limit Paley\u2013Wiener Theorem for the classical\nsequences {SU (n)}, {SO(2n)}, {SO(2n+ 1)} and {Sp(2n)}. The key tool\n\u221a is Theorem 4.1, the calculation\nof the injectivity radius. That radius turns out to be a simple constant ( 2 \u03c0 or 2\u03c0) for each of the series.\nThe main result is Theorem 4.7, which sets up the projective systems of functions used in the Paley\u2013\nWiener Theorem for SU (\u221e), SO(\u221e) and Sp(\u221e). All this is needed when we go to limits of symmetric\nspaces.\nIn Section 5 we examine limits of spherical representations of compact symmetric spaces. Theorem\n5.10 is the main result. It sets up the sequence of function spaces corresponding to a direct system\n{Mn } of compact riemannian symmetric spaces in which Mk propagates Mn for k \u2267 n. We use this in\nSection 6 to show that a certain surjective map Q :R C \u221e (G)G \u2192 C \u221e (G/K)K is in fact surjective as a\nmap Cr\u221e (G)G \u2192 Cr\u221e (G/K)K . Here Q(f )(xK) := K f (xk) dk and the subscript r denotes the size of\nthe support.\nThen in Section 6, we relate the spherical Fourier transforms for the sequence {Mn }, show how\nthe injectivity radii remain constant on the sequence. We then prove the Paley\u2013Wiener Theorem 6.7\nfor compact symmetric spaces in a form that is applicable to direct limits M\u221e = lim Mn of compact\n\u2212\u2192\nriemannian symmetric spaces in which Mk propagates Mn for k \u2267 n. Along the way we obtain a stronger\nform, Theorem 6.9, of one of the key ingredients in the proof of the surjectivity.\nFinally in Section 7 we introduce and discuss a K\u2013invariant domain in M that behaves well under\npropagation. This leads to a corresponding restriction theorem, Theorem 7.12, and another result of\nPaley\u2013Wiener type, Theorem 7.15.\nOur discussion of direct limit Paley\u2013Wiener Theorems involves function space maps that have a somewhat indirect relation [23] to the L2 theory of [22]. This is discussed in Section 8, where we compare our\nmaps with the partial isometries of [22].\n\n1. Polynomial Invariants and Restriction of Paley-Wiener spaces\nIn this section we recall and refine some results of Cowling and Rais that will be used later in this article.\n\n\fTHE PALEY-WIENER THEOREM AND LIMITS OF SYMMETRIC SPACES\n\n3\n\nLet E \u223c\n= Rn be a finite dimensional Euclidean space. Let hx, yiE = hx, yi = x * y denote the inner\nproduct on E and its C\u2013bilinear extension to the complexification EC \u223c\n= Cn . Let | * | denote the\ncorresponding norm on E and EC . Note that h * , * i defines an bilinear form and a norm on E \u2217 and EC\u2217 .\nDenote by Cr\u221e (E) the space of smooth functions on E with support in a closed ball Br (0) of radius\nr > 0. Write PWr (EC\u2217 ) for the space of holomorphic function on EC\u2217 with the property that for each\nn \u2208 Z+ there exists a constant Cn > 0 such that\n(1.1)\n\n\u03bdn (F ) := sup (1 + |\u03bb|2 )n e\u2212r| Im \u03bb| |F (\u03bb)| < \u221e .\n\u03bb\u2208EC\n\nConsider a G-module V . The action on functions is given as usual by Lw f (v) := f (w\u22121 v) and we\ndenote the fixed point set by\n(1.2)\n\nV G = {v \u2208 V | g * v = v for all g \u2208 G} .\n\nIn particular, given a closed subgroup G \u2282 O(E), the spaces PWr (EC\u2217 )G and Cr\u221e (E)G are well defined.\nWe normalize the Fourier transform on E as\nZ\n(1.3)\nFE (f )(\u03bb) = fb(\u03bb) = (2\u03c0)\u2212n/2\nf (x)e\u2212i\u03bb(x) dx , \u03bb \u2208 EC\u2217 and n = dim E.\nThe Paley\u2013Wiener Theorem says that FE :\n\nE\n\u221e\nCr (E)G\n\n\u2192 PWr (EC\u2217 )G is an isomorphism.\n\nFrom now on we assume that F is another Euclidean space and that E j F . We always assume that\nthe inner products on E and F are chosen so that hx, yiE = hx, yiF for all x, y \u2208 E. Furthermore, if\nW (E) and W (F ) are closed subgroups of the respective orthogonal groups acting on E and F , then set\nWE (F ) = {w \u2208 W (F ) | w(E) = E} .\n\nWe always assume that W (E) and W (F ) are generated by reflections s\u03b1 : v 7\u2192 v \u2212 2\u03b1(v)\nh\u03b1,\u03b1i h\u03b1 , for \u03b1 in a root\nsystem in E \u2217 (respectively F \u2217 ). However the Cowling result below holds for arbitrary closed subgroup\nof O(E) (respectively O(F )).\nTheorem 1.4 (Cowling). The restriction map PWr (FC\u2217 )WE (F ) \u2192 PWr (EC\u2217 )WE (F )|EC , given by F 7\u2192\nF |EC\u2217 , is surjective.\nDenote by S(E) the symmetric algebra of E. It can be identified with the algebra of polynomial\nfunctions on E \u2217 . We use similar notation for F \u2217 .\nTheorem 1.5 (Rais). Let P1 , . . . , Pn be a basis for S(F ) over S(F )W (F ) . If F \u2208 PWr (FC\u2217 ) there exist\n\u03a61 , . . . , \u03a6n \u2208 PWr (FC\u2217 )W (F ) such that\nF = P1 \u03a61 + . . . + Pn \u03a6n .\n\nIf WE (F )|E = W (E) then Cowling's Theorem implies that the restriction map\nPWr (FC\u2217 )WE (F ) \u2192 PWr (EC\u2217 )W (E) ,\n\nF 7\u2192 F |EC\u2217 ,\n\nis surjective, but in general PWr (FC\u2217 )W (F ) is smaller than PWr (FC\u2217 )WE (F ) , so one would in general not\nexpect the restriction map to remain surjective. The following theorem gives a sufficient condition for\nthat to happen.\nTheorem 1.6. Let the notation be as above. Assume that WE (F )|E = W (E) and that the restriction\nmap S(F )W (F ) \u2192 S(E)W (E) is surjective. Then the restriction map\nis surjective.\n\nPWr (FC\u2217 )W (F ) \u2192 PWr (EC\u2217 )W (E) , given by F 7\u2192 F |EC\u2217 ,\n\n\f4\n\nGESTUR \u00d3LAFSSON AND JOSEPH A. WOLF\n\nProof. It is clear that if F \u2208 PWr (FC\u2217 )W (F ) then F |EC\u2217 \u2208 PWr (EC\u2217 )W (E) . For the surjectivity let G \u2208\nPWr (EC\u2217 )W (E) . By Theorem 1.4 and our assumption on the reflection groups there exists a function\ne \u2208 PWr (F \u2217 )WE (F ) such that G|\ne E \u2217 = G. By Theorem 1.5, there exist \u03a61 , . . . , \u03a6n \u2208 PWr (F \u2217 )W (F ) and\nG\nC\nC\nC\ne = P1 \u03a61 + . . . + Pn \u03a6n and G = G|\ne E \u2217 = (P1 |E \u2217 )(\u03a61 |E \u2217 ) + . . . +\npolynomials P1 , . . . , Pn \u2208 S(F ) such that G\nC\nC\nC\n(Pn |EC\u2217 )(\u03a6n |EC\u2217 ). As W (E) = WE (F )|E , G is W (E)\u2013invariant and the functions \u03a6j are W (F )\u2013invariant,\nwe can average the polynomials Pj over WE (F ) and thus assume that Pj |EC\u2217 \u2208 S(E)W (E) . But then there\nexists Qj \u2208 S(F )W (F ) such that Qj |EC\u2217 = Pj |EC\u2217 . Let \u03a6 := Q1 \u03a61 + . . . + Qr \u03a6r . Then \u03a6 \u2208 PWr (FC\u2217 )W (F )\n\u0003\nand \u03a6|EC\u2217 = G. Hence the restriction map is surjective.\nLet n = dim E and m = dim F . Denote by FE respectively FF the Euclidean Fourier transforms on\nE and F . The following map C was denoted by P in [3].\nCorollary 1.7 (Cowling). Let the assumptions be as above. Then the map\nZ\n\u221e\nW (F )\n\u221e\nW (E)\nC : Cr (F )\n\u2192 Cr (E)\n, given by Cf (x) =\nf (x, y) dy,\nE\u22a5\n\nis surjective.\nProof. Let c = (2\u03c0)(n\u2212m)/2 . For g \u2208 Cr\u221e (E)W (E) let G = FE (g) \u2208 PWr (EC\u2217 )W (E) . Choice F \u2208\nPWr (FC\u2217 )W (F ) such that F |EC\u2217 = c\u22121 G. With f := FF\u22121 (G|F ) \u2208 Cr\u221e (F )W (E) a simple calculation shows\nthat C(f ) = g.\n\u0003\nTheorem 1.8.

Symmetric Spaces\nIn this section we apply the results of Section 1 to harmonic analysis on symmetric spaces of noncompact\ntype. We start with some general considerations that are valid for symmetric spaces both of compact\nand noncompact type.\nLet M = G/K be a riemannian symmetric space of compact or noncompact type. Thus G is a\nconnected semisimple Lie group with an involution \u03b8 such that\n(G\u03b8 )o j K j G\u03b8\nwhere G\u03b8 = {x \u2208 G | \u03b8(x) = x} and the subscript o denotes the connected component containing the\nidentity element. If G is simply connected then G\u03b8 is connected and K = G\u03b8 . If G is without compact\nfactors and with finite center, then K \u2282 G is a maximal compact subgroup of G, K is connected, and\nG/K is simply connected.\nDenote the Lie algebra of G by g. Then \u03b8 defines an involution \u03b8 : g \u2192 g and g = k \u2295 s where\nk = {X \u2208 g | \u03b8(X) = X} is the Lie algebra of K and s = {X \u2208 g | \u03b8(X) = \u2212X}.\nCartan Duality is a bijection between the classes of simply connected symmetric spaces of noncompact\ntype and of compact type. On the Lie algebra level this isomorphism is given by g = k \u2295 s \u2194 k \u2295 is = gd .\nWe denote this bijection by M \u2194 M d .\nFix a maximal abelian subset a \u2282 s. For \u03b1 \u2208 a\u2217C let\n\ngC,\u03b1 = {X \u2208 gC | [H, X] = \u03b1(H)X for all H \u2208 aC } .\nIf gC,\u03b1 6= {0} then \u03b1 is called a (restricted) root. Denote by \u03a3(g, a) the set of roots. If M is of noncompact\ntype, then \u03a3(g, a) \u2282 a\u2217 and gC,\u03b1 = g\u03b1 + ig\u03b1 , where g\u03b1 = gC,\u03b1 \u2229 g. If M is of compact type, then the\nroots are purely imaginary on a, \u03a3(g, a) \u2282 ia\u2217 , and gC,\u03b1 \u2229 g = {0}. The set of roots is preserved under\nduality, \u03a3(g, a) = \u03a3(gd , ia), where we view those roots as C\u2013linear functionals on aC .\nIf \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a3(g, a) it can happen that 12 \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a3(g, a) or 2\u03b1 \u2208 \u03a3(g, a) (but not both). Define\n\u03a31/2 (g, a) = {\u03b1 \u2208 \u03a3(g, a) | 21 \u03b1 6\u2208 \u03a3(g, a)} .\nThen \u03a31/2 (g, a) is a root system in the usual sense and the Weyl group corresponding to \u03a3(g, a) is the\nsame as the Weyl group generated by the reflections s\u03b1 , \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a31/2 (g, a). Furthermore, M is irreducible\nif and only if \u03a31/2 (g, a) is irreducible, i.e., can not be decomposed into two mutually orthogonal root\nsystems.\n+\n+\nLet \u03a3+ (g, a) \u2282 \u03a3(g, a) be a positive system and \u03a3+\n1/2 (g, a) = \u03a3 (g, a) \u2229 \u03a31/2 (g, a). Then \u03a31/2 (g, a) is\na positive system in \u03a31/2 (g, a). Denote by \u03a81/2 (g, a) = {\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1r }, r = dim a, the set of simple roots\nin \u03a3+\n1/2 (g, a). Then \u03a81/2 (g, a) is a basis for \u03a3(g, a). We will always assume that \u03a81/2 is not one of the\nexceptional root system and we number the simple roots in the following way:\n\n\f6\n\nGESTUR \u00d3LAFSSON AND JOSEPH A.

Following the\nabove discussion, this will only change the simple root at the right end of the Dynkin diagram. If \u03a82 (g, a)\nis of type B the root system \u03a32 (g, a) will be of type C.\nThe classical irreducible symmetric spaces are given by the following table.1 The fifth column lists\nK as a subgroup of the compact real form.

We write \u03a3n , \u03a3+\nn and Wn for \u03a3(gn , an ), \u03a3 (gn , an ) and W (gn , an ). We say that Mk\npropagates Mn , if Gn j Gk , Kn = Kk \u2229 Gn , and either ak = an or choosing an j ak we only add simple\nroots to the left end of the Dynkin diagram for \u03a8n,1/2 to obtain the Dynkin diagram for \u03a8k,1/2 . So, in\nparticular \u03a8n,1/2 and \u03a8k,1/2 are of the same type. In general, if Mk and Mn are riemannian symmetric\ngk respectively M\ng\nspaces of compact or noncompact type, with universal covering M\nn , then Mk propagates\nj\n1\nf\nf\nMn if we can enumerate the irreducible factors of Mk = Mk \u00d7 . . . \u00d7 Mk and Mn = Mn1 \u00d7 . . . \u00d7 Mni , i \u2266 j\nso that Mks propagates Mns for s = 1, . . . , i. Thus, each Mn is, up to covering, a product of irreducible\nfactors listed in Table 2.2.\nIn general we can construct infinite sequences of propagations by moving along each row in Table\n2.2. But there are also inclusions like SL(n, R)/SO(n) \u2282 SL(k, C)/SU(k) which satisfy the definition of\npropagation.\nWhen gk propagates gn , and \u03b8k and \u03b8n are the corresponding involutions with \u03b8k |gn = \u03b8n , the corresponding eigenspace decompositions gk = kk \u2295 sk and gn = kn \u2295 sn give us\nkn = kk \u2229 gn ,\n\nand sn = gn \u2229 sk .\n\nWe recursively choose maximal commutative subspaces ak \u2282 sk such that an j ak for k \u2267 n.

Note, that we are using M in two different ways, once as the symmetric space M and also as\na subgroup of G. The meaning will always be clear from the context.\nWe have the Iwasawa decomposition\nG = KAN : C \u03c9 \u2013diffeomorphic to K \u00d7 A \u00d7 N under (k, a, n) 7\u2192 kan .\n\nFor x \u2208 G define k(x) \u2208 K and a(x) \u2208 A by x \u2208 k(x)a(x)N .

One can prove this using a Weyl basis for gC (see, for example, [20, page 285]). But the simplest\nproof is to note that we can replace SO(2j, C)/SO(2j) by O(2j, C)/O(2j).

Similar construction can also be done for the other\ncase SOo (p, p)/SO(p) \u00d7 SO(p) by replacing SOo (p, p) by O(p, p).\n\u0003\nIn the general case we let \u03c3\ne be the identity on factors not of type D and the above constructed\ninvolution \u03c3\ne on factors of type D. Similar for the involution \u03c3 on a and a\u2217 . We need to extend K to a\ne acting on M . In case the irreducible factor is not of type D then the corresponding K-factor\ne\ngroup K\nis\nf\njust K and otherwise K \u22ca {1, \u03c3\ne }. Note that W (g, a) = NKe (A)/ZKe (A).\nTheorem 3.3. We have \u03c6\u03bb (e\n\u03c3 (x)) = \u03c6\u03c3(\u03bb) (x) and F (f \u25e6 \u03c3\ne )(\u03bb) = F (f )(\u03c3(\u03bb)) whenever f \u2208 Cc (M )K . In\ne\n\nparticular, f \u2208 Cc (M )K if and only if F (f ) is \u03c3-invariant.\n\nProof. This follows from\nk(e\n\u03c3 (x))a(e\n\u03c3 (x))n(e\n\u03c3 (x))\n\n=\n=\n\n\u03c3(x) = \u03c3\ne(k(x)a(x)n(x))\n\u03c3\ne(k(x))e\n\u03c3 (a(x))e\n\u03c3 (n(x))\n\nand hence a(e\n\u03c3 (x)) = \u03c3\ne(a(x)).

Central Functions on Compact Lie Groups\nThe following results on compact Lie groups are a special case of the more general statements on compact\nsymmetric spaces discussed in the next section, as every group can be viewed as a symmetric space\nG \u00d7 G/diag(G) via the map\n(g, 1)diag(G) 7\u2192 g, in other words (a, b)diag(G) 7\u2192 ab\u22121\n\ncorresponding to the involution \u03c4 (a, b) = (b, a). The action of G\u00d7G is the left-right action (L\u00d7R)(a, b)*x =\naxb\u22121 and the diag(G)\u2013invariant functions are the central functions f (axa\u22121 ) = f (x) for all a, x \u2208 G.\nThus f is central if and only if f \u25e6 Ad(a) = f for all a \u2208 G, where as usual Ad(a)(x) = axa\u22121 . But it\nis still worth treating this case separately, first because the normalization of the Fourier transform on G\nviewed as a group is different from the normalization as a symmetric space, and second because the proof\nof the Paley-Wiener Theorem for compact symmetric spaces in [14] was by reduction to this case, as was\noriginally done in [6].\nIn this section G, Gn and Gk will denote compact connected semisimple Lie groups. For simplicity,\nwe will assume that those groups are simply connected. For the general case one needs to change the\nsemi-lattice of highest weights of irreducible representations and the injectivity radius, whose numerical\nvalue does not play an important rule in the following. The invariant measures on compact groups and\nhomogeneous spaces are normalized to total mass one.\nWe say that Gk propagates Gn if gk propagates gn . This is the same as saying that Gk propagates\nGn as a symmetric space. We fix a Cartan subalgebra hk of gk such that hn := hk \u2229 gn is a Cartan\nsubalgebra of gn . We use the notation from the previous section. The index n respectively k will then\ndenote the corresponding object for Gn respectively Gk . We fix inner products h*, *in on gn and h*, *ik on\ngk such that hX, Y in = hX, Y ik for X, Y \u2208 gn j gk . This can be done by viewing Gn \u2282 Gk as locally\nisomorphic to linear groups and use the trace form X, Y 7\u2192 \u2212Tr (XY ). We denote by R the injectivity\nradius. Theorem 4.1 below shows that the injectivity radius is the same for Gn and Gk .\nThe following is a reformulation of results of Crittenden [4]. A case by case inspection of each of the\nroot systems gives us\nTheorem 4.1. The injectivity radius of the classical compact simply connected\n\u221a Lie groups G, in the\nriemannian metric given by the inner product hX, Y i = \u2212Tr (XY ) on g, is 2 \u03c0 for SU (m + 1) and\nSp(m), 2\u03c0 for SO(2m) and SO(2m + 1). In particular for each of the four classical series the injectivity\nradius R is independent of m.\nDenote by \u039b+ (G) \u2282 ih\u2217 the set of dominant integral weights,\nn\no\n+\n+\n\u039b+ (G) = \u03bc \u2208 ih\u2217 ) 2h\u03bc,\u03b1i\n.\nh\u03b1,\u03b1i \u2208 Z for all \u03b1 \u2208 \u2206 (gC , hC )\n\n\f12\n\nGESTUR \u00d3LAFSSON AND JOSEPH A.

If v is a nonzero highest weight vector in V\u03bck then h\u03c0\u03bck (Gn )vi is\nirreducible and isomorphic to V\u03bcn . Furthermore, \u03c0\u03bcn occurs with multiplicity one in \u03c0\u03bck |Gn .\nProof. Each Gn \u2013irreducible summand W in h\u03c0\u03bck (Gn )vi has highest weight \u03bcn . Fix one such Gn \u2013\nsubmodule W and let w \u2208 W be P\na nonzero highest weight vector. Write w = w1 + . . . + ws where\n+\neach wj is of some hk \u2013weight \u03bck \u2212 i kj,i\nPk , hk ) and each\nP\u03b2i and where each \u03b2i is a simple root in \u03a3 (g\n+\nkj,i \u2208 Z . As \u03bck |hn = \u03bcn it follows that h i kj,i \u03b2i |hn , \u03b1i = 0 for all \u03b1 \u2208 \u2206(gn , hn ). Thus i kj,i \u03b2i |hn = 0.\nIn view of (2.1) each h\u03b2i , \u03b1j i \u2266 0 for \u03b1j \u2208 \u2206(gn , hn ) simple (specifically h\u03b2i , \u03b1j i = 0 unless \u03b2i = fc+1 \u2212 fc\nand \u03b1j = fc \u2212 fc\u22121 , for some c, in which case h\u03b2i , \u03b1j i = \u22121). Since every kj,i \u2208 Z+ now h\u03b2i , \u03b1j i = 0 for\neach \u03b1j \u2208 \u2206(gn , hn ) simple. Thus \u03b2i |hn = 0.\n\nBecause of the compatibility of the positive systems \u2206+ (gk,C , hk,C ) and \u2206+ (gn,C , hn,C ) there exists a\n\u03b2 \u2208 \u2206+ (gk,C , hk,C ), \u03b2|hn = 0, such that \u03bck \u2212 \u03b2 is a weight in V\u03bcn . Writing \u03b2 as a sum of simple roots,\nwe see that each of the simple roots has to vanish on an and hence the restriction to ak can not contain\nany of the simple roots \u03b1k,j , j = 1, . . . , rn . But then \u03b2 is perpendicular to the fundamental weights \u03bek,j ,\nj = 1, . . . , rn . Hence s\u03b2 (\u03bcn \u2212 \u03b2) = \u03bcn + \u03b2 is also a weight, contradicting the fact that \u03bcn is the highest\nweight. (Here s\u03b2 is the reflection in the hyperplane \u03b2 = 0.) This shows that \u03c0\u03bcn can only occur once in\nh\u03c0\u03bck (Gn )vi. In particular, h\u03c0\u03bck (Gn )vi is irreducible.\n\u0003\nLemma 5.8 allows us to form direct system of representations, as follows.

We use the\nsame notation as before and add the index n (or k) to indicate the dependence of the space Mn (or Mk ).\nWe start with the following lemma.\nLemma 7.10. If k \u2267 n then \u03a9\u2217n = \u03a9\u2217k \u2229 an .\n\n\fTHE PALEY-WIENER THEOREM AND LIMITS OF SYMMETRIC SPACES\n\n21\n\nProof. We can assume that M is irreducible. As Mk propagates Mn it follows that we are only adding\nsimple roots to the left on the Dynkin diagram for \u03a32 . Let rn denote the rank of Mn and rk the rank\nof Mk . We can assume that rn < rk , as the claim is obvious for rn = rk . We use the above explicit\ndescription \u03a9\u2217 given above and case by case inspection:\nAssume that \u03a3n,2 is of type Arn and \u03a3k,2 is of type Ark with rn < rk . It follows from (7.2) that\n\u03a9\u2217n j \u03a9\u2217k \u2229 an . Let (0, x) \u2208 \u03a9\u2217n .

Then, using that xi = \u2212\n\u2212rk \u03c02 <\n\nX\ni6=j\n\nP\n\nj6=i\n\nfor j \u2266 rn + 1\nfor j > rn + 1 \u2267 i\nfor j, i > rn + 1\n\nxj and |xi \u2212 xj | < \u03c0/2, we get\n\n(xi \u2212 xj ) = rk xi \u2212\n\nX\n\nxj = (rk + 1)xi < rk \u03c02 .\n\nj6=i\n\nHence\nk\n\u2212 \u03c02 < \u2212 rkr+1\n\n\u03c0\n2\n\n< xi <\n\nrk \u03c0\nrk +1 2\n\n<\n\n\u03c0\n2\n\n.\n\nIt follows now from (7.11) that (0, x) \u2208 \u03a9\u2217k \u2229 an .\nThe cases of types B and C are obvious from (7.3) and (7.4). For the case of type D we note that\n|xi \u00b1 xj | < \u03c04 implies both - \u03c04 < xi \u2212 xj < \u03c04 and - \u03c04 < xi + xj < \u03c04 . Adding, - \u03c02 < 2xi < \u03c02 , so |xi | < \u03c04 .\nHence (0, x) \u2208 \u03a9\u2217k \u2229 an if and only if x \u2208 \u03a9\u2217n by (7.5).\n\u0003\nWe can now proceed as in Section 3. We will always assume that S > 0 is small enough that \u03a9\u2217 contains\ne\ne\nthe closed ball in s of radius S.

Comparison with the L2 Theory\nTheorem 7.15 is based on limits of C \u221e and Cc\u221e spaces, rather than isometric immersions, L2 spaces,\nand unitary representation theory. Just as the L2 space of a compact symmetric space is the Hilbert\nspace completion of the corresponding C \u221e space, it is now known [24, Proposition 3.27] that the same is\ntrue for inductive limits of compact symmetric spaces. Here we discuss those inductive limit L2 spaces,\nclarifying the connection between Paley\u2013Wiener theory and L2 Fourier transform theory.\nAny consideration of the projective limit of L2 spaces follows similar lines by replacing the the maps of\nthe inductive limit by the corresponding orthogonal projections, because inductive and projective limits\nare the same in the Hilbert space category.\nThe material of this section is taken from [22, Section 3] and [24, Section 3] and adapted to our setting.\nWe assume without further comments that all extensions are propagations.\nThere are three steps to the comparison. First, we describe the construction of a direct limit Hilbert\nspace L2 (M\u221e ) := lim{L2 (Mn ), Lm,n } that carries a natural multiplicity\u2013free unitary action of G\u221e .\n\u2212\u2192\nThen we describe the ring A(M\u221e ) := lim{A(Mn ), \u03bdm,n } of regular functions on M\u221e where A(Mn )\n\u2212\u2192\nconsists of the finite linear combinations of the matrix coefficients of the \u03c0\u03bc with \u03bc \u2208 \u039b+\nn (Gn , Kn )\nand such that \u03bdm,n (f )|Mn = f . Thus A(M\u221e ) is a (rather small) G\u221e \u2013submodule of the projective\nlimit lim{A(Mn ), restriction}. Third, we describe a {Gn }\u2013equivariant morphism {A(Mn ), \u03bdm,n }\n\u2190\u2212\n{L2 (Mn ), Lm,n } of direct systems that embeds A(M\u221e ) as a dense G\u2013submodule of L2 (M\u221e ), so that\nL2 (M\u221e ) is G\u221e \u2013isomorphic to a Hilbert space completion of the function space A(M\u221e ).\nWe recall first some basic facts about the vector valued Fourier transform on Mn as well as the\n+\ndecomposition of L2 (Mn ) into irreducible summands. To simplify notation write \u039b+\nn for \u039b (Gn , Kn ).\n+\nLet \u03bc \u2208 \u039bn and let Vn,\u03bc denote the irreducible Gn \u2013module of highest weight \u03bc. Recursively in n, we\nchoose a highest weight vector vn,\u03bc \u2208 Vn,\u03bc and and a Kn \u2013invariant unit vector en,\u03bc \u2208 V\u03bcKn such that (i)\nVn\u22121,\u03bc \u0592\u2192 Vn,\u03bc is isometric and Gn\u22121 \u2013equivariant and sends vn\u22121,\u03bc to a multiple of vn,\u03bc , (ii) orthogonal\nprojection Vn,\u03bc \u2192 Vn\u22121,\u03bc sends en,\u03bc to a non\u2013negative real multiple cn,n\u22121,\u03bc en\u22121,\u03bc of en\u22121,\u03bc , and (iii)\nhvn,\u03bc , en,\u03bc i = 1. (Then 0 < cn,n\u22121,\u03bc \u2266 1.)

Specifically, that left regular representation\nis\nI\u2208I \u03c0I\nP\nwhere \u03c0I = lim \u03c0I,n is the irreducible representation of G\u221e with highest weight \u03beI :=\nkr \u03ber . This applies\n\u2212\u2192\nto all the direct systems of (7.13).\n\n\fTHE PALEY-WIENER THEOREM AND LIMITS OF SYMMETRIC SPACES\n\n25\n\nThe problem with the partial isometries Lm,n is that they do not work well with restriction of functions,\nbecause of rescaling and because Lm,n (L2 (Mn )Kn ) 6\u2282 L2 (Mm )Km for n < m. In particular the spherical\nfunctions \u03c8I,n (g) := heI,n , \u03c0I,n (g)eI,n )i do not map forward, in other words Lm,n (\u03c8I,n ) 6= \u03c8I,m .\nWe deal with this by viewing L2 (M\u221e ) as a Hilbert space completion of the ring A(M\u221e ) := lim A(Mn )\n\u2212\u2192\nof regular functions on M\u221e . Adapting [24, Section 3] to our notation, we define\n(8.10)\n\nA(\u03c0n,\u03bc )Kn = {finite linear combinations of the f\u03bc,In ,wI where wI \u2208 Vn,\u03bc },\n\u03bdm,n,\u03bc : A(\u03c0n,\u03bc )Kn \u0592\u2192 A(\u03c0m,\u03bc )Km by f\u03bc,In ,wI 7\u2192 f\u03bc,Im ,wI .\n\nThus [24, Lemma 2.30] says that if f \u2208 A(\u03c0n,\u03bc )Kn then \u03bdm,n,\u03bc (f )|Mn = f .\nP\nThe ring of regular functions on Mn is A(Mn ) := A(Gn )Kn = \u03bc A(\u03c0n,\u03bc ), and the \u03bdm,n,\u03bc sum to\ndefine a direct system {A(Mn ), \u03bdm,n }. Its limit is\n\nA(M\u221e ) := A(G\u221e )K\u221e = lim{A(Mn ), \u03bdm,n }.\n\u2212\u2192\nAs just noted, the maps of the direct system {A(Mn ), \u03bdm,n } are inverse to restriction of functions, so\nA(M\u221e ) is a G\u221e \u2013submodule of the inverse limit lim{A(Mn ), restriction}.\n\u2190\u2212\nFor each n, A(Mn ) is a dense subspace of L2 (Mn ) but, because the \u03bdm,n distort the Hilbert space\nstructure, A(M\u221e ) does not sit naturally as a subspace of L2 (M\u221e ). Thus we use the Gn \u2013equivariant\nmaps\np\nb n,\u03bc\u2217 C) by f\u03bc,In ,wI 7\u2192 cn,1,\u03bc deg \u03c0n,\u03bc f\u03bc,In ,wI .\n(8.12)\n\u03b7n,\u03bc : A(\u03c0n,\u03bc )Kn \u2192 H\u03c0n \u2297(w\n(8.11)\n\nwhere cm,n,\u03bc is the length of the projection of em,\u03bc to Vn,\u03bc . Now [24, Proposition 3.27] says\nProposition 8.13. The maps Lm,n,\u03bc of (8.6), \u03bdm,n,\u03bc of (8.10) and \u03b7n,\u03bc of (8.12) satisfy\n(\u03b7m,\u03bc \u25e6 \u03bdm,n,\u03bc )(f\u03bc,In ,wI ) = (Lm,n,\u03bc \u25e6 \u03b7n,\u03bc )(f\u03bc,In ,wI )\n\nfor fu,v,n \u2208 A(\u03c0n,\u03bc ) . Thus they inject the direct system {A(Mn ), \u03bdm,n } into the direct system {L2 (Mn ), Lm,n }.\nThat map of direct systems defines a G\u221e \u2013equivariant injection\nKn\n\n\u03b7e : A(M\u221e ) \u2192 L2 (M\u221e )\n\nwith dense image. In particular \u03b7 defines a pre Hilbert space structure on A(M\u221e ) with completion\nisometric to L2 (M\u221e ).\nThis describes L2 (M\u221e ) as an ordinary Hilbert space completion of a natural function space on M\u221e .\nReferences\n[1] S.
