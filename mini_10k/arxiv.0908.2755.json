ALGERIA.\nOctober 31, 2018\n\nAbstract\nFrom the freedom exhibited by the generalized Einstein action\nproposed in [1], we show that we can construct the standard effective Einstein-Cartan action coupled to the fermionic matter without\nthe usual current-current interaction and therefore an effective action\nwhich does not depend neither on the Immirzi parameter nor on the\ntorsion. This establishes the equivalence between the Einstein-Cartan\ntheory and the theory of the general relativity minimally coupled to\nthe fermionic matter.\n\nIn the last few years, the \"tetrad-connection\" form of the Einstein gravitational action modified by the Holst term [2] is used as a starting point\nof the non-perturbative quantization of gravity [3] [4], [5] (and references\ntherein). This modified action, which depends on a new dimensionless parameter known as the Barbero-Immirzi (BI) parameter [6], [7], does not modify\nthe classical vacuum Einstein equations. But in presence of minimally coupling of fermionic matter a nonvanishing torsion emerges leading to equations\nof motion which depend on this parameter [8], [9], [10]. This nonvanishing\ntorsion appears in the effective action under the form of a current-current\ninteraction term with a coupling constant determined by the BI parameter.\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\ne-mail : meriem.lagraa@gmail.com\ne-mail : m.lagraa@lycos.com\n\n1\n\n\fThus, even at the classical level the effects of this parameter must be observed. This leads to bring up the question about its physical origin which\nis still debated in many works where different interpretations are proposed.\nIn vacuum, a possible interpretation of the BI parameter as an analog of\nthe \u03b8 parameter that describes the different sectors associated to the topological structure of large gauge transformation in Yang-Mills theory is proposed\nin [11]. In [12] this analogy is investigated within the framework of the\nEinstein-Cartan theory nonminimally coupled to the fermionic matter where\nit is shown that when the equation of motion of the connection is satisfied\nthe sum of the Holst term and the nonminimal term of the fermionic sector\nreduces to a term where the BI parameter becomes a coefficient of the NiehYan [13] topological invariant which is a total divergence not affecting the\nequations of motion and therefore does not modify the usual second order\neffective action of Einstein-Cartan coupled to the fermionic matter. This\ntopological interpretation of the BI parameter is analyzed in [14], [15] where\nthe topological term is played by the Nieh-Yan density. It is also shown in\n[16] that the BI parameter is not detectable in classical theory even after\nnonminimal coupling of fermions. Much more, the BI parameter is promoted\nto be a field interacting with gravity rather than a constant in [17], [18], [19],\n[20], especially in [21] where it is shown that the chiral anomaly is reabsorbed\nby a redefinition of the BI field. More recently a different interpretation is\nproposed in [22] where, from the extension of the Plebanski theory, it is\nshown that the BI parameter is related to the cosmological constant.\nIn the above-mentioned works the incorporation of the nonminimal coupling of the fermionic matter into the Einstein-Cartan theory permits to\ndiscard the effects of the BI parameter but not the current-current interaction term in the effective action. This makes the physical predictions of the\nEinstein-Cartan theory different from those of the theory of general relativity which does not contain spin-spin interaction induced by a nonvanishing\ntorsion. Let us recall that, up to now, the experimental successes of the standard model of particle physics and of the theory of general relativity seem\nto be in favor of the minimal coupling procedure free of the torsion of the\nconnection.\nIn a previous paper [1], the Einstein-Cartan action is generalized by\nadding an infinity of non trivial local actions which lead to the classical vacuum Einstein equations. In this paper we show that we can deduce, from this\ngeneralized action, the usual second order effective action of Einstein-Cartan\ntheory minimally coupled to fermionic matter without current-current interaction term nor BI parameter-dependent and therefore an Einstein-Cartan\ntheory minimally coupled to fermionic matter equivalent to the theory of general relativity with fermions where the torsion of the connection is assumed\n2\n\n\fto vanish.\nWe start with the gravity action proposed in [1] which we couple minimally to the standard real Dirac Lagrangian\n1\nS(e, \u03c9, \u03a8) =\n2k\n\nZ \u0012\n\n\u0013\n1\n1 I\nI\nJ\nKL\n2\n\u01ebIJKL e \u2227 e \u2227 \u03a9 + \u0398 \u2227 \u0398I + F (\u0398 )\u01eb\n2\n\u03b3\n\nM\n\ni\n\u2212\n2\n\nZ\n\nM\n\n\u0001\n\u2217eI \u2227 \u03a8\u03b3 I D\u03a8 \u2212 c.c .\n\n(1)\n\nHere M is the 4-dimensional space-time manifold, I, J... \u2208 [0, 1, 2, 3]\nare internal Lorentz indices, \u01ebIJKL are the components of the totally antisymmetric Levi-Cevita symbol, \u01eb0123 = 1 = \u2212\u01eb0123 and eI = eI\u03bc dx\u03bc is\nthe co-tetrad one-form valued in the vectorial representation space endowed\nwith the flat metric \u03b7IJ = diag(\u22121, 1, 1, 1). The metric \u03b7 IJ and its inverse \u03b7IJ are used to lower and to lift the Lorentz indices and to determine\nthe metric g\u03bc\u03bd = eI\u03bc eJ\u03bd \u03b7IJ of the tangent space of the manifold M. \u03a9IJ\n= d\u03c9 IJ + \u03c9 IN \u2227 \u03c9 N J is the curvature two-form associated to the connection\n\u03bc\nIJ\nK\nvalued in the Lorentz Lie algebra and\none-form \u03c9 IJ = \u03c9 IJ\n\u03bc dx = \u03c9 K \u2227 e\nk = 8\u03c0G where G is Newton's gravitational constant in unit c = 1.\nIn the second term of (1)\n\u0398I = DeI = deI + \u03c9 IK \u2227 eK = \u0398IKL eK \u2227 eL\nis the torsion two-form and D is the exterior covariant derivative. From the\nidentity\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0398I \u2227 \u0398I = d eI \u2227 DeI + eI \u2227 DDeI = d eI \u2227 DeI + eI \u2227 eJ \u2227 \u03a9IJ\n\nwe see that this term is equivalent, up to the surface term which is the NiehYan [13] topological invariant, to the one of Holst. Hence \u03b3 can be identified\nto the BI parameter assumed to be real in the following.\nIn the third term of the action (1), F is a C \u221e real function of the scalar\n2\n\u0398 given by \u0398I \u2227 \u2217\u0398I = \u03982 \u01eb, where \u03b5 = 4!1 \u01ebIJKLeI \u2227 eJ \u2227 eK \u2227 eL = ed4 x = \u22171\nis the volume form and e = det(e) is the determinant of eI\u03bc .\nIn the tetrad formalism, the dual map \u2217 acts as\n\u0001\n\u2217 eI1 \u2227 ... \u2227 eIq =\n\n1\nI ...I\n\u01eb1 q\n(4 \u2212 q)!\n\nIq+1\nIq+1 ...I4 e\n\n\u2227 ... \u2227 eI4\n\nwhich by linearity determines the action \u2217 on any differential form.\n3\n\n(2)\n\n\fFinally in the fourth term, \u03b3 I are Dirac matrices and the exterior covariIJ\nant derivative D acts on the Dirac spinors \u03a8 as D\u03a8 = d\u03a8 + \u03c92 \u03c3 IJ \u03a8 where\n\u03c3 IJ = 41 [\u03b3 I , \u03b3 J ] are the generators of the Lie algebra of the Lorentz group in\nthe Dirac spinorial representation. \"c.c\" indicates the complex conjugate of\nthe preceding term.\nDue to the signature of the metric \u03b7 IJ = 12 (\u03b3 I \u03b3 J + \u03b3 J \u03b3 I ), the Dirac\nmatrices satisfy the following properties: (\u03b3 0 )2 = \u2212I, (\u03b3 i )2 = I, \u03b3 \u2020I = \u03b3 0 \u03b3 I \u03b3 0 ,\nIJ\n\u03b3 0 \u03c3 \u2020KL = \u2212\u03c3 KL \u03b3 0 leading to D\u03a8 = d\u03a8\u2212\u03a8\u03c3 IJ \u03c92 where \u03a8 = \u03a8\u2020 \u03b3 0 with \u03a8\u2020 is\nthe Hermitian conjugation of the column \u03a8. These Dirac matrix properties\nlead to the relations\n[\u03b3 M , \u03c3 KL ]+ = \u2212i\u01ebM KLN \u03b3 5 \u03b3 N and [\u03b3 M , \u03c3 KL ] = \u03b7 M K \u03b3 L \u2212 \u03b7M L \u03b3 K\nwhere \u03b3 5 = i\u03b3 0 \u03b3 1 \u03b3 2 \u03b3 3 satisfying \u03b3 \u20205 = \u03b3 5 and (\u03b3 5 )2 = I.\nWith respect to an arbitrary variation of the connection, the principle of\nleast action gives the following equation\n\u0012\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0013\n1 \u2032 KL I P Q\nk KL\n+ F \u03b4 [IJ] \u0398 P Q \u01eb N M \u2212 \u03b4 [N M ] JJ eN \u2227eM \u2227eJ = 0.\n2\n4\n(3)\n\u0001\n[IJ]\nI J\nI J\nIJ\n1\nI\nI\nwhere \u03b4 [KL] = 2 \u03b4 K \u03b4 L \u2212 \u03b4 L \u03b4 K = \u03b4 KL and J = \u03a8\u03b3 5 \u03b3 \u03a8 is the axial\nfermionic current.

As we show below, this apparent inconsistency, caused\nby the Holst term which is not invariant under the parity transformation,\ndoes not affect the effective action. In fact, in its absence which corresponds\nto the limiting case \u03b3 \u2212\u2192 \u221e, we deduce from (10), (7) and (6) the equations\nT IJK = 0, \u039bL = 0, AL =\n\n5\n\n8\n\nk\n\u0001J L\n\u2212 21\n\nF\u2032\n\n(12)\n\n\fwhich are invariant under the parity transformation and defined when the\nimage Im(F \u2032 ) of F \u2032 is disjoint of the points \u22121, 2 and 21 . This condition is the\nsame as the one of the pure gravitational sector where the Einstein-Cartan\ntheory becomes equivalent to the theory of general relativity [1].\nIn order to determine the contributions coming from the different irreducible components (4) of the torsion to the action (1), we have to solve the\nstructure equation DeI = deI + \u03c9 IJ \u2227 eJ = \u0398I by splitting the connection\n\u03c9 IJ into two parts \u03c9 IJ = \u03c9\ne (e)IJ + C IJ where \u03c9\ne IJ (e) is the uniquely dee I=\nfined torsion-free so(3, 1) spin connection compatible with the tetrad, De\nI\nI\nJ\nIJ\nIJ\n\u03bc\nIJ\nK\nde + \u03c9\ne J \u2227 e = 0, and C = C \u03bc dx = C K e is the contortion one-form.\nTo get a metric connection, D\u03b7 IJ = 0, the contortion must satisfy C IJ +\nC JI = 0.

In its absence, \u03b3 \u2212\u2192 \u221e, F \u2032 = 2 is a singular point which makes the trace component\nundetermined with or without fermionic matter. This undetermined trace\ncomponent does not appear to have any physical significance as we see it from\n(18); in fact if \u03b3 \u2212\u2192 \u221e and if we consider the solution F (\u03982 ) = 2\u03982 of the\nequation F \u2032 = 2 the trace component disappears but an arbitrary variation\nk\nJ I leading to an\nwith respect to T IJK and AI gives T IJK = 0 and AI = 12\nk\nI\ncurrent-current interaction term 16 J JI in the effective action.\nWe conclude this work by emphasizing that as opposite to the usual\ntetrad form of the gravitational action with fermions where a torsion emerges\nunder the form of current-current interaction which is either \u03b3-dependent in\nthe Holst-modified Einstein-Cartan theory or \u03b3-independent in presence of\nnonminimally coupled fermionic matter, we have shown that if, in addition to\nthe\nZ Holst-modified Einstein-cartan theory, we add a torsion term of the form\n1\n\u0398I \u2227\u2217\u0398I (25) we obtain an effective Einstein-Cartan theory minimally\nk\nM\n\ncoupled to the fermionic matter (26) where neither the torsion, which induces\nthe current-current interaction, nor the BI parameter take place. Therefore,\nthe generalized Einstein-Cartan action (25) is equivalent to the theory of the\ngeneral relativity minimally coupled to the fermionic matter. Note that this\nequivalence is not based on a completely vanishing torsion, its irreducible\ntrace component does not vanish (24). This leads to a space-time manifold\nwith a nonvanishing torsion depending on the BI parameter which does not\ninduce physical effects because of its absence in the effective action (26).\nWe have also shown that if we add to the\naction a nonZ Einstein-Cartan\n\u0010 2\n\u221a \u0011\n1\n\u0398\npolynomial term in torsion of the form 2k\n+ c \u03982 \u01eb we obtain an\n2\nM\n\neffective action equivalent to the theory of the general relativity minimally\ncoupled to the fermionic matter. This equivalence is not based on a van11\n\n\fishing torsion also, its irreducible completely antisymmetric component does\nnot vanish (22). In spite of the fact that it is related to the fermionic current,\nit is an inert quantity which does not affect the evolution equations. Note\nthat we can see from (22) that the presence of the fermionic matter is necessary in this case because in its absence we can not obtain a vanishing torsion\nwhich is a condition to have an equivalence in pure gravitational sector.\n\nReferences\n[1] M.
