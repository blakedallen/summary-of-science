Carroll 'Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'\n\nA FEW RIDDLES BEHIND ROLLE'S THEOREM\n\nB. Shapiro\u2020 , M. Shapiro\u2021\n\u2020\n\n\u2021\n\nDepartment of Mathematics, University of\nStockholm, S-10691, Sweden, shapiro@math.su.se\nDepartment of Mathematics, Michigan State University, East Lansing,\nMI 48824-1027, USA, mshapiro@math.msu.edu\n\nGetting started\nFirst year undergraduates usually learn about the classical Rolle's theorem saying that\nbetween two consecutive zeros of a smooth function f one can always find at least one zero\nof its derivative f \u2032 . In this paper we study a generalization of Rolle's theorem dealing with\nthe zeros of higher derivatives for a class of smooth functions which we call n-nice. For such\nfunctions we obtain some mysteriously looking additional inequalities governing the mutual\narrangement of the zeros of different derivatives. The considered topic is so classical that\nwe find it impossible to be sure that our results are new. However, we were unable to trace\nanything similar in the literature although such facts might have been known to at least\nChevalier Augustin Cauchy if not to Sir Isaac Newton himself.\nConsider a smooth function f that on a certain interval has n distinct real zeros which we\n(0)\n(0)\n(0)\ndenote by x1 < x2 < . . . < xn . Then, by the classical Rolle's theorem, f \u2032 has at least\n(0)\n(0)\n(n \u2212 1) zeros, f \u2032\u2032 has at least (n \u2212 2) zeros, ... , f (n\u22121) has at least one zero on (x1 , xn ).\nWe call a smooth function f having n simple real zeros on some interval an n-nice function if\nfor all i = 0, . . . , n the i-th derivative f (i) has on the same interval exactly (n\u2212i) zeros denoted\n(i)\n(i)\n(i)\nby x1 < x2 < ... < xn\u2212i . Note that we require, in particular, that f (n) is nonvanishing!\nObserve also that if f is n-nice on I then for all i < n its derivative f (i) is (n \u2212 i)-nice on the\nsame interval. As a natural example of an n-nice function on the whole R one can take any\npolynomial of degree n with only real and distinct zeros. In the above notation the following\nsystem of inequalities holds\n(1)\n\n(i)\n\n(j)\n\nxl < xl\n\n(i)\n\n< xl+j\u2212i ;\n\ni < j \u2264 n \u2212 l.\n\nWe call this system the standard Rolle's restrictions.\n\u0001\n(i)\nWith any n-nice function f we can associate the arrangement Af of all n+1\nzeros {xl }\n2\n(0)\n(1)\nof f (i) , i = 0, . . . , n \u2212 1; 1 \u2264 l \u2264 n \u2212 i, say, taking first all xl then all xl etc.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nSHAPIRO & SHAPIRO\n\nThe main problem we address in this note is as follows.\n(i)\n\nQuestion. What additional restrictions besides (1) exist on the arrangements\n\u0001 Af = {xl }\nn+1\nfor n-nice functions? Or even more ambitiously, given an arrangement of 2 real numbers\n(i)\nA = {xl | i = 0, . . . , n \u2212 1; l = 1, . . . n \u2212 i} satisfying the standard Rolle's restrictions is it\npossible to say if there exist an n-nice function f such that Af = A?\n\nOur choice of the class of n-nice functions is motivated by the (easy to formalize) idea\nthat as soon as one allows several real zeros of f \u2032 in between two consecutive zeros of f then\nno interesting additional restrictions are possible. Also this class seems to be the natural\ngeneralization of the well-studied class of real polynomials with all real zeros.\nWe will soon discover that the fact that a smooth function is n-nice implies additional\ninequalities on the components of Af . Notice that the set of all n-nice functions on a given\ninterval forms the subset of a larger class of functions which in several aspects behave similarly\nto real polynomials of degree n. Let us now define this smooth analog of polynomials. We\npostpone the discussion of the usual polynomials until the next section.\nMain Definition. A smooth real-valued function f defined on some interval I is called\na pseudopolynomial of degree n on I if f (n) never vanishes.\n\nThe usual Rolle's theorem immediately implies that any pseudopolynomial f of degree n\nhas at most n real zeros (counted with multiplicitites). The set of all n-nice functions on a\ngiven interval coincides with the set of all pseudopolynomials of degree n with exactly n real\nand distinct zeros.\nLet Nn (I) denote the set of all n-nice functions on an interval I. (Since the particular\nchoice of I is unimportant in the formulation below we will often use Nn instead of Nn (I).)\nOur result below answers the posed question for n = 3, i.e., the case of 3-nice functions.\n(Obviously, there are no additional restrictions for n = 2, i.e. on the arrangements of the\ntwo zeros of a smooth function f and one zero of f \u2032 .) In order to make our notation more\nreadable denote the three zeros of a 3-nice function f by x1 < x2 < x3 , the two zeros of f \u2032\nby y1 < y2 and the only zero of f \u2032\u2032 by z1 .\nInequality Theorem. For any 3-nice function f its arrangement Af = (x1 , x2 , x3 , y1 , y2 , z1 )\nsatisfies the following inequalities:\n\n(2)\n\n\uf8f1\nx1 < y 1 < x2 < y 2 < x3\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\ny < z1 < y2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 1\n\u0010\n\u0011\np\n2 + 2(z \u2212 y )|z \u2212 x |\ny\n\u2212\nx\n<\nmin\nx\n\u2212\ny\n,\n(z\n\u2212\ny\n)\n\uf8f4\n1\n1\n2\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\uf8f4\np\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 x3 \u2212 y2 < min y2 \u2212 x2 , (y2 \u2212 z1 )2 + 2(y2 \u2212 z1 )|z1 \u2212 x2 |\n\nAnd, conversely, for any 6-tuple satisfying the above inequalities there exists a 3-nice\nfunction f with that arrangement Af of the zeros of f, f \u2032 , f \u2032\u2032 respectively. (The geometrical\nmeaning of the additional inequalities will be quite clear from the proof of the theorem below.)\nThe inequalities on the first two lines of (2) are the standard Rolle's restrictions. Notice\nthat two remaining new inequalities interchange places under the substitution x 7\u2192 \u2212x.\n\n\fRIDDLES OF ROLLE'S THEOREM\n\n3\n\nProof. Take some f \u2208 N3 . Without loss of generality we can assume f \u2032\u2032\u2032 > 0 implying\nthat f \u2032 is convex (otherwise multiply f by \u22121). As above, the three zeros of f are denoted\nby x1 < x2 < x3 , the two zeros of f \u2032 by y1 < y2 and the only zero of f \u2032\u2032 by z1 . Let us first\nconsider the case x2 < z1 ; see Fig.1.\n\ne\n\na\n\n\u03b1\n\nx2\n\ny1\n\nz1\n\ny\n\n2\n\n\u03b2\n\nx1\n\nx3\n\nb\nd\n\nc\n\nFig. 1. Derivative of f and its accompanying elementary configuration.\nWe will immediately derive the additional inequalities:\np\n(3)\ny1 \u2212 x1 < x2 \u2212 y1 and x3 \u2212 y2 < (y2 \u2212 z1 )2 + 2(y2 \u2212 z1 )(z1 \u2212 x2 ).\nThe case z1 < x2 is completely analogous and leads to:\np\n(4)\nx3 \u2212 y2 < y2 \u2212 x2 and y1 \u2212 x1 < (z1 \u2212 y1 )2 + 2(z1 \u2212 y1 )(x2 \u2212 z1 ).\n\nThe union of (3) and (4) gives exactly the required new inequalities in (2).\nIndeed, the convexity of f \u2032 implies that\ni) on (x1 , y1 ) the graph of f \u2032 lies above the line segment {a, y1 } which is tangent to it at y1 ;\nii) on (y1 , x2 ) the graph of f \u2032 lies between the x-axis and the line segment {y1 , b} which is\ntangent to it at y1 ;\niii) on (x2 , y2 ) the graph of f \u2032 lies between the x-axis and the broken line segment {c, d, y2 }\nwhere (c, d) is horizontal;\niv) on (y2 , x3 ) the graph of f \u2032 lies above the line segment {y2 , e} which is tangent to it at y2 .\nNote that since x1 , x2 , x3 are consecutive real zeros of f then\nZ x2\nZ x3\n\u2032\nf dx =\nf \u2032 dx = 0\nx1\n\nimplying\nZ\n\ny1\n\u2032\n\nx1\n\nf dx = \u2212\n\nZ\n\nx2\n\nx2\n\ny1\n\n\u2032\n\nf dx\n\nand\n\nZ\n\ny2\n\u2032\n\nx2\n\nf dx = \u2212\n\nZ\n\nx3\n\ny2\n\nf \u2032 dx.\n\n\f4\n\nSHAPIRO & SHAPIRO\n\nTherefore,\nAr(\u25b3ax1 y1 ) < Ar(\u25b3y1 bx2 )\n\nand\n\nAr(\u25b3ey2 x3 ) < Ar(\u0003x2 cdy2 ),\n\nwhere Ar stands for the area of the corresponding figures. (The figure \u0003x2 cdy2 is a trapezoid.)\nUsing our knowledge of high-school mathematics we get\nAr(\u25b3ax1 y1 ) =\n\n1\n1\n1\n(y1 \u2212x1 )2 tan \u03b1, Ar(\u25b3ey2 x3 ) = (x3 \u2212y2 )2 tan \u03b2, Ar(\u25b3y1 bx2 ) = (x2 \u2212y2 )2 tan \u03b1,\n2\n2\n2\n\nand,\nAr(\u0003x2 cdy2 ) = Ar(\u25b3z1 dy2 ) + Ar(\u0003x2 cdz1 ) =\n\n1\n(y2 \u2212 z1 )2 tan \u03b2 + (y2 \u2212 z1 )(z1 \u2212 x2 ) tan \u03b2 =\n2\n\n\u0001\n1\n(y2 \u2212 z1 )2 + 2(y2 \u2212 z1 )(z1 \u2212 x2 ) tan \u03b2.\n2\nThese relations immediately imply the required inequalities.\nTo finish the proof, pick any 6-tuple of real numbers x1 , x2 , x3 , y1 , y2 , z1 satisfying (2). We\nagain assume that x2 < z1 . (The case z1 \u2264 x2 is completely analogous.)

As any polynomial\nof degree 3 with real and distinct zeros p(x) is 3-nice.

Illustration of the theorem.\n\nUsual polynomials\nLet us now try to find meaningful restrictions on arrangements Ap for the usual polynomials\nwith all real and distinct zeros. (Note that inequalities (2) remain valid but they clearly do\nnot give all the restrictions since for a usual polynomial its zeros define all the zeros of all its\n(0)\n(0)\n(0)\nhigher derivatives in a unique way.) Let us assume that all n zeros x1 < x2 < . . . < xn\n(i)\nof a polynomial p of degree n are real and distinct. Assume additionally that all xl are\npairwise different. (One can see that this extra condition holds for almost all polynomials\nwith real zeros.) We call such polynomials strictly n-nice. For a strictly n-nice polynomial\np its whole arrangement Ap is naturally ordered on the real line. Substituting each zero of\np by the symbol 0, each zero of p\u2032 by 1, ... \u0001 , each zero of p(n\u22121) by (n \u2212 1) respectively we\nget a symbolic sequence of p of length n+1\nwith n occurrences of 0, (n \u2212 1) occurrences of\n2\n1,..., one occurence of (n \u2212 1) and satisfying the condition that between any two consecutive\noccurrences of the symbol i it has exactly one occurrence of the symbol i + 1.\nFor example, there are only two possible symbolic sequences for n = 3, namely, 012010\nand 010210. For n = 4 there are 12 such sequences 0123012010, 0120312010, 0120132010,\n0102312010, 0102132010, 0123010210, 0120310210, 0120130210, 0120103210, 0123010210,\n0102130210, 0102103210. A patient reader will find the for n = 5 there are 286 such sequences.\n\n\f6\n\nSHAPIRO & SHAPIRO\n\nIf we denote by \u266dn the number of all possible symbolic sequences of length n then actually,\nthis number is possible to calculate. It turns out to be equal to\n\u0013\n\u0012\nn + 1 1!2!...(n \u2212 1)!\n!\n\u266dn =\n.\n2\n1!3!...(2n \u2212 1)!\nBut since this calculation is a content of a different story we refer the interested reader to [6].\nWe can now formulate a natural discrete analog of the main problem from the previous\nsection which makes sense for the usual polynomials.\nQuestion. What symbolic sequences can occur for strictly n-nice polynomials of degree\nn? (We will call such sequences realizable.)\nAs we will see shortly already the first nontrivial case of n = 4 shows that the number\n\u266fn of all realizable symbolic sequences is strictly smaller than the corresponding \u266dn , namely,\n10 = \u266f4 6= \u266d4 = 12.\nThe fact that \u266fn 6= \u266dn was apparently observed by a number of authors but the only\nrelevant reference we found is [1] published in 1993. An explanation of this phenomenon for\nn = 4 is as follows. (See further generalizations in [4].)\nTheorem, see [1]. A polynomial p of degree 4 with real zeros x1 < x2 < x3 < x4\nsatisfying the inequalities x2 < z1 and x3 < z2 , satisfies additionally the inequality y2 < t1 .\nHere y1 < y2 < y3 are the zeros of f \u2032 ; the zeros of f \u2032\u2032 are z1 < z2 and t1 is the zero of f \u2032\u2032\u2032 . In\nother words, the symbolic sequences 0102310210 and 0120132010 are non-realizable.\nThis is easy to check once you know what to prove! Indeed, any monic polynomial of\ndegree 4 with all real zeros can be put in the form x4 \u2212 x2 + ux + v by a linear change of x\nand scaling. Namely, by shifting x 7\u2192 x + \u03b1 we can always get rid of the x3 -term. Since the\nsecond derivative of the obtained polynomial has two real zeros, the coefficient at x2 should\nbe negative. Appropriate\nscaling now puts p in the above form. Note that p\u2032\u2032 = 12x2 \u2212 2,\nq\n\nits zeros being \u00b1 16 . The assumptions x2 < z1 , x3 < z2 together with p having real zeros\nq\nq\nimply p(\u2212 16 ) > 0, p( 16 ) < 0 (draw the graph of p). Noting that p\u2032\u2032\u2032 = 24x what we need\nto prove is thatq\np\u2032 (0) < 0 (drawqthe graph of p\u2032 ). The last inequality is equivalent to u < 0.\n\nExpanding p(\u2212\n\n1\n)\n6\n\n> 0 and p(\n\n1\n)\n6\n\n1\n\u2212 61 \u2212 \u221au6\n36\n2u\n\u221a\n< 0. \u0003\n6\n\n< 0 we get\n\nSubtracting the former from the later implies\n\n+ v > 0 and\n\n1\n36\n\n\u2212 16 + \u221au6 + v < 0.\n\nThe next case n = 5 was considered in [2]. V. Kostov was able to show that among 286 possible symbolic sequences only 116 are realizable by strictly n-nice polynomials. Very recently\nthe same author considered the similar question which symbolic sequences are realizable for\nthe case of n-nice functions; see [3]. It turned out that for n = 4 all 12 symbolic sequences\nare realizable but already for n = 5 there are non-realizable sequences. The situation does\nnot seem to change much if we extend the class of polynomials but n-nice functions.\nTo finish the section let us present a tempting problem posed by the famous mathematician\nVladimir Arnold after the talk given by V. Kostov on his seminar.\nProblem. Is it true that limn\u2192\u221e\n\n\u266fn\n\u266dn\n\n= 0? If yes, how fast does the quotient\n\n\u266fn\n\u266dn\n\ndecrease?\n\n\fRIDDLES OF ROLLE'S THEOREM\n\n7\n\nPeriodic functions\nAt the end let us briefly discuss what happens with periodic functions, i.e., functions\ndefined on a circle. In the previous sections we defined the class of n-nice functions \u2013 a generalization of polynomial of degree n with n distinct real roots \u2013 and found some inequalities\ninvolving the roots of higher derivatives valid for any 3-nice smooth function. It seems quite\nnatural to try to develop a similar concept for periodic functions. The periodic analog of\npolynomials\nPnof degree n are trigonometric polynomials of degree n, i.e., expressions of the\nform a0 + k=1 ak cos kx + bk sin kx. Any trigonometric polynomial of degree n has at most\n2n real zeros on a period.\nObserve that if we take such a trigonometric polynomial with exactly 2n real and distinct\nzeros then its derivative of any order will also be a trigonometric polynomial of the same\ndegree n. Moreover, by the usual Rolle's theorem it will also have exactly 2n real and\ndistinct zeros on a period. So it seems tempting to define a periodic analog of an n-nice\nfunction as a periodic function such that it and its derivatives of any order have exactly 2n\nreal zeros. But (for not completely clear reasons) the situation with periodic functions turns\nout to be much more rigid than with the functions on an interval.\nTo explain the situation we have to invoke the following famous classical result of G. Polya\nand N. Wiener; see [5].\nTheorem. Any periodic function f such that the number of real zeros of the i-th derivative\nf (i) on a period remains bounded as i \u2192 \u221e is a trigonometric polynomial.\nIn particular, any (conjectural) n-nice periodic function must necessarily be an actual\ntrigonometric polynomial. On the other hand, one can define a periodic analog of symbolic\nsequences from the previous section and ask which of those are realizable by trigonometric\npolynomials with all real zeros. Namely, for a positive integer k consider a sequence of integers\nof length nk written on a circle and containing n zeros, n ones, n twos,..., n copies of (k \u2212 1).\nWe call such a sequence possible periodic if for any i = 0, 1, ..., k \u2212 2 in between any two\nconsecutive (on the circle) copies of i the sequence contains exactly one copy of i + 1. Now\nwe can ask:\nQuestion. What possible periodic sequences can occur as the sequences of zeros of f and\nits higher derivatives of order up to k \u2212 1 where f is a trigonometric polynomial of degree n\nwith all real and distinct zeros? (Here as before the integer i substitutes a real root of the\ni-th derivative of f .)\nUnfortunately, at the moment there is no nontrivial information available about the latter\nproblem.\nAcknowledments.
