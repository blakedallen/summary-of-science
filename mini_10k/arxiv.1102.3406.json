In this paper we investigate the relationship between the mixing times of the Glauber dynamics of a statistical mechanical system with its thermodynamic equilibrium structure. For this we\nconsider the mean-field Blume-Capel model, one of the simplest statistical mechanical models that exhibits the following intricate phase transition structure: within a two dimensional parameter space there\nexists a curve at which the model undergoes a second-order, continuous phase transition, a curve where\nthe model undergoes a first-order, discontinuous phase transition, and a tricritical point which separates\nthe two curves. We determine the interface between the regions of slow and rapid mixing. In order\nto completely determine the region of rapid mixing, we employ a novel extension of the path coupling\nmethod, successfully proving rapid mixing even in the absence of contraction between neighboring states.\n\n1. Introduction\nThe notion of mixing times is fundamental in the study of stochastic processes and their applications.\nIn addition to its purely theoretical value, mixing times are widely used in computational and physical\nsciences. In computer science, mixing times represent running times for randomized algorithms such as\nMetropolis-Hastings that are responsible for providing high accuracy solutions to a large class of problems\nwhere classical algorithms have impractical running times. In physics, one important use of mixing times\nis to determine the feasibility of simulating statistical mechanical systems via so called Glauber dynamics.\nAn important question of mixing times for statistical mechanical models is its relationship with the\nthermodynamic phase transition structure of the system. More specifically, as a system undergoes an\nequilibrium phase transition with respect to some parameter; e.g. temperature, how does the corresponding mixing times behave? This question has been well studied with recent rigorous results for one class\nof statistical mechanical models, namely those that undergo second-order, continuous phase transitions\nlike the famous Ising model [16] [15] [9]. For these models, it has been shown that the mixing times\nundergo a transition at precisely the thermodynamic phase transition point. However, for models that\nexhibit the other type of phase transition: first-order, discontinuous; e.g. Potts model with q > 2 [17], [8]\nand the Blume-Capel model [1], [2], [5]-[7], [14] with weak interaction, as far as well know, this question\nhas not been previously addressed. In this paper, we prove that the mixing time transition does not\ncoincide with the thermodynamic equilibrium phase transition for a model that exhibits a first-order,\ndiscontinuous phase transition.\nFirst-order, discontinuous phase transitions are more intricate than their counterparts, which makes\nrigorous analysis of these models traditionally more difficult. Furthermore, the more complex phase\ntransition structure causes the models to fall outside the scope of standard mixing time techniques\nincluding the so-called 'path coupling' method [3]. The path coupling argument is a powerful tool used\nto prove rapid mixing for various Markov chains, including the Glauber dynamics for statistical mechanical\nDate: November 3, 2018.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification.

However, due to the intricacy of a firstorder, discontinuous phase transition, the standard path coupling argument can not be applied in all\ncases because contraction between couplings of all neighboring states does not exist.\nIn this paper we prove the mixing time rates for the mean-field Blume-Capel (BC) model [1], [2], [5][7], a statistical mechanical spin model ideally suited for the analysis of the relationship between the\nthermodynamic equilibrium behavior and mixing times due to its intricate phase transition structure.\nSpecifically, the phase diagram of the BC model includes a curve at which the model undergoes a secondorder, continuous phase transition, a curve where the model undergoes a first-order, discontinuous phase\ntransition, and a tricritical point which separates the two curves.\nAs mentioned above, in a subset of the first-order, discontinuous phase transition region of the BC model,\nthe standard path coupling method does not apply as it does throughout the second-order, continuous\nphase transition region. Therefore, we apply an innovative new method we call aggregate path coupling\nin order to prove rapid mixing for the BC model in the entire first-order, discontinuous phase transition\nregion. While the standard path coupling method assumes contraction between every pair of states, our\nextended approach loosens this condition and requires contraction for only certain pairs of states. This\nnew method is not restricted to only the BC model and can be applied to other statistical mechanical\nmodels that undergo a first-order, discontinuous phase transition and moreover is general enough to be\na new tool in the theory of mixing times.\nThe paper is organized as follows. The mean-field Blume-Capel model is introduced in Section 2. There\nwe describe the equilibrium phase transition structure of the model and state the large deviation principle\nof the magnetization. In Section 3, we define the Glauber dynamics for the BC model and the notion\nof mixing times of Markov chains. In Section 4, we introduce the path coupling for the BC model and\nprove the form of the mean coupling distance. In Section 5, we use the standard path coupling to prove\nrapid mixing in the single phase region where the BC model undergoes a second-order, continuous phase\ntransition. In Section 6, we modify the path coupling argument to prove rapid mixing in the region where\nthe BC model undergoes a first-order, discontinuous phase transition. The slow mixing results are stated\nand proved in Section 7.\n\n2. Mean-field Blume-Capel model\nStatistical mechanical models are defined in terms of the Hamiltonian function. For the mean-field\nBlume-Capel model, the Hamiltonian function on the configuration space \u03a9n = {\u22121, 0, 1}n is defined by\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f62\nn\nn\nX\nX\nK\n\uf8ed\n\u03c9j \uf8f8\nHn,K (\u03c9) =\n\u03c9j2 \u2212\nn\nj=1\nj=1\nfor configurations \u03c9 = (\u03c91 , . . . , \u03c9n ). Here K represents the interaction strength of the model. Then\nfor inverse temperature \u03b2, the mean-field Blume-Capel model is defined by the sequence of probability\nmeasures\n1\nPn,\u03b2,K (\u03c9) =\nexp [\u2212\u03b2Hn,K (\u03c9)]\nZn (\u03b2, K)\nP\nwhere Zn (\u03b2, K) = \u03c9\u2208\u03a9n exp[\u2212\u03b2Hn,K (\u03c9)] is the normalizing constant called the partition function.\nIn [14], using large deviations theory [11], the authors proved the phase transition structure of the BC\nmodel. The analysis of the Pn,\u03b2,K was facilitated by expressing it in the form of a Curie-Weiss (mean-field\nIsing)-type model. This is done by absorbing the noninteracting component of the Hamiltonian into the\n\n\fMIXING TIMES FOR THE MEAN-FIELD BLUME-CAPEL MODEL VIA AGGREGATE PATH COUPLING\n\n3\n\nproduct measure Pn that assigns the probability 3\u2212n to each \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9n , obtaining\n\"\n\u0012\n\u00132 #\n1\nSn (\u03c9)\n(1)\nPn,\u03b2,K (d\u03c9) =\n* exp n\u03b2K\nPn,\u03b2 (d\u03c9)\nn\nZ\u0303n (\u03b2, K)\nPn\nIn this formula Sn (\u03c9) equals the total spin j=1 \u03c9j , Pn,\u03b2 is the product measure on \u03a9n with identical\none-dimensional marginals\n(2)\n\n\u03c1\u03b2 (d\u03c9j ) =\n\nZ(\u03b2) is the normalizing constant\nconstant [Z(\u03b2)]n /Zn (\u03b2, K).\n\nR\n\u039b\n\n1\n* exp(\u2212\u03b2\u03c9j2 ) \u03c1(d\u03c9j ),\nZ(\u03b2)\n\nexp(\u2212\u03b2\u03c9j2 )\u03c1(d\u03c9j ) = 1 + 2e\u2212\u03b2 , and Z\u0303n (\u03b2, K) is the normalizing\n\nAlthough Pn,\u03b2,K has the form of a Curie-Weiss (mean-field Ising) model when rewritten as in (1), it\nis much more complicated because of the \u03b2-dependent product measure Pn,\u03b2 and the presence of the\nparameter K. These complications introduce new features to the BC model described above that are not\npresent in the Curie-Weiss model [10].\nThe starting point of the analysis of the phase-transition structure of the BC model is the large deviation\nprinciple (LDP) satisfied by the spin per site or magnetization Sn /n with respect to Pn,\u03b2,K . In order to\nstate the form of the rate function, we introduce the cumulant generating function c\u03b2 of the measure \u03c1\u03b2\ndefined in (2); for t \u2208 R this function is defined by\n\u0015\n\u0014\nZ\n1 + e\u2212\u03b2 (et + e\u2212t )\nc\u03b2 (t) = log\nexp(t\u03c91 ) \u03c1\u03b2 (d\u03c91 ) = log\n1 + 2e\u2212\u03b2\n\u039b\nWe also introduce the Legendre-Fenchel transform of c\u03b2 , which is defined for z \u2208 [\u22121, 1] by\nJ\u03b2 (z) = sup{tz \u2212 c\u03b2 (t)}\nt\u2208R\n\nand is finite for z \u2208 [\u22121, 1]. J\u03b2 is the rate function in Cram\u00e9r's theorem, which is the LDP for Sn /n with\nrespect to the product measures Pn,\u03b2 [10, Thm. II.4.1] and is one of the components of the proof of the\nLDP for Sn /n with respect to the BC model Pn,\u03b2,K . This LDP stated in the next theorem is proved in\nTheorem 3.3 in [14].\nTheorem 2.1. For all \u03b2 > 0 and K > 0, with respect to Pn,\u03b2,K , Sn /n satisfies the LDP on [\u22121, 1] with\nexponential speed n and rate function\nI\u03b2,K (z) = J\u03b2 (z) \u2212 \u03b2Kz 2 \u2212 inf {J\u03b2 (y) \u2212 \u03b2Ky 2 }.\ny\u2208R\n\nIn other words, for any closed subset F ,\n(3)\n\nlim sup\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n1\nlog Pn,\u03b2,K {Sn /n \u2208 F } \u2264 \u2212I\u03b2,K (F )\nn\n\nand for any open subset G,\n(4)\n\nlim inf\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n1\nlog Pn,\u03b2,K {Sn /n \u2208 G} \u2265 \u2212I\u03b2,K (G)\nn\n\nwhere I\u03b2,K (A) = inf z\u2208A I\u03b2,K (z).\nThe LDP in the above theorem implies that those z \u2208 [\u22121, 1] satisfying I\u03b2,K (z) > 0 have an exponentially\nsmall probability of being observed as n \u2192 \u221e. Hence we define the set of equilibrium macrostates by\n\u1ebc\u03b2,K = {z \u2208 [\u22121, 1] : I\u03b2,K (z) = 0}.\n\n\f4\n\nYEVGENIY KOVCHEGOV, PETER T.

The calculation of the zeroes\nof I\u03b2,K - equivalently, the global minimum points of J\u03b2,K (z) \u2212 \u03b2Kz 2 - is greatly facilitated by the\nfollowing observations made in Proposition 3.4 in [14]:\n(1) The global minimum points of J\u03b2,K (z) \u2212 \u03b2Kz 2 coincide with the global minimum points of G\u03b2,K ,\nwhich are much easier to calculate.\n(2) The minimum values minz\u2208R {J\u03b2,K (z) \u2212 \u03b2Kz 2 } and minz\u2208R {G\u03b2,K (z)} coincide.\nItem 1 gives the alternate characterization that\n\u1ebc\u03b2,K = {z \u2208 [\u22121, 1] : z minimizes G\u03b2,K (z)}.\n\n(6)\n\nThe free energy functional G\u03b2,K exhibits two distinct behaviors depending on whether \u03b2 \u2264 \u03b2c = log 4 or\n\u03b2 > \u03b2c . In the first case, the behavior is similar to the Curie-Weiss (mean-field Ising) model. Specifically,\n(2)\n(2)\nthere exists a critical value Kc (\u03b2) defined in (7) such that for K < Kc (\u03b2), G\u03b2,K has a single minimum\n(2)\npoint at z = 0. At the critical value K = Kc (\u03b2), G\u03b2,K develops symmetric non-zero minimum points\nand a local maximum point at z = 0. This behavior corresponds to a continuous, second-order phase\ntransition and is illustrated in Figure 1.\n\n(2)\n\n(2)\n\n(2)\n\n\u039a > \u039ac ( \u03b2 )\n\n\u039a = \u039ac ( \u03b2 )\n\n\u039a < \u039ac ( \u03b2 )\n\n(2)\n\n\u039a >> \u039ac ( \u03b2)\n\nFigure 1. The free-energy functional G\u03b2,K for \u03b2 \u2264 \u03b2c\nOn the other hand, for \u03b2 > \u03b2c , G\u03b2,K undergoes two transitions at the values denoted by K1 (\u03b2) and\n(1)\nKc (\u03b2). For K < K1 (\u03b2), G\u03b2,K again possesses a single minimum point at z = 0. At the first critical\nvalue K1 (\u03b2), G\u03b2,K develops symmetric non-zero local minimum points in addition to the global minimum\npoint at z = 0. These local minimum points are referred to as metastable states and we refer to K1 (\u03b2)\nas the metastable critical value.

Glauber Dynamics and Mixing Times\nThe Markov chain for statistical mechanical models studied in this paper is called the Glauber dynamics, one of the most commonly used physical dynamics for these models. See [4] for more on Glauber\ndynamics. For the BC model, the Glauber dynamics evolve by selecting a vertex i at random and updating the spin at i according to the distribution Pn,\u03b2,K , conditioned to agree with the spins at all vertices\nnot equal to i. If the current configuration is \u03c9 and vertex i is selected, then the chance of the spin at i\nis updated to +1 is equal to\n(8)\n\np+1 (\u03c9, i) :=\n\ne2\u03b2K S\u0303(\u03c9,i)/n\ne2\u03b2K S\u0303(\u03c9,i)/n + e\u03b2\u2212(\u03b2K)/n + e\u22122\u03b2K S\u0303(\u03c9,i)/n\n\nP\n\nwhere S\u0303(\u03c9, i) = j6=i \u03c9j is the total spin of the neighboring vertices of i. Similarly, the probabilities of i\nupdating to 0 and \u22121 are\n(9)\n\np0 (\u03c9, i) =\n\ne\u03b2\u2212(\u03b2K)/n\ne2\u03b2K S\u0303(\u03c9,i)/n + e\u03b2\u2212(\u03b2K)/n + e\u22122\u03b2K S\u0303(\u03c9,i)/n\n\nand\n(10)\n\np\u22121 (\u03c9, i) =\n\ne\u22122\u03b2K S\u0303(\u03c9,i)/n\ne2\u03b2K S\u0303(\u03c9,i)/n + e\u03b2\u2212(\u03b2K)/n + e\u22122\u03b2K S\u0303(\u03c9,i)/n\n\np+1 (\u03c9, i) is increasing with respect to S\u0303(\u03c9, i), p\u22121 (\u03c9, i) is decreasing with respect to S\u0303(\u03c9, i), and p0 (\u03c9, i)\nis decreasing for S\u0303(\u03c9, i) > 0 and increasing for S\u0303(\u03c9, i) < 0.\nThe mixing time is a measure of the convergence rate of a Markov chain to its stationary distribution\nand is defined in terms of the total variation distance between two distributions \u03bc and \u03bd defined by\n1X\nk\u03bc \u2212 \u03bdkT V = sup |\u03bc(A) \u2212 \u03bd(A)| =\n|\u03bc(x) \u2212 \u03bd(x)|\n2\nA\u2282\u03a9\nx\u2208\u03a9\n\nGiven the convergence of the Markov chain, we define the maximal distance to stationary to be\nd(t) = max kP t (x, *) \u2212 \u03c0kT V\nx\u2208\u03a9\n\nt\n\nwhere P (x, *) is the transition probability of the Markov chain starting in configuration x and \u03c0 is its\nstationary distribution. Then, given \u03b5 > 0, the mixing time of the Markov chain is defined by\ntmix (\u03b5) = min{t : d(t) \u2264 \u03b5}\nIn general, rigorous analysis of mixing times is very difficult and the proof of exact mixing time asymptotics of even some basic chains remain elusive. See [16] for a detailed survey on the theory of mixing\ntimes.\nRates of mixing times are generally categorized into two groups: rapid mixing which implies the mixing\ntime exhibits polynomial growth with respect to the system size, and slow mixing which implies that\nthe mixing time grows exponentially with the system size. Determining where a model undergoes rapid\nmixing is of major importance, as it is in this region that the application of the dynamics is physically\nfeasible.\n\n\f8\n\nYEVGENIY KOVCHEGOV, PETER T. OTTO, AND MATHEW TITUS\n\nA classical tool in proving rapid mixing for Markov chains defined on graphs, including the Glauber\ndynamics of statistical mechanical models, is the path coupling technique [3]. It will be shown that this\ntechnique can be directly applied for the BC model in the second-order, continuous phase transition region\nbut fails in a subset of the first-order, discontinuous phase transition region. For the latter region, we\ndevelop an extension of the path coupling method we call aggregate path coupling to prove rapid mixing.\nThe path coupling method for the BC model is introduced in the next section.\n\n4. Path Coupling\nWe begin by setting up the path coupling for the Glauber dynamics of the mean-field Blume-Capel\nmodel. Define the path metric \u03c1 on \u03a9n = {\u22121, 0, 1}n by\n(11)\n\n\u03c1(\u03c3, \u03c4 ) =\n\nn\nX\n\n1{\u03c3j 6= \u03c4j },\n\nj=1\n\nthe number of sites at which the configurations \u03c3 and \u03c4 differ.\nLet \u03c3 and \u03c4 be two configurations with \u03c1(\u03c3, \u03c4 ) = 1; i.e. \u03c3 and \u03c4 are neighboring configurations. The\nspins of \u03c3 and \u03c4 agree everywhere except at a single vertex i. Assume that \u03c3i < \u03c4i . We next describe the\npath coupling (X, Y ) of one step of the Glauber dynamics starting in configuration \u03c3 with one starting in\nconfiguration \u03c4 . Pick a vertex k uniformly at random. We use a single random variable as the common\nsource of noise to update both chains, so the two chains agree as often as possible. In particular, let U\nbe a uniform random variable on [0, 1] and set\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 \u22121 if 0 \u2264 U \u2264 p\u22121 (\u03c3, k)\n0 if p\u22121 (\u03c3, k) < U \u2264 p\u22121 (\u03c3, k) + p0 (\u03c3, k)\nX(k) =\n\uf8f3\n+1 if p\u22121 (\u03c3, k) + p0 (\u03c3, k) < U \u2264 1\nand\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 \u22121 if 0 \u2264 U \u2264 p\u22121 (\u03c4, k)\n0 if p\u22121 (\u03c4, k) < U \u2264 p\u22121 (\u03c4, k) + p0 (\u03c4, k)\nY (k) =\n\uf8f3\n+1 if p\u22121 (\u03c4, k) + p0 (\u03c4, k) < U \u2264 1\nSet X(j) = \u03c3j and Y (j) = \u03c4j for j 6= k.\nSince \u03c3i < \u03c4i , for all j 6= i, S\u0303(\u03c3, j) < S\u0303(\u03c4, j) and thus\np+1 (\u03c4, k) > p+1 (\u03c3, k)\nThe path metric \u03c1 on the coupling above\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 0 if\n1 if\n\u03c1(X, Y ) =\n\uf8f3\n2 if\n\nand p\u22121 (\u03c4, k) < p\u22121 (\u03c3, k)\n\ntakes on the following possible values.\nk=i\nk 6= i and both chains updates the same\nk 6= i and the chains update differently\n\nThe application of the path coupling technique to prove rapid mixing is dependent on whether the mean\ncoupling distance with respect to the path metric \u03c1, denoted by E\u03c3,\u03c4 [\u03c1(X, Y )], contracts over all pairs of\nneighboring configurations.\nIn the lemma below and following corollary, we derive a working form for the mean coupling distance.\n\n\fMIXING TIMES FOR THE MEAN-FIELD BLUME-CAPEL MODEL VIA AGGREGATE PATH COUPLING\n\n9\n\nLemma 4.1.

Therefore, by (13), the\n(2)\n\nmean coupling distance contracts between all pairs of neighboring states whenever K < Kc (\u03b2).\nBy contrast, for \u03b2 > \u03b2c , we will show that rapid mixing occurs whenever K < K1 (\u03b2) where K1 (\u03b2) is the\nmetastable critical value introduced in Section 2 and depicted in Figure 2. However, since the supremum\nsup[\u22121,1] c00\u03b2 (x) > 2\u03b2K11 (\u03b2) , having K < K1 (\u03b2) is not sufficient for (13) to hold. That is, K < K1 (\u03b2)\ndoes not imply the contraction of the mean coupling distance between all pairs of neighboring states.\nRegardless, we will prove rapid mixing for all K < K1 (\u03b2) in Section 6 using an extension to the path\ncoupling method that we refer to as aggregate path coupling.\nWe now prove the mixing times for the mean-field Blume-Capel model, which varies depending on the\nparameter values (\u03b2, K) and their position with respect to the thermodynamic phase transition curves.\n5. Rapid Mixing for Continuous Phase Transition Region\nWe begin by stating the standard path coupling argument used to prove rapid mixing for the meanfield Blume-Capel model in the continuous, second-order phase transition region. The result is proved in\nCorollary 14.7 of [16].\nTheorem 5.1. Suppose the state space \u03a9 of a Markov chain is the vertex set of a graph with path metric\n\u03c1. Suppose that for each edge {\u03c3, \u03c4 } there exists a coupling (X, Y ) of the distributions P (\u03c3, *) and P (\u03c4, *)\nsuch that\nE\u03c3,\u03c4 [\u03c1(X, Y )] \u2264 \u03c1(\u03c3, \u03c4 )e\u2212\u03b1 for some \u03b1 > 0\nThen\n\u0019\n\u0018\n\u2212 log(\u03b5) + log(diam(\u03a9))\ntmix (\u03b5) \u2264\n\u03b1\n\n\fMIXING TIMES FOR THE MEAN-FIELD BLUME-CAPEL MODEL VIA AGGREGATE PATH COUPLING\n\n11\n\nKc(2)(\u03b2)\n\n\u03b2 > \u03b2c\n\n_ \u03b2c\n\u03b2<\n\nFigure 4. Behavior of c0\u03b2 (w) for large and small \u03b2.\nIn this section, we assume \u03b2 \u2264 \u03b2c which implies that the BC model undergoes a continuous, second-order\n(2)\nphase transition at K = Kc (\u03b2) defined in (7). By Theorem 4.3, for \u03b2 \u2264 \u03b2c , c0\u03b2 (x) is concave for x > 0.\nSee the first graph of Figure 4 as reference. We next state and prove the rapid mixing result for the\nmean-field Blume-Capel model in the second-order, continuous phase transition regime.\nTheorem 5.2. Let tmix (\u03b5) be the mixing time for the Glauber dynamics of the mean-field Blume-Capel\n(2)\nmodel on n vertices and Kc (\u03b2) be the continuous phase transition curve defined in (7). Then for\n(2)\n\u03b2 \u2264 \u03b2c = log 4 and K < Kc (\u03b2),\nn\ntmix (\u03b5) \u2264 (log n + log(1/\u03b5))\n\u03b1\n\u0010\n\u0011\nKc(2) \u2212K\nfor any \u03b1 \u2208 0,\nand n large enough.\n(2)\nKc\n\nProof.

Rapid Mixing for Discontinuous Phase Transition Region\nHere we consider the region \u03b2 > \u03b2c , where the mean-field Blume-Capel model undergoes a first-order\ndiscontinuous phase transition. In this region, the function c0\u03b2 (x) which determines whether the mean\ncoupling distance contracts (Corollary 4.2) is no longer strictly concave for x > 0 (Theorem 4.3). See\nthe second graph in Figure 4 for reference. We will show that rapid mixing occurs whenever K < K1 (\u03b2)\nwhere K1 (\u03b2) is the metastable critical value defined in Section 2 and depicted in Figure 2.\nAs shown in Section 4, in order to apply the standard path coupling technique of Theorem 5.1, we\n1\n. However since\nneed the inequality (13) to hold for all values of Sn (\u03c3) and thus sup[\u22121,1] c00\u03b2 (x) < 2\u03b2K\n1\n00\nsup[\u22121,1] c\u03b2 (x) > 2\u03b2K1 (\u03b2) , the condition K < K1 (\u03b2) is not sufficient for the contraction of the mean\ncoupling distance between all pairs of neighboring states which is required to prove rapid mixing using\nthe standard path coupling technique stated in Theorem 5.1.\nIn order to prove rapid mixing in the region where \u03b2 > \u03b2c and K < K1 (\u03b2), we take advantage of the\nresult in Theorem 2.4 which states the weak convergence of the magnetization Sn /n to a point-mass\nat the origin. Thus, in the coupling of the dynamics, the magnetization of the process that starts at\nequilibrium will stay mainly near the origin. As a result, for two starting configurations \u03c3 and \u03c4 , one\nof which has near-zero magnetization (Sn (\u03c3)/n \u2248 0), the mean coupling distance of a coupling starting\nin these configurations will be the aggregate of the mean coupling distances between neighboring states\nalong a minimal path connecting the two configurations. Although not all pairs of neighbors in the path\nwill contract, we show that in the aggregate, contraction between the two configurations still holds.\nIn the next lemma we prove contraction of the mean coupling distance in the aggregate and then the\nrapid mixing result for the mean-field Blume-Capel model is proved in the theorem following the lemma\nby applying the new aggregate path coupling method.\nLemma 6.1. Let (X, Y ) be a coupling of the Glauber dynamics of the BC model that begin in configurations \u03c3 and \u03c4 , not necessarily neighbors\u0010with respect\u0011 to the path metric \u03c1 defined in (11).

As shown in the figure, in the secondorder, continuous phase transition region (\u03b2 \u2264 \u03b2c ) for the BC model, the mixing time transition coincides\nwith the equilibrium phase transition. This is consistent with other models that exhibit this type of phase\ntransition. On the other hand, this is not the case in the first-order, discontinuous phase transition region\n(\u03b2 > \u03b2c ) where the mixing time transition occurs below the equilibrium phase transition.\n\n\f16\n\nYEVGENIY KOVCHEGOV, PETER T.
