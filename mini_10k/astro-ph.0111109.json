By tracing these\nchemical signatures back through the stellar populations of the Galaxy, it is possible to unravel its nucleosynthetic history and even to study stars which are\nnow extinct. This review considers recent applications of \"stellar genetics\" to\nexamine the earliest episodes of nucleosynthesis in the Universe, in Population\nIII stars and the Big Bang.\n\nKeywords: stars: abundances, stars: Population II, Galaxy: abundances, Galaxy:\nformation, Galaxy: halo\n\n1\n\nStellar genetics\n\nNucleosynthesis in the first few minutes following the Big Bang produced five isotopes\nin significant quantities: 1 H, 2 H, 3 He, 4 He, and 7 Li. The last of these accounts for less\nthan one part per billion. All other elements were produced later, either in stars or as\na consequence of stellar evolution.\nStellar nucleosynthesis theory predicts the yields of a wide range of isotopes, but\nin most astronomical spectra only elemental (rather than isotopic) abundances can\nbe measured because the wavelength shift between different isotopes of an element is\nusually well below the intrinsic line width set by thermal and pressure broadening.\nAmongst the few exceptions are 1 H and 2 H (e.g. Linsky et al. 1995; Burles, Kirkman,\n& Tytler 1999), and 6 Li and 7 Li (Smith, Lambert & Nissen 1993), whose isotope shifts\nare particularly large because of their small atomic masses. Isotope shifts are usually\nInvited Talk, Annual Conference of the Astronomical Society of Australia, Lorne, 2-4 July 2001\nSubmitted to Publ. Astron. Soc. Australia, 10 September 2001; in final form 29 October 2001.\nAccepted 2 November 2001\n\u2217\n\n1\n\n\flarger for molecular features, and 12 C and 13 C (e.g. Brown & Wallerstein 1989) and\ncertain Mg isotopes (e.g. Shetrone 1996) can be distinguished in CH and MgH bands.\nAlthough isotope shifts become even smaller for higher atomic masses, differences in\nthe hyperfine structure of odd and even isotopes may allow constraints to be placed on\nisotope ratios for some elements as heavy as Ba (Magain 1995) and Eu (Hauge 1972).\nNevertheless, stellar spectral measurements are generally limited to elemental rather\nthan isotopic abundances.\nBy measuring the time-evolution of abundances coming from a variety of nucleosynthesis sites - see Figure 1 - such as AGB stars, the cores of supernovae, and\nvarious radial zones in the envelopes of massive stars, it is possible to discover the roles\nof a wide range of stars over the history of the Galaxy. This is the activity I have\nbranded \"stellar genetics\": using the isotopic and elemental signatures that are passed\nfrom one stellar generation to the next to trace the particular nucleosynthesis reactions\nthat have occurred in the past, and hence also to trace the sites of those reactions even\nwhen these may no longer exist. For example, low-metallicity asymptotic giant branch\n(AGB) stars have all now become white dwarfs, but it is nevertheless possible to study\nthe internal structure of those AGB stars via the material they have dumped onto the\nsurface of longer-lived companions (Ryan et al. 2001a).\n\nFigure 1: Isotopic abundances arranged by atomic-mass number A. The legend indicates the main nucleosynthesis pathway for each species. (Based on data from Lang\n1980, Table 38).\nThe supernovae of massive stars are important early contributors to the enrichment\nof the Galaxy. Stars whose main-sequence mass exceeds 8-10 M\u2299 are expected to\nbecome core collapse (type II) supernovae on timescales < 50 Myr, as short as \u223c1 Myr\nfor stars of a few tens of solar masses. SN II produce of order ten times more oxygen\nthan iron (by mass), whereas SN Ia, with lower-mass progenitors and hence longer time\n2\n\n\flags, produce of order seven times more iron than oxygen (e.g. Timmes, Woosley &\nWeaver 1995). Consequently, the abundance ratios of oxygen and the \u03b1-elements1 to\niron are higher in Galactic halo stars than in the Sun (e.g. Tinsley 1979, Norris, Ryan\n& Beers 2001).\nAlthough supernovae have been widely modelled, the role of stellar winds in removing processed material from highly luminous stars has not yet been widely investigated\nfor the early enrichment of the halo, presumably because of uncertainties in the treatment of mass loss and its lower efficiency in metal-poor environments. However, the\nunexplained high levels of carbon enrichment in the early Galaxy, where perhaps 10%\nof stars have carbon-to-iron ratios up to 100 times solar (Norris, Ryan & Beers 1997a;\nBarbuy et al. 1997; Rossi, Beers & Sneden 1999) suggest that more attention should\nbe devoted to investigating this means of enriching the early interstellar medium. This\nis not to say that stellar winds are the only way of effecting large carbon excesses;\nindeed, the carbon-rich stars show a range of other signatures including s-process enhancements (Norris et al. 1997a), r-process enhancements (Cowan et al. 1995), and\nnormal neutron-capture-element abundances (Norris, Ryan & Beers 1997c, Aoki et al\n2002). Nevertheless, one may speculate that mass-loss may help produce high carbonto-iron ratios without producing neutron-capture elements if the ratio of black-hole\nremnants to neutron star remnants is greater in metal-poor than metal-rich populations, as it might be since metal-poor stars are more compact and hence sit deeper\nin their gravitational potential wells. This might manifest itself in a lowering of the\nprogenitor mass which corresponds to the division between (low-mass) neutron-star\nremnants and (high-mass) black-hole remnants in metal poor populations. (This uncertain value is sometimes set in the range 30-50 M\u2299 in Galactic chemical evolution\ncalculations; see also Prantzos (1994).) This would allow stellar winds to enrich the\ninterstellar medium in carbon, yet avoid an associated enrichment in iron due to fall\nback onto a neutron star.\nStars below the mass limit for SN II become AGB stars which are responsible\nfor most Galactic nucleosynthesis of carbon and s-process elements, but because of\ntheir lower masses they enrich the Galaxy after the first SN II. Models of 8\u201310 M\u2299\nsupernovae as the source of r-process nuclei suggest that these appeared as the Galaxy\nreached [Fe/H] \u2243 \u22123.0 (e.g. Mathews & Cowan 1990), which implies that AGB stars\nwill enrich the halo only once this metallicity has been reached. This makes AGB\nstars unsuitable as the source of the carbon excess in lower metallicity stars. Also,\nthe s-process contribution is insignificant until an even higher metallicity is reached,\nbecause of the need for pre-existing seed nuclei (Spite & Spite 1978; Truran 1981). The\nnumerical model of Travaglio et al. (1999) suggests that the s-process appears only at\n[Fe/H] \u2243 \u22121, though Pagel & Tautvai\u0161ien\u0117 (1997) argue for its appearance as low as\n[Fe/H] = \u22122.5.\nAlthough the science of stellar spectroscopy is more than a century old, many of the\noldest stars in the Galactic halo have been discovered only in the last decade, as a result\nof the Beers, Preston & Shectman (1985, 1992) survey and its successors (e.g. Norris,\n1\n\u03b1-elements are those relatively abundant light elements whose nuclei may be viewed as multiples\nof He nuclei, resulting either from He-burning or further fusion of He-burning products.\n\n3\n\n\fRyan & Beers 1998; Allende Prieto et al. 2000). Furthermore, detailed spectroscopic\nstudy of such stars requires \u00e9chelle spectrographs on 4\u201310 m-class telescopes equipped\nwith efficient electronic detectors. The remainder of this review highlights a number\nof issues concerning the very earliest stages of chemical evolution, namely Big Bang\nnucleosynthesis and the lack of identifiable Population III stars. Recent reviews of the\nevolution of other elements in the early phases of the Galaxy can be found in Ryan\n(2001) and Ryan et al. (2001b).\n\n2\n\nThe elusive Population III\n\nThe term \"Population III\" means different things to different people. For some it\nrefers to very metal-poor stars, whereupon the distinction between Pop III and Pop II\nbecomes blurred. More usefully it can be applied to the first generation of stars that\nformed from material enriched by Big Bang nucleosynthesis alone, prior to stellar\nnucleosynthesis occurring. This is the definition that will be adopted here. The massive\nstars of this first stellar generation were probably responsible for the re-ionization of\nthe universe, possibly at redshifts around z \u2243 10 (Tumlinson & Shull 2000), before the\nformation of Galactic halo stars at a redshift z \u2243 5 (e.g. Edmunds & Phillipps 1997).\nIt might be supposed that searches for extremely metal-poor stars should encounter\nsome having Population III composition, but none has been recognised. In fact, few\nwould ever have existed. Recall that a single 25 M\u2299 supernova is sufficient to enrich a 106 M\u2299 primordial gas cloud to [Fe/H] \u2243 \u22123.5 (Ryan, Norris & Bessell 1991),\ndemonstrating that very little stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis is required to significantly enrich the interstellar medium. Furthermore, such supernovae will appear on\ntimescales of only a few million years. Pop III stars will be a very minor constituent\nof the Galaxy.\nA more instructive question to ask is whether there is a lower limit on the metallicity\nof Pop II stars. The answer appears to be \"yes\". Despite the systematic surveys cited\nabove, no star more metal-deficient than CD\u221238\u25e6 245 (Bessell & Norris 1984) has been\ndiscovered, though a few of comparable metallicity have been found. Although a simple\nclosed-box model for galactic chemical evolution is a poor model for the Galactic disk, it\ndoes a surprisingly good job of fitting the Galactic halo (Hartwick 1976; Ryan & Norris\n1991a) and predicts a factor of ten fewer stars for each factor of ten lower metallicity.\nHowever, the good fit breaks down once [Fe/H] falls to \u22124, and a substantial deficit\nof stars becomes apparent. Based on current halo samples, the simple model suggests\nthat 11 stars with [Fe/H] < \u22124 should have been detected, whereas at most two are\nknown (Norris 1999). The Poisson probability of this occurring by chance is just 0.12%,\nstrongly suggesting the deficit is real.\nA number of potential explanations for the absence of the more metal poor stars\ncan be proposed:\n\u2022 The lowest metallicity (Pop III?) stars probably formed before the Galaxy had collapsed to the size of the halo, and hence the missing stars may have a greater radial\nscale than the halo.\n\u2022 The initial mass function (IMF) may have had a lower limit above 0.8 M\u2299 , so no\n4\n\n\fmain-sequence or red giant branch Pop III stars remain after \u223c15 Gyr (e.g. Nakamura\n& Umemura 1999).\n\u2022 Since the pre-main-sequence contraction time of 0.8 M\u2299 stars is \u223c 107 yr whereas\nthe first supernovae would have exploded after only \u223c 106 yr, some contamination of\nlow-mass Pop III stars may have occurred. However, since low-mass stars will have already contracted to the base of their Hayashi tracks and undergone deuterium burning\non a \u223c 106 yr timescale, it is less likely that contamination from a supernova would be\nvery effective.\n\u2022 Pop III stars may have accreted sufficient material on passages through the Galactic\ndisk that their thin outer convective zones are now contaminated by heavier elements\n(e.g. Yoshii 1981). However, such accretion could not hide Pop III giants, whose\ngreater convection would give them lower metallicities than dwarfs (which is not observed), and their heavy element abundance ratios would resemble those of the accreted\nmaterial, but halo abundance ratios are different from that of disk material (Ryan &\nNorris 1991b).\nSo, Pop III stars are undetected, but that does not mean we cannot study them.\nThanks to stellar genetics, the yields of the first Pop III supernovae are observable as\nthe post-primordial composition of Pop II stars. Comparisons of the abundances of\nextremely-metal-poor halo stars with the yields predicted for Pop III supernovae (e.g.\nWoosley & Weaver 1995) search for concordance in the abundance ratios, with the aim\nof revealing the mass, supernova-energy ranges, and possibly eventually the rotation\nof Pop III stars, thus identifying which types of stars have contributed to the early\nchemical enrichment of the Galaxy (e.g. Norris et al. 2001).\n\n3\n3.1\n\nPrimordial isotopes\n4\n\nHe\n\nMost Pop II stars are not hot enough to excite He spectral lines, and those that are\nshow the effects of diffusion which, in the absence of convective mixing, causes elements\nto stratify in the stellar atmosphere. To find the primordial 4 He composition, it is\nnecessary to measure H II regions in galaxies that are less chemically enriched than\nthe Milky Way. By measuring the strengths of emission lines of hydrogen, helium,\nand various metals (especially oxygen and nitrogen), it is possible to derive relative\nabundances (e.g. Pagel et al. 1992).\nThe evolution of the helium mass fraction Y with metallicity mass fraction Z is\nrevealed in a graph of Y vs Z, which gives a straight line graph of the form Y =\nYp + (dY /dZ)Z. The primordial helium abundance Yp is simply the intercept.\nChallenges in deriving the primordial helium mass fraction Yp include:\n\u2022 Helium production does not always accompany metal production at the same rate.\nThat is, dY /dZ is not the same for all objects. Wolf-Rayet stars enrich H II regions\nmore in He than the metals suggest, and bias Yp upwards. Fortunately, Wolf-Rayet\nstars have a spectral signature which allows the most troublesome cases to be detected\n(e.g Pagel et al. 1992), but some bias may remain at a low level.\n5\n\n\f\u2022 H II regions are visible only because the gas is excited by the UV thermal radiation\nfrom hot stars embedded in the clouds. The absorption lines in the stellar spectra literally undermine the emission line intensities, resulting in artificially weak He emission\nlines, from which low values of Yp would be derived (e.g. Olive & Skillman 2001).\n\u2022 It is often assumed that only UV thermal radiation from the hot stars ionises and\nexcites the nebula gas, but there may also be some excitation by collisions between gas\natoms or by re-absorption of the emitted radiation. The effect of ionisation correction\nfactors is unclear (Ballantyne, Ferland & Martin 2000; Viegas, Gruenwald, & Steigman\n2000).\nAn illustration of how these factors have influenced primordial He estimates is given\nin Figure 2. All values are close to Yp = 0.24, but since the mid-1990s two streams\nof values have been obtained: a \"low\" value near 0.230, and a \"high\" value near\n0.245. Moreover, the stated error bars are considerably smaller than this difference!\nThe impact of these different values on the derived baryon density of the universe is\ndiscussed later.\n\nFigure 2: Measurements of the primordial helium abundance, 1979\u20131998. Horizontal\npoints and bars give the inferred values, with references in the right-hand column.\n\n3.2\n\n3\n\nHe\n\n3\n\nHe is presently almost unusable as a diagnostic of Big Bang nucleosynthesis. In the\nsolar system, direct measurements of 3 He atoms in the solar wind and meteorites can\nbe made, but all of this material has passed through numerous stellar generations. The\n6\n\n\fonly other diagnostic is the 3.4 cm hyperfine transition of the 3 He II ion, analogous\nto the 21 cm hyperfine transition of 1 H I and the 92 cm hyperfine transition of 2 H I,\nwhich can be observed in H II regions and planetary nebulae.\nTo derive an abundance from the observations, an accurate model of the H II region\nor planetary nebula is needed. There is reason to doubt the suitability of current\nmodels, because different H II regions show a range of 3 He abundances that correlate\nwith the mass of the H II region, suggesting that the 3 He has been depleted locally\n(Rood et al. 1995).\nThere are also large uncertainties in the interpretation of 3 He abundances. Stars are\nexpected to both produce and destroy 3 He at different stages of their life. Until very\nrecently, the expectation was that 1\u20132 M\u2299 stars would be net producers of 3 He while\nmore massive stars would destroy it, but that the overall effect would be an increase\nin 3 He with metallicity. This was a problem, because it predicted much more 3 He than\nis observed. This may be resolved by recent developments in stellar evolution theory,\nthrough the proposal by Boothroyd & Sackmann (1999) and Sackmann & Boothroyd\n(1999) that mixing of material occurs deeper in stars than would be expected from\nstandard convective theory, and that this leads to destruction of 3 He even in the lower\nmass stars previously believed to be net 3 He producers, making stars overall destroyers\nof this primordial isotope.\nGiven these significant problems, 3 He currently does not constrain primordial nucleosynthesis strongly. Bania, Rood & Balser (2001) describe their measurement 3 He/H\n= (1.79\u00b10.65)\u00d710\u22125 as a \"reasonable approximation of the primordial value,\" while\nBell (2000) reached the contrasting conclusion that \"the upper limit for the relative\nabundance of primordial 3 He ... is 3 He+ /H+ \u2264 2 \u00d7 10\u22126 .\"\n\n3.3\n\n2\n\nH\n\nDeuterium is destroyed in stars, burning as d + p \u21923 He + \u03b3. As there is no net\nsource of deuterium in stars, its abundance has decreased steadily since the Big Bang,\nand any value measured today is a lower limit on the primordial value. Accurate\nmeasurements of the deuterium abundance can be made in solar system bodies and\nthe interstellar medium of our Galaxy. The interstellar \"D\u03b1\" line, which is displaced\nfrom the \"Lyman-\u03b1\" line of 1 H at 1216 \u00c5 by \u22120.33 \u00c5, gives D/H = 1.6\u00d710\u22125 , which\nis therefore a firm lower limit on the primordial value (Linsky et al. 1995). Models of\nthe chemical evolution of the Galaxy can be applied to estimate how much deuterium\nhas been destroyed over its lifetime, but this adds more uncertainty.\nMuch effort since the mid-1990's has gone into trying to measure deuterium in\nthe interstellar medium of other galaxies, particularly in damped Lyman-\u03b1 (DLA)\nabsorption systems superimposed on quasar spectra at high redshift. The look-back\ntimes of objects at high redshifts offer the opportunity of looking directly into the\npast, and making measurements of the deuterium content \"back then\". Such values\nare expected to be closer to the primordial one than values measured in the interstellar\nmedium of our own Galaxy.\nBecause the abundance of deuterium is so much lower than that of hydrogen, large\n7\n\n\fcolumn densities of hydrogen are required before deuterium can be detected. Damped\nLyman-\u03b1 clouds have high column densities and are believed to be early galactic gas.\nDebate continues as to their nature: are they collapsed into flattened disks as in a\nmature galaxy like the Milky Way, or still distended like the halo of the Galaxy? The\nrestriction to using high column-density clouds is the source of several difficulties in\nobtaining reliable D/H measurements at high redshift.\n\u2022 Firstly, there is confusion over whether any single absorption line is due to deuterium\nor to another hydrogen line at a slightly lower redshift (e.g. Burles et al. 1999).\n\u2022 Secondly, although it may be possible to measure the deuterium column density quite\nwell, we also need to know the hydrogen column density if we are to obtain the ratio\nD/H. However, since the Lyman-\u03b1 line is saturated (has absorbed all of the light), it\nis very difficult to measure its column density accurately. The H column density has\nto be obtained from other features in the spectrum.\nFigure 3 shows measurements towards a range of quasars over 1994-1999. A considerable range of values has been obtained, including \"low\" values around D/H =\n(2\u20135)\u00d710\u22125 , and \"high\" values around D/N = (15\u201330)\u00d710\u22125.\n\nFigure 3: Measurements of the deuterium abundance in quasar absorption line systems,\n1994\u20131999. (See Figure 2 for the layout.) The value measured in the interstellar\nmedium (ISM) of the Milky Way is shown at the bottom for comparison. Below the\nfigure are recorded the quasar names, the redshift of the measured absorption system\n(not the redshift of the quasar, zem ), and the metallicity Z on a logarithmic scale\nrelative to the Sun, where [Z/H] = log10 (Z/ZSun).\n8\n\n\fThe high and low values have very different implications. As any real measurement\nof deuterium sets a lower limit on the primordial abundance, if any of the \"high\"\nmeasurements is correct, then the primordial value must be (at least!) an order of\nmagnitude higher than that inferred from the Galactic ISM. However, the difficulty\nof knowing whether absorption just shortward of the damped Lyman-\u03b1 line is really\ndue to deuterium weakens the arguments for very high D/H ratios. \"Low\" values\nhave been measured in several systems, in particular the ones with low metallicity\n[Z/H] \u223c \u22123.0, \u22122.9, and \u22122.8. For the \"high\" values to be correct, deuterium would\nhave to be destroyed very quickly in the low metallicity systems despite their low\nmetallicities indicating very little stellar processing. This seems unlikely (Tosi et al.\n1998; Prantzos & Ishimaru 2001). It is more likely that the lowest metallicity systems\nare more reliable measurements, and that the \"high\" values are misleading due to the\npresence of additional 1 H absorption lines. Data are still being taken; it is perhaps a\nmatter of opinion whether the issue has been settled, but it is probable that the \"low\"\ndeuterium measurements will win out over the \"high\" ones once the dust settles. (See\nreferences to Figure 3.)\n\n3.4\n\n7\n\nLi\n\nLithium is measurable in the spectra of main-sequence halo dwarfs. 7 Li is much less\nfragile than 2 H, and as the outer layers of solar-mass metal-poor dwarfs do not mix\nto great depths, the surface Li in these stars is widely believed to be little changed\nsince they formed \u223c13 Gyr ago. The main evidence in support of this is empirical:\nmost solar-temperature, metal-poor dwarfs have almost the same Li abundance despite\nhaving different amounts of other elements and different masses (e.g. Spite & Spite\n1982). It is unlikely that all such stars could deplete or supplement their Big Bang Li\ncomplement and still end up with the same value after \u224314 Gyrs. Theoretical models\nof stars differ in the amount of Li they preserve, and it is just conceivable that some\nmechanisms of Li destruction might conspire to deplete all stars by the same amount.\nHowever, the observations can tolerate little Li depletion even over the long lifetimes\nof these stars. For processing by rotationally-induced mixing, Ryan, Norris, & Beers\n(1999) and Pinsonneault et al. (2001) infer limits < 0.1 and \u22430.2 dex respectively.\nThe difference in these values depends on (A) the frequency of the few stars with Li\nabundances significantly lower than the rest, (B) the size distribution of their deficiencies, and (C) whether the deviations are in fact due to the proposed mechanism\n(rotationally-induced mixing) and not some other. Small amounts of Li production\nmay also be present in the stars that formed more recently from nucleosynthetically\nenriched material. This can be tracked analogously to the way He production is tracked\nby dY /dZ. The main uncertainty remaining for Li is how accurately we know the temperatures of the stellar atmospheres, and therefore how well we can compute the Li\nabundances from their spectra. The estimate of the primordial Li abundance by Ryan\n\u221210\net al. (2000) is n(Li)/n(H) = 1.23+0.68\n.\n\u22120.32 \u00d7 10\nNote, however, that even though the primordial Li abundance may be reasonably\nwell known, there are several significant deficiencies in our understanding of Li pro9\n\n\fcessing in Pop II and Pop I stars. About 7% of Pop II stars which would be expected\nto have normal Li abundances show extensive (essentially complete) destruction of the\nelement. Investigations of other elements in these stars (Norris et al. 1997b; Ryan,\nNorris & Beers 1998) show heterogeneous behaviour and indicate that no single characteristic besides Li deficiency unites these stars. Ryan et al. (2001c) have suggested\nthey may be blue-stragglers-to-be, sub-turnoff-mass products of classical blue-straggler\nformation mechanisms. There is also an unexplained contrast between the highly uniform Li abundances measured in halo field stars (Ryan et al. 1999) and the large\nspread of measurements for subgiants in the halo globular cluster M92 (Boesgaard et\nal. 1998).\n\n3.5\n\nPutting it all together\n\nWe now put the observational constraints together and examine the concordance with\ntheory. The standard Big Bang model assumes a uniform density and predicts the\nyields of the primordial isotopes for different values of that density.2 The predicted\nyield of 4 He is close to 24% for a wide range of densities, and the fact that this is\nso close to the real universe is a remarkable accomplishment of the model. It is even\nmore remarkable that for 2 H and 7 Li the abundances are also in accord. For three\nisotopes spanning a range of 1 billion in abundance, the model is broadly in accord\nwith observations.\nFigure 4 presents the situation in more detail, and illustrates the different values of\nthe derived 4 He and 2 H abundances, and the 7 Li value. No 3 He observations are shown.\nThe predicted yield of Li is not monotonic with density, as a second nucleosynthesis\npathway becomes effective for \u03b7 > 2\u00d710\u221210 . The well-defined Li abundance is therefore\nconsistent with a wide range of density values. Two observational results are given for\neach of 4 He and 2 H, the \"high\" and \"low\" values discussed above. Corrections for\nsystematic errors in the 4 He analysis favour \"high\" values, and the study of more\ndamped Lyman-\u03b1 systems favour the \"lower\" range for D, giving a value for \u03b7 \u2243\n5 \u00d7 10\u221210 . (The slightly lower 95% confidence interval given by Ryan et al. (2000),\n\u03b7 = (1.7\u22123.9)\u00d710\u221210 , was based on a primordial 4 He abundance intermediate between\nthe two observational values shown here.)\nAn independent measurement of the universal baryon density is possible from the\npower spectrum of the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR). The higherorder fluctuations above the main (\u2243 1\u25e6 ) peak are influenced by the propagation of\nsound waves, which reflects the baryon density. Measurements published in 2000 giving\n\u03b7 = 10 \u00d7 10\u221210 raised the spectre of incompatible Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) and\nCMBR measurements of the baryon density (Hogan 2000). Fortunately, the earlier\nvalues have been superseded with the addition of more data such that the CMBR\nmeasurements now suggest a 95% confidence interval \u03b7 = (3.4 \u2212 7.9) \u00d7 10\u221210 , which is\ncertainly compatible with the BBN values cited above (Netterfield et al. 2001).\n2\n\nThe density may be expressed variously as the baryon-to-photon ratio, \u03b7, or the baryon density\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u03b7\n\u00d7 ( 50 km sH0 Mpc )2 .\nas a fraction of the critical density, \u03a9B , where \u03a9B = 0.014 \u00d7 10\u221210\n\n10\n\n\fFor an assumed Hubble constant of 63 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 , the value \u03b7 = 5 \u00d7 10\u221210\ncorresponds to \u03a9B = 0.043. Not only is this well below the closure density, it is also\na factor of ten below the matter density \u03a9M \u2243 0.35 inferred from other cosmological\nstudies (Efstathiou et al. 1999), pointing to the continuing need for non-baryonic dark\nmatter.\n\nFigure 4: Solid curves: Calculations of yields of Big Bang nucleosynthesis for 4 He, 2 H,\nthe sum of 2 H and 3 He, and 7 Li, for different assumed baryon-to-photon ratios.
