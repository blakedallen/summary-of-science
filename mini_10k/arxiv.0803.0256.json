Through comparison with models, we find that the\nlate-time light curve of SN 1994I is consistent with that of spherically symmetric\nejecta in homologous expansion, for which the ability to trap the \u03b3-rays produced by the radioactive decay of 56 Co diminishes roughly as the inverse of time\nsquared. We also find that by the time of the HST photometry, the light curve\nwas significantly energized by the annihilation of positrons.\nSubject headings: Supernovae\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nLate-time light curves are an important piece of evidence for understanding supernova\n(SN) explosions. Conditioned by the always diminishing optical depth in the ejecta a time\nis always reached when the energy from radioactive decay is radiated on a time scale short\ncompared with the dynamical time scale. Radiative equilibrium is established and there is a\nsimple connection between energy produced, trapped, and radiated. The simplified physics\npermits a fairly direct connection between the light curve and the dynamical evolution\nof the expanding ejecta. This gives a more robust handle on some of the basic physical\nparameters of the explosion. How fast these late times are reached depend on the mass to\nenergy ratio of the ejecta. For supernovae (SNe) without massive H envelopes they start a\nfew weeks after maximum light.\nThe main physical processes at play are the emission of \u03b3-rays and positrons from\nradioactive decays in the\n\n56\n\nNi \u2192\n\n56\n\nCo \u2192\n\n56\n\nFe chain (Colgate & McKee 1969),\n\ntheir interaction with the ejecta, and the spectrum of the radiation produced by the\nthermalization processes and the radiative transfer in the expanding ejecta. Some knowledge\nof the spectrum is important because ideal bolometric light curves are seldom observed,\nand astrophysicists generally must deal with observations that cover only a fraction of\nthe radiated energy. The decay of\n\n56\n\nNi into\n\n56\n\nCo releases energy in the form of \u03b3-rays,\n\nwith an e-folding time of 8.8 d, while the decay of\n\n56\n\nCo into\n\n56\n\nFe releases \u223c 96% of the\n\nenergy in \u03b3-rays and the remaining \u223c 4% as positrons, with an e-folding time of 111.3 d\n(Diehl & Timmes 1998). Given a density structure and a chemical composition for the\nexpanding ejecta, the \u03b3-ray transport problem is determined. Positron interaction with the\nejecta, on the other hand, strongly depends on the presence, and geometry, of magnetic\nfields (Ruiz-Lapuente & Spruit 1998). These are, and will probably remain, essentially free\nparameters. The escape of positrons from Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) may be relevant\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nto the diffuse 511 keV positron annihilation radiation from the Galactic bulge region\n(Kn\u00f6dlseder et al. 2005).\nAmong SNe that explode through the gravitational collapse of the core, there are two\ndistinct scenarios. For SNe II (see Filippenko 1997, for a review of SN types), associated\nwith explosions of massive stars that have retained most of their H /He envelopes, and\nwhich are endowed with a relatively large mass-to-energy ratio, the ejecta are able first\nto trap the UV and optical-near IR photons for \u223c100 days, and then to trap the \u03b3-rays\nfrom radioactive decays very efficiently for hundreds of days (e.g. Clocchiatti et al. 1996a;\nElmhamdi et al. 2003). Since they trap essentially all of the energy from the radioactive\ndecay of\n\n56\n\nCo during the time when both \u03b3-rays and positrons are being produced, their\n\nlight curves do not provide an effective diagnostic for the balance of \u03b3-ray versus positron\nenergy deposition. Something similar happens for many (though not necessarily all) Type Ib\nand Type IIb explosions.\nSNe of Type Ic, on the other hand, associated with the explosion of stars that were\nmassive while on the main sequence but that through individual and/or interactive binary\nevolution have lost all of the H and most of, if not all, the He of the outer layers,\npresent more favorable conditions to study this problem. Their ejecta have a mass, and/or\nmass-to-energy ratio, small enough to allow a major fraction of the \u03b3-rays from\n\n56\n\nCo to\n\nescape, potentially providing a cleaner window into the details of positron energy deposition.\nThe Type Ic SN 1994I in M51 presented a remarkable opportunity to build a useful\nlate-time light curve for ejecta having both a low mass and a low mass-to-energy ratio. It\nexploded in a nearby galaxy and thus reached a bright apparent magnitude at maximum.\nBeing in a host galaxy that is routinely observed by amateur astronomers meant, in addition,\nthat the SN was spotted, reported, and spectroscopically confirmed well before maximum\nlight (Puckett et al. 1994; Schmidt et al. 1994; Clocchiatti et al. 1994). Consequently, it\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nreceived extensive coverage both near maximum light and at later times.\nAn optical through near-infrared (IR) light curve extending \u223c50 d after maximum\nlight was prepared by Schmidt (1994), and a more extensive one, reaching \u223c120 d after\nmaximum, was presented by Richmond et al. (1996). The SN was, in addition, the target\nof many other programs, including radio and X-ray observations (Rupen et al. 1994a;\nImmler et al. 2002), and high-resolution spectroscopy of narrow absorption lines produced\nby significant amounts of foreground interstellar matter in M51 (Ho & Filippenko 1995).\nExtensive spectroscopic data sets were collected and presented by Filippenko et al. (1995)\nand Clocchiatti et al. (1996b). Finally, the light curve derived by Schmidt (1994) was\nthe subject of detailed theoretical studies to set constraints on the physical parameters of\nthe progenitor of SN 1994I and its evolutionary path to explosion (Nomoto et al. 1994;\nIwamoto et al. 1994; Woosley et al. 1995).\nIn this paper, we present Hubble Space Telescope (HST) multi-wavelength broadband\nobservations of SN 1994I, taken \u223c280 d after maximum light (\u223c300 days after explosive\nnucleosynthesis). Combining these observations with those of Richmond et al. (1996), we\nbuild an optical through near-IR light curve that, via detailed modeling, can be used to set\nconstraints on the ejected mass and its dynamical and thermal evolution. We introduce the\nnew observations and photometry in \u00a7 2. In \u00a7 3 we describe the problems that need to be\nsolved in order to combine the ground-based and space-borne observations, as well as the\nsteps we took to construct our optical through near-IR light curve, and in \u00a7 4 we present the\nresults. Our discussion in \u00a7 5 gives some physical interpretation based both on simplified\nmodels of the ejecta and \u03b3-ray radiative transfer, and presents a revision and extension of\nthe detailed model CO21 (Iwamoto et al. 1994). We summarize our conclusions in \u00a7 6.\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\n2.\n\nLate-Time Observations and Photometry\n\nThe late-time data on SN 1994I were obtained with HST under the Supernova\nINtensive Studies (SINS) General Observer Program. On 1995 Jan. 15 (UT dates are used\nthroughout this paper), about 280 d after maximum light, the WFPC2 on board HST\nwas used to take five images of the SN in optical and near-IR passbands, totaling 3200 s\nof exposure time. The pointing of the telescope placed the SN on the Planetary Camera\nchip. Table 1 gives additional details of the observations. The images were reduced using\nthe \"On-The-Fly Reprocessing\" pipeline, provided by the Space Telescope Science Institute\n(STScI).\nCareful inspection of the images revealed the SN at the expected position, amidst the\ncomplex structure of one of the inner arms of M51. The right ascension and declination\nprovided by the world coordinate system of the images was within 1\u2032\u2032 of the position found\nby high-resolution radio interferometry with the Very Large Array (Rupen et al. 1994b).\nThe identification was confirmed by analysis of two earlier sets of ultraviolet (UV) images\nalso obtained with HST. They were obtained with WFPC2, when the SN was close to\nmaximum light, using the F 336W passband. One image, with an exposure time of 180 s,\nwas taken on 1994 April 18, and a set of three images, with a combined exposure time of\n1200 s, was obtained on 1994 May 12. The object identified as SN 1994I appears with very\ngood signal in all images, and its flux diminishes by about a magnitude between the two\nepochs. A finder chart showing SN 1994I in the HST UV images is given in Figure 1, and\nstamps of the region around the SN in the UV, optical, and near-IR images are given in\nFigure 2.\nThe background against which the SN appeared is complex, but the exquisite resolution\nof PC1 placed the SN more than 15 pixels away from the closest source. The background\nlight in the immediate vicinity of the SN appears to be relatively flat. Point spread function\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\n(PSF) fitting photometry of the SN was done using HSTPhot (Dolphin 2000), which is\ncalibrated with the zero points of Holtzman et al. (1995) by normalizing the PSF magnitude\nto aperture photometry with a 0.5\u2032\u2032 radius. The adopted version of HSTPhot had zero\npoints and charge-transfer efficiency (CTE) correction parameters updated in 2002 October.\nThe HSTPhot photometry of SN 1994I is given in Table 1.\n\n3.\n\nMerging the Datasets and Estimating Extinction\n\nIf the late-time photometry of SN 1994I presented in the previous section is combined\nwith the ground-based photometry of Richmond et al. (1996), the result will be a multicolor\nlight curve extending from \u223c 9 d before to \u223c 280 d after maximum light. Very few\nSNe Ic have a multicolor light curve extending so long. Combining the datasets requires\ntransforming the broadband observations between the different photometric systems used,\nand applying a correction for interstellar extinction.\nThe ground based observations of Richmond et al. (1996) were taken with three\ndifferent combinations of instrument and telescopes but all of them referred to the standard\nsystem of Bessell (1990). We took the data from their Tables 4, 5, and 6, without making\ndistinctions between datasets obtained with different telescopes, and selecting the dates for\nwhich all the B, V , RC , and IC bands had been observed. When more than one datapoint\nexisted for the same day we combined them by a weighted average. This approach means\nthat systematic differences in the calibration of the SN photometry due to the slightly\ndifferent realizations of the standard system are interpreted as an uncertainty in the\nobservation. The selected photometry is given in Table 2.\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\n3.1.\n\nThe Spectral Shape Corrections\n\nMerging the space-borne and ground-based datasets calls for careful consideration of\nthe passbands used. The differences in the SN flux measured by two different realizations of\nthe same passband, evaluated in magnitudes, have been called \"spectral shape corrections,\"\nor S\u2013corrections (Stritzinger et al. 2002; Krisciunas et al. 2004; Pignata et al. 2004). We\ngeneralize here the use of this name to the difference between the flux measured by a\nground-based passband and its space-borne counterpart.\nComputing the S\u2013corrections requires precise knowledge of the passbands' throughput\nand, ideally, spectra of SN 1994I at the specific dates of the photometry. The spectroscopic\nevolution of SN 1994I was closely followed (Filippenko et al. 1995; Clocchiatti et al. 1996b),\nalthough the last spectrum available was taken only \u223c147 d after maximum light, more than\n130 d before the HST photometry. Regarding the passbands, those of the HST WFPC2 are\nwell characterized1 , but three slightly different realizations of the ground-based BV (RI)C\nsystem were used by Richmond et al. (1996). Hence, as a model for the ground-based\nsystem, we computed the S\u2013corrections as if the standard system were that of Bessell\n(1990), the one to which Richmond et al. (1996) attempted to transform. We estimated an\nuncertainty for these S\u2013corrections by using different realizations of the Bessell passbands\nat assorted optical/near-IR imagers at the Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory and the\nKitt Peak National Observatory. Note that we transformed the curves of Bessell (1990)\nfrom energy-based to photon-based units, and, for the other ground bassed passbands, we\nfactored in a typical CCD quantum efficiency, the spectral response of two aluminum-coated\nsurfaces, and the typical response of the sky telluric absorption bands if needed.\nWith this database of passbands and spectra, we explored whether it was better\n1\n\nSee the URL ftp://ftp.stsci.edu/cdbs maintained by the STScI.\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nto transform the photometry from the space-borne to the ground-based system, or\nvice-versa. We found that because spectra are available at the times of the ground-based\nobservations, it was preferable to convert the ground-based photometry to the space-based\nsystem. We computed S\u2013corrections for the ground-based photometry using the spectra\nof Filippenko et al. (1995) and Clocchiatti et al. (1996b), and passbands as described\nabove. We fit smooth polynomials to their time variation and used them to interpolate the\nS\u2013correction and its uncertainty for the Richmond et al. (1996) observations. The results\nare included in Table 2.\n\n3.2.\n\nInterstellar Extinction\n\nAll of the photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 1994I indicate that it was\nheavily reddened by interstellar matter in M51. Different approaches to estimating AV have\nincluded comparison with detailed theoretical models of light curves (Iwamoto et al. 1994)\nand spectra (Baron et al. 1996, 1999; Millard et al. 1999), and high-resolution spectroscopy\nof the narrow absorption lines produced by the gaseous phases of the interstellar matter\n(Ho & Filippenko 1995). Values of AV from 0.9 up to 3.1 have been inferred, with a\npreferred range roughly between 1 and 2. We follow Richmond et al. (1996) in adopting\nAV = 1.4 \u00b1 0.5 mag.\nThis value of AV must next be translated into extinction for the different broadband\nfilters. Typically an interstellar reddening law is adopted and scaled by the value of AV ,\nand the monochromatic fluxes obtained from the photometry are then corrected, applying\nthe extinction value that the adopted law prescribes for the effective wavelength of the\npassbands. This approach, however, may lead to systematic errors when applied to objects\nwith strong and variable emission lines. The effect is typically small, but it is systematic\nwith time, tending to change the overall shape, and/or slope, of a light curve. Since the\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nextinction affecting SN 1994I is large, the issue merits consideration.\nAgain, the series of spectra of Filippenko et al. (1995) and Clocchiatti et al. (1996b)\nallow us to address this issue. Using these spectra, a typical interstellar extinction law\n(Cardelli, Clayton, & Mathis 1989), with RV = 3.1, the transmittance of the passbands\ndescribed earlier, and typical instrumental sensitivities, it is possible to compute the\nextinction affecting the spectra and its variation with time. The estimated extinction values\nand their uncertainties are included in Table 2.\nThe lack of a spectrum of SN 1994I some 280 d after maximum affects the estimates\nof interstellar extinction at the time, but the effect is small. Most of the variations that\nstrongly affect the S\u2013corrections at late times (changes of the emission lines in the near-IR)\nhave a minor impact on the extinction.\nWe computed the extinction for the passbands of the HST WFPC2, fit smooth\npolynomials to the late-time trends, and extrapolated those from the latest observed\nspectrum out to the latest photometric point. To account for the uncertainty of the\nextrapolation, we increased the typical uncertainty of the fits by a factor of three for the\nlast point. The extinction computed for the HST observation is included in Table 1.\nThe uncertainties due to the unknown details of the ground-based standard system\nrealization and the lack of a very late-time spectrum are much smaller than the uncertainty\nof the overall extinction adopted (\u2206AV \u2248 0.5 mag according to Richmond et al. 1996). The\nchanges in the light curves associated with the variation of the broadband extinction with\ntime fall well within \u2206AV as well. However, computing the extinction from the evolving\nspectra and the expected passbands is the correct procedure for nonstellar spectra, and\nprovides light curves that, for a given velue of AV , are free from the systematic effects\nrelated to the time variation of the extinction in each passband.\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nTwo additional sources of uncertainty should me mentioned. First, the interstellar\nextinction law may not be the standard one. What can be said in this case is\nthat, if the interstellar extinction towards SN 1994I follows the functional form of\nCardelli, Clayton, & Mathis (1989) with a different value of RV the difference will be\nsmaller than the uncertainty in AV , even for the more extreme values of RV that they\nconsider. Second, it is possible that at least a fraction of the extinction is produced in the\nlocal environment of the supernova. Since this local environment will be eventually affected\nby the evolution of the ejecta, a change of the foreground extinction with time would be\nconceivable. With the data available, it is not possible to set quantitative limits to this\npossibility.\n\n4.\n\nThe Light Curves\n\nThe resulting light curves of SN 1994I in the space-based system are shown in Figure 3,\nwhile the evolution of the photometric colors is given in Figure 4. The late-time point\nis consistent with the decrease in brightness and a flattening of the light curve expected\nfrom models that fit the post maximum decline (see below), and as suggested by the\nground-based data earlier than \u223c80 d after maximum. The (RI)C magnitudes of the last\ntwo ground-based observations (at \u223c115 and \u223c140 d after maximum), and the B and V\nmagnitude of the last ground-based observation, are not consistent with this trend. They\nappear to be slightly overluminous. The observed colors indicate little or no change of the\noverall spectral shape since the latest ground-based photometry.\nWith all the photometry transformed into the same system, it is possible to convert\nthe observed single-bandpass light curves into monochromatic fluxes at the effective\nwavelengths, integrate them over wavelength, and obtain a new version of the \"BV (RI)C \"\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nlight curve of SN 1994I2 . We used the zero points for the WFPC2 passbands given by\nHoltzman et al. (1995), and integrated the monochromatic fluxes using a simple trapezoid\nrule. We did not make any assumptions regarding the behavior of the flux beyond the\nlimiting wavelengths of our coverage; flux beyond the limits of the B and IC passbands\nwas ignored. The distance of M51 was assumed to be 8.39 Mpc, based on the luminosity\nfunction of planetary nebulae (Feldmeier et al. 1997).\nThe BV (RI)C light curve of SN 1994I is shown in Figure 5, together with similarly\nconstructed light curves of the Type Ic SNe 1990B (Clocchiatti et al. 2001), 1998bw\n(Patat et al. 2001; Sollerman et al. 2002; Clocchiatti et al. 2007), and 2002ap (Tomita et al.\n2006). The latter two have been modeled with ejecta of low mass-to-energy ratio\n(Iwamoto et al. 1998; Mazzali et al. 2002), but fairly large ejected mass, and have also\nsometimes been called \"hypernovae.\" As a benchmark of absolute brightness and evolution\ntimescales, the BV (RI)C light curve of the normal Type Ia SN 1992A (N. Suntzeff, 2006,\nprivate communication) is also given.\n\n5.\n5.1.\n\nDiscussion\n\nSimple Comparisons\n\nThe light curves in Fig. 5 illustrate the wide range that SNe Ic span in absolute\nbrightness, and show that the diversity cuts across observational borders proposed to\nclassify them, like the supernova or hypernova categories. Fig. 5 also shows that SN 1994I\nwas fairly luminous reaching more than 50% of the brightness of normal Type Ia SN. A\n2\n\nEven though it was calibrated using the space-borne WFPC2 passbands, we prefer to\n\nname the light curve using the more compact designation of their equivalent ground-based\npassbands.\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nforeground extinction a few tenths of a magnitude larger, which is consistent with model\nlight curves, spectra, or high-resolution spectra of the narrow Na D absorption lines, would\nmake it as bright as SN 1992A. The BV (RI)C light curves also confirm that, similar to the\nbehavior close to maximum light, the time scale for brightness variation of SN 1994I at\nlate times was fast. The early exponential tail of SN 1994I is faster than that of the other\nType Ic SNe, and comparable to that of the Type Ia SN.\nQualitative comparison with the late-time light curves of SNe 1990B, 1998bw, and\n2002ap indicates a mismatch between the trend suggested by the last ground-based\nphotometric points and the HST observation. SN 1994I shows a sharp downward change\nof slope in the exponential tail after \u223c140 days, not seen in the other SNe Ic. The rate\nof decay measured from the data between \u223c80 and \u223c 140 d after explosion is 43% slower\nthan that measured using the points between \u223c40 and \u223c80 d, and the change happens very\nfast, between 80 and 115 d after explosion. By contrast, the decline slope of SN 1990B is\nessentially constant at these times, that of SN 1998bw changes by less than \u223c28% between\nearlier than 80 d after explosion and later than 250 d after explosion, and that of SN 2002ap\nchanges by \u223c7% in this same time period.\nIf the trend suggested by the last two ground-based photometric points were correct,\nthen something fairly dramatic happens to the BV (RI)C light curve between \u223c140 and\n\u223c300 d after maximum light. One possibility is the so-called \"infrared catastrophe\" that\nshifts energy from the optical/near-IR passbands into the far-IR (Fransson & Chevalier\n1989; Kozma & Fransson 1998), though it is not expected at such relatively early epochs in\nSNe Ic. Another possibility is that the brightness at 300 days after maximum is affected\nby a different amount of foreground local extinction, as it would happen if the ejecta of\nSN 1994I formed dust. This is, however, not consistent with the small, or nill, change in\nbroadband colors.\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\nAnother possibility is that the latest ground based photometric points are affected\nby contamination from background light from M51. Richmond et al. (1996) did image\nmatching and subtraction before performing photometry, but the background of SN 1994I\nwas particularly bright and had a steep gradient over the spatial scales sampled by the\nPSF of the ground-based images. Thus, residual contamination in the ground-based images\ncould be present.\n\n5.2.\n\nComparison with a Simple Model\n\nWhen \u03b3-ray radiative transfer can be approximated by a pure absorption process\n(Sutherland & Wheeler 1984), the radioactive nickel assumed to be located at the center\nof the ejecta, accounting for a small fraction of the total mass (i.e. a point source model\nfor the \u03b3-ray emission), and the SN ejecta modeled by a spherically symmetric distribution\nof matter in free expansion, the optical depth that extinguishes the \u03b3-rays decreases with\nthe inverse of time squared (e.g. Clocchiatti & Wheeler 1997). In this case, the energy\ndeposited by \u03b3-rays can be approximated by\n\b\nE\u03b3 \u221d exp (\u2212t/\u03c4Ni ) 1 \u2212 exp [\u2212(T0 /t)2 ] ,\nwhere \u03c4Ni is the e-folding time for the decay of\n\n56\n\n(1)\n\nCo , and T0 is the characteristic time for\n\na given ejecta structure, which depends on its mass M, energy E, density profile, and the\nabsorption cross section per unit mass (\u03ba) that matter presents to \u03b3-rays. For a given\ndensity profile, T0 \u221d (\u03baM 2 /E)1/2 . Soon after maximum light, when radiative equilibrium is\nestablished, the above assumptions are expected to hold. Then, in addition, between 100%\nand \u223c96% of the radioactive energy is released in \u03b3-rays, and most of them are trapped\nin the ejecta. In these conditions, E\u03b3 gives a good representation of the energy available\nto heat the ejecta and equation 1 can be fitted to bolometric light curves to estimate the\nparameter T0 . At later times, as the fraction of \u03b3-rays that escape from the ejecta increases,\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\nthe \u223c4% of energy released in the form of positrons needs to be considered. In what follows,\nwe will consider the two extreme possibilities for thermalization of the positron annihilation\nenergy: either they are completely trapped in the ejecta, or they escape.\nAssuming that the BV (RI)C light curve of SN 1994I, between \u223c40 and \u223c80 d after\nexplosion, is a good representation of the bolometric light curve, we fit the light curve to\ndetermine T0 \u2248 65 d, if the energy from the\n\n56\n\nCo positrons is completely deposited, or\n\nT0 \u2248 67 d, if the positrons escape from the ejecta without interacting. The BV (RI)C\nluminosity with these fitted simple models is shown in Figure 6.\nThe simple models are very good at fitting the data between \u223c40 and \u223c80 d after\nexplosion, suggesting some connection with reality, and they do a reasonably good job\nat \u223c300 d. Since the (bolometric) model implies \u223c50% more energy than the BV (RI)C\nobservation, the data taken at face value would be consistent either with full trapping of\npositrons from\n\n56\n\nCo and a small bolometric correction at \u223c300 d, or with a smaller (even\n\nnull) bolometric correction and a more complex process of positron transfer that traps\n\u223c50% of their total energy. It should be noted, though, that the simple model without\npositron trapping falls below the observed light curve. The simplest interpretation of this\nobservation is that SN 1994I did trap a significant fraction of the positrons.\nThe last two points from ground-based photometry (between \u223c100 and \u223c120 days\nafter explosion) are missed by both fits. We note, in addition, that it is not possible to\nobtain a good fit for the simple models of eq. 1 when all the ground-based observations\nof the exponential tail (between \u223c40 and \u223c120 d after explosion) are included, even if\nthe HST point at 300 d is excluded. The problem is the fast change in the slope of the\nBV (RI)C light curve between \u223c80 and \u223c115 d after explosion. Fitting this break requires\nincluding an additional free parameter, like two different values of T0 , which could represent\na model of two different mass components each of them with different expansion properties.\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\nAs a comparison, it is possible to successfully fit eq. 1 to the exponential decay of the light\ncurves of all the other SNe Ic shown in Fig. 53 .\n\n5.3.\n\nSimple Comparison with Hindsight From the Simple Model\n\nIn \u00a75.1 we compared the derived light curves of several SNe. Although it is illustrative\nto see how different SN light curves behave in a plot like that of Fig. 5, it is not completely\ncorrect to compare the evolution of different ejecta on a calendar-time basis. What we\nwould like to do is to plot the light curves using units that are more physically meaningful.\nFrom a few tens to a few hundreds of days after explosive nucleosynthesis, the evolution\nof the bolometric light curves is governed by two main time scales: \u03c4Co , the e-folding\ntime for the radioactive decay of\n\n56\n\nCo into\n\n56\n\nFe , and T0 , the characteristic time for the\n\ndecrease of the \u03b3-ray optical depth (eq. 1). They are, respectively, the time scale for energy\nproduction and the time scale for energy deposition. This suggests that the natural energy\nscale to compare late-time light curves of different SNe is LBol (tn )/ exp (\u2212tn /\u03c4Co ), where tn\nis measured since nucleosynthesis, and that the natural scale to compare the time evolution\nof the ejecta is te /T0 , where te should be measured from the start of free expansion. Since,\nat the times of interest, the difference between tn and te is negligible, either of them may\nbe used. We fitted the models of eq. 1 to the light curves of all SNe Ic in Fig. 5, and then\nnormalized the energy and time axes according to the previous prescription. The result is\nshown in Figure 7.\nIt is reassuring to confirm that such a simple scaling brings some \"order\" to Fig. 5.\nWhen the energy is normalized by the input\n3\n\n56\n\nCo source, and time by the natural scale for\n\nWe note also that eq. 1 fails to provide a good fit to the late-time light curve of the\n\nType Ia SN 1992A.\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\n\u03b3-ray deposition (responsible for most of the energy available to the ejecta from soon after\nmaximum until the supply of\n\n56\n\nCo is exhausted), all of the late-time light curves follow\n\napproximately the same track. It is possible to bring them into close agreement just by\nnormalizing the total amount of\n\n56\n\nNi ejected by the explosion (i.e. the additive constant in\n\nthe logarithm of the energy used in Fig. 5).\nThis comparison shows that, in units of the natural time scale of evolution of the\n\u03b3-ray optical depth, the late-time point of SN 1994I presented in this paper (\u223c 280 d\nafter maximum) is even more extreme than those observed for SN 1998bw and SN 2002ap,\nwhich had light curves extending beyond \u223c500 d after maximum. Also, it shows that, in\ncomparison with Eq. 1, the three very late light curves are consistent with a flattening after\n\u223c 3T0 , a time at which the \u03b3-ray optical depth becomes negligible, and most of the \u03b3-rays\nescape into space. For SN 1994I, the exact time at which the flattening occurs is unknown\ndue to the lack of observations. However, both at 3T0 \u2248 200 d, and at 300 d corresponding\nto the last observation, a modest fraction of 56 Co remains in the ejecta, and the \u223c4% of the\nradiated energy that its decay releases in the positron channel becomes a significant source.\nRegarding the late-time ground-based photometry, the scaling of Fig. 7 confirms the\narguments given before. The last two points depart from the common locus, and probably\noverestimate the luminosity of SN 1994I due to background contamination.\n\n5.4.\n\nInsights From a Detailed Model\n\nIwamoto et al. (1994) presented a model of SN 1994I which, without fine tuning of the\nstructure, provides a good fit to the early part of the UBV (RI)C light curve, from \u223c 6 d\nbefore up to \u223c 40 d after maximum light. Their preferred configuration is a C+O core\nthat would result from the evolution of a massive star in an interacting binary system that\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\nunderwent two mass-transfer episodes. Depending on the initial parameters of the binary,\nat the moment of explosion the pair consists of the presupernova and a neutron star, white\ndwarf, or low-mass main-sequence companion (Nomoto et al. 1994).\nIwamoto et al. (1994) fitted the light curves of SN 1994I provided by Schmidt (1994)\nwith the explosion of a star that entered the main sequence with \u223c 15M\u2299 , became a\n\u223c 4.0M\u2299 He star after the first mass transfer, and a 2.1 M\u2299 C+O core after the second\n(model CO21). A simultaneous fit of the monochromatic and UBV (RI)C curves required an\ninterstellar reddening of E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.45 mag, and a distance of 6.92 Mpc (m \u2212 M = 29.2\nmag), in good agreement with the values used to determine the BV (RI)C light curve\npresented here.\nWould model CO21 fit the very late-time HST photometry? The question is relevant\nbecause previous attempts at fitting SN light curves over long time spans have uncovered a\nproblem. When the models are good at fitting the maximum light they tend to be too dim\non the tail; conversely, if they are good at fitting the late-time decay, they tend to give a\nmaximum broader and/or brighter than observed. Solving this problem has typically meant\nintroducing free parameters in the density structure of the model (Ensman & Woosley\n1988; Tomita et al. 2006).\nBased on the explosion model CO21 (Iwamoto et al. 1994), and using the same radiative\ntransfer code, we calculated the monochromatic light curves, but here we extend the\ncomputations to 300 days after explosion. The assumptions and approximations used in the\ncode are described in more detail in (Iwamoto et al. 1994) and (H\u00f6flich, M\u00fcller & Khokhlov\n1993). A hypothesis relevant to our discussion below, is that all positrons are thermalized\nlocally and cannot escape. Because of the limitations of the code in the treatment of\nforbidden lines and their time dependence, we assumed the energy distribution to be\nunchanged after day 120. This assumption is consistent with the observations because the\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\ncolor indices scarcely change after about 100 d (Table 2 and Fig. 4). The assumption\nprevents us from testing overall migration of flux toward the IR, as may result from the\nformation of dust. The evolution of the colors, however, suggest that neither dust formation,\nnor other change in the foreground extinction by matter in the circumstellar region, do\noccur in this SN.\nFrom the monochromatic fluxes, we calculated the magnitudes in each relevant HST\npassband. We checked that the synthetic F 439W and F 555W values agree with the B and\nV of Iwamoto et al. (1994) within a few hundredths of a magnitude. The small differences\ncan be attributed to adjustments in the frequency grid and differences in the HST filter\nfunctions and the Bessell system, since S-corrections were not applied in this test.\nFrom the monochromatic fluxes at the effective wavelength of the passbands, we built\na BV (RI)C light curve using the same procedure as in the observations (see \u00a74). We\ncompare the theoretical light curves of model CO21 with the observations in Fig. 6. Both\nthe bolometric and BV (RI)C luminosities are plotted. They are very similar, indicating\nthat the model concentrates most of the energy within the passbands observed. Overall,\nthe model luminosities agree well with the observations, especially in the post-maximum\ndecay, although some details merit further comment.\nAt maximum, the model results dimmer than the observations, while the same model\nfits better the UBV (RI)C in Iwamoto et al. (1994). One reason for that is the distance.\nThe observed BV (RI)C light curve presented here is based on an observed distance of 8.39\nMpc (Feldmeier et al. 1997), while, for the same foreground extinction, CO21 is consistent\nwith a distance 1.47 Mpc shorter in Iwamoto et al. (1994). The shorter distance will help\nour model BV (RI)C light curve to fit the maximum better, but will give a brighter than\nrequired post maximum decay. This highlights the importance of using extensive datasets\nwhen comparing models to observations.\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\nThe BV (RI)C light curve of CO21 shown in Fig. 6 does fit most of the observed\nBV (RI)C light curve of SN 1994I. First, the distance independent width of the observed\nmaximum, and then the distance dependent brightness of the post-maximum decline\nand exponential decay. Fitting the peak-to-tail contrast will require some additional fine\ntunning.\nA possible hint is that the model UBV (RI)C light curve does a better job at fitting\nthe peak-to-tail contrast of the BV (RI)C observations, indicating that the model spectrum\noverestimates the fraction of total flux emerging in the ultraviolet at early times. In any\ncase, the problem of CO21 is opposite to the traditional peak-to-tail contrast problem: if\nthe maximum of the BV (RI)C model is arbitrarily shifted to match the observed one,\nthen the model light curve results brighter than the observed, not dimmer. Studying the\npeak-to-tail contrast problem in SN light curves is beyond the scope of this paper, so we\nwill let the issue rest there.\nThe late-time tail of the detailed model, which includes a realistic approximation to\nthe \u03b3-ray transfer and deposition, follows closely the simple deposition function given by\neq. 1, with full trapping of the positrons from the decay of\n\n56\n\nCo . Since CO21 also assumes\n\nfull trapping of positrons, this is an indication that the \u03b3-ray transfer is well represented by\nthe simple approximations that went into eq. 1. Hence, the conclusion stated above that\nabout half of the positrons are able to deposit their energy within the ejecta is supported\nby the more elaborate model as well.\n\n6.\n\nConclusions\n\nThrough the HST GO SINS program, we observed SN 1994 with WFPC2 when the\nSN was about 280 d past maximum light. We did PSF photometry on the resulting images\n\n\f\u2013 23 \u2013\nusing HSTPhot (Dolphin 2000).\nWe collected published ground-based photometry of SN 1994I, applied a reddening\ncorrection, and transformed the results to the space-based HST WFPC2 photometric\nsystem. Both the reddening correction and the photometric transformation were based\non the extensive spectroscopic database available for the SN (Filippenko et al. 1995;\nClocchiatti et al. 1996b). The resulting light curves in the F 439W , F 555W , F 675W , and\nF 814W passbands span from \u223c7 d before to \u223c280 d after maximum light.\nUsing the zero points and effective wavelengths of Holtzman et al. (1995), we\ntransformed the multicolor photometry to monochromatic flux, and then integrated the flux\nover the available wavelength range to construct a \"BV (RI)C \" light curve. We compared\nthe BV (RI)C light curve of SN 1994I with those of other SNe Ic, and, based on a simplified\nmodel of the ejecta, proposed a scaling in energy and time that provides a more insightful\ncomparison of the exponential tails of different SNe. The light curves that reach times larger\nthan \u223c 3T0 , where T0 is the characteristic time for the decay of the \u03b3-ray optical depth,\nshow a clear flattening. For rapidly evolving SNe, like SN 1994I, a simple interpretation of\nthis flattening is that the small percentage of energy that the decay of\n\n56\n\nCo releases in the\n\nform of positrons becomes a relevant thermal energy source for the ejecta.\nModel CO21, originally presented by Iwamoto et al. (1994), does a reasonable job at\nfitting both the BV (RI)C and monochromatic light curves at early times. We extended\nthe original light-curve calculations up to day 300. We note that the absolute BV (RI)C\nluminosity agrees well with the observations of SN 1994I up to about 80 d after maximum\nlight, but overestimates the flux by \u223c 50% at day 300.\nModels with full positron trapping indicate that some energy was missed by the\nobservations, but models without positron trapping indicate an observed excess of energy.\nThe missing (or excess) energy amounts to \u223c50% of that produced by the annihilation\n\n\f\u2013 24 \u2013\nof\n\n56\n\nCo positrons. Although models with no positron trapping and a migration of\n\nenergy toward the mid-to-far IR (e.g., by dust formation) cannot be ruled out, a simpler\nintepretation of these late-time observations is that the ejecta of SN 1994I trapped \u223c50%\nof the positrons roughly 300 d after the explosion.\nOur interpretation of the BV (RI)C light curve is consistent with the SN evolving as\na freely expanding envelope whose optical depth to \u03b3-rays decreases, very approximately,\nwith the inverse of time squared. Simple models that treat the deposition of \u03b3-rays as a\npure absorption process, and the more detailed model CO21, agree on this. SN 1994I does\nnot need a model with two dynamically distinct components, like the one that Tomita et al.\n(2006) propose for SN 2002ap.\nWe conclude that our very late-time BV (RI)C photometry represents most of the\nenergy that the SN produced at this time, implying that the late-time bolometric correction\nof this rapidly evolving SN Ic was not large. This, in turn, would mean that the \"infrared\ncatastrophe\" in this SN does not happen until phases later than \u223c300 d.\nAlthough model CO21 was not finely tuned to closely match the observed light curves\nof SN 1994I, it helps to show that the late-time photometry presented here is extreme in\nterms of the \u03b3-ray optical depth, and agrees with the simple models of eq. 1 in that the\ndominant source of late-time energy originates in positrons. A model built specifically to\nrepresent this SN could be used to establish a meaningful constraint on the fraction of\npositrons actually trapped in the ejecta, and whether (and when) there is a migration of\nphotons from the optical and near-IR to the IR region of the spectrum.\n\nA.C. thanks the Department of Astronomy of the University of Texas at Austin for\nsupport from a W.
