The suppression of charm and bottom quarks observed at RHIC\nmotivated several groups to utilize the guage-gravity duality [8\u201311] to compute the drag of\nfundamental heavy quarks in N = 4 Super Yang-Mills at strong coupling [12\u201314]. The goal\nof this paper is to extend these strong coupling calculations of drag and diffusion from heavy\nquarks to heavy mesons.\nThe motivation for this effort is twofold. First, future experiments at RHIC promise to\nmeasure the elliptic flow of J/\u03c8 mesons, and it is important to support this experimental\nprogram with theoretical work. To this end, various groups have studied the thermal properties of heavy mesons within the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence [15\u201318]. However,\nin spite of this progress, the transport properties of these mesonic excitations are not well\nunderstood. Although the kinetics derived in this paper are not directly applicable to the\nheavy ion experiments, we believe that the results do hold some important information for\nphenomenology.\n\u2217\n\nElectronic address: kdusling@gmail.com\nElectronic address: jke@mppmu.mpg.de\n\u2021\nElectronic address: kaminski@mppmu.mpg.de\n\u00a7\nElectronic address: rust@mppmu.mpg.de\n\u00b6\nElectronic address: derek.teaney@stonybrook.edu\n\u2217\u2217\nElectronic address: young@tonic.physics.sunysb.edu\n\u2020\n\n\f2\nThe second motivation for this work is theoretical. After the quark drag was computed\nusing the correspondence, it was realized that the drag of quarkonia is zero in a large Nc\nlimit [15, 16, 18]. In the high temperature phase (when the temperature is comparable\nto the mass of lowest meson state) the vector spectral function has been computed and it\nshows a rich dynamical picture of meson melting [19\u201323]. However, in the low temperature\nphase describing heavy mesons, the spectral function is usually described by a sequence of\nstates with zero width. Since within a thermal environment the drag and diffusion of these\nmesonic states is certainly not zero, it remained as a theoretical challenge to compute the\nkinetics of these states using the AdS/CFT setup.\nRising to this challenge, the width of AdS/CFT mesons due to scattering with surrounding heavy quarks (or anti-quarks) was recently determined by extending the analysis of\nmeson melting to finite baryon density [19] and by studying string worldsheet instantons at\nzero baryon density [24]. In general the meson width determined in this way is suppressed\nby the density of heavy quarks. (At zero baryon density the width is suppressed by the\nthermal population of heavy quarks.) In contrast, we are concerned with the thermal width\nwhich is finite at zero density and infinite \u03bb and captures the rescattering between the meson\nand the surrounding N = 4 medium.\nThis work will focus on heavy mesons where the binding energy is much greater than\nthe temperature. While in perturbation theory the constraint on the binding energy reads\n\u221a q \u001d T . In this tight\nmq v 2 \u001d T , in the strongly coupled N = 4 theory the constraint is 2\u03c0m\n\u03bb\nbinding regime, mesons survive well above Tc and the meson width is sufficiently narrow to\nspeak sensibly about drag and momentum diffusion.\nFor real charmonium (bottomonium) the binding energy can be estimated from mass\nJ/\u03c8\n\u03a5\nsplitting between the 2s and 1s (3s and 1s) states, \u2206M2s\u22121s ' 589 MeV and \u2206M3s\u22121s\n'\n895 MeV respectively [25]. Therefore it is not really clear that real quarkonia above Tc '\n170 \u2194 190 MeV [26, 27] can be modeled as a simple dipole which lives long enough to\nbe considered a quasi-particle. Indeed weak coupling hot QCD calculations of the spectral\nfunction show that over the temperature range g 2 M \u2194 gM , the concept of a meson quasiparticle slowly transforms from being well defined to being increasingly vague [28\u201332]. There\nis lattice evidence based on the maximal entropy method (which is not without uncertainty)\nthat J/\u03c8 and \u03a5 survive to 1.6 Tc and \u223c 3 Tc respectively [33\u201338]. However, model potential\ncalculations which fit all the Euclidean lattice correlators indicate that the the J/\u03c8 and \u03a5\nsurvive only up to at most 1.2 Tc and 2.0 Tc respectively [39, 40]. Clearly, the word \"survive\"\nin this context is qualitative and means that there is a discernible peak in the spectral\nfunction. Given these facts, the assessment of the authors is that the dipole approximation\nmight be reasonable for \u03a5(1S) but poor for charmonium states and other bottomonium\nstates.\nWithin the context of guage gravity duality, mesons are studied by exploiting convenient\ngeneralizations of the AdS/CFT correspondence in which fundamental flavor degrees of\nfreedom are added by inserting additional probe branes into the geometry. In this paper we\nwill use the approach due to Karch and Katz [41] in which the additional quark flavors are\nobtained by adding D7 brane probes to the original D3 brane setup. On the gravity side,\nthe probe branes wrap a subspace which asymptotically near the boundary is AdS5 \u00d7 S 3 .\n\n\f3\nThe meson spectrum for the dual N = 2 supersymmetric gauge theory was first calculated\nin [42] by considering fluctuations of the D7 branes embedded. Restricting this result to\nfluctuations with vanishing angular momentum on the S 3 , the meson spectrum is given by\n2\u03c0mq p\nM = \u221a 2 (n + 1)(n + 2) ,\n\u03bb\n\n(1.1)\n\nwith mq the quark mass determined by the separation between the D3 and D7 branes, \u03bb the\n't Hooft coupling and n the radial excitation number. Subsequently, a gravity dual of chiral\nsymmetry breaking has been obtained in [43] by embedding a D7 brane probe into a deformed\nnon-supersymmetric gravity background with non-trivial dilaton [44]. In this case there is a\nGoldstone boson in the meson spectrum. The thermodynamics of mesons has been studied\nwithin gauge/gravity duality by embedding a D7 brane probe into the AdS-Schwarzschild\nblack hole background. Within the deconfined phase, there is a new fundamental first order\nphase transition which corresponds to meson melting [21, 43, 45\u201347]. For a review on mesons\nin the AdS/CFT correspondence see [48].\nIn this paper we consider a heavy meson moving slowly through the medium. We perform both a perturbative QCD and a strong coupling N = 4 SYM computation. For both\napproaches we first calculate the in medium meson mass shift, which determines the polarizabilities of the meson. As expected from the dipole effective theory, the mass shift scales as\nT 4 /\u039b3B , with T the temperature and \u039bB the inverse size of the meson. In the perturbative\ncalculation, \u039bB is the inverse Bohr radius, while in the AdS/CFT computation the meson\nmass plays this role. In the N = 4 field theory the dipole effective Lagrangian couples the\nheavy meson to the stress tensor and the square of the field strength OF 2 . In AdS/CFT we\nobtain these couplings from the linear response of the meson mass to switching on a black\nhole background or a non-trivial dilaton flow, respectively. For the dilaton flow we consider\nthe D3 + D(\u22121) gravity background of Liu and Tseytlin [49]. This background and the\nAdS-Schwarzschild background allow for an analytic calculation of the meson polarizabilities.\nUsing these polarizabilities we subsequently calculate the momentum broadening \u03ba and\nthe drag coefficient \u03b7D . This requires the calculation of two-point functions involving gradients of the stress tensor and the field strength squared. Within gauge/gravity duality, these\nare obtained by considering graviton and dilaton propagation through the AdS-Schwarzschild\nblack hole background.\nAn outline of the paper is as follows. First, in Section II we review the computation\nof drag and diffusion of heavy QQ\u0304 bound states within the setup of pertubative QCD.\nThis will outline a two step procedure to determine the drag coefficient at strong coupling.\nThe first step is to determine the in medium mass shift (which is finite at large Nc ) which\ndetermines the polarizabilities of the meson. This is done in section Section III. The second\nstep is to compute the force-force correlator on the meson using the previously computed\npolarizabilities. This determines the drag and diffusion coefficient as reviewed in Section IV.\nFinally we compare our results to perturbation theory and reach some conclusions for the\nRHIC experiments in Section V.\n\n\f4\nII.\n\nDIFFUSION OF HEAVY MESONS IN PERTURBATIVE LARGE N FIELD\nTHEORIES\nA.\n\nDiffusion of Heavy Mesons in Perturbative large N QCD\n\nThe interactions of a heavy meson with the QCD medium is well described by a dipole\napproximation. This physical approximation has been formalized in the language of heavy\nmeson effective Lagrangrians which we will adopt [50]. This perturbative scheme relies on\nthe large mass of the meson relative to the external momenta of the gauge fields but does\nnot rely on the smallness of the coupling constant. It was used previously to make a good\nestimate for the binding of J/\u03c8 to nuclei [50].\nThe heavy meson field \u03c6v describes a (scalar) meson which has a fixed velocity v \u03bc =\n(\u03b3, \u03b3v). Then the effective Lagrangian for this meson field interacting with the gauge fields\nis\ncE\ncB\nLeff = \u2212\u03c6\u2020v iv * \u2202\u03c6v + 2 \u03c6\u2020v OE \u03c6v + 2 \u03c6\u2020v OB \u03c6v ,\n(2.1)\nN\nN\nwith\n1\n1\n1\n(2.2)\nOE = \u2212 G\u03bc\u03b1A G\u03b1 \u03bdA v\u03bc v\u03bd , OB = G\u03b1\u03b2A G\u03b1\u03b2 A \u2212 G\u03bc\u03b1A G\u03b1 \u03bdA v\u03bc v\u03bd .\n2\n4\n2\nG\u03bc\u03bd is the non-Abelian field strength of QCD, and cE and cB are matching coefficients (polarizabilities) to be determined from the QCD dynamics of the heavy QQ\u0304 pair. In inserting\na factor of 1/N 2 into the effective Lagrangrian we have anticipated that the couplings of the\nheavy meson to the field strengths are suppressed by N 2 in the large N limit.\nIn the rest frame of a heavy quark bound state, v = (1, 0, 0, 0), the operators OE and OB\nare\n1\n1\nOB = BA * BA ,\n(2.3)\nO E = EA * EA ,\n2\n2\nwhere EA and BA are the color electric and magnetic fields. If the constituents of the dipole\nare non-relativistic it is expected that the magnetic polarizability cB is O(v 2 ) relative to the\nelectric polarizability. For heavy quarks (where cB is neglected) and large N these matching\ncoefficients were computed by Peskin [51, 52]\ncE =\n\n28\u03c0\n,\n3\u039b3B\n\ncB = 0 .\n\n(2.4)\n\nHere \u039bB \u2261 1/a0 = (mq /2)CF \u03b1s is the inverse Bohr radius for a QQ\u0304 bound state. It is finite\nat large N since with CF ' N/2 and finite \u03bb we have \u039bB = mq \u03bb/16\u03c0. We will assume that\ncB = 0 is zero in this section and subsequently generalize our results to N = 4 theory.\nThis effective Lagrangian can be used to compute both the thermodynamics and kinetics\nof the heavy meson state. First, to evaluate the in medium mass shift one simply uses first\norder perturbation theory \u03b4M = hHI i = \u2212 hLI i, yielding\ncE\n\u03b4M = \u2212 2 hOE iT\nN\n\u0012\n\u00133\n(2.5)\n\u03c0T\n14\n= \u2212T\n.\n\u039bB\n45\n\n\f5\n2\n\nIn the second line we have simply calculated the expectation value hOE iT = \u03c030 N 2 T 4 in a\nfree gluon gas and used Eq. (2.4).\nThe importance of this result is that it is finite at large N and that it is in general\nsuppressed by (T /\u039bB )3 , i.e. suppressed by powers of the hadron scale to the temperature. If\nhigher dimension operators were added to the effective Lagrangian their contributions would\nbe suppressed by additional powers of T /\u039bB . At strong coupling, we will use the AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence to determine the N = 4 polarizabilities from the mass shift.\nWe turn next to the kinetics of a heavy dipole in the medium. For timescales which are\nlong compared to medium correlations, we expect that the kinetics of the heavy meson is\ndescribed by Langevin equations\ndpi\n= \u03bei (t) \u2212 \u03b7D pi ,\nh\u03bei (t)\u03bej (t0 )i = \u03ba\u03b4ij \u03b4(t \u2212 t0 ) .\n(2.6)\ndt\nHere \u03bei is a random force with second moment \u03ba and \u03b7D is the drag coefficient. The drag\nand fluctuation coefficients are related through the Einstein relation\n\u03ba\n\u03b7D =\n.\n(2.7)\n2M T\nThe Langevin equation is valid for times which are long compared to the inverse temperature\nbut short compared to the lifetime of the quasi-particle state.\nWe can use the effective dipole Lagrangian to calibrate the noise of the stochastic evolution, \u03ba. The microscopic equations of motion for a heavy particle in the medium are\ndpi\n= F i (t) ,\n(2.8)\ndt\nwhere F is a phenomenological force to be specified below.

The\nmatching coefficient cE is directly related to the mass shift of the dipole and encodes the\ncoupling of the long distance gluonic fields to the dipole. By taking the ratio between the\nmomentum broadening and the mass shift squared we find a physical quantity which is\nindependent of this coupling\n\u03ba\n\u03c0T 1280\n.\n(2.19)\n= 2\n2\n(\u03b4M )\nN\n3\nThe large numerical factor 1280/3 originates from the cross section which grows as \u03c9 4 . A\nsimilarly large factor appears in N = 4 SYM as discussed below in greater detail.\nB.\n\nLinear perturbations of N = 4 Super Yang-Mills theory\n\nOur aim is to calculate the heavy meson diffusion coefficient \u03ba from gauge/gravity duality. This requires the calculation of the two-point correlators as well as of the associated\npolarizabilities in N = 4 Super Yang-Mills theory.\nThe same formalism used in the preceding section can be used for N = 4 SU (N ) Super\nYang-Mills theory. In general all operators in N = 4 which are scalars under under Lorentz\ntransformations and SU (4) R-charge rotations will couple to the meson at some order. The\ncontribution of higher dimensional operators is suppressed by powers of the temperature to\nthe inverse size of the meson. The lowest dimension operator which could couple to the\nheavy meson field is OX 2 = tr X i X i , where X i denotes the scalar fields of N = 4 theory.\nHowever the anomalous dimension of this operator is not protected, and the prediction of\nthe supergravity description of N = 4 SYM is that these operators decouple in a strong\ncoupling limit [11]. The lowest dimension gauge invariant local operators which are singlets\nunder SU (4) and which have protected anomalous dimension are the stress tensor T\u03bc\u03bd which\ncouples to the graviton, minus the Lagrangian OF 2 = \u2212LN =4 , which couples to the dilaton1\nand the operator OF F\u0303 = tr F \u03bc\u03bd F\u0303\u03bc\u03bd +. . ., which couples to the axion. An interaction involving\nOF F\u0303 breaks CP which is a symmetry of the Lagrangian N = 2 hypermultiplet of the N = 4\nSYM gauge theory. Thus interactions involving OF F\u0303 can be neglected.\nSummarizing the preceding discussion, we find that the effective Langrangian describing\nthe interactions of a heavy meson coupling to the operators in the field theory is\ncF\ncT\nLeff = \u2212\u03c6v (x, t)iv *\u2202\u03c6v (x, t) + 2 \u03c6\u2020v (x, t)T \u03bc\u03bd v\u03bc v\u03bd \u03c6v (x, t) + 2 \u03c6\u2020v (x, t)OF 2 \u03c6v (x, t) , (2.20)\nN\nN\n1\n\nSince we can add a total derivative to the Lagrangian, the operator \u2212L is ambiguous. The precise form\nof the operator coupling to the dilaton is given in Ref. [53]. We neglect this ambiguity here.\n\n\f8\nwhich is a linear perturbation of N = 4 Super Yang-Mills theory by two composite operators.\nThe polarization coefficients cT , cF will be determined below from meson mass shifts in\ngauge/gravity duality. This requires breaking some of the supersymmetry. For the contribution of the energy-momentum tensor, this is achieved by switching on the temperature.\nThen, the mass shift of the meson is given by expectation value of the stress tensor\n\u03b4M = \u2212\n\ncT\nT 00 ,\n2\nN\n\n(2.21)\n\nIn gauge/gravity duality this is achieved by considering the AdS-Schwarzschild black hole\nbackground where hOF 2 i = 0. In contrast, for the meson response to hOF 2 i we consider a\nbackground self-dual gauge configuration where hOF 2 i =\n6 0 while hT \u03bc\u03bd i = 0. As can be seen\nfrom the supersymmetry transformations of the N = 4 fermions, such a background breaks\nthe supersymmetry to N = 2. The mass shift of a heavy meson is then\n\u03b4M = \u2212\n\ncF\nhOF 2 i ,\nN2\n\n(2.22)\n\nwhere hOF 2 i = h\u2212Li is the expectation value of the N = 4 Lagrangian in the N = 2 symmetric background configuration. A suitable dilaton solution corresponding to this selfdual\nconfiguration been given by Liu and Tseytlin [49] and will be used below to determine cF .\nAs explained above for the QCD case, to determine the kinetics of the heavy meson in\nthe N = 4 background we identify the force on the heavy meson as minus the gradient of the\ninteraction Hamiltonian HI = \u2212LI averaged over the meson wave function. With Eq. (2.20)\nwe have\nZ\ni\nhc\ncF 2\nT\n\u03bc\u03bd\n3\n\u2020\nT u\u03bc u\u03bd + 2 OF 2 \u03c6v (x, t) .\n(2.23)\nF (t) = d x \u03c6v (x, t) \u2207\nN2\nN\nThen integrating out the heavy meson fields as above, the force-force correlator in Eq.

(2.24) we have implicitly assumed that there is no cross term between OF 2\nand T \u03bc\u03bd v\u03bc v\u03bd . In the gauge/gravity duality this is reflected in the fact that at tree level in\n2\nSU GRA\nsupergravity, \u223c \u03b4g\u03b4 00S(x)\u03b4\u03a6(y)\n= 0.\nIn summary, we first will determine the polarizabilites cF and cT from the mass shifts of\nthe meson in two different backgrounds using Eq. (2.21) and Eq. (2.22). Subsequently we\nwill compute the correlators in Eq. (2.25) for N = 4 theory at finite temperature. Finally we\nwill put the results together using Eq. (2.24) to deduce the rate of momentum broadening.\n\n\f9\nIII.\n\nDETERMINING MATCHING COEFFICIENTS WITH MASS SHIFTS\nA.\n\nBackgrounds dual to finite temperature and field strength\n1.\n\nFinite temperature background\n\nThe gravity background dual to N = 4 SYM theory at finite temperature is given by\nthe AdS-Schwarzschild black hole with Lorentzian signature (see e.g. [54]). This background is needed below both for calculating the necessary two-point correlators hT 00 T 00 i\nand hOF 2 OF 2 i, as well as for obtaining the meson polarizability, cT .\nWe make use of the coordinates of [43] to write the AdS-Schwarzschild background with\nLorentzian signature as\n\u0013\n\u0012 2\n\u0001\nR2\nf\nw2\n2\n2\n2\n \u0303\nds = 2 \u2212 dt + f dx + 2 d%2 + %2 d\u03a923 + dw52 + dw62 ,\n(3.1)\nR\nw\nf \u0303\nwith the metric d\u03a923 of the unit 3-sphere, and\n4\n4\nrH\n \u0303(r) = 1 + rH ,\n,\nf\nw2 = %2 + w52 + w62 ,\n4w4\n4w4\nrH = T \u03c0R2 ,\nR4 = 4\u03c0gs N `4s ,\n\u03bb = 4\u03c0gs N,\ngY2 M = gs .\n\nf (r) = 1 \u2212\n\n(3.2)\n\nThis spacetime has a horizon at wH which is determined by rH as\nrH\nwH = \u221a ,\n2\n\n(3.3)\n\nand the boundary is reached at asymptotically large w. With rH = 0 we obtain AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 .\nIn section IV we will work in a coordinate system with inverted radial AdS coordinate u\nused in e.g. [54].

Stable embeddings are obtained if the\nD7 brane spans all Minkowski directions as well as the radial AdS coordinate and a 3-sphere\nin the remaining polar directions. Consider the metric (3.1) as an example. The D7 brane\nspans all directions except w5 and w6 . The meson mass M is then obtained by solving the\nequation of motion for the fluctuations \u03c6\u0303 [42]. Read as an eigenvalue equation, the equation\nof motion gives the meson mass as the eigenvalues M to the corresponding eigenfunctions\n\u03c6\u0303. The discrete values of M describe the Kaluza-Klein mass spectrum of mesons for any\ngiven quark mass.\nTo see how this works, we outline this procedure for the vacuum case hT 00 i = hOF 2 i =\n0, for which the meson spectrum was originally calculated in [42]. Subsequently we will\nintroduce a non-zero hOF 2 i and hT 00 i, respectively.\nIn the case of a D7 brane embedded in a ten dimensional background, the brane embedding is described by the location in the two directions transverse to the brane. We call these\ndirections w5 and w6 . In general these locations depend on all eight coordinates \u03be i of the\neight dimensional D7 brane worldvolume and are determined by extremizing the DBI-action\nZ\n\u221a\n\u2202X \u03bc \u2202X \u03bd st\n8\n\u2212\u03a6\n\u2212 det h ,\nhab =\nG ,\n(3.10)\nSDBI = \u2212T7 d \u03be e\n\u2202\u03be a \u2202\u03be b \u03bc\u03bd\nwhere T7 is the D7 brane tension and Gst is the string frame metric of the ten dimensional\nbackground with coordinates X \u03bc . It is related to the Einstein metric as in Eq. (3.7). The distinction between the Einstein and string frame is ultimately important below. The pullback\n2\n\nFor the conventions note that in our notation q =\nTseytlin [49].\n\nR8\n\u03bb qLT ,\n\nwhere qLT is used in the paper of Liu and\n\n\f11\nh contains the functions w5 (\u03be) and w6 (\u03be), which are determined by solving their equations\nof motion, derived from SDBI .\nThe background AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 dual to hT 00 i = hOF 2 i = 0 is obtained e.g. from (3.1) with\nrH = 0. It is well known that for this background a probe brane embedding is given by the\nfunctions\nw5 = 0 ,\n\n(3.11)\n\nw6 = L ,\n\n(3.12)\n\nwhere w5 and w6 are the coordinates given in (3.1) and the constant L determines the quark\nmass mq = L/(2\u03c0`2s ). Now we allow for small fluctuations \u03c6\u03035 and \u03c6\u03036 around this solution,\nw5 = 2\u03c0`2s \u03c6\u03035 (~x, %) ,\nw6 = L +\n\n2\u03c0`2s\n\n(3.13)\n\n\u03c6\u03036 (~x, %) .\n\n(3.14)\n\nBy the symmetries of the setup, the fluctuations only depend on the Minkowski directions ~x\nand on the coordinate %, denoting the radial coordinate on the part of the D7 brane which\nis transverse to the Minkowski directions. The resulting equations of motion are identical\nfor \u03c6\u03035 and \u03c6\u03036 . Using \u03c6 to denote any one of them, it was shown in [42] that a solution to\nthe equations of motion may be obtained by separating variables with the ansatz\n~\n\n\u03c6\u0303 = \u03c6(%) ei k~x Y ` (S 3 ) ,\n\n(3.15)\n\nwhere Y ` (S 3 ) are the scalar spherical harmonics on the S 3 wrapped by the probe D7 brane\nand ~k denotes a four vector.

(2.24) we need to compute the following correlators at finite temperature\nZ\n\u0002\n\u0003\nTT\nGR (\u03c9, q) = \u2212i d4 x e+i\u03c9t\u2212iq*x \u03b8(t) T 00 (x, t), T 00 (0, 0) ,\n(4.1)\nZ\nFF\nGR (\u03c9, q) = \u2212i d4 x e+i\u03c9t\u2212iq*x \u03b8(t) h[OF 2 (x, t), OF 2 (0, 0)]i .\n(4.2)\nThe calculational procedure for these two correlators is standard and has been discussed in\n[57, 58]. T 00 correlators are associated with graviton propagation and OF 2 correlators are\nassociated with dilaton propagation.\nOn the gravity side both field correlators are computed in the black hole background (3.1)\nplacing the dual gauge theory operator correlation functions at finite temperature. For\nsimplicity in this section we work in the conventions and coordinates of [54]. We apply\nthe method developed in [57, 58] and first applied in [54], in order to find the two-point\nMinkowski correlators as\nGR (\u03c9, q) = A(u) f (u, \u2212~k) \u2202u f (u, ~k)\n\nu\u21920\n\n.\n\n(4.3)\n\nThe function f (u, ~k) relates the boundary and bulk values of a gravity field to each other.\nFor example the dilaton field \u03a6 is related to its value at the boundary \u03c6bdy by\n\u03a6(u, ~k) = f (u, ~k) \u03c6bdy (~k) ,\n\n(4.4)\n\n\f16\nand is normalized to one at the boundary f (0, ~k) = 1. For metric fluctuations, \u03a6(u, ~k) is\nreplaced by h00 (u, ~k). The factor A(u) can be read off from the classical supergravity action\nZ\n1\nScl =\ndu d4 x A(u) (\u2202u \u03a6)2 + . . . .\n(4.5)\n2\nThe classical gravity action for the graviton and dilaton is obtained from (3.5) as\n\u0015\n\u0014\nZ\n\u221a\n1\n1\n4\n2\n(4.6)\nS = 2 du d x \u2212g5 (R \u2212 2\u039b) \u2212 (\u2202\u03a6) + . . . ,\n2\u03ba5\n2\nwhere\n\n1\nR 5 \u03a95\nN2\n=\n=\n.\n\u03ba25\n\u03ba210\n4\u03c0 2 R3\n\n(4.7)\n\nSo comparing to (4.5) we get\n\n1 \u221a\n\u2212g5 g uu .\n2\u03ba25\nThe equation of motion derived from (4.6) in momentum space reads\nA\u03a6 = \u2212\n\n\u03a600 \u2212\n\n1 + u2 0 w2 \u2212 q2 f (u)\n\u03a6 +\n\u03a6=0,\nuf (u)\nuf (u)2\n\n(4.8)\n\n(4.9)\n\nwith the function f (u) = 1 \u2212 u2 , the dimensionless frequency w = \u03c9/2\u03c0T and spatial momentum component q = q/2\u03c0T . The equation of motion (4.9) has to be solved numerically\nwith incoming wave boundary condition at the black hole horizon. Computing the indices\nand expansion coefficients near the boundary as done in [59, 60], we obtain the asymptotic\nbehavior as linear combination of two solutions\n\u03a6(u) = (1 + . . . ) + B(u2 + . . . ) ,\n\n(4.10)\n\nwhere B is the coefficient for the second solution and the coefficient for the first solution has\nbeen set to 1. At the horizon the asymptotic solution satisfying the incoming wave boundary\ncondition is\n\u03a6(u) = (1 \u2212 u)\u2212iw/2 (1 + . . . ) .\n(4.11)\nAs discussed in [59, 60] we find the coefficient B by integrating the two boundary solutions\nfrom (4.10) forward towards the horizon and by matching the linear combination of the numerical solutions \u03a6(u) = \u03a6num\n+ B\u03a6num\nto the solution (4.11) at the horizon.

This is as expected for relativistic bound\nstates. Below we will compare the values of the ratio \u03ba/(\u03b4M 2 ) at strong and weak coupling.\nPerhaps the theoretically most important aspect of this work is that we have deduced\na drag coefficient which is suppressed by N 2 in the large N limit. On the field theory\nside, this was achieved by calculating the mass shift of a meson in an external background\n(which is finite at large N ), and using this information to deduce the meson couplings to the\nstress tensor and the operator OF 2 . We have restricted the calculation to the heavy dipole\nlimit where these are the only relevant operators. Subsequently, the fluctuations of these\noperators give rise to a net force on the meson.\nOn the gravity side, the meson mass shift arises as a change in the normal vibrational\nmodes of the D7 brane in the presence of an external gravitational (or dilatonic) field.\n\n\fcE =\u21d2 K\n\ncE\n\n18\nP\u0304\n\ncT\n\ncT\n\nFIG. 3: Feynman graph leading to scattering of a heavy meson in perturbation theory. This graph\nrepresents the gauge contribution to correlators given in Eq. (5.7). At strong coupling the effect of\nadditional scatterings is to reduce the integrated value of this correlator by almost a factor of five\nin the appropriate kinematic regime.\n\nAlthough it is not manifest in the usual black hole finite temperature AdS/CFT setup,\nthe gravitational field and dilatonic fields are continually fluctuating. This is encoded by\nthe fluctuation dissipation theorem in the field theory which does emerge in a Kruskal\nformalism of the gauge gravity duality. (The fluctuation dissipation theorem was used to\nrelate Eq. (2.10) and Eq. (2.12).) Since these fluctuating gravitational and dilatonic fields\nshift the spectrum of the D7 brane excitations, gradients in these fields give rise to a net force\non a mesonic normal modes of the D7 brane. This discussion suggests a better understanding\nof how gravitational and dilatonic fields fluctuate in bulk, would give a straightforward\nprocedure to calculate the drag of a finite mass meson. Specifically, fluctuations in the bulk\nwould force motion of meson wave functions which extend into the fifth dimension. We hope\nto pursue this reasoning in the future.\nFrom a phenomenological perspective the current calculation was limited to very heavy\nmesons (which survive above Tc ) where dipole interactions between the meson and the\nmedium are dominant. It is certainly unclear if this is the relevant interaction mechanism\nabove Tc even for bottomonium. Furthermore, the dipole coupling between a heavy meson and the medium is dominated by short distance physics which is not well modeled by\nAdS/CFT.\nHowever, after the gluons scatter off the heavy quark, they propagate out into plasma\nwhich modifies the free propagation as indicated by the Feynman graph in Fig. 3. To\nfactorize this long distance dynamics from the short distance meson dynamics we form the\nratio\n\u0015\n\u0014\nZ \u221e\n\u22121\n\u03ba\n'\ndt \u22072y T 00 (y, t)T 00 (x, 0) y=x ,\n(\u03b4M )2 \u03bb\u2192\u221e (hT 00 i)2 \u2212\u221e\n(5.7)\n\u03c0T\n' 2 8.25 ,\nN\nwhich is independent of the short distance coefficients cT and cF provided the numerically\n\n\f19\nsmall dilatonic contribution is neglected3 . It is then reasonable to use AdS/CFT to estimate to what degree strong coupling physics modifies this ratio in QCD. In the free finite\ntemperature N = 4 theory, the result is (see Appendix A)\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u03ba\n\u03c0T\n' 2 37.0 ,\n(5.8)\n2\n(\u03b4M ) \u03bb\u21920 N\nThus comparing the strong coupling result (5.7) with the weak-coupling result (5.8), we\nconclude that strong coupling effects actually reduce the scattering rate relative to the mass\nshift. Roughly speaking, the same strong coupling physics that is responsible for the reduction of pressure (by a factor of 3/4) relative to the Stefan-Boltzmann prediction is at work\nhere. However the effect is more pronounced since the correlator in Eq. (5.7) is dominated\nby larger values of spatial momentum q.\nGiven this AdS/CFT result we expect the perturbative estimates for the rate of momentum broadening to be reduced by some factor which could be as large as a factor of five. We\nwill not speculate on this factor here but simply write the perturbative momentum diffusion\nrate as\n1280\u03c0\n\u03baQCD = T (\u03b4M )2\n,\n(5.9)\n3N 2\nwith a gravitionally biased opinion that the coefficient is too large. To obtain a numerical\nestimate for the \u03a5(1s) state, we take T = 340 MeV ' 2Tc , M0 = 9.46 GeV, and estimate\nthe mass shift as \u03b4M ' \u221210 MeV based on potential model calculations which fit lattice\ndata [39, 40].

We will use the Matsubara formalism though the real\ntime formalism is not more difficult in this case. We will work in the Coulomb gauge where\nthe propogators are\nZ \u03b2 Z\n1\n(A1)\nd\u03c4 d3 x e\u2212iK*X hA0 (X)A0 (0)i = 2 ,\nk\n0\nZ \u03b2 Z\nk\u0302i k\u0302j \u2212 \u03b4ij\nd\u03c4 d3 x e\u2212iK*X hAi (X)Aj (0)i =\n.\n(A2)\nK2\n0\nHere we follow standard thermal field theory notation K \u03bc = (\u03c9n , k) and X \u03bc = (\u03c4, x) with\nk = |k|. \u03c9n = 2\u03c0nT labels the Matsubara and K * X = \u03c9n \u03c4 + k * x. The Euclidean metric is\ngE\u03bc\u03bd = diag(+, +, +, +) and further explanation of Euclidean conventions is given in Ref. [61]\n. Then the Euclidean correlator corresponding to Eq. (2.14) and Fig. 4 for a single color\nindex\nZ\n1 X d3 p 0 0 p\u0302i p\u0302j \u2212 \u03b4ij 0 0 p\u0304\u02c6j p\u0304\u02c6i \u2212 \u03b4ji\nE 2E 2\nGE (K) = T\nP P\u0304\nP P\u0304\n+ Coulomb graphs\n(A3)\n2\n(2\u03c0)3\nP2\nP\u0304 2\n0\nP\n\nhere P\u0304 = P \u2212 K and we do not write the graphs involving coulomb lines since these do not\ncontribute to the imaginary part. Performing the Matsubara sum, analytically continuing\n\u2212iK 0 \u2192 \u03c9 + i\u000f, taking the imaginary part, and finally working in the limit that \u03c9 \u2192 0\n\n\f21\nyields the following result for the imaginary part of the retarded correlator\nZ\nd3 p\nd3 p\u0304\n\u22122T\nE 2E 2\nImGR (\u03c9, k) =\nnp (1+np )2\u03c0\u03b4(Ep \u2212Ep\u0304 )(2\u03c0)3 \u03b4 3 (p\u2212p\u0304\u2212k) |M|2 ,\nlim\n\u03c9\u21920 \u03c9\n(2\u03c0)3 2Ep (2\u03c0)3 2Ep\u0304\n(A4)\nwith\n\u0001\n(A5)\n|M|2 = (Ep Ep\u0304 )2 1 + cos2 (\u03b8pp\u0304 .\nThe details of the preceding steps can be streamlined and are found in many places; see\nRef. [61] and the text book [62] for simple explanations. Integrating over the retarded\ncorrelator as required by Eq. (2.14) and multiplying by N 2 to account for the number of\ngluons yields the following result\n\u03ba=\n\nc2E 64\u03c0 5 9\nT .\nN 2 135\n\n(A6)\n\nThis result is the expected kinetic theory result for the rate of momentum diffusion of a\nheavy meson scattering via dipole scattering.\n2.\n\nN = 4 Computation\n\nThe free N = 4 Lagrangian is written as follows:\n\u001b\n\u001a\n1\n1 2 1\na\n\u03bc\nL = 2 tr \u2212 F + \u03bb\u0304a (\u2212i\u03c3\u0304 * \u2202)\u03bb \u2212 \u2202\u03bc Xi \u2202 Xi ,\n4\n2\n2\n\n(A7)\n\nwhere \"a\" is a SU(4) index and \"i\" is a SO(6) index. Under flavor rotation, \u03bba transforms in\nthe fundamental representation of SU(4) and X i transforms as the fundamental representation of SO(6). SU(4) and SO(6) are locally isomorphic. SU(4) matrices are parameterized as\n4\nei\u03b2A (T )A with trace normalization tr[(T 4 )A (T 4 )B ] = C4 \u03b4AB and C4 = 1/2. Similarly, SO(6)\n6\nmatrices are written as ei\u03b2A (T )A , with trace normalization C6 = 1 [63]. The normalization\nconvention adopted here has been fixed so that the AdS/CFT correspondence holds at the\nlevel of non-renormalized two point functions at zero temperature [64].\nThe full stress tensor is written\nT \u03bc\u03bd = (T \u03bc\u03bd )gauge + (T \u03bc\u03bd )fermion + (T \u03bc\u03bd )scalar ,\n\n(A8)\n\nwith\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\n(T )gauge\n(T \u03bc\u03bd )fermion\n(T \u03bc\u03bd )scalar\n\u2190\n\u2192 \u2192\n\u2212 \u2190\n\u2212\nHere \u2202 \u2261 \u2202 \u2212 \u2202 .\n\n\u0013\u001b\n1 2\n,\n= 2 tr\n+g\n\u2212 F\n4\n\u0012\n\u0013\u001b\n\u001a \u0010\n\u0011\n\u2192\n\u2192\ni\n1 a\n\u03bc\u2190\n\u03bd\n\u03bd\u2190\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\u03bd\n= 2 tr\n\u03bb\u0304 \u03c3\u0304 \u2202 + \u03c3\u0304 \u2202 \u03bb + g\n\u03bb\u0304 (\u2212i\u03c3\u0304 * \u2202)\u03bba\n,\n8\n2\n\u001a\n\u0012\n\u0013\u001b\n1\n\u03bc\n\u03bd\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03b1\n= 2 tr \u2202 Xi \u2202 Xi + g\n\u2212 \u2202\u03b1 Xi \u2202 Xi\n.\n2\n\u001a\n\nF\u03ba\u03bc F \u03bd\u03ba\n\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\n\u0012\n\n(A9)\n(A10)\n(A11)\n\n\f22\nThere are three graphs for the gauge, fermion, and scalar loops which make a contribution\nto the imaginary part of the retarded correlator. The full diffusion rate is\n\u03ba = (\u03ba)A + (\u03ba)\u03bb + (\u03ba)X ,\n\n(A12)\n\nwhere (\u03ba)A is due to gauge bosons, (\u03ba)\u03bb is due to fermions and (\u03ba)X is due to scalars. In\neach case the retarded correlator can be written in the form of a phase space integral times\na matrix element squared The matrix elements are\n\u0002 \u0003\n|M|2A = N 2 Ep4 (1 + cos(\u03b8pp\u0304 ))2 (1 + cos2 (\u03b8pp\u0304 )) ,\n(A13)\n|M|2\u03bb = [4N 2 ] 4Ep4 (1 + cos(\u03b8pp\u0304 )) ,\n\n(A14)\n\n|M|2X\n\n(A15)\n\n= [6N\n\n2\n\n] Ep4 (1\n\n2\n\n+ cos \u03b8pp\u0304 ) .\n\nThen integrating over the phase-space we obtain the three contributions to \u03ba\n\u0012 4 \u0013\n5\nN\n2 64\u03c0\n\u03ba\n=\n[N\n]\nT9 ,\nc2T\n225\n\u0012 4 \u0013A\n5\nN\n2 254\u03c0\n\u03ba\n= [4N ]\nT9 ,\n2\nc\n135\n\u0012 T4 \u0013 \u03bb\n5\nN\n2 32\u03c0\n\u03ba\n=\n[6N\n]\nT9 .\nc2T\n135\nX\n\n(A16)\n(A17)\n(A18)\n\nThe final result for the momentum diffusion rate when only the stress tensor coupling is\nincluded is\n\u0012 4 \u0013\n5\nN\n2 6232\u03c0\n\u03ba\n=\nN\nT9 .\n(A19)\nc2T\n675\nSimilarly the mass shift for the meson in the finite temperature background is\n\u03b4M = (\u03b4M )A + (\u03b4M )\u03bb + (\u03b4M )X .\n\n(A20)\n\nThe different components of the mass shift are\n2 4\ncT\n2 \u03c0 T\n[2N\n]\n,\nN2\n30\ncT\n7 \u03c02T 4\n(\u03b4M )\u03bb = 2 [8N 2 ]\n,\nN\n8 30\ncT\n\u03c02T 4\n(\u03b4M )X = 2 [6N 2 ]\n.\nN\n30\n\n(\u03b4M )A =\n\n(A21)\n(A22)\n(A23)\n\nIn each case the \u03c0 2 T 4 /30 is the energy density of a massless single component bose gas. The\nfactor in square brackets counts the number of degrees of freedom (including spin) and a\nfactor of 7/8 to account for the differences between bose and fermi distributions.

It is useful to compare this\nexpectation to the strong coupling results as is done in the body of the text.\n\n[1] PHENIX Collaboration, A.
