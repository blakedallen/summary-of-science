In this paper, we give a sufficient condition such that the\nRicci flow in R2 exists globally and the flow converges at t = \u221e to the\nflat metric on R2 .\nMathematics Subject Classification 2000: 53Cxx,35Jxx\nKeywords: Ricci flow, maximum principle, convergence\n\n1. introduction\nIn this short note, we are interested in the long-term behavior on R2 of\nconformally flat solutions to the Ricci flow equation on R2 . Recall here that\nthe Ricci flow equation for the one-parameter family of metric g(t) on R2 is\n(1)\n\n\u2202t g = \u2212Rg, in R2 .\n\nFor these metrics g(t), we take their forms as g(x, t) = eu(x,t) gE , where gE is\nthe standard Euclidean metric on R2 . Then the Ricci flow equation becomes\n(2)\n\n\u2202t eu = \u2206u, in R2 ,\n\nwhere \u2206 is the standard Laplacian operator of the flat metric gE in R2 . The\nlong-term existence of solutions of (1) or (6) has been studied in [3], , where\nit is shown that\nTheorem 1. The solutions to (1) with initial metric g(0) = eu0 gE exist for\nall t \u2265 0 if and only if\nZ\neu0 dx = \u221e.\n(3)\nR2\n\nThe global behavior of the Ricci flow has been studied in [14]. To state\none of her result, we recall two concepts of the metric g = g(t). One is\nbelow.\nDefinition 2. The aperture of the metric g on R2 is defined as\nL(\u2202Br )\n1\nlim\n.\nA(g) =\n2\u03c0 r\u2192\u221e\nr\nHere Br denotes the geodesic ball (or disc) of radius r and L(\u2202Br ) is the\nlength of the boundary of \u2202Br .\nThe other is the Cheeger-Gromov convergence of the Ricci flow.\nThe research is partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of\nChina 10631020 and SRFDP 20090002110019.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nLI MA\n\nDefinition 3. The Ricci flow g(t) is said to have modified subsequence convergence, if there exists a 1-parameter family of diffeomorphisms {\u03c6(t)}tj \u22650\nsuch that for any sequence tj \u2192 \u221e, there exists a subsequence (denoted\nagain by tj ) such that the sequence \u03c6( tj )\u2217 g(tj ) converges uniformly on every compact set as tj \u2192 \u221e.\nThen we have the following result of L.F. Wu [14].\nTheorem 4. Let g(t) = eu(t) gE be a solution to (1.1) such that g(0) = eu0 gE\nis a complete metric with bounded curvature and \u2207u0 | is uniformly bounded\non R2 . Then the Ricci flow has modified subsequence convergence as tj \u2192 \u221e\nwith the limiting metric g\u221e being complete metric on R2 ; furthermore, the\nlimiting metric is flat if A(g(0) > 0.\nWe point out that the diffeomorphisms \u03c6(tj ) used in Theorem 4 are of\nthe special form\n\u03c6(t)(a, b) = (e\n\n\u2212u(x0 ,t)\n2\n\na, e\n\n\u2212u(x0 ,t)\n2\n\nb) = (x1 , x2 ) = x,\n\nwhere x0 = (0, 0). The important fact for these diffefeomorphisms is that\n|\u2207g(t) f (x, t)| = |\u2207\u03c6(t)\u2217 g(t) f ((a, b), t)|.\nfor any smooth function f and x = \u03c6(t)(a, b).\nIn the interesting paper [8], which motivates our work here, the authors\nhave proved the following.\nTheorem 5. Suppose g0 = eu0 gE has bounded curvature and u0 is a bounded\nsmooth function on R2 . Then the Ricci flow \u2202t g = \u2212Rg exists for all t \u2265\n0 and has modified subsequence convergence to the flat metric in the C k\ntopology of metrics on compact domains in R2 for each k \u2265 2.\nThere is another formulation in dimension two. Since every complete\nRiemannian manifold of dimension two is a one dimension K\u00e4hler manifold,\nwe can use the K\u00e4hler-Ricci flow formulation of the Ricci flow on R2 . We\nshall consider the Ricci flow (1) as the K\u00e4hler-Ricci flow by setting\ngij\u0304 = g0 ij\u0304 + \u2202i \u2202j\u0304 \u03c6,\nwhere \u03c6 = \u03c6(t) is the K\u00e4hler potential of the metric g(t) relative to the\nmetric g0 . Note that\ng(0)ij\u0304 = g0 ij\u0304 + \u2202i \u2202j\u0304 \u03c60 ,\nIn this situation, the Ricci flow can be written as\n(4)\n\n\u2202t \u03c6 = log\n\ng0 11\u0304 + \u03c611\u0304\n\u2212 f0 , \u03c6(0) = \u03c60 ,\ng0 11\u0304\n\nwhere f0 is the potential function of the metric g0 in the sense that R(g0 ) =\n\u2206g0 f0 in R2 . Here \u2206g0 = g011\u0304 \u22021 \u22021\u0304 in R2 , which is the normalized Laplacian in K\u00e4hler geometry. Such a potential function has been introduced by\n\n\fCONVERGENCE OF RICCI FLOW TO PLANE\n\n3\n\nR.Hamilton in [7]. We remark that the initial data for the evolution equation (4) is \u03c6(0) which is non-trivial. For the equivalent of these two flows,\none may see [1].\nOur result is below.\nTheorem 6. Suppose g0 = eu0 gE has bounded curvature R0 with (3) and\nf0 is a bounded smooth function on R2 such that \u2206g0 f0 = R0 . Then the\nRicci flow \u2202t g = \u2212Rg with the initial metric g0 exists for all t \u2265 0 and has\nmodified subsequence convergence to the flat metric in the C k topology of\nmetrics on compact domains in R2 for each k \u2265 2.\nWe remark that because of the assumption about the potential function\nf0 , the initial metric g0 is far from the cigar metric [9]. Here is the idea of\nthe proof. We shall show that the limit f\u221e of f (tj ) is a constant function.\nBecause of Theorem 4, we need only show that R(g\u221e ) = \u2206g\u221e f\u221e = 0. The\nproof of Theorem 6 will be given in section 3.\n2. maximum principle and the equivalence of flows (4) and (1)\nin dimension two\nFist we recall the maximum principle for the Ricci flow with bounded\ncurvature. Given the Ricci flow g(t) on R2 with bounded curvature, we\nhave the following well-known maximum principle.\nLemma 7. Fix any T > 0. If w(x, t) is a bounded smooth solution to the\nheat equation\n\u2202t w = \u2206g(t) w, R2 \u00d7 (0, T ]\nwith the bounded initial data w(x, 0), then |w(x, t)| \u2264 supR2 |w(x, 0)| for all\nt \u2208 (0, T ].\nWe now consider the equivalence of the flows (4) and (1) in dimension\ntwo. We use the argument in [1] (see Lemma 4.1 there). If g(t) is the Ricci\nflow in (1), we define\nZ t\ng (x, s)\nds \u2212 tf (0)\nlog 11\u0304\nu(x, t) =\ng\n0\n11\u0304 (x, 0)\nand\nS11\u0304 (x, t) = g11\u0304 (x, t) \u2212 g11\u0304 (x, 0) \u2212 u11\u0304 (x, t).\nThen by direct computation we have\ndS11\u0304 (x, t)\n= 0, S11\u0304 (x, 0) = 0.\ndt\nHence S11\u0304 (x, t) = 0 for all t > 0 and\ng11\u0304 (x, t) = g11\u0304 (x, 0) + u11\u0304 (x, t).\nIf u = u(x, t) is a solution to (4), then it is clear that\ng11\u0304 (x, t) = g11\u0304 (x, 0) + u11\u0304 (x, t)\nsatisfies (1).\n\n\f4\n\nLI MA\n\n3. proof of Theorem 6\nThe idea of the proof of Theorem 6 is similar to the argument in [2] and\n[8], see also [9].\nLet\nf = \u2212\u2202t \u03c6.\nThen, taking the time derivative of (4), we have\n(5)\n\n\u2202t f = \u2206g f, f (0) = \u2212\u2202t \u03c6(0) = f0 .\n\nBy Lemma 7 we know that f is uniformly bounded in R2 . The important\nfact for us is that\n(6)\n\n\u2206g f = R.\n\nSee [9] for a proof of this. if f0 has some decay at space infinity, one can\ncan the same decay by the argument of Dai-Ma [4].\nIt is well-known that R is uniformly bounded in any finite interval and\n|ft | and |\u2207f |2 are bounded for each t \u2265 0 (via the use of f (x, t) = f (x, 0) +\nintt0 R(x, s)ds).\nOur next task is to obtain a better control on |\u2207f | as t \u2192 \u221e. To get\nthis, we let\nF (x, t) = t|\u2207f |2 + f 2 .\nThen we have\n\u2202t F \u2264 \u2206g F, in R2 .\nUsing the maximum principle (Lemma 7), we know that\nsup |\u2207f (x, t)|2 \u2264\nx\u2208R2\n\nC\n1+t\n\nfor some uniform constant C > 0. Once we have this bound, we can follow\nthe argument in Lemmata 8,9,and 10 in [8] to conclude that the curvature\nbounds that there are uniform constants Ck , for any k \u2265 1, such that\n(7)\n\nsup |\u2207k R(x, t)|2 \u2264\nR2\n\nCk\n, t > 0.\n(1 + t)k+2\n\nWe are now ready to complete the proof of Theorem 6 Proof of Theorem\n6. We shall use the modified convergence sequence g(tj ) in Theorem 4. We\nneed only show that the limiting metric has flat curvature and this will be\nobtained by showing that the limiting function f\u221e of f (x, tj ) is constant.\nSince f (x, t) is uniformly bounded by a constant K > 0 on R2 \u00d7 [0, \u221e),\nfor the fixed x0 = (0, 0) \u2208 R2 and for any sequence tj \u2192 \u221e, there exists\na subsequence, still denoted by tj , such that c = lim f (x0 , tj ) exists. By\nthe construction of the metrics g(tj ), for any compact subset K \u2282 R2 , the\nlimiting metric g\u221e is equivalent to any \u03c6(tj )\u2217 g(tj ) for every large t; that is,\nthere is a uniform constant C = C(K) > 0 such that\ndt (x, x0 ) \u2264 Cdg\u221e (x, x0 )\n\n\fCONVERGENCE OF RICCI FLOW TO PLANE\n\n5\n\nfor every x \u2208 K, where dt (x, x0 ) is the distance between x and x0 in \u03c6(t)\u2217 g(t)\nand dg\u221e (x, x0 ) is the distance of the limiting metric.. For x \u2208 K, we can\nestablish (for all t > 1),\n|f (x, t) \u2212 f (x0 , t)| \u2264 dt (x, x0 ) sup |\u2207f (x, t)| \u2264\nx\u2208K\n\nCdg\u221e (x, x0 )\n,\n1+t\n\nwhere we have used the fact that for x = \u03c6(t)(a, b),\n|\u2207g(t) f (x, t)| = |\u2207\u03c6(t)\u2217 g(t) f ((a, b), t)|,\nwhich is uniformly bounded. It follows that f (x, tj ) is also convergent to c,\nwhich is f\u221e (x) = c as tj \u2192 \u221e, and then \u22021 \u22021\u0304 f (x, tj ) \u2192 0. Then we have\n\u2206g\u221e f\u221e = 0 = R\u221e and then \u03c6(tj )\u2217 g(tj ) \u2192 g\u221e locally in C 2 with g\u221e of flat\ncurvature. The C k -convergence of \u03c6(tj )\u2217 g(tj ) to this flat limit then follows\nfrom the previous curvature estimates obtained in (7) (see Lemmata 8,9,\nand 10 in [8]).
