W. Zerner3\nUniversity of Minnesota, Technion and Universit\u00e4t T\u00fcbingen\nWe construct forests that span Zd , d \u2265 2, that are stationary\nand directed, and whose trees are infinite, but for which the subtrees attached to each vertex are as short as possible. For d \u2265 3, two\nindependent copies of such forests, pointing in opposite directions,\ncan be pruned so as to become disjoint. From this, we construct in\nd \u2265 3 a stationary, polynomially mixing and uniformly elliptic environment of nearest-neighbor transition probabilities on Zd , for which\nthe corresponding random walk disobeys a certain zero\u2013one law for\ndirectional transience.\n\n1. Introduction. Let d \u2265 2 and let a : Zd \u2192 Zd be a random function for\nwhich x and a(x) are always nearest neighbors. If a(a(x)) 6= x for all x and\nthe set Fa = {{x, a(x)}|x \u2208 Zd } of edges defines a forest in Zd [i.e., the graph\n(Zd , Fa ) does not have cycles], we call such a random function a an ancestral\nfunction. In particular, if a is an ancestral function, then each connected\ncomponent of Fa is infinite and we can interpret a(x) as the parent or\nimmediate ancestor of x. The nth generation ancestor of x, n \u2265 1, is denoted\nby an (x) = a(an\u22121 (x)), where a0 (x) = x. Then, Ray(x) = {an (x)|n \u2265 0} is\nthe set of ancestors of x, including x itself, whereas Tree(x) = {y \u2208 Zd |x =\nan (y) for some n \u2265 1} is the set of progeny of x. The length of the longest\nbranch in Tree(x) is defined as\n(1)\n\nh(x) = sup{n \u2265 0|x = an (y) for some y \u2208 Zd },\n\nx \u2208 Zd .\n\nReceived January 2005; revised June 2005.\nSupported in part by NSF Grant DMS-02-26245.\n2\nSupported in part by NSF Grant DMS-03-02230.\n3\nMost of this paper was written while M.

ZERNER\n\nIn this paper, we study the tail behavior of h(0) for such forests Fa that\nare also stationary with respect to the translations of the lattice Zd [that\nis, the collection (a(x) \u2212 x)x\u2208Zd is stationary]. The proof of the following\ntheorem is easy.\nTheorem 1. There is a constant c1 > 0 that depends only on d \u2265 2,\nsuch that for all stationary ancestral functions (a(x))x\u2208Zd ,\n(2)\n\nlim inf nd\u22121 P[h(0) \u2265 n] \u2265 c1 .\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nHere and throughout the paper, P will denote the probability measure of\nthe underlying probability space. The corresponding expectation operator\nwill be denoted by E.\nAn ancestral function (a(x))x\u2208Zd is directed if for some z \u2208 {\u00b11}d , a(x) \u2212\nx \u2208 {zi ei |i = 1, . . . , d} for all x \u2208 Zd , P-a.s., where e1 , . . . , ed denote the standard basis vectors of Rd . We then refer to z as the direction of a (or of the\ncorresponding forest). Perhaps the simplest example of a stationary directed\nforest spanning Zd is given in the following example.\nExample 1. Define a(x) = x + i(x), where i(x), x \u2208 Zd , are independent\nrandom variables with P[i(x) = ej ] = 1/d for j = 1, . . . , d. This defines a\ndirected forest that spans Zd . Part of such a forest is shown in Figure 1(a), in\nd = 2. (It is not difficult to show that, in d = 2, the forest consists of a single\ntree, P-a.s.; see [9].) It follows from the discussion in [9], page 1730, that\nTree(0) is enclosed by two directed simple symmetric random walk paths\non the dual lattice that are independent of each other until they meet. So,\nP[h(0) \u2265 n] \u2265 c2 n\u22121/2 for some c2 > 0 and all n \u2265 1. (Neither this last fact\nnor Example 1 is used in the sequel, except as motivation.)\nExample 1 might suggest that trees in stationary spanning forests need\nto be longer than suggested in Theorem 1, that is, that the rate of decay\ngiven in Theorem 1 is not optimal. However, this is not the case, as is shown\nby the following result.\nTheorem 2. For each d \u2265 2, there is a stationary and directed ancestral\nfunction (a(x))x\u2208Zd that is polynomially mixing of order 1 and for which\n(3)\n\nlim sup nd\u22121 P[h(0) \u2265 n] < \u221e.\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nHere, we are using the following notion of mixing.\n\n\fTREES AND RANDOM WALKS IN RANDOM ENVIRONMENTS\n\n3\n\nDefinition 1. Let b = (b(y))y\u2208Zd be a family of random variables on\nsome common probability space. For G \u2282 Zd , define the collections of realvalued random variables\n(4) MbG = {f : |f | \u2264 1, f is measurable with respect to \u03c3(b(y), y \u2208 G)}.\n\nFor a given \u03b3 > 0, b is polynomially mixing (of order \u03b3) if for all finite\nG \u2282 Zd ,\nsup\n\nsup\n\ns\u2208Zd f \u2208MbG ,g\u2208MbG+s\n\n|s|\u03b3 | cov(f, g)| < \u221e.\n\nOur motivation for studying the above growth properties of random forests\nin Zd was our desire to investigate possible extensions of a conjectured 0\u20131\nlaw for random walk in a random environment (RWRE). We proceed to\nintroduce the RWRE model.\nFor d \u2265 1, let S denote the set of 2d-dimensional probability vectors and\nd\nset \u03a9 = S Z . We consider all \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9, written as \u03c9 = ((\u03c9(x, x + e))|e|=1 )x\u2208Zd ,\nas an environment for the random walk that we define next. The random\nwalk in the environment \u03c9, started at z \u2208 Zd , is the Markov chain (Xn )n\u22650\nwith state space Zd , such that X0 \u2261 z, and whose transition probabilities\nP\u03c9z satisfy\n(5) P\u03c9z (Xn+1 = x + e|Xn = x) = \u03c9(x, x + e)\n\nfor e \u2208 Zd with |e| = 1.\n\nAn environment \u03c9 is called elliptic if \u03c9(x, x + e) > 0 for all x, e \u2208 Zd with\n|e| = 1. A random environment \u03c9 is called uniformly elliptic if there exists\n\nFig. 1. (a) Example 1. (b) Part of the forest constructed for d = 2 in the proof of Theorem\n2.

(See [6] and [8] for an introduction to the RWRE\nmodel and its properties.)\nOne of the major open questions in the study of the RWRE concerns the\nso-called 0\u20131 law. Fix a vector l \u2208 Rd , l 6= 0, and define the events A+ (l)\nand A\u2212 (l) by\nA\u00b1 (l) =\n\n\u001a\n\n\u001b\n\nlim Xn * l = \u00b1\u221e .\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nIt has been known since the work of Kalikow [2] that if the random vectors\n\u03c9(x, *), x \u2208 Zd , are i.i.d. and \u03c9 is uniformly elliptic, then\nE[P\u03c90 [A+ (l) \u222a A\u2212 (l)]] \u2208 {0, 1}.\n\nThis was extended in [9], Proposition 3, to the elliptic i.i.d. case.\nThe 0\u20131 law conjecture for RWRE states that if \u03c9(x, *), x \u2208 Zd , are i.i.d.\nand \u03c9 is uniformly elliptic, then, in fact,\n(6)\n\nE[P\u03c90 [A+ (l)]] \u2208 {0, 1}.\n\n(The origin of this conjecture is a bit murky. For d = 1, it is a consequence\nof the law of large numbers in [5]. Kalikow [2] presented it as a question\nin d = 2; that case was settled only recently in the affirmative in [9]. The\nconjecture has since become folklore and is mentioned, e.g., in [7]. Although\nthe question has arisen whether (6) holds for elliptic i.i.d. environments or\nfor uniformly elliptic ergodic environments, we state the conjecture here in\nthe weaker form, that is, for uniformly elliptic i.i.d. environments. For d \u2265 3,\nthis is still an open problem.) Recently, it has been shown that the law of\nlarge numbers for the RWRE follows from (6) for i.i.d. environments [10],\nand for a class of Gibbsian environments [3].\nWhen d = 2 and the environment is elliptic and i.i.d., (6) was proved in [9],\nusing techniques that do not extend to higher dimensions. The same paper\nprovides an example, based on a construction of a forest that spans Z2 , of\nan elliptic, ergodic environment, where (6) fails. However, this environment\nis neither uniformly elliptic nor mixing (in the ergodic theoretic sense), and\nnot even totally ergodic, and thus the results in [9] do not contradict the\nvalidity of (6) for uniformly elliptic, mixing environments. (See [4], page 21,\nfor the definition of total ergodicity.)\nOur attempts to address the validity of (6) in this last setting led to the\ntree tail estimates discussed in Theorem 2. Employing these bounds, we\nconstruct a counterexample to (6), in d \u2265 3, with a stationary, uniformly\nelliptic and polynomially mixing environment.\nTheorem 3. For d \u2265 3, there is a probability space (with probability\nmeasure P) that supports a stationary, uniformly elliptic and polynomially\n\n\fTREES AND RANDOM WALKS IN RANDOM ENVIRONMENTS\n\n5\n\nmixing family \u03c9 = (\u03c9(x))x\u2208Zd , such that for some constant c > 0 and P-a.a.\nrealizations of \u03c9,\n(7)\n\n\u0014\n\nP\u03c90 lim inf\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n\u0015\n\nXn * ~1\n>c >0\nn\n\nand\n\n\u0014\n\nP\u03c90 lim inf\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n\u0015\n\nXn * (\u2212~1)\n> c > 0.\nn\n\nHere, ~1 = e1 + * * * + ed .\nWe outline how we use the spanning forest constructed in Theorem 2 to\nobtain Theorem 3. The counterexample in [9] was based on constructing\ntwo disjoint directed trees in Z2 with opposite directions z = ~1 and z = \u2212~1,\nand adjusting the transition probabilities of the RWRE on each edge that\nbelongs to one of the trees, so that the drift at x toward the ancestor a(x)\nincreases as a function of h(x). By appropriately choosing the rate at which\nthe drift increases, one can ensure that the RWRE, when started on one of\nthe trees, remains on it forever with positive probability, while progressing up\nits ancestral line. Because of this, the uniform ellipticity of the environment\ncannot be maintained.\nWhen trying to restore uniform ellipticity to the environment, a natural\nidea is to add \"insulation\" around each of the directed trees. The insulation should allow one to specify a uniformly elliptic environment that, with\npositive probability, forever traps the walker near the tree. Of course, this\nimplies that the insulation must grow as one progresses up the ancestral\nline. To leave room for two directed trees pointing in opposite directions\nto have nonoverlapping insulation, one needs for the trees not to be \"too\nlarge.\" When quantifying the notion of \"large\" needed, one is naturally led\nto study the random variable h(x) in (1).\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Theorems 1 and 2 are proved\nin Section 2. In Section 3 we prune the forest obtained in Theorem 2 to make\nroom for an independent copy of it with the direction z reversed and then add\ninsulation to be able to obtain uniform ellipticity of the environment of the\nRWRE later on. Geometric properties of insulated rays are investigated in\nSection 4. In Section 5 we equip each such insulated ray with an environment\n\u03c9 that traps the RWRE with positive probability. These environments are\npatched together in Section 6 to complete the proof of Theorem 3. After a\nshort discussion of open problems in Section 7, we prove in the Appendix\nthe mixing properties stated in Theorems 2 and 3.\nWe conclude the Introduction with some conventions and notation. The\np-norm, p \u2208 [1, \u221e] (on either Rd or Zd ), will be denoted by | * |p . Most of the\ntime, we will use the 1-norm, in which case we will drop the index 1 from\n| * |1 . The metric d(*, *) will always refer to | * |, and B(x, r) [resp. B\u221e (x, r)]\ndenotes the closed | * | ball (resp. | * |\u221e ball) of center x and radius r in\nZd . The collection of strictly positive integers will be denoted by N and the\n\n\f6\n\nM. BRAMSON, O. ZEITOUNI AND M. P. W. ZERNER\n\ncardinality of a set A will be denoted by #A. Throughout the paper, ci ,\ni = 1, 2, 3, . . . , will denote strictly positive and finite constants that depend\nonly on d and \u03b2, where \u03b2 is introduced in (24).\n2. Spanning Zd with short trees. In this section we provide the proofs\nof Theorems 1 and 2. We begin with the easy proof of Theorem 1.\nProof of Theorem 1.\n\nChoose c1 > 0 such that for all n \u2265 1,\n\nc1 #{x \u2208 Zd ||x| = n} \u2264 nd\u22121 .\n\nSince (a(x))x\u2208Zd is stationary, so is (h(x))x\u2208Zd and, therefore,\nnd\u22121 P[h(0) \u2265 n] \u2265 c1\n\n(8)\n\nX\n\n|x|=n\n\nP[h(x) \u2265 n]\n\nfor n \u2265 1.\n\nIf x is an ancestor of 0, then h(x) \u2265 |x|. Consequently, the right-hand side\nof (8) is at least\nc1\n\nX\n\n|x|=n\n\nP[x \u2208 Ray(0)] = c1 E[#{x \u2208 Ray(0)||x| = n}] \u2265 c1 ,\n\nwhere the inequality holds since Ray(0) contains at least one x with |x| = n.\nThe bound (2) follows. \u0003\nThe remainder of this section is devoted to demonstrating Theorem 2.\nWe begin with the construction of the ancestral function a referred to there.\nFix \u03b3d > 0 such that for all n \u2265 1,\n(9)\n\n#{x \u2208 Nd ||x| = n} \u2265 \u03b3d nd\u22121 .\n\nAlso, let n0 \u2208 N and \u03b8d be finite constants such that\n(10)\n\nnd0 \u2265 \u03b8d \u2265\n\ndd\n.\n\u03b3d\n\nLet L(x) > 1, x \u2208 Zd , be i.i.d. random variables whose distribution is atomless and satisfies\n(11)\n\nP [L(0) > t] = \u03b8d t\u2212d\n\nfor all t \u2265 n0 .\n\nWe define, for each t \u2265 1, the umbrella\nUt =\n\nd\n[\n\nUi,t ,\n\ni=1\n\nwhere\nUi,t = {x \u2208 [0, t]d |xi = 0, and xj > 0 for j 6= i},\n\ni = 1, . . . , d,\n\n\fTREES AND RANDOM WALKS IN RANDOM ENVIRONMENTS\n\n7\n\nFig. 2. Water will follow the thick line if there are no umbrellas around larger than the\nones shown.\n\nare the sides of the umbrella. Note that the umbrella Ut contains exactly\nthose points in Zd through which one can enter the box [1, t]d \u2229 Zd by moving\none step in one of the directions e1 , . . . , ed .\nWe next provide an informal description of the construction of the ancestral function a that captures our way of thinking. [The reader can safely\ndefer this discussion until after the precise definitions given in (12)\u2013(14).]\nImagine the ancestral line as being given by rainwater that always follows a\ndirected nearest-neighbor flow on Zd . Rain is leaving each lattice point in all\nof the positive coordinate directions and is being deflected by the umbrellas\ny + UL(y) , y \u2208 Zd . The umbrellas will protect most of the points in the cubes\ny + [1, L(y)]d from the rain, as follows. Water that has reached a vertex x is\nblocked from flowing to x+ ei by any umbrella whose side y + Ui,L(y) contains\nx. However, for every direction e1 , . . . , ed , there is an umbrella whose side\ny + Ui,L(y) \u220b x blocks that direction. This \"battle\" is lost by the direction ei\nfor which the largest umbrella in x blocking that direction is smallest among\nall directions, and the water will flow in this direction. (See Figure 2 for an\nillustration in d = 2. Note that the topological duality present for d = 2 is\nabsent for d \u2265 3.)\nMore precisely, we define, for all i = 1, . . . , d and all x \u2208 Zd ,\n(12)\n\n\u03bbi (x) =\n\nsup\ny\u2208Zd : x\u2208y+Ui,L(y)\n\nL(y),\n\n\f8\n\nM. BRAMSON, O. ZEITOUNI AND M. P. W. ZERNER\n\nwhich is the length of the largest umbrella whose i side passes through\nx. Since L(0) > 1 a.s., we have x \u2208 x \u2212 ej + Ui,L(x\u2212ej ) a.s., for each j 6= i.\nConsequently, the set on the right-hand side of (12) is nonempty and \u03bbi (x)\nis greater than 1. The following lemma implies that \u03bbi (x) is also a.s. finite.\nLemma 4.\nt > n0 ,\n\nThere is a constant c3 , such that for all i \u2208 {1, . . . , d} and all\nP[\u03bbi (0) > t] \u2264 c3 t\u22121 .\n\n(13)\n\nProof. It suffices to show that (13) holds for t large. Let t1 > n0 be\nd\nchosen large enough so that (1 \u2212 \u03b8d t\u2212d )t /\u03b8d > 1/3 for t > t1 . Set\nDin = {y \u2208 Zd ||y|\u221e = n, yi = 0, yj < 0 for all j 6= i}.\n\nBy the definition of \u03bbi (x) and the independence of L(y), y \u2208 Zd , one obtains\nfor t > t1 , that\nP[\u03bbi (0) \u2264 t] = P[L(y) \u2264 t for all y \u2208 \u2212Ui,t ]\n(11)\n\nd\u22121\n\n\u2265 (1 \u2212 \u03b8d t\u2212d )\u230at\u230b\n\n\u2265 3\u2212\u03b8d /t\u2212\n\nP\n\nc n\nn>t 5\n\nY\n\nY\n\nn>t\n\nP[L(y) < n for all y \u2208 Din ]\n\n(1 \u2212 \u03b8d n\u2212d )c4 n\n\nd\u22122\n\nn>t\n\u22122\n\n\u22121\n\n\u2265 3\u2212c6 t\n\n\u2265 1 \u2212 c3 t\u22121\n\nfor appropriate constants c3 , . . . , c6 . \u0003\nSince the distributions of \u03bbi (x) and L(x) are atomless, there is an a.s.\nunique I(x) \u2208 {1, . . . , d}, for which\n\u03bbI(x) (x) = min{\u03bbi (x)|i = 1, . . . , d}.\nThis defines a direction with the smallest \"protecting\" umbrellas. Any umbrella passing through x that is perpendicular to that direction will be penetrated at that site, in the sense that water will flow from x in that direction.\nWe now set, for x \u2208 Zd ,\n(14)\n\na(x) = x + eI(x) .\n\nNote that since a is directed with z = ~1, a is an ancestral function; this is\nthe ancestral function we will use to demonstrate Theorem 2. The edges\n{x, a(x)}, x \u2208 Zd , that are \"wetted by the rain\" define a random forest of\ninfinite trees that spans Zd [as in Figure 1(b) for d = 2].\nWe still need to demonstrate the tail estimates and mixing properties\nin the statement of Theorem 2. As a first step, the next lemma bounds the\nprobability that an umbrella, with side length at least t, has been penetrated\nat any given site.\n\n\f9\n\nTREES AND RANDOM WALKS IN RANDOM ENVIRONMENTS\n\nLemma 5.\nUi,t ,\n(15)\n\nFor some constant c7 and all i \u2208 {1, . . . , d}, t > n0 and z \u2208\nP[I(z) = i, L(0) > t] \u2264 c7 t\u22122d+1 .\n\nProof. Denote by Ai (z) the \u03c3-field generated by the random variables\nL(u), with ui = zi and uj 6= zj for all j 6= i. Note that Ai (z), i = 1, . . . , d, are\nindependent. Moreover, \u03bbi (z) is measurable with respect to Ai (z), and L(0)\nis measurable with respect to Ai (z) if z \u2208 Ui,n . Therefore, for i = 1, . . . , d\nand z \u2208 Ui,n ,\n\u0014 \u0014\n\n\u0015\n\nP[I(z) = i, L(0) > t] = E P \u03bbi (z) < min \u03bbj (z) Ai (z) ; L(0) > t\n=E\n\n\"\n\nY\n\nj6=i\n\n#\n\n\u0015\n\nP[\u03bbi (z) < \u03bbj (z)|Ai (z)]; L(0) > t .\n\nj6=i\n\nBy (13) (for the first inequality), and by (11) and the independence of\n(L(x))x (for the second inequality), this is\n\u2264 E[(c3 \u03bbi (z)\u22121 )d\u22121 ; L(0) > t] \u2264 c7 t\u2212(d\u22121)\u2212d ,\nbecause L(0) > t implies \u03bbi (z) > t. \u0003\nWe can now demonstrate Theorem 2.\nProof of Theorem 2. It remains to show that the ancestral function\n(a(x))x constructed above is polynomially mixing of order 1 and satisfies the\nbound in (3). Here, we demonstrate (3); the demonstration of polynomial\nmixing is deferred to Lemma A.1 in the Appendix. (The lemma in fact deals\nwith a slightly stronger notion of mixing.)\nWe begin the proof of (3) by introducing some notation. Denote by\nn\nSm\n= {x \u2208 Zd |m \u2264 x * ~1 \u2264 n},\n\nm, n \u2208 Z,\n\nthe slab bounded by the hyperplanes perpendicular to ~1 and passing through\nm~1 and n~1.

Also, set\nn,+\nn\nSm\n= Sm\n\u2229 Nd ,\n\nn,\u2212\nn\nSm\n= Sm\n\u2229 \u2212Nd .\n\nWe define the random variables\n(16)\n\n\u2212m,\u2212\nMn = sup{m \u2208 {n0 , . . . , n}|\u2203 x \u2208 S\u2212m\nwith L(x) > m},\n\nwhere we set Mn = n0 \u2212 1 if the set in (16) is empty.\nWe will show that\n(17)\n\nP[h(0) > m, Mn = m] \u2264 c8 n\u2212d ,\n\nm = n0 \u2212 1, . . . , n.\n\nn \u2265 1,\n\n\f10\n\nM.

The proof of (17) is divided into the degenerate case,\nm = n0 \u2212 1, and the general case, m = n0 , . . . , n, which involves considerably\nmore work.\nWe first consider the case m = n0 \u2212 1. Then, there is no umbrella y + UL(y) ,\nwith n0 \u2264 |y| \u2264 n, that protects the origin. Therefore,\nP[h(0) > m, Mn = n0 \u2212 1]\n\u2264 P[Mn = n0 \u2212 1]\n\n\u2212m,\u2212\n= P[for all m = n0 , . . . , n and y \u2208 S\u2212m\n, L(y) \u2264 m]\n\n(11)\n\n=\n\nn \u0012\nY\n\n\u03b8d\n1\u2212 d\nm\n\nm=n0\n\n\u0013#S \u2212m,\u2212 (9) Y\nn \u0012\n\u2212m\n\n\u2264\n\nm=n0\n\n\u03b8d\n1\u2212 d\nm\n\n\u0013(md /\u03b8d )(\u03b3d \u03b8d /m)\n\n.\n\nSince (1 \u2212 x\u22121 )x \u2264 e\u22121 for x \u2265 1, the last expression is, by (10) and (11), at\nmost\n(18)\n\nd\n\nexp \u2212d\n\nn\nX\n\nm\n\nm=n0\n\n\u22121\n\n!\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2264 exp \u2212dd\n\nZ\n\nn\n\nn0\n\n\u0013\n\nx\u22121 dx \u2264 c10 n\u2212d\n\nfor appropriate c10 . This implies (17) for m = n0 \u2212 1 if one takes c8 \u2265 c10 .\nWe now demonstrate (17) for the general case m = n0 , . . . , n. We will\nemploy the events\nn\nAnm (x, r) = {L(y) \u2264 \u2212y * ~1 + r for all y \u2208 Sm\n\u2229 (x \u2212 Nd )},\n\nm, n, r \u2208 Z, x \u2208 Zd .\n\nSince the proof is long, we break it into three parts.

For the remainder of the paper, we will\nconsider arbitrary ancestral functions (a(x))x\u2208Zd that satisfy the statement\nof Theorem 2. Eventually, when studying mixing properties (in the proof of\nTheorem 3 and in the Appendix), we will need to use the explicit construction of ancestral functions provided in Section 2.\nIn this section we prune the trees constructed in Theorem 2, with an eye\ntoward the construction of an environment for the RWRE. This will allow\nus to build wide enough channels to trap the random walker and direct it in\ncertain chosen directions. Throughout the remainder of the paper, we will\nassume d \u2265 3 and employ a constant \u03b2 that satisfies\n\nd\u22122\n.\n2d\n(This bound is needed for the construction of the environment. To guarantee\nits mixing properties, we will eventually take \u03b2 small enough so that the\nconclusion of Lemma A.5 in the Appendix holds.)\nFor each y \u2208 Zd , we consider the ball B(y, h(y)\u03b2 ), where h is defined in\n(1). (Such balls will serve as the \"insulation\" alluded to in the Introduction.)\nAny given x \u2208 Zd may be covered by a number of balls: we set\n(24)\n\n0<\u03b2<\n\nH(x) = sup{h(y)|x \u2208 B(y, h(y)\u03b2 )}.\n\n(25)\n\nWe first estimate the tail behavior of H(0).\nLemma 6.\n(26)\n\nFor appropriate c17 ,\nlim sup n(1\u2212\u03b2)d\u22121 P[H(0) \u2265 n] \u2264 c17 < \u221e.\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nProof.

This implies (26). \u0003\nRecall that Theorem 2 guarantees the existence of a directed stationary\nforest with certain specific properties. By relabeling the coordinate axes,\nwe can choose the directions in which the rays of this forest grow, that\nis, we can specify z \u2208 {\u00b11}d such that, for each x \u2208 Zd , a(x) \u2212 x \u2208 {zi ei |i =\n1, . . . , d}. We may therefore assume that there exist, on the same probability\nspace, two independent directed forests, Fi = {{x, ai (x)}|x \u2208 Zd }, i = 1, 2,\nwith ancestral functions ai , such that a1 (x) \u2212 x = ej for some j = 1, . . . , d and\na2 (x) \u2212 x = \u2212ej for some j = 1, . . . , d. These two forests \"grow\" in opposite\ndirections ~1 and \u2212~1. We define the corresponding functions hi and Hi in the\nsame way as above, using their respective forests Fi .\nWe proceed to \"prune\" the trees in both forests in such a way that each\npruned forest will consist solely of infinite trees, and these forests will be\n\"well separated.\" (The forests will no longer span Zd .) To this end, we\ndefine, for (i, j) = (1, 2), (2, 1),\ne i = {x \u2208 Zd |hi (x) > Hj (y) for y \u2208 B(x, hi (x)\u03b2 )}.\nT\n\ne i .

BRAMSON, O. ZEITOUNI AND M. P. W. ZERNER\n\nProposition 7. The sets B1 and B2 are a.s. disjoint. There exist a.s.\nNi \u2208 N, i = 1, 2, such that ani (0) \u2208 Ti for all n \u2265 Ni . In particular, Bi 6= \u2205\na.s.\nProof. To prove the disjointness of B1 and B2 , assume instead that x \u2208\nB1 \u2229 B2 . Then there exist x1 \u2208 T1 and x2 \u2208 T2 so that x \u2208 B(xi , hi (xi )\u03b2 ) for\ni = 1, 2. Since x \u2208 B(x1 , h1 (x1 )\u03b2 ), one has H1 (x) \u2265 h1 (x1 ). Moreover, since\ne 2 and x \u2208 B(x2 , h2 (x2 )\u03b2 ), one has H1 (x) < h2 (x2 ) by the definition\nx2 \u2208 T\nof T2 . Consequently, h2 (x2 ) > h1 (x1 ). Analogously, one obtains h1 (x1 ) >\nh2 (x2 ), which is a contradiction and proves B1 \u2229 B2 = \u2205.\nWe will next show that\ne i for some n \u2265 k] < \u221e,\n(28) lim sup k(1\u22122\u03b2)d\u22122 P[ani (0) \u2208\n/T\n\ni = 1, 2,\n\nk\u2192\u221e\n\nwhich implies the second claim since, by (24), (1 \u2212 2\u03b2)d \u2212 2 > 0. To demonstrate (28), let k \u2265 0 and (i, j) = (1, 2) or (i, j) = (2, 1).

Moreover, Hj is measurable with respect to \u03c3(aj (x), x \u2208\nZd ), which is independent of \u03c3(ai (x), x \u2208 Zd ). Hence, we can use Lemma 6\nto estimate each such term from above and obtain that (29) is at most\nX\n\nn\u2265k\n\nE[c19 hi (ani (0))1\u2212(1\u22122\u03b2)d ] \u2264\n\nX\n\nc19 n1\u2212(1\u22122\u03b2)d\n\nn\u2265k\n\nfor appropriate c19 , since hi (ani (0)) \u2265 n. Since 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 2\u03b2)d < \u22121 by (24),\ninequality (28) follows. \u0003\nSince they are subsets of Fi , the sets \u03a0i = {(x, ai (x))|x \u2208 Ti }, i = 1, 2, are\nalso forests. By Proposition 7, they almost surely contain infinite rays that\npoint in opposite directions and they do not have any vertices in common.\nMoreover, the set of immediate ancestors of vertices in Ti is contained in\nBi , because, for any x \u2208 Ti , hi (x) \u2265 1 [since Hj (x) \u2265 0] and hence ai (x) \u2208\nB(x, hi (x)\u03b2 ). Consequently, no vertex in \u03a01 is connected to a vertex in \u03a02\nand so \u03a01 \u222a \u03a02 is also a forest (although it does not span all of Zd ).

Set n = (\u22121)i+1 (x \u2212 z) * ~1; n \u2265 0 since\nRay(z) is directed. Moreover, we may assume n \u2265 1, because n = 0 implies\nthat x = z, in which case uz (x) = 0 and (38) is trivial.\n\n\fTREES AND RANDOM WALKS IN RANDOM ENVIRONMENTS\n\n19\n\nWe introduce a vector w 6= 0, as follows.

In this section we construct, for every insulated ray InsRay(z), z \u2208 \u2202T1 \u222a \u2202T2 , a uniformly elliptic\nenvironment that forever traps the walk {Xn } inside InsRay(z) with positive\nprobability. This is achieved by both \"pushing\" the walk toward Ray(z) and\nin a direction parallel to Ray(z) in which InsRay(z) widens. Proposition 7\nis the main result of the section; most of the work is done in Lemmas 10\nand 11.\nThese two directions are determined as follows, for any x \u2208 InsRay(z).\nThe parallel motion of the walk consists of jumping from x to x + rz (x),\nwhere\n(44)\n\nrz (x) = \u03b1nz (x)+1 (z) \u2212 \u03b1nz (x) (z)\n\nand nz (x) is given by (35).

For x \u2208\nRay(z), the choice of the unit vector sz (x) is arbitrary.

Both use Azuma's\ninequality [1], a version of which we recall in Lemma 9.\n\n\f22\n\nM. BRAMSON, O. ZEITOUNI AND M. P. W. ZERNER\n\nLemma 9 (Azuma's inequality). For every b1 , b2 \u2208 (0, \u221e), there exist\nb3 , b4 , b5 \u2208 (0, \u221e) so that the following holds. If (Yn )n\u22650 is a sequence of\nrandom variables on a probability space with measure P and expectation E,\nand \u03c4 is a ( possibly infinite) stopping time w.r.t. that sequence such that\nP -a.s., Y0 = 0, |Yn+1 \u2212 Yn | \u2264 b1 and\n(49)\n\nE[Yn+1 \u2212 Yn |\u03c3(Ym , m \u2264 n)] \u2265 b2\n\non the event {n < \u03c4 },\n\nthen\nP [Yn < b3 n, n \u2264 \u03c4 ] \u2264 b4 e\u2212b5 n\n\nfor all n \u2265 0.\n\nLemma 10 will be used in the proof of Lemma 11.\nLemma 10. For appropriate c23 , c24 and c25 , and all i \u2208 {1, 2}, z \u2208 \u2202Ti ,\nx \u2208 InsRay(z) and n \u2265 0, P-a.s.,\n(50)\n\nP\u03c9xz [(\u22121)i+1 (Xn \u2212 x) * ~1 < c23 n, Tz \u2265 n] \u2264 c24 e\u2212c25 n\n\nand\nP\u03c9xz [Tz = n < \u03c41 ] \u2264 c24 e\u2212c25 (uz (x)\u2228n) .\n\n(51)\n\nRoughly speaking, (50) says that the speed of the walk is bounded below in the direction (\u22121)i+1~1, as long as the walk remains in InsRay(z),\nwhereas (51) bounds the probability of leaving InsRay(z)\\ Ray(z) through\nthe boundary of InsRay(z).\nProof of Lemma 10. Set Fn = \u03c3(Xk , k \u2264 n). To demonstrate (50), it\nsuffices to verify that Yn = (\u22121)i+1 (Xn \u2212 x) * ~1 satisfies the assumptions of\nAzuma's inequality, Lemma 9, with P = P\u03c9xz and \u03c4 = Tz . Except for (49),\nall assumptions are obviously satisfied, with b1 = 1. The bound (49) is also\nsatisfied since, on the event {Tz > n},\nE\u03c9xz [(\u22121)i+1 (Xn+1 \u2212 Xn ) * ~1|Fn ]\n\n(52)\n\n=\n\nX\n\n(\u22121)i+1 \u03c9 z (Xn , Xn + e)e * ~1\n\ne\u2208Zd ,|e|=1\n\n\u2265 (\u22121)i+1 43 rz (Xn ) * ~1 \u2212\n\nX\n\ne6=rz (Xn )\n\n\u03c9 z (Xn , Xn + e) =\n\n3\n4\n\n\u2212\n\n1\n4\n\n> 0.\n\nWe now demonstrate (51). Since (Xn )n is a nearest-neighbor walk, Tz \u2265\nuz (x) and so the statement is trivial for n < uz (x). Set Yn = vz (Xn ) \u2212 vz (x).\nFor n \u2265 uz (x) on {Tz = n < \u03c41 }, Xn \u2208\n/ InsRay(z), and so by (34), Yn \u2264\nuz (Xn ) = 0.\n\n\fTREES AND RANDOM WALKS IN RANDOM ENVIRONMENTS\n\n23\n\nWe first consider x \u2208 InsRay(z)\\ Ray(z). For (51) it suffices to check (49)\nin Azuma's inequality, with \u03c4 = \u03c41 \u2227 Tz and P = P\u03c9xz , since the other assumptions are obviously satisfied. For this we consider y \u2208 InsRay(z)\\ Ray(z) and\nestimate the value of vz at the nearest neighbors of y in terms of vz (y). For\nthe increment rz (y),\n(33)\nvz (y + rz (y)) \u2265 (nz (y) + 1)\u03b2 \u2212 |y + rz (y) \u2212 \u03b1nz (y)+1 (z)|\n(44)\n\n\u2265 nz (y)\u03b2 \u2212 |y \u2212 \u03b1nz (y) (z)| = vz (y).\n\nTherefore, moving from y to y + rz (y), which occurs in the environment \u03c9 z\nwith probability at least 3/4, does not decrease vz . Similarly,\n(33)\nvz (y + sz (y)) \u2265 nz (y)\u03b2 \u2212 |y + sz (y) \u2212 \u03b1nz (y) (z)|\n(46)\n\n\u2265 nz (y)\u03b2 \u2212 (|y \u2212 \u03b1nz (y) (z)| \u2212 1) = vz (y) + 1;\n\nsince a walker at y moves with probability at least 1/5 to y + sz , vz increases\nby 1 with probability at least 1/5. With probability 1/20, the walker moves\nto one of its other neighbors; when doing so, vz can decrease by at most 1\ndue to (36). Therefore,\n(53)\n\nE\u03c9xz [Yn+1 \u2212 Yn |Fn ] \u2265 1/5 \u2212 1/20 > 0\n\nfor any n \u2265 0 on the event {n < \u03c41 \u2227 Tz }, which implies (49) and hence (51)\nfor x \u2208 InsRay(z)\\ Ray(z).\nOn the other hand, for x \u2208 Ray(z) and n = 0, (51) is trivial. For x \u2208 Ray(z)\nand n > 0,\nP\u03c9xz [Tz = n < \u03c41 ] =\n\nX\n\ny\u2208Zd \\Ray(z) : |x\u2212y|=1\n\n\u03c9 z (x, y)P\u03c9yz [Tz = n \u2212 1 < \u03c41 ]\n\nand we can apply the bound (51) already proved for y \u2208 InsRay(z)\\ Ray(z)\nto obtain (51) in this case, with a new choice of c24 . \u0003\nInequality (55) is the main result we will need for the proof of Proposition\n12. It follows quickly from (54), which is an analog of (51), but without the\nrestriction on not hitting Ray(z) before exiting InsRay(z).\nLemma 11. For appropriate c26 , c27 , c28 and c29 , and all i \u2208 {1, 2}, z \u2208\n\u2202Ti , x \u2208 InsRay(z), and n \u2265 0,\n(54)\nand\n(55)\n\n\u03b2\n\nP\u03c9xz [Tz = n] \u2264 c26 e\u2212c27 (uz (x)\u2228n ) ,\n\nP-a.s.\n\u03b2\n\nE\u03c9xz [Tz ; n < Tz < \u221e] \u2264 c28 e\u2212c29 (uz (x)\u2228n ) ,\n\nP-a.s.\n\n\f24\n\nM. BRAMSON, O. ZEITOUNI AND M. P. W. ZERNER\n\nProof. By symmetry, we may assume i = 1. We will demonstrate (54)\nby a union bound with four events. Choose kn so that \u03c4kn \u2264 n < \u03c4kn +1 and\nset \u03ben = (x \u2212 z) * ~1 + c23 n, where c23 is as in Lemma 10. Since x \u2208 InsRay(z),\n\u03ben > 0. One can then check that\nP\u03c9xz [Tz = n] \u2264 I + II + III + IV,\nwhere\nI = P\u03c9xz [(Xn \u2212 x) * ~1 < c23 n, Tz = n],\n\nII = P\u03c9xz [Tz = n < \u03c41 ],\n\nIII = P\u03c9xz [\u03c41 < Tz = n, n \u2212 \u03c4kn \u2265 \u03ben\u03b2 /2],\n\nIV = P\u03c9xz [(Xn \u2212 x) * ~1 \u2265 c23 n, \u03c41 < Tz = n, n \u2212 \u03c4kn < \u03ben\u03b2 /2].\n\nIn words, the event in I occurs when, by the time n at which the walk exits\nInsRay(z), it has not moved to a much wider part of InsRay(z). The event\nin II occurs when, by that time n, the walk has not hit Ray(z). The event\nin III occurs when, by that time n, the walk has hit Ray(z), but the elapsed\ntime since last visiting Ray(z) is large. The event in IV occurs when, by that\ntime n, the walk has hit Ray(z), the elapsed time since last visiting Ray(z)\nis not large and the walk has moved to a much wider part of InsRay(z).\nWe will show that each of these four terms has an upper bound of the form\nin (54). The bounds for I and II follow directly from Lemma 10, while those\nfor III and IV require some additional work. For I, note that from (50) and\nTz \u2265 uz (x), it follows that I \u2264 c24 e\u2212c25 (uz (x)\u2228n) , which is a stronger bound\nthan required. The same is true for the estimate of II provided by (51). We\nnext bound III. Since \u03c4k is the time of the kth visit to Ray(z), \u03c4k \u2265 k for all\nk \u2265 0.

We argue by contradiction; on the event in IV,\n(58)\n\n(34)\n(36)\n0 = uz (XTz ) \u2265 vz (XTz ) \u2265 vz (X\u03c4kn ) \u2212 (n \u2212 \u03c4kn ).\n\nSince \u03c41 < n, we have kn \u2265 1 and therefore X\u03c4kn \u2208 Ray(z). Because of (45),\nX\u03c4kn = \u03b1m (z), where m = nz (X\u03c4kn ) = (X\u03c4kn \u2212 z) * ~1. So, on the event considered in IV,\nvz (X\u03c4kn )1/\u03b2 = (X\u03c4kn \u2212 z) * ~1\n= (X\u03c4kn \u2212 Xn ) * ~1 + (Xn \u2212 x) * ~1 + (x \u2212 z) * ~1\n\n\u2265 \u03c4kn \u2212 n + \u03ben .\n\nSubstituting this into (58) and using n \u2212 \u03c4kn \u2264 \u03ben\u03b2 /2, we get\n\n0 \u2265 (\u03ben \u2212 \u03ben\u03b2 /2)\u03b2 \u2212 \u03ben\u03b2 /2 \u2265 (\u03ben \u2212 \u03ben /2)\u03b2 \u2212 \u03ben\u03b2 /2 = (2\u2212\u03b2 \u2212 2\u22121 )\u03ben\u03b2 > 0,\n\nwhich is a contradiction, so, IV = 0 and we have demonstrated\n(54).\nP\nTo obtain (55), note that the left-hand side equals l>n lP\u03c9xz [Tz = l].

Patching environments attached to insulated rays. In this section we\nprove Theorem 3 by constructing an appropriate random environment \u03c9.\nThe main idea behind the construction of \u03c9 is to choose, for any point\nx \u2208 Ci , among all environments attached to insulated rays covering x, the\none that \"minimizes the probability of exiting the ray.\" To make this choice\nlocally and thus not destroy the mixing properties inherited by the trees Ti\nwe have constructed, a slight modification of this idea is actually needed.\nThis is done by minimizing the expectations of exit times from the insulated\nrays (on the event they are finite).\nFor x \u2208 C1 \u222a C2 , we set Z(x) = {z \u2208 \u2202T1 \u222a \u2202T2 |x \u2208 InsRay(z)} and denote\nby z(x) a leaf z \u2208 Z(x) that minimizes Ez (x). (We apply some arbitrary rule,\ne.g., lexicographic order, to break ties.) Using this, we define, for x, e \u2208 Zd\nwith |e| = 1,\n(62)\n\n\u03c9(x, x + e) =\n\n\u001a\n\n\u03c9 z(x) (x, x + e),\n(2d)\u22121 ,\n\nif x \u2208 C1 \u222a C2 ,\notherwise,\n\n\fTREES AND RANDOM WALKS IN RANDOM ENVIRONMENTS\n\n27\n\nwhere \u03c9 z is given by (47). Note that \u03c9 inherits the uniform ellipticity of the\nenvironments \u03c9 z , with ellipticity constant \u03ba given above (48). Moreover, for\nx \u2208 C1 \u222a C2 , we set\nE(x) = Ez(x) (x),\n\n\u221e\nE \u221e (x) = Ez(x)\n(x)\n\nand p(x) = pz(x) (x).\n\nBecause of (60), we will find it useful to employ the stopping time\n\u03c3 = inf{n \u2265 0|E(Xn ) \u2265 \u03ba}.\nThe next lemma is the reason for our choice of the environment \u03c9 in (62).\n\nLemma 13. For all x \u2208 C1 \u222a C2 , the sequence (Yn )n\u22650 given by Yn =\nE(X\u03c3\u2227n ) is a supermartingale under P\u03c9x with respect to the filtration Fn =\n\u03c3(Xk , k \u2264 n), n \u2265 0.\nProof. Suppose x \u2208 C1 \u222a C2 . If E(x) \u2265 \u03ba, then \u03c3 = 0 and the statement\nis trivial. So, we can assume that E(x) < \u03ba. For y \u2208 C1 \u222a C2 with E(y) < \u03ba,\n(61)\n\u221e\nE(y) = Ez(y) (y) \u2265 Ez(y)\n(y) \u2212 pz(y) (y)\n\n= E\u03c9y z(y) [1 + (Tz(y) \u2212 1); Tz(y) < \u221e] \u2212 pz(y) (y)\n\n\u221e\n1\n\u2265 E\u03c9y z(y) [E\u03c9Xz(y)\n[Tz(y) ; Tz(y) < \u221e]] = E\u03c9y z(y) [Ez(y)\n(X1 )]\n(61)\n\n\u2265 E\u03c9y z(y) [Ez(y) (X1 )].\n\nBecause of E(y) < \u03ba and (60), d(y, InsRay(z(y))c ) > 1. Since the walk is\nnearest neighbor, this implies that X1 \u2208 InsRay(z(y)) and, hence, by the\ndefinition of z(X1 ), Ez(y) (X1 ) \u2265 Ez(X1 ) (X1 ). Therefore,\n(63)\n\n(62)\nE(y) \u2265 E\u03c9y z(y) [Ez(y) (X1 )] \u2265 E\u03c9y z(y) [Ez(X1 ) (X1 )] = E\u03c9y [E(X1 )].\n\nWe need to show E\u03c9x [Yn+1 |Fn ] \u2264 Yn . For this, observe that on the event\n{\u03c3 \u2264 n} \u2208 Fn , trivially Yn+1 = Yn , whereas on the event {\u03c3 > n}, by the\nMarkov property,\n(63)\nE\u03c9x [Yn+1 |Fn ] = E\u03c9x [E(Xn+1 )|Fn ] = E\u03c9Xn [E(X1 )] \u2264 E(Xn ) = Yn .\n\nThis completes the proof of the lemma. \u0003\nWe now prove that with positive probability, the random walk (Xn )n\ndefined by the environment in (62) remains in Ci forever.\n\n\f28\n\nM.

For i = 1, 2, pick an arbitrary z \u2208 \u2202Ti and set x = \u03b1n (z) \u2208\nRay(z), where n is large enough so that\n\u03b2\n\nc28 e\u2212c29 n < \u03ba\n\n(65)\n\nfor c28 and c29 chosen as in Lemma 11.

On the other hand, by (60),\non the event {\u03c3 = \u221e}, one has d(Xn , Cic ) \u2265 1 for all n. Therefore, (64) holds.\n\u0003\nWe now present the proof of Theorem 3.\nProof of Theorem 3. Define \u03c9 as in (62), with \u03b2 satisfying (24).\n[Recall that \u03b2 was used throughout the construction of \u03c9, beginning with\n(25).] By construction, \u03c9 is stationary and is uniformly elliptic, with ellipticity constant at least \u03ba = (20(2d \u2212 1))\u22121 . By Lemma A.5 in the Appendix,\none can choose \u03b2 > 0 small enough so that \u03c9 is polynomially mixing.\nLet (Xn )n be the RWRE on this environment.

Open problems. In this brief section, we mention several open problems. The first involves random forests in Zd built from ancestral functions\nand is motivated by the upper bound in Theorem 2.\nWhat is the optimal constant c1 in the lower bound\n\nOpen problem 1.\n(2) of Theorem 1?\n\nThere are several natural questions involving RWRE.\nOpen problem 2. Does the statement of Theorem 3 continue to hold\nin d = 2? If it does, what are the mixing assumptions on the environment\nthat imply the 0\u20131 law (6)? (Recall that the 0\u20131 law for i.i.d. environments\nis proved in [9].)\nAs mentioned in the Introduction, the following question is still open.\nOpen problem 3. Prove the 0\u20131 law (6) for i.i.d. uniformly elliptic\nenvironments, when d \u2265 3.\nAPPENDIX\nWe deferred the demonstration of mixing properties used in the paper\nto the Appendix; a weaker form of Lemma A.1 was used in the proof of\nTheorem 2, and Lemma A.5 was used in the proof of Theorem 3. Here, we\ndemonstrate Lemmas A.1 and A.5, and the intermediate Lemmas A.2\u2013A.4\nthat are used in the proof of Lemma A.5.\nWe need to extend the notion of polynomial mixing that was introduced\nin Definition 1, by allowing the set G there to grow with s. We will employ\nthe notation MbG introduced in (4).\nDefinition A.1. Let \u03b3 > 0, 0 \u2264 \u03bd < 1 and b = (b(x))x\u2208Zd be a collection\nof random variables on a common probability space. Then b is polynomially\n\u03bd-mixing (of order \u03b3) if, for any fixed \u03bc > 0,\n(A.1)\n\nsup\n\nsup\n\ns\u2208Zd\n\nf \u2208MbBs ,g\u2208MbBs +s\n\n|s|\u03b3 | cov(f, g)| < \u221e,\n\nwhere Bs = B(0, \u03bc|s|\u03bd ).\nNote that polynomial mixing is the same as polynomial 0-mixing.\nLet a1 = (a1 (x))x\u2208Zd and a2 = (a2 (x))x\u2208Zd be two independent families\nof directed ancestral functions that have the same law as the function a\nconstructed in Section 2, where for a2 the direction has been reversed, that\nis, each ej , j = 1, . . . , d, has been replaced by \u2212ej . The quantities hi and Hi ,\n\n\f30\n\nM. BRAMSON, O. ZEITOUNI AND M. P. W. ZERNER\n\ni = 1, 2, are defined analogously to h and H in (1) and (25) by using ai ; the\nquantities \u03b1 and \u03c9 are given as before by (30) and (62).\nWe will investigate the mixing properties of the above variables. Our\nstrategy will be to first use i.i.d. random variables (Li (x))x\u2208Zd ,i\u2208{1,2} to\nconstruct a realization of the ancestral functions ai ; this will allow us to\nconclude that the pair (a1 , a2 ) is polynomially \u03bd-mixing (Lemma A.1). We\nextend polynomial \u03bd-mixing to the collection (a1 , h1 , a2 , h2 ) (Lemma A.2),\nthen to the collections (a1 , h1 , H1 , a2 , h2 , H2 ) (Lemma A.3) and (\u03b1, H1 , H2 )\n(Lemma A.4), and finally to the variables (\u03c9(x))x\u2208Zd (Lemma A.5). In each\nstep, we will use the definitions and appropriate tail estimates to \"localize\"\nthe random variables that are involved. The details depend on the specific\nrandom variables at each step.\nThe proofs of all five lemmas employ the following elementary inequality:\nfor any measurable functions f, g, f \u0304 and \u1e21 that are bounded in absolute value\nby 1,\n| cov(f, g)| \u2264 | cov(f \u0304, \u1e21)| + | cov(f \u2212 f \u0304, g)| + | cov(f \u0304, g \u2212 \u1e21)|\n(A.2)\n\u2264 | cov(f \u0304, \u1e21)| + 4(P[f 6= f \u0304] + P[g 6= \u1e21]).\n\nThe first inequality in (A.2) is an immediate consequence of the bilinearity of\nthe covariance function. Throughout this section, in addition to depending\non \u03b2 and d, all constants ci are also allowed to depend on \u03bc and \u03bd.\nLemma A.1. For d \u2265 2 and 0 \u2264 \u03bd < 1/d, the collection ((a1 , a2 )(x))x\u2208Zd\nis polynomially \u03bd-mixing of order 1 \u2212 d\u03bd.\n\nProof. We may assume that the ancestral functions a1 and a2 have\nbeen defined by two independent families (L1 (x))x and (L2 (x))x of umbrella\nlengths.\nTo prove that (a1 , a2 ) is polynomially \u03bd-mixing, we \"localize\" the variables\nai and show that the localization does not cause damage. Let \u03bbij (x) denote\nthe value of \u03bbj (x) that corresponds to the collection Li as in (12). We set,\nfor i = 1, 2, j = 1, . . . , d and s, x \u2208 Zd ,\n(A.3)\n\n\u03bbs,i\nj (x) =\n\nsup\n\ny\u2208B(x,|s|/8) : x\u2208y+(\u22121)i+1 Uj,Li (y)\n\nLi (y).\n\nThe random variable \u03bbs,i\nj (x) is the length of the largest umbrella whose j side\npasses through x and whose vertex y is contained in B(x, |s|/8). Let I s,i (x),\ni = 1, 2, s, x \u2208 Zd , be the unique element of {1, . . . , d} for which\n\u03bbs,i\n(x) = min{\u03bbs,i\nj (x)|j = 1, . . . , d};\nI s,i (x)\n\nthis is the direction with the smallest \"protecting\" umbrellas. We now set\n\u0101i (x) = x + (\u22121)i+1 eI s,i (x) ; this corresponds to the definition of a(x) in Section 2.\n\n\fTREES AND RANDOM WALKS IN RANDOM ENVIRONMENTS\n(a ,a )\n\n31\n\n(a ,a )\n\nLet (f, g) \u2208 MBs1 2 \u00d7 MBs1+s2 [where the notation is the same as in (4)].\nLet (f \u0304, \u1e21) denote the same functions for the collection (\u01011 , \u01012 ) instead of\n(a1 , a2 ). To show that (A.1) holds, we use (A.2) to compare cov(f, g) with\ncov(f \u0304, \u1e21).\nWe will show that cov(f \u0304, \u1e21) = 0 for s chosen large enough so that\n|s| \u2212 diam(Bs ) \u2265 |s|/2. To see this, set\nB\u0302s =\nB\u0302s+\n\n=\n\n\u0012\n\n[\n\ny\u2208Bs\n\n\u0012\n\n[\n\ny\u2208Bs\n\n\u0013\n\n|s|\n,\n8\n\nB y,\n\n\u0013\n\n|s|\n.\nB y,\n8\n+s\n\nThen, for large s,\nd(B\u0302s , B\u0302s+ ) \u2265 |s| \u2212 diam(Bs ) \u2212 |s|/4 \u2265 |s|/4;\n\nin particular, B\u0302s \u2229 B\u0302s+ = \u2205. Since f \u0304 depends on only those random variables Li (x) with x \u2208 B\u0302s and since \u1e21 depends on only Li (x) with x \u2208 B\u0302s+ , it\nfollows that f \u0304 and \u1e21 are independent and hence that cov(f \u0304, \u1e21) = 0.\nWe next bound P[f 6= f \u0304]. The functions f and f \u0304 can differ only if there\ni\nis an i \u2208 {1, 2}, a j \u2208 {1, . . . , d} and an x \u2208 Bs such that \u03bbs,i\nj (x) 6= \u03bbj (x). In\ni\nparticular, for such i, j and x, \u03bbj (x) \u2265 |s|/8d, since diam(ULi (x) ) \u2264 dLi (x).\nConsequently, by Lemma 4, for appropriate c32 ,\nP[f 6= f \u0304] \u2264\n\n2 X\nd X\nX\n\ni=1 j=1 x\u2208Bs\n\nP\n\n\u0014\n\n\u03bbij (x) \u2265\n\n\u0015\n\n16d2 c3 (#Bs )\n|s|\n\u2264 c32 |s|d\u03bd\u22121 .\n\u2264\n8d\n|s|\n\nThe same bound holds for P[g 6= \u1e21]. Together with (A.2) and cov(f \u0304, \u1e21) = 0,\nthis implies (A.1) with \u03b3 = 1 \u2212 d\u03bd and hence the lemma. \u0003\nWe extend polynomial \u03bd-mixing from the pair (a1 , a2 ) to the collection\n(a1 , h1 , a2 , h2 ).\nLemma A.2. For d \u2265 2 and 0 \u2264 \u03bd < 1/d, the collection ((a1 , h1 , a2 ,\nh2 )(x))x\u2208Zd is polynomially \u03bd-mixing of order (1 \u2212 d\u03bd)(d \u2212 1)/(2d \u2212 1).\nProof. Fix \u03b4 = (1 + \u03bd(d \u2212 1))/(2d \u2212 1) and note that \u03b4 > \u03bd because\n\u03bd < 1/d.

By stationarity, P[As (Bs )] = P[As (Bs + s)],\n(a,h)\nwhere Bs is as in Definition A.1. Hence, by (A.2), for any (f, g) \u2208 MBs \u00d7\n\n\f32\n\nM. BRAMSON, O. ZEITOUNI AND M. P. W.

For G \u2282 Zd , set\nGs (G) = \u03c3((a1 (y), a2 (y)), y \u2208 Ds (G)),\nwhere\nDs (G) = {y \u2208 Zd |d(y, G) \u2264 |s|\u03b4 + 1}.\nTo determine if hi (x) < |s|\u03b4 for x \u2208 G, it suffices to check whether all branches\nof Treei (x) terminate within Ds (G). These events are measurable with respect to the ancestral functions ai restricted to Ds (G) and, hence, are measurable with respect to Gs (G), so As (G) \u2208 Gs (G). Similarly, the random\nvariables hi (x), x \u2208 G, are determined by ai restricted to Ds (G). Therefore,\nsetting G = Bs and G = Bs + s, respectively, it follows that f 1As (Bs ) and\ng1As (Bs +s) are Gs (Bs )- and Gs (Bs + s)-measurable, respectively. It is easy to\nsee that diam(Ds (Bs )) = diam(Ds (Bs + s)) \u2264 c33 |s|\u03b4 since \u03b4 > \u03bd, where c33 is\nallowed to depend on \u03bc but not on s, f or g. Consequently, by Lemma A.1,\nfor appropriate c34 ,\n(A.6) |cov(f 1As (Bs ) , g1As (Bs +s) )| \u2264 c34 |s|\u2212(1\u2212d\u03b4) = c34 |s|\u2212(d\u22121)(\u03b4\u2212\u03bd) ,\nwhere the last equality follows from the choice of \u03b4.\nTo bound P[As (Bs )c ], we note that on As (Bs )c , there exist x \u2208 Bs and\ni \u2208 {1, 2} with hi (x) \u2265 |s|\u03b4 . For each x\u2032 \u2208 Ray(x), hi (x\u2032 ) \u2265 hi (x) \u2265 |s|\u03b4 . Moreover, Ray(x) must intersect the boundary \u2202Bs of Bs at some point y; thus,\non As (Bs )c , hi (y) \u2265 |s|\u03b4 . Consequently, for appropriate c35 ,\n(A.7)\n\nP[As (Bs )c ] \u2264 2(#\u2202Bs )P[h1 (0) \u2265 |s|\u03b4 ] \u2264 c35 |s|\u2212(d\u22121)(\u03b4\u2212\u03bd) ,\n\nwhere (3) of Theorem 2 was used in the second inequality. Substitution of\n(A.6) and (A.7) into (A.5) implies the lemma. \u0003\nWe next strengthen the above lemma by including Hi . Recall that the\ndefinition of Hi in (25) depends on the parameter \u03b2 \u2208 Id = (0, (d \u2212 2)/2d).\nLemma A.3. For d \u2265 3, fixed 0 < \u03bd < 1/d and all \u03b2 > 0 small enough,\nthe collection ((a1 , h1 , H1 , a2 , h2 , H2 )(x))x\u2208Zd is polynomially \u03bd-mixing of order \u03b3 = (1 \u2212 d\u03bd)(d \u2212 1)/(2d \u2212 1).\n\n\fTREES AND RANDOM WALKS IN RANDOM ENVIRONMENTS\n\n33\n\nProof. Assume that \u03b2 \u2208 Id . We use (a, h, H) as shorthand notation\n(a,h,H)\n(a,h,H)\n\u00d7 MBs +s for s \u2208 Zd . For\nfor (a1 , h1 , H1 , a2 , h2 , H2 ). Let (f, g) \u2208 MBs\ni = 1, 2 and x \u2208 Zd , we set\n(A.8)\n\nH\u0304i (x) = sup{hi (y)|x \u2208 B(y, hi (y)\u03b2 ), d(y, Bs ) \u2264 |s|\u03bd },\n\nH\u0304i+ (x) = sup{hi (y)|x \u2208 B(y, hi (y)\u03b2 ), d(y, Bs + s) \u2264 |s|\u03bd }.\n\nThe quantities H\u0304i and H\u0304i+ are \"localized\" versions of Hi , which was defined\nin (25).\nLet f \u0304 be defined the same way as f , except that one uses the random\nvariables (a1 , h1 , H\u03041 , a2 , h2 , H\u03042 ) instead of (a, h, H). Similarly, let \u1e21 be defined the same way as g, except that one uses (a1 , h1 , H\u03041+ , a2 , h2 , H\u03042+ ) instead of (a, h, H). Note that f \u0304 (resp. \u1e21) is measurable with respect to\nthe random variables (a1 , h1 , a2 , h2 )(y) with |y| \u2264 (\u03bc + 1)|s|\u03bd (resp. with\n|y \u2212 s| \u2264 (\u03bc + 1)|s|\u03bd ).

By the definition of f and f \u0304,\nf 6= f \u0304 can only occur if there exist i, y and x with i \u2208 {1, 2}, d(y, Bs ) > |s|\u03bd\nand x \u2208 B(y, hi (y)\u03b2 ) \u2229 Bs . For such y and x, hi (y)\u03b2 \u2265 |y \u2212 x| > |s|\u03bd and,\ntherefore, Hi (x) \u2265 hi (y) > |s|\u03bd/\u03b2 . Consequently,\n(A.10)\n\nP[f 6= f \u0304] \u2264 P[Hi (x) \u2265 |s|\u03bd/\u03b2 for some x \u2208 Bs and i \u2208 {1, 2}]\n\n(26)\n\u2264 2(#Bs )P[H1 (0) \u2265 |s|\u03bd/\u03b2 ] \u2264 c36 |s|d\u03bd\u2212((1\u2212\u03b2)d\u22121)\u03bd/\u03b2\n\nfor appropriate c36 . [We remind the reader that c36 is allowed to depend on\n(a,h,H)\n\u00d7\n\u03b2, \u03bc and \u03bd, but not on the specific choice of functions (f, g) \u2208 MBs\n(a,h,H)\n\nMBs +s .] For \u03b2 chosen small enough, the right-hand side of (A.10) decays\nto 0 with exponent larger than \u03b3. An upper bound for P[g 6= \u1e21] is obtained\nsimilarly. Together with (A.9) and (A.2), this completes the proof of the\nlemma. \u0003\nThe next lemma shows that the triple (\u03b1, H1 , H2 ) is polynomially \u03bdmixing. Since the ancestral function \u03b1 was defined only on T1 \u222a T2 [in (30)],\nwe find it convenient to extend the definition, setting \u03b1(x) = \u2206 for some\n\u2206\u2208\n/ Zd and all x \u2208\n/ T1 \u222a T2 .\nLemma A.4.

Let \u03b2 \u2208 Id and fix (f, g) \u2208 MBs 1 2 \u00d7MBs +s1 2\nfor s \u2208 Zd . By the definition of \u03b1, f is a measurable function of the random\nvariables (ai (x), Hi (x), 1x\u2208Ti )i=1,2;x\u2208Bs and g is a measurable function of\n(ai (x), Hi (x), 1x\u2208Ti )i=1,2;x\u2208Bs +s .\nWe proceed to \"localize\" the variables 1x\u2208Ti ; this will allow us to apply\n(A.2) the same way as in the previous lemmas.

Note that {x \u2208 Ti } \u2286 Si (x),\nbecause one recovers the event {x \u2208 Ti } by altering the definition of Si (x) by\nremoving the restriction n \u2264 |s|6\u03bd and not truncating the radius of the ball\naround ani (x) at |s|6\u03bd . The event Si (x) is local in the sense that Si (x) is an\nelement of the \u03c3-field generated by (ai (y), hi (y), Hj (y)) with |y \u2212 x| \u2264 2|s|6\u03bd .\n(The event {x \u2208 Ti }, of course, does not have this property.) Consequently,\nf \u0304 is measurable with respect to the \u03c3-field generated by (ai (y), hi (y), Hi (y)),\nwhere d(y, Bs ) \u2264 2|s|6\u03bd and i \u2208 {1, 2}. Similarly, \u1e21 is measurable with respect\nto the \u03c3-field generated by (ai (y), hi (y), Hi (y)), where d(y, Bs + s) \u2264 2|s|6\u03bd\nand i \u2208 {1, 2}.\nWe use the localized functions f \u0304 and \u1e21 together with (A.2) to prove\npolynomial \u03bd-mixing.

The exponent of |s| in the first term is \u22125/8 +\n3(1 + \u03b2d)/(2d), which is less than \u22121/10 for d \u2265 3 and \u03b2 > 0 small enough.\nTogether with (A.11) and (A.2), this proves the lemma. \u0003\nWe are finally ready to prove that the environment \u03c9 is polynomially\nmixing. This result is used in the proof of Theorem 3.\nLemma A.5. For d \u2265 3, with \u03b2 > 0 and \u03bd > 0 both small enough, (\u03c9(x))x\u2208Zd\nis polynomially \u03bd-mixing of order 1/13.\nProof. Fix (f, g) \u2208 M\u03c9Bs \u00d7 M\u03c9Bs +s . For G \u2286 Z d , denote by As (G) the\nevent that Hi (x) < |s|1/8d for all x \u2208 G and i = 1, 2. Set f \u0304 = f 1As (Bs ) and\n\u1e21 = g1As (Bs +s) . By Lemma 6,\nP[As (Bs )c ] \u2264 2(#Bs )c17 |s|(1\u2212(1\u2212\u03b2)d)/8d \u2264 c39 |s|\u2212(d\u22121)/8d+d\u03bd+\u03b2/8\nd\u22653\n\n\u2264 c39 |s|\u22121/12+d\u03bd+\u03b2/8 \u2264 c39 |s|\u22121/13\n\nfor \u03b2 > 0 and \u03bd > 0 small enough, and appropriate c39 . So, to show polynomial \u03bd-mixing of order 1/13, it suffices to bound the first term on the\nright-hand side of (A.2). For this, we will show that f \u0304 and \u1e21 are measurable\nwith respect to Hs (Bs ) and Hs (Bs + s), respectively, where\nHs (G) = \u03c3((\u03b1(x), H1 (x), H2 (x)), d(x, G) \u2264 c40 |s|1/8d )\nand c40 = 4dc31 , where c31 is as in (59). Since the arguments are the same,\nwe will only do this for f \u0304. It will then follow from Lemma A.4 that the\nfirst term in (A.2) is bounded above by c41 |s|\u22121/10 for appropriate c41 not\ndependent on f, g or s.\nWe note that As (G) \u2208 Hs (G) for G \u2282 Zd and so As (Bs ) \u2208 Hs (Bs ). For\nG \u2282 Zd , write NG for the set of functions that are measurable with respect\nto Hs (G). Since it is assumed that f \u2208 M\u03c9Bs , to show f \u0304 \u2208 NBs , it is clearly\nenough to show that for x \u2208 Bs ,\n(A.13)\n\n\u03c9(x)1As (Bs ) \u2208 NBs .\n\nThat is, on the event As (Bs ), \u03c9(x) is a (measurable) function of the random\nvariables that generate Hs (Bs ).\n\n\f36\n\nM. BRAMSON, O. ZEITOUNI AND M. P. W. ZERNER\n\nWe first recall how \u03c9(x) was constructed. Whether x \u2208 C1 , x \u2208 C2 or\nneither holds is determined by Z(x). [Recall that z \u2208 Z(x) exactly when\nx \u2208 InsRay(z). For Z(x) 6= \u2205, the direction of InsRay(z) for any z \u2208 Z(x)\ndetermines whether x \u2208 C1 or x \u2208 C2 .] If Z(x) = \u2205, then the components\nof \u03c9(x) all equal 1/2d. If Z(x) 6= \u2205, with x \u2208 Ci , one computes the random\nvariables nz (y), rz (y) and sz (y) for all z \u2208 Z(x) and y \u2208 B(x, c31 Hi (x)) \u2229\nInsRay(z), with c31 as in (59). From these random variables, one determines\nthe quantities \u03c9 z (y) as in (47). One then computes Ez (x), which one uses to\ndetermine z(x); one then sets \u03c9(x) = \u03c9 z(x) (x).\nTo show (A.13), we therefore proceed as follows.\n(a) We show that on As (Bs ), for x \u2208 Bs , the random set Z(x) is a (measurable) function of the random variables that generate Hs (Bs ), that is, for\nz \u2208 Zd , 1z\u2208Z(x) 1As (Bs ) \u2208 NBs .\n(b) We next show that on As (Bs ), x \u2208 Bs \u2229 Ci , z \u2208 Z(x) and y \u2208 B(x,\nc31 Hi (x)) \u2229 InsRay(z), the random variables nz (y), rz (y) and sz (y) are functions of the random variables that generate Hs (Bs ).\n(c) Finally, we show that on As (Bs ), x \u2208 Bs \u2229 Ci and z \u2208 Z(x), Ez (x) is\na function of the random variables that generate Hs (Bs ).\nThe following inclusion, whose justification we defer to the end of the\nproof, is used for all three steps. For all x \u2208 Bs , z \u2208 Z(x) and y \u2208 B(x,\nc31 |s|1/8d ) \u2229 InsRay(z),\n(A.14)\n\n{\u03b1n (z)|0 \u2264 n \u2264 nz (y)} \u2286 B(x, c40 |s|1/8d /2)\n\non As (Bs ).\n\nIn particular, (a) is an immediate consequence of (A.14) with y = x and the\ndefinition of InsRay(z).\nTo see (b), first note that by (A.14), on As (Bs ), the variables nz (y),\n\u03b1nz (y) (z) and \u03b1nz (y)+1 (z) are functions of the random variables that generate\nHs (Bs ). [The set B(x, c40 |s|1/8d /2) was enlarged to B(x, c40 |s|1/8d ) to include\n\u03b1nz (y)+1 in Hs (Bs ).] Since rz (y) and sz (y) are determined by \u03b1nz (y) (z) and\n\u03b1nz (y)+1 (z), (b) follows.\nTo see (c), recall that for x \u2208 Ci , Ez (x) = E\u03c9xz [Tz ; Tz \u2264 c31 Hi (x)]. The\nRWRE is nearest neighbor and so, starting at x, will not escape B(x, c31 |s|1/8d )\nby time c31 |s|1/8d . On As (Bs ), Hi (x) \u2264 |s|1/8d . Consequently, on As (Bs ),\nEz (x) is a function of \u03c9 z on B(x, c31 |s|1/8d ) and of InsRay(z). By (A.14),\n(47) and (b), the claim in (c) holds.\nIt only remains to show (A.14). First observe that on As (Bs ), for any\nz \u2208 Z(x),\n(A.15)\n\n|z \u2212 x| \u2264 |z \u2212 \u03b1nz (x) (z)| + |\u03b1nz (x) (z) \u2212 x| \u2264 nz (x) + nz (x)\u03b2\n\u2264 2nz (x) \u2264 2(H1 (x) \u2228 H2 (x)) \u2264 2|s|1/8d .\n\n\fTREES AND RANDOM WALKS IN RANDOM ENVIRONMENTS\n\n37\n\nThe second inequality follows from the definitions of nz (x) and InsRay(z)\nin (35) and (32); the fourth inequality follows from the definition of H in\n(25) and the inclusion x \u2208 B(\u03b1nz (x) (z), nz (x)\u03b2 ).\nSince B\u221e (x, 2c31 |s|1/8d ) \u2286 B(x, c40 |s|1/8d /2) and since the path \u03b1n (z),\nn = 0, . . . , nz (y), is directed, it suffices to show that both endpoints z and\n\u03b1nz (y) (z) are contained in B\u221e (x, 2c31 |s|1/8d ). This holds for z because of\n(A.15). For \u03b1nz (y) (z), first note that\nnz (y)\u03b2 \u2265 |\u03b1nz (y) (z) \u2212 y|\n\n\u2265 |\u03b1nz (y) (z) \u2212 z| \u2212 |z \u2212 x| \u2212 |x \u2212 y|\n\u2265 nz (y) \u2212 (2 + c31 )|s|1/8d .\n\nThe first inequality follows from the definition of InsRay(z); the last inequality follows from (A.15), since y \u2208 B(x, c31 |s|1/8d ). Since \u03b2 < 1, this implies\nnz (y)\u03b2 \u2264 |s|1/8d for |s| large. Therefore,\n|\u03b1nz (y) (z) \u2212 x|\u221e \u2264 |\u03b1nz (y) (z) \u2212 x| \u2264 |\u03b1nz (y) (z) \u2212 y| + |y \u2212 x| \u2264 2c31 |s|1/8d\nfor |s| large, where we used y \u2208 InsRay(z) in the last inequality. This demonstrates (A.14) and completes the proof of the lemma. \u0003\nRemark. The only place where the explicit structure of the function\na is used is in the proof of Lemma A.1. Given any ancestral functions \u0101i ,\ni = 1, 2, that are directed in opposite directions and for which the conclusion\nof Lemma A.1 holds, Lemmas A.2\u2013A.5 will continue to hold. In particular,\nthe environment \u03c9\u0304 that is constructed from such \u01011 , \u01012 by using the pruning\nand insulation recipe leading up to (62) will be polynomially \u03bd-mixing of\norder 1/13.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Azuma, K.
