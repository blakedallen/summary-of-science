Fuse spectra of the four brightest H ii regions in M 33 show absorption by interstellar gas in the Galaxy\nand in M 33. On three lines of sight molecular hydrogen in M 33 is detected. This is the first measurement of\ndiffuse H2 in absorption in a Local Group galaxy other than the Magellanic Clouds. A quantitative analysis is\ndifficult because of the low signal to noise ratio and the systematic effects produced by having multiple objects\nin the Fuse aperture. We use the M 33 Fuse data to demonstrate in a more general manner the complexity of\ninterpreting interstellar absorption line spectra towards multi-object background sources. We derive H2 column\ndensities of \u2248 1016 to 1017 cm\u22122 along 3 sight lines (NGC 588, NGC 592, NGC 595). Because of the systematic\neffects, these values most likely represent upper limits and the non-detection of H2 towards NGC 604 does not\nexclude the existence of significant amounts of molecular gas along this sight line.\nKey words. Galaxies: individual: M 33 \u2013 ISM: abundances \u2013 ISM: molecules \u2013 Ultraviolet: ISM\n\n1. Introduction\nObservations with the Copernicus satellite have shown\nthat the ISM of the Milky Way contains large amounts of\nmolecular hydrogen. The mass in H2 may even dominate\nthat in atomic form (see Savage et al. 1977). Since 1996\nother galaxies also have become accessible for investigation of the content of H2 , using Orfeus and Fuse far ultraviolet spectra. Both the Large and the Small Magellanic\nCloud appear to have substantial amounts of H2 as found\nfrom absorption line studies (de Boer et al. 1998; Richter\net al. 1998; Richter 2000, Tumlinson et al. 2002).\nFuse has sufficient sensitivity to record spectra of\nbright sources in other nearby galaxies such as M 31 and\nM 33. It is of importance to extend our knowledge about\nthe content in molecular gas to galaxies other than the\nMilky Way and the LMC and SMC. These galaxies have\ndifferent histories, different stellar contents and different\nabundances. An intercomparison of these galaxies may\nlead to clues about the interplay of molecular cloud and\nstar formation with chemical content and radiation field.\nM 33 is the smallest spiral galaxy of the Local Group at\na distance of \u223c 800 kpc. It has a ragged optical appearance\nand bright H ii regions, some of them catalogued as NGC\n\nobjects. The galaxy is inclined at 55\u25e6 and shows signs of\nbending as derived from 21 cm radio synthesis observations (Rogstad et al. 1976). In the direction of two of the\nbright H ii regions CO has been found in emission (Wilson\n& Scoville 1992). The metallicity of M 33 is subsolar with\na radial abundance gradient which differs for different elements. For example, neon abundances in the observed H ii\nregions vary between 0.2 and 0.3 dex subsolar (see Willner\n& Nelson-Patel 2002). Vibrationally excited H2 has been\nfound in emission by Israel et al. (1990) towards NGC 604,\nmost likely from background gas.\nIn this paper we investigate Fuse spectra of four bright\nobjects in M 33. Each of these consist of a number of young\nand thus UV-bright stars surrounded by an H ii region. In\n3 of the 4 spectra H2 is detected in absorption in M 33.\nIn Sect. 2 we give some information about the instrument, the targets, and the data reduction, in Sect. 3 the\ndifficulties with the interpretation of interstellar absorption spectra towards multi-object background sources are\ndescribed. The measurements are presented in Sect. 4, followed by a discussion of the results in Sect. 5.\n\n2. Data\n2.1. The instrument\n\nSend offprint requests to: e-mail: hbluhm@astro.uni-bonn.de\n\u22c6\nBased on observations made with the NASA-CNES-CSA\nFar Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer, available in the public\narchive. FUSE is operated for NASA by the Johns Hopkins\nUniversity under NASA contract NAS5-32985.\n\nFuse is equipped with four coaligned telescopes and\nRowland spectrographs. The detectors are two microchannel plates. For a description of the instrument and its onorbit performance see Moos et al. (2000) and Sahnow et al.\n\n\f2\n\nH.

For NGC 588,\nNGC 595, and NGC 604 HST WFPC 2 images (central wavelength 1730 \u00c5) are shown, for NGC 592 only a DSS1\nimage was available.\n(2000). Information about Fuse data and their analysis\ncan be found in the Fuse Data Handbook1 .\nThe typical velocity resolution of Fuse spectra is\nabout 20 km s\u22121 . Because of variations in the alignment of\nthe 8 different detector channels the measurement of absolute radial velocities is problematic and requires a separate\ndiscussion (see Sect. 4.2).\nThe sensitivity threshold of Fuse is set by the uncertainty in the background intensity level. It is below\n(2 \u2212 4) \u00d7 10\u221215 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 \u00c5\u22121 .

Curves of growth for absorption by H2 in M 33. The solid curves are for the best fit (or best guess) b-value,\nthe position of the data points on the log(f \u03bb) axis corresponds to the \"optimum\" column densities given in Table 3.\nThe dashed and dotted curves represent the upper and lower limits of b-values consistent with the data. They were\nused to determine the minimum and maximum column densities given in Table 3.\nwith their orientation and the exposure times are given in\nTable 1.\nInspection of imagery of the M 33 H ii regions shows\nthat the Fuse aperture has included numerous objects, of\nwhich only few were bright enough in the UV to have contributed to the background flux. Nevertheless, the signal\nrecorded is the sum of the flux of several stars. This implies\nthat the spectra provide a blend of spectra from different\nlines of sight with different line of sight gas (composition\nand velocity) structure, in particular within M 33.\nIn an attempt to account for this complexity, the imagery (Fig. 1) has been investigated to identify the bright-\n\nest sources in the field. We have included the scanty information from that in Table 1.\nThe complexity of the background sources complicates\nthe interpretation of the interstellar absorption features as\ndescribed in Sect. 3. Furthermore, the shape of the continua is difficult to assess in some cases.\nWhile the FUV fluxes of all 4 H ii regions\nare well above the sensitivity of Fuse (\u2248 5 \u00d7\n10\u221214 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 \u00c5\u22121 for NGC 588, NGC 592, and\nNGC 595), the exposure times were too short to have\nmore than 20 to 50 counts per 20 km s\u22121 resolution element.

Sample interstellar spectra are shown in Fig. 2, a few other spectra are given by\nWakker et al. (2002). Note that the spectra in Fig. 2 are rebinned over 10 pixels.

General considerations for the interpretation\n3.1. Velocity structure\n\n2.3. Data reduction\nThe raw spectra were calibrated with the Calfuse 1.8.7 reduction pipeline. For analysis the spectra were smoothed\nwith a 5 pixel (NGC 604) or a 10 pixel boxcar filter (NGC 588, 592, 595) in order to handle the strong\nnoise. Equivalent widths were measured using trapezium\nor Gaussian fits. The errors were calculated taking into\naccount the photon statistics and the uncertainty in the\nchoice of the continuum.\n\nDue to the presence of several background targets within\nthe Fuse aperture the resulting spectrum is the sum of\nsingle spectra with different fluxes and absorption features. At the distance of M 33 one arcsecond corresponds\nto a projected distance of about 4 pc, so the Fuse aperture covers an area of roughly 120 \u00d7 120 pc2 . As Fig. 1\nshows, the stars which dominate the UV fluxes lie within\nsmaller areas of about 50 \u00d7 50 to 70 \u00d7 70 pc2 .

As can be seen in Fig. 2, the H2 and metal line\nabsorption is wider than normally seen, but substantially\nless than the indicated maximum spread.

The Fuse spectra contain blends of the spectra\nof the brightest objects contained in the aperture. The\neffects of such blends are explored assuming two equally\nbright background stars but one having a 2.6 dex higher\nH2 column density. Panel A) shows the curve of growth\nfor the single sight-line spectrum with low H2 column density, panel B) the one for high H2 column density. Panel\nC) shows the optical depth relation for the added spectrum. In each panel the column densities of the rotational\nlevels are indicated in brackets, in C) the mean values\nof the single sight line column densities are given. It is\nobvious that in panel C) a single cloud curve of growth\ninterpretation is inappropriate.\nexpected, especially for molecular gas that exists in confined regions.\nThe velocity structure seen in such a sum spectrum\nthus reflects the combination of the possible presence of\ngas clouds with different velocities in front of the cluster, and/or possibly differing absorption velocities on the\nindividual sight lines.\nFor the Galactic foreground absorption the latter effect\nof widely separated background sources in M 33 is probably of minor importance. While column density variations\nin the ISM are known to exist on small scales, velocity\n\nIn order to judge in which way the blending of the light\nfrom the individual objects affects the interpretation of\nthe spectra we will consider a simple but realistic case.\nFor a single line of sight, several clouds and velocity\ncomponents contribute to the interstellar absorption spectrum and the optical depth in an absorption profile is the\nsum of optical depths along the sight line.\nIn contrast, for a sum of spectra of different sight lines\nthe measured equivalent widths of interstellar lines are\nmean values of the equivalent widths belonging to individual sight lines weighted by the flux of the background\nsources.\nWe have constructed a simple case of blending to investigate in which way the data become less accessible\nfor interpretation. We consider two sight lines which contribute to one total spectrum by equal amounts. The absorption structure of the H2 lines on these lines of sight\nhas been chosen to be different, one has a H2 column density of 4.4 \u00d7 1015 cm\u22122 , the other has 1.8 \u00d7 1018 cm\u22122 .\nConsequently, the lines in one spectrum are much weaker\n(if not even 'absent'), and the light of that star blends\nsome of the absorption present in the other spectrum.\nClearly, the equivalent widths derived from the sum spectrum have been altered compared to those of the single\nspectra.\nColumn densities determined from lines in the linear\npart of the curve of growth are the weighted mean of the\ncolumn densities on the individual sight-lines. If lines in\nthe damping part of the curve of growth are added, the\nmeasured column density is proportional to\nX\n1\nP\n(gi *Wi ))2 .\n(1)\n*\ng\ni\ni\ni\nThis is less or equal to\nX\n1\nP\ngi *Wi2 ,\n*\ni gi\ni\n\n(2)\n\nthe weighted mean of the individual column densities,\nwhere Wi are the equivalent widths in the individual spectra and gi are the weights.

The situation is even more complicated if line profiles from different parts of the curve of\ngrowth are mixed.\nWe illustrate the effects of the considered case in Fig. 5.\nFrom this simple example, considering the resulting optical depth relation (see Fig. 5 c), we conclude that column\ndensities can be derived from the Fuse M 33 H ii region\nspectra only in an approximate manner. In particular, a\nsingle b-value cannot be used to interpret the absorption\nline strengths (as visible in Fig. 5 c).\n\n3.3. Extinction\nIf the dust abundance in front of a cluster is spatially inhomogenous, a selection effect has to be considered for the\ninterpretation of measured column densities. In general\nthe dust abundance is correlated with the column density\nof the gaseous ISM. Sight lines with higher gas column\ndensities have a higher colour-excess, reducing the far UV\nflux in the spectra and thus lowering the weight in the\nsum of spectra. Therefore, column densities measured in\nthe composite spectrum of a cluster can be expected to\nbe lower than the actual (un-weighted) average column\ndensities towards the cluster. Because the abundance of\nH2 is correlated with dust (see Savage et al. 1977, Richter\n2000, Tumlinson et al. 2002), sight lines with high H2 column densities are also expected to be suppressed in the\ncomposite spectrum.\n\n4. Results\n4.1. Column densities\n4.1.1. Molecular hydrogen\nDespite the systematic errors described in Sect. 3 we use\nsingle cloud curves of growth for column density estimates\nbecause the present data do not allow a more detailed\nmodelling. For each rotational level the measured equivalent widths form a set of data points with unknown position on the log(N f \u03bb) axis. These sets are shifted along\nthis axis in order to fit a single-cloud curve of growth.\nIn the present case the range in log(f \u03bb) covered by\neach set of data points is small and the uncertainties in\nthe equivalent widths are large. Thus the ranges of possible\nb-values and column densities are substantial.\n\nB\n\u2212140\n\n14.60+0.60\n15.00+0.10\n\u22120.30\n\u22120.10\n+0.15\n13.65\u22120.10 < 12.9\n16.20+0.30\n\u22120.20\n< 15.0\n\nAs mentioned in Sect. 3.2, in the case of a multiple background source, column densities derived from the\ndamping part are systematically lower than the weighted\nmean of column densities for the individual sight lines.\nThus the upper limits are not as rigid as they would be\nfor a single sight line.\n\n4.1.2. Metals\nThe curve of growth method was also used to obtain Fe ii\nand Ar i column densities. The results, especially for Fe ii,\ncan be assumed to be more reliable than those for H2 .\nDue to the usually higher b - values in the warm neutral\nmedium and the large range of log f \u03bb - values of accessible Fe ii lines some data points lie on the linear part of\nthe curve of growth (see Fig. 4). Fe ii and Ar i are the\npredominant ionization states of Fe and Ar in the neutral interstellar medium. The cosmic abundance ratio is\nlog(Fe/Ar)\u2243 1.1. According to Sofia & Jenkins (1998) argon is unlikely to be bound to dust in clouds that are thin\nenough to be observed in absorption. In partially ionized\nclouds, significant amounts of argon can be ionized due\nto its large ionization cross section although its ionization\nenergy lies above that of hydrogen. Sofia & Jenkins (1998)\nmeasured Ar i depletions between 0.2 and 0.6 on Galactic\nsight lines. Therefore, in general, the Fe/Ar ratio will yield\nan estimate for the iron depletion that is too low.\nThe degree of ionization of oxygen is coupled to that\nof hydrogen due to charge exchange reactions. Thus it\nwould be desirable to know O i column densities, which\nthen could be converted into H i column densities provided\nthe metallicity is known. Unfortunately the 1039 \u00c5 line\nof O i is affected by blending with H2 lines and emission\nfeatures and lies in the flat part of the curve of growth.\nWe have included a plot of this line in Fig. 2, but do not\nanalyse it. Only the spectrum of NGC 604 has a sufficient\ncount rate below 1000 \u00c5 for a measurement of the O i line\nat 976 \u00c5.\nMetal column densities are given in Table 2.\n\n4.2. Velocities\nBecause of the possible apparent velocity shifts induced\nby multiple background sources, and the variations in the\nalignment of the optical channels of Fuse we measured\n\n\f8\n\nH. Bluhm et al.: Interstellar H2 in M 33\n\nonly velocity differences between Galactic and M 33 absorption components. Noise and continuum uncertainties\nlimit the precision to about 10 km s\u22121 .\nUsing data from the Leiden - Dwingeloo - Survey\n(Hartmann & Burton 1997), the velocity of the Galactic\nH i in the direction of M 33 can be determined. We fit\nvLSR = 0 km s\u22121 and convert the measured Fuse velocities to LSR velocities.\nWe compared emission line data (CO, H i, H ii or other\nions) from the literature with the Fuse absorption line\ndata to get hints on the location of the absorbing gas relative to the H ii regions and the M 33 disk. Velocities of H i\n21 cm emission are taken from Rogstad et al. (1976) who\nfound two disk components, a \"main\" and a more patchy\n\"weak\" one. These H i \"main component\" velocities are\nin agreement with velocities extracted from the work of\nDeul & van der Hulst (1987) based on observations with a\n5 to 10 times higher angular resolution. Notably, no \"weak\ncomponent\" shows up in the Deul & van der Hulst data\nat the positions of the H ii regions. This may be due the\npatchiness of that component or to lower sensitivity of the\nhigher resolution data.\n\n4.3. Comments on the sight lines\n\nTable 3. M 33 H2 column densities [cm\u22122 ]. For none\nof the sight lines a definite b-value could be determined.\nThus column densities of the rotational levels for maximum,optimum,and minimum b-values [km s\u22121 ] consistent\nwith the data are given in the 3rd, 4th, and 5th column.\nFor NGC 588 the damping limit was used to derive the\nupper limits of the column densities. Though the actual bvalue is certainly > 0 km s\u22121 , a vanishing Doppler parameter cannot be excluded by the data. For NGC 604 upper\nlimits were derived using the Doppler- and the dampingpart of the curve of growth.\n\nNGC 588\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nNGC 592\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n\n4.3.1. NGC 588\nOne M 33 velocity component is detected in absorption\nby metals and H2 in this direction. However further components could be hidden due to the limited resolution and\nthe noise. The radial velocity of \u2212140 km s\u22121 is about the\nsame as that of the weak H i component seen in emission.\nThe velocity of the main H i component (\u2212160 km s\u22121 ) is\nmore similar to that of the emitting gas in the H ii region\n(\u2212168 km s\u22121 , see O'Dell & Townsley 1988). The column\ndensities of Fe ii and Ar i indicate some depletion of iron\nand thus the presence of dust.\n\nNGC 595\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n\n4.3.2. NGC 592\nFor this H ii region no emission line results are available. The smoothed H i velocity maps give about \u2212160\nand \u2212146 km s\u22121 for the \"main\" and the \"weak\" component, respectively. The Fuse absorption velocities of\n\u2212150 and \u2212110 km s\u22121 are closer to the velocity of the\n\"weak component\", but \u2212150 km s\u22121 is also consistent\nwith the main H i component velocity. H2 is found only in\nthe \u2212150 km s\u22121 component.\n\n4.3.3. NGC 595\nAn absorption component at \u2248 \u2212160 km s\u22121 is detected\nin metal and H2 lines. Absorption lines by higher rotational levels (J = 2, 3, 4) are possibly shifted to more negative velocities by 10 or 20 km s\u22121 . Despite the rather\nhigh \"best guess\" value for the H2 column density, the\nFe ii to Ar i ratio points to mild depletion and relatively\nlow dust abundance.

However, clouds detectable in CO emission nor-\n\n\fH. Bluhm et al.: Interstellar H2 in M 33\n\nmally have so much dust that UV star light from behind\nshould not get through. So our data do not refer to such\ndense and opaque gas.\nThe velocity of the main H i emission component is\n\u2248 \u2212183 km s\u22121 , that of the \"weak\" H i component is\n\u2248 \u2212155 km s\u22121 . Possibly the \u2248 \u2212155 km s\u22121 component\ndominates in H2 and metals while in the \u2248 \u2212183 km s\u22121\ncomponent the higher J-levels of H2 contribute more (see,\ne.g., the similar case of HD 5980 in the SMC; Richter et\nal. 1998).\n\n4.3.4. NGC 604\nTwo absorption components are found in metal lines:\na strong one at \u2248 \u2212235 km s\u22121 and a weaker one at\n\u2248 \u2212140 km s\u22121 . The velocity of the first one is consistent with the velocity of the main H i emission component\n(v \u2248 \u2212236 km s\u22121 ), while the velocities of the weaker absorption component and the weak H i emission component\n(v \u2248 \u2212206 km s\u22121 ) do not match.\nNo absorption by H2 at M 33 velocities is present, although Wilson & Scoville (1992) detected CO emission\nsouth-east of the area covered by the Fuse aperture at\na velocity of \u2212242 km s\u22121 . The LSR velocity of the H ii\nregion is \u2212246 km s\u22121 (O'Dell & Townsley 1988), similar\nto that of CO shifted about +10 km s\u22121 compared to the\nmain H i emission component.\nThe comparatively high count rate in this spectrum\nallows the determination of a relatively rigid upper limit\nfor the H2 column density. The non-detection of H2 in\nabsorption is consistent with the measured Fe ii and Ar i\ncolumn densities (see Table 2). In both velocity components the abundances do not indicate any depletion. For\ncomponent A it was possible to measure the O i line at\n976 \u00c5. The O i to Fe ii ratio is consistent with a cosmic\nabundance ratio and no depletion of iron.\n\n5. Discussion\n5.1. H2 or no H2\nThe results for NGC 588, NGC 592, and NGC 595\nare very similar: almost identical Fe ii column densities,\nlog(Fe ii/(Ar i) between 0.3 and 0.7, indicating moderate\niron depletion, and radial velocities consistent with the\n\"weak\" H i component and differing from the main disk\ncomponent.\nThe velocity difference between the H2 detected in absorption and the emission from the H ii regions and the\nmolecular clouds in their vicinity indicates that the observed diffuse H2 is probably not located near the H ii\nregions. Towards NGC 604 the velocity of the main absorption component is consistent with the velocity of the\nmain H i emission component. While the iron column density is about the same as towards the other targets, no H2\nis found on this sight line.\nFor NGC 595 and NGC 604 photometric results have\nbeen published. Wilson & Matthews (1995) give E(B \u2212\n\n9\n\nV ) = 0.35 for NGC 604 and E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.25 for\nNGC 595, based on Palomar 60 inch data. They state\nthat the colour magnitude diagrams suggest the presence\nof \"significantly more differential reddening in NGC 604\nthan in NGC 595\". From HST observations of NGC 595\nMalumuth et al. (1996) find E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.36 \u00b1 0.28. We\nconclude that the average dust abundance towards both\nclusters is comparable, with a considerable scatter which\nis probably larger towards NGC 604. Thus the extinctioneffect discussed in Sect. 3.3 is heavily influencing the apparent H2 column densities in front of the clusters.\nAs the Galactic and Magellanic H2 surveys show\n(Savage et al. 1977, Tumlinson et al. 2002), on sight lines\nwith an E(B \u2212 V ) of 0.2 or larger H2 column densities\nbetween 1019 and 1021 cm\u22122 are common. Though most\nof the E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.36 towards NGC 595 is supposed\nto originate in M 33 (Galactic E(B \u2212 V ) \u2248 0.06, see\nBurstein & Heiles 1982), the estimated H2 column density (\u2248 2 \u00d7 1017 cm\u22122 ) is rather low. There is no sign of\nlines from J = 0 or J = 1 lying in the damping part of\nthe curve of growth as it would be expected for high column densities. A rough estimate of the E(B \u2212 V ) of the\nFUV brightest stars in NGC 595 based on the results published by Malumuth et al. (1996) yields a value of about\n0.1. For a colour excess like this an H2 column density of\n\u2248 1017 cm\u22122 is realistic.\nThe photometric data for NGC 604 are not that detailed as for NGC 595 but it is likely that the extinction\nselection effect is even more significant. If the scatter in\nextinction is indeed larger towards NGC 604, it is probable that there are some almost unreddened stars which\noutshine the rest of the cluster in the far UV. Independent\nof the actual average column density of H2 in front of the\ncluster, the few sight lines with negligible amounts of dust\nor H2 will dominate the UV spectrum and thus lead to a\nnon-detection of H2 .\nOur results make clear that it is difficult to get precise\nquantitative information from absorption spectroscopy of\nextended or multiple background sources using a large\nspectrograph aperture.\n\n5.2. The bottom line\nFor the first time diffuse molecular hydrogen has been\ndetected in absorption in a local group galaxy farther away\nthan the Magellanic Clouds. Since star formation is going\non in M 33 and molecular clouds had been detected in\nemission by CO and excited H2 , the presence of diffuse\nH2 is not unexpected. The estimated column densities are\nsimilar to those found for Milky Way and LMC along lowextinction sight lines.\nMore reliable data of other sight lines are desirable\nto investigate the physical conditions in the diffuse interstellar medium of M 33, especially parameters like radiation field and H2 formation rate. So far, 10 bright OB\nstars in M 33 have been observed with Fuse. Maybe in\nat least some of these lines of sight fewer stars lie in the\n\n\f10\n\nH.

Also, future work with the smaller MDRS or HIRS apertures of\nFuse may alleviate the extinction-selection problem encountered with the current data.\nAcknowledgements.
