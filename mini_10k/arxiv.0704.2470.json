Introduction and results\nLet Mn be the set of all n\u00d7n complex matrices.

This problem has been studied in [13].\nThe study of the spectral Carath\u00e9odory-Fejer problem in the case\nN = 1 reduces to the computation of the Kobayashi\u2013Royden pseudometric of the spectral ball. Recall that for a domain D \u2282 Cm the\nKobayashi\u2013Royden pseudometric is defined as follows:\n\u03baD (z; X) := inf{|\u03b1| : \u2203\u03c6 \u2208O(D, D) :\n\n\u03c6(0) = z, \u03b1\u03c6\u2032 (0) = X}, z \u2208 D, X \u2208 Cm .\n\nIn this note we point out some of the non-stability phenomena of\nboth spectral problems which complicate their study.\nFirst note that if we replace each of the matrices in the spectral\nNevanlinna\u2013Pick problem by similar ones then we do not change its\nsolution.1 A natural reduction of the problems is then to associate to\neach matrix its spectrum, or, in order to deal with n-tuples of complex\nnumbers, the coefficients of its characteristic polynomial\nn\nX\nPA (t) := det(tI \u2212 A) = tn +\n(\u22121)j \u03c3j (A)tn\u2212j ,\nj=1\n\nwhere I \u2208 Mn is the unit matrix,\n\u03c3j (A) := \u03c3j (\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbn ) :=\n\nX\n\n\u03bbk 1 . . . , \u03bbk j\n\n1\u2264k1 <***<kj \u2264n\n\nand \u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbn are the eigenvalues of A.\nPut \u03c3 = (\u03c31 , . . . , \u03c3n ). We shall consider \u03c3 as a map either from\nO(Mn , Cn ), or from O(Cn , Cn ). The set\nGn := {\u03c3(A) : A \u2208 \u03a9n }\n\nis called the symmetrized n-disk, and has been widely studied; we refer\nthe reader to [3, 7, 15, 16, 17] and references there.\nWe recall a few definitions from linear algebra.\nDefinition 1. Given a matrix A \u2208 Mn , the commutant of A is\nC(A) := {M \u2208 Mn : MA = AM},\n\nand the set of polynomials in A, P(A) \u2282 C(A) is given by\n\nP(A) := {M \u2208 Mn : M = p(A), for some p \u2208 C[X]}.\n\n1Indeed,\n\nassume that \u03c6 \u2208 O(D, \u03a9n ), \u03c6(aj ) = Aj and Aj \u223c \u00c3j , 1 \u2264 j \u2264 N .\nThen \u00c3j = e\u00c2j Aj e\u2212\u00c2j for some \u00c2j \u2208 Mn . In the standard way we may find\n\u03c6\u0302 \u2208 O(D, Mn ) with \u03c6\u0302(aj ) = \u00c2j , 1 \u2264 j \u2264 N. Then \u03c6\u0303 := e\u03c6\u0302 * \u03c6 * e\u2212\u03c6\u0302 \u2208 O(D, \u03a9n ) and\n\u03c6\u0303(aj ) = Aj .\n\n\fDISCONTINUITY OF THE LEMPERT FUNCTION OF THE SPECTRAL BALL 3\n\nDefinition 2. Given (a0 , . . . , an\u22121 ) \u2208 Cn , the associated companion\nmatrix is\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n0\n\u2212a0\n..\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec 1 0\n.\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n..\n..\n\uf8f7.\n\uf8ec\n.\n.\n1\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n.\n.\n\uf8ed\n. 0 \u2212an\u22122 \uf8f8\n1 \u2212an\u22121\nThe companion matrix associated to a matrix A is the one associated\nto the coefficients of its characteristic polynomial, namely we set aj =\n(\u22121)n\u2212j \u03c3n\u2212j (A), 0 \u2264 j \u2264 n \u2212 1.\nProposition 3. A matrix A \u2208 Mn with the following equivalent properties is called non-derogatory.\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n(5)\n(6)\n(7)\n(8)\n\nA is similar to its companion matrix.\nThere exists a cyclic vector for A.\nThe characteristic and minimal polynomials of A coincide.\nDifferent blocks in the Jordan normal form of A correspond to\ndifferent eigenvalues (that is, each eigenspace is of dimension\nexactly 1).\nC(A) = P(A).\nrank(\u03c3\u2217,A ) = n.\ndim C(A) = n.\n\u22121\nIf \u03a6A : M\u22121\nn \u2212\u2192 Mn , where Mn stands for the set of invertible matrices, is defined by \u03a6A (P ) := P \u22121 AP , then rank((\u03a6A )\u2217,In )\n= n2 \u2212 n (its maximal possible value).\n\nMost of those properties can be found in [11, pp. 135\u2013147]; more\nprecise references and (easy) complements are given in Section 4.\nRecall that the j-th coordinate of \u03c3\u2217,A (B) is the sum of all j \u00d7 j\ndeterminants obtained by taking a principal j \u00d7 j submatrix of A and\nreplacing one column by the corresponding entries of B. In particular,\nthe first coordinate of \u03c3\u2217,A (B) equals tr(B).\nDenote by Cn the set of all non-derogatory matrices in \u03a9n . Obviously\nCn is an open and dense subset of \u03a9n .\nNote that if A1 , . . . , AN belong to Cn , then any mapping \u03c6 \u2208 O(D, Gn )\nwith \u03c6(\u03b1j ) = \u03c3(Aj ) can be lifted to a mapping \u03c6\u0303 \u2208 O(D, \u03a9n ) with\n\u03c6\u0303(\u03b1j ) = Aj , 1 \u2264 j \u2264 N (see [1]). This means that in a generic case the\nspectral Nevanlinna\u2013Pick problem for \u03a9n with dimension n2 can be reduced to the standard Nevanlinna\u2013Pick problem for Gn with dimension\nn.\n\n\f4\n\nNIKOLAI NIKOLOV, PASCAL J. THOMAS, WLODZIMIERZ ZWONEK\n\nAs a consequence of the existence of the lifting above, we have the\nequality\n(1)\n\nl\u03a9n (A, B) = lGn (\u03c3(A), \u03c3(B)),\n\nA, B \u2208 Cn .\n\nNote that Gn is a taut domain (cf. [9], [15]). In particular, there always\nexist extremal discs for lGn and lGn is a continuous function. Thus the\nspectral Nevanlinna\u2013Pick problem with data (\u03b11 , A1 ), (\u03b11 , A2 ) \u2208 D\u00d7Cn\nis solvable if and only if\nlGn (\u03c3(A), \u03c3(B)) \u2264 m(\u03b11 , \u03b12 ) :=\n\n\u03b11 \u2212 \u03b12\n.\n1 \u2212 \u03b11 \u03b12\n\nAn explicit formula for lG2 is found in [3]. The proof there is based\non studying the complex geodesics of G2 . It turns out that tanh\u22121 lG2\ncoincides with the Carath\u00e9odory distance of G2 . On the other hand,\nG2 cannot be exhausted by domains biholomorphic to convex domains\n(see [5], [8]). So G2 serves as the first counterexample to converse of the\nLempert theorem (cf. [15]). In spite of this phenomenon, tanh\u22121 lGn ,\ndoes not even satisfy the triangle inequality for n > 2, that is, it does\nnot coincide with the Kobayashi distance of Gn for n > 2 (see [17]).\nThe behavior of l\u03a9n is much more complicated when one of the arguments is derogatory. However, if A is a scalar matrix, say A = tI,\nt \u2208 D, then (cf. [1])\n(2)\n\nl\u03a9n (tI, B) = max m(t, \u03bb).\n\u03bb\u2208sp(B)\n\nTo prove (2), observe first that B \u2192 (B \u2212 tI)(I \u2212 tB)\u22121 is an automorphism of \u03a9n . So we may assume that t = 0. Then it remains to\nmake use of the fact that l\u03a9n (0, B) equals the Minkowski function of\nthe balanced domain \u03a9n at B, that is, r(B).\nSince the 2 \u00d7 2 derogatory matrices are scalar, we also get that the\nfunction l\u03a92 is not continuous at the point (A, B) if and only if one\nof the matrices is scalar, say A, and the other one has two distinct\neigenvalues (see [6]). In this case even l\u03a92 (*, B) is not continuous at A\n(but l\u03a92 (A, *) is continuous at B). We shall show that this phenomenon\nextends to \u03a9n .\nProposition 4. For B \u2208 Cn and t \u2208 D the following conditions are\nequivalent:\n(i) the eigenvalues of B are equal;\n(ii) the function l\u03a9n is continuous at the point (tI, B);\n(iii) the function l\u03a9n (*, B) is continuous at the point tI;\n\n\fDISCONTINUITY OF THE LEMPERT FUNCTION OF THE SPECTRAL BALL 5\n\nAt the infinitesimal level of the Kobayashi\u2013Royden pseudometric, for\nA \u2208 Cn and B \u2208 Mn one has that (see Theorem 2.1 in [13])\n\n(3)\n\n\u03ba\u03a9n (A; B) = \u03baGn (\u03c3(A); \u03c3\u2217,A (B)).\n\nSince \u03ba\u03a9n (A; B) \u2265 \u03baGn (\u03c3(A); \u03c3\u2217,A (B)) for (A; B) \u2208 \u03a9n \u00d7 Mn , \u03ba\u03a9n is an\nupper semicontinuous function and \u03baGn is continuous (because Gn is a\ntaut domain), we get that \u03ba\u03a9n is a continuous function at any point\n(A; B) \u2208 Cn \u00d7 Mn .\nThe things are more complicated if A 6\u2208 Cn .\n\nProposition 5. For B \u2208 Mn and t \u2208 D the following conditions are\nequivalent:\n(i) the eigenvalues of B are equal;\n(ii) the function \u03ba\u03a9n is continuous at the point (tI; B);\n(iii) the function \u03ba\u03a9n (*; B) is continuous at the point tI;\nNote that, similarly to the equality (2), one has that\nmax\u03bb\u2208sp(B) |\u03bb|\n(4)\n\u03ba\u03a9n (tI; B) =\n.\n1 \u2212 |t|2\nAs a consequence of our considerations, we may also identify in a\nsimple way the convex hull \u03a9\u0302n of \u03a9n .\nProposition 6. \u03a9\u0302n = {A \u2208 Mn : |tr(A)| < n}.\n\nWe now turn to analyzing the failure of hyperbolicity of \u03a9n . Observe\nfirst that if sp(A) 6= sp(B) then \u03c3(A) 6= \u03c3(B) and hence\nl\u03a9n (A, B) \u2265 lGn (\u03c3(A), \u03c3(B)) > 0.\n\nThen as a consequence of the proof of Lemma 13 in [9] we have the\nfollowing\nProposition 7. For any A, B \u2208 \u03a9n the equality l\u03a9n (A, B) = 0 holds\nif and only if sp(A) = sp(B). Moreover, in this case there is a \u03c6 \u2208\nO(C, \u03a9n ) with \u03c6(0) = A, \u03c6(1) = B and sp(\u03c6(\u03bb)) = sp(A) for any\n\u03bb \u2208 C.\nIt is natural to consider the infinitesimal version of this proposition.\nFirst, note that the equality (4) implies that if A \u2208 \u03a9n is a scalar\nmatrix and B \u2208 Mn , then \u03ba\u03a9n (A; B) = 0 if and only if sp(B) = 0.\nConversely, A is scalar and sp(B) = 0, then the linear mapping p :\n\u03bb \u2192 A + \u03bbB has the following properties: p(0) = A, p\u2032 (0) = B and\nsp(p(\u03bb)) = sp(A) for any \u03bb \u2208 C.\nOn the other hand, the equality (3) implies that if A \u2208 Cn and\nB \u2208 Mn , then \u03ba\u03a9n (A; B) = 0 if and only if \u03c3\u2217,A (B) = 0.

If A \u2208 Cn , B \u2208 Mn and \u03ba\u03a9n (A; B) = 0, then there is\na mapping \u03c6 \u2208 O(C, \u03a9n ) with \u03c6(0) = A, \u03c6\u2032 (0) = B and sp(\u03c6(\u03bb)) =\nsp(A) for any \u03bb \u2208 C.\nThese observations let us state the following\nConjecture 9. If A \u2208 \u03a9n , B \u2208 Mn and \u03ba\u03a9n (A; B) = 0, then there is\na polynomial mapping p : C \u2192 \u03a9n of degree at most n with p(0) = A,\np\u2032 (0) = B and sp(p(\u03bb)) = sp(A) for any \u03bb \u2208 C.\nTo support this conjecture, we shall prove it for n = 2.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. The proof of Proposition 4 is given in Section 4. Section 5 contains the proofs of Propositions\n5, 6 and 8, as well as Conjecture 9 for n = 2. The proof of Proposition\n3 is discussed in Section 4.\n2. Proof of Proposition 4\nWe shall need the following\nProposition 10. (i) If A, B \u2208 \u03a9n , then\n\nlGn (\u03c3(A), \u03c3(B)) \u2264 l\u03a9n (A, B) \u2264 min max m(\u03bbj , \u03bc\u03c0(j) ),\n\u03c0\n\n1\u2264j\u2264n\n\nwhere sp(A) = {\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbn }, sp(B) = {\u03bc1 , . . . , \u03bcn }, and the minimum\nis taken over all permutations \u03c0 of {1, . . . , n}.\n(ii) (see Theorem 5.2 in [7]) If the eigenvalues of B(z) \u2208 O(D, \u03a9n )\n1\u2212\u03b1 z\u2212\u03b1\nhave the form ei\u03b8 1\u2212\u03b1jj 1\u2212z\u03b1jj , then\nlGn (\u03c3(B(z)), \u03c3(B(w))) = l\u03a9n (B(z), B(w)) = m(z, w).\n(iii) If B \u2208 \u03a9n and t \u2208 D, then the eigenvalues of B are equal if and\nonly if\nlGn (\u03c3(tI), \u03c3(B)) = max m(t, \u03bb).\n\u03bb\u2208sp(B)\n\nRemark. One may conjecture that Proposition 10 (ii) describes all\nthe possibilities for the equality\nlGn (\u03c3(A), \u03c3(B)) = min\n\nmax m(\u03bb, \u03bc).\n\n\u03bb\u2208sp(A) \u03bc\u2208sp(B)\n\nAssuming Proposition 10 (iii), we are ready to prove Proposition 4.\nThe implication (ii) \u21d2 (iii) is trivial. For the rest of the proof we\nmay assume that t = 0.\nWe shall show that (i) \u21d2 (ii) for any B \u2208 \u03a9n . Let (Aj ) \u2192 0 and\n(Bj ) \u2192 B. Then, by Proposition 10 (iii) and (2),\nl\u03a9n (Aj , Bj ) \u2265 lGn (\u03c3(Aj ), \u03c3(Bj )) \u2192 lGn (0, \u03c3(B)) = r(B) = l\u03a9n (0, B).\n\n\fDISCONTINUITY OF THE LEMPERT FUNCTION OF THE SPECTRAL BALL 7\n\nThus the function l\u03a9n (*, B) is lower semicontinuous at the point (0, B).\nSince it is (always) upper semicontinuous, we conclude that it is continuous at this point.\nIt remains to prove that (iii) \u21d2 (i). Since Cn is a dense subset in \u03a9n ,\nwe may find Cn \u2283 (Aj ) \u2192 0. Then, by (2) and (1),\nr(B) = l\u03a9n (0, B) \u2190 l\u03a9n (Aj , B) = lGn (\u03c3(Aj ), \u03c3(B)) \u2192 lGn (0, \u03c3(B))\nand hence lGn (0, \u03c3(B)) = r(B). It follows by Proposition 10 (iii) that\nthe eigenvalues of B are equal.\nThis completes the proof of Proposition 4.\nProof of Proposition 10 (i). The first inequality is trivial.\nTo prove the second one recall that (see the footnote on page 2)\nl\u03a9n (A, B) = l\u03a9n (A\u2032 , B \u2032 ),\n\nA\u2032 \u223c A, B \u2032 \u223c B.\n\nSo we may assume A = (ajk ) and B = (bjk ) are Jordan matrices with\nmax m(ajj , bjj ) = s := min max m(\u03bbj , \u03bc\u03c0(j) ).\n\n1\u2264j\u2264n\n\n\u03c0\n\n1\u2264j\u2264n\n\nLet s1 > s. Then we may choose \u03c6jj \u2208 O(D, D) such that \u03c6jj (0) = ajj\nand \u03c6jj (s1 ) = bjj . For \u03b6 \u2208 C set\n\u001a\n0,\nj>k\n\u03c6jk (\u03b6) =\nbjk \u2212ajk\najk + s1 \u03b6, j < k.\nNow \u03c6 = (\u03c6jk ) \u2208 O(D, \u03a9n ) which shows that l\u03a9n (A, B) < s1 . Since\ns1 > s was arbitrary, we are done.\nRemark. Obvious modifications in the above proof imply Proposition\n7.\nProof of Proposition 10 (iii). If the eigenvalues of B are equal, say\nto \u03bb, then\nlGn (\u03c3(tI), \u03c3(B)) = m(t, \u03bb)\nby Proposition 10 (ii) with \u03b1j = 0 (or, directly, considering the mapping\n\u03b6 \u2192 \u03c3(\u03b6, . . . , \u03b6) shows that second inequality in Proposition 10 (i)\nbecomes equality).\nTo prove the converse, we shall need the following\nLemma 11. Let \u03b51 , . . . , \u03b5n \u2208 T = \u2202D be pairwise different points.\nThen for any \u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbn \u2208 D, there are \u03b2 \u2208 D and a Blaschke product\nB of order \u2264 n with B(0) = 0, B(\u03b51 \u03b2) = \u03bb1 , . . . , B(\u03b5n \u03b2) = \u03bbn .\nAssuming Lemma 11, we shall complete the proof of Proposition 10\n(iii).

On\nthe other hand, a0 6= 0 and thus k = n \u2212 1. It follows that B(z) = z n\nand then \u03bb1 = * * * = \u03bbn .\nProof of Lemma 11. Let S be the set of all \u03b2 \u2208 D for which\nthe Nevanlinna\u2013Pick problem with data (0, 0), (\u03b51\u03b2, \u03bb1), . . . , (\u03b5n \u03b2, \u03bbn )\nis solvable. We may assume that 0 6\u2208 S; otherwise, the identity mapping does the job. Then we must have f \u2208 O(D, D) with f (\u03b5j \u03b2) =\n\u03bbj\n, 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n. The existence of such a function is equiva\u03bb\u2032j :=\n\u03b5j \u03b2\nlent to the semi-positivity of the matrix A(\u03b2) = [aj,k (\u03b2)]nj,k=1, where\n1 \u2212 \u03bb\u2032j \u03bb\u0304\u2032k\naj,k (\u03b2) =\n. Observe that aj,k (*), j 6= k, is bounded on\n1 \u2212 \u03b5j \u03b5k |\u03b2|2\nD. On the other hand, lim aj,j (\u03b2) = +\u221e. Thus the matrix A(\u03b2) is\n\u03b2\u2192T\n\n\fDISCONTINUITY OF THE LEMPERT FUNCTION OF THE SPECTRAL BALL 9\n\n(strictly) positive for \u03b2 near T. Since 0 6\u2208 S, it follows that S is a\nproper non-empty (circular) closed subset of D. So there is a boundary\npoint \u03b20 \u2208 D of S. Then A(\u03b20 ) is not strictly positive which means\nthat m = rank(A(\u03b20 )) is not maximal, that is, m < n. This implies\nthat the respective Nevanlinna\u2013Pick problem has a unique solution\nand it is a Blaschke product B\u0303 of order m (cf. [10]). It remains to set\nB(\u03b6) = \u03b6 B\u0303(\u03b6).\n3. Proofs of Propositions 5, 6, 8 and Conjecture 9 for\nn = 2.\nProof of Proposition 5. The implication (ii) \u21d2 (iii) is trivial.

If A is derogatory, it is scalar.\nThen sp(B) = 0 and so the linear mapping \u03bb \u2192 A + \u03bbB does the job.\nLet A be non-derogatory.

Therefore it has the desired properties.\n4. Appendix: Proof of Proposition 3\nIn [11, definition 3.2.4.1, p. 135], property (4) is taken as the definition of nonderogatority. The fact that (4) implies (5) is [11, Theorem\n3.2.4.2, p. 135]. The converse implication is stated in [11, p. 137], and\nproved in [12, Corollary 4.4.18, p. 275]. The fact that (7) is equivalent\nto (4) is part of [12, Theorem 4.4.17, p. 275]. The equivalence between\n\n\fDISCONTINUITY OF THE LEMPERT FUNCTION OF THE SPECTRAL BALL11\n\n(1) and (3) is [11, Theorem 3.3.15, p. 147]. The equivalence of those\nproperties with (4) is left as an exercise immediately after this.\nFrom the form of a companion matrix, it is immediate that if we\ndenote by e1 the first basis vector, its iterates e1 , Ae1 , . . . , An\u22121e1 generate Cn , and similarity preserves thsi property. Conversely, if one has\na cyclic vector, it is easy to see that the space is actually generated by\nthe first n iterates as above, and that they must form a basis, in which\nthe matrix will take the companion form. So (2) is equivalent to (1).\nWe now move on to the statements about ranks. First note that\n\u03a6A (I + H) := (I + H)\u22121A(I + H) = A + (\u2212HA + AH) + O(H 2 ),\nso dim Ker((\u03a6A )\u2217,In ) = dim C(A), and, by the rank theorem, (8) is\nequivalent to (7). The comment about maximality follows from [12,\nTheorem 4.4.17(d), p. 275].\nTo study \u03c3\u2217,A , first note that for P \u2208 M\u22121\nn ,\n\u03c3\u2217,A (H) = \u03c3\u2217,P \u22121 AP (P \u22121HP ),\nso rank(\u03c3\u2217,A ) is preserved when we pass to a similar matrix. Thus,\nif A verifies (1), we may suppose then that it is a companion matrix.\nChoose H = (hi,j ) such that hi,j = 0, 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n \u2212 1. Then A + H is\nalso a companion matrix, and \u03c3 when restricted to that set is a linear\nmap in the last column. Then the mapping\n\u03c3\u2217,A (H) = (\u2212hn,n , hn\u22121,n , . . . , (\u22121)n\u22121 h1,n ),\nis onto Cn . So (6) follows by (1).\nTo complete the proof of Proposition 3, it is enough to show (6)\nimplies (4).\nGiven any \u03bb \u2208 C, let A\u03bb := A \u2212 \u03bbIn . Then PA (X) = PA\u03bb (X + \u03bb),\nso that \u03c3(A) is a polynomial expression (involving the parameter \u03bb) of\nthe components of \u03c3(A\u03bb ). Therefore rank(\u03c3\u2217,A ) \u2264 rank(\u03c3\u2217,A\u03bb ).\nSuppose now that property (6) holds and (4) does not. Let \u03bb be\nan eigenvalue such that dim Ker(A \u2212 \u03bbIn ) \u2265 2. Choose a basis of Cn\ncontaining a basis of Ker(A \u2212 \u03bbIn ). In this basis, the matrix A \u2212 \u03bbIn\ntransforms into a matrix with at least two columns which are identically zero, and therefore \u03c3n (A \u2212 \u03bbIn + H) is a polynomial containing only monomials of degree at least 2 in the hi,j . This implies that\n(\u03c3n )\u2217,A\u2212\u03bbIn = 0 and therefore\nrank(\u03c3\u2217,A ) \u2264 rank(\u03c3\u2217,A\u03bb In ) \u2264 n \u2212 1,\nwhich is a contradiction.\n\n\f12\n\nNIKOLAI NIKOLOV, PASCAL J.
