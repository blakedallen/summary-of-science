We found out, Josephson Junction (JJ) decoupling is the main origin of the AC\nresistivity in high Tc superconductors. We have measured the AC resistivity in the\nsuperconductors in the low frequency range by measuring the complex AC impedance of\nsuperconducting YBa2Cu3O7 (YBCO) polycrystalline samples. Our data shows that under\ncertain conditions when the number density of Josephson Junctions (JJ) present in the\nsample and the JJ critical current crosses a threshold value, AC resistivity in the\nsuperconducting state keeps on increasing with lowering temperature. The underlying\nmechanism is an interesting interplay of JJ coupling energy, amplitude of the supply AC\nvoltage and the current applied to the superconducting sample. The effect of the applied\nAC current of different frequencies and the variation of temperature were studied in\ndetail. To find out the exact relation between the JJ coupling energy, JJ number density,\napplied AC frequency, the amplitude of AC current and the AC resistivity in the\nsuperconductors, we have studied samples of different grain sizes, pressurized with\ndifferent pressure and sintered at different physical situations. These results have\nimportant implications for the understanding of the origin of AC resistivity and\ncharacterization of superconducting samples. In this paper we also extend the capability\nof the AC impedance studies in superconductors for the characterization of materials for\ndevice applications.\n\nKeywords: YBCO; AC impedance; Josephson Junction; superconductivity;\n\n2\n\n\fIntroduction:\nZero resistance in superconducting materials means that there is no voltage drop along\nthe material when a current is passed through, and by consequence no power is\ndissipated. This is, however, strictly true only for a DC current of constant value. This is\nnot true in case of AC. The exact reason for the appearance of resistance and the power\ndissipation in case of AC is not addressed properly in literatures. Passing AC in\nsuperconducting materials without dissipation is one of the major challenges for the\nvarious applications of superconductors. The application of a magnetic field and the\nvariation of temperature alter the AC penetration depth of the superconducting sample,\nwhich in turn changes the AC impedance associated with it. We have studied the AC\nresistivity of various superconductors to find out its origin in details. We found out, JJ\ndecoupling is one of the most important factors controlling the AC resistivity in\nsuperconducting samples. JJ decoupling is basically the breaking of a JJ to normal state\neither by applying current or magnetic field or heat energy. Energy is absorbed or emitted\nin the formation of annihilation or creation of the Josephson junctions in the prices of JJ\ndecoupling.\n\nThe AC-conductivity or resistivity in isotropic disorder systems has been extensively\nstudied [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], several experiments support the existence of unique relation in a\nvariety of materials, in either electronic [3, 7] or ionic [3, 4, 5, 6] or superconducting [8,\n9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18] systems. For both application and fundamental\nreasons, investigation of the frequency variation of the Ohmic and reactive components\nof the linear conductivity, \u03c3\u2032 + i\u03c3\u2032\u2032, represent one of the important approaches to\n\n3\n\n\funderstand the nature of high Tc superconductors. Ac-conductivity in superconducting\nsystem gives new phenomenon like non-Ohmic dissipative regime in YBCO [8],\nconducting coherence peak [9, 10] and the evidence of Bose-glass transition in\nsuperconductors [11, 12]. At low frequency, in most of the system AC resistivity is\nfrequency independent. In general it is expected that the AC or the DC resistivity in\nsuperconductors should decrease below Tc. In DC resistivity case the value of resistance\ngoes exactly to zero and in the case of AC resistivity it keeps on decreasing towards zero\nwith decreasing temperature. But surprisingly we found in certain type of\nsuperconducting samples, the AC resistivity drops very close to zero at the critical\ntemperature and instead of decreasing it increases slowly with decreasing temperature\nbelow the critical temperature, which property is also strongly dependent on the applied\nAC frequency. Investigation of the above phenomena gave us the information regarding\nthe contribution of JJ decoupling towards the AC resistivity of superconducting samples.\n\nMeasurements of the dynamic responses in superconductors just below the\nsuperconducting phase transition have provided important information on the nature of\nthe superconduting state. Complex AC conductivity has been measured in different\npolycrystalline YBCO sample at frequencies starting from 100 Hz to 100 kHz and\ntemperature 10 K to 300 K. Here we explain the results with the decoupling of Josephson\njunctions present in the superconducting samples. Transport-critical-current behavior and\nnon-Ohmic dissipative regime in superconducting YBCO is strongly affected by this JJ\ndecoupling [13, 14]. Josephson junctions are intrinsically present in all types of\nsuperconducting sample. It is found out that even single crystals made with almost all\n\n4\n\n\fcares are not free from intrinsic JJs or weak links. The number density of JJ depends on\nthe sample type and the sample quality. It also depends on the stoichiometry of sample\npreparation. The number density of JJ present in granular polycrystalline samples is more\nthan thin film and single crystalline samples. Contacts between the grains in\npolycrystalline samples and the defects, scratches and the layer structures in the single\ncrystalline samples are the main sources of Josephson junctions. The influence of the\nJosephson junction decoupling on the complex conductivity is studied in detail.\n\nThe electromagnetic absorption or the dissipation of any means inside the\nsuperconductors belongs to the same class of behavior as the AC resistivity.\nElectromagnetic absorption or the dissipation results from currents that are in phase with\nthe electric field and hence is proportional to Z\u2032, the real part of AC resistivity. So the\nelectromagnetic absorption can be expected to occur in Z\u2032 for all the frequencies well\nbelow the energy gap. JJ decoupling is one type of loss like the electromagnetic\nabsorption, which can also be represented as the AC resistance in the system. In the\npresent work, we have measured the AC loss due to the JJ decoupling and converted it to\nthe equivalent AC resistance for the system. In this way we have correlated the JJ\ndecoupling with the increase of the AC resistivity below Tc in certain superconductors.\n\nExperiment:\nIn our experiments we investigated in the high Tc cuprate superconductor YBCO. The\nYBCO powder used was made by solid-state reaction of reagent-grade Y2O3, BaCO3 and\nCuO. We prepared two pellets made of polycrystalline samples of YBCO. Both the\n\n5\n\n\fpellets were exactly similar in size and shape but prepared with different techniques. One\nof the two pellets (Sample 1) is perfectly sintered and all the precaution has been taken\ncare to minimize the presence of Josephson junctions in it whereas the other sample\n(Sample 2) is prepared keeping in mind to make it granular in nature and to enhance the\npossibilities of Josephson junctions. Both the pellets were prepared from the same phase\nof YBCO powder. First pellet was prepared from the YBCO powder after grinding\nfurther for 5 hours and pressurizing with a pressure of 2 tons. The second pellet was\nprepared from the same YBCO powder without grinding further but sintered at\ntemperature of 980 0C in flowing Oxygen for 8 hours. Both the samples show sharp\nsuperconducting transition temperature at ~91 K as determined by \u03c1~T and ac\nsusceptibility measurements. The materials were found to be single phasic as determined\nby x-ray diffraction. The SEM image of both the samples surfaces is shown in Fig. 1. The\nSEM image of sample 1 shows a much more dense YBCO microstructure than sample 2.\nThis dense microstructure in the sample 1 reduces the number density of JJs present in\nthe sample and also makes the existing JJs stronger. The granular nature in sample 2 is\nmore favorable for weak JJs. So in the sample 2 the number density of JJ is more than\nsample 1.\n\nFour terminal measurements were performed with a standard dual phase lock-in-amplifier\n(model SR830) with two-phase detections. The current and voltage leads were soldered\nonto the surface of the samples with silver paint contacts. The contact resistances were\nestimated to be below 2 \u03a9. The AC current was monitored across a standard resistor in\nseries with the sample, and the sample voltage was measured using the lock-in-amplifier.\n\n6\n\n\fThe sample was arranged inside an Oxford instrument cryostat. No precautions were\ntaken to expel the earth magnetic field. The AC resistivity measurement was performed\non both the sintered and non-sintered pellets (sample 1 and sample 2) having equal size.\nRectangular bars with dimensions of 11 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 mm were cut from the sample pellets for\nthe AC resistivity measurements. Extensive impedance studies have been performed from\n10 to 300 K. The resistivity was measured in the frequency range 100 Hz < f < 100 KHz.\nWe carefully checked the dispersive behavior of the leads using some standard cells\n(metallic samples with very low resistance) and ensured that there was no extraneous\ninductive or capacitive coupling in these frequencies ranges. Measurements were made\nafter stabilizing the temperature for about 10 min prior to each reading.\n\nResults & Discussion:\nFigure 2 shows the real part of the AC resistivity of both the samples (sample 1 and\nsample 2) measured at frequency of 100 KHz. The superconducting transitions are clearly\nvisible in both the samples at the temperature of 91 K. Just below transition temperature\nsample 1 shows AC resistivity nearly zero upto the temperature of 13 K, but the sample 2\nshows AC resistivity of 6.5 \u03bc\u03a9 cm at the temperature of 13 K and follows a\nAmbegaokar-Baratoff function for tunnel junction [19] like behavior below Tc. Inset of\nfigure 2 shows the clear picture of the AC conductivity below Tc upto 13 K. The\npolynomial fitting in the inset of figure 1 confirms that the plot nearly follows the\nAmbegaokar-Baratoff function. At normal state DC resistivity behavior for both the\nsamples follow the patterns of a standard YBCO sample. Sample 2 shows higher\nresistivity than sample 1, this may be due to the granular nature of the sample 2. To know\n\n7\n\n\fdetails about the frequency dependence of the real part of AC resistivity of the sample 2,\nwe have done experiments at various frequencies in between 100 Hz to 100 kHz. The AC\nresistivity below Tc for different frequencies is presented in Fig. 3. Here it is found that at\nall the higher frequencies, it follows nearly Ambegaokar-Baratoff function similar like\nthe inset of Fig. 1. The amplitude of the dependence increases with frequency. At lower\nfrequencies plots and also at the temperature just below Tc for all the plots, the behavior\ndoes not follow Ambeogkar-Baratoff function properly. This is either due to the low\nintensity of the signal buried by the background noise or the difference of the JJ tunnel\ncurrent behavior in high Tc superconductors with the Ambegaokar-Baratoff function. This\nis discussed in details latter. The behavior of the in-phase part of the resistivity (real\ncomponent) with frequency for both the samples is shown in Fig. 4 at the temperature of\n30 K. The in-phase part of the resistivity of the granular sample (sample 2) increases with\nfrequency in the range of frequency from 100Hz to 100 KHz with an average change of\n55 X 10-12 \u03a9 cm / Hz, but for the sintered sample (sample 1) the resistivity increases with\nan average change of only 4 X 10-12 \u03a9 cm / Hz. This is very less comparatively to the\nsample 1. But in both the cases the fitting is linear which shows the deep interconnection\nbetween the real part of the resistivity and the frequency of applied AC current.\n\nIt is important to understand the differences in the real part of the conductivity between\nboth the samples and their frequency dependences; we have given the following\nexplanation. Between the two superconducting samples, sample 1 is the standard\nsuperconducting sample, which shows the real part of the AC resistivity remains zero\nthroughout the superconducting state (Fig. 2). As it is already discussed that sample 2 is a\n\n8\n\n\fspecially prepared sample to enhance the number density of Josephson junctions and the\ngrain boundary weak links. Sample 2 can be model as an array of weakly Josephsoncoupled, strongly superconducting anisotropic grains. The intergranular weak links are\nnot only insulating barriers but instead proximity junctions, coupled via semiconducting,\nnormal conducting, or poorly superconducting materials. Due to the occurrence of the\nlarge number of weak Josephson junctions in the sample 2, JJ decoupling in the sample 2\nis more and due to this, it shows the real part of AC resistivity increases with lowering\ntemperature in the superconducting state (Fig. 2). To know more details lets explain how\nthese JJ decoupling gives these results; first let us consider what will happen to a single\nJosephson junction when we pass current more than its critical value. The obvious answer\nis it will break the junction and the junction will become normal. The AC current we\napply in the superconductor mostly flows in the surface of the superconducting sample\ndepending on the penetration depth \u03bb. So the AC current flow through out the surface of\nthe sample including the JJs present in the surface. Here we assume that the amount of\nAC current flowing in the sample wont be able to break all the JJs but only breaks the\nweaker JJs which have critical current less than the applied AC current. As earlier\ndiscussed each Josephson junction is associated with some coupling energy. This is\nknown as JJ decoupling energy. JJ decoupling energy Ej between neighboring grains is\ngiven by [14]\n\nE J (T , H ) =\n\nsin \u03c0\u03c6 / \u03c6 0\nh\nF (T )\u3008 I 0\n\u3009\n2e\n\u03c0\u03c6 0\n\n------- (Eq. 1)\n\n9\n\n\fWhere \u03a60 = ch/2e is the flux quantum and F(T) is a function of the temperature which in\nthe Ambegaokar-Baratoff theory [19] is given by...\nF(T) = {\u2206(T)/\u2206(0)} tanh {\u2206(T)/2KBT} ------------------- (Eq. 2)\nwith \u2206(T) the temperature dependent gap parameter and \u2206(0) the gap at T = 0; I0 is the\nmaximum Josephson current given by\nI0 =\n\n\u03c0\u039b (0)\neRn\n\n--------------- (Eq. 3)\n\nwith Rn the normal state resistance of the junction; \u03a6 = HAJ and AJ is the effective field\npenetration junction area orthogonal to H. In the average Eq. (1) refers to the statistical\ndistribution of the junction geometrical parameters. So once the Josephson junction\nbreaks, the system will absorb energy Ej, this is a function of both temperature and the\nmagnetic field. To make the experiment simple, we have eliminated the magnetic field H\ncontribution by keeping the field very near to zero. The exactly opposite situation will\nhappen when we reduce the current across the critical current. The JJ, which was\ndecoupled before by the application of higher current, will come back to its original\nsituation and the system will release exactly same amount of energy Ej just below Jc and\nwill become a Josephson junction again. If we pass an AC current in the Josephson\njunction having amplitude more than the critical current of Josephson junction then the\nsystem will absorb and release energy continuously as represented in the figure 5. At the\npoint 'a' the current passes through the junction is more than its critical value, so the\njunction will absorb energy and at the point 'b' it will emit the energy in the form of heat.\nSo the expression for the total energy absorbed by the sample per second or the total loss\ncan be expressed as P and P = 2fNEj (Eq. 4), where f is the frequency of the AC current,\n\n10\n\n\fN is the total number of Josephson junctions keeps on breaking and forming due to the\napplication of AC current and Ej is the JJ decoupling energy of a single JJ.\n\nThe total energy absorbed by the sample due to the passing of AC current is a measure of\nloss and can be converted as the resistance of the system. So using the simple relation P\n= I2R, where P is the total power, I is the applied current and R is the resistance of the\nsample, we can get the equivalent AC resistance Rac = P/I2 = (2fNEj/I2) -----(Eq. 5). So\nRac is proportional to the excess loss and, consequently, to the inverse quality factor Q-1.\nFrom this explanation (see Eq. 5) it is understood that if the sample have more JJs or\nhigher the JJ critical current (not more than the applied AC current because in that case\nthe JJ does not decouple) then the loss will be more and consequently the AC resistance\nwill be more. From the Fig. 1 it is clear that the sample 2 has more number of JJs than the\nsample 1, so it shows AC resistivity more and due to the presence of very less number of\nJJs in sample 1 it shows the AC resistivity very near to zero at the same range of\nfrequency. Now to explain the Ambeogkar-Baratoff (AB) pattern of the AC resistivity in\nthe sample 2, we have to look at the equation 2. From the equation 2 it is clear that the\ncritical current of a JJ and the Ej both follows the AB pattern. So the AC resistivity,\nwhich is a linear function of the JJ decoupling energy Ej, has to follow the AB pattern.\nJust to explain the temperature dependent AC resistivity (real part) of the granular YBCO\nsample (sample 2) at various frequencies (Fig. 4), we have to see the equation 5 again.\nFrom the equation 5 it is clear that the AC resistivity in the superconducting sample is\ndirectly proportional to the frequency of applied AC current. Increasing frequency makes\n\n11\n\n\fthe total number of JJ decoupling per second more so the energy loss or the AC resistivity\ndue to the JJ decoupling increases linearly with the applied frequency.\n\nHere in the above discussion we have assumed all the JJs to be have equal critical current\nbut in the real picture, there will be a distribution of JJ critical current for the whole JJs\nand that may be one of the reasons why the experimental curves discussed above do not\nfit exactly with the Ambeogkar-Baratoff function. The Ambeogkar-Baratoff function is\napplicable for a single Josepson junction. It is possible to give a model considering the\nwhole JJs network in the sample and its corresponding fit and the fit may exactly fit with\nthe experimental data. But the work is in progress and will be discussed in a forthcoming\npublication [20].\n\nConclusions:\nWe have intentionally varied microstructures of polycrystalline YBCO samples. We have\nobserved close correlation between AC conductivity and the microstructures of the\nsuperconducting sample. In the view of the discussion made in the previous section it is\nconcluded that the result of the study of the transport properties of the superconductor\nYBCO by AC impedance are consistent. In conclusion, we have observed a well-defined\nincrease in the real part of the finite-frequency AC resistivity in the granular\nsuperconductor. The AC response obtained below critical temperature in the granular\nsuperconducting sample is mainly due to the JJ decoupling. Which of this effect is\nresponsible for the difference between the resistivity and relaxation time remains to be\nseen. In conclusion, we have investigated the temperature and frequency dependence of\n\n12\n\n\fthe AC impedance properties of the superconducting samples and find out JJ decoupling\nto be one of the most important factors controlling the AC resistivity very much. As the\nAC impedance due to JJ decoupling is directly proportional to the applied AC frequency,\nat radio frequency and microwave frequency, it is expected to give bigger contribution.\n\nAcknowledgements:\nThis work is supported by the Department of Science and Technology, University Grants\nCommission and the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, Government of India.\n\nReferences:\n[1] J.

Jc is the\ncritical current of the Josephson junction. The black rectangular box is the voltagetime area where the JJ exists. The arrow indicates the exact position at which JJ\nannihilation and formation occurs. Energy equal to Ej is absorbed by the Josephson\njunction at the point \"a\" and the same amount of energy is released at the point \"b\".\nThe energy released at the point \"b\" dissipates to the sample in the form of heat\nenergy. This occurs twice at every cycle of AC current. One full cycle of AC gives\ntwo annihilations and two creations of the Josephson junction.
