GHRIST, J.B. VAN DEN BERG, AND R.C. VANDERVORST\nA BSTRACT. In the first half of the paper we construct a Morse-type theory on certain\nspaces of braid diagrams. We define a topological invariant of closed positive braids\nwhich is correlated with the existence of invariant sets of parabolic flows defined on discretized braid spaces. Parabolic flows, a type of one-dimensional lattice dynamics, evolve\nsingular braid diagrams in such a way as to decrease their topological complexity; algebraic lengths decrease monotonically. This topological invariant is derived from a MorseConley homotopy index.\nIn the second half of the paper we apply this technology to second order Lagrangians\nvia a discrete formulation of the variational problem. This culminates in a very general\nforcing theorem for the existence of infinitely many braid classes of closed orbits.\n\n1. P RELUDE\nIt is well-known that under the evolution of any scalar uniformly parabolic equation\nof the form\n(1)\n\nut = f (x, u, ux , uxx )\n\n;\n\n\u2202uxx f \u2265 \u03b4 > 0,\n\nthe graphs of two solutions u1 (x, t) and u2 (x, t) evolve in such a way that the number of\nintersections of the graphs does not increase in time. This principle, known in various\ncircles as \"comparison principle\" or \"lap number\" techniques, entwines the geometry\nof the graphs (uxx is a curvature term), the topology of the solutions (the intersection\nnumber is a local linking number), and the local dynamics of the PDE. This is a valuable approach for understanding local dynamics for a wide variety of flows exhibiting\nparabolic behavior with both classical [54] and contemporary [41, 5, 10, 19] implications.\nThis paper is an extension of this local technique to a global technique. One such\nwell-established globalization appears in the work of Angenent on curve-shortening [4]:\nevolving closed curves on a surface by curve shortening isolates the classes of curves\ndynamically and implies a monotonicity with respect to number of self-intersections.\nIn contrast, one could consider the following topological globalization. Superimposing the graphs of a collection of functions u\u03b1 (x) gives something which resembles the\nprojection of a topological braid onto the plane. Assume that the \"height\" of the strands\nabove the page is given by the slope u\u03b1\nx (x), or, equivalently, that all of the crossings\nin the projection are of the same sign (bottom-over-top): see Fig. 1[left]. Evolving these\nfunctions under a parabolic equation (with, say, boundary endpoints fixed) yields a flow\non a certain space of braid diagrams which has a topological monotonicity: linking can be\ndestroyed but not created. This establishes a partial ordering on the semigroup of positive\nDate: October 25, 2018.\nThe first author was supported by NSF DMS-9971629 and NSF DMS-0134408.

The idea of topological braid classes\nwith this partial ordering is a globalization of the lap number (which, in braid-theoretic\nterms becomes the length of the braid in the braid group under standard generators).\n1.1. Parabolic flows on spaces of braid diagrams. In this paper, we initiate the study\nof parabolic flows on spaces of braid diagrams. The particular braids in question will\nbe (a) positive \u2013 all crossings are considered to be of the same sign; (b) closed1 \u2013 the left\nand right sides are identified; and (c) discretized \u2013 or piecewise linear with fixed distance\nbetween \"anchor points,\" so as to avoid the analytic difficulties of working on infinite\ndimensional spaces of curves. See Fig. 1 for examples of braid diagrams.\n\nPSfrag replacements u\n\nu\n\nx\n\nu\n\nux\n\nx\n\nx\n\nF IGURE 1. Curves in the x \u2212 u plane [left] lift to a braid [center] which\nis then discretized [right]. In a discretized isotopy, one slides the anchor\npoints vertically.\nThe flows we consider evolve the anchor points of the braid diagram so that the braid\nclass can change, but only so as to decrease complexity: local linking of strands may not\nincrease with time. Due to the close similarity with parabolic partial differential equations such systems will be referred to as parabolic recurrence relations, and the induced\nflows as parabolic flows. These flows are given by\nd\nui = Ri (ui\u22121 , ui , ui+1 ),\ndt\nwhere the variables ui represent the vertical positions of the ordered anchor points of\ndiscrete braid diagrams. The only conditions imposed on the dynamics is the monotonicity condition that every Ri be increasing functions of ui\u22121 and ui+1 .\nWhile a discretization of a PDE of the form (1) with nearest-neighbor interaction\nyields a parabolic recurrence relation, the class of dynamics we consider is significantly\nlarger in scope (see, e.g., [40]). Parabolic recurrence relations are a sub-class of monotone\nrecurrence relations as studied in [3] and [26].\nThe evolution of braid diagrams yields a situation not unlike that considered by Vassiliev in knot theory [59]: in our scenario, the space of all braid diagrams is partitioned\nby the discriminant of singular diagrams into the braid classes. The parabolic flows\nwe consider are transverse to these singular varieties (except for a set of \"collapsed\"\nbraids) and are co-oriented in a direction along which the algebraic length of the braid\ndecreases: this is an algebraic version of curve shortening.\nTo proceed, two types of noncompactness on spaces of braid diagrams must be repaired. Most severe is the problem of braid strands completely collapsing onto one\n(2)\n\n1The theory works equally well for braids with fixed endpoints.\n\n\fMORSE THEORY ON SPACES OF BRAIDS\n\n3\n\nanother. To resolve this type of noncompactness, we assume that the dynamics fixes\nsome collection of braid strands, a skeleton, and then work on spaces of braid pairs:\none free, one fixed. The relative theory then leads to forcing results of the type \"Given\na stationary braid class, which other braids are forced as invariant sets of parabolic\nflows?\" The second type of noncompactness in the dynamics occurs when the braid\nstrands are free to evolve to arbitrarily large values. In the PDE setting, one requires\nknowledge of boundary conditions at infinity to prove theorems about the dynamics. In\nour braid-theoretic context, we convert boundary conditions to \"artificial\" braid strands\naugmented to the fixed skeleton.\nThus, working on spaces of braid pairs, the dynamics at the discriminant permits the\nconstruction of a Morse theory in the spirit of Conley to detect invariant sets of parabolic flows. Conley's extension of the Morse index associates to any sufficiently isolated\ninvariant set a space whose homotopy type measures not merely the dimension of the\nunstable manifold (the Morse index) but rather the coarse topological features of the unstable dynamics associated to this set. We obtain a well-defined Conley index for braid\ndiagrams from the monotonicity properties of parabolic flows. To be more precise, relative braid classes (equivalence classes of isotopic braid diagrams fixing some skeleton)\nserve as candidates for isolating neighborhoods to which the Conley index can be assigned. This approach is reminiscent of the ideas of linking of periodic orbits used by\nAngenent [2, 4] and LeCalvez [36, 37].\nOur finite-dimensional approximations to the (infinite-dimensional) space of smooth\ntopological braids conceivably alter the Morse-theoretic properties of the discretized\nbraid classes. One would like to know that so long as the discretization is not degenerately coarse, the homotopy index is independent of both the discretization and the\nspecific parabolic flow employed. This is true. The principal topological result of this\nwork is that the homotopy index is indeed an invariant of the topological (relative)\nbraid class: see Theorems 19 and 20 for details. These theorems seem to evade a simple\nalgebraic-topological proof. The proof we employ in \u00a75 constructs the appropriate homotopy by recasting the problem into singular dynamics and applying techniques from\nsingular perturbation theory.\nWe thus obtain a topological index which can, like the Morse index, force the existence of invariant sets. Specifically, a non-vanishing homotopy index for a relative\nbraid class indicates that there is an invariant set in this braid class for any parabolic\nflow with the appropriate skeleton. This is the foundation for the applications to follow\nin the remainder of the paper.\nThe remainder of the paper explores applications of the machinery to a broad class\nof Lagrangian dynamics.\n1.2. Second order Lagrangian dynamics. Our principal application of the Morse theory on discretized braids is to the problem of finding periodic orbits of second order\nLagrangian systems: that is, Lagrangians of the form L(u, ux, uxx ) where L \u2208 C 2 (R3 ).\nAn important motivation for studying such systems comes from the stationary SwiftHohenberg model in physics, which is described by the fourth order equation\n!2\nd2\n(3)\n1 + 2 u \u2212 \u03b1u + u3 = 0, \u03b1 \u2208 R.\ndx\n\n\f4\n\nR.W. GHRIST, J.B. VAN DEN BERG, AND R.C. VANDERVORST\n\nThis equation is the Euler-Lagrange equation of the second order Lagrangian\n1\n1\u2212\u03b1 2 1 4\n(4)\nL(u, ux , uxx ) = |uxx |2 \u2212 |ux |2 +\nu + u .\n2\n2\n4\nWe generalize to the broadest possible class of second order Lagrangians. One begins\n2\nwith the conventional convexity assumption, \u2202w\nL(u, v, w) \u2265 \u03b4 > 0. The objective is\nto find Rbounded functions u : R \u2192 R which are stationary for the action integral\nJ[u] := L(u, ux, uxx )dx. Such functions u are bounded solutions of the Euler-Lagrange\nequations\n\nd \u2202L\n\u2202L\nd2 \u2202L\n\u2212\n+\n= 0.\ndx2 \u2202uxx dx \u2202ux\n\u2202u\nDue to the translation invariance x 7\u2192 x + c, the solutions of (5) satisfy the energy\nconstraint\n\u0010 \u2202L\n\u2202L\nd \u2202L \u0011\nux +\n\u2212\nuxx \u2212 L(u, ux, uxx ) = E = constant,\n(6)\n\u2202ux dx \u2202uxx\n\u2202uxx\nwhere E is the energy of a solution. To find bounded solutions for given values of E,\n\u0001\nRT\nwe employ the variational principle \u03b4u,T 0 L(u, ux , uxx ) + E dx = 0, which forces\nsolutions of (5) to have energy E. The Lagrangian problem can be reformulated as a\ntwo degree-of-freedom Hamiltonian system; in that context, bounded periodic solutions\nare closed characteristics of the (corresponding) energy manifold M 3 \u2282 R4 . Unlike the\ncase of first-order Lagrangian systems, the energy hypersurface is not of contact type in\ngeneral [6], and the recent stunning results in contact homology [16] are inapplicable.\nThe variational principle can be discretized for a certain considerable class of second\norder Lagrangians: those for which monotone laps between consecutive extrema {ui }\nare unique and continuous with respect to the endpoints. We give a precise definition in\n\u00a78, denoting these as (second order Lagrangian) twist systems. Due to the energy identity (6) the extrema {ui } are restricted to the set UE = {u | L(u, 0, 0) + E \u2265 0}, connected\ncomponents of which are called interval components and denoted by IE . An energy level\nis called regular if \u2202L\n\u2202u (u, 0, 0) 6= 0 for all u satisfying L(u, 0, 0) + E = 0. In order to\ndeal with non-compact interval components IE certain asymptotic behavior has to be\nspecified, for example that \"infinity\" is attracting. Such Lagrangians are called dissipative, and are most common in models coming from physics, like the Swift-Hohenberg\nLagrangian. For a precise definition of dissipativity see \u00a79. Other asymptotic behaviors\nmay be considered as well, such as \"infinity\" is repelling, or more generally that infinity\nis isolating, implying that closed characteristics are a priori bounded in L\u221e .\nClosed characteristics are either simple or non-simple depending on whether u(x), represented as a closed curve in the (u, ux )-plane, is a simple closed curve or not. This\ndistinction is a sufficient language for the following general forcing theorem:\n(5)\n\nTheorem 1. Any dissipative twist system possessing a non-simple closed characteristic u(x) at\na regular energy value E such that u(x) \u2208 IE , must possess an infinite number of (non-isotopic)\nclosed characteristics at the same energy level as u(x).\nThis is the optimal type of forcing result: there are neither hidden assumptions about\nnondegeneracy of the orbits, nor restrictions to generic behavior. Sharpness comes from\nthe fact that there exist systems with finitely many simple closed characteristics at each\nenergy level.\n\n\fMORSE THEORY ON SPACES OF BRAIDS\n\n5\n\nThe above result raises the following question: when does an energy manifold contain a non-simple closed characteristic? In general the existence of such characteristics\ndepends on the geometry of the energy manifold. One geometric property that sparks\nthe existence of non-simple closed characteristics is a singularity or near-singularity of\nthe energy manifold. This, coupled with Theorem 1, triggers the existence of infinitely\nmany closed characteristics. The results that can be proved in this context (dissipative twist systems) give a complete classification with respect to the existence of finitely\nmany versus infinitely many closed characteristics on singular energy levels. The first\nresult in this direction deals with singular energy values for which IE = R.\nTheorem 2. Suppose that a dissipative twist system has a singular energy level E with IE = R,\nwhich contains two or more rest points. Then the system has infinitely many closed characteristics at energy level E.2\nComplementary to the above situation is the case when IE contains exactly one rest\npoint. To have infinitely many closed characteristics, the nature of the rest point will\ncome into play. If the rest point is a center (four imaginary eigenvalues), then the system has\ninfinitely many closed characteristics at each energy level sufficiently close to E, including E. If\nthe rest point is not a center, there need not exist infinitely many closed characteristics\nas results in [57] indicate.\nSimilar results can be proved for compact interval components (for which dissipativity is irrelevant) and semi-infinite interval components IE \u2243 R\u00b1 .\nTheorem 3. Suppose that a dissipative twist system has a singular energy level E with an\ninterval component IE = [a, b], or IE \u2243 R\u00b1 , which contains at least one rest point of saddlefocus/center type. Then the system has infinitely many closed characteristics at energy level\nE.\nIf an interval component contains no rest points, or only degenerate rest points (0\neigenvalues), then there need not exist infinitely many closed characteristics, completing our classification.\nThis classification immediately applies to the Swift-Hohenberg model (3), which is a\ntwist system for all parameter values \u03b1 \u2208 R. We leave it to the reader to apply the above\ntheorems to the different regimes of \u03b1.\n1.3. Additional applications. The framework of parabolic recurrence relations that we\nconstruct is robust enough to accommodate several other important classes of dynamics.\n1.3.1. First-order nonautonomous Lagrangians.\nFinding periodic solutions of first-order\nR\nLagrangian systems of the form \u03b4 L(x, u, ux )dx = 0, with L being 1-periodic in x, can\nbe rephrased in terms of parabolic recurrence relations of gradient type. The homotopy\nindex can be used to find periodic solutions u(x) in this setting, even though a globally\ndefined Poincar\u00e9 map on R2 need not exist.\n2From the proof of this theorem in \u00a79 it follows that the statement remains true for energy values E + c,\nwith c > 0 small.\n\n\f6\n\nR.W. GHRIST, J.B. VAN DEN BERG, AND R.C. VANDERVORST\n\n1.3.2. Monotone twist maps. A monotone twist map (compare [3, 48]) is a (not necessarily\narea-preserving) map on R2 of the form\n(u, pu ) \u2192 (u\u2032 , p\u2032u ),\n\n\u2202u\u2032\n> 0.\n\u2202pu\n\nPeriodic orbits {(ui , pui )} are found by solving a parabolic recurrence relation for the\nu-coordinates derived from the twist property.\n1.3.3. Uniformly parabolic PDE's. The study of the invariant dynamics of Equation (1)\ncan also be formulated in terms of parabolic recurrence relations by a spatial discretization. The basic theory for braid forcing developed here can be adapted to the dynamics\nof Equation (1): see [24] for details.\n1.3.4. Lattice dynamics. The form of a parabolic recurrence relation is precisely that arising from a set of coupled oscillators on a [periodic] one-dimensional lattice with nearestneighbor attractive coupling. A similar setup arises in Aubry-LeDaeron-Mather theory\nof the Frenkel-Kontorova model [7]. In this setting, a nontrivial homotopy index yields\nexistence of invariant states (or stationary, in the exact context) within a particular braid\nclass. Related physical systems (e.g., charge density waves on a 1-d lattice [45]) are also\noften reducible to parabolic recurrence relations.\n1.4. History and outline. The history of our approach is the convergence of ideas from\nknot theory, the dynamics of annulus twist maps, and curve shortening. We have already mentioned the similarities with Vassiliev's topological approach to discriminants\nin the space of immersed knots. From the dynamical systems perspective, the study\nof parabolic flows and gradient flows in relation with embedding data and the Conley index can be found in work of Angenent [2, 3, 4] and Le Calvez [36, 37] on area\npreserving twist maps. More general studies of dynamical properties of parabolic-type\nflows appear in numerous works: we have been inspired by the work of Smillie [53],\nMallet-Paret and Smith [39], Hirsch [26], and, most strongly, the work of Angenent on\ncurve shortening [4]. Many of our applications to finding closed characteristics of second order Lagrangian systems share similar goals with the programme of Hofer and\nhis collaborators (see, e.g., [16, 27, 28]), with the novelty that our energy surfaces are all\nnon-compact and not necessarily of contact type [6].\nClearly there is a parallel between the homotopy index theory presented here and\nBoyland's adaptation of Nielsen-Thurston theory for braid types of surface diffeomorphisms [9]. An important difference is that we require compactness only at the level of\nbraid diagrams, which does not yield compactness on the level of the domains of the\nreturn maps [if these indeed exist]. Another important observation is that the recurrence relations are sometimes not defined on all of R2 , which makes it very hard if not\nimpossible to rephrase the problem of finding periodic solutions in terms of fixed points\nof 2-dimensional maps.\nThere are three components of this paper: (a) the precise definitions of the spaces\ninvolved and flows constructed, covered in \u00a72-\u00a73; (b) the establishment of existence,\ninvariance, and properties of the index for braid diagrams in \u00a74-\u00a77; and (c) applications\nof the machinery to second order Lagrangian systems \u00a78-\u00a710. Finally, \u00a711 contains open\nquestions and remarks.\n\n\fMORSE THEORY ON SPACES OF BRAIDS\n\n7\n\nAcknowledgments.

A braid \u03b2 on n strands is a collection of embeddings {\u03b2 \u03b1 : [0, 1] \u2192 R3 }n\u03b1=1\nwith disjoint images such that (a) \u03b2 \u03b1 (0) = (0, \u03b1, 0); (b) \u03b2 \u03b1 (1) = (1, \u03c4 (\u03b1), 0) for some permutation \u03c4 ; and (c) the image of each \u03b2 \u03b1 is transverse to all planes {x = const}. We will\n\"read\" braids from left to right with respect to the x-coordinate. Two such braids are\nsaid to be of the same topological braid class if they are homotopic in the space of braids:\none can deform one braid to the other without any intersections among the strands.\nThere is a natural group structure on the space of topological braids with n strands, Bn ,\ngiven by concatenation. Using generators \u03c3i which interchange the ith and (i + 1)st\nstrands (with a positive crossing) yields the presentation for Bn :\n\u001c\n\u001d\n\u03c3i \u03c3j = \u03c3j \u03c3i\n; |i \u2212 j| > 1\n(7)\nBn := \u03c31 , . . . , \u03c3n\u22121 :\n.\n\u03c3i \u03c3i+1 \u03c3i = \u03c3i+1 \u03c3i \u03c3i+1 ; i < n \u2212 1\nBraids find their greatest applications in knot theory via taking their closures. Algebraically, the closed braids on n strands can be defined as the set of conjugacy classes3 in\nBn . Geometrically, one quotients out the range of the braid embeddings via the equivalence relation (0, y, z) \u223c (1, y, z) and alters the restriction (a) and (b) of the position\nof the endpoints to be \u03b2 \u03b1 (0) \u223c \u03b2 \u03c4 (\u03b1) (1), as in Fig. 1[center]. Thus, a closed braid is a\ncollection of disjoint embedded loops in S 1 \u00d7 R2 which are everywhere transverse to\nthe R2 -planes.\n3Note that we fix the number of strands and do not allow the Markov move commonly used in knot theory.\n\n\f8\n\nR.W. GHRIST, J.B. VAN DEN BERG, AND R.C. VANDERVORST\n\nThe specification of a topological braid class (closed or otherwise) may be accomplished unambiguously by a labeled projection to the (x, y)-plane: a braid diagram. Any\nbraid may be perturbed slightly so that pairs of strand crossings in the projection are\ntransversal: in this case, a marking of (+) or (\u2212) serves to indicate whether the crossing is \"bottom over top\" or \"top over bottom\" respectively. Fig. 1[center] illustrates a\ntopological braid with all crossings positive.\n2.2. Discretized braids. In the sequel we will restrict to a class of closed braid diagrams\nwhich have two special properties: (a) they are positive - that is, all crossings are of (+)\ntype; and (b) they are discretized, or piecewise linear diagrams with constraints on the\npositions of anchor points. We parameterize such diagrams by the configuration space\nof anchor points.\nDefinition 4. The space of discretized period d braids on n strands, denoted Ddn , is the space\nof all pairs (u, \u03c4 ) where \u03c4 \u2208 Sn is a permutation on n elements, and u is an unordered collection\nof n strands, u = {u\u03b1 }n\u03b1=1 , satisfying the following conditions:\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\nd+1\n(a) Each strand consists of d + 1 anchor points: u\u03b1 = (u\u03b1\n.\n0 , u1 , . . . , ud ) \u2208 R\n(b) For all \u03b1 = 1, . . . , n, one has\n\u03c4 (\u03b1)\n\nu\u03b1\nd = u0\n\n.\n\n(c) The following transversality condition is satisfied: for any pair of distinct strands \u03b1\n\u03b1\u2032\nand \u03b1\u2032 such that u\u03b1\ni = ui for some i,\n\u0001\n\u0001 \u03b1\n\u03b1\u2032\n\u03b1\u2032\n(8)\nu\u03b1\ni\u22121 \u2212 ui\u22121 ui+1 \u2212 ui+1 < 0.\n\nThe topology on Ddn is the standard topology of Rn+1 on the strands and the discrete topology\nwith respect to the permutation \u03c4 , modulo permutations which change orderings of strands.\nSpecifically, two discretized braids (u, \u03c4 ) and (\u0169, \u03c4\u0303 ) are close iff for some permutation \u03c3 \u2208 Sn\none has u\u03c3(\u03b1) close to \u0169\u03b1 (as points in Rn+1 ) for all \u03b1, with \u03c3 \u25e6 \u03c4\u0303 = \u03c4 \u25e6 \u03c3.\nRemark 5. In Equation (8), and indeed throughout the paper, all expressions involving\ncoordinates ui are considered mod the permutation \u03c4 at d; thus, for every j \u2208 Z, we\nrecursively define\n(9)\n\nu\u03b1\nd+j\n\n:=\n\n\u03c4 (\u03b1)\n\nuj\n\n.\n\nAs a point of notation, subscripts always refer to the spatial discretization and superscripts always denote strands. For simplicity, we will henceforth suppress the \u03c4 portion\nof a discretized braid u.\nOne associates to each configuration u \u2208 Ddn the braid diagram \u03b2(u), given as follows.\nFor each strand u\u03b1 \u2208 u, consider the piecewise-linear (PL) interpolation\n(10)\n\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u03b2 \u03b1 (s) := u\u03b1\n\u230ad*s\u230b + (d * s \u2212 \u230ad * s\u230b)(u\u2308d*s\u2309 \u2212 u\u230ad*s\u230b ),\n\nfor s \u2208 [0, 1]. The braid diagram \u03b2(u) is then defined to be the superimposed graphs of\nall the functions \u03b2 \u03b1 , as illustrated in Fig. 1[right] for a period six braid on four strands\n(crossings are shown merely for suggestive purposes).\nThis explains the transversality condition of Equation (8): a failure of this equation\nto hold implies that there is a PL-tangency in the associated braid diagram. Since all\ncrossings in a discretized braid diagram are PL-transverse, the map \u03b2(*) sends u to a\n\n\fMORSE THEORY ON SPACES OF BRAIDS\n\n9\n\ntopological closed braid diagram once a convention for crossings is chosen. Inspired by\nlifting smooth curves to a 1-jet extension, we label all crossings of \u03b2(u) as positive type.\nThis can be thought of as using the slope of the PL-extension of u as the \"height\" of the\nbraid strand (though this analogy breaks down at the sharp corners). With this convention, then, the space Ddn embeds into the space of all closed positive braid diagrams on\nn strands.\nDefinition 6. Two discretized braids u, u\u2032 \u2208 Ddn are of the same discretized braid class,\ndenoted [u] = [u\u2032 ], if and only if they are in the same path-component of Ddn . The topological\nbraid class, {u}, denotes the path component of \u03b2(u) in the space of positive topological braid\ndiagrams.\nThe proof of the following lemma is essentially obvious.\nLemma 7. If [u] = [u\u2032 ] in Ddn , then the induced positive braid diagrams \u03b2 and \u03b2 \u2032 correspond\nto isotopic closed topological braid diagrams.\nThe converse to this Lemma is not true: two discretizations of a topological braid are\nnot necessarily connected in Ddn .\nSince one can write the generators \u03c3i of the braid group Bn as elements of D1n , it is\nclear that all positive topological braids are representable as discretized braids. Likewise, the relations for the groups of positive closed braids can be accomplished by moving within the space of discretized braids; hence, this setting suffices to capture all the\nrelevant braid theory we will use.\n2.3. Singular braids. The appropriate discriminant for completing the space Ddn consists of those \"singular\" braid diagrams admitting tangencies between strands.\nDefinition 8. Denote by D\u0304dn the nd-dimensional vector space4 of all discretized braid diagrams\nu which satisfy properties (a) and (b) of Definition 4. Denote by \u03a3nd := D\u0304dn \u2212 Ddn the set of\nsingular discretized braids.\nWe will often suppress the period and strand data and write \u03a3 for the space of singular discretized braids. It follows from Definition 4 and Equation (8) that the set \u03a3nd is\na semi-algebraic variety in D \u0304dn . Specifically, for any singular braid u \u2208 \u03a3 there exists an\n\u03b1\u2032\ninteger i \u2208 {1, . . . , d} and indices \u03b1 6= \u03b1\u2032 such that u\u03b1\ni = ui , and\n\u0001\n\u0001 \u03b1\n\u03b1\u2032\n\u03b1\u2032\n(11)\nu\u03b1\ni\u22121 \u2212 ui\u22121 ui+1 \u2212 ui+1 \u2265 0,\n\nwhere the subscript is always computed mod the permutation \u03c4 at d. The number of\nsuch distinct occurrences is the codimension of the singular braid diagram u \u2208 \u03a3. We\ndecompose \u03a3 into the union of strata \u03a3[m] graded by m, the codimension of the singularity.\nAny closed braid (discretized or topological) is partitioned into components by the\npermutation \u03c4 . Geometrically, the components are precisely the connected components\nof the closed braid diagram. In our context, a component of a discretized braid can be\nspecified as {u\u03b1\ni }i\u2208Z , since, by our indexing convention, i \"wraps around\" to the other\nside of the braid when i 6\u2208 {1, . . . , d}.\n4 Strictly speaking D\u0304 n is not a vector space, but a union of vector spaces. Fixing appropriate permutations\nd\nits components are vector spaces. Consider for instance D\u030413 which is a union of 3 copies of R3 .\n\n\f10\n\nR.W. GHRIST, J.B. VAN DEN BERG, AND R.C. VANDERVORST\n\nFor singular braid diagrams of sufficiently high codimension, entire components of\nthe braid diagram can coalesce. This can happen in essentially two ways: (1) a single\ncomponent involving multiple strands can collapse into a braid with fewer numbers of\nstrands, or (2) distinct components can coalesce into a single component. We define the\ncollapsed singularities, \u03a3\u2212 , as follows:\n\u2032\n\n\u03b1\n\u2032\n\u03a3\u2212 := {u \u2208 \u03a3 | u\u03b1\ni = ui , \u2200i \u2208 Z, for some \u03b1 6= \u03b1 } \u2282 \u03a3.\n\nClearly the codimension of singularities in \u03a3\u2212 is at least d. Since for braid diagrams in\n\u03a3\u2212 the number of strands reduces, the subspace \u03a3\u2212 may be decomposed into a union\n\u2032\n\u2032\nof the spaces D\u0304dn for n\u2032 < n; i.e., \u03a3\u2212 = \u222an\u2032 <n D\u0304dn . If n = 1, then \u03a3\u2212 = \u2205.\n2.4. Relative braid classes. Evolving certain components of a braid diagram while fixing the remaining components motivates working with a class of \"relative\" braid diagrams.\nGiven u \u2208 D\u0304dn and v \u2208 D\u0304dm , the union u \u222a v \u2208 D\u0304dn+m is naturally defined as the\nunordered union of the strands. Given v \u2208 Ddm , define\nDdn\n\nREL\n\nv := {u \u2208 Ddn : u \u222a v \u2208 Ddn+m },\n\nfixing v and imposing transversality. The path components of Ddn REL v comprise the\nrelative discrete braid classes, denoted [u REL v]. The braid v will be called the skeleton\nhenceforth. The set of singular braids \u03a3 REL v are those braids u such that u \u222a v \u2208 \u03a3n+m\nd\nThe collapsed singular braids are denoted by \u03a3\u2212 REL v. As before, the set (Ddn REL v) \u222a\n(\u03a3 REL v) is the closure of Ddn REL v in Rnd , and is denoted D\u0304dn REL v. We denote by\n{u REL v} the topological relative braid class: the set of topological (positive, closed)\nbraids u such that u \u222a v is a topological (positive, closed) braid diagram.\nGiven two relative braid classes [u REL v] and [u\u2032 REL v\u2032 ] in Ddn REL v and Ddn REL v\u2032\nrespectively, to what extend are they the same? Consider the set\nD = {(u, v) \u2208 Ddn \u00d7 Ddm | u \u222a v \u2208 Ddn+m }.\nThe natural projection \u03c0 : (u, v) \u2192 v from D to Ddm has \u0002as its fiber\u0003 the braid class\n[u REL v]. The path component of (u, v) in D will be denoted u REL [v] . This generates\nthe equivalence relation for relative braid \u0002classes to\u0003be \u0002used in the\u0003 remainder of this\nwork: [u REL v] \u223c [u\b\u2032 REL v\u2032 ] if and only if u REL [v] = u\u2032 REL [v\u2032 ] .\nLikewise, define u REL {v} to be the set of equivalent topological relative braid\nclasses. That is, {u REL v} \u223c {u\u2032 REL v\u2032 } if and only if there is a continuous family of\ntopological (positive, closed) braid diagram pairs deforming (u, v) to (u\u2032 , v\u2032 ).\n3. PARABOLIC\n\nRECURRENCE RELATIONS\n\nWe consider the dynamics of vector fields given by recurrence relations on the spaces\nof discretized braid diagrams. These recurrence relations are nearest neighbor interactions - each anchor point on a braid strand influences anchor points to the immediate\nleft and right on that strand - and resemble spatial discretizations of parabolic equations.\n\n\fMORSE THEORY ON SPACES OF BRAIDS\n\n11\n\n3.1. Axioms and exactness. Denote by X the sequence space X := RZ .\nDefinition 9. A parabolic recurrence relation R on X is a sequence of real-valued C 1 functions R = (Ri )i\u2208Z satisfying\n(A1): [monotonicity]5 \u22021 Ri > 0 and \u22023 Ri \u2265 0 for all i \u2208 Z\n(A2): [periodicity] For some d \u2208 N, Ri+d = Ri for all i \u2208 Z.\n\nFor applications to Lagrangian dynamics a variational structure is necessary. At the\nlevel of recurrence relations this implies that R is a gradient:\nDefinition 10. A parabolic recurrence relation on X is called exact if\n(A3): [exactness] There exists a sequence of C 2 generating functions, (Si )i\u2208Z , satisfying\n(12)\n\nRi (ui\u22121 , ui , ui+1 ) = \u22022 Si\u22121 (ui\u22121 , ui ) + \u22021 Si (ui , ui+1 ),\n\nfor all i \u2208 Z.\n\nIn discretized Lagrangian problems the action functional naturally defines the generating\nfunctions Si . This agrees with the \"formal\" action in this case: W (u) :=\nP\nS\n(u\ni i i , ui+1 ). In this general setting, R = \u2207W .\n\n3.2. The induced flow. In order to define parabolic flows we regard R as a vector field\non X: consider the differential equations\n\nd\nui = Ri (ui\u22121 , ui , ui+1 ), u(t) \u2208 X, t \u2208 R.\ndt\nEquation (13) defines a (local) C 1 flow \u03c8 t on X under any periodic boundary conditions\nwith period nd. To define flows on the finite dimensional spaces D\u0304dn , one considers the\nsame equations:\n(13)\n\nd \u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\nu = Ri (u\u03b1\nu \u2208 D\u0304dn .\ni\u22121 , ui , ui+1 ),\ndt i\nwhere the ends of the braid are identified as per Remark 5. Axiom (A2) guarantees\nthat the flow is well-defined. Indeed, one may consider a cover of D\u0304dn by taking the biinfinite periodic extension of the braids: this yields a subspace of periodic sequences in\nXn := X \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 X invariant under the product flow of (13) thanks to Axiom (A2). Any\nflow \u03a8t generated by (14) for some parabolic recurrence relation R is called a parabolic\nflow on discretized braids. In the case of relative classes D\u0304dn REL v a parabolic flow is the\nrestriction of a parabolic flow on D\u0304dn+m which fixes the anchor points of the skeleton v.\nWe abuse notation and indicate the invariance of the skeleton by \u03a8t (v) = v. Indeed, for\nappropriate coverings of the skeletal strands v\u03b1 it holds that \u03c8 t (v\u03b1 ) = v\u03b1 .\n\n(14)\n\n3.3. Monotonicity and braid diagrams. The monotonicity Axiom (A1) in the previous\nsubsection has a very clean interpretation in the space of braid diagrams. Recall from \u00a72\nthat any discretized braid u has an associated diagram \u03b2(u) which can be interpreted\nas a positive closed braid. Any such diagram in general position can be expressed in\nn\u22121\nterms of the (positive) generators {\u03c3j }j=1\nof the braid group Bn . While this word is not\nnecessarily unique, the length of the word is, as one can easily see from the presentation\nof Bn and the definition of Ddn . The length of a closed braid in the generators \u03c3j is thus\n5Equivalently, one could impose \u2202 R \u2265 0 and \u2202 R > 0 for all i.\n1 i\n3 i\n\n\f12\n\nR.W. GHRIST, J.B. VAN DEN BERG, AND R.C. VANDERVORST\n\nprecisely the word metric |*|word from geometric group theory. The geometric interpretation of |u|word for a braid u is clearly the number of pairwise strand crossings in the\ndiagram \u03b2(u).\nThe primary result of this section is that the word metric acts as a discrete Lyapunov\nfunction for any parabolic flow on D\u0304dn . This is really the braid-theoretic version of the\nlap number arguments that have been used in several related settings [2, 4, 5, 19, 22, 39,\n41, 53]. The result we prove below can be excavated from these cited works; however,\nwe choose to give a brief self-contained proof for completeness.\nProposition 11. Let \u03a8t be a parabolic flow on D\u0304dn .\n(a) For each point u \u2208 \u03a3 \u2212 \u03a3\u2212 , the local orbit {\u03a8t (u) : t \u2208 [\u2212\u01eb, \u01eb]} intersects \u03a3 uniquely\nat u for all \u01eb sufficiently small.\n(b) For any such u, the length of the braid diagram \u03a8t (u) for t > 0 in the word metric is\nstrictly less than that of the diagram \u03a8t (u), t < 0.\nProof. Choose a point u in \u03a3 representing a singular braid diagram. We induct on the\ncodimension m of the singularity.

A parabolic flow on a discretized braid class is transverse to\nthe boundary faces. The local linking of strands decreases strictly along\nthe flowlines at a singular braid u.\n\nso that the vector field R is tangent to \u03a3 at u but is not tangent to \u03a3[M ]: the flowline\nthrough u decreases codimension immediately. By the induction hypothesis on (b), the\nflowline through u cannot possess intersections with \u03a3[m] for m < M which accumulate\nonto u - the length of the braids are finite. Thus the flowline intersects \u03a3 locally at u\nuniquely. This concludes the proof of (a).\nIt remains to show that the length of the braid word decreases strictly at u in \u03a3[M ].\nBy (a), the flow \u03a8t is nonsingular in a neighborhood of u; thus, by the Flowbox Theorem, there is a tubular neighborhood of local \u03a8t -flowlines about \u03a8t (u). The beginning\nand ending points of these local flowlines all represent nonsingular diagrams with the\nsame word lengths as the beginning and endpoints of the path through u, since the\ncomplement of \u03a3 is an open set. Since \u03a3 is a codimension-1 algebraic semi-variety in\nD\u0304dn , it follows from transversality that most of the nearby orbits intersect \u03a3[1], at which\nbraid word length strictly decreases. This concludes the proof of (b).\nTo put this result in context with the literature, we note that the monotonicity in\n[22, 39] is one-sided: translated into our terminology, \u22023 Ri = 0 for all i. One can adapt\nthis proof to generalizations of parabolic recurrence relations appearing in the work of\nLe Calvez [36, 37]: namely, compositions of twist symplectomorphisms of the annulus\nreversing the twist-orientation.\nAs pointed out above a parabolic flow on D\u0304dn REL v is a special case of a parabolic\nflow on D\u0304dn+m with a fixed skeleton v \u2208 Ddm , and therefor the analogue of the above\nproposition for relative classes thus follows as a special case.\nRemark 12. The information that we derive from relative braid diagrams is more than\nwhat one can obtain from lap numbers alone (cf. [36]). Fig. 3 gives examples of two\nclosed discretized relative braids which have the same set of pairwise intersection numbers of strands (or lap numbers) but which force very different dynamical behaviors.\nThe homotopy invariant we define in the next section distinguishes these braids.

T HE\n\nHOMOTOPY INDEX FOR DISCRETIZED BRAIDS\n\nTechnical lemmas concerning existence of certain types of parabolic flows are required for showing the existence and well-definedness of the Conley index on braid\nclasses. We relegate these results to Appendix A.\n4.1. Review of the Conley index. We include a brief primer of the relevant ideas from\nConley's index theory for flows. For a more comprehensive treatment, we refer the\ninterested reader to [47].\nIn brief, the Conley index is an extension of the Morse index. Consider the case of a\nnondegenerate gradient flow: the Morse index of a fixed point is then the dimension of\nthe unstable manifold to the fixed point. In contrast, the Conley index is the homotopy\ntype of a certain pointed space (in this case, the sphere of dimension equal to the Morse\nindex). The Conley index can be defined for sufficiently \"isolated\" invariant sets in any\nflow, not merely for fixed points of gradients.\nRecall the notion of an isolating neighborhood as introduced by Conley [11]. Let X\nbe a locally compact metric space. A compact set N \u2282 X is an isolating neighborhood for\na flow \u03c8 t on X if the maximal invariant set I NV (N ) := {x \u2208 N | cl{\u03c8 t (x)}t\u2208R \u2282 N }\nis contained in the interior of N . The invariant set I NV (N ) is then called a compact\nisolated invariant set for \u03c8 t . In [11] it is shown that every compact isolated invariant\nset I NV(N ) admits a pair (N, N \u2212 ) such that (following the definitions given in [47])\n(i) I NV(N ) = I NV(cl(N \u2212 N \u2212 )) with N \u2212 N \u2212 a neighborhood of I NV(N ); (ii) N \u2212 is\npositively invariant in N ; and (iii) N \u2212 is an exit set for N : given x \u2208 N and t1 > 0 such\nthat \u03c8 t1 (x) 6\u2208 N , then there exists a t0 \u2208 [0, t1 ] for which {\u03c8 t (x) : t \u2208 [0, t0 ]} \u2282 N and\n\u03c8 t0 (x) \u2208 N \u2212 . Such a pair is called an index pair for I NV (N ). The Conley\u0001 index, h(N ),\nis\nas the homotopy type of the pointed space N/N \u2212 , [N \u2212 ] , abbreviated\n\u0002 then\u2212defined\n\u0003\nN/N . This homotopy class is independent of the defining index pair, making the\nConley index well-defined.\nA large body of results and applications of the Conley index theory exists. We recall\nfollowing [47] two foundational results.\n\n\fMORSE THEORY ON SPACES OF BRAIDS\n\n15\n\n(a) Stability of isolating neighborhoods: Any isolating neighborhood N for a flow\n\u03c8 t is an isolating neighborhood for all flows sufficiently C 0 -close to \u03c8 t .\n(b) Continuation of the Conley index: Let \u03c8\u03bbt , \u03bb \u2208 [0, 1] be a continuous family of\nflows with N\u03bb a family of isolating neighborhoods. Define the\n\u0001 parameterized\nflow (t, x, \u03bb) 7\u2192 (\u03c8\u03bbt (x), \u03bb) on X \u00d7 [0, 1], and N = \u222a\u03bb N\u03bb \u00d7 {\u03bb} . If N \u2282 X \u00d7 [0, 1]\nis an isolating neighborhood for the parameterized flow then the index h\u03bb =\nh(N\u03bb , \u03c8\u03bbt ) is invariant under \u03bb.\nSince the homotopy type of a space is notoriously difficult to compute, one often passes\nto homology or cohomology. One defines the Conley homology6 of I NV (N ) to be\nCH\u2217 (N ) := H\u2217 (N, N \u2212 ), where H\u2217 is singular homology. To the homological Conley index ofPan index pair (N, N \u2212 ) one can also assign the characteristic polynomial\nCPt (N ) := k\u22650 \u03b2k tk , where \u03b2k is the free rank of CHk (N ). Note that, in analogy with\nMorse homology, if CH\u2217 (N ) 6= 0, then there exists a nontrivial invariant set within the\ninterior of N . For more detailed description see \u00a77.\n4.2. Proper and bounded braid classes. From Proposition 11, one readily sees that\ncomplements of \u03a3 yield isolating neighborhoods, except for the presence of the collapsed singular braids \u03a3\u2212 , which is an invariant set in \u03a3. For the remainder of this\npaper we restrict our attention to those relative braid diagrams whose braid classes\nprohibit collapse.\nFix v \u2208 Ddm , and consider the relative braid classes {u REL v} (topological) and\n[u REL v] (discretized).\nDefinition 13. A topological relative braid class {u REL v} is proper if it is impossible to find\na continuous path of braid diagrams u(t) REL v for t \u2208 [0, 1] such that u(0) = u, u(t) REL v\ndefines a braid for all t \u2208 [0, 1), and u(1) REL v is a diagram where an entire component of the\nclosed braid has collapsed onto itself or onto another component of u or v. A discretized relative\nbraid class [u REL v] is called proper if the associated topological braid class is proper, otherwise,\nit is improper: see Fig. 4.\nDefinition 14. A topological relative braid class {u REL v} is called bounded if there exists\na uniform bound on all representatives u of the equivalence class, i.e. on the strands \u03b2(u) (in\nC 0 ([0, 1])). A discrete relative braid class [u REL v] is called bounded if the set [u REL v] is\nbounded.\nNote that if a topological class {u REL v} is bounded then the discrete class [u REL v]\nis bounded as well for any period. The converse does not always hold. Bounded braid\nclasses possess a compactness sufficient to implement the Conley index theory without further assumptions. It is not hard either to see or to prove that properness and\nboundedness are well-defined properties of equivalence classes of braids.\n4.3. Existence and invariance of the Conley index for braids.\nTheorem 15. Suppose [u REL v] is a bounded proper relative braid class and \u03a8t is a parabolic\nflow fixing v. Then the following are true:\n(a) N := cl[u REL v] is an isolating neighborhood for the flow \u03a8t , which thus yields a\nwell-defined Conley index h(u REL v) := h(N );\n6In [14] \u010cech cohomology is used.

Isolation is proved by examining \u03a8t on the boundary \u2202N . By Definition 13\nand 14 the set N is compact, and \u2202N \u2282 \u03a3\\\u03a3\u2212 . Choose a point u on \u2202N . Proposition 11\nimplies that the parabolic flow \u03a8t locally intersects \u2202N at u alone and that furthermore\nits length in the braid group strictly decreases. This implies that under \u03a8t , the point u\nexits the set N either in forwards or backwards time (if not both). Thus, u 6\u2208 I NV (N )\nand (a) is proved.\nDenote by h(u REL v) the index of I NV (N ). To demonstrate (b), consider two parabolic flows \u03a8t0 and \u03a8t1 that satisfy all our requirements, and consider the isolating\nneighborhood N valid for both flows. Construct a homotopy \u03a8t\u03bb , \u03bb \u2208 [0, 1], by considering the parabolic recurrence functions R\u03bb = (1 \u2212 \u03bb)R0 + \u03bbR1 , where R0 and R1\ngive rise to the flows \u03a8t0 and \u03a8t1 respectively. It follows immediately that \u03a8t\u03bb (v) = v,\nfor all \u03bb \u2208 [0, 1]; therefore N is an isolating neighborhood for \u03a8t\u03bb with \u03bb \u2208 [0, 1]. Define\nI NV \u03bb (N ), \u03bb \u2208 [0, 1], to be the maximal invariant set in N with respect to the flow \u03a8t\u03bb .\nThe continuation property of the Conley index completes the proof of (b).\nAssume that [u REL v] \u223c [u\u2032 REL v\u2032 ], so that there is a continuous path (u(\u03bb), v(\u03bb)),\nfor 0 \u2264 \u03bb \u2264 1, of braid pairs within Ddn+m between the two. From the proof of Lemma 57\nin Appendix A, there exists a continuous family of flows \u03a8t\u03bb , such that \u03a8t\u03bb (v(\u03bb)) = v(\u03bb),\nfor all \u03bb \u2208 [0, 1]. Item (a) ensures that N\u03bb := cl[u REL v(\u03bb)] is an isolating neighborhood\n\u0001\nfor all \u03bb \u2208 [0, 1]. The continuity of v(\u03bb) implies that the set N := \u222a\u03bb N\u03bb \u00d7 {\u03bb} \u2282\nD\u0304dn \u00d7 [0, 1] is an isolating neighborhood for the parameterized flow (\u03a8t\u03bb (u), \u03bb) on D\u0304dn \u00d7\n[0, 1]. Therefore via the continuation property of the Conley index, h(u REL v(\u03bb)) is\nindependent of \u03bb \u2208 [0, 1], which completes the proof of Item (c).\n4.4. An intrinsic definition. For any bounded proper relative braid class [u REL v] we\ncan define its index intrinsically, independent of any notions of parabolic flows. Denote\nas before by N the set cl[u REL v] within D\u0304dn . The singular braid diagrams \u03a3 partition D\u0304dn\n\n\fMORSE THEORY ON SPACES OF BRAIDS\n\n17\n\ninto disjoint cells (the discretized relative braid classes), the closures of which contain\nportions of \u03a3. For a bounded proper braid class, N is compact, and \u2202N avoids \u03a3\u2212 .\nTo define the exit set N \u2212 , consider any point w on \u2202N \u2282 \u03a3. There exists a small\nneighborhood W of w in D\u0304dn for which the subset W \u2212 \u03a3 consists of a finite number of\nconnected components {Wj }. Assume that W0 = W \u2229 N . We define N \u2212 to be the set of\nw for which the word metric is locally maximal on W0 , namely,\n\b\n(15)\nN \u2212 := cl w \u2208 \u2202N : |W0 |word \u2265 |Wj |word \u2200j > 0 .\nt\nWe deduce that (N, N \u2212 ) is an index pair for any parabolic\n\u0002 flow\n\u0003for which \u03a8 (v) = v,\nt\n\u2212\nand thus by the independence of \u03a8 , the homotopy type N/N gives the Conley index. The index can be computed by choosing a representative v \u2208 [v] and determining\nN and N \u2212 . A rigorous computer assisted approach exists for computing the homological index using cube complexes and digital homology [23].\n\n4.5. Three simple examples. It is not obvious what the homotopy index is measuring\ntopologically. Since the space N has one dimension per free anchor point, examples\nquickly become complex.\nExample 1: Consider the proper period-2 braid illustrated in Fig. 5[left]. (Note that\ndeleting any strand in the skeleton yields an improper braid.) There is exactly one free\nstrand with two anchor points (recall that these are closed braids and the left and right\nsides are identified). The anchor point in the middle, u1 , is free to move vertically between the fixed points on the skeleton. At the endpoints, one has a singular braid in \u03a3\nwhich is on the exit set since a slight perturbation sends this singular braid to a different braid class with fewer crossings. The end anchor point, u2 (= u0 ) can freely move\nvertically in between the two fixed points on the skeleton. The singular boundaries are\nin this case not on the exit set since pushing u2 across the skeleton increases the number\nof crossings.\n\nPSfrag replacements\n\nu0\n\nu2\nu1\n\n\u2282\nu1\nu2\n\n\u03a3\n\nF IGURE 5. The braid of Example 1 [left] and the associated configuration space with parabolic flow [middle]. On the right is an expanded\nview of D21 REL v where the fixed points of the flow correspond to the\nfour fixed strands in the skeleton v. The braid classes adjacent to these\nfixed points are not proper.\nSince the points u1 and u2 can be moved independently, the configuration space N in\nthis case is the product of two compact intervals.

Thus, the homotopy index of this relative braid\nis [N/N \u2212 ] \u2243 S 1 .\nExample 2: Consider the proper relative braid presented in Fig. 6[left]. Since there is\none free strand of period three, the configuration space N is determined by the vector of positions (u0 , u1 , u2 ) of the anchor points. This example differs greatly from the\nprevious example. For instance, the point u0 (as represented in the figure) may pass\nthrough the nearest strand of the skeleton above and below without changing the braid\nclass. The points u1 and u2 may not pass through any strands of the skeleton without\nchanging the braid class unless u0 has already passed through. In this case, either u1 or\nu2 (depending on whether the upper or lower strand is crossed) becomes free.\nTo simplify the analysis, consider (u0 , u1 , u2 ) as all of R3 (allowing for the moment\nsingular braids and other braid classes as well). The position of the skeleton induces a\ncubical partition of R3 by planes, the equations being ui = vi\u03b1 for the various strands\nv \u03b1 of the skeleton v. The braid class N is thus some collection of cubes in R3 . In\nFig. 6[right], we illustrate this cube complex associated to N , claiming that it is homeomorphic to D2 \u00d7 S 1 .

Take an n-fold cover of\nthe skeleton as illustrated in Fig. 7. By weaving a single free strand in and out of the\nstrands as shown, it is possible to generate numerous examples with nontrivial index. A\nmoment's meditation suffices to show that the configuration space N for this lifted braid\nis a product of 2n intervals, the exit set being completely determined by the number\nof times the free strand is \"threaded\" through the inner loops of the skeletal braid as\nshown.\nFor an n-fold cover with one free strand we can select a family of 3n possible braid\nclasses describes as follows: the even anchor points of the free strand are always in the\nmiddle, while for the odd anchor points there are three possible choices. Two of these\nbraid classes are not proper. All of the remaining 3n \u2212 2 braid classes are bounded and\nhave homotopy indices equal to a sphere S k for some 0 \u2264 k \u2264 n.

The lifted skeleton of Example 1 with one free strand.\nStronger results follow from projecting these covers back down to the period two\nsetting of Example 1. If the free strand in the cover is chosen not to be isotopic to a\nperiodic braid, then it can be shown via a simple argument that some projection of\nthe free strand down to the period two case has nontrivial homotopy index. Thus, the\nsimple period two skeleton of Example 1 is the seed for an infinite number of braid\nclasses with nontrivial homotopy indices. Using the techniques of [32], one can use this\nfact to show that any parabolic recurrence relation (R = 0) admitting this skeleton is\nforced to have positive topological entropy: cf. the related results from the NielsenThurston theory of disc homeomorphisms [9].\n5. S TABILIZATION AND\n\nINVARIANCE\n\n5.1. Free braid classes and the extension operator. Via the results of the previous section, the homotopy index is an invariant of the discretized braid class: keeping the period\nfixed and moving within a connected component of the space of relative discretized\nbraids leaves the index invariant. The topological braid class, as defined in \u00a72, does not\nhave an implicit notion of period. The effect of refining the discretization of a topological closed braid is not obvious: not only does the dimension of the index pair change,\nthe homotopy types of the isolating neighborhood and the exit set may change as well\nupon changing the discretization. It is thus perhaps remarkable that any changes are\ncorrelated under the quotient operation: the homotopy index is an invariant of the topological closed braid class.\nOn the other hand, given a complicated braid, it is intuitively obvious that a certain\nnumber of discretization points are necessary to capture the topology correctly. If the\nperiod d is too small Ddn REL v may contain more than one path component with the\nsame topological braid class:\nDefinition 17.

There are exceptional cases in which Eu is a singular\nbraid when u is not: see Fig. 9(b). If the intersections at i = d are generic then Eu is a\nnonsingular braid. One can always find such a representative in [u], again denoted by\nu. Therefore the notation [Eu] means that u is chosen in [u] with generic intersection at\ni = d.

We will denote this set of E-singular braids\nby \u03a3E := \u2202Bd+1 \u2229 Bd : see Fig. 10.\nBy performing an appropriate change of coordinates (cf.

By construction cl(Bd ) = cl(Bd+1 ) \u2229 M, as illustrated in Fig. 10 (in the\nsimple case where all braid classes are free and Bd+1 is thus connected).\nThe remainder of the analysis is a technique in singular perturbation theory following [12]: one relates the \u03c4 -dynamics of Equation (23) to those of the t-dynamics\non M, whose orbits are of the form (x(t), 0), where x(t) satisfies the limiting equation\ndx/dt = X(x, 0).

The period-d discretized braid class [u] is free when d > |u|word .\n\n\u03c3i+1\n\n\fMORSE THEORY ON SPACES OF BRAIDS\n\n27\n\nProof. We must show that any braid u\u2032 \u2208 Ddn which has the same topological type as\nu is discretely isotopic to u. Place both u and u\u2032 in general position so as to record the\nsequences of crossings using the generators of the n-strand positive braid semigroup,\n{\u03c3i }, as in \u00a72. Recall the braid group has relations \u03c3i \u03c3j = \u03c3j \u03c3i for |i \u2212 j| > 1 and\n\u03c3i \u03c3i+1 \u03c3i = \u03c3i+1 \u03c3i \u03c3i+1 ; closure requires making conjugacy classes equivalent.\nThe conjugacy relation can be realized by a discrete isotopy as follows: since d >\n|u|word , u must possess some discretization interval on which there are no crossings.\nLemma 25 then implies that this interval without crossings commutes with all neighboring discretization intervals via discrete isotopies. Performing d consecutive exchanges\nshifts the entire braid over by one discretization interval. This generates the conjugacy\nrelation.\nTo realize the remaining braid relations in a discrete isotopy, assume first that u and\nu\u2032 are of the form that there is at most one crossing per discretization interval. It is then\neasy to see from Fig. 12 that the braid relations can be executed via discrete isotopy.\nIn the case where u (and/or u\u2032 ) exhibits multiple crossings on some discretization\nintervals, it must be the case that a corresponding number of other discretization intervals do not possess any crossings (since d > |u|word ). Again, by inductively utilizing\nLemma 25, we may redistribute the intervals-without-crossing and \"comb\" out the multiple crossings via discrete isotopies so as to have at most one crossing per discretization\ninterval.\n\b\n\b\nProof of Theorem 19: Assume that u REL {v} = u\u2032 REL {v\u2032 } . This implies that\nthere is a path of topological braid diagrams taking the pair (u, v) to (u\u2032 , v\u2032 ). This\npath may be chosen so as to follow a sequence of standard relations for closed braids.\nFrom the proof of Proposition 27, these relations may be performed by a discretized\nisotopy to connect the pair (Ej u, Ej v) to (Ek u\u2032 , Ek v\u2032 ) for j and k sufficiently large, and\nof\n\u0002 jthe right jrelative\n\u0003 \u0002 size to make the\n\u0003 periods of both pairs equal. For this choice, then,\nE u REL [E v] = Ek u\u2032 REL [Ek v\u2032 ] , and their homotopy indices agree. An application\nof Theorem 20 completes the proof.\nWe suspect that all braids in the image of E are free: a result which, if true, would\nsimplify index computations yet further.\n6. D UALITY\nFor purposes of computation of the index, we will often pass to the homological\nlevel. In this setting, there is a natural duality made possible by the fact that the index\npair used to compute the index of a braid class can be chosen to be a manifold pair.\nn\nn\nDefinition 28.

The topological action of D is to insert a half-twist at each spatial segment\nof the braid. This has the effect of linking unlinked strands, and, since D is an involution,\nlinked strands are unlinked by D: see Fig. 13.\n\n\f28\n\nR.W. GHRIST, J.B. VAN DEN BERG, AND R.C.

The topological action of D.\nFor the duality statements to follow, we assume that all braids considered have even\nperiods and that all of the braid classes and their duals are proper, so that the homotopy\nindex is well-defined.\nLemma 29. The duality map D respects braid classes: if [u] = [u\u2032 ] then [D(u)] = [D(u\u2032 )].\nBounded braid classes are taken to bounded braid classes by D.\nn\nProof: It suffices to show that the map D is a homeomorphism on the pair (D\u03042p\n, \u03a3).\n\u2032\nn\nThis is true on D\u03042p\nsince D is a smooth involution (D\u22121 = D).

Boundedness is clearly preserved.\n\nTheorem 30.\n(a) The effect of D on the index pair is to reverse the direction of the parabolic\nflow.\nn\n(b) For [u REL v] \u2282 D2p\nREL v of period 2p with n free strands,\n(33)\nCH\u2217 (h(D(u REL v)); R) \u223c\n= CH2np\u2212\u2217 (h(u REL v); R).\n(34)\n\nn\n(c) For [u REL v] \u2282 D2p\n\nv of period 2p with n free strands,\nCH\u2217 (H(D(u REL v)); R) \u223c\n= CH2np\u2212\u2217 (H(u REL v); R).\nREL\n\nProof: For (a), let (N, N \u2212 ) denote an index pair associated to a proper relative braid\nclass [u REL v]. Dualizing sends N to a homeomorphic space D(N ). The following local\nargument shows that the exit set of the dual braid class is in fact the complement (in the\nboundary) of the exit set of the domain braid: specifically,\n\b\n(D(N ))\u2212 = cl \u2202(D(N )) \u2212 D(N \u2212 ) .\n\u2032\n\nLet w \u2208 [u REL v] \u2229 \u03a3. At any singular anchor point of w, i.e., where wi\u03b1 = wi\u03b1 and\nthe transversality condition is not satisfied, then it follows from Axiom (A2) that\n\u001b\n\u001a\nn\no\n\u2032\nd \u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\u2032\n(wi \u2212 wi\u03b1 ) = SIGN wi\u22121\n\u2212 wi\u22121\n.\n(35)\nSIGN\ndt\n\u2032\n\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n(Depending on the form of (A2) employed, one might use wi+1\n\u2212 wi+1\non the right hand\nside without loss.) Since the subscripts on the left side have the opposite parity of the\nsubscripts on the right side, taking the dual braid (which multiplies the anchor points\n\n\fMORSE THEORY ON SPACES OF BRAIDS\n\n29\n\nby (\u22121)i and (\u22121)i\u22121 respectively) alters the sign of the terms. Thus, the operator D\nreverses the direction of the parabolic flow.\nFrom this, we may compute the Conley index of the dual braid by reversing the timeorientation of the flow. Since one can choose the index pair used to compute the index\nto be an oriented manifold pair (specifically, an isolating block: see, e.g., [60]), one may\nthen apply a Poincar\u00e9-Lefschetz duality argument as in [44] and use the fact that the\ndimension is 2np to obtain the duality formula for homology. This yields (b).\nThe final claim (c) follows from (b) by showing that D is bijective on topological braid\nn\nclasses within D\u03042p\n. Assume that [u REL v] and [u\u2032 REL v] are distinct braid classes in\nn\nn\nD2p of the same topological type. Since D is a homeomorphism on D2p\n, the dual classes\n\u2032\n[Du REL Dv] and [Du REL Dv] are distinct. Claim (c) follows upon showing that these\nduals are still topologically the same braid class.\nProposition 27 implies that [(E2k u) REL (E2k v)] = [(E2k u\u2032 ) REL (E2k v)] for k sufficiently large since {u REL v} = {u\u2032 REL v}. By Lemma 29,\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0003\nD (E2k u) REL (E2k v) = D (E2k u\u2032 ) REL (E2k v) ,\nwhich, by Lemma 7 means that these braids are topologically the same. The topological\naction of dualizing the 2k-stabilizations of u REL v and u\u2032 REL v is to add k full twists.\nSince the full twist is in the center of the braid group (this element commutes with\nall other elements of the braid group [8]), one can factor the dual braids within the\ntopological braid group and mod out by k full twists, yielding that {Du REL Dv} =\n{Du\u2032 REL Dv}.\nWe use this homological duality to complete a crucial computation in the proof of\nthe forcing theorems (e.g., Theorem 1) at the end of this paper. The following small\ncorollary uses duality to give the first step towards answering the question of just what\nthe homotopy index measures topologically about a braid class. Recall the definition of\nan augmented braid from Remark 24.\nCorollary 31. Consider the dual of any augmented proper relative braid. Adding a full twist to\nthis dual braid shifts the homology of the index up by two dimensions.\nProof: Assume that D[u REL v\u2217 ] is the dual of an augmented braid in period 2p (the\naugmentation is required to keep the braid class bounded upon adding a full twist).\nThe prior augmentation implies that the outer two strands of Dv \"maximally link\" the\nremainder of the relative braid. The effect of adding a full twist to this braid can be\nrealized by instead stabilizing [u REL v\u2217 ] twice and then dualizing. The homological\nduality implies that for each connected component of the topological class,\n(36)\n\nCH\u2217 (h(DE2 (u REL v\u2217 )))\n\n\u223c\n=\n\u223c\n=\n\u223c\n=\n\nCH2np+2\u2212\u2217 (h(E2 (u REL v\u2217 )))\nCH2np+2\u2212\u2217 (h(u REL v\u2217 ))\nCH\u2217\u22122 (h(D(u REL v\u2217 ))),\n\nwhich gives the desired result for the index H via Theorem 30.\nRemark 32. The homotopy version of (36) can be achieved by following a similar procedure as in \u00a75. One obtains a double-suspension of the homotopy index, as opposed to\na shift in homology.\n\n\f30\n\nR.W. GHRIST, J.B. VAN DEN BERG, AND R.C. VANDERVORST\n\nRemark 33. Given a braid class [u] of odd period p = 2d + 1, the image under D is not\nnecessarily a discretized braid at all: without some symmetry condition, the braid will\nnot \"close up\" at the ends. To circumvent this, define the dual of u to be the braid D(u2 )\n- the dual of the period 2p extension of u. The analogue of Theorem 30 above is that\n(37)\n\nCH\u2217 (H(SYM (D(u RELv))); R) \u223c\n= CHnp\u2212\u2217 (H(u REL v); R),\n\nwhere SYM denotes the subset of the braid class which consists of symmetric braids:\n\u03b1\nu\u03b1\ni = u2p\u2212i for all i.\n7. M ORSE\n\nTHEORY\n\nIt is clear that the Morse-theoretic content of the homotopy index on braids holds\nimplications for the dynamics of parabolic flows and thus zeros of parabolic recurrence\nrelations. With this in mind, we restrict ourselves to bounded proper braid classes.\nRecall that the characteristic polynomial of an index pair (N, N \u2212 ) is the polynomial\nX\n(38)\nCPt (N ) :=\n\u03b2 k tk ;\n\u03b2k (N ) := dim CHk (N ; R) = dim Hk (N, N \u2212 ; R).\nk\u22650\n\nThe Morse relations in the setting of the Conley index (see [14]) state that, if N has a\nMorse decomposition into distinct isolating subsets {Na }C\na=1 , then\n(39)\n\nC\nX\n\nCPt (Na ) = CPt (N ) + (1 + t)Qt ,\n\na=1\n\nfor some polynomial Qt with nonnegative integer coefficients.\n7.1. The exact, nondegenerate case. For parabolic recurrence relations which satisfy\n(A3) (gradient type) it holds that if h(u REL v) 6= 0, then R has at least one fixed point\nin [u REL v]. Indeed, one has:\nLemma 34. For an exact nondegenerate parabolic flow on a bounded proper relative braid class,\nthe sum of the Betti numbers \u03b2k of h, as defined in (38), is a lower bound on the number of fixed\npoints of the flow on that braid class.\nProof: The details of this standard Morse theory argument are provided for the sake\nof completeness. Choose \u03a8t a nondegenerate gradient parabolic flow on [u REL v] (in\nparticular, \u03a8t fixes v for all time). Enumerate the [finite number of] fixed points {ua }C\na=1\nof \u03a8t on this [bounded] braid class. By nondegeneracy, the fixed point set may be taken\nto be a Morse decomposition of I NV (N ). The characteristic polynomial of each fixed\n\u2217\npoint is merely t\u03bc (ua ) , where \u03bc\u2217 (ua ) is the Morse co-index of ua . Substituting t = 1\ninto Equation (39) yields the lower bound\nX\n(40)\n#Fix([u REL v], \u03a8t ) \u2265\n\u03b2k (h).\nk\n\nOn the level of the topological braid invariant H, one needs to sum over all the path\ncomponents as follows. As in Theorem 19, choose period-d\brepresentatives u(j) (j from\n0 to m) for each path component of the topological class u REL {v} . If we consider\n\n\fMORSE THEORY ON SPACES OF BRAIDS\n\nfixed points in the union \u222am\nj=0 [u(j)\nfrom (40) and Theorem 19:\n(41)\n\nREL\n\n31\n\nv], we obtain the following Morse inequalities\n\nt\n#Fix(\u222am\nj=0 [u(j) REL v], \u03a8 ) \u2265\n\nX\n\n\u03b2k (H),\n\nk\n\nwhere \u03b2k (H) is the k th Betti number of H(u REL v\u2217 ). Thus, again, the sum of the Betti\nnumbers is a lower bound, with the proviso that some components may not contain any\ncritical points.\n\b\nIf the topological class u REL {v} is bounded the inequality (41) holds with the\ninvariant H(u REL v).\n7.2. The exact, degenerate case. Here a coarse lower bound still exists.\nLemma 35. For an arbitrary exact parabolic flow on a bounded relative braid class, the number\nof fixed points is bounded below by the number of distinct nonzero monomials in the characteristic polynomial CPt (h).\nProof: Assuming that #Fix is finite, all critical points are isolated and form a Morse\ndecomposition of I NV(N ). The specific nature of parabolic recurrence relations reveals\nthat the dimension of the null space of the linearized matrix at an isolated critical point\nis at most 2, see e.g. [56]. Using this fact Dancer proves [15], via the degenerate version\nof the Morse lemma due to Gromoll and Meyer, that CHk (ua ) 6= 0 for at most one index\nk = k0 . Equation (39) implies that,\n(42)\n\nCd\nX\n\na=1\n\nCPt (ua ) \u2265 CPt (h)\n\non the level of polynomials. As the result of Dancer implies that for each a, CPt (ua ) =\nAtk , for some A \u2265 0, it follows that the number of critical points needs to be at least the\nnumber of non-trivial monomials in CPt (h).\n\b\nAs before, if we instead use the topological invariant H for u REL {v\u2217 } we obtain\nthat the number of monomials in CPt (H) is a lower bound for the total sum of fixed\npoints over the topologically equivalent path-components.\nMore elaborate estimates in some cases can be obtained via the extension of the Conley index due to Floer [17].\n7.3. The non-exact case. If we consider parabolic recurrence relations that are not necessarily exact, the homotopy index may still provide information about solutions of\nR = 0. This is more delicate because of the possibility of periodic solutions for the flow\nu\u2032i = Ri (ui\u22121 , ui , ui+1 ). For example, if CPt (h) mod (1 + t) = 0, the index does not\nprovide information about additional solutions for R = 0, as a simple counterexample\nshows. However, if CPt (h) mod (1 + t) 6= 0, then there exists at least one solution of\nR = 0 with the specified relative braid class. Specifically,\nLemma 36. An arbitrary parabolic flow on a bounded relative braid class is forced to have a\nfixed point if \u03c7(h) := CP\u22121 (h) is nonzero.

S ECOND ORDER L AGRANGIAN SYSTEMS\nIn this final third of the paper, we apply the developed machinery to the problem of forcing closed characteristics in second order Lagrangian systems of twist type.\nThe vast literature on fourth order differential equations coming from second order\nLagrangians includes many physical models in nonlinear elasticity, nonlinear optics,\nphysics of solids, Ginzburg-Landau equations, etc. (see \u00a71). In this context we mention\nthe work of [1, 38, 49, 50].\n8.1. Twist systems. We recall from \u00a71 that closed characteristics at an energy level E\nare concatenations of monotone laps between minima and maxima (ui )i\u2208Z , which are\nperiodic sequences with even period 2p. The extrema are restricted to the set UE , whose\nconnected components are denoted by IE : interval components (see \u00a71.2 for the precise\ndefinition). The problem of finding closed characteristics can, in most cases, be formulated as a finite dimensional variational problem on the extrema (ui ). The following\ntwist hypothesis, introduced in [58], is key:\nR\u03c4\n\u0001\n(T): inf{JE [u] = 0 L(u, ux , uxx ) + E dx | u \u2208 X\u03c4 (u1 , u2 ), \u03c4 \u2208 R+ } has a minimizer\nu(x; u1 , u2 ) for all (u1 , u2 ) \u2208 {IE \u00d7 IE | u1 6= u2 }, and u and \u03c4 are C 1 -smooth\nfunctions of (u1 , u2 ).\n11We choose to define the degree via \u2212dR\ne in order to simplify the formulae.\n\n\fMORSE THEORY ON SPACES OF BRAIDS\n\n33\n\nHere X\u03c4 = X\u03c4 (u1 , u2 ) = {u \u2208 C 2 ([0, \u03c4 ]) | u(0) = u1 , u(\u03c4 ) = u2 , ux (0) = ux (\u03c4 ) =\n0 and ux |(0,\u03c4 ) > 0}.\nHypothesis (T) is a weaker version of the hypothesis that assumes that the monotone\nlaps between extrema are unique (see, e.g., [34, 35, 58]). Hypothesis (T) is valid for large\nclasses of Lagrangians L. For example, if L(u, v, w) = 12 w2 + K(u, v), the following two\ninequalities ensure the validity of (T):\n(a)\n(b)\n\n\u2202K\n\u2202v v \u2212 K(u,\bv) \u2212 E \u2264 0, and\n\u22022K\n5 \u2202K\n2\n\u2202v 2 |v| \u2212 2 \u2202v v \u2212 K(u, v) \u2212\n\nE \u2265 0 for all u \u2208 IE and v \u2208 R.\n\nMany physical models, such as the Swift-Hohenberg equation (3), meet these requirements, although these conditions are not always met. In those cases numerical calculations still predict the validity of (T), which leaves the impression that the results obtained for twist systems carry over to many more systems for which Hypothesis (T) is\nhard to check.12 For these reasons twist systems play a important role in understanding\nsecond order Lagrangian systems. For a direct application of this see [31].\nThe existence of minimizing laps is valid under very mild hypotheses on K (see\n[31]). In that case (b) above is enough to guarantee the validity of (T). An example of a\nLagrangian that satisfies (T), but not (a) is given by the Erickson beam-model [30, 49, 55]\nL(u, ux , uxx ) = \u03b12 |uxx |2 + 41 (|ux |2 \u2212 1)2 + \u03b22 u2 .\n8.2. Discretization of the variational principle. We commence by repeating the underlying variational principle for obtaining closed characteristics as described in [58]. In the\npresent context a broken geodesic is a C 2 -concatenation of monotone laps (alternating between increasing and decreasing laps) given by Hypothesis (T). A closed characteristic\nu at energy level E is a (C 2 -smooth) function u : [0, \u03c4 ] \u2192 R, 0 < \u03c4 < \u221e, which is\n2\nstationary for the action JE [u] with respect to variations \u03b4u \u2208 Cper\n(0, \u03c4 ), and \u03b4\u03c4 \u2208 R+ ,\nand as such is a 'smooth broken geodesic'.\nThe following result, a translation of results implicit in [58], is the motivation and\nbasis for the applications of the machinery in the first two-thirds of this paper.\nTheorem 37. Extremal points {ui } for bounded solutions of second order Lagrangian twist\nsystems are solutions of an exact parabolic recurrence relation with the constraints that (i)\n(\u22121)i ui < (\u22121)i ui+1 ; and (ii) the recurrence relation blows up along any sequence satisfying ui = ui+1 .\nProof: For simplicity, we restrict to the case of a nonsingular energy level E: for singular energy levels, a slightly more involved argument is required.

GHRIST, J.B. VAN DEN BERG, AND R.C. VANDERVORST\n\n8.3.2. Universality for up-down braids. We now show that the topological information\ncontained in up-down braid classes can be continued to the canonical case described\nin \u00a72. As always, we restrict attention to proper, bounded braid classes, proper being\ndefined as in Definition 13, and bounded meaning that the set [u REL v]E is bounded\nn\nin D\u03042p\n. Note that an up-down braid class [u REL v]E can sometimes be bounded while\n[u REL v] is not. To bounded proper up-down braids we assign a homotopy index.\nFrom Lemma 40 it follows that for \u01eb sufficiently small the set NE,\u01eb := cl\u0112,\u01eb [u REL v]E is\nn\nan isolating neighborhood in \u01122p\nwhose Conley index,\nh(u REL v, E) := h(NE,\u01eb ),\nis well-defined with respect to any parabolic flow \u03a8t generated by a parabolic recurrence relation of up-down type, and is independent of \u01eb. As before, non-triviality of\nh(NE,\u01eb ) implies existence of a non-trivial invariant set inside NE,\u01eb (see \u00a78.3.3).\nThe obvious question is what relationship holds between the homotopy index\nh(u REL v, E) and that of a braid class without the up-down restriction. To answer\nthis, augment the skeleton v as follows: define v\u2217 = v \u222a v\u2212 \u222a v+ , where\nvi\u2212 := min vi\u03b1 \u2212 1 + (\u22121)i+1 ,\n\u03b1,i\n\nvi+ := max vi\u03b1 + 1 + (\u22121)i+1 .\n\u03b1,i\n\nThe topological braid class {u REL v\u2217 } is bounded and proper. Indeed, boundedness\n\u03b1\nfollows from adding the strands v\u00b1 which bound u, since min\u03b1,i vi\u03b1 \u2264 u\u03b1\ni \u2264 max\u03b1,i vi .\nProperness is satisfied since {u REL v} is proper.\nn\nTheorem 41. For any bounded proper up-down braid class [u REL v]E in E2p\n\nREL\n\nv,\n\nh(u REL v, E) = h(u REL v\u2217 ).\nProof. From Lemma 55 in Appendix A we obtain a parabolic recurrence relation R0\n(not necessarily up-down type) for which v\u2217 is a solution. We denote the associated\nparabolic flow by \u03a8t0 . Define two functions k1 and k2 in C 1 (R), with k1\u2032 \u2265 0 \u2265 k2\u2032 , and\nk1 (\u03c4 ) = 0 for \u03c4 \u2264 \u22122\u03b4, k1 (\u2212\u03b4) \u2265 K, and k2 (\u03c4 ) = 0 for \u03c4 \u2265 2\u03b4, k2 (\u03b4) \u2265 K, for some\n\u03b4 > 0 and K > 0 to be specified later. Introduce a new recurrence function R1i (r, s, t) =\nR0i (r, s, t)+k2 (s\u2212r)+k1 (t\u2212s) for i odd, and R1i (r, s, t) = R0i (r, s, t)\u2212k1 (s\u2212r)\u2212k2 (t\u2212s)\nfor i even. The associated parabolic flow will be denoted by \u03a8t1 , and \u03a8t1 (v\u2217 ) = v\u2217\nby construction by choosing \u03b4 sufficiently small. Indeed, if we choose \u03b4 < \u01eb(v), the\naugmented skeleton is a fixed point for \u03a8t1 .\nSince the braid class [u REL v\u2217 ] is bounded and proper, N1 = cl[u REL v\u2217 ] is an\nisolating neighborhood with invariant set I NV(N1 ). If we choose K large enough, and\n\u03b4 sufficiently small, then the invariant set I NV(N1 ) lies entirely in cl\u0112,\u01eb [u REL v\u2217 ]E =\ncl\u0112,\u01eb [u REL v]E = NE,\u01eb . Indeed, for large K we have that for each i, R1i (r, s, t) has a\nfixed sign on the complement of NE,\u01eb . Therefore, h(u REL v\u2217 ) = h(N1 ) = h(NE,\u01eb ). Now\nn\nREL v. We may now construct a homotopy between\nrestrict the flow \u03a8t1 to NE,\u01eb \u2282 E \u03042p\nt\nt\n1\n\u03a81 and \u03a8 , via (1 \u2212 \u03bb)R + \u03bbR (see Appendix A), where R and the associated flow \u03a8t\nare defined by (45). The braid v\u2217 is stationary along the homotopy and therefore\nh(N1 ) = h(NE,\u01eb , \u03a8t1 ) = h(NE,\u01eb , \u03a8t ),\nwhich proves the theorem.\n\n\fMORSE THEORY ON SPACES OF BRAIDS\n\n37\n\nWe point out that similar results can be proved for other domains \u03a9i with various\nboundary conditions. The key observation is that the up-down constraint is really just\nan addition to the braid skeleton.\n8.3.3. Morse theory. For bounded proper up-down braid classes [u REL v]E the Morse\ntheory of \u00a77 applies. Combining this with Lemma 40 and Theorem 41,\n\b the topological\ninformation is given by the invariant H of the topological braid type u REL {v\u2217 } .\n\nCorollary 42. On bounded proper up-down braid classes, the total number of fixed points of an\nexact parabolic up-down recurrence relation is bounded below by the number of monomials in\nthe critical polynomial CPt (H) of the homotopy index.\nProof. Since all critical point are contained in NE,\u01eb the corollary follows from the\nLemmas 35, 40 and Theorem 41.\n9. M ULTIPLICITY OF\n\nCLOSED CHARACTERISTICS\n\nWe now have assembled the tools necessary to prove Theorem 1, the general forcing theorem for closed characteristics in terms of braids, and Theorems 2 and 3, the\napplication to singular and near-singular energy levels. Given one or more closed characteristics, we keep track of the braiding of the associated strands, including at will any\nperiod-two shifts. Fixing these strands as a skeleton, we add hypothetical free strands\nand compute the homotopy index. If nonzero, this index then forces the existence of\nthe free strand as an existing solution, which, when added to the skeleton, allows one\nto iterate the argument with the goal of producing an infinite family of forced closed\ncharacteristics.\nThe following lemma (whose proof is straightforward and thus omitted) will be used\nrepeatedly for proving existence of closed characteristics.\nLemma 43. Assume that R is a parabolic recurrence relation on Ddn with u a solution. Then,\nn\nfor each integer N > 1, there exists a lifted parabolic recurrence relation on DN\nd for which every\nn\nlift of u is a solution. Furthermore, any solution to the lifted dynamics on DN d projects to some\nperiod-d solution. 15\nThe primary difficulties in the proof of the forcing theorems are (i) computing the\nindex (we will use all features of the machinery developed thus far, including stabilization and duality); and (ii) asymptotics/boundary conditions related to the three types\nof closed interval components IE : a compact interval, the entire real line, and the semiinfinite ray.\nAll of the forcing theorems are couched in a little braid-theoretic language:\n\u2032\n\nDefinition 44. The intersection number of two strands u\u03b1 , u\u03b1 of a braid u is the number of\ncrossings in the braid diagram, denoted\n\u2032\n\n\u03b9(u\u03b1 , u\u03b1 ) := # of crossings of strands\nThe trivial braid on n strands is any braid (topological or discrete) whose braid diagram has no\n\u2032\ncrossings whatsoever, i.e., \u03b9(u\u03b1 , u\u03b1 ) = 0, for all \u03b1, \u03b1\u2032 . The full-twist braid on n strands, is\n15This does not imply a d-periodic solution, but merely a braid diagram u of period d.\n\n\f38\n\nR.W. GHRIST, J.B. VAN DEN BERG, AND R.C. VANDERVORST\n\nthe braid of n connected components, each of which has exactly two crossings with every other\n\u2032\nstrand, i.e., \u03b9(u\u03b1 , u\u03b1 ) = 2 for all \u03b1 6= \u03b1\u2032 .\nAmong discrete braids of period two, the trivial braid and the full twist are duals in\nthe sense of \u00a76.\n9.1. Compact interval components. Let E be a regular energy level for which the set\nUE contains a compact interval component IE .\nTheorem 45. Suppose that a twist system with compact IE possesses one or more closed characteristics which, as a discrete braid diagram, form a nontrivial braid. Then there exists an infinity\nof non-simple, geometrically distinct closed characteristics in IE .\nIn preparation for the proof of Theorem 45 we state a technical lemma, whose [short]\nproof may be found in [58].\nLemma 46. Let IE = [u\u2212 , u+ ], then there exists a \u03b40 > 0 such that\n(1) R1 (u\u2212 + \u03b4, u\u2212 , u\u2212 + \u03b4) > 0, R1 (u+ , u+ \u2212 \u03b4, u+ ) < 0, and\n(2) R2 (u\u2212 , u\u2212 + \u03b4, u\u2212 ) > 0, R2 (u+ \u2212 \u03b4, u+ , u+ \u2212 \u03b4) < 0,\nfor any 0 < \u03b4 \u2264 \u03b40 .\nProof of Theorem 45. Via Theorem 37, finding closed characteristics is equivalent to\nsolving the recurrence relation given by (45). Define the domains\n\u001a\n3\n{(ui\u22121 , ui , ui+1 ) \u2208 IE\n| u\u2212 + \u03b4 < ui\u00b11 < ui \u2212 \u03b4/2 < u+ \u2212 \u03b4}, i odd,\n\u03b4\n\u03a9i =\n3\n{(ui\u22121 , ui , ui+1 ) \u2208 IE | u\u2212 + \u03b4 < ui + \u03b4/2 < ui\u00b11 < u+ \u2212 \u03b4}, i even,\n\nFor any integer p \u2265 1 denote by \u03a92p the set of 2p-periodic sequences {ui } for which\n(ui\u22121 , ui , ui+1 ) \u2208 \u03a9\u03b4i . By Lemma 46, choosing 0 < \u03b4 < \u03b40 small enough forces the vector\nfield R = (Ri ) to be everywhere transverse to \u2202\u03a92p , making \u03a92p positively invariant for\nthe induced parabolic flow \u03a8t .\nBy Lemma 43, one can lift the assumed solution(s) to a pair of period 2p singlestranded solutions to (45), v1 and v2 , satisfying \u03b9(v1 , v2 ) 6= 0, for some p \u2265 1. Define\nthe cones\nC\u2212\n\nC+\n\n= {u \u2208 \u03a92p | ui \u2264 vi\u03b1 , \u03b1 = 1, 2}, and\n\n= {u \u2208 \u03a92p | ui \u2265 vi\u03b1 , \u03b1 = 1, 2}.\n\nThe combination of the facts \u03b9(v1 , v2 ) = r > 0, Axiom (A1), and the behavior of R\non \u2202\u03a92p implies that on the boundaries of the cones C\u2212 and C+ the vector field R is\neverywhere transverse and pointing inward. Therefore, C\u2212 and C+ are also positively\ninvariant with respect to the parabolic flow \u03a8t . Consequently, W2p has global maxima v\u2212 and v+ on int(C\u2212 ) and int(C+ ) respectively. The maxima v\u2212 and v+ have the\nproperty that vi\u2212 < vi\u03b1 < vi+ , \u03b1 = 1, 2. As a braid diagram, v = {v1 , v2 , v\u2212 , v+ } is a\nstationary skeleton for the induced parabolic flow \u03a8t .\nHaving found the solutions v\u2212 and v+ we now choose a compact interval I\nIE ,\nsuch that the skeletal strands are all contained in I. In this way we obtain a proper parabolic flow (circumventing boundary singularities) which can be extended to a parabolic\n1\nflow on \u01122p\nREL v. Let [u REL v]E be the relative braid class with a period 2p free strand\nu = {ui } which links the strands v1 and v2 with intersection number 2q while satisfying\nvi\u2212 < ui < vi+ : see Fig. 14 below.\n\n\fMORSE THEORY ON SPACES OF BRAIDS\n\n39\n\nv+\nPSfrag replacements\n\nv1\n\nv2\nu\n\nv\u2212\n\nF IGURE 14. A representative braid class for the compact case: q =\n1, r = 4, 2p = 6.\nAs an up-down braid class, [u REL v]E is a bounded proper braid class provided\n0 < 2q < r \u2264 2p, and the Morse theory discussed in \b\u00a77 and \u00a78.3.3 then requires\nthe evaluation of the invariant H of the topological class u REL {v\u2217 } . In this case,\nsince h(u REL v, E) = h(u REL v\u2217 ) = h(u REL v), augmentation is not needed, and\nH(u REL v\u2217 ) = H(u REL v). The nontriviality of the homotopy index H is given by the\nfollowing lemma, whose proof we delay until \u00a710.\nLemma 47. The Conley homology of H(u REL v) is given by:\n\u001a\nR : k = 2q \u2212 1, 2q\n(48)\nCHk (H) =\n0 : else.\n\nIn particular CPt (H) = t2q\u22121 (1 + t).\n\nFrom the Morse theory of Corollary 42 we derive that for each q satisfying 0 < 2q <\nr \u2264 2p there exist at least two distinct period-2p solutions of (45), which generically are\nof index 2q and 2q \u2212 1. In this manner, the number of solutions depends on r and p.\nTo construct infinitely many, we consider m-fold coverings of the skeleton v, i.e., one\n4\nperiodically extends v to a skeleton contained in E2pm\n, m \u2265 1. Now q must satisfy\n0 < 2q < rm \u2264 2pm. By choosing triples (q, p, m) such that (q, pm) are relative prime,\nwe obtain the same Conley homology as above, and therefore an infinity of pairs of\ngeometrically distinct solutions of (45), which, via Lemma 43 and Theorem 37 yield an\ninfinity of closed characteristics.\nNote that if we set qm = q and pm = pm, then the admissible ratios\nclosed characteristics are determined by the relation\nr\nqm\n<\n(49)\n.\n0<\npm\n2p\n\nqm\npm\n\nfor finding\n\nThus if v1 and v2 are maximally linked, i.e. r = 2p, then closed characteristics exist for\nall ratios in Q \u2229 (0, 1).\n9.2.

Furthermore define the set\nC := {u \u2208 \u03a92p | \u03b9(u, v1 ) = \u03b9(u, v2 ) = 2p}.\n\nSince 0 \u2264 \u03b9(v1 , v2 ) < 2p, the vector field R given by (45) is transverse to \u2202C. Moreover,\nthe set C is contractible, compact, and R is pointing outward at the boundary \u2202C. The\nset C is therefore negatively invariant for the induced parabolic flow \u03a8t .

We will give an outline of the proof since the arguments are more-or-less the\nsame as in the proofs of Theorems 45 and 49. Assume without loss of generality that\nIE = [\u016b, \u221e).

Lagrangians for which the above mentioned dissipativity conditions are satisfied for all (non-compact) interval components at energy E, are called\ndissipative at E.16 For such Lagrangians the results for the three different types of interval components are summarized in Theorem 1 in \u00a71. The fact that the presence of a\nnon-simple closed characteristic, when represented as a braid, yields a non-trivial, nonmaximally linked braid diagram, allows us to apply all three Theorems 45, 49, and 52,\nproving Theorem 1.\n9.4.2. Singular energy levels. The forcing theorems in \u00a79.1 - \u00a79.3 are applicable for all\nregular energy levels provided the correct configuration of closed characteristics can be\nfound a priori. In this section we will discuss the role of singular energy levels; they\nmay create configurations which force the existence of (infinitely) many periodic orbits.\nThe equilibrium points in these singular energy levels act as seeds for the infinite family\nof closed characteristics.\nFor singular energy levels the set UE is the union of several interval components, for\nwhich at least one interval component contains an equilibrium point.

We examine the case of a singular energy level E = 0 such that\nIE = R and IE contains at least two equilibrium points. One observes that if the equilibria can be regarded as periodic orbits then Theorem 49 would apply: a regularization\nargument makes this rigorous. Let E = 0 be the energy level in which UE is the concatenation of three interval components (\u2212\u221e, a]\u222a[a, b]\u222a[b, \u221e), i.e., the equilibria are a and b.\nWe remark that the nature of the equilibrium points is irrelevant; there is a global reason\nfor the existence of two unlinked periodic orbit in the energy levels E \u2208 (0, c0 ) for some\nsmall c0 > 0, see [58]. In these regular energy levels we can apply Theorem 49, and\na limit procedure ensures that the periodic solutions persist to the degenerate energy\nlevel E = 0, proving Theorem 2.\nRecall from [58] that two equilibrium points imply the existence of maximum u+ and\nminimum u\u2212 , both simple closed characteristics, see Fig. 17. Define the regions D+ =\n{(u1 , u2 ) | u2 \u2212 u1 > 0, u1 \u2265 a, u2 \u2264 b}, and D\u2212 = {(u1 , u2 ) | u\u22171 \u2264 u1 \u2264 a, b \u2264 u2 \u2264 u\u22172 },\nwhere (u\u22171 , u\u22172 ) is the point where the dissipativity condition of Definition 48 is satisfied.\nThen u+ \u2208 D+ and u\u2212 \u2208 D\u2212 .\nSince W2 is a C 2 -function on int(D+ ) it follows from Sard's theorem that there exists a\nregular value e+ such that 0 \u2264 max\u2202D+ W2 < e+ < maxD+ W2 . Consider the connected\ncomponent of the super-level set {W2 \u2265 e+ } which contains u+ . The outer boundary of\nthis component is a smooth circle and \u2207W2 points inwards on this boundary circle. Let\n\u0393+ be the interior of the outer boundary circle in question. By continuity it follows that\nthere exists a positive constant c0 such that \u0393+ remains an isolating neighborhood for\nE \u2208 (0, c0 ). In the following let E \u2208 (0, c0 ) be arbitrary.\n+\n+\n+\nDefine D1 = {(u1 , u2 ) | u2 \u2212 u1 \u2265 \u01eb, u\u2212\n1 \u2264 u1 \u2264 u1 , u2 \u2264 u2 } \u222a \u0393 . It follows from\nthe properties of S (see \u00a78) that D1 is again an isolating neighborhood, see Fig. 17. It\n\n\f44\n\nR.W. GHRIST, J.B. VAN DEN BERG, AND R.C.

The Morse\nrelations (39) yield\nCPt (\u0393+ ) + CPt (D1 \\\u0393+ ) = 1 + CPt (D1 \\\u0393+ ) = (1 + t)Qt ,\n\nwhere Qt is a nonnegative polynomial. This implies that D1 \\\u0393+ contains an index 1\n+\nsolution u1 . We can now define D2 = {(u1 , u2 ) | u2 \u2212 u1 \u2265 \u01eb, u+\n1 \u2264 u1 , u2 \u2264 u2 \u2264\n\u2212\n+\n2\nu2 } \u222a \u0393 . In exactly the same way we find an index 1 solution u \u2208 D2 . Notice, that by\nconstruction \u03b9(u1 , u2 ) = 0. Theorem 49 now yields an infinity of closed characteristics\nfor all 0 < E < c0 . As described in \u00a79.2 these periodic solutions can be characterized\nby p and q, where (p, q) is any pair of integers such that q < p and p and q are relative\nprime (or p = q = 1). Here 2p is the period of the solution up,q and 2q = \u03b9(up,q , u1 ) =\n\u03b9(up,q , u2 ).\nIn the limit E \u2192 0 the solutions u1 and u2 may collapse onto the two equilibrium\npoints (if they are centers). Nevertheless, the infinite family of solutions still exists in\nthe limit E = 0, because the extrema of the associated closed characteristics may only\ncoalesce in pairs at the equilibrium points. This follows from the uniqueness of the\ninitial value problem of the Hamiltonian system. Hence in the limit E \u2192 0 the type\n(p, q) of the periodic solution is conserved when we count extrema with multiplicity and\nintersections without multiplicity.\nNote that when the equilibria are saddle-foci then u1 and u2 stay away from \u00b11 in\nthe limit E \u2192 0. Extrema may still coalesce at the equilibrium points as E \u2192 0, but\nintersections are counted with respect to u1 and u2 . Finally, in the regular energy levels\nE \u2208 (0, c0 ), Theorem 49 provides at least two solutions of each type (except p = q = 1);\nin the limit E = 0 one cannot exclude the possibility that two solutions of the same type\ncoincide.\nRemark 54. Theorem 2, proved in this subsection, is immediately applicable to the\nSwift-Hohenberg model (3) as described in \u00a71. Notice that if the parameter \u03b1 satisifies\n\u03b1 > 1, then Theorem 2 yields the existence of infinitely many closed chararacteristics\n2\nat energy E = \u2212 (\u03b1\u22121)\n, and nearby levels. However from the physical point of view it\n4\nis also of interest to consider the case \u03b1 \u2264 1. In that case there exists only one singular\nenergy level and one equilibrium point. This case can be treated with our theory, but the\nnature of the equilibrium point comes into play. If an equilibrium point is a saddle or\nsaddle-focus, it is possible that no additional periodic orbits exist (see [57]). However, if\nthe equilibrium point is a center an initial non-simple closed characteristic can be found\nby analyzing an improper braid class, which by, Theorem 1, then yields infinitely many\nclosed characteristics. The techniques involved are very similar to those used in the\npresent and subsequent sections. We do not present the details here as this falls outside\nof the scope of this paper.\n9.4.4. Cases II and III: IE = [a, b] or IE = R\u00b1 . The remaining cases are dealt with in\nTheorem 3. We will restrict the proof here to the case that IE contains an equilibrium\npoint that is a saddle-focus - the center case can be treated as in [2].17 It also follows\n17Indeed, for energy levels E + c, c sufficiently small, a small simple closed charecteristic exists due to the\ncenter nature of the equilibrium point at E; spectrum {\u00b1ai, \u00b1bi}, a < b. This small simple closed characteristic will have a non-trivial rotation number close to ab .

[left] The gradient of W2 for the case of one saddle-focus\nequilibrium and compact boundary conditions. Clearly a saddle point\nis found in D. [right] The perturbation of one equilibrium to three equilibria.\nLet us first make some preliminary observations. When u\u2217 is a saddle-focus, then in\nE = 0 there exists a solution u1 such that u11 < u\u2217 < u12 . This follows from the fact that\nthere is a point (u\u22171 , u\u22172 ), u\u22171 < u\u22172 , close to (u\u2217 , u\u2217 ) at which the vector \u2207W2 points to the\nnorth-west (see Fig. 18 and [58]). This solution u1 is a saddle point, its rotation number\nbeing unknown. The impression is that (u\u2217 , u\u2217 ) is a minimum (with \u03c4 = 0), and if u\u2217\nwere a periodic solution, then one would have a linked pair (u\u2217 , u\u2217 ) and u1 to which\none could apply Theorem 45. Since u\u2217 is a saddle-focus it does not perturb to a periodic\nsolution for E > 0. Hence we need to use a different regularization which conveys the\ninformation that u\u2217 acts as a minimum. The form of the perturbation that we have in\nmind is depicted in Fig. 18, where we have drawn the \"potential\" L(u, 0, 0).\nThis idea can be formalized as follows. Choose a function T \u2208 C0\u221e [0, \u221e) such that\n0 \u2264 T (s) \u2264 1, T (s) = 1 for x \u2264 12 , T (s) strictly decreases on ( 12 , 1) and T (s) = 0 for\nx \u2265 1.

Set v1,\u00b1 = {vi1,\u00b1 }, vi1,\u00b1 =\n\u00b13, and v2,\u00b1 = {vi2,\u00b1 }, vi2,\u00b1 = \u00b11.

For r \u2265 1 set d := \u03c4\u221a0\u03bbr and define v3 := {vi3 }, with\n\u221a\nvi3 = u\nb(i), and v4 = {vi4 }, with vi4 = u\nb(i + \u03c40 / \u03bb), i = 0, ..., d. Clearly, \u03b9(v3 , v4 ) = r, for\nall \u221a1\u03bb \u2208 N.\nNext choose u\ne(x), a solution of (L\u03bb , dx) with u\nex (0) = 0 (minimum), which oscillates around both equilibria \u22122 and +2, and in between the equilibria \u22123 and +3, and\nT1 (A(e\nu)) = 2\u03c41 > 2\u03c0, \u03c41 \u2208 N.

Therefore, if we choose \u03bb\nsufficiently small, i.e. \u221a1\u03bb \u2208 N is large, then it also holds that \u03b9(v3,4 , v5,6 ) = 2p.\nFinally we choose the unique periodic solution u(x), with |u(x)| < 1, ux (0) = 0\n(minimum), and T1 (A(u)) = 2\u03c42 > 2\u03c0, \u03c42 \u2208 N.

GHRIST, J.B. VAN DEN BERG, AND R.C. VANDERVORST\n\nThe solution u is part of a hyperbolic circle of solutions us (x),\n\u221a s \u2208 R/Z. Define\n(u(s))s\u2208R/Z , with u(s) = {ui (s)}, where ui (s) = us (i + 2\u03c42 s/ \u03bb). As before, since\nthe intersection number of u\nb and us is equal to 2q, it holds that \u03b9(u(s), v3,4 ) = 2q, for \u03bb\nsufficiently small. Moreover, \u03b9(u(s), v5,6 ) = 2p. From this point on \u03bb is fixed. We now\nconsider three different skeleta v.\nI: v = {v2,\u2212 , v2,+ , v3 , v4 }. The relative braid class [u REL v]I is defined as follows:\n2,\u2212\nvi \u2264 ui \u2264 vi2,+ , and u links with\bthe strands v3 and v4 with intersection number 2q,\n0 \u2264 2q < r. The topological class u REL {v} is precisely that of Lemma 47 [Fig. 14]\nand as such is bounded and proper.\nII: v = {v2,\u2212 , v1,+ , v3 , v4 , v5 }. The relative braid class [u REL v]II is defined as follows: vi2,\u2212 \u2264 ui \u2264 vi1,+ , u links with the strands v3 and v4 with intersection number\n2q, 0 \u2264 2q < r, and u links with v5 with intersection number 2p. The topological class\n\b\nu REL {v} is precisely that of Lemma 53 [Fig. 16] and as such is bounded and proper.\nIII: v = {v2,\u2212 , v3 , v4 , v5 , v6 }. The relative braid class [u REL v]III is defined as follows: vi2,\u2212 \u2264 ui , u links with the strands v3 and v4 with intersection number\n2q, and u\n\b\nlinks with v5 and v6 with intersection number 2p. The topological class u REL {v} is\nnot bounded [Fig. 20[right]]. The augmentation of this braid class is bounded.\nCases I and II: Since the topological classes are bounded and proper, the invariant H is\nindependent of period of the chosen representative, and can be easily computed from\nthe integrable model. The closure of the collection of topologically equivalent braid\nclasses is an isolating neighborhood for the parabolic flow \u03a8t induced by the recurrence relation R\u03bb = 0 (defined via (L\u03bb , dx)). The invariant set is given by the normally\nhyperbolic circle {u(s)}s\u2208R/Z . For this reason the index H can be computed via the\nconnected component that contains the critical circle; we denote this neighborhood by\nN . The Conley index of N can be determined via computing W u ({u(s)}), the unstable\nmanifold associated to this circle. This computation is precisely that appearing in the\ncalculations of [2, pp. 372]: W u ({u(s)}) is orientable and of dimension 2q, and thus\n\u0001\n\u0001\n(53)\nH(u REL v) = h(N ) \u2243 S 1 \u00d7 S 2q\u22121 / S 1 \u00d7 {pt} \u2243 S 2q\u22121 \u2228 S 2q .\n\nThe Conley homology is given by CHk (H) = R for k = 2q \u2212 1, 2q, and CHk (H) = 0\nelsewhere.

Since the topological class u REL {v\u2217 } is bounded and\nproper, we may use the previous calculations to conclude that\nH(u REL v\u2217 ) \u2243 (S 1 \u00d7 S 2q\u22121 )/(S 1 \u00d7 {pt}) \u2243 S 2q\u22121 \u2228 S 2q .\n\nOur motivation for this computation is to complete the proof of Lemma 50. Let\n[u\u2032 REL v\u2032 ] denote the period 2p braid class described by Fig. 15, with intersection numbers denoted by 2q \u2032 and 2r\u2032 , and let [u REL v] denote a type-III braid of period 2p.

P OSTLUDE\n\n11.1. Extensions and questions: dynamics. There are several ways in which the basic\nmachinery introduced in this paper can be generalized to other dynamical systems.\n1. Scalar uniformly parabolic PDEs. Theorem 19 suggests strongly that the homotopy\nindex for discretized braids extends to and agrees with an analogous index for parabolic\ndynamics on spaces of smooth curves via uniformly parabolic PDE's. This is true [23].\n2. Periodicity in the range. Although we consider the anchor points to be in R, one may\njust as well constrain the anchor points to lie in S 1 and work in the universal cover. Such\nadditional structure is used in the theory of annulus twist maps [2, 7, 36, 37, 42]. All of\nour results immediately carry over to this setting. We note that compact-type boundary\nconditions necessarily follow.\n3. Aperiodic dynamics. One can also extend the theory to include braid diagrams with\n\"infinite length\" strands. To be more precise, consider braid diagrams on the infinite 1-d\nlattice, and omit the spatial periodicity. In this context several compactness issue come\ninto play. To name a few: (a) the parabolic flows generated by aperiodic recurrence\n\n\f50\n\nR.W. GHRIST, J.B. VAN DEN BERG, AND R.C. VANDERVORST\n\nrelations no longer live on a finite dimensional space but on the infinite dimensional\nspace l\u221e (R). See [2] for a case similar to this; (b) a priori, the Conley index should be\nreplaced with an infinite dimensional analogue such as that developed by Rybakowski\n[52]. However, if one considers braid diagrams with finite word metric, the stabilization\ntheory of \u00a75 allows one to define the necessary invariants via the finite dimensional\ntheory in this paper. This is not unlike the procedure one can follow in the treatment of\nparabolic PDE's [23].\n4. Fixed boundary conditions. Our decision to use closed braid diagrams is motivated\nby applications in Lagrangian systems; however, one can also fix the end points of the\nbraid diagrams. In this setting one can define a braid invariant in the same spirit as is\ndone for closed braids. The proof of stabilization is not sensitive to the type of boundary\nconditions used. Such an extension of the theory to include fixed endpoints is useful in\napplications to parabolic PDE's [23].\n5. Traveling waves and period orbits. The stationary solutions we find in this paper are\nbut the beginnings of a dynamical skeleton for the systems considered. The next logical\nstep would be to classify connecting orbits between stationary solutions: several authors\n(e.g., [40]) have considered these problems analytically in the context of traveling wave\nphenomena in monotone lattice dynamics. There is a precedent of using Conley indices\nto prove existence theorems for connecting orbits (e.g., [47]): we anticipate that such\napplications are possible in our setting. One could as well allow the skeletal strands to\nbe part of a periodic motion (in the case of non-exact recurrence relations). In this setting\none could look for both fixed points and periodic solutions of a given braid class.\n6. Long-range coupling. Assume that the recurrence relations Ri are functions of the form\nRi (ui\u2212n , . . . , ui+n ) for some n. Even if a strong monotonicity condition holds, \u2202j Ri > 0\nfor all j 6= i the proof of Proposition 11 still encounters a difficulty: two strands with\na simple (codimension-one) tangency can have enough local crossings to negate the\nparabolic systems' separation. Such monotone systems do exhibit an ordering principle\n[3, 26] (initially nonintersecting strands will never intersect), but additional braiding\nphenomena is not automatically present.\n7. Higher-dimensional lattice dynamics. In parabolic PDE's of spatial dimension greater\nthan one, the straightforward generalization of the lap number (number of connected\ncomponents of an intersection of graphs) does not obey a monotonicity property (due to\nthe fact that for graphs of Rn with n > 1, critical points of non-zero index and co-index\ncan pass through each other). Finding a suitable form of dynamics which retains some\nisolation remains an important and challenging problem.\n8. Arbitrary second-order Lagrangians. Our principal dynamical goal is to prove existence theorems for periodic orbits with a minimal amount of assumptions, particularly\n\"genericity\" assumptions (which are, in practice, rarely verifiable). To this end, we have\nbeen successful for second-order Lagrangians modulo the twist assumption. Although\nthis assumption is provably satisfied in numerous contexts, we believe that it is not,\nstrictly speaking, necessary. Its principal utility is in the reduction of the problem to a\nfinite-dimensional recurrence relation. We believe that the forcing results proved in \u00a78\nare valid for all second-order Lagrangian systems. See for instance [31] for a result on\nthat behalf. We propose that a version of the curve-shortening techniques in the spirit\n\n\fMORSE THEORY ON SPACES OF BRAIDS\n\n51\n\nof Angenent [4] should yield a homotopy index for smooth curves to which our forcing\ntheorems apply.\n\n11.2. Extensions and questions: topology. The homotopy index is, as a topological invariant of braid pairs, utterly useless. Nevertheless, there is topological meaning intrinsic to this index, the precise topological interpretation of which is as yet unclear. One\nobserves that the index captures some Morse-theoretic data about braid classes. Any\ntopological interpretation is certainly related to linking data of the free strands with the\nskeleton, as evidenced by the examples in this paper. Though the total amount of linking should provide some upper bound to the dimension of the homotopy index, linking\nnumbers alone are insufficient to characterize the homotopy index.\nWe close with several related questions about the homotopy index itself.\n1. Realization. It is clear that given any polynomial in t, there exists a braid pair whose\nhomological Poincar\u00e9 polynomial agrees with this. [Idea: take Example 3 of \u00a74 and\nstack disjoint copies of the skeleton vertically, using as many free copies and strands as\nnecessary to obtain the desired homology.] Can a realization theorem be proved for the\nhomotopy index itself? As a first step to this, consider replacing the real coefficients in\nthe homological index with integral coefficients. Does torsion ever occur? We believe\nnot, with the possible exception of a Z2 torsion.\n2. Product formulas and the braid group. Perhaps the most pressing problem for the homotopy index is to determine a product formula for the concatenation of two braids with\ncompatible skeleta. This would eliminate the need for computing the index via continuation to an integrable model system as in \u00a710. However, since we work on spaces of\nclosed braids, a product formula is not well-defined. The group structure on the braid\ngroup Bn does not extend naturally to a group structure on conjugacy classes: where\none \"cuts open\" the braid to effect a gluing can change the resulting braid class dramatically. The one instance in which a product operation is natural is a power of a closed\nbraid. Here, splitting the closed braid to an open braid and concatenating several copies\nthen reclosing yields equivalent closed braids independent of the representative of the\nconjugacy class chosen. Such a product/power formula, in conjunction with numerical\nmethods of index computation effective in moderately low dimensions, would allow\none to compute many invariants.\n3. Improper and unbounded classes In certain applications one also needs to deal with\nimproper braid classes [u REL v]. To such classes one can also assign an index. The\ninterpretation of the index as a Morse theory will not only depend on the topological\ndata, but also on the behavior of the flow \u03a8t at \u03a3\u2212 . The simplest case is when \u03a3\u2212 \u2229 \u2202N\nconsists of finitely many points. This for example happens when u consists of only one\nstrand. The homotopy index is then defined by the intrinsic definition in (15). The interpretation of the index and the associated Morse theory depends on the linearization\nD\u03a8t |\u03a3\u2212 \u2229\u2202N . The definition of the index in the case of more complicated sets \u03a3\u2212 \u2229 \u2202N\nand the Morse theoretic interpretation will be subject of future study. Similar considerations hold for unbounded classes.\n4. General braids. The types of braids considered in this paper are positive braids. Naturally, one wishes to extend the ideas to all braids; however, several complications arise.\n\n\f52\n\nR.W. GHRIST, J.B. VAN DEN BERG, AND R.C. VANDERVORST\n\nFirst, passing to discretized braids is invalid - knowing the anchor points is insufficient data for reconstructing the braid. Second, compactness is troublesome - one\ncannot merely bound braid classes via augmentation. We can model general braids\ndynamically using recurrence relations with nearest neighbor coupling allowing \"positive\", or \"negative\" interaction. This idea appears in the work of LeCalvez [36, 37]\nand can be translated to our setting via a change of variables - coordinate flips - of\nwhich our duality operator D is a particular example. However the compactness and\ndiscretization issues remain. LeCalvez works in the setting of annulus maps, where one\ncan circumvent these problems: the general setting is more problematic.\n5. Hamiltonian vs. Lagrangian. One approach to extending to arbitrary braids would be\nto switch from a Lagrangian setting to a Hamiltonian setting. Consider an S 1 family\nof Hamiltonians Ht on a symplectic surface (M 2 , \u03c9) which has a \"skeleton\" of periodic\norbits braided in M \u00d7 S 1 . Adding \"free\" braid strands, one could define a relative Floer\nindex for the system which should detect whether the free strands are forced to exist as\nperiodic orbits.\n\nR EFERENCES\n[1] N.N.

C ONSTRUCTION\n\nOF PARABOLIC FLOWS\n\nIn this appendix, we construct particular parabolic flows on braid diagrams in order\nto carry out the continuation arguments for the well-definedness of the Conley index for\nproper braid diagrams. The constructions are explicit and are generated by recurrence\nrelations R = (Ri )i\u2208Z , with Ri+d = Ri , which are of the form:\n\n(56)\n\nRi (r, s, t) = ai (r, s) + bi (s, t) + ci (s),\n\u2202ai\n\u2202r (r, s)\n\n> 0,\nwith ai , bi , ci \u2208 C 1 (R), and\nsuch recurrence relations are parabolic.\n\n\u2202bi\n\u2202t (s, t)\n\ni = 1, ..., d,\n\n\u2265 0 for all (r, s, t) \u2208 R3 . By definition,\n\nLemma 55. For any v \u2208 Ddm there exists a parabolic flow \u03a8t under which v is stationary.\n\nProof.\nIn order to have \u03a8t (v) = v, the sequences {v\u03b1 } need to satisfy\n\u03b1\n\u03b1 \u03b1\nRi (vi\u22121 , vi , vi+1 ) = 0, for some parabolic recurrence relation. We will construct R by\nspecifying the appropriate functions {ai , bi , ci } as above. In the construction to follow,\nthe reader should think of the anchor points {vi\u03b1 } of the fixed braid v as constants.\nFor each i such that the values {vi\u03b1 }\u03b1 are distinct, one may choose ai (r, s) = r,\nbi (s, t) = t, and ci (s) to be any C 1 function which interpolates the defined values\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\nci (vi\u03b1 ) := \u2212(vi\u22121\n+ vi+1\n).\n\nThis generates the desired parabolic flow.\n\u03b1\nIn the case where there are several strands \u03b11 , \u03b12 , . . . \u03b1n for which vi j = v \u2217 are all\nequal, the former construction is invalid: ci is not well-defined. According to Defini\u03b1j\n\u03b1j\n\u03b1k\n\u03b1k\n) < 0. This implies that if\n\u2212 vi+1\n)(vi+1\n\u2212 vi\u22121\ntion 4, we have for each \u03b1j 6= \u03b1k (vi\u22121\n\u03b1n\n\u03b12\n\u03b11\nwe order the {\u03b1j }j so that vi\u22121 < vi\u22121 < * * * < vi\u22121 , then the corresponding sequence\n\u03b1j\n\u03b1n\u22121\n\u03b11\n\u03b1n\n. From Lemma 56 below, there exist increas< * * * < vi+1\n< vi+1\n}j satisfies vi+1\n{vi+1\ning functions f and g such that\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b1\n\nj\nj\n\u03b1k\n\u03b1k\n) \u2200j, k.\n) \u2212 f (vi\u22121\n) = g(vi+1\n) \u2212 g(vi+1\nf (vi\u22121\n\nDefine ai and bi in the following manner: set ai (r, v \u2217 ) := f (r) and bi (v \u2217 , t) := g(t). Thus\nit follows that there exists a well defined value\n\u03b1j \u0001\n\u03b1j\n)\n) + g(vi+1\nci (v \u2217 ) := \u2212 f (vi\u22121\n\n\fMORSE THEORY ON SPACES OF BRAIDS\n\n55\n\nwhich is independent of j. For any other strands \u03b1\u2032 , repeat the procedure, defining\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nthe slices ai (r, vi\u03b1 ), bi (vi\u03b1 , t) and the points ci (vi\u03b1 ), choosing new functions f and g\nif necessary. To extend these functions to global functions ai (r, s) and bi (s, t), simply perform a C 1 homotopy in s without changing the monotonicity in the r and t\n\u2032\nvariables: e.g., on the interval [vi\u03b1 , vi\u03b1 ], choose a monotonic function \u03be(s) for which\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u03be(vi\u03b1 ) = \u03be \u2032 (vi\u03b1 ) = \u03be \u2032 (vi\u03b1 ) = 0 and \u03be(vi\u03b1 ) = 1. Then set\n\u2032\n\nai (r, s) := (1 \u2212 \u03be(s))ai (r, vi\u03b1 ) + \u03be(s)ai (r, vi\u03b1 ).\n\nSuch a procedure, performed on the appropriate s-intervals, yields a smooth rmonotonic interpolation. Repeat with bi (s, t). Finally, choose any function ci (s) which\nsmoothly interpolates the preassigned values. These choices of ai , bi and ci give the\ndesired recurrence relation, and consequently the parabolic flow \u03a8t .\nLemma 56. Given two sequences of increasing real numbers x1 < x2 < * * * < xn and y1 <\ny2 < * * * < yn , there exist a pair of strictly increasing functions f and g such that\n(57)\n\nf (xj ) \u2212 f (xk ) = g(yj ) \u2212 g(yk ) \u2200j, k\n\nProof. Induct on n, noting the triviality of the case n = 1. Given increasing sequences\n+1\n+1\n, choose functions f and g which satisfy (57) for j, k \u2264 N : this\n(xi )N\nand (yi )N\n1\n1\nis a restriction on f and g only for values in [x1 , xN ] since outside of this domain the\nfunctions can be arbitrary as long as they are increasing. Thus, modify f and g outside\nthis interval to satisfy\nf (xN +1 ) = f (xN ) + C ; g(yN +1 ) = g(yN ) + C,\nfor some fixed constant C > 0. These functions satisfy (57) for all j and k.\nLemma 57. For any pair of equivalent braids [u(0)] = [u(1)], there exists a path u(\u03bb) in Ddn\nand a continuous family of parabolic flows \u03a8t\u03bb , such that \u03a8t\u03bb (u(\u03bb)) = u(\u03bb), for all \u03bb \u2208 [0, 1].\n\nProof. Given u any point in Ddn , consider any parabolic recurrence relation Ru which\nfixes u and which is strictly monotonic in r and t. From the proof of Lemma 55, Ru\nexists. For every braid u\u2032 sufficiently close to u, there exists \u03c6 a near-identity diffeomorphism of Ddn which maps u to u\u2032 . The recurrence relation Ru \u25e6 \u03c6\u22121 fixes u\u2032 and is still\nparabolic since \u03c6 cannot destroy monotonicity. Choosing a short smooth path \u03c6t of such\ndiffeomorphisms to I D proves the lemma on small neighborhoods in Ddn , which can be\npieced together to yield arbitrary paths.\nD EPARTMENT OF M ATHEMATICS , U NIVERSITY OF I LLINOIS , U RBANA IL, 61801 USA\nD EPARTMENT OF A PPLIED M ATHEMATICS , U NIVERSITY OF N OTTINGHAM , UK\nD EPARTMENT OF M ATHEMATICS , F REE U NIVERSITY A MSTERDAM , D E B OELELAAN 1081, A MSTERDAM\nN ETHERLANDS ; AND CDSNS, G EORGIA I NSTITUTE OF T ECHNOLOGY, ATLANTA GA, 30332-0160 USA\n\n\fu\n\nu\n\nx\n\nd\n\nx\n\n\fSig\nS\n\nK\n\nn\nD\n\nd\nA\n\nb\n\ne\n\n0\na\n\nC\nN\n\ny\nzM\n\nx\n\nB\n\nc\n\n\fS\nN\nD\n\nn\n\nM\n\n0\ne\nx2\n\nK\nC\n\nu'\n\nx1\n\nO\n\nA\n\nx2\n\nB\nu\n\nD\nO\n\nA\n\nB\n\nC\n\nD\n\n\f"}
