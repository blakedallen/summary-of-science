The non-Abelian Lie algebra\ngauge symmetry on the worldvolume of multiple D-branes was also a crucial ingredient\nin the recent developments in non-perturbative string theory. It was also essential in the\nmatrix model proposals [2, 3] which use dimensionally reduced super Yang-Mills theory\nfor definition.\nFilippov n-algebra [4] is a natural generalization of Lie algebra. It began to attract\nwide attention from physicists recently after it appeared in a candidate model for multiple\nM2-branes [5, 6, 7, 8].\nSo far studies involving Filippov n-algebra in physics have been largely concentrated on\nthe Filippov 3-algebra appearing in the multiple M2-brane model.1 It will be interesting\nto look for other situations where Filippov n-algebra plays a role.\nIn this paper, we study generalizations of reduced super Yang-Mills theory obtained by\nreplacing the Lie algebra structure to Filippov n-algebra, and examine when the reduced\nactions are supersymmetric. Reduced model is a candidate framework for a constructive\ndefinition of fundamental theory [3], and supersymmetry is expected to be a vital element\nin such a framework.\nAnother motivation for this study comes from a trial to relate the multiple M2-brane\naction with some covariant formalism, possibly the single M5-brane action [11, 12, 13, 14,\n15] (see also [16]). In particular, Ref.[14] studied this issue from the viewpoint of spacetime supersymmetry algebra. Although results in the above works suggest such a relation,\ncomplete understanding is still missing. In this paper, we will show that our reduced\nmodels have the same structure with a covariant Green-Schwarz type supermembrane\naction written in the membrane analogue of the Schild action [17]. This result will be a\nuseful guide for understanding the above issue.\n\n2\n\nFilippov n-algebra\n\nIn this section we briefly review the necessary ingredients of Filippov n-algebra. The\npresentation in this section closely follows Ref.[18].\nFilippov n-algebra [4], also known as n-Lie algebra, is a natural generalization of Lie\nalgebra. (In this paper we will sometimes call it just n-algebra for short.) For a linear\nP V\nspace V = dim\na=1 va Ta ; va \u2208 C, Filippov n-algebra structure is defined by a multi-linear\n1\n\nWith a notable exception of the Nambu bracket [9] which can be used to define a classic example\nof Filippov 3-algebra. Quantization of Nambu bracket and/or its application to brane models have been\nsubjects of interests, see e.g. [10] and references therein.\n\n1\n\n\fmap which we call n-bracket [\u2217, * * * , \u2217] : V \u2297n \u2192 V satisfying the following properties:\n1.

Its action is given by\n1\n1\nS = h[XI , XJ ], [X I , X J ]i + h\u03a8\u0304, \u0393I [X I , \u03a8]i.\n4\n2\n\n(3.1)\n\nHere, X I (I = 1, * * * , 10) is a vector in ten dimensional flat target space-time and \u03a8\nis a space-time Majorana-Weyl spinor, both take values in U(N) Lie-algebra. \u0393I 's are\n2\n\n\fgamma matrices in ten dimension. Repeated vector indices are contracted by space-time\nmetric \u03b7IJ = diag(+, \u2212, * * * , \u2212). We have used the Filippov n-algebra notations (n = 2\nfor ordinary Lie algebra) described in the previous section. The inner product is given by\nthe invariant trace of the Lie algebra.\nThe action (3.1) is invariant under the following supersymmetry transformation:\n\u03b4X I = i\u01ed\u0393I \u03a8,\ni\n\u03b4\u03a8 = [X I , X J ]\u0393IJ \u01eb.\n2\n\n(3.2)\n\nA natural generalization of the action (3.1) based on Filippov (p + 1)-algebra would\nbe\nS=\n\n1\nh[XI1 , * * * , XIp+1 ][X I1 , * * * , X Ip+1 ]i\n2(p + 1)!\n\u03c3\n+ h\u03a8\u0304, \u0393I1 ***Ip [X I1 , * * * , X Ip , \u03a8]i.\n2\n\n(3.3)\n\nHere \u03c3 is a factor 1 or i determined from the Hermiticity of the action. X I (I = 1, * * * , D)\nis a vector in D-dimensional flat target space-time and \u03a8 is a space-time spinor, both take\nvalue in (p + 1)-algebra. \u0393I 's are D dimensional gamma matrices satisfying\n\u0393I \u0393J + \u0393J \u0393I = 2\u03b7IJ ,\n\n(3.4)\nt\n\ns\n\nz }| { z }| {\nwhere \u03b7IJ is now D-dimensional flat metric with \u03b7IJ = diag(+, * * * , +, \u2212, * * * , \u2212). We\nallow the number of the time-like directions to be general t. \u0393I1 ***Ip is an anti-symmetrized\nproduct of gamma matrices with \"strength one\".\nThe action (3.3) is invariant under a transformation\n\u03b4\u03a6a = \u039ba1 ***ap fa1 ***ap b a \u03a6b ,\n\n\u03a6a = X Ia , \u03a8a ,\n\n(3.5)\n\ndue to the fundamental identity (2.2) and the invariance of the inner product (2.5). This\nis a natural generalization of the dimensionally reduced gauge symmetry of the action\n(3.1).\nIn this paper, we examine in which case the following supersymmetry transformation\n\u03b4X I = c1 \u01ed\u0393I \u03a8,\n\u03b4\u03a8 = c2 [X I1 , * * * , X Ip+1 ]\u0393I1 ***Ip+1 \u01eb,\n\n(3.6)\n\nleaves the action (3.3) invariant. Here, c1 and c2 are coefficients to be adjusted. We\nwill keep the Filippov algebra to be general, i.e. we will not use any property specific\nto a particular Filippov algebra. The conditions we may impose on fermions are the\n3\n\n\fstandard ones, i.e. (pseudo-)Majorana condition and Weyl condition. We will not consider\nprojections on fermions which break the SO(t, s) Lorentz symmetry. In order for the\nsecond term in the action (3.3) to be not identically zero, when we impose Weyl condition\non fermions t + p must be even, and when fermions are Majorana-spinors \u0393I1 ***Ip C must\nbe symmetric in spinor indices. Here, C is the charge conjugation matrix. The properties\nof gamma matrices and spinors in diverse dimensions are summarized in appendix A.\nLet us first study the variation of the action which has one fermion. The variation of\nthe second term in the action (3.3) containing one fermion has a form\nh\u01ed\u0393J1 ***Jp+1 \u0393I1 ***Ip [XJ1 , * * * , XJp+1 ][XI1 , * * * , XIp , \u03a8]i\n\n= \u2212h\u01ed\u0393J1 ***Jp+1 \u0393I1 ***Ip [XI1 , * * * , XIp , [XJ1 , * * * , XJp+1 ]]\u03a8i,\n\n(3.7)\n\nwhere we have used the invariance of the inner product (2.5). One can rearrange the\nordering of the gamma matrices into a sum of totally anti-symmetrized gamma matrices\nusing (3.4):\n\u0393J1 ***Jp+1 \u0393I1 ***Ip = \u0393J1 ***Jp+1 I1 ***Ip\n[I\n\n+ (\u2212)p \u03b4[J11 \u0393J2 ***Jp+1] I2 ***Ip ]\n[I\n\n+ \u03b4[J11 \u03b4JI22 \u0393J2 ***Jp+1 ] I3 ***Ip ]\n+ ***\n\nI ]\n\n[I\n\n+ (\u2212)p \u03b4[J11 * * * \u03b4Jpp \u0393Jp+1] ,\n\n(3.8)\n\nwhere the square brackets on Lorentz indices denote total anti-symmetrization with appropriate \"strength\" (it will be relevant only for the last term). On the other hand, using\nthe fundamental identity (2.2) one can show\n\u0393I1 ***Ir J1 ***Jr+1 [A1 , * * * , Ap\u2212r , XI1 , * * * , XIr , [A1 , * * * , Ap\u2212r , XJ1 , * * * , XJr+1 ]] = 0,\n\n(3.9)\n\nfor r 6= 0, with pairs of the same entries A1 , * * * , Ap\u2212r . Due to (3.9) the terms from (3.7)\narising from the rearrangement of the gamma matrices (3.8) mostly vanish; only the r = 0\nterm remains which cancels the similar term coming from the variation of the first term\nin the action (3.3).\nNext, let us examine the variation of the action containing three fermions. Since\nthe structure constant fa1 ***ap+1 b is anti-symmetric in indices a1 * * * ap+1 due to the skewsymmetric property (2.1), the variation containing three fermions vanishes when\n[a\n\na ]\n\n(\u0393I )\u03b1 \u03b2 (\u0393IJ1***Jp\u22121 )\u03b3 \u03b4 \u03a8\u03b2 1 \u03a8\u0304a\u03b32 \u03a8\u03b4 3 = 0,\n\n(3.10)\n\nwhere the square bracket denotes the total anti-symmetrization in the (p + 1)-algebra\nindices. (3.10) is equivalent to\n(\u0393I P )\u03b1 (\u03b2 (\u0393IJ1 ***Jp\u22121 P )\u03b3 \u03b4) = 0,\n4\n\n(3.11)\n\n\fwhen \u03a8's are complex spinors, where P is a chiral projection when \u03a8's are Weyl spinors\nand 1 otherwise, and\n(\u0393I CP )\u03b1(\u03b2 (\u0393IJ1 ***Jp\u22121 CP )\u03b3\u03b4) = 0,\n\n(3.12)\n\nwhen \u03a8's are (pseudo-)Majorana(-Weyl) spinors. From an argument similar to the one\nin [19], when (3.10) is satisfied it follows that\n1\nD \u2212 p \u2212 1 = nf ,\n2\n\n(3.13)\n\nwhere nf is the spinor size of the fermions \u03a8 counted in the real number.2 We provide\na proof in the appendix B. One can also check that (3.13) is a sufficient condition for\n(3.10) to vanish by expanding the left hand side of (3.11) or (3.12) by complete basis of\nmatrices with indices \u03b1 and \u03b2. We list the cases with p \u2265 2 when (3.10) is satisfied in\nTable 1 (p = 1 case is the ordinary Lie-algebra case which can be easily included). The\ncolumns for \u03b8 and n\u03b8 in the table are about corresponding super p-branes which we will\ndiscuss in section 5.\nD\n4\n5\n5\n6\n\nt\n2\n2\n3\n3\n\np\n2\n2\n2\n3\n\n\u03a8\n(pseudo-)Majorana-Weyl\nMajorana\npseudo-Majorana\n(pseudo-)Majorana-Weyl\n\nnf\n2\n4\n4\n4\n\n\u03b8\n(pseudo-)Majorana\nDirac\nDirac\nWeyl\n\nn\u03b8\n4\n8\n8\n8\n\nTable 1: The dimension of the target space-time D and the number of its time-like\ndimensions t where the supersymmetric reduced model with (p + 1)-algebra symmetry\nand corresponding Green-Schwarz type super p-brane exist.

However, we haven't shown its relation to the standard\nsupersymmetry algebra, namely super Poincar\u00e9 algebra. Let us examine this point in this\nsection.\nWe again take the case D = 4, t = 2, p = 2 for explicitly. Other cases are similar. In\n(3.14), the fermions are pseudo-Majorana-Weyl spinors:\nC \u03a8\u0304T = \u03a8,\n\nP+ \u03a8 = \u03a8,\n\n(4.1)\n\nwhere\n1 \u00b1 \u03935\n, \u03935 \u2261 \u03931 \u03932 \u03933 \u03934 .\n(4.2)\n2\nIt is important to notice that when the 3-algebra has a central element, there is a fermionic\nshift symmetry:4\nP\u00b1 \u2261\n\n\u03b4+ X I = 0,\n\n\u03b4+ \u03a8a = \u03b4 a\u2299 \u01eb+ ,\n\n(4.3)\n\nwhere \u2299 denotes the central element: [T\u2299 , Ta , Tb ] = 0 for \u2200 Ta , Tb . The commutation\nrelations of the two fermionic transformations turn out to be\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(\u03b4+ (\u01eb+ )\u03b4+ (\u01eb+ ) \u2212 (1 \u2194 2))\u03a6 = 0,\n\n\u03a6 = X I , \u03a8,\n\n(\u03b4+ (\u01eb+ )\u03b4\u2212 (\u01eb\u2212 ) \u2212 \u03b4\u2212 (\u01eb\u2212 )\u03b4+ (\u01eb+ ))X Ia = \u03b4 a\u2299 i\u01ed\u2212 \u0393I \u01eb+ ,\n(\u03b4+ (\u01eb+ )\u03b4\u2212 (\u01eb\u2212 ) \u2212 \u03b4\u2212 (\u01eb\u2212 )\u03b4+ (\u01eb+ ))\u03a8 = 0,\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(\u03b4\u2212 (\u01eb\u2212 )\u03b4\u2212 (\u01eb\u2212 ) \u2212 (1 \u2194 2))\u03a6a = \u039ba b \u03a6b ,\n\n3\n\n(4.4)\n(4.5)\n(4.6)\n\nActually in the action (3.14), the difference between Majorana-Weyl fermions and pseudo-Majorana\nfermions is just a matter of convention: The difference arises from the choice of the charge conjugation\nmatrix C\u03b7\u2032 =1 (for Majorana fermions) or C\u03b7\u2032 =\u22121 (for pseudo-Majorana fermions) in (A.2) in the appendix\nA, which are related as C\u03b7\u2032 =1 = \u03935 C\u03b7\u2032 =\u22121 . Using the Weyl condition on fermions, one can see that the\naction for pseudo-Majorana-Weyl fermions and that for Majorana-Weyl fermions are exactly the same.\n4\nThe role of the fermionic shift symmetry in the multiple M2-brane model was studied extensively in\n[14].\n\n6\n\n\fwhere\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n\u039ba b = if bcd a XcK XdL \u01ed\u2212 \u0393KL \u01eb\u2212 .\n\n(4.7)\n\nHere, \u03b4+ (\u01eb+ ) and \u03b4\u2212 (\u01eb\u2212 ) denote the fermionic shift (4.3) with parameter \u01eb+ and supersymmetry transformation (3.6) with parameter \u01eb\u2212 , respectively. (4.5) is a translation in\nthe target space-time. Thus the supersymmetry transformation (3.15) together with the\nfermionic shift (4.3) form target space-time super Poincar\u00e9 algebra, modulo the right hand\nside of (4.6) which has a form of the symmetry transformation (3.5). We will use Nmin to\ncount the number of supersymmetry in the unit of the minimal spinor. In this notation,\nour model has Nmin = 2 space-time supersymmetry when there is a central element in\nthe algebra, since the minimal spinor in D = 4, t = 2 is (pseudo-)Majorana-Weyl spinor.\nHowever, as can be seen from (4.5) it is not possible to construct Nmin = 1 space-time\nsuper Poincar\u00e9 algebra in four dimension by using just one minimal spinor. In this sense\nNmin = 2 supersymmetry is minimal in D = 4, t = 2 and hence it is what should be\ncalled N = 1 supersymmetry.\nSo far we have been studying super Poincar\u00e9 algebra in four dimension. However, the\nsupersymmetry transformation (3.15) can form super Poincar\u00e9 algebra in three dimension\nwhen particular background is chosen. As an example, let us choose the 3-algebra to be\nNambu-Poisson bracket in R2,1 :\n[f (y), g(y), h(y)] = i\u01ebijk \u2202i f (y)\u2202j g(y)\u2202k h(y),\n\n(4.8)\n\nZ\n\n(4.9)\n\nhf (y), g(y)i =\n\nd3 yf (y)g(y),\n\nwhere y i (i = 1, 2, 3) are flat coordinates on R2,1 and \u01ebijk is the Levi-Civita symbol. We\nconsider following background configuration:\nX I (y) = y I\n\n(I = 1, 2, 3),\n\nX 4 (y) = 0.\n\n(4.10)\n\nThen, (4.7) becomes\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(\u03b4\u2212 (\u01eb\u2212 )\u03b4\u2212 (\u01eb\u2212 ) \u2212 (1 \u2194 2))\u03a6\u0303 \u223c \u01ebijk \u01ed\u2212 \u0393jk \u01eb\u2212 \u2202i \u03a6\u0303 + * * * ,\n\n(4.11)\n\nwhere \u03a6\u0303 are fluctuation of the fields around the background (4.10). To see this is a super\nPoincar\u00e9 algebra in three dimension, one decomposes gamma matrices and supersymmetry\ntransformation parameters to those for three dimension. Then (4.11) can be rewritten as\n(\u03b4\u2212 (\u03b6 (1) )\u03b4\u2212 (\u03b6 (2) ) \u2212 (1 \u2194 2))\u03a6\u0303 \u223c \u03b6\u0304 (1) \u03b3 i \u03b6 (2) \u2202i \u03a6\u0303 + * * * ,\n7\n\n(4.12)\n\n\fwhere * * * can be combined into a form of gauge transformation [12] and \u03b3 i i = 1, 2, 3 and\n\u03b6 are gamma matrices and supersymmetry transformation parameters in three dimension.\nTo keep \u03a6\u0303 = 0 configuration to preserve supersymmetry, one also needs to combine the\nfermionic shift (4.3) [12]. Thus in the background (4.10) the supersymmetry transformation (3.15) appropriately combined with the fermionic shift (4.3) can be regarded as super\nPoincar\u00e9 symmetry in three dimension.\n\nRelation to Nmin = 2 super p-branes\n\n5\n\nIn this section we show that our supersymmetric reduced model actions can be related\nto Green-Schwarz type Nmin = 2 super p-action in the Schild-type form, parallel to the\nrelation between the large N reduced model action of super Yang-Mills theory and GreenSchwarz superstring action [3].5 To be explicit, we again take D = 4, t = 2, p = 2 case as\nan example. Discussions are parallel in other cases listed in Table 1.\nThe super p-brane action with p = 2, i.e. the supermembrane action is given by\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\n1\u221a\n1\u221a\nij I J\nijk A B C\n3\n\u2212gg Ei Ej \u03b7IJ \u2212\n\u2212g + \u01eb Ei Ej Ek BCBA ,\n(5.1)\nSGS = d y\n2\n2\nwhere we take the worldvolume signature as (+ + \u2212) and A = (I, \u03b1), and\ni\nEiI = \u2202i X I \u2212 \u03b8\u0304\u0393I \u2202i \u03b8,\n2\n\nEi\u03b1 = \u2202i \u03b8\u03b1 .\n\n(5.2)\n\nHere, \u03b8 is a pseudo-Majorana spinor in D = 4, t = 2 target space-time:\nC \u03b8\u0304T = \u03b8.\n\n(5.3)\n\nBABC is determined from dB = H and dH = 0, where\n1 A B C\nE E E BABC ,\n3!\n1 A B C D\nE E E E HABCD ,\nH =\n4!\nB =\n\nE A = EiA dy i ,\n\n(5.4)\n\nand the only non-zero components of HABCD are those with two spinor and two vector\nindices:\ni\nH\u03b1\u03b2IJ = \u2212 (C \u22121T \u0393IJ )\u03b1\u03b2 .\n6\n5\n\n(5.5)\n\nGreen-Schwarz type supermembrane actions with general space-time signatures have been studied\nin [20]. However, there study was restricted to Nmin = 1 case in our terminology, and Nmin = 2\nsupersymmetry which we discuss in this paper was not considered there.\n\n8\n\n\fThe closure of H is equivalent to the identity\n(\u0393I C)(\u03b1\u03b2 \u0393IJ C\u03b3\u03b4) = 0.\n\n(5.6)\n\nFrom this condition one obtains the matching of on-shell degrees of freedom between\nbosons and fermions when 2 < p + 1 < d [19]:\n1\nD \u2212 (p + 1) = nmin Nmin ,\n4\n\n(5.7)\n\nwhere nmin is the dimension of the minimal spinor. (5.7) is satisfied for p = 2, D = 4,\nNmin = 2 with pseudo-Majorana-Weyl spinor as the minimal spinor; nmin = 2. Indeed,\none can show that (5.6) is satisfied in this case.\nThe action (5.1) is invariant under the following global space-time supersymmetry\ntransformation:\ni\n\u03b4X I = \u01ed\u0393I \u03b8,\n2\n\n\u03b4\u03b8 = \u01eb.\n\n(5.8)\n\nIn terms of the minimal spinor, the action has Nmin = 2 non-chiral space-time supersymmetry.\nThe action (5.1) also has the local fermionic gauge symmetry:\ni\n\u03b4X I = \u03b8\u0304\u0393I (1 + \u0393)\u03ba,\n2\n\n\u03b4\u03b8 = (1 + \u0393)\u03ba,\n\n(5.9)\n\nwhere\n\u0393\u2261\n\n1\n\u221a \u01ebijk EiI EjJ EkK \u0393IJK .\n3! \u2212g\n\n(5.10)\n\nThe transformation law for the worldvolume metric gij can be determined as in [21].\nTo relate the supermembrane action with our reduced model action (3.14), we fix the\nfermionic gauge symmetry by the condition6\nP\u2212 \u03b8 = 0,\n\n(5.11)\n\nwhere\n1\nP\u00b1 \u2261 (1 \u00b1 \u03935 ),\n2\n\n\u03935 = \u03931 \u03932 \u03933 \u03934 .\n\n(5.12)\n\nThe supersymmetry transformation must be combined with the global part of the fermionic\ngauge transformation to maintain the gauge condition (5.11). Then the supersymmetry\ntransformation becomes\n\u03b4X I = i\u01ed\u2212 \u0393I \u03a8,\n6\n\n(5.13)\n\nThis gauge condition is appropriate for configurations which break the part of the supersymmetry\ngenerated by \u01eb+ .\n\n9\n\n\f\u03b4\u03a8 = \u01eb+ \u2212 \u0393\u01eb\u2212 ,\n\n(5.14)\n\nwhere \u03a8 = P+ \u03b8. After the gauge fixing (5.11), the action takes the form\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\n1\u221a\ni ijk\n1\u221a\nI\nJ\nij\nI\nJ\n3\n\u2212gg \u2202i X \u2202j X \u03b7IJ \u2212\n\u2212g \u2212 \u01eb \u2202i X \u2202j X \u03a8\u0304\u0393IJ \u2202k \u03a8 . (5.15)\nSGS = d y\n2\n2\n4\nThis action is classically equivalent to the following Schild type action:\nZ\n1\nSSchild =\nd3 y w(y)\n2\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1 IJ\n1 I J K\n\u2212 {X , X , X }{XI , XJ , XK } \u2212 \u03a8\u0304\u0393 {XI , XJ , \u03a8} + 1 , (5.16)\n6\n2\nwhere w(y) is identified with the volume density and {\u2217, \u2217, \u2217} is the Nambu-Poisson\nbracket\n{f, g, h} \u2261\n\ni ijk\n\u01eb \u2202i f \u2202j g\u2202k h.\nw(y)\n\n(5.17)\n\nThe action (5.16) can be identified with our supersymmetric reduced model (3.14) with\n3-algebra being the Nambu-Poisson bracket (5.17). The supersymmetry transformation\nnow becomes\n\u03b4X I = i\u01ed\u2212 \u0393I \u03a8,\n\n(5.18)\n\ni\n\u03b4\u03a8 = \u01eb+ + {X I , X J , X K }\u0393IJK \u01eb\u2212 .\n6\n\n(5.19)\n\nThe fermionic shift symmetry with the parameter \u01eb+ is identical to (4.3), and the supersymmetry transformation parametrized by \u01eb\u2212 is identical to (3.6).\nSimilar discussions go through in other cases listed in the Table 1. D = 5 models are\nrelated with D = 6 model by a (formal) double dimensional reduction. In all cases n\u03b8 is\nthe minimal size of the spinor needed to have super Poincar\u00e9 algebra and it is twice as big\nas the size of the minimal spinor nmin in that space-time dimension and signature. Thus all\nsuper p-brane actions in the Table 1 have N = 1, Nmin = 2 target space supersymmetry.\nNote that the condition for the existence of the Green-Schwarz type super p-branes (5.7)\ncoincides with the condition for the existence of the supersymmetric reduced models (3.13)\nwith nf = nmin and Nmin = 2, as it should be.\n\n6\n\nSummary and future directions\n\nIn this paper, we constructed supersymmetric reduced model actions with a symmetry\nbased on Filippov algebra. These models are natural generalizations of the reduced model\n10\n\n\fof super Yang-Mills theory. The supersymmetry transformation itself involves the Filippov\nalgebra structure, and our models compactly exhibit interrelation between supersymmetry\nand the Filippov algebra symmetry.\nThe supersymmetric reduced models were related with what we call Nmin = 2 super pbrane actions. In rewriting the super p-brane actions in the form of our reduced models,\nthere was no truncation of the terms of the super p-brane actions. Since our models\ncapture the aspects of the symmetries in a compact form, they will provide a good guidance\nfor the issue of relating the multiple M2-brane model with some covariant formalism\n[11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. Our models have a nice feature that the D-dimensional Lorentz\ncovariance is manifest. This was due to Nmin = 2 supersymmetry which allowed us to fix\nthe fermionic gauge symmetry in the Lorentz covariant form (5.11).7 This is in contrast\nto the multiple M2-brane model or super p-branes in the light-cone gauge which have\nsimilar algebraic structures [23, 24], and may become an advantage for understanding the\nstructure of the space-time at more fundamental level. In particular, it will be useful for\ndescribing space-time uncertainty principle covariantly [25].\nOne of the advantage of reduced models is that the path integral reduces to ordinary\nintegral and sometimes explicit integration is possible, e.g. [26, 27, 28]. Together with\nthe highly symmetric nature of our models, we may be able to perform the path integral\nexplicitly and learn quantum aspects of the models with those symmetries.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank Pei-Ming Ho, Yutaka Matsuo, Jeong-Hyuck Park, Sheng-Yu\nDarren Shih and Tomohisa Takimi for useful discussions.

See [29] for more detail.\n7\n\nWhile we were completing this work, a paper [22] appeared which proposed a reduced model with Filippov 3-algebra structure as a covariant formulation of M-theory. Only the bosonic part was constructed\nin that paper. Since M-theory has N = Nmin = 1 supersymmetry of eleven dimensional space-time as\nopposed to our Nmin = 2 models, one cannot follow our approach in their model.

Since\nwe have doubled the size of the spinors when the fermions \u03a8 are complex spinors, we can\nalways go to a real basis by a similarity transformation. Therefore (B.8) is equivalent to\n(\u03a3I P)\u03b1(\u03b2 (Z\u03a3IJ1 ***Jp\u22121 P)\u03b3\u03b4) = 0,\n\n(B.10)\n\nwhere for complex spinors\nP=\n\nP 0\n0 P\u0303 T\n\n!\n\n(B.11)\n\nwith P\u0303 = P for t even and P\u0303 = 1\u2212P for t odd for Weyl spinors and P = P\u0303 = 1 otherwise,\nand P = P for (pseudo-)Majorana spinors. Contracting (B.10) with (\u03a3\u0303K )\u03b2\u03b1 we obtain\nnf (Z\u03a3KJ1 ***Jp\u22121 P)\u03b3\u03b4 + 2(Z\u03a3IJ1 ***Jp\u22121 \u03a3\u0303K \u03a3I P)\u03b3\u03b4 = 0,\n\n(B.12)\n\nwhere nf is the spinor size of fermions \u03a8 counted in real number. From (B.12) we obtain\n(nf \u2212 2(D \u2212 p \u2212 1))(Z\u03a3KJ1***Jp\u22121 P)\u03b3\u03b4 = 0.\n15\n\n(B.13)\n\n\fThus we have obtained Eq.(B.1):\n1\nD \u2212 p \u2212 1 = nf\n2\n\n(B.14)\n\nas a necessary condition for Eq.(B.2) to vanish. One can check that it is also a sufficient\ncondition.\nThe derivation of Eq.(5.7) is similar, the main difference is the spinor size n\u03b8 of the\nspace-time spinor field \u03b8 and the fact that in (B.10) only three spinor indices are symmetrized whereas in the case of super p-brane the closure of H leads to a condition\n(\u03a3I P)(\u03b1\u03b2 (Z\u03a3IJ1 ***Jp\u22121 P)\u03b3\u03b4) = 0,\n\n(B.15)\n\ni.e. four spinor indices are symmetrized. From (B.15) one obtains [19]\n1\nD \u2212 p \u2212 1 = n\u03b8 ,\n4\n\n(B.16)\n\nfor 2 < p + 1 < D. In all the cases listed in the Table 1, nf = nmin and n\u03b8 = nmin \u00d7 Nmin\nwith Nmin = 2. The difference of the factors 12 and 14 in (B.10) and (B.16) is a consequence\nof the fact that in (B.10) three spinor indices were symmetrized whereas in (B.15) four\nspinor indices were symmetrized. Since the supersymmetric reduced model actions are\nobtained after fixing the fermionic gauge symmetry of the super p-brane actions which\nreduces the degrees of freedom of \u03b8 by half, i.e. nf = 21 n\u03b8 , this difference of the factors is\nwhat it should be.\n\nReferences\n[1] C.-N.
