In Part I, linear and non-linear theories have been formulated, based on an\nassumption of the existence of a positive feedback of a self-induced developing system. It\nwas found in Part I that the linear theory, a kind of the 2D Rankine vortex, gives some\nunacceptable analytical solutions of hurricane development at the upper half of the\natmosphere, although these solutions are fairly reasonable at the lower atmosphere. In the\nnon-linear theory, the analytical solutions agree well in many respects with observations of\nhurricane development at the early stage. Particularly, the solutions of the non-linear theory\noffer some new insights, which cannot be obtained by the linear theory, such as the very fast\nincrease of tangential wind near the core region, the deep U-shape of geopotential penetrating\nnearly up to the tropopause, the cyclonic wind at the upper atmosphere where divergence\noccurs. However, this non-linear has a disturbing property: a discontinuity of tangential wind\nand geopotential with radius as hurricanes develop. In this paper, this discontinuity will be\nresolved satisfactorily without any significant influence on the results obtained in the\nnonlinear theory in Part I. In addition, the effect of friction will be also investigated in this\npaper, which has not been done in Part I so far.\n\n2\n\n\fAcknowledgment\n\nI would like to thank Dr. Dalin Zhang for his many helpful corrections. I am also grateful to\nMr. Wallace Hogsett and Emily Becker for their constructive comments. This research was\nsupported by Vietnam Education Foundation (VEF). Had it not been for their support, I\nwould not have been able to concentrate my mind on this work.\n\n3\n\n\f1. Introduction\nA completely analytical theory for hurricane phenomenon, so far, has not been\ndeveloped. Traditional theoretical approaches usually utilized some scaling numbers or\nincipient balanced relationships to study the hurricane development. For example, Sawyer\n(1947) and Yanai (1961) proposed an interesting theoretical idea for hurricane development,\nin which some initial equilibrium relationships between mass and wind fields were exploited\n(Palmen and Newton 1969, chapter 15). If this equilibrium is disturbed, tangential and radial\nwind will ensue. By following this route, Yanai has obtained a final equation which contains\nseveral stability coefficients. Because these coefficients have no explicit expression, no exact\nsolution was obtained thus far. In another fashion, Willoughby (1979) has made use of some\nscaling values, e.g. tangential wind V=50m/s, radial wind U=10m/s, etc., and expanded all\nfield variables as a series in terms of a nondimension number \u03b5 (\u03b5 \u2261U/V). By performing\nsome scaling and restricting the series to the first two approximations, a system of equations\nfor mean fields and another system for perturbations emerged. This theoretical idea has\nemployed implicitly a pre-existing hurricane and it was also impossible to find any analytical\nsolutions with this theory because of the high order and mixed derivatives of field variables.\nAnother example is the work of Montgomery and Farrell (1993) on tropical cyclone\nformation. In their work, a separation between geostrophic wind (vg) and ageostrophic winds\n(ua,w) was made to concentrate on the secondary circulation by ageostrophic winds. Some\nconclusions of the role of the upper level potential vorticity on the formation process of\ntropical cyclone were obtained but, once again, it is still impossible to come up with any\nexact solutions in their work. In recent decades, the most extensive approach to hurricane\nproblem is modeling, due to the rapid improvement of computer speed (Zhang et. al. 2000;\nChalla et. al. 1998; Nguyen et. al. 2001; Zhu et. al. 2001; to name only a few). By using\n\n4\n\n\fhurricane models, it is automatically impossible to find any information about the functional\nform of the solutions of the system of the primitive equations.\nIn Part I of this series of papers, two theories for the early stage of the development of\nhurricanes have been considered. One is a linear theory and the other is non-linear. In order\nto handle the problem analytically, it has been assumed that there exists a positive feedback\nprocess between latent heat and vertical motion in some region when (and where) a hurricane\nis expected to form. In the linear theory, all nonlinear terms are neglected and no friction\nincluded. The analytical solutions obtained from this theory have several fairly reasonable\nproperties, which agree with observations at the lower half of the atmosphere, such as the\ncorrect variation of tangential wind with radius, the cyclonic sense of wind, the U-shape of\ngeopotential (but shallower than observations (fig.2b and fig. 3 in Part I)), the increase of\ntangential and radial winds with time (which tell us about the growing of hurricanes as\nexpected). These solutions are somewhat the same as for the 2D Rankine vortex in fluid\nmechanics. However, at the upper half of the atmosphere, this linear theory immediately\ngives us some unobserved behaviors: motion will be anti-cyclonic, a high pressure system (a\nhill-shape of geopotential) will develop.\nTo surmount these shortcomings of the linear theory, a nonlinear theory is considered\n(but it still has no friction included). This non-linear theory captures all the good points in the\nlinear theory mentioned above (as it must). In addition, this theory offers some new\nproperties. First, the tangential wind in the region where the positive feedback is effective\nwill no longer increase as an exponential of time. Instead, it increases much stronger, as an\nexponential function of exponential of time (exp(ekt)), which is much faster than the radial\nwind or the tangential wind outside this feedback region. This may help us explain why\nhurricanes have an eye formed in this region at later time (it does not mean that hurricanes\n\n5\n\n\fhave an eye at the early stage. It just means that hurricanes tend to form an eye). Second, this\nnonlinear theory gives us a correct variation of tangential wind with height as observed.\nFinally, this theory is also able to explain a potentially deeper U-shape of geopotential as\nwell as the cyclonic motion even when there is a divergence in the upper half of the\natmosphere, which was not obtained by the linear theory. The weakness of this non-linear\ntheory is that tangential wind and geopotential are no longer a continuous function with\nradius as hurricanes develop. Another weakness, as in the linear theory, is the endlessly\nincrease of solutions with time. This is because, so far, there is no mechanism to control the\nenergy released in these theories. Both of these theories are expected to be correct up to first\n6-12h of the growing of hurricanes. Beyond this period, they will give inaccurate\ndescriptions.\nThe purpose of this paper will consist of:\n1. Eliminate the discontinuity in the non-linear theory.\n2. Include the effects of friction to the non-linear theory\nThis paper has five sections. Section 2 contains an improvement of the nonlinear theory in\nPart I so that tangential wind and geopotential will vary continuously with radius. Section 3\npresents a nonlinear theory in which friction will be included. So far, this friction has been\nneglected in both theories in Part I. Section 4 will mention some unresolved questions.\nDiscussions and conclusion will be given in the final section.\n\n6\n\n\f2. A continuous nonlinear theory for the early stage of hurricane\ndevelopment\nBecause of the remarkable results obtained from the non-linear theory in Part I by\nusing an assumption of a positive feedback process within a region of radius a, this\nassumption will be made again. According to this assumption, every time hurricanes tend to\nbe formed in some region, it is reasonable to assume that there is a proportional relationship\nbetween latent heat release (J) and vertical motion (w), given by: J=kw. More explanations\nabout this proportionality are given in Part I and will not be mentioned here again. However,\nunlike the top-hat function of positive feedback process as in Part I, our purpose now is to\nfind a new smooth function for the positive feedback process. Recall that, in Part I, vertical\nmotion is assumed to be different from zero within a region of radius a and to be zero outside\nthis region. Accordingly, the positive feedback process will vary with radius in the same way\nas the vertical motion. The natural generalization of a top-hat function is the Gaussdistribution function. This Gauss function appears frequently in many physical applications\nand it seems to be a good candidate for any \"pulse\" phenomenon. A hurricane can be\nregarded as a source point of some meteorological quantities, e.g. temperature or vertical\nmotion, in some small scale region. These quantities then decrease very fast outward. The\nsuccesses of the top-hat function of vertical motion in the non-linear theory in Part I suggest\nan attempt of using this Gauss function for the vertical motion to overcome the discontinuity.\nFor the sake of completeness, all assumptions in the nonlinear theory in Part I are\nrewritten here. More complete explanations can be found in sections 3.1 and 3.2 in Part I.\n-\n\nNon-linear terms in the tangential and radial momentum equations are included, but\nnon-linear terms in vertical and thermodynamic equations are neglected.\n\n-\n\nNo friction is considered\n\n7\n\n\f-\n\nIncompressible fluid d\u03c1/dt=0\n\n-\n\nBoussisnesq approximation\n\n-\n\nThere exist a region in which vertical velocity (w) is related to heating source (J) by a\npositive feedback relationship (J=kw). Vertical velocity will have a prescribed Gauss\nprofile with radius.\n\n-\n\nF-plane\n\n-\n\nHurricanes are axis-symmetric\n\nWe first start with the system of the primitive equations in the cylindrical coordinate:\n\u2202u\n\u2202u\n\u2202u v 2\n\u2202\u03c6\n+u\n+w \u2212\n=\u2212\n+ fv\n\u2202t\n\u2202r\n\u2202z r\n\u2202r\n\n(1.1)\n\n\u2202v\n\u2202v\n\u2202v uv\n+u +w +\n= \u2212 fu\n\u2202t\n\u2202r\n\u2202z r\n\n(1.2)\n\n\u2202w\n=b\n\u2202t\n\n(1.3)\n\n\u2202w\n1 \u2202\n(ru ) +\n=0\nr \u2202r\n\u2202z\n\n(1.4)\n\n\u2202b\n= \u03b2 2w\n\u2202t\n\n(1.5)\n\nWhere the symmetry of hurricanes with the azimuthal angle has been used. (u,v,w) are the\ncomponents of wind field in the radial, tangential and vertical directions, respectively. f is\nCoriolis parameter, r is radius. b here is the new quantity representing the buoyancy (b=(TTe)/Te where Te is the temperature of environment.) and \u03b22 = k/Cp-N2 (N2 as usual is the\nbuoyancy frequency and the relation J/Cp = kw has been used in equation (1.5), see Part I for\ndetailed)\nCombine (1.3) and (1.4), the solution for w is then given by:\nw = W1 (r , z )e \u03b2 .t + W2 (r , z )\n8\n\n(1.6)\n\n\fAs in Part I, it is reasonable to consider the function W1(r,z) as a separable function of radius\nand height W1(r,z)=H(z)R(r). The reason for this separable function is that vertical motion is\nalways equal to zero at both the lower surface and the tropopause. Therefore, the dependence\nof vertical motion with height can be approximated to be the same everywhere. In Part I, the\nfunction H(z) is chosen as: H(z)=W0sin(\u03bbz), where \u03bb is inversely proportional to the standard\nscale height H0 (H0 \u224810km) so that the vertical velocity is equal to zero at z=0 and z=H0 (see\nPart I for the explanations of this choice). Also, as in Part I, W2(r,z) will be neglected. This\nneglecting means that all vertical motions within the region of radius a is assumed to\noriginate from the positive feedback process. As mentioned above, in order to remove the\ndiscontinuity of tangential wind and geopotential with radius, it is necessary to replace the\ntop-hat function of R(r) in Part I (R(r) = 0 for r<a and zero otherwise) by the Gaussdistribution function: R(r) = e\n\n\u2212\n\nr2\na2\n\n. Therefore, the final solution for the vertical velocity will\n\nbecome:\nw = H ( z )e\n\n\u2212\n\nr2\na2\n\ne \u03b2 .t\n\n(1.6')\n\nIt should be remembered that there now no longer have two regions I and II as in the\nnonlinear theory in Part I since the top-hat function for R(r) has been replaced by the Gauss\nfunction. It is therefore unnecessary to solve the system ((1.1) to (1.5)) separately as in Part I.\nPlugging (1.6') into (1.4) to obtain an equation for radial wind:\nr2\n\n\u2202w\ndH \u2212 a 2 \u03b2 .t\n1 \u2202\n(ru ) = \u2212\n=\u2212\ne e\nr \u2202r\n\u2202z\ndz\n\n(1.7)\n\nIntegrate both sides of (1.7) with respect to radius, it is immediate to have the expression for\nradial wind as:\nr2\n\n1\ndH a 2 \u2212 a 2 \u03b2 .t\nu=(\ne e + C)\nr\ndz 2\n9\n\n(1.8)\n\n\fAt r=0, since radial wind must be zero, the constant C must be: C= \u2212\n\ndH a 2 \u03b2 .t\ne . The final\ndz 2\n\nsolution for the radial wind is:\n\u2212r 2\n\n1\ndH a 2 \u03b2 .t a 2\nu=\ne (e \u2212 1)\nr\ndz 2\n\n(1.9)\n\nIt is not difficult to check that the radial wind will increase linearly with radius for the small\nradius and will decrease as a function of inverse radius for the large radius. This behavior of\nthe radial wind is consistent with that in the nonlinear theory in Part I. This is not surprising\nsince Gauss function, in some way, is a smooth function of the top-hat function. Therefore, it\nis necessary for the radial wind to have behaviors consistent with those in Part I as the radius\napproaches the extreme values. The advantage of this Gauss function over top-hat function\nfor vertical velocity is now clear: the radial wind is automatically continuous without using\nany continuous condition at the radius r = a as in the nonlinear theory in Part I. It is expected\nthat this advantage will be also applied for tangential wind and geoptential. Substitute (1.6)\nand (1.9) into (1.2) to obtain an equation for tangential wind:\n\u2212\n\nr2\n\n\u2212\n\nr2\n\nr2\n\n\u2212\n\nr2\n\n\u2212 2 \u2202v\n\u2202v\n(e a \u2212 1) \u2202v\n(e a \u2212 1) v\n(e a \u2212 1)\n+ Me \u03b2 .t\n+ He \u03b2 .t e a\n+ Me \u03b2 .t\n= \u2212 fMe \u03b2 .t\nr\nr\nr\nr\n\u2202t\n\u2202r\n\u2202z\n\nWhere M =\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n(1.10)\n\ndH a 2\n. Equation (1.10) is a very complicated PDE, which is hard to solve for\ndz 2\n\nexactly. From the results in the nonlinear theory in Part I, we know that both radial and\ntangential wind have the same dependence on radius. Therefore, it is suggestive to seek a\nsolution for the tangential wind in the same form as the radial wind solution (1.9) (Because\nthe Gauss-distribution function is a kind of generalization of the top-hat function). We thus\nfind the solution of tangential wind in the form:\n\n10\n\n\f\u2212r 2\n\nv = g (r , z , t )(e a \u2212 1)\n2\n\n1\nr\n\n(1.11)\n\nWhere the function g(r,z,t) is still a function of r. At the large and small radius, g(r,z,t) is\nexpected to be a function of (z,t) only so that solution (1.11) will have the same asymptotic\nforms as those in the non-linear theory in Part I. If this is the case, it is easy to verify that the\ntangential wind will have the correct expressions as in Part I when the radius approaches the\nvery large and small values: tangential wind will increase linearly with radius for the small\nvalue of r and decrease as a function of inverse radius for the large value of r.

Apparently, both\nsolutions at the large radius are completely the same, which assures that all of the results in\nthe nonlinear theory in Part I can be applied equally well at the large radius. We expect this\nconsistency because the solutions obtained in the nonlinear theory in Part I have been\nverified with observations. Therefore, any modification in this section, at first, must preserve\nall the good points that the nonlinear theory in Part I has obtained and the solution (1.17) is\nperfectly what we are looking for at the large radius.\nAt the small radius\nUsing approximation: exp(-(r/a)2) \u2248 1-(r/a)2, equation (1.14) becomes:\n\u2202g\n2(a 2 \u2212 r 2 )\nr 2 \u2202g\n\u03b2 .t\n2 \u2202g\n\u03b2 .t\n+ Me (\u2212\ng \u2212 a r ) + He (1 \u2212 2 )\n= \u2212 fMe \u03b2 .t (1.18)\n4\n\u2202t\n\u2202r\na\na \u2202z\nKeep only terms in (1.18) up to the first order in radius, (1.18) becomes:\n\u2202g\n2\n\u2202g\n\u2202g\n+ Me \u03b2 .t (\u2212 2 g \u2212 a 2 r ) + He \u03b2 .t\n= \u2212 fMe \u03b2 .t\n\u2202t\n\u2202r\n\u2202z\na\n\n(1.19)\n\nThis equation should be compared with equation (2.12) in Part I. Instead of solving this\nequation directly, it is sufficient to verify that the solution (2.23) in Part I:\n12\n\n\fv r .small = {G0\n\nsin(\u03bbz )\ntan(\n\n\u03bbz\n2\n\n1\n\nepx(e \u03b2 .t ) + D sin(\u03bbz ) \u2212\n\n) W0 \u03b2\u03bb\n\nf\n}r\n2\n\n(1.20)\n\nis indeed a particular solution of (1.19). This once again tells us that, at the small radius,\nequation (1.14) admits a solution which agrees with that in the nonlinear theory in Part I. In\norder to complete the treatment of the problem, it would be great if equation (1.14) can be\nsolved for all intermediate values of radius, admitting the solutions (1.17) and (1.20) as\nboundary conditions. However, it is very hard and, fortunately, not very necessary to do that\ntask. Recall that our purpose here is to find a modification such that all conclusions obtained\nin the nonlinear theory in Part I can be still valid while the discontinuity of tangential wind\nand geopotential with radius at the later time is removed. Obviously, this purpose is done.\nAlthough it is not possible to obtain any explicit solution at all values of radius for tangential\nwind (and consequently, geopotential), basically we have shown a way to get rid of the\ndiscontinuity. This is very important because, from now on, it is sufficient to use the top-hat\nfunction for vertical velocity to examine the properties of analytical solutions without any\nworry about the possible disturbing discontinuities. The reason why the top-hat function is\npreferred is because exact solutions can be found the most easily in this case. Whenever it is\nrequired to remove discontinuities, all we need to do is to replace the top-hat function by the\nGauss-distribution function and all conclusions are still preserved. It should be noted that\nequation (1.14) will contain many other possible solutions. However, by using the solutions\n(1.17) and (1.20) as boundary limitations, which are physically meaningful at the large and\nsmall radiuses, the continuous physical solution of (1.14) will be unique.\n\n13\n\n\f3. A nonlinear theory with friction included\nAll the theories for the early stage of hurricanes developed so far in this series of\npapers have no friction included. Actually, as explained in part I, the role of friction becomes\nmuch less significant in all of the above theories due to the assumption of the existence of a\npositive feedback between latent heat release and vertical motion. Usually, in a real\natmosphere, friction is believed to be the main mechanism for the convergence at low level.\nThis convergence is very important since it provides a source of latent heat for hurricanes.\nThe no-friction assumption may lead to some confusing and the role of friction, therefore, is\ndeserved to be discussed in more detail before we delve into this section.\nNormally, the discussions of friction and convergence are mentioned together (and\nblended into one another). The common thinking about the effect of friction in hurricane\ndevelopment is as follows: Friction will slow down tangential wind and annihilate the\nbalanced tangential wind. So, there will appear an inward component of radial wind and,\nbecause of the conservation of angular momentum (this is not really true due to the presence\nof friction), the inward wind will lead to a strong increase of tangential wind. Also, the\nconvergence toward low center will create an upward motion and provide more moisture to\nthe upper levels. These arguments have an origin from the Ekman convergence problem (e.g.\nHolton 1993). Therefore, an assumption of no friction may lead to a quick conclusion that\nthere is no convergence and hurricanes cannot exist. However, it turns out that the always\nside-by-side appearance of friction and convergence conceals another kind of convergence. It\nis convenient to divide the convergence in hurricanes imaginarily into two kinds. The first is\nthe friction convergence mentioned above. The second kind of convergence is related to a\npositive feedback process between vertical motion and latent heat and has no relation to\nfriction. The meaning of this feedback convergence is as follows: Suppose now that a\n\n14\n\n\fpositive feedback is triggered at the middle level of the atmosphere, then both temperature\nand vertical velocity will increase at this level. Because of the impenetrable surface boundary\nand the stable troposphere, the vertical velocity will be forced to be zero at the surface and\ntropopause. Since vertical velocity is a continuous function of height, there will have a\nconvergence of wind below (vertical velocity increases with height) and divergence above\n(vertical velocity decreases with height). This strong convergence (divergence) leads to a\nlarger inward (outward) acceleration of radial wind below (above) and so on. An equivalent\nview is that a warm core in the feedback region will lead to an expanding column and will\nlower the surface pressure. A low pressure system will develop and more convergence will\noccur. Friction plays no role in this feedback process.\nIn all of the theories for the early stage of hurricane development so far, much of the\nconcentration is on the convergence due to the positive feedback process. Friction\nconvergence has been totally neglected. Basically, these theories support the development of\nhurricanes in which the role of friction is minor. No friction does not mean that there is no\nconvergence. If there is no feedback mechanism, friction alone will spin down a vortex\ninstead of strengthening it. When a positive feedback appears, the roles of this feedback in\ncontrolling the convergence will dominate those of friction. Hurricanes, as a whole, are\ngoverned by the convergence from the feedback process rather than by the friction\nconvergence. To investigate the role of friction, the nonlinear theory in Part I will be\nexpanded in this section in which friction will be included. It should be careful that all of the\nvariables in the system of the primitive equations are not averaged in any way and, therefore,\nthere is no room for the concept of eddy flux terms in any discussion here (see Part I for the\ndetailed explanations of the role of eddy terms in the primitive equations).\n\n15\n\n\fBecause it is now known from section 2 that the assumption of the top-hat function\nfor the vertical velocity is not a serious shortcoming (though this function will lead to a\ndiscontinuity of tangential wind and geopotential), we will use again this top-hat function for\nvertical motion so that the exact solutions of the system of the primitive equations can be\nfound the most easily. Any discontinuity will be eliminated simply by replacing the top-hat\nfunction by the Gauss-distribution function and every conclusions obtained in this section are\nstill valid. All of the starting assumptions in this section will be the same as those in the\nnonlinear theory in Part I. However, the no-friction assumption, which has been used in Part\nI, will now be removed.

Note that\nthese friction terms represent only the molecular viscosity because all field variables (u, v, w,\netc.) are not subject to the Reynolds average and, therefore, no eddy concept will appear.\nFollowing exactly what have been done in Part I, the solutions for the vertical and radial\nvelocity in regions I and II will be given by:\n\n16\n\n\fyxzH\nw1 (r , z , t ) = H ( z )e \u03b2 .t in region I and w2 (r , z , t ) = 0 in region II\n\n(2.6)\n\nu1 = \u2212\n\ndH \u03b2 .t r\ne\n\u2261 Qe \u03b2 .t r\ndz\n2\n\n(2.7)\n\nu2 = \u2212\n\n1 dH \u03b2 .t a 2\nQ\u2032\n\u2261 e \u03b2 .t\ne\n2 dz\nr\nr\n\n(2.8)\n\nConsider first region I where the positive feedback mechanism is effective.\nRegion I\nSubstitute solutions (2.6) and (2.7) for the vertical and radial wind in region I into (2.2) to\nobtain an equation for the tangential wind:\n\u2202v1\n\u2202 2 v1\n\u03b2 .t \u2202v1\n\u03b2 .t \u2202v1\n\u03b2 .t v1\n\u03b2 .t\n+ Qe r\n+ He\n+ Qe r = \u2212Qrfe + \u03ba 2\nr\n\u2202t\n\u2202r\n\u2202z\n\u2202z\n\n(2.9)\n\nAs explained in Part I, it is reasonable to seek the solution v1 in this region in the form:\nv1=F(z,t)r.

So, from\ndefinition of Q, we have: Q = \u03bbW0cos(\u03bbz). Substitute these expressions for H and Q into\n(2.12):\n\u2202Fh\n\u2202 2 Fh\n\u2202F\n\u2212\u03ba\n= \u2212e \u03b2 .t (W0 sin(\u03bbz ) h \u2212 W0 \u03bb cos(\u03bbz ) Fh )\n2\n\u2202t\n\u2202z\n\u2202z\n\n(2.13)\n\nThe problem now becomes much more complicated because of the appearance of the friction\nterms, although this term is very small (molecular viscosity coefficient \u03ba is usually very\nsmall). There no longer exists solutions of the form Fh=Cexp(e\u03b2t) as in the no-friction theory\nin Part I. Indeed, it is not hard to prove that, if \u03ba is a constant, the only separable solution that\n2\n\nwe can get from (2.13) will have a form: Fh = D sin(\u03bbz )e \u2212\u03ba\u03bb t , which will decrease with time\nand it is not the solution that we are expecting for a developing system. The expected\nsolution of (2.13) must be not only a growing solution abut also a continuous function of \u03ba\nsuch that, when the viscosity coefficient is equal to zero, this solution needs to approach the\nsolution obtained in the no-friction nonlinear theory in Part I. Equation (2.13) illustrates very\nclearly how much a small quantity when added can effect to the final exact solution.\nNormally, the scaling evaluation is used and one simply ignores a small molecular frictional\nterm. This small term may have a small effect to the numerical calculation but it can change\nsubstantially the functional form of the exact solution. Sometimes, this small adding term\nwill create a bifurcation point and exact solutions may behave totally different.\nConsequently, the values obtained from numerical calculation needs to have a very special\nattention.\nHowever, if all field variables are not Reynolds averaged as stated above, this\nviscosity coefficient \u03ba will be very small and it represents just a molecular friction. In order\n\n18\n\n\fto have a more meaningful effect of friction, it is necessary to apply the Reynolds-averaging\noperator to transform the true variables to Reynolds-averaged variables so that friction will\nrepresent eddy processes. The system of the primitive equations does not change under this\naveraging process except there appear some eddy terms (see e.g. Holton 1993, chapter 5). We\nwill always understand that if friction terms represent eddy processes, all variables are\nReynolds averaged. In this case, the appearance of eddy processes will make problem\nbecome extremely complicated since it is impossible to know a true parameterization for the\nsmall-scale processes. For the purpose of theoretically investigating, it is desired to use some\ntentative functional forms for the eddy terms to study the characteristics of the exact\nsolutions. Consider now the case in which the eddy coefficient \u03ba is a function of time as\nfollows: \u03ba=\u03ba0exp(\u03b2t). The motivation for this choice comes from the observations and\nprevious works that the eddy coefficient is a function of wind speed. If a hurricane is\ngrowing, wind speed will increase with time and, therefore, this eddy coefficient \u03ba will\ndepend on time. This time dependence may be not the actual case but, at least, it provides us\nsome insights into the effect of friction and makes problem solvable. With this assumption,\n(2.13) now becomes:\n\u2202Fm\n\u2202 2 Fm\n\u2202F\n\u2212 \u03ba 0 e \u03b2 .t\n= \u2212e \u03b2 .t (W0 sin(\u03bbz ) m \u2212 W0 \u03bb cos(\u03bbz ) Fm )\n2\n\u2202t\n\u2202z\n\u2202z\nBecause the RHS of (2.14) is a function of the form: ( H\n\n(2.14)\n\n\u2202Fm dH\n\u2212\nFm ) , it may be tempted\n\u2202z\ndz\n\nto find a solution of (2.14) in the form: Fm = HG (t ) = sin(\u03bbz )G (t ) . However, after plugging\nthis solution into (2.14) and doing some simplifications, it will be easy to find that the final\nsolution will decrease with time and it is not what we expect for hurricane development. A\n\n19\n\n\fquick inspection will tell us that a growing solution of (2.14) can be found in the form:\n\nFm = exp(e \u03b2 .t )G ( z ) .

The only change compared with the case of no friction in\nPart I is that the vertical profile of wind will be modified.

Unlike in region I, it is now possible to find the\nanalytical solution of (2.21) even in the case the viscosity coefficient \u03ba is a constant.\nConsider a particular solution of (2.21) in the form: G = e\u03b2tZ(z) and plug into (2.22):\n\n\u03b2e \u03b2 .t Z = \u2212 fQ \u2032e \u03b2 .t + \u03bae \u03b2 .t\n\nd 2Z\ndz 2\n\n(2.22)\n\nor\n\n\u2212\u03ba\n\nd 2Z\n1\n+ \u03b2 Z = fW0 a 2 \u03bb cos(\u03bbz )\n2\n2\ndz\n\n(2.23)\n\nFrom (2.23), it is simple to get the solution for Z as:\nZ=\n\nfW0 a 2 \u03bb\ncos(\u03bbz )\n2(\u03ba\u03bb2 + \u03b2 )\n\n(2.24)\n\nThis is not the final solution for (2.21) yet because we have to consider one more thing: the\nhomogeneous solutions of equation (2.21). It is easy now to find that there are an infinitive\nnumber of homogeneous solutions. These homogeneous solutions can be divided into three\nfamilies, based on their time dependence: a family of time-decreasing solutions, a constant\nvalue and a family of time-increasing solutions. The final homogeneous solution requires a\nsuperposition of all of these families. This superposition leads to an infinitive solution, which\n\n21\n\n\fis not acceptable for realistic cases. To get rid of this difficulty, we need to use a condition\nwhich has not been used before: a continuous dependence of the solution of equation (2.21)\non \u03ba. It means that when \u03ba approaches zero, the solution of (2.21) must be identical with that\nobtained in the no-friction nonlinear theory in Part I (solution with \u03ba=0). Using this\ncondition, the only acceptable homogeneous solution of (2.21) is a constant value. Therefore,\nthe final solution for the tangential wind in the region II is:\nv 2 = ( Ze \u03b2 .t + Z h )\n\nfW0 a 2 \u03bb\n1\n1\ncos(\u03bbz )e \u03b2 .t + C )\n=(\n2\nr\nr\n2(\u03ba\u03bb + \u03b2 )\n\n(2.25)\n\nCompare this solution with (2.33) in the nonlinear theory in Part I, it is immediate to realize\nthat if \u03ba is equal to zero, the solution for the tangential wind in region II given by (2.25) is\nconsistent with that obtained from the no-friction nonlinear theory in Part I. For the case in\nwhich \u03ba is a constant, friction will represent the molecular viscosity only and \u03ba is very\nsmall . Therefore, the difference between solution (2.25) and the solution obtained in Part I\nwill be insignificant.\nThe effect of friction is the most effective only if the Reynolds-averaged variables are\nconsidered as mentioned in few paragraphs above. Consider now a situation in which the\neddy coefficient \u03ba will change with time as: \u03ba=\u03ba0exp(\u03b2t) as investigated in region I. In this\ncase, it is not difficult to realize that the solution of (2.21) will have a form: G=T(t)cos(\u03bbz).\nSubstitute this solution into (2.21) we have:\ncos(\u03bbz )\n\ndT 1\n= \u03bbW0 f cos(\u03bbz )a 2 e \u03b2 .t \u2212 \u03ba 0 e \u03b2 .t T\u03bb2 cos(\u03bbz )\ndt 2\n\n(2.26)\n\nBecause (2.21) has to be valid at all time and level, it must follow that:\ndT 1\n= \u03bbW0 fa 2 e \u03b2 .t \u2212 \u03ba 0T\u03bb2 e \u03b2 .t\ndt 2\n\n22\n\n(2.27)\n\n\f\u03ba 0 \u03bb2 \u03b2 .t\ne ) , the solution of (2.27)\nSince the homogeneous solution of (2.27) is: Th = epx(\u2212\n\u03b2\n\u03ba 0 \u03bb2 \u03b2 .t\nwill have the form T = X (t )epx(\u2212\ne ) . A simple substitution and integration will give\n\u03b2\nus the functional form of X(t):\nX (t ) =\n\n\u03bbWo fa 2\n2\n\n\u03ba 0 \u03bb2 \u03b2 . y\n\u222ba epx(\u03b2y + \u03b2 e )dy\nt\n\n(2.28)\n\nUsing the continuous dependence of solution of (2.21) on \u03ba as explained above, the only\nacceptable homogeneous solution of (2.21) is a constant. Finally, the complete solution for\ntangential wind in region II will be given by:\n\n\u03bbWo fa 2 cos(\u03bbz )epx(\u2212\nv2 = {\n\n\u03ba 0 \u03bb2 \u03b2 .t\ne )\n\u03b2\n\n2\n\n\u03ba 0 \u03bb2 \u03b2 . y\n1\n\u222b\u03b6 epx(\u03b2y + \u03b2 e )dy + C} r\nt\n\n(2.29)\n\nwhere \u03b6 is a constant of integration. A quick inspection will show that, if \u03ba0 is equal to zero,\n(2.29) is indeed consistent with solution (2.33) in the no-friction nonlinear theory in Part I.\nOnce again, we found that the tangential wind in region II increases approximately as an\nexponential function of time, which is much slower than tangential wind in region I (Note\nthat there is a substantial cancellation of time-dependent terms in (2.29)). This result is also\nobtained in the no-friction nonlinear theory in Part I.\nThe final task of finding geopotential for each region is nothing special and will not\nbe mentioned here. The appearance of the friction terms does not change much the\nconclusions about geopotential obtained in Part I except some minor modifications, e.g. the\nsolution for geopotential in region I now becomes:\n\n\u03c61 = \u03a6 o \u2212 ( \u03b2 e \u03b2 .t Q + e 2 \u03b2 .t Q 2 + He 2 \u03b2 .t\n\ndQ\nd 2 Q \u03b2 .t r 2\n\u2212 K 2 \u2212 fKr \u2212 \u03ba\ne )\n2\ndz\ndz 2\n\n23\n\n(2.30)\n\n\f\u03b2 .t\nWhere K= {C exp(e )\n\nf\n}G ( z ) (This expression for K is applied only to the case in which\n2\n\nall variables are Reynolds-averaged and eddy coefficient \u03ba is given by \u03ba=\u03ba0exp(\u03b2t)). It is not\npossible to have an exact solution the analytical solution of tangential wind in region I\nbecause function G(z) is unknown. However, it is reasonable to have all conclusions about\nthe behaviors of geopotential in region I as obtained so far in Part I. This is because friction\ncontributes only: 1) a term which increases as an exponential function of time (the last term\ninside the bracket in the RHS of (2.30)), which increase much slower than the K-terms and 2)\nchanging the functional form of height dependence (the unknown function G(z)). Therefore,\nthe K-terms in the RHS of (2.30) are still an exponential function of exponential of time and\nwill be the dominated terms at later time. The conclusions for the geopotential field in region\nII obtained in the no-friction nonlinear theory in Part I are also valid here.\n\n24\n\n\f4. Unresolved problems\nAt this point, it can be easily seen that all the theories developed so far in Part I and II\nstill have a very disturbing result: a nonstop growing of all variables. This is because we have\nused a positive feedback which is completely independent on any internal mechanism. A\nquestion is \"What prevent a hurricane from growing endlessly while it has an unlimited\nsource of moisture at the ocean surface?\" Several reasons can be listed, such as the latent\nheat release will raise the temperature of environment in (the)region I so that the buoyancy\nforcing will reach an asymptotic value instead of increasing exponentially with time (\u03b22 is a\nfunction of time, not a constant as assumed so far), the nonlinear dependence of friction on\nwind speed (which makes friction become important at later time and the energy lost due to\nfriction can not be simply neglected). Until now, none of these damping effects was\nconsidered. The results in this work, as mentioned in Part I, should be confined to the first 612 hours of hurricane lifetime. Beyond this period, all solutions will be inaccurate.\nIn section 3, there are some investigations into the role of friction at the early stage of\nhurricane development, which was ignored in Part I. It was commented that there are\nbasically two kinds of convergence: one is due to friction and the other is due to a feedback\nprocess between latent heat release and vertical motion. According to the theories developed\nso far in Part I and II, the role of the feedback process in controlling the convergence is so\ninfluent that friction, when included, does not change significantly all the conclusions\nobtained in the no-friction theory in Part I as seen in section 3. It is worthy now to have some\nmore explanations about this separation between two kinds of convergence. In an axissymmetric hurricane, the variation of tangential wind with the azimuthal angle, \u2202v/\u2202\u03bb, is\nalways assured to be zero and all of the convergence/divergence will be decided only by the\nvertical and radial motions. In the presence of friction, tangential wind will be slowed down\n\n25\n\n\f(but the axis-symmetry still guarantees that \u2202v/\u2202\u03bb=0) and there will appear an inward\nacceleration of radial wind. This acceleration creates a convergence at low level and,\nconsequently, vertical motion will follow. In a typical atmosphere, such friction-induced\nsecondary circulation will spin down a vortex (Holton, 1993). However, in hurricane\nconditions, such a circulation may create an unknown feedback and, so far, this friction\nfeedback has not been included. Note that this friction feedback is different from the\nfeedback employed in this series of papers, which is a relationship between vertical motion\nand latent heat. There appears now a difficult question: \"how can we distinguish between\nthese feedbacks clearly\". Actually, this work has answered partly this question by pointed out\nthat, under only the assumption of the feedback between latent heat and vertical motion, the\ndynamical properties of hurricanes have been captured well. This fact shows implicitly that\nthe feedback between vertical motion and latent heat is dominant. It should be mentioned\nthat, though friction was included in section 3, the feedback is still between latent heat and\nvertical motion only and the role of friction feedback is still open.\nAs in Part I, nothing is mentioned about the eye of hurricanes because all of our\nconcentration is just on the early stage of hurricane development. However, with the explicit\nsolutions obtained in the nonlinear theory in Part I and this paper, we can say something\nabout the appearance of an eye of a hurricane. It is possible to imagine this eye-forming\nprocess of a hurricane as follows: When a positive feedback is effective within some region,\nvertical wind will increase as an exponential function of time in this region. This strong\nvertical motion, or equivalently the strong vertical advection, will generate a large source\nterm in the tangential wind equation. As a consequent, the tangential wind in this region will\nincrease very fast with time and create a parabolic shape of geopotential (in the same way as\nwe stir robustly a water surface in a glass). Here, we have a situation: wind field decides the\n\n26\n\n\fshape of geopotential rather than inversely. (This is reasonable since, at small scale, the\natmosphere tends to have mass field adjusted to wind field rather than inversely). As time\npasses, this geopotential surface is lower and lower and an eye tends to form at later time.\nHowever, this picture is still far from observations since vertical velocity, according to the\ntheories in Part I and II, increases exponentially everywhere inside region I, which is not\nrealistic as observed. However, at least, the theories developed in Part I and this paper\nprovide a good picture of hurricane dynamics at the early stage of hurricane lifetime.\n\n27\n\n\f5. Discussion and conclusion\nIn this second part, my first purpose is to remove the discontinuity of the tangential\nwind and geopotential with radius, which appears in the analytical solutions for the early\ndeveloping stage of a hurricane obtained in the non-linear theory in Part I. By replacing the\ntop-hat function by the Gauss-distribution function for vertical velocity, it is then found that\nthe discontinuity has been eliminated satisfactorily without changing all conclusions obtained\nin the nonlinear theory in Part I. Although it has not been possible to find all solutions\ncompletely explicitly in the case of using the Gauss-distribution function, this improvement\nis helpful because it allows us to continue using the top-hat function for vertical velocity\nwithout any worry about the appearance of discontinuity. The reason we need to use the tophat function for investigation is because this is the case in which the analytical solutions of\nthe primitive equations can be found the most easily.\nIn section 3, the influences of friction were taken into account, which has been\nneglected in the nonlinear theory in Part I. If the primitive equations are not subject to\nReynolds-averaging process, then these frictional effects represent just the molecular\nviscosity and, therefore, they are of no interest to us. In order to have a more significant\nmeaning of the influence of friction, all variables are then Reynolds averaged so that the\nfrictional terms will contain eddy processes. In this case, it was found that all conclusions\nobtained in the no-friction theory in Part I are still valid. The influences of friction are thus\nminor.\nIt is perhaps surprising that, by assuming just a positive feedback between vertical\nmotion and latent heat, it is then possible to find all solutions of the system of primitive\nequations explicitly as seen in Part I and II. As pointed out in Part I, this is because the\nsystem of the primitive equations has been divided into two closed subsystems: one for radial\n\n28\n\n\fand vertical velocities and the other for tangential wind and geopotential. Under the\nassumption of feedback process, it is then easy to obtain the explicit expression for vertical\nmotion with time. Using the continuity equation, we then found radial wind and then\ntangential wind and finally geopotential. A little scrutiny will show that, in this process of\nfinding solutions, the role of the feedback process is only apparent in determining the time\ndependence of vertical motion. If suppose now that, by some way, we have an explicit\nexpression for time dependence of the vertical motion, then it is completely unnecessary to\nemploy the feedback assumption and we are still able to have all solutions obtained so far.\nThere are two properties that make the primitive system becomes particularly solvable for\nhurricane phenomenon. The first property is the existence of the impenetrable surface and the\ntropopause. These boundaries specify an initial prescribed functional form for vertical motion\nsuch that the vertical velocity must be zero at these boundaries, regardless of type of motion.\nSeveral functional forms for the dependence of the vertical velocity on height can be used but\nthe final results would not be changed much because the primitive equations are the firstorder partial differential equations. These boundaries will give us an explicit function for the\nheight-dependent part of the vertical velocity in any situation. The second property is the\naxis-symmetry of hurricanes. These two properties make the system of the primitive\nequations become immediately analytically solvable when vertical velocity (or radial wind)\nis known a priori. It is possible to obtain all analytical solutions of the system of the primitive\nequations by applying only the two above properties without any aiding from the feedback\nassumption. To see this point clearly, let us consider the following arguments, which are\nbased entirely on these two above properties and also give us all solutions as in Part I and II:\n\n29\n\n\f\u2022\n\nFor the problem of investigating an initial stage of hurricane development, vertical\nvelocity is expected to be an increasing function of time. So, we can write\nw=T(t)Z(z)R(r), where T(t) is an increasing function of time, assumed to be T(t)= e\u03b2t\n\n\u2022\n\nBecause of the impenetrable boundaries, the functional form of Z can be chosen to be\nZ=sin(\u03bbz)\n\n\u2022\n\nAssume the vertical motion is large within a region of radius r=a and small outside,\n\u2212r 2\n2\n\nthen we can choose: R(r)= e a (or top-hat function)\nThe reason why a separable function for the vertical motion is chosen is because the heightdependence of vertical velocity can be regarded as the same everywhere (due to the firstorder derivative of the system of the primitive equations). With these three simple arguments,\nwe have showed that, basically, it is possible to have an initialization for the development of\na vortex without any aid from the feedback assumption. Follow completely the same as in\nPart I, all the dynamical characteristics of hurricane development can be recovered. This is a\nremarkably simple route to find exact solutions for the primitive equations. This route is of\ncourse arbitrary but its simplicity is very amazing. If one attempts to find first tangential\nwind or geopotential and next vertical and radial wind, it will become a nearly impossible\ntask.\nThere now appear questions, such as: What is the meaning of the order of solving a\nsystem of equations? Can this order represent the true evolution of a hurricane or it just a\nmathematical trick? This question is actually not trivial. In the experiment with a water\nsurface, it is seen clearly that the pattern of the water surface is decided by the velocity field,\n(which is given by an equation: \u2202p/\u2202r = v2/r). But in a synoptic motion, this order is inverted\nas v2/r = \u2202p/\u2202r (note the order of writing this equation) and the meaning, obviously, is also\n\n30\n\n\fdifferent: the velocity field will be decided by the pressure field. The different way to solve a\nsystem of equations tells us a different process in nature.\n\n31\n\n\fReference\n\nChalla, M., R. L. Pfeffer,Q. Zhao, S. W.
