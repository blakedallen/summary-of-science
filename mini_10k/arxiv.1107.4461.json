Introduction\nIn the current structure of the Standard Model (SM), the conservations of baryon number\nB and lepton number L are automatic consequence of the gauge invariance and renormalizability. On the other hand, neutrino oscillation observations [1\u20133] manifest strong lepton\nflavor violation, and imply that the SM is not a fundamental particle theory and should be\nextended. In minimal supersymmetric (SUSY) extensions of the SM, a new multiplicative\nquantum number, R = (\u22121)2S+L+3B , is introduced in terms of B, L and the spin quantum\nnumber S, to distinguish the SM particles (R = +1) from their SUSY partners (R = \u22121).\nIn the most general supersymmetric potential, R-parity violating (RPV) interactions can\nbe included as\n1\n1\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\nWR/ p = \u01ebab \u03bbijk L\u0302ai L\u0302bj \u00cak + \u01ebab \u03bbijk L\u0302ai Q\u0302bj D\u0302k + \u01eb\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 \u03bbijk \u00dbi\u03b1 D\u0302j\u03b2 D\u0302k\u03b3 + \u01ebab \u03b4i \u03bci L\u0302ai \u01242b\n2\n2\n\n(1.1)\n\nwhere i,j,k=(1,2,3) are generation indices, a,b=(1,2) are SU(2) isospin indices, and \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3\nare SU(3) color indices. L\u0302 and Q\u0302 are the lepton and quark SU (2) doublet superfields, \u00ca,\n\u00db and D\u0302 denote the singlets, and \u0124 is the Higgs doublet. The bilinear terms L\u0302\u0124 mix the\nlepton and Higgs superfield with the Higgsino mass parameter \u03bc, and consequently generate\nmasses of neutrinos. All the trilinear terms, L\u0302L\u0302\u00ca, L\u0302Q\u0302D\u0302 and \u00db D\u0302D\u0302 with dimensionless R\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\nviolating Yukawa couplings \u03bb, \u03bb and \u03bb respectively, only violate either L- or B-symmetry\nalone. Constraints on RPV couplings obtained so far are well summarized in Ref. [4].\nAlong with introducing compatible description of neutrino oscillation in a natural way,\nthe most attracting phenomena of RPV is to allow single production of SUSY particles.\nContrary to the pair productions of SUSY particles in the R-conserved frame, the RPV\nresonance production at colliders would dramatically reduce the threshold of probing new\nphysics. There were studies of sneutrino resonance production and decay at next generation e+ e\u2212 linear colliders [5] and at hadron colliders by both theoretical discussion [6\u20138]\nand experimental measurements at the Tevatron [9, 10], via lepton flavor violating L\u0302L\u0302\u00ca\nand L\u0302Q\u0302D\u0302 interactions. For single squark production, stringently constrained by indirect\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n\flow energy nucleon experiments, the baryon number violating \u00db D\u0302 D\u0302 couplings are negli\u2032\u2032\ngibly small, for example \u03bb11k are less than 10\u22127 given by nucleon-antinucleon oscillation\nmeasurements, and thus mechanics of RPV squark resonance production at TeV hadron\ncolliders are highly suppressed. On the other hand, at the proposed Large Hadron electron\nCollider (LHeC) [11], which provides complement to the LHC by using the existing 7 TeV\nproton beam, single squark can be produced and detected via L\u0302Q\u0302D\u0302 couplings in the next\ngeneration of electron-proton e\u2212 p collision experiments. In this paper we investigate the\npotential of searching stop quark via e\u2212 + p \u2192 t\u0303\u22171 \u2192 \u03bc\u2212 + b\u0304 resonance process, which\nprovides a new prospect to probe the RPV lepton flavor violating interactions.\n\n2. Signal and Background at the LHeC\nUnder the single dominance hypothesis [4] that t\u03031 , the lighter mass eigenstate of the two\n\u2032\n\u2032\nstop quarks, is simply governed by L\u0302Q\u0302D\u0302 couplings \u03bb131 and \u03bb233 , the parton-level signal\n \u0304 2 ) \u2192 t\u0303\u2217 \u2192 \u03bc\u2212 (p3 ) + b\u0304(p4 ), depicted by the Feynman\nprocess can be denoted as e\u2212 (p1 ) + d(p\n1\ndiagram in FIG. 1.\n\n\u03bc-(p )\n\ne-(p )\n\n3\n\n1\n\n\u03bb'113\n\n~\nt\n\n\u03bb'233\n\nd(p )\n\nb(p )\n\n2\n\n4\n\nFigure 1: The parton-level Feynman diagram of RPV signal e\u2212 d \u0304 \u2192 \u03bc\u2212 b\u0304.\n\nThe amplitude of the signal process at parton-level can be written as\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0015\n\u2032\n1 \u2212 \u03b35\n\u2032\n1 \u2212 \u03b35\n\u2212i\nM = v\u0304(p2 ) \u03bb131\n* \u016b(p3 ) \u03bb233\nu(p1 ) *\nv(p4 )\n(2.1)\n2\n\u015d \u2212 M 2 + iM \u0393\n2\n\u221a\nwhere \u015d = M\u03bcb is the center-of-mass energy of the hard scattering and equivalent to the\nfinal state invariant mass.

Positron beam configurations are taken into account as comparisons with their charge-conjugated electron beams. The signal cross sections evaluated\nunder different beams as a function of stop quark mass are depicted in FIG. 2. The positron\nbeam options raise larger cross sections for the signal e+ + d \u2192 t\u03031 \u2192 \u03bc+ + b than those\nfor its charged-conjugated process in most mass region, simply because of large density of\nhigh energy valance d-quark in proton PDF. To have our discussion conservative, we take\n70 GeV electron beam as default except stating explicitly otherwise.\nTo simulate the kinematics of the RPV signal and SM predictions, the comphep [12]\nevent generator and cteq6l1 [13, 13] PDF are used. The reducible SM background in\nelectron beam configuration comes from e\u2212 + p \u2192 e\u2212 + b/b\u0304 \u2192 \u03bde + b/b\u0304 + W \u2212 , where the\non-shell W boson decays leptonically via \u03bc\u2212 \u03bd\u0304\u03bc channel. Since from experimental point of\nview, it is difficult to determine the original charge of quarks in reconstructed jets, both\nb and b\u0304-quark initial state contributions at parton-level should be taken into account as\nbackground to the muon and b-jet associated signal. However, a real (virtual) top-quark\ncould be produced via e\u2212 + b\u0304 \u2192 \u03bde + t\u0304(\u2217) , and enhance the cross section greatly in the\nb\u0304-quark channel against b-quark contribution, i.e. \u03c3\u0302(e\u2212 + b\u0304 \u2192 \u03bde + W \u2212 + b\u0304) is about\ntwo order greater in magnitude than \u03c3\u0302(e\u2212 + b \u2192 \u03bde + W \u2212 + b) in most kinematic region.\nTherefore, we only choose e\u2212 +p \u2192 \u03bde +W \u2212 + b\u0304 in electron beam and its charge conjugation\ne+ + p \u2192 \u03bd\u0304e + W + + b in positron beam configuration as dominant SM background to\ne\u00b1 + p \u2192 \u03bc\u00b1 + b/b\u0304 signal. In the numerical calculation we take me = 0.511 M eV , m\u03bc =\n105.658 M eV , mW = 80.365 GeV , mt = 173.5 GeV , mb = 4.65 GeV , \u0393ttotal = 2.0 GeV ,\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\n\f0\n\n101\nsignal(M=100GeV)\nsignal(M=200GeV)\n\n-1\n\n10\n\nsignal(M=300GeV)\n\nArbitrary unit\n\nbackground\n-2\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n-5\n\n10\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\nInvariant mass M\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n(GeV)\n\nb\n\nFigure 3: The invariant mass M\u03bcb distributions of background and signals with 70GeV electron\nbeam at the LHeC.\n\n0\n\n101\nsignal(M=100GeV)\nsignal(M=200GeV)\n\n-1\n\n10\n\nsignal(M=300GeV)\n\nArbitrary unit\n\nbackground\n-2\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n-5\n\n10\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\nTransverse momentum of b-quark pT (GeV)\n\nFigure 4: The b-quark transverse momentum distributions of background and signals with 70GeV\nelectron beam at the LHeC.\n\n\u03b1\u22121\new = 137.036, and set the factorization scales for signal and background processes as\n\u03bcf = M and \u03bcf = mt , respectively.\nIn SM background, the two neutrinos \u03bde and \u03bd\u03bc will escape detection, and result in sig/ T . The remaining muon and b-quark are relatively soft,\nnificant missing transverse energy E\nand would mimic the \u03bc + b signal. On the other hand, governed by RPV Yukawa couplings,\nthe outgoing muon and b-quark in signal are isotropic in the rest frame of stop quark, and\ntherefore the transverse momentum pT of the two final state particles are inclined to be as\nhard as taking half of the stop mass. Accordingly, the signal is characterized by isolated\nand high pT outgoing muon and b-jet, back-to-back in the transverse r \u2212 \u03c6 plane, without sensible missing transverse energy. In experimental point of view, these features will\nhelp to distinguish signal from background.

Event Selection and Discussion\nTaking advantage of distinction between the RPV SUSY and SM predictions on \u03bc + b + X\nfinal states, a strategy of event selection can be developed as\n\u2022 Kinematics cuts: for muon, p\u03bcT > 25GeV, |\u03b7\u03bc | <2.5; for b-jet, pbT > 25GeV, |\u03b7b | <3.5.\n\u2022 The open angle in transverse plane \u2206\u03c6\u03bcb > 2.94, in which the deviation from exact\nback-to-back of the muon and b-jet leaves room for the effect of initial state radiation\nand resummation in signal.\n/ T < 25 GeV, taking possible energy resolution\n\u2022 The missing transverse energy veto as E\ninto account.\n\u2022 The invariant mass M\u03bcb > 85 GeV. This loose mass cut is to have the most efficiency\nof 100GeV stop, assuming 3\u03c3 b-quark jet energy resolution below the resonance mass\npole, and the cut will not be shifted for other signal mass point to derive most\nconservative estimation.\n\u2022 A 60% b-tagging efficiency is assumed for b-jet identification in experiments.\nIf we assume the b-tagging efficiency is 100%, these criteria could suppress the SM\nbackground efficiently. Only about 5.85% \u03bde bW (\u03bc\u03bd\u03bc ) events will survive after taking above\nselection rules, which corresponds to a cross section of 9.65 f b. On the other hand, 86%\nsignal events survive the above selections at stop mass M = 100 GeV , and the efficiency\nof signal would rise with the increment of stop mass from 100 GeV to 300 GeV . Assuming\nthere is no apparent deviation from SM prediction of \u03bc + b final states, the 2\u03c3 exclusion\nS\n\u2264 2.0.

One can see\n\u22121\n\u2212\nthat with 1f b at 70 GeV e p collider, the RPV \u03bc + b resonance of stop quark can be\nexcluded up to about M \u2264 700 GeV with default RPV couplings.\n\u2032\n\u2032\nNew direct 2\u03c3 upper bounds on \u03bb233 at given \u03bb131 can be calculated as a function\nof stop mass, and are depicted at 70GeV electron beam case in FIG.7. More stringent\nconstraints on RPV couplings could be given at LHeC. For example, at energy scale about\n\u2032\n\u2032\n100 GeV , constraints as \u03bb131 = 0.005, \u03bb233 . 0.85 \u00d7 10\u22123 can be derived from exclusive\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u03bc + b resonance search, which improve the associated sensitivity on \u03bb131 \u00d7 \u03bb233 by nearly 4\norders compared to those given in Eq.(2.4) from low energy processes. Moreover, in high\nmass region up to 500GeV, it is likely that either the stop RPV \u03bc + b resonance could be\ndirectly detected, or L\u0302Q\u0302D\u0302 couplings would be constrained much more stringently at the\nLHeC than given by indirect low energy experiments.\nSome issues should be addressed here:\n\u2022 The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the potential of the LHeC experiments\nin probing RPV single squark resonance with even the most conservative estimations.\n\n\u20136\u2013\n\n\f0.45\nLHeC, 1.0fb\n\n-1\n\n0.40\n\n'\n131\n'\n\n0.35\n\n=0.03\n\n131\n\n=0.01\n\n233\n\n95% C.L\n\n'\n\n'\n131\n\n0.30\n\n=0.005\n\n0.25\n0.20\n0.15\n0.10\n0.05\n0.00\n0\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\nThe lighter stop t\n\n\u2032\n\n1\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\nmass M (GeV)\n\n\u2032\n\nFigure 7: The upper bounds on \u03bb233 at given \u03bb131 as functions of stop masses at 70GeV e\u2212 p\ncollider.\n\nThus, the event selection strategy developed above is practicable and moderate, which\nis far from strict enough to optimize the signal significance. The constraints on Rviolating L\u0302Q\u0302D\u0302 couplings derived are conservative and easy to achieve in experiment.\nFor example, more severe moun b-jet mass window cut or binned likelihood method\non M\u03bcb can be employed while searching signal in high mass region, which would\nsignificantly improve sensitivity for M > 500GeV easily.\n\u2022 The large signal cross section of positron configuration e+ p over electron beam e\u2212 p in\ndirect searching stop t\u03031 quark resonance, is simply due to the large density of valance\nd-quark in proton. On the other hand, electron beams will take advantage over\nmuch larger luminosity; moreover, the single sbottom quark b\u0303 resonance production\nand decay at the LHeC, i.e. e\u2212 + p \u2192 b\u0303 \u2192 \u03bc\u2212 + uk analogically could be dominant.\nTherefore, the electron beam configuration can provide excellent opportunity to probe\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u03bb113 and \u03bb2k3 interactions.\n\n4. Summary\nIn this paper, the possibility of probing lepton flavor changing RPV L\u0302Q\u0302D\u0302 interactions\nvia e + p \u2192 t\u0303 \u2192 \u03bc + b process at the LHeC collider is investigated. Under the single\ndominance hypothesis, the resonance of stop quark can be produced and dominantly decay\ninto muon and b-quark final states. An event selection strategy is developed to optimize\nthe sensitivity of signal over SM background. Taking advantage of the enhancement of the\ndirect resonance production of squark and the distinctive kinematics distributions between\nthe signal and SM predictions, we come to conclusions that if there is no apparent excess of\nSM predictions on \u03bc + b final states, the sensitivity of RPV interactions can be measured at\nan unprecedented level compared to all the knowledge derived from indirect measurements.\n\nAcknowledgments: This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.11075150, No.11025528, No.11005101) and the Specialized\n\n\u20137\u2013\n\n\fResearch Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education (No.20093402110030).\n\nReferences\n[1] Y.
