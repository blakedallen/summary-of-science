Due to quantization of\nthe transverse motion electrons can propagate only via\nallowed modes and the low-temperature linear-response\nconductance of the QPC shows a step-like dependence\non a gate voltage [1]. When a bias voltage Vsd is applied\nbetween the source and drain electrodes the integer steps\nin the differential conductance N \u00d7 2e2 /h are smoothed\nand gradually transformed into the half-integer plateaus\n(N \u2212 21 )\u00d72e2 /h, where N = 1, 2, 3, ... is a number of channels available for propagation [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].\nMany features of the linear and nonlinear response of the\nQPC are by now well understood. However, even after\n20 years that have passed since the discovery of the conductance quantization, some of important aspects of the\nQPC conductance are not resolved yet and are still under discussions. One of the prominent examples (apart\nfrom the famous \"0.7-anomaly\" [11]) is a so-called \"0.25feature\" in the non-equilibrium differential conductance\nwhose origin is under lively current debate [8, 9, 10].\nA theory of the non-equilibrium conductance of\nthe QPC predicting the above mentioned half-integer\nplateaus was developed by Glazman and Khaetskii [2].\nThe half-integer plateaus have subsequently been observed and thoughtfully studied by a number of groups\n[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. The theory of Glazman and Khaetskii [2] and a later more refined approach by Frost et\nal. [5] successfully describe the QPC conductance in the\nregime when the differential conductance Gd & 2e2 /h.\nHowever, for Gd . 2e2 /h instead of the expected plateau\nat (0.5)\u00d72e2/h practically all experiments show a plateau\nat (0.2 \u2212 0.3) \u00d7 2e2 /h (sometimes called as a \"0.25feature\") [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. It has been recently\nargued that the \"0.25-feature\" corresponds to the fully\nspin polarized current even at zero magnetic field [10].\nThis conclusion implies far reaching consequences for\n\nsemiconductor spintronics as it opens up exciting possibilities to generate spin polarized current simply by applying a source-bias voltage to the quantum wire. However, alternative explanations of the \"0.25-feature\" due\nto the self-consistent electrostatics and non-linear screening of the lowest spin-degenerate subband have been advocated by other groups [8, 9]. In particular, Kothari\net al. [9] demonstrated that the experimental data are\nwell-described by the analytical models of Frost et al. [5]\nwith phenomenologically introduced asymmetric voltage\ndrop between the source and the drain.\nA detailed understanding of the QPC conductance is\nof the prime importance because the QPC represents the\ncornerstone of mesoscopic physics, and the conductance\nquantization is a fundamental phenomenon of electron\ntransport in low-dimensional structures. The controversy concerning the origin of the \"0.25-feature\" outlines the need for microscopic modeling based on the\nself-consistent approaches to the electron interaction and\nnon-linear screening free from adjustable parameters. It\nshould be stressed that previous phenomenological approaches [2, 4, 5, 9], while providing an important insight\nfor interpretation of experiments, are not, however, able\nto uncover a microscopic origin of the observed feature.\nIn this paper we present a model within the selfconsistent Hartree approximation that allows us to describe the nonlinear screening and evolution of the conductance plateaus out of equilibrium and thus uncover\nunderlying microscopic origin of the observed features in\nthe differential conductance. To solve the Schr\u00f6dinger\nequation we employ a standard non-equilibrium Green's\nfunction (NEGF) formalism [12, 13]. We demonstrate\nthat for G . 2e2 /h the differential conductance exhibits \u223c (0.25 \u2212 0.3) \u00d7 2e2 /h plateau (as opposed to\nthe 0.5 \u00d7 2e2 /h plateau predicted by the noninteracting theories [2, 5]). We also find that in the regime of\nG & 2e2 /h the nonlinear screening causes the half-integer\nplateaus to bend upward as Vsd increases. Note that this\nbending can be clearly seen in all the reported experiments [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], but, surprisingly enough,\n\n\f2\nlead\n\nits presence passed without comments (except of a brief\ndiscussion in [4]). Our finding therefore strongly indicates that \"0.25-feature\" is not spin-related and is caused\nby the non-linear screening and related pinning of spindegenerate electrons in the QPC.\n\nconstriction\n\nlead\n\nb\n\ngates\n2DEG\n\n+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +\n\nGaAs\nMODEL\n\n(1)\n\nis the sum of the electrostatic confinement (including contributions from the top gates, the donor layer,\nand the Schottky barrier), the Hartree and the bias\npotentials (see [14] for details).

The integration is performed over the whole device area including the semi-infinite leads; e.g., the Coulomb interaction\nis included both in the leads and in the QPC regions.\nThe Fermi energies EF in the left (L) and right (R)\nleads are shifted by the applied source-drain voltage\nVsd , EFL = EFR + eVsd , while there is a linear ramp of\nVbias (r) over the device region [13] (we set EFR = 0).\nFor a finiteR bias the \u0002electric current is \u0003calculated as\ndE T (E) fLF D (E) \u2212 fRF D (E) , with T (E)\n[15] I = 2e\nh\nFD\nbeing the transmission coefficient and fL(R)\n(E) is the\nFermi-Dirac (FD) distribution in the left (right) leads.\nTo calculate T (E), the electron density and the local density of states (LDOS) we use the standard NEGF method\n[12, 13] (see Appensix for the details of our calculations).\nHaving calculated the current I we are in position to calculate the conductance G = I/Vsd and the differential\nconductance Gd = dI/dVsd . The latter we compute by\nincreasing the bias voltage slightly and calculating the\nderivative dI/dVsd numerically.\nTo outline the role of quantum-mechanical effects in\nthe electron-electron interaction in the QPC, we also consider the Thomas-Fermi (TF) approximation solving the\nstandard TF equation to find the effective TF potential\n[14] and calculating G and Gd for this potential using the\nNEGF. This approximation does not capture quantummechanical quantization of electron motion and, therefore, utilization of the TF approximation is conceptually\nequivalent to a one-electron noninteracting approach.\n\n1\n\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\nVsd (mV)\n\n3\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\nVsd (mV)\n\n3\n\n0\n\n1\nVsd (mV)\n\nFIG. 1: (a),(b) Conductance G of the QPC calculated within\nthe TF and Hartree approximations for different bias voltages Vsd .

The geometrical\nwidth and length of the constriction are respectively 60 nm\nand 400nm. Temperature T = 0.2 K.\n\n\f3\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nFigure 1(a),(b) shows the conductance G of the QPC\ncalculated within the TF and Hartree approximations for\ndifferent source-drain voltages Vsd . The parameters of\nthe QPC are indicated in Fig. 1 and are chosen close to\nthose typically used in experiments (Note that we performed calculations for shorter QPCs which show the\nsame behavior). For zero Vsd the conductance shows\nwell defined quantized plateaus for both TF and Hartree\napproaches. The latter, however, predicts broader transition regions between the plateaus. The reason is the\nenergy level pinning effect[14]. This is illustrated in Fig.\n1 (c), (d) that shows the resonant energy structure inside the QPC constriction (i.e. the position of the peak\nin the local density of states (LDOS) integrated over the\ngeometrical area of the QPC constriction). In the TF approach the resonant levels sweep past EF in a linear fashion. In contrast, the Hartree calculations show pinning of\nthe energy levels (corresponding to the one-dimensional\n(1D) subbands in the narrowest part of the constriction)\nto FF within the energy window \u00b12\u03c0kB T . Within this\nwindow the FD distribution 0 < f F D < 1, and thus the\nstates are only partially filled. This leads to metalliclike behavior when electrons can be easily rearranged to\nscreen the external electric field. (For influence of the\npinning effect on equilibrium transport in quantum dots\nsee [14]; see also [16] for the experimental studies of the\nenergy level pinning in the QPC in the magnetic field).\nOut of equilibrium, the energy window eVsd providing current carrying states increases as the source-drain\nvoltage grows, and the conductance plateaus become\nsmeared, see Fig. 1 (a), (b). The plateaus in the conductance G completely disappears when eVsd exceeds the 1D\nsubband energy separation inside the QPC constriction.\nAt the same time, half-integer plateaus (N \u2212 12 ) \u00d7 2e2 /h\nappear in the the differential conductance Gd , see Fig.\n1 (e), (f)). A comparison of the TF and Hartree results show two profound differences between the calculated Gd . First, the lowest Hartree plateau N = 1\n2\noccurs at GH\nd \u2248 0.25 \u2212 0.3 * 2e /h as opposed to the\nTF\n2\nGd = 0.5 \u00d7 2e /h plateau predicted by the TF calculations. Second, all TF plateaus are flat and rather\nindependent of Vsd , whereas all higher Hartree plateaus\nN \u2265 2 are bent upward as Vsd increases. Note that these\ntwo features of the calculated GH\nd are clearly seen in all\nreported experiments [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] (see Fig. 1\n(g) for a representative example).\nIn order to understand the origin of the above features of the QPC nonlinear conductance let us inspect\nthe LDOS inside the QPC region. Let us first concentrate at the first plateau in the differential conductance.\nFigures 2 (c), (e), (g) show the evolution of LDOS as\nVsd is increased calculated within the noninteracting TF\napproach. The enhanced LDOS in the constriction corre-\n\nFIG. 2: The charge density and the LDOS of the QPC calculated in the Thomas-Fermi and Hartree approximations (left\nand right panels respectively) for the first half-integer plateau\nfor different Vsd . The corresponding gate voltages Vg are\nmarked by arrows in Figs. 1(a),(b),(e),(f). The effective potential Eq. (1) is plotted by the dashed lines. Solid slanted\nlines denote the bias potential\nprofile Vbias\n\u02c6\n \u0303 . Insets show the\nFD\ncurrent profiles, T (E) fLF D (E) \u2212 fR\n(E) .\n\nsponds to the position of the bottom of the lowest propagating subband. In the TF approximation the effective\nconfinement potential is symmetrically distributed relative to Vbias (that ramps linearly along the device). Because of this the 1D subband touches Vbias at the QPC\ncenter (at the energy E = EFL \u2212 eV2sd ). As a result, the\nelectrons injected from the left lead in the upper half of\nthe eVsd window (EFL < E < EFL \u2212 eV2sd ) pass through\nthe QPC with the unitary probability. However, the electrons in the lower half of the eVsd window experience a\npotential barrier and hence\nare reflected back\n\u0002\n\u0003 (see partial\ncurrent profiles, T (E) fLF D (E) \u2212 fRF D (E) , in small insets in Figs. 2 (c), (e), (g)). Thus, the electrons injected\nfrom the left lead give rise to the conductance of the half\nof the conductance unit, Gd = 0.5 \u00d7 2e2 /h. For electrons\nmoving in the opposite direction, from the drain to the\nsource electrode, there is no available channel to propagate and all of them are reflected.\n\n\f4\n\nFIG. 3: TF and Hartree LDOS in the QPC for different\nVsd . (The same as in Fig. 2 but for the second half-integer\nplateau in the differential conductance, see arrows at Figs.\n1(a),(b),(e),(f).)\n\nA character of electron transport changes dramatically\nwhen interaction is included at the quantum-mechanical\nlevel. Figures 2 (d), (f), (h) show the LDOS inside the\nconstriction calculated within the Hartree approximation\nfor the first half-integer plateau where Gd \u2248 0.3 \u00d7 2e2 /h.\nWith one partially propagating mode the electron density inside the constriction is low and the screening is\nrather week, and hence the electron interaction strongly\nmodifies the potential profile in comparison to the symmetric TF distribution. The Coulomb charging pushes\nup the upper 1D subband inside the QPC constriction\nto the top of the eVsd window near the source contact. (It is interesting to note that the LDOS inside the\nQPC out of equilibrium resembles a corresponding selfconsistent LDOS profile of a resonant-tunneling diode\n[17]). Thus, the 1D subbands becomes pinned to the top\nof the eVsd window and therefore only a relatively narrow energy interval can supply current-carrying states\nthat pass through the QPC (see current profiles in the\ninsets to Fig. 2 (d),(f),(h)). Hence, the QPC conductance, Gd \u2248 0.3 \u00d7 2e2 /h, becomes smaller than a\nhalf of the conductance unit G0 = 2e2 /h. Our calculations provide therefore a microscopic foundation of the\nphenomenological approaches that describe the \"0.25anomaly\" assuming a nonsymmetric voltage drop inside\nthe constriction[5, 9].\nLet us now turn to higher half-integer plateaus. In this\ncase there is at least one propagating state inside the\nconstriction, which, in turn, leads to enhanced screening. Indeed, despite of the voltage drop between the left\nand the right leads, the Hartree effective potentials Vef f\nand the LDOS are practically flat inside the QPC, see\nFigs. 3 (b), (d). This is in contrast to the correspond-\n\ning TF results which do not account for screening and\nthus follow the linear drop of Vbias , see Figs. 3 (a), (c).\nBecause of the enhanced screening, at the center of the\nQPC the Hartree 1D subbands are situated lower than\nthe corresponding TF subbands (i.e below EFL \u2212 eV2sd ),\nand hence the energy window providing the transmitted\nstates through the QPC exceeds the half of the available\nenergy interval eVsd (see the current profiles in the inset\nof Fig. 3 (b), (d)). As a result, the QPC conductance\ncorresponding to the highest subband is larger than a\nhalf of the conductance unit G0 . (Note that all lower\nsubbands are fully occupied and thus contribute to one\nconductance unit each). Thus, the enhanced screening,\nwhich becomes more pronounced as Vsd increases, is the\nreason for the upward bending of the higher half-integer\nplateaus.\nFinally, we stress that we utilized a model of spinless\nelectrons in the Hartree approximation. The present approach can be easily extended to account for the spin effect within the framework of the spin-density functional\ntheory (SDFT). However, some previous studies questioned the reliability of the SDFT for the system at hand\nbecause of the self-interaction errors of the local spin\ndensity approximation [18]. Hence, the definite answer\nabout the role of the spin in the non-linear conductance\nof the QPC might require approaches that go beyond\nthe mean field method used in the present study (e.g.\nquantum Monte-Carlo, etc.). At the same time, an excellent quantitative agreement of our calculations with\nthe experimental results outlines the dominant role of the\nself-consistent electrostatics and the nonlinear screening\nand strongly indicates that the \"0.25-feature\" is not spinrelated.\nTo conclude, using NEGF formalism within the\nHartree model of spinless electrons we reproduced quantitatively the observed features of the nonlinear QPC\nconductance and provide microscopic interpretation of\nthe \"0.25-anomaly\" as well as the upward bending of the\nhigher half-integer plateaus in terms of non-linear screening and pinning effect.\nThis work has been supported by the Swedish Research\nCouncil (VR).\nAPPENDIX: NON-EQUILIBRIUM GREENS\nFUNCTION (NEGF) TECHNIQUE FOR\nCALCULATION OF THE TRANSMISSION\nCOEFFICIENT OF THE QPC\n\nThe central quantity in the NEGF is the lesser Green's\nfunction, G< [12]. To calculate it one has to find first the\nretarded Green's function, Gr ,\n(E \u2212 H(r)) Gr (r, r\u2032 , E) = 1,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere E is an electron energy and 1 is the unitary operator.

(For the sake\nof shortness we will not write explicitly a coordinate dependence of Gr ). \u03a3rR(L) are functions with non-zero values only at the boundaries with the semi-infinitive leads.\nCoupling the scattering region with leads is described by\nthe functions\ni\u0393R (E) = \u03a3rR (E) \u2212 \u03a3aR (E) = 2i Im [\u03a3rR (E)] ,\ni\u0393L (E) =\n\n\u03a3rL (E)\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03a3aL (E)\n\n= 2i\n\nIm [\u03a3rL (E)] .\n\nFD\nare the Fermi-Dirac functions in the\nwhere fR(L)\n(left) lead.

(5) is used. Along the Path 1 only several\nintegration points are needed because the rapid variations of G<\neq (E) are smeared out when the integration\npath is far from the real axis. This is specially useful for\nthe bound states, which give rise to sharp peaks near the\nreal axis. On the straight path along the real axis, one\nneeds much more integration points and for large sourcedrain voltage it becomes the most time consuming part\nof computation.\nEquations (2)-(7) are solved self-consistently in an iterative way until a converged solution for the electron\ndensity and potential (and hence for the total Green's\nfunction) is obtained. Having calculated the total selfconsistent Greens functions, the transmission coefficient\nis calculated as [12]\n\n(5)\nright\nnonfLF D .\nleads\n(6)\n\nIt is also valid under a bias voltage at energies E for which\nFD\n= 1 for those energies).\nfRF D = fLF D (in practice, fR(L)\nIn order to calculate the electron density we integrate\nover the electron energy E\nZ\n\u0002\n\u0003\n1\ndE Im G< (r, r, E) .\n(7)\nn(r) = \u2212\n2\u03c0\nWe use both Eqs.

Thus, for the energies\nFD\nwhen fR(L)\n= 1 we can use G<\neq (E) for which we can\ntransform the integration path from the real axis to the\ncomplex plane [19], see Fig. 4, where G<\neq (E) is a smooth\nfunction of energy.
