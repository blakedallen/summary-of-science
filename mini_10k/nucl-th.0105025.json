INTRODUCTION\n\nCollective excitation in exotic unstable nuclei, especially in neutron-rich nuclei near the drip-line, is one of\nthe most interesting nuclear structure issues. The presence of the neutron halo or skin structures, or more\ngenerally of loosely bound neutrons and the very shallow Fermi energy will modify characters of collective\nexcitations known in stable nuclei. It is further interesting if new kinds of collective mode emerge. The\nlinear response theory or the random phase approximation is one of the powerful tools to study such issues.\nSince the method itself is a general framework to describe normal modes of excitation built on a reference\nstate given by mean-field approximations [1], it is advantageous to, rather than very light drip-line nuclei\nsuch as 11 Li, heavier systems which will be studied in future experiments. Previous works in this direction\nhave analyzed the giant resonances and the threshold neutron strength in exotic nuclei with closed shell\nconfigurations [2\u20134] with use of the continuum linear response theory formulated in the coordinate space\n[5,6]. However, to explore more systematically nuclei with open shell configurations, the theory has to be\nextended so as to take into account the pairing correlation, which may play essential roles especially for\nlow-lying collective excitations.\nIndeed the pairing correlation is a key element in the study of nuclei near the drip-line [7\u20139]. A special\nfeature of the pairing in drip-line nuclei is that the correlation takes place not only among bound orbits\nin the potential well but also in continuum states above the zero energy threshold. The Hartree-FockBogoliubov (HFB) theory formulated in the coordinate space representation [7,8] has a great power in this\nrespect since it allows one to treat properly the pairing in the continuum orbits, whereas the conventional\nBCS approximation is not suited for this purpose. The coordinate space HFB has been applied extensively\nand clarifying some aspects of pairing effects on the ground state properties including the halo and the\nskin [7,8,10\u201317]. Descriptions of deformed exotic nuclei are also under current developments [18\u201322]. The\ncoordinate space HFB has been also used together with the relativistic mean-field models [23\u201325].\nThe shallow Fermi energy in drip-line nuclei makes the threshold for particle continuum very low. It is\ntherefore important to include effects of the continuum states in describing not only the ground state but also\nthe excitation modes. Attempts have been made to describe both the pairing correlation and the continuum\neffects on collective states in the linear response formalism. These continuum quasiparticle linear response\ntheories [26\u201329], however, rely on the conventional BCS approximation, which may not be very accurate\nnear the drip-lines. On the other hand, an approach is proposed to build a quasiparticle random phase\napproximation (QRPA) with use of the canonical basis in the coordinate space HFB [30]. However, the\ncontinuum effect is not precisely accounted in this approach since the single-quasiparticle basis is discretized.\nOther QRPA models using the discrete BCS quasiparticle basis [31\u201333] have a similar problem.\nIn the present paper, we extend the approach of Ref. [5] and formulate a new continuum quasiparticle\nlinear response theory that is fully based on the coordinate space HFB formalism, so that the theory can\ntake into account coupling to the continuum configurations both in describing the pairing in the ground\nstate and in description of collective excitations. A novel feature is that it includes, for the first time in\nthe quasiparticle linear response formalism, the configurations where excited two quasiparticles are both\noccupying the continuum orbits above the threshold. We pay a special attention to consistency between\nthe treatment of the pairing correlation in the static HFB and that in the linear response equation for\n\n1\n\n\fthe collective excitations. This selfconsistency is quite important as we shall demonstrate in the following.\nWe also discuss some basic features of pairing effects on collective excitations, taking as an example the\nquadrupole response in neutron rich oxygen isotopes including drip-line nucleus 24 O.\nThe sections \u00a7\u00a72 and 3 are devoted to derivation of the basic equations of the linear response equations.\nNumerical results for oxygen isotopes are discussed in \u00a74, and conclusions are drawn in \u00a75.\nII. TIME-DEPENDENT HARTREE-FOCK-BOGOLIUBOV EQUATION IN COORDINATE\nREPRESENTATION AND LINEARIZATION\nA. TDHFB in coordinate space\n\nThe linear response theory or the random phase approximation can be formulated generally as a small\namplitude limit of the time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) equation. Now in order to include the pairing\ncorrelations, we shall base our formulation on the time-dependent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (TDHFB) theory.\nThe TDHFB equations is often formulated with use of the discrete shell model single-particle basis and the\nThouless representation [1,34], which however are not convenient to treat the continuum states. Thus we shall\nstart our formulation with writing the basic equations of TDHFB in the coordinate space representation. It is\nan extension of the coordinate space HFB of Ref. [7] to time-dependent problems. We follow the notation of\nRef. [7] in many aspects, while there are some differences since we do not impose the time-reversal symmetry\nassumed in Ref. [7].\nThe ground state of the system |\u03a60 i in the HFB formalism is a vacuum of the Bogoliubov quasiparticles.\nWe denote the annihilation and creation operators of the quasiparticles by {\u03b2i , \u03b2i\u2020 }(i = 1, * * *), which satisfy\nthe vacuum condition \u03b2i |\u03a60 i = 0. The nucleon operators \u03c8(r\u03c3) and \u03c8 \u2020 (r\u03c3), where \u03c3 = \u00b11/2 denotes the\nspinor component, can be expanded by the quasiparticle operators as\nX\nX\n\u03c61,i (r\u03c3)\u03b2i \u2212 \u03c6\u22172,i (r\u03c3\u0303)\u03b2i\u2020 ,\n(1a)\nUi (r\u03c3)\u03b2i + Vi\u2217 (r\u03c3)\u03b2i\u2020 =\n\u03c8(r\u03c3) =\ni\n\ni\n\n\u2020\n\n\u03c8 (r\u03c3) =\n\nX\n\nUi\u2217 (r\u03c3)\u03b2i\u2020\n\n+ Vi (r\u03c3)\u03b2i =\n\nX\ni\n\ni\n\n\u03c6\u22171,i (r\u03c3)\u03b2i\u2020 \u2212 \u03c62,i (r\u03c3\u0303)\u03b2i .\n\n(1b)\n\nHere \u03c61,i (r\u03c3) and \u03c62,i (r\u03c3) are the single-quasiparticle wave functions that satisfy the coordinate space HFB\nequation [7] (see also the later description). We do not write explicitly the isospin degrees of freedom for\nsimplicity although in actual applications the pairing correlation is taken into account separately for neutrons\nand protons. In the present paper we use functions \u03c61,i (r\u03c3) \u2261 Ui (r\u03c3) and \u03c62,i (r\u03c3) \u2261 Vi (r\u03c3\u0303) instead of\nUi (r\u03c3) and Vi (r\u03c3) for the convenience of notation whereas Ui (r\u03c3) and Vi (r\u03c3) correspond more directly to\nthe U, V matrices in the HFB formalism in the discrete shell model basis [1]. The symbol \u03c6(r\u03c3\u0303) for a spinor\nfunction \u03c6(r\u03c3) denotes \u03c6(r\u03c3\u0303) \u2261 (\u22122\u03c3)\u03c6(r \u2212 \u03c3) = (\u2212i\u03c3y \u03c6)(r\u03c3). For the time-reversal convention, we employ\nT \u03c6(r\u03c3) \u2261 \u03c6\u2217 (r\u03c3\u0303) = (\u2212i\u03c3y \u03c6\u2217 )(r\u03c3). These conventions are the same as in Ref. [7]. We also use a notation\n\u03c6\u0129 (r\u03c3) \u2261 \u03c6\u2217 (r\u03c3\u0303) for the time-reversed function.\nIn a time dependent problem, the system is described by a TDHFB state vector |\u03a6(t)i.

Linearization\n\nLet us consider a TDHFB state vector |\u03a6(t)i which fluctuates around the HFB ground state |\u03a60 i under\nperturbation of an external field. The external perturbation induces also fluctuation in the selfconsistent\nmean-field. We now write the time-dependent mean-field Hamiltonian as \u0125(t) = \u01250 + V\u0302 (t) where \u01250 denotes\nthe static selfconsistent HFB mean-field Hamiltonian for the ground state while the fluctuating field V\u0302 (t)\ncontains both the external field V\u0302 ext (t) and the induced field V\u0302 ind (t).

To describe response of the time-dependent single-quasiparticle wave\nfunction \u03c6i (r\u03c3t) to the perturbation, we expand it up to the linear order as\n\u03c6i (r\u03c3t) = e\u2212iEi (t\u2212t0 )/h\u0304 (\u03c6i (r\u03c3) + \u03b4\u03c6i (r\u03c3t)) .\n\n(15)\n\nHere \u03c6i (r\u03c3) and Ei denote the quasiparticle functions and the quasiparticle excitation energy defined as a\nsolution of the static HFB equation for the ground state,\nH0 \u03c6i (r\u03c3) = Ei \u03c6i (r\u03c3),\n\n(16)\n\nwhere H0 is the 2 \u00d7 2 matrix representation of the static HFB mean-field Hamiltonian \u01250 .\nAn useful tool in describing the linear response is the single-particle Green function, which in our case is\nthe single-quasiparticle Green function defined for the static HFB mean-field Hamiltonian \u01250 .

Integral representation\n\nIf the nucleus is put in the space of infinite volume, the spectrum of HFB single-quasiparticle states become\ncontinuum for the quasiparticle excitation energy E which exceeds the one-particle separation energy S1 = |\u03bb|\n[7,35]. Accordingly, the single-quasiparticle HFB Green function G0 also exhibits the continuum spectrum.\nFurthermore, the HFB Green function at the continuum energy is required to satisfy the boundary condition\nof outgoing wave in the exterior region of the nucleus [35], which is a suitable boundary condition for the\ncontinuum states. Let's us implement these features in the response functions.\n\nImE\n\n(a)\n\nC\n\ni \u03b5'\n-i \u03b5'\n(b)\n\nReE\n-Ecut\nC'\n\n0\n\n\u2212\u03bb\n\n\u03bb\n\nFIG. 1. Contours C and C \u2032 in the integral representation of the response function. The crosses represent the poles\nat E = \u00b1Ei corresponding to the bound quasiparticle states. The thick lines are the branch cuts.\n\nThis task is accomplished in two steps. Firstly, we handle the continuity of the HFB quasiparticle spectrum.\nFor this purpose, we rewrite the summation over the HFB quasiparticles in Eq.(34) with use of an integral\nP\n\u2020\nrepresentation. Namely, a summation i f (\u2212Ei )\u03c6\u0129 (r)\u03c6\u0129 (r\u03c3) is replaced by a contour integral in the complex\nE plane as\nZ\nX\n1\n\u2020\nf (\u2212Ei )\u03c6\u0129 (r)\u03c6\u0129 (r\u03c3) =\ndEf (E)G0 (E),\n(37)\n2\u03c0i C\ni\n7\n\n\fin terms of the HFB Green function G0 , Eq.(19), which has poles at E = \u2212Ei on the negative energy axis.\nThe contour has to be chosen so that it encloses these poles, and at the same time, it must avoid the poles\nassociated with G0 (E + h\u0304\u03c9 + i\u01eb) and G0 (E \u2212 h\u0304\u03c9 \u2212 i\u01eb) that account for G0 (\u2212Ei + h\u0304\u03c9 + i\u01eb) and G0 (\u2212Ei \u2212 h\u0304\u03c9 \u2212 i\u01eb)\nin Eq.(34). A contour C satisfying this requirement is shown in Fig.1(a), where the constant \u01eb\u2032 must satisfy\n\u01eb > \u01eb\u2032 > 0. Consequently, the unperturbed response function is expressed as\nZ\nX\n1\nR0\u03b1\u03b2 (r, r \u2032 , \u03c9) =\ndE\n{TrAG0 (r\u03c3, r \u2032 \u03c3 \u2032 , E + h\u0304\u03c9 + i\u01eb)BG0 (r \u2032 \u03c3 \u2032 , r\u03c3, E)\n4\u03c0i C\n\u2032\n\u03c3\u03c3\n\n+TrAG0 (r\u03c3, r \u2032 \u03c3 \u2032 , E)BG0 (r\u2032 \u03c3 \u2032 , r\u03c3, E \u2212 h\u0304\u03c9 \u2212 i\u01eb)} .\n\nThe contour is the same as those adopted in Refs.

RPA response functions\n\nLet us now describe linear response of the system by including correlation effects caused by the residual\ninteractions among nucleons. The correlation brings about the induced field, which can be described as a\nfluctuating part of the selfconsistent mean-field associated with the TDHFB state vector |\u03a6(t)i. Generally,\nthe expectation value of the total energy for |\u03a6(t)i is a functional E[R] = E[\u03c1, \u03c1\u0303, \u03c1\u0303\u2217 ] of the generalized density\nmatrix R, or \u03c1, \u03c1\u0303, and \u03c1\u0303\u2217 .

We consider both neutrons and protons in the actual application. Then the density response \u03b4\u03c1\nhave six components (three for each isospin).

Previous\ncontinuum QRPA's (or the continuum quasiparticle linear response theories) [26\u201329] adopt approximations\nthat take into account the continuum boundary condition only for the normal Green function G0 (E), but not\nfor the abnormal Green function F0 (E), while we have treated the single-quasiparticle HFB Green function\nexactly by using the construction by Belyaev et al. [35]. We also emphasize that the present theory includes\nthe configurations where two nucleons are both in the continuum states. Since the HFB single-quasiparticle\nspectrum is made of the discrete bound orbits and the continuum unbound states, two-quasiparticle states\nare classified in three groups. The first is the one where both quasiparticles occupy two discrete bound\nstates. The second is where one quasiparticle is in a bound state with discrete excitation energy Ei while\nthe second quasiparticle occupy the continuum unbound states whose excitation energy E exceeds |\u03bb|. These\none-particle continuum states emerge above a threshold excitation energy Eth,1 = minEi + |\u03bb|, where minEi\nis the minimum quasiparticle excitation energy. In the unpaired limit, this threshold energy becomes identical\nto the excitation energy \u2212eh,last of nucleon from the last occupied hole orbit to the zero-energy threshold. The\nlast group of two-quasiparticle states is the one where both two quasiparticles occupy continuum unbound\nstates. The threshold excitation energy for the two-particle continuum states is Eth,2 = 2|\u03bb|, i.e. it is\n10\n\n\ftwice the one-particle separation energy S1 . The present theory includes all the three groups as seen in\nEq. (43), whereas the previous approaches include only the configurations where only one nucleon is in the\ncontinuum states. Escaping processes of one particle to the external region takes part in at the excitation\nenergy h\u0304\u03c9 > Eth,1 above the one-particle threshold, and consequently the strength functions show continuum\nspectra. At excitation energy h\u0304\u03c9 > Eth,2 above the two-particle threshold, processes of two-particle escaping\ncontribute. A related point is that the previous continuum QRPA's adopt the BCS approximation that has\ndifficulty to describe the pairing in the continuum, whereas we have exploited the coordinate space HFB\nformalism to remove the shortcoming.\nSecondly, the present theory takes into account the particle-particle correlations associated with fluctuations in the pair densities \u03b4 \u03c1\u0303+ , and \u03b4 \u03c1\u0303\u2212 , which always emerge in paired systems. In other words, the pairing\nresidual interaction contributes to the linear response equation (58). This particle-particle correlation has\nbeen neglected in many continuum quasiparticle linear response theories or QRPA's. Even when it is included [26,27], its effect is not clarified. We emphasize that this contribution should be included to keep a\nselfconsistency of the pairing correlation, and it indeed has important consequences. This point is discussed\nin detail in the next section.\nThirdly, the present theory reduces to the continuum linear response theory for unpaired systems [5] if\nthe HFB ground state has the zero pairing potential. This is easily seen in Eq.(43), which, in the zero\npairing limit, has only the discrete part consisting of the occupied hole orbits \u03c6nlj . Note also that only the\n11 component (the normal Green function G0 ) of G0 contributes to the response function for the density\noperator \u03c1\u0302(r). In this sense, the present theory is an extension of Ref. [5] to paired systems described by the\ncoordinate space HFB.\nIV. NUMERICAL ANALYSIS\n\nWe apply the above formalism to spin independent quadrupole excitations in open-shell oxygen isotopes\nnear the neutron drip-line, where both the pairing correlation and the continuum effects may play important\nroles. In the following, we mainly discuss results for the drip-line nucleus 24 O. Since our purpose in this\npaper is to clarify basic characteristics of the theory, rather than to make a precise prediction, we adopt a\nsimple model Hamiltonian which consists of a spherical Woods-Saxon potential and the residual two-body\ninteractions.\nAs a pairing force we assume the density-dependent delta force [9,37]\nvpair (r, r\u2032 ) =\n\n1\nV0 (1 \u2212 P\u03c3 )(1 \u2212 \u03c1(r)/\u03c10 )\u03b4(r \u2212 r\u2032 ),\n2\n\n(60)\n\nwhere P\u03c3 is the spin exchange operator. The interaction strength depends on the position through the total\nnucleon density \u03c1(r) = \u03c1n (r) + \u03c1p (r). With \u03c10 = 0.16fm\u22123 (the saturation density), the pairing force is more\neffective at low-density nuclear surface than in the interior region. The density-dependent pairing force is\nwidely adopted in the HFB calculations not only for unstable isotopes [8,14,18,19,22,23] but also for rapidly\nrotating deformed nuclei [37,38].\nTo obtain the ground state, we solve the radial HFB equation with the box boundary condition \u03c6i (r =\nRmax ) = 0 according to the procedure of Ref. [7], and determine selfconsistently the nucleon density \u03c1q (r)(q =\nn, p), the pair density \u03c1\u0303q (r) and the pairing potential \u2206q (r) = V0 (1 \u2212 \u03c1(r)/\u03c10 )\u03c1\u0303q (r). For the Woods-Saxon\npotential we adopt the standard parameter set [39,40]. We have used the radial mesh size \u2206r = 0.2 fm,\nand the cut-off at Rmax = 20 fm. To evaluate the densities and the pairing potential, we include all\nthe quasiparticle states whose excitation energy is below Emax = 50 MeV and with the orbital angular\nmomentum lmax \u2264 7h\u0304. The pairing force strength V0 is chosen V0,n = V0,p = 520fm\u22123 MeV so that the\n\u221a average\nneutron pairing gap h\u2206n i in 18,20 O approximately agrees Rwith the overall Rsystematics \u2206 \u2248 12/ A \u2248 2.8\nMeV [40].PHere we define\nP the average gap by h\u2206n i = dr \u03c1\u0303(r)\u2206n (r)/ dr \u03c1\u0303(r), which corresponds to\nh\u2206n iuv = \u03bc u\u03bc v\u03bc \u2206\u03bc / \u03bc u\u03bc v\u03bc (\u03bc denoting the canonical basis) adopted recently in the literature [41,38,22].\nThe calculated average neutron gap is h\u2206n i = 2.74, 3.13, 3.30, and 3.39 MeV for 18,20,22,24 O, respectively.\nNote that the pairing gap increases as approaching the neutron drip-line line. For comparison, we use\nalso the density-independent pairing interaction (the volume-type pairing), which is given by dropping the\ndensity-dependent term in Eq.(60). In this case, we use V0 = 240fm\u22123 MeV, \u03c10 = \u221e so that the calculated\naverage neutron gap h\u2206n i = 2.70, 2.69, 2.26, 1.64 MeV (for 18,20,22,24 O) gives approximately the same value\nin 18,20 O. The neutron pairing gap for the volume-type pairing decreases as increasing the neutron number,\n\n11\n\n\fespecially at the drip-line nucleus 24 O. This trend is opposite to that for the density-dependent pairing,\nand consequently the calculated pairing correlation differs significantly for 22,24 O located near drip-lines even\nthough the force parameter is adjusted in more stable 18,20 O. Apparently, the density-dependent pairing force\nfavors the pairing correlation in the low-density surface region which develops in nuclei near the drip-line.\nThis is a characteristic feature of the density-dependent pairing [7,8,14].\nThe quadrupole response of the system is described by means of the linear response formalism presented\nin the previous section. As the residual interaction acting in the particle-particle channel, we use the same\npairing interaction as that used for the static HFB calculation in order to keep the selfconsistency, which\nturns out very important in the following. For the particle-hole channel, we assume the Skyrme-type delta\nforce\nvph (r, r \u2032 ) = (t0 (1 + x0 P\u03c3 ) + t3 (1 + x3 P\u03c3 )\u03c1(r)) \u03b4(r \u2212 r\u2032 ),\n\n(61)\n\nwhere we adopt the same parameter as Ref. [5]; t0 = f \u00d7 (\u22121100)fm3 MeV, t3 = f \u00d7 16000fm6 MeV, x0 = 0.5\nand x3 = 1. Here the renormalization factor f is adjustedP\nby imposing\nPa selfconsistency [5] that the calculated\nIS\nstatic polarizability for the isoscalar dipole field D1M\n= n rY1M + p rY1M becomes zero for each nucleus.\nThe linear response equations are solved in the following way. The unperturbed response function is obtained\nby evaluating Eq.(42) where the contour integral is performed numerically with an energy step |\u2206E| = \u01eb/16.\nWe use a small smoothing constant \u01eb = 0.2 MeV, which corresponds to a smoothing with a Lorentzian\nfunction with FWHM of 0.4 MeV. As for the HFB Green function we adopt the exact expression (44), and\nevaluate the radial functions (also the response functions) by using the mesh \u2206r = 0.2fm and the cut-off\nradius Rmax = 20fm. In evaluating Eq.(42), we introduce also the angular momentum cut-off lmax = 7h\u0304.\nThese parameters are the same as in solving the static HFB calculation. The cut-off energy for the contour\nintegral is Ecut = 50 MeV, which is a natural choice since it is the same cut-off energy Emax for the static\nHFB. Because the value of Ecut is larger than the potential depth (measured from the Fermi energy), the\ncontour integral can include all the hole orbits in the limiting case of the zero pairing potential. We thus\nguarantee that in the zero pairing limit the evaluated response function for the density operator becomes\nidentical to the response function for unpaired systems [5]. The RPA response functions R\u03b1\u03b2 (r, r\u2032 , h\u0304\u03c9) is\nobtained by solving Eq.(58), which is a 600 \u00d7 600 linear matrix equation in the radial mesh representation.\nFigure 2 shows the strength functions calculated for theP\nquadrupole excitation in 24 O.

These two modes correspond\nto isoscalar(IS) and isovector(IV) giant quadrupole resonances (GQR) whereas they are not pure ISGQR nor\nIVGQR since a large admixture of isovector (isoscalar) strength is present in each resonance region of the\nisoscalar (isovector) modes.\n\n12\n\n\f1500\n\n300\n\n250\n\nS\u03c4(\u0088\u03c9) [fm4 /MeV]\n\nIS\n\n1250\n1000\n\nneutron\n\n200\n750\nIV\n\n500\n\n150\n\n250\n\n100\n\nproton\n\nIS\nneutron\n\n0\n0\n\nIV\n\n50\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\nproton\n\n0\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n\u0088\u03c9\n\nEth\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n[MeV]\n\nFIG. 2.\nThe strength functions for the quadrupole moments Q\u03c42M (\u03c4 = IS, IV, n, p) in 24 O with use of the\ndensity-dependent pairing force.

The inset shows a magnified part\nfor the low excitation energy h\u0304\u03c9 < 10MeV. The threshold energy Eth,1 = Eth,2 = 2|\u03bb| = 4.14 MeV is indicated by an\narrow.\n\nThe peak excitation energy of the low-lying mode is h\u0304\u03c9 = 5.0MeV. Since the threshold energies for oneneutron and two-neutron continuum states are, Eth,1 = Eth,2 = 4.14MeV, the low-lying neutron quadruple\nmode is embedded in the neutron continuum states. The FWHM width of this mode \u2248 45keV is almost the\nsame as the smoothing width 2\u01eb = 40keV, indicating that the mode has very small escaping width in spite\nof the coupling to the neutron continuum states.\nThe low-lying quadrupole mode at h\u0304\u03c9 \u2248 5.0MeV is characterized by very large neutron strength. The\nisoscalar strength is also large, but the proton strength is small. The isovector strength is sizable but smaller\nthan the neutron and isoscalar strengths because the small proton contribution is in phase with the neutrons.\nThe integrated neutron strength B(Qn 2) below h\u0304\u03c9 = 6.0 MeV is 605fm4 whereas B(E2)(= e2 B(Qp 2)) is\nonly 16.4e2fm4 . Converting the strengths to the neutron proton ratio Mn /Mp for the quadrupole transition\namplitudes, it is evaluated as Mn /Mp = 6.1. The neutron character of this mode is apparent by comparing this\nvalue to a simple macroscopic estimate Mn /Mp = N/Z = 2. The low-lying mode exhausts approximately\n20%, 10% and 19%, of the sum rule value for the isoscalar, isovector, and neutron quadrupole transition\nstrength, respectively (See Eq.(62) and Fig. 6(a)). This ratio is much larger than a typical value for the\nlow-lying isoscalar quadrupole mode (\u223c 10%) [42]. On the contrary, the proton strength (i.e. the B(E2)\nstrength) is small, exhausting only 2% of the energy weighted sum rule. The strength of the low-lying neutron\nmode is continuated to the neutron strength distribution in the interval (h\u0304\u03c9 \u2248 6 \u2212 15 MeV) between the\nlow-lying mode and the giant resonances, which corresponds to the so called threshold strength. However,\nthe character of the low-lying neutron mode clearly differs from that of the threshold strength [2] since its\nlarge neutron strength of collective nature is generated by the residual interaction (see below). We note also\nthat the HFB single-quasiparticle states have no discrete bound orbits, instead they are all continuum states\nor resonances. The low-lying neutron mode is a collective state made of continuum two-quasiparticle states.\nWe have also calculated the quadruple strength functions for 18,20,22 O. The peak energies of the lowlying mode is h\u0304\u03c9 = 4.2, 4.1, 4.5, 5.0 MeV for A = 18, 20, 22, 24, respectively, which is 1 \u2212 2 MeV higher\nthan the experiments [32,43\u201346]. The calculated neutron strength (B(Qn 2) = 152, 295, 426, 605fm4 for\nA=18-24) increases sharply with increasing the neutron number. On the contrary, the calculated B(E2) =\n15, 18, 17, 17e2fm4 (A = 18 \u2212 24) stays almost constant. The calculation underestimates the experimental\n13\n\n\fB(E2) value [43,44,32,45] by a factor of 3-1.5 for 18,20 O, but with reasonable agreement in 22 O. The calculated B(E2) values differs by a factor of 0.5-1.5 from the quasiparticle RPA calculation in Ref. [31,32]. The\nadopted model Hamiltonian, especially the Woods-Saxon potential, should be improved to make more quantitative comparison, e.g. by using more realistic Skyrme interaction both for the Hartree-Fock potential and\nfor the particle-hole interactions. Leaving such improvements for a future investigation, we in the following\nfocus on basic aspects of the present theory.\n\n1500\n\n300\n\nDiscretized\n\nS\u03c4(\u0088\u03c9) [fm4 /MeV]\n\n250\n\n1250\n1000\n\n200\n750\n150\n\nIS\n\n500\n250\n\n100\n\n0\n0\n\n50\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\nproton\n\n0\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n\u0088\u03c9\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n[MeV]\n\np\n24\nFIG. 3. The strength functions for the isoscalar and proton quadrupole moments QIS\nO with use of\n2M and Q2M in\nthe density-dependent pairing force, calculated with the discretized continuum states (see text). The renormalization\nfactor for the particle-hole residual interaction is f = 0.702. Solid and dotted curves represent those for QIS\n2M and\nQp2M , respectively.\n\nThe present theory takes into account the one- and two-particle continuum states without making any\ndiscretization method or bound state approximation. It is interesting in this respect to see difference between\nthe results presented above and results that would have been obtained by using discretized continuum states.\nWe show in Fig.3 the strength function obtained by using the discrete spectral representation Eq.(35) instead\nof Eq.(42). Here we solve discrete single-quasiparticle states with the box boundary condition \u03c6i (Rmax ) = 0,\nand adopt all the quasiparticle states with the excitation energy Ei below the energy cut-off Emax = 50\nMeV and the angular momentum cut-off lmax = 7, including the discretized states in the continuum region\nEi > |\u03bb|. The renormalization factor f is slightly changed in this approximate calculation in order to\nreproduce the zero energy dipole mode. With use of the discretized continuum approximation, the strength\nfunction consists only of discrete states (but smeared with the smoothing width) even in the continuum region\nabove the threshold. This causes spurious fluctuation, as seen in Fig.3. It is noted on the other hand that a\ngross profile of the strength distribution is described fairly well by the discretizing approximation. It can be\nexpected that in the limit of large box size Rmax \u2192 \u221e, the discretizing approximation would give the same\nresults with the one obtained with the continuum linear response theory, whereas such limiting is practically\nvery difficult. Note also that the strengths associated with the low-lying neutron mode at h\u0304\u03c9 \u2248 5 MeV are\nalmost reproduced by the discretizing approximation. This is because the low-lying mode in the present\nmodel calculation is a very narrow resonance, for which a bound state approximation can be a reasonable\napproximation.\n\n14\n\n\f1500\n\n300\n\n1250\n\nSIS (\u0088\u03c9) [fm4 /MeV]\n\n250\n\n\u03c1-pairing\n\n1000\n200\n\nvolume\npairing\n\nno pairing\n\n750\nno pairing\n\n150\n\nvolume\npairing\n\n100\n\n\u03c1-pairing\n\n500\n250\n0\n0\n\n50\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n0\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n\u0088\u03c9\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n[MeV]\n\nFIG. 4.\nDependence of the quadrupole strength function in 24 O on the pairing interaction. Plotted are the\nstrength functions for the isoscalar quadrupole moment QIS\n2M for the density-dependent pairing (dashed curve), for\nthe volume-type pairing (solid), and for the case where the pairing is neglected (dotted). See text for details. The\nrenormalization factor for the particle-hole residual interaction is f = 0.702.\n\nThe pairing correlation play various important roles for the response. We show in Fig.4 the calculation\nwithout the pairing correlation (i.e. the pairing interaction is neglected both in the static HFB and the linear\nresponse equation). In this case, the quadrupole strength in the low-energy region becomes much smaller.\nThe small peak at h\u0304 \u2248 3.0 MeV is not very collective, but it is basically non-collective neutron particle-hole\ntransition 2s 21 \u2192 1d 32 with slight enhancement due to correlation. It is clearly seen that the pairing increases\nthe collectivity of the low-lying neutron mode. The pairing effect on the low-lying isoscalar quadrupole\nmode in stable nuclei is well known [42]. Our result suggests a similar effect on the neutron mode, which is\nembedded in the continuum states in the case of drip-line nuclei.\nWe found further that the low-lying neutron mode is quite sensitive to the density-dependence of the\npairing. Figure 4 shows also the result that is obtained with the density-independent volume-type pairing\nforce in place of the density-dependent one Eq.(60). The neutron (and isoscalar) strength in the low-lying\nneutron mode obtained in this calculation is significantly small, i.e. it is about 50% of that with the densitydependent pairing. Using this sensitivity, one may be able to probe the density-dependence of the pairing.\nThe difference between the density-dependent and the volume pairing is most significant in 24 O, but not very\nlarge in the other oxygen isotopes, which is in accordance with the behavior of the average neutron gap h\u2206n i\ndiscussed above. Fig. 4 shows that the pairing correlation influences also the strength distribution in the\ngiant resonance region. It has an effect to reduce the strength in the high lying modes. An apparent reason is\nthat the low-lying neutron mode collects nearly 20% of the total energy weighted isoscalar and neutron sums\nin the case of the surface pairing, and removes corresponding amount of strength from the giant resonance\nregion because of the sum rule. The peak position and width (distribution profile) of GR's are also slightly\naffected by the pairing.\n\n15\n\n\f1500\n\n300\n\nNo dynamical\n\nS\u03c4(\u0088\u03c9) [fm4 /MeV]\n\n250\n\n1250\n1000\n\n200\n750\n500\n\n150\n\n250\n\n100\n\n0\n0\n\n50\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n0\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n\u0088\u03c9\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n[MeV]\n\nFIG. 5. The same as Fig.2, but the dynamical pairing correlation effect in the linear response equation is neglected.\nNamely the density-dependent pairing is taken into account only in the static HFB mean-field.\n\nThere are two kinds of mechanisms in the pairing effects on the collective excitations. The first is a\nstatic effect. Since the static pair potential \u2206(r) in the HFB mean-field influences strongly the quasiparticle\nexcitations, it hence affects the collective excitations. The second is dynamical. It is a correlation effect\nthat is caused by the residual pairing interaction entering in the linear response equation (58). This arises\nbecause the collective excitations in the paired system induce not only the fluctuation in the density \u03b4\u03c1\nbut also the fluctuations in the pair densities \u03b4 \u03c1\u0303+ and \u03b4 \u03c1\u0303\u2212 , for which correlation is brought by the residual\npairing interaction (see, Eq.(58)). To quantify this dynamical pairing correlation effect, we show in Fig.5 a\ncalculation in which the pairing interaction is neglected in the linear response equation (58), but included\nin the static HFB mean-field. Comparison with Fig.2 shows that the dynamical pairing correlation has a\nsizable effect to lower the excitation energy of the low-lying neutron mode by about 1MeV. (One may also\nnote that the width of the low lying mode increases slightly in this calculation. ) Performing a calculation\nwhere the particle-hole interaction is neglected, we find that the low-lying neutron mode is produced also by\nthe pairing interaction alone, although the particle-hole residual interaction together is essential to make the\ncollectivity large. If we used the the conventional monopole pairing force (the seniority force) instead of the\nzero-range pairing force, the dynamical pairing correlation effect would be missed. The dynamical effect is\nrather related to effects of the quadrupole pairing that has been discussed in connection with the low-lying\nquadrupole mode in stable nuclei.\n\n16\n\n\fenergy weighted sum [fm4 MeV]\n\n25000\n\n25000\n(a) selfconsistent\n\n(b) no dynamical\n\nIS, IV\n\n20000\n\nIS, IV\n\n20000\n\nneutron\n\nneutron\n\n15000\n\n15000\n\nIS\n10000\n\n10000\n\nIV\nneutron\n\n5000\n\n5000\n\nproton\n\n0\n\nproton\n\n0\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n\u0088R\u03c9\n\n40\n\n50\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n\u0088\u03c9\n\n[MeV]\n\nh\u0304\u03c9\n\n40\n\n50\n\n[MeV]\n\nFIG. 6.

The dashed horizontal lines show the sum rule values for isoscalar (the same for\nisovector) transitions, and those for the neutron and the proton transition strengths. (b) The same as (a), but the\ndynamical pairing effect is neglected (cf. Fig.5). Namely the pairing is taken into account only in the static HFB\nmean-field.\n\nOne of the most important characteristics of the present theory is that the energy weighted sum rule\n\u0011\n\u0010\nR\u221e\n25h\u03042\nIS,IV\n2\n2\nh\u0304\u03c9S\n(h\u0304\u03c9)h\u0304d\u03c9\n=\n,\n(62a)\nN\nr\n+\nZ\nr\n4\u03c0m\n0\nn\np\nR\u221e\n2\n25h\u03042\nn,p\n2\n2\n(h\u0304\u03c9)h\u0304d\u03c9 = 25h\u0304\n(62b)\n4\u03c0m N r n , 4\u03c0m Z r p ,\n0 h\u0304\u03c9S\n\nis satisfied very accurately. The sum rule should hold since the adopted residual interactions (both the\nparticle-particle pairing force vpair and the particle-hole interaction vph ) keep the Galilei invariance [42], i.e.,\nthey commute with the quadrupole operator r2 Y2M (r\u0302). This is demonstrated in Fig. 6(a) that shows the\nR h\u0304\u03c9\ncalculated energy weighted sum 0 h\u0304\u03c9 \u2032 S \u03c4 (h\u0304\u03c9 \u2032 )h\u0304d\u03c9 \u2032 (\u03c4 = IS, IV, n, p) as a function of the energy boundary\nh\u0304\u03c9. We stress here that the selfconsistent treatment of the pairing both in the static HFB and in the\ndynamical linear response is crucial to satisfy the sum rule. This is shown in Fig. 6(b). This plots the energy\nweighted sum obtained in a truncated calculation in which the residual pairing interaction is neglected in the\nlinear response equations (cf. the corresponding strength function is shown in Fig.5). In this calculation, the\nsum rule Eq.(62) is strongly violated by about 50% for neutrons. The violation is significant especially in\nthe high lying region (E >\n\u223c 10 MeV), as the strength in this region (shown in Fig.5) apparently overestimates\nthat of the full calculation (Fig.2). The violation originates from the inconsistent treatment of the pairing\ninteraction in the calculation of Figs.5 and 6(b), where the pairing correlation is included only in the HFB\nstatic mean-field, but neglected in the linear response equation. One can understand this by noting that the\nstatic pair potential \u2206(r) violates the Galilei invariance,i.e., it does not commute with the density operator.\nBy taking into account selfconsistently the pairing interaction in the linear response equation, the Galilei\ninvariance of the original pairing interaction is recovered, and the sum-rule is satisfied. This corresponds\nto a previous result [47] showing that the sum rule violated by the monopole pairing potential can be\nremedied by including the selfconsistent quadrupole pairing interaction that recovers the Galilei invariance.\nThe selfconsistent treatment of the pairing is important especially in the case of the density-dependent pairing\nforce and in nuclei near drip-lines since in such cases the pairing potential \u2206(r) in the surface region becomes\nrelatively large.\nWe have also checked that the selfconsistency in the pairing is fulfilled in the present calculation, by\ninvestigating the Nambu-Goldstone mode in the response functions for the monopole pair operators P0\u2020 =\n17\n\n\fdrP \u2020 (r) and P0 = (P0\u2020 )\u2020 . When the HFB static pairing potential \u2206(r) is not zero, the pairing rotational\nmode that has zero excitation energy should emerge as a Nambu-Goldstone mode associated with the nucleon\nnumber conservation of the Hamiltonian, or in other word the invariance with respect to the gauge rotation\nR\nP\nei\u03b8N\u0302 [1] (N\u0302 = dr \u03c3 \u03c8 \u2020 (r\u03c3)\u03c8(r\u03c3) being the neutron or proton number operator ). The monopole response\ncalculated for 24 O exhibits the pairing rotation mode at the excitation energy very close to zero. It is found\nthat we can move the energy of the pairing rotational mode exactly at zero energy just by modifying tinily\nthe pairing force strength V0 within 1%. We also checked that the calculated monopole strength function\nfor the nucleon number operators N\u0302 carries no spurious strengths. This is again achieved by including\nselfconsistently the dynamical pairing correlation in the linear response equation.\n\nR\n\nV. CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have formulated a new continuum linear response theory on the basis of the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov\nformalism in the coordinate space representation. This enables us to describe the pairing correlation in\nnuclei near drip-lines in a selfconsistent way both in the static ground state and in the dynamical collective\nresponses. The formalism is able to include effects of the one-particle and the two-particle continuum states\non the collective excitations.\nWe have described the quadrupole response in the drip-line nucleus 24 O with use of the density-dependent\nzero-range interactions. The strength functions for the quadrupole transition moments are obtained up to\nthe giant resonance region. A low-lying mode which has significant neutron collectivity and is embedded\nin the neutron continuum states is obtained. We have analyzed in detail pairing effects important for the\nlow-lying neutron mode. It is found that the low-lying neutron mode is sensitive to the density-dependence\nof the pairing correlation especially near the drip-line. The collective excitations in paired systems induce\nfluctuations not only in the normal density but also in the pair densities. The residual part of the pairing\ninteraction causes dynamical correlation effects on the responses through the pair density fluctuations. The\npresent theory describes selfconsistently both the static pairing effect caused by the HFB pair potential and\nthe dynamical pairing correlation in the linear responses. The energy weighted sum rule is satisfied very\naccurately. This is because the selfconsistent treatment of the pairing restores the Galilei invariance, which\nwould be violated if the HFB pair potential alone was included.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe author thanks K.
