In this article1 we study conditions for the integrability of the distribution defined on a regular Poisson manifold as the orthogonal complement\n(with respect to a pseudo-Riemannian metric) to the tangent spaces of the\nleaves of a symplectic foliation. Examples of integrability and non-integrability\nof this distribution are provided.\n\n1. Introduction\nn\n\nLet (M , P ) be a regular Poisson manifold. Denote by S = {Sm |m \u2208 M } the\nsymplectic foliation of M by symplectic leaves (of constant dimension 2 \u2264 k < n in\nthe regular case). Denote by T (S) the sub-bundle of T (M ) of tangent spaces to the\nsymplectic leaves (the association x \u2192 Tx (S) is an integrable distribution on M\nwhich we will also denote by T (S)). Let M be endowed with a pseudo-Riemannian\nmetric g such that the restriction of g to each symplectic leaf is non-degenerate By\ncontinuity, the signature of the restriction of g to Tm (S) is the same for all m \u2208 M .\n\u22a5\nbe the subspace of Tm (M ) that is g-orthogonal to Sm . The assoLet Nm = Sm\nciation m \u2192 Nm defines a distribution N which is transversal and complemental\nto the distribution T (S). The restriction of the metric g to N is non-degenerate\nand has constant signature. In general, the distribution N is not integrable.\nIf the metric g is Riemannian, and if the Poisson tensor is parallel with respect to\nthe Levi-Civita connection \u2207 = \u2207g defined by g, ie: \u2207P = 0, then it is a classical\nresult of A. Lichnerowicz (see Vaisman 1994, Remark 3.11) that the distribution\nN is integrable, and the restriction of the metric g to the symplectic leaves defines, together with the symplectic structure \u03c9S = P |\u22121\nS , a K\u00e4hler structure on\nsymplectic leaves.\nIntegrability of the distribution N depends strongly on the foliation S and its\n\"transversal topology\" (see Molino 1988, Reinhart 1983, Ch.4 for the Riemannian\ncase). Thus, in general it is more a question of the theory of bundles with Ehresmann connections rather than that of Poisson geometry. Yet in some instances, it\nis useful to have integrability conditions in terms of the Poisson structure P , and\nto relate integrability of the distribution N with other structures of the Poisson\nmanifold - Casimir functions, Poisson vector fields, etc.\nOur interest in this question was influenced by our study of the representation of\na dynamical system in metriplectic form, i.e. as a sum of a Hamiltonian vector field\n(with respect to a Poisson structure, (see Bloch et al 1996, Morrison 1986, Grmela\n1990, Fish 2005) and a gradient one (with respect to a metric g). Integrability of\nthe distribution N guarantees that in the geometrical (local) splitting of the space\nM as a product of a symplectic leaf and a transversal submanifold with Casimir\nfunctions ci as local coordinates (see Weinstein 1983), the transversal submanifold\n1\n\n\f2\n\nDANIEL FISH AND SERGE PRESTON\n\ncan be chosen to be invariant under the gradient flow (with respect to the metric\ng) of the functions ci .\nAs a result one can separate observables of the system into Casimirs undergoing pure gradient (dissipative) evolution from those (along symplectic leaves)\nwhich undergo the mix of Hamiltonian and gradient evolutions. Such a separation\nleads to an essential simplification of the description of the transversal dynamics in\nmetriplectic systems.\nThe structure of this article is as follows. In Section 2 we introduce necessary\nnotions and notations. In Section 3 we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions\non the metric g and the tensor P for the distribution N to be integrable. We derive\nthese conditions in terms of covariant derivatives of the Poisson Tensor, in terms of\ncovariant derivatives of Casimir covectors, and as conditions on the nullity of the\nNijenhuis Torsion of the (1,1)-tensor A\u03bc\u03bd = P \u03bc\u03ba g\u03ba\u03bd . As a corollary we prove that the\ndistribution N is integrable if parallel translation (via the Levi-Civita connection\nof the metric g) in the direction of N preserves the symplectic distribution T (S).\nIn Section 4 we present integrability conditions in Darboux-Weinstein coordinates: the distribution N is integrable if and only if the following symmetry conditions are fulfilled for \u0393\n\u0393JIs = \u0393JIs ,\ng\u03b1\u03c3 \u0393\u03c3\u03b2\u03b3 ,\n\nwhere \u0393\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 =\nand where capital Latin letters I, J indicate the transversal\ncoordinates ,while small Latin letters indicate coordinates along symplectic leaves.\nIn Section 5 we describe some examples of non-integrability, describe a model\nexample of a 4d Poisson manifold with Poisson structure of rank 2, where the distribution N is not integrable, and discuss nonintegrability in the case of a topologically\nnontrivial symplectic fibration.\nIn Section 6 we prove integrability of N for linear Poisson structures on dual\nspaces g\u2217 of real semi-simple Lie algebras g, with the metric g induced by the Killing\nform, as well as for the dual se(3)\u2217 to the Lie algebra se(3) of Euclidian motions\nwith the simplest non-degenerate ad\u2217 -invariant metric(s) (see Zefran et al. 1996).\n2. Orthogonal distribution of Poisson manifold with a\npseudo-Riemannian metric\nLet (M n , P ) be a regular Poisson manifold. We will be use local coordinates\nx in the domains U \u2282 M with the corresponding local frame { \u2202x\u2202\u03b1 } and the dual\ncoframe dx\u03b1 . Let g be a pseudo-Riemannian metric on M as above, and let \u0393\ndenote the Levi-Civita connection associated with g. The tensor P \u03c4 \u03c3 (x) defines a\nmapping\n\u03b1\n\nP\n\n0 \u2192 C(M ) \u2192 T \u2217 (M ) \u2192 T (S) \u2192 0\nwhere C(M ) \u2282 T \u2217 (M ) is the kernel of P and T (S) is (as defined above) the\ntangent distribution of the symplectic foliation {S k }. The space C(M ) is a subbundle of the cotangent bundle T \u2217 M consisting of Casimir covectors. Locally,\nC(M ) is generated by differentials of functionally independent Casimir functions\nci (x), i = 1, . . . , n\u2212 k satisfying the condition P \u03c4 \u03c3 dci\u03c3 = 0 (in this paper we assume\nthe condition of summation by repeated indices).\nWe denote by N the distribution defined as the g-orthogonal complement\nT (S)\u22a5 to T (S) in T (M ). Then we have, at every point x a decomposition into a\n\n\fON THE INTEGRABILITY\n\n3\n\ndirect sum of distributions (sub-bundles)\nTx M = Tx (S) \u2295 Nx .\nThe assignment x \u2192 Nx defines a transverse connection for the foliation\nS, or, more exactly, for the bundle (M, \u03c0, M/S) over the space of leaves M/S,\nwhenever one is defined (see below). We are interested in finding necessary and\nsufficient conditions on P and g under which the distribution N is integrable. By\nthe Frobenius theorem, integrability of N is equivalent to the involutivity of the\ndistribution N with respect to the Lie bracket of N -valued vector fields (sections\nof the sub-bundle N \u2282 T (M )).\nLet \u03c9 i = \u03c9\u03bci dx\u03bc (i \u2264 d = n-k) be a local basis for C(M ). For any \u03b1 in T \u2217 (M ),\nlet \u03b1\u266f denote the image of \u03b1 under the bundle isomorphism \u266f : T \u2217 (M ) \u2192 T M of\nindex lifting induced by the metric g. The inverse isomorphism (index lowering)\nwill be conventionally denoted by \u266d : T (M ) \u2192 T \u2217 M . We introduce the following\nvector fields: \u03bei = (\u03c9 i )\u266f \u2208 T (M ).\nLemma 1. The vectors \u03bei form a (local) basis for N .\nProof. Since g is non-degenerate, the vectors \u03bei are linearly independent and span\na subspace of T M of dimension d. For any vector \u03b7 \u2208 T M ,\n< \u03bei , \u03b7 >g = g\u03bc\u03bd \u03bei\u03bc \u03b7 \u03bd = g\u03bc\u03bd g \u03bc\u03bb \u03c9\u03bbi \u03b7 \u03bd = \u03c9\u03bdi \u03b7 \u03bd = \u03c9 i (\u03b7).\nSo the vector \u03b7 is g-orthogonal to all \u03bei if and only if \u03b7 is annihilated by each\n\u03c9 i . That is, \u03b7 \u2208 Ann(C(M )) = {\u03bb \u2208 T (M ) | \u03c9 j (\u03bb) = 0, \u2200 j \u2264 d}. Since\nAnn(C(M )) = T (S), we see that the linear span of {\u03bei }\u22a5 is T (S).\n\u0003\nDefinition 1. The curvature (Frobenius Tensor) of the \"transversal connection\"\nN is defined as the bilinear mapping\nRN : T (M ) \u00d7 T (M ) \u2192 T (S)\ndefined by\nRN (\u03b3, \u03b7) = v([h\u03b3, h\u03b7]),\n\n(1)\n\nwhere h : T (M ) \u2192 N is g-orthogonal projection onto N , and v : T (M ) \u2192 T (S) is\ng-orthogonal projection onto T (S).\nIt is known (see DeLeon, Rodrigues 1989, Sec.1.15) that N is integrable if and\nonly if the curvature RN defined above is identically zero on T M \u00d7 T M .\nRemark 1. An equivalent way to characterize the integrability of N is to use the\nstructure tensor of J. Martinet or the D. Bernard structure tensor of the annihilator\nN \u2217 \u2282 T \u2217 (M ) of the distribution N (see Libermann 1976).\n3. Integrability criteria.\nThe condition (1) is equivalent to v([\u03b3, \u03b7]) = 0, for all \u03b3, \u03b7 \u2208 N . If we write the\nvectors \u03b3, \u03b7 in terms of the basis {\u03bei }, then we have\n\u0001\nv([\u03b3 i \u03bei , \u03b7 j \u03bej ]) = v \u03b3 i (\u03bei * \u03b7 j )\u03bej \u2212 \u03b7 j (\u03bej * \u03b3 i )\u03bei + \u03b3 i \u03b7 j [\u03bei , \u03bej ]\n=\n\n\u03b3 i \u03b7 j v([\u03bei , \u03bej ]), since v(\u03bek ) = 0 \u2200 k.\n\nThus R = 0 if and only if v([\u03bei , \u03bej ]) = 0\n\nfor all i, j \u2264 d.\n\n\f4\n\nDANIEL FISH AND SERGE PRESTON\n\nConsider the linear operator A : T (M ) \u2192 T (M ) defined by the (1,1)-tensor field\nA\u03c4\u03bc = P \u03c4 \u03c3 g\u03c3\u03bc . Since g is non-degenerate we have ImA = T (S). Since each basis\nvector \u03bei \u2208 N is of the form \u03bei\u03bc = g \u03bc\u03bd \u03c9\u03bdi with \u03c9 i \u2208 kerP , we also have\nA\u03c4\u03bc \u03bei\u03bc = P \u03c4 \u03c3 g\u03c3\u03bc g \u03bc\u03bd \u03c9\u03bdi = P \u03c4 \u03bd \u03c9\u03bdi = 0.\nTherefore N \u2282 kerA, and by comparing dimensions we see that N = kerA. Notice\nthat operator A and the orthonormal projector v have the same image and kernel.\nWe conclude that\nR = 0 \u21d4 A[\u03bei , \u03bej ] = 0, \u2200 i, j \u2264 d.\nWe now prove the main result of this section.\nTheorem 1. Let \u03c9 i , 0 \u2264 i \u2264 d be a local basis for C(M ) and let (\u03c9 i )\u266f = \u03bei be\nthe corresponding local basis of N .

If the parallel translation \u2207\u03b1\u266f along the trajectories of the vector field \u03be = \u03b1\u266f\npreserves T (S), then it also preserves its g-orthogonal complement N , and hence\nthe dual to parallel translation in the cotangent bundle will preserve sub-bundle\nC(M ) = N \u266d (see Lemma 1). That is,\nP \u03c4 \u03c3 \u2207\u03b1\u266f \u03b2\u03c3 = 0\nfor any \u03b2 in C(M ). Writing this equality in the form (\u2207\u03b1\u266f P )\u03c4 \u03c3 \u03b2\u03c3 = 0 and using\nthe previous Corollary we get the result.\n\u0003\nRemark 2. Lichnerowicz's condition, i.e. the requirement that \u2207P = 0, guarantees much more than the integrability of the distribution N and, therefore, the local\nsplitting of M into a product of a symplectic leaf S and complemental manifold\nN with zero Poisson tensor. It also guarantees regularity of the Poisson structure,\nand reduction of the metric g to the block diagonal form g = gS + gN , with the\ncorresponding metrics on the symplectic leaves and maximal integral manifolds Nm\nof N being independent on the complemental variables (i.e. the metric gS on the\nsymplectic leaves is independent from the coordinates y along Nm ). Furthermore,\nthe condition \u2207P = 0 also ensures the independence of the symplectic form \u03c9S\nfrom the transversal coordinates y (see Vaisman 1994, Remark 3.11). Finally from\n\u2207gS \u03c9S = 0 follows the existence of a gS -parallel Kahler metric on the symplectic\nleaves.\nCorollary 3.

Nijenhuis Tensor. Conventionally the integrability of different geometrical\nstructures presented by a (1, 1)-tensor field can be characterized in terms of the\ncorresponding Nijenhuis tensor. Thus, it is interesting to see the relation of our\ncriteria presented above to the nullity of the corresponding Nijenhuis tensor.\nDefinition 2. Given any (1, 1) tensor field J on M , there exists a tensor field NJ\nof type (1, 2) (called the Nijenhuis torsion of J) defined as follows (see DeLeon and\nRodrigues 1989, Sec.1.10):\nNJ (\u03be, \u03b7) = [J\u03be, J\u03b7] \u2212 J[J\u03be, \u03b7] \u2212 J[\u03be, J\u03b7] + J 2 [\u03be, \u03b7]\nfor all vector fields \u03be, \u03b7.\nIf J is an almost product structure, i.e. J 2 = Id, then NJ = 0 is equivalent to\nthe integrability of J. In fact, given such a structure on M , we can define projectors\nv = (1/2)(Id + J) and h = (1/2)(Id \u2212 J) onto complementary distributions Im(v)\nand Im(h) in T M such that at each point x \u2208 M ,\nTx M = Im(v)x \u2295 Im(h)x .\nIt is known (see DeLeon and Rodrigues 1989, Sec.3.1) that J is integrable if and\nonly if Im(v) and Im(h) are integrable, and that the following equivalences hold:\nNJ = 0 \u2194 Nh = 0 \u2194 Nv = 0.\nConsider now the two complementary distributions T (S) and N discussed above.\nSuppose that v is g-orthogonal projection onto the distribution T (S), and h is gorthogonal projection onto N . Applying these results in this setting we see that\nthat the distribution N is integrable if and only if Nv = 0.\nSince v 2 = v, and since any \u03be \u2208 T (M ) can be expressed as \u03be = v\u03be + h\u03be, we have\nNv (\u03be, \u03b7)\n\n=\n\n[v\u03be, v\u03b7] \u2212 v[v\u03be, v\u03b7 + h\u03b7] \u2212 v[v\u03be + h\u03b3, v\u03b7] + v[v\u03b3 + h\u03b3, v\u03b7 + h\u03b7]\n\n=\n=\n\n(Id \u2212 v)[v\u03be, v\u03b7] + v[h\u03b3, h\u03b7]\nh[v\u03be, v\u03b7] + v[h\u03be, h\u03b7]\n\nfor all \u03be and \u03b7 in T (M ). Since T (S) is integrable we have [v\u03be, v\u03b7] \u2208 T (S), and so\nNv (\u03be, \u03b7) = v[h\u03be, h\u03b7].\nAs a result, we can restrict \u03be and \u03b7 to be sections of the distribution N to get the\nfollowing integrability condition for N in terms of (1,1)-tensor v:\n\u2217\n\nN is integrable \u2194 Nv (\u03be, \u03b7)\u03bc = v\u03bd\u03bc [\u03be, \u03b7]\u03bd = \u2212\u2202j v\u03bd\u03bc (\u03be \u2227 \u03b7)j\u03bd = 0,\nfor all \u03bc and all \u03be, \u03b7 \u2208 \u0393(N ). The equality (\u2217) on the right is proved in the same\nway as the similar result for the action of P \u03c4 \u03c3 in the proof of statement (3) of\nTheorem 1.\nThe tensor A\u03bc\u03bd = g\u03bd\u03c3 P \u03c3\u03bc discussed above can be considered to be a linear\nmapping from T (M ) to T (S), but since A is not idempotent, it does not define a\nprojection. However, the tensors A and v, having the same kernel and image are\nrelated in the sense that the integrability of N is also equivalent to\nA\u03bc\u03bd [\u03be, \u03b7]\u03bd = \u2212\u2202\u03c3 A\u03bc\u03bd (\u03be \u2227 \u03b7)\u03c3\u03bd = 0,\nfor all sections \u03be and \u03b7 of the distribution N (using the same argument as for the\ntensor v\u03c3\u03bc above).\nIn fact, since the linear mappings A, v of Tm (M ) have the same kernel and image\nfor all m \u2208 M , there exists a (non-unique) pure gauge automorphism D : T (M ) \u2192\n\n\f8\n\nDANIEL FISH AND SERGE PRESTON\n\nT (M ) of the tangent bundle (i.e. inducing the identity mapping of the base M and,\ntherefore, defined by a smooth (1,1)-tensor field D\u03bd\u03bc ) such that A\u03bc\u03c3 = D\u03bd\u03bc v\u03c3\u03bd .

Case of a symplectic fibration. Here we discuss a situation that demonstrates that the very possibility to choose a global metric g such that the distribution Ng is integrable is determined mostly by the topological properties of the\n\"bundle\" of leaves of the symplectic foliation, i.e. the existence of a zero curvature\nEhresmann connection.\nA topologically simple (with regard to the transversal structure) example of a\nregular Poisson manifold is a symplectic fibration: a fiber bundle (M, \u03c0, B) such\nthat every fiber Sb = \u03c0 \u22121 (b) is endowed with a symplectic structure \u03c9S = \u03c9b .\nEach fiber is symplectomorphic to the model symplectic manifold (F, \u03c9), and the\ntransition functions of a trivialization of this bundle are symplectic isomorphisms on\nthe fibers (see Guillemin et al 1996, Ch.1). The inverse Pb =V\u03c9b\u22121 of the V\nsymplectic\nform on each symplectic fiber defines, via the embedding T (Sb ) \u2192 T (M ), a\nsmooth (2,0)-tensor field P , i.e. a regular Poisson structure on M .\nThe distribution Ng , which is g-orthogonal to the fibers Sb with respect to some\n(pseudo-)Riemannian metric on M (with the condition that the restriction of g to\nthe fiber Sb is non-degenerate), defines an Ehresmann connection \u0393g on the bundle\n(M, \u03c0, B). Integrability of the distribution Ng (i.e. integrability of the connection\n\u0393g ) means that the curvature (Frobenius tensor) of the connection \u0393g is zero.\nOn the bundle (M, \u03c0, B) of a symplectic fibration there is a special class of symplectic connections \u0393 distinguished by the condition that the holonomy mappings\nare symplectic diffeomorphisms of the fibers. It is proved in Guillemin et al 1996,\nCh. I that if F is compact, connected and simply connected, then for such a connection there exists a closed 2-form \u03c9\u0393 on M whose restrictions to any fiber Sb coincide\nwith \u03c9b , and such that the orthogonal complement \u03c9\u0393 of the tangent space Tm (S)\nto the fiber passing through a point m \u2208 M is exactly the horizontal subspace\nHor\u0393 (m) of the connection \u0393 at the point m. The curvature of the connection\n\u0393, which measures the degree of \"non-integrability\" of the distribution Hor\u0393 , is\ndetermined by the form \u03c9\u0393 through the curvature identity proved in Guillemin et\nal 1996, Ch. I. Namely, let v1 , v2 be two arbitrary vector fields on B and denote\nby v1\u266f , v2\u266f their horizontal lifts to vector fields in M . Then the curvature of \u0393 is the\nvertical (i.e. restricted to the fiber) part of the 1-form i[v\u266f ,v\u266f ] \u03c9\u0393 , and one has the\n1 2\nequality\n\u2212div\u266f iv\u266f \u03c9\u0393 = i[v\u266f ,v\u266f ] \u03c9\u0393 mod B\n1\n\n2\n\n1\n\n2\n\nwhere mod B means \"restricted to the fiber\". This restriction is zero if and only if\nthe function H = iv\u266f iv\u266f \u03c9\u0393 is constant along the fibers Sb . Then H = \u03c0 \u2217 h for\n1\n2\nsome h \u2208 C \u221e (B) is a Casimir function for the Poisson structure on M constructed\nas described above.\nHaving a connection \u0393 (symplectic or not) available on the bundle (M, \u03c0, B), one\ncan define a whole class of (pseudo-)Riemannian metrics for which the orthogonal\ncomplement of T (S) will coincide with Hor\u0393 . Namely, we take a metric gS,b on\nTm (S) smoothly depending on the point b. Then we take an arbitrary metric gB on\nthe base B and lift it to the horizontal subspaces of \u0393. The metric g on the total\nspace of the bundle M is now defined by the condition of orthogonality of T (S) and\nHor\u0393 . The projection \u03c0 : M \u2192 B becomes a (pseudo-)Riemannian submersion\n(see Cheeger and Ebin 1975). There is a relation between the curvatures of gB , g\nand the curvature of the connection \u0393 (O'Neill formula, see Cheeger and Ebin 1975,\n3.20). Let m \u2208 M, b = \u03c0(m), X, Y \u2208 Tb (B) be two arbitrary tangent vectors at b,\nand let X\u0304, \u0232 \u2208 Hor\u0393 (m) \u2282 Tm (M ) be their horizontal lifts at the point m. Then\n\n\f12\n\nDANIEL FISH AND SERGE PRESTON\n\nfor the sectional curvatures K of the metric gB and K\u0304 of g one has\n3\nKb (X, Y ) = K\u0304m (X\u0304, \u0232 ) + k[X\u0304, \u0232 ]vert (m)k2gS m ,\n4\nwhere vert means taking the vertical component of the bracket of horizontal lifts\nto a neighborhood of m of arbitrary vector fields in B having values X, Y at the\npoint b. Thus, the curvature of the connection \u0393 measures the difference between\nthe sectional curvatures of the metric gB and its horizontal lift to the distribution\nHor\u0393 .\nIt is easy to construct examples of bundles which do not allow integrable Ehresmann connections using the following arguments. Suppose that a bundle (M, \u03c0, B)\nwith a simply-connected base B allows an integrable Ehresmann connection \u0393. The\nholonomy group of the connection \u0393 is discrete (by the Ambrose-Singer Theorem,\nsince the curvature is zero) and, therefore, any maximal integral submanifold (say,\nV ) of \u0393 is a covering of B. Since B is simply-connected, the projection \u03c0 : V \u2192 B\nis a diffeomorphism. Pick a point b \u2208 B. Then every maximal integral manifold\nintersects the fiber Fb at one point, defining in this way a smooth diffeomorphism\nq : M \u2192 Fb \u2243 F smoothly depending on b. Together with the projection \u03c0 this\nmapping defines a trivialization (\u03c0, q) : M \u2192 B \u00d7 F of the bundle (M, \u03c0, B).\nThis proves the following\nProposition 1. Let (M, \u03c0, B; (F, \u03c9)) be a symplectic fibration with the model symplectic fiber (F, \u03c9), base B and the total Poisson space M . If the bundle (M, \u03c0, B) is\ntopologically non-trivial, then the Poisson manifold (M, P = \u03c9b\u22121 cannot be endowed\nwith a (global) pseudo-Riemannian metric g such that the orthogonal distribution\nNg would be integrable.\nThus, if we take an arbitrary nontrivial bundle over a simply-connected manifold B, it can not have a nonlinear connection of zero curvature. An example is\nthe tangent bundle (T (CP (2)), \u03c0, CP (2)) over B = CP (2), where the standard\nsymplectic structure on B = CP (2) determines a (constant) symplectic structure\nalong the fibers.\n6. Examples of Integrability: Linear Poisson structure\nLet g be a real n-dimensional Lie algebra with a basis {e\u03bc } and Lie bracket\n[e\u03bc , e\u03bd ] = c\u03c3\u03bc\u03bd e\u03c3 . Let G be a connected Lie group with Lie algebra g. The Killing\nform K on g is the invariant, symmetric, bilinear form defined by\nK(x, y) = T r(ad(x) \u25e6 ad(y)), K\u03bc\u03bd = T r(ade\u03bc * ade\u03bd ),\nwhere adv (X) = [v, X], X \u2208 g (see Bourbaki 1968, Ch.3).

The cotangent bundle T \u2217 (g\u2217 ) takes the form T \u2217 (g\u2217 ) \u2243 g\u2217 \u00d7 g.\nThe action of G induced by Ad\u2217 (G) on T (g\u2217 ) \u2243 g\u2217 \u00d7 g\u2217 is Ad\u2217 (g) \u00d7 Ad\u2217 (g),\nwhile the dual action on the cotangent bundle T \u2217 (g\u2217 ) \u2243 g\u2217 \u00d7 g takes the form\nAd\u2217 (g) \u00d7 Ad(g). In particular, the action on the second factor coincides with the\nadjoint action of G on g. Below we will be using these identifications without\nfurther comments.\nIf g is a real semi-simple Lie algebra, the Killing form K is non-degenerate and\ncan be used to identify g with g\u2217 . Under this identification, the adjoint action of\nG corresponds to the co-adjoint and, correspondingly, adjoint orbits correspond to\nco-adjoint ones. Thus, one can translate the linear Poisson structure to the Lie\nalgebra g and use the available information about the (singular) foliation of g by\nthe adjoint orbits (see Warner 1972, Sec.1.3) to study the K-orthogonal distribution\nNK defined by the (pseudo-Riemannian) Killing metric K.\n\n6.1. Compact semi-simple Lie algebra. Consider the case when g is a compact\nreal semi-simple Lie algebra, i.e. the Lie algebra of a compact semi-simple Lie\ngroup. Then the Killing form K is negative definite, and, therefore, \u2212K is an\ninvariant Riemannian metric on g (see Knapp, 1996, Ch.4).\nThe canonical isomorphism Tx\u2217 (g\u2217 ) \u2243 g defined above allows us to consider the\nKilling form \u2212K\u03bc\u03bd on g as a covariant metric g \u03bc\u03bd on g\u2217 . Basic vectors e\u03bc \u2208 g\nare identified with the covectors d\u03bb\u03bc in g\u2217 . To be consistent with the upper/lower\nindices duality we will denote these basic covectors in g\u2217 by e\u03bc .\nRecall that we have the following condition (see (3) in Theorem 1) for the gorthogonal space N to be integrable.\nN is integrable \u21d4 g \u03b3\u03b1 \u2207\u03b3 P \u03c4 \u03c3 (\u03c9\u03b1 \u03b7\u03c3 \u2212 \u03c9\u03c3 \u03b7\u03b1 ) = 0, \u2200\u03c4,\nwhere \u03c9 and \u03b7 are any two elements in the kernel of P . Using this condition we\ncan prove the following\nTheorem 4. Let g be a compact semi-simple Lie algebra and let M = g\u2217reg with\nthe standard linear Lie-Poisson structure. Let g be the inverse to the metric on g\ngiven by the restriction of the negative Killing form on g.

The distribution N on the manifold g\u2217reg for a compact semi-simple\nLie algebra g is integrable. Furthermore, via the identification of g\u2217 with g as\nabove, each connected component (Weyl Chamber) of the Lie algebra t of a maximal\ntorus T \u2282 G is a maximal integral surface of the distribution N at each point x.\nProof. Let t be one of the maximal commutative subalgebras of g (the Lie algebra\nof a maximal torus T \u2282 G).\nRecall that the root decomposition delivers the K-orthogonal decomposition of\ng:\nX\ng=t\u2295\ng\u03b1 ,\n\u03b1\u2208\u03a3\n\nwhere \u03a3 is the root system of the couple (gc , tc ) and g\u03b1 = g \u2229 g\u03b1\nc.\nAny connected component (Weyl Chamber) of t is a maximal integral surface of\nthe distribution N at each regular point x since t is K-orthogonal to the tangent\nspace of each adjoint orbit (symplectic leaf) in M = g\u2217reg (see Knapp, 1996, Ch.4)\n(\n)\nX\n\u03b1\nTx (Ad(G)X) = x +\ng\n.\n\u03b1\u2208\u03a3\n\nThrough each point x \u2208 g there passes at least one such subspace t, and a point x\nis regular if and only if this t, containing x is unique. This proves the statement. \u0003\n6.2. Non-compact semi-simple Lie algebras. Let G be a connected real semisimple Lie Group with Lie Algebra g. As in the compact case, symplectic orbits\nof g with this structure are exactly adjoint orbits of G, but in contrast to the\ncompact case, an adjoint orbit of X \u2208 g is closed iff X is semi-simple, i.e ad(X) is\nsemi-simple (see Warner 1972, Prop.1.3.5.5). The subset g\u2032 of regular elements,\ni.e. semi-simple elements X with centralizer X g of minimal dimension (see Warner\n1972, Sec.1.3.4) endowed with the induced Poisson structure is an open and dense\n\n\fON THE INTEGRABILITY\n\n15\n\nsubset of g. Its structure is as follows. Let j be a Cartan subalgebra of g. Let\nj\u2032 = j \u2229 g\u2032 . Put\n[\ng(j) =\nAd(x)j\u2032 ,\nx\u2208G\n\nwhere G = Int(g) is the adjoint group of g. Then (see Warner, Prop. 1.3.4.1),\n[\ng\u2032 =\ng(jl ),\nl\n\nwhere jl for 1 \u2264 l \u2264 q are representatives of (a finite number of) conjugacy classes\nof Cartan subalgebras of g.\nNow, pick 1 \u2264 l \u2264 q and let g = k \u2295 \u03bc be the Cartan decomposition of g such\nthat\njl = jl k \u2295 jl\n\n\u03bc\n\n= jl \u2229 k \u2295 jl \u2229 \u03bc\n\nis the direct sum decomposition of the Cartan subalgebra jl into compact and\nnoncompact parts. It is known that the Killing form K is positive definite on \u03bc\nand negative definite on k. Using the Cartan decomposition of jl above, we see\nthat the restriction of the Killing form to the subspace X + jl \u2282 TX (g), and all\nits\nhas constant signature and is non-degenerate at all points X \u2208\nS conjugates,\n\u2032\nx\u2208G Ad(x)j . Therefore, the same is true for its K-orthogonal complement. The\nrestricted root decomposition\nX\ng = jl \u2295\ng\u03b1 ,\n\u03b1\u2208\u03a3\n\nwhere \u03a3 is the system of (restricted) roots of the pair (g, jl \u03bc ) can be used to show\nthat X + jl is the K-orthogonal complement to TX (Ad(G)X) in TX (g).\nWe call an element \u03bb \u2208 g\u2217 \u2217-regular if the corresponding element X\u03bb + i\u22121\nK \u03bb of\ng is regular. Then, arguments similar to those in the previous subsection can be\nused to prove the following\nProposition 2. Let g be a real semi-simple Lie algebra. Consider the dual space\n(g\u2217 , P ) with its linear Poisson structure. Endow g\u2217 with the (pseudo)-Riemannian\nmetric K \u2217 induced by the Killing form on g. Let M = g\u2217reg be the (open and dense)\nsubmanifold of g\u2217 of co-adjoint orbits (symplectic leaves) of \u2217-regular elements.\nThen the restriction of K \u2217 to each orbit in M has constant signature and is nondegenerate. The K \u2217 -orthogonal distribution N to the symplectic leaves is integrable.\nMaximal integral submanifolds of N are images under the identification iK : g \u2261 g\u2217\nof (the regular parts of ) Cartan subalgebras of g.\nRemark 3. We had to add the condition of semi-simplicity of an element because of\nthe presence in g of a principal nilpotent orbit of the same maximal dimension. The\nrestriction of the Killing form to such orbits is degenerate. For example, consider\nthe Lie algebra g = sl(2, R). In addition to the closed semi-simple adjoint orbits of\nelliptic and hyperbolic elements, there is also the adjoint nilpotent orbit in g of the\nsame dimension 2.\n6.3. Dual to the Euclidian Lie algebra e(3). Let g be the Lie algebra se(3) of\nthe group of proper Euclidian motions in R3 , let g\u2217 be its dual, and let M = g\u2217reg\nbe the (open, connected and dense) subspace of 4d co-adjoint orbits in g\u2217 .\n\n\f16\n\nDANIEL FISH AND SERGE PRESTON\n\nThe Killing form of the Lie algebra se(3) is degenerate, so we identify g\u2217 with g\nvia the Euclidean scalar product (see Marsden and Ratiu 1994, Ch.8). Elements of\ng can be represented as vectors (x, p) in so(3) \u2295 R3 with the Lie bracket defined as\n[(x, p), (x\u2032 , p\u2032 )] = (x \u00d7 x\u2032 , x \u00d7 p\u2032 + p \u00d7 x\u2032 ).\nWe can consider vectors x in s0(3) to be skew-symmetric matrices due to the\nisomorphism\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n0\n\u2212x3 x2\n0\n\u2212x1 \uf8f8 .\nx \u2192 x\u0302 = \uf8ed x3\n\u2212x2 x1\n0\n\nThe canonical linear Poisson structure on M\nPoisson tensor has the form\n\u0012\nx\u0302\nP (x, p) =\n\u2212p\u0302\n\n\u2282 g\u2217 \u2243 g has, in this notation, the\n\n\u0013\np\u0302\n.\n0\n\nCasimir functions of this structure are c1 = x * p and c2 = p * p. The subspace of\nregular (4d) co-adjoint orbits is, in this notation, defined by the condition c2 (x, p) 6=\n0.\nFor any y we have x \u00d7 y = \u2212yx\u0302 = x\u0302yT . This allows us to express the adjoint\naction on se(3) as\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0177 0\nad(y,q) (x, p) = \u2212(x\u0177, p\u0177 + xq\u0302) =\n(x, p)T .\nq\u0302 \u0177\nWe want to construct a symmetric (2, 0) tensor g that is invariant under the\nadjoint action of the Lie algebra that we can possibly use as a Riemannian metric.\nSuppose then, that we have a non-degenerate scalar product g0 defined on g by a\nconstant symmetric matrix:\n\u0012\n\u0013\nA B\n\u2032\n\u2032\n< (x, p), (x , p ) >g0 = (x, p)\n(x\u2032 , p\u2032 )T .\nBT C\nWe extend g0 to a covariant metric g on M by setting g(x, p) = g0 . We would like\nto choose this metric to be invariant under the co-adjoint action. Thus, g should\nsatisfy the equation (we use the identification of the tangent and cotangent bundles\nto g\u2217 as above)\n< ad(y.q) (x, p), (x\u2032 , p\u2032 ) >g + < (x, p), ad(y,q) (x\u2032 , p\u2032 ) >g = 0.\nSince this must hold for arbitrary vectors (x, p) and (x\u2032 , p\u2032 ) in g, we have the\nfollowing condition on g.\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012 T\n\u0013\n\u0177 0\nq\u0302T\n\u0177\n*g + g*\n= 0.\nq\u0302 \u0177\n0 \u0177T\nThis condition is equivalent to the following system of equations:\n1)\n2)\n\nA\u0177 \u2212 \u0177A + B q\u0302 \u2212 q\u0302B T = 0\nB \u0177 \u2212 \u0177B \u2212 q\u0302C = 0\n\n3)\n\nB T \u0177 \u2212 \u0177B T + C q\u0302 = 0\n\n4)\n\nC \u0177 \u2212 \u0177C = 0.\n\n\fON THE INTEGRABILITY\n\n17\n\nSince these equations must be valid for arbitrary \u0177 and q\u0302, it is easy to see that the\nmetric g must be of the form\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03b1I \u03b2I\ng=\n.\n(10)\n\u03b2I 0\nThus, the only ad-invariant (constant) metrics on M are those having this special\nform. Note that such a metric cannot be Riemannian (seepZefran et al 1996). In\nfact, the distinct eigenvalues of such a metric are \u03bbi = (\u03b1 \u00b1 \u03b12 + 4\u03b2 2 )/2, i = 1, 2\n(of multiplicity 3 each). The product of these eigenvalues is \u03bb1 \u03bb2 = \u2212\u03b2 2 \u2264 0. Thus,\nif non-degenerate (i.e. \u03b2 6= 0), the metric g has signature (3, 3).\nLet T(x,p) (S) be the space tangent to the symplectic leaf passing through the\npoint (x, p) \u2208 M . Then we can define its g \u22121 -orthogonal complement N(x,p) , and\na g \u22121 -orthogonal distribution N on M . The covectors \u03c9 1 = dc1 = (p, x) and\n\u2217\n\u03c9 2 = dc2 = (0, p) form a basis for the subspace Cm (M ) = ker(Pm ) \u2282 Tm\n(M ) \u2261 g,\n1 \u266f\n2 \u266f\nand the tangent vectors \u03be1 = (\u03c9 ) and \u03be2 = (\u03c9 ) form, at each point m = (x, p),\na basis for Nm . We have\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u03b1p + \u03b2x\n\u03b2p\n\u03be1 =\n, \u03be2 =\n\u03b2p\n0\n\nConsider the case \u03b1 = 0. It is easy to see that, in the basis \u03bei , the restriction of\nthe metric g to the subspace Nm of the distribution N at a point m = (x, p) has\nthe form\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2c1 (x, p) c2 (x, p)\ng=\n.\nc2 (x, p)\n0\n\nSince det(g) = \u2212(p * p)2 , this restriction is non-degenerate on the subset of regular\n(4d) co-adjoint orbits. On the distribution N the metric g has signature (1,1).\nThus, on the tangent spaces T (S) of symplectic foliation, g has signature (2,2) at\nall (regular) points, and results of Sec.3 are applicable here.\nHowever, the methods from that section are not necessary in this case. Since we\nhave explicit expressions for the vectors \u03bei , and for the tensors P and g, it is easy to\ncheck the integrability of N directly. The distribution N will be integrable if and\nonly if the Lie bracket [\u03be1 , \u03be2 ] of vector fields \u03bei considered as g-values functions on\nM remains in N .\nProposition 3. For any choice of (constant) non-degenerate ad-invariant metric\ng on the subspace M = g\u2217reg of 4d co-adjoint orbits of dual space e(3)\u2217 of the 3-d\nEuclidian lie algebra e(3) , the distribution N is integrable. For metrics (8) with\n\u03b1 = 0, the maximal integral submanifold passing through a point (x, p) is presented,\nin parametrical form as\n\u0012 T\u0013\n\u0012 T\u0013\nt p\ns x\n.\n+e\n(s, t) \u2192 e\n0\npT\nProof.

Conclusion\nIn this work we discuss necessary and sufficient conditions for the distribution N\non a regular Poisson manifold (M, P ) defined as orthogonal complement of tangent\nto symplectic leaves with respect to some (pseudo-)Riemannian metric g on M to\nbe integrable. We present these conditions in different forms, including a condition\nin terms of a symmetry of Christoffel coefficients of the Levi-Civita connection\nof the metric g and get some corollaries, one of which specifies the part of the\nLichnerowicz (\u2207P = 0) condition ensuring integrability of N (see Vaisman 1994,\n3.11). We present examples of non-integrable N (the model 4d case and the case of\na nontrivial symplectic fibration). We prove integrability of N on the regular part\nof the dual space g\u2217 of a real semi-simple Lie algebra g and the same in the case of\nthe 3d Euclidian Lie algebra e(3) with a linear Poisson structure.\nAs the case of a symplectic fibration shows, the integrability of N is possible\nonly on a topologically trivial bundle (trivial transversal topology). Thus, it would\nbe interesting to study maximal integral submanifolds of N in the case of nontrivial\nsymplectic bundles. In particular, it would be interesting to get conditions on the\nmetric g under which these maximal integral submanifolds would have maximal\npossible dimension. Probably the methods of Cartan-Kahler theory (see Bryant et.\nal., 1991) can be employed to investigate these questions.\nThe authors would like to express their gratitude to Professor V. Guillemin for\nhis interest in this work.\n8. References\n1. A.Bloch, P.S.Krishnaprasad, J.Marsden, and T.Ratiu, The Euler-Poincare\nEquations and Double Bracket Dissipation, Comm. Math. Phys.
