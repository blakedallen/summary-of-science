According to the baryon\ndensity determined by Wilkinson microwave anisotropy\nprobe (WMAP)[1], the primary abundances for 6 Li and\n7\nLi predicted by standard BBN (SBBN) model deviate clearly from the observations of the metal-poor\nhalo stars[2], where the lithium abundances exhibit a\n\"plateau\" behavior[3]. Several investigations for both astrophysical observation and nucleosynthesis calculation\nhave been attempted to explain the large discrepancies,\nbut none of them has been successful up to now. In addition, due to the difference between the depletion speeds\nof 6 Li and 7 Li in stars, the 6 Li/7 Li ratio could stand for\na measure of the time scale for stellar evolution. In the\nabove scenario, 6 Li(n,\u03b3)7 Li is believed to be one of the\nimportant reactions in the SBBN network[4, 5], its reaction rates would affect the abundances of both 6 Li and\n7\nLi.\nThe cross sections of 6 Li(n,\u03b3)7 Li at astrophysically relevant energies are most likely dominated by the E1 transitions into the ground and first exited states in 7 Li.\nTo date, only one direct measurement of the 6 Li(n,\u03b3)7 Li\ncross sections at stellar energies has been performed[6].\nThe cross sections can also be calculated by the direct capture model with the spectroscopic factors of\n7\nLi=6 Li\u2297n extracted from the neutron transfer reactions. In the previous studies, the spectroscopic factors\nwere mostly derived by 6 Li(d, p)7 Li and 7 Li(p, d)6 Li\nreactions[7\u201311], the results are correlative with the neutron spectroscopic factor of deuteron. Thus, it is highly\ndesired to extract the spectroscopic factors through a self-\n\n\u2217 Supported\n\nby the the National Basic Research Programme of\nChina under Grant No. 2007CB815003, the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant Nos.10675173, 10720101076,\n10735100 and 10975193.\n\u2020 Electronic address: junsu@iris.ciae.ac.cn\n\ncontained reaction without third-participant, which can\nprovide an independent verification.\nThe elastic-transfer reaction is a good tool to extract\nthe single nucleon spectroscopic factors, which has been\nused to determine the spectroscopic factor of 9 Be=8 Li\u2297p\nwith 9 Be(8 Li,9 Be)8 Li reaction[12]. In such an approach,\nthe events from elastic scattering and elastic-transfer reaction can not be distinguished, but the theoretical calculation shows that their mutual contributions at the respective forward angles are negligibly small. As a result, the effective differential cross sections at forward\nangles of the two processes can be obtained respectively.\nThe obvious advantages of this approach are (i) the elastic scattering and elastic-transfer reaction have the same\nentrance and exit channels, the spectroscopic factor can\nbe derived by one set of optical potential deduced from\nthe elastic scattering and (ii) the elastic-transfer reaction does not involve third participant in the entrance\nand exit channels, and thus conduces to the reduction of\nexperimental result uncertainty.\nFor the above reasons, we chose the 7 Li(6 Li,7 Li)6 Li\nelastic-transfer reaction to extract the spectroscopic factors of the 7 Li=6 Li\u2297n. This reaction has been measured\nin 1998 at Elab =9-40 MeV[13], unfortunately the minimum angle reached in that experiment was about 30\u25e6 in\nthe center of mass frame (for transfer process), that was\nnot suitable to derive the spectroscopic factor. In present\nwork, we have measured the angular distributions of the\n7\nLi(6 Li,6 Li)7 Li elastic scattering and 7 Li(6 Li,7 Lig.s. )6 Li,\n7\nLi(6 Li,7 Li0.48 )6 Li transfer reactions at Ec.m.=23.7 MeV.\nThe neutron spectroscopic factors for the ground and first\nexited states in 7 Li were determined by comparing the experimental results with the distorted-wave Born approximation (DWBA) calculations, and then used to calculate\nthe cross sections and astrophysical rates of 6 Li(n,\u03b3)7 Li\ndirect capture reaction.\nThe experiment was carried out at the Beijing HI-13\ntandem accelerator.

The Faraday cup covered an angle range of \u00b16\u25e6 and\nconfined the attainable minimum angle in the measurement. The reaction products were focused and separated\nby Q3D magnetic spectrograph. The accepted solid angle of Q3D was set to be 0.23 mSr for a better angular\nresolution. A two-dimensional position sensitive silicon\ndetector (PSSD) was set at the focal plane of Q3D, the XY information from PSSD enabled the products emitted\ninto the accepted solid angle of Q3D to be fully recorded,\nand the corresponding energy signals were used to remove\nthe impurities with the same magnetic rigidity. The absolute differential cross sections were determined by normalizing the measurements of the 7 Li(6 Li,6 Li)7 Li elastic\nscattering and the 7 Li(6 Li,7 Lig.s. )6 Li, 7 Li(6 Li,7 Li0.48 )6 Li\ntransfer reactions to the elastic scattering of 6 Li on the\ngold target at \u03b8lab = 25\u25e6 .\nThe experiment setup was tested beforehand by measuring the angular distribution of 12 C(7 Li,7 Li)12 C elastic\nscattering at Elab =36 MeV.

For the first exited\nstate in 7 Li, only the neutron transfer to the 1p3/2 orbit was considered because the contribution of 1p1/2 orbit is merely about 4%[17], then the spectroscopic factor\nof 7 Li0.48 =6 Li\u2297n was derived to be 0.90 \u00b1 0.09. The\nspectroscopic factors obtained in several theoretical and\nexperimental investigations are listed in Table II, our results agree well with the theoretical calculation[17\u201320]\nand the experimental data[8, 9].\nAt low energies of astrophysical interest, the\n6\nLi(n,\u03b3)7 Li direct capture cross sections are dominated\nby the E1 transition from incoming s-wave to the bound\nstate, the contribution of d-wave neutrons is negligible.\nIn the computation we used the code RADCAP[21] and\nWoods-Saxon form potential with the standard geometrical parameters. The potential depths of the 7 Li bound\nstates were adjusted to reproduce the neutron binding\nenergies of its ground and first excited states, respectively. For the scattering potential, the depth can be\nfixed by fitting the well measured 6 Li(p,\u03b3)7 Be cross sections at low energies[22] because the difference between\nn+6 Li and p+6 Li potentials is only a Coulomb modification of depth, which is given by \u2206V = 0.4Z/A1/3 [23].\n\nGround state\nFirst exited state\nSum\n\n100\n\nS(E) factors (ev b)\n\nFIG. 3: Angular distribution of 7 Li(6 Li, 7 Lig.s. )6 Li and\n7\nLi(6 Li, 7 Li0.48 )6 Li at Ec.m. =23.7 MeV together with the\nDWBA calculations normalized to the first three data at forward angles.

The neutron spectroscopic factors\nof 7 Li derived above were correspondingly taken as the\nproton spectroscopic factors for the ground and first exited states in 7 Be owing to the charge symmetry. Here,\nthe depth of scattering potential was constrained to be\n41.3 \u00b1 2.0 MeV in reproducing the experimental data.\nThe calculated astrophysical 6 Li(p,\u03b3)7 Be S(E) factors are\nshown in Fig. 4 together with the experimental results.\nIn addition to a good agreement between the calculated\nand measured total S(E) factors, our calculation also indicates that the contributions of ground and first exited\nstates are about 63% and 37%, respectively, which are\nvery close to the experimental values 61% and 39%[22].\nConsidering the Coulomb modification, the scattering\npotential depth of n+6 Li was chosen to be 40.6 \u00b1 2.0\nMeV. Then the 6 Li(n,\u03b3)7 Lig.s. and 6 Li(n,\u03b3)7 Li0.48 cross\nsections were calculated using the spectroscopic factors\nand optical potentials extracted above, and compared\nwith the experimental data[6], as shown in Fig. 5.
