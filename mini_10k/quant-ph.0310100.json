It is based\non the idea of minimal entropy production in a locally distinguishable basis measurement. It is\nshown to be a relative entropy distance from a set of ensembles. For bipartite ensembles, which\nspan the whole bipartite Hilbert space, the measure is bounded below by average relative entropy of\nentanglement. We naturally obtain a monotonicity axiom for any measure of quantum correlation\nof ensembles. We evaluate this measure for certain cases. Subsequently we use this measure to\npropose a complementarity relation between our measure and the accessible information obtainable\nabout the ensemble under local operations. The measure along with the monotonicity axiom are\nwell-defined even for the case of a single system, where the complementarity relation is seen to be\nyet another face of the \"Heisenberg uncertainty relation\".\n\nQuantifying quantum correlation of states is a deeply\nstudied problem [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] in quantum information.\nSeveral measures has been proposed. Prominent among\nthem are distillable entanglement [1, 6], entanglement of\nformation [1], relative entropy of entanglement [2], etc.\nHowever to our knowledge, the problem of quantification of quantum correlation of an ensemble of states has\nnever been studied. In this paper we propose first measure of quantum correlation (Q) of an ensemble of states.\nA trivial way to quantify quantum correlation of an ensemble of states is to take an average of an individual\nproperty of the constituent states in the ensemble. E.g.,\none could take the average entanglement of formation\n[1] of the ensemble states. However such an averaging\nover a property of the individual states cannot capture\nthe complexity of the ensemble as a whole. To take into\naccount the structure of the ensemble as a whole, the\nmeasure must depend on the ensemble as a whole. A\nsimple measure of quantum correlation of multiparty ensembles could be the difference D between the globally\naccessible information and the locally accessible information. However accessible information is an operationally\nuseful quantity, and one aim of defining Q is to estimate\naccessible information under different sets of operations.\nMoreover D vanishes for single-party ensembles, whereas\nQ will be seen to be nontrivial also in such cases.\nAfter defining the measure, we show that it can be\nseen as a relative entropy distance from a set of \"classical\" ensembles. For a bipartite ensemble, which spans\nthe whole bipartite Hilbert space, we show that measure\nis bounded below by the average relative entropy of entanglement [2]. In discussing some of its properties, we\nnaturally obtain a monotonicity axiom for any measure of\nquantum correlation of ensembles. In a natural way, this\ngives us the first axiom for any measure of quantumness\nof an ensemble of a single system. We then evaluate the\nmeasure for the case of four Bell states (given with equal\nprior probabilites). We also evaluate the measure for\nother more general ensembles. We subsequently propose\na complementarity relation [7, 8] between this measure\nof quantum correlation of an ensemble and the accessible\n\ninformation obtainable about the ensemble, under the\nrelevant class of allowable operations. In the case of a\nsingle system, this complementarity is partially proven,\nand is seen to be yet another face of the \"Heisenberg\nuncertainty relation\". Importantly, both the information gathering and disturbance terms in this relation are\ninformation-theoretic, in contrast to e.g. [9].\nConsider an ensemble of bipartite states E =\nAB\n{px , |\u03c8x i }N\nx=1 , that are not necessarily orthogonal.\nOne can for example think of a source that produces the\nAB\nstate |\u03c8x i\n(belonging to the Hilbert space HA \u2297 HB )\nwith probability px (x = 1, 2, . . . , N ), and sends it to two\nfar apart parties Alice(A) and Bob(B). Here of course the\nprobabilities px are nonnegative and sum up to unity. Let\nAB\nAB\nA be the span of the states |\u03c8x i . Let {|ai i }ni=1 be\nan orthonormal basis of HA \u2297 HB . Consider the part\nAB\nof {|ai i }ni=1 which has a nonzero overlap with A [10].\nThis part (with nonzero overlap with A) can be distinguishable or indistinguishable under local operations and\nclassical communication (LOCC). Let DA be the set of all\nsuch bases {|ai iAB }ni=1 whose overlap with A is LOCCdistinguishable. Of course, n = dim{HA \u2297 HB } \u2264 N .\nThe measure of quantum correlation Q for the ensemble E is defined as the minimum entropy produced when\ndephased (measured) in a basis from DA . More precisely,\nQ(E) = min\nDA\n\nN\nX\n\nx=1\n\nn\nX\npi|x |ai i hai |).\npx S(\ni=1\n\nHere pi|x is the probability that |ai i clicks if the signal\nstate was |\u03c8x i, i.e. pi|x = | h\u03c8x |ai i |2 . S denotes the\nvon Neumann entropy, defined asPS(\u03b7) = \u2212tr\u03b7 log2 \u03b7.\nn\nSince |ai i are orthonormal, S( i=1 pi|x |ai i hai |) =\nH({pi|x }ni=1 ). Here H denotes\ndePm the Shannon entropy, m\nfined as H({qj }m\n)\n=\n\u2212\nq\nlog\nq\n,\nwhere\n{q\n}\nj j=1\n2 j\nj=1\nj=1 j\nforms a set of probabilities. Therefore\nQ(E) = min\nDA\n\nN\nX\n\npx H({pi|x }ni=1 ).\n\nx=1\n\nThe minimum is taken over all bases in DA .\n\n\f2\nIt is interesting to note that one may define Q, for\nthe ensemble E, as the minimum entropy produced when\ndephased in an arbitrary basis in HA \u2297 HB so that the\nresulting ensemble after the measurement is an LOCCdistinguishable set of states.\nIt is quite straightforward to carry over the above definition to the case of mixed ensembles. For the case of\nmixed states, one must include in the definition, a subtraction of the initial von Neumann entropy of the sig\u2032\nnal states. More precisely, consider an ensemble E =\nN\n{px , \u033aAB\nx }x=1 of bipartite signal states, which are not necessarily pure. In this case, A will denote the union of the\nfor x = 1, 2, . . . , N . The definition of\nsupports of \u033aAB\nx\nDA is then exactly the same as for pure signals. Then\n\u2032\n\nQ(E ) = min\nDA\n\nN\nX\n\nx=1\n\n\u0001\npx H({pi|x }ni=1 ) \u2212 S(\u033ax ) ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere pi|x = hai | \u033aAB\nx |ai i.\nActually, the above notion of Q as a measure of quantumness can be used in much more general situations\nthan just in the case of a system consisting of two spatially localized subsystems. Suppose that a source produces an ensemble {px , \u033ax }N\nx=1 , with the \u033ax 's defined on\nsome Hilbert space H. And as before, let A denote the\nunion of the supports of \u033ax , and let {|ai i}ni=1 be an arbitrary complete basis in H. Depending on a set of allowed\noperations, say \u039b, the nonzero overlap [10] of {|ai i}ni=1\n\u039b\nwith A may or may not be distinguishable. Let DA\nbe the\nn\nset of all bases {|ai i}i=1 for which the nonzero overlap\nwith A is distinguishable under \u039b. Then the measure\nof quantumness of the ensemble \u0393 = {px , \u033ax }N\nx=1 , with\nrespect to the set of allowed operations \u039b, is defined as\nQ(\u0393) = min\n\u039b\nDA\n\nN\nX\n\nx=1\n\n\u0001\npx H({pi|x }ni=1 ) \u2212 S(\u033ax ) ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere pi|x is, as before, the probability that |ai i clicks\ngiven that the signal was \u033ax .\nWhen the states \u033ax are bipartite states between A and\nB, with the Hilbert space H split as HA \u2297 HB , and with\nthe allowed operations being LOCC between A and B,\nwe recover the definition given in eq. (1).\nFor a multiparty ensemble {px , \u033aABC...\n}, defined on the\nx\nHilbert space HA \u2297 HB \u2297 HC \u2297 . . ., one chooses the bases\nABC... n\n{|ai i\n}i=1 spanning this Hilbert space. Then considering the set of allowed operations as LOCC between\nA, B, C, . . ., DA is the set of bases whose nonzero overlap with A is distinguishable by such LOCC operations,\nwhere A is the union of the supports of \u033aABC...\n. In this\nx\nway, we have a measure of quantum correlation of an\nensemble of multiparty states.\nImportantly, Q can be defined also for ensembles of single systems. Then Q is the quantity in eq. (2), with the\nallowed operations being all quantum mechanical operations. Consequently the dephasing is in any orthonormal\n\nbasis in H. This quantity can be interpreted as a measure\nof quantumness of the ensemble \u0393.\nWe now show that Q(\u0393) is average relative entropy\ndistance from some ensembles Pof states. We have\n\u2032\n(see eq. (2)) Q(\u0393) = min{\u03c2x\u2032 } x px [\u2212tr(\u033ax log2 \u03c2x ) +\nP\n\u2032\ntr(\u033ax log2 \u033ax )] = min\nx px S(\u033ax |\u03c2x ), so that\n\u2032\n{\u03c2x }\n\nQ(\u0393) = min\n{\u03c2x }\n\nX\n\npx S(\u033ax |\u03c2x ),\n\n(3)\n\nx\n\nP\nP\n\u2032\nwhere \u03c2x = i pi|x |ai i hai |, \u03c2x = i axi |ai i hai |, {|ai i}i\nbeing any set of states which are distinguishable under\nthe set of allowable operations \u039b, {axi }i 's being arbitrary sets of probabilities, mixing the |ai i's. S(\u033a|\u03c2) =\ntr(\u033a log2 \u033a \u2212 \u033a log2 \u03c2) is the relative entropy distance of \u033a\nfrom \u03c2. So Q is the average relative entropy distance of\nthe signal states from the \"classical\" ensembles, namely\nthe ones whose members are mixtures of distinguishable\nstates (under \u039b). Note that for a single \"classical\" ensemble, the constituent signals are mutually commuting.\nAlthough Q turns out to be a relative entropy distance,\nit has (in contrast to relative entropy of entanglement)\nan operational meaning in terms of entropy production\n(by which it is defined in eq. (1)) even for a single copy\nof the ensemble. Therefore Q is more intimately related\nto quantum correlation measure of states of [11] than to\nrelative entropy of entanglement. Note that the averaging in eq. (3) is done before the minimization, and hence\nthe measure Q can still \"feel\" the ensemble as a whole.\nConsider now the case of an ensemble of bipartite\nstates with the allowed operations being LOCC between\nthe sharing partners. Suppose also that the union of\nthe supports of the ensemble covers the whole bipartite\nHilbert space. Then a set of orthogonal states in the\nsupport (i.e. a complete orthogonal basis) is distinguishable under LOCC only if they are all product states [12].\n(Note that the opposite is not necessarily true [13].) Ensembles {\u03c2x } that are mixtures of states from the sets\n{|ai i} which are distinguishable under LOCC, but do\nnot span the complete bipartite Hilbert space, will (in\nthis case) produce infinite relative entropy distance, and\ncan therefore be ignored (cf. eq. (3)). So the relavant\nensembles that appear in formula (3) are all separable\nstates. (Again the opposite is not true.) Thus we have\nX\n\u2032\npx ER (\u033aAB\n(4)\nQ(E ) \u2265 ER =\nx ),\nx\n\n\u2032\n\n{px , \u033aAB\nx },\n\nfor the ensemble E =\nwhere we have assumed\nthat the union of the supports of the \u033aAB\nx 's cover the\nwhole bipartite Hilbert space. ER is the relative entropy\nof entanglement defined as ER (\u033aAB ) = min\u03c2 S(\u033a|\u03c2),\nwhere the minimization is over all separable states \u03c2 [2].\nAmong other things, the inequality (4) will be important\nfor evaluation of Q for certain bipartite ensembles.\nAs Q is defined in terms of von Neumann entropy, it\nwill inherit some continuity properties due to the Fannes'\n\n\f3\ninequality [14]. By definition, Q is vanishing for ensembles which are distinguishable under the allowed set of\noperations \u039b. And it is nonzero otherwise.\nIt should be noted that Q, for the case of multipartite ensembles (with the allowed operations being the\nLOCC class) can actually increase under LOCC. This\nis because one can create nonorthogonal product states\nafter starting with a multi-orthogonal product basis [15].\nNote however that Q can increase even if the output\nstates are orthogonal, as there exist ensembles of orthogonal product states which are locally indistinguishable\n[13]. Such ensembles, which by definition has nonzero\nQ, can be created by LOCC from a multi-orthogonal\nproduct basis [15], which being LOCC distinguishable\nhas by definition vanishing Q. However, from our experience with entanglement-like quantum correlation measures [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], we know that a quantum correlation\nmeasure should show some kind of monotonicity. We believe that Q, for the case of multipartite ensembles, will\nbe monotonically decreasing under LOCC operations, if\nwe do not allow tracing out as a valid operation. Note\nthat tracing out can never be useful in a distinguishing protocol. The accessible information under LOCC,\nfor an ensemble of multipartite states, is the same as\nthe accessible information under LOCC without tracing out as a valid operation. The operations that can\nbe useful in attaining the accessible information are (a)\nadding local ancillas, (b) local unitarities, (c) local dephasing (von Neumann measurement and then forgetting\nthe outcome), (d) communication of pre-dephased quantum states (classical communication). Adding the item\n(e) tracing out, will give us the whole set of LOCC. Q\nis obviously monotonically decreasing for operations (a),\n(b), and (d). We conjecture that Q is nonincreasing also\nfor local dephasing of multipartite ensembles. Therefore\nwe have a natural axiom for any measure of quantum\ncorrelation of ensembles of multipartite states, viz. it\nmust be nonincreasing under (a), (b), (c), and (d). Let\nus emphasize that the axiom holds for measures of multipartite ensembles, not only for bipartite ones. Moreover,\nnonincreasingness under addition of ancillas, unitary operations, and dephasing is in this way seen to be a natural\naxiom for any measure of quantumness of a single system.\nWe will now calculate the value of our measure for the\nensemble B consisting of the four Bell states, |\u03c6\u00b1 i =\n\u221a1 (|00i \u00b1 |11i), |\u03c8 \u00b1 i = \u221a1 (|01i \u00b1 |10i), given with\n2\n2\nequal prior probabilities. The four Bell states span the\nwhole 2 \u2297 2 Hilbert space. To find Q, we have to minimize entropy production after dephasing over all LOCCdistinguishable bases in 2 \u2297 2. Let us first dephase in the\ncomputational basis {|00i , |11i , |01i , |10i}. Suppose for\nexample, that the signal is |\u03c6+ i. Then either |00i or |11i\nclicks with equal probabilities. So the entropy produced\nis H( 12 ), where H(*) is the binary entropy function, defined as H(p) = \u2212p log2 p \u2212 (1 \u2212 p) log2 (1 \u2212 p), 0 \u2264 p \u2264 1.\n\nThe signal |\u03c6+ i is created by the source with probability\n1\n4 . The case is similar for the other signals. Therefore we\nobtain Q \u2264 4 \u00d7 41 H( 12 ) = 1. However from ineq. (4) we\nknow that this bound is saturated, as the Bell states have\nER = 1. Therefore, we have that Q = 1 for the ensemble\nof the four Bell states given with equal prior probabilities.\n\u2032\nConsider now the more general ensemble B consisting of\na |00i + b |11i, b |00i \u2212 a |11i, c |01i + d |10i, d |01i \u2212 c |10i,\ngiven with equal prior probabilities. Again a dephasing\nin the computational basis {|00i , |11i , |01i , |10i}, implies\nthat Q \u2264 21 (H(|a|2 ) + H(|c|2 )). And again saturation follows from ineq. (4), so that Q = 21 (H(|a|2 ) + H(|c|2 )).\nSimilar calculations will deliver us also the value of Q\nfor the canonical set of maximally entangled states in\nmax\nd \u2297 d, given with equal prior probabilities, viz. |\u03c8nm\ni=\nPd\u22121 2\u03c0ijn/d\n1\n\u221a\ne\n|ji\n|(j\n+\nm)mod\ndi\n(n,\nm\n=\n0,\n.\n.\n.\n,\nd\n\u2212\nj=0\nd\n1). Considering a dephasing of this basis in the computational basis, and using ineq. (4), one obtains Q = log2 d.\nQuantification of quantum correlation of an ensemble\nof states has several important potential applications.\nE.g., it can be used to obtain a complementarity relation\nwith locally accessible information (accessible information under LOCC-based measurements). For an ensemble {px , \u033aAB\nx } of bipartite states, a complementarity has\nbeen obtained between the locally accessible information\nand average shared entanglement of the ensemble states\nLOCC\n[8]. Precisely, if Iacc\ndenotes the locally accessible information for the ensemble {px , \u033aAB\nx }, then one has [8]\nLOCC\nIacc\n+ E \u2264 log2 n,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere ensemble states \u033aAB\nare\nx\nP defined on HA \u2297 HB , n =\ndim{HA \u2297 HB }, and E = x px E(\u033aAB\nx ), E being any\nasymptotic entanglement measure of bipartite states [5].\nHowever the complexity of locally accessible information in comparison to globally accessible information depends on the geometry of the ensemble, which cannot\nbe captured by taking an average of an individual property (for example, entanglement) of the ensemble states.\nConsequently, the complementarity obtained in [8] can\npotentially be made stronger if the locally accessible information is taken along with a measure of quantum correlation of an ensemble of states.\nWe conjecture that the following complementarity re\u039b\nlation holds between the accessible information, Iacc\n, for\nthe set of allowed operations \u039b, and Q, for an ensemble\n{px , \u033ax }N\nx=1 :\n\u039b\nIacc\n+ Q \u2264 log2 N.\n\n(6)\n\nAmong other things, note also the change in the righthand-side of ineq. (6) with respect to that of ineq. (5).\nIn ineq. (5), the right-hand-side is the logarithm of the\ndimension of the Hilbert space on which the signals are\ndefined. However in ineq. (6), the right-hand-side is the\nlogarithm of the number of states in the ensemble, which\n\n\f4\ncan be less than, equal to, or greater than the dimension\nof the said Hilbert space.\nN\nFor an ensemble of bipartite states, {px , \u033aAB\nx }x=1 , the\nproposed complementarity is\nLOCC\nIacc\n+ Q \u2264 log2 N.\n\n(7)\n\nNote that due to ineq. (4), the relation (7) will in general\nbe stronger than the one in ineq. (5), if the ensemble\nconsists of n = dim{HA \u2297 HB } states that spans HA \u2297\nHB , and if we replace E by ER . We conjecture that the\nrelation (7) is in general stronger than the one in (5), at\nleast when we replace E by ER . In particular, we believe\nthat Q \u2265 ER + log2 N \u2212 log2 n.\nFor the case of the four Bell states, given with equal\nLOCC\nprior probabilities, Iacc\n= 1. This follows from ineq.\n(5) and the fact that measuring in the computational baLOCC\nsis gives Iacc\n\u2265 1. And for this case, we have proven\nthat Q = 1. Therefore we have proven inequality (7) for\nthe case of four Bell states given with equal probabilities. Ineq. (7) is true also for the more general ensemble\n\u2032\n\u2032\nB . From ineq. (5), we have that for the ensemble B ,\nLOCC\nIacc\n\u2264 2 \u2212 21 (H(|a|2 ) + H(|c|2 )). But a measurement\nin the computational basis shows that this bound can be\n\u2032\nachieved. Using the value of Q obtained for B , we have\nthe inequality (7) proven for this ensemble. One may\nsimilarly prove the inequality (7) for the canonical set of\nmaximally entangled states in d \u2297 d.\nFor the case of the ensemble of the three Bell states\n|\u03c6\u00b1 i, |\u03c8 + i, given with equal prior probabilities, a meaLOCC\nsurement in the computational basis gives Iacc\n\u2265\n2\nlog2 3 \u2212 3 . And the fact that set {|00i , |11i , |\u03c8 + i} is\nan LOCC-distinguishable ensemble in the span of |\u03c6\u00b1 i,\n|\u03c8 + i, gives Q \u2264 32 . Note here that these two inequalities\ndo not have a contradiction with the proposed ineq. (7).\nOne may consider ineq. (6) for the case of an ensemble of a single system, with all quantum mechanically\nallowed operations in \u039b. Then ineq. (6) can be seen\nas a \"Heisenberg uncertainty relation\". The accessible\ninformation is the maximal \"information gain\" that is\npossible about the system. On the other hand, Q denotes the quantumness of the ensemble, quantifying the\nresistance to such information gain. In this case of a\nsingle system, it is actually possible to prove the ineq.\n(6) in a restricted case. For an ensemble {px , \u033ax }N\nx=1 ,\ndefined on the Hilbert\naccessible informa\u0011\n\u0010 space H, the\nP\nN\nr\nH({p\n}\n)\n)\n\u2212\ntion, Iacc = maxM H({px }N\nx|y x=1 ,\nx=1\ny y\n\nwhere a measurement M = {y} has been performed, the\nmeasurement result y having occured with probability ry .\npx|y is the probability that the signal was \u033ax , given that\nthe outcome was y. The maximization is carried over all\nmeasurements. The quantity within the maximization is\nthe mutual information between the source producing the\nensemble {px , \u033ax }N\nx=1 and the maesurement outcomes.\nBut we know that H(X) \u2212 H(X|Y ) = H(Y ) \u2212 H(Y |X),\nfor random variables X and Y . Therefore H({px }N\nx=1 ) \u2212\n\nPN\n= H({py }y ) \u2212 x=1 px H({py|x}y ).\nAt this point, we restrict ourselves to only projection\nvalued measurements on H. Then we have Iacc \u2264\nmaxM H({py }y ) \u2212 Q \u2264 log2 dim H \u2212 Q \u2264 log2 N \u2212 Q,\nwhich is just the inequality in (6).\nN\ny ry H({px|y }x=1 )\n\nP\n\nIt is conceivable that the complementarity in ineq. (6)\nis true only when we consider a certain form of regularisation of the quantity Q. Given an ensemble {px , \u033ax } and a\nset of allowed operations \u039b, consider Q0 for an extension\n{px , \u033ax \u2297 |0i h0|} of the given ensemble, where |0i is any\nstate that is free under \u039b. The regularization is then the\nminimum of Q0 's for all possible such extensions. This\nbrings in the possibility of vanishing regularized Q even\nfor some ensembles that are indistinguishable under \u039b.\nThis work is supported by EU grants RESQ and\nQUPRODIS, and by the University of Gda\u0144sk, Grant\nNo. BW/5400-5-0256-3.\n\n[1] C.H.
