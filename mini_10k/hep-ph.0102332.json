Here either relaxing the principle of locality or abandoning the positivity of the representation space (or both) is required. As quantum gauge\nfield theories in covariant gauges demand indefinite metric spaces, and as locality is of fundamental importance,\nit is suggestive to relate confinement to the violation\nof positivity in Yang\u2013Mills theories: No colored states\nshould be present in the positive definite space of physical states defined by some suitable condition maintaining\nphysical S-matrix unitarity. Exploiting the BRS symmetry of the gauge fixed action a nilpotent BRS-charge QB\nin an indefinite metric space V can be constructed. The\nsubspace Vp = Ker QB is defined by those states which\nare annihilated by the BRS charge QB . Positivity is then\nproved for physical states [1] (see also refs. [2,3]) which\nare given by the cohomology H(QB , V) = Ker QB /ImQB ,\nthe covariant space of equivalence classes of BRS-closed\nmodulo BRS-exact states.\nLongitudinal and timelike gluons form BRS quartets\ntogether with ghosts and are thus unphysical. At the\na\nsame time the global symmetry J\u03bc,\u03bd\ncorresponding to\ngauge transformations generated by \u03b8a (x) = aa\u03bc x\u03bc is\nspontaneously broken quite analogous to the displacement symmetry in QED. The identification of BRSsinglet states with color singlets is non-perturbatively\npossible if this global symmetry is restored [1,2,4]. The\ncondition for a dynamical restoration of this symmetry is\nthe Kugo\u2013Ojima confinement criterion which is a requirement on the infrared behavior of a four-point Green's\nfunction. In Landau gauge, a sufficient condition for this\ncriterion is that the nonperturbative ghost propagator is\nmore singular than a massless pole in the infrared [4]:\nab\nDG\n(p) = \u03b4 ab\n\nG(p2 )\np2 \u21920\n, with G(p2 ) \u2212\u2192 \u221e .\n2\np\n\n(1)\n\nThis mechanism is correlated to the derivation [5] of\nthe Oehme\u2013Zimmermann superconvergence relations [6]\nfrom Ward\u2013Takahashi identities. These superconvergence relations formalize a long known contradiction be-\n\ntween asymptotic freedom and the positivity of the spectral density for transverse gluons in the covariant gauge.\nThe violation of positivity of transverse gluons is unambiguously established by a variety of independent nonperturbative studies of the gluon propagator [7]. Furthermore, recent lattice calculations investigate the Kugo\u2013\nOjima criterion directly [8]. As infrared singularities are\nanticipated, also non-perturbative continuum methods,\nbesides lattice calculations, are necessary to investigate\nthis and related pictures of confinement in more detail.\nThe Green's functions of a quantum field theory obey\nthe Dyson\u2013Schwinger equations. For realistic theories\nthis infinite tower of integral equations cannot be solved\ndirectly, and truncations are necessary to obtain (numerical) solutions. The ones for QCD propagators can then\nbe used to formulate a successful hadron physics phenomenology, see e.g. the recent reviews [3,9].\nThe results of two recent truncation schemes [10,11]\nsuggest that the Kugo\u2013Ojima confinement criterion for\nthe ghost propagator and the violation of positivity for\ntransverse gluon correlations are fulfilled. Obviously, the\nquestion arises whether these results are sensitive to the\nemployed truncation schemes.\nIn this letter we will exploit the general structure of the\nsimplest QCD Dyson\u2013Schwinger equation, the one for the\nghost two\u2013point function, to relate the infrared behavior of gluon and ghost propagators. Thereby the Kugo\u2013\nOjima confinement criterion will be verified by purely analytical methods. Using the rather unique properties of\nthe ghost-gluon vertex in the Landau gauge and assuming the applicability of a powerlaw ansatz in the infrared\nthe ghost Dyson\u2013Schwinger equation admits a completely\ngeneral qualitative analysis. Instead of truncating the\nsystem, the general forms for the unknown functions constrained by various consistency arguments, notably multiplicative renormalizability, are input into the equation\nunder an asymptotic expansion in the infrared momentum scale, c.f. the method described in ref. [12].\nWe start by providing some basic notations. The general form of the gluon propagator in Landau gauge is\npurely transverse and is given by [3,9]\n\n\fab\nD\u03bc\u03bd\n(p)\n\n=\u03b4\n\nab\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\np\u03bc p\u03bd Z(p2 )\ng\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 2\n,\np\np2\n\n(2)\n\nwhich defines the gluon renormalization function Z(p2 ).\nThe ghost renormalization function G(p2 ) is established\nin eq. (1). We define the ghost-gluon vertex\nabc\n\u0393abc\n\u0393\u03bc (p1 , p2 , p3 )\n\u03bc (p1 , p2 , p3 ) = \u2212igf\n\n(3)\n\nwith antighost (p1 ), ghost (p2 ) and gluon (p3 ) momentum\nincoming, i.e. p1 + p2 + p3 = 0. At tree-level the dressing\nfunctions reduce to\nZ(p2 ) = G(p2 ) = 1,\n\n\u0393\u03bc (p1 , p2 , p3 ) = p1\u03bc .\n\n(4)\n\nThese renormalized dressing functions are related to the\nbare ones by the usual renormalization constants Z3\n(gluon wave function), Ze3 (ghost wave function) and Ze1\ne1 = 1\n(ghost-gluon vertex). In Landau gauge one has Z\n[13,14], i.e., the ghost-gluon vertex has not to be renormalized .\nThe renormalized ghost dressing function G(p2 ) is a dimensionless function of a single variable. In pure Yang\u2013\nMills theory there are only two scales present: the external scale p2 and the renormalization scale \u03bc2 . Therefore\nG is a function of the ratio p2 /\u03bc2 only. As the external\nscale vanishes this function can be written as an asymptotic expansion. Renormalizability implies that it must\nalso depend on the renormalized coupling g. This motivates the power series ansatz\n2\n\n2\n\nG(p ; \u03bc ) =\n\nX\nn\n\ndn\n\n\u0012\n\np2\n\u03bc2\n\n\u0013\u03b4n\n\n,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere the coefficients dn and the exponents \u03b4n are, at\nleast in principle, functions of g. We will see below that\nthe exponents \u03b4n will be independent of g. Furthermore,\nas will be shown later on, the series (5) has a lowest\npower \u03b40 such that as the external scale p2 vanishes the\nghost dressing function G(p2 ) is well approximated by\na powerlaw. Multiplicative renormalizability allows to\nderive the renormalization group (RG) equation\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2202\n\u2202\n(6)\n+ \u03b2(g)\n\u2212 2\u03b3G G(p2 ; \u03bc2 ) = 0\n\u03bc\n\u2202\u03bc\n\u2202g\nwith \u03b2(g) being the beta function, and\n\u2212 12\n\ne\n\u2202 log Z\n3\n\u03b3G = \u03bc\n\u2202\u03bc\n\nSince the logarithm has no matching factor the exponents \u03b4n must be independent of the renormalized coupling (\u2202\u03b4n /\u2202g = 0). Using \u03b2(g) = \u2212g(2\u03b3G + \u03b3A ) with\n\u22121\n\n\u03b3A = \u03bc\u2202 log Z3 2 /\u2202\u03bc the resulting differential equation\nfor the coefficients dn has the general solution\ndn = const. g\n\n\u2212\n\n2(\u03b4n +\u03b3G )\n2\u03b3G +\u03b3A\n\n.\n\n(9)\n\nExpanding the renormalized gluon dressing function\nX \u0012 p2 \u0013\u01ebn\nZ(p2 ; \u03bc2 ) =\nen\n(10)\n\u03bc2\nn\none arrives in a completely analogous way at\nen = const. g\n\n\u2212\n\n2(\u01ebn +\u03b3G )\n2\u03b3G +\u03b3A\n\n.\n\n(11)\n\nIn the renormalization process we have to specify the\ncorresponding normalization conditions. We require that\nthe unrenormalized functions reduce to a constant at\nasymptotically large momenta. Exploiting additionally\nmultiplicative renormalizability and using eq. (5) one obtains the formal relation\n!\u22121\nX \u0012 \u039b2 \u0013\u03b4n\ne3 (\u03bc2 , \u039b2 ) \u221d\n.\n(12)\nZ\ndn\n\u03bc2\nn\nThis equation is only well-defined if the corresponding series makes sense, e.g. if it is resumable by some method.\nThis is the main assumption throughout the presented\nderivation. One consistency check is provided by inserting the general solution for the coefficients dn (9) and\nrewriting the renormalized coupling g in terms of the\nscale \u03bc. This yields\n\u0012 2 \u0013\u03b3G\ne3 (\u03bc2 , \u039b2 ) \u221d \u039b\n(13)\nZ\n\u03bc2\n\nwhich is precisely the correct dependence to agree with\nthe definition of \u03b3G . A completely analogous argument\napplies to the gluon renormalization constant Z3 .\nThe tensor structure of the ghost-gluon vertex reads\n\u0393\u03bc (p1 , p2 , p3 ) = p1\u03bc A(p2i ) + p3\u03bc B(p2i ) .\n\nIn Landau gauge the ghost-gluon vertex becomes bare\nwhen the ghost momentum p2 vanishes [13,14]:\np2 \u21920\n\n(7)\n\nis related to the ghost anomalous dimension. Inserting\nthe series (5) into eq. (6), and exploiting that p2 is a free\n(though small) parameter one obtains\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202dn\np2 \u2202\u03b4n\n\u2212 dn \u03b4n + \u03b2(g)\n+ dn \u03b3G = 0.

This is in accordance with the fact that the renore1 = 1.\nmalization constant Z\nThe RG equation for the vertex function can be split\ninto two parts, one for each of the tensor components.\nIt is only necessary to consider the equation for A, and\ne1 = 1, it is identical to the RG equation for the\nsince Z\n\n\fcoupling. Writing the vertex function as a series has the\ncomplication of several momentum scales. For our considerations it is sufficient to simply extract the scale and\ncoupling dependence\n\u0012 2 \u0013\u03bak\nX\np3\n,\n(16)\nA(p2i ; \u03bc2 ) =\nak (p21 , p22 )\u03bbk\n\u03bc2\nk\n\nwith\n\u03bbk = g 2\n\n\u0001\u2212 \u03b3\n\n\u03bak\nA +2\u03b3G\n\n.\n\n(17)\n\nWe must renormalize the ghost-gluon vertex at the point\np2 = 0 since this corresponds to a zero finite renormale1 = 1. Knowing the p2 \u2192 0 limit of the\nization from Z\nfull vertex does not constrain A. (When p2 = 0 one only\nhas A \u2212 B = 1.) With this given limit and the additional\nrequirement that the ghost equation should provide a\nconsistent solution one infers that\n\u0012 2 \u0013\u03bak\nX\n\u039b\n2\n2\n2\n2 2\nA(p1 = p3 = \u039b , p2 = 0; \u03bc ) =\nak \u03bbk\n(18)\n\u03bc2\nk\n\nis a finite positive constant. Asymptotic freedom requires\nthat \u03b3A + 2\u03b3G > 0. In the unrenormalized theory the\nvertex should be bare when the unrenormalized coupling\ne1 = 1. Therefore \u03bak \u2264 0 with the\nvanishes because Z\nhighest value \u03ba0 = 0.\nThe ultraviolet region of the ghost Dyson\u2013Schwinger\nequation corresponds to a small (albeit non-vanishing)\nghost momentum p2 and all other momenta large. For\nthe following discussions it is helpful to write\n\u0012 2 \u0013\u03bak \u0012 2 \u0013\u03c1m\nX\np2\np3\n(19)\nA(p2i ; \u03bc2 )p2 \u21920 =\nbk (p21 )\u03bbk\n\u03bc2\np23\nk,m\n\nwhere the \u03c1m \u2265 0 and \u03c10 = 0.\nThe full Euclidean ghost Dyson\u2013Schwinger equation\ncan be written after having performed the two trivial\nangular integrals as\ne3\nG\u22121 (x) = Z\n(20)\n2\nZ \u03c0\n2 Z \u039b\nCA g\nG(z)\n2\n\u2212\nA(z, x, y) ,\nd\u03b8 sin4 \u03b8\ndyZ(y)\n2\n16\u03c0 0\n\u03c0 0\nz\nwhere \u03b8 is the angle between the two internal loop momenta corresponding to y = q 2 and z = (p \u2212 q)2 with\nx = p2 . CA = Nc is the resulting color factor. When\nusing the expansions (5) and (10) the angular integration splits the radial integral into two parts, the lower\npart Igh (0 \u2192 x) and the upper part Jgh (x \u2192 \u039b2 ). The\nexpression derived from the upper limit will be some combination of factors with the ratio x/\u039b2 to some power.\nThe effect of an exact angular integration is to generate\na hypergeometric function whose argument is x/y and\nwhich can be expanded in a convergent series with positive integer powers of x/y starting with unity. Thus, the\nz-dependence of the vertex function is unimportant.\n\nThe most important aspect is that the ghost-gluon vertex reduces to its tree-level form as the in-ghost momentum vanishes. In the ultraviolet part of the integral this\nis precisely the case: the in-ghost momentum is the infrared external scale x. Therefore the vertex function can\nbe written in the form of eq. (19).\nUsing the series for G and Z, it is possible to write the\nghost equation with the most general vertex function as\n!\u22121\nX \u0012 x \u0013\u03b4n\ne3\n=Z\n(21)\ndn\n\u03bc2\nn\n\u0012 \u0013\u01ebj +\u03b4k \u0010\n\u0011\nCA g 2 X\nx\n\u2212\nIgh (\u01ebj , \u03b4k ) + Jgh (\u01ebj , \u03b4k ) .\nej dk\n2\n2\n16\u03c0\n\u03bc\nj,k\n\nwhere Igh and Jgh represent the lower and upper regions\nof the integral, respectively. The integrals Igh must contain factors characterized by the \u03bak but there are no restrictions on its form except that the vertex must have\npositive powers of the coupling. As the integral Igh is\nvery difficult to compute we will not be able to proceed\nby studying its general properties.\nIt is frequently asserted that only the infrared integrals of Dyson\u2013Schwinger equations can contribute to the\nrenormalized propagator functions on the left hand side\nbecause this is the only fully renormalizable possibility.\nIndeed, one can show that upper integral Jgh will not\ncontribute directly to the propagator functions [15]. It is\ne3 that provides the key to\nthe renormalization constant Z\nthe infrared behavior of the propagators, and only the ultraviolet integral can yield the ultraviolet divergent part\nof the ghost equation. First we note that Jgh (\u01ebj , \u03b4k ) can\nbe expanded as\n\u0012 2 \u0013\u01ebj +\u03b4k \u2212\u03c1m \u2212q \u0012 2 \u0013\u03bal\nX\n\u039b\n\u039b\nJgh =\nJj,k,l,m,q\n\u03bbl\n, (22)\nx\n\u03bc2\nl,m,q\n\nwhere \u03c1m \u2265 0 represents the kinematical content of the\nvertex function, and q = 0, 1, . . . denotes the order of the\ne3 has to be independent\nangular integration series. As Z\nof x one deduces from eqs. (21,22) that only \u03c10 = q = 0\nwill contribute. All other terms involve x/\u039b2 to a positive\npower and subsequently vanish:\ne3 (\u03bc2 , \u039b2 ) =\nZ\nCA g 2\n16\u03c0 2\n\nX\n\nj,k,l\n\nej dk Jj,k,l,0,0 \u03bbl\n\n\u0012\n\n\u039b2\n\u03bc2\n\n\u0013\u01ebj +\u03b4k +\u03bal\n\n.\n\n(23)\n\nUsing that expression (18) is a constant, employing the\nexpansion (12) and multiplying through with the left\nhand side yields\n\u0012 2 \u0013\u01ebj +\u03b4i +\u03b4k\n\u039b\nCA g 2 X\n= const.\nej di dk J0,0,0 (\u01ebj , \u03b4k )\n2\n16\u03c0\n\u03bc2\ni,j,k\n\n(24)\n\n\fSince \u01eb0 and \u03b40 are the unique lowest powers, and the\nterm with i = j = k = 0 has nothing to compete with\nit must be responsible for the non-vanishing part of the\nleft hand side of this equation. Therefore it must be\nindependent of \u039b2 /\u03bc2 , and we obtain\n\u01eb0 = \u22122\u03b40 ,\n\n(25)\n\ni.e. we have shown that the leading infrared powers of\nthe gluon and the ghost propagator are uniquely related.\nNote that this result is valid even if corresponding series\nare not convergent. We have simply matched the coefficients of an asymptotic series. Therefore, our underlying\nassumption is that the employed series have to exist in\nthe sense of being, at least, asymptotic ones.\nEq. (24) constrains the values of the related leading\npowers. To do this, one needs to explicitly evaluate the\nintegrals Jj,k,0,0,0 which are readily calculated from the\nfull ghost equation with a bare vertex stripping off the\nterms that depend on the external scale x. Concentrating\non the leading powers we obtain:\n\u2212\n\n1\n3 CA g 2\ne0 d20 > 0.\n4 16\u03c0 2\n\u03b40\n\n(26)\n\nTo yield a positive ghost renormalization function (i.e. to\nkeep the negative-norm property of the ghost states) the\ncorresponding leading order coefficients e0 and d0 must\nbe positive. As the coupling is positive this yields:\n\u03b40 < 0 .\n\n(27)\n\nThis relation implies that the Kugo\u2013Ojima confinement\ncriterion, see eq. (1), is fulfilled.\nA lower bound on \u03b40 can be derived from the lower\nbound of the integral in the ghost equation. As this\nbound is considerably weaker as the one following from\na generalized masslessness condition (see eq. (192) in ref.\n[3]) \u03b40 > \u22121, we will not present its derivation here. This\nimplies 2 > \u01eb0 > 0: The gluon propagator is suppressed\nin the infrared as compared to its tree-level form.\nIn summary, we have investigated the general structure\nof the ghost Dyson\u2013Schwinger equation in Landau gauge.\nA general series form for the propagator and vertex functions has been employed. No specialized ansatz for the\nghost-gluon vertex has been used. Care has been taken\nnot to use approximations that destroy the generality of\nthe results. Multiplicative renormalizability, and especially the non-renormalization of the ghost-gluon vertex,\nhave placed the constraints to relate uniquely the leading\ninfrared behavior of the gluon and the ghost propagator.\nWe have found an infrared enhanced ghost propagator\nthereby verifying the Kugo\u2013Ojima confinement criterion\n[1,4] directly. Due to the relation (25) this corresponds\nto an infrared suppressed gluon propagator. For a noninteger leading infrared power this implies that positivity is violated and the Oehme\u2013Zimmermann superconvergence relation [6] is fulfilled non-perturbatively. Considering only the ghost equation as in this letter an infrared\n\nconstant gluon propagator cannot be excluded. To investigate this question one has to consider additionally the\ngluon Dyson\u2013Schwinger equation [15].\nAcknowledgements\nWe want to express our gratitude to M.R.
