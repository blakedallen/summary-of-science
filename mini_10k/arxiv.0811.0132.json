Introduction\nTime reversal (TR) is the process of recording the signal, time-reversing and re-propagating\nthe signal. When the signal is from a localized source the time reversed field is expected to\nfocus on the source. Time reversal of acoustic waves has led to applications in ultrasound\nand underwater acoustics including brain therapy, lithotripsy, nondestructive testing and\ntelecommunications [17]. An even greater potential holds for the time reversal of electromagnetic waves which is closely related to optical phase conjugation [28].\nRecently, time reversal experiments with optical and micro waves demonstrate phase conjugation of optical near field and the robustness of turbidity suppression by optical phase\nconjugation [5, 6, 11, 21, 27].\nMotivated by these exciting experiments, we reconsider time reversal from basic principle,\ndiscuss various TR schemes and their mutual relations, and make general observations about\nthe focusing properties of near-field and far-field time reversal.\nFirst, we review the principle of perfect time reversal in a closed cavity based on the Green\nsecond identity and discuss the focusing properties of the perfect TR kernel (the PorterBojarski kernel). We review the well known fact that in the free space the TR focal spot of\na field with source is always diffraction-limited even when all the evanescent components are\nThe research is supported in part by Darpa Grant N00014-02-1-0603 .\n1\n\n\frecorded by time reversal mirror (Section 2 and 4). The perfect time reversal is \"perfect\"\nonly for the source-free fields. On the contrary, any medium inhomogeneities, no matter how\nweak, always give rise to a nonvanishing evanescent component in the time reversed field.\nNext we derive four other time reversal schemes (monopole, dipole and two mixed modes)\nfrom the Porter-Bojarski kernel and analyze their behaviors with one planar TRM. We derive\ntheir mutual relationships for the paraxial wave. For the boundary behavior, we show that\nfor paraxial wave only the monopole TR scheme satisfies the exact boundary condition while\nfor the spherical wave only the MD-mode TR scheme satisfies the exact boundary condition.\nA main interest here is the near-field focusing property of various TRMs. We show that\nto achieve a subwavelength focusing the near-field time reversal mirror should involve dipole\nfields in the sense that the TRM records not just the field but the normal gradient of the\nfield and/or back-propagate the dipole field in proportion to the phase-conjugate recorded\ndata. The dipole TRM records and re-transmits the dipole field while the mixed mode TRM\ninvolves only one of the processes. The monopole TRM records and transmits only the\nmonopole field. The transverse resolution of the dipole TRM is linearly proportional to the\ndistance between the point source and TRM. The mixed mode TRM has the similar (linear)\nbehavior in three dimensions but in two dimensions the transverse resolution behaves as\nthe square-root of the distance between the point source and TRM. The monopole TRM is\nineffective to focus below wavelength (Section 3).\nWe also point out that TR focal spot with a finite aperture is generally closer to the TRM\nthan the source point in the free space or a weakly scattering medium such as consisting\nof phase scatterers (Section 5). In other words, in the absence of multiple scattering in\nthe medium, TR as focusing or imaging method is biased. In comparison, the conventional\nmatched field processor and the phase processor always produce a centered focal spot (Section\n5). Lastly in Section 6, we explain how the random effect in multiple scattering can restore\nthe centeredness of TR focal spot on the source point as well as the stability condition for\nthe robustness of turbidity suppression by phase conjugation [27].\n2. Perfect time reversal\nConsider a real-valed signal in the temporal Fourier representation\nZ\nU (r, t) = u(r, \u03c9)e\u2212i\u03c9t d\u03c9.\nThe real-valuedness of U implies that u(r, \u2212\u03c9) = u\u2217 (r, \u03c9).\nTherefore, time reversal is\nequivalent to phase conjugation of every frequency component u(r, \u03c9) \u2192 u\u2217 (r, \u03c9), \u2200\u03c9, r.\nIdeally, TR turns a divergent wave into a convergent wave, thus focusing wave energy.\nA practical way of phase conjugation within some control domain is to operate TR from\nthe boundary of the control domain as we consider next.\nConsider a monochromatic scalar wave u propagating in a medium characterized by the\nrefractive index n which in general varies in space. Such a u satisfies the Helmholtz equation\n(1)\n\n\u2206u + k 2 n2 u = f\n\nsubject to suitable boundary conditions where f is the source of compact, localized support.\nWe assume that the medium is dissipationless, i.e. n2 is real-valued.\nIn time reversal, the source f emits a wave field u which is then recorded at the boundary\n\u2202D of the (topologically open) domain D. The typical domain can be one of the following\n2\n\n\fD\n\nD\n\nD\n\nFigure 1. Three representative domains: (i) a bounded domain (left), (ii) an\ninfinite slab (middle) and (iii) a half space. The dark areas represent medium\ninhomogeneities (scatterers).\nthree kinds: bounded with a closed boundary, infinite slab with two planar boundaries, or\nhalf space with one planar boundary (Figure 1).\nConsider a bounded domain D first. Let both u and \u2202u/\u2202n be recorded at \u2202D, phaseconjugated and back-propagated into the domain D and let v(r) be the resulting wave field.\nLet G(x, y) be the Green function of (1). The time reversal principle originally proposed in\n[8] is described by\nZ\nZ\n0\n\u2202u\u2217 (r0 )\n0\n\u2217 0 \u2202G(r, r )\nu (r )\nv(r) \u2261\n(2)\nd\u03c3(r ) \u2212\nG(r, r0 )d\u03c3(r0 ).\n\u2202n\n\u2202n\n\u2202D\n\u2202D\nClearly, v(r) is a source-free solution of the Helmholtz equation in D.\nWhenever Sommerfeld's radiation condition\n\u2202\nG(r, r0 ) \u2248 ikG(r, r0 ),\n\u2202r\n\n(3)\n\nfor all r0 sufficiently far away from r, (2) can be easily extended to the second type of\ndomains (infinite slabs) through a limiting procedure. Under this condition there is no\ndifference between type (i) (bounded) and type (ii) (infinite slab) domains.\nLet A be the time reversal mirror (TRM) considered as a part of \u2202D. At each point\non the boundary \u2202D\\A we impose either the sound soft boundary condition (G = 0) or\nthe sound hard boundary condition (\u2202G/\u2202n = 0). The boundary condition on TRM A is\nflexible except that the presence of TRM does not affect the near-field behavior of the Green\nfunction, see (26)-(27). We call either type (i) or (ii) domain of Figure 1 closed cavity.\nBy the second Green's identity we have\nZ\nZ\n0\n\u2202u\u2217 (r0 )\n\u2217 0 \u2202G(r, r )\n0\nu (r )\nd\u03c3(r ) \u2212\nG(r, r0 )d\u03c3(r0 )\n\u2202n\n\u2202n\n\u2202D\nZ\u2202D\nZ\n\u2217 0\n2 2 0\n0\n0\n(4)\n=\nu (r )(\u2206 + k n (r ))G(r, r )dr \u2212 (\u2206 + k 2 n2 (r0 ))u\u2217 (r0 )G(r, r0 )dr0 .\nD\n\nD\n\n3\n\n\fThe time reversal operation described by (2) is perfect for the field inside D when the field\nis source-free inside D (i.e. u satisfies (1) with f |D = 0 and the second integral on the right\nhand side of (4) drops out)\nv(r) = u\u2217 (r),\n\n(5)\n\nr\u2208D\n\nwhile v(r) = 0, \u2200r \u2208\n/ D\u0304 by (4). Hence (2) has been proposed as the basis for time reversal in\na closed cavity [8, 11].\nOn the other hand, if D contains sources as in typical applications, then the time reversal\ndescribed by (2) is diffraction-limited. Indeed,\nZ\n\u2217\n(6)\nf \u2217 (r0 )G(r, r0 )dr0\nv(r) = u (r) \u2212\nD\nZ\n=\n[G\u2217 (r, r0 ) \u2212 G(r, r0 )] f \u2217 (r0 )dr0\nZD\nKPB (r, r0 )f \u2217 (r0 )dr0 , r \u2208 D\n=\nD\n\nwith the Porter-Bojarski kernel\n(7)\n\nKPB (r, r0 ) = \u22122=[G(r, r0 )]\n\nwhere = denotes the imaginary part, c.f. [8]. With a real-valued n2 , KPB (r, r0 ) is an example\nof a source-free radiation field in r for each r0 . In the free space, (7) is always diffractionlimited (see Section 4).\nThe reason that KPB 6= G\u2217 is because the time symmetry is broken when the field is phase\nconjugated but not the source. A time-reversed source is a sink. Suppose now the point\nsource becomes a point sink after emitting the initial wave and suppose the sink can absorb\nthe time-reversed, incoming wave and prevent the re-emission of the outgoing wave with\nefficiency \u03c1 > 0, [10]. Then (6) becomes\n(8)\n\nv(r) = G\u2217 (r, r0 ) \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03c1)G(r, r0 ),\n\nr \u2208 D,\n\nwhich, denoted by KS , is the TR kernel with a point sink of efficiency \u03c1. When \u03c1 = 1\nthen KS = G\u2217 . As we shall see in Section 4, the TR focusing property for KS is infinitely\nenhanced over that for (7).\n3. Monopole and dipole TRMs\nIn this section we derive approximate TR schemes from (2) using Sommerfeld's radiation\ncondition (3).\nFor a closed cavity, using the sound soft/hard condition on \u2202D\\A, we write\nZ\nZ\n0\n\u2202u\u2217 (r0 )\n\u2217 0 \u2202G(r, r )\n0\nu (r )\nd\u03c3(r ) \u2212\nG(r, r0 )d\u03c3(r0 )\n\u2202n\n\u2202n\n\u2202D\n\u2202D\n\u0015\nZ \u0014Z\nZ\n0\n\u2202G\u2217 (r0 , r00 )\n\u2217 0 00 \u2202G(r, r )\n0\n0\n0\n=\nG (r , r )\nd\u03c3(r ) \u2212\nG(r, r )d\u03c3(r ) f \u2217 (r00 )dr00\n\u2202n\n\u2202n\nD\nA\nA\nwhich yields the alternative expression for the Porter-Bojarski kernel for a closed cavity\nZ\nZ\n0\n\u2202G\u2217 (r0 , r00 )\n00\n\u2217 0 00 \u2202G(r, r )\n0\n(9)\nKPB (r, r ) =\nG (r , r )\nd\u03c3(r ) \u2212\nG(r, r0 )d\u03c3(r0 )\n\u2202n\n\u2202n\nA\nA\n4\n\n\fNow we pretend |r0 \u2212 r00 |, |r \u2212 r0 | \u001d 1 and use condition (3) to motivate two other TR\nschemes. We consider all three types of domains depicted in Figure 1.\nReplacing \u2202G/\u2202r with ikG or ikG with \u2202G/\u2202r in (9) leads to, respectively, the monopole\nTR kernel\nZ\n00\n(10)\nKM (r, r ) = \u22122ik G\u2217 (r0 , r00 )G(r, r0 )d\u03c3(r0 )\nA\n\nand the dipole TR kernel\n(11)\n\n2i\nKD (r, r ) = \u2212\nk\n00\n\nZ\nA\n\n\u2202 \u2217 0 00 \u2202\nG (r , r ) G(r, r0 )d\u03c3(r0 ).\n\u2202n\n\u2202n\n\nIn addition, we introduce mixed mode TR kernels\nZ\n\u2202G(r, r0 )\n00\n(12)\nd\u03c3(r0 )\nKMD (r, r ) =\nG\u2217 (r0 , r00 )\n\u2202n\nA\nZ\n\u2202G\u2217 (r0 , r00 )\n00\nKDM (r, r ) = \u2212\n(13)\nG(r, r0 )d\u03c3(r0 )\n\u2202n\nA\nwhich are parts of (9).\nAnalogously we define the various TR schemes for a source-free field u:\nZ\n(14)\nvM (r) = \u22122ik u\u2217 (r0 )G(r, r0 )d\u03c3(r0 )\nZA\n2i\n\u2202 \u2217 0 \u2202\n(15)\nvD (r) = \u2212\nu (r ) G(r, r0 )d\u03c3(r0 )\nk A \u2202n\n\u2202n\nZ\n0\n\u2202G(r, r )\n(16)\nvMD (r) =\nu\u2217 (r0 )\nd\u03c3(r0 )\n\u2202n\nA\nZ\n\u2202u\u2217 (r0 )\n(17)\nvDM (r) = \u2212\nG(r, r0 )d\u03c3(r0 )\n\u2202n\nA\n(18)\nvPB (r) = vMD (r) + vDM (r)\nThe various TR schemes can be readily implemented for the acoustic wave. For the dipole\nTRM, the transducers record the normal pressure gradient and emit the normal dipole field in\nproportion to the phase-conjugate recorded data. For the mixed mode TRM, the transducers\nrecord the pressure (resp. pressure gradient) and emit the normal dipole (resp. monopole)\nfield in proportion to the phase-conjugate recorded data (see, for example, [12] for a similar\nproposal).\nThe time reversal schemes described by (9)-(13) and (14)-(18) are main objects of subsequent analysis. Note that the expressions (9)-(13), (14)-(18) are source-free fields in the\ndomain D regardless whether the initial wave is source-free or not.\n3.1. Paraxial wave. In the case of paraxial wave, (9), (10), (12) and (13) are explicitly\nconnected with one another as follows.\nConsider the half space D = {z > 0} with a planar TRM on the transverse plane z = 0.\nLet G(z, x, z 0 , x0 ) be the paraxial Green function where z, z 0 are the longitudinal coordinate\nand x, x0 are the transverse coordinates (see Appendix A). Let r0 = (z0 , x0 ) be the location of\n5\n\n\fthe source. Assume that the TRM is away from the medium inhomogeneities i.e. n(0, x) = 1.\nThen it can be shown that\nZ\n1\ni\nKMD (z, x, z0 , x0 ) =\nKM (z, x, z0 , x0 ) +\n(19)\n\u22070T G\u2217 (z0 , x0 , 0, x0 ) * \u22070T G(z, x, 0, x0 )dx0\n2\n2k\n= KDM (z, x, z0 , x0 )\nwhere \u22070T denotes the transverse gradient w.r.t. x0 (Appendix A). Therefore,\n1\n(20)\nKMD (r, r0 ) = KDM (r, r0 ) = KPB (r, r0 ).\n2\nLikewise, we have\nZ\n1\ni\nvMD (z, x) =\nvM (z, x) +\n\u2207T u\u2217 (0, x0 ) * \u2207T G(z, x, 0, x0 )dx0\n2\n2k\n1\n= vDM (z, x) = vPB (z, x).\n2\n3.2. Boundary value. Though not fundamental to many time reversal applications, it is\nsometimes desirable for the TR schemes to satisfy the boundary condition\n(21)\n\nKX (r, r0 ) = G\u2217 (r, r0 ),\n\nvX (r) = u\u2217 (r),\n\nr\u2208A\n\nwhere X = M, D, MD, DM, PB. We have already seen that in a closed cavity vPB satisfies\nthe boundary condition but KPB does not.\nIn Appendix B we show that, surprisingly, for the paraxial wave, only the monopole TR\nscheme satisfies the boundary condition (21) and for the spherical wave in the free space,\nonly the mixed mode TR scheme vMD , KMD , multiplied by 2, satisfy (21).\n4. Near-Field focusing\nIn this section, we analyze the near-field focusing property of various TR schemes. We\nshow that KD , KMD , KDM give rise to a subwavelength focal spot of size proportional to\nthe distance from the source to TRM while KM and KPB can hardly achieve subwavelength\nfocusing. In the free\n\u221a space, the focal spot size for the paraxial wave is always comparable to\nthe Fresnel length \u03bbz0 which is not applicable for z0 \u001c \u03bb.\nConsider the Porter-Bojarski kernel for the free space Green function in three dimensions,\n(22)\n\nKPB =\n\nsin (k|r \u2212 r0 |)\n2\u03c0|r \u2212 r0 |\n\nand compare it with the real part of KS defined by (8)\n(23)\n\n<[KS ] = \u03c1\n\ncos (k|r \u2212 r0 |)\n,\n4\u03c0|r \u2212 r0 |\n\n\u03c1>0\n\nwhich dominates over the imaginary part for \u03c1 \u2248 1 and |r \u2212 r0 | \u2264 \u03bb/4.\nResolution of an imaging system generally refers to either the focal spot size or the minimum resolvable distance between two points or lines (two-point or -line resolution). And\nthese two ideas are related: the focal spot size is a crude estimate of the minimum resolvable\ndistance.\nWith all the insights into superresolution techniques, it is now well accepted that in the\nabsence of noise and with perfect knowledge of the imaging system there is no limitation\n6\n\n\fto the two-point resolution. Fundamentally, this is because an image with infinite signal-tonoise ratio can convey an arbitrary amount of information [3].\nSince we do not account for the noise explicitly we will focus on the idea of focal spot\nsize as a measure of focusing and image sharpness. According to Rayleigh's criterion which\nessentially defines the spot size as the distance of the first zeros to the maximum point, (22)\nhas a spot size of \u03bb/2 and (23) has a spot size of \u03bb/4. But in reality the focal spot is in some\nsense \"in the eye of the viewer\" and one readily recognizes the vastly sharper graph of (23)\nthan that of (22).\nThis contrast is better described by the standard (Houston) criterion used in astronomy\nwhich is to adopt the \"full width at half maximum\" (FWHM) [18]. The FWHM of (22) is\nabout \u03bb/2 while the FWHM of (23) is zero since the maximum of (23) is infinity (therefore\ninfinitely sharp). Indeed, the singularity is the signature of a point source.\nThe subwavelength, superresolution of (23) can be understood from Weyl's angular spectrum of plane waves. For the imaging direction z, the free space Green function in three\ndimensions has the angular spectrum representation\nZ\neikr\nik\nds1 ds2\n=\n(24)\nexp [ik(s1 (x \u2212 x0 ) + s2 (y \u2212 y0 ) + s3 |z \u2212 z0 |)]\nr\n2\u03c0\ns3\nwhere\np\n(x \u2212 x0 )2 + (y \u2212 y0 )2 + (z \u2212 z0 )2\nq\n=\n1 \u2212 s21 \u2212 s22 , s21 + s22 \u2264 1\nq\n= i s21 + s22 \u2212 1, s21 + s22 > 1\n\nr =\ns3\ns3\n\n[9].\nThe integrand in (24) with s21 + s22 \u2264 1 corresponds to the propagating (homogeneous)\nwave and that with s21 +s22 > 1 corresponds to the evanescent (inhomogeneous) wave.\np Let WH\nand WE denote the homogeneous and the evanescent fields, respectively. Since k s21 + s22 is\nthe transverse wavenumber, WH contains the diffraction-limited information about the point\nsource while WE contains the sub-wavelength information about the point source.\nThe first important observation is that WE is always real-valued. Consequently, the TR\nkernel KPB in the case of G = G0 contains no evanescent component. Secondly, WH is\nbounded and in the \u03b4-neighborhood of the source point the estimate holds: |<[WH ]| = O(\u03b4).\nIn other words, in the immediate vicinity of the source point <[G0 ] essentially coincides with\nWE . This means that <[G0 ] contains all the subwavelength information about the point\nsource.\nTherefore, (6) is always diffraction-limited no matter how narrow the support of f is and\nhow close the source is to the TRM. This means that in the absence of scattering even when\nthe evanescent waves are recorded, phase-conjugated and back-propagated, the resulting field\nis still smeared below the scale of wavelength. In general, if |<[G]| \u001d |=[G]| in the near field\nas is the case for the free space, the latter does not contribute to the leading order effect of\nthe near field TR and hence that TR, which affects only the phase, has a secondary effect\non the subwavelength resolution of the near field TR.\nSince we are concerned here with the asymptotic behavior of near field TR as the point\nsource approaches the TRM, we relax the definition of FWHM. Instead of \"full width at half\n7\n\n\fmaximum\" in the literal sense we also refer to the (asymptotic) resolution as the asymptotic\nsize of a focal spot as the maximum width at the same (or the minimum width at a slower)\nasymptotic behavior of the point-spread function. For example, in this metric, the focal spot\nsize for (22) is \u03bb/2 while the truncated version of (23):\n\u001a\n\u001b\n1 cos (k|r \u2212 r0 |)\nmin\n(25)\n,\u03c1\n, \u03b4\u001c1\n\u03b4\n4\u03c0|r \u2212 r0 |\nhas an asymptotic spot size O(\u03b4).\nNext we shall analyze the near-field focusing property of the various TR schemes. We\nassume the near field asymptotic\n|G(r, r0 )| \u223c\n\n(26)\n\n1\n,\n|r \u2212 r0 |\n\n|r \u2212 r0 | \u2264 \u03bb.\n\nFor |r \u2212 r0 | \u001c \u03bb (26) is the generally correct asymptotic as the near field singularity is\ndetermined solely by the Laplacian in the Helmholtz equation [19]. In addition to (26) we\nfurther assume\nr \u2212 r0\n\u2207G(r, r0 ) \u223c\n(27)\n, |r \u2212 r0 | \u2264 \u03bb.\n|r \u2212 r0 |3\n4.1. Transverse resolution of monopole TR. Consider the case of a point monopole\nsource located at r0 in close proximity of A. Let r00 be the closest point on A to r0 and\n|r0 \u2212 r00 | = \u03b4 \u001c 1. Using (26) we have the estimate\nKM (r0 , r0 ) = O(\u2212k log \u03b4)\nsince the singularity in the integrand of (10) is\n(28)\n\n|r0\n\nk\n,\n\u2212 r0 ||r \u2212 r0 |\n\n|r \u2212 r0 | \u001c \u03bb,\n\n|r0 \u2212 r00 | \u001c \u03bb.\n\nMore explicitly, the integral (10) can be simplified by replacing the surface integral over A\nby the tangent plane at r00 . Without loss of generality, we may assume the tangent plane to\nbe the x \u2212 y plane and r0 = (0, 0, \u03b4). The leading order transverse profile of KM around r0\nin x is given by\nZ\n(29)\nk (x02 + y 02 + \u03b4 2 )\u22121/2 ((x \u2212 x0 )2 + y 02 + \u03b4 2 )\u22121/2 dx0 dy 0 , \u03b4 \u001c 1\nwhere the integration is restricted to a bounded area, say the circular disk of radius \u03bb, around\nthe origin to avoid logarithmic divergence at large x0 , y 0 .\nLet x = \u03b4 \u03b1 , 0 \u2264 \u03b1 < 1. Then (29) has the same asymptotic as\nZ\n(30)\nk (x02 + y 02 )\u22121/2 ((\u03b4 \u03b1 \u2212 x0 )2 + y 02 )\u22121/2 dx0 dy 0 , \u03b4 \u001c 1\nwhere the integration is over the punctured disk with holes of radius \u03b4 centered at (0, 0) and\n(\u03b4 \u03b1 , 0) since the two holes have a vanishing contribution to (29). The change of variables\nfrom x0 , y 0 to x00 = x0 /\u03b4 \u03b1 , y 00 = y 0 /\u03b4 \u03b1 renders (30) into\nZ\n(31)\nk (x002 + y 002 )\u22121/2 ((1 \u2212 x00 )2 + y 002 )\u22121/2 dx00 dy 00\n8\n\n\fmax half diameter: K :1.370 , K :0.030 , K\nM\n\nD\n\n:0.070 , K\n\nMD\n\n:0.070\n\nmax half width: K :0.35650 , K :0.00421 , K\n\nDM\n\nM\n\n1\n\nD\n\n:0.00947 , K\n\nMD\n\n:0.00947\n\nDM\n\n1\n\nKM\n\nM\nD\n\nKMD\n\nKMD\n\nK\n\nK\n\nDM\n\n0.8\n\n0.7\n\n0.7\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0\n\n0\n!1\n\nK\n\n0.9\n\nDM\n\n0.8\n\n|K|\n\nK\n\nKD\n\n0.9\n\n!0.8\n\n!0.6\n\n!0.4\n\n!0.2\n\n0\nx\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n1\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\nz\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\nFigure\n2.

However, this scaling behavior requires extremely small\n\u03b4 to manifest itself. Outside this regime, the focal spot size would decrease slowly as \u03b4\ndecreases (see the comments on Figure 2).\n4.2. Transverse resolution of dipole TR. For r0 = r00 and r = r0 , r \u2212 r0 is orthogonal to\nA and thus |\u2207G| \u223c |\u2202G/\u2202n|. Therefore the leading order transverse profile for KD (r, r0 ) is\ngiven approximately by\nZ\n1\n\u03b4\n\u03b4\n(33)\n\u00d7\ndx0 dy 0 .\nk\n(x02 + y 02 + \u03b4 2 )3/2 ((x \u2212 x0 )2 + y 02 + \u03b4 2 )3/2\nThe integrand in (33) has a different singularity than that in (29). Indeed, for x = \u03b4 \u03b1 , the\ndominant contribution to (33) comes from the disks of radius \u03b4 around (0, 0) and (\u03b4 \u03b1 , 0)\nwhich is easily estimated to be\nKD (r, r0 ) \u223c \u03b4 1\u22123\u03b1 ,\n\n\u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1].\n\nBy contrast, KD (r0 , r0 ) \u223c \u03b4 \u22122 . Hence the focal spot size in this case is smaller than \u03b4 \u03b1 , \u2200\u03b1 \u2208\n[0, 1) asymptotically. We conclude that the focal spot size for the dipole TR is essentially\nO(\u03b4) and that the dipole TR can in principle break the diffraction limit to achieve an\narbitrarily fine resolution by bring the TRM sufficiently close to the source.\n9\n\n\f2\n\nRM\n\nRM\n\n1.3\n\nR\n\nD\n\n1.8\n\n1.2\n\nR\n\nMD\n\nR\n\n1.1\n\nR2DM\n\n1.6\n\n1\n\n1.4\n\n0.9\n\n0.8\n\n1.2\n0.7\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\nz\n\n1\n\nR\n\n0.6\n\n10\n!3\n\nx 10\n\n0.07\nRD\nR\n\n0.8\n\nMD\n\n0.06\n\n0.05\n\n0.6\n\n0.04\n\nR\n\n0.4\n0.03\n\n0.2\n\n0.02\n\n0.01\n\n0\n\n0\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\nz\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\nz\n\n!3\n\nx 10\n\n10\n!3\n\nx 10\n\nFigure 3.

By the same analysis as before, the\nintegrals (12) and (13) can be approximated by, respectively,\nZ\n1\n\u03b4\n(34)\n\u00d7\ndx0 dy 0\n02\n02\n2\n1/2\n0\n2\n02\n2\n3/2\n(x + y + \u03b4 )\n((x \u2212 x ) + y + \u03b4 )\nZ\n\u03b4\n1\n(35)\n\u00d7\ndx0 dy 0 .\n\u2212\n02\n02\n2\n3/2\n0\n2\n02\n2\n1/2\n(x + y + \u03b4 )\n((x \u2212 x ) + y + \u03b4 )\nSet x = \u03b4 \u03b1 , 0 \u2264 \u03b1 < 1. In the case of (34), the dominant contribution (\u223c \u03b4 \u2212\u03b1 ) comes from\nintegration around (\u03b4 \u03b1 , 0) for \u03b1 < 1 while, in the case of (35), the dominant contribution (\u223c\n\u03b4 \u2212\u03b1 ) comes from integration around (0, 0). In both cases KMD (r0 , r0 ) \u223c KDM (r0 , r0 ) \u223c \u03b4 \u22121 .\nHence the focal spot size is smaller than \u03b4 \u03b1 , \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1) asymptotically.\nWe conclude that the focal spot size for the mixed mode TR is essentially O(\u03b4) and that\nthe mixed mode TR can achieve an arbitrarily fine resolution as the TRM approaches the\npoint source. Moreover, the fact that the maximum values of the point-spread functions are\ninversely proportional to the focal spot size is consistent with the cut-off version of (23) in\nthe following sense. Truncate the Green function (26) at the level \u03b4 \u22121 as in (25). Then the\nasymptotic spot size of the resulting function is O(\u03b4). In other words, the mixed mode TR\nof near field recovers qualitatively the asymptotic behavior of the Green function near the\nsource point.\nWhen the superresolution terms from KDM and KMD combine in KPB , they cancel each\nother resulting in diffraction-limited focal spot.\nIn Figure 2 the normalized transverse and longitudinal profiles are shown and their resolutions calculated for various TR schemes. The profiles are normalized to be unity at the\nsource location. In the simulation, we use \u03bb = 2\u03c0, A = 2\u03bb and r0 = (0.01, 0, 0). Before\nnormalization, the KM curve has the maximum less than 0.5 and hence is far from the\nsquare-root asymptotic regime discussed in the paragraph following (32).\n10\n\n\f4.4.

The KD -resolution asymptotic is given by \u03b4 \u03b1 , \u03b1 = 1.\nFor the mixed mode, (34) and (35) become\nZ\n1\n\u03b4\n(37)\nlog (x02 + \u03b4 2 )\u22121/2 \u00d7\ndx0\n0\n2\n2\nk\n(x \u2212 x ) + \u03b4\nZ\n1\n\u03b4\n(38)\n\u2212\n\u00d7 log ((x \u2212 x0 )2 + \u03b4 2 )\u22121/2 dx0\n02\n2\nk\nx +\u03b4\nyielding\nKMD (r, r0 ), KDM (r, r0 ) \u223c \u03b1 (\u2212 log \u03b4)2 ,\n2\n\n\u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1]\n\nand KMD (r0 , r0 ), KDM (r0 , r0 ) \u223c (\u2212 log \u03b4) . Hence, the asymptotic resolution for the mixed\nmode TR is given by \u03b4 \u03b1 , \u03b1 = 1/2. Empirically, the square-root regime for the mixed mode TR\nin two dimensions sets in much earlier than the monopole TR in three dimensions. Here lies\nthe main difference between the two and three dimensional cases. Namely, in two dimensions\nthe transverse resolution for the mixed mode TR is proportional to the square-root of the\ndistance between the source and TRM.\nFor the monopole TR in two dimensions, KM is uniformly bounded w.r.t. \u03b4 and the\nresolution can not be deduced from the asymptotic analysis. It is likely though that the\nmonopole TR resolution is qualitatively independent of \u03b4. This is amply confirmed by our\nnumerical simulations (Figure 3).\nIn Figure 3 the transverse resolutions, denoted by RX , X = M, D, MD, DM, for the respective TR schemes as a function of the distance between the source and TRM are plotted for\nthe range [0.001, 0.01]. The dipole resolution RD exhibits the linear behavior in two and\nthree dimensions and the mixed mode resolution RMD , RDM exhibits the linear behavior in\nthree dimensions and square-root behavior in two dimensions. Both the dipole and mixed\nmode resolutions are order of magnitude better than the monopole resolution.\nIn Figure 4 the normalized transverse and longitudinal profiles in two dimensions are\nshown and FWHM calculated for various TR schemes with the same physical parameters as\nin Figure 2. The unnormalized transverse profile for the mixed mode TR has the maximum\nabout 6. The dipole resolution is much better than the mixed mode resolution which in\nturn is much better than the monopole resolution in both the transverse and longitudinal\ndirections.\nIn summary, in the case of a monopole source the dipole TR produces the best resolution in\nboth transverse and longitudinal directions, roughly in proportion to the distance between\nthe source and TRM. The mixed mode TR can deliver nearly the same performance in\nthree dimensions and roughly the square-root resolution in the transverse direction in two\ndimensions. Between the two mixed mode TR schemes, KMD is still better than KDM in the\nlongitudinal direction. A simple explanation for the superior resolution of TRM involving\n11\n\n\fmax half width: K :1.000 , K :0.009 , K\n\nmax half width: KM:1.870 , KD:0.050 , KMD:0.470 , KDM:0.470\n\nM\n\nD\n\n:0.148 , K\n\nMD\n\n:0.220\n\nDM\n\n1\n\n1\n\nK\n\nKM\n\nM\n\nKD\n\n0.9\n\nKD\n\n0.9\n\nK\n\nKMD\n\nMD\n\nK\n\nDM\n\n0.8\n\n0.7\n\n0.7\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0\n!1\n\n!0.8\n\n!0.6\n\n!0.4\n\n!0.2\n\n0\nx\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\nK\n\nDM\n\n0.8\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\nz\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\nFigure\n4.

Note that the transverse profiles for the KMD and KDM coincide.\nthe dipole field is that a dipole source has a stronger singularity than a monopole source (cf.\n(27) versus (26))\n5. Approximate TR is biased\nWe have already seen that the perfect TR described by (7) with G = G0 is diffractionlimited and contains no evanescent component of the initial outgoing field (see the remark\nfollowing (24)).\nFor the half space (domain (iii) of Figure 1), the result is similar: Suppose the initial wave\nfield is perfectly phase-conjugated on the TRM (i.e. the boundary condition (21) is satisfied\nexactly by, say, the scheme KMD ). Then in the interior of the half space the homogenous\ncomponents of the initial wave are perfectly phase-conjugated but the evanescent components\nare exponentially damped by the factor\n\u221a2 2\ne\u22122kz s1 +s2 \u22121 , s21 + s22 > 1\ndepending on the distance z from the TRM to the field point (z, x) (Appendix C).\nOn the other hand, for the paraxial wave (45), perfect phase conjugation on one plane\nimplies perfect phase conjugation in the half space due to the fact that the paraxial wave\nfield is uniquely determined by the direction of propagation and the initial condition on\none plane (Appendix C). As a consequence, vM and KM are perfect TR schemes in their\nrespective contexts. In particular, KM can focus perfectly back on the location of the point\nsource in the paraxial approximation.\nThe perfect focusing of time reversed paraxial wave is, of course, unphysical because the\nevanescent waves are not accounted for. The other aspect that is more impractical than\nunphysical with the perfect conjugation of the homogeneous component of the spherical\nwave, is that an infinite aperture (A = R2 ) is required for such a result.\nIn this section, we show that when D is a half space and A is bounded, the maximum\npoint of the TR focal spot does not correspond to the exact source location r0 in general.\n12\n\n\fIn contrast, when A = R2 in the paraxial regime, since KM is a perfect TR scheme for the\nparaxial wave, the focal spot is always centered.\nThis bias effect tends to be much more pronounced in the longitudinal direction. As the\naperture of TRM increases, the transverse offset (bias) decreases while the longitudinal offset\nmay persist if there is insufficient scattering in the medium, cf. Section 6. This is why we\nconsider only the transverse resolution in the previous section.\nLet us recast the problem in more general terms. Let \u03c6(r, r0 ) be the phase of G(r, r0 ) and\ndefine\nZ\n2\n\u2217 0\ni\u03c6(r,r0 )\n0\n0\n(39)\nPM (r) =\nG (r , r0 )e\nW (r, r )d\u03c3(r )\nA\n0\n\nwhere W (r, r ) is a non-negative function. The monopole TR kernel KM corresponds to\nW (r, r0 ) = |G(r, r0 )|.\nDirect calculation of \u2207PM (r0 ) yields\n\u2207PM (r0 )\nZ\n=\n|G\u2217 (r0 , r0 )||G(r00 , r0 )|W (r0 , r0 )W (r0 , r00 )(i\u2207\u03c6(r0 , r0 ) \u2212 i\u2207\u03c6(r0 , r00 ))d\u03c3(r0 )d\u03c3(r00 )\nA\u00d7A\nZ\n+\n|G\u2217 (r0 , r0 )||G(r00 , r0 )|\u2207 (W (r, r0 )W (r, r00 ))r=r0 d\u03c3(r0 )d\u03c3(r00 ).\nA\u00d7A\n\nThe first term vanishes due to anti-symmetry with respect to r0 , r00 .\nConsider the case of a planar TRM on the plane z = 0 with the paraxial wave propagating\nin the z-direction (Appendix A). Suppose the medium inhomogeneities act like a phase object\naffecting only the phase of the free propagator. Namely, G(z, x, z 0 , x0 ) takes the form\n(40)\n\nG(z, x, z 0 , x0 ) = \u2212\n\nk|x\u2212x0 |2\n1\nik(z\u2212z 0 ) i 2(z\u2212z0 ) i\u03b8(z,x,z 0 ,x0 )\ne\ne\ne\n,\n4\u03c0(z \u2212 z 0 )\n\nx, x0 \u2208 R2 .\n\nNote that for (40) the expression (39) is divergent and thus invalid at r = r0 if A = R2 .\nFor a finite aperture, W (r, r0 ) = (4\u03c0|z \u2212 z 0 |)\u22121 and thus \u2207 (W (r, r0 )W (r, r00 ))r=r0 points\nin the negative z direction and consequently r0 tends to be farther away from A than the\nmaximum point of PM . In other words, the focal spot of the monopole TR tends to be closer\nto A than the source location. Even in the case of a closed cavity the offset (bias) is reduced\nbut not completely eliminated except for special cases.\nNow let us change the perspective and think of TR as a means of imaging a point source\nin a perfectly known medium. In this context a few widely used W (r, r0 )'s are:\nW (r, r0 ) = |G(r, r0 )|\u22121\nsZ\n\nW (r, r0 ) = W (r0 )/\n\n(the inverse filter),\n|W (r00 )|2 d\u03c3(r00 ), \u2200W \u2208 L2 (A, d\u03c3) (the phase processor),\n\nA\n\nsZ\nW (r, r0 ) = |G(r, r0 )|/\n|G(r, r00 )|2 d\u03c3(r00 )\n\n(the conventional matched field processor).\n\nA\n\nFor the inverse filter, \u2207(W (r, r0 )W (r, r00 ))r=r0 and thus \u2207PM (r0 ) tend to point away from\nthe TR mirror A and hence the source location tends to be closer to A than the maximum\npoint of PM . Again, when A = \u2202D or in the far field regime this offset can be reduced.\n13\n\n\fDirect substitution shows that \u2207PM (r0 ) = 0 for the two latter choices of W . Moreover,\nr0 is the maximum point of PM for both choices of W . In the case of the W -weighted phase\nprocessor, we clearly have\nZ\n|G\u2217 (r0 , r0 )|W (r0 )d\u03c3(r0 ) = PM (r0 ).\nPM (r) \u2264\nA\n\nIn the case of the conventional matched field processing, it is well known [2, 25] that\nsZ\nV (r0 , r0 ) = G(r0 , r0 )/\n(41)\n|G(r0 , r0 )|2 d\u03c3(r0 )\nA\n\nis the solution to the optimization problem: Maximize the quantity\nZ\n2\nG\u2217 (r0 , r0 )V (r0 )d\u03c3(r0 )\nA\n\nover V subject to the constraint\nZ\n(42)\n\n|V |2 (r0 )d\u03c3(r0 ) = 1.\n\nTherefore\nZ\nPM (r) =\n\nG\u2217 (r0 , r0 )V (r, r0 )d\u03c3(r0 )\n\nA\n\nis maximized at r = r0 with the conventional matched field processing.\nIn summary, as an imaging method both TR and the inverse filter are generally biased; the\nformer tends to underestimate the range of the source while the latter tends to overestimate\nit. The conventional matched field processor is unbiased and produces the optimal signalto-noise ratio. The phase processor, which uses only the phase of the Green function, is a\nsimple alternative to the conventional matched field processor.\nMoreover, in the regime described by (40), |G(r, r0 )| is a function of the distance between\nthe source point and the TRM. In such a case the conventional matched field processor\ncoincides with the phase processor with W (r0 ) = IA /|A|1/2 independent of r0 .\nSimilar conclusions can be drawn for the pure dipole case with\nZ\n2\n\u2202G\u2217 (r0 , r0 ) i\u03c8(r,r0 )\n0\n0\n(43)\nPD (r) =\ne\nW (r, r )d\u03c3(r )\n\u2202n\nA\nwhere \u03c8(r, r0 ) is the phase of \u2202G(r, r0 )/\u2202n. PD can be analyzed as above with G replaced by\nits normal derivative.\nFor KMD , KDM , consider the paraxial regime for which (19) is valid. Each term on the\nright hand side of (19) can be analyzed as before. The result is that the mixed mode TR's\nare biased, especially in the longitudinal direction, just like the monopole and dipole TR's.\n6. Randomness eliminates bias\nIn this section, we explain how randomness can make the TR focal spot centered at the\nlocation of the source point.\nConsider typical profiles of the Green function in a multiple scattering medium as depicted in Figure 5. A main feature of the intensity profiles is the rapid fluctuations in the\n14\n\n\f(\n\n!'!\"&\n\n0.03\n\n)*++(,-../01(2*/3456/\n)-..!1783.(,-../01(2*/3456/\n\nFull Green's function\nFree!space Green's function\n0.025\n\n0.02\n\n!'!\"\n\n0.015\n\n0.01\n\n!'!!&\n\n0.005\n\n!(\n!\n\n0\n1000\n\n\"!!!\n\n#!!!\n\n$!!!\n\n%!!!\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\n2500\n\n3000\n\n3500\n\n4000\n\n4500\n\n5000\n\n&!!!\n\nFigure 5.

If the spatial spread increases to infinity, then the TRM\nacquires an effective aperture that is proportional to the spatial spread [4, 15]. Then, as per\ndiscussion at the beginning of Section 5, the accuracy of approximate TR's improve and the\nfocal spot becomes more centered and sharper.\nMoreover, counterintuitively, the TR image can avoid statistical fluctuations if the medium\nis sufficiently random. Let us recall some analytical results from the literature.\nConsider TR in a random medium occupying a half space with TRM on the planar boundary. When the random channel is the Rayleigh fading regime (i.e. obeying zero-mean Gaussian statistics) with a divergent spatial spread the monopole TR (10) with TRM's aperture\nmuch larger than the coherence length `c will focus on the source point with a spot size\n\u223c `c [13, 14]. The conventional coherence theory suggests that the coherence length is of\nthe order of wavelength [23]. However, spatial correlations of much smaller extent has been\nrecently measured in the near field of random media [1]. This effect in conjunction with the\npreceding theory may be the key to understanding the subwavelength focusing observed in\nthe time reversal experiment reported in [21].\nThe result of stability and focusing is a special case of what was originally established for\nthe setting of multiple frequencies and multiple source points [13, 14]. With straightforward\nmodification of the arguments in [13, 14] the same result can be extended to any TR of the\ntypes (10)-(13) in the paraxial regime, the only difference being in the asymptotic shape\n15\n\n\fof the focal spot. Experiments show consistently similar results on stability and focusing\nproperties [17, 21, 27].\nIn conclusion, random fluctuations in the intensity of Green's function is a necessary\ncondition for the desired focusing property of time reversal with a finite aperture.\n7. Conclusion\nWe have reexamined various time reversal schemes that can be employed from the boundary of a domain; they involve monopole and/or dipole fields.\nWe have explored their relationships in the paraxial regime. For the boundary behavior,\nwe show that for paraxial wave only the monopole TR scheme satisfies the exact boundary\ncondition while for the spherical wave only the MD-mode TR scheme satisfies the exact\nboundary condition. We have also shown that for the paraxial wave the standard monopole\nTRM produces the perfect result in the entire domain but for the near field the monopole\nTRM can hardly achieve subwavelength focusing. On the other hand, the dipole TRM is\napproximate in the paraxial regime but is capable of producing a focal spot size linearly\nproportional to the distance from TRM to the source location, thus focusing on a subwavelength scale when the TRM is sufficiently close to the source point. The mixed mode TRM\nhas the similar (linear) behavior in three dimensions but the square-root asymptotic in two\ndimensions. The monopole TRM is, if possible at all, ineffective to focus below wavelength.\nWe have seen how two mixed mode effects combine in the so called perfect TR scheme\nfor a closed cavity and cancel their respective subwavelength focusing property. The perfect\nTRM is \"perfect\" only for a source-free initial field.\nWe have examined an often neglected effect of biased focusing associated with TRM of\na finite aperture in a weak- or non-scattering medium. This effect pertains to all five TR\nschemes discussed in the paper. In a multiply scattering medium, the bias is greatly reduced\nand the focal spot becomes centered at the source location. The removal of bias by random\nscattering is attributed to the enlarged effective aperture and the random fluctuations in the\nintensity of the Green function.\nAppendix A. Mixed mode TR for paraxial wave\nLet z \u2208 R be the longitudinal coordinate and x \u2208 R2 the transverse coordinates.

In other\nwords, only the monopole TR gives the correct boundary values in the case of paraxial wave\npropagating in the half space.\nB.2. Spherical wave.

Assume\nG = G0 , the free space Green function.\nDifferentiating the Weyl representation for G0 with respect to z 0 , we find that\n1\n\u2202\n0\n0\n(50)\nG\n(z,\nx,\nz\n,\nx\n)\n|\n\u03b4(x \u2212 x0 ).\n0 =0 =\n0\nz=z\n\u2202z 0\n2\nFrom (50) it is immediately clear that\n1\n1\nvMD (0, x) = u\u2217 (0, x), KMD (0, x) = G\u2217 (0, x, z0 , x0 ).\n2\n2\nHowever, neither vDM nor KDM satisfies the boundary condition as we show now.\nIn the neighborhood of A, the wave field u in D can be represented in terms of the plane\nwave spectrum:\nZ\nZ\nik(s1 x+s2 y) iks3 z\n(51)u(x, y, z) =\nds1 ds2 e\ne\nA(s1 , s2 ) + ds1 ds2 eik(s1 x+s2 y) e\u2212iks3 z B(s1 , s2 )\nwhere s3 is given in (24). Consider for simplicity one-way wave with, say, B \u2261 0. Then the\nphase-conjugated field has the form\nZ\n\u2217\nu (x, y, z) =\nds1 ds2 eik(s1 x+s2 y) e\u2212iks3 z A\u2217 (\u2212s1 , \u2212s2 )\n2\n2\ns1 +s2 \u22641\nZ\n+\nds1 ds2 eik(s1 x+s2 y) eiks3 z A\u2217 (\u2212s1 , \u2212s2 )\ns21 +s22 >1\n\nand thus\nZ\nh\ni\n\u2202 \u2217\nu (x, y, 0) = ik ds1 ds2 eik(s1 x+s2 y) s3 A\u2217 (\u2212s1 , \u2212s2 ) \u2212I{s21 +s22 \u22641} + I{s21 +s22 >1} .\n\u2202z\nwhere IS is the indicator function of the set S. By Plancherel's identity we obtain\nZ\nh\ni\nvDM (0, x) = 2\u03c0 ds1 ds2 eik(s1 x+s2 y) A\u2217 (\u2212s1 , \u2212s2 ) \u2212I{s21 +s22 \u22641} + I{s21 +s22 >1}\n6= 2\u03c0u\u2217 (0, x).\nNamely, no constant multiple of vDM satisfies the boundary condition.\n18\n\n\fLikewise, one can show that none of the other TR schemes than vMD , KMD satisfies the\nboundary condition, with some adjustable constant factor.\nAppendix C. One-plane TRM in a half space\nConsider the half space D = {z > 0} with A = {z = 0} and point source located at\n(z0 , x0 ), z0 > 0, Figure 6. We assume that the medium inhomogeneities n2 \u2212 1 is away from\nthe TRM so that the gap D\u2212 is a non-empty infinite slab. Figure 6.\nFirst we observe that for the paraxial wave, perfect phase conjugation on z = 0 implies\nperfect phase conjugation throughout the domain D. This can be shown as follows.\nLet u(z, x) = e\u2212ikz \u03a8\u2212 (z, x) be the initial wave propagating in the negative z direction\nwhere \u03a8\u2212 satisfies (45) with the minus sign. If u(0, x) is perfectly conjugated by, say, either\nthe scheme described by vM or vPB , then the resulting field, denoted by v(z, x), is given by\nv(z, x) = eikz \u03a8+ (z, x)\nwhere \u03a8+ satisfies (45) with the plus sign and the initial condition\n\u03a8+ (0, x) = \u03a8\u2212\u2217 (0, x).\nNow since \u03a8\u2212\u2217 (z, x) satisfies (45) with the plus sign and the initial condition \u03a8+ (0, x), we\nhave from the uniqueness theorem for the initial value problem of (45) that\n\u03a8+ (z, x) = \u03a8\u2212\u2217 (z, x)\nand consequently\nv(z, x) = u\u2217 (z, x),\n\nz > 0.\n\nThe same argument and conclusion apply to the paraxial wave with a point source.\nThe case with the spherical wave is similar but more subtle since the evanescent wave is\ninvolved. It can be shown that the Green function in D\u2212 \u2229 {z < z0 } can be expressed as\nsuperposition of plane waves propagating in the negative z direction\nZ\n(52)\nG(r, r0 ) = ds1 ds2 eik(s1 x+s2 y) e\u2212iks3 z B(s1 , s2 ), r \u2208 D\u2212 \u2229 {z < z0 }\nin analogy to (51).\nLet W be a source-free field propagating across z = 0 into D and be represented as\nZ\n(53)\nW (r) = ds1 ds2 eik(s1 x+s2 y) eiks3 z A(s1 , s2 ), r \u2208 D\u2212 .\nNote the sign in the exponent associated with z here is different from that in (52) since\nthey propagate in the opposite directions. Suppose W is the phase conjugate field of G at\nz = 0, i.e. W \u2217 (x, y, 0) = G(x, y, 0, r0 ), \u2200x, y. For z = 0, equating (53) with (52) conjugated\nwe obtain the condition\n(54)\n\nA(s1 , s2 ) = B \u2217 (\u2212s1 , \u2212s2 ).\n\nThis result is first observed in [22].\nLet WH and WE be, respectively, the homogeneous and the evanescent components of W ,\ncorresponding to, respectively, the integration (53) restricted to s21 + s22 \u2264 1 and s21 + s22 > 1.\n19\n\n\f*r0\n-\n\n+\n\nD\n\nD\n\nz=0\n\nFigure 6. The dark area represents the scattering domain S. The asterisk,\n\u2217, represents the source point r0 which may be anywhere in D.\nThe homogeneous and the evanescent components GH , GI of (52) are defined analogously.\nThen (54) lead to, respectively,\n(55)\n(56)\n\nWH\u2217 (r) = GH (r), r \u2208 D\u2212\nZ\n\u221a2 2\n\u2217\nWI (r) =\nds1 ds2 eik(s1 x+s2 y) e\u2212kz s1 +s2 \u22121 B(s1 , s2 ),\n\nr \u2208 D\u2212 .\n\nIn other words, the homogenous components of the initial wave is perfectly phase-conjugated\nbut the evanescent components are exponentially damped by the factor\n\u221a2 2\ne\u22122kz s1 +s2 \u22121\ndepending on the distance from the TRM to the field point.\nAcknowledgement.
