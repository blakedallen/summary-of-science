A lot of literature deal with the manipulator singularities [2] [17] [8] [13] [10] [16] [14] [12] [3] [11] [15]\nand references therein. The kinematics of manipulator can be described as a smooth map:\n\u03a6 : X 7\u2192 Y\nwhere X denotes the space of joint variables (x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 x6 ) for 6R manipulator and Y is the workspace\nof positions and orientations of the end-effector. Manipulator with m revolte joint, the joint space is\nX = Tm\nwhere T m denotes the m-dimensional torus. The workspace Y can be special euclidean group SE(3):\nSE(3) \u2261 SO(3) \u00d7 R3\nwhich is a Lie group, that is a semidirect product of the special orthogonal group SO(3) and R3 . From the\nmap \u03a6 we can work out the Jacobian, which is the linear map k on the tangent spaces:\nk : Rm 7\u2192 Rn\nwhere m is the dimension of joint space and n is the dimension of workspace, in this paper m = n = 6. The\nJacobian J will be related to:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03c9\n= J \u1e8a\nv\nwhere \u03c9 is the angular velocity of the end-effector, v is the velocity of the end-effector and \u1e8a is the joint\nrate. Let r = rank(J), then the singular set for the map k can be defined as:\nSk = {x \u2208 Rm | r < min(m, n)}\nThe singular set can also be decomposed into strata [7] [12]:\nmin(m,n)\n\nSk =\n\n[\n\nc=1\n\n1\n\nSc\n\n\fwhere\nSc = {x \u2208 Rm | r = min(m, n) \u2212 c}\nwhere the number c is called the corank of the map k. A manipulator is said generic if its singularities are\ngeneric, that is, if they form smooth manifolds in joint space. Non-generic manipulaters often arise from\ngeometric simplication condition in the structue. Generic manipulators have only ordinary singularities [2]\n[17] [10], that is, the singular set (manifolds) behaves like a regular surface, i.e., corank c = 1. In this paper,\nwe deal with generic 6R manipulators. So the higher order singularities do not exist for this kind of 6R\nmanipulators, which can be interpreted as bifurcation. In fact, all possible singular configurations are the\nzero set of det(J):\ndet(J) = 0\nAfter some algebraic manipulation, letting q1 = tan(x1 /2), q2 = tan(x2 /2), q3 = tan(x3 /2), q4 = tan(x4 /2),\nq5 = tan(x5 /2), q6 = tan(x6 /2), above equation can be converted to the form:\nf1 (q2 , q3 , q4 )q58 + . . . = 0\nor\nf2 (q2 , q3 , q5 )q410 + . . . = 0\nor\nf3 (q2 , q4 , q5 )q312 + . . . = 0\nor\nf4 (q3 , q4 , q5 )q214 + . . . = 0\nThe result is too complicated to be displayed here. We just show the first term of the equation. In above\nequations, we use Denavit-Hartenberg parameters. The above equations may have \"zero at infinity\" (singularities at infinity). We do not pay extra attention to it since these singularities are a part of the generic\nsingular surface. Since above equations are independent of q1 and q6 , the singular surface is projected onto\ntorus T 4 . The singular surface forms branches, i.e., the connected components, on the surface of T 4 . In the\nfollowing section we will classify the manipulator by the singular surface forming branches, which are the\ngroup of homotopy class in T 4 .\n\n2\n\nA Classification of 6R Manipulators\n\nSingular surface can be characterized by their fundemental group of homotopy class in T 4 . The fundemental\ngroup of T 4 is the group of loop equivalence classes, denoted by \u03c01 (T 4 ) [9]:\n\u03c01 (T 4 ) = \u03c01 (T 2 ) \u00d7 \u03c01 (T 2 ) = Z \u00d7 Z \u00d7 Z \u00d7 Z\nwhere Z is the set of integer. Each element of \u03c01 (T 4 ), which is a set of homotopicly equivalent singular\nsurfaces, can be labeled by integers (I2 ,I3 ,I4 ,I5 ), which characterize how many integral times the \"curve\"\n\"wrap around\" the generator of T 4 . It is known a class of 6R manipulators which have the same homotopy\nclass will have similar topological properties in the their joint spaces. Singular manifolds can divide the joint\nspace of 6R manipulator in at least two singularity-free domain called c-sheets. A single singular manifold\nbranch, which can cut the joint space into two c-sheets, is said to be separating; otherwise, it is said nonseparating, which must combine with other branch to divide the joint space. In the following, we enumerate\nthe branch homotopy classes.\n(1) (0,0,0,0) homotopy class: the branch is separating and can appear alone. The result is due to the\ntopology of the torus.\n(2) 2(0,0,0,0), 3(0,0,0,0) and 4(0,0,0,0) homotopy classes: the branches are separating.\n\n2\n\n\fBut more than 4 coexisting (0,0,0,0) branches would yield more than 8 intersections with the generator,\nhere 8 is the minimum of the maximum allowable times around the generator. (1,0,0,0) or (0,1,0,0) or\n(0,0,1,0) or (0,0,0,1) cannot divide the torus, so they cannot appear alone. (I2 ,0,0,0) or (0,I3 ,0,0) or\n(0,0,I4 ,0) or (0,0,0,I5 ), when I2 > 1 or I3 > 1 or I4 > 1 or I5 > 1, are impossible because these helical\ncurves must go backward, which cannot be done without self intersections. Since\n\u03c01 (T 4 ) = \u03c01 (T 2 ) \u00d7 \u03c01 (T 2 ), we can consider the singular surfaces have two branches each of which is on one\ntorus T 2 . Possible two branches are (I2 ,I3 ,0,0) + (0,0,I4 ,I5 ), here I2 \u2264 12, I3 \u2264 14, I4 \u2264 8, and I5 \u2264 10,\nbecause the degrees of q2 , q3 , q4 , and q5 in the equation det(J) = 0 set up the maximum allowable times for\nI2 , I3 , I4 , and I5 around the generator of T 2 . But either (I2 ,I3 ,0,0) or (0,0,I4 ,I5 ) cannot be separating\nbecause they form helical closed bands. In paper [17], there are eight homotopy classes for torus T 2 , that\nis, (0,0), 2(0,0), (0,0)+2(1,0), 2(1,0), 4(1,0), 2(0,1), 2(1,1), and 2(2,1). We denote these classes to be H2.\nSo following classes are homotopy classes which are separating branches:\n(3) (H2,0,0) + (0,0,I4 ,I5 ), (I2 ,I3 ,0,0) + (0,0,H2) and (H2,0,0) + (0,0,H2) homotopy classes: the branches\nare separating.\nFor the torus T 2 mentioned in this paper, there are more separating homotopy classes. For torus\n(I2 ,I3 ,0,0), (11,14,0,0) + (1,0,0,0), (10,14,0,0) + 2(1,0,0,0), (9,14,0,0) + 3(1,0,0,0), (8,14,0,0) + 4(1,0,0,0),\n(7,14,0,0) + 5(1,0,0,0), (6,14,0,0) + 6(1,0,0,0), (5,14,0,0) + 7(1,0,0,0), (4,14,0,0) + 8(1,0,0,0), (3,14,0,0) +\n9(1,0,0,0), (2,14,0,0) + 10(1,0,0,0), (1,14,0,0) + 11(1,0,0,0) and (12,13,0,0) + (0,1,0,0), (12,12,0,0) +\n2(0,1,0,0), (12,11,0,0) + 3(0,1,0,0), (12,10,0,0) + 4(0,1,0,0), (12,9,0,0) + 5(0,1,0,0), (12,8,0,0) + 6(0,1,0,0),\n(12,7,0,0) + 7(0,1,0,0), (12,6,0,0) + 8(0,1,0,0), (12,5,0,0) + 9(0,1,0,0), (12,4,0,0) + 10(0,1,0,0), (12,3,0,0) +\n11(0,1,0,0), (12,2,0,0) + 12(0,1,0,0), (12,1,0,0) + 13(0,1,0,0). are separating homotopy classes. We denote\nthese classes to be H3. Similarly, for torus (0,0,I4 ,I5 ), (0,0,7,10) + (0,0,1,0), (0,0,6,10) + 2(0,0,1,0),\n(0,0,5,10) + 3(0,0,1,0), (0,0,4,10) + 4(0,0,1,0), (0,0,3,10) + 5(0,0,1,0), (0,0,2,10) + 6(0,0,1,0), (0,0,1,10) +\n7(0,0,1,0) and (0,0,8,9) + (0,0,0,1), (0,0,8,8) + 2(0,0,0,1), (0,0,8,7) + 3(0,0,0,1), (0,0,8,6) + 4(0,0,0,1),\n(0,0,8,5) + 5(0,0,0,1), (0,0,8,4) + 6(0,0,0,1), (0,0,8,3) + 7(0,0,0,1), (0,0,8,2) + 8(0,0,0,1), (0,0,8,1) +\n9(0,0,0,1). are separating homotopy classes. We denote these classes to be H4. So,\n(4) H3 and H4 homotopy classes: the branches are separating.\nThere are other combinations such as (0,0,6,8) + (0,0,1,0) etc. we cannot enumerate here. But the\ncombination like (0,0,7,9) + (0,0,1,0) + (0,0,0,1) would lead to intersecting branches: (0,0,1,0) and\n(0,0,0,1), and it cannot exist. In fact, in order to get a class of 6R manipulators which have the same\nhomotopy class, i.e., to get a set of parameters of the manipulators, we must solve the equation det(J) = 0\nunder some conditions. For example, for (0,0,0,0) homotopy class, we must solve above equation to get a\nset of parameters under the conditions:\n\u2212\u03c0 < q2 < \u03c0\n\u2212\u03c0 < q3 < \u03c0\n\u2212\u03c0 < q4 < \u03c0\n\u2212\u03c0 < q5 < \u03c0\nand for 2(0,0,0,0) homotopy class, we must solve equation det(J) = 0 to get two branches solution and a\nset of parameters under above conditions. There are still a lot of combinations we cannot enumerate here.\nIt indicates the complexity of the joint space of 6R manipulator. Recently, there are some papers [6] [5] [1]\n[4] dealing with the topological properties of manipulators, but we still have little understanding of the\ntopological properties of joint space and workspace of the manipulator.\n\nReferences\n[1] C.
