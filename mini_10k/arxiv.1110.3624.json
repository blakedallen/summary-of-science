The magnetocaloric\neffect is associated with the temperature change of a magnetic material due\nto a change of the magnetization under applied magnetic fields. Magnetocaloric materials are intensively studied because of the potential use for\ncooling and heating applications. The primary advantage of magnetocaloric\nmaterials, as opposed to conventional vapor-cycle based technology, is the\ntwo orders of magnitude larger entropy density in a solid near its transition\ntemperature compared to a gaseous medium and an efficiency of the magnetic cycle closer to the Carnot limit [3]. Nevertheless, to use that potential\nin an environmentally friendly and energy efficient way, materials not based\non expensive, toxic and rare elements are needed.\nMelanostibite is a mineral found in Sj\u00f6gruvan (\u00d6rebro, Sweden) and was\nfirst described by Lars Johan Igelstr\u00f6m [4] in 1892. The name melanostibite\nreflects on the color (melanos = black in greek) and composition (stibium =\nantimony in latin) of the material. Melanostibite is a Mn-Sb-oxide with chemical formula Mn2 FeSbO6 consisting of abundant elements and has a hexagonal crystal structure with space group R3\u0304, which is an isostructural to the\nilmenite-pyrofanite group [5]. The octahedral representation of ilmenite-type\nstructure is shown in Figure 1. In this structure Mn and Fe/Sb are ordered in\nlayers along the c-axis, whereas Fe and Sb are completely disordered within a\nFe/Sb layer. Recently, it has been shown that Mn2 FeSbO6 mineral exhibits a\nferrimagnetic ordering near 270 K brought forth by the Mn2+ and Fe3+ ions\nin the structure [6]. The magnetic transition in Mn2 FeSbO6 is evident from\nmagnetization measurements in low magnetic fields. Nevertheless, its order\nand the magnetic properties in higher magnetic fields have not been studied\nyet. A magnetic phase transition close to room temperature and the layered\nmagnetic structure suggesting that this material could give rise to interesting\nmagnetocaloric properties near room temperature. Magnetocaloric oxide materials with perovskite-type structure have been intensively studied [7, 8, 9].\nTo this date there is only a small number of known materials with ilmenitetype structure and a magnetic transition close to room temperature [10]. No\nstudy of their magnetocaloric properties have been reported.\nIn this article we report on the magnetic phase transition and the magnetocaloric properties of both mineral and synthetic Mn2 FeSbO6 with ilmenitetype structure. Our results are based on magnetic- and specific heat measurements. The magnetic entropy changes \u2206SM for the mineral (synthetic)\nmelanostibite sample was found to be 1.7 (1.8) J/kgK and 0.51 (0.46) J/kgK\nfor field changes of 5 and 1 Tesla, respectively. Although \u2206SM is relatively\n2\n\n\fFigure 1: (Color online) Octahedral representation of the melanostibite crystal lattice with\nilmenite structure; along c-axis (upper panel) and in ab-plane direction (lower panel).\n\nsmall compared to reference magnetocaloric materials such as Gd, we believe\nthat our results indicate that new materials based on ferri-/ferromagnetic\nilmenites such as Mn2 FeSbO6 with improved magnetocaloric properties near\nroom-temperature could be designed.\n2. Experimental methods\nSynthetic Mn2 FeSbO6 samples were fabricated using conventional solid\nstate reaction (including terminatory sintering at temperatures between 1300\nand 1350 \u25e6 C) and thermobaric treatment under a pressure of 3 GPa at 1000\n\u25e6\nC for 30 min. Detailed synthesis conditions are reported in Ref. Mathieu\net al. [6] and Bazuev et al. [11]. The phase composition of the synthetic\nsamples was studied using powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) method on a D8\nBruker diffractometer with CuK\u03b11 radiation. The ICDD PDF4 database\nof standard powder patterns (ICDD, USA, Release 2009) was used to identify possible impurity phases. The cation stoichiometry of the mineral and\nsynthetic samples was checked using microprobe EDX analysis (average of\n3\n\n\fFigure 2: X-ray diffraction pattern and Rietveld refinement (Rp =5.64%, Rwp =7.32%, and\nR\u03b2 =3.18%) for synthetic melanostibite at 295 K.\n\n20 points). Magnetization measurements for all samples were done using\na SQUID magnetometer (MPMS-XL) from Quantum Design Inc (QD). For\nthe magnetization measurements of the natural sample several small (\u224810500 \u03bcm) crystals of the mineral melanostibite were assembled together(total\nweight of 3.7 mg). Specific heat measurements were performed using a relaxation method on a Physical Properties Measurement System (QD PPMS\n6000).\nIncidentally, the melanostibite mineral was found ten years after the discovery of the magnetocaloric effect by E. Warburg in 1881 [12]. The magnetocaloric effect is related to the coupling of the spin system with the lattice\nvibrations of the material and can be represented by the change of magnetic\npart of the total entropy \u2206SM .\nFor an adiabatic magnetization process the change of the magnetic entropy part causes an identical change in the lattice part of the total entropy evident as a change in temperature \u2206Tad [13]. The magnetic entropy change\nfor a magnetic material undergoing a second-order magnetic phase transition can indeed be derived from Maxwell-relations [14].

Analyzing the slope of data plotted as\nM 2 vs. H/M indicates the order of phase transition (Banerjee criterion)\n[17]. A positive slope implies a second-order-continuous phase transition,\nwhereas an S-shaped negative slope suggests a first-order-discontinous phase\ntransition.\n3. Results and discussion\nAn X-ray diffraction pattern for synthetic melanostibite is shown in Figure 2. The main phase of the synthesized sample crystallizes in the hexagonal\nilmenite-type structure (space group R3\u0304, a = 5.237(1) \u00c5 and c = 14.349(2)\n\u00c5) similar to the single-crystal mineral of Mn2 FeSbO6 . From Rietveld refinement,with R-factors Rp =5.64%, Rwp =7.32%, and R\u03b2 =3.18%, a minor\n6\n\n\famount (\u2248 2%) of a secondary phase of the MnFe2 O4 spinel, which is ferrimagnetic below TN =570 K, was estimated.\nIn Figure 3, the magnetization curves for a mineral (black curve) and a\nsynthetic sample (blue curve) of melanostibite are shown. In small magnetic\nfields (2 mT) both mineral and synthetic Mn2 FeSbO6 show a sharp phase\ntransition. The transition temperature for the mineral is found to be \u223c268\nK and for the synthetic sample slightly lower at \u223c264 K. The low temperature\nmagnetization for a 5 Tesla field revealed a moment of about 3.7 \u03bcB /f.u. for\nthe mineral and 4.35 \u03bcB /f.u. (63.1 Am2 /kg) for the synthetic melanostibite\nat 10 K and is in agreement with a ferrimagnetic arrangement of 2 Mn2+\nand 1 Fe3+ cations (all carrying S = 5/2, 5 \u03bcB ) per formula unit [6]. For\na magnetic field of 1 T, Figure 3b, the transition appears broader and the\nmagnetization is increasing linearly below T N due to the ferrimagnetic type\nordering.

Isothermal magnetization\ndata and Arrott plots for both the mineral and synthetic melanostibite are\nshown in Figure 4. As can be seen in Figure 4b and 4d a positive slope in the\nentire data range and therefore a second order nature of the magnetic phase\ntransition is evident for both the melanostibite mineral and synthetic sample\n(Banerjee criterion). Furthermore, the presented data feature a set of parallel\nstraight lines around the transition temperature which indicate a mean-fieldlike behavior of the phase transition. For the mineral melanostibite, the\nbehavior of the data is fairly linear as indicated by red line (linear fit) shown\nin Figure 4b. In contrast, some discrepancies presumably due to the presence\nof the secondary MnFe2 O4 phase, were observed for the synthetic sample.\nThe MnFe2 O4 phase, as uncovered by our Rietveld analysis, is also evident in\nthe isothermal magnetization data as a hysteresis background at the highest\ntemperature of 288 K in Figure 4d. This is considerably above the transition\ntemperature of the melanostibite main phase.\nThe magnetocaloric properties for the mineral are displayed in Figure\n5a. Melanostibite undergoes a second-order phase transition, hence the peak\npk\n\u2206SM\nin the magnetic entropy change as function of temperature occurs at\nthe phase transition temperature and is not shifted with increasing magnetic\nfield changes. Nonetheless, the transition was found to be quite sharp and\nthe magnetic entropy change \u2206SM is estimated to be 1.7 J/kgK and 0.51\nJ/kgK for magnetic field changes of 5 T and 1 T, respectively. The magnetic entropy change for the synthetic sample can be seen in Figure 5b. The\nmagnetic entropy change for the synthetic sample under a magnetic field\nchange of 5 T and 1 T was found to be 1.8 J/kgK and 0.46 J/kgK, respectively. Hence, both samples show comparable values for the magnetic entropy\nchange of the order of 2 J/kgK for a magnetic field change of 5 T. Interestingly, Mn2 FeSbO6 crystallizes in a layered structure (c.f. Fig. 1) in which\nthe inter-layer coupling of the Mn and Fe/Sb layers is antiferromagnetic,\nwhereas the intra-layer coupling is ferromagnetic. It is well know that the\ncarrier doping and associated chemical pressure may change the inter-layer\ncoupling towards a ferromagnetic behavior, e.g. in perovskite manganites\n[18]. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that cation substitution could be\nemployed to enhance the ferromagnetic interaction in Mn2 FeSbO6 , yielding\nimproved magnetocaloric properties.\nThe magnetic field dependence of the magnetocaloric response is shown in\nFigure 6.

The \u2206SM curve from specific heat measurements was shifted with\na constant offset to match the \u2206SM at 290 K obtained from M vs. H\nmeasurements and Equation 2.

One can conclude that all three curves reproduce the qualitative\nbehavior for the temperature dependence of the magnetic entropy change\nand only differ slightly in the absolute value for the \u2206SM . It is interesting\nto note that a single M vs. T measurement at constant magnetic field gives\nan acceptable estimate of the magnetic entropy change for a second-order\nmagnetocaloric material.\nFrom the magnetic entropy change and the specific heat as function of\ntemperature and magnetic field one can derive an estimate for the adiabatic\ntemperature change. The magnetocaloric effect in terms of the change in\ntemperature \u2206T under a 1 T field change for the synthetic melanostibite\nsample can be estimated to\n\u2206T = \u2212\u2206SM\n\nT\n\u2248 0.2 (K),\nCP (264K, 1T)\n\n(3)\n\nwhere CP (264K, 1T) = 231 J/molK is the specific heat measured at 264 K\nin 1 T applied field.

It was found that the natural mineral Mn2 FeSbO6 undergoes a secondorder magnetic phase transition at 268 K. The synthetic Mn2 FeSbO6 orders\nat 264 K. Both samples order ferrimagneticly and show comparable values for\nthe magnetic entropy change \u2206SM on the order of 2 J/kgK for 5 T and 0.5\nJ/kgK for 1 T field change, respectively. The adiabatic temperature change\nfor the synthetic Mn2 FeSbO6 near room-temperature under 1 T field change\nwas estimate to \u2206T = 0.2 K. We believe that new functional magnetic materials with enhanced magnetocaloric properties based on Mn2 FeSbO6 and\nits substitutions could be designed.\n5.
