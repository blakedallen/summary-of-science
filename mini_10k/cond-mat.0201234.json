The predicted RF (H)\ndependence describes well our experimental data on 7\u25e6 unirradiated and irradiated Y Ba2 Cu3 O7\nbicrystals, from which the core size l(T ), and the intrinsic depairing density Jb (T ) on nanoscales\nof few GB dislocations were measured for the first time. The observed temperature dependence\nof Jb (T ) = Jb0 (1 \u2212 T /Tc )2 indicates a significant order parameter suppression in current channels\nbetween GB dislocation cores.\nPACS numbers: PACS numbers: 74.20.De, 74.20.Hi, 74.60.-w\n\nMechanisms of current transport through grain boundaries (GB) in high-temperature superconductors (HTS)\nhave attracted much attention, because a GB is a convenient tool to probe the pairing symmetry of HTS by\nvarying the misorientation angle \u03b8 between the neighboring crystallites [1, 2]. As \u03b8 increases, the spacing between\nthe GB dislocations decreases, becoming comparable to\nthe coherence length \u03be(T ) at the angle \u03b80 \u2243 4 \u2212 6\u25e6 . The\nexponential decrease of the GB critical current density\nJb = J0 exp(\u2212\u03b8/\u03b80 ) [2], makes GBs one of the principal factors limiting critical currents of HTS [3]. Atomic\nstructure of GBs revealed by high-resolution electron microscopy have been used to determine local underdoped\nstates of GB, defect-induced suppression of superconducting properties at the nanoscale and controlled increase of Jb by overdoping of GB[2, 4]. Much progress\nhas been made in understanding the microscopic factors\ncontrolling Jb (\u03b8) at zero magnetic field, but the behavior\nof vortices on GBs is known to much lesser extent.\nThe extreme sensitivity of Jb (\u03b8) to the misorientation\nangle makes GB a unique tool to trace the fundamental transition between Abrikosov (A) and Josephson (J)\nvortices[5] in a magnetic field H above the lower critical\nfield Hc1 . For \u03b8 \u226a \u03b80 , vortices on a GB are A vortices\nwith normal cores pinned by GB dislocations [6]. For\n\u03b8 > \u03b80 , the maximum vortex current density circulating across the GB is limited to its intrinsic Jb (\u03b8), much\nsmaller then the bulk depairing current density Jd . Because vortex currents must cross the GB which can only\nsustain Jb \u226a Jd , the normal core of an A vortex turns\ninto a J core, whose length l \u2243 \u03beJd /Jb along the GB is\ngreater then \u03be, but smaller then the London penetration\n\ndepth \u03bb, if Jb > Jd /\u03ba, where \u03ba = \u03bb/\u03be \u2243 102 [5]. As \u03b8\nincreases, the core length l(\u03b8) \u2243 \u03beJd /Jb (\u03b8) increases, so\nthe GB vortices evolve from A vortices for \u03b8 \u226a \u03b80 to\nmixed Abrikosov vortices with Josephson cores (AJ vortices) at Jd /\u03ba < Jb (\u03b8) < Jd . The AJ vortices turn into\nJ vortices at higher angles, \u03b8 > \u03b8J \u2243 \u03b80 ln(\u03baJ0 /Jd ), for\nwhich l(\u03b8) exceeds \u03bb. For \u03b80 = 5\u25e6 , \u03ba = 100, and J0 = Jd ,\nthe AJ vortices determine the in-field behavior of GBs in\nthe crucial region 0 < \u03b8 < \u03b8J \u2243 23\u25e6 of the exponential\ndrop of Jb (\u03b8) (in a film of thickness d \u226a \u03bb, the AJ region\n\u03b8 < \u03b8J \u2243 \u03b80 ln(\u03bb2 /d\u03be) broadens even further).\nThe AJ structures have two length scales: the core size\nl > \u03be and the intervortex spacing a = (\u03c60 /B)1/2 . The\nlarger core of AJ vortices leads to their weaker pinning\nalong a GB, which thus becomes a channel for motion\nof AJ vortices between pinned A vortices in the grains\n[5, 7] (Fig. 1). The percolative motion of AJ vortices\nalong GBs gives rise to a linear region in the V \u2212 I\ncharacteristic of HTS polycrystals[6, 8, 9, 10, 11]. However no present experimental techniques can probe the\ncores of GB vortices, because the lack of the normal core\nmakes AJ vortices \"invisible\" under STM, while neither\nthe Lorentz microscopy nor magneto-optics have sufficient spatial resolution to distinguish A and AJ vortices.\nIn this Letter we report a combined theoretical and experimental analysis which enabled us to prove the existence of AJ vortices in 7\u25e6 Y Ba2 Cu3 O7 bicrystals and\nextract the core size l(T ), and the intrinsic depairing current density Jb at the GB from transport measurements.\nThe value Jb of a GB turns out to be much higher than\nits global critical current density Jgb , which is limited\nby self-field and pinning effects [7, 10, 11, 12, 13]. The\n\n\f2\n\nFIG. 1: Current streamlines around AJ vortices on a GB\n(dashed line) and the bulk A vortices in the grains, calculated\nfrom Eq. (5) for l = 0.2a.\n\nfield region in which only a single AJ vortex chain moves\nalong GB while the bulk A vortices remain pinned, can\nbe considerably expanded by irradiation, as shown below.\nFor H \u226b Hc1 , both l = \u03beJd /Jb , and a = (\u03c60 /B)1/2\nare smaller than \u03bb, thus the AJ vortices on low-angle\nGBs are described by a nonlocal equation for the phase\ndifference \u03b8(x, t) in the overdamped limit [5, 7]:\nZ\nl \u221e \u03b8\u2032 (u)du\n\u2212 sin \u03b8 + \u03b2,\n(1)\n\u03c4 \u03b8\u0307 =\n\u03c0 \u2212\u221e u \u2212 x\nl = c\u03c60 /16\u03c0 2 \u03bb2 Jb ,\n\n\u03c4 = \u03c60 /2\u03c0cRJb , (2)\n\nwhere the overdot and the prime denote differentiation\nwith respect to the time t and the coordinate x along GB,\nR is the quasiparticle resistance of GB per unit area, \u03c60\nis the flux quantum, c is the speed of light, \u03b2 = J/Jb ,\nand J(x) is the current density through GB induced by\nA vortices. Here \u03b2 = \u03b20 + \u03b4\u03b2(x) is a sum of the constant\ntransport current \u03b20 and an oscillating component \u03b4\u03b2(x)\ndue to the discreteness of the A vortex lattice. The term\n\u03b4\u03b2(x) gives rise to a critical current Jgb of the GB due\nto pinning of AJ vortices by A vortices in the grains [7,\n14]. Eqs. (1) and (2) are independent of the pairing\nsymmetry (which only affects Jb ) and are valid for both\nbulk samples and thin films in a perpendicular field.\nWe consider a rapidly moving AJ structure in the flux\nflow state, \u03b2 \u226b \u03b2c , for which the pinning term \u03b4\u03b2(x) \u226a\n1 can be neglected[14]. In this case Eq. (1) has the\nfollowing exact solution that describes a stable periodic\nvortex structure moving with a constant velocity v:\n\u03b8 = \u03c0 + \u03b3 + 2 tan\u22121 [M tan k(x \u2212 vt)/2],\nq\ns2 = [ (1 \u2212 \u03b202 + h)2 + 4\u03b202 h \u2212 1 \u2212 h + \u03b202 ]/2h\n\n(3)\n(4)\n\nHere s = v/v0 , v0 = l/\u03c4 , tan \u03b3 = \u2212s, h = (kl)2 ,\n\nFIG. 2: The V \u2212J curves calculated from Eq.

Inset shows the field dependence of RF (H).\n\nM = [1 + 1/h(1 + s2 )]1/2 + [h(1 + s2 )]\u22121/2 , k = 2\u03c0/a, and\na is the period of the AJ structure. For a/l \u2192 \u221e, Eq. (3)\ndescribes a moving chain of single AJ vortices [5]. Generally, a(H) is different from the period of the A lattice,\nbut for H \u226b Hc1 , the spacing a = (\u03c60 /H)1/2 is fixed by\nthe flux quantization condition. Eq. (3) corresponds to\nthe following field distribution H(x, y) produced by AJ\nvortices in the region |y| < \u03bb:\n\nk\n\u03c60\nRe ln sin[x \u2212 vt + i(|y| + y0 )] ,\n(5)\n2\u03c0\u03bb2\n2\np\nh(1 + s2 ). Eq.

(3). Fig. 1 shows the current\nstreamlines calculated from Eq. (5). For y > 0, these\nstreamlines coincide with those of a chain of moving fictitious A vortices displaced by y = \u2212y0 away from GB.\nThe mean voltage V on a GB is determined by the\nFaraday law, V = \u03c60 v/ca, which yields\nhq\ni1/2\nV = V0\n, (6)\n(1 \u2212 \u03b202 + h)2 + 4\u03b202 h \u2212 1 \u2212 h + \u03b202\n\u221a\nwhere V0 = RJb / 2. The V \u2212 J curve shown in Fig. 2\nis similar to that obtained by molecular dynamic simulations of incommensurate vortex channels [15]. In our\ncase the nonlinearity of V (J) is due to the AJ core expansion as J increases[5]. For J \u226a\np Jb , the V-J curve is\nlinear, V = RF J, where RF = R h/(1 + h) is the flux\nflow resistivity due to the viscous motion of AJ vortices.\nIf H \u226b Hc1 , then h = (2\u03c0l/a)2 = H/H0 , and\n\u221a\n\u03c60\nR H\n\u221a\n,\nH0 =\n(7)\nRF =\n(2\u03c0l)2\nH + H0\nH=\n\n\f3\n\nFIG. 3: RF (H) data points extracted from the slopes of\nthe V (J) curves at 77K and different H for unirradiated 7\u25e6\nbicrystal. The solid curves are described by Eq. (7) with\nR = 4.05m\u03a9 and H0 = 0.14T . Inset shows V \u2212 J curves for\n0.17kOe, 0.51kOe, 0.85kOe, 1.7kOe, and 3.4kOe (from bottom to top, respectively).\n\nAt H \u226a H0 , Eq. (7) describes RF (H) for AJ vortices, whose cores do not overlap. In this case RF (H) is\nreminiscent\nof the 1D Bardeen-Stephen formula, RBS \u2243\np\nR H/Hc2 , except that in Eq. (7) the core structure is taken into account exactly. For H > H0 \u2243\n(Jb /Jd )2 Hc2 \u226a Hc2 , the AJ cores overlap, and Eq. (7)\ndescribes a crossover to a field-independent quasiparticle resistance of GB. This regime has no analogs for A\nvortices, whose normal cores overlap only at Hc2 . The\nsimplicity of Eq. (7) enabled us to extract intrinsic GB\nproperties from the measurements of RF (H).\nWe observed the AJ vortex behavior on 7\u25e6\nY Ba2 Cu3 O7 , bicrystals with a sharp resistive transition\n\u2206T < 0.4K at Tc = 91K. Thin films of thickness 250\nnm were grown on [001]-oriented SrT iO3 bicrystals by\npulsed laser deposition at 210 mTorr oxygen pressure\nand 810\u25e6 C, and then annealed in oxygen at 830 Torr and\n520\u25e6 C for 30 min. One 7\u25e6 bicrystal was irradiated with\n1GeV Pb ions at a fluence corresponding to 1T. Bridges\n25 \u03bcm wide were patterned by Ar ion beam etching on\na cooled sample mount to produce a four-point measurement geometry, as described in Ref. [9]. The voltage\nprobes were 100\u03bcm apart, on either sides of the GB.\nV \u2212 I curves were measured in a gas-flow cryostat in\nfields 0 < H < 10 T. Both samples are in the transition\nregion of \u03b8 between strongly coupled bicrystals that behave in a manner similar to the single-crystal grains, and\nweakly coupled bicrystals that demonstrate the Josephson effect[13]. The intragrain Jc values at 77 K were\n0.1M A/cm2 and 0.27M A/cm2 for the unirradiated and\nirradiated samples, respectively.\n\nFIG. 4: RF (H) extracted from the slopes of V (J) for different T and H for the irradiated 7\u25e6 bicrystal. The V \u2212 J\ncurves have the extended linear regions similar to those for\nthe unirradiated sample shown in Fig. 3. The solid curves\nare described by Eq. (7) with two fit parameters R and H0 .\n\nFig. 3 shows V-I characteristics for the unirradiated\nsample at 77K and different magnetic fields. The V-I\ncurves exhibit linear flux flow portions in a wide range\nof I above the depinning critical current Igb (H) which\ndecreases with H [13]. In this work we focus on the\nflux flow region I \u226b Igb , where\u221athe dynamic resistance\nRF (H) = dV /dI increases as H at low H, but levels off at higher H. We found that Eq. (7) describes\nthe observed RF (H) very well, thus the vortex cores\non this GB overlap at H \u223c H0 , well below Hc2 . Because the GB can sustain a finite supercurrent Igb even\nfor H > H0 , the GB vortices lack normal cores. The\ngood fit in Fig. 3 enabled us to extract R = 4.05m\u03a9\nand H0 = 0.14T \u226a Hc2 by plotting 1/RF2 (H) versus\n1/H, as shown in Fig. 2. Using Eq. (7), we obtain\nthat l = (\u03c60 /H0 )1/2 /2\u03c0 = 190\u00c5 at 77K, thus vortices\non this 7\u25e6 GB are indeed AJ vortices\nwith phase cores\np\nmuch greater than \u03be(T\n)\n=\n\u03be\n/\n1\n\u2212\nT\n/Tc \u2243 40\u00c5 but\n0\np\nsmaller than \u03bb = \u03bb0 / 1 \u2212 T /Tc \u2243 4000\u00c5 for \u03be0 \u2243 15\u00c5,\n\u03bb0 \u2243 1500\u00c5, and Tc = 91K.\n\nRF (H) data for the irradiated bicrystal at different T\nare shown in Fig. 4. The good agreement between Eq.\n(7) and the observed RF (H) enabled us to extract the\ntemperature dependences of H0 and R shown in Fig. 5.\nWhile R(T ) varies only weakly, the field H0 (T ) exhibits\na parabolic dependence, H0 (T ) = H0 (0)(1 \u2212 T /Tc)2 with\nH0 (0) \u2248 42T. As follows from Eq. (7), the fact that\nH0 (T ) \u221d (Tc \u2212 T )2 implies l(T ) \u221d (Tc \u2212 T )\u22121 , which, in\nturn, indicates the SNS behavior of Jb (T ) \u221d (Tc \u2212 T )2 ,\nif \u03bb(T ) \u221d (Tc \u2212 T )\u22121/2 in Eq. (2). From the data in\nFig. 5, we can also obtain the absolute value of the\nintrinsic depairing current density Jb averaged over the\n\n\f4\n\nFIG. 5: R(T ) and H0 (T ) extracted from the fit procedure\nrepresented in Fig. 4. The dashed line shows H0 = 42(1 \u2212\nT /Tc )2 [T esla].\n\nJosephson core length p\nl. To do so, we write Eq. (7) in\nthe form Jb = (3Jd /4) 6\u03c0H0 /Hc2 , which express Jb in\nterms of the measured\nH0 , Hc2 = \u03c60 /2\u03c0\u03be 2 ,\n\u221a 2 parameters\n2\n\u2032\nand Jd = c\u03c60 /12 3\u03c0 \u03bb \u03be. For Hc2 (T ) = Hc2\n(Tc \u2212 T ),\n\u2032 1/2\nthis yields Jb \u2243 (3Jd /4)[6\u03c0H0 (0)/Tc Hc2 ] (1\u2212T /Tc)1/2 ,\nwhence Jb (85K) \u2243 0.3Jd (85K) for H0 (0) = 42T , and\n\u2032\nHc2\n= 2T /K. Likewise we get Jb (77K) \u2243 0.23Jd(77K)\nfor the unirradiated sample, (H0 (77K) = 0.14T ). Therefore, our data indicate a significant suppression of the\norder parameter, even on the low-angle 7\u25e6 GB, in agreement with the model of Ref. [16].\nFor the observed H0 (T ), the AJ core length l(T ) =\n\u22121\n(\u03c60 /H0 (T ))1/2 /2\u03c0 \u2243 11(1\u2212T /T\npc) [\u00c5], exceeds the bulk\ncoherence length \u03be(T ) = \u03be0 / 1 \u2212 T /Tc at Tc \u2212 T \u226a\nTc , but remains smaller than \u03bb(T ), except very close\nto Tc . For instance, we obtain l(80K) \u2243 91\u00c5, while\n\u03be(80K) \u2243 43\u00c5, and \u03bb(80K) = 4300\u00c5. The length l(T )\nalso exceeds the GB dislocation spacing \u2248 32\u00c5, thus the\nmoving AJ cores probe GB properties averaged over few\ncurrent channels between dislocations. The core length\nl(\u03b8) \u2243 \u03beJd /Jb (\u03b8) increases as \u03b8 increases, becoming\nlarger than \u03bb, if \u03b8 > \u03b80 ln \u03ba, in which case AJ vortices\nturn into J vortices. Since the ratio Jb /Jd decreases as\nT increases, higher-angle GBs can exhibit AJ vortices at\nlow T and J vortices at T \u2248 Tc , while lower angle GBs\nhave A vortices at low T and AJ vortices at T \u2248 Tc .\nThe depinning current density Jgb seen in Fig. 3 is\ndue to interactions of AJ vortices with microstructural\ninhomogeneities along GB and pinned A vortices in the\ngrains[5]. Another essential mechanism occurs if the periods of AJ and A vortices do not coincide, resulting in\nmisfit dislocations in the AJ chain[15]. These vortex dislocations can strongly limit Jgb because their intrinsic\npinning by the A vortex lattice is exponentially weak[15].\nFor H \u226b Hc1 , when the AJ and A periods are close, the\npinning of a few misfit dislocations in the AJ chain may\nbe thus dominated by macroscopic Tc and Jb (x) varia-\n\ntions along GB caused by facet structures, strain fields,\nlocal nonstoichiometry, etc. [17]. In this Letter we focus\non the flux flow state J \u226b Jgb , where pinning weakly\naffects RF . In this case measurements of RF (H) reveal\nthe essential physics of GB vortices whose moving AJ\ncores probe intrinsic properties of GBs at the nanoscale,\nregardless of particular pinning mechanisms which are essential at J \u2248 Jgb . Because the observed V \u2212J curves are\nnearly linear above Jgb (77K, 1T ) \u223c 104 \u2212 105 A/cm2 \u226a\nJb \u2243 (0.2 \u2212 0.3)Jd \u223c 1 \u2212 10M A/cm2, the pinning region\nJ \u223c Jgb is much smaller than the scale of Fig. 2. Thus,\nthe nonlinearitry of V (J) due to the AJ core expansion\ndoes not affect RF measured at J < 3Jgb so Eq. (7) can\nbe used to fit the data. A similar approach was used\nto measure the flux flow resistivity of pinned A vortices\ndriven by strong current pulses well above Jc [18].\nThe case when only a single AJ vortex row moves along\nthe GB, while the intragrain A vortices remain pinned\ncorresponds to low fields, H < H1 . For H > H1 , the\nAJ vortices drag neighboring A vortices in the flux flow\nchannel along GB [7]. The field H1 can be estimated from\nthe condition that the pinning force f = \u03c60 \u2206H/2a(H)\nof AJ vortices due to their magnetic interaction with\nA vortices equals the bulk pinning force \u03c60 Jc /c, where\n\u2206H = \u03c60 e\u22122\u03c0u/a /\u03c0\u03bb2 is the amplitude of the oscillating\npart of the local field H(x) \u2248 B + \u2206H cos(2\u03c0x/a) produced by A vortices along GB, and u is the spacing of\nthe first A vortex row from GB[14]. Therefore,\n\nH1 \u2243 4\u03c60 Jc2 (H1 )/c2 \u2206H 2\n\n(8)\n\nTransitions from a single to a multiple row vortex motion [9, 11] result in a sharp upturn of the RF (B, 77K)\ncurve at H1 \u2243 4T in Fig. 4. Here H1 for our unirradiated sample (Jc = 0.1M A/cm2 ) is 7.3 times smaller\nthan H1 for the irradiated one (Jc = 0.27M A/cm2).\nFor \u03bb(77K) \u2243 4000\u00c5, and H1 = 4T , Eq. (8) yields\nu = ln(c2 H1 \u03c60 /4\u03c0 2 \u03bb4 Jc2 )/4\u03c0 = 0.92a.\nIn conclusion, vortices on low-angle grain boundaries\nin HTS are mixed Abrikosov-Josephson vortices. Exact\nsolutions for a moving AJ vortex structure, the nonlinear\nV \u2212 J characteristic and the flux flow resistivity RF (B)\nwere obtained. From the measurements of RF (B) on a 7\u25e6\nYBCO bicrystal, we extracted the length of the AJ core\nand the intrinsic depairing current density Jb on GB. The\nanalysis proposed in this work can be used for systematic\nstudies of the effect of overdoping [4] on the local suppression of the order parameter and current transport\nthrough nanoscale channels between GB dislocations.\nThis work was supported by the NSF MRSEC (DMR\n9214707), AFOSR MURI (F49620-01-1-0464), and by\nItalian INFM-PRA JT3D.\n\n\f5\n\n[1] C.C.
