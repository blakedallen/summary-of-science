For efficient coupling, this lateral size should be\nsmall while the number of the junctions should be very large.\nTheoretical possibility of terahertz emission from intrinsic\nJosephson junctions has been investigated more than a decade\n[6-17]. First, Josephson-vortex flow was proposed as the\noperation principle of experimentally observed emission in the\npresence of the applied magnetic field [18]. However, the\nemission of electromagnetic wave without applied magnetic\nfield is also observed in the GHz region [19].\nIt is well known that there exist various dynamic states for the\nsystem in the radiation mode. The power of the emitted\nelectromagnetic radiation in the coherent emission or superradiation regime is known to be proportional to N2, N being\nthe number of junctions.\n\nintrinsic\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nESPITE of being an extremely attractive band, the\n\"terahertz gap\" which is assumed from 0.5 to 10THz is\nhardly applicable because of the lack of practical sources in\nthis range [1]. However, the stack of intrinsic Josephson\njunctions in the mesa structure of layered high-Tc\nsuperconductors is a promising candidate that could fill this\ngap [2]. In such structures, synchronization of high-frequency\noscillations in all Josephson junctions can produce terahertz\nradiation [3].\nA very promising practical way of applying this\nsynchronization in finite-size mesas is the excitation of\ninternal cavity resonance that can be followed by a large\nnumber of junctions through a chain reaction [4,5].

Current-voltage characteristic is another interested\ntopic in this area. For instance, charging effects of CuO layers\non the current-voltage characteristics of the stacked junctions\nare considered previously [28,29]. A method is also proposed\nfor the synchronization of all junctions for the whole region of\nI-V characteristics in addition to the resonance regions [30]. A\nwide range of different effects has been investigated in these\nworks. However, many issues have not yet been revealed\nconcerning the mechanisms and characterizations of the\nterahertz emission. For instance, the optimum radiation power\nwith respect to the involving parameters such as magnitude of\nthe applied magnetic field, sample width, and electrical bias is\nnot fully concerned.\nThe experimental works show that the observed radiated\npower is very low in the order of 100W/cm2 by Kadowaki\n[31] et al. and 20W/cm2 by Bae et al.[19]. Thus, the\noptimization of this power would be of high interest in order\nto achieve the maximum power efficiency. In this case, the\ndependency of the terahertz intensity with respect to some of\nthe size parameters are investigated previously [32].\nConsidering these parameters such as bias current and cavitywaveguide boundary size along with consideration of other\nparameters such as number of layers in the mesa structure and\nthe magnitude of the applied magnetic field, here we\ninvestigate the optimization of the emitted power. The case of\nnon-magnetically biased is also considered in this works. We\nuse the Koshelev model [18] to compute the radiation\nmodulated voltage response of the stack of intrinsic Josephson\njunctions in the single crystal of the high-Tc superconductor\nBSCCO. The proposed model is expressed as a system of N\ncoupled differential sine-Gordon equations. The problem is\nsolved with the dynamic boundary conditions of the radiated\nelectromagnetic wave.\nII. THEORETICAL MODEL\nWe start from the definition of gauge-invariant phase\ndifference as [4-6]\n2\u03c0 zl +1\n(1)\n\u03c8 l +1,l ( r , t ) = \u03c6 l +1 ( r , t ) \u2212 \u03c6 l ( r , t ) \u2212\nAz ( r , t ) dz ,\n\u03a6 0 \uf0f2 zl\nwith the phase of order parameter in the l-th superconducting\nlayer being \u03c6l, where Az stands for the vector potential, the\nquantum flux is expressed by \u03a60, and zl is the height of the lth superconducting layer. In this paper, the subscript \"l+1,l\"\ndenotes quantities in the insulating layer between the l-th and\n(l+1)th superconducting planes. We assumed that the\nthicknesses of the superconducting and insulating layers are s\nand d respectively.\nElectromagnetic dynamics of gauge-invariant phase\ndifference in the presence of applied magnetic field is\ndescribed as a set of coupled sine-Gordon equations that\n\n2\n\ncorrespond to the total pair and quasi-particle tunneling.\nAccording to the Josephson relation, the total current density\nthat passes through each junction along the z-axis can be\nobtained from\n\u03b5 \u2202\n(2)\nJ l , l + 1 = J c sin \u03c6 l + 1, l + \u03c3 c E l + 1, l +\nE l + 1, l ,\n4\u03c0 \u2202 t\nwhere Jc is the Josephson critical current density, \u03c3c is the\nnormal conductivity along the c-axis, and El+1,l is the z-axis\ncomponent of the electric filed between (l+1)th and l-th layers.\nThe c-axis conductivity, \u03c3c, is temperature dependent, and the\ndamping term can be neglected in small values of \u03c3c. In the\nabove equation, the first, second, and third terms represent the\npair tunneling, quasi-particle tunneling, and the charge\naccumulation currents respectively. Using the London theory\nas well as the Maxwell equations, the properties of the system\ncan be expressed as [27]\n\u2202 2\u03c6 l +1,l\n\uf0e6 \u2202\u03be\n\uf0f6\n= (1 \u2212 \u03b6 \u0394 n2 ) \uf0e7 l +1,l + \u03b2\u03be l +1,l + sin \u03c6 l +1,l \u2212 j \uf0f7\n2\n\u2202\u03c7\n(3)\n\uf0e8 \u2202\u03c4\n\uf0f8\n\u2202 \u03c6 l +1,l\n\n= (1 \u2212 \u03b1 \u0394 n2 ) \u03be l +1,l ,\n\u2202\u03c4\nin which the finite difference operator is defined as \u0394n2fn =\nfn+1+fn-1-2fn, and the parameters \u03b1=\u03b5c\u03bc2/sd and \u03b6=\u03bbab/sd are\ncapacitive and inductive couplings between different junctions\nand \u03b2=4\u03c0\u03c3c\u03bbc/\u03b5c1/2 is the damping term. In the definition of\nthese parameters, \u03bbc and \u03bbab are London penetration depth\nalong the c-axis and CuO planes respectively, \u03b5c and \u03bc are the\nrelative permittivity and susceptibility inside the cavity\nrespectively, and \u03c3c is the quasiparticle conductivity across the\nc-axis. We have replaced the quantities \u03c8l+1,l, El+1,l, x, and t by\ntheir equivalents \u03c6l+1,l, \u03bel+1,l, \u03c7, and \u03c4 in an scaled unit which is\ndefined by following transformations,\n\u03c3\nx\nJ\n(4)\n\u03c7 = ,\u03c4 = \u03c9 p t , j =\n, \u03be l +1,l = c E l +1,l ,\n\u03bbc\n\u03b2 Jc\nJc\nwhere Jc and \u03c9p are the critical current and plasma frequency\nof the intrinsic junctions that can be replaced by c\u03a60/8\u03c02\u03bbc2d\nand c/\u03b5c1/2\u03bbc respectively. In such a reduced unit, the scaled\nmagnetic field, bl+1,l, is also obtained from\n\u2202 \u03c6 l +1,l\n(5)\n= (1 \u2212 \u03b6 \u0394 2n ) bl +1,l ,\n\u2202\u03c7\nwhile it is related to the magnetic field through\nbl+1,l=2\u03c0\u03bbcdBl+1,l /\u03a60. The dynamical boundary condition [8]\nbetween the oscillatory parts of scaled boundary fields is\napplied on the edges with the assumption of infinite number of\njunctions, following Lin et al. [24] leading to\n\u2202 \u03c6 l +1,l\n= bl +1,l \u03c4 + b\uf025l +1,l\n\u2202\u03c7\n\u2202 \u03c6 l +1,l\n(6)\n= j \u03b2 + \u03be\uf025l +1,l\n\u2202\u03c4\nb\uf025l +1,l = \u00b1 z \u03b5 c \u03b5 d \u03be\uf025l +1,l ,\n\nwhere z models the impedance mismatch between the cavity\nand the dielectric, \u03b5d, is the relative permittivity of the\ndielectric, the symbol <...>\u03c4 stands for time averaging, and the\nsymbol  \u0303 over field quantities represents their oscillatory parts.\n\n\f> REPLACE THIS LINE WITH YOUR PAPER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (DOUBLE-CLICK HERE TO EDIT) <\nThe final equation approximates the boundary condition\nproposed in ref. [18] in the special case of infinite number of\nthe junctions where the nonuniformity of oscillations can be\nneglected.

RESULTS AND ANALYSES\nEquation (3) is solved for N = 20 to 60 superconducting\nlayers. The values of \u03bbc=200\u03bcm, \u03c9p=4.7\u00d71011rad/s, s=3\u00c5,\nd=12\u00c5, \u03b1=0.1, \u03b2=0.02, \u03b6=5\u00d7105, and \u03b5c=10 are chosen for the\nparameters, which are very similar to the ones of BSCCO\nsuperconductor. However, our simulations show negligible\ndependency of results to capacitive and inductive coupling\nparameters in almost wide range of variations. Thus, similar\nanalysis is applicable to the other types of layered\nsuperconductors. In the numerical simulations, the relative\ntolerance of the results between successive time steps is set to\nbe lower than 10-7. The mesh size of 0.001 in the reduced unit\nof length is selected. The radiation intensity is calculated for\nthe obtained results by the method similar to the previous\nworks [19]:\n2\n\u03b5 c\n(7)\nS i = d ( E\uf025 l + 1, l )\n2\n\nb)\n\nFig. 4.

It is also expected that by increasing cavity size, this\nstationary condition moves toward solitonic regime. Fig. 3.b\nshows the electric field distribution for the case of Lx=200\u03bcm\nwhich is almost an intermediate situation between solitonic\nand standing wave regimes.

Power Spectrum Characterization\nIn this section, the variation and optimization of the\nradiated power at different design parameters is discussed. We\nassumed a square form sample with the magnetic field in\ndirection of a-axis while the effects of finite size in the b-axis\nare neglected.\nIn Fig. 5, the power spectrums of the emitted\n\nIn Fig. 6, the power spectrums of emitted wave for different\napplied bias currents are depicted. The figure shows that\nincreasing the bias current shifts the center frequency to\nhigher values. This might be associated to the increase of\nLorentz force applied to the Josephson vortices from the caxis current that make them move faster. The faster move\nJosephson vortices, the rapider change the magnetic field and\n\n\f> REPLACE THIS LINE WITH YOUR PAPER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (DOUBLE-CLICK HERE TO EDIT) <\nhence the frequency increases. The figure also shows that the\nfrequency of the peak intensity in the power radiation\nspectrum almost linearly depends on the applied dc current. In\naddition, excluding the case of J/Jc=0.2, the peak power\nshows ascending behaviors in the both domains of the\nelectrical bias and the frequency. However, when J/Jc=0.2 is\napplied, its associated peak is slightly lower than other ones\nwhile an extra peak is also observed at about 1.5THz in the\nspectrum. It seems that in this special case, two harmonics are\nexcited and the second one absorbed a fraction of the radiation\npower. It might be associated to the interference between\ntraveling adjacent Josephson vortices at this special current.\nThe behavior is similar to the one of an assumptive case in\nwhich semi-vortices move between the two neighboring\nJosephson vortices and swing the magnetic field with a\nduplicated frequency at a lower power.\nThe dependency of the power spectrum to the cavity width\nis presented in Fig. 7. As it is concluded from the figure,\nthough that widening the cavity would not change the center\nfrequency, it strongly enhances the adjacent harmonics\nespecially in the low frequency side of the central harmonic.\nAs we previously mentioned, low-dimension cavities results\nin the generation of stationary waves and monochromatic\nbehavior, while wide cavities produce solitonic waves with\nlarge nonlinearity and side harmonics. Widening of the\nspectrum with increasing cavity size in Fig. 7 further confirms\nthe above analyses.\nTABLE II\nSIMULTANEOUS ANALYSIS OF RADIATION POWER VERSUS CAVITY WIDTH\nAND CURRENT (B=0.87T)\nLx=20\u03bcm\n\nLx=40\u03bcm\n\nLx=60\u03bcm\n\nLx=80\u03bcm\n\nJ/Jc=0.1\n\n83.4nW\n\n271nW\n\n428nW\n\n30.4nW\n\nJ/Jc=0.2\n\n320nW\n\n440nW\n\n66.2nW\n\n75.1nW\n\nJ/Jc=0.3\n\n554nW\n\n64.0nW\n\n474nW\n\n139nW\n\nJ/Jc=0.4\n\n485nW\n\n276nW\n\n212nW\n\n538nW\n\nC. Radiation Power Optimization\nThree major parameters, which are cavity width, bias\ncurrent, and applied dc magnetic field might affect on the\nradiated power. In order to find the optimized point for the\noutput power, one should obtain the dependency of power to\nthese parameters. In the following, we perform the\noptimization process with respect to each pair of these\nparameters while the full 3D optimization that needs a large\namount of processing is under further investigations.\nIn tables I, II and III, the variations of the emitted power\n\n6\n\nwith respect to each pair of the mentioned parameters are\nshown. In the considered grids, which contain values in the\norder of experimental samples, one could observe a semioscillatory behavior of the electromagnetic power as the\ncavity size, bias current and the dc applied magnetic field\nchange. Maximum power among these grids is obtained with\nLx=20\u03bcm, B=0T, and J/Jc=0.3. On the other hand, simulations\nshow that minimum power is generated by a sample of\nLx=20\u03bcm width, exposed to the dc magnetic field of B=0.93T,\nand biased by the dc current of J/Jc=0.1.\nDue to the heating effect, temperature control, and\nefficiency considerations, it would be of great interest to study\nthe fraction of the radiated power to the power fed into the\nsamples, Q=Prad/Pin, for these simulation results. While Pin is\nproportional to J 2Lx2, by looking into the tables I to III, one\ncan find that the maximum and minimum radiation power\nefficiencies are obtained by the parameters (J/Jc=0.3, B=0T,\nLx=20\u03bcm) and (J/Jc=0.1, B=0.87T, Lx=80\u03bcm) to be 3% and\n0.006% respectively. Thus, applying the magnetic field of\nB=0.8T and the c-axis current of J/Jc=0.1 to a sample of width\nLx=20\u03bcm leads to the maximum radiation power along with\nthe maximum electrical power efficiency, simultaneously.\nSimilar to these numerical results for the radiation power\ncan be found in the previously published experimental data.\nAs reported by Ozyuzer et. al., 20\u03bcW of pumping power is\nobserved for 500 junctions [4]. Assuming that the number of\njunctions quadratically controls the power, this result is\ncomparable with our data obtained for 60 junctions, regardless\nof temperature effects. More recently, 20\u03bcW at the radiation\npeak is observed for a rectangular mesa sample of 1\u03bcm\nthickness. Such a thickness contains about 700 junctions\nwhich is about 40% more than the previous one [36]. Scaling\nthis power by quadratic relation corresponds to 150nW for 60\njunctions. Since the sample is rectangular (300\u03bcm\u00d780\u03bcm) and\nthe exact details of the electrical bias is not mentioned in the\npaper, it cannot directly be compared with the simulation data.\nHowever, the value is close to the result obtained for a square\nmesa of 80\u03bcm\u00d780\u03bcm.\nTABLE III\nSIMULTANEOUS ANALYSIS OF RADIATION POWER VERSUS CAVITY WIDTH\nAND MAGNETIC FIELD (J/JC=0.1)\nBa=0\n\nBa=0.8T\n\nBa=0.87T\n\nBa=0.93T\n\nBa=1T\n\nLx=20\u03bcm\n\n650nW\n\n702nW\n\n335nW\n\n21.0nW\n\n83.7nW\n\nLx=40\u03bcm\n\n332nW\n\n21.8nW\n\n626nW\n\n416nW\n\n271nW\n\nLx=60\u03bcm\n\n784nW\n\n694nW\n\n220nW\n\n184nW\n\n438nW\n\nLx=80\u03bcm\n\n201nW\n\n439nW\n\n30.4nW\n\n275nW\n\n434nW\n\nIn Fig. 8, the dependency of the total radiated power\nintensity to the number of the layers is investigated. The figure\n\n\f> REPLACE THIS LINE WITH YOUR PAPER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (DOUBLE-CLICK HERE TO EDIT) <\nshows that increasing the number of the mesa layers would\nincrease the total power. As mentioned earlier, two regimes of\noperation are proposed for the radiation of the stack of\nJosephson junctions [18]. Synchronization of the junctions\nleads to super-radiation regime, which enhance the radiation\npower by the factor of N2, N being the number of\nsynchronized junctions inside the space of the radiation\nwavelength. However, assuming independent junctions, the\ntotal power would be enhanced by N. In Fig. 8, these two\nextreme cases have been depicted. The simulation results are\nbetween these two extremes and closer to the synchronized\nregime. Since the calculations are performed for the finite\nnumber of junctions, the numerical results do not exactly\ncoincide with the predictions for the synchronized systems. It\nis remarkable that in this figure, the quadratic and linear\ncurves are fitted to the calculation results at the junction\nnumber of 20 in order to allow better comparison between\nthese three plots in the considered range.\n\n[2]\n\n[3]\n[4]\n\n[5]\n\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n\n[10]\n[11]\n\n[12]\n[13]\nFig. 8. Variation of the radiation power by change in the number of\njunctions (Ba=0.87T, Lx=20\u03bcm)\n\nIV. CONCLUSION\nThe terahertz radiation from the stack of intrinsic Josephson\njunctions is characterized in this paper. The power spectrum\nfor different design parameters is obtained and discussed.\nMaximum radiation power and power efficiency are also\ninvestigated with respect to these parameters. The results\nshow a semi-oscillatory behavior of the radiation power with\nrespect to the magnetic field, bias current, and cavity size. In\nour analyses, the maximum radiation power and efficiency\noccur simultaneously in a special value of these parameters.\nMoreover, at some current biases more than one harmonic is\nexcited.\n\n[14]\n\n[15]\n\n[16]\n\n[17]\n\n[18]\n[19]\n\nREFERENCES\n[1]\n\nSee, e.g., A.
