Often one knows only the first few terms; but even if one\nknows many, the raw series is usually useful only for a\nlimited range of values of the expansion parameter. One\nmay therefore turn to various methods for improving the\nconvergence properties. This is justified if one expects\nthat the solution, in the region of interest of the expansion variable, is an analytic continuation of the solution\nin the region in which one is performing the expansion.\nThe best-known method is the Pad\u00e9 approximation [2]\nand its various Hermite-Pad\u00e9 generalizations [3].\nOn the other hand, when extrapolations from one parameter region to another were called for within particle\nphysics, the solution was the Gell-Mann\u2013Low renormalization group (GML-RG) [4, 5]. This method is normally\nnot comparable to the Pad\u00e9 approximation because it\ntakes as input not only the known terms of the expansion, but also certain known nontrivial symmetries in the\nproblem, an approach that was later formalized and extended to the study of differential equations using Lie\ngroup-theoretic methods [6]. We should also mention a\nrelated body of work in Ref. [7].\nWe analyze the mechanism of operations of GML-RG\nin the single-variable (SV) case. We show that the SV\nGML-RG requires no special symmetry and is in fact an\nintegral Hermite-Pad\u00e9 approximation [8], a connection\nthat remains largely unexplored. The method is applicable to any series expansion, but is especially good for\ninterpolation between a power-series expansion (for small\nvalues of a variable) and a scaling law (for large values of\nthe variable), where the scaling law exponent is a known\ncontinuous function of a parameter, and one seeks, e.g.,\nan approximation for the prefactor. As a case in point,\nwe treat the density matrix of the Lieb-Liniger gas [9], an\nobject of considerable interest to both cold gases [10, 11]\nand integrable systems [12] communities.\nThe GML-RG suggests itself very naturally in problems where a physical quantity at one value of a param-\n\neter is given as an expansion in terms of the value of the\nsame quantity at another value of the parameter, a situation usually caused by regularization and renormalization [5]. A simple single-parameter example is T (kb ) =\nT (ka ) + 2\u03bc ln(kb /ka )T 2 (ka ) + (2\u03bc)2 ln2 (kb /ka )T 3 (ka ) +\n* * * , which is the Born series for the scattering problem for the 2D delta-function potential [13]; T (k) is the\ncomplex-valued function one is trying to determine (T matrix), \u03bc > 0 is a constant (mass), and the expansion\nholds for all ka , kb > 0 (momenta). The expansion would\nnot seem to be useful unless kb /ka \u2248 1; however, we may\ntry a \"divide and conquer\" approach: instead of going\nfrom ka to kb in a single large step, we use many smaller\nsteps, ka = k0 \u2192 k1 \u2192 k2 \u2192 * * * \u2192 kN = kb , for each\nof which kj+1 /kj \u2248 1. If kn+1 /kn = 1 + \u01eb, we may let\n\u01eb \u2192 0, N \u2192 \u221e so that (1 + \u01eb)N = const. = kb /ka .\nWe obtain an equation of the form k T \u2032 (k) = \u03b2(T (k)),\nthe Callan-Symanzik equation (CSE) for the problem,\nwhose solution is the RG-improved solution of the problem. In this example, \u03b2(T ) = 2\u03bc T 2 at all Born orders. Thus, starting with the first nontrivial Born order, the RG treatment here produces the exact result,\n1/T (kb ) = 1/T (ka ) \u2212 2\u03bc ln(kb /ka ). Now note that the\nCSE may be obtained by applying \u2202/\u2202kb |kb ,ka \u2192k to\nboth sides of the expansion. Thus, to get the RGimproved solution, we differentiate the original expansion and then promptly integrate it, which raises the\nquestion: why do we not end up right back where we\nstarted? More formally, let T (k) be the quantity of\ninterest; then for some r, \u03c4 = k r T is dimensionless.\nThe exact solution of the problem may be written as\n\u03c4 (kb ) = H(\u03c4 (ka ), ka , kb ) for some function H. Dimensional analysis then says that there must exist a function\nG such that \u03c4 (kb ) = G [\u03c4 (ka ), kb /ka ] (scale invariance or\nself-similarity of \u03c4 ). Applying \u2202/\u2202kb |kb ,ka \u2192k , we get the\nCSE, k \u03c4 \u2032 (k) = \u03b2(\u03c4 (k)), where \u03b2(x) = G(0, 1) (x, 1). This\nR \u03c4 (k ) 1\ndt, and we see\nis easily integrated, kkab = exp \u03c4 (kab) \u03b2(t)\nthat if we start with the exact dependence of \u03c4 (kb ) on\n\n\f2\n\u03c4 (ka ) and kb /ka (i.e. exact G), the RG procedure must\ngive the same exact dependence back. On the other hand,\nif we start with a truncated series expansion of G (a finitedegree polynomial in \u03c4 (ka )), then the RG does not give\nthe same finite-degree polynomial back. But how does\nthe RG \"know\" that the polynomial was not itself the\nexact G? The answer is that not every function of two\nvariables can play the role of exact G, because an exact\nG must satisfy a special group property [4]. Namely, if\nwe wish to relate \u03c4 (kb ) and \u03c4 (ka ), we can do it directly,\n\u03c4 (kb ) = G(\u03c4 (ka ), kb /ka ), or we can go through an intermediary, \u03c4 (ka ) \u2192 \u03c4 (kc ) and then \u03c4 (kc ) \u2192 \u03c4 (kb ). The results will agree only if G satisfies G(x, ab) = G(G(x, a), b)\nfor all a, b, and x. This is a group property, because it\nallows us to introduce a (Lie) group with elements Ga by\ndefining group action on numbers through Ga x = G(x, a).\nGroup multiplication then corresponds to composition,\nGb Ga x = G(G(x, a), b) = G(x, ab) = Gab x. The generator\nd\nGa |a=1 x = \u03b2(x).\ngives the \u03b2-function: Bx = da\nThe analysis that follows is straightforward, though it\nseems that it has not yet been reported in the literature.\nFirst, if G(x, z) is to satisfy the group property, it cannot be a polynomial of finite degree in x, because then\nG(G(x, a), b) would be a polynomial whose order is the\nsquare of that of G(x, ba). Second, for any function of two\nvariables F (x, z) (regardless of whether is satisfies the\ngroup property or not) we may define \u03b2(x) = F (0, 1) (x, 1).\nThe solution of the CSE is a function Fe(x, z) which satisfies the group property, has the same \u03b2-function as\nF (x, z), and is equal to F (x, z) if and only if F (x, z) itself\nsatisfies the group property. Next, suppose F (x, z) is a\ntruncated expansion in x of some true G(x, z), so that it\ndoes not satisfy the group property; the key question is\nwhy \u03c4e(x) = Fe(\u03c40 , x/x0 ) is so frequently a better approximation of \u03c4true (x) = G(\u03c40 , x/x0 ) than \u03c4 (x) = F (\u03c40 , x/x0 )\nis. At first glance, the answer may seem obvious: because \u03c4true (x) is expressed in a self-similar form (through\nG), its approximation should also be represented in a\nself-similar form; \u03c4e(x) is so represented (through Fe ),\nwhile \u03c4 (x) is not. However, this cannot be right, because all functions of single variable are representable in\na self-similar form, at least on intervals where they are\nx2\nx2 \u22121\nmonotonic: f (x2 ) = f ( x1\nx1) = f ( x1\nf (f (x1 ))). (Provably, a function G satisfies the group property if and\nonly if there is a single-variable function f such that\nG(x, z) = f (z f \u22121 (x)).) When this procedure is applied\nto \u03c4 (x) = F (\u03c40 , x/x0 ), we may call it \"an upgrade to a\nself-similar form through an exact inversion of the approximate expression.\" However, instead of exactly inverting the polynomial that is F (\u03c40 , x/x0 ), we may also\nthink of it as a truncation of an infinite series and perform an order-by-order series reversion; then we compose the truncated series and its reversion according to\nf (z f \u22121 (x)). This way, any expansion in a single variable can be represented as a truncated self-similar expansion, which is then treatable by the GML RG (see\n\nbelow for a simpler method). However, the question of\nwhy \u03c4e(x) is \"better\" than \u03c4 (x) remains. To proceed,\nlet G be a function satisfying the group property; let\nz = x2 /x1 so that \u03c4 (x2 ) = G(\u03c4 (x1 ), z) and assume G\nhas an expansion in powers of \u03c41 = \u03c4 (x1 ): G(\u03c41 , z) =\nf1 (z) \u03c41 + f2 (z) \u03c412 + f3 (z) \u03c413 + * * * . Imposing the group\nproperty and equating terms of like orders in \u03c41 , we\nobtain a recursive sequence of functional equations:\nf1 (ba) = f1 (b)f1 (a); f2 (ba) = f12 (b)f2 (a) + f2 (b)f1 (a);\nf3 (ba) = f13 (b)f3 (a) + 2f1 (b)f2 (b)f2 (a) + f3 (b)f1 (a); . . .\nWe get f1 (z) = z r , where r is a real number, and\nf2 (z) = a2 f2,2 , f3 (z) = a22 f3,2 + a3 f3,3 , etc., where\nr\nr\nf2,2 = zr (z r \u2212 1), f3,2 = zr2 (z r \u2212 1)2 , etc. (If r = 0,\nwe have f2,2 = ln z; f3,2 = ln2 z; f3,3 = ln z, etc.) Here\na2 = f2 \u2032 (1), a3 = f3 \u2032 (1), etc., are arbitrary constants. It\nwill be convenient to introduce an expansion in \"rows:\"\n\u03c42\n\n= f1 (z) \u03c41\n=\n\nr\n\nz \u03c41\n\n+\n\nf2 (z) \u03c412 +\n\n+\n\n0\n\n+\n\n+ a2 f2,2 \u03c412 +\n+\n\nf3 (z) \u03c413\n\n+\n\n0\n\n+\n\na22 f3,2 \u03c413 +\n\nf4 (z) \u03c414\n\n+ ***\n\n0\n\n+ ***\n\na32 f4,2 \u03c414 + ***\n\na3 f3,3 \u03c413 + a3 a22 f4,3 \u03c414 + ***\n+ a4 f4,4 \u03c414\n\nfn (z) \u03c41n\n\n+ *** .\n\nNote that\nis the sum of the entries of the nth\ncolumn; the nth order of perturbation theory gives the\nfirst n columns. Suppose we knew the expansion to the\nsecond order. We see that if f2 (z) is nonzero, then a2 is\nnonzero, and so even though we do not know f3 (z), we\ncan nevertheless conclude that it must at least have the\nterm proportional to a22 . In fact the entire second row in\nthe table must be nonzero. (In the 2D scattering example\nabove, all the other rows were zero.) More generally, from\nthe first n columns we can deduce the full first n rows.\nWhat RG does, in effect, is fill out all the rows whose\nentries can be deduced from the known columns, sets the\nother rows to 0, sums the result to infinite order, and\nanalytically continues beyond the radius of convergence\nof the resulting infinite series. To see this, note that the\n\u03b2-function is determined solely by the leading terms of\neach row: \u03b2(\u03c41 ) = r \u03c41 + a2 \u03c412 + a3 \u03c413 + * * * . The solution\nof the CSE with the \u03b2-function truncated to the nth order then is precisely an Fe(\u03c4, z) whose \"row expansion\"\nhas just the first n rows. In short, the RG treatment results in a minimal upgrade to a self-similar form: it only\nincludes the rows we know how to reconstruct from the\nperturbation expansion. In contrast, an upgrade through\nan exact inversion of the approximate expression will in\naddition produce spurious rows, artifacts that have nothing to do with the underlying problem. Note that when\nwe use an ordinary perturbation expansion to compute\nactual numerical values, we set to zero all orders we did\nnot actually compute; in RG we simply follow the same\nrule, though this time we apply it to the rows.\nThere is also a completely different way to think about\nSV GML-RG, which makes it clear that it is a species of\nHermite-Pad\u00e9 approximation. From the representation\nG(x, z) = f [z f \u22121 (x)] it is easy to show that \u03b2{f }(x) =\n\n\f3\n\u22121 \u2032\nf \u22121 (x)/[f\n] (x). Now consider integrals of the form\nR xb\nexp xa 1/g(t) dt. If g(t) = \u03b2{f }(x), the integral is identically equal to f \u22121 (xb )/f \u22121 (xa ), and represents the integrated CSE. We are interested, however, in the situation\nwhen we only know a truncated expansion for f , T {f }.\nBy formal series manipulation, we can compute two objects that are asymptotically (for small x) equal to \u03b2{f }:\n(a) \u03b2{T {f }}, and (b) T {\u03b2{f }}. If g is set\nR x to (a), namely\nto T {f \u22121 }/T {[f \u22121]\u2032 }, the integral exp xab 1/g(t) dt will\nreturn T {f \u22121 }(xb )/T {f \u22121 }(xa ). Setting xa = 0 and performing a series reversion then brings us right back to\nwhere we started, to T {f }, as it must because every step\nwas reversible. However, if g is set to (b), namely to\nT {f \u22121 /[f \u22121 ]\u2032 }, that is an irreversible step, and the result\nis something new: an RG approximant. More formally:\nsuppose f has an expansion (for simplicity about zero)\nc0 x\u03b10 + c1 x\u03b11 + * * * with all cj 6= 0 and Re \u03b10 < Re \u03b11 <\n* * * . Let Tn {f }(x) be the truncation of that expansion\nup to and including the x\u03b1n term. Now formal series\nmanipulations allow one to compute truncated expansions of various transformations of f (such as f 2 , 1/f ,\nf \u2032 , f \u22121 , etc.) order-by-order, up to some maximal order\nthat is still completely determined by Tn {f }(x). Let us\ndenote these derived expansions by, e.g., T[f 2 | Tn {f }](x)\n(for example, T[1/ sin | T2 {sin}](x) = x1 + 61 x). Now we\nintroduce the (order-\u03b1n , centered-at-0) renormalization\ngroup on-the-inverse approximant (RGIA) through\n\nRGIAn {f }(x) =\nlim Tn {f }(\u01eb) exp\n\n\u01eb\u21920\n\nZ\n\n\u01eb\n\nx\n\n1\nT[f /f \u2032 | Tn {f }](s)\n\nds . (1)\n\nThis expression is the key result of the paper. Note that:\n(1) the usual RG result is given by RGIAn {f \u22121 }(x); (2)\nusually T[f /f \u2032 | Tn {f }](s) is a polynomial, in which case\nthe integral can be evaluated analytically (in terms of\nlogarithms and arctangents) once the polynomial is decomposed into partial fractions. This requires factoring\nthe polynomial, in other words, finding its zeros, which\nis normally the only numerical step in the computation.\nReplacing the denominator in Eq. (1) by its Pad\u00e9 approximation tends to improve results further.\nThere is at least one class of functions f for which it\nis obvious that RGIAn {f } must be a better approximant\nfor f than Tn {f }: the functions whose only singularities are poles (of any order) but whose derivatives have\nno zeros. The reason is that for such functions, f /f \u2032 is\nanalytic everywhere. An example is f (x) = tan x, with\nf /f \u2032 = 12 sin 2x. Near the pole at x = \u03c0/2, the Taylor\nexpansion for f fails as an approximation for f . However,\nthe Taylor expansion for f /f \u2032 remains a good approximation for f /f \u2032 , and so RGIAn {f } remains a good approximation for f . Order-by-order, in this case, at least, it\nalso performs better than the Pad\u00e9 approximation. One\nshould emphasize that experience thus far shows that the\nRGIA is useful for a much broader class of functions, de-\n\nspite the fact that there is no clear reason why it should\nbe so; but in the case of Pad\u00e9 approximation, it is also\nstill not completely understood why it performs as well\nas it does, even after more than a century of research [2].\nIt is however clear that RGIA is a special case of\nthe so-called integral Hermite-Pad\u00e9 approximant [8], defined as follows: one finds the polynomials P (x), Q(x),\nand R(x), of orders p, q, and r, that satisfy the condition P (x)f \u2032 (x) + Q(x)f (x) + R(x) = O(xp+q+r+2 ), with\nP (0) = 1; the more terms one has in the expansion of f ,\nthe higher the order of agreement, p + q + r + 2, that one\ncan demand. Then one sets the right hand side to zero;\nthe solution of the resulting equation is the integral approximant. We see that RGIA corresponds to R(x) = 0\nand Q(x) = \u2212f \u2032 (0)/f (0). Thus, the SV GML-RG is\nan integral Hermite-Pad\u00e9 approximation plus a series re\u22121 \u2032\n(0) \u22121\nf (x) = O(xp+2 ).\nversion [14]: P (x)[f \u22121 ]\u2032 (x) \u2212 [ff \u22121](0)\nWe note in passing that while in the Pad\u00e9 approximation community it is believed that best approximants\nshould be invariant under the homographic transformation x = Aw/(1 + Bw) [15], this invariance demands\np = q + 2 (and q = r), so that the RGIA is invariant under this transformation only if p = 2. On the other hand,\nhigh-energy physics community has accumulated a huge\namount of knowledge and experience about GML-RG. In\nthe future we plan to bring the two research traditions together around the point of contact, the RGIA, and begin\nto work out what mutual implications they may have.\nTurning to practical applications of the RGIA, we\nwill consider problems where, in addition to the expansion of f (x) for small values of x, one also knows\nthe exponent of the scaling law for large values of x:\nf (x) \u223c C/x\u03b1 with \u03b1 known but C unknown. The\nidea is to apply the RGIA to fe(x) = x\u03b1 f (x) (one can\ntreat the case where f \u223c C(x0 \u2212 x)\u03b2 at a finite x0 in\na similar way). Problems like this can be approached\nusing Pad\u00e9 approximation as well [15, 16], but for\nexponents which are not simple fractions, the Pad\u00e9\nmethod becomes inconvenient. For example, to treat an\nirrational exponent, one would have to approximate it\nby a ratio of integers p/q, and then find the approximant\nfor [fe(x)]q . This becomes particularly unnatural if the\nexponent is a function of a continuous parameter. In this\ncase RGIA is clearly a better choice, because even for\nirrational exponents \u03b1, \u03b2 = fe/fe\u2032 is a rational function;\nthe RGIA will then itself be a continuous function of\nthe exponent. As a nontrivial application, we consider the one-body\u2013reduced density matrix \u03c11 (z1 ; z1\u2032 ) =\nRL\nRL\n. . . 0 dz2 . . . dzN \u03a8(z1 , z2 , . . . , zN )\u03a8\u2217 (z1\u2032 , z2 , . . . , zN )\n0\nof the ground-state Lieb-Liniger gas (a 1D gas of bosons\ninteracting via interparticle potential g1D \u03b4(z)) with\nperiodic boundary conditions [9, 10, 11, 12].

We also use a new\n\u0001\nresult, c4 (\u03b3) = \u03b3 e\u20324 /12 \u2212 3 e4 /8 + 2 \u03b3 2 + \u03b3 3 e\u20322 /24 \u2212\n\u03b3 e2 /6 \u2212 \u03b3 e2 e\u20322 /4 + 3 e22 /4 , whose derivation will appear\nelsewhere [17]. For nz \u2192 \u221e, from Luttinger liquid\ntheory [18] it is known that g1 (z)/n = C(\u03b3)/ (nz)\u03b1(\u03b3)\nwith 8\u03c0 2 \u03b12 = 6e2 (\u03b3) \u2212 4\u03b3e\u20322 + \u03b3 2 e\u2032\u20322 ; C(\u03b3) is not known,\nand we extract it using GML-RG. In Figure 1, we\ncompare the results of an RGIA interpolation between\nthe short-distance expansion and the long-distance\nscaling law for g1 (z)/n with the results of an ab initio\nquantum diffusion Monte Carlo simulation [11], at a\nwide range of interaction strengths \u03b3. In the table to\nthe right of the plot, we compare the results for the\nprefactor C(\u03b3), finding remarkable agreement. (We\nshould mention here the excellent analytical estimate\nof C(\u03b3) from an inspired, though as-yet unjustified,\nextrapolation of Popov theory in Ref. [19].)\nWe have analyzed the mechanism of operation of\nsingle-variable Gell-Mann\u2013Low renormalization group\n(SV GML-RG). We found that it does not rely on any\nspecial symmetries and that it is in fact is a combination\nof series reversion and an integral Hermite-Pad\u00e9 approximation. To the best of our knowledge, such an explicit\nconnection between the GML-RG and Pad\u00e9 methods had\nnot yet been pointed out, and future work may use this\nconnection to explore the implications that the GML-RG\nand Pad\u00e9 research traditions have for each other. One\n\nobvious direction would be to see if invariance under homographic transformation plays any role in GML-RG.\nFinally, we singled out a class of interpolation problems\nfor which GML-RG is particularly well-suited; we demonstrated the effectiveness of the method in the case of the\ndensity matrix of the Lieb-Liniger gas, for which we have\nalso announced the exact form of the fourth-order term\nin the short-distance expansion.\nWe thank R.
