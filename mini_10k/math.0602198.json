Ya. Viro invented a powerful method to construct real algebraic hypersurfaces with prescribed topology in toric varieties. Since then it has become the main tool to prove\nthe existence of certain topological types among families of real algebraic varieties.\nClassification of the real schemes realized by nonsingular curves of degree 7 in RP 2 ([Vir84]), smoothing of curves with complicated singularities ([Vir89], [Shu99]), maximal curvature of plane algebraic\ncurves ([LdM]), construction of counterexamples to the Ragsdale conjecture ([Ite93], [Ite01], [Haa95],\n[San] and [Bru06]) and construction of projective hypersurfaces with big Betti numbers ([Bih]) are\nexamples of results using Viro method. It has also been used to prove maximality results. A real algebraic variety X is said to be maximal (M -variety) if the sum of the Betti numbers with Z2 coefficients\nof its real part is equal to the corresponding sum for its complexification (b\u2217 (RX; Z2 ) = b\u2217 (CX; Z2 )).\nViro method has been very useful to prove for instance the existence of projective M -hypersurfaces of\nany degree in any dimension ([IV]) or existence of asymptotically maximal families of hypersurfaces\nin any projective toric variety ([Ber06]).\nRoughly speaking , the Viro method (for curves) can be described as follows : start with some real\nalgebraic curves (Ci ) whose Newton polygons are the 2-cells of a polygonal subdivision \u03c4 of a convex\npolygon \u2206. Then, under some assumptions on the Ci 's and on \u03c4 , the Viro Theorem asserts that\nthere exists a real algebraic curve with Newton polygon \u2206 obtained as a topological gluing of the\ncurves Ci . One of the hypothesis of Viro's theorem is that the subdivision \u03c4 should be convex, i.e.\nthere should exist a convex piecewise-linear affine function \u03bb : \u2206 \u2192 R whose domains of linearity\nare exactly the Newton polygons of the curves Ci . Notice that non-convex subdivisions do exist (see\n[CH80]), an example is depicted in Figure 2.\nIt is an open problem to know whether the convexity hypothesis is necessary or not. More precisely\nit is not known whether a curve patchworked from a non-convex subdivision is isotopic to a real\nalgebraic curve with Newton polygon \u2206 (see [dLW98] and [IS02]). I. Itenberg and E. Shustin proved\nin [IS02] that in the case of CP 2 or of the geometrically ruled rational surfaces \u03a3n there always exists\nBoth authors are very grateful to the Max Planck Institute f\u00fcr Mathematik in Bonn for its financial support and\nexcellent working conditions.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification : 14P25\nKey words : topology of real algebraic curves, Viro method, dessin d'enfants, rational ruled surfaces\n\n1\n\n\fa real pseudoholomorphic curve isotopic to the patchworked one. Note that it is still unknown if\nthere exists a real nonsingular pseudoholomorphic curve in RP 2 which is not isotopic to a real\nnonsingular algebraic curve of the same degree.\nIf the convexity hypothesis in the Viro method turned out to be necessary in general it could lead\nto such examples of \"non-algebraic pseudoholomorphic curves\". On the other hand if the convexity\nhypothesis could be removed it would simplify greatly the Viro construction since it is often rather\ntechnical to check whether a given subdivision is convex. Moreover this approach would give a\ndeeper insight or at least a new interpretation of the Viro method. This work is a first step in the\nstudy of the need of the convexity hypothesis.\nTrigonal curves are those curves in \u03a3n whose Newton polygon is the triangle \u2206n with vertices (0, 0),\n(0, 3) and (3n, 0). In this article we prove that we can get rid of the convexity hypothesis for trigonal\ncurves. Namely, any curve patchworked from \u2206n is an algebraic trigonal curve in \u03a3n (with Newton\npolygon \u2206n ). In fact we construct curves with prescribed positions with respect to the natural pencil\nof lines of \u03a3n . In the convex case, the pencil of lines has been studied by L. Lopez de Medrano in\n[LdM].\nWe want to construct a trigonal curve C out of a trigonal patchwork. The strategy is the following.\nWe first cut C in several pieces which are the intersection of C with some portions of the pencil of\nlines in \u03a3n . All these pieces are given by the subdivision of \u2206n and will be algebraic. In [IS02],\nItenberg and Shustin glue these pieces topologically in order to obtain a real pseudoholomorphic\ncurve.\nSince we deal with trigonal curve we are able to use a particular case of \"dessins d'enfants\" which are\ncalled real rational graphs. This technic was introduced in real algebraic geometry independently\nby S. Yu. Orevkov in [Ore03] and by S. Natanzon, B. Shapiro and A. Vainshtein in [NSV02].\nThe position of a real trigonal curve with respect to the pencil in \u03a3n is encoded by three linearly\ndependent real polynomials (see [Ore03] or section 4). Real rational graphs give a necessary and\nsufficient condition for the existence of three linearly dependent real polynomials in one variable\nwhose roots realize a given real arrangement. Via Riemann existence theorem they provide an\nexistence criterion for a given trigonal curve.\nIn fact, we will use a slight generalization of these objects. To glue algebraically the pieces of our\ncurve we indeed need to perform some surgery on dessins d'enfants enhanced with the data of the\nsign of some characteristic polynomials. These are what we call signed real rational graphs. Once\nglued together in a coherent way the signed real rational graphs obtained for each piece yield a\ndessin d'enfant which corresponds to a curve with the required topology.\nOrganization of this article\nIn section 2, we recall some facts about rational geometrically ruled surfaces. In section 3, we explain\nthe patchwork construction and give a patchwork theorem for real algebraic trigonal curves without\nany convexity assumption (Theorem 3.4). We explain in section 4 how to encode the topology of\na trigonal curve in a sign array. In section 5 we define an order on the polygons of a patchwork\nwhich is used in section 6 to extract a sign array from a trigonal patchwork. We state there our\nmain result (Theorem 6.2) . The rest of the paper is devoted to the proof of this theorem. The\nmain tool of this proof, signed real rational graphs, is defined in section 7. In section 8 we associate\na signed real rational graph to each piece of the pencil of line given by the order on the polygons of\na patchwork. We glue all these graph in section 9 and check in section 10 that the obtained signed\nreal rational graph corresponds to a real algebraic trigonal curve which has the topology prescribed\nby the patchwork.\n\n2\n\n\fNotation\nAll polynomials in two variables C(X, Y ) are considered as polynomials in the variable Y whose coefficients are polynomials in the variable X. By the discriminant of C(X, Y ) we mean the discriminant\nof C(X, Y ) with respect to the variable Y .\nSuppose that a coordinate system of RP 1 is fixed. The point [0 : 1] (resp. [1 : 0]) is denoted by 0\n(resp.\u221e), and the points [x : y] such that xy > 0 (resp. xy < 0) are called positive (resp. negative).\nThe embedding of R into RP 1 given by x 7\u2192 [x : 1] induces an orientation of RP 1 . Given two points\nA and B in RP 1 , the segment [A; B] is the connected component of RP 1 \\ {A, B} oriented from A\nto B for this orientation.\nWhen there is no ambiguity, the two words \"curve\" and \"polynomial\" are used to designate either\na polynomial C(X, Y ) or the curve defined by this polynomial.\n\n2\n\nRational geometrically ruled surfaces\n\nThe nth rational geometrically ruled surface, denoted by \u03a3n , is the surface obtained by taking four\ncopies of C2 with coordinates (x, y), (x2 , y2 ), (x3 , y3 ) and (x4 , y4 ), and by gluing them along (C\u2217 )2\nwith the identifications (x2 , y2 ) = (1/x, y/xn ), (x3 , y3 ) = (x, 1/y) and (x4 , y4 ) = (1/x, xn /y). Let\nus denote by E (resp. B and F ) the algebraic curve in \u03a3n defined by the equation {y3 = 0} (resp.\n{y = 0} and {x = 0}). The coordinate system (x, y) is called standard. The projection \u03c0 : (x, y) 7\u2192 x\non C2 defines a C1 -bundle structure on C2 which is extendable up to a CP 1 -bundle structure on\n\u03a3n . The intersection numbers of B and F are respectively B \u25e6 B = n, F \u25e6 F = 0 and B \u25e6 F = 1.\nThe surface \u03a3n has a natural real structure induced by the complex conjugation in C2 , and the real\npart R\u03a3n of \u03a3n is a torus if n is even and a Klein bottle if n is odd. The restriction of \u03c0 on R\u03a3n\ndefines a pencil of lines denoted by L.\nThe group H2 (\u03a3n , Z) is isomorphic to Z \u00d7 Z and is generated by the classes of B and F . Moreover,\none has E = B \u2212 nF . An algebraic curve on \u03a3n is said to be of bidegree (k, l) if it realizes the\nhomology class kB + lF in H2 (\u03a3n , Z). Its equation in \u03a3n \\ E is\nk\nX\n\nak\u2212i (X, Z)Y i\n\ni=0\n\nwhere aj (X, Z) is a homogeneous polynomial of degree nj + l. A curve of bidegree (3, 0) is called a\ntrigonal curve on \u03a3n .\nIn the rational geometrically ruled surfaces, we study real curves up to isotopy with respect to L.\nTwo curves are said to be isotopic with respect to the fibration L if there exists an isotopy of R\u03a3n\nwhich transforms the first curve to the second one, and which maps each line of L to another line\nof L. In this paper, curves in a rational geometrically ruled surface are depicted up to isotopy with\nrespect to L.\nDefinition 2.1 An algebraic curve C of bidegree (k, l) in \u03a3n is said to be L-nonsingular if C is\nnonsingular and if for any fiber F in \u03a3n , the set F \u2229 C contains at least k \u2212 1 points.\n\n3\n\nPatchworking real algebraic trigonal curves\n\nHere, we explain the patchworking method for curves. The general patchworking Theorem, which\nuses the convexity of the subdivision, can be found in [Vir84], [Vir89], [Vir], [Ris92] and [IS03]. Our\n3\n\n\fpatchwork Theorem, Theorem 3.4, does not require this convexity assumption, yet it works only for\ntrigonal curves.\n\n3.1\n\nChart of a real polynomial\n\nThis is the key notion of the Viro method. A chart of a real polynomial C(X, Y ) is a way to draw\nthe curve defined by C in (R\u2217 )2 in the union of 4 symmetric copies of its Newton polygon. The\nNewton polygon of a polynomial F will be denoted by \u2206(F ).\nGiven a convex polygon \u2206 in R2 with vertices in Z2 , one can define the so called moment map from\n(R\u2217+ )2 to the interior of \u2206 as follows\n\u03bc\u2206 : (R\u2217+ )2 \u2192\n(x, y)\n\nP\n\n7\u2192\n\nI(\u2206)\nxi y j .(i,j)\ni j\n(i,j)\u2208\u2206\u2229Z2 x y\n\n(i,j)\u2208\u2206\u2229Z2\n\nP\n\n.\n\nIf dim(\u2206) = 2, then \u03bc\u2206 is a diffeomorphism. For a pair (\u01eb1 , \u01eb2 ) \u2208 {+, \u2212}2 , we denote by s\u01eb1,\u01eb2 the\nsymmetry\nof R2 given by s\u01eb1 ,\u01eb2 (x, y) = (\u01eb1 x, \u01eb2 y). For a convex polygon \u2206 in (R+ )2 , we define \u2206\u2217\nS\nas (\u01eb1 ,\u01eb2 )\u2208{+,\u2212}2 s\u01eb1 ,\u01eb2 (\u2206).\nDefinition 3.1 Let C(X, Y ) be a real polynomial. The chart of C(X, Y ), denoted by Ch(C), is the\nclosure of the set\n[\ns\u01eb1,\u01eb2 \u25e6 \u03bc\u2206(C) \u25e6 s\u01eb1,\u01eb2 ({(x, y) \u2208 R\u2217\u01eb1 \u00d7 R\u2217\u01eb2 |C(x, y) = 0})\n(\u01eb1 ,\u01eb2 )\u2208{0,1}2\n\nIt is clear that Ch(C) \u2282 \u2206\u2217 .\n\n3.2\n\nGluing of charts\nP\n\nai,j X i Y j be a polynomial and \u03b3 be a face of \u2206(C).\nP\nDefinition 3.2 The truncation of C(X, Y ) on \u03b3 is the polynomial (i,j)\u2208\u03b3 ai,j X i Y j .\nThe polynomial C(X, Y ) is totally nondegenerate if the truncation of C to any face of \u2206(C) is\nnonsingular in (C\u2217 )2 .\nLet C(X, Y ) =\n\nA patchwork is a way to glue together the charts of real algebraic curves.\nDefinition 3.3 Let \u2206 be a convex polygon with vertices in Z2 . A patchwork with support \u2206 is a\npair (\u03c4, (Ci (X, Y ))1\u2264i\u2264r ) such that\n\u2022 \u03c4 is a subdivision of \u2206,\n\u2022 the (Ci (X, Y )) are real algebraic curves,\n\u2022 for any 2-cell of \u03c4 , there is one and only one curve Ci whose Newton polygon is this polygon,\n\u2022 for any edge \u03b3 of \u03c4 , the truncations on \u03b3 of two polynomials whose Newton polygon contains\n\u03b3 coincide.\nIf \u2206 is the triangle with vertices (0, 0), (0, 3) and (3n, 0) and if the coefficient of Y 3 of any curve\nCi (X, Y ) is either 0 or 1, we say that the patchwork is trigonal of degree n.\nAs we deal with nonsingular curves, we will consider patchworks satisfying the following condition\n4\n\n\f(1) Each of the polynomials Ci (X, Y ) is totally nondegenerate.\nThe next theorem is a corollary of Theorem 6.2 and will be proved in section 6.\nTheorem 3.4 Let \u03a0 be a trigonal patchwork which satisfies hypothesis (1) above. Then there exists\na real algebraic trigonal curve in \u03a3n whose chart is isotopic to \u222a1\u2264i\u2264r Ch(Ci ).\nThrough all this paper, we will consider trigonal patchworks which satisfy one more condition. This\ncondition is due to the fact that we construct curves which have a generic position with respect to\nthe pencil of lines. This condition is a technical ingredient in the proof of Theorem 3.4. One can\nalways perturb slightly the curves involved in a patchwork so that they satisfy this condition, hence\nit does not appear in the statement of Theorem 3.4.\ni\n(2) for any i \u2208 {1, . . . , r}, the curves Ci (X, Y ) and \u2202C\n\u2202Y (X, Y ) have the maximal number of inter\u2217\n2\nsection points in (C ) among curves with fixed Newton polygon \u2206(Ci ).\n\nRemark : The last condition simply says that the curve has only ordinary tangency points with\nthe vertical pencil of lines in (C\u2217 )2 and that none of these points lie on a toric divisor corresponding\nto a horizontal edge in the toric surface associated to \u2206(Ci ).\nWe point out a consequence of condition (2) : suppose that Ci (X, Y ) = aj (X)Y k + aj\u22121 Y k+1 +\naj\u22122 (X)Y k+2 . . . + aj\u2212l (X)Y k+l and that aj (x0 ) = 0 (resp. aj\u2212l (x0 ) = 0) with x0 \u2208 R\u2217 , then\naj\u22121 (x0 ) 6= 0 (resp. aj\u2212l+1 (x0 ) 6= 0).\n\n4\n\nThe sign array of a real algebraic trigonal curve\n\n4.1\n\nPolynomials of degree 3 in one variable\n\nLet us first consider a real polynomial of degree 3 in one variable C(Y ) = Y 3 + a1 Y 2 + a2 Y + a3 . It\nis well known that the following three numbers play an important role in the resolution of such an\nequation\nP = a2 \u2212\n\na21\n3 ,\n\nQ = a3 \u2212\n\na2 a1\n3\n\n+\n\n2a31\n27 ,\n\nD = \u22124P 3 \u2212 27Q2 .\n\nThe number D is the discriminant of the polynomial C. In particular one has\n\u2022 if D > 0, then C has three distinct real roots,\n\u2022 if D < 0, then C has one real root and two complex conjugated non-real roots,\n\u2022 if D = 0 and Q < 0, then C has a real double root y1 and a simple real root y2 and y1 < y2 ,\n\u2022 if D = 0 and Q > 0, then C has a real double root y1 and a simple real root y2 and y1 > y2 ,\n\u2022 if D = 0 and Q = 0, then P = 0 and C has a real triple root.\nRemark : under the change of variable Y 7\u2192 \u2212Y , the numbers P and D are invariant and the\nnumber Q turns into its opposite.\n\n5\n\n\f4.2\n\nEncoding the topology of a real algebraic trigonal curve\n\nLet us now consider a L-nonsingular real algebraic trigonal curve C in \u03a3n . Let us choose a standard\ncoordinate system (x, y) on \u03a3n such that the fiber at infinity intersects C in 3 distinct points (not\nnecessarily real). The equation of C in C2 = \u03a3n \\ (E \u222a F\u221e ) is\nC(X, Y ) = Y 3 + a1 (X)Y 2 + a2 (X)Y + a3 (X)\nwhere aj (X) is a polynomial of degree jn.\nAs in section 4.1, define the three following polynomial in one variable\nP (X) = a2 (X) \u2212\n\na1 (X)2\n,\n3\n\nQ(X) = a3 (X) \u2212\n\na2 (X)a1 (X)\n3\n\n+\n\n2a1 (X)3\n,\n27\n\nD(X) = \u22124P (X)3 \u2212 27Q(X)2 .\n\nThe curve C is L-nonsingular so D(X) has only simple roots. Denote by x1 < x2 < . . . < xl\nthe roots of D(X). Denote also by s0 the sign of D(x) with x < x1 and si the sign of Q(xi ) for\ni \u2208 {1 . . . l}.\nDefinition 4.1 The sign array [s0 , s1 . . . sl ] is called the sign array of the curve C in the chosen\nstandard coordinate system.\nFrom the definition one can see that the sign array determines the position of a L-nonsingular real\nalgebraic trigonal curve in \u03a3n with respect to L and conversely provided that a standard coordinate\nsystem has been chosen.\n\na)\n\nb)\nFigure 1:\n\nExample : Consider the trigonal curve on \u03a31 depicted in Figure 1a) and suppose that a standard\ncoordinate system is chosen such that the vertical edges of the rectangle represent the fiber at\ninfinity. Then the sign array of this trigonal curve is [+, + \u2212 + + ++].\n\n5\n\nAn order on the polygons of a subdivision\n\nLet \u2206 be the triangle with vertices (0, 0), (0, d) and (nd, 0) and let \u03c4 be a subdivision of \u2206 into\nconvex integer polygons. We give an algorithm to put an order on the polygons of \u03c4 . In the Viro\nmethod, it will correspond to the order in which the polygons are scanned by the pencil of lines.\nRoughly speaking, the polygons will be scanned from the left to the right and only one polygon\nwill be scanned at the same time except if it contains a horizontal edge. If two polygons have a\nhorizontal edge in common, they will be scanned simultaneously by the pencil.\n\n6\n\n\f3\n\u03b4\n\n\u03b4\n\n3\n\n\u03b4\n\n6\n\n\u03b4\n\n1\n\n9\n\n2\n\n\u03b4\n\n10\n\n1\n\u03b4\n\n2\n\n1\n\u03b4\n\n4\n\n2\n\n3\n\u03b4\n\n5\n\n7\n\u03b4\n\n\u03b4\n\n7\n\n12\n\n8\n\nFigure 2: Order on polygons\nIn the procedure, \u03b8 is the current ordered subset of the 2-dimensional cells of \u03c4 , and \u03be is the set of\nremaining cells. The procedure starts with \u03b8 = () and \u03be = {2-dimensional cells of \u03c4 }. Perform the\nfollowing operations until \u03be = \u2205.\nStep 1 : Suppose that \u03b8 = (\u03a61 , . . . , \u03a6j\u22121 ) and put\nS\n\u2022 U = \u03b4\u2208\u03be \u03b4,\n\u2022 \u039b = {(x, y)|x = min(z,y)\u2208U (z)}\n(i.e. \u039b is the left side of U ),\n\u2022 \u03bee = {\u03b4 \u2208 \u03be|\u03b4 has an edge which is contained in \u039b}\n(i.e. elements of \u03bee are the leftest polygons of \u03be),\n\ne = {(\u03b4, (x, y)) \u2208 \u03bee \u00d7 \u039b|(x, y) \u2208 \u03b4, y = max(z,w)\u2208\u03b4 (w) and \u03b4 has no horizontal edge containing\n\u2022 \u039b\n(x, y)}\n(i.e. we take pairs (\u03b4, (x, y)) made of a polygon \u03b4 and a distinguished vertex (x, y) of \u03b4 such\nthat (x, y) is the higher point of \u03b4 and is not on one of its horizontal edge),\n\ne = min \u2032\n\u2022 {(\u03b40 , (x0 , y0 ))} = {(\u03b4, (x, y)) \u2208 \u039b|y\ne (w)}\n(\u03b4 ,(z,w))\u2208\u039b\n\ne with the distinguished vertex of smaller ordinate).\n(i.e. we take the element of \u039b\n\nStep 2 : Here we look for all the polygons which will be scanned at the same time by the pencil of\nlines.\nDefine by induction some polygons (\u03b4i )0\u2264i\u2264k , where \u03b40 has been defined at step 1 : if \u03b4l shares a\nhorizontal edge with a polygon \u03b4\u2032 , distinct from \u03b4l\u22121 if l > 0, then put \u03b4l+1 = \u03b4\u2032 . Else, put k = l\nand \u03a6j = {\u03b4i , 0 \u2264 i \u2264 k}.\nStep 3 : Put \u03be = \u03be \\ \u03a6j . If x0 > 1 then also put \u03b8 = (\u03a61 , . . . , \u03a6j ).\nRemark : in this algorithm, we \"throw away\" polygons corresponding to curves of degree 1 in Y\nand which do not have a horizontal edge of height 1.\nExample : Applying this algorithm to the (non-convex) subdivision shown in Figure 2, one obtains\n\u03b8 = ({\u03b41 }, {\u03b42 }, {\u03b43 , \u03b44 }, {\u03b46 , \u03b47 , \u03b48 }, {\u03b49 }, {\u03b410 }).\n7\n\n\fFigure 3:\nLet \u03a6 be an element of \u03b8 and \u03b4 a polygon of \u03a6.\nDefinition 5.1 The height of \u03b4 is defined as max(x,y)\u2208\u03b4 (y). The height of \u03a6 is the maximum of the\nheights of the polygons of \u03a6.\nNote that by construction, all the elements of \u03a6 have height at least 2.\n\n6\n\nThe sign array associated to a trigonal patchwork\n\nTo a trigonal patchwork, we associate a sign array encoding the position that the curve we want to\nconstruct would have with respect to L. This array is constructed studying where should be located\nthe roots of the discriminant of the desired curve, and what should be the sign of Q(X) at those\npoints.\nLet \u03a0 be a trigonal patchwork satisfying conditions (1) and (2) of section 3. Following what happens\nwhen the subdivision is convex (see [LdM]), the roots x0 \u2208 R of D(X) will be obtained out of \u03a0 in\nexactly three different ways:\n\u2022 any root in R\u2217 of the discriminant a curve Ci of the patchwork gives rise to such a root x0 ,\n\u2022 suppose there is a horizontal edge of height 1 contained in a polygon \u03b41 of height at least 2\nand in a polygon \u03b42 of height 1. The polygon \u03b41 corresponds in the patchwork to a curve of\nequation \u03b1Y 3 + a1 (x)Y 2 + a2 (X)Y and the polygon \u03b42 corresponds to a curve of equation\na2 (X)Y + a3 (X).\nThen a root of x1 \u2208 R\u2217 of a2 (X) such that a1 (x1 ) and a3 (x1 ) have the same sign (see Figure\n1b)) gives rise to two such roots x0 .\n\u2022 suppose there is a horizontal edge of height 2 contained in a polygon \u03b41 of height 3 and in a\npolygon \u03b42 of height 2. The polygon \u03b41 corresponds in the patchwork to a curve of equation\nY 3 +a1 (x)Y 2 and the polygon \u03b42 corresponds to a curve of equation a1 (X)Y 2 +a2 (X)Y +a3 (X).\nThen a root x1 \u2208 R\u2217 of a1 (X) such that a2 (x1 ) is positive (see Figure 4a)) gives rise to two\nsuch roots x0 .\nFirst, we associate two lists of signs to each element of \u03b8.\n\n6.1\n\nLists of signs associated to an element of \u03b8\n\nLet \u03a6i be the ith element of \u03b8 and let be a1 (X), a2 (X) and a3 (X) all the polynomials that occur in\nthe polygons of \u03a6i .

For this reason, we won't write explicitly the pairs of signs on signed real\nrational graph associated to trigonal curves in the rest of this paper.\nHere we give a list of necessary and sufficient conditions for a signed real rational graph to be\nassociated to some L-nonsingular real algebraic trigonal curve.

The intersections of the curve C(X, Y, Z)\nwith the exceptional divisor correspond to the roots of a1 (X, Z).

Taking into account the coordinate\nsystem chosen to write the equation of C, we obtain a marked real rational graph. Let us turn\nit into a signed real rational graph \u0393\u00b1 (C) : the pair of signs on each connected component of\n(\u0393 \u2229 RP 1 )\\(f \u22121 ({0, 1, \u221e})\u222a {0, \u221e}) is the pair formed by the sign of a2 (X, Z)2 \u2212 4a1 (X, Z)a3 (X, Z)\nand the sign of a1 (X) on this component.\nDefinition 7.9 The graph \u0393\u00b1 (C) is called the signed real rational graph associated to the polynomial\nC .\nThis definition of \u0393\u00b1 for a curve of bidegree (2, n) is motivated by the fact that when we will glue\ntogether the curves of the patchwork in section 9, the topology coming from a curve of degree 2 will\nbe encoded by the sign of a1 (X) (see Figure 4).\n14\n\n\fNote that the knowledge of the real rational graph and the topology of C does not allow one to\nrecover the sign real rational graph. Indeed, the sign of a1 (X) can be recovered neither from the\nreal rational graph nor from the topology of the curve.\nHowever, when the curve C will be used in a patchwork, the sign of some other polynomials will\nallow us to recover the sign of a1 (X).\n\n8\n\nAssociating a signed real rational graph to any element of \u03b8\n(+,\u2212)\n\n1\n0\n0\n1\n\n(\u2212,\u2212)\n\n(+,\u2212)\n\n8\n\n11\n00\n00\n11\n0\n\n8\n\n11\n00\n\n11\n000\n\n8\n\n0\n\n(+,+)\n11\n00\n\n(+,+)\n11\n00\n00\n11\n\na){\u03b41 }\n\nb){\u03b42 }\n\nc){\u03b43 , \u03b44 }\n\nFigure 8:\n\n11\n00\n11\n00\n00\n11\n\n0\n1\n0\n\na){\u03b46 , \u03b47 , \u03b48 }\n\nb){\u03b49 }\n\n0\n\n8\n\n8\n\n1\n0\n\n8\n\n1\n00\n\n11\n00\n\nc){\u03b410 }\n\nFigure 9:\nLet \u03a0 be a trigonal patchwork of degree n satisfying conditions (1) and (2) of section 3 and let\n\u03b8 = (\u03a61 , . . . , \u03a6k ) be the k-tuple constructed in section 5. We are going to associate a signed real\nrational graph \u0393\u00b1 (\u03a6i ) to each \u03a6i . Dealing with charts of polynomials implies that a coordinate\nsystem is fixed. The signed real rational graphs will be constructed in this coordinate system.\n\n8.1\n\n\u03a6i is of height 2\n\nHere we consider signed real rational graphs of curves of bidegree (2, n) in \u03a3n . As mentioned in\nsection 7.3, it cannot be extracted only from the knowledge of the real rational graphs of those\ncurves and of their topology. However, when such a curve is used in a patchwork of a trigonal curve,\none can recover the sign of a1 (X) out of this patchwork.\nIndeed, if \u03b4 is a polygon of height 2 in a trigonal patchwork, let p = (x, 2) be the leftest point\nof height 2 of \u03b4 (i.e. x = min(z,2)\u2208\u03b4 (z)). Then, [(0, 3); p] is an edge of the subdivision, and any\ncurve of degree 3 in the patchwork whose Newton polygon contains this edge prescribes the sign of\na1 (X) for small values of X: if the chart of one of these cubic intersect the edge [(0, 3); p] (resp.\n\n15\n\n\f[(0, 3); (\u2212x, 2)]), then a1 (X) is negative for small positive (resp. negative) values of X. This is\nbecause [(0, 3); (\u2212x, 2)] is of integer length 1 and the coefficient of Y 3 is 1.\nFor this reason, we will not write explicitly the pairs of signs on signed real rational graphs associated\nto a curve of bidegree (2, n) in a trigonal patchwork.\n8.1.1\n\n\u03a6i = {\u03b4}\n\nThat means that \u03b4 is the Newton polygon of a curve C(X, Y ) = a1 (X)Y 2 + a2 (X)Y + a3 (X) in\nthe patchwork with a1 (X) a monomial and a3 (X) a non zero polynomial. Consider this curve as a\ncurve of bidegree (2, n) in \u03a3n , i.e. homogenize the curve C in the following way :\nC(X, Y, Z) = a1 (X, Z)Y 2 + a2 (X, Z)Y + a3 (X, Z)\nwhere aj (X, Z) is a homogeneous polynomial of degree jn. This curve may have singular points on\nthe fibers {X = 0} and {Z = 0}.\nConsider the signed real rational graph \u0393\u00b1 (C(X, Y, Z)) constructed in section 7.3.

Considering C2 as\na curve in \u03a34 , we have\nC2 (X, Y, Z) = aXZ 3 Y 2 + bZ 8 Y + cZ 12 .\nThen \u0393(C2 ) is given by the real rational function\nf\u03b42 (x) =\n\n\u2212a4 X 4\n\u2212a4 X 4 Z 12\n=\n.\nb2 Z 16 \u2212 4acXZ 15 \u2212 a4 X 4 Z 12\nb2 Z 4 \u2212 4acZ 3 \u2212 a4 X 4\n\nThen, according to the chart of C2 , the real rational graph of {\u03b42 } is as depicted in Figure 8b). The\nchart of the curve corresponding to the polygon \u03b41 implies that a1 (X) is negative (resp. positive)\nfor positive (resp. negative) values of X.

So, the gluing\nof \u0393\u00b1 (\u03a6i ) and \u0393\u00b1 (\u03a6i+1 ) is determined by the neighborhood of \u221e in \u0393\u00b1 (Ci ) and 0 in \u0393\u00b1 (Ci+1 ).\n\n(+,s) (+,s)\n\n(+,s)\n\n(+,s)\n\n(+,s)\n\u03b3\n2\n1\n\n\u03b4\n\n1\n\nx\n\n1\n\nx\n\n8\n\np\n\u03b4\n\n0\n\n2\n\n0\n\n(+,s')\n(+,s')\nroot of\norder 2a\n\n(+,s')\n\n(+,s')\n\n(+,s')\n\nroot of\norder 2a\n\na)\n\nb)\nFigure 17:\n\nA simple calculation shows that\n\u2022 if x1 is an integer, then \u221e (resp. 0) is a root of order 2(2x0 \u2212 x1 ) of Ri \u2212 Si (resp.

In this\nsection, we show that the signed real rational graph \u0393\u00b1 (\u03a0) constructed in section 9 out of \u03a0\ncorresponds to a L-nonsingular real trigonal algebraic curve in \u03a3n which realizes the sign array of\nthe corresponding patchwork.\nFirst, we check that \u0393\u00b1 (\u03a0) is the signed real rational graph of a L-nonsingular real trigonal algebraic\ncurve in \u03a3n . The only non-trivial part is to prove that the degree of \u0393\u00b1 (\u03a0) is 6n. In order to compute\nit, we count the number of preimages of 1. So we first have to count how many preimages of 1 each\nelement of \u03b8 brings to \u0393\u00b1 (\u03a0). According to section 9, this is equivalent to count how many preimages\nof 1 are lying on \u0393(\u03a6i ) \\ {0, \u221e} for all element \u03a6i of \u03b8.\n21\n\n\f1\n0\n\n00\n11\n\na)\n\n00\n11\n\n1\n0\n\n1\n0\n0\n1\n\n11\n00\n00\n11\n\n1\n0\n0\n1\n\n1\n0\n1\n0\n\n11\n00\n11\n00\n\n11\n00\n00\n11\n\n11\n00\n11\n00\n\nb)\n\n22\n\nFigure 18:\n\n00\n11\n11\n00\n00\n11\n\n11\n00\n11\n00\n\n11\n00\n00\n11\n11\n00\n\n11\n00\n00\n11\n\n1\n0\n0\n1\n\n00\n11\n11\n00\n00\n11\n\n8\n\nc)\n\n0\n11\n00\n\n11\n00\n1\n0\n\n1\n0\n1\n0\n\n\fFirst, we count the number of roots in C\u2217 of the discriminant of a curve. Given a convex polygon \u03b4,\nthe quantity I(\u03b4) is the number of integer points in the interior of \u03b4 and \u2202(\u03b4) denotes the number\nof integer points of the boundary of \u03b4 which have neither a maximal nor a minimal ordinate.\nLemma 10.1 Let C(X, Y ) be a totally nondegenerate curve with Newton polygon \u03b4. Then, the\ndiscriminant of C(X, Y ) has 2I(\u03b4) + \u2202(\u03b4) roots in C\u2217 counted with multiplicity.\nProof : Let us consider the closure of C(X, Y ) in CP 2 and the rational map \u03c0 : CP 2 99K CP 1 given\nby \u03c0([x : y : z]) = [x : y]. It is well known that the genus of the normalization of C is I(\u03b4). So,\napplying the Riemann Hurwitz formula to the restriction of \u03c0 to C, we have\n2 \u2212 2I(\u03b4) = 2d \u2212 r1 \u2212 r2\nwhere d = degY (C), r1 is the number of roots (counted with multiplicity) in C\u2217 of the discriminant\nof C(X, Y ) and r2 is the sum of the tangency order of local branches of C along {X = 0} and\n{Z = 0}. As C(X, Y ) is totally nondegenerate, we have r2 = 2d \u2212 \u2202(\u03b4) \u2212 2, so\nr1 = 2I(\u03b4) + \u2202(\u03b4).\nThe Lemma is proved.\n\n\u0003\n\nCorollary 10.2 The real rational graph \u0393\u00b1 (\u03a0) constructed out of a trigonal patchwork of degree n\nis of degree 6n.\nProof : It is clear from the construction and the hypothesis on the trigonal patchwork that the\ndegree of \u0393\u00b1 (\u03a0) is equal to the sum of the numbers of preimages of 1 in \u0393(\u03a6i ) \\ {0, \u221e} for all \u03a6i in\n\u03b8. From section 8 and Lemma 10.1, we know that this number is equal to 2I(\u2206) + \u2202(\u2206) which is\nequal to 6n.\n\u0003\nProposition 10.3 The signed real rational graph \u0393\u00b1 (\u03a0) is realizable by a L-nonsingular real algebraic trigonal curve C in \u03a3n .\nProof : The degree of \u0393\u00b1 (\u03a0) is given by Corollary 10.2 and all the other conditions of Proposition\n7.7 are satisfied by construction.\n\u0003\nChoose a standard coordinate system on \u03a3n such that the point \u221e on \u0393\u00b1 (\u03a0) corresponds to the\nfiber at infinity and let SAC be the sign array of the curve C in this coordinate system.\nProposition 10.4 Under the hypothesis (1) and (2) of section 3, the sign array SAC and the sign\narray constructed out of \u03a0 in section 4.2 coincide.\nProof : Let [s0 , s1 . . . su ] (resp. [t0 , t1 . . . tv ]) be the sign array SAC (resp. associated to the patchwork). First note that a direct consequence of sections 6, 8 and 9 is that u = v, i.e. both curves\nhave the same number of tangency points with the pencil of vertical lines. Hence, to prove Theorem\n6.2, we have just have to prove that sj = tj for any j.\nIt is clear from sections 6, 8 and 9 that both sj and tj come from the same real xj for some \u03a6i .\n3\nwhich realize \u0393\u00b1 (\u03a0).\nChoose a real rational map f = \u22124P\n27Q2\nIf \u03a6i contains no polygon with a horizontal edge of height 2, then xj corresponds to a root of the\ndiscriminant of a curve of \u03a0 whose Newton polygon is in \u03a6i . Hence, sj which is the sign of Q(xj ),\n23\n\n\fis the second element of the pair of signs which labels \u0393\u00b1 (\u03a6i ) near xj . But according to section 6,\nthis is also tj .\nIf \u03a6i contains a polygon with a horizontal edge of height 2, denote by a1 (X) the polynomial corresponding to this edge. Let a be the number of roots of a1 (X) counted with multiplicity which are\nstrictly between 0 and xj and let \u03c3 be the sign of a1 (x) for x \u2208 R\u2217 small enough with the same\nsign as xj . There are two possibilities, each of them can checked directly from the construction of\n\u0393\u00b1 (\u03a6i ).\n\u2022 If xj is not a root of a1 (x), then sj = (\u22121)a \u03c3 = tj .\n\u2022 If xj is a root of a1 (x), then xj gives rise to two elements of both sign arrays, say sj , sj+1 , tj\nand tj+1 . We have sj = \u2212(\u22121)a \u03c3 = tj and sj+1 = (\u22121)a \u03c3 = tj+1 .\nSo in any case, we have sj = tj .\n\n\u0003\n\nExample : One can check on Figure 18c), that the obtained real rational graph corresponds to\na non singular real algebraic trigonal curve realizing the sign array of the patchwork depicted in\nFigure 3.\n\n11\n\nRemark on an equivariant version Theorem 3.4\n\nWe were guided in this work by the following observation : the position of the real part of a\nnonsingular real algebraic curve in \u03a3n with respect to the pencil of lines is totally encoded by the\nsign array realized by some collection of polynomials in one variable, namely the leading coefficients\nof some signed subresultant sequences (see [BPR03] or [Hon] for example). It seems to us that this\nobservation could lead to interesting results in real algebraic geometry, especially in the study of\nthe need of convexity in patchworking.\nIn the case of trigonal curves, the polynomials whose sign array encode the topology of the real\npart of the curve are exactly, with notation of section 4, the polynomials P (X), Q(X) and D(X).\nMoreover, such three polynomials with a prescribed sign array can be constructed using signed real\nrational graphs.\nOn the other hand, real rational graphs carry much more informations than the knowledge of the\ntopology of the real part of real algebraic curves. Indeed, one can extract the position with respect to\nthe pencil of lines of the complexification of any real trigonal curve out of its associated real rational\ngraph. Hence, one can consider not only isotopies of curves in the real part of the surface \u03a3n but\nalso equivariant isotopies of curves in \u03a3n . That means that it is possible to state an equivariant\nversion of Theorem 3.4 and Theorem 6.2.\nProving such an equivariant statement would carry us quite far away from our original framework.\nSo we only give the main ingredients needed in its formulation and in its proof.\nStep 1. In the patchwork construction, one can use complexification of lattice polygons and complex equivariant charts of real polynomials as defined in [IS02], [IS03] and [Vir]. Then, the\npatchwork procedure gives a piecewise smooth surface, invariant under the action of the complex conjugation, in the complexification of the triangle with vertices (0, 0), (0, 3) and (3n, 0).\nStep 2. One can use the braid monodromy factorization (see [KT00] or [KK03] for example) to\nencode the position of a complex algebraic curve in \u03a3n with respect to the pencil of lines. An\nequivariant version of this encoding, based on previous papers by Orevkov (see [Ore99] for\nexample), should be used to deal with real algebraic curves.\n24\n\n\fStep 3. As we associated a sign array to a trigonal patchwork (in section 6), one can associate\nin a similar way an equivariant braid monodromy factorization to an equivariant trigonal\npatchwork (defined in Step 1).\nStep 4. One can extract the equivariant braid monodromy factorization of the real trigonal algebraic curve constructed in section 10 out of the signed real rational graph constructed in\nsection 9 and prove that it coincides with the one constructed in Step 3.\n\nReferences\n[Ber06]\n\nB.
