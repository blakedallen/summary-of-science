In the region of anomalous group-velocity\ndispersion (GVD), by introducing the retarded time T \u2032 = t\u2032 \u2212 k1 x\u2032 = t\u2032 \u2212 x\u2032 /vg , Eq. (1) is\nnormalized as\n1\n2\n(2)\niu\u2032\u2032x\u2032\u2032 + u\u2032\u2032T T + |u\u2032\u2032 | u\u2032\u2032 = i\u03b5P \u2032\u2032 [u]\n2\np\nin terms of T = T \u2032 /T0 , x\u2032\u2032 = x\u2032 /LD = x\u2032 |k2 | /T02 and u\u2032\u2032 = |k2 | /\u03c3T02 u\u2032 [1]. Customarily,\n\nEq. (2) is referred to as optical nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation (NLSE), and its unperturbed\n\nversion supports distortionless propagation of a type of solitary wave called the bright or\ntemporal soliton [3].\nGenerally, waves travelling along the x-axis at speed v are expressible as functions of\n(x\u2212vt). A wave F (x, t) may be thought of as formed from the shape f (\u03b6) by the substitution\n\u03b6 = (x \u2212 vt), or else as built from the time signal h(\u03c4 ) by the substitution \u03c4 = (t \u2212 x/v).\nHere, the function f (\u03b6) with f (x) = F (x, 0) characterizes the \"waveshape\", and h(\u03c4 ) with\nh(t) = F (0, t) depicts the \"waveform\" [4]. Resulting pictures from the two standpoints\nfor the wave F (x, t) are that the \"waveshape\" changes and propagates along the x-axis\nas time elapses and the \"waveform\" distorts versus the retarded time \u03c4 as the distance x\nkeep increasing. These actually presents two different point of views for the visualization of\nscenario of soliton under perturbations.\nThe bright soliton propagating in the fiber governed by Eq. (2) was typically investigated\nby interchanging the roles of the retarded time T and the space x\u2032\u2032 and defining an \"initialvalue\" problem, or equivalently by directly treating the space x\u2032\u2032 as the evolution coordinate\nand defining a boundary-value problem. Accordingly, the aspect of waveform of the bright\nsoliton was taken into consideration and studies could benefit from the direct application [5,6]\nof the celebrated frameworks developed by Zakharov and Shabat (ZS) and Ablowitz-KaupNewell-Segur (AKNS). Nevertheless, to avoid complication of the ZS and AKNS schemes,\nother elaborate approaches were developed in the framework of direct expansion as well [7,8].\nIn contrast to the studies of bright soliton, the aspect of waveshape is extensively ex2\n\n\famined in other soliton problems with perturbations [6], including envelope soliton of the\nintegrable cubic NLSE in water and other applications [9,10]. Although results for the understanding of the waveform of bright soliton have been achieved, a natural question, how the\nwaveshape evolves in the real time or what the dynamics of bright soliton is, is inevitable to\narise. To answer this question, the corresponding mathematical model is essentially different\nfrom the one investigated in previous theories, and is also intractable in the ZS and AKNS\nschemes. Consequently, a new theoretical challenge turns up. In this letter, we introduce\nour theory for the subject.\nLet's start from the dimensionless form of Eq. (1) in the anomalous dispersion regime\nof the fiber\n1\niux + iut + utt + |u|2 u = i\u03b5P [u]\n(3)\n2\np\nwhere t = t\u2032 /t0 , x = x\u2032 /l = x\u2032 |k2 | /t20 , u = |k2 | /\u03c3t20 u\u2032 and t0 = |k2 | /k1 = vg\u22121 |dvg /d\u03c9| .\nObviously, instead of the usual T0 that is determined by the width of the input waveform\nin existing theories, a characteristic time, namely t0 that is determined by the working\nwavelength and nature of the fiber, is used in the normalization. Formally, Eq. (3) differs\nfrom Eq. (2) or the normal form of optical NLSE only by an additional term iut due to\ninvalidation of the retarded time, but the essential difference lies in that the time t here\nmust be treated as the evolution coordinate and an initial-value problem is consequently\ndefined, since the waveshape of bright soliton is to be taken into account. In the absence of\nperturbations, the bright soliton admitted by Eq. (3) is given by\nusol (x, t) = 2\u03b7sech2\u03b7(2\u03b6 + 1)[x \u2212\n\n1\nt \u2212 \u03c7\u2032 ]\n(2\u03b6 + 1)\n\n\u00d7 exp{\u2212i[2(\u03b6 2 \u2212 \u03b7 2 + \u03b6)x \u2212 2\u03b6t \u2212 \u03b81 ]}\n\n(4)\n\nprovided the initial waveshape is in the form\nusol (x, 0) = 2\u03b7sech2\u03b7(2\u03b6 + 1)[x \u2212 \u03c7\u2032 ]\n\u00d7 exp{\u2212i[2(\u03b6 2 \u2212 \u03b7 2 + \u03b6)x \u2212 \u03b81 ]}.\n3\n\n(5)\n\n\fFrom the general point of view of solitons under perturbations, if the perturbations turn\non, the bright soliton with a starting state of Eq. (5) to propagate in the fiber governed\nby Eq. (3) can not be described by Eq. (4), it undergoes a slow change in the time via\nthe variation of its parameters. Moreover, other wave modes come on to appear [6,11]. To\ncharacterize the picture, we introduce a slow time scale t1 = \u03b5t and assume that the solution\nof Eq. (3) is of the form\nu(t, z, t1 ) = [2\u03b7f (z) + \u03b5v(t, z, t1 )]e\u2212i\u03b8(z,t1 )\n\n(6)\n\nwhere f (z) = sechz, z = 2\u03b7(2\u03b6 + 1)(x \u2212 \u03b5\u22121\u03c7 \u2212 \u03c7\u2032 ) and \u03b8 = (Kz \u2212 \u03b5\u22121 \u03b80 \u2212 \u03b81 ). Also, we need\nfurther to assume that \u03b7, \u03b6, \u03c7, \u03c7\u2032 , K, \u03b80 , \u03b81 are dependent directly on t1 . Obviously, z is\nthe coordinate variable in the reference frame tied up to the bright soliton. Here, if we take\nt, z and t1 in place of t and x as new independent variables, the derivatives with respect to\ntime and space in Eq. (3) are thus replaced by\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u03b7t \u2202\n2\u03b6t1\n\u2202\n=\n\u2212 2\u03b7(2\u03b6 + 1)\u039b + \u03b5 1 z\n+\u03b5\nz\n\u2202t\n\u2202t\n\u2202z\n\u03b7 \u2202z\n(2\u03b6 + 1) \u2202z\n\u2202\n\u2202\n+\u03b5\n\u2212\u03b52\u03b7(2\u03b6 + 1)\u03c7\u2032t1\n\u2202z\n\u2202t1\n\n(7)\n\nand\n\u2202\n\u2202\n= 2\u03b7(2\u03b6 + 1)\n\u2202x\n\u2202z\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \u03c7t1 = \u039b is defined. Introducing Eqs. (6)-(8) into Eq. (3), we transform from\nthe laboratory frame into the soliton's one and get two equations from O(1) and O(\u03b5),\nrespectively. Examining the zeroth-order equation for O(1), we derive \u039b = (2\u03b6 + 1)\u22121 ,\n\u03b80t1 = \u03a9 = 2(\u03b6 2 + \u03b7 2 )\u039b and K = (\u03b6 2 \u2212 \u03b7 2 + \u03b6)\u039b\u03b7 \u22121. By virtue of these relations, we simplify\nthe first-order equation for O(\u03b5) as\n1\nvtt + i\u039b\u22121 vt \u2212 2\u03b7vzt + 2\u03b7 2 vzz + 8\u03b7 2 h2 (z)v + 4\u03b7 2 h2 (z)v \u2217 \u2212 2\u03b7 2 v = R(z)\n2\n\n(9)\n\nwhere asterisk \u2217 denotes the complex conjugate.

Expectably, a fresh equation comes out after the\nlinearization. Here, we should note that although the basic idea of the present linearization is\na natural extension of the normal scheme of multiple scale expansion [12], the implementation\nof the idea in handling such soliton problems as of the second order derivative with respect\nto time is original. As usual, extra freedoms for the purpose of preventing the occurrence of\nsecular terms are introduced and included in the source term. Taking advantage of Laplace\ntransform to solve Eq.

From our viewpoint,\nthe localized modes here is a kind of internal modes whose occurrence is acknowledged to\nbe intrinsic for nonintegrable models, for instance, the \u03c64 model [15]. Although it is not\nsufficient to conclude that the model we consider here is nonintegrable, the corresponding\nLax representation is really difficult to find. Returning to the restriction condition imposed\non the solution, we indicate that they can be satisfied by the extra freedoms we introduce\nin advance.

In accordance with the\nusual definition of the width w = 1/2\u03b7(2\u03b6 + b), we can derive a useful equation\n\n2\n\n3\n\nwt1 = 4\u03b7 w\nZ\n2\n\u2212w\n\nZ\n\n+\u221e\n\nIm(P ei\u03b8 ) tanh zsechzdz\n\n\u2212\u221e\n+\u221e\n\nRe(P ei\u03b8 )sechzdz.\n\n(29)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nNow, we generate some specific results by examining two cases. At first, we consider\nthe linear loss given by P [u] = \u2212\u03b11 u. This perturbation leads to Re(P ei\u03b8 ) = \u22122\u03b7\u03b11 sechz.\n8\n\n\fFrom Eq. (25), we compute \u03b7t1 = \u22122\u03b11 \u03b7\u039b, and then we obtain \u03b7 = \u03b70 e\u22122\u03b11 \u039bt1 = \u03b70 e\u22122\u03b5\u03b11 \u039bt\nby integration. In this case, \u039b remains constant, thus, the propagation distance of a fixed\npoint of the soliton is calculated by x = \u039bt. As a result, we can write\n\u03b7 = \u03b70 e\u22122\u03b5\u03b11 x ,\nwhich recovers a well-known result in previous theories [1].\nSecondly, we give a brief study of the perturbation P [u] = \u2212i\u03b12 u\u2202 |u|2 /\u2202t accounting\nfor the Raman effect. Using Eq. (7), we derive Im(P ei\u03b8 ) = \u221232\u03b7 4 \u03b12 tanh zsech3 z, which has\ninfluence on the soliton's width and velocity. By Eq. (29), we get wt1 = \u22128\u03b12 (2\u03b7)6 w 3 /15,\nintegrating this equation yields\nw = w0 [1 +\n\n1\n16\n\u03b12 (2\u03b7)6w02 t1 ]\u2212 2 ,\n15\n\nwhich exhibits that the soliton is narrowed under this effect. As well, we can derive that\nthe velocity decreases, obeying\n\u039b = \u039b0 [1 +\n\n1\n16\n\u03b12 (2\u03b7)4\u039b20 t1 ]\u2212 2 .\n15\n\nUnder the picture of waveform, the width is depicted differently, and the velocity of dynamic\nsense can not be defined.\nIn conclusion, we think that the waveshape presents a more transparent picture of directly\nphysical significance than the waveform, especially in the study of soliton under perturbations. Hence, we believe that our theory is a nontrivial and necessary alternative for the\nsubject. Moreover, the mathematical development in this paper is distinct and normal, its\nidea is helpful for the study of other soliton problems as well.\nAcknowledgments.This work was support by the NNSF (No.19625409) and Nonlinear\nProject of the NSTC.\n\n9\n\n\fREFERENCES\n[1] G.
