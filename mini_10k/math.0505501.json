Key\nwords and phrases: Complete bounded minimal surfaces, proper minimal immersions.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction and background\n\nLast few years have seen an important progress on many long-standing problems in global theory of\ncomplete minimal surfaces in R3 . One of these has been the Calabi-Yau problem, which dates back to\nthe 1960s. Calabi asked wheter or not it is possible for a complete minimal surface in R3 to be contained\nin the ball B = {x \u2208 R3 | kxk < 1}. Much work has been done on it over the past four decades. The most\nimportant result in this line was obtained by N. Nadirashvili in [13] where he constructed a complete\nminimal surface in B. After Nadirashvili's negative solution to Calabi's question, the conjecture was\nrevisited by S.-T. Yau in [15], where he stated new questions related to the embeddedness and properness\nof surfaces of this type.\nRegarding the existence of complete embedded minimal surfaces in a ball, T. Colding and W. Minicozzi\n[1] have proved that a complete embedded minimal surface with finite topology in R3 must be properly\nembedded in R3 . In particular it cannot be contained in a ball. Very recently, Colding-Minicozzi result\nhas been generalized in two different directions. On one hand W. H. Meeks III, J. P\u00e9rez and A. Ros [9]\nhave proved that if M is a complete embedded minimal surface in R3 with finite genus and a countable\nnumber of ends, then M is properly embedded in R3 . On the other hand, Meeks and Rosenberg [12]\nhave obtained that if a complete embedded minimal surface M has injectivity radius IM > 0, then M is\nproper in space.\nConcerning properness, it is important to note that Nadirashvili's technique did not guarantee the\nimmersion was proper. In [5], F. Mart\u0131\u0301n and S. Morales introduced an additional ingredient into Nadirashvili's machinery in order to produce a complete minimal disk which is properly immersed in a ball\nof R3 . Recently [6], they improved on their original techniques and were able to show that every convex\ndomain (not necessarily bounded or smooth) admits a complete properly immersed minimal disk.\nThe present paper can be considered as a continuation of the above mentioned work developed by the\nauthors about the construction of complete proper minimal surfaces in (open) convex bodies of Euclidean\n\u2217 Research\n\npartially supported by MEC-FEDER Grant no. MTM2004 - 00160.\n\n1\n\n\fspace. After the discovering of those examples a natural question arose: What is the asymptotic behavior\nof such a surface ? If we consider a proper minimal immersion \u03c8 : D \u2192 C, where C is an open convex\ndef\nbody, then we define the limit set as \u03c8(\u2202D) = \u03c8(D) \u2212 \u03c8(D). It is obvious that \u03c8 is proper if, and only\nif, \u03c8(\u2202D) \u2282 \u2202C. Furthermore, one can easily check that \u03c8(D) is closed and connected. In this paper we\nshow:\nTheorem A. Let C be a regular strictly convex1 bounded domain of R3 , and consider a regular Jordan\ncurve \u0393 \u2282 \u2202C. Then, for each \u03b5 > 0, we obtain the existence of a complete proper minimal immersion\n\u03c8(\u0393,\u03b5) : D \u2192 C satisfying that the Hausdorff distance \u03b4 H (\u03c8(\u0393,\u03b5) (\u2202D), \u0393) < \u03b5, where \u03c8(\u0393,\u03b5) (\u2202D) represents\nthe limit set of the minimal disk \u03c8(\u0393,\u03b5) (D).\nThe main obstacle in the study of the asymptotic behavior of a complete proper minimal surface in\na convex domain is that all the methods of construction up until today are implicit. So, it was almost\nimpossible to obtain any control about the behavior of the known examples near their ends. From this\npoint of view, the new methods of construction introduced in this paper are significant. The main of\nthese tools is Theorem 1 whose proof is based on a Meeks' idea that appeared first in [6] but that has\nbeen entirely developed and exploited in this article.\nTheorem 1 represents by itself an interesting density result. It asserts that any minimal disk with\ne\nboundary D can be approximated (in terms of uniform convergence) by a complete minimal disk D.\ne\nMoreover, it is possible to find a thin tube around \u2202D such that the part of D which lies in the exterior\ne where the intrinsic metric exploits is contained in\nof this tube is compact. In other words, the part of D\nthe interior of this thin tube (see Figure 2.)\nThe other important ingredient in the proof of the main theorem is Lemma 2. This approximation\nlemma is crucial to obtain the properness in Theorem A and it was proved in [6]. It essentially asserts that\na minimal disk with boundary can be perturbed outside a compact set in such a way that the boundary\nof the resulting surface achieves the boundary of a prescribed convex domain. Hypothesis of C being\nstrictly convex is crucial at this point, otherwise we could not obtain an upper bound for the distances\nbetween the boundary of a minimal disk and the boundary of the deformed one.\nIt is natural to ask what is the limit of the complete proper minimal surfaces given by Theorem A\nas \u03b5 tends to 0. We would like to point out that the limit as \u03b5 goes to zero of \u03c8(\u0393,\u03b5) exists, but it is not\ncomplete. Actually, this limit coincides with the minimal disk (with boundary) spanned by the curve \u0393.\nTheorem A has some interesting consequences. We would like to point out two of them.\nTheorem B. Let C be a regular, strictly convex bounded domain, and consider a connected compact\nset K \u2282 \u2202C. Then, for each \u03b5 > 0, there exists a complete proper minimal immersion \u03c6(K,\u03b5) : D \u2192 C\nsatisfying that the Hausdorff distance \u03b4 H (\u03c8(K,\u03b5) (\u2202D), K) < \u03b5.\nThe above theorem follows from the fact that Jordan curves are dense in the space of compact sets\nof \u2202C with the Hausdorff metric. Among other things, Theorem B says to us that the limit set of a\ncomplete proper minimal surface can be very small. This means that we can work with small pieces of\nthe boundary of a given domain in orther to prove the following:\nTheorem C. Every bounded domain with regular boundary admits a complete properly immersed minimal\ndisk.\nIn contrast to these existence results for complete properly immersed minimal disks in bounded\ndomains, Meeks, Nadirashvili and the first author [4] have constructed domains of R3 which do not\ncontain any complete proper minimal surface with finite topology. It is our belief that these open domains\nare in fact universal according to the following definition: A connected region of space which is open or\nthe closure of an open set is universal for minimal surfaces, if every complete properly immersed minimal\nsurface in the region is recurrent for Brownian motions. In particular, a bounded domain is universal if\nand only if it contains no complete properly immersed minimal surfaces.\n1 strictly convex means that the principal curvatures of \u2202C associated to the inward pointing unit normal are positive\neverywhere.\n\n2\n\n\fFigure 1: Theorem C states that every bounded domain with regular boundary admits a complete\nproperly immersed minimal surface. Besides, the boundary limit set is close to a small simple closed\ncurve \u0393 on the positively curved part of the boundary of the domain.\nAs we mentioned before, Colding and Minicozzi proved that any complete embedded minimal surface\nin R3 with finite topology is properly embedded in R3 . By results of Meeks and Rosenberg, [10, 11], any\nproperly embedded minimal surface of finite topology in R3 is recurrent for Brownian motion. Hence,\nevery domain in R3 is universal for embedded minimal surfaces of finite topology. Finally, we remark\nthat Collin, Kusner, Meeks and Rosenberg [2] proved that any properly immersed minimal surface with\nboundary in a closed convex domain in R3 has full harmonic measure on its boundary.\nThe paper is displayed as follows. Section 2 is dedicated to state and demonstrate the preliminary\nresults that we need to obtain the main theorems. These main theorems are proved in Section 3 where we\nalso establish some results which show that Theorem A is sharp. Thus, at the end of Section 3 we show\nthat Theorem A is false if the boundary of the domain contains an open set where the mean curvature is\nnon positive.\n\n1.1\n\nMinimal surface background\n\nGiven X = (X1 , X2 , X3 ) : M \u2212\u2192 R3 a conformal minimal immersion we denote by g : M \u2212\u2192 C = C \u222a\n{\u221e} its stereographically projected Gauss map that is a meromorphic function and by \u03c63 the holomorphic\ndifferential defined as \u03c63 = dX3 + \u22c6 i dX3 , where \u22c6 denotes the Hodge operator on M . The pair (g, \u03c63 ) is\nusually referred to as the Weierstrass data of the minimal surface, and the minimal immersion X can be\nexpressed, up to translations, solely in terms of these data as\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013 \u0013\nZ z\u0012 \u0012\nZ z\n1 1\ni 1\n(\u03c61 , \u03c62 , \u03c63 ) = Re\nX = Re\n\u2212g ,\n+ g , 1 \u03c63 ,\n(1)\n2 g\n2 g\nwhere Re stands for real part and z is a conformal parameter on M . The pair (g, \u03c63 ) satisfies certain\ncompatibility conditions:\n\u03c621 + \u03c622 + \u03c623 = 0;\n(2)\nk\u03c61 k2 + k\u03c62 k2 + k\u03c63 k2 6= 0;\n\n(3)\n\nand all periods of the \u03c6j are purely imaginary; j = 1, 2, 3.\nConversely, if M is a Riemann surface, g : M \u2192 C is a meromorphic function and \u03c63 is a holomorphic\none-form on M fulfilling the conditions (2) and (3) then the map X : M \u2192 R3 given by (1) is a conformal\nminimal immersion with Weierstrass data (g, \u03c63 ).\nCondition ii) stated above deals with the independence of (1) on the integration path, and it is usually\ncalled the period problem. In this article, all the minimal immersions are defined on simply connected\n\n3\n\n\fdomains of C. Then, the Weierstrass 1-forms have no periods, and so the only requirements are (2) and\ndef\n\n(3). In this case, the differential \u03b7 = \u03c63 /g can be written as \u03b7 = f (z) dz. The metric of X can be\nexpressed as\n\u0001\n\u00012\nSX 2 = 12 k\u03c6k2 = 12 1 + |g|2 |f | |dz| .\n(4)\n\nThroughout the paper, we will use several orthonormal bases of R3 . Given S an orthonormal basis and\nv \u2208 R3 , let v(k,S) denote the k-th coordinate of v in S. The first two coordinates of v in this basis will be\n\u0001\nrepresented by v(\u2217,S) = v(1,S) , v(2,S) .\nGiven a curve \u03b1 in \u03a9, by l(\u03b1, X) we mean the length of \u03b1 with respect to the metric SX . Given a\nsubset W \u2282 \u03a9, we define:\n\u2022 dist(W,X) (p, q) = inf{l(\u03b1, SX ) | \u03b1 : [0, 1] \u2192 W, \u03b1(0) = p, \u03b1(1) = q}, for any p, q \u2208 W ;\n\u2022 dist(W,X) (T1 , T2 ) = inf{dist(W,SX ) (p, q) | p \u2208 T1 , q \u2208 T2 }, for any T1 , T2 \u2282 W ;\nThe Euclidean metric on C will be denoted as h*, *i. Note that SX 2 = \u03bb2X h*, *i, where the conformal\ncoefficient \u03bbX is given by (4).\nGiven a domain D \u2282 C, we will say that a function, or a 1-form, is harmonic, holomorphic, meromophic,... on D, if it is harmonic, holomorphic, meromorphic,... on a domain containing D.\nLet P be a simple closed polygonal curve in C. We let Int P denote the bounded connected component\nof C \u2212 P. We will assume that the origin is in the interior region of all the polygons that appears in the\npaper. Given \u03be > 0, small enough, we define P \u03be to be the parallel polygonal curve in Int P , satisfying\nthe property that the distance between parallel sides is equal to \u03be. Whenever we write P \u03be in the paper\nwe are assuming that \u03be is small enough to define the polygon properly.\n\n1.2\n\nBackground on convex bodies and Hausdorff distance\n\nGiven E a bounded regular convex domain of R3 and p \u2208 \u2202E, we will let \u03ba2 (p) \u2265 \u03ba1 (p) \u2265 0 denote the\nprincipal curvatures of \u2202E at p (associated to the inward pointing unit normal.) Moreover, we write:\ndef\n\ndef\n\n\u03ba1 (\u2202E) = min{\u03ba1 (p) : p \u2208 \u2202E},\n\n\u03ba2 (\u2202E) = max{\u03ba2 (p) : p \u2208 \u2202E}.\n\nIf we consider N : \u2202E \u2192 S2 the outward pointing unit normal or Gauss map of \u2202E, then there exists\na constant a > 0 (depending on E) such that \u2202Et = {p + t * N (p) : p \u2208 \u2202E} is a regular (convex)\nsurface \u2200t \u2208 [\u2212a, +\u221e[. Let Et denote the convex domain bounded by \u2202Et . The normal projection to E\nis represented as\nPE : R3 \\ E\u2212a \u2212\u2192 \u2202E,\n3\n\np + t * N (p) 7\u2192 p.\n\nFor a curve \u03a5 in R and a real r > 0, we define the tube of radius r along \u03a5 in the following way:\nT (\u03a5, r) = \u03a5 + B(0, r),\nwhere B(0, r) = {p \u2208 R3 : kpk < r}.\nThe set C n of convex bodies of Rn can be made into a metric space in several geometrically reasonable\nways. The Hausdorff metric is particularly convenient and applicable. The natural domain for this metric\nis the set Kn of the nonempty compact subsets of Rn .\nFor C, D \u2208 Kn the Hausdorff distance is defined by:\n\u001a\n\u001b\nH\n\u03b4 (C, D) = max sup inf kx \u2212 yk, sup inf kx \u2212 yk\nx\u2208C y\u2208D\n\ny\u2208D x\u2208C\n\nor, equivalently, by\n\u03b4 H (C, D) = min {\u03bb \u2265 0 | C \u2282 D + \u03bbBn , D \u2282 C + \u03bbBn } ,\n\nwhere Bn = {p \u2208 Rn | kpk < 1}. Then \u03b4 H is a metric on Kn , the Hausdorff metric. For more details we\nrefer to [14].\n\n4\n\n\f2\n\nPreliminary Lemmas\n\nAs we indicated in the introduction, the proofs of the main theorems of the paper require the technical\nresults of this section. To be more precise, the two principal tools are Theorem 1 and Lemma 2. Lemma\n3 is a suitable combination of the two previous results that allows us to prove Theorem 2. Regarding\nLemma 1, it is a necessary instrument in the demonstration of Theorem 1.\nLemma 1 (Completeness Lemma). Consider \u0393 a closed analytic curve. Let P be a polygon, X :\nInt P \u2192 R3 a conformal minimal immersion, and r, \u01eb positive constants satisfying:\n1. X(Int P \u2212 Int P \u01eb ) \u2282 T (\u0393, r);\n2.

Meeks III suggested to us in 2004. Roughly\nspeaking this theorem asserts that complete minimal disks are \"dense\" in the space of minimal disks with\nboundary.\n\nTheorem 1 (Meeks' trick). Let U \u2282 C be a bounded domain, and P \u2282 U a polygon. Consider\nX : U \u2192 R3 a conformal minimal immersion, with X(0) = 0. Then, for every \u03bc > 0 there exists a simply\nb : \u03a3 \u2192 R3 , with X(0)\nb\nconnected domain \u03a3 \u2282 C and a complete minimal immersion X\n= 0 such that:\n(b.1) Int P \u2282 \u03a3 \u2282 \u03a3 \u2282 U ;\n\nb\n(b.2) kX(z) \u2212 X(z)k\n< \u03bc, \u2200z \u2208 Int P ;\nb \u2212 Int P ) \u2282 T (X(P ), \u03bc);\n(b.3) X(\u03a3\n\nb ) is homologous to X(P ) in the open neighborhood T (X(P ), \u03bc).\n(b.4) X(P\n\nThe next lemma was obtained in [6] (see Lemma 1 and Remark 3). We have stated it here just to\nmake this paper self-contained. We would like to point out that the assumption of C being strictly convex\nis essential in this lemma, otherwise item (c.5) has no sense.\nLemma 2 (Properness Lemma, [6]). Let E and E \u2032 be two regular bounded strictly convex domains\nin R3 , with 0 \u2208 E \u2282 E \u2282 E \u2032 . Let X : O \u2212\u2192 R3 be a conformal minimal immersion defined on a simply\nconnected domain O, 0 \u2208 O, with X(0) = 0.

The proof of our main\nresult (Theorem 2) consists of constructing a sequence of minimal disks with boundary whose limit is the\nimmersion which proves the theorem. The sequence is defined in a recursive way and the tool to obtain\nan element of that sequence from the previous one in Lemma 3 below.\nLemma 3. Let \u0393 be a smooth Jordan curve of R3 and let \u03c1 > 0 be a sufficiently small constant so that\nthe tube T (\u0393, \u03c1) is homeomorphic to a solid torus. Let E and E \u2032 be two regular bounded strictly convex\ndomains in R3 , with 0 \u2208 E \u2282 E \u2282 E \u2032 . Consider P a polygon, X : Int P \u2212\u2192 R3 be a conformal minimal\nimmersion, with X(0) = 0, and \u03b5, a, b and c positive constants, such that:\n1.

As usual in constructions of this kind, our\nfirst step will consist of describing a labyrinth on Int P , which depends on P and a positive integer N .\nLet l be the number of sides of P . From now on, N will be a positive multiple of l.\nRemark 1. Throughout the proof of the lemma a set of real positive constants depending on X, P , r,\n\u01eb and s will appear. These constants will be represented by the symbol const. Notice that the choice of\nthese constants does not depend on the integer N .\nLet \u03b60 > 0 small enough so that P \u03b60 is well defined and Int(P \u01eb ) \u2282 Int(P \u03b60 ). From now on, we will\nonly consider N \u2208 N such that 2/N < \u03b60 . Let v1 , . . . , v2N be a set of points in the polygon P (containing\nthe vertices of P ) that divide each side of P into 2N\nl equal parts. We can transfer this partition to the\n\u2032\npolygon P 2/N : v1\u2032 , . . . , v2N\n. We define the following sets:\n\u2022 Li = the segment that joins vi and vi\u2032 , i = 1, . . . , 2N ;\n3\n\n\u2022 Pi = P i/N , i = 0, . . . , 2N 2 ;\nSN 2 \u22121\nSN 2\n\u2022 E = i=0 Int(P2i ) \u2212 Int(P2i+1 ) and Ee = i=1 Int(P2i\u22121 ) \u2212 Int(P2i );\n\n\u2022 R=\n\u2022 B=\n\nS2N 2\ni=0\n\nSN\n\ni=1\n\nPi ;\n\nSN \u22121\nL2i and Be = i=0 L2i+1 ;\n\ne = Be \u2229 E,\ne and H = R \u222a L \u222a L;\ne\n\u2022 L = B \u2229 E, L\n\n\u2022 \u039eN = {z \u2208 Int(P0 ) \u2212 Int(P2N 2 ) : distds0 ,C (z, H) \u2265\n\n1\n4N 3 },\n\nwhere ds0 is the Euclidean metric on C.\n\nWe define \u03c9i as the union of the segment Li and those connected components of \u039eN that have nonempty\nintersection with Li for i = 1, . . . , 2N . Finally, we label \u031fi = {z \u2208 C : distds0 ,C (z, \u03c9i ) < \u03b4(N )}, where\n\u03b4(N ) > 0 is chosen in such a way that the sets \u031fi (i = 1, . . . , 2N ) are pairwise disjoint.\nThe shape of the labyrinth formed by the sets \u03c9i , guarantee the following claims if N is large enough:\nClaim 2.1. The Euclidean diameter of \u031fi is less than\n\n7\n\nconst\nN .\n\n\fFigure 3: The set \u031fi and its image in R3 .\nClaim 2.2.

Assume we have constructed F0 , . . . , Fi\u22121 verifying Properties (A.1i ), . . ., (A.7i ). We define Fi as follows.\nFirst, observe that (for a large enough N) one has:\n(B.1) There are positive constants so that const1 \u2264 k\u03c6i\u22121 (z)k \u2264 const2 , for all z \u2208 Int P \u2212 \u222ai\u22121\nk=1 \u031fk ;\nTo obtain this property, it suffices to apply (A2j ) for j = 1, . . . , i \u2212 1.\n(B.2) The diameter in R3 of Fi\u22121 (\u031fi ) is less than \u221a1N .\nThis is a consequence of (B.1), Claim 3.1, and (4).\n(B.3) The diameter in S2 of Gi\u22121 (\u031fi ) is less than \u221a1N . In particular, the set Gi\u22121 (\u031fi ) can be included\n\u0011\n\u0010\nin a cone Cone g, \u221a1N , for a suitable g \u2208 Gi\u22121 (\u031fi ).\nFrom Claim 3.1, the diameter of G0 (\u031fi ) is bounded. Then (B.3) holds after successive applications\nof (A.5j ), j = 1, . . . , i \u2212 1.\n(B.4) There exists an orthogonal frame Si = {e1 , e2 , e3 } in R3 , where:\n(B.4.1) If z \u2208 \u031fi and kX(z) \u2212 pi k \u2265\n(B.4.2) \u2220(\u00b1e3 , Gi\u22121 (z)) \u2265\n\nconst\n\u221a\nN\n\n\u221a1 ,\nN\n\nthen \u2220 (e3 , X(z) \u2212 pi ) \u2264\n\nconst\n\u221a\n;\nN\n\nfor all z \u2208 \u031fi .\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\nThe proof of (B.4) is slightly more complicated. Let C = Cone g, \u221a2N where g is given by\nS\nProperty (B.3). To obtain (B.4.2) it suffices to take e3 in S2 \u2212 H, where H = C (\u2212C). On the\nother hand, in order to verify (B.4.1), the vector e3 must be chosen as follows:\n\u2022 If (S2 \\ H) \u2229 Ni (X(\u031fi ) \u2212 {pi })) 6= \u2205, then we take e3 \u2208 (S2 \\ H) \u2229 N (X(\u031fi ) \u2212 {pi });\n\n\u2022 If (S2 \\ H) \u2229 Ni (X(\u031fi ) \u2212 {pi }) = \u2205, then we take e3 \u2208 S2 \u2212 H satisfying \u2220(e3 , q \u2032 ) <\nsome q \u2032 \u2208 Ni (X(\u031fi ) \u2212 {pi }).\n\n\u221a2\nN\n\nfor\n\nIt is straightforward to check that this choice of e3 guarantees (B.4).\nAt this point we are able to construct the i-th element of our sequence Fi . Let (g i\u22121 , \u03c6i\u22121\n3 ) be the\nWeierstrass data of Fi\u22121 in the orthonormal basis Si . Applying Runge's theorem, we can construct a\nfamily of holomorphic functions, h\u03b1 : C \u2192 C\u2217 verifying:\n(a) |h\u03b1 (z) \u2212 1| <\n\n1\n\u03b1,\n\nfor all z \u2208 Int P \u2212 \u031fi ;\n\n(b) |h\u03b1 (z) \u2212 \u03b1| <\n\n1\n\u03b1,\n\nfor all z \u2208 \u03c9i ;\n\n9\n\n\fwhere \u03b1 \u2208 R+ . It is important to note that the family {h\u03b1 |Int P \u2212\u031fi | \u03b1 \u2208 R+ } is continuous in the\nparameter \u03b1.\nUsing h\u03b1 as a L\u00f3pez-Ros function, we define this new Weierstrass data:\ng (i,\u03b1)\n\n=\n\ng i\u22121\n,\nh\u03b1\n\n\u03c6i3 = \u03c6i\u22121\n3 ,\n\nand the associated conformal minimal immersion:\n\u0013 \u0013\n\u0012\nZ z\u0012\n1\n1\n1\n(i,\u03b1)\n(i,\u03b1)\nF(i,\u03b1) (z) = Re\n, 2 \u03c6i3 .\n\u2212g\n,i\n+g\n2\ng (i,\u03b1)\ng (i,\u03b1)\ndef\n\nNow, we have to check that there exists a real \u03b10 > 0 such that Fi = F(i,\u03b10 ) satisfies Properties (A.1i ),\n. . ., (A.7i ).\nSince h\u03b1 \u2192 1, uniformly on Int P \u2212 \u031fi , and h\u03b1 \u2192 \u221e, uniformly on \u03c9i , as \u03b1 \u2192 \u221e, then (A.1i ),\n(A.2i ), (A.3i ) and (A.6i ) trivially hold for any \u03b1 > \u03b10 , provided \u03b10 is large enough in terms of N .\nAs we mentioned before, the family {h\u03b1 |Int P \u2212\u031fi , \u03b1 \u2208 R+ } depends continuously on \u03b1, and h\u03b1 \u2192 1\nas \u03b1 \u2192 +\u221e, uniformly on Int P \u2212 \u031fi . As P \u01eb is contained in Int P \u2212 \u031fi , then we can see F(i,\u03b1) (P \u01eb ),\n\u03b1 \u2208 [\u03b10 , +\u221e], as a continuous deformation between F(i,\u03b10 ) (P \u01eb ) and Fi\u22121 (P \u01eb ). Furthermore, if N is large\nenough, Property (A.6i ) implies that F(i,\u03b1) (P \u01eb ) lies in the interior of T (\u0393, R), for all \u03b1 \u2208 [\u03b10 , +\u221e]. So,\nProperty (A.7i ) is a consequence of these facts and Property (A.7i\u22121 ).\nIn order to check (A.3i ) we have to use (B.4.2). This property gives us:\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0011\n\u0010\nconst\n\u221a\n\u221a\nsin\nsin const\n\u0010 N \u0011 \u2264 |g i\u22121 | \u2264\n\u0010N \u0011\nin \u031fi ,\nconst\nconst\n\u221a\n\u221a\n1 + cos\n1\n\u2212\ncos\nN\nN\nand so, taking (B.1) into account one has (if N is large enough):\nk\u03c6i k \u2265 |\u03c6i3 | = |\u03c6i\u22121\n3 |\u2265\n\n\u221a\n2k\u03c6i\u22121 k\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\n|g i\u22121 |\nconst\n\u221a\n\u2265\n\u2265\nconst\n*\nsin\nN\n1 + |g i\u22121 |2\n\nconst\n\u221a\nN\n\nin \u031fi .\n\nUsing (B.4.1), we get (A.5.1i ). Finally, to obtain (A.5.2i ), we use that \u03c6i\u22121\n= \u03c6i3 in the frame Si .\n3\n\nHence, we have constructed the immersions F0 , F1 , . . . , F2N verifying claims (A.1i ),. . .,(A.7i ) for i =\n1, . . . , 2N . The following proposition stands all the properties of F2N we will need.\nProposition 1. If N is sufficiently large, then we have:\n(I) dist(Int P ,F2N ) (P, P \u01eb ) > 2s;\n(II) kF2N (z) \u2212 X(z)k < const/N , for all z \u2208 Int P \u2212\n(III) There exists a polygon Pe in C such that:\n(III. a) Int P \u01eb \u2282 Int Pe \u2282 Int Pe \u2282 Int P ;\n\n(III. b) s < dist(Int P ,SF\n\n2N\n\n) (z, P\n\n\u01eb\n\n) < 2s, \u2200z \u2208 Pe ;\n\n(III. c) F2N (Int P \u2212 Int P \u01eb ) \u2282 T (\u0393, R);\n\n(IV) F2N (P \u01eb ) and \u0393 are homologous in T (\u0393, R).\n\n10\n\n2N\n[\n\ni=1\n\n\u031fi ;\n\n\fProof. Item (I) is an standard consequence of Claim 3.2, making use of (A.1i ), (A.2i ) and (A.3i ), i =\n1, . . . , 2N. Similarly, a successive application of (A.6i ) implies item (II).\nThe demonstration of item (III) is a bit more delicate. First we need to construct the polygon Pe\nin (III). To do this, we consider the set A = {z \u2208 Int P \u2212 Int P \u01eb : s < dist(Int P ,SF ) (z, P \u01eb ) < 2s}.\n2N\nNote that A is nonempty and that P and P \u01eb are in different connected components of C \u2212 A. Then, the\nexistence of the polygon Pe satisfying items (III.a) and (III.b) is obvious.\nNow, we are going to check that F2N verifies item (III.c). Consider \u03b7 \u2208 Int Pe \u2212 Int P \u01eb . We will assume\nthat F2N (\u03b7) 6\u2208 \u0393, otherwise we have nothing to prove. Hence, we distinguish two cases:\n2N\n[\n\u031fi .\nCase 1. The point \u03b7 belongs to Int P \u2212\ni=1\n\nIn this case we know that kF2N (\u03b7) \u2212 X(\u03b7)k \u2264 const\nN . Since X(\u03b7) lies in the interior of T (\u0393, r), then we\ncan choose N large enough so that F2N (\u03b7) \u2208 T (\u0393, r) \u2282 T (\u0393, R).\n\nCase 2. There exists i \u2208 {1, . . . , 2N } such that \u03b7 \u2208 \u031fi .\nConsider now a curve \u03b2 : [0, 1] \u2192 Int P so that \u03b2(0) \u2208 P \u01eb , \u03b2(1) = \u03b7 and l(\u03b2, F2N ) \u2264 2s. Note that the\nexistence of such a curve is guaranteed by (III.b). Let us define t = Supremum{t \u2208 [0, 1] : \u03b2(t) \u2208 \u2202\u031fi }\nand \u03b7 = \u03b2(t). It is important to note that t exists because \u031fi \u2282 Int P \u2212 Int P \u01eb .\nFor our purposes, we need to prove first the following inequality:\nkFi (\u03b7) \u2212 Fi (\u03b7)k \u2264\n\nconst\n+ 2s.\nN\n\n(7)\n\nIndeed, by using Properties (A.6k ), for k = 1, . . . , 2N , we obtain:\nkFi (\u03b7) \u2212 Fi (\u03b7)k \u2264 kFi (\u03b7) \u2212 F2N (\u03b7)k + kF2N (\u03b7) \u2212 F2N (\u03b7)k + kF2N (\u03b7) \u2212 Fi (\u03b7)k \u2264\nconst\nconst\nconst\n+ l(\u03b2, F2N ) +\n\u2264\n+ 2s.\nN\nN\nN\nLet pi be the point given by condition (6). Then we have:\nkF2N (\u03b7) \u2212 pi k \u2264 kFi (\u03b7) \u2212 pi k +\n\nconst\n.\nN\n\n(8)\n\nWe again distinguish two cases:\u221a\nCase 2.1. If kX(\u03b7) \u2212 pi k \u2264 1/ N , then one has:\nkFi (\u03b7)\u2212pi k \u2264 kFi (\u03b7)\u2212Fi (\u03b7)k+kFi (\u03b7)\u2212Fi\u22121 (\u03b7)k+kFi\u22121 (\u03b7)\u2212Fi\u22121 (\u03b7)k+kFi\u22121 (\u03b7)\u2212X(\u03b7)k+kX(\u03b7)\u2212pi k \u2264\nconst\nconst const const\n1\n+ \u221a\n+ 2s +\n+\n+\u221a \u2264R\nN\nN2\nN\nN\nN\nwhere the last inequality occurs if\u221aN is sufficiently large.\nCase 2.2. If kX(\u03b7) \u2212 pi k > 1/ N , then we use (A.5.2i ) to get a bound for the third coordinate of\nFi (\u03b7) \u2212 pi in the orthonormal basis Si . We proceed as follows:\n|(Fi (\u03b7) \u2212 pi )(3,Si ) | = |(Fi\u22121 (\u03b7) \u2212 pi )(3,Si ) | \u2264 |(Fi\u22121 (\u03b7) \u2212 X(\u03b7))(3,Si ) | + |(X(\u03b7) \u2212 pi)(3,Si ) | \u2264\n\nconst\n+ r.\nN\n(9)\n\nOn the other hand, we can apply Property (A.5.1i ) to find an upper bound for the first two coordinates\nof Fi (\u03b7) \u2212 pi ,\nk(Fi (\u03b7) \u2212 pi )(\u2217,Si ) k \u2264 k(Fi (\u03b7) \u2212 Fi (\u03b7))(\u2217,Si ) k + k(Fi (\u03b7) \u2212 Fi\u22121 (\u03b7))(\u2217,Si ) k+\nk(Fi\u22121 (\u03b7) \u2212 Fi (\u03b7))(\u2217,Si ) k + k(Fi\u22121 (\u03b7) \u2212 X(\u03b7))(\u2217,Si ) k + k(X(\u03b7) \u2212 pi )(\u2217,Si ) k \u2264\nconst\nconst\nconst\n1\nconst\n\u2264 2s + \u221a . (10)\n+\u221a + \u221a\n+ 2s +\n2\nN\nN\nN\nN\nN\n\n11\n\n\fBy Pythagoras' theorem and taking into account (9) and (10), we easily infer that:\ns\u0012\n\u00132\n\u00132 \u0012\nconst\nconst\n.\nkFi (\u03b7) \u2212 pi k <\n2s + \u221a\n+ r+\nN\nN\nUsing this upper bound, inequality (8) becomes:\ns\u0012\n\u00132 \u0012\n\u00132\nconst\nconst\nconst\nkF2N (\u03b7) \u2212 pi k \u2264\n+ r+\n.\n+\n2s + \u221a\nN\nN\nN\np\nSo, for a large enough N , it is clear that F2N (\u03b7) \u2208 T (\u0393, R) where R = r2 + (2s)2 + \u01eb, for all \u03b7 \u2208\nInt Pe \u2212 Int P \u01eb . This completes the proof of item (III.c).\nFinally, item (IV) in the proposition is a direct consequence of property (A.72N ).\n\ne we are looking for. Proposition 1\nObviously, the immersion F2N : Int Pe \u2192 R3 is the immersion X\ne\nsays to us that X so defined verifies items (a.1), . . ., (a.6) in the lemma.\n\n2.2\n\nProof of Theorem 1\n\nLet c0 > 0, r1 > 0 and \u03c11 > 0 to be specified later, and define\ns\n\u00132\n\u0012\nc0\n2c0\n2\n+ 2,\nrn = rn\u22121 +\nn\nn\nand \u03c1n = \u03c11 +\n\nPn\n\ni=2 c0 /i,\n\nn \u2265 2.

Our strategy consists of using Lemma 3 to define a sequence:\n\u03c7n = (Xn : Int Pn \u2192 R3 , Pn , \u03b5n , \u03ben ),\nwhere Xn is a conformal minimal immersion, Pn is a polygon, {\u03b5n }, {\u03ben } are decreasing sequences of non\nvanishing terms satisfying \u03b5n , \u03ben < c0 /n2 , and:\n\u03be\n\n\u03b5n\n\u03b5n\nn\u22121\n\u2282 Int Pn\u22121\n\u2282 Int Pn\u03ben \u2282 Int Pn\u03ben \u2282 Int Pn \u2282 Int Pn \u2282 Int Pn\u22121 ,\n\u2282 Int Pn\u22121\n(An ) Int Pn\u22121\n\n(Bn ) \u03c1n < dist\n\n(Xn ,Int Pn\u03ben )\n\n(0, Pn\u03ben ),\n\n\u03b5n\n(Cn ) kXn \u2212 Xn\u22121 k < \u03b5n in Int Pn\u22121\n,\n\u03be\n\nn\u22121\n, where {\u03b1i }i\u2208N is a sequence of real numbers such that 0 < \u03b1i < 1\n(Dn ) \u03bbXn \u2265Q\u03b1n \u03bbXn\u22121 in Int Pn\u22121\nn\nand { i=1 \u03b1i }n converges to 1/2,\n\n\u03b5n\n(En ) Xn (Pn\u22121\n) and \u0393 are homologous in T (\u0393, rn ),\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u03b5n\n\u2282 T (\u0393, rn ) .\n(Fn ) Xn Int Pn \u2212 Int Pn\u22121\n\n12\n\n\fThe choice of the first element of the sequence is not difficult. First, we take X1 = X. Let P1 be a polygon\nparallel\u0010to P and \u0011satisfying P1\u03be1 = P . The constant and the polygon must be chosen in such a way that\n\u03b4 H (X1 P1 \u2212 P1\u03be1 , \u0393) < r1 . Finally, we choose \u03c11 and \u03b51 satisfying:\n\nand \u03b51 < min{c0 , r1 }.\n\n\u03c11 < dist(X1 ,Int P1 ) (0, P1 )\n\nSuppose that we have defined \u03c71 , . . . , \u03c7n . Then, we will construct the (n + 1)-th term in the following\nway.\nc0\n3\ne\ne\nTake a sequence {b\n\u03b5m } \u0581 0, with \u03b5bm < (n+1)\n2 , \u2200m. For each m, we consider Pm and Ym : Int Pm \u2192 R\ngiven by Lemma 1, for the data:\nc0\n, \u03bd = \u03b5bm .\nX = Xn , P = Pn , r = rn , s =\nn+1\n\nIf m is large enough, items (a.1) and (a.2) in Lemma 1 tell us that Int Pn\u03ben \u2282 Int Pem and the sequence\n\n{Ym } converges to Xn uniformly in Int Pn\u03ben . In particular, {\u03bbYm } converges uniformly to \u03bbXn in Int Pn\u03ben .\nTherefore there is a m0 \u2208 N such that:\n\u03b5\u0302m0\n\nInt Pn\u03ben \u2282 Int Pn\n\u03c1n\n<\n\u2265\n\n\u03bbYm0\n\n\u2282 Int Pem0 ,\ndist\n\n(0, Pn\u03ben ),\n\n(13)\n(14)\n\nin Int Pn\u03ben .\n\n(15)\n\n(Ym0 ,Int Pn\u03ben )\n\n\u03b1n+1 \u03bbXn\n\nWe define Xn+1 = Ym0 , Pn+1 = Pem0 , and \u03b5n+1 = \u03b5bm0 . From (13), (14) and Item (a.3) in Lemma 1,\nit is not hard to see that \u03c1n+1 < dist(Xn+1 ,Int Pn+1 ) (0, Pn+1 ). Finally, take \u03ben+1 small enough such that\n(An+1 ) and (Bn+1 ) hold. The remaining properties directly follow from (13), (15) and the aforementioned\nlemma. This concludes the construction of the sequence {\u03c7n }n\u2208N .\nNow, we define\n!\n\u221e\n\u221e\n[\n[\n\u03b5n+1\n\u03ben\nInt(Pn ) .\n\u03a3=\nInt(Pn ) =\nn=1\n\nn=1\n\n\u03a3 is a simply connected domain in U .

It is clear that Xn (P ) is homologous to Xn (Pn\u22121\n)\nin T (\u0393, rn ), so using Property (En ) and taking into account our choice of \u0393 we conclude that Xn (P )\nand X(P ) are homologous in T (\u0393, rn ) \u2282 T (X(P ), \u03bc). Since the curves Xn (P ) converge uniformly\nb ) and all these curves have the same homological type as X(P ), then it is clear that X(P\nb )\nto X(P\nis also homologous to X(P ) in the tube T (X(P ), \u03bc).\n\nThis completes the proof of Theorem 1\n\n2.3\n\nProof of Lemma 3\n\nAll the arguments we need to prove this lemma are essentially contained in Theorem 1 and Lemma 2.\nFirst, we apply Theorem 1 to the immersion X : Int P \u2192 R3 , the polygon P \u03b5 and a constant \u03bc > 0, to\nb : \u03a3 \u2192 R3 which satisfies:\nbe determined later.

The former inclusion yields that\nb\n\u03b4 H (X(Int\n\u03a3 \u2212 Int P \u03b5 ), \u0393) < c. Indeed, we proceed by contradiction.

This completes the proof of Lemma 3.\n\n3\n\nProof of the main Theorems\n\nAt this point we are able to prove the principal results of our paper. From now on C will represent\na bounded, strictly convex regular domain of R3 . Recall that strictly convex means that the mean and\nGaussian curvatures are positive. If we call (K, \u03b4 H ) as the metric space of compact sets of \u2202C with the\nHausdorff distance, then we will prove that the limit sets of properly immersed minimal disk are dense\nin K. At the end of this section we will show that our results are sharp in the sense that neither strictly\nconvexity nor regularity can be removed from our assumptions.\nTheorem 2. Let C be a strictly convex bounded regular domain of space. For any smooth Jordan curve\n\u0393 \u2282 \u2202C and for any \u01eb > 0 there exists a complete proper minimal immersion \u03c8(\u0393,\u01eb) : D \u2192 C so that\n\u03b4 H (\u03c8(\u0393,\u01eb) (\u2202D), \u0393) < \u01eb.\nProof. We know that there is t0 > 0 so that Ct is well defined for any t \u2208] \u2212 t0 , \u221e[. Furthermore, the\nnormal projection Pt : R3 \u2212 Ct \u2192 \u2202(Ct ) is a well defined smooth map.\nWe fix \u03c4 > 0 such that \u03c4 < min{t0 , \u01eb}.

If we label \u03931 = P\u2212t1 (\u0393), it is\nobvious that \u03931 \u2282 \u2202E 1 is a Jordan curve.\nWe also take a decreasing sequence of positive reals {bn }n\u2208N , satisfying bn < c21 /n4 , \u2200n \u2208 N.\nFinally, we define a sequence of real numbers {\u03bcn }n\u2208N in the following way: \u03bc1 = \u03c4 /4 and \u03bcn =\n\u03bcn\u22121 + M (n, c1 ).\nThe next step consists of using Lemma 3 to construct (in a recursive way) a sequence\n\u03c7n = (Xn : Int Pn \u2192 R3 , Pn , \u03b5n , \u03ben ),\nwhere Xn are conformal minimal immersions with Xn (0) = 0, Pn are polygons,\nP\u221e and {\u03b5n }, {\u03ben }, {\u03c3n } are\nsequences of positive numbers converging to zero, verifying \u03b5k < c1 /k 2 , k=1 \u03b5k < \u03b4.

Let X1 : D \u2192 D1 be a\nconformal parametrization of the minimal disk D1 . Then we choose a polygon P1 \u2282 D sufficiently close\nto \u2202D and a constant \u03be1 > 0 so that:\n\u2022 \u03b4 H (X1 (Int P1 \u2212 Int P1\u03be1 ), \u03931 ) < b1 (< \u03c44 .) In particular, Properties (V1 ) and (VII1 ) hold.\n\u2022 X1 (P1 ) is homologous to \u0393 in the tube T (\u0393, \u03bc1 ).\nSuppose that we have \u03c71 , . . . , \u03c7n . In order to construct \u03c7n+1 , we consider the following data:\nE = En,\n\nE \u2032 = E n+1 ,\n\na = bn ,\n\nc = \u03bcn ,\n\nX = Xn ,\n\nP = Pn .\n\nProperty (Vn ) says to us that X(P ) \u2282 E \\ E\u2212a , and Property (VIIn ) says that \u03b4 H (X(P ), \u0393) < c.\nFurthermore, X(P ) is homologous to \u0393 in T (\u0393, c). Then it is straightforward that we can find a small\nenough positive constant \u03ba, such that Lemma 3 can be applied to the aforementioned data, and for any\n\u03b5 \u2208]0, \u03ba[.\n\n16\n\n\fc1\nTake a sequence {b\n\u03b5m } \u0581 0, with \u03b5bm < minimum{ (n+1)\n2 , \u03ba, bn+1 }, \u2200m. For each m, we consider Qm\n\nand Ym : Int Qm \u2192 R3 given by Lemma 3, for the above data and \u03b5 = b = \u03b5bm . It is important to note\nthat the constant M (a, b, \u03b5bm , E, E \u2032 ) in Lemma 3 is less that M (n + 1, c1 ).\n\nIf m is large enough, Assertions (b.1) and (b.5) in Lemma 3 tell us that Int Pn\u03ben \u2282 Int Qm and the\n\nsequence {Ym } converges to Xn uniformly in Int Pn\u03ben . In particular, {\u03bbYm } converges uniformly to \u03bbXn\n\nin Int Pn\u03ben . Therefore there is a m0 \u2208 N such that:\n\u03b5\u0302m0\n\nInt Pn\u03ben \u2282 Int Pn\n\u2265\n\u03bbYm0\n\n\u2282 Int Qm0 ,\n\u03b1n+1 \u03bbXn\n\nin\n\nInt Pn\u03ben .\n\n(18)\n(19)\n\nWe define Xn+1 = Ym0 , Pn+1 = Qm0 , and \u03b5n+1 = \u03b5bm0 . From (18) and Statement (d.2) in Lemma 3, we\n1\ninfer that \u03b5n+1\n< dist(Int Pn+1 ,Xn+1 ) (Pn\u03ben , Pn+1 ). Finally, take \u03ben+1 small enough such that (In+1 ) and\n(IVn+1 ) hold.\nThe remainder properties directly follow from (18), (19) and Lemma 3. This concludes the construction of the sequence {\u03c7n }n\u2208N .\n\nNow, we extract some information from the properties of {\u03c7n }. Actually, the limit of the sequence of\nminimal immersions will be the complete proper minimal immersion we are looking for.\nAt this point, we are able to define the immersion that proves the theorem. This immersion will be\nthe limit of the sequence {Xn }n\u2208N . But before of this, we need to construct the domain of definition of\nthe limit immersion. Properties (In ), n \u2208 N, imply that the set:\n\u03a9=\n\n\u221e\n[\n\nInt Pn\u03b5n+1 =\n\n\u221e\n[\n\nInt Pn\u03ben\n\nn=1\n\nn=1\n\nis an expansive union of simply connected domains, resulting in \u03a9 being simply connected. Moreover,\nas Int Pn\u03ben \u2282 D, then \u03a9 \u2282 D. Using Riemann's mapping Theorem, we deduce that \u03a9 is conformally\nequivalent to the unit disk.\nProperties (IIn ) say us that {Xn }n\u2208N is a Cauchy sequence, uniformly on compact sets of \u03a9, and so,\nby using Harnak's theorem, it converges. Let \u03c8(\u0393,\u01eb) : \u03a9 \u2192 R3 be the limit of {Xn }n\u2208N . Then \u03c8(\u0393,\u01eb) has\nthe following properties:\nClaim 3.1. \u03c8(\u0393,\u01eb) is a conformal minimal immersion.\nProof. The proof of this claim is a direct consequence of Properties (IIIn ), n \u2208 N.\nClaim 3.2. \u03c8(\u0393,\u01eb) : \u03a9 \u2212\u2192 C is proper.\nProof. Consider a compact subset K \u2282 C. Let n0 be a natural so that\nK \u2282 (E n\u22121 )\u22122(bn\u22121 +bn )\u2212P k\u2265n \u03b5k ,\n\n\u2200n \u2265 n0 .\n\n\u03b5n\nFrom Properties (VIn ), we have Xn (z) \u2208 R3 \u2212 (E n\u22121 )\u22122(bn\u22121 +bn ) , \u2200z \u2208 Int Pn \u2212 Int Pn\u22121\n. Moreover,\ntaking into account (IIk ), for k \u2265 n, we obtain\n\n\u03c8(\u0393,\u01eb) (z) \u2208 R3 \u2212 (E n\u22121 )\u22122(bn\u22121 +bn )\u2212P k\u2265n \u03b5k .\n\n\u03b5n\n\n\u03b5n\n\u22121\n\u22121\n0\nThen, we have \u03c8(\u0393,\u01eb)\n(K) \u2229 (Int Pn \u2212 Int Pn\u22121\n,\n) = \u2205 for n \u2265 n0 . This implies that \u03c8(\u0393,\u01eb)\n(K) \u2282 Int Pn0 \u22121\nand so it is compact in \u03a9.\n\nClaim 3.3. \u03a9 is complete with the metric S\u03c8(\u0393,\u01eb) .\nProof. This is a trivial consequence of Properties (IIn ) and (IVn ), n \u2208 N.\n17\n\n\fClaim 3.4. The limit set \u03c8(\u0393,\u01eb) (\u2202\u03a9) satifies \u03b4 H (\u03c8(\u0393,\u01eb) (\u2202\u03a9), \u0393) < \u01eb.\nProof. First, we are going to prove that distR3 (p, \u0393) < \u03c4 , for all p in the limit set \u03c8(\u0393,\u01eb) (\u2202\u03a9).\nGiven p \u2208 \u03c8(\u0393,\u01eb) (\u2202\u03a9), we know that there exists a sequence of points in \u03a9, {zn }n\u2208N , with\n{\u03c8(\u0393,\u01eb) (zn )}n\u2208N \u2192 p.\nWithout loss of generality (up to re-index the sequence and take a subsequence) we can assume:\nzn\nzn\n\n\u03b5n\n\u2208 Int Pn \u2212 Int Pn\u22121\n\n\u2208\n\n(20)\n\nInt Pn\u03b5n+1\n\n(21)\n\nFrom (20) and taking (VIIn ) into account we obtain:\ndistR3 (Xn (zn ), \u0393) \u2264 \u03bcn <\n\n\u03c4\n.\n2\n\n(22)\n\nOn the other hand, using (21) and the fact that zn satisfies the conditions to apply Properties (IIn ), for\nk \u2265 n + 1, then we have:\nk\u03c8(\u0393,\u01eb) (zn ) \u2212 Xn (zn )k \u2264\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nk=n+1\n\nkXk (zn ) \u2212 Xk\u22121 (zn )k <\n\n\u03c4\n.\n4\n\n(23)\n\nCombining (22) and (23) we trivially deduce that distR3 (\u03c8(\u0393,\u01eb) (zn ), \u0393) < 3\u03c4 /4. Finally, we take limit as\nn \u2192 \u221e and obtain distR3 (p, \u0393) \u2264 3\u03c4 /4 < \u01eb (recall that we have choosen \u03c4 < \u01eb.)\nNow, we have to prove that distR3 (x, \u03c8(\u0393,\u01eb) (\u2202\u03a9)) < \u03c4, for all x \u2208 \u0393.\nPick a point x \u2208 \u0393. Property (VIIn ) once again says to us:\n\u03b5n\n\u03b4 H (Xn (Int Pn \u2212 Int Pn\u22121\n), \u0393) \u2264 \u03bcn <\n\n\u03c4\n.\n2\n\n\u03b5n\n\u03b5n\nAssume that B(x, \u03c4 /2) \u2229 Xn (Pn\u22121\n) is empty. It implies that Xn (Pn\u22121\n) and \u0393 can not be homologous\n\u03b5n\nin T (\u0393, \u03c4 /2). But Properties (IXn ) and (VIIn ) imply that Xn (Pn\u22121 ) is homologous to \u0393 in T (\u0393, \u03bcn ) \u2282\nT (\u0393, \u03c4 /2), which is absurd.\n\u03b5n\nsuch that kXn (zn ) \u2212 xk < \u03c4 /2. Moreover, reasoning as\nHence, we deduce that there exists zn \u2208 Pn\u22121\nin (23), we have k\u03c8(\u0393,\u01eb) (zn ) \u2212 Xn (zn )k < \u03c4 /4. Then, we conclude\n\nk\u03c8(\u0393,\u01eb) (zn ) \u2212 xk < 3\u03c4 /4,\n\n\u2200n \u2208 N.\n\n(24)\n\nNotice that the sequence {\u03c8(\u0393,\u01eb) (zn )}n\u2208N admits a convergent subsequence (recall that C is compact).\nLet p denote the limit of such subsequence. Inequality (24) yields that kp \u2212 xk \u2264 3\u03c4 /4. In particular, we\nhave distR3 (x, \u03c8(\u0393,\u01eb) (\u2202\u03a9)) < \u01eb.\nThis completes the proof of Theorem 2.\nAs we mentioned in the introduction, the above theorem has the following direct application:\nTheorem 3. Every bounded domain with regular boundary admits a complete properly immersed minimal\ndisk.\nProof. If R is a bounded regular domain, then there exists an open connected region A \u2282 \u2202R so that the\nmean and Gauss curvatures are positive on A. Consider R\u2032 an strictly convex regular domain R\u2032 \u2282 R\nand such that \u2205 6= \u2202R\u2032 \u2229 \u2202R \u2282 A, like in Figure 4. Hence, in order to get the minimal immersion we are\nlooking for, it suffices to apply Theorem 2 to a Jordan curve \u0393 in \u2202R\u2032 \u2229 \u2202R and an \u03b5 > 0 small enough.\n\n18\n\n\fTheorem 3 implies that a bounded regular domain is not universal for minimal surfaces. A connected\nregion of space which is open or the closure of an open set is universal for minimal surfaces, if every complete properly immersed minimal surface in the region is recurrent for Brownian motions. In particular,\na bounded domain is universal if and only if it contains no complete properly immersed minimal surfaces.\nThe other interesting consequence follows from a well known result in convex geometry. Next theorem\nessentially asserts that the Jordan curve \u0393 can be substituted by an arbitrary compact set in the statement\nof Theorem 2.\nTheorem 4. Let C be an regular, strictly convex bounded domain, and consider a connected compact\nset K \u2282 \u2202C. Then, for each \u03b5 > 0, there exists a complete proper minimal immersion \u03c6(K,\u03b5) : D \u2192 C\nsatisfying that the Hausdorff distance \u03b4 H (\u03c8(K,\u03b5) (\u2202D), K) < \u03b5.\nTheorem 4 is a trivial consequence of Theorem 2 and the lemma below.\nLemma 4. Let K be a connected compact set in \u2202C, then for every \u03bd > 0 there exists an smooth Jordan\ncurve \u0393 so that \u03b4 H (K, \u0393) < \u03bd.\nProof. Classical results about Hausdorff metric says to us that there is a finite set F \u2282 K such that\n\u03b4 H (K, F ) < \u03bd/3. Label K \u2032 = (K + B(0, \u03bd/3)) \u2229 \u2202C, which is a connected open set in \u2202C. Then, it is clear\nthat we can find a compact simple piecewise smooth curve \u03b3 \u2032 in K \u2032 passing through all the points in F.\nIf \u03b3 \u2032 is not closed, we can consider a curve parallel to \u03b3 \u2032 , that we call \u03b3 \u2032\u2032 , and sufficiently close to \u03b3 \u2032 so\nthat the Jordan curve \u03b3 obtained joining the extremes of \u03b3 \u2032 and \u03b3 \u2032\u2032 satisfies \u03b4 H (\u03b3, K) < \u03bd/3. To finish,\nwe only need to approximate \u03b3 by a smooth Jordan curve satisfying \u03b4 H (\u03b3, \u0393) < \u03bd/3.\nFinally, we would like to show that our results are sharp in the following sense. If we remove from\nTheorem 2 the hypothesis of C being strictly convex, then the result fails. The most simple counterexample is open halfspace. If we consider a complete minimal disk properly immersed in an open halfspace\nthen the limit set cannot be bounded, if not we will arrive to a contradiction by the maximum principle.\nActually we can prove that:\nProposition 2. Let D a domain of R3 satisfying that there exists an open region U \u2282 \u2202D where the\nmean curvature associated to the inward pointing normal is non positive. If U is a graph over a bounded\nconvex domain of a plane, then there are no complete proper minimal disks in D whose limit set lies on\nU . In particular, Theorem 2 is not true for domains of this kind.\nProof. The proof of this proposition is an easy application of the maximum principle. We proceed by\ncontradiction. Assume there exists a complete proper minimal immersion \u03c8 : D \u2192 D so that the limit\nset \u03c8(\u2202D) is contained in U. From the hypotheses, we know that U is a graph over a plane \u03a0. First, we\n\nFigure 4: The domains R and R\u2032 and the curve \u0393.\n\n19\n\n\ftranslate U , orthogonally to \u03a0, and toward the interior of D until it does not touch \u03c8(D) (see Figure\n5.) Now continuously translate U toward \u03c8(D) until the translated graph intersects \u03c8(D) for the first\n\nFigure 5: We translate U in the direction of the interior of D until it does not touch \u03c8(D).\ntime. This must occur because the immersion is proper. As the limit set is contained in U , then \u03c8(D) is\ncontained in the interior of the convex cylinder over the projection of U in \u03a0. In particular the boundary\nof the graph never touches \u03c8(D), then the translated graph U0 and \u03c8(D) have an interior contact point,\nand so the maximum principle leads to U0 = \u03c8(D) which is absurd. This contradiction proves the\nproposition.\nOn the other hand, regularity is also necessary. Indeed, Mart\u0131\u0301n, Meeks and Nadirashvili [4] have\nrecently proved that:\nTheorem 5 ([4]). Let D be any bounded open domain in R3 . Then there exists a proper countable\ncollection F of pairwise disjoint horizontal simple closed curves in D such that the complementary domain\ne = D \u2212 F is universal for minimal surfaces with at least one annular end. In particular, any complete\nD\ne must have an uncountable number of ends.\nimmersed minimal surface of finite genus in D\nAmong other things, this means that Theorem 3 is sharp, too.\n\nReferences\n[1] T.
