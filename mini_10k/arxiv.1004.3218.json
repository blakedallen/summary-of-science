What makes this possible is the formal\nequivalence between the quantum mechanical Schr\u00f6dinger equation and the paraxial equation of diffraction. In this optical analogy the complex refractive index distribution plays\nthe role of the optical potential. The parity-time condition implies that the real index profile\nshould be even in the transverse direction while the loss or gain distribution must be odd.\nThus complex optical PT potentials can be realized by judiciously integrating an asymmetric gain or loss profile on an even index distribution [1]. In these studies it was shown\nthat optical PT symmetric materials can lead to behavior that is impossible in standard\nsystems. Such effects include double refraction, power oscillation, eigenfunction unfolding,\nnon-reciprocal diffraction patterns, bloch oscillations [1, 2, 4] to mention a few. Recently\nGuo et al [3] have demonstrated experimentally passive PT symmetry breaking within the\nrealm of optics. In ref.[10], the first observation of the behavior of a PT optical coupled\nsystem that involves a complex index potential is reported. Energy band formation [11\u201314]\nand spontaneous symmetry breaking thresholds have been investigated in a few PT symmetric models even in presence of nonlinearity [1] and lattice disorder [8]. In particular,\nwhile discussing energy bands due to a complex periodic potential, the authors of ref.[11]\nargued from the graphs of \u2206(E), E \u2208 R corresponding to these potentials, that some energy\nbands would appear and disappear under perturbations. Later it was shown that [14] the\nappearance and disappearance of such energy bands imply existence of non real spectra due\nto the complex deformation of real intervals.\nIn this short note we shall concentrate on the complex periodic potential\nV (x) = 4cos2 x + 4iV0 sin2x\n\n(0.1)\n\nwhere V (x + \u03c0) = V (x). This potential is invariant under the dual action of the space\nreflection operator P and the time reversal operator T [15]. In general the action of P is\ndefined by the relation p\u0302 \u2192 \u2212p\u0302, x\u0302 \u2192 \u2212x ( p\u0302, x\u0302 stand for momentum and position operators respectively) whereas that of the time operator T by p\u0302 \u2192 \u2212p\u0302, x\u0302 \u2192 x\u0302, i \u2192 \u2212i (for\nmore details on PT symmetry see [16] and references there). The reason for choosing this\nparticular potential (0.1) lies in the fact many physically interesting results [1, 2] have been\nobtained while considering this potential in optical lattice. In particular, in ref [2], by using\nspectral techniques and detailed numerical calculations the PT threshold V0th = 0.5 has\nbeen identified for this potential. It is found that below this threshold all the eigenvalues\nfor every band and every Bloch wave number are real and also all the forbidden gaps are\nopen whereas at the threshold V0th = 0.5, the spectrum is whole real line and there are no\nband gaps [17]. On the other hand, when V0 > 0.5 the first two bands (starting from the\n2\n\n\flowest band) start to merge together and in doing so they form oval-like structure with a\nrelated complex spectrum. The real as well as the imaginary parts of such a double valued\nband when V0 = 0.75 are depicted in Figure 2. We shall argue that one can anticipate by\nanalytical argument that when V0 < .5 the PT symmetry of the potential is unbroken. We\nshall also see that there is another critical point (V0c ) after which no part of the eigenvalues\nand the band structure remains real.\nLet us consider the following linear eigenvalue problem frequently used to study the linear\nproperties of a periodic potential in optical lattice [2]\nH\u03c8(x) =\n\nd2 \u03c8(x)\n+ V (x)\u03c8(x) = \u03b2\u03c8(x)\ndx2\n\n(0.2)\n\nwhere \u03b2 represents the propagation constant (energy eigenvalue) in the periodic structure\nand V (x) is given in (0.1) can be written as:\nq\n\uf8f1\n\u0001\n\u22121\n2\n\uf8f4\n2\n+\n2\n1\n\u2212\n4V\ncos\n2x\n\u2212\ni\ntanh\n2V\n,\nV0 < .5\n\uf8f4\n0\n0\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n2ix\nV0 = .5\nV (x) = 2 + 2eq ,\n(0.3)\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\uf8f4\n1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 2 + 2i 4V02 \u2212 1 sin 2x \u2212 i tanh\u22121\n,\nV0 > .5\n2V0\n\nRecently in ref [18, 19], it has been shown that the concept of PT symmetry has its roots\nin the theory of pseudo-Hermitian operators . The reality of the spectrum is ensured if the\nHamiltonian H is Hermitian with respect to a positive definite inner product hh\u03c81 |\u03c82 ii\u03b7 :=\nh\u03c81 |\u03b7|\u03c82 i, \u2200|\u03c81 i, |\u03c82 i \u2208 H [a Hilbert space in which H is acting], where the Hermitian linear\nautomorphism \u03b7 : H \u2192 H is positive definite. Consequently, \u03b7 pseudo-Hermiticity of the\nHamiltonian H is given by\nH \u2020 = \u03b7H\u03b7 \u22121\n(0.4)\nIt has also been shown that [20] for any PT symmetric Hamiltonian H having real\neigenvalues there exist an equivalent Hermitian Hamiltonian h by means of a similarity\n\u221a\ntransformation h = \u03c1H\u03c1\u22121 , where \u03c1 = \u03b7 is unitary [in the sense that it is Hermitian\nand for any pair of state vectors |\u03c8i, |\u03c6i : hh\u03c8|\u03c6ii\u03b7 = h\u03c8|\u03b7\u03c6i = h\u03c8|\u03c12 \u03c6i = h\u03c1\u03c8|\u03c1\u03c6i holds]\nwhich maps Hphys \u2192 H [Hphys being the Hilbert space equipped with the inner product\ndefined above]. The Hermitian Hamiltonian h is equivalent to H and that they have same\neigenvalues.\n\n3\n\n\fNow it is to be observed from (0.2) and (0.3) that\n(i) for V0 < 0.5 the Hamiltonian defined in (0.2) satisfy the relations1 H \u2020 = \u03b7H\u03b7 \u22121 and\np\n\u03b8\nd2\n1 \u2212 4V02 cos 2x, \u03c1 = e\u2212 2 p [is a unitary operator in the\nh = \u03c1H\u03c1\u22121 , where h \u2261 dx\n2 + 2 + 2\nsense stated earlier], \u03b7 = \u03c12 = e\u2212\u03b8p [is a positive definite operator2 ], \u03b8 = tanh\u22121 2V0 \u2208 R and\nd\np \u2261 \u2212i dx\n.\nHence the Hamiltonian H is \u03b7-pseudo-Hermitian with respect to a positive definite operator \u03b7 = e\u2212\u03b8p and the Hamiltonian is linked with that of a Hermitian Hamiltonian h via an\nimaginary shift of coordinate which indicates that all the eigenvalues of H are real and the\neigenvalue problem (0.2) reduces to solving the Mathieu equation as shown below.\n(ii) For V0 > .5 we have \u03b7V (x)\u03b7 \u22121 = V (x + i\u03b8) 6= V \u2217 (x), where \u03b7 = e\u2212\u03b8p , \u03b8 = tanh\u22121 2V10\nwhich indicates that in this case the Hamiltonian H is not \u03b7 pseudo-Hermitian so the reality\nof the eigenvalues is not ensured.\n(iii) For V0 = .5, the potential V (x) = 2 + 2e2ix had been studied in [11, 17, 22]. In\nref.[17], it was shown that the spectrum of this potential that is defined on the real line (x\nis real) is purely continuous and fills the semi axis [0, \u221e). There are no band gaps at all.\nThis is consistent with the results of ref.[22]. In the latter paper it was also shown that the\nspectrum of the Schrodinger Hamiltonian for the above mentioned potential can be discrete\nif one chooses the complex contour appropriately.\nHence it is clear that V0 = V0th = .5 is the transition point after which the eigenvalues of\nequation (0.2) becomes complex. This PT threshold V0th has been determined earlier in ref.\n[1, 2] using numerical techniques.\nAfter making the change of variable z = x \u2212 2i tanh\u22121 2V10 in case of V0 > .5, the equation\n(0.2) transforms into\n\u0012\n\u0013\nq\nd2 \u03c8(z; \u03b2, V0 )\n2\n+ 2 \u2212 \u03b2 + 2i 4V0 \u2212 1 sin2z \u03c8(z; \u03b2, V0 ) = 0.\n(0.5)\ndz 2\nUnder simple coordinate translation z \u2192 \u03c04 \u2212 z the equation (0.5) reduces to Mathieu\np\n2\nequation ddz\u03c82 +(a\u22122iqcos2z)\u03c8 = 0 [23], with characteristic value a = 2\u2212\u03b2 and q = 4V02 \u2212 1.\nA variety of numerical methods have been employed to solve Mathieu equation with an\nimaginary characteristic parameter as is the case in (0.5). Tabular values from an old paper\nof Mulholland and Goldstein [24] and Bouwkamp [25] reflect that the characteristic values\nq would be both real and conjugate complex: the transition occurring in the neighborhood\n1\n\n2\n\nIn ref.[21], it has been shown that the Hermitian linear automorphism \u03b7 = e\u2212\u03b8p affects an imaginary shift\nof the co-ordinate: e\u2212\u03b8p xe\u03b8p = x + i\u03b8.\n\u03b7 is square of a Hermitian operator, so it is positive.\n\n4\n\n\fof q = q0 = 1.46876852 for solution having a period \u03c0. The same critical(exceptional) point\nwas obtained in ref.[26], while considering the large N limit of the quasi exactly solvable\nPT symmetric potential V (x) = \u2212(i\u03besin2x + N)2 . So from equation (0.5) it follows that\nthere is a second critical point in the neighborhood of V0 = V0c \u223c .888437 after which all the\neigenvalues of the equation (0.5) becomes complex and occur in pairs as complex conjugates.\nConsequently no part of the band structure remain purely real. In the Figure 3 we have\nplotted the band structure for the value of V0 = .8885 using Floquet analysis [27].\nNow to determine the eigenvalues of the equation (0.5) and correspondingly the band\nstructure of the potential given in (0.1), we proceed as follows [28]. As the coefficient of the\neq.(0.5) are \u03c0 periodic, so according to Floquet-Bloch theorem [27] the eigenfunctions are\nof the form \u03c8(z; \u03b2, V0 ) = \u03c6\u03bd (z; \u03b2, V0 )ei\u03bdz , where \u03c6\u03bd (z + \u03c0) = \u03c6\u03bd (z) and \u03bd stands for the real\nBloch momentum. Since \u03c6\u03bd (z) is periodic so the entire solution of equation (0.5) can be\nexpanded in the Fourier series\nX\n\u03c8(z, \u03b2) =\nc2k (\u03bd; \u03b2, V0 )ei(\u03bd+2k)z\n(0.6)\nk\u2208Z\n\nwhich, inserted into eq.(0.5), gives the recurrence relation\np\n\u2212 4V02 \u2212 1\n, \u2200k \u2208 Z\nc2k + \u03b62k [c2(k\u22121) \u2212 c2(k+1) ] = 0, \u03b62k =\n[(\u03bd + 2k)2 + \u03b2 \u2212 2]\n\n(0.7)\n\nfor the coefficients c2k (\u03b2, \u03bd).

It has been also that\nfor V0 < .5 the eigenvalue problem (0.2) reduces to solving the Mathieu equation. With\nthe aid of \u03b7 pseudo-Hermiticity, the PT threshold for the potential under consideration, is\nobtained as V0th = .5. This was previously obtained in ref.[1, 2] using numerical technique.\n(ii) The existence of a second critical point V0c \u223c .888437 is established. Beyond this\ncritical value no part of the band structure remains real. Numerical calculations also support\nthis as is shown in Figure 3. At this point, it is important to note that in ref.[2], the authors\nhave shown that it is possible to find stationary self trapped modes (with real eigenvalues)\n2\nof the nonlinear equation ddx\u03c82 + V (x)\u03c8 + |\u03c8|2\u03c8 = \u03b2\u03c8 above the PT threshold V0th = .5.\nThis is because of the fact that the band structure still remains real for some values of\nbloch momentum \u03bd even above the PT threshold. Stability analysis however revealed that\nthe above class of lattice solitons are unstable. The possible physical implication of the\nsecond critical point V0c may be that there would not exist any soliton (neither stable nor\nunstable) solutions of the above nonlinear equation beyond V0c . It will be interesting to study\n6\n\n\fthis physical aspect and other related physical properties of the optical lattice beyond this\nsecond critical point V0c .\n\n[1] K. G. Makris et.al., Phys.
