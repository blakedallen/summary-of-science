The\nlatest addition to these materials are the so-called multiferroics which combine several ferroic orders like ferromagnetism, ferroelectricity, ferroelasticity etc [4\u20136].\nAmong them exist some compounds which combine electric and magnetic order exhibiting the magnetoelectric effect [4]. These alloys have several potential applications\nlike magnetic-field sensors and electric-write magneticread random-access memories [7\u201311]. Magnetic order and\nferroelectricity have different origins [12\u201314] and thus the\nmaterials exhibiting the magnetoelectric effect are few\nand the coupling between the magnetic and electric properties is weak. An alternative route to achieve a strong\ncoupling could be the growth of thin film heterostructures and several advances have been made towards the\nmagnetic control of ferroelectricity [15\u201317] and the electric control of thin film magnetism [18\u201320].\nAmong the most studied single-component multiferroic compounds are the bismuth ferrite and the bismuth\nmanganite, BiFeO3 and BiMnO3 . Bulk BiFeO3 crystallizes in a perovskite-like pseudocubic structure instead of\na ferrite one [21] and bulk BiMnO3 prefers a monoclinic\nlattice [22]. BiFeO3 is a ferroelectric G-type antiferromagnet [21] while BiMnO3 is a ferromagnet presenting\nno net spontaneous polarization [23, 24]. A Jahn-Teller\ndistortion corresponding to an elongation of the oxygen\noctahedron surrounding the Mn atom induces a polar order in BiMnO3 and G-type antiferromagnetism appears\nas in BiFeO3 ; this new multiferroic state is close in energy to the ferromagnetic non-polar ground state [23, 24].\nSeveral first-principles calculations have been carried out\nto study the properties of both bulk BiFeO3 [25] and\nBiMnO3 compounds [23, 24, 26]. We refer readers to\nRef. 27 for an overview of the literature on both compounds. Since the single-component crystals like BiFeO3\n\npresent only a weak magnetoelectric effect, an alternative\nroute to achieve a more strong effect has been proposed to\nbe the growth of heterostructures where epitaxial strain\ncan enhance the phenomenon [28\u201331]. Doping has been\nalso proposed to enhance the performance of such structures [32, 33]. Towards such heterostructures, multilayers\nconsisting of alternating layers of BiFeO3 and BiMnO3\nhave been proposed where the ferroelectricity of BiFeO3\ncouples to the ferromagnetic order in BiMnO3 through\nepitaxial strain and a nanoscale checkboard from firstprinciples has been recently proposed for several lattice\nstructures [27]. Simple doping of BiFeO3 with Mn leads\nto an antiferromagnetic coupling of the Mn spin moments\nto the Fe ones [34].\nIn a recent publication (Ref.\n35) we have presented extended first-principles calculations, employing the Quantum-ESPRESSO [36] ab-initio electronic\nstructure method in conjunction with the GeneralizedGradient Approximation (GGA) in the Perdew-BurkeErzenhof formulation [37], on the electronic and magnetic properties of BiFeO3 alloy as a function of the lattice constant in the case of the cubic perovskite structure\n(see figure 1 in Ref. 35), where the heavy cations (Bi)\noccupy the corners of the cube, oxygen atoms the center of the faces and the Fe atom is at the center of the\ncube. Fe atoms alone form a cubic cell and the considered 2\u00d72 unit cell in our calculations contained eight\nprimitive cells and thus eight Fe atoms. We studied four\npossible magnetic arrangements: one ferromagnetic (Ftype) and three antiferromagnetic (A-type, C-type and\nG-type). We found that all four types of magnetic order are close in energy and for a lattice constant of the\nprimitive cell larger than 3.888 \u00c5 the G-type antiferromagnetism becomes more stable than the ferromagnetic\nstate. The density of states (DOS) and the spin magnetic moments of the Fe atoms, which are responsible for\nthe magnetic properties, showed similar behavior in all\npossible magnetic states since magnetic interactions are\n\n\f2\n\nFe\nMn\n\nF\n\nI\n\nII\n\nA1\n\nIII\n\nA2\n1\n[0\n\nb)\n\n0]\n\nC1\n\nC2\n\nTABLE I: Absolute values of the atom-resolved spin magnetic\nmoments in \u03bcB for all cases and for all magnetic configurations under study. Results are for a lattice constant of the\nprimitive unit cell (see Fig. 1 in Ref. 35) of 14.7 a.u. (3.888\n\u00c5). In case III the A1 and A2 structures are equivalent due to\nsymmetry reasons and the same is valid also for the C1 and\nC2 configurations.\n\n[001]\n\na)\n\n[100]\n\nG\n\nFIG. 1: Fe and Mn atoms in Bi2 MnFeO6 form a cubic lattice. In (a) we present the three distributions of Mn and\nFe atoms which we considered and in (b) the possible magnetic configurations (vectors pointing up correspond to positive spin magnetic moments and vectors pointing down to\nnegative moments). Notice that there are now two possible\nA-type antiferromagnetic structures: (i) A1 where atoms belonging to neighboring planes along the [001] direction have\nantiparallel spin magnetic moments, and (ii) A2 when this occurs along the [100] directions. For the same reason there are\ntwo C-type antiferromagnetic configurations along the [110]\n(C1) and along the [101] (C2) directions.\n\nmediated by oxygen atoms. Bi atoms showed no contribution to magnetism while the magnetic properties of\nthe oxygen atoms depended strongly on their local environment since they are located at the midpoints between\nneighboring iron atoms.\nWe expand the study in Ref. 35 to cover also the case\nof Mn substitution for Fe in BiFeO3 motivated by the\nwork in Ref. 27 since the coexistence of Fe and Mn\ncations seems to lead to new multiferroic materials. We\nhave concentrated our interest on the electronic and magnetic properties of the resulting compounds employing\nthe same electronic structure method as in Ref. 35 and\ncalculations details are similar. We have chosen to study\na case with equal number of Fe and Mn atoms (denoted\nas Bi2 MnFeO6 ) using the same 2\u00d72 unit cell as in Ref.\n35. Thus now we have four Fe atoms and four Mn atoms\nper unit cell. There are several ways to distribute the\nFe and Mn atoms and in panel (a) of Fig. 1 we present\nthe three cases which we have considered. In the I-case\nwe have a layered structure consisting of alternating pure\nFe and pure Mn layers along the [001] direction. In the\nII-case we have alternating pure Fe and pure Mn layers\nalong the [110] direction and in III-case along the [111]\ndirection. In I-case each Fe(Mn) atom has four Fe(Mn)\nand two Mn(Fe) atom as nearest transition-metal neighbors while in II-case each Fe(Mn) atom has two Fe(Mn)\n\nBiFeO3 BiMnO3\nFe\nMn\nF\n2.98\n3.63\nA1\n3.26\n3.53\nA2\nC1\n3.53\n3.41\nC2\nG\n3.65\n3.24\n\nI-case\nFe Mn\n2.99 3.48\n3.24 3.49\n3.26 3.39\n3.57 3.32\n3.51 3.40\n3.68 3.22\n\nBi2 MnFeO6\nII-case\nFe Mn\n3.18 3.39\n3.37 3.27\n3.30 3.35\n3.51 3.37\n3.58 3.32\n3.68 3.21\n\nIII-case\nFe Mn\n3.31 3.22\n3.40 3.26\n3.40 3.26\n3.59 3.31\n3.59 3.31\n3.68 3.18\n\nand four Mn(Fe) atom as nearest transition-metal neighbors. In III-case each atom has six neighbors of the other\nchemical species. For our calculations we have used a lattice constant of 3.888 \u00c5 for the primitive unit cell in Fig.\n1 of Ref. 35 which is the calculated equilibrium lattice\nconstant for BiFeO3 in 35. Moreover due to the lower\nsymmetry there is for Bi2 MnFeO6 a larger number of\npossible magnetic configurations with respect to BiFeO3\nwhich are presented in panel (b) of Fig. 1. Arrows indicate the orientation of the spin magnetic moments of Fe\nand Mn atoms at the corners of the cube. F corresponds\nto the ferromagnetic configuration. There are two types\nof A-antiferromagnetism; in the A1-type all atoms within\na (001) layer are coupled ferromagnetically but successive\nlayers along the [001] direction are coupled antiferromagnetically between them while in the A2-type this concerns\nthe layers along the [100] direction. C1- and C2-types of\nantiferromagnetism describe antiferromagnetic coupling\nof successive layers along the [110] and [101] directions,\nrespectively. Finally G-type antiferromagnetism is characterized by alternation of the orientation of the spin\nmagnetic moments along the [111] direction. We should\nnote here that for the III-case of the distribution of Fe\nand Mn atoms, the symmetry is higher and the [001] and\n[100] directions are equivalent and the same stands also\nfor the [110] and [101] orientations. Thus for this case\nA1 and A2 as well as C1 and C2 are degenerate. In the\nnext section we present our calculated results. We have\nalso calculated the case of BiMnO3 similar to BiFeO3 in\nRef. 35 as reference and at the end of the next section\nwe also present shortly results for a smaller lattice constant of 3.703 \u00c5 corresponding to a contraction of the\nlattice of about 4.8 % . In the last section we conclude\nand summarize our results.\n\n\f3\n\nBiFeO3\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n3\n\nG-type\n\n0\n\n-3\n\nFe-t2g\n\nMn-t2g\n\nFe-d\n\nMn-d\n\n3\n\nDOS (states/eV)\n\nWe will start our discussion from the case of BiMnO3 .\nIn Table I we have gathered the spin magnetic moments\nin \u03bcB for the transition metal atoms for all cases under\nstudy and for a lattice constant of the primitive cell of\n3.888\u00c5. We have also included in the first column the\nvalues for BiFeO3 from Ref. 35. Note that for BiMnO3\nand BiFeO3 the A1 and A2 as well as the C1 and C2 antiferromagnetic configurations defined in Fig. 1 are degenerated. If we look at the spin magnetic moments Mn\nin BiMnO3 posses in general a very high spin magnetic\nmoment which reaches the 3.63 \u03bcB in the ferromagnetic\ncase and varies between 3.24 and 3.53 \u03bcB in the antiferromagnetic configurations comparable to the values for\nFe in BiFeO3 . The only noticeable difference for the two\nalloys concerns the ferromagnetic case (F-type) where Fe\nhas a spin moment of about 3 \u03bcB quite smaller than\nall other cases. Mn has one valence electron less than\nFe and thus in order to understand the behavior of its\nspin magnetic moment with respect to Fe we have to\nlook at the density of states (DOS) presented in Fig. 2\nfor Mn and Fe in BiMnO3 and BiFeO3 , respectively, for\nall four magnetic configurations under study. In the Fand A-configurations the large exchange splitting of the\nMn d-states pushes the minority bands slightly higher\nin energy with respect to Fe while for the latter part of\nthe extra electron occupies minority-spin states near the\nFermi level leading to smaller Fe spin magnetic moments\nwith respect to Mn. In the C- and G-configurations Mn\npresents a minority-spin pick pinned exactly at the Fermi\nlevel but this cannot explain the behavior of the spin\nmagnetic moments in these cases. In the same figure we\npresent with yellow shaded region the triple degenerated\nt2g states and thus the rest of the DOS corresponds to\nthe double degenerated eg states. The latter are higher\nin energy with respect to the t2g states due to the crystal field effect. The eg orbitals (dz2 and dx2 +y2 ) point\ntowards the neighboring oxygen atoms and thus energetically are unfavorable with respect to the t2g orbitals\n(dxy , dxz and dyz ) which point in the intermediate space,\nsince in the latter case the Coulomb repulsion with the\nelectrons occupying the oxygen p-orbitals is smaller. In\nthe minority-spin band of Mn the eg are not presented\nsince they are slightly over the upper bound of the energy axis. In the majority-spin band the eg states are\npartially occupied while for Fe the are completely occupied and thus Mn has a slightly smaller spin magnetic\nmoment for the C- and G- configurations. Finally we\nshould shortly discuss the other atoms in these two compounds. Bi atoms are heavy and their role is to yield the\nelectric polarization when the lattice is distorted while\ndue to symmetry their spin magnetic moment is almost\nzero and thus their contribution to the magnetic properties can be neglected.

The remaining contribution comes from the double-degenerated eg\nstates. Positive DOS values concern the majority-spin electrons and negative DOS values the minority-spin electrons.\nThe zero energy value corresponds to the Fermi level.\n\nRef. 35 for BiFeO3 are located at the midpoints between\nneighboring transition-metal atoms. If the two Fe atoms\nhad antiparallel moments the oxygen atom in the middle has a zero spin magnetic moment due to symmetry,\notherwise its spin moment was about 0.15 \u03bcB due to the\nhybridization between the O-p and Fe-t2g orbitals. Manganese t2g -orbitals hybridize with the oxygen p-orbitals\nmuch weaker and as a result oxygen atoms in BiMnO3 ,\nwhen both Mn neighboring atoms have parallel spin moments, exhibit spin magnetic moments of one order of\nmagnitude smaller than in BiFeO3 (the larger obtained\nvalue is about 0.03 \u03bcB in the ferromagnetic configuration). Thus in BiMnO3 the magnetic properties are entirely localized at the Mn sites.\nProbably the most interesting from the three cases of\npossible atomic distributions of Fe and Mn atoms presented in Fig. 1 is the I-case where we have along the\n\n\f4\n\nBi2MnFeO6 (I-case)\n3\n\nF\nG\n\nFe\n\n3\n\nMn\n\n0\n\n-3\n3\n\nDOS (states/eV)\n\nDOS (states/eV)\n\n0\n\n-3\n\nA1\nA2\n\n3\n\n0\n\n-3\n\ncase III\n\ncase II\n\n0\n\nFe\n\n-3\n\nA1\nC1\n\n3\n\nF\nG\n\n0\n\nC1\nC2\n\n3\n\nF\nG\n\n-3\n3\n\n0\n\ncase II\n\ncase III\n\n0\n\n-3\n-8\n\n-4\n\n0\n\n4\n\n-8\n\n-4\n\n0\n\n4\n\nEnergy-EF (eV)\n\nMn\n\n-3\n-8\n\n-4\n\nA1\nC1\n0\n\n4 -8\n\n-4\n\n0\n\n4\n\nEnergy-EF (eV)\n\nFIG. 3: (Color online) Fe and Mn d-resolved DOS for the\nI-case (see atoms distribution if Fig. 1) for all six magnetic\nconfigurations. Notice that in all cases the positive DOS values correspond to the majority states (e.g. in the A1 and A2\ncases the majority states are the spin-up for the Fe atoms and\nthe spin-down for the Mn atoms).\n\nFIG. 4: (Color online) Same as Fig. 3 for Fe (upper panel)\nand Mn (lower panel) in Bi2 MnFeO6 for the II and III cases\nof atoms distribution if Fig. 1.\n\n[001] directions successive layers of pure Fe and pure Mn\natoms. In Table I we have gathered the spin magnetic\nmoments for all magnetic configurations under study and\nin Fig. 3 the Fe- and Mn-resolved DOS. Note in each\nmagnetic configuration all Fe(Mn) atoms have the same\nmagnitude of the spin magnetic moment (only its orientation varies) and thus the same DOS shape. We present\nthe absolute value of the spin magnetic moments and\nin Fig. 3 the positive DOS values correspond to the\nmajority-spin electrons in order to make comparison between the various cases easier to follow. We will start our\ndiscussion from the spin magnetic moments presented\nin Table I. Our first remark is that both Fe and Mn\nspin moments are very close to their values in the parent BiFeO3 and BiMnO3 alloys, respectively. Moreover\nthe A1 and A2 as well as the C1 and C2 antiferromagnetic configurations correspond to almost identical spin\nmagnetic moments. Thus, as discussed in Ref. 35, we\ncan conclude that the oxygen atoms play a crucial role.\nAlthough themselves posses very small spin magnetic moments they bridge the transition-metal atoms and they\nmediate the magnetic interactions playing a shielding role\nfor the Fe and Mn atoms. Each Fe(Mn) atom has now 4\n\nFe(Mn) atoms as nearest transition-metal neighbors instead of 6 in the perfect alloys and the other two have\nbeen substituted by Mn(Fe) atoms. But this change in\nthe environment is screened by the intermediate oxygen atoms and the spin moments of the transition-metal\natoms are only marginally affected. This discussion ia\nalso reflected in the DOS presented in Fig. 3. For each\nmagnetic configuration the Fe- and Mn-resolved DOS are\nalmost identical to the ones for the parent BiFeO3 and\nBiMnO3 alloys in Fig. 2 and all the details shown in Fig.\n2 are present also in the DOS in Fig. 3; e.g. in both\nfigures Fe in the F-case presents a double pick structure in the minority-spin band and the Fermi level is\npinned exactly between these two picks while in the Gconfiguration there two distinct minority-spin picks corresponding to the t2g and eg states.\nFor the II- and III-cases of the Fe-Mn distribution we\ninclude the spin magnetic moments in Table I and the\nDOS in Fig. 4. We do not present the A2 and C2 cases\nin the figure since for the II-case they are similar to the\nA1 and C1 magnetic configurations while for the III-case\nas mentioned in the introduction we cannot distinguish\nbetween the A1(C1) and A2(C2) cases due to the symmetry of the lattice presented in Fig. 1. In II-case we\n\n\f5\nhave [001] chains of pure Fe and pure Mn or equivalently\nwe can describe the structure as successive layers of pure\nFe and pure Mn along the [110] direction. With respect\nto the I-case now each Fe(Mn) atom has only 2 nearestneighboring transition metal atoms of the same chemical\nspecies instead of 4. In the III-case, which can be envisaged as alternating layers of pure Fe and pure Mn\nalong the [111] direction all nearest neighbors are of the\nother chemical type, e.g. each Fe atom has 6 nearestneighboring Mn atoms. Thus although the magnetic interactions are mediated by the oxygen atoms the effect\non the spin magnetic moments is larger especially for the\nferromagnetic (F-type) alignment of the spin moments.\nAs the number of Mn neighbors increases the Fe spin\nmagnetic moment in the F-case increases from 2.99 \u03bcB\nin the I-case to 3.18 \u03bcB in the II-case and 3.31 \u03bcB in\nthe IIII-case. Simultaneously the Mn spin magnetic moment drops from 3.48 \u03bcB in the I-case to 3.22 \u03bcB in the\nIII-case. For the antiferromagnetic cases under study the\ninfluence on the spin magnetic moments is smaller and for\nthe G-type antiferromagnetism spin magnetic moments\nare unaltered by the variation of the Fe-Mn distribution.\nOverall even in the F-case the change in the magnitude\nof the spin magnetic moments is quite small; less than 0.3\n\u03bcB . The behavior of the spin magnetic moments is also\nreflected on the DOS presented in Fig. 4. In the II-case\nboth Fe- and Mn-resolved DOS for all magnetic configurations under study are similar to the I-case. In the III\ncase the only noticeable difference concerns Fe in the ferromagnetic case where the two picks at the Fermi level in\nthe minority-spin band have merged in one broad large\npick due to the influence of the exclusively Mn neighbors\nand this is also the only case where the variation of the\nspin-magnetic moment is noticeable reaching the 0.3 \u03bcB\nwith respect to the I-case.\nFinally, we have also studied the effect of a smaller\nlattice constant for the I-case and in Table II we present\nthe obtained results for a lattice constant of 3.703 \u00c5,\nwhich is about 4.8 % smaller than the 3.888 \u00c5 used in all\npreviously presented results. Already in Ref. 35 we had\nshown that contracting the lattice of BiFeO3 leads to an\nimportant decrease of the spin magnetic moment which\nin the G-type antiferromagnetism is less than 1 \u03bcB with\nrespect to the 3.65 \u03bcB in Table I for the larger lattice\nconstant. Also in the case of Mn in BiMnO3 the Mn\nspin magnetic moment decreases with the contraction of\nthe lattice although the decrease is not as dramatic as\nin BiFeO3 . This picture is also reflected in the layered\nI-case of Bi2 MnFeO6 which we studied. In the I-case the\nFe atoms keep a large number of Fe nearest-neighbors\nand its spin magnetic moment exhibits an even larger\ndecrease than in the case of BiFeO3 . Especially in the Gtype antifferomagnetism the Fe spin magnetic moments\nattend a low of only 0.25 \u03bcB being at the edge of being\nnon-magnetic. On the contrary Mn atoms keep a high\nvalue of their spin magnetic moment which exceeds the\n\nTABLE II: Same as Table I for a lattice constant of the primitive cell of 14 a.u.

First we have studied the BiMnO3\nalloy for various magnetic configurations and we have\nshown that, as was the case for BiFeO3 , Mn atoms exhibit\nhigh values of their spin magnetic moment, the magnitude of which exceeds the 3 \u03bcB in all cases under study.\nThe small difference between the Fe and Mn spin magnetic moments can be easily explained by the position of\nthe eg states with respect to the t2g states which lie lower\nin energy due to the crystal field effect. We took into account three different possible distributions for the Fe and\nMn atoms in Bi2 MnFeO6 and studied one ferromagnetic\nand five possible antiferromagnetic alignments of the spin\nmagnetic moments. Both Fe- and Mn-resolved magnetic\nand electronic properties are only marginal sensitive to\nthe various distributions of the atoms and show properties close to Fe and Mn atoms in the parent BiFeO3\nand BiMnO3 alloys, respectively. Also among the various magnetic configurations the spin moments show small\nvariation and their magnitude is always larger than 3\n\u03bcB . Thus oxygen atoms which are the nearest-neighbors\nof Fe(Mn) atoms play a crucial role since they mediate\nthe magnetic interactions between the transition metal\natoms and they screen any change in their environment.\nFinally we have shown that contracting the lattice leads\nto a large decrease in the spin magnetic moments of the\nFe atoms as in BiFeO3 studied in Ref. 35 while the Mn\natoms retain a large portion of their spin magnetic moment.\nAuthors acknowledge financial support from the K.\nKaratheodori program Nr.
