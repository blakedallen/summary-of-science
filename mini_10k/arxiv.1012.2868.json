Introduction\nAtmospheric and solar neutrino experiments have demonstrated that neutrinos have mass,\nP\nm\u03bd \u223c 0.05 eV [1].\nimplying a lower limit on the total neutrino mass given by M\u03bd \u2261\nThis is a clear indication that the standard model for particle physics is incomplete and\nthat there must be new physics beyond it. The neutrino mass splitting required to explain\nobservations of neutrino oscillations indicates that two hierarchies in the mass spectrum\nare possible: two light states and a heavy one (normal hierarchy, NH, with M\u03bd > 0.05 eV),\nor two heavy and one light (inverted hierarchy IH, with M\u03bd > 0.1 eV). A third possibility\nis that the absolute mass scale is much larger than the mass splittings and therefore the\nmass hierarchy does not matter (degenerate neutrino mass spectrum).\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n\fOn-going and forthcoming neutrino experiments aim at determining the parameters of\nthe neutrino mixing matrix and the nature of the neutrino mass (Dirac or Majorana). These\nexperiments are sensitive to neutrino flavor and mixing angle, and to the absolute mass\nscale for large neutrino masses. As an example, beta-decay end-point spectra are sensitive\nto the neutrino mass, regardless of whether neutrinos are Dirac or Majaorana particles,\nand, the current limit on the effective electron neutrino mass is < 2.2 eV, coming from\nthe Mainz and the Troitsk experiments, while KATRIN is expected to reach a sensitivity\nof \u223c 0.2 eV [2, 3, 4]. Near future neutrino oscillation data may resolve the neutrino mass\nhierarchy if one of the still unknown parameters, which relates flavor with mass states, is\nnot too small. However, if the mixing angle is too small, oscillation data may be unable to\nsolve this issue.\nOn the other hand cosmological probes are blind to flavor but sensitive to the absolute mass scale even for small neutrino masses (see Fig.1). In fact, a thermal neutrino\nrelic component in the Universe impacts both the expansion history and the growth of\nstructure. Neutrinos with mass <\n\u223c 1 eV become non-relativistic after the epoch of recombination probed by the CMB, and this mechanism allows massive neutrinos to alter\nthe matter-radiation equality for a fixed \u03a9m h2 . Neutrino's radiation-like behaviour at\nearly times changes the expansion rate, shifting the peak positions in the CMB angular power spectrum, but this is somewhat degenerate with other cosmological parameters. WMAP7 alone constrains M\u03bd < 1.3 eV [5] and, thanks to improved sensitivity to\npolarisation and to the angular power spectrum damping tail, forecasts for the Planck\nsatellite alone give M\u03bd \u223c 0.2 \u2212 0.4 eV, depending on the assumed cosmological model\nand fiducial neutrino mass (e.g., [8, 9] and references therein). Massive neutrinos mod1/2\nify structure formation on scales k > knr = 0.018(m\u03bd /1eV)1/2 \u03a9m h/Mpc, where knr\nis the wave-number corresponding to the Hubble horizon size at the epoch znr , when a\ngiven neutrino species becomes non-relativistic. In particular, neutrinos free-stream and\ndamp the galaxy power spectrum on scales k larger than the so called free-streaming scale\nkfs (z) = 0.82H(z)/(1 + z)2 (m\u03bd /1eV)hMpc\u22121 [1], thereby modifying the shape of the matter power spectrum in a redshift-dependent manner (see Fig. 2 and e.g. [10, 11, 12, 13]).\nTherefore, much more stringent constraints can be obtained by combining CMB data with\nlarge-scale structure (LSS) observations. Ref. [14, 15] showed that present data-sets yield\na robust upper limit of M\u03bd < 0.3 eV, almost ruling out the degenerate mass spectrum; this\nresult was later confirmed by [16, 17].\nThe forecasted sensitivity of future large-scale structure experiments, when combined\nwith Planck CMB priors, indicate that cosmology should soon be able to detect signatures\nof the cosmic neutrino background and determine the sum of neutrino masses (e.g. [18, 19,\n9, 20, 21] and references therein). Since cosmology is only weakly sensitive to the hierarchy\n[23], a total neutrino mass determination from cosmology will be able to determine the\nhierarchy only if the underlying model is normal hierarchy and M\u03bd < 0.1 eV (see e.g.\nFig. 1). A detection of the cosmic relic neutrino background (RNG) with cosmological\nexperiments1 would be a spectacular confirmation of our model for the early Universe\nand a window into one of the oldest relic components of our Universe besides the one\n1\n\nRecall that neutrino experiments are not sensitive to relic neutrinos, as current generation of exper-\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n\fFigure 1: Constraints from neutrino oscillations (shaded regions) and from cosmology. In this\nparametrisation the sign of the mass splitting specifies the hierarchy. The red triangles show the\nfiducial models explored in this work and the light blue vertical bands our forecasted errors (see\n\u00a75). For fiducial M\u03bd values below 0.1 eV a LCDM model must be assumed to obtain a detection\nwith > 2\u2013\u03c3 statistical significance. For higher fiducial M\u03bd , we can marginalise over dark energy\nparameters and still obtain tight errors on M\u03bd .\n\nrepresented by the stochastic gravitational wave background. This consideration prompts\nus to examine whether future galaxy redshift surveys probing LSS will be able to detect the\nsignature of the neutrino background and to determine the neutrino absolute mass scale.\nBeyond neutrino mass, cosmology is also sensitive to the number of neutrino species.\nIn the standard model for particle physics there are three neutrinos; they decouple early\nin the cosmic history and then contribute to the relativistic energy density (i.e. as if they\nwere radiation) with an effective number of neutrino species Neff = 3.046 (e.g. [1]) until\nthey become non-relativistic. Cosmology is sensitive to the physical energy density of\nrelativistic particles, which include photons and neutrinos: \u03a9r = \u03a9\u03b3 + Neff \u03a9\u03bd , where \u03a9\u03b3\nand \u03a9\u03bd are the energy density in photons and in one active neutrino species, respectively.\nCMB observations have constrained exquisitely well \u03a9\u03b3 , thus constraints in \u03a9r can be used\nto study neutrino properties. Deviations from Neff = 3.046 would indicate non-standard\niments do not have sufficient energy resolution to cleanly pin down the signature of the RNG. Anyway,\nthe beta-decay end-point spectrum is in principle also sensitive to the RNG, and this can be foreseen as a\nplausible perspective for future experiments only if neutrinos have masses of order eV, thus in the so called\ndegenerate scheme for neutrino masses, which is still allowed by all present data, though slightly disfavored\nby cosmological observations [22].\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\n\fneutrino properties or additional effective relativistic species. While the motivation for\nconsidering deviations from the standard model in the form of extra neutrino species has\nnow disappeared [25, 26, 27], departures from the standard Neff value could arise from decay\nof dark-matter particles [28, 29, 30, 31], early quintessence [32], or more exotic models [33].\nRelativistic particles affect the CMB and the matter power spectrum in two ways:\na) through their anisotropic stress [34, 5], and b) through their relativistic energy density which alters the epoch of matter radiation equality. The ratio of CMB peak heights\nconstrains matter-radiation equality yielding a degeneracy between Neff and \u03a9m h2 . This\ndegeneracy can be lifted by adding either cosmic expansion history data [35, 36, 37] or\nadding the large-scale shape of the matter power spectrum: the power spectrum turnover\nscale is also related to matter-radiation equality given by the parameter \u0393 \u223c \u03a9m h (note\nthe different scaling with h compared to the CMB constraint). LSS surveys can yield a\nmeasurement, at the same time, of both the cosmic expansion history (via the Baryon\nAcoustic Oscillations (BAO) signal), and the large scale turnover of the power spectrum.\nPresent constraints are already competitive with nucleosynthesis constraints, and future\ndata will offer the possibility to test consistency of the standard paradigm for the early\nUniverse. In fact, nucleosynthesis constraints rely on physics describing the Universe when\nits energy scale was T \u223c MeV, while cosmological constraints rely on physics at T \u223c eV .\nIn this paper we forecast errors on the total neutrino mass M\u03bd and the effective number\nof relativistic species Neff by combining Planck priors with data from future space-based\ngalaxy redshift surveys in the near-IR. In particular, we consider two main survey strategies:\n\u2022 The first approach is to use \"multi-slit\" spectroscopy aimed at observing a pure\nmagnitude-limited sample of galaxies selected in the near-IR (e.g. in the H-band at\n1.6 \u03bcm) with a limiting magnitude appropriate to cover the desired redshift range.\nExamples of this approach are given by instruments where the efficient multi-slit\ncapability is provided by micro-shutter arrays (MSA) (e.g. JEDI2 [38, 39, 40]), or\nby digital micromirror devices (DMD) (e.g. SPACE [41] and possibly WFIRST3 in\nthe future). With the multi-slit approach, all galaxy types (from passive ellipticals\nto starbursts) are observed, typically at 0 < z < 2 \u2212 3, if the observations are\ndone in the near-IR, and provided that the targets are randomly selected from the\nmagnitude-limited galaxy sample.\n\u2022 The second approach is based on slitless spectroscopy (e.g. Euclid4 and JDEM5\n[42, 43, 44]) which, due to stronger sky background, is sensitive mostly to galaxies\nwith emission lines (i.e. star-forming and AGN systems), and uses mainly H\u03b1 as a\nredshift tracer if the observations are done in the near-IR to cover the redshift range\n0.5 < z < 2.\n2\n\nhttp://jedi.nhn.ou.edu/\nhttp://wfirst.gsfc.nasa.gov/\n4\nhttp://sci.esa.int/euclid\n5\nhttp://jdem.gsfc.nasa.gov/\n3\n\n\u20134\u2013\n\n\fForthcoming surveys will also have a weak gravitational lensing component, which will\nalso be used to constrain neutrino properties (see e.g. [9]). Here we concentrate on galaxy\nclustering as an independent and complementary probe.\nThe rest of the paper is organised as follows. In \u00a7 2 we review our method and the\nemployed modelling. In \u00a7 3 we report the characteristics of the galaxy surveys considered\nin this work, and in \u00a7 4 we describe the adopted fiducial models and the explored space\nof cosmological parameters. In \u00a7 5 we present our results on the forecasted errors on the\nneutrino mass and number of neutrino species, and final in \u00a7 6 we draw our conclusions.\n\n2. Fisher matrix approach: P (k)\u2013method\nIn this paper we adopt the Fisher matrix formalism to make predictions on neutrino masses\nand relativistic degrees of freedom from future galaxy redshift surveys.\nThe Fisher matrix is defined as the second derivative of the natural logarithm of the\nlikelihood surface about the maximum. In the approximation that the posterior distribution\nfor the parameters is a multivariate Gaussian6 with mean \u03bc \u2261 hxi and covariance matrix\nC \u2261 hxxt i \u2212 \u03bc\u03bct , its elements are given by [45, 46, 47, 48]\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\n\u2202C \u22121 \u2202C\n\u2202\u03bc t \u22121 \u2202\u03bc\nFij = Tr C\u22121\nC\n.\n(2.1)\n+\nC\n2\n\u2202\u03b8i\n\u2202\u03b8j\n\u2202\u03b8i\n\u2202\u03b8j\nwhere x is a N-dimensional vector representing the data set, whose components xi are\nthe fluctuations in the galaxy density relative to the mean in N disjoint cells that cover\nthe three-dimensional survey volume in a fine grid. The {\u03b8i } denote the cosmological\nparameters within the assumed fiducial cosmology.\nIn order to explore the cosmological parameter constraints from a given redshift survey,\nwe need to specify the measurement uncertainties of the galaxy power spectrum. In general,\nthe statistical error on the measurement of the galaxy power spectrum Pg (k) at a given\nwave-number bin is [49]\n\u0015\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0014\n2(2\u03c0)2\n1 2\n\u2206Pg 2\n=\n,\n(2.2)\n1\n+\nPg\nVsurvey k2 \u2206k\u2206\u03bc\nng Pg\nwhere ng is the mean number density of galaxies, Vsurvey is the comoving survey volume of\nthe galaxy survey, and \u03bc is the cosine of the angle between k and the line-of-sight direction\n\u03bc = ~k * r\u0302/k.\nIn general, the observed galaxy power spectrum is different from the true spectrum, and\nit can be reconstructed approximately assuming a reference cosmology (which we consider\nto be our fiducial cosmology) as (e.g. [50])\nPobs (kref\u22a5 , krefk , z) =\n\nDA (z)2ref H(z)\nPg (kref\u22a5 , krefk , z) + Pshot ,\nDA (z)2 H(z)ref\n\n6\n\n(2.3)\n\nIn practice, it can happen that the choice of parametrisation makes the posterior distribution slightly\nnon-Gaussian. However, for the parametrisation chosen here, the error introduced by assuming Gaussianity\nin the posterior distribution can be considered as reasonably small, and therefore the Fisher matrix approach\nstill holds as an excellent approximation for parameter forecasts.\n\n\u20135\u2013\n\n\fwhere\n2\n\nPg (kref\u22a5 , krefk , z) = b(z)\n\n\"\n\n1 + \u03b2(z, k)\n\n2\nkrefk\n2\n2\nkref\n\u22a5 + krefk\n\n#2\n\n\u00d7 Pmatter (k, z) .\n\n(2.4)\n\nIn Eq. (2.3), H(z) and DA (z) are the Hubble parameter and the angular diameter distance,\nrespectively, and the prefactor (DA (z)2ref H(z))/(DA (z)2 H(z)ref ) encapsulates the geometrical distortions due to the Alcock-Paczynski effect [50, 51]. Their values in the reference\ncosmology are distinguished by the subscript 'ref', while those in the true cosmology have\nno subscript. k\u22a5 and kk are the wave-numbers across and along the line of sight in the\ntrue cosmology, and they are related to the wave-numbers calculated assuming the reference cosmology by kref\u22a5 = k\u22a5 DA (z)/DA (z)ref and krefk = kk H(z)ref /H(z). Pshot is the\nunknown white shot noise that remains even after the conventional shot noise of inverse\nnumber density has been subtracted [50], and which could arise from galaxy clustering bias\neven on large scales due to local bias [52]. In Eq. (2.4), b(z) is the linear bias factor between\ngalaxy and matter density distributions, and \u03b2(z, k) = fg (z, k)/b(z) is the linear redshiftspace distortion parameter [53], which in the presence of massive neutrinos depends on\nboth redshift and wave-numbers, since in this case the linear growth rate fg (z, k) is scale\ndependent even at the linear level. We estimate fg (z, k) using the fitting formula of Ref. [11]\n(see the bottom-right panel of Fig. 2). For the linear matter power spectrum Pmatter (k, z),\nwe can encapsulate the effect of massive neutrino free-streaming into a redshift dependent\ntotal matter linear transfer function T (k, z) [54, 55, 56], so that Pmatter (k, z) in Eq. (2.3)\ntakes the form\n\u0014\n\u00152 \u0012 \u0013n s\nG(z)\nk\n8\u03c0 2 c4 k0 \u22062R (k0 ) 2\n2 2 2\nT (k, z)\n(2.5)\ne\u2212k \u03bc \u03c3r ,\nPmatter (k, z) =\n4\n2\nG(z = 0)\nk0\n25H0 \u03a9m\nwhere G(z) is the usual scale independent linear growth-factor in the absence of massive\nneutrino free-streaming, i.e. for k \u2192 0 (see Eq. (25) in Ref. [56]), whose fiducial value in\neach redshift bin is computed through numerical integration of the differential equations\ngoverning the growth of linear perturbations in the presence of dark-energy [57]. The\nredshift-dependent linear transfer function T (k, z) depends on matter, baryon and massive\nneutrino densities (neglecting dark-energy at early times), and is computed in each redshift\nbin using CAMB7 [58]. As an example of its redshift dependence, in the top-left panel of\nFig. 2 we consider the linear transfer function and show the ratio T (k, z)/T (k, z = 0)\ncomputed with CAMB at redshifts z = 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2 for a total neutrino mass M\u03bd = 0.3 eV.\nOn the other hand, in the top-right panel of Fig. 2, as an example of the neutrino freestreaming effect, we fix the redshift at z = 0 and compute, for different neutrino masses,\nthe ratio of the linear transfer function to the linear transfer function in absence of massive\nneutrinos. The power suppression due to neutrino free-streaming is evident and increases\nwith the neutrino mass as well as the free-streaming scale. This suppression is also slightly\ndependent on the assumed mass hierarchy, as the blue-dotted and red-dashed lines clearly\nshow.\n7\n\nhttp://camb.info/\n\n\u20136\u2013\n\n\fFigure 2: Top Left: Ratio T (k, z)/T (k, z = 0) of the linear transfer functions computed with\nCAMB at redshifts z = 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, for a fiducial cosmology with a total neutrino mass M\u03bd = 0.3\neV and a degenerate mass spectrum.

Note that \u03bc(k, f\u03bd , \u03a9de ) represents the scale dependent correction to fg (z),\nevaluated at M\u03bd = 0.05.\n2 2 2\n\nIn Eq. (2.5) we have added the damping factor e\u2212k \u03bc \u03c3r , due to redshift uncertainties,\nwhere \u03c3r = (\u2202r/\u2202z)\u03c3z , r(z) being the comoving distance [59, 50], and we have assumed\nthe power spectrum of primordial curvature perturbations, PR (k), to be\n\u0012 \u0013n s\nk\nk3 PR (k)\n2\n=\n\u2206\n(k\n)\n,\n(2.6)\n\u22062R (k) \u2261\nR 0\n2\u03c0 2\nk0\nwhere k0 = 0.002/Mpc, \u22062R (k0 )|fid = 2.45 \u00d7 10\u22129 is the dimensionless amplitude of the\nprimordial curvature perturbations evaluated at a pivot scale k0 , and ns is the scalar\nspectral index [60].\nWith the aim to make forecasts on the ability of future redshift galaxy surveys to\nconstrain neutrino features, adopting different spectroscopic approaches (as discussed in\n\u00a73), in this work we consider separately the effect on Pobs of the total neutrino mass M\u03bd\n\n\u20137\u2013\n\n\fand the number of relativistic degrees of freedom Neff , exploiting information from both\nthe galaxy power spectrum shape and BAO distance indicators. In \u00a75.6 we will analyse also\nthe impact on neutrino mass constraints due to the inclusion of both growth\u2013information\nand a Gaussian damping due to random peculiar velocities.\nIn each redshift shell, with size \u2206z = 0.1 and centred at redshift zi , we choose the\nfollowing set of parameters to describe Pobs (kref\u22a5 , krefk , z):\n\b\ni\n, \u03c9m , \u03c9b , \u03b6, ns , h ,\n(2.7)\nH(zi ), DA (zi ), \u1e20(zi ), \u03b2(zi , k), Pshot\n\nwhere \u03b6 = Neff or \u03b6 = \u03c9\u03bd \u2261 \u03a9\u03bd h2 (depending on the assumed fiducial cosmology, see \u00a74),\n\u03c9m = \u03a9m h2 , \u03c9b = \u03a9b h2 , where h is given by H0 = 100h km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 , H0 being the Hubble constant. \u03a9m , \u03a9\u03bd = M\u03bd /(h2 93.8)eV, and \u03a9b are respectively the total matter, massive\nneutrino, and baryon present-day energy densities, in units of the critical energy density\nof the Universe. Finally, since G(z), b(z), and the power spectrum normalisation P0 are\ncompletely degenerate, we have introduced the quantity \u1e20(zi ) = (P0 )0.5 b(zi )G(zi )/G(z0 )\n[61].\nIn the limit where the survey volume is much larger than the scale of any features\nin Pobs (k), it has been shown [62] that it is possible to redefine xn to be not the density\nfluctuation in the nth spatial volume element, but the average power measured with the\nFKP method [49] in a thin shell of radius kn in Fourier space. Under these assumptions\nthe redshift survey Fisher matrix can be approximated as [46, 62]\nFijLSS =\n=\n\nZ\n\n~kmax\n\n\u2202 ln Pobs (~k) \u2202 ln Pobs (~k)\nd~k\nVeff (~k)\n\u2202pi\n\u2202pj\n2(2\u03c0)3\n\n~kmin\nZ 1 Z kmax\n\u22121\n\nkmin\n\n(2.8)\n\n\u2202 ln Pobs (k, \u03bc) \u2202 ln Pobs (k, \u03bc)\n2\u03c0k2 dkd\u03bc\nVeff (k, \u03bc)\n\u2202pi\n\u2202pj\n2(2\u03c0)3\n\nwhere the derivatives are evaluated at the parameter values pi of the fiducial model, and\nVeff is the effective volume of the survey:\n\u00152\n\u0014\nng Pg (k, \u03bc)\nVsurvey ,\n(2.9)\nVeff (k, \u03bc) =\nng Pg (k, \u03bc) + 1\nwhere we have assumed that the comoving number density ng is constant in position.\nDue to azimuthal symmetry around the line of sight, the three-dimensional galaxy redshift\npower spectrum Pobs (~k) depends only on k and \u03bc, i.e. is reduced to two dimensions by\nsymmetry [50].\nTo minimise nonlinear effects, we restrict wave-numbers to the quasi-linear regime,\nso that kmax is given by requiring that the variance of matter fluctuations in a sphere of\nradius R is \u03c3 2 (R) = 0.25 for R = \u03c0/(2kmax ). This gives kmax \u2243 0.1h Mpc\u22121 at z = 0\nand kmax \u2243 0.2h Mpc\u22121 at z = 1, well within the quasi-linear regime. In addition, we\nimpose a uniform upper limit of kmax \u2264 0.2h Mpc\u22121 (i.e. kmax = 0.2h Mpc\u22121 at z > 1), to\nensure that we are only considering the conservative linear regime, essentially unaffected\nby nonlinear effects. In each bin we adopt kmin = 10\u22124 h/Mpc, and we have verified that\nchanging the survey maximum scale kmin with the shell volume has almost no effect on the\nresults.\n\n\u20138\u2013\n\n\fFor the moment, we do not include information from the amplitude \u1e20(zi ) and the\nredshift space distortions \u03b2(zi , k), so we marginalise over these parameters8 and also over\ni\n. Then we project p = {H(zi ), DA (zi ), \u03c9m , \u03c9b , \u03b6, ns , h} into the final sets q of cosPshot\nmological parameters described in \u00a74 [63, 64]. In this way we adopt the so-called \"full\nP (k)\u2013method, marginalised over growth\u2013information\" [65], and, to change from one set of\nparameters to another, we use [63]\nLSS\n=\nF\u03b1\u03b2\n\nX \u2202pi\n\u2202pj\nFijLSS\n,\n\u2202q\u03b1\n\u2202q\u03b2\n\n(2.10)\n\nij\n\nLSS is the survey Fisher matrix for the set of parameters q, and F LSS is the survey\nwhere F\u03b1\u03b2\nij\nFisher matrix for the set of equivalent parameters p.\nWe derive neutrino constraints with and without cosmic microwave background (CMB)\npriors; to this end we use the specifications of the Planck9 satellite. As explained in\nAppendix A, in order to describe CMB temperature and polarisation power spectra, we\nchoose the parameter set ~\n\u03b8 = {\u03c9m , \u03c9b , \u03b6, 100\u03b8S , ln(1010 \u22062R (k0 )), nS , \u03c4 }, where \u03b8S is the\nangular size of the sound horizon at last scattering, and \u03c4 is the optical depth due to\nreionisation. After marginalisation over the optical depth, we propagate the Planck CMB\nFisher matrix FijCMB into the final sets of parameters q, by using the appropriate Jacobian\nfor the involved parameter transformation.\np\nThe 1\u2013\u03c3 error on q\u03b1 marginalised over the other parameters is \u03c3(q\u03b1 ) = (F \u22121 )\u03b1\u03b1 ,\nwhere F \u22121 is the inverse of the Fisher matrix. We then consider constraints in a twoparameter subspace, marginalising over the remaining parameters, in order to study the\ncovariance between Neff or M\u03bd and the other cosmological parameters, respectively.\nFurthermore, to quantify the level of degeneracy between the different parameters, we\nestimate the so-called correlation coefficients, given by\n\n(F \u22121 )p\u03b1 p\u03b2\n,\nr\u2261q\n(F \u22121 )p\u03b1 p\u03b1 (F \u22121 )p\u03b2 p\u03b2\n\n(2.11)\n\nwhere p\u03b1 denotes one of the model parameters. When the coefficient |r| = 1, the two\nparameters are totally degenerate, while r = 0 means they are uncorrelated.\nLSS , and from the combined\nWe evaluate \u03c3(q\u03b1 ) and r both from survey data F\u03b1\u03b2\nCMB\nLSS\nCMB+LSS data F\u03b1\u03b2 = F\u03b1\u03b2 + F\u03b1\u03b2 .\n\n3. Surveys: two spectroscopic strategies\nIn this work we forecast neutrino constraints using two different spectroscopic approaches.\nIn particular, as mentioned in \u00a71, we consider the cases relative to two space mission\nconcepts under study:\n8\n\nIn this case, we make derivatives of Pobs (k, z) with respect to \u03b2(zi , k). These derivatives are scale\ndependent, independently on the scale-dependence of \u03b2. Then we integrate over k, as written Eq. (2.8); in\nthis way we are left with the \u03b2 redshift-dependence alone. Finally, we marginalise over it.\n9\nwww.rssd.esa.int/index.php?project=planck\n\n\u20139\u2013\n\n\f\u2022 a EUCLID-like survey of H\u03b1 emission line galaxies, based on slitless spectroscopy of\nthe sky. We adopt the empirical redshift distribution of H\u03b1 emission line galaxies\nderived by [66] from observed H\u03b1 luminosity functions, and the bias function derived\nby [67] using a galaxy formation simulation. In particular, we choose a flux limit of\n4\u00d710\u221216 erg s\u22121 cm\u22121 , a survey area of 20,000 deg2 , a redshift success rate e = 0.5, a\nredshift accuracy of \u03c3z /(1 + z) \u2264 0.001, and a redshift range 0.5 \u2264 z \u2264 2.1. The total\nnumber of galaxies with redshift errors \u03c3z /(1 + z) \u2264 0.001 from a slitless survey is\nwell approximated by [65]\n0.14\n\u0001\nNgal\n[area] e\n \u0304 \u22120.9(f \u0304) ,\n=\n276.74\nf\n106\n20000 0.5\n\n(3.1)\n\nwhere f \u0304 \u2261 f /[10\u221216 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 ]10 . For this type of space-based slitless redshift\nsurvey we add in our forecasts also information from the ongoing Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey III (SDSS-III) Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS)11 of luminous\nred galaxies (LRG). For this galaxy survey we assume that the LRG redshifts are\nmeasured over 0.1 < z < 0.5 12 with standard deviation \u03c3z /(1 + z) = 0.001, for a\ngalaxy population with a fixed number density of n = 3 \u00d7 10\u22124 h3 Mpc\u22123 , and a fixed\nlinear bias of b = 1.7 [68], over a survey area of 10,000 deg2 .\n\u2022 a H-band magnitude limited survey of randomly sampled galaxies enabled by multislit spectroscopy (e.g., SPACE [41], JEDI [38, 39, 40], and possibly WFIRST in the\nfuture). To predict galaxy densities for such surveys we use the empirical galaxy\nredshift distribution compiled by Zamorani et al. from existing data [43], and we\nuse predictions of galaxy bias from galaxy formation simulations [67]. We consider\nmulti-slit surveys with a limiting magnitude of HAB =22, a redshift success rate of\n90%, a sampling rate of 35%, a survey area of 20,000 deg2 , a redshift accuracy of\n\u03c3z /(1 + z) \u2264 0.001, and a redshift range 0.1 \u2264 z \u2264 2.1. The total number of galaxies\nwith redshift errors \u03c3z /(1 + z) \u2264 0.001 from a multi-slit survey is well approximated\nby [65]\n\u0003 [area]\nNgal \u0002\ne\n= 192.21 + 197.03 (HAB \u2212 22)1.3\n.\n(3.2)\n6\n10\n20000 0.9 \u00d7 0.35\n\nNote that BOSS data are not added to the multi-slit galaxy redshift survey, since the\nlatter has redshift ranges that extend to z \u223c 0.1 [41, 43]. The case is different for H\u03b1\nflux selected galaxies observed from space, since a wavelength range between 1 and 2 \u03bcm\nnaturally imposes a redshift range 0.52 < z < 2.05 in which H\u03b1 will be visible [43].\nFurthermore, the bias functions for H\u03b1 flux and H-band magnitude selected galaxies\nincrease with redshift, with the former being less strongly biased than the latter [67]. In\nfact, the H-band traces massive structures (similar to selecting galaxies in the K-band),\n10\n\nWe note that this case is similar also to JDEM and ADEPT.\nhttp://www.sdss3.org/surveys/boss.php\n12\nFor BOSS the actual redshift range is 0.1 < z < 0.7, but we do not take into account the shell\n0.5 < z < 0.7 in order to avoid overlapping in z between the space\u2013 and ground\u2013based redshift surveys\ndiscussed in this work.\n11\n\n\u2013 10 \u2013\n\n\fwhich makes them strongly biased. Star forming galaxies (which are selected by H\u03b1 flux),\non the other hand, appear to avoid the cores of clusters and populate the filaments of the\ndark-matter structure, making them less biased than H-band galaxies [67].\nIn conclusion, multi-slit surveys allow accurate redshift measurement for a larger number of galaxies (and these galaxies are more biased tracers of large-scale structure than\nstar-forming galaxies), and over a greater redshift range (extending to z \u223c 0.1) than slitless surveys. This can improve the constraints on neutrino masses, and, moreover, the\nability to split a galaxy catalogue into red and blue galaxies could provide an important\ndiagnostic test of potential systematic errors when measuring neutrino masses [69]. However, multi-slit surveys have substantially stronger requirements in instrumentation and\nmission implementation [41].\n\n4. Fiducial cosmologies: M\u03bd and Neff\nThe Fisher matrix approach propagates errors of galaxy power spectrum measurements\nEq. (2.2) into errors of the cosmological parameters which characterise the underlying\nfiducial cosmology. According to the latest observations (e.g. [5] and refs. therein), we\nassume the fiducial cosmological model adopted in the Euclid Assessment Study Report\n[43] with the exception that we normalise to the amplitude of the primordial curvature\nperturbations \u22062R (k0 ) instead of \u03c38 : \u03a9m = 0.25, h = 0.7, \u22062R (k0 ) = 2.45 \u00d7 10\u22129 , \u03a9b =\n0.0445, ns = 113 . We consider neither primordial gravitational waves nor a scale dependent\ncomponent of the scalar spectral index, and assume the matter energy density \u03a9m to include\nthe neutrino contribution when neutrinos are non-relativistic\n\u03a9m = \u03a9c + \u03a9b + \u03a9\u03bd ,\n\n(4.1)\n\nMoreover, we also assume dark-energy to be a cosmic fluid described by a redshift\ndependent equation of state\npde (z)\nwde (z) =\n(4.2)\n\u03c1de (z)\nwhere pde and \u03c1de represent respectively the pressure and energy density of the dark-energy\nfluid.\nThis in turn yields a redshift dependent dark-energy density\n\u0015\n\u0014 Z z\n1 + w(z \u2032 ) \u2032\ndz ,\n(4.3)\n\u03c1de (z) = \u03c1de (0) exp 3\n1 + z\u2032\n0\nfor which we take a fiducial value \u03a9de = 0.75. Finally, to compute our forecasts on darkenergy parameters, we adopt the widely used linear dark-energy equation of state [70, 71]\nwde (a) = w0 + (1 \u2212 a)wa ,\n13\n\n(4.4)\n\nCMB constraints give ns \u223c 0.96, anyway we have verified that adopting the latter value of ns changes\nneutrino mass constraints by \u223c5%, and the dark-energy equation of state parameter errors by \u223c10%, at\nthe maximum.\n\n\u2013 11 \u2013\n\n\fwhere a \u2261 1/(1 + z) is the scale factor normalised to unity at present, and we assume as\nfiducial values w0 = \u22120.95 and wa = 0, which lie well within the current 95% C.L. limits.\nIn what follows, the dark-energy figure of merit (FoM) will be computed in terms of the\nconventional FoM for (w0 ,wa ) as proposed by DETF [72] to compare dark-energy surveys.\nWe will constraint the following final set of eight parameters\n\b\n(4.5)\nq = \u03a9m , \u03a9de , h, \u22062R (k0 ), \u03a9b , w0 , wa , ns ,\n\nwhich constitutes what we call our \"base\" parameters14 , to which we add the \u03b6 parameter\nas we explain below15 .\nIn what follows, we will consider six different fiducial models matching our \"base\"\nfiducial \u039bCDM cosmology, in which we adopt the same fiducial values for the eight \"base\"\nparameters. Then we specify the assumed cosmological models:\n\n\u2022 The first model assumes a Neff \u2013cosmology, where neutrinos are effectively massless\nbut the the number of relativistic species \u03b6 \u2261 Neff can deviate from the standard\nvalue Neff = 3.04. In this case the fiducial value Neff |fid = 3.04 is chosen, fixing\nM\u03bd = const = 016 [25]. Neff is given by the energy density associated to the total\nradiation\n\u03a9r = \u03a9\u03b3 (1 + 0.2271Neff ) ,\n(4.6)\nwhere \u03a9\u03b3 = 2.469 \u00d7 10\u22125 h\u22122 is the present-day photon energy density parameter for\nTcmb = 2.725 K [73].\n\u2022 The remaining models assume a M\u03bd \u2013cosmology, where Neff is fixed at the fiducial\nvalue and \u03b6 \u2261 M\u03bd is allowed to vary accordingly to the assumed fiducial neutrino\nmass spectrum [23].

In particular, there\nis a quite strong positive correlation r \u223c 0.55 between the total neutrino mass M\u03bd and\nthe matter density \u03a9m . In fact, since neutrino free-streaming suppresses the total matter\ntransfer function on scales smaller than the free-streaming scale kfs , increasing the neutrino\nmass produces on T (k, z) the opposite effect than increasing the total matter content of\nthe Universe. For the same reason, massive neutrinos mimic the effect of a red tilt on\nthe galaxy power spectrum, resulting in a positive correlation between M\u03bd and the scalar\nspectral index ns . Moreover, M\u03bd is also positively correlated to the baryon density \u03a9b if\nthe total matter content of the Universe is held fixed (a larger \u03a9b enhances the BAO and\nthe information content of T (k, z)). The correlation of M\u03bd with the remaining parameters\nh, \u03a9de , w0 , and wa can be explained looking at the Alcock-Paczynski prefactor in Eq.

(5.1) and looking at the sign\nof the term [(1 + z)3(1+w0 +wa ) e3wa (a\u22121) \u2212 (1 + z)2 ], we also deduce that increasing \u03a9de or\nwa produces on Pobs the same effect as a larger neutrino mass, so these parameters are\nnegatively correlated or \"anti-correlated\" to M\u03bd .\nExcept for the ns case, we find that the level of correlation is on the average stable\nagainst the value of the fiducial total neutrino mass and the spectroscopic strategy adopted.\nFor what concerns the mass hierarchy, at a given M\u03bd |fid , the ns -M\u03bd correlation looks to be\nlarger by \u223c 54%\u221272% for normal hierarchy in comparison to the inverted one, at least when\ninformation from LSS alone are used, and the effect is more evident for slitless spectroscopy.\nIn contrast, the h-M\u03bd and \u03a9b -M\u03bd correlations slightly decrease by \u223c 34%\u221224% respectively,\nfor normal hierarchy compared to the inverted hierarchy. This can be understood if we\nconsider that, for the same M\u03bd |fid , in the case of normal hierarchy, the transfer function\nis slightly less suppressed on the scales of interest with respect to the inverted one (see\nFig. 2, and \u00a7 5.2 for further comments on the relation between forecasted M\u03bd \u2013errors and\n\n\u2013 17 \u2013\n\n\fFigure 4: 2-parameter Neff -q\u03b1 joint contours with q\u03b1 = \u03a9de , w0 , wa , ns for the fiducial model with\nextra relativistic degrees of freedom Neff = 3.04, obtained after combining the slitless survey data\nwith BOSS data and Planck priors.

In particular, the correlation between M\u03bd and ns is completely resolved, being reduced by \u223c one order of magnitude. In\nsome cases, the correlation coefficient r can even change sign (see columns 2-6 in the lower\npanels of Tables 3-4). This change in the behaviour of r arises either due to the presence of\ndominant parameter degeneracies affecting the CMB spectrum, or because of marginalisation of a high-dimension parameter space down to two variables. To summarise, after the\ninclusion of Planck priors, the remaining dominant correlations among M\u03bd and the other\ncosmological parameters are M\u03bd -\u03a9de , M\u03bd -\u03a9m , and M\u03bd -wa .\n5.2 M\u03bd \u2013cosmology: Forecasted error-bars\nThe 1\u2013\u03c3 errors of the parameters are shown in columns 2-6 of Tables 1-2. We see that,\nwith respect to the slitless spectroscopy, the multi-slit spectroscopy is able to reduce the\nneutrino mass errors of about 20%-30%, depending on the fiducial neutrino mass, if LSS\ndata alone are used. In addition, for the same M\u03bd |fid , the 1\u2013\u03c3 error on total neutrino mass\n\n\u2013 18 \u2013\n\n\fFigure 5: 1-parameter confidence levels at 1-\u03c3 for M\u03bd and q\u03b1 with q\u03b1 = \u03a9de , w0 , wa , \u03a9m for the\nfiducial model with M\u03bd = 0.05 eV and a neutrino mass spectrum with normal hierarchy, obtained\nafter combining the survey data with Planck priors. The blue solid line and the red dashed one\nrepresent the slitles+BOSS\u2013 and multi-slit\u2013surveys cases respectively, as described in Sec. 3.\n\nfor normal hierarchy is \u223c 17% \u2212 20% larger than for the inverted one. It looks like that the\nmatter power spectrum is less able to give information on the total neutrino mass when the\nnormal hierarchy is assumed as fiducial neutrino mass spectrum. This is similar to what\nfound in Ref. [23] for the constraints on the neutrino mass hierarchy itself, when a normal\nhierarchy is assumed as the fiducial one. On the other hand, when CMB information are\nincluded, the M\u03bd -errors decrease by \u223c35% in favour of the normal hierarchy, at a given\nM\u03bd |fid . This difference arises from the changes in the free-streaming effect due to the\nassumed mass hierarchy, and is in agreement with the results in Ref. [24], which confirms\nthat the expected errors on the neutrino masses depend not only on the sum of neutrino\nmasses, but also on the order of the mass splitting between the neutrino mass states.\nWhen Planck priors are added, we find that the 1\u2013\u03c3 errors on M\u03bd are in the range\n0.03 \u2212 0.05 eV, depending on the fiducial total neutrino mass, with an average difference of\n15% between the two spectroscopic strategies, favouring again the multi-slit spectroscopy.\nThis means that fixing some of the model free parameters, e.g. assuming a \u039bCDM Universe,\nfuture spectroscopic galaxy surveys, combined with CMB probes, will be able to measure\nthe minimum total neutrino mass M\u03bd = 0.05 eV required by oscillation experiments; we\nwill further comment on this in \u00a75.6. Finally, depending on M\u03bd |fid , the total CMB+LSS\n\n\u2013 19 \u2013\n\n\fFigure 6: 1-parameter confidence levels for Neff and q\u03b1 with q\u03b1 = \u03a9de , w0 , wa , ns for the fiducial\nmodel with Neff = 3.04, obtained after combining the survey data with Planck priors.

(4.5), for LSS alone and in combination with Planck errors.\nInterpreting the sign of the correlations is not so straightforward for the Neff \u2013\ncosmology, since the number of relativistic species gives two opposite contributions to\nPobs , and the total sign of the correlation depends on the dominant one, for each single\ncosmological parameter. In fact, from the bottom-left panel of Fig. 2, it is clear that a\nlarger Neff value suppresses the transfer function T (k) on scales k \u2264 kmax . On the other\nhand, from Eq. (4.6) and Eq. (5.1), we see that a larger Neff value also increases the AlcockPaczynski prefactor in Pobs . For what concerns the dark-energy parameters \u03a9de , w0 , wa ,\nand the dark-matter density \u03a9m , we find that the Alcock-Paczynski prefactor dominates,\n\n\u2013 20 \u2013\n\n\fFigure 7: Top: M\u03bd \u2013errors, for M\u03bd |fid = 0.05 eV, as functions of the minimum redshift zmin of\nthe surveys, where we have fixed the maximum redshift zmax = 2.1 for both the spectroscopic\nstrategies.

In\ncontrast, for the other parameters, the T (k) suppression produces the larger effect and\nNeff results to be anti-correlated to \u03a9b , and positively correlated to h and ns . See the\nlast column in the upper panels of Tables 3-4 for the LSS alone case. The degree of the\ncorrelation r is stable against the spectroscopic strategy adopted and is very large in the\nns -Neff case, being r \u223c 0.8 with and without Planck priors. For the remaining cosmological\nparameters, all the correlations are reduced when CMB information are added, except for\nthe covariance Neff -\u03a9de , as happens also for the M\u03bd \u2013cosmology. To summarise, after the\ninclusion of Planck priors, the remaining dominant correlations among Neff and the other\ncosmological parameters are Neff -ns , Neff -\u03a9de , and Neff -h.\n5.4 Neff \u2013cosmology: Forecasted errors\nThe 1\u2013\u03c3 errors of the parameters are shown in the last column of Tables 1-2. Also in this\ncase, compared to the slitless spectroscopy, the multi-slit spectroscopy is able to reduce\nthe Neff errors by \u223c30% when LSS alone are used. When Planck priors are added, we find\n\n\u2013 21 \u2013\n\n\fFigure 8: Top: Neff \u2013errors as functions of the minimum redshift zmin of the surveys, where we have\nfixed the maximum redshift zmax = 2.1 for both the spectroscopic strategies.

Bottom: Neff \u2013errors as functions of the maximum redshift zmax of the surveys, where\nwe have fixed the minimum redshifts zmin = 0.5 and zmin = 0.1 for the slitless and multi-slit\nspectroscopies, respectively.\n\na 1\u2013\u03c3 error on Neff of \u223c 0.08, with a difference of only 6% between the two spectroscopy\nstrategies, again in favour of the multi-slit one.\n5.5 Constraints on neutrino properties in the context of dark energy surveys\nThe main science goal of the galaxy surveys considered in this work is to constrain dark\nenergy. Considering neutrinos properties might degrade the dark energy constraints (because of the introduction of extra parameters in the model), or it may be that such surveys\nare not optimised (e.g., in their redshift coverage) to measure neutrino properties and thus\nperform sub-optimally for these parameters.\nWe find that, depending on the fiducial M\u03bd value, the total CMB+LSS dark-energy\nFoM decreases only by \u223c 15% \u2212 25% with respect to the FoM obtained if neutrinos are\nassumed to be massless, and that, for the Neff \u2013cosmology, the total CMB+LSS dark-energy\nFoM decreases only by \u223c 5% with respect to the FoM obtained by holding Neff fixed. This\nmeans that the \"P (k)\u2013method marginalised over growth\u2013information\" is quite robust in\nconstraining the dark-energy equation of state.\n\n\u2013 22 \u2013\n\n\fIn Figs. 3-4 we show the jointly 2-parameter projected 68% C.L., 95.4% C.L.\nand 99.73% C.L. contours in the \u03b6-q\u03b1 sub-space, where \u03b6 = M\u03bd , Neff and q\u03b1 =\n\u03a9de , w0 , wa , \u03a9m , ns , in the case of the slitless survey in combination with BOSS and Planck\npriors, for the Neff \u2013 and M\u03bd (= 0.3 eV)\u2013cosmologies. The black solid lines show the 1parameter confidence levels at 1\u2013\u03c3. The orientation of the ellipses reflects the correlations\namong the parameters shown in the lower panels of Tables 3-4.\nMoreover, for a visual comparison of the constraints obtained with the two spectroscopic strategies, in Figs. 5-6 we show the 1-parameter confidence levels at 1-\u03c3 in the \u03b6-q\u03b1\nsub-space for the combinations slitless+BOSS+Planck and multi-slit+Planck, respectively.\nFinally, we consider the fiducial cosmology with M\u03bd |fid = 0.05 eV and, in the top\npanels of Fig. 7, we show the M\u03bd \u2013errors as functions of the minimum redshift zmin of the\nsurveys, with and without Planck priors. We fix the maximum redshift zmax = 2.1 for both\nthe spectroscopic strategies, while the lowest minimum redshifts are given by zmin = 0.5\nand zmin = 0.1 for the slitless and multi-slit spectroscopies, respectively. In the bottom\npanels of Fig. 7, we show the M\u03bd \u2013errors as functions of the maximum redshift zmax of the\nsurveys, where we have fixed the minimum redshifts zmin = 0.5 and zmin = 0.1 for the\nslitless and multi-slit spectroscopies, respectively. For the slitless case, we have verified\nthat extending the minimum redshift to zmin = 0.1 changes the neutrino constraints by\n\u223c0.8% only. We make the same analysis for the Neff \u2013errors and the corresponding trends\nare shown in Fig. 8.\nNote that concerning the possible degeneracies with the dark-energy parameters, we\nfind that the major covariance is with \u03a9de , rather than with the dark energy equation of\nstate parameters w0 and wa , and that extending the redshift range of the surveys considered\nwould not reduce drastically the forecasted errors18 .\n5.6 The effects of growth inclusion and random peculiar velocities on neutrino\nmass constraints\nIt is well known that galaxy peculiar velocities produce redshift-space distortions (RDS),\nwhich can be exploited by a large deep redshift survey to measure the growth rate of\ndensity fluctuations fg , within the same redshift bins in which H(z) is estimated via BAO.\nIn particular, RDS allow to constrain fg times the normalisation of the power spectrum,\ni.e. fg \u03c38 . In order to include growth information in our Fisher matrix analysis, following\nRef. [65], we rewrite Eq. (2.3) as\n\"\n#2\n2\nkrefk\nDA (z)2ref H(z)\n\u03c38g (z) + fg (z, k)\u03c38 (z) 2\n\u00d7 C(k, z) + Pshot ,\nPobs (kref\u22a5 , krefk , z) =\n2\nDA (z)2 H(z)ref\nkref\u22a5 + krefk\n(5.2)\nwhere C(k, z) \u2261 Pmatter (k, z)/\u03c382 (z), and \u03c38g (z) = b(z)\u03c38 (z). We refer to this as the \"full\nP (k)\u2013method, with growth\u2013information included\". Let us stress that we model RDS as an\n18\n\nConcerning the dependence of M\u03bd \u2013 and Neff \u2013errors on the survey area, we note that F LSS is linearly\ndependent on the effective survey volume Veff (see Eqs. (2.8)-(2.9)), therefore \u03c3(M\u03bd ) and \u03c3(Neff ), extracted\nfrom LSS data alone, are inversely proportional to the square root of the survey area, for a fixed redshift\nrange.\n\n\u2013 23 \u2013\n\n\fadditive component, using as free parameters (b\u03c38 , fg \u03c38 ). fg \u03c38 can be measured without\nknowing the bias b or the amplitude of the matter fluctuations \u03c38 ; therefore this parameter\nchoice reduces possible systematic errors due to estimates of the bias [76].\nWhile, for large separations, galaxy peculiar velocities give information on the growth\nof structures, on small scales random peculiar velocities cause the so-called Fingers of God\n(FoG), stretching compact structures along the line-of-sight [76, 77]. Although, on the\nscales of interest in this work, this effect is expected to be moderate [78, 79], we now include\nit in the Fisher analysis by introducing a Gaussian distribution for the pairwise velocity\n2 2 2\ndispersion in configuration space, which produces a Gaussian damping e\u2212k \u03bc \u03c3v of the\nobserved galaxy power spectrum Pobs . This effect is degenerate with possible inaccuracies\n\u03c3z in the observed redshifts due to a line-of-sight smearing of the structures, so we absorb\nit in the Gaussian damping factor of Eq. (2.5).\nFor the sake of simplicity, we consider only the fiducial cosmology with M\u03bd = 0.05\neV. In fact, in this case, the scale dependence of the growth rate fg due to free-streaming\nmassive neutrinos can be assumed to be negligible. This is evident from the bottomright panel of Fig. 2, where we show the scale dependence correction to fg for M\u03bd = 0.05\neV, given by the function \u03bc(k, f\u03bd , \u03a9de ) \u2261 fg (M\u03bd 6= 0)/fg (M\u03bd = 0), where f\u03bd = \u03a9\u03bd /\u03a9m ,\nintroduced by Ref. [11] in their Eqs. (16)-(17). In this case the growth suppression is only\nof the order of 0.2%, affecting scales k > 0.1 h/Mpc.\nUnder these assumptions, when we include the effect of FoG in the Fisher analysis,\nwe consider also \u03c3v (zi ) as a scale independent variable, which is treated as a nuisance\ni\n},\nparameter to be marginalised over in each redshift bin, together with {\u03c38g (zi ), Pshot\nand we project the errors on {H(zi ), DA (zi ), fg (zi )\u03c38 (zi ), \u03c9m , \u03c9b , \u03b6, ns , h} into the\nfinal set of cosmological parameters {\u03a9m , \u03a9de , \u03a9b , h, \u03b6, w0 , wa , ns , \u03c38 }. This parameter\nset differs from Eq. (4.5) only for the substitution \u22062R (k0 ) \u2192 \u03c38 , whose fiducial value\nis fixed by \u22062R (k0 ) = 2.45 \u00d7 10\u22129 and the other parameters of the M\u03bd |fid (= 0.05eV)\u2013\ncosmology described in \u00a74 . We refer to this as the \"full P (k)\u2013method, with FoG and\ngrowth\u2013information included\".\nIn what follows we compare the M\u03bd constraints obtained by the three P (k)\u2013methods\nconsidered in this work, for the fiducial cosmology with M\u03bd |fid = 0.05 eV.\n5.6.1 Growth inclusion effects\nWe find that neutrino mass errors are quite stable at \u03c3(M\u03bd ) = 0.05 eV, against the adopted\nmethod (whether growth\u2013information are included or marginalised over), and decrease only\nby 10%\u201320% when fg \u03c38 measurements are included. We can understand this result as follows. \u03a9\u03bd affects the shape of the power spectrum, i.e. enters the transfer function T (k, z),\nwhich is sampled on a very large range of scales, including the P (k) turnover scale, by the\nnearly full-sky surveys under consideration. On the other hand, fg is only slightly dependent on M\u03bd for M\u03bd |fid = 0.05 eV (see the bottom-right panel of Fig. 2). Consequently, the\neffect on the observed power spectrum shape dominates over the information extracted by\nmeasurements of fg \u03c38 . This quantity, in turn, generates new correlations with M\u03bd via the\n\u03c38 -term, which now we constrain simultaneously with the other cosmological parameters,\n\n\u2013 24 \u2013\n\n\fand which actually is anti-correlated with M\u03bd 19 [80].\nOn the other hand, if we suppose that early dark-energy is negligible, the dark-energy\nparameters \u03a9de , w0 and wa do not enter the transfer function, and consequently growth\ninformation have relatively more weight when added to constraints from H(z) and DA (z)\nalone.\nAs a result, the M\u03bd \u2013errors are quite insensitive to growth inclusion, hence almost\nindependent of the adopted P (k)\u2013method. This is in contrast to the dark-energy parameter\nconstraints (see e.g. Ref. [11]). In fact, we find that, with respect to the \"full P (k)\u2013method,\nmarginalised over growth\u2013information\", the \"full P (k)\u2013method, with growth\u2013information\nincluded\" is able to increase the dark-energy FoM by \u223c 50% and \u223c 60% for the slitless\nand multi-slit strategies, respectively, from both LSS data alone and in combination with\nPlanck priors, when massive neutrinos are assumed in the fiducial cosmology.\nTo summarise, we find that, due to the slight dependence of fg on M\u03bd when M\u03bd |fid =\n0.05 eV, and due to the further degeneracy with \u03c38 (correlated also with the dark-energy\nparameters), we do not find a total effective gain on the accuracy of M\u03bd measurements,\nwhen growth-information are added. On the other hand, the value of the dark-energy\nFoM does increase when growth-information are included, even if it decreases by a factor\n\u223c 2 \u2212 3 with respect to cosmologies where neutrinos are assumed to be massless, due to the\ncorrelation among M\u03bd and the dark-energy parameters. As confirmation of this degeneracy,\nwe find that, when growth-information are added and if the dark-energy parameters \u03a9de ,\nw0 , wa are held fixed to their fiducial values, the errors \u03c3(M\u03bd ) decrease to 0.027 eV and\n0.025 eV, for the slitless and multi-slit spectroscopies combined with Planck, respectively.\n5.6.2 Incoherent velocity inclusion effects\nWe expect that dark-energy parameter errors are somewhat sensitive to FoG effects. This\ncan be understood in terms of correlation functions in the redshift-space; the stretching\neffect due to random peculiar velocities contrasts the flattening effect due to large-scale\nbulk velocities. Consequently, these two competing effects act along opposite directions on\nthe dark-energy parameter constraints.\nWe find that the dark-energy FoM obtained with the \"full P (k)\u2013method, with FoG and\ngrowth\u2013information included\" result to be FoMLSS = 51, 95 and FoMLSS+CMB = 268, 391,\nfor the slitless and multi-slit spectroscopies respectively, i.e. very similar to the FoMs\nobtained from the \"full P (k)\u2013method, marginalised over growth\u2013information\", as shown\nin Tables 1-2, which therefore can be considered a more stable approach against galaxy\npeculiar velocity uncertainties.\nOn the other hand, the neutrino mass errors are expected to be almost stable at\n\u03c3(M\u03bd ) = 0.05 when FoGs effects are taken into account by marginalising over \u03c3v (z),\nincreasing only by 10%\u201314% with respect to the \"full P (k)\u2013method, marginalised over\n19\n\nIn particular, using the \"full P (k)\u2013method, with growth\u2013information included\", we find\n\u03c3(\u03c38 ) \u223c 0.011, 0.0085 for BOSS+slitless and multi-slit, respectively, and \u03c3(\u03c38 ) \u223c 0.0014, 0.0013 for\nBOSS+slitless+Planck and multi-slit+Planck, respectively. Using the \"full P (k)\u2013method, with FoG and\ngrowth\u2013information included\", we find \u03c3(\u03c38 ) \u223c 0.012, 0.0096 for BOSS+slitless and multi-slit, respectively,\nand again \u03c3(\u03c38 ) \u223c 0.0014, 0.0013 for BOSS+slitless+Planck and multi-slit+Planck, respectively.\n\n\u2013 25 \u2013\n\n\fgrowth\u2013information\". Moreover, in this case, if the dark-energy parameters \u03a9de , w0 , wa\nare held fixed to their fiducial values, the errors \u03c3(M\u03bd ) become 0.029\u20130.028 eV, for the\nslitless and multi-slit spectroscopies combined with Planck, respectively. In other words,\nwe get errors which are only \u223c11% larger than the ones obtained without marginalising\nover \u03c3v (z) under the same assumptions on \u03a9de , w0 , and wa , as described in \u00a75.6.1.\n5.7 Systematic effects, non-linearities and bias\nFisher-matrix based forecasts are not particularly well suited to quantify systematic effects.\nThe errors reported so far are statistical errors, which are meaningful only as long as\nthey dominate over systematic errors. It is therefore important to consider sources of\nsystematics and their possible effects on the recovered parameters. Possible sources of\nsystematic errors of major concern are the effect of non-linearities and the effects of galaxy\nbias. In our analysis so far we have used the linear theory matter power spectrum and\napplied scale-independent bias to it.\nThe description of non-linearities in the matter power spectrum in the presence of\nmassive neutrinos is a relatively new subject. It has been addressed in several different\nways: Refs. [81, 75, 82, 83] use perturbation theory, Ref. [84] used the time-RG flow\napproach and Refs. [85, 86, 88, 13] used different schemes of N-body simulations. From\nthe above references it is clear that the effect of massive neutrinos on the matter power\nspectrum in the non-linear regime must be explored via N-body simulations to encompass\nall the relevant effects. Different simulations schemes and approximations agree already\nat or below the % level (for neutrino masses allowed by current observations and k < 1\nMpc/h) indicating that non-linear effects on the matter power spectrum can in the future\nbe modelled to the required accuracy.\nOn the scales considered in this work the effects of non-linearities are small and\nstatistical\u2013errors could be further reduced considering smaller scales. As shown in [75],\nthe effect of non linearities does not erase or reduce the effect of massive neutrinos. In fact,\nby comparing Fig. 4 of [75] and e.g., Fig. 4 of [86], it is apparent that the difference between\nthe massless and massive neutrino case is enhanced by non-linearities. Thus while it will\nbe mandatory to include non-linearities in the actual data analysis, the forecasted errors\nare not made artificially smaller by using the linear matter power spectrum to compute\nour Fisher matrices.\nPushing to smaller scales however would worsen the systematic effect of scaledependent and/or non-linear bias. Here we have made the simplifying assumption that\nbias is scale-independent up to kmax but the redshift dependence is not known and is\nmarginalised over. Bias is known to be scale-independent on large, linear scales but to\nbecome non-linear and scale-dependent for small scales and/or for very massive halos. A\nscale-dependence of bias may mimic in part the effect of massive neutrinos. The scaledependence of bias however is expected not to have the same redshift dependence as\nmassive neutrino effects, thus offering the possibility to break a possible degeneracy. A\nscale-dependence of bias may cancel in part the effect of massive neutrinos. It arises because halos, especially massive or rare ones, are non-linearly biased with respect to the dark\nmatter. Scale-dependent bias (at least for dark matter halos hosting galaxies) is found first\n\n\u2013 26 \u2013\n\n\fTable 5: \u03c3(M\u03bd ) and \u03c3(Neff ) marginalised errors from LSS+CMB\nGeneral cosmology\nfiducial\u2192\nslitless+BOSS+Planck\nmulti-slit+Planck\n\nM\u03bd =0.3 eVa M\u03bd =0.2 eVa M\u03bd =0.125 eVb M\u03bd =0.125 eVc M\u03bd =0.05 eVb Neff =3.04d\n\n0.035\n0.030\n\n0.043\n0.038\n\n0.031\n0.027\n\n0.044\n0.039\n\n0.053\n0.046\n\n0.086\n0.082\n\n0.021\n0.018\n\n0.021\n0.018\n\n0.023\n0.019\n\n\u039bCDM cosmology\nslitless+BOSS+Planck\nmulti-slit+Planck\n\n0.017\n0.015\n\n0.019\n0.016\n\n0.017\n0.014\n\na for degenerate spectrum: m \u2248 m \u2248 m ; b for normal hierarchy: m 6= 0, m \u2248 m \u2248 0\n1\n2\n3\n3\n1\n2\nc\n\nfor inverted hierarchy: m1 \u2248 m2 , m3 \u2248 0; d fiducial cosmology with massless neutrinos\n\nto increase with increasing |k| then decrease, but the bias of the galaxies hosted in the\ndark halos may be more complicated. This will be an important limitation in any practical\napplication especially if we want to include mildly non-linear scales. There are, however,\nseveral possibilities to control or quantify systematics introduced by bias. In fact, the bias\nbehaviour varies for differently selected objects (different colour or different brightness):\nsplitting the sample in differently-biased tracers will thus help disentangle the systematic\neffect from the cosmological signal (approach similar to that of e.g.,[69]). Finally on large,\nlinear scales, the neutrino mass splitting leaves a specific signature on the shape of the\npower spectrum that can also be used as a cross check of the M\u03bd signal as illustrated in\nRef. [87]. A more quantitative investigation of scale-dependent bias is beyond the scope of\nthis paper, but we plan to study this important issue as more data and simulations become\navailable.\n\n6. Conclusions\nIn this work we have forecasted errors on the total neutrino mass M\u03bd and the effective\nnumber of relativistic species Neff , by combining Planck priors with future data from spacebased spectroscopic galaxy redshift surveys in the near-IR. We have considered two survey\nstrategies based on slitless and multi-slit spectroscopies. The assumed set of cosmological\nparameters is very general and takes into account a time-varying dark-energy equation of\nstate, as well as a non-vanishing spatial curvature of the Universe. We exploited information\nfrom the galaxy power spectrum shape and BAO positions, marginalising over galaxy bias;\nthus our findings do not depend on bias measurement accuracy (as long as, on the large\nscales considered, bias is scale independent or its scale dependence is known), or modelling\nof the redshift dependence of bias [21].\nThe 1\u2013\u03c3 errors are shown in Tables 1-2, and the correlation coefficients in Tables 3-4.\nIn Figs. 3-5 we show the joint 2-parameter confidence levels.\nRegarding M\u03bd \u2013errors, we find that the multi-slit spectroscopy is able to reduce the\nneutrino mass errors of about 20%-30% compared to the slitless spectroscopy, depending\non the fiducial total neutrino mass, if LSS data alone are used. When Planck priors are\n\n\u2013 27 \u2013\n\n\fadded, the 1\u2013\u03c3 errors on M\u03bd are in the range 0.03 \u2212 0.05 eV, depending on the fiducial\nneutrino mass, with an average difference of 15% between the two spectroscopic strategies,\nfavouring the multi-slit spectroscopy.\nMoreover, depending on the fiducial M\u03bd \u2013value, the total CMB+LSS dark-energy FoM,\nwith growth\u2013information marginalised over, decreases only by \u223c 15%\u221225% with respect to\nthe value obtained if neutrinos are assumed to be massless (or their mass is assumed to be\nperfectly known), meaning that the \"P (k)\u2013method marginalised over growth\u2013information\"\nis quite robust to assumptions about model cosmology when constraining the dark-energy\nequation of state. The situation is different when we include growth-information, since in\nthis case the value of the dark-energy FoM decreases by a factor \u223c 2 \u2212 3 with respect to\ncosmologies that assume massless neutrinos.\nConsidering the fiducial cosmology with M\u03bd |fid = 0.05 eV, in \u00a75.6 we checked the\nstability of M\u03bd \u2013errors to the inclusion of growth\u2013information and peculiar velocity uncertainties. We compared the following approaches: the \"full P (k)\u2013method, marginalised over\ngrowth\u2013information\", the \"full P (k)\u2013method, with growth\u2013information included\", and \"full\nP (k)\u2013method, with FoG and growth\u2013information included\". We found that M\u03bd \u2013errors are\nquite stable at \u03c3(M\u03bd ) = 0.05 eV, against the adopted method. This result is as expected,\nif we consider that, unlike dark energy parameters, M\u03bd affects the shape of the power spectrum via a redshift-dependent transfer function T (k, z), which is sampled on a very large\nrange of scales including the P (k) turnover scale, therefore this effect dominates over the\ninformation extracted from measurements of fg \u03c38 .\nRegarding Neff \u2013errors, again we find that, compared to the slitless spectroscopy, the\nmulti-slit spectroscopy is able to reduce the Neff \u2013errors by \u223c30% when LSS alone are used.\nWhen Planck priors are added, we find \u03c3(Neff ) \u223c 0.08, with only a 6% difference between\nthe two spectroscopy strategies, again in favour of the multi-slit one. The total CMB+LSS\ndark-energy FoM decreases only by \u223c 5% with respect to the value obtained holding Neff\nfixed at its fiducial value, meaning that also in this case the \"P (k)\u2013method marginalised\nover growth\u2013information\" is not too sensitive to assumptions about model cosmology when\nconstraining the dark-energy equation of state.\nFinally, in Table 5 we summarise the dependence of the M\u03bd \u2013 and Neff \u2013errors on the\nmodel cosmology, for the two spectroscopic strategies combined with Planck. We conclude\nthat, if M\u03bd is > 0.1 eV, these surveys will be able to determine the neutrino mass scale\nindependently of the model cosmology assumed. If M\u03bd is < 0.1 eV, the sum of neutrino\nmasses, and in particular the minimum neutrino mass required by neutrino oscillations,\ncan be measured in the context of a \u039bCDM model.\nThis means that future spectroscopic galaxy surveys, such as Euclid or SPACE, JEDI,\nand possibly WFIRST in the future, will be able to cover the entire parameter space for\nneutrino mass allowed by oscillations experiments\nMoreover, as summarised in Fig. 1, they will be competitive with future 3D cosmic\nshear photometric surveys, which, in combination with Planck priors, will give similar\nconstraints on M\u03bd and Neff [9]. Since, these two kinds of LSS probe are affected by different\nsystematics, their constraints on neutrino masses and relativistic degrees of freedom will\nprovide a consistency check of the two independent measurement methods.\n\n\u2013 28 \u2013\n\n\fWe conclude that future nearly all-sky spectroscopic galaxy surveys will detect the\ncosmic neutrino background at high statistical significance, and provide a measurement\nof the neutrino mass scale. This will provide an important confirmation of our model for\nthe early Universe, and crucial insights into neutrino properties, highly complementary to\nfuture particle physics experiments.\n\nAcknowledgments\nCC acknowledges L.

Planck priors\nIn this work we use the Planck mission parameter constraints as CMB priors, by estimating\nthe cosmological parameter errors via measurements of the temperature and polarisation\npower spectra. As CMB anisotropies, with the exception of the integrated Sachs-Wolfe\neffect, are not able to constrain the equation of state of dark-energy (w0 , wa )20 , we follow\nthe prescription laid out by DETF [72].\nWe do not include any B-mode in our forecasts and assume no tensor mode contribution to the power spectra. We use the 100 GHz, 143 GHz, and 217 GHz channels as science\nchannels. These channels have a beam of \u03b8fwhm = 9.5\u2032 , \u03b8fwhm = 7.1\u2032 , and \u03b8fwhm = 5\u2032 ,\nrespectively, and sensitivities of \u03c3T = 2.5\u03bcK/K, \u03c3T = 2.2\u03bcK/K, \u03c3T = 4.8\u03bcK/K for\ntemperature, and \u03c3P = 4\u03bcK/K, \u03c3P = 4.2\u03bcK/K, \u03c3P = 9.8\u03bcK/K for polarisation, respectively. We take fsky = 0.80 as the sky fraction in order to account for galactic obstruction,\nand use a minimum l-mode lmin = 30 in order to avoid problems with polarisation foregrounds and not to include information from the late Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, which\ndepends on the specific dark-energy model. We discard temperature and polarisation data\nat l > 2000 to reduce sensitivity to contributions from patchy reionisation and point source\ncontamination (see [72] and references therein).\nWe assume a \u039bCDM fiducial cosmology, and choose the following set of parameters to describe the temperature and polarisation power spectra \u03b8~ = (\u03c9m , \u03c9b , \u03b6, 100 \u00d7\n\u03b8S , ln(1010 \u22062R (k0 )), nS , \u03c4 ), where \u03b8S is the angular size of the sound horizon at last scattering, and \u03c4 is the optical depth due to reionisation. Note that a different parameter set\nis assumed in [89].\nThe Fisher matrix for CMB power spectrum is given by [90, 91]:\nFijCM B =\n\nX X \u2202CX,l\n\u22121 \u2202CY,l\nCOVXY\n,\n\u2202\u03b8i\n\u2202\u03b8j\nl\n\n(A.1)\n\nX,Y\n\n20\n\nOn the contrary, using (w0 , wa ) as model parameters to compute the CMB Fisher matrix could artificially break exiting degeneracies.\n\n\u2013 29 \u2013\n\n\fwhere \u03b8i are the parameters to constrain, CX,l is the harmonic power spectrum for the\ntemperature-temperature (X \u2261 T T ), temperature-E-polarisation (X \u2261 T E) and the Epolarisation-E-polarisation (X \u2261 EE) power spectrum. The covariance COV\u22121\nXY of the\nerrors for the various power spectra is given by the fourth moment of the distribution,\nwhich under Gaussian assumptions is entirely given in terms of the CX,l with\nCOVT,T = fl CT,l + WT\u22121 Bl\u22122\n\n\u00012\n\n(A.2)\n\n\u00012\nWP\u22121 Bl\u22122\n\nCOVE,E = fl CE,l +\nh\nCOVT E,T E = fl CT2 E,l +\n\n\u0001\n\u22122\n\nCT,l + WT\u22121 Bl\n\nCOVT,E = fl CT2 E,l\nCOVT,T E =\nCOVE,T E =\n\n(A.3)\n(A.4)\n\u0001i\n\u22122\n\nCE,l + WP\u22121 Bl\n\nfl CT E,l CT,l + WT\u22121 Bl\u22122\n\u0001\nfl CT E,l CE,l + WP\u22121 Bl\u22122\n\u0001\n\n(A.5)\n(A.6)\n\n,\n\n(A.7)\n\nP\n2\nc\nc\nc\nc\n\u22122 being the weight per\nwhere fl = (2l+1)f\n, WT,P =\nc WT,P , WT,P = (\u03c3T,P \u03b8fwhm )\nsky\nsolid angle for temperature and polarisation respectively, with a 1\u2013\u03c3 sensitivity per pixel\nc\nc\nextent, for each frequency channel c.
