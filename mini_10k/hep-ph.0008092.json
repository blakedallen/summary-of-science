We briefly review the status of rare radiative and semileptonic b \u2192\ns(\u03b3, l+ l\u2212 ), (l = e, \u03bc) decays. We discuss possible signatures of new physics in these\nmodes and emphazise the role of the exclusive channels. In particular, measurements\nof the Forward-Backward asymmetry in B \u2192 K \u2217 l+ l\u2212 decays and its zero provide a\nclean test of the Standard Model, complementary to studies in b \u2192 s\u03b3 decays. Further,\nthe Forward-Backward CP asymmetry in B \u2192 K \u2217 l+ l\u2212 decays is sensitive to possible non-standard sources of CP violation mediated by flavor changing neutral current\nZ-penguins.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nFlavor changing neutral current (FCNC) b decays do not occur at tree level in\nthe Standard Model (SM). Being loop induced, they feel scales of order O(mW , mt )\nand in principle much higher ones, making them important probes of the flavor\nsector of the SM and beyond.\nRare radiative b \u2192 s\u03b3 decays proceed via so-called electromagnetic penguins.\nThey have been measured in exclusive B \u2192 K \u2217 \u03b3 [1] and inclusive B \u2192 Xs \u03b3 [2,3]\ndecays. In dilepton channels b \u2192 sl+ l\u2212 (l = e, \u03bc), we identify two additional\nstructures in the Feynman diagrams: boxes and Z-penguins. None of the dilepton\nmodes has been detected to date, but we expect large data samples from operating B-factories (CLEO,BaBar,Belle), dedicated B-physics programmes at colliders\n(Tevatron Run II,Hera-B) and LHC-B in the long term. Corresponding b \u2192 d\ntransition amplitudes are CKM suppressed Vtd\u2217 /Vts\u2217 \u221d \u03bb \u223c 0.22.\nThe existing best bound in the dimuon channels for inclusive decays is B(B \u2192\nXs \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ) < 5.8 * 10\u22125 at 90% C.L. [4], which is one order of magnitude above\nthe NLO SM expectation B(B \u2192 Xs \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 )SM = 5.7 \u00b1 1.1 * 10\u22126 [5]. Note that\nthe NNLO calculation in b \u2192 sl+ l\u2212 is only partially available [6]. Corresponding\nbounds for the exclusive channels are B(B + \u2192 K + \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ) < 5.2 * 10\u22126 , B(B 0 \u2192\n1)\n\nWork supported by the Department of Energy, Contract DE-AC03-76SF00515\n\n\fK \u22170 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ) < 4.0 * 10\u22126 at 90% C.L. [7] and their respective SM predictions are\nB(B \u2192 K\u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 )SM = 5.9 \u00b1 2.1 * 10\u22127 , B(B \u2192 K \u2217 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 )SM = 2.0 \u00b1 0.7 * 10\u22126\nwith the dominant theoretical uncertainty resulting from hadronic matrix elements,\nwhich are estimated here using Light cone sum rules [8]. Currently, the exclusive\nB \u2192 K \u2217 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 decay has the most interesting bound, which is only a factor of 2\naway from the SM prediction. Despite larger theoretical uncertainty than in the\ninclusive cases, rare exclusive decays are more accessible experimentally in the near\nfuture and have observables (e.g. existence and position of the zero of the ForwardBackward asymmetry discussed below), which are as clean as the respective ones\nin the inclusive modes.\n\nMODEL INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS\nPHOTON AND Z PENGUINS\nThe calculational tool for the description of b \u2192 s(\u03b3, l+ l\u2212 ) decays is the low\nP\nenergy effective Hamiltonian Hef f \u223c GF Vts\u2217 Vtb 10\ni=1 Ci (\u03bc)Oi (\u03bc) [9]. This enables\nthe analysis of relevant observables in a model independent way, with the goal\nbeing to extract the Wilson coefficients Ci from data [10]. The mayor player is the\nbs\u03b3 vertex O7 \u223c mb s\u0304L \u03c3\u03bc\u03bd bR F \u03bc\u03bd . Its effective coupling strength C7ef f is related to\nthe branching ratio B(B \u2192 Xs \u03b3) \u223c |C7ef f |2 thus 0.25 \u2264 |C7ef f | \u2264 0.37 [2,8] which is\nin good agreement with the SM value C7ef f |SM = \u22120.31 at \u03bc = mb at leading log.\nWe see that the b \u2192 s\u03b3 data fix the modulus of C7ef f , but not its sign (phase).\nIn b \u2192 sl+ l\u2212 decays, in addition to O7 , also 4-Fermi operators involving dileptons\ncontribute, given by O9 \u223c s\u0304L \u03b3 \u03bc bL l\u0304\u03b3\u03bc l, O10 \u223c s\u0304L \u03b3 \u03bc bL l\u0304\u03b3\u03bc \u03b35 l. Due to the charge\nassignments of lepton-Z couplings the Z-penguin contribution to C9 is suppressed\nwith respect to C10 by (l\u0304lZ|V )/(l\u0304lZ|A ) = \u22121+4 sin2 \u03b8W \u223c \u22120.08. We thus identify\nC10 as a measure of the sZb coupling modulo the box contribution [11].\nDecomposition of the B \u2192 K \u2217 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 branching ratio yields B = a|C7ef f |2 +b|C9 |2 +\nc|C10 |2 + dC7ef f C9 + eC7ef f + f C9 + g [8]. Using the CDF bound [7] on this mode and\nallowing C7ef f to have both SM-like and SM-opposite signs gives the present best\nbound on the strength of generic FCNC Z-penguins of |C10 | \u2264 10, which is a factor\nof 2-3 larger than the SM value C10 |SM = \u22124.7 [11]. Scenarios with non-standard\nZ-penguins arise in many extensions of the SM like such as supersymmetry, 4th\ngeneration and Z \u2032 [11]. Another interesting possibility to test the sZb vertex arises\nin b \u2192 s\u03bd \u03bd\u0304 decays, since here no photon penguins contribute.\n\nEXCLUSIVE B \u2192 K, K \u2217l+ l\u2212 DECAYS\nSupersymmetric effects in inclusive b \u2192 sl+ l\u2212 decays have been studied in\n[12,13]. The reach of a new physics search in the dilepton invariant mass distribution in B \u2192 K \u2217 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 decays is exemplified in Fig. 1 [8]. Supergravity (SUGRA)\n\n\f(dotted) and a supersymmetric scenario with non-minimal sources of flavor violation in the mass insertion approximation (dashed), can be well discriminated\nfrom the SM (solid) and its hadronic uncertainties (shaded area); the upper curves\ncontain resonant cc\u0304 background via B \u2192 K \u2217 \u03a8i \u2192 K \u2217 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 , lower ones are pure\nshort-distance contributions [14]. Note that the dashed curve saturates the experimental bound in this channel. Similar findings are valid for B \u2192 K\u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 decays,\nwhich however show less sensitivity to C7ef f as the photon pole at s = 0 is absent. In\neither case C7ef f > 0 (opposite-to-SM sign) enhances the rates through constructive\ninterference of C7ef f with C9 .\n\nForward-Backward Asymmetry\nThe Forward-Backward asymmetry in B \u2192 K \u2217 l+ l\u2212 decays results from V/A\ninterference in the lepton pair A(s) \u223c C10 (C7ef f + \u03b2(s)Re(C9ef f )), shown in Fig. 2\n[8]; see [11] for a discussion of the sign of A, which is opposite to the ForwardBackward asymmetry \u0100 of the CP conjugate channel in the CP conserving limit.\nIn the SM (C7ef f < 0, solid curve), A has a zero around s0 \u223c 3GeV2 , which would\ndisappear if C7ef f would have the opposite sign (long-short-dashed curve). The\nexistence of a zero in the Forward-Backward asymmetry in B \u2192 K \u2217 l+ l\u2212 decays\nbelow the J/\u03a8 resonance is an important test of the SM and is independent of\nhadronic matrix elements [8]. Positive C7ef f occurs generically in supersymmetric\n\nFIGURE 1. Dilepton invariant mass spectrum in B \u2192 K \u2217 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 decays. Figure taken from [8].\n\n\ftheories [12], but only for large tan\u03b2 in relaxed and/or minimal SUGRA [13].\nFurther, the position of the zero s0 has very small hadronic uncertainties [15].\nIn the limit where the final hadron has large energy, i.e., small dilepton mass, the\nLarge Energy Effective Theory [16] is applicable and here all form factors cancel\nout in the ratios which determines s0 [8].\nA recently proposed observable, the Forward-Backward CP asymmetry F BCP in\nB \u2192 K \u2217 l+ l\u2212 decays probes the phase of C10 or of the sZb vertex [11], respectively.\nDefined as F BCP \u2261 (A + \u0100)/(A \u2212 \u0100) = ImC10 /ReC10 ImC9ef f /ReC9ef f (1 + . . .),\nits magnitude scales with ImC9ef f = ImY , where Y (s) contains contributions from\nresonant and non-resonant cc\u0304 states [14]; ImY = 0 below threshold, so it is sizeable\nonly in the high dilepton mass region. Integration over m2\u03a8\u2032 < s \u2264 (mB \u2212 mK\u2217 )2\nyields \u2206F BCP = (3 \u00b1 1)%ImC10 /ReC10 , which can be large in the case of O(1)\nphases. Hadronic uncertainties are not small, but the SM background is below 10\u22123\nand any effect above this would be due to a non-SM source of CP violation [11].\n\nRADIATIVE RARE B-DECAYS\nThe SM branching ratio in B \u2192 Xs \u03b3 decays is known at NLO with 10 % accuracy\n0.00 0.26\n\u22124\nB(B \u2192 Xs \u03b3) = (3.32 \u00b10.00\n[17].

It is very tiny\nin the SM since aCP \u221d \u03b1s (mb )\u03b7\u03bb2 , \u03b7, \u03bb are Wolfenstein parameters, thus aCP \u2264 1%\n[18]. However, large effects of (10-50) % are possible in scenarios with an enhanced\nchromo-magnetic dipole operator C8 in the bsg vertex. CP asymmetry in exclusive\nB \u2192 K \u2217 \u03b3 \u2217decays has a less clean prediction due to strong phases, however, in the\nB\u2192K \u03b3\nSM, aCP\n\u2264 O(1%) holds [19]. Any significant deviation from this would signal\nB\u2192Xs \u03b3\nnew physics. In both inclusive \u22120.09 < aCP\n< 0.42 [2] and exclusive cases\nB\u2192K \u2217 \u03b3\naCP\n= (8 \u00b1 13 \u00b1 3)% [1], the measurements are not conclusive yet.\n\nSUMMARY\nTheoretically clear signatures of possible new physics can be experimentally isolated in b \u2192 s\u03b3 and b \u2192 sl+ l\u2212 decays in the near future via the observables\n(A(s0 ), F BCP , aCP ). It is exciting to see whether the SM passes this next round of\nFCNC tests.\n\nREFERENCES\n1. T.E.Coan et al., (CLEO Collaboration), Phys.Rev.Lett. 84 (2000) 5283.\n2. M.S.
