En particulier je tiens\n\u00e0 exprimer ma reconnaissance \u00e0 Pascal Debu, Philippe Schwemling et Witold Krasny pour avoir\ndispens\u00e9 avec parcimonie toutes injonctions pour rattraper ce l\u00e9ger retard que j'accusais ce qui m'aura\npermis de parachever ma th\u00e8se en toute qui\u00e9tude. Enfin je tiens \u00e0 remercier Stefan Tapprogge\net Fabian Zomer pour avoir accept\u00e9 d'en \u00eatre les rapporteurs et pour avoir studieusement pris en\nconsid\u00e9ration mon travail pendant leurs vacances de No\u00ebl. Cette gratitude s'adresse par ailleurs aux\nautres membres du jury, Michael Joyce, Tom LeCompte, Gavin Salam et mon directeur.\nJe remercie ce dernier, Mieczyslaw Witold Krasny, pour m'avoir offert l'opportunit\u00e9 de faire ma\nth\u00e8se avec lui et surtout pour avoir su composer, \u00e0 la faveur de mes capacit\u00e9s et de mes aspirations,\nun sujet de th\u00e8se idoine \u00e0 ma d\u00e9licate personne. Par bien des aspects travailler sous sa direction\nsur le pr\u00e9sent sujet fit largement honneur au travail de recherche tel que l'on peut se le figurer dans\nl'id\u00e9al. Ces remerciements ne sauraient rendre justice \u00e0 ce que furent ces trois derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es en\nsa compagnie si je ne devais mentionner sa sympathie, sa bienveillance et pour ne m'avoir jamais\nmis sous pression favorisant en cela le plaisir dans le travail \u00e0 la production de r\u00e9sultats \u00e9quivoques.\nEnfin l'originalit\u00e9 du personnage, \u00e0 mi-chemin entre le diable de Tasmanie et le \"road-runner\", son\ng\u00e9nie ainsi que son humour ont fait de cette collaboration une exp\u00e9rience unique.\nJust like to fire there is water, or to vodka there is mi\u00f3d pitny to Witold Krasny there is Wieslaw\nPlaczek. On many aspects I consider Wieslaw Placzek as my second supervisor for all of his helps\nwhich improved the quality of my work over these last years. I learned a lot from his rigor, his\ninfallible skills in informatics and I am indebted for all the multiple times he helped me using the\nWINHAC Monte Carlo. Besides I always appreciated his zen attitude and I also do not forget that\nmost of my stays in Krak\u00f3w would not have been possibly that smooth if it had not been for his\nattentions and his hospitality. Za wszystko dzi\u0229kuj\u0229 Ci polski mistrzu Zen.\nI am deeply grateful to Giorgos Stavropoulos whose help and support, while fighting with Athena,\nallowed me to reach my first concrete results in my thesis. His broad sympathy really made of this\ntask an agreeable moment, which, in regard of what Athena is, stands as a huge compliment.\nJestem wdzi\u0229czny Andrzejowi Si\u00f3dmokowi. Indeed, Andrzej brought equilibrium to tackle the\nKrasny\u2013Placzek doublet which would have been hard to tame all by myself (especially the M.W.K.\ncomponent), besides I am grateful to him for his sympathy and his hospitality in Krak\u00f3w. I also\ndo not forget Katarzyna Rejzner whose recent arrival in our team brought additional fun and more\nimportantly allowed to decrease the amount of krasnic activity Andrzej and I used to deal with.\nJe remercie les membres du groupe ATLAS du LPNHE pour leur accueil et plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Derue pour s'\u00eatre montr\u00e9 toujours disponible pour m'aider lors de mes confrontations nonASCII avec Athena ainsi qu'Emmanuel Busato dont les aides, m\u00eame apr\u00e8s son d\u00e9part pour Clermont\u2013\nFerrand, auront grandemement contribuer \u00e0 am\u00e9liorer la qualit\u00e9 de mon code.

Je double\nmes louanges \u00e0 l'endroit de Rui et Jers dont les aides en Matplotlib auront contribuer \u00e0 am\u00e9liorer la\nfacture de ce document. Je triple mes louanges \u00e0 Mini Manu pour tout le temps qu'il m'aura accord\u00e9\npour r\u00e9soudre les obstacles techniques qui se sont dress\u00e9s sur mon chemin.

Jers enfin qui, outre toutes les\naides en informatiques, m'aura prodigu\u00e9 \u00e0 maintes reprises l'occasion de rire de bon coeur.\nI thank the members of the ATLAS group of the Institute of Nuclear Physics in Krak\u00f3w for\ntheir hospitality during my several stays amongst them, in particular Jolanta Olszowska and Janusz\n\n\fChwastowski. I am grateful to the nice fellows I met in Krak\u00f3w with whom I shared nice moments\nespecially Zofia Czyczula, Ewa Stanecka, Adam Matyja, Sebastian Sapeta, Hayk and Meri. I have also\na thought for all the poles from CERN especially Justyna and Janek. Enfin de mani\u00e8re plus g\u00e9n\u00e9rale\nje rends hommage au peuple Polonais pour son accueil et son savoir-vivre. Depuis les charmantes\npolonaises callipyges aux vieillards vout\u00e9s par les ans en passant par les vendeurs ambulants de\npierogi et de vodka c'est toujours avec grande courtoisie, force d\u00e9licatesse et patience non feinte que\nl'on m'aura consid\u00e9r\u00e9. Ce faisant, tous mes s\u00e9jours \u00e0 Cracovie, sans exception, furent autant de\npauses \"civilisation\" qui auront \u00e9maill\u00e9es les vicissitudes inh\u00e9rentes \u00e0 la vie parisienne.\nI would like to greet the people from the CERN Standard Model forum especially, Lucia DiCiacco,\nNathalie Besson, Stefan Tapprogge, Thomas Nunneneman, Maarten Boonekamp and Troels Petersen.\nSpecial thanks to Tom LeCompte for sharing his experience with a guenuine vivid and communicative\nenthusiasm. I am also grateful to the following people with whom I had positive exchanges : David\nRousseau, Andrea Dell'Acqua, Wojciech Wojcik, Pawel Br\u00fcckman de Restrom, Mike Whalley, Borut\nKersevan, Kristin Lohwasser, Fred Olness, Muge Karagoz Unel, Chris Hay, Ashutosh Kotwal, Mark\nLancaster and Arkadiuz Weinstein.\nJe suis reconnaissant \u00e0 Benoit Loiseau pour son attention quant au bon d\u00e9roulement de ma\nth\u00e8se et je l'associe aussi \u00e0 ma gratitude envers Bertrand Desplanques tous deux m'ayant permis de\ntrouver asile scientifique \u00e0 Grenoble lorsque je m'\u00e9tais mis en d\u00e9licatesse avec une partie du milieu\nacad\u00e9mique parisien. Outre le sauvetage d'un avenir potentiel dans les sciences, les explications de\nBertrand Desplanques au cours de mon stage sous sa direction m'auront apport\u00e9es beaucoup dans\nmon approche actuelle vis-\u00e0-vis de la physique des particules.\nJe remercie aussi mes coll\u00e8gues du LPTHE : Matteo Cacciari, gran maestro di quark pesanti, pour\nle stage sous sa direction et pour m'avoir toujours fait profiter des ses explications limpides pendant le\nd\u00e9but de ma th\u00e8se quand mon esprit penait \u00e0 se calibrer sur le mode de pens\u00e9e polonais, Gavin Salam\npour ses aides efficaces et pour sa relecture de mon manuscrit enfin Bruno Machet pour sa grande\nbont\u00e9, son enthousiasme et toutes ces agr\u00e9ables discussions qui, faisant \u00e9cho aux discours de mes\nautres mentors, m'auront permis d'\u00e9largir mon ouverture d'esprit.

I cherish all these nice moments I\nshared with them in Krak\u00f3w and thank them for the basics in polish they learned me, short, but yet\nenough to get myself into trouble.\nJe rends un hommage particulier \u00e0 Pascal Parneix dont la passion pour la physique et l'\u00e9nergie mise\n\u00e0 son service auront marqu\u00e9 une partie de mes \u00e9tudes universitaires, pour ce stage bien sympathique\npass\u00e9 sous sa direction ainsi que pour ses conseils et ses aides dans les moments difficiles.\nJe remercie Alain \"Docteur Folamour\" Mazeyrat pour son soutien dans les passages \u00e0 vide et\nsalue sa dext\u00e9rit\u00e9 qui sauva une carte m\u00e8re dont la perte aurait grandement fait d\u00e9faut \u00e0 mon travail.\nMerci aussi \u00e0 Jean On\u00e9sippe pour son aide, son \u00e9coute et pour avoir distill\u00e9 un peu de sa grande\nsagesse antillaise dans mon esprit inquiet.

It is believed not to be the most fundamental description but\nrather a phenomenological approximation for energies below the TeV scale. In this model, two types\nof particles are to be distinguished. First are the quarks and leptons building up the matter and,\nsecond, are the bosons that mediate the interactions among them. Of all the four known fundamental\ninteractions \u2013the gravitation, electromagnetic, weak and strong interactions\u2013 only the last three are\nnow implemented within the mathematical formalism supporting the Standard Model. Amid these\ninteractions the weak one, acting on both quarks and leptons, is mediated by the exchange of the\nmassive neutral Z and two charged W \u00b1 bosons. The W + and W \u2212 , which are antiparticle of each\nother, are the object of interest in this dissertation.\nThe Z boson has been observed in 1973 in the Gargamelle bubble chamber at CERN while the\nW \u00b1 bosons were observed in single production in 1983 in the UA1 detector of the Super Proton\nSynchrotron (SPS) p p\u0304 collider, again at CERN. This discovery confirmed the Glashow\u2013Weinberg\u2013\nSalam electroweak model. Since then, the W \u00b1 have been studied for the last decades at the Large\nElectron Positron (LEP) e+ e\u2212 collider (W + W \u2212 pair production) and at the Tevatron p p\u0304 collider\n(single W production). These two experiments allowed to measure W properties such as its mass\nMW or its width \u0393W . These parameters are important since they provide, when combined to other\nStandard Model parameters, constraints on the Standard Model. For example the masses of the W\nand of the top quark constrain the mass of the hypothetical Higgs boson. The specific W study\nof this work aims at improving the experimental value of the charge asymmetry of the W mass by\nstudying single W production at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). This measurement has so far\nnot received much attention and, as a consequence, displays an accuracy 10 times larger than the\none on the absolute mass MW . With the new possibilities that the LHC p p collider should offer for\nthe next years we considered the prospect for a drastic decrease of the experimental error on the\nMW + \u2212 MW \u2212 value using the ATLAS multipurpose detector capabilities. The first motivation for\nsuch a measurement is to refine the confirmation of the CP T invariance principle through the direct\nmeasurement of the W \u00b1 masses, to complete the accurate CP T test made by observing charged\n\u03bc+ and \u03bc\u2212 life time decays. Other motivations will be given later. Besides, as it will be shown,\nthe W bosons, despite the fact they will be produced with the same process as at the SPS and\nthe Tevatron colliders, will nonetheless display original kinematics due to the nature of the colliding\nbeams. Indeed, while W + and W \u2212 are produced on the same footing in p p\u0304 collision, this will not\nbe the case anymore at the LHC. The first step of this work is to understand the W + and W \u2212\nkinematics in p p collisions. After, this first stage providing all cards in our hands to understand the\n\n\f12\n\nIntroduction\n\nW properties at the LHC, the rest of this work will focus on the improvement that could be provided\nto the MW + \u2212 MW \u2212 measurement using the ATLAS detector at the LHC. Here, rather than reusing\nTevatron tactics, we devised new strategies specific to this measurement and to the LHC/ATLAS\ncontext. The philosophy for these strategies \u2013as it will be detailed\u2013 aims at being as independent as\npossible of both phenomenological and experimental uncertainties, that cannot be fully controlled.\nEventually, we argue that the proposed strategies, could enhance the actual accuracy on MW + \u2212MW \u2212\nby a factor of \u2248 20.\nThis work represents the second stage of a series of several publications aiming at providing\nprecision measurement strategies of the electroweak parameters for the upcoming LHC era. In the\nsame logic, next steps will provide dedicated strategies for the measurement of the absolute mass and\nwidth of the W boson.\nThis work is the result of three years of collaboration in a team consisting of Mieczyslaw Witold\nKrasny, Wieslaw Placzek, Andrzej Si\u00f3dmok and the author. Furthermore, the technical work that\ntook place within the ATLAS software was made possible with substantial help from Giorgos Stavropoulos.\n\n\fChapter 1\n\nPhenomenological context and\nmotivations\n- Depuis lors, continua Aramis, je vis agr\u00e9ablement.

The first part reviews in a nutshell\nthe Standard Model which is the present paradigm to describe the elementary particles and their\ninteractions. Then, a parenthesis is made on the experimental setting to already provide to the\nreader the global vision necessary to understand the rest of the Chapter. For this purpose, the\nhadronic production of W bosons and how their properties are extracted from leptonic decays are\nreviewed. Next, motivations for the measurement of the W mass charge asymmetry are given.\nThe second part introduces the notations and conventions used throughout the document.\nThe third part describes the phenomenological formalism used to study W bosons produced\nin hadronic collisions and decaying into leptons, phenomenon also known as production of W in\nDrell\u2013Yan-like processes. This presentation, rather than being exhaustive, emphasises the relevant\nkinematics needed to understand the gist of W physics in Drell\u2013Yan-like processes and how, from\nsuch kinematics, the W properties like its mass and its width are extracted.\nFinally the Chapter closes on a presentation of the rest of the document.\n\n1.1\n1.1.1\n\nThe Standard Model in a nutshell\nOverview\n\nBased on the experience that seemingly different phenomena can eventually be interpreted with the\nsame laws, physicists came up with only four interactions to describe all known physics processes\nin our Universe. They are the gravitational, electromagnetic, weak and strong interactions. The\nelectromagnetic, weak and strong interactions are described at the subatomic level by Quantum\nField Theory (QFT), the theoretical framework that emerges when encompassing the features of both\nSpecial Relativity and Quantum Mechanics. In particular the weak and electromagnetic interactions\nare now unified in QFT into the Glashow\u2013Weinberg\u2013Salam electroweak theory. The description of the\nthree interactions in QFT is called the Standard Model of elementary particles and their interactions,\n\n\f14\n\nPhenomenological context and motivations\nFermions\nQuarks\n\nLeptons\n\n1st generation\n\n2nd generation\n\n3nd generation\n\nQ\n\nu (up)\n\nc (charm)\n\nt (top)\n\n+2/3\n\nd (down)\n\ns (strange)\n\nb (bottom)\n\n\u22121/3\n\ne\u2212 (electron)\n\n\u03bc\u2212 (muon)\n\n\u03c4 \u2212 (tau)\n\n\u03bde (electron neutrino)\n\n\u03bd\u03bc (muon neutrino)\n\n\u03bd\u03c4 (tau neutrino)\n\n\u22121\n0\n\nTable 1.1: The three generations of quarks and leptons. Q is the electrical charge.\n\nor simply Standard Model (SM). The \"Standard\" label means that it is the present day reference,\nwhich, although not believed to be the ultimate truth, is not yet contradicted by data. This amends\nfor the term \"phenomenology\" used in some applications in the SM, where phenomena are described\nwith non fundamental models and, hence, non fundamental parameters. Gravity, on the other hand,\nis not yet implemented in QFT, it is described by General Relativity. It mostly concerns Cosmology,\nthat rules the behaviour of space\u2013time geometry under the influence of massive bodies and in noninertial frames. It explains the structure of the Universe and its components on large scales, and\neventually leads to the Big Bang theory. In the Standard Model, the effects of gravity are negligible\nas long as the energies stay below the Planck scale (< 1019 GeV).\nBefore presenting the Standard Model in more details we present an overview of the particles\nproperties and denominations. At this stage, we already adopt natural units where c = 1 and\n~ = 1. Table 1.1 displays the elementary (i.e. structureless) particles building the matter. They\nare fermions1 of spin S = 1/2 and come in two types, the quarks and the leptons, both present\nin three generations of doublets : this leads to six different flavours of quarks or leptons. The only\nthing that differentiates each generation is the masses of the particles [1]. Quarks have fractional\nelectrical charge \u2013with respect to the charge e of the electron\u2013 and are sensitive to all interactions.\nCharged leptons are sensitive to the weak and electromagnetic interactions, while neutral leptons\n(neutrinos) are only sensitive to the weak interaction. Interactions among all fermions are due to\nthe exchange of elementary particles of boson type. The electromagnetic interaction is mediated by\nthe exchange of neutral massless photons \u03b3 between all particles that have an electrical charge. The\nweak interaction is mediated by three massive vector bosons : the electrically charged W + and W \u2212\nand the electrically neutral Z. All particles bearing a weak isospin charge are sensitive to the weak\ninteraction. The strong interaction between particles having a color charge is mediated by massless\ncolored gluons g of eight different kinds.\nThe quarks and leptons were discovered on a time scale that span no less than a century. The\nelectron was observed at the end of the 19th century [2, 3, 4] while the muon and tau were observed\nrespectively in the thirties [5] and the seventies [6]. The electron neutrino \u03bde was found in the\nfifties [7], the \u03bd\u03bc ten years later [8] and the \u03bd\u03c4 after another forty years later [9]. The up, down and\nstrange quarks were observed in hadrons in the deep inelastic electron\u2013nucleon and neutrino\u2013nucleon\nscattering experiments [10, 11]. The discovery of the charmed quark occurred in the seventies [12, 13],\nthe bottom was discovered a few years later [14], while the top, due to its very large mass, was\ndiscovered in the nineties at the Tevatron p p\u0304 collider [15, 16]. Concerning the gauge bosons, the\nphoton was discovered with the theoretical interpretation of the photo-electric effect [17] while the\nW \u00b1 and Z bosons were isolated in p p\u0304 collisions [18, 19, 20, 21]. The existence of gluons was deduced\nfrom the observation of hadronic jets generated in e+ e\u2212 collisions at high energies [22, 23, 24].\nEach particle mentioned so far has its own anti-particle with opposite quantum numbers. Antiparticles of electrically charged particles are noted with the opposite sign of the charge (e.g. e+ is the\n1\n\nFermion is the generic term used to qualify all particles whose spin is a \"half-value\" of the Planck constant, i.e.\nn in units of ~, n being an integer. Boson on the other hand qualifies particles whose spin is an integer of the Planck\nconstant.\n1\n2\n\n\f1.1 The Standard Model in a nutshell\n\n15\n\nanti-particle of e\u2212 ) while neutral particles are noted with a bar upon them (e.g. \u03bd\u0304l is the anti-particle\nof \u03bdl ). Some particles are their own anti-particles, e.g. the photon and the Z boson. The rest of this\nsection presents the main features of the Standard Model. First, a glimpse at QFT is given, then we\ndescribe the electromagnetic, strong and weak interactions in QFT.\n\n1.1.2\n\nThe theoretical background of the Standard Model : Quantum Field Theory\n\nThe beginning of the 20th century witnessed the emergence of two revolutions in physics : Quantum\nMechanics and Special Relativity. Quantum Mechanics deals with phenomena below the atomic scale\nwhile Special Relativity, based on space\u2013time homogeneity/isotropy, describes laws of transformations\nbetween inertial frames. Exploring deeper the subatomic world, the Heisenberg principle entails that,\nas the length scale decreases, the momentum (energy) increases. This increase of the energy amends\nfor the High Energy Physics (HEP) terminology used to refer to the elementary particles and their\ninteractions. In those conditions, taking into account Special Relativity is mandatory.\nThe Klein\u2013Gordon and Dirac equations were the first relativistic generalisations of the Schr\u00f6dinger\nequation. The problem with these equations is that they have negative energies solutions which are\ndifficult to interpret. This problem can be overcome if one considers that a negative energy solution\ndescribes an anti-particle. An anti-particle can be interpreted as a positive energy particle travelling\nbackward in time. Besides, in this relativistic and quantum context, a solution describes a quantum\nfield \u03c8 whose elementary excitations are the particles. Then, the number of particles is no longer\nfixed and the relativistic mass\u2013energy equivalence accounts for the annihilation/creation of pairs of\nparticle\u2013anti-particle. This new framework is the Quantum Field Theory.\nQFT describes local interactions of supposedly point-like particles. It bears its own difficulties,\nwith the arising of infinities, which need to be consistently taken care of in the process of renormalisation. Taking into account local Lorentz invariant QFT with the spin\u2013statistic theorem leads to the\nCP T symmetry, i.e. the conservation the product of the charge conjugation C, parity P and time\ninversion T operators in any processes. In particular, CP T symmetry shows that MW + = MW \u2212 .\nOne method to quantify a field is to use the Feynman path integral. Path integral formulation of\nQuantum Mechanics relies on a generalisation of the least action principle of classical mechanics. It\nis based on the Lagrangian density from which the equations of the dynamics can be deduced. The\nLagrangian density (called hereafter Lagrangian) of the field under study contains its kinetic and\npotential energies. Hence, the description of the dynamics of elementary particles under the influence\nof fundamental forces consists to formulate the right Lagrangian with : (1) the kinetic energy of the\nfree fields of the spin- 12 quarks/leptons and of the spin-1 bosons mediators and (2) the potential\nterm displaying their mutual interactions and \u2013if any\u2013 the bosonic field self-interaction terms. A\nterm of interaction is proportional to a coupling constant, say gint. , inherent to the interaction under\nstudy. Up to the fact that this constant is small enough, the calculus of the amplitude of probability\ncan be developed into a perturbative expansion in powers of the coupling constant gint. . All terms\nn in the expansion involve processes with n interaction points (vertices) between\nproportional to gint.\nquarks/leptons and bosons. We can associate to them drawings, called Feynman diagrams. Each one\nentangles all processes sharing the same topological representation in momentum space.\nFinally let us mention that QFT is also extensively used in condensed matter physics, in particular\nin many-body problems, and the interplay of ideas between this domain and HEP is very rich. With\nthe basics features of QFT presented above we now describe the electromagnetic, strong and weak\ninteractions.\n\n1.1.3\n\nQuantum Electrodynamics\n\nThe theory that describes the electromagnetic interactions in QFT is called Quantum Electrodynamics\n(QED). The Lagrangian of QED includes the Dirac and Maxwell Lagrangians respectively to describe\nthe kinetic energy of, say, the free electron field \u03c8 (its excitation are the electrons) and of the free\ngauge field A\u03bc (its excitation are the photons). It also contains an interaction term between the\n\n\f16\n\nPhenomenological context and motivations\n\nphoton and electron fields which is proportional to e, the charge of the electron. The charge e is\nlinked \u03b1, the fine structure constant of QED, via \u03b1 \u2261 e2 /4 \u03c0. Since \u03b1 \u2248 1/137 the expansion in\npower of \u03b1 is feasible. Still, when taking into account Feynman diagrams with loops, i.e. quantum\nfluctuations involving particles with arbitrary four-momenta, the calculus diverges. This reflects\nthe conflict between the locality of the interactions inherited from Special Relativity and Quantum\nMechanics that allows virtual processes to have arbitrary high energies. Divergences come from terms\nlike ln(\u039b/m), where \u039b is a temporary unphysical cut-off parameter and m the mass of the electron.\nThe procedure to get rid of those divergences is called renormalisation. It consists in redefining\nthe fundamental parameters of the theory by realising that the charge e used so far is already the\none resulting from all quantum loops. These e+ e\u2212 loops affect the value of the bare charge e0 that\none would observe if there was no interaction. Expressing in a perturbative series e as a function of\ne0 and \u039b and, then, writing in the expression of the amplitude e0 as a function of e allows to get rid\nof the divergences when \u039b \u2192 +\u221e. The effect of these loops depends on the energy, for that reason a\nrenormalisation scale energy \u03bcr is chosen close to a characteristic energy scale in the process. Since\n\u03bcr is arbitrary the charge must obeys an equation expressing the invariance of physics with respect\nto \u03bcr . This leads to the formulation of the renormalisation equations. Eventually the e+ e\u2212 loops\nscreen the bare charge. Then, the charge e and mass of the electron, in our example, are no longer\nfundamental parameters but rather effective parameters (running coupling constants) which values\ndepends of \u03bcr .\nGauge invariance is an essential tool in proving the renormalisability of a gauge theory. For QED,\nit appears that equations are invariant under a local transformation of the phase factor of the field \u03c8.\nThe invariance of the Lagrangian under this particular transformation directly governs the properties\nof the electromagnetic interaction. Group theory allows to describe these properties, in the case\nof QED this group is U (1)QED . Consequent to those developments, physicists tried to describe the\nremaining interactions with the help of gauge invariant theories, too.\n\n1.1.4\n\nQuantum Chromodynamics\n\nThe description of the strong interaction by a gauge theory became sensible when the elementary\nstructure of the hadrons was discovered in lepton\u2013hadron deep inelastic scattering (DIS) experiments.\nThose experiments shed light on the partons, the hypothetical constituents of the hadrons, which\nbecome quasi free at high energies. The partons are of two types, the quarks and the gluons [25, 26]\nand, at first, the structure of the hadrons was found to satisfy some scaling properties.\nThe observation of hadrons made quarks of the same flavour and spin hinted at the existence\nof a new quantum number attached to quarks that could eventually help to anti-symmetrise the\nwave functions of such hadrons, and save the Fermi exclusion principle. It was then postulated that\nthe group describing the strong interaction is SU (3)c , where c stands for color. Indeed, in analogy\nwith the additive mixing of primary colors, quarks hold three primitive \"colors\" (\"red\", \"green\" and\n\"blue\") that, when combined, give \"white\" hadrons, which justifies the term of chromo in Quantum\nChromodynamics (QCD), the QFT model of the strong interaction [27, 28, 29]. This group is nonabelian which pragmatically implies that the interactions carriers, the gluons, are colored and can\ninteract among themselves, in addition to interacting with quarks. There are eight colored gluons to\nwhich we can associate the gauge field G\u03bca where a = 1, 2, . . . 8.\nThis last property implies striking differences with respect to QED. In addition to gluon\u2013quark\nvertices, equivalent to photon-lepton/quark vertices in QED, there are now three and four gluons\nvertices. During the renormalisation of the strong interaction coupling constant gs , while the quarks\nloops screen the color charge, the gluons loops magnifies it and eventually dominate. As a consequence\ngs , or equivalently \u03b1s \u2261 gs2 /4 \u03c0, is a decreasing function of the renormalisation energy \u03bcr . This justifies\na posteriori the asymptotic freedom hypothesis for the partons in DIS, and also, qualitatively, the\nconfinement of quarks in hadrons. Hence, at some point, when the energy involved in a QCD process\nbecomes small, \u03b1s gets large which prohibits the use of perturbative calculations. The energy scale\nmarking this frontier is of the order of 0.1 GeV. Below this limit, other techniques have to be employed\n\n\f1.1 The Standard Model in a nutshell\n\n17\n\nto make calculations (e.g. lattice QCD). Note, finally, that the change of \u03b1s with the energy implies\nthat the formerly observed scaling property must be violated, which was observed and formalised in\nparticular with DGLAP equations [30, 31, 32]. Note also that the renormalisation constraints impose\nto have as many quarks as there are leptons which twice allowed to predict new quarks : the charm\nto match, with the u, d and s, the two first leptons families and eventually the top and bottom quark\ndoublet when the tau lepton was discovered.\n\n1.1.5\n(a)\n\nElectroweak interactions\nWeak interactions and the path to the electroweak model\n\nThe weak interaction was discovered in nuclear \u03b2\u2013decay and recognised to drive as well the muon\ndecay. The first model was a point-like interaction involving charged currents (to account for the\nchange of flavor) and proportional to the Fermi constant GF . The peculiarity of this interaction is\nthat it violates parity, leading to the vector minus axial-vector (V \u2212 A) nature of the weak currents.\nHence, weak interactions couple only left-handed particles and right-handed anti-particles.\nThe problem of the Fermi model is that it collapses above \u2248 300 GeV by giving inconsistent\npredictions. Using unitarity constraints, one can shape the form of the more fundamental model\nruling the weak interactions. First, based on the previous examples of QED and QCD, the weak\ninteraction can be assumed to be mediated by the exchange of heavy charged vector bosons. In this\nnew context the propagator of the W boson damps the rise with energy. Assuming that the coupling\nstrength of the W to fermions is comparable to the one of QED, one finds that the mass of the W\nmust be around 100 GeV. Hence, due to the mass of the W the range of the weak interaction is of\nthe order of 1/MW .\nIn addition to charged currents the theory needs neutral currents as well. Let us consider, for\nexample, the process e+ e\u2212 \u2192 W + W \u2212 that occurs with an exchange of a neutrino. When the W\nbosons are produced with longitudinal polarisation their wave functions grows linearly with the energy\nwhile the exchange of a neutrino predicts a growth quadratic with the energy. To overpass this new\nbreakdown of unitarity a neutral boson, the Z, must take part in the process like e+ e\u2212 \u2192 Z \u2192\nW + W \u2212 with a tri-linear coupling to the W + and W \u2212 .\nA consequence of this tri-linear coupling is that, now, scattering of vector bosons can be observed.\nIn the case of W + W \u2212 \u2192 W + W \u2212 the amplitude of longitudinally polarised W bosons, built-up by\nthe exchange of Z, grows as the fourth power of the energy in the center of mass of the collision. This\nleading divergence is canceled by introducing a quadri-linear coupling among the weak bosons. Still,\nunitarity is not yet restored for asymptotic energies since the amplitude still grows quadratically with\nthe energy.\nAt this stage, two solutions can be envisaged. The scattering amplitude can be damped, either by\nintroducing strong interactions between the W bosons (technicolor model), or by introducing a new\nparticle, the scalar Higgs boson H, which interferes destructively with the exchange of weak bosons.\nWe have seen that the coupling strength of the weak and electromagnetic interactions are of the\nsame order. Besides we have seen that the road to preserve unitarity is very much linked to the\nhandling of longitudinally polarised W bosons. We now give a brief presentation of the electroweak\nmodel that unifies electromagnetic and weak interactions.\n(b)\n\nThe electroweak model\n\nSince weak interactions couple only left particles and right anti-particles, finding a gauge theory to\ncope with this implies that all elementary particles have to be considered, in a first approximation,\nto be massless. The path to the electroweak model can be presented in two steps. In the first\nstep, the Glashow\u2013Weinberg\u2013Salam (GWS) model [33, 34, 35] unifies the weak and electromagnetic\ninteractions up to the approximation that all quarks, leptons and vector bosons are massless, QCD\ncan be added along to the GWS model, still with massless particles. The second step describes the\n\n\f18\n\nPhenomenological context and motivations\n\nmechanism that allows massive particles without explicitly breaking the gauge invariance constructed\nearlier. This is the Brout\u2013Engler\u2013Higgs\u2013Kibble mechanism [36, 37, 38].\nThe fact that elementary fermions were found in doublets and the desire to unify the weak and\nelectromagnetic interactions in a gauge invariant theory led to the gauge groups SU (2)L \u2297 U (1)Y .\nThe SU (2)L takes into account the fact that left-handed fermions are found in weak isospin\ndoublet, i.e. I = 1/2 which, for the conventionally used third component, means I3 = \u00b11/2, while\nright-handed fermions are found in singlets. Let us note also that the left-handed quarks eigenstates\nin weak interactions differ from the mass eigenstates ; the convention tends toPwrite down the lower\nisospin states q 0 as linear combinations of the eigenstate masses q, like qi0 = j Vij qj , where i and\nj are the flavors of the quarks and the elements Vij are the elements of the Cabibbo\u2013Kobayashi\u2013\nMaskawa (CKM) [39, 40] 3 \u00d7 3 matrix. The non-abelian properties of the SU (2) group ensures that\nsome mediators of the interaction will have a charge and then will be assimilable to the W bosons.\nAt this stage, there are 3 fields, W 1,\u03bc , W 2,\u03bc and W 3,\u03bc that couples to particles with a weak isospin\nwith a coupling constant g.\nThe group U (1)Y , although different from U (1)QED , is chosen so that, eventually, some of its\ncomponents will give back QED. It governs the interaction of weakly hypercharged particles Y coupled\nto a gauge field B \u03bc via a coupling constant g 0 .\nIn this context one imposes the electric charge Q of a particle to be linked to the weak isospin and\nhypercharge via the Gell-Mann\u2013Nishijima equation : Q = 12 Y +I3 . Things can then be recast in terms\nof electric charge to purposely make the W bosons appear ; from the weak hypercharge and isospin\nterms we end up with three terms respectively displaying positively, negatively and neutrally charged\ncurrents. In this new basis the W bosons fields are linear combinations of the W 1,\u03bc and W 2,\u03bc . We\nare left with a neutral term involving the gauge fields B \u03bc and W 3,\u03bc . These fields, though, are not yet\nthe photon and the Z. In fact, the latter appear to be admixtures of B \u03bc and W 3,\u03bc . The angle that\ngoverns this mixture is called the Weinberg angle \u0398W . Weak and electromagnetic interactions are\nnow unified and described by three parameters : how they mix via \u0398W and their individual coupling\nstrength GF and \u03b1.\nLike mentioned previously QCD can be added such that three gauge theories finally account for\nthe three interactions, i.e. SU (3)c \u2297 SU (2)L \u2297 U (1)Y . Nonetheless this model presents a few flaws.\nThe problem of the unitarity above 300 GeV is partially fixed by introducing massive vector bosons\nbut the unitarity still breaks down around 1 TeV in W + W \u2212 \u2192 W + W \u2212 , where the W are polarised\nlongitudinally. Last but not least, some elementary particles are massive but if one enters mass terms\nexplicitly in the equations the gauge invariance is broken. To keep the gauge invariance properties\nof the GWS model and take into account the masses a mechanism that spontaneously breaks the\nsymmetry of the solutions had to be devised.\nThe solution was directly inspired by condensed matter physics, more precisely, from supraconductivity where photons can become massive due to the non-symmetric fundamental state of the\nscalar field (S = 0) describing electrons pairs. Here, the electroweak symmetry breaking (ESB) is\nrealised by adding to the previous model a Higgs scalar field which, to respect SU (2)L \u2297 U (1)Y ,\ncomes as a weak isospin doublet with an hypercharge. A part of the potential for the Higgs field is\nchosen so that the vacuum energy is degenerate. This complex Higgs doublet makes a total of four\ndegrees of freedom. Three of these degrees mix with the W \u00b1 and Z bosons and provide them with a\nthird longitudinal spin state which makes them massive while the remaining one becomes the massive\nHiggs boson. The fermions acquire their masses via Yukawa couplings with the Higgs field. The Higgs\nboson is the last missing piece of the present day formulation of the Standard Model. If it exists and\nif it perturbatively interacts, its experimental observation will validate the Standard Model.\n\n1.1.6\n\nSummary\n\nWe briefly presented the quantum and relativistic framework for the dynamics of the quarks and\nleptons sensitive to the electromagnetic, weak and strong interactions, as well as how massive particles\ngain their masses dynamically by interacting with the Higgs scalar field. The Standard Model has a\n\n\f1.2 The W mass charge asymmetry in the Standard Model\n\n19\n\nhighly predictive power in its actual form but its main problem still lies in the understanding of the\norigin and nature of the masses of the particles. Although the ESB mechanism accounts for them\nwhile respecting the gauge invariance, its addition is mainly ad hoc.\nThis summary of the Standard Model did not had the pretension to be exhaustive. In particular,\nthe wide variety of experiments, such as hadron\u2013hadron, lepton\u2013nucleon or electron\u2013positron colliders,\nthat provided essential results, were not credited to keep this presentation as short as possible. As a\nconsequence the reader is invited to refer to classical textbooks with more details and references to\nhistorical papers : for QFT/SM in order of accessibility Refs. [41, 42, 43, 44, 45], for details in QCD\nRef. [46] and in the Electroweak Model Ref. [47] for example.\n\n1.2\n1.2.1\n\nThe W mass charge asymmetry in the Standard Model\nA first overview from the experimental point of view\n\nThe present work takes place in the context of collider physics, more specifically within the Large\nHadron Collider (LHC) that should accelerate in a large ring counter-rotating hadrons\n\u221a \u2013most of the\ntime protons\u2013\nand\nmake\nthem\ncollide\nat\nseveral\ninteraction\npoints\nwith\nan\nenergy\nS in the center\n\u221a\nof mass of S = 14 TeV. The observation of the particles emerging from these hadronic collisions\nis achieved by several detectors located in the vicinity of the interaction points. Among them is the\nATLAS detector whose capabilities were used in this analysis. The LHC and the ATLAS detector\nwill be described in more details in the next Chapter. Also, worth mentioning, is the Tevatron which,\nfor the last decades before the LHC, has been the largest circular accelerator. The Tevatron\ncollider\n\u221a\naccelerates counter rotating protons and anti-protons at energies in the center of mass of S \u2248 2 TeV.\nAmid all the difficulties entering such experimental analysis, two are to be noticed. The first,\ninherent to high energy physics, is that most of the exotic particles cannot be observed directly\ndue to their short life time but are rather detected indirectly from the observations of their decays\ndisplaying specific kinematics. The second difficulty, specific to hadronic processes, is that from the\ntheoretical point of view physicists speak in terms of quarks and gluons but from the experimental\npoint of view only hadrons and their respective decays \u2013if any\u2013 can be observed. When colliding\nhadrons this last problem is unavoidable due to the nature of the initial state.\nIn hadronic collisions the extraction of the W and Z bosons properties are made studying their\nleptonic decays which display a distinguishable signal due to the high energy leptons in the final\nstate. This, in particular, allows to get rid of the problems inherent to QCD in the final state. Let\nus remark the decay into the tau channel is not considered as the short life time of the latter makes\nit not \"directly\" observable in a detector.\nIn the case of the Z boson, where Z \u2192 l+ l\u2212 , things are simple as the direct observation of the two\ncharged leptons gives access, via their invariant mass m2l+ l\u2212 , to the invariant mass of the Z. In the case\nof the W the presence of a neutrino in the final state complicates things a lot more. Indeed, because\nthe neutrino does not interact with any part of the detector its kinematics can be only deduced from\nthe overall missing energy for a given event, which will never be as precise as a direct measurement.\nMultipurpose detectors instruments are more precise in the transverse direction of the beam axis,\nsince this is where interesting physics with high pT particles occur. The presence of the beam-pipe\nleaves the very forward region less hermetic in term of calorimetry, forbidding eventually to measure\nthe longitudinal component of the neutrino. This leaves then only the transverse momenta of the\ntwo leptons to extract the W boson mass. As it will be shown in this Chapter, the shapes of these\ntransverse momenta depends on W properties such as its mass MW and its width \u0393W . Nonetheless,\nbecause here we cannot access any Lorentz invariant quantities, the kinematics of the W boson and\nof the leptons in the W rest frame needs to be known with accuracy to model precisely enough the\nobserved kinematics of the leptons in the laboratory frame. Hence the extraction of the W properties\nproves to be a real challenge from both phenomenological and experimental point of views.\n\n\f20\n\nPhenomenological context and motivations\nChannel\n\nMW [GeV]\n\nW \u2192 l \u03bdl\n\n79.910 \u00b1 0.390\n\n\u22120.190 \u00b1 0.580\n\n80.490 \u00b1 0.227\n\n0.700 \u00b1 0.290\n\nW \u2192 \u03bc \u03bd\u03bc\nW \u2192 e \u03bde\nW \u2192 l \u03bdl\nW \u2192 \u03bc \u03bd\u03bc\nW \u2192 e \u03bde\nW \u2192 l \u03bdl\n\n80.310 \u00b1 0.243\n\nMW + \u2212 MW \u2212 [GeV]\n0.549 \u00b1 0.416\n\n80.410 \u00b1 0.180\n\n0.625 \u00b1 0.240\n\n80.477 \u00b1 0.062\n\n0.257 \u00b1 0.117\n\n80.352 \u00b1 0.060\n\n80.413 \u00b1 0.048\n\n0.286 \u00b1 0.152\n\nYear\n1990,1991 [52, 53]\n1995 [54, 55]\n\n2007 [56, 51]\n\n\u00d7\n\nTable 1.2: Sum up of the measured values of MW with the CDF detector for the last decades (1990 \u2192 2007).

The two references next to the year indicate : (1) the results and (2) the detailed W\nmass analysis. The errors are the one obtained when adding up quadratically the statistical and systematic errors.\n\n1.2.2\n\nMotivations for a measurement of the W mass charge asymmetry\n\nAs demonstrated by Gerhard L\u00fcders and Wolfgang Pauli [48], any Lorentz-invariant quantum field\ntheory obeying the principle of locality must be CP T -invariant. For theories with spontaneous\nsymmetry breaking, the requirement of the Lorentz-invariance concerns both the interactions of the\nfields and the vacuum properties. In CP T -invariant quantum field theories, the masses of the particles\nand their antiparticles are equal.\nThe Standard Model is CP T -invariant. In this model, the W + and W \u2212 bosons are constructed\nas each own antiparticle, which couple to leptons with precisely the same SU (2) strength gW . The\nhypothesis of the exact equality of their masses is pivotal for the present understanding of the electroweak sector of the Standard Model. It is rarely put in doubt even by those who consider the\nCP T invariant Standard Model as only a transient model of particle interactions. However, from a\npurely experimental perspective, even such a basic assumption must be checked experimentally to\nthe highest achievable precision.\nThe most precise, indirect experimental constraint on equality of the W + and W \u2212 masses can\nbe derived from the measurements of the life time asymmetries of positively and negatively charged\nmuons [49, 50, 1]. These measurements, if interpreted within the Standard Model framework, verify\nthe equality of the masses of the W + and W \u2212 bosons to the precision of 1.6 MeV. Such a precision\ncannot be reached with direct measurements of their mass difference. The experimental uncertainty\nof the directly measured mass difference from the first CDF run and reported by the Particle Data\nGroup [1] is MW + \u2212 MW \u2212 = \u2212190 \u00b1 580 MeV, i.e. about 400 times higher. More recently the CDF\ncollaboration [51] measured MW + \u2212 MW \u2212 to be 257 \u00b1 117 MeV in the electron decay channel and\n286 \u00b1 136 MeV in the muon decay channel. The Table 1.2 sums up the measured values at CDF\nfor the last decades for both MW and MW + \u2212 MW \u2212 at the time being. Note that in this thesis\nthe experimental measurement will be focused on CDF results since up to this day it is the only\ncollaboration that published experimental values for MW + \u2212 MW \u2212 .\nThese measurements provide to this date the best model independent verification of the equality\nof the masses of the two charge states of the W boson. They are compatible with the charge symmetry\nhypothesis. It is worth stressing, that the present precision of the direct measurement of the charge\naveraged mass of the W boson derived from the combination of LEP and Tevatron results and under\nthe assumption that MW + = MW \u2212 is MW = 80.398 \u00b1 0.025 GeV. It is better by a factor 10 than the\nprecision of the direct individual measurements of the masses of its charged states.\nIn top of the obligatory precision test of the CP T -invariance of the spontaneously broken gauge\n\n\f1.2 The W mass charge asymmetry in the Standard Model\n\n21\n\ntheory with a priori unknown vacuum properties, we are interested to measure MW + \u2212 MW \u2212 at the\nLHC for the following three reasons. Firstly, we wish to constrain the extensions of the Standard\nModel in which the effective coupling of the Higgs particle(s) to the W boson depends upon its\ncharge. Secondly, contrary to the Tevatron case, the measurement of the charge averaged mass at\nthe LHC cannot be dissociated from, and must be preceded by the measurement of the masses of\nthe W boson charge states. Therefore, any effort to improve the precision of the direct measurement\nof the charge averaged mass of the W boson and, as a consequence, the indirect constraint on the\nmass of the Standard Model Higgs boson, must be, in our view, preceded by a precise understanding\nof the W boson charge asymmetries. Thirdly, we would like to measure the W boson polarisation\nasymmetries at the LHC. Within the Standard Model framework the charge asymmetries provide\nan important indirect access to the polarisation asymmetries. This is a direct consequence of both\nthe CP conservation in the gauge boson sector and the purely (V \u2212 A)-type of the conjugation (C)\nand parity (P ) violating coupling of the W bosons to fermions. Any new phenomena contributing\nto the W boson polarisation asymmetries at the LHC must thus be reflected in the observed charge\nasymmetries.\nThe optimal strategies for measuring the charge averaged mass of the W boson and for measuring\ndirectly the masses of its charge eigenstates are bound to be different. Moreover, the optimal strategies\nare bound to be different at the LHC than at the Tevatron.\nAt the Tevatron, the nature of the colliding beam makes it so the production of W + is the same\nthan W \u2212 up to a CP transformation. Then, producing equal numbers of the W + and W \u2212 bosons,\nthe measurement strategy was optimised to achieve the best precision for the charge averaged mass\nof the W boson. For example, the CDF collaboration [51] traded off the requirement of the precise\nrelative control of the detector response to positive and negative particles over the full detector\nfiducial volume, for a weaker requirement of a precise relative control of charge averaged biases of the\ndetector response in the left and right sides of the detector. Such a strategy has provided the best\nup to date measurement of the charge averaged W boson mass, but large measurement errors of the\ncharge dependent W boson masses as seen above in Table 1.2. More detailed explanations on this\nexperimental development are given in Chapter 2 Appendix 2.A.\nIf not constrained by the beam transfer systems, the best dedicated, bias-free strategy of measuring\nof MW + \u2212 MW \u2212 in proton\u2013anti-proton colliders would be rather straightforward. It would boil down\nto collide, for a fraction of time, the direction interchanged beams of protons and anti-protons,\nassociated with a simultaneous change of the sign of the solenoidal B-field in the detector fiducial\nvolume. Such a measurement strategy cannot be realised at the Tevatron leaving to the LHC collider\nthe task of improving the measurement precision.\nThe statistical precision of the future measurements of the W boson properties at the LHC will be\n(stat.)\nlargely superior to the one reached at the Tevatron. Indeed, where this error was of \u03b4MW = 34 MeV\nat the Tevatron for an integrated luminosity L of 200 pb\u22121 [51] at the LHC, for the same measurement,\nin just one year of p p collisions at low luminosity (L = 10 fb\u22121 ) the statistical error should approxi(stat.)\nmately reach \u03b4MW \u2248 5 MeV. On the other hand, it will be difficult to reach comparable or smaller\n(sys.)\n\nsystematic errors. At the Tevatron they equalise to the statistical error, i.e. \u03b4MW = 34 MeV while\n(sys.)\n\nat the LHC the primary goal is, to constrain the hypothesised Higgs mass, to reach \u03b4MW = 15 MeV.\nThe measurements of the W boson mass and its charge asymmetry can no longer be factorised and\noptimised independently. The flavour structure of the LHC beam particles will have to be controlled\nwith a significantly better precision at the LHC than at the Tevatron. While being of limited importance for the MW measurement at the Tevatron, the present knowledge of the momentum distribution\nasymmetries of : (1) the up and down valence quarks and (2) of the strange and charm quarks in the\nproton will limit significantly the measurement precision. The 'standard candles', indispensable for\nprecise experimental control of the reconstructed lepton momentum scale \u2013 the Z bosons and other\n\"onia\" resonances \u2013 will be less powerful for proton\u2013proton collisions than for the net zero charge\nproton\u2013anti-proton collisions. Last but not least, the extrapolation of the strong interaction effects\n\n\f22\n\nPhenomenological context and motivations\n\nmeasured in the Z boson production processes to the processes of W boson production will be more\nambiguous due to an increased contribution of the bottom and charmed quarks.\nEarlier studies of the prospects of the charge averaged W boson mass measurement by the\nCMS [57] and by the ATLAS [58] collaborations ignored the above LHC collider specific effects\nand arrived at rather optimistic estimates of the achievable measurement precision at the LHC. In\nour view, in order to improve the precision of the Tevatron experiments, both for the average and\nfor the charge dependent masses of the W boson, some novel, dedicated strategies, adapted to the\nLHC environment must be developed. Such strategies will have to employ full capacities of the collider and of the detectors in the aim to reduce the impact of the theoretical, phenomenological and\nmeasurement uncertainties on the precision of the W boson mass measurement at the LHC.\n\n1.3\n\nNotations and conventions\n\nIn this section notations and conventions used through out the rest of the document are introduced.\nLet us remind to the reader that to simplify analytic expressions the natural unit convention\nc = 1 and ~ = 1 is adopted. In this notation energies, masses and momenta are all expressed in\nelectron-Volt (eV). Nonetheless, although every MKSA units can be expressed in powers of eV, cross\nsections \u2013noted \u03c3\u2013 are expressed in powers of barns, where 1 barn \u2261 10\u221228 m2 . Especially, unless\nstated otherwise, all differential cross sections d \u03c3/d a for a scalar observable a produced in this work\nare all normalised to nb/[A], A being the dimension of the observable a.\nBoth Cartesian and cylindrical coordinate basis are considered in the inertia laboratory frame.\nThey are defined already with respect to the experimental apparatus. The interaction point, located\nin the center of the ATLAS detector, corresponds to the origin of both coordinate systems. In the\nCartesian basis, colliding hadrons move along the z axis, +y points upward and +x to the center of\nthe LHC accelerating ring. In the cylindrical basis, r is the radius in the x \u2212 y plane, \u03c6 the azimuthal\nangle with respect to the +x direction, and \u03b8 the polar angle with respect to the +z direction. Unit\nvectors along these different directions are noted ~ei where i can stands for x, y, z, r or \u03c6. The\ncomponents of a vector observable ~b along the axis i is noted bi . All angles are expressed in radians\nunless stated otherwise.\nTo define the most relevant kinematics variables to collider physics we consider the example of a\nparticle which four-momentum, energy, momentum and absolute momentum are noted respectively\np, E, p~ and |~\np|. The four-momentum of a particle in its co-variant representation and in the Cartesian\nbasis writes\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nE\n\uf8f7\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6 \uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec px \uf8f7\nE\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7,\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\np=\n=\uf8ec\n(1.1)\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec py \uf8f7\np~\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\npz\n\nwhere the energy E and the momentum p~ of the particle are related to its invariant mass m by the\nrelation E 2 = p~ 2 + m2 . The form of Eq. (1.1) implies the same conventions for the time and space\ncomponents of any other kind of four-vectors. The helicity \u03bb of a particle is defined by the projection\n~ against the axis pointing in the same direction than the momentum of the particle p~,\nof its spin S\nthat is analytically\n~ * p~ .\n\u03bb\u2261S\n(1.2)\n|~\np|\nThe transverse component pT in the r \u2212 \u03c6 plane of the vector p~ is defined by\nq\npT \u2261 p2x + p2y .\n\n(1.3)\n\n\f1.3 Notations and conventions\n\n23\n\nIn that notation transverses energies and missing transverse energies are written ET and E\n/ T . In\nATLAS, and other multipurpose detectors, the central tracking sub-detector bathes in a solenoidal\n~ = |B|\n~ ~ez . In this context, the transverse curvature \u03c1T , defined as the projection of\nmagnetic field B\na particle track on the r \u2212 \u03c6 plane, is related to the particle's transverse momentum via\n\u03c1T \u2261 1/pT .\n\n(1.4)\n\nA particle kinematics can be unequivocally described by its azimuth \u03c6, its transverse momentum pT\nand its rapidity y defined by\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\nE + pz\ny \u2261 ln\n.\n(1.5)\n2\nE \u2212 pz\n\nThe rapidity is additive under Lorentz transformations along the z axis. For massless/ultra-relativistic\nparticles the rapidity equals the pseudo-rapidity \u03b7 which is related to the particle polar coordinate\nby the following relation\n\u03b7 \u2261 \u2212 ln (tan(\u03b8/2)) .\n(1.6)\nFinally to understand more deeply some important physics aspects it is better to consider them in\nthe W Rest Frame (W RF) rather than in the laboratory frame (LAB) where fundamental dynamical\npatterns are blurred by the add-up of the effects of the W boosts. Variables considered in the W RF\nare labeled with a \u2217 superscript while the one with no particular sign are to be considered in the\nlaboratory frame. More details on relativistic kinematics can be found in Ref. [1].\nAnother useful variable that will be extensively used is the charge asymmetry, which, for a scalar\na, is noted Asym(+,\u2212) (a) and defined like\nAsym(+,\u2212) (a) \u2261\n\nd \u03c3 + /d a \u2212 d \u03c3 \u2212 /d a\n,\nd \u03c3 + /d a + d \u03c3 \u2212 /d a\n\n(1.7)\n\nwhere the + and \u2212 refers to the electrical charge of the particle under consideration. Finally when\nthe electrical charge is not made explicit it means we consider indifferently both positive and negative\nparticles, i.e. hereafter W \u2261 W \u00b1 and l \u2261 l\u00b1 .\nDifferent levels of understanding for the observables are considered, respectively the \"true\", the\n\"smeared\" and the \"reconstructed\" levels. The true level, also called particle or generator level, refers\nto the phenomenological prediction of a model or, to be more precise, to the best emulation a given\nMonte Carlo simulation can produce. The smeared level refers to the true level convoluted with\nthe finite resolution of a detector. For an observable a, the link between the smeared distribution\nSmear(a) and the true one True(a) is\nZ\nSmear(a) \u2261 d t True(t \u2212 a) Res(t; a),\n(1.8)\nwhere Res(t; a) is the function governing the response of the detector to an input of value t for the\nobservable a. Here, the general resolution performances of a detector will be usually given using\nrough Gaussian parametrisation\nRes(t; a) = \u221a\n\n1\n2\n2\ne(\u2212t /2 \u03c3a ) ,\n2 \u03c0 \u03c3a\n\n(1.9)\n\nwhere the variance \u03c3a characterises the resolution of the detector for the observable a of the considered\nparticle. Finally the collected data suffer from additional degradations coming from misalignment,\nmiscalibration, limited accuracy of algorithms, etc. All those effects concur to give in the end a\nreconstructed observable deviating from the smeared value a perfect detector would provide. From\nthe purely experimental point of view only the reconstructed level is relevant but the intermediate\nlevels are used for both pedagogical and pragmatic purposes.\n\n\f24\n\n1.4\n\nPhenomenological context and motivations\n\nGeneralities on the production of W boson in Drell\u2013Yan like\nprocesses\n\nThis section starts with a short presentation of the decay of both unpolarised and polarised spins\nstates of a real W boson which leads to the computation of its width \u0393W . These derivations will\nprove to be useful afterward and it allows as well to remind some basics related to the electroweak\ninteraction. After, the whole process hadron \u2212 hadron \u2192 W \u2192 l \u03bdl is presented. The goal is to give\nan intuitive comprehension of the kinematics relevant to the W production. Among these kinematics\nis the charged lepton transverse momentum that is used in the present document for extracting the\nmass of the W .\n\n1.4.1\n(a)\n\nW decay\nUnpolarised W bosons\n\nThe case of the leptonic decay of an unpolarised W boson is considered through the example of\nW \u2212 (P ) \u2192 l\u2212 (p1 ) \u03bd\u0304l (p2 ),\n\n(1.10)\n\nwhere P , p1 and p2 are respectively the four-momenta of the W \u2212 boson, of the charged lepton l\u2212\nand of the anti-neutrino \u03bd\u0304l . This process in the first perturbation order (Born level) is made of one\nFeynman diagram (Fig. 1.1). Here, and in all other Feynman diagrams, the time flow goes from the\nleft to the right.\n\nl\u2212(p1)\nW \u2212(P )\n\nl\u2212(p1)\n\n\u2261\n\nW \u2212 (P )\n\n\u03bd\u0304l (p2)\ntime flow\n\n\u03bdl (\u2212p2)\ntime flow\n\nFigure 1.1: Feynman diagram of the leptonic decay of a W boson at the Born level. The diagram on the right\nrepresents the conventional way to handle anti-particles in perturbative calculation (see text for more details).\n\nThe leptonic decay can be of any type (electronic, muonic or tau) since all leptons can be considered to be massless. Indeed, in the W Rest Frame (W RF) each charged lepton have an energy of the\norder of El \u223c MW /2 \u2248 40 GeV, hence the charged leptons have a Lorentz \u03b2 factor of \u03b2 = 0.999 * * * \u223c 1\nmaking out of them ultra-relativistic particles2 . The amplitude of probability of this process is\nM\u03bb = \u2212i \u221ag2 \u03b5\u03bb\u03bc (P ) \u016b(p1 ) \u03b3 \u03bc 12 (1 \u2212 \u03b3 5 ) v(p2 ).\n(1.11)\n\u221a\nIn this last equation, the weak force is embedded in the strength g/ 2 that couples particles sensible\nto the weak interaction and by the nature of this coupling represented by \u221a\nthe co-variant bi-linear\nterm \u03b3 \u03bc 12 (1 \u2212 \u03b3 5 ) of Vector\u2013Axial (V \u2212 A) form. The coupling constant g/ 2 is usually expressed\nas a function of the Fermi constant GF that was formerly used when modeling weak interactions as\ncontact interactions when occurring at energies scales much lower than MW . For historical reasons\nthey are linked through the relation\ng2\nGF\n\u221a \u2261\n(1.12)\n2 .\n8 MW\n2\n2\n\nIn fact for the case of the \u03c4 , taking into account its mass eventually leads after computation to affect the W width\nat the level of 0.1 %, but we consider this to be negligible in the context of our discussion.\n\n\f1.4 Generalities on the production of W boson in Drell\u2013Yan like processes\n\n25\n\nThe W \u2212 polarisation state of helicity \u03bb is represented by the four-vector \u03b5\u03bb\u03bc (P ), \u016b(p1 ) is the spinor\nof l\u2212 and v(p2 ) that of \u03bdl . We use here the convention which tends to consider that anti-fermions\ngoing forward in time can be treated on the algebraic level as fermions going backward in time. The\nspinors of backward traveling time fermions are noted v(k) \u2261 u(\u2212k) for convenience. Let us note in\nthe V \u2212 A term the operator 21 (1 \u2212 \u03b3 5 ) which, applied to a spinor u, projects only its left-handed\ncomponent uL\n5\n1\n(1.13)\n2 (1 \u2212 \u03b3 ) u = uL ,\nwhile the operator 12 (1 + \u03b3 5 ) projects the right component of the latter\n1\n2 (1\n\n+ \u03b3 5 ) u = uR .\n\n(1.14)\n\nIn other words, the presence of the V \u2212 A term in the current couples only left-handed fermions and\nright-handed anti-fermions in electroweak interactions.\nUsual \"diracologic\" calculus techniques allow to calculate |M\u03bb |2 , which corresponds to the Lorentz\nco-variant expression of the squared amplitude summed and averaged with respect to all possibles\nspins states for the W and leptons. The differential decay rate writes in the W RF\nd\u0393 =\n\n1\n|M\u03bb |2 d Lips,\n2 MW\n\n(1.15)\n\nwhere d Lips, the Lorentz invariant phase space assuring energy-momentum conservation, can be\nreduced here to\n1\n(1.16)\nd Lips =\n\u03b4(El\u2217 \u2212 MW /2) d El\u2217 d \u03a9\u2217l ,\n128 \u03c0 2\nwhere the energy El\u2217 and solid angle \u03a9\u2217l are those of the charged lepton. After the integration over\nthe whole accessible phase space to the particles, the partial width \u0393 (W \u2192 l \u03bdl ) of this process reads\n3\nG F MW\n\u221a\n,\n2 6\u03c0\n\u2261 \u03930W ,\n\n\u0393 (W \u2192 l \u03bdl ) =\n\n(1.17)\n(1.18)\n\nwhich is a Lorentz scalar. The result is the same when considering the case of the W + decay. The\nreader willing to have further details on the previous development or how to undergo such perturbative\ncalculation, can go to classic references in particle physics/quantum field theory such as Refs. [59, 45].\nThis first order expression for the partial width allows to calculate the total width \u0393W of the W +\nor the W \u2212 . The W can decay into leptons or into a pair of quark\u2013anti-quark that in turn decay to\nobservable hadrons with a probability of one\n\u0393W = \u0393(W \u2192 leptons) + \u0393(W \u2192 hadrons).\n\n(1.19)\n\nFor the leptonic decay, in the ultra-relativistic approximation assumed so far, the width is simply\n\u0393(W \u2192 leptons) = \u0393(W \u2192 e \u03bde ) + \u0393(W \u2192 \u03bc \u03bd\u03bc ) + \u0393(W \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd\u03c4 ),\n=\n\n3 \u03930W .\n\n(1.20)\n(1.21)\n\nFor the hadronic decay, the calculus is similar to the one for the leptons except that here : (1) CKM\nmatrix element intervene and mix the quarks flavors and (2) in top of summing/averaging on the\nquarks spin states the sum and average on their color charge states need to be done as well. The\nW can decay into all quarks flavors but the top which is forbidden by energy conservation since\nmt > MW . The quarks possess masses such that they can be treated like the charged leptons as\nultra-relativistic particles. Then studying W \u2192 q q\u0304 0 \u2192 hadrons gives for the partial width\n\u0393W (W \u2192 hadrons) = Nc Vqq0\n\n2\n\n\u03930W ,\n\n(1.22)\n\n\f26\n\nPhenomenological context and motivations\n\nwhere Nc = 3 is the color number, Vqq0 the element of the CKM matrix governing the mixing angle\nbetween flavors q and q\u0304 0 . Summing over all quarks flavors in Eq. (1.22) gives\nXX\nX\n2\n2\nVqq0 ,\nVqq0 =\n(1.23)\nq\n\nq q\u0304 0\n\nq\u0304 0\n\n|\n\n{z\n\n=1\n\n}\n\nwhere P\nthe sum on q 0 of the squared CKM elements translates the unitary of the CKM matrix and\nwhere q is restricted to u and s flavors since the decay to the top is forbidden. Then in this context\n\u0393(W \u2192 hadrons) = 2 Nc \u03930W .\n\n(1.24)\n\nAdding both leptonic and hadronic parts gives eventually in the Born level approximation\n3\nG F MW\n,\n\u0393W = (3 + 2 Nc ) \u221a\n2 6\u03c0\n\n(1.25)\n\nwhere \u03930W has been replaced by its explicit form.

Following those developments it is assumed in the rest of this thesis that \u0393W + = \u0393W \u2212 .\n(b)\n\nPolarised W bosons\n\nConsidering the leptonic decay of a real W boson with a specific polarisation state proves to be very\nhelpful to understand the angular decay behaviour of the quarks or leptons. The polarisation states of\nthe two transverses (\u03bb = \u00b11) and the one longitudinal mode \u03bb = 0 of a W of momentum p~W = pW ~ez\ncan be expressed in the laboratory frame like\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n0\n|~\np |\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec W \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n1 \uf8f7\n0 \uf8f7\n1 \uf8ec\n1 \uf8ec\n(\u03bb=0)\n(\u03bb=\u00b11)\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7.\n,\n\u03b5\n=\n\u03b5\n= \u2213\u221a \uf8ec\n(1.27)\n\uf8f7\nMW \uf8ec\n2 \uf8ec \u00b1i \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n0\nEW\nTransverse polarisation states. The example of the leptonic decay of a W \u2212 is again considered,\nfor a polarisation state of \u03bb = +1. Substituting the expression of \u03b5(\u03bb=+1) in Eq. (1.11) gives the\nprobability amplitude for W \u2212 (\u03bb = +1) \u2192 l\u2212 \u03bd\u0304l . This amplitude squared and averaged on the leptons\nspins, gives the term |MW \u2212 (\u03bb=+1) |2 from which the differential decay width, in the W RF is\nd\u0393\n2\n\u221d MW \u2212 (\u03bb=+1) .\n\u2217\nd cos \u03b8W,l\n\n(1.28)\n\nDeveloping that expression gives, in the end, an angular dependency of\nd\u0393\n\u2217\n\u221d (1 \u2212 cos \u03b8W,l\n)2 ,\n\u2217\nd cos \u03b8W,l\n\u2217\nwhere the angle \u03b8W,l\nis defined like\n\u2217\ncos \u03b8W,l\n\u2261\n\np~W * p~l\u2217\n.\n|~\npW | |~\np\u2217l |\n\n(1.29)\n\n(1.30)\n\n\f1.4 Generalities on the production of W boson in Drell\u2013Yan like processes\n\n27\n\nThe angular dependency in Eq. (1.29) is an important key for understanding the leptons kinematics\nin the W decay. It can actually be understood without going to refined calculations but using only\nthe helicity conservation rules in the high energy limit imposed on the leptons by the mass of the\nW . As it was seen previously the electroweak interactions couples only left-handed fermions and\nright-handed anti-fermions. In the high energy limit chirality and helicity becomes the same, which\nmeans that the helicity is a conserved quantum number and only negative (positive) helicity fermions\n(anti-fermions) are involved. This explain why sometime in the literature, as a shortcut, but only in\nthe high energy limit, negative helicities states are referred to as \"left\" and positive states as \"right\".\n\nInitial state\n\nFinal state\nz\u2032\n\nW\n\nJf,z\u2032 = \u22121\n\nl\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2217\n\u03b8W,l\n\nJi,z = +1\nz\n\n\u03bd\u0304l\n\nz\n\nz\u2032\n\nW\n\nl+\n\n+\n\nJf,z\u2032 = +1\n\u2217\n\u03b8W,l\n\nJi,z = +1\nz\n\nz\n\n\u03bdl\nFigure 1.2: Representation in the W RF of the leptonic decay of a positive helicity W \u2212 boson (up) and W + boson\n(down).\n\nNow the previous example is treated from the helicity conservation point of view. The decay\nW \u2212 \u2192 l \u03bd\u0304l is depicted in the W RF in the upper part of Fig. 1.2. The convention for the axis is the\nfollowing. In the initial state the +z direction is parallel to the direction of the momentum of the W\nin the laboratory frame while the +z 0 direction points to the direction of the decaying charged lepton\nin the final state. In that context, the decay proceeds from an initial W state with Ji,z = +1 to a\nfinal leptonic state with Jf,z 0 = \u22121 and in both cases the system holds a total spin of J = 1, thus the\namplitudes are proportional to the rotation matrices, it reads\nD\nE\n\u2217\n\u2217\ndJJf,z0 ,Ji,z (\u03b8W,l\n) \u2261 J, Jf,z 0 e\u2212i\u03b8W,l Jy J, Ji,z ,\n\n(1.31)\n\nwhich expressions for commonly used spins are tabulated in many places, e.g. Ref.

For the decay of a W possessing a longitudinal polarisation\nstate a detailed calculus can be carried out using the expression of \u03b5(\u03bb=0) with pW = 0 and EW = MW\nin the W RF.

In these processes, a pair of\npartons, the hypothesised building blocks of nucleons, collide and annihilate giving in the final state\na high invariant mass lepton pair l+ l\u2212 . Within QCD, this partonic reaction proved to be achieved at\nfirst order, by the quark\u2013anti-quark annihilation via q q\u0304 0 \u2192 \u03b3 \u2217 /Z \u2192 l+ l\u2212 . The main features of the\nformalism describing Drell\u2013Yan survived to the rise of the QCD up to a few refinements. Still, for\nhistorical reasons even though the whole present discussion takes place within QCD the term parton\nis still used and refers to quarks or gluons.\nBy extension the production of high invariant mass l\u03bdl pair through the production of an intermediate W boson is referred to as \"Drell\u2013Yan like processes\", or \u2013for convenience\u2013 Drell\u2013Yan.\nBelow reminders of the treatment of W boson production in Drell\u2013Yan is given. Let us remark that\nthe formalism described is applicable to the original Drell\u2013Yan and to a wide variety of over hard\nscattering processes including jet and heavy flavour production. Further general details on this topic\ncan be found in Refs. [61, 46, 62].\n(a)\n\nOverview\n\nThe production of a W in Drell\u2013Yan can be written\nHA (PA ) HB (PB ) \u2192 W X \u2192 l(p1 ) \u03bdl (p2 ) X.\n\n(1.40)\n\n\f1.4 Generalities on the production of W boson in Drell\u2013Yan like processes\n\n29\n\nThe associated Feynman like representation of this process is shown in Fig. 1.3, where HA\u221aand HB\nare hadrons of four-momenta PA and PB accelerated by the collider bringing a total energy S in the\ncenter of mass. The collision produces a pair of leptons (l, \u03bdl ) \u2261 {(l\u2212 , \u03bd\u0304l ), (l+ , \u03bdl )} of four-momenta\np1 and p2 .

Purely theoretical derivation of PDFs are not computable as their\ndescription falls in the non perturbative regime of QCD where \u03b1s is too large, therefore they are\nextracted from global fits to data from processes such deep inelastic scattering, Drell\u2013Yan and jet\nproduction at the available energy range fixed by colliders. The implementation of QED and QCD\nradiative corrections from quarks in the initial state are universal, i.e. independent from the process.\nThese corrections contain mass singularities that can be factorised and absorbed in a redefinition\n(renormalisation) of the PDFs. The singularities are removed in the observable cross section while the\nPDFs becomes dependent of a factorisation scale \u03bcf controlled by the DGLAP evolution equations [30,\n31, 32]. This scale is to be identified \u2013for example\u2013 to a typical scale of the process, like the transverse\nmomentum or in the present case by the mass of the resonance \u03bcf = MW .\nThe partonic cross section d2 \u03c3\u0302ij corresponds to the probability that the partons\ni and j, of four\u221a\nmomenta x1 PA and x2 PB , collide and create a W resonance of mass mW = x1 x2 S which in turn\ndecays into leptons l and \u03bdl respectively of four-momenta p1 and p2 . The hard scattering occurs at\nsuch energies that partons can be seen as free, i.e. \u03b1s is small. This allows to calculate the cross\nsection using perturbation theory. Up to a given energy scale higher order Feynman diagrams are\nnot directly computed but accounted by factorising their effect in the value of the constant \u03b1s . This\nrenormalisation scale is the one of the virtual resonance, which means here \u03bcr = MW .

The last term contains all corrections\nabove \u03b1s2 . In practice only the first corrections are brought to a calculus as the number of Feynman\ndiagrams increase rapidly when going to higher order corrections. Let us remark that a correction\n(k)\n(k) (k)\nterm of order (k) is to be implicitly apprehended as \u03c3\u0302ij \u2261 \u03c3\u0302ij \u03b4ij where\n(k)\n\n= 1\n\nif the ij collision contribute to \u03c3\u0302ij ,\n\n(k)\n\n= 0\n\nif the ij collision do not contribute to \u03c3\u0302ij .\n\n\u03b4ij\n\u03b4ij\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\nThe total hadronic cross section is then deduced by embracing all available corrections to the\npartonic cross section and by successively integrating Eq. (1.41) over the accessible phase space to\nthe leptons and partons. This means in the latter case integrating over all possibles x1 and x2 , but\nalso by summing over all possible partonic collisions, which gives eventually\nZ 1\nXZ 1\n\u03c3(S) =\nd x1\nd x2 fiA (x1 , \u03bcf ) fjB (x2 , \u03bcf ) \u03c3\u0302ij (x1 x2 S, \u03bcr ).\n(1.43)\ni,j\n\n0\n\n0\n\nFrom the experimentalist pragmatic point of view the matter of importance is to understand\nthe kinematics of the leptons and how the W properties can be extracted from them. Hence, in\nwhat follows, basics on the partonic cross section and on the PDFs are reminded with emphasis on\nthe kinematics aspects rather than the dynamical issues. After that, an overview of the relevant\nkinematics in W production is given.\n(b)\n\nPartonic level\n\nl\u2212\n\nq\nW\u2212\n\nq\u2032\n\n\u03bdl\n\nFigure 1.4: Feynman diagram for the production of a W in q q\u03040 \u2192 W \u2212 \u2192 l\u2212 \u03bd\u0304l at the Born level.\nThe production of a W at the Born level is made through quark\u2013anti-quark annihilation, which\nis illustrated here for the case of a W \u2212 and noted\nq(k1 ) q\u0304 0 (k2 ) \u2192 W \u2212 \u2192 l\u2212 (p1 ) \u03bd\u0304l (p2 ),\n\n(1.44)\n\nwhere the four-momenta of the particles have been put into brackets.

The\nO(\u03b1) EW radiative corrections to the W in Drell\u2013Yan can be divided in a gauge invariant way into\nthree parts : the initial state radiation (ISR), the initial-final state interferences (non factorisable\ncorrections) and the final state radiation (FSR). The leading ISR (mass singular) QED corrections\ncan be absorbed as stated previously into the PDFs. The non factorisable corrections are negligible\nin resonant W boson production [63]. On the contrary, the FSR corrections affect considerably\nvarious W observables among which is the transverse momentum of the charged lepton whose shape\nis primordial for the extraction of the MW . For example in Ref. [64], the final state photonic correction\nwas approximated and lead to a shift in the value of MW of 50 \u2212 150 MeV for the Tevatron collisions\nat that time. The development of these electroweak NLO corrections is beyond the scope of our\ndiscussion, the reader interested to have more details on this particular topic can look at Refs. [63, 65].\nComing back to the LO, before the phase space integration the differential partonic cross section\n\u2217 ,\ncan be written as a function of \u03b8W,l\n\u00012\nd \u03c3\u0302\n3\n\u2217\n= \u03c3\u0302(\u015d) 1 + \u03bb Q cos \u03b8W,l\n,\n\u2217\nd cos \u03b8W,l\n8\n\n(1.50)\n\nthe angular dependency can be traced back from the derivations made in Eq.

The quantity fap (x) represents the probability\nto have a parton of type a in a proton having a fraction of the four-momentum of the latter comprised\nbetween x and x + d x. Figure 1.11 represents the PDFs extracted from the set CTEQ6.1M [66] used\nin this analysis.\nTwo type of partons can be distinguished in a proton, the valence (v) quarks and the sea (s) quarks.\nThe valence quarks \u2013bound by the strong interaction\u2013 are the elementary particles conferring to the\nproton its properties. The sea quarks arise as a consequence of the short-time fluctuation of the\nwave function of the proton. As described in relativistic quantum physics particles can create and\nannihilate, which translates in the present case that valence quarks/gluons radiate gluons which in\nturn can split again in gluon or pairs of quark\u2013anti-quark. A way to look at those distributions is\nto consider that a probing particle impinging on the proton can resolve in the transverse direction\nits smaller building blocks as better as it possess a high energy. Indeed, using optics vocabulary, to\na probe of momentum p we can associate an intrinsic wave-length \u03bb = 1/p which is most likely to\ndiffract with pattern of the same wave-length. Bearing this fictitious probe in mind the behaviour of\neach flavours are recaptured.\n2\n)\nParton distributions functions inside a proton (\u03bc2f = MW\n\nx u(x) : up\nx u(v)(x) : up of valence\nx d(x) : down\nx s(x) : strange\nx c(x) : charm\nx b(x) : bottom\nx g(x) \u00d7 0.01 : gluon\n\n2.0\n\nx f (x)\n\n1.5\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0.0 \u22124\n10\n\n10\u22123\n\n10\u22122\nx\n\n10\u22121\n\n100\n\nFigure 1.11: CTEQ6.1M parton distributions functions for the quarks and gluons.\nThe up and down quarks are predominant compared to any other flavors which means that as we\nwould expect a probe will most likely hit a u or a d in proton. Near x \u2192 1 the bumps reflect the high\nprobability to hit a valence u or d quarks. In Fig. 1.11 the valence contribution for the case of the\nup quark is shown. Thus, the rise of the probability at low x is due to the sea contributions starting\nfrom 0 at x = 1 and increases as x \u2192 0. The behaviour at small-x is the consequence that probe\n\n\f36\n\nPhenomenological context and motivations\n\nstarts to resolve more and more of de-localised sea quarks. The \u016b and d \u0304 behaviour can be directly\ndeduced from the removal of the valence bump present for the u and d flavors. Let us stress than\n \u0304\neven though the masses of the u and d quarks are very close for x < 10\u22124 we observe that \u016b < d.\nThe patterns in the strange, charm and bottom quarks can be understood from the previous\nexplanations for the up and down quarks of the sea. For a given x the probability to observe a given\nflavour decreases as the quark mass increase. Indeed, it is harder to create virtual pairs of heavy quarks\ncompared to lighter quarks given the same amount of energy explaining why s(x) > c(x) > b(x).\nConcerning the top flavour the energies scales we are working with are far too small to resolve any\ntop quarks hence, t(x) = 0. The distributions of the s\u0304, c\u0304 and b\u0304 are exactly the same in a first\napproximation. For example, only very recently the strange quark asymmetry has been implemented\nin some PDF set. Such corrections are not present in the CTEQ6.1M set that was used in this work,\nthen later on q (s) (x) = q\u0304 (s) (x).\nFinally there is the gluon contribution that needed to be divided to a factor of 100 to be scaled\nto the frame.\n(d)\n\nHadronic level at the improved leading order\n\nHigher order corrections are necessary to get rid in the cross section as much as possible of the\ndependency from the unphysical renormalisation and factorisation scales due to the perturbation\nexpansion truncation. Nonetheless, the comprehension of the main features of the W and leptons\nkinematics can be done studying just an improved leading-order description of the phenomenon, and\nwhen necessary, use higher order corrections to pin-point a particular effect in a given phase-space\ndomain.\nThis improved LO, considered in the rest of this Chapter, is defined by taking the LO expressions\nof the partonic cross section convoluted with the remormalised PDFs and by taking part of the\nradiation of the partons in the initial state. Due to momentum conservation, the radiation of gluons\nand photons off partons provide a realistic picture in which quarks produce a W with a non zero\ntransverse motion. Note that by \"part of the radiation\" we mean that emission of real gluons and\nphotons are taken into account but without embracing all other virtual loop corrections belonging\nto the same order in \u03b1s or \u03b1. In this scheme, Fig. 1.12 represents an example of such initial state\nradiation for a particular event.\n\nq\nW\nW\nq\n\ng\n\nq\n\nq\u0304 \u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nq\u2032\n\nq\u2032\n\n(a)\n\ng\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 1.12: Example of the emission of real gluons and photons from the initial state partons in a Feynman-like\nrepresentation (a) and in the associated ~\nx-space representation (b).\n\nBefore going any further common variables and conventions are reminded.

The\nMonte Carlo used to produce these preliminaries pedagogical histograms is WINHAC which will be\ndescribed with more details in Chapter 3. All Monte Carlo predictions in this document are, unless\nstated otherwise, produced using WINHAC. The derivations presented below will serves as a base to\nunderstand later on with more refinement the production of W for each electrical charge channel\nseparately.\nRapidity of the W boson. In the improved LO picture the rapidity approximately equals the\nLO expression Eq. (1.60), that is yW \u2248 ln(x1 /x2 ). This form translates an unbalance between the\nfractions x1 and x2 , and explains why the rapidity is strongly correlated to the PDFs. To the leading\norder approximation we add the one of the narrow width, in that context the x1 and x2 fractions\nentering the PDFs now reads\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\nX\nX\nB M\n\u221aW eyW\n\u221aW e\u2212yW .\nfiA (x1 ) fjB (x2 ) \u2248\nfiA M\nf\n(1.66)\nj\nS\nS\ni,j\n\ni,j\n\nThe pattern of the rapidity distribution can be devised only from the previous expression, the weight\nfrom the partonic cross section being just a multiplicative factor.\n3\n\nFor reminder the Cauchy-Lorentz function L(x; x0 , \u03b5) =\nreaches zero with positive values.\n\n1\n\u03b5\n\u03c0 (x\u2212x0 )2 +\u03b52\n\ntends to a Dirac distribution \u03b4(x \u2212 x0 ) as \u03b5\n\n\f38\n\nPhenomenological context and motivations\n(a) \u2212 W boson rapidity\n5.0\n\nx1 \u2192\u2190\u2212 x2\n\nx1 \u2192\u2190 x2\n\n2.4\n\nx1 \u2212\u2192\u2190 x2\n\n(b) \u2212 W boson transverse momentum\nIntrinsic kT\n\n2.0\nd \u03c3/d pT,W [nb/GeV]\n\nd \u03c3/d yW [nb]\n\n4.0\n3.0\n2.0\n1.0\n0.0\n\n1.6\nIntermediate domain\n(npQCD & pQCD)\n\n1.2\n0.8\n0.4\n\n\u22126\n\n\u22124\n\n\u22122\n\n0\nyW\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n0.0\n0\n\nPerturbative physics dominates\n5\n\n10\n\n15\npT,W [GeV]\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nFigure 1.13: General features of a the W rapidity (a) and transverse momentum (b) in Drell\u2013Yan at the improved\nLO order. The \"intermediate\" domain in pT,W is ruled by both non-perturbative and perturbative QCD (npQCD &\npQCD).\n\nThe range for the rapidity can be deduced using the constraints on x1 and x2\n0 < x1,2 < 1\n\n\u21d2\n\n|yW,max | \u2248 ln\n\n\u0010\u221a \u0011\nS\nMW\n\n,\n\n(1.67)\n\nwhich means a higher energy in the collision provides more kinematic energy\n\u221a to the W while its mass\nMW reduces this kinematic energy. Replacing in Eq. (1.67) MW and S by their values one find\nthat at the LHC the rapidity range is approximately |yW,max | \u2248 5 as displayed in Fig. 1.13.\nThe W rapidity distribution tends to zero when |yW | \u2192 5 because one of the fraction x is\nnecessarily tending to 1 and as seen previously\n\u221a f (x \u2192 1) \u2192 0. Considering, in a first approximation,\nthat x fractions are of the order of x \u223c MW / S one find that in average xLHC \u223c 6 \u00d7 10\u22123 while for\nthe Tevatron energies xTeva. \u223c 4 \u00d7 10\u22122 . This shows how the energy in the LHC collisions will make\nsmall-x contributions predominant with respect to the one of the Tevatron.\nIn the region yW \u2248 0, the form of the rapidity seen in Eq. (1.60) indicates that x\u221a\n1 \u2248 x2 , which\nhappens for sea quarks most of the time. Indeed, substituting in Eqs. (1.61\u20131.62) MW / S \u223c 6\u00d710\u22123\nand yW = 0 gives x1,2 \u2248 6 \u00d7 10\u22123 . For these values of x the probability of having a valence quark is\nsmall, most contributions comes from sea quarks.\nOn the other hand, in the forward rapidity region, there must be an important unbalance between\nx1 and x2 . In an extreme case scenario, this condition is fulfilled when a quark bears an important\nfraction xhigh while the other one possesses a very small fraction xlow , which is most probably occurring\nwhen a valence quark and a low energy sea \u221a\nquark collide. This can be shown using rough values,\nsubstituting again in Eqs. (1.61\u20131.62) MW / S \u2248 6 \u00d7 10\u22123 and |yW | \u2248 4 gives, xhigh \u2248 0.3 and\nxlow \u2248 10\u22124 . The fall of the rapidity, occurring at yW \u2248 3, is then a consequence of the fall of the\nvalence quarks PDFs densities as x \u2192 1.\nLet us remark that the impossibility to measure the neutrino longitudinal component pz,\u03bd implies\nthat while trying to resolve it using the other measurable kinematics one ends up with an equation\nof second degree in pz,\u03bd with two solutions leading in turn to two ambiguous solutions for yW .\nNonetheless, even if the problem is not solvable on an event-per-event basis, some solution based on\nthe whole data event allows to partly overpass the problem in the narrow-width approximation [67].\nTransverse momentum of W boson. The distribution of pT,W (Fig. 1.13.(b)) in this improved\nLO picture is the consequence of three main effects. First is the perturbative emission of real gluons\nand quark/anti-quark gluon scattering (Fig. 1.6.(b,c)) which dominates at high pT . As pT decreases\n\n\f1.4 Generalities on the production of W boson in Drell\u2013Yan like processes\n\n39\n\nthe spectrum is governed by the re-summation of leading-logs, then finally below pT,W \u2248 2 GeV the\nintrinsic transverse momentum of partons inside the proton dominates.\nSince the intrinsic kT of partons modeling enters our analysis more details are given below. This\nintrinsic kT can be initially apprehended as the consequence of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle\napplied to the confinement of the partons in a finite volume of the order of a Fermi. Still, a quick\ncalculus shows this effect cannot totally account for the observed data and this initial kT is nowadays\ndepending on the energy involved in the collider. Assuming a simple factorisation of this effect from\nthe longitudinal motion ruled by the PDFs the expression of the latter necessary to the cross section\ncalculus can be accounted doing the following substitution\nf (x) \u2192 h(~kT ) f (x),\n\n(1.68)\n\nwhere h(~kT ) is the density of probability for a parton to have a transverse momentum of ~kT . Modeled\nwith a Gaussian distribution it can reads :\nb\nh(~kT ) = exp(\u2212b kT2 ),\n(1.69)\n\u03c0\np\nwhere the average value of kT noted hkT i is hkT i = \u03c0/(4 b). This values needs to be estimated for\na particular collider to match to the data. In the case of the Tevatron energies it is estimated to be\nof hkT i \u223c 2.2 GeV and should be higher at the LHC.\n(a) \u2212 Charged lepton pseudorapidity\n5.0\n\n(b) \u2212 Charged lepton transverse momentum\n\n\u03b7l\nyW\n3.0\nd \u03c3/d pT,l [nb/GeV]\n\nd \u03c3/d \u03b7l [nb]\n\n4.0\n3.0\n2.0\n\npT,W = 0\npT,W 6= 0\n\n2.0\n\n1.0\n\n1.0\n0.0\n\n\u22126\n\n\u22124\n\n\u22122\n\n0\n\u03b7l\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n0.0\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n40\npT,l [GeV] MW /2\n\n50\n\n60\n\nFigure 1.14: General features of the charged lepton pseudo-rapidity (c) and transverse momentum (b) in Drell\u2013Yan\nat the improved LO order. In the case of pT,l both LO and improved LO are shown.\n\nPseudo-rapidity of the charged lepton. The pseudo-rapidity of the charged lepton is obtained\nby adding to its intrinsic rapidity yl\u2217 in the W RF the rapidity of the W , it reads at LO\n\u03b7l = yW + yl\u2217 .\n\n(1.70)\n\nThe rapidity of the W , as shown previously, is related to the energy in the collision and the mass of\nthe W while the intrinsic rapidity yl\u2217 is a consequence of the angular decay governed by the V \u2212 A\ncoupling. Indeed, still at LO, yl\u2217 takes the form\n!\n\u2217\n1 + cos \u03b8W,l\n1\n\u2217\n.\n(1.71)\nyl = ln\n\u2217\n2\n1 \u2212 cos \u03b8W,l\nThe estimation of the contribution of the intrinsic rapidity of the lepton to the total pseudo-rapidity\ncan be evaluated roughly. We make the assumption that in average there is as much charged leptons\n\n\f40\n\nPhenomenological context and motivations\n\nspreading the fundamental yW distribution that narrowing it, which can be formalised stating there\n\u2217 >\u2248 1/2 than < cos \u03b8 \u2217 >\u2248 \u22121/2. Substituting these averaged values of cos \u03b8 \u2217\nis as much < cos \u03b8W,l\nW,l\nW,l\nin Eq. (1.71) gives hyl\u2217 i = \u00b10.6, i.e. | hyl\u2217 i | < | hyW i |. Then, the main pattern of the \u03b7l distribution is\nmostly inherited from the one present in the yW distribution. This explains why \u03b7l distribution covers\nsensibly the same range than yW as can be seen in Fig. 1.14.(c). Because the W rapidity cannot be\nmeasured the \u03b7l distribution is used as a substitute and proves particularly useful in the PDFs study.\nMore details on that topic in the context of the ATLAS experiment can be found in Ref. [68].\nTo be completely honest here, and tease the reader's curiosity, the assumption that spreading and\nnarrowing behaviour of the \u03b7l distribution occurs in the same proportions is more or less verified at\nthe Tevatron but it will not be the case at the LHC. In the latter case the yl\u2217+ tends to narrow the\ninner yW spectrum while the yl\u2217\u2212 spreads the latter. Then, the previous calculus is justified since\nboth charge being merged the narrowing and spreading compensate each other and also because\nhyl\u2217 i < hyW i.\nTransverse momentum of the charged lepton. The distribution for the transverse momentum\nof the charged lepton at the hadronic level is directly linked to the one at the partonic level. At\nleading order, pT,W = 0 which implies pT,l = p\u2217T,l . Then a jacobian peak around \u2248 MW /2 is visible,\nits smearing coming from contributions in which mW \u2248 MW . Contributions displaying a value mW\ntoo far from the central value MW are, as it was shown in Eq.(1.57) highly improbable. Then, the\npT,l distribution which is observable in a detector presents a jacobian peak which position allows to\ndeduce the value of MW .\nThings gets more complicated when going to a more realistic scenario where the W possesses a\ntransverse motion. To understand that the relative angle between pT,W and p\u2217T,l in the r \u2212 \u03c6 plane\nnoted cos \u03c6\u2217W,l is considered. The sign of cos \u03c6\u2217W,l give rise to ambivalent behaviour for pT,l . In the\nfirst case, where cos \u03c6\u2217W,l > 0, pT,W is such that the total Lorentz boost based from p~W increase the\nvalue of pT,l . In such events then pT,l are shifted to higher values, to the right of the Jacobian peak.\nOn the contrary, in (cos \u03c6\u2217W,l < 0)-cases pT,l are decreased, that is shifted to the left of the Jacobian\npeak.\nFigure 1.14.(b) shows how much the transverse momentum of the W smears the sharpness of the\nJacobian peak. That means that the extraction, from the bare pT,l distribution, of MW with a Monte\nCarlo imply a refined implementation of the pT,W .\nLet us note also that the smearing of the jacobian peak being partially due to the W width the tail\nof the distribution beyond \u2248 MW /2 can be used to measure \u0393W . This is however beyond the scope\nof the present document. The reader interested in this topic can consult Refs. [61, 46] for example.\n\nTransverse momentum of the neutrino. The transverse momentum distribution of the neutrino\ndisplays the very same features than the one of the charged lepton. Still from the experimental point\nof view, it is very different as pT,\u03bdl can be deduced only from the missing transverse energy given by\nthe entire response of the calorimetry of a detector. For that reason pT,\u03bdl is preferentially noted p/T,\u03bd\nor E\n/ T . The calibration of the missing transverse energy needs at least a few years, and even after\nthat it cannot compete with the study of the charged lepton, indeed as can be seen in Table 1.3 the\nCDF II results [51] shows large systematic errors on MW when using the p/T,\u03bd distribution.\n\nTransverse mass of the lepton pair. The transverse mass was suggested in Refs. [69, 70] to\nprovide an alternative to measure the mass and width of the W boson. It consists of calculating the\ninvariant mass mT, l \u03bdl the lepton pair would have if pz,l and pz,\u03bd would be null. For that reason it is\n\n\f1.5 An invitation to the rest of the document\n\n41\n\ncalled the transverse mass4 is defined like\nq\nmT, l \u03bdl \u2261\npT,l + p~T,\u03bdl )2 ,\n(pT,l + pT,\u03bdl )2 \u2212 (~\nq\n=\n2 pl p\u03bdl (1 \u2212 cos \u03c6l\u03bdl ).\n\n(1.72)\n(1.73)\n\nNow since the transverse momenta of both leptons enter as a product the influence of pT,W upon pT,l\nis counterbalanced by the opposite effect upon pT,\u03bdl . At LO in the W RF both leptons transverse\nmomenta are equal, a purely longitudinal boost does not affect these values, hence pT,l = pT,\u03bdl and\ncos \u03c6l\u03bdl = 0 which gives for the transverse mass the mT, l \u03bdl = 2 pT,l , explaining why in this case the\njacobian peak is located at MW .\nFigure 1.15 represents the pT,l and mT, l \u03bdl distributions for three different steps in the simulation\nof W in Drell\u2013Yan inside ATLAS [71]. Note that in each step trigger and acceptance cuts were made\naccording to the ATLAS requirements, in particular pT,l and E\n/ T cuts can be clearly distinguished\nlooking at the low pT region of the histograms, for further details see Ref. [71]. The first case\nconsidered is the true level, that is the prediction from the Monte Carlo at pure leading order where\npT,W = 0. Both pT,l and mT, l \u03bdl jacobian peaks are sharp. When adding up QCD corrections in\nthe initial state the jacobian peak of pT,l is very smeared by pT,W 6= 0, while mT, l \u03bdl still displays a\nsharp jacobian peak. The last step consists to pass the latter event generations to a simulation of the\nATLAS detector. The good resolution for the charged lepton does not change a lot, while the bad\nresolution for E\n/ T smears a lot the jacobian peak of mT, l \u03bdl .\n(a) - Charged lepton transverse momentum\n\n(b) - Leptons transverse mass\n7000\n\nATLAS\n\n6000\n\nTrue level, pT ,W = 0\nTrue level, pT ,W 6= 0\n\n5000\n\nSmeared level, pT ,W 6= 0\n\n4000\n3000\n2000\n1000\n0\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\nNumber of events / (1 GeV)\n\nNumber of events / (0.5 GeV)\n\n7000\n\n6000\n\nATLAS\n\nTrue level, pT ,W = 0\nTrue level, pT ,W 6= 0\n\n5000\n\nSmeared level, pT ,W 6= 0\n\n4000\n3000\n2000\n1000\n0\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\npT,l [GeV]\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\n110\n\n120\n\nmT, l \u03bdl [GeV]\n\nFigure 1.15: Transverse momentum of the lepton (a) and of the transverse mass (b) at the true level for pT,W = 0,\npT,W 6= 0 and at the smeared level with pT,W 6= 0 based on the ATLAS detector resolution [Data extracted from [71]].\n\n1.5\n\nAn invitation to the rest of the document\n\nUp to now, the motivation and the general context for a measurement of the W charge asymmetry\nMW + \u2212 MW \u2212 within the Standard Model paradigm have been described.

Especially, the emphasis is made\non the ATLAS tracker since the analysis was restricted using this sub-detector capabilities.

It almost exclusively treats about the Monte Carlo\nevent generator WINHAC. The physics inside it is described along with the tools implemented downstream for the stand-alone analysis that was made. The Chapter describes as well the work done to\ninclude this Monte Carlo event generator inside the ATLAS software environment.\nChapter 4 presents the detailed work that was done to understand the kinematics of the W + and\n\u2212\nW at the LHC made necessary for the prospect of the measurement of MW + \u2212 MW \u2212 but as well\nas for our other ongoing effort made on W properties extraction such as MW [72, 73] or \u0393W [74].\nActually we consider this Chapter to be of interest for every physicist working on the W production\nin Drell\u2013Yan at the LHC, for ATLAS, CMS and even LHCb detectors.\nChapter 5 presents dedicated strategies to measure MW + \u2212 MW \u2212 and their qualitative evaluation.\nAfter a short introduction of the general experimental context (trigger, acceptance, background, etc.)\nthe analysis strategies devised to measure the W boson mass charge asymmetry. The strategies\nwere specifically designed for this measurement to get rid as much as possible of the dependency\nfrom both Monte Carlo and apparatus imperfections to decrease the impact of systematic errors on\nMW + \u2212 MW \u2212 .\nA Conclusion closes the document by summing up the results obtained with the proposed methods\nand, by taking a step backward, localise the importance of the present work amid the ongoing effort\non precision measurements of the W boson properties at the LHC.\n\n\fChapter 2\n\nThe ATLAS experiment\nAtlas : \"Where is he ? Where is your titan ?! I will show him sorrow! I will\nshow him pain ! I will show him Atlas ! I am the champion this city, this\nland, this orb needs.\"\nSuperman #677 - In The SHADOW Of ATLAS (August 2008)\n\nThe Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [75, 76, 77, 78, 79] will be the largest circular accelerator\nof hadrons ever build providing unprecedented energy and luminosity. It is buried \u2248 100 \u2212 150 m\nunderground within the CERN [80] facility near Geneva. This accelerator was designed to fulfill\nthe increasing needs to probe ever smaller lengths scales to unravel the nature of the interactions of\nelementary particles. For that purpose the LHC accelerates in its ring counter rotating bunches of\nhadrons at ultra relativistic speed and collide them in four distinct points. The particles produced\nduring these collisions are studied using one or several detectors built in the vicinity of each of the\nfour interaction points. Among them is ATLAS [81, 82] a general purpose detector.\nIn this chapter, two of the most fundamentals collider parameters from the physicist point of view,\ni.e. the energy in the center of mass and the luminosity, are reminded in the LHC context. Then, the\nATLAS detector is presented by reviewing the geometry and technology implemented within each of\nits sub-detectors : the tracker, the calorimeters and the muon spectrometer. Especially the tracker,\nwhich performances are used in this work, is described with more details. Some emphasis are made\non the aspects relevant to the measurement of MW + \u2212 MW \u2212 through the observation of the process\nhadron \u2212 hadron \u2192 W \u2192 l \u03bdl where l for reminder stands for l \u2261 {e, \u03bc}.\n\n2.1\n2.1.1\n\nThe Large Hadron Collider\nThe collider\n\nThe need to produce physics\nresonances of ever higher masses at noticeable rates within colliders\n\u221a\nrequires higher energy S in the center of mass of the collision as well as higher luminosity L. The\nimportance of synchrotron radiation in e+ /e\u2212 collisions is such that it proved to be prohibitive above\nLEP [83] energies to use circular collider. Then, the idea of studying non e+ e\u2212 collisions using the\nLEP tunnel began to be studied in 1984 [84] and at the time the LEP collider shutdown in 2000, the\nproject of colliding hadrons was decided [75]. So far hadron\u2013hadron colliders were designed for p p\u0304\ncollisions like at the SPS or the Tevatron colliders. Above 3 TeV the cross sections for p p and p p\u0304\ncollisions are comparable but for the latter case the luminosity would have been inferior to a factor\n100 at the LHC due to the difficulty to produce anti-protons. On the other hand collisions of particles\nholding the same charge impose a priori to have two independent rings having magnets of opposite\npolarity with separate cryostat which would have turned out to be more expensive. For the LHC a\nspecial two-in-one dipole magnet was conceived in the aim to be more economic and compact. Thus,\n\n\f44\n\nThe ATLAS experiment\n\np p collisions being more easily achievable and less costly it was the chosen option. The LHC will as\nwell make collisions of heavy positively charged ions.\nFrom the physics point of view the most striking difference between hadron\u2013hadron and e+ e\u2212\ncollisions is that in the primer case the colliding particles are composite and gives for each inelastic\nprocess of interest to the physicists an important number of other particles. Hence, the LHC is\nprimarily designed for discoveries rather than for precision measurements, still, its high center of mass\nenergy and luminosity combined to the detectors performances should allow precision measurements.\nAnother consequence of the hadrons composition is\u221athat partons participating in an inelastic scattering\nborrow only part of the whole disposable energy \u221a\nS. For the case of W production in Drell\u2013Yan we\nhave seen in Eq. (1.64) that in average \u2248 0.6 % of S is used.\nFig. 2.1 shows the different parts entering each superconducting magnet dipole that were assembled along the 27 km circumference of the LHC ring. Each proton beams are moving in opposite\ndirections inside each of the two main dipole aperture beam-pipe. The dipole generates a magnetic\nfield of 8.33 T to maintain the protons beams along the ring circumference, other magnets are present\nto focus and correct any deviations of the beams.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 2.1: The LHC superconducting magnet cross section (a) and in a 3D rendition (b) [ c CERN Geneva].\n\nThe different steps of the protons acceleration and injection inside the LHC ring are shown in\nFig. 2.2. The proton beams, split in bunches of oblate volume, are successively accelerated by the\nLINAC2, the BOOSTER, the PS and the SPS accelerators. The SPS injects proton bunches of\n450 GeV in the LHC superconducting magnet, half moving in one direction and the over half in the\nopposite direction. Each\nenergy in\n\u221a proton in a bunch has an energy of Ep = 7 TeV providing a total tot.\nand\nits\ninelastic\npart\n\u03c3\nthe center of mass of S = 14 TeV. The total p p cross section \u03c3ptot.\np\np p,inel. are\napproximately equals to\n\u03c3ptot.\n\u2248 100 mb,\np\n\n\u03c3ptot.\np,inel.\n\n\u2248\n\n80 mb.\n\n(2.1)\n(2.2)\n\nThe volume of a proton bunch can be defined using Gaussian functions which full widths at half\nmaximum are, with respect to the z-axis along which protons move, of \u03c3T = 15 \u03bcm in the transverse\ndirection and \u03c3z = 5.6 cm in the longitudinal direction. Each bunch, composed of an order of \u223c 1011\nprotons, are separated by a time lapse of 25 ns (7.5 m).\n\n\f2.1 The Large Hadron Collider\n\n45\n\nFigure 2.2: Representation of the different steps, within the CERN accelerator complex, necessary to inject protons\nin the LHC ring [Figure adapted from CERN-DI-0606052 c CERN Geneva].\n\nThe luminosity L is defined at the LHC like\nL=\n\nNp2 kb f \u03b3\nF,\n4\u03c0 \u03b5n \u03b2 \u2217\n\n(2.3)\n\nwhere Np is the number of protons per bunch, kb the number of bunches, f the revolution frequency\naround the ring, \u03b3 the relativistic Lorentz factor related to the proton velocity (\u03b3 \u2248 7500), \u03b5n the\nnormalised emittance and \u03b2 \u2217 the beta function at the interaction point. The factor F \u2248 0.9 accounts\nfor the reduction of interaction numbers due to the full crossing angle \u03b8c and other characteristics of\nthe beam configuration, it reads :\ns\n\u0012\n\u00132\n.\n\u03b8 \u03c3\n\u221ac z \u2217 .\nF =1\n1+\n(2.4)\n2 \u03b5n \u03b2\n(incl.)\n\nThe number of produced inclusive events Nevents for a process with an inclusive cross section\n\u03c3process over a time lapse \u2206t = t2 \u2212 t1 is related to the integrated luminosity L over \u2206t via\nZ t2\n(incl.)\nNevents = \u03c3process L\nwith\nL\u2261\nL dt,\n(2.5)\nt1\n\nThe nominal luminosity of the LHC, expressed in several convenient unit should reach :\nLhigh = 1034 cm\u22122 s\u22121 = 107 mb\u22121 s\u22121 = 10\u22125 fb\u22121 s\u22121 = 10 nb\u22121 s\u22121 .\n\n(2.6)\n\nBased on Eqs (2.1,2.2), this gives a frequency of \u223c 1 GHz of produced events among which inelastic\nevents occur at the rate of 0.8 GHz. This will eventually lead each event of interest to be accompanied\n\n\f46\n\nThe ATLAS experiment\n\nby an average of 20 inelastic events also referred to as the \"pile-up\". For this reason the LHC will\nuse during the first three years a lower luminosity Llow = Lhigh /10 for which the smaller pile-up (\u2248 2\nevents) will allow physicists to understand first the detectors before exploiting them at the design\nluminosity.\nMost of the analysis in this work are considered for one year of LHC data taking at low luminosity,\nwhich, due to technical reasons, was assumed to be of the order of 107 s. Thus, one year of data taking\nin ATLAS at low luminosity implies an integrated low luminosity of\nyear\nL1low\n= 10 fb\u22121 = 107 nb\u22121 .\n\n(2.7)\n\nthe choice for unit being cast on nb as the W inclusive/cut cross sections are of this order.\nThe LHC ring is planed to accelerate and collide heavy ions as well. For the purpose of our\nmeasurement strategy the possibility of having run programs with light ions have been considered.\nIn such a context the total energy of 7 TeV for the accelerated hadron is shared between the different\nnucleons building it. The energy Enucleon of a nucleon belonging to an hadron of mass A and charge\nZ is\nZ\nEnucleon = \u00d7 7 [TeV].\n(2.8)\nA\nConsidering the collision of two hadrons\np 1 and 2 respectively of masses A1 and A2 the nucleon\u2013\nnucleon (n1 n2 ) center of mass energy is Sn1 n2 = En1 + En2 where the energies En1 and En2 of each\nnucleon are computed using Eq. (2.8). Concerning the luminosity, it should be possible in the most\noptimistic case scenario to reach LA1 A2 = Lpp /A1 A2 , Lpp corresponding to the standard integrated\nluminosity for p p collisions. In the present study, using these rules for the case of d d collisions that\nwere occasionally considered, gives\nEnucleon = 3.5 TeV,\n\n(2.9)\n\nLdd = Lpp /4.\n\n(2.10)\n\nTo sum up for p p and d d collisions, the nucleons energies and the integrated luminosity for one year\nat low luminosity are\np p : Lpp = 10.0 fb\u22121 ,\n\u22121\n\nd d : Ldd = 2.50 fb\n\n,\n\nEnucleon = 7.0 TeV\n\n(\u21d2 Ep = 7 TeV),\n\n(2.11)\n\nEnucleon = 3.5 TeV\n\n(\u21d2 Ed = 7 TeV).\n\n(2.12)\n\nA number of produced events related to a process is computed using Eq. (2.5).\n\n2.1.2\n\nThe LHC experiments\n\nThe detectors layout around the LHC ring is shown in Fig. 2.2. The actual approved experiments\nare : Alice, ATLAS, CMS, LHCb, LHCf and TOTEM.\nATLAS (A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS) and CMS [85] (Compact Muon Solenoid) are two detectors\nmade for general studies of the physics at the LHC, i.e. refine the Standard Model parameters,\nconfirm/infirm the existence of the Higgs boson and study new physics signatures (hypothesised\nBSM models, new signatures). Both can measure the signatures of high pT objects such as e, \u03b3, \u03bc,\n\u03c4 , jets, b-jets, missing transverse energy E\n/ T , etc.\nAlice [86] (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) has been created to study lead ions collisions to\npossibly materialise a state of matter known as quark\u2013gluon plasma, which may have existed soon\nafter the Big Bang.\nLHCb [87] (Large Hadron Collider beauty) is dedicated to the study of b quarks decays in hadrons\nto understand the mechanism of CP violation that could explain the matter/anti-matter asymmetry\nin the Universe.\nThe LHCf [88] (Large Hadron Collider forward) experiment uses forward particles created in\ncollisions as a source to simulate cosmic rays in laboratory conditions.\nTOTEM [89] (TOTal Elastic and diffractive cross section Measurement) will measure the general\nproperties of p p collisions such as the total cross section and the luminosity.\n\n\f2.2 The ATLAS detector\n\n2.2\n2.2.1\n\n47\n\nThe ATLAS detector\nDetector requirements\n\nThe ATLAS detector was designed in function of the expected physics signatures, the high energies\ninvolved in the hadrons collisions and the high luminosity context present at the LHC. This imposed\nhigh constraints over the detector performances, size and trigger system. Assuming an operation life\nof ten years or so the detecting devices and their associated electronics must stand high radiation\ndue to the important particles fluxes. The other problem is that in average each inelastic scattering\nof interest that triggers the apparatus is accompanied by usually \u2248 20 other non-interesting inelastic\nevents. To decrease as much as possible this pile-up impact the detector needs, using a highly efficient\ntrigger, to provide a precise and fast detector response. Also the detector needs a high granularity to\nlift as much as possible overlapping ambiguities between the processes of interest and the pile-up.\nThe size of the ATLAS detector is directly related to the \u223c TeV energy scale of the produced\nparticles which needs to be contained. For example, electrons of 1 TeV are absorbed by 30 radiation\nlength (X0 ), pions of 1 TeV by 11 absorption length (\u03bb) and measuring momenta of muons of 1 TeV\nneeds bending power of several T m. Another reason for the size of the ATLAS detector is the\nchoice made for the magnetic field which, contrary to CMS, is separated in two pieces. The first one\n(solenoid) used by the inner tracking detector allows a good charged particle momentum resolution\nand reconstruction efficiency while the muons \u2013not stopped by the calorimetry\u2013 have their momenta\nresolved by large magnets generating a toroidal over a large range of momenta.\nTurning now to the events signatures, ATLAS needs to identify extremely rare events, some as\nlow as representing 10\u221214 of the total p p cross section. In the LHC context, lepton identification\nis challenging due to the high QCD background (e.g. the electrons jet ratio is e\u00b1 /jet \u223c 10\u22125 ) and\nHiggs/BSM hypothesised signatures constrained strongly each sub-detectors performances.\nThese general requirements reminded, we give an overview of the ATLAS detector.\n\n2.2.2\n\nOverview of the ATLAS detector\n\nFigure 2.3: Overview of the ATLAS detector [CERN-GE-0803012 c CERN Geneva].\n\n\f48\n\nThe ATLAS experiment\n\nDetector. The ATLAS detector is nominally forward-backward symmetric with respect to the\ninteraction point. The sub-detectors layout follows basics rules common to all hadronic colliders.\nStarting from the beam-pipe one can find a tracking device, then electromagnetic and hadronic\ncalorimeters and finally a detector for muons. The inner tracker and the muon spectrometer are\nimmersed in magnetic fields generated respectively by a thin superconducting solenoid and three\nlarge superconducting toroidal magnets. This general setup can be seen in Fig. 2.3.\nEach sub-detector is composed mainly of three pieces, a barrel for high pT particles and two endcaps located symmetrically from the interaction point to optimise the solid angle coverage. Usually,\nthe transition regions between the barrels and the end-caps, also called the transition region, are used\nto pass the power cables and the readout cables of the devices.\nFirst, the tracker, also referred to as the Inner Detector (ID), bathes in a 2 T magnetic field\ngenerated by a surrounding solenoidal magnet. It is made of semi-conductor silicon vertex detectors\nin the inner layers (pixel and semi-conductor tracker) and of straws trackers in its outer part. Charged\nparticles, as they pass each layer, leave measurable hits that allow to reconstruct their trajectories\nand creation points (vertex) while their transverse momenta are deduced from their tracks deflection\nby the magnetic field.\nAfter comes the sampling calorimeters made of alternate layers of absorbers and active detector\nmedium. First is the electromagnetic (EM) calorimeter made of lead (absorber) and liquid argon\n(LAr) for the active medium. It measures with a high granularity and excellent performances in\nenergy and position resolution the electrons and photons. The hadronic calorimeter measures the\nenergy of hadrons and QCD jets. It is made in the barrel of steel plates (absorber) and scintillatortiles (active detector medium), in the end-cap both tile and LAr calorimeters are used.\nAround the hadronic calorimeter is the muon spectrometer bathing in the air-core toroid magnetic\nfield. The high bending power of the magnetic field provides an excellent muon momentum resolution\nusing three layers of high precision tracking chambers to detect the muon passage. Muons properties\nare measured using drift tubes and multiwire chambers. The spectrometer uses as well other chambers\nrelying on cathode-plate and multi-wire chambers to trigger for high pT muons events. The muon\ndetector defines the overall size of ATLAS which is \u2248 20 m of diameter and \u2248 45 m long. The total\nweight of the detector reaches \u2248 7000 tons.\nTrigger. The harvest of the data measured by those sub-detectors is achieved using a fast trigger.\nThe trigger system selects events displaying interesting signatures among the plethora of events\nproduced at the rate of \u223c 1 GHz at nominal luminosity. For the first time the collected statistic\nfor large scale processes such as W or Z production will be limited by the bandwidth and read out\nsystems rather than by the produced events. The trigger is split into three Levels (L), L1, L2 and the\nevent filter, the two last one being referred to as the high-level trigger. Each level refines the decision\noutgoing from the precedent level and, if necessary, apply additional selection criteria.\nThe L1 trigger treats subsets from each sub-detector information, it scans for high transverse\nmomentum muons, electrons, photons, jets, \u03c4 leptons decaying into hadrons as well as large missing\nand total transverse energies. It also spots in each event to regions of interests defined as regions\nwithin the detector displaying interesting features. The decision to accept/reject an event is made\nwithin 2.5 \u03bcs and decreases the rate of incoming events to \u223c 75 kHz. The L2 trigger reduces within\n\u223c 40 ms the events rate to \u223c 3.5 kHz based on full data information within the regions of interested\ninput by L1. The last stage of the event selection, made by the event filter, reduces the rate of events\nto \u223c 200 Hz. This step, lasting \u223c 4 s, is carried out offline using analysis procedure and supply an\nevent of size 1.3 Megabyte.\nAlready at this point we mention few trigger information relevant for both selection and analysis of\nW properties from Drell\u2013Yan production. More details will be given on these topics later on. Among\nfew other requirements, the trigger should be activated for isolated electrons/muons with high pT\nthreshold of the order of pT,l > 20 \u2212 25 GeV while the data from such events should be studied in the\nrange 30 GeV < pT,l < 50 GeV.\n\n\f2.2 The ATLAS detector\n\n49\n\nForward detectors. Also worth mentioning are three smaller detectors in the forward region associated to ATLAS. From the interaction point, at \u00b117 m is LUCID (LUminosity measurement using\n\u010cerenkov Integrating Detector), at \u00b1140 m is ZDC (Zero-Degree Calorimeter) and at \u00b1240 m is ALFA\n(Absolute Luminosity For ATLAS) LUCID and ALFA roles are to determine the luminosity delivered\nto ATLAS and ZDC to have a key role to determine the centrality of heavy ions collisions.\nFigure 2.4 concludes this overview by recapturing the interactions of some particles with the\ndifferent sub-detectors.\n\nFigure 2.4: Overview of some particles passage through the ATLAS tracker, electromagnetic calorimeter, hadronic\ncalorimeter and eventually through the first layers of the muon spectrometer. Toroidal magnets located at higher radii\nare not visible in this picture [CERN-GE-0803022 c CERN Geneva].\n\nThe rest of the Chapter presents the technology and geometry of each ATLAS sub-detectors.\nFirst the calorimeters and muon spectrometer are presented. In top of a general description, the\nlink of their role on the measurement of W in Drell\u2013Yan is mentioned mostly from the trigger point\nof view since the tracker, so far, does not have any trigger on its own. Hence the electromagnetic\ncalorimeter and muon spectrometer trigger efficiencies for events displaying respectively isolated high\npT electrons and muons are cited. These kind of studies associates as well E\n/ T due to the final state\nneutrino. However, since in the present analysis the latter is not taken into account, the E\n/ T trigger\nis not considered to be relevant although its influence on the results was controlled. More details will\nbe given in Chapter 5. In the second and final part, a detailed description of the inner detector is\ngiven. In what follows, dimensions of devices are given by their radial(longitudinal) extensions r(L)\nand their absolute pseudo-rapidity acceptance |\u03b7|.\n\n2.2.3\n\nCalorimetry\n\nBoth electromagnetic calorimeter (EMC) and hadronic calorimeter (HC) geometry, technology and\nperformances are reviewed. Their set up can be seen in Figs. 2.5 and 2.8.\n\n\f50\n\nThe ATLAS experiment\n\nFigure 2.5: Overview of the ATLAS calorimetry. Near the beam-pipe the tracker is visible, surrounding it is the EM\ncalorimeter and beyond the hadronic calorimeter. Both barrel and end-caps elements are displayed. [CERN-GE-0803015\nc CERN Geneva].\n\n(a)\n\nElectromagnetic calorimeter\n\nTechnology. The EMC [90, 91] is made of accordion shaped layers of lead plates-kapton electrodes\nbathing in liquid argon as depicted in Fig. 2.6. The accordion geometry, symmetric in \u03c6, presents\na full and crack-free azimuthal coverage. The readout of the high voltage electrodes are maintained\nat equal distance from two lead sheets using honeycomb spacers. A high energy electron or photon\nas it passes through an absorber looses energy respectively via bremsstrahlung e\u00b1 \u2192 e\u00b1 \u03b3 or pair\nproduction \u03b3 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 . These produced particles in their turn interact with the other absorbers\ncreating a shower of particles. Particles from this shower excite liquid argon from which ionised\nelectrons \u2013as they drift to the electrode\u2013 allow to find eventually the shape and the total energy\nyielded by the incoming electron/photon.\nGeometry. The barrel (1.25 m < r < 2.25 m, L = 6.4 m, |\u03b7| < 1.475, \u2265 22 X0 ) is made of two\nidentical half-barrels with the accordion waves running in the r axis. Both are stored with the\nsolenoid in the same cryostat.\nThe two end-caps (330 mm < r < 2098 mm, L = 63 cm, 1.375 < |\u03b7| < 3.2, \u2265 24 X0 ) are stored\nwith the hadronic end-caps and forward calorimeters in the same cryostat. Here the waves of the\naccordion are parallel to the z axis. Each end-caps are mechanically split into two coaxial wheels in\nan approximately projective geometry at |\u03b7| = 2.5. The external wheel end-cap (1.375 < |\u03b7| < 2.5)\ntogether with the barrel provide precision measurements with a granularity of the cells of the order\nof \u2206\u03b7 \u00d7 \u2206\u03c6 \u223c 0.025 \u00d7 0.025. Liquid argon presamplers are implemented upstream of both the barrel\nand external wheel end-cap in the aim to correct for the loss of energy of the electrons and photons\nbefore they enter the calorimetry.\nPerformances.

The hadronic calorimeter [90, 94] uses both LAr and scintillators tiles technology.\nThe tile calorimeter is used in the barrel. It is a sampling calorimeter made of alternate layers of\nsteel plates (absorbers) and scintillating tiles (active medium) orthogonal to the z axis (Fig. 2.8.(a)).\nIonising objects (hadrons or jets) as they pass through the tiles induce the production of ultra-violet\nscintillation light which is converted to visible light by wavelength-shifting fibres. The fibres are\ngrouped together and coupled to photo-multipliers. Just like for the EM calorimeter the shape and\nenergy of the object is measured as the object yields all its energy in form a shower.\nSampling calorimeter made of flat copper plates (absorber) and LAr (active medium) are used for\nthe end-cap calorimeter while the forward calorimeter uses both LAr in association with copper and\ntungsten (absorbers).\n\nGeometry. The tile calorimeter (2.28 m < r < 4.25 m, |\u03b7| < 1.7, \u2265 7.4 \u03bb) is made of one barrel\n(L = 5.8 m, |\u03b7| < 1.0) and two extended barrels (L = 2.6 m, 0.8 < |\u03b7| < 1.7).\nIn the forward pseudo-rapidity the hadronic end-cap (HEC) and forward calorimeter (FCal) are\nimplemented to enhance the hermetic confinement of the produced particles to refine the measurement\nof E\n/ T (Fig. 2.8.b). The end-cap calorimeter (r < 2030 mm, L = 1818 mm, 1.5 < |\u03b7| < 3.2) is split\nin a front wheel (HEC 1 : 372 \u2212 475 mm < r < 2030 mm) and a rear wheel (HEC 2 : 475 mm < r <\n2030 mm).\nThe forward calorimeter (3.1 < |\u03b7| < 4.9) measures the energy of the intense particles flux in\nthis forward region, it is divided in three layers of equal length, first an electromagnetic and then\ntwo hadronic calorimeters. It relies on copper\u2013LAr in the first layer (FCal 1) for electromagnetic\ncalorimetry and on tungsten-LAr in the two last hadronic calorimeters (FCal 2 & 3).\nThe granularity in the barrel and extended barrels is of the order of \u2206\u03b7 \u00d7 \u2206\u03c6 \u223c 0.1 \u00d7 0.1 and of\n\u2206\u03b7 \u00d7 \u2206\u03c6 \u223c 0.2 \u00d7 0.2 in the forward calorimeters.\n\n\f2.2 The ATLAS detector\n\n2.2.4\n\n53\n\nMuon system\n\nFigure 2.9: Overview of the ATLAS muon spectrometer [CERN-GE-0803017 c CERN Geneva].\nThe muon precision tracking instruments and the toroidal magnet are reviewed. Information\non the muon triggering relevant to the present analysis is given as well. An overview of the muon\nspectrometer can be seen in Fig. 2.9.\nTechnology. The bending of the muons is done in the r \u2212 z plan by a toroidal field which strength\ncan reach 3 T in the barrel and 6 T in the end-cap. Nonetheless, the magnetic field bending power\nis\nR\n~\ncharacterised rather by its integral over the track length inside the tracking volume BL \u2261 B * d ~l\n[ T m], where d ~l is an infinitesimal track portion. Large values of BL are necessary to make precise\nmeasurements of \u223c 1 TeV muon tracks.\nOver most of the pseudo-rapidity range, precise measurement of the track coordinates in the\nprincipal bending direction is provided by Monitored Drift Tubes (MDT). As muons pass through a\npressurized gas mixture filling the tubes, ionised electrons drift to the anode wire. The radius of the\nparticle passage in the tube is deduced using space drift\u2013time relation. Eventually, all collected radii\ngive the muon track as shown in Fig. 2.10.(a).\nFor larger pseudo-rapidity, Cathode Strip Chambers (CSC), which are multiwire proportional\nchambers with cathodes segmented into strips, are used due to their higher rate capability and time\nresolution. Both cathodes are segmented. The one with strips orthogonal to the direction of the\nwires measure the precision coordinate, while the other with strips parallels to the wires provides\nthe transverse coordinate. The position of the track is deduced by interpolating the charged induced\namong adjacent strips (Fig. 2.10.(b)).\nThe trigger chambers use Resistive Plate Chambers (RPC) in the barrel and Thin Gap Chambers (TGC) in the end-cap. In top of their triggering primer role, these chambers provides second\ncoordinate measures in the bending plane r \u2212 z to cross check the ones from the MDTs.\nGeometry. The magnetic field is generated in the barrel using three large air-core toroidal magnet\n(9.4 m < r < 20.1 m, L = 25.3 m, |\u03b7| < 1.4, BL = 1.5 \u2212 5.5 T m), each of them composed by eight\ncoils arranged radially and symmetrically around the z axis. In the end-cap two smaller magnets\n(1.65 m < r < 10.7 m, L = 5 m, 1.6 < |\u03b7| < 2.7, BL = 1.0 \u2212 7.5 T m) are inserted into both ends\n\n\f54\n\nThe ATLAS experiment\n\n\u03bc\n\nIonised drifting electrons\nRadius deduced from\nspace-drift time relation\n\nTube\nAnode wire\n\n\u03bc\n\n(a)\n\nFigure 2.10: Principle of operation for MDT (a) and CSC devices (b) [Figure (b) taken in [82]].\n\nof the barrel toroid.

In the barrel, MDT chambers are arranged in three concentric cylindrical shells\n(|\u03b7| < 2.0) around the beam axis at radii of approximately 5 m, 7.5 m and 10 m. In the end-cap they\nare confined inside large wheels (|\u03b7| < 2.7) perpendicular to the z axis at z \u2248 7.4 m, 10.8 m, 14 m\nand 21 m. CSCs (2.0 < |\u03b7| < 2.7) are arranged in wheels with approximate radial orientation of\nthe wires. RPCs and TGCs are respectively used in the barrel (|\u03b7| < 1.05) and in the end-caps\n(1.05 < |\u03b7| < 2.7), their implementation based on the one of the MDT and CSC modules. There are\nin total three layers of RPCs in the barrel and three layers of TGCs in the end-cap.\n\nEfficiency\n\nEfficiency\n\nTrigger on muons. Again, like for the electron the muon trigger efficiencies has already reached\na plateau at 40 GeV where the data starts to enter the analysis (Fig. 2.11). Still here, contrary\nto the EMC, some asymmetries can arise between \u03bc+ and \u03bc\u2212 due to the toroidal topology of the\nmagnetic field which, for a given side of the detector, is in-bending for a charge and out-bending\nfor the opposite charge.

Their implementation is displayed with details on Figs. 2.12 and 2.13.\nSince the analysis strategy to decrease systematic errors relies on the possibility to invert the magnetic\nfield of the solenoid, mentions on the drift of charge carriers in the modules were found worth to be\nnoticed.\nThe Inner Detector is designed to provide a fine pattern recognition, an excellent momentum\nresolution and both primary and secondary vertex measurements for charged particles tracks displaying pT > 0.5 GeV and within the pseudo-rapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.5. This is achieved by using three\nindependent but complementary sub-detectors. At inner radii, high-resolution pattern recognition\nperformances are done by discrete space-points from silicon pixel layers and stereo pairs of silicon\nmicro-strip (SCT) layers. At larger radii the Transition Radiation Tracker (TRT), made of gaseous\nproportional counters embedded in radiator material, allows continuous track following. Each track\nleaves at least 7 hits in the precision tracking (pixel and SCT) and an average of 30 hits in the TRT.\nThe central solenoid with the pixel, SCT and TRT detectors are now described.\nCentral solenoid\n\n2.0\n\n2.0\n\n1.5\n\n1.5\n\nBz [T]\n\nBr [T]\n\n(a)\n\n1.0\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\nz [cm]\n\n300\n0\n\n25\n\n50\n\n75\n\n100\n\nr [cm]\n\n(a)\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\nz [cm]\n\n300\n0\n\n25\n\n50\n\n75\n\n100\n\nr [cm]\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 2.14: Mapping of the radial (a) and longitudinal (b) components of the magnetic field generated by the central\nsolenoid [Taken in [99]].\n\nThe solenoid coil, surrounding the tracker, generates a magnetic field to bend the tracks of charged\nparticles emerging from the interaction point allowing, with the tracker instruments, to identify and\nmeasure their transverse momenta.\nThe solenoid coil [100] (1.23 m < r < 1.28 m, L = 5.8 m) provides a magnetic field\n~ = Br ~er + Bz ~ez .\nB\n\n(2.14)\n\nIn that equation, Bz is the main component of the field and the radial component Br , optimally\nnull at z = 0, grows with |z| due to border effects and the influence of iron in the tile calorimeter\n(Fig. 2.14). Charged particles are bent predominantly in the r \u2212 \u03c6 plane with bending powers of\n2 T m at \u03b7 = 0 decreasing to 0.5 T m at |\u03b7| < 2.5. Besides, since the solenoid length is shorter than\nthe tracker the field inhomogeneities in the forward region need to be accounted using a field map in\nboth simulation and reconstruction.\nOne aspect in the present study relies on the capability of inverting the magnetic field of the\nsolenoid which, although not programmed so far, is possible as stated in Ref. [100]. The consequences\nof this operation, from the physics analysis point of view, will be discussed in the analysis in Chapter 5.\n\n\f2.3 The ATLAS inner detector\n(b)\n\n57\n\nPixel detector\n\nCharged particle\n\nn-substrate\n\np+ -implantation\nHoles\nn+ -pixel\n\ne\u2212\n\n~\nE\n\np-spray\n\nRead out chip\nBump bonds\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 2.15: Pixel module structure of the ATLAS tracker (a) and principle of operation (b) [(a) taken in [82]].\nThe measurements from the pixel detector [97] are fundamental as they provide information on\ncharged particles before they yield energy to the apparatus. Silicon detectors are used to provide\nfine vertexes information with high granularity [101]. The cells are made, as shown on Fig. 2.15.(a),\nusing silicon sensor layers of size width \u00d7 length = 50 \u00d7 400 \u03bcm2 segmented in both width and length\nto provide the pixel information. Incoming charged particles ionise pairs of electrons/holes in the\nsilicon. The bias voltage applied in the silicon makes electrons drift to the n+ -side readouts. Bump\nbonds transmit the collected charge to the front end electronic allowing to decipher which pixel was\nhit (Fig. 2.15.(b)).\nPixels modules \u2013all identical in design\u2013 are dispatched between a central and two forwards parts.\nThe central part is made of three concentric cylinders and the forward one are made each of three\ndisks orthogonal to the z axis. This provide for each particle track 3 hits.\nIn the central barrel, as can be seen in Fig. 2.13.(b), modules are tilted in \u03c6 with respect to the\ntangent position. This tilt provides an overlap of the active area of the modules in the \u03c6-direction\nwhich enhance the hermetic confinement of particles. It also ensures a better spatial resolution via\n~ field via Lorentz force\u2013 direction with\nthe alignment of the effective charge drift \u2013induced by the B\nthe particle trajectory [102] as seen in Fig. 2.16.\nLayers are segmented like r\u2206\u03c6 \u00d7 \u2206z = 10 \u03bcm \u00d7 115 \u03bcm. In the forward barrel, that same segmentation correspondence is r\u2206\u03c6 \u00d7 \u2206r = 10 \u03bcm \u00d7 115 \u03bcm.\n(c)\n\nSemi-Conductor tracker\n\nThe SCT [97, 103] is based upon silicon micro-strip detector. Each module is made of two silicon sensor\nlayers segmented in strips put back to back and rotated by 40 mrad to enhance the z measurement\n(Fig. 2.17.(a)). The principle of operation is similar to pixel detector modules. Here the holes drift\nto the strips while the electrons drift to the back of the sensor. The strips are read out by a front-end\nchip, which measures the induction signal of the drifting holes/electrons pairs. Especially as shown on\nFig. 2.17.(b) the Lorentz drift in each layer are working in opposite directions. The position of the hit\nis averaged offline from the two sides hit positions. The active area is width \u00d7 length = 61.6 \u00d7 62 mm2\nand the modules are segmented in both width and length.\n\n\f58\n\nThe ATLAS experiment\nCharged particle\n\nDrifting e\u2212\n\nRead out electrodes \u2261 pixels\n\n~\nB\nTilt angle\n\n(a)\n\nSilicon layer\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 2.16: Schematic representation \u2013simplified with respect to Fig. 2.15.(b)\u2013 of the electrons drift in a barrel pixel\nmodule with no tilt (a) and with a tilt (b) that aligns the charge drift carriers direction with the one of the charged\nparticle.

In the barrel modules are slightly tilted from the tangent position (Fig. 2.13.(b)) for the\nsame reasons than for the pixel detector. The segmentation in the barrel is r\u2206\u03c6 \u00d7 \u2206z = 580 \u03bcm \u00d7\n17 \u03bcm. In the end-cap, modules are also mounted to display some overlap and the corresponding\nsegmentation is of r\u2206\u03c6 \u00d7 \u2206r = 580 \u03bcm \u00d7 17 \u03bcm.\n(d)\n\nTransition radiation tracker\n\nThe TRT [97] assures continuous tracking as well as electrons identification. Even if it is not as\nprecise as the silicon trackers its long lever arm plays an important role in the momentum resolution.\nThe TRT is made of layers of gas filled straws interleaved with transition radiation material. A\ncharged particle passing through the straw ionise the electrons of the gas mixture (Fig. 2.18.(b)). A\nlarge potential difference is applied between the straw wall and the wire. The anode wire collects the\nenergy of the ionised electrons (Fig. 2.18.(b)). Also, charged particles as they pass trough materials\nof different dielectric constant (radiator \u2192 straw) radiate photons proportionally to their Lorentz\n\u03b3 factor. Part of the gas mixture in the straw is sensitive to photons and in consequence this ionisation\nenergy adds up to the collection of the one induced by the incoming particle.

The TRT only provides information in r\u2206\u03c6 with an accuracy\nof 130 \u03bcm.\nIn the barrel the straws are parallel to the z axis and arranged in three cylindrical rings. In\neach end-cap the wires are aligned to the radial direction and arranged in three sets of identical\nand independent wheels. Again the precise dimensions and pseudo-rapidity coverage can be seen in\nFigs. 2.12.\n\n2.3.2\n\nTrack fitting and general performances\n\nThe track fitting is realised in three stages. First the raw data from the pixel/SCT and TRT detectors\nare respectively converted into clusters and calibrated circles. The SCT clusters are converted to\nspace-points using a combination of the cluster from both sides of SCT modules (cf. Fig. 2.17.(b)).\nThen comes the track finding stage where algorithms [104, 96] essentially follow pattern recognition\nstarting from the innermost pixel layers and goes outwards to the TRT. These algorithms, based on\nKalman filter techniques [105] and Global-\u03c72 [106], perform recognition of helices among the hits in\nthe tracker. In the final stage primary vertexes are resolved. Also tracking information from the\nmuon spectrometer is used as well to enhance the data on muons. In the present work the expected\nstand-alone performances of the tracker are used exclusively.\nThe ID performances in pT , \u03b8 and \u03c6 can be parametrised using Gaussian functions (cf. Ref. [99]\n\u00a7 3.3.1.6) where, up to the approximation the material and the solenoid field are uniform in r writes\n\u03c31/pT\n\n= 3.6 \u00d7 10\u22124 \u2295\n\n\u03c3cotan \u03b8 = 0.7 \u00d7 10\u22123 \u2295\n\n1.3 \u00d7 10\u22122\n\u221a\n(true)\npT\nsin \u03b8(true)\n(true)\n\npT\n\n\u03c3\u03c6 = 0.075 \u00d7 10\u22123 \u2295\n(true)\n\nwhere pT\n\n2.0 \u00d7 10\u22123\n\nsin3/2 \u03b8(true)\n\n[GeV\u22121 ],\n\n(2.16)\n\n,\n\n1.8 \u00d7 10\u22123\n\u221a\n(true)\npT\nsin \u03b8(true)\n\n(2.15)\n\n[rad].\n\n(2.17)\n\nare in GeV and (true) superscript means a kinematic is considered at the generator level.\n\n\f60\n\n2.4\n2.4.1\n\nThe ATLAS experiment\n\nThe weak modes affecting the inner detector\nMisalignment and definition of the weak modes\n\nThe tracker is build into an a priori perfect \"blue-print\" configuration, but in reality modules assembly differs from such an ideal picture due to mounting limitations, mechanical stress, temperature\nvariations, sagging due to gravity, etc. Since the tracker relies on the relative hits positions to measure the particles momenta and vertexes these small misalignment spoil the relevancy of reconstructed\ntracks. Since the module positions cannot be touched after their assembly modules misalignment are\naccounted by performing a mapping of the detector shape and module positions to correct the collected data. This procedure is called the alignment. Since some of the constraints on the tracker are\ntime dependent this alignment survey must be continually updated.\nThe alignment of the tracker is realised using two kind of methods : hardware-based and trackbased methods. Hardware methods make in situ measurement of the shape of the support structure\nand its change over time. Track based alignment requires, using the least squares principle, that the\nmeasurements in the detector are consistent with the assumed track model, i.e. follows the expected\n~ field and the scattering is consistent with the known amount of\ntrack trajectory in the given B\nmaterial.\nStill, despite these surveys some deformations are such that the fitted track even if being relevant\nfrom the tracking algorithm point of view \u2013i.e. an helix is recognised\u2013 nonetheless deviates from the\nreal track. These deformations can be \u2013in a first approximation\u2013 represented by a set of 9 simple\nand independent distortions called the weak modes [107], parametrised using global deformations on\nthe tracker. Due to the symmetry of the problem, the parametrisation is made in the cylindrical\ncoordinate system, hence the combination of deformations in r, \u03c6 and z directions folded with \u2206r,\n\u2206\u03c6 and \u2206z variations gives 9 weak modes. The total misalignment of the tracker is a combination\nof these 9 modes gathered in Fig. 2.19.\nMore details on the alignment and weak modes can be found in Refs. [107, 108, 71].\n\n\u2206r\n\n\u2206\u03c6\n\n\u2206z\n\nRadial expansion\n\nCurl\n\nTelescope\n\nElliptical\n\nClamshell\n\nSkew\n\nBowing\n\nTwist\n\nLongitudinal\nexpansion\n\nr\n\n\u03c6\n\nz\n\nFigure 2.19: Weak modes affecting at the first order the alignment of the tracker.

In CDF II systematic errors on MW are of the same order than the statistical errors,\n(stat.)\n(sys.)\ni.e. \u03b4MW = \u03b4MW = 34 MeV while at the LHC statistical errors will be of the order of 5 MeV already\nfor one year at low luminosity. For that reason the weak modes have to be addressed more thoroughly\nwithin ATLAS in regard of the difficulties encountered in the CDF II tracker (cf. Appendix 2.A).\nFor example, considering again our interest in W production, a requested precision of 25 MeV for\nthe measurement of the MW constrains track parameters and momentum uncertainties. For that\npurpose the degradation of the high pT tracks parameters due to misalignment have to be smaller\nthan 20 % while the systematic uncertainty on the momentum resolution needs to be smaller than\n0.1 % [99, 110].\nHere the focus is made on the predominant modes increasing the error of MW + \u2212MW \u2212 . Like it will\nbe explained thoroughly in Chapter 4 the present work is based on the knowledge of the transverse\nmomenta pT,l of charged leptons decaying from single W bosons. Hence the attention is cast on\nmodes affecting the reconstruction of positive and negative transverse tracks. Modes involving \u2206z\ndeformations are not considered as they do not degrade the resolution of pT,l , this leaves \u2206r and \u2206\u03c6\nmodes which are discussed below. Two kind of biases are considered, the ones biasing the positive\nand negative charged particles tracks curvatures in the same direction (coherent biases) and the one\naffecting them in opposite directions (incoherent biases) the latter being the most important source\nof errors for MW + \u2212 MW \u2212 . In what follows no values are estimated, only the relative qualitative\namplitudes between coherent and incoherent biases.\nThe modes amplitudes biases are noted \u03b5 and tagged using the 2 \u00d7 2 matrix form displayed in\nFig. 2.19, i.e. using the notation r or \u2206r \u2192 1, \u03c6 or \u2206\u03c6 \u2192 2 and z or \u2206z \u2192 2.

For this mode, the effect of the gravity will most likely flatten the tracker as\ndepicted in Fig. 2.19. In the region where the nominal radius of the tracker is larger (\u2206r > 0)\npositive and negative particle tracks curvature are overestimated. On the contrary tracks are getting\nmore straight in regions where the tracker's nominal radius decreases (\u2206r < 0). Eventually these two\neffects should compensate each other and leave a residual coherent bias such that \u03b521 < \u03b511 .\nz\u2206r : bowing. Here, for a given z coordinate positive and negative reconstructed tracks will be\nmore straight (bent) if the tracker is expanding (contracting) with respect to its nominal radius.\nBiases coming from expansions are counter balanced by the one arising from contractions. The final\nbias from the bowing should be a residue from the averaging of these two opposite constraints. In\nany of those cases, again, the coherent bias should verify \u03b531 < \u03b511 .\n(b)\n\n\u2206\u03c6 modes\n\nr\u2206\u03c6 : curling. The curling of the tracker gives incoherent biases.

To illustrate the twist, a rotation of the tracker \u2206\u03c6 < 0 of the left side and of \u2206\u03c6 > 0\non the right side are considered. Based on the understanding of the curl mode, on the left side positive\ntracks are believed to be more bent while negative tracks are believed to be more straight. On the\nright side this effect is reversed. Just like for the bowing, antagonists modes of the same amplitudes\ncancel each other. Eventually the most important twist should contribute with a term like \u03b532 < \u03b512 .\n(c)\n\nGlobal effect of the 6 previous modes\n\nIn conclusion, the reconstructed positively and negatively charged tracks should be biased like\n(rec.)\n\n\u03c1T,l+\n\n(rec.)\n\u03c1T,l\u2212\n\n(smr.)\n\n= \u03c1T,l+ (1 + \u03b5\u2206r + \u03b5\u2206\u03c6 ),\n=\n\n(smr.)\n\u03c1T,l\u2212 (1\n\n+ \u03b5\u2206r \u2212 \u03b5\u2206\u03c6 ),\n\n(2.22)\n(2.23)\n\nwhere \u03b5\u2206r and \u03b5\u2206\u03c6 are respectively the global coherent bias from \u2206r and \u2206\u03c6 modes, i.e.\n\u03b5\u2206r = \u03b511 + \u03b521 + \u03b531 ,\n\n(2.24)\n\n\u03b5\u2206\u03c6 = \u03b522 + \u03b532 .\n\n(2.25)\n\nAgain, let us repeat that only qualitative estimations are made here. This is justified as in our\nwork these biases will be implemented with large worst case scenario values to improve the robustness\nof our proposed analysis scheme.\n\n\f2.A W mass charge asymmetry and tracker misalignment in CDF II\n\n2.A\n\n63\n\nW mass charge asymmetry and tracker misalignment in CDF II\n(About the difficulties to measure MW because of tracker misalignment)\n\"You all remember how during your studies you were taught a solid could be\ndescribed by only six degrees of freedom. Well. Forget about it. It's crap.\"\nCTEQ-MCnet Summer School 2008 - Standard Model lectures\nTom LeCompte\n\n2.A.1\n\nContext of the measurement of the W mass at CDF\n\nThe CDF detector used in Tevatron Run II, labeled CDF II [109], is a multipurpose detector nominally\nforward-backward symmetric with respect\nto the interaction point where protons and anti-protons\n\u221a\ncollide at a center of mass energy of S = 1.96 TeV. It is made, starting from the beam-pipe, of\nan inner tracker bathing in a 1.4 T solenoidal magnetic field, an electromagnetic calorimeter followed\nby a hadronic calorimeter to contain and measure respectively the energies of electrons/photons and\nhadrons. Finally a muon spectrometer surrounds the previous apparatus to measure the properties\nof muons. The data is read-out on-line using the decisions of a three level trigger system.\nThe measurement of MW [51, 56] in CDF II is achieved using the tracker data for the muons and\nboth tracker and electromagnetic calorimeter data for electrons. The acceptance and resolutions for\ncentral electrons and muons are the same which means both channels enter with the same weight in\nthe analysis.\nThe extraction of MW is addressed via the usual observables such as pT,l , mT, l \u03bdl and p/T,l and via\nmuon and electronic decays of the W . Along all these information the difference between the masses\nof the positive and negative W bosons is estimated as a mean of consistency check. Actually this\nlast measurement is not to be apprehended as a real attempt to measure MW + \u2212 MW \u2212 . Rather than\nthat is has to be understood that the measurement is entirely focused on MW and that the effects\nresponsible for the low precision on MW + \u2212 MW \u2212 were at no time addressed by the authors as long\nat it does not have a major role for the determination of MW .

The trick is that incoherent biases are at work between the positively and negatively charged\nparticle tracks and they get drastically reduced when both charges are merged.\nThe next subsection describes briefly the CDF II central outer tracker used for the W measurement. After that a recapitulation of how the tracker misalignment affects charged particles curvature\nis made. This shows how the experience from Tevatron physicists guided us to address, aware of\nthe LHC/ATLAS original features, the relevant weak modes for a future dedicated measurement of\nMW + \u2212 MW \u2212 in ATLAS. It also explains why so far all experimental measurements of MW + \u2212 MW \u2212\ndisplay such a low accuracy.\n\n\u2022\n\n\f\u2022\n\n64\n\n2.A.2\n\nThe ATLAS experiment\n\nDescription of the CDF Central Outer Tracker\n\nThe CDF configuration is such that we borrow for its description the same conventions adopted for\nATLAS (cf. \u00a7 1.3). The CDF II uses silicon at lower radii and drift tubes technologies afterward. The\nsilicon detector is not detailed since its data was not used for the determination of MW .\nAround the silicon tracker is an open-cell drift chamber, the COT [112] which span the radial\nrange 40 cm < r < 137 cm and extend longitudinally for |z| < 155 cm (|\u03b7| \u2248 0.1).\nThe COT, as displayed in Fig. 2.21.(a) is made of eight concentric \"super-layers\" separated in\nazimuth into cells. Each cell, as shown in Fig. 2.21.(b), is made of sense wires and potential wires\nimmersed in an ambient gas mixture. Ionised electrons from the passage of high energy charged\nparticles drift under the influence of the electrostatic field to the sense wires and yield their energy\nwhich allow to decipher the particle hit position. The sense wires are attached at each extremities to\nend-plates which hold them into a string position. The tilt angle of the cells aims to make it so the\nionised electrons travels approximately in azimuth to the sense wires under the combined influence\nof the solenoid magnetic field and of the local electrostatic field. Let us note that the cells move from\ntheir nominal geometry under the influence of gravity which makes field sheets and wires sag. This\neventually implies that the sense wires deflect toward a particular field sheet. To decrease this effect\na support rod at z = 0 connects the sense wires at the center of the detector.\n\nPotential wires\nSense wires\nShaper wires\nBare Mylar\nGold on Mylar (Field Panel)\n\nr\n\n52\n\n54\n\n56\n\n58\n\n60\n\n62\n\n64\n\nSL2\n\n(a)\n\n66\n\nr (cm)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 2.21: Structure of the CDF II central outer tracker [Taken in [109]].\n\n2.A.3\n\nInfluence of tracker misalignment on the W mass charge asymmetry\n\nWe adopt in the rest of this Appendix the conventions of Ref. [51] to address the curvature c of a\ncharged particle track in the r \u2212 \u03c6 plane. It is defined like\nc \u2261 q/(2 R),\n\n(2.26)\n\n\f2.A W mass charge asymmetry and tracker misalignment in CDF II\n\n65\n\nwhere q is the charge of the particle and R is the radius of the track in the r \u2212 \u03c6 plan. Charged\nleptons have their transverse momenta deduced from c which is measured by the hits left in the COT.\nFor that purpose the position of the cells needs to be determined precisely to have a good accuracy\nfor the momentum scale. The calibration of this momentum scale is determined starting with the\na priori position of the cells. Then in situ measures correct for the electrostatic and gravity sag\nbiases, cosmic ray muon data allow to add up in situ corrections and finally track based corrections\nare applied using data calibration. For these last corrections first comes the study W \u2192 e \u03bd to\nreduce relative curvatures biases between positive and negative particles and finally absolute scale\ndata calibration using J/\u03c8, \u03a5 and Z bosons decays to \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 .\nThe reconstructed track curvature cr can be expressed as a function of the true curvature ct in\na Taylor expansion around zero which is justified by the high pT of the charged leptons of interest\n(ct \u2248 0.02 \u2212 0.03). It reads\ncr = \u03b51 + (1 + \u03b52 ) ct + \u03b53 c2t + \u03b54 c3t + . . . ,\n\n(2.27)\n\nwhich now allows us to consider the case of two positively and negatively charged leptons respectively\nof curvatures cr,+ and cr,\u2212 , having the same true transverse momentum (i.e. ct,\u2212 = \u2212ct,+ ). Their\nreconstructed tracks are written\ncr,+ = \u03b51 + (1 + \u03b52 ) ct,+ + \u03b53 c2t,+ + \u03b54 c3t,+ + . . . ,\n\n(2.28)\n\ncr,\u2212 = \u03b51 \u2212 (1 + \u03b52 ) ct,+ + \u03b53 c2t,+ \u2212 \u03b54 c3t,+ + . . . ,\n\n(2.29)\n\nNow, remembering the goal is to eventually merge positive and negative channels for the extraction\nof MW , flipping the sign of the curvature in Eq. (2.29) (i.e. cr,\u2212 \u2192 \u2212cr,\u2212 ) to get rid of the charge\nsign and averaging this new expression with Eq. (2.28) gives an average track curvature\n1\n2 (cr,+\n\n\u2212 cr,\u2212 ) = (1 + \u03b52 ) ct,+ + \u03b54 c3t,+ .\n\n(2.30)\n\nWith that development we see all terms of even power of ct are cancelled when averaging, the term\nlinear in ct scales the true curvature and is deduced from momentum calibration. The term \u03b54 c3t,+ is\nthe first one to affect the determination of MW but it can be neglected because of the high transverse\nmomentum of the leptons. On the other hand, the direct average of the signed curvatures (Eqs. (2.28\u2013\n2.29)) that should ideally be equal to zero, leads to constraints on \u03b51 , indeed\n1\n2 (cr,+\n\n+ cr,\u2212 ) \u2261 \u03b51 + \u03b53 c2t,+ + . . . ,\n\u2248 \u03b51 ,\n\n(2.31)\n(2.32)\n\nwhere in the last line higher order terms are neglected compared to \u03b51 and because as we saw they are\nnot worth to be considered for a measurement of MW . Then, \u03b51 is constrained using data calibration\nsince the relative difference between (E/p)e+ \u2212(E/p)e\u2212 should be zero in the absence of misalignment.\nThe parametrisation of Eq. (2.32) can be written like\n1\n2 (cr,+\n\n+ cr,\u2212 ) = a0 + a1 cotan \u03b8 + a2 cotan 2 \u03b8 + b1 sin(\u03c6 + 0.1) + b3 sin(3 \u03c6 + 0.5),\n\n(2.33)\n\nwhere the terms a0 , a1 and a2 can be interpreted as distortions of the COT.\nFigure 2.22 illustrates these distortions as a function of the more intuitive \u03b8 observable. Using\nthe vocabulary of weak modes (cf. \u00a7 2.4), the term in a0 corresponds to a curl of the tracker while\nthe term a1 corresponds to a twist between the left and right end-plates. The term proportional to\na2 goes beyond the first order approximation of the weak modes and is characteristic of the COT\nconstruction, it corresponds to a curl of second order where the left and right end-plates are being\nrotated in the same \u03c6 direction but the center of the tracker is maintained to its original position by\nthe support rod. The terms in b1 and b3 corresponds to mis-measurements of the beam position.\nFigure 2.23 shows now the tracker misalignment consequences on (E/p)e+ \u2212 (E/p)e\u2212 before and\nafter corrections in function of cotan \u03b8.\n\n\u2022\n\n\f66\n\nThe ATLAS experiment\nBiases on positive and negative tracks in the COT in function of \u03b8\n(a0 \u00b1 \u03b4a0)\n: curl\n(a1 \u00b1 \u03b4a1) cot \u03b8 : twist\n(a2 \u00b1 \u03b4a2) cot2 \u03b8 : curl2\n\n(cr,+ + cr,\u2212)/2 [\u00d710\u22127cm\u22121]\n\n3\n2\n1\n0\n\u22121\n\u22122\n\u22123\n\n\u03c0/4\n\n\u03b8COT\n\n\u03c0/2\n\u03b8 [rad]\n\n3 \u03c0/4\n\n\u03c0 \u2212 \u03b8COT\n\nFigure 2.22: Representation of the spatial distortion of the CDF II COT in function of \u03b8.\n0.02\n\nE/p (positrons - electrons)\n\n\u2022\n\n0.01\n\n0\n\n-0.01\n\nCOT cell and wire alignment\nWith track-level corrections\n\n-0.02\n\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\ncot \u03b8\n\nFigure 2.23: (E/p)e+ \u2212 (E/p)e\u2212 in function of cotan \u03b8 before and after corrections [Taken in [109]].\nIn conclusion, this measurement dedicated to extract MW merges both W + and W \u2212 measurement\nwhich gives data where half of the tracks are biased in one direction and the over half of the same\namount but in the opposite direction. Eventually all those corrections lead to a precision on tracker\nmomentum resolution of \u2206p/p \u2248 \u22121.50 \u00d7 10\u22123 which in turn leads for all pT,l , mT, l \u03bdl and p/T,\u03bdl fits\nto a systematic error of 17 MeV for the measurement of MW . But, when performing fit analysis for\nseparated W + and W \u2212 the curl distortion (a0 and a2 ) give rise as it was seen in the core the Chapter\nto incoherent biases between the positively and negatively charged tracks curvature responsible for\nthe important difference of the order of \u2248 2 \u03c3. From that experience we can state that the LHC\ncapabilities and a dedicated measurement strategy should considerably improve the accuracy on the\nvalue MW + \u2212 MW \u2212 .\n\n\fChapter 3\n\nThe Monte Carlo event generator\nWINHAC\nveillant\n\ndoutant\n\nroulant\n\nbrillant et m\u00e9ditant\navant de s'arr\u00eater\n\u00e0 quelque point dernier qui le sacre\nToute Pens\u00e9e emets un Coup de D\u00e9s\n\nUn coup de d\u00e9s jamais n'abolira le hasard\nSt\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9\n\nSo far a description of the theoretical and experimental context in which the prospect for a\nmeasurement of MW + \u2212 MW \u2212 have been given. This Chapter describes the tools that were used for\nthat purpose, which consist mostly of a description of the Monte Carlo event generator WINHAC used\nto simulate the production of W bosons in Drell\u2013Yan. The other tools entering in the generation and\nthe analysis steps are also described briefly.\nThis Chapter is divided into three parts. The first one, after reminding the gist of Monte Carlo\nmethods, describes the physics implemented inside WINHAC. The second part presents the work done\nwithin this thesis to implement WINHAC inside the ATLAS software. The reader interested only in\nthe physics thread can skip this technical part in a first reading. Indeed, to the use of the full and\nrefine ATLAS software, a lighter framework was preferred to make the studies presented in Chapter 4\nand 5. This personal framework is eventually presented in the third part of the Chapter.\n\n3.1\n3.1.1\n\nThe Monte Carlo event generator WINHAC\nMonte Carlo methods\n\nMonte Carlo (MC) methods [113] provide in high energy physics efficient solutions to deal with\nnumerical integration and, due to their very stochastic nature, to simulate inelastic scatterings for\nboth phenomenological and experimental specific needs. The principles of MC procedure is reviewed\nin a nutshell.\n\n\f68\n(a)\n\nThe Monte Carlo event generator WINHAC\nPrinciple of Monte Carlo methods.\n\nStarting with one dimension, the numerical integration of a function f between a and b can be recast\nas the product of the integration range b \u2212 a by the average of the integrand over it, that is\nI =\n\nZ\n\nb\n\nf (x) dx,\n\na\n\n= (b \u2212 a) hf ia,b .\n\n(3.1)\n(3.2)\n\nThis last expression can be approximated using a discrete number of points N within the range [a, b],\ngiving then\nN\n1 X\nI \u2248 IN \u2261 (b \u2212 a) \u00d7\nf (xi ).\n(3.3)\nN\ni=1\n\nTwo types of methods can be distinguished to evaluate IN . The first one consists essentially to slice\nregularly the integration range, these are called numerical quadratures. A broad range of refinements\nexist to increase the accuracy and convergence speed of the result (see e.g. [114]). Among them let\nus mention the trapezium and the Simpson rules which accuracies in one dimension are respectively\nconverging like \u221d 1/N 2 and \u221d 1/N 4 . The second approach consists to pick up N random points\nin [a, b] to approximate hf ia,b . This is the principle of Monte Carlo procedure, which in the one\n\u221a\ndimension case display a convergence \u221d 1/ N .\nWhen the dimension of the integral increases to a higher dimension, say d, quadrature integration\nmethods become very cumbersome as the integration volume, or phase space to already adopt physics\nvocabulary, needs to be split into N d bits. Thus, the trapezium and Simpson methods converge now\nlike \u221d 1/N 2/d and \u221d 1/N 4/d whereas for the\u221aMC integration by still picking up N random points\nin the phase space keeps a convergence \u221d 1/ N . Then, Monte Carlo may be slow but their speed\nconvergence is independent of the dimension of the integral.\nSince at the LHC the typical number of produced particles in an inelastic scattering is of the order\nof n \u223c 1, 000 it implies a dimension d = 3n \u2212 4 where the subtraction of 4 to the degrees of freedom\nis a consequence of the energy/momentum conservation.\n(b)\n\nMonte Carlo in High Energy Physics.\n\nComing back to high energy physics, estimating the probability of occurrence of a LHC reaction\nA + B \u2192 C + D demands the computation of its cross section which can be roughly written\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ\nd\u03c3\n\u03c3=\nd \u03a6,\n(3.4)\nd=3n \u22124 d \u03a6\nwhere d \u03a6 is an infinitesimal element of the phase space of the process and d \u03c3/d \u03a6 is calculated with\nperturbative QCD/EW/BSM along with the relevant and available higher corrections depending on\nthe nature of the process. Let us emphasise that here, picking up a random element d \u03a6 corresponds\nto a particular physical configuration for the event, that is four-momenta of the colliding partons,\nof the decaying particles as well as other partons and photons which have been radiated. Hence,\nthe record of these random d \u03a6 elements, in top of helping to compute \u03c3, represents a collection of\nevents which can be kept and used to plot afterward any desired distribution for an observable a in\nthe form d \u03c3/d a. Note this would not be possible with quadrature procedures where from the start\nthe calculus should be aimed to resolve a particular distribution. This collected events are referred\nto as \"weighted events\" as they are indeed weighted by the theoretical prediction d \u03c3/d \u03a6 associated\nto their production.\nNonetheless, these weighted events are not a simulation of real physics processes. Indeed in nature\na physical event do not come with the information whether it is frequent or rare, only harvesting\nlarge enough data allows to see it. Still, from the simulation of weighted events a simple trick can be\n\n\f3.1 The Monte Carlo event generator WINHAC\n\n69\n\nused to emulate the outcome of unweighted events, that is events with a weight of 1. The principle\nis the following. In a local region of phase space a maximum MAX is determined for the integrand,\ni.e. MAX > d \u03c3/d \u03a6. When a weighted event is generated a random number r is draw in the range\n[0, 1] then\n- If r < (d \u03c3/d \u03a6)/MAX the event is accepted with a weight of 1.\n- If r > (d \u03c3/d \u03a6)/MAX the event is simply rejected.\nThis rejection method allows to produce events with the same frequency of occurrence than in reality.\nHistograms produced with weighted and unweighted events are the same in the asymptotic limit\nN \u2192 +\u221e (in practice when N is large enough so the Central Limit Theorem can be applied). Let us\nnote this trick is possible because the integrand is positive definite which is true only at LO in QCD,\nthe QCD NLO treatment becomes then very delicate , e.g. Ref. [115].\nMonte Carlo event generators opens, from the experimentalist point of view, a wide range of\npossibilities. During the generation, acceptance cuts as well as detector smearing on the generator\npredictions can be applied which justify their extensive use in both R&D prospects and real data\nanalysis.\nAlso, worth mentioning is the generation of random numbers. It is impossible for an algorithm\nto generate random numbers since, by definition, its behaviour is deterministic by essence. Hence\nrandom numbers are in fact sequence of pseudo-random numbers outgoing small algorithms. The\nquality of these sequence of number comes from their periodicity \u2013the time it takes to repeat the\nseries\u2013 and some short-range correlations between the generated numbers (see e.g. Ref. [116]). To\nbetter emulate the non correlation between several simulated data, different long sequences can be\ngenerated using different seeds in the algorithm initialisation. In the rest, for convenience, the term\nrandom is used instead of pseudo-random.\nWe can distinguish two types of Monte Carlo, the one using the MC technique only for integration\nand the other which profit of MC properties to simulate physics processes. The latter are referred to\nas \"event generator\" or simply \"generators\".\nAnother way to classify Monte Carlo, from the physics point of view this times, is to look at\ntheir domain of applications. On the one hand stands a few general purpose MC that possess a wide\nrange of inelastic scattering (2 \u2192 2 or 2 \u2192 3) implemented for both SM and some BSM processes.\nThey also provide the radiation of photons from leptons and photons/gluons from quarks (called\nin that context QCD \"parton shower\"), the hadronisation of jets, decays of unstable particles and\nthe underlying event. The most frequently used general purpose MC are Pythia [117, 118, 119],\nHerwig++ [120, 121] and Sherpa [122, 123]. The other category are MC focused on specific processes\nbut that embrace more corrections at the level of the hard process (2 \u2192 n) compared to the general\npurpose MC. To obtain eventually physical events just like the one we observe in experiments they are\ninterfaced to general purpose MC. These tools are quite numerous and span large domains of physics,\nthis can go from standard processes with higher QCD/EW corrections to the supply of corrections to\nexisting MC events such as higher QED radiation in the final state like PHOTOS [124, 125, 126] or\nmanagement of \u03c4 or Higgs decays done respectively by TAUOLA [127, 128, 129] and HDECAY [130].\nThe refinements brought to the art of MC integration and event generation in High Energy Physics\ngoes far beyond the short overview made here. Among them is the variance reduction to improve\nconvergence speed, the handling of singularities in the integrand, and the delicate issue to generate\nevents at NLO in QCD. All those points and many others are addressed in dedicated documents.\nThere is, so far, no classic textbooks on the use of MC techniques in high energy physics.\nNonetheless, the reader eager to learn more on the subject is invited to look at the thesis of\nMichael Seymour [131] where one chapter provides a short yet thorough description of the matter. Other relevant sources are the presentations given by Monte Carlo experts in conferences (see\ne.g. [132, 133, 134, 135, 136]).\n\n\f70\n\nThe Monte Carlo event generator WINHAC\n\n(c)\n\nWeakness of Monte Carlo methods.\n\nSo far Monte Carlo methods have been promoted as the best tools one can work with in experimental\nhigh energy physics. Nonetheless, to be completely objective some light is cast on a few of their\nweaknesses.\nThe use of Monte Carlo simulation are safe when it comes to pragmatic application. To illustrate\nthis let us consider the example of nuclear safety where the control of the behaviour of a nuclear\nfacility relies on Monte Carlo simulations. In no case the underlying model implemented have to\nbe perfect, as long as it sticks to physical measurements. Then, using phenomenological models\naltogether with empirical laws are correct as long as the intended goal \u2013the control of the facility\u2013 is\nassured.\nIn high energy physics the aim is different. MC generators are introduced to simulate known\nprocesses but as well to help unravel possible deviations in paradigm models or even discover brand\nnew processes. Now the actual models are far from being perfect, large parts describing inelastic\nscatterings are modeled by non perturbative QCD, which relies on complex \u2013and sometime empirical\u2013\nparametrisation (e.g. hadronisation). This poses a problem for the relevancy of an experimental\nanalysis.\nThe awareness of these imperfection's acted as an incentive in the present work to come up with\nanalysis strategies which had to adapt to a given measurement to get as much as independent from\nMC imperfections. Also, in a first step, rather than using several Monte Carlo the choice for a deeper\nunderstanding of the used tool, WINHAC was adopted this being justified by the latter strategy to\nmake an analysis.\nTo conclude with this parenthesis, some quotations on this particular topic. The first one is\nextracted from a talk by J.D. Bjorken [137] as noted by Torbj\u00f6rn Sj\u00f6strand in [115]\n\"The Monte Carlo simulation has become the major means of visualization of not only\ndetector performance but also of physics phenomena. So far so good. But it often happens\nthat the physics simulations provided by the Monte Carlo generators carry the authority\nof data itself. They look like data and feel like data, and if one is not careful they are\naccepted as if they were data.\"\nThe second one is from the authors of Pythia who warn the users about the traps one can fall into\nYou must be very careful when you formulate the questions : any ambiguities will corrupt\nthe reply you get. And you must be even more careful not to misinterpret the answers ; in\nparticular not to pick the interpretation that suits you before considering the alternatives.\nFinally [. . . ] the current authors might unwittingly let a bug free in the program Pythia.\nIn conclusion a warning from the authors of Ref. [138]\nMonte Carlo event generators are complicated programs that will almost inevitably contain bugs, incorrect assumptions and ill-chosen parameters. It is therefore vital that a\nuser does not take any results at face value. As a minimum at least two completely\nindependent programs should be used in any physics studies.\n\n3.1.2\n\nThe Monte Carlo event generator WINHAC\n\nThe main tool that used in the present study is the Monte Carlo event generator WINHAC [139,\n140, 141, 142]. It has been developed in FORTRAN 77 (F77) by Wieslaw Placzek and Stanislaw\nJadach from the Cracow theoretical group which holds a leading role in term of electroweak radiative\ncorrections in Monte Carlo.\nWINHAC is dedicated to precision description of the charged-current Drell\u2013Yan process. It has\nbeen thoroughly tested and cross-checked with independent calculations [139, 140, 143, 142]. This\nMC program has already been used in previous studies of experimental prospects for exploring the\n\n\f3.1 The Monte Carlo event generator WINHAC\n\n71\n\nelectroweak symmetry breaking mechanism [144], in our ongoing effort for precision measurement of\nthe Standard Model parameters at the LHC within the ATLAS experiment [145, 146, 72, 74].\nAt the time of the redaction of this dissertation, the most recent version of WINHAC is release\n1.30 [147]. It features the exclusive Yennie\u2013Frautschi\u2013Suura exponentiation [148] of QED effects, i.e.\nthe radiation of n photons in the final state\n(\u2212)\n\nq + q\u0304 0 \u2192 W \u00b1 \u2192 l\u00b1 + \u03bdl + \u03b31 + \u03b32 + * * * + \u03b3n ,\n\n(3.5)\n\nwith n = {0, 1, . . . }, also referred to as multi-photon radiation. It also includes O(\u03b1) electroweak\ncorrections for the full charged-current Drell\u2013Yan process at the parton level, for more details see\nRef. [142]. This parton-level process is convoluted with the parton distribution functions (PDFs)\nprovided by the LHAPDF package [149] which includes a large set of recent PDF parametrisation\nby several groups. WINHAC is also interfaced with the Pythia 6.4 [117] MC event generator for the\nQCD/QED initial-state parton shower as well as for the hadronisation. Technical detail, Pythia and\nWINHAC are accessing to LHAPDF density functions through the LHAGLUE interface \u2013present in\nLHAPDF\u2013 which mimics the procedure that was used formerly to use PDFLIB [150] the ancestor of\nLHAPDF. Several type of collisions are made available : proton\u2013proton, proton\u2013anti-proton, proton\u2013\nion, ion\u2013ion, where each ion beam is defined by its charge number Z, atomic number A and energy in\nthe center of mass. For Z > 2, the nuclear shadowing effects from Refs. [151, 152] can be optionally\nswitched on.\nThe parton-level matrix elements are calculated numerically from spin amplitudes [139]. This\nallows for studies of any spin effects in the charged-current Drell\u2013Yan process. In fact, WINHAC\nprovides options for generation of processes with pure transversely or pure longitudinally polarised\nW bosons at the Born level.\nIn addition to the charged-current Drell\u2013Yan process, WINHAC includes the neutral-current Drell\u2013\nYan process (with \u03b3 \u2217 + Z bosons in the intermediate state), however at the Born level only. For\nprecision description of this latter process, similar to the former one, a dedicated MC event generator\ncalled ZINHAC [153] is being developed in C++ by Wieslaw Placzek and Andrzej Si\u00f3dmok. In the\nfuture, these twin MC generators can be used for precision studies/analyses of the Drell\u2013Yan processes\nincluding the QED/EW corrections.\nThe generation of random numbers in WINHAC is achieved using different classic algorithms. The\none used for our work is RANMAR [154, 155] which displays a periodicity of 2144 .\nFor this study version 1.23 of WINHAC has been used which for all aspects investigated and\nadopted strategies is equivalent to the latest version. They differ in description of QED/EW corrections but these have not been included in the present work. In Appendix 3.A an example of a\nWINHAC summary event is given.\nAs conclusion, in Table 3.1 we stress the place of WINHAC with respect to multi-purpose and a\nfew specialised Monte Carlo that can produce W or Z in Drell\u2013Yan. In this table MC event generator\n(Event Gen.) are distinguished from the one using only MC as a mean of integration (Histograms).\nAs it can be seen there is up to this date (2009) no Monte Carlo which hold QCD and EW corrections\nat the same level of detail.\nHence so far, Monte Carlo are usually combined to simulate with the closest possible accuracy\nthe physics observables needed to be confronted to the data. For example the extraction of MW for\nthe CDF II run [51] is made using the following Monte Carlo\n- pT,W is simulated with ResBos [166] and making cross checks with DYRAD [173] W +jet simulation.\n- The photon radiation corrections in the final state are made by WGRAD [63] and correct the\npT,l , mT, l \u03bdl and p/T,\u03bdl distributions from ResBos.\n- The background to W \u2192 e \u03bde (W \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd\u03c4 and Z/\u03b3 \u2217 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 ) and to W \u2192 \u03bc \u03bd\u03bc (W \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd\u03c4\nand Z/\u03b3 \u2217 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 ) are simulated using Pythia v 6.129 and passed to a GEANT-based full\nsimulation of the detector.\n\n\f72\n\nThe Monte Carlo event generator WINHAC\n\nMonte Carlo\n\nRefs.\n\nProcess\n\nQCD\n\nEW\n\nType\n\nWINHAC\n\n[139, 147]\n\nW\n\nPDF(x), impr.

Their implementation\nneeds to follow codified rules, just like any other tools in the experiment software, for clarity's sake. On\nthe one hand most event generators obey to custom rules and conventions and can be implemented in\nany programming language like F77, C/C++, etc. On the other, for convenience reasons, experiments\nsoftware environment relies on automated skeletons that treat all the present generators with the same\nmanner. For instance, Monte Carlo events needs, among many other things, to be smeared to simulate\nthe particle interactions with the material of the detector. This simulation takes as input a standard\ndata format which is completely blind to the generator that produced it. This example gives an idea\nof how a generator needs to fulfill a few requirements imposed by the experiment.\nThis section is divided as follow. After an overview of the main features of Athena [174], the\nsoftware environment of ATLAS, follows a description of the context in which WINHAC was introduced, that is in the simulation and reconstruction chain of the Monte Carlo events inside ATLAS.\nThe section ends on the implementation of WINHAC and the validation of this work.\n\n3.2.2\n\nSoftware environment of the ATLAS experiment\n\nTo better visualise the context of our discussion a brief overview of the software environment ATLAS\nrelies on is given.\nFirst of all, let us note the quantity of events selected by ATLAS together with the data outgoing\ntheir analysis should represents each year a volume of information of the order of 10 Peta-byte1 .\nHence to overcome this challenge ATLAS had to aim for a highly decentralised storage and data\n1\n\n1 Peta \u2261 1015 .\n\n\f3.2 Implementation of WINHAC in the ATLAS software\n\n73\n\nmanagement. This system obeys to a certain hierarchy where tasks are split into facilities called\nTiers which principal activities are recaptured below.\nAlthough it will not be emphasised later on let us note that one of the philosophy in the use of\nTiers prescribes, for obvious safety reasons, to make a least one back up of each data batch. The\nfirst data processing occurs at CERN in the unique Tier-0 facility where raw data are saved and\nreconstructed into ESD, AOD and TAG formats which description are gathered at the end of \u00a7 3.2.3.\nThis first data batch are shared among Tiers-1, of the order of ten all other the world. The tenth of\nthese raw data are stored to give new ESD, AOD and TAG. Tiers-1 need to provide good accessibility\nfor the data they store as well as the necessary capacity to analyse them. Tiers-2 provide work related\nto the calibration, the simulation and the analysis. Finally Tiers-3 are made of local sources in each\ninstitute necessary to store custom data (e.g. ntuple) and act as well as access points to upstream\nTiers. More details on the precise role of each Tier are given in Ref. [174]. This decentralisation of\ndata processing and storage is provided by the Grid which allows to make out of the ATLAS software\na virtual facility split between several calculators spread throughout the world.\nThe informatics environment of ATLAS is called Athena [174, 175]. Athena is an evolved version\nof the Gaudi [176, 177] framework developed initially by the LHCb [87] experiment and is now common\nto both ATLAS and LHCb projects. Amid the important features of Athena is the clear separation\nbetween the data and the algorithms as well as between transient data (in memory) and persistent (in\nfile) data. The processing of the data for data selection, event simulation, reconstruction and analysis\nis governed by Athena. Athena is object oriented (OO). Its structure is build mainly in C++, uses\nextensively the ROOT System[178, 179] with some tools written in FORTRAN 77 or Java while the\nuser interacts with Athena via Python.\n\n3.2.3\n\nSimulation and reconstruction of Monte Carlo events within ATLAS\n\nHere we give a description of the different steps that allow, starting from Monte Carlo events or from\nreal data, to reach reconstructed data. The first overview and the details that follow can be grasped\nlooking at Fig. 3.1. Let us remind more details on the data type mentioned are compiled at the end\nof this section.\n(a)\n\nOverview of the simulation and of the reconstruction\n\nStarting with the real data. The event filter \u2013the last process of the ATLAS trigger\u2013 provides as\noutputs raw data in byte stream format, i.e. sequence of 1/0. These information are then converted\nto objects, the Raw Data Object (RDO) transmitted in turn to reconstruction algorithms. Before\ndescribing the reconstruction chain, let us come back to the stages the simulated data must follow. In\nthe first step physical events are produced by Monte Carlo event generators, at this stage acceptance\ncuts can be applied on some observables such as pT , \u03b7, E\n/ T , etc. These events, as seen previously in\n\u00a7 1.3, are labelled \"truth events\" or \"generator level\" data. They are transmitted to algorithms that\nsimulate their passage in the ATLAS detector. This step is by far the most CPU time consuming.\nThe output are hits, that can be merged with pile-up events, the latter receiving a special treatment.\nAfter comes the digitisation which goal is to emulate the electronic read-out chain of the several\nsub-detectors of ATLAS. This gives eventually simulated RDO. The simulation step finished the\nreconstruction chain is over-viewed.\nEven though RDO are oriented object they are nonetheless raw data. Also the goal of the reconstruction, as its name indicates, consists to reconstruct objects containing only relevant information\nfor a physic analysis.\nFinally let us mention the fast simulation of the detector. Since the simulation part is very time\nconsuming most experiments have tools with an approximated but faster simulation of the detector.\nIn ATLAS, this fast simulation is called Atlfast [180, 181, 182]. It shortcuts all simulation chain steps,\nthat is from the particles four-momentum outgoing the generator it directly gives reconstructed data.\n\n\f74\n\nThe Monte Carlo event generator WINHAC\n\nSimulated data\nMC generator\n+\nFilters\nReal Data\nHepMC\n\nATLAS\nSimulation\n\nTrigger\n\nHits\n\nPile-up\n\nDigitalisation\n\nMerged\nhits\n\nRDO\n\nRaw\ndata\n\nConverter\n(bits \u2192 objet)\nRDO\n\nFast Simulation\n(Atlfast)\n\nReconstruction\nPhysical data (OO)\n(ESD, AOD, TAG, etc.)\n\nFigure 3.1: Schematic representation of the simulation (Monte Carlo data) and reconstruction of both Monte Carlo\nand real data. The add-up of the pile-up (box with dashed borders) is an optional step.\n\nIn the rest complementary information on the simulation and reconstruction chains are given. For\neach step the emphasis is made first on physics aspects and then on technical aspects. For further\ndetails on all technical aspects related to the Athena framework the reader is sent back to the ATLAS\nComputing TDR [174] and to the on-line workbook [175].\n(b)\n\nThe simulation chain\n\nGeneration. The physics motivation being already known we move on directly to technical aspects\nwith more emphasis with respect to other steps since the work for implementing WINHAC occurred\nat this stage.\nInserting a MC within ATLAS consists to write inside Athena a C++ interface calling the algorithms of the generator within its original libraries. Those instances are roughly :\n- The initialisation, which essentially switches on the MC generator algorithms, read the input\nparameters, etc.\n- The event loop in which the MC generate events.\n\n\f3.2 Implementation of WINHAC in the ATLAS software\n\n75\n\n- The finalisation where algorithms are shut down and the data are saved.\nThese three steps are realised for all the generators within Athena via the inheritance of the methods\nof the class GenzModule.\nConcerning the libraries of the stand-alone code they are stored outside of the Athena framework in\nAFS or in the GENSER (GENerator SERvice) repository. The goal would be eventually to maintain\nall generators libraries by the GENSER LCG project [183] which would provide validated libraries\nfor the needs of both theoreticians and experiments associated to the LHC.\nThe random numbers in Athena are provided by the use of the Athena Random Generator Service\nwhich uses RanecuEngine [154] maintained by CLHEP [184].\nThe parton distributions functions are provided by the LHAPDF package [149].\nThe output for the events is in the HepMC [185] format that records information related to each\nevent. The HepMC format possess an infinite number of entries, the storage of the matrix density\nin each vertexes, the flow pattern (e.g. color) and their follow up, the record of the used random\nnumbers along with an arbitrary number of statistical weight that can be associated to each event.\nThis tool developed in C++ by ATLAS members has become the standard for the record of high\nenergy event and is now maintained by CLHEP.\nSimulation. The goal of the simulation stage is to simulate the passage of particles generated by\nthe MC within the sub-detectors of ATLAS, i.e. energy deposit in the calorimetry and tracks left in\nboth inner tracker and muon spectrometer.\nThis task is made by GEANT 4 [186, 187]. GEANT model the geometry and composition of the\nATLAS detector, and simulate the physical process occurring as particles pass through each cells.\nHits record information related to the position, yielded energies, identifications of activated elements,\netc. For the pile-up Athena provides a stock of simulated pile-up and select for each event one random\nset and optionally merges it to the process simulated upstream.\nDigitisation. Hits need to be converted into an output of the same format with the one provided\nby the ATLAS detector for real data. For that purpose matters such as the propagation of charges\n(e.g. in the tracker or in the LAr) and of light (e.g. in the tiles of the hadronic calorimeter) as well\nas the response of the read out electronic needs to be emulated.\nContrary to the previous steps these tasks are very specific to the detector and cannot be accomplished without the physicist directly involved with the assembly and testing of each ATLAS\nspecific sub-detectors. This step provides output in RDO format. Let us note all Monte Carlo truth\ninformation, kept so far for cross check, are removed from simulated RDO so that they exactly look\nlike the format of the real data selected by the ATLAS trigger.\n(c)\n\nReconstruction of physic events\n\nThe goal of the reconstruction is to devise from raw data the vital information necessary to perform\nan analysis. To be more specific information related to photons, electrons, muons, taus, K 0 , jets,\nE\n/ T , primary vertexes, etc. These collected data from each sub-detector are combined to optimally\nreconstruct four-momenta for the widest range of momentum, pseudo-rapidity and whatever value of\nthe luminosity, all of that with the less background for particle identification.\nThe reconstruction is split in several steps depicted in Fig. 3.2. In a first stage is the individual\nreconstruction of the data outgoing the sub-detectors (tracking and calorimetry) then comes the\ncombined reconstruction which corresponds to the beginning of particle identification. An example of\nthis step has been given for the case of the inner detector tracks reconstruction in Chapter 2 \u00a7 2.3.2.\nThe output of this procedure are in ESD format.\nIn the second stage the preparation to the analysis starts with more complex reconstructed objects\n(e.g. b-tagging) and with a reduction of the data to the AOD format.\nFinally data are tagged with the use of TAG files created from the AOD.\n\n\f76\n\nThe Monte Carlo event generator WINHAC\n\nRDO\n\nReconstruction\n\nESD\n\nAnalysis\npreparation\n\nAOD\n\nTagging\n\nTAG\n\nFigure 3.2: Schematic representation of the steps of the data reconstruction. Boxes with sharp edges represent\nalgorithms while the rounded boxes represents data.\n\n(d)\n\nSum up of the different data format\n\nAs seen previously different data format exist at different stages of the simulation and reconstruction\nchain. The list below makes a summary of the one mentioned earlier.\nRaw data. These are the data provided by the event filter, the last stage of the ATLAS trigger,\nand are written in byte stream format. Each file contains the information related to a run and each\nevent, delivered at a frequency of 200 Hz, should weight 1.6 Mb. This data format, contrary to the\none that follow, is not object oriented.\nRaw Data Object (RDO). The RDO is essentially an oriented object (C++) representation of\nthe byte stream information from the raw data.\nHepMC. Format holding generator level information coming from MC generators, that is a purely\ntheoretical information.\nHits. Format carrying recording real interactions of simulated particles with the detector. Hits\ncarry information like position, energy deposit, identifier of the active element, etc. after simulating\nthe theoretical events in the ATLAS detector.\nEvent Summary Data (ESD). These files contain reconstructed information necessary to deduce\nthe identification of particles, the track refitting, the jet calibration, etc. The goal of this format is to\navoid to access to raw data for every study out of the calibration context or of the re-reconstruction.\nThose files are written in POOL ROOT format [178, 179] with an average size of 500 Kb per event.\nAnalysis Object Data (AOD). These POOL ROOT files are derived from ESD. They contain\nphysical objects with information relevant to an analysis. It is on this format that in the long run\nmost physical studies should be based upon. Each even takes a size on disk of the order of 100 Kb.\nTAG. These files are created in the goal to identify and select produced data. They contain\ninformation on the data batches, each event occupy a size of 100 Kb.\nFor conclusion several tests that were carried in this work to validate the implementation of the\nWINHAC interface are based on the CBNT (ComBined NTuple) format which hold data in Trees and\nleaves ROOT format.\n\n3.2.4\n(a)\n\nImplementation of WINHAC inside Athena\nThe Winhac i interface\n\nIn this part we present Winhac i, the interface between WINHAC and Athena. This work has been\nmade in collaboration with Giorgos Stavropoulos to make of WINHAC an ATLAS approved Monte\nCarlo event generator used for the production of event samples as reported in Ref. [71].\n\n\f3.2 Implementation of WINHAC in the ATLAS software\n\n77\n\nThe requirements from the Athena framework imposed to switch to its own random generator\nand to the use of the LHAPDF libraries since in the version of WINHAC used at that time (v 1.21)\nPDFLIB was still use. The feedback to the authors allowed the code to evolve in later releases\nto use of LHAPDF as the default option (v 1.22 and upper). Finally always at the time of this\nimplementation the LHAPDF package did not provided nuclear corrections necessary when studying\nion-ion collisions. Again to fulfill our needs the maintainer of the LHAPDF code included nuclear\ncorrections (LHAPDF v5r2 and above) in the same way they were called so far via the LHAGLUE\ninterface.\nWINHAC is an event generator dedicated to a particular process. Nonetheless it was not implemented like many others MC using the \"Les Houches\" format [188] whose procedure consists\nto provide to a general purpose Monte Carlo a hard process to dress-up its kinematics with the\nQED/parton showers, hadronisation, decays, etc. As specified before, WINHAC uses Pythia parton\nshower and hadronisation scheme for its purpose and this specificity was kept in the interface. This\nis justified for example by the fact that the parton shower in the initial state should eventually be\nreplaced by one made by the authors. To stick with the ATLAS standards an additional interface\nwas written to overwrite the hard-coded Pythia options in WINHAC by the default values imposed\nin Athena.\n(b)\n\nValidation of the implementation\n\nThis section describes essential results obtained to validate Winhac i. In what follows all Monte\nCarlo which are referred to are used within the Athena framework. First, tuned comparisons at the\ngenerator level were achieved with well validated MC. The goal of these tests were to improve the\ninterfacing of WINHAC from both technical and physical point of view. Complements on this work\nare available through the reports brought to the CERN forum [189, 190].\nTuned comparisons at the generator level. Tuned comparisons were achieved, i.e. using the\nsame input parameters in the Monte Carlo, successively to confront WINHAC to Pythia and then\nto Pythia+PHOTOS for W \u2192 \u03bc \u03bd\u03bc with a statistic of 100, 000 events. Pythia parameters were\ntuned with the one used to the WINHAC default this being justified since at that time overwriting the\nhard-coded Pythia parameters used in WINHAC by the Athena defaults had not yet been though\nthrough.\nThe first test, versus Pythia, is set up at the Born level with, for only higher corrections, the\nQCD and QED parton shower in the initial state. This imply that both data due to the structure of\nWINHAC are perfectly similar from both physical/technical point of view, indeed in both cases the\nparton shower was done by Pythia 6.403.\nIn Fig. 3.3 are respectively represented the rapidity and transverse momentum of the W and\nthe pseudo-rapidity and transverse momentum of the charged leptons. The validation using pT,W\nis important as its distribution turns out to be very sensible from the parton shower and from the\nintrinsic kT of partons (cf. Chapter 1 and Fig. 1.13.(b)). In Pythia this meant to take for these runs\na Gaussian distribution for kT which corresponds to use the value MSTP(91)=1 with hkT i = 1 GeV\nthat latter corresponding to the switch PARP(91)=1. Another point, no multiple interactions were\nused (MSTP(81)=0). For further details on the physical and technical aspects of these parameters see\nRef. [117]. As expected the data from both generator agree within the statistical limit.\nFor the second test WINHAC was used by adding up to the previous setting QED multi-photon\nradiation. On the other side to emulate higher QED radiation in Pythia the former set up was\nplugged to the PHOTOS [124, 125, 126] generator which added QED corrections in the final state of\nthe events. In both cases, WINHAC and Pythia+PHOTOS, a common value was used to cut on the\nenergies of soft photons at the level of the analysis, that is E\u03b3 > 500 MeV. In Fig. 3.4, the number of\nradiated photons are represented with the total energy of these photons. Below are represented the\ntransverse momenta of the hardest and second hardest photons defined respectively as, for a given\n\n\f78\n\nThe Monte Carlo event generator WINHAC\n\nP YTHIA\nWINHAC\n\nNumber of events\n\n1.20\n\n(b)\n\n2000\n\n1000\n\n0\n\n1.00\n0.80\n\u22126\n\n\u22124\n\n\u22122\n\n0\n\nyW\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\nP YTHIA /WINHAC\n\nNumber of events\n\n3000\n\nP YTHIA /WINHAC\n\n(a)\n\nP YTHIA\nWINHAC\n\n103\n\n102\n1.20\n1.00\n0.80\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n(c)\nNumber of events\n\n2000\n1000\n\nP YTHIA /WINHAC\n\n0\n1.20\n1.00\n0.80\n\u22124\n\n\u22122\n\n0\n\n\u03b7\u03bc\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\nP YTHIA /WINHAC\n\nNumber of events\n\n3000\n\n\u22126\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n(d)\n\nP YTHIA\nWINHAC\n\n4000\n\n40\n\npT,W [GeV]\n\nP YTHIA\nWINHAC\n\n103\n\n102\n1.20\n1.00\n0.80\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\npT,\u03bc [GeV]\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\nFigure 3.3: Tuned comparison between Pythia and WINHAC within the Athena software, displaying yW (a), pT,W (b),\n\u03b7l (c) and pT,l (d) distributions. The lower frames in each plot displays refined comparison in the ratio Pythia/WINHAC.\n\nevent, the photon with the highest pT and the second highest pT . Although the statistic is quite small\nfor the histograms related to photons one can see there is a good agreement within the statistical\nerror.\nSome discrepancies were observed though while looking at the transverse mass. In Fig. 3.5 the\nmT,\u03bc\u03bd\u03bc distribution is represented for both the first validation set up and the present one. One can\nsee in the latter case from the ratio frame that after the jacobian peak WINHAC displays a slight shift\nto higher pT with respect to Pythia(+PHOTOS). These discrepancies can be amended by the fact\nthat here WINHAC and PHOTOS do not treat QED radiation on the same footing. Indeed, PHOTOS\ndo not take into account cases where the one or several photon are emitted by the W boson as well\nas the interference this creates with other diagrams where the charged lepton radiates photon(s).\nSimulation and reconstruction tests. The last test consisted to pass WINHAC events through\nthe whole simulation and reconstruction chain. Tests were passed with success respectively for\nW \u2192 e \u03bde , \u03bc \u03bd\u03bc , l \u03bdl each time with a statistic of 1, 000 events using acceptance cuts of pT,l > 20 GeV\nand |\u03b7l | < 2.5. The low statistic is justified because of the long time it takes to simulate events. In\neach case the data was obtained in ESD, AOD and CBNT format.\nFig. 3.6 presents respectively comparisons between the generator and reconstructed data for the\ntransverse momentum and pseudo-rapidity of the muon. The reconstruction was made using the\nMOORE algorithm [191] that reconstructs tracks in the muon spectrometer.\n\n\f3.2 Implementation of WINHAC in the ATLAS software\n\n(a)\n\n100\n\n10\n\n(b)\nP YTHIA + PHOTOS (PP)\nWINHAC (WH)\n\n10\n\nNumber of events\n\nNumber of events\n(PP \u2212 WH)/(PP + WH)\n\n105\n104\n3\n\n102\n101\n\nP YTHIA + PHOTOS (PP)\nWINHAC (WH)\n\n5\n\n104\n103\n102\n101\n100\n3.0\n\nPP/WH\n\n0.10\n0.00\n\n\u22120.10\n\n2.0\n1.0\n0.0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nNumber of radiated photons\n\n4\n\n5\n\n0\n\n100\n\n(c) \u2212 Hardest photon\n\nNumber of events\n\nNumber of events\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\nE\u03b3 [GeV]\n\n700\n\n800\n\n900\n\n1000\n\nP YTHIA + PHOTOS (PP)\nWINHAC (WH)\n\n3\n\n102\n101\n\n102\n\n101\n\n100\n6\nPP/WH\n\n100\n3.0\nPP/WH\n\n200\n\n(d) \u2212 Second hardest photon\n\nP YTHIA + PHOTOS (PP)\nWINHAC (WH)\n\n10\n\n79\n\n2.0\n1.0\n0.0\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\npT,\u03b31 [GeV]\n\n4\n2\n0\n0\n\n50\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\npT,\u03b32 [GeV]\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\nFigure 3.4: Tuned comparison between Pythia+PHOTOS and WINHAC showing the number of radiated photons\n(a), the total energy of the radiated photons (b), the transverse momentum of the first hardest photons (c) and second\nhardest photons (d).\n\n(b)\nNumber of events\n\n103\n\n102\n\n1.40\n1.20\n1.00\n0.80\n0.60\n0\n\nP YTHIA + PHOTOS (PP)\nWINHAC (WH)\n103\n\n102\n\n1.40\nPP/WH\n\nP YTHIA /WINHAC\n\nNumber of events\n\n(a)\nP YTHIA\nWINHAC\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\nmT,\u03bc\u03bd\u03bc [GeV]\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\n1.20\n1.00\n0.80\n0.60\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\nmT,\u03bc\u03bd\u03bc [GeV]\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\nFigure 3.5: Tuned comparison based on the leptons transverse mass for Pythia versus WINHAC at the Born level (a)\nand Pythia+PHOTOS versus WINHAC at the Born+multi-photon QED radiation (b).\n\n\f80\n\nThe Monte Carlo event generator WINHAC\nN\u03b3\n\nPythia+PHOTOS\n\nWINHAC\n\n0\n1\n2\n3\n\n88374\n10927\n677\n21\n\n88440\n10874\n664\n22\n\nTable 3.2: Number of radiated photons N\u03b3 from WINHAC and Pythia+PHOTOS simulations.\n\n70\n\n(a) \u2212 Reconstructed transverse momentum of the muon\n\n(b) \u2212 Reconstructed pseudorapidity of the muon\n\nGenerator level\nReconstructed level (MOORE)\n\n35\n\n60\n\n30\nNumber of events\n\nNumber of events\n\n50\n40\n30\n20\n\n25\n20\n15\n10\n\n10\n0\n0\n\nGenerator level\nReconstructed level (MOORE)\n\n5\n10\n\n20\n\n30\npT,\u03bc [GeV]\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n0\u22124\n\n\u22123\n\n\u22122\n\n\u22121\n\n0\n\u03b7\u03bc\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nFigure 3.6: WINHAC muon kinematics at the generator and reconstructed level for the transverse momentum (a) and\nthe pseudo-rapidity (b).

In this approach,\nthe simulation of the detector for the analysis is achieved using Gaussian resolution to emulate the\ninner detector resolution. The reason for that is that the statistic that needed to be generated is too\nhuge to be passed through the whole simulation and reconstruction chain of the ATLAS detector.\nActually, analysis with real data are based on the same principle where instead of taking the whole\nsimulation for the detector a tuned fast simulation is used for all Monte Carlo simulation. This is for\nexample the strategy used by CDF II for the measurement of MW [51].\nThe last argument becomes more tangible when looking quantitatively at the present analysis\nrequirements. Studies were made for an integrated luminosity of 10 fb\u22121 which means an order of\n\u223c 1.1 \u00d7 108 W + and \u223c 0.8 \u00d7 108 W \u2212 . In order to optimise the strategy to measure their masses,\ngeneration and simulation of O(100) event samples was required. These samples correspond to specific\nbiases in the detector response, or in the theoretical (phenomenological) modeling of the W -boson\nproduction processes. In addition, a large number of unbiased event samples, for variable values\nof the masses of the W + and W \u2212 bosons, was simulated. For an assessment of the impact of the\nsystematic biases on the overall measurement precision each of the above event sample must contains\nat least 108 events in order to match the systematic and the statistical measurement precision.\nThe presented analysis is then based on a total sample of O(1010 ) W boson events. Generating,\nsimulating and handling such a large event sample within reasonable limits of the storage space and\ncomputing power is challenging. Indeed, if we consider in the simplest case scenario where the gist\nof the event2 would be recorded in double precision, this should require \u2248 500 bytes for each event\n2\n\nThat is the four-momenta, types and genealogy of each particle entering in the hard process (\u223c 10 particles per\n\n\f3.3 Framework of the analysis\n\n81\n\nsummaries, which leads eventually to store a Terabyte of data on disk. Besides, even though one can\ncompute an accurate experimental simulation using GEANT, the treatment of hundreds of millions\nof events would be prohibitive. The computing of the desired histograms on a dedicated farm, using\na fast simulation, takes 1\u20132 days to get all the necessary event samples.\nA short descriptions of both generation and analysis framework are given below.\n\n3.3.1\n\nGeneration framework\n\nIn that state of mind, the generation is made using the WINHAC event generator in stand-alone\nmode. An overview of the main features of the generation framework is represented in Fig. 3.7. For\nconvenience the generation framework interfaced to WINHAC was also written in FORTRAN 77. This\nframework takes as input the physics parameters necessary for the initialisation and the running of\nWINHAC. During this initialisation the observables of interest are booked. Then in the generation\nloop, for each event, standard calling instances to WINHAC implemented by its authors allow to access\nbasics quantities such as four-momentum, particles type, etc. from which observables of interest can\nbe calculated. For practical reasons all analysis were made using weighted events since it is faster.\nAt this stage, cuts or smearing to emulate the ATLAS detector resolution can be optionally applied.\nEventually each observable fills the corresponding histogram and at the end of the generation the\nhistograms are written in ASCII files along with the cross section of the process. Already at this\nstage histograms are normalised to nb according to the conventions stated in Chapter 1 \u00a7 1.3.\nOn our road to an experimental investigation a preliminary step consisted to look only at the\ngenerator level predictions with only optional phase-space cuts to put the spot on a particular behaviour. This is presented in the next Chapter. Then the more realistic experimental analysis for\nMW + \u2212 MW \u2212 was made using some acceptance cuts related to the ATLAS performances and the\nsmearing of the data was computed according to Eqs. (2.15\u20132.16) from \u00a7 2.3.2. This step us presented\nin Chapter 5.\nLet us note that in both cases, sometimes, changes of the original PDFs predictions needed to be\ndone. Still, for both security and practical reasons the LHAPDF package was not touched. Instead an\ninterface was written which lures WINHAC and Pythia to use custom values instead of the original\nones. The subroutines that needed to be substituted to the use of the original ones are of the number\nof three and belong to the LHAGLUE interface written to mimic the old-fashion way to call PDFs\nfrom the PDFLIB package. These three subroutines which Pythia and WINHAC depend on are\nbriefly described. The first one \u2013the most fundamental\u2013 is STRUCTM which gives for a given PDF set\nat fraction x and scale \u03bc2f the parton density functions in the output form x fi (x, \u03bc2f ), where i is such\nthat\n) (\u2212) (\u2212)\n \u0304 u, \u016b, (\u2212\ni = {g, d, d,\ns , c , b },\nwith, for reminder, q (s) = q\u0304 (s) , where (s) means sea for s, c and b flavors. The two other subroutines,\nused exclusively by WINHAC, are PFTOPDG and STRUCTA and both rely on the output from STRUCTM.\nPFTOPDG provides the flavors in a one dimensional array which indexes, ranging from -6 to 6, are associated to the conventional ID number given to partons (see Ref. [1], Monte Carlo particle numbering\nscheme section). STRUCTA adds to the predictions of STRUCTM nuclear shadowing effects in the aim to\ncompute the PDFs for a hadron of mass A.\nTo these subroutines are substituted our custom copies\n- EX STRUCTM\n- EX PFTOPDG\n- EX STRUCTA\nthe structure of the two last one are unchanged, they are just relying on EX STRUCTM instead of the\noriginal subroutine. Then, any changes in the density functions are made by playing with the output\nvalues of EX STRUCTM.\nevent).\n\n\f82\n\nThe Monte Carlo event generator WINHAC\n\nLegend\nTools used for the generation\nTools implemented for the generation\n\nWINHAC Monte Carlo\nPythia\n\nLHAPDF\n\nSUBROUTINE PYPDFU\n\nLHAGLUE interface\n\nSUBROUTINE PYPDEL\n\nEX STRUCTM\nEX STRUCTA\nEX PFTOPDG\n\nHadronisation Lund model\n\nWINHAC\n\nSTRUCTM\nSTRUCTA\nPFTOPDG\n\n\u2022 Hadronisation\n\nPDF sets data\nevolved at scale\n2\n\u03bc2f = MW\n\nCTEQ\nMRST\n...\n\n\u2022 Parton shower\n\n\u2022 \u03a3i,j fiA(x1) fjB (x2)\n\nGENERATION FRAMEWORK\nInput\nphysics\nparameters\nOutput\nhistograms\n(ASCII)\n\n1.

Slight details where given for only Pythia\nsince this Monte Carlo being extensively used its subroutines are more familiar in the high energy\nphysics community.\n\n3.3.2\n\nAnalysis framework\n\nHere we describe the methods that were used to perform all kind of histograms and/or analysis from\nthe WINHAC event generations present in this document and in our ongoing studies [72, 74]. This\nhistograms/analysis framework is represented schematically on Fig. 3.8.\nThe framework is made of a central set of functions written in C++ and gathered in one *.cxx\nfile and its associated header file *.h. This framework relies on C++ and STL (Standard Template\nLibraries) classes and also on ROOT classes [178, 179] from version 5.14. The ROOT classes and\nmethods that are used essentially to handle one-dimensional double precision histograms containers\nTH1D and other methods inherent to this class which allow the user to perform basic operations on and\nbetween histograms. ROOT is also called to display histograms and related analysis results using the\nclass TApp. Histograms are then displayed using the canvas class TCanvas, stored inside *.root files\n\n\f3.3 Framework of the analysis\n\n83\n\n(using the TFile class) and postscript files for later browsing. Each step of the histograms/analysis\nconsists always to the same principle which is to write a C++ program to reach a given goal with\nthe help of calls of functions from our framework.\nNow, further details are given on the treatment of data in a chronological order. In a first step,\nall the ASCII histograms obtained from the generation and sharing the same input parameters are\nconverted to TH1D objects and stored in *.root files whose names are based on the main physical\ninput parameters.\nLegend\nTools used for the analysis\nTools implemented for the analysis\nData\n\nC++\n\nSTL\n\nROOT\n\nAnalysis framework (*.h, *.cxx)\n\n*.dat\n\nASCII \u2192 ROOT histos\n\nTCanvas\nData,etc.\n\nPhysics Analysis\n\nTH1D\n\nFigure 3.8: Analysis framework schematic representation.\nIn a second intermediate step \u2013not represented in Fig. 3.8\u2013 the newly created histograms are read\nfrom the *.root files they are stored in and displayed as TCanvas for visual cross-check. Those canvas\nare saved in *.root and postscript files to allow visual control for safety.\nFinally the last step consists to produce the desired results that is fine histograms or an analysis.\nThe first procedure was used extensively to understand the asymmetries in the mechanisms of production between W + and W \u2212 . For that purpose in top of drawing the two (d \u03c3 + /d a) and (d \u03c3 \u2212 /d a)\ndistributions related to the observable a, another frame was drawn in the canvas to display discrepancies between them. Optionally the difference, the ratio, or the charge asymmetry (Eq. (1.7)) of\nthe two distributions was computed the latter being preferred due to the nature of the present work.\nThis kind of analysis are presented in the next Chapter.\nConcerning the physics analysis it involved to perform likelihood studies between a main (M) and\nN -templates event samples distributions which nth. template is labeled T(n) . This will be explained\nthoroughly in Chapter 5 here only the technical principle is described. It is very basic though, the\nmain/templates distributions are read out from their respective *.root files and using dedicated\nfunctions of the framework a likelihood analysis is performed between each couple {M, T(n) } couple.\nThe main histograms and all templates are displayed along with the likelihood results in canvas and\nsaved in *.root.\n\n\f84\n\nThe Monte Carlo event generator WINHAC\n\n\f3.A Example of a WINHAC summary event\n\n3.A\n\n85\n\nExample of a WINHAC summary event\nEt toi mon code pourquoi bogues tu\nComme un prompteur stroboscopique\nJe scanne les nigtlies et les logs\nLe prompteur stroboscopique\nGuillaume Apollinaire++\n\nThe two columns below represent a WINHAC event displayed using a Pythia routine.

\"Then you have already lost. For I have trained my entire\nlife to face the unknown.\"\nBlack Panther #39 - See Wakanda and Die (September 2008)\n\nThis Chapter presents the phenomenology of the W + and W \u2212 bosons production in Drell\u2013Yan\nprocesses at the LHC. This preliminary work is mandatory before addressing any kind of study related\nto the extraction of the W boson properties. Indeed, the LHC in top of supplying unprecedented\nluminosity and energy in collisions will provide \u2013due to the nature of the colliding beams\u2013 original kinematics with respect to the one inherent to p p\u0304 collisions studied exhaustively for these last\ndecades at the SPS and Tevatron colliders. These original LHC features demand to start with basics\nunderstanding before addressing a more complete analysis prospect.\nThe Chapter is divided as follow. In a short introduction the context of the studies is described\nfrom both physics and technical point of view. Then comes the phenomenological understanding of\nthe W + and W \u2212 bosons production in Drell\u2013Yan, first by looking at the production of W and then\nat the whole process by studying the properties of the decaying charged leptons.\nLet us stress that before reaching the refined understanding presented here more thorough analysis\nwere done using complementary distributions, different physical input parameters, for specific domains\nof the phase-space, etc. Nonetheless, to keep the discussion as clear as possible in the core of the\nChapter all these exhaustive studies are compiled in Appendix 4.A.\n\n4.1\n\nContext of these studies\n\nThe most relevant kinematics to the W in Drell\u2013Yan are reviewed at the generator level, that is\nlooking only at the purely phenomenological level.\nAmong all the observables/pseudo-observables that entered in our study only a few were kept in\nthe core of the Chapter. They are of two categories. First are the pseudo-observables characterising\nthe W boson properties, its rapidity yW and transverse momentum pT,W . Then are the observables\ncharacterising the charged lepton properties, its pseudo-rapidity \u03b7l and transverse momentum pT,l\nthat allows to study the whole process. The definitions of these quantities and the information they\nhold for W in Drell\u2013Yan have been over-viewed in Chapter 1 \u00a7 1.4.2.(d) for the case of a charge blind\nstudy. Here, based on this previous overview a fine study of the positive and negative channel is\nconsidered.\nThe type of collisions considered are : p p\u0304, p p and d d. The p p\u0304 collision scheme is considered\nas a reference since in that case the production of W + and W \u2212 are on the same footing and the\n\n\f88\n\nPhenomenology of W+ and W\u2212 in Drell\u2013Yan like processes at the LHC\nCollider\n\n+\n\u03c3(incl.)\n[nb]\n\n\u2212\n\u03c3(incl.)\n[nb]\n\n\u00b1\n\u03c3(incl.)\n[nb]\n\np p\u0304\npp\ndd\n\n17.4\n19.8\n32.5\n\n17.4\n14.7\n32.4\n\n34.4\n34.5\n64.9\n\n+\n\u2212\n\u00b1\nTable 4.1: Inclusive hadronic cross sections \u03c3(incl.)\n, \u03c3(incl.)\nand \u03c3(incl.)\nrespectively for the W + , W \u2212 and W in Drell\u2013\n\n\u221a\n\u221a\nYan with S = 14 TeV for p p\u0304 and p p collisions and S n1 n2 = 7 TeV in the n1 n2 nucleon\u2013nucleon center of mass\nenergy for d d collisions (computed by WINHAC).\n\ncharacteristics of the kinematics are well known from the experience gathered from SPS and Tevatron\ncolliders. Standard LHC p p collisions are analysed as well with isoscalar beams collisions on the\nexample of deuteron\u2013deuteron (d d) targets which is justified for both pedagogical means and because\nthe strategy prospect\nin the next Chapter relies on such a scheme. The nucleon\u2013nucleon center of\n\u221a\nmass energy S is of 14 TeV for p p\u0304 and p p collisions and of 7 TeV for d d collisions according to\nthe expected LHC capabilities (cf. Eqs. (2.11\u20132.12)). The choice of 14 TeV in the center of mass\nenergy for p p\u0304 is justified by the wish to put the energy scales and accessible phase space to the\nparticles on the same footing as the one for p p collisions to stress the differences between these two\ncollision schemes. The total hadronic cross sections corresponding to these collisions and computed\nby WINHAC are gathered in Table 4.1.\nNow details are given on the material presented below from a more technical point of view. All the\nhistograms were produced using the WINHAC Monte Carlo event generator at the truth level within\nimproved leading order defined from the physics point of view in Chapter 1 \u00a7 1.4.2.(d) and from a\nMonte Carlo point of view in Chapter 3 \u00a7 3.1.2. A common statistic of 200 millions weighted events\nwere used for each W + and W \u2212 channel and for all type of collisions. The decay of the W bosons was\nopened to both electronic and muonic channels. Every histograms were generated with 200 bins and\nfor visual convenience this former binning was reduced later on at the analysis level when necessarily.\nThe remaining input parameters of importance for the generation are :\n- MW = 80.403 GeV, \u0393W = 2.141 GeV with the fixed-width scheme in the W boson propagator.\n- The partons intrinsic kT are modeled by the Pythia Gaussian scheme (cf. Ref. [117]) with\nhkT i = 4 GeV.\n- PDF set : CTEQ6.1M [66].\n\nLet us remind the conventions used for the coordinate systems and the definitions of the common\nkinematics are gathered in Chapter 1 \u00a7 1.3. In this context, p p\u0304 collisions are defined in the Cartesian\nbasis, with the proton moving in the +z direction while the anti-proton moves in the \u2212z direction. In\nwhat follows the discrepancies between the positive and negative channels predictions are scrutinised\nusing the charge asymmetry (Eq. (1.7)).\n\n4.2\n\nProduction of W+ and W\u2212 bosons\n\nIn this Section the W boson production mechanism is discussed via the analysis of the W boson\nrapidity yW and transverse momentum pT,W . Figure 4.1 presents the latter distributions for W + and\nW \u2212 bosons, as well as their associated charge asymmetries in p p\u0304 and p p collisions.\nOur observation starts with the well known p p\u0304 kinematics. Let us remind the W + and W \u2212\nbosons are produced with the same dynamics due to the nature of the colliding beams. Indeed, the\nsame amount of matter and antimatter are available to produce a W + or a W \u2212 . The most visible\ndifference between the two processes occurs at the spatial level because the proton and anti-protons\nare always impinging respectively from the +z and \u2212z directions. Thus the kinematics between the\nW + and W \u2212 event samples differ only from a mirror reflection with respect to the r \u2212 \u03c6 plane passing\n\n\f4.2 Production of W+ and W\u2212 bosons\n\n(a) \u2212 p p\n\nd \u03c3/d yW [nb]\n\n1.5\n1.0\n\n2.0\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n\n0.0\n0.8\n\n0.0\n0.8\n\nAsym(+,\u2212)(yW )\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n0.0\n\u22120.4\n\u22125\n\n\u22124\n\n\u22123\n\n\u22122\n\n\u22121\n\n0\n\nyW\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n(c) \u2212 p p\n\n5\n\nW\n\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n\n0.0\n\u22120.4\n\u22120.8\n\n\u22125\n\n\u22124\n\n\u22123\n\n\u22122\n\n\u22121\n\n0\n\nyW\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n(d) \u2212 p p\n\n5\n\nW+\nW\u2212\n\n1.2\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n\nAsym(+,\u2212)(pT,W )\n\n0.0\n0.004\n0.002\n0.000\n\u22120.002\n\n\u22120.004\n0\n\n0.4\n\n1.4\n\nW+\n\u2212\n\nd \u03c3/d pT,W [nb/GeV]\n\nd \u03c3/d yW [nb]\nAsym(+,\u2212)(yW )\n\n2.0\n\n\u22120.8\n\nW+\nW\u2212\n\n2.5\n\nW\n\n1.2\n\nd \u03c3/d pT,W [nb/GeV]\n\n(b) \u2212 p p\n\nW+\n\u2212\n\n2.5\n\nAsym(+,\u2212)(pT,W )\n\n89\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\npT,W [GeV]\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n0.155\n0.150\n0.145\n0.140\n0.135\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\npT,W [GeV]\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\nFigure 4.1: The rapidity and transverse momentum distributions of the W bosons with their associated charge\nasymmetries for p p\u0304 (a, c) and p p (b, d) collisions.\n\nby the origin. More explicitly, to each phase space configuration of amplitude of probability M for\nthe W + boson corresponds another phase space configuration for the W \u2212 in which \u03b8W \u2212 = \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b8W +\nand that has the exact same amplitude. The evidence for this behaviour can be seen already for\nthe W bosons longitudinal component when looking at the rapidity (Fig. 4.1.(a)) where one can see\nthe W + and W \u2212 distributions are the same up to a vertical flip with respect to the yW = 0 origin.\nConcerning the W + and W \u2212 transverse momenta the symmetry is such that it makes no differences\nbetween the two channels when projecting on the r \u2212 \u03c6 plane as shown in Fig. 4.1.(c). From the\npoint of view of a MW extraction the important thing is that pT,W distributions are independent of\nthe W boson charge which means the leptons, as it will be confirmed, undergo the same boosts.\nNow Figures 4.1.(b) and (d) show the corresponding distributions for p p collisions. Here both\nrapidity distributions are symmetric with respect to yW = 0 which is the consequence of the identical\nnature of the colliding targets. The shapes of the spectra are different for the W + and W \u2212 bosons\nwhich reflects the difference in the valence u and d quark content and properties in a proton. The yW\ndistribution for the W + boson is higher and wider with respect to the one for the W \u2212 boson. First let\nus note there are twice as many valence u quarks as valence d quarks explaining the higher differential\ncross section for W + . Besides, u quarks carry, in average, a higher fraction x of the parent proton\nmomentum (cf. Fig. 1.11), which, assuming yW respects to a good approximation the LO expression\nof Eq. (1.60), implies that W + are more likely to have a higher absolute values rapidity. This explains\nthe wider behaviour of d \u03c3 + /d yW compared to d \u03c3 \u2212 /d yW .\n\n\f90\n\nPhenomenology of W+ and W\u2212 in Drell\u2013Yan like processes at the LHC\n\nThe charge asymmetry in the pT,W distribution reflects both the differences in the relative cross\nsections but also, what will be crucial for the studies presented in this Chapter, in the shape of their\ndistributions. The nontrivial shape of Asym(+,\u2212) (pT,W ) is due to the flavour asymmetries in the\ndistributions of quarks producing W + and W \u2212 bosons. The latter are predominantly driven by the\nu\u2013d quark asymmetries. Then the CKM mixing involves the other s, c and b flavours among which\n\u2013as it will be shown\u2013 the non equality of the s and c quark masses add up to the main u\u2013d charge\nasymmetries. This can be analysed with the flavour structure of the W bosons charge asymmetries\nby writing explicitly the simplified Born level formulaeof the total cross section charge asymmetries\nfor p p\u0304 and p p collisions\n\u0001\n\u03c3 + \u2212 \u03c3 \u2212 p p\u0304 (S) = 0,\n(4.1)\nZZ\nn\nh\ni\n\u0001\n \u0304 q\u0304 ) \u2212 d(v) (xq ) \u016b(xq\u0304 )\n\u03c3 + \u2212 \u03c3 \u2212 p p (S) \u221d\ndxq dxq\u0304 |Vud |2 u(v) (xq ) d(x\nh\ni\n+ u(v) (xq ) |Vus |2 s\u0304(xq\u0304 ) + |Vub |2 b\u0304(xq\u0304 )\no\n\u2212 |Vcd |2 d(v) (xq ) c\u0304(xq\u0304 ) \u03c3\u0303qq\u0304 (\u015d),\n(4.2)\n\nwhere in these expressions d, u, s, c and b on the right hand side denote the PDFs of the corresponding\nquark flavours and the (v) superscript stands for valence quarks, Vij is the CKM matrix element for\nthe i and j flavours, while \u03c3\u0303qq\u0304 (\u015d) is the \"CKM matrix element stripped\" partonic cross section for\nthe W boson production with \u015d = xq xq\u0304 S. Let us stress that the above expressions are over simplified\nfor pedagogical reasons and do not reflect the physics implemented in the WINHAC event generation.\nWe have omitted the explicit dependence of the PDFs on the factorisation scheme, on the transverse\nmomenta kT of annihilating partons present both in the \"kT -non integrated\" PDFs, and in the\npartonic cross sections (via kT dependence of \u015d). All the above effects are present in WINHAC. In our\nanalysis partons have both the primordial transverse momenta and the perturbative generated ones\nas modeled by the initial state parton shower of the Pythia generator. Their transverse momenta\ndepend on the Bjorken x of the annihilating (anti-)quark and, for heavy quarks (here c and b), also\non their masses (see Ref. [117] for more details).\nAs one can see in Eq. (4.1), the charge asymmetry disappears for the p p\u0304 collision mode if, as\nassumed in the presented studies MW + = MW \u2212 . Let us note that this equality holds no matter\nthe level of the corrections embraced in the calculus. Therefore, this collision scheme would be, on\na theoretical level, the optimal one for measuring MW + \u2212 MW \u2212 . Any deviation from the equality\nof the masses would result in non zero asymmetries regardless of the level of understanding of the\nflavour and momentum structure of the beam particles. For p p collisions several effects, reflecting the\npresent understanding of the partonic content of the beam particles \u2013in particular, the understanding\nof the momentum distribution of valence quarks\u2013 contribute to the charge asymmetry of the pT,W\ndistribution and may mimic MW + 6= MW \u2212 effects.\nThe asymmetries in p p collisions can be really reduced when going to isoscalar collisions. For\nexample in d d collisions the asymmetries in the quark flavour can be deduced easily from Eq. (4.2)\nby considering here u(x) = d(x). We obtain then\nZZ\nh\ni\n\u0001\n\u03c3 + \u2212 \u03c3 \u2212 d d (S) \u221d\ndxq dxq\u0304 u(v) (xq ) |Vus |2 s\u0304(xq\u0304 ) \u2212 |Vcd |2 c\u0304(xq\u0304 ) + |Vub |2 b\u0304(xq\u0304 ) \u03c3\u0303qq\u0304 (\u015d),\n(4.3)\nwhere here the PDFs have to be understood as the parton distributions functions inside a deuteron\ncontrary to Eqs. (4.1\u20134.2) where they were the one related to the proton. This was omitted on purpose\nnot to overload the expressions. Here then, the asymmetry is driven by the Cabibbo suppressed\ndifference of the distribution of the strange and charm quarks, weighted by the distributions of the\nvalence quarks. The d d collision scheme is introduced at this point in order to analyse the relative\nimportance of the valence quark and \"s \u2212 c\" effects.\nIn what follows the numerical importance of the various terms appearing in the above equations\nis studied. For that purpose, to visualise the size coming from certain quarks contributions we reject\n\n\f4.2 Production of W+ and W\u2212 bosons\n\n91\n\nall the contributions which we are not interested in (basically weight these events by zero) and in\nsome occasions we modify the predictions of the PDFs by hand using the framework described in\nFig. 3.7 of \u00a7 3.3.1.

The\ncharge asymmetry for p p collisions is large and is varying with pT,W .\n\n\f92\n\nPhenomenology of W+ and W\u2212 in Drell\u2013Yan like processes at the LHC\n\nThe next frame, (b), shows the comparison of the p p asymmetry from the previous plot with the\ncase where only the \"u \u2192\u2190 d\" contributions (u d \u0304 for W + production and d \u016b for W \u2212 production)\nhave been kept. The small gap between the two curves, compared to the size of the latter, reflects\nthe small overall influence of s, c and b flavours in the asymmetry compared to the contribution of\nthe u and d quarks.\nFrame (c) demonstrates this asymmetry is slightly reduced when in top of having only u and d\nquarks we have u(v) = 2 d(v) , i.e. when the u and d valence quark PDFs are assumed to have the\nsame shape and differ only by the normalisation factor corresponding to their number in the proton.\nIn addition, let us note that the asymmetry becomes flatter as a function of pT,W indicating the role\nof the relative x-shape of the u and d quarks PDFs. Finally, the asymmetry is reduced drastically\nwhen adding to the previous constraints u(v) = d(v) , as it would be the case when colliding isoscalar\nbeams. This shows the consequences of \u016b(s) < d \u0304(s) for 10\u22124 < x, which was found to be of the order\nof \u2248 0.05 %. In the rest of the plots the simplest isoscalar beam collision scheme, d d, is considered.\n\nThe frame (d) shows that the charge asymmetry for d d is much smaller than the one for p p with\nonly small discrepancies mainly at low pT,W . This results from the two following facts : (1) now all\nthe terms contributing to the charge asymmetry include only off-diagonal CKM matrix elements and\n(2) contributions of the s, c and b quark PDFs are smaller than the ones coming from sea u and d\nquark PDFs. Hence this shows how in p p collisions the bulk of the charge asymmetries comes from\nthe term \u221d |Vud |2 in Eq. (4.2).\n\nThe remaining charge asymmetry is at the level of 0.002 as can be seen in the zoomed frame (e)\nand it can be reduced to a statistically negligible level when setting c = s and rejecting b quarks\ncontributions. The first constraint, because |Vus |2 \u2248 |Vcd |2 , assures to cancel the two first terms in\nthe bracket of the RHS of Eq. (4.3) while the second finalise the rise of any asymmetry.\nFinally the frame (f) shows the effect of the deviation of the charge asymmetry due to the difference\nof the masses and of the momentum distributions of the strange and charm quarks in the extreme\ncase where the c contributions are rejected as well with the collisions involving b. In that case, the\nobtained asymmetry is significantly higher, at a level of 0.01 \u2212 0.015. It is a factor of \u223c 10 bigger than\nthe asymmetry for the d d collisions assuming the present understanding of the relative asymmetry\nin the distribution of the strange and charm quarks.\nIn the analysis presented so far the pT,W distribution is inclusive, in other words it has been\nintegrated over the full range of allowed xq and xq\u0304 . In order to optimise the measurement strategy of\nthe W mass charge asymmetry, we now discuss the charge asymmetry pT,W distributions restricted\nto selected kinematics regions. The most obvious method to reduce the contributions of the valence\nquarks is to restrict the analysis to the yW \u223c 0 region, where xq \u223c xq\u0304 \u2248 6 \u00d7 10\u22123 , i.e. where the\nvalence quarks are largely outnumbered by the sea quarks.\nFigure 4.3 presents the asymmetries for p p and d d collisions for the narrow central bins in the\nW rapidity (a), and in the lepton pseudo-rapidity (b). In the frame (a) the p p charge asymmetry is\nreduced and flattened by more than a factor of 3 for the range of the W boson rapidity yW < 0.3.\nNow since yW cannot be measured directly it is natural to check if a comparable reduction can be\nobtained using the \u03b7l variable which is correlated with yW . Unfortunately, this is not the case, as\nshown in frame (b). The \u03b7l variable has thus significantly lower discriminative power to reduce the\nvalence quark contribution with respect to the yW variable. For the d d collisions the asymmetry\nrestricted to the narrow \u03b7l bin increases considerably. This observation draws our attention to the\nfact that the asymmetry in the decay mechanism of the W + and W \u2212 bosons will have an important\nimpact on the asymmetry of leptonic observables. This will be discussed in detail in the next section.\nLet us conclude by noticing there can also be a contribution to the charge asymmetry coming\nfrom the QED radiation from quarks, as upper and lower components of quark doublets have different\nelectric charges. However, it was found with the Pythia parton shower model to be of the order of\nAsym(+,\u2212) (pT,W ) \u2248 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22124 , which is insignificant compared to the other previous contributions\nto the asymmetries for p p and d d.\n\n\f4.3 Decays of W+ and W\u2212 bosons\n\n93\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n0.15\n\n0.10\n\nAsym(+,\u2212)(pT,W )\n\nAsym(+,\u2212)(pT,W )\n\n0.15\n\np p inclusive\np p |yW | < 0.3\nd d inclusive\n\n0.05\n\n0.00\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n40\npT,W [GeV]\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n0.10\n\n0.05\n\n0.00\n0\n\np p inclusive\np p |\u03b7l | < 0.3\nd d inclusive\nd d |\u03b7l | < 0.3\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n40\npT,W [GeV]\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\nFigure 4.3: The charged asymmetries of pT,W for inclusive p p, d d collisions and with cuts : |yW | < 0.3 for pp (a)\nand |\u03b7l | < 0.3 for p p and d d (b).\n\n4.3\n\nDecays of W+ and W\u2212 bosons\n\nIn this section the W boson decay mechanism and its influence on the charge asymmetries are studied in both p p\u0304 and p p collisions by looking at the charged lepton pseudo-rapidity and transverse\nmomentum spectra.\nFirst, in an overview, we see why in p p\u0304 collisions we continue to observe perfectly symmetric\nfeatures while in p p collisions we observe larger charge asymmetries than in the initial state due to\nthe decay properties of the leptons. After that, to emphasise the arguments delivered in the previous\noverview a detailed description of the W + and W \u2212 decays in specific regions of yW -space is presented.\n\n4.3.1\n\nOverview in proton\u2013anti-proton and proton\u2013proton collisions\n\nFigure 4.4 presents the charged lepton \u03b7l and pT,l distributions along with their associated charge\nasymmetries. Let us start by noticing that when studying the pattern of the \u03b7l spectra the influence\nof pT,W can be neglected in the discussion since pT,W \u001c |~\npz,W |. More qualitatively, the improved LO\naffects the LO differential \u03b7l cross sections only to \u223c 4 % maximum, thus \u2013just in those cases\u2013 we\ncan consider p~z,W \u223c p~W .\nProton\u2013anti-proton collisions. Starting with p p\u0304 collisions one can see the \u03b7l distributions (Fig.\n4.4.(a)) are each other mirror reflection with respect to \u03b7l = 0 this being a consequence of the\nsymmetry of the problem as discussed in the previous section. Here it simply translates into that\nthe whole l+ event generation is exactly the same than the one of the l\u2212 up to the transformation\n\u03b8l \u2212 = \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b8l + .\nOnce again this symmetry implies that projecting the charged leptons momenta on the r \u2212\u03c6 plane\ngives identical pT,l distributions for positive and negative charges which is shown in Fig. 4.4.(c).\nProton\u2013proton collisions. For p p collisions, on the other hand, at first sight the positively and\nnegatively charged leptons display highly non symmetric behaviour between each other. The pseudorapidity distributions indicates that l+ leptons decay preferentially in the opposite direction of p~W\nwhile l\u2212 leptons display the inverse behaviour (Fig. 4.4.(b)). The size of the charge asymmetry in\npT,l is much larger than the one in pT,W and further investigations proved it is explained by the\nprivileged decay of l+ leptons in the direction of p~T,W while l\u2212 leptons decay in most cases in the\nopposite direction of p~T,W (Fig. 4.4.(d)). The reason for these two behaviours in \u03b7l and pT,l finds its\nfundamental origin in the V \u2212A coupling of the leptons to the W bosons.

(1.30)), Q is the W boson electric charge in units of |e|\nand \u03bb = 0, \u00b11 is the W boson helicity. As can be seen, the angular distributions of l+ and l\u2212 for\nlongitudinally polarised W bosons (WL for \u03bb = 0) are the same while for the transversely polarised\nW bosons (WT for \u03bb = \u00b11), they depend upon the W boson helicity. To simplify the rest of the\nargumentation we will not consider the decay of longitudinally polarised W . This leaves us with\ntransversely polarised W bosons which, due to the excess of matter from valence quarks1 in LHC\ncollisions, are produced in larger proportions with negative helicities, i.e. W (\u03bb = +1) < W (\u03bb = \u22121).\nThe consequences of this excess of W (\u03bb = \u22121) accounts for the behaviour of the pseudo-rapidity\ndistributions illustrated in Fig. 4.5 in both W RF and laboratory frame (LAB) : l\u2212 access larger\npseudo-rapidity than the l+ . Note this behaviour is already observed at leading order where pT,W = 0\n1\n\nFrom another point of view the charge asymmetries can be seen as the consequence of a lack of anti-matter (valence\nanti-quarks) that cannot match this excess of matter from valence quarks.\n\n\f4.3 Decays of W+ and W\u2212 bosons\n\n95\n\nand is only slightly affected by pT,W in the improved LO.

Below, in the W RF, the consequent\nazimuthal anisotropy with respect to the p\n~T,W direction is represented for the decay of the charged leptons (down).\nAs explained above a deeper investigation shows the l+ leptons decay preferentially in the direction\nof p~T,W while the l\u2212 lepton display the inverse behaviour. This effect is the result of the V \u2212 A\ncoupling properties folded to the transverse motion of the W or, more precisely, the relative size of\nthe valence and sea (anti-)quarks in the collision. Indeed, in a collision involving a valence quark the\nsea anti-quark carries in general a higher transverse motion (cf. \u00a7 4.A.6) which, as can be understood\nusing kinematic momentum conservation rules of thumb, constrains the charged lepton to privilege a\ncertain azimuthal direction depending on the helicity it is holding. Figure 4.6 illustrates these effects,\nsince the l+ leptons have a positive helicity, aligning it on the one of the sea quarks constrains it to\ndecay in the same direction of the q\u0304 0 (s) anti-quark and by extension, since the latter carries most of\nthe transverse motion, with the one of p~T,W . On the other hand negative helicity l\u2212 leptons, under\n\n\f96\n\nPhenomenology of W+ and W\u2212 in Drell\u2013Yan like processes at the LHC\n\nthe same kinematics, are constrained to prefer a decay in the opposite direction of the q\u0304 0 (s) antiquark/~\npT,W . Eventually it turns out the l+ leptons intrinsic transverse momentum are amplified by\npT,W while in the case of the l\u2212 leptons they are reduced by pT,W . Let us emphasise that even though\nthis effect is ignited by the V \u2212 A coupling attribute its amplitude depends of the relative unbalance\nin the transverse\u221amotion of the colliding valence quark and sea anti-quark, which is governed by the\ncolliding energy S in the center of mass. Also worth noticing is that even at the leading order there\nare already charge asymmetries in the pT,l spectra, still, due to their smaller size with respect to the\none discussed above, their study is treated in \u00a7 4.A.4.\nIn the rest of this section the previous distributions are reviewed for two narrow absolute rapidity\nregions, respectively in a central domain (|yW | < 0.3) and in a forward domain (3.5 < |yW | < 4.5). In\nthe central region, the W bosons are produced from quark\u2013anti-quark pairs having xq \u223c xq\u0304 \u2248 6\u00d710\u22123\nleading to small valence quarks contributions, and as a consequence, the assumed isospin symmetry\nin sea quarks flavours cannot produce charge asymmetries. On the other hand, in the forward region\nthe production of W bosons involve most of the time a a valence (anti-)quark in p p\u0304 collisions and a\nvalence quark in p p collisions.\n\n4.3.2\n\nProton\u2013anti-protons collisions\n\nThe explanations in this subsection can be followed looking at Fig. 4.7 showing the \u03b7l , pT,l and\nAsym(+,\u2212) (pT,l ) distributions in |yW | < 0.3 and 3.5 < |yW | < 4.5 rapidity regions.\nyW\n\n\u22126\n\n\u22124\n\n(a) \u2212 p p, |yW | < 0.3\n\u22122\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\nyW\n\n6\n\nW+\nW\u2212\n\n(b) \u2212 p p, 3.5 < |yW | < 4.5\n\n\u22126\n\n\u22124\n\n\u22122\n\n0\n\n\u22126\n\n\u22124\n\n\u22122\n\n\u03b7l\n\n\u22126\n\n\u22124\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\nW+\nW\u2212\n\n0.75\n\nd \u03c3/d \u03b7l [nb]\n\nd \u03c3/d \u03b7l [nb]\n\n0.50\n\n0.25\n\n0.50\n\n0.25\n\nd \u03c3/d pT,l [nb/GeV]\n\nyW\n0.06\n\n\u22126\n\n\u22124\n\n\u22126\n\n\u22124\n\n\u22122\n\n0\n\n\u03b7l\n\n2\n\n(c) \u2212 p p, |yW | < 0.3\n\u22122\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n4\n\n6\n\n0.00\n\nyW\n\nW+\nW\u2212\n\nd \u03c3/d pT,l [nb/GeV]\n\n0.00\n\n0.04\n\n0.02\n\n0.005\n0.000\n\u22120.005\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n(d) \u2212 p p, 3.5 < |yW | < 4.5\n\u22122\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\nW+\nW\u2212\n\n0.08\n0.06\n0.04\n0.02\n0.00\n\nAsym(+,\u2212)(pT,l )\n\nAsym(+,\u2212)(pT,l )\n\n0.00\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\npT,l [GeV]\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n0.005\n0.000\n\u22120.005\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\npT,l [GeV]\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\nFigure 4.7: Positively and negatively charged lepton pseudo-rapidity distributions for p p\u0304 collisions in two different\nranges of the W rapidity : |yW | < 0.3 (a,c) and 3.5 < |yW | < 4.5 (b,d).\n\n\f4.3 Decays of W+ and W\u2212 bosons\n\n97\n\nW+ and W\u2212 pseudo-rapidity distributions. In the narrow central rapidity region as it has\nbeen established valence (anti-)quark contributions are rather small, then l+ and l\u2212 leptons display\nin a first approximation the same behaviour. The discrepancies come from the small influence of\nvalence (anti-)quarks.\nIn the forward rapidity region the valence (anti-)quarks influence creates large local asymmetries\nin both \u03b7l+ and \u03b7l\u2212 distributions. Those behaviours can be understood looking at the pseudo-rapidity.\nUsing the LO approximation from Eq. (1.70) gives\n\u03b7l +\n\u03b7l \u2212\n\n\u2248 yW + yl\u2217+ ,\n\u2248 yW +\n\nyl\u2217\u2212 ,\n\n(4.6)\n(4.7)\n\nwhere yl\u2217+ and yl\u2217\u2212 are respectively the intrinsic rapidity of the positively and negatively charged\nleptons. The rapidity of the W is much larger than the intrinsic yl\u2217\u00b1 (cf. \u00a7 1.4.2), also the pattern\nof the distributions in Fig. 4.7.(b) can be seen as the consequence of : (1) the high longitudinal\npz,W (\u21d4 yW ) component of the boost that fixes roughly the center of the \u03b7l spectrum at \u03b7l \u2248 yW and\n(2) the polar decay of the lepton \u2013ruled by the V \u2212 A coupling\u2013 which smears the \u03b7l distribution from\nthe central \"yW -induced\" value. Let us look at the case of the lepton l+ . In the region 3.5 < yW < 4.5,\n(v) (s)\nW + bosons are produced mainly via up d \u0304p\u0304 pair collision, where for reminder (v) stands for valence\nand (s) for sea. In other words we have mostly W + (\u03bb = \u22121) which, combined to the V \u2212 A coupling\nconstrain the decaying l+ to be preferentially emitted in the opposite direction to p~W + . This can be\nseen as most of the \u03b7l+ distribution tends to shift to lower values of \u03b7l . On the other side, where\n(s) (v)\n\u22124.5 < yW < \u22123.5, bosons are produced mainly via up d \u0304p\u0304 annihilation which gives W + (\u03bb = +1).\nHere the decaying l+ lepton prefers to be emitted following the p~W + direction. Let us note the\n(v)\n(v)\ndifference of height between two opposite \u03b7l bumps comes from the fact that d \u0304p\u0304 < up . The same\nideas can be applied to the case of the l\u2212 lepton decay, this time the opposite behaviour is observed\nwith the exact same proportions\nW+ and W\u2212 transverse momenta distributions. The forward rapidity region is exclusively\naddressed as we know the issues related to the valence contributions are more important there. In\nthe W RF, the spectrum of the relative angle between the l+ and the W + in 3.5 < yW < 4.5 is exactly\nthe same than the one between the l\u2212 and the W \u2212 in \u22124.5 < yW < \u22123.5 as shown in Fig. 4.7.(b).\nThis is true independently of the relative unbalance in the colliding quark\u2013anti-quark pT , thus the\nW boost are identical and give eventually the same kinematics \u2013up to a vertical flip\u2013 for the l+ and\nl\u2212 from these opposite yW -space domains. The same idea can be used to account for the equality of\nthe pT,l+ distribution in \u22124.5 < yW < \u22123.5 with the pT,l\u2212 distribution in 3.5 < yW < 4.5. Then, as\nlong the rapidity selection is achieved on the absolute value |yW | the positive and negative leptons\ntransverse momenta show no asymmetries as displayed in Fig. 4.7.(d). This property is obviously\nconserved when integrating over the whole phase space.\n\n4.3.3\n\nProton\u2013proton collisions\n\nConsidering now the case of p p collisions we repeat the same path of reasoning followed for the p p\u0304\ncase. The \u03b7l and pT,l distributions in p p collisions for the narrow central and forward W rapidity\nregions are shown in Fig. 4.8.\nPseudo-rapidity distributions. Once again going to |yW | < 0.3 allows to get rid of most of the\nvalence quarks which, as it was found out in the overview is the source of the asymmetries in p p\ncollisions (Fig. 4.8.(a)). The small discrepancies are due to non negligible contributions from valence\nquarks.\nNow moving to the 3.5 < |yW | < 4.5 region (Fig. 4.8.(b)) the general pattern can be understood\nusing Eqs. (4.6\u20134.7). Both \u03b7l+ and \u03b7l\u2212 distributions are found in the vicinity of |\u03b7l | \u2248 |yW | and the\n\n\f98\n\nPhenomenology of W+ and W\u2212 in Drell\u2013Yan like processes at the LHC\nyW\n\n\u22126\n\n\u22124\n\n(a) \u2212 p p, |yW | < 0.3\n\u22122\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\nyW\n\n6\n\nW+\n\u2212\nW\n\n(b) \u2212 p p, 3.5 < |yW | < 4.5\n\n\u22126\n\n\u22124\n\n\u22122\n\n0\n\n\u22126\n\n\u22124\n\n\u22122\n\n\u03b7l\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\nW+\nW\u2212\n\n0.75\n\nd \u03c3/d \u03b7l [nb]\n\nd \u03c3/d \u03b7l [nb]\n\n0.50\n\n0.25\n\n0.50\n\n0.25\n\nd \u03c3/d pT,l [nb/GeV]\n\nyW\n\n\u22126\n\n\u22124\n\n\u22126\n\n\u22124\n\n\u22122\n\n0\n\n\u03b7l\n\n2\n\n(c) \u2212 p p, |yW | < 0.3\n\u22122\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n0.00\n\n6\n\n4\n\nyW\n\n6\n\nW+\nW\u2212\n\n0.06\n\nd \u03c3/d pT,l [nb/GeV]\n\n0.00\n\n0.04\n0.02\n\n0.06\n0.04\n0.02\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n(d) \u2212 p p, 3.5 < |yW | < 4.5\n\n\u22126\n\n\u22124\n\n\u22122\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\nW+\nW\u2212\n\n0.10\n0.08\n0.06\n0.04\n0.02\n0.00\n\nAsym(+,\u2212)(pT,l )\n\nAsym(+,\u2212)(pT,l )\n\n0.00\n\n0.12\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\npT,l [GeV]\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\npT,l [GeV]\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\nFigure 4.8: Positively and negatively charged lepton pseudo-rapidity/transverse momenta distributions for ranges of\nthe W rapidity : |yW | < 0.3 (a,c) and 3.5 < |yW | < 4.5 (b,d).\n\ndeviations from this central value are due to lepton decay in \u03b8 ruled by the V \u2212 A coupling, i.e. only\npositive helicity l+ and negative helicity l\u2212 can couple to W bosons.\nWe start by analysing the positively charge lepton l+ . Here, in both positive (3.5 < yW < 4.5)\n(v) (s)\nand negative (\u22124.5 < yW < \u22123.5) rapidity domains the W + are produced most likely from a up dp\nannihilation providing to the boson a negative helicity. Then the l+ preferentially decay in the\nopposite direction of p~W . This explains why the \u03b7l+ spectrum is slightly shifted to smaller absolute\n\u03b7l values. The same idea can be applied to the other charged lepton. One finds eventually that\nthis time the l\u2212 decays in most cases in the same direction of p~W which translates here that the\n\u03b7l\u2212 spectrum is slightly shifted to higher absolute values of \u03b7l . This explains why we observed in\nFig. 4.4.(b) a widening of the l\u2212 pseudo-rapidity distribution from yW \u2212 while the l+ pseudo-rapidity\ntends to narrow from the inner yW + spectrum. The relative size of the peaks is explained to the light\nthat, as said previously, in a proton there are more u(v) than d(v) .\nLet us stress that the differences between the yW -bands width and the associated spread \u03b7l\ndistributions demonstrates that \u03b7l has a significantly weaker resolution power for the momenta of\nannihilating quarks than yW , and, as a consequence, weaker resolving power of the W boson polarisation. This gives already an idea of the loss of information one has to accept when trading the\nknowledge of the W rapidity with the charged lepton pseudo-rapidity.\n\n\f4.3 Decays of W+ and W\u2212 bosons\n\n99\n\nTransverse momenta distributions in forward rapidity region. The behaviour of the charged\nlepton transverse momenta are discussed exclusively in the forward rapidity region (Fig. 4.8.(d)). For\n3.5 < yW < 4.5, in the W RF the relative angle between the l+ and the W + is different from the one\nof l\u2212 and the W \u2212 due to the larger value of the sea quark transverse momentum with respect to the\none of the valence quark. The V \u2212 A coupling as shown in Fig. 4.6, by forcing the l+ and l\u2212 to decay\nin opposite direction induce the l+ to follow the transverse motion held mostly by the sea quark while\nthe l\u2212 decays in the opposite direction of the latter. Taking into consideration the negative rapidity\nstripe concurs to roughly double the size of the asymmetry. The consequences of this effect on the\npattern of the transverse momenta of the l+ and l\u2212 has dramatic effects.\n\u2217 spectra\nFigure 4.9 quantifies this important aspect at the inclusive level by displaying the \u03c6W,l\nwhich is defined as the azimuthal angle of the charged lepton in the W RF with respect to the direction\nof the transverse momentum of the W boson in the laboratory frame, that is\n!\n\u2217\np\n~\n*\np\n~\nT,W\nT,l\n\u2217\n\u03c6W,l\n\u2261 cos\u22121\n(4.8)\n\u2217 | .\n|~\npT,W | |~\npT,l\n\u2217\np p, \u03c6W,l\n8.0\n\nW+\nW\u2212\n\n\u2217\nd \u03c3/d \u03c6W,l\n[nb]\n\n7.0\n6.0\n5.0\n4.0\n3.0\n2.0\n1.0\n\u2217\nAsym(+,\u2212)(\u03c6W,l\n)\n\n0.0\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n0.00 0.25 0.50 0.75 1.00 1.25 1.50 1.75 2.00 2.25 2.50 2.75 3.00\n\u2217\n\u03c6W,l\n[rad]\n\n\u2217\nFigure 4.9: Distributions of \u03c6W,l\nin p p collisions showing the azimuthal anisotropy in the charged leptons decays.\n\nIn conclusion the absence of valence anti-quarks makes the production of W + and W \u2212 at the\nLHC irretrievably different. The increase of the transverse momenta of the W bosons produced at\nhigh absolute rapidity amplifies the impact of the W boson polarisation asymmetry on the charge\nasymmetry of its decay products. These effects will give rise to important measurement biases which\nwere not present in the p p\u0304 collision mode but will show up in the measurement of the W boson\nproperties in the LHC p p collision mode.\nIn order to illustrate a little bit more the charge asymmetry in pT,l Figure 4.10.(a) shows the\nimperfect match between the d \u03c3 + /d pT,l and d \u03c3 + /d pT,l histograms when normalised to unit. This\ndemonstrates that the difference of scale being removed the discrepancies are important enough to be\nnoticed by the eye. Especially frame (b) shows a zoom on the jacobian peak which shape is of crucial\nimportance for the extraction of the W boson mass.

The selection in \u03b7l being justified to show how\nthe ambiguity becomes large when making a selection with the latter. This gives complements on\nthe low x-selection resolution one have to deal when relying on \u03b7l rather than yW . To quantify the\nimpact on the jacobian peak position we applied an empirical procedure consisting into fitting pT,l+\nand pT,l\u2212 spectra by a polynomial of second order in the vicinity of the peak. This range was taken\nto be 37 GeV < pT,l < 40 GeV. The pT,l value corresponding to the two parabolas are noted $+ for\npT,l+ and $\u2212 for the one of pT,l\u2212 . The difference between these two position $+ \u2212 $\u2212 is considered\nto quantify the variation of the peaks position.

As these\ndifferences could mimic the asymmetry in the masses of positively and negatively charged W boson,\nall these effects must be controlled to a high precision and/or, as advocated in our work, eliminated\nby using LHC dedicated measurement strategy.\n\n\f102\n\nPhenomenology of W+ and W\u2212 in Drell\u2013Yan like processes at the LHC\n\nFinally let us remind the reader the above presentation is addressing only the essential points to\nunderstand the original LHC features.

To reach\nthis goal a few observables related to the W boson and the charged leptons were considered, each\nallowing to comprehend both dynamic and kinematic issues from different point of views. Although\nsome histograms below were not addressed in the core of the Chapter it has to be realised that the\nmaterial presented here is the bulk of the work achieved which allowed to present previously the gist\nof W physics features in Drell\u2013Yan at the LHC.\n\n4.A.1\n\nObservables and context of the discussion\n\nThe study the W boson properties is made looking at its invariant mass mW defined like\nq\n2 \u2212p\n2,\nmW \u2261 EW\n~W\n\n(4.12)\n\nits rapidity yW and its transverse momentum pT,W .\nThe study of the charged lepton properties are made by analysing its pseudo-rapidity \u03b7l and its\ntransverse momentum pT,l . The study of the charged lepton angular decay in the W RF relatively\n\u2217\nto the W motion is quantified with the angle \u03b8W,l\ndefined as the opening angle between the charged\nlepton in the W RF and the direction of the W boson in the laboratory frame, which analytically\nreads\np~W * p~l\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2261\ncos \u03b8W,l\n.\n(4.13)\n|~\npW | |~\npl\u2217 |\nDue to the importance of the transverse direction for the extraction of the W properties we consider as\nwell the angle \u03c6\u2217W,l corresponding to the opening angle of the charged lepton transverse momentum\nin the W RF with the direction of the W transverse momentum in the laboratory frame, which\nanalytically translates to\n!\n\u2217\np\n~\n*\np\n~\nT,W\nT,l\n\u03c6\u2217W,l \u2261 cos\u22121\n(4.14)\n\u2217 | .\n|~\npT,W | |~\npT,l\n\nSome of the previous variables are studied in bins of yW and \u03b7l to emphasise the variation of the\ncharge asymmetries in function of the phase space region considered. Not to overload the discussion\nall those observables will not be discussed for each case but rather the most important one to draw\nrelevant conclusions.\nThese variables being reminded we state a few conventions adopted throughout the rest of the Appendix. First, let us remind the notation W indifferently stands for W + or W \u2212 and that respectively\nl stands for l+ or l\u2212 .\n\n\u2022\n\n\f\u2022\n\n104\n\nPhenomenology of W+ and W\u2212 in Drell\u2013Yan like processes at the LHC\n\nNow, for convenience, the production of W bosons is considered to be the addition of two type\nof contributions : (1) the contributions involving at least one valence (anti-)quark and (2) the contributions involving only sea quarks. Due to the isospin symmetry q (s) = q\u0304 (s) assumed in our model\n(CTEQ6.1M) the observed charged asymmetries are, as we will see, to be charged to the contributions\nof type (1). In top of that, for argumentation, we will always consider regions of the phase space\nwhere these valence (anti-)quarks asymmetries contribute the most, i.e. we will always implicitly\nassume in our examples the most probable cases where the valence (anti-)quark has a more larger\n(v)\n(s)\nlongitudinal momentum than the one of the sea (anti-)quark it enters in collisions with : xq,q\u0304 > xq,q\u0304 .\nIn the case of protons\u2013anti-protons collisions valence quark and\n\u221a valence anti-quarks collisions happen\ntoo but they can be neglected in the discussion. Indeed, at S = 14 TeV, if one of the valence (anti(\u2212)\n)quark possesses a high fraction of the longitudinal momentum of the hadron p it belongs to, say\n10\u22121 . x1 , then the other valence (anti-)quark in the collision must carry, due to the rough constrain\n2 , a fraction of momentum verifying x . 4 \u00d7 10\u22124 . As Figure 1.11 shows it, finding\nx 1 x 2 S \u223c MW\n2\na valence (anti-)quark at such low x is negligible. Hence, in p p\u0304 or LHC collisions, when addressing\nissues centered on valence (anti-)quark, we will always discuss valence\u2013sea collisions that hereafter\nwill be mentioned as \"valence\" collisions/contributions.\nAnother important aspect in the upcoming discussion consists to address the decaying angle of\nthe charged leptons with respect to the W motion. For that matter the emphasis will be given to the\ntransverse polarisation states of the W which gives different decaying angle between the positively\nand negatively charged lepton as seen in Eq. (4.4). For the longitudinal W bosons (Eq. (4.5)) the\ndecays of the leptons are charge independent, hence the charge discrepancies that can be observed\nare only due to the difference between the kinematics of the W + and the W \u2212 specific to the collision\nmode under consideration. These charge asymmetries are of lesser importance compared to the one\nconsequent to the decay of transversely polarised W bosons and will maybe studied in future works.\nAlso let us stress that some of the plots and explanations below are already present in the core\nof the Chapter but, for convenience, they were reviewed to make this Appendix fully understandable\nand complete by itself.\nIn what follows the description of hadron\u2013hadron collisions are considered for the cases of :\n\u221a\n- Hadron\u2013hadron collisions with no valence quark inside the hadrons with S = 14 TeV.\n\u221a\n- p p\u0304 collisions with S = 14 TeV.\n\u221a\n- p p collisions with S = 14 TeV.\n\u221a\n- d d collisions with S = 7 TeV.\n\u221a\nwhere each time S refers to the energy in the nucleon\u2013nucleon center of mass inertia frame. After\nthose points a discussion on the relative transverse motion of the quarks and anti-quark is provided.\n\n\f4.A Detailed description of W in Drell\u2013Yan for pp\u0304, p p and d d collisions\n\n4.A.2\n\n105\n\nA study of the purely sea contributions\n\nWe start this discussion by looking at the fictitious case where there is no valence (anti-)quarks in\nthe hadrons entering in collision. This illustrates that in the assumed isospin symmetry there are\nabsolutely no charge asymmetries. For that matter we remove manually the valence terms from the\nCTEQ6.1M previsions and run p p collisions which, in the present context, is equivalent to the p p\u0304\n(\u2212)\nmode, explaining the pp notation afterward.

Indeed, as can be seen in Fig. 4.13 the\nleptons preferentially decay in the direction of the momentum of the W which means \u2013using helicity\nconversation rule of thumb\u2013 that W + (\u03bb = \u22121) < W + (\u03bb = +1) and W \u2212 (\u03bb = \u22121) > W \u2212 (\u03bb = +1).\nThis can be understood by considering the four main contributions to the W + production. If we\nignore the negligible contributions involving the b\u0304 flavour we are left with : a : u(s) d \u0304(s) |Vud |2 ,\nb : u(s) s\u0304 |Vus |2 , c : c d \u0304(s) |Vcd |2 , d : c s\u0304 |Vcs |2 . In the case b the quark u(s) possesses in\ngeneral a higher longitudinal momentum than the quark s\u0304 it enters in collision with which means\n\n\u2022\n\n\f106\n\nPhenomenology of W+ and W\u2212 in Drell\u2013Yan like processes at the LHC\n\nxu(s) > xs\u0304 \u21d2 W + (\u03bb = \u22121) > W + (\u03bb = +1). On the other hand in the cases a , c and d , it is the\nother way around2 , i.e. xq\u0304 > xq which means now W + (\u03bb = \u22121) < W + (\u03bb = +1). This hypothesis is\nproved when looking at the individual behaviour of these four contributions in Fig. 4.13.(b), where, to\nfit the present range in coordinate, the b and c contributions are respectively multiplied by factors\n10 and 8.

Note these invariant masses are to be understood as the result of the\nproduction of W bosons as Breit\u2013Wigner resonances weighted by the PDFs, which adds up to the\nformer behaviour the probability of occurrence of a given mass mW . Hence, even if here mW + = mW \u2212\nsuch an equality is non trivial and has to be seen as the consequence that W + and W \u2212 are produced\nwith the same dynamics in the very particular case of p p\u0304 collisions.\nThe observables yW , pT,W , \u03b7l and pT,l are shown in Fig. 4.16. In p p\u0304 collisions the production of the\nW + and of the W \u2212 are produced with the same dynamics since to every element of the phase-space\nof, say the W + , exists the perfect CP match in an other phase-space point of W \u2212 . This symmetry\ntranslates in coordinate space into that the W + (l+ ) and W \u2212 (l\u2212 ) kinematics are the same up to a\nvertical flip with respect to the interaction point. This behaviour can be seen in the yW and \u03b7l\ndistributions but is no longer decipherable when projecting the W or the charged lepton transverse\nmomenta on the transverse plane. Note in the yW and \u03b7l distributions the labels e and f attached\nto the W + data. Focusing on the main \"valence\" term u d \u0304|Vud |2 , in each of these regions the W +\n(s)\n(v)\n(v)\n(s)\nare produced respectively via e : up \u2192\u2190\u2212 d \u0304p\u0304 and f : up \u2212\u2192\u2190 d \u0304p\u0304 for which the inequality\n(v)\ne < f materialises the fact that since d \u0304(v)\np\u0304 \u2261 dp we have\n(v)\nd(v)\np < up .\n\n(4.15)\n\nThis last inequality explains the presence of the exact same asymmetry for the case of the W \u2212\nproduction.\n\u2217\n\u2217\nThe angular distributions of cos \u03b8W,l\nand \u03c6W,l\nare shown in Fig. 4.17. We start by looking at\n\u2217\n+\n\u2212\ncos \u03b8W,l . Both W and W distributions are superimposed and display a small asymmetry with\nrespect to the origin. This pattern can be explained by focusing on the W + and the two labels\ng and h attached to it in Fig. 4.17.(b).

(4.15). Previously, while studying the pure sea contributions, the inverse unbalance was\nobserved, but now the main \"valence\" term u d \u0304|Vud |2 overrules the latter.\nNow even more interesting is the fact that Fig. 4.17 shows l+ and l\u2212 preferentially decays in\nthe same direction of pT,W which, as we know, must have dramatic consequences on the smearing\nof the pT,l distributions. Before explaining what happens we take a step back to the LO order\nand understand how the lack of transverse motion in this approximation induce no asymmetry in\nthe azimuthal decay of the leptons. Figure 4.18 shows the collinear quark\u2013anti-quark collisions of\nq (v) q\u0304 (s) (left) and q (s) q\u0304 (v) (right). In both cases the valence quarks hold most of the longitudinal\nmomentum and the privileged direction of decays of the positively and negatively charged leptons\n(symbolised in the W RF) which, even if opposite with each other, do not induce any anisotropic\nbehaviour in \u03c6. Moving to the improved leading order picture, now quarks and anti-quarks possess\na transverse initial motion and radiate gluons and photons on their way to the collision. We end\nup this time with \"valence\" cases with the valence (anti-)quark that bears most of the longitudinal\nmomentum and on the other side the sea (anti-)quark which bears most of the transverse motion.\nIn this context the higher transverse momentum of the sea (anti-)quark constrain the leptons to\nmodify their privileged decaying angle to satisfy the kinematic momentum conservation as shown\nin Fig. 4.18 Hence for q (v) q\u0304 (s) events the l+ decays preferentially along the direction of pT,W while\nthe l\u2212 decays preferentially in the opposite direction of pT,W . In the case of q (s) q\u0304 (v) it is the exact\n\n\f4.A Detailed description of W in Drell\u2013Yan for pp\u0304, p p and d d collisions\n\nW+\nW\u2212\n\ng\n\n10.0\n\nW+\nW\u2212\n\ni\n\u2217\nd \u03c3/d \u03c6W,l\n[nb]\n\n12.5\n\n\u2217\n(b) \u2212 p p, \u03c6W,l\n\n6.00\n\nh\n\n7.5\n5.0\n\n5.75\n\nj\n5.50\n\n2.5\n0.0\n0.0025\n\n\u2217\nAsym(+,\u2212)(\u03c6W,l\n)\n\n\u2217\nAsym(+,\u2212)(cos \u03b8W,l\n)\n\n\u2217\nd \u03c3/d cos \u03b8W,l\n[nb]\n\n\u2217\n(b) \u2212 p p, cos \u03b8W,l\n\n109\n\n0.0000\n\n\u22120.0025\n\u22121.00 \u22120.75 \u22120.50 \u22120.25\n\n0.00\u2217\n\ncos \u03b8W,l\n\n0.25\n\n0.50\n\n0.75\n\n1.00\n\n0.0025\n0.0000\n\n\u22120.0025\n0.00 0.25 0.50 0.75 1.00 1.25 1.50 1.75 2.00 2.25 2.50 2.75 3.00\n\u2217\n\u03c6W,l\n[rad]\n\n\u2217\n\u2217\nFigure 4.17: Distributions of cos \u03b8W,l\n(a) and \u03c6W,l\n(b) in p p\u0304 collisions.\n\nSchematic representation of the privileged angular decay\nof the charged lepton in the W rest frame\n\nq (v)\nl\n\nl+\n\n+\n\nl\n\nq\u0304 (s)\n\n\u2212\n\ny\u2032\n\nl\n\ny\u2032\n\nl+\n\nl\u2212\n\nz\u2032\n\nx\u2032\n\n(a)\n\nq (s)\n\nz\u2032\n\nx\u2032\n\n+\n\nl\n\ny\u2032\n\nz\u2032\n\nl\u2212\nx\u2032\n\nq\u0304 (v)\n\n\u2212\n\ny\u2032\n\nz\u2032\n\nx\u2032\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 4.18: Schematic representations of the decay of the charged leptons at the leading order.

The same argument can explain the asymmetry observed in the negative\nchannel. So far, while the fact the valence (anti-)quark hold most of the longitudinal momentum is\nwell known, we did not justified the fact that the sea (anti-)quark hold most of the transverse motion.\nThe very last section of this Appendix address this issue. For now we can justify it heuristically\nby stating that the sea (anti-)quark having a small fraction x is the result of the loss of energy on\nthe way to the collision by gluon/photon emission which confers to the (anti-)quark more transverse\n\n\u2022\n\n\f\u2022\n\n110\n\nPhenomenology of W+ and W\u2212 in Drell\u2013Yan like processes at the LHC\n\nl\u2212\nq (v)\n\nq\u0304 (s)\n\nq (s)\n\np~T,W\n\nl+\n\np~T,W\n\ny\u2032\n\ny\u2032\n\nl+\n\nl\u2212\nz\u2032\n\nx\u2032\n\np~T,W\n\nz\u2032\n\np~T,W\n\n(a)\n\nq\u0304 (v)\n\nl\u2212\n\nl+\n\nl+\n\nx\u2032\n\ny\u2032\n\nz\u2032\n\nl\u2212\nx\u2032\n\np~T,W\n\ny\u2032\n\nz\u2032\n\nx\u2032\n\np~T,W\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 4.19: Schematic representations of the decay of the charged leptons at the improved leading order. For\nconvenience, even though the quarks are represented in the laboratory frame the decay of the charged leptons are\nsymbolised in the W RF. Frame (a) represents the case of \"valence\" contribution involving a quark of valence while\nframe (b) displays the case of \"valence\" contribution involving an anti-quark of valence.\n\nmotion than the valence (anti-)quark.\nFigure 4.20 by showing the \u03b7l distribution in bins of yW and vice versa illustrates the importance\nof the \"valence\" contributions in function of the fraction of momentum xq,q\u0304 . Starting with \u03b7l in bins of\nyW (left) we see the pseudo-rapidity distribution is the addition of two quantities : (1) the rapidity yW\ninherited from the W boost and that confers to the charged lepton most of its longitudinal motion and\n(2) the decay of the charged lepton governed by the V \u2212 A coupling of leptons to W which eventually\ngives this bump representing the angular coverage of the charged leptons \u03b8l \u2208 [0, \u03c0]. Let us remind\npT,W participates in the shape of (2) but can be neglected in this discussion since pT,W \u001c |~\npz,W |. In\nthe narrow central bin region where all events verify |yW | < 0.5 the small charge asymmetry is due\nto non-negligible \"valence\" quark contributions. As the selection in rapidity increases, the \"valence\"\ncontributions rise displaying in consequence large charge asymmetries in the lepton decay for a local\nvalue of \u03b7l . Turning to 3.5 < |yW | < 4.5, for the negative values of \u03b7l the \"valence\" contributions\n(v)\n \u0304(v) give W + (\u03bb = +1) bosons while l : d(s)\nk : u(s)\ngive W \u2212 (\u03bb = +1)\np \u2192\u2190\u2212 dp\u0304\np \u2192\u2190\u2212 \u016bp\u0304\nbosons. The \"valence\" terms contribute then in both cases to produce right W bosons, which imply\nthe l+ (l\u2212 ) decays preferentially in the same(opposite) direction of the W momentum. Going to the\npositive value of \u03b7l is achieved by taking the CP transformation of the previous example, this time\n(v)\n(s)\n(v)\n(s)\nwe have m : up \u2212\u2192\u2190 d \u0304p\u0304 giving W + (\u03bb = \u22121) bosons and n : dp \u2212\u2192\u2190 \u016bp\u0304 W \u2212 (\u03bb = \u22121)\nbosons. Note that considering at the same time those two opposite yW -phase space regions completely\nreestablish the equivalence in the dynamic production of the W + and the W \u2212 bosons which, using\nthe label notation, would write k + m \u2261 l + n .\nOn the right of Fig. 4.20 the yW distributions in bins of \u03b7l hold more or less the same information\nthan the previous plots. Here though, looking at the yW variable allows to look at the smearing of\nthe distributions from the W boost point of view while earlier the smearing was essentially the one\narising from the V \u2212 A coupling of the charged leptons to the W . Also now we can see that a given\nslice of \u03b7l receives contributions from an important range of different yW rapidity. Although it is not\nimportant here as no p p\u0304 collisions can be made at the LHC it will give insight for LHC collisions\nat which level the narrow \u03b7l selection in our analysis are contaminated by high rapidity region and\nhence from \"valence\" contributions.\n\n\f4.A Detailed description of W in Drell\u2013Yan for pp\u0304, p p and d d collisions\np p, \u03b7l in bins of yW\n\n1.25\n\nW\n\n0.75\n0.50\n0.25\n0.00\n\n\u22126\n\n\u22124\n\n\u22122\n\n0\n\n\u03b7l\n\n2\n\n4\n\n0.50\n\n\u22126\n\n\u22124\n\n\u22122\n\n0\n\n\u03b7l\n\n2\n\n4\n\n4\n\n6\n\nW+\nW\u2212\n\n0.50\n\n0.75\n0.50\n\n\u22126\n\n\u22124\n\n\u22122\n\n0\n\nyW\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\nW+\nW\u2212\n\n1.00\n\nd \u03c3/d yW [nb]\n\nd \u03c3/d \u03b7l [nb]\n\n2\n\n1.25\n\n0.25\n\n0.75\n0.50\n0.25\n\n\u22126\n\n\u22124\n\n\u22122\n\n0\n\n\u03b7l\n\n2\n\n4\n\n1.25\n\n0.00\n\n6\n\n0.50\n\n\u22124\n\n\u22122\n\n0\n\nyW\n\n2\n\n4\n\n0.25\n\n6\n\nW+\nW\u2212\n\n1.00\n\nd \u03c3/d yW [nb]\n\n0.75\n\n\u22126\n\n1.25\n\nW+\nW\u2212\n\n1.00\n\nd \u03c3/d \u03b7l [nb]\n\n0\n\nyW\n\n0.75\n\n0.00\n\n6\n\nW+\nW\u2212\n\n1.00\n\n0.75\n0.50\n0.25\n\n\u22126\n\n\u22124\n\n\u22122\n\n0\n\n\u03b7l\n\n2\n\n4\n\n1.25\n\n0.00\n\n6\n\nm\n\n0.50\n\nk\n\u22126\n\nn\n\u22124\n\n\u22122\n\n0\n\n\u03b7l\n\n2\n\n4\n\n\u22124\n\n\u22122\n\n0\n\nyW\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\nW+\nW\u2212\n\n1.00\n\nd \u03c3/d yW [nb]\n\nl\n\n0.75\n\n\u22126\n\n1.25\n\nW+\nW\u2212\n\n1.00\n\nd \u03c3/d \u03b7l [nb]\n\n\u22122\n\n0.25\n\n1.25\n\n0.00\n\n\u22124\n\n1.00\n\n0.25\n\n0.25\n\n\u22126\n\n1.25\n\nd \u03c3/d yW [nb]\n\nd \u03c3/d \u03b7l [nb]\n\n0.75\n\n0.00\n\n0.50\n\n0.00\n\n6\n\nW+\nW\u2212\n\n1.00\n\n0.00\n\n0.75\n\n0.25\n\n1.25\n\n0.00\n\nW+\nW\u2212\n\n1.00\n\nd \u03c3/d yW [nb]\n\nd \u03c3/d \u03b7l [nb]\n\n1.00\n\np p, yW in bins of \u03b7l\n\n1.25\n\nW+\n\u2212\n\n111\n\n0.75\n0.50\n0.25\n\n6\n\n0.00\n\n\u22126\n\n\u22124\n\n\u22122\n\n0\n\nyW\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\nFigure 4.20: W boson rapidity distributions in bins of the charged lepton pseudo-rapidity (left) and vice versa (right)\nin the case of p p\u0304 collisions.

Here in p p\ncollisions, the absence of anti-quarks of valence will open the door to the previous asymmetries to fully\nexpress themselves and create important asymmetries between the positive and negative kinematics,\nespecially in the final state.\nFirst of all, before looking at the W boson and charged leptons kinematics in specific domain of\nthe phase-space we quantify the global charge asymmetry at the inclusive level due to the fact that\nin overall we produce more W + than W \u2212 .

We observe\nmW + \u2212 mW \u2212 \u223c O(10 MeV). Let us emphasise this behaviour is already present at LO. We explain\nthis effect heuristically with the following idea. In the quark\u2013anti-quark collision the more energy is\nbrought, the more the mass of the W can take its share for its mass mW . The cases which fall under\nthis category are the one involving a valence u quark, for a W + , and a valence d quark for a W \u2212 .\nSince in general u quarks carry more longitudinal momentum than the d quarks it turns out they\nhave more opportunities to participate to the production of a high mass W . Hence, eventually, at\nthe hadronic level W + are produced with higher masses with respect to the W \u2212 .\n\nd \u03c3/d mW [nb/GeV]\n\np p, W invariant mass\nW+\nW\u2212\n\n6.0\n5.0\n4.0\n3.0\n2.0\n1.0\n\nAsym(+,\u2212)(mW )\n\n0.0\n0.16\n0.15\n0.14\n0.13\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\nmW [GeV]\n\n90\n\n100\n\nFigure 4.22: Invariant mass of the W boson in p p collisions.\nFigure 4.23 shows now the kinematics of the W bosons and of the charged leptons.

The charge asymmetries in pT,W comes from the difference in the production of\nthe W + and W \u2212 . Because of the important implications in terms of systematic errors in the study of\nMW + \u2212 MW \u2212 this specific topic was discussed in the core of the Chapter (cf. \u00a7 4.2). Turning now to\nthe charged lepton kinematics we observe that the pseudo-rapidity distribution follows roughly the\npattern of the rapidity with the particular feature that the l\u2212 tends to decay in the direction of the\nW momentum direction while it is the inverse behaviour for the l+ . This pattern will be detailed\nfurther while looking at the \u03b7l distributions in yW bins, at this stage we can already understand that\nthe excess of matter in p p collisions implies\nq\u0304 < q\n\n\u21d2\n\nW (\u03bb = +1) < W (\u03bb = \u22121).\n\n(4.18)\n\nTo the light of the known behaviour of the charged lepton in their decay under the constrain of the V \u2212\nA coupling in EW interactions, this explains respectively the narrowing and flattening of the \u03b7l+ and\n\u2217 distributions.\n\u03b7l\u2212 distributions. This can be seen more directly in Fig. 4.25.(a) looking at the cos \u03b8W,l\nTo the purely sea pattern seen in Fig. 4.13.(a), we add up the \"valence\" terms but consider for\n(v) (s)\n(v) (s)\nsimplicity in the discussion only the main term up d \u0304p |Vud |2 for the W + and dp \u016bp |Vud |2 for the\n(v)\n(s)\nW \u2212 . Events such as up \u2212\u2192\u2190 d \u0304p give W + (\u03bb = \u22121) bosons from which the l+ leptons decay\npreferentially in the opposite direction of p~W + materialising eventually as o in the Figure. For W \u2212\n(v)\n(s)\nbosons, this time dp \u2212\u2192\u2190 up create W \u2212 (\u03bb = \u22121) bosons from which the l\u2212 leptons decay most\n\n\f4.A Detailed description of W in Drell\u2013Yan for pp\u0304, p p and d d collisions\n\n115\n\nof the time in the direction of p~W \u2212 . Eventually the inequality in the gaps \" o \u2212 r \" > \" q \u2212 p \"\nis explained once again by d < u, i.e. from the common pattern of the purely sea contribution the\npredominance of u quarks in the collision adds up a larger asymmetry in W + relatively to the one\nfor W \u2212 .\nComing back to the charged lepton kinematics the transverse momentum of the charged lepton\nshows very important charge asymmetries. The sources for those are : (1) mW + > mW \u2212 , (2) pT,W + 6=\npT,W \u2212 and (3) the non isotropic azimuthal decay of the charged leptons with respect to the direction\nof pT,W feature which has been already discussed in the case of p p\u0304 collisions. The first source cannot\nbe the one responsible for the size of these effects. Figure 4.24 proves it by showing Asym(+,\u2212) (pT,l )\nat LO where mW + > mW \u2212 is already present while (2) and (3) are not, and at the improved LO\nwhere all three effects are present.\n\nAsym(+,\u2212) (pT,l ) , LO vs. improved LO\n\nAsym(+,\u2212)(pT,l )\n\n0.25\n\nApp\nLO\nImproved LO\n\n0.20\n\n0.15\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\npT,l [GeV]\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\nFigure 4.24: Final state charge asymmetry at the leading order and improved leading order.\nThe reason for these large asymmetries in the pT,l distributions is explained by the predisposition\nof the l+ leptons to decay preferentially in the direction of pT,W while it is the over way around\n\u2217\ndistribution. The\nfor the l\u2212 leptons. This can be seen directly in Fig. 4.25.(b) showing the \u03c6W,l\nexplanations of this effect can be followed looking at Fig. 4.19, where this time the total absence\nof the (b) contribution involving valence anti-quarks open the door to effects (a) to fully express\ntheir charge dependent discrepancies. We start by addressing the case of the W + through the main\n(v)\n(s)\n\"valence\" term up \u2212\u2192\u2190 d \u0304p where, the higher transverse motion held by the d \u0304 forces the l+ to\n\u2217\n\u2212 is identical but this time the\ndecay most of the time so that \u03c6W\n+ ,l+ \u2248 0. The case of the W\nopposite helicity of the l\u2212 makes it so it decays preferentially in the opposite direction of p~T,W , i.e.\n\u2217\n\u03c6W\n\u2212 ,l\u2212 \u2248 \u03c0. Once again the relative size of the \" s \u2212 u \" and \" t \u2212 v \" gaps is justified by d < u.\nFigure 4.26.(left) allows now to see the difference in the behaviour of the decaying leptons in bins\nof yW through their pseudo-rapidity. Just like in p p\u0304 collisions the asymmetry due to the \"valence\"\ncontributions is almost negligible in the central narrow yW selection and then rise with the rapidity\nexcept that this time the asymmetries are not matched between W + and W \u2212 when summing the two\nopposite yW slices contributions but rather magnified. In the case of 3.5 < |yW | < 4.5, the excess of\nW + (\u03bb = \u22121) is such that in average most of the l+ leptons decay in the opposite direction of p~W as\nshown by the bumps in x and y . On the other hand the l\u2212 , due to the excess of W \u2212 (\u03bb = \u22121),\nfollow the W bosons momentum direction as displayed by the w and z bumps.\nThis large influence of the valence quarks in the high rapidity region suggests that for a measurement of MW + \u2212 MW \u2212 , selecting charged leptons emitted from low W rapidity would at least allow\nto reduce the systematics uncertainties related to the valence or sea quarks. By going to the narrow\nregion |\u03b7l < |0.5 one can see the size of the \"valence\" contamination in this region is non negligible.\n\n\u2022\n\n\fPhenomenology of W+ and W\u2212 in Drell\u2013Yan like processes at the LHC\n\n\u2217\nd \u03c3/d cos \u03b8W,l\n[nb]\n\n20\n\no\n\n\u2217\n(a) \u2212 p p, cos \u03b8W,l\n\nW+\nW\u2212\n\n15\n\n7.5\n\nq\n\n10\n\nr\n\np\n\n\u2217\n(b) \u2212 p p, \u03c6W,l\n\n8.0\n\u2217\nd \u03c3/d \u03c6W,l\n[nb]\n\n116\n\ns\n\n7.0\n\nW+\nW\u2212\n\n6.5\n\nu\n\n6.0\n5.5\n5.0\n4.5\n\n5\n\nv\n\nt\n\n4.0\n\n0.50\n\n\u2217\nAsym(+,\u2212)(\u03c6W,l\n)\n\n\u2217\nAsym(+,\u2212)(cos \u03b8W,l\n)\n\n\u2022\n\n0.25\n0.00\n\u22120.25\n\n\u22120.50\n\u22121.00 \u22120.75 \u22120.50 \u22120.25\n\n0.00\n\n\u2217\ncos \u03b8W,l\n\n0.25\n\n0.50\n\n0.75\n\n1.00\n\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n0.00 0.25 0.50 0.75 1.00 1.25 1.50 1.75 2.00 2.25 2.50 2.75 3.00\n\u2217\n\u03c6W,l\n[rad]\n\n\u2217\n\u2217\nFigure 4.25: Distributions of cos \u03b8W,l\n(a) and \u03c6W,l\n(b) in p p collisions.\n\nThis is the reason why in the core of the Chapter the narrow selection was made rather to |\u03b7l | < 0.3\nsince it was found to be the best compromise for a realistic measurement prospect in Chapter 5.\nFigure 4.27 shows the size of the initial state charge asymmetries by looking at the transverse\nmomentum of the W boson.

collisions\n\n4.A.5\n\n121\n\nDeuteron\u2013deuteron collisions\n\nHere, the overall charge asymmetry based on the inclusive cross sections from Table 4.1 gives\nAd d \u2248 0.0015.\n\n(4.19)\n\nThe predictions for d d collisions can be understood from the previous study of p p collisions.\nIndeed, here the novelty is that reaching the equality u(v) = d(v) allows to cancel out the most\nimportant differences between the W + and W \u2212 at the level of the production.\nThe invariant masses of the W + and W \u2212 in Fig. 4.30 are now superimposed up to the very small\nAd d offset. Hence here the W + and W \u2212 masses occur with almost the same probabilities, we find\nmW + \u2212 mW \u2212 \u223c O(0.1 MeV).\nd \u03c3/d mW [nb/GeV]\n\nd d, W invariant mass\nW+\nW\u2212\n\n10.0\n8.0\n6.0\n4.0\n2.0\n\nAsym(+,\u2212)(mW )\n\n0.0\n0.005\n0.000\n\u22120.005\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\nmW [GeV]\n\n90\n\nFigure 4.30: Invariant mass of the W boson in d d collisions with\n\n100\n\np\nSn1 n2 = 7 TeV.\n\nConcerning the main kinematics yW , pT,W , \u03b7l and pT,l shown in Fig. 4.31 the most striking\nfeature is the gain of charge symmetry in the initial state with respect to p p collisions. Because now\nthe production of the W + and W \u2212 is almost the same in proportions the rapidity and transverse\nmomentum distributions almost perfectly match each other. On the other hand in the final state the\nV \u2212 A effect folded to the issues related to the transverse motion of the W gives unchanged features\nsuch as : (1) the flattening of the \u03b7l\u2212 and narrowing of the \u03b7l+ distributions with respect to yW and\n(2) the privileged decay of the l+ (l\u2212 ) in the same(opposite) direction of p~T,W . These two effects can\n\u2217\n\u2217 in Fig. 4.25.\nand \u03c6W,l\nbe seen respectively more directly from the angular point of view with cos \u03b8W,l\nLet us note as well the size of Asym(+,\u2212) (pT,l ) which is different from p p collisions. This is due\nto the energy\nin the collision which, being lower here, gives more importance to the valence quarks\n\u221a\nwhile at S = 14 TeV the latter are\n\u221a drowned in the large purely sea contributions. This variation of\n(+,\u2212)\nAsym\n(pT,l ) as a function of S is treated in the next sub-section.\nFigure 4.33 shows the \u03b7l distributions in bins of yW and vice versa. Note the charged leptons\nbehaviour are the same than in p p collisions but now the proportions of W + and W \u2212 are the same,\nwhich is particularly noticeable in the last two lines where the positive and negative \u03b7l -pieces of the\nplots do not interpenetrate each other. Figure 4.34 shows the transverse momentum of the W in bins\nof yW and \u03b7l . As can be seen, even if here the discrepancies are induced by the s, c and b flavours\nsince they are weighted by the valence quarks (Eq. (4.3)) it is in the forward rapidity region they are\nthe most important.

p and d d collisions\n\n4.A.6\n\n127\n\nTransverse momentum of the (anti-)quarks for W in Drell\u2013Yan\n\nThis sub-section presents more explanations on the transverse momenta unbalance between the valence quark and the sea anti-quark.\nIn most cases the valence quarks brings most of the energy in the collision. These q (v) q\u0304 0 (s)\nconfigurations with high xq for the valence quark and low xq\u03040 for the sea anti-quark are already well\nknow. Now the thing is that a parton with a small x will have in general a higher transverse motion\ngained on its way to the collision by radiating gluons and photons (note also the low x (anti-)quark\ncan be as well the product of the radiation of a gluon via g \u2192 q 0 q\u0304 0 ).\nFinally because of the CKM missing angles the other flavours such as s\u0304, c\u0304 and b\u0304 have their\ntransverse motion influenced as well. To emphasise this aspect let us note that in the case of the\nproduction of Z bosons since the previous flavours create Z bosons only via s s\u0304, c c\u0304, b b\u0304 annihilation\nwe observe pT,q = pT,q\u0304 in those specific cases (we used for that the generator WINHAC which as said\nearlier can produce Z bosons, cf. \u00a7 3.1.2).\nThe previous ideas are illustrated in Fig. 4.37 with the histograms of the inclusive transverse\nmomenta of the u and d \u0304 flavours in the W + production (a) and the one of the d and \u016b flavours in\nthe W \u2212 production (b). In both cases the sea quark show larger probability to hold a high pT while\nthe valence quark hold a low pT . These histograms were obtained, like the others, for a statistic of\n200 millions of weighted events.\n(a) \u2212 pT of u and d \u0304 quarks in W + production\npT,u\npT,d \u0304\n\n2.0\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n0\n\npT,d\npT,\u016b\n\n2.5\nd \u03c3/d pT [nb/GeV]\n\n2.5\nd \u03c3/d pT [nb/GeV]\n\n(b) \u2212 pT of d and \u016b quarks in W \u2212 production\n\n2.0\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n\n5\n\n10\npT [GeV]\n\n15\n\n20\n\n0.0\n0\n\n5\n\n10\npT [GeV]\n\n15\n\n20\n\nFigure 4.37: Transverse momenta of the u and d \u0304 quarks in W + production (a) along with the one of the d and \u016b\nquarks in W \u2212 production (b).\nThe corresponding estimation of the average pT of the u, \u016b and d, d \u0304 quarks are\nhpT,u i \u2248 7.05 GeV,\nhpT,d i \u2248 7.65 GeV,\n\npT,d \u0304 \u2248 12.58 GeV\n\nhpT,\u016b i \u2248 11.77 GeV\n\nin W + production\n\n(4.20)\n\nin\n\n(4.21)\n\nW\u2212\n\nproduction\n\nAnyhow in the previous values u(s) and d(s) values intervene, to factorise in a better way the\nasymmetries induced by the cases where there is a valence quark involved in the collisions we repeat\nthe previous study putting to zero the sea contributions u(s) and d(s) , in that context, the average pT\nof the quarks in q (v) q\u0304 0 (s) \"valence\" contributions for W + production of\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\np\n\u2248 14.91 GeV\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 T,d \u0304\nD\nE\npT,u(v) \u2248 4.99 GeV \u2190\u2192\n(4.22)\nhpT,s\u0304 i \u2248 15.77 GeV ,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 p\n\u2248 21.97 GeV\nT,b\u0304\n\n\u2022\n\n\f\u2022\n\n128\n\nPhenomenology of W+ and W\u2212 in Drell\u2013Yan like processes at the LHC\n\nand for d(v) q\u0304 0 (s) \"valence\" contributions in W \u2212 production of\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 hp i \u2248 14.64 GeV\nD\nE\nT,\u016b\npT,d(v) \u2248 5.03 GeV \u2190\u2192\n\uf8f3 hp i \u2248 16.88 GeV\n\n(4.23)\n\nT,c\u0304\n\nIn both cases we observe that the valence quark holds a very low transverse motion with respect to\nthe anti-quark. Note also that the transverse motion of the sea anti-quark increases with the mass of\nthe quark.\nNow these average pT of the quarks for purely sea contribution are :\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4 pT,d \u0304 \u2248 9.04 GeV\n\uf8f2\nD\nE\npT,u(s) \u2248 9.87 GeV \u2190\u2192\n(4.24)\nhpT,s\u0304 i \u2248 10.71 GeV\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 p\nT,b\u0304 \u2248 16.19 GeV\nD\nE\nfor the W + production. Because u(s) < d(s) for 10\u22124 < x we observe pT,u(s) > pT,d \u0304 while it was\nthe other way around for \"valence\" contributions. Also let us remark again that the higher the mass\nof a quark is the higher its transverse motion is. In the case of the W \u2212 production we have\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 hp i \u2248 9.97 GeV\nE\nD\nT,\u016b\n(4.25)\npT,d(s) \u2248 9.29 GeV \u2190\u2192\n\uf8f3 hp i \u2248 12.69 GeV\nT,c\u0304\n\nLet us remark that averaging the \"valence\" and purely sea contributions does not give exactly the\nvalues estimated when taking all contributions. This can be explained by the fact the proton's\nintegrity cannot be exactly factorised into \"valence\" and purely sea contributions.\n\n4.A.7\n\nAmplitude of the final state charge asymmetries in function of the energy\nin the collision\n\nAs observed in the study of deuteron\u2013deuteron collisions the final state charge asymmetries in the\nobservable pT,l is larger than for the case of proton\u2013proton collisions. The energy in the collision is the\nparameter responsible\nfor those effects. To see how this works we\u221astudy Asym(+,\u2212) (pT,l ) as a function\n\u221a\nof the energy S in the center of mass frame (Fig. 4.38.(a)). As S increases we witness the decrease\nof the charge asymmetry. Knowing the charge asymmetry comes from \"valence\" contributions as the\nenergy rise the charge symmetric purely sea contributions increases and we end up with a lower and\nlower proportion of asymmetry due to \"valence\" terms.\n\u221a Nonetheless, the asymmetry in the quarks\n(v) q\u0304 0 (s) increases with\npT for \"valence\" contributions\nq\nS. We find for example in the two extreme\n\u221a\ncases and the nominal S = 14 TeV collision mode :\nD\nE\n\u221a\nfor S = 2 TeV\n:\npT,u(v) \u2248 4.73 GeV \u2190\u2192 pT,d \u0304 \u2248 8.43 GeV\n(4.26)\nD\nE\n\u221a\nfor S = 14 TeV\n:\npT,u(v) \u2248 4.99 GeV \u2190\u2192 pT,d \u0304 \u2248 15.77 GeV\n(4.27)\nD\nE\n\u221a\nfor S = 20 TeV\n:\npT,u(v) \u2248 4.99 GeV \u2190\u2192 pT,d \u0304 \u2248 15.90 GeV\n(4.28)\n\n\u221a\nTo emphasise the increase of the asymmetry in absolute as S grows we look at the bare difference\nof the positively and negatively charged histograms. This is shown in Fig. 4.38.(b), the purely\nsea contributions giving exactly the same contributions we are left with the difference between the\n\"valence\" terms only.\nAnyhow, the important idea here is to understand that the energy in the collision which is lower in\nthe hypothetical case of d d collisions runs at the LHC forces us to deal with larger charge asymmetries\nwith respect to the seen in p p collisions runs. This will explain the different behaviour of the\nsystematic analysis prospect between d d and p p collisions in the next and final Chapter.\n\n\f4.A Detailed description of W in Drell\u2013Yan for pp\u0304, p p and d d collisions\n\n(a) \u2212 Asym(+,\u2212)(pT,l ;\n0.50\n\n\u221a\n\n0.40\n\nAsym(+,\u2212)(pT,l ;\n\n\u221a\n\nS)\n\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\n\u221a\n\n129\n\nS) in p p collisions\n\nS = 2 TeV\nS = 5 TeV\nS = 10 TeV\nS = 14 TeV\nS = 20 TeV\n\n0.30\n\n0.20\n\n0.10\n20\n\n30\n\n40\npT,l [GeV]\n\n50\n\n60\n\n\u221a\n(d \u03c3 +/d pT,l + \u2212 d \u03c3 \u2212/d pT,l \u2212 ) ( S) [nb]\n\n\u221a\n(b) \u2212 (d \u03c3 +/d pT,l + \u2212 d \u03c3 \u2212/d pT,l \u2212 ) ( S) in p p collisions\n\u221a\n\n0.25\n\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\n0.20\n\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\nS = 2 TeV\nS = 5 TeV\nS = 10 TeV\nS = 14 TeV\nS = 20 TeV\n\n0.15\n0.10\n0.05\n0.00\n20\n\n30\n\n40\npT,l [GeV]\n\n50\n\n60\n\nFigure 4.38: Charge asymmetry\n(a) and bare difference (b) of the transverse momenta distributions of the charged\n\u221a\nleptons for several values of\n\nS.\n\n\u2022\n\n\f\u2022\n\n130\n\nPhenomenology of W+ and W\u2212 in Drell\u2013Yan like processes at the LHC\n\n\fChapter 5\n\nStrategy for a reduction of the\nsystematic errors on MW+ \u2212 MW\u2212\n\"But then . . . \" I venture to remark, \"you are still far from the solution. . . . \"\n\"I am very close to one,\" William said, \"but I don't know which.\"\n\"Therefore you don't have a single answer to your questions ?\"\n\"Adso, if I did I would teach theology in Paris.\"\n\"In Paris do they always have the true answer ?\"\n\"Never,\" William said, \"but they are very sure of their errors.\"\nThe Name of the Rose\nUmberto Ecco\n\nHere we finally present the dedicated strategies that were devised \u2013based on the knowledge built\nthroughout Chapter 4\u2013 to prepare a measurement of MW + \u2212MW \u2212 at the LHC. As already mentioned\nin the first Chapter while at the Tevatron the statistical and systematic errors where of the same\norder at the LHC the first one will drop to \u2248 5 MeV for just one year of harvesting data at low\nluminosity. On the other hand the systematic error will be still important and we show how using\nthe LHC and ATLAS detector capabilities we could eventually decrease those systematic errors and\nthus enhance by a factor 20 the actual precision on MW + \u2212 MW \u2212 . The most important results below\nwere presented in Ref. [146].\nThe Chapter is divided as follow. The first Section presents the strategies and observables developed in our collaboration which, according to us, should be more robust to address this particular\nmeasurement at the LHC. Following that a presentation of the general context for studying W in\nDrell\u2013Yan is briefly reminded. The second Section describes the principle of the analysis to extract\nthe mass parameter for both the classic and the new suggested methods. The third Section addresses\nthe sources of theoretical and experimental systematic errors that should be taken into account in\nthe estimation of the error on this measurement. Finally in the last Section our strategies robustness\nwith respect to both theoretical and apparatus unknowns addressed in our analysis are improved on\nthe example of the simulation of one year of data taking at low luminosity.\n\n5.1\n5.1.1\n\nMeasurement strategies\nEvent selection\n\nAs mentioned earlier the extraction of the W and Z bosons properties is achieved by studying their\nelectronic and muonic decays, that is respectively W \u2192 l \u03bdl and Z \u2192 l+ l\u2212 . The choice for leptonic\ndecays is motivated by the fact the di-jet background is of several orders of magnitude more important\nthan the W \u2192 q q\u0304 0 and Z \u2192 q q\u0304 signals we would be interested in while the leptonic decays provide\nclean processes (i.e. absence of QCD in the final state) with large cross sections. The decays to the\n\n\f132\n\nStrategy for a reduction of the systematic errors on MW+ \u2212 MW\u2212\n\ntau channel is not considered though because the mass of the charged \u03c4 is such that it decays within\n\u2248 300 \u00d7 10\u221215 s, which leads to at least two neutrinos to deal with for the detection of the final state.\nThe particular study of the W + and W \u2212 bosons is made by splitting the data collected for the\nW bosons into positively and negatively charged leptons in the final state to get the corresponding\nW + and W \u2212 data. The main criteria used in hadronic collider to study W bosons are to have a\nhigh energy charged lepton in the high precision detector volume of the detector associated with\nhigh transverse missing energy E\n/ T that betrays the presence of the neutrino. Also, to reduce the\nbackground, rejection are made using constraints on the recoil ~u defined as the sum of all momenta\nrecoiling against the W system\n(5.1)\n\n~u \u2261 \u2212~\npW ,\n\n= \u2212~\npl \u2212 p/~\u03bdl ,\n\n(5.2)\n\nbut again, due to the non possibility to measure the longitudinal component of the particles escaping\nthe beam-pipe, its transverse component uT is considered instead.\nFrom the total number of events produced inclusively (Eq. (2.5)) now must be taken into account\nthe effects of the acceptance selection, the reconstruction efficiency and the background processes\nwhose kinematics can lure the trigger to recognise them as lepton pair decaying from single W .\n(candidates)\nTaking that into account, eventually the number of W candidates NW\nfrom Drell\u2013Yan are\n(candidates)\n\nNW\n\n(acc.)\n\n\u2261 NW\n\n(bckg.)\n\n+ NW\n\n(acc.)\n\n(bckg.)\n\nwhere NW\nis the number of accepted W events by the cuts and NW\n(acc.)\nevents. The expression of NW\nreads\n(acc.)\n\nNW\n\n(cut)\n\n= L \u03c3W\n\n(5.3)\n\n,\n\nis the number of background\n\n\u03b5,\n\n(5.4)\n\n(cut)\n\nwhere L the integrated luminosity, \u03c3W the cross section that the W \u2192 l\u03bdl events fulfill the selection\nrequirements and \u03b5 is the efficiency reconstruction for the signal in the given fiducial region. The\nnumber of background events can be expressed like\n(bckg.)\n\nNW\n\n(cut)\n\n= L \u03c3W bckg. \u03b5 + B,\n\n(5.5)\n\n(cut)\n\nwhere \u03c3W bckg. is the cut cross section of all the processes that displays kinematics in their final state\nthat mimic the features of the final state leptons from Drell\u2013Yan W and B is the contribution term\ndue to the electronic noise, the cavern background, etc. Below, more details on these criteria are\ngiven for the case of CDF, ATLAS and finally for our stand-alone analysis prospect.\nEvent selection in CDF. In CDF II [51] a Drell\u2013Yan W is recognised by having at least one\nlepton candidate in the central region (|\u03b7l | . 1) and by applying the following narrowing selection on\nthe kinematics :\n- The charged lepton pT must verify : 30 GeV < pT,l < 55 GeV.\n- The neutrino pT , deduced from the measurement of E\n/ T , must verify : 30 GeV < p\n/T,\u03bdl < 55 GeV.\n- The leptons transverse mass must verify : 60 GeV < mT, l \u03bdl < 100 GeV\n- The transverse recoil must verify : uT < 15 GeV.\nAdditional cuts are made to reject background from Z leptonic decays. Eventually the measurement\nof the W properties in Ref. [51] based on these selection criteria provided \u2248 50, 000 candidates events\nfor W \u2192 \u03bc \u03bd\u03bc (L \u2248 191 pb\u22121 ) and \u2248 64, 000 candidates events for W \u2192 e \u03bde (L \u2248 220 pb\u22121 ).\n\n\f5.1 Measurement strategies\n\n133\n\nExpected event selection in ATLAS. In ATLAS, although no data is there yet to confirm which\ncriteria would fit the best the LHC context the adopted requirements taken from Ref. [71] are :\n- Have a charged muon or isolated electron with pT,l > 20 GeV in the precision physics acceptance\nvolume (|\u03b7l | < 2.5).\n- Have a missing transverse energy of E\n/ T > 20 GeV.\n- No jets in the event with pT > 30 GeV to reject backgrounds from jets and tt\u0304 events.\n- A recoil uT < 50 GeV to avoid to much the influence of the pT,W smearing on the leptons.\nobservables\nIn ATLAS, these constraints should be such that from the \u2248 350 millions of W bosons produced for\nan integrated luminosity of L = 10 fb\u22121 only 60 millions should be accepted (no matter the charge or\nthe decay channel).\nEvent selection for the present study. The W boson production events used in our studies\nare selected by requiring that the simulated decaying charged electron or muon satisfy the following\nrequirements :\npT,l > 20 GeV and |\u03b7l | < 2.5.\n(5.6)\n\nWe assume that by using a suitable E\n/ T cut the impact of the uncertainty in the background contribution on the measurement of the charge asymmetry of the W boson mass at the LHC can be made\nnegligible. This allows us to skip the generation and simulation of the background event samples\nfor our studies. It has to be stressed that the above assumption is weaker for the measurement of\nthe charge asymmetry than for the measurement of the average W boson mass [57, 58] because, to\na good approximation, only the difference of the background for the positive and negative lepton\nsamples will bias the measurement. The presentation of the results of our studies is largely simplified\nby noticing that they are insensitive to the presence of the E\n/ T cut in the signal samples. Therefore,\nthe results are based on selection of events purely on the basis of the reconstructed charged lepton\nkinematics variables as shown in Eq. (5.6). Studies have shown that these results will remain valid\nwhatever E\n/ T cut will be used at the LHC to diminish the impact of the background contamination\nat the required level of precision. To be more precise, in our simple model this E\n/ T cut was emulated\nby a direct p/T,\u03bdl cut. Nonetheless, in the specific purpose of a cut, this approximation is believed to\nbe fully justified.\nThe detector response is based on the ATLAS tracker which, for reminder, was emulated using\nGaussian resolutions for pT and cotan \u03b8 of the charged electron and muons according to Eqs. (2.15\u2013\n2.16).\nConcerning the statistic, in absence of background and imperfect reconstruction efficiencies, we\nsimply have\n(acc.)\n(cut)\nNW\n= L \u03c3W .\n(5.7)\nThe cut cross section corresponding to the requirements of Eq. (5.6) and for the expected LHC\nenergies for p p (Eq. (2.11)) and d d (Eq. (2.12)) collisions are compiled in Table 5.1. Table 5.2\ngives the correspondence in terms of number of events obtained by using the respective integrated\nluminosities for p p and d d collisions (Eqs. (2.11\u20132.12)) in Eq. (5.7).\n\n5.1.2\n\nObservables\n\nThe values of the W + and W \u2212 boson masses can be unfolded from the measured lepton charge\ndistributions pT,l , p/T,\u03bdl and from the transverse mass mT, l \u03bdl .

However, for the measurement of the charge asymmetry of the masses\nthis is no longer the case because QCD radiation \u2013which drives the shape of the pT,W distribution\u2013\nis independent of the charge of the produced W boson. In our view the pT,l based methods will be\nsuperior with respect to the mT, l \u03bdl based ones, in particular for the first measurements of the W\nmass charge asymmetries at the LHC.\n(a)\n\nCommonly used observables\n\nIn the context of a pT,l based method for the extraction of MW + \u2212 MW \u2212 , the most natural method\nis to analyse separately the l+ and l\u2212 event samples and determine independently the masses of the\nW + and W \u2212 bosons. This method, that will be investigated, is based on independent measurements\nof the d \u03c3/d pT,l+ and d \u03c3/d pT,l\u2212 distributions. It will be called hereafter the classic method and\nactually corresponds to what physicists did at with the CDF detector to provide measurements of\nMW + \u2212 MW \u2212 .\n(b)\n\nThe charge asymmetry\n\nA new method proposed and evaluated in our collaboration is based on the measurement of the\ncharge asymmetry (Eq. (1.7)) of the pT,l distribution. This method will be called hereafter the charge\nasymmetry method. The distribution of Asym(+,\u2212) (pT,l ) is, by definition, robust with respect to those\nof systematic measurement effects and those of model dependent effects that are independent of the\nlepton charge. The acceptance, and the lepton selection efficiency corrections for this observable\nwill, in the leading order approximation, reflect only their lepton charge dependent asymmetries.\nIn addition, the Asym(+,\u2212) (pT,l ) observable is expected to be robust with respect to the modeling\nuncertainty of the QCD and QED radiation processes.\nIf extrapolated from the experience gained at the Tevatron (cf. Appendix 2.A), the precision of the\ncharge asymmetry method will be limited by the understanding of relative biases in the reconstructed\ntransverse momenta for positively and negatively charged particles (cf. \u00a7 2.4). These biases, contrary\nto the lepton charge averaged biases, cannot be controlled using the J/\u03c8, \u03a5 and Z \"standard candles\"\nthat helps only to correct for the absolute energy scale. This problem leads us to the third and final\nobservable for our study : the double charge asymmetry.\n\n\f5.1 Measurement strategies\n(c)\n\n135\n\nThe double charge asymmetry\n\nThe double charge asymmetry is defined like\nDAsym(+,\u2212) (\u03c1T,l ) \u2261\n\ni\n1h\n(+,\u2212)\n(+,\u2212)\nAsym ~\n(\u03c1T,l ) + Asym ~\n(\u03c1T,l ) ,\nB=B ~ez\nB=\u2212B ~ez\n2\n\n(5.8)\n\nwhere the variable \u03c1T,l defined like \u03c1T,l \u2261 1/pT,l (cf. \u00a7 1.3), represents the radius of the track curvature\nat the W boson production vertex in the plane r \u2212 \u03c6 perpendicular to the beam collision axis and\nB is the strength of the solenoidal magnetic field bathing the inner tracker. The choice on \u03c1T,l was\ncast to follow the notation adopted in our former work [145]. The measurement method using the\nDAsym(+,\u2212) (\u03c1T,l ) distribution will be called hereafter the double charge asymmetry method.\nThe DAsym(+,\u2212) (\u03c1T,l ) distribution is expected to be robust with respect to the charge dependent\ntrack measurement biases if the following two conditions are fulfilled : (1) the inversion of the zcomponent of the magnetic field in the tracker volume can be controlled to a requisite precision and\n~ \u00d7B\n~ Lorentz drift relative corrections to the reconstructed hit positions for the two magnetic\n(2) the E\nfield configurations, in the silicon tracker could be determined to a requisite precision. Discussing\nthese two conditions in details is beyond the scope of this work. Nonetheless the second point, in\nview of the ATLAS detector design was considered qualitatively in our work [111] with regard to the\nspecificity of the pixel, SCT and TRT barrel modules.\nFirst, the inversion of the magnetic field should a priori have no influence on the TRT intrinsic\ncapabilities since the measurement of the hit is based solely on the time it takes for electrons to drift\nto the center wire as shown in Fig. 2.18.(b). Then, reverting the magnetic field should reverse the drift\npaths of the electron but not affect the drift time. Concerning the SCT barrel modules the tilt angle\nfor the invert magnetic field configuration is now worsening the nominal hit resolution as depicted in\nFig. 5.1. In the best case scenario the Lorentz drift angle made by the drifting electrons is well under\ncontrol and the resolution of the SCT for the inverted magnetic field should be well accounted. If that\nwould not be the case then the resolution of the SCT modules will change. Nonetheless the double\nlayer feature of silicon wafers, by providing an average offline hit position, should help to tackle such\nproblems. This is no longer the case for the pixel detector whose modules posses only one layer.

Here, to each event, looking at the origins of the other particles\ntracks should help for a possible correction of the production vertex of the W leptonic decay.\n\n\f136\n\nStrategy for a reduction of the systematic errors on MW+ \u2212 MW\u2212\n\nTo conclude, in Fig. 5.2 we show the distributions of d \u03c3/d pT,l and Asym(+,\u2212) (pT,l ) for : (1) the\ngenerated and unselected sample of events, (2) the generated and selected sample of events and (3) the\nunbiased simulated detector response and selected sample of events. The corresponding histograms in\n\u03c1T,l -space can be in seen in Figs. 5.7.(a), (b) and (c) of Appendix 5.A.

It is obvious that, initially, the machine\nand the detector operation modes will be optimised for the above research program. The main target\npresented here is to evaluate the precision of the measurement of the W mass charge asymmetry\nwhich is achievable in such a phase of the detector and machine operation.\nA natural extension of this work is to go further and investigate if, and to which extent, the\nprecision of measurement of the Standard Model parameters could be improved in dedicated machine\nand detector setting runs. In our first work [145] we discussed the role of : (1) dedicated runs with\nreduced beam collision energies, (2) dedicated runs with isoscalar beams and (3) runs with dedicated\ndetector magnetic field settings ; in optimising the use of the Z boson production processes as a\n\n\f5.2 The analysis method\n\n137\n\n\"standard candle\" for the W boson processes. Here some of these dedicate settings were found to be\nof interest but the most important ones were devised in the particular context of this measurement\nof MW + \u2212 MW \u2212 . More precisely, we discuss the possible improvement in the measurement precision\nof the charge asymmetry of the W boson mass which can be achieved (1) by replacing the proton\nbeams with light isoscalar\u2013ion beams and (2) by running the detector for a fraction of time with the\ninverse direction of the solenoidal magnetic field. These and other dedicated operation modes could\nbe tried in the advanced \"dedicated measurement phase\" of the LHC experimental program. Such\na phase, if ever happens, could start following the running period when the collected luminosity will\nbecome a linear function of the running time and the gains/cost ratio of its further increase will be\ncounterbalanced by the gains/cost ratio of running dedicated machine and detector operation modes.\n\n5.2\n\nThe analysis method\n\nIn this section we present the technical aspects of the analysis method used in the evaluation of the\nachievable precision of the measurement of the charge asymmetry of the W boson masses, MW + \u2212\nMW \u2212 , denoted sometimes for a matter of convenience \u2206(+,\u2212) .\nThe shapes of the experimental distribution (generator level \u2297 cuts \u2297 smearing) shown in Fig. 5.2\nare sensitive to : (1) the assumed values of MW + and MW + , (2) the values of the other parameters of\nthe Standard Model, (3) the modeling parameters of the W boson production processes and (4) the\nsystematic measurement biases. Our task is to evaluate the impact of the uncertainties of (2), (3)\nand (4) on the extracted values of MW + and MW \u2212 for each of the proposed measurement methods.\nIt is done using a likelihood analysis of the distributions for the pseudo-data (PD) event samples and\nthose for the mass template (MT ) event samples. Each PD sample represents a specific measurement\nor modeling bias, implemented respectively in the event simulation or event generation process. Each\nMT sample was generated by assuming a specific MW + (MW \u2212 ) value or a value of their charge\nasymmetry \u2206(+,\u2212) . The MT samples are simulated using the unbiased detector response and fixed\nvalues of all the parameters used in the modeling of the W boson production and decays except\nfor the mass parameters. The likelihood analysis, explained below in more detail, allows us : (1) to\nfind out which of the systematic measurement and modeling errors, could be falsely absorbed into\nthe measured value of the W boson masses and (2) to evaluate quantitatively the corresponding\nmeasurement biases.\n\n5.2.1\n\nLikelihood analysis\n\nLet us consider, as an example, the impact of a systematic effect \u03be on the bias in the measured\nvalue of the W + mass determined from the likelihood analysis of the d \u03c3/d pT,l+ distributions. Since\nsome of the upcoming results were carried based on \u03c1T,l observable as well we mention already the\ncorrespondence in terms of resolution and range.\nThe simulation of the pseudo-data event sample, PD, representing a given systematic bias \u03be, is\n(ref.)\ncarried out for a fixed value of the mass MW . Subsequently, a set of the 2 N + 1 unbiased (i.e.\n\u03be = 0) template data samples MT is simulated. Each sample n of the MT set corresponds to a\ngiven value of\n(n)\n\n(ref.)\n\nMW + = M W\n\n(n)\n\n+ \u03b4MW + ,\n\n(5.9)\n(ref.)\n\nwith n = {\u2212N , . . . , N } and where for the rest of the document MW = 80.403 GeV. The likelihood\nbetween the binned d \u03c3/d pT,l+ distributions for the nth. MT sample and the \u03be-dependent PD sample\nis quantified in terms of the \u03c72 value :\ntot.\nNbins\n\n\u03c7 (pT,l+ ; \u03be, n) =\n2\n\nX\ni\n\n(d \u03c3i; \u03be \u2212 d \u03c3i; \u03be=0,n )2\n\n(\u2206d \u03c3i; \u03be )2 + (\u2206d \u03c3i; \u03be=0,n )2\n\n,\n\n(5.10)\n\n\f138\n\nStrategy for a reduction of the systematic errors on MW+ \u2212 MW\u2212\n\nwhere d \u03c3i \u2261 d \u03c3i /d pT,l+ is the content of the ith. bin of the histogram entering in the analysis and\ntot. bins enters in the analysis, it represents the\n\u2206d \u03c3i is the corresponding statistical error. In total, Nbins\ntot. . The bulk of the results presented has been obtained using a bin\ndegrees of freedom (dof), dof \u2261 Nbins\nsize corresponding to \u03b4 pT,l = 200 MeV (respectively \u03b4 \u03c1T,l = 0.2 MeV\u22121 ) which is approximately the\nanticipated measurement resolution of the track curvature [96] and the summation range satisfying\nthe following condition for pT,l (\u03c1T,l )\n30 GeV < pT,l < 50 GeV\n\n(0.02 GeV\u22121 < \u03c1T,l < 0.03 GeV\u22121 ),\n\n(5.11)\n\nwhich corresponds to degrees of freedom of dof pT,l = 100 (dof \u03c1T,l = 49). This choice is justified as\nthe CDF II measurements were realised for the pT,l observable in the range 32 GeV < pT,l < 48 GeV\nto get rid as much of the background by focusing on the jacobian peak region.\n(n)\nThe \u03c72 (pT,l+ ; \u03be, n) dependence upon \u03b4MW + is fitted by a polynomial of second order. The position\nof the minimum, MW + (\u03be)min , of the fitted function determines the systematic mass shift \u2206MW + (\u03be) =\n(ref.)\nMW + (\u03be)min \u2212 MW + due to the systematic effect \u03be. If the systematic effect under study can be\nfully absorbed by a shifted value of W + , then the expectation value of \u03c72min /dof is \u2248 1 and the\nerror on the estimated value of the mass shift, \u03b4 (\u2206MW + (\u03be)), can be determined from the condition\n\u03c72 (MW + (\u03be)min + \u03b4 (\u2206MW + (\u03be))) \u2261 \u03c72min + 1 (see Ref. [1] for further details on this topic).\nOf course, not all the systematic and modeling effects can be absorbed into the variation of a single\nparameter, even if the likelihood is estimated in a narrow bin-range, purposely chosen to have the\nhighest sensitivity to the mass parameters. In such cases the value of \u03c72min /dof can be substantially\nlarger than 1, and \u03b4 (\u2206MW + (\u03be)) looses its statistical meaning. This can partially be recovered by\nintroducing additional degrees of freedom (the renormalisation of the PD samples, discussed later on\nin \u00a7 5.2.3, is an example of such a procedure). However, even in such a case the estimated value of\n\u03b4 (\u2206MW + (\u03be)) will remain slightly dependent upon the number of the 2 N + 1 MT samples, more\nprecisely their MW + spacing in the vicinity of the minimum and the functional form of the fit. Varying\nthese parameters in our analysis procedure in a \u03be-dependent manner would explode the PC farm CPU\ntime and was abandoned. Instead, we calibrated the propagation of statistical bin-by-bin errors into\nthe \u03b4 (\u2206MW + (\u03be)) error, and checked the biases of all the aspects of the above method using the\nstatistically independent \"PD-calibration samples\" in which, instead of varying the \u03be effects, we\nvaried the values of MW + .\n\n5.2.2\n(a)\n\nThe MT and PD event samples\n\nClassic method\n\nIn the classic method the bias of \u2206(+,\u2212) (\u03be) resulting from the systematic effects \u03be is determined in\nthe following three steps :\n1.

For the MT\nsamples, combining the event sample \u2212N and N produced shifts for the \u2206(+,\u2212) parameter as shown\nin the second column of Table 5.3. Even though the basics MT allowed us to spread the range of\nthe analysis to \u00b1400 MeV, most of the values for the systematic errors are such that it proved to be\nreasonable to stay in the \u00b1200 MeV range.\nIn preliminary studies the charge asymmetry method was first verified using two charge symmetric\n(ref.)\nprocedures. In the first one the variation of \u2206(+,\u2212) was made by fixing MW + = MW and by changing\nMW \u2212 . In the second one we inverted the role of MW + and MW \u2212 . The results obtained with these\ntwo charge symmetric methods were found to agree within the statistical errors.\nThe first measurement of the charge asymmetry of the W boson masses at the LHC will have\nto use, as the first iteration step, the best existing constraints on the W boson masses.

In top of saving CPU\ntime it allows as well to share the same data and then improve the safety in our analysis. For that\nreason the pseudo-data were also shared among all methods.\nThis procedure is illustrated in Fig. 5.4 for the case of the charge asymmetry method. The\nAsym(+,\u2212) (pT,l ) distribution is plotted in Fig. 5.4.(a) as a function of pT,l for three values \u2206(+,\u2212) .

It calibrates\nthe statistical precision of the measurement for the integrated luminosity of 10 fb\u22121 , and based on\nthe error obtained for the classic method in the rest of the Chapter we round all results to the MeV.\nOur goal will be to reduce the systematic biases in the measurement of \u2206(+,\u2212) with a comparable\nprecision than the statistical error.\n(c)\n\nDouble charge asymmetry method\n\nThe MT event samples for this methods are exactly the same as for the charge asymmetry method.\nThe PD event samples have been simulated in two steps corresponding to the two half-a-year periods\nof data taking corresponding to the two magnetic field configurations.\n\n5.2.3\n\nScaling distributions for quarks flavors systematics\n\nMost of systematic measurement and modeling biases discussed in this work lead to a distortion of\nthe distributions and do not change their overall normalisation. The notable exception, discussed in\nmore detail in the next section, are the biases driven by the PDFs uncertainties. These biases cannot\nbe \"absorbed\" by the corresponding \u2206(+,\u2212) (\u03be) shifts and require an adjustment of the event/nb\nnormalisation of the corresponding MT samples to obtain acceptable \u03c72 values.\nThe most natural method would be to extend the one-dimensional analysis presented in this section\ninto two-dimensional analysis of both the mass and the normalisation parameters.

Instead, we have tried to un-correlate the adjustment of the\nnormalisation parameter and the mass parameters. As can be seen in Fig. 5.4.(a) the Asym(+,\u2212) (pT,l )\ndistribution is, in the region of small pT,l (pT,l . 35 GeV), independent of the variations of \u2206(+,\u2212)\nover the range discussed here. We use this observation and modify correspondingly the likelihood\nanalysis method. Before calculating \u03c72 , the PD and MT distributions are integrated in the range :\n!\nZ 35 GeV\nd Asym(+,\u2212)\nd pT,l\n,\n(5.16)\nd pT,l\n20 GeV\ngiving respectively two scalars : \u03b1 and \u03b2 (n) . Then we re-normalise the nth. MT distribution by the\nfactor \u03b1/\u03b2 (n) and calculate the \u03c72 values for the rescaled distributions. We have checked that the\nabove procedure improves significantly the resulting \u03c72 values for each of the three analysis methods.\nBy changing the integration region we have verified that the above procedure does not introduce\nsignificant biases in the estimated \u2206(+,\u2212) (\u03be) values.\nThe effect of this trick can be visualised on a concrete example where we consider the incriminated\nbias to reflect an overestimation of the PDF. The consequences of the different cross section between\nthe PD with respect to the one of the central MT (0) (\u2206(+,\u2212) = 0) histogram can be seen directly in\nFig. 5.5.(a) and more finely in frame (c) where the normalised difference between the two histograms\nhave been drawn. In (c) then, we observe an overall scaling factor \u2013constant below the jacobian peak\u2013\nbetween the two plots that will ultimately wreck any chance for the \u03c72 test to converge and then give\na relevant result. Computing the scalars \u03b1 and \u03b2 (0) allows to scale MT (0) by multiplying it with\n\u03b1/\u03b2 (0) as shown in Figs. 5.5.(b) and (d).\n\n5.3\n\nSystematic error sources\n\nIn this section we identify and model the systematic error sources that will limit the precision of the\nMW + \u2212 MW \u2212 measurement at the LHC. Each of these error source will be modeled and reflected in\nthe corresponding PD sample of events.\nThese error sources are of two kinds : (1) those reflecting uncertainties in modeling of the W boson\nproduction and decay processes, (2) those reflecting the event selection and event reconstruction\nbiases. A large fraction of the error sources have been identified [51] and reevaluated in the context\nof the measurement of the average mass of the W boson at the LHC [57, 58].

As demonstrated\nin the analysis of the Tevatron data [51], they are of secondary importance.\n\n5.3.1\n\nPhenomenological modeling uncertainties\n\nThe uncertainties in the modeling of the production and decay of the W bosons include : (1) the\nuncertainties in modeling of non-perturbative effects, (2) the approximations present in theoretical\nmodeling of the perturbative EW and QCD effects, (3) the uncertainties in the parameters of the\nStandard Model and (4) a possible presence of the Beyond Standard Model (BSM) effects, affecting\nboth the production and decay mechanisms of the W bosons. The two first items of them limit our\npresent understanding of the Wide-Band-partonic-Beam (WBpB) at the LHC.\n(a)\n\nWBpB at LHC\n\nThe measurement precision of the W mass charge asymmetry will depend upon the level of understanding of the flavour structure, the momentum spectrum and the emittance of the WBpB at the\n\n\f5.3 Systematic error sources\n\n143\n\nLHC collision energy. The hard scale dependent emittance of the WBpB is defined here, in analogy\nto the emittance of the parent hadron beam, in terms of its transverse momentum distribution and\nin terms of its transverse and longitudinal beam-spot sizes. The above dynamic properties of the\nWBpB are highly correlated. Only their scale dependence can be controlled by the Standard Model\nperturbative methods. In addition, several aspects of such a control, in particular the precise modeling of the correlations between the flavour, the longitudinal and the transverse momentum degrees\nof freedom of the WBpB have not so far been implemented in the Monte Carlo generators available\nfor the initial phase of the LHC experimental program.\nThe statu quo of understanding of the WBpB at the LHC is driven by the presently available\nMonte Carlo generator tools. Within this statu quo, the flavour dependent longitudinal momentum\ndistribution of the WBpB, specified by 'collinear' PDFs, is fed to one of the available parton shower\nMC generators. The transverse momentum distribution of the WBpB is then derived from the\nassumed longitudinal one. This procedure depends upon a particular evolution scheme dependent\nform of the parton shower and upon the order of the perturbative expansion. It depends as well\nupon the modeling method of the quark flavour (quark mass) effects in the parton shower generation.\nThe effects of the flavour dependence of the beam size in the transverse plane are partially controlled\nusing auxiliary, impact parameter dependent re-summation procedures. Finally, the scale dependent\nevolution of the longitudinal beam spot size is presently assumed to be driven by the DGLAP evolution\nequations [30, 31, 32].\nIt is obvious that the precision of the present understanding of the WBpB at the LHC is difficult\nto asses within the above modeling environment. Since its impact on the precision measurements of\nelectroweak processes will be significantly higher for the LHC WBpB with respect to the Tevatron\none, some novel measurement and/or modeling schemes must be developed. They must assure either\nbetter theoretical control of the WBpB parameters or, as proposed, reduce their impact on the\nmeasured observables to such an extent that their detailed modeling becomes irrelevant. For the\nlatter strategy it is sufficient to rely on crude modeling methods of the WBpB at the LHC which are\navailable within the WINHAC generator.\n(b)\n\nUncertainty of PDFs\n\nThe uncertainties in PDFs are, most often, propagated to the measurement errors of the physics\nobservables by varying the PDF sets chosen in the event generation process. Alternatively, the\nuncertainties of the QCD fit parameters of a given PDF set are propagated by re-weighting the\ngenerated events with \"min\" and \"max\" weights, PDFmax/min = PDFcen \u00b1 \u03b4PDF, where PDFcen are\nthe central value distributions of a given PDF set and \u03b4PDF is computed according to the method\ndescribed in Ref. [66]. We followed the latter method, mostly because of computing time constraints.\nWe have used the CTEQ6.1M PDF set [192] in modeling of the standard PDFs uncertainties. The\nabove methods, in our view, largely underestimate the influence of the PDFs uncertainty on the\nmeasurement precision of the W boson mass.\nAs discussed in the last Chapter, the charge asymmetry of the W boson production and decay\nprocesses is sensitive : (1) the presence of valence quarks in the WBpB, (2) the flavour asymmetry\nof their longitudinal momentum distribution (called hereafter the u(v) \u2212 d(v) asymmetry) and (3)\nthe asymmetry in the relative momentum distribution of the strange and charm quarks (the s \u2212 c\nasymmetry). The corresponding uncertainties must be modeled directly using the existing (future)\nexperimental constraints rather than be derived from the uncertainty of the PDF set parameters.\nThis is because they are driven almost entirely by the non perturbative effects, and because the QCD\nevolution effects are, except for the quark mass dependency, flavour independent.\n(c)\n\nUncertainty of u(v) \u2212 d(v) asymmetry.\n\nWe assume the following two ways of modeling the uncertainty in the u(v) \u2212 d(v) asymmetry :\n(v)\n\numax/min = u(v) \u00b1 0.05 u(v) ,\n\n(v)\n\ndmin/max = d(v) \u2213 0.05 u(v) ,\n\n(5.17)\n\n\f144\nand\n\nStrategy for a reduction of the systematic errors on MW+ \u2212 MW\u2212\n(v)\n\numax/min = u(v) \u00b1 0.02 u(v) ,\n\n(v)\n\ndmin/max = d(v) \u2213 0.08 d(v) .\n\n(5.18)\n\nThe first one preserves the sum of the distribution of the u and d quarks and is constrained, to a good\nprecision, by the measured singlet structure function in neutrino and anti-neutrino Deep Inelastic\nScattering (DIS) of isoscalar nuclei. At the LHC the sum of the distributions will be constrained by\nthe rapidity distribution of the Z bosons (d quarks and u quarks contribute with similar weights).\nThe second one assures the correct propagation of the measurement errors of the sum of the charge\nsquare weighted distributions of the u and d quarks, constrained by the high precision charged lepton\nbeam DIS data, to the uncertainty of the individual distributions.\nWhile the sums of the distributions are well controlled by the existing and future data, their\nmutually compensating shifts are not. The only experimental constraints on such shifts come from :\n(1) the measurements of the ratio of the cross sections for deep inelastic scattering of charged leptons\non proton and deuteron targets and (2) the measurements of the ratio of the neutrino\u2013proton to antineutrino\u2013proton DIS cross sections. They determine the present uncertainty range of the u(v) \u2212 d(v)\nasymmetry. Improving this uncertainty range in the standard p p LHC colliding mode will be difficult\nand ambiguous. It will require simultaneous unfolding of the momentum distribution and the charge\nasymmetry of the sea quarks.\n(d)\n\nUncertainty of s \u2212 c asymmetry\n\nThe cs annihilation represent \u2248 7 % of the total contribution to the W boson production cross section\nat the Tevatron collision energy. At the LHC collision energy it rises to \u2248 25 % and becomes charge\nasymmetric : \u2248 21 % for the W + boson and \u2248 28 % for the W \u2212 boson. The uncertainty in the\nrelative distribution of the strange and charm quarks becomes an important source of systematic\nmeasurement errors of both the average W boson mass and its charge asymmetry.\nWe assume the two following ways of modeling the uncertainty in the s \u2212 c asymmetry :\nsmax/min = s \u00b1 \u03b3 c,\n\ncmin/max = c \u2213 \u03b3 c\n\n(5.19)\n\nwith \u03b3 = {0.2, 0.1} representing respectively the present and future uncertainty range for the relative\nshifts in the s and c quark distributions. As in the case of the u(v) \u2212 d(v) asymmetry, we have assumed\nthat the sum of the distribution of the s and c quarks will be controlled to a very good precision\nby the Z boson rapidity distribution. Therefore we have introduced only unconstrained, mutually\ncompensating modifications of the s and c quark distributions1 . As seen previously in Eqs. (4.2) and\n(4.3), the valence quarks excess magnifies the contribution of the s\u2212c uncertainty to the measurement\nprecision of W boson mass.\n(e)\n\nWBpB emittance\n\nThe u(v) \u2212d(v) and s\u2212c longitudinal momentum asymmetries would have no effect on the measured W\nboson mass asymmetry in the case of the collinear partonic beams. The angular divergence (transverse\nmomentum smearing) of the WBpB at the LHC is driven by the gluon radiation. Its parton shower\nMonte Carlo model determines the relationship between the longitudinal and the transverse degrees\nof freedom of the WBpB. It gives rise to the parton shower model dependent asymmetries of the W +\nand W \u2212 boson transverse momenta.\nInstead of trying to estimate the uncertainties related to the precision of the parton shower\nmodeling of the the quark flavour dependent effects, we allow for exceedingly large uncertainty\nin the size of the flavour independent primordial transverse momentum Gaussian smearing of the\nWBpB : hkT i = 4+3\n\u22122 GeV (the PD samples have been simulated for the following values of the sigma\nparameter of the Gaussian smearing : hkT i = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 GeV). Such a large uncertainty range,\n1\n\nIn reality, the s and c quarks couple to the Z boson with slightly different strength but the resulting effect will play\nno important role in the presented analysis.\n\n\f5.3 Systematic error sources\n\n145\n\neasily controllable using the Z boson transverse momentum distribution, represents the effect of\namplifying (small values of hkT i) or smearing out (large values of hkT i) the flavour dependent asymmetries of the WBpB transverse momentum. The range has been chosen to be large enough to cover\nthe uncertainties due to : (1) non perturbative effects, e.g. those discussed in [193], (2) the quark\nmass effects and (3) re-summation effects.\n(f )\n\nEW radiative corrections\n\nOut of the full set of the EW radiative corrections implemented in the WINHAC generator, those\nrepresenting the emission of real photons could contribute to the measured W mass charge asymmetry.\nTwo effects need to be evaluated : the charge asymmetric interference terms between the photon\nemission in the initial and final states, and the radiation of the photons in the W boson decays in the\npresence of the V \u2212 A couplings. The above corrections are described to a high precision by WINHAC,\nas has been shown in Refs. [140, 142]. Therefore, their influence on the W mass charge asymmetry\nmeasurement can be modeled very accurately. We did not considered these effects, leaving a detailed\nstudy for our future works.\n\n5.3.2\n(a)\n\nExperimental uncertainties\nEnergy scale (ES) of the charged lepton\n\nThe uncertainty in the lepton energy scale is the most important source of the MW measurement error\nfor the Tevatron experiments. At the LHC, the production of unequal numbers of W + and W \u2212 bosons,\nits impact on the overall measurement precision will be amplified. For the measurement methods\ndiscussed the lepton energy scale error will be determined : (1) by the curvature radius measurement\nerrors, (2) by the uncertainties in the magnetic field maps within the tracker volume and (3) by the\nmodeling precision of the physics processes which drive the link between the measurements of the\nparticle hits in the tracker and the reconstructed particle momentum. While the first two sources of\nthe measurement error are independent of the lepton flavour, the third one affects the electron and\nmuon samples differently. In the following we shall assume, on the basis of the Tevatron experience,\nthat modeling of physics processes of particle tracking will be understood at the LHC to the required\nlevel of precision, on the basis of dedicated auxiliary measurements2 . This simplification allows us\nto discuss the muon and electron track measurement simultaneously. We assume as well that the\nsolenoid magnetic field strength in the volume of the tracker will be understood to better than 0.1 %\nof its nominal value. We base this assumption on the precision of 0.01 % achieved e.g. by the H1\nexperiment at HERA [194] and by the ALEPH experiment at LEP [195]. If this condition is fulfilled,\nthe energy scale error \u03b5l is driven by the curvature radius measurement error\n(rec.)\n\n\u03c1T,l\n(rec.)\n\n(smr.)\n\n= \u03c1T,l\n\n(1 + \u03b5l ),\n\n(5.20)\n\n(smr.)\n\nwhere \u03c1T,l and \u03c1T,l\nare, respectively, the reconstructed and the true curvature smeared by the\nunbiased detector response function.\nBased on the initial geometrical surveys, the initial scale of \u03c1T,l will be known to the precision of\n0.5 %. This precision will have to be improved at least by a factor of 10 to match the precision of the\nTevatron experiments, if the same measurement strategy is applied. To achieve such a precision, the\nlocal alignment of the tracker elements and/or average biases of the reconstruction of the trackers\nspace-points must be known to the \u2248 3 \u03bcm precision. In addition, the global deformation of the\ntracker elements assembly must be controlled to a precision which is beyond the reach of the survey\nmethods.\nSeveral modes of the global deformations can be considered in a first approximation as discussed\nin Ref. [107]. Below we make a sum up of the conclusions drew from \u00a7 2.4 and Appendix 2.A. The\n2\n\nFor example, the energy loss of the electrons in the dead material within the tracker volume will be understood\nusing a conjugate process of the photon conversion.\n\n\f146\n\nStrategy for a reduction of the systematic errors on MW+ \u2212 MW\u2212\n\nmain difference between the measurements of the W boson properties at the Tevatron and the LHC\nboils down to their sensitivity to the different types of the global deformation modes. Both for\nthe Tevatron and LHC measurements the \u2206z translations are of no consequences since they do not\naffect the shape of the transverse projection of the particle helix. The \u2206r deformations (the radial\nexpansion r \u2206r, the elliptical flattening \u03c6 \u2206r and the bowing z \u2206r) give rise to common biases for\npositive and negative particle tracks. On the other hand, the \u2206\u03c6 curl and twist deformations give\nrise to biases which are opposite for negative and positive particles. In the case of the Tevatron p p\u0304\ncollisions, producing equal numbers of the W + and W \u2212 bosons, the dominant effect of \u00b1z-coherent\ncurling of the outer tracker layers with respect to the inner tracker layers has residual influence on\nthe uncertainty of the average W boson mass, leaving the residual effect of relative twist of the +z\nand \u2212z sides of the tracker volume as the principal source of the measurement error. For the LHC p p\ncollisions, producing unequal numbers of the W + and W \u2212 bosons, both deformation modes influence\nthe measurement biases of the average W boson mass. In the case of the LHC there is no escape\nfrom the necessity of precise understanding of the lepton charge dependent biases on top of the lepton\ncharge independent biases.\nIn the presence of the above two sources of biases the energy scale bias \u03b5l can be expressed in the\nlimit of small deformations (cf. Eqs. (2.22\u20132.23)) as follow\n\u03b5l +\n\n=\n\n\u03b5\u2206\u03c6 + \u03b5\u2206r ,\n\n(5.21)\n\n\u03b5l \u2212\n\n= \u2212\u03b5\u2206\u03c6 + \u03b5\u2206r ,\n\n(5.22)\n\nwhere \u03b5\u2206\u03c6 represents the particle charge dependent \u2206\u03c6-type bias and \u03b5\u2206r represents the charge\nindependent \u2206r-type bias.\nWhile the \u03b5\u2206r -type biases can be controlled with the help of the Z boson, \u03a5 and J/\u03a8 \"standard\ncandles\", e.g. using the CDF procedures, the global charge dependent and symmetric \u03b5curl biases\ncannot. At the Tevatron these biases were investigated using the electron samples by studying the\ncharge dependent E/p distribution, where E is the energy of the electron (positron) measured in the\ncalorimeter and p is its reconstructed momentum. The relative scale error of positive and negative\nelectrons was re-calibrated using the mean values of the E/p distributions. The achieved precision\nwas the principal limiting factor of the measurement of \u2206(+,\u2212) . Even if the statistical precision of\nsuch a procedure can be improved significantly at the LHC, this method is no longer unbiased. This\nis related to the initial asymmetry of the transverse momentum distribution for positive and negative\nleptons in the selected W boson decay samples. As a consequence, both the positive and negative\nlepton events, chosen for the calibration on the basis of the energy deposited in the calorimeter, will\nno longer represent charge unbiased samples of tracks. The biases will be driven both by the influence\nof distribution shape and by the migration in and out of the chosen energy range. A partial remedy\nconsists of using a statistically less precise sample of positive and negative lepton tracks in a selected\nsample of Z boson decays. However, due to the different weights of the V \u2212 A and V + A couplings\nof the Z boson to leptons, even these track samples are biased. In both cases these biases can be\ncorrected for, but the correction factor will be sensitive to the uncertainty in the momentum spectra\nof the valence quarks.\nGiven the above sources of the uncertainties, we assume the following two values for the size of\nthe biases, both for the charge independent and charge dependent scale shifts\n\u03b5l+ = +\u03b5l\u2212\n\u03b5l+ = \u2212\u03b5l\u2212\n\n= \u00b10.5 %, \u00b10.05 %,\n\n= \u00b10.5 %, \u00b10.05 %.\n\n(5.23)\n(5.24)\n\nThe first value corresponds to the precision which can be achieved on the basis of the initial geometrical\nsurvey and the initial measurement of the field maps. The second one corresponds to what, in our\nview, can be achieved using the above data based on the calibration methods \u2013given all the LHC\nspecific effects\u2013 which make this procedure more difficult at the LHC than at the Tevatron.\n\n\f5.4 In search for the optimal measurement strategy\n(b)\n\n147\n\nResolution (RF) of the charged lepton track parameters\n\nThe finite resolution of measuring the lepton track parameters may lead to biases in the measured\nvalue of MW + \u2212 MW \u2212 . We model the possible biases introduced by the ambiguity in the assumed\nsize of the \u03c31/pT (Eq. (2.15)) and \u03c3cotan \u03b8 (Eq. (2.16)) smearing by decreasing or increasing the widths\nof their Gaussian distributions by the factor RF = 0.7, 1.3.\n\n5.4\n5.4.1\n\nIn search for the optimal measurement strategy\nValidation of the framework and behaviour of the likelihood analysis\n\nBefore presenting the results, now that we have a global idea of the challenge we present a few more\ndetails on the validation of the analysis framework from both technical and physical point of views\nand look also at the influence on the results of some input parameters to the analysis process. The\nfollowing tests were performed for trivial (\u03be = 0) as well as non trivial results (\u03be 6= 0) when necessary,\ni.e. when \u2206(+,\u2212) (\u03be)min \u001d 0 and/or \u03c72min /dof \u001d 1. Since most of these tests are quite redundant they\nwere not included in the core of the Chapter in the aim not to break the flow of the expose. Rather\nthan that, the gist of it was compiled at the end of the present Chapter. Hence, in what follows the\ncorresponding sections in the Appendix are indicated so that the reader wishing to have quantitative\nresults on a particular topic knows where to find them.\nThe first test consisted to cross check the framework using for all three methods the observable\n\u03c1T,l (\u00a7 5.A.1.(a)). All results (\u03be = 0 and \u03be 6= 0) confirmed the calculus using pT,l -based methods.\nSince trivial validation tests (\u03be = 0) displays MW + \u2212 MW \u2212 = 0 the relevancy of the sign of the\nresult cannot be checked, also we generated PD with a shift of + 100 MeV with respect to the mass\nof reference of the W bosons and saw that indeed the signs were coherent (\u00a7 5.A.1.(b)).\nUsing these shifted masses in the PD allow on a technical level to see at which level the convergence\nof a result depends of the number and localisation of MT from the minimum of the parabola. Thus,\nby playing with the number of the MT samples participating to the analysis and choosing them such\nthat all MT masses are far and on one side only from the minimum we can show that the convergence,\nand in consequence \u2206(+,\u2212) , suffers in such extreme configurations (\u00a7 5.A.2.(a)). Nonetheless the order\nof the size of the error is respected. Also, despite our reduced number of MT samples, in what follows\nresults displaying large values of \u2206(+,\u2212) (\u03be)min can be trusted.\nThe influence of the detector resolution on the results was investigated by increasing the size of the\nbin widths of the PD and MT histograms before performing the analysis. It proved that the \u03c72 test\nis quite robust so that values are very close to the one obtained with the nominal resolution, excepted\nfor the convergence accuracy which suffers much more from lower resolution when \u2206(+,\u2212) (\u03be)min \u001d 0\n(\u00a7 5.A.2.(b)).\nThe charge asymmetry method being new we considered a spread in the analysis range to perform\nthe \u03c72 analysis which is not possible in the classic method without a very good knowledge of the\nbackground at low pT and of the influence of \u0393W at high pT . Tests based on Asym(+,\u2212) (pT,l )\nperformed in the range 20 GeV < pT,l < 50 GeV and then in 20 GeV < pT,l < 60 GeV displayed\nno real enhancements on the results apart from slightly increasing the precision of the convergence\n\u03c72min /dof (\u00a7 5.A.2.(c)). This can be understood as the mass of the W has a real impact on the region\nwhere the jacobian peak arise. Nonetheless with real data this could provide a good test to see a\ndependence of the results from the background and W width influence on the extraction of the mass\nwith this method.\nLast but not least the test of the influence of a E\n/ T cut on the result was performed by doing at\nthe stage of the generation directly a cut on pT,\u03bdl . The consequences on the results are absolutely not\nvisible and it is believed that a realistic cut based on E\n/ T would display the same feature (\u00a7 5.A.2.(d)).\nThis test justify then the non treatment of realistic E\n/ T cuts and recoil modeling in our analysis.\nTo conclude, from all these tests the one having the most striking effect on the calculus was\nfound to be the lack of MT samples thinly separated and covering a large range of masses. As\n\n\f148\n\nStrategy for a reduction of the systematic errors on MW+ \u2212 MW\u2212\n\nstated previously the CPU was prohibitive to refine the analysis and would not have brought much\nenhancement as most of the systematic error \u2206(+,\u2212) (\u03be) absolute values, as it will be shown, are such\nthat |\u2206(+,\u2212) (\u03be)| < 200 MeV. Also, to preserve a better clarity of the discussion \u2013as independent as\npossible from the choice of the input parameters\u2013 we have chosen that all the \u03c72 presented in the\ncore of the Chapter were made for mass templates MT covering the range \u00b1200 MeV.\nFinally, just out of curiosity and to insist on the difference between the kinematics of the charged\nlepton decaying from a W + or a W \u2212 at the LHC we considered the case where \u2013not aware of the\nV \u2212 A coupling of fermions in electroweak interactions\u2013 the \u03c72 test is made between pseudo-data\nrelated to the W + information and the mass templates related to the W \u2212 information. Performing\nsuch a naive test assuming similar kinematics for the positive and negative charged leptons gives\nabsolutely non relevant results, such that MW + \u2212 MW \u2212 (\u03be = 0) \u223c 1 GeV and \u03c72min /dof \u223c 10, 000\n(cf. Appendix 5.B).\n\n5.4.2\n\nReducing impact of systematic measurement errors\n\nIn Section 5.1 three measurement methods of \u2206(+,\u2212) have been presented : the classic, charge asymmetry and double charge asymmetry methods. The basic merits of the two latter methods is that\nthey use the dedicated observables which are meant to be largely insensitive to the precise understanding of the event selection and reconstruction efficiency, the background contamination level,\nunderstanding to the absolute calibration and the biases of the reconstruction of the neutrino transverse momentum, the internal and external (dead-material) radiation. It will remain to be proved,\nusing the data collected at the LHC, that all these error sources have negligible impact on the precision of the \u2206(+,\u2212) measurement. At present, such a statement must rely on the extrapolation of the\nTevatron experience. In what follows, links to detailed comments and/or graphics for each addressed\nsystematic error are made to the Appendix 5.C since for clarity we kept only the essential information\nin the core of the Chapter.\nThe impact of the remaining measurement errors specified in the previous Section and quantified\nusing the analysis methods discussed in Section 5.2 is presented in Table 5.4.\nThe precision of estimating the systematic shifts of \u2206(+,\u2212) (\u03be) for each of the systematic effect \u03be\nand each measurement\nmethod\nis assessed using the validation procedures described in Section 5.2.\n\u0002\n\u0003\nThe resulting \u03b4 \u2206(+,\u2212) (\u03be) of \u2248 5 MeV corresponds the collected luminosity of 10 fb\u22121 . The first\nobservation is that the precise understanding of the measurement smearing RF of the track parameters\ndoes not introduce any bias in the measured values of \u2206(+,\u2212) . The impact of the energy scale errors\non the \u2206(+,\u2212) biases differs for each of the discussed methods.\nFor the lepton charge independent shift even the \"initial\" (0.5 %) scale error has no statistically\nsignificant impact on the measurement precision for the charge asymmetry method. For the classic\nmethod the scale error has to be reduced to the \"ultimate\" value of (0.05 %) to achieve a comparable\nmeasurement precision of \u2206(+,\u2212) .\nFor the lepton charge dependent shifts the classic and asymmetry methods provide similar measurement precision. The measurement error remains to be of the order of \u2248 60 MeV even if the\nultimate precision of controlling the energy scale biases to 0.05 % is reached. The double charge\nasymmetry method reduces the measurement error to the extend that the resulting bias is statistically insignificant, even for the initial scale uncertainty. This is illustrated in Figures 5.6.(a) and\n5.6.(b). These plots show the comparison of the \u03c72 fits for the charge asymmetry method and the\ndouble charge asymmetry method for the lepton charge dependent scale error of \u03b5l = \u00b10.05 % (a),\nand the \u03c72 fit corresponding to \u03b5l = \u00b10.5 % for the double charge asymmetry method (b). The results\nfor the double charge asymmetry correspond to \u03b5l+ = \u2212\u03b5l\u2212 > 0 for the first running period with the\nstandard magnetic field configuration and \u03b5l+ = \u2212\u03b5l\u2212 < 0 for the running period with the inverted\ndirection of the z-component of the magnetic field.\nThe above reduction of the measurement sensitivity to the energy scale error can be achieved\nfor the initial survey precision of the tracker alignment. Such a survey will have to be made at the\nbeginning of each of the two running periods. A special care will have to be taken to understand\n\n\f5.4 In search for the optimal measurement strategy\nMW + \u2212 MW \u2212\n\nSystematic \u03be\nMC truth\n\n\u03be=0\n\nCent.

Similarly, the required level of precision of understanding the hysteresis\neffects, leading to inequality of the absolute field strength in the two running periods, corresponding\nto reverse solenoid current directions can be achieved with the standard field mapping methods. Note\nthat the precision required for the asymmetry measurement may be up to 10 times worse with respect\nto the one needed for the measurement of the average W boson mass. The reduced sensitivity to\nall the above effects is due to the fact that the impact of each of these effects is, to a large extent,\ncanceled in each of the running periods. This is done in the same way as canceling the time-dependent\neffects of the detector response, calibration and alignment procedures. Note, that the residual impact\n~\nof all the above effects can be reduced further (if necessary) using the B-field\nconfiguration dependent\nanalyses of straight track residua and/or the position of the reconstructed Z boson mass peak.\nDetailed comments and graphics on the impact of the energy scale ES of the charged lepton and\nof the resolution smearing RF of its track parameters are presented respectively in \u00a7 5.C.(a) and\n\u00a7 5.C.(b) of Appendix 5.C.\n\n5.4.3\n\nReducing impact of systematic modeling errors\n\nAs discussed in the previous section, by using the charge asymmetry (double charge asymmetry)\nmethods the systematic measurement precision of \u2206(+,\u2212) could be reduced to the level of O(10) MeV.\nIn this section we discuss the impact of the modeling uncertainties described in Subsection 5.3.1 on\nthe measurement precision of \u2206(+,\u2212) for the charge asymmetry method3 . The detailed discussion and\ngraphics related to the systematic errors due to the uncertainties on the intrinsic kT , global PDF, the\nvalence u \u2212 d and sea s \u2212 c asymmetry are present from \u00a7 (c) through \u00a7 (e) of Appendix 5.C.\nIn Table 5.5 we show, in the first column, the expected measurement biases of \u2206(+,\u2212) due to\nthe dominant modeling uncertainties, discussed in the previous section, for p p collisions at the LHC\nenergy. We do not see a significant impact of the coherent shifts of the partonic distributions, defined\nin the previous section and denoted as the PDFs uncertainty. It would be, however, misleading\nto conclude prematurely that the \u2206(+,\u2212) biases are insensitive to the uncertainties in the partonic\ndistributions.\nIndeed, the present uncertainty of the relative distribution of the the u and d valence quarks (the\nu(v) \u2212 d(v) asymmetry) leads to large shifts in the \u2206(+,\u2212) values. These shifts are specific to the\nLHC p p collider and are largely irrelevant for the Tevatron p p\u0304 collisions. This might explain why\nthey were neglected in the previous studies [57, 58], in spite that they concern the average W boson\nmass measurement. There are three origins for these shifts. The effects due to each of them add up\nand result in the amplification of the biases. The discussion and the numbers provided in \u00a7 4.A.6 of\nChapter 4 might be helpful to understand the following ideas. Firstly, increasing the u(v) content of\nthe proton shifts downwards the average momentum of the d \u0304 anti-quarks. This leads to an increase of\nthe average transverse momentum pT,d \u0304 of the d \u0304 anti-quarks producing W + , mimicking the increase\nof the W + boson mass. Simultaneous decreasing of the d(v) acts in the opposite direction for W \u2212 , i.e.\nthis time the average pT of the colliding sea quark decreases which lead to large and positive values\nof \u2206(+,\u2212) . Secondly, at the LHC, contrary to the Tevatron, the presence of the d(v) quarks leads to\nan asymmetry in the production rate of the W boson from the c quarks and c\u0304 anti-quarks. Since the\naverage transverse momentum of the charm quarks is higher with respect to the light quarks, this\nasymmetry shows up in the relative shifts in the pT,l distributions for positive and negative leptons.\nIncreasing the density of the d(v) quarks mimics thus the effect of increasing the mass of the W \u2212\nwith respect to the W + boson. The above two effects are amplified by the bias in the degree of the\ntransverse polarisation of W \u2212 with respect to W + , induced by the event selection procedure based\non the lepton kinematics. The relative movements of the d(v) and u(v) amplify (attenuate) the initial\nevent selection procedure bias. What must be stressed is that if the d(v) shifts are compensated by\n3\n\nFrom the point of view of the modeling uncertainties, the charge asymmetry and the double charge asymmetry\nmethods are equivalent and the discussed results are the same for both methods.\n\n\f5.4 In search for the optimal measurement strategy\n\nMC truth\nCent.

Thus, it will be\ndifficult to pin them down using the standard measurement procedures.\nThe uncertainties of the relative density of the strange and charm quarks, the s \u2212 c asymmetry,\ngives rise to smaller but significant biases in the \u2206(+,\u2212) values, as shown in the first column of Table 5.5. Since the transverse momentum of the c quarks is significantly higher than the corresponding\nmomentum for the s quarks, this effect, even if Cabbibo suppressed, cannot be neglected. What\nmust be stressed again is that if the c shifts are compensated by the corresponding shifts of the s\ndistributions, they will not affect the rapidity distributions of the Z bosons. Thus, it will be difficult\nto pin them down using the standard measurement procedures. This asymmetry can be constrained\nunambiguously only by using dedicated measurements, e.g. by measuring the associated production\nof the W bosons and charmed hadrons.\nCompared to the above, the biases corresponding to the uncertainties in the flavour independent\nsmearing of the intrinsic transverse momentum distribution of partons are smaller in magnitude and\ncan be neglected, if the intrinsic transverse momentum of partons is controlled to the precision of\n2 GeV.\nIt is obvious from the above discussion that using the standard measurement procedures, the\nmodeling uncertainties will be the dominant source of the measurement errors of the W boson mass\nasymmetry, already for the collected luminosity 100 times smaller than the one considered here. In\norder to diminish the impact of the modeling errors on the measurement of \u2206(+,\u2212) to a level comparable to statistical and experimental measurement errors, some dedicated measurement methods\nmust be applied. Two such procedures are proposed and evaluated below : (1) the narrow bin method\nand (2) the isoscalar beams method.\n(a)\n\nNarrow bin method\n\nAs discussed previously, the dominant source of large uncertainties in \u2206(+,\u2212) comes from the presence\nof the valence quarks in the WBpB and from the uncertainties in their flavour dependent momentum\ndistributions. In order to reduce this effect we propose to profit from the large centre of mass energy\nof the LHC and measure \u2206(+,\u2212) using a selected fraction of the W bosons which are produced\npredominantly by the sea rather than by the valence quarks. These W bosons are produced with\nsmall longitudinal momentum in the laboratory frame.\nTwo methods of selecting such a sample are discussed below. The first is based on restricting\nthe measurement region to |\u03b7l | < 0.3. The merit of the \u03b7l -cut based selection is that it uses a\ndirectly measurable kinematic variable. Its drawback is that rather broad spectrum of the longitudinal\nmomenta of annihilating partons is accepted due to the large mass of the W boson. The second is\nbased on restricting the measurement region to |yW | < 0.3. Here, only a narrow bin of the longitudinal\nmomenta of annihilating partons is accepted in the region where the sea quarks outnumber the valence\nquarks. However, yW cannot be measured directly. It has to be unfolded from the measured transverse\nmomentum of the charged lepton and the reconstructed transverse momentum of the neutrino. The\nunfolding procedure [67] neglects the width of the W boson and depends upon the initial assumption\nof the relative momentum spectra of the valence and sea quarks. However, in the selected kinematic\nregion the above approximation are expected to lead to a negligible measurement bias. It has to\nbe stressed that the narrow bin measurements will require a 10 times higher luminosity to keep the\nstatistical error of \u2206(+,\u2212) at the level of 5 MeV. Therefore, the results presented below for the narrow\nbin method correspond to an integrated luminosity of 100 fb\u22121 and are based on the dedicated set of\nthe simulated mass template and pseudo-data samples. Each sample contains NW + = 1.74 \u00d7 109 and\nNW \u2212 = 1.14 \u00d7 109 simulated (weighted) events, respectively.\nThe systematic biases of \u2206(+,\u2212) due to modeling uncertainties discussed in the previous sections\nare presented in columns 2 and 3 of Table 5.5 respectively for the |\u03b7l | < 0.3 and |yW | < 0.3 selections.\nThe \u03b7l -cut based method reduces slightly the biases related to the uncertainties in the u(v) \u2212 d(v)\n\n\f5.4 In search for the optimal measurement strategy\n\n153\n\nand s \u2212 c asymmetries. The gain in the measurement precision is clearly seen for the yW -cut based\nmethod which reduces to a negligible level the s \u2212 c biases. It is interesting to note that the u(v) \u2212 d(v)\nshifts in \u2206(+,\u2212) change their signs for the above two methods, reflecting the importance of the W\nboson polarisation effects discussed earlier.\nThe narrow bin method allows, thus to reduce the impact of the W boson modeling uncertainties\non the \u2206(+,\u2212) biases to the level comparable to the statistical precision for all the effects, except for\nthe u(v) \u2212 d(v) asymmetry effect. Here another remedy has to be found.\n(b)\n\nIsoscalar beams\n\nIsoscalar targets have been successfully used in most of the previous fix-target deep inelastic scattering\nexperiments at SLAC, FNAL and CERN, but this aspect has been rarely discussed in the context\nof the electroweak physics at the LHC. The merits of the ion beams for the generic searches of the\nelectroweak symmetry breaking mechanism at the LHC have been discussed in [144]. Their use as\ncarriers of the parasitic electron beam, to measure the emittance of the WBpB at the LHC, has been\nproposed in [196]. In our work we strongly advocate the merits of the isoscalar beams in improving the\nmeasurement precision of the parameters of the Standard Model. In this section we discuss their role\nin increasing the precision of the measurement of \u2206(+,\u2212) . We shall consider light ions : deuterium or\nhelium. As far as the studies of the W boson asymmetries are concerned, they are equivalent because\nshadowing corrections are quark-flavour independent. The energies of the LHC ion beams satisfy the\nequal magnetic rigidity condition. For the isoscalar beams the nucleon energy is thus two times lower\nthat the energy of the proton beam. In the presented studies we assume that the ion\u2013ion luminosity\nis reduced by the factor A2 with respect to the p p luminosity (cf. \u00a7 2.1.1).\nIn column 4 of Table 5.5 we present the impact of the modeling uncertainties on the \u2206(+,\u2212) biases.\nThe isoscalar beams allow to reduce the measurement biases due to the u(v) \u2212 d(v) asymmetry effect\nto a negligible level. This colliding beam configuration allows to profit from the isospin symmetry of\nthe strong interactions which cancels the relative biases in the momentum distribution of the u and\nd quarks. It is interesting to note that, as expected, the s \u2212 c biases are similar for the proton and\nfor the light isoscalar beams. On the contrary, the biases related to the flavour independent intrinsic\nmomentum of the quarks and anti-quarks are amplified due to the reduced centre of mass collision\nenergy4 . Indeed, as seen already in \u00a7 4.A.7 we came up to the conclusion that at lower energies in\nthe center of mass the charge asymmetry in the final state is much more visible since the charge\nsymmetric sea contributions are not large enough.\n\n5.4.4\n\nTwo complementary strategies\n\nTwo complementary strategies to achieve the ultimate measurement precision of \u2206(+,\u2212) will certainly\nbe tried. The first one will be based on an attempt to reduce the size of the systematic measurement\nand modeling uncertainties, discussed in the previous section. In our view, such a strategy will quickly\nreach the precision brick wall \u2013 mostly due to the a lack of data-driven constraints on modeling the\nflavour dependent W boson production at the LHC energy. The second one, instead of reducing the\nsize of the uncertainties, attempts to reduce their impact on the systematic error of the measured\nquantity by applying the dedicated methods. Such a strategy requires running the dedicated machine\nand detector configurations. It is thus time and luminosity consuming. However, in our view, only\nsuch a strategy allows to measure the W mass charge asymmetries at the precision comparable to\nthe one achieved in the muon decay experiments.\nLet us recollect the main elements of the proposed dedicated measurement strategy that allow to\nreduce the systematic errors to the level shown in the shaded areas of Table 5.5 :\n4\n\nIn order to amplify this effect, we have kept the same central value of the intrinsic transverse momentum smearing\nin the reduced collision energy as for the nominal collision energy.\n\n\f154\n\nStrategy for a reduction of the systematic errors on MW+ \u2212 MW\u2212\n\n- The charge asymmetry method allows to reduce the impact of most of the systematic measurement errors, except for the relative momentum scale errors for the positive and negative\nleptons. If they cannot be experimentally controlled to the level of O(10\u22124 ), their impact can be\ndrastically reduced in the dedicated LHC running periods using the double charge asymmetry\nmethod.\n- The impact of the uncertainty in modeling of the intrinsic transverse momentum of the WBpB\ncan be reduced to a negligible level using the narrow bin measurement method.\n- The impact of the s \u2212 c uncertainty can be attenuated using the yW selection based method in\nnarrow bin.\n- Finally, the impact of the u(v) \u2212 d(v) uncertainty can be annihilated in the dedicated LHC runs\nwith light isoscalar beams.\n\n\f5.A Validation tests and miscellanea technical variations of the analysis\n\n5.A\n\n155\n\nValidation tests and miscellanea technical variations of the\nanalysis\nBuster : \"Actually, I'm studying cartography now, the mapping of uncharted\nterritories.\"\nMichael : \"Sure.

The points addressed are the following.\nThe first part presents trivial results carried using the observable \u03c1T,l to crosscheck the one made\nwith pT,l . Other trivial tests were made as well with pT,l -based distributions using shifted W masses in\nthe pseudo-data. The second part treats of the steadiness of the results with respect to certain input\nparameters for the analysis, such as the influence of the number of templates and their localisation\nwith respect to the \u03c72 minimum, the number of bins of the histograms, the window range for the\nanalysis and the emulation of E\n/ T cuts.\nIn the rest of this Appendix unless stated otherwise the tests are made preferentially using p p\ncollisions selected with the requirements shown in Eq. (5.6) and in the conventional range of 30 GeV <\npT,l < 50 GeV.\n\n5.A.1\n(a)\n\nDetails on the validation of the analysis framework\n\nCross check of the analysis using the observable \u03c1T,l\n\nSince the observable \u03c1T,l is booked at the time of the generation it is pertinent to cross check the\nframework with \u03c1T,l -based methods for the case of trivial (\u03be = 0) as well as non trivial (\u03be 6= 0)\ntests. Besides, this simple studies allows as well to get accustomed to the behaviour of the variable\n\u03c1T,l and Asym(+,\u2212) (\u03c1T,l ). Starting with that last remark, Figure. 5.7 presents in frames (a), (b)\nthe behaviour of the observable \u03c1T,l for : (1) the generated and unselected sample of events, (2) the\ngenerated and selected sample of events and (3) the unbiased simulated detector response and selected\nsample of events. In the each frame the range for the analysis 0.02 GeV < \u03c1T,l < 50 GeV \u2013equivalent\nto 30 GeV < pT,l < 50 GeV\u2013 is highlighted. Just like for the pT,l distribution we can see that the cuts\nare responsible of a drastic change in the behaviour of the \u03c1T,l spectrum in particular in the region of\nthe jacobian slope. In Fig. 5.7.(d) a trivial \u03c72 test was performed for an unbiased pseudo-data using\nAsym(+,\u2212) (\u03c1T,l ). As expected the value \u2206(+,\u2212) = 0 is found. The results for \u03be 6= 0 were found to\nbe in a complete agreement \u2013up to non avoidable numerical discrepancies\u2013 with the one provided by\npT,l -methods.\n(b)\n\nValidation using shifted mass for the W boson mass in the pseudo-data\n\nEven though the previous trivial tests were found to be relevant, as long as the \u2206(+,\u2212) = 0 value\ndoesn't have a sign it is \u2013so far\u2013 impossible to fully check the relevancy of the values. Also, the next\n(ref.)\nlogical step was to simulate unbiased pseudo-data but with shifted masses with respect to MW\nfor the boson and see if in the analysis we rediscover those shifts. Three tests were carried for that\npurpose using both classic and charge asymmetry methods. In each of these tests, the central values\nfor the masses of the W + and W \u2212 bosons were fixed for the generation of the pseudo-data to :\n(ref.)\n\nPD = M\n1. MW\n+\nW\n\n(ref.)\n\nPD = M\n2.

The two extrema MT\nsamples, MT min and MT max , have been drawn as well to enhance the deviation of the unbiased\nPD(\u03be = 0) with respect to the half way position between them. Starting with Fig. 5.8.(a), the\njacobian peak of the W + PD is slightly shifted to higher pT while the one for W \u2212 in frame (b) is\nhalf-way between the two MT . In frame (c), the charge asymmetry of pT,l is closer to the MT\nfor which \u2206(+,\u2212) = +200 MeV. This is understandable as in general beyond the jacobian peak (i.e.\npT,l > 40 GeV or \u03c1T,l < 0.025 GeV\u22121 in \u03c1T,l -space) the following equation holds\nd\u03c3\nda\n\n>\n(2)\n\nMW\n\nd\u03c3\nda\n\n,\n(1)\n\n(5.25)\n\n(2)\n\nMW <MW\n\nwhere a is to be replaced by pT,l or \u03c1T,l .

For the cases (2) and (3) of the previous item list the\nW bosons, that is MW\n+\nW\u2212\nresults where found to be relevant as well.\nLet us note that in the case of the pT,l+ and Asym(+,\u2212) (pT,l ) parabola the fact there are less\npoints in the vicinity of the parabola minimum does not decrease the degree of convergence of the\ncalculus. For non trivial analysis where \u03be 6= 0 we often observe shifts of such amplitude that most\nof the points are localised on one side only of the fitted parabola. Hence a question we can ask is at\nwhich point the small number of considered mass templates is sufficient to provide a relevant value.\nIn the next Subsection we investigate this issue by using the present pseudo-data for unbiased \u03c72\ntests.\n\n5.A.2\n(a)\n\nInfluence on the results of some input parameters to the analysis\n\nInfluence of the localisation and number of templates\n\nIn this part we consider the problem where the systematic error is such that there are no simulated\nmass templates having masses of the order of the systematic error. In other words we want to address\nthe problem where we have to perform of parabola fit with the points being far from the parabola\nminimum and localised in one side only of the minimum. For that purpose we consider the same\npseudo-data with \u03be = 0 than in the case (1) of the item list of the previous section, that is with\nPD = M (ref.) + 100 MeV, M PD = M (ref.) , M (ref.) = 80.403 MeV and use the charge asymmetry\nMW\n+\nW\nW\nW\nW\u2212\nmethod. This emulates in a good way the cases where \u2206(+,\u2212) (\u03be) \u001d 0 for \u03be 6= 0.\nTo sees at which point the localisation of the templates matters we reduce the range covered by\nthe templates to see at which level the convergence and \u2206(+,\u2212) value changes. The results are shown\nin Table. 5.6. Then we come to the conclusion that as long as the systematic errors \u2206(+,\u2212) are such\nthat |\u2206(+,\u2212) (\u03be)| < 200 MeV if the convergence is poor (\u03c72min /dof \u001d 1) it has to be blamed purely on\nthe distortion on the PD affected by the bias \u03be. On the other hand, for the cases where |\u2206(+,\u2212) (\u03be)| >\n200 MeV a bad convergence will always be observed because of the lack of mass templates which\neventually will provide values of \u2206(+,\u2212) which will differ from the one to be observed if having\ngenerated much more templates.\nNonetheless, with the chosen biases \u03be values and the analysis techniques developed most of the\nerrors \u2206(+,\u2212) are within the \u00b1 200 MeV range which justify why the extension of the range was not\nconsidered a vital problem to extract the essential physics from our analysis.\n(b)\n\nInfluence of the resolution of the histograms\n\nIn this part we considered changes to larger bins for the analysis with respect to the one used for\nthe generation to see at which level the bin width of the histograms is important. Let us remind the\nformer binning corresponded to a resolution of 200 MeV, which in the range of 20 GeV < pT,l < 60 GeV\ncorresponded to 200 bins.\n\n\f5.A Validation tests and miscellanea technical variations of the analysis\nNumber of bins\n\n(\u03c72\n\n/dof)\n\n159\n2\n\n\u03b4 pT [GeV]\n\nClassic \u2206(+,\u2212) (\u03c72+,min /dof)\n\n200\n\n0.2\n\n0.8 \u00b1 5.8 (0.98)\n\n(0.86)\n\n1.2 \u00b1 4.1 (0.82)\n\n100\n\n0.4\n\n0.9 \u00b1 5.7 (1.10)\n\n(0.94)\n\n1.3 \u00b1 4.1 (0.95)\n\n50\n\n0.8\n\n1.0 \u00b1 5.8 (1.06)\n\n(0.97)\n\n1.5 \u00b1 4.1 (0.90)\n\n25\n\n1.6\n\n1.2 \u00b1 5.7 (1.23)\n\n(1.02)\n\n1.9 \u00b1 4.1 (0.96)\n\n\u2212,min\n\nCharge Asymmetry \u2206(+,\u2212) (\u03c7min /dof)\n\nTable 5.7: Influence of the binning of the histograms for the likelihood analysis.

The procedure for the likelihood test between the pseudodata PD(\u03be = 0) and the nth. -mass template MT (n) was done in two steps : (1) PD and MT (n)\nhistograms were re-binned to a lower resolution, (2) the likelihood analysis was carried out, i.e. the\ntwo histograms are cut to the standard analysis window of 30 GeV < pT,l < 50 GeV and then the \u03c72\ntest was done.\nTable 5.7 shows the influence of different \u03b4 pT resolutions for the charged lepton on the \u03c72 results\nwhile Figure 5.9 present pT,l+ and Asym(+,\u2212) (pT,l ) spectra with a resolution of \u03b4 pT \u2248 0.8 GeV.\n(a) \u2212\n\n(b) \u2212 PD(\u03be = 0) & MT max/min of Asym(+,\u2212) (pT,l )\n\nP D (\u03be = 0) & MT max/min of pT ,l+\n\n0.20\n\n0.15\n0.4\n\nAsym(+,\u2212)(pT,l )\n\nd \u03c3/d pT,l + [nb/GeV]\n\n0.5\n\n0.3\n0.2\n\n0.10\n\n0.05\nPD(\u03be = 0) : \u2206(+,\u2212) = 0\nMT min\n: \u2206min\n(+,\u2212) = \u2212200 MeV\nMT max\n: \u2206max\n(+,\u2212) = +200 MeV\n\n0.1\n0.0\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\npT,l + [GeV]\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n0.00\n\nPD(\u03be = 0) : \u2206(+,\u2212) = 0\nMT\n: \u2206min\n(+,\u2212) = \u2212200 MeV\nMT\n: \u2206max\n(+,\u2212) = +200 MeV\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\npT,l [GeV]\n\n45\n\n50\n\nFigure 5.9: Pseudo-data and extrema mass templates pT,l+ (a) and Asym(+,\u2212) (pT,l ) (b) histograms for a resolution\nof \u03b4pT = 0.8 GeV.\n\n(c)\n\nInfluence of the window in pT,l\n\nWe look now at the influence of the window for the \u03c72 analysis. Enlarging the range at low and high\npT would imply in reality to test the sensibility of the charge asymmetry observable as a mean to\nextract the W mass respectively toward the modeling of the low pT background differences between\nthe W + and the W \u2212 production and the influence of the \u0393W and/or \u0393W + 6= \u0393W \u2212 in the high pT\nregion.\nIn the first step the high pT,l is maintained at 50 GeV. Then, taking the minimum value of 20 GeV\n\n\u2022\n\n\f\u2022\n\n160\n\nStrategy for a reduction of the systematic errors on MW+ \u2212 MW\u2212\n\nfor the low cut we found for trivial results using the charge asymmetry of pT,l :\n20 GeV < pT,l < 50 GeV\n\n\u21d2\n\n\u2206(+,\u2212) (\u03be = 0) = 1.3 \u00b1 4.1 (with \u03c72min /dof = 0.84),\n\n(5.27)\n\nwhich does not enhance the former result seen in Eq. (5.15). Now, considering the whole range used\nfor the pT,l+ and pT,l\u2212 histograms, still using the charge asymmetry Asym(+,\u2212) (pT,l ) we find :\n20 GeV < pT,l < 60 GeV\n\n\u21d2\n\n\u2206(+,\u2212) (\u03be = 0) = 1.1 \u00b1 3.9 (with \u03c72min /dof = 0.87),\n\n(5.28)\n\nthat is here we have a slightly better result.\nSince the results do not change a lot this would eventually allow by first reducing the lower cut\non pT to see the influence of the different background contributions in the positive and negative\nchannels. Note that the lower cut should not be too close from the trigger cut to avoid the possible\ncharge dependency from the selection process. On the other hand, maintaining the lower cut fixed\nand exploring higher pT cuts would allow now to study the influence of the W boson width on the\nresults.\n(d)\n\nInfluence of p\n/T,\u03bdl cuts\n\nThe influence of the E\n/ T cut was investigated with the best emulation achievable in our framework,\nthat is during the generation process in top of the requirements from Eq. (5.6), the simulated events\nwere selected if and only if the decaying neutrino displays pT,\u03bdl > 20 GeV. All \u03c72 (\u03be = 0 and \u03be 6= 0),\nup to non avoidable numerical discrepancies, were of the same values than the data gathered without\ndoing any cut on the neutrino.\nJust to cite two numbers, the Monte Carlo truth test gave :\n\u2206(+,\u2212) (\u03be = 0) = \u22121.0 \u00b1 3.3 MeV\n\nwith \u03c72min /dof = 0.98,\n\n(5.29)\n\nwhile the unbiased experimental test gave :\n\u2206(+,\u2212) (\u03be = 0) = 1.0 \u00b1 4 MeV\n\nwith \u03c72min /dof = 0.81.\n\n(5.30)\n\nBoth of these values are very close to the one present in Table 5.4. This justified for the rest of the\nstudy the non necessity to take care of such cuts.\n\n\f5.B Measurement of the W mass charge asymmetry : the How Not To\n\n5.B\n\n161\n\nMeasurement of the W mass charge asymmetry : the How Not\nTo\n\"That's not right. It's not even wrong.\"\nWolfgang Pauli's words of wisdom\n(Kept alive nowadays by M.W.K.)\n\nWe consider a particular context to extract MW + \u2212 MW \u2212 that stresses the charge asymmetry\nbetween the pT,l+ and pT,l\u2212 distributions at the LHC. For that matter we propose to assume just for\na moment that we are not aware of the V \u2212 A coupling of W bosons to fermions in the Standard\nModel and that the W + and W \u2212 , which are particle and antiparticle of each other provide positively\nand negatively decaying charged leptons with the same kinematics. Putting aside the fact that the\ndetector measurement are different between positively and negatively charged leptons we consider\nthe extraction of MW + \u2212 MW \u2212 could be obtained directly by confronting the data from one charge\nto mass templates generated for the opposite charge.\nTo be more precise, the data is here represented by Monte Carlo pseudo-data simulations of the\nW + confronted via \u03c72 likelihood tests with Monte Carlo simulations of the W \u2212 bosons. Unaware\nof the V \u2212 A coupling and of all its consequences seen in Chapter 4 one would expect that in this\nconfiguration a trivial \u03c72 test with unbiased W + pseudo-data should give MW + \u2212 MW \u2212 = 0 with a\ngood convergence (\u03c72min /dof \u2248 1).\nFigure 5.10 shows the \u03c72 test using the unbiased pseudo-data of the pT,l+ distribution and using\npT,l\u2212 for the mass templates (covering here the range \u00b1 500 MeV). The result obtained is \u03c72min /dof \u2248\n14, 000 and MW + \u2212 MW \u2212 \u2248 2.3 GeV. The poor quality of this result can be understood using the\narguments from the previous Appendix : the number of MT is too small and far from the expected\nparabola minimum. Nonetheless as we saw the order is still more or less correct and gives an idea\nof the size of the error, hence here we can say that going to such a naive test imply an error of the\norder of the GeV which is completely ruled out by the actual measurements as seen in Table 1.2.\nn\no\nPD(W +; \u03be = 0) \u2190 \u03c72 \u2192 MT (n)(W \u2212)\n\n2500000\n\n2250000\n\n\u03c72\n\n2000000\n\n1750000\n\n1500000\n\n\u22121000\n\n0\n\n1000\n\n2000\n\n3000\n\nMW + \u2212 MW \u2212 [MeV]\n\n4000\n\n5000\n\nFigure 5.10: \u03c72 results when considering the unbiased (\u03be = 0) pseudo-data built from the positive charged lepton\ndata and the mass templates built from the negatively charged lepton data\n\n\u2022\n\n\f\u2022\n\n162\n\nStrategy for a reduction of the systematic errors on MW+ \u2212 MW\u2212\n\n\f5.C Step-by-step interpretations of systematic errors results\n\n5.C\n\n163\n\nStep-by-step interpretations of systematic errors results\nReggie : \"Trucks come in and out of here all day long.

More precisely, each systematic error is now\ngiven with a precision of 0.1 MeV along with the associated \u03c72min /dof value providing then further\ndetails on the degree of convergence of the calculus.\nBesides, as explained previously, different random numbers sets were used for each event generation to emulate as better as possible uncorrelated events. For that purpose 100 independent seeds\nset were produced and tagged from set number 00 to set number 99. Practically the generation of\n\u2248 108 events needed to be achieved by splitting each generation into several sub-generations. Each\nsub-generation were produced so that all the 100 \u00d7 ns seeds were different to ensure the best possible\nun-correlation between different event batches. For the standard generation of one year of low luminosity, each W generation were split in average to 10 sub-generations, hence we used here ns = 20.\nConcerning the generation in the narrow lepton pseudo-rapidity or W boson rapidity region this time\neach W generation were split in average into 50 hence here ns = 100.\nThe seeds tags used for producing each pseudo-data PD will be as well displayed in the tables,\nthe one for the W + being labeled \"(+)\" each time written in top of the one used for W \u2212 labeled\n\"(\u2212)\".

The\nplots above in Fig. 5.11 illustrate the consequences of coherent biases between the positively and\nnegatively charged lepton reconstructed tracks. Fig. 5.11.(a) represents several distributions of the\ntransverse momentum of the l+ lepton. For the sake of clarity, only three mass templates MT from\nthe entire collection have been drawn, the minimum template (\u03b4 MW + = \u2212200 MeV), the central\none (\u03b4 MW + = 0 MeV) and the maximum one (\u03b4 MW + = +200 MeV). Although the histograms are\nconsidered for the analysis in the range of 30 GeV < pT,l < 50 GeV, a zoom was made on the jacobian\npeaks to make it possible to resolve by the eye the differences between the three MT . In top of\nthese histograms the PD histograms corresponding to \u03b5l+ = \u22120.05 % and \u03b5l+ = \u00b10.05 % are shown.\nFor such values the deviation from \u2206cen\n(+,\u2212) is hardly decipherable. Fig. 5.11.(b) shows the exact same\nthing than in (a) but this time for the negative lepton. Fig. 5.11.(c) represents the charge asymmetry\ncen \u2261 0 MeV), minimum MT (\u2206min\nof pT,l for its central MT (\u03b4MW\n+\n(+,\u2212) \u2261 \u2212200 MeV) and maximum\n\n\f5.C Step-by-step interpretations of systematic errors results\n\n169\n\nMT (\u2206max\n(+,\u2212) \u2261 +200 MeV). Are also present the two PD for which \u03b5l+ = \u03b5l\u2212 = \u00b10.05 %. Note here\nthat the difference between the MT is much more magnified which is directly associated with the\nfact that the charge asymmetry, by its form, get rid of the common features from both pT,l+ and\npT,l\u2212 histograms and as a consequence emphasise the discrepancies among them. Note also that to\ndecipher between the points of the two different PD, in each distribution a point is being skipped.\nFig. 5.11.(d) presents the \u03c72 results for both classic and charge asymmetry methods for the case of\n\u03b5l+ = \u03b5l\u2212 = 0.05 %. As seen in Table 5.9 both errors are quite steady with respect to the considered\nvalue of |\u03b5l | = 0.05 %, nonetheless the convergence for the charge asymmetry method is slightly better\nthan for the classic method.\n\n(a) \u2212 pT,l + for \u03b5l+ \u00b1 0.5 %\n\n(b) \u2212 pT,l \u2212 for \u03b5l\u2212 = \u00b10.5 %\n0.4\n\nd \u03c3/d pT,l \u2212 [nb/GeV]\n\nd \u03c3/d pT,l + [nb/GeV]\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\nMT\nMT\nMT\nPD\nPD\n\n0.2\n\ncen\n: \u03b4MW\n+\nmin\n: \u03b4MW\n+\nmax\n: \u03b4MW\n+\n: \u03b5l+ = +0.5 %\n: \u03b5l+ = \u22120.5 %\n\n36\n\n0.18\n\n38\n\n40\n\npT,l + [GeV]\n\n42\n\n0.3\n\nMT\nMT\nMT\nPD\nPD\n\n0.2\n\n44\n\ncen\n: \u03b4MW\n\u2212\nmin\n: \u03b4MW\n\u2212\nmax\n: \u03b4MW\n\u2212\n: \u03b5l\u2212 = +0.5 %\n: \u03b5l\u2212 = \u22120.5 %\n\n36\n\n(c) \u2212 Asym(+,\u2212) (pT,l ) , \u03b5l+ = \u03b5l\u2212 = \u00b10.5 %\n\n38\n\n40\n\npT,l \u2212 [GeV]\n\n44\n\n(d) \u2212 \u03c72 results for \u03b5l+ = \u03b5l\u2212 = 0.5 %\n\n7000\n\n\u03c72 (pT,l + )\n(pT,l \u2212 )\n\u03c72 \u0010\n\u0011\n\u03c72 Asym(+,\u2212) (pT,l )\n\n6000\n0.16\n5000\n0.14\n\n4000\n\n\u03c72\n\nAsym(+,\u2212) (pT,l )\n\n42\n\n3000\n\n0.12\n\nMT : \u2206cen\n(+,\u2212)\nMT : \u2206min\n(+,\u2212)\nMT : \u2206max\n(+,\u2212)\n\n0.10\n\n0.08\n\n2000\n1000\n\nPD : \u03b5l+ = \u03b5l\u2212 = +0.5 %\nPD : \u03b5l+ = \u03b5l\u2212 = \u22120.5 %\n30\n\n32\n\n34\n\n36\n\n38\n\n40\n\ndof = 100\n\n42\n\npT,l [GeV]\n\n44\n\n46\n\n48\n\n50\n\n0\n\u2212500\n\n\u2212400\n\n\u2212300\n\n\u2212200\n\n\u2212100\n\n0\n\n\u2206M [MeV]\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\nFigure 5.12: Systematic error on MW + \u2212 MW \u2212 due to coherent energy scale biases (\u03b5l = \u00b10.5 %) between the\n\npositively and negatively charged lepton reconstructed transverse momenta and for both classic and charge asymmetry\nmethods.

Indeed, starting with Fig. 5.12.(a)\nthe jacobian peaks of the PD are slightly shifted to higher pT for \u03b5l = \u22120.5 % and to lower pT for\n\u03b5l = 0.5 %. This can seem quite non intuitive but let us remind the biases are applied to \u03c1T,l , the\n(rec.)\ninverse of pT,l , hence as long as \u03b5l \u001c 1, the bias on pT,l can be deduced at first order from the\n\n\u2022\n\n\f170\n\nStrategy for a reduction of the systematic errors on MW+ \u2212 MW\u2212\n(rec.)\n\nexpression of \u03c1T,l\n\n:\n(rec.)\n\n\u03c1T,l\n\n(true)\n\n= \u03c1T,l\n\n(1 + \u03b5l )\n\n(rec.)\n\n\u21d2\n\npT,l\n\n(true)\n\n= pT,l\n\n(1 \u2212 \u03b5l ) ,\n\n(5.31)\n\njustifying the inverse behaviour between \u03c1T,l and pT,l biases. Then, considering for example the case\nof \u03b5l = \u22120.5 %, in both Figs. 5.12.(a) and (b) the jacobian peaks of the PD being shifted to lower pT\nPD and M PD are underestimated by \u2248 300 MeV as seen in frame (c). Nonetheless, since these\nboth MW\n+\nW\u2212\nbiases are coherent the impact on MW + \u2212 MW \u2212 is of the order of 16 MeV only. The low convergences\n\u03c72min /dof \u2248 30 is due to the lack of enough mass templates. In Fig. 5.12.(c) the charge asymmetry\nof pT,l the two PD show more steadiness than the bare pT,l spectra. Again for the sake of clarity in\neach PD distribution one point is being skipped each time.

Frame (d) presents the \u03c72 results for both charge and\ndouble charge asymmetry methods for the case of \u03b5l+ = \u03b5l\u2212 = 0.05 %.\n\nThe incoherent biases for the energy scale between the positive and negative charged lepton is\nnow addressed starting with Fig. 5.13 that considers the case of \u03b5l+ = \u2212\u03b5l\u2212 = \u00b10.05 %. This time the\nclassic method is no longer treated since the \u03c72 are too much out of charts. Instead the charge and\ndouble charge asymmetry are confronted. First, Fig. 5.13.(a) shows the charge asymmetry of pT,l for\n\n\f5.C Step-by-step interpretations of systematic errors results\n\n171\n\nthe usual central and extrema MT and the two PD biased by energy scales of \u03b5l+ = \u2212\u03b5l\u2212 = \u00b10.05 %.\nIn Fig. 5.13.(b) the same data is drawn in function of \u03c1T,l since it is in that space the \u03c72 is performed.\nUnlike the \"coherent biases\" here the PD deviation from the central MT are such that in (d) the\nsystematic error are quite important, more precisely of the order of \u00b150 MeV. Now in Fig. 5.13.(c)\nthe case of the double charge asymmetry is considered in the \u03c1T,l space. The MT are exactly the\nsame than the one used in (b), and the pseudo-data shows the cases where \u03b5l+ = \u2212\u03b5l\u2212 = 0.05 %\nduring the first year of the data collection and \u03b5l+ = \u2212\u03b5l\u2212 = \u22120.05 % for the second half of the year\ndue to the reversing of the solenoidal magnetic field of the tracker. Averaging the two data batches\nfrom the two six months period gives eventually a data collection which is localised near the central\nMT . The consequence can be seen in Fig. 5.13.(d), the double charge asymmetry is robust against\nsuch incoherent biases.\nFinally, the \"incoherent biases\" are considered for \u03b5l+ = \u2212\u03b5l\u2212 = \u00b10.5 % as shown in Fig. 5.14.\nHere we can see the biased data are completely different from the templates. Nonetheless, for the\ndouble charge asymmetry the average of the two \"six-months-data\" gives again a total pseudo-data\nbatch centered on the central MT distribution. Then, once again, the systematic error is still\nnegligible for the double charge asymmetry while the charge asymmetry is not sufficient to draw any\nconclusion.\n\n(a) \u2212 Asym(+,\u2212) (pT,l ) , \u03b5l+ = \u2212\u03b5l\u2212 = \u00b10.5 %\n\n0.18\n\n0.18\n\n0.16\n0.14\n\nAsym(+,\u2212) (\u03c1T,l )\n\nAsym(+,\u2212) (pT,l )\n\n0.16\n0.14\n0.12\nMT : \u2206cen\n(+,\u2212)\n\n0.10\n\nMT : \u2206min\n(+,\u2212)\nMT : \u2206max\n(+,\u2212)\n\n0.08\n\n32\n\n34\n\n36\n\n0.10\n0.08\nMT : \u2206cen\n(+,\u2212)\n\n0.06\n\nMT : \u2206min\n(+,\u2212)\nMT : \u2206max\n(+,\u2212)\n\n38\n\n40\n\nPD : \u03b5l+ = \u2212\u03b5l\u2212 = +0.5 %\nPD : \u03b5l+ = \u2212\u03b5l\u2212 = \u22120.5 %\n\n0.02\n42\n\npT,l [GeV]\n\n44\n\n46\n\n48\n\n0.00\n\n50\n\n(c) \u2212 (Asym)DAsym(+,\u2212) (\u03c1T,l )\n\n0.020\n\n0.025\n\n0.030\n\n\u03c1T,l [GeV\u22121]\n\n(d) \u2212 \u03c72 results for \u03b5l+ = \u2212\u03b5l\u2212 = \u00b10.05 %\n25000\n\n0.16\n0.14\n\n20000\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u03c72 Asym(+,\u2212) (\u03c1T,l )\n: \u03b5l+ = \u2212\u03b5l\u2212 = +0.05 %\n\u0010\n\u0011\n(+,\u2212)\n2\n(\u03c1T,l )\n: \u03b5l+ = \u2212\u03b5l\u2212 = \u22120.05 %\n\u03c7 Asym\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u03c72 DAsym(+,\u2212) (\u03c1T,l )\n\n0.12\n0.10\n\n\u03c72\n\n(Asym)DAsym(+,\u2212) (\u03c1T,l )\n\n0.12\n\n0.04\n\nPD : \u03b5l+ = \u2212\u03b5l\u2212 = +0.5 %\nPD : \u03b5l+ = \u2212\u03b5l\u2212 = \u22120.5 %\n\n30\n\n0.18\n\n(b) \u2212 Asym(+,\u2212) (\u03c1T,l ) , \u03b5l+ = \u2212\u03b5l\u2212 = \u00b10.5 %\n\n15000\n\n0.08\nMT\nMT\nPD\nPD\nPD\n\n0.04\n0.02\n0.00\n\n10000\n\nMT : \u2206cen\n(+,\u2212)\n\n0.06\n\n0.020\n\n: \u2206min\n(+,\u2212)\n: \u2206max\n\u0002 (+,\u2212)\n\u0003\n: (1st half year) + (2nd half year) /2\n: \u03b5l+ = \u2212\u03b5l\u2212 = +0.5 % (1st half year)\n: \u03b5l+ = \u2212\u03b5l\u2212 = \u22120.5 % (2nd half year)\n\n0.025\n\n\u03c1T,l [GeV\u22121]\n\n5000\n\n0.030\n\n= 49\n0 dof \u2212750\n\u22121000\n\n\u2212500\n\n\u2212250\n\n0\n\n250\n\nMW + \u2212 MW \u2212 [MeV]\n\n500\n\n750\n\n1000\n\nFigure 5.14: Systematic error on MW + \u2212 MW \u2212 due to incoherent energy scale biases (\u03b5l = \u00b10.5 %) for both charge\n\nand double charge asymmetry methods.

The value ERF = 0.7 tends to narrow the bare pT,l distribution\nwhile having ERF = 1.3, by widening this time the width of the Gaussian response, tends to smear\nthe sharpness of the distributions. Starting with the classic method we see that no matter which\nvalue is used here the bias on the intrinsic determination of MW + and MW \u2212 , and as a consequence\non MW + \u2212MW \u2212 , is not very strong. We can note though that here in top of shifting the unbiased bare\nspectra to different pT the widening/narrowing change locally the normalisation. The consequence is\nthat without any other technical refinement the PD can hardly apparent itself to any of the histogram.\nAlso, even though the impact is negligible on the mass determination the convergence is very low,\ni.e. \u03c72min /dof \u2248 20. In the frame (c) the charge asymmetry shows, no matter the used ERF values\ngood steadiness and stays again in the vicinity of the central MT .

The narrow selection on \u03b7l shows only a slight enhancement while the use of d d\ncollisions, even with an acceptance of |\u03b7l | < 2.5, remove the ambiguities on the valence PDF errors.\nThis can be understood quite easily looking at the impact of the modeled systematic error on\nthe production of a W + and a W \u2212 for both p p and d d collisions. In the first case, for p p collision\nwe consider the W + and W \u2212 are respectively produced via u(v) d \u0304 \u2192 W + and d(v) \u016b \u2192 W \u2212 . Making explicit the expressions of the biased valence distributions in functions of the LHAPDF (LHA)\npredictions gives\n\u0010\n\u0011\np,(v)\np,(v)\n \u0304\nW + : ubiased d \u0304 =\nuL + \u03b4 d,\n(5.32)\n\u0010\n\u0011\np,(v)\np,(v)\nW \u2212 : dbiased \u016b =\ndL \u2212 \u03b4 \u016b,\n(5.33)\n\nwhere \u03b4 is the error on the PDF we've been introducing by hand. In this configuration we observe\nincoherent shift between the production of W + and W \u2212 . Now, for d d collisions we explicit this time\nthe biased valence ud,(v) and dd,(v) expressions having in mind that in a neutron n we have un = dp\nand dn = up .

It presented\na brand new dedicated strategy for the precision measurement of the charge asymmetry of the W\nboson mass specific to the LHC collider physics.\nThis measurement must, in our view, precede the measurement of the charge averaged mass of\nthe W boson and the measurement of sin \u03b8W , in order to diminish the risk of false absorption of\nvariety of unknown Beyond Standard Model effects within the Standard Model parameter space.\nThis measurement is of particular importance for the following two reasons. Firstly, at the LHC \u2013\ncontrary to the Tevatron p p\u0304 collider \u2013 we have seen the measurement of the averaged mass of the\nW boson cannot be dissociated from the measurement of the masses of its charge states. Secondly,\nthe precision of verification of the charge universality of the Fermi coupling constant GF , measured\nvia the charge asymmetry of the muon life time, must be matched by the precision of verification of\nthe charge universality of the SU (2) coupling strength gW . This can be achieved only if the mass\ndifference MW + \u2212 MW \u2212 can be determined with the precision of a few MeV, i.e. a factor of \u223c 20\nbetter than the best present measurement.\nThe Tevatron p p\u0304 collision scheme, as far as the systematic and modeling errors are concerned,\nis better suited for the precision measurement of the W boson charge asymmetry. However, even\nif dedicated strategies, as e.g. those proposed in this document are used, the measurement will be\nlimited by the statistical precision, affecting both the W boson samples and, more importantly, the\nZ boson calibration sample.\nAt the LHC the requisite statistical precision can be achieved already for the integrated luminosity\nof 10 fb\u22121 , i.e. in the first year of the LHC operation at the \"low\", O(1033 cm\u22122 s\u22121 ), luminosity.\nHowever, in order to achieve a comparable systematic precision in an analysis based on the calibration\nand measurement strategies developed at the Tevatron, the charge dependent biases in the energy\n(momentum) scale of positive (negative) leptons must be controlled to the precision of 0.005 %.\nAs it was argued, it will be extremely hard, if not impossible, to achieve such a precision using\nthe calibration methods developed at the Tevatron. Moreover, we have identified the LHC-specific\nsources of errors, related to the uncertainties in the present knowledge of the flavour composition\nof the WBpB which limit, at present, the measurement precision to O(100 MeV). Certainly, this\nuncertainty will be reduced once the high statistic W boson and Z boson samples are collected.\nNevertheless, it will be hard, if not impossible, to improve by a factor of 10 or more the precision\nof the u(v) \u2013d(v) and s\u2013c quark-momentum distribution asymmetries, as they are hardly detectable\nin the Z-boson production processes. Whether or not the requisite precision target will be reached\nusing the standard measurement strategies remains to be seen. In our view, it will be indispensable\nto use the dedicated LHC-specific measurement strategies.\nThe strategy proposed and discussed here makes a full use of the flexibility of the machine and\n\n\f178\n\nConclusion\n\ndetector configurations which, we hope, will be exploited in the mature phase of the LHC experimental\nprogram. It requires : (1) running for a fraction of time the inverted polarity current in the detector\nsolenoid, (2) the dedicated trigger and data-acquisition configuration in the \"high\", O(1034 cm\u22122 s\u22121 ),\nluminosity LHC operation mode, and (3) replacing the LHC proton beams by light isoscalar ion\nbeams.\nThe underlying principle of the proposed dedicated strategy is that, instead of diminishing the\nsystematic measurement and modeling uncertainties, it minimizes their influence on the measured\nvalue of MW + \u2212 MW \u2212 . We have demonstrated that already for the modest (easy to fulfill) measurement and modeling precision requirements, the resulting uncertainty of MW + \u2212 MW \u2212 can be kept at\nthe level comparable to the statistical measurement uncertainty, i.e. at the level of O(5 MeV).\nIt remains to be demonstrated that the remaining systematic measurement errors, of secondary\nimportance at the Tevatron and not discussed here, could be neglected at this level of the measurement\nprecision. This can, however, be proved only when the real data are collected and analysed, both for\nthe standard and for the dedicated measurement strategies.\n\n\fList of
