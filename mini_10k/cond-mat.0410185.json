Introduction\nIntegral equations have become a popular and increasingly accurate tool in describing\nthe thermodynamics and the bulk structure of one\u2013component simple liquids and, to a\nsmaller degree of accuracy, of fluid mixtures. In the early, formal work (see references\n[1, 2, 3] and references therein) the structural ingredients (pair correlation function,\ndirect correlation function and bridge function) have been defined in terms of graphical\nexpansions and two exact equations relating these three functions have been established.\nThe unknown third equation which is necessary for a closed system of equations is\nusually referred to as the closure relation. A number of approximations have been\ndeveloped in the past for the closure relation. Some of the more succesful ones for the\nstructure and thermodynamics of a one\u2013component liquid are the optimized random\nphase approximation (ORPA) [4], the hierarchical reference theory (HRT) [5], the\nself\u2013consistent Ornstein\u2013Zernike approximation (SCOZA) [6], the Martynov\u2013Sarkisov\nclosure [7] and the reference hypernetted chain equations (RHNC) [8]. For a general\nintroduction into the subject treating some of these and other common closures, see\nreference [9]. The extension of integral equation theories to a general inhomogeneous\nsystem defined by an external potential (a wall, say) is possible by incorporating the\nsource of inhomogeneity as a second component in the dilute limit (the wall particle)\nand treating the originally inhomogeneous problem as a bulk (homogeneous) problem\nin the two\u2013component mixture. This generalization fails for all of the above closures\nwhenever the phenomenon of wetting in the presence of the external (wall) potential is\ninvolved.\nOn the one hand this failure is linked to the difficulties of defining the free energy\nand chemical potential accurately and consistently in the two\u2013component (wall\u2013fluid)\nmixture. Or, whenever a free energy approximation underlying a certain closure relation\ncan be formulated, its form does not allow for wetting. For example, it can be proved\nthat in the hard wall case the HNC and RHNC closures miss the phenomenon of complete\ndrying for the above reason (for HNC, the proof is given in reference [10] and it can be\neasily extended to RHNC). This problem was tackled tentatively in references [11, 12] in\nwhat is termed the hydrostatic HNC approach and this will be commented on in section\n3.3.\nOn the other hand, one is inclined to link this failure to the difficulty of\nincorporating the wall as a second component. As the formal framework embodied in the\ngraphical expansions holds equally well for a general inhomogeneous situation, one may\nabandon the mixture idea and study the one\u2013component fluid using the common closure\nrelations but now for the inhomogeneous correlation functions. These are defined in the\npresence of an external potential which necessarily entails a loss of symmetry for the\ncorrelation functions and thus results in a noticeable increase in computational power\nrequired for a numerical solution. Nevertheless, the problem of defining the chemical\npotential in the inhomogeneous situation still persists; for a review of possible solutions\nfor a range of commonly used closures see reference [13]. Away from phase transitions,\n\n\fIntegral equations for simple fluids in a general reference functional approach\n\n3\n\ninhomogeneous integral equation closures may give very accurate density profiles; for\nthe example of a fluid confined in a slit see reference [14]. However, systematic studies\nof wetting and drying phenomena within this approach have remained fragmentary, see\nreferences [15, 16, 17, 18]. Very recently and quite distinct from the usual closures, an\nimplementation of HRT for the inhomogeneous problem has been presented in reference\n[19].\nParallel to the development of integral equation approaches, density functional\nmodels have become established as a widespread tool for the investigation of\ninhomogeneous fluids and for the study of wetting phenomena, in particular. The first\nstudy of the latter using a 'modern' density functional theory has been reported in\nreference [20]; for a summary of the initial development of the field see reference [21]. In\ncontrast to integral equations, a very simple mean\u2013field type of functional (with a local\nand therefore actually quite inadequate treatment of the sharply repulsive interatomic\npotentials) predicts rich wetting phenomena at walls, see e.g. references [22, 23]. This\nis related to the underlying bulk equation of state which can be derived from the mean\u2013\nfield functional: it is a reasonable zeroth\u2013order approximation to the true equation of\nstate. The drawback of the simplest models of the type discussed in references [22, 23]\nconsists in their complete failure to describe realistically fluid correlation functions.\nThis is due to the inadequate treatment of the short\u2013range repulsive forces. By now\nthe treatment of short\u2013ranged correlations within hard sphere density functionals has\nreached a very satisfactory level of precision and internal consistency; for landmark\ndevelopments see references [24, 25, 26]. By contrast, the treatment of the attractive\ntails in the interatomic potentials has remained on the mean\u2013field level which leaves the\nequation of state treated in zeroth order approximation.\nIn order to relate density functional results in the presence of a wall, say, to\nquasi\u2013exact results as obtained from simulations, a number of methods have been\nproposed. First, one can observe that away from the critical region, density functional\nresults accurately reproduce simulation results if the mean\u2013field coexistence curve is\nappropriately scaled [27]. Second, close to exact correlation functions obtained from\nintegral equation methods may be used as input in density functionals, see references\n[28, 29, 30]. These amendments generally improve the agreement between density\nprofiles obtained from theory and simulation. However, by introducing these ad\u2013hoc\nmodifications some key properties of the basic functionals (hard sphere functional plus\nmean field treatment of attractions) are destroyed such as e.g. the compliance with the\nresults of exact sum rules. Additionally, if this modified class of density functionals\nis applied to reproduce the bulk fluid correlation functions (this so\u2013called test particle\nlimit is obtained by choosing the fluid interatomic potential as the external potential)\nthere is, in general, no agreement between the integral equation input and the density\nfunctional output.\nThis requirement of test particle consistency was the starting point for the density\nfunctional theory developed in [31] which tries to combine standard density functional\nand integral equation approaches more consistently. By making a Taylor expansion of\n\n\fIntegral equations for simple fluids in a general reference functional approach\n\n4\n\nthe free energy functional around bulk densities the standard bulk integral equations\nare derived and the bridge function in the bulk is determined via a density functional\nfor a suitably chosen reference system of hard spheres, thereby providing the necessary\nclosure relation. The latter resembles the RHNC closure. Results for the bulk structure\nof the one\u2013component plasma [32] and for a few state points of the Lennard\u2013Jones fluid\n[33] show a similar level of agreement (if not better) with simulation data as RHNC\nresults.\nIn this paper we will develop this idea, the reference functional approach, in\nmore detail, generalizing the method to an arbitrary inhomogeneous situation and also\nanalyzing bulk fluid and wall\u2013fluid correlations using the mixture description. We will\nsee that by introducing the reference functional insertion free energies (i.e., the chemical\npotential in the bulk) are obtained quite naturally. For the wall\u2013fluid problem treated\nin the bulk mixture approach this implies that the insertion free energy of the wall is\nexplicitly given; using it we can show that in the case of a hard wall complete drying is\npredicted.\nThe paper is structured as follows: In section 2 we consider a fluid mixture in\nan arbitrary inhomogeneous equilibrium state and derive a general closure for the\ncorresponding integral equations using the concept of the reference functional. This\npermits us to derive expressions for the insertion free energies corresponding to the\nchange in grand potential when inserting the mixture particles into the inhomogeneous\nequilibrium state. In section 3 we apply the approach to a mixture of a Lennard\u2013Jones\nfluid and hard particles. In the limit of infinite radius of the hard particles (upon\nwhich the particles become hard walls) and infinitely small hard particle density we\nsolve the equations for the fluid and wall\u2013fluid correlation functions. For the bulk fluid,\nwe find very good agreement with simulation for both the virial and internal energy\nequation of state. The liquid\u2013vapour coexistence curve is obtained by (i) the usual\nMaxwell construction and (ii) the requirement of complete drying at the hard wall.\nWe discuss the form of the wall\u2013fluid bridge function required to account for complete\ndrying. Furthermore, we consider the consistency of our theory by analyzing two sum\nrules appropriate to the density distributions at a hard wall. We discuss the relation of\nthe reference functional method to commonly used density functional mean field models.\nSection 4 contains a summary and perspectives for further research.\n2. Theory\nWe consider a liquid mixture which contains n components. The interaction potential\nbetween atoms of species i and j is given by uij (r) with r = |ri \u2212 rj | denoting\nthe distance between the two atoms (i, j = 1 . . . n). The ith element of the vector\n\u03c1(r) = {\u03c11 (r), . . . , \u03c1n (r)} describes the density distribution of species i and likewise\nthe ith element of the vector V(r) = {V1 (r), . . . , Vn (r)} denotes the external potential\nacting on an atom of species i. In equilibrium, there exists a unique correspondence\nbetween the external potential V(r) and the density distribution which we denote by \u03c1V\n\n\fIntegral equations for simple fluids in a general reference functional approach\n\n5\n\nto highlight this correspondence. As a consequence, there exists a unique free\u2013energy\nfunctional [34]\n= F id [\u03c1] + F ex [\u03c1]\nXZ\n\u0001\nid\n\u03b2F [\u03c1] =\ndr \u03c1i (r) log(\u03c1i (r)\u039b3i ) \u2212 1\nF [\u03c1]\n\n(1)\n(2)\n\ni\n\nwhich is usually split into the exactly known ideal part (containing the species\u2013specific\nde\u2013Broglie wavelength \u039bi ) and the excess contribution.

However, we may approximate F B by a density functional\nfor a reference system in the following manner:\nF B [\u03c1] \u2248 F B,ref [\u03c1] = F ref [\u03c1] \u2212 F HNC,ref [\u03c1] ,\n\n(23)\n\nwhere the second order HNC contribution is given by equation (8):\nXZ\n(1),i\nHNC,ref\nex,ref\ndr cref (r; \u03c1V )\u2206\u03c1i (r) \u2212\n\u03b2F\n[\u03c1] = \u03b2A\n(\u03c1V ) \u2212\ni\n\n1X\n2 ij\n\nZ\n\n(2),ij\n\ndr dr\u2032 cref (r, r\u2032 ; \u03c1V )\u2206\u03c1i (r)\u2206\u03c1j (r\u2032 ) ,\n\n(24)\n\n(1),i\n\n(2),ij\n\n\u2206A = F ex [\u03c1] \u2212 F ex,ref [\u03c1] = F HNC [\u03c1] \u2212 F HNC,ref [\u03c1]\nZ\n1X\n(1),i\ndr (c(1),i \u2212 cref )(r; \u03c1V )\u2206\u03c1i (r) \u2212\n= const. \u2212\n\u03b2 i\nZ\n1 X\n(2),ij\ndr dr\u2032 (c(2),ij \u2212 cref )(r, r\u2032; \u03c1V )\u2206\u03c1i (r)\u2206\u03c1j (r\u2032 ) .\n2\u03b2 ij\n\n(25)\n\nFor an explicitly given functional F ref , the direct correlation functions cref and cref\nare obtained through equation (5). The reference functional approximation implies that\nall direct correlations beyond second order are well approximated by the corresponding\ndirect correlations of the reference system. Equivalently, it states that the contributions\nto the excess free energy beyond those of the reference system are of second order in the\ndensity difference \u2206\u03c1,\n\n(26)\n\n\fIntegral equations for simple fluids in a general reference functional approach\n\n9\n\nThus the reference functional approximation defines a kind of a generalized mean\u2013field\napproximation in treating a general fluid beyond a given reference system where the\n(2),ij\ncoefficient in the quadratic term, c(2),ij \u2212 cref , is determined self\u2013consistently.\nIn practice, there are only three reference systems for which we possess reasonably\naccurate density functionals. They are all related to hard\u2013sphere systems where we\ncan use geometric arguments for their construction. These encompass (i) functionals of\nRosenfeld type for hard\u2013sphere mixtures (see e.g. references [25, 26]), (ii) a functional\nfor the Asakura\u2013Oosawa colloid\u2013polymer mixture [36], and (iii) a recently proposed\nfunctional for non\u2013additive hard\u2013sphere mixtures [37]. The functionals of type (i) have\nbeen tested in a variety of inhomogeneous situations and can be regarded as very robust.\nThe functional (ii) has been applied to the structure of free interfaces and near a hard\nwall, predicting a wealth of interesting phenomena [36]. A drawback is that the polymers\nare treated only linearly in their density, consequently correlations from the functional\nare deficient if they are sensitive to higher orders in the polymer density. The functional\n(iii) has not been tested yet for inhomogeneous situations. It contains the functional\nfor the Asakura\u2013Oosawa model as a limiting case, so similar merits and problems may\nbe expected there.\nSummarizing the literature which is concerned with the reference functional idea,\nwe note that the formalism presented above has been formulated previously only for\nfunctionals of type (i) and for functional expansions around bulk densities \u03c10 , i.e.\nV = 0. In fact, the reference functional approximation as expressed by equation (23)\nwas introduced in reference [31] and used to describe the one\u2013component plasma with\nhigh accuracy and its similarity to the reference HNC equations was also pointed out.\nLater on, the numerical efficacy of this idea was illustrated for a few state points of the\none\u2013component Lennard\u2013Jones (LJ) fluid [33] and of binary mixtures with their size\nasymmetry being not too large [38]. Comparison with simulation results for both the\ncorrelation functions and thermodynamic properties shows very good agreement.\nAlthough the hard sphere functionals of type (i) are very robust, they are not\nexact. For example, the bulk direct correlation function obtained from the functionals\nby direct functional differentiation, equation (5), represent good approximations for its\nbehaviour inside the hard core but predict it to be zero outside. In order to improve\nupon the accuracy of the correlation functions, the reference functional method may\nbe applied to the hard sphere reference system itself. As a result, for one\u2013component\nhard spheres the bridge function for the bulk integral equations generated by using the\nWhite Bear functional of reference [26] appears to be the most accurate one known\nup to now. Applied to binary hard\u2013sphere mixtures and size asymmetries > 10, the\nbulk integral equation closure shows deficiencies in calculating the distribution function\nbetween the big spheres [39]. This may be related to the inadequacy of the functional\nTaylor expansion around bulk densities for large size asymmetries or to the inadequacy\nof the functionals themselves (as manifest in a low\u2013density analysis of the third\u2013order\ndirect correlation function c(3) [40]).\nThe advantage of the present formalism is that for a general, inhomogeneous density\n\n\f10\n\nIntegral equations for simple fluids in a general reference functional approach\n\ndistribution \u03c1V it is possible to determine directly insertion free energies using equation\n(19). Of much interest is e.g. obtaining the insertion free energy for colloids at fluid\ninterfaces which determines their adsorption behaviour at the interface. However, a\nnumerical solution of equations (12)\u2013(15) requires large numerical efforts. Functional\nminimization in two or three dimensions is complicated by the nature of the three types\nof functionals mentioned above; these contain \u03b4 and \u03b8\u2013like distributions.\nIn this paper, we confine ourselves to an illustration of the approach for a simple\none\u2013component fluid and for V = 0. On the one hand, the solution to the homogeneous\nOrnstein\u2013Zernike equation with the integral equation closure defined by equation (13)\ngives the pressure p(\u03c1) and the chemical potential \u03bc(\u03c1) for a fixed temperature via the\nvirial equation of state and equation (21), respectively. This permits the determination\nof the liquid\u2013vapour coexistence curve via a standard Maxwell construction as is usually\ndone in integral equation theories. On the other hand, by considering a binary mixture of\nthe fluid with hard spherical cavities in the limit of vanishing cavity density and infinite\ncavity radius we can derive a wall\u2013particle integral equation. The onset of complete\ndrying at the planar hard wall (the cavity with infinite radius) permits an independent\ndetermination of the coexistence curve. We examine the degree of consistency between\nthese two different routes.\n3. Application: Equation of state for a simple fluid and drying at a hard\nwall\nWe consider a binary mixture of cut\u2013off and shifted Lennard\u2013Jones particles (species 1)\nwith hard cavities of radius Rc (species 2).

In the limit \u03c12,0 \u2192 0 (\u03c11,0 \u2261 \u03c10 ) the equations for h11 \u2261 h\nand c(2),11 \u2261 c(2) (fluid correlations) and h12 (cavity\u2013fluid correlation) decouple. The\nintegral equation system for the LJ fluid (cf. equations (12) and (13)) is given by:\nlog g(r) + \u03b2u11 (r) = h(r) \u2212 c(2) (r) \u2212 \u03b2\nh(r) \u2212 c(2) (r)\n\n\u03b4F B,ref\n\u03b4\u03c1(r)\n\n,\n\n(31)\n\n\u03c1(r)=\u03c10 g(r)\n\n= \u03c10 h \u2217 c(2) (r)\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ\n(2)\n\u2032 (2)\n\u2032\n\u2032\nh \u2217 c (r) = dr c (r \u2212 r ) h(r ) ,\n\n(32)\n(33)\n\n\fIntegral equations for simple fluids in a general reference functional approach\n\n11\n\nwith g(r) \u2261 g(r) etc. Following the reference functional assumption, F B has been\nreplaced by the corresponding functional for the reference system, cf. equation (23),\nand the fluid bridge function is given by\nb(r) = \u03b2\n\n\u03b4F B,ref\n\u03b4\u03c1(r)\n\n.\n\n(34)\n\n\u03c1(r)=\u03c10 g(r)\n\nUsing the Ornstein\u2013Zernike equation in the limit \u03c12,0 \u2192 0 in equation (13) yields a\nsingle equation for the cavity\u2013particle correlation which, however, needs as input the\nsolution for c(2) , the pair direct fluid correlation function:\nlog g 12 (r) + \u03b2u12 (r) = \u03c10 h12 \u2217 c(2) (r) \u2212 \u03b2\n\n\u03b4F B,ref\n\u03b4\u03c1(r)\n\n.\n\n(35)\n\n\u03c1(r)=\u03c10 g 12 (r)\n\nIn taking the planar hard wall limit Rc \u2192 \u221e, we shift the origin of the coordinate system\nsuch that limRc \u2192\u221e exp(\u2212\u03b2u12 (r)) = \u03b8(z). In this limit, the cavity\u2013fluid correlation\nfunctions will be referred to as the wall\u2013fluid correlation functions.\nNote that in the dilute limit \u03c12,0 \u2192 0 both the system of equations (31), (32)\nand equation (35) can be derived directly from minimization of the grand potential\nemploying the excess free energy functional of the one\u2013component LJ fluid, F HNC [\u03c1(r)]+\nF B,ref [\u03c1(r); d1 ], and using u11 and u12 , respectively, as external potentials. Consequently,\nthe reference functional F B,ref is derived from the one\u2013component Rosenfeld functional\nand contains only one unknown parameter, the hard\u2013sphere diameter d1 .\nBoth equations (31) and (35) are similar to the reference HNC closure [8]. There, the\nbridge function is approximated directly by the bridge function of the reference system\nwhereas here the bridge function is obtained from the reference system free energy\nfunctional. For state points near the triple point, both prescriptions agree with each\nother closely. However, in reference HNC the fluid bridge function remains short\u2013ranged\nnear the bulk critical point as does the wall\u2013fluid bridge function near coexistence on\nthe liquid side. Thus reference HNC omits effects of bulk criticality and of drying at the\nhard wall. In the present scheme, the fluid bridge function becomes long\u2013ranged through\nits functional dependence on the fluid correlation function g (which is long\u2013ranged near\nthe critical point) and so does the wall\u2013fluid bridge function near coexistence through\nits dependence on the wall\u2013particle correlation function g 12 . As will be seen, this does\nnot lead to the correct bulk critical behaviour for the fluid but drying at the hard wall\nis described very well.\nFor the determination of the unknown hard\u2013sphere diameter d1 we propose the\nfollowing criterion,\n\u0001 !\n\u2202\nF B,ref [\u03c10 g(r); d1] \u2212 F B,ref [\u03c10 g ref (r); d1 ] = 0 ,\n(36)\n\u2202d1\nwhich corresponds to extremizing the free energy difference between the fluid and the\nreference system with respect to d1 . The correlation function of the reference system\ng ref is taken to be the Percus\u2013Yevick correlation function consistent with the Rosenfeld\nfunctional. This criterion is local in the bulk state space (\u03c1, T ) and turns out to be\npracticable and reliable, furthermore it is seen in the numerical results that in the\n\n\f12\n\nIntegral equations for simple fluids in a general reference functional approach\n\nmoderate to high density region it is equivalent to the usual reference HNC criterion [8].\nHowever, a deeper understanding of equation (36) with regard to a unique specification\nof the reference system is absent at this point.\nFor the numerical calculations, we use the cut\u2013off rc = 4 \u03c3 for which an extensive\nbody of simulation data for the equation of state exists [41].\n3.1.

In Figure 1,\nwe present our results for p\u2217 (\u03c1\u22170 ) and \u03b2u(\u03c1\u22170 ) for temperatures T \u2217 = 0.8 . . . 1.4. We see\nthat for all temperatures and densities (both close to and away from the critical region)\nthe pressure and internal energy calculated from the reference functional match the\nsimulation data very well. This indicates that the pair correlation function g(r) is very\naccurate within the range of u11 (r) (see equations (37) and (38)). In Figure 2, we check\nthe consistency of the virial and the compressibility equation of state (upper panel) and\nthe Gibbs\u2013Duhem relation (lower panel) with the chemical potential calculated via the\ninsertion method, equation (42). Clearly, for the critical region, roughly delineated\nby T \u2217 = 1.2 . . . 1.3 and \u03c1\u22170 = 0.15 . . . 0.5, we observe inconsistencies between the\nvirial and compressibility equation of state, and, somewhat weaker, deviations from\n(\u2202p/\u2202\u03bc) / \u03c10 = 1. However, outside the critical region and for stable bulk densities \u03c10 ,\nthe ratio of \u2202p/\u2202\u03c10 calculated via equation (39) and via the derivative of equation (37)\nindicates violations of at most 20%, and the Gibbs-Duhem relation is satisfied rather\nwell. This will be important for the subsequent investigation of drying at the hard wall.\n\u00b6 Reduced units, denoted by an asterisk, are defined by setting \u01eb = \u03c3 = 1.\n\n\fIntegral equations for simple fluids in a general reference functional approach\n\n14\n\nFigure 2.

In both\npanels, the density coordinate of the filled circles for the three lowest temperatures\nT \u2217 indicates the corresponding coexistence density of the liquid phase obtained from\nsimulations [41].\n\n\fIntegral equations for simple fluids in a general reference functional approach\n\n15\n\n3.2. Two routes to liquid\u2013vapour coexistence and drying at the hard wall\nIntegral equations usually give results for pair correlation functions in the metastable\nas well as in the stable region, and therefore it is customary to obtain the coexistence\ncurve by requiring \u03bc(\u03c1l ) = \u03bc(\u03c1g ) and p(\u03c1l ) = p(\u03c1g ); this is equivalent to employing a\ncommon tangent or Maxwell construction. The density of the coexisting liquid is given\nby \u03c1l , while \u03c1g denotes the coexisting gas density. The pressure is given by equation\n(37) and the chemical potential may be calculated by either equation (41) or in our case\nequation (42).\nHowever, one may avoid the problem of dealing with correlation functions in the\nmetastable domain altogether if one defines \u03c1l as the bulk density for which complete\ndrying at a hard wall occurs at a given T < Tc . Correspondingly, \u03c1g is then the density\nin the bulk of the infinitely extended drying film.\nIn order to understand the physics of drying [42], let us consider a liquid of density\n\u03c10 near a hard wall at fixed temperature which is close to coexistence, expressed by\n\u03b4\u03bc = \u03bc(\u03c10 ) \u2212 \u03bc(\u03c1l ) > 0 and \u03b4\u03bc small. Since the wall exerts no attractive forces on the\nfluid molecules, we would expect the fluid density near the wall to be gaslike as this\nis energetically more favourable. Corroborating this argument, there exists a sum rule\nrelating the fluid density at the hard wall, \u03c1c , to the bulk pressure of the liquid,\n\u03c1c = \u03b2p(\u03bc(\u03c1))\n\u2248 \u03b2(p(\u03bc(\u03c1l )) + \u03c1l \u03b4\u03bc) ,\n\u2248 \u03c1g + \u03b2(\u03b21 \u03c12g /2 + \u03c1l \u03b4\u03bc) ,\n\n(45)\n\n(see also equation (63) below). Since the second virial coefficient of a simple liquid, \u03b21 ,\nis negative, this sum rule tells us that \u03c1c < \u03c1g for \u03b4\u03bc \u2192 0. Therefore the density profile\nmust pass from a value smaller than the coexisting gas density at the wall to the liquid\ndensity in the bulk. Since we can safely assume (for T < Tc ) that the transition from\n\u03c1g to \u03c1l happens within a few molecular diameters we are led to the hypothesis that\nupon \u03b4\u03bc \u2192 0 a gas layer forms between the hard wall and the bulk liquid whose width\nl goes to infinity as \u03b4\u03bc \u2192 0 for all T < Tc \u2013 complete drying occurs. More formally, the\nemergence of the gas film may be treated using a coarse\u2013grained interface Hamiltonian\nwhich in mean\u2013field approximation predicts a slow divergence of the gas film width\nupon approaching coexistence: l \u221d \u2212 ln \u03b4\u03bc. For a recent general analysis of liquids with\nshort\u2013ranged attractions near spherical hard walls, see reference [43].\nThe coexisting densities in the hard wall route are obtained by inspecting the grand\npotential\n\u03a9[\u03c1] = F id[\u03c1(r)] + F HNC [\u03c1(r)] + F B,ref [\u03c1(r)] \u2212\nZ\ndr(\u03bc(\u03c1l ) \u2212 u12 (r))\u03c1(r) ,\n\n(46)\n\nwith u12 (r) \u2192 u12 (z), the planar hard wall potential. The excess free energy functional\nF HNC + F B,ref is given by the Taylor expansion around the liquid bulk density \u03c10 = \u03c1l .\nWhen examining the stability conditions of an infinitely extended drying film between\n\n\fIntegral equations for simple fluids in a general reference functional approach\n\n16\n\nthe wall and the infinitely extended bulk liquid, we can neglect the hard wall potential\nu12 and the grand potential functional in equation (46) simply becomes the bulk grand\npotential in a Taylor expansion around \u03c1l . As a first condition, the grand potential of\nthe drying film with density \u03c1g must be stationary\n\u03b4\u03a9\n!\n=0.\n(47)\n\u03b4\u03c1(r) \u03c1(r)=\u03c1g\nLet V denote the system volume. We introduce the bulk densities of the grand potential,\n\u03c9(\u03c1) = \u03a9(\u03c1)/V and of the free energy, f (\u03c1) = F (\u03c1)/V . The second condition is that\nthe drying film can only coexist with the liquid if the grand potential densities for the\ntwo bulk densities \u03c1g and \u03c1l are equal:\n!\n\n\u03c9(\u03c1g ) \u2212 \u03c9(\u03c1l ) = 0 .\n\n(48)\n\nWe insert the grand potential of equation (46) into the above two conditions, evaluate\nthem at the required coexisting bulk densities and using the abbreviations \u2206\u03bc =\n\u03bc(\u03c1g ) \u2212 \u03bc(\u03c1l ), \u2206\u03c9 = \u03c9(\u03c1g ) \u2212 \u03c9(\u03c1l ) we obtain:\n!\n\n0 = \u03b2\u2206\u03bc = \u03b2\u03bcex,ref (\u03c1g ; d1,l ) \u2212 \u03b2\u03bcex,ref (\u03c1l ; d1,l ) +\n\u0002 (2)\n\u0003\n\u03c1l\n,\n(49)\nc\u0303 (0; \u03c1l ) \u2212 c\u0303(2),ref (0; d1,l) (\u03c1g \u2212 \u03c1l ) + log\n\u03c1g\n1\n!\n0 = \u2206\u03c9 = f ex,ref (\u03c1l ; d1,l ) \u2212 f ex,ref (\u03c1g ; d1,l ) + (\u03c1l \u2212 \u03c1g ) \u2212\n\u03b2\n\u0002\n\u0003\nex,ref\nex,ref\n\u03c1l \u03bc\n(\u03c1l ; d1,l ) \u2212 \u03c1g \u03bc\n(\u03c1g ; d1,l ) +\n\u0003\n1 \u0002 (2)\nc\u0303 (0; \u03c1l ) \u2212 c\u0303(2),ref (0; d1,l ) (\u03c12l \u2212 \u03c12g )\n(50)\n2\u03b2\nHere, d1,l = d1 (\u03c1l ) is the reference hard\u2013sphere diameter which is determined by\ncondition (36) and c\u0303(2) (k) is the Fourier transform of c(2) (r). The system of equations\n(49) and (50) can be solved for \u03c1l and \u03c1g along with the simultaneous solution to the\nintegral equations (31) and (32) for the liquid (which is needed to obtain c\u0303(2) (0; \u03c1l )).\nIn Figure 3 we compare the coexistence curve from the standard Maxwell\nconstruction (using equations (37) and (42)) and that from hard\u2013wall drying with a\ncurve fitted to simulation data from reference [41] which was obtained from an equation\nof state. In agreement with our findings concerning the accuracy of the Gibbs\u2013Duhem\nequation (cf. Figure (2)), the Maxwell construction gives an excellent description of\nthe coexistence curve away from the critical region. Closer to the critical point, we\nare not able to find a solution using the Maxwell construction. This can be traced\nback to the violation of the Gibbs\u2013Duhem equation. Hard\u2013wall drying yields coexisting\nliquid densities with similar accuracy but there are clear deviations from simulations\nfor the coexisting gas densities are clearly visible. The reason for this lies in the error\nin extrapolating the bulk grand potential density, equation (50), to low densities, using\nonly bulk properties of the reference system and the pair direct correlation function of\nthe coexisting liquid state point. Nevertheless, the fair agreement between the results\nfrom the Maxwell construction and from hard\u2013wall drying is most encouraging, and, to\nour knowledge, has not been achieved before within integral equation approaches.\n\n\fIntegral equations for simple fluids in a general reference functional approach\n\n17\n\nFigure 3.

Its explicit\nform is given in Appendix A. In Figure 4 we show the surface tension and the adsorption\ndensity obtained from the reference functional theory together with a fit to the mean\u2013\nfield prediction given by equations (51) and (52). We observe that the latter describes\nthe integral equation results not only close to the coexisting density \u03c1\u2217l \u2248 0.686 but also\nup to densities \u03c1\u22170 = 0.8 (\u03b4\u03bc\u2217 \u2248 1.5) where we can observe a crossover of the adsorption\ndensity from negative to positive values which is equivalent to a maximum in the surface\ntension. This result is consistent with the idea that the wall\u2013fluid correlations are derived\nfrom a generalized mean field functional; see equation (26) and the discussion thereafter.\nNote that results very similar to those in Figure 4 were obtained in one of the pioneering\nstudies of hard\u2013wall drying [42], in simulations for a square\u2013well fluid.\nNext, we compare the predictions for the wall\u2013fluid bridge function b12 (z) using\nthe reference functional with those of the reference HNC equations. This comparison is\nshown in Figure 5 for a state point very close to coexistence (\u03c1\u22170 = 0.6859) and a state\npoint deep in the stable liquid domain (\u03c1\u22170 = 0.9). In reference HNC, the bridge function\nis derived purely from the reference system (hard spheres with diameter d1 at the hard\nwall) and this bridge function is approximated very well by\nb12\nRHNC (z) = \u03b2\n\n\u03b4F B,ref\n\u03b4\u03c1(r)\n\n.\n\n(54)\n\n\u03c1(r)=\u03c10 g 12,ref (z)\n\nHere, g 12,ref is the wall\u2013fluid correlation function for hard spheres at the hard wall\nobtained by minimizing the Rosenfeld hard sphere functional in the presence of the hard\nwall potential. For the higher bulk density (lower panel in Figure 5) b12 and b12\nRHNC show\nvery similar, short\u2013ranged behaviour whereas for the density close to coexistence (upper\npanel in Figure 5) b12 acquires a long\u2013ranged component of approximately the same\nextent as the drying film (compare with the plot of g 12 in Figure 5). Such a long\u2013range\nbehaviour is completely absent in b12\nRHNC which stays short\u2013ranged and consequently the\ndrying film formation is not captured by the reference HNC equations.\n3.3. Comparison with the hydrostatic HNC approach\nAt this point it is worthwhile to compare the present approach with the hydrostatic HNC\n(HHNC) equations of references [11, 12] which is to the author's knowledge the only\nsystematic attempt to account for wetting (drying) phenomena within integral equation\ntheories. Following reference [11], we imagine that an atom of species 2 (originally our\nhard cavities) exerts a very weak and slowly varying potential on an atom of species 1.\nLet the slowly varying correlation functions between species 2 and species 1 be denoted\n\n\fIntegral equations for simple fluids in a general reference functional approach\n\n20\n\nFigure 5.

In order to apply this approximation for\nthe bridge function to potentials which vary sharply over molecular distances (i.e., the\nhard wall potential or the fluid potential u11 ) the authors of references [11, 12] introduce\na normalized weight function w(r) which smoothes the correlation functions:\nex\nex\nb12\nHHNC (r) = \u03b2\u03bc (\u03c10 gs (r)) \u2212 \u03b2\u03bc (\u03c10 ) \u2212 \u03c10 hs (r)\n\nhs (r) = w \u2217 h12 (r),\n\ngs (r) = w \u2217 g 12 (r) .\n\n(57)\n\nAs previously, the asterisk denotes a convolution. Thus the bridge function is\nex\nex\n(2)\n12\nb12\nHHNC (r) = \u03b2\u03bc (\u03c10 gs (r)) \u2212 \u03b2\u03bc (\u03c10 ) + \u03c10 c\u0303 (0) w \u2217 h (r) .\n\n(58)\n\nThe wall\u2013fluid integral equation based on this bridge function,\nlog g 12 + \u03b2u12 = \u03c10 h12 \u2217 c(2) \u2212 b12\nHHNC\n\n(59)\n\nsupports a drying solution at the \"true\" coexisting densities. To see this, let \u03c10 = \u03c1l ,\nthen within the thick drying film g 12 = \u03c1g /\u03c1l and \u03b2\u03bcex (\u03c10 gs (r)) \u2212 \u03b2\u03bcex (\u03c10 ) = log(\u03c1l /\u03c1g ),\nconsistent with equation (59). The drawback of this reasoning is that one needs explicitly\nthe function \u03bcex (\u03c1) (which one would like to actually obtain from the fluid integral\nequation) and the introduction of the weight function is purely phenomenological.\nFurthermore, if one applies this form of the bridge function to the integral equation of\nthe fluid itself, the results are clearly inferior to the present method or to reference HNC.\nThus there appears to be no route in HHNC to obtain the excess chemical potential\n\u03bcex (\u03c1) self\u2013consistently.\nOn the other hand, the formally exact bridge function is given by\nb12 = \u03b2\n\n\u03b4F B\n\u03b4\u03c1(r)\n\n\u03c1(r)=\u03c10 g 12 (z)\n\nex\n\n= \u03b2\u03bc [\u03c10 g 12 (z)] \u2212 \u03b2\u03bcex (\u03c10 ) + \u03c10 h12 \u2217 c(2) (z) ,\n\n(60)\n\nwhich follows from equations (7) and (8). Its approximation in the reference functional\nformalism is given by\nb12 \u2248 \u03b2\u03bcex,ref [\u03c10 g 12 (z); d1 ] \u2212 \u03b2\u03bcex,ref (\u03c10 ; d1 ) + \u03c10 h12 \u2217 c(2),ref (z; d1 )\n\n(61)\n\nHere the excess chemical potentials \u03bcex [*] and \u03bcex,ref [*] are given by\n\u03bcex[,ref] [\u03c1(r)] =\n\n\u03b4F ex[,ref]\n\u03b4\u03c1(r)\n\n(62)\n\nIn the case of the Rosenfeld functional, \u03bcex,ref [*] involves double convolutions with a\ncertain set of geometric weight functions [25]. Comparing equations (58) and (61)\n\n\fIntegral equations for simple fluids in a general reference functional approach\n\n22\n\nwe note that instead of employing the exact fluid chemical potential \u03bcex and direct\ncorrelation function c(2) , the respective reference system quantities appear and that the\nphenomenological weight function w is replaced by more complicated expressions related\nto the nature of the reference functional. The comparison illustrates that compared to\nHHNC, the bridge function within the reference functional method takes account of the\nshort\u2013range correlation much better because of the use of the very accurate Rosenfeld\nfunctional. On the other hand, through the introduction of the reference system, the\nhydrostatic limit is not fulfilled by the reference functional method; this is reflected by\nthe fact that the coexisting densities derived from hard\u2013wall drying (equations (49) and\n(50)) are nor perfectly consistent with those from the Maxwell construction.\n3.4. Sum rules and the relation to mean\u2013field DFT\nFor the planar hard wall problem, two important sum rules exist:\n\u03b2p\n= g 12 (0) ,\n\u03c10\n\u2202\u03b3wl\n\u2212\n= \u0393wl (\u03bc) .\n\u2202\u03bc\n\n(63)\n(64)\n\nThe first is the contact sum rule (see equation (45)) which links the pressure p in the\nbulk to the fluid density at contact with the wall. The second is the Gibbs adsorption\nequation and links the surface tension to the adsorption density. As usual, the derivative\nis performed on an isotherm.\nThe Gibbs adsorption rule remains valid for local density functionals and functionals\nwhich are constructed from weighted densities (WDA). The contact rule remains only\nvalid for free energy functionals of WDA type [27]. This has rendered such functionals\na popular tool for the investigation of inhomogeneous matter. However, one should add\nthe proviso that in equation (63), the pressure p is the one derived from the free energy\nfunctional for bulk densities, i.e. from the compressibility equation of state. Simple\nfluids are almost exclusively treated in density functional theory using a mean\u2013field\napproximation for the attractive tails (see below) for which the consistency between\nthe virial and compressibility equation of state is not very good. Moreover, one might\nobject that agreement with sum rule (64) does not guarantee the accuracy of \u03b3wl and\n\u0393wl themselves, as these quantities depend strongly on the quality of the free energy\nfunctional.\nFor hard spheres, these problems are solved to a high degree of accuracy by presently\navailable functionals [26, 45]. The simplest mean\u2013field treatment of fluids in which the\npair potential u11 (r) has an attractive tail is given by\nZ\n1\nex\nex,ref\ndr \u03c1(r) watt \u2217 \u03c1(r) ,\n(65)\nF [\u03c1(r)] = F\n[\u03c1(r); d1 = const.] +\n2\nwhere we consider a one\u2013component system. Here, the weight function watt is given\nby the attractive tail of the interparticle potential (for which various recipes exist in\nthe literature). If we compare the second term in equation (65) with the excess free\n\n\fIntegral equations for simple fluids in a general reference functional approach\n\n23\n\nFigure 6.

Thus we may conclude, if the prefactor of the quadratic term\nin equation (26), (c(2) \u2212 c(2),ref )/\u03b2, does not vary appreciably with the bulk density \u03c10\nthen a description in terms of the functional given in equation (65) will capture the\nessential physics. Checking the numerical results (see Figure 6), we find that for r > \u03c3\nindeed a single function describes this prefactor for all stable liquid state points except\nfor the ones in the critical region. Inside the harshly repulsive core (r < \u03c3) we notice\nsome variation which is, however, small when compared to the magnitude of the direct\npair correlation function of the reference system. Thus the \"mean\u2013field\" expansion\naround the bulk density as given in equation (26) is expected to entail similar physics\nas that in the mean\u2013field functional (65) but the former has the effect of giving a more\naccurate equation of state and very reliable fluid correlation functions. The mean field\napproach (26) is, in turn, computationally less demanding and has the advantage that\nthe sum rules hold analytically (with respect to the compressibility equation of state).\nIt is important to note that the very concept of expanding around a fixed bulk\n\n\fIntegral equations for simple fluids in a general reference functional approach\n\n24\n\nFigure 7.

The deviations are up to 20%. However,\ndespite these deviations these results are encouraging since here the virial (= quasi\u2013\nexact) pressure is used. In Figure 8 we compare the adsorption densities calculated by\nequation (53) with the adsorption density obtained from the surface tension via the sum\nrule (64). Again we find very reasonable agreement.\n4. Summary and conclusions\nIn this article, we have analyzed the pair correlation functions of an inhomogeneous\nfluid mixture by means of a functional Taylor expansion of the free energy around an\ninhomogeneous density profile. We have derived a general integral equation closure for\ninhomogeneous systems which is based on the introduction of a reference functional for\nthe excess free energy beyond second order in the Taylor expansion.

Treating this problem within the mixture theory and expanding around the bulk\nstate, we find excellent agreement between the virial and internal energy routes to the\nequation of state for the fluid and with simulations. Thermodynamic consistency is\n\n\fIntegral equations for simple fluids in a general reference functional approach\n\n26\n\ngood for stable state points outside the critical region. By virtue of the underlying\nhard sphere reference functional, complete drying is predicted for the hard wall\u2013liquid\ninterface and the corresponding coexisting densities for the liquid branch are in excellent\nagreement with those from the Maxwell construction. However, there are deviations for\nthe coexisting densities on the gas branch. Nevertheless, this reasonable consistency\nbetween the Maxwell construction and hard wall drying is a novel result within integral\nequation approaches.\nTwo sum rules related to the hard wall problem, the contact density rule, equation\n(63), and the Gibbs adsorption equation (64), have been investigated over a wide range\nof densities and temperatures. Although these sum rules are not satisfied exactly, the\ndeviations are reasonably small, especially near coexistence.\nThe numerical results for both the fluid\u2013fluid and the wall-fluid correlations suggest\na generalized mean field behavior outside the critical region. In the reference functional\napproach, the difference between the fluid free energy and the free energy of the reference\nsystem is expanded up to second order in the density difference (from the bulk density),\nsee equation (26). The coefficient of the second\u2013order term, the difference between the\npair direct correlation functions of the fluid and the reference system, is determined self\u2013\nconsistently and turns out to be quite insensitive to variations in temperature and bulk\ndensity for liquid states, see Figure 6. Therefore we argue that for physical problems\nrelated to wetting and drying a description with density functionals composed of an\naccurate reference part and a mean field attractive term should be sufficient to capture\nall the essential features and will be much less demanding in computational effort.\nRelated to the efficacy of generalized mean\u2013field treatments of simple fluids, we\nnote that a quite different mean\u2013field treatment of the density deviations from the bulk\nwas already developed in reference [47] in which the behaviour of a LJ fluid at a hard\nwall was studied as well. In contrast to the present study, the properties of the hard\nsphere reference system were fixed by considering the first YBG equation, for details see\nreference [47]. Good agreement between simulated and calculated density profiles was\nobtained for selected supercritical state points.\nWe anticipate interesting perspectives for further computations in the problem of\nsmall colloidal particles at interfaces. The free energy profile for particles dragged\nthrough the interface or their mutual interactions at the interface are only beginning\nto be understood. These observables can be analyzed within the reference functional\napproach for inhomogeneous distributions; the challenging numerical implementation\nremains a task for future work.\nAcknowledgments\nThe author is grateful to the Alexander von Humboldt\u2013Foundation for a research grant\nsupporting a stay in Bristol during which a good part of this work was completed.

Surface tension at the hard wall\nThe hard wall\u2013liquid surface tension is defined by the expression\nZ \u221e\n\u03b3wl =\ndz(\u03c9(z) + p) ,\n\n(A.1)\n\nwhere A denotes the area of the wall.\nZ We use the definition\n\u03a9[\u03c1(r)] = F [\u03c1(r)] \u2212 dr(\u03bc(\u03c10 ) \u2212 \u03be u12 (r)) \u03c1(r) .\n\n(A.3)\n\n0\n\nwhere \u03c9(z) is the grand potential volume density and p = p(\u03c10 ) is the bulk pressure\nof the liquid with density \u03c10 .

According\nto the discussion below equation (35) concerning the hard wall limit, the functional of\nthe free energy is the functional for the one\u2013component LJ fluid,\nF [\u03c1(r] = F id[\u03c1(r)] + F HNC [\u03c1(r)] + F B,ref [\u03c1(r); d1 ] ,\n\n(A.4)\n\nwith d1 = d1 (\u03c10 ) denoting the reference system hard sphere diameter.
