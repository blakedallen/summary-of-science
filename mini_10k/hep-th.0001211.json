The RS black\nhole can be considered as a stable remnant at z = 0 of the black cigar.\n\n1\n\n\fI. INTRODUCTION\n\nRecently there has been much interest in the Randall-Sundrum brane world [1\u20133]. A key\nidea of this model is that our universe may be a brane embedded in the higher dimensional\nspace. A concrete model is a single 3-brane embedded in the five-dimensional anti-de Sitter\nspace (AdS5 ), which acts like a box of the size \u223c 1/k. Randall and Sundrum have shown that\na longitudinal part (h\u03bc\u03bd ) of the metric fluctuations satisfies the Schr\u00f6dinger-like equation\nwith an attractive delta-function. As a result, the massless KK modes which describe the\nlocalized gravity on the brane were found. Furthermore, the massive KK modes lead to\ncorrections to the Newtonian potential like as V (r) = GN m1rm2 (1 + k21r2 ).\nHowever, we would like to point out that this has been done in the 4D Minkowski space\nwith the RS gauge1 . It seems that this gauge is so restrictive. In order to have welldefined theory on the brane, one has to include non-zero transverse parts of h4\u03bc and h44 at\nthe beginning. Ivanov and Volovich discussed along this direction by choosing the 5D de\nDonder gauge2 [4,5]. Also authors in Ref. [6] studied the propagation of the metric including\nwith non-zero transverse parts. It turned out that there are no massless scalar and vector\npropagations on the RS background. This implies that the RS gauge is a good choice for\ndescribing the brane world. Furthermore, it is shown that the RS Minkowski spacetime is\nstable only under the RS gauge.\nIf the Minkowski metric on the brane is replaced by any 4D Ricci-flat one, for example\nthe Schwarzschild metric, the 5D metric still satisfies the Einstein equation with a negative\ncosmological constant. In this process we obtain a black string solution in an AdS5 3 [7].\n\u22122\nS\nS\nThis is given by \u1e20BS\n(z)[\u1e21\u03bc\u03bd\n, 1] with the Schwarzschild metric \u1e21\u03bc\u03bd\n= diag[\u2212(1 \u2212\nMN = H\n2\n\u22121 2 2\n2M/r), (1 \u2212 2M/r) , r , r sin \u03b8]. It is shown that this black string is unstable near the\nAdS5 horizon of z = \u221e but it is stable far from the horizon. This is a result of the GregoryLaflamme instability [8], which states that the black string has a tendency to fragment near\nthe AdS5 -horizon [9]. A stable object left behind would resemble a black cigar, although\nwe do not know its explicit metric. Hence we have the RS black hole-picture on the brane\nlocated at z = 0. The horizon of black hole on the brane will be determined from the\nintersection of the black cigar with the brane. Here we assume that this is large such as\nrEH = 2M > 1/k. In this case an observer on the brane perceives exactly the Schwarzschild\nsolution, without any correction arising from the extra dimension [10]. In other words, any\nmassive KK mode are not excited in this circumstances . Then the zero modes of the bulk\ngraviton can describe this situation very well. Hence the zero mode approach becomes a\npowerful technique in the study of black holes on the brane.\nOn the other hand, Youm showed that the RS solution can be found in the dilatonic\ndomain wall [11,12]. In order to study physics on the brane, we need its effective action.\n\n1 In\n\nfact, this gauge for hM N is composed of Gaussian-Normal (GN) gauge (h44 = h4\u03bc = 0) and\n4D transverse, tracefree (TTF) gauge(\u2202 \u03bc h\u03bc\u03bd = 0, h\u03bc\u03bc = 0).\n2 This\n\ncorresponds to the 5D TTF gauge (\u2202M hM N = 0, hMM = 0).\n\n3 Precisely,\n\nthis is not a 5D black hole solution to the RS model. At present, nobody knows that.\n\n2\n\n\fIt is known that zero mode effective action takes a form of the Brans-Dicke model with a\npotential.\nIn this paper, we study stability of the large RS black hole with the z-independent\nperturbations such as h\u03bc\u03bd (x), h44 (x). We find that these are massless graviton and scalar\nmodes propagating in the RS black hole background. Here we do not require the 4D TTF\ngauge which is useful for the RS Minkowski space. Instead we choose the Regge-Wheeler\n(RW) gauge for our study of spherically symmetric background.\nII. RANDALL-SUNDRUM SOLUTION AND BRANS-DICKE TYPE MODEL\n\nWe start with the 5D bulk action and the 4D domain wall action as [12]\nS = Sbulk + SDW\n\n(1)\n\nwith\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1 Z 5 \u221a\n4\nM\n\u22122aD\nd\nx\n\u2202\nD\u2202\nD\n\u2212\ne\n\u039b\n,\n\u2212G\nR\n\u2212\nM\n5\n2\u03ba25\n3\nZ\n\u221a\n= \u2212\u03c3DW d4 x \u2212\u03b3e\u2212aD ,\n\nSbulk =\n\n(2)\n\nSDW\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03c3DW is the tension of the domain wall and \u03b3 is the determinant of the induced\nmetric \u03b3\u03bc\u03bd = \u2202\u03bc X M \u2202\u03bd X N GM N for the domain wall. Here M, N = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4(x4 = z) and\n\u03bc, \u03bd = 0, 1, 2, 3(x\u03bc = x). \"D\" denotes the dilaton. We are interested in the second RS\nsolution with4\n\u1e20M N = H \u22122 (z)\u03b7M N , D\u0304 = 0, \u039b = \u221212k 2 , \u03c3DW = 6k/\u03ba25 , a = 0\n\n(4)\n\nwith H = k|z| + 1 and \u03b7M N = diag[\u2212 + + + +]. Here overbar(\u2212 ) means the background\nvalue. In this paper we follow the MTW conventions [13].\nIn order to obtain a 4D effective action, we introduce the metric \u011cM N in GM N =\n\u22122\nH (z)\u011cM N which satisfies \u2202z \u011cM N = 0. Explicitly, the line element is given by\ndS52 = GM N dxM dxN = H \u22122\u011cM N dxM dxN\ni\n\nh\n\n= H \u22122 g\u03bc\u03bd (x)dx\u03bc dx\u03bd + \u03a62 (x)dz 2 .\n\n(5)\n\nOff-diagonal elements are not allowed because if they exist, these violate the Z2 -symmetry\nargument5 . At this stage we wish to remind the reader that \u03a6(x) has nothing to do with\nthe radion which is necessary for stabilizing the distance between two branes in the first RS\nmodel [1]. This is because here we consider the second RS model [2]. Substituting (5) with\n\n4 With\n\nthis ansatz, the dilatonic action Eq.(1) reduces to the second RS model exactly [2]\n\n5 One\n\nmay introduce off-diagonal term of 2A\u03bc (x)dx\u03bc dz. But this is not invariant under the reflection of z \u2192 \u2212z [1]. Thus we must have A\u03bc (x) = 0.\n\n3\n\n\fD = 0 into (1) and integrating it over z lead to the Brans-Dicke type model with a potential\n[12]\nSRS =\n\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0012\n\u0014\n1 Z 4 \u221a\n1\n2\nd\nx\n\u2212\n2\n\u03a6\n+\n\u2212g\n\u03a6R\n+\n6k\n2\u03ba24\n\u03a6\n\n(6)\n\nwith \u03ba24 = k\u03ba25 . This is our key action which is suitable for the study of physics defined on\nthe brane. Also it can be derived from the RS model directly. It is emphasized that the\nfirst term(\u03a6R) is the BD term with \u03c9 = 0 [14]. The BD model with \u03c9 = 0 corresponds\nto the massless Kaluza-Klein model with g\u03bc\u03bd , g44 (\u223c \u03a62 ), and g\u03bc4 (\u223c A\u03bc ) = 0 6 . In this\nsense, we wish to call \u03a6 as the BD scalar. The second term arises from the fact that the 5D\nspacetime is an AdS5 with a negative cosmological constant \u039b and a domain wall located at\nz = 0. Equivalently, this means that the RS solution gives us a non-factorizable geometry\nwith H = k|z| + 1. Hence this term accounts for the feature of the RS type solution and\nit plays the role of an effective potential. \u00bfFrom now on we wish to separate the pure BD\nmodel (LBD = \u03a6R) from the RS model (LRS = \u03a6R + 6k 2 (\u03a6 + 1/\u03a6 \u2212 2)) for comparison.\n\u00bfFrom (6) we derive the equations of motion (\u03b4\u03a6 SRS = 0, \u03b4g\u03bc\u03bd SRS = 0)\nR + 6k\n\n2\n\n1\n1\u2212 2\n\u03a6\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n= 0,\n\n(7)\n\n1\n1\n1\n\u2207\u03bc \u2207\u03bd \u03a6 \u2212 g\u03bc\u03bd \u2737\u03a6 + 3k 2 \u03a6 + \u2212 2 g\u03bc\u03bd .\nR\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 g\u03bc\u03bd R =\n2\n\u03a6\n\u03a6\n\u0012\n\n\u001a\n\n\u0013\n\n\u001b\n\n(8)\n\nContracting Eq.(8) with g \u03bc\u03bd and using Eq.(7) leads to the RS scalar equation\n\u2737\u03a6 + 2k\n\n2\n\n3\n\u2212\u03a6 \u2212 + 4 = 0.\n\u03a6\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(9)\n\nAlso from Eq.(8), its contraction form, and (9) one finds the other Einstein equation\nR\u03bc\u03bd =\n\no\n1n\n\u2207\u03bc \u2207\u03bd \u03a6 + 2k 2 (\u2212\u03a6 + 1) g\u03bc\u03bd .\n\u03a6\n\n(10)\n\nHere one finds a solution which satisfies all of equations (7)-(10) simultaneously as\n\u03a6\u0304 = 1, R\u0304 = 0, R\u0304\u03bc\u03bd = 0.\n\n(11)\n\nThis means that the Ricci-flat condition of R\u0304\u03bc\u03bd = 0 with \u03a6\u0304 = 1 describes the 4D vacuum\nconfiguration correctly.\nAs an example, we choose the Minkowski spacetime\n\u1e21\u03bc\u03bd = \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd , \u03a6\u0304 = 1.\n\n(12)\n\nTo study the propagations on this background, we introduce the perturbation around the\nbackground (12) as\n\n6\n\nThis model is based on the action of SKK =\nH = 1.\n\n1\n\u03ba25\n\n4\n\nR\n\n\u221a\nd5 x \u2212GR5 with a factorizable geometry of\n\n\fg\u03bc\u03bd = \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd + h\u03bc\u03bd , \u03a6 = \u03a6\u0304 + \u03c6 (g44 = \u1e2144 + h44 ).\n\n(13)\n\nThen the linearized equations to (9) and (10) are found to be\n\u2202 2 \u03c6 + 4k 2 \u03c6 = 0,\n\u03b4R\u03bc\u03bd (h) \u2212 \u2202\u03bc \u2202\u03bd \u03c6 + 2k 2 \u03c6\u03b7\u03bc\u03bd = 0\n\n(14)\n(15)\n\nwith\n\u03b4R\u03bc\u03bd = \u2212\n\ni\n1h 2\n\u2202 h\u03bc\u03bd + \u2202\u03bd \u2202\u03bc h\u03c1\u03c1 \u2212 \u2202 \u03c1 \u2202\u03bc h\u03bd\u03c1 \u2212 \u2202 \u03c1 \u2202\u03bd h\u03bc\u03c1 .\n2\n\n(16)\n\nUnder the 4D TTF gauge, one finds that \u03b4R\u03bc\u03bd = \u2212 21 \u2202 2 h\u03bc\u03bd and \u03b7 \u03bc\u03bd \u03b4R\u03bc\u03bd = \u2212 12 \u2202 2 h\u03bc\u03bc = 0.\nContracting Eq.(15) with \u03b7 \u03bc\u03bd leads to the other equation for \u03c6\n\u2202 2 \u03c6 \u2212 8k 2 \u03c6 = 0.\n\n(17)\n\nEq.(14) allows a tachyonic solution because it has a negative potential term of \u22124k 2 .

SCHWARZSCHILD BLACK HOLE SOLUTIONS\n\nIntroducing a spherically symmetric spacetime, one obtains the Schwarzschild black hole\nwith \u03a6\u0304 = 1 in the domain wall approach [7] as\nh\n\ni\n\n\u1e21\u03bc\u03bd = diag \u2212e\u03bd , e\u2212\u03bd , r 2 , r 2 sin2 \u03b8 ,\n\n(19)\n\nM\n(r \u2212 2M)M\n, R\u0304t\u03b8t\u03b8 = \u2212\n, R\u0304t\u03c6t\u03c6 = sin2 \u03b8R\u0304t\u03b8t\u03b8 ,\n3\n2\nr\nr\nM\n, R\u0304r\u03c6r\u03c6 = sin2 \u03b8R\u0304r\u03b8r\u03b8 , R\u0304\u03b8\u03c6\u03b8\u03c6 = \u22122Mr sin2 \u03b8,\nR\u0304r\u03b8r\u03b8 =\nr \u2212 2M\nR\u0304\u03bc\u03bd = 0, R\u0304 = 0\nR\u0304trtr = 2\n\nwith\ne\u03bd = 1 \u2212\n\n2M\n.\nr\n\n(20)\n\nHere M = GN M4 = \u03ba24 M4 /8\u03c0 = G5 kM4 with GN (4D Newtonian constant) and G5 (5D\nNewtonian constant). M4 is the mass of a large black hole with M4 > 1/(2k 2 G5 ). The BD\nand RS black hole solutions are permitted because the Schwarzschild solution comes from\nthe Ricci-flat condition. The BD (RS) black holes denote the Schwarzschild black hole with\n5\n\n\fLBD (LRS ), respectively. The BD black is introduced for reference. To study these black\nholes specifically, we introduce the perturbation\ng\u03bc\u03bd = \u1e21\u03bc\u03bd + h\u03bc\u03bd , \u03a6 = \u03a6\u0304 + \u03c6.\n\n(21)\n\nThen the linearized equations to Eqs. (9) and (10) are found as\n \u0304 \u03c6 + 4k 2 \u03c6 = 0,\n\u2737\n \u0304 \u03bd\u2207\n \u0304 \u03bc \u03c6 + 2k 2 \u03c6\u1e21\u03bc\u03bd = 0\n\u03b4R\u03bc\u03bd (h) \u2212 \u2207\n\n(22)\n(23)\n\nwith the Lichnerowicz operator \u03b4R\u03bc\u03bd (h) [15,16]\n\u03b4R\u03bc\u03bd (h) = \u2212\n\ni\n1h\n\u03c1\n\u03c1 \u0304\n\u03c1 \u0304\n \u0304\n \u0304\n \u0304\n \u0304\n \u0304\nh\n+\n\u2207\n\u2207\nh\n\u2212\n\u2207\n\u2207\nh\n\u2212\n\u2207\n\u2207\nh\n\u03bd \u03bc \u03c1\n\u03bc \u03bd\u03c1\n\u03bd \u03bc\u03c1 .\n\u2737 \u03bc\u03bd\n2\n\n(24)\n\nWe note that Eq. (23) is not a diagonalized form to obtain eigenmodes. If one introduces\n\u0125\u03c1\u03bd = h\u03c1\u03bd + \u03c6\u1e21\u03c1\u03bd , then this leads to\n\u03b4R\u03bc\u03bd (\u0125) = 0.\n\n(25)\n\nThis is the perturbed equation of pure 4D gravity for \u0125\u03bc\u03bd 7 . A way to analyze Eqs.(22) and\n(23) is known [19,20]. For instance, it is possible if one uses the RW gauge instead of the 4D\nTTF gauge. The perturbation \u0125\u03bc\u03bd falls into two distinct classes - odd and even parities with\n(\u22121)l+1 and (\u22121)l , respectively. l denotes an angular quantum number on S 2 : L\u03042 Ylm (\u03b8, \u03c6) =\n\u2212l(l+1)Ylm (\u03b8, \u03c6). Among ten components in the axisymmetric perturbation, one can always\nchoose six components by taking into account the general coordinate transformations : x\u03bc\u2032 =\nx\u03bc + \u01eb\u03be \u03bc [21,22]. This is a choice of the RW gauge. And this is obvious here because\nwe consider the propagation of gravitons on the brane. In the RW gauge we assign two\ncomponents (h0 , h1 ) for odd parity\n\n\u0125odd\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\n0\n0\n\uf8ec 0\n0\n\uf8ec\n=\uf8ec\n\uf8ed 0\n0\nh0 (r) h1 (r)\n\uf8eb\n\n0 h0 (r)\ndPl (\u03b8)\n0 h1 (r) \uf8f7\n\uf8f7 \u2212i\u03c9t\n\uf8f7e\nsin \u03b8\n0 0 \uf8f8\nd\u03b8\n0 0\n\uf8f6\n\n(26)\n\neven\nwith Legendre polynomial Pl (\u03b8). For even parity, we have \u0125even\n= heven\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03bc\u03bd + \u03c6\u1e21\u03bc\u03bd , where h\u03bc\u03bd\nis composed of four components (H0 , H1 , H2 , K) as\n\nheven\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\n=\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n\u0010\n\nH0 1 \u2212\nH1\n0\n0\n\n2M\nr\n\n\u0011\n\nH1\n\u0010\n\nH2 1 \u2212 2M\nr\n0\n0\n\n0\n\u0011\u22121\n\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\n\uf8f7 \u2212i\u03c9t\n0\n0\nPl (\u03b8).\n\uf8f7e\n\uf8f7\n2\nr K(r)\n0\n\uf8f8\n0\nr 2 sin2 \u03b8K(r)\n\n(27)\n\nThese two cases are never mixed and thus they provide two degrees of freedom which is\nnecessary for describing a massless spin-2 particle.\n\n7 Its\n\nstability analysis was performed 30 years ago [17,18] .\n\n6\n\n\fA. RS scalar perturbation\n\nLet us first analyze the RS scalar perturbation using Eq.(22). Considering \u03c6 \u221d\nand the background (19), one finds the Schr\u00f6dinger-type equation\n\n\u03c8(r)\nYlm (\u03b8, \u03c6)e\u2212i\u03c9t\nr\n\n\u0011\nd2 \u03c8 \u0010 2\nRS\n\u03c8 = 0,\n+\n\u03c9\n\u2212\nV\n\u03c8\ndr \u22172\n\n(28)\n\nwhere the RS scalar potential is given by\nV\u03c8RS (r)\n\n2M\n= 1\u2212\nr\n\u0012\n\n\u0013(\n\nl(l + 1) 2M\n+ 3 \u2212 4k 2\nr2\nr\n\u0010\n\n)\n\n(29)\n\n\u0011\n\nr\nwith the tortoise coordinate r \u2217 = r + 2M ln 2M\n\u2212 1 . \u00bfFrom the analysis in ref. [20], we\nfind that for \u03c9 = i\u03b1, 0 < \u03b1 < 2k, the scalar perturbation has an exponentially growing\nmode of e\u03b1t . Therefore this system may be classically unstable. In other words, \"\u22124k 2 \" in\nthe potential induces an instability of the asymptotically flat space of r \u2192 \u221e. Thus we call\nit as a potential instability. This may imply that the RS black hole solution is classically\nunstable. However, it is not true. Any exponentially growing mode is not allowed for the\nRS spherically symmetric background. An important point what we remind is that an AdS5\nacts like a box of size8 \u223c (2k)\u22121 [7]. So it may allow an unstable perturbation of wavelength\nwith \u03bb \u2264 (2k)\u22121 only [23]. However, for this case, we cannot find any consistent (unstable)\nsolution [20]. In the unstable case of 0 < \u03b1 = \u03bb\u22121 < 2k, one finds a condition of \u03bb > (2k)\u22121\nwhich is forbidden inside an AdS5 . The instability problem can be cured by considering\nthe bulk spacetime. Hence we can include the RS scalar mode, as a physical field, which\npropagates in the RS black hole background.\n\nB. Odd parity perturbation for \u0125\u03bc\u03bd\n\nNow we discuss the odd parity perturbation for \u0125\u03bc\u03bd . \u00bfFrom Eq.(23), we have three\nequations :\n\u03b4R03 = \u03b4R13 = \u03b4R23 = 0.\nHere we obtain the Regge-Wheeler equation using Q \u2261\n\n(30)\nh1\nr\n\n\u0011\nd2 Q \u0010 2\n+\n\u03c9\n\u2212\nV\n(r)\nQ = 0,\nRW\ndr \u2217 2\n\n\u0010\n\n1\u2212\n\n2M\nr\n\n\u0011\n\n(31)\n\nwhere the Regge-Wheeler potential is given by\n\u221a\nR\na conventional length scale of an AdS5 is determined by d5 x \u2212GR5 in Eq.(2) as\nR\ndzH \u22123 = 1/k, we here choose a size of the AdS5 -box as 1/(2k) for a definite calculation. This\n\u221a\nR\nR\ncomes from :\u2212\u039b d5 x \u2212G \u2192 dzH \u22125 = 1/(2k).\n8 Although\n\n7\n\n\f2M\nVRW (r) = 1 \u2212\nr\n\u0012\n\nl(l + 1) 6M\n\u2212 3\nr2\nr\n\n\u0013\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(32)\n\nFurther h0 is not an independent mode, it can be expressed in terms of Q as h0 = \u03c9i drd\u2217 (rQ).\nWe note that the BD black hole [19] takes the same potential as in Eq.(32) for the odd\nparity perturbation. This case has already been analyzed by Vishveshwara in ref. [17] and\nan allowed solution is a scattering state\nQ\u221e = e\u2212i\u03c9r + A\u2212 ei\u03c9r (r \u2217 \u2192 \u221e),\n\u2217\nQ2M = B \u2212 e\u2212i\u03c9r (r \u2217 \u2192 \u2212\u221e).\n\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\n(33)\n\nC. Even parity perturbation for \u0125\u03bc\u03bd\n\nIn this case, from the remaining seven equations, we have the Zerilli equation in ref. [17]\n\u0011\nd2 \u03c8Z \u0010 2\n+\n\u03c9\n\u2212\nV\n(r)\n\u03c8Z = 0,\nZ\ndr \u22172\n\n(34)\n\nwhere the Zerilli potential is given by\n2M\nVZ (r) = 1 \u2212\nr\n\u0012\n\n\u0013(\n\n2\u03bb2 (\u03bb + 1)r 3 + 6\u03bb2 Mr 2 + 18\u03bbM 2 r + 18M 3\nr 3 (\u03bbr + 3M)2\n\n)\n\n(35)\n\nwith \u03bb = (l \u2212 1)(l + 2)/2. Here \u03c8Z (r) is a gauge invariant combination of H0 , H1 , H2 , K, \u03c8/r\n[19,21,22]. At this stage we would like to comment that the BD equation (\u03b4R\u03bc\u03bd (h) \u2212\n\u2207\u03bd \u2207\u03bc \u03c6 = 0) in ref. [19] takes the same equation as in Eq.(34). Also it is easily shown\nthat an allowed solution is a plane wave like Eq.(33). This fact can be easily read off from\nthe shape of potentials VRW and VZ . Because these all belong to positive potential barrier for\nl \u2265 2, there exist scattering states only. In other words, there are no bound state solutions.\nThis means that one cannot find any exponentially growing mode in the graviton sector,\neven if k 2 -term is involved in the RS equation (23).\nIV. DISCUSSIONS\n\nWe investigate the zero mode sector of the 5D dilatonic domain wall solution. This\nsector is very useful for describing the RS black hole on the brane. Assuming a spherically\nsymmetric spacetime, one has a large black hole on the brane. We perform the analysis of\nstability to see whether or not the RS black hole truly exists. It is well-known that the BD\nblack hole is stable. Here one finds an exponentially growing mode for the RS black hole\nbecause of a negative nature of its potential. If there is an exponentially growing mode, its\nblack hole is classically unstable. \u00bfFrom the analysis of \u03c6 in the RS Minkowski spacetime,\nwe have \u03c6 = 0 under the 4D TTF gauge. On the other hand, we cannot have \u03c6 = 0 in\nthe spherically symmetric black hole spacetime with the RW gauge. Fortunately, we find\nthat this instability is not allowed inside an AdS5 whose size is (2k)\u22121 . Hence the instability\n8\n\n\fproblem is cured. Actually BD scalar as well as gravitons can propagate in the black hole\nspacetime. Also this implies that the large RS black hole is stable.\nFor the metric perturbations, we don't worry about their stability even for considering\n\u03c6 6= 0. Choosing the RW gauge, the graviton sector including \u03c6 leads to the well-known two\nclasses of odd and even-parities. Since this sector has always positive potential barriers for\nany l with l \u2265 2 [18], there are no exponentially growing modes. Also this can be confirmed\nfrom the other side. If we introduce a new tensor \u0125\u03bc\u03bd , Eq. (23) reduces to Eq. (25). This\nis nothing but the perturbed equation for pure 4D gravity, which was proved to be stable\nthirty years ago.\nIn conclusion, the large black hole in the dilaton domain wall is stable. This can represent\na stable form on the brane for the RS black cigar whose metric is not known up to now.\nFinally we comment that the RS black hole can be described by massless gravitons and a\nscalar mode with smaller wavelength than the size of an AdS5 -box.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\n\nWe thank to J.Y.
