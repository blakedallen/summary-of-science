Introduction\nWitten's action of cubic bosonic string field theory [1],\nS=\n\n1\n1\nh\u03a8| QB \u03a8i + h\u03a8| \u03a8 \u22c6 \u03a8i ,\n2\n3\n\n(1.1)\n\nleads to an innocent looking equation of motion,\nQB \u03a8 + \u03a8 \u22c6 \u03a8 = 0 .\n\n(1.2)\n\nYet, this equation remained unsolved for twenty years, until recently Schnabl finally found\na non trivial analytic solution [2]. The complexity of this equation stems from the infinite\nnumber of string fields, its non-linearity and the difference in forms of the linear and nonlinear terms. Many attempts have been made in order to simplify the structure of this\nequation [3\u201314].\nApproximate numerical solutions were found earlier using level truncation regularization [15]. Level truncation solves two issues. First, it gives a brute force tool for handling\nthe complexity of the star product. Second, it offers an elegant solution to the singularities that arise in string field theory due to the existence of an infinite tower of degrees of\nfreedom.\nSchnabl overcame the complexity of the equation of motion using an intelligent choice of\ncoordinates that simplifies the star product and a novel gauge choice, which simultaneously\nsimplifies the kinetic term. The regularization of his solution came out naturally from the\nderivation, and it can be written as\n\u03a8\u03bb = lim \u03bbN \u03c8N \u2212\nN \u2192\u221e\n\nN\nX\n\nn=0\n\n\u0001\n\u03bbn \u2202n \u03c8n .\n\n(1.3)\n\nThe tachyon solution is \u03a8 \u2261 \u03a81 , where it should be understood that we first set \u03bb = 1 and\nonly then take the limit N \u2192 \u221e. The \u03a8\u03bb with \u03bb < 1 form a one parameter family of pure\ngauge solutions.\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n\fIn order to prove that \u03a8\u03bb are indeed solutions, Schnabl showed that they satisfy the\nequation of motion when contracted with a Fock space state h\u03c6|, that is,\nh\u03c6| QB \u03a8\u03bb + \u03a8\u03bb \u22c6 \u03a8\u03bb i = 0 .\n\n(1.4)\n\nHere, we follow the standard abuse of terminology, defining a \"Fock space\" state as a state\nwith a finite number of excitations. This \"Fock space\" fails to satisfy the completness\nrequirement of a Hilbert space. Moreover, it is not closed under the star product. Even\nthe state |3i \u2261 |0i \u22c6 |0i is not part of this space. Needless to say that neither the tachyon\nnor the gauge solutions are in this space.\nThis raises the notorious problem of defining \"the correct space of string fields\". This\nentity is not easily defined due to the absence of a positive definite norm in this space.\nNevertheless, it is clear that such a definition is crucial. Without a proper definition of\nthis space even the most fundamental questions, such as the triviality (of the cohomology)\nof the kinetic operator around the new vacuum Q, are not well posed. Moreover, even the\nderivation of (1.2) from (1.1) requires the definition of a space, for which a generalization\nof the fundamental lemma of the calculus of variations holds. Lacking a definition of such a\nspace we are led to guesswork. Due to the existence of the second term in the action (1.1),\nit is natural to expect that this space forms a star-algebra1 . Thus, it is reasonable to\nrequire that the (integer) wedge states lie in this space [17, 18]. Other clues for the form\nof this space can come from various anomalies. For example, it was shown by Schnabl\nthat the inclusion of the so called \"unbalanced wedge states\" into the space of string\nfields results in inconsistencies [18]. Other examples of potentially problematic anomalies\ninclude twist, midpoint and associativity anomalies [19\u201322]. Some other thumb rules that\nwere considered for deciding whether a state is legitimate or not include a well defined local\ncoordinate patch [17,23\u201327] for surface states [28,29], eigenvalues bounded by unity for the\ndefining matrix of a squeezed state [30,31] and more [32]. The asymptotic behavior of level\ntruncation coefficients is another criterion. In fact, one of the justifications for considering\nthe first term of Schnabl's tachyon solution (1.3)2 is to ensure a relatively fast decay of the\ncoefficients.\nWe do not know how to define the space of string fields on which we should be able to\ncontract the solution. Rather, we follow the common wisdom and check the contraction of\nthe equations of motion with the solutions themselves [14, 33, 34]. That is, we show that\nthe tachyon and gauge solutions can be added to the list of states for which the equation\nof motion holds,\nh\u03a8\u03bb1 | QB \u03a8\u03bb2 + \u03a8\u03bb2 \u22c6 \u03a8\u03bb2 i = 0 ,\n\n(1.5)\n\nfor any \u03bb1 , \u03bb2 \u2264 1. This is a non trivial generalization of (1.4) since \u03a8\u03bb is not in the \"Fock\nspace\". Moreover, the tachyon solution \u03bb = 1, involves the singular state \u03c8N \u2192\u221e . The\ncorrelation function of this state vanishes with any \"Fock space\" state, yet this state is\n1\n\nWe consider here the space with general ghost number, without the restriction to physical states [16].\nThis term does not contribute to the equation of motion, since in the limit its contraction with Fock\nspace states vanishes.\n2\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n\fclearly not zero. For example,\n\u221a\n3 3\nlim h\u03c8N | \u03c8N \u22c6 \u03c8N i =\n.\nN \u2192\u221e\n2\u03c0\n\n(1.6)\n\nHere, we take the limit N \u2192 \u221e simultaneously for all terms. Taking, for example, N to\ninfinity in the bra while taking 2N to infinity in the ket yields a different result.\nThe derivation of (1.5) also completes Schnabl's proof of Sen's first conjecture [35, 36].\nSchnabl calculated\n3\nh\u03a8| QB \u03a8i = \u2212 2 ,\n(1.7)\n\u03c0\nand assumed (1.5) to get,\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 1\n1\n1\n(1.8)\nh\u03a8| QB \u03a8i + h\u03a8| QB \u03a8 + \u03a8 \u22c6 \u03a8i = \u2212 2 2 .\n2\ngo 2\n3\n2\u03c0 go\nBut a priori there was no justification for assuming (1.5) without an explicit calculation.\nOur calculation shows that his assumption was nevertheless correct.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we evaluate the correlators\nof three \u03c8n 's, which form the building blocks of Schnabl's solutions \u03a8\u03bb . Then, we sum the\nrelevant combinations of such correlators in section 3 to prove our main result, eq. (1.5).\nFinally, we offer some concluding remarks in section 4.\nWhile this work was nearing completion the paper [37] appeared, which overlaps a\nmajor part of this work.\n\n2. The cubic term\nFirst we summarize the results from [2] relevant to our computation. All results are given\nwithout proof. We refer the reader to [2] for further details.\nA standard coordinate for the CFT computations of string theory is the upper half\nplane, with the half unit circle |z| < 1 being our coordinate patch. For SFT computation\nit is useful to change coordinates to a semi infinite cylinder of radius \u03c0, namely C\u03c0 . The\nconformal map to the new coordinates is z\u0303 = tan\u22121 z. Now the coordinate patch is defined\nby the strip \u2212\u03c0/4 < R(z\u0303) < \u03c0/4.\nIt is natural to mode expand primary fields on the cylinder as\n\u00d5h (z\u0303) = tan \u25e6Oh (z) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n\u00d5nh\n.\nz\u0303 n+h\nn=\u2212\u221e\n\n(2.1)\n\nIn this paper we only need to mode expand the energy momentum tensor Tz\u0303 z\u0303 and the b\u0303\nghost\nI\ndz\u0303 n+1\nz\u0303\nTz\u0303 z\u0303 (z\u0303) ,\n(2.2)\nLn = tan \u25e6Ln =\n2\u03c0i\nI\ndz\u0303 n+1\nz\u0303\nb\u0303(z\u0303) .\n(2.3)\nBn = tan \u25e6bn =\n2\u03c0i\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\n\fThe \u03c8n terms of the solution can be written as wedge states |n + 2i with c\u0303 ghost insertions\nand the B0 + B0\u2020 operator,\n\u03c8n =\n\nh\n2 \u2020\n\u03c0n\n\u03c0n \u03c0n\n\u03c0\u0010\n\u03c0n \u0011i\n\u2020\nc\u0303(\u2212\n(B\n+\nB\n)c\u0303(\u2212\nU\nU\n)c\u0303(\n)\n+\n)\n+\nc\u0303(\n) |0i ,\n0\nn+2\n0\n\u03c0 2 n+2\n4\n4\n2\n4\n4\n\nwhere\nUn+2 =\n\n\u0012\n\n2\nn+2\n\n\u0013L 0\n\n,\n\n\u0010 n\n\u0011\n\u2020\nUn+2\nUn+2 = exp \u2212 (L0 + L\u20200 ) .\n2\n\n(2.4)\n\n(2.5)\n\nIgnoring for a moment the (B0 + B0\u2020 ) operator, the star multiplication of the above states\nis straightforward, using the equation\nUr\u2020 Ur \u03c6\u0303(x\u03031 ) * * * \u03c6\u0303(x\u0303n ) |0i \u22c6 Us\u2020 Us \u03c8\u0303(\u1ef91 ) * * * \u03c8\u0303(\u1ef9m ) |0i =\nUt\u2020 Ut \u03c6\u0303(x\u03031 +\n\n(2.6)\n\n\u03c0(s \u2212 1)\n\u03c0(s \u2212 1)\n\u03c0(r \u2212 1)\n\u03c0(r \u2212 1)\n) * * * \u03c6\u0303(x\u0303n +\n)\u03c8\u0303(\u1ef91 \u2212\n) * * * \u03c8\u0303(\u1ef9m \u2212\n) |0i ,\n4\n4\n4\n4\n\nwhere t = r + s \u2212 1.

The equation of motion\nSchnabl showed that the equation of motion holds when contracted with Fock space states.\nIn this section we demonstrate that it also holds when contracted with any of the solutions.\nThe first term in (1.3) is the problematic one since it is naively zero but still contributes to\nthe action. We show that all combinations of the tachyon and gauge solutions satisfy the\nequation of motion. For the gauge solutions this seems redundant since they do not have\nthe problematic \u03c8N term. Then, this calculation is just an extra check that comes for free\nwith the main result.\nWe start with the diagonal sum over constant p = m + k + 2\np\u22122X\nstep 2\nr=\u2212p+2\n\n\u2202m \u2202k h\u03c8n | \u03c8m \u22c6 \u03c8k i ,\n\nwhere r = m \u2212 k.

(3.4)\n\nSome trigonometry shows that this is equal to the kinetic term calculated by Schnabl,\n\u2202p h\u03c8n | QB \u03c8p\u22121 i =\n\np\u22122X\nstep 2\nr=\u2212p+2\n\n\u2202m \u2202k h\u03c8n | \u03c8m \u22c6 \u03c8k i .\n\n(3.5)\n\nTherefore, when plugging \u03a8\u03bb into the equation of motion, the coefficient of \u03bbp is zero. This\nresult is independent of n. Thus,\nh\u03a8\u03bb1 | QB \u03a8\u03bb2 + \u03a8\u03bb2 \u22c6 \u03a8\u03bb2 i = 0 ,\n\n(3.6)\n\nfor \u03bb1 , \u03bb2 < 1. Combining this with Schnabl's result on the vanishing of the kinetic term\nfor the pure gauge solution, we see that the cubic term in the action also vanishes.\nFor the cubic term of the tachyon solution we need to calculate four terms. The first\nterm is,\n\u0010 2\u03c0 \u0011 3\u221a3\n3\n=\n.\n(3.7)\nlim h\u03c8N | \u03c8N \u22c6 \u03c8N i = sin\nN \u2192\u221e\n\u03c0\n3\n2\u03c0\nThe second term involves a sum that in the limit N \u2192 \u221e can be transformed into a\nRiemann integral, giving exactly the same result as the first term,\n\u221a\nZ 1\n3 3\ndx\u2202x h\u03c8N | \u03c8N \u22c6 \u03c8xN i =\nlim\n.\n(3.8)\nN \u2192\u221e 0\n2\u03c0\nThe third term involves two sums that, again, can be transformed into integrals,\n\u221a\nZ 1 Z 1\n3 3\n.\ndy\u2202x \u2202y h\u03c8N | \u03c8xN \u22c6 \u03c8yN i =\ndx\nlim\nN \u2192\u221e 0\n2\u03c0\n0\n\n(3.9)\n\nThe fourth term involves three sums, but these sums cannot be transformed into an integral\nnear the origin. Still, we calculate the cubic integral,\n\u221a\nZ 1 Z 1 Z 1\n3 3\n,\n(3.10)\ndz\u2202x \u2202y \u2202z h\u03c8zN | \u03c8xN \u22c6 \u03c8yN i =\ndy\ndx\nlim\nN \u2192\u221e 0\n2\u03c0\n0\n0\nbut replace the result of the integral with a sum for the corner of the cube x + y + z < 1.\nLuckily, we already have performed this sum for the pure gauge calculation and it is\nzero (3.5, 3.6). All that is left is to subtract the integral for this illegal domain,\nlim\n\nZ\n\nN \u2192\u221e 0\n\n1\n\ndx\n\nZ\n\n1\u2212x\n\ndy\n0\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n1\u2212y\u2212x\n\ndz\u2202x \u2202y \u2202z h\u03c8zN | \u03c8xN \u22c6 \u03c8yN i =\n\n\u20136\u2013\n\n3\n.\n\u03c02\n\n(3.11)\n\n\fAmazingly, all the other contributions cancel and we are only left with this last contribution\nfrom the illegal domain,\n3\nh\u03a8| \u03a8 \u22c6 \u03a8i = 2 .\n(3.12)\n\u03c0\nTogether with Schnabl's result for the kinetic term we get that the equation of motion\nholds when contracted with the solution itself,\nh\u03a8| QB \u03a8 + \u03a8 \u22c6 \u03a8i = 0 .\n\n(3.13)\n\nThis also completes the proof of Sen's first conjecture (1.8).\nWe have also checked that the equation of motion for the tachyon solution holds when\ncontracted with a gauge solution and that the equation of motion for the gauge solution\nholds when contracted with the tachyon solution.\n\n4. Conclusions\nWe showed that Schnabl's tachyon solution of string field theory is valid in the sense that\nit solves the equation of motion even when contracted with itself. Lacking a definition for\nthe space of string states, our check gives a good indication that this state is well behaved.\nIt is easy to generalize our calculation to see that this result is independent of the\nrelative regularization of the bra and the ket states. Instead of integrating over a cube,\nwe now have to integrate over a box. The result of the integral will be different, but these\nintegrals cancel each other. The only non trivial contribution is from the corner of the cube,\neq. (3.11). Now, we will take a corner from the box, but of the same shape, giving the\nsame contribution. Schnabl's calculation of the kinetic term can be described in the same\nway as integrating over the square and then correcting for the lower triangle. Therefore,\nthe kinetic and cubic terms again cancel.\nTo conclude, using a correct regularization for the tachyon solution is crucial for obtaining the right state. Yet after regularization, the state we get seems to be well behaved\nunder all our tests, to the extent that the regularization we used to get this state is irrelevant.\nThis work bridges a gap left in [2]. We believe that it will prove useful for a better\nunderstanding of Schnabl's construction and for further applications thereof. We hope that\nit would also serve in the search for the space of string fields.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank Emil Akhmedov, Sergey Frolov, Martin Schnabl, Ashoke Sen and\nStefan Theisen for discussions.
