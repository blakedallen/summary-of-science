We predict the upper bound on the dissociation temperatures of different\nquarkonium states.\n\nIn a recent paper [1] we analyzed in detail the quarkonium spectral functions. This\nanalysis has shown that spectral functions calculated using potential model for the nonrelativistic Green's function combined with perturbative QCD can describe the available\nlattice data on quarkonium correlators both at zero and finite temperature in QCD with\nno light quarks [1]. Charmonia, however, were found to be dissolved at temperatures\nsignificantly lower than quoted in lattice QCD studies, and in contradiction with other\nclaims made in recent years from different potential model studies. In [2] we extended\nthe analysis to real QCD with one strange quark and two light quarks using new lattice\nQCD data on quark anti-.quark free energy obtained with small quark masses [3].\nHere we briefly outline the main results of the analysis of [2], in particular the\nestimate for the upper limit on the dissociation temperatures. There is an uncertainty\nin choosing the quark-antiquark potential at finite temperature. In [2] we considered\ntwo choices of the potential, both consistent with the lattice data [3]. The more extreme\nchoice, still compatible with lattice data, leads to the largest possible binding energy. In\nthis most binding potential some of the quarkonium states survive above deconfinement,\nbut their strongly temperature-dependent binding energy is significantly reduced. This\nis shown in Fig. 1. Due to the reduced binding energy thermal activation can lead to the\ndissociation of quarkonia, even when the corresponding peak is present in the spectral\nfunction. Knowing the binding energy we estimate the thermal width using the analysis\nof [4]. The expression of the rate of thermal excitation has particularly simple form in\nthe two limiting cases:\ns\n\nT\n4\n(LT )2\nMe\u2212Ebin /T , Ebin \u226b T \u0393(T ) =\n, Ebin \u226a T . (1)\n\u0393(T ) =\n3\u03c0\nL 2\u03c0M\nHere M is the quarkonium mass, L is the size of the spatial region of the potential,\ngiven by the distance from the average quarkonium radius to the top of the potential,\ni.e. L = rmed \u2212hr 2 i1/2 , rmed being the effective range of the potential [2]. Using the above\nformulas we estimate the thermal width of charmonium and bottomonium states.

Upper limit of the binding energy (left) and the width (right) of quarkonium\nstates. For better visibility, in the limit of small binding, the open squares show the\nwidth of the 1S bottomonium state multiplied by six.\n\nin the deconfined phase Ebin < T the 1S charmonium and 2S and 1P bottomonium\nstates are in the regime of weak binding, and their width is large, as shown in Fig. 1.\nThe 1S bottomonium is strongly bound for T < 1.6Tc and its thermal width is smaller\nthan 40MeV. For T > 1.6Tc , however, even the 1S bottomonium states is in the weak\nbinding regime resulting in the large increase of the width, see Fig. 1. When the thermal\nwidth is significantly larger than the binding energy no peak structure will be present\nin the spectral functions, even though the simple potential model calculation predicts\na peak. Therefore, we define a conservative dissociation temperature by the condition\n\u0393 > 2Ebin . The obtained dissociation temperatures are summarized in Table .\nFrom the table it is clear that all quarkonium states, except the 1S bottomonium,\nwill melt at temperatures considerably smaller than previous estimates, and will for\ncertain be dissolved in the matter produced in heavy ion collision at LHC. Furthermore,\nit is likely that at energy densities reached at the LHC a large fraction of the 1S\nbottomonium states will also dissolve. It has to be seen to what extent these findings will\nresult in large RAA suppression at LHC. For this more information about initial state\neffects is needed. Moreover, the spectral functions are strongly enhanced over the free\ncase even when quarkonium states are dissolved [1, 2] indicating significant correlations\nbetween the heavy quark and antiquark. Therefore, one should take into account also\nthe possibility of quarkonium regeneration from correlated initial quark-antiquark pairs.\nstate \u03c7c\n\u03c8\u2032\nJ/\u03c8\n\u03a5\u2032\n\u03c7b\n\u03a5\nTdis \u2264 Tc \u2264 Tc 1.2Tc 1.2Tc 1.3Tc 2Tc\nTable 1.
