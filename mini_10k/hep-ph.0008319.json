A. Chishtie and V. Elias\nDepartment of Applied Mathematics\nUniversity of Western Ontario\nLondon, Ontario N6A 5B7\nCanada\nAbstract\nThe three-loop contribution to the M S single-Higgs-doublet standardmodel cross-section \u03c3(WL+ WL\u2212 \u2192 ZL ZL ) at s = (5MH )2 is estimated\nvia least-squares matching of the asymptotic Pad\u00e9-approximant prediction of the next order term, a procedure that has been previously applied to QCD corrections to correlation functions and decay amplitudes.\nIn contrast to these prior applications, the expansion parameter for the\nWL+ WL\u2212 \u2192 ZL ZL process is the non-asymptotically-free quartic scalarfield coupling of the standard model, suggesting that the least-squares\nmatching be performed over the \"infrared\" \u03bc2 \u2264 s region of the scale\nparameter. All three coefficients of logarithms within the three-loop term\nobtained by such matching are found to be within 6.6% relative error of\ntheir true values, as determined via renormalization-group methods. Surprisingly, almost identical results are obtained by performing the least\nsquares matching over the \u03bc2 \u2265 s region.\n\nWithin standard-model single-Higgs-doublet electroweak physics, the crosssection for the scattering of two longitudinal W's into two longitudinal Z's at\nvery high energy takes the form\n8\u03c0 3\nH[s, L(\u03bc), g(\u03bc)],\n9s\nwhere the scale-sensitive portion of the cross-section [1],\n\u03c3[s, L(\u03bc), g(\u03bc)] =\n\n(1)\n\nH[s, L(\u03bc), g(\u03bc)] = g 2 (\u03bc) {1 + [\u22124L(\u03bc) \u2212 10.0]g(\u03bc)\n\u0013\u0013\u0015\n\u0012\n\u0014\n\u0012\ns\n2\n2\ng 2 (\u03bc)\n+\n12L (\u03bc) + 68.667L(\u03bc) + 93.553 + ln\n2\n3\nMH\n\u0002\n\u0003\n+\nc3 L3 (\u03bc) + c2 L2 (\u03bc) + c1 L(\u03bc) + c0 g 3 (\u03bc) + ... ,\n(2)\n\ndepends on the renormalization scale \u03bc explicitly through the logarithm\nL(\u03bc) \u2261 ln(\u03bc2 /s)\n\n(3)\n\nand implicitly through the M S quartic scalar-field coupling\ng(\u03bc) = 6 \u03bbMS (\u03bc)/16\u03c0 2 .\n1\n\n(4)\n\n\fThe three-loop coefficients {c0 , c1 , c2 , c3 } in (2) are presently unknown. The\nfactor of MH appearing explicitly in the two-loop term calculated in [1] is a\nscale-independent pole mass; the coefficients {c0 , c1 , c2 , c3 } can also exhibit dependence on this mass without acquiring additional \u03bc-dependence.\nIn this note, we utilise asymptotic Pad\u00e9-approximant methods to predict\nthese four coefficients. Such methods have already been applied to predicting\nnext-order terms within the renormalization group functions of QCD [2,3,4],\nsupersymmetric QCD [2,5], and massive scalar field theory [3,4,6], as well as\nnext-order QCD corrections to scalar and vector current correlation functions\n[4,7] and various decay processes [8,9,10]. In all of these applications, the Pad\u00e9estimation procedures are tested (with surprising success) against either those\nhigher-order terms already known from explicit calculation, such as renormalization group functions in scalar field theories [11,12], QCD [13], and supersymmetric QCD [14], or against those coefficients of logarithms [such as {c1 , c2 , c3 }\nin (2)] which can be extracted via renormalization group methods [7,8,9,10]. Below, we shall apply the latter testing procedure to estimates of the next-order\nterms {c1 , c2 , c3 } in the M S cross-section (1).\nGiven a perturbative series of the form 1 + R1 g + R2 g 2 + R3 g 3 + ... where\nR3 is not known, as is the case in (2), asymptotic Pad\u00e9-approximant methods\ncan be employed to show that [4]\nR3 \u223c\n=\n\n2R23\n.\nR13 + R1 R2\n\n(5)\n\nThis result is, of course, contingent upon the field-theoretical series exhibiting\nappropriate asymptotic behaviour. Its derivation (explicitly presented in [8])\nfollows from the O(1/N ) error anticipated from an [N |1] Pad\u00e9-approximant\nprediction of RN +2 [15], a semi-empirical behaviour which is seen to characterise\na number of field-theoretical applications even when N is small.\nFor the case of the series (2), however, R1 is linear in L and R2 is quadratic\nin L. Consequently, the prediction (5) for R3 corresponds to a rational function of L incompatible with the degree-3 polynomial in L anticipated from (2).\nClearly, a procedure is required by which predictions for the polynomial coefficients {c0 , c1 , c2 , c3 } in (2) can be extracted from (5). In past applications\nwhere the same problem arises [7,8,9,10], one method employed is a least-squares\nmatching of (5) to the form R3 = c0 + c1 L(\u03bc) + c2 L2 (\u03bc) + c3 L3 (\u03bc) over the full\nperturbative domain of \u03bc. For QCD calculations this domain is ultraviolet; e.g.\nin estimating three-loop QCD corrections to B \u2192 Xu l\u2212 \u03bd l the matching is over\nthe ultraviolet domain \u03bc \u2265 mb (\u03bc) [8]. For the expression (2), in which the\nperturbative expansion parameter is the non-asymptotically-free quartic scalar\ncoupling \u03bbMS (\u03bc), the appropriate domain for such a least-squares matching is\ninfrared.\nThus, to obtain predicted values for {c0 , c1 , c2 , c3 } for a given choice of MH ,\nwe choose a least-squares matching over the region \u03bc2 \u2264 s, or alternatively\n0 < w \u2264 1, where w \u2261 \u03bc2 /s is the argument of the logarithm (3). From (2) and\n(5), this matching is achieved by minimizing the function\n2\n\n\f\u03c72 (c0 , c1 , c2 , c3 ) \u2261\n\u0014\n\u00152\nZ 1\n2R23 (w)\n2\n3\ndw\n\u2212 c0 \u2212 c1 ln(w) \u2212 c2 ln (w) \u2212 c3 ln (w) (6)\nR13 (w) + R1 (w)R2 (w)\nwmin\nwith respect to c0 , c1 , c2 , c3 , where R1 (w) and R2 (w) are explicitly given in (2):\nR1 (w) = \u22124ln(w) \u2212 10.0,\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0013\n\u0012\n2\ns\nR2 (w) = 12ln2(w) + 68.667ln(w) + 93.553 + ln\n.\n2\n3\nMH\n\n(7)\n(8)\n\nThe lower bound of integration wmin in (6) would ordinarily be zero to encompass the full \u03bc2 \u2264 s range. However, we are compelled to consider a nonzero\nvalue of wmin in order to avoid any integrand poles, as discussed below. The\nexpressions (1) and (2) are stated in ref. [1]\u221ato be accurate (within single-digit\n> 5M . Although the projected\npercent errors) only in the high-energy limit s \u223c\nH\n2\nlinear and quadratic dependence of c1 and c0 on ln(s/MH\n) could, in principle,\n1\nbe extracted via Pad\u00e9 methods, the relatively small coefficient of this logarithm\nin the previous-order term (8) necessarily implies a similar insensitivity to this\nlogarithm in Pad\u00e9 estimates of next-order terms. Consequently, we restrict our\nanalysis here to the s = (5MH )2 kinematic boundary of applicability for (1)\nand (2). With this choice, the integrand of (6) acquires singularities at 0.0552,\n0.0821, and 0.0896. Consequently, we choose wmin = 0.09 to include virtually\nall of the integrable infrared region, and we find that\n\u03c72 (c0 , c1 , c2 , c3 )\n=\n+\n\u2212\n+\n\n248033 + 813.779c0 \u2212 332.772c1 + 244.574c2 \u2212 242.664c3\n0.91c20 \u2212 1.38657c0c1 + 1.72946c0c2\n\n2.67527c0c3 + 0.864732c21 \u2212 2.67527c1c2 + 4.64965c1c3\n(9)\n2.32482c22 \u2212 8.67669c2c3 + 8.48631c23\n\nBy then optimizing (9) with respect to c0 , c1 , c2 , c3 , we obtain the following Pad\u00e9\npredictions for these coefficients:\nad\u00e9\nad\u00e9\nad\u00e9\nad\u00e9\n= \u2212896, cP\n= \u2212889, cP\n= \u2212288, cP\n= \u221230.5.\ncP\n2\n3\n0\n1\n\n(10)\n\nAs noted earlier, the true values of the coefficients c1 , c2 , c3 can be extracted\nvia the scale-invariance of the physical cross-section (1):\nO = \u03bc2\n\ndH\n\u2202H\n\u2202H\n[s, L(\u03bc), g(\u03bc)] =\n+ \u03b2(g)\n,\nd\u03bc2\n\u2202L\n\u2202g\n\nwhere [11]\n\u03b2(g) = 2g 2 \u2212\n\n13 3\ng + 27.803g 4 + ... .\n3\n\n(11)\n\n(12)\n\n1 In ref. [10], the polynomial dependence of three-loop order terms in H \u2192 gg on the\nlogarithm of the pole-mass ratio MH /Mt is similarly extracted.\n\n3\n\n\fOne can verify that the known terms in (2) satisfy the renormalization-group\nequation (11) to O(g 3 ) and O(g 4 ), as is evident from the series expansions\n\u2202H\n= \u22124g 3 + (24L + 68.667)g 4 + (3c3 L2 + 2c2 L + c1 )g 5 + ... ,\n\u2202L\n\u03b2(g)\n\n\u2202H\n\u2202g\n\n=\n\n4g 3 + (\u221224L \u2212 68.667)g 4 + (96L2 + 601.33L + 934.028\n\n+\n\n2\n5.333ln(s/MH\n))g 5 + ... .\n\n(13)\n\n(14)\n\nWe find upon incorporating O(g 5 ) terms of (13) and (14) into the right-hand\nside of (11) that\nc1\nc2\n\n2\n= \u2212934.028 \u2212 5.333ln(s/MH\n)\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\n2\ns=25MH\n\n\u2212 951.2,\n\n= \u2212300.67, c3 = \u221232.\n\n(15)\n\nThe Pad\u00e9 predictions (10) for c1 , c2 , c3 are respectively seen to be within relative\nerrors of 6.6%, 4.3%, and 4.7% of their true values (15).\nCuriously, the accuracy of these Pad\u00e9 results does not appear to be contin2\ngent upon the matching being performed over the \"infrared\" \u03bc2 < s = 25 MH\nrange, as motivated by the non-asymptotically free character of the scalar field\ncoupling g(\u03bc). Indeed, a potential drawback of fitting over the \u03bc2 \u2264 s (hence,\nw \u2264 1) region, as in (6), is the negativity of ln(w) over the entire range of integration. Since the ci ultimately obtained in (10) are all same-sign (negative),\ncancellations necessarily occur between successive ck lnk (w) terms in the integrand of (6) in the best-fit region of ck parameter-space. To address this issue,\nwe have also performed a fit of the Pad\u00e9-prediction (5) to the third-subleading\norder of (2) over the entire \u03bc2 \u2265 s (i.e. w \u2265 1) region in which ln(w) is positive. This entails integration of the integrand of (6) with appropriately modified\nbounds of integration to encompass the ultraviolet region:\nZ\n\n1\n\nwmin\n\ndw[...]2 \u2192\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\ndw[...]2 .\n\n(16)\n\n1\n\nWe then find that\n\u03c72 (c0 , c1 , c2 , c3 ) = 1.45665 * 107 + 5095.28c0 + 10294.6c1\n\n+ 35519.6c2 + 167166c3 + c20 + 2c0 c1\n+ 4c0 c2 + 12c0 c3 + 2c21 + 12c1 c2 + 48c1 c3\n\n+ 24c22 + 240c2 c3 + 720c23,\n\n(17)\n\nwhich upon optimization, yields values for ck [c0 = \u2212896, c1 = \u2212889, c2 =\n\u2212289 c3 = \u221230.9] that are virtually the same as those listed in (10). The\n4\n\n\fsmall relative errors characterising our Pad\u00e9 estimates of c1 , c2 , c3 are comparable to those characterising Pad\u00e9 estimates of renormalization-group accessible\ncoefficients within next-order QCD corrections to other processes [7,8,9,10], and\nsuggest similar accuracy in the estimated value of the renormalization-group\ninaccessible three-loop coefficient c0 in (10).\nWe therefore conclude that Pad\u00e9-approximant predictions of the next order\ncontribution to W W \u2192 ZZ at very high energies appear to be consistent and\nreliable. It should also be noted that higher order \u03b2-function terms associated\nwith the evolution of the quartic scalar-field coupling constant (4) are themselves accurately predicted by the same asymptotic Pad\u00e9-approximant methods\nemployed above for \u03c3(W W \u2192 ZZ). If we express the \u03b2-function (12) in the\nform\n\u03b2(g) = 2g 2 (1 + R1 g + R2 g 2 + R3 g 3 + ...); R1 = \u221213/6, R2 = 13.915,\n\n(18)\n\nwe predict via (5) that R3 = \u2212133.6, or alternatively, that the predicted next\nterm in the series (12) is \u2212267.2g 5. This is quite close to \u2212266.495g 5, the\ntrue calculated value [11] of the next-order \u03b2-function contribution. Similarly\nclose agreement between the somewhat more complicated asymptotic Pad\u00e9approximant prediction and the explicit calculation of the O(g 6 ) contribution\nto this \u03b2-function is demonstrated in ref. [6].\nThus, the results presented above are an example of how Pad\u00e9 estimation\nprocedures can anticipate next-order contributions whose exact values are obtainable only by lengthy calculation. For the particular process in question, the\ndistinction between two- and three-loop order results is seen to be unimportant\nunless the mass of the (Salam-Weinberg) Higgs field mediating the scattering\nprocess is very large. This is illustrated in Figures 1-3, which compare two loop\nand three loop expressions for the scale sensitive portion (2) of the W W \u2192 ZZ\ncross section (1) for Higgs-field masses of 200, 400, and 600 GeV, respectively.\nOnly for the largest of these three choices is an appreciable difference anticipated\nbetween two- and three-loop order predictions for the cross section.\n\n5\n\n\fFig.1\n\n0.00025\n\n0.0002\n\n0.00015\n\n0.0001\n\n5e\u201305\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n\u03bc\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\nFigure 1: The two-loop (bottom curve) and predicted three-loop (top curve)\nexpressions for the scale-sensitive portion H[s = (5MH )2 ,L(\u03bc),g(\u03bc)] of the crosssection (1) are plotted for Higgs mass MH = 200 GeV.\n\n6\n\n400\n\n\fFig.2\n\n0.01\n\n0.008\n\n0.006\n\n3L\n\n0.004\n\n2L\n\n0.002\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n\u03bc\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\nFigure 2: Comparison of two-loop (2L) and three-loop (3L) expressions, as in\nFigure 1, but with MH = 400 GeV.\n\n7\n\n800\n\n\fFig.3\n\n0.1\n\n0.08\n\n0.06\n\n0.04\n\n3L\n\n0.02\n\n2L\n\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n\u03bc\n\n800\n\n1000\n\nFigure 3: Comparison of two-loop (2L) and three-loop (3L) expressions, as in\nFigure 1, but with MH = 600 GeV.\n\n8\n\n1200\n\n\fAcknowledgment\nVE is grateful for research support from the Natural Sciences and Engineering\nResearch Council of Canada.\n\nReferences\n1.
