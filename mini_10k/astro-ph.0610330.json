Indeed, all of our observations of the Universe are (implicitly) conditional on the fact that we exist. A Universe without observers would never be measured\nfor the simple fact that there would be no one around to make the observations.\nWe can easily conceive Universes where the laws of physics are such as not to\nallow the existence of sentient life. For example, a Universe without an arrow of time\nwould be extremely hostile to the emergence of an organized complexity as required\nby the existence of intelligent observers, because the lack of causality would arguably\nprevent any meaningful anticipation of physical phenomena. Without going to such\nextremes, we might speculate about what the Universe would look like if the numerical\nvalue of physical constants were different from what is observed. In particular, a large\nnumber of so\u2013called \"anthropic coincidences\" have been pointed out regarding our own\nUniverse (see e.g. [1] and references therein): it appears that any small deviation from\nhighly fine\u2013tuned values of physical constants in our Universe would have catastrophic\nconsequences for the emergence of life as we know it.\nThere are a few different viewpoints as to what meaning we should assign to the idea\nthat physical constants (such as Newton's constant or the fine structure constant) could\nbe different from what we observe. The traditional approach of physics has been to explain the laws of nature from fundamental principles, such as the existence and breaking\nof symmetries. In working out a final theory of everything, one might have hoped that the\nstructure of physical reality would naturally emerge as the unique logically and mathematically consistent possibility. In this case, the value of natural constants would be\nuniquely determined by some deep, underlying principle. The imminent realization of\n\n\fthis positivistic hope seems to have receded as string theory has failed to deliver such a\nunique picture of fundamental physics. Indeed, the string landscape, with its large number of different vacua, points to a vast number of possible Universes, each with different\nproperties, for example the values of fundamental constants. Opinions diverge as to the\nphysical reality of such alternative realizations of the Universe. We might think of this\nensemble as causally disconnected patches of this Universe, as separate sub\u2013universes\n(a.k.a. the multiverse) or as a superposition of states (as in quantum cosmology). It seems\nto us that this problem is akin to the (unresolved) interpretation of measurement in quantum mechanics, where the physical reality of the many\u2013worlds picture remains unclear.\nThis has lead some distinguished scientists (such as the late E.T. Jaynes) to cast doubts\non the completeness of modern quantum theory.\n\nANTHROPIC REASONING\nOne of the most outstanding problems in fundamental physics is to explain the incredibly\nlow energy density of the vacuum compared to the characteristic Planck energy density\n\u2013 the cosmological constant problem. Lacking an explanations from fundamental arguments, much effort has been devoted to investigate the possibility of understanding the\ncosmological constant values in terms of selection effects. This goes usually under the\nname of \"anthropic principle\", introduced by Brandon Carter [2] as a necessary limitation to the Copernican principle that we do not hold a special place in the Universe. The\nargument first given by Weinberg [3] is that in realizations of the Universe with too large\na value of the cosmological constant structure formation cannot proceed, and hence life\nas we know it will not emerge. Although Weinberg's original upper limit of the value of\nthe cosmological constant energy density \u03c1\u039b is more that 2 orders of magnitude larger\nthan what is observed, refined versions of this argument claim to successfully \"predict\"\n4 \u2248 10\u2212123 [4, 5, 6].\n\u03c1\u039b comparable to what is actually observed, ie \u03c1\u039b /MPl\nThe rigorous translation of such selection effects in a probabilistic statement is far\nfrom trivial. Let us focus on the case where only the cosmological constant \u039b is allowed\nto vary (see [7, 8, 9] for a discussion of how the situation changes when more parameters\nare varied). In a Bayesian language, we can write for the posterior probability for \u039b given\nthat intelligent life exist,\nPr(\u039b|life) \u221d Pr(\u039b)Pr(life|\u039b),\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Pr(\u039b) is the prior probability distribution function (pdf) and Pr(life|\u039b) is the\nlikelihood for \"life\" given a certain value for \u039b, thus encapsulating the selection effects.\nThe proportionality constant (the \"evidence\") is independent of \u039b and can be ignored\nfor the purpose of this discussion. Let us discuss the prior and likelihood in turn.\n\nThe prior distribution\nThe whole point of the anthropic program is to go from a flat(ish) prior pdf \u2013 either\ndescribing insufficient knowledge (from the Bayesian perspective) or assumptions about\n\n\fthe frequency of realizations of a fundamental theory (frequentist) \u2013 to a strongly peaked\nposterior, hopefully centered around the observed value for \u039b.\nBut to start with, how are we to assign the prior? Most of the literature has interpreted\nthe prior in a frequentist sense, and calculated in various way the relative number of outcomes for a large number of realizations. However, the very concept of probability as a\nlimiting frequency of outcomes, though natural when applied to repeatable experiments,\nis not obviously appropriate to describe the Universe as a whole. One way out of the\nproblem that we have only one Universe to study is to make use of ergodic arguments\nin order to derive Pr(\u039b) [9]. This is an approach whose validity remain unproven. A\nmore radical point of view is the Multiverse scenario, according to which there is an infinite collection of, by definition inaccessible, universes. It is difficult to see how vastly\nincreasing the number of universes could help determine the properties of the one universe we actually can observe, i.e. our own. This approach hardly seems economical in\nterms of explanatory power. From an operational point of view, the idea of a \"random\"\ndistribution of values for \u039b is meaningless unless a mechanism for the generation of the\ndifferent values is also specified.\nSome of these conceptual difficulties might be addressed by taking a fully Bayesian\napproach to the problem, and understanding the prior as an expression of our state\nof knowledge before we see the data, in this case represented by the observation that\nsentient life does exist in the Universe. Here, however, we are mainly concerned with\nissue arising from the choice of the likelihood function, to which now we turn out\nattention.\n\nThe likelihood function: dependence on reference class\nIn order to compute Pr(\u039b|life) in Eq. (1), we need to specify exactly the meaning of\n\"life\". This is a fundamental issue that all too often is glossed over, by simply using a\nmore readily calculated surrogate \u2013 the physical number density of galaxies, or more\nprecisely the collapsed gas fraction. One then assumes that the density of observers is\nproportional to this quantity. So if \"life\" really stands for \"intelligent observers just like\nus\", we need to ask ourselves what exactly counts as an observer. Do future generations\nof humans count as separate observers or not \u2013 after all, we could pass on the information\nwe gathered to them. Or perhaps, the whole human civilization ought to be counted as\none single, collective observer? Do the ancient Egyptians count as separate observers?\nWhat if past observers die out, or if they forget previous measurements?\nThese considerations can be put in a more formal way by using the concept of a\nreference class of observers. The reference class contains all observers that are \"just like\nyou\" in all relevant respects. It is clear that the resulting posterior pdf will depend on\nthe chosen reference class, as shown by [10]. In other words, the choice of reference\nclass is equivalent to giving different probabilistic weights to different realizations of\nthe Universe (in a frequentist perspective). Here we present a specific example of this\neffect \u2013 we argue that there are many plausible weighting factors (or reference classes)\nfor universes, and that the answers to questions such as the expected value of \u039b depends\nenormously on the weighting. In [11] we introduced a weighting scheme based on the\n\n\fmaximal number of allowed observations (MANO) in a universe. This quantity is clearly\nrelevant to the expected value of a constant, say \u039b, since a value that allows more\nobservations to be carried out will be measured more often. It also has the advantage of\nbeing independent of how one defines constant time hypersurfaces. As we show below,\nthe resulting posterior pdf for \u039b is peaked arbitrarily close to 0, thus giving a completely\ndifferent result that the usual weighting by number density of galaxies.\n\nMAXIMUM NUMBER OF ALLOWED OBSERVATIONS\nWe wish to evaluate the probability that an observer will measure his or her universe to\nhave a vacuum energy density no smaller than what we measure in our Universe. As the\nselection function for observing \u039b in the different realizations we put forward the total\nnumber of observations that observers can potentially carry out over the entire life of that\nuniverse (called MANO for brevity, for \"Maximum Allowed Number of Observations\").\nThis maximum number is the product of two factors \u2013 the number of observers and\nthe maximum number of observations that each observer can make. As argued above,\nthere is a fundamental difficulty in determining the total number of observers in a given\nreference class, since we can neither compute nor measure it. However, in the limit\nwhere observers are rare (in a way we quantify below) the anthropic prediction for the\nprobability of observing \u039b will be independent of the density of observers. Below we\nfocus on the second factor \u2013 the maximum number of observations that each observer\ncan make \u2013 and offer some further comments about the many observers scenario in the\nnext section.\n\nRare observers scenario\nFor illustrative purposes and computability, we hold fixed all parameters of the\nuniverse other than the vacuum energy density, considering flat Lemaitre-FriedmannRobertson-Walker universes with exactly the same matter and radiation contents and the\nsame fluctuations as our own at the time of matter\u2013radiation equality. This is a common setup in the literature. We consider only the case \u039b > 0. This restriction can only\nincrease the probability of observing \u039b equal to or greater than the observed one, so\nwe should interpret the probability we calculate as an upper limit. We refer to [11] for\nfurther details.\nIn a \u039b > 0 universe, the minimum temperature at which a system (e.g. an observer)\n1/2\ncan operate is the de Sitter temperature TdS = \u03c1\u039b /(2\u03c0 MPl). (Refrigerated subsystems\ncan run cooler, but the energy consumption of the refrigeration more than compensates).\nAs discussed in detail in [12] and [13], the maximum energy such an observer can collect\nis given by\n1 4\u03c0\n[(\u03b7\u221e \u2212 \u03b7\u22c6 )a\u22c6 ]3 \u03c1m (a\u22c6 )\nEmax \u2243\n(2)\n8 3\nwhere \u03b7\u22c6 is the value of conformal time when the observer starts collecting energy and\na(\u03b7\u221e ) = \u221e. The factor of \u223c 1/8 arises because we assume that the decision to collect\n\n\fthe energy is made by the observer at the origin, and must then be communicated out\ninto space. During this time-consuming process, most (\u223c 7/8) of the volume currently\nwithin the apparent horizon is swept out of it by the accelerating expansion. (There is an\nadditional suppression factor of \u223c 1/8 if one wishes to transport the energy back to the\ncentral location, rather than use it in situ) We will ignore the O(1) geometric prefactors\nand focus on the functional dependence. In the \"rare observers\" scenario we assume that\nthere is at most one observer within the comoving volume accessible to each from the\ntime that they first become capable of making observations onward, otherwise there is a\ncut\u2013off to the maximum collectible energy introduced by competition among observers\n(see below).\nThe number of thermodynamic processes (such as observations of \u039b) an observer can\ncarry out is maximized if the observer saves up Emax until the universe has reached the\nde Sitter temperature. Thus\nNmax \u2264 Emax /kB TdS .\n(3)\nFollowing the arguments given above, we adopt Nmax as a probabilistic weight in the\nselection function, and since we have assumed a flat prior pdf in \u039b we have that the\nposterior Pr(\u039b|life) \u221d Nmax .\nThe asymptotic limit for Nmax can be calculated analytically (see [11]), and one finds\n\u001a2\n(\u03b10 /\u03b1\u22c6 )3 R\u22122 , R \u226b 1,\n3\n(4)\nPr(R|\u03b1\u22c6 ) \u221d\n54R\u22121 , R \u226a 1.\nHere we have introduced R as the ratio of the value of the cosmological constant in\nan hypothetical universe with respect to the value it takes in our own, R \u2261 \u039b/\u039b0 . The\nquantity \u03b1\u22c6 is the value of the scale factor when smart observers start collecting energy\n(normalized to matter\u2013radiation equality), and it is conveniently expressed as\n\u0010 \u221a\n\u221a \u00112/3\n,\n\u03b1\u22c6 = \u03b10 (3R)\u22121/3 sinh ln( 3 + 2) R\u03c4\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03c4 \u2261 t\u22c6 /t0 is the physical time until observers smart enough to begin collecting\nenergy arise, in units of 13.7 Gyrs, the age at which such observers (us, or our descendants) are known to have arisen in our Universe. However, the normalization integral in\n(4) diverges logarithmically, and is dominated by the minimum cut\u2013off value, Rmin , if\nsuch exists. In the landscape scenario (see e.g. [14] and references therein), for instance,\nthe number of vacua is estimated to be of order 10500 , and therefore the corresponding\n4 , or R\n\u2212377 .\nminimum value of \u039b can perhaps be taken to be \u039bmin \u223c 10\u2212500 MPl\nmin \u223c 10\nOne could of course go from (4) to a joint posterior for R and \u03c4 , but this would involve\nthe specification of a prior on \u03c4 , thus introducing further uncertainty in the problem,\ngiven our ignorance about when smart observers are likely to arise. We prefer instead to\nevaluate the posterior probability of R > 1, equivalent to the probability of measuring\n\u039b > \u039b0 , for a few representative choices of \u03c4 . With the above choice of cut\u2013off value,\nand for a few values of \u03c4 = 0.1, 1, 10 we obtain a very small probability of observing a\nvalue of \u039b as large or large than in our Universe, and it falls further the longer it takes\nfor intelligent observers to arise (ie, for larger \u03c4 ). For \u03c4 = 1 we obtain a probability of\n9 * 10\u22126, which drops to 4 * 10\u221212 for \u03c4 = 10. The situation is only marginally better in the\n\n\foptimistic situation where intelligent observers evolve before one\u2013tenth of the current\nage of the universe, since Pr(R > 1|\u03c4 = 0.1) = 5 * 10\u22124.\nIt is worth noting that the conclusion that low \u039b is favored does not depend on the\nobserver civilization foolishly squandering all of its resources on observing \u039b. Rather, it\nrequires only that civilizations spend a fraction of their resources doing so which does\nnot depend on (or at least does not decrease with) \u039b. One might wonder why a civilization would bother \"observing\" \u039b more than once. First, since we have calculated\nthe maximum number of thermodynamic processes, we must understand that \"observing\" should be rather broadly defined. In particular it would include \"remembering\" the\ncosmological constant (i.e. consulting permanent records), or communicating the value\nof the cosmological constant to other members of the civilization, including one's descendants. Thus, it would actually be difficult for a civilization to stop \"observing\" the\ncosmological constant. Secondly, there is actual motivation for continuing to observe the\nrate of expansion to check to see if the dark energy density has changed, since this alone\nwill allow one to take advantage of the decline in the de Sitter temperature to prolong\nthe civilization's existence.\n\nMany observers scenario\nSo far, we have worked exclusively in the rare observer limit \u2013 where each intelligent\nobserver is free to collect all of the energy within their apparent horizon without competition from other observers. One might imagine that as the density of observers rose,\none would mitigate the preference for low \u039b, but the case is by no means so clear. If the\nobserver density is high, then the observers will come into competition for the universe's\n(or at least their Hubble volume's) same scarce resources. Our own historical experience\nis that such competition never leads to negotiated agreement to use those resources as\nconservatively as possible. More likely is that the competition for resources will lead to\nsome substantial fraction of those resources being squandered in warfare until only one\nof the observers remains. Moreover, unless they eliminate all possible competitors, observers will continue to spend their finite supply of energy at a rate exceeding that which\nwould otherwise be necessary. What is clear is that given our inability to predict or measure either the density of intelligent observers or the way in which they would behave\nwhen they meet, our ability to use anthropic reasoning can only be further compromised.\nIndeed, it is (not surprisingly) impossible to escape the psychology and sociology\nquestions when the density of observers is high. No doubt one could perform some\nparticular calculation of such a scenario \u2013 assuming, for example, that all the observers\nagree to use only their local resources and not to poach on each other, or by drawing\ninspiration from a game\u2013theory approach about competitors evolving in an environment\nwith limited resources. But any such assumptions would be rather strong, and it would be\neffectively impossible to test. The point is, that since such questions inevitably intrude,\none cannot do a meaningful calculation. But certainly the anthropic prediction will\ndepend on the answer to these effectively unknowable questions.\nFinally, in our MANO approach we must specify what fraction of its available resources a civilization would devote to measuring the cosmological constant. We have\n\n\fused here as measure the maximum possible number of observations, but the argument\nwould be unchanged if civilizations used only a fixed fraction (however small) of that\nmaximum. Of course a civilization would be stupid to spend all its energy in this task,\nand clearly the answer one gets in terms of the posterior pdf for \u039b depends on the fraction\nof the energy consumption of the civilization as a function of time. We have assumed\nthat the fraction is zero until the ambient temperature reaches the de Sitter temperature\nand then a constant (it need not be 100% \u2013 the probability distribution for \u039b would remain unchanged if it were any other constant value.) Since we are not trying to prove\nthat MANO is the correct way to weight universes, we make no attempt to justify that\nthis is the correct functional dependence of the observation rate on time, just that it is\na perfectly reasonable dependence. Other observation strategies \u2013 such as observe once\nand never observe again \u2013 may also be perfectly reasonable. One could also argue that\ninstead of counting every observation one should count only once each observation in\na causally connected region. But this is part of the problem \u2013 can we ever hope to understand, nay predict, the psychology of all intelligent civilizations from first principles,\npredict which psychology will produce the longest lasting (\"dominant\") civilizations,\nand so infer the distribution of observation\u2013strategies that would result? We fear not.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe have argued that anthropic reasoning suffers from the problem that the peak of the\nselection function depends on the details of what exactly one chooses to condition upon\n\u2013 be it the number of observers, the fraction of baryons in halos or the total number of\nobservations observers can carry out. A weighting scheme according to the maximum\nnumber of possible observations implies that the expected value of \u039b is logarithmically\nclose to its minimum allowed non\u2013negative value (or is zero or negative), contrary\nto the usual result. In its usual formulation, the anthropic principle does not offer\nany motivation \u2013 from either fundamental particle physics or probability theory \u2013 to\nprefer one weighting scheme over another, and in particular one that does not lead to\nparadoxical or self\u2013contradictory conclusions of the type described in [10]. Lacking\neither fundamental motivations for the required weighting, or other testable predictions,\nanthropic reasoning cannot be used to explain the value of the cosmological constant.\nWe expect that similar statements apply to any conclusions that one would like to draw\nfrom anthropic reasoning.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nRT is supported by the Royal Astronomical Society through the Sir Norman Lockyer\nFellowship.
