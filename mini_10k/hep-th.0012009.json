In [6, 7] the theory under consideration has been N = 4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills with gauge group U(N). It is the 4-dimensional gauge field theory\nwith the largest number of symmetries and as such the simplest to be studied even in its\nnoncommutative version. The analysis is simplified if one uses the superfield formulation\n[8] combined with the background field method [6]. With these techniques perturbative\ncalculations become manageable and gauge invariance is kept under control. In [6, 7] contributions to the one-loop effective action have been considered: the two- and three-point\nfunctions with external background vector fields are zero as it happens in the commutative case [9, 10, 11]. In addition the four-point function has been computed and shown\nto be in agreement with the field theory limit of corresponding string amplitudes [12].\nThe noncommutative theory is completely free of ultraviolet and infrared divergences, as\nexpected since the corresponding commutative theory is conformally invariant. In the\nbackground field method approach used in [6, 7] the perturbative calculations of background vector n-point functions are particularly simple because loops with quantum chiral\nsuperfields need not be evaluated. It is a trivial matter to show that the three ghost fields\ncompletely cancel corresponding contributions from the three chiral matter superfields.\nAfter all N = 4 super Yang-Mills has to be simple.\nAs soon as we relax the symmetry and look at the corresponding theories with N = 1\nand N = 2 supersymmetries the matter-ghost cancellation no longer occurs and more\ningenuity is required in order to proceed and compute the one-loop higher-order functions.\nAt the level of the two-point function one finds UV and IR divergences in the planar and\nin the non planar sectors respectively. This is the UV/IR mixing that signals a \u03b2 6= 0 in\nthe corresponding commutative theory.\nHere we apply the same techniques introduced in [6, 7] to the noncommutative N = 1\nand N = 2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories and consider corrections to the one-loop\neffective action up to the four-point function.\nThe noncommutative N = 1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory is described in N = 1\nsuperspace by the following classical action (with notations and conventions as in [11])\n1\nS = 2 Tr\n4g\n\n\u0012Z\n\n4\n\n2\n\n\u03b1\n\nd x d \u03b8 W W\u03b1 +\n\nZ\n\n4\n\n2\n\n\u03b1\u0307\n\nd x d \u03b8\u0304 W\u0304 W\u0304\u03b1\u0307\n\n\u0013\n\n(1)\n\u2217\n\n\u03b1 V\nwhere W \u03b1 = iD\u0304 2 (e\u2212V\n\u2217 \u2217 D e\u2217 ) is the gauge superfield strength. The fields are Lie-algebra\nvalued, e.g. V = Va T a , in the adjoint representation of U(N). In (1) the symbol |\u2217\nindicates that the superfields are multiplied using the \u2217-product defined as\ni\n\n(\u03c61 \u2217 \u03c62 )(x, \u03b8, \u03b8\u0304) \u2261 e 2 \u0398\n\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202x\u03bc \u2202y \u03bd\n\n1\n\n\u03c61 (x, \u03b8, \u03b8\u0304)\u03c62 (y, \u03b8, \u03b8\u0304)|y=x\n\n(2)\n\n\fIf, in addition to the vector real superfield V we introduce a chiral matter superfield \u03a6,\nwe can construct a theory in which N = 2 supersymmetry is realized. The corresponding\nclassical action describes N = 2 noncommutative Yang-Mills written in terms of N = 1\nsuperfields\nS=\n\n1\nTr\ng2\n\n\u0012Z\n\nd4 x d4 \u03b8 e\u2212V \u03a6\u0304eV \u03a6 +\n\n1Z 4 2\n1Z 4 2\nd x d \u03b8 W \u03b1 W\u03b1 +\nd x d \u03b8\u0304 W\u0304 \u03b1\u0307 W\u0304\u03b1\u0307\n4\n4\n\n\u0013\n\n(3)\n\u2217\n\nThe noncommutative theories in (1) and (3) can be quantized using the background\nfield method [6], essentially adopting the same procedure as in the commutative case\n[9, 13].\nFor the gauge multiplet one performs a non linear splitting between the quantum\nprepotential V and the background superfield, via covariant derivatives (in quantum chiral\nrepresentation [11])\nV\n\u2207\u03b1 = e\u2212V\n\u2217 D\u03b1 eV\u2217 \u2192 e\u2212V\n\u2217 \u2207B\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u03b1 e\u2217\n\n \u0304 \u03b1\u0307 = D\u0304\u03b1\u0307 \u2192 \u2207\n \u0304B\n\u2207\n\u03b1\u0307\n\n(4)\n\nIn this way the external background enters in the quantum action implicitly in the background covariant derivatives through the connections\n \u0304 B = D\u0304\u03b1\u0307 \u2212 i\u0393\u0304\u03b1\u0307\n\u2207\n\u03b1\u0307\n\n\u2207B\n\u03b1 = D\u03b1 \u2212 i\u0393\u03b1\n\n\u2207B\na = \u2202a \u2212 i\u0393a\n\n(5)\n\n \u0304 B\u03b1\u0307 , {\u2207\n \u0304 B , \u2207B }].

The three ghosts c, c\u2032 and\n \u0304 \u03b1\u0307 c = \u2207\n \u0304 \u03b1\u0307 c\u2032 = \u2207\n \u0304 \u03b1\u0307 b = 0. While\nb are background covariantly chiral superfields, i.e. \u2207\nB\nB\nB\nthe Faddeev-Popov ghosts do have interactions with the quantum V fields, the NielsenKallosh ghost interacts only with the background. Therefore it contributes only at one\nloop. In the following we drop the suffix B from the covariant derivatives since covariance\nis everywhere with respect to the background and no ambiguity can arise.\n2\n\n\fAfter gauge-fixing the quadratic quantum V -action becomes\nS\u2192\u2212\n\n1\nTr\n4g 2\n\nZ\n\n \u0304 \u03b1\u0307 ) \u2217 V\nd4 x d4 \u03b8 V \u2217 (\u2737 \u2212 iW\u03b1 \u2217 \u2207\u03b1 \u2212 iW\u0304\u03b1\u0307 \u2217 \u2207\n\n(9)\n\nwhere \u2737 \u2261 1/2\u2207a \u2207a is the background covariant Laplacian.\nFor the matter superfield \u03a6 which appear in (3) the quantum-background splitting is\na standard linear one\n\u03a6 \u2192 \u03a6 + \u03a6B\n(10)\nwhere \u03a6B is the background external field. The superfields \u03a6 and \u03a6B are background\n \u0304 \u03b1\u0307 \u03a6 = 0.\ncovariantly chiral \u2207\nOur final goal is to compute one-loop contributions to the effective actions of N = 1\nand N = 2 Yang-Mills with external vector background fields. Therefore the corresponding actions quadratic in the quantum fields are all we need for these one-loop calculations.\nFrom (9) we see that the interactions with the background are at most linear in the Dspinor derivatives. Since at least two D's and two D\u0304's are needed in the loop in order to\ncomplete the D-algebra, from (9) one starts obtaining a nonvanishing result at the level\nof the four-point function. We conclude that for the N = 1 theory the contributions to\nthe vector two- and three-point functions can be generated only by ghosts circulating in\nthe loop. For the N = 2 theory we have to take into account also the contributions from\nthe chiral matter loop.\nAs mentioned above the three ghosts are background covariant chiral superfields with\nactions given in (7) and (8) respectively. Since we only compute up to one loop, in\n(7) we can drop terms that contain interactions with the quantum V -field. The same\nconsiderations apply also to the chiral superfield \u03a6 in (3). In fact in our calculations\nwe do not consider diagrams with external matter. Therefore in (3) we keep only the\nquantum \u03a6's and drop their interactions with the quantum V 's that would never enter in\na one-loop diagram.\nFor the N = 1 theory we end up with the sum of three identical ghost loops. Each ghost\ncontributes to the one-loop effective action exactly as a standard background covariant\nchiral superfield would do, the only difference being an overall opposite sign because of\nthe statistics. For the N = 2 theory we obtain contributions from covariantly chiral loops\nwith a factor (\u22123) from the ghosts and a factor (+1) from the chiral matter. Thus we\nexplain the general procedure for the computation of a chiral one-loop contribution. We\nuse a formulation of the background covariant field method which is particularly simple\nand it is valid for real representations of the gauge group as it is the case of interest to\nus, i.e. the adjoint representation. We do not consider matter in complex representations\nwhich are in general affected by anomalies [14].\nThe rules of background covariant perturbation theory for commutative supersymmetric\nYang-Mills are clearly explained in ref. [11] sect. 6.5. First we summarize here the part\nwhich is relevant for our specific calculation. Then we introduce the modifications needed\nin the noncommutative case.\n3\n\n\fIn order to obtain the Feynman rules for a general background covariantly chiral\nsuperfield \u03a6 with action Sm one starts from the generating functional\n \u0304 =\nZ(J, J)\n\nZ\n\n\u0014\n\nZ\n\n4\n\n2\n\nD\u03a6 D \u03a6\u0304 exp Sm + ( d x d \u03b8 J\u03a6 + h.c.)\n\n\u0015\n\n(11)\n\n \u0304 \u03b1\u0307 \u03a6 = \u2207\n \u0304 \u03b1\u0307 J = 0. The one-loop contribution\nwhere both \u03a6 and J are covariantly chiral \u2207\nto the effective action from the \u03a6 superfield is given by the Gaussian integral over the\nquantum matter fields\n\u2206=\n\nZ\n\nD\u03a6 D \u03a6\u0304 exp\n\n\u0014Z\n\n\u0015\n\nd4 x d4 \u03b8 \u03a6\u0304\u03a6\n\n(12)\n\nThe covariant generalization of the standard method leads to the introduction of chiral\nd'Alembertians \u2737\u00b1 defined as\n \u0304 2 \u22072 \u03a6 = \u2737+ \u03a6\n\u2207\n\n \u0304 2 \u03a6\u0304 = \u2737\u2212 \u03a6\u0304\n\u22072 \u2207\n\n(13)\n\nwith\ni\n\u2737+ = \u2737 \u2212 (\u2207\u03b1 W\u03b1 ) \u2212 iW\u03b1 \u2207\u03b1\n2\ni  \u0304 \u03b1\u0307\n \u0304 \u03b1\u0307\nW\u0304\u03b1\u0307 ) \u2212 iW\u0304\u03b1\u0307 \u2207\n\u2737\u2212 = \u2737 \u2212 (\u2207\n2\n\n(14)\n\nIn this way one finds [11] that\n\u2206 = exp\n\n\"Z\n\n1 \u03b4  \u03042 2\n\u03b4\ndxd\u03b8\n[\u2207 \u2207 \u2212 D\u0304 2 D 2 ]\n2 \u03b4J\n\u03b4J\n4\n\n2\n\n#\n\n\u0014\n\n* exp \u2212\n\nZ\n\n1\nd x d \u03b8 J\u2737\u22121\nJ\n2 0\n4\n\n2\n\n\u0015\n\n(15)\n\nwhere \u27370 = 1/2\u2202 a \u2202a is the free d'Alembertian. A one-loop graph consists in a string of\n \u0304 2 \u22072 \u2212 D\u0304 2 D 2 ], a standard scalar propagator\nvertices and propagators, i.e. a vertex like [\u2207\n\u22121\n(\u2212\u27370 ), a vertex again and so on. The calculation is more conveniently performed using\n \u0304 \u03b1\u0307 = D\u0304\u03b1\u0307 . Indeed this allows to simplify all the\nthe background chiral representation, \u2207\nvertices but one, making repeated use of the identity\n \u0304 2 \u22072 \u2212 D\u0304 2 D 2 ]D\u0304 2 = [\u2737+ \u2212 \u27370 ]D\u0304 2\n[\u2207\n\n(16)\n\nThe net result is that one has to compute one-loop diagrams constructed with the following\npropagators and vertices\n1\n\u27370\n\npropagators :\n\n\u2212\n\nall vertices :\n\n\u2737+ \u2212 \u27370\n\nbut one :\n\nD\u0304 2 (\u22072 \u2212 D 2 )\n\n(17)\n\nFor a given graph, i.e. for a fixed number of vertices, the completion of the Dalgebra is very simple: only one vertex contains D\u0304's and the two are both needed in\n4\n\n\f\u03b4 4 (\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8\u2032 )D\u0304 2 D 2 \u03b4 4 (\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8\u2032 ) = \u03b4 4 (\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8\u2032 ). Taking advantage of this covariant technique, the\nevaluation of the one-loop contributions from chiral superfields has been reduced to a\nrather trivial exercise.\nNow we turn to the noncommutative theory and evaluate explicitly the two- and the\nthree-point function contributions.\nThe extension of the above procedure to noncommutative super Yang-Mills is straightforward [6, 7]. One simply has to take into proper account the \u2217-multiplication which\nreplaces the standard product in the formulas above. This amounts to the introduction of\nexponential factors in the vertices, while the propagators remain unchanged. In particular\nat the vertices one has to keep track of the order in which the quantum fields are Wick\ncontracted, a different order giving rise to a different exponential factor and ultimately\nto a planar or a non planar diagram. In complete generality a vertex quadratic in the\nquantum fields can be written symbolically in momentum space as\nU(k1 , k2 , k3 ) = Tr (Q(k1 ) \u2217 B(k2 ) \u2217 Q(k3 ))\ni\n\n= Tr(T a T b T c ) e\u2212 2 (k1 \u00d7k2 +k2 \u00d7k3 +k1 \u00d7k3 ) Qa (k1 )Bb (k2 )Qc (k3 )\n\n(18)\n\nwhere Q and B denote the quantum and the background superfields respectively. The\nmomenta are flowing into the vertex, k1 + k2 + k3 = 0, and we have used the definition\nki \u00d7 kj \u2261 (ki )\u03bc \u0398\u03bc\u03bd (kj )\u03bd for the \u2217-product. Depending on the order in which the quantum\nQ-fields are Wick contracted when inserted in the loop, from each vertex one obtains two\ntypes of terms, an untwisted P -term and a twisted T -term [6, 7]\ni\n\ni\n\nP \u2192 Tr(T a T b T c ) e\u2212 2 (k1 \u00d7k2 +k2 \u00d7k3 +k1 \u00d7k3 ) = Tr(T a T b T c ) e\u2212 2 k2 \u00d7k3\ni\n\ni\n\nT \u2192 \u00b1Tr(T c T b T a ) e 2 (k1 \u00d7k2 +k2 \u00d7k3 +k1 \u00d7k3 ) = \u00b1Tr(T c T b T a ) e 2 k2 \u00d7k3\n\n(19)\n\nThe +, \u2212 sign in the T -term takes into account the bosonic, respectively fermionic, nature\nof the background external field.\nWith all of this in mind, we proceed with the following strategy: for each diagram\nthe calculation is performed in momentum space, and first we complete the D-algebra in\nthe loop, second we introduce the exponential factors from the \u2217-products at the vertices\nand make a distinction between planar and non planar contributions, finally we evaluate\nthe momentum integral. In order to accomplish the first step we rewrite the vertices in\n(17) with flat derivatives and explicit dependence on the background (the \u2217-multiplication\nbetween superfields is always understood)\n\u2737+ \u2212 \u27370 \u2192 \u2206+ \u2212 iW\u03b1 D\u03b1\n\n1\nD\u0304 2 (\u22072 \u2212 D 2 ) \u2192 \u2212i\u0393\u03b1 D\u0304 2 D\u03b1 \u2212 [i(D \u03b1 \u0393\u03b1 ) + \u0393\u03b1 \u0393\u03b1 ]D\u0304 2\n2\n5\n\n(20)\n\n\fwhere we have defined\n1\ni\ni\n\u2206+ \u2261 \u2212i\u0393a \u2202a \u2212 (\u2202 a \u0393a ) \u2212 \u0393a \u0393a \u2212 (D \u03b1 W\u03b1 ) \u2212 iW\u03b1 \u0393\u03b1\n2\n2\n2\n\n(21)\n\nNow we go back to (15) and start expanding the exponentials in order to compute the\nvarious contributions to the one-loop effective action:\n1\n)\n\u27370\n\n(1) :\n\nD\u0304 2 (\u22072 \u2212 D 2 )(\u2212\n\n(2) :\n\n(\u2737+ \u2212 \u27370 )(\u2212\n\n1\n1\n)D\u0304 2 (\u22072 \u2212 D 2 )(\u2212 )\n\u27370\n\u27370\n\n(3) :\n\n(\u2737+ \u2212 \u27370 )(\u2212\n\n1\n1\n1\n)(\u2737+ \u2212 \u27370 )(\u2212 )D\u0304 2 (\u22072 \u2212 D 2 )(\u2212 )\n\u27370\n\u27370\n\u27370\n\n(4) :\n\n(\u2737+ \u2212 \u27370 )(\u2212\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\n)(\u2737+ \u2212 \u27370 )(\u2212 )(\u2737+ \u2212 \u27370 )(\u2212 )D\u0304 2 (\u22072 \u2212 D 2 )(\u2212 )\n\u27370\n\u27370\n\u27370\n\u27370\n\n.........\n\n(22)\n\nSince at least two D's and two D\u0304's are needed for a nonzero result, from (20) we immediately obtain that the first order expansion does not contribute. Moreover since the vertex\n(\u2737+ \u2212 \u27370 ) contains at most one D that can be used for the D-algebra, the second order\nexpansion only contributes to the two-point function\n(\u2737+ \u2212 \u27370 )(\u2212\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\n)D\u0304 2 (\u22072 \u2212 D 2 )(\u2212 ) \u2192 \u2212iW\u03b1 D\u03b1 (\u2212 )(\u2212i\u0393\u03b2 D\u0304 2 D\u03b2 )(\u2212 )\n\u27370\n\u27370\n\u27370\n\u27370\n\u2192 W\u03b1 (\u2212\n\n1\n1\n)\u0393\u03b1 (\u2212 )\n\u27370\n\u27370\n\n(23)\n\nAccording to the general strategy, having completed the D-algebra we have to take into\naccount the nature of the quantum background vertices we started with. Going back to\n(19), we learn that the combination P P + T T corresponds to the planar graphs, while\nP T + T P gives rise to the non planar ones. Thus we obtain the following contributions\nto the one-loop two-point function:\n(2)\n\u0393planar\n\n= N\n\nZ\n\nd2 \u03b8\n\nd4 p\nTr (W\u03b1 (p)W\u03b1 (\u2212p))\n(2\u03c0)4\nZ\n1\nd4 k\n4\n2\n2\n(2\u03c0) (k + m )[(p + k)2 + m2 ]\n\n(24)\n\nand\n(2)\n\n\u0393nonplanar = \u2212\n\nZ\n\nd2 \u03b8\n\nd4 p\nTr (W\u03b1 (p)) Tr (W\u03b1 (\u2212p))\n(2\u03c0)4\nZ\nd4 k\neip\u00d7k\n(2\u03c0)4 (k 2 + m2 )[(p + k)2 + m2 ]\n6\n\n(25)\n\n\fwhere m is an IR mass regulator. The result in (24) reproduces the logarithmic UV\ndivergence that leads to a nonvanishing one-loop \u03b2-function both for the N = 1 and\nthe N = 2 theories, with the counting that we already mentioned, i.e. (\u22123) times the\ncontribution in (24) from the three ghosts in the N = 1 case, (\u22123 + 1) from the three\nghosts and one chiral matter for the N = 2 case.\nThe corresponding nonplanar result in (25) is finite in the UV thanks to the presence\nof the non local scale \u2206x\u03bc = \u0398\u03bc\u03bd p\u03bd that acts as a short distance cutoff. In the low-energy\napproximation, pi * pj small, with pi \u00d7 pj finite it is easy to perform the k-integration.\nWith the definition p \u25e6 p = p\u03bc \u0398\u03bc\u03bd \u0398\u03c1\u03bd p\u03c1 , one obtains\n(2)l.e.\n\n\u0393nonplanar = \u2212\n\n1\n8\u03c0 2\n\nZ\n\nd2 \u03b8\n\nd4 p\n\u221a\nTr (W\u03b1 (p)) Tr (W\u03b1 (\u2212p)) K0 (m p \u25e6 p)\n4\n(2\u03c0)\n\n(26)\n\nSince\n\nz\n(27)\n2\nthe expression in (26) is divergent in the IR [5]. In a sense the real novelty of noncommutative theories is given by the interplay between the UV and the IR behaviour. The lack\nof conformal invariance of the quantum commutative theory (\u03b2 6= 0) leads to a nonperturbative, singular behaviour in the non local scale (\u0398 6= 0). A complete understanding\nof the role played by this effect is likely to be found from string dynamics [15].\nNow we continue in our task and turn to the computation of the vector three-point\nfunction due to a chiral matter loop.\nlim K0 (z) = \u2212 ln\n\nz\u21920\n\nAs observed before, the second order expansion in (22) contributes only to the two-point\nfunction. Thus the three-point function is obtained from the third order terms\n(\u2737+ \u2212 \u27370 )(\u2212\n\n1\n1\n1\n)(\u2737+ \u2212 \u27370 )(\u2212 )D\u0304 2 (\u22072 \u2212 D 2 )(\u2212 )\n\u27370\n\u27370\n\u27370\n\n(28)\n\nwhere at every vertex we only keep terms which are linear in the background fields.\nInserting (20) and (21) in (28) we obtain several contributions, all with trivial D-algebra,\nthat we list:\n(a) :\n\n\u2212\u2192\n(b) :\n\n1\n1\ni\n1\n) (\u2212iW\u03b2 D\u03b2 ) (\u2212 ) D\u0304 2 (\u2212 D \u03b1 \u0393\u03b1 ) (\u2212 )\n\u27370\n\u27370\n2\n\u27370\n1\ni\n1\n1\nW\u03b2 (\u2212 ) W\u03b2 (\u2212 ) (\u2212 D \u03b1 \u0393\u03b1 ) (\u2212 )\n\u27370\n\u27370\n2\n\u27370\n\n(\u2212iW\u03b3 D\u03b3 ) (\u2212\n\n1\n1\n1\n) (\u2212iW\u03b2 D\u03b2 ) (\u2212 ) (\u2212i\u0393\u03b1 D\u0304 2 D\u03b1 ) (\u2212 )\n\u27370\n\u27370\n\u27370\n1\n1\n1\n\u2212\u2192 (\u2212W\u03b3 ) (\u2212 ) (D\u03b3 W\u03b2 ) (\u2212 ) (i\u0393\u03b2 ) (\u2212 )\n\u27370\n\u27370\n\u27370\n1\n1\n1\n+ W\u03b2 (\u2212 ) W\u03b2 (\u2212 ) (iD \u03b1 \u0393\u03b1 ) (\u2212 )\n\u27370\n\u27370\n\u27370\n\n(\u2212iW\u03b3 D\u03b3 ) (\u2212\n\n7\n\n\f(c) :\n\n(d) :\n\ni\ni\n1\n1\n1\n[\u2212i\u0393a \u2202a \u2212 (\u2202 a \u0393a ) \u2212 D \u03b1 W\u03b1 ] (\u2212 ) (\u2212iW\u03b2 D\u03b2 ) (\u2212 ) (\u2212i\u0393\u03b3 D\u0304 2 D\u03b3 ) (\u2212 )\n2\n2\n\u27370\n\u27370\n\u27370\ni\n1\n1\n1\ni\n\u2212\u2192 [\u2212i\u0393a \u2202a \u2212 (\u2202 a \u0393a ) \u2212 D \u03b1 W\u03b1 ] (\u2212 ) W\u03b2 (\u2212 ) \u0393\u03b2 (\u2212 )\n2\n2\n\u27370\n\u27370\n\u27370\n1\ni\ni\n1\n1\n) [\u2212i\u0393a \u2202a \u2212 (\u2202 a \u0393a ) \u2212 D \u03b1 W\u03b1 ] (\u2212 ) (\u2212i\u0393\u03b3 D\u0304 2 D\u03b3 ) (\u2212 )\n\u27370\n2\n2\n\u27370\n\u27370\ni\n1\ni\n1\n1\nW\u03b2 (\u2212 ) [\u2212i\u0393a \u2202a \u2212 (\u2202 a \u0393a ) \u2212 D \u03b1 W\u03b1 ] (\u2212 ) \u0393\u03b2 (\u2212 )\n\u27370\n2\n2\n\u27370\n\u27370\n(29)\n\n(\u2212iW\u03b2 D\u03b2 ) (\u2212\n\u2212\u2192\n\nHaving completed the D-algebra now we have to take into account the \u2217-products and\nthe orderings from Wick contractions at the vertices. We have external momenta p1 , p2 ,\np3 with p1 + p2 + p3 = 0 and a momentum k in the loop. Planar diagrams correspond\nto arrangements of the vertices like P1 P2 P3 and T1 T2 T3 , while non planar diagrams correspond to the six terms P1 P2 T3 , P1 T2 P3 , T1 P2 P3 , T1 T2 P3 , T1 P2 T3 , P1 T2 T3 . In order to\nwrite the final result in a simple form it is convenient to arrange the external background\nfields in the most symmetric way, i.e. for every term we write\nAa (p1 ) Bb (p2 ) Cc (p3 ) + all permutations (p1 a) \u2194 (p2 b) \u2194 (p3 c)\n\n(30)\n\nNow we are ready to analyze the contributions in (29). We can use the symmetry property\nin (30) and exchange the external fields (keeping track of the correct sign when fermionic\nfields are involved). Also we can integrate by parts derivatives in order to reduce the various terms to similar structures. In this way one finds immediately that the contributions\ncontaining the connection \u0393a cancel. In fact making use of the relation\n1\n1\nD\u03b1 W\u03b2 = D(\u03b1 W\u03b2) + C\u03b2\u03b1 D \u03b3 W\u03b3\n2\n2\n\n(31)\n\nit is easy to show that also the remaining terms add up to zero. Thus the chiral matter\ncontribution to the vector three-point function is zero. This result, combined with the\nfact that vectors circulating in the loop do not contribute (not enough D's in the loop),\nleads to the conclusion that the one-loop three-point function with vector external lines\nis zero for N = 1, N = 2 and N = 4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills. The simplicity of the\nabove calculation is a good example of the power of the background covariant superfield\napproach as compared to standard superfield techniques (cf. [16]) or to component field\nmethods.\nFinally we consider the chiral loop corrections to the effective action with four vector external fields. Here we explain the general procedure while the details and the presentation\nof the complete answer will be given elsewhere [17].\nOne obtains contributions from the third order expansion in (22) with one of the\nvertices quadratic in the background, and contributions from the fourth order expansion\n8\n\n\fwith all the vertices linear in the background. It is straightforward to list the various\nterms and perform the D-algebra, exactly as we have done in the previous two examples.\nOnce again one can exploit the symmetries of the four-point function, i.e. for every term\nwe write\nAa (p1 ) Bb (p2 ) Cc (p3 ) Dd (p4 ) + all permutations (p1 a) \u2194 (p2 b) \u2194 (p3 c) \u2194 (p4 d)\n(32)\nIn this way the result is drastically simplified and one can isolate the terms which, at the\ncomponent level, give rise to structures with four external F\u03bc\u03bd field strengths. To this end\none has to remember that the bosonic field strength F\u03bc\u03bd is contained in the superfield [11]\n\u03bc\u03bd\nD(\u03b1 W\u03b2) \u2192 f\u03b1\u03b2 = \u03c3\u03b1\u03b2\nF\u03bc\u03bd\n\n(33)\n\nwhere (\u03c3\u03bc\u03bd )\u03b1\u03b2 \u2261 \u22121/4(\u03c3\u03bc \u03c3\u0303\u03bd \u2212 \u03c3\u03bd \u03c3\u0303\u03bc )\u03b1\u03b2 and (\u03c3\u03bc )\u03b1\u03b1\u0307 \u2261 (1, ~\u03c3), (\u03c3\u0303\u03bd )\u03b1\u0307\u03b1 \u2261 (1, \u2212~\u03c3 ). Back to the\nfour-point function, one finds relevant contributions in the form\nW\u03b3 (\u2212\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\n) (D \u03b2 W\u03b3 ) (\u2212 ) (D\u03b2 W\u03b1) (\u2212 ) \u0393\u03b1 (\u2212 )\n\u27370\n\u27370\n\u27370\n\u27370\n\n(34)\n\nThe external fields, completely symmetrized, are arranged as follows\nR(1a, 2b, 3c, 4d) \u2261 Wa\u03b3 (p1 )(D \u03b2 Wb\u03b3 )(p2 )(D\u03b2 Wc\u03b1 )(p3 )\u0393d\u03b1 (p4 ) +\n+ all permutations (p1 a) \u2194 (p2 b) \u2194 (p3 c) \u2194 (p4 d)\n\n(35)\n\nso that the above expression can be compared directly with the bosonic component amplitude since\nZ\n\nd4 \u03b8 R(1a, 2b, 3c, 4d) \u2192 t\u03bc1 \u03bd1 \u03bc2 \u03bd2 \u03bc3 \u03bd3 \u03bc4 \u03bd4 F\u03bca1 \u03bd1 (p1 )F\u03bcb2 \u03bd2 (p2 )F\u03bcc3 \u03bd3 (p3 )F\u03bcd4 \u03bd4 (p4 )\n\n(36)\n\nwhere t\u03bc1 \u03bd1 \u03bc2 \u03bd2 \u03bc3 \u03bd3 \u03bc4 \u03bd4 is the symmetric tensor given e.g. in (9.A.18) of [18].\nIn addition to terms like the ones in (34), one obtains also terms in the form\nW\u03b1 (\u2212\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\n) W\u03b1 (\u2212 ) W\u0304\u03b1\u0307 (\u2212 ) W\u0304\u03b1\u0307 (\u2212 )\n\u27370\n\u27370\n\u27370\n\u27370\n\n(37)\n\nwhich are generated by the appearance of structures like i\u2202a \u0393\u03b1 \u2212 iD \u03b1 \u0393a = 2W\u0304\u03b1\u0307 . Using\nthe relation\nZ\n\nd4 \u03b8\n\nh\n\nW\u03b1a (p1 )W\u03b1b (p2 )W\u0304\u03b1\u0307c (p3 )W\u0304\u03b1\u0307d (p4 )\n+ all permutations (p1 a) \u2194 (p2 b) \u2194 (p3 c) \u2194 (p4 d)]\n\n\u2192 t\u03bc1 \u03bd1 \u03bc2 \u03bd2 \u03bc3 \u03bd3 \u03bc4 \u03bd4 F\u03bca1 \u03bd1 (p1 )F\u03bcb2 \u03bd2 (p2 )F\u03bcc3 \u03bd3 (p3 )F\u03bcd4 \u03bd4 (p4 )\n9\n\n(38)\n\n\ffrom the superfield result in (37) once again one can extract the bosonic contributions.\nThen in all the various terms one has to insert the appropriate \u2217-products that give\nrise to planar and non planar diagrams, exactly as it has been done in [6, 7]. At that\nstage one evaluates the loop momentum integrals with four propagators\nI0 (k; p1 , . . . , p4 ) =\n\n[(k + p1\n\n)2\n\n+\n\nm2 ][k 2\n\n+\n\nm2 ][(k\n\n1\n(39)\n\u2212 p4 )2 + m2 ][(k + p1 + p2 )2 + m2 ]\n\nfor each diagram.\nOnce all the terms have been collected, again as we have argued for the two-point\nfunction, we have to multiply the final answer by (\u22123) from the three chiral ghosts in\nthe case of the N = 1 theory , while for N = 2 we have the same contribution times the\nfactor (\u22123 + 1) which counts the three ghosts and one chiral superfield. The complete\nfour-point function with vector external fields [17] is then obtained by adding to the oneloop matter corrections the corresponding one-loop vector corrections computed in [7].\nIt would be interesting to evaluate the corresponding amplitudes in the appropriate D3brane configurations and compare the field theory limit from the string approach to the\none-loop field theory effective action calculations.\nA neat result that we have obtained is the vanishing of the vector three-point function\nin all N = 1, 2, 4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories. Since we have used the background\nfield quantization this result is a gauge invariant statement. It is in correspondence with\nthe fact that in the supersymmetric Born-Infeld action terms cubic in the F\u03bc\u03bd field strength\nare absent.\nThe superfield background covariant method provides a very efficient mean of computing in perturbation theory. One could take advantage of this and study renormalization\nproperties of correlators of gauge invariant operators in noncommutative field theories\n[19, 20].\n\nAcknowledgements\nI thank Marc Grisaru and Carlos Nunez for interesting conversations and the Department\nof Harvard University for warm hospitality while this work has been performed.
