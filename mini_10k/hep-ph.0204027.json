The approximately conserved\nquantum numbers \u2013 which are really assumed to be gauged, although that may not be\nso crucial \u2013 are supposed to be broken by various Higgs fields. We could get a good fit\nof all the masses and mixing angles. However, this previous version of our model fails\nby providing too little baryogenesis to be produced in the early Big Bang. To calculate\nthe baryogenesis we use the Fukugita-Yanagida scheme for producing a B \u2212 L excess at\nthe time when the temperature of the Universe passes the scale of the see-saw neutrino\nmasses; in fact the see-saw mechanism for neutrinos masses is incorporated into our model\nin as far as we have three right-handed neutrinos having Majorana masses acquired via a\ncertain Higgs vacuum expectation value (VEV), h\u03c6B\u2212L i.\nIn such model(s) we can play around with the system of charges, but most importantly\nwe have played with developing the charge assignments of the Higgs fields breaking the\n(gauge) group so that these charges are only approximately conserved. It is the detailed\nquantum numbers of the speculated Higgses that we used to develop to fit more and\nmore experimental informations. In the last improvement we got the model to predict\nLarge Mixing Angle-MSW [2] (LMA-MSW) solution rather than Small Mixing AngleMSW (SMA-MSW) solution by replacing the two of our Higgs fields which are able to\ncause transitions between first and second generation quarks and leptons by a new pair\nwhich actually turned out to have more elegant quantum numbers.\nAs we are now fitting all the masses and mixing angles, the constraints on our model\nare so tight that we hardly can change it anymore. However, we shall see below \u2013 and\nthat is the main point of the present article \u2013 that we could still change the quantum\nnumbers of the Higgs field delivering the over all scale of the see-saw neutrino masses.\nThe difficulty of getting enough baryons with our type of model hangs together with\nthat even the largest element in the (Dirac) neutrino matrix is suppressed compared to\nunity by a factor 10\u22122 . Only our up-type quark and right-handed neutrino mass matrix\nhave order of unity elements. Models with two Weinberg-Salam Higgs doublets can on\nthe contrary have a tan \u03b2 that is large and give suppressions to the down-type quark\nand charged lepton masses so that the Yukawa couplings for these (lepton and down-type\nquark) particles could be as large as of order unity. That is to say two Higgs doublet\nmodels may in general tend to get stronger Yukawa couplings and thereby easier CP\nviolation since the latter comes only in one-loop accuracy.\nIt means that we are in need for possible enhancements for baryogenesis. The possibility for that which it actually turns out that we can obtain very elegantly in our model\nis to make the mass difference between some of the see-saw neutrinos smaller than in the\nprevious model. In fact the CP violating asymmetry parameter is essentially inversely\nproportional to the mass difference between the see-saw neutrino producing the asymme2\n\n\ftry in its decay and another see-saw neutrino. Due to the self-energy contribution almost\ndegenerate neutrinos can even enhance the asymmetry by orders of magnitude compared\nto what it would be with the right-handed neutrino mass ratios of order unity. It would\ntherefore be a progress in the direction of producing enough baryons to put two of our\nsee-saw neutrinos almost degenerate in mass. It is very natural to obtain this situation\nby letting an off-diagonal element in the see-saw neutrino mass matrix dominate. That\nmay be done by adjusting the quantum numbers of that Higgs field \u03c6B\u2212L which gives the\nmasses and the mass scale of the see-saw neutrinos so that it causes the transition from\none flavour to another.\nThis article is organised as follows: in the next section, we present general assumptions\nfor the model building, and we review our model \u2013 the family replicated gauge group\nmodel. In section 3 we define our notation for the fermion mass terms in the Lagrangian\nand their mixing angles. Then, in section 4 the renormalisation group equations of all\nsectors are presented. The calculation is described in section 5 and the results for the\nfermion masses and mixing angles are presented in section 6. In section 7 we discuss the\nFukugita-Yanagida scheme of baryon number production, and in section 8 the wash-out\nof the produced B \u2212 L excess is approximated and our results of the calculation are given\nin section 9. A discussion on the proton decay goes into section 10. Finally, section 11\ncontains our conclusions.\n\n2\n\nModel with many mass protecting charges\n\n2.1\n\nGeneral feature\n\nThe main point of the model we use here is that the \"small hierarchies\" of the quark\nand lepton masses are due to approximately conserved quantum numbers [3] preventing\nthe masses from being different from zero, i.e., that the Yukawa couplings which are\nin Standard Model mysteriously small should really be understood as being so due to\nthat they need breaking of some charge conservations. In fact we consider these Yukawa\ncouplings just some effective couplings representing at the fundamental level more complicated vertex diagrams involving attachments to the VEVs of Higgs fields breaking the\ncharge conservations in question (see Fig. 1).\nWe summarise here our philosophy to build a model that can predict, rather say fits\nby it having the all fermion quantities including not only the neutrino oscillations but\nalso baryogenesis in following ingredients:\n\u2022 All fundamental coupling constants and masses are of order unity.\nAll gauge and Yukawa couplings are of order one at the Planck scale, in fact, we\ntake the fundamental scale as the Planck one. From this point of view we treat\nthem as random numbers, and partly to be able to \"explain\" CP violation\nwe assume that all Yukawa couplings are also complex random numbers. Also\n3\n\n\fthe masses of particles should be of order Planck scale unless they are mass\nprotected, so as to have masses determined by the VEVs of Higgs fields say.\n\u2022 Only VEVs are allowed far from order one.\nThus also the scalar field masses corresponding to the VEVs are allowed to\nbe very small, since otherwise it would be inconsistent to have MH2 = \u03bb h\u03c6W S i\nunless \u03bb has huge value.\nThis assumption could gain supports from\n(a) the well-known weak scale being extremely small compare to the Planck scale.\n(b) dynamical symmetry e.g. Nambu-Jona-Lasinio [4] can lead to equation for the\nlogarithm of the VEV scale.\n(c) in superconductivity VEVs tend very small compared to the atomic dimensionality argument.\n\u2022 There are a priori several conserved charges and the various Weyl components of\nquarks and leptons have usually different charges, i.e., quantum numbers.\nSince we let Weyl components of different families have in general different\nquantum numbers of these kinds, they are to be considered horizontal, but\nthey should better not bring together into multiplets different families because\nthat would make the remarkably large inter-family mass ratios difficult to incorporate (unless the group is strongly broken).\n\n\u0001\n\n\u2022 Incorporate the see-saw mechanism [5].\n\nA new scale must be introduced into the model. In our case we assume a new\nscale about 1010 GeV. This scale becomes crudely the masses of right-handed\n(Majorana) neutrinos, and therefore B \u2212 L quantum charge being broken at\nthat energy scale.\nhT i\n\nlL\n\nlR\n\nhW i\nh\u03c9i\n\n\u03c6W S\n\nFigure 1: Diagram giving the effective Standard Model Dirac Yukawa coupling. Here\nWeinberg-Salam Higgs field is denoted as \u03c6W S .\n\n4\n\n\fNote that we do not assume the existence of Supersymmetry or Grand Unification. However, our prediction came out that SU(5) mass relations are order of magnitudewise valid\ndue to the diagonal elements of different mass matrices need same quantum numbers\nbeing broken in our specific model.\n\n2.2\n\nOur specific model of many conserved charges\n\nWe have already investigated a model [1, 6] which can predict all quark and charged\nlepton quantities including baryogenesis1 . This model is of the type described in the\nforegoing subsection with the further good restriction that the quantum numbers for the\nWeyl particles are so chosen that they obey the anomaly cancelation conditions required\nfor them to be imagined gauged charges. It is namely easily seen that our gauge group\nhas no anomalies \u2013 neither gauge nor mixed ones \u2013 because it has the Standard Model\ngroup plus a B \u2212 L separately for each family. In fact our model has the specific group\n\u00d7 (SMG \u00d7 U(1)\ni\nB\u2212L,i ) ,\n\ni=1,2,3\n\n(1)\n\nwhere SMGi \u2261 SU(3)i \u00d7 SU(2)i \u00d7 U(1)i denotes the Standard Model gauge group for\neach generation (i = 1, 2, 3); \u00d7 means the Cartesian product. However, it is unlikely to be\nimportant to have this special group, provided we have sufficiently many conserved charges\nseparating in quantum number the various Weyl fields. Actually the important thing is\nthat one by means of the quantum numbers can construct some Higgs fields as we propose\nthem for the breaking of the group to the Standard Model with much the same powers\nof fields being needed in the various mass matrix elements. The latter may in fact not be\ndifficult to obtain with other groups, at least the non-abelian part of our proposed group\nis totally irrelevant for the fitting.\nWe should emphasize that due to the non-zero neutrino masses using the see-saw\npicture, it is necessary to introduce a right-handed neutrino, or preferably several \u2013 we\nhave three in our model \u2013 having Majorana masses. In our model we associate the seesaw mass scale with a gauged B \u2212 L charge. We let the latter come from the diagonal\nsubgroup of the Cartan product of a U(1)B\u2212L,i (i = 1, 2, 3) for each family.\nNote that this family replicated gauge group, eq. (1), is the maximal gauge group\nunder the following assumptions:\n(1) Considering only part of the gauge group acting non-trivially on the known 45 Weyl\nfermions of the Standard Model and the additional three heavy see-saw (righthanded) neutrinos, i.e., our gauge group is a subgroup of U(48).\n(2) Avoid gauge transformations transforming a Weyl state from one irreducible representation of the Standard Model group into another irreducible representation,\n1\n\nThe model [6] provided only the SMA-MSW solution. A main point of present article is to calculate\nbaryogenesis with LMA-MSW solution predicting mass matrices including running effects of all sectors\n(see sections 4, 7-9).\n\n5\n\n\fi.e., there is no place for the quarks and leptons occupying the same irreducible\nrepresentation under our gauge group.\n(3) No gauge nor mixed anomalies due to the renormalisability requirement.\n\n2.3\n\nDescription of quantum numbers of mass protected particles\nin model\n\nIn addition to the practically any non-mass-protected particles, which we have already\nassumed to be present with Planck scale masses, we have as is easily seen some mass\nprotected particles. The Weyl particles without chiral partners in our model are the wellknown Weyl components of the quarks and leptons in the Standard Model plus three seesaw (right-handed) heavy neutrinos, which are all easily seen to be mass protected by our\ngauge group eq.(1). These 48 Weyl particles have lower mass than the Planck scale. They\nfall into three families each consisting of the 16 Weyl particles of a usual Standard Model\ngeneration plus one see-saw particle. In this way we can label these particle as proto-lefthanded or proto-right-handed u-quark, d-quark, electron etc. To get the quantum numbers\nunder our model gauge group for a given proto-irreducible representation, we proceed in\nthe following way: We note the generation number i (i = 1, 2, 3) of the particle for which\nwe want quantum numbers and we look up, in the Standard Model, what are the quantum\nnumbers of the irreducible representation in question and what is the B \u2212 L quantum\nnumber. Then we take trivial quantum numbers for the two generations j different from\ni and put the index i to the gauge group's names, so we put the representations of the\ngroups SU(3)i , SU(2)i and U(1)i equal to the just asked quantum numbers.\nFor instance, if we want to find the quantum numbers of the proto-left-handed bottom quark, we note that the quantum numbers of the left-handed bottom quark in the\nStandard Model are weak hypercharge y/2 = 1/6, doublet under SU(2) and triplet under\nSU(3), while B \u2212 L is equal to the baryon number = 1/3. Moreover, ignoring mixing\nangles, the generation is denoted as number i = 3. The latter fact means that all the\nquantum numbers for SMGj j = 1, 2 are trivial. Also the baryon number minus lepton\nnumber for the proto-generation number one and two are zero: only the quantum numbers\nassociated with proto-generation three are non-trivial. Thus, in our model, the quantum\nnumbers of the proto-left-handed bottom quark are y3 /2 = 1/6, doublet under SU(2)3 ,\ntriplet under SU(3)3 and (B \u2212 L)3 = 1/3. For each proto-generation the following charge\nquantisation rule applies\nti di yi\n+ + = 0 (mod 1) ,\n(2)\n3\n2\n2\nwhere ti and di are the triality and duality for the i'th proto-generation gauge groups\nSU(3)i and SU(2)i respectively.\nCombining eq. (2) with the principle of taking the smallest possible representation of\nthe groups SU(3)i and SU(2)i , it is sufficient to specify the six Abelian quantum numbers\nyi /2 and (B \u2212 L)i in order to completely specify the gauge quantum numbers of the fields,\ni.e. of the Higgs fields and fermion fields. Using this rule we easily specify the fermion\n6\n\n\frepresentations as in Table 2.3. However, as already mentioned in section 2.2 these nonabelian SU(3)i and SU(2)i are really not important for our fit since they just follow the\nweak hypercharges like \"slaves\".\nNote that fermion quantum numbers for each proto-generation gauge group SMGi \u00d7\nU(1)B\u2212L,i are obtainable as considering it a subgroup of SO(10), i.e. our gauge group\neq. (1) is really a subgroup of SO(10)3. However, we avoid the not well-agreeing accurate\npredictions of simplest grand unification by not having neither SU(5)'s nor SO(10)'s: the\nmass spectra, and also proton decay.\nSMG1\nu L , dL\nuR\ndR\neL , \u03bdeL\neR\n\u03bdeR\ncL , sL\ncR\nsR\n\u03bcL , \u03bd\u03bcL\n\u03bcR\n\u03bd\u03bcR\ntL , bL\ntR\nbR\n\u03c4L , \u03bd\u03c4L\n\u03c4R\n\u03bd\u03c4R\n\u03c9\n\u03c1\nW\nT\n\u03c7\n\u03c6W S\n\u03c6B\u2212L\n\n1\n6\n2\n3\n\n\u2212 31\n\u2212 21\n\u22121\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n6\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\nSMG2\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n6\n2\n3\n\n\u2212 13\n\u2212 12\n\u22121\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\u2212 61\n0\n\u2212 21\n\u2212 16\n0\n2\n3\n\n0\n\nSMG3\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n6\n2\n3\n\n\u2212 13\n\u2212 12\n\u22121\n0\n0\n0\n1\n2\n1\n6\n\n0\n\u2212 16\n0\n\nUB\u2212L,1\n1\n3\n1\n3\n1\n3\n\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u22121\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\u2212 31\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\nUB\u2212L,2\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n3\n1\n3\n1\n3\n\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u22121\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n3\n\n\u2212 13\n0\n\u22121\n1\n3\n\n1\n\nUB\u2212L,3\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n3\n1\n3\n1\n3\n\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u22121\n0\n0\n1\n3\n\n0\n1\n\u2212 31\n1\n\nTable 1: All U(1) quantum charges for the proto-fermions and Higgs fields in the model.\n\n7\n\n\f2.4\n\nHiggses breaking the family replicated gauge group to the\nStandard Model\n\n\u00d7 (SMG \u00d7U(1)\nThe gauge group i=1,2,3\ni\nB\u2212L,i ) is at first spontaneously broken down at one or\ntwo orders of magnitude below the Planck scale, by 5 different Higgs fields, to the gauge\ngroup SMG \u00d7 U(1)B\u2212L which is the diagonal subgroup of the original one:\n\u00d7 (SMG \u00d7 U(1)\ni\nB\u2212L,i ) \u2192\n\ni=1,2,3\n\n\u0010\n\n\u00d7 (SMG \u00d7 U(1)\ni\nB\u2212L,i )\n\ni=1,2,3\n\n\u0011\n\ndiagonal\n\n\u2261 SMG \u00d7 U(1)B\u2212L .\n\n(3)\nThis diagonal subgroup is further broken down by yet two more Higgs fields - the\nWeinberg-Salam Higgs field \u03c6W S and another Higgs field \u03c6B\u2212L - to SU(3) \u00d7 U(1)em .\nThe VEV of the \u03c6B\u2212L Higgs field is taken to be about 1010 GeV and is designed to break\nthe gauged B \u2212 L quantum number. In other words the VEV, h\u03c6B\u2212L i, gives the see-saw\nscale (All U(1) quantum charged for the proto-fermions and Higgs fields are presented in\nTable 2.3.).\nWe should emphanise here that the quantum numbers of the \u03c6B\u2212L has been changed\nrelative to our previous publication due to the baryogenesis point of view. The point is\nthat baryogenesis calculated the way described below with the \"old\" quantum charge of\n\u03c6B\u2212L :\n~\u03c6\nQ\n= (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2)\n(4)\nB\u2212L\nold\n\nwould produce insufficient amount of baryon minus lepton number, whereas we shall see\nthat quantum numbers making the off-diagonal elements (2, 3) and (3, 2) of the righthanded neutrino mass matrix be the dominant ones as in Table 2.3:\n~\u03c6\nQ\n= (0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1) .\nB\u2212L\n\n3\n\n(5)\n\nFermion masses and their mixing angles\n\nIn this section we define our notations for the mass terms of the charged fermion sectors\nand the neutrino sectors. These define also the mixing angle unitary matrices for quark\nsector and neutrino sector, respectively.\n\n3.1\n\nCharged fermion masses and their mixing angles\n\nThe full Lagrangian of our model is that of a gauge theory with scalars and Weyl\nparticles of which many are the ones at the Planck scale with which we do not go into\ndetails. We shall therefore leave it to the readers imagination and only present the notation\nfor the Weinberg-Salam Yukawa part effective Lagrangian of the Standard Model form\n\u2212 Lcharged\u2212fermion\u2212mass = QL YU \u03a6\u0303W S UR + QL YD \u03a6W S DR + LL YE \u03a6W S ER + h.c.\n8\n\n(6)\n\n\fHere \u03a6W S is the Weinberg-Salam Higgs field, QL denotes the three SU(2) doublets of\nleft-handed quarks, UR denotes the three singlets of right-handed up-type quarks and\nYU is the three-by-three Yukawa coupling matrix for the up-type quarks. Similarly YD\nand YE are the Yukawa coupling matrices for the down-type quarks and charged leptons\nrespectively. The SU(2) doublets \u03a6W S and QL can be represented as 2 component column\nvectors and we then define:\n!\n0 1\n\u03a6\u0303W S =\n\u03a6\u2020W S\n(7)\n1 0\nand\nUL\nDL\n\nQL =\n\n!\n\n= (UL DL ) ,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere UL are the CP conjugates of the three left-handed up-type quarks.\nThe effective Yukawa couplings YE , for example, are obtained from identifying the\nlowest order vertex in eq. (6) with a vertex Fig. 1.\nAfter electroweak symmetry breaking the Weinberg-Salam Higgs field gets a VEV and\nwe obtain the following mass terms in the Lagrangian:\n\u2212 Lcharged\u2212fermion\u2212mass = UL MU UR + DL MD DR + EL ME ER + h.c.\n\n(9)\n\nwhere the mass matrices are related to the Yukawa coupling matrices and Weinberg-Salam\nHiggs VEV by:\nh\u03c6W S i\nM =Y \u221a\n.\n(10)\n2\nWe have chosen the normalisation from the Fermi coupling constant:\nh\u03c6W S i = 246 GeV .\n\n(11)\n\nIn order to obtain the masses from the mass matrices, MU , MD and ME , we must diagonalise them to find their eigenvalues. In particular we can find unitary matrices, VU for\nthe up-type quarks, VD for the down-type quarks and VE for the charged leptons:\n\u0010\n\nVU\u2020 MU MU\u2020 VU = diag m2u , m2c , m2t\n\u0010\n\nVD\u2020 MD MD\u2020 VD = diag m2d , m2s , m2b\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0011\n\nVE\u2020 ME ME\u2020 VE = diag m2e , m2\u03bc , m2\u03c4\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n(12)\n\n,\n\n(13)\n\n.\n\n(14)\n\nThe quark mixing matrix is then defined with these unitary matrices as [7]:\nVCKM = VU\u2020 VD .\n\n(15)\n\nThis VCKM unitary matrix is parameterised as follows:\nVCKM\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\nc12 c13\ns12 c13\ns13 e\u2212i\u03b413\n\uf8ec\ns23 c13 \uf8f7\n= \uf8ed \u2212s12 c23 \u2212 c12 s23 s13 ei\u03b413 c12 c23 \u2212 s12 s23 s13 ei\u03b413\n\uf8f8\ni\u03b413\ni\u03b413\ns12 s23 \u2212 c12 c23 s13 e\n\u2212c12 s23 \u2212 s12 c23 s13 e\nc23 c13\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\nVud Vus Vub\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n= \uf8ed Vcd Vcs Vcb \uf8f8 ,\nVtd Vts Vtb\n\n(16)\n\n9\n\n\fwhere cij \u2261 cos \u03b8ij and sij \u2261 sin \u03b8ij for the generation labels i, j = 1, 2, 3 and \u03b413 is a CP\nviolating phase in the quark sector.\n\n3.2\n\nNeutrino masses and their mixing angles\n\nThe left-handed neutrinos are massless in Standard Model because of non-existence of\nright-handed neutrinos and the Weinberg-Salam Higgs field having only weakhypercharge\ny/2 = 1/2, and not y/2 = 1 as is required to give Majorana neutrino a mass. Thus,\nin order to let left-handed neutrinos be massive particles as is very strongly indicated\nby experiments, we assume the existence of the three very heavy right-handed neutrinos,\nwhich are mass-protected so as finally get masses from the \"new\" Higgs field, \u03c6B\u2212L , at\nan energy scale of about 1010 GeV in our present model.\nWe use the gauged B \u2212 L charge to mass-protect the right-handed neutrinos; in fact\nwe use the total \u2013 diagonal \u2013 one in fact we break U(1)B\u2212L,1 \u00d7 U(1)B\u2212L,2 \u00d7 U(1)B\u2212L,3\n\u2283 U(1)B\u2212L at a much higher energy scale, say about 1018 GeV.\nThe assumption of the existence of three right-handed Majorana neutrinos at a high\nscale gives rise to the addition of Majorana mass terms to the Lagrangian:\n1\n1\n\u2212 Lneutrino\u2212mass = \u03bd\u0304L M\u03bdD \u03bdR + (\u03bdL )c ML \u03bdL + (\u03bdR )c MR \u03bdR + h.c.\n2\n2\n1\n= (nL )c M nL + h.c.\n2\nwhere\nnL \u2261\n\n\u03bdL\n(\u03bdL )c\n\n!\n\n, M\u2261\n\nML M\u03bdD\nM\u03bdD MR\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(17)\n\n(18)\n\nHere M\u03bdD is the left-right transition mass term \u2013 Dirac neutrino mass term \u2013 and ML and\nMR are the isosinglet Majorana mass terms of left-handed and right-handed neutrinos,\nrespectively.\nDue to mass-protection by the Standard Model gauge symmetry, the left-handed Majorana mass terms, ML , are negligible in our model with a fundamental scale set by the\nPlanck mass. Then, naturally, the effective light (left-left transition) neutrino mass matrix\ncan be obtained via the see-saw mechanism [5]:\nMeff \u2248 M\u03bdD MR\u22121 (M\u03bdD )T .\n\n(19)\n\nIn the framework of the three active neutrinos model, the flavour eigenstates \u03bd\u03b1 (\u03b1 =\ne, \u03bd, \u03c4 ) are related to the mass eigenstates \u03bdi (i = 1, 2, 3) in the vacuum by a unitary\nmatrix VMNS ,\nX\n(20)\n|\u03bd\u03b1 i = (VMNS )\u03b1i |\u03bdi i .\ni\n\n10\n\n\fHere VMNS is the three-by-three Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (MNS) mixing matrix [8] which\nis parameterised by\n\nVMNS\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\nc\u030312 c\u030313\ns\u030312 c\u030313\ns\u030313 e\u2212i\u03b4\u030313\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\ni\u03b4\u030313\n= \uf8ec\nc\u030312 c\u030323 \u2212 s\u030312 s\u030323 s\u030313 ei\u03b4\u030313\ns\u030323 c\u030313 \uf8f7\n\uf8ed \u2212s\u030312 c\u030323 \u2212 c\u030312 s\u030323 s\u030313 e\n\uf8f8\ns\u030312 s\u030323 \u2212 c\u030312 c\u030323 s\u030313 ei\u03b4\u030313 \u2212c\u030312 s\u030323 \u2212 s\u030312 c\u030323 s\u030313 ei\u03b4\u030313 c\u030323 c\u030313\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\nei\u03c6 0 0\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\u00d7 \uf8ed 0 ei\u03c8 0 \uf8f8 ,\n0\n0 1\n\n(21)\n\nwhere c\u0303ij \u2261 cos \u03b8ij and s\u0303ij \u2261 sin \u03b8ij are the neutrino mixing parameters and \u03b4\u030313 is a\nneutrino CP violating phase. Note that, due to the existence of Majorana neutrinos, we\nhave two additional CP violating Majorana phases \u03c6 and \u03c8, which are also included in\nthe MNS unitary mixing matrix.\nIn order to get predictions for the neutrino masses from the effective mass matrix,\nMeff , we have to diagonalise this matrix using a unitary matrix, Veff , to find the mass\neigenvalues:\n\u2020\n\u2020\nVeff Meff Meff\nVeff\n= diag(m21 , m22 , m23 ) .\n(22)\nWith the charged lepton unitary matrix VE , eq.

This means that we assume essentially maximal CP violation in all sectors,\nincluding the neutrino sector. Since the exact values of all these coupling constants are\nnot known, our model is only able to provide its results order of magnitudewise.\nIn this way, we simulate a long chain of fundamental Yukawa couplings and propagators\nmaking the transition corresponding to an effective Yukawa coupling in the Standard\nModel. In the numerical computation we then calculate the masses and mixing angles\ntime after time, using different sets of random numbers and, in the end, we take the\nlogarithmic average of the calculated quantities according to the following formula:\nN\nX\n\nln mi\nhmi = exp\ni=1 N\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(45)\n\nHere hmi is what we take to be the prediction for one of the masses or mixing angles, mi is\nthe result of the calculation done with one set of random number combinations and N is\nthe total number of random number combinations used. The calculations are done using\na Monte Carlo method by putting in for the order of unity couplings random complex\nnumbers of order unity. Strictly speaking, we just put such random number factors on the\ndifferent mass matrix elements. We then interpret the matrix elements estimated as the\nproducts of a random number of order unity and the Higgs VEVs (suppression factors)\nas the running Yukawa couplings at the scale where the Higgs fields W , T , \u03c1, \u03c9 and \u03c7\nroughly all have their VEVs namely about one order of magnitude below the Planck scale.\nWe ignore running of couplings over this single order of magnitude as not important. We\nthen run down case after case of random numbers the couplings to get the observable\nquantities at the experimental scale, which we take to be 1 GeV as convention so that our\nmasses are running ones at \u03bc = 1 GeV. At first we get the different results for each set of\n13\n\n\frandom numbers, but then we average over the logarithm of these quantities and present\nthe exponents of the average log's, as \"logarithmic averages\". In estimating the quality\nof our fits of the adjustable VEVs we define a quantity which we call the goodness of fit\n(g.o.f.) reminiscent of the chi-square using again the logarithms\ng.o.f. \u2261\n\nX\n\n\"\n\nhmi\nln\nmexp\n\n!#2\n\n.\n\n(46)\n\nIt should be kept in mind that, in our calculations, we use the renormalisation group\n\u03b2-functions to run Yukawa couplings down to the experimentally observable scale 1 GeV.\nThis is because we took the charged fermion masses to be compared to \"measurements\"\nat the conventional scale of 1 GeV, except for the top quark. We used the top quark pole\nmass instead [9]:\n!\n4 \u03b1s (M)\nMt = mt (M) 1 +\n,\n(47)\n3 \u03c0\nwhere we set M = 180 GeV as an input, for simplicity.\n\n5.1\n\nMass matrices\n\nWith the system of quantum numbers in Table 2.3 one can easily evaluate, for a given\nmass matrix element, the numbers of Higgs field VEVs of the different types needed\nto perform the transition between the corresponding left- and right-handed Weyl fields.\nThe results of calculating the products of Higgs fields needed, and thereby the order of\nmagnitudes of the mass matrix elements in our model, are presented in the following mass\nmatrices:\nthe up-type quarks:\n\uf8f6\n\nE\uf8eb\n\nD\n\n\u2020 3\n\u2020 2\n\u03c9\u03c1\u2020 W \u2020 T 2 \u03c9\u03c1\u2020 (W \u2020 )2 T\n(\u03c6WS )\u2020 \uf8ec (\u03c9 ) W T\n\u221a\nW \u2020T 2\n(W \u2020 )2 T \uf8f7\nMU \u2243\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed (\u03c9 \u2020 )4 \u03c1W \u2020 T 2\n2\n(\u03c9 \u2020)4 \u03c1\n1\nW \u2020T \u2020\n\n(48)\n\nthe down-type quarks:\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\u03c9 3 W (T \u2020)2 \u03c9\u03c1\u2020 W (T \u2020 )2 \u03c9\u03c1\u2020 T 3\nh\u03c6WS i\uf8ec 2\nW (T \u2020 )2\nT3 \uf8f7\nMD \u2243 \u221a \uf8ed \u03c9 \u03c1W (T \u2020 )2\n\uf8f8\n2\n2\n2\n\u2020 4\n2\n\u2020 4\n\u03c9 \u03c1W (T )\nW (T )\nWT\n\n(49)\n\nthe charged leptons:\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n(50)\n\n\uf8f6\n\n(51)\n\n\u03c9 3 W (T \u2020)2\n(\u03c9 \u2020 )3 \u03c13 W (T \u2020 )2 (\u03c9 \u2020 )3 \u03c13 W T 4 \u03c7\nh\u03c6WS i \uf8ec 6 \u2020 3\n\uf8f7\n\u2020\n2\nW (T \u2020 )2\nW T 4\u03c7\nME \u2243 \u221a \uf8ed \u03c9 (\u03c1 ) W (T )\n\uf8f8\n2 \u03c9 6(\u03c1\u2020 )3 (W \u2020 )2 T 4\n\u2020 2 4\n(W ) T\nWT\n\nthe Dirac neutrinos:\nM\u03bdD\n\nD\n\nE\uf8eb\n\n\u2020 3\n\u2020 2\n\u2020 3 3\n\u2020 2\n\u2020 3 3\n\u2020 2\n(\u03c6WS )\u2020 \uf8ec (\u03c9\u2020 )3 W \u2020 T 2 (\u03c9 ) \u03c1\u2020 W2 T (\u03c9 ) \u03c1\u2020 W2 T \u03c7 \uf8f7\n\u221a\nW T\nW T \u03c7\n\u2243\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed (\u03c1 ) W T\n2\n\u2020 3\n\u2020 \u2020 \u2020\n\u2020 \u2020 \u2020\n\u2020 \u2020\n(\u03c1 ) W T \u03c7\nW T \u03c7\nW T\n\n14\n\n\fand the Majorana (right-handed) neutrinos:\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\n(\u03c1\u2020 )6 \u03c7\u2020 (\u03c1\u2020 )3 \u03c7\u2020 /2 (\u03c1\u2020 )3 /2\n\uf8ec \u2020 3 \u2020\n\u03c7\u2020\n1 \uf8f7\nMR \u2243 h\u03c6B\u2212L i\uf8ed (\u03c1 ) \u03c7 /2\n\uf8f8\n(\u03c1\u2020 )3 /2\n1\n\u03c7\n\n(52)\n\nIn order to get the true model matrix elements, one must imagine that each matrix\nelement is provided with an order of unity factor, which is unknown within our system\nof assumptions and which, as described above, is taken in our calculation as a complex\nrandom number, later to be logarithmically averaged over as in eq. (45).\nThe off-diagonal elements of the right-handed neutrino mass matrix (eq. 52) are divided by a factor 2 because the symmetric (Majorana) mass matrix gives rise to the same\noff-diagonal term twice, i.e., we avoid the overcounting of the corresponding Feynmann\ndiagrams. However, the element which couples with only one Higgs field should not be\nmultiplied by an extra factor 1/2.\nNote that the quantum numbers of our 6 Higgs fields are not totally independent.

If we supersymmetrised the model\nwe would need to double the Higgs fields and we would loose predictive power, because\nwe would get more parameters.\n\n5.2\n\nRenormalisation group effect on Dirac neutrino Yukawa coupling\n\nIn the previous work [1] we ignored the running of the Yukawa couplings for the neutrino\nsector from the Planck scale down to the see-saw scale and only used the running of\nthe effective dimension five operator (eq. 39), but in the present article we use also the\nrunning of the Dirac Yukawa couplings for the neutrinos above the see-saw scale according\nto eq. (35). By putting in the various values we may estimate that the most important\nterm is the top-Yukawa containing term, YS , which makes the overall size of the neutrino\nDirac Yukawa matrix increase towards the ultraviolet. Since our predictions are a priori\nmade at the Planck scale, this means that inclusion \u221a\nof this running makes the predictions\nfor these Yukawa couplings a bit \u2013 about a factor 2 or less \u2013 smaller at lower energy\nscale.\n15\n\n\f6\n\nResults for the quantities of quarks and leptons\n\nUsing the three charged quark-lepton mass matrices and the effective neutrino mass\nmatrix together with the renormalisation group equations we made a fit to all the fermion\nquantities in Table 2 varying just 6 Higgs fields VEVs. We averaged over N = 10, 000\ncomplex order unity random number combinations (see eq. 45). These complex numbers\nare chosen to be the exponential of a number picked from a Gaussian distribution, with\nmean value zero and standard deviation one, multiplied by a random phase factor that\nhas smoothly distributed phase. We varied the 6 free parameters and found the best\nfit, corresponding to the lowest value for the quantity g.o.f. defined in eq. (46), with the\nfollowing values for the VEVs:\nh\u03c6W S i = 246 GeV , h\u03c6B\u2212L i = 1.23 \u00d7 1010 GeV , h\u03c9i = 0.245 ,\nh\u03c1i = 0.256 , hW i = 0.143 , hT i = 0.0742 , h\u03c7i = 0.0408 ,\n\n(54)\n\nwhere, except for the Weinberg-Salam Higgs field and h\u03c6B\u2212L i, the VEVs are expressed in\nPlanck units. Hereby we have considered that the Weinberg-Salam Higgs field VEV is\nalready fixed by the Fermi constant. The results of the best fit, with the VEVs in eq. (54),\nare shown in Table 2 and the fit has g.o.f. = 3.38 (see the definition in eq. 46).\nWe have 11 = 17q\u2212 6 degrees of freedom \u2013 predictions \u2013 leaving each of them with a\nlogarithmic error of 3.38/11 \u2243 0.55, i.e., we can fit all quantities with a typical error of\na factor exp\n\n\u0010q\n\n\u0011\n\n3.38/11 = 1.74 of the experimental value.\n\nUnlike in older versions of the model, the first and second family sub-matrix of MD is\nnow dominantly diagonal. In previous versions of the model this submatrix satisfied the\norder of magnitude factorisation condition (MD )12 * (MD )21 \u2248 (MD )11 * (MD )22 ; thus the\ndown quark mass md received two contributions (off-diagonal as well as diagonal) of the\nsame order of magnitude as the up quark mass mu . This extra off-diagonal contribution\nto md of course improved the goodness of the fit to the masses of the first family, since\nphenomenologically md \u2248 2 mu . However, in the present version of the model with the\n\u03c9 and \u03c1 Higgs fields, the off-diagonal element (MD )21 becomes smaller and we are left\nwith a full order of magnitude degeneracy of the first family masses, even including the\ndown quark. Our best fit values for the charm quark mass mc and the Cabibbo angle Vus\nare smaller than in our previous fits to the charged fermion masses [6, 11]. Nonetheless,\nas mentioned above, our present best fit agrees with the experimental data within the\ntheoretically expected uncertainty of about 64% and is, therefore, as well as can expect\nfrom an order of magnitude fit.\n\n6.1\n\nNeutrino oscillation parameters\n\nThe charge current interactions from the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) [12] have\nprovided an important signal confirming the existence of the solar neutrino mass [13, 14,\n15, 16, 17]: SNO detected a flux of \u03bd\u03bc neutrino or \u03bd\u03c4 neutrino among solar neutrinos after\n16\n\n\ftraveling from the core of the Sun to the Earth. Combination of the SNO results with\nprevious measurements from other experiments confirms the standard solar model [18],\nwhose predictions of the total flux of active 8 B neutrinos in the Sun agree with the\nSNO and Super-Kamiokande [17] data. Furthermore, the measurement of the 8 B and\nhep solar neutrino fluxes shows no significant energy dependence of the electron neutrino\nsurvival probability in the Super-Kamiokande and SNO energy ranges. In fact, global\nanalyses [19, 20, 21, 22] of solar neutrino data, including the first SNO results and the\nday-night effect [23], which disfavoured the SMA-MSW solution at the 95% C.L., have\nconfirmed that the LMA-MSW solution gives the best fit to the data and that the SMAMSW solution is very strongly disfavoured and only accepted at the 3\u03c3 level.\nFurthermore, the combination of the results from atmospheric neutrino experiments [24]\nand the CHOOZ reactor experiment [25] constrains the first- and third-generation mix< 0.06.

In principle, of course, we have to fit to neutrino parameters from a three flavour\nanalysis.\nThe global three flavour analyses have been done by several authors [26, 27, 28, 29] and\nthey showed a significant influence of the non-zero CHOOZ angle on the solar neutrino\nmass squared difference and mixing angle. In [29] the relatively large solar neutrino mass\n> 10\u22124 eV2 ),\nsquared difference lying in the LMA-MSW region (with the condition \u2206m2\u2299 \u223c\nthe solar mixing angle and the CHOOZ reactor experiment data were analysed using the\nthree flavour analysis method. Their works tell us that if the CHOOZ angle becomes bigger than zero then the solar mixing angle becomes smaller. This effect is more significant\nfor the larger \u2206m2\u2299 values. Because of this correlation, our fit to the neutrino data should\nbe somewhat better than that suggested by the g.o.f. value; even including the CHOOZ\nangle our neutrino fit is extremely good.\nExperimental results on the values of neutrino mixing angles are usually presented in\nterms of the function sin2 2\u03b8 rather than tan2 \u03b8 (which, contrary to sin2 2\u03b8, does not have\na maximum at \u03b8 = \u03c0/4 and thus still varies in this region). Transforming from tan2 \u03b8\nvariables to sin2 2\u03b8 variables, our predictions for the neutrino mixing angles become:\nsin2 2\u03b8\u2299 = 0.61 ,\nsin2 2\u03b8atm = 0.99 ,\nsin2 2\u03b8chooz = 0.12 .\n\n(55)\n(56)\n(57)\n\nWe also give here our predicted hierarchical neutrino mass spectrum:\nm1 = 9.8 \u00d7 10\u22124 eV ,\nm2 = 9.6 \u00d7 10\u22123 eV ,\nm3 = 4.4 \u00d7 10\u22122 eV .\n\n(58)\n(59)\n(60)\n\nCompared to the experimental data these predictions are excellent: all of our order\nof magnitude neutrino predictions lie inside the 95% C.L. border determined from phenomenological fits to the neutrino data, even including the CHOOZ upper bound. On the\nother hand, our prediction of the solar mass squared difference is a factor of 2 larger than\nthe global fit data even though the prediction is inside of the LMA-MSW region, giving\na contribution to our goodness of fit \u2248 0.12.\n\u221a\nOur CHOOZ angle also turns out to be about a factor of 2 larger than the experimental limit at 90% C.L., corresponding to another contribution of g.o.f. \u2248 0.014. In\nsummary our predictions for the neutrino sector agree extremely well with the data, giving a contribution of only 0.25 to g.o.f. while the charged fermion sector contributes 3.13\nto g.o.f.\n18\n\n\fNote that the value of h\u03c6B\u2212L i presented in Table 2 does not\n\u221a fit very well the atmospheric neutrino mass squared difference, being about factor 2 less than the best fit\nreported by Super-Kamiokande collaboration [24]. That means that our model predicts\n\"relative\" degenerated mass spectra in the neutrino sector. However, if we force it to fit\nthe value of mass squared difference as \u2206m2atm = 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22123 eV2 and just arrange the\nscale, h\u03c6B\u2212L i, of the mass squared differences \u2013 it will not significantly influence the ratio\nof mass squared differences \u2013 thus we get \u2206m2\u2299 = 1.2 \u00d7 10\u22124 eV2 which lays still in the\nallowed region of the global fit of the solar neutrino analysis:\nh\u03c6B\u2212L i\n\ncorrected\n\n\u2206m2atm\n\ncorrected\n\n\u2206m2\u2299\n\ncorrected\n\n= 1.0 \u00d7 1010 GeV ,\n= 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22123 eV2 ,\n\n= 1.2 \u00d7 10\u22124 eV2 .\n\n(61)\n(62)\n(63)\n\nand the CHOOZ angle does not change tan2 \u03b8chooz = 3.3 \u00d7 10\u22122 in this small deviation of\nthe see-saw scale.\n\n6.2\n\nCP violation\n\nSince we have taken our random couplings to be \u2013 whenever allowed \u2013 complex we have\norder of unity or essentially maximal CP violation so that a unitary triangle with angles\nof order one is a success of our model. After our fitting of masses and of mixings we can\nsimply predict order of magnitudewise the CP violation in e.g. K 0\u2212K\u0304 0 decay or in CKM\nand MNS mixing matrices in general.\nThe Jarlskog area JCP provides a measure of the amount of CP violation in the quark\nsector [30] and, in the approximation of setting cosines of mixing angles to unity, is just\ntwice the area of the unitarity triangle:\nJCP = Vus Vcb Vub sin \u03b4 ,\n\n(64)\n\nwhere \u03b4 is the CP violation phase in the CKM matrix. In our model the quark mass\nmatrix elements have random phases, so we expect \u03b4 (and also the three angles \u03b1, \u03b2\nand \u03b3 of the unitarity triangle) to be of order unity and, taking an average value of\n|sin \u03b4| \u2248 1/2, the area of the unitarity triangle becomes\nJCP \u2248\n\n1\nVus Vcb Vub .\n2\n\n(65)\n\nUsing the best fit values for the CKM elements from Table 2, we predict JCP \u2248 3.0\u00d710\u22126 to\nbe compared with the experimental value (2\u22123.5)\u00d710\u22125 . Since our result for the Jarlskog\narea is the product of four\n\u221a quantities, we do not expect the usual \u00b164% logarithmic\nuncertainty but rather \u00b1 4 * 64% = 128% logarithmic uncertainty. This means our result\n\u22125\n)/1.28 = 1.7 \"standard deviations\".\ndeviates from the experimental value by ln( 2.7\u00d710\n3.0\u00d710\u22126\nThe Jarlskog area has been calculated from the best fit parameters in Table 2, it is\nalso possible to calculate them directly while making the fit. So we have calculated JCP\n19\n\n\ffor N = 10, 000 complex order unity random number combinations. Then we took the\nlogarithmic average of these 10, 000 samples of JCP and obtained the following result:\nJCP = 3.0 \u00d7 10\u22126 ,\n\n(66)\n\nin good agreement with the values given above.\n\n6.3\n\nNeutrinoless double beta decay\n\nAnother prediction, which can also be made from this model, is the electron \"effective\nMajorana mass\" \u2013 the parameter in neutrinoless beta decay \u2013 defined by:\n|hmi| \u2261\n\n3\nX\n\nUei2 mi ,\n\n(67)\n\ni=1\n\nwhere mi are the masses of the neutrinos \u03bdi and Uei are the MNS mixing matrix elements\nfor the electron flavour to the mass eigenstates i. We can substitute values for the neutrino\nmasses mi from eqs. (58-60) and for the fitted neutrino mixing angles from Table 2 into\nthe left hand side of eq. (67). As already mentioned, the CP violating phases in the MNS\nmixing matrix are essentially random in our model. So we combine the three terms in\neq. (67) by taking the square root of the sum of the modulus squared of each term, which\ngives our prediction:\n|hmi| \u2248 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22123 eV .\n(68)\nIn the same way as being calculated the Jarlskog area we can compute using N =\n10, 000 complex order unity random number combinations to get the |hmi|. Then we took\nthe logarithmic average of these 10, 000 samples of |hmi| as usual:\n|hmi| = 3.4 \u00d7 10\u22123 eV .\n\n(69)\n\nThis result does not agree with the central value of recent result \u2013 \"evidence\" \u2013 from the\nHeidelberg-Moscow collaboration [31].\n\n7\n\nBaryogenesis via lepton number violation\n\nNow we have a good model which predicts orders of magnitude for all the Yukawa\ncouplings including the see-saw particles, so it is natural to ask ourselves whether this\nmodel can predict also the right amount of YB \u2013 the ratio of the baryon numbers density\nrelative to the entropy density \u2013 using the Fukugita-Yanagida mechanism [32]. According\nto this mechanism the decays of the right-handed neutrinos by CP violating couplings\nlead to an excess of the B \u2212 L charge (baryon number minus lepton number), the relative\nexcess in the decay from Majorana neutrino generation number i being called \u01ebi . This\nexcess is then immediately \u2013 and continuously back and forth \u2013 being converted partially\n20\n\n\fto a baryon number excess, although it starts out as being a lepton number L asymmetry,\nsince the right-handed neutrinos decay into leptons and Weinberg-Salam Higgs particles.\nIt is a complicated discussion to estimate to what extend the B \u2212 L asymmetry is\nwashed-out later in the cosmological development, but in our approximation below we\nagree within a factor 3 with the baryon number excess left to fit the Big Bang development at the stage of formation of the light elements primordially (nuclearsynthesis).\nThe \"experimental\" data of the ratio of baryon number density to the entropy density is\nobtained by recent measurement of cosmic microwave background radiation [33]:\nYB\n\nexp\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\n+1.5\n\u00d7 10\u221211 .\n= 8.5\n\u22121.0\n\n(70)\n\nRecently, baryogenesis calculations had been done by several authors [34] using different models based on this scenario, and they used \"usual\" range of YB :\nYB\n\nexp\n\n= (1.7 \u2212 8.1) \u00d7 10\u221211 .\n\n(71)\n\nIn the following subsection, we review briefly the already known Fukugita-Yanagida\nmechanism.\n\n7.1\n\nFukugita-Yanagida scenario for lepton number production\n\nThe SU(2) instantons [35], rather say, Sphaleron [36] guaranteed the rapid exchanges\nof the minus baryon number and lepton number in which though B \u2212 L is conserved in\nthe time of Big Bang, even when the temperature was above the weak scale. In fact\nthe three right-handed neutrinos decay in the B \u2212 L violating way, at the temperature\nabout the see-saw mass scales. This means that the baryon number is violated. From\nour assumption \u2013 all fundamental coupling constants are of order of unity and we treat\nthem as complex random numbers at the Planck scale \u2013 it is clear that the model has not\nonly C violation but also CP violation. Out-of-equilibrium condition comes about during\nthe Hubble expansion due to the excess of the three type of the right-handed Majorana\nneutrinos caused by their masses.\nThese statements lead to that all Sakharov conditions [37] are fulfilled in our model: (1)\nbaryon number violation, (2) C and CP violation, (3) departure from thermal equilibrium.\n\n7.2\n\nEntropy density in cosmology\n\nIn order to investigate the quantity, YB , we need the expression for the entropy of Planck\nradiation which is given by\n2\u03c0 2 g\u2217 i 3\nsi =\nT ,\n(72)\n45\nwhere g\u2217 i is the total number of effectively massless degrees of freedom of the plasma\nat the temperature of the right-handed neutrino, and the index i denotes the number of\n21\n\n\fcopiously existing right-handed neutrinos at the time in question. For the estimate of\nthe excess of baryon number coming from a certain right-handed neutrino i, we should\ncompare to the entropy density at the temperature being approximately equal to the mass\nof the corresponding right-handed neutrino.\nThe g\u2217 i are obtained as follows: There are 14 bosons and 45 well-known Weyl fermions\nplus i Majorana particles when the temperature is high enough compared to 102 GeV:\ng\u2217 i =\n\nX\n\ngj\n\nj=bosons\n\n\u0012\n\nTj\nT\n\n\u00134\n\n+\n\n\u0012\n\n7 X\nTj\ngj\n8 j=fermions\nT\n\n\u00134\n\n7\n7\n* 90 +\n*i\n{z8\n}\n|\n|4{z }\nStandrad Model see-saw particles\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 108.5 : i = 1\n110.25 : i = 2 ,\n=\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n112 : i = 3\n\n=\n\n28 +\n\n(73)\n\nhere Tj denotes the effective temperature of any species j. When we have coupling as at\nthe stage discussed between all the particles Tj = T .\n\n7.3\n\nCP violation in decays of the Majorana neutrinos\n\nA right-handed neutrino, NR i , decays into a Weinberg-Salam Higgs particle and a lefthanded lepton or into the CP conjugate channel: These two channels have different lepton\nnumbers \u00b11. If there were no CP violation they would have the same branching ratio.\nHowever, all Yukawa couplings are complex order unity random numbers, therefore the\npartial widths do not have to be equal in the next-to-leading-order of perturbation theory:\nCP violation in the decay of right-handed neutrinos.\nDefining the measure \u01ebi for the CP violation\nP\n\n\u03b1,\u03b2\n\n\u01ebi \u2261 P\n\n\u03b1,\u03b2\n\n\u0393(NR i \u2192 l\u03b1 \u03c6\u03b2W S ) \u2212\n\u0393(NR i \u2192 l\u03b1 \u03c6\u03b2W S ) +\n\nP\n\nP\n\n\u03b1,\u03b2\n\n\u03b1,\u03b2\n\n\u0393(NR i \u2192 l\u0304\u03b1 \u03c6\u03b2\u2020\n)\nWS\n\n\u0393(NR i \u2192 l\u0304\u03b1 \u03c6\u03b2\u2020\nWS)\n\n,\n\n(74)\n\nwhere \u0393 are NR i decay rates (in the NR i rest frame), summed over the neutral and charged\nleptons (and Weinberg-Salam Higgs fields) which appear as final states in the NR i decays\none sees that the excess of leptons over anti-leptons produced in the decay of one NR i is\njust \u01ebi . Now we shall calculate \u01ebi in perturbation theory: The total decay rate at the tree\nlevel (Fig. 2(a)) is given by\n\u0393Ni = \u0393Ni l + \u0393Ni l\u0304 =\n\ngD )\u2020 M\ng\nD\n((M\n\u03bd\n\u03bd )ii\nMi ,\n4\u03c0 h\u03c6W S i2\n\n(75)\n\ngD can be expressed through the unitary matrix diagonalising the right-handed\nwhere M\n\u03bd\nneutrino mass matrix VR :\ngD \u2261 M D V ,\nM\nR\n\u03bd\n\u03bd\n\n22\n\n(76)\n\n\f\u0001\u0002\u0003\nl\n\nNi\n\nl\n\nl\n\nNj\n\nNi\n\nNj\n\nNi\n\n\u03c6W S\n\n\u03c6W S\n\n\u03c6W S\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 2: Tree level (a), self-energy (b) and vertex (c) diagrams contributing to heavy\nMajorana neutrino decays.\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n.\n\nMj2\nMi2\n\n!\n\nVR\u2020 MR MR\u2020 VR = diag M12 , M22 , M32\n\n(77)\n\nThe CP violation in the Majorana neutrino decays, \u01ebi , arises when the effects of loop are\ntaken into account, and at the one-loop level, the CP asymmetry comes both from the\nwave function renormalisation (Fig. 2(b)) and from the vertex (Fig. 2(c)) [38, 39, 40]:\n\u01ebi =\n\n1\ngD )\u2020 M\ngD )\n4\u03c0 h\u03c6W S i2 ((M\n\u03bd\n\u03bd ii\n\nX\nj6=i\n\n\"\n\ngD )\u2020 M\ngD )2 ] f\nIm[((M\n\u03bd\n\u03bd ji\n\nMj2\n+g\nMi2\n\n!#\n\n,\n\n(78)\n\nwhere the function, f (x), comes from the one-loop vertex contribution and the other\nfunction, g(x), comes from the self-energy contribution. These \u01eb's can be calculated in\nperturbation theory only for differences between Majorana neutrino masses which are sufficiently large compare to their decay widths, i.e., the mass splittings satisfy the condition,\n|Mi \u2212 Mj | \u226b |\u0393i \u2212 \u0393j |:\n\u0015\n\u221a \u0014\n1+x\n,\nf (x) =\nx 1 \u2212 (1 + x) ln\nx\n\u221a\nx\ng(x) =\n.\n1\u2212x\n\n(79)\n(80)\n\nThe function f (x) has for large x \"tricky\" cancellations, so for numerical calculation we\nuse following approximation in the region x \u226b 1, i.e., hierarchical case in the right-handed\nsector:\n1\nf (x) \u2243 \u2212 \u221a .\n(81)\n2 x\n\n7.4\n\nOff-diagonal dominant matrix elements in the see-saw neutrino mass matrix\n\nThe main modification in the model \u2013 and not only in the calculation \u2013 compared to the\nlatest version is that we changed the quantum number assignment of the see-saw scale\n23\n\n\ffitting Higgs field, \u03c6B\u2212L , so that it instead of giving directly and thus unsuppressed the\n(3, 3) mass matrix element, i.e., a diagonal one, it gives in the present version unsuppressed\nsize to the (2, 3) and (3, 2) mass matrix elements in this see-saw neutrino mass matrix\n(eq. 52). By having such off-diagonal dominance one expects a large mixing of the second\nand third generation at least in the see-saw mass matrix and expect to get easily a large\nCHOOZ angle tan2 \u03b8chooz . However, as we have already presented in the section 6, we still\ndo fit the CHOOZ angle limit satisfactorily.\nThe gain by having this off-diagonal dominance is, however, crucial for the baryon\nnumber production in the early Universe via the Fukugita-Yanagida mechanism: By having now the two heaviest see-saw neutrinos almost degenerate in mass the interaction\nbetween these two levels become much enhanced and this causes the CP violation as\nexpressed by the \u01ebi 's for the two heaviest Majorana neutrinos to be bigger, as is easily\nunderstood by noticing the factor f (x) + g(x) occurring in the expression (eq. 78), which\nis in first approximation a suppression factor given by the ratio of the see-saw neutrino\nmasses [41, 42]. With the mass difference becoming small compared to the masses themselves the term g(x) can even become big compared to unity, so that one might see the\npossibility of these normally suppressing factors causing an enhancement. However, there\nare in the case with two such close Majorana neutrinos a strong cancellation between the\namounts of B \u2212 L produced in excess by these almost mass degenerate particles decaying. Nevertheless we can avoid significantly the suppression by having such degeneracy,\ntherefore the baryon number production increases.\n\n8\n\nAn approximation to the wash-out effect\n\nThe excess B \u2212 L produced at first gets partly destroyed by the same or other B \u2212 L\nviolating processes. There are several processes/Feynmann diagrams that can lead to\nB \u2212 L violation and thus wash-out an excess. Most important at the temperature scale of\nthe right-handed neutrino masses are the resonance scattering of a Weinberg-Salam Higgs\ntowards a left-handed lepton producing one of the Majorana neutrinos as a resonance.\nThe rate of forming resonances this way is proportional to the width \u0393i of the see-saw\nneutrino functioning as resonance from detailed balance. Since the time scale involved is\ngiven by the Hubble expansion at the time of the temperature being equal to the mass of\nthe see-saw neutrino, a crucial parameter for the wash-out effect via the resonance process\nis\ngD )\u2020 M\ngD )\n\u0393i\nMPlanck\n((M\n\u03bd\n\u03bd ii\nKi \u2261\n=\n(i = 1, 2, 3) ,\n(82)\n1/2\n2\nT\n=M\ni\n2H\nMi\n1.66 h\u03c6W S i 8\u03c0g\u2217 i\n\nwhere \u0393i is the width of the flavour i Majorana neutrino, Mi is its mass and g\u2217 i is the\nnumber of degrees of freedom at the temperature Mi .\n\nAs the time goes in early cosmology, the heaviest see-saw neutrino goes out-of-thermalequilibrium first and deploys its excess of B \u2212 L, then the next and so on. Thus in the\nhierarchical case \u2013 but, our model is not this case in as far as the two heaviest see-saw\n24\n\n\fneutrinos are approximately degenerate in mass \u2013 the excess produced by the lightest seesaw neutrino will roughly only be washed out by itself but not by the heavier neutrinos,\nsince the latter resonances are not reachable at the temperature at that time. However,\nthe excess from the decay of the heavier see-saw neutrinos can be washed out by the\nlighter one(s), and if some are degenerate they may wash out the products of each other.\nNow the flavours of the left-handed leptons produced in excess in the decays are not the\nsame for the three different see-saw neutrinos. They are, however, also not orthogonal\nstates because they are mixing almost maximally. This means that wash-out due to one\nsee-saw neutrino of the excess caused by another one is suppressed compared to what the\nwash-out rate would be when a see-saw neutrino washes out its own production of excess.\nWe shall take into account such suppressions by constructing some effective Ki called Keff i\nwhich should mean that value of Ki to use as if we had the excess of the \u03bdR i washed out\nby itself, so as to obtain in practice the effect of the wash-out due to the other see-saw\nneutrinos included. The decay products of a given see-saw neutrino are found from the\nYukawa couplings of this right-handed neutrino to a Weinberg-Salam Higgs and a lefthanded lepton, and these couplings are proportional to the M\u03bdD -mass matrix elements.\nWe \u2013 crudely \u2013 shall estimate Keff i expressions in terms of Ki 's which are the parameters\nfor the wash-out of the products of the right-handed see-saw neutrinos itself, where i = 1\nis the lightest and three (i = 3) the heaviest.\nIn order to estimate the effective K factors we first introduce some normalized state\nvectors for the decay products:\n|ii \u2261 r\n\n1\n\nP3\n\nk=1\n\nh\n\ngD (M )\nM\ni\n\u03bd\n\ni\n\n2\nki\n\nand further define their overlap:\n\n\u0010h\n\ngD (M )\nM\ni\n\u03bd\n\ni\n\n1i\n\nh\n\ngD (M )\n, M\ni\n\u03bd\n\ni\n\n2i\n\nh\n\ngD (M )\n, M\ni\n\u03bd\n\ni \u0011\n3i\n\n,\n\n(83)\n\n\u03b6ij \u2261 |hi|ji|2 .\n\n(84)\n\nKeff 1 = K1 (M1 ) ,\nKeff 2 = K2 (M2 ) + \u03b623 K3 (M3 ) + \u03b621 K1 (M1 ) ,\nKeff 3 = K3 (M3 ) + \u03b632 K2 (M2 ) + \u03b631 K1 (M1 ) .\n\n(85)\n(86)\n(87)\n\nThen we may take an approximation for the effective K factors:\n\nStrictly speaking, one shall namely not imagine the excesses to flow around as left-handed\nleptons only, because there is with high rate the weak instanton or Sphaleron activity\nconverting e.g. lepton number into minus baryon number. Since, however, the instanton\nprocess at the same time convert one particle from every generation, there remains the\nsame excess of one generation over the other even after the instanton-process. Thus we\nexpect that the assumed suppressed wash-out effect from a different see-saw neutrino\nworks anyway. We have for simplicity ignored the scattering processes due to exchange\nprocesses as candidates for wash-out effects, expecting that at the temperature scales\nrelevant they will effectively be small due to cross-section going as the fourth power of\nDirac neutrino Yukawa couplings rather than the square as does the resonance crosssection averaged over energy.\n25\n\n\f8.1\n\nThe dilution factors\n\nWhen the Keff 's are not small (not less than one), we have to take into account the dilution\neffects \u2013 wash-out effects \u2013 for the calculation. Therefore, we define the suppression factor\n\u03bai to be fraction of B \u2212 L excess produced by the right-handed neutrino number i which\nsurvives.

At first, we present the see-saw neutrino\nmasses then Keff i 's using N = 10, 000 random number combinations and logarithmic\naverage:\nM1 = 2.1 \u00d7 105 GeV ,\nM2 = 8.8 \u00d7 109 GeV ,\nM3 = 9.9 \u00d7 109 GeV ,\n\n(96)\n(97)\n(98)\n\nKeff 1 = 31.6 ,\nKeff 2 = 116.2 ,\nKeff 3 = 114.7 .\n\n(99)\n(100)\n(101)\n\nand\n\nThe numerical results of our best fitting VEVs also gives the \u01ebi 's using same method:\n|\u01eb1 | = 4.62 \u00d7 10\u221212 ,\n|\u01eb2 | = 4.00 \u00d7 10\u22126 ,\n|\u01eb3 | = 3.27 \u00d7 10\u22126 .\n\n(102)\n(103)\n(104)\n\nThe sign of \u01ebi is unpredictable due to the complex random number coefficients in mass\nmatrices, therefore we are not in the position to say the sign of \u01eb's. It turns out that\nwe should calculate directly YB instead of putting the results from eqs. (96)-(98) and\neqs. (102)-(104) using the dilution factor formulae into eq. (95). Using the complex order\nunity random numbers being given by a Gaussian distribution we get after logarithmic\naverage\n+17.0\nYB = 2.59\n\u00d7 10\u221211 ,\n(105)\n\u22122.25\nhereby \u221a\nwe estimate the uncertainty in the natural exponent according ref. [11] to be\n64 % * 10 \u2248 200 %. Dominantly the signs of \u01ebi are strongly correlated, therefore,\nwe included in the numerical calculation using eq. (95) the correlation of signs effects\ncorrectly.\nThe other remark of the scale dependence for our prediction is on the baryogenesis\ncalculation: It is obvious that the quantities, \u01ebi , are approximately independent of the\nscale h\u03c6B\u2212L i from the eq. (78). In fact these quantities are influenced by only the ratio\nof the different mass eigenstates of the right-handed neutrino, and in addition through\nthe Dirac neutrino Yukawa couplings which are, of course, depended on the see-saw scale\nvia renormalisation group equations. However, a small deviation of the see-saw scale can\n27\n\n\fnot contribute significantly. The number of degrees of freedom, g\u2217i , does not depend on\nthe see-saw scale. However, the dilution factors, rather say, the Keff i factors are strongly\ninfluenced by the right-handed scale, i.e., inverse power of the right-handed neutrino\nmasses (see eq. 82). Strictly speaking, the wash-out effect is proportional to the see-saw\nscale. Using the \"right\" value of the see-saw scale which we mention in above (eq. 61) we\nget the corresponding Keff 's as following\nKeff 1\nKeff 2\nKeff 3\n\ncorrected\ncorrected\ncorrected\n\n= 37.60 ,\n\n(106)\n\n= 138.8 ,\n\n(107)\n\n= 137.1 .\n\n(108)\n\nThe corresponding result of baryon asymmetry is\nYB\n\ncorrected\n\n= 2.02\n\n+13.3\n\u00d7 10\u221211 .\n\u22121.75\n\n(109)\n\nThis result is a bit smaller than the result in eq. (105), however, still in allowed region of\nthe \"experimental\" data in eq. (71).\n\n10\n\nProton decay\n\nIt should be mentioned that our non-supersymmetric model passes without any trouble the test of not predicting proton decay that should have been observed in present\nexperiment. Indeed we have in our model desert, except for the see-saw neutrinos and\nassociated Higgs, \u03c6B\u2212L , and gauge U(1)B\u2212L fields, up to about one order of magnitude\nbelow the Planck scale.\nA reasonable suggestion is that the baryon decay causing bosons would have masses\nof the order of the scale around the VEVs of our Higgs fields, which typically are about\na factor 10 below the Planck scale (see eq. (54)). We should therefore use such a boson\nwith mass about 1.2 \u00d7 1018 GeV. That is to say we could essentially use the formula for\nthe life time of the proton \u03c4p in simple SU(5) GUT with replaced mass of X-particle by\n1.2 \u00d7 1018 GeV. We could take for instance the expression for the p \u2192 \u03c0 0 e+ channel [45]:\n\u03c4(p\u2192\u03c00 e+ )\n\n1\n= 8 \u00d7 1034 years *\n=\n\u0393(p \u2192 \u03c0 0 e+ )\n\n0.015 GeV3\n\u03b1H\n\n!2\n\n*\n\n\u0012\n\nMV\n1016 GeV\n\n\u00134\n\n, (110)\n\nwhere \u03b1H is the hadronic matrix element and MV the mass of the GUT gauge boson,\nand insert 1.2 \u00d7 1018 GeV. Then we get crudely our prediction assuming the existence of\nbosons which break baryon number at this scale:\n\u03c4(p\u2192\u03c00 e+ ) \u2248 1043 years .\n\n(111)\n\nHowever, non of the Higgs fields and gauge bosons, which we truly consider in our\nmodel would be able to cause baryon decay. In fact we have excluded by our assumption\n28\n\n\fabout our gauge group the possibility of a gauge boson that could have made transitions\nbetween quarks and leptons: we excluded, namely, gauge bosons unifying different, irreducible representations of the Standard Model, and of course \u2013 it is well-known \u2013 quarks\nand leptons belong to different irreducible representations. Concerning the possibility\nthat our scalar fields (Higgs fields) considered be able to cause baryon decay, it should be\nremarked that since they are made to break our gauge group (eq. 1) but to leave unbroken the Standard Model gauge group. Therefore, they must contain a singlet under the\ndiagonal group in order not to break the diagonal SU(3) \u2013 QCD gauge group. Then it\nfollows that they must under this diagonal SU(3) have triality t = 0 (mod 1) (see below\neq. (2)). In turn, that means that these Higgs fields are not able to couple to neither two\nquarks nor to a pair of a quark and a lepton. That makes our scalar fields of no practical\nuse for baryon decay since to look for three quarks coming together to form one point\nparticle at a scale of 1018 GeV is too much requirement.\nIf we keep to truly postulated particles in our model we would have to wait for proton\ndecay till we can get sensitive to it from Planck scale masses inserted for MV . Taken this\nattitude of only using \"the everything\" that can be found at Planck scale will lead to a\n104 times longer proton life time prediction in our model:\n\u03c4(p\u2192\u03c00 e+ )\n\nPlanck\n\n\u2248 1047 years .\n\n(112)\n\nIn any case there is no chance in foreseeable future to observe proton decay according\nto the suggestions of our model \u2013 however presumably \u2013 this is a point that could be\nmodified without changing our model too drastically.\n\n11\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have set up a model for calculating all the mass matrices for quarks and leptons \u2013\nhere under especially the effective left-handed neutrino mass matrix which is obtained via\nthe well-known see-saw mechanism using a set of three see-saw neutrinos, two of which\nare approximately degenerate in mass. We have fit all the masses and mixing angles\nwithin the accuracy which we theoretically expect to be \u00b164% (on a logarithmic scale)\nfor the quantities for instance quark and lepton masses which are essentially directly\ngiven by mass matrix elements. In fact even our worst deviations of our predictions\nform experiment are of these to mass matrices simply related quantities: we predict the\ncharm quark mass and the Cabibbo angle a factor two lower than experiment, while we\nobtain the electron and the strange mass a factor two larger. On the other hand, the\nsquared quantities of neutrino oscillations presented in Table 2 do not even deviate a\nfactor two. The CP violating parameter \u2013 Jarlskog triangle area \u2013, JCP , and the baryon\nnumber relative to the entropy ratio, YB , arise as products and ratios of several mass\nmatrix elements and thus have larger expected uncertainties, and turn out indeed to\nagree quite within the expected accuracy both being predicted to the low side of \"data\".\nIn conclusion we fit all the Standard Model parameters related to the mass matrices within\nthe expected order of magnitude accuracy, i.e., we fitted 9 masses of quark and charged\n29\n\n\fleptons, 2 mass squared differences for neutrinos, 5 genuinely measured mixing angles, the\nJarlskog triangle area and the baryon number to entropy density ratio. In addition, we\nmanaged to avoid violating the bounds for proton decay life time and neutrinoless double\nbeta decay. Most interestingly we predicted the CHOOZ mixing angle \u2013 the mixing angle\nof the electron neutrino with the heaviest eigenmass neutrino \u2013 only about 15% above the\nexperimental limit (completely allowed order of magnitudewise). In this way we predicted\nsuccessfully 18 genuinely measured parameters not given by the Standard Model itself,\nand that we did with only 6 adjustable parameters \u2013 the vacuum expectation values of\nHiggs fields \u2013 in our model. This means that we made 18 \u2212 6 = 12 genuine predictions in\naddition to avoiding limits giving potential problems for most interestingly the CHOOZ\nangle, the proton life time and the neutrinoless double \u03b2-decay, however, we also did not\npredict the rate of \u03bc \u2192 e + \u03b3 nor similar suppressed processes with any problematic rate.\nIf one takes it as we mentioned in the earlier article [1] that the smallness of the fine\nstructure constants in a model with our gauge group is understandable as being really of\norder unity except for the 4\u03c0 in \u03b1i = gi2 /4\u03c0 and the corrections from the break down to\ndiagonal subgroup, we can claim that we have understood with our model all the orders\nof magnitudes of the couplings and parameters of the Standard Model in terms of only\n7 vacuum expectation values [46] (if we should claim the VEV of Weinberg-Salam Higgs\nas understood we would, of course, have to include it simply as a seventh parameters\nbecause we have not explained the hierarchy of the weak to Planck scale).\nWe did obtain this impressive fit order of magnitudewise in a model with the gauge\ngroup eq. (1) and by a very data inspired choice of the gauge quantum numbers of our seven\nHiggs fields. We have, however, good reasons to claim that the precise detailed structure\nof our gauge group is not important, especially in as far as we in reality only needed\nto use the abelian part of the extension of the Standard Model group. The presumably\nonly important thing is that the gauge group is sufficiently large, so that it separates the\nvarious Weyl components of the quarks and the leptons, in order to accomplish the various\nmass matrix element suppressions needed. On the other hand, the gauge group should\nnot be so large as to include SU(5) or other Grand unification gauge group, since that\ntends to give exact mass relations which become a severe problem to avoid, except for the\n\u03c4 \u2212 b mass relation. Our gauge group were the biggest one represented on the supposed\nthree heavy neutrinos and the 45 already observed Weyl quark and lepton components\nand avoiding such unwanted unifications. However, such a large gauge group is far from\nbeing needed although it must be considered the suggestion of the present article that a\nrelatively large group mainly abelian or, at least, not too much \"unifying\" is what could\nfit very well the \"small hierarchies\" of quark and lepton masses and mixings.\nThe choices of the specific quantum numbers for our seven Higgs fields represents an\nopportunity of a sort of discrete fitting in the sense that we adjust these quantum numbers\nto be able to fit the masses and mixings. Historically we developed the quantum number\nproposals making small changes gradually along so as to incorporate new experimental\ndata. For example the fields \u03c7 and \u03c6B\u2212L were introduced to cope with the neutrino\noscillations, and previous Higgs fields (called S and \u03be) were replaced by the fields \u03c1 and\n\u03c9 in order to fit the Large Mixing Angel MSW solar neutrino solution, which became\n30\n\n\ffavoured strongly during the development period of our model.\nFinally the new step of development in the present article is that the quantum numbers of the field \u03c6B\u2212L got modified to make the two heaviest see-saw neutrinos become\ndegenerate in mass only deviating by a relatively small mass difference of the order of the\nsuppression factor associated with the VEV of the field \u03c7 being small. Thereby we could\nenhance the CP violation in the decay of the heavier see-saw neutrinos, thus achieving\na larger baryon number. The latter were needed in as far as the previous version of the\nmodel, which did not have such a degeneracy, gave too little baryon number excess.\nAlthough in the present model we get somewhat more wash-out effect we still get closer\nto the from Big Bang fitting estimated baryon number density relative to entropy density,\nand we predict it only a factor three (see\u221aeq. 105) below the experimental data, and that\nshould be counted as only ln(8.5/2.59)/( 10 * 0.64) = 0.59 \"standard deviations\"!\n\n11.1\n\nHow does the model function?\n\nA few comments about how the model functions may be on its place: The diagonal\nelements in the four Dirac mass matrices \u2013 the two for quarks, the charged leptons,\nand the \"neutrino Dirac mass matrix\" \u2013 are suppressed to just the same degree in all\nthese four matrices. This is so because the quantum number exchanges needed to uphold\nthese elements are just those of a conventional Standard Model Weinberg-Salam Higgs\nfield, however, taken as the family quantum number for that family that corresponds to\nthe number of the diagonal matrix element in question. This gives at first an order of\nmagnitude degeneracy of quarks and leptons in the same family at the Planck scale of\nrunning couplings, a result that is good for simulating SU(5) GUT predictions \u2013 only order\nof magnitudewise \u2013 and for explaining the crude degeneracy of up-quark and electron mass\n(when extrapolated to Planck scale). However, the Charm quark and top-quark masses\nneed to be explained as shooting up due to some special mechanism, and we managed to\nget them dominated by off-diagonal elements. Due to that the first family gets its mass\nmatrix elements using \u03c1 and \u03c9 together with the Higgs fields already used to give the\nsecond family masses one tends to get just the same extra factor of the \u03c13 \u223c \u03c9 3 type\nand for mixing angles/off-diagonal elements \u03c9\u03c1\u2020 . There is as a result in such models\neasily achievable factorisation of the mixing angles for the quarks and for the neutrinos,\nrespectively, at the Planck scale:\nVub \u2248 Vus Vcb ,\n\u03b8chooz \u2248 \u03b8\u2299 \u03b8atm .\n\n(113)\n(114)\n\nThis going to first family via the second family just getting an extra \u03c9 3 or \u03c9\u03c1\u2020 roughly\nis also behind how in our model we get much less hierarchy among the left-handed neutrinos than for the charged quarks and leptons. In fact the lightness of the right-handed\nneutrinos \"of first generation\" gives a large propagator largely being compensated by the\ncorresponding smallness of the first family Dirac mass matrix elements. So the much less\n31\n\n\fhierarchy for the neutrinos have a rather natural explanation. This fact supports the\nsee-saw mechanism and thereby the Fukugita-Yanagida scheme.\nHowever, we should admit that the rather large neutrino mixing angles in our model\nare obtained by making it possible to fit them to be of order unity. We use e.g. for\nthe achievement of the large atmospheric neutrino mixing angle the adjustment of the \u03c7\nvacuum expectation value so as to be not much different from that of T . The solar mixing\nangle is made order unity by having \u03c1 \u223c \u03c9 with about same vacuum expectation values.\nFurther mass relations at the Planck scale are in our model:\nVus = \u03b8c\nm3b\n\n\u0012\n\nmd\n\u2248 (\u03b8\u2299 )\nms\n\u2248 ms mc mt .\n\u2212 13\n\n\u00132\n3\n\n,\n\n(115)\n(116)\n\nConcerning the baryon number production it should be said that due to the much\nlarger CP violation, i.e., \u01eb2 and \u01eb3 , in the decay of the two heavier and almost degenerate\nsee-saw neutrinos than in the decay of the lightest one, it is the heavy neutrinos that\ndeliver the main/dominant contribution to the surviving (B \u2212 L) excess and thus to the\nbaryon number.\nThis of course means that it is important for our success that there were no inflation\nafter the era of the heavy pair of degenerate see-saw neutrinos to attenuate the B \u2212 L\nproduced and add re-heating entropy diminishing YB\u2212L (or YB ). It is also important for\nsuch success that we had already at this era roughly the number of see-saw neutrinos\ncorresponding to thermal equilibrium as we used in our calculation. That means that\ninflation eras should already have been recovered from at the time when the temperature\nreached down to 1010 GeV (see eqs. 96-98).\n\n11.2\n\nDevelopments in calculational method\n\nIt should be mentioned that we have made the present numerical calculations taking into\naccount the renormalisation group running effects of the Yukawa couplings as well as the\neffective dimension five operator corresponding to two Weinberg-Salam Higgses interacting\nwith two left-handed neutrinos giving the neutrino masses observed. Compared to our\nprevious work we included the running between the Planck scale and the see-saw scale of\nthe Dirac neutrino Yukawa couplings.\n\n11.3\n\nOn the accuracy\n\nAt first one might wonder if such runnings are needed when we at the end in principle\nget only order of magnitude predictions. However, they can give easily factors of three (or\nmore) and we really have managed to get agreeing results with accuracy corresponding\nto that the simple mass matrix elements are uncertain only by the theoretically expected\n32\n\n\f\u00b164% logarithmically, so indeed it is important to include corrections that could be of\nthe order of a factor two. It is quite remarkable that we are able to work/fit with this\ngood accuracy in a model that is in principle only order of magnitude. If it is not just\nbecause we had too many discrete details, i.e., quantum numbers of Higgs field, to adjust\nit should mean that there is indeed in nature couplings that are a priori of order unity in\na way that in praxis means that one can count on them being of that order to the rather\nhigh accuracy we achieved. With this our \u00b164% accuracy in mind we may remark that\nwe have in spite of working only \"with orders of magnitude\" gotten rather close to the\nexperimental uncertainties in the quantities which we fit: For the very light quarks up,\ndown and strange quarks one can get variations form one lattice computation to the other\none that can \"well\" reach our uncertainty and the neutrino parameters are typically also\nuncertain with such uncertainties.\nOf course one can still be more ambitious than we were in the present article and\nhope for understanding the well measured mass ratios of the charged leptons, but there is\nnot at all as much yet to fit as if the quarks and neutrons masses and mixings had been\nequally well measured and thus an order of magnitude fitting is at the present time using\nquite a significant bit of the data that can possibly help us to dig behind the Standard\nModel.\nAt the end let us admit that our ambitious model does not have any candidate in it for\ndark matter nor for the LSND neutrino anomaly. That would require totally new elements\nin our model, as for instance a hidden sector. Combining our model with Supersymmetry\nwould enforce us to double all the Higgs fields except W -Higgs field, and the model would\nloose much predictive power drastically.\n\nNote added\nDuring the completion of this article, the reference [47] appeared which treats also the \u03b2\nfunction for the Dirac neutrino Yukawa coupling. Our result (eq. 35) does not match with\ntheir result, with respect to the coefficient of weakhypercharge gauge coupling, because\nof the different notation: we used the GUT notation for g1 coupling constant.\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe wish to thank T.
