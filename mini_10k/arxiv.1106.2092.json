In this paper we add this constraint to the analysis of AzTEC\u20133. Adopting an upper\nlimit to the mass of stars and a bolometric luminosity for this object, we construct different stellar and\nchemical evolutionary scenarios, constrained to produce the inferred dust mass and observed luminosity before the associated stellar mass exceeds the observational limit. We use the P\u00c9GASE population\nsynthesis code and a chemical evolution model to follow the evolution of the galaxy's SED and its\nstellar and dust masses as a function of galactic age for seven different stellar initial mass functions\n(IMFs). We find that the model with a Top Heavy IMF provided the most plausible scenario consistent with the observational constraints. In this scenario the dust formed over a period of \u223c 200 Myr,\nwith a SFR of \u223c 500 M\u2299 yr\u22121 .

INTRODUCTION\n\nThe origin of the dust in ultraluminous high\nredshift galaxies with redshifts z & 4 is still unresolved, with supernovae (SNe), evolved AGB\nstars, the winds around active galactic nuclei\n(AGN), or growth in molecular clouds as possible\nsources (Elvis et al. 2002; Morgan & Edmunds 2003;\nMaiolino et al. 2004; Dwek et al. 2007; Valiante et al.\n2009; Dwek & Cherchneff 2011; Michalowski et al.\n2010a; Gall et al. 2011a,b).

An IR luminosity powered by\nluminous massive stars will suggest a high present SFR,\nfavoring a SN origin for the dust. An IR luminosity that\nis powered by an active galactic nucleus (AGN) suggests\na low present SFR and may favor the delayed injection\nof dust by AGB stars that may have formed during\nan earlier phase of much higher star formation activity\n(Valiante et al. 2009; Dwek & Cherchneff 2011).\nNo such ambiguity exists for AzTEC\u20133, an ultraluminous IR galaxy located at redshift z = 5.3, that was first\ndetected at submillimeter wavelengths by Scott et al.\n(2008). It is a radio-dim source (Younger et al. 2007)\nwith no X-ray counterpart (Capak et al. 2011), and part\nof a young cluster, representing an overdensity of early\nmassive galaxies at the same redshift (Capak et al. 2011).\nOptical to submillimeter observations summarized in\nCapak et al. (2011) show that the energy output is dominated by its far-infrared (IR) emission with luminosities\nbetween \u223c (0.6 \u2212 2) \u00d7 1013 L\u2299 . The lack of any radio or\nX-ray counterparts suggests that this luminosity is powered by a 1800 M\u2299 yr\u22121 starburst (Riechers et al. 2010;\nCapak et al. 2011). The total CO-inferred gas mass is\n\u223c 5 \u00d7 1010 M\u2299 , which will be depleted in less than\n\u223c 30 Myr at this SFR. Such energy output suggests\nthe presence of a large amount of dust, which had to\nbe created (at least) in less than \u223c 1.1 Gyr, the age of\n\n\f2\nthe universe at that redshift. AzTEC\u20133 therefore falls\nin the category of extreme starburst galaxies with large\ndust masses (& 108 M\u2299 ) described by Michalowski et al.\n(2010b) and Robson et al. (2004).\nIn this paper we present a new comprehensive approach\nfor studying the star formation properties and the origin\nof dust in AzTEC\u20133. The approach is quite general and\ncan be applied to any local or high-redshift galaxy. We\nfirst use the UV to far-IR SED of the galaxy to determine its bolometric luminosity and dust mass. Its SFR\ndepends on the adopted IMF, and we generate a series\nof models relating the bolometric luminosity to the stellar mass and galactic age for different stellar IMFs (Section 2). In Section 3 we use the observed UV-optical\n(UVO) spectrum, the UVNIR SED, and dynamical limits on the stellar mass to constrain the age of the galaxy\nfrom observations. We then generate different scenarios for the evolution of the dust, characterized by different IMFs, and examine which scenario is capable of\nproducing the inferred dust mass in AzTEC\u20133 within\nthe allowed age limit, that is, before the concurrent stellar mass production exceeds the stellar mass limit (Section 4). Our results are discussed and summarized in\nSection 5.\nIn all our calculations we adopt a flat \u039bCDM cosmology, with a baryonic density parameter \u03a9b = 0.044, a total matter (dark+baryonic) density parameter of \u03a9m =\n0.27, a vacuum energy density \u03a9\u039b = 0.73, and a Hubble constant of H0 = 70 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 (Spergel et al.\n2007).\n2.

The observed fluxes were taken from Capak et al. (2011). The\nfigure shows that the energy output from the galaxy is\ndominated by the stellar radiation that is absorbed and\nreradiated by dust at IR wavelengths. Observed IR flux\ndensities and their 1\u03c3 uncertainties are listed in Table 1.\nFigure 2 shows the far-IR galaxy's SED in its rest frame\n(left panel) and the observer's frame (right panel).

In order to determine\nthe uncertainties in the derived dust temperatures, dust\nmasses, and IR luminosities, we constructed 1000 realizations of the observed spectrum. The flux at each wavelength was randomly chosen from a normal distribution\ncentered around the nominal flux. The derived quantities\nfor the different dust compositions are listed in Table 2.\nThe Fe and graphite dust spectra are similar to that of\nthe silicate dust, and were left out of the figure for sake\nof clarity. Dust masses vary greatly from 0.3 \u00d7 109 M\u2299 ,\nif all the dust in AzTEC\u20133 is in the form of amorphous\ncarbon, to 3.2\u00d7109 M\u2299 , if it consists of only silicate dust.\nBecause of the skin effect, the absorptivity of metallic Fe\ndepends on the the grain radius, and the mass presented\nin the table was calculated for a radius of 0.33 \u03bcm for\nwhich the mass absorption coefficient, \u03ba, was maximum\nat the wavelength of 174.6 \u03bcm. This choice of \u03ba minimizes the mass of Fe dust required to fit the observed\nfluxes. Since AzTEC\u20133 is not likely to contain only pure\nFe, silicate, or carbon-type dust, any dust consisting of\na mixture of these elements will vary between between\nthese mass estimates.\nTo get a more realistic presentation of the mixture\nof dust compositions and size distribution in AzTEC\u20133\nwe also fitted its spectrum with that of two local starburst galaxies: M82, and Arp220, and a normal star\nforming galaxy NGC6946. The spectra of these galaxies were obtained by using population synthesis models to derive their stellar emission, chemical evolution\nmodels to derive their metallicity and dust composition,\nand radiative transfer models including the stochastic\nheating of dust to derive their IR spectrum and dust\nmass (Galliano et al. 2008). Transferred to a redshift\nof z = 5.3, the IR luminosities and dust masses for all\nthree galaxies were derived from their normalization factors, obtained from the least-squares fit of their spectra to the AzTEC\u20133 observations. The spectra depicted\nin the Figure represent the total IR emission from dust\nresiding in HII and photodissociation regions. Both\nstarburst galaxies, M82 and Arp220, provided a very\ngood fit to the data.

In contrast, the dust in\nNGC6946 is too cold, and its far-IR emission exceeds\nthe 3-\u03c3 upper limits on the underlying continuum of the\ndetected CO(J = 5 \u2192 4) and CO(J = 6 \u2192 5) lines\n(Riechers et al. 2010).

The intrinsic far-IR luminosity (top panel) and the\nobserved specific intensity (bottom panel) of AzTEC\u20133 are plotted as a function of the rest frame and observed wavelengths, respectively. Also plotted are template spectra of local galaxies and\nsingle-temperature fits of dust grains of different compositions to\nthe observed spectrum. Data and references are given in Table 1.\n\nFor sake of being definitive we adopt throughout this\npaper a dust mass, Mdust , of 2.0 \u00b1 1.0 \u00d7 109 M\u2299 , representing the average value between M82 and Arp220.\nOur choice of average dust mass derived from these template galaxies is more realistic than any choice based on\nthe assumption that all the IR emission is produced by\na single dust specie. The average IR luminosity of these\ntwo galaxies is 1.0 \u00d7 1013 L\u2299 and since the bolometric\nluminosity of AzTEC\u20133 is dominated by the IR emission\ncomponent we adopt a bolometric luminosity, Lbol , that\nis equal to 1.0 \u00d7 1013 L\u2299 .\n\nThe far-IR luminosity provides a good measure of the\nstar formation activities in galaxies (Kennicutt 1998).\nIn a galaxy with ongoing star formation the bolometric\nluminosity and stellar mass increase with time because\nof the cumulative contribution from long-lived low-mass\nstars. Derived star formation rates depend therefore on\nthe assumed star formation history of the galaxy. Furthermore, the relation between the luminosity and star\nformation rate depends on the adopted stellar IMF. Massive stars radiate much more efficiently than low mass\nones (L \u221d M 3.3 , in solar units) so that an IMF weighted\nmore heavily towards massive stars will require a lower\nSFR for a given observed luminosity. To explore the dependence of the SFR on the stellar IMF, we used seven\ndifferent functional forms to characterize the latter. The\nparameters characterizing the IMFs are given in Table 3,\nand Figure 3 depicts the functional form of 4 select IMFs.\nTable 3 also includes two characteristic values of the different IMFs: hmi, which is the IMF-averaged mass, and\nm\u22c6 , which is the mass of stars that need to be formed to\nproduce one Type II SN event. With these definitions,\nthe stellar birthrate (yr\u22121 ) is given by SFR/hmi, and the\nSN rate by SFR/m\u22c6 .\nTo determine the SFR and the mass of stellar objects as\na function of galactic age we ran the P\u00c9GASE population\nsynthesis code developed by Fioc & Rocca-Volmerange\n(1997) for the seven different stellar IMFs, listed in Table 3, for a constant SFR of 1 M\u2299 yr\u22121 . Table 4 list the\ncorresponding bolometric luminosities and stellar masses\nat different galactic ages. For example, for the adopted\nLbol = 1\u00d71013 L\u2299 , the table shows that for a Glazebrook\nIMF the SFR is \u223c 735 M\u2299 yr\u22121 and the total mass of\nstars is \u223c 5.6 \u00d7 1010 M\u2299 when the galaxy reaches an\nage of 100 Myr. At the same age, a starburst IMF will\nrequire a SFR of only \u223c 270 M\u2299 yr\u22121 to produce the\nsame luminosity, and will have created \u223c 7.5 \u00d7 109 M\u2299\nof stars. Figure 4 depicts these results in graphic form,\nshowing the constant SFR required to produce a bolometric luminosity of 1 \u00d7 1013 L\u2299 at a given age for 4\ndifferent IMFs. The bold section in each line depicts the\nallowed range of galaxy ages before the model violates\nthe constraint on the stellar mass, a topic discussed in\ndetail in Section 3.3 below. We emphasize that this figure\ndoes not represent the evolution of the SFR with time.\nFor each stellar IMF, it depicts the value of the con-\n\n\f4\nTable 3\nCharacteristics of the Stellar IMFs1\nIMF\n\n\u03b11\n\n\u03b12\n\n\u03b13\n\nM1\n\nM2\n\nM3\n\nM4\n\nhmi2\n\nm\u22c6 3\n\nGlazebrook\nKroupa\nMass Heavy\nPaunchy\nSalpeter\nStarburst\nTop Heavy\n\n1.5\n1.3\n2.35\n1.0\n2.35\n2.35\n1.95\n\n2.15\n2.3\n***\n1.7\n***\n***\n***\n\n***\n***\n***\n2.6\n***\n***\n***\n\n0.1\n0.1\n1.0\n0.1\n0.1\n5.0\n0.1\n\n0.5\n0.5\n100\n0.5\n100\n100\n100\n\n100\n100\n***\n4\n***\n***\n***\n\n***\n***\n***\n100\n***\n***\n***\n\n0.72\n0.64\n3.1\n1.1\n0.35\n12.8\n0.78\n\n70.0\n89.6\n52.7\n66.4\n134.7\n24.4\n55.4\n\n1\n\nAll masses are in M\u2299 .

Spectral Constraints on the Age\nThe preceding section illustrated the importance of\nknowing the galactic age for determining the star formation, and the stellar and elemental enrichment histories of a galaxy. The UVO spectrum can contain important information for determining this age. Figure 1 in\nCapak et al. (2011) presents the full resolution spectrum\nof AzTEC\u20133, obtained with the Keck II telescope. The\nspectrum shows Si II and C IV stellar absorption features\nwhich are indicative of the presence of a population of\nyoung O and B stars. In a single burst of star formation\nthe spectral contribution from young stars should diminish with time. The presence of these features therefore\nled them to the conclusion that AzTEC\u20133 should be less\nthan \u223c 30 Myr old. However, in an ongoing star formation scenario, the stellar population will always contain young O and B stars, and their spectral features\nwill only fade at much later times as they are gradually\n\n\f5\noverwhelmed by the featureless continuum from the less\nmassive stars.\n\ndoes not evolve significantly because even a very small\nnumber of O/B stars will dominate the UV emission.\nThe AzTEC\u20133 spectrum shows some of the same stellar absorption features present in the synthetic spectra,\nbut contains in addition features caused by interstellar\nabsorption, a process that is not included in the Starburst99 models. The right panel of the figure shows the\ncorrelation between the observed spectrum and that of\none of the models. Except for a constant offset caused\nby the evolution of the total intensity of the spectrum,\nthe correlation plot is identical for all models.\nThe similarity of the AzTEC\u20133 spectrum to the model\nspectra, and the fact that the model spectra are essentially identical even though they represent different\nepochs and were generated with different IMFs, shows\nthat the observed \u223c 1200 \u2212 1600 \u00c5 spectrum cannot be\nused to constrain the age of the galaxy when star formation is an ongoing process.\n3.2. SED Contraints on the Age: The Age Degeneracy\n\nFigure 5. Top panel: The observed Keck II spectrum of\nAzTEC\u20133 (Capak et al. 2011) is compared to high-resolution UV\nspectra generated by Starburst99. The observed spectrum has\nbeen redshifted by z = 5.3 and rebinned to the 0.75 \u00c5 resolution of the model spectra. Model spectra were calculated assuming ongoing constant star formation rates, and are depicted for\ntwo stellar IMFs: Salpeter (Sp) and Top-Heavy (TH). To facilitate\nthe comparison between the models and observations the spectra\nwere normalized and shifted with respect to each other. The figure\nalso depicts the location of important stellar lines. The observed\nAzTEC\u20133 spectrum is more complex since it also contains interstellar absorption lines. The main point of this panel is to illustrate\nthat the observed spectrum cannot be used as an effective determinator of the age of AzTEC\u20133. Bottom panel: The correlation\nbetween the observed and the model spectrum. The colored line\ndepicts the best fit line to the correlation. The synthetic spectra\nare essentially identical for all models depicted in the figure (except for a scaling factor), yielding an identical degree of correlation\nbetween the models and observations, regardless of the age of the\nsystem.\n\nTo examine if the observed spectrum can be used to\ndetermine the age of the galaxy we constructed synthetic\nUV spectra for constant star formation scenarios and different stellar IMFs (TH=Top Heavy; Sp=Salpeter) using\nStarburst99 (Leitherer et al. 1999; V\u00e1zquez & Leitherer\n2005; Leitherer et al. 2010). Figure 5 compares the synthetic spectra with the observed one. The figure shows\nthat the TH model spectra have not evolved significantly\nin shape between the ages of 30 and 200 Myr. Their total\nintensity has, of course evolved, an effect not shown in\nthe figure because of the offset. They are also identical\nto the Sp model at 30 Myr. The simulations show that\nwhen star formation is an ongoing process, the spectrum\n\nThe UVNIR SED of a galaxy can provide independent\nconstraints on its age. Using the results of the previous\nsection we created a library of intrinsic stellar SEDs for\nthe seven IMFs and for a grid of galaxy ages, ranging up\nto to 800 Myr. The results are shown in Figures 6 and 7\nfor 4 select IMFs and for ages between 10 and 400 Myr.\nEach panel in the figure presents the intrinsic SED (black\nline) generated by a distinct evolutionary sequence that is\nterminated at the assumed galactic age presented in the\npanel. Each evolutionary sequence is characterized by a\nconstant SFR which is distinct from other sequences and\ndetermined by the stellar IMF and the galactic age for\nthe adopted bolometric luminosity of 1 \u00d7 1013 L\u2299 (see\nTable 4 and Figure 4). So the Salpeter 20 Myr panel\nrepresents the SED of a galaxy that underwent a constant SFR of \u223c 1900 M\u2299 yr\u22121 for that length of time.\nIn each panel, the intrinsic SED is clearly in excess of\nthe observed stellar flux (red diamonds), which has been\nsignificantly attenuated by dust. Lacking a definitive\ndust model for the IR emission, we used the Calzetti law\n(Calzetti et al. 2000) to characterize the extinction. For\neach evolutionary sequence we calculated the visual optical depth, \u03c4 (V ), that provided the best least-squares fit\nto the observations. Values of \u03c4 (V ) ranged from \u223c 2 \u2212 4.\nThe attenuated stellar spectra are presented by violet\nlines in the figures.\nFigure 8 depicts the minimum \u03c72 of the fit of the attenuated spectra to the data as a function of galaxy age and\nstellar IMF. The figure shows that for each IMF there exists an age degeneracy for which the value of \u03c72 is essentially unchanged. This degeneracy is caused by the fact\nthat the galaxy's SED changes very little with time for\nthe first \u223c 100 Myr. The small changes that do occur\nare compensated for with small changes in the magnitude of the attenuation. This effect is exhibited in both\nthe figures of the SEDs and that depicting the value \u03c72\nwith galactic age. For example, Figure 8 shows that the\nSalpeter and Glazebrook IMFs provide equally good fits\nto the observed UVNIR SED for ages up to \u223c 100 Myr,\nand the Top Heavy IMF for ages up to \u223c 200 Myr. The\nfits become significantly worse thereafter, an effect that\nis also clearly seen in Figures 6 and 7. The Starburst IMF\nprovides an equally good fit to the observed spectrum at\nall epochs. Better fits to the observed spectra at later\n\n\f6\n\nFigure 6. Intrinsic (black curve) and attenuated (violet curve) stellar SEDs are plotted for an adopted Lbol = 1 \u00d7 1013 L\u2299 , and\nfor 2 different IMFs (Salpeter and Glazebrook) and 6 different galactic ages. Each panel represents a distinct evolutionary scenario,\ncharacterized by a constant SFR determined by the requirement that the intrinsic bolometric luminosity be equal to the adopted observed\nvalue of 1 \u00d7 1013 L\u2299 at the designated galactic age (see Figure 4). The value of AV that provided the best fit of the attenuated spectrum\nto the observed UVNIR fluxes (red diamonds) is given in the figure.\n\n\f7\n\nFigure 7. Same as Figure 6 for the Top Heavy and Starburst IMFs.\n\n\f8\n\nFigure 8. The value of \u03c72 for the fit of the attenuated SEDs to the\nUVNIR observations for 4 different IMFs as a function of galactic\nage. The figure shows that for each IMF the best fitting SED is not\nsensitive to age. For ages less than \u223c 100 Myr, the small changes\nin the intrinsic SED are compensated for by small changes in the\namount of dust attenuation. The galaxy's SED provides only a\nweak limit on the age. The starburst IMF produces equally good\nfits to the observed SED for all galactic ages.\n\nepochs can probably be obtained if we adopted a different extinction law, or a time-dependent extinction law\nthat reflects the changing dust composition with time.\nSuch changes would need to be consistent with the farIR emission as well. Such detailed investigation into the\nextinction law (i.e. optical properties of the dust, and\nthe physical distribution of the dust with respect to the\nradiation sources) is currently beyond the scope of this\npaper.\n3.3. Stellar Mass Constraints of the Age: A Partial\n\nLifting of the Degeneracy.\nThe ambiguity in stellar age can be partially lifted by\nconsidering the upper limits on the stellar mass in the\ngalaxy. Capak et al. (2011) derived a stellar mass of\n\u223c 1010 M\u2299 , using the Maraston library of stellar SEDs\n(Maraston 2005) and a galactic age of \u223c 30 Myr. This\nage was inferred from the Keck II spectrum, assuming\nthat all the star formation occurred in a single burst.\nSince we have shown that the UV spectrum cannot constrain the age of AzTEC\u20133, we prefer to use a weaker,\nbut observationally determined, constraint on the stellar\nmass. Using kinematic CO data and limits on the angular size of the galaxy, Riechers et al. (2010) derived the\nvalues of Mgas , the mass of the gas (dominated by the\nmolecular component), and Mdyn , the dynamical mass\nof the galaxy. The dynamical mass is given by Mdyn \u2243\nMgas + Mstars + MDM , where Mstars and MDM are, respectively, the mass in stars and dark matter. The dynamical mass offers therefore a strict upper limit on the\nstellar mass. Adopting a gas fraction (\u2261 Mgas /Mdyn )\nof 0.5 (Riechers et al. 2010), we adopt an upper limit of\nMstars \u2243 Mgas \u2243 5 \u00d7 1010 M\u2299 on the stellar mass of the\ngalaxy.\nSince the mass of stars builds up at different rates for\nthe different IMFs, this upper limit can provide useful\nconstraints on the age of the galaxy. This effect is shown\n\nFigure 9. The stellar mass as a function of the assumed duration\nof the star formation activity in AzTEC3 for four different IMFs.\nThe dashed horizontal line corresponds to the upper limit on the\nstellar mass in the galaxy derived from estimates of the dynamical\nand gas masses of the galaxy (Riechers et al. 2010). For each IMF,\nthe bold colored line depicts the allowed range of galaxy ages before\nthe model violates the constraint on the stellar mass.\n\nin Figure 9, which depicts the derived mass of stars as\na function of the assumed age of AzTEC\u20133 for different\nstellar IMFs. Each symbol represents a distinct evolutionary sequence in which the SFR proceeded at a constant rate determined by the assumed galactic age and\nstellar IMF (see Figure 4). The Salpeter IMF requires\nthe largest SFR, and is therefore the first to exceed this\nmass limit after tage (max) \u223c 30 Myr. The Glazebrook\nIMF exceeds this mass limit after \u223c 80 Myr, and the Top\nHeavy IMF after \u223c 200 Myr. The Starburst IMF is the\nmost efficient one in producing the observed bolometric\nluminosity with a low SFR, and does not have a large\npopulation of low mass stars. Consequently, it does not\nexceed the adopted stellar mass limit within \u223c 1 Gyr,\nthe approximate age of the universe at that redshift.\n4. DUST EVOLUTION: A NEW CONSTRAINT\nON GALACTIC PROPERTIES\n\nThe presence of (2 \u00b1 1) \u00d7 109 M\u2299 of dust provides\nnew additional constraints on the star formation rate\nand history of AzTEC\u20133. To demonstrate this effect we used the chemical evolution model described in\nDwek & Cherchneff (2011) to follow the evolution of the\ndust for the four different astrophysical scenarios determined by the stellar IMFs and the upper limit of the mass\nof stars in the galaxy. For each IMF we adopted a galactic age, tage (max), taken to be equal to the last epoch before the mass of stars produced by the model violates the\nstellar mass limit. The ages are \u223c 30, 80, and 200 Myr\nfor the Salpeter, Glazebrook, and Top Heavy IMFs, respectively (see Fig. 9). For the Starburst IMF we chose,\nquite arbitrary, a value of tage (max) = 800 Myr. The\nmodels then assume that star formation proceeds at a\nconstant rate of \u223c 1800, 700, 500, and 300 M\u2299 yr\u22121 ,\nrepectively (see Fig. 4).\nWe used a closed box model to follow the chemical evolution of AzTEC\u20133. The initial gas mass was chosen so\nthat each model reproduced the inferred gas mass of \u223c\n5\u00d71010 M\u2299 at age t =tage (max). The chemical evolution\n\n\f9\n\nFigure 10. The evolution of the dust and gas mass in AzTEC\u20133 are plotted as a function of time for the models characterized by their\ndifferent IMFs. Total dust masses (blue curves) represent the sum of the dust masses produced by SNe and AGB stars. The contribution\nof AGB stars is depicted by red lines. Total and AGB dust masses are plotted for two cases: upper curves ignore the effects of grain\ndestruction, whereas the lower curves adopt a Milky Way destruction efficiency. The bold section of each curve depicts the evolution over\nthe time span allowed before the galaxy violates the upper limit on the stellar mass (see Fig. 9). The shaded region depicts the adopted\ndust mass limits inferred from the far-IR observations.\n\nmodel follows the changes in metallicities over timescales\nthat are comparable to the main sequence lifetimes of the\nmassive SN progenitors. Consequently, in addition to the\ndelayed recycling of matter by long-lived AGB stars, the\nmodel also includes the delayed recycling of matter by\nmassive stars. AGB yields for stars with masses below\n8 M\u2299 were taken from Karakas & Lattanzio (2007) for\na metallicity of Z = 0.008. SN dust yields of massive\nstars were taken as an average between the zero and solar\nmetallicity yields given by Heger & Woosley (2010) and\nWoosley & Heger (2007), respectively (see Table 5 for select stellar masses). Dust condensation efficiencies were\nchosen to be unity for AGB stars, and 0.5 for Type II\nSNe.\nThe results of our model calculations are shown in Figure 10. The green curve depicts the evolution of the gas\nmass which plummets when the constant SFR depletes\nall the gas (and dust) into stars. The blue curves depict\nthe evolution of the total dust mass, which is the sum\nof the contribution from SNe and AGB stars. The AGB\ncontribution is a small fraction of the total dust mass,\nand is shown separately by red curves. Models were run\nfor two cases: the first ignores the effect of grain destruction, and is depicted by the solid blue curves; and the\nsecond takes the effect of grain destruction into account\nand is depicted by the dashed blue curves. The grain\n\ndestruction rate was calculated by integrating the mass\nof dust destroyed as a function of shock velocity (Jones\n2004), over the evolution of a supernova remnant. The\nmass of dust destroyed by a single SN remnant during its\nlifetime is about mdest \u2248 3 M\u2299 (Dwek et al. 2007) and\nthe grain destruction rate is given by SF R \u00d7 mdest /m\u22c6 .\nThe bold section of each curve depicts the evolution over\nthe time span allowed before the galaxy violates the upper limit on the stellar mass (see Fig. 9). The shaded\nregion depicts the range of dust masses inferred from the\nfar-IR observations.\nThe figure shows that when grain destruction is taken\ninto account, none of the models is capable of producing the required dust mass at any time. With no grain\ndestruction, all models depicted in the figure are capable of producing the required dust mass, albeit at different quantities. These idealized models can be considered\nas representatives of models in which rapid accretion in\nmolecular clouds compensates for the mass of dust that\nis destroyed in the ISM. So the models show that rapid\ngrain growth in clouds is an essential process for producing the inferred dust mass in AzTEC\u20133.\nThe model that is clearly most capable of producing\nthe inferred dust mass is the one with the Top Heavy\nIMF. At the age of 200 Myr it produces more than the\ninferred upper range of the dust mass, thus allowing for\n\n\f10\nConsider a population of massive Pop III stars all of\nidentical mass m, and let Lbol be the total bolometric\noutput of this stellar population. To maintain a steady\nabundance of such stars, they have to be created at a\nrate given by:\n\u0015\n\u0014\nLbol\ndN\n\u22121\n\u00d7 \u03c4MS\n,\n(2)\n=\ndt\nLedd\nwhere \u03c4MS , their main sequence lifetime, is determined\nby the time it takes to radiate all the energy released\nin the production of helium and heavy elements at the\nEddington luminosity. It is independent of stellar mass,\nand given by:\n\u03c4MS = 0.007mc2/Ledd \u2248 3 \u00d7 106 yr.\nFigure 11. The intrinsic UV to far-IR luminosity from AzTEC\u20133\n(grey line) calculated with the P\u00c9GASE stellar population code is\nplotted as a function of the rest frame wavelength, \u03bb0 . The two\ngalactic templates of M82 and Arp220 represent two possible fits to\nthe far-IR spectrum of AzTEC3. The intrinsic stellar luminosity of\n1013 L\u2299 falls between that of the two galactic templates (see Table 2). The black curve represent the attenuated starlight derived\nwith the Calzetti extinction curve for a value of A(V ) = 2.30.\n\na modest amount of grain destruction. It therefore does\nnot require that the accretion in molecular clouds reconstitute all the dust that was destroyed in the more diffuse\nISM. The Starburst model is just capable of producing\nthe lower range of inferred dust mass at t = 400 Myr,\nand requires that all the refractory elements returned by\ngrain processing into the gas are quickly reaccreted onto\nsurviving grains in molecular clouds. The models with\na Salpeter or Glazebrook IMF fall in between these two\nmodels.\nFigure 11 depicts the spectrum produced by stars\ngenerated by the most plausible scenario that satisfies\nboth the stellar mass and the dust mass constraints of\nAzTEC\u20133: a galaxy with a Top Heavy IMF undergoing a\nconstant SFR at a rate of 300 M\u2299 yr\u22121 over a timespan\nof 200 Myr, and allowing for over half of its dust to be\ndestroyed. The stellar SED is attenuated by a Calzetti\nextinction law with \u03c4 (V ) = 2.3. The intrinsic stellar\nspectrum is shown as the gray curve, and has a luminosity of 1 \u00d7 1013 L\u2299 , which lies between the luminosity\nof the two galactic templates, M82 and Arp 220 (see Table 2). This scenario is not unique, but the most plausible\none among the models. A Top Heavy IMF was also the\npreferred scenario for the rapid and efficient production\nof dust in the early universe by Gall et al. (2011a) and\nDunne et al. (2010).\n5. A POPULATION III ORIGIN FOR THE DUST?\n\nPopulation III (Pop III) stars, the first population\nof stars being born out of a pristine, zero metallicity gas, may also be important contributors to the\ndust in these young galaxies (Nozawa et al. 2003, 2009;\nTodini & Ferrara 2001; Cherchneff & Dwek 2010). They\nare believed to be massive (Bromm & Larson 2004), and\nsupported by radiation pressure at the Eddington luminosity:\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\nm\nLedd\n= 3 \u00d7 104\n.\n(1)\nL\u2299\nM\u2299\n\n(3)\n\nThe SFR needed to maintain the observed luminosity is\nindependent of the stellar mass and given by SF R =\nm (dN/dt) \u2248 10\u221212 \u00d7 Lbol M\u2299 yr\u22121 . The rate of dust\nproduction is given by:\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\ndMdust\ndN\nYdust\nLbol\n=\n(4)\n= Ydust\ndt\ndt\n\u03c4MS\nLedd\nwhere Ydust is the amount of dust produced in these objects.\nDust formation in massive Pop III stars has only\nbeen calculated for 170 M\u2299 stars (Nozawa et al. 2003;\nCherchneff & Dwek 2010). Such a Pop III star will have\na luminosity of \u223c 5 \u00d7 106 L\u2299 . The dust yield depends\non the whether the ejecta maintains its stratified compositional structure or becomes completely mixed, and\nranges from \u223c 7 to \u223c 35 M\u2299 , for unmixed and fully\nmixed ejecta, respectively. The total mass of dust produced at time t, assuming no grain destruction, is given\nby:\n\u0013\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012\nt\nMdust\n(5)\n\u2248 (5 \u2212 25) \u00d7\nM\u2299\nyr\nwhere the range of ages reflects the uncertainty in the\ndust yield of such stars. The time needed to create an\naverage Mdust = 2 \u00d7 109 M\u2299 of dust by 170 M\u2299 Pop III\nstars is therefore \u223c 100 \u2212 400 Myr. This timescale is significantly longer than their main sequence lifetime, and\ntoo long to maintain a pristine reservoir of gas to feed\nthe formation of metal-free stars. We therefore conclude\nthat the massive amount of dust seen in AzTEC\u20133 cannot have been produced by a burst of Pop III stars that\nare currently giving rise to the observed far-IR luminosity of the galaxy.\n6. DISCUSSION\n\nDeriving the physical properties of high redshift galaxies from their spectra is an important goal for understanding their origin and evolution. In the absence of\nperfect and complete information, these derived physical\nproperties are not unique, allowing for different evolutionary scenarios to explain the observations.\nIn this paper we explore a new method that can,\nin principle, discriminate between different evolutionary\nscenarios. The method requires that the mass of dust\ninferred from the far-IR emission to be present in these\ngalaxies be produced within an allotted time span imposed by other observations. We applied our method to\n\n\f11\nTable 5\nYields of Condensible Elements and Maximum Dust\nMasses in Massive Stars1\nElement/\nMetallicity\n12 C\n16 O\n24 Mg\n28 Si\n56 Fe\n\nCarbon dust\nSilicate dust2\nIron dust\nTotal dust3\n\n20 M\u2299\nZ = 0 Z = Z\u2299\n0.21\n1.34\n0.065\n0.0025\n\u223c0\n0.21\n0.11\n0.0\n0.32\n\n0.23\n1.38\n0.065\n0.19\n0.12\n0.23\n0.52\n0.12\n0.87\n\n50 M\u2299\nZ = 0 Z = Z\u2299\n1.86\n11.2\n0.31\n0.27\n0.41\n1.86\n1.10\n0.41\n3.4\n\n1.61\n9.7\n0.33\n0.21\n0.28\n1.61\n1.00\n0.28\n2.9\n\n1\n\nZero metallicity yields were calculated for models with\nno mixing and with explosion energies of 1.2 \u00d7 1051 erg\nand 5 \u00d7 1051 erg, for the 20 and 50 M\u2299 stars, respectively\n(Heger & Woosley 2010); Z\u2299 metallicity yields were taken\nfrom Woosley & Heger (2007).

The basic observations available to constrain\nthe models are the high-resolution UV-optical spectrum,\nthe UV to millimeter SED, and the CO transitions that\nwere detected from this object.\nA fundamental observed quantity is the bolometric luminosity of the galaxy which in AzTEC\u20133 is dominated\nby the far-IR emission, and can be used to infer the SFR\nof the galaxy. However, converting Lbol to a SFR requires\nknowledge of the stellar IMF and the age of the galaxy,\nsince for a constant SFR and given IMF, the bolometric\nluminosity increases with time because of the contribution of long-lived low mass stars to the emission.\nThe IR region of the spectrum can be used to derive the\nmass of dust giving rise to the emission. The dust mass\ndepends on the dust composition and the dust temperature distribution, both unknown quantities. Estimates of\nthe dust mass can be derived for pure dust compositions\n(graphite, amorphous carbon, or silicates), based on dust\nmodels for the Milky Way. Alternatively, the dust mass\ncan also be estimated by fitting the observed SED with\nthat of known galaxies for which the dust mass has been\nderived from detailed models.\nThe CO emission spectrum can be used to derive the\ndynamical mass of the galaxy and the mass of molecular\ngas. Both quantities are uncertain. The dynamical mass\nestimate depends on the basic premise that the system\nhas relaxed to a Keplerian disk, and the determination\nof the gas mass depends on the uncertain X-factor that\nconverts the CO line intensity to an H2 mass. Without any further assumptions, only an upper limit can be\nobtained for the stellar mass in this galaxy.\nThe high-resolution UV spectrum can be used to determine the age of the system. Massive young stars exhibit\ncharacteristic P-Cygni profiles. The presence of these\nfeatures in the spectrum can therefore be used to determine the age of the system. For an instantaneous burst\nof star formation, these features disappear as these massive stars die off within \u223c 30 Myr. So their presence can\nbe used to estimate the age. When star formation is a\n\ncontinuous process, the massive stars are always present,\nand the strengths of the features relative to the continuum changes then much more gradually. Therefore, the\nage inferred from such spectrum will be much longer than\nthat inferred for an instantaneous burst. From our simulations, assuming a constant SFR, we find that the UV\nspectrum cannot discriminate between systems that are\nbetween \u223c 30 to 400 Myr old, the relevant age limits for\nAzTEC\u20133.\nThe bolometric luminosity of AzTEC\u20133 lies between\n0.6 to 2\u00d71013 L\u2299 , and to be definitive we adopted a value\nof Lbol = 1 \u00d7 1013 L\u2299 . For the dust mass we adopted a\nvalue of 2 \u00b1 1 \u00d7 109 M\u2299 . We adopted a very conservative\nupper limit of 5 \u00d7 1010 M\u2299 on the stellar mass, based on\nthe estimated dynamical and gas mass from this object.\nUsing these basic constraints, Lbol , Mdust , and Mstars ,\nwe constructed models to follow the evolution of the\ngalaxy's SED, stellar, and dust content as a function\nof time for 7 different stellar IMFs. Viable models were\nthose that were able to produce the inferred mass of dust\nbefore the concurrently produced mass in stars exceeded\nthe mass limit. The results of these models are depicted\nin Figure 10, and described in Section 4.\nThe results of the paper can be briefly summarized as\nfollows:\n1. Most of the dust giving rise to the far-IR emission from AzTEC\u20133 must have been grown in\nmolecular clouds. In the Milky Way, the need\nfor grain growth in molecular clouds to explain\nthe abundance of dust was first pointed out\nby Dwek & Scalo (1980), and more recently by\nZhukovska et al. (2008) and Jones & Nuth (2011).\nMichalowski et al. (2010a) argued that growth in\nmolecular clouds is the main source of dust in highredshift (5 < z < 6.5) quasars. In this paper we\nhave extended this point to the ultraluminous starburst AzTEC\u20133 using detailed chemical evolution\nmodels.\n2. There is a correlation between grain destruction\n\n\f12\nand the required growth in molecular clouds. At\nthe peak of its dust production, which occurs at\n\u223c 200 Myr, the Top Heavy model can form the inferred dust mass in AzTEC\u20133 without resorting to\ngrain growth in the ISM, but with a significantly\nreduced (compared to the Milky Way) efficiency of\ngrain destruction. At earlier epochs grain growth\nin molecular clouds must account for a significantly\nlarger fraction of the dust mass. In the Starburst\nmodel any grain destruction must be rapidly balanced by accretion in the ISM. The Salpeter and\nGalzebrook IMFs are less efficient in producing\ndust than the Top Heavy one. They can afford\nonly little grain destruction, and therefore require\na large fraction of their dust to be of interstellar\norigin.\n3. The model with the Top Heavy IMF is the most efficient one for producing the dust in AzTEC\u20133, and\ntherefore the more favorable model for the origin of\nthe dust in this galaxy. Taking the galaxy's age to\nbe 200 Myr, the longest time allowed by the stellar mass constraint, the constant SFR required to\nprovide the observed bolometric luminosity and the\nrequired dust mass is \u223c 500 M\u2299 yr\u22121 . The inferred\nconstant SFR is significantly smaller and the age\nis significantly longer than the previous estimates\nof \u223c 1800 M\u2299 yr\u22121 and \u223c 30 Myr, respectively,\nassuming a single burst of star formation.\n4. The Top Heavy model is, however, not unique. A\nclear discrimination between the different models\nrequires a significant reduction in the uncertainties\nof the measured quantities. For example, a better\ndetermination of the stellar mass may have resulted\nin a lower value than the upper limit adopted in this\npaper, ruling out the models using the Salpeter or\nthe Glazebrook functions to characterize the stellar\nIMF.\n5. Finally, Population III stars could not have produced both the currently observed luminosity and\ndust mass in AzTEC\u20133.\nThe studies presented here illustrate the power of multiwavelength observations and the simultaneous use of\nspectral, stellar, and dust mass constraints for determining the properties of high-redshift galaxies. Our studies\nalso highlight the need for more observational data and\nimproved model input parameters.\nAcknowledgements ED acknowledges helpful discussions with Dominik Riechers.
