INTRODUCTION\n\nThe rapid development of nanotechnology and the shrinking size of the functional elements of\ndevices demand diverse tools for comprehensive materials characterization at the micron and sub-micron\nlength scales. Near-field microwave microscopy has become a useful tool for imaging and measurement of\nelectromagnetic properties of materials at the micron length scale.1-6 Generally, the measurement principle\nof a microwave near-field microscope is based on alteration of the probe electrical impedance due to the\npresence of a sample in close proximity to the probe. To increase the microscope sensitivity, the probe is\noften made an integral part of a resonator \u2013 either distributed or based on lumped elements. Usually, due to\nfundamental limitations of a specific resonator design, the measurement frequency is limited to just one\nfrequency or to a small frequency range. Little work has been done on broadband microwave microscopy.\nChang at al.7 performed measurements of permittivity on thin film Ba1-xSrxTiO3 (BSTO) phase spreads in a\nfrequency range from 0.95 GHz to 4.95 GHz with the goal to investigate the compositional dependence of\nthe BSTO permittivity dispersion. However, in addition to the frequency-dependent properties of materials,\nbroadband measurements can also be implemented to separate and study the contributions of different\nsample properties in the measured microscope response. For instance, a broadband measurement can be\nused to disentangle dielectric permittivity and conductivity for a \"leaky\" dielectric, as well as to separate\nthe influence of parasitic factors and systematic uncertainties accompanying, e. g., varying probe-sample\ncoupling. Such an approach, called impedance spectroscopy, utilizing frequency sweeps is routinely used to\nstudy material properties at low frequencies with the use of LCR meters and impedance analyzers (see, e.g.,\nRefs. 8,9). One needs to cover at least one decade of frequency to obtain a reliable result of fitting to\naccomplish this task. Ideally, a microscope should acquire the full capability of an impedance analyzer\nwhile maintaining the ability to make spatially-resolved measurements.\nIn this respect, the microwave microscopes based on transmission line resonators have an\nadvantage over microscopes based on cavity or lumped element resonators since the resonance mode\nstructure in a transmission line resonator is maintained over a significantly broader frequency range, and the\nfrequency sweep can be realized simply by jumping from one resonance mode to another. An electrically\n\n2\n\n\flong transmission line resonator allows for a dense set of modes, creating a quasi-continuous frequency\ncoverage.\nFigure 1(a) shows the most general electrical schematic diagram of a transmission line resonator:\nthe resonator \u2013 a segment of a transmission line of length L \u2013 is coupled to a feed line with a coupling\nelement of impedance Zc and terminated by a probe with effective impedance Zt. Further, without\nsignificant loss of generality, we consider in more detail an example of a microscope with an electric probe\nbased on a coaxial line resonator. Figure 1(b) displays, for this particular case, a schematic of the resonator\nopen end with a small-radius apex tip acting as a probe in contact with a sample. Figure 1(c) shows a\nlumped element circuit representation of the probe tip and a lossy dielectric sample. Such a sample can be\ndescribed by an RC-pair.10,11 The capacitor, Cs, describes the fringe electric field energy stored in the\nsample, and the resistor, Rs, stands for all channels of energy dissipation in the sample. The sample is\ncoupled to the resonator through the tip-sample coupling capacitance Csc and the resistance of the tip Rtip.\nThe field between the tip and the outer conductor, which bypasses the sample, is represented by the\nparasitic stray capacitance Cstr. The effective probe tip impedance Zt can be calculated as the impedance of\nthe whole RC-network. The values of the equivalent circuit elements depend on the local properties of the\nsample under the probe tip and the set of parameters describing the tip-sample system. Generally, the\ndependence of the probe tip impedance on sample properties and the probe tip geometry is complicated and\nits elucidation constitutes the major problem of microwave microscopy.2,6,12-16 A more detailed description\nof a sample will require a more complicated equivalent circuit.\nWhen the tip is being scanned over the sample, the variation of the effective tip impedance causes\nshifts \u2206f of the resonant frequencies and changes of the Q-factors of the resonator modes, which are\nmonitored and imaged by a computer. Ideally, the broadband measurements could be accomplished by\nswitching from one resonant frequency to another while the probe-sample geometry is fixed. By subsequent\nfitting of the microscope frequency-dependent response to a specific electrical model of the probe-sample\nsystem, the set of model parameters could be deduced, and further, the contributions of local properties of\nthe sample could be separated and determined.\n\n3\n\n\fIn this paper, we present an experimental effort of broadband imaging of a Focused Ion Beam (FIB)\nmilled structure on a Ba0.6Sr0.4TiO3 (BSTO) thin film, covering a frequency range from 1.3 GHz to\n17.4 GHz with ~1 \u03bcm spatial resolution. Using a microscope system based on a coaxial transmission line\nresonator, we explore the possibility of distinguishing contributions of the film permittivity and the film\nconductance, particularly through the resonant frequency shift, by implementing broadband imaging.\n\nII. EXPERIMENT\n\nA 370 nm-thick Ba0.6Sr0.4TiO3 film was deposited by Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD) at a substrate\ntemperature of 800 \u00b0C at an oxygen pressure of 120 mTorr on a 500 \u03bcm-thick (001) LaAlO3 (LAO)\nsubstrate. Milling of the BSTO film was performed with a focused 50 keV Ga+ ion beam. The film was\nremoved from a 5 \u03bcm-width trench around a 20 \u03bcm by 20 \u03bcm square island. As a result of the milling the\nmaterial inside the trench as well as in some vicinity of the trench was doped with Ga. The structure was\nannealed at 600 \u00b0C in oxygen for 1 hour after milling to partially restore the damage caused by the milling.\nSuch an annealing treatment has been shown to significantly improve the dielectric properties of the BSTO\nfilm in the damaged area.17\nBasic details of the microscope system used in the present work were described elsewhere.18,19\nHere we summarize the additional features of the broadband microscope. The microscope is based on a\nhalf-wavelength coaxial transmission line resonator of length 25 cm with the inner conductor terminated by\nan Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM) tungsten tip with about 1 \u03bcm-radius apex (Fig. 2). A microwave\nsignal is generated by a synthesized microwave source (Agilent E8257C PSG Analog Signal Generator).\nThe microwave power reflected from the resonator back into the feed line is monitored by a feedback\ncircuit, which locks the frequency of the microwave source to the chosen resonance mode. At a resonance\nfrequency, the reflection coefficient (Fig. 2(b)) passes a local minimum. The coupling of the feed line with\nthe resonator can be accomplished by means of either a capacitor or an inductor coil inserted in the inner\n\n4\n\n\fconductor between the resonator and the feed line. The best performance of the system can be achieved at\nmodes close to the frequency of critical coupling of the resonator. (At the critical coupling, the reflection\nfrom the resonator at the resonant frequency is equal to zero). This condition dictated the use of several\ndifferent coupling elements for broadband imaging, tuned for different frequency sub-bands. For the\nbroadband experiments in this work, we used a modified SMA connector with miniature gold wire coils in\nplace of the central conductor to couple the resonator with the feed line. Three coils with different\ninductances were used to cover the frequency range from 1 GHz to 17.5 GHz. Broadband imaging was\nperformed by switching from one resonance mode of the microscope to another upon completion of the\nscanning frame at a previous frequency. The sample was maintained in constant contact with the probe tip\nby application of a small force of 30-50 \u03bcN to the sample.\nFor extraction of data on film permittivity, we used the approach outlined by Steinhauer et al.19. It\nis based on the perturbation formulas for resonant cavities and involves finite element calculations of fields\naround the probe tip in the air and in the sample in the electrostatic approximation. The procedure requires\nprobe calibration against reference samples with known properties (e.g. bulk dielectric substrates). Refining\nthat approach, in the present work, we more accurately described the geometry of the probe and used the\nANSOFT Maxwell 2D finite element analysis package to evaluate the perturbation integrals. To reduce the\nsize of the finite element model, the sample is placed on a conducting plane, which is considered to be at a\nfloating potential in the numerical simulations.\n\nIII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\na) frequency shift images\nThe upper panel of Fig. 3 shows a higher contrast and lower resolution frequency shift image over\nan 80 \u03bcm x 45 \u03bcm area of the FIB-milled structure, obtained by means of a blunter and therefore more\nsensitive tip. The image was taken at a frequency of 1.4 GHz. The FIB-milled trench looks like a broad\nblack stripe (labeled \"A\" in Fig. 3) fringed with white lines (\"B\"). The bottom of the trench is heavily\ndoped with Ga ions and relatively strongly conducting, producing a large frequency shift compared to the\nBSTO film. The small-frequency-shift white fringing is due to an \"edge effect\" when the tip apex is\n\n5\n\n\fpartially in contact with the film and partially hangs over the trench. The trench is surrounded on both sides\nby darker regions (\"C\") of Ga-doped BSTO film. The FIB beam has substantial tails that dope regions\noutside the main focus. The corners of the island surrounded by the trench (\"D\") are more heavily doped\nand are more conducting. Farther away is a broad brighter region of damaged film (\"E\") with a lowered\ndielectric permittivity producing a smaller frequency shift. A 1 \u03bcm-wide FIB-milled line (\"F\") is also seen\nalong the left edge of the image. Bright spots (\"G\") result from holes in the film and particles of the PLD\ntarget material usually present on the surface of PLD-grown films.\nThe lower panel of Fig. 3 shows how the frequency shift contrast of the same region evolves with\nfrequency. The image for f = 2.2 GHz looks similar to that for f = 1.4 GHz. At f = 8.7 GHz, the \"edge\neffect\" is still clearly seen, but the contrast between the trench bottom and the surrounding film is almost\nabsent. There is no visible contrast between Ga-doped and undoped regions outside the trench. A slight\ncontrast between the damaged area and the intact film is visible. At the highest frequency used in the\nexperiments, f = 17.4 GHz, the trench looks white on a dark background. At this frequency, the frequency\nshift at the trench bottom is noticeably smaller than that for the surrounding and quite close to that\ncorresponding to the LAO substrate without a film. A contrast between the damaged area and the intact film\nis still visible. It is worth noting here that images of film dielectric tunability (see Ref. 19 for the\nmeasurement method details) obtained simultaneously with the frequency shift images, all look similar to\neach other, regardless of frequency.\n\nb) theoretical model\nTo interpret the transformation of the contrast of the images in Fig. 3, let us consider the\nrelationship between the frequency shift and the sample properties in terms of the equivalent circuits in\nmore detail. As mentioned above, the resonant frequency of the resonator is determined by measuring the\nmicrowave power reflected from the resonator back into the feed line. The complex reflection coefficient \u0393\nfor voltage can be expressed through the reflection coefficients of the resonator coupling element \u0393c and the\nterminating tip \u0393t in the following form:20\n\n6\n\n\f\u0393c + \u0393t e \u22122 \u03b3L \u2212 2\u0393c \u0393t e \u22122 \u03b3L\n.\n1 \u2212 \u0393c \u0393t e \u2212 2 \u03b3L\n\n\u0393=\n\nHere, \u03b3 = \u03b1 + j\n\n\u03c9\n\n(1)\n\n\u03b5 is the complex transmission line propagation constant, L is the length of the\n\nc\n\nresonator, \u03c9 is the angular frequency, \u03c9=2\u03c0f, c is the speed of the light in vacuum, \u03b1 is the attenuation in\nthe transmission line, and \u03b5 is the relative permittivity of the transmission line dielectric. The expression Eq.\n(1) can be obtained by summing contributions from all partial waves multiply reflected in the resonator and\ncontributing to the wave going back into the feed line.\nThe condition for the resonant minimum of the reflection coefficient:\n\nd\u0393\n\nd2 \u0393\n\n2\n\nd\u03c9\n\n= 0,\n\n2\n\n>0\n\nd\u03c9 2\n\n(2)\n\ndefines in implicit form the resonant frequency \u03c9r (ci ) as a function of a set of the parameters ci of the tip\nequivalent circuit. (For example, the set of ci's for the circuit in Fig. 1(c) is: Csc, Cs, Cstr, and Rs.) One is not\ninterested in the value of \u03c9r, but rather in the change of the resonant frequency \u2206\u03c9r caused by a change of\nthe sample properties. Under the condition of a weak frequency dependence of the reflection coefficients \u0393c\nand \u0393t:\n\nf0\n\n\u2202 \u0393c ,t\n\n<< 1,\n\n\u2202\u03c9\n\n\u2202Arg(\u0393c ,t )\n\nf0\n\n\u2202\u03c9\n\n<< 1 ,\n\n(3)\n\nit can be found by a straightforward calculation with use of Eqs. (2) that for a small perturbation caused by\nthe sample:\n\n\u2206\u03c9r \u2248\n\n\u2211 \u2202\u03be \u2202c dc\ni\n\n\u2202\u03be\n\ni\n\ni\n\n,\n\n(4)\n\n\u2202\u03c9\n\n(\n\n)\n\nwhere \u03be = Arg \u0393c \u0393t e \u22122\u03b3L , and f 0 =\n\nc\nis the lowest mode frequency of a free half-wave resonator\n2L \u03b5\n\nwith length L. We note that \u03be is the change of the phase of a partial wave within the resonator for one round\ntrip between the coupling element ant the tip. Equations (3) demand a weak frequency dependence of the\n\n7\n\n\freflection coefficients \u0393c and \u0393t within the resonant frequency shift for each resonant mode, and thereby set\ncertain requirements to the design of the resonator-feed line coupling. Further, taking the derivatives of \u03be\nwith account of the second of Eqs. (3), we find \u2202\u03be \u2202\u03c9 \u2248 1 f 0 ,\n\n\u2211 (\u2202\u03be\n\n\u2202ci )dci = \u2211 (\u2202Arg(\u0393t ) \u2202ci )dci ,\n\nand after that we obtain:\n\n\u2206\u03c9 r \u2248 f 0 \u2211\ni\n\n\u2202Arg(\u0393t )\ndci .\n\u2202ci\n\n(5)\n\nThe complex reflection coefficient \u0393t can be written in the form \u0393t =\n\n1\u2212 z\nwith\n1+ z\n\nz = Z 0Yt (\u03c9 , ci ) = Z 0 [Gt (\u03c9 , ci ) + jBt (\u03c9 , ci )] . Here Yt = 1/Zt, Gt, and Bt are the effective tip admittance,\nconductance and susceptance, respectively. Z0 is the characteristic impedance of the resonator transmission\nline. Further, we neglect the actual tip resistance Rt (Fig. 1(c)). Provided that |z| << 1, one gets:\n\n\u2202Arg(\u0393t )\n\u2202\u03b6\n\u2202\u03b7\n,\n\u2248 \u22124\u03b6\u03b7\n\u22122\n\u2202ci\n\u2202ci\n\u2202ci\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u03b6 = Re z, and \u03b7 = Im z, and if:\n\n\u03b6\u03b7\n\n\u2202\u03b6\n\u2202\u03b7\n,\n<<\n\u2202ci\n\u2202ci\n\n(7)\n\none can write for the frequency shift:\n\n\u2206\u03c9r \u2248 \u22122Z 0 f 0 \u2211\ni\n\n\u2202Bt\ndci .\n\u2202ci\n\n(8)\n\nAnd finally, expressing the tip susceptance through the effective tip capacitance Bt=\u03c9 Ct, we obtain:\n\n\u2206\u03c9r\n\n\u03c9r\n\n\u2248 \u22122 Z 0 f 0 \u2211\ni\n\n\u2202Ct\ndci .\n\u2202ci\n\n(9)\n\nNote that as follows from the last expression, the relative frequency shift does not depend on frequency\ndirectly in the approximations used here. Hence the frequency dependence of the relative frequency shift\nappears only through the frequency dependence of the properties of the tip-sample system.\nDirect measurements and calculations show that the conditions of Eqs. (3) and (7) setting the\nvalidity range for the approximations are fulfilled in our microscope. Being equipped with Eq. (9), we can\n\n8\n\n\fanalyze the frequency response of the microscope using the equivalent circuit Fig. 1(c) with {ci}={Cstr, Csc,\nCs, Rs}. The change of the effective tip capacitance due to a sample is:\n\ndCt = \u2211\ni\n\n\u2202Ct\n\u2202Ct\ndci =\ndC str + C p ( f ),\n\u2202ci\n\u2202C str\n\n(10)\n\nwhere Cp(f) is the frequency-dependent parallel capacitance of the simpler circuit consisting of only three\nelements Csc, Cs, and Rs, as shown in the inset of the upper panel of Fig. 4. This circuit, with well-known\nproperties, allows us to reproduce all essential features of the resonator frequency behavior in the region of\nvalidity of the electrostatic approximation. The change of the effective tip conductance Gp(f) due to a\nsample can be introduced similar to Cp(f). For the following analysis of the frequency response of the\nmicroscope, we neglect the stray capacitance Cstr because it is a frequency-independent additive to the\nparallel capacitance Cp(f). The phase response of the circuit determined mainly by the value of the parallel\ncapacitance Cp(f), governs the phase change of the wave in the transmission line upon reflection from the\ntip, and hence, the resonant frequency shift. In the Appendix it is shown that the effective tip conductance\nGp(f) determines the change of the Q-factor of the resonant modes.\nThe frequency behavior of Cp and Gp/(2\u03c0f) with frequency-independent values of Csc, Cs, and Rs is\nshown in Fig. 4 in a dimensionless coordinate system. The capacitance and conductance are measured in\nvalues of Csc, and the unit of frequency f is (2\u03c0)-1. As can be seen from Fig. 4, at frequencies much higher\nthan the pole frequency defined by the expression \u03c9 (Csc + Cs ) Rs = 1 , the value of Cp is very weakly\ndependent on Rs and the conductance contrast becomes \"invisible\" for the microwave frequency shift. The\ntransformation of the contrast of the images of Fig. 3 with increasing frequency can be explained by this\nfact. At high enough frequencies and under the condition Cs<< Csc, the microscope response becomes\nsensitive only to the dielectric properties of the sample. Optimal frequencies for imaging of particular\nproperties can be found with use of Eqs. (9) and (A.5) as points of the maximum absolute values of partial\nderivatives over the equivalent circuit parameters.\n\n9\n\n\fc) quantitative analysis\nFigure 5 shows relative frequency shift referenced to the bare LAO substrate versus frequency for\nfour different locations around the milled trench. The notation for different parts of the film correspond to\nthose of Fig. 3. Point \"D\" with a strong dependence of the frequency shift on frequency below about 6 GHz\nis close to the island corner and it received the largest Ga dose outside the trench. The dashed lines in Fig. 5\nare guides to the eye. The factors with the largest contribution to the measurement error are the calibration\nerror due to incomplete representation of the actual tip shape by numerical calculations made in the probe\ncalibration process and the progressive damage of the tip during scanning. The overall measurement error\ndue to these factors was estimated by numerical calculations and is reflected by the error bars in the plot.\nThe curved solid (green) line in Fig. 5 is the frequency shift relative to the bare LAO substrate\ncalculated using Eq. (9) for the tip-sample system model of Fig. 1(c) with the following parameters:\nZ0=50 \u03a9, Csc=50 fF, Cstr =11.7 fF, Cs=5.7 fF, Rs=10 k\u03a9, CsLAO=3.9 fF, RsLAO is equal to infinity. The last\ntwo values are for a bare LAO substrate. The curve corresponds to the most Ga-doped and, therefore, most\nconducting part of the film. The estimated pole frequency for this case is 285 MHz. The increase of the\nfrequency shift observed at lower frequencies at the island corners corresponds in fact to the end of the\nslope of the Cp-vs.-frequency curve of Fig. 4.The horizontal straight solid (red) line in Fig. 5 is the result for\nthe same model, but with Rs=10 M\u03a9, representing the undoped area. The value of Cstr was determined by\nmeasuring the resonant frequency shift after insertion of the probe tip into the open end of the resonator\nrelative to the resonance frequency of the resonator without the tip. The value of CsLAO was obtained by\nnumerical finite element calculations, and the values of Cs and Rs were chosen to fit the experimental data,\nand they are on the order of magnitude expected.\nAs we see, Eq. (9) and the equivalent circuit Fig. 1(c) fairly well describe the measurement results\nup to a frequency of about 11 GHz. The experimental points at frequencies higher than 11 GHz deviate\nfrom the theoretical curve and show smaller relative frequency shifts. Two possible factors which might\ncause the observed behavior of the frequency shift at higher frequencies are the dispersion of the dielectric\npermittivity of the film, and the deformation of the probe tip during scanning.\n\n10\n\n\fBased on the measured frequency shifts, we have calculated the relative permittivity of the film and\nfound that the relative permittivity of the intact BSTO film (see Fig. 5) is 550\u00b170 at frequencies below\n11 GHz. The relative permittivity of the damaged film (points \"D\" and \"E\", Fig. 5) is about 100 lower. The\nrelative permittivity of the intact film at f = 17.4 GHz would be close to 350 if it is calculated in the same\nway, which means an (unlikely) drop of 200 upon frequency change from 10.9 GHz to 17.4 GHz. This drop\nis too large and cannot be attributed to dispersion of the dielectric properties of the BSTO of any origin.\nTaking into account the data of Refs. 7 and 21, one should expect a change in the relative dielectric constant\ndue to dispersion to be less than 100 in the whole frequency range from 1 GHz to 18 GHz . In fact, the\ndispersion of the BSTO properties could not be detected with our setup, and therefore, it is less than the\nmeasurement error of about 140, which is in agreement with Refs. 7 and 21. The frequencies during the highfrequency experiment were changed in the following order: 17.4 GHz, 14.7 GHz, 8.7 GHz, 10.9 GHz, and\n13.0 GHz. Hence, the downward trend seen in the curve at increasing frequency cannot be explained by a\nprogressive change of the tip shape in the flow of the experiment, either.\nWe suggest that the deviation can be attributed to an enhanced contribution of radiated and\nevanescent excitations at the probe tip to the resonator response, which is not captured by the electrostatic\nnumerical calculation. It should be noted that the relevant sample dimensions are not much smaller than the\nmicrowave wavelength \u03bb at the higher frequencies. Indeed, at a frequency of 15 GHz, for instance, \u03bbLAO \u2248 4\nmm in the LAO substrate with a relative permittivity \u03b5 \u2248 25, whereas the substrate thickness d \u2248 \u03bb/8 (d =\n0.5 mm). A noticeable deviation of the field structure in the film from the static one can be expected in this\nsituation, and a full-wave analysis is needed to clarify the observed high-frequency behavior of the\nfrequency shift.\nStandard practical restrictions on the application of lumped-element models in the characterization\nof high frequency circuits is that the dimensions of the circuit elements should be less than \u03bb/20. If this\ncondition is applied to our microscope configuration, the lumped element model and the near-field\nelectrostatic approximation can be used for measurements at frequencies below ~6 GHz only. Nevertheless,\nthe broadband imaging still turns out to be useful in revealing the more conducting areas of the films as is\nevident from Fig. 3.\n\n11\n\n\fFinally, we would like to note that in future versions of the broadband microscope, frequency\nshould be swept at each point (pixel) on the sample. The dielectric properties of the materials can be\nextracted then by fitting the frequency dependences for each sample point separately. One condition to\nrealization of such an approach is design of a resonator-feed line coupling element capable of working in a\nwide frequency range with the coupling constant \u03b2 close to unity (\u03b2 = 1 corresponds to the critical coupling;\nat \u03b2 = 1 the reflection coefficient from the resonator at the resonance is equal to zero). Further, design of\nthe tip-sample system in such a way that its pole frequency is close to the center of the frequency range\ncovered by the microscope is another necessary condition for an effective realization of the broadband\napproach.\n\nACKNOWLEGDMENTS\nThe work was supported by the University of Maryland/Rutgers NSF MRSEC under grant DMR00-80008.

Here we\ndiscuss in more detail the role of the parallel tip conductance Gp (inset Fig. 4) in the microscope response,\nin particular the quality factor Q. At a resonance, the ratio of the complex amplitudes of a partial wave\nwithin the resonator before, A1 , and after, A2 , one round trip between the coupling element and the tip can\nbe expressed with use of a complex frequency \u03c9\u02c6 = \u03c9 \u2032 + j\u03c9 \u2032\u2032 as:\n\nA2\n= exp j (\u03c9\u02c6 T0 + \u03c6 t + \u03c6 c ) = \u0393t \u0393c exp(\u22122\u03b3L),\nA1\n\n(A.1)\n\nwhere T0 = 1 / f 0 is the time of the round trip, and \u03c6t,c are phase shifts of the wave upon reflection from the\ntip and the coupling element, respectively. It follows from the definition of \u03b3 that \u03c9 \u2032 \u2261 \u03c9 and\n\n\u03c9 \u2032\u2032 = f 0 (2\u03b1L \u2212 ln \u0393c \u2212 ln \u0393t\n\n)\n\n(A.2)\n\nThe Q-factor of a resonator can be written in the following form:\n\nQ=\n\n\u03c9\u2032\n.\n2\u03c9 \u2032\u2032\n\n(A.3)\n\nSimilar to the steps leading to Eqs. (5) and (8), we obtain:\n\nd\u03c9 \u2032\u2032 \u2248 2 Z 0 f 0 \u2211\ni\n\n\u2202Gt\ndci .\n\u2202ci\n\n(A.4)\n\nFor the validity of the last approximate expression, it is required that \u03b6\u03b7\n\n\u2202\u03b7\n\u2202\u03b6\n<<\n, and it is assumed\n\u2202ci\n\u2202ci\n\nthat \u03c9\u2032 is fixed. Gt \u2261 Gp(f) of the circuit in Fig. 4, and for changes of losses due to the sample we have:\n\n\u239b1\u239e\n1\n\u2206\u239c\u239c \u239f\u239f = 4 f 0 Z 0 \u2206G p .\n\u03c9\u2032\n\u239dQ\u23a0\n\n(A.5)\n\nThe amplitude response of the circuit Fig. 1(c) is determined mainly by its parallel conductance Gp. The\nvalue Gp/(2\u03c0f) directly determines the losses and the change of the resonator quality factor due to the\nsample. This value has a maximum at the pole frequency defined by the expression \u03c9 (Csc + Cs ) Rs = 1 ,\ncorresponding to the maximum of losses and to the minimum of the Q-factor.\n\n14\n\n\fFig. 1.

The microwave signal is\ngenerated by the source, enters the resonator through the coupling coil, interacts with the sample, and is\ndetected upon reflection outside the resonator.
