The relative abundance of the isolated clusters should depend on how strong the gravitational clustering is on\nthe largest scale and how frequently the clusters merge into the superclusters in the Universe.\nTherefore, it is expected that the relative abundance of the isolated massive clusters may be\nuseful to distinguish between different candidate dark energy models.\nTo predict the relative abundance of isolated clusters in different dark energy models,\nhowever, a theoretical framework is first required within which the number density of isolated clusters can be separately counted. The standard excursion set formalism has been\nconventionally employed to analytically calculate the number density of galaxy clusters as\na function of mass, i.e., the mass function of galaxy clusters. Basically, the standard excursion set formalism counts the initial regions whose linearly extrapolated density contrast (\u03b4)\nexceeds a fixed threshold value (\u03b4c ) on a certain mass scale M, regarding them as the sites\nwhich would eventually collapse to form the bound objects of mass M (Press & Schechter\n1974; Bond et al. 1991). The density threshold \u03b4c which is often called the collapse barrier\nhas a constant value of \u03b4sc = 1.686 if the gravitational collapse process follows the spherical\ndynamics (Gunn & Gott 1972).\nMaggiore & Riotto (2010a,b) have for the first time introduced the concept of the\nstochastic collapse barrier to generalize the excursion set formalism. In the light of the\nnumerical result of Robertson et al. (2009), Maggiore & Riotto (2010a,b) regarded the collapse barrier, \u03b4c , as a log-normal variable, and showed that in the high-mass limit the collapse\nbarrier has a spherical average of h\u03b4c i = \u03b4sc = 1.686. Very recently, Corasaniti & Achitouv\n(2011a,b) have made a further refinement of the mass function theory by incorporating the\nellipsoidal collapse dynamics into the generalized excursion set formalism. They extended\nthe generalized excursion set formalism to the case that the mean collapse barrier, h\u03b4c i, deviates from the spherical average, \u03b4sc = 1.686 in the low-mass limit. The higher collapse\nbarrier than the spherical average, \u03b4c > 1.686, corresponds to the case that the formation of\nthe low-mass halos experience the disturbing tidal effect from the surroundings.\nWe note here that the Corasaniti-Achitouv formalism should be applicable not only to\nthe case that the gravitational collapse occurs non-spherically in the low-mass section but\nalso to the case that the massive halos form in isolated low-density environments. Given that\nthe massive cluster-size halos are likely to form in the highly overdense regions but hardly in\nthe isolated low-density regions, the collapse barrier for the formation of the isolated clusters\nshould be higher than the spherical average. Since the Corasaniti-Achitouv formalism allows\nthe average collapse barrier to deviate from the spherical value of 1.686, their formalism may\nbe capable of deriving the mass function of the isolated clusters.\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nThe organization of this paper is as follows. In \u00a72 we briefly review the CorasanitiAchitouv formalism of the halo mass function. In \u00a73 we explain how the relative abundance\nof the isolated clusters can be evaluated by modifying the Corasaniti-Achitouv formalism\nand present the results of the numerical tests. In \u00a74 we show how sensitively the relative\nabundance of the isolated clusters depends on the dark energy equation of state as well as\nthe other key cosmological parameters. \u00a75 we summarize the results and conclude the work.\n2.\n\nTHE CORASANITI-ACHITOUV FORMALISM\n\nThe mass function of bound halos, dN/d ln M, is defined as the number density of the\nbound objects whose masses belong to the differential mass interval [ln M, ln M + d ln M]\n(Press & Schechter 1974). The classical mass function theory based on the standard excursion set formalism relates dN/d ln M to the multiplicity function, f (\u03c3), which gives the\nnumber density of the random-walks crossing a specified collapse barrier, \u03b4c , when the pseudo\ntime variable has the value of \u03c3 (Bond et al. 1991; Jedamzik 1995):\ndN(M, z)\n\u03c1\u0304 d ln \u03c3 \u22121\n=\nf [\u03c3(M, z)].\nd ln M\nM d ln M\n\n(1)\n\nHere \u03c1\u0304 is the mean mass density of the Universe and the pseudo time variable \u03c3(M, z) is\nequivalent to the rms density fluctuation of the linear density field smoothed on the mass\nscale M at redshift z. It scales with the linear growth factor, D(z), as \u03c3(M, z) \u2261 D(z)\u03c3(M)\nwith \u03c3(M) \u2261 \u03c3(M, z = 0). Throughout \u00a72 and \u00a73, we assume a flat \u039bCDM cosmology (with\n\u03a9m = 0.25, \u03a9\u039b = 0.75, \u03a9b = 0.045, h = 0.7, ns = 0.95 and \u03c38 = 0.8), for which the linear\ngrowth factor has the following analytical expression (Lahav et al. 1991):\nZ \u221e\n5\n1 + z\u2032\n3\n1/2\nD(z) \u221d \u03a9m [\u03a9m (1 + z) + \u03a9\u039b ]\n.\n(2)\ndz \u2032\n2\n[\u03a9m (1 + z \u2032 )3 + \u03a9\u039b ]3/2\nz\nHere D(z) is normalized to satisfy D(z = 0) = 1.\nIn the original Press-Schechter theory where the gravitational collapse is assumed to occur spherically, the collapse barrier has a constant value of \u03b4sc = 1.686. In the Press-Schechter\nvariants developed afterward to improve the accuracy of the halo mass function by accounting for the ellipsoidal collapse process (e.g., Bond & Myers 1996; Monaco 1997; Audit et al.\n1997; Lee & Shandarin 1998; Sheth & Tormen 1999; Jenkins et al. 2001; Warren et al. 2006;\nTinker et al. 2008; Robertson et al. 2009), the collapse barrier is described not as a constant but as a function of the mass scale M (or equivalently, a function of the rms density\nfluctuation, \u03c3).\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nRecently, Maggiore & Riotto (2010a,b, hereafter MR10) pointed out that not only the\nconstant spherical collapse barrier but also the scale-dependent ellipsoidal collapse barrier is\nincapable of describing the true nature of the complicated halo formation process and suggested that the collapse barrier \u03b4c should be treated as a stochastic variable. MR10 derived an\nanalytic expression for the halo mass function by generalizing the excursion set formalism for\nthe case that the collapse barrier is stochastic and the random walk process is non-Markovian.\nIt was shown by MR10 that in the high-mass limit (M \u2265 1014 h\u22121 M\u2299 ) the average of the\nstochastic collapse barrier equals the constant spherical value, h\u03b4c i = \u03b4sc = 1.686 and its variance is scale-dependent as h\u22062 DB i = \u03c3 2 (M)DB where DB is called the diffusion coefficient.\nThe stochasticity of the collapse barrier is caused by the disturbance from the surroundings\nand the ambiguity in the halo-identification procedure (see Maggiore & Riotto 2010b, for a\ndetailed explanation).\nIn the light of the MR10 work, Corasaniti & Achitouv (2011a,b, hereafter CA11) have\nextended the generalized excursion set formalism to the ellipsoidal collapse case in which the\naverage of \u03b4c deviates from the spherical value, 1.686, in the low-mass section. The resulting\nCA11 multiplicity function has two characteristic coefficients: the diffusion coefficient DB\ndefined as in the MR10 formalism and the drifting average coefficient, \u03b2, defined as h\u03b4c i \u2261\n\u03b4sc + \u03b2. The non-zero value of this drifting average coefficient, \u03b2, quantifies the degree of\nthe deviation of the average of the collapse barrier from the spherical average 1.686, while\nthe non-zero value of the diffusion coefficient DB quantifies the degree of the stochasticity\nof the collapse barrier \u03b4c .\nThe CA11 multiplicity function f (\u03c3) was written at second order as\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\nf (\u03c3; DB , \u03b2) \u2248 f (0) (\u03c3; DB ) + f\u03b2=0 (\u03c3; DB ) + f\u03b2 (\u03c3; DB ) + f\u03b2 2 (\u03c3; DB ),\n\n(3)\n\nwhere\nf (0) (\u03c3; DB ) =\n(1)\n\nf\u03b2=0 (\u03c3; DB ) =\n(1)\n\nf\u03b2 (\u03c3; DB ) =\n(1)\n\nf\u03b2 2 (\u03c3; DB ) =\n\nr\n(\u03b4sc +\u03b2\u03c3 2 )2\n\u03b4sc\n2 \u2212 2\u03c3\n\u221a\ne 2 (1+DB ) ,\n\u03c3 1 + DB \u03c0\nr \u0014\n\u0015\n2\n1\n\u03b4sc 2a \u2212 a\u03b4sc\ne 2\u03c32 \u2212 \u0393 (0, x) ,\n\u2212\u03ba\u0303\n\u03c3\n\u03c0\n2\nh\ni\n(1)\n\u2212\u03b2 a \u03b4sc f\u03b2=0 (\u03c3) + \u03ba\u0303 Erfc (x) ,\nr h\n\u0013\n\u0012\nio\nn\n2\n2\n3 a\u03b4sc\n\u03c3\n1\na \u2212 a\u03b4sc\n2 2 2\ne 2\u03c32\n\u2212 2x +\n\u0393\n(0,\nx)\n,\n\u03b2 a \u03b4sc \u03ba\u0303 Erfc (x) +\na\u03b4sc 2\u03c0\n2\n4 \u03c32\n\n(4)\n(5)\n(6)\n(7)\n\np\nwith x \u2261 (\u03b4sc /\u03c3) a/2, a = 1/(1 + DB ), \u03ba\u0303 = \u03ba a, k = 0.475, and incomplete Gamma\nfunction \u0393(0, x). Here, f (0) (\u03c3; DB ) coincides with the MR10 multiplicity function which\nhas only one parameter DB . Computing the halo mass functions through Equations (1)(7) and comparing them with the fitting formula given by Tinker et al. (2008), CA11 have\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\ndetermined the best-fit values of the two coefficients as \u03b2 = 0.057 and DB = 0.294. CA11\nhave also shown how the shape of the halo mass function changes with the values of DB and\n\u03b2 (see Figure 3 in Corasaniti & Achitouv 2011b). According to their results, the variation\nof the diffusion coefficient DB alters the high-end slope of f (\u03c3) while the variation of the\ndrifting average coefficient \u03b2 affects the over-all amplitude of f (\u03c3).\nNow, we would like to confirm the validity of the CA11 mass function by testing it\nagainst the high-resolution MICE simulations (Crocce et al. 2010) which traced the evolution\nof 20483 dark matter particles (each having mass of 23.42 \u00d7 1010 h\u22121 M\u2299 ) on a periodic box\nwith linear size of 3 h\u22121 Gpc for a \u039bCDM cosmology. We utilize the publicly available catalog\nof the cluster halos that were identified via the standard Friends-of-Friends (FoF) algorithm.\nThe catalog provides information on each halo's (comoving) position, peculiar velocity and\nFoF mass (calculated as the sum of the masses of all the dark matter particles belonging to\neach halo) at three different redshifts: z = 0, 0.5, 1. For a detailed description of the MICE\nsimulations and the cluster catalogs, we refer the readers to Crocce et al. (2010).\nBinning the logarithmic masses of the cluster halos from the MICE catalog and counting\nthe number densities of the cluster halos belonging to each logarithmic mass-bin, we obtain\nthe numerical mass function of all cluster halos, dNT /d ln M, at each redshift. Fitting\nthe CA11 formula (Eqs [1]-[7]) to the numerical results from the MICE simulations at each\nredshift, we have determined the best-fit values of \u03b2 and DB with the help of the \u03c72 statistics,\nthe results of which are listed in Table 1.\nNote that the diffusion coefficient, DB , has the same best-fit value of 0.38 at all three\nredshifts while the best-fit value of the drifting average coefficient, \u03b2, increases as the redshift\ndecreases. The result indicates that at earlier epochs the gravitational collapse process is\ncloser to the spherical dynamics than at present epoch. Since a bound halo is harder to form\nat earlier epochs, those high-z halos must correspond to higher peaks in the initial density\nfield. As shown analytically by Bernardeau (1994), the higher a local density peak is, the\nmore spherically its gravitational collapse proceeds.\nIt is also worth mentioning that our result on the best-fit value of DB = 0.38 is different\nfrom the original value DB = 0.27 used in the CA11 formalism. This discrepancy must be\ndue to the fact that we use the FoF masses available in the MICE catalog while the spherical\nover-density (SO) masses were considered in the original CA11 work.\nFigure 1 plots the CA11 mass functions with the best-fit values of \u03b2 and DB (solid line)\nand compare them with the numerical results from the MICE simulations (square dots) at\nz = 0, 0.5 and 1 in the top-left, top-middle and top-right panels, respectively. The Jackknife\nmethod is employed to calculate the errors: Dividing the halos into eight subsamples (each\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nhaving the same number of the halos) and determining dNT /d ln M separately from each\nsubsample, the errors are calculated as one \u03c3 scatter of dNT /d ln M among the eight Jackknife\nresamples. Figure 1 also plots the ratio of the analytic mass function to the numerical result\nas a function of mass at z = 0, 0.5 and 1 in the bottom-left, bottom-middle and bottom-right\npanel, respectively. As can be seen, the analytical and numerical mass functions agree with\neach other quite at all three redshifts, except in the high-mass section (M > 1015 h\u22121 M\u2299 )\nwhere the Jackknife errors are very large.\n\n3.\n\nMASS FUNCTION OF THE ISOLATED CLUSTERS\n\nApplying the FoF algorithm with the linkage length parameter of b to the MICE cluster\ncatalogs at each redshift, we first find the clusters of clusters (i.e., superclusters) which have\nmore than one neighbor clusters within the FoF linkage length, b \u0304l where  \u0304l is the mean cluster\nseparation. The isolated clusters are then identified as those clusters which do not belong\nto any superclusters. Note that the degree of their isolation depends on the value of b:\nThe larger the value of b is, the more isolated they are. Here we consider the extreme case\nin which the isolated clusters experience no disturbance from the surrounding large-scale\nstructures and the difference between their FoF and SO masses is negligible. In this extreme\ncase, the value of the diffusion coefficient, DB , must vanish since the non-zero value of DB\nindicates the presence of the disturbance from the surroundings and the existence of the\ndifference between the FoF and SO masses.\nThe ad-hoc value of the linkage length parameter for this extreme case is determined\nto be b = 0.4 by the following procedures. We first investigate how the best-fit value of DB\nchanges as the value of b varies from 0.25 to 0.45 in the FoF algorithm applied to the MICE\ncluster catalogs. For each case of b, we select the isolated clusters from the MICE cluster\ncatalog and obtain the numerical mass function of the isolated clusters. Then, we fit the\nnumerical result to the analytic CA11 formula (Eq.[1]-[7]) to determine the best-fit values of\nDB and \u03b2 with the help of the \u03c72 statistics. Figure 2 plots the best-fit value of DB versus\nthe linkage length parameter b. As can be seen, the best-fit value of DB drops to zero when\nthe linkage length parameter b reaches up to 0.4. Table 2 lists the best-fit values of DB and\n\u03b2 for the mass function of the isolated clusters when the ad-hoc value of the linkage length\nparameter is set at b = 0.4.\nNow, we write the total mass function of all cluster halos, dNT /d ln M, as the sum of the\nmass function of the isolated cluster halos, dNI /d ln M and that of the non-isolated cluster\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nhalos, dNNI /d ln M:\ndNT (M, z)\ndNI (M, z) dNNI (M, z)\n=\n+\n.\n(8)\nd ln M\nd ln M\nd ln M\nPutting DB = 0 in the CA11 formula, we express the mass function of the isolated clusters\nas\n\u03c1\u0304 d ln \u03c3 \u22121\ndNI (M, z)\n=\nf [\u03c3; \u03b2, DB = 0].\n(9)\nd ln M\nM d ln M\nHere the multiplicity function of the isolated clusters which is characterized by one coefficient\n\u03b2 is written at second order as\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\nf (\u03c3; DB = 0, \u03b2) \u2248 f (0) (\u03c3) + f\u03b2=0 (\u03c3) + f\u03b2 (\u03c3) + f\u03b2 2 (\u03c3),\n\n(10)\n\nwhere\n\u03b4sc\n(\u03c3) =\n\u03c3\n\nr\n\n2 )2\n2 \u2212 (\u03b4sc +\u03b2\u03c3\n2\u03c3 2\ne\n,\n\u03c0\nr \u0014\n\u0015\n2\n1\n\u03b4sc 2 \u2212 \u03b4sc\n(1)\n2\nf\u03b2=0 (\u03c3) = \u2212\u03ba\ne 2\u03c3 \u2212 \u0393 (0, x) ,\n\u03c3 \u03c0\n2\nh\ni\n(1)\n(1)\nf\u03b2 (\u03c3) = \u2212\u03b2 \u03b4sc f\u03b2=0 (\u03c3) + \u03ba Erfc (x) ,\nr h\n\u0013\n\u0012\nio\nn\n2\n3 \u03b42\n1\n1 \u2212 \u03b4sc\n\u03c3\n(1)\n2 2\n2\ne 2\u03c3\n\u2212 2x + sc2 \u0393 (0, x) .\nf\u03b2 2 (\u03c3) = \u03b2 \u03b4sc \u03ba Erfc (x) +\n\u03b4sc 2\u03c0\n2\n4\u03c3\n\nf\n\n(0)\n\n(11)\n(12)\n(13)\n(14)\n\nFigure 3 plots the analytical mass functions of the isolated clusters (solid lines) with the\nbest-fit values of \u03b2 and compared them with the numerical results from the MICE simulations\n(square dots) at z = 0, 0.5 and 1 in the top-left, top-middle and top-right panel, respectively.\nAs can be seen, the analytical mass functions of the isolated clusters agree quite well with\nthe numerical results at all three redshifts. The ratios of the analytic CA11 formula to the\nnumerical results are plotted in the bottom panels. Although the agreements between the\nanalytical and the numerical results for the case of the isolated clusters are not so excellent\nas for the case of all cluster halos (see Figure 1), the ratio at each redshift is still quite close\nto unity: the discrepancy is less than 20% except in the high-mass limit where the Jackknife\nerrors are very large.\nThis result indicates that the CA11 formula with DB = 0 indeed works fairly well for\nthe determination of the mass function of the isolated clusters. It is worth emphasizing here\nthat this analytical mass function of the isolated clusters (Eq. [9]) has only one coefficient\n\u03b2 and there is no fitting normalization constant. The amplitude of dNI /d ln M is found to\nautomatically match the numerical result when the best-fit value of \u03b2 is put into the CA\nformula.\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nFigure 4 plots the ratio of the mass function of the isolated clusters to that of the nonisolated clusters at z = 0, 0.5 and 1 in the left, middle and right panel, respectively. The\nerrors are calculated as one \u03c3 scatter of the ratio among the eight Jackknife resamples. As\ncan be seen, the numerical result (square dots) agrees fairly well with the analytic prediction\n(solid line) based on the CA11 formula at each redshift. We believe that it would reduce the\nexisting discrepancy between the analytical and numerical results even more to include the\nhigher order terms in the calculation of the multiplicity function, f (\u03c3; DB , \u03b2). Throughout\nthis paper, however, we consider only the second order approximation of f (\u03c3; DB , \u03b2). Note\nthat the ratio drops with mass more rapidly at higher redshifts, indicating that at high\nredshifts most of the very massive clusters have stronger tendency to form in the highly\noverdense regions than at present epoch.\n\n4.\n\nDEPENDENCE ON THE DARK ENERGY EQUATION OF STATE\n\nIn a \u039bCDM cosmology the dark energy equation of state (defined as the ratio of the\npressure density to the energy density) is a perfect constant given as w \u2261 P\u039b /\u03c1\u039b = \u22121.\nWhereas in dynamic dark energy\nmodels the value of w may vary with time and can deviate from \u22121 at z = 0 (Wang & Steinhardt\n1998). This difference in the dark energy equation of state results in the different functional\nshape of D(z) (Chevallier & Polarski 2001; Linder 2003; Basilakos 2003; Percival 2005).\nThe evolution of the abundance of galaxy clusters has been regarded as one of the most\npowerful probes of w(z) (e.g., Wang & Steinhardt 1998; Haiman et al. 2001; Weller et al.\n2002). The most serious systematics in constraining w(z) with the evolution of the abundance of the galaxy clusters may come from the mass assignment of the high-z clusters.\nSeveral statistical methods have been suggested so far to overcome the systematics but none\nof them have yet to be fully satisfactory (e.g., Rykoff et al. 2008; Cunha & Evrard 2010;\nStanek et al. 2010, and references therein). See also Allen et al.(2011) for the latest review.\nWe suggest here that the relative abundance of the galaxy clusters at a given epoch provides\na complimentary probe of the dark energy equation of state.\nThe relative abundance of the isolated clusters is defined as the ratio of the cumulative\nmass function of the isolated clusters to that of the non-isolated clusters:\n\u0014Z \u221e\n\u0015 \u001e \u0014Z \u221e\n\u0015\ndNI (M, z)\ndNNI (M, z)\nd ln M\n\u03beI (Mc ; z) \u2261\nd ln M\n,\n(15)\nd ln M\nd ln M\nMc\nMc\nwhere the mass function of the non-isolated cluster dNNI /d ln M is obtained by dNT /d ln M \u2212\ndNI /d ln M. To demonstrate how the relative abundance of the isolated clusters \u03beI changes\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nwith the dark energy equation state w, we consider the specific case where the dark energy\nequation of state is redshift dependent as w(z) = w0 + w1 z/(1 + z) (Chevallier & Polarski\n2001; Linder 2003). Basilakos (2003) and Percival (2005) showed that for these dynamic\ndark energy models the linear growth factor can be approximated as:\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0015\u22121\n\u03a9mz\n5\u03a9mz\n\u03b1\n\u03a9 \u2212 \u03a9Qz + 1 +\n(1 + A\u03a9Qz )\nD(z) =\n,\n(16)\n2(z + 1) mz\n2\nwhere\n3 (1 \u2212 w)(1 \u2212 3w/2)\n3\n+\n[1 \u2212 \u03a9mz ],\n5 \u2212 2/(1 \u2212 w) 125\n(1 \u2212 6w/5)3\n0.28\nA = \u2212\n\u2212 0.3.\nw + 0.08\n\u03b1 =\n\n(17)\n(18)\n\nHere \u03a9mz and \u03a9Qz represent the matter density and dark energy density parameters at z,\nrespectively, related to their present values, \u03a9m and \u03a9Q as\n\u03a9mz =\n\n\u03a9m (1 + z)3\n,\nE 2 (z)\n\n\u03a9Qz =\n\n\u03a9Q\n.\nE 2 (z)(1 + z)f (z)\n\n(19)\n\nwhere\nE 2 (z) = \u03a9m (1 + z)3 + \u03a9Q (1 + z)\u2212f (z) ,\n3w1\n.\nf (z) = \u22123(1 + w0 ) \u2212\n2 ln(1 + z)\n\n(20)\n(21)\n\nWe first calculate \u03beI for the \u039bCDM case and then repeat the calculation of \u03beI for the four\ndifferent dynamic dark energy models at z = 0.5. Figure 5 plots the relative abundances of\nthe isolated clusters for the dynamic dark energy models and compare them with the \u039bCDM\ncase. The errors for the \u039bCDM case are calculated as one \u03c3 scatter of \u03beI among the eight\nJackknife resamples from the MICE cluster catalog. As can be seen, the five different dark\nenergy models predict different relative abundances of the isolated clusters. For the case of\nw1 > 0 (w1 < 0), the relative abundance of the isolated clusters has lower (higher) amplitude\nthan for the \u039bCDM case. This can be explained by the following logic. In a dark energy\nmodel with w1 > 0 (w1 < 0) the largest-scale powers are higher (lower) than in the \u039bCDM\ncase and thus boost the merging of the isolated clusters into the superclusters, reducing the\nrelative abundance of the isolated clusters.\nFurthermore, the differences in \u03beI between each dynamic dark energy case and the\n\u039bCDM case are larger than the statistical errors calculated through the Jackknife resampling.\nIf a future cluster survey can find as many clusters as the MICE simulations, the sensitivity\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nshown in Figure 5 suggests that the relative abundance of the isolated clusters will be a\npowerful probe of the dark energy equation of state in practice.\nWe examine the degeneracy between w0 and w1 . Varying the value of w0 from \u22121 to\n\u22120.9 and the value of w1 from \u22120.6 to 0.6, we repeatedly calculate \u03beI at z = 0.5, setting the\ncutoff mass scale at Mc = 3.35 \u00d7 1013 h\u22121 M\u2299 (the lowest cluster mass in the MICE catalog).\nThe contour curves of \u03beI in the w0 -w1 plane are plotted in Figure 6. When w0 is fixed, the\nrelative abundance of the isolated clusters decreases as the value of w1 increases, which is\nconsistent with Figure 5.\nWe also examine the degeneracy between \u03a9m and w1 and between \u03c38 and w1 at z = 0.5,\nwhich are plotted in the left and right panels of Figure 7, respectively. For these plots the\nvalue of w0 is set at \u22121. As can be seen, when w1 is fixed, the relative abundance of the\nisolated clusters, \u03beI , increases as the value of \u03a9m increases. This implies that if there is\nstronger gravitational effect due to the larger amount of dark matter, the formation of a\ncluster can occur more easily even in isolated low-density environments. For a given value\nof \u03beI , w1 increases with \u03a9m . A similar trend is found in the \u03c38 -w1 degeneracy curves. When\nw1 is fixed, \u03beI increases as the value of \u03c38 increases. The overall high density powers make\nit less hard for a cluster to form in the isolated low-density environments.\nIt is worth mentioning here that the degeneracy trends shown in Figures 6-7 are different from those obtained from the total cluster abundance (see Wang & Steinhardt 1998;\nWeller et al. 2002). The increase of w1 has the same effect on the cluster abundance as the\nincrease of \u03a9m and \u03c38 : the cluster abundance increases as the three parameters increase.\nIn contrast, when the relative abundance of isolated clusters is used, the increase of w1 has\nthe opposite effect: The relative abundance of the isolated clusters increases as w1 decreases\nand as \u03a9m and \u03c38 increase. This result implies that the relative abundance of the isolated\nclusters may be helpful to break the degeneracy between w1 and the other key cosmological\nparameters.\n\n5.\n\nSUMMARY AND DISCUSSION\n\nWe have derived the mass function of the isolated clusters in the frame of the recently\ndeveloped Corasaniti-Achitouv formalism, assuming that for the case of the isolated clusters\nthere is no disturbance from the surroundings and no ambiguity in the mass determination.\nThe numerical results from the MICE simulations have been used to determine empirically\nthe value of the drifting average coefficient, \u03b2, which quantifies the degree of the deviation\nof the collapse barrier for the formation of the isolated clusters from the standard average\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nvalue.\nExtrapolating the validity of the Corasaniti-Achitouv formalism to the dynamic dark\nenergy models and using our analytic result on the mass function of the isolated clusters, we\nhave shown that the relative abundance of the isolated clusters, \u03beI , defined as the ratio of\nthe cumulative mass function of the isolated clusters to that of the non-isolated clusters at\na given epoch, depends sensitively on the dark energy equation of state. This result proves\nour theoretical concept that the relative abundance of the isolated clusters is in principle a\npowerful probe of dark energy.\nYet, several additional works have to be done before constraining the dark energy equation of state with \u03beI . First, it will be necessary to derive the functional form of the drifting\naverage coefficient, \u03b2(z), for the isolated and non-isolated cases, separately. Second, it has\nto be confirmed if the Corasaniti-Achitouv formalism indeed works not only in a \u039bCDM\ncosmology but also in dynamic dark energy models and how the drifting average coefficient changes with the background cosmology. Third, it has to be examined whether or not\nthe higher-order perturbation terms in the Corasaniti-Achitouv formalism have any nonnegligible effect on the relative abundance of the isolated clusters. We plan to conduct these\nworks and wish to report the results elsewhere in the future.\nWe would also like to mention that our analytic model for the mass function of the\nisolated clusters will be useful not only as a probe of dark energy equation of state but also\nfor predicting more accurately the cluster-related statistics since the isolated massive clusters\nmay differ from the non-isolated ones in their physical properties such as average shape,\ndynamical state, gas entropy profile and etc (in private communication with E.Komatsu).\nI thank a referee for helpful suggestions and E.
