The main reason being\nthat they seem to be exceedingly simple model systems of\ncomplex behaviour in real world networks [1,2], including\nchemical reaction networks [3], food webs [4\u20136], the Internet [7,8] and the World-Wide-Web [9], metabolic [10] and\nprotein networks [11], scientific collaboration networks\n[12], etc. The hope is that the ideas and techniques developed in the last fifty years in the field of statistical physics\nto deal with cooperative phenomena in many body systems, may be useful to understand emergent complex\nbehaviour in systems outside the traditional realm of\nphysics. In particular, small-world (SW) networks, recently introduced by Watts and Strogatz [13], have been\nvery much studied because they constitute an interesting\nattempt to translate the complex topology of social, economic and physical networks into a simple model. SW\nnetworks result from randomly replacing a fraction p of\nlinks of a d-dimensional regular lattice with new random\nlinks. As a result of this random rewiring, SW networks\ninterpolate between the two limiting cases of a regular\nlattice (p = 0) and completely random graphs (p = 1).\nStudies of real network data have shown that SW-like\ntopologies are found in situations as diverse as the network of movie actors collaboration, the electric power\ngrid of Southern California, the network of world airports, the acquaintance network of Mormons, etc [1,2].\n\nuals, companies, airports, countries, etc., depending on\nthe social or economic process we are interested in. Actors are linked to one another by a relational, social or\nphysical tie like for instance, friendship, business transactions, flight connections, kinship, or scientific collaboration, among many others. Some of those relational\nlinks are symmetric, in the sense that if Alice is tied to\nBob, then Bob must also be tied to Alice, as occurs for\ninstance in the authorship of scientific papers. However,\nmany other networks are directed and exhibit links that\nare definitely asymmetric, like for instance in the case\nof networks of import-export of goods, world-wide-web\npages links, lending transactions, food webs, cultural influences, etc. In directed networks then, when Alice is\ntied to Bob, Bob may not be linked to Alice but to someone else instead. Asymmetric synaptic strengths have\nalready been shown to be very important in trying to describe the process of learning in realistic neural network\nmodel approaches to brain function [19,20].\nSeveral models have recently been studied in order to\nunderstand the effect of SW topology on classical systems\nlike the Ising model [14] or the spread of infections and\nepidemics [21,22]. Such a simple models are expected to\ncapture the essential features of the more complicated\nprocesses taking place on real networks. However, as\nmentioned earlier, many social, commercial or biological\nrelations are asymmetric and the following question naturally arises: What is the effect of directed links on a\nsimple model that evolves on the network?\n\nMany topological properties of the SW model have recently been investigated, as for instance the shortest-path\ndistance and clustering coefficient [13,14], the crossover\nfrom regular to SW behaviour occurring at p = 0 [15],\na mean-field solution [16], and percolation on SW networks [17] among others. Specifically, SW models are\nexpected to play an important role in understanding the\ninterplay between the underlying disordered network and\nthe dynamics of many social or economic processes, such\nas distribution of wealth, disease spreading, transmission\nof cultural traits, and formation of public opinion [1].\n\nIn this Letter we investigate the effect of directed SW\ntopology on the behaviour of a simple model. In case only\nundirected links are used, our model becomes identical to\nthe classical Ising model on a standard (undirected) SW\nnetwork [14]. This allows us to study, in a systematic\nway, the effect of directed ties on this classical model.\nWe find that the existence of directed links completely\nchanges the behaviour of the system from mean-field behaviour (for undirected networks) to a highly nontrivial\nand rich phase diagram in the case of directed networks.\nBy means of extensive numerical simulations we find\n\nIn the language of social network analysis [18], sites\nare referred to as actors. Actors may represent individ1\n\n\fthat, for rewiring probabilities in the range 0 < p < pc ,\nthe model exhibits a line of continuous phase transitions\nfrom an ordered to a disordered state. Those phase transitions occur at a critical value of the temperature Tc (p),\nwhich depends on p. However, for higher disorder densities pc < p \u2264 1, the phase transition becomes first-order.\nOur results show that, in order to model biological, social\nor economic processes on complex networks, it is crucial\nto take into account the character, directed or undirected,\nof the corresponding relational links.\nThe model.- We have studied directed networks in\nd = 1 and 2. For simplicity we focus here on d = 2 and\nfurther results in d = 1 will be published elsewhere. In\norder to construct a directed SW network, we start from\na 2-dimensional square lattice consisting of sites linked\nto their four nearest-neighbours by both, outgoing and\nincoming links. Then, with probability p we reconnect\nnearest-neighbour outgoing links to a different site chosen at random. After repeating this process for every\noutgoing link we are left with a network with a density p\nof SW directed links, as shown in Figure 1. Note that, by\nthis procedure, every site will have exactly four outgoing\nlinks and a varying (random) number of incoming links.\nGeneralization to higher dimensions is straightforward.\nAdopting social network nomenclature, actors are then\nplaced at the network sites. Any given actor is connected\nby four outgoing links to other actors, which we call\nmates. We allow every actor to be in one of two possible\nstates, so that, at any given time, the state of an actor\nis described by a binary spin-like variable si \u2208 {+1, \u22121}.\nDepending on the state of their mates, an actor may\nchange its state according to a majority (ferromagnetic)\nrule: Actors prefer to be in the same state as their mates\nare. In order to implement this, we introduce the pay-off\nfunction\nX\nG(i) = 2si\nsj ,\n(1)\n\nmentioned. On the one hand, the model is nonequilibrium since detailed balance is not satisfied. On the other\nhand, the model is not simply the asymmetric counterpart of the Ising model, since the pay-off function G(i)\nin Eq. (1) does not include the corresponding interaction\nterms coming from the ingoing links (needed in order to\nidentify G(i) with the energy change after a spin update\nin the asymmetric Ising model). In fact, one can easily\nsee that the pay-off function G(i) of our model cannot\nbe written as variation of any Hamiltonian. However,\nwe would like to remark that if only symmetric links are\nallowed, our model becomes exactly equal to the (equilibrium) Ising model in an undirected SW network that was\nstudied in Ref. [14]. This can be seen by a simple comparison of the pay-off function Eq. (1) with the change\nof energy after a spin update in the standard (symmetric) Ising ferromagnet. In this case, it is known that the\nsystem presents mean-field behaviour for any value of the\ndisorder p > 0 [14].\nResults.- We have carried out extensive numerical simulations of the model for different values of the density\nof SW directed ties p and temperature. Our results are\nqualitatively the same for directed networks generated\nfrom regular lattices in d = 1 and 2. In the following we\nfocus on d = 2. We have simulated the model in directed\nSW networks generated from L \u00d7 L square lattices for\nsizes ranging from L = 8 to 100 and different rewiring\nprobabilities p \u2208 [0, 1]. The system is left to evolve until,\nafter some transient, a stationary nonequilibrium state\nis reached. The stationary state can be described by the\nappropriate order parameter, which can be defined in a\nnatural way by means of the 'magnetization' per site\nL\n1 X\nsi .\nm= 2\nL i=1\n2\n\nmates of i\n\n(2)\n\nWe find that the system becomes ordered, i.e. h|m|i 6= 0,\nbelow a critical temperature Tc (p), so that most actors\nare, in average, in the same state. In Figure 2 the average absolute value of the order parameter is plotted\nvs. temperature for two different values of the disorder p = 0.1 and 0.9, calculated in systems of different\nsizes. For every system size L2 , results were averaged\nover both, 10 runs of the dynamics for each network realization and n different realizations of the network, in\nsuch a way that n \u00d7 L2 \u2248 1.5 \u00d7 105 . Figure 2 shows that\nthe order-disorder transition is continuous (top panel) for\na low disorder density, while it becomes discontinuous\nfor a higher concentration of directed SW links (bottom\npanel). A more systematic study of the phase diagram,\nas shown in Figure 3, reveals that there is a line of continuous phase transitions for disorder densities below some\ncritical value pc . Very interestingly, the transition becomes first-order above pc , indicating that there exists a\nnonequilibrium tricritical point at pc . We estimate pc to\n\nwhere the sum is carried out over the four mates of actor i. Note that this pay-off function is positive whenever si points in the same direction as the majority of\nits four mates. External noise is included to allow some\ndegree of randomness in the time evolution by means\nof a temperature-like parameter, T , which we shall call\ntemperature for short from now on. For a given value\nof the external temperature, the update of the model is\nthen performed as follows: At each time step, an actor\n(network site) is randomly chosen and its corresponding pay-off function G(i) is computed according to Eq.\n(1). If G(i) < 0, actor i is opposing its mates' majority and the change si \u2192 \u2212si is accepted. Unfavorable\nchanges, i.e. when G(i) > 0, are accepted with probability exp[\u2212G(i)/T ], which depends on temperature in the\nusual fashion.\nConcerning the physics of the above defined model,\nthere are two interesting points that should be explicitly\n2\n\n\fbe roughly at pc = 0.65(5). The character, continuous or\ndiscontinuous, of the phase transition is better realized\nwhen looking at the probability density function (PDF)\nof the order parameter. For sake of illustration, the insets\nof Fig. 3 show typical PDFs at points of the phase diagram (p,T), all near the critical line. From those PDFs,\none can see that the phase transition is second-order from\nFig. 3a to 3b, in the region p < pc . In contrast, for p > pc\nthe transition is discontinuous, from Fig. 3c to 3d. The\nmost probable values of m, which correspond to the two\nequally highest symmetric peaks in Fig. 3c, become unstable in favor of m = 0 as the transition line is crossed\ntowards Fig. 3d. The transition occurs in such a way\nthat the order parameter exhibits a finite jump at the\ncritical line.\nThe critical behaviour of the model in the region\np < pc , where transitions are continuous, can be studied in detail. We find that the order parameter exhibits\nfinite-size scaling with exponents that depend on the disorder density p. Close to the critical point, |t| \u2192 0, we\nhave h|m|i \u223c |t|\u03b2 , where t = (T \u2212 Tc )/Tc is the reduced\ntemperature. At the critical point, t = 0, the order parameter scales with system size as h|m|i \u223c L\u2212\u03b2/\u03bd , where\n\u03bd is the correlation length exponent. Figure 4 displays\nthe behaviour of h|m|i vs. L for two disorder densities\np = 0.1 and 0.5 below pc \u2248 0.65. Only for T = Tc (p) a\npower-law is obtained and the slope of the straight line\nin a log-log plot gives an estimation of the ratio \u03b2/\u03bd between critical exponents. From Fig. 4 we obtain that\nfor p = 0.1 and p = 0.5, \u03b2/\u03bd = 0.53(2) and 0.40(3),\nrespectively. Moreover, from data collapse analysis (not\nshown) at the corresponding Tc (p) we have \u03b2 = 0.50(3),\n\u03bd = 0.94(6), and \u03b2 = 0.30(3), \u03bd = 0.80(3) for p = 0.1\nand p = 0.5, respectively. These critical exponents are\ndifferent from both mean-field, (\u03b2 = \u03bd = 1/2) and exact\nvalues (\u03b2 = 1/8 and \u03bd = 1) for the Ising model in d = 2.\nConclusions.- Many social, economic and biological\nnetworks in the real world exhibit directed ties or relations. This may be modeled by including directed links in\nthe corresponding complex network model. In addition,\nspin-like models, borrowed from statistical physics, have\nrecently been proposed as toy models to understand some\nsocial processes, like for instance conflict vs. cooperation\namong coalitions [23,24] or formation of cultural domains\n[25]. We claim that the directedness of the network may\nstrongly affect the behaviour of simple processes evolving\non complex networks. We studied the effect of a directed\nsmall-world topology on a very simple spin model. Our\nmodel becomes equal to the Ising model when all links\nare undirected. From numerical simulations we showed\nthat, when directed links exist, the phase diagram of the\nmodel is nontrivial. We found that the system exhibits\ncontinuous phase transitions for disorder densities below\na critical threshold pc \u2248 0.65. For stronger disorder, the\ntransition is first-order. At this stage we can only speculate that the competition among weekly coupled clusters\n\nmay be related to the existence of first-order transitions.\nWe believe that the effect of directed links may be relevant in other types of disordered networks, like free-scale\nnetworks, and different dynamical models. In trying to\nmodel real systems, directed links may play an important\nand unforeseen role.\nAcknowledgement.- We would like to thank J.
