In\naddition to its mathematical richness, it has applications\nranging from molecular biology to freeway traffic.\nA TASEP consists of a chain of length L, with each\nsite being either occupied by a particle or not, on which\nparticles hop from left to right. See Fig. 1. If site i = 1 is\nvacant a particle will enter the system with probability\n\u03b1. If site i = L is occupied the particle will leave the\nsystem with probability \u03b2. In the bulk of the system, a\nparticle on site i will hop to site i + 1 with probably 1 \u2212 p\nprovided i + 1 is vacant, otherwise it remains at site i.\nTASEPs exhibit boundary-induced phase transitions,\ngoverned by the parameters \u03b1, \u03b2 and p. In general, for a\ngiven p, there exist three possible phases, depending on\n\u03b1 and \u03b2: a low-density phase, a high-density phase, and\na maximum-current (or maximum-flow) phase.\n\nFIG. 1: A TASEP with L = 10.\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\u2020 Electronic\n\n1\u2212p\n\naddress: jdgier@unimelb.edu.au\naddress: t.garoni@ms.unimelb.edu.au\n\n\u03b2\n\nIn the context of traffic models, it is most appropriate to update all sites in parallel at each time-step.\nThe stationary distribution of the TASEP with fullyparallel updates [2, 3] is known exactly. (For reviews\nof the stationary properties of TASEPs with random sequential updates see [4, 5].) The Nagel-Schreckenberg\n(NaSch) model [6] is an important generalization of the\nparallel-update TASEP, in which particles can move up\nto vmax \u2208 N sites per time step. The NaSch model is\ngenerally considered to be the minimal model for traffic\non freeways [7]. While many results are known rigorously\nfor the TASEP, our understanding of the NaSch model\nand its further generalizations typically rely on numerical simulation. This is particularly true of traffic network\nmodels, in which the NaSch model is often a component\n(see for example [8\u201310]).\nIn the current article we focus on dynamic\n(auto)correlation functions. The autocorrelations of the\nTASEP with random sequential update have been studied in [11, 12] and display a separation of time scales\nbetween relaxation of local density fluctuations and collective domain wall motion. In particular, it was recently observed [12] that the TASEP with random sequential update exhibits non-trivial oscillations in the\npower spectrum of the system density, in the low and\nhigh density phases. In this article, we further elucidate\nthe nature of these non-trivial oscillations, and demonstrate that they extend to the NaSch model generally.\nWe emphasize that all the simulations performed in this\nwork used fully-parallel updates, including our simulations of TASEP (which we view as the special case of the\nNaSch model with vmax = 1).\n\n\f2\n1.1.\n\nthat \u03c4 = L/v. In section 3 we present numerical results\nthat strongly suggest that in fact, for TASEP, we have\n\nDensity autocorrelations\n\nThe system density, n, which is simply the fraction\nof sites which are occupied, is an important quantity in\nmany applications, including traffic modeling. The relationship between density and flow is known as the fundamental diagram in the traffic engineering literature.\nWhile the stationary-state expectation hni of n is well\nunderstood for the NaSch model, and in fact known rigorously for the TASEP, the dynamic behavior of nt is\nnon-trivial. In this article we numerically study the autocorrelation function \u03c1n (t) := (hn0 nt i \u2212 hni2 )/var(n) of\nthe general NaSch model, and find a very simple form for\nits finite-size scaling. Up to very small corrections, our\nsimulations show that in both the high and low density\nphases we simply have\n(\n1 \u2212 |t|/\u03c4, |t| \u2264 \u03c4,\n\u03c1n (t) =\n(1)\n0,\n|t| \u2265 \u03c4,\nfor some constant \u03c4 \u221d L.\nThe linear decay in (1) is in sharp contrast to the usual\nexponential decay typical of equilibrium systems. In fact,\nas discussed in section 2.2, there are good theoretical reasons to believe that \u03c1n (t) must ultimately decay exponentially on sufficiently long time scales, rather than exhibit\nthe strictly finite support suggested by (1). However, as\ndemonstrated by the simulations in sections 3 and 4, any\ncorrections to the finite-support behavior displayed in (1)\nare extremely weak, and in practice (1) provides a very\naccurate approximation to the behavior of \u03c1n (t) throughout the low and high density phases. In particular, (1)\nprovides a very good approximation to \u03c1n (t) for values\nof p relevant for traffic modeling.\nThe Fourier series of \u03c1n (t) gives the power spectrum of\nn, and we note that taking the Fourier series of (1) does\nindeed produce oscillations as reported in [12]. Indeed,\nwe have\n\u221e\nX\n\nt=\u2212\u221e\n\n\u03c1n (t) ei \u03c9 t =\n\n1 1 \u2212 cos \u03c4 \u03c9\n.\n\u03c4 1 \u2212 cos \u03c9\n\n(2)\n\nThe discussion in [12] focused on the case vmax = 1, with\nrandom sequential updates. However, our simulations\nshow that (1), and hence (2), hold more generally for the\nNaSch model with arbitrary vmax .\nThe specific form (1) of the autocorrelation function\nhas some interesting consequences for the design of Monte\nCarlo simulations. In particular, as discussed in section 2, assuming the validity of (1) we immediately have\n\u03c4 = 2 \u03c4int,n where \u03c4int,n is the integrated autocorrelation\ntime of n. The integrated autocorrelation time can be\ninterpreted loosely as the number of time steps between\n\"effectively independent\" samples. It is therefore reasonable to conjecture that the parameter \u03c4 should equal the\namount of time it takes a fluctuation of the stationary\nstate to traverse the system. If we let v denote the speed\nof such a fluctuation then we might reasonably expect\n\n\u03c4 = L/|vc (\u03b1, \u03b2, p)|\n\n(3)\n\nwhere vc (\u03b1, \u03b2, p), the collective velocity [2, 13], is known\nexactly. The results (1) and (3) are consistent with the\nsuggestions in [12] that the physical origins of the observed oscillations in the power spectrum of n are related\nto the time needed for a fluctuation to traverse the entire\nsystem.\nFurthermore, while no exact expression for\nvc (\u03b1, \u03b2, p, vmax ) is known for the general NaSch model,\nthe simulations presented in section 4 demonstrate that\nthe scaling form (3) extends to general vmax . In addition, in the deterministic limit (p = 0) simple physical\narguments produce an exact relationship between vc and\nvmax which is in excellent agreement with the numerical\nresults.\nThe remainder of this article is organized as follows.\nIn section 2, we briefly review some pertinent general\ntheory relating to autocorrelations and then discuss some\ngeneral consequences of (1). In section 3, we present our\nnumerical evidence supporting (1) and (3) for TASEP,\nand also describe the exact expression for vc (\u03b1, \u03b2, p) in\nthis case. We also explain relationship between (1) and\n(3) and the results presented in [12]. In section 4, we\nbriefly review the definition of the NaSch model before\npresenting our numerical results for \u03c1n (t) in this case.\nFinally, we conclude in section 5 with a discussion.\n2.\n\nAUTOCORRELATIONS\n\nWe begin by briefly recalling some standard definitions\nand results. Consider a Monte Carlo simulation of an\nergodic Markov chain, and assume that sufficient time\nhas passed that the system has reached stationarity. If\none now measures an observable X at each time step\none obtains a stationary time series X1 , X2 , . . . whose\nautocovariance function is defined to be\nCX (t) := hX0 Xt i \u2212 hX0 i2 .\n\n(4)\n\nThe expectation h*i here is with respect to the stationary\ndistribution, and we note that CX (0) = var(X). The\ncorresponding autocorrelation function is then defined as\n\u03c1X (t) :=\n\nCX (t)\n.\nCX (0)\n\n(5)\n\nFinally, assuming CX (t) to be absolutely summable, its\nFourier transform defines the spectral density\nfX (\u03c9) :=\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nCX (t) ei \u03c9 t .\n\n(6)\n\nt=\u2212\u221e\n\nThe spectral density is closely related to the Fourier\ntransform of the time series. Specifically, given any sta-\n\n\f3\ntionary time series X1 , X2 , . . . , XT we can define its discrete Fourier transform to be\nT\n1 X\nb\nX(\u03c9)\n:= \u221a\nXt ei\u03c9t\nT t=1\n\n(7)\n\nwith \u03c9 = 2\u03c0m/T and m = 0, 1, . . . , T \u2212 1. It is then\nstraightforward to show [14] that for large T we have\n\u0012 \u0013\nD\nE\n1\n2\nb\n.\n(8)\n= fX (\u03c9) + O\nX(\u03c9)\nT\n2.1.\n\nExponential Autocorrelation time\n\nTypically, we expect that \u03c1X (t) \u223c exp(\u2212t/\u03c4exp ) as\nt \u2192 \u221e, which defines the exponential autocorrelation\ntime \u03c4exp . More precisely [15], one defines the exponential autocorrelation time of observable X to be\n\u03c4exp,X := lim sup\n|t|\u2192\u221e\n\n\u03c4exp := sup \u03c4exp,X ,\n\nFrom \u03c1X (t) the integrated autocorrelation time is defined [15] as\n\u221e\n1 X\n\u03c1X (t).\n2 t=\u2212\u221e\n\n(9)\n\nIf X denotes the sample mean of X1 , X2 , . . . XT then the\nvariance of X satisfies [15]\nvar(X) \u223c 2 \u03c4int,X\n\nvar(X)\n,\nT\n\nT \u2192 \u221e.\n\n(10)\n\nIt is (10) that accounts for the key role played by the\nintegrated autocorrelation time in the statistical analysis of Markov-chain Monte Carlo time series. If instead\nof a correlated time series, one considers a sequence of\nindependent random variables, then the variance of the\nsample mean is simply var(X)/T . It is in this sense that\n\u03c4int,X determines how many time steps we need to wait\nbetween two \"effectively independent\" samples.\nIt can now be seen immediately from (9) that, as noted\nin the introduction, (1) and (3) imply\n2\u03c4int,n\n\n\u0013\n\u230a\u03c4 \u230b \u0012\nX\n|t|\n1\u2212\n=\n,\n\u03c4\n\n(11)\n\nt=\u2212\u230a\u03c4 \u230b\n\n= \u03c4 + O(\u03c4 \u22121 )\nL\n+ O(L\u22121 ).\n=\n|vc |\n\n(14)\n\n(15)\n\nX\n\nIntegrated Autocorrelation time\n\n\u03c4int,X :=\n\n\u2212|t|\n,\nlog \u03c1X (t)\n\nand then the exponential autocorrelation time of the system as\n\nAutocorrelation times\n\nWe now discuss the implications of the general form\n(1) on two key time scales, the integrated autocorrelation\ntime and the exponential autocorrelation time.\n\n2.1.1.\n\n2.1.2.\n\n(12)\n(13)\n\nEquation (13) provides a very simple exact expression for\n\u03c4int,n in terms of the physical parameters of the model. It\nis quite rare to have such an expression for a non-trivial\nmodel.\n\nwhere the supremum is taken over all observables X.\nThe autocorrelation time \u03c4exp measures the decay rate\nof the slowest mode of the system, and it therefore sets\nthe scale for the number of initial time steps to discard\nfrom a simulation, in order to avoid bias from initial nonstationarity. All observables that are not orthogonal to\nthis slowest mode satisfy \u03c4exp,X = \u03c4exp .\nFor the TASEP in continuous time, \u03c4exp was computed\nanalytically in [16, 17] using the exact Bethe Ansatz solution. In particular, it was found that \u03c4exp is O(1) with\nrespect to L in the high and low density phases. We\nwould expect the same behavior to hold generally for the\nNaSch model.\nHowever, if \u03c1n (t) were to have strictly finite support\nas claimed in (1), then we would have \u2212|t|/ log \u03c1n (t) = 0\nfor all |t| > \u03c4 , implying that \u03c4exp,n 6= \u03c4exp . This would\nthen mean that n is orthogonal to the slowest relaxation\nmode, which seems implausible. We thus conclude that\nalthough (1) provides a very good approximation, \u03c1n (t)\ncannot actually have a strictly finite support.\n\n2.2.\n\nFinite-size scaling of \u03c1n (t)\n\nTo obtain a more precise ansatz for \u03c1n (t) we therefore\nfix some k \u2208 N satisfying k \u2264 \u230a\u03c4 \u230b and set\n\u03c1n (t) =\n\n(\n\n1 \u2212 |t|/\u03c4,\n|t| \u2264 k,\nB e\u2212|t|/\u03c4exp , |t| \u2265 k + 1.\n\n(16)\n\nSince we know empirically that (1) is a very good approximation, it must be the case that k/\u03c4 \u223c 1 as \u03c4 \u2192 \u221e. Let\nus then write \u03c4 = k + \u03b5, where the only assumption we\nmake regarding \u03b5 is that \u03b5/\u03c4 \u2192 0 as \u03c4 \u2192 \u221e. Since\nthe continuum limit of \u03c1(x \u03c4 ) should define a continuous\nfunction of x \u2208 R we choose the parameter B by demanding that 1 \u2212 |t|/\u03c4 = Be\u2212|t|\u03c4exp when |t| = k, which\nyields\n(\n1 \u2212 |t|/\u03c4,\n|t| \u2264 k,\n(17)\n\u03c1n (t) =\n\u2212(|t|\u2212k)/\u03c4exp\n/\u03c4, |t| \u2265 k.\n\u03b5e\n\n\f4\nIt is worth noting that the two expressions (1) and (17)\nlead to the same leading-order expression (13) for \u03c4int,n .\nIndeed, inserting (17) into (9) we obtain\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2\u03b5\n1\n.\n(18)\n2\u03c4int,n = \u03c4 + \u03b5(1 \u2212 \u03b5) + 1/\u03c4\nexp\n\u03c4\ne\n\u22121\nSince (e1/\u03c4exp \u2212 1)\u22121 = O(1) for \u03c4exp = O(1), the terms\narising from the exponential decay of \u03c1n (t) are O(\u03b5) in\nthe low and high density phases.\n3.\n\nTASEP\n\nWe begin this section by comparing the power spectrum found in [12] with the Fourier transform of (1). We\nthen present the exact result for the collective velocity for\nTASEP, before presenting the results of our simulations.\n3.1.\n\nPower spectrum\n\nLet N denote the number of occupied sites in a TASEP\nb (\u03c9) denote the discrete Fourier transsystem, and let N\nform of a particular time series N1 , N2 , . . . , NT , as deb (\u03c9) 2 i is what\nfined in (7). The quantity I(\u03c9) := T h N\n[12] refer to as the power spectrum of N . They find that\nfor the continuous-time TASEP in the low-density phase\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\n2\n3\nL\u03c9\n2v A\nI(\u03c9)\n1 \u2212 e\u2212D\u03c9 L/v cos\n,\n(19)\n\u2248 2\nT\n\u03c9 D\nv\nwhere A, D and v are parameters, which [12] set empirically to v \u2248 0.4, D \u2248 20 and A \u2248 1/500.\nWe now attempt to compare (19) with the corresponding result derived from (1). From (8) we see that\nb (\u03c9) 2 i as T \u2192 \u221e, hence we should compare\nfN (\u03c9) \u223c h N\n(19) with fN (\u03c9) = L2 fn (\u03c9), where fn (\u03c9) is computed\nvia (1). Although our empirical observations of the behavior (1) were made in the discrete time case of fullyparallel updates, (1) can be interpreted as a well defined\ncontinuous function on R. In fact, the fully-parallel update rule becomes equivalent to the random sequential\nupdate in the limit \u03b5 \u2192 0 of rescaled variables 1 \u2212 p = \u03b5,\n\u03b1 = \u03b1\u0303\u03b5 and \u03b2 = \u03b2\u0303\u03b5. Here, \u03b1\u0303 and \u03b2\u0303 are the usual injection\nand extraction rates of the TASEP in continuous time.\nTo compare with the continuous time result (19), we\ncompute fn (\u03c9) via the continuous-time Fourier transform, so that (1) and (3) predict\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0012\n2 |vc |\nL\u03c9\nfN (\u03c9) =\n.\n(20)\nvar(n) L 1 \u2212 cos\n\u03c92\n|vc |\nNow, since \u03c9 = 2\u03c0m/T , for sufficiently large T we have\nexp(D\u03c9 2 L/v 3 ) \u2248 1. This is exactly the regime used\nby [12] in their Fig. 3 (L = 1000 or L = 32000 and\nT = 106 ). Therefore, in this regime we can identify (19)\nwith (20) if v = |vc | and\nA\n= var(n) L.\nD\n\n(21)\n\nSome remarks are in order. Firstly, for the deterministic (p = 0) parallel-update TASEP, the static variance\nvar(n) can be computed analytically from the known results for the two-point function [3]. In the low density\nphase it is given by\nvar(n) =\n\n\u03b1(1 \u2212 \u03b1) 1\n+ O(L\u22122 ),\n(1 + \u03b1)3 L\n\n(22)\n\nand for the high density region \u03b1 is replaced by \u03b2. We\nexpect that var(n) = O(1/L) would remain true when\np > 0, and indeed for vmax > 1 as well. In general,\ntherefore, we expect the prefactor in (20) to be O(1) in\nL.\nFinally, we note that [12] fit (19) to their data with\na very small value of A/D. This small value follows\nfrom the fact that the numerical simulations in [12] were\nperformed along the mean field line of the TASEP with\nrandom sequential update, where, theoretically, var(n) is\nidentically zero. It is surprising that [12] were still able\nto extract a meaningful signal on this line.\n\n3.2.\n\nCollective velocity\n\nThe stationary distribution of the TASEP with fullyparallel updates [2, 3] is known exactly. In particular, if\n\u221a\n\u03b1 < \u03b2, 1\u2212 p such TASEPs reside in a low-density phase,\n\u221a\nwhile for \u03b2 < \u03b1, 1 \u2212 p a high-density phase results, with\n\u221a\n\u03b1 = \u03b2 < 1 \u2212 p defining a coexistence line of the two\nphases (corresponding to a first order phase transition).\n\u221a\nFor \u03b1, \u03b2 > 1 \u2212 p by contrast, the system resides in a\nmaximum-current phase, in which the density is precisely\n1/2.\nThe collective velocity [13] is the drift of the center of\nmass of a momentary local fluctuation of the stationary\nstate, and is related to the current (flow) J and bulk\ndensity \u03c1b via vc = \u2202J(\u03c1b )/\u2202\u03c1b . An exact expression for\nvc (\u03b1, \u03b2, p) is available [2] for the case of parallel-update\nTASEP. If we define, for convenience, the function\n(1 \u2212 p)((1 \u2212 x)2 \u2212 p)\n,\n(1 \u2212 x)2 + p(2x \u2212 1)\n\n(23)\n\ng(\u03b1, p),\nlow density phase,\n\u2212g(\u03b2, p), high density phase.\n\n(24)\n\ng(x, p) =\nthen\nvc (\u03b1, \u03b2, p) =\n\n(\n\nThe negativity of the collective velocity in the highdensity phase is simply due to the fact that it is the propagation of holes from right to left, rather than of particles\nfrom left to right, that is important in this phase.\nUsing these exact expressions for vc the expression (3)\nnow becomes\n(\n\u221a\nL/g(\u03b1, p), \u03b1 < \u03b2, 1 \u2212 p,\n\u03c4=\n(25)\n\u221a\nL/g(\u03b2, p), \u03b2 < \u03b1, 1 \u2212 p.\n\n\f5\nWe note that for p = 0 we have |vc | = 1 identically\nthroughout the high and low density regimes so that we\nsimply have \u03c4 = L in this case. We also note that in\nthe low-density (high-density) phase \u03c4 is independent of\n\u03b2 (\u03b1).\n\ncluding the fundamental diagram) have cusps at p = 0\nwhich are smoothed out for p > 0.\n1\n\nL = 1000, p = 0.25, \u03b1 = 0.10, \u03b2 = 0.20\nL = 1000, p = 0.25, \u03b1 = 0.15, \u03b2 = 0.90\nL = 1000, p = 0.25, \u03b1 = 0.40, \u03b2 = 0.05\nL = 1000, p = 0.25, \u03b1 = 0.80, \u03b2 = 0.20\nL = 5000, p = 0.25, \u03b1 = 0.10, \u03b2 = 0.20\nL = 5000, p = 0.25, \u03b1 = 0.15, \u03b2 = 0.90\nL = 5000, p = 0.25, \u03b1 = 0.40, \u03b2 = 0.05\nL = 5000, p = 0.25, \u03b1 = 0.80, \u03b2 = 0.20\nL = 10000, p = 0.25, \u03b1 = 0.10, \u03b2 = 0.20\nL = 10000, p = 0.25, \u03b1 = 0.15, \u03b2 = 0.90\nL = 10000, p = 0.25, \u03b1 = 0.40, \u03b2 = 0.05\nL = 10000, p = 0.25, \u03b1 = 0.80, \u03b2 = 0.20\n\n0.8\n\nSimulations\n\n0.6\n\nWe now turn our attention to our Monte Carlo simulations. We simulated the parallel-update TASEP at a\nvariety of values of \u03b1, \u03b2 and p corresponding to both the\nlow and high density phases, for system sizes L = 103 ,\n5 \u00d7 103 and 104 . Each simulation consisted of 104 L/vc\niterations, with the first 103 L/vc time-steps discarded\nto ensure negligible bias due to initial non-stationarity\n(initially the system was empty). Assuming the validity\nof (3), this implies we generated 1.8 \u00d7 104 \u03c4int,n samples\nof the stationary distribution in each simulation.\nFor each simulation, we measured n at each iteration,\nand from the resulting time series we estimated the autocorrelation function \u03c1n (t) using the standard estimators [15]. Fig. 2 shows a finite-size scaling plot of \u03c1n (t)\nassuming the ansatz given by (1) with \u03c4 = L, in the p = 0\ncase. The agreement is clearly very good, and the sharpness of the cusp at t = L suggests that any corrections\nto the finite-support ansatz (1) are very small.\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0\n0\n\n0.5\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\nFIG. 3: Color online.

Although the precise form of the phase diagram\ndepends on vmax , the NaSch model exhibits, in general, the same three qualitatively distinct phases as the\nTASEP [21]. We now briefly review the dynamical rules\ndefining the NaSch model. Suppose at time t \u2208 N a\nvehicle with speed vt \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , vmax } is located on\nsite xt , and has headway (number of empty sites to its\n\n\f6\n\n4.1.\n\nSimulations\n\nWe now describe our simulations of the NaSch model\nas defined above. To our knowledge, no rigorous results\nare known for vc when vmax > 1. However, for the deterministic case (p = 0) we expect that\n(\nvmax , low density phase,\nvc =\n(26)\n\u22121,\nhigh density phase,\nfor any vmax , since in the low-density phase the deterministic movement of vehicles from left to right should\ncontrol the dynamics, while in the high-density phase we\nexpect that it is the movement of holes (traveling with\nspeed 1) from right to left which is important. More generally, we expect the form (24) to remain valid, but with\nan unknown function g, that will in general depend on\nvmax .\n\nFig. 5 presents a finite-size scaling plot of \u03c1n (t) obtained by simulating the NaSch model with vmax = 3\nand p = 0, with system sizes L = 103 , 5 \u00d7 103 and 104\nand a variety of values of \u03b1, \u03b2 corresponding to both the\nlow and high density phases. The data collapse is excellent, providing strong evidence for the ansatz obtained\nfrom (1), (3), and (26). As for the case of p = 0 when\nvmax = 1 we note the sharpness of the cusp at t = L/|vc |,\nagain suggesting that any corrections to the ansatz (1)\nare very small. Each simulation performed consisted of\n1\n\nL = 1000, p = 0, \u03b1 = 0.25, \u03b2 = 0.50\nL = 1000, p = 0, \u03b1 = 0.50, \u03b2 = 0.25\nL = 1000, p = 0, \u03b1 = 0.50, \u03b2 = 0.75\nL = 1000, p = 0, \u03b1 = 0.75, \u03b2 = 0.50\nL = 5000, p = 0, \u03b1 = 0.25, \u03b2 = 0.50\nL = 5000, p = 0, \u03b1 = 0.50, \u03b2 = 0.25\nL = 5000, p = 0, \u03b1 = 0.50, \u03b2 = 0.75\nL = 5000, p = 0, \u03b1 = 0.75, \u03b2 = 0.50\nL = 10000, p = 0, \u03b1 = 0.25, \u03b2 = 0.50\nL = 10000, p = 0, \u03b1 = 0.50, \u03b2 = 0.25\nL = 10000, p = 0, \u03b1 = 0.50, \u03b2 = 0.75\nL = 10000, p = 0, \u03b1 = 0.75, \u03b2 = 0.50\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n\u03c1n(t)\n\nright) equal to ht . Then the maximum speed this vehicle\ncan safely achieve at the next time step is taken to be\nvsafe = min(vt + 1, vmax , ht ), which allows for unit acceleration provided the speed limit is obeyed and crashes\nare avoided. Provided vsafe > 0, a random deceleration\nis then applied so that with probability p the new speed\nis vt+1 = vsafe \u2212 1, otherwise vt+1 = vsafe . Finally, in\nthe bulk of the system, the vehicle hops vt+1 sites to its\nright, so that xt+1 = xt + vt+1 . All vehicles in the bulk\nof the system are updated in this way in parallel. The\nbulk dynamics clearly reduces to parallel-update TASEP\nwhen vmax = 1.\nIt remains to consider the boundary dynamics. We\nagain wish to apply open boundary conditions, however\nchoosing an appropriate implementation of such boundary conditions for the NaSch model is actually surprisingly subtle, and has been an active topic of research\nover recent years [18\u201323]. In particular, it was argued\nin [21] that in order to observe the maximum-current\nphase when vmax > 1 one needs to implement the inflow\nof vehicles into the system in a rather careful manner.\nSince our interest in the present context is confined to\nthe high and low density phases however, we have chosen\nto implement the boundary conditions in the following\nsimple way. We augment the system, which has sites 1 \u2264\ni \u2264 L, with two boundary sites; one at i = 0 and another\nat i = L + 1. With probability \u03b1 a vehicle with speed\nvmax is inserted on site 0, and we immediately compute\nvsafe for this vehicle. If vsafe > 0 we move the vehicle to\nsite vsafe otherwise we delete it. The output is performed\nsimilarly. With probability 1 \u2212 \u03b2 we insert a vehicle on\nsite L+1, which then acts as a blockage to vehicles exiting\nthe system. If the rightmost vehicle in the system has\nxt \u2265 L \u2212 vmax we define its new speed to be vsafe and\nattempt to move the vehicle to site xt+1 = xt + vsafe . If\nxt+1 > L the vehicle is removed from the system. When\nvmax = 1 the above prescription reduces to the boundary\nrules for the simple TASEP described in section 1.\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n| vc | t 6 L\n\nFIG. 5: Color online.

The above simulations\nwere also performed for vmax = 5 with identical results.\nFinally, we also considered the case of vmax = 3 with\np = 0.25. For vmax > 1 and p > 0 we are not aware of\nany exact predictions for vc , however it seems reasonable\nto conjecture that vc is independent of \u03b2 (\u03b1) in the low\n(high) density phase. We therefore simulated the NaSch\nmodel with vmax = 3, p = 0.25 and \u03b1 = 0.25 at four\ndifferent values of \u03b2 > \u03b1, which should then correspond\nto a single value of vc . By considering a single value of\nvc we can still use a finite-size scaling plot of \u03c1n (t) to\ntest the conjectures (1) and (3). Fig. 6 provides strong\nevidence to support their validity at vmax > 1 and p > 0.\nBy varying the value of |vc | used to produce the scaling\nplot of \u03c1n (t) so that the support edge lay at |vc |t/L = 1\nwe obtained vc \u2248 2.65. We remark that, assuming the\nvalidity of (1) and (3), this method can be used as a way\nto obtain approximate values of |vc | when vmax > 1 and\np > 0.\n\n5.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nWe have studied the NaSch model in the low and high\ndensity phases via Monte Carlo simulation, and found\nthat to a very good approximation the autocorrelation\n\n\f7\n1\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n\u03c1n(t)\n\nfunction for the system density behaves as 1 \u2212 |vc t|/L\nwith a finite support [\u2212L/|vc |, L/|vc |], where vc is the\ncollective velocity. For the case of vmax = 1 an exact\ntheoretical result is known for vc for all p \u2208 [0, 1]. When\nvmax > 1 no rigorous results for vc are known, however we\nconjecture that the when p = 0 we simply have vc = vmax\nin the low-density phase and vc = \u22121 in the high-density\nphase. This result agrees with the exact result in the\nspecial case of vmax = 1 and with numerical simulations\nfor vmax = 3, 5. It seems reasonable to expect that it is\nvalid for all vmax for the deterministic NaSch model.\n\nL = 1000, p = 0.25, \u03b1 = 0.25, \u03b2 = 0.60\nL = 1000, p = 0.25, \u03b1 = 0.25, \u03b2 = 0.70\nL = 1000, p = 0.25, \u03b1 = 0.25, \u03b2 = 0.80\nL = 1000, p = 0.25, \u03b1 = 0.25, \u03b2 = 0.90\nL = 5000, p = 0.25, \u03b1 = 0.25, \u03b2 = 0.60\nL = 5000, p = 0.25, \u03b1 = 0.25, \u03b2 = 0.70\nL = 5000, p = 0.25, \u03b1 = 0.25, \u03b2 = 0.80\nL = 5000, p = 0.25, \u03b1 = 0.25, \u03b2 = 0.90\nL = 10000, p = 0.25, \u03b1 = 0.25, \u03b2 = 0.60\nL = 10000, p = 0.25, \u03b1 = 0.25, \u03b2 = 0.70\nL = 10000, p = 0.25, \u03b1 = 0.25, \u03b2 = 0.80\nL = 10000, p = 0.25, \u03b1 = 0.25, \u03b2 = 0.90\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n| vc | t 6 L\n\nFIG. 6: Color online.
