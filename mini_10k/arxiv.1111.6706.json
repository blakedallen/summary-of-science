INTRODUCTION\nThe discovery of superconductivity in the iron based superconductors RFeAsO1-xFx (R =\nLa, Sm, Ce, Nd, Pr and Gd ) and AFe2-xCoxAs2 (A = Ca, Sr and Ba) [1-6] with transition\ntemperature up to 55K has generated enormous interest to investigate these materials both\ntheoretically and experimentally. The parent compounds LaFeAsO and AFe2As2 (termed\nas so called \"1111\" and \"122\" systems, respectively) exhibit long range\nantiferromagnetic (AFM) order akin to cuprates which is suppressed on doping [7-8].\nThere are a numbers of different scenarios proposed for the possible superconducting\npairing mechanism in these iron pnictides [9-13], including the importance of AFM spin\nfluctuation and electron-phonon coupling through spin-channels. Recently, inverse iron\nisotope effect has been observed in 122 systems, suggesting an exotic coupling\nmechanism in these superconductors involving phonons [13].\nOne of the most important quantities for understanding the pairing mechanism in high\ntemperature superconductors is the superconducting gap (2\u2206), whose magnitude and\nstructure are intimately linked to the pairing mechanism. Raman spectroscopy has been\nproved to be a powerful technique to investigate the superconductivity-induced phonon\nrenormalization in high Tc superconductors as well as phonon anomalies well above Tc\n[14-19]. A few temperature-dependent Raman studies have been reported on these iron\nbased superconductors for \"1111\" [18, 20-21], \"122\" [22-26] and \"11\" (FeSe1-x) [27]\nsystems. In case of Sr1-xKxFe2As2 [22] no phonon anomaly was seen as a function of\ntemperature. However, in another study of R1-xKxFe2As2 (R= Ba, Sr) [24] the linewidths\nof the phonon modes involving Fe and As near 185 cm-1 ( A1g ) and 210 cm-1 ( B1g ) show\na decrease below the spin-density-wave transition temperature Ts ~ 150 K, attributed to\n\n2\n\n\fspin-density gap opening. Also, the frequency of the 185 cm-1 mode shows a\ndiscontinuous change at Ts, signaling first order structural transition accompanying the\nspin-density-wave transition at Ts. Similar results for the B1g mode ( near 210 cm-1) are\nseen for\n\nSr0.85K0.15Fe2As2 and Ba0.72K0.28Fe2As2 (Ts ~ 140 K) [26]. In the parent\n\ncompound CaFe2As2, the B1g phonon frequency ( 210 cm-1) shows a discontinuous\ndecrease at Ts ~ 173 K and the A1g phonon ( near 190 cm-1 ) intensity is zero above Ts ,\nattributed to the first order structural phase transition and a drastic change of charge\ndistribution within the FeAs plane [23]. The Eg (Fe, As) phonon (~ 135 cm-1 ) in Ba(Fe1xCox)2As2\n\n( x < 0.06) splits into two modes near the structural transition temperature ( Ts\n\n~ 100 to 130 K) linked to strong spin-phonon coupling [25]. Similarly, Eg ( ~ 100 cm-1)\nmode in case of FeSe0.82 associated with the Se vibrations in ab plane shows anomalous\nhardening below Ts attributed to the strong spin-phonon coupling [27-28].\nHowever, there are no detailed temperature-dependent Raman studies on electron-doped\nCaFe2As2. In this paper we report such a study of single crystals of Ca(Fe0.95Co0.05)2As2\nwith Tc ~ 23 K [29-30] in the temperature range of 4 K to 300 K covering the spectral\nrange from 120 cm-1 to 800 cm-1. There are two motivating factors behind this work:\nfirst, Raman study of phonons can provide information on the superconducting state\nthrough superconductivity induced phonon renormalization. Second, influence on the\nphonon self-energy by other quasi-particles excitations, e.g spin-waves, can be probed as\nhighlighted in the recent experimental and theoretical studies of these materials. Here,\nfrom temperature-dependent Raman scattering in tetragonal Ca(Fe0.95Co0.05)2As2, we\npresent two significant results: (i) we find a strong evidence for the superconductivityinduced phonon renormalization, in particular a phonon mode near 260 cm-1 shows\n\n3\n\n\fanomalous hardening below Tc attributed to an opening of the superconducting gap; (ii)\nwe find evidence for the spin-phonon coupling below the magnetic transition temperature\naccompanied by the tetragonal-to-orthorhombic structural transition in the doped\nsuperconducting system.\n2. METHODS\n2.1 Experimental Details\nSingle crystals of nominal composition Ca(Fe0.95Co0.05)2As2 with a superconducting\ntransition temperature Tc ~ 23 K were prepared and characterized as described in ref. 2930. Unpolarised micro-Raman measurements (with spectrum resolution ~ 4 cm-1) were\nperformed in backscattering geometry, using 514.5 nm line of an Ar-ion Laser (Coherent\nInnova 300) and Raman spectrometer (DILOR XY) coupled to a liquid nitrogen cooled\nCCD detector. The crystal surface facing the incident radiation is ab plane. Temperature\nvariation was taken from 4 K to 300 K, with a temperature accuracy of \u00b1 0.1K, using\ncontinuous flow He cryostat (Oxford Instrument).\n2.2 Computational Details\nOur first-principles calculations are based on density functional theory as implemented in\nthe PWSCF [31] package. We use optimized norm-conserving pseudopotential [32] for\nCa, As and ultrasoft pseudopotentials [33] for Co and Fe to describe the interaction\nbetween ionic cores and valence electrons, and a local density approximation (LDA) of\nthe exchange energy functional. We use plane wave basis with a kinetic energy cutoff of\n40 Ry in representation of wavefunctions and a cutoff of 240 Ry in representation of the\ncharge density. We sampled integration over the Brillouin zone (of single unit cell) with\n12x12x8 Monkhorst Pack Mesh [34]. Structural optimizations of CaFe2As2 and\n\n4\n\n\fCa(Fe1-xCox)2As2 are done with\n\n2 x 2 x1 supercells by minimizing the total energy\n\nusing Hellman-Feynman forces and the Broyden-Flecher-Goldfarb-Shanno based\nmethod. Zone center (q = 0, 0, 0) phonon spectra are determined using a frozen phonon\nmethod (with atomic displacements of \u00b1 0.04 \u00c5) for the relaxed structure obtained at\nexperimental values of the lattice constants. Self-consistent solution with different\nmagnetic ordering, particularly ferromagnetic (FM) and G-antiferromagnetic types\n(AFM1), was rather demanding and was achieved with a mixing of charge density based\non local density dependent Thomas-Fermi screening and a mixing factor of 0.1 (density\nfrom the new iteration with weight of 0.1). To facilitate comparison between theory and\nexperiment within the accuracy of calculational framework and estimate the errors\nassociated with use of pseudopotentials, we repeated all calculations for x=0 with\nprojector augmented wave potentials as implemented in a plane-wave package VASP\n[35-36]. Zone centre phonons were determined using frozen phonon method for\nstructures obtained after internal relaxation for each of the nonmagnetic (NM), FM,\nAFM1 and stripe anti-ferromagnetic (AFM2) orderings.\n3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS\n3.1. Raman Scattering from Phonons\nCaFe2As2 has a layered structure belonging to the tetragonal I4/mmm space group. There\nare four Raman active modes belonging to the irreducible representation A1g (As) + B1g\n(Fe) +2Eg (As and Fe) [23]. Figure 1 shows Raman spectrum at 4 K, revealing 3 modes\nlabeled as S1 (205 cm-1), S2 (215 cm-1) and S3 (267 cm-1). Spectra are fitted to a sum of\nLorentzian functions. The individual modes are shown by thin lines and the resultant fit\nby thick line. Before we discuss assignment of modes S1 to S3 as phonon modes, we\n\n5\n\n\freview the assignment of the Raman modes calculated and experimentally observed so\nfar in \"122\" systems [22-26, 37]. In Sr1-xKxFe2As2 (x = 0, 0.4), the four Raman active\nmodes have been observed and assigned as 114 cm-1 (Eg : As and Fe), 182 cm-1 (A1g :\nAs), 204 cm-1 (B1g : Fe) and 264 cm-1 (Eg : As and Fe) [22]. The two modes observed in\nCaFe2As2 [23] are 189 cm-1 (A1g : As) and 211 cm-1 (B1g : Fe). In Ba(Fe1-xCox)2As2\nsystem, three observed modes have been assigned as 124 cm-1 (Eg : As and Fe), 209 cm-1\n(B1g : Fe) and 264 cm-1 (Eg : As and Fe) [25]. In R1-xKxFe2As2 (R = Ba, Sr), four Raman\nactive modes have been identified as 117 cm-1 (Eg : As and Fe), 189 cm-1(A1g : As), 206\ncm-1 (B1g : Fe) and 268 cm-1 (Eg : As and Fe) [24]. However in another Raman study of\nR1-xKxFe2As2 (R = Ba, Sr) only one mode was observed and assigned as 210 cm-1 (B1g :\nFe) [26]. In a theoretical calculation by Hou et al [37] for SrFe2As2 the four calculated\nRaman modes in non-magnetic state are 138.9 cm-1 (Eg : As and Fe); 207.6 cm-1 (A1g :\nAs); 219.5 cm-1 (B1g : Fe) and 301.2 cm-1 (Eg : As and Fe). The phonon frequencies for\nBaFe2As2 are close to the values for SrFe2As2. Keeping these reports in view and our\ndensity functional calculations (see Table II, III and fig. 2), we assign the modes S1 to S3\nas S1: 205 cm-1 (B1g : Fe), S2 : 215 cm-1 (A1g : As) and S3: 267 cm-1 ( Eg : Fe and As). We\nnote from figure 1 that the linewidth of the mode S3 is larger than that of S1 and S2\nmodes. It is likely that the large linewidth of S3 (with eigen vectors in a-b plane) may\narise from the disorder caused by the slight rotation of a-b plane in these layered crystals.\n3.2. Temperature Dependence of the Phonon Frequencies\nFigure 3 shows the peak frequency and linewidths of the three phonon modes as a\nfunction of temperature. The solid lines are linear fits to the data in a given temperature\nwindow. The following observations can be made: (i) The temperature dependence of\n\n6\n\n\fthe frequency of mode S1 shows a discontinuous change at TSM. The frequency of the\nmode has anomalous temperature dependence below TSM (i.e the frequency decreases\nwith lowering of the temperature). (ii) The temperature dependence of the mode S2 is\nanomalous in the entire temperature range of 4 K to 300 K. (iii) The frequency of the\nmode S3 also shows anomalous temperature dependence between Tc and 300 K. Below\nTc, the mode hardens on decreasing the temperature. (iv) The linewidths of mode S1 and\nS2 remains nearly constant with temperature, but on the other hand, the linewidth of\nmode S3 shows non-monotonic dependence on temperature below TSM.\nIn superconductors, the opening of the superconducting gap (2\u2206) below Tc redistributes\nthe electronic states in the neighborhood of the Fermi-surface and hence can change the\nphonon self-energy as seen in cuprates and other high temperature superconductors [1419]. According to Zeyer et al [38] a change in phonon self-energy below Tc is linked with\nthe interaction of the phonons with the superconducting quasi-particles. Qualitatively,\nbased on mode repulsion coupled excitation model, phonons above the 2\u2206 show\nhardening below Tc whereas the phonons with frequency below the gap value can soften\n[38]. The anomalous hardening of mode S3 below Tc (shown in Fig. 3) indicates a\ncoupling of this phonon of Eg symmetry involving the vibrations of Fe and As atoms to\nthe electronic system. A microscopic understanding of this coupling may help in\nunderstanding the symmetry of the superconducting gap. Taking the phonon frequency of\nS3 mode as an upper limit of 2\u2206, an estimate of 2\u2206/kBTc is ~ 15, pointing to strongcoupling nature of superconductor. We note that in \"122\" systems experimental\nevidences of single and multiple gaps have already been reported from infrared\nspectroscopy [39], angle resolved spectroscopy [40-41], nuclear magnetic resonance [42-\n\n7\n\n\f43] and muon spin rotation [44]. The reported gap values show a large variation from\n2\u2206/kBTc ~ 1.6 to 10 in both electron-doped [39, 41, 44] and hole-doped systems [40, 4243]. The origin of this large spread is still not understood.\nThe anomalous softening of the modes with decreasing temperature for all the three\nmodes might be attributed to strong spin-phonon coupling, in line with other studies for\nsimilar pnictide systems. A recent study on the isotope effect in iron-pnictide '122'\nsuperconductors [45] suggests that electron-phonon interaction do play a role in the\nsuperconducting pairing mechanism via strong spin-phonon coupling. The coupling\nbetween phonons and spin degrees of freedom can arise either due to modulation of\nexchange integral by phonon amplitude [46-47] and/or by involving change in the Fermi\nsurface by spin-waves provided phonon couples to that part of the Fermi surface [17].\nEarlier Raman [24-25, 27] and neutron scattering studies [48-49] in iron-pnictides have\nalso indicated strong spin-phonon coupling and have been supported by earlier theoretical\ncalculation [12, 28, and 37]. In order to further elucidate the importance of strong spinphonon coupling also in the present case of Ca(Fe0.95Co0.05)2As2, we performed detailed\nDFT calculations.\n3.3. Theoretical Calculations\nWe now present results of density functional theory based calculations to understand the\nrole of magnetic ordering on phonons. To find out which magnetic ordering is relevant in\nthe ground state at low temperatures, we carried out self-consistent total energy\ncalculations for non-magnetic (NM) as well as different magnetic orderings i.e. FM,\nAFM1 and AFM2. Within Local spin density approximation (LSDA), our calculations\ninitialized with FM, AFM1 and AFM2 type antiferromagnetic orderings relax to a\n\n8\n\n\fnonmagnetic structure at the self-consistency. However, local stability of these\nmagnetically ordered states could be achieved through use of an onsite correlation\n(Hubbard) parameter U ( = 4eV for Fe atoms) in the LSDA+U formalism. Calculated\ntotal energies of different magnetic orderings within LSDA+U description show that the\nstripe antiferromagnetic ordering has lowest energy (see Table I) and it should be\nprominent at low temperatures. We note a weak shear stress \u03c3xy appearing in the stripe\nphase (Table I), which should give rise to a small orthorhombic strain as the secondary\norder parameter below TSM.\nTo estimate the strength of spin-phonon coupling, if any, we determined phonon\nfrequencies at wave-vector q = (0, 0, 0) using frozen phonon method for both the NM and\nstripe antiferromagnetic ordering (AFM2). Effects of spin-ordering on phonons are\nreflected in the frequencies of these two phases (see Table II). We find that the\nfrequencies change by a large amount from NM phase to AFM2 phase (changes are of\nthe order of 20-40 cm-1), indicating the presence of a strong spin-phonon coupling in pure\nas well as doped CaFe2As2 systems. Calculated Raman active phonon modes are in\nreasonable agreement with the observed values (see Table II). We find that frequencies of\nthe three Raman active modes estimated for a state with AFM2 ordering are smaller than\nthose estimated for the NM ordering at both the compositions x = 0 and x = 0.25 studied\nhere (see Table II). To estimate the spin-phonon couplings relevant to observed Raman\nspectra, we determined zone centre phonons for relaxed structures (kept at the\nexperimental lattice constant) with AFM1, AFM2, FM and NM ordering (see Table III).\nIt is evident from the frequencies that the spin-phonon coupling for all the three modes is\nstrong. To understand the temperature dependence of phonon frequencies arising from\nthe spin-phonon coupling, (\u03bb(1)u2*SiSj, u being phonon coordinate and Si the spin on ith\nFe) we construct a simple Ising spin-Hamiltonian [28] H = J1 \u2211 Si .S j + J 2\nNN\n\n\u2211 S .S\ni\n\nj\n\n, where\n\n2nd NN\n\nJ1 and J2 are the nearest and next nearest neighbor exchange interaction parameters. We\nnote that though Heisenberg-type model should be used to capture the spin dynamics of\ncomplex systems such as Fe-based superconductors, it has been shown theoretically [50]\n\n9\n\n\fthat ground states of these systems have collinear stripe type anti-ferromagnetic spin\nordering and for such systems Heisenberg and Ising models should give similar results.\nWe use Monte Carlo (MC) simulations to obtain T-dependent spin-ordering. J1 and J2 are\nestimated from the energies of states with different magnetic ordering (see Table I) of\nCaFe2As2: J1 = -9 meV and J2 = 19 meV. The temperature dependence of the nearest and\nnext nearest neighbor spin-spin correlations, obtained from MC simulations (see Fig. 4),\nbears a monotonous decrease with reducing temperature below room temperature. Given\nthat the modes S1, S2 and S3 couple similarly to spin (see Table III) with the highest\nvalue of frequency in the NM state and the lowest one in stripe phase (AFM2), all the\nthree Raman-active modes should soften as the temperature is lowered; the T-dependence\nof S2 mode is expected to be weaker because its coupling with spin is much smaller. This\nis consistent with our data in figure 3 where changes in the frequency below TSM are\nminimum for the S2 mode. These theoretical predictions are consistent with the observed\nsoftening of Raman modes at low temperature in our experiment. Secondly, the precise\nmagnetic ordering in the low-temperature phase is mixed as reflected in low temperature\nvalues of the spin-spin correlation (Fig. 4), which should have been 0 and -1 for the first\nand second neighbor spin-correlations in the stripe phase. We suggest that the low\ntemperature phase of CaFe2As2 is partially stripe anti-ferromagnetic and it is due to\nfrustration coming from opposite signs of first and second neighbor exchange interactions\nbetween Fe. With decrease in temperature, we believe that the system undergoes a\nmagnetic transition from paramagnetic to short-ranged AFM2 ~ 140 K [30] and\nsoftening of Raman active modes at the low temperatures is due to the spin-phonon\ncoupling which remains strong as a function of x. This is understandable because such a\ncoupling arises from the changes in the Fe-As-Fe bond angles (subsequently the superexchange interactions) associated with atomic displacements (see Fig. 2) in S1 and S2\nmodes.\n\n4. CONCLUSIONS\nIn conclusion, we have shown that all the three observed modes show anomalous\ntemperature-dependence due to strong spin-phonon coupling in Ca(Fe0.95Co0.05)2As2.\n\n10\n\n\fDensity functional calculations of phonons in different magnetic phases show strong\nspin-phonon coupling in parent and doped (122) system which is responsible for the\nobserved softening of the phonon frequency with decreasing temperature. The anomalous\nhardening of one of the Raman active mode below the superconducting transition\ntemperature is attributed to the coupling of the mode with the superconducting quasiparticle excitations, yielding an upper limit of 2\u2206/kBTc ~ 15. Results obtained here suggest\nthat the interplay between phonons and spin degrees of freedom are crucial to unravel the\nunderlying physics responsible for the pairing mechanism in iron-pnictides.\n\nAcknowledgments\nPK, AB and AK acknowledge CSIR, India, for research fellowship.
