Introduction. V.Fedorchuk posed a general problem concerning geometric properties\nof functors, that is, how functors affect certain geometric properties of spaces and mappings\nbetween them [11]. Under geometric properties we understand the property of being an AR\nfor a space, the properties of being soft or a Tychonov fibering for a mapping etc.\nThere were many investigations in this direction involving such functors as the hyperspace\nfunctor exp, the probability measures functor P , the superextension functor \u03bb, the inclusion\nhyperspace functor G and others (see, e.g. [10] or [11]).\nLet us now consider as an example the functors of probability measures P and superextension \u03bb. There is a natural structure of linear convexity on P (X). As for \u03bb, de Groot constructed\nsome abstract convexity (not linear) on any space of the form \u03bb(X) (see [12]), and this convexity\nis binary, whereas the linear convexity on P (X) is not.\n1\n\n\fThe functors \u03bb and P differ in their geometric properties as well. Consider the property of\nbeing an AR, for instance. In the metrizable case, \u03bb(X) \u2208 AR if and only if X is a continuum,\nand P (X) is an absolute retract for each compactum X. When X is not metrizable, the\nspace P (X) can be AR only in case X is openly generated and of weight \u2264 \u03c91 . As for the\nsuperextension functor, \u03bb(X) \u2208 AR whenever X is an openly generated continuum, without\nlimitations on weight.\nThe algebraic aspects of functors are formalized by the notion of a monad in the sense of\nEilenberg and Moore [13].\nThe notion of convexity considered in this paper is considerably broader than the classic\none: specifically, it is not restricted to the context of linear spaces. Such convexities appeared\nin the process of studying different structures like partially ordered sets, semilattices, lattices,\nsuperextensions etc. We base our approach on the notion of topological convexity from [14]\nwhere the general convexity theory is covered from axioms to application in different areas.\nT.Radul assigned to each monad F some abstract convexity structure on every space F X, where\nF is the functorial part of the monad F. Some additional conditions on these monads (that\nthey are L-monads which weakly preserve preimages) guarantee that the considered convexities\ngenerate the topology of the space F X for the functor F included in an L-monad. It was shown\nthat L-monads which weakly preserve preimages and with binary convexities can give absolute\nretracts in all weights [3]. Also, the morphisms of their algebras can be soft in nonmetrizable\ncase under certain conditions. Note that the property of binarity of the convexity generated by\nmonad F is equivalent to the superextension monad being the submonad of F (again [3]).\nIn this article we consider functors OS and OH (introduced in [5], [6]), which both generate\nL-monads. The monad OS does not generate binary convexities, in turn OH does, and this as\nwell appears to be the reason for the difference in their geometric properties: the properties of\nOS are close to that of P , and OH is closer to \u03bb.\n1. Definitions and facts. In the present paper we shall deal with objects and morphisms\nof the category Comp, that is, with compact Hausdorff spaces and continuous mappings.\nBy C(X), where X \u2208 Comp, we denote the Banach space of all continuous real-valued\nfunctions on X with the sup-norm k\u03c6k = sup{|\u03c6(x)| | x \u2208 X}. By cX , where c \u2208 R, we denote\nthe constant function: cX (x) = c for all x \u2208 X.\nLet X \u2282 Y . We say that a space X is a retract of Y if there exists a map r : Y \u2192 X such\nthat r|X = idX . The space X is an absolute retract (shortly X \u2208 AR), if for any embedding\n2\n\n\fi : X \u0592\u2192 Y the subspace i(X) is a retract of Y .\nRecall that a \u03c4 - system, where \u03c4 is any cardinal number, is a continuous inverse system\nconsisting of compacta of weight \u2264 \u03c4 and epimorphisms over a \u03c4 -complete indexing set. As\nusual, \u03c9 stands for the countable cardinal number. A compactum X is called openly generated,\nif it can be represented as the limit of some \u03c9-system with open bonding mappings [1].\nThe mapping f : X \u2192 Y is called soft if for any space Z and its closed subset A, any\nfunctions \u03c8 : A \u2192 X, \u03a8 : Z \u2192 Y with \u03a8|A = f \u25e6 \u03c8 there is a mapping G : Z \u2192 X such that\nG|A = \u03c8 and \u03a8 = f \u25e6 G [1].\nWe say that a commutative diagram\nX\n\np\n\n/\n\nY\n\nq\n\nf\n\n\u000f\n\nZ\n\ng\n\n\u000f\n/\n\nT\n\nis soft, if its characteristic map \u03c7 : X \u2192 Y \u00d7T Z = {(y, z) \u2208 Y \u00d7 Z |f (y) = g(z)} defined by\n\u03c7(x) = (p(x), q(x)) is soft.\nA triple (F, \u03b7, \u03bc), where F is an endofunctor in category Comp, \u03b7 : IdComp \u2192 F and\n\u03bc : F 2 \u2192 F are natural transformations, is called monad (in sense of Eilenberg and Moore), if\n1) \u03bcX \u25e6 \u03b7F (X) = \u03bcX \u25e6 F (\u03b7X) = idF (X) ; 2) \u03bcX \u25e6 \u03bcF (X) = \u03bcX \u25e6 F (\u03bcX) [13].\nSuppose that F = (F, \u03b7, \u03bc) is a monad. A pair (X, \u03be), where \u03be : F (X) \u2192 X, is called an\nF-algebra, if \u03be \u25e6 \u03b7X = idX and \u03be \u25e6 \u03bcX = \u03be \u25e6 F (\u03be).\nLet \u03bd : C(X) \u2192 R be a functional. We say that \u03bd is: 1) normed, if \u03bd(1X ) = 1; 2) weakly\nadditive, if for any \u03c6 \u2208 C(X) and c \u2208 R we have \u03bd(\u03c6 + cX ) = \u03bd(\u03c6) + c; 3) order-preserving,\nwhenever for any \u03c6, \u03c8 \u2208 C(X) such that \u03c6(x) \u2264 \u03c8(x) for all x \u2208 X (i.e. \u03c6 \u2264 \u03c8) the inequality\n\u03bd(\u03c6) \u2264 \u03bd(\u03c8) holds; 4) positively homogeneous, if for any \u03c6 \u2208 C(X) and any real t \u2265 0 we have\n\u03bd(t\u03c6) = t\u03bd(\u03c6); 5) semiadditive, if \u03bd(\u03c6 + \u03c8) \u2264 \u03bd(\u03c6) + \u03bd(\u03c8).\nQ\nNow for any space X denote V (X) = \u03c6\u2208C(X) [min \u03c6, max \u03c6]. For any mapping f : X \u2192 Y\nlet V (f ) be a mapping such that V (f )(\u03bd)(\u03c6) = \u03bd(\u03c6 \u25e6 f ) for any \u03bd \u2208 V (X), \u03c6 \u2208 C(Y ). Defined\nin that way, V forms a covariant functor in the category Comp.\nFor any space X by O(X) denote the set of functionals satisfying 1)\u20133) (order-preserving\nfunctionals), by OH(X) the set of all functionals on C(X) which satisfy properties 1)\u20134) (positively homogenous functionals), and by OS(X) we denote the set of functionals on C(X) which\nsatisfy properties 1)\u20135) (semiadditive functionals). Also recall that P (X) stands for the set of\nall functionals on C(X) which are normed (k\u03bck = 1), positive (\u03bc(\u03c6) \u2265 0 for all \u03c6 \u2265 0) and\nlinear. Let F stand for one of O, OH, OS, P . The space F (X) is considered as the subspace\n3\n\n\fof V (X). For any function f : X \u2192 Y , the map F (f ) : F (X) \u2192 F (Y ) is the restriction of\nV (f ) on the corresponding space F (X). Then F forms a covariant functor in Comp, which is\na subfunctor of V .\nIt was shown in [5] and [6] that the functor OS is normal, and OH is weakly normal, both\nOH(X) and OS(X) being convex compacta for any space X.\nEach of the abovementioned functors generates a monad. If F is one of V, O, OH, OS, P ,\nthe identity and multiplication maps are defined as follows. The natural transformation \u03b7 :\nIdComp \u2192 F is given by \u03b7X(x)(\u03c6) = \u03c6(x) for any x \u2208 X and \u03c6 \u2208 C(X), and the natural\ntransformation \u03bc : F 2 \u2192 F given by \u03bcX(\u03bd)(\u03c6) = \u03bd(\u03c0\u03c6 ), where \u03c0\u03c6 : F (X) \u2192 R, \u03c0\u03c6 (\u03bb) =\n\u03bb(\u03c6). Later by \u03bcF X we shall denote the multiplication map for the corresponding functor F .\nAccording to the characterization given in [15], by L-monad we mean any submonad of V.\nHence, OH and OS, being submonads of V are both L-monads.\nWe say that an L-monad F = (F, \u03b7, \u03bc) weakly preserves preimages ([3]) if for any mapping\nf : X \u2192 Y and any closed subset A \u2282 Y we have \u03bd(\u03c6) \u2208 [min \u03c6(f \u22121 (A)), max \u03c6(f \u22121(A))] for\nall \u03bd \u2208 (F f )\u22121(F (A)) and all \u03c6 \u2208 C(X).\nLet us recall the notion of convexities introduced in [3]. Let (F, \u03b7, \u03bc) be a monad, and (X, \u03be)\nbe an F-algebra. Let A be a closed subset of X. By fA denote the quotient map fA : X \u2192 X/A,\na = fA (A). We say that CF (A) = \u03be((F fA\u22121(\u03b7(X/A)(a))) is the F-convex hull of A. Also put\nCF (\u00d8) = \u00d8. The set A is called F-convex if A = CF (A). Define CF (X, \u03be) = {A \u2282 X | A is closed\nand A = CF (A)}. The family CF (X, \u03be) forms a convexity on X. Also, any F-algebras morphism\npreserves convexities defined above [3]. Later we'll restrict ourselves with the binary monads.\nA monad F is binary if CF (X, \u03be) is binary, i.e. the intersection of each linked subsystem of\nCF (X, \u03be) is not empty (we call a family of subsets of a space linked if the intersection of the\nfinite number of any of its elements is not empty).\nTheorem A.([3, Theorem 3.3]) Let F be a binary L-monad which weakly preserves preimages, and let X be such that F X is an openly generated (connected) compactum. Then each\nmap f : F X \u2192 Y with F-convex fibers is 0-soft (soft) provided f is open.\nBy exp X, for any compact X, we denote the space of all nonempty closed subsets of X\nequipped with the Vietoris topology (see, e.g., [10]).\nIn what follows we shall need the characterization of OS(X), given in [5]. In particular, the\nfollowing facts take place:\n\u2022 For any A \u2208 exp P (X) the functional \u03bdA given by \u03bdA (\u03c6) = sup{\u03bc(\u03c6)|\u03bc \u2208 A}, where\n4\n\n\f\u03c6 \u2208 C(X), exists and belongs to OS(X). Also \u03bdA = \u03bdconv(A) for any A \u2208 exp P (X)\n(Proposition 3.2);\n\u2022 Any \u03bd \u2208 OS(X) coincides with a functional of the form \u03bdA , where A = {\u03bc \u2208 P (X)|\u03bc(\u03c6) \u2264\n\u03bd(\u03c6) \u2200\u03c6 \u2208 C(X)} is a convex compactum in P (X), in addition, for each \u03c6 \u2208 C(X) there\nis \u03bc \u2208 A such that \u03bc(\u03c6) = \u03bd(\u03c6) (Theorem 3.3);\n\u2022 The correspondence between functionals from OS(X) and closed convex subsets of P (X)\nis one-to-one (Theorem 3.4);\n\u2022 For any f : X \u2192 Y and \u03bdA \u2208 OS(X) we have OS(f )(\u03bdA ) = \u03bdP (f )(A) .\n\n2. When OS(X) and OH(X) are absolute retracts?\nFor any subset A \u2282 OH(X), we see that sup A, inf A also belong to OH(X). Thus, OH(X)\nQ\nis a compact sublattice of \u03c6\u2208CX [min \u03c6, max \u03c6].\nThe following statement can be obtained by applying the same arguments as in [4, Theorem\n1].\nProposition 1. For any surjective function f : X \u2192 Y the mapping OH(f ) is open if and\nonly if f is open.\nFrom the remarks on OS made in the first section one can see that OS is in fact isomorphic\nto the composition of the functors cc and P . Some properties of the functor cc were studied\nin [8]. For any convex compact X, ccX is defined to be the set of all nonempty closed convex\nsubsets of X, ccX is considered as the subspace of exp X. For any affine mapping f : X \u2192 Y\nfunction cc(f ) is given by cc(f )(A) = f (A) where A \u2208 ccX. From [8, Proposition 3.1] and\nopenness of the functor of probability measures follows\nProposition 2. The functor OS is open, i.e. for any open mapping f : X \u2192 Y the map\nOS(f ) is open.\nIt was shown in [3] that the monad O generated by the functor of weakly additive functionals\nweakly preserves preimages (Theorem 4.2). Since OH and OS are submonads of O, they weakly\npreserve preimages as well.\n\n5\n\n\fRecall that the notation L stands for the superextension monad generated by the superextension functor \u03bb (see [10] for details). For any compact X, the space \u03bbX has a functional\nQ\nrepresentation which can be defined by the embedding iX : \u03bbX \u2192 \u03c6\u2208CX [min \u03c6, max \u03c6] such\nthat iX(A)(\u03c6) = sup{inf \u03c6(A)|A \u2208 A}, where A is from \u03bbX and \u03c6 \u2208 C(X). It is easy to see\nthat the image iX(\u03bbX) lies in OH(X). Actually, the natural transformation i = {iX} is a\nmonad morphism which embeds the superextension monad in OH. Therefore, by [3, Theorem\n3.2], OH is binary.\nNow take any openly generated compactum X. Whereas the functor OH is open and the\nspace OH(X) is convex, OH(X) is an openly generated continuum. From Theorem A we see\nthat whenever F is a binary L-monad that weakly preserves preimages, then F (X) \u2208 AR for\nsome compact X provided F (X) is an openly generated connected compactum. Applying this\nfact in our case we see that OH(X) \u2208 AR.\nConversely, if we suppose that OH(X) \u2208 AR for some compact X, then an argumentation\nsimilar to that of [4, Theorem 2] provides that X is an openly generated compactum.\nWe therefore obtain the following fact:\nTheorem 1. OH(X) is an absolute retract if and only if X is an openly generated compactum.\nSo what we get is that OH(X) can be an AR even when the weight of X exceeds \u03c91 .\nThe same could be said on some other functors which generate L-monads and contain L as\nsubmonad, for instance G, O, \u03bb by itself. The functor OS seems to be closer to P . It does not\ngive an AR in weights higher than \u03c91 :\nProposition 3. OS(X) is an absolute retract if and only if X is openly generated with\nw(X)\u2264 \u03c91 .\nProof. Follows from the results of [8], namely [8, Theorem 4.1] combined with results of [7]\nproviding that a statement analogous to that of the proposition holds for the functors cc and\nP.\nCorollary 1. There is no monad embedding i : L \u0592\u2192 OS.\nIndeed, assuming the contrary, we would obtain that OS is binary. Therefore, according to\n\n6\n\n\f[3, Theorem 3.3], the space OS(D \u03c92 ), for example, must be an absolute retract, a contradiction.\n3. The softness of multiplication maps for OH and OS.\nTheorem 2. If the multiplication map \u03bcOS X for OS is soft then X is metrizable.\nProof. Suppose that X is not metrizable and \u03bcOS X is soft. Use [9, Theorem 3] to obtain\nthat X is openly generated.\nRepresent X as the limit of an \u03c9-system S = {X\u03b1 , p\u03b2\u03b1 , A} with open bonding maps. Whereas\n\u03bcX is soft, we can assume that all limit diagrams\nOS 2 (p\u03b1 )\n\nOS 2 (X)\n\n/ OS ( X\n\n\u03bcX\n\n\u03b1)\n\n\u03bcX\u03b1\n\n\u000f\n\nOS(X)\n\nOS(p\u03b1 )\n\n/\n\n\u000f\n\nOS(X\u03b1 )\n\nare soft [9, Theorem 2], hence open.\nNow our aim is to obtain \u03b10 \u2208 A and an accumulation point x \u2208 X\u03b10 such that p\u22121\n\u03b10 (x)\ncontains more than one point. The weight of X is uncountable, so its character is uncountable\ntoo, since w(X) = \u03c7(X) for any openly generated compactum [4]. Choose x0 \u2208 X with\n\u03c7(x0 , X) > \u03c9 and some \u03b1 \u2208 A, put x\u03b1 = p\u03b1 (x0 ). Then p\u22121\n\u03b1 (x\u03b1 ) contains more than one\npoint, otherwise x0 would have the countable character. If x\u03b1 is not isolated, Then x\u03b1 is the\nrequired point. Suppose that x\u03b1 is isolated. Consider x1 \u2208 p\u22121\n\u03b1 (x\u03b1 ) distinct from x0 . We can\nchoose \u03b11 > \u03b1 with p\u03b11 (x1 ) 6= p\u03b11 (x0 ). Again p\u22121\n\u03b11 (x0 ) is not a singleton, and if p\u03b11 (x0 ) is\nan accumulation point, we are done. Assume the opposite. Take any x2 \u2208 p\u22121\n\u03b11 (p\u03b11 (x0 )) with\nx2 6= x0 and \u03b12 > \u03b11 such that p\u03b12 (x2 ) 6= p\u03b12 (x0 ) and continue the process as described above.\nIf on any step i the point p\u03b1i (x0 ) is not an accumulation point, we obtain the sequence {xi }i\u2208N\nof points in X and the up-directed chain of elements {\u03b1i }i\u2208N of A which has the least upper\n\u03b1\n\nbound \u03b10 \u2208 A. Then the space X\u03b10 is the limit of the inverse system {X\u03b1i , p\u03b1ji , i \u2264 j} and\nlimi\u2192\u221e p\u03b10 (xi ) = p\u03b10 (x0 ). Indeed, the family {(p\u03b1\u03b10i )\u22121 (p\u03b1i (x0 ))} forms a base of neighborhoods\nat p\u03b1 (x0 ), and for any such (p\u03b1\u03b10i )\u22121 (p\u03b1i (x0 )) we see that p\u03b10 (xj ) is contained in it for all j \u2265 i.\nTherefore, \u03b10 \u2208 A and x = p\u03b10 (x0 ) chosen above are as required.\nAccording to our assumption, the diagram\n\n7\n\n\fOS 2 (p\u03b10 )\n\nOS 2 (X)\n\n/\n\nOS (X\u03b10 )\n\u03bcOS X\u03b10\n\n\u03bcOS X\n\n\u000f\n\nOS(X)\n\nOS(p\u03b10 )\n\n/\n\n\u000f\n\nOS(X\u03b10 )\n\nis open.\nConsider the accumulation point x \u2208 X\u03b10 chosen above and distinct y1 , y2 \u2208 p\u22121\n\u03b10 (x). Let\n{xi }\u0131\u2208I be the net converging to x. Choose yi \u2208 p\u22121\n\u03b10 (xi ) for every i \u2208 I the way that {yi }i\u2208I\nwould converge to x1 .\nDenote \u03bd = (\u03b4y1 + \u03b4y2 )/2 and V = \u2206\u03b4x . Then the net (\u03bdi , Vi )= ((\u03b4yi + \u03b4y2 )/2, \u2206(\u03b4x +\u03b4xi )/2 ) converges to (\u03bd, V). To obtain a contradiction with openness of \u03c7, and therefore softness of \u03bcOS X,\nshow that the inverse of the characteristic map of the considered diagram is not continuous.\nIndeed, let us consider \u03c7\u22121 (((\u03b4yi + \u03b4y2 )/2, \u2206(\u03b4x +\u03b4xi )/2 ) = (OS 2 (p\u03b10 ))\u22121 (Vi ) \u2229 (\u03bcOS X)\u22121 (\u03bdi ). Suppose that \u0398 \u2208 (OS 2 (p\u03b10 ))\u22121 (Vi ). Then supp \u0398 is in OS((p\u03b10 )\u22121 (x)\u222a(p\u03b10 )\u22121 (xi )). Now take any\n\u0398 = \u0398A \u2208 (\u03bcOS X)\u22121 (\u03bdi ) (recall that any functional \u03b7 \u2208 OS(Y ) is of the form \u03b7 = \u03b7B , where\nB \u2208 ccP (Y )). We want to show that supp \u0398A is in OS({yi , y2 }). Indeed, assuming the contrary,\nwe obtain that there is a measure M \u2208 A that is not supported on OS({yi, y2 }), therefore there\nexists \u03b8 \u2208\n/ OS({yi , y2}) from the support of M. So we can choose a function \u03c6 \u2208 C(X) which is\nzero at {y2 , yi }, \u03b8(\u03c6) > 0 and 0X \u2264 \u03c6. Since \u03c0\u03c6 is continuous, there exists a closed neighborhood\nV of \u03b8 on which \u03c0\u03c6 is strictly greater than zero. Also, supp M \u2229 V 6= \u00d8, so M(V ) > 0. This\nimplies M(\u03c0\u03c6 ) > 0, and hence \u03bcOS X(\u0398A )(\u03c6) = \u0398A (\u03c0\u03c6 ) = sup{M(\u03c0\u03c6 ) | M \u2208 A} > 0, whereas\n\u03bdi (\u03c6) = 0 which gives us \u03bcOS X(\u0398A ) 6= \u03bdi . That's why any \u0398 \u2208 (OS 2(p\u03b10 ))\u22121 (Vi )\u2229(\u03bcOS X)\u22121 (\u03bdi )\nmust be supported on OS({yi, y2 }). The only such functional \u0398 which also satisfies the condition \u03c7(\u0398) = ((\u03b4yi + \u03b4y2 )/2, \u2206(\u03b4x +\u03b4xi )/2 ) is the measure \u2206(\u03b4yi +\u03b4y2 /2 . Therefore, there is some\nneighborhood V1 of the functional (\u2206\u03b4y1 + \u2206\u03b4y2 )/2 \u2208 \u03c7\u22121 (\u03bd, V) that contains no elements of the\nform \u2206(\u03b4yi +\u03b4y2 )/2 starting from some i0 \u2208 I, hence \u03c7\u22121 is not continuous, and the diagram is\nnot open, a contradiction with the initial assumption. Theorem is proved.\nThe following are the results for OH which show that it behaves the same way as the monad\nO.\n\nTheorem 3. \u03bcOH X is open for any compactum X.\nProof of Theorem 3 is the same as that for O [3].\nTheorem 4. \u03bcOH X is soft if and only if X is an openly generated compactum.\n8\n\n\fProof. Necessity. Let X = lim S, where S = {X\u03b1 , p\u03b1 , A} is an \u03c9-system consisting of\nmetrizable compacta and epimorphisms. The mapping \u03bcOH X is soft, hence we can assume\nthat all the limit diagrams of the form\nOH 2 (p\u03b1 )\n\nOH 2 (X)\n\nOH (X\u03b1 )\n\n/\n\n\u03bcOH X\u03b1\n\n\u03bcOH X\n\n\u000f\n\nOH(X)\n\nOH(p\u03b1 )\n\n/\n\n\u000f\n\nOH(X\u03b1)\n\nare open. Assume that X is not openly generated, so that there exists \u03b1 \u2208 A such that p\u03b1 is not\nopen. Then by Proposition 2 the mapping OH(p\u03b1) is not open. Therefore, there is a functional\n\u03bd \u2208 OH(X\u03b1) and a net {\u03bdi }i\u2208I converging to \u03bd such that the net OH(p\u03b1 )\u22121 (\u03bdi ) converges to\nsome A 6= OH(p\u03b1)\u22121 (\u03bd). We have that A \u2282 OH(p\u03b1)\u22121 (\u03bd). Choose two comparable elements\n\u03b81 \u2208 A and \u03b82 \u2208 OH(p\u03b1)\u22121 (\u03bd)\\A. Let, for example, \u03b81 \u2264 \u03b82 . Let {\u03b8i } be a net converging to \u03b82\nsuch that \u03b8i \u2208 OH(p\u03b1 )\u22121 (\u03bdi ) for all i \u2208 I. We see that the net {(\u03b8i , \u03b7OH(X\u03b1)(\u03bdi ))} converges to\n(\u03b82 , \u03b7OH(X\u03b1)(\u03bd)). Now let V \u2208 OH 2(X) be a functional such that V(\u03a6) = max{\u03a6(\u03b81 ), \u03a6(\u03b82 )}.\nThen \u03c7(V) = (\u03b82 , \u03b7OH(X\u03b1)(\u03bd)), where \u03c7 is the characteristic map of the diagram. Choose\n\u03a6 \u2208 C(OH(X)) with \u03a6(\u03b82 ) = 1 and \u03a6(\u03b8) = 0 for any \u03b8 \u2208 A. Then we may take that\n\u03a6(\u03b8) \u2264 f rm[o]\u2212\u2212/2 for any OH(p\u03b1)\u22121 (\u03bdi ), hence, using [4, Lemma 2], we get that \u0398(\u03a6) \u2264 1/2\nfor all \u0398 \u2208 (OH 2 (p\u03b1 ))\u22121 (\u03b7OH(X\u03b1)(\u03bdi )). Thus we obtained an open neighborhood of V of the\nform V = {\u0398 \u2208 OH 2(X) |\u0398(\u03a6) > 1/2} with V \u2229 \u03c7\u22121 (\u03b8i , \u03b7OH(X\u03b1)(\u03bdi )) = \u00d8, a contradiction\nwhich shows that X must be openly generated.\nSufficiency. The monad OH is a binary monad which weakly preserves preimages. Since\n\u03bcOH X : OH 2 (X) \u2192 OH(X) is an open OH-algebras morphism and OH 2(X) is openly generated (by Theorem 3), the softness of \u03bcOH X follows from Theorem A. The statement is proved.\n\nReferences\n[1] Shchepin E V Functors and uncountable powers of compacta. Uspekhi Mat. Nauk 36 1981, 3\u201362\n(in Russian).\n[2] V.V.Fedorchuk, V.V.Filippov.
