The analysis rests on the scale invariance of the Navier-Stokes equation for high Reynolds number, and on the\nassumptions that the singularities due to the invariance distribute themselves\nmultifractally in physical space. The multifractal analysis belongs to the line\nof study based on a kind of ensemble theoretical approaches that, starting\nfrom K41 [15], continues with the log-normal model [16,17,18], the \u03b2-model\n[19], the p-model [20,21], the 3D binomial Cantor set model [22] and so on.\nEmail address: arimitsu@cm.ph.tsukuba.ac.jp (Toshihico Arimitsu).\n\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier Science\n\n27 October 2018\n\n\fAfter a rather preliminary investigation of the p-model [1], we developed further to derive the analytical expression for the scaling exponents of velocity\nstructure function [2,3,4,5], and to determine the probability density function\n(PDF) of velocity fluctuations [5,6,7,8], of velocity derivative [9] and of fluid\nparticle accelerations [10] by a self-consistent statistical mechanical approach.\nIt has been shown [5] that the multifractal analysis derives the log-normal\nmodel [16,17,18] when one starts with the Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy.\nIn this paper, we derive the formula for the PDF of the accelerations of a fluid\nparticle in fully developed turbulence by means of the multifractal analysis,\nand will analyze two experiments. One is the PDF of accelerations at R\u03bb =\n690 of the Taylor microscale Reynolds number obtained in the Lagrangian\nmeasurement of particle accelerations that was realized by Bodenschatz et\nal. [23,24,25] by raising dramatically the spatial and temporal measurement\nresolutions with the help of the silicon strip detectors. The other is the PDF\nof accelerations at R\u03bb = 380 [26] that was extracted by Gotoh from the DNS\nof the size 10243 [27] which may be the largest mesh size available at present.\nFor high Reynolds number Re \u226b 1, or for the situation where effects of the\nkinematic viscosity \u03bd can be neglected compared with those of the turbulent\nviscosity, the Navier-Stokes equation,\n~ u = \u2212\u2207\n~ (p/\u03c1) + \u03bd\u22072~u,\n\u2202~u/\u2202t + (~u * \u2207)~\n\n(1)\n\nof an incompressible fluid is invariant under the scale transformation [28,29,21]\n~r \u2192 \u03bb~r,\n\n~u \u2192 \u03bb\u03b1/3~u,\n\nt \u2192 \u03bb1\u2212\u03b1/3 t,\n\n(p/\u03c1) \u2192 \u03bb2\u03b1/3 (p/\u03c1)\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the exponent \u03b1 is an arbitrary real quantity. The quantities \u03c1 and p\nrepresent, respectively, mass density and pressure. The acceleration ~a of a fluid\nparticle is given by the substantive time derivative of the velocity:\n~ u.\n~a = \u2202~u/\u2202t + (~u * \u2207)~\n\n(3)\n\nThe Reynolds number Re of the system is given by\nRe = \u03b4uinlin /\u03bd = (lin /\u03b7)4/3\n\n(4)\n\nwith the Kolmogorov scale \u03b7 = (\u03bd 3 /\u01eb)1/4 [15] where \u01eb is the energy input rate\nat the energy-input scale lin. The velocity fluctuation \u03b4uin is defined by putting\nln = lin in \u03b4un = |u(\u2022 + ln ) \u2212 u(\u2022)| where u is a component of velocity field ~u,\nand ln is a distance between two observing points. We are measuring distance\n2\n\n\fby the discrete units\nln = \u03b4n l0\n\n(5)\n\nwith \u03b4n = 2\u2212n (n = 0, 1, 2, * * *) and l0 being some reference length. The nonnegative integer n represents the multifractal depth. However, we will treat it\nas positive real number in the analysis of experiments.\nIt may be worthwhile to note here that, within the energy cascade model, the\ndiameter ln\u0304 of eddies should be defined by\nln\u0304 = \u03b4n\u0304 lin .\n\n(6)\n\nTherefore, if one identifies the distance ln with the diameter ln\u0304 of the n\u0304th\neddies within the energy cascade model, one has the relation\nn\u0304 = n \u2212 log2 (l0 /lin )\n\n(7)\n\nbetween the number n of the multifractal steps and the number n\u0304 of the steps\nwithin the energy cascade. We see that lin = l0\u0304 as it should be.\nIntroducing the pressure (divided by the mass density) difference\n\u03b4pn = |p/\u03c1(\u2022 + ln ) \u2212 p/\u03c1(\u2022)|\n\n(8)\n\nbetween two points separated by the distance ln , the accelerations may be\nestimated by\n|~a| = n\u2192\u221e\nlim an\n\n(9)\n\nwhere we introduced the acceleration\nan = \u03b4pn /ln\n\n(10)\n\nbelonging to the multifractal depth n. The acceleration becomes singular for\n\u03b1 < 1.5, i.e.,\nlim an = lim \u03b4pn /ln \u223c lim ln(2\u03b1/3)\u22121 \u2192 \u221e\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nln \u21920\n\nln \u21920\n\n(11)\n\nwhich can be seen with the relation\n\u03b4pn /\u03b4p0 = (ln /l0 )2\u03b1/3 .\n\n(12)\n3\n\n\fThe values of exponent \u03b1 specify the degree of singularity.\n\n2\n\nMultifractal spectrum\n\nThe multifractal analysis rests on the multifractal distribution of \u03b1. The probability P (n) (\u03b1)d\u03b1 to find, at a point in physical space, a singularity labeled by\nan exponent in the range \u03b1 \u223c \u03b1 + d\u03b1 is given by [2,3,4,5]\nP (n) (\u03b1) = Z\u03b1(n)\n\n\u22121\n\nh\n\n1 \u2212 (\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b10 )2 /(\u2206\u03b1)2\n\nin/(1\u2212q)\n\n(13)\n\nwith an appropriate partition function Z\u03b1(n) and\n(\u2206\u03b1)2 = 2X/[(1 \u2212 q) ln 2].\n\n(14)\n\nThe range of \u03b1 is \u03b1min \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 \u03b1max with\n\u03b1min = \u03b10 \u2212 \u2206\u03b1,\n\n\u03b1max = \u03b10 + \u2206\u03b1.\n\n(15)\n\nIt may be worthwhile to put here its brief derivation in order to make the\npaper self-contained. The distribution function (13) is derived by taking an\nextremum of the generalized entropy, the R\u00e9nyi entropy [13]\nSqR [P (1) (\u03b1)] = (1 \u2212 q)\u22121 ln\n\nZ\n\nd\u03b1P (1) (\u03b1)q\n\n(16)\n\nor the Tsallis entropy [11,12,14]\nSqT [P (1) (\u03b1)]\n\n= (1 \u2212 q)\n\n\u22121\n\n\u0012Z\n\nd\u03b1 P\n\n(1)\n\nq\n\n\u0013\n\n(\u03b1) \u2212 1 ,\n\n(17)\n\nunder the two constraints, i.e., the normalization of distribution function:\nZ\n\nd\u03b1P (1) (\u03b1) = const.,\n\n(18)\n\nand the q-variance being kept constant as a known quantity:\n\u03c3q2\n\n=\n\n\u0012Z\n\nd\u03b1P\n\n(1)\n\nq\n\n(\u03b1) (\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b10 )\n\n2\n\n\u0013.Z\n\n4\n\nd\u03b1P (1) (\u03b1)q .\n\n(19)\n\n\fHere, we assume that the distribution function at the nth multifractal depth\nhas the structure\nP (n) (\u03b1) \u221d [P (1) (\u03b1)]n .\n\n(20)\n\nThis is consistent with the relation [21,5]\nP (n) (\u03b1) \u221d \u03b4n1\u2212f (\u03b1)\n\n(21)\n\nthat is a manifestation of scale invariance and reveals how densely each singularity, labeled by \u03b1, fills physical space. In the present model, the multifractal\nspectrum f (\u03b1) is given by [2,3,4,5]\nf (\u03b1) = 1 + (1 \u2212 q)\u22121 log2 [1 \u2212 (\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b10 )2 /(\u2206\u03b1)2 ].\n\n(22)\n\nIn spite of the different characteristics of these entropies, i.e., extensive and\nnon-extensive, the distribution functions giving their extremum have the common structure (13). 1\nThe dependence of the parameters \u03b10 , X and q on the intermittency exponent \u03bc is determined, self-consistently, with the help of the three independent\nequations, i.e., the energy conservation:\nh\u01ebn i = \u01eb,\n\n(23)\n\nthe definition of the intermittency exponent \u03bc:\nh\u01eb2n i = \u01eb2 \u03b4n\u2212\u03bc ,\n\n(24)\n\nand the scaling relation 2 :\n1/(1 \u2212 q) = 1/\u03b1\u2212 \u2212 1/\u03b1+\n\n(25)\n\nwith \u03b1\u00b1 satisfying f (\u03b1\u00b1 ) = 0. The average h* * *i is taken with P (n) (\u03b1).

The intermittency exponent \u03bc is determined by analyzing the measured scaling exponent \u03b6m of the\nvelocity structure function with the formula (36) as mentioned before.\nAs for the determination of the value n, the flatness of the PDF of fluid particle\naccelerations can be a good candidate [25]. Actually, the present multifractal\nanalysis provides us with the analytical formula for the flatness of the PDF in\nthe form\n(n)\n\n(n)\n\n2\u03b3\u0303 + (1 \u2212 2\u03b3\u03030 ) a8 \u03b4n\u03b68\nFa(n) \u2261 hha4n ii/hha2n ii2 = hh\u03c9n4 ii = h 4\ni2\n(n)\n(n)\n2\u03b3\u03032 + (1 \u2212 2\u03b3\u03030 ) a4 \u03b4n\u03b64\na8\n\u03b4 \u03b68 \u22122\u03b64 .\n\u2248\n(n)\n2 n\n(1 \u2212 2\u03b3\u03030 ) a4\n\n(50)\n(51)\n\nWith this formula, the experimental value of the flatness Fa(n) gives the value\nof the multifractal step n. In deriving the approximate formula (51), we used\nthe fact that the first terms both in the denominator and numerator of the last\nformula in (50) are two or three orders in magnitude smaller than the second\nterms.

Therefore, at this stage, we can determine almost\nthe final shape and the magnitude of the tail part given by (40). It means\nthat the shape of the center part, which is controlled by q \u2032 , rarely affect the\ntail part, and that the contribution of the center part to the normalization of\nPDF is almost independent of q \u2032 . The n-dependence of the flatness is given\nin Fig. 1 both for the cases corresponding to the experiments conducted by\nBodenschatz et al. with the approximate formula\nFa(n) = \u22126.872 + 5.216n \u2212 9.969 \u00d7 10\u22121 n2\n+1.075 \u00d7 10\u22121n3 \u2212 5.296 \u00d7 10\u22123 n4 + 1.241 \u00d7 10\u22124n5 ,\n\n(52)\n\nand to the DNS performed by Gotoh et al. with\nFa(n) = \u22127.592 + 5.831n \u2212 1.114n2\n+1.203 \u00d7 10\u22121n3 \u2212 5.925 \u00d7 10\u22123 n4 + 1.389 \u00d7 10\u22124n5 .\n\n(53)\n\nThe slight difference between the two formulae comes from the difference of\nthe values q \u2032 (see Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 below).\nWithin the present stage of the multifractal analysis, the value q \u2032 is determined\nby adjusting the center part with the experimental data. However, since the\ncenter part of the PDF takes care only smaller accelerations compared with\nits deviation, we can expect that the dynamical analysis such as done by\nBeck [32,33] may be effective.

[25] in Fig. 2 on (a) log and (b) linear\nscale. We determined the value n = 17.1 for this experiment by substituting\ninto its definition (5), i.e., n = log2 (l0 /ln ), the reported value of the integral\nlength scale 0.071 m for l0 , and of the spatial measurement resolution 0.5 \u03bcm\nfor ln [23,24]. The intermittency exponent \u03bc = 0.240 is extracted by the\nmethod of least squares with respect to the logarithm of PDFs as the best fit\nof our theoretical formulae with n = 17.1 to the observed values of the PDF\n[23,24,25]. We discarded those points whose PDF values are less than \u223c 10\u22127\nsince they scatter largely on log scale. Substituting the extracted value of \u03bc\ninto the self-consistent equations, we have the values of parameters: q = 0.391,\n\u03b10 = 1.138 and X = 0.285. With these values, other quantities are determined,\ne.g., \u2206\u03b1 = 1.161, \u03b1+ \u2212 \u03b10 = \u03b10 \u2212 \u03b1\u2212 = 0.6815, \u03b1\u2020 = 1.005, \u03c9n\u2020 = 0.605 and\n\u03c9nmax = 2040.

PDF of accelerations plotted on (a) log and (b) linear scale. Comparison\nbetween the PDF of fluid particle accelerations measured in the DNS by Gotoh\net al. at R\u03bb = 380 and the present theoretical PDF \u039b\u0302(n) (\u03c9n ). Closed circles are\nthe DNS data points both on the left and right hand sides of the PDF. Solid lines\nrepresent the curves given by the present theory (40) and (43) with \u03bc = 0.240\n(q = 0.391), n = 17.5 and q \u2032 = 1.70.\n\nflatness of the PDF of accelerations has the value Fa(n) = 56.9 which is within\nthe reported value of the flatness 55 \u00b1 4 [25]. This results tells us that the\nformula (50) of the flatness can be used to derive the value of \u03bc, accurately,\nwhen one knows the value of n, and vice versa (see Fig. 1 and also Fig. 4\nbelow).\nAnalysis of the PDF of accelerations extracted out from the DNS data obtained by Gotoh et al. [27] at R\u03bb = 380 is shown in Fig. 3 on (a) log and\n(b) linear scale. The value \u03bc = 0.240 for this DNS has been determined by\nthe analysis of the experimental scaling exponent \u03b6m of longitudinal velocity\nstructure function with our theoretical formula (36) [8,9]. Substituting this\nvalue of \u03bc into the self-consistent equations, we have the values of parameters:\nq = 0.391, \u03b10 = 1.138, X = 0.285, \u2206\u03b1 = 1.161 and \u03b1+ \u2212\u03b10 = \u03b10 \u2212\u03b1\u2212 = 0.6815\nwhich are the same as those derived in the analysis of the experiment by Bodenschatz, since both systems have a common value \u03bc = 0.240 for the intermittency exponent. The value n = 17.5 is extracted by the method of least\nsquares with respect to the logarithm of PDFs as the best fit of our theoretical formulae with the derived parameters given above to the observed data\nof the PDF [27]. Note that \u03b1\u2020 = 1.005, \u03c9n\u2020 = 0.622 and \u03c9nmax = 2534. The\nbest fit at the center part is given with q \u2032 = 1.7. The flatness of the PDF\nis Fa(n) = 70.0. The characteristic distance r = ln for n = 17.5 reduces to\nr/\u03b7 = 7.91 with \u03b7 \u2248 0.258 \u00d7 10\u22122 [27], which is about three times longer\nthan the length \u2206r/\u03b7 = 2\u03c0/(1024\u03b7) = 2.38 of the mesh of Gotoh's DNS. In\nexperimental PDF for larger accelerations [25].\n\n12\n\n\fderiving the characteristic distance, we used the second formula in 5\nn = \u22121.050 log2 (r/\u03b7) + 16.74 (lc \u2264 r)\nn = \u22122.540 log2 (r/\u03b7) + 25.08 (r < lc ).\n\n(54)\n(55)\n\nHere, lc /\u03b7 = 48.26 is the crossover length of two scaling regions, and is close\nto the Taylor microscale \u03bb/\u03b7 = 38.33. With the help of the formula (7), we\nhave n\u0304 = 11.8.\nIn Fig. 4, we put the lines representing the integrand \u03c9n4 \u039b\u0302(n) (\u03c9n ) of the flatness\nFa(n) and the corresponding experimental data (a) by Bodenschatz et al. [25],\nand (b) by Gotoh et al. [27]. The agreements are remarkable.\n\n6\n\nComment on the energy-input scale\n\nThere is no room to incorporate, automatically, into the present multifractal\nanalysis the energy input scale lin and the \"system size\" l0 . The former is necessary to determine the number of steps n\u0304 in the energy cascade model. Once\nlin is determined by investigating the structure of experimental apparatuses,\nthe relation between n\u0304 and the multifractal step n is given by (7). Since main\npart of the multifractal analysis rests on the scale invariance, the size of the\nsystem under consideration is assumed to be infinite, and therefore, the value\nof the reference length l0 introduced in (5) is determined only through the\nanalysis of experimental data.\nActually, for example, the empirical equation [6]\nn = \u22121.019 log2 r/\u03b7 + 0.901 log2 Re\n5\n\n(56)\n\nThe empirical formulae (54) and (55) were extracted through the multifractal\nanalysis for the PDFs of velocity fluctuations measured at two points separated by\nr [8]. The corresponding numbers n and n\u0304 are given by (r/\u03b7, n, n\u0304) = (2.38, 21.5,\n14.5), (4.76, 20.0, 13.0), (9.52, 16.8, 9.81), (19.0, 14.0, 7.01), (38.1, 11.8, 4.81), (76.2,\n10.1, 3.11), (152, 9.30, 2.31), (305, 8.10, 1.11), (609, 7.00, 0.01), (1220, 6.00, -0.99). It\nseems that there are two scaling regions constituting the inertial range. The formula\n(55) indicates that in the lower scaling region (r < lc ) eddies break up, effectively,\ninto 1.33 pieces in contrast to the upper scaling region (lc \u2264 r) where eddies break\nup into two pieces as seen in (54) [8]. The existence of the two scaling regions can\nbe an artifact of DNS due to a shortage of calculation time, since energy cascading\nprocess is not so effective for eddies whose sizes are smaller than lc or the Taylor\nmicroscale. Note that Gotoh et al. claimed that the inertial range is restricted only\nto the region around n\u0304 = 3.11, 2.31 and 1.11 [27].\n\n13\n\n\f\u03bc\n\n\u03bc =0.260,\n\n=16.2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n10\n\n<\n\n<\n\n( n)\n\n(b)\n\n\u03a0 (\u03be n ) \u03a0\n\n(a)\n\n\u03c9 n4 \u039b( n ) (\u03c9 n )\n\n\u03c9 n4 \u039b( n ) (\u03c9 n )\n\n\u03a0 (\u03be n ) \u03a0\n\n10\n\n=0.260,\n\n=0.260,\n\n=16.2\n\n=16.2\n\n<\n\n<\n\n\u20132\n\n10\n\nn\n\n\u03be\n\n\u20131\n\n10\n\n\u20134\n\n10\n0\n\n10\n\n\u03c9\n\n1\n\n\u20131\n\n10\n\n10\n\nn\n\n0\n\n10\n\n\u03c9\n\n1\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\nn\n\nFig. 4.

(open squares for the data on the left hand side, and open\ncircles on the right hand side), and (b) DNS quantity by Gotoh et al. (closed circles\nboth for the data on the left and right hand) in loglog scale. The parameters in the\ntheoretical PDFs for (a) and (b) are the same as those given in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3,\nrespectively.\n\nextracted from the experimental PDFs for velocity fluctuations 6 by Lewis\nand Swinney [34] gives l0 \u2248 877 cm. In their analysis, the Reynolds number\nRe = 540 000 is estimated with lin = 2\u03c0 \u00d7 19.00 cm \u2248 119.32 cm and the Kolmogorov scale \u03b7 \u2248 0.006 cm. Therefore, the reference length is large compared\nwith the energy-input scale.\nFor Gotoh's DNS, the empirical equation (54), extracted by the analysis of\nPDFs of velocity fluctuations, gives l0 /\u03b7 \u2248 63 000 which is larger than the\nenergy-input scale lin/\u03b7 = \u03c0/(k\u03b7) \u2248 497 with the wavenumber k = 61/2 of\nforcing where we took 209 grid point spacings for the measure of the energyinput scale [35]. We see again that the reference length is longer than the\nenergy-input scale. The Reynolds number of the DNS is now estimated by\n(4) as Re = 3 937. A unified study of Gotoh's DNS [27] by means of the\nmultifractal analysis with the Tsallis-type PDF for the center part will be given\nelsewhere, in which it is shown that the PDFs for the velocity fluctuations, for\n6\n\nThe velocity fluctuations are measured at two separated points whose distance is\nr. The corresponding numbers n and n\u0304 are given by [10] (r/\u03b7, n, n\u0304) = (11.6, 14,\n10.7), (23.1, 13, 9.7), (46.2, 11, 8.7), (92.5, 10, 7.7), (208, 9.0, 6.6), (399, 8.0, 5.6),\n(830, 7.5, 4.6), (1440, 7.0, 3.8). The relation (56) is extracted with these values [6].\n\n14\n\n\fthe velocity derivatives and for the fluid particle accelerations in addition to\nthe scale exponents of velocity structure function provide us with consistent\nresults.\nIn the analysis of Bodenschatz's experiment, the identification of l0 with the\nintegral length scale 7.1 cm gives us reasonable value of n = 17.1 in the\nsense that with this value the formula (50) of the flatness provides us with\n\u03bc = 0.240 for the intermittency exponent. This value turns out to be the same\nas the one observed by Gotoh et al. in their DNS. Since Bodenschatz assigned\nRe = 31 400 with the formula (4), \u03b7 = 30.3 \u03bcm gives lin = 0.071 m, as it\nshould be. Therefore, in this case, we see that the energy-input scale is equal\nto the integral length scale, i.e., lin = l0 , and that n\u0304 = n = 17.1.\n\n7\n\nDiscussions\n\nA comparison of the PDFs of accelerations are put in Fig. 5 on (a) log and (b)\nlinear scale. The thin and the thick lines are those theoretical PDFs in Fig. 2\nand in Fig. 3, respectively. The analysis of the data by Bodenschatz for the\naccelerations in terms of the log-normal model was performed just the same\nway as the multifractal analysis to get \u03bc = 0.260 and n = 15.5. The resulting\nPDF is given by dashed line which deviates slightly upward for larger values\nof \u03c9n compared with the thin line. This deviation can be understood from\nthe scaling exponents \u03b6m of the velocity structure function within the lognormal model. It becomes negative for larger values of m. The dotted line is\nthe empirical PDF given by Bodenschatz et al. [25] which deviate downward\nfor larger values of \u03c9n . The dotted-dashed line is the PDF given by Beck [36]\nfor the studies both of the PDFs by Bodenschatz et al. and of Gotoh et al..\nThe lines other than the present theoretical PDFs in Fig. 5 give rather poor\nexplanations at the center part. 7\nFrom the above analyses of two experiments, we reveal that there are two\nmechanisms contributing to the PDF of the accelerations, i.e., one is for the\ntail part, and the other for the center part. The structure of the PDF \u039b\u0302(n) (\u03c9n )\nfor the tail part, \u03c9n\u2020 \u2264 |\u03c9n |, is given by (40) that represents the intermittent large deviations which is a manifestation of the multifractal distribution\nof singularities in physical space due to the scale invariance of the NavierStokes equation for large Reynolds number. The experiment conducted by\nBodenschatz et al. [23,24] visualized the singularities in physical space by\ntracing the \"fluid particle\" in turbulence. The specific form (40) comes from\nthe distribution function for the singularity exponent \u03b1 that is represented\n7\n\nBeck introduced a somewhat artificial cutoff in his formula in order to fix its\ndefect at the center part of the PDF [37].\n\n15\n\n\f\u03bc=0.260,\n\n(n )\n\n\u03a0 (\u03be n )\n\n10\n\n0\n\n<\n\n\u03be\n(b)\n\n\u03bc\n\n(n)\n\nn\n\n(\u03c9 n )\n\n1\n\n=16.2\n\n\u039b\n\n\u039b\n\n(n)\n\nn\n\n(\u03c9 n )\n\n(a)\n\n\u03bc\n\n<\n\n<\n\n10\n\n\u20135\n\nn\n\n\u03be\n\n0.5\n\n10\n\n=0.260,\n\n=16.2\n\n\u201310\n\nstretche exp. fit (old)\n\n0\n\n100\n\n\u03c9 n\u03be\n\n0\n0\n\n200\nn\n\n1\n\nn\n\n\u03c9 n\u03be\n\n2\n\nFig. 5. Comparison of PDFs of accelerations on (a) log and (b) linear scale. The\nthin and thick lines are, respectively, the present theoretical PDFs in Fig. 2 and\nFig. 3. The dashed line represents the PDF within the log-normal model, and the\ndotted line does the empirical PDF given by Bodenschatz et al.. The dotted-dashed\nline is the PDF given by Beck [36].\n\nby the Tsallis-type distribution function (13) with the parameter q which is\ndetermined by the observed value of the intermittency exponent. The flatness of the PDF mainly provides us with the information of this tail part.\nThe structure of the PDF for the center part, |\u03c9n | \u2264 \u03c9n\u2020 , is given by (43)\nthat represents small deviations violating the scale invariance due to thermal\nfluctuations and/or observation error. The PDF for this part is assumed to\nbe given by the Tsallis-type distribution function for acceleration itself with\nthe parameter q \u2032 . In this paper, the value of q \u2032 are determined with the help\nof the experimentally observed PDF at the center part, giving q \u2032 = 1.45 and\nq \u2032 = 1.7 which is close to 1.5 proposed by Beck [32,33]. The value of q \u2032 should\nbe determined by investigating the dynamics of thermal fluctuations and/or\nobservation error on the multifractal support, which may have non-additive\ncharacter. This is one of the attractive future problems. Note that we already\nsaw a dependence of ln(1/(q \u2032 \u2212 1)) on ln(r/\u03b7) through the study of the PDFs\nof velocity fluctuations, a detailed of which will be reported elsewhere. The\ntail part and the center part are separated at \u03c9n\u2020 \u2248 0.6. This gives \u03b1\u2020 \u2248 1\nthat satisfies the condition \u03b1 < 1.5 in which the singularity appears in fluid\nparticle accelerations.\nWe saw that the PDFs derived within the multifractal analysis seem to be\nsensitive to the characteristic lengths such as the distance of two measuring\npoints, the space resolution in measurement and the mesh size of DNS. We\nalso knew that the multifractal distribution of singularities in physical space,\non which the present analysis rests, is robust enough to allow us to apply the\nmultifractal analysis to the ranges outside of the inertial range. How to put the\ninformation of energy-input scale into the multifractal analysis is one of the\n16\n\n\fimportant future problems [38]. It may be resolved when one succeeds to reveal\nthe dynamical foundation underlying the basis of the multifractal analysis,\nstarting an investigation by the stochastic Navier-Stokes equation with the\nenergy input term. If one could put the stochastic Navier-Stokes equation\nunder the influence of white Gaussian noise, describing thermal fluctuation\nrelated to kinematic viscosity, into a linealized stochastic equation with a\nrenormalized turbulent viscosity [39], the relevant stochastic process should be\nthe one related to the PDF of accelerations derived in this paper, which may be\nnamed R\u00e9nyi or Tsallis process. The success of the multifractal analysis in the\nstudies of experimental PDFs may indicate that the multifractal distribution\nof singularities in physical space are robust against the addition of the energyinput term.\nThe application of the present multifractal analysis to the micrometeorological\nstudy of atmospheric turbulence is one of the attractive future problems. The\ntail part is specified by the intermittency exponent, and the center part may\ngive us the information, for example, about the thermodynamical structure\nof the canopy in Amazon forest [40]. The application to the vortex tangle\n[41] in the superfluids 4 He and 3 He is another examples of the exciting future\nproblems. In low temperature, the tail part of PDF comes from the singularity\nin the superfluid component within the two fluid model, and is determined by\nthe intermittency exponent. Whereas, the value of q \u2032 for the center part of\nPDF may be determined by the dynamical structure of quantized vortices.\nThe multifractal analysis may also open new aspect for the systems with large\ndeviation found in a large variety of areas (see, for example, the web site in\n[12]), and its applications to these areas will be reported elsewhere.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thank Prof. R.H.
