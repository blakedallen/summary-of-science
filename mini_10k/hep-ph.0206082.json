It is\ncurrently thought that this dark matter is made of relique\nself-gravitating gases which are labeled as \"cold\"(CDM)\nor \"hot\" (HDM), depending on the relativistic or nonrelativistic nature of the particles energetic spectrum at\ntheir decoupling from the cosmic mixture [1], [2], [3].\nHDM scenarios are not favoured, as they seem to be incompatible with current theories of structure formation\n[2], [3], [4]. CDM, usualy examined within a newtonian\nframework, can be considered as non-interactive (collisionless particles) or self-interactive [5]. N-body numerical simmulations are often used for modeling CDM gases\n[6], [7], [8], [9]. However, in recent numerical simulations\n(see [7], [8], [9]) non-interactive CDM models present the\nfollowing discrepancies with observations at the galactic\nscale [10], [11]: (a) the \"substructure problem\" related\nto excess clustering on sub-galactic scales, (b) the \"cusp\nproblem\" characterized by a monotonic increase of den-\n\n\u2217 Contribution to Proceeedings of the IV Taller de la Divisi\u00f3n\nde Gravitaci\u00f3n y F\u0131\u0301sica Matem\u00e1tica de la Sociedad Mexicana de\nF\u0131\u0301sica (DGyFM-SMF).

In order to deal with these problems, the possibility of self-interactive dark matter has\nbeen considered, so that nonzero pressure or thermal effects can emerge, thus leading to self-interactive models of CDM (i.e. SCDM) [12], [13], [14], [15], [16] and\n\"warm\" dark matter (WDM) models [17]-[22] that challenges the duality CDM vs. HDM. Other proposed dark\nmatter sources consist replacing the gas of particles approach by scalar fields [23], [24] and even more \"exotic\"\nsources[25].\nWhether based on SCDM or WDM, current theories\nof structure formation point towards dark matter characterized by particles having a mass of the order of at\nleast keV's (see [12]-[22]), thus suggesting that massive\nbut light particles, such as electron neutrinos and axions\n(see Table 1), should be eliminated as primary dark matter candidates (though there is no reason to assume that\nthese particles would be absent in galactic halos). Of all\npossible weakly interactive massive particles (WIMPS),\ncomplying with the required mass value of relique gases,\nonly the massive Neutrinos (the muon or tau neutrinos),\nhave been detected, whereas other WIMPS (neutralino,\ngravitino, photino, sterile neutrino, axino, etc.) are speculative. See [26], [27] [28] and Table 1 for a list of candidate particles and appropriate references.\nIn this paper we develop an alternative description\nof galactic DM. Since the dark matter halo constitutes\nabout 90 % of the galactic mass, we consider the galactic garvitational field as a spacetime whose sole, selfgravitating, source is this halo, described as a perfect\nfluid. Assuming this galactic spacetime to be static and\n\n\f2\nsphericaly symmetric, the barionic dark matter can be\nthough of as test particles following stable and circular\ngeodesics of this spacetime curvature. Since the tangential velocity, v, along these geodesics can be calculated\nfor such a spacetime, we can express the field equations\nin terms of of v. However, the velocity profile v = v(r)\nhas been observed for a wide range of galaxies, leading\nto \"Universal Rotatition Curves\" (URC's) that provide\nan empiric fit to these rotation velocities[31]. Therefore,\nby inserting the empiric formula for the URC derived\nby Persic and Salucci [30] into the field equations (given\nin terms of v(r)), we obtain a constraint on one of the\nmetric coefficients. Once this constraint is solved, we\ncan obtain the state variables characterizing the galactic\ndark fluid associated with this URC. We solve this constraint assuming that the velocities are non-relativistic,\nthus expanding around v0 /c \u226a 1, where v0 is the terminal velocity associated with the flattening of the URC.\nII.\n\nIII.\n\nTHERMODYNAMICS\n\nIf we assume that the self gravitating ideal \"dark\" gas\nexists in physical conditions far from those in which the\nquantum properties of the gas particles are relevant, we\nwould be demanding that these particles comply with\nMaxwell-Boltzmann (MB) statistics. Following [34], the\ncondition that justifies an MB distribution is given by\nn ~3\n\u226a1,\n(m kB T )3/2\n\n(6)\n\nFIELD EQUATIONS\n\nConsidering the line element of a static spherically\nsymmetric space time\nd r2\n1 \u2212 2 M (r)/r\n\u0001\nd\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8 d\u03c62 ,\n\nds2 = \u2212A2 (r) c2 dt2 +\n+r2\n\nV2\nr A\u2032\n2\n\u2261\nv\n(r)\n=\n.\nc2\nA\n\n\u03c1 = mc2 n +\n\n(2)\n\nBecomes a dynamical variable replacing A(r).

Equation (14) shows how\n\"flattened\" rotation curves, as obtained from the empiric\nform (12), lead to M \u221d r3 for r \u2248 0 and M \u221d r for large\nr.

It is still\ninteresting to find out that the isothermal sphere can be\nobtained from General Relativity in the limit v0 /c \u226a 1\nby demanding that rotation curves have a form like (12).\nThe total mass of the galactic halo, usualy given as M\nevaluated at the radius r = r200 (the radius at which \u03c1 is\n200 times the mean cosmic density). Assuming this density to be \u2248 10\u221229 gm/cm3 together with typical values\nv0 = 200km/sec and a = 1 yields r200 \u2248 150 kpc. Evaluating M at this values yields about 1017 M\u2299 , while M\nevaluated at a typical \"optical radius\" r = 15 kpc leads\nto about 1012 M\u2299 , an order of magnitude larger than the\ngalactic mass due to visible matter.\nV.\n\n2(3a2 + x2 ) 2\nv\n(a2 + x2 )2 0\n#\n\n18x4 + 55a2 x2 + 13a4 4\nv0 + O(v06 ) ,\n2(a2 + x2 )3\n\n(19)\n\nwhile n in (10) follows by substituting (14) into (17),\nusing T from (13) and then expanding around v0 .

For\ndark matter dominated galaxies (spiral and low surface\nbrightness (LSB)) [30] these parameters have a small\nvariation range: ropt \u2248 15 kpc, 0.6 \u2264 a \u2264 2.3 and\n125 km/sec \u2264 v0 \u2264 300 km/sec, the constraint (23) does\nprovide a tight estimate of the minimal value for the mass\nof the particles under the assumption that these particles\nform a self gravitating ideal dark gas complying with MB\nstatistics. As shown in Figure 2, this minimal value lies\nbetween 30 and 60 eV , thus implying that appropriate\nparticle candidates must have a much larger mass than\nthis figure [29]. This minimal bound excludes, for instance, light mass thermal particles such as the electron\nneutrino (m\u03bde < 2.2 eV). The axion is also very light\n(mA \u2248 10\u22125 eV ) but it is not a thermal relique and\nso we cannot study it under the present framework. The\ncurrently accepted estimations of cosmological bounds on\nthe sum of masses for the three active neutrino species is\nabout 24 eV , a value that would apparently rule out all\nneutrino flavours. However, recent estimations of these\ncosmological bounds have raised this sum to about 1 keV\n[42], hence more massive neutrinos could also be accomodated as dark matter particle candidates. Estimates of\nmasses of various particle candidates are displayed in Table 1.\n\nFIG. 3: Relation between particle mass and central temperature. This graph displays the relation between log 10 (Tc ) (in\nK) and log10 (m) (in keV's) that follows from equation (24)\nfor a terminal velocity v0 = 200 km/sec. Almost identical\nplots are obtained for other velocities in the observed range\n125 km/sec \u2264 v0 \u2264 250 km/sec. The circle and box symbols respectively denote the proton and electron mass yielding central\ntemperatures of the order Tc \u2248 106 , 103 K. The central temperature for light particles in the range 0.5 keV \u2264 m \u2264 100 keV\nis less than 300 K (rectangle in the left), while for massive\nsypersymmetric particles in the range 1 GeV \u2264 m \u2264 100 GeV,\nwe have Tc as large as 109 K (rectangle on the right). However, such high temperatures cannot rule out these weakly interactive particles as components of the dark matter MB gas.\n\nSince T \u2248 Tc , the consistency condition (21) provides\nthe following constraint on the temperature and particles\nmass of the dark gas\nm\n3 kB\neV\n=\n\u2248 0.4 \u00d7 103\n,\n2\nTc\nv0\nK\n\n(24)\n\nwhere we have taken v0 = 300 km/sec. Considering in\n(24) the minimal mass range that follows from (23), we\nwould obtain gas temperatures consistent with the assumed typical temperatures of relic gases: Tc \u2248 2 to 4 K.\nHowever, since we have no way of infering a value for the\ntemperature of the ideal dark gas, we have no clear cut\ncriterion for the estimate of a maximal bound for this\nmass. If we assume that the ideal dark gas is made of\nelectrons or barions, so that m = mp or m = me , then\ncondition (23) for applicability of the MB distribution is\ncertainly satisfied and (24) implies a temperature of the\norder of Tc \u2248 103 K for electrons and Tc \u2248 106 K for\nbarions. Obviuosly, barions or electrons at such a high\ntemperatures would radiate and certainly not remain unobservably \"dark\". However, as long as the interaction\n\n\f6\ntype of particles accounting for a galactic halo, would\nhave to be modeled, either as a relativistic MB gas (very\nlight particles can be relativistic even at low temperatures) and/or in terms of a distribution that takes into\naccount Fermi-Dirac or Bose-Einstein statistics. These\nstudies will be undertaken in future papers [29].\n\nis weak and the particles are not charged, we cannot rule\nout any other particle candidate only on the basis of the\ngas temperature, even if this temperature is very high\n(see Figure 3) as in the case of massive supersymmetric\nparticles. As shown in Table 1, a wide range of weakly\ninteractive particles can be considered as possible main\ncomponents of a MB dark gas, including popular supersymmetric particles (the neutralino), as well as hypothetical light particles predicted by current literature based\non WDM models of structure formation [2], [3]. The main\nnovelty of the present paper is the fact that it is based on\na general relativistic hydrodynamics, as opposed to numerical simulations [7]-[9], newtonian or Kinetic Theory\nperturbative approaches (see [12]-[22]).\nFinaly, the fact that we have obtained a minimal mass\non the range 30 \u2212 60 eV , that seems to discriminate\nagainst very light thermal particles like the electron neutrino, coincides with the fact that these HDM particle\ncandidates tend to be ruled out because of their inability to produce sufficient matter clustering [2], [3], [29].\nIn spite of these arguments, a self gravitating gas of this\n\nWe thank Professor Rabindra N.
