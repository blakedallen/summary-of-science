Introduction\nIn this paper we study the low energy dynamics of supersymmetric QCD (SQCD) in\nthe presence of certain F-term deformations. The starting point of our analysis is an N = 1\nsupersymmetric gauge theory with gauge group SU (Nc ) and Nf > Nc flavors of chiral\ne i (\u03b1 = 1, * * * , Nc ;\nsuperfields in the fundamental representation of the gauge group, Q\u03b1 , Q\ni\n\n\u03b1\n\ni = 1, * * * , Nf ). This theory has a global symmetry\n\nSU (Nf ) \u00d7 SU (Nf ) \u00d7 U (1)B \u00d7 U (1)R\n\n(1.1)\n\nand a non-trivial moduli space of vacua, which has been extensively studied and is rather\nwell understood; see e.g. [1-6] for reviews.\nA natural question is what happens when we deform the theory by adding a general\nsuperpotential that preserves a particular subgroup of the global symmetry (1.1), such as\nthe non-chiral subgroup SU (Nf )diag \u00d7U (1)B . A class of superpotentials with this property\nis\n\nn0\nX\n1\nWel =\nmn TrM n\nn!\nn=1\n\n(1.2)\n\nwhere the meson field\ne i Qj\nMji = Q\n\n(1.3)\n\nis an Nf \u00d7 Nf matrix (the color indices are summed over in (1.3)). Terms with n > 1\n\nin (1.2) are non-renormalizable, which is reflected in the fact that the couplings mn have\n\ndimension [mn ] = 3 \u2212 2n at the free fixed point. One can think of the superpotential (1.2)\n\nas providing an effective description below a certain energy scale.\ne It has been known for a\nIn the case mn = m1 \u03b4n,1 (1.2) is a mass term for Q, Q.\n\nlong time that the resulting theory has Nc supersymmetric vacua, in accordance with the\nWitten index. More recently, it was found [7] that for Nc < Nf < 23 Nc and small m1 there\n\nare metastable non-supersymmetric ground states as well. Such states might be useful for\ndescribing supersymmetry breaking in nature.\nThe purpose of this paper is to study more general superpotentials of the form (1.2).\nWe will mainly discuss the case where only the two lowest terms in (1.2) are non-zero, i.e.\n1\nWel = m1 TrM + m2 TrM 2\n2\n1\n\n(1.4)\n\n\fbut will also comment on higher order superpotentials. We will see that such superpotentials lead generically to a rich landscape of supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric\nvacua, and explore some of their properties. Related works include [8-18].\nLike in [7], we will find it useful to utilize the Seiberg dual description of SQCD, in\nwhich the gauge group is SU (Nf \u2212 Nc ), and the meson (1.3) becomes a gauge singlet\nfield. We will analyze the dynamics in both the electric and the magnetic descriptions and\n\ncompare them.\nThe deformed SQCD with superpotential (1.4) has a simple embedding in string theory, along the lines of [19-30]. In a companion paper [31] we describe the relevant string\nconstruction, and in particular its connection to the gauge theory results of this paper.\nWe find that the brane description provides a complementary picture to the gauge theory\none.\nThe plan of the paper is as follows. In section 2 we construct the supersymmetric\nground states of the theory (1.4), and verify that the electric and magnetic descriptions\ngive rise to the same vacuum structure once all the relevant quantum effects have been\nincluded. In section 3 we describe metastable states in this theory. In section 4 we discuss\nour results and comment on generalizations.\n\n2. Vacuum structure of deformed SQCD\n2.1. A first look at the vacuum structure\nThe N = 1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with gauge group SU (Nc ) discussed in\nthe previous section, which we will refer to as the electric theory, is equivalent in the infrared\n[32] to another gauge theory, which we will refer to as the magnetic theory. The latter has\ngauge group SU (Nf \u2212 Nc ) and the following set of chiral superfields: Nf fundamentals of\n\nthe gauge group, q i , q\u0303i , i = 1, * * * , Nf , and a gauge singlet Mji which, as suggested by the\n\nnotation, is identified with the gauge invariant meson field (1.3) in the electric theory.\nThe magnetic quarks q, q\u0303 and meson M are coupled via the superpotential\nWmag =\n\n1\nq\u0303i Mji q j .\n\u039b\n\n(2.1)\n\nThe scale \u039b is related to the dynamically generated scales of the electric and magnetic\ntheories, \u039be , \u039bm , by the scale matching relation [1]\n3Nc \u2212Nf\n\n\u039be\n\n3(Nf \u2212Nc )\u2212Nf\n\n\u039bm\n\n2\n\n= (\u2212)Nf \u2212Nc \u039bNf .\n\n(2.2)\n\n\fWe are interested in adding to the electric Lagrangian the superpotential\nWel =\n\n\u03b1\ne 2 \u2212 mTr(QQ)\ne = \u03b1 TrM 2 \u2212 mTrM\nTr(QQ)\n2\n2\n\n(2.3)\n\nwhich has the form (1.4), with m1 = \u2212m and m2 = \u03b1. In the magnetic description this\n\ncorresponds to deforming (2.1) to\nWmag =\n\n1\n\u03b1\nq\u0303i Mji q j + TrM 2 \u2212 mTrM .\n\u039b\n2\n\n(2.4)\n\nSince the superpotential (2.4) is quadratic in M , we can integrate this field out. The\nresulting superpotential for the magnetic quarks is given by:\nWmag\n\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\n1\n2\n=\u2212\nTr(q\u0303q) \u2212 mTr(q\u0303q) .\n\u03b1\u039b 2\u039b\n\n(2.5)\n\nComparing to (2.3) we see that the magnetic superpotential has the same qualitative form\nas the electric one.\nConversely, one can write the electric superpotential (2.3) in a way similar to the\nmagnetic one by integrating in a gauge singlet field N :\n1 ei j\n\u03b1e\nWel = \u2212 Q\nNi Qj \u2212\nTrN 2 + me TrN .\n\u039b\n2\n\n(2.6)\n\nRequiring that integrating out N leads back to (2.3) gives\n\u03b1=\n\n1\n,\n\u03b1e \u039b2\n\nm=\n\nme\n.\n\u03b1e \u039b\n\n(2.7)\n\nComparing (2.6) to (2.4) we see that the two superpotentials have very similar forms. Note\nalso that we chose the normalization of the field N (which transforms as a singlet under\nthe electric gauge group) such that it is identified in the infrared with the magnetic quark\nbilinear N = q\u0303q. This is the dual version of the relation between the singlet meson M in\nthe magnetic theory and the bilinear in electric quarks, (1.3).\nAlthough the two forms of the magnetic superpotential, (2.4) and (2.5), describe the\nsame long distance physics, there is a physical difference between them, which becomes\nimportant for small \u03b1. In this limit, the mass of M in (2.4) is small, and at energies above\nthat mass this field should be included in the dynamics. The description (2.5) does not\ncontain this field; it coincides with (2.4) only at energies well below the mass of M . Similar\ncomments apply to the electric superpotentials (2.3), (2.6) in the limit \u03b1e \u2192 0.\n3\n\n\fTo recapitulate, we see that the analysis of the vacuum structure in the electric and\nmagnetic descriptions is essentially identical, up to the replacement Nc \u2194 Nf \u2212Nc , \u03b1 \u2194 \u03b1e ,\n\nm \u2194 me , etc. We will verify later that the two descriptions lead to the same vacuum\nstructure, in agreement with Seiberg duality.\n\nAt first sight, it actually seems that the electric and magnetic theories have different\nvacuum structures. Consider, for example, the classical magnetic superpotential (2.4). To\nfind the supersymmetric vacua we need to solve the F-term constraints\nMji q j =0 ,\nq\u0303i Mji =0 ,\n1 j\nq\u0303i q =m\u03b4ij \u2212 \u03b1Mij .\n\u039b\n\n(2.8)\n\nFrom (2.8) we learn that M satisfies the matrix equation\nmM = \u03b1M 2 .\n\n(2.9)\n\nOn solutions of the equations of motion one can choose M to be diagonal. Equation (2.9)\nimplies that its eigenvalues can take only two values, 0 and\nwe can take\nM=\n\n\u0012\n\n0\n0\n\n0\nm\n\u03b1 INf \u2212k\n\nm\n.\n\u03b1\n\nWithout loss of generality\n\n\u0013\n\n(2.10)\n\nwhere k = 0, 1, 2, * * * , Nf and In is the n \u00d7 n identity matrix. Plugging (2.10) into the last\n\nline of (2.8) implies that\n\nq\u0303q =\n\n\u0012\n\nm\u039bIk\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(2.11)\n\nThe rank of the matrix on the left hand side is at most Nf \u2212 Nc . Hence, one must have\nk \u2264 Nf \u2212 Nc .\n\nNote that the vacua (2.10), (2.11) go off to infinity in field space as the deformation\n\nparameter \u03b1 (2.4) goes to zero. In particular, for \u03b1 = 0 supersymmetry is spontaneously\nbroken. This is consistent with the fact that for \u03b1 = 0 the classical superpotential (2.4)\nhas an unbroken U (1)R symmetry, with Rq = Rq\u0303 = 0, RM = 2. For \u03b1 6= 0 this symmetry\n\nis explicitly broken, and one expects [33] that supersymmetric vacua exist.\n\nExpanding around the solution (2.10), (2.11) one finds that the only massless degrees\nof freedom are gauge fields and fermions associated with pure N = 1 SYM corresponding to\nthe unbroken gauge group SU (Nf \u2212 Nc \u2212 k). As mentioned above, quantum mechanically\n\nthis theory has Nf \u2212 Nc \u2212 k vacua with a mass gap (for Nf \u2212 Nc \u2212 k \u2265 2). Thus, the\n4\n\n\fabove analysis implies that the theory with superpotential (2.4) has the following number\nof vacua (up to Nambu-Goldstone bosons associated with broken global symmetries):\nNf \u2212Nc \u22121\n\nNmag = 1 +\n\nX\n\nk=0\n\n1\n(Nf \u2212 Nc \u2212 k) = 1 + (Nf \u2212 Nc )(Nf \u2212 Nc + 1) .\n2\n\n(2.12)\n\nThe 1 in (2.12) corresponds to the case k = Nf \u2212 Nc where the expectation values of\nthe baryon fields b = q Nf \u2212Nc and b\u0303 = q\u0303 Nf \u2212Nc are non-zero, which we will refer to as the\nbaryonic branch.\nAs mentioned above, the analog of the magnetic superpotential (2.4) in the electric\ntheory is (2.6). This superpotential clearly leads to the same vacuum structure as (2.12)\nwith the replacement Nf \u2212 Nc \u2192 Nc ,\nNel = 1 +\n\nNX\nc \u22121\nk=0\n\n1\n(Nc \u2212 k) = 1 + Nc (Nc + 1) .\n2\n\n(2.13)\n\nThus, the electric and magnetic answers are in general different, whereas Seiberg duality\nimplies that they must agree. The resolution has to do with quantum corrections to the\nsuperpotentials of the electric and magnetic theories. We next turn to a discussion of these\ncorrections, first in the special case Nf = Nc + 1, and then in general. We will see that\nafter including quantum effects the number of supersymmetric vacua is given by\nNvac = max(Nel , Nmag )\n\n(2.14)\n\nin both the electric and the magnetic theories.\n2.2. Quantum corrections for Nf = Nc + 1\nThis case is particularly simple, since the magnetic gauge group is empty. At the same\ntime, according to (2.14) the number of vacua is in this case supposed to be given by the\nelectric result (2.13), which is larger than the magnetic one (2.12). The magnetic quarks\nq i are proportional to the electric baryons B i , and it is convenient to use the latter as the\nfundamental degrees of freedom. The magnetic superpotential (2.4) is known to receive\nan important correction proportional to detM , and takes the form [34]\nWmag =\n\n1\n2Nf \u22123\n\n\u039be\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011 \u03b1\ni j\ne\nBi Mj B \u2212 detM + TrM 2 \u2212 mTrM .\n2\n5\n\n(2.15)\n\n\fThe new term in the superpotential leads to a correction to the F-term condition on the\nthird line of (2.8), which now becomes\n\u0011\n\u0010\n2Nf \u22123\nj\nj\nj\n\u22121 j\ne\nBi B \u2212 (detM )(M )i + \u039be\n\u03b1Mi \u2212 m\u03b4i = 0 .\n\n(2.16)\n\nTo analyze the solutions of these equations we need to distinguish between the cases where\nthe meson matrix M is regular and singular. Consider first the case where it is regular,\nwhich we will refer to as the mesonic branch. Then, the first two lines of (2.8) (with\nq i \u221d B i ) imply that\n\nej = 0\nBi = B\n\nwhile (2.16) takes the form\n2Nf \u22123\n\n\u039be\n\n(2.17)\n\n\u0001\n\u03b1M 2 \u2212 mM = (detM )INf .\n\n(2.18)\n\nAs before, on solutions of the equations of motion we can diagonalize M . Since the left\nhand side of (2.18) is proportional to the identity matrix, the Nf eigenvalues of M must\ntake at most two distinct values, which we will denote by x and y, and are related as\nfollows:\nx+y =\n\nm\n.\n\u03b1\n\nThe vacua split into classes labeled by an integer 0 \u2264 k \u2264\n\n(2.19)\nNf\n2\n\n, with k of the eigenvalues\n\nof M equal to y, and Nf \u2212 k equal to x. The upper bound on k takes into account the\n\nfreedom of exchanging x and y.\n\nFor k = 0, M is proportional to the identity matrix, M = xINf . Plugging this form\ninto (2.18) we find\n2Nf \u22123\n\n\u039be\n\n(\u03b1x \u2212 m) = xNf \u22121 .\n\n(2.20)\n\nThere are Nf \u2212 1 = Nc solutions for x, and thus Nc vacua with this form of M . For generic\n\n\u03b1, and in particular when \u03b1 is sufficiently small, the Nc solutions of (2.20) are all distinct\n\nand non-vanishing, as expected.\nFor k 6= 0 the two distinct eigenvalues of M satisfy\n2Nf \u22123\n\n\u039be\n\n2Nf \u22123\n\n\u039be\n\n(\u03b1x \u2212 m) =xNf \u2212k\u22121 y k ,\n(\u03b1y \u2212 m) =xNf \u2212k y k\u22121 .\n\n(2.21)\n\nUsing (2.19) we can rewrite both lines of (2.21) as\n2Nf \u22123\n\n\u2212\u03b1\u039be\n\n= xNf \u2212k\u22121 y k\u22121 .\n6\n\n(2.22)\n\n\fSince y is linearly related to x, (2.22) is a polynomial equation for x of order Nf \u2212 2. It\n\nhas Nf \u2212 2 = Nc \u2212 1 distinct solutions with x, y 6= 0 (again, for generic \u03b1). Thus, for odd\nNf the number of supersymmetric vacua of the magnetic theory is given by:\n1\n1\nNc + (Nf \u2212 1)(Nc \u2212 1) = Nc (Nc + 1) .\n(2.23)\n2\n2\nFor even Nf we have to analyze separately the case k = Nf /2 for which the degeneracies\n\nof the two eigenvalues x and y are equal. In this case, due to the symmetry of interchange\nof x and y we actually have only 12 (Nf \u2212 2) = 12 (Nc \u2212 1) distinct solutions of (2.22). The\n\ntotal number of vacua is in this case\n1\n1\n1\nNc + (Nf \u2212 2)(Nc \u2212 1) + (Nf \u2212 2) = Nc (Nc + 1) .\n(2.24)\n2\n2\n2\nWe see that for both even and odd Nf , the total number of vacua in the magnetic description (2.4) agrees with (2.14), except for the contribution of the baryonic branch to which\nwe turn next.\nSo far we assumed that the meson matrix M is non-degenerate. The analysis needs\nto be modified when some of its eigenvalues vanish. It turns out that the only non-trivial\ncase is the one in which exactly one eigenvalue of M vanishes. Thus, we take\nM = diag(M1 , M2 , * * * , MNf )\n\n(2.25)\n\nand consider the limit M1 \u2192 0 with the rest of the Mj remaining finite. The first two lines\ne are B 1 , B\ne1 . Eq. (2.16) leads to:\nof (2.8) imply that the only non-zero components of B, B\nm\nMj = , j = 2, * * * , Nf ,\n\u03b1\n(2.26)\n\u0010 m \u0011Nf \u22121\n2N \u22123\ne1 =\nB1B\n+ m\u039be f\n.\n\u03b1\nIncluding this extra vacuum, which corresponds to the baryonic branch in the classical\nanalysis, brings the total number of vacua into agreement with (2.14).\nIf k > 1 eigenvalues of M go to zero, (2.16) has no solutions. Indeed, in that case the\ne lie in the degenerate,\nfirst two lines of (2.8) imply that the non-zero components of B, B\nk dimensional, subspace. In that subspace, (2.16) implies that\nej \u221d \u03b4 i ,\nBiB\nj\n\n(2.27)\n\nwhich is impossible to satisfy since the left hand side has rank 1 while the right hand side\nhas rank k > 1.\nTo summarize, for Nf = Nc + 1 we conclude that the number of vacua of the magnetic\ntheory is given by (2.14). The term that goes like detM in the magnetic superpotential\n(2.15) is crucial for the analysis. The analog of this term for generic Nf > Nc + 1 comes\nfrom quantum effects in the magnetic theory. We next turn to a discussion of these effects.\n7\n\n\f2.3. Quantum corrections for Nf > Nc + 1\nWe would like to extend the analysis of the previous subsection to general Nf . Consider a vacuum in which the expectation value of the meson field M has r vanishing\neigenvalues and Nf \u2212 r non-vanishing ones. As mentioned in subsection 2.1, the F-term\nconstraint on the third line of (2.8) implies that r \u2264 Nf \u2212 Nc . Therefore, at least Nc\neigenvalues of M must be non-zero. In particular, we can bring it to the form\n\u0012\n\u0013\nc 0\nM\nM=\n0 M0\n\n(2.28)\n\nc is an (Nf \u2212 Nc + 1) \u00d7\nwhere M0 is a non-degenerate (Nc \u2212 1) \u00d7 (Nc \u2212 1) matrix, and M\n\n(Nf \u2212 Nc + 1) one, which may or may not be degenerate (but whose rank is at least one).\n\nSince M0 is non-degenerate, the flavors of quarks q, q\u0303 that couple to it via (2.1) are\n\nmassive and can be integrated out at low energies. This leads to an SU (Nf \u2212 Nc ) gauge\n\ntheory with Nf \u2212 Nc + 1 flavors q a , q\u0303\u00e3 (a, \u00e3 = 1, * * * , Nf \u2212 Nc + 1), whose scale is given by\n2(Nf \u2212Nc )\u22121\n\n\u039bL\n\n=\n\ndetM0 3(Nf \u2212Nc )\u2212Nf\n\u039bm\n.\n\u039bNc \u22121\n\n(2.29)\n\nThis theory is of the sort discussed in the previous subsection.

The new element is the dependence on M0 which needs\nto be taken into account.\nAs before, the F-term equations of motion of N , b, b\u0303 have two kinds of solutions: one\nin which N is non-degenerate, and another in which it has exactly one vanishing eigenvalue.\nConsider first the mesonic branch, where N is non-degenerate. In this case it is\nconvenient to go back to (2.31) and integrate out N , b, b\u0303. This amounts to setting b = b\u0303 = 0\nin (2.31) and replacing N by the solution of its equation of motion,\ncN =\nM\n\n\u039bNc\n3(N \u2212N )\u2212Nf\n\u039bm f c\n\ndetN\nIN \u2212N +1 .\ndetM0 f c\n\n(2.34)\n\nSolving for N and substituting in (2.31) (using (2.2)) we get\nWmag = Tr\n\n\u0010\u03b1\n2\n\n2\n\n\u0011\n\nM \u2212 mM \u2212 (Nf \u2212 Nc )\n\n\u0012\n\ndetM\n3Nc \u2212Nf\n\n\u039be\n\n\u0013N\n\n1\nf \u2212Nc\n\n(2.35)\n\nwhere M is the full meson matrix (2.28), which is non-degenerate in this case. Of course,\nthe determinant term in (2.35) is nothing but the well known non-perturbative superpotential [1-6] for the meson field in SQCD. We could have gotten it directly from (2.4) by\nassuming that M is a non-degenerate matrix and integrating out the massive quarks q, q\u0303.\nThe fact that we got it with the correct coefficient is a check on the algebra.\nWe can now generalize the discussion of the previous subsection and look for (nonsingular) solutions of the F-term equations corresponding to the superpotential (2.35):\n\u03b1M 2 \u2212 mM =\n\n\u0012\n\ndetM\n3Nc \u2212Nf\n\n\u039be\n\n\u0013N\n\n1\nf \u2212Nc\n\nINf .\n\n(2.36)\n\nAgain, the matrix M has only two distinct eigenvalues x, y satisfying the relation (2.19),\nand vacua are labeled by an integer k which keeps track of the number of times the\neigenvalue y (say) appears.\nConsiderations similar to those that led to (2.22) give\n3Nc \u2212Nf\n\nxNc \u2212k y k\u2212Nf +Nc = (\u2212\u03b1)Nf \u2212Nc \u039be\n\n.\n\n(2.37)\n\nTogether with (2.19) this gives a polynomial equation for x, whose order depends on Nf , Nc\nand k.\n9\n\n\fConsider first the case Nf \u2264 2Nc . For k \u2264 Nf \u2212 Nc , (2.37) is a polynomial of degree\n\nNc \u2212 k. Thus it has Nc \u2212 k solutions. For Nf \u2212 Nc \u2264 k \u2264\n\nNf\n2\n\nthe degree of the polynomial\n\nand the number of solutions are given by 2Nc \u2212 Nf . Summing over k one finds that the\nnumber of vacua (up to global symmetries) is 12 Nc (Nc + 1), as before (2.23).\n\nFor Nf \u2265 2Nc the picture is slightly different. For 0 \u2264 k \u2264 Nc one finds Nf \u2212 Nc \u2212 k\nNf\n2\n\nsolutions, and for Nc \u2264 k \u2264\n\n, Nf \u2212 2Nc solutions. The total in this case is\n\n1\n2 (Nf\n\nNc )(Nf \u2212 Nc + 1), again in agreement with (2.14).\n\n\u2212\n\nIt is not surprising that for Nf > 2Nc the number of vacua agrees with the magnetic\n\nanswer, while for Nf < 2Nc it does not. The non-perturbative superpotential in (2.35)\nNf\n\ngives a correction to the classical superpotential for M , (2.4), that goes like M Nf \u2212Nc . For\nNf > 2Nc this correction is subleading at large M relative to the leading, M 2 , term, and\none does not expect it to change the number of vacua. On the other hand, for Nf < 2Nc\nit changes the behavior of the potential at infinity, and it is natural that the number of\nvacua changes.\nSo far we assumed that the matrix N (2.30) is regular. As we saw in the previous\nsubsection, the only other case we need to consider is the baryonic branch, in which the\nrank of N is Nf \u2212 Nc (i.e. one of the eigenvalues of N goes to zero). We can choose this\n\neigenvalue to be N11 . The F-term equations of the superpotential (2.31) take in this case\nthe form:\nc11 =\nM\n\nwhere [detN ]11\n\n\u039b\n2(Nf \u2212Nc )\u22121\n\n\u039bL\n\ni m\nh\n;\n[detN ]11 \u2212 b1 b\u03031 =\n\u03b1\n\n(2.38)\ncj =0; N j = m\u039b\u03b4 j , i, j > 1 ;\nM\ni\ni\ni\nm\nM0 = INc \u22121 ,\n\u03b1\nis the determinant of N with the first row and column discarded (i.e. the\n\n(11) minor of the matrix N ).\nThus, the meson matrix M takes the form\n\u0012 (1)\nM\nM=\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n\u0013\n\n(2.39)\n\nwhere M (1) is proportional to the Nc \u00d7 Nc identity matrix,\nM (1) =\n\nm\nIN .\n\u03b1 c\n\n(2.40)\n\nThe (Nf \u2212 Nc + 1) \u00d7 (Nf \u2212 Nc + 1) matrix N has a block proportional to the (Nf \u2212 Nc )\n\ndimensional identity matrix (2.38). Overall, we find that the number of vacua in the\nmagnetic gauge theory with the superpotential (2.4) agrees precisely with (2.14).\n10\n\n\f2.4. Matching the electric and magnetic descriptions\nIn the previous two subsections we performed a detailed analysis of the supersymmetric\nvacua of the magnetic gauge theory (2.4), and in particular reproduced (2.14) in that\ndescription. It is interesting to check this result in the electric description. In fact, this\ndoes not require any additional work. As mentioned above, the description of the electric\ngauge theory via the superpotential (2.6) is identical to the magnetic one (2.4) with the\nsubstitutions\nNc \u2192 Nf \u2212 Nc ,\n\u039bm \u2192 \u039be ,\n\u039b \u2192 \u2212\u039b ,\n\n(2.41)\n\n(m, \u03b1) \u2192 \u2212(me , \u03b1e ) ,\ne ,\n(q, q\u0303) \u2192 (Q, Q)\nM \u2192N .\n\nAs a check, note that the transformation on the first three lines of (2.41) is a symmetry of\nthe scale matching condition (2.2).\nTo see how the vacua we found in the previous subsections arise in the electric description (2.6), consider for example the case Nc < Nf < 2Nc (the regime Nf > 2Nc is\nvery similar). In the magnetic description we found vacua in which the meson matrix M\n(1.3) takes the form (up to global symmetries)\nM = diag(xNf \u2212k , y k )\n\n(2.42)\n\nwith x and y satisfying the relations (2.19), (2.37). The number of solutions as a function\nof k is Nc \u2212 k for 0 \u2264 k \u2264 Nf \u2212 Nc , and 2Nc \u2212 Nf for Nf \u2212 Nc \u2264 k \u2264\n\nNf\n2\n\n.\n\nTo analyze this case in the electric variables we need to use the map (2.41). Due to\n\nthe transformation of the number of colors, the electric theory is actually in the opposite\nec = 2(Nf \u2212 Nc ). According to that\nregime of the analysis of subsection 2.3, Nf > 2N\nanalysis, the electric meson matrix N takes in this case the form\nN \u2212k\n\nN = diag(xe f\n\n, yek )\n\n(2.43)\n\nec = Nf \u2212 Nc there are Nf \u2212 N\nec \u2212 k = Nc \u2212 k solutions, and\nwhere now for 0 \u2264 k \u2264 N\nec \u2264 k \u2264 Nf there are Nf \u2212 2N\nec = 2Nc \u2212 Nf solutions. Comparing to\nfor Nf \u2212 Nc = N\n2\n11\n\n\fthe magnetic analysis, we see that the degeneracies are exactly the same for all k, and we\nshould identify the electric and magnetic vacua for each value of k separately.\nWe next show that the detailed form of the meson matrix one finds in the electric\nand magnetic descriptions is indeed the same for each k. To facilitate the comparison, we\nneed to translate the results of the electric analysis, which give the auxiliary gauge singlet\nmeson matrix N to those for the meson matrix M (1.3). The equation of motion of N\narising from the superpotential (2.6) gives the relation between the two:\nM\n= me INf \u2212 \u03b1e N .\n\u039b\n\n(2.44)\n\nPlugging (2.42), (2.43) into (2.44) we find the following relations between the eigenvalues:\nx =\u039b(me \u2212 \u03b1e xe ) ,\ny =\u039b(me \u2212 \u03b1e ye ) .\n\n(2.45)\n\nThese relations can be simplified by recalling that xe and ye satisfy an analog of (2.19)\nobtained by making the replacements (2.41),\nxe + y e =\n\nme\n\u03b1e\n\n(2.46)\n\nusing which we can rewrite (2.45) as\nx =\u03b1e \u039bye ,\n\n(2.47)\n\ny =\u03b1e \u039bxe .\n\nThe non-trivial check is that the polynomial equation satisfied by x, y, (2.37), and the\ncorresponding equation for xe , ye ,\nN \u2212Nc \u2212k k\u2212Nc\nye\n\nxe f\n\n3(Nf \u2212Nc )\u2212Nf\n\n= (+\u03b1e )Nc \u039bm\n\n(2.48)\n\nare compatible for all k. Plugging (2.47) into (2.37) and using the scale matching condition\n(2.2) as well as (2.7) one finds that this is indeed the case.\n2.5. The classical limit\nIn the previous subsections we found that the number of supersymmetric vacua of the\ndeformed SQCD system described by (2.3) \u2013 (2.6) is given by (2.14). For Nf \u2265 2Nc it\nagrees with the classical analysis of the magnetic theory, while in the electric description\n12\n\n\fsome of the vacua exist only in the quantum theory and go off to infinity in the classical\nlimit. For Nf \u2264 2Nc it is the other way around.\n\nTo see how this happens in detail, we can take the classical limit of our general\n\nresults. Consider, for example, the limit in which the magnetic theory becomes classical,1\ne \u2212N\n3N\n3N \u2212N\n\u039bm c f \u2192 0. In this limit (which is equivalent via (2.2) to \u039be c f \u2192 \u221e) the quantum\ncorrections to the classical superpotential vanish (see e.g. (2.35)). To see what happens to\n\nthe quantum vacua, we need to analyze the behavior of the eigenvalues (x, y) of subsection\n2.3 in this limit.\nConsider, for example, the case Nf \u2264 2Nc . The equations for the eigenvalues, (2.19),\n\n(2.37) take different forms for different k. For 0 \u2264 k \u2264 Nf \u2212 Nc one has\n3Nc \u2212Nf\n\nxNc \u2212k = (\u2212\u03b1)Nf \u2212Nc \u039be\n\n\u0010m\n\u03b1\n\n\u2212x\n\n\u0011Nf \u2212Nc \u2212k\n\n.\n\n(2.49)\n\nThis is a polynomial equation of degree Nc \u2212k. The solutions exhibit two types of behavior\n\nin the classical limit. There are Nf \u2212 Nc \u2212 k solutions of the form\nx=\n\nm\n\u2212\u01eb ,\n\u03b1\n\nwith\nNf \u2212Nc \u2212k\n\n\u01eb\n\n\u2243 (\u2212\u03b1)\n\nNc \u2212Nf\n\ny=\u01eb,\n\n\u0010 m \u0011Nc \u2212k\n\u03b1\n\n(2.50)\n\nN \u22123Nc\n\n\u039be f\n\n.\n\n(2.51)\n\nNote that \u01eb \u2192 0 in the classical limit. Thus, these solutions are small deformations of the\n\nclassical solutions found in subsection 2.1.\n\nIn addition, (2.49) has 2Nc \u2212 Nf solutions in which\n3Nc \u2212Nf\n\nx2Nc \u2212Nf \u2243 (\u2212)k \u03b1Nf \u2212Nc \u039be\n\n.\n\n(2.52)\n\nThese solutions go to x = \u221e in the classical limit.\nFor Nf \u2212Nc \u2264 k \u2264\n\nNf\n2\n\n(2.49) is a polynomial equation of degree 2Nc \u2212Nf . Its solutions\n\nhave the form (2.52), so they too go to infinity in the classical limit. The baryonic vacuum\n(2.38) is a small deformation of the classical one.\n\nFor Nf \u2265 2Nc one can perform a similar analysis and verify that all the solutions of\n\n(2.37) are small deformations of the classical ones, as expected.\n1\n\nThe analysis of the classical limit in the electric theory is very similar.\n\n13\n\n\f3. Metastable vacua\nIn the previous section we discussed the supersymmetric ground states of deformed\nSQCD (1.4). In this section, we will see that this theory has many non-supersymmetric\nmetastable ground states as well. As in [7], we will restrict attention to the regime Nf <\n3\nN ,\n2 c\n\nwhere the magnetic theory is free in the infrared, and can be thought of as the\n\neffective low energy description of the asymptotically free electric gauge theory. A similar\nanalysis can be performed in the free electric phase.2\nThe Kahler potential of the singlet meson superfield M in (2.4) in the free magnetic\nphase is expected to take the form\nK=\n\n1\nM \u2020M + * * *\n2\na|\u039be |\n\n(3.1)\n\nnear the origin M = 0.

We will restrict\nto the regime\n\u039bm \u226b \u03bc \u226b \u03bc\u03c6\n\n(3.11)\n\nwhere the first inequality is as in [7], and the second implies that the term proportional\nto \u03bc\u03c6 is a small perturbation of the superpotential considered in [7]. Since in general the\nexpectation value of \u03a6 (3.9) can be large in the regime (3.11), it is convenient to discuss\nseparately the cases n = Nf \u2212 k and n < Nf \u2212 k.\n15\n\n\f3.1. Metastable vacua with n = Nf \u2212 k\nIn this case, the dynamics of the fields \u03a6n , \u03c6, \u03c6\u0303 near the origin of field space is\nobtained from the underlying SU (Nf \u2212 Nc ) gauge theory by giving an expectation value3\n\n\u03bc to k flavors of magnetic quarks q, q\u0303, (3.10). The low energy theory is an SU (Nf \u2212Nc \u2212k)\ngauge theory with Nf \u2212 k = n light flavors, which is infrared free in the regime Nf < 32 Nc .\n\nIts scale, \u039bl , is related to that of the underlying theory, \u039bm , via the scale matching relation\n3(Nf \u2212Nc )\u2212Nf\n\n3(Nf \u2212Nc \u2212k)\u2212n\n\n= \u03bc2k \u039bl\n\n\u039bm\n\n.\n\n(3.12)\n\nA useful way of writing (3.12) is\n\u0012\n\n\u03bc\n\u039bm\n\n\u00132k\n\n=\n\n\u0012\n\n\u039bm\n\u039bl\n\n\u00133(Nf \u2212Nc \u2212k)\u2212n\n\n.\n\n(3.13)\n\nIn the regime (3.11), the left hand side of (3.13) is very small. Since the power on the right\nhand side is negative, we conclude that \u039bm \u226b \u039bl . Using the fact that (3.12) also implies\nthat\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03bc\n\u039bl\n\n\u00132k\n\n=\n\n\u0012\n\n\u039bm\n\u039bl\n\n\u00133(Nf \u2212Nc )\u2212Nf\n\n(3.14)\n\nwe conclude that the hierarchy of scales is\n\u03bc \u226a \u039bl \u226a \u039bm .\n\n(3.15)\n\nThus, we see that as long as \u03bc \u226a \u039bm , the gauge dynamics is weakly coupled for all\nenergies well below \u039bm . At energies above \u03bc, the full magnetic gauge group is restored. At\n\nan energy of order \u03bc the theory crosses over to the one with gauge group SU (Nf \u2212 Nc \u2212 k),\n\nwhich is also infrared free and due to (3.15) is weakly coupled. Therefore, we can mostly\nneglect the gauge dynamics in what follows.\nThe potential for \u03a6n , \u03c6, \u03c6\u0303 near the origin of field space has two relevant contributions.\nOne is the tree level potential that follows from (3.3), (3.5). The second is the one loop\npotential, which to leading order in h,\n\n\u03bc\u03c6\n\u03bc\n\nis identical to that computed in [7], and is given\n\nby\nV1\u2212loop = b|h2 \u03bc|2 Tr\u03a6\u2020n \u03a6n\n3\n\n(3.16)\n\nIn the regime (3.11), the expectation value of q is such that the corrections to the Kahler\n\npotential discussed around eq.

To avoid tachyons one must have\n\u03bc\u03c6\n\u03bc\n\n2\n\n>\n\n|bh|2\n\u2243 |bh|2 .\n1 \u2212 b|h|2\n\nThe condition (3.22) is compatible with |h|,\n\n\u03bc\u03c6\n\u03bc\n\n(3.22)\n\nbeing arbitrarily small. If it is satisfied,\n\nthe quarks \u03c6, \u03c6\u0303 are massive, and the vacuum (3.19) is locally stable.\nFor k < Nf \u2212Nc \u22121, this vacuum contains an unbroken SU (Nf \u2212Nc \u2212k) gauge theory,\n\nwhich is weakly coupled at energies above the scale of the masses of \u03c6, \u03c6\u0303 (3.21). For energies\n\nwell below these masses this gauge theory confines and has, as before, Nf \u2212 Nc \u2212 k vacua.\n\nFor k = Nf \u2212 Nc \u2212 1 there are no unbroken gauge fields and the theory is weakly coupled\nat long distances.\n\nFor k = Nf \u2212 Nc (the largest value it can take), the fields \u03c6, \u03c6\u0303 in (3.10) do not exist.\n\nHence, in this case the constraint (3.22) is absent and the resulting metastable vacuum\n\nis present for arbitrarily small \u03bc\u03c6 . In the limit \u03bc\u03c6 \u2192 0 it corresponds to the metastable\n\nstate discussed in [7]. Even when (3.22) is satisfied, the vacuum with k = Nf \u2212 Nc is more\n\nlong-lived than those with k < Nf \u2212 Nc since the mode of instability towards condensation\n\nof \u03c6, \u03c6\u0303 is absent in this case.\n\n17\n\n\f3.2. Metastable vacua with n < Nf \u2212 k\nIn order to trust an analysis based on the Kahler potential (3.3) we have to demand\nthat all components of \u03a6 (3.9) are much smaller than \u039bm . In the present case this implies\n\u03bc2\n\u226a h\u039bm .\n\u03bc\u03c6\n\n(3.23)\n\nA useful way of thinking about (3.23) is as the requirement\n\u03bc\u03c6\n\u03bc\n\u226ah\n,\n\u039bm\n\u03bc\nwhich is compatible with all three couplings\n\n\u03bc\n\u039bm ,\n\n(3.24)\n\nh and\n\n\u03bc\u03c6\n\u03bc\n\nbeing small. Furthermore, this\n\nrequirement is very natural in the brane realization of the theory, [31].\nLike in the previous subsection, we would like the gauge dynamics to be weak near\nthe origin of the field space of \u03c6, \u03c6\u0303, \u03a6n , (3.9), (3.10). The dynamics of these fields is\nobtained from the magnetic SU (Nf \u2212 Nc ) gauge theory by giving masses\n\n\u03bc2\n\u03bc\u03c6\n\nto Nf \u2212 k \u2212 n\n\nflavors (see (3.9)) and vacuum expectation values \u03bc to k flavors (see (3.10)). In the regime\n(3.11), the masses are much larger than the expectation values. Thus we can analyze the\nreduction from the SU (Nf \u2212Nc ) magnetic gauge theory to the low energy SU (Nf \u2212Nc \u2212k)\n\none in two steps, by first incorporating the masses, and then the expectation values. We\nwould like the theory to remain weakly coupled throughout this process.\nIn the first step, we go from an SU (Nf \u2212 Nc ) SYM theory with Nf flavors and scale\n\n\u039bm to one with the same gauge group, n + k flavors and scale \u039b1 . The scale matching\nrelation between the two theories is\n3(N \u2212N )\u2212Nf\n\u039bm f c\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03bc2\n\u03bc\u03c6\n\n\u0013Nf \u2212k\u2212n\n\n3(Nf \u2212Nc )\u2212(k+n)\n\n= \u039b1\n\n.\n\n(3.25)\n\nThe fact that the magnetic gauge theory is not asymptotically free is reflected in the power\nof \u039bm on the left hand side of (3.25) being negative. The theory with n + k flavors can\nbe either asymptotically free or not, which is reflected in the fact that the power of \u039b1 on\nthe right hand side can be positive or negative.\nConsider first the case4\nk + n > 3(Nf \u2212 Nc )\n4\n\n(3.26)\n\nIn the free magnetic phase Nf > 3(Nf \u2212 Nc ) there are solutions to this constraint. For large\n\ngeneric Nf , Nc , the number of such solutions is large as well.\n\n18\n\n\fin which it is not asymptotically free. Rewriting (3.25) in the form\n\uf8eb 2 \uf8f6Nf \u2212k\u2212n\n\u0012\n\u00133(Nf \u2212Nc )\u2212k\u2212n\n\u03bc\n\u039b\n\u03bc\u03c6\n1\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n=\n\u039bm\n\u039bm\n\n(3.27)\n\nand using the fact that the left hand side is very small due to (3.23), we conclude that\n\u039b1 \u226b \u039bm .\n\n(3.28)\n\nHence the SU (Nf \u2212 Nc ) gauge dynamics is weakly coupled both for energies larger than\n\u03bc2\n\u03bc\u03c6 ,\n\nfor which the number of flavors is Nf and for lower energies, where it is n + k.\nIn the second step of the reduction we give an expectation value \u03bc to k flavors of\n\nquarks and go down to an SU (Nf \u2212 Nc \u2212 k) gauge theory with n light flavors and scale\n\u039bl . The scale matching relation is (compare to (3.12))\n3(Nf \u2212Nc )\u2212(k+n)\n\n\u039b1\n\n3(Nf \u2212Nc \u2212k)\u2212n\n\n= \u03bc2k \u039bl\n\n.\n\n(3.29)\n\nIn the regime (3.26) the power of \u039bl in (3.29) is negative. Thus, the low energy SU (Nf \u2212\n\nNc \u2212 k) gauge theory with n flavors is weakly coupled below the scale \u039bl . Using the fact\nthat \u03bc \u226a \u039b1 , one can see from (3.29) that \u039bl is in the range\n\u03bc \u226a \u039bl \u226a \u039b1 .\n\n(3.30)\n\nWe see that the theory is weakly coupled at all scales. At energies much above \u03bc it is\ngoverned by the intermediate theory with scale \u039b1 , which as we saw before is weakly\ncoupled. At the energy \u03bc it crosses over to the low energy theory with the scale \u039bl ,\nwhich due to (3.30) is weakly coupled as well. Consequently, the gauge dynamics can\nbe neglected, as in the previous subsection, and one can proceed as there, with similar\nconclusions.\nTo summarize, we find that deformed SQCD in the regime (3.11), (3.24) in coupling\nspace has metastable vacua of the form (3.9), (3.10), (3.19), with k and n satisfying the\nconstraint (3.26). The states with k < Nf \u2212 Nc further require (3.22) for their existence.\n\nThose with k = Nf \u2212 Nc exist throughout this regime.\nThe above analysis can be repeated for the case where the constraint (3.26) is not\n\nsatisfied. One finds that there are regions in parameter space in which the gauge dynamics\nis weakly coupled and metastable states exist. We will not describe the details here.\nFinally, it is interesting to ask what happens to the states with k = Nf \u2212Nc , n < Nc as\n\n\u03bc\u03c6 \u2192 0. As \u03bc\u03c6 decreases, at some point we leave the weak coupling regime (3.23) and the\nanalysis presented above becomes unreliable. The limit \u03bc\u03c6 \u2192 0 involves strongly coupled\n\ndynamics. The brane construction of [31] seems to suggest that these vacua survive in the\nlimit, and thus in massive SQCD there are additional metastable states to those studied\nin [7]. More work is required to resolve this issue conclusively.\n19\n\n\f4. Discussion\nIn this paper we discussed supersymmetric QCD in the presence of the superpotential\n(2.3). We described the supersymmetric vacua of the theory, and generalized the discussion\nof metastable supersymmetry breaking states in [7] to this case. We saw that by tuning\nthe parameters of the theory one can make the non-supersymmetric states arbitrarily longlived. In other regions of parameter space, which can be studied using weakly coupled field\ntheory, many of these states become unstable and disappear.\nThe mechanism for the emergence of metastable states in the theory with \u03b1 6= 0\n\n(2.3) is slightly different than that in the theory with \u03b1 = 0 studied in [7]. There, the\nclassical theory spontaneously broke supersymmetry and had a pseudo-moduli space of\nnon-supersymmetric states. One loop effects lifted the pseudo-moduli space and replaced\nit by an isolated metastable state. In our case, classically there are supersymmetric ground\nstates and no non-supersymmetric metastable states. The latter are due to a competition\nbetween the classical and one loop contributions to the potential. The fact that one can\nignore higher loop contributions to the potential in studying these states is analogous to\nwhat happens in the \u01eb expansion in quantum field theory.\nThe theory with quartic superpotential in (2.3) requires a UV completion. One possibility is to introduce the singlet meson N , and rewrite it as (2.6), which is renormalizable.\nAlternatively, one can proceed as follows. Consider first SQCD with vanishing superpotential and Nf < 3Nc . Due to asymptotic freedom, it approaches a free fixed point in the\nUV, while at long distances it is governed by a non-trivial fixed point, at which the scaling\ndimension of the meson operator (1.3) is smaller than its free field value. For Nf < 2Nc ,\nthe IR dimension is sufficiently small that the quartic perturbation in (2.3) becomes a relevant perturbation of this fixed point. Thus, in this regime the theory with superpotential\n(2.3) is well defined in the UV. Our analysis of metastable states was performed (following\n[7]) in the region Nf < 23 Nc , in which the magnetic theory is infrared free and the electric\ntheory is UV complete.\nA natural generalization of the problem studied here is to higher order superpotentials\nof the form (1.2). The supersymmetric ground states can be analyzed as in section 2. For\nexample, in the mesonic branch, in which the matrix M is non-degenerate, the F-term\nequation (2.36) takes in the general case the form\nn0\nX\n\n1\nmn TrM n =\n(n\n\u2212\n1)!\nn=1\n\n\u0012\n\n20\n\ndetM\n3Nc \u2212Nf\n\n\u039be\n\n\u0013N\n\n1\nf \u2212Nc\n\nINf .\n\n(4.1)\n\n\fSince the left hand side is a polynomial of degree n0 , the matrix M has at most n0 distinct\neigenvalues, (x1 , x2 , * * * , xn0 ). In a general vacuum, it takes the form\nl\n\nM = diag(xl11 , xl22 , * * * , xnn00 )\nwith lj = 0, 1, * * * , Nf and\n\nP\n\nj lj\n\n(4.2)\n\n= Nf . It seems clear that for large N the number of\n\nvacua grows like N n0 , where N denotes collectively Nf , Nc and any linear combinations\n\nof the two. The growth of metastable states with N is even faster since we can follow the\nconstruction of section 3 in each block of M (4.2) separately.\nFrom the perspective of effective field theory it is natural to consider superpotentials\nwith n0 of order Nf , Nc . The number of stable and metastable vacua grows in this case\nat least as fast as N !. To ensure that these vacua are all long-lived one needs to fine\ntune the couplings mn in (4.1) accordingly. Conversely, if the couplings are generic, one\nexpects a distribution of lifetimes, so that at least some of the non-supersymmetric vacua\nare long-lived.\nAn interesting5 generalization of the analysis of this paper is to a system in which the\nSU (Nf )diag symmetry of (1.2) is gauged. This leads to adjoint SQCD, which was studied\nusing a generalization of Seiberg duality in [35-37]. One can use these results as well as\nthose of this paper to analyze the metastable states in this system.\nAs mentioned in the introduction, SQCD with the superpotential (2.3) has a simple\nembedding in string theory, as a low energy theory on a system of intersecting D-branes\nand N S5-branes. In a companion paper [31] we describe this embedding and show that\nmuch of the structure found in the gauge theory description in this paper is nicely realized\nin the brane system.\nAcknowledgements: We thank N.
