The critical properties of the mixed ferro/antiferromagnetic q-state Potts\nmodel on the square lattice are investigated using the numerical transfer matrix\ntechnique. The transition temperature is found to be substantially lower than\npreviously found for q = 3. It is conjectured that there is no transition for q > 3,\nin contradiction with previous results.\n\nPACS numbers: 05.20.-y, 05.50.+q, 64.60.Fr, 75.10.Hk\n\n\f2\n\nLetter to the Editor\n\nIn this letter we investigate the anisotropic q-state Potts model on the square\nlattice[1, 2]. This model is defined by the Hamiltonian\nH=\u2212\n\nX\n\n(Jx \u03b4(\u03c3x,y \u2212 \u03c3x+1,y ) + Jy \u03b4(\u03c3x,y \u2212 \u03c3x,y+1 ))\n\n(1)\n\nx,y\n\nwhere the variables \u03c3x,y may take one of q distinct values, and (x, y) runs over the\ncoordinates of the sites of the lattice.\nMuch is known in the cases when Jx and Jy are of the same sign[2, 3], corresponding\nto the ferromagnetic Potts model (Jx > 0, Jy > 0) and the antiferromagnetic Potts\nmodel (Jx < 0, Jy < 0)[4]. Much less is known in the mixed interaction case, Jx > 0\nand Jy < 0. This will be the object of this letter.\nThere have been a number of attempts to study the mixed interaction model,\nparticularly for the case q = 3[5, 6, 7, 8]. Kinzel, Selke and Wu[5] obtained a candidate\ncritical line by applying a one step Migdal-Kadanoff procedure, thereby mapping the\nmodel onto the ferromagnetic Potts model for which the exact expression for the critical\nline is known. This gave the critical line as\n(1 + exp(\u03b2Jx ))(1 \u2212 exp(\u03b2Jy )) = q.\n\n(2)\n\nSpurred on by the fact that this line is exact for the exactly known q = 2 case, it was\nsuggested that perhaps this equation may remain exact for other values of q. They also\ngave numerical results from Monte Carlo simulations which suggest a transition line at\nlower temperatures than given by (2). The transition line was estimated, however, by\nextrapolating the inverse correlation lengths by hand to zero for lattice sizes less than\nabout 60.\nThe possibility that (2) may correspond to an exact result was refuted by the\nobservation that, except for q = 2, this line does not remain invariant under the\nsymmetries of the model[6]. The symmetries of the model may be used to construct\na symmetry group[9]. The critical line must remain invariant under the action of\nthese symmetries. Using the group of symmetries of the model, Truong[6] constructed\nextended duality relations which he used to look for candidate critical lines. For the\n3-state Potts model this gave:\nexp(\u03b2(Jx + Jy )) + 2 exp(\u03b2Jx ) \u2212 exp(\u03b2Jy ) + 1 = 0.\n\n(3)\n\nInterestingly, this line has the same functional form as the ferromagnetic transition line\nbut with Jy \u2192 \u2212Jy . This line is indeed invariant under all the symmetries of the model,\nbut does not seem to correspond to the transition line when compared with numerical\nresults of Kinzel et al [5, 7], Yasumura[8] and of the present work. This leaves the\ninteresting question: Does this very special line have a corresponding physical meaning?\nThis question remains open.\nIt has been conjectured that the transition for q = 3 is of Kosterlitz-Thouless type.\nThis conjecture is based on the free-fermion approximation applied to a related clockmodel[10], and supported by numerical results on a related one dimensional quantum\nPotts model[11]. In this letter we present convincing evidence that the transition for\n\n\f3\n\nLetter to the Editor\n\nq = 3 is indeed of the Kosterlitz-Thouless type. The critical exponent \u03bd is given as a\nfunction of q and shown to diverge at q = 3. The critical temperatures are also given, as\na function of q, for the case Jx = \u2212Jy > 0. No transition is found for q > 3. This work\nprovides a more accurate estimate of the critical line for q = 3, which is substantially\nlower than previous estimates[5, 7, 8].\nThe numerical results were obtained using the numerical Transfer Matrix Method\ncoupled with phenomenological renormalisation[12]. The method consists of expressing\nthe partition function of an infinite strip of finite width L in terms of a matrix product.\nImposing periodic boundary conditions in the transfer direction (along the direction\ntaken to be infinite), the partition function for the strip may be written\nZL = lim Tr T N .\n\n(4)\n\nN \u2192\u221e\n\nThe thermodynamic limit corresponds to the limit L \u2192 \u221e. For integer values of q > 1 it\nis possible to write the transfer matrices directly in terms of spins. Full details are given\nin Foster, G\u00e9rard and Puha[13]. For non-integer values of q it is necessary to use the\nKasteleyn-Fortuin mapping[14], which gives the Potts model in terms of bond-clusters\non the lattice. Full details on the construction of the transfer matrices for this case are\ngiven in Bl\u00f6te and Nightingale[15].\nIt may be shown that the correlation length in the transfer direction is given by\n!\n\n\u03bb0\n.\n\u03beL = log\n\u03bb1\n\n(5)\n\nAssuming scale invariance at the critical point, finite size estimates of the critical\ntemperature may be identified with solutions of the equation\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u03beL\u2032 (TL,L\n\u03beL (TL,L\n\u2032)\n\u2032)\n=\n.\n(6)\nL\nL\u2032\nThe critical exponent \u03bd may be estimated at the fixed points, solutions of (6), by\n1\n\u03bdL,L\u2032\n\n=\n\nlog\n\n\u0010\n\nd\u03beL d\u03beL\u2032\n/ dT\ndT\n\u0010 \u0011\nlog LL\u2032\n\n\u0011\n\n\u22121\n\n(7)\n\nApplying these results to the case Jx = \u2212Jy > 0 gives the results shown in figure 1\nfor the critical temperature as a function of q. In figure 1 (A) the transfer direction is\ntaken in the x-direction, i.e. parallel to the ferromagnetic interactions, and in figure 1 (B)\nthe transfer direction is taken in the y-direction, i.e. parallel to the antiferromagnetic\ninteractions. In the first case the largest value of q for which a solution was found,\nqmax (L), decreases with L. On the other hand, qmax (L) increases with L in the second.\nThis indicates a value of q, qmax , such that there exists a critical phase transition for\nq \u2264 qmax , but not for q > qmax . Figure 2 shows the values of qmax found in the two\ncases. The curves both extrapolate plausibly to qmax = 3 in the thermodynamic limit.\nUsing the upper line in figure 2 to extrapolate, we qive qmax = 3.00 \u00b1 0.003. This is in\ncontradiction with Yasumura[8], who gives non-zero values of Tc even for q > 3.\nThe finite-size estimates of \u03bd are shown in figure 3 for a transfer direction in the\nx-direction. They converge well to \u03bd = 1 for q = 2, and diverge for q = 3. Table 1\n\n\f4\n\nLetter to the Editor\n\nFigure 1.

The estimates of Tc are\nextrapolated using a Burlich and Stoer algorithm for q = 1, 1.5, 2 and 2.8, but had to\nbe extrapolated graphically for q = 3.\nThe phase diagram for q = 3 is shown in figure 4. The critical line estimates\nobtained are compared with the exact line for Jy /Jx > 0, and shown to converge well,\nand are compared to both proposed critical lines. The convergence is much slower for\nJy /Jx < 0, but clearly rules out both proposed analytic results[5, 6] and the numerical\nresults[5, 7, 8].\nIn summary, in this letter we have addressed numerically the nature of the criticality\nin the only sector of the anisotropic Potts model for which exact solutions do not as\nyet exist: the ferro/antiferromagnetic Potts model. We have given critical temperature\nestimates and estimates of \u03bd as a function q for Jy /Jx = \u22121. We find convincing\nevidence that there exists a qmax around q = 3 above which there is no transition. At\nqmax the value of \u03bd is diverging, consistent with a Kosterlitz-Thouless type transition.\nThis type of transition has already been conjectured for q = 3 using the free-fermion\napproximation[10]. We conjecture, based on this and our numerical data, that qmax = 3.\nThis picture is analogous with what happens in the O(n) spin models in two dimensions,\n\n\f6\n\nLetter to the Editor\nFigure 3.
