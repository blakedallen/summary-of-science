The relations, afterward\ncalled by their names, guarantee the existence of an infinite set of mutually commuting\ncharges which includes the Hamiltonian. This naturally connects the construction to the\nintegrable systems [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. A rich algebraic structure associated with the Dolan-Grady\nrelations was revealed by Perk [2] and Davies [3] who showed that the two operators satisfying\nDGR generate recursively the infinite-dimensional Onsager algebra. The latter appeared in\na seminal work [6] on exact solution of the planar Ising model. The set of commuting charges\nconstructed by Dolan and Grady is linear in generators of the Onsager algebra.\nRecently it was observed [7, 8, 9] that the Dolan-Grady relations arise as necessary conditions for the anomaly-free quantization of pseudo-classical systems with nonlinear holomorphic supersymmetry (n-HSUSY). In accordance with general algebraic construction of\nthe n-HSUSY [9], the Hamiltonian depending on a natural parameter n is a quadratic form\nin two mutually conjugate operators subjected to DGR, whereas the supercharges are (anti)\nholomorphic polynomials of the order n in the same operators. It was shown that the nHSUSY Hamiltonian belongs to an infinite set of mutually commuting even operators being\nquadratic in the Onsager algebra generators, and that these even integrals together with the\nodd supercharges form a polynomial superalgebra of the order n. Realization of this construction in various physical systems [8, 10, 11] revealed an intimate relation of the n-HSUSY\nwith the quasi-exactly solvable (QES) systems [12].\nThough the quadratic set of commuting integrals admits any real and even complex values\nfor the parameter n playing the role of a coupling constant, such an extension breaks the\nnonlinear supersymmetry. Nevertheless, in Ref. [11] it was observed that the quasi exact\nsolvability of the systems associated with the quadratic set of integrals of motion roots not in\nthe n-HSUSY construction itself, but rather in the Dolan-Grady relations. In particular, it\nwas shown that the corresponding systems can be quasi-exactly solvable not only for integer\nvalues of the coupling constant n.\nIn the present paper, exploiting the Dolan-Grady relations we consider a class of U(1)\ngauge invariant quantum mechanical systems on a two-dimensional noncommutative manifold, and demonstrate the quasi exact solvability of their spectral problem for any value of\nthe coupling constant.\nThe layout of the paper is as follows. In Section 2 the basic information on the DolanGrady relations and Onsager algebra necessary for further analysis is presented in the context of integrable systems, n-HSUSY and low-dimensional matrix models. Realization of\nthe Dolan-Grady relations in terms of the generalized deformed oscillator algebra is given\nin Section 3. In Section 4 we construct a U(1) gauge invariant quantum mechanical system\nwith noncommutative coordinates generating the generalized deformed oscillator algebra.\nIn Section 5 we demonstrate that by a reduction to finite-difference equations, the spectral\nproblem of the model on the fuzzy sphere and noncommutative hyperbolic plane can be partially solved for some values of the coupling constant. In Section 6 we develop an algebraic\ncovariant approach to deal with the spectral problem, and show that really our noncommutative system is quasi-exactly solvable for any value of the coupling constant. The obtained\n2\n\n\fresults are summarized in Section 7. In Appendix we discuss a deformation of the sl(2, R)\nscheme associated with the finite-difference quasi-exactly solvable equations.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nDolan-Grady relations\nDolan-Grady relations and Onsager algebra\n\nThe Dolan-Grady relations [1] can be represented in the form [10, 9]\n\u0002 \u0002 \u0002\n\u0003\u0003\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0002 \u0002 \u0002\n\u0003\u0003\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0003\nZ, Z, Z, Z\u0304\n= \u03c9 2 Z, Z\u0304 ,\nZ\u0304, Z\u0304, Z, Z\u0304\n= \u03c9\u0304 2 Z, Z\u0304 .\n\n(2.1)\n\nHere Z and Z\u0304 are some operators which we shall call generating elements while \u03c9 and \u03c9\u0304 are\nsome constants. The nonlinear relations (2.1) can be used to construct the infinite set of\nmutually commuting operators for some integrable systems. In the most elegant way they\ncan be represented in terms of the Onsager algebra [6] spanned by the generators An and\nGn having the commutation relations\n[Am , An ] = 4Gm\u2212n ,\n\n[Gm , An ] = 2An+m \u2212 2An\u2212m ,\n\n[Gm , Gn ] = 0,\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhere m, n \u2208 Z. In fact, the operators A0 \u223c Z\u0304 and A1 \u223c Z are the generating elements\nof the Onsager algebra obeying the Dolan-Grady relations and all the other operators are\ndefined recursively by the relations (2.2) [3]. The values of the constants \u03c9 and \u03c9\u0304 can be\nfixed by rescaling the generators. Then, the infinite set of the mutually commuting operators\nconstructed by Dolan and Grady [1] is represented as\n2Jm = Am + A\u2212m + \u03bb (Am+1 + A1\u2212m ) ,\n\n(2.3)\n\nwhere \u03bb \u2208 R. The commutativity of the operators Jm follows directly from the algebra (2.2).\nNow, treating the operator J0 = A0 + \u03bbA1 as a Hamiltonian, one obtains, generally, an\nintegrable system with infinite number of conserved commuting charges. The charges of the\nform (2.3) appear in various models, such as the Baxter eight-vertex [5], the two-dimensional\nIsing [6] and ZN spin models [4]. The power of the algebraic formulation (2.2), (2.3) is that\nit does not refer to the number of dimensions or to the nature of the space-time manifold\nwhich can be lattice, continuum or loop space.\n\n2.2\n\nStructure of n-HSUSY\n\nIn the systems associated with the linear set of integrals (2.3) the operators Z ( \u223c A1 ) and\nZ\u0304 ( \u223c A0 ) are supposed to be Hermitian. In Ref. [9] it was shown that the set (2.3) is not a\nunique set of mutually commuting operators which can be constructed in terms of generators\nof the Onsager algebra. There exists a set of commuting operators which are quadratic in the\ngenerators of the algebra (6.2). Such commuting operators naturally appear in the scheme\nof the n-HSUSY [8, 10, 9, 11], which we discuss shortly below. Note, that for the systems\nassociated with the quadratic set of commuting operators, the Z, Z\u0304 and the \u03c9, \u03c9\u0304 are usually\nsupposed to be mutually conjugate operators and complex constants, respectively.\n\n3\n\n\fThe Hamiltonian of the system associated with the quadratic set of commuting charges\n(see Eq. (6.2) for their explicit form) reads as\nH\u03bb =\n\n\u0003\n\u03bb\u0002\n1\b\nZ\u0304, Z \u2212\nZ, Z\u0304 ,\n4\n4\n\n(2.4)\n\nwhere a real parameter \u03bb serves as a coupling constant, while mutually conjugate operators\nZ and Z\u0304 are supposed to obey the nonlinear Dolan-Grady relations (2.1)1 .\nWhen the coupling constant is integer, \u03bb = \u00b1n, n \u2208 Z+ , the system (2.4) can be extended\nto the supersymmetric system with the Hamiltonian Hn = Hn \u03c3\u2212 \u03c3+ + H\u2212n \u03c3+ \u03c3\u2212 , \u03c3\u00b1 =\n1\n(\u03c31 \u00b1 i\u03c32 ). In this case the Dolan-Grady relations (2.1) guarantee the existence of the odd\n2\nintegrals of motion (supercharges)\nQ = \u03c3+\n\nn\u22121\nY\u0010\nk=0\n\n\u0011\n\u03c9\nZ \u2212 (2k \u2212 n + 1) ,\n2\n\nQ\u0304 = \u03c3\u2212\n\nn\u22121\nY\u0010\nk=0\n\nZ\u0304 \u2212\n\n\u0011\n\u03c9\u0304\n(2k \u2212 n + 1) .\n2\n\n(2.5)\n\nThe supercharges generate a nonlinear superalgebra of the order n. Its structure and further\ndetails of the algebraic construction underlying the nonlinear holomorphic supersymmetry\ncan be found in Ref. [9].\nThe advantage of the supersymmetric formulation is that the zero modes of the supercharge Q (or Q\u0304) form an invariant subspace with respect to the action of the Hamiltonian\nHn (or H\u2212n ). Furthermore, as a rule the zero modes are easier calculable than the eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian due to the factorized structure of the supercharges. When the\nnumber of the zero modes is finite, then the Hamiltonian is quasi-exactly solvable operator.\nThe information on the functional form of the zero modes is very helpful for solving the\ncorresponding spectral problem.\nAlthough the system (2.4) formally admits an infinite number of integrals, nevertheless,\nfor any given realization of the generating elements in a system with finite number of degrees\nof freedom this infinite set is reduced to a finite set of independent integrals. Such systems\nbeing not integrable in general case, however, reveal a profound connection with quasi-exactly\nsolvable systems [9]. We shall return to this aspect below.\n\n2.3\n\nMatrix models\n\nHere we show that the Dolan-Grady relations can be revealed in some low dimensional matrix\nmodels.\nSo, let us consider a matrix model given by the action\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n\u03bc\n\u03bd\n\u03bc \u03bd\nS = \u2212 Tr\n(2.6)\n[X\u03bc , X\u03bd ] [X , X ] + R\u03bc\u03bd X X ,\n2\nwhere X\u03bc are Hermitian operators on a Hilbert space and R\u03bc\u03bd are c-numbers. The last term\ncan be treated as describing the interaction of the vector field X\u03bc with an external symmetric\n1\n\nIn principle, one can also deal with Hermitian operators Z and Z\u0304. Then the Hamiltonian (and the whole\nset of the integrals (6.2)) is Hermitian if the coupling constant is pure imaginary [9]. However, here we will\nnot discuss such systems.\n\n4\n\n\ffield R\u03bc\u03bd . One can also think that its diagonal part contains the mass term of the vector\nfield. The matrix models of the form (2.6) are widely used in the context of string theories.\nIn the case of positively definite metric the action (2.6) corresponds to the potential part\nof the BFSS model [13] and defines static (vacuum) configurations of the theory. On the\nother hand, for the Lorentz metric the action can be interpreted as an effective theory of the\nreduced model of Yang-Mills theory [14] with the specific interaction. Actually, action (2.6)\nrepresents a slightly modified massive matrix model [15].\nThe action (2.6) leads to the equations of motion\n[X \u03bd , [X\u03bc , X\u03bd ]] + R\u03bc\u03bd X \u03bd = 0.\n\n(2.7)\n\nIn the two-dimensional case Eq. (2.7) can be represented in the form\n[X\u2212 , [X\u2212 , X+ ]] + R+\u2212 X\u2212 + R\u2212\u2212 X+ = 0,\n[X+ , [X+ , X\u2212 ]] + R+\u2212 X+ + R++ X\u2212 = 0,\n\n(2.8)\n\nwhere X\u00b1 = \u221a12 (X1 \u00b1 X2 ) or X\u00b1 = \u221a12 (X1 \u00b1 iX2 ) for the Lorentz or Euclidean metric,\n\u2217\nrespectively. In the first case R++ and R\u2212\u2212 are real constants, while in the latter R\u2212\u2212\n= R++ .\nIt is easy to see that any solution of Eq. (2.8) also obeys the Dolan-Grady relations (2.1)\nwith the identification:\nX\u2212 \u223c Z,\n\nR\u2212\u2212 \u223c \u2212\u03c9 2 ,\n\nX+ \u223c Z\u0304,\n\nR++ \u223c \u2212\u03c9\u0304 2 .\n\nMoreover, note that in the case of positively definite metric and when R++ = R\u2212\u2212 =\n0, the equations (2.8) coincide with the basic commutations relations for the single-mode\nparafermion [16].\nNow let us consider the following modification of the three-dimensional matrix model [17]\n\u0013\n\u0012\n4\n1\n2\n[Xj , Xk ] \u2212 i\u03b1\u01ebjkl Xj Xk Xl + Rjk Xj Xk ,\n(2.9)\nS = \u2212 Tr\n2\n3\nwhere \u03b1 and Rjk are real numbers and we imply positively definite metric. This model can\nbe treated as the matrix model corresponding to the usual Yang-Mills theory with ChernSimon term. As before, the quadratic term in action (2.9) represents a specific interaction\nwith an external symmetric field. The equations of motion are\n[[Xk , Xj ], Xk ] \u2212 i\u03b1\u01ebjkl [Xk , Xl ] + Rjk Xk = 0.\n\n(2.10)\n\n[X0 , X\u00b1 ] = \u00b1\u03b2X\u00b1\n\n(2.11)\n\nImposing the condition\nwith \u03b2 \u2208 R on the components X0 , X\u00b1 , the equation for j = 0 is satisfied identically for\n\u03b2 = \u03b1, R0i = 0. The equations of motion for X\u00b1 have the form (2.8) with the substitution\nR+\u2212 \u2192 R+\u2212 + \u03b1. Therefore, the Dolan-Grady relations arise in this model as well. Again,\nlike in model (2.6), for R\u00b1\u00b1 = 0 the equations of motion for the components X\u00b1 take the\nform of basic commutation relations of the single-mode parafermion.\n\n5\n\n\f3\n3.1\n\nGeneralized deformed oscillator\nMain definitions\n\nAnother basic ingredient we shall use in what follows is the generalized deformed oscillator\n(GDO). Therefore, in this subsection we present a brief description of the construction (see\nalso Refs. [18, 19]).\nThe generalized deformed oscillator is defined by the algebra generated by the set of\noperators {11I, z, z\u0304, N} satisfying the relations\n[N, z] = \u2212\u03b8z,\n\n[N, z\u0304] = \u03b8z\u0304,\n\nz\u0304z = F (N),\n\nzz\u0304 = F (N + \u03b8),\n\n(3.1)\n\nwhere N is the number operator and the structure function F (.) is an analytic function\nwith the properties F (0) = 0 and F (n\u03b8) > 0, n = 1, . . .. The structure function F (.) is\ncharacteristic to the deformation scheme. Here we have introduced a positive real parameter\n\u03b8, which will serve later on as a measure of noncommutativity.\nThe operators z, z\u0304 obey the commutation relation\n[z, z\u0304] = \u03b8\u2206+ F (N).\n\n(3.2)\n\nBy symbols \u2206\u00b1 we denote the forward and backward difference derivatives\n\u2206+ f (N) =\n\nf (N + \u03b8) \u2212 f (N)\n,\n\u03b8\n\n\u2206\u2212 f (N) =\n\nf (N) \u2212 f (N \u2212 \u03b8)\n.\n\u03b8\n\n(3.3)\n\nThe generalized deformed oscillator algebra can be naturally represented on the Fock\nspace of the eigenstates of the number operator N, N|ni = n\u03b8|ni, hn|mi = \u03b4nm , n = 1, . . .,\nwith the vacuum state defined as z|0i = 0. The eigenstates are given by\n1\n|ni = p\nz\u0304 n |0i,\nF (n\u03b8)!\n\nF (n\u03b8)! \u2261\n\nn\nY\n\nF (k\u03b8).\n\n(3.4)\n\nk=1\n\nThe operators z and z\u0304 are the annihilation and creation operators of the oscillator algebra,\np\np\nz\u0304|ni = F ((n + 1)\u03b8)|n + 1i.\n(3.5)\nz|ni = F (n\u03b8)|n \u2212 1i,\nIn what follows we shall denote the Fock space defined by (3.4), (3.5) as HF . On this space\nthe operators z and z\u0304 are mutually adjoint, z\u0304 = z \u2020 .\nNote that when the characteristic function obeys the condition\nF ((p + 1)\u03b8) = 0\n\n(3.6)\n\nfor some p \u2208 N, the creation-annihilation operators satisfy the nilpotency relations z p+1 =\nz\u0304 p+1 = 0. This means that the corresponding representation is (p + 1)-dimensional and we\nhave a parafermionic type system of the order p.\n\n6\n\n\f3.2\n\nThe Dolan-Grady relations in terms of GDO\n\nThe simplest realization of the Dolan-Grady relations (2.1) can be obtained in terms of the\ngeneralized deformed oscillator:\nZ = z,\n\nZ\u0304 = z\u0304.\n\n(3.7)\n\nAs a consequence of the natural grading of the GDO algebra defined by the operator N, for\nthis representation of the generating elements Z and Z\u0304 it is possible to realize the DolanGrady relations only in its contracted form, \u03c9 = 0 [9],\n\u0002 \u0002 \u0002\n\u0003\u0003\u0003\n\u0002 \u0002 \u0002\n\u0003\u0003\u0003\nZ, Z, Z, Z\u0304\n= 0,\nZ\u0304, Z\u0304, Z, Z\u0304\n= 0.\n(3.8)\n\nOn the other hand, these relations lead to the restriction on the structure function in the\nform of the finite-difference equation:\n\u22063+ F (N) = 0.\n\n(3.9)\n\nSince the structure function has to vanish at zero, the general solution of the equation (3.9)\nis\nF (N) = c1 N 2 + c0 \u03b8N,\n(3.10)\nwhere ad interim c0 , c1 \u2208 R. Three different cases corresponding to the solution (3.10) should\nbe distinguished:\n1. The case c1 = 0, c0 6= 0 corresponds to the usual oscillator given by the Heisenberg\nalgebra. The nonlinear supersymmetry for such a system was discussed in Ref. [7].\n2. For c1 > 0 the polynomial (3.10) is a structure function when the parameters obey\nthe inequality c1 + c0 > 0. Then the generalized oscillator realizes the half-bounded\ninfinite-dimensional discrete series of the unitary representations of the sl(2, R) algebra.\nThe generators are, correspondingly, L0 = \u03b8\u2206+ F (N), L\u2212 = z, L+ = z\u0304, or L0 =\n\u2212\u03b8\u2206+ F (N), L\u2212 = z\u0304, L+ = z for the series D\u03b1+ or D\u03b1\u2212 [20] with \u03b1 = (c0 + c1 )/(2c1).\n3. In the case c1 < 0, for the solution (3.10) to be a structure function one has to impose\nthe additional condition (3.6). This leads to quantization of one of the parameters,\nc0 = \u2212(p + 1)c1 , and results in the (p + 1)-dimensional representation of the su(2)\nalgebra with the generators L\u2212 = z, L+ = z\u0304 and L3 = \u03b8\u2206+ F (N). This is the singlemode parafermion case.\n\n4\n\nNoncommutative quantum mechanics and DGR\n\nLet us consider a 2D quantum mechanical system with noncommutative complex-like coordinates z, z\u0304 obeying the GDO algebra (3.1) realized on the Hilbert space HF . The operatorvalued functions \u03a8(z\u0304, z) on HF with a finite norm with respect to the scalar product\n\u0001\n(\u03a6, \u03a8) \u2261 TrHF \u03a6\u2020 (z\u0304, z)\u03a8(z\u0304, z)\n(4.1)\n7\n\n\fwill be treated by us as the states of the noncommutative system. Here the symbols TrHF\nand \u2020 denote the usual trace and Hermitian conjugation operations on the space HF (3.4).\nThe operator-valued functions with the finite norm themselves form a Hilbert space, which\nwe shall denote as \u0124F .\nThe corresponding derivative operators on the space \u0124F can be defined as\n\u2202 \u0304 \u2261 \u03b8\u22121 ad z.\n\n\u2202 \u2261 \u2212\u03b8\u22121 ad z\u0304,\n\n(4.2)\n\nThese operators possess the usual conjugation property \u2202 \u2020 = \u2212\u2202 \u0304 with respect to the scalar\nproduct (4.1). It is worth noting that the derivative operators do not commute if the structure\n \u0304 = \u03b8\u22121 ad \u2206+ F (N).\nfunction F (N) is different from a linear one. Indeed, [\u2202, \u2202]\nLet us introduce a U(1) gauge interaction associated with an external magnetic field.\nThe noncommutative system admits the following two types of gauge transformations:\n\u03a8\u2032 (z\u0304, z) = U(z\u0304, z)\u03a8(z\u0304, z),\n\n\u03a8\u2032\u2020 (z\u0304, z) = \u03a8\u2020 (z\u0304, z)U \u2020 (z\u0304, z),\n\n(4.3)\n\nor\n\u03a8\u2032 (z\u0304, z) = U(z\u0304, z)\u03a8(z\u0304, z)U \u2020 (z\u0304, z)\n\n(4.4)\n\nwith U(z\u0304, z) being a unitary operator. The scalar product (4.1) is invariant with respect\nto the both transformations. In the commutative limit, \u03b8 \u2192 0, the transformation (4.3) is\nreduced to the usual U(1) gauge transformation while (4.4) becomes trivial.\nWe realize the generating elements from (2.4) as the gauge covariant derivatives\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0003\nZ = \u2202 + \u03c1 A(z\u0304, z) ,\nZ\u0304 = \u2212 \u2202 \u0304 + \u03c1 \u0100(z\u0304, z) ,\n(4.5)\nwhere the operator \u03c1[O], O \u2208 {A(z\u0304, z), \u0100(z\u0304, z)}, acts on \u03a8, \u03a8\u2020 as\n\n\u03c1[O]\u03a8\u2020 = \u2212\u03a8\u2020 O\n\n\u03c1[O]\u03a8 = O\u03a8,\n\nmanifesting the fact that the states \u03a8 and \u03a8\u2020 carry the charges of the opposite sign. The\noperator-valued functions A and \u0100 = A\u2020 are the components of the noncommutative vector\ngauge potential corresponding to the case of stationary magnetic field, and we assume that\nthe gauge coupling constant (\"electric charge\") and the mass parameter are equal to unit,\ne = m = 1. Under the both gauge transformations (4.3) and (4.4) the components of the\nnoncommutative vector potential are transformed in the usual way\n \u0304 \u2020.\n\u0100\u2032 = U \u0100U \u2020 \u2212 U \u2202U\n\nA\u2032 = UAU \u2020 + U\u2202U \u2020 ,\n\nThe commutator of the generating elements has the form\n\nWe will treat\n\nB \u2261 [Z, Z\u0304] = \u2212 \u03b8\u22121 ad \u2206+ F (N) + B(z\u0304, z).\n\n(4.6)\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\n \u0304 + A, \u0100\nB(z\u0304, z) \u2261 \u2202 \u0100 + \u2202A\n\n(4.7)\n\nas an external quasi-magnetic field since in the commutative limit the commutator in (4.7)\ndisappears and it turns into a true magnetic field. Nevertheless, in the noncommutative case\nthe quantity (4.7) transforms as a connection under the gauge transformations. Actually, if\n8\n\n\fone considers the operator N as the third dependent coordinate, then the quantity (4.7) is\nthe N-th component of the gauge connection.\nLet us suppose that the magnetic field depends on N only. This corresponds to an axially\nsymmetric field in the commutative limit. The following choice of the gauge,\nA(z\u0304, z) = z\u0304f (N),\n\n\u0100(z\u0304, z) = f (N)z,\n\n(4.8)\n\nwhere f (.) is a real function, guarantees such a dependence of the magnetic field. Indeed, in\nthe gauge (4.8) the quasi-magnetic field (4.7) acquires the form\n\u0001\nB(N) = \u2206+ F (N)f (N \u2212 \u03b8) (2 \u2212 \u03b8f (N \u2212 \u03b8)) .\n(4.9)\n\nNow let us analyze the restrictions which follow from the Dolan-Grady relations. In the\nrepresentation (4.5) the l.h.s. of Eq. (2.1) can be rewritten as follows\n\u0001\nl.h.s.(2.1) = \u2212 \u03b8\u22121 ad z\u0304 2 \u22063+ F (N) + z\u0304 2 (1 \u2212 \u03b8f (N + \u03b8)) (1 \u2212 \u03b8f (N)) \u22062+ B(N)\n(4.10)\n\u0001\n+ z\u0304 2 f (N) + f (N + \u03b8)(1 \u2212 \u03b8f (N)) \u22063+ F (N).\n\nThe comparison of the first terms in (4.6) and (4.10) leads to the conclusion that the DolanGrady relations (2.1) with \u03c9 6= 0 can be satisfied only when the structure function of the\nGDO algebra is linear. On the other hand, for \u03c9 = 0 the expression (4.10) vanishes only\nwhen the structure function obeys the equation (3.9). This leads to the following constraint\non the quasi-magnetic field:\n(4.11)\n\u22062+ B(N) = 0.\n\nIn other words, the quasi-magnetic field has to be at most linear in N. The function f (N)\nappeared in the gauge (4.8) can be found from (4.9) taking into account the constraint (4.11).\nThe classification of the GDO algebra with the quadratic structure function (3.10) was\npresented in the previous section. In accordance with it, the noncommutative coordinates\nz, z\u0304 and the operator N form the su(2), sl(2, R), or the Heisenberg algebras. Therefore,\nthe noncommutative system given by the Hamiltonian (2.4) in the representation (4.5) can\nbe treated, correspondingly, as the system on the fuzzy sphere S\u03b82 , on the noncommutative\nhyperbolic plane H\u03b82 , or on the noncommutative plane R2\u03b8 .\nNote that since the structure function is quadratic, the simplest solution for f (N) is\nf (N) = f = const.\n\n(4.12)\n\nIndeed, one can verify that in this case the quasi-magnetic field (4.7) is a linear function,\nB(N) = f (2 \u2212 \u03b8f )(2c1 N + (c0 + c1 )\u03b8),\n\n(4.13)\n\nand hence, it obeys the equation (4.11). Below we shall consider only the solution (4.12),\n(4.13). Later on we shall show that for the given solution the expression (4.13) coincides\nwith a covariant definition of the magnetic field in the gauge (4.8).\nFrom the explicit form of the magnetic field (4.13) it follows that the parameter f has\ntwo special values f = 0 and f = 2\u03b8\u22121 . The first case is rather trivial. It corresponds to the\nmodel without gauge interaction (a free model (2.4) on the corresponding noncommutative\n9\n\n\fspace). In the second case the magnetic field (4.13) vanishes. Nevertheless, the gauge\ninteraction still is present in the model since the corresponding connection (4.8) with f 6= 0\nis not trivial. This resembles the famous Aharonov-Bohm effect but its origin roots here\nin the noncommutativity of the configuration space. As we shall see, there is also another\ncritical value of the parameter, f = \u03b8\u22121 . For this value the quasi-magnetic field is nontrivial\nwhile the system is degenerate. Such a case, in turn, resembles the situation with existence\nof the critical value of the constant external magnetic field being coherent with the value of\nthe parameter of noncommutativity (see, e.g. [21, 22]).\nIn the next section we shall discuss the spectral problem for the noncommutative system\n(2.4) on the fuzzy sphere and noncommutative hyperbolic plane.\n\n5\n\nReduction to finite-difference QES systems\n\nHere we show that the noncommutative system given by the Hamiltonian (2.4) is quasiexactly solvable for some values of the coupling constant. It is demonstrated by a reduction\nof the Hamiltonian to one-dimensional finite-difference QES operators.\nFirst of all, one can notice that in the gauge (4.8) the operator ad N commutes with\nthe Hamiltonian. One can refer this property to the existence in the system of an \"axial\"\nsymmetry. Therefore, the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian can be represented in the form\n\u03a8L (z\u0304, z) = z\u0304 m \u03c8(N),\n\nor\n\n\u03a8R (z\u0304, z) = \u03c8(N)z m ,\n\n(5.1)\n\nwhere m \u2208 Z+ . Evidently, these operator functions are eigenstates of the operator ad N. We\nshall call the functions \u03a8L and \u03a8R the left and right modes.\nNow it is clear enough that the corresponding 2D spectral equation with the eigenstates\nof the form (5.1) can be reduced to a one-dimensional problem. But unlike the commutative case, here the corresponding 1D system is represented by a finite-difference equation.\nOne notes that such a situation is typical for any noncommutative system with the \"axial\"\nsymmetry.\nThe Hamiltonian (2.4) is associated with the nonlinear holomorphic supersymmetry for\ninteger values of the coupling constant. The zero modes of the supercharge Q form an\ninvariant subspace of the Hamiltonian. We will use their functional form as an anzatz for\ninvestigating the spectral problem with arbitrary coupling constant.\nLet us temporarily set \u03bb = n \u2208 N. For the left mode wave functions represented in the\nfactorized form\n\u03a8L (z\u0304, z) = z\u0304 m \u03c6(N)\u03c6(N),\nwith \u03c6(N) obeying the equation\n(\u2206+ + f )\u03c6(N) = 0,\n\n(5.2)\n\nthe zero mode equation Z n \u03a8L = 0 is reduced to\n(1 \u2212 \u03b8f )n \u2206n+ \u03c6(N) = 0.\nFor \u03b8f 6= 1 this equation gives the polynomial solution \u03c6(N) = Pn\u22121 (N), where Pk (.) denotes\na polynomial of the k-th degree. For \u03b8f = 1 there are no zero modes at all, i.e. there are no\nbounded (normalized) states in the system.\n10\n\n\fThe existence of the zero modes means that the Hamiltonian is quasi-exactly solvable\nwhen the coupling constant \u03bb is a nonnegative integer. Now we investigate the question on\nexistence of the zero modes for an arbitrary value of the coupling constant. For the left\nL\nmodes the Hamiltonian can be reduced, H\u03bb \u03a8L (z\u0304, z) \u2192 H\u03bb,m\n\u03c8(N), to the one-dimensional\nfinite-difference operator\n\u0001\nL\nH\u03bb,m\n= (\u03b8f \u2212 1) F (N) \u2206+ \u2206\u2212 + (m + 1)F (N) \u2206+ + f 2 F (N)\n(5.3)\n\u0001\n1\n+ f (2m + \u03bb + 1)\u03b8f \u2212 2(m + \u03bb) \u2206+ F (N) + const\n2\nwith the function F (N) defined by\nF (N) = \u2206+ F (N) +\n\nm\u03b8 2\n\u2206 F (N).\n2 +\n\n(5.4)\n\nFor \u03b8f = 1 the reduced Hamiltonian (5.3) is a multiplicative operator. The generating elements of the form (4.5) are multiplicative operators as well, Z\u03a8 \u223c \u03a8z\u0304, Z\u0304\u03a8 \u223c \u03a8z. Actually,\nthis representation of the Dolan-Grady relations becomes equivalent to the representation\n(3.7). However, the Hamiltonian (2.4) acting on the Hilbert space \u0124F has a trivial dynamics\nin this case. Therefore, later on we shall always assume \u03b8f 6= 1.\nThe leading term of the \"potential\" in (5.3) is proportional to the structure function\nF (N). We represent the function \u03c8(N) in the factorized form\n\u03c8(N) = \u03c6(N)\u03c6(N),\n\n(5.5)\n\nwhere the function \u03c6(N) is supposed to obey the equation\n(\u2206+ + \u03b3)\u03c6(N) = 0\n\n(5.6)\n\nwith a real parameter \u03b3. This equation is a slight modification of Eq. (5.2). The factorization\n(5.5) allows us to discard the leading term in the equation for \u03c6(N) when the constant \u03b3\nobeys the algebraic equation\n\u03b32\nf2\n=\n,\n(5.7)\n1 \u2212 \u03b8\u03b3\n1 \u2212 \u03b8f\nthat gives a possibility to look for the solutions \u03c6(N) in a polynomial form.\nThe first evident solution of the equation (5.7)\n\u03b3=f\n\n(5.8)\n\ncorresponds to the zero modes found above. Indeed, the reduction\nL\n\u2032\nH\u03bb,m\n\u03c8(N) \u2192 H\u03bb,m\n\u03c6(N)\n\nresults in the one-dimensional finite-difference operator\n\u2032\nH\u03bb,m\n= \u2212 F (N) \u2206+ \u2206\u2212 \u2212 (m + 1)(1 \u2212 \u03b8f )2 F (N) \u2206+ + f (2 \u2212 \u03b8f ) T\u03bb + const.\n\n(5.9)\n\nHere, the function F (N) is defined by (5.4), while the operator T\u03bb is given by\nT\u03bb = F (N)\u2206+ \u2212 \u03bb\u2206+ F (N).\n11\n\n(5.10)\n\n\fLet Pk (x), k \u2208 Z+ , denotes the space of all the polynomials in x up to the order k.\nOn such spaces the finite-difference derivatives act similarly to the usual derivative, \u2206\u00b1 :\nPk (N) \u2192 Pk\u22121 (N). Using this fact and that the function F (N) is quadratic while F (N) is\nlinear, one can notice that the spaces Pk (N) are invariant subspaces of the operator (5.9)\nexcept for the third term. On the other hand, the space Pn (N) is an invariant subspace\nof the operator T\u03bb for any \u03bb = n \u2208 Z+ . As a result, for nonnegative integer values of the\ncoupling constant the operator (5.9) is quasi-exactly solvable [12].\nThe second solution of the equation (5.7) is\n\u03b3=\n\nf\n.\n\u03b8f \u2212 1\n\n(5.11)\n\nAs a consequence, the reduced Hamiltonian acting on \u03c6(N) reads as\n\u0001\n\u2032\u2032\nH\u03bb,m\n= \u2212(1 \u2212 \u03b8f )2 F (N) \u2206+ \u2206\u2212 + (m + 1)F (N) \u2206+ \u2212f (2 \u2212 \u03b8f ) T\u2212\u03bb\u22122m + const. (5.12)\n\nTherefore, this operator is quasi-exactly solvable if one imposes the condition \u03bb + 2m \u2208 Z\u2212\non the coupling constant.\nNow we pass over to the discussion of the right modes. Unfortunately, in this case we\nfailed to find the zero modes of the supercharge Q in a closed form. Therefore, we shall\ninvestigate the conjectural partial algebraization of this part of the spectrum from viewpoint\nof the reduction of the Hamiltonian.\nFor the right modes (5.1) the 2D Hamiltonian is reduced to the finite-difference operator\n\u0001\nR\nH\u03bb,m\n= (\u03b8f \u2212 1) F (N) \u2206+ \u2206\u2212 + (m + 1) F (N) \u2206+ + f 2 F (N)\n(5.13)\n\u0001\n1\n+ f (\u03bb + 1)\u03b8f + 2(m \u2212 \u03bb) \u2206+ F (N) + const.\n2\n\nThis Hamiltonian can be obtained from (5.3) by means of the formal change \u03bb \u2192 \u03bb \u2212 2m.\nUsing this property, one can reproduce all the corresponding results for the right modes.\nThe factorization (5.5) with the conditions (5.6) and (5.7) for the solution (5.8) leads to the\nfinite-difference operator containing the term proportional to the operator T\u03bb\u22122m . Hence,\nfor \u03bb \u2212 2m \u2208 Z+ the polynomial space P\u03bb\u22122m (N) is an invariant subspace of the obtained\noperator, i.e. it is QES operator. For the second solution (5.11) the reduced Hamiltonian\ncontains T\u2212\u03bb , and so, it is QES operator for non-positive integer values of the coupling\nconstant.\nAll the reduced finite-difference operators, (5.9), (5.12) and those for the right modes,\ncan be represented as QES operators of the form (A.10) with the following coefficients:\n1. The solution (5.8):\nc1\nc1\n(1 \u2212 \u03b8f )2 ,\nb+\nb+\nb\u2212\n,\n0 = c0 ,\n\u2212 = 0,\n+ =\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\n2\n2\nb\u2212\nb\u2212\n0 = \u2212 (c0 + 2(m + 1)c1 ) (1 \u2212 \u03b8f ) ,\n\u2212 = \u2212 \u03b8(m + 1) (c0 + (m + 1)c1 ) (1 \u2212 \u03b8f ) ,\na1 = 0,\n\na2 = 0,\n\nb+\n+ = \u2212\n\nwhere N = \u03bb or N = \u03bb \u2212 2m for the left or right modes, respectively;\n\n12\n\n\f2. The solution (5.11):\na1 = 0,\nb\u2212\n+ =\n\nc1\n2\n,\nb+\nb+\n0 = c0 (1 \u2212 \u03b8f ) ,\n\u2212 = 0,\n\u03b8\nb\u2212\nb\u2212\n0 = \u2212 c0 \u2212 2(m + 1)c1 ,\n\u2212 = \u2212 \u03b8(m + 1) (c0 + (m + 1)c1 ) ,\n\na2 = 0,\n\nc1\n(1 \u2212 \u03b8f )2 ,\n\u03b8\n\nb+\n+ = \u2212\n\nwhere N = \u2212 \u03bb \u2212 2m or N = \u2212\u03bb for the left or right modes, respectively.\nIt is worth noting that for \u03b8f = 2 the both operators (5.9) and (5.12) are exactly solvable\nsince the term proportional to T\u03bb vanishes.\nLet us briefly discuss a normalizability condition for the found solutions. Since the\nfunction \u03c6(N) is a polynomial, the normalizability has to be provided by the factor \u03c6(N).\nThe solution of the equation (5.6) has the form \u03c6(N) \u223c (1 \u2212 \u03b8\u03b3)N . Therefore, the norm of\nthe corresponding state \u03a8 \u2208 \u0124F can be represented as\nk\u03a8k\u0124F = TrHF (\u03a8\u2020 \u03a8) = CN\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nnK (1 \u2212 \u03b8\u03b3)2n + . . . .\n\n(5.14)\n\nn=1\n\nHere the dots denote less divergent terms in the sense that if the first term in (5.14) is convergent, then the others are convergent as well. The factor CN is related to the normalization\nconstant and the integer parameter K is defined by the type of solution. The requirement\nof convergence of the series leads to the condition\n|1 \u2212 \u03b8\u03b3| < 1.\n\n(5.15)\n\nTherefore, we have to impose the following restrictions on the values of the parameter f :\n\u03b8f \u2208 (0, 2) for the solution (5.8), and \u03b8f \u2208 (\u2212\u221e, 0) \u222a (2, \u221e) for the solution (5.11).\nOf course, in the case of the fuzzy sphere the norm (5.14) is finite because of the finitness\nof the corresponding Hilbert space, and no additional condition appears for it.\n\n6\n\nIntrinsic algebra and quasi exact solvability\n\nIn this section we show that the noncommutative system under consideration really is quasiexactly solvable for any value of the coupling constant. The demonstration is realized in\nterms of an intrinsic algebra.\n\n6.1\n\nIntrinsic algebra\n\nIn general, the operators Z0 \u2261 Z and Z\u03040 \u2261 Z\u0304 together with the contracted Dolan-Grady\nrelations (3.8) recursively generate the infinite-dimensional contracted Onsager algebra [9]:\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0003\nZk , Z\u0304l = Bk+l+1 ,\n[Zk , Bl ] = Zk+l ,\nBk , Z\u0304l = Z\u0304k+l ,\n(6.1)\n\u0002\n\u0003\n[Zk , Zl ] = 0,\nZ\u0304k , Z\u0304l = 0,\n[Bk , Bl ] = 0,\nwhere k, l \u2208 Z+ and B0 \u2261 0 is implied. This algebra can be extended discarding the last\ncondition, i. e. by treating B0 as a nontrivial generator. Then the extended algebra will be\n13\n\n\fgenerated by the set Z, Z\u0304 and B0 . The element B0 splits up the contracted Onsager algebra\ninto the three subalgebras of the grade +1, 0 and \u22121, given, correspondingly, by the span\nof Z\u0304m , Bm and Zm . In other words, the generator B0 is a grading element which provides\nthe extended algebra with the triangular decomposition. This grading is different from that\nconsidered in Ref. [9].\nThe algebra (6.1) admits the infinite set of the commuting quadratic charges\nk\n\nJk\u03bb\n\nk\u22121\n\n1 X\b\n1X\n\u03bb\n=\nZ\u0304p\u22121, Zk\u2212p \u2212\nBp Bk\u2212p \u2212 Bk\n2 p=1\n2 p=1\n2\n\n(6.2)\n\nwith k \u2208 Z+ , which contains the Hamiltonian (2.4), J1\u03bb = 2H\u03bb , and the grading operator,\nJ0\u03bb \u223c B0 .\nIn the gauge (4.8) the generating elements of the form (4.5) read as\nZ = \u2212 \u03b8\u22121 ad z\u0304 + f \u03c1[z\u0304],\n\nZ\u0304 = \u2212 \u03b8\u22121 ad z + f \u03c1[z].\n\nThese operators generate the following algebra intrinsic to the noncommutative system:\n[Z, Z\u0304] = 2c1 (S + f (2 \u2212 \u03b8f ) G) ,\n[D, D\u0304] = \u22122c1 \u03b8G,\n[Z, D\u0304] = 2c1 (1 \u2212 \u03b8f ) G,\n[G, D] = \u03b8D,\n[D, Z\u0304] = 2c1 (1 \u2212 \u03b8f ) G,\n[D\u0304, G] = \u03b8D\u0304,\n[Z, G] = (1 \u2212 \u03b8f ) D,\n[S, D\u0304] = D\u0304,\n[G, Z\u0304] = (1 \u2212 \u03b8f ) D\u0304,\n[D, S] = D,\n[Z, S] = Z,\n[S, Z\u0304] = Z\u0304,\n[S, G] = [Z, D] = [Z\u0304, D\u0304] = 0,\n\n(6.3)\n\nwhere the operators D\u0304, D, G and S in the chosen gauge are\nD = z\u0304,\n\nD\u0304 = z,\n\nG=N +\u03b8\n\nc0 + c1\n,\n2c1\n\nS = \u2212\u03b8\u22121 ad N.\n\nThe algebra has the following two Casimir operators:\n\b\nC1 = D\u0304, D \u2212 2c1 G2 ,\n\b\nC2 = \u03b8Z\u0304 + (1 \u2212 \u03b8f )D\u0304, \u03b8Z + (1 \u2212 \u03b8f )D \u2212 2c1 (\u03b8S + G)2 .\n\n(6.4)\n\n(6.5)\n\nThe algebra (6.3) is sl(2, R) \u2295 sl(2, R) (c1 > 0) or su(2) \u2295 su(2) (c1 < 0). In the chosen\ngauge it can be shown by representing the generators of the algebra in the form Lz , Lz\u0304 , LN\nand Rz , Rz\u0304 , RN , where La and Ra denote the left and right multiplications. In the given\nrepresentation the Casimir operators (6.5) are equal to the same number,\n\u0001\n\u03b82 2\nC1 = C2 =\nc1 \u2212 c20 .\n2c1\n\n(6.6)\n\nIt is necessary to note that the values \u03b8f = 0, 1, 2 are special from the viewpoint of\nthe algebra (6.3). Although the algebraic content of it remains the same, the algebra is not\n14\n\n\fgenerated by the operators Z and Z\u0304, i. e. it is not intrinsic any more. In these cases the\ngenerating elements produce the sl(2, R) or su(2) only.\nThe operators D, D\u0304 and G can be treated as dependent covariant coordinates of a noncommutative membrane. Indeed, the equivalent set of coordinates\nD + D\u0304\n,\nX1 = p\n8|c1 |\n\nobeys the condition\n\nD \u2212 D\u0304\nX2 = i p\n,\n8|c1|\n\nX12 + X22 \u2212 \u03b5X32 = \u03b5\u03b82 \u03b1 (1 \u2212 \u03b1) = \u2212\u03b5r 2 ,\n\nX3 = G\n\n(6.7)\n\nwhere \u03b5 = sign c1 and \u03b1 = (c1 + c0 )/(2c1 ) (c1 > 0) or \u03b1 = \u2212p/2 (c1 < 0), p \u2208 Z+ . So,\nthe operators Xi form the set of noncommutative covariant coordinates of the fuzzy sphere\nS\u03b82 (c1 < 0), or of the noncommutative hyperbolic plane H\u03b82 (c1 > 0). The operators Z,\nZ\u0304 and S, in their turn, can be interpreted as the covariant derivatives. Note that in the\nnoncommutative system under consideration, unlike the constant magnetic field case [22],\nthe covariant coordinates are not proportional to the covariant derivatives.\nThe intrinsic algebra gives us the possibility to define the magnetic field in a covariant\nway. In general, if the derivatives form a Lie algebra, [\u2202i , \u2202j ] = fij k \u2202k , then the corresponding\ngauge covariant field strength can be defined as iFij = [Di , Dj ] \u2212 fij k Dk (e. g., see Ref. [22]),\nwhere Di are gauge covariant derivatives. From this definition and the intrinsic algebra it\nfollows that in the present case only the \"transversal\" component (i = 3) of the magnetic\nfield, Bi = 21 fi jk Fjk , does not vanish. In the gauge (4.8) this component exactly coincides\nwith the definition (4.13). It is interesting to note that like in the commutative case [11],\nthe magnetic field is a linear function of the \"transversal\" coordinate.\nIn terms of the generators of the algebra (6.3) the higher operators of the contracted\nOnsager algebra are\n\u0001\nZm = (2c1 )m Z + \u03b8\u22121 (1 \u2212 \u03b8f )(1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03b8f )2m )D ,\n\u0001\nBm = (2c1 )m S + \u03b8\u22121 (1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03b8f )2m )G ,\n\nwhere \u03b8f 6= 0, 1, 2. Applying this form of the generators of the Onsager algebra to the infinite\nset of the commuting charges (6.2), one can obtain\nJk\u03bb =\n\n\u0011\n\u0001\n\u0001\n(2c1 )k\u22121 \u0010\n2 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03b8f )2k H\u03bb \u2212 c1 (1 \u2212 \u03b8f )2 \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03b8f )2k S(S \u2212 \u03bb) + . . . ,\n\u03b8f (2 \u2212 \u03b8f )\n\nwhere dots denote a linear combination of the Casimir operators (6.5). This representation\nleads to the conclusion that the Hamiltonian (2.4) and the operator S form a complete set\nof nontrivial integrals of the system under consideration.\n\n6.2\n\nThe commutative limit\n\nOur aim is to apply the found intrinsic algebra of the noncommutative system with the\nHamiltonian ( 2.4) for investigation of its spectrum. The algebraic scheme we shall discuss is\nan analogue of the Fock space construction. It is based on the introduction of the \"ground\"\n15\n\n\fvectors in the Hilbert space of the system (2.4). These vectors have special properties with\nrespect to the action of the generators of the intrinsic algebra.\nFirst of all, let us note that in the commutative limit \u03b8 \u2192 0 the algebra (6.3) is converted\ninto the intrinsic algebra of the system (2.4) living on the (pseudo)sphere [11]. Indeed, with\nthe rescaling\nG\u2192\n\nG\n,\n4c1 f\n\nD\u2192\n\nD\n,\n2f\n\nD\u0304 \u2192\n\nD\u0304\n,\n2f\n\nc1 \u2192 2\u03b2,\n\nwhere the parameter \u03b2 is related to the radius of the (pseudo)sphere, the algebra (6.3)\nchanges into the intrinsic algebra appeared in Ref. [11] in the limit \u03b8 \u2192 0.\nSince the commutative case is much simpler than the noncommutative one, we shall start\nthe discussion of the covariant algebraic construction from it.\nWe introduce a vector (\"ground\" state) of the Hilbert space which obeys the conditions\nZ\u03a8(0) = D\u03b1(G)\u03a8(0) ,\n\nZ\u0304\u03a8(0) = D\u0304\u03b2(G)\u03a8(0) ,\n\nS\u03a8(0) = s\u03a8(0) .\n\n(6.8)\n\nHere \u03b1(.) and \u03b2(.) are some functions, which will be defined later, and s \u2208 R. We start\nwith the real eigenvalues of the operator S since no quantization condition follows from the\nintrinsic algebra. Besides, we know [11] that the eigenvalues do are real in general, since the\nmagnetic flux gives a contribution to them and for a noncompact surface it is not quantized.\nFrom the commutation relations for the generating elements Z and Z\u0304 the following constraint on the functions \u03b1(G) and \u03b2(G) appears:\n\u0012\n\u0013\nc21\n1\n2\nG \u2212\n\u033a\u2032(G) + G\u033a(G) = G \u2212 4\u03b2 2 s,\n(6.9)\n2\n4\nwhere \u033a(G) = \u03b1(G) + \u03b2(G). The solution of the differential equation is\n\u033a(G) = 1 \u2212\n\n8\u03b2 2 s\n4\u03b2 2 c1 m\n\u2212\n.\nc2\nG + c21\nG2 \u2212 41\n\n(6.10)\n\nThe parameter m is the integration constant. One should regard this constant as an integer\nsince it corresponds to the quantum number of the planar angular momentum of the system\n[11].\nWe will look for the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian in the form\n\u03a8 = \u03c3(G)\u03a8(0) ,\n\n(6.11)\n\nwhere we suppose that \u03c3(G) is a polynomial. Then the Hamiltonian (2.4) is reduced to the\nsecond order differential operator\n\u0012\n\u0013 2\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\u0012\n\u0001\nc21\nd\nc21\nd\n2\n\u2032\n2\n2\n2\nH\u03bb = \u2212 4\u03b2 G \u2212\n\u03b1(G) \u2212 \u03b2(G) \u2212 8\u03b2 G\n+\nG \u2212\n2\n4 dG\n4\ndG\n(6.12)\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2\n\u03b1(G)\u03b2(G)\nc\n1\n\u03b1\u2032(G) +\n+ const\n+ G(2f + \u03bb \u2212 1) + G2 \u2212\n4\n4\u03b2 2\n16\n\n\facting on the function \u03c3(G).\nLet us fix the residuary arbitrariness in the definition of the functions \u03b1(G) and \u03b2(G) requiring that the operator (6.12) is quasi-exactly solvable. Therefore, it should be represented\nin terms of the generators of the sl(2, R) algebra [12]\nJ+ = G2\n\nd\n\u2212 (N \u2212 1)G,\ndG\n\nJ0 = G\n\nd\nN\u22121\n\u2212\n,\ndG\n2\n\nJ\u2212 =\n\nd\n,\ndG\n\n(6.13)\n\nwhere if the real parameter N is a nonnegative integer, it defines dimensionality of the\ncorresponding finite-dimensional representation. Moreover, the operator (6.12) is a quadratic\npolynomial in the generators (6.13) since it is a second order differential operator [12].\nEventually one can conclude that the operator (6.12) can be represented in the form\nT = c21 \u03b2 2 J\u22122 \u2212 4\u03b2 2 J02 + a+ J+ + a0 J0 + a\u2212 J\u2212 + const,\n\n(6.14)\n\nwhere the parameters a\u00b1 , a0 and N have the following eight solutions:\nN = \u01eb\u03bb,\n\na+ = \u01eb,\n\na0 = 4\u01eb\u03b2 2 (2s \u2212 \u03bb) ,\n\nN = \u01eb(\u03bb \u2212 m),\n\na+ = \u01eb,\n\na0 = 4\u01eb\u03b2 2 (2s \u2212 m \u2212 \u03bb),\n\nN = \u01eb(\u03bb \u2212 2s),\n\na+ = \u01eb,\n\na0 = \u22124\u01eb\u03bb\u03b2 2 ,\n\nN = \u01eb(\u03bb + m \u2212 2s),\n\na+ = \u01eb,\n\na0 = 4\u01eb(m \u2212 \u03bb)\u03b2 2 ,\n\n\u0001\n\u01eb\na\u2212 = c1 c1 + 16\u03b2 2 (m \u2212 s) ,\n4\n\u01eb\na\u2212 = c1 (c1 \u2212 16\u03b2 2s),\n4\n\u01eb\na\u2212 = c1 (c1 \u2212 16\u03b2 2(m \u2212 s)),\n4\n\u01eb\na\u2212 = c1 (c1 + 16\u03b2 2 s),\n(6.15)\n4\n\nwhere \u01eb = \u00b11. So, if the parameters of the system take such values that N \u2208 Z+ for any of\nthe solutions, then the system is quasi-exactly solvable. Any QES part of the spectrum is\na superstructure over the corresponding \"ground\" state. Therefore, one can interpret these\nstates as some QES \"vacua\" of the system. Here and in what follows we will understand\nunder the QES \"vacuum\" a state over which one can construct a certain number of states\nof the QES part of the spectrum following an oscillator-like procedure based on an intrinsic\nalgebra.\nThe number of the sl(2, R) representations (6.14) coincides with the number of the solutions found in Ref. [11]. At the same time, it is worth noting that the method based on the\nintrinsic algebra is completely covariant since all the generators of the algebra are covariant\nquantities.\nWe would like also to remind that this commutative system possesses a discrete symmetry\nZ2 \u2297 Z2 \u2297 Z2 , which intertwines the solutions (6.15) between themselves. The detailed\ndiscussion of the symmetry can be found in Ref. [11].\n\n6.3\n\nThe noncommutative case\n\nTo investigate the spectral problem for the noncommutative system with the Hamiltonian\n(2.4) in terms of the intrinsic algebra (6.3), we introduce a \"ground\" state obeying the\nconditions (6.8) but with the only change\nS\u03a8(0) = m\u03a8(0) ,\n\nm \u2208 Z.\n17\n\n(6.16)\n\n\fOne can treat this number as an \"azimuthal\" quantum number since it corresponds to\nthe existence of \"axial\" symmetry in the system with operator S as its generator. We\nassume this in accordance with the representation (5.1) of the eigenstates. Therefore, in the\nnoncommutative case the conserved quantity S is an analogue of the angular momentum\noperator. We would like to note that although we use formally the same conditions (6.8),\none should remember that the operators D, D\u0304 and G do not commute and the ordering of\nthe operators is important.\nFrom the commutation relations of the generating elements (6.3) and the definition of\nthe \"ground\" state (6.8) it follows that the functions \u03b1(G) and \u03b2(G) are not independent\nbut obey the constraint\n\u0001\n2c1 G (1 \u2212 \u03b8f ) (\u03b1(G) + \u03b2(G)) + \u03b8\u03b1(G)\u03b2(G) + D\u0304D (1 \u2212 \u03b8f + \u03b8\u03b1(G)) \u2206+ \u03b2(G)\n\u0001\n+ D D\u0304 1 \u2212 \u03b8f + \u03b8\u03b2(G) \u2206\u2212 \u03b1(G) = 2c1 (m + f (2 \u2212 \u03b8f ) G) .\n\n(6.17)\n\nThis is the noncommutative analogue of the restriction (6.9).\nFor investigation of the spectral problem it is convenient to represent the Hamiltonian as\nthe linear in Z, Z\u0304 form:\n\u0001\nH\u03bb = \u2212 2\u03b8\u22121 (1 \u2212 \u03b8f ) D Z\u0304 + D\u0304Z + 2c1 \u03b8\u22121 f (2 \u2212 \u03b8f ) G (G \u2212 \u03bb\u03b8)\n(6.18)\n+ 4c1 \u03b8\u22121 GS + 2c1 S (S \u2212 \u03bb) \u2212 \u03b8\u22122 C1 (1 \u2212 \u03b8f )2 + \u03b8\u22122 C2 .\nUsing the definition of the \"ground\" state (6.8), the spectral problem for the Hamiltonian\nin this form is reduced to that of the finite-difference operator\n\u0010\n\u0001\nH\u03bb = 2 (\u03b8f \u2212 1) D D\u0304 1 \u2212 \u03b8f + \u03b8\u03b2(G) \u2206+ \u2206\u2212 + D\u0304D\u03b1(G) \u2212 D D\u0304\u03b2(G)\n\u0001\n\u0001\u0011\n+ 2c1 (1 \u2212 \u03b8f ) G \u2206+ + \u03b8\u22121 D\u0304D\u03b1(G) + D D\u0304\u03b2(G)\n+ 2c1 f \u03b8\u22121 (2 \u2212 \u03b8f ) G (G \u2212 \u03bb\u03b8) + 4c1 m\u03b8\u22121 G + const\n\n(6.19)\n\nacting on the function \u03c3(G). Here the operators \u2206\u00b1 are defined as the difference derivatives\n(3.3) but with N changed for G. The operator (6.19) is a finite-difference operator in the\nvariable G since D\u0304D and D D\u0304 are the quadratic polynomials in G,\n\u0012\n\u00132\n\u0012\n\u00132\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\n\u03b8 2 c0\n\u03b8 2 c0\nD\u0304D = c1 G +\n,\nD D\u0304 = c1 G \u2212\n,\n+\n+\n2\n4c1\n2\n4c1\nas this follows from the intrinsic algebra (6.3) and the form of the Casimir operators (6.5),\n(6.6). The evident advantage of the representation (6.18) is that the finite-difference operator\n(6.19) is linear in the functions \u03b1(G) and \u03b2(G).\nRepresenting the functions \u03b1(G) and \u03b2(G) in the form\n\u03b1(G) =\n\n\u03b1\u0303(G)\n,\nD\u0304D\n\n\u03b2(G) =\n\n\u03b2\u0303(G)\n,\nD D\u0304\n\none can see that if the functions \u03b1\u0303(G) and \u03b2\u0303(G) are polynomials, then the operator (6.19)\nis a finite-difference operator with polynomial coefficient functions and vice versa.\n18\n\n\fLet us fix the form of the functions \u03b1\u0303(G) and \u03b2\u0303(G) by demanding the Hamiltonian (6.18)\nto be a QES operator of the form (A.10) for some values of the parameters. Moreover, we\nrequire that the functions to obey the constraint (6.18). In comparison with the commutative case the noncommutative one is drastically different. There are four solutions for the\nfunctions \u03b1\u0303(G) and \u03b2\u0303(G) providing the quasi exact solvability of the Hamiltonian (6.18).\nThe explicit form of the function is not important. The corresponding solutions for the\ncoefficients in the representation (A.10) are\n\u0001\u0001\n2c1\n1\u2213\u03bc\na1,2 = 0,\nb\u00b1\n(1 \u2212 \u03b8f )1\u00b1\u03bc ,\nb\u00b1\n,\n+ = \u2213\n0 = 2c1 2j + \u03bc (1 \u00b1 1)m \u2212 \u03bb (1 \u2212 \u03b8f )\n\u03b8\n\u0001\n\u0001 \u0011\n\u03b8(c1 \u2212 \u01ebc0 ) \u0010\n\u01ebc\n\u2212\n4j\n+\n2\u03bc\n(1\n\u00b1\n\u03bc)m\n\u2212\n\u03bb\n+\n1\nc1 (1 \u2212 \u03b8f )1\u2213\u03bc ,\n(6.20)\nb\u00b1\n=\n\u00b1\n0\n\u2212\n2c1\n\nwhere \u01eb = \u00b11 and \u03bc = \u00b11 parametrize the set of solutions. The main difference of these\nsolutions from those of the commutative case (6.15) is the absence of restrictions on the\nparameter N = 2j + 1. Therefore, the operator (6.19) is quasi-exactly solvable since we can\nalways choose the parameter N to be natural.\nThe functions \u03b1\u0303(G) and \u03b2\u0303(G) corresponding to the solution (6.20) depend on the parameter j. Therefore, one can consider that it labels the \"ground\" states as well,\n(0)\n\n\u03a8(0) = \u03a8m,j .\nHere we recovered the dependence of the state on the quantum number m (6.16). Hence,\nunlike the commutative case, the noncommutative system admits the infinite number of\nthe \"ground\" states for every value of the quantum number m. These states serve as QES\n\"vacua\" of the model.\nLike the commutative case, the noncommutative system has a discrete symmetry. Indeed,\nevidently that the substitution\nc0 \u2192 \u2212c0\n(6.21)\nconverts the solutions (6.20) with \u01eb = 1 to those with \u01eb = \u22121 and vice versa. This transformation is similar to the transformations of the commutative case since it converts one QES\noperator (6.19) into another of the same type. Besides, in this case there is another discrete\ntransformation\n\u03b8 \u2192 \u2212\u03b8,\n\nf \u2192 \u2212f,\n\n\u03bb \u2192 \u2212\u03bb,\n\nm \u2192 \u2212m.\n\n(6.22)\n\nThis mapping induces the following change of the parameters (6.20) and the operators (A.5):\n\u2213\nb\u00b1\n\u03b1 (\u03bc) \u2192 b\u03b1 (\u2212\u03bc),\n\nJ\u03b1\u00b1 \u2192 J\u03b1\u2213 ,\n\nwhere \u03b1 = 0, \u00b1. The transformation of the generators is provoked by the change of the\nsign of the parameter \u03b8. This follows from the definitions of the forward and backward\nderivatives (3.3) and of the generators (A.5) themselves. In this way, the transformation\n(6.22) intertwines the QES operators corresponding to the solutions (6.20) with \u03bc = 1 and\n\u03bc = \u22121, respectively. The whole group of the discrete symmetry consists of four elements\nincluding the identity mapping. The transformations (6.21) and (6.22) are associated with\nthe generators of a finite generated Abelian group [23]. This discrete group is Z2 \u2297 Z2 since\nall its elements are involutive. So, like in the commutative case, this discrete symmetry is a\nkind of duality.\n19\n\n\f7\n\nDiscussion and outlook\n\nLet us summarize briefly the obtained results and discuss some open problems that deserve\nfurther attention.\nThe Dolan-Grady relations provide a rich algebraic structure, which arises in numerous\nbranches of mathematical physics. These relations originally appeared in the framework\nof various integrable models [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Later it was observed that the Dolan-Grady\nrelations are necessary conditions of the anomaly-free quantization [8, 9] of a pseudo-classical\n1D systems with the nonlinear holomorphic supersymmetry [7]. This observation revealed\nthe intimate connection of the relations with the QES systems. The algebraic origin of the\nconstruction allowed us to apply it to the two-dimensional systems [10, 11]. In the present\npaper we demonstrated that\n\u2022 The Dolan-Grady relations arise in low-dimensional matrix models.\nThe matrix models naturally lead to appearance of the noncommutative geometry [13, 14, 24].\nUsing this observation as a hint, we applied the algebraic scheme described in Ref. [9] to\nthe two-dimensional systems on a noncommutative background subjected to an external\nU(1) gauge interaction. We started by postulating that the coordinates form the generalized\ndeformed oscillator algebra [18]. The Hamiltonian of the system was constructed in terms of\ngenerating elements realized as gauge covariant derivatives on the noncommutative manifold.\nWe showed that the generating elements obey the Dolan-Grady relations only when\n\u2022 The noncommutative coordinates generate su(2), sl(2, R) or the Heisenberg algebras.\nThis allowed us to identify the resulting noncommutative manifold, correspondingly, with\nthe fuzzy sphere S\u03b82 , the noncommutative hyperbolic plane H\u03b82 or the noncommutative plane\nR2\u03b8 . The cases of su(2) and sl(2, R) were discussed in detail.\nWe showed that the parameter f defining the intensity of the quasi-magnetic field has\nthe three critical values: f = 0, f = \u03b8\u22121 and f = 2\u03b8\u22121 . The first case is trivial since it\ncorresponds to the absence of the gauge interaction (B = 0). The second case is analogous\nto the situation for the particle on the fuzzy sphere and the noncommutative hyperbolic\nplane in the presence of the constant magnetic field B = \u03b8\u22121 [22] (see also Ref. [21] for the\ncase of the noncommutative plane). For this special value the systems are degenerate. In\nthe third case, f = 2\u03b8\u22121 , the quasi-magnetic field vanishes while the gauge interaction still\nis present in the model since the corresponding connection is not trivial, f 6= 0 (see Eqs.\n(4.8), (4.12)). This resembles the famous Aharonov-Bohm effect, but here its origin roots in\nthe noncommutativity of the configuration space. Note that there is no analogue of such a\nphenomenon in the constant magnetic field case.\nBy the reduction of the Hamiltonian to one-dimensional finite-difference operators, it was\nshowed that the constructed noncommutative systems are quasi-exactly solvable for some\nvalues of the coupling constant. In the commutative limit the systems on the fuzzy sphere\nand noncommutative hyperbolic plane lead to QES systems on the corresponding Riemann\nsurfaces [11].\nThe algebraic content of the given model was revealed by the construction of the intrinsic\nalgebra. Using the notion of the intrinsic algebra, in Ref. [11] we proposed a general algebraic\n20\n\n\fmethod of constructing the covariant form of the integrals of motion. Developing this idea,\nhere we demonstrated how\n\u2022 The spectral problem can be treated in terms of the intrinsic algebra.\nThe advantage of this approach is its complete covariance. For example, one does not need\nto impose any gauge conditions since the intrinsic algebra operates with covariant quantities.\nThe application of this method allowed us to show that the noncommutative systems under\nconsideration are quasi-exactly solvable for any value of the coupling constant.\nIn the noncommutative case the reduction of the Hamiltonian and the application of intrinsic algebra to the spectral problem lead to some finite-difference equations. To investigate\ntheir quasi exact solvability,\n\u2022 A deformation of the sl(2, R) scheme for finite-difference QES systems was proposed.\nIn this approach the sl(2, R) algebra is changed for its nonlinear analogue (A.6). We showed\nthat the deformed scheme is not equivalent to the approach based on the usual sl(2, R)\nalgebra [25] if one requires for finite-difference QES operators to be the polynomials in the\ngenerators of the corresponding algebras.\nSurprisingly enough, but the system (2.4) in a non-constant magnetic field on the noncommutative plane (the coordinates form the Heisenberg algebra) is more complicated than\nthe systems on the fuzzy sphere and the noncommutative hyperbolic plane investigated in\nthis paper. Therefore, it is of interest to investigate this system and verify if it inherits such\na property as the quasi exact solvability. Furthermore, it would be interesting to apply the\nobserved analogy between the matrix equations and the parafermionic trilinear commutation\nrelations [16] to construct new solutions. Such a consideration will be presented elsewhere\n[26].\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank W. Orrick and J. Perk for useful comments. M.P. is also grateful to A.

[25] Smirnov and Turbiner proposed the approach to finite-difference QES equations based on the following representation of the Heisenberg algebra:\na = \u2206+ ,\n\nb = x(1 \u2212 \u03b8\u2206\u2212 ),\n\n(A.1)\n\nwhere x is a real variable and \u2206\u00b1 are the forward and backward difference operators (3.3)\nwith respect to this variable. These operators obey the standard commutation relation,\n[a, b] = 1.\n21\n\n\fLike in the standard approach to 1D differential QES equations, an operator for the\ncorresponding spectral problem is supposed to be a polynomial in the sl(2, R) generators\nN\u22121\n,\nJ\u2212 = a.\n(A.2)\n2\nWhen N \u2208 N, the space of polynomials PN\u22121 (x) is invariant with respect to the action of\nthese operators. Hence, any polynomial in the generators (A.2) is an invariant operator on\nthis space as well, i. e. it is a QES operator.\nWe are interested in the spectral problem for a three-point finite-difference equation,\nJ+ = b2 a \u2212 (N \u2212 1)b,\n\nJ0 = ba \u2212\n\nA(x)\u03a8(x + \u03b8) + B(x)\u03a8(x) + C(x)\u03a8(x \u2212 \u03b8) = E\u03a8(x).\n\n(A.3)\n\nRef. [25] claims that all such QES equations with finite number of polynomial eigenfunctions\nare classified via the cubic polynomial element of the universal enveloping algebra of sl(2, R)\ntaken in the representation (A.1):\n\u0001\nT = A+ J+ + \u03b8J02 + A1 J02 (\u03b8J\u2212 + 1) + A2 J0 J\u2212 + A3 J0 + A4 J\u2212 + const,\n(A.4)\n\nwhere the coefficients are arbitrary real parameters. Below we shall show that this operator\nis not the most general among QES operators corresponding to the three-point problem\n(A.3).\nLet us introduce the finite-difference operators which are linear in the finite-difference\nderivatives,\nJ+\u00b1 = x2 \u2206\u00b1 \u2212 2jx,\n\nJ0\u00b1 = x\u2206\u2213 \u2212 j,\n\nJ\u2212\u00b1 = \u2206\u2213 .\n\n(A.5)\n\nThe half-integer parameter j (2j \u2208 Z+ ) is an analogue of \"spin\" in the usual sl(2, R) scheme\n[12]. These linearly independent operators are finite-difference analogues of the sl(2, R)\ngenerators, which can be reproduced in the commutative limit, \u03b8 \u2192 0. The operators (A.5)\nhave another useful property of the sl(2, R) generators. They have the invariant finitedimensional subspace, which is the space of polynomials P2j (x), 2j \u2208 Z+ , dim P2j (x) =\n2j + 1 = N. This allows us to use the generators (A.5) for the construction of finitedifference QES operators in the manner analogous to the continuous case. The exhaustive\ninvestigation of this construction lies out of the scope of the paper and here we will discuss\njust some aspects of it.\nThe both sets J\u03bc+ and J\u03bc\u2212 , \u03bc = 0, \u00b1, form the nonlinear subalgebras of the form\n\u0002 \u00b1 \u00b1\u0003\nJ , J = 2J0\u00b1 \u00b1 \u03b8(2j \u2212 1)J\u2212\u00b1 ,\n\u0002 \u2212\u00b1 +\u00b1 \u0003\n\u0001\nJ0 , J+ = J+\u00b1 \u2213 \u03b8 2J+\u00b1 J\u2212\u00b1 + (2j + 1)(J0\u00b1 + j) ,\n(A.6)\n\u0002 \u00b1 \u00b1\u0003\n\u00b1\nJ\u2212 , J0 = J\u2212 T\u2213 ,\nwhere the operators\n\nT\u00b1 = 1 \u00b1 \u03b8J\u2212\u2213\n\n(A.7)\n\nare the discrete forward and backward translation generators, T\u00b1 \u03c8(x) = \u03c8(x \u00b1 \u03b8). The\nintertwining commutation relations between the sets J\u03bc+ and J\u03bc\u2212 are\n\u0002 \u2213 \u00b1\u0003\n\u0001\n\u0002 + \u2212\u0003\n\u0001\nJ\u2212 , J+ = 2J0\u2213 \u00b1 \u03b8J\u2212\u2213 T\u00b1 ,\nJ+ , J+ = \u03b8 2J++ J0+ \u2212 J++ + (2j + 1)J+\u2212 ,\n\u0002 \u2213 \u00b1\u0003\n\u0001\n\u0002 + \u2212\u0003\nJ0 , J+ = J+\u00b1 \u00b1 \u03b8(J0\u2213 + j) T\u00b1 ,\nJ0 , J0 = J0+ \u2212 J0\u2212 ,\n\u0002 \u2213 \u00b1\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0003\nJ\u2212 , J0 = J\u2212\u2213 ,\nJ\u2212+ , J\u2212\u2212 = 0.\n(A.8)\n22\n\n\fIt is obvious that in the commutative limit, \u03b8 \u2192 0, the nonlinear commutation relations\n(A.6), (A.8) tend to the usual sl(2, R) algebra. Furthermore, for the realization (A.5) of the\nnonlinear algebra the following quadratic identities hold:\n\u0001\nJ0\u00b1 J0\u00b1 \u2212 J+\u2213 J\u2212\u00b1 \u2212 J0\u00b1 \u00b1 \u03b8 J0\u00b1 + j J\u2212\u00b1 \u2212 j(j + 1) = 0,\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u03b8 J0+ + j J0\u2212 + j \u2212 1 + J+\u2212 \u2212 J++ = 0,\n\u0001\nJ++ J0+ \u2212 J+\u2212 J0\u2212 \u2212 (j + 1) J++ \u2212 J+\u2212 = 0,\n\u0001\nJ+\u2212 T+ \u2212 J++ + 2j \u03b8 J0\u2212 + j = 0,\n(A.9)\n\u0001\nJ0\u2212 + j T\u2212 \u2212 J0+ \u2212 j = 0,\nJ\u2212\u2212 T\u2212 \u2212 J\u2212+ = 0.\nTaking into account these identities and the commutation relations (A.6), (A.8), the most\ngeneral three-point operator (A.3), quadratic in the generators (A.5), can be written as\n+\n+ +\n+ +\nHQES = a1 J++ J+\u2212 + a2 J+\u2212 J0\u2212 + b+\n+ J+ + b0 J0 + b\u2212 J\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212 \u2212\n\u2212 \u2212\n+ b\u2212\n+ J+ + b0 J0 + b\u2212 J\u2212 + const.\n\n(A.10)\n\nBy the construction this operator is quasi-exactly solvable.\nThe generators of the sl(2, R) algebra in the representation (A.2) can be represented as\npolynomials in the operators (A.5),\n\u0001\nJ+ = J+\u2212 \u2212 \u03b8(J0+ + j) T\u2212 ,\nJ0 = J0+ ,\nJ\u2212 = J\u2212\u2212 .\n(A.11)\nHence, the QES scheme based on the sl(2, R) generators (A.2) is included into that based\non the operators (A.5). On the other hand, the operators (A.5) can also be represented in\nterms of (A.2) via the two last equalities in (A.11) and\n\u0001\nJ++ = J+ + \u03b8 (J0 + j) \u03b8 (J0 + j) J\u2212 + 2J0 \u2212 1 ,\nJ\u2212+ = J\u2212 (1 + \u03b8J\u2212 )\u22121 ,\n(A.12)\nJ+\u2212 = J+ T+ + \u03b8(J0 + j),\nJ0\u2212 = J0 + \u03b8 (J0 + j) J\u2212 .\n\nAccording to these relations the shift operator T+ (A.7) is linear in the generator J\u2212 . As\nwe see, the correspondence is not of a polynomial form for the operator J\u2212+ . Therefore, the\nsl(2, R) scheme (A.2) is not equivalent to that based on the operators (A.5) if one restricts\nQES operators to a polynomial in the generators of the (A.2) and (A.5) forms. One can\nalso notice that the 5-parametric (up to overall shift) QES operator (A.4) is not the most\ngeneral QES operator in the framework of sl(2, R) scheme. Indeed, for the case b3 = 0 the\nQES operator (A.10) can be represented as a 5-th degree polynomial in the generators (A.2)\nwith 7 arbitrary real parameters.\nIn addition, we note that if one imposes the following restrictions on the parameters of\nthe QES operator (A.10)\na1 = 0,\n\na2 = 0,\n\nthen it becomes exactly solvable.\n\n23\n\n+\nb\u2212\n+ = \u2212b+ ,\n\n(A.13)\n\n\fReferences\n[1] L.
