nonergodicity\n\narXiv:cond-mat/0405637v2 [cond-mat.stat-mech] 28 May 2004\n\nEric Lutz\nDepartment of Quantum Physics, University of Ulm, D-89069 Ulm, Germany\nSloane Physics Laboratory, Yale University, P.O. Box 208120, New Haven, CT 06520-8120\n(Dated: September 20, 2018)\nWe establish an explicit correspondence between ergodicity breaking in a system described by\npower\u2013law tail distributions and the divergence of the moments of these distributions.\nPACS numbers: 05.40.Fb,05.40-a\n\nStatistical mechanics is a combination of the law of\nlarge numbers and the laws of mechanics. Since its foundation in the late 19th century, this theory has been extremely successful in describing equilibrium and nonequilibrium properties of a very large number of macroscopic\nsystems [1]. In the last decade, however, a new class\nof systems that do not obey the law of large numbers\nhas emerged [2, 3, 4]. The behavior of these systems is\ndominated by large and rare fluctuations that are characterized by broad distributions with power\u2013law tails. The\nhallmark of these statistical distributions, commonly referred to as L\u00e9vy statistics [5], is the divergence of their\nfirst and/or second moment.\nThe question we address in this paper is how ergodicity\nis affected in systems described by power\u2013law tail distributions with diverging moments. Ergodicity is a central concept in statistical physics and is usually stated\nby saying that ensemble average and time average of\nobservables are equal in the infinite\u2013time limit [6, 7].\nThe ergodic hypothesis has recently been investigated experimentally in two different systems governed by L\u00e9vy\nstatistics in time: fluorescence intermittency of nanocrystal quantum dots [8] and subrecoil laser cooling of atoms\n[9]. Both experiments have found that L\u00e9vy statistics\ninduces ergodicity breaking. A precise understanding\nof the connection between divergent moments and nonergodicity is thus of high interest. A common feature\nof the systems in the above experiments is their non\u2013\nstationarity. This in in contrast to the system we propose\nto study, namely atomic transport in an optical lattice,\nwhere a steady state does exist. Nonetheless, we will\nshow that this system can exhibit nonergodic behavior.\nAn optical lattice is a standing wave light field formed\nat the intersection of two or more laser beams [10]. Due\nto the spatial periodicity of the potential, an optical lattice is similar in many respects to a solid state crystal.\nThe main advantage of an optical lattice, however, is its\nhigh tunability: both the period and the amplitude of\nthe optical potential can be modified in a controlled way.\nThis has the interesting consequence that the exponents\nof the power\u2013law distributions appearing in this system\nare not fixed, as in most systems, but can be varied continuously, allowing the exploration of different regimes.\nThe motion of atoms in a one-dimensional optical lattice formed by two counterpropagating laser beams with\nlinear perpendicular polarization can be described, after\nspatial averaging, by a Fokker\u2013Planck equation for the\n\nsemiclassical Wigner function W (p, t) [11, 12, 13],\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u2202W\n\u2202W\n\u2202\n\u2202\nD(p)\n.\n= \u2212 [K(p)W ] +\n\u2202t\n\u2202p\n\u2202p\n\u2202p\n\n(1)\n\nThe momentum\u2013dependent drift and diffusion coefficients are respectively given by,\nK(p) = \u2212\n\n\u03b1p\n,\n1 + (p/pc )2\n\nD(p) = D0 +\n\nD1\n. (2)\n1 + (p/pc )2\n\nThe drift K(p) corresponds to a cooling force with friction coefficient \u03b1, while the diffusion coefficient D(p) represents stochastic momentum fluctuations and describes\nheating processes. It is worth noticing that for large momentum, the range of the drift is limited by the capture\nmomentum pc , while the range of the fluctuations is not.\nThe kinetic equation (1) is valid in a regime where (i)\nthe atomic momentum is large, p \u226b h\u0304k, where k is the\nwave number of the laser field (this defines the semiclassical limit), (ii) the saturation parameter is small, s \u226a 1\n(this corresponds to low laser intensity) and (iii) the kinetic energy of the atoms is large, p2 /2m \u226b U0 , where\nU0 is the depth of the optical potential (this last condition allows spatial averaging). The stationary solution of\nthe atomic transport equation (1) which satisfies natural\nboundary conditions, Ws (p \u2192 \u00b1\u221e) \u2192 0, is of the form,\n2\n1h\nD0\np2 i\u2212(\u03b1pc )/(2D0 )\nWs (p) =\n1+\n,\n(3)\nZ\nD0 + D1 p2c\nwhere Z is a normalization constant. The momentum distribution (3) has an asymptotic power\u2013law tail,\n2\nWs (p) \u223c |p|\u2212(\u03b1pc )/D0 , with an exponent that can be expressed in terms of the potential depth U0 and the recoil\nenergy ER as (\u03b1p2c )/D0 = U0 /(22ER ) [11]. The statistical properties of the distribution (3) can therefore be\neasily changed from normal statistics for U0 \u2265 66ER , to\nL\u00e9vy statistics for U0 < 66ER , by simply modifying the\ndepth of the optical potential. In particular,\none should\nR\nnote that the second moment, hp2 i = dp p2 Ws (p), becomes infinite when U0 < 66ER . In this regime the mean\nkinetic energy of the system, EK = hp2 i/2m, diverges,\nclearly signaling unusual thermodynamic behavior.\nTransport in an optical lattice has a number of attractive features that make it an ideal case study of the thermodynamical properties of systems described by power\u2013\nlaw distributions. On the one hand, the atomic transport equation (1) has been derived from the microscopic\n\n\f2\nHamiltonian that describes the interaction with the laser\nfields and the quantities that appear in this equation can\nbe expressed in terms of the microscopic parameters of\nthe quantum\u2013optical problem [11]. Moreover, the regime\ndefined by conditions (i) to (iii) has been implemented\nexperimentally and the divergence of the kinetic energy\nbelow a given potential threshold has been observed [14].\nFinally, Eq. (1) is an ordinary linear Fokker\u2013Planck equation, meaning that standard methods of stochastic calculus can be used to analyse the problem. This is in\ncontrast to most systems with power\u2013law distributions\nthat are often described by nonlinear or fractional kinetic equations [15]. In particular, for the case of vanishing D1 (which we shall consider in the sequel [16]),\nEq. (1) corresponds to a random process driven by additive Gaussian white noise. The fact that power\u2013law\nfluctuations with infinite variance occur here in a system subjected solely to additive noise is worth emphasizing. The physical mechanism which gives rise to divergent fluctuations in systems with multiplicative noise,\nwhere the noise strength is proportional to the stochastic variable, is well\u2013known [17]: it is based on a positive\nfeedback loop that leads to the amplification of the noise\nas the value of the random variable increases. On the\nother hand, in the present situation, where the noise intensity is independent of the random variable, a different\npositive feedback mechanism is at work, based on the\nsteady decrease to zero of the friction force as the value\nof the momentum increases. The appearance of infinite\nmomentum fluctuations in this system is thus a striking\nillustration of the complex behavior that can result from\nthe subtle interplay of the noise and the nonlinearity of\nthe drift. In the following, we establish a correspondence\nbetween the divergent moments of the power\u2013law distributions of the system and nonergodic behavior.\nWe begin by transforming the Fokker\u2013Planck equation\n(1) into a Schr\u00f6dinger\u2013like equation by writing W (p, t) =\nWs (p)1/2 \u00d7 \u03c8(p, t) [18]. The function \u03c8(p, t) satisfies the\nimaginary\u2013time Schr\u00f6dinger equation,\n\u2212\n\n\u2202\u03c8\n\u22022\u03c8\n= \u2212D0 2 + V (p)\u03c8 = H\u03c8 ,\n\u2202t\n\u2202p\n\n(4)\n\nwith the potential V (p) = K \u2032 (p)/2 + K(p)2 /(4D0 ). For\nthe drift coefficient (2), this potential reads\n\u03b1p2c p2 (\u03b1p2c + 2D0 ) \u2212 2D0 p2c\nV (p) =\n.\n4D0\n(p2 + p2c )2\n\n(5)\n\nThis transformation reveals the fundamental difference\nbetween the case of finite pc and the case of infinite pc ,\nwhere Eq. (1) reduces to the familiar Ornstein-Uhlenbeck\nprocess with linear drift. For infinite pc , the Schr\u00f6dinger\npotential V (p) asymptotically increases as p2 , whereas for\nfinite pc , it asymptotically decreases as 1/p2 . RBy contrast,\np\nthe Fokker\u2013Planck potential, \u03a6(p) = \u2212 0 dp\u2032 K(p\u2032 ),\nis confining for any value of the capture momentum.\nAs a consequence, the spectrum of the Hamiltonian,\nH\u03c8k (p) = Ek \u03c8k (p), is discrete in the former case, while it\n\nis continuous, except for the discrete ground state \u03c80 (p),\nin the latter. In both cases, the stationary momentum\ndistribution is given by the square of the ground state\neigenfunction, Ws (p) = \u03c80 (p)2 . Interestingly, we note\nthat a real\u2013time Schr\u00f6dinger equation with a potential of\nthe form (5) has recently been considered in Ref. [19]. To\nsimplify the discussion, we now adopt rescaled variables\nfor which \u03b1 = pc = 1 and D0 = D; the noise intensity D\nbeing then the only remaining parameter in the problem.\nIt will also be convenient to divide momentum space into\na low\u2013momentum region |p| < 1, where the drift is approximately linear, K1 (p) \u2243 \u2212p, and a high\u2013momentum\nregion |p| > 1, with a drift K2 (p) \u2243 \u22121/p. The anomalous dynamics of the system is completely determined by\nthe high\u2013momentum region. The eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian H in this region are given by\n\u221a\nEk = Dk 2 and \u03c8k (p) = p [c1 J\u03bd (kp) + c2 Y\u03bd (kp)], where\nJ\u03bd (p) and Y\u03bd (p) are the Bessel functions of the first and\nsecond kind of order \u03bd = (D + 1)/2D. The constants c1,2\nare fixed by the boundary conditions.\nWhen discussing the ergodicity of a system, one is typically not interested in the trajectory in the full space\u2013\nspace, but often in the projection of the trajectory onto\nsome subspace of relevant variables [1], in the present\ncase momentum. A criterion for the equality of ensemble\naverage and time average of a dynamical quantity A is\nthen provided by the condition [20]\n\u0010\n\u00112\n2\n\u03c3A\n(t) = h A \u2212 hA i i \u2212\u2192 0 when t \u2212\u2192 \u221e .\n\n(6)\n\nRt\nHere A = t\u22121 0 d\u03c4 A(p(\u03c4 ))R is the time average of the\nobservable A and hAi = dp A(p)W (p, t) denotes its\nensemble average. In the infinite\u2013time limit, the latter\nR tends to the stationary ensemble average hAis =\ndp A(p)Ws (p). A system that obeys (6) is said to be\nergodic in the mean square sense. In order to determine\nthe ergodicity of our system, we thus need to compute\nthe long\u2013time behavior of the covariance,\nZ\nZ t\nh\n1 t\n2\n(t) = 2\n\u03c3A\ndt1\ndt2 hA(p(t1 ))A(p(t2 ))i \u2212\nt 0\n0\ni\nhA(p(t1 ))i hA(p(t2 ))i . (7)\nThis can be done by applying the usual theory of stochastic processes [18]. The two\u2013time correlation function\nhA(p(t1 ))A(p(t2 ))i is defined by the integral\nhA(p(t1 ))A(p(t2 ))i =\nZZ\ndp1 dp2 A(p1)A(p2 ) W2 (p1 , t1 ; p2 , t2 ) , (8)\nwhere W2 (p1 , t1 ; p2 , t2 ) is the two\u2013point joint probability density function. Since the Fokker\u2013Planck equation\n(1) describes a stationary Markov process (for any value\nof pc ), the probability distribution W2 (p1 , t1 ; p2 , t2 ) depends only on the time difference |t1 \u2212 t2 | and can be\nexpressed in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions\n\n\fof the Schr\u00f6dinger equation (4) in the form,\nW2 (p1 , t1 ; p2 , t2 ) = \u03c80 (p1 )\u03c80 (p2 ) \u00d7\nZ \u221e\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u03c80 (p1 )\u03c80 (p2 ) +\ndk \u03c8k (p1 )\u03c8k (p2 ) e\u2212Ek |t1 \u2212t2 | .(9)\n0\n\nCombining Eqs. (7), (8) and (9) and introducing the variable \u03c4 = t2 \u2212 t1 , we arrive at\nZ\n2 t\n2\n\u03c3A\n(t) = 2\nd\u03c4 (t \u2212 \u03c4 ) CA (\u03c4 ) ,\n(10)\nt 0\nwhere the function CA (\u03c4 ) is given by\nZ \u221e hZ\ni2\ndk\ndp A(p) \u03c80 (p)\u03c8k (p) e\u2212Ek \u03c4 . (11)\nCA (\u03c4 ) =\n0\n\n2\nThe infinite\u2013time limit of the covariance \u03c3A\n(t) is entirely\ndetermined by the asymptotic behavior of CA (\u03c4 ). This\nfunction depends explicitely on the observable A(p). It\nis worthwhile to notice that ergodicity will therefore in\ngeneral depend on the dynamical variable A(p) under\nconsideration. In the following, we take A(p) = pn\nand evaluate the long-time behavior of CA (\u03c4 ) following Ref. [13]. We find CA (\u03c4 ) \u223c \u03c4 \u2212\u03bc with an exponent \u03bc = (1 \u2212 (2n + 1)D)/2D. As a result, the covariance (10) will converge to zero as t \u2192 \u221e, only if\nD < Dn = 1/(2n + 1). We thus obtain the important\nresult that there is a noise threshold Dn above which ergodicity is broken. As already mentioned, this threshold\ndepends explicitely on the parameter n, that is, on the\nquantity A(p): the smaller the power n, the larger the\nvalue of Dn . On the other hand, the moments\nR of the stationary momentum distribution, hpm i = dp pm Ws (p),\n\u2032\nare finite for D < Dm\n= 1/(m+1). We can therefore conclude that there exists a direct relationship between the\nloss of ergodicity in the system for the variable A(p) = pn\nand the divergence of the 2nth moment of the stationary\nmomentum distribution.\nLet us look in more detail at the value n = 0, which\ncorresponds to the largest noise threshold Dn=0 = 1. We\nfirst mention that for D > Dn=0 , the Fokker\u2013Planck equation doesn't have a normalizable stationary solution anymore and the system is obviously nonergodic. Further,\nfor n = 0, the function CA (\u03c4 ) can be rewritten in terms\nof the conditional probability density P2 (p2 , \u03c4 |p1 , 0) as\nZ\nCA (\u03c4 ) =\ndp1 Ws (p1 ) \u00d7\nZ\n\u0010\n\u0011\ndp2 P2 (p2 , \u03c4 |p1 , 0) \u2212 Ws (p2 ) . (12)\n\nThis result is of special interest. Equation (12) shows\nthat, unlike for the Ornstein\u2013Uhlenbeck process, the\nsteady state is here reached in a nonexponential way.\nSuch an asymptotic power\u2013law decay is usually associated with non\u2013Markovian processes and is rather surprising for a stationary Markov process as described by\nEq. (1). The origin of this algebraic behavior is of course\nrooted in the nonlinear drift coefficient (2).\n\nProbability P1,2 (D)\n\n3\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nNoise strength D\n\nFIG. 1: Probability to be in the low\u2013momentum region (continuous line) and in the high\u2013momentum region (dashed line),\nin the long\u2013time limit, as a function of the noise strength D.\n\nA closely related quantity is the first\u2013passage time distribution. The first\u2013passage time is defined as the time\nat which the momentum of the system first exits a certain momentum interval, given that it was originally in\nthat interval. The first\u2013passage time problem for the\nFokker\u2013Planck equation (1) can again be treated using\nstandard techniques of stochastic calculus (see for example Ref. [21]). In the high\u2013momentum region, the\nLaplace transform g2 (s) of the first\u2013passage time distribution obeys the following backward equation,\nD\n\n\u2202 2 g2\n1 \u2202g2\n\u2212\n\u2212 sg2 = 0 .\n\u2202p2\np \u2202p\n\n(13)\n\nSolving Eq. (13) with the boundary conditions g(1) = 1\nand g(\u221e) = 0, we obtain\np\nK\u03bd (p s/D) \u03bd\np\np ,\n(14)\ng2 (s) =\nK\u03bd ( s/D)\n\nwhere K\u03bd (p) is the modified Bessel function of the second kind of order \u03bd. It follows from Eq. (14), that\nto leading order, g2 (s) \u223c s\u03bd as s \u2192 0. The first\u2013\npassage time distribution in region 2 is thus also a power\u2013\nlaw tail distribution and it asymptotically behaves as\ng2 (t) \u223c t\u2212\u03b3 with an exponent \u03b3 =\nR (3D + 1)/(2D). The\ncorresponding moments htn i = dt tn g2 (t) converge if\nD < Dn\u2032\u2032 = 1/(2n \u2212 1). The first\u2013passage time distribution g1 (t) in region 1 can be computed along similar\nlines and the associated moments can be shown to be all\nfinite. Figure (1) shows the probability to be in region\n1 and 2, in the limit of long times, as a function of the\nnoise intensity D. We observe that for small D, atoms\nare mostly located in the low\u2013momentum region, where\nthey experience the linear part of the drift. On the other\nhand, for D close to Dn=0 , atoms get localized in the\nhigh\u2013momentum region, where the drift asymptotically\ndecays as \u22121/p. Remarquably, atoms in this system can\nthus be brought in a high\u2013energy state through the sole\naction of the noise. We note that this problem exhibits\nan interesting analogy with subrecoil laser cooling, where\natoms accumulate in a low\u2013energy state (in a so\u2013called\ndark state), with infinite mean trapping time [22]. To our\nknowledge, loss of ergodicity in systems with divergent\ntrapping times has been first discussed in the context of\nspin\u2013glasses [23].\n\n\f4\nWe can now formulate the main result of the paper:\nEnsemble average and time average of the dynamical\nvariable A(p) = pn stop being equal in the infinite\u2013time\nlimit - ergodicity of the system is accordingly broken-\nwhen the 2nth moment of the stationary momentum distribution and the (n + 1)th moment of the first passage\ntime distribution in the high\u2013momentum region become\ninfinite. An unambiguous correspondence between the\nnonergodic properties of a system described power\u2013law\ndistributions and the divergence of their respective moments is therefore demonstrated. This confirms and extends the findings reported in Refs. [8, 9, 22, 23]. We\nstress that the above result is not restricted to transport\nin an optical lattice and that our analysis applies to a\nwhole class of systems described by an equation of the\nform (1) with a drift coefficient decaying asymptotically\nas \u22121/p. More generally, we conjecture that the result\nalso holds true for other power\u2013law systems, even if they\nare not described by a simple kinetic equation like the\nordinary Fokker\u2013Planck equation (1) [8, 9, 22, 23].\nFurther insight can be gained by considering a discretized form of the Fokker\u2013Planck equation (1). In doing so, we shall obtain a generalization of the Ehrenfest\nurn model, which has played an important role in clarifying the foundations of statistical mechanics [24]. We\nwrite p = j\u2206p and t = l\u2206t and find that the probability\n\u03c9(j, l) = W (j\u2206p, l\u2206t) satisfies the difference equation,\n\u03c9(j, l +1) = a(j \u22121) \u03c9(j \u22121, l)+b(j +1) \u03c9(j +1, l) . (15)\nIn the limit (\u2206p, \u2206t) \u2192 0, Eq. (15) reduces to the contin-\n\n[1] J.R.

At regular time intervals,\n\u2206t, a ball is randomly chosen and moved to the other\nurn; w(j, l) is then the probability of having R + j balls\nin the first urn at time l. In the standard version of the\nmodel, the j 2 terms in Eq. (16) are absent and Eq. (1)\nreduces to the Ornstein\u2013Uhlenbeck process with linear\ndrift. We note that in the continuous description, the\nmomentum p corresponds to the number of excess balls\nj in the first urn. So, for example, ergodicity breaking\nfor n = 1 (D > 1/3) occurs when the fluctuations of the\nnumber of balls in each urn diverge, the average number\nof balls being still finite and equal. Moreover, when D\napproaches one, all the balls preferentially occupy the\nsame urn, therefore acting as Maxwell's demon.\nIn conclusion, we have investigated anomalous transport in an optical lattice from the point of view of statistical mechanics and established an explicit correspondence between ergodicity breaking and the divergence of\nthe moments of the power\u2013law tail distributions describing the behavior of the system, both in momentum space\nand in time.\nWe would like to thank F.
