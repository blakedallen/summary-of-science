For example, the\nsoftening of the EOS at high density, where the pressure rises slower than anticipated, could signal\na transition to an exotic phase. However, extracting the density dependence of the EOS requires\nmeasuring the radii of neutron stars for a broad range of masses. A \"normal\" 1.4M\u2299 (M\u2299 =solar\nmass) neutron star has a central density of a few times nuclear-matter saturation density (\u03c10 ). In\ncontrast, low mass (\u2243 0.5M\u2299 ) neutron stars have central densities near \u03c10 so its radius provides\ninformation on the EOS at low density.

These observations are being complemented\nby studies that aim at constraining the composition of\nthe neutron-star atmosphere [13]. Finally, models of rotational glitches place a lower limit on the radius of the\nVela pulsar at R\u221e >\n\u223c 12 km [14].\nWhile a determination of the mass-radius relation\nR(M ) for a variety of neutron stars would uniquely\ndetermine the equation of state, unfortunately all accurately determined masses to date fall within a very\nsmall range. Indeed, a recent compilation by Thorsett\nand Chakrabarty of several radio binary pulsars place\ntheir masses in the narrow range of 1.25 \u2212 1.44 M\u2299 [7].\nNote that several X-ray binaries appear to have larger\nmasses, perhaps because of accretion. These include\nCyg X-2 with a mass of 1.8 \u00b1 0.2M\u2299 [15], Vela X-1 with\n1.9 M\u2299 [16], and 4U 1700-37 [17]. If confirmed, they\ncould provide additional information on the high density\nEOS. However, these mass determinations are not without controversy [18,19]. On the other hand, it may be\ndifficult to form low mass neutron stars from the collapse\nof heavier Chandrasekhar mass objects. If so, information on the low density EOS may not be directly available\nfrom neutron stars. Thus, it is important to make maximum use of any R(M ) measurements even if these are\navailable for only a limited range of masses.\nAdditional information on the low density EOS may\nbe obtained from precision measurements on atomic nuclei. For example, the neutron radius of a heavy nucleus, such as 208 Pb, is closely related to the pressure\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nThe structure of neutron stars, particularly their\nmasses and radii, depend critically on the equation of\nstate (EOS) of dense matter [1]. New measurements of\nmasses and radii by state-of-the-art observatories should\nplace important constraints on the EOS. Observing a\nrapid change of the EOS with density could signal a transition to an exotic phase of matter. Possibilities for new\nhigh density phases include pion or kaon condensates [2],\nstrange quark matter [3], and/or a color superconductor [4,5]. Measuring neutron-star radii R(M ) for a large\nrange of neutron star masses M is attractive as it would\nallow one to directly deduce the EOS [6], that is, the\npressure as a function of the energy density P (\u01eb).\nWhile the masses of various neutron stars are accurately known [7], precise measurements of their radii do\nnot yet exist. Therefore, several groups are devoting considerable effort at measuring neutron-star radii. Often\none deduces the surface temperature T\u221e and the luminosity L of the star from spectral and distance measurements, respectively. Assuming a black-body spectrum, these measurements determine the surface area,\nand thus the effective radius R\u221e , of the star from the\nStefan-Boltzmann law:\n2\n4\nL = 4\u03c0\u03c3R\u221e\nT\u221e\n.\n\n(1)\n\nOpportunities for precision measurements on neutronstar radii include the isolated neutron star RX J1856353754 [8,9,10] and quiescent neutron stars in globular clusters, such as CXOU 132619.7-472910.8 [11], where distances are accurately known. Moreover, Sanwal and collaborators have recently detected absorption features in\n1\n\n\fof neutron rich matter [20]. Indeed, heavy nuclei develop a neutron-rich skin in response to this pressure.\nThe higher the pressure the further the neutrons are\npushed out against surface tension, thereby generating\na larger neutron radius. However, nuclear properties depend only on the EOS at normal (in the interior) and\nbelow (in the surface) nuclear-matter saturation density\n(\u03c10 \u2248 0.15 nucleons/fm3 ). This is in contrast to conventional 1.4 M\u2299 neutron stars that, with central densities\nof several times \u03c10 , also depend on the high-density component of the EOS. This is not the case for low mass\nneutron stars (of about 1/2 M\u2299 ). Reaching central densities near \u03c10 , low mass neutron stars probe the EOS at\nsimilar densities as atomic nuclei. Therefore, one could\ninfer the radius of low mass neutron stars from detailed\nmeasurements on atomic nuclei. Having inferred the radii\nof low mass neutron stars from a nuclear measurement,\ncombined with the measured radius of a 1.4M\u2299 star, may\nenable one to deduce the density dependence of the EOS.\n(For a recent discussion on the minimum stable mass of a\nneutron star see Ref. [21].) The parity radius experiment\nat Jefferson Laboratory [22] aims to measure accurately\nand model independently the root-mean-square neutron\nradius (Rn ) of 208 Pb via parity violating elastic electron\nscattering [23]. Such an experiment probes neutron densities because the weak vector charge of a neutron is much\nlarger than that of a proton. The goal of the experiment\nis to measure Rn to a 1% accuracy (within \u2248 \u00b10.05 fm).\nThe outline of the paper is as follows. In Sec. II we\npresent a relativistic effective field theory formalism to\nstudy relationships between the neutron radius of 208 Pb\nand the radii of neutron stars. Uncertainties in these relationships are estimated by considering a wide range of\neffective field theory parameters, all of them constrained\nby known nuclear properties. This formalism has been\nused previously to study correlations between the neutron radius of 208 Pb and the properties of the neutronstar crust [24], the radii of 1.4 M\u2299 neutron stars [25],\nand the direct URCA cooling of neutron stars [26]. As\nthe radius of low mass neutron stars depends on the solid\ncrust of nonuniform matter, a treatment of the crust is\ndiscussed in Sec. III. Our results, presented in Sec. IV,\nshow a strong correlation between the radius of a low\nmass neutron star and the neutron radius Rn of 208 Pb\nthat is essentially model independent. This is because\nthe structure of both objects depend on the EOS at similar densities. In contrast, the radius of a 1.4 M\u2299 neutron star shows a considerable model dependence. This\nis because a 1.4 M\u2299 neutron star is also sensitive to the\nEOS at higher densities, and the high density EOS is\nnot constrained by nuclear observables. In Sec. V we\nconclude that properties of low mass neutron stars can\nbe inferred from measuring properties of atomic nuclei.\nIn particular, the radius of a 1/2 M\u2299 neutron star can\nbe deduced from a measurement of Rn in 208 Pb. One\nwill then be able to directly compare this inferred ra-\n\ndius to the measured radius of an \u2248 1.4 M\u2299 neutron\nstar to gain information on the density dependence of\nthe EOS. Thus, even if a mass-radius measurement for a\nsingle (\u2248 1.4 M\u2299 ) neutron star is available, one can use\nthe atomic nucleus to gain information on the density\ndependence of the EOS. This should provide the most\nprecise determination of the density dependence of the\nEOS to date and should indicate whether a transition to\na high density exotic phase of matter is possible or not.\nII. FORMALISM\n\nOur starting point is the relativistic effective-field theory of Ref. [27] supplemented with new couplings between the isoscalar and the isovector mesons. This allows\nus to correlate nuclear observables, such as the neutron\nradius of 208 Pb, with neutron star properties. We will\nexplore uncertainties in these correlations by considering a range of model parameters. The model has been\nintroduced and discussed in detail in several earlier references [24,25,26], yet a brief summary is included here\nfor completeness.\nThe interacting Lagrangian density is given by [24,27]\n\u0011 i\nh\n\u0010\ne\ng\u03c1\nLint = \u03c8\u0304 gs \u03c6\u2212 gv V\u03bc + \u03c4 * b\u03bc + (1+\u03c43 )A\u03bc \u03b3 \u03bc \u03c8\n2\n2\n\u03ba\n\u03bb\n\u03b6 4\n3\n4\n\u2212 (gs \u03c6) \u2212 (gs \u03c6) + gv (V\u03bc V \u03bc )2\n3!\n4!\n\u0003\n\u00024!\n(2)\n+ g\u03c12 b\u03bc * b\u03bc \u039bs gs2 \u03c62 + \u039bv gv2 V\u03bc V \u03bc .\n\nThe model contains an isodoublet nucleon field (\u03c8) interacting via the exchange of two isoscalar mesons, the\nscalar sigma (\u03c6)and the vector omega (V \u03bc ), one isovector\nmeson, the rho (b\u03bc ), and the photon (A\u03bc ). In addition\nto meson-nucleon interactions the Lagrangian density includes scalar and vector self-interactions. Omega-meson\nself-interactions \u03b6 soften the equation of state at high\ndensity. Finally, the nonlinear couplings \u039bs and \u039bv are\nincluded to modify the density-dependence of the symmetry energy asym (\u03c1) [24,25,26]. We employ Eq. (2) in\na mean field approximation where the meson fields are\nreplaced by their ground state expectation values. The\ncouplings constants in Eq. (2) are fit to nuclear matter and finite nuclei properties. All of the parameter\nsets considered here, namely, NL3 [28], S271 [24], and\nZ271 [24] reproduce the following properties of symmetric nuclear matter: saturation at a Fermi momentum of\nkF = 1.30 fm\u22121 with a binding energy per nucleon of\n\u221216.24 MeV and an incompressibility of K = 271 MeV.\nThe various parameter sets differ in their effective masses\nat saturation density, in their \u03c9-meson self interactions\n(which are included for Z271 and neglected for NL3 and\nS271) and in the nonlinear couplings \u039bs and \u039bv (see\nTable I). Note that the NL3 parametrization has been\nused extensively to reproduce a variety of nuclear properties [28].\n\n2\n\n\fThe symmetry energy at saturation density is not well\nconstrained experimentally. However, an average of the\nsymmetry energy at saturation density and the surface\nsymmetry energy is constrained by the binding energy\nof nuclei. Thus, the following prescription has been\nadopted: the value of the N N \u03c1 coupling constant is adjusted so that all parameter sets have a symmetry energy\nof 25.67 MeV at kF = 1.15 fm\u22121 . This insures accurate\nbinding energies for heavy nuclei, such as 208 Pb. Following this prescription the symmetry energy at saturation\ndensity is predicted to be 37.3, 36.6, and 36.3 MeV for\nparameter sets NL3, S271, and Z271, respectively (for\n\u039bs = \u039bv = 0). Changing \u039bs or \u039bv changes the density\ndependence of the symmetry energy by changing the effective rho-meson mass. In general increasing either \u039bs\nor \u039bv causes the symmetry energy to grow more slowly\nwith density.\nThe neutron radius of 208 Pb depends on the density dependence of the symmetry energy. A large pressure for\nneutron matter pushes neutrons out against surface tension and leads to a large neutron radius. The pressure depends on the derivative of the energy of symmetric matter\nwith respect to density (which is approximately known)\nand the derivative of the symmetry energy, dasym /d\u03c1.\nThus parameter sets with a large dasym /d\u03c1 yield a large\nneutron radius in 208 Pb. Note that all parameter sets\napproximately reproduce the observed proton radius and\nbinding energy of 208 Pb. Therefore changing \u039bs or \u039bv\nallows one to change the density dependence of the symmetry energy dasym /d\u03c1, while keeping many other properties fixed. Once the model parameters have been fixed,\nit is a simple matter to calculate the EOS for uniform\nmatter in beta equilibrium, where the chemical potentials of the neutrons \u03bcn , protons \u03bcp , electrons \u03bce , and\nmuons \u03bc\u03bc satisfy,\n\u03bcn \u2212 \u03bcp = \u03bce = \u03bc\u03bc .\n\nIII. BOUNDARY BETWEEN CRUST AND\nINTERIOR\n\nNeutron stars are expected to have a solid inner crust\nof nonuniform neutron-rich matter above a liquid mantle. The phase transition from solid to liquid is thought\nto be weakly first order and can be found by comparing\na detailed model of the nonuniform crust to the liquid\n(see for example [29]). Yet in practice, model calculations yield very small density discontinuities at the transition. Therefore a good approximation is to search for\nthe density where the uniform liquid first becomes unstable to small amplitude density oscillations (see for example [30]). This method would yield the exact transition\ndensity for a second order phase transition.\nThe stability analysis of the uniform ground state is\nbased on the relativistic random-phase-approximation\n(RPA) of Ref. [31] for a system of electrons, protons,\nand neutrons. The approach is generalized here to accommodate the various nonlinear couplings among the\nmeson fields. We start by considering a plane wave density fluctuation of momentum q = |q| and zero energy\nq0 = 0. To describe small amplitude particle-hole (or\nparticle-antiparticle) excitations of the fermions we compute the longitudinal polarization matrix that is defined\nas follows:\n\uf8eb e\n\uf8f6\n0\n0\n0\n\u03a000\n\u03a0ns + \u03a0ps \u03a0pm \u03a0nm \uf8f7\n\uf8ec 0\n\u03a0L = \uf8ed\n(4)\n\uf8f8 .\n0\n\u03a0pm\n\u03a0p00\n0\n0\n\u03a0n00\n0\n\u03a0nm\nHere the one-one entry describes electrons, the twotwo entry protons plus neutrons interacting via scalar\nmesons, the three-three entry protons interacting with\nvector mesons and the four-four entry neutrons interacting with vector mesons.

This value corresponds to a minimum pressure\nof Pmin = 6.08 \u00d7 10\u221215 MeV/fm3 , which is the value\nat which we stop integrating the Tolman-OppenheimerVolkoff equations. That is, the radius R of a neutron\nstar (see Sec. IV) is defined by the expression P (R) =\nPmin . For the relativistic mean field interaction (TM1) of\nRef. [35], the relatively simple procedure presented here\nis a good approximation to the more complicated explicit\ncalculation of the EOS in the inner crust [36].\n\nWe estimate the transition density (\u03c1c ) between the inner\ncrust and the liquid interior as the largest density for\nwhich Eq. (16) has a solution. Our results for \u03c1c are\nlisted in Tables II-V and also shown in Fig. 1. We find a\nstrong correlation between the neutron skin of 208 Pb and\n\u03c1c , as originally discussed in Ref. [24].\n0.1\nNL3\nS271\nZ271s\nZ271v\n\n0.09\n\n-3\n\n\u03c1c (fm )\n\n0.08\n\nIV. RESULTS\n\n0.07\n\nFigures 2-5 and Tables II-V show the radii of neutron\nstars of mass 1/3, 1/2, 3/4 and 1.4 M\u2299 as a function of\nthe neutron skin (Rn -Rp ) of 208 Pb. One might expect a\nstrong correlation between the radius of a neutron star\nand the neutron radius of 208 Pb, as the same pressure of\nneutron rich matter that pushes neutrons out against surface tension in 208 Pb pushes neutrons out against gravity\nin a neutron star [25]. However, the central density of a\n1.4M\u2299 neutron star is a few times larger than normal\nnuclear-matter saturation density \u03c10 . Thus, R(1.4M\u2299 )\ndepends on the EOS at low and high densities while Rn\nonly depends on the EOS for \u03c1 \u2264 \u03c10 . Softening the EOS\n(i.e., decreasing the pressure) at high densities will decrease R(1.4M\u2299) without changing Rn . Hence, while\nFig. 5 shows a definite correlation-R(1.4M\u2299) grows with\nincreasing Rn -Rp -there is a strong model dependence.\nIn contrast, the central density of a 12 M\u2299 star is of\nthe order of \u03c10 , so R( 21 M\u2299 ) and Rn depend on the EOS\nover a comparable density range. As a result, we find a\nstrong correlation and weak model dependence in Fig. 3.\nFor example, if Rn -Rp in 208 Pb is relatively large, e.g,\nRn \u2212Rp \u2248 0.25 fm, then R( 21 M\u2299 ) \u2248 16 km. Alternatively,\nif Rn \u2212 Rp \u2248 0.15 fm, then R( 21 M\u2299 ) <\n\u223c 13 km. This is\nan important result. It suggest that even if observations\nof low mass neutron stars are not feasible, one could still\ninfer their radii from a single nuclear measurement. Note\nthat the results for a 34 M\u2299 neutron star (Fig. 4) follow a\nsimilar trend.\nWe conclude this section with a comment on 31 M\u2299 neutron stars. Parameter sets that generate very large values for Rn\u2212Rp have large pressures near \u03c10 . This implies\nthat the energy of neutron rich matter rises rapidly with\ndensity. In turn, this leads (because all parameter sets\nare constrained to have the same symmetry energy at\n\u03c1 = 0.1 fm\u22123 ) to lower energies and lower pressures at\nvery low density as compared with parameter sets with\nsmaller values for Rn \u2212 Rp . This low-density region is\nimportant for low mass neutron stars and could explain\nwhy R( 31 M\u2299 ) in Fig. 2 actually decreases with increasing\nneutron skin for Rn \u2212Rp >\n\u223c 0.23 fm.\n\n0.06\n\n0.15\n\n0.2\n\n0.25\nRn-Rp (fm)\n\nFIG. 1.

At present we do not\nhave microscopic calculations of these structures in our\nmodels. Therefore we adopt a simple interpolation formula to estimate the equation of state in the inner crust.\nThat is, we assume a polytropic form for the EOS in\nwhich the pressure is approximately given by [14],\nP (\u01eb) = A + B\u01eb4/3 ,\n\n(17)\n\nwhere \u01eb is the mass-energy density. The two constants\nA and B in Eq. (17) are chosen so that the pressure is\ncontinuous at the boundary between the inner crust and\nthe liquid interior (determined from the RPA analysis)\nand at the boundary between the inner and the outer\ncrusts. For the low density outer crust we assume the\nEOS of Baym, Pethick, and Sutherland(BPS) [34] up to\na baryon density of \u03c1outer = 2.57\u00d710\u22124 fm\u22123 which corresponds to an energy density of \u01ebouter = 4.30 \u00d7 1011 g/cm3\n(or 0.24 MeV/fm3 ) and a pressure of Pouter = 4.87 \u00d7\n10\u22124 MeV/fm3 . Thus the two constants A and B of\nEq.

Would a small radius be an indication\nthat the EOS is relatively soft at all densities and there\nis no phase transition, or is the EOS stiff at low density\nand undergoes an abrupt softening at high density from\na phase transition?\nTherefore, it is important to also make measurements\nthat are exclusively sensitive to the low density EOS. One\nobvious possibility is the radius of a low mass (\u2248 0.5M\u2299 )\nneutron star as it central density, close to \u03c10 , is much\nsmaller than that of a 1.4M\u2299 star. However such low\nmass stars may be very rare because they are hard to\nform. Notably, the neutron radius of a heavy nucleus,\nsuch as 208 Pb, contains similar information. Indeed, we\nfind a strong correlation and a weak model dependence\nbetween the neutron radius of 208 Pb and the radius of a\n0.5M\u2299 neutron star. This allows one to use nuclear information to infer the radius of a low mass neutron star.\nHence, comparing this inferred radius to the measured radius of a \u2243 1.4M\u2299 neutron star, should provide the most\ncomplete information to date on the density dependence\nof the equation of state.\nThis work was supported in part by DOE grants DEFG02-87ER40365 and DE-FG05-92ER40750.\n\nV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nA number of relativistic effective field theory parameter sets have been used to study correlations between the\nradii of neutron stars and the neutron radius Rn of 208 Pb.\nAn RPA stability analysis was employed to find the transition density between the nonuniform inner crust and\nthe uniform liquid interior. For the nonuniform outer\ncrust we invoked the EOS of Baym, Pethick, and Sutherland [34]. Then, a simple polytropic formula for the EOS,\napproximately valid for most of the crust [14], was used\nto interpolate between the outer crust and the liquid interior. This simple, yet fairly accurate, procedure allows\nus to study the EOS for a variety of parameter sets that\npredict a wide range of values for the neutron radius of\n208\nPb.\nFor a \"normal\" 1.4M\u2299 neutron star we find central\ndensities of several times normal nuclear matter saturation density (\u03c10 \u2248 0.15 fm3 ). Because the neutron radius\nof 208 Pb does not constrain the high-density component\nof the EOS, we find a strong model dependence between\nthe radius of a 1.4M\u2299 neutron star and Rn . In contrast,\nthe central density of a low mass neutron star is close to\n\u03c10 . Therefore properties of the low mass star are sensitive to the EOS over the same density range as Rn . As\na result, we find a strong correlation and a weak model\ndependence between the radius of a 0.5M\u2299 neutron star\nand Rn (see Fig. 3). Thus, it should be possible to infer\nsome properties of low mass neutron stars from detailed\nmeasurements in atomic nuclei.\nUnderstanding the density dependence of the equation\nof state is particularly interesting. A softening of the\nEOS at high density (where the pressure rises slower than\nexpected) could signal the transition to an exotic phase,\nsuch as pion/kaon condensates, strange quark matter,\nand/or a color superconductor. Yet obtaining definitive\nresults on the density dependence of the EOS may require\nmeasuring the radius of neutron stars for a broad range\nof masses. This may be difficult as most compilations to\ndate find neutron star masses in the very narrow range of\n1.25 \u2212 1.44 M\u2299 [7]. Further, important ambiguities will\n\n8\n\n\fVI.
