Introduction.\nThe link between the field equations and the equations of motion in\ngravitational theories has been subject to many works. In the context of\nthe theory of general relativity the earliest accounts of this feature can\nbe found in the works of Weyl [17], Eddington [4], Einstein & Grommer\n[5], Einstein, Infeld & Hoffmann [6], as well as Fock [7]. Nowadays this is\ncustomarily addressed as the \"problem of motion\".\nOne of the early contributers in this field - to whom's life and work this\nconference is dedicated - was Myron Mathisson, who published a series of\nworks [9, 10, 11] on the problem of motion, in particular the systematic\naccount [12], over seventy years ago.\n\u2217\n\nPresented at: Myron Mathisson: his life, work, and influence on current research,\nStefan Banach International Mathematical Center, Warsaw, Poland, 18 \u2013 20 October,\n2007\n\n(1)\n\n\f2\n\nHere we provide an answer to the question of how test particles move\nunder the influence of the gravitational field in gauge gravity models. We\nbase our considerations on the theory of metric-affine gravity, see [8] for a\nreview. Metric-affine gravity provides a proper physical and mathematical\nframework for many gravitational models, in particular it allows for a unified\ndescription of a large class of alternative gravity theories. In contrast to the\ntheory of general relativity, the spacetime must no longer be structured\naccording to the Riemannian scheme in such a theory. Furthermore, not\nonly the energy-momentum, but also the hypermomentum \u2013 which describes\nintrinsic properties of matter like the spin, dilation, and shear currents \u2013\nmay act as source of the gravitational field.\nTo our knowledge the program laid out by Mathisson [12], and its later\nrealization by Dixon [1, 2, 3], remains unrivaled with respect to its mathematical rigor. Nevertheless, we do not employ it here, but make use of a\nmultipole approximation scheme in the spirit of Papapetrou [15] to derive\nthe equations of motion of pole-dipole test particles. The reason for this\nis the simplicity of the scheme and its direct applicability to the type of\ntheories which we are interested in.\n2. Metric-affine gravity.\nIn metric-affine gravity, besides the usual \"weak\" long-range NewtonEinstein type gravity, described by the metric gij of spacetime, an additional \"strong\" short-range gravity piece is mediated by the independent\nlinear connection \u0393ij k . It is different from the Riemannian (Christoffel)\nconnection, and the difference is described in terms of the tensors of nonmetricity Qijk := \u2212\u2207i gjk and of the torsion Sij k := \u0393ij k \u2212 \u0393ji k which are\nalso manifest in the non-Riemannian pieces of the curvature Rijk l .\nThe matter currents, which are the sources of the gravitational field,\nare obtained by variation of the matter Lagrangian with respect to the\ngravitational potentials (metric gij , coframe h\u03b1j , connection \u0393ij k ). This\nyields the canonical energy-momentum Ti j := h\u03b1i \u03b4Lmat /\u03b4h\u03b1j , the metrical\nenergy-momentum tij := 2\u03b4Lmat /\u03b4gij , and the hypermomentum \u2206i j k :=\n\u03b4Lmat /\u03b4\u0393ki j current.\n2.1. Energy-momentum conservation.\nThe Noether theorem for the diffeomorphism invariance of the matter\naction yields the conservation law, see [14] for a recent review, of the energymomentum\n{}\n\u2207j\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n{}\n\n{}\n\nTi j \u2212 Nikl \u2206klj = ( R ijkl \u2212 \u2207 i Njkl )\u2206klj .\n\n(1)\n\n\f3\n\nHere, and in the following, curled braces \"{}\" denote objects which are\nbased on the symmetric Riemannian connection (Christoffel symbols), and\n{}\n\nNij k := \u0393 ij k \u2212 \u0393ij k represents the so-called distorsion tensor. Equation (1)\ncan be identically rewritten as\n{}\n\u2207j\n\n{}\n\nb ijkl \u2206klj + Nikl \u2207 j \u2206klj ,\nTi j = R\n{}\n\n{}\n\n(2)\n\n{}\n\nb\nwhere we introduced R\nijkl := R ijkl \u2212 \u2207 i Njkl + \u2207 j Nikl .\n\n2.2. Hypermomentum conservation\n\nThe Noether theorem for the invariance of metric-affine gravity under\nthe local general linear group yields (on the \"mass shell\", i.e., when the\nmatter satisfies the field equations):\n{}\n\u2207j\n\n\u2206klj \u2212 Nij k \u2206jli + N jli \u2206k ij + T lk \u2212 tkl = 0.\n\n(3)\n\n3. Equations of motion.\nDenoting the densities of objects by a tilde \" e \" the conservation equations for the canonical energy-momentum current (2) and hypermomentum\ncurrent (3), take the following form\ne k j + \u0393ij k Te j + Nij k tej ,\n\u2202j Tei j = Rijk l \u2206\nl\nk\nk\n\nek j\n\u2202j \u2206\nl\n\nmek\n\n= \u0393jl \u2206\n\nm\n\nj\n\n\u2212\n\nej m\n\u0393mj \u2206\nl\nk\n\n(4)\n\n\u2212 Tel + t l .\nk\n\nek\n\n(5)\n\nNote that \u0393ij k represents the full connection. The last two equations should\nbe compared to (42) and (43) in [18], as well as (3.13) and (3.14) in [13].\n3.1. Integrated moments.\nWe introduce the integrated multipole moments of the matter currents\nas follows:\n\u2206b1 ***bn i j k\nT b1 ***bn i j\nt\n\nb1 ***bn i\n\nj\n\n: =\n: =\n: =\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\nn\nY\n\n\u03b1=1\nn\nY\n\n\u03b1=1\nn\nY\n\n\u03b1=1\n\n\u03b4x\n\nb\u03b1\n\n\u03b4x\n\nb\u03b1\n\n\u03b4x\n\nb\u03b1\n\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\ne ij k ,\n\u2206\n\nTei j ,\n\ntei j .\n\n(6)\n\n\f4\n\nHere \u03b4xa := xa \u2212 Y a , where Y parametrizes the worldline. Note the difference with respect to method of Mathisson and Dixon, who use an implicit\ndefinition of the moments, at this point. The integrals are taken over a\n3-dimensional slice \u03a3(t), at a time t, of the world tube of a test body. We\nuse the condensed notation\nZ\n\nf=\n\nZ\n\nf (x) d3 x.\n\n(7)\n\n\u03a3(t)\n\n3.2. Propagation equations for pole-dipole particles.\nFrom the expressions (4) and (5) we can derive the propagation equations for pole-dipole particles.1 For such bodies the following moments are\nassumed to be non-vanishing: \u2206i j k , T i j , T i j k , ti j , and tij k . The expansion\nof geometrical quantities around the worldline Y (t) of the body into a power\nseries in \u03b4xa , reads\nRijk l\n\u0393ij k\nNij k\n\nx\nx\nx\n\n= Rijk l\n= \u0393ij k\n= Nij k\n\n+ \u03b4xa Rijk l ,a\n\nY\n\n+ \u03b4xa \u0393ij k ,a\n\nY\nY\n\n+ ...,\n\nY\n\n+ \u03b4xa Nij k ,a\n\n+ ...,\n\nY\n\nY\n\n+ ....\n\n(8)\n\nIn the following we are going to suppress the dependencies on the points\nat which certain quantities are evaluated. Furthermore, we introduce new\nnames for the integrated quantities as follows: P i := T i 0 denotes the\nintegrated 4-momentum, Lk l := T k l 0 the total orbital canonical energymomentum, Y k l := \u2206k l 0 the integrated intrinsic hypermomentum, and\n{}\n\nPi := P i \u2212 Nik l Y k l \u2212 \u0393 ik l Lk l ,\n\n(9)\n\nthe generalized total 4-momentum. In addition, we introduce a shorter\nnotation for the \"convective currents\": For the intrinsic hypermomentum\n(c)\n\nwe have \u2206 k l m := \u2206k l m \u2212 v m \u2206k l 0 , and for the orbital canonical energy(c)\n\nmomentum T k l m := T k l m \u2212 v m T k l 0 . The fluid derivative is defined as\nfollows \u2207v Y i k := d/dt Y i k + v m \u0393mj i Y j k \u2212 v m \u0393mk j Y i j , here v a := dY a /dt.\nWith this notation, the integrated version of the conservation laws (4) and\n(5) yields the propagation equations\n{}\n\u2207 v Pi\n1\n\n=\n\n{}\nR ijk l\n\n\u2212\n\n{}\n\u2207 i Njk l\n\n!\n\n{}\n\n(c)\n\n{}\n\n\u2206k l j + R ijk l T k l j + R kji l Lk l v j ,\n\nMore details on the derivation can be found in [16].\n\n(10)\n\n\f5\n\nT k i = vi P k +\n(c)\nT (a i b)\n\n(c)\n{}\nd i\nL k \u2212 \u0393 kj l T i l j + Nkj l \u2206 j l i ,\ndt\n\n= 0,\n\n(12)\n\n\u2207 v Y i k = \u2212 T k i + ti k \u2212\n(c)\n\u2206k la\n\n(11)\n\n(c)\n\u0393jl i \u2206 l k j\n\n(c)\n\n+ \u0393jk l \u2206 i l j ,\n\n= T a l k \u2212 tak l .\n\n(13)\n(14)\n\nThe propagation equation (10) for the generalized total 4-momentum should\nbe compared to (5.7) in [15], (53) in [18], and (5.19) in [13]. Equation (11)\ndescribes the canonical energy-momentum in terms of the usual combination\nof the \"translational\" plus \"orbital\" contributions (the first two terms), plus\nthe additional contribution of the first moments. Equation (12) simply tells\n(c)\n\nus that the convective current T a i b is antisymmetric in the upper indices\na and b. The next equation (13) is actually an equation of motion for the\nintrinsic hypermomentum. Its form closely follows the Noether conservation\nlaw of the hypermomentum, cf. (3). Finally, the equation (14) expresses the\nconvective intrinsic hypermomentum current in terms of the first moments\nof the energy-momentum.\n4. Conclusions.\nThe set (10)-(14) can be viewed as the generalization of the well-known\nMathisson-Papapetrou equations for pole-dipole test particles to almost any\nknown gauge gravity model. The Mathisson-Papapetrou equations, as well\nas previous results in the context of spacetimes with torsion [18, 13], can be\neasily recovered in our framework, see [16] for details.\nWe notice a general feature that characterizes the coupling between the\nphysical objects (currents) with the geometrical objects (metric, connection,\nand the derived quantities). Namely, the intrinsic current (the one that is\ntruly microscopic, which arises from the averaging over the medium with the\nelements with microstructure, i.e., that possess internal degrees of freedom)\ncouples to the non-Riemannian geometric quantities, see the second term\non the r.h.s. of (9) and the first term on the r.h.s. of (10). In contrast\nto this, the orbital canonical energy-momentum (which is induced by the\nmacroscopic dynamics of the rotating and deformable body) is only coupled\nto the purely Riemannian geometric variables and never couples to the nonRiemannian geometry, see the last terms on the right-hand sides of (9) and\n(10). This observation demonstrates that the possible presence of the nonRiemannian geometry (in particular, of torsion and nonmetricity) can only\nbe tested with the help of bodies that are constructed from media with\n\n\f6\n\nmicrostructure (spin, dilaton charge, and intrinsic shear). Test particles,\ncomposed from usual matter without microstructure, are not affected by the\nnon-Riemannian geometry, and they thus cannot be used for the detection\nof the torsion and the nonmetricity.\nIt would be very interesting to carry out an analysis in the spirit of\nMathisson and to compare the results to the ones obtained in this work.\nAcknowledgments\nI am very grateful to A.
