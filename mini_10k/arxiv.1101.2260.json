INTRODUCTION\n\nCarbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars are quite\ncommon in the halo populations of the Milky Way, and\nare of particular interest, as they preserve important\nastrophysical information concerning the early chemical evolution of the Galaxy (Beers & Christlieb 2005).\nPrevious work has indicated that at least 20% of stars\nwith metallicities [Fe/H] < \u22122.0 exhibit large overkenne257@msu.edu\nsivarani@iiap.res.in\nbeers@pa.msu.edu, leeyou25@msu.edu\nvmplacco@astro.iag.usp.br, rossi@astro.iag.usp.br\nN.Christlieb@lsw.uni-heidelberg.de\nfherwig@uvic.ca\nbertrand.plez@graal.univ-montp2.fr\n\nabundances of carbon ([C/Fe] \u00bf +1.0; Lucatello et al.\n2006; Marsteller et al. 2009), although recent studies\n(e.g. Cohen et al. 2005; Frebel et al. 2006), have claimed\nthat this fraction is somewhat lower (9% and 14%, respectively, for [Fe/H] < \u22122.0). In any case, the fraction\nof CEMP stars rises to 30% for [Fe/H] < \u22123.0, 40% for\n[Fe/H] < \u22123.5, and 100% for [Fe/H] < \u22124.0 (Beers &\nChristlieb 2005; Frebel et al. 2005; Norris et al. 2007).\nThere exist a number of classes of CEMP stars, some\nof which have been associated with proposed progenitor objects. CEMP-s stars (those with s-process-element\nenhancement), for example, are the most commonly observed type to date. High-resolution spectroscopic studies have revealed that around 80% of CEMP stars exhibit\n\n\f2\ns-process-element enhancement (Aoki et al. 2007). The\nfavored mechanism invoked to account for these stars is\nmass transfer of carbon-enhanced material from the envelope of an asymptotic giant-branch (AGB) star to its\nbinary companion; it is this surviving binary companion\nthat is now observed as a CEMP-s star.\nThe class of CEMP-no stars (which exhibit no strong\nneutron-capture-element enhancements) are particularly\nprevalent among the most metal-poor stars. Possible progenitors for this class include massive, rapidlyrotating, mega metal-poor ([Fe/H] < \u22126.0) stars, which\nmodels suggest have greatly enhanced abundances of\nCNO due to distinctive internal burning and mixing\nepisodes, followed by strong mass loss (Meynet et al.\n2006; Hirschi et al. 2006; Meynet et al. 2010). Another suggested mechansim is pollution of the interstellar medium by so-called faint supernovae associated with\nthe first generations of stars, which experience extensive mixing and fallback during their explosions (Umeda\n& Nomoto 2003, 2005; Tominaga et al. 2007); high\n[C/Fe] and [O/Fe] ratios are predicted in the ejected material. This model well reproduces the observed abundance pattern of the CEMP-no star BD+44:493, the\nninth-magnitude [Fe/H] = \u22123.7 star (with [C/Fe]= +1.3,\n[N/Fe] = +0.3, [O/Fe] = +1.6) discussed by Ito et al.\n(2009).\nThe great majority of known CEMP stars were originally identified as metal-poor candidates from objectiveprism surveys, such as the HK survey (Beers et al. 1985,\n1992), and the Hamburg/ESO Survey (HES; Christlieb\n2003; Christlieb et al. 2008), based on a weak (or absent) Ca II K line. Some candidate CEMP stars also\ncome from a list of HES stars selected from the prism\nplates based on their strong molecular lines of carbon\n(Christlieb et al. 2001). Medium-resolution spectra\nfor most of these objects have been obtained over the\npast few years (Goswami et al. 2006; Marsteller 2007;\nGoswami et al. 2010, Sivarani et al., in preparation). Inspection of these data indicate that at least 50% of these\ntargets are consistent with identification as CEMP stars,\nwhile the others are roughly solar-metallicity carbon-rich\nstars. Dedicated surveys for CEMP stars covering a wide\nrange of carbon abundance and metallicities are just now\ngetting underway, based on the observed strength of the\nCH G band measured from the HES prism plates (e.g.,\nPlacco et al. 2010).\nIn order to more fully test the association of CEMP-no\nstars with massive primordial stars and/or faint supernovae, and to better explore the nature of the s-process\nin low-metallicity AGB stars (which is still rather poorly\nunderstood; Herwig 2005), we require measurements of\nthe important elements C, N, and O for as large a sample of CEMP stars as possible. While estimates of carbon and nitrogen abundances can be determined from\nmedium-resolution optical or near-UV spectra of CEMP\nstars (e.g., Rossi et al. 2005; Beers et al. 2007b; Johnson et al. 2007; Marsteller et al. 2009), high-resolution\nspectroscopy is usually required in order to obtain estimates of oxygen abundances from the forbidden [O I]\n\u03bb6300 \u00c5 line, the \u03bb7700 \u00c5 triplet (e.g., Schuler et al.\n2006; Sivarani et al. 2006; Fabbian et al. 2009, and\nreferences therein), or the OH lines at 1.5-1.7 \u03bcm (Melendez & Barbuy 2002). Masseron et al. (2010) provides\n\na useful compilation of known elemental abundances for\nCEMP stars. In addition to abundance measurements\nfor metal-poor halo stars, oxygen abundances have also\nbeen measured directly in the gas phase in damped Lyman \u03b1 systems (Pettini et al. 2002, 2008).\nIf a star has a measured carbon abundance (and, assuming C/O > 1, which applies for most CEMP stars),\nessentially all of the O is locked up in CO molecules, and\nmedium-resolution spectroscopy of the CO ro-vibrational\nbands in the near-IR can be used for estimation of\n[O/Fe] (e.g., Beers et al. 2007b, and references therein).\nAlthough one sacrifices measurement accuracy, relative\nto high-resolution studies, this approach has the great\nadvantage that medium-resolution spectroscopy can be\ngathered far faster than high-resolution spectroscopy, ensuring that much larger samples of stars can be investigated. In addition, the large separation of the 13 CO\nlines from the 12 CO lines at 2.3\u03bcm provides a straightforward means to measure the important mixing diagnostic\n12\nC/13 C, as long as the S/N of the spectra are sufficient.\nThis paper is outlined as follows. In Section 2 we discuss details of the observations and data reduction procedures used in the present study. Section 3 describes the\npreviously determined atmospheric parameter estimates\nand their origins, as well as details about the synthetic\nspectra. Methods used for determination of [O/Fe] for\nour sample of stars are described in Section 4. Our results, and a statistical comparison to high-resolution estimates of [C/Fe] and [O/Fe] for a subset of our program\nstars can be found in Section 5. Section 6 is a short\ndiscussion of our results; conclusions follow in Section 7.\n2. OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION\n\nOur sample of 57 stars was selected from the Hamburg/ESO Survey (HES), based on follow-up mediumresolution optical spectra obtained during the course of\nsearches for low-metallicity stars. These optical spectra were obtained with the GOLDCAM spectrograph\non the KPNO 2.1m telescope and with the RC Spectrographs on the 4m KPNO and CTIO telescopes (see\nBeers et al. 2007b, hereafter Paper I). Additional targets were selected from the list of carbon-rich candidates\npublished by Christlieb et al. (2001) with available optical spectra. Based on the optical spectra, all of the\ncandidates are metal-poor stars, spanning the metallicity range \u22122.8 \u2264 [Fe/H] \u2264 \u22121.0. All of the stars were\nselected to be carbon-rich, with the majority exhibiting\n[C/Fe] \u2265 +1.0, and thus are carbon-enhanced as defined\nby Beers & Christlieb (2005). Since our intention was to\nobtain near-IR spectroscopy of the CO features, the stars\nwere also selected to have effective temperatures less than\n5000 K, since warmer stars do not exhibit strong CO.\nEstimates of [O/Fe] for our program stars are derived from analysis of medium-resolution near-IR spectra\ntaken with the SOAR 4.1m telescope, using the OSIRIS\n(Ohio State InfraRed Imager/Spectrometer; Depoy et al.\n1993) spectrograph during October 2005 to June 2008.\nWe used the long slit (width set to 1\u2032\u2032 ) and long camera\n(with focal ratio f/7), which provided a resolving power\nR = 3000. The long-pass K-band filter was used to isolate the spectral region from 2.25\u03bcm to 2.45\u03bcm. Visible\nin this band are the four ro-vibrational CO features used\nfor the determination of [O/Fe]. We also observed A0type stars at the same airmass as the observations of\n\n\f3\nthe program objects in order to correct for the presence\nof telluric lines in the spectra. The K-band magnitude\nrange for our sample stars is \u223c 7 \u2212 12, resulting in exposure times in the range 600-2400 seconds in order to\nreach our targeted S/N ratio of 50/1. Spectra of ArNe\narc lamps, taken before or after each program star, were\nused for the wavelength calibration of our sample. Bias\ncorrection, flat-fielding, spectral extraction, wavelength\ncalibration, telluric feature correction, and continuum\nnormalization were all performed using standard IRAF\npackages1.\n3. ADOPTED ATMOSPHERIC PARAMETERS AND\nSYNTHETIC SPECTRA\n\nAtmospheric parameters (Teff , log g, and [Fe/H])\nwere estimated from available optical and near-IR photometry, as well as from previously obtained mediumresolution optical spectroscopy. Estimates of Teff are obtained from measured V\u2212K colors (taken from Beers et\nal. 2007a, and references therein, as well as from the\n2MASS Point Source Catalog; Skrutskie et al. 2006).\nThe use of near-IR photometry provides for a more accurate determination of Teff , as the K band is less influenced\nby the presence of carbon features than bluer bands. We\nused the Alonso et al. (1996) calibrations of Teff with\nV\u2212K colors, as described in Paper I. Surface gravities,\nlog g, have been been estimated based on the Padova\nevolutionary tracks for metallicities [Fe/H]= \u22122.5 and\n[Fe/H]= \u22121.7 (Girardi et al. 2000; Marigo et al. 2001).\nUncertainties in Teff and log g are 100 K and 0.5 dex,\nrespectively. The microturbulence is taken to be 2 km\ns\u22121 for all stars. This is consistent with previouslydetermined microturbulence values for giant CEMP stars\n(Johnson et al. 2007; Aoki et al. 2007).\nWe have constructed two sets of synthetic spectral templates, covering the optical and near-IR bands. Each set\nconsists of 2000 synthetic spectra with carbon-enhanced\natmospheres generated with the MARCS code (Gustafsson et al. 2008). We used a previous generation of models\nhere, as updated CEMP models were not available. We\ndo not, however, anticipate large differences in the models of spectra. The use of carbon-enhanced models is of\nparticular importance for cool CEMP stars, for which\nthe atmospheric structure is significantly altered by carbon (Masseron et al. 2006). No 3D\u21921D corrections have\nbeen applied to our estimates. Recent studies of these effects on two hyper metal-poor stars (Collet et al. 2006)\nhave revealed [O/Fe] corrections of \u223c \u22120.8 based on OH\nmolecules, thereby lowering the measured abundance of\noxygen. However, the magnitude of such corrections is\nexpected to decrease with increasing metallicity (Collet\net al. 2007). As the metallicities of our targets range\nfrom \u22121.0 to \u22122.8, it is likely that the 3D effects are less\nsevere. In addition, more recent studies have been carried\nout (A. Ivanauskas, private communication) concerning\nthe effects of convection on C2 , CH, CN, CO, NH, and\nOH molecules. When compared to the results from Collet et al. (2006), the magnitude of the corrections appear\nsmaller.\n1 IRAF is distributed by the National Optical Astronomy Observatories, which is operated by the Association of Universities\nfor Research in Astronomy, Inc. under cooperative agreement with\nthe National Science Foundation.\n\nThe synthetic grid covers a range Teff = 4000 to 6000K\n, log g = 0.0 to 5.0, [Fe/H] = \u22125.0 to 0.0, and [C/Fe]\n= 0.0 to +4.0. We adopt fixed nitrogen abundances set\nto 0.5 dex less than the carbon abundances, which is\nroughly appropriate for CEMP stars. The CH and CN\nlinelists used for the synthesis of the optical spectra are\nthose compiled by Plez (see Plez & Cohen 2005). The\nCO linelists used for the near-IR synthesis are taken from\nKurucz (1993). The synthetic grids are then degraded\nto match the resolving power of the observed spectra\n(R = 2000 for the optical spectra, R = 3000 for the\nnear-IR spectra).\nThe optical spectra are used for the determination of\n[Fe/H] and [C/H]. The Ca II K line is matched with the\nmodel spectra to estimate [Fe/H], and the C2 and CN\nfeatures are fit for the estimation of [C/H] (see Paper\nI). Our adopted atmospheric parameters, as well as the\nderived [C/H] and [C/Fe], are listed in columns (2)-(6)\nof Table 1.\n4. DETERMINATION OF [O/H]\n\nIn order to determine [O/H] we employed the near-IR\nsynthetic spectra constructed from model atmospheres\nwith carbon enhancements (see above). Each synthetic\nspectrum covers the wavelength range 2.25\u03bcm\u22122.40\u03bcm.\nFor all combinations of these parameters, models were\navailable with [O/Fe] values of 0.0, +0.4, and +0.8.\nThe first step in the determination of [O/Fe] is to use\nthe grid of synthetic spectra in combination with the atmospheric parameters to create three models with [O/Fe]\nvalues of 0.0, +0.4, and +0.8. These models are then\nused in order to estimate the [O/Fe] of the program stars.\nEach star in the sample has a previously estimated Teff ,\nlog g, [Fe/H], and [C/Fe]. Given the fact that four parameters are known, the routine begins with 48 models:\n16 models for each value of [O/Fe]. The 48 models are\nselected as having the two closest values of Teff , log g,\n[Fe/H], and [C/Fe] for each of the three values of [O/Fe].\nOnce selected, a linear interpolation over each parameter\nis performed in order to create three final models, one for\neach value of [O/Fe], with the known values of the four\nparameters. The three final models for a set of typical\natmospheric parameters are shown in Figure 1. With\nthe other parameters fixed, it is easy to see how a typical spectrum changes with increasing oxygen abundance.\nNext, a linear interpolation over [O/Fe] is performed on\nthe three final models, creating new model spectra with\nvarying oxygen. It should be noted that while the interpolation was performed over [O/Fe], the metallicity is\nfixed, and therefore the oxygen varies as [O/H]. In some\ncases, it was necessary to extrapolate beyond the boundaries of the model grid in order to find a good fit to the\ndata.\nDue to the presence of four large CO band in the nearIR spectra, there were difficulties in fitting the continuum across the entire region. It was important to fit the\ncontinua with a low-order function so that the depth of\nthe absorption features were not artificially enhanced or\nlessened due to the continuum fit. For this reason, the\nspectra of all stars in the sample were trimmed around\neach of four CO bands, and a local continuum was fit\nfor each band prior to spectral synthesis. With the use\nof the synthetic spectra, oxygen abundances were then\nestimated individually for each of the four bands by min-\n\n\f4\nimizing \u03c72 . A robust average using bisquare weighting\nof the four separate values was taken as the final estimate of oxygen abundance, with an associated robust\nestimate of the scatter in these values taken as the error\nof determination.\nFigure 2 shows the fitting technique applied to four\nstars from the sample. Each row shows the four separate\nestimates of [O/H] for each star. Also plotted on each\npanel are synthetic spectra with [O/H] values that vary\nfrom the best-fitting spectra by \u00b10.5 dex. Once the robust average is applied the resulting estimates of [O/H]\nare \u22121.2 for HE 0111\u22121346, \u22120.5 for HE 0519\u22122053,\n\u22120.6 for HE 1207\u22123156, and \u22121.2 for HE 2339\u22120837.\n\noccupied by several classes of CEMP stars. Sources for\nthe high-resolution data for different classes of CEMP\nstars can be found in Masseron et al. (2010), and references therein. The majority of the stars in our sample\noccupy regions of the diagram as CEMP stars that have\nconfirmed, high-resolution measurements of s-processelement enhancements. There is clearly overlap with the\nregion occupied by CEMP-r/s stars as well. Few of our\nstars overlap with the region occupied by CEMP-no stars\nin the literature; CEMP-no stars tend to be more metaldeficient than most of the stars in our sample.\n\n5. RESULTS\n\nFor 13 of our program stars, high-resolution estimates of [N/Fe] are available from S. Lucatello (private communication) and/or Aoki et al. (2007). We\nselected ten of these stars for which the available highresolution estimates of [C/Fe] were within 0.5 dex of\nour medium-resolution estimates. The three that are\nomitted from our analysis and discussion have associated\nhigh-resolution [Fe/H] and/or [C/H] estimates that differ significantly from the medium-resolution estimates of\nthese species. We report values of high-resolution [C/Fe],\n[C/Fe]h , using our estimates of [Fe/H] combined with\nthe high-resolution [C/H]. We report high-resolution estimates of [N/Fe], [N/Fe]h , by combining our estimates\nof [Fe/H] with the high-resolution values of [N/H]. Two\nof the ten stars had high-resolution estimates both from\nLucatello and Aoki et al. (2007), and an average of the\ntwo available estimates was taken.\nThe values of Teff , log g, [Fe/H], [C/H], [C/Fe],\n[C/Fe]h , [N/Fe]h , [O/H], [O/Fe], and \u03c3[O/F e] for our entire sample are listed in Table 1.\n\nThe distributions of [O/Fe] versus three of the parameters used for their determinations are shown in Figure\n3. The solid lines are linear fits to the data. For the entire sample, there are no significant correlations of [O/Fe]\nwith Teff , [Fe/H], or [C/Fe]. In the middle panel of Figure 3, it can be seen that only one of the stars in our\nsample with [Fe/H] < \u22122.5 has a value of [O/Fe] less\nthan +1.0. The bottom panel of Figure 3 shows the distribution of [O/Fe] versus [C/Fe], revealing that the majority of our sample (45 stars) have [C/Fe] > +1.0, and\nso meet the definition for CEMP stars given by Beers\n& Christlieb (2005). The other stars exhibit carbon enhancements of [C/Fe] \u2265 +0.5, and thus are at least moderately enhanced in carbon. The average error in the\ndetermination of [O/Fe] for our entire sample is 0.4 dex.\nWe adopted a minimum error for our [O/Fe] estimates of\n0.25 dex due to the influence of errors that arise from the\nestimation of Teff , log g, [Fe/H], and [C/Fe] (see Paper I\nfor details).\nIn Figure 4, a carbon cut has been made, such that\nonly the oxygen abundances for those stars with [C/Fe]\n> +1.75 are plotted against [Fe/H]. The stars with the\nhighest abundances of carbon exhibit some of the lowest\nmetallicities in our sample. This is not surprising, given\nthat high values of [C/Fe] are often associated with lower\nmetallicities. The fit to the data shows a slight trend of\nincreasing oxygen with decreasing metallicity. The solid\nline is a least squares fit of [O/Fe] as a function of [Fe/H].\nOnly a marginally significant slope (\u22120.616 \u00b1 0.314) is\nfound, hence the correlation is quite weak. For comparison, the dashed line in this figure represents the the fit\nof [O/Fe] versus [Fe/H] for the carbon-normal stars from\nthe Spite et al. (2005) sample. The [O/Fe] estimates of\nthe Spite et al. (2005) sample come from the forbidden\n[O I] \u03bb6300 \u00c5 line.\n5.1. Statistical Comparison to High-Resolution Oxygen\n\nEstimates\nThe present catalog of measured oxygen abundances\navailable in the literature for CEMP stars is still relatively small, due to the difficulty of obtaining estimates\nfrom optical spectra, even at high spectral resolution.\nHowever, we can at least compare the regions of the\n[O/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] parameter space that are occupied\nby CEMP stars of various sub-classes, based on previous\nhigh-resolution oxygen estimates, with those from our\npresent medium-resolution effort.\nFigure 5 shows [O/Fe] for our entire sample, with different boxes indicating the regions of parameter space\n\n5.2. High-Resolution Nitrogen Estimates\n\n6. DISCUSSION\n\nWe expect that the majority of CEMP stars in\nour sample have been polluted by a companion lowmetallicity AGB star. In an AGB star, intershell oxygen is predicted to be closely related to intershell 12 C,\nwhich in turn has a direct influence on the maximum\n13\nC abundance. By studying these abundances, we can\nbetter understand the nature of the s-process, as the\n13\nC(\u03b1, n)16 O reaction is a major neutron source for the\ns-process in AGB stars (Lugaro et al. 2003). According to current theory, oxygen production in AGB stars\nbecomes increasingly significant with decreasing metallicity (Herwig 2004, 2005; Campbell & Lattanzio 2008;\nLau et al. 2009). Since the overabundance of oxygen is\nsmaller at solar metallicities, lower metallicities are better suited for probing the primary production of oxygen.\nIn addition, the observed abundance patterns of elements\nproduced by the progenitor is expected to depend on the\nmass (and metallicity) of the AGB star (Herwig 2004;\nStancliffe & Glebbeek 2008).\nIn the following subsections we consider a number of\nissues that could potentially impact the interpretation\nof our measurements. First, we compare the results of\nour CEMP stars to those of carbon-normal metal-poor\nstars (Section 6.1). We then turn to recent literature\non the abundance yields of low-metallicity AGB models\nto compare with our derived C, N, and O abundances\n(Section 6.2). We also consider how dilution processes\nmight be expected to alter our abundances (Section 6.3).\nFinally, we address the sources of uncertainty in the AGB\n\n\f5\nmodels, and how these may lead to altered abundances\nof C, N, and O (Section 6.4).\n6.1. [O/Fe] in Carbon-Normal and Carbon-Enhanced\n\nMetal-Poor Stars\nThe linear fit to the full sample shown in the middle panel of Figure 3 is consistent with the fit from the\nSpite et al. (2005) sample. However, most of the values of [O/Fe] from the carbon-normal sample are tightly\ndistributed around a constant value of +0.7. Referring\nback to Figure 5, we see much more scatter in our values of [O/Fe] for the carbon-enhanced stars, with values\nreaching as high as +2.0. It can be inferred that metalpoor stars, regardless of carbon-enhancement, commonly\nexhibit enhancements of oxygen. However, when carbon\nenhancement is present, additional oxygen enhancement\ncan be expected as well, due to the fact that both of these\nelements are enhanced by some of the same mechanisms.\n6.2. C, N, and O: Comparison with AGB Models\n\nFor 10 of the 13 stars for which we report highresolution [N/Fe] estimates in Table 1, Figure 6 shows\n[C/Fe], [N/Fe], and [O/Fe] as a function of [Fe/H]. One\ncan notice an increase in the abundances of all three\nspecies with decreasing metallicity. The linear fits for\neach of the species all have approximately the same slope,\nsuggesting that abundances of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen are highly correlated with one another. With estimates of [C/Fe], [N/Fe], and [O/Fe], we can compare\nour results to the predictions of abundance yields due to\nAGB evolution as described by Herwig (2004). Both carbon and oxygen are dredged up to the surface in AGB\nstars after thermal pulses. The overabundance of these\nelements in low-metallicity AGB stars is larger for lower\ninitial masses (Herwig 2004), due to the fact that the\nintershell mass is larger. With a similarly large dredge\nup parameter and a smaller envelope, the enrichment of\nC and O in the envelope of a lower mass star is larger.\nThis can be seen in the top panel of Figure 7, where the\nabundance predictions for C, N, and O (Herwig 2004) are\nshown for five different AGB masses, ranging from 2 M\u2299\nto 6 M\u2299 , all with [Fe/H] = \u22122.3. The C, N, and O abundances for ten stars with available [N/Fe] in our sample\nare shown in a similar way in the lower two panels of Figure 7. For most of the stars, the relationship of carbon\nand oxygen is consistent with the models. The abundance pattern for HE 0017+0055 is a very close match to\nan AGB star of about 3 M\u2299 . The other nine stars exhibit\nsome discrepancy with respect to nitrogen, which has\nbeen noted before for other CEMP stars with s-process\nelement enhancement (Paper I; Sivarani et al. 2006). A\nprevious effort to search for metal-poor stars with large\nenhancements of nitrogen relative to carbon yielded similar abundances (Johnson et al. 2007). All but five of\nthe stars in our sample are giants, and thus more mixing\nand dilution of any material transferred from an AGB\ncompanion is expected, thereby resulting in such intermediate abundances of nitrogen (Paper I; Denissenkov &\nPinsonneault 2008). In addition, the possible occurence\nof H-ingestion flashes (HIF; Herwig 2003, 2005; Woodward et al. 2008; Hajduk et al. 2005; Campbell & Lattanzio 2008) could potentially enhance N in metal-poor\nstars.\n\nNitrogen is an element that is very sensitive to CN cycling, and the C/N ratio indicates if the CN cycle has\nbeen activated partially, or whether mixing and thermodynamic conditions have been such that the CN cycle has\nreached equilibrium. The latter is the case in hot-bottom\nburning (HBB), which is found in more massive AGB\nstars (Boothroyd et al. 1993). In this case, the bottom\nof the convective envelope connects with the H-burning\nshell, allowing processing of envelope CN material in the\nH-shell. Material lost at the surface is accordingly modified in its CN abundance ratios. The limiting mass for\nthe onset of HBB decreases with decreasing metallicity\nfrom \u223c 5 M\u2299 at Z = 0.02 to \u2264 3 M\u2299 for Z = 0.0 (Forestini & Charbonnel 1997; Siess et al. 2002). Stars which\nexperience HBB show a C/N ratio close to the equilibrium ratio (< 0.1), as can be seen also in Figure 7 for\nthe 4, 5, and 6 M\u2299 cases. On the contrary, the 2 and 3\nM\u2299 cases show very large C/N ratios. Not even partial\nCN cycling has occurred in these models, and the small\noverabundance of N is entirely due to the first and second\nDUP (Herwig 2004). Partial CN cycling at the bottom\nof low-mass giant envelope convection is a well observed\nand parametrically modeled feature (e.g. Denissenkov &\nVandenBerg 2003). Whether the same process operates\nin AGB stars as well is currently debated (e.g. Karakas\net al. 2010).\n6.3. Considering the Effects of Dilution\nNitrogen estimates only exist for ten of our stars. We\ncompared the carbon and oxygen predictions from Herwig (2004) to all of our CEMP stars. None of the stars\nwith available nitrogen estimates show the extremely low\nC/N ratio indicative of hot-bottom burning. We therefore restrict the comparison of our sample to the 2 and 3\nM\u2299 models from Herwig (2004). In Figure 8, we show all\nof our stars that have [C/Fe] \u2265 +1.0. The black square\nand the red triangle at the upper right of the figure are\nthe model predictions for 2 M\u2299 and 3 M\u2299 , respectively.\nClearly these predictions have higher carbon and oxygen\nestimates than our sample, but this is likely due to the\nfact that the effects of dilution are not considered. We\nconsider a parametric mixing model to test the effects of\ndilution of the accreted material from an AGB companion. We chose a range of initial masses of the observed\nstar (0.5 \u2212 0.9 M\u2299 ) and accreted masses (0.1 \u2212 0.5 M\u2299 )\nand assumed complete mixing. We set the maximum\nmass of the observed star at 1 M\u2299 . In order to consider only the AGB-phase contributions to carbon and\noxygen, we subtracted off the likely contribution to carbon and oxygen arising from pre-star formation enhancements. These contributions were chosen to be the average enhancements of carbon and oxygen from the Spite\net al. (2005) sample of unmixed metal-poor stars. The\nsubtracted enhancement of [C/Fe] was 0.18 \u00b1 0.16 dex\nand the subtracted enhancement of [O/Fe] was 0.7 \u00b1 0.17\ndex. The resulting predicted abundances based on this\nsimple dilution experiment are shown as the black and\nthe red lines in Figure 8. Once the effects of dilution are\nconsidered, the AGB predictions of Herwig (2004) fall\nwithin the parameter space of our sample. The magenta\nsymbols are for the range of metallicity that is most consistent with the AGB models. For lower metallicities, the\nAGB model values for [C/Fe] and [O/Fe] would be larger,\nand for higher metallicity, they would decrease (Herwig\n\n\f6\n2004).\n6.4. Uncertainties of the AGB Models\nThe models of Herwig (2004) should be considered as\nrather conservative, standard predictions that suffer from\nthe usual uncertainties associated mostly with convective mixing and mass loss. We can obtain an indication\nof the order of magnitude of these uncertainties by comparing the Herwig (2004) models with those of other authors. Comparing the 2 M\u2299 case with that of Cristallo\net al. (2009a), the carbon predictions agree very well,\nwhile the [N/Fe] prediction of Cristallo et al. (2009a) is\nabout 0.2 dex higher and their O-overabundance prediction is 0.8 dex lower than that of Herwig (2004). Karakas\n(2010) provides a comparison between her Z = 0.0001, 2\nM\u2299 yield predictions and that of Cristallo et al. (2009a)\nwhich shows that her C, N, and O yields are all approximately twice those of Cristallo et al. (2009a), which is\neasiest to be understood in terms of a lower mass loss rate\nin the Karakas (2010) yields. Karakas (2010) provides a\nmore in-depth discussion of model prediction differences\nfrom different authors.\nIn addition, we have to discuss uncertainties deriving\nfrom entirely alternative evolution scenarios. Here, we\nshould mention the possible occurrence of H-ingestion\nflashes (HIF), which have been introduced in Section\n6.2. These events are also referred to as proton-ingestion\nepisodes or double He-shell flashes. There are several\nuncertainties related to these combustion-type flashes in\nwhich protons are convectively mixed into the He-shell\nflash convection zone, and release energy on the dynamic\ntime scale of convective flows.\nFirst, the occurrence of these events, in which the Heshell flash convection zone has to break through the entropy barrier associated with the H-shell, is more likely\nwith lower CNO abundances in the envelope. For example, an alpha-enhancement of the initial abundance\ncomposition without change of [Fe/H] will make the HIF\nless likely or even suppress it (Cristallo et al. 2009a). If\nthe stars are rotating (Meynet & Maeder 2002), the CNO\nabundance may be enhanced during the core He-burning\nphase, which may also suppress the HIF (Herwig 2003).\nThe second uncertainty in HIF predictions is the quantitative mixing and nucleosynthesis in a convective combustion regime that breaks some of the assumptions of\nmixing-length theory and 1D spherically symmetric stellar evolution (Herwig et al. 2010). Keeping these significant uncertainties in mind, we nevertheless note that HIF\nmodels would predict the N signature of partial burning. For example, considering Figure 6 in Cristallo et\nal. (2009b), the prediction of a HIF model followed by\nmaybe only a few pulses would correspond well to the\nCNO abundance patterns observed in most of our stars\nshown in Figure 7.\n7. CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have used near-IR medium-resolution spectroscopy\nin order to estimate [O/Fe] for a sample of candidate\ncarbon-enhanced stars selected from the Hamburg/ESO\nSurvey. This method of abundance analysis allows us\nto obtain oxygen abundances accurate to about 0.4 dex.\nThe use of four separate CO features to estimate oxygen\nabundances from the near-IR spectra allows for more pre-\n\ncise estimates, based on a robust average of the independently determined fits. A large spread of derived [O/Fe]\nvalues are obtained for this sample, ranging from near\nthe solar value to as much as one hundred times greater.\nA comparison of our abundance determinations with\nhigh-resolution estimates was carried out. The values\nof [O/Fe] for our full set of 57 CEMP stars largely fall\nwithin regions of parameter space occupied by the highresolution estimates of oxygen for other CEMP stars. We\nalso found that the majority of our stars have oxygen\nabundances that are consistent with known CEMP-s and\nCEMP-r/s stars. Only a few stars could be considered\nCEMP-no stars, based on the data compiled in Masseron\net al. (2010). This is likely due to the fact that CEMPno stars commonly have lower metallicities than most of\nthe stars in this sample.\nOxygen enhancements (on the order of [O/Fe] = +0.7)\nhave also been observed in very metal-poor stars without\nsignificant carbon enhancement, indicating that there\nwere early oxygen-producing nucleosynthetic sites in the\nGalaxy independent of any enhancement by AGB evolution. However, we find that the [C/Fe], [O/Fe], and\n[N/Fe] (when available) estimates follow the patterns\nfrom Herwig (2004) closely enough that mass-transfer\nfrom a AGB companion is a likely scenario for many of\nthe stars in our sample, especially when the effects of\ndilution are considered.\nOur measured carbon abundances always exceed the\navailable high-resolution [N/Fe] abundances. If the origin of CNO abundance patterns comes from hot-bottomburning (HBB) in an intermediate mass (AGB) star, one\nwould expect to see elevated [N/Fe] relative to [C/Fe]\nand [O/Fe]. This signature is not found in our sample,\nbut it has been suggested that other mechanisms, such as\ncool-bottom-processing (Wasserburg et al. 1995; Denissenkov & VandenBerg 2003) or the occurrence of HIF,\ncan alter the levels of nitrogen enhancement.\nIt is likely that the majority of CEMP stars in this sample will turn out to be enhanced in neutron-capture elements. Consistency of most of our program stars with the\nCEMP-s class, based both on comparison to AGB models and existing high-resolution data, is expected since\nthat CEMP stars with s-process-element enhancement\nare the most commonly observed type to date. However, recent chemical evolution models (Cescutti & Chiappini 2010) have revealed that the winds from massive,\nrapidly-rotating metal-poor stars can result in a large\nscatter in the predicted abundances of C, N, and O, presumably without the production of neutron-capture elements. Therefore, we are currently unable to assign classification to this sample of CEMP stars. High-resolution\nspectra of the stars in our sample will help clarify these\nquestions.\n\nC.R.K. and T.C.B. acknowledge partial support for\nthis work from grants AST 07-07776, as well as from\nPHY 02-15783 and PHY 08-22648; Physics Frontier\nCenter/Joint Institute or Nuclear Astrophysics (JINA),\nawarded by the US National Science Foundation.

Each spectrum has Teff of 4500 K, log g of 1.0, [Fe/H] of \u22122.0, and [C/Fe]\nof +1.0.\n\n\f9\n\nFig. 2.- Each row shows four estimates of [O/H] for a star from our sample: HE 0111\u22121346, HE 0519\u22122053, HE 1207\u22123156, and\nHE 2339\u22120837, respectively. In each panel, the black lines are the data, the red lines are the best-fitting synthetic spectra, the green lines\nhave [O/H] values of 0.5 dex lower than the best-fitting spectra, and the blue lines have [O/H] values of 0.5 dex higher than the best-fitting\nspectra. A robust average of the four separate estimates is taken as the final estimate of oxygen abundance for each star. See text for\ndetails.\n\n\f10\n\nFig. 3.- Top panel: [O/Fe] vs. Teff for the entire sample. Middle panel: [O/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] for the entire sample.

The dashed line represents the fit for the carbon-normal stars from the\nSpite et al. (2005) sample of very metal-poor stars, while the solid line is the best fit for our data.\n\n\f12\n\nFig. 5.- [O/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] for the entire sample. The colored boxes show the regions occupied by different types of CEMP stars found\nin Masseron et al. (2010).\n\n\f13\n\nFig. 6.- C, N, and O abundances vs. metallicity for 10 stars from our sample. Also shown are linear fits for these species.\n\n\f14\n\nFig. 7.- Top panel: Predicted abundances of C, N, and O for model AGB stars of different masses (in M\u2299 ) from Herwig (2004).

The black square and red triangle mark the values of the abundances predicted by Herwig (2004) and the colored lines represent\nthe effects of dilution once the AGB material is accreted onto the observed CEMP star.
