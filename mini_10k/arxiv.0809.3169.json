A spine (or an edge-spine) is a set of edges\nthat intersects every nontrivial cycle. It is easy to see that there is a spine in G\u221e containing a\nfraction of O(d/m) of the edges. A recent result of Raz [7], motivated by the investigation of\nparallel repetition of the odd cycle game, can be used to show that there are much smaller spines\n\u221a\nconsisting of only a fraction of O( d/m) of the edges. Here we prove the following sharper version\nof this result.\nTheorem 1 There exists an edge-spine of G\u221e containing a fraction of at most 2\u03bc/(3d \u2212 1) =\np\n\u221a\nO( d/m) of the edges of G\u221e , where here \u03bc = 2 * (3d \u2212 1) * (3d \u2212 (1 + 2 cos(\u03c0/m))d ).\n\nIt is not difficult to see that the size of the smallest edge-spine in G1 is precisely dmd\u22121 . Indeed,\nthe set\n{ {(i1 , . . . , is\u22121 , 0, is+1 , . . . id ), (j1 , . . . , js\u22121 , 1, js+1 , . . . , jd )} : 1 \u2264 s \u2264 d, ir , jt \u2208 Cm }\n\nforms a spine, and there is no smaller spine as the set of all edges of G1 can be partitioned into\ndmd\u22121 pairwise edge disjoint nontrivial cycles .\nA vertex-spine is a set of vertices that intersects every nontrivial cycle. For vertex spines,\nthe smallest size is known for G\u221e and is not known for G1 . Indeed, improving a result of [8], it\nis proved in [3] that the size of the smallest vertex spine in G\u221e is md \u2212 (m \u2212 1)d , that is, the\nvertex-spine consisting of all vertices in which at least one coordinate is 0 is of minimum size. For\nG1 the situation is more complicated. It is easy to see that there is a vertex spine consisting of\nat most dmd\u22121 vertices. This has been improved in [3], where it is shown that there is a vertex\nspine of size at most dlog2 (3/2) md\u22121 \u2248 d0.6 md\u22121 . The following result improves this estimate.\n\u221a\nTheorem 2 There exists a vertex spine of G1 containing at most 2\u03c0 dmd\u22121 vertices.\n\u000e\nThe discrete results above have a continuous analogue studied in [5]. Let Td = Rd Zd be the\nd-dimensional unit torus. We write Vold and Vold\u22121 for the d-dimensional and (d \u2212 1)-dimensional\nHausdorff measures on the unit torus Td . A loop is a continuous image of the circle. A loop in\nTd is called contractible if it may be continuously deformed to a single point in Td . A spine in Td\nis a subset S \u2282 Td that intersects any non-contractible loop. Clearly, the set\nS = {(x1 , . . . , xd ) \u2208 [0, 1)d ; \u2203i \u2208 {1, . . . , d}, xi = 0}\nis a spine, with Vold\u22121 (S) = d. In [5] it is shown that we can find a much smaller spine.\n\u221a\nTheorem 3 ([5]) There exists a compact spine S \u2282 Td with Vold\u22121 (S) \u2264 2\u03c0 d.\nIn this paper we give relatively short proofs of the above three theorems. The crucial observation\nis that in all three cases one can apply either the isoperimetric inequality of Cheeger (see, e.g., [6]\nfor a short proof), or its discrete version for vertex boundary (proved in [1]) or for edge boundary\n(see, e.g., [2]), to obtain a substructure (an induced subgraph in the discrete case, and a body\n2\n\n\fin the continuous case) containing no nontrivial cycles, whose boundary is small with respect to\nits volume. The required spine is constructed in all cases by pieces of the boundaries of random\nshifts of this substructure. The proofs given here, while related to the ones given in [7] and [5],\nare significantly shorter. More importantly, they supply a clear explanation for the choice of\nthe functions whose level sets provide the required substructures, as these appear naturally as\neigenfunctions of the corresponding Laplace operators. Indeed, the proof in [5] also produces a\nspine by combining pieces of boundaries of random shifts of (several) level sets of an appropriate\nfunction, but provides no clear intuition to the choice of this function. It also estimates the\nboundary using a slightly more complicated argument than the one given here, and thus requires\na somewhat tedious computation. The proof in [7] uses a different function, yielding a slightly\nweaker conclusion. As we briefly remark, our approach can be applied to derive similar results for\nother examples of graphs and bodies.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nThe discrete case\nEdge spines\n\nWe start with a review of the discrete version of Cheeger's inequality with Dirichlet boundary\nconditions. For completeness, we include its proof.\nTheorem 4 Let G = (V, E) be a graph, where V = {1, . . . , n}, let A = (aij )i,j\u2208V be its adjacency\nmatrix and let Q = diag(d(i)i\u2208V )\u2212A be its Laplace matrix, where d(i) is the degree of i. Let U \u2282 V\nbe a set of vertices, and let x = (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ) be a vector assigning a value xi to vertex number\ni. Assume, further that xj = 0 for all j \u2208 U and that for every W \u2282 V \u2212 U , e(W, V \u2212 W ) \u2265 c|W |,\nwhere e(W, V \u2212 W ) is the number of edges joining a vertex of W with one of its complement.\nc2 P\n2\nThen xt Qx \u2265 2D\ni\u2208V xi , where D is the maximum degree of a vertex of G.\n\nProof: Without loss of generality assume that V \u2212 U = {1, 2, . . . , r} and that x21 \u2265 x22 . . . \u2265 x2r .\nP\nSince xt Qx = ij\u2208E (xi \u2212 xj )2 , by Cauchy Schwartz:\nX\nX\nX\nX\n(xi \u2212 xj )2 \u2265 [\n(x2i \u2212 x2j )]2 .\n2D(\nx2i ) * xt Qx \u2265\n(xi + xj )2\ni\u2208V\n\nij\u2208E\n\nij\u2208E\n\n(1)\n\nij\u2208E,i<j\n\nReplacing each term x2i \u2212x2j in the last expression by (x2i \u2212x2i+1 )+(x2i+1 \u2212x2i+2 )+* * *+(x2j\u22121 \u2212x2j ), the\nP\nexpression obtained from the sum S = ij\u2208E,i<j (x2i \u2212x2j ) contains each term of the form x2i \u2212x2i+1\nexactly e({1, 2, . . . , i}, {i + 1, . . . , n}) times, and by assumption this number is at least ci for all\nP\nP\ni \u2264 r. As xi = 0 for i > r this implies that S \u2265 i\u2264n ci(x2i \u2212 x2i+1 ) = c i\u2208V x2i (where, by\ndefinition, xn+1 = 0). Plugging in (1) the desired result follows. \u0003\nRemark: Note that the proof works even if we only assume that e(W, V \u2212 W ) \u2265 c|W | for every\nW which is a level set of the vector (x2i )i\u2208V , that is, for every W consisting of all vertices i with\nx2i \u2265 t.\n3\n\n\fLet Cm be, as before, the cycle of length m on the set of vertices M = {1, 2, . . . m} (in this order),\nd\nd)\nand let G\u221e = (Cm\n\u221e = (V, E) denote its d-(AND)-power. Note that G\u221e is D = 3 \u2212 1 regular.\nLemma 5 There exists a set W of vertices of G\u221e that contains no nontrivial cycles such that\n\u221a\ne(W, V \u2212 W ) \u2264 \u03bc|W |, where \u03bc is as in Theorem 1, and satisfies \u03bc/(3d \u2212 1) = O( d/m).\nProof: Let A = (aij )i,j\u2208M be the adjacency matrix of Cm , and let A\u2032 be the matrix obtained\nfrom it by replacing the last row and last column by the zero vector. Note that the adjacency\nmatrix of G\u221e is (I + A)\u2297d \u2212 I \u2297d , where for every matrix B, B \u2297d denotes the tensor product of\nd copies of B. Note also that if x is a vector of length m and xm = 0, and if x\u2297d is the tensor\nproduct of d copies of x, then\n(x\u2297d )t [(I + A)\u2297d \u2212 I \u2297d ]x\u2297d = (x\u2297d )t [(I + A\u2032 )\u2297d \u2212 I \u2297d ]x\u2297d ,\nsince these two matrices differ only in entries where the contribution to the quadratic form vanishes, as xm = 0.\nA simple computation shows that the vector x = sin(\u03c0j/m)j\u2208M (which satisfies xm = 0)\nis an eigenvector of A\u2032 with eigenvalue \u03bb = 2 cos(\u03c0/m). Therefore, x\u2297d is an eigenvector of\n(I + A\u2032 )\u2297d \u2212 I \u2297d with eigenvalue \u039b = (1 + \u03bb)d \u2212 1 = (1 + 2 cos(\u03c0/m))d \u2212 1.

The induced\nsubgraph on W contains no nontrivial cycle since W \u2282 (M \u2212 {m})d . \u0003\nProof of Theorem 1: Let W be as in Lemma 5, let v1 , v2 , . . . be a random sequence of vectors\nd , and define W = v + W = {v + w : w \u2208 W } where addition is taken modulo m in each\nin Zm\ni\ni\ni\ncoordinate. By symmetry, the induced subgraph of G\u221e on each Wi is isomorphic to that on W\nand hence contains no nontrivial cycle. Obviously, with probability 1 there exists a finite s so that\n\u222asi=1 Wi = V . For each i, let Ei be the set of all edges that connect a vertex of Wi \u2212 \u222aj<i Wj to\na vertex outside Wi . The union of all these sets Ei is clearly a spine, as each cycle that uses no\nedge of this union is contained in a single set Wi . We claim that the expected value of the random\nP\nvariable\n|Ei | is at most \u03bcmd . To see this, observe that by Lemma 5, if we choose a random\nvertex of W and a random edge incident with it, the probability that this edge leads to V \u2212 W\n|\nis at most (3d\u03bc|W\n= 3d\u03bc\u22121 . Fix a vertex v \u2208 M d , and let i be the smallest j so that v \u2208 Wj .\n\u22121)|W |\nConditioning on i being the smallest such j, v is a uniform random vertex of Wi , and hence if we\n4\n\n\fnow choose a random edge incident with it, the probability it leads to a vertex outside Wi is at\nmost 3d\u03bc\u22121 . It follows that the expected size of Ei is at most the expected size of Wi \u2212 \u222aj<i Wj\ntimes \u03bc. Summing over all values of i and using the fact that with probability 1 the union of all\nP\nsets Wi is V we conclude that the expected value of\n|Ei | is at most \u03bc|V | = \u03bcmd . Thus there\nis a choice of sets Wi so that the spine \u222ai Ei they provide is of size at most \u03bcmd , completing the\nproof. \u0003\n\n2.2\n\nVertex spines\n\nWe need the following version of the inequality of [1] with Dirichlet boundary condition. This is\nan analog of Theorem 4, dealing with vertex boundary instead of edge boundary. Its proof, which\nis based on the arguments in [1], is somewhat more complicated than that of Theorem 4.\nTheorem 6 Let G = (V, E) be a graph, where V = {1, . . . , n}, let A = (aij )i,j\u2208V be its adjacency\nmatrix and let Q = diag(d(i)i\u2208V )\u2212A be its Laplace matrix, where d(i) is the degree of i. Let U \u2282 V\nbe a set of vertices, and let x = (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ) be a vector assigning a value xi to vertex number\ni. Assume, further that xj = 0 for all j \u2208 U and that for every W \u2282 V \u2212 U , |N (W ) \u2212 W | \u2265 c|W |,\nc2 P\n2\nwhere N (W ) is the set of all vertices that have a neighbor in W . Then xt Qx \u2265 4+2c\n2\ni\u2208V xi .\n\nProof: Put Y = V \u2212U . We claim that there is an orientation E of E and a function h : E 7\u2192 [0, 1]\nP\nP\nso that the sum j,(i,j)\u2208E h(i, j) is at most 1 + c for all i \u2208 Y , the sum j,(j,i)\u2208E h(j, i) is at most\nP\nP\n1 for all i and the difference\nj,(i,j)\u2208E h(i, j) \u2212\nj,(j,i)\u2208E h(j, i) is at least c for every i \u2208 Y .\nTo prove this claim, consider the network flow problem in which the set of vertices consists of a\nsource s, a sink t, a set Y \u2032 consisting of a copy y \u2032 of every y \u2208 Y and a set V \" consisting of a\ncopy v\" of every vertex v \u2208 V . For each y \u2032 \u2208 Y \u2032 , (s, y \u2032 ) is an arc of the network with capacity\n1 + c, for each v\" \u2208 V \", (v\", t) is an arc of the network with capacity 1, and in addition, (u\u2032 , u\")\nis an arc of capacity 1 for each u \u2208 Y , and for each edge uv of G, with u \u2208 Y , v \u2208 V , the\narc (u\u2032 , v\") belongs to the network, and has capacity 1. (Note that if v is also in Y , then the\narc (v \u2032 , u\") is also in the network.) It is not difficult to check that the value of the maximum\nflow in this network is (1 + c)|Y |. Indeed, suppose we are given a cut and let X \u2286 Y be the set\nof all vertices y \u2208 Y such that (s, y \u2032 ) belongs to the cut. Then the cut must contain, for each\nv \u2208 (Y \u2212 X) \u222a N (Y \u2212 X), at least one arc incident with v\". As these arcs are pairwise distinct\nand there are at least (1 + c)|Y \u2212 X| of them, each having capacity 1, it follows that the total\ncapacity of the cut is at least (1 + c)|X| + (1 + c)|Y \u2212 X| = (1 + c)|Y |. By the Maxflow-Mincut\nTheorem there exists a flow of value at least (1 + c)|Y |, and this is clearly a maximum flow that\nsaturates all edges (s, y \u2032 ) with y \u2208 Y . If there is a positive flow in two arcs (i\u2032 , j\") and (j \u2032 , i\")\n(for some i, j \u2208 Y ), subtract the minimum of these two from both, to ensure that at least one of\nthese two quantities is zero, and subtract this minimum from the value of the flow on (s, i\u2032 ), (j\", t)\nand on (s, j \u2032 ), (i\", t), thus keeping it a valid flow without changing the value of the difference\nbetween the total flow leaving i\u2032 and the total flow going into i\". Let h\u2032 be the resulting flow. If\n5\n\n\fh\u2032 (i\u2032 , j\") > 0 for ij \u2208 E, orient the edge ij from i to j (in case h\u2032 (i\u2032 , j\") = h\u2032 (j \u2032 , i\") = 0 orient the\nedge arbitrarily). Finally, for each oriented edge (i, j), define h(i, j) = h\u2032 (i\u2032 , j\"). One can easily\ncheck that the function h satisfies the assertion of the claim.\nWe next note that the properties of h imply the following two inequalities.\nX\nX\nh2 (i, j)(xi + xj )2 \u2264 (4 + 2c2 )\nx2i .\n(2)\ni\n\n(i,j)\u2208E\n\nX\n\n(i,j)\u2208E\n\nh(i, j)(x2i \u2212 x2j ) \u2265 c\n\nX\n\nx2i .\n\n(3)\n\ni\n\nIndeed, (2) follows, as\nX\n\nh2 (i, j)(xi + xj )2 \u2264 2\n\nx2i (\n\nX\n\n(i,j)\u2208E\n\n=2\n\nX\ni\u2208Y\n\nh2 (i, j) +\n\nX\n\nX\n\n(i,j)\u2208E\n\nj,(j,i)\u2208E\n\nj,(i,j)\u2208E\n\nh2 (i, j)(x2i + x2j )\n\nh2 (j, i)) \u2264 2(2 + c2 )\n\nX\n\nx2i ,\n\ni\n\nwhere here we used the fact that xi = 0 for all i 6\u2208 Y and the fact that the sum of squares of\nreals in [0, 1] whose sum is at most (1 + c) does not exceed 1 + c2 (and the sum of squares of real\nnumbers in [0, 1] whose sum is at most 1 does not exceed 1).\nTo prove (3) note that\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nh(i, j)(x2i \u2212 x2j ) =\nx2i (\nh(i, j) \u2212\nh(j, i)) \u2265 c\nx2i .\n(i,j)\u2208E\n\ni\u2208Y\n\nj,(i,j)\u2208E\n\nj,(j,i)\u2208E\n\ni\n\nWe can now complete the proof of the theorem.

If the adjacency matrix of Cm is A, as before, then the one of G1 is the\nsum of d terms, each of which is a tensor product of d \u2212 1 copies of I and one copy of A. Thus,\nhere, too, we can use the vector x\u2297d , where x is as in Lemma 5, and prove the following.\nLemma 7 There exists a set of vertices W of G1 that contains no\u221anontrivial cycles so that its\n\u221a\n\u03c0\nc\n\u2264 4 d sin( 2m\n) \u2264 2\u03c0 md .\nvertex boundary in G1 is of size c|W |, and 1+c\n\n6\n\n\fProof: The Laplace matrix L of G1 and the vector x\u2297d above satisfy\n(x\u2297d )t Lx\u2297d\n\u03c0\n.\n= 2d \u2212 2d cos(\u03c0/m) = 4d sin2\n\u2297d\n2\n||x ||\n2m\nBy Theorem 6 this implies that there is a set of vertices W containing no vertices with any\nc2\n2 \u03c0\ncoordinate being m so that if |N (W ) \u2212 W | = c|W |, then 4+2c\n2 \u2264 4d sin 2m .

Let W be as in Lemma 7,\nd , and define W = v + W = {v + w : w \u2208 W }\nlet v1 , v2 , . . . be a random sequence of vectors in Zm\ni\ni\ni\nwhere addition is taken modulo m in each coordinate. By symmetry, the induced subgraph of\nG1 on each Wi is isomorphic to that on W and hence contains no nontrivial cycle. Obviously,\nwith probability 1 there exists a finite s so that the union \u222asi=1 (Wi \u222a N (Wi )) covers all vertices\nof G1 . For each i, define Bi = (N (Wi ) \u2212 Wi ) \u2212 \u222aj<i (Wj \u222a N (Wj )). The union of all the sets Bi\nis a vertex spine, as each cycle that uses no vertex of this union is contained in a single set Wi .\nWe claim that for each fixed vertex v of G1 , the probability that v belongs to the above union\nc\n. Indeed, if i is the smallest j so that v \u2208 (Wj \u222a N (Wj )), v is a uniform random vertex of\nis 1+c\nWi \u222a N (Wi ) and the probability that it lies in N (Wi ) \u2212 Wi is thus precisely c/(1 + c), as claimed.\nc\nBy linearity of expectation, the expected size of the union of all sets Bi is 1+c\nmd , and the desired\nresult follows. \u0003\nRemarks:\n\u2022 A simple computation shows that for large m and d, the expression\nq \u221a\nmost (1 + o(1)) 83 \u03c0md .\n\n2\u03bc\n3d \u22121\n\nin Theorem 1 is at\n\n\u2022 By the remark following the proof of Theorem 4, the set W in Lemma 5 is a level set of the\nvector x\u2297d (or equivalently, the vector obtained from it by squaring each coordinate.)\n\u2022 Theorem 1 gives an alternative proof of the main result of Raz [7], showing that in the\nparallel repetition for the maxcut game on an odd cycle, \u0398(m2 ) repetitions are required to\nensure a value smaller than 1/2.\n\u2022 The assertion of Theorems 1 and 2 can be extended to powers of other Cayley graphs.\n\n3\n\nThe continuous case\n\nThe discrete results above have a continuous analogue.

Recall that we write Vold and Vold\u22121 for the d-dimensional and\n(d \u2212 1)-dimensional Hausdorff measures on the unit torus Td . A body here means a non-empty\ncompact set that equals the closure of its interior. A smooth function or surface always means\nhere C \u221e -smooth.\nLemma 8 There exists a body D \u2282 (0, 1)d \u2282 Td with a smooth boundary, such that\n\u221a\nVold\u22121 (\u2202D) \u2264 2\u03c0 dVold (D).\n\nProof: Denote\nh=\n\ninf\n\nA\u2282(0,1)d\n\nVold\u22121 (\u2202A)\nVold (A)\n\n(4)\n\nwhere the infimum runs over all bodies A with a smooth boundary in (0, 1)d .

For a short proof of Cheeger's inequality, see, e.g., [6], Chapter III.\nQ\nThe best function to substitute in (5) is the Laplacian eigenfunction \u03c6(x) = di=1 sin(\u03c0xi ), which\nsatisfies \u25b3\u03c6 = \u2212d\u03c0 2 \u03c6. From (5) we thus learn that d\u03c0 2 \u2264 h2 /4, and the lemma follows. \u0003\nRemark. The set D \u2282 (0, 1)d in Lemma 8 may be chosen to be convex. In fact, as the proof\nof Cheeger's inequality shows, the set D may be chosen to be a level set of the concave function\nP\nlog \u03c6(x) = di=1 log sin(\u03c0xi ).\n\nProof of Theorem 3: Let v1 , v2 , . . . \u2208 Td be a sequence of independent random vectors, uniformly distributed in the torus Td . Let D stand for the body from Lemma 8, and write Di = vi +D,\nwhere addition is carried in the group Td . Consider the disjoint union\nS=\n\n\u221e\n[\n\nSi ,\n\nSi = \u2202Di \\ \u222ai\u22121\nj=1 Dj .\n\nwhere\n\ni=1\n\nSince D has a non-empty interior, then with probability one, Td is the union of finitely many Dj 's.\nThus, if a loop in Td does not intersect S, it must be contained in Di \u2282 vi + (0, 1)d for some i,\nand hence it is contractible. Consequently, S is a compact spine with probability one. It remains\n\u221a\nto show that EVold\u22121 (S) \u2264 2\u03c0 d. Note that S is a finite union of Si 's, and each Si is a relatively\nopen subset of the smooth hypersurface \u2202Di .

The proof is complete. \u0003\nRemarks:\n\u2022 A spine S \u2282 Td is called regular if it is contained in a finite union of smooth hypersurfaces\nin Td . A spine S \u2282 Td is minimal if for any x \u2208 S and \u03b5 > 0, the set S \\ B(x, \u03b5) is no\nlonger a spine, where B(x, \u03b5) is the open ball of radius \u03b5 about x. By Zorn's lemma, for\nany compact spine S there exists a minimal sub-spine S \u2032 \u2282 S. We may thus assume that\nthe spine S in Theorem 3 is minimal and regular. When S is a minimal regular spine, the\nset Td \\ S is necessarily connected, and since it intersects all non-contractible loops, it is\nsimply-connected. Note that for a minimal spine S, the set S\u0304 = {x \u2208 Rd ; x mod Zd \u2208 S} is\nthe boundary of a Zd -periodic tiling of Rd with connected cells of volume one.\n\u2022 Theorem 3 is tight, up to the value of the constant 2\u03c0. Indeed, suppose S \u2282 Td is a minimal\nspine. Consider the set S\u0304 = {x \u2208 Rd ; x mod Zd \u2208 S}, and pick a connected component C\nof Rd \\ S\u0304. Then Vold (C) = 1 and Vold\u22121 (\u2202C) = 2Vold\u22121 (S). By the classical isoperimetric\ninequality in Rd ,\nVold\u22121 (S) = Vold\u22121 (\u2202C)/2 \u2265 \u03bad Vold (C)(d\u22121)/d /2 = \u03bad /2\n\n\u221a \u221a\n\u0001\n\u221a\nwhere \u03bad = d \u03c0\u0393(1 + d/2)\u22121/d \u2265 d 2\u03c0e + o(1) .\n\n\u2022 Our proof uses very few properties of the torus. A straightforward generalization of Theorem\n3 might read as follows: Suppose a Lie group G acts transitively by isometries on a simplyconnected Riemannian manifold \u03a9 (in our case G = \u03a9 = Rd ). Let \u0393 be a discrete, cocompact subgroup (in our case \u0393 = Zd ), and let T \u2282 \u03a9 be a fundamental domain (in\n9\n\n\four case T = [0, 1)d ). Assume that T is simply connected, and write \u03bb for the minimal\neigenvalue of minus the Laplacian with Dirichlet boundary conditions on T . Then, there\n\u221a\nexists a compact spine in \u03a9/\u0393 whose surface area is at most 2 \u03bb.\nNote that there clearly exists a trivial spine in \u03a9/\u0393 whose area is at most Vold\u22121 (\u2202T ). Only\n\u221a\nin the case where \u03bb << Vold\u22121 (\u2202T ) we obtain a non-trivial conclusion.\n\u2022 A short argument leading from the continuous Theorem 3 to the discrete Theorem 1 (with\na slightly worse constant) appears in [4], Theorem 3.1.\nAcknowledgment: We thank Guy Kindler, Anup Rao and Avi Wigderson for helpful comments.\n\nReferences\n[1] N.
