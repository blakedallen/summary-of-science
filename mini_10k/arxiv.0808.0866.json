In this paper we provide examples of topological dynamical systems having either finite or countable scrambled sets. In particular we study\nconditions for the existence of Li-Yorke, asymptotic and distal pairs in constant\u2013length substitution dynamical systems. Starting from a circle rotation\nwe also construct a dynamical system having Li\u2013Yorke pairs, none of which is\nrecurrent.\n\n1. Introduction\nOne definition of topological chaos, based on ideas in [LY], emerged twenty\u2013five\nyears ago. It is not the only definition of chaos by far. It relies on the existence\nof uncountable 'scrambled' subsets. Here we investigate what might be called 'the\nedge of Li\u2013Yorke chaos': we give examples of systems having only finite or countable\nscrambled subsets. In particular those are examples of transitive dynamical systems\nof zero topological entropy which are not Li\u2013Yorke chaotic.\nLet (X, T ) be a topological dynamical system: X is a compact metric space with\nmetric \u033a, and T is a surjective continuous map from X to itself. A pair of points\n{x, y} \u2286 X is said to be a Li\u2013Yorke pair if one has simultaneously\nlim sup \u033a(T n x, T n y) > 0 and lim inf \u033a(T n x, T n y) = 0.\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nA set S \u2286 X is called scrambled if any pair of distinct points {x, y} \u2286 S is a Li\u2013\nYorke pair. Finally, a system (X, T ) is called chaotic in the sense of Li and Yorke\nif X contains an uncountable scrambled set. Li\u2013Yorke chaos has been recently\nproved to result from various dynamical properties: positive entropy; 2\u2013scattering;\ntransitivity together with one periodic orbit (see [BGKM] and [HY]). The opposite\nsituation exists too: equicontinuous and distal systems have no Li\u2013Yorke pairs.\nThe aim of this article is to describe various systems that are not Li\u2013Yorke chaotic\nwhile having Li\u2013Yorke pairs. Most of them arise from constant-length substitutions,\nwhich are the most classical topological extensions of odometers.\nA pair {x, y} \u2286 X is called distal if lim inf n\u2192\u221e \u033a(T n x, T n y) > 0. If, instead,\nlim inf n\u2192\u221e \u033a(T n x, T n y) = 0 then the pair is called proximal. If the limit exists\nand is equal to zero then the pair is called asymptotic. Thus {x, y} is a Li\u2013Yorke\npair if and only if it is proximal but not asymptotic. The sets of distal, proximal\nand asymptotic pairs of (X, T ) are denoted by D(X, T ), P(X, T ) and A(X, T )\nrespectively. Clearly the set of Li\u2013Yorke pairs is LY(X, T ) = P(X, T ) \\ A(X, T ).\nThe sets of distal pairs, Li\u2013Yorke pairs and asymptotic pairs partition X 2 . It is\neasy to see that the image of a proximal (asymptotic) pair under a factor map is\n1991 Mathematics Subject Classification.

Observe that in all these definitions the order of a pair\nis irrelevant: a non\u2013diagonal pair may be considered as a subset of cardinality 2.\nFinally we point out that even if definitions of distal, proximal, asymptotic and\nLi-Yorke pairs work for any general dynamical system (X, T ), in the examples that\nwill follow we essentially look to the case where T is a homeomorphism.\nA dynamical system (X, T ) is called minimal if the unique closed invariant subsets\nof X are X and \u2205. A distal dynamical system is one in which every non\u2013diagonal\npair is distal. A dynamical system having no Li\u2013Yorke pairs is called almost distal\n[BGKM]; Sturmian systems and the Morse system are elementary examples. In\n[AA] Akin and Auslander introduce strong Li\u2013Yorke pairs, i.e., those Li\u2013Yorke\npairs that are recurrent under T \u00d7 T . They call semi\u2013distal a system without\nstrong Li\u2013Yorke pairs. Distal, almost distal and semi\u2013distal systems are minimal\nwhen transitive. A system described some time ago by Floyd ([Au], p. 26) was\nrecently remarked to be semi\u2013distal but not almost distal ([Y], [AA]); it is an\nextension of an adding machine in which fibers are intervals or singletons. Here\nwe give several examples with the same property, one comes from a substitution\nof constant length and the other is a bounded\u2013to\u2013one extension of an irrational\nrotation.\nIn Section 3 we study distal, asymptotic and Li\u2013Yorke pairs in systems generated\nby constant\u2013length substitutions; this study turns out to be complete when the\nalphabet has size 2. This yields examples of systems in which scrambled sets have\nany given finite cardinality. The following section is devoted to the construction of\nan inverse limit of substitution systems having the property that all scrambled sets\nare at most countable. Finally in Section 5 we construct a new semi\u2013distal, not\nalmost distal, system.\n\n2. Preliminaries about substitutions\n2.1. General facts about substitutions. A substitution is a map \u03c4 : A \u2192 A+ ,\nwhere A is a finite set and A+ is the set of finite sequences with values in A; \u03c4 is\na substitution of constant length p, p \u2265 2, if |\u03c4 (a)| = p for any a \u2208 A, where | * |\ndenotes the length of a word.\nIn the sequel N stands for the set of non-negative integers. The sets of one\u2013sided\nand two\u2013sided infinite sequences are denoted by AN and AZ respectively. If K = N\nor Z, points of AK are denoted by (xi )i\u2208K and given i, j \u2208 K, i \u2264 j, x(i, j) denotes\nthe word (or sub\u2013word) xi ...xj of x; by convention x(i, i) = xi . For a word w \u2208 A+\nif |w| = n we put w = w0 ...wn\u22121 and w(i, j) = wi ...wj for 0 \u2264 i \u2264 j < n. The shift\nmap T : AK \u2192 AK is the continuous map defined by T ((xi )i\u2208K ) = (xi+1 )i\u2208K . A\nsubshift X is a closed T -invariant subset of AN or AZ ; the action we consider on\nX will always be the restriction of the shift map to X and will also be denoted by\nT . In this paper we will look exclusively at the case where K = Z; in this case T\nis a homeomorphism. We say that a word appears in a subshift or is a sub\u2013word\nof a subshift if it is a sub\u2013word of a point of the subshift. A subshift is completely\ndetermined by the list of all words that never occur as sub\u2013words of its points.\nThe substitution \u03c4 can be naturally extended by concatenation to A+ , AN and AZ ;\nfor x = (xi )i\u2208Z \u2208 AZ the extension is given by\n\u03c4 (x) = ...\u03c4 (x\u22122 )\u03c4 (x\u22121 ).\u03c4 (x0 )\u03c4 (x1 )...\n\n\fFran\u00e7ois Blanchard, Fabien Durand, Alejandro Maass\n\n3\n\nwhere the central dot separates negative and non-negative coordinates of \u03c4 (x). A\nfurther natural convention is that the image of the empty word \u03b5 is \u03b5. We say that\n\u03c4 is primitive if there is n \u2208 N such that a appears in \u03c4 n (b) for every a, b \u2208 A.\nThe substitution \u03c4 generates a subshift X\u03c4 of AZ which is the smallest subshift of\nAZ admitting all words {\u03c4 n (a) : n \u2208 N, a \u2208 A}; when \u03c4 is primitive the subshift it\ngenerates is minimal. For more details and complements about this subsection we\nrefer the reader to [Q]. To end this subsection we recall the following result due to\nB. Moss\u00e9 [Mo] (see also [MS]).\nTheorem 2.1. Let \u03c4 be a primitive substitution. Suppose X\u03c4 is infinite. Then,\n\u03c4 : X\u03c4 \u2192 \u03c4 (X\u03c4 ) is a one-to-one continuous map. If \u03c4 is of constant length p, then\nT p \u25e6 \u03c4 = \u03c4 \u25e6 T and \u03c4 (X\u03c4 ) is a proper p-periodic subset of X\u03c4 , that is, {T i (\u03c4 (X\u03c4 )) :\ni \u2208 {0, ..., p \u2212 1}} is a clopen (closed and open) partition of X\u03c4 .\nIn the case where \u03c4 is of constant length p the partition {T i (\u03c4 (X\u03c4 )) : i \u2208 {0, ..., p \u2212\n1}} will be called the fundamental partition of X\u03c4 .\nLet \u03c4 be a primitive substitution. Let us now recall a way to prove that X\u03c4 is infinite\nor not. J.-J. Pansiot [Pa], and, T. Harju and M. Linna [HL] proved (in our settings)\nthat it is decidable whether X\u03c4 is infinite or not. We need some definitions. Let\nL(\u03c4 ) be the set of finite words having an occurrence in some x \u2208 X\u03c4 . We say a word\nu \u2208 L(X\u03c4 ) is biprolongeable (with respect to X\u03c4 ) if there exist two distinct letters\na and b such that ua and ub belong to L(X\u03c4 ). We say \u03c4 : A \u2192 A+ is simplifiable if\nthere exist an alphabet B, |B| < |A|, and two morphisms f : A\u2217 \u2192 B \u2217 , g : B \u2217 \u2192 A\u2217\nsuch that \u03c4 = g \u25e6 f . The substitution \u03c4 is elementary if it is not simplifiable. Note\nthat when |A| = 2, \u03c4 is simplifiable if and only if there exist u \u2208 A+ , n, m \u2208 N such\nthat \u03c4 (A) = {un , um }.\nProposition 2.2. [Pa] Let \u03c4 : A \u2192 A+ be an elementary primitive substitution.\nThen, X\u03c4 is infinite if and only if there exists at least one biprolongeable letter\na \u2208 A.\nIf \u03c4 is not elementary then there exist an alphabet B, |B| < |A|, and two morphisms\nf : A\u2217 \u2192 B \u2217 , g : B \u2217 \u2192 A\u2217 such that \u03c4 = g \u25e6 f . Let \u03b3 = f \u25e6 g. We can remark that\nX\u03b3 is infinite if and only if X\u03c4 is infinite.\nIf \u03b3 is elementary we apply Proposition 2.2 to know if X\u03c4 is infinite. Otherwise we\ncontinue the induction. It will stop because the sequence of the cardinality of the\nalphabets we produce is decreasing and because when |A| = 1, X\u03c4 is finite.\n2.2. One\u2013to\u2013one reduction of substitutions. It is often very convenient to\nassume that a substitution is one\u2013to\u2013one. Here we show that this can be done\nwithout any serious loss of generality.\nLet \u03c4 : A \u2192 A+ be a substitution, and let B \u2282 A be such that for any a \u2208 A there\nis a unique b \u2208 B for which \u03c4 (a) = \u03c4 (b). We define the onto map \u03c6 : A \u2192 B by\n\u03c6(a) = b if \u03c4 (a) = \u03c4 (b). We call \u03c4\u0304 : B \u2192 B + the unique substitution satisfying\n\u03c4\u0304 \u25e6 \u03c6 = \u03c6 \u25e6 \u03c4 . If \u03c4 is primitive then \u03c4\u0304 is primitive too. We say \u03c4\u0304 is a reduction of\n\u03c4 . The map \u03c6 defines a topological factor from (X\u03c4 , T ) onto (X\u03c4\u0304 , T ), also called \u03c6.\nOne checks that \u03c4 (\u03c6(a)) = \u03c4 (a) for all a \u2208 A; thus \u03c4 (\u03c6(x)) = \u03c4 (x) for all x \u2208 X\u03c4 .\nProposition 2.3. Let \u03c4 : A \u2192 A+ be a primitive substitution. The set X\u03c4 is finite\nif and only if X\u03c4\u0304 is finite. Moreover, if X\u03c4 is not finite then X\u03c4 is topologically\nconjugate to X\u03c4\u0304 .\n\n\f4\n\nConstant-length substitutions and countable scrambled sets\n\nProof. If X\u03c4 is finite X\u03c4\u0304 is finite too. On the other hand if X\u03c4\u0304 is finite all its\npoints are periodic for the shift. Therefore \u03c6(x) is periodic and \u03c4 (x) = \u03c4 (\u03c6(x))\ntoo for x \u2208 X\u03c4 . Since X\u03c4 is minimal and \u03c4 (x) \u2208 X\u03c4 one concludes that X\u03c4 is\nfinite. Suppose X\u03c4 is not finite. Since \u03c6 is a factor map we only need to prove \u03c6 is\none\u2013to\u2013one. If \u03c6(x) = \u03c6(y), x, y \u2208 X\u03c4 , then \u03c4 (x) = \u03c4 (\u03c6(x)) = \u03c4 (\u03c6(y)) = \u03c4 (y). But\nin this case \u03c4 : X\u03c4 \u2192 \u03c4 (X\u03c4 ) is one\u2013to\u2013one (Theorem 2.1) and x = y. Therefore \u03c6\nis a topological conjugacy.\n\u0003\nRemark that if X\u03c4 is finite then (X\u03c4 , T ) is not conjugate to (X\u03c4\u0304 , T ). For example\ntake \u03c4 : {0, 1} \u2192 {0, 1}+, \u03c4 (0) = \u03c4 (1) = 01. A substitution \u03c4 : A \u2192 A+ is said to\nbe one\u2013to\u2013one if for all a, b \u2208 A, a 6= b, \u03c4 (a) 6= \u03c4 (b); \u03c4 is one\u2013to\u2013one if and only if\n|B| = |A|. In this case \u03c4 and \u03c4\u0304 are the same. If \u03c4 is not one\u2013to\u2013one then |B| < |A|.\nBy repeating the reduction described above finitely many times we obtain a one\u2013\nto\u2013one substitution \u03c3 : C \u2192 C + and a factor map \u03c8 : (X\u03c4 , T ) \u2192 (X\u03c3 , T ), which\nis a conjugacy when X\u03c4 is not finite. The substitution \u03c3 is called the one\u2013to\u2013\none reduction of \u03c4 (since it is uniquely defined up to the rename of letters in the\nalphabet).\nNote that when X\u03c4 is finite, the one-to-one reduction can be defined on an alphabet\nwhich is not a singleton. It is the case for \u03c4 : {0, 1} \u2192 {0, 1}+ defined by \u03c4 (0) = 010\nand \u03c4 (1) = 101 where X\u03c4 is an orbit of period two.\n2.3. Constant-length substitutions and odometers. Let p \u2265 2 be an integer.\nThe inverse limit Op of the sequence of groups (Z/pk Z : k \u2208 N) endowed with the\naddition of 1 is called the p\u2013odometer; OP is a compact topological ring. Odometers\nare always minimal and uniquely ergodic. The p\u2013odometer will be denoted by\n(Op , T0 ). With [p] P\n= {0, ..., p\u2212 1} there is a natural homeomorphism np : [p]N \u2192 Op\nsuch that np (\u03b4) = i\u22650 \u03b4i pi for \u03b4 = (\u03b4i )i\u2208N \u2208 [p]N . The sequence \u03b4 is the expansion\nin base p of number np (\u03b4). Through this homeomorphism we will identify [p]N\nwith Op . The integers can be identified with the integer multiples of the identity,\nand so, we can think in Z as a dense subring of Op . A number in Op is positive\n(respectively negative) integer if and only if its expansion sequence is eventually 0\n(resp. eventually p \u2212 1). For addition in Op you add the digits modulo p but with\nthe carry to the right. The projection to Zpk is given by the list of the first k digits.\nLet \u03c4 : A \u2192 A+ be a primitive substitution of constant length p such that X\u03c4 is\nnot finite. The p\u2013odometer is a factor of the subshift X\u03c4 . The proof of this fact is\nbased on the following central result of the theory of substitutions.\nTheorem 2.4 ([De], [Mo]). Let \u03c4\nfinite. Then for any x \u2208 X\u03c4 there\nand a unique sequence of positive\n\u03c4 (x(i) ) = T \u2212\u03b4i\u22121 (x(i\u22121) ), i \u2265 1.\n\u03c0(x) = (\u03b4i )i\u2208N is continuous.\n\nbe a primitive substitution such that X\u03c4 is not\nare a unique sequence of points (x(i) )i\u2208N \u2286 X\u03c4\nintegers (\u03b4i )i\u2208N \u2286 [p] such that x(0) = x and\nMoreover, the map \u03c0 : X\u03c4 \u2192 [p]N defined by\n\nProof. We sketch part of the proof. The fundamental partition is naturally indexed\nby [p], that is, to j \u2208 [p] we associate T j (\u03c4 (X\u03c4 )). The point x = x(0) lies in a unique\nmember of the partition with index \u03b40 . Pull back by T \u03b40 to get an element of \u03c4 (X\u03c4 ).\nThen apply \u03c4 \u22121 to obtain the element x(1) . Continue inductively.\n\u0003\nFor i \u2208 N and x \u2208 X\u03c4 put pi (x) = x(i) (\u2212\u03b4i , \u22121) and si (x) = x(i) (1, p \u2212 1 \u2212 \u03b4i ). If\n\u03b4i = p \u2212 1 we put si (x) to be the empty word. Analogously if \u03b4i = 0 let pi (x) be\n\n\fFran\u00e7ois Blanchard, Fabien Durand, Alejandro Maass\n\n5\n\nthe empty word. From Theorem 2.4, for all i \u2265 0 one has\n(i+1)\n\n(2.1)\n\n\u03c4 (x0\n\n(i)\n\n) = pi (x)x0 si (x)\n\nand\n|pi (T x)| = 0\n|pi (T x)| = |pi (x)| + 1\n|pi (T x)| = |pi (x)|\n\n(2.2)\n\nif i < i\u2217 ,\nif i = i\u2217 ,\nif i > i\u2217 ,\n\nwhere i\u2217 = inf{i \u2208 N : \u03b4i 6= p \u2212 1}. Set I \u2212 (x) = {i \u2208 N : |pi (x)| 6= 0} and\nI + (x) = {i \u2208 N : |si (x)| 6= 0}. By definition if \u03c0(x) = \u03c0(y) then I \u2212 (x) = I \u2212 (y)\nand I + (x) = I + (y).\nWe will frequently look at pairs (x, y) such that \u03c0(x) = \u03c0(y). Two such points\nhave a common expansion in base p sequence (\u03b4i )i\u2208N . In particular it follows that\n|pi (x)| = |pi (y)|, |si (x)| = |si (y)|, i \u2208 N, and I \u00b1 (x) = I \u00b1 (y). In this case we will let\nI = I + (x) = I + (y) or I = I \u2212 (x) = I \u2212 (y). While the definitions are symmetric,\nwe are interested in long-term positive time behavior and so our attention will focus\non I + and si .\nLemma 2.5. Let x \u2208 X\u03c4 .

This follows inductively from the definition of (x(i) )i\u2208N and (\u03b4i )i\u2208N .\n\u2212\n\n2\n\ni\n\n\u2212\n\n\u0003\n+\n\nDefine k (x) = max{|\u03c4 (pi (x))...\u03c4 (p2 (x))\u03c4 (p1 (x))p0 (x)| : i \u2208 I (x)} and k (x) =\nmax{|x0 s0 (x)\u03c4 (s1 (x))\u03c4 2 (s2 (x))...\u03c4 i (si (x))| : i \u2208 I + (x)}. Observe that k \u2212 (*) and\nk + (*) are constants on fibers of \u03c0. Also k + (x) is finite when I + (x) is a finite\nset which is when the expansion in base p of \u03c0(x) is a negative integer in Op .\nFurthermore, if |I + (x)| < \u221e there is j0 \u2208 N such that \u03b4j = p \u2212 1 for j \u2265 j0 .\n+\nTherefore |sj (T k (x) (x))| = p \u2212 1 for j \u2265 0 and\n(2.3)\n\nx(0, \u221e) = x(0, k \u2212 1)x(k)s0 (T k (x))\u03c4 (s1 (T k (x)))\u03c4 2 (s2 (T k (x)))...\n(m)\n= x(0, k \u2212 1) limm\u2192\u221e \u03c4 m (x1 ),\n\nwhere k = k + (x). Analogously if |I \u2212 (x)| < \u221e for all j \u2265 j0 , \u03b4j = 0 and\n(2.4)\n\nx(\u2212\u221e, 0) = ...\u03c4 (p1 (T \u2212k\u22121 (x)))p0 (T \u2212k\u22121 (x))x(\u2212k \u2212 1)x(\u2212k, 0)\n(m)\n= limm\u2192\u221e \u03c4 m (x\u22121 )x(\u2212k, 0),\n\nwhere k = k \u2212 (x).

The map \u03c0 : (X\u03c4 , T ) \u2192 (Op , T0 ) is a factor map such that for every\n\u03b4 \u2208 Op , |\u03c0 \u22121 ({\u03b4})| < K, where K = |{words of length 3 of X\u03c4 }|.\nProof. It is clear by (2.2) that T0 \u25e6 \u03c0 = \u03c0 \u25e6 T , and \u03c0 is continuous by Theorem 2.4. Therefore, since (X\u03c4 , T ) is minimal, (\u03c0(X\u03c4 ), T0 ) is a minimal system\nand \u03c0(X\u03c4 ) = Op . This proves that \u03c0 defines a factor map. Let \u03b4 = (\u03b4i )i\u2208N \u2208\nOp and suppose |\u03c0 \u22121 ({\u03b4})| \u2265 K + 1. By Theorem 2.4 and Lemma 2.5, for\nall x \u2208 \u03c0 \u22121 ({\u03b4}) there exists a unique sequence of points (x(n) )n\u22651 such that\nn\nx = T (\u03b40 +p\u03b41 +***+p \u03b4n ) \u03c4 n+1 (x(n+1) ) for all n \u2208 N. Let E = {x1 , x2 , . . . , xK+1 } \u2282\n\u03c0 \u22121 ({\u03b4}). Since |E| > K, for all n \u2265 1 there exists z1 6= z2 \u2208 E such that\n(n)\n(n)\nz1 (\u22121, 1) = z2 (\u22121, 1) \u2208 A3 . Then as E is finite there are x 6= y \u2208 E and a\nstrictly increasing sequence of integers (ni )i\u2208N such that x(ni ) (\u22121, 1) = y (ni ) (\u22121, 1)\nfor all i \u2208 N. Consequently x and y belong to\nni \u22121\n\nT (\u03b40 +p\u03b41 +***+p\n\n\u03b4ni \u22121 ) ni\n\n(n )\n\n(ni ) (ni )\nx1 ].\n\n\u03c4 [x\u22121i .x0\n\nLemma 2.6 implies that x = y, which contradicts the choice of x and y. Thus\n|\u03c0 \u22121 ({\u03b4})| \u2264 K.\n\u0003\n3. Li-Yorke pairs of constant\u2013length substitution systems\nLet \u03c4 : A \u2192 A+ be a primitive substitution of constant length p \u2265 2 such that\nX\u03c4 is not finite. The odometer is a distal system (actually an isometry); whenever\nx, y \u2208 X\u03c4 and \u03c0(x) 6= \u03c0(y) one has (x, y) \u2208 D(X\u03c4 , T ), where \u03c0 is the factor\nmap defined in Theorem 2.4. This implies that all Li\u2013Yorke pairs of (X\u03c4 , T ), and\nconsequently all scrambled sets, are contained in fibres \u03c0 \u22121 ({\u03b4}), \u03b4 \u2208 Op . Then\nby Lemma 2.7 all scrambled sets have finite cardinality. For the same reason an\nasymptotic pair is included in one fiber.\nA direct consequence of Proposition 2.3 is the following corollary.\nCorollary 3.1. Let \u03c4 : A \u2192 A+ be a primitive substitution of constant length\np \u2265 2; let \u03c3 be its one-to-one reduction and \u03c8 be the corresponding map. If X\u03c4 is\nnot finite\n(1) \u03c8 \u00d7 \u03c8(A(X\u03c4 , T )) = A(X\u03c3 , T ),\n(2) \u03c8 \u00d7 \u03c8(LY(X\u03c4 , T )) = LY(X\u03c3 , T ),\n(3) \u03c8 \u00d7 \u03c8(D(X\u03c4 , T )) = D(X\u03c3 , T ).\n(4) \u03c8 \u00d7 \u03c8(P(X\u03c4 , T )) = P(X\u03c3 , T ).\nAlso, \u03c8 maps \u03c4 to \u03c3.\nTherefore to study asymptotic, proximal, distal and Li\u2013Yorke pairs of (X\u03c4 , T ) it is\nenough to consider the one\u2013to\u2013one reduced system (X\u03c3 , T ).\nDefinition 3.2.\n(1) Let u, u\u2032 \u2208 A+ be two words of the same length. We say\nthey have a coincidence if ui = u\u2032i for some coordinate i \u2208 {0, ..., |u| \u2212 1}.\nAll i \u2208 {0, ..., |u| \u2212 1} such that ui 6= u\u2032i are called non\u2013coincidences.\n(2) Let \u03c4 : A \u2192 A+ be a substitution of constant length p. We say that \u03c4 has\na coincidence if there are a, b \u2208 A, a 6= b, such that \u03c4 (a) and \u03c4 (b) have a\ncoincidence. We say it has overall coincidences if the last property holds for\nany a, b \u2208 A. We say it has partial coincidence if there exist coincidences\nbut no overall coincidences.\n\n\fFran\u00e7ois Blanchard, Fabien Durand, Alejandro Maass\n\n7\n\nWhen A = {0, 1} and \u03c4 has coincidences, then it has overall coincidences.\nProposition 3.3. Let \u03c4 be a primitive substitution and assume X\u03c4 is infinite. If \u03c4\nhas overall coincidences then each pair {x, y}, x 6= y, with \u03c0(x) = \u03c0(y) is proximal.\nProof. Let {x, y}, x 6= y, be a pair such that \u03c0(x) = \u03c0(y). Shift so as to have I\ninfinite. Applying Lemma 2.5 we see the lengths of the si agree. A coincidence\noccurs within \u03c4 (si (x)) and \u03c4 (si (y)) whenever \u03b4i 6= p \u2212 1. Thus, there is a common\nblock of length pi\u22121 between \u03c4 i (si (x)) and \u03c4 i (si (y)).\n\u0003\nIn the case of the previous proposition, the Li-Yorke pairs are exactly those pairs\nin a fiber which are not asymptotic.\nIt is well known that any infinite subshift has non\u2013trivial asymptotic pairs. Moreover, it has been proved in [Q] that the number of different orbits of asymptotic\npairs in the Cartesian product is finite (see also [HZ]). This property is also true\nfor any infinite subshift with sub\u2013affine symbolic complexity. In [BDH] the authors\ngive an upper bound for the number of different orbits of asymptotic pairs for substitution subshifts. In the next propositions we show how asymptotic and Li\u2013Yorke\npairs arise in our substitution systems.\nProposition 3.4. Let \u03c4 : A \u2192 A+ be a one\u2013to\u2013one primitive substitution of\nconstant length p such that X\u03c4 is not finite. Let {x, y} be a pair such that \u03c0(x) =\n\u03c0(y) and let I = I + (x) = I + (y) and k = k + (x) = k + (y). Then\n(1) (x, y) \u2208 A(X\u03c4 , T ) if and only if either I is infinite and si (x) = si (y) for\nall sufficiently large i, or, I is finite and si (T k (x)) = si (T k (y)) for all\nsufficiently large i.\n(2) Assume that \u03c4 has no coincidences. If there exists i \u2208 Z such that xi 6=\nyi and |I + (T i (x))| = \u221e then it is a distal pair. Otherwise the pair is\nasymptotic. Anyway LY(X\u03c4 , T ) = \u2205.\nProof. Let \u03c0(x) = \u03c0(y) = (\u03b4i )i\u2208N and I = {i0 , i1 , ...}, where ij < ij+1 for j \u2208 N.\nWe recall we have |si (x)| = |si (y)| for any i \u2208 N.\n(1) First assume that |I| = \u221e. Then by Lemma 2.5\nx(0, \u221e) = x0 \u03c4 i0 (si0 (x))\u03c4 i1 (si1 (x))...; y(0, \u221e) = y0 \u03c4 i0 (si0 (y))\u03c4 i1 (si1 (y))...\nSince \u03c4 is one-to-one, (x, y) \u2208 A(X\u03c4 , T ) if and only if si (x) = si (y) for any i \u2208 I\nlarge enough. Now assume that |I| < \u221e. In this case |I + (T k (x))| = \u221e, then by\nconsidering (T k (x), T k (y)) instead of (x, y) in previous arguments we conclude (1).\n(2) Assume that \u03c4 has no coincidences. If xi 6= yi for some i \u2208 Z such that\n|I + (T i (x))| = |I + (T i (y))| = \u221e, then for any j \u2208 I + (T i (x)) all corresponding symbols of sj (T i (x)) and sj (T i (y)), and consequently of \u03c4 j (sj (T i (x))) and\n\u03c4 j (sj (T i (y))), are different, which proves that (x, y) is distal. Otherwise there is\ni \u2208 Z such that xi = yi and |I + (T i (x))| = |I + (T i (y))| = \u221e. Then, sj (T i (x)) =\nsj (T i (y)) for any j \u2208 N which implies that (x, y) is asymptotic. This completes the\nproof of (2).\n\u0003\nLet A be an alphabet. In the sequel we will regard A2 as an alphabet of letter-pairs.\nWe identify a pair of words (u, v), with |u| = |v|, with a word of A2 in the obvious\nway.\nThe next proposition provides a general criterion for existence of Li\u2013Yorke pairs.\n\n\f8\n\nConstant-length substitutions and countable scrambled sets\n\nProposition 3.5. Let \u03c4 : A \u2192 A+ be a one\u2013to\u2013one primitive substitution of\nconstant length p such that X\u03c4 is not finite. Then the system has Li\u2013Yorke pairs if\nand only if there exist m \u2208 N, a, b \u2208 A, a 6= b, such that \u03c4 m (a) = uav, \u03c4 m (b) = u\u2032 bv \u2032\nwith |u| = |u\u2032 |, |v| = |v \u2032 |, v 6= v \u2032 and v coincides in at least one coordinate with v \u2032 .\nProof. First we prove the condition is necessary. Let (x, y) \u2208 LY(X\u03c4 , T ). Since\n\u03c0(x) = \u03c0(y), one has k + (x) = k + (y) = k and I + (x) = I + (y) = I. If |I| < \u221e\ninstead of (x, y) consider the pair (T k (x), T k (y)) which is also a Li\u2013Yorke pair and\nfor which |I(T k (x))| = \u221e. So we can assume |I| = \u221e; by Lemma 2.5 x(0, \u221e) =\nx0 \u03c4 i0 (si0 (x))...\u03c4 ij (sij (x))... and y(0, \u221e) = y0 \u03c4 i0 (si0 (y))...\u03c4 ij (sij (y))..., where i0 <\ni1 < ... < ij < ... are the elements of I. Since (x, y) is a Li\u2013Yorke pair the set\nJ \u2286 I, J = {i \u2208 I | si (x) 6= si (y)}, is infinite. This implies, by (2.1), that for any\n(i)\n(i)\nlarge enough i \u2208 N, x0 6= y0 . There are two cases.\nCase 1: I \\ J is infinite.\nFor any i \u2208 I \\ J , si (x) = si (y) so \u03c4 m (si (x)) = \u03c4 m (si (y)) for any m \u2208 N. Consider\n(i)\n(i)\nlarge integers 0 < i < j < k such that i, k \u2208 I \\ J , j \u2208 J and x0 6= y0 . Then, by\nusing (2.1) several times, we get\n(k+1)\n\n\u03c4 k\u2212i+1 (x0\nand\n\n(k+1)\n\n(i)\n\n) = ux0 v\u03c4 (j\u2212i) (sj (x))w\u03c4 k\u2212i (sk (x))\n(i)\n\n\u03c4 k\u2212i+1 (y0\n) = u\u2032 y0 v \u2032 \u03c4 (j\u2212i) (sj (y))w\u2032 \u03c4 k\u2212i (sk (y))\n\u2032\n\u2032\nwith |u| = |u |, |v| = |v | and |w| = |w\u2032 |. Then v\u03c4 (j\u2212i) (sj (x))w\u03c4 k\u2212i (sk (x)) and\nv \u2032 \u03c4 (j\u2212i) (sj (y))w\u2032 \u03c4 k\u2212i (sk (y)) are different (because j \u2208 J ) and have at least one\ncoincidence (because k \u2208 I \\ J ). Since J and I \\ J are infinite there exist triples\n(k+1)\n(i) (i)\n(k+1) (k+1)\n,\n) = (x0 , y0 ). Taking a = x0\n, y0\ni < j < k as before such that (x0\n(k+1)\nb = y0\nand m = k \u2212 i + 1 one concludes.\nCase 2: I \\ J is finite.\nOne can assume J = I. Define for any (a, b) \u2208 A2 the set\nT\u03c4 (a, b) = {(c, d) \u2208 A2 : \u2203m \u2264 |A|2 + 1, (c, d) occurs in (\u03c4 m (a), \u03c4 m (b))}.\nSince (x, y) is a Li\u2013Yorke pair and si (x) 6= si (y) for any i \u2208 I, there is an infinite set\nR \u2286 I such that for any i \u2208 R there exists 0 \u2264 j < |si (x)| with T\u03c4 ((si (x))j , (si (y))j )\ncontaining a diagonal pair (c, c). That is, for some integer 0 \u2264 m \u2264 |A|2 + 1,\n\u03c4 m ((si (x))j ) and \u03c4 m ((si (y))j ) have a coincidence. Since si (x) 6= si (y) we conclude\n(i+1)\n(i+1)\nfor large i \u2208 R that \u03c4 m+1 (x0\n) and \u03c4 m+1 (y0\n) have at least one coincidence\nand two non\u2013coincidences, with one coincidence and one non\u2013coincidence after a\nnon\u2013coincidence. An argument similar to the one used to conclude in Case 1 finishes\nthe proof.\nLet us now prove the condition is sufficient. Assume there exist m \u2208 N, a, b \u2208 A,\na 6= b, such that \u03c4 m (a) = uav, \u03c4 m (b) = u\u2032 bv \u2032 , with |u| = |u\u2032 |, |v| = |v \u2032 |, v 6= v \u2032 and\nv coincides in at least one coordinate with v \u2032 . Without loss of generality suppose\nm = 1. If |u| > 0 consider the points of X\u03c4\nx = ...\u03c4 i (u)...\u03c4 2 (u)\u03c4 (u)u.av\u03c4 (v)\u03c4 2 (v)...\u03c4 i (v)...\nand\ny = ....\u03c4 i (u\u2032 )...\u03c4 2 (u\u2032 )\u03c4 (u\u2032 )u\u2032 .av \u2032 \u03c4 (v \u2032 )\u03c4 2 (v \u2032 )...\u03c4 i (v \u2032 )...\nwhere the zero coordinate is just after the central dot. Clearly (x, y) is a Li\u2013Yorke\npair. If |u| = 0 taking powers of \u03c4 we can assume there exist c, d \u2208 A such that ca\n\n\fFran\u00e7ois Blanchard, Fabien Durand, Alejandro Maass\n\n9\n\nand db are sub\u2013words of X\u03c4 and \u03c4 (c) = ...c, \u03c4 (d) = ...d. In this case consider the\npoints\nx = lim \u03c4 k (c).av\u03c4 (v)\u03c4 2 (v)...\u03c4 i (v)...; y = lim \u03c4 k (d).bv \u2032 \u03c4 (v \u2032 )\u03c4 2 (v \u2032 )...\u03c4 i (v \u2032 )...\nk\u2192\u221e\n\nk\u2192\u221e\n\nwhich form a Li\u2013Yorke pair.\n\n\u0003\n\nThe following result can be deduced from the proof of Proposition 3.5.\nCorollary 3.6. Let \u03c4 : A \u2192 A+ be a one\u2013to\u2013one primitive substitution of constant\nlength p such that X\u03c4 is not finite. Assume \u03c4 has overall coincidences. Let {x, y} \u2282\nX\u03c4 be such that \u03c0(x) = \u03c0(y). Then (x, y) \u2208 LY(X\u03c4 , T ) if and only if for infinitely\n+\n+\nmany i \u2208 N we have either si (x) 6= si (y), or, si (T k (x) (x)) 6= si (T k (y) (y)).\nHere are two general sufficient conditions for the existence of Li\u2013Yorke pairs. The\nproof is left to the reader.\nCorollary 3.7. Let \u03c4 : A \u2192 A+ be a one\u2013to\u2013one primitive substitution of constant\nlength p such that X\u03c4 is not finite.\n(1) If there exists m \u2208 N such that for any a, b \u2208 A, \u03c4 m (a) and \u03c4 m (b) have\ncoincidences and at least two non\u2013coincidences, then LY(X\u03c4 , T ) 6= \u2205.\n(2) Assume there exist m \u2208 N and a, b \u2208 A such that \u03c4 m (a) and \u03c4 m (b) have\ncoincidences and at least two non\u2013coincidences. If for any (c, c\u2032 ), (d, d\u2032 ) \u2208\nA2 , c 6= c\u2032 , d 6= d\u2032 , there is i \u2208 N such that (c, c\u2032 ) is a letter-pair of\n(\u03c4 i (d), \u03c4 i (d\u2032 )) then the system has Li\u2013Yorke pairs.\nIn part (1) of this corollary one cannot replace 'for any a, b \u2208 A' by 'there are a, b \u2208\nA'. Consider the substitution \u03c4 : {0, 1, 2, 3} \u2192 {0, 1, 2, 3}+ given by \u03c4 (0) = 0123,\n\u03c4 (1) = 1032, \u03c4 (2) = 1023 and \u03c4 (3) = 0132. For any m \u2208 N and a, b \u2208 {0, 1, 2, 3},\neither \u03c4 m (a) and \u03c4 m (b) have a common prefix and after this prefix they have no\ncoincidences, or they have a suffix in common but no coincidences before this suffix\nstarts.\nThen one proves by contradiction that \u03c4 does not check the condition of Proposition\n3.5, and LY(X\u03c4 , T ) = \u2205. On the other hand \u03c4 m (1) and \u03c4 m (2) have coincidences\nand at least two non\u2013coincidences so 1 and 2 verify the condition in part (1) of the\nprevious corollary for any m \u2208 N.\nNow we give a necessary and sufficient condition to have uncountably many Li\u2013\nYorke pairs.\nProposition 3.8. Let \u03c4 : A \u2192 A+ be a one\u2013to\u2013one primitive substitution of\nconstant length p such that X\u03c4 is not finite. Then the set of orbits of Li\u2013Yorke\npairs of X\u03c4 is either finite or uncountable. Moreover, the set of Li\u2013Yorke pairs is\nuncountable if and only if\n(3.1)\n\n\u2203m \u2208 N, \u2203a, b \u2208 A, a 6= b, \u03c4 m (a) = uavaw, \u03c4 m (b) = u\u2032 bv \u2032 bw\u2032\nwith |u| = |u\u2032 |, |v| = |v \u2032 |, |w| = |w\u2032 |, vaw and v \u2032 bw\u2032 have a coincidence.\n\nProof. First we prove that (3.1) is a necessary and sufficient condition to have\nuncountably many Li\u2013Yorke pairs.\nAssume (3.1) holds. Without loss of generality suppose that m = 1. We set p0 = u,\np1 = uav, s0 = vaw, s1 = w, q0 = u\u2032 , q1 = u\u2032 bv \u2032 , t0 = v \u2032 bw\u2032 and t1 = w\u2032 . Given a\nsequence n = (ni )i\u2208N \u2208 {0, 1}N which contains infinitely many 0's and 1's we define\npoints\nx(n) = ...\u03c4 2 (pn2 )\u03c4 (pn1 )pn0 .asn0 \u03c4 1 (sn1 )\u03c4 2 (sn2 )...\n\n\f10\n\nConstant-length substitutions and countable scrambled sets\n\ny(n) = ...\u03c4 2 (qn2 )\u03c4 (qn1 )qn0 .btn0 \u03c4 1 (tn1 )\u03c4 2 (tn2 )...\nwhere the central dot separates negative and positive coordinates. One verifies\neasily that x(n) and y(n) belong to X\u03c4 and that they form a Li\u2013Yorke pair. Also\nif n, n\u2032 \u2208 {0, 1}N, n 6= n\u2032 , then x(n) 6= x(n\u2032 ) and y(n) 6= y(n\u2032 ), because they do not\nhave the same image in the odometer. Therefore, LY(X\u03c4 , T ) is uncountable.\nNow assume that condition (3.1) is not satisfied: then the number of orbits of\nLi\u2013Yorke pairs in LY(X\u03c4 , T ) is finite. To prove this claim we consider a Li\u2013\nYorke pair (x, y) \u2208 LY(X\u03c4 , T ) and show that the sequences (x(i) (\u2212\u03b4i , \u2212\u03b4i + p \u2212\n1), y (i) (\u2212\u03b4i , \u2212\u03b4i + p \u2212 1))i\u2208N and (\u03b4i )i\u2208N are ultimately periodic and periods can be\ntaken to be smaller than |A|2 + 1.\nAs in the proof of Proposition 3.5 one can assume that |I + (x)| = |I + (y)| = \u221e.\nTherefore, for reasons similar to those in Cases 1 and 2 of the proof of Proposition\n3.5, there exist a, b \u2208 A, a 6= b, such that for infinitely many i \u2208 N there is mi \u2208 N\nfor which\n(i)\n\n(3.2)\n\n(i\u2212m )\n\n(i)\n\n(i\u2212m )\n\ni\ni\n(i) x0 = x0\n= a, y0 = y0\n= b,\n(i)\n(i\u2212m\n)\n(i)\n(i\u2212mi ) \u2032\ni\n(ii) \u03c4 mi (x0 ) = ui x0\nvi , \u03c4 mi (y0 ) = u\u2032i y0\nvi ,\nwith |ui | = |u\u2032i |, |vi | = |vi\u2032 |, vi has a coincidence with vi\u2032 .\n\nClaim. For all r \u2265 1 the word (\u03c4 r (a), \u03c4 r (b)) contains (a, b) as a sub-word at most\nonce.\nProof of the claim. Assume this is not true. Then for some r \u2265 1, \u03c4 r (a) = paqas,\n\u03c4 r (b) = p\u2032 bq \u2032 bs\u2032 , with |p| = |p\u2032 | and |q| = |q \u2032 |. Therefore for any i \u2208 N such that\ncondition (3.2) holds \u03c4 r+mi (a) = uavaw, \u03c4 r+mi (b) = u\u2032 bv \u2032 bw\u2032 , with |u| = |u\u2032 |,\n|v| = |v \u2032 |, |w| = |w\u2032 | and vaw has at least one coincidence with v \u2032 bw\u2032 . This is a\ncontradiction since condition (3.1) does not hold.\n\u0003\nLet r be the smallest positive integer such that (\u03c4 r (a), \u03c4 r (b)) has (a, b) as a subword. It results from the claim that (a, b) appears exactly once in (\u03c4 kr (a), \u03c4 kr (b))\nfor any k \u2265 1. Moreover, again by the claim, we have that (a, b) is not a sub-word of\n(\u03c4 kr+l (a), \u03c4 kr+l (b)) for k \u2265 1 and l \u2208 {1, ..., r \u2212 1}. Since there are infinitely many\ni \u2208 N such that condition (3.2) holds, this implies that the sequences (x(i) (\u2212\u03b4i , \u2212\u03b4i +\np \u2212 1), y (i)(\u2212\u03b4i , \u2212\u03b4i + p \u2212 1))i\u2208N and (\u03b4i )i\u2208N are ultimately periodic, and periods can\nbe taken to be smaller than |A|2 + 1. This proves that the set of Li\u2013Yorke pairs is\ncountable. Moreover, by (2.3) and (2.4), (x, y) are in the orbit of a Li\u2013 Yorke pair\n(x\u2032 , y \u2032 ) such that the sequences (x\u2032(i) (\u2212\u03b4i , \u2212\u03b4i +p\u22121))i\u2208N , (y \u2032(i) (\u2212\u03b4i , \u2212\u03b4i +p\u22121))i\u2208N ,\nare periodic. To conclude we remark, again by (2.3) and (2.4), that such a sequence\ndetermines a finite number of points; thus there are finitely many orbits of Li\u2013Yorke\npairs in X\u03c4 \u00d7 X\u03c4 .\n\u0003\nProposition 3.9. Let \u03c4 : A \u2192 A+ be a one\u2013to\u2013one primitive substitution of\nconstant length p such that X\u03c4 is not finite and condition (3.1) holds. Then (X\u03c4 , T )\nhas strong Li\u2013Yorke pairs.\nProof. By taking a power of the substitution \u03c4 we can assume that \u2203a, b \u2208 A, a 6= b,\n\u03c4 (a) = uavaw, \u03c4 (b) = u\u2032 bv \u2032 bw\u2032 with |u| = |u\u2032 | 6= 0, |v| = |v \u2032 |, |w| = |w\u2032 | 6= 0, vaw\nand v \u2032 bw\u2032 have a coincidence. Then the points\nx = ...\u03c4 2m (u)\u03c4 2m\u22121 (uav)...\u03c4 (uav)u.avaw\u03c4 (w)...\u03c4 2m\u22121 (w)\u03c4 2m (vaw)...\ny = ...\u03c4 2m (u\u2032 )\u03c4 2m\u22121 (u\u2032 bv \u2032 )...\u03c4 (u\u2032 bv \u2032 )u\u2032 .bv \u2032 bw\u2032 \u03c4 (w\u2032 )...\u03c4 2m\u22121 (w\u2032 )\u03c4 2m (v \u2032 bw\u2032 )...\n\n\fFran\u00e7ois Blanchard, Fabien Durand, Alejandro Maass\n\n11\n\nform a Li\u2013Yorke pair which is recurrent. Indeed, for every n \u2208 N there is m \u2208 N\nsuch that (x(\u2212n, n), y(\u2212n, n)) is a sub-word of (\u03c4 2m (a), \u03c4 2m (b)).\n\u0003\nWe deduce the following equivalences.\nCorollary 3.10. Let \u03c4 : A \u2192 A+ be a one\u2013to\u2013one primitive substitution of constant\nlength p such that X\u03c4 is not finite. Then the following statements are equivalent.\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n(5)\n\n(X\u03c4 , T ) has uncountably many Li-Yorke pairs;\n(X\u03c4 , T ) has infinitely many Li-Yorke orbits;\n(X\u03c4 , T ) has at least one strong Li-Yorke pair;\n(X\u03c4 , T ) has uncountably many strong Li-Yorke orbits;\nCondition (3.1) holds for \u03c4 .\n\nProof. If (X\u03c4 , T ) has finitely many Li-Yorke orbits then (X\u03c4 , T ) has countably\nmany Li-Yorke pairs. Consequently, (1) implies (2).\nProposition 3.9 gives that (2) implies (3).\nWe use a remark of Akin to prove that (3) implies (4). Let (x, y) be a strong LiYorke pair of (X\u03c4 , T ). It is transitive in the closure of its orbit, K = clos({(T \u00d7\nT )n (x, y) : n \u2208 Z}), which intersects the diagonal. Then the set of transitive points\nof (K, T \u00d7 T ) is a dense G\u03b4 subset of K, therefore uncountable; it is also a set of\nLi-Yorke pairs of (X\u03c4 , T ). Hence, (X\u03c4 , T ) has uncountably many strong Li-Yorke\npairs and, consequently, uncountably many strong Li-Yorke orbits.\nStatement (4) implies (5) by Proposition 3.8. In the same way (5) implies (1). \u0003\nExamples.\n(1) The substitution \u03c4 : {a, b, c} \u2192 {a, b, c}+, \u03c4 (a) = aba, \u03c4 (b) = bca, \u03c4 (c) = cca,\nhas countably many Li\u2013Yorke pairs. Corollary 3.10 says that (X\u03c4 , T ) has no strong\nLi\u2013Yorke pairs.\n(2) By Proposition 3.8 the substitution \u03c4 : {a, b, c, d} \u2192 {a, b, c, d}+ given by\n\u03c4 (a) = baacd, \u03c4 (b) = bbbcd, \u03c4 (c) = bcaba and \u03c4 (d) = bdabd has uncountably many\nLi\u2013Yorke pairs; by Proposition 3.9 (X\u03c4 , T ) has strong Li\u2013Yorke pairs. We show it\nalso has non\u2013recurrent Li\u2013Yorke pairs. Consider the points\nx = lim \u03c4 m (b).\u03c4 m (c); y = lim \u03c4 m (b).\u03c4 m (d).\nm\u2192\u221e\n\nm\u2192\u221e\n\nBy Corollary 3.6, (x, y) is a Li-Yorke pair of (X\u03c4 , T ). But it is not recurrent since for\nevery positive integers i, m, i < m, (\u03c4 i (c), \u03c4 i (d)) is not a sub-word of (\u03c4 m (c), \u03c4 m (d)).\n(3) Let A = {0, 1} and \u03c4 : A \u2192 A+ be a primitive substitution with X\u03c4 not finite.\nIf condition (3.1) holds then all Li-Yorke pairs of (X\u03c4 , T ) are recurrent.\nWhen A = {0, 1} we can characterize asymptotic, distal and Li\u2013Yorke pairs.\nCorollary 3.11. Let \u03c4 : {0, 1} \u2192 {0, 1}+ be a one\u2013to\u2013one primitive substitution\nof constant length p having a coincidence and such that X\u03c4 is not finite. Consider\n{x, y} \u2286 X\u03c4 such that \u03c0(x) = \u03c0(y).\n(1) Assume |I + (x)| = \u221e. If for infinitely many i \u2208 I + (x), si (x) 6= si (y), then\n(x, y) is a Li\u2013Yorke pair, otherwise (x, y) is an asymptotic pair.\n(2) Assume |I + (x)| < \u221e. If \u03c4 (0) and \u03c4 (1) begin by the same letter then (x, y)\nis an asymptotic pair, otherwise (x, y) can be an asymptotic or a Li\u2013Yorke\npair but not a distal pair.\n\n\f12\n\nConstant-length substitutions and countable scrambled sets\n\nProof. It is a consequence of Proposition 3.4 (1) and Corollary 3.6. We only give\nthe proof of (2). Assume |I + (x)| < \u221e and put k(x) = k(y) = k. If si (T k (x)) =\nsi (T k (y)) for any large i \u2208 N, by Proposition 3.4 (1), (x, y) is an asymptotic pair.\nIn particular this condition holds whenever \u03c4 (0) and \u03c4 (1) begins by the same letter.\nIf si (T k (x)) 6= si (T k (y)) for infinitely many i \u2208 N, since \u03c4 has overall coincidences,\nthen by Corollary 3.6 one concludes that (x, y) is a Li\u2013Yorke pair.\n\u0003\nCorollary 3.12. Let \u03c4 : {0, 1} \u2192 {0, 1}+ be a one\u2013to\u2013one primitive substitution\nof constant length p such that X\u03c4 is not finite. Consider {x, y} \u2286 X\u03c4 such that\n\u03c0(x) = \u03c0(y). Then\n(1) If there is no coincidence then {x, y} is distal whenever there is i \u2208 N such\nthat xi 6= yi and |I + (T i (x))| = |I + (T i (y))| = \u221e. In any other case the\npair is asymptotic.\n(2) If there exists a unique non\u2013coincidence then {x, y} is asymptotic.\n(3) There exist Li\u2013Yorke pairs if and only if there exist coincidences and at least\ntwo non\u2013coincidences. Moreover, (x, y) is a Li\u2013Yorke pair if and only if for\n+\ninfinitely many i \u2208 N, si (x) 6= si (y) if |I + (x)| = \u221e, or, si (T k (x) (x)) 6=\n+\nsi (T k (y) (y)) if |I + (x)| < \u221e.\nProof.\n(1) Immediate by Proposition 3.4 (2) since the alphabet has size two.\n(2) First assume that |I + (x)| = |I + (y)| = \u221e. If x(i) (0) = y (i) (0) for any\ni \u2208 N then (x, y) is an asymptotic pair. Otherwise for any large enough\ni \u2208 I + (x) one has x(i) (0) 6= y (i) (0); thus, since \u03c4 has a unique non\u2013\ncoincidence, si (x) = si (y). Then by Proposition 3.4 (1) x and y are asymptotic. If |I + (x)| = |I + (y)| < \u221e then |I + (T k (x))| = |I + (T k (y))| = \u221e\nwhere k + (x) = k + (y) = k. By the argument above T k (x) and T k (y) are\nasymptotic, and consequently x and y too.\n(3) This is a consequence of Corollary 3.6 and Proposition 3.5.\n\u0003\nExamples. The system defined by the substitution \u03c4 : {0, 1} \u2192 {0, 1}+, \u03c4 (0) =\n010, \u03c4 (1) = 100 has Li\u2013Yorke pairs and all scrambled sets are finite; the system\ndefined by the Morse substitution \u03c4 : {0, 1} \u2192 {0, 1}+, \u03c4 (0) = 01, \u03c4 (1) = 10 has\nonly distal and asymptotic pairs in the fibres over the odometer; and the system\ndefined by \u03c4 : {0, 1} \u2192 {0, 1}+, \u03c4 (0) = 01, \u03c4 (1) = 00 has only asymptotic pairs in\nfibres over the odometer. The last substitution defines a Toeplitz subshift.\nBy increasing the alphabet it is easy to obtain substitution systems with scrambled\nsets having exactly the cardinality of the alphabet. For A = {0, ..., n}, n > 0,\nconsider the primitive one\u2013to\u2013one substitution \u03c4 : A \u2192 A+ defined for a \u2208 A by\n\u03c4 (a) = 0aa(a + 1)0 where n + 1 = 0. Clearly X\u03c4 is not finite. Define for a \u2208 A\nx(a) = ...\u03c4 i (0)...\u03c4 (0)0.aa(a + 1)0\u03c4 (a(a + 1)0)...\u03c4 i (a(a + 1)0)... \u2208 X\u03c4\nwhere the zero coordinate is the one just after the central dot. Then S = {x(a) :\na \u2208 A} is a scrambled set of size |A|.\n4. A dynamical system with countable scrambled sets\nLet n \u2265 1. For An = {0, ..., n} define the primitive substitution \u03c4n : An \u2192 A3n by\n\u03c4n (a) = a0(a + 1) if a 6= n and \u03c4n (n) = n0n. Set X\u03c4n = Xn ; the shift map on Xn\nis denoted by Tn . We verify that Xn is not finite. Let \u03c1n : An+1 \u2192 An be defined\n\n\fFran\u00e7ois Blanchard, Fabien Durand, Alejandro Maass\n\n13\n\nby \u03c1n (a) = a if a 6= n + 1 and \u03c1n (n + 1) = n; obviously \u03c1n \u25e6 \u03c4n+1 = \u03c4n \u25e6 \u03c1n . The\nmap \u03c1n extends by concatenation to any word of A+\nn+1 ; it induces a factor map\nthat we also call \u03c1n : Xn+1 \u2192 Xn . Remark that each \u03c4n satisfies the conditions of\nProposition 3.5.\nLet (X, T ) be the minimal dynamical system defined by\nY\nX = {(xn )n\u22651 \u2208\nXn : \u2200n \u2265 1, \u03c1n (xn+1 ) = xn } ;\nn\u22651\n\nput T ((xn )n\u22651 ) = (Tn (xn ))n\u22651 . Each system (Xn , Tn ) is a factor of (X, T ) and\nthe maximal equicontinuous factor of (X, T ) and (Xn , Tn ) is the 3\u2013odometer (see\n[Q]). Denote by \u03c0n : Xn \u2192 O3 and \u03c0 : X \u2192 O3 the corresponding factor maps. If\nx = (xn )n\u22651 \u2208 X then \u03c0n (xn ) = \u03c0(x) for all n. Each \u03c4n has overall coincidences,\nthen \u03c0n is a proximal map. The inverse limit of proximal maps is a proximal map,\nso, once again, the Li\u2013Yorke pairs are exactly the non-asymptotic pairs in the fibers\nof \u03c0. We show that fibres of \u03c0 are at most countable and construct a countable\nscrambled set. Since any scrambled set is included in one fibre, all scrambled sets\nof (X, T ) are finite or countable.\nFor any z \u2208 Xm , m \u2265 1, let (z (i) )i\u2208N be the sequence in Xm given by Theorem 2.4.\nRecall that if \u03c0m (z) = (\u03b4i )i\u2208N one has\n(4.1)\n\n(i+1)\n\n\u03c4m (z0\n\n) = z (i) (\u2212\u03b4i , \u2212\u03b4i + 2)\n\nand thus\n(4.2) z (j) (\u2212\u03b4j , \u2212\u03b4j + 2), j < i, are determined once we know z (i) (\u2212\u03b4i , \u2212\u03b4i + 2).\nBoth properties are extensively used in the proofs of this section.\nLemma 4.1. Let x \u2208 Xn for some given n \u2265 1.\n(1) If for infinitely many i \u2208 N, x(i) (\u2212\u03b4i , \u2212\u03b4i + 2) = ai 0(ai + 1) for some\nai \u2208 An\u22121 , then there is a sequence v \u2208 (A3n+1 )N such that (y (i) (\u2212\u03b4i , \u2212\u03b4i +\n2))i\u2208N = v for any y \u2208 \u03c1\u22121\nn ({x}). Moreover, for infinitely many i \u2208 N,\nvi = ai 0(ai + 1) for some ai \u2208 An .\n(2) If for any big enough i \u2208 N, x(i) (\u2212\u03b4i , \u2212\u03b4i + 2) = n0n, then there are two\nsequences v, v \u2032 \u2208 (A3n+1 )N with vi = (n0(n + 1)) and vi\u2032 = ((n + 1)0(n + 1))\nfor any enough large i \u2208 N, such that (y (i) (\u2212\u03b4i , \u2212\u03b4i + 2))i\u2208N = v or v \u2032 for\nany y \u2208 \u03c1\u22121\nn ({x}). Moreover, if for infinitely many i \u2208 N, \u03b4i = 2, then\n(i)\n(y (\u2212\u03b4i , \u2212\u03b4i + 2))i\u2208N = v \u2032 for any y \u2208 \u03c1\u22121\nn ({x}).\nProof. Let y \u2208 Xn+1 and x = \u03c1n (y) \u2208 Xn . Put \u03c0n (x) = \u03c0n+1 (y) = (\u03b4i )i\u2208N , then\n\u03c1n (y (i) (\u2212\u03b4i , \u2212\u03b4i + 2)) = x(i) (\u2212\u03b4i , \u2212\u03b4i + 2) for all i \u2208 N.\n(1) If x(i) (\u2212\u03b4i , \u2212\u03b4i + 2) = a0(a + 1) with a \u2208 An\u22121 then a0(a + 1) is the unique subword of Xn+1 such that \u03c1n (a0(a+1)) = a0(a+1), then y (i) (\u2212\u03b4i , \u2212\u03b4i +2) = a0(a+1).\nTherefore, if for infinitely many i \u2208 N, x(i) (\u2212\u03b4i , \u2212\u03b4i + 2) = a0(a + 1) for some\na \u2208 An\u22121 , by (4.2), the sequence (y (i) (\u2212\u03b4i , \u2212\u03b4i + 2))i\u2208N is completely determined\ngiven x, it is unique and for infinitely many i \u2208 N, y (i) (\u2212\u03b4i , \u2212\u03b4i + 2) = a0(a + 1)\nfor some a \u2208 An\u22121 \u2286 An . This completes the proof of (1).\n(2) Assume that x(i) (\u2212\u03b4i , \u2212\u03b4i + 2) = n0n for any i \u2265 i0 . As n occurs only in\nthe first and last positions of \u03c4n (n), so \u03b4i can only be 0 or 2 for i > i0 . Also, if\nx(i) (\u2212\u03b4i , \u2212\u03b4i + 2) = n0n then n0(n + 1) and (n + 1)0(n + 1) are the only sub-words\n\n\f14\n\nConstant-length substitutions and countable scrambled sets\n\nof Xn+1 such that \u03c1n (n0(n + 1)) = \u03c1n ((n + 1)0(n + 1)) = n0n, then for i \u2265 i0 ,\ny (i) (\u2212\u03b4i , \u2212\u03b4i + 2) = n0(n + 1) or (n + 1)0(n + 1).\nAssume that for some i \u2265 i0 , y (i) (\u2212\u03b4i , \u2212\u03b4i + 2) = n0(n + 1). Then, by definition\nof \u03c4n+1 , y (i+1) (\u2212\u03b4i+1 , \u2212\u03b4i+1 + 2) = n0(n + 1) and \u03b4i+1 = 0. Inductively we deduce\nthat y (j) (\u2212\u03b4j , \u2212\u03b4j + 2) = n0(n + 1) and \u03b4j = 0 for any j > i. By using (4.2), we\nconclude (y (i) (\u2212\u03b4i , \u2212\u03b4i +2))i\u2208N can be equal to two possibles sequences. One is such\nthat (y (i) (\u2212\u03b4i , \u2212\u03b4i + 2))i\u2265j0 = (n0(n + 1))i\u2265j0 and the other verifies (y (i) (\u2212\u03b4i , \u2212\u03b4i +\n2))i\u2265j0 = ((n + 1)0(n + 1))i\u2265j0 , where j0 \u2208 N. But, if for infinitely many i \u2208 N,\n\u03b4i = 2, the sequence (y (i) (\u2212\u03b4i , \u2212\u03b4i + 2))i\u2208N can take a unique value such that\n\u0003\n(y (i) (\u2212\u03b4i , \u2212\u03b4i + 2))i\u2265j0 = ((n + 1)0(n + 1))i\u2265j0 for some j0 \u2208 N.\nLemma 4.2. Let x \u2208 Xn for some given n \u2265 1.\n(1) \u03c1\u22121\nn ({x}) contains at most two elements; when it contains two, one of them\nhas a unique preimage under \u03c1n+1 .\n(2) If x has a unique preimage under \u03c1n , there exists a unique sequence\n(xm )m\u2265n such that x = xn , xm \u2208 Xm and \u03c1m (xm+1 ) = xm for m \u2265 n.\nProof. Let y \u2208 Xn+1 and x = \u03c1n (y) \u2208 Xn . Put \u03c0n (x) = \u03c0n+1 (y) = (\u03b4i )i\u2208N .\n(1) We consider three cases.\n(i)\n(a) First suppose that \u03b4i = 0 for i \u2265 i0 . By definition of \u03c4n and \u03c4n+1 , x\u22121 = n\n(i)\n\nand y\u22121 = n + 1 for i \u2265 i0 . Then, we deduce from (2.4) and Lemma 2.5 that\nm\n(n)y(M, \u221e) for some M \u2208 Z,\nx = limm\u2192\u221e \u03c4nm (n)x(M, \u221e) and y = limm\u2192\u221e \u03c4n+1\nwhere x(M, \u221e), y(M, \u221e), are uniquely determined by (x(i) (\u2212\u03b4i , \u2212\u03b4i + 2))i\u2208N and\n(y (i) (\u2212\u03b4i , \u2212\u03b4i + 2))i\u2208N respectively. Therefore, by Lemma 4.1, x has at most two\npreimages under \u03c1n , one of which has a unique preimage under \u03c1n+1 since it verifies\ncondition (1) in Lemma 4.1.\n(b) When \u03b4i = 2 for i \u2265 i0 , by definition of \u03c4n , one has x(i) (\u2212\u03b4i , \u2212\u03b4i + 2) = n0n for\ni \u2265 i0 . We also deduce from (2.3) and Lemma 2.5 that for some M \u2208 N and a \u2208\nm\nAn , x = x(\u2212\u221e, M ) limm\u2192\u221e \u03c4nm (a). Therefore y = y(\u2212\u221e, M ) limm\u2192\u221e \u03c4n+1\n(a) if\nm\nm\na 6= n, and y = y(\u2212\u221e, M ) limm\u2192\u221e \u03c4n+1\n(n) or y = y(\u2212\u221e, M ) limm\u2192\u221e \u03c4n+1\n(n + 1)\nif a = n. In both cases y(\u2212\u221e, M ) is uniquely determined from the sequence\n(y (i) (\u2212\u03b4i , \u2212\u03b4i + 2))i\u2208N . But in the case we are studying, by Lemma 4.1 (2), this\nsequence is uniquely determined from x and verifies (y (i) (\u2212\u03b4i , \u2212\u03b4i + 2))i\u2265j0 = ((n +\n1)0(n+1))i\u2265j0 for some j0 \u2208 N. We conclude y can take at most two possible values,\nwhich proves the first statement of (1). To finish the proof of (1) in this case observe\nm\nm\n(n) is the\nthat if y = y(\u2212\u221e, M ) limm\u2192\u221e \u03c4n+1\n(n) then z = z(\u2212\u221e, M ) limm\u2192\u221e \u03c4n+2\nunique preimage of y under \u03c1n+1 , where z(\u2212\u221e, M ) is uniquely determined given y\nby Lemma 4.1 (2).\n(c) Finally if none of the two conditions above is checked, x and y are uniquely\ndetermined by the sequences (x(i) (\u2212\u03b4i , \u2212\u03b4i + 2))i\u2208N and (y (i) (\u2212\u03b4i , \u2212\u03b4i + 2))i\u2208N . By\nLemma 4.1 (2), y can take at most two values, one of which must have a unique\npreimage under \u03c1n+1 by the same lemma. This completes the proof of (1).\n(2) The proof above shows that y is the unique preimage of x under \u03c1n if and only\nif one of the following three cases occur:\n(i) for infinitely many i \u2208 N, x(i) (\u2212\u03b4i , \u2212\u03b4i + 2) = y (i) (\u2212\u03b4i , \u2212\u03b4i + 2) = a0(a + 1), a \u2208\nAn\u22121 and \u03b4i 6= 2;\n\n\fFran\u00e7ois Blanchard, Fabien Durand, Alejandro Maass\n\n15\n\n(ii) for infinitely many i \u2208 N, \u03b4i = 2, for infinitely many i \u2208 N, \u03b4i = 0 and there is\ni0 \u2208 N such that x(i) (\u2212\u03b4i , \u2212\u03b4i + 2) = n0n, y (i) (\u2212\u03b4i , \u2212\u03b4i + 2) = (n + 1)0(n + 1) for\ni \u2265 i0 ;\n(iii) there is i0 \u2208 N such that for i \u2265 i0 , \u03b4i = 2, x(i) (\u2212\u03b4i , \u2212\u03b4i + 2) = n0n,\ny (i) (\u2212\u03b4i , \u2212\u03b4i + 2) = (n + 1)0(n + 1) and for some M \u2208 N and a \u2208 An\u22121 , y =\nm\ny(\u2212\u221e, M ) limm\u2192\u221e \u03c4n+1\n(a).\nIn case (i), by Lemma 4.1 and the proof of (a) and (c) above, there is a unique\nz \u2208 Xn+2 such that \u03c1n+1 (z) = y; it is uniquely determined by (y (i) (\u2212\u03b4i , \u2212\u03b4i +2))i\u2208N .\nMoreover, (z (i) (\u2212\u03b4i , \u2212\u03b4i + 2))i\u2208N also verifies condition (i). Then we conclude by\ninduction.\nIn cases (ii) and (iii) the proof is analogous.\n\u0003\nProposition 4.3. The map \u03c0 : X \u2192 O3 is at most countable\u2013to\u2013one.\nProof. Let \u03b4 \u2208 ZN\n3 . One has\n\u03c0 \u22121 ({\u03b4}) = {(xi )i\u22651 \u2208 X : \u03c01 (x1 ) = \u03b4} = \u222ax\u2208\u03c0\u22121 ({\u03b4}) X(x),\n1\n\nwhere X(x) = {(xi )i\u22651 \u2208 X : x1 = x}. By Lemma 4.2 the set X(x) is at most\ncountable; \u03c01\u22121 ({\u03b4}) is finite by Lemma 2.7.\n\u0003\nNow we construct a countable scrambled set. Let n \u2265 1 and m \u2265 n. Remark that\nm\nthe words m(n \u2212 1) and nn can be obtained as sub-words of \u03c4m\n(0(n \u2212 1)) and\nn\n\u03c4m\n(0n) respectively, then they are sub-words of Xm . So we can define\nx(n) = lim \u03c4nk (n).n0n\u03c4n (0n)...\u03c4ni (0n)... \u2208 Xn\nk\u2192\u221e\n\nand\nk\ni\ny(m, n) = lim \u03c4m\n(m).(n \u2212 1)0n\u03c4m (0n)...\u03c4m\n(0n)... \u2208 Xm\nk\u2192\u221e\n\nwhere the symbol after the dot is the zero coordinate. Clearly \u03c1n (x(n + 1)) =\n\u03c1n (y(n + 1, n + 1)) = x(n) and \u03c1m (y(m + 1, n)) = y(m, n), so that\nS = \u222an\u22652 {(x(1), ..., x(n \u2212 1), y(n, n), y(n + 1, n), y(n + 2, n), ...)} \u2282 X.\nProposition 4.4. The countable set S is a scrambled set of (X, T ).\nProof. It is enough to observe that (x(n), y(n, n)) \u2208 A(X, T ), (x(m), y(m, n)) \u2208\nLY(X, T ), m > n, and (y(m, n), y(m, k)) \u2208 LY(X, T ), m \u2265 n, m \u2265 k, m 6= k. \u0003\n5. A further example\nLike the example in [Au], p.26, and examples in Section 3 the system we describe\nnow is semi\u2013distal but not almost distal; unlike these examples, it is an extension\nof an irrational rotation and has countably many Li-Yorke pairs.\nLet us denote by S the circle and consider its representation as the quotient group\nR/Z. Given a real number t we denote by {t} the fractional part of t (that is, {t}\nis the unique representative in [0, 1) of the mod Z congruence class of t). Fix an\nirrational number \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1) and consider R\u03b1 : S \u2192 S to be the rotation by \u03b1 on\nthe circle, R\u03b1 (t) = {t + \u03b1}. The system (S, R\u03b1 ) is minimal and isometric, and so\nis distal.\nLet n0 = 1. Choose an increasing sequence of positive integers, {ni : i \u2265 1},\nsuch that the fractional parts {{nj \u03b1} : j \u2265 1} form a decreasing sequence in the\nunit interval which converges to \u03b1. Observe that {nj \u03b1} is the fractional part of\nn \u22121\nn\nR\u03b1j (0) = R\u03b1j (\u03b1). Now choose \u03b2 1 so that {n1 \u03b1} < \u03b2 1 < 1 and \u03b2 1 is not a\n\n\f16\n\nConstant-length substitutions and countable scrambled sets\n\nrational linear combination of 1 and \u03b1. In particular, \u03b2 1 + Z is not in the orbit of\n\u03b1 + Z in S. Inductively for j > 1, choose \u03b2 j rationally independent of 1, \u03b1 and\nj\nj\n\u03b2 k for k < j such that\nS {nj \u03b1} < \u03b2 < {nj\u22121 \u03b1}. Let Ij = [{nj \u03b1}, \u03b2 ] for j \u2265 1\nIj . Thus, K is a closed set in the unit interval, and by\nand let K = {\u03b1} \u222a\nj\u22651\n\nprojecting we can regard it as a closed set in S. The boundary of K consists of\n\u2202\u03b1 = {{nj \u03b1} : j \u2265 0} and \u2202\u03b2 = {\u03b2 j : j \u2265 1}. The points of \u2202\u03b1 lie on the orbit of \u03b1\nwhile the points in \u2202\u03b2 are all on distinct orbits different from the \u03b1 orbit as well.\nPut A = {0, 1} and let c0 : S \u2192 A be the characteristic function of K. That\nis, c0 (t) = 1 if t \u2208 K and c0 (t) = 0 otherwise. Notice that c0 is continuous at\ni\nevery point of S except for those on the boundary of K. Let ci = c0 \u25e6 R\u03b1\nfor\nZ\ni \u2208 Z. Finally, define c : S \u2192 A by c(t) = (ci (t) : i \u2208 Z). Notice that c defines a\ncommuting map between (S, R\u03b1 ) and (AZ , T ) where T is the shift map. Denote by\ncont(c) the continuity set of c. It is given by\n[\ncont(c)c = {{\u03b1 + n\u03b1} : n \u2208 Z} \u222a\n{{\u03b2 j + n\u03b1} : n \u2208 Z}.\nj\u22651\n\nThe graph of c, G(c) = {(t, c(t)) : t \u2208 S}, is an R\u03b1 \u00d7 T invariant subset of S \u00d7 AZ .\nSince c is not continuous, it is not a closed subset. However, Gcont(c) = {(t, c(t)) :\nt \u2208 cont(c)} form a dense subset of G(c).\nLet Z denote the closure of G(c) in S \u00d7 AZ . This is a R\u03b1 \u00d7 T invariant subset of\nS \u00d7 AZ . We denote by F : Z \u2192 Z the restriction of R\u03b1 \u00d7 T to Z and by \u03c1 : Z \u2192 S\nthe coordinate projection. Clearly, \u03c1 is a factor map from (Z, F ) to (S, R\u03b1 ). For\nt \u2208 S let Zt = {(s, c(s)) \u2208 Z : \u03c1(s) = t} denote the fiber \u03c1\u22121 ({t}) in Z.\nLemma 5.1. If t \u2208 cont(c) then (t, c(t)) is the unique point of Z such that\n\u03c1(t, c(t)) = t. In particular, Zt is a singleton set. More generally, if (t, x) \u2208 Z\ni\nand t is a continuity point for ci (that is, R\u03b1\n(t) is not in the boundary of K) then\nxi = ci (t).\nProof. We leave it as an exercise.\n\n\u0003\n\nAs we observed before the set Gcont(c) is dense in Z, then \u03c1 is an almost one-toone map. Such maps are always proximal and minimality is preserved by almost\none-to-one lifts. Therefore (Z, F ) is a minimal system.\nFor each t \u2208 cont(c) there is a unique F orbit in Z lying over its R\u03b1 orbit in S.\nThe remaining orbits are those of the \u03b2 j for j \u2265 1 and the orbit of \u03b1.\nLemma 5.2. For j \u2265 1 the fiber Z\u03b2 j consists of two points z j+ = (\u03b2 j , aj ) and\nz j\u2212 = (\u03b2 j , bj ) with aji = bji = ci (\u03b2 j ) for all i \u2265 1 and with aj0 = 1 and bj0 = 0.\nProof. Let j \u2265 1. If a sequence (tk )k\u2208N approaches \u03b2 j from above then, eventually,\ntk \u2208\n/ K and so, eventually, c0 (tk ) = 0. For i \u2265 1 the function ci is continuous at \u03b2 j ,\nso the sequence (ci (tk ))k\u2208N has limit ci (\u03b2 j ). Thus, ((tk , c(tk )))k\u2208N approaches z j\u2212 .\nIf (tk )k\u2208N approaches \u03b2 j from below then, eventually, tk \u2208 K, and so ((tk , c(tk )))k\u2208N\napproaches z j+ . Any real sequence admits a monotone subsequence, then these are\nthe only points in Z\u03b2 j .\n\u0003\nLemma 5.3. The fiber Z\u03b1 consists of three points z +1 = (\u03b1, a), z \u2212 = (\u03b1, b) and\nz +0 = (\u03b1, \u0101) such that:\nfor i \u2208\n/ {nj \u2212 1 : j \u2265 0}, ai = \u0101i = bi = ci (\u03b1)\n\n\fFran\u00e7ois Blanchard, Fabien Durand, Alejandro Maass\n\n17\n\nfor i \u2208 {nj \u2212 1 : j > 0}, ai = \u0101i = 1, bi = 0\nfor i = 0, a0 = 1, \u01010 = b0 = 0.\nProof. If i \u2208\n/ {n0 \u2212 1, n1 \u2212 1, ...} then ci is continuous at \u03b1. If a sequence (tk )k\u2208N\napproaches \u03b1 then (ci (tk ))k\u2208N approaches ci (\u03b1) for such i. If (tk )k\u2208N approaches\n\u03b1 from below then it lies in the complement of K and so c0 (tk ) = 0 for all k \u2208 N.\nn \u22121\nFor i = nj \u2212 1 with j > 0 the fractional part of (R\u03b1j (tk ))k\u2208N approaches {nj \u03b1}\nfrom below and so the rotated sequence is also eventually in the complement of K.\nHence ((tk , c(tk )))k\u2208N approaches z \u2212 . If (tk )k\u2208N approaches \u03b1 from above then for\nn \u22121\ni = nj \u2212 1 with j > 0 the sequence of the fractional parts of R\u03b1j (tk ), k \u2208 N,\napproaches {nj \u03b1} from above and so the rotated sequence eventually enters the\ninterval Ij . Hence, the limit of (ci (tk ))k\u2208N is 1 for such i's. Finally, for i = 0,\nobserve that \u03b1 is a limit point from above of points in K and of points in S \\ K.\nIf we choose a sequence (tk )k\u2208N with tk \u2208 K for all k \u2208 N then c0 (tk ) = 1 and the\nsequence ((tk , c(tk )))k\u2208N approaches z +1 . If instead we choose a sequence (tk )k\u2208N\nwith tk \u2208\n/ K for all k \u2208 N then c0 (tk ) = 0 and ((tk , c(tk )))k\u2208N approaches z +0 . Any\nsequence approaching \u03b1 has a subsequence of one of these three types. Hence, the\nfiber consists of the three points specified in the statement.\n\u0003\nSince (S, R\u03b1 ) is a distal system, a proximal pair of distinct points in Z must lie in\nthe same fiber of \u03c1.\nIt is clear that the pair of orbits which lie over the orbit of \u03b2 j is an asymptotic\npair for each j \u2265 1. There remain the three orbits which lie over the orbit of \u03b1.\nObviously, the pair (z +0 , z +1 ) is an asymptotic pair, while the pairs (z +0 , z \u2212 ) and\n(z +1 , z \u2212 ) are proximal pairs, but not asymptotic. Thus, the Li-Yorke set is the\ncountable collection consisting of the orbits of these two pairs.\nNow by Akin's remark (see the proof of Corollary 3.10) and the last discussion we\nconclude that (Z, T \u00d7 \u03c3) contains no strong Li\u2013Yorke pairs.\nAcknowledgments.
