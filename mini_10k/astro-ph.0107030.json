The core has a\nsteep spectral index and is likely due primarily to the AGN. The faint emission has a\npositive spectral index and is clearly due to extended dust in a patchy distribution out\nto a radius of \u223c 20 kpc from the nucleus. These observations have now revealed that a\nlarge quantity of dust, \u223c 6 \u00d7 107 M\u2299 , 2 orders of magnitude larger than that inferred\nfrom previous optical absorption measurements, exists in this galaxy. We estimate the\ntemperature of this dust to be \u223c 20 K (using an emissivity index of \u03b2 = 1.3) and the\ngas/dust ratio to be 360. These values are typical of spiral galaxies. The dust emission\ncorrelates spatially with the hot X\u2212ray emitting gas which may be due to collisional\nheating of broadly distributed dust by electrons.

However,\nrecent observations have begun to reveal large amounts of\ndust in some central galaxies. The existence of dust is inferred from a diverse set of observations, including the ratios\nof emission lines in optical filaments (Hu 1992; Donahue &\nVoit 1993; Crawford et al. 1999), dust lanes in optical images (e.g. McNamara, O'Connell & Sarazin 1996; Pinkney\net al. 1996), near infrared (NIR) imaging and spectroscopy\n(e.g. Krabbe et al. 2000; Donahue et al. 2000; Jaffe, Bremer,\n& van der Werf 2000), and X\u2212ray absorption (e.g. White et\nal. 1991; Allen & Fabian 1997; Arnaud & Mushotzsky 1998;\nAllen 2000).\nSearches at longer wavelengths have now also revealed\nemission from dust directly, especially cooler dust which may\nbe much more plentiful than the warmer components. The\nInfrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) detected several central cluster galaxies at 60 and 100 \u03bcm; Cox, Bregman, &\nSchombert (1995) find that \u223c 10% of central galaxies have\nfar infrared (FIR) emission, with dust masses of \u223c 107 M\u2299 .\nMore recently, Lester et al. (1995) have detected 100 \u03bcm\nemission from NGC 1275 with the Kuiper Airborne Observatory (KAO), and there have been Infrared Space Observac 2000 RAS\n\ntory (ISO) detections at 60\u2212200 \u03bcm of a few central galaxies\n(e.g. Hansen et al. 2000). Annis & Jewitt (1993) carried out\nan unsuccessful search for dust emission in 11 cooling flow\nclusters using the UKT-14 bolometer system on the James\nClerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT). More recently, however,\nEdge et al. (1999) have detected dust emission at 850 \u03bcm\nin two cooling flow clusters using the more sensitive Submillimetre Common-User Bolometer Array (SCUBA) camera.\nThe origin of the dust in central cluster galaxies is a\nmatter of some controversy. Central cluster galaxies live\nin complicated environments, with many at the centers\nof cluster cooling flows (e.g. Fabian 1994), and interactions/mergers may also be common. Dust in central cluster\ngalaxies may thus originate in several ways: from the cooling\nflow itself or in cold, dense clouds condensed from the flow;\nfrom ongoing star formation, perhaps initiated by the cooling flow; or from the merger of a gas/dust rich galaxy. Direct\ndetections of dust in central cluster galaxies, and good determinations of the dust properties (mass, temperature, and\ncorrelations with other components) will help enormously to\ndecide between these alternatives. For example, the bulk of\nthe dust in cooled gas clouds is expected to be quite cold\nwith T < 15K (e.g. Fabian, Johnstone, & Daines 1994; Johnstone, Fabian & Taylor 1998) [However, this conclusion is\ndisputed by O'Dea, Baum & Gallimore (1994) and Voit &\n\n\f2\n\nJudith A.Irwin et al.\n\nDonahue (1995), who claim minimum dust temperatures of\n\u223c 20 K.]\nThe very existence of dust in central cluster galaxies\nis in itself surprising, since any dust should be destroyed\nquickly by sputtering from X\u2212rays from the hot cluster gas,\non timescales \u2264 107 years (e.g. Draine & Salpeter 1979).\nEither the dust is shielded against sputtering (e.g. at the\ncenters of cold, dense molecular clouds), or the dust is replenished on similar timescales. This issue is discussed in\nmore detail in Sect. 4.2.\nNGC 1275 is a complex and fascinating object. It has\nbeen studied in virtually every waveband, including the optical (e.g. N\u00f8rgaard-Nielsen et al. 1993; McNamara et al.\n1996), NIR (e.g. Donahue et al. 2000; Krabbe et al. 2000)\nand far infrared (FIR) (Gear et al. 1985; Lester et al. 1995).\nIt has been classified as a Seyfert (Seyfert 1943) and has an\nactive galactic nucleus (AGN) in the form of the highly variable radio source 3C 84 (e.g. Pedlar et al. 1990). Minkowski\n(1957) discovered two distinct filamentary systems around\nNGC 1275. The low velocity system (LVS) has the same\nvelocity (\u223c 5300 km s\u22121 ) as that of NGC 1275 itself, and\nhas been studied in detail by several authors (e.g. Lynds\n1970; Hu et al. 1983; Caulet et al. 1992). The high velocity\nsystem (HVS) has a velocity \u223c 3000 km s\u22121 higher than\nNGC 1275 and consists of giant HII regions to the North\nand North-West of the galaxy center; it has generally been\nconcluded that the HVS is a late-type spiral galaxy. At\nleast part of the HVS is in front of the nucleus, as determined from HI absorption against the nuclear radio source\n(De Young, Roberts, & Saslaw 1973) and Ly\u03b1 absorption\n(Briggs, Snijders, & Boksenberg 1982). The HVS could be\nmerely a chance projection onto NGC 1275, but several authors have argued that the HVS is in fact colliding with\nNGC 1275 (e.g. Hu et al. 1983; Unger et al. 1990; Caulet et\nal. 1992; N\u00f8rgaard-Nielsen et al. 1993). Recent observations\nof gas at velocities intermediate between the LVS and HVS\nalso strongly argue for a physical connection between the\ntwo systems (Ferruit et al. 1998).\nIt has been known for some time that the Perseus cluster\nhosts a large cooling flow (e.g. Fabian et al. 1981); analysis of\nrecent Advanced Satellite for Cosmology and Astrophysics\n(ASCA) data show that the mass infall rate is \u223c 300 M\u2299\nyr\u22121 (Allen et al. 1999). R\u00f6ntgen Satellite (ROSAT) and\nChandra X\u2212ray observations of NGC 1275 and the Perseus\ncluster (B\u00f6hringer et al. 1993, and Fabian et al. 2000, respectively) have also revealed two holes in the NGC 1275\nX\u2212ray emission, thought to be caused by displacement of\nhot gas by the radio lobes. NGC 1275 is the only cooling\nflow central galaxy with detected CO emission, with an inferred molecular H2 mass of \u223c 1010 M\u2299 ; see Bridges & Irwin\n(1998) for a summary of the many previous CO studies.\nIn this paper, we present new SCUBA 450/850 \u03bcm data\nfor NGC 1275, in an attempt to study the cold dust in this\ngalaxy in more detail. We are especially interested in such\ndust properties as: its spatial distribution and correlation\nwith other components, total mass, temperature and ultimately, its origin. In Sect. 2, we present the observations and\ndata reductions, unprocessed and processed images, Sect. 3\npresents the results, including an analysis of the AGN and\nextended dust components, separately, and correlations with\nother wavebands, Sect. 4 discusses the origin of the dust\nand dust heating, and Sect. 5 presents the conclusions. For\n\nNGC 1275, we take D = 70 Mpc (H0 = 75 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 ,\nBridges & Irwin 1998).\n\n2\n2.1\n\nOBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION\nMaps of NGC 1275\n\nTable 1 lists the observing log of SCUBA jiggle maps obtained on July 15, October 31 and December 14 1998. The\ntotal observation time was 5.5 hours, half of which was spent\non the source. Chopping was performed in Azimuth, with a\nchop thow of 120 arcseconds.\nThe standard reduction scheme for SCUBA jiggle maps\nwas followed, consisting of flatfielding, correction for atmospheric extinction, removal of noisy bolometers, sky noise\nremoval and despiking. These steps are described in detail in Sandell (1997). Flatfielding corrects for differences\nin sensitivity of the bolometers. The atmospheric opacity at\n450 and 850 \u03bcm was determined from skydip observations.\nNoisy bolometers were identified from noise measurements\nperformed in between observations, and visual inspection of\nthe signal of all bolometers as a function of time during the\nobservations.\nVariations of the sky brightness are not canceled out\ncompletely by chopping because the atmosphere in the direction of the chopped beam is significantly different from\nthe atmosphere in the direction of the source. This is a particular concern for observations of an extended source, where\na large chop throw is required (Holland et al. 1999). Variations of the sky on short time scales were further eliminated\nby subtracting the median sky level measured by off-source\nbolometers for each 18 second integration. Although the sky\nlevel is determined with higher accuracy if more bolometers\nare considered, the likelihood that faint extended emission\nof the source is also subtracted, increases as well. A compromise must be sought between decreasing the sky noise and\nthe possibility of subtracting source emission. The sky level\nwas determined from the outer two rings of bolometers at\n450 \u03bcm, and the single outer ring of bolometers at 850 \u03bcm.\nIn this way a significant aperture around the centre of the\nfield of view is excluded from the determination of the sky\nlevel. The radius of the aperture which is never covered by\nany of the \"sky\"-bolometers is 28\u2032\u2032 at 450 \u03bcm and 46\u2032\u2032 at 850\n\u03bcm. As the sky level at any time is taken to be the median\nof a ring of 54 (450 \u03bcm) or 18 (850 \u03bcm) bolometers surrounding the source, only a smooth symmetric component\nwould be subtracted in this way.\nOccasional spikes in the output of each bolometer were\nthen removed by excluding signals deviating more than \u00b13\u03c3\nfrom the mean signal.\nThe data were averaged with weight factors wi =\n(ti /Ni )2 where ti and Ni are the integration time and\nnoise level of observation i, to produce the maps shown in\nFig. 1. These weight factors take into account both the different integration times and atmospheric opacities of the\nobservations, since the noise in each map is dominated\nby the sky. The relative weights of the three nights are\nJuly:October:December=0.48:1:0.64.\nRecently, a potential calibration problem resulting from\nerroneous\nvalues\nof the hot and cold load temperatures was identified (see\nc 2000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201313\n\n\fSCUBA Observations of NGC 1275\nhttp://www.jach.hawaii.edu/JACdocs/JCMT/SCD/SN/002/\ntau analysis.html). This problem could affect the sky\nopacity derived from skydip observations. The calibration\nwas repeated with opacities calculated from the CSO opacity and the revised relations for the opacities at 450\u03bcm and\n850\u03bcm. We found that this procedure had no effect on our\ncalibration.\nTaking into account the repeatability of the flux determination over a variety of integration times as well as an\nassessment of the accuracy of the calibration factor including uncertainties in the calibrator fluxes, we estimate that\nthe 450\u03bcm calibration error is \u223c 25% and the 850\u03bcm error is\n\u223c 10%. Typical pointing corrections were 1 to 2 arcseconds\nover the course of an hour and residual pointing errors will\nbe smaller than this.\nThe corrected, calibrated maps are shown in Fig. 1a\n(450\u03bcm) and Fig. 1c (850\u03bcm).\n2.2\n\nBeam maps\n\nBeam maps were constructed for each night from calibrator\nmaps with the same chop throw that was applied to the observations of NGC 1275. These calibrator maps were reduced\nin the same way as the observations of NGC 1275, with\none exception: noisy bolometers were not excluded from the\nanalysis. This was done to avoid the occurrence of unsampled areas in the planet maps. However no significant noise\nwas introduced, because at 850\u03bcm the primary calibrators\nMars and Uranus are brighter than NGC 1275 by factors\nof 300 and 60 respectively. At 450\u03bcm these factors are even\nlarger because the brightness of the planets rises, whereas\nthe spectrum of NGC 1275 shows a decline with frequency.\nTherefore, it is safe to conclude that noisy bolometers in the\nbeam maps do not affect our results.\nCalibrator sources are Uranus, Mars, CRL 618, and\nHL Tau. We used planet maps made with the same chop\nthrow as the NGC 1275 maps, to define the shape of the\nbeam for each night. Only for the 450\u03bcm map in December,\nwe used the secondary calibrator CRL 618, as no 450\u03bcm\nplanet map with the appropriate chop throw was available. The calibration factors adopted here are those determined for the October observations: 623.69 Jy/(Volt beam)\nat 450\u03bcm and 251.54 Jy/(Volt beam) at 850 \u03bcm. Our largest\ncalibrator was Mars which was smaller than 5\u2032\u2032 over the\ncourse of the observations. This broadens the beam by less\nthan 0.3\u2032\u2032 at 850\u03bcm and by less than 0.6\u2032\u2032 at 450\u03bcm, or <\n1.8% and < 6.7% of the beam size, respectively (see caption\nto Figure 2 for the fitted beam size). Thus, the finite size of\nthe calibrators will not significantly affect the beam, or its\nfar sidelobes.\nThe coordinate system for the beam maps produced in\nthis way was azimuth-elevation because chopping was done\nin azimuth, and the beam tends to be slightly elongated in\nthe direction of chopping. For each observation of NGC 1275,\nthe appropriate beam map was shifted to the position of the\npeak in the final map of NGC 1275, and rotated with the\nfield rotation angle at the time of mid-observation. The resulting beam maps were coadded with the same weight factors as the data for NGC 1275 (see Sect. 2.1) to construct\na map of the effective beam. The beam maps are shown\nin Fig. 1b and d.

Observation log for SCUBA 450/850 \u03bcm observations\nof NGC 1275.\n\nNGC 1275 and the final beam map, can be identified with\nthe chop direction of the October 31 observation, which received a relatively high weight due to the favourable atmospheric conditions.\nThe resulting beam maps (Fig. 1b and d) give the best\npossible representation of the JCMT beam applicable to the\ncoadded maps of NGC 1275. As only one calibrator observation with the correct chop throw was made in a night, we\ncannot correct for variations of the error lobes during the\nnight. The main source of such variations is the sensitivity\nof the structure of the telescope to temperature variations.\nLarge changes in the structure of the error lobes have been\nreported in the early evening (until 9pm) and in late morning (after 8am). However, only one observation, the 850\u03bcm\nbeam map of December 14, was made outside the relatively\nstable window between 9pm and 8am.\n\n2.3\n\nProcessed Images\n\nThe beam shape begins to show irregular, non-gaussian\npatterns below the 5% level and it is desirable to remove\nsuch features from the total intensity image in order to see\nwhether real residual emission remains. We attempted to do\nthis by subtracting the scaled beam from the image; however, this assumes that the strong central source due to the\nAGN is strictly a point source and the result leaves some\nsignificant residual emission at the map center. We therefore treated the image like a typical radio map and applied\ndeconvolution methods to remove the \"dirty beam\" and replace it with a \"clean beam\" with the same characteristics.\nThe resulting maps retain the information from both the\nstrong central source as well as any fainter extended emission, while removing the low level beam irregularities. Results using the CLEAN algorithm (Clark 1980), using the\nAstronomical Image Processing System (AIPS) routine, APCLN, are shown in Fig. 2a (450\u03bcm) and Fig. 2d (850\u03bcm) and\nresults using the maximum entropy (ME) method (Cornwell\n& Evans 1985) using the AIPS routine, VTESS, are shown\nin Fig. 2b and Fig. 2e. A comparison of these maps provides an indication as to what emission is real. As the ME\nmaps are well known to enhance faint, broad-scale structure\nbut are less accurate than the clean maps in characterizing\nthe emission quantitatively, we use the clean maps for all\nsubsequent quantitative work.\nResidual maps, i.e. after subtraction of all clean components, are shown in Fig. 2c and f. For these images, we\n\n\f4\n\nJudith A.Irwin et al.\n\nFigure 1. Maps of NGC 1275 and the coadded beam maps at 450\u03bcm (top row) and 850\u03bcm (bottom row).

The contours and grayscales in the beam maps represent the same percentiles of the peak\nintensity as in the corresponding maps of NGC 1275.\n\nshow both negative and positive contours so that the noise\nis well illustrated. Since all subtracted clean components\nare associated with the central bright core, the residual\nmaps represent core-subtracted emission. At 450 \u03bcm, the\ncore-subtracted map is dominated by noise which is about\n10 times higher than that of the 850\u03bcm map (see figure\ncaption). At 850\u03bcm (Fig. 2f), the noise is much lower, so\nsome additional errors associated with subtracting the central source also show up, the largest of which are within the\ncentral 30\u2032\u2032 region. Since positive residual emission could be\nreal, we take the negative residual emission in this region to\nrepresent the errors from the subtraction process. Applying\na 2\u03c3 cutoff to the core-subtracted and total intensity maps,\nwe formed a ratio map to indicate the relative error in this\nregion, finding an average error of 3.0% and a maximum\nerror of 6.7%.\nIs the resulting emission due to continuum alone?\n\nBridges & Irwin (1998) have detected CO(J=3-2) emission\nin NGC 1275 at points within \u00b1 7\u2032\u2032 of the core. Their\nCO(J=3-2) beam of 14\u2032\u2032 is similar to our SCUBA 850\u03bcm\nbeam of 16\u2032\u2032 . The CO line occurs at a redshifted frequency of\n339.9 GHz and is therefore within the 30 GHz-wide SCUBA\nband which is centered at 347 GHz. Bridges & Irwin find\nan integrated intensity of 12 K km s\u22121 which corresponds\nto 8.6 mJy beam\u22121 when diluted by the 30 GHz bandwidth\n(assuming constant response across the band). The value\nwill be smaller when the bandpass response is considered\n(see Holland et al. 1999). This corresponds to only 0.6% of\nthe SCUBA flux of 1.42 Jy within a 16\u2032\u2032 beam and is well\nwithin the noise. Thus, there is no contamination by the CO\nline at the core and we do not expect any contamination at\nlocations away from the core, either, where no CO emission\nhas been detected.\n\nc 2000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201313\n\n\fSCUBA Observations of NGC 1275\n\n5\n\nFigure 2.

Since the core is quite prominent in the\nprocessed maps, it has been possible to separate it from the\nextended emission and results from this process, along with\ntotal fluxes and the spectral index, are given in Table 2.\n\n3.1\n\nThe AGN\n\nThe bright AGN in NGC 1275 has shown a gradual decline\nof a factor 4 in brightness at 375 GHz (800 \u03bcm) between\n1988 and 1992 (Stevens et al. 1994), providing compelling\nevidence for the non-thermal nature of this emission. From\nour data, there is no indication for variability between the\nthree epochs of the present SCUBA observations to the level\nc 2000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201313\n\nof the calibration error, or about 6%. Moreover, our measured 1998 total flux at 850 \u03bc of 1.6 Jy agrees closely with\nthe 800\u03bcm flux of \u223c 1.6 Jy measured by Stevens et al. (from\ntheir Fig. 2) in 1994. Thus, the strong decline seen before\n1994 does not appear to have continued over the 4 years\nbetween 1994 and 1998.\nThe core is 1.8 times brighter at 850\u03bcm than at 450\u03bcm,\nresulting in a spectral index (Table 2) of \u03b1 = -0.88 \u00b1 0.09\n(S\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u03b1 ). This agrees with the value found by Stevens et\nal. (1994) of \u03b1 = -0.92 \u00b1 0.17 between 375 and 150 GHz\nover a 6 year monitoring period. Such a steep spectral index can be produced from synchrotron emission. Thus we\nare likely observing the high frequency extension of the synchrotron emission seen at lower frequencies. It is not possible\nto extrapolate the low frequency radio flux to the sum-mm\nbecause of the variability of the source over the different\nepochs of observation. However, since the low frequency (i.e.\n\n\f6\n\nJudith A.Irwin et al.\nTable 2.

Errors associated with varying the\nbox size to include or exlude low S/N peaks at larger radii are smaller than this.\nb The core parameters were derived from gaussian fits to the core component alone, averaging results from\nfits to the total intensity maps as well as the map of the core alone which was reconstructured from the\nclean components. The errors include differences between the maps and, in the case of the flux, differences\nbetween values measured from integration of the core map, and values determined by the gaussian fit to the\ncore. Note that the calibration error and the pointing error (< 1 arcsecond) are not included in these quoted\nerrors.\nc A dash means unresolved.\nd S \u221d \u03bd\u03b1\n\u03bd\n\nbetween \u03bb90 cm and \u03bb199 cm) spectral index within the central 1 arcminute region is dominated by a flat spectral index\ncore (see Pedlar et al. 1990), the total synchrotron spectral\nindex must turn over between the low frequency and submm regimes. Given the steepness of the sub-mm spectrum,\nthere is no need to postulate the presence of a dust component in the core at any significant level. A similar conclusion\nis reached by Leeuw, Samson & Robson (2000) for the elliptical galaxy, NGC 4374, in which sub-mm emission from\nthe AGN core is detected. Note that this does not, by itself,\nrule out the possibility of some dust in the core. Indeed, the\npresence of CO emission at the position of the core (Bridges\n& Irwin 1998, Reuter et al. 1993) suggests that dust is also\npresent there. However, the core is unlikely to be dominated\nby dust emission or else the core spectral index would be significantly flatter or inverted. The sub-mm core is unresolved\nat 850\u03bcm but has a (deconvolved) size of \u223c 4\u2032\u2032 at 450\u03bcm.\nIf we use the core spectral index and extrapolate the\ncore flux to 100\u03bcm, we find a 100\u03bcm core flux of 0.22 Jy.\nThis is within the error bar of the total 100\u03bcm flux of 7.9 \u00b1\n1 Jy measured by Lester et al.(1995) and suggests that the\nnonthermal core is a negligible contributor to the total flux\nat 100\u03bcm. Thus, the 100\u03bcm total flux (7.9 Jy) can be interpreted as being entirely due to dust emission. This agrees\nwith Lester et al.'s conclusion that less than 20% of the total 100\u03bcm emission can be due to the nonthermal core based\non the known variability of the core and the constancy of\nthe 100\u03bcm flux. Thus, the total emission changes from being non-thermal core-dominated to dust-dominated between\n450\u03bcm and 100\u03bcm.\n\n3.2\n\nExtended Emission\n\nThe extended sub-mm emission is much fainter than that\nassociated with the core, but is seen at both frequencies\nand appears to be real. The clean and maximum entropy\nmaps also show good agreement although there are some\ndifferences at low contour levels in the 850\u03bcm maps. Single\nepoch maps were also cleaned to confirm that the extended\nemission is present at all epochs to a level that is consistent\nwith the shorter integration time per epoch and higher atmospheric opacity in the July 15 observations. The extended\nemission constitutes \u223c 33% of the total flux at 450\u03bcm and\n\u223c 11% of the total flux at 850\u03bcm.\nThe 450\u03bcm core-subtracted map (Fig. 2c) has a much\nhigher noise level than the 850\u03bcm map, but does show several features which remain upon smoothing to lower resolution and which also have counterparts in the 850\u03bcm map.\nThe principle one is an elongated feature to the west of\nthe core extending northwards. This will be referred to as\nthe NW extension. Secondly, there are some residual peaks\nabout 45\u2032\u2032 to the south-east of the core which again have a\ncounterpart in the 850\u03bcm map. We will refer to this region\nas the SE peak. Another peak about 1\u2032 to the south-west\ncould possibly be real, but this is not certain given its offset\nfrom a nearby 850\u03bcm peak.\nExtended emission is most readily seen in the lower\nnoise 850\u03bcm maps (Fig. 2d, e, and f). These show further\nextensions to both the east and west and \"disconnected\"\nfeatures elsewhere which appear to be real, given their presence in each frame. A fairly strong feature near the core is\nalso seen to extend \u223c 30\u2032\u2032 to the south-west. This latter feature also appears to be real, though may contain a relatively\nlarger error, given its proximity to the core.\nThe spectral index of the total emission (Table 2) is\nflatter than that of the dominant core alone, suggesting that\nc 2000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201313\n\n\fSCUBA Observations of NGC 1275\nthe spectral index of the faint extended emission may have\nan inverted (positive) spectral index. Indeed, we could measure this spectral index in two positions, the NW extension\nand the SE peak, by first smoothing the 450\u03bcm map to the\n850\u03bcm resolution. For the NW extension, flux measurements\nwere made within a 6\u2032\u2032 diameter region centered at RA =\n03h 19m 45 s. 79, DEC = 41\u25e6 30\u2032 57 \u2032\u2032. 3, with the resulting\nspectral index found to be \u03b1 = +2.6. For the SE peak, the\nmeasurement was made within a 6\u2032\u2032 diameter region centered\nat RA = 03h 19m 49 s. 17, DEC = 41\u25e6 30\u2032 00 \u2032\u2032. 3, and found\nto be \u03b1 = +2.8. Thus, where the spectral index could be\nmeasured, the values are strongly positive. These are clearly\ndust components.\n\n3.2.1\n\nDust Temperature\n\nDust is expected to be optically thin at sub-mm wavelengths, and the temperature can, in principle, be determined via S\u03bd = \u03a9 B\u03bd (T ) Q(\u03bd) (e.g. Stevens & Gear 2000),\nwhere S\u03bd is the flux density at frequency, \u03bd, \u03a9 is the solid\nangle subtended by the dust, B\u03bd (T ) is the Planck function applicable to a dust temperature, T , and Q(\u03bd) is the\nfrequency-dependent emissivity of the grains. In the optically thin limit, Q(\u03bd) = ( \u03bd\u03bd0 )\u03b2 , where \u03b2 is the index of the\nemissivity law and \u03bd0 is the frequency at which the dust\nbecomes optically thin. If we restrict the dust temperature\ndetermination for NGC 1275 to regions for which fluxes are\navailable at both frequencies (here, taking the NW extension), and assume that the covering factor is the same at\nthe two frequencies, we can estimate a temperature, adopting a value for the unknown emissivity index, \u03b2. Taking \u03b2 =\n1.3 as was found for M 82 (Hughes, Gear, & Robson 1994;\nsee also Leeuw et al. 2000), we find a dust temperature of\n19 K. For \u03b2 = 2 (e.g. Domingue et al. 1999), we find T =\n11 K and if \u03b2 = 1 (Lester et al. 1995), T = 29 K. Thus, for\nreasonable values of \u03b2, the dust temperature is constrained\nfrom these observations to be between 10 and 30 K.\nWhile most other flux measurements of NGC 1275 have\nincluded the non-thermal core flux, we have noted (Sect. 3.1)\nthat the core is a negligible contributor to the total 100\u03bcm\nflux. Thus, the 100\u03bcm point should represent dust emission\nand can also be used to constrain the dust temperature. If\nwe include the 100\u03bcm flux (7.9 Jy, Lester et al. 1995) in this\nanalysis, however, we find that the observed flux ratios cannot be reproduced within error bars using single values of\n\u03a9, \u03b2 and T. This suggests that (at least) a two component\nmodel is required. For \u03b2 = 1.3, the 100\u03bcm/450\u03bcm ratio implies a temperature of 38 K in comparison to 19 K found\nfrom the 450\u03bcm/850\u03bcm value. Differences in \u03b2 or \u03a9 are also\npossible. However, we note that there is some evidence for\na two-temperature model from a line ratio analysis of the\nmolecular gas as well (Bridges & Irwin 1998). We suspect\nthat dust that is near the non-thermal core may be warmer.\n\n3.2.2\n\nDust Mass and Gas-to-Dust Ratio\n\nThe dust mass is determined via Md = S\u03bd D2 /[kd \u03bd B\u03bd (T )],\nwhere D is the distance to the galaxy and kd\u03bd is the dust\nmass absorption coefficient. We will determine the dust mass\nusing the 850\u03bcm flux. This is because it has typically been\nfound (e.g. Alton et al. 2000) that over 90% of observed\nc 2000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201313\n\n7\n\n850\u03bcm emission arises from cold ( <\n\u223c 20 K) dust, (consistent\nwith our best temperature estimate of 19 K) and this cold\ncomponent constitutes the bulk of galactic dust. Moreover,\nthe lower noise in the 850\u03bcm images makes this a better\nchoice for such a calculation. The value of kd\u03bd is rather uncertain and has the same frequency dependence as Q(\u03bd).\nAgain, adopting \u03b2 = 1.3 and extrapolating the mass absorption coefficient from the 100\u03bcm value of 2.5 m2 kg \u22121\n(Stevens & Gear 2000) yields kd\u03bd = 0.15 m2 kg \u22121 . (This is\na factor of 2 higher than the value used by Dunne et al.\n2000 for their determination of dust mass functions in the\nlocal universe.) Applying a dust temperature of 20 K and\nusing S\u03bd = 0.18 Jy (after core subtraction, see Table 2), we\nfind a dust mass of Md = 5.9 \u00d7 107 M\u2299 . A temperature of\n40 K would lower this by a factor of 2.5, using \u03b2 = 2 would\nincrease it by a factor of 4.5, and using the noisier 450\u03bcm\n(rather than 850\u03bcm) data would lower it by a factor of 2.6.\nThus our best estimate of the dust mass is 6 \u00d7 107 M\u2299 to\nwithin a factor of a few. This is the first estimate of the\ndust mass in this galaxy from spatially resolved emission\nmeasurements which correct for the AGN.\nThis result can be compared with the much lower dust\nmass of 7.5 \u00d7 105 M\u2299 (adjusted to our distance) found for\nNGC 1275 by Goudfrooij et al. (1994) using optical absorption measurements. The absorbing dust is confined to\na much smaller patchy region to the north-west of the core\n(Fig. 3f) and constitutes only 1.3% of the total dust mass\nas determined from our 850\u03bcm measurements. Discrepancies between the absorbing and emitting dust masses have\nbeen noted by Goudfrooij & de Jong (1995) who suggested\nthat the differences could be due to additional dust which\nis distributed more broadly than in front of the stellar light\ndistribution alone. Our dust mass and the extended dust\ndistribution seen at 850\u03bcm clearly support this view and indicate that there is much more dust in NGC 1275 seen in\nemission than previously determined from absorption measurements.\nGoudfrooij & de Jong (1995) have determined dust\nmasses for 56 Shapley-Ames elliptical galaxies from IRAS\nobservations, finding dust masses in the range, 104 to 5 \u00d7\n106 M\u2299 . Bregman et al. (1998) have also found IRAS dust\nmasses in the same range for E and S0 galaxies. NGC 1275,\ntherefore, has a higher dust mass, by about an order of\nmagnitude, than the other early-type galaxies studied by\nthese authors. However, it is well known that IRAS observations sample somewhat warmer dust than SCUBA and\nmay thereby overestimate the dust temperature, underestimating the resulting mass (Dunne et al. 2000). Therefore\nthe discrepancy between the high dust mass in NGC 1275\nand the lower dust masses in E and S0 galaxies may not\nbe as high as an order of magnitude. Also, these galaxies\nare typically not in a cooling flow environment. Fewer previous measurements have been made of central cooling flow\ngalaxies. Edge et al. (1999), however, find masses between\n3 to 5 \u00d7 107 M\u2299 for A1835 and A2390 (adjusting to H0 =\n75 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 ), in closer agreement with our value for\nNGC 1275.\nArmed with these data, we can compute a global\ngas/dust ratio. For the molecular gas mass, we use 1.6 \u00d7\n1010 M\u2299 (Bridges & Irwin 1998) which uses the Galactic\nCO to H2 conversion factor, and for the atomic hydrogen\nmass, we use the value found for the low velocity system\n\n\f8\n\nJudith A.Irwin et al.\n333 MHz over Sub-mm\n\nHalpha over Sub-mm\n\n(Core-subtracted)\n\n(Core-subtracted)\n\nLVS-HVS\n\n41 31 30\n15\n00\n\nDECLINATION (J2000)\n\n30 45\n30\n15\n00\n29 45\n41 31 30\n\n(e)\n(a)\n\n(b)\nA_V\n\n15\n00\n30 45\n30\n15\n00\n\n(f)\n(c)\n\n29 45\n03 19 52\n\n(d)\n\n50\n\n48\n\n46\n\n44\n\n52\n\n50\n\n48\n\n46\n\n44\n\nRIGHT ASCENSION (J2000)\nFigure 3.

This is higher than typical Galactic values of\n100 to 150 (Devereux & Young 1990) but is consistent with\nwhat has been found for radio quiet quasars, spiral galaxies,\nand ultraluminous infra-red galaxies (\u2248 260 to 540; Hughes\net al. 1993).\n\n3.3\n\nCorrelations with other Wavebands\n\nFigure 3 shows overlays of the core-subtracted sub-mm maps\n(in greyscale, 450\u03bcm at top and 850\u03bcm at bottom) with\nemission at other wavebands. Note that by subtracting the\ncore, we cannot compare emission features within the central \u2248 20\u2032\u2032 diameter region. Overlays are with the 333 MHz\nradio continuum emission (Fig. 3a, c) which traces the nonthermal component, and with the H\u03b1 low velocity system\n(Fig. 3b, d) which presumably traces condensing cooling\nflow gas. For comparison, the high velocity system, associated with the infalling galaxy (Sect. 1), is shown as greyscale\n\nwith the LVS contours in Fig. 3e and the optical absorption\nis shown in Fig. 3f.\nThe dust emission shows some weak correlations with\nthe 333 MHz map. For example, the sub-mm NW extension\noccurs along the outer ridge of the radio continuum emission.\nThere is also weak sub-mm emission just where the radio\ncontinuum emission falls off about 1 arcminute SW of the\nnucleus. A ridge of weak radio continuum emission extending\nfrom RA = 3h 19m 52s , DEC = 41\u25e6 30\u2032 55\u2032\u2032 to RA = 3h 19m\n49s , DEC = 41\u25e6 29\u2032 50\u2032\u2032 is also seen in the sub-mm.\nThere is no obvious correlation between the LVS H\u03b1\nemission and the sub-mm maps other than a possible one\nbetween the NW extension and an H\u03b1 extension at 450\u03bcm\n(Fig. 3b). The HVS H\u03b1 emission (Fig. 3e) occurs in a patchy\ndistribution mainly to the NW of and near the nucleus.\nAgain, there is no clear correlation between the sub-mm\nemission and high velocity H\u03b1 system other than some correspondence in the same NW extension region. The optical\nextinction map (see Fig. 3f) does show several knots which\ncorrespond to enhanced 450\u03bcm or 850\u03bcm emission, suggesting that this dust is in the foreground. N\u00f8rgaard-Nielsen et\nal. (1993) and McNamara et al. (1996) have argued that\nc 2000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201313\n\n\fSCUBA Observations of NGC 1275\nsome of the dust, as observed in optical extinction, corresponds to the intervening (HVS) galaxy.\nWe have also investigated whether the CO emission\n(not shown) resembles the sub-mm, since normally dust\nand molecular gas follow similar distributions. CO has been\nmapped with similar resolution as the sub-mm by Bridges\n& Irwin (1998) and Reuter et al. (1993); however, the most\nwide-scale mapping has been out to a radius of only \u223c 30\u2032\u2032\nand little structure is visible in existing CO maps. Bridges\n& Irwin do find a bend in the CO contours to the southwest, similar to the bright 850\u03bcm emission in that direction.\nMuch higher resolution CO mapping, which cannot be directly compared to our sub-mm distribution due to the core\nsubtraction and difference in resolution, shows an east-west\nstructure similar to the LVS (see Inoue et al. 1996).\nFigure 4 shows the 850\u03bcm core-subtracted map superimposed on a colour image of the ROSAT HRI X\u2212ray emission which shows a deficit of X\u2212ray flux at the positions\nof the radio lobes. This morphology has been interpreted as\na displacement of the thermal gas by the outflowing radio\nlobes (B\u00f6hringer et al. 1993, Churazov et al. 2000). Fig. 4\nshows the best correlation we have found with the sub-mm\nand helps to explain the partial correlation found between\ndust and the radio continuum (see above) since there is a\nrelationship between the radio continuum and X\u2212ray emission. The brightest X\u2212ray emission occurs in a ridge which\nextends from the east of the nucleus and curves to the south.\nThis is also roughly where a weak radio continuum ridge\noccurs (as pointed out above). The 850\u03bcm emission approximately follows this curved ridge (cf. the \"filled in\" emission\nin the ME map, Fig. 2e also) although the peaks don't exactly coincide. For example, dust emission curves around\nthe X\u2212ray peak at RA = 3h 19m 50 s. 5, DEC = 41\u25e6 30\u2032\n15\u2032\u2032 . The bright sub-mm extension to the SW of the nucleus truncates abruptly just where the X\u2212ray emission also\ndrops about 30\u2032\u2032 from the nucleus; this is where the SW radio lobe occurs. To the west of the nucleus, both X\u2212ray\nand dust emission show an extension to \u223c 50 arcseconds,\nboth ending at roughly the same position. The NW extension correlates well with an X\u2212ray peak on the NW side of\nthe galaxy with the sub-mm peak slightly displaced to the\nNW of the X\u2212ray peak. Even some of the the very faint submm emission which we at first considered to be noise bears\nsome resemblance to the X\u2212ray. For example, to the north\nof the nucleus, the northern X\u2212ray arc has several 850\u03bcm\npeaks occurring along its northern edge about 45\u2032\u2032 from the\nnucleus. About 1 arcminute from the nucleus to the NNW,\nweaker X\u2212ray emission falls off and again, weak peaks of\n850\u03bcm emission can be seen there.\nRecent observations by the Chandra satellite (Fabian\net al. 2000) confirm the general characteristics of the X\u2212ray\nmap shown in Figure 4. One improvement is in the clearer\nview of an X-ray absorption feature \u223c 40\u2032\u2032 NW of the nucleus which is seen as a small arc just to the west of the\nbrightest X-ray ridge on the NW side of the nucleus (see\nthe low X-ray emission at RA \u223c 3h 19m 45s , DEC \u223c 41\u25e6\n30\u2032 47\u2032\u2032 ). This absorption feature appears to \"wrap around\"\non the west side of the brightest X-ray/sub-mm peak NW\nof the nucleus and so suggests that there may be some relation between the dust and the infalling galaxy. However,\nwe do not see enhanced sub-mm emission where the X-ray\nabsorption occurs. This suggests that the feature which is\nc 2000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201313\n\n9\n\nproducing the X-ray absorption includes some component\nother than dust and/or that the characteristics of the absorbing dust are such that we are not clearly detecting it at\n450\u03bcm or 850\u03bcm.\nIn summary, we find that the sub-mm dust emission\ncorrelates spatially with the X\u2212ray emission, except that\nthere may be offsets between the X-ray peaks and sub-mm\npeaks (for example, the strongest X\u2212ray peak does not have\na counterpart in the sub-mm).\n\n4\n4.1\n\nDISCUSSION\nSource of Dust Heating\n\nFrom these SCUBA data, we have estimated a dust temperature to be \u223c 20 K. What are the possible heating sources\nfor this dust? The possibilities include heating by stellar\nphotons, heating by hot electrons in X\u2212ray emitting gas,\ndirect heating by X\u2212rays, and heating by the AGN.\nSince dust emission is observed to a distance of \u223c 1\narcminute = 20 kpc from the AGN in NGC 1275, we can rule\nout AGN heating as a possible source for this extended dust.\nRigopoulou, Lawrence, & Rowan-Robinson (1996) have also\nlooked at the submillimetre and X\u2212ray data from a number\nof ultraluminous infra-red galaxies and found that most are\nwell-fitted by a standard model of stellar heating, even when\nthere is evidence for an AGN. Also, since the 450\u03bcm/850\u03bcm\nspectral index of the dust emission is the same for dust in\nthe NW extension (measured \u223c 6 kpc from the nucleus) as\nfor dust at 15 kpc, there is no need to postulate different\nheating sources for the extended dust at these frequencies.\nGoudfrooij & de Jong (1995) have considered the other\nheating mechanisms for elliptical galaxies and conclude that\ndirect heating by X\u2212rays is not feasible. This leaves heating by stellar photons and heating by hot electrons as the\nremaining viable mechanisms. McNamara et al. (1996) have\nfound a faint blue continuum extending out to \u223c 30 kpc\n(1.5 arcminutes) in NGC 1275 along the filamentary H\u03b1 system, indicating that stars do indeed exist to large distances.\nHowever, the close resemblance of the sub-mm continuum in\nNGC 1275 to the X\u2212ray structure and the apparent absence\nof a large population of stars more massive than \u223c 5 M\u2299\n(Sarazin & O'Connell 1983, Smith et al. 1992, McNamara et\nal. 1996) points to hot electrons as the source of dust heating\nin NGC 1275. Lester et al. (1995) have also shown quantitatively, that hot electrons in NGC 1275 are energetically\ncapable of supplying the dust heating in this galaxy. The\nfact that the 850\u03bcm emission avoids the brightest X\u2212ray\npeak suggests that dust may be more rapidly destroyed in\nthis region.\n\n4.2\n\nOrigin of the Dust\n\nThese observations have shown that extended dust exists in\nNGC 1275 to very large distances from the core (\u223c 20 kpc)\nand that the total dust mass is high, i.e. 6 \u00d7 107 M\u2299 , two\norders of magnitude larger than that inferred from optical\nabsorption studies. As indicated in Sect. 1, three possibilities\nfor the origin of the dust present themselves: from the cooling flow or in dense clouds associated with the flow, from\n\n\f10\n\nJudith A.Irwin et al.\n\nongoing star formation, or from the merger of a gas/dust\nrich galaxy. Let us consider these possibilities.\nIf dust is mixed with the cooling flow gas, then its lifetime against destruction by sputtering is found from td =\n2 \u00d7 104 (cm\u22123 /n)(a/0.01\u03bcm), where n is the density of the\nhot cooling flow gas and a is the grain radius (Draine &\nSalpeter 1979). The grain size is uncertain, but a reasonable\nupper limit is 0.1 micron (cf. Lester et al. 1995), and the hot\ngas density near the center of NGC 1275 is 0.05 - 0.1 cm\u22123\n(e.g. Fabian et al. 2000). This gives td = 2 - 4 \u00d7 106 years.\nThus, dust will be destroyed on short timescales if it is mixed\nwith the hot gas and there must be a source of dust replenishment. The alternative is that dust is somehow shielded\nfrom the X\u2212ray environment, possibly in dense molecular\nclouds for which there is (as yet) no observational evidence.\nIf stellar mass loss is continuously replenishing the dust,\nwe would expect this dust to be ejected and dispersed into\nthe X\u2212ray emitting environment, suggesting that the short\nlifetime determined above should be relevant. Determining\na dust mass loss rate from stars is not straightforward and\ninvolves a knowledge of the initial mass function, the mass\nloss rates from stars, and the gas/dust ratio in the ejected\nmaterial. For NGC 1275, there currently appear to be no\nstars more massive than 5 M\u2299 and, if more massive stars\nhave been produced in the past, this past massive star formation must have ceased 70 Myr ago or more (Smith et al.\n1992). Since this is longer than the lifetime of dust in the\nX-ray emitting environment, we do not expect young, massive O type stars to contribute to the currently observed\ndust in NGC 1275. The next strongest source of mass loss,\nand that which will dominate in NGC 1275, comes from the\nolder, more evolved stellar population. The remaining main\nsequence stars of 5 M\u2299 or less contribute negligibly to global\nmass loss rates (see Snow 1982).\nBoth Faber & Gallagher (1976) and Knapp, Gunn\n& Wynn-Williams (1992) have estimated, through independent means, mass-loss rates for an evolved population of stars. Knapp et al. find \u1e40 = 2.1 \u00d7\n10\u221212 (L2.2\u03bcm /L\u2299 ) M\u2299 yr \u22121 and Faber & Gallagher find\n\u1e40 = 1.5 \u00d7 10\u221211 (LB /L\u2299 ) M\u2299 yr \u22121 , where L2.2\u03bcm and\nLB are, respectively, the 2.2\u03bcm and blue luminosities. Using (from the NASA Extragalactic Database) the total corrected blue magnitude of 12.15, we find \u1e40 = 0.81 M\u2299 yr \u22121\nand using the 2.2\u03bcm flux density of 159 mJy, we find\n\u1e40 = 0.62 M\u2299 yr \u22121 . The former value should be an overestimate since it includes any contribution from the AGN\nand the latter should be an underestimate since the 2.2\u03bcm\nflux density is measured only within a central 32\u2032\u2032 aperture. Taking a mass loss rate of 0.7M\u2299 yr \u22121 , then, over 2\n- 4 \u00d7 106 years, stars can contribute, at most, 2.8 \u00d7 106 M\u2299\nof gas to the ISM in NGC 1275. With a gas/dust ratio of\n360 (Sect. 3.2.2), the dust mass generated by stars would\nbe 8 \u00d7 103 M\u2299 , which is 4 orders of magnitude lower than\nobserved. It is possible that 2 orders of magnitude could be\ngained by allowing dust to survive over a timescale one order\nof magnitude longer, since then there could be a contribution from hot massive stars which typically have higher mass\nloss rates than the older stars. However, it is unlikely that\n4 orders of magnitude could be gained and a dust shielding\nmechanism would then also be required. Thus, we conclude\nthat dust cannot be replenished by stellar mass loss. Lester\net al. (1995) came to the same conclusion for NGC 1275 and\n\nGoudfrooij & de Jong (1995) have also found that most elliptical galaxies in which X\u2212ray emission has been detected\ncontain more dust than can be accounted for by stellar mass\nloss. Moreover, if the observed dust originated from stellar\nmass loss, we would expect the dust distribution to bear\nsome resemblance to the stellar light distribution, which is\nnot observed.\nAn obvious source of dust is the infalling galaxy. Goudfrooij et al. (1994), in fact, make a case for all dust in elliptical galaxies being supplied by external systems, and others\n(e.g. Pinkney et al. 1996, Koekemoer et al. 1999) have also\nsupported the merger/accretion origin for dust in ellipticals.\nMcNamara et al. (1996) and N\u00f8rgaard-Nielsen et al. (1993)\nhave suggested, for NGC 1275, that two dust systems may be\npresent, one associated with NGC 1275 and one associated\nwith the the high velocity system. Martel et al. (1999) also\nfind dust absorption at the north-west location of the HVS.\nThese results find some support from our observations since\nthe HVS is observed to the NW of the core of NGC 1275,\nas is the NW sub-mm extension. Thus, the infalling galaxy\nappears to contain dust and, one could argue, is a source of\ndust.\nSeveral lines of argument support this view. There is accumulating evidence that the infalling galaxy is currently interacting with NGC 1275 (Hu et al. 1983; Unger et al. 1990;\nCaulet et al. 1992; N\u00f8rgaard-Nielsen et al. 1993; Ferruit et\nal. 1998). The HVS gas occurs in a patchy distribution over\n\u223c 20 kpc, in projection (Fig. 3e), arguing for a broad interaction region (though the region containing dust is larger\nstill by about a factor of 2). The interaction timescale (impulsive approximation) is roughly ti \u223c d/v, where d is the\nsize of the target galaxy and v is the relative velocity of the\nperturber. If we take the size to be the entire projected region over which dust emission is detected (\u223c 38 kpc) and\nv = 3000 km s\u22121 , we find ti \u223c 1 \u00d7 107 yrs. This is a factor of at least 2 higher than the dust destruction timescale,\nbut this may not be largely discordant, given the approximation made. Finally, our dust mass (6 \u00d7 107 M\u2299 ) and\ngas-to-dust ratio (360) are quite typical of spiral and IRAS\ngalaxies, and our dust temperature (20 K) is also typical of\nspiral galaxies though somewhat cooler than that observed\nin IRAS galaxies (Alton et al. 2000, Dunne et al. 2000), arguing for an infalling spiral galaxy as the origin of the dust.\nIn this scenario, the dust distribution would resemble the\nX-ray gas distribution (Fig. 4) because the dust is widely\ndistributed and is being collisionally heated as discussed in\nSect. 4.1. The implication is that there should be additional\ncold dust, as yet undetected, which is widely distributed in\nNGC 1275. A difficulty with this scenario is that externally\nsupplied dust, initially moving at 3000 km s\u22121 with respect\nto NGC 1275, must \"settle\" into the rest frame of NGC 1275\nwhile the hot stars and associated H\u03b1 emitting gas do not. A\ntheoretical development involving an infalling spiral galaxy\nwhich also interacts with cooling flow gas should be brought\nto bear on this question.\nA final interesting idea is that the dust forms directly\nin the cooling flow (Fabian et al. 1994, Hansen et al. 1995),\nwhich would explain the observed spatial correlation directly. Fabian et al. suggest that dust could form within\nclouds, even in the absence of dust in the cooling flow originally, and would be shielded against destruction, giving it a\nlonger lifetime than the above-determined value. The temc 2000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201313\n\n\fSCUBA Observations of NGC 1275\n\n11\n\nFigure 4. Core-subtracted 850\u03bcm contours (as in Fig. 2f) over a colour image of the X\u2212ray emission taken from the ROSAT HRI\narchive (observer, W. Voges, 1994). The colours range (lowest to highest intensity) from grey through red, yellow, green, blue, violet,\nand black. The low intensity \"holes\" north and south-west of the nucleus are filled with radio continuum emission (see Fig. 3c); for a\nsimilar X\u2212ray image, see B\u00f6hringer et al. (1993).\n\nperature of the dust grains is expected to be is very low,\nwith most of the dust at less than 6 K and some as high as\n11 K. However, as the clouds become disturbed in the inner\npart of the cooling flow, external heating should make the\ndust more visible (and destroy the dust on short timescales\nagain). Since the LVS is known to be associated with the\ncooling flow as well, however, we would also expect the\ndust (unless it is rapidly destroyed) to correlate with the\nLVS in this scenario, for which there is no strong evidence.\nThus, this model seems less attractive, although should not\nbe ruled out pending further work on disentangling density\nfrom temperature effects in the cooling flow region.\n\n5\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have made SCUBA observations of the cD galaxy,\nNGC 1275, which is at the center of the Perseus Cluster\ncooling flow. Emission has been detected at both 850\u03bcm\nand 450\u03bcm and, applying standard radio astronomical techniques such as CLEAN and Maximum Entropy to these\nsub-mm maps, we have removed structures related to the\nbeam shape in order to reveal real low level emission. The\nresulting sub-mm distribution can be easily separated into a\nbright central core and fainter extended emission, allowing\nus to determine the spectral indices of the core and extended\nemission separately.\nThe core has a steep spectral index (-0.88) suggest-\n\nc 2000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201313\n\n\f12\n\nJudith A.Irwin et al.\n\ning that it can be explained primarily in terms of a highfrequency extension of the non-thermal AGN emission. The\nextended emission has a positive spectral index (+2.7), and\nis clearly due to dust which extends as far as 20 kpc from\nthe nucleus. We estimate the dust temperature to be 20 K\n(though 10 K to 30 K is possible, depending on the assumed\nvalue of the dust emissivity index) and rule out the AGN\nas the main heating source, given the presence of dust far\nfrom the nucleus. The dust mass is 6 \u00d7 107 M\u2299 (within\na factor of a few); this dust mass is higher by 2 orders of\nmagnitude than that inferred from optical extinction. Thus\nthere is much more dust in this galaxy than previously realized. The gas-to-dust ratio is found to be 360. Note that\nthe latter value is derived using an assumption of a Galactic\nCO to H2 conversion factor as well as a 100 K spin temperature for neutral hydrogen. Nevertheless, the derived dust\nmass, gas-to-dust ratio, and dust temperature are all typical\nof values being found for spiral galaxies.\nA remarkable correlation between the sub-mm dust\nemission and the X\u2212ray emission is observed in this galaxy,\nalthough there are some displacements in emission peaks.\nWhen the various sources of dust heating are considered,\nthe strongest case can be made for collisional heating by\nhot X\u2212ray emitting electrons. This would explain the spatial correlation between the two components. Since the grain\ndestruction timescale is short (\u223c 4 \u00d7 106 yrs), continuous\ndust replenishment is required to account for the sub-mm\nemission. We have ruled out stars as the source of dust and\nsuggest instead that the infalling galaxy is the most likely\ncandidate, given that the observed dust parameters are typical for spiral galaxies. Thus, we have a picture in which\nthe infalling galaxy is interacting with NGC 1275 over a\nlarge region, supplying it with dust which is then heated\nmost effectively by collisions with hot electrons in the cooling flow gas. If this scenario is correct, then more cold dust\nshould be present in NGC 1275 than we have detected. The\nalternative is that dust forms directly in the cooling flow\nand is shielded from destruction. Further spatially resolved\nmulti-wavelength observations should be able to distinguish\nbetween these scenarios by disentangling density from temperature effects.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis research has made use of data obtained through the\nHigh Energy Astrophysics Science Archive Research Center Online Service, provided by the NASA/Goddard Space\nFlight Center.We are grateful to A.
